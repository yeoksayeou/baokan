<h3>全國性職婦選所　解釋「先行公吿」意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕全國性職婦團體選舉事務所六日及九日兩次公吿之候選人名單中，列有「尙未審查完竣，先行公吿」者是否確認「合格」一問題，頃據該所發言人稱，候選人登記截止後之「審查」期間，法定僅有五日，在今日交通與郵件困難之情形下，簽署書之發交查對，往返週轉，實非此短短五日即可藏事「故下級選所大多為趕公吿時間，先行電報姓名，陳明簽署書另行郵寄。此項簽署書，自不能於公吿期前全部　到所，曾經本所第八次選舉委會議決議：　電報加註查對按語者，予以公吿，無按語者先行公吿。　屬於個人電報而於最後公吿期間前收到簽署者准予先行公吿。本所兩次公吿之標明「尙未審查完竣，先行公吿」者，即因上述事實而根據決議辦理。至謂先行公吿之候選人，是否為巳取得「合格」之地位，此點本所第七次委員會議曾決議？：「如選舉前查對不符者即予註銷，選舉後查對不符者即宣吿其當選無效」。依上論列，即在最後一次本月十五日補行公吿中，尙列為先行公吿者，亦無須再經審查公吿手續，即可認有候選資格，其理至為明顯，惟本所於最後公吿前，仍當隨時積極查對，凡前經先行公吿，如已審查合格者，仍於公吿時提出，將先行公吿改為公吿，如九日公吿名單甲項所列之葉祿夫等廿一名，即係依此辦理，預計十五日最後公吿之期，此項先行公吿改為公吿之名單，必然更為加多。惟可能仍有一部分不及改為公吿者，但並不影響其候選之資格。又中國國民黨提名為全國性各職婦團體國代候選名單，業由選舉總事務所轉交全國性職婦選所，經該所登記審查後通過唐承宗等二百零五十人，今巳在京公吿。</p>

<h3>顧維鈞談聯合國問題　指責不合作態度　盼以中庸之道挽救危機</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十一日電〕顧維鈞犬使十一日晚於此間國外報業協會宴會中，間接指責蘇聯在聯合國大會中採取不合作態度，使全球成為兩個不同而似無從調和之陣綫時，掌聲雷動。顧氏謂：聯合國之企求和平努力所以成為艱難之工作者，蓋在對人類前途至為重要之所有事物中，幾均有兩個世界。渠叙述此兩分立世界如下：　在經濟方面，資本主義與共產主義互相脾睨，彼此均稱無對方容身餘地。　民主一方基於一黨專政，反對黨無投票權利，另一方承認人民之選舉自由，並不時以良好態度接受反對黨之勝利。　合作一方表示至少願與對方獲得妥協，另一方則期望對方完全順從已意，否則即不合作。　和平一方希望能藉供給救濟與協助善後兩種工作，使全球安謐復原並繁榮，另一方則仍持猜忌，對解決全球問題之稽延與不定，漠不關心。至上述種種分歧，是否將成為另一次世界大戰之前奏，顧氏援引詭辯人士之語謂：「凡欲煽動亂事者，不能成事，而能成事者，則不願為之。」渠並稱：迄今尙無人提出解決此兩種不同觀念而能為人所接受之折衷方案，故渠主張採取中庸之道，以應付聯合國未來問題，此即從最惡劣處着想，但匆放棄關於最佳結果之希望與努力。</p>
<h3>美國正尋求切實辦法　助我改善通通貨難題　馬歇爾繼續說明援華立塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾國務卿出席衆院外交委員會，就對外援助問題續有所說明。渠稱：國務院切盼援助中國，並謂，中國之局勢與歐洲之局勢不同，美國政府希望此項援助能發生效力。馬氏續稱：歐洲需要緊急援助，以防重要貨物之輸入陷於停頓，不然即將發生饑　與工業上之破產。惟中國問題不同，中國之輸入並不遭遇立即陷於停頓之威脅，且中國有資源。渠謂，通貨膨脹問題為中國之難題，必須助其改善，而中國政府亦應採取若干防止通貨膨脹之步驟，吾人正設法尋求切實辦法，俾使吾人給予中國之援，能獲得至少百分之七十的效果。本人即根據此種立塲，向國會提出對外援助問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕國務卿馬歇爾在參院外委會宣稱：除援歐與佔領軍經費二十五億九千七百萬美元以外，將請國會在明年七月一日以前撥款六千萬美元援助歐與佔領軍經費二十五億九千七百萬美元以外，將請國會在明年七月一日以前撥款六千萬美元援助中國。副國務卿洛維特稱：明年六月三十日以後，對華援助如果繼續，每月需款約二千萬美元。官方估計，長期援華計劃截至一九四九年七月一日止，較諸在歐洲用去十元對於吾人之目標更有價値。六千萬美元僅係初步需要，統盤需要總數現尙不明，但中國所需要者為糧食與貨物，而非金錢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕魏德邁報吿，在不久之後，即可能將秘密打開。此事已由參議員塔虎特加以暗示，渠曾宣布，渠反對馬歇爾之請求，以六千萬美元作為對華援助三億計劃中之第一批貸款。塔虎特秘密吿新聞界稱：「共和黨方面對魏德邁報吿，當然將提出發表要求」。塔虎特關於共和黨未來政策，經人長時連續質詢時，始發表此項言論。按塔虎特此項聲明，與其在紐約發表援華與歐洲需同考慮之演說，相隔僅有一日。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕官方人士今日聲稱：美國在一九四九年七月一日前，僅以三億美元資助中國，除非附帶其他贈款，否則殊不滿足中國之希望與需要，最高當局對於美國務卿馬歇爾在國會之聲明雖抱緘默，但一般輿論認為，此種有限的援華計劃，非獲補充，必不能解決中國之嚴重局勢。</p>

<p>暹羅自九日發生政變以來，局勢迄未十分澄淸，各國政府當局亦尙多保持　　。據報傳消息，比次暹羅政變，係由曾與日本合作者之前「泰國」總理　被汶所發動，曼谷一帶，尙無流血情事。至十日，新政府亦吿成立，以阿斐璜出任　理，　披汶則退居幕後；一面宣布　敬議會，改訂新憲，廢攝政王府，而以即將成年現在瑞士之國君密　親臨國政，佐以五人所組成之權密　。此新成立之　密院即修改憲法，使暹羅國王重　有若干巳被廢棄之權力，一面又恢復兩院議會的舊制，而在日內瓦的暹羅國王亦已凖備接受旣成事實。至此，暹羅政變以來的局勢，似乎漸　安定。然據路透社十一日從曼谷傳來的消息，則請暹羅新政權最高副統帥芬宗哈文中將稱：暹羅正規革巳與「暹羅人民抵抗軍」發生戰爭，當局已下令全國各地防軍，凖備於二十四小時內出動，則此次暹羅的政變，勢恐仍將難免流血。暹羅局勢之迄未十分澄淸者也在此。我們綜合各方報道，以為對暹羅局勢有如下幾點，値得注意：</p>
<p>第一，此次暹羅的政變，似非一宗突發事件；實有其歷史的淵源。不用說旁的，此次變披汶的重又握權，我們推究其導因，不難於去年五月中暹羅王府適　的被殺中見之。在去年四月，暹羅王麻海道爾簽署命令，頒布新憲，其特色為兩院議會制和政黨活動的公開。但不出一月，國王即被暗殺，至今眞相未白。而此次政變的結果，其第一件工作，便在修正此項憲法，回復兩院議會制及上院議員的遴　。是此次的政變，似不免與去　國王的被殺不無關係。</p>
<p>第二，　被汶為此次政變的首腦，而功成不居，甘處幕後，其手段在表面上看固屬相當高明，但仍不能掩天下人之耳目。　被汶學有「暹羅墨索里尼」之號，他是一個參加日本軍閥號召的「大東亞共榮團」的人物。以他在暹羅的聲望，固然可以左右暹羅的政局，但以他在過去日本軍閥統治下的地位，照現實在不能使他再露頭角。所以此次政變，雖由　披汶所推動，而出面的却是民主黨人物如阿獨斐璜之流。像出現在英法的局勢一樣，此次暹羅的政變，多少似具有英法市選一樣的結果，就是表示右傾勢力的再抬頭，不過在暹羅所表現的，色彩更濃，而跡近於法西斯罷了。在這局勢之下，縱使暹羅境內容有抵抗，不免流血，但大勢所趨，抵抗恐將無效。然無論如何，此次政變，總不能不說是違反民主潮流的作風。</p>
<p>第三，此次暹羅的政變，據公吿的消息，是為了使暹羅腐敗的內政吿一結束，以圖改善人民生活，澄淸吏治；然據報傳消息，我們不難窺見此次暹羅的政變與其說是對內的，似毋寗說是對外的。此可於兩方面中見之。第一，暹羅越南邊境的糾紛，迄未解決，暹羅過去在日人的協助下，曾與維希法蘭西訂約，以越南一部地讓與暹羅。大戰結束，此約也被法蘭撕毀；然而暹羅終未能忘情於東埔寨一帶土地。　　汶是當時在邊境作戰的　軍統帥，他所領導的政變成功，毋寧說是對越南的一種威脅。政變成功以後，　　當局似將重提　越劃界的要求，以掩飾國內局勢未能改善。其次，暹羅的政變，似為對華盛頓頻送的秋波，也許就是　被汶在政治舞台上的又一次投機。此次　披所領導的政變，實得民主黨的　援；而民主黨的人物，又多　　份子，總理阿斐璜到過美國，為暹羅向聯合國的請國代表，此外，前駐美大使而高唱過「自由泰國」的普拉摩，又為暹羅民主黨首要人物，他在過去作戰時，又是曾與美國的　報戰略局保持着接觸的，可見暹羅的政變，多少不免具有投入美國懷抱的恣態。</p>
<p>就我們中國的立塲來看，此次暹羅的政變，將是「大泰族主義」口號再抬頭的朕兆。站在三民主義的觀點，我們本樂於看見暹羅民族主義的抬頭，但以　被汶為象徵的「大泰族主義」在過去不免有岐視我國在暹華僑的情事，就是在日本接受了波茨坦聲明以後，尙復有大規模的排華運動，對我僑的胞實施屠殺刦掠，一面又幕擬「收回失地」的希特勒作風，對居留我西南邊芪的夷族人民，特別是在雲南境內的「擺夷」，時有顗覦拉攏的妄念。因之，自次　披汶所領導的政變成功，或將即是「大泰族」運動的死灰復燃。我們願見暹羅民族的抬頭，但不願見排華及侵華運動的再起，而我們尤其不能忘懷於　披汶過去助日為的對聯合國作戰。　披汶果欲自新，應該首先改變他舊時的政策，則中暹關係，方纔不致會發生惡劣的影響。</p>

<h3>平捕獲共匪案軍法處長談話</h3>
<p>「逕行逮捕」於法有據</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕本市月前破獲共匪間謀案件，內容複雜，因本案之綫索，各地尙續有破獲，此一重要案件之處置，自為各方所注目．記者特訪平警備總部軍法處尹處長，探詢對於此案處理辦法，據談：　本案之內容，現猶未至發表時期，將來當由中央統一公佈，惟可奉吿者，即捕獲各犯均屬罪證確　，並經供認不諱，孟憲功給胡校長的信裏，承認「作出犯法的事，萬分慚愧」可以看出他們現在心理的一斑。　關於偵審問題，依照國府頒布之本部組織規程，對於治案案件，有偵查審判之權，本案對治安關係重大，且案情牽涉頗廣，尙在繼續偵查，此為本部職權，並為本部責任。至其中無軍人身份之共犯，在偵查階段，屬於本部的職權，至將來審判權誰屬問題，已經是呈報中央解釋，候中央核示，即可決定，惟無論司法軍法，都是根據法律進行審判，社會上一部份人士，以為軍法審判較為嚴重，並通司法較為輕鬆，實為錯誤觀念。　本案案情重大，共犯衆多，且都是現行犯，為免證據湮沒，共犯逃逸，須「逕行捸捕」，在事實上應該如此辦理，在法律上亦有根據，曾有報紙指摘本案報吿被捕為「非法逮捕」，並且說本部未將此案迅移法院為「拖延」，其立論似不無誤會之處。總之，本案關係重大，自當以極審愼之態度，在合理合法的原則下，從事偵查訊辦。</p>
<h3>有關于子三案　三犯被公訴　秘密組社帮助共黨</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州十二日電〕與浙大于子三案有關之陳建新，黃世民，　伯瑾三人，業經浙高等法院檢察官李載彭偵查終結，於十二日正式提起公訴，茲將起訴書內所列犯罪事實證據及所犯法條誌下：</p>
<p>綠陳建新，黃世民，　伯瑾等，外語民國三年春，在貴州湄潭有新潮社之組織，即受共黨指使，擴大範圍，共社員分佈於上海，杭州，南京，無錫，常州，台北，奉化，平湖各地，由陳建新担任社長，黃世民担任會計股長，酈伯瑾担任學術股長，積極推行社務，其</p>
<p>主要工作</p>
<p>計有三種：　開闢勤耕農塲，作為該社事業之經濟基礎。　組織競選機構，由該社杭州負責人于子三（已故）籌劃，在浙江大學內爭取各系級學生自治會代表席次，秘密參加中共所領導之全國學聯會，冀圖操縱學潮。　創設讀書會，由該社學術股長酈伯瑾主持，蒐集各種左傾書報，灌輸共產理論，秘密吸收社員，策動共黨外圍工作，被吿陳建新，黃世民，上月二十五日，携帶大批秘密文件，由滬來杭，召集于子三，酈伯瑾，至大同旅館，深夜秘議，治安當局依據京滬密報，追踪竊聽，當塲逮捕，並搜獲文件，除于子三一名口，在保安司令部羈押時自殺外，餘均解送偵查到院。</p>
<p>證據及所犯法條：查被吿陳建新，黃世民，酈伯瑾，均任新潮社主要職務，該社並未向政府登記，而社務則已積極推行，運用經費</p>
<p>數額甚鉅</p>
<p>均為被吿等所自認，且有當塲搜獲之經費收據收支賬可稽。該社又在浙大內組織秘密機構，爭取學生自治會代表，以圖參加　中共所領導之全國學聯會，亦有于子三在原送談話紀錄內所供「有人命令我這樣做，甚麼人我現在不能講」等語，足資證實。至創設讀書會灌輸共黨主義，此觀乎被吿酈伯瑾所擬之學習綱要，極為明瞭，况在讀書目錄中，列有聯共黨史，唯物辯證法，思想方法論初步，毛澤東七大文獻，「四大家族」，及紅色遍中國（Red　star　over　China）等五十餘種，全屬左派理論書籍，並分別傳讀，限期報吿，又有酈伯瑾之之親筆記載，可資證明，其為配合共黨之秘密敎育方式，尤屬信而為徵。復查該社各種活動方式，已接受共黨作法，事實上已與共黨</p>
<p>貫通一氣</p>
<p>並負聯絡之責，又經于子三在原送談話筆錄內，明白陳述無異，此種共犯人之陳述，自可採為犯罪之證據。按共黨意圖竊據國土，顚覆政府，罪行昭著，業經政府命令，戡亂在案，被吿陳建新，黃世明，酈伯瑾等，旣執行新潮社之重要任務，而新潮社之任務，又係帮助共黨推行策劃，加强訓練，已如上述證明，則被吿等不無觸犯刑法第三十條第一項，第一百餘第一項之嫌欵，被吿等均為靑年學子，因意志不能堅定，致入岐途，情雖可憫，但旣觸犯刑章，自應依法訴究，除被吿于子三在本院受理前業已死亡，應免予置議外，合依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項之規定，提起公訴。</p>

<h3>獨步國內的陜省棉產（下）　本報西安航信·特派記者胡昶</h3>
<p>上海紡調會，最近為與合棉紗聯合憑證配銷辦法，又決定先在西安等六區，實施棉花聯合議價，議價辦法，北方暫以八分之七時細絨白花一市担之價格，相當於中等小麥七市担為標凖。現在此地糧價與棉價，背道而馳，普通花衣每担約合二百萬元，而小麥每担日來巳喊六十萬元，這此例顯然失去了均衡，而二百萬元一担的花衣，加上運佛，運抵上海，與上海市價相衡，這算盤巳打不過來，要再照小麥七担的標凖議價，必致議而不行，徒然擾亂花市，無補於事實。吳味經先生來此第和，此地中央銀行曾召集各關係方面會談二次，結論一致認為在目前現狀下，西安棉花的議價，暫無必要。</p>
<p>西安的棉業界，都認為面對陜棉的二重難關，一是現鈔短細，一是運輸受阻，二重難關不打破，陜棉的出路和價格，都將無法振作。中央銀行的現鈔，常時靠飛機載運，每次一二百億元，一到就被各銀號搶個精光，以致支票發生了貼水現象，最高時到過一成。比這更嚴重的運輸問題，越使阻塞前，陜棉還能源源大量的向外輸出，現在可不成了，目前大家走的路綫，不外三條：第一條是由西安經實鷄到重慶，再沿大江東下到上海，這條路目前全，時間可不經濟，前後需四十天左右，這條路的運輸的成本，每噸化衣扯到一千一百萬元左右。第二條是由西安經安康到老河口，再裝船東下，時間前後需一個月，運輸成本約扯七百萬元一噸，這條路綫距離比較近，尙合理想。最後一條是沿西荆公路（西安到荆門）到漢口東下，這條路所需的時間和運輸成本，約為第二條路綫的一半，可是在商縣羅南一帶，治安不靖，沒有確切的把握。末了，還得提到空運路綫，一架飛機的運棉量，不過五噸半，而每噸花衣運到滬，須成本二千四百萬元，不經濟姑且不認經，單以這杯水車薪的運輸量，夠派得了什麼用處？</p>
<p>目前為了運輸受阻，滿坑滿谷的上好陜棉，貶到了二百萬元的低價，出手仍不見舒暢，不無影響到陜省棉農植棉的興趣。另一方面，上海的紗廠，花了高額的運費，百費週折的運抵上海，算盤仍打不出，結果都只得望陜棉而却步，這現象矛盾到了極點。</p>
<p>四日晚，西安的工商界領袖舉行了個盛大的宴會，歡迎吳味經先生，吳先生應邀報吿了上海棉紗聯合配銷及紡調會實施棉花議價的動機後，即席聽取西安工商界的意見，陜西省財政廳彽陳慶瑜氏站在地方政府的立塲，希望當前的棉花議價，不要高到使紗廠不能再生產，也不要抵得使棉農不再植花，陜西省農業改進所長李國楨氏，瞻望陜棉未來的培植，要求注意水利，肥料，和去除虫害三大問題，還有一致置迫切的要求，就是解決現鈔和運輸的兩大窒礙。為了保存推廣這份　厚純正的棉產，為了促進棉農來年增產興緻，為了解決全國紗廠再生產的原料問題，這些火急的建議，値得　請中樞各關係當局，從連謀取合理的解決。（四日晚於西安）</p>

<h3>譴責弗朗哥政權問題　聯合國舊事重提　中美等國反對經濟制裁</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十一日電〕中國代表蔣廷蔽今日在聯大政委會中宣稱：西班牙無疑爲一極權政權，中國與西班牙間無外交關係存在。軍事制裁當然不適於時，蓋此舉缺乏法　根據。關於經濟制裁，吾人能否在憲章中發現其法理根據，亦頗成問題。經濟制裁將使人民受苦，而執行制裁之國家中亦可能產生貧窮。蔣氏警告稱，弗朗哥可能利用經濟制裁，以增強國內之希望，。弗朗哥政權去年一年中依然故我，一成不變，故今年聯大會不必前進或後退。有人提議重申</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕美代表法海今日在聯大政委會反對蘇聯集團主張以經濟制裁手段推翻西班牙弗朗哥政權。據稱，美國反對用暴力發動改革之任何行動。西班牙人民在適當時間及在其自身　之辦法中，將採取各項步驟，恢復其國際地位。波瀾代表郎曾於去年四月在安里會中攻擊弗朗，此次又要求委員會與聯大援用聯合國憲章規定，與西班牙全部或局部斷絕經，濟關於。據稱，去年十二月十二日大會通過決議案，呼召會員國召回其駐西使節，同時，西民主政府倘不再適當時期內成立，安理會應考慮適當步驟，自是以來局勢並未改善。蘇代表葛羅米柯擁護朗琪稱，英美並不召回其使節，其對西關係反益形敦睦，各該過間之貿易已增加。捷南代表，亦擁護朗琪，美荷比墨加巴基斯坦秘魯智利則反對。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾初步援外估計塔虎脫認為過高　對哈里曼報告亦表不滿</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕國務卿罵歇爾十一日告國會稱：本會計年度美國援外需款二十六億五千七百萬美元後，共和黨領袖議員塔虎脫立即宣稱：渠「斷然反對允許如此之多」。塔氏拒絕表示渠所主張之數字究爲多少，但稱渠將審查此項計劃。渠對馬歇爾所謂行政當局對於明年四月一日開始之十五個月計劃，需要七十五億美元之款，其中十五億包括於本日所提之要求中，亦拒絕評論。據塔氏指出，渠認爲哈里曼委員會所建議之緊急援助數字五億七千五百萬美元「太高，頗爲危險」。</p>
<h3>戴高樂鼓吹英美法聯盟</h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎十二日電〕戴高樂今日在招待記者會中，呼籲英法美聯盟，以抵制世界之共產威脅，而促進歐洲之重建。</p>
<p>關於第三次大戰之可能性，渠答稱，「不正視事覺即爲不智，新戰爭雖爲一種可能性，然我人必須面對是項可能性而加以準備。」渠相信渠之運動，可不籍內戰而攫取政權，渠稱，「余不信法國公意之欲內戰或武裝破壞，然如果有戰事發生，法律方面必須維持其力量。」渠又建議訂立法義協定，以反抗共產之威脅而重新組織西歐。戴高樂又稱，法國最主要目標，爲防止德國再成爲中央集權之國家。渠最後稱，渠一向不贊成弗朗哥西班牙，然此並不妨碍我人與目前對西關係，特別爲經濟上之關係。</p>

<h3>美·蘇·互·責阻撓原子能協定</h3>
<p>〔食衆社紐約十二日電〕國外報業協會今晚舉行第卅週紀念，同時亦紀念第二屆聯合國年宴。蘇代表離辛斯基及美代表奧斯疔均應邀赴宴，發表演說。雜奧二人互責對方阻撓使節管制原子能協定之成立。維辛斯基重申前言稱聯合國無權過問朝鮮問題。維氏對一年前「禁止原子彈之決議迄無成效」一事，表示這能，並指斥「美外交領袖以爲能蘇斷原子彈」，　外之肯似蘇聯已具有原子彈。蘇代表宣佈蘇外交政策之動機爲和平，而由罵歇　計訊及杜魯門主義所表現之美國政策則爲對蘇「仇視及中傷」。奧斯汀駁斥莫洛托夫上週宣佈壓力彈秘密已不再存在之演說，渠反駁蘇聯所稱美國阻撓世界原子協定，並稱，參加原子能委會者十五國，除蘇聯及波蘭外，各國已對基本問題一致協議，故阻撓之咎在於斯抗夫集團。</p>

<h3>美琪戲完盛會　紀念國父誕辰精神重於形式　出席各首長相繼致詞勗勉</h3>
<p>「本報訊」昨日爲國父誕辰紀念日，全市懸旗慶祝，各機關學校銀行均休假一天。上午九時，上海市各界，假座美琪大戲院舉行慶祝總理誕辰紀念大會，到有各界代表及市民千餘人。主席團吳國楨，李石曾，潘公展，宣鐵吾，方治，張維，張曉崧，曹俊，謝仁釗，王曉籟，水祥雲，王先靑，金振玉等。</p>
<p>大會開始，由吳市長領導行禮如儀，即席致詞略稱：吾人應默念國父偉大之處，加以效法。國父之一舉一動，全係爲民族爲國家，卒至推翻滿淸，創造民國。凡吾國民，均應深自檢討是否自私自利？所作所爲是否對得起國家民族？受國父偉大精神之感召而身體力行。中委李石曾致詞，闡述三民主義之最終目的爲求世界大同。值此總理誕辰，祇抽象的形式的紀念並無意義，須精神的並在工作上具體表現。</p>
<p>效法革命精神</p>
<p>國民黨市黨部方主任委員致詞：略訊：我們紀念國父應當對革命的環境和自己的責任，重新加以檢討省察，我們今後應當如何努力呢？第一：效法國父的革命精神，國父一生盡瘁革命，不知經過多少次失敗，然而失敗一次，革命的信心堅決一次，失敗爲成功之母，卒能克服艱難困苦，貫澈他的主張。國父在倫敦蒙難，又在廣州蒙難，都能臨難不屈，處之泰然，這利堅決的意志，不屈不撓的精神，是値得我們效法的。不僅國父如此，蔣主席亦如此，當陳逆炯明叛變的時候，主席時在原籍奉化，聞訊後不分畫夜，兼程赴難，這種同患難共生死的精神，實在値得我們效法。</p>
<p>厲行節衣縮食</p>
<p>第二：效法國父的節約精神，－國父奔走革命，歷盡辛苦，處處爲國家爲民族而奮鬥，對於自已的衣食住行，毫不注意。國父對於衣更不講究，連一套完整的長袍馬褂也沒有，某次接見外賓，祗好臨時向現任考試院戴院長借用，這套衣服直到後來在北平逝世後，才由孫夫人包好，送還給戴先生。我們主席受到國父的薰陶，其節約的精神，也與國父一樣，主席吃得異常簡單，穿得異常樸素，與一般奢侈的人相較，眞有天壤之別。總之，我們今天在節約，一面要效法國父的節約精神，更要以主席的節約生活，爲全國國民日常生活的模範。</p>
<p>加緊剿匪建國</p>
<p>第三：加緊剿匪建國－我們要效法國父的革命精神，效法國父的節約精神，爲的甚麼？爲的是剿匪建國。而京上海來說，我們要求社會秩序的安定，所謂「安定第一，建設當先」我們不容許共匪地下工作份子及其應聲虫在上海搗亂破壤。講到建國，我們要奉行國父遺教，實施民主憲政，現在大選期近，各省市都要辦理國代，立委，監委的選舉，上海爲全國觀瞻所繋，又爲國際信譽攸關，對於此次大選，更當特別注意。從事競選的人，要有民主政治的風度，和民主政治的道德，選舉人應該注重人格，重視選舉權，不可輕視自己，放棄權利。我們要使民主政治的作用，在上海盡量的發揮，以上海的選舉，作全國的模範。</p>
<p>繼續。完成遺志</p>
<p>潘議長致詞稱：今日全國正築中意志集巾力量在剿匪建國。主席早已指示剿匪工作爲三分軍事，七分政治。無開明之政治配合，剿匪不能迅速完成，而如政治不淸明，則一方面在剿匪，一方面因人民不能生活，貧困煩悶，即是無形中在製造匪。孟子有言「上無道揆，下無法守」，這一個國家一定要亡國，有道揆是德治，有法守是法治，在道德法律範圍之內治理國家，政治一定淸明。憲法第一條有言中華民國爲基於三民主義民權民治民事之共和國，今日吾人以三民主義爲道揆，憲法爲法守，要上有法守，下有道揆，則三民主義共和國可建。國父一生爲國爲民，鞠躬盡　　　　　已，其遺志尚待吾人未死者來繼續完成。繼由宣司令，王曉　，金振玉等相繼致詞。</p>

<p>停戰兩年以來，各國復興進展極速，法國工業生產已恢復至戰前百分之九十三，比·荷·盧幾全部恢復，義國恢復達百分之六十，德國西部英美佔領區恢復亦達百分之四十六，英國戰時損失雖重，近來商船噸位，約已恢復半數，出口貿易已超過戰前數值，工業生產，更增至戰前百分之一百十五。實際上各國復興方案，大都不外增產節用及管制物價，金融等類通常辦法，並無出奇的秘诀，亦無取巧的捷徑，所以奏效如此之速，原因雖有種種，其中最要者，仍爲長期鍜鍊的民主政治，政府能明辨是非，嚴行賞罰，有貫澈政令的決心，人民能認淸利害，奉公守法，對國家悉抱蓋共休戚共存亡的精神。本人去國年餘，對於國內近情不甚諳悉，今後自當與各方隨時接觸商討，希望對當前的經濟問題，能作若干切合實際的建議。</p>

<h3>王曉籟返滬　盛讚美人守法　報攤無需人管理公民無一不識字</h3>
<p>「本報訊〕全國商聯會王理事長曉籟，於上月六日乘中航公司中美錢首次客機訪美，業於昨日返滬。前後凡三十五日，行遍半個美國。昨晚記者特趨訪王氏，請發表此行觀感，據談：此次訪美完全以私人資格，並無任何名義，美國所有諸大城市及重要工業，永利中心地幾已遍歷，到處承旅美僑胞及當地之商業團體熱忱招待，領導參觀，並詳爲解釋，得增加不少見聞。美國政治之民主與法治精神，雖久爲人稱道，然不親歷其境，終難知其眞切。此番在美三十多天，始得領略其眞情。每一政令必能貫澈，國民均能守法。例如汽車違章，發察趨前糾正並授以通知書一紙，駕駛人於翌日自行依通知書投所指定之警局領受處罰，治安確已能做到夜不閉戶，路不拾遺。紐約市各街道旁出售報紙之櫃台，行人購報時自行取報，並將應付之值，投入箱中，並無人管理，但無取報不付值者。汽車行於路上絕少撳喇叭，足見其交通秩序之優良。更可稱道者，美國國民教育之普及發達，誠可供我國借鏡，自小學至高中皆爲强迫之義務敎育，一切費用均由國家負担，書籍文具。亦均免費供給，如父母不令子女入學，則父母需受法律處分。故美國公民無一不識字者，大學生到處皆是。機械之使用，已登峯造極，非唯工業使用機械，即農業已完全機械化，一農夫藉機械之帮助，耕地達數百畝。</p>
<p>王氏又稱，美國之繁華，已臻眞善美之　境，上至白宮，下至農舍，無不盡華盡美。即小小一水菓舖佈置，亦莫不力求美化。香蕉，蘋菓皆依色澤分列，招徠主顧。</p>
<p>美國商業廣告性之滑稽播音，王氏譽爲「活的滑稽」。其方法與本市電台中唱滑稽者逈然不同，彼藝員演滑稽時任聽眾自由發問，由其當塲答覆，蓋聽眾必擇最突然，最尷尬之題目發問，藝員必能以最敏捷最滑稽之口吻答覆。現美國無綫電聽眾人人喜收聽此類「滑稽」，因之廣告效力亦甚宏大。</p>
<h3>爪哇歸客私貨案　丁貴堂剖白</h3>
<p>「本報訊」近日報載副總稅務司丁貴堂，到碼頭迎接中南銀行黃裕沂，涉有庇私嫌疑一事，頗引起外界注意。記者昨特走訪向丁副總稅務司叩以當日經過情形。據稱：黃君裕沂爲多年友好，此次由爪哇乘芝渣連加輸返國，本人以友誼關係，到埠迎接，原屬人情之常。當時黃君旣未手提行李，本人亦未知其帶有行李若干，僅囑值勤關員對於黃君行李可予儘速「查騐」放行。迨至是日午後六時，中南銀行有人用電話告知，黃君行李被扣，不知何故。當即電詢關員究竟。據報，所携行李頗多，其中似有可疑之處。當囑主管關員按章辦理，同時並電復中南，告以關章所在，本人歉難帮忙。此係在本人方面當日經過之全部事實，有江海關値勤關員報吿可資考證。至其行李之內，是否確有私貨。尚待查驗，設果有私貨，江海關自當按照定章外理，本人不但不便，且亦不願預聞過問。本人服務海關已三十餘載，自信奉公守法，律已謹嚴，旣不經商牟利，亦不舞弊營私。若謂庇護走私，更屬入關以來所未嘗夢想。現雖住有邸舍，出有代步，無一非公有產物，如其一旦不作關吏，則住行立生問題，即衣食亦難免感覺恐慌矣。本人受海關良好紀律之陶鎔，且生性　直，守法不阿，或因是不免開罪於人。十數年來，被人在層峯方面匿名誣控，揑詞構陷者，實繁有徒，而結果均屬無的放矢。此在院部署方面，均有案可稽。平生立身處世，一本良心，自問對國對關，差可以告無忝職責。不過當茲人欲橫流道義淪喪之秋，殊不能不令人與「作官難，作好官尤難」之歎云。</p>
<h3>具有歷史價値古代殉葬之俑　博物館中陳列六朝唐代遺物各種姿態不同看去栩栩如生</h3>
<p>「本報特寫」市立博物館中，陳列着一種稱爲「俑」的六朝與唐代時的遺物。</p>
<p>所謂「俑」，可以解釋作「死者的奴隸或僕役」，是一種像玩偶一般的塗磁的泥人，　在洛陽附近的古人墳墓中發現的最多。</p>
<p>我們中國的風俗，相信人在死後靈魂不滅，有鬼與冥府的存在，並且鬼也與人一樣，有次食住行的需要，所以在人死的時候，他的家屬就要替他預備死後的享受。現代民間風俗用焚化紙糊的其人與冥器以供死者的差遣及使用，但在六朝與唐代則用泥土製成「俑」與其器，外面都塗釉磁，繪釉彩，與死者一起埋葬在墳墓裘。</p>
<p>形形色色種類不一</p>
<p>博物館中陳列的「俑」最大的約有兩尺高，最小的也有三四吋，種類形形色色，有手持　　的「文俑」，有特盾騎馬的「武俑」，有作舞蹈　勢的「舞俑」，也有作滑格姿態的「小丑俑」，這些古代的遺物，雖然隔了道麼多年才發掘出來，但除了釉彩剝落之外，看上去還是栩栩如生。</p>
<p>有一種稱爲「胡俑」，鬆髮，凹眼，高鼻，面貌與西洋人極爲相似。一個「胡俑」的鼻子是鷹爪鼻，另一個「胡俑」的嘴唇留有翹起的八字　。有幾個「胡俑」的腰部側面突出一塊，遠望如現代人掛的手槍，想來也是當時的一種武器，這類「胡俑」，其職司大槪有如現代的保鑣之頰。又有一個裸體的「胡俑」，形狀有些像南洋土人，其臀部的突出，達於「荒謬」的程度，這大　是唐人想像中的　張吧。</p>
<p>爲什麼唐代人的墳墓中會有這麼多的「胡俑」呢？據考古學家推測，在六朝與唐代，我們國家强盛，百姓富裕，與西域及南洋的接觸必相當頻繁，那時候的邊疆官吏或富貴之家可能都買些所謂「胡人」來做僕役或奴隸，所以在人死後還製成「胡俑」來陪葬。</p>
<p>所穿服裝極爲有趣</p>
<p>「胡俑」之外，又有像黑人的「小崑崙俑」，像日本人的「侏儒俑」，製作都很精美，更有一具「小崑崙俑」，其錢條近似希臘的彫像，可見當時的藝術成績了。</p>
<p>各種「俑」身上穿的服裝，極爲有趣，不少男服竟極像現代前面翻領後擺弧形的西裝大衣與燕尾服，女「俑」的服裝則有坦胸露臂與現代西洋婦女的晚禮服相同的，並有幾個手中挽着提包，與現代的玻璃皮包一式無二。更有趣的是女「俑」的　式，竟有中間分開前面高聳的，那眞可以語是「飛機顯」的鼻祖了。</p>

<h3>前駐德大使程天放演講　戰後美國趨勢　關心世界各國動向對華政策將有改變</h3>
<p>「本報訊」漫遊美國歸來之前駐德大使程天放，昨晚應靑年會邀謂，作兩小時之公開講演，講題爲「戰後美國之趨勢」，從交通，工業，敎育，經濟，社會問題，世界政策各方面，作一廣泛而扼要的叙述。茲誌其講詞大意如下：</p>
<p>「兄弟是二十年前留學美國，此次舊地重遊，感覺美國較廿年前進步多多。　交通方面，火車的設備大爲改良，有活動躺椅，與飛機內躺椅一樣。火車的速率增加，一小時可行八十哩，而且坐在裹面幷不感覺震動。公路已改成水門汀路面，路面之闊可容八部汽車同時駛行。而最進步的是航空交通，其網綫之密，幾與鐵道相等。因此在美國買飛機票與買火車票一樣的簡單。飛機的速度也在一天天增加，現在從西雅圖橫渡太平洋到上海，中途不停，三十二小時可到，兄第參觀西雅圖飛機工廠，見建造中之同溫層飛機，可坐八十人。明年如乘該一機由西雅圖到上海，只要一天時間就可飛到。</p>
<p>加緊製造汽車冰箱</p>
<p>工業情形，　術方面也有很大的進步，第一個原因德奧的第一流科學家被美國　致，第二個原因是受戰爭的刺激，使對工業的研究發明加速度的進行。現在美國將軍用工廠一律復員爲民用工廠，如汽車·冰箱·無綫電收音機等均加緊製造。惟因戰爭四年未曾製造，故非常感覺缺乏。一般人以爲在美國買汽車等物品容易，事實不然，因爲需要的人多，常常有登記了幾個月之後才能買到一部。現在美國的鋼鐵最高額是年產一萬萬噸，汽油年產十四萬萬桶，比世界各國的出產總數還要多。　教育文化情形，美國高等敎育至爲發達。加洲大學學生最多，有四萬三千人。哥倫比亞大學有四萬餘人。伊里諾洲大學有二萬八千人。專科以上的學生共有三百餘萬人。以與我國大學生僅有十一萬人相較，自不可同日而語。美國敎育不獨在量的方面增加。質的方面亦有改進。如原子彈之發明，即係美國科學家研究之結果。現在國防部，農林部均協助各大學作科學之研究。大工廠爲使其出品精進起見，亦建立完備之實騐室，聘請科學家研究。</p>
<p>一般物價約漲一倍</p>
<p>經濟情形，戰後各國人民生活水準均皆降低，惟美國仍保持戰前之票準，物價上漲極緩，自珍珠港事件至日本投降，物價約漲百分之三十至三十五。戰後取消管制，漲至百分之六十至七十，迄今一般物價約爲　前一倍，而公用事業，不獨未漲，反而减少，如地下鐵這二十年前五分錢，現在仍爲五分錢。戰爭期間航空信國內一角，寄至中國七角五分，現在减爲國內五分，寄至中國二角五分，美國人一般收入亦增加一倍，美國全國人民一年總收入爲一千八百億美金。每人平均侮年收入一千三百美金，收入之多冠於世界各國。戰後有一千三百萬軍人復員，有九百萬人已找到工作，一百五十萬人入大學讀書。現失業依政府津貼爲生者僅五十餘萬人。至以整個美國而論，全國失業者不足二百萬人。若以美國資本主義發達而論，應該產生社會革命，實際上社會主義在美國最不流行。美國一萬萬四千萬人中，共產黨員不足十萬人，勞工協會與工業組織聯合會兩大工人團體，均反對共產主義。由於美國工人待遇很高，一個熟練工人平均每月有六百餘美金收入，普通工人每月亦有二百餘美金，生活旣安定，對於現狀之不滿自然减少。因此國會參眾兩院議員中竟無一共產黨員。</p>
<p>浪費物資道德墮落</p>
<p>社會問題：A物資的浪費，當巴黎倫敦鬧着缺煤的時候，而美國每家都燒水汀，溫度在八十度以上。今年美國南部的坎薩斯洲馬鈴薯收成很好，因爲太多了，怕馬鈴薯價下跌，將大批馬鈴薯澆上煤油焚燒。而歐洲許多國家正鬧着　　，B道德墮落，犯罪人數增加，三對夫婦中平均有一對離婚，兒童犯罪數目增加，本年六月間威斯康辛洲有一十六歲兒童殺死同伴四人。七月間加里羅尼亞洲有一十七歲少女竟與其愛人同謀殺死自己父母。　世界政策及中美關係，美國在第一次世界大戰後是採取孤立政策，第二次世界大戰後，其政策完全相反，就連一向主張孤立最烈的范登堡也改變作風。對於聯合國非常　護，對世界各國的動向非常開心。至以中美關係而論，在歷史上中美關係最好，因爲美國地大物博，無領土野心，與中國的立國精神相同。由於兩國的政策不衝突，不獨過去是很好的朋友，將來永遠一定是很好的朋友。如抗戰期間美國對中國的帮助，珍珠港事件後且成爲同盟國家，勝利後協助巾國空遝接收，這些都是彰明的事實。後來雖由共黨在美的宣傳，曁美國來華記者由於生活困苦而發生不滿之詞，致使美國援華能度趨於冷淡，以致中美友誼之間發生了一點小小的誤會，可是世界大勢所趨與美國的需要，促其改變袖手旁觀的政策，而趨於積極。最近如蒲立德「訪華觀感」的發表，和馬歇爾將要來國會撥款三億美元援華，這說明了美國對無政策將有改變。反之，我們需要人家援助，也必定要肅淸貪汚，樹立廉潔風氣，增進工作效率，所謂天助自助是也」。</p>
<h3>「中靑少年民主共和實騐國」宣告誕生舉行首屆議員選舉</h3>
<p>中國靑年會主辦，具有公民敎育意義之少年自治團體－「中靑少年民主共和實騐國，」籌備年餘，已於昨日在滬宣告誕生，同時舉行第一屆國會議員選舉，此一擁有國民九一三人之共和國，無疑爲世界最小亦最民主國家。</p>
<p>昨日隆重而熟烈之共和國成立大會，係於下午二時在四川路靑年會舉行，主席台前懸掛紅底藍三角，中綴白色梅花十朶之國旗，共和國數百公民無不洋溢歡欣，靜候此最小國家之誕生，靑年會負責人多人，曾以來賓資格，首先致懇摯之賀意，熱望此具體而微之國家組織，能帮助少年充分明瞭民主之眞諦，並有利於推進民主敎育。陸梅僧發言時，指摘社會上只知有家庭個人之錯誤觀念，故盼少年國之公民應愼於投票，使當選之議員均能爲國家社會做事，渠並盼墓少年們以民主政治之實踐經驗，向其親友廣爲宣傳，使社會人士對民主政治增進認識。陸幹臣以總理「以建民國，以進大同」爲勗。並提示民主政治下人民應注意三點：　有尊重別人之價值與人格之態度，　有不以役人爲榮而以役於人爲恥之精神，　有「成德達才」之資格。田耕莘則認爲共和國之目的，在培養人才，爲公眾服務，養成基督人格及社會並實行民主敎育。</p>
<p>全體公民旋合唱共和國國歌，並即舉行國會議員競選人四十六人，每人三分鐘之競選演說，隨即開始投票，公民每人有選舉票廿張，分投於所擁護之廿個議員之票櫃，共和國之國民規定爲年在十二至十八歲之靑年會會員，人數雖有九百餘人，但有選舉權之公民僅三百十餘人，故秩序井然，歷一時許完畢。當選之二十個議員將擇日召開第一屆國會，推選九人組織中央行政委員會，並互選正副主席各一人，及內政，外交，財政，司法，實業，教育，社會七部部長，並召開國民大會，通過憲法，新政府並決定明年元且宜告成立。</p>

<h3>蘇北三千里　民衆的心曲</h3>
<p>「本報淮陰七日訊」記者此度隨淮海綏靖區綏靖工作視察團出發蘇北各縣視察，以二十日之極短時間，歷經淮，淮，高，寳，興，泰，東，鹽，漣，泗，宿，睢，海，灌及連雲等十五縣市，往返三千餘里，征途勞頓，風塵僕僕，加以舊符未靖，車乘所之，輒以作戰準備出之，以待萬一，倘能將蕴積於我千數百萬蘇北同胞內心之苦悶，傾訴於讀者之前，則於願足矣！</p>
<p>儘管在蘇北這一塊廣大肥沃的平原上，還有一個很大的「面」在匪軍的控制或流竄下，儘管在他們所控制的地區中，用盡他們種種的誘惑手腕或者是不擇手段的恐怖政策，來勾引，壓迫民衆投入他們的羅網，可是這些卑鄙和殘暴的措施，阻當不了民衆傾向政府的心，更破壊不了民衆們對政府的擁護。</p>
<p>在共匪的鬥爭運動，已經越過了地主，中小資產階級的範圍，而擴展到以無產階級爲對象的今日，實在更足以加强民衆的信念：政府的懷抱是溫暖的，同時，爲了國家，爲了民族，也爲了自己，只有拿出所有的力量出來，向着戡亂建國的最高目標而奮鬥「可愛的蘇北民衆已經把他們所能拿出來的力量，全部拿出來了　」這是前江蘇第六區專員張逎藩（現任第七區專員）對記者講的話，這裏，我可以寫出一點事實來證明它。</p>
<p>一件長衫的來歷</p>
<p>在鹽城沒有淪陷前，那裏的中小學敎師，從收復後開始授課，直到國軍撤退的前夕，始終沒有領到一文薪金或其他津貼，枵腹從公，在鹽城爲敎育而敎育的敎育界中，已經發揮出了它的這一種尊嚴而神聖的精神。一位敎員曾經慘痛地說了這一段話：「幸虧蘇寗分署發了一件長衫給我，否則我就沒有長衫到敎室中上課，而丟去了「人師」的外表了。」</p>
<p>在蘇北，鹽城是一個最不幸運的城市，可算從收復以後，一直處在對外隔絕的狀態下。於是以鹽城人爲主體的太倉漁民自衛隊，爲了他們的家鄉，在幾個月以前，他們組織了一個突擊隊，由海上進入新洋港，向匪的後方突擊，他們已快打到鹽城的城郊了，後來軍事當局因爲恐怕策應不上，乃勸他們暫時退回。這一次，在戰略上說，雖然幷沒有收到很大的效果，可是已經給了匪軍一個　重的敎訓，民衆的力量是無窮的</p>
<p>馬玉洪設計炸匪</p>
<p>綏區高懐玉參謀，他吿訢我一個富有戲劇性的故事。淮安縣第十一區席橋鄕自衛隊馬玉洪，於本年八月十八日，宿於友人董某家中，夜間突來匪三十多人，携有長短槍二十餘支，由匪幹顏太發率領，衝入董宅內把馬玉洪捕獲，幷準備隨時槍決。馬玉洪情急智生，乃向匪宣稱，屋內尙藏有步槍兩枝，匪乃入內搜索，馬玉洪乘機取去手榴彈向匪羣摔去，當場炸斃匪區長，聯防主任，村長三人，馬乃越牆逸出，這是一個血和淚交織成的故事。蘇北的民衆，在嚐盡了奸匪的種種兇惡手段以後，就早已下了匪我不並存的決心了。</p>
<p>大人對小孩流淚</p>
<p>當蘇北沒有全面光復前，灌雲和東海是蘇北東北角的一個孤島。那時在匪軍的重圍之下，灌雲縣已經形成了食糧吿盡的局面，大家除了在饑餓綫上掙扎而外，還要拿血和肉來抵禦匪軍的襲擊。在這個環境中，就時常可以看到大人對着小孩子們流淚的鏡頭。爲什麼流淚？因爲大人們看到孩子們枯黃的面孔，覺得這些小生靈們在這個悲慘的時代中和著大眾一樣地受著無比的磨折，實在太悽慘了，所以記者化灌雲，碰到任何一個人，都是認爲月前的環境雖然惡劣，但是能在千磨萬折之餘，重新獲得了自由，已經是够幸福的了。（特派記者凌松壽）</p>

<h3>全市小學運動會揭幕　小英雄爭奇鬭勝團體操五花八門　田賽三項決賽成績尙稱優良</h3>
<p>「本報訊」本市第五屆全市運動會，及第十一屆小學聯合運動會，昨在中正公園合併隆重揭幕。到各學校計一百餘單位二萬一千人，各機關代表及觀衆約萬餘人，盛况空前。儀式於十時正開始舉行，首由新生國民學校樂隊領導大會職員，各校校旗，全體運動員等繞會塲一週後，奏樂升旗，並放信鴿百隻，高翔雲空，與一百二十三面之各校校旗相掩映，燦爛莊嚴，極爲壯麗。開會後先由會長李熙謀報吿開會意義，及籌備此次運動會之經過，繼由市府沈秘書長，嚴監察使，市黨部曹副主委，聖約翰大學敎授傅統先相繼致詞，勗勉備至。吳市長及潘議長亦於十一時許趕到，在一片掌聲中簡略致詞，希望各運動員努力銀鍊德智體育，將來貢獻國家。詞畢即舉行大會操，參加曾操之男女學生計一萬一千人，由王懐琪等領導發佈口令，全體學生制服整齊，動作敏捷，極爲壯觀。</p>

<h3>會塲花絮</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕市運會昨天在中正公園揭幕，正値總理誕辰，各機關休假，中正公園內外，擠得水洩不通。</p>
<p>像是一副古戰塲的局而：中正公園內由晨迄晚，號角聲聲，金鼓隆隆，旗幟翻騰，門開八面（會塲中設有東，南，西，北，及東南，東北，西南，西北八門），再加上塲週遍佈的一百餘座蓬帳，儼然殺氣騰勝，使人有身臨大敵之感。</p>
<p>爭先恐後</p>
<p>在各學校的蓬帳當中，本報的一頂大型蓬帳最受觀衆注目，蓬頂上面硃筆楷書的「申報」兩個大字，更吸引了無數觀衆爭先恐後來問消息，抄紀錄，讀壁報，本報的蓬帳遂成了一個臨時的會塲服務處和間訊站</p>
<p>因爲主持慶祝總理誕辰紀念會，吳市長和潘議長於十一時一刻始趕到會塲，在一片堂聲中，吳市長很感動地說：「中年人看到年靑的一代，心頭總　有無限的興奮。擔負艱鉅，中年人至多再有二十年的時間，而靑年人的希望則是無窮盡的。今天看到會塲中活躍着的下一代的朝氣，使我彷彿看到了，未來中國的前途。」語重心長，學生們深深感動。</p>
<p>大會揭幕前，信鴿高翔，因事前節目單中未及排入此項節目，故各報攝影記者均落去此一鏡頭。升旗時，又因旗手過度緊張，國旗未能展開，纏繞繩上，攝影記者又多以未能攝得一雄偉飄揭之升旗鏡頭爲憾。</p>
<p>水塘處處</p>
<p>會塲中最惱人的，是大小便解決的困難，許多小學生因爲這覓便所不得，急中生智，就拉了幾個同學　成一圈，輪流在圈中解決，以致會塲週圍，頻添了不少水塘，和一堆堆的　丘。</p>
<p>團體操的表演，確實是勾心鬥角，各校無論在服裝上，動作上，都自關蹊徑，生面別開，所以會塲中五光十色，很是動人。一個學生家長看到自己的孩子穿着花團錦簇的制服，在職欣鼓舞表演的時候，忽然長嘆一聲道：「阿囝上星期吵着要做這套衣服，不答應他，幾次哭喪着臉，連飯都不要吃呢！」</p>
<p>表演中以東明分校的小木匠舞，延平路國民小學的水手舞，飛虹的掃帝舞，　春的漿旗操，比德分校的巾舞，最爲精彩，這些學生大都是十歲以下的孩子，最幼小的還不滿五歲。俯仰進退，若合符節，全塲觀衆，一致讀許。</p>
<p>兩小無猜</p>
<p>東明幼稚生表演「小綿羊舞」時，攝影記者都忙着覓取這些兩小無猜的孩子們的鏡頭，一個老祖母樣子的婦人在旁邊笑逐顏開的說：「囡囡舞　得眞好，請你們替他拍一張照片吧！明天活潑伶俐地登在報上。」</p>
<p>大會主席台上陳列的獎品，計有銀盾十五只，銀杯廿二只，及鏡框錦屛等很多。銀盾銀杯大部分均係銀行界所贈，中國·中央·中匯·國華·大陸·金城·綢業·至中等各銀行的杯盾，都是極精緻而又富有誘惑性的，選手們從台前走過，不約而同的在行注目禮。</p>
<p>中正公園裏面，昨天應運而興的臨時攤販，至少在四十處以上。有一處「西洋鏡」的攤販，給小朋友們團團圍住，險些兒擠翱西洋鏡攤，把西洋鏡拆穿了！</p>

<h3>逸園球友誼賽東華白鷹成和局</h3>
<p>足球友誼賽昨日下午三時東華與白鷹兩隊角逐於逸園球塲，秋高氣爽，又値國父誕辰紀念休假，慕名作壁上觀者尙稱衆多，較上週對靑白之戰爲盛。角逐結果上半時白鷹以二比〇領先，休息後，東華反攻，扳成平手，結果各二和局終塲。昨賽雙方出塲陣容如下：</p>

<h3>閩莆田田徑隊今晨抵達本市</h3>
<p>福建莆田男女田徑隊上海遠征軍，自本月九日由福州搭乘新康論啓程後，原定昨日可抵埠，奈洋面風浪過大，致原定時間未克到達。昨晚記者向海關方面探詢結果，該新康輪已於昨晚九時許抵達吳淞口外洋面，因格於港口規定，故將於今晨八時進口，停泊楊家渡第十二　　筒，本市九九及益社兩田徑隊，定今晨往碼頭歡迎云。</p>
<h3>足球甲組聯賽全部秩序排定</h3>
<p>體協足球委員會主辦之第三屆上海足球聯賽，除乙丙組業於上月下旬揭幕外，甲組賽則因馬來亞聯華征滬，及接受明年世運華中華北區足球選拔試賽等關係，經該委員會第五次委員會議決議，甲組賽改用單循環制，於十一月廿九卅日開始舉行，所有原排秩序亦予取消。昨日上午十時該會召集參加甲組賽各隊代表，於足委會主席容啓兆，裁判會會長譚毅監視下，重行抽　，排定秩序如下：</p>

<h3>美國援華借款實現以後　本市物價即可改觀　國內工業處境或不免困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金融界責任人士談：在目前局勢之下，美國勢必援歐援華，故借款之來，勢所必然。惟我國獲得借款後，更需簡約簡流，將其使用於最有利之途徑。美政府人員對經濟援華，有其舉重若輕之看法，認為中國所缺乏之主要物資，如糧食藥品布疋等，美國均能獨立供應；而此數項物資價格穩定後，物價問題已大致解決。華府目前所考慮者，為援華究須多少代價，並據此擬定一通盤之計劃。美國經濟援助必採取物資運華之方式，而以食糧藥品衣料為主體，此事一旦有莫大帮助；但在另一方面，借款肖有其交換條件。將來美貨之暢銷我國市塲，亦屬勢所必至。特別在藥品方面，過去美德瑞士爭雄我國市塲，今則美國巳接收德國之生產，其勢力之雄厚，不言可喻。目前美國疋在熱心訓練我國之醫務人員，授以使用美藥之訓練，一方面周為善意協助，但亦附帶為本國之工商等服務。舉此一端，可概括其餘。未來我國工業之處摬，不免感受困難。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕外匯平凖委員會負責人頃對美政府擬以三億元貸華事，發表意見稱：美政府旣欲貸款中國，對其用途必有一確定之計劃，此事權在美國，不便有所批證。因華府實播過於簡短，貨款之條件不得而知，惟將來在國會中必有冗長熱烈之辯論，內容自將大白。所可言者，每月二千萬美元之協助，對我國經濟有相當裨益。自馬爾談話發表後，金鈔黑市即吿下跌，可見春作用之一斑。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市民意機關某負責人對美貸發表意見，略謂：此事我國朝野期望已久，今美政府能正式向國會提出，自為可喜之事。在外匯頭寸奇缺之今日，每月如能有二千萬美元之補助，裨益至大。本人相信此筆貸款將協助我國之經濟建設，而並非全部以日用品方式援華。同時貸款一旦成立，對物價將有重大影響。</p>
<h3>首批美國粉麥月內即可啟運　共約二萬八千噸</h3>
<p>中美救濟協定中糧食部份，首批巳核准者為小麥一萬七千噸，麺粉一萬一千噸，並擬於月肉啓運，年內抵華。茲悉：美領事署連日與中央信託局商討結果，美方贊同中信局在美預先組設接收機構，並承辦運輸事宜。</p>
<p>又悉：小麥部份可能交由本市各麺粉廠加工代磨，按原料與成品為七對三比例計算，將來可得洋粉一萬一千九百噸云。</p>
<h3>營利及自由職業　申請登記辦法</h3>
<p>財政部以利和稅法實行細則第六條第七條條文，業經奉准條正，並通令各直接稅局在案。根據該項修正文之規定，凡營利事業及自由職業者之業務所，均應向當地主管直接稅征收機關申請登記。前頒之「所得稅納行住商申請登記辦法」應予修正以期符合。茲經本部製定「營利事業及自由職業者之業務所申請登記辦法」一份，並將「所得稅納稅行住商申請登記辦法」予以廢止。茲誌「營利事業及自由職業者之業務申請登記辦法」要點如次：　凡新開業改組合併頂盤後另立或存續之營利事業，應於開始營業後一個月內，向當地主管征收機關申請登記，發給甲種所得稅登記證。　凡自由職業之業務所，應於開始營業一個月內，向當地主管征收機關申請登記，發給乙種所得稅登記證。　凡現在營業　執行業務之營利事業，或自由職業去向不明之業務所，於本辦法公布日起一個月內，一律依本辦法規定辦理登記。</p>
<h3>市商會電請立法院考慮核减牌照稅率</h3>
<p>市商會頃電立法院，略謂據本市汽車運貨商業同業公會等函稱，頃閱報載立法院修正通過使用牌照稅法，關於稅論一項，絞之三十五年十二月四日之稅法所定者，增加達三十倍以上。此種增稅倍數，為素來所未有。查運輸商於抗戰期間，創鉅痛深，至今元氣未復，平時繳納各項捐稅，己覺負荷綦重，力有勿勝，値此業務凋敝，處境艱危之現在，早感維持為難，何堪再增稅負。本會為全體會員生存計，萬難緘默，用敢迫切陳詞，敬請貴會迅予轉呈立法院察核下情，准賜對使用牌照稅之修正稅率，重予考慮核减，以示禮恤而免艱困，曷勝企盼之至，等語到會。計荷鑒及，茲據該公會函請前情，竊謂上述稅率，較現行稅法增加至三十倍以上，負担憑鉅，春結果仍為消費者輾轉循環，必至三十倍不止，本會認為關係民生問題實太嚴重，仍請鈞院按照本會西養西梗兩代重及此電呈各節，重行考慮核减，以輕民衆負担。</p>
<h3>中信推進春絲外銷　希望各絲廠迅速交貨</h3>
<p>中央信託局辦理收購春絲工作，經各廠商陸續交到者，截至目前為止，共四，〇九七包（每包含量一三三磅又三分之一）。內A級一〇五包，B級七五五包，C級一，三〇五包，D級一三〇〇包，E級五六〇包，又十六十八條紋者計一七包，十三十五條紋者二五包，組絲三〇包。為爭取外匯，經該局陸續向國外運銷者，計二，四六〇包。內A級七〇包，B級二九五包，C級八四〇包，D級九五〇包，E級三〇五包。輸入國另以美印居多，約各佔百分之四十，餘屬歐陸等地。近日該局復向印度售出三〇〇包，待船啓運。此外並擬於月底前向美運出八〇〇包，蘇聯一，五〇〇包。按目前在手生絲，僅餘一，六三七包，若全部運出，不足之數為九六三包。中信局方面希望各廠迅速交貨，以備凖時運出云。</p>
<h3>台灣輕重工業進步迅速　糖廠即將全部開工　下年度台糖擬外銷十萬噸</h3>
<p>資源委員會主任秘書兼台灣糖業公司董事長吳兆洪氏，於過滬返京前談：此次赴台，曾召開公司第二次董監聯席會議，對於公司下年度工作計劃。及營業概算，均經確定。台灣糧業，經公司兩年來積極整理修復，原有糖廠三十六所，年底可全部開工製糖。種蔗面積，亦自三萬甲增至八萬九千甲，下年度更將增為十一萬八千甲。台灣農民因公司實行分糖法，利益甚厚，故種蔗極為踴躍。去年種蔗面積，已達原定計劃。每甲施肥數　，亦自八十公斤逐漸增至四百公斤左右。倉庫面積，本年內新建達二十萬方之多。本年製糧季節，下月即將開始。預計本季產量，可達三十萬公噸。目前日本朝鮮南洋及中東各地。均需糖甚切，為爭取外匯起見，已與中央銀行商定增加輸出辦法，預計下年擬外銷十萬噸。現在英國正在倡導饑餓輸出，食糖雖非人生日用必不可少之物品，惟我國所產台糖，品質極佳。吾人為整個國家經濟打算，應儘量簡約消費，增加外銷數量，以期增益外匯收入云。</p>
<p>資源委員會主任委員翁文灝等一行，日前自台北搭機來滬。據翁氏表示，此次在台考察結果，頗為滿意。一切輕重工業均有長足進步，如糖，上季產量為三萬餘噸，下季可增至卅餘萬噸。羅東紙廠去年製紙四十萬噸，本年已增至一百十萬噸。此外如水泥·　·肥料·均在大量增產中。且尙有若干新產品，如汽車·柴·油·剎車油等，戰前均無此出品。</p>
<h3>豬鬃業向農行借款·初步業已獲致成功</h3>
<p>本市豬鬃業公會，為謀本年度毛貨大量蒐集，以資維持起見，曾召開會議，分區徵集現貨，以便向農民銀行押款。現據該會理事費梅生氏吿稱，押款進行經過頗形順利，並已獲致初步成功。費氏又稱，此次押款，對於本業固可利有此項押款，在產地大量收購毛貨，同時對於國際市塲，亦可經常維持出口，而無斷絕之慮云。</p>
<h3>輸日食鹽减少改用鐵砂補充</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：自海南島所產鐵砂，輸日易取機車後，經濟部已命廣州工商輔導處，詳細調查廣東各鋼鐵廠原料之供需情形，以便斟酌情形，儘先以原料供給本國廠家，而以　餘外銷。按前次政府決定鐵砂輸日時，主要有兩：　此項鐵砂我日前尙不感需要，　中日易貨交易，日本所需者為積食及煤鐵原料，糧食及煤我國均自給不足，過去輸日之食　為大宗，因局勢關係為數銳减，輸日量僅有原契約十一之數，故不得巳改以鐵紗輸出。</p>
<h3>江西瓷器　擬向美國推銷</h3>
<p>江西瓷器，昔時聞名世界。近因掖術不見改進，以致營業日衰。現有大利進出口行與江西瓷業界頗有聯絡，擬推銷西菜瓷器至南北美。惟鑒過去此項市塲為日本所推斷，為防日瓷復興傾銷，將託工商輔導處調查日本瓷業情形。此外江西各銀行不營外匯業務，信用證祇能開至上海。滬贛匯水甚高，（現為百分之六）成本旣增，手續又繁。日出口貸款期限，近忽由九十天縮為三十天，而瓷器製造窑時二月，贛滬運輸亦須一月，故貸款不能充分運用，希望主管機關速謀補救云。</p>
<h3>捲烟肥皂均跌</h3>
<p>昨晨捲烟市况，以各方人心虛怯，更因銀根抽緊，塲內拋售不絕。年收十支大英烟，比上日　　卅　，老刀哈德門均低廿五萬元，英商烟美　　　銀行等，每條跟跌五百至千元。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂方面，因多頭吐售了結，且有六批拋賣，價較廠盤為低，而走銷只有各星四口。故結果固本皂，比上日每箱再跌一萬，箭刀挫六千元，其他各皂平定。雞牌洋燭盤小二萬，火柴亦多微降。</p>
<h3>茶葉輸出業公會　定期召開大會　討論茶葉輸出步驟</h3>
<p>上海市茶葉輸出葉公會，以自政府開放外匯以來，將近兩年，出口業之不振，以茶葉輸出困難更甚。雖因品質未能儘量改良，但其他運輸交通，資金調劑，成本高昂等種種因素影響茶葉輸出，確為重大癥結。現値政府策劃國際收支平衡，茲屬出口貿易之際，我國茶葉特產為主要輸出之一，為改進茶葉輸出步驟，及配合政府輸出貿易政策起見，定於本月十八日假市商會舉行會員大會，討論推茶葉輸出事宜云。</p>
<h3>本年世界米產展望　較上年略增較戰前平均尙少</h3>
<p>據美國農部初步偕計，一九四七年至四八年度世界產米量，約為六九五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾，較上年度略增，但較戰前平均產量尙少百分之七。北美洲，歐洲，非州及亞洲除印度半島外，米產希望均轉佳。南美洲米產若干，因時間關係，未能估計，大約不致少於上年度。</p>
<p>中國，日本，菲律濱，朝鮮與馬來之稻田，均見增加，且收刈前之天氣，利於米產。暹羅，緬甸與越南三個食米剩餘國家之總產量，料將較上年度增加一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾。</p>
<p>緬甸植稻區巳增面萬畝，惟八月間洪水為患，稻田大受損害，暹羅米產，於移植時期苦旱，阻碍其最高限度之復原，惟米產仍有視去歲增加之望。越南方面，因情况不定，本年米產料將减少。</p>
<p>印度半島有稻田八〇，五〇〇，〇〇〇畝，預料一九四七年至四八年間產米約為一，九八〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾。上年度八一，八〇〇，〇〇〇畝，則產二，一〇五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾，因本年植麻者增多，致稻田畝及產量均減少。</p>
<p>馱子料本年米產增加量為：北美洲六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾，歐洲七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾，非洲二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布什爾。上述布什爾數字，均係糙米，並非白米。</p>

<p>民衆敎育之於新中國的建設，是何等的重要！可是在荒蕪的出版界裏，要想找一本能指出民衆敎育的動向，說明民衆敎育的正確途徑的著作，委實難極。最近我們欣幸地拜讀到了古楳氏所著的民衆敎育新動向。</p>
<p>民衆敎育在中國，已有幾十年的歷史，討論民衆敎育問題的書報，也出版了不少，比較著名的有甘豫源編的民衆敎育（中華），孟憲承編的民衆敎育（世界版），趙步霞編的民衆敎育綱要（中華），高踐四編的民衆敎育（商務），陳禮江編的民衆敎育（商務），兪慶棠編的民衆敎育（正中）：這些著作，對於中國的民敎發展上，不無貢獻之處。但是中國經過了八年抗戰，中國民衆，特別是勞苦大衆，遭受了空前的厄運，民衆敎育必須變換努力的方向以肩負建國的使命，該是很淸楚的事。</p>
<p>著者古先生從事民衆敎育近二十年，對於民衆敎育確有深刻的認識與研究，素爲民衆敎育工作同志所欽佩的。這本著作，先從民衆敎育發展的過程，觀察其動向，次列舉谷種實施辦法，並批判其得失，使研究或辦理民衆敎育者知所取捨。誠如自序中所說：「　本書從民衆敎育發展的過程來敘述，籍此可以明瞭它前後的轉變；　轉變是有主觀和客觀的條件限制着並非完全憑空而至的；　辦理民衆教育人員，必須深切認識這些條件，然後才能把握得住，向前努力去幹，走上光明的大道。」</p>
<p>民衆敎育在中國，固然特別需要提倡，但是過去的民衆敎育，對於中國民衆有利抑有害，的確是很可熟慮的。古氏提醒民敎工作同志，注意實施民敎主觀的和客觀的條件，尤見其語重心長，深致欽佩！</p>
<p>全書共七章：　民衆敎育是什麽？　民衆敎育的內容，　民衆補習敎育，　綜合的民衆敎育，　分立的民衆敎育，　民衆敎育的新發展，　民衆敎育向那裏動。</p>
<p>從這些內容看來，這書已具備了民衆敎育的完備的體系。作者推崇這書，因爲它具有下面的優點：</p>
<p>具有深刻獨到的見解，特別是以民敎發展的過程來指出民敎的動向，沒有一點偏見，尤覺難能可貴，譬如說古先生指出各家對於民衆敎育的解釋，各有不同的緣故，是忽略了發展的過程及條件的限制的緣故，所以著者在民衆敎育的意義一節裏說：「民衆敎育在現階段，是發展人民大衆生活的敎育，』這樣用辯證的方法來解釋民衆敎育的意義，是何等的適當，中肯。</p>
<p>準對現實，立論不尙虛飾：古先生是一位樸實的學者。立論素具根據，旣無虛構之處，更無過激偏見之弊。譬如說，古先生在民敎的對象一節裏說：「一般人以爲中國民衆敎育的對象是全民，無條件的說無論男女，職業，貧富，貴賤，受敎育與未受敎育，上自全國領袖，下至販夫走卒」都是民衆敎育的對象，實不免描寫得過分其事，太冠免堂皇。」而古先生却指出中國現階段的民敎對象，應以一切勞苦大衆，尤其是成年的勞苦大衆爲對象，是何等切合實際的話。</p>
<p>章末有研究和討論問題，而這些問題又都能發人深思，可使讀者對於該章內容有更深刻的了解，而對於民敎工作者，尤指示了努力的方向。</p>
<p>從自序中知道，這書是抗戰以後作者在生活最難困的那些歲月中寫成的。那時，作者困居上海，（當時稱爲孤島）生活之苦，不堪想像，而古先生尤能於敎課之暇，從事本書的撰著，尤覺其珍貴。在文章中不時流露出消極悲觀的論調，可見當時作者的心情，是何等的惡劣，處境又是何等的悲慘！唯其本書是危難中的產兒，更覺其偉大！</p>
<h3>數學趣味中</h3>
<p>— 中浣</p>
<p>劉壎字著　開明版</p>
<p>高等代數，最普通的敎科書是范氏大代數，最好的參考書是霍乃二氏高等代數學，和上野淸氏的大代數學講義。范氏編制適宜，而霍乃二氏和大代數講義二書則以習題見長。這裏所要介紹的「數學趣味」的特長是「說理明白」，作者劉壎宇先生用流利輕鬆的筆調，用淺顯的理論，來說明高深的理論，而以日常生活中的事物作爲根據，不比一般數學書的枯燥無味。</p>
<p>本書的內容大致和霍乃二氏相同，包括排列組合，不定方程式之解法，積彈問題，高級等差級數，記數法等。取材新穎，譬如論積彈問題則由賣湯細說起，論或然率則由搓麻將說起，自然而然地引起興趣，使人集中注意力。是一本好的參考書，也是一本有益的小說。</p>
<p>至於應用方面，我認爲應當和霍乃二氏合在一起用，因爲霍乃二氏似乎太深，至今沒有好的譯本，所以理論方面，我們用「數學趣味」以補霍乃二氏之不足，但是「數學趣味」沒有習題，還得靠霍乃二氏帮忙，這樣才可以相得益彰。</p>
<p>本書價錢不高，一樣厚薄的一本小說，也許比牠貴，所以我勸高中學生大可買一本旣可以作參考書又可作小說。</p>
<h3>原子能與人生</h3>
<p>— 林厚綸</p>
<p>（G·Gamow著，陳忠杰舒重則合譯，「原子能與宇宙及人生」，商務發行，價一萬五千元。）</p>
<p>勝利以來，各書局所出的新書，不可謂不多矣，然而像「原子能與宇宙及人生」這樣的通俗科學小書，倒似乎十分少見。這裏，吾人不得不讚嘆商務印書館當局的卓見，和兩位譯者的努力。由於他們的犧牲，才使國人獲得一個眞正增長智識的良好機會。</p>
<p>G·Gamow是美國華盛頓大學的教授，美國軍部中研究原子能的一個重要任務，對於解放原子能的理論和技術，都有車大的貢獻，以他研究得到的知識，來寫這本小書，實在是太「大才小用」了唯其如此，也成為了全書最大的遺憾：這本書還不能成為一本「人人能了解的通俗科學書」，書中不免有許多地方，是太深奧了一點。流利的釋筆，雖然補救了一些，但仍需除去幾頁深奧的敘述，才可算是一本大家能懂的通俗科學書。</p>
<p>書中有幾幅插圖和照片，都十分有趣而意義深長。尤其是第一幅照片，更有偉大的寓意，原子能悄悄的被人知道，不到五十年，就轟轟烈烈的大展雄扌，一舉而澈底毀壊了一座大城。五十年中，物理請學的進步，是如何的令人驚異。</p>
<p>然而書中值得稱道的，並不止一些照片和一些插圖，本書給高中學生用作參考書，可算是十分得當的。崁近，各校高中課程中，很多地方需要講解原子構造，在那些高深而艱晦的文字中，要想具體的去了解原子構造和形狀，實在是相當的困難　再要從而去了解何以能够解放原子中內含的能，那自然是更加困難了。然而在本聲中，却獨特的，用一粒水滴的面能來解釋，旣具體，又易了解，眞比敎科書中的講解，明白得萬倍了。</p>
<p>G·Gamow敎授講完了原子構造的比喩，和解放原子能的原理後，就來了一段海角天涯的叙述，來寫成本書的第二章。本章中講出我們人的來源，地球的來源，太陽如何產生，太陽系所寄托的銀河，銀河以外的星雲，乃至是雲以外的那片大地方，和小小的原子又有何關係。原文的敘述，是那麽優美，而譯文的表達，更充滿了文藝氣息。這一章大約要算是全書中最吸引讀者的部份了。人的來源，地球的來源…………這一串問題，是人人想知道的事，而本書竟能寫成人人能了解的文字。對於純學術上，雖無多大貢獻，而於普及科學，和提起人們對科學的與趣兩點而言，是十分有價值。</p>
<p>原子與宇宙的關係講過以後，就來談原子能與人生了。這個問題成書中的第三章　第三章的前一半，是十分專門而不當，我國普通中學生是不能了解的，而理工科大學生又已經了解，只有該章的最後一節，似乎還可算是具有普遍興趣。其中吿訴吾人許多原子能的用處，和將來的展望</p>
<h3>居禮夫人傳</h3>
<p>— 陳正人著　世界書局出版</p>
<p>鐳是世界上最神秘而稀罕的東西。鐳的發現人，就是波蘭女科學家居禮夫人。我想這個名字大家是很熟悉的，本書是叙述居禮夫人生平的事蹟。</p>
<p>全書共分廿八章：第一章是講波蘭亡國恨那時波蘭國家是在俄國勢力範圍以下。第二章是介紹放射性原素。第三章是講她幼年時代，她的父親是一個敎書先生，她有三個姐姐和一個哥哥。從第四章至第八章是她求學時代，「在這一班中瑪麗（居禮夫人以前的名字）的年紀是最小，可是各種功課，她總名列前茅，爲同級學生的冠軍」。可見她當時很聰明和用功。中學之後，她家因經濟困難，沒有進大學。做了幾年家庭教師。徐來由她三姐的帮助，才到巴黎去讀大學。第十章以後是講她和居禮先生結婚以後，提取純　的經過，起先她們的經濟很困難，沒有錢去買原料，以廠棚爲試驗室。她們發現　以後，得樂幾次獎金，便漸漸的出名了。後來居禮先生逝世以後，她任了女教授。美國送她二克鐳，她拿一克贈予法國，一克贈于她的祖國。後來她的身體因勞苦所致而漸漸衰弱。六十七歲的一年（一九三四年）七月四日在桑色勒逝世。</p>
<p>最後一章是結語。愛因斯坦說「在所有名人中，唯一不爲盛名所　倒的，只有居禮夫人」。居禮夫人的奪門，勤苦的工作，而獲了最後的結果，得着極大的勞譽。但她自己一些也不驕傲，她是爲工作而工作的！</p>
<h3>「詩的藝術」</h3>
<p>— 胡積德</p>
<p>李廣田著　開明書店出版　　「詩的藝術」與艾靑的「詩論」，在新詩壇上，可說是兩部比較完美的論著。前者理論與批評參半，後者完全着重於理論方面。此爲二書不同之處。</p>
<p>「詩的藝術」書中各文，不是分章與節或有體系性的，道兒收集的有五篇文章，均爲前前後後寫成的。「詩的藝術」也就是其中的一篇，並作爲書名。現在將此書的特點略述於左，以介紹與年靑而愛好新詩的續者們。（正如著者云云「年靑而有熱情的人，都是一首詩。年靑的人用詩來發洩情感是最衛生的。」那麽就讓我們去賞鑑這詩的藝術吧！）</p>
<p>新詩散文化的剖析：從新文化運動以來，新詩從舊的受束縛與限制的軀發中。解放了出來。照理說，新時代的開始。每每是詩花怒放的日子。德國的哥德，許雷的例子，是大家熟知的。法國在大革命時代，產生出不少偉大的大詩人，也就是這個理由。可是，我們中國新詩的途徑，還在荆棘　中開發。著者在第一篇中指示出現在的詩，是散文化的詩，還沒有跨進理想的境域，不過，從有那麼多的讀者愛護下，將來的發展還是可樂觀的，並在文中提及有：「在過去，書店老板看見新詩便搖頭，而現在，商人的算盤上這一筆也打得頗響亮。」新詩沒有進入優越性的階段，著者在署中剖析甚詳，讓我在這兒摘下幾句：「針對了目前這一詩散文化的風氣，我們只是說，詩人人無常自己去創造（或利用（各種不同的形式，不要忽略了形式，爲了要盡善盡美地去傳達那些稱得起詩的思想，感情，或「完整的經驗」，並去提高它們。」</p>
<p>形式與內容的硏討：詩成爲散文化，於是就牽連到形式與內容問題去。他（以下均指著者自己）說：「我相信「內容決定形式」，因此，也相信內容對於形式所具有優越性。」「講求形式，並不是忽略內容，而是要提高內容。」他在第二篇中，以批評下至琳的「十年詩草」爲例，把章法，句法。格式。　法諸方面，加以硏討，對於讀者們決不是空泛理論的塗數，同樣的，也昭示了我們硏究新詩的態度</p>
<p>用字批判的謹愼：「詩人的聲音，就是我們的聲音，時代的聲音。詩人替我們呼吸，替我們發聲又發光」那麼，詩旣然是代表人們的聲音，我們何必去「咬文嚼字」的推敲？這個問題我們可在書中尋到解答。「生活第一。藝術第二。只有那忠實於生活的人，纔能作爲藝術家，纔能忠實於藝術的。」詩在藝術的技巧，本質中，都有它的深度，所以不論是一字一語決不是馬虎的。從第四篇批評方敬的詩，在「呢」「嗎」「哪」的單字上，去說明調子的低高。顯然的，他對於用字的謹愼的硏究，都有獨到之處。此足以吿誡學習新詩的人的努力。</p>
<p>指示學習者的道路：在最後一篇中，他指示出學習新詩的年靑作者的道路，及其應糾正的缺點。學習的方法，以樹爲喩，「蕪亂，是一棵小樹的肆意生長；潔凈，是你把它修剪了一番，收東了一番；但這修剪，這收束，却正是爲了它將生長得更像樣子，它將有非常豐實的完成。」這就是指示出學習者寫詩不「潔凈」的毛病；並且吿每一位年靑的學習者，對「暴露狂」與「熱中」的毛病的禁忌。句句對症發藥，決不是對我們沒有裨益的。</p>

<h3>National Occupational Women's Election Office; Explains Meaning of "Preliminary Announcement"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the question of whether those listed in the candidate lists of the nationwide occupational women's organizations' election office's announcements on the 6th and 9th with the notation "Not yet fully reviewed, preliminary announcement" are confirmed as "qualified," a spokesperson for the office stated that the legally mandated "review" period after the candidate registration deadline is only five days. Given the current traffic and postal difficulties, the issuance and verification of signature documents are impractical within this short period. "Therefore, most lower-level election offices, in order to meet the announcement deadline, telegraphed names in advance, stating that signature documents would be mailed separately. These signature documents could not all be received by the office before the announcement period. The eighth election committee meeting of this office resolved that: Telegrams with a notation for verification would be announced; those without a notation would be preliminarily announced. Individual telegrams received before the final announcement period would be permitted for preliminary announcement." The "Not yet fully reviewed, preliminary announcement" notations on the two announcements of this office were made based on the above facts and in accordance with the resolution. As for whether candidates who have been preliminarily announced have obtained "qualified" status, the seventh committee meeting of this office resolved: "Those whose verification is inconsistent before the election will be canceled; those whose verification is inconsistent after the election will be declared invalid." According to the above, those who are still listed as preliminarily announced in the final supplementary announcement on the 15th of this month do not need to undergo further review and announcement procedures to be considered qualified candidates. This principle is very clear. However, this office will continue to actively verify at any time before the final announcement. All those who have been preliminarily announced, such as Ye Lufu and 21 others listed in Item A of the 9th announcement, are handled in this way. It is expected that by the date of the 15th final announcement, the list of those changed from preliminary announcement to announcement will certainly be even greater. However, it is possible that a portion will not be changed to announcement, but this will not affect their eligibility. Furthermore, the list of candidates for National Assembly delegates from national occupational and women's organizations nominated by the Chinese Kuomintang has been forwarded by the general election office to the national occupational and women's election office. After registration and review by the office, the 250 people, including Tang Chengzong, have passed and are now publicly announced in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Revised Distribution of National Assembly Delegate Quotas for Border Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The National Government issued an order on the 13th: Herewith the revised distribution of National Assembly delegate quotas for representatives of various ethnic groups elected in border regions is promulgated.

<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 12th] Regarding the quotas for Legislative Yuan members and National Assembly delegates from national industrial and mining sectors, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Chongqing municipalities should be allocated one Legislative Yuan member and three National Assembly delegates. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that Yunnan Province is one of the four major national defense industrial zones, so the one Legislative Yuan member from the western industrial and mining sector is designated to be elected by Yunnan, while the three National Assembly delegates will be elected by Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun Discusses United Nations Issues; Criticizes Uncooperative Attitude; Hopes to Rescue Crisis with Moderation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th] Ambassador Gu Weijun indirectly criticized the Soviet Union for adopting an uncooperative attitude in the United Nations General Assembly, causing the world to become two different and seemingly irreconcilable camps, at a banquet held by the Foreign Press Association here on the 11th, which was met with thunderous applause. Gu stated: The reason why the United Nations' efforts to seek peace have become difficult is that there are almost two worlds in everything that is most important to the future of mankind. He described these two separate worlds as follows: In the economic sphere, capitalism and communism look at each other with suspicion, each claiming that the other has no place to exist. One side of democracy is based on one-party dictatorship, where the opposition party has no right to vote, while the other side recognizes the people's freedom of election and often accepts the victory of the opposition party with a good attitude. One side of cooperation expresses at least a willingness to compromise with the other side, while the other side expects the other to completely obey its will, otherwise it will not cooperate. One side of peace hopes to make the world peaceful, restored, and prosperous by providing relief and assistance to post-war reconstruction, while the other side still holds suspicion and is indifferent to the delay and uncertainty in solving global problems. As to whether the above-mentioned differences will become a prelude to another world war, Gu quoted sophists as saying: "Those who want to instigate chaos cannot succeed, and those who can succeed do not want to do it." He also said that so far no one has put forward a compromise solution that can reconcile these two different concepts and be acceptable to people, so he advocated adopting a moderate approach to deal with future problems of the United Nations, that is, think from the worst, but do not abandon hope and efforts for the best result.</p>
<h3>United States Seeking Practical Ways to Help Improve China's Currency Difficulties; Marshall Continues to Explain Aid to China Stance</h3>
<p>[News Report] New York, 12th Broadcasting: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee and continued to explain the issue of foreign aid. He said: The State Department sincerely hopes to help China, and said that China's situation is different from that of Europe. The United States government hopes that this aid will be effective. Marshall continued: Europe needs emergency assistance to prevent the import of important goods from being interrupted, otherwise famine and industrial bankruptcy will occur. However, the problem in China is different. China's imports are not immediately threatened with interruption, and China has resources. He said that the problem of inflation is a difficulty for China and must be helped to improve it, and the Chinese government should also take some steps to prevent inflation. We are seeking practical ways to ensure that at least 70% of the aid we give to China is effective. I am proposing the issue of foreign aid to Congress based on this position.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall declared in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: In addition to the 2.597 billion US dollars for aid to Europe and occupation forces, he will ask Congress to allocate 60 million US dollars before July 1 next year to aid Europe and occupation forces. In addition to the 2.597 billion US dollars for aid to Europe and occupation forces, he will ask Congress to allocate 60 million US dollars before July 1 next year to aid China. Undersecretary of State Lovett said: If aid to China continues after June 30 next year, approximately 20 million US dollars will be needed each month. Official estimates that long-term aid to China by July 1, 1949, is more valuable to our goals than the ten dollars spent in Europe. 60 million US dollars is only a preliminary need, and the total number of needs is still unclear, but what China needs is food and goods, not money.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The Wedemeyer Report may be secretly opened soon. This has been hinted at by Senator Taft, who announced that he opposed Marshall's request to use 60 million US dollars as the first batch of loans in the 300 million US dollar aid to China plan. Taft secretly told the press: "The Republican Party will certainly propose to publish the Wedemeyer Report." Taft made this statement after being questioned continuously for a long time about the Republican Party's future policy. Taft's statement was made only one day after his speech in New York stating that aid to China and Europe should be considered together.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Official sources stated today that if the United States only provides China with 300 million US dollars before July 1, 1949, unless accompanied by other grants, it will not satisfy China's hopes and needs. Although the highest authorities remained silent on US Secretary of State Marshall's statement in Congress, general public opinion believes that this limited aid to China plan will not solve China's serious situation unless it is supplemented.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Coup in Siam</h3>
<p>Since the coup in Siam on the 9th, the situation has not yet become entirely clear, and the governments of various countries are still largely maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. According to reports, the recent coup in Siam was initiated by Pibul, the former Prime Minister of "Thailand" who had collaborated with Japan. There were no reports of bloodshed in the Bangkok area. By the 10th, a new government was established, with Aphaiwong serving as Prime Minister, while Pibul retreated behind the scenes. The government announced the abolition of the Regency Council, the revision of the new constitution, and the assumption of state affairs by the soon-to-be-of-age monarch, currently in Switzerland, with the assistance of a Privy Council composed of five members. This newly established Privy Council immediately amended the constitution, restoring some previously abolished powers to the King of Siam, and reinstated the bicameral parliamentary system. The King of Siam in Geneva has also prepared to accept the fait accompli. At this point, the situation since the coup in Siam seemed to be gradually stabilizing. However, according to a Reuters report from Bangkok on the 11th, the highest deputy commander of the new Siamese regime, General Phin Choonhavan, stated that the Siamese regular army has engaged in war with the "Siamese People's Resistance Army," and the authorities have ordered defense forces across the country to prepare to mobilize within 24 hours. The coup in Siam is feared to be unavoidable bloodshed. The fact that the situation in Siam has not yet become entirely clear lies here. We have synthesized reports from various sources and believe that the following points regarding the situation in Siam are worth noting:</p>
<p>First, the coup in Siam does not appear to be a sudden event; it has historical roots. Needless to say, examining the reasons why Pibul has regained power, it is not difficult to see the cause in the unfortunate assassination of the Siamese King's palace in mid-May of last year. In April of last year, King Ananda Mahidol of Siam signed an order promulgating a new constitution, characterized by a bicameral parliamentary system and the publicization of political party activities. However, within a month, the king was assassinated, and the truth remains unclear to this day. The first task of the result of the coup, was to amend this constitution, restore the bicameral parliamentary system, and appoint members of the upper house. The coup seems to be inevitably related to the assassination of the king last year.</p>
<p>Second, Pibul is the leader of this coup, but he does not take credit for it and is content to stay behind the scenes. His methods appear to be quite clever on the surface, but they still cannot deceive the people of the world. Pibul is known as the "Siamese Mussolini." He is a figure who participated in the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" called for by the Japanese militarists. While his prestige in Siam allows him to influence Siamese politics, his position under the rule of the Japanese militarists in the past makes it impossible for him to come to the forefront again in reality. Therefore, although the coup was promoted by Pibul, the figures who came forward were members of the Democratic Party such as Aphaiwong. Like the situation in England and France, the coup in Siam somewhat resembles the result of the English and French municipal elections, which is the resurgence of right-wing forces. However, the color is more intense and resembles fascism in Siam. Under this situation, even if there is resistance within Siam, bloodshed is unavoidable, but the general trend suggests that resistance will be ineffective. In any case, the coup cannot be said to be a move against the democratic trend.</p>
<p>Third, according to official announcements, the coup in Siam was intended to end the corrupt internal affairs of Siam, improve the people's livelihood, and cleanse officialdom. However, according to reports, we can easily see that the coup in Siam is less about internal affairs and more about external affairs. This can be seen in two aspects. First, the border disputes between Siam and Vietnam have not yet been resolved. In the past, with the assistance of the Japanese, Siam signed a treaty with Vichy France to cede part of Vietnam to Siam. After the end of the war, this treaty was torn up by France; however, Siam has never forgotten its desire for land in the eastern Cambodia area. Pibul was the commander of the army fighting on the border at the time. The success of the coup he led can be said to be a threat to Vietnam. After the success of the coup, the authorities seemed to be reconsidering the demand for the demarcation of the Siamese-Vietnamese border to cover up the failure to improve the domestic situation. Second, the coup in Siam seems to be flirting with Washington, perhaps another speculation by Pibul on the political stage. The coup led by Pibul this time received the support of the Democratic Party; and many of the members of the Democratic Party are pro-American. Prime Minister Aphaiwong has been to the United States as Siam's representative to the United Nations. In addition, Pramoj, the former ambassador to the United States who chanted "Free Thailand," is also a key figure in the Siamese Democratic Party. He also maintained contact with the US Office of Strategic Services during the war. It can be seen that the coup in Siam inevitably has a posture of throwing itself into the arms of the United States.</p>
<p>From the perspective of our China, the coup in Siam will be a sign of the resurgence of the "Greater Thai Nationalism" slogan. From the perspective of the Three Principles of the People, we are happy to see the rise of Siamese nationalism, but the "Greater Thai Nationalism" symbolized by Pibul inevitably had discriminatory treatment of our overseas Chinese in Siam in the past. Even after Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, there was still a large-scale anti-Chinese movement, carrying out massacres and plunder against our compatriots. On the other hand, it imitated Hitler's style of "recovering lost territory," and often had delusional thoughts of coveting and wooing the Yi people residing in our southwestern border areas, especially the "Bai Yi" in Yunnan. Therefore, the success of the coup led by Pibul this time may be the resurgence of the "Greater Thai" movement. We want to see the rise of the Siamese nation, but we do not want to see the resurgence of anti-Chinese and anti-China movements. In particular, we cannot forget Pibul's past assistance to Japan in fighting the United Nations. If Pibul wants to reform himself, he should first change his old policies, so that Sino-Siamese relations will not have a negative impact.</p>

<h3>Head of Military Law Office Talks About the Case of Arresting Communist Bandits in Beiping</h3>
<p>"Direct Arrest" is Legally Justified</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, December 12] The case of communist espionage cracked in this city a month ago is complex. Because the clues of this case continue to be cracked in various places, the handling of this important case has attracted attention from all parties. The reporter specially visited Yin, the head of the military law office of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, to inquire about the handling of this case. According to the conversation: The content of this case has not yet reached the stage of publication and will be announced by the central government in a unified manner in the future. However, what can be told is that the arrested criminals are all guilty and have confessed without hesitation. Meng Xian Gong's letter to President Hu admitted "doing illegal things and being extremely ashamed," which shows a glimpse of their current mentality. Regarding the issue of investigation and trial, according to the organizational regulations of the headquarters promulgated by the national government, it has the power to investigate and try governance cases. This case has a significant relationship with public security, and the case involves a wide range of issues and is still under investigation. This is the duty of the headquarters and the responsibility of the headquarters. As for the communist criminals without military status, the investigation stage falls under the jurisdiction of the headquarters. As for the issue of who will have the power of trial in the future, it has been reported to the central government for interpretation, and it can be decided after the central government approves it. However, both judicial and military laws are based on legal proceedings. Some people in the society believe that military trials are more serious and judicial proceedings are more relaxed, which is a misconception. The case is serious, there are many accomplices, and they are all caught in the act. In order to avoid the destruction of evidence and the escape of accomplices, "direct arrest" must be carried out. This should be done in fact, and there is a legal basis for it. Some newspapers have criticized the arrest reported in this case as "illegal arrest" and said that the headquarters has not promptly transferred the case to the court as "delay." The arguments seem to be misunderstood. In short, the case is of great importance, and the investigation and interrogation should be carried out with an extremely cautious attitude and under the principles of reasonableness and legality.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Yu Zisan Case, Three Criminals Were Publicly Prosecuted for Secretly Forming a Society to Help the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, December 12] Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin, who are related to the Yu Zisan case at Zhejiang University, have been investigated and concluded by Li Zaipeng, prosecutor of the Zhejiang Higher Court, and formally prosecuted on the 12th. The criminal facts, evidence, and legal provisions listed in the indictment are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin, etc., formed the New Trend Society in Meitan, Guizhou in the spring of the third year of the Republic of China, and were instructed by the Communist Party to expand its scope. The society members were distributed in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Taipei, Fenghua, Pinghu, and other places. Chen Jianxin served as the president, Huang Shimin served as the head of the accounting department, and Li Bojin served as the head of the academic department, actively promoting the society's affairs. The</p>
<p>Main tasks</p>
<p>There are three types: open up a diligent farming farm as the economic foundation of the society's business. Organize an election campaign organization, planned by Yu Zisan (deceased), the head of the society in Hangzhou, to strive for representative seats in the student self-government associations of various departments and grades at Zhejiang University, secretly participate in the National Student Federation led by the CCP, and attempt to manipulate student unrest. Establish reading clubs, presided over by Li Bojin, head of the society's academic department, collect various left-leaning newspapers and books, instill communist theory, secretly recruit members, and instigate communist peripheral work. The defendants Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin came to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 25th of last month, carrying a large number of secret documents, and summoned Yu Zisan and Li Bojin to the Datong Hotel for a secret meeting late at night. The security authorities tracked and eavesdropped based on secret reports from Beijing and Shanghai, and arrested them on the spot and searched the documents. Except for Yu Zisan, who committed suicide while in custody at the Security Command, all others were sent to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>Evidence and Legal Provisions: It has been found that the defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin all held important positions in the New Trend Society. The society was not registered with the government, but its affairs were actively promoted, and the funds used</p>
<p>Very large amount</p>
<p>All of them are admitted by the defendants and there are receipts and expenditure accounts seized on the spot that can be checked. The society also organized a secret organization within Zhejiang University, striving for representatives of student self-government associations in order to participate in the National Student Federation led by the CCP, and there are also statements made by Yu Zisan in the original transcribed record of the conversation, such as "Someone ordered me to do this, who I can't say now," etc., which is sufficient to prove this. As for the establishment of reading clubs to instill communist ideology, this is very clear from the learning outline drafted by the defendant Li Bojin. Moreover, the reading list includes more than 50 kinds of left-wing theoretical books such as the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Dialectical Materialism, Preliminary Theory of Ideological Methodology, Mao Zedong's Seventh Congress Documents, the "Four Big Families," and Red Star Over China, etc. They were read separately, and reports were limited, and there are also handwritten records by Li Bojin to prove this, which is even more convincing that it is a secret education method in coordination with the Communist Party. It has also been found that the society's various activities have accepted the practices of the Communist Party, and in fact have been integrated with the Communist Party</p>
<p>Integrated as one</p>
<p>And is responsible for liaison, and Yu Zisan also clearly stated in the original transcribed record of the conversation that there is no difference. This kind of statement by a criminal can be adopted as evidence of a crime. The Communist Party intends to seize the country and subvert the government, and its crimes are obvious. The government has already ordered to suppress the rebellion. The defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin, etc. have carried out the important tasks of the New Trend Society, and the tasks of the New Trend Society are to help the Communist Party promote planning and strengthen training, as has been proved above. Then the defendants have violated Article 30, Paragraph 1, and more than 100 Article 1 of the Criminal Law. The defendants are all young students who have gone astray because their will is not firm. Although their situation is pitiful, since they have violated the Criminal Law, they should be prosecuted according to the law. Except for the defendant Yu Zisan, who died before the court accepted the case, he should be exempted from discussion. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with the provisions of Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3>The Unique Cotton Production in Shaanxi Province (Part 2) - Special Correspondent Hu Chang of Our Newspaper's Xi'an Airmail</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee recently decided to implement a joint cotton price negotiation in six districts, including Xi'an, as part of a joint voucher distribution method with the Unified Cotton Yarn. The negotiation method in the north will temporarily use a price equivalent to seven shi dan of medium wheat for one shi dan of 7/8 fine short-staple white cotton as the standard. Currently, grain prices and cotton prices are moving in opposite directions in this area. Ordinary raw cotton costs about 2 million yuan per dan, while wheat has been quoted at 600,000 yuan per dan in recent days. This ratio is clearly unbalanced, and the raw cotton costing 2 million yuan per dan, plus transportation costs to Shanghai, cannot compete with the Shanghai market price. If the price is negotiated according to the standard of seven dan of wheat, the negotiation will inevitably fail, only disrupting the cotton market and not helping the situation. When Mr. Wu Weijing came here, the local Central Bank convened two meetings with various relevant parties. The unanimous conclusion was that under the current circumstances, cotton price negotiation in Xi'an was temporarily unnecessary.</p>
<p>The cotton industry in Xi'an believes that Shaanxi cotton faces two major difficulties: a shortage of cash and transportation obstructions. If these two difficulties are not overcome, the prospects and prices of Shaanxi cotton will not improve. The Central Bank's cash is often transported by plane, each time carrying 10-20 billion yuan. As soon as it arrives, it is snatched up by various banks, leading to a premium on checks, which at its peak reached 10%. The more serious transportation problem is that before the obstruction, Shaanxi cotton could still be exported in large quantities. Now, this is no longer possible. Currently, everyone is using one of three routes: The first route is from Xi'an via Shiji to Chongqing, then down the Yangtze River to Shanghai. This route is currently passable, but not economical. It takes about 40 days, and the transportation cost of each ton of raw cotton is about 11 million yuan. The second route is from Xi'an via Ankang to Laohekou, then by boat downstream. This takes about a month, and the transportation cost is about 7 million yuan per ton. This route is relatively short and reasonably ideal. The final route is along the Xi-Jing Highway (Xi'an to Jingmen) to Hankou downstream. This route takes about half the time and transportation cost of the second route, but the area around Shangxian and Luonan is insecure and uncertain. Finally, it is necessary to mention the air transport route. An aircraft can only transport 5.5 tons of cotton, and the cost of transporting each ton of raw cotton to Shanghai is 24 million yuan. Even if we ignore the uneconomical nature, what use is such a small amount of transportation?</p>
<p>Currently, due to transportation obstructions, high-quality Shaanxi cotton, piled high like mountains, has been reduced to a low price of 2 million yuan, and sales are still sluggish, which inevitably affects the interest of Shaanxi cotton farmers in planting cotton. On the other hand, Shanghai yarn factories spend high transportation costs and overcome many difficulties to transport the cotton to Shanghai, but they still cannot make a profit. As a result, they all have to shy away from Shaanxi cotton. This phenomenon is extremely contradictory.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 4th, business leaders in Xi'an held a grand banquet to welcome Mr. Wu Weijing. Mr. Wu was invited to report on the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution and the Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee's motives for implementing cotton price negotiations. He then listened to the opinions of the Xi'an business community. Mr. Di Chenqingyu of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance, standing from the perspective of the local government, hoped that the current cotton price negotiations would not be so high that yarn factories could not continue production, nor so low that cotton farmers would no longer plant cotton. Mr. Li Guozhen, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, looking forward to the future cultivation of Shaanxi cotton, called for attention to three major issues: water conservancy, fertilizer, and pest control. There was also a unanimous and pressing demand to solve the two major obstacles of cash and transportation. In order to preserve and promote this rich and pure cotton production, to encourage cotton farmers to increase production next year, and to solve the raw material problems of yarn factories nationwide, these urgent suggestions are worth asking the relevant central authorities to jointly seek a reasonable solution.

<h3>Condemning the Franco Regime - The United Nations Reopens the Issue - China, the United States, and Other Countries Oppose Economic Sanctions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, November 11] Chinese representative Jiang Tingbi declared in the UN Political Committee today: Spain is undoubtedly a totalitarian regime, and China has no diplomatic relations with Spain. Military sanctions are certainly inappropriate, as they lack a legal basis. Regarding economic sanctions, it is also quite questionable whether we can find their legal basis in the Charter. Economic sanctions will cause suffering to the people, and may also create poverty in the countries implementing the sanctions. Jiang warned that Franco might use economic sanctions to strengthen domestic hopes. The Franco regime remained unchanged throughout last year, so this year's General Assembly does not need to move forward or backward. Someone proposed reaffirming</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, November 11] US representative Fahy today opposed the Soviet bloc's proposal to overthrow the Franco regime in Spain through economic sanctions in the UN Political Committee. It is said that the United States opposes any action to initiate reform through violence. The Spanish people will take steps to restore their international status at the appropriate time and in their own way. Polish representative Lange, who attacked Franco in the Security Council last April, again asked the Committee and the General Assembly to invoke the provisions of the UN Charter to completely or partially sever economic ties with Spain. It is said that the General Assembly passed a resolution on December 12 last year, calling on member states to recall their envoys to Spain. At the same time, if a democratic government in Spain is not established within an appropriate period, the Security Council should consider appropriate steps. The situation has not improved since then. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Lange, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States did not recall their envoys, and their relations with Spain were becoming more cordial, and trade between those countries had increased. Czech representative also supported Lange, while the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Canada, Pakistan, Peru, and Chile opposed.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Preliminary Foreign Aid Estimate Considered Too High by Taft - Also Dissatisfied with the Harriman Report</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Marshall told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 11th that transitional assistance would be managed by the existing agencies of the State Department, while long-term assistance would require a different type of management organization, and this matter should be decided by Congress.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, November 11] Secretary of State Marshall told Congress on the 11th that the United States would need $2.657 billion in foreign aid for this fiscal year. Republican leader Senator Taft immediately declared that he "flatly opposed allowing so much." Taft refused to say what figure he advocated, but said he would review the plan. He also refused to comment on Marshall's statement that the administration needed $7.5 billion for the fifteen-month plan starting April 1 next year, including $1.5 billion in the request submitted today. According to Taft, he believes that the $575 million in emergency aid recommended by the Harriman Committee is "too high and quite dangerous."</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Advocates an Anglo-American-French Alliance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, December 12] De Gaulle called for an alliance of Britain, France, and the United States at a press conference today to resist the communist threat in the world and promote the reconstruction of Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility of a third world war, he replied, "It would be unwise not to face the facts. Although a new war is a possibility, we must face this possibility and prepare for it." He believes that his movement can seize power without civil war. He said, "I do not believe that French public opinion desires civil war or armed destruction, but if a war occurs, the legal system must maintain its strength." He also suggested concluding a legal agreement to resist the communist threat and reorganize Western Europe. De Gaulle also said that France's main goal is to prevent Germany from becoming a centralized state again. Finally, he said that he has always disapproved of Franco's Spain, but this does not prevent us from maintaining relations with Spain, especially economic relations.</p>

<h3>US and Soviet Union Blame Each Other for Obstructing Atomic Energy Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, December 12] The Overseas Press Association held its 30th anniversary celebration tonight, as well as the Second Annual United Nations Dinner. Soviet representative Vyshinsky and US representative Austin were both invited to the banquet to deliver speeches. The two men blamed each other for obstructing the establishment of an agreement to control atomic energy. Vyshinsky reiterated his previous statement that the United Nations had no right to interfere in the Korean issue. Vyshinsky expressed his ability regarding the "resolution to ban atomic bombs has not been effective" after one year, and pointed out that "US diplomatic leaders thought that they could break the Soviet Union's atomic bombs." Besides, it seemed that the Soviet Union already had atomic bombs. The Soviet representative announced that the motivation of Soviet foreign policy was peace, and the US policy expressed by Marshall's plan and the Truman Doctrine was "hostility and slander" towards the Soviet Union. Austin refuted Molotov's speech last week declaring that the secret of pressure bombs no longer exists. He refuted the Soviet Union's claim that the United States was obstructing the world atomic agreement, and said that of the fifteen countries participating in the Atomic Energy Commission, all countries except the Soviet Union and Poland had reached a unanimous agreement on basic issues, so the blame for obstruction lies with the Stravinsky Group.</p>

<h3>Unifying the Nile River Basin - Egypt is Determined and Farouk Explains the Policy</h3>

Egypt must not negotiate a bargain on the unification of Egypt and Sudan.

<h3>Magnificent Performance at the Majestic Theatre: Commemorating the Father of the Nation's Birthday, Emphasis on Spirit Over Form, Various Leaders in Attendance Offer Words of Encouragement</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Reports" Yesterday was the birthday of the Father of the Nation, a day celebrated throughout the city with flags. All government offices, schools, and banks were closed for the day. At 9:00 AM, various sectors of Shanghai society gathered at the Majestic Theatre to hold a general assembly commemorating the Father of the Nation's birthday. Attendees included representatives from all walks of life and over a thousand citizens. The presidium consisted of Wu Guozhen, Li Shizeng, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Zhang Wei, Zhang Xiaosong, Cao Jun, Xie Renzhao, Wang Xiaolai, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xianqing, Jin Zhenyu, and others.</p>
<p>As the assembly began, Mayor Wu led the attendees in observing traditional ceremonies. In his address, he stated, "We should silently contemplate the greatness of the Father of the Nation and strive to emulate him. Every action of the Father of the Nation was for the sake of the nation and its people, ultimately leading to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of the Republic of China. All of us citizens should deeply reflect on whether we are being selfish and self-serving, and whether our actions are worthy of the nation and its people. We must be inspired by the Father of the Nation's great spirit and put it into practice." Central Committee member Li Shizeng, in his address, elucidated that the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is to achieve universal harmony. He emphasized that abstract and formalistic commemorations of the Father of the Nation's birthday are meaningless; it is essential to embody his spirit and concretely demonstrate it in our work.</p>
<p>Emulating Revolutionary Spirit</p>
<p>Director Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, in his address, stated: "As we commemorate the Father of the Nation, we should re-examine and reflect upon the revolutionary environment and our own responsibilities. How should we strive in the future? First, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's revolutionary spirit. The Father of the Nation dedicated his life to revolution, experiencing countless failures. However, with each failure, his revolutionary conviction grew stronger. Failure is the mother of success, and he was able to overcome hardships and difficulties, realizing his vision. The Father of the Nation faced peril in London and Guangzhou, remaining steadfast and composed in the face of adversity. This resolute will and indomitable spirit are worthy of our emulation. Not only the Father of the Nation, but also President Chiang, faced similar trials. When Chen Jiongming betrayed the revolution, President Chiang, then in his hometown of Fenghua, upon hearing the news, traveled day and night to face the crisis. This spirit of sharing weal and woe is truly worthy of our emulation."</p>
<p>Practicing Thrift and Frugality</p>
<p>"Second, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of thrift and frugality. The Father of the Nation dedicated himself to the revolution, enduring hardships and striving for the nation and its people, paying little attention to his own clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. The Father of the Nation was not particular about his clothing, not even owning a complete set of formal robes. Once, when receiving foreign dignitaries, he had to borrow a set from the current President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Jitao. This set of clothes was later carefully wrapped by Madam Sun and returned to Mr. Dai after the Father of the Nation passed away in Beijing. Our President, influenced by the Father of the Nation, also embodies a spirit of frugality similar to that of the Father of the Nation. The President eats very simply and dresses very plainly, a stark contrast to those who are extravagant. In short, as we practice thrift today, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of frugality and take the President's frugal lifestyle as a model for the daily lives of all citizens."</p>
<p>Intensifying the Suppression of Bandits and Nation-Building</p>
<p>"Third, intensify the suppression of bandits and nation-building. Why must we emulate the Father of the Nation's revolutionary spirit and his spirit of frugality? It is for the sake of suppressing bandits and building the nation. In the case of Nanjing and Shanghai, we seek stability in society. As the saying goes, 'Stability first, construction comes next.' We will not tolerate underground communist agents and their echo chambers disrupting and sabotaging Shanghai. Speaking of nation-building, we must uphold the Father of the Nation's teachings and implement democratic constitutionalism. Now that the general election is approaching, provinces and cities must organize elections for the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan. Shanghai, as a national model and for the sake of international reputation, must pay special attention to this election. Those engaged in campaigning must have the demeanor and ethics of democratic politics. Voters should value character and cherish their right to vote, not belittling themselves or abandoning their rights. We must ensure that the effects of democratic politics are fully realized in Shanghai, making Shanghai's election a model for the entire nation."</p>
<p>Continuing to Fulfill His Legacy</p>
<p>Speaker Pan stated in his address: "Today, the entire nation is focusing its will and gathering its strength to suppress bandits and build the nation. President Chiang has already instructed that bandit suppression is 30% military and 70% political. Without enlightened politics, bandit suppression cannot be completed quickly, and if politics are not clear, then while we are suppressing bandits on one hand, the people are unable to live, and poverty and frustration are creating bandits on the other. Mencius said, 'If the ruler has no moral standards and the subordinates have no laws to follow, then the country is sure to perish.' A country must have moral standards, which is governance through virtue, and laws to follow, which is governance through law. Governing the country within the scope of morality and law ensures that politics are clear. Article 1 of the Constitution states that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People, democracy, and civil rights. Today, we use the Three Principles of the People as our moral standard and the Constitution as our law to follow. With moral standards above and laws to follow below, a republic based on the Three Principles of the People can be built. The Father of the Nation dedicated his life to the nation and its people, exhausting himself. His legacy awaits those of us who are still alive to continue and complete." Following this, Commander Xuan, Wang Xiao, Jin Zhenyu, and others delivered their addresses.</p>

A screening of the film "China's Resistance Against Japan" followed as entertainment.</p>
<h3>Youth Jumps Out of Window in Desperation, Injuring Elderly Woman, and Himself</h3>

<h3>Transportation Company to Celebrate Second Anniversary of Service</h3>

<p>Since the armistice two years ago, the recovery and progress of various countries have been extremely rapid. French industrial production has recovered to 93% of pre-war levels. The Benelux countries have almost fully recovered. Italy's recovery has reached 60%. The recovery in the British and American occupied zones of western Germany has reached 46%. Although Britain suffered heavy losses during the war, its merchant shipping tonnage has almost recovered by half, its export trade has exceeded pre-war levels, and its industrial production has increased to 115% of pre-war levels. In fact, the recovery plans of various countries are generally no more than the usual methods of increasing production, practicing economy, and controlling prices and finance. There are no surprising secrets or shortcuts. The reason for such rapid success, although there are various reasons, the most important is still the long-term democratic politics. The government can clearly distinguish between right and wrong, strictly reward and punish, and have the determination to implement government orders. The people can recognize their interests, abide by the law, and embrace the spirit of shared prosperity and common survival for the country. I have been away from the country for over a year and am not very familiar with the recent situation in the country. I will contact and discuss with all parties at any time in the future, hoping to make some practical suggestions on the current economic problems.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the Commodity Exhibition Hall, Unprecedented Enthusiasm from Visitors</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Reports" The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday in the Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. No less than thousands of attendees, including heads of various government offices, Chamber of Commerce representatives, and guests from all walks of life, created an unprecedentedly grand scene. Before the meeting even began, the auditorium was already packed. The crowd's mood was extremely enthusiastic. Chairman Xu Jiyin first delivered an opening speech, briefly stating: The exhibition hall was originally created by Nie Yuntai in 1921. After the August 13th Incident, it was occupied by Japanese invaders and completely destroyed. After two years of restoration, it has been successfully rebuilt. I hope that the entire country will unite to promote domestic goods to make up for losses. Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech urging the people of the country to pay attention to industry and commerce, consolidate the foundation of the nation, and hope that Shanghai will take the lead in creating greater stability and prosperity. Wang Xiaolai, who had just returned from the United States at 8:00 PM the night before, also rushed to participate. He expressed admiration for the American spirit of law-abidingness and service and hoped that the people would catch up, never again living in a state of blissful ignorance. Subsequently, Zhang Renyou (on behalf of Wu Kaixian), Qin Runqing, Xia Chang, and Shou Jingying delivered speeches. After the ceremony, they led guests to visit the exhibition hall and presented coupons. At this point, the crowd rushed out of the door, crowding towards the exhibition hall. North Henan Road was congested as a result. The length of the "queue" was truly an unprecedented feat since the victory.</p>
<h3>Funeral Hearse Arrives Suddenly at Birthday Banquet</h3>
<p>Zhang Yongkang, a resident of No. 121 Henan North Road, currently employed at a certain command headquarters in Jiangning, was celebrating his mother's birthday the day before. Around 5:00 PM, just as the guests had gathered and the banquet was beginning, a hearse from the Shangtian Funeral Home suddenly arrived in front of the door. The driver entered and asked, "Where is the corpse?" Zhang was greatly shocked to hear this. After questioning, it was learned that someone had called the hearse to his residence to pick up a corpse. It is reported that Zhang considered this to be very unlucky and negotiated with the Shangtian Funeral Home. He also reported the matter to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Escaped Slaughter-Bound Ox Injures Four</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Reports" Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, a cattle dealer named Cao Shengxian transported several oxen from the countryside to the Hongkou slaughterhouse for slaughter. As Cao was leading the oxen past Liyang Road and Wusong Road, he tied the ox ropes to the side of the road to allow them to rest. Unexpectedly, one of the oxen broke free from its rope and ran wildly forward. It ran from Shajing Road to Wuzhou Road, turned onto Lushun Road, and then passed Shangqiu Road. Upon reaching Yalu River Road, it struck a rickshaw puller named Xu Zigao (31 years old, from Yancheng), piercing his anus with its horns and causing a heavy flow of blood, severely injuring him. Pedestrians Liu Dongshan, Zhou Haitang, and Tang Daocheng were also injured in the head, face, and arms. After police officers arrived, they took the ox to the police precinct and sent the injured to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment.</p>

During my spare time, I investigated the economic situation in Europe and the United States. Over the years, I have had many observations.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Returns to Shanghai, Praises American Lawfulness, Newspaper Stands Do Not Require Supervision, Every Citizen is Literate</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Reports" Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, returned to Shanghai yesterday after visiting the United States on the first passenger flight of the China National Aviation Corporation to the United States on the 6th of last month. He spent a total of thirty-five days, traveling through half of America. Last night, reporters paid a special visit to Mr. Wang to ask him to share his observations from the trip. According to him, this trip to the United States was entirely in a private capacity and under no official title. He has traveled to almost all major cities and important industries in the United States, and has been warmly received by overseas Chinese and local business groups everywhere, who led him to visit and explained things in detail, which has greatly increased his knowledge. Although the democratic and rule-of-law spirit of American politics has long been praised, it is difficult to know the truth without experiencing it firsthand. During these thirty days in the United States, I was able to appreciate the truth. Every government order can be implemented, and the people can abide by the law. For example, if a car violates the law, the police come forward to correct it and issue a notice. The driver then goes to the designated police station the next day to receive the penalty according to the notice. Public security has indeed been able to achieve a state where doors are not closed at night and lost items are not picked up. Newspaper stands on the streets of New York City allow pedestrians to take the newspaper themselves and put the amount due in the box. No one manages it, but no one takes a newspaper without paying. Cars rarely honk on the road, which shows the excellence of their traffic order. Even more commendable is the universality and development of American national education, which can be a model for our country. From elementary school to high school, education is compulsory and obligatory. All expenses are borne by the state, and books and stationery are also provided free of charge. If parents do not allow their children to attend school, the parents will be subject to legal punishment. Therefore, every American citizen is literate, and college students are everywhere. The use of machinery has reached its peak. Not only is machinery used in industry, but agriculture is also completely mechanized. A farmer can cultivate hundreds of acres of land with the help of machinery.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also stated that the prosperity of the United States has reached a state of truth, goodness, and beauty. From the White House to the farmhouses, everything is beautiful. Even the arrangement of a small fruit shop strives for beautification. Bananas and apples are arranged according to color to attract customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang praised the humorous broadcasting of American commercial advertisements as "living comedy." The method is very different from the comedians singing in the city's radio stations. When these artists perform comedy, they allow listeners to ask questions freely, and they answer on the spot. The listeners are sure to choose the most sudden and embarrassing questions to ask, and the artists are sure to be able to answer in the most agile and humorous tone. Now, American radio listeners love to listen to this kind of "comedy," so the advertising effect is also very strong.</p>
<h3>Ding Guitang Clarifies Allegations in the Java Returnee Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Reports" Recent reports that Deputy Chief Tax Officer Ding Guitang went to the wharf to welcome Huang Yuyi of the Zhongnan Bank and was suspected of shielding smuggling have attracted considerable attention. Yesterday, reporters paid a special visit to Deputy Chief Tax Officer Ding to inquire about what happened that day. According to him, Mr. Huang Yuyi is a long-time friend, and he returned from Java on the Zhizhajialian transport. He went to the wharf to welcome him out of friendship, which is only natural. At that time, Mr. Huang was not carrying luggage, and I did not know how much luggage he had. I only told the customs officer on duty to "inspect" and release Mr. Huang's luggage as soon as possible. It was not until 6:00 PM that day that someone from Zhongnan Bank called to inform me that Mr. Huang's luggage had been detained and they did not know why. I immediately called the customs officer to inquire. It was reported that he was carrying a lot of luggage, and some of it seemed suspicious. I told the customs officer in charge to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations, and at the same time, I replied to Zhongnan, informing them of the relevant customs regulations and that I was sorry that I could not help. This is the complete truth of what happened that day from my side. This can be verified by the report of the customs officer on duty at the Jianghai Customs. As for whether there are indeed smuggled goods in the luggage, it remains to be inspected. If there are smuggled goods, the Jianghai Customs will naturally handle them in accordance with the regulations. Not only am I inconvenienced, but I also do not want to inquire or intervene. I have served in the customs for more than thirty years and I am confident that I have been dedicated to public service, abiding by the law, and strictly disciplining myself. I do not engage in business for profit, nor do I engage in fraud for personal gain. To say that I am shielding smuggling is something I have never dreamed of since entering the customs. Although I now live in a residence and have transportation, all of these are publicly owned properties. If I am no longer a customs official, then my living and transportation will become a problem, and I may even feel anxious about my food and clothing. I am molded by the good discipline of the customs and I am honest and upright by nature, abiding by the law and not being biased. Perhaps because of this, I have offended people. In the past ten years, people have anonymously accused and fabricated accusations against me at the higher levels, but the results have all been unfounded. All of these have been recorded in the Ministry. I live my life with a clear conscience and I believe that I can be considered to have fulfilled my duties to the country and the customs. However, in this time of rampant desires and moral decay, one cannot help but sigh, "It is difficult to be an official, and it is even more difficult to be a good official."</p>
<h3>Ancient Burial Figurines with Historical Value: Artifacts from the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty Displayed in the Museum, Different Poses Come Across Vividly</h3>
<p>"This Newspaper Special" The Municipal Museum displays relics from the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty called "Yong" (figurines).</p>
<p>The so-called "Yong" can be interpreted as "slaves or servants of the dead." They are magnetic clay figures that resemble toys and are most commonly found in ancient tombs near Luoyang.</p>
<p>Chinese customs believe that the soul does not perish after death, that there is a ghost world and an underworld, and that ghosts, like humans, have needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Therefore, when a person dies, his family prepares for his posthumous enjoyment. Modern folk customs involve burning paper figures and funerary objects to be used by the dead, but during the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty, "Yong" and their objects were made of clay, coated with glazed porcelain, and buried with the deceased in the tomb.</p>
<p>Various Kinds and Shapes</p>
<p>The "Yong" displayed in the museum range from about two feet in height to as small as three or four inches. There are various kinds and shapes, including "Wen Yong" (civilian figurines) holding ; "Wu Yong" (military figurines) riding horses with special shields; "Wu Yong" (dancing figurines) in dancing poses; and "Xiaochou Yong" (clown figurines) in funny poses. Although these ancient relics were excavated after so many years, they still look lifelike except for the peeling of the glaze.</p>
<p>One type is called "Hu Yong" (barbarian figurines), with loose hair, sunken eyes, high noses, and faces that are very similar to those of Westerners. One "Hu Yong" has an aquiline nose, and another "Hu Yong" has a mustache with upturned tips. Several "Hu Yong" have a bulge on the side of their waists, which looks like a modern pistol. It is thought to be a type of weapon at the time. The job of these "Hu Yong" is probably like that of modern bodyguards. There is also a naked "Hu Yong" that looks somewhat like a native of Southeast Asia, with a buttocks that protrude to an "absurd" degree. This is probably an exaggeration of the Tang people's imagination.</p>
<p>Why are there so many "Hu Yong" in the tombs of the Tang Dynasty? According to archaeologists, during the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty, our country was strong, the people were rich, and contact with the Western Regions and Southeast Asia must have been quite frequent. At that time, border officials or wealthy families may have bought some so-called "Hu people" to be servants or slaves. Therefore, after death, "Hu Yong" were made to be buried with them.</p>
<p>The Clothes They Wear Are Very Interesting</p>
<p>In addition to "Hu Yong", there are also "Xiao Kunlun Yong" (little Kunlun figurines) that look like black people, and "Zhuru Yong" (dwarf figurines) that look like Japanese people, all of which are made with great care. One "Xiao Kunlun Yong" has lines close to a Greek statue, showing the artistic achievements of the time.</p>
<p>The clothes worn by the various "Yong" are very interesting. Many male costumes are very similar to modern Western-style coats and swallowtail coats with lapels in the front and an arc in the back. The female "Yong" costumes include revealing breasts and arms and evening dresses identical to those of modern Western women. Several of them are carrying handbags, which are no different from modern glass leather bags. Even more interesting is the hairstyle of the female "Yong", some of which are parted in the middle and high in the front, which can be said to be the ancestor of the "airplane head".</p>
<p>These various funerary "Yong" were only a custom at the time, but they left later generations with excellent materials for studying history and culture. If you observe carefully, you can discover even more interesting facts.</p>

<h3>Former Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang's Speech: Post-War American Trends - Concern for the Movements of Various Countries, Policy Towards China Will Change</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Report" Former Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang, who has returned from a tour of the United States, was invited by the Youth Association last night to give a two-hour public lecture entitled "Post-War American Trends." He gave a broad and concise account of transportation, industry, education, economic and social problems, and world policy. The main points of his speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Brothers, I studied in the United States twenty years ago. This time, when I revisited the old place, I felt that the United States has made much progress compared to twenty years ago. In terms of transportation, the equipment of trains has been greatly improved, with movable reclining chairs, just like the reclining chairs in airplanes. The speed of trains has increased, and they can travel eighty miles per hour, and you don't feel any vibration when sitting inside. The highways have been converted into cement pavements, and the road surface is wide enough to allow eight cars to drive at the same time. The most advanced is air transportation. The density of its network is almost equal to that of railways. Therefore, in the United States, buying an airplane ticket is as simple as buying a train ticket. The speed of airplanes is also increasing day by day. Now, it takes 32 hours to cross the Pacific Ocean from Seattle to Shanghai without stopping. I visited the Seattle aircraft factory and saw the stratospheric aircraft under construction, which can seat eighty people. If you take that plane from Seattle to Shanghai next year, you can fly there in just one day.</p>
<p>Stepping Up the Manufacturing of Cars and Refrigerators</p>
<p>In terms of industry, there has also been great progress in technology. The first reason is that the top scientists from Germany and Austria were recruited by the United States, and the second reason is that the war stimulated and accelerated industrial research and invention. Now the United States is restoring all military factories to civilian factories, and is stepping up the manufacture of cars, refrigerators, radios, etc. However, because they have not been manufactured for four years due to the war, there is a great feeling of shortage. People generally think that it is easy to buy cars and other items in the United States, but this is not the case. Because there are so many people who need them, you often have to register and wait for several months before you can buy one. The current peak of steel production in the United States is 100 million tons per year, and the annual output of gasoline is 1.4 billion barrels, which is more than the total output of all countries in the world. In terms of education and culture, higher education in the United States is very developed. The University of California has the most students, with 43,000 people. Columbia University has more than 40,000 people. The University of Illinois has 28,000 people. There are more than 3 million students above the junior college level. Compared with only 110,000 college students in our country, it is naturally not the same. American education has not only increased in quantity, but also improved in quality. For example, the invention of the atomic bomb is the result of research by American scientists. Now the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are assisting universities in scientific research. In order to improve the quality of their products, large factories have also established complete laboratories and hired scientists to conduct research.</p>
<p>General Commodity Prices Have Approximately Doubled</p>
<p>In terms of the economy, the living standards of people in various countries have declined after the war, but the United States still maintains its pre-war standards. The price increase is extremely slow. From the Pearl Harbor incident to the surrender of Japan, prices rose by about 30% to 35%. After the war, price controls were lifted, rising to 60% to 70%. To date, general commodity prices are approximately double what they were before the war, while public utilities have not only not increased, but have actually decreased. For example, the subway was five cents twenty years ago, and it is still five cents now. During the war, airmail within the country was one dime, and it cost 75 cents to send it to China. Now it has been reduced to five cents within the country and 25 cents to China. The general income of Americans has also doubled. The total annual income of the people in the United States is 180 billion US dollars. The average annual income per person is 1,300 US dollars, which is the highest income in the world. After the war, 13 million soldiers were demobilized, 9 million people have found jobs, and 1.5 million people have entered universities to study. There are currently only more than 500,000 unemployed people living on government subsidies. As for the entire United States, there are less than 2 million unemployed people nationwide. Given the development of capitalism in the United States, a social revolution should have occurred. In reality, socialism is the least popular in the United States. Among the 140 million people in the United States, there are fewer than 100,000 Communist Party members. The two major labor groups, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, are both opposed to communism. Because American workers are paid very well, a skilled worker earns an average of more than 600 US dollars per month, and an ordinary worker earns more than 200 US dollars per month. Since their lives are stable, their dissatisfaction with the status quo is naturally reduced. Therefore, there is not a single Communist Party member in the U.S. Congress or Senate.</p>
<p>Waste of Resources and Moral Degradation</p>
<p>Social problems: A. Waste of resources. When Paris and London are experiencing coal shortages, every household in the United States burns coal, with temperatures above eighty degrees. This year, the potato harvest in Kansas in the southern United States is very good. Because there are too many potatoes, fearing that the price of potatoes will fall, a large number of potatoes are doused with kerosene and burned, while many countries in Europe are experiencing shortages. B. Moral degradation and increased crime. On average, one in three couples divorces, and the number of juvenile delinquents is increasing. In June of this year, a sixteen-year-old child in Wisconsin killed four of his companions. In July, a seventeen-year-old girl in California conspired with her lover to kill her parents. World policy and Sino-American relations: After World War I, the United States adopted an isolationist policy. After World War II, its policy was completely reversed, and even Vandenberg, who had always advocated the most extreme isolationism, changed his style. He greatly protected the United Nations and was very concerned about the movements of various countries in the world. As far as Sino-American relations are concerned, Sino-American relations have been the best in history, because the United States is vast and rich in resources and has no territorial ambitions, which is the same as China's national spirit. Because the policies of the two countries do not conflict, they have not only been good friends in the past, but they will always be good friends in the future. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, the United States helped China. After the Pearl Harbor incident, the two countries became allies. After the victory, the United States assisted China in receiving airfields. These are all obvious facts. Later, due to the propaganda of the Communist Party in the United States and the dissatisfaction of American reporters in China due to their difficult lives, the United States' aid to China became lukewarm, which caused a small misunderstanding between Sino-American friendship. However, the general trend of the world and the needs of the United States prompted it to change its policy of standing idly by and move towards a more active role. Recently, the publication of Pulitzer's "Impressions of a Visit to China" and Marshall's upcoming request to Congress for 300 million US dollars in aid to China illustrate that the United States' policy towards China will change. Conversely, we need assistance from others, and we must also eliminate corruption, establish a clean and honest atmosphere, and improve work efficiency. As the saying goes, Heaven helps those who help themselves."</p>
<h3>The "China Youth and Teenagers Democratic Republic Experiment Country" Declares Its Birth and Holds Its First Parliamentary Election</h3>
<p>The "China Youth and Teenagers Democratic Republic Experiment Country," a juvenile self-government organization with civic education significance sponsored by the China Youth Association, has been preparing for more than a year and was declared born in Shanghai yesterday. At the same time, the first parliamentary election was held. This republic, which has 913 citizens, is undoubtedly the smallest and most democratic country in the world.</p>
<p>Yesterday's grand and enthusiastic founding meeting of the Republic was held at the Youth Association on Sichuan Road at 2:00 pm. A national flag with a red background, blue triangle, and ten white plum blossoms in the center was hung in front of the rostrum. Hundreds of citizens of the Republic were all filled with joy, waiting for the birth of this smallest country. Many responsible persons of the Youth Association, in the capacity of guests, first expressed their sincere congratulations, hoping that this concrete and miniature national organization could help young people fully understand the true meaning of democracy and be conducive to promoting democratic education. When Lu Meiseng spoke, he criticized the erroneous concept in society that only knows the family and the individual. Therefore, he hoped that the citizens of the youth country should be careful in voting, so that the elected members can do things for the country and society. He also hoped that the young people would promote the practical experience of democratic politics to their relatives and friends, so that people in society would increase their understanding of democratic politics. Lu Ganchen used Premier Sun Yat-sen's "to build a republic and to advance to the world commonwealth" as encouragement. He also pointed out three points that people should pay attention to under democratic politics: have an attitude of respecting the value and personality of others; have a spirit of not being proud of employing people but being ashamed of serving people; and have the qualifications of "cultivating virtue and achieving talent." Tian Gengxin believed that the purpose of the Republic is to cultivate talents, serve the public, develop Christian personality and society, and practice democratic education.</p>
<p>All citizens then sang the national anthem of the Republic in unison, and then immediately held the election speeches of 46 candidates for parliament, each with three minutes. Then, voting began. Each citizen had 20 ballots, which were cast in the ballot boxes of the 20 members they supported. The citizens of the Republic are required to be members of the Youth Association between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Although there are more than 900 people, there are only more than 310 citizens with the right to vote, so the order was well-maintained, and it was completed in about an hour. The 20 elected members will convene the first Congress on a selected date, elect 9 people to form the Central Executive Committee, and elect a president and vice president each, as well as ministers of internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, justice, industry, education, and social affairs, and convene a National Assembly to pass the constitution. The new government will decide to announce its establishment next year.</p>

<h3>Three Thousand Miles of Northern Jiangsu - The Heartfelt Songs of the People</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Huaiyin Report on the 7th" This reporter followed the Huaihai Pacification Zone's pacification work inspection team to inspect various counties in northern Jiangsu. In the extremely short time of 20 days, he traveled through 15 counties and cities including Huai, Huai, Gao, Bao, Xing, Tai, Dong, Yan, Lian, Si, Su, Sui, Hai, Guan, and Lianyungang, traveling more than 3,000 li back and forth. The journey was arduous and dusty. In addition, the old turmoil had not been quelled, and wherever the vehicle went, preparations were made for combat in case of emergency. If the reporter can express the suffering accumulated in the hearts of my millions of compatriots in northern Jiangsu to the readers, then it will be more than fulfilled!</p>
<p>Although in this vast and fertile plain of northern Jiangsu, there is still a large "area" under the control or roaming of the bandit army, and although in the areas they control, they use all kinds of seductive tricks or unscrupulous terrorist policies to seduce and oppress the people into their nets, these despicable and brutal measures cannot stop the people's inclination towards the government, and cannot destroy the people's support for the government.</p>
<p>The people of northern Jiangsu, in the face of the Communist bandits’ struggles, which have surpassed the landlord and petty bourgeois classes and extended to the proletariat, are more and more convinced: the embrace of the government is warm; only by exerting all their strength and striving toward the supreme goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, can they truly protect their nation and themselves. "The lovable people of northern Jiangsu have already taken out all the strength they can muster," as former Jiangsu Sixth District Commissioner Zhang Naipan (currently the Seventh District Commissioner) told this reporter. Here, I can write a few facts to prove it.</p>
<p>The Origin of a Long Gown</p>
<p>Before Yancheng fell into enemy hands, the middle and primary school teachers there, from the time of the recovery until the eve of the withdrawal of the national army, never received a penny of salary or other allowances. They devoted themselves to public service despite their empty stomachs. In the educational circles of Yancheng, which educated for education's sake, this kind of dignified and sacred spirit has been brought into full play. One teacher once said painfully: "Fortunately, the Su Ning Sub-Office issued me a long gown, otherwise I would not have had a long gown to wear to the classroom, and would have lost the appearance of a 'teacher'."</p>
<p>In northern Jiangsu, Yancheng is the most unfortunate city. It can be said that since its recovery, it has been in a state of isolation from the outside world. Therefore, the Taicang fishermen's self-defense force, mainly composed of Yancheng people, organized a commando team for their hometown a few months ago. They entered Xinyang Port from the sea and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rear. They were about to reach the suburbs of Yancheng, but the military authorities, fearing that they would not be able to coordinate their efforts, advised them to temporarily retreat. This time, strategically speaking, although it did not achieve great results, it has given the bandit army a heavy lesson. The power of the people is infinite!</p>
<p>Ma Yuhong Designed to Bomb the Bandits</p>
<p>Staff Officer Gao Huaiyu of the Sui District told me a dramatic story. Ma Yuhong, of the Xiqiao Township Self-Defense Force in the eleventh district of Huaian County, stayed at the home of his friend Dong on August 18 this year. More than 30 bandits suddenly came at night, carrying more than 20 long and short guns, led by bandit officer Yan Taifa, and rushed into Dong's house to capture Ma Yuhong, and prepared to execute him at any time. In desperation, Ma Yuhong declared to the bandits that there were still two rifles hidden in the house. The bandits entered the house to search. Ma Yuhong took the opportunity to take a grenade and threw it at the bandit group, killing three people on the spot: the bandit district chief, the joint defense director, and the village chief. Ma then escaped over the wall. This is a story woven with blood and tears. After tasting all kinds of vicious methods of the traitorous bandits, the people of northern Jiangsu have long made up their minds that they cannot coexist with the bandits.</p>
<p>Adults Shed Tears for Children</p>
<p>Before northern Jiangsu was fully recovered, Guanyun and Donghai were isolated islands in the northeast corner of northern Jiangsu. At that time, under the heavy encirclement of the bandit army, Guanyun County had formed a situation of food exhaustion. In addition to struggling on the hunger line, everyone had to use blood and flesh to resist the bandit army's attacks. In this environment, you can often see adults shedding tears for children. Why shed tears? Because the adults saw the children's sallow faces and felt that these little lives were suffering the same incomparable torment as the masses in this tragic era, it was really too miserable. Therefore, the reporter, when he was transferred to Guanyun, felt that although the environment was bad a month ago, it was fortunate to have regained freedom after all the tribulations.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Security Command Telegraphs Each County to Ensure Public Security</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Report on the 11th] The Provincial Security Command recently telegraphed each commissioner's office and each county and municipal government, stating that the remaining bandits on the border of southern Jiangsu have not been cleared, and northern Jiangsu is the center of gravity of the military rear bordering Shandong, Anhui, and Henan. The public security of each county urgently needs to be established. All county military police and militia forces should be unified under the command of the county magistrate. When encountering bandits, they should be wiped out immediately, and various tangible and intangible methods should be used to ensure the public security of the county.

From now on, if there are bandits in a county, only the county magistrate will be questioned. If there are bandits in a district, only the commissioner will be questioned. The provincial security team stationed in each county should cooperate with the commissioner and the county magistrate and must not be slack in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Yixing Searches for Bandits - Young Women and Old Women Pretend to Be Asleep, Lift Up the Quilt, and the Hidden Bandits Appear Under the Bed, and a Pistol and Bullets Are Found</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Yixing Report on the 9th" Zhang Yongqiang, 21 years old, the deputy district chief of the bandit area in Tangsong District, assisted the bandit district chief Zhou Jinsheng in being extremely active in Xushe, secretly instigating peasants to resist rent and interest, and at the end of last month, he sneaked back to his wife's family in Shexu Village, Xushe, using it as cover. The Xushe District Office received a secret report that Zhang Yongqiang was indeed haunting Shexu Village, so it sent its directly subordinate squadron at dusk on the 5th to surround it. First, the household registration was checked, which matched the registration book. The squadron leader ordered the squadron soldiers to search separately, but there was no movement. In a bedroom, a young woman and an old woman were seen covering themselves with a quilt, pretending to be asleep. They were ordered to get up, but the young woman pretended to be sick and refused to get up. The squadron soldiers lifted up the quilt and saw Zhang Yongqiang hiding under the bed. He was arrested on the spot. A pistol and a lot of bullets were found under the bed, as well as a bundle of ridiculous red and green slogans. The diary also recorded the bandit's "nine killings and six resistances" clauses. The young woman, 17 years old, is Zhang Yongqiang's wife. Zhang Yongqiang and his wife, his wife's brother, and his mother-in-law, a total of five people, were immediately sent to the county, and their accomplices were strictly interrogated in order to continue the search and arrest.</p>

<h3>International Broadcasting Station Strengthens External Propaganda</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Chongqing Airmail on the 10th" The International Broadcasting Station (called "Voice of China" by foreign allies) has become the most powerful tool for China's external cultural propaganda after the victory. It currently has a 35KW shortwave broadcasting machine produced by the British Marconi Company and a self-made 10K shortwave broadcasting machine. It broadcasts to the world in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and Thai from 5:00 pm to 12:00 am every day. In order to strengthen cultural exchanges between the United Kingdom and the United States, the station is negotiating with the British BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), the American CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), and NBC (National Broadcasting Company) to exchange and rebroadcast special programs with each other.</p>
<p>According to what this newspaper reporter has learned: The American WTAG radio station recently sent a special letter specifying topics related to Chinese politics and economy, inviting the station to broadcast to the audience across the United States. Director Feng Jian arrived in France in August of this year, representing the Chinese government to participate in the World Broadcasting Experts Conference convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Committee. After the meeting, he passed through England and Norway, and rushed to the Arctic Circle to study the aurora borealis. He has now returned to China and will return to Chongqing from Beijing within days.</p>
<p>It is reported that as soon as the two new 20KW shortwave broadcasting machines (produced by the British Standard Company) newly installed in Nanjing complete the trial run, it is planned to move the capital to facilitate propaganda.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Cotton for Export - The Contract Is Signed Is Said to Be Inaccurate</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Xi'an Telegram on the 11th" A person in charge of the Shaanxi Finance Department said: The main income of various counties in this province is still field tax and various taxes. As for the special tax previously stipulated by the central government, only three or five counties have established departments to collect it due to the limitations of laws and regulations and local conditions, but the benefits are minimal. Lin Shuen, the secretary-general of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, said: Regarding the export of Shaanxi cotton, due to certain reasons, no contract has been signed with Chennault so far. The previous news that a contract had been signed was inaccurate. In the future, the export of Shaanxi cotton will be hoped for on the Tongguan-Luoyang road line that is about to be opened.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Filed in Chongming County for Embezzlement of Low-Priced Rice; Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>"Special dispatch from Chongming, 10th of this month" The case of Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, Huang Yixiao, and others from this county, who allegedly abused their positions to embezzle 6,600 bags of low-priced rice for personal gain, has caused a great stir throughout the county, with public resentment boiling over. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Due to recent banditry, many good citizens from neighboring Qidong, Haimen, and other counties have fled to Chongming, numbering in the tens of thousands. This small island, which could barely sustain itself, has suddenly seen such a large increase in population, making the food supply a serious problem. During the lean months of March and April this spring, grain prices soared, with multiple price increases daily. Ordinary people were unable to survive and were on the verge of starvation. The former County Magistrate Guo, witnessing this situation and fearing a major disaster, urgently convened a meeting to regulate food supplies in order to find a solution. It was decided that the county government would negotiate with grain merchants from within and outside the county who had recently won bids for 24,000 bags of provincial tax rice in the county, to obtain 6,600 bags. The County General Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Industry Association, and the Fishery Association were then instructed to distribute the rice at a low price in different districts, according to the original bid price of 50,000 yuan per bag, plus a reasonable profit margin for retailers. This benevolent policy was met with jubilation by the people. However, more than a month passed without any sign of the rice being distributed at a low price. Initially, it was thought that the handover between the old and new county magistrates had caused delays. Finally, boatmen transporting the rice secretly revealed that the rice had been embezzled by Wu Qiuping, director of the County General Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Qixiang, director of the Grain Industry Association, Wang Yixiao, director of the Fishery Association, and others, who colluded to transport it secretly to Shanghai for sale, reaping profits of hundreds of millions. When this news spread, public anger erupted. Town and village representatives Chen Yonghui and Cai Shaolun from Chengqiao Town, believing that the county government had worked hard to manage the low-price distribution and stabilize the local area, while Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, and others were only concerned with personal gain, ignoring the plight of starving people, repeatedly petitioned the relevant authorities for a thorough investigation. However, because these individuals were local dignitaries who used any means necessary to curry favor everywhere, their appeals were ignored. Undeterred, Chen Yonghui and others, disregarding everything, reported Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, Huang Yixiao, and more than ten others to the District Prosecutor's Office in late July, accusing them of abusing their power, engaging in fraudulent practices, and embezzling funds. After months of investigation, the case has been brought to public prosecution and was publicly heard on the 5th of this month. A massive crowd of people attended. The court opened at 2:00 PM, and the judge questioned the defendants repeatedly. The defendants attempted to quibble, but when asked where, when, and at what price the rice had been sold, they were speechless. At this point, the judge believed that the facts of the case were clear. However, because several other defendants had not been summoned to court, the court adjourned the hearing until a later date.</p>
<h3>Political Departments to Be Established in Each District Commissioner's Office in Guangxi</h3>

<h3>Behind the Scenes at the Venue</h3>
<p>[Special report by this newspaper] The city sports meet opened at Zhongzheng Park yesterday, coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of the Republic, and all agencies were on holiday, so Zhongzheng Park was packed.</p>
<p>Like a scene from an ancient battlefield: From morning to night, bugles and drums echoed in Zhongzheng Park, flags fluttered, and doors opened on all sides (the venue has eight gates: east, south, west, north, southeast, northeast, southwest, and northwest). In addition, more than 100 tents were scattered around the venue, creating an atmosphere of intense battle, making people feel like they were facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Competing to Be First</p>
<p>Among the tents of various schools, this newspaper's large tent attracted the most attention from the audience. The large characters "Shen Bao" written in red ink on the top of the tent attracted countless spectators to ask for news, copy records, and read the wall newspaper. Thus, this newspaper's tent became a temporary service center and information station for the venue.</p>
<p>Because they were presiding over the celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the Republic, Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan did not arrive at the venue until 11:15 AM. Amid applause, Mayor Wu said emotionally: "Middle-aged people always feel endless excitement when they see the younger generation. Bearing great responsibilities, middle-aged people have at most another 20 years, while the hopes of young people are infinite. Seeing the vitality of the next generation active in the venue today makes me feel like I am seeing the future of China." His words were heartfelt, and the students were deeply moved.</p>
<p>Before the opening ceremony, carrier pigeons soared into the sky. Because this item was not included in the program beforehand, the newspaper photographers missed this shot. During the flag-raising ceremony, because the flag-bearer was too nervous, the national flag failed to unfurl and became entangled on the rope, so the photographers regretted not being able to capture a magnificent shot of the flag flying high.</p>
<p>Ponds Everywhere</p>
<p>The most annoying thing at the venue was the difficulty of relieving oneself. Many elementary school students, unable to find a toilet, used their ingenuity and gathered several classmates to form a circle and take turns relieving themselves within the circle. As a result, many ponds and heaps of were added around the venue.</p>
<p>The group exercise performances were indeed competitive. Each school created its own unique style in terms of clothing and movements, so the venue was colorful and very moving. A parent, seeing his child wearing a brightly colored uniform and performing vigorously, suddenly sighed and said: "My son pestered me to make this outfit last week. When I refused, he cried several times and even refused to eat!"</p>
<p>Among the performances, the carpenter dance by Dongming Branch School, the sailor dance by Yanping Road National Elementary School, the sweeping dance by Feihong, the oar flag exercise by Chun, and the towel dance by Bide Branch School were the most outstanding. These students were mostly children under the age of ten, and the youngest were not even five years old. Their movements were coordinated and harmonious, and the audience applauded unanimously.</p>
<p>Two Little Ones, No Suspicion</p>
<p>When the Dongming kindergarteners performed the "Little Lamb Dance," the photographers were busy looking for shots of these innocent children. An old grandmother-like woman smiled and said, "My granddaughter danced so well, please take a picture of her! Put it in the paper tomorrow so she can be lively and cute."</p>
<p>The prizes displayed on the podium included 15 silver shields, 22 silver cups, and many framed silk banners. Most of the silver shields and silver cups were donated by the banking industry. The cups and shields from China, Central, Central Exchange, Guohua, Dalu, Jin Cheng, Silk Industry, and other banks were all exquisitely crafted and tempting. The athletes, as they walked past the podium, all gave them their attention.</p>
<p>At least 40 temporary stalls sprang up in Zhongzheng Park yesterday. One stall selling "peep shows" was surrounded by children, almost pushing over the stall and revealing the secrets of the peep shows!</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Due to the war, some faculty and students from Soochow University and Hangzhou University were unable to relocate inland. As a result, they established East China University in Shanghai. The authorities of both Soochow and Hangzhou Universities have now petitioned the Ministry of Education to exempt East China University graduates from qualification examinations or to allow each university to conduct its own examinations to simplify the process. The matter is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The Municipal People's Schools of this city are holding district work discussion meetings.

<h3>Ministry of Education to First Request a Loan from the Four Banks for Winter Coal Expenses for Faculty and Staff of Northern Universities</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th" The Ministry of Education, in response to the Beiping Executive Headquarters' suggestion to allocate 1 million national currency to each faculty and staff member of colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin for winter coal expenses to purchase coal for heating and warding off the cold, has comprehensively considered and addressed the matter, handling it in conjunction with the case of faculty and staff of colleges and universities in the Northeast and Northwest regions. The Ministry of Education has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for a special appropriation for these coal expenses. However, given the early onset of cold weather in the North, the Ministry of Education, for the sake of providing swift relief, immediately consulted with the Four Joint Offices to apply for a loan for immediate use, which will be repaid once the Executive Yuan approves the special appropriation.</p>

<h3>Once American Aid Loans to China are Realized, Commodity Prices in This City Should Improve; The Circumstances of Domestic Industries May Inevitably Face Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A responsible person from the financial sector stated: Under the current circumstances, the United States is bound to provide aid to Europe and China. Therefore, the arrival of loans is inevitable. However, after our country obtains the loans, we must practice greater frugality and streamline operations, using the funds in the most beneficial ways. American government officials have a pragmatic view on economic aid to China, believing that the main resources China lacks, such as food, medicine, and textiles, the United States can independently supply. Once the prices of these few resources are stabilized, the issue of commodity prices will be largely resolved. Washington is currently considering how much aid to China will cost and will formulate a comprehensive plan based on this. American economic aid will certainly take the form of transporting goods to China, mainly food, medicine, and clothing. This will be of great help. However, on the other hand, the loan will have its conditions in exchange. In the future, the popular sales of American goods in our country's market are also inevitable. Especially in the field of pharmaceuticals, in the past, the United States, Germany, and Switzerland competed in our country's market. Now, the United States has taken over Germany's production. The strength of its power goes without saying. Currently, the United States is enthusiastically training our country's medical personnel, teaching them how to use American medicines, providing assistance on the one hand with good intentions, but also incidentally serving their own country's industry and commerce. This one aspect can encompass the rest. In the future, the circumstances of our country's industries will inevitably face difficulties.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] An individual responsible for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee recently expressed his views on the U.S. government's plan to lend 300 million yuan to China, stating that since the U.S. government intends to loan money to China, it must have a definite plan for its use. This matter is within the purview of the United States, and it is inconvenient to make any comments. Because Washington's report was too brief, the terms of the loan are unknown. However, in the future, there will be lengthy and heated debates in Congress, and the contents will become clear. What can be said is that monthly assistance of 20 million U.S. dollars will be of considerable benefit to our country's economy. After the announcement of the Marshall talks, the black market for gold notes immediately fell, which shows one aspect of its effect.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A responsible person from a civic organization in this city expressed his views on the U.S. loan, stating briefly that this matter has been anticipated by the government and the public in our country for a long time. It is gratifying that the U.S. government can formally propose it to Congress. On this day, when there is a severe shortage of foreign exchange head counts, a subsidy of 20 million U.S. dollars per month is of great benefit. I believe that this loan will assist our country's economic construction and will not be used entirely to aid China with daily necessities. At the same time, once the loan is established, it will have a significant impact on commodity prices.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of American Flour and Wheat Can Be Shipped Within the Month, Totaling Approximately 28,000 Tons</h3>
<p>The first batch of food in the Sino-American relief agreement, which has been approved, is 17,000 tons of wheat and 11,000 tons of flour, and is planned to be shipped within the month and arrive in China within the year. It is now known that after the U.S. Consulate has discussed the matter with the Central Trust Bureau for several days, the U.S. side agrees that the CTB can set up a receiving agency in the U.S. in advance and handle transportation matters.</p>
<p>It is also known that the wheat portion may be handed over to various flour mills in this city for processing and milling, calculated at a ratio of seven to three for raw materials and finished products. In the future, 11,900 tons of foreign flour can be obtained.</p>
<h3>Application Registration Method for Profitable and Freelance Professions</h3>
<p>Article 6 and 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Profit and Tax Law by the Ministry of Finance have been approved and notified to various direct tax bureaus on record. According to the provisions of the amended document, all business premises for profit-making businesses and freelancers should apply for registration with the local competent direct tax collection agency. The previously promulgated "Application Registration Method for Income Tax Paying Businesses and Residences" should be amended to comply. The Ministry has now formulated a "Application Registration Method for Business Premises of Profitable Businesses and Freelancers," and has abolished the "Application Registration Method for Income Tax Paying Businesses and Residences." The main points of the "Application Registration Method for Business Application and Registration of Profitable Businesses and Freelancers" are now recorded as follows: All newly opened, reorganized, merged, topped, newly established or surviving profitable businesses should apply for registration with the local competent collection agency within one month after the start of business, and issue an A-type income tax registration certificate. All business premises for freelance professions should apply for registration with the local competent collection agency within one month after the start of business, and issue a B-type income tax registration certificate. All current business premises for profitable businesses that perform business or freelance professions whose whereabouts are unknown must be registered in accordance with the provisions of this method within one month from the date of promulgation of this method.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Electrically Requests the Legislative Yuan to Consider Reducing the Business License Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, stating briefly that according to letters from the Municipal Automobile Transportation Business Association and other associations, after reading the newspaper reports, the revised and passed Use License Tax Law by the Legislative Yuan has increased the tax rate by more than thirty times compared to that stipulated in the tax law of December 4, 1946. Such a multiple tax increase is unprecedented. During the Anti-Japanese War, transportation merchants suffered great losses and have not yet recovered. They already feel heavily burdened by the various taxes and levies they pay at ordinary times, and they are already struggling to maintain their business in the face of business depression and difficult circumstances. How can they bear further tax burdens? For the sake of the survival of all members, the Chamber of Commerce cannot remain silent. It dares to express its urgent words and respectfully requests your council to promptly submit the actual situation to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. Grant consideration and reduction of the revised tax rate for use licenses to show courtesy and avoid hardship. The Chamber is extremely hopeful. The Chamber of Commerce has calculated and considered the aforementioned letters from the public association, and believes that the aforementioned tax rate is more than thirty times higher than the current tax law. The burden is heavy, and the results are still transferred in a cycle to consumers. The Chamber believes that the tax is no less than thirty times more than now and that the issues related to people's livelihood are too serious. The Chamber still requests your hospital to seriously consider and reduce the burden on the people in accordance with the two Western Yang and Western Geng generations of this Chamber and the sections presented in this telegram.</p>
<h3>The Central Trust Bureau Promotes Spring Silk Exports, Hoping That All Silk Factories Will Deliver Goods Quickly</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is handling the work of purchasing spring silk. As of now, a total of 4,097 bales have been delivered by various manufacturers (each bale contains 133 and one-third pounds). Among them, there are 105 bales of grade A, 755 bales of grade B, 1,305 bales of grade C, 1,300 bales of grade D, 560 bales of grade E, 17 bales of 16-18 filament, 25 bales of 13-15 filament, and 30 bales of thrown silk. In order to earn foreign exchange, the Bureau has successively shipped 2,460 bales abroad. Among them, the United States and India account for the majority, each accounting for about 40%, and the rest are in Europe and other places. Recently, the Bureau sold another 300 bales to India, which are waiting to be shipped. In addition, it also plans to ship 800 bales to the United States and 1,500 bales to the Soviet Union before the end of the month. According to the current raw silk in hand, there are only 1,637 bales left. If all of them are shipped out, the shortage will be 963 bales. The Central Trust Bureau hopes that the factories will deliver the goods quickly so that they can be shipped on time.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Light and Heavy Industries Are Progressing Rapidly; Sugar Factories Will All Start Operations Soon; Taiwan Sugar Plans to Export 100,000 Tons Next Year</h3>
<p>Wu Zhaohong, Chief Secretary of the Resources Committee and Chairman of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, said before returning to Beijing via Shanghai: During this trip to Taiwan, the second joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the company was held, and the company's work plan and business budget for the next year have been finalized. Taiwan's grain industry has been actively reorganized and restored by the company for the past two years. The original 36 sugar factories can all start sugar production by the end of the year. The area planted with sugarcane has also increased from 30,000 acres to 89,000 acres, and will be further increased to 118,000 acres next year. Taiwan's farmers have benefited greatly from the company's implementation of the sugar distribution method, so they are very enthusiastic about planting sugarcane. Last year, the area planted with sugarcane has reached the original plan. The amount of fertilizer applied per acre has also gradually increased from 80 kg to about 400 kg. The warehouse area has built more than 200,000 square feet this year. The grain production season this year will begin next month. It is estimated that the output this season can reach 300,000 metric tons. Currently, Japan, Korea, the South Seas, and the Middle East all need sugar very much. In order to earn foreign exchange, we have negotiated with the Central Bank to increase export methods. It is expected that we plan to export 100,000 tons next year. The United Kingdom is now advocating famine exports. Although sugar is not an indispensable item for people's daily use, the Taiwan sugar produced in our country is of excellent quality. For the sake of the entire national economy, we should try our best to conserve consumption and increase the quantity of exports in order to increase foreign exchange income.</p>
<p>Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, and his party arrived in Shanghai by plane from Taipei a few days ago. According to Weng, the results of the inspection in Taiwan this time were quite satisfactory. All light and heavy industries have made considerable progress. For example, the output of sugar in the last season was more than 30,000 tons, and it can be increased to more than 300,000 tons in the next season. The Luodong Paper Mill produced 400,000 tons of paper last year, and it has increased to 1.1 million tons this year. In addition, such as cement, fertilizer, are also in mass production. There are also some new products, such as cars, diesel, oil, brake oil, etc., which were not produced before the war.</p>
<h3>The Pig Bristle Industry Has Initially Succeeded in Obtaining Loans from the Agricultural Bank</h3>
<p>The Pig Bristle Industry Association of this city convened a meeting in order to collect a large amount of raw materials this year in order to maintain its operations, and collected spot goods by district to pledge to the Farmers Bank for loans. According to Mr. Fei Meisheng, Director of the Association, the loan process has been quite smooth and has achieved initial success. Fei also said that this pledge of loan funds will benefit the industry. With this loan, a large amount of raw materials can be purchased in the place of origin. At the same time, the export can be maintained regularly in the international market without fear of interruption.</p>
<h3>Reduced Exports of Salt to Japan Replaced with Iron Sand</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] It is reported that after the Ministry of Economic Affairs learned that iron sand produced in Hainan Island was exported to Japan in exchange for locomotives, it ordered the Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to conduct a detailed survey of the supply and demand of raw materials in steel plants in Guangdong in order to consider the situation and give priority to supplying raw materials to domestic manufacturers and then exporting the surplus. According to the previous government decision to export iron sand to Japan, there were two main points: 1. Our country does not currently need this iron sand; 2. In the barter trade between China and Japan, Japan needs food, coal, and iron raw materials. Our country is not self-sufficient in grain and coal. In the past, salt exported to Japan was the main product. Due to the situation, the amount has been sharply reduced, and the amount exported to Japan is only one-eleventh of the original contract. Therefore, iron yarn has to be exported.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Porcelain Plans to Promote Sales to the United States</h3>
<p>Jiangxi porcelain was once famous in the world. In recent years, the business has declined due to the failure to improve the technology. Currently, Dali Import and Export Company has a lot of contact with the Jiangxi porcelain industry, and plans to promote the sales of Western-style porcelain to North and South America. However, in view of the fact that this market was previously estimated by Japan, in order to prevent the revival of Japanese porcelain dumping, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will be entrusted to investigate the situation of the Japanese porcelain industry. In addition, banks in Jiangxi do not operate foreign exchange business, and letters of credit can only be opened to Shanghai. The Jiangxi-Shanghai exchange rate is very high (currently 6%). The cost has increased and the procedures are complicated. Recently, the loan period for Japanese exports has suddenly been shortened from 90 days to 30 days, while the porcelain manufacturing kiln time is two months, and the Jiangxi-Shanghai transportation also takes one month, so the loan cannot be fully utilized. It is hoped that the competent authority will seek remedies as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cigarette market was characterized by nervousness on all sides. Furthermore, because money was tight, selling was incessant. Ten packs of Great Britain cigarettes fell 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Old Knife and Hade Men both fell 250,000 yuan. Merchants like British American Tobacco and Beauty Bank followed suit, falling 500 to 1,000 yuan per carton.</p>
<p>In terms of daily necessities, soap, because many bulls had closed their positions and sold off, and there were six batches of sales, the price was lower than the factory price, and sales were only four mouths in each star. As a result, Gu Ben soap fell another 10,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day, Jian Dao fell 6,000 yuan, and other soaps were flat. Ji brand candles fell slightly by 20,000 yuan, and matches also fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Tea Export Association to Convene General Meeting on Schedule to Discuss Tea Export Steps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tea Export Association believes that since the government opened up foreign exchange nearly two years ago, the export industry has been sluggish, and the difficulty of exporting tea is even more severe. Although it is due to the failure to improve quality as much as possible, other factors such as transportation, capital adjustment, and high costs affect tea exports. It is true that there are major problems. Now, the government is planning the balance of international payments, and it is time for export trade. My country's tea specialty is one of the main exports. In order to improve the tea export steps and cooperate with the government's export trade policy, the general meeting of members will be held on the 18th of this month. The City Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting to discuss the promotion of tea exports.</p>
<h3>World Rice Production Prospects This Year Slightly Higher Than Last Year, Still Less Than Pre-War Average</h3>
<p>According to the preliminary estimates of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, world rice production for the 1947-48 crop year will be approximately 695,000,000,000 bushels, slightly higher than last year but still 7% lower than the pre-war average. Rice production prospects are improving in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia excluding the Indian peninsula. Rice production in South America is somewhat uncertain due to timing issues, but it is not expected to be lower than last year.</p>
<p>Paddy fields in China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, and Malaysia have all increased, and the weather before harvesting is conducive to rice production. The total output of the three rice-surplus countries, Siam, Burma, and Vietnam, is expected to increase by 100,000,000,000 bushels compared to last year.</p>
<p>The area of ​​rice cultivation in Burma has been increased by 10,000 acres, but the floods in August have caused great damage to the paddy fields. Rice production in Siam has suffered from drought during the transplanting period, which has hindered its maximum recovery. However, rice production is still expected to increase compared to last year. On the Vietnam side, due to the unstable situation, rice production is expected to decrease this year.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Indian Peninsula has 80,500,000 acres of paddy fields, and rice production is expected to be approximately 1,980,000,000 bushels in 1947-48. Last year, there were 81,800,000 acres, which produced 2,105,000,000 bushels. The increase in planting of hemp this year has resulted in a decrease in both the acreage and production of paddy fields.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the increase in rice production this year is: North America 6,000,000 bushels, Europe 7,000,000 bushels, Africa 2,000,000 bushels. The above bushel figures are all brown rice, not white rice.</p>

<h3>New Trends in Popular Education</h3>
<p>— Lu Cheng</p>
<p>Author: Gu Mei Publisher: China Book Bureau</p>
<p>How important is popular education to the construction of a new China! However, in the barren publishing industry, it is extremely difficult to find a book that can point out the trends in popular education and explain the correct path of popular education. Recently, we were fortunate enough to read Gu Mei's "New Trends in Popular Education."</p>
<p>Popular education in China has a history of several decades, and many books and newspapers discussing popular education have also been published. The more famous ones include Gan Yuyuan's "Popular Education" (Zhonghua), Meng Xiancheng's "Popular Education" (World Edition), Zhao Buxia's "Outline of Popular Education" (Zhonghua), Gao Jiansi's "Popular Education" (Commercial Press), Chen Lijiang's "Popular Education" (Commercial Press), and Yu Qingtang's "Popular Education" (Zhengzhong). These works have made some contributions to the development of popular education in China. However, after China experienced eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, especially the working masses, suffered unprecedented hardships. It should be very clear that popular education must change its direction of effort to shoulder the mission of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Gu, has been engaged in popular education for nearly twenty years and has a deep understanding and research of popular education. He is respected by colleagues in popular education. This book first observes the trends of popular education from the process of its development, then lists the implementation methods of various policies, and criticizes their gains and losses, so that those who study or manage popular education know what to take and what to discard. As stated in the preface: "This book describes the process of development of popular education, so that it can be clear about its changes before and after; changes are restricted by subjective and objective conditions and are not completely made out of thin air; personnel who handle popular education must deeply understand these conditions, and then they can grasp them, work hard to move forward, and embark on the bright road."</p>
<p>Popular education in China is of course particularly in need of promotion, but whether past popular education has been beneficial or harmful to the Chinese people is indeed something to be carefully considered. Mr. Gu reminds colleagues in popular education to pay attention to the subjective and objective conditions for the implementation of popular education, which is particularly earnest and deeply admired!</p>
<p>The book has seven chapters in total: What is Popular Education? The Content of Popular Education, Popular Supplementary Education, Comprehensive Popular Education, Separate Popular Education, New Developments in Popular Education, and Where is Popular Education Moving?</p>
<p>From these contents, this book has a complete system of popular education. The author praises this book because it has the following advantages:</p>
<p>It has profound and unique insights, especially pointing out the trends in popular education from the process of its development, without any prejudice, which is particularly commendable. For example, Mr. Gu pointed out that the reason why each family has different interpretations of popular education is that they have ignored the development process and the limitations of conditions. Therefore, in the section on the meaning of popular education, the author says: "Popular education at the present stage is the education that develops the lives of the people." This is such an appropriate and pertinent way to explain the meaning of popular education using dialectical methods.</p>
<p>Accurate to reality, and the argument does not advocate empty words: Mr. Gu is a simple and honest scholar. His arguments are always based on evidence, with no fabricated elements and no excessive prejudices. For example, Mr. Gu says in the section on the object of popular education: "Some people think that the object of popular education in China is the whole people, unconditionally saying that regardless of gender, occupation, wealth, social status, educated or uneducated, from national leaders to vendors and peddlers" are all objects of popular education. In fact, it is inevitable that the description is exaggerated and too grandiose." However, Mr. Gu pointed out that the object of popular education in China at the present stage should be all the working masses, especially the adult working masses, which is such a realistic statement.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, there are research and discussion questions, and these questions can make people think deeply, so that readers can have a deeper understanding of the content of the chapter, and for popular education workers, they also indicate the direction of their efforts.</p>
<p>From the preface, we know that this book was written by the author after the War of Resistance Against Japan in those years when life was most difficult. At that time, the author was trapped in Shanghai (then called the isolated island), and the suffering of life was unimaginable. However, Mr. Gu was able to engage in writing this book during his spare time from teaching, which is particularly precious. From time to time, pessimistic and negative arguments are revealed in the article, which shows how bad the author's mood was at that time and how tragic the situation was! However, because this book is the child of a crisis, it is even more great!</p>
<h3>Math is Fun</h3>
<p>— Zhong Huan</p>
<p>Written by Liu Xunyu Published by Kaiming</p>
<p>For higher algebra, the most common textbook is Fan's Higher Algebra, and the best reference book is Horner's Higher Algebra and Ueno Kiyoshi's Lecture Notes on Higher Algebra. Fan's compilation is suitable, while Horner and Ueno's books excel in exercises. The special feature of "Math is Fun" introduced here is "clear explanation." The author, Mr. Liu Xunyu, uses a fluent and relaxed style, and simple theories to explain profound theories, and bases his explanations on things in daily life, unlike the boring and tasteless nature of ordinary math books.</p>
<p>The content of this book is roughly the same as that of Horner's, including arrangement and combination, the solution of indefinite equations, the problem of product bombs, advanced arithmetic series, and numeration methods. The selection of materials is novel. For example, the discussion of the problem of product bombs starts with selling soup, and the discussion of probability starts with playing mahjong, which naturally arouses interest and makes people concentrate. It is a good reference book and also a beneficial novel.</p>
<p>As for applications, I think it should be used together with Horner's, because Horner's seems too deep, and there is still no good translation, so in terms of theory, we use "Math is Fun" to supplement the deficiencies of Horner's, but "Math is Fun" does not have exercises, so we still have to rely on Horner's to help, so that they can complement each other.</p>
<p>The price of this book is not high. A novel of the same thickness may be more expensive than it, so I advise high school students to buy a copy, which can be used as a reference book and also as a novel.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy and Life</h3>
<p>— Lin Houlun</p>
<p>(By G. Gamow, translated by Chen Zhongjie and Shu Chongze, "Atomic Energy and the Universe and Life," published by Commercial Press, priced at 15,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>Since the victory, the number of new books published by various bookstores cannot be considered small. However, popular science books like "Atomic Energy and the Universe and Life" seem quite rare. Here, we must admire the vision of the Commercial Press authorities and the efforts of the two translators. Thanks to their sacrifice, the Chinese people have gained a genuine opportunity to increase their knowledge.</p>
<p>G. Gamow is a professor at the University of Washington in the United States. He played an important role in the US military's research on atomic energy, making significant contributions to the theory and technology of liberating atomic energy. It seems like a "waste of talent" for him to write this small book with the knowledge he gained from his research. However, this also becomes the biggest regret of the whole book: it cannot yet become a "popular science book that everyone can understand." Inevitably, there are many parts in the book that are a bit too profound. Although the fluent writing style has made up for some of it, it still needs to remove a few pages of profound descriptions to be considered a popular science book that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>Several illustrations and photos in the book are very interesting and meaningful. Especially the first photo, which has a great allegorical meaning: atomic energy was quietly discovered, and in less than fifty years, it has been vigorously developed, destroying a large city in one fell swoop. The progress of physics in the past fifty years is astonishing.</p>
<p>However, the praiseworthy aspects of the book are not limited to some photos and illustrations. It can be considered very appropriate to use this book as a reference book for high school students. Recently, many parts of high school courses require explanations of atomic structure. In those profound and obscure texts, it is quite difficult to specifically understand the atomic structure and shape. It is even more difficult to understand how the energy contained within the atom can be liberated. However, in this book, it uniquely explains it using the surface energy of a drop of water, which is both concrete and easy to understand, and is ten thousand times clearer than the explanation in textbooks.</p>
<p>After Professor G. Gamow finished explaining the analogy of atomic structure and the principle of liberating atomic energy, he went on to a narrative from the ends of the earth to write the second chapter of the book. This chapter talks about the origin of us humans, the origin of the earth, how the sun is produced, the Milky Way in which the solar system is entrusted, the nebulae outside the Milky Way, and even the relationship between that large area outside the clouds and the small atoms. The original description is so beautiful, and the expression of the translation is even more full of literary atmosphere. This chapter is probably the most attractive part of the whole book for readers. The origin of humans, the origin of the earth... this series of questions is what everyone wants to know, and this book can actually write it in words that everyone can understand. Although it does not make much contribution to pure academics, it is very valuable in terms of popularizing science and arousing people's interest in science.</p>
<p>After talking about the relationship between atoms and the universe, we will talk about atomic energy and life. This issue becomes the third chapter of the book. The first half of the third chapter is very specialized and inappropriate, and ordinary middle school students in our country cannot understand it, while science and engineering college students already understand it. Only the last section of the chapter seems to be of general interest. It tells us about many uses of atomic energy and future prospects.</p>
<h3>Biography of Madame Curie</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Zhengren, published by World Book Company</p>
<p>Radium is the most mysterious and rare thing in the world. The discoverer of radium is the Polish female scientist Madame Curie. I think everyone is very familiar with this name. This book is about the life of Madame Curie.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into twenty-eight chapters: the first chapter talks about the hatred of Poland's subjugation. At that time, Poland was under the sphere of influence of Russia. The second chapter introduces radioactive elements. The third chapter talks about her childhood. Her father was a teacher, and she had three older sisters and one older brother. From the fourth to the eighth chapter is her school days, "Among this class, Marie (Madame Curie's former name) was the youngest, but in all subjects, she always ranked among the best and was the champion of her classmates." It can be seen that she was very smart and hardworking at that time. After middle school, her family did not go to university due to financial difficulties. She worked as a tutor for several years. Xu Lai was helped by her third sister before she went to Paris to study at university. After the tenth chapter, it talks about the process of her and Mr. Curie extracting pure radium after their marriage. At first, their economy was very difficult, and they did not have money to buy raw materials. They used a factory shed as a laboratory. After they discovered radium, they won several bonuses and gradually became famous. Later, after Mr. Curie passed away, she became a female professor. The United States sent her two grams of radium. She gave one gram to France and one gram to her motherland. Later, her body gradually weakened due to hard work. She died in Sancerre on July 4 of the year she was sixty-seven years old (1934).</p>
<p>The last chapter is the conclusion. Einstein said, "Among all the celebrities, the only one who was not overwhelmed by fame was Madame Curie." Madame Curie's door-knocking, hard work, and finally achieved the result and gained great reputation. But she herself was not proud at all. She worked for the sake of work!</p>
<h3>"The Art of Poetry"</h3>
<p>— Hu Jide</p>
<p>Written by Li Guangtian, published by Kaiming Bookstore. "The Art of Poetry" and Ai Qing's "On Poetry" can be said to be two relatively perfect treatises in the new poetry world. The former is half theory and half criticism, while the latter focuses entirely on theory. This is the difference between the two books.</p>
<p>The articles in "The Art of Poetry" are not divided into chapters and sections or have a systematic nature. The Taoer collection contains five articles, all written one after another. "The Art of Poetry" is also one of them and is used as the title of the book. Now, the characteristics of this book are briefly described on the left to introduce it to young readers who love new poetry. (As the author said, "Young people with enthusiasm are all a poem. It is most hygienic for young people to use poetry to vent their emotions." Then let us appreciate the art of this poem!)</p>
<p>Analysis of the Prose of New Poetry: Since the New Culture Movement, new poetry has been liberated from the old shackles and restrictions. It stands to reason that the beginning of a new era. Every time is the day when poetry blooms. The examples of Goethe and Schiller in Germany are well known. In France, during the era of the Great Revolution, many great poets were produced, which is the reason. However, the path of our Chinese new poetry is still being developed in thorns. The author points out in the first article that the current poetry is prose poetry, and has not yet crossed into the ideal realm. However, with so many readers supporting it, the future development is still optimistic, and it is mentioned in the article that: "In the past, bookstore owners shook their heads when they saw new poetry, but now, businessmen's abacuses are also hitting this stroke quite loudly." New poetry has not entered a stage of superiority, and the author analyzes it in detail in the book, let me excerpt a few sentences here: "In response to the current trend of prose in poetry, we just say that poets should always create (or use) various different forms themselves, and do not ignore the form, in order to perfectly convey those thoughts, feelings, or "complete experiences" that are worthy of poetry, and to improve them."</p>
<p>Discussion of Form and Content: Poetry becomes prose, and then it involves the issue of form and content. He (hereinafter refers to the author himself) said: "I believe that "content determines form", therefore, I also believe that content has a superiority over form." "Paying attention to form does not mean ignoring content, but to improve content." In the second article, he takes the criticism of Xia Zhilin's "Ten Years of Poetry Drafts" as an example, and discusses chapters, syntax, format, and rhyme in all aspects. It is definitely not a superficial theory for readers. Similarly, it also shows us the attitude of studying new poetry.</p>
<p>Careful Criticism of Word Usage: "The poet's voice is our voice, the voice of the times. The poet breathes for us, speaks for us, and shines." Then, since poetry represents people's voices, why should we "bite words" and ponder? We can find the answer to this question in the book. "Life comes first. Art comes second. Only those who are faithful to life can be artists and can be faithful to art." Poetry has its depth in the artistic techniques and essence, so no matter a word or a phrase is never sloppy. From the fourth article criticizing Fang Jing's poems, he explains the height of the tone by using the single words "呢", "吗", and "哪". Obviously, he has unique insights into the careful study of word usage. This is enough to warn the efforts of people who study new poetry.</p>
<p>Indicating the Path for Learners: In the last article, he indicates the path for young authors who study new poetry, and the shortcomings that should be corrected. The method of learning is compared to a tree, "Wildness is the wanton growth of a small tree; cleanliness is when you prune it and tidy it up; but this pruning and this tidying is precisely for it to grow more like it, and it will have a very substantial completion." This indicates the problem that learners are not "clean" when writing poetry; and warns every young learner against the taboos of the "exhibitionist" and "enthusiast" problems. Every sentence prescribes the right medicine, which is definitely not without benefit to us.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox</h3>
<p>To Mr. Ding Xingjian of Shanghai: Money shops that closed down due to the Anti-Japanese War can apply for resumption of business after the war. As for the money shops that declared closure in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was not due to the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, even for money shops that closed down due to the Anti-Japanese War, the period for applying for resumption of business has passed, and they cannot resume business again. If the money shop has already opened, it cannot apply to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. As for the dispute between the other two brothers over the eldest brother, it is a matter of equity within the money shop and can be filed in the district court.</p>
<p>To Mr. Ma Shujun of Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal Temporary Measures for the Management of House Rentals stipulate that house rentals cannot be calculated in kind. Those originally calculated in kind should be converted into legal tender based on the market price of the kind on the date of signing the lease.</p>
<p>To Mr. Chen Qingze of Shanghai: Should publish a notice to clarify the closure of the factory.</p>
<p>To Mr. Yan Jin of Shanghai: Hope to contact the community for this matter.</p>
<p>To Mr. Guyan Sujun of Wuxi: I understand your letter. It seems that you can submit your documents together and request the Party Department to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>To Mr. Ma of Hangzhou: Our meaning is to endure with age.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Menghua of Wujin: What these four words mean, there is no way to guess.</p>
<p>To Mr. Li Chenzhen of Taixing: I am unable to answer your inquiry on your behalf.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Baozhou of Shanghai: Hope to come and talk so that I can reply.</p>
