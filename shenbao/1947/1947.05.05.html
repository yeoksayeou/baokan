<h3>張羣談借款問題　平衡預算不能外債　對外貸欵必須用於建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕行政院院長張羣，前出席立法院會議報吿時，曾說及美國借款問題。今復應記者詢問，特再說明如次：「我政府應如何達到預算上之收支平衡，誠爲當前之重大難題；但此一難題之解決，政府應先實行自助政策，以逐漸增加稅收，減少不生產之支出，與內債等方法爲之。害人不能倚輯外債，以彌補預算上之超支，但我國現有廣大之區域，需要立即開始經濟復員工作與建設工作。此種工作所需之費用，自非我國庫現時能力所能負荷，於此則美國之借款，自關至要。政府對於此點，將嚴格依照此次參加政府各黨派所宣示之共同施政方針，即舉借外債，必須以用於建設與生產以及安定改善國民經濟生活爲限。</p>
<h3>美報評論　推崇張羣</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日電〕華盛頓每日新聞本日撰評稱，改組後中國政府行政院長張羣，現正以其自承困難之地位，從事一「良好之開始」。第一，張氏已偕其閣員出席立法院報告，且請立法院對其計劃，提出討論。此乃中國政府程序中一個新的令人鼓舞之轉變。第二，新院長在宣佈「我政府堅信吾人應以自力更生爲主，不宜專賴外來助力」一語時，頗具自恃之格調，此即表示有一種新的勇氣，注入國民黨政府中。該報認爲倘此即暗示蔣卞席之政府，已決宗藉健全之內部措施，穩定中國之經濟，則誠爲一好消息，且屬値得鼓舞者。中國之善後工作，無疑將需要若干外來援助，但如中國政府確能表現其貫澈其本身之建設改革計劃之有力，則外來援助，將更爲迅速有望。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日合衆電〕霍華德系報撰評論稱，中國行政院張院長出長重任以還，銳意圖新，渠已出席立法院，就其計劃有所報吿，同時張院長並表現其自信之能力，此可顯示新動力，已注入中國政府。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城對記者談　改組後國內局勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕吳秘書長鐵城，日昨來滬，中央社記者訪詢政府改組後情形，承吿如次：　擴大政府　礎，從政治協商會議至今一年有餘，卒底於成。國民黨固然欣慰，全國人民及友邦想亦同感興奮。此一年來各方面商談之周折，當爲國人所共知。中國共產黨拒絕參加政府，不願意共同促成民主憲政，最後並否認憲法，用武力破壞和平，實爲一大憾事！</p>
<p>當前中國之經濟間題及中國共產黨武裝反抗政府問題，在國民政府改組以後與參加政府之各黨派一致勞力，當可籌謀妥善解決辦法。經濟問題之解決，固然需要友帮助，主要仍在自力更生，能自助者，人必助之。</p>
<p>今日中國惟一出路；第一在培養民主政治基礎，實施憲政，故今年政府最繁重之工作，爲舉辦各種選舉，如期召開國民大會，成立憲政政府。第二，在用迅速有效方法，促使中國共產黨停止軍事行動，完全恢復交通，必須共產黨變爲普通合法之政黨與國民黨及其他黨派共同努力，達成中國之和平統一，中國方能在　政常軌中積極進行各種改革及建設。人民始得安居樂業。</p>
<p>中國之安定繁榮與世界之安定繁榮，有密切關係。國際間之安寗和平，亦與中國之安寗和平有密切關係。中國爲善盡其國際間一員之責任，自必先求本國之和平統一，雖然茲事禮大，精誠所至，終有完全達到目的之一日，而其成功之主要條件，則在全體國民有信心。能忍耐，並具有大毅力。</p>
<p>最後記者叩詢吳氏對中共地下鬥爭綱領之感想，吳氏答稱，此係中共一貫之作風，不値驚異。</p>

<h3>社論　國府還都一週年</h3>
<p>今天是國民政府凱旋還都的一週紀念日，回想起一年前的今天，全國的人民沉醉在光榮的勝利裏，慶祝國府還都的情緒，是何等的熟烈！對於還都後國內政治的期望，又是何等的迫切！但是一年後的今天，緬懷過去，光榮的勝利之果，業已腐爛乾凈；瞻望將來，風雨如晦；所以今天我們來紀念這個凱旋還都的偉大日子，眞是感想萬千。</p>
<p>第一，政局的明朗與憲政的實施，尙有待全國朝野的加倍努力。一年前的今天，正在政治協商會圓滿閉幕之後，其所通過的和平建國綱領以及軍隊的整編統編方案，雖然尙未開始實施，但是和談在盟國調人的斡旋之下進行，使國府還都成爲和平建國的開端，仍有極大的希望。無如中共迷信武力萬能，欲以武力擴大其地盤，始終不悟，以致全國所期望的和談，若隱若現，造成打打談談，談談打打的局勢，終使百折不撓的調人馬歇爾元帥，也束手無策，不得不自認失敗而悄然返國，從此和談一直未能恢復。這一段和談的經過，可以說是最令人傷心和失望的事。不過從另一個角度去看，政府爲了和平，不惜對中共一再忍讓，和談的破裂，其咎不在政府，應由中共負全部責任；同時政府爲了民主，處處發揮盡其在我的精神，不顧中共及民盟的阻撓，仍依照原定的計劃，按步就班。踏上準備實施憲政的大道，去年十一月國民大會的召開以及新憲法的制定，無論如何解釋，終不能不說是政府還都後致力於政治民主化的一大成就。不寗唯是，抑且政府爲了確保實施憲政的成功起見，又自動改組政府，延攬民靑兩黨以及社會賢達參加，以擴大政府的民主基礙，且已於前月改組成功。新任行政院長張羣，以新政治家的風度，出而秉政，揭示其今後施政原則，一日試行行政院對立法院負責之制；二曰仍循政治途徑解瘊中共問題；頓使國內政局面目一新，因此在全國人昆的心頭，又發生了無限的希望。惟由我們看來，現在人民對於今後政治所懷有的希望，仍屬渺茫，尙有待全國朝野的加倍努力，尤其是中共的翻然覺悟，立即放下武器，使全國化干戈爲玉帛，從此國內政局就可以明朗，至今年十二月廿五日開始行憲，也就會開出民主之花來。</p>
<p>第二，軍隊國家化應不惜任何代價，務使其實現。在一年前國府還都時，全國人民莫不渴望國內和平的實現；而且一致相信，實施軍隊的整編及統編方案，使全國的軍隊國家化，誠爲保特國內和平統一的最佳辦法；所以國人無時無刻不期待軍隊的國家化。但是時至如今，不僅這個希望幻滅了；而且戰亂的烽火，遍及了半個中國，華北，東北，蘇北，陝北以及魯豫晋等省，均竹遭到中共割據稱雄的茶毒；中共在軍事上雖經一再敗北，連其作爲「中共區」發使號令的延安，也被國軍收復，但是中共的迷夢，至今尙未淸醒；而且將其一切的希望，寄托在其游擊戰略上，而痴心妄想，欲在經濟上拖倒國民政府；因此國內戰亂一時尙無結束的希望，全國軍隊的國家化，此際更加談不到。我們固然也承認政府對中共用兵。是出之於不得已；因爲政府對於國內交通的保持，以及人民生命財產的保護，責無旁貸，故對於以武力破壞交通擾亂治安的中共，自不能熟視無睹，而不得不斷然行動，俾使國人得以安居樂業；但是我們仍舊希望政府對於軍事，能有整個計劃。務須於最短期內使國內恢復和平，切實履行軍隊的國家化，從此國內永久可以保持和平與統一。</p>
<p>第三，政府在經濟上應以安定民生第一為原則。全國人民在八年血戰中不是隨軍輾轉，顚沛流離；淪落四方；就是留在淪陷區受盡敵僞的宰割，呻吟憔悴，痛苦不堪言狀。誰不希望至抗戰勝利之後能减輕生活上的痛苦…故在去年國府還都時，全國人民莫不吩望政府在經濟財政上有所作爲，以蘇民困；但是一年來，因爲財政上的不能平衡，通貨膨脹無法避免，以致物價飛漲，使老百姓在饑餓綫上掙扎，大有惶惶然朝不保夕之勢。其受生活壓迫的痛苦，甚至超過戰時生活！這種危險的情形，若不設法挽救，則其後患所及，將不堪設想。張院畏最近亦已向立法院坦白承認「目前經濟極爲困難，影響國計民生甚鉅，當力求收支平衡。』並表示經濟問題應以經濟方法解決，足見政府當局也正在注意着當前的國計民生，但是我們不能不指出物價瘋在飛漲，對於人民生計威脅的嚴重，實超過水災或火災，而抑制物價的漲風，有如救火救命，首在迅赴事機，立即行動，如果見災不救，退而從長研究救災辦法，不免失之太晚。老實說，經濟困難的情形，旣已發展到這種嚴重的地步，一切諱言和掩飾，都不能勝過於事實；政府當局唯有正視現實，面對困難，力行切實具體的辦法。英國政府應付經濟困難的辦法，最値得我們的參考。今後一切行政設施，均應以安定民生第一爲最高指導原則。應節省一切縻費，栽汰一切冗員，提高行政效率，即使是應興應革的事項，也要分一個緩念，凡與安定民生無關的事項，都可以暫　進行；至於對於漲無止境的物價，更應採取大力闊斧的辦法，實行經濟的新政。一切措施，應以統計數字爲依據，茍欲加以管制，就應該力求其徹底，不達目的不止，非使其奏效不可。</p>
<p>要之，今天是國府還都後的一週年，過去種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生，展望國內政治的前途，雖然樂觀的成分少，而可悲觀的地方多，但是事在人爲，全國人民仍希望改組後的政府，能以新政府的新作風，打開當前在政治上經濟上的困難。</p>

<h3>法議會舉行重要表決　通過信任政府案　共黨議員均投不信任票　總理今後動向殊堪注目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：賴瑪迪政府今日在法議會贏得信任票之巨大勝利，但共黨最後一分鐘之反對政府決定，已預示聯合內閣將實行改組。法議會今日之票數，經揭露如次：信任票三百六十票，反對票一百八十六票，棄權者爲六十三票。議員大多數表示擁護，但賴瑪迪仍起立要求共黨表明態度。賴氏稱：「我人必須有明白之決定，君等若反對本人，祈勿投信任票，法國目前面對嚴重之困難，祗有實施鐵一般之紀律，始能挽回危局。」賴氏辭畢，共黨一致投不信任票，但其他各黨則支特賴瑪迪。今日之結果，證明賴瑪迪祇有兩條途徑可循：其一爲以其他各黨人物代替担任谷部長之共黨黨負，其二即爲提出總辭職。目前賴氏將採何種步驟，尙未決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕法國國會今最將面臨一可能引起共黨與法國其他黨分手之表決。賴瑪迪總理要求對其物價工資政策提信任票，其幕後之意義乃爲除共產黨以外之政黨是否準備摒棄共黨之參加及共黨所控制工會之支持，而實行治國。法國如成立並無共黨參加之聯合政府，將爲一九四四年解放以來之破題兒第一遭。此項嘗試，無疑當爲法國政治動盪時期之前奏。共黨對於各大工會具有强大之控制權，且準備領導工會要求提高工資。反對共產黨之高工資政策者則謂爲過止通貨膨脹維持現有幣値起見，至少在目前階段工資水準應予凍結。在經濟問題之後，共黨與他黨就外交政策意見亦復懸殊。共黨對他黨領袖之自莫斯科會議以來，愈益親英美而遠蘇聯，深感不滿。雖然，四黨聯合政府之保持，或尙有最後之一綫希望，社會黨尤不願造成全面性之內閣危機。議會社會黨人士今日竟日硏究使金屬工人得以在不違凍結茲本工資之原則下，獲得較佳待遇之妥當辦法，而急進黨，戴高樂派及人民共和黨，包括外長皮杜爾在內，則堅決反對與共產黨妥協。彼等認爲金屬工會要求增加生產獎金，並不與生產量之增加相符實爲變相的要求增加工資。此外急進黨並認現政府尙朱能予自由令業以足量之自由，故灤盼改組政肘，排除內閣之主要設計者，社會黨之國家經濟部長斐列浦。若千法國報紙指出目前之政府危機，已暴露憲法上若干奇特的弱點。共產黨今日當拒絕對政治之經濟政策投信任票，然政府仍可獲得多數之信任票。同時共黨閣員又表示不論表決結果如何，彼等不擬辭職，而賴瑪迪總理亦無方法可以强迫共黨閣員之去職。因此賴馬迪祗能率領全體閣員辭職。故法政府之辭職，皆因議會大多數通過對政府信任票之故，此項現象，在世界堪稱絕無僅有云。</p>
<h3>法共黨闡明立塲　擁護工會要求反對「武力政策」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三日電〕法國共產黨中央委員會頃發表宣言，訓令國民議會共黨議員擁護工會所提之加薪要求及反對在法蘭西聯邦內繼續推行「武力政策」，並主張大事裁减軍費，以平衡國家預算，及推行使法國可以獲得魯爾煤斤與賠償之外交政策。最後復對一九四六年十一月選舉後之情形表示失望，認爲違犯民主法規，致未能組成代表民意與共黨所領導之政府。宣言內容略謂：政府抑低物價之努力已吿失敗，但法國需爲人民謀衣食住之要求，並需穩定法郞價値，國家預算。尤需大事裁减軍費，使之平衡。以言外交政策，法國應建立永久與公正之和平，謀取賠償與魯爾煤斤之權利。關於帝國本身則宜終止武力政策，以免被某種帝國主義所乘，致使法蘭西聯邦四分五裂。務望共黨議員一致堅持此態度，在議會照此立塲投票。中央委員會繼又敦促社會黨工人與之聯合一致，反對反動勢力。並謂：勞工階級行動一致，始能成爲共和國全面統一之決定因素。中央委員會最後復籲請其他各黨加倍努力，共謀國家之復興，人民之福利，保障民主政治及法國之獨立云。</p>
<h3>德境美當局不准　另組計會統一黨</h3>

<h3>英蘇貿易談判　已獲若干進展</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科三日電〕英蘇貿易談判進行已有兩週，茲悉英代表團已決定展期一週　國，以與蘇當局繼續談判，良以談判頗有進展，故英方殊不欲使其中斷也。據悉英代表團雖不致即將議定之貿易協定携返本國，但必能依據一九三四年協定之基礎，建立恢復英蘇貿易之廣大原則。迄至目前，談判僅限於雙方擬行供給之物品，以及與訂立航運契約有關之技術問題。</p>
<h3>聨大政治委會今日商計　調查團組織問題　猶代表出席大公案未獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約三日電〕聨合國特別大會政治委會五日開會時，將討論巴勒斯坦調査乘會之設立及其權力定義，此兩議題迫使各代表涉及巴勒斯坦問題之核心。政治委會有兩項問題須待解決，其一設立調査委會，準備報吿書，俾於本年元月間向聯大例會提出之。其二，准許猶太公會代表陳述意見。第一點較第二點尤爲重要，因其牽涉整個巴勒斯坦問題，各代表團雖努力避免全面討論，但似屬難以兜出此圈子。各代表雖欲界予調查委會以廣大權力，但對其紙織則意見紛歧。目前有兩種主張，一派贊成調査委會由中立國委員組成之，所謂中立國即並不直接關係此一問題之國家，五强及阿拉伯各國不在其列。另一派主張五强與阿拉伯各國代表一併包括在內。美國贊成前一種主張，英國可望與美國亦步亦趨。各小國則反對，認爲巴勒斯坦問題最後非五强解決不可，五强倘包括在調査委會之內，可以預先解決若干困難問題，蘇聯與法國贊成此種主張。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三日電〕聯合國特別大會今日下午辯論猶太代表對巴勒斯坦問題應否蒞會陳述意見一案，歷四小時無結果，美蘇二國鑿枘殊甚·美國主張猶太代表僅可在政治委員會中，參加巴勒斯坦問題之辯論，蘇聯則力言猶太代表可在全體大會中發言。會議於下午六時半即吿散會，仍有照預定計劃準備發表意見之代表八人未及發言，但贊成與反對之論，早在指導委會上完全表明。主席亞朗哈希望在本晚重行會議，務使獲致決議案，但爲遵從大多數代表之願望起見，遂吿休會至五日晨十一時再行討論。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯談稱，聽取猶太代表之陳述，可增加大會之尊嚴，「吾人如欲獲得公正之決定，非使猶太代表出席全體大會不可」。</p>
<h3>聨大舉行歡迎會　墨總統演說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社林魯辛草地三日電〕墨西哥總統亞里曼，前來美國聘問，業已抵此。聯大會本日特爲其舉行歡迎會。亞里曼總統在大會主席亞朗哈致歡迎辭之後，發表演說稱，吾人唯有互相合作，始能克服戰後所發生之各種困難，並能使今日不安定之時期，變爲眞正的和平。要之，余希望諸君討論各項問題時，常能以和諧與正義爲指導原則云。</p>
<h3>英擬建築戰艦　用原子能作動力</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕海軍部今日宣佈：政府即將設法建造原子能推進之戰鬥艦，並擬展開大規模硏究工作，以維海軍效率。本年度各式海軍硏究耗帑當達二千四百萬美元之譜。海軍設務須應用比基尼原十彈試騐中觀察家習知之敎訓，但原子能之底蘊快不限制海軍於防守方面。譽初印象適得其反，而將引起增加海軍力量，形式高度革新，攻防任務益見擴大。原子能推進之戰鬥艦無加油問題，且其駐留海上之時間僅受其他次要之供應問題所限制。同時供應部宣佈，北愛爾蘭斯伯林費茲地方國營原子能工廠中即將開辦學校，訓練十四歲以上少年從事原子工作。</p>
<h3>英造船計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三百電〕海運能力已較美國落後之英國，正圖急起直追，以恢復其世界第一海運國之寳座。除向國外訂造者外，英本國船搗本年度造船目標爲一百二十五萬噸。燃料危機及鋼鐵木材之缺乏，對於造船計劃不免稍有影響，惟减少之數量，目前尙不能估計。今年之產量除四分之一外，均將加入英國之商船隊，目前後者之總噸位已退至僅佔全世界噸位之百分之廿四，計二千四百〇〇九千六百噸，美國之商船總噸位則爲五千〇三十八萬九千噸。英國目前向美所租商輪，計有二百二十九艘，英政府已決定費美匯一億元，收買其中之一百四十二艘。就噸位方面言，固尙需許多年，始能使英國重佔世界第一海運國之王座，但英國商船之配備，則莫不精益求精。</p>

<h3>回盟堅持分治　印度統一無望　伊斯梅返英促政府有及時行動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕星期泰晤士報新德里記者稱：據自極高當局探悉，印督蒙巴頓高級僚屬伊斯梅勳爵之赴倫敦，意在促英內閣及時行動，以免印度行政之全面崩潰，印度事務部恐猶不知在明年六月英國退出印度以前，印度即不免陷入混亂狀態，印督之報吿，遂特別提出國大黨與回盟絕無成立有關印度統一協議之可能。回盟要求之獨立國，包含信地，西北邊省，本哲布，俾珞支，孟加拉，阿薩密等六省，然國大黨則不欲出讓非由回敎徒佔大多數之阿薩密，本哲布東部及孟加拉西部。在西北邊省，國大黨或能讓步，因此印度總督希望在爭執區舉行公民投票，以定誰屬，承認巴基斯坦已引起繼續分治之若干要求。印督相信政權之移交早日實行，則此等要求之支持力必能較小，關於稅收移民及軍隊，勢非在數年以內不能分立，故印督建議由巴基斯坦及印度斯坦任命委員會，接收此等事務之過渡行政，以準備最後之分立，回盟若僅獲不完整的巴基斯坦，預料必將發動長期鬥爭，以收復被分割之母國。反之，若獲完整之巴基斯担，則國大黨亦必不甘心，在此等情形下，雙方實力當不能集中於農工社會制度之復典矣。在此等意見之發展下，遂有人建議應由英內閣考慮由英美蘇共同保證印度之主權。</p>

<p>（一）商店倒閉</p>
<p>李之君問　鄙人遭某商店倒閉，損失頗鉅，該店主已潛逃無踪，僅存其所租店面一間，及少數生財什物，請問（一）可否控以欺騙罪？（二）該店生有組產一份可否請求將其抵償債款？（三）鄙人僅執有該店收貨回單可否作為債權人之憑證？</p>

<p>（二）</p>
<p>繆紹海問　我有一個哥哥已婚，生性放蕩。不務正業，且有嗜好。父親屢勸不聽，有一次我哥哥酒醉，手　利斧欲劈死父親。幸父親逃避得法，未　毒手。於是他們二人間，便　下了不能消　的仇恨。在八年前的某一天晚上，我的哥哥被人謀害，我的父親涉嫌逃避在外，每天過着惶恐的生活。現在事隔八年，家嫂是否仍有追訴權？又國府頒大赦令，家父之嫌疑罪是否亦能免除？</p>
<p>〔端森愷律師簽〕令尊敎唆他人而殺死令兄觸犯刑法第二十九條之敎唆殺人罪。依同法第二百七十一條第一項殺人者處死刑，無期徒刑或十年以上有期徒刑。按之國府所頒大赦令丙項之規定死刑减爲有期徒刑十五年；無期徒刑减爲有期徒刑十年；十年以上有期徒刑减爲五年以上有期徒刑；並不完全赦免。故法院仍可行使職權訴追及審判，至今令嫂依法定程序，請求法院懲兇亦法之所許。如以不法手段爲報復，則應負法律上責任。</p>

<h3>本報五次特別廣播　張道藩演講　闡述五四運動對政治文化意義　希望「作協」供給良好精神食糧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報第五次星期特別廣播，昨日假座西藏路東方華美廣播電台舉行，請中央委員張道藩氏演講「紀念五四運動及上海文藝作家協會成立之意義。」茲誌演詞全文如下：</p>
<p>「今天是五四運動紀念日，廿八年以前，北平發生愛國學生運動，本來是一種政治運動，其後發展爲文化運動，與文藝有很大的關係。五四運動時提出兩句口號；要民主！要科學！因爲那時候政治全在專制狀態，學術文化更是談不到，國家旣貧且弱，所以才有這愛國遝動的發生，要求政治民主化，提倡科學，迎頭趕上。現在我們想一想廿八年來政治民主化的進展，感到很大的安慰。在五四運動以後，經過全國各地民衆的努力，尤其在國民黨領導之下，先後有護法之役及民國十五年的北伐，消滅軍閥，統一中國。</p>
<p>政治民主今已現實</p>
<p>那時候本有很好的機會即可實現民主，但因國內共產黨搗亂，盤踞皖贛一帶，陰謀赤化，唆使暴動，以致迫使政府不得不從事戡亂，不能走上建設的道路。其後九一八事變發生，日本軍閥爲阻止中國統一，發動事變，當時國力疲弱，軍事上毫無準備，祗得今垢忍辱，與敵拖延，以求多多準備，直至忍無可忍，退無可退，遂發動七七全面抗戰，經八年戰爭，終於獲得最後勝利。本來國民黨爲實現民主，戰前早在黨綱中規定軍政。訓政。憲政三時期，可是訓政時期因被敵人搗亂，可以說並未完成。現在勝利一年多後，因爲有提前實行憲政的必要，已於去年召集國民大會，制定憲法，俟今年國大選舉以後，即可行憲，而最近政府的改組，其目的亦是爲提前實現憲政。凡此種種事實，都足以說明五四運動所提出的「政治民主化」現在已有結果。</p>
<p>發展文藝更應重視</p>
<p>至於科學方面，雖然還趕不上歐美各國，但亦已有不少進步。其次再談到由五四運動展開的文化運動，文化中文藝是主要部門，應特別重視，現在聯合國有一敎育文化科學的組織，其中文化部門亦注重於文藝，所以文藝的發展不單求之於國內，更須求之於國外，以爭取民主國家對我的重視。抗戰時期，文藝界已有相當進展，並有各種組織，現在戰事結束，在建國過程中，不能忽略文藝這一環，需要我們更加勞力。目前國內文藝水準尙不能令人滿意，如小說電影等，雖有相當進步，但如詩歌等成績太差。若再與歐美各國比較，更覺瞠乎其後，所以如何求文藝發展，使已成名作家不單在國內成名，在國際亦能享名，如何使靑年作家得成名作家的掖助，亦能有所成就，這不僅靠政府幫助，社會同情，尤其賴自身努力。因此就有組織團體的必要，以朮互相幫助，五相切磋觀摩，而謀大家的福利。</p>
<p>文藝協會意義重大</p>
<p>現在聯合國的文化組織，發動參加的每一國家，在國內成立一委員會，由健全的文藝組織組成，像美國有一千餘個之多，中國過去談不到有健全的組織，前年始在重慶成立文協總會，勝利後遷至南京，今年第一屆年會時決定在上海設立文藝作家協會，因爲上海是全國文化的重心，更需要有此組織，以團結優秀作家。「上海文協」經過相當時期的籌備以後，才在今天正式成立。今天是五四紀念日，是由政治遝動轉變成文化運動的紀念日，因此特別具有意義，希望社會重視此一組織，以種種方法來扶助來　勵文藝與文藝作家的發展。尤有進者文藝作家是精神食糧的供給者，人不論貧富男女老幼，對於精神食糧同感需要，但精神食糧的好壞大有分別，除去少數作家別有用心別有目的者不論外，精神食糧之好者，能裨益人的身心修養，有毒素的，或者是低級趣味誨淫誨盜的，則不僅無益，抑且有害，所以希望文藝作家要拿出好的精神食糧來，而社會讀者則要有淸楚的認識，予不良的文藝作品以嚴格的妣評，嚴厲的打擊，以使文藝走上良好發展的道路，配合今後建國的重任。</p>

<h3>在結束了八年抗戰的大時代裏　怎樣做一個建國青年</h3>
<p>— 周緝熙</p>
<p>富强民主的新中國，能不能在這大時代裏，建設完成？這完全要看我們這一輩靑年，有沒有强健的體格，有沒有高尙的人格，有沒有科學的知能，以及有沒有民主的修養。如果我們全國靑年，人人具有上面所說的條件，那就人人都配稱爲建國靑年。嶄新的現代化的東亞大國，一定能在我們的手裏，建設起來，富強起來。所以，我們的建國大業，能不能迅速的展開，順利的完成，完全要看我們這一輩靑年，能不能做一個建國靑年。那末，「怎樣做一個建國靑年」呢？茲謹就管見所及，略陳數義於後，願與全國有志有爲有守的靑年朋友們共勉之。</p>
<p>提高健康水準</p>
<p>第一，我們要做一個建國靑年必　提高健康的水準。我國目前正在中學受敎育的靑年學生，據最近發表的數字，已達一百十六萬。但是，因爲我們一般同胞，貧苦得很，一般靑年，往往營養不良，身體未老先衰，贏弱多病，以致投考空軍的靑年，體格及格者只有百分之一，考投海軍的體格及格者也只有百分之一二。以這樣不健康的靑年，怎樣能够建設起富强康樂的新中國呢？英國有一句很流行的俗語說：「三等體格的國民，不能造成一等的國家，」我們靑年是國家的新國民，也是建國的生力軍。以這樣衰弱多病的靑年，恐怕三等體格的國民還够不上，又怎樣能够建設起一等强國呢？所以我們要造成一個眞正的，名實相符的一等國家，和美英蘇三大強國並駕齊驅，雄飛世界，一定要提高人民的健康水準，尤其要提高靑年的健康水準。怎樣才能提高我們的健康水準呢？自然，最重要的要注意運動。不但上體育課要好好的運動，並且要每天舉行早操，課間操及課外運動。我們不可一天不吃飯，也不可一天不運動。運動不一定要很大的蓮動塲和很多很好的運動設備，也不一定靑年學生才要有運動，如打乒乓球，打羽毛球，打太極拳以及踢毽子，從手操等，都是大衆化的輕而易舉的並且有益健康的運動。我們靑年學生，要養成人人歡喜運動，天天按時運動的生活習慣，那一定可以使我們的體格，轉弱爲强，使積弱多病的「東亞病夫」，一變而爲積健爲雄的勇猛如虎的一糾糾武夫」。其次，我們要講究衛生。如起得早，睡得早，作息有定時，飲食有定量，不吃生冷的東西，沒有不良的嗜好，以及改進營養並養成其他種種的衛生習慣等，都是强身去病，增進健康的方法。盼望全國靑年，人人注意運動。講究衛生，把我們的體格鍜鍊成爲金剛不壞之身，做一個孔武有力的，勇敢有爲的建國靑年。</p>
<p>充實道德修養</p>
<p>第二，我們要做一個建國靑年，須有高尙的道德和人格。美國已故的總統羅斯福先生說得好，「有知識而缺乏道德的修養，好像拿一柄新式機關槍交給一個手段高明的强盜。」英國大文豪蕭伯納先生也說：「我們人類活在世男上的行爲，一方面是享受，一方面是供獻。如果一個人活着對於社會上所貢獻的，比較所享受的來得多，那他就可以算是有人格。而且他所貢獻的質和量，能够超過他所享受的質和量，在比例上若差得愈大，那他的人格就愈使人家感爲偉大。反之，如果一個人所享受的質和量，超過於他所貢獻的，那在他便白多佔了人羣的便宜，便應算他沒有人格，或者人格破產。」我們的國父中山先生也以「人生以服務爲目的，不以奪取爲目的」來敎訓我們。所以要做一個建國靑年，必須養成貢獻能力，服務人羣，爲改造社會，建設國家，造福人類而奮鬥犧牲的高尙道德和人格。當這建國的大時代，看看我們的國家社會，多的是有知識而缺乏道德修養的强盜，他們所享受的質和量往往超過於他們所貢獻的，他們是以奪取爲目的而不以服務爲目的的。以至整個國家社會，弄得紛亂如麻，一般無知民衆，陷於水深火熟。我們立志救國救民的建國青年，必須一反他們的所作所爲，貢獻我們的知識能力，甚至於貢獻我們的生命財產，爲建設富强康樂的新社會和新中國而忠實服務，做一個「鞠躬盡瘁」，「精忠報國」的建國靑年。（未完）</p>

<h3>市長私邸昨開會議　定抑平糧價方案</h3>
<p>開發糧源並鼓勵米商自由採辦</p>
<p>連日糧價高漲，人心不免恐慌。昨日下午二時，吳市長在其私邸邀約警備司令宣鐵吾，社會局要吳開先，民政處長張曉崧，行政處長方志超，警察局代局長兪叔平等十餘人，檢討本市糧食問題。僉以市面並不缺米，全係各物上漲，人心恐慌所致。今後決擬（一）請求上峯增撥糧源，（二）鼓勵糧商自由採辦，（三）配售糧食，由社會局逐日公布其商店店名及地點，以便人民購買與政府監督等云。會議至四時始散。</p>
<p>三方會同辦理配米</p>
<p>又訊：市長定今最八時，在市府再度召集全市米商及米號代表談話，屆時各米號代表將向吳市長要求市府命令憑戶口證購配米一事，移由各區公所自行辦理，各米店當派店員協助。關於此問題據吳市長表示，配給戶口米米商不能推卸責任，現市府已行文通知谷米號及警察分局區公所等，由三方面會同辦理，並擬定有配米細則，規定各米店之配量及食米種類等等。市長並保證每日確自倉庫內提出一萬石米，手績方面亦力求簡化，並無故意延遲之處。各米號若有不以供市等情發現，市府已飭警局嚴密澈査。</p>
<p>我向瑞士訂購洋米</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉；糧食部目前正與瑞士接洽，訂購大量洋米中。據中信局人士表示：我國在海外訂購之洋米已不少，目前之問題在如何能按期運到，以減輕此靑黄不接時期之糧荒。記者又以外傳訂購洋米均屬次等貨一點，詢之有關方面，其答覆爲：所購洋米之中，不乏高級之米，但在暹米之中，終須有幾成爲秈米。又我國近與阿根廷談判購買小委十萬噸，聞談判進行甚爲順利，但合同尙未簽字。</p>
<h3>調整麵粉配價　本週內即可決定</h3>
<p>本市福新等各大麵粉廠，近以原料高漲，要求吳市長提高配給價格，據悉：吳氏已允俟田糧會議閉幕後，即予調整配價，是以本星期內即可解決。惟該業上次向吳市長所提成本，係照小麥十一萬元計算，目前麥價已漲達十四萬元，成本亦吿增加。且市上小麥日益枯竭。故該業將要求當局配給製粉原料，或以洋粉作價供應市面。</p>
<h3>解決食油供應　設立調節委會</h3>
<p>關於滬市食汕供應問題，據悉當局決定設立食油調節委員會，由市政府·中信局·中農行·榨油業公會·中植油廠·汕商業公會·及販賣商等七單位聯合參加組成。今日將由各單位提出名單，經核定後，預定週三正式成立。中信局爲配合此項措施，昨日已運六〇〇〇噸大豆抵滬云。</p>
<h3>出售戶口配米　社局核准米號表</h3>
<p>社會局爲解除市民未糧恐慌，逐日拋售白粳暹邏米等九千包，合市石一萬一千餘祖，分配各米號零售。並規定市民向米號購買配給米，須憑戶籍證·社局並通知各米號登記候核，現據社局核准各米號，計有六百五十餘家。茲將各米號及地址列表刋左，俾市民購買配米時參閱。</p>

<h3>蠶絲產銷會通過　烘蘭收蘭辦法　申貸絲廠辦理登記手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蠶絲產銷委員會，於昨日下午二時起，在中蠶公司召開第一次常務委員會，到譚熙浮，夏晋熊，王紫霜，顏澤之，陳雋人，馬季平，王伯天，周紀臞，葛敬中，湯錫祥等，討論至六時許，始吿散會。當通過合作烘繭辦法要點，及分區聯合收繭辦法要點全部條文。</p>
<p>又該會自昨日起，至八日止，辦理申貸絲廠登記手緻。凡蘇浙絲廠商，曾於勝利後，由國家銀行貸款，並經聯合管理收繭繅絲，於本年四月底以前，全部淸償，並具有相當保證者，如欲收購春繭，均可至本市虎丘路八十八號六樓該會，辦理登記手續云。</p>
<h3>中紡公司今起　辦理配紗登記</h3>
<p>中紡公司自於上週起，將棉紗配價提高爲每件四百六十萬元後，配紗日期亦改爲每星期三次，幷定今（五）日起，開始辦理廠商配紗登記。各廠商須向該公司調査科索取工作狀况表，詳實塡報，以憑核定。如有塡報不實，將視情節輕重，予以處分。至新添或新開工機數暫不配紗，俟該公司棉紗產量增加時，再行核配云。</p>
<h3>二二八事變中　台各糖廠損失輕微　台糖公司沈總經理發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司總經理沈鎭南，在京接洽台糖所用之肥料事畢，日前返滬。據談：自台灣二二八事變敉平後，渠曾於四月七日起，分赴全島各糖廠視察。各地公司同人，大致均屬安全。各單位公家財物損失，亦屬輕微。</p>
<p>渠稱：台糖係台省最重要之工業。二萬戶員工，賴以工作。十萬戶農民賴以生活。自台省光復以來，工廠之修復工作，已完成一大部份。除台灣銀行供給大宗復舊款項，以及流動資金外，最近並向中國銀行借款美金五百萬元，向國外購買五金材料，以使本年年底完成修復三十個工廠之計劃。甘蔗的稱植面積，已達九萬甲，超過預定目標，故明年產糖三十萬噸計劃，可以達到目的，並可爲國家掙回外匯頭寸，每出口一噸美金四百元。然蔗種需於本年七八月至明年三月間，陸續分批播種。故爲完成該項計劃，本年需用肥料八萬噸。此中除國內可供給二萬噸外，其餘六萬噸，須仰給於國外，每噸需美金一百元，故共需外匯美金六百萬元。然目前公布之第二季限額輸入品，肥料僅佔美金五十萬元，尙須分配全國，當感不敷。</p>
<p>惟渠指出：設台糖公司能獲得充份肥料，單以完成產糖四十萬噸之計劃言，則除以卅萬噸供國內消耗外，另以十萬噸推廣輸出，一年中即可爲國家掙回外匯美金四千萬元。所得實將十倍於購買肥料時之外匯支出。於平衡我國國際收支一點，實與有功云云。</p>

<h3>再談「砂眼」</h3>
<p>— 陸南山</p>
<p>本報讀者前詢黃丹及青魚胆合製，可否醫治砂眼？</p>
<p>按黄丹係鉛之養化物，以金屬鉛加熱至攝氏四百度，而成爲紅色粉劑，又名赤丹，或名鉛丹，紳農本草論其性味，爲辛微寒有毒，其效能及主治均爲外科所用，對於眼科限於外用，如審視瑤函中之玉龍丹。搜風散，均配合他藥敷搽眼皮。且黄丹質地　糙，雖加研磨極細，難免仍有渣滓，一經點入目內，勢必有壞傷黑睛，徒增目疾，故任何眼科醫師之限藥製造，均甚爲精細，磨煉煆製有經年累月，始克製成，次非一般病家，自已可粗製濫造，而治療砂眼也，愼之。靑魚胆因其性味苦寒，其功效固可主治目赤障翳，故眼科常有用之，對於初起之砂眼結合膜炎之輕微者，尙能見效，然此藥亦非單獨可用，更須煉製，如審視瑤函中之熊胆膏，即有靑魚胆與他藥配合而成者，故此藥實爲佐藥之一耳。</p>
<p>砂眼爲普遍流行之眼疾，凡公共塲所之面中手帕，及其他接觸物，或人烟稠密處，工作不潔時，有灰塵飛砂刺激其眼，最易傳染。此病初起時，往往無自覺症狀，尋常兩眼均患之，俟後，晨起有分泌物作癢流淚，自覺灼熱而痛，似有灰砂嵌入目內，視力亦漸覺昏糊，此病最緊要者，莫如易起黑睛垂簾障，又名血管翳，及內皮緊急，而致睫毛倒刺，或其他險症，可使半盲及全盲，砂眼之病輕者，自可以治愈，如患病久而重者，祗須治療合宜，亦無有不愈者，惟須防復發耳。古籍眼科書目中，稱此病爲椒瘡藥瘡，並有內服藥方，如審視瑤函中之歸芍紅花散除風淸脾飲，醫宗金鑑之淸脾凉血湯，對於此病初起及發炎，尙能奏效，蓋日期久長之砂眼，汲長綆短，無濟於事；故都均用手術，手術之如何，亦視病情之輕重爲定，故未患砂眼者，必須預防之，已患砂眼者，須就地請眼科專家詳細診治，方爲穩妥。</p>
<h3>淡豆鼓</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>（配宜西林是膏黴菌素）</p>
<p>中國在漢朝時，張仲景所用的梔豉湯，晋朝時葛稚川所用的的葱豉湯聖僧散，其中都有淡豆豉一藥，那淡豆豉就是靑徵菌寄生過的遺物，就是含有配宜西林，古人把他用之於治瘟熱，可見早知此中妙義。</p>
<p>在外科的領域上，有一種葱鼓餅，貼治癰疽大毒，將葱豉餅貼於患部，外用熨灸的方法，這也似配宜西林的外用法。</p>
<p>外國科學家知道配宜西林是要冷藏避熱，中國古醫，用之入煎劑，或熨灸，在效力未勉要打折扣，這是精粗之別罷。</p>
<p>配宜西林未到中國之前，余常用淡豆豉洽各種外症，每收殊異之效，現在配宜西林已風行國內，往住遇發背流注，他人用過此品注射未愈，乃用陽和湯治之，奏效甚速。——這眞是各有其長，何必捨已從人呢？</p>
<h3>脚氣衝心</h3>
<p>— 龔佩英</p>
<p>脚氣衝心之病，其原因乃血液有毒素，所謂衝心者乃毒素侵犯心藏，使心藏麻痺而死；故患脚氣病，宜從速醫治，否則，至於衝心，殊屬危險；且有不及施救者：昔年報載：「某甲病脚腫，在路喚車就幾、倉卒氣逆，仆地死。」此即毒素攻心，心藏陷於麻痺立即死亡之故也。脚氣衝心旣以血中毒素爲原因之症候，則治法當以排毒療法爲主，排毒之藥，首推犀·羚·麝·腦·牛黄·硃砂·等，適應方劑如：千金犀角施覆花湯·赤水玄珠脚氣薏仁散，玉樞丹，蘇合香丸，局方牛黄淸心丸，皆爲脚氣衝心症之血液消毒藥。</p>
<h3>小兒肺炎</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>肺炎之發生，有由於肺炎菌侵入而成者，謂之急性肺炎，或謂原發性肺炎；有由於痧子，傷寒，天痘，百日咳等傳染病延誤而成者，謂之局部肺炎，或謂續發性肺炎。而氣候之變化，抵抗力之减弱，尤爲使肺炎患者急速變化之重大原因。</p>
<p>本症初起寒熱，咳嗆作吐，有似感冒，繼即身熱轉甚，有高至四十一度者，脈象疾數，痰聲漉漉，咳嗆頻作，氣急鼻扇，涕淚俱無，待熱度下降，咳鬆氣平，病勢始見轉機。經過時期，約在一星期以上；若身熱留戀不退，氣急鼻扇，日增不已，則脈轉細數，面氣發爲靑紫，以致昏睡虛脫而亡。其由傷寒痧子等延誤而致者，則發熱作咳，日久不退，漸至呼吸不舒，氣急鼻扇，轉爲痙厥，卒至不救。</p>
<p>炎之一字，有熱之意義，故恒人見解，以爲肺炎即是肺熱，且脈數體溫，故用藥喜偏清凉，實則亦不一定，須詳審其證情，對症用藥。淸凉凉之劑，固不可廢，而附桂等辛溫之品，亦當相機參用。蓋肺炎之發熱，往往因寒痰內阻，肺氣不宣，肺藏之循環，受其障碍，則血中之炭酸等廢物，停積必多，心臟起救濟作用，故呼吸加增，脈數而體溫上升者，治當用麻黄桂枝等辛溫之品，以刺激肺臟血管，鼓舞心臟機能，使汗腺啓發，病毒始有排洩之機也。</p>
<p>肺炎初起，肌熱無汗，咳嗆不暢，氣急鼻煽，苔白脈數，即用生麻黃，白芥子，廣玉金，製半夏，橘紅，杏仁，紫苑，遠志，天將殼等宣開　氣，證情之重者，麻黄宜重用。如咳嗆痰鳴，神蒙驚惕，有動風痙厥之象，可加硃胆星，乾萬蒲，活磁石，生牡蠣及牛黄淸心丸。如肌熱不爲汗解，舌潤脈軟，神疲睛露，心陽已見衰弱，則用黄附片，川桂枝，淡乾姜，五味子，白芥子，製半夏，橘紅，急急以回陽强心爲主。如病已數發，脈微肢冷，咳嗆氣逆，水飲不納者，宜重用黄附片，黑錫丹，磁石，龍骨，牡蠣等。</p>
<p>肺炎而見舌絳苔黄，口渴引飲，咳嗆痰鳴，氣急鼻扇，宜偏於淸凉，以麻否石甘湯爲主，與痧子傷寒等之熱性傳染病併發者，當先解除其肺炎徵象，以免引起不測之變化。若此等傳染病日久不愈，因延誤而轉變肺炎者，熱毒未解，大小靑龍湯合解毒湯有相當之功效。肺炎氣急鼻扇，其胸必隆起，故古名肺脹，外用芥子末用蜂蜜調敷，如嫌其易於起泡，金黄如意散用金銀花露調敷亦眭。蓋其有解炎消腫之效，與內服藥同用，收效較速。</p>

<h3>旅大門外堡壘貔子窩</h3>
<p>— 東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>本報瀋陽廿四日航訊</p>
<p>貔子窩，幽靜的站在遼東半島東海岸上，過去，它是日人「關東州」圈兒內的一個魚鹽之鄕，今天，它又有了新生命，它是一個瞭望臺，它是一個海岸堡壘。</p>
<p>中蘇友好條約所劃的旅順海軍根據地警戒綫，較比過去「關東州」圈兒小一些，貔子窩剛剛劃在了圈兒外，因而它成了一個不摻雜任何政治成份靠着圈兒的第一個要城。</p>
<p>古貿易港</p>
<p>這裏，海岸綫很長，船舶港灣，數目實在不少，它是一個很古的貿易港，除了冬令結冰期，船舶往來不絕，南通大連·烟合·北達安東。朝鮮諸港。</p>
<p>近些的，那就是大孤山，莊河，長山列島了，船舶往來頻繁；城子曈，碧流河口，贊子河，凉水灣，魚船密集，風帆點點，海水悠悠，一派雄偉氣象。</p>
<p>從金州到貔子窩以北一城子瞳」的一條「金城」鐵路，就是把這裏和旅大打成一片的交通設施</p>
<p>貔子窩，是遼東半島沿海的軍事重要地區，雖然它有遼闊遠淺的沙灘，船隻不能靠岸的缺點，但它有長山列島中的廣鹿島，大長山島，小長山島，都可停靠船舶，還有一個海洋島，更像一個優良的港口，對於海岸的距離，近者數海浬，遠者也不過五十海浬，缺陷是可以彌補的。</p>
<p>長山列島</p>
<p>打開日本侵略遼東半島的歷史，我們可以看到，日本曾經在貔子窩附近的「花園口」和「鹽大澳」等地上陸，進佔了貔子窩，然後指向金州等地的史實，都可說明了它的市要性。</p>
<p>我們要用海陸空的運輸力量，接收大連，或者將來我海軍耀威海上，軍艦的加煤和補給，離開肯島太遠，那麼貔子窩海面的長山列島很合理想了。</p>
<p>但，蘇軍已經在長山列島中的幾個大島，像長山島和海洋島等駐兵了，根據人民的報吿，那裏還有共軍，上次普蘭店中蘇第一綫將領第二次的晤談，蘇將領答覆關於長山列島的問題說：「該處在海軍根據地界綫以內，蘇方設有警備司令部」。</p>
<p>旅順海軍根據地，在中蘇友好條約上，有明白的規定，那就是：「中蘇共同使用」，那麼長山列島，當然國軍可往來停泊和使用的。</p>
<p>旅順，大連，長山列島……，是中國的領土，在中蘇所訂共同使用的三十年裏，實在需要眞誠的「友好」和切實的「合作」。</p>
<p>漁民樂園</p>
<p>貔子窩的海面，由於長山大小十六個鳥所組成的遼闊區械，是漁人的樂回，在日人控制時代，設有「東洋捕鯨會社關東州事業廠」，獐子島附近出產的「鰲子魚」量著名，日人從十三年起，利用潛水機，經營漁業，得有大　的收穫。</p>
<p>當地漁民吿訴記者說：「長山，廣鹿，海洋，獐子，大小耗子（老鼠）島，從前有千多隻漁船，每日可捕大頭·滑十和雜魚等三四千斤，現在漁業公會登記的漁船僅有六十多隻，因爲在光復後，漁船被拉走的拉走，破壞的破壞，加以地方不靖，所以越來越少了。</p>
<p>富饒鹽田</p>
<p>十六個島上，約有六萬的人口，多半是直接和間接靠打漁爲生的，那裏除了好多海產魚蝦，就是「海參」和「干貝」等著名產品了，不過他們捕魚的技術，還沿前傳統的方法，像二十三塊「　綱」，三十五至四十塊的「掛網」，都是他們唯一的捕魚利器，如果要求大量生鹽，還須加以改善的。</p>
<p>貔子窩的魚臺，旣然很有名，鹽產更是名聲連播，貔子高所有鹽田和設備，在國內是數一數二的。</p>
<p>貔子窩，在日俄戰後，劃歸日本關東州屬轄後，”人就從事鹽產的開發，淸光緒三十二年劃設「滿漢公司」，開始建設鹽田，後改爲「日本集業株式會社」，漸次擴展，並强行收買民灘，所營鹽田計有「夾心子」「東老灘」「碧流河」三難塲。</p>
<p>民國二十八年「東洋拓殖株式會社貔子窩鹽業所」又在貔予窩，宋家屯，淸水河三處，開設　田，建設方吿竣事就宣吿降伏了</p>
<p>民國二十年一日本　業株式會社」在東老灘設立「加工鹽工塲」，民國二十七年，又在夾心子設立「加里工廠」。</p>
<p>八一·五光復後，共軍在此設立鹽務機構，僅將原存鹽斤大部出賣，’並未恢復公難。</p>
<p>貔子窩鹽田的面積和產量，據統計數目字吿訴我們是這樣的：</p>
<p>淸水河，宋家屯，貔子窩，夾心子，東老灘，碧流河等六處鹽田，計公灘有四千九百三十九陌，年產鹽四百擔；民有六百一十陌，年產七十三萬擔，總計公私鹽田面積五千五百四十九陌，年產四百七十三萬担，一陌是一萬平方米，一担是按一百斤計算的</p>
<p>「加工鹽」工廠出品，計有洗滌鹽一種，「加里工廠」出品，有煎熬鹽，鹽化加里，硫酸加里，硫酸苦土，硫化碱，高溫結晶，低溫結晶，滷塊，臭素。</p>
<p>鹽田主要的設備，所有灘內揚水，都用電動機，運輸有輕便鐵道，各灘塲有地下水　，把滷水直接送往工廠，充作原料，在東老灘設有變電所和水源地，專供鹽田和工廠全部　用，光復後，離房電氣鐵道和工廠裏的機器，以及各項設備，除被蘇聯和共軍運走一部外，所集群又遭受當地無知人民不斷的竊盜和搬遷。</p>
<p>「金州鹽塲公署」接收了這些鹽田，着手計劃復工，但因電源斷絕，電桿，電綫，電動機破壞，大部鹽田不能納入海水，在不得已中，正辦理增加木製水車，代替電力，勉强開晒，僅約佔全鹽田三分之一，業經出租，已開始下灘工作，四月末就可產鹽，其餘必須電源恢復後，纔能開晒，此外工作不能開展，那就是人爲的缺欠和能力不够了！</p>
<p>記者曾經到離開貔子窩廿多里的「夾心子鹽灘」去參觀，坐在輕便鐵道推畢上，看着鹽田偉大的塲面，接連不斷的方塊鹽田，乾涸沒生氣的躺着，一所所很堅固的工人石頭房子，沒有了上蓋，沒有了門窗，小火車頭，機件不全，沒法開動，電綫桿沒有電綫，一切不靈。</p>
<p>工廠內部情形凄凉，熬鹽的鍋爐，銹毁腐蝕了，洗滌廠的機器，沒有了皮帶，機器銹毁的更慘重，使人不敢多看下去。</p>
<p>東北光復快兩年了，廿多個月的時光，這些機器就在沒有了門窗的工廠裏，風雨吹打腐蝕着，共軍在這裏的時候，把存鹽賣了一大部份，並且拿走了全部的皮帶和其他的東西，沒做復工的工作。</p>
<p>國軍收復又是三個多月了，金州鹽塲公署，在本年二月間派人來接收，據負責人說：「沒有電，沒有煤，開工難上難，不過公署已擬定了全縣各鹽務整個復工計劃，復工費是東北流通券廿億元，近期可能依次復工」。</p>
<p>大家在傷心之餘，覺得如果馬上拚命作去，還是希望無窮，否則鹽田越發的荒廢，機器很快的要成爲爛鐵了。</p>
<h3>吼罷，貔貅</h3>
<p>「貔子窩」的稱呼由來，是在市街的西端，有個臨海的山頭，當地人把他呌做龍頭山，山有洞窩，古年多貔貅猛獸，居處其中，所以給它加上了這個稱號。</p>
<p>管內區劃原爲廿會，會　數屯，現在改爲四街一百個屯，裏面含有島與上的五會卅二屯，共有二萬四千二百五十六戶，十八萬五千六百五十人，原住日人一千七百人，已早被遣送了。</p>
<p>貔子窩背山面海，氣勢很雄壯，道街很整齊，房舍建築也很好，全區有將近三十個的中學和小學校，校舍都很寬敞宏壯，惜乎沒有經費，敎師拿不到錢，有些的確是「枵腹從公」，學生沒有課本念，急的淚漣漣。</p>
<p>這個遼東半島的海岸堡壘，需要堅强壯大起來，漁鹽的富饒，更需要充份發揮利用，收復不久的貔子窩敎育，再也不能不管了，否則是不堪狂風暴雨一擊的。</p>

<h3>中校學生籲停會考</h3>
<p>親愛的同學們；</p>
<p>本屆高中畢業會考必須舉行的法令公布後，我們這一羣高三的學生就起了極大的恐慌與不安，會考關係我們本屆畢業同學的命運，我們不得不起來請願敎育當局暫緩舉行。</p>
<p>八年的戰爭敎育受了莫大的打擊和摧殘，在比環境中，我們當然不能學到完整的敎育，並且戰時在特殊之惡勢力下各校採用之課本不能統一。不能受到有系統的敎育，程度的不齊這是必然的，如何能强加統一考試呢？而會考公布日期太侷促了，要在這短短之時期內，把三年的課程從頭溫起，即使夜以繼日毫不休息強記溫習，而僥倖能應付過去，但這種投機性質是很危險的，而對學生本身的健康是有很大的損害，這不是離開曾老之眞諦太遠了嗎？</p>
<p>敎育局提到會考是在於提高學生程度，但是學生爲了應付考試而讀書，爲爭分數爭一紙畢業證書，而夜以繼日鞠躬盡瘁，而實際還不能得到整個的理解，這如何能提高學生的程度呢？所以我們希望敎育局從速根本做起，提高學生程度不單是從一次曾考所能够的，現在我們敎育經費僅佔百分之三·七，會考所費甚鉅實感浪費而且會考之後仍要經過一次大學入學考試，會考實無必要，與其一筆龐大款子放在無意義的會考上，不如提高敎育經費，安定敎師生活以期敎育水準眞正提高。</p>
<p>親愛的同學們，現在我們再不能沉默地等待了，爲了我們本身的利益，我們應該快些聯絡起來響應南京同學的要求，以堅決誠懇的心向敎育當局請願，希望敎育當局接受我們這一點要停止會考。（務光女中）</p>

<h3>上海文藝作家協會成立宣言</h3>
<p>無可否認，上海是全國文化的中心，也是遠東文化交流的總匯，上海作家的動態不但影響全國作家，上海作家的團體也爲中外觀瞻所繫，世界作家所注意。戰前如此，戰後還是如此。然而我們放眼一看，作家組織團體，參加團體的風氣，戰前並不算盛行，戰後更感覺寂寞，這固然由於我們的民族性不長於組織，也是由於作家羣興趣淡，聯繫少，落落寡合的原因。可是擺在眼前的現實，更不容抹煞，是個破碎支離各自爲政的局面；作爲一個精神技師的文藝作家，似乎首先應該負起精神教育的責任，在此環境中，共同建立一種新的寫作信念，新的寫作風氣，以推進時代，創造時代。我們更相信，女藝界要先政治的民主而民主，要先國家的統一而統一，因此我們認爲宗派主義，門戶之見是妨害這個目標的；我們認爲凡以文藝事業爲職志的同道都應該聯合起來？團結起來；我們更認爲文藝團體之間，不但不應有牴觸摩擦；而是應該相輔而成，互助互立。尤其在上海，作家這樣多，園地這樣荒蕪，更希望繼續不斷的產生姊妹團體，携手前進。</p>
<p>進一步的說法，我們認爲作品的同一主題，基於作家的思想性格的不同，一定會有不同的反映，不同的着筆；這正是文藝的特性，也是文藝的道路。這種多角的特性和寬廣的道路，我們不但要承認他，而且要愛護他，因此我們只問你是不是忠於藝術？忠於你的感覺體騐？忠於寫作自由？誰也不必問誰的宗敎信仰，政治關係，同樣都是好朋友，都希望參加這個團體。我們要問一句：爲什麽一個國家有限的幾位作家，還不能融合？所以上海的文藝團體不但不必造一扇大門，最好連國籍的界限也不讓他存在。我們這個團體，不但要和寫作幾十年的成名作家握手，也要和勇於工作，前途無量的靑年作家握手但是爲了要紀念五四的新文化運動，要配合創造新文藝，實騐新理想的五四精神，我們倉卒的成立了。不過這是工作的開始，團結的開始，希望住在上海的作家，都來參加，散區各地的作家，多多指導，共同發揚我們對於文藝作家關係上的新理想。</p>
<h3>文藝與人生——祝上海文藝作家協會成立</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>本人是一個從事繪畫工作者，對文藝興趣；雖然很濃，但是執筆爲文，每感頭痛，同文常以昧於「以文會友，以友輔仁」之義指摘，現値上海文藝作家協會成立之日，不能無一言，以爲壽，所以我就拿「文藝與人生」來談之。</p>
<p>人生是什麽？這問題各人主觀的見解不同，莎士比亞認爲人生便是戲劇，悲歡離合組成戲劇性的人生，李白拿人生看成做夢，而發抒他個人對宇宙的幻想，創造偉大的詩歌，托爾斯泰，他說：「人生是幸勤的工作，而不是一種享受。」「爲人生而藝術。」人生有時像一束美麗的花朶，活色生香，芬芳襲人，有時又像波濤洶湧，萬丈在瀾，闊大雄奇，不可方物。或重如泰山，或輕如鴻毛，人生究竟是什麽？很難下一個確切的解答。</p>
<p>文藝兩個字，分開來講，就是文學和藝術，合起來講，涵有文學的藝術術，或藝術性的文字，藝術的含義很廣，照普通說法，，「使天然界事物適應人類生活之用的一種技巧」，但是人類活動，有兩種不同的目標，一種是需要，一種是欣賞，陶土製器，匠人築屋，只是應付需要而活動，畫家作品，音樂演奏，是應付欣賞而活動，於是藝術也就分成兩種，爲需要而製作的，便是實用藝術，爲欣賞而創造的，就是純藝術或美術。</p>
<p>一切藝術都是象徵的，所以黑智爾（Hcgel）的主張，藝術所憑藉的物質基礎愈多，品格愈低，愈少則品格愈高，故建築爲最低品的藝術，詩歌爲最高品的藝術，因爲他所憑藉的媒介物，僅一種文字的符號，而能給予讀者整個的觀念。</p>
<p>文學由他廣義的說法，可以包括人類生活，和人生活動的全體範圍，以及自然一切已知的現象，他是給予我們間接經騐的最大源泉，使已往世界存留不滅，我們因文學的媒介，得與古昔哲人如孔子，屈原，柏拉圖，亞理士多德，晤對一室，足不出戶，而能神遊於世界名都的埃及，巴比倫，雅典，羅馬，使主觀中的理想世界擴大。</p>
<p>十五世紀意大利的文藝復興運動，是奠定近世人類文明的柱石，新文化運動的先　，我們上每文藝作家協會，定五四成立，自于其深長的意義和偉大的使命</p>
<h3>花朶</h3>
<p>— 羅明</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>有誰深切的摯意的收穫了少女們的最初的戀情，有誰耕耘着那孕育着春天的冀望的心田。你知道誰是最幸福的人啊，飲着戀愛的蜜汁，在望着一個燦爛的明天哪？</p>
<p>你能想象一個感情貧乏的人嗎？凄冷地在寂寞的人寰中來去。你能想象一個失幸的人嗎？他那被棄逐在幸福的門外時的一份悲哀。</p>
<p>泳於感情生活的園池裏，寫下嘗試的詩篇，自詡着白雲一樣悠馳的年華。你年靑的人呀，曾爲接受最初的祝福而喜悅嗎。</p>
<p>美麗的花朵不會結成堅實的菓子，眞如最好的結局常是一個最壞的開始。如果尋覓着年少者的情愛，而能不長花刺折了含苞的希望回來，這是一首最佳的抒情詩。自然，奢望的幻滅是令人痛苦的，你曾否傷感於你沒底的鞋子，即使是一雙沒底的鞋子，也該步向前去，這也許是一個可愛的故事，有一天，會忙勞了一雙纖手，你得到一變縫入心意的鞋子，到麼溫暖和細緻。</p>
<p>花葉正將繽紛，夢境亦常深沉，以一頁詩情，誰不下這靑春的序唱呢。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>是少女的眸子給于了你最深沉的情意，還是永遠也忘不了這幽邃的瞳神？</p>
<p>在我，有着淸楚的回憶：當我展示了我的靑春的散頁的時候，我曾經被一對眸子所啓示。生命成熟的時節：你有權利從那童稚的草野進入　月的花園。從那時開始，我珍貴起自己的生命，我驕傲我有着初放的靑春。</p>
<p>我沒有忘去接受那量初的眸子底祝福時的喜悅，我也沒其遺落被首次慰撫的歡愉。那悠長的歲月呀，我浸沉在細緻的遙念裏，像一位優秀的雕刻家一樣，我修飾着自己的心境。我想望得那樣深遠，那機的親摯以後，我也有了那麽一份勇氣，羞澀地寄去我的洋溢着的情景。</p>
<p>如果青春是以愛情來灌溉的，那末我的生命決不會柘萎而死</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>每一個少男都其他自己的夢境，其人爲緋色的夢而醉心，有人爲金色的夢而色喜，有人爲紫色的夢而狂熱，也有人曾爲暗滄的夢境而哭泣。</p>
<p>夢，像愛琴海上的輕雲，飄忽而又輕盈，現在誰都在追覓那飄忽而又輕盈的夢。</p>
<p>有人說說：夢境由天才創造，那末榮譽將屬於有創造天才的年靑人吧，如果大儒樣的堅信人生永遠爲自私與嘲弄所交融，那末貪戀這一杯愛情的甜酒，將也永沒有最佳的醇味。而因此不禁爲那粗俗的境遇而悲哀，而企望尋覓一個絳色的天園創造我的未來了。——雖然這還是年靑人的羅曼蒂克的夢。</p>
<p>應該感謝一個純潔而眞摯的姑娘，是她牽引我到一個夢中。是她吿訴我友誼的原野能建築一個愛的庭樹，在那裏，有我們共同的天園。於是濛濛的月夜，樹蔭的河畔和懸着帘布的小窗旁，我們伴着愛而散步。</p>
<p>也許是這樣啓始的吧，我感到生命的價値，我也探知了人類最眞摯與崇高的天性。</p>
<p>於是，我，你，也有他，以一份才智和熟情獻給一個人，以整個的人生理想與希望給予了他，我爲一個少女情懷的初放而歌唱着了。</p>
<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 周嘩珍</p>
<p>當悠閙和平　在我的週遭，</p>
<p>我憶起了往音——</p>
<p>和請與愉快在我心頭跳躍。</p>
<p>你伴隨着我，</p>
<p>我們——</p>
<p>在道旁徜徉。</p>
<p>聽靈魂的低聲互訴。</p>
<p>交換着會心的眼光。</p>
<p>懷念啊，</p>
<p>不斷的——</p>
<p>懷念啊！</p>
<p>你像我懷念的故鄕；</p>
<p>兒時嬉戲的地方，</p>
<p>我們也會一同遊賞。</p>
<p>而今——</p>
<p>遺憾跟着歲月衰老，</p>
<p>悵惘隨着時日滋長。</p>
<p>我不曉得——</p>
<p>用什麼來忘懷？</p>
<p>用什麽來振拔？</p>
<p>或將帶着——</p>
<p>永恒的憂鬱與懷念，</p>
<p>慢慢渡過——</p>
<p>茫茫的生命的海洋。</p>
<p>當悠閑和平靜在我的週遭</p>
<p>我憶起了往昔——</p>
<p>生命的哀悉在我心　飄搖。</p>

<h3>威爾斯預言</h3>
<p>— 楊寶</p>
<p>年前逝世的威爾期(H．G．Wclls）是個名作家和預言家，有次被人問道:『先生，在這瘋在的世界裏，十年後你能預言你會在什麽地方？</p>
<p>『十年後，』他答這：「我必遭到下面兩種命運之一，不是死去，便會被人關在「非瘋人院「裏面。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見失望了。他掃射了衆人一眼，見各人顏色平常，並沒有指摘或埋怨的意味，心下略安，便撇開了勤務，對守一，李明，及那位韓國同志問，「各位看？……」</p>
<p>大家都沒有說話，只有守一含混看說了「行了！」兩個字。</p>
<p>「我請求你一件事，」鶴見對那勤務說，「今天發生的事，可以認爲極度嚴重，也可說沒有事；所以請你暫時保守秘密，無論對誰，不必提起一個字：關於今天的各種－請你嚴格執行！」</p>
<p>勤務聽了這話，竟不敢答言，只十分嚴肅地立正，敬禮；作爲答覆。</p>
<p>這一幕盤問的勾當，至此結束。關於效果方面，據在座各人意見，一致認爲方式失敗，目標却也達到了。因最終目標，乃在査明這個勤務與那拋紙球少年，是否有所勾結。如今查明那勤務倒是十分坦白；答語上毫無敗詐或　瞞事實的技巧表現，所以大家，尤其是提議査問的李明，認爲滿意。這一條綫素，就此撇開了。</p>
<p>七點多鐘，守一等人都各自散開了。從七點多到九點半爲止，是大家約定交換情報的時期；九點半到十點正，四方面約定會齊，着手行動。交換情報，以這國際大旅社爲中心，總見就是這中心的當然主持人。</p>
<p>「沒有新發見。」這是竊見收到的第一個電話，這電話是正岩回部以後打來的。所謂沒有新發見，專指正岩回部之前，取道虹口，到萬歲館探視一過，看看那邊有沒有新事態。同時，當然也有這麽一點意思。希望萍像出現神蹟一般，忽然平安回館。正岩報吿之後，並吿訴鶴見，那個　値下女，已經下値，並且請假離館，當晚不再回値了。</p>
<p>約莫半小時後，鶴見收到本明電話，通知鶴見，他已遣派三小隊綫哨，到三個「窩子」探査去了。緊接就是韓方電話：</p>
<p>「承委託的八兩化學原料，本來分析成三種不同性質，都含有最猛烈毒素；現在騐明三種毒素，分量佔兩倍的一種，毒性最高；這，從裝置原料的黑色瓶子上，可以規定一部分。只有一點，不十分能確定，那就是那隻瓶上的號碼，與原來的不同。不過這種號碼，可以隨意寫上，並不能當作根……」</p>
<p>這電話仍舊是韓方那位老年領袖打來的：「八兩」仍是通話隱語，並且標明電話時刻，「原料」當然指萍子的問題而言；「毒素」指的日人背景；「三種性貿一，是三個「窩子」。</p>
<p>這個電話，說明他們的綫哨，根據那位靑年同志的報吿，現在査明，虹鎭一處，最爲可疑。「兩倍」，指出虹鎭方面的「票」是兩個人。「瓶」指的汽車。他們雖然査出虹　方面最爲可疑，但送「票」的汽車顏色形式都對，號碼却不是原來的那個「10915」。同時，老領袖又加解釋說，這種號碼，隨意可以僞造更動，似乎不能作爲懷疑根據。</p>
<h3>五四運動與話劇</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>五四，這一個可紀念的新文化遝動的日子，非特在政治上，文化上，有其革命進步的意義，在中國話劇運動史上，也是一個値得慶祝的日子。</p>
<p>五四運動所產生的新文化運動，具有「反封建文化」意義，非特實行了文字革命，而且正面地提出了重視美術，戲劇，小說價値的口號！而利用話劇的譯介與創作，作爲反封建思想的主流！</p>
<p>胡適之在「新靑年」上發表了一個獨幕劇「終身大事」，討論婚姻自由問題，同時潘家洵翻譯了易卜生的「挪拉」——「傀儡家庭」——亦成爲了討論婦女問題的名著；當時風起雲湧地演出，形成了中國話劇運動的勃興！最初是男扮女裝，後來提倡男女合演，並且認爲學生演劇有其宣傳敎育與研究藝術的價値！這種從「王八戲子吹鼓手」的傳統思想中把戲劇的新觀念正確地嚴肅地建立起來，也是中國戲劇史上的一件珍貴的紀錄！</p>
<p>非特此也，一切話劇的理論，演出方法，技術，統統從西洋介紹過來，由於「人藝劇專一的作，直至於令，「人藝」訓練出的人才，終於擴大了中國的話劇運動！</p>
<p>由於五四新文化運動的賜于，爲中國話劇運動　造了始基；直至民國十五年國民革命軍北伐，話劇得到更大的解放，再經民國廿六年抗日軍興，話劇才被肯定地認爲中國正統的藝術，話劇運動於以登峯造極！的確的，中國話劇運動，最初與辛亥革命有關，此後又　次與革命俱有連鎖關係，確是一種年靑而進步的藝術！更是新文化運動中的主流！所以話劇運動事實上是具有文化與革命雙重意義的一種活動！而話劇運動必有賴於演出，因爲話劇運動的特貿是：「沒有演出便沒有運動」：又惟其有「運動」必有「方向」，所以話劇演出絕不能失其工作的使命，否則盲目地工作與草率的演出必無補於事功，且近於無的而放矢！</p>
<p>話劇運動旣受五四新文化運動的賜予而成長，如今，欣逢復員後的「五四」，各方面對這日子特別珍貴隆重地在舉行紀念，獨我話劇界處於低潮崩潰情勢下，反而消聲匿跡一無所爲，似乎顯得格外的冷寂與痛苦！然而三十多年來的話劇運動，好容易在艱灘困苦中成長起來，絕不容在我輩一代中任其沒落與　示！吾人必須嚴續「五四」革新奮進的精神再接再勵，苦支下去，以度過目前的難關，期待情境的好轉，爭取蓬勃氣象的再現！</p>
<p>是時候了，話劇界的朋友們應該堅强地團結起來，多方面地爭取劇塲，爭取工作，不　艱苦，不怕窮困，爲新中國的文化建設前途而努力，爲珍貴「五四」運動對話劇運動的賜予而獻身！</p>

<p>病且譯醫好像成爲人上病情。然而這傾向顯示於全人類的意義上講，是太不幸也是太可怕的。</p>
<p>麻子看見了數學家就　厭，因爲數學家一定要把零寫成「〇」。而這形象的存在，好像是在故意給麻子爲難。其實作爲數學家們絕沒有意識到　些。</p>
<p>我說的自然是某些麻子。</p>
<p>像近人劉成禺先生開口閉口自稱劉麻子，見人輒大談敬亭柳麻子；快人快語，麻不足詬病，到反而成爲他的美處了。</p>
<p>如果你和一個服裝公司的店員交朋友，他特別注意是你的衣服。如果你和一個美術家交朋友，他會特別注意你的輪廓，如果你和理髮匠做朋友的話，他就得注意你的頭髮了。</p>
<p>我想如果你沒有太堅固的頸數子的話，我勸你還是少和劃子手交朋友的好。</p>
<p>我痛恨「藏垢納汚」的人性。</p>
<p>爲了行路時間的輕快，我想邀是少儲蓄些　便　　「高貴」而且「莊戲」的巨腹　內。</p>
<p>然而，　　和在上塲裏　的意義，却又是不大相同了。</p>
<p>中國有兩句成語式的神話。說是「陳　一脈千年，彭祖籌高八百。」</p>
<p>根據這神話，就有了下面的故事：</p>
<p>「彭祖降生時，陳搏便倚枕而睡，等陳搏醒過來問起侍者時。侍者査了査他，高祖父留下的流水賬說：「彭祖死了二百年了。」陳搏揉了揉了眼睛，從容地打了一個呵欠，又自作傷感地喟然長嘆道：「我知道這孩子帶不大的。」</p>
<p>一這自然是一個笑話，（笑不笑？讀者儘可自便。）</p>
<p>可是，我想到自己，還有許多向上，而且善良的朋友，未嘗敢妄思與彭祖齊　然而攬鏡自審，也並無一定會夭折的「死相」，我希望掌握我們命運的　長們，不要像陳搏似的一睡千年。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>美國人的糖果費</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>據說，一九四六年最初的十憫月中，美國人所化的糖果費達五萬二千萬美元之鉅，這消息傳到聯合國的一個小國代表的耳朶裏時，使他大發牢騷，說：</p>
<p>「假如我們的國家能以這筆糖果費充作國家全年經濟，則十年內即可使我們的國家成爲樂園。」</p>
<p>這個一舊聞」，一方面固　露了大國的富，一方面亦嘲笑了那小國的「小」。</p>
<p>然而在我們看來，倒是一點也沒有嘲笑意味的。美國人的十個月糖果費是五萬二千萬美元，而我們所期望於美國的對華貸款，亦不過五萬萬美元。最近政府發行的美金公債，猶不及此數。</p>
<p>有些事情不能深思，，一深思，往往會使人覺得很難堪。我們誠然不能向山姆叔叔呌說：「你們嘴上少甜一點，我們心裏就少苦一點。」可是將兩者間富強康樂，窮困潦倒的情形作一個對比，作爲炎黄子孫的我們又還有什麽可說呢？我們中有誰面對美國人的糖果消耗的數字竟能不膛目咋舌？</p>
<p>看來，某小國代表的牢騷，也不使僅是他個人的了，故羅斯福總統說得好：</p>
<p>「當有人吃得太多，另一些人吃得太少時，這裏就存在了社會問題，乃至國際問題。」</p>
<p>在戰時，美國成爲聯合國的兵工廠，在戰後，美國又負起了善後救濟的任務，這一切，無非說明了美國人亦有先見之明。他們知道超然物外是不可能的，使美國遷離地球是不可能的，讓每一個美國人拔着頭髮超昇，也是不于　的，旣然活在球上，對於這個混亂騷擾的世界就不得不負起一點兒責任。我們還記得去年杜魯門總統曾籲請美國人節約糧食、以挽救全世界的糧荒。杜魯門的那篇演說，大意也就是羅斯福所說過了的。</p>
<p>大戰結束已快兩年了，可是世界仍然阮隍不安，真正能恢復戰前安定康樂的生活水準的國家實在不多，且看這回美國當局發表糖的消耗數　，就　　了多少小國和弱國的代表，引起了多少人的牢騷！即使是大英帝國吧，那裏的人民對於美國人的糖果費也有點鹽羨有點嫉妬。由於迄今猶在施行的配給制度，使大多數英國人不得不羨慕起嫁給美國大兵的英國娘兒們來了。、</p>
<p>美國的一筆糖果費，除了牠的實用價値外，想不到居然還有這麽個副作用：它反映出現實世界是多麼寒傖呵！</p>
<h3>論詩鐘</h3>
<p>— 朝陽</p>
<p>閩人好作詩鐘，名之曰敲鐘，猶之催詩之速成，美其名曰擊鉢也。其格式甚繁多，亦如燈謎之具有各種格式，以嵌字集句分詠，爲最習見，嵌字之花樣，如起首兩字，曰並頭，末兩字爲並蒂，第三字則蜂腰，第五字則鶴滕，吾以爲分詠格最大方，能集句則尤佳，易哭庵先生爲此中高手，如蓬萊　備分詠，亦以集句出之。乃「其中綽釣多仙子，天下英雄惟使君」也。</p>
<p>吾友許季傳之尊人，有韓信與子字分詠一聯云：「胯下如何甘受辱，目中從此竟無餘。」此與上聯格式相似，雖非集句而子字空洞寬泛，貼切甚難，用目無餘子典，而以數虛字運動之，乃如五雀六燕，銖兩悉稱，佳製也。故當時同座，咸爲之擱筆。此與陳弢老日中一聯，嵌字並頭云；「日暮那堪途更遠，中乾其奈外猶强」，同一着用虛字，技巧亦相同，上句自况，途遠指長春，下句諷時事，或潛之，而陳乃飄然遠明，小人禍君子，往往適以福之也。</p>
<p>新知識</p>
<h3>靜電的新用途</h3>
<p>靜電如梳髮時使髮端豎立的電，現今在食品工業方面，正利用於質點之乾分離。</p>
<p>用此法能把有殻的堅果肉自其殼分離。把葡萄乾自葉埑等物剝落，把水片菜種子自穀粒除去，而害物種子自各種有用種子分離。</p>
<p>一種新的進步，是在把分離的礦物表面上，加以一番前提處理，俾其質點在靜電塲內易被拉開。酸氣，如氫氟峻氣，以之處理矽酸鹽礦物，已知爲有效。長石和石英能由此法分離。氫氟酸在長石質點上形成鉀與鋁之氟化物，但石英質點由此處理僅被鏤刻，而四氟化的汽即逸去。</p>
<p>至於分離加石灰石，白雲石，菱鎂石和硼砂等礦物，可用醋酸和安息酸二酸之汽作爲前提處理之物。</p>
<h3>平流層內防止焦的飛機窗</h3>
<p>— 白吿</p>
<p>雖然平流層飛行在商業上尙未實行，美國的光學工業界已經預備　會吸收不可見紫外射綫的玻璃，來製飛機窗，囚州爲在十五英里以上的高度，紫外射綫能在兩三分鐘的　焦人類的皮膚，或竟傷人性命。在地面上，我們所以未受到這些光綫的　焦酷刑，是因爲它們所含有的極短波長已爲大氣內的臭　（Ozone）濾掉之故。有一種玻璃會不讓　外綫通過，而只容許通過紅外綫的熱，且使比熱一經入內後，不令外逸，另有一種玻璃對於紫外綫和紅外綫均能吸收，因此把熱綫一併拒絕，在一只平流層飛機上，裝了具有這兩種玻璃的滑動窗，駕駛者就可運用它們來防禦不可見射綫，並控制飛機內的溫度。</p>
<h3>米高梅新片「海外流芳」三主角</h3>
<p>影譚</p>
<h3>「鐵血鴛鴦」</h3>
<p>— 箴</p>
<p>蘇德戰爭中，蘇聯婦女在前綫，嘗千辛，冒萬險，爲了保衛祖國的自由土地，爲了不讓那些納粹暴徒瘋狂的屠殺人類，妙們英勇地踏上了戰塲，她們無考慮的貢獻出了整個的生命。「鐵血鴛鴦」裏的女主角娜塔莎就是蘇聯十百萬婦中的一個。</p>
<p>影片一開始，當德國傘兵降落在列寗格勒附近時，集體農裏的蘇聯婦女無猶豫的拿起了武器向殘暴的敵人迎擊，繼之德寇侵蘇戰起，保衛祖國的號角晌了，無數的婦女參加了救護隊，開赴前綫，她們和紅軍戰士同上前綫，出生入死，與納粹暴徒們搏斗，扭轉了歷史的命運，完成了時代兒女的責任。</p>
<p>但是這些女孩子同樣有着聲富的感情，在車站上與愛人未婚夫離別時　淚盈眶依依不捨，可是一想到更重大的任務放在面前時，她們會毫不留戀的踏上征程，這裏把兒女情長的事情，被批判地降低在第二位，只有對祖國的愛，才彼大家所珍視。這樣的人格與精神，決不是希特勒以及任何力量所能摧毁的，蘇聯的能够戰勝德寇是有她必然條件的。</p>
<p>看慣了好萊塢片子的作風，蘇聯片子却帶了另一種風格。「鐵血鴛鴦」一開頭，就緊緊的抓住了你，導演對於德軍降落的塲面，以及後來娜塔莎殺死德軍哨兵，都是處理得異常乾凈利落，結尾時，蘇軍冒　向敵人衝鋒，婦女救護隊同上前綫等塲面，充分的顯示導演者的雄偉魄力。但細膩的地方，像娜塔莎與另一女看護發生爭執後，趕至中尉處解驟誤會，而軍醫在囑咐中尉不能受刺激，娜塔莎聽到後，呆呆的站在一邊考慮着怎樣處理目前的問題，那是全劇中導演處理得最佳的一塲了。</p>
<p>飾女主角娜塔莎的斐德羅華，她是蘇聯的功勛演員，在這個片子中有着高度的成就，每一塲戲的情緒轉變過程，都交待得極爲淸楚細膩。就是在整個片子中，每一個演員的拔，都是樸素堅實，也許這正是蘇聯演員的特質。</p>
<h3>「八死一生」</h3>
<p>— 鳴濤</p>
<p>「九死一生」是一句古老的成語，它常常被用來形容一個人從死亡裏逃生的不容易。固然，這「九」與「一」的比例，並非如算學上的數目字般確實，可是揆諸實際人生，却也不是什麽過份的誇張。</p>
<p>在九個死亡的機會並列，僅只留下一綫生機；換句話說，就是死亡的可能性，已經遠超過或然而近於必然，而活命的可能除非是遇逢到奇蹟似的偶然的時候，有那麽一種人，（我們姑且就目之其爲英雄吧。）他能够有把握的通過死亡的重圍，從極端險阻的陣勢裏殺將出來，在「孤注一擲」的押寳中賭贏了，於是旁邊的羣觀衆和聽衆，就把那位「英雄」這段可歌可泣的事蹟，總括地用「九死一生」這四個字來形容，來讚歎。</p>
<p>故事－河南商城縣長顧瑩，犯罪共達八十二件，其中</p>
<p>刑之罪計八起之多，却始終沒有槍斃。我看這決不是一條「査與事實不符，即請予以更正」的消息，消息的眞實性旣然無可懷疑，使我咒駡的倒是這個容許他「八死一生一的活着的原因。</p>
<p>有人說過，懦夫死百次，英雄死一次，因爲後者是强者，他對於死的機會知道選擇。現在可是蒼蠅死一次，老虎死百次的時候了。不要說七八次白紙紅字的「死一幹不了他，就是百次千次不也枉然，原因仍在於後他有神通廣大的逃生能力。</p>
<p>事實應該修正成語，因此我建議將「九死一生」改爲「八死一生」，如此似乎更富於現實意義。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>老祝看着他把那位闊太太送出門去，希望他就會立刻回來，可是等了四五分鐘，不見影踪；他知通今天再客氣不得，忙用極快的步法，趕出去追尋，果然在二門內的院子裏，發現熊處長正匆匆地在走出去。</p>
<p>「熊先生！對不起，我已經來拜望過你七次了！」他追上了他，便用極嚴肅的語氣大聲地說：「我所說的明天要　柳州去的批軍車是馬主任秘書親口告訴我的！熊先生，你要是可以允許我們搭乘的話，我們當然非常感激，如果眞有困難，不能答應我們　那也請你立刻爽爽快快的　絕！這是公事，我決不敢勉强！尤其我姓祝的跟你向來沒有交情，不能像方才那位潘太太那樣的强逼你做於法不合的事！然而我決不能苒等了！請你乾脆說一句，我立刻就走！我會把這三天來在你這兒見到和聽到的一切全寫出來，讓社會公論！是不是我們　三四十個到今天遠留在桂林演戲勞軍的窮戲予的性命，竟比不上幾位銀行職員的太太和電影女明星囤的商貨……</p>
<p>這一套又像牢騷，又像責駡一樣的　詞，倒使熊處長眞有些措手不及。</p>
<p>「我沒有雨不可以啊！」他很惶急地滿口否認。</p>
<p>「然而你也沒有說可以！」老祝又副上一步。</p>
<p>現在，年少的熊處長才想到文藝界在中國的政治上固然從來不起什麼麽作用，可是一般的民衆，却最同情他們，因此他們也自有一種爲他所應該注意的力量。</p>
<p>「好！好！你們的事我一定帮忙。明天那一批車子準把你們全體的人一起帶走！」他顯得很爽快地說。</p>
<p>一砲開書，老祝倒也有些喜出望外。</p>
<p>「那未，兄弟代表本團向熊處長謝謝！」他臉上不覺又透出了笑來。</p>
<p>「沒有關係！沒有關係！」</p>
<p>「可是，我們　申什麽上車呢？」</p>
<p>「下午你找我們一科的余科長去，他　會給你　好。」這時候的熊處長，態度倒真是很誠懇，並無推託或拖延的形跡</p>
<p>老祝　爲這肅總不會再有問題了，也就跟他歡然　別。（六三）</p>

The sound shook the heavens and lasted for a long time. The Chairman repeatedly nodded in the car, appearing very pleased, and even got out of the car once, raising his hand in acknowledgement to the excited crowds.

<h3>Chu Xichun Arrives in Nanjing from Taiyuan; Visits the Chairman and Presents Yan Xishan's Letter; Fierce Fighting Continues on the Outskirts of Taiyuan</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] General Chu Xichun spoke about the situation in Shanxi Province, saying: "This time, the Communist army has gathered tens of thousands of troops, vainly attempting to invade Taiyuan. The National troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them in the Shouyang and Pingding areas. The people of Taiyuan are calm and peaceful as usual. I firmly believe that the Shanxi National troops, under the command of Director Yan Xishan, will be able to defend the famous city and inflict a serious blow on the invading Communist army. The situation in northern Shanxi is also very stable. Since the National troops overcame Zuoyun and Youyu, although the Communist army has attempted to continue their attacks, they have ultimately been repelled by the National troops with the full assistance of the people. Datong is undergoing reconstruction amidst the ruins. The 2,000-kilowatt generator imported from abroad has arrived in Shanghai and will be transported to Shanxi soon. When the Communist army raided northern Shanxi last time, they destroyed the industrial equipment everywhere, especially the Pingwang Power Plant, which suffered the greatest losses. It is now actively planning to repair it. After the 2,000-kilowatt generator arrives, small-scale industries are expected to start operating. The people of Datong, who survived the disaster, originally had a very difficult life, but after the Sixth Work Team of the Executive Yuan Branch began its work, they have generally received relief and are now barely able to make ends meet."</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Office, 4th Dispatch] Fierce fighting continues on the outskirts of Taiyuan. The siege of Shouyang has not yet been lifted.

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] Fierce fighting is taking place between Linfen in the north and Pingyao. On the 3rd, three brigades of the Communist army in the suburbs of Hongdong fiercely attacked Hongdong, and the fighting was very intense.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The war in southwestern Shanxi is gradually spreading north. The Communist army in Hejin has been attacking north for days. Fierce fighting has already taken place in the suburbs of Xiangning and Jixian on the 3rd. After seven days and nights of bloody fighting in Puxian, north of Jishan, the National troops, due to a lack of ammunition, have been broken into the city by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The battle for the ferry crossing in Jin'er is being waged fiercely.

Two regiments of the Communist army have been fiercely attacking for two days.</p>
<h3>Allied Demands for Japanese Reparations Will Exceed One Trillion; Allied Headquarters Are Sorting Out Japanese Assets</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd, United Press] According to Brigadier General Tangxi, Director of the Property Management Office of the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan: "The Allied demands for reparations from Japan are currently being prepared, and the amount may exceed one trillion yuan. Japan is unable to pay this amount. Therefore, sorting out the reparations issue, the most important part of solving it, will include the distribution of many items, determining 'who gets what?'" Tang believes that decisions regarding the restoration of reparations goods to their original state and the payment of reparations claims should be made as soon as possible so that a peace treaty can be signed and Japan can restore its position in the international community. Allied Headquarters has listed the procedures for property restoration so that various important properties can be sorted out before the Allied countries sign the peace treaty. Tang said: "Japanese assets abroad are listed at 40 billion yuan. The largest part of this huge industry is in the Soviet-controlled areas, including the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and northern Korea. China also holds a large amount of Japanese property in Taiwan and the inland provinces."</p>
<p>Returning War-Time Looted Goods</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Tangxi, Director of the Property Management Office of the Allied Headquarters, told United Press: "The work of returning the looted goods during the war is now underway. There are a large number of looted goods, including cars, machines, artwork, antiques, books, and other items, which are still stored in Japanese warehouses. Before any item is returned, the government whose property was looted by Japan should first make a request, and the item must be proven to have been looted from its territory. There are still a large number of looted industrial machines that have not been identified by various countries. Therefore, no requests have been received for these materials. Some of the machines have already been proposed for reparations, but before the item is definitely assigned to a certain country, if definite evidence is presented to request its return, then the item will no longer be used as reparations, but instead will be returned to its original owner.</p>
<p>Looted property that has now been returned to its original owners includes the famous Pontianak crown, made of gold and diamonds, which has been returned to its original owner in the former Dutch East Indies. Another looted item returned to the Dutch East Indies is a collection of eighteen human skulls. Based on previous scientific research, it is inferred that these skulls belong to a person between the Java ape-man and modern human races. Other items returned to the Dutch East Indies include a war banner belonging to a certain cavalry regiment and several thousand books. Korea regained several ancient government seals and a ship. Australia recovered several books stolen from the Department of Agriculture and other government offices in Rabaul. Hong Kong recovered two firefighting machines, a large lathe, two bronze statues, a bronze drum, a ship, the Addies Moller, and 627 books believed to be owned by Major Boxer, the husband of American female writer Xiang Meili. The British Solomon Islands recovered a law library and books belonging to the Chief Justice's Library of the Western Pacific Commissioner's Court. China recovered books that previously belonged to the National Central Library, two chained iron anchors lost in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, specimens of Peking Man, and other books belonging to various schools, the Royal Asiatic Society, and individuals.</p>
<p>The Disposal of Large Amounts of Gold Bullion Has Not Yet Been Finalized</p>
<p>The delegations of compensation and recovery of original items from Australia, the Netherlands, France, the Philippines, China, and Canada have all arrived in Tokyo, and the delegations of the United States and other countries are expected to arrive in Tokyo within a day. The disposal of large amounts of gold bullion is awaiting a decision by senior authorities. The following ships are currently being repaired and equipped and are planned to be returned to their original owners: belonging to the UK are the Jintang, Torlys, Bias, Halman Moller, Yuexi Moller and Xin Yangzi, belonging to Panama is Romora. Belonging to the Philippines is Hilongdeler. Belonging to the United States is the Weivi. Belonging to Korea are fifteen fishing boats owned by Korea.

Two Communist Brigades detoured through Zhongyang County after passing through Liulin and Xiaoyi, threatening Fenyang and Xiaoyi.</p>
<h3>Cargo Unloading at Qikou Raises Various Speculations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 4th Dispatch] According to military authorities of the National Army, last night informed this reporter: They have obtained intelligence that a ship of unknown origin, possibly dispatched by UNRRA, is unloading goods of unknown nature at Qikou, which is 70 kilometers south of Tianjin and under Communist control. This news yesterday has caused rumors to spread in the Chinese press, claiming that the Soviet Union is arming the CCP at that location. However, these military authorities revealed that the initial intelligence claiming the ship belonged to the Soviet Union has since been proven to be false. The ship may be "a UNRRA vessel". This intelligence came from the coastal area above Qigu controlled by the National Army, stating that the ship docked there on April 25 and sailed away the same day after unloading a large amount of goods. Although further investigation is still underway, the relevant authorities do not believe the ship belongs to the Soviet Union. However, they also stated that the National Army has not received any notification from UNRRA that a ship is heading to Qikou.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] National Government Order of the 5th: The Organizational Regulations of the National Assembly Representative Election General Office are hereby repealed. This order. Now, the Organizational Regulations of the National Assembly Representative, Legislative Yuan Legislator Election General Office are hereby formulated and promulgated. This order.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Discusses Loan Issues: Balancing the Budget Cannot Rely on Foreign Debt; Foreign Loans Must Be Used for Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, when reporting at a Legislative Yuan meeting previously, mentioned the issue of American loans. Today, in response to reporters' inquiries, he further explained as follows: "How our government can achieve a balance of payments in the budget is indeed a major challenge at present. However, to solve this challenge, the government should first implement a self-help policy, gradually increasing tax revenues, reducing non-productive expenditures, and using methods such as domestic debt. It is harmful to rely on foreign debt to make up for budget overruns. However, our country has a vast area that needs to immediately begin economic recovery and construction work. The costs required for this type of work are naturally beyond the current capacity of our national treasury. In this regard, American loans are crucial. The government will strictly adhere to the common administrative guidelines declared by all parties participating in the government this time, that is, the raising of foreign debt must be limited to use for construction and production, as well as stabilizing and improving the economic life of the people."</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Comment: Praising Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] The Washington Daily News today wrote a commentary stating that Zhang Qun, the Premier of the Executive Yuan of the reorganized Chinese government, is now "off to a good start" in his self-admittedly difficult position. First, Mr. Zhang and his cabinet members have attended the Legislative Yuan to report and have asked the Legislative Yuan to discuss his plans. This is a new and encouraging change in the procedures of the Chinese government. Second, the new Premier, when announcing "Our government firmly believes that we should rely mainly on our own efforts and should not rely solely on external assistance," showed a sense of self-reliance. This indicates a new courage being injected into the Kuomintang government. The newspaper believes that if this implies that Chiang's government has decided to stabilize China's economy through sound internal measures, then it is indeed good news and worthy of encouragement. China's post-war reconstruction will undoubtedly require some external assistance, but if the Chinese government can demonstrate its strength in implementing its own construction and reform plans, then external assistance will be more rapid and promising.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] The Howard newspaper system wrote a commentary stating that since Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan of China took office, he has been determined to innovate. He has attended the Legislative Yuan to report on his plans. At the same time, Premier Zhang has demonstrated his confident ability, which shows that new momentum has been injected into the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Speaks to Reporters About the Domestic Situation After the Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng came to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him about the situation after the reorganization of the government. He said the following: The expansion of the government is based on the foundation laid down in the Political Consultative Conference. It has been more than a year since then and it has finally come to fruition. The Kuomintang is certainly gratified, and the people of the whole country and friendly nations must also feel excited. The twists and turns of discussions in various aspects over the past year are well known to the people of the country. It is a great regret that the Chinese Communist Party refused to participate in the government and was unwilling to jointly promote constitutional democracy. In the end, they even denied the constitution and used force to undermine peace!</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the National Government, the various parties participating in the government will work together to deliberate on appropriate solutions to the current economic problems of China and the problem of the Chinese Communist Party's armed resistance against the government. The solution to economic problems certainly requires friendly assistance, but the main thing is still self-reliance. Those who can help themselves will surely be helped by others.</p>
<p>Today, China's only way out is: first, to cultivate the foundation of democratic politics and implement constitutionalism. Therefore, the government's most arduous task this year is to hold various elections, convene the National Assembly as scheduled, and establish a constitutional government. Second, to use rapid and effective methods to urge the Chinese Communist Party to stop military actions and fully restore transportation. The Communist Party must become an ordinary legal political party and work together with the Kuomintang and other parties to achieve China's peaceful unification. Only then can China actively carry out various reforms and constructions on the right track of constitutionalism. Only then can the people live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
<p>China's stability and prosperity are closely related to the world's stability and prosperity. International tranquility and peace are also closely related to China's tranquility and peace. In order to fulfill its responsibility as a member of the international community, China must first seek its own peaceful unification. Although this matter is important, sincerity will eventually lead to the complete achievement of the goal, and the main conditions for its success are that the entire nation has confidence, can be patient, and has great perseverance.</p>

<h3>Closing Ceremony Held at Huayuankou; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions and Commendations; Memorial Service Held on the Same Day for Employees Who Sacrificed Their Lives for the Closure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] The closure project of the Huayuankou section of the Yellow River, which is related to the safety of hundreds of millions of lives and the prosperity of thousands of hectares of fertile land, was completed after arduous struggle and resistance. The historically significant closing ceremony was held on the 4th. The ceremony site was in the breach that was not long ago turbulent and full of dangers, but now it has become a solid and flat new embankment. Today, the embankment happened to be sunny after rain, and the wind was gentle and the sun was shining. The ceremony began at 9:00 am. Former Chairman Zhao Shouyu of the Yellow River Commission served as chairman. Minister of Water Resources Xue Dubi gave a speech at the meeting, and Director Zhu Guangcai of the Engineering Bureau reported on the construction process. Then, Chairman Chiang's instructions were read out, saying that the success of the closure was due to (1) clear responsibility, (2) effective cooperation, and (3) firm confidence. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Fan Hanjie of the Army Headquarters, Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province, Supervisor Miao Peicheng, Consultant Todd of the United Relief Organization, Consultant Qian Zongyuan of the Pinghan Railway, and Director Ma Jie of the Henan Branch delivered speeches separately. Finally, the county magistrates of Zheng County, Zhongmu, and other sixteen counties were awarded banners by the conference for their effective assistance in purchasing materials and hiring workers.

<p>The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions at the closing ceremony of the Huayuankou section of the Yellow River is as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Xue of the Ministry of Water Resources: Our country is based on agriculture, and the construction of water conservancy has always been a major government policy. Compared with the dikes of various rivers in the country, after a long period of resistance war, they have been in disrepair. Therefore, at the beginning of the victory, the competent authorities were instructed to start the river repair and defense work as soon as possible. The breach of the Yellow River at Huayuankou for eight years caused severe disasters. The closure of the breach and the restoration of the river are related to national planning, people's livelihood, and reconstruction. Efforts should be made to speed up the process. Fortunately, this matter has lasted for more than a year. Although the project is arduous, the dangers are numerous, the obstruction of human beings, and the unfavorable weather conditions have almost accompanied the project from beginning to end. Finally, the employees involved and the relevant authorities and local governments have relied on perseverance and hard work to achieve success. Not only do the people in the affected areas celebrate the tranquility together, but the national vitality is also easier to recover from now on. The great achievements and achievements are commendable. All senior officials have been awarded medals by the National Government. The remaining employees who have contributed should be commended by the minister on their behalf and given preferential treatment to recognize their meritorious service. As for how to strengthen the dam body in the future to prevent major floods, how to find ways to complete the downstream levee restoration work to facilitate drainage, and how to revive the affected areas to help the disaster victims, all parties should still cooperate, be conscientious and responsible, and continue to work hard to achieve complete success. I have high hopes for this. Zhongzheng, Mao, Xian, Yin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] The memorial service for the employees who sacrificed their lives for the Yellow River damming project was held at the Huayuankou Dam Restoration Bureau at 2:00 pm on the 4th.

The families of the employees who sacrificed their lives will be given preferential treatment.

<h3>Editorial: The National Government's Return to the Capital: One Year Anniversary</h3>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the National Government's triumphant return to the capital. Recalling this day a year ago, the entire nation was immersed in the glory of victory, and the enthusiasm for celebrating the National Government's return was fervent! The expectations for domestic politics after the return to the capital were equally urgent! But today, a year later, reflecting on the past, the fruits of that glorious victory have already rotted away; looking to the future, the prospects are bleak. Therefore, as we commemorate this great day of the triumphant return to the capital today, our feelings are truly mixed.</p>
<p>First, the clarification of the political situation and the implementation of constitutional governance still require redoubled efforts from the entire nation, both government and public. On this day a year ago, the Political Consultative Conference had just concluded successfully. The Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction and the plan for the reorganization and unified command of the armed forces that it passed, although not yet implemented, still offered great hope because peace talks were underway with the mediation of Allied mediators, making the National Government's return to the capital the beginning of peaceful national reconstruction. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists were obsessed with the omnipotence of military force and sought to expand their territory by force. They consistently failed to understand this, leading to a situation where the peace talks anticipated by the whole country were elusive, resulting in a cycle of fighting and negotiating, and negotiating and fighting. This ultimately left Marshal George C. Marshall, the tireless mediator, helpless, and he had to acknowledge his failure and quietly return home. Since then, the peace talks have never been restored. This episode of the peace talks can be said to be the most heartbreaking and disappointing. However, from another perspective, the government, for the sake of peace, spared no effort in repeatedly making concessions to the Chinese Communists. The breakdown of the peace talks was not the government's fault and the Chinese Communists should bear full responsibility. At the same time, for the sake of democracy, the government everywhere demonstrated the spirit of doing its best, regardless of the obstruction of the Chinese Communists and the Democratic League, and still followed the original plan, step by step, embarking on the road to preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance. The convening of the National Assembly in November last year and the drafting of the new Constitution, no matter how they are interpreted, cannot but be regarded as a major achievement of the government's efforts to promote political democratization after its return to the capital. Not only that, but the government, in order to ensure the success of the implementation of constitutional governance, also voluntarily reorganized the government, recruiting members of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, as well as social elites, to expand the democratic foundation of the government, and successfully completed the reorganization last month. The newly appointed Premier Zhang Qun, with the demeanor of a new statesman, came forward to govern, revealing his principles of governance for the future: first, to implement a system where the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan on a trial basis; second, to continue to seek a political solution to the Chinese Communist problem. This immediately gave the domestic political situation a new look, and therefore, in the hearts of the people across the country, infinite hope has arisen again. However, from our perspective, the hope that the people now have for the future of politics is still vague and requires redoubled efforts from the entire nation, both government and public, especially the sudden realization of the Chinese Communists, to immediately lay down their arms, so that the whole country can turn swords into plowshares. From then on, the domestic political situation can be clarified, and the implementation of the Constitution starting on December 25th of this year will blossom with democracy.</p>
<p>Second, the nationalization of the armed forces should be achieved at any cost. A year ago, when the National Government returned to the capital, the people across the country were all eager for the realization of domestic peace; and they unanimously believed that the implementation of the reorganization and unified command of the armed forces, making the nationalization of the armed forces nationwide, was the best way to ensure domestic peace and unity. Therefore, the people of the country were constantly looking forward to the nationalization of the armed forces. But as of today, not only has this hope been shattered, but the flames of war have spread across half of China. North China, Northeast China, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Shaanxi, and the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi have all suffered from the poison of the Chinese Communist Party's separatist rule. Although the Chinese Communists have repeatedly suffered defeats in military terms, and even Yan'an, which served as the "Chinese Communist Area" for issuing orders, has been recovered by the National Army, the Chinese Communists' delusion has not yet been cleared; and they have placed all their hopes on their guerrilla strategy, and they are foolishly attempting to economically drag down the National Government. Therefore, there is no hope of ending the domestic war for the time being, and the nationalization of the armed forces nationwide is even more out of the question at this point. We certainly also acknowledge that the government's use of force against the Chinese Communists is out of necessity; because the government has an unshirkable responsibility to maintain domestic transportation and protect the lives and property of the people, so it cannot turn a blind eye to the Chinese Communists who use force to destroy transportation and disrupt public order, and it has no choice but to take decisive action so that the people of the country can live and work in peace. However, we still hope that the government can have a comprehensive plan for military affairs. It must restore peace domestically in the shortest possible time, and earnestly fulfill the nationalization of the armed forces, so that domestic peace and unity can be maintained permanently from then on.</p>
<p>Third, the government should prioritize stabilizing the people's livelihood in the economy. During the eight years of bloody war, the people of the whole country were either constantly moving with the army, wandering and displaced, or remained in the occupied areas, suffering the exploitation of the enemy and puppets, moaning and haggard, with unspeakable suffering. Who would not hope to reduce the pain in life after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? Therefore, when the National Government returned to the capital last year, the people across the country hoped that the government would take action in the economy and finance to relieve the people's distress; but in the past year, because of the inability to balance finances, inflation was unavoidable, resulting in soaring prices, which made the common people struggle on the brink of starvation, with a sense of unease, as if they might not see the next day. The pain of being oppressed by life even exceeded wartime life! If this dangerous situation is not remedied, the subsequent consequences will be unimaginable. Premier Zhang recently admitted frankly to the Legislative Yuan that "the current economy is extremely difficult, which has a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood, and we should strive for a balance of payments." He also stated that economic problems should be solved by economic methods, which shows that the government authorities are also paying attention to the current national economy and people's livelihood, but we cannot but point out that the severity of the threat to the people's livelihood from the crazy rise in prices exceeds that of floods or fires, and suppressing the rising trend of prices is like putting out a fire to save lives. The first priority is to rush to the scene promptly and take immediate action. If we see a disaster and do not provide relief, but retreat and study disaster relief methods at length, it will inevitably be too late. To be honest, since the economic difficulties have developed to such a serious point, all denials and cover-ups cannot overcome the facts; the government authorities can only face reality, face difficulties, and vigorously implement practical and concrete measures. The British government's approach to dealing with economic difficulties is most worthy of our reference. In the future, all administrative measures should take stabilizing the people's livelihood as the highest guiding principle. We should save all unnecessary expenses, eliminate all redundant personnel, and improve administrative efficiency. Even matters that should be promoted and reformed should be divided into stages. Matters that are not related to stabilizing the people's livelihood can be temporarily suspended. As for the ever-rising prices, we should take bold measures and implement a new economic policy. All measures should be based on statistical figures. If we want to control them, we should strive for thoroughness, not stop until we achieve our goals, and not stop until they are effective.</p>
<p>In short, today is the first anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. All past events are like yesterday's death, and all future events are like today's birth. Looking forward to the future of domestic politics, although there are few optimistic elements and many places for pessimism, everything depends on human effort. The people of the whole country still hope that the reorganized government can use the new style of the new government to overcome the current political and economic difficulties.</p>

<h3>Important Vote Held in French Parliament, Government Wins Vote of Confidence, Communist Party Members All Vote Against, Prime Minister's Future Movements Deserve Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 4th, broadcast: The Ramadier government won a great victory in the French parliament today with a vote of confidence, but the Communist Party's last-minute decision to oppose the government has foreshadowed a reorganization of the coalition cabinet. The vote count in the French parliament today was revealed as follows: 360 votes of confidence, 186 votes against, and 63 abstentions. Most members expressed their support, but Ramadier still stood up and demanded that the Communist Party state its position. Ramadier said: "We must have a clear decision. If you oppose me, please do not vote for a vote of confidence. France is currently facing serious difficulties, and only the implementation of iron discipline can save the crisis." After Ramadier finished speaking, the Communist Party unanimously voted against the vote of confidence, but the other parties supported Ramadier. Today's result proves that Ramadier has only two paths to follow: one is to replace the Communist Party officials who hold important cabinet positions with members of other parties, and the other is to offer his resignation. It has not yet been decided which steps Ramadier will take.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] The French parliament will face a vote today that may cause a split between the Communist Party and other French parties. Premier Ramadier has requested a vote of confidence on his price and wage policy. The underlying meaning is whether parties other than the Communist Party are prepared to abandon the participation of the Communist Party and the support of the Communist Party-controlled unions and implement governance. If a coalition government is formed in France without the participation of the Communist Party, it will be the first time since the liberation in 1944. This attempt will undoubtedly be a prelude to a period of political turmoil in France. The Communist Party has strong control over major unions and is prepared to lead unions to demand higher wages. Those who oppose the Communist Party's high-wage policy say that in order to stop inflation and maintain the current value of the currency, wages should be frozen, at least in the current stage. After the economic issues, the Communist Party and other parties also have widely divergent views on foreign policy. The Communist Party is deeply dissatisfied with the increasingly pro-British and American and anti-Soviet stance of other party leaders since the Moscow Conference. Although there may still be a last glimmer of hope for maintaining the four-party coalition government, the Socialist Party is particularly unwilling to cause a full-scale cabinet crisis. Members of the Socialist Party in parliament have spent the whole day studying appropriate ways to allow metalworkers to obtain better treatment without violating the principle of freezing wages, while the Radical Party, the Gaullist Party, and the People's Republican Movement, including Foreign Minister Bidault, are firmly opposed to compromise with the Communist Party. They believe that the metalworkers' demand to increase production bonuses does not correspond to the increase in production volume and is actually a disguised demand to increase wages. In addition, the Radical Party also believes that the current government has not been able to give the free industry sufficient freedom, so it hopes to reorganize the government and exclude the main architect of the cabinet, the Socialist Party's Minister of National Economy, Philip. Several French newspapers pointed out that the current government crisis has exposed some peculiar weaknesses in the constitution. The Communist Party refused to vote for a vote of confidence in the government's economic policy today, but the government can still win a majority vote of confidence. At the same time, Communist Party cabinet members have stated that regardless of the outcome of the vote, they do not intend to resign, and Premier Ramadier has no way to force the Communist Party cabinet members to resign. Therefore, Ramadier can only lead all cabinet members to resign. Therefore, the resignation of the French government is due to the fact that the majority of the parliament has passed a vote of confidence in the government. This phenomenon is unique in the world.</p>
<h3>French Communist Party Clarifies Position: Supports Union Demands, Opposes "Policy of Force"</h3>
<p>[France Press, Paris, 3rd] The Central Committee of the French Communist Party recently issued a declaration instructing Communist Party members of the National Assembly to support the union's demands for wage increases and to oppose the continued implementation of a "policy of force" within the French Federation. It also advocated for major cuts in military spending to balance the national budget, and for the implementation of a foreign policy that would allow France to obtain Ruhr coal and reparations. Finally, it expressed disappointment with the situation after the November 1946 elections, believing that violations of democratic regulations prevented the formation of a government that represented the will of the people and was led by the Communist Party. The declaration stated, in part: The government's efforts to suppress prices have failed, but France needs to provide food, clothing, and shelter for the people, and needs to stabilize the value of the franc and the national budget. It is particularly necessary to make major cuts in military spending to balance it. In terms of foreign policy, France should establish lasting and just peace, and seek reparations and the right to Ruhr coal. Regarding the empire itself, it is appropriate to end the policy of force, so as not to be taken advantage of by certain imperialists, causing the French Federation to be divided. It is hoped that Communist Party members will unanimously adhere to this attitude and vote according to this position in parliament. The Central Committee then urged the Socialist Party workers to unite with them to oppose the reactionary forces. It said: "The unified action of the working class can become the decisive factor in the comprehensive unity of the Republic." The Central Committee finally appealed to other parties to redouble their efforts to jointly seek the revival of the country, the welfare of the people, the protection of democracy, and the independence of France.</p>
<h3>US Authorities in Germany Do Not Allow Another Organization to Form the Unified Party</h3>

<h3>Jesus Statue: Wounds Bleeding</h3>
<p>Catholic Believers Vie to See Miracle</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 3rd] Thousands of Italian Catholic believers flocked to the church in La Spezia today to see the miracle of blood flowing from the wounds of Jesus on the cross. The priest of the church said that it was caused by the reflection of light on the oil paint of the wounds. However, some believers said that the Eucharist on the cross was indeed bleeding, and said that this miracle also occurred in 1635. It is said that the cross was made in 1300.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations: Some Progress Made</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have been underway for two weeks. It is now known that the British delegation has decided to extend its stay by one week in order to continue negotiations with the Soviet authorities, because the negotiations have made considerable progress, so the British side is particularly unwilling to interrupt them. It is understood that although the British delegation will not bring back to its country the trade agreement that will be agreed upon soon, it will be able to establish broad principles for restoring Anglo-Soviet trade on the basis of the 1934 agreement. To date, negotiations have been limited to the items that both parties intend to supply, as well as technical issues related to the conclusion of shipping contracts.</p>
<h3>UN Political Committee to Discuss Today: Investigation Team Organization Issues, Jewish Representatives Attend, No Agreement Reached on Major Case</h3>
<p>[France Press, New York, 3rd] When the Political Committee of the United Nations Special General Assembly meets on the 5th, it will discuss the establishment of the Palestine investigation team and the definition of its powers. These two issues will force the representatives to address the core of the Palestine issue. The Political Committee has two issues that need to be resolved. One is to establish an investigation committee to prepare a report to be submitted to the UN General Assembly regular session in January of this year. The second is to allow representatives of the Jewish Public Assembly to present their views. The first point is more important than the second, because it involves the entire Palestine issue. Although the delegations are trying to avoid a comprehensive discussion, it seems difficult to avoid this circle. Although the representatives want to give the investigation committee broad powers, they have divergent opinions on its organization. Currently, there are two arguments. One faction favors the investigation committee being composed of members from neutral countries, the so-called neutral countries being countries that are not directly related to this issue. The five permanent members of the Security Council and the Arab countries are not included. The other faction argues that the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Arab countries should be included together. The United States favors the former argument, and the United Kingdom is expected to follow suit. Small countries are opposed, believing that the Palestine issue can only be resolved by the five permanent members in the end. If the five permanent members are included in the investigation committee, it can solve some difficult problems in advance. The Soviet Union and France support this argument.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 3rd] The United Nations Special General Assembly debated the case of whether Jewish representatives should attend the meeting to present their views on the Palestine issue this afternoon for four hours without result. The United States and the Soviet Union had very different views. The United States argued that Jewish representatives could only participate in the debate on the Palestine issue in the Political Committee, while the Soviet Union strongly argued that Jewish representatives could speak at the plenary session. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m., and there were still eight representatives who had prepared to express their views according to the plan who had not had time to speak, but the arguments for and against had already been fully stated in the Steering Committee. Chairman Aranha hoped to reconvene the meeting tonight to make a resolution, but in order to comply with the wishes of the majority of the representatives, he adjourned the meeting until 11 a.m. on the 5th for further discussion. Soviet Representative Gromyko said that listening to the presentation of the Jewish representatives would increase the dignity of the General Assembly. "If we want to obtain a just decision, we must allow Jewish representatives to attend the plenary session."</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly Holds Welcome Reception; Mexican President Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Linluxing Grassland, 3rd] Mexican President Alemán, who came to the United States for consultation, has arrived here. The United Nations General Assembly held a welcome reception for him today. After the President of the General Assembly, Aranha, delivered a welcoming speech, President Alemán delivered a speech stating that only through mutual cooperation can we overcome the various difficulties that have arisen after the war and transform this unstable period into true peace. In short, I hope that when you discuss various issues, you can always be guided by harmony and justice.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Build Battleships Powered by Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] The Admiralty announced today that the government will seek to build atomic-powered battleships and plans to launch a large-scale research effort to maintain naval efficiency. This year, various naval research projects will cost as much as $24 million. Naval facilities must apply the lessons learned by observers in the Bikini atomic bomb tests, but the essence of atomic energy quickly does not limit the navy to defensive aspects. The initial impression is the opposite, and it will lead to an increase in naval power, a high degree of formal innovation, and an expansion of offensive and defensive tasks. Atomic-powered battleships have no refueling problems, and their stay at sea is limited only by other secondary supply issues. At the same time, the Department of Supply announced that a school will be opened in the state-owned atomic energy plant in Stirling Firth, Northern Ireland, to train young people over the age of 14 to engage in atomic work.</p>
<h3>British Shipbuilding Program</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Britain, whose shipping capacity has lagged behind the United States, is trying to catch up quickly to restore its position as the world's leading shipping nation. In addition to orders placed abroad, the shipbuilding target for this year in Britain is 1.25 million tons. The fuel crisis and the shortage of steel and timber will inevitably have some impact on the shipbuilding program, but the amount of the reduction cannot be estimated at present. This year's production, with the exception of one-quarter, will be added to the British merchant fleet, whose total tonnage has fallen to only 24 percent of the world's tonnage, totaling 24,009,600 tons, while the total tonnage of the American merchant fleet is 50,389,000 tons. Britain currently leases 229 merchant ships from the United States, and the British government has decided to spend US$100 million to buy 142 of them. In terms of tonnage, it will take many years for Britain to regain its throne as the world's leading shipping nation, but the equipment of British merchant ships is becoming more and more refined.</p>

<h3>Iraq and Transjordan Sign Ten-Year Treaty of Friendship</h3>

The treaty does not contain financial or educational provisions.</p>
<h3>Muslim League Insists on Partition; Unification of India Hopeless; Ismay Returns to Britain to Urge Government to Take Timely Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The Sunday Times correspondent in New Delhi stated that according to information obtained from very high authorities, Lord Ismay, a senior aide to the Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, went to London to urge the British Cabinet to take timely action to avoid the complete collapse of Indian administration. The India Office fears that India will inevitably fall into chaos before Britain withdraws from India in June next year. The Governor-General's report specifically pointed out that there is no possibility that the Congress Party and the Muslim League will reach an agreement on the unification of India. The independent state demanded by the Muslim League includes six provinces: Sindh, Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Balochistan, Bengal, and Assam. However, the Congress Party does not want to cede Assam, eastern Punjab, and western Bengal, where non-Muslims constitute the majority of the population. In the Northwest Frontier Province, the Congress Party may be able to make concessions. Therefore, the Governor-General of India hopes to hold a referendum in the disputed areas to determine who they belong to. The recognition of Pakistan has led to some demands for continued partition. The Governor-General believes that the earlier the transfer of power is implemented, the smaller the support for these demands will be. Regarding taxation, immigration, and the military, it will not be possible to separate them for several years. Therefore, the Governor-General suggests that committees be appointed by Pakistan and Hindustan to take over the transitional administration of these affairs to prepare for the final separation. If the Muslim League only obtains an incomplete Pakistan, it is expected that it will launch a long-term struggle to recover the divided motherland. Conversely, if it obtains a complete Pakistan, the Congress Party will not be willing to accept it. Under these circumstances, the strength of both sides will not be able to focus on the restoration of the agricultural, industrial, and social system. In the development of these opinions, some people have suggested that the British Cabinet should consider having Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union jointly guarantee the sovereignty of India.</p>

<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade; United States Sets Date for Restoration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The State Department has tentatively set July 15 as the date for various countries to resume private commercial activities with Japan. An authoritative source told reporters today that a mixed delegation composed of the State Department, the Army Department, the Treasury Department, and the Department of Commerce will depart for Japan this week to hold final discussions with MacArthur.

<h3>Enthusiastic Commemoration of the May Fourth Movement; City Gymnasium Holds Grand Meeting; Announcement of Sixteen Winners of Youth Day Essay Contest</h3>

On the one hand, we express our admiration for the spirit of the great May Fourth Movement 28 years ago. On the other hand, we deeply feel that we have made very little contribution to the country and the nation, and we are extremely ashamed. Recalling the May Fourth Movement, although young people had vigorous vigor and determination to transform society, they had two shortcomings: (1) no long-term vision, (2) no practical methods, only knowing that they were dissatisfied with the status quo, but not knowing how to proceed gradually to make effective reforms. We should remember this lesson today. You are the masters of the future. You should work hard, study hard, not be boastful, not sing high-pitched tunes, and carefully observe any problems, study their causes, and do them practically, so as to assume the responsibility of building the country and society.</p>

Then, Zhang Daofan delivered a speech saying: "I am very excited to be attending the founding meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association on this Literary Festival. The May Fourth Movement of the 28th year shifted from politics to culture. Up to today, the democratic politics of our country have laid a preliminary foundation and are moving forward. It can be said that 'the spirit of the May Fourth Movement has achieved preliminary results.' However, in order to continue to move forward, we must not stand still. We need to expand the opportunities for writers to learn from each other in order to make further progress.

More than 300 members attended. First, Xu Enzeng, chairman of the General Association, delivered a speech saying: "I remember that when the Sino-Japanese War began, a group of brave young radio personnel responded to the national mobilization plan and were willing to serve the country. At that time, I was in charge of the Sixth Department of the Military Commission, so the Sixth Department established the Wartime Service Corps of Chinese Amateur Radio Personnel. In the 29th year, it was reorganized into a people's academic group, which was renamed the current name. The annual meeting is always held on May 5. We have three missions: (1) We love science. Science is the truth that has been tested. Grasp the truth, distinguish right from wrong, and we will follow this path. (2) Our country is a country with a developed metaphysics. Not only is it unclear about right and wrong, but it is also difficult to quickly promote all material construction and production methods. Our love of science is to popularize drawing knowledge in order to accelerate the achievement of national prosperity and happiness. (3) Loving drawing and loving experimentation will inevitably lead to many inventions and many achievements over time, so as to increase social welfare. At the same time, the problem of one's own life will also be solved, and there will be no more phenomenon of fighting for this and robbing from that, which is beneficial to both people and oneself. I sincerely hope that all members will still maintain the spirit of the past and contribute to the country and the nation."</p>
<p>Then, Yu Bingjian, director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, delivered a speech, saying: "During the Anti-Japanese War, our amateur radio operators made a significant contribution. In addition to publishing books, radio publications, holding academic lectures, giving the people radio knowledge, and holding radio exhibitions, they also actively organized to serve the country, manufacturing military transceivers, helping the government train communication personnel, undertaking important communication tasks, and conducting international propaganda. Before the war, we were still lingering in the 20-meter, 10-meter, and 5-meter wavelengths. Now we have progressed to 2-meter, 1-meter, and even several-centimeter radar research. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that to study Western science, we must catch up head-on. This is the easiest and most promising thing for radio."</p>
<p>After Mr. Yu's speech, the association originally invited Zhao Zeng, the head of the three offices, to deliver a speech.

<h3>Plans for Severe Punishment of Unscrupulous Merchants; Those Found Will Be Punished with the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] It has recently been confirmed that the authorities are considering proper measures to crack down on hoarding and price manipulation. Currently, unscrupulous merchants found to be hoarding are only subject to administrative penalties and short-term detention, which is not enough to punish the unscrupulous and appease public anger. The authorities have recently planned that, in the future, goods found to be hoarding, including daily necessities such as rice, coal, oil, sugar, yarn, cloth, and salt, will be confiscated and sold publicly at a fair price by the authorities. As for the unscrupulous merchants who hoard, they will be punished with the death penalty in accordance with the regulations on hoarding essential goods for the people's livelihood during extraordinary times. Once the plan is submitted to the central government for approval, it will be officially implemented.</p>
<h3>Two Rice Stores Hoard Prices; Store Owners Summoned for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sanxin Rice Store in Zhenhejing Town, Huxi, was found to be selling white rice for 240,000 yuan per stone yesterday afternoon by plainclothes police Zhou Shiji and others from the Longhua Police Sub-bureau.

<h3>More Than a Thousand Young People Carry Coffins in Procession; Gongs Sound All the Way; Unscrupulous Merchants Tremble with Fear</h3>
<p>The large-scale procession to suppress prices and expose unscrupulous merchants launched by the Shanghai Vocational Youth Association was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a thousand vocational youths gathered at Jing'an Temple, led by the national flag and the commander's car, followed by gongs on all four sides. They then held up huge banners with slogans such as "Expose Unscrupulous Merchants and Suppress Prices," "Where is the Conscience of Unscrupulous Merchants," "Use Heavy Penalties in a Chaotic World," and "Down with Bureaucratic Capital." They also had a large complaint box for passersby to submit complaints at any time. There were also various fascinating programs interspersed, such as rice, coal, oil, cloth, and Western medicine spreading their wings and flying high, somersaults in copper coin eyes, and reaching out for money from the coffin. The procession passed through Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, the Municipal Government, Hankou Road, Henan Road, Zhongzheng East Road, the Great World, Xizang South Road, Linsen Middle Road, Zhongzheng South First Road, Zhongzheng North First Road, and ended at Nanjing West Road.

<p>For the sake of solemnity, the association specially sent the complaint box to the Garrison Headquarters after the procession, where the headquarters was responsible for opening it. Representatives from the Vocational Youth Association will also participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Social Services; Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>(1) Store Closure</p>
<p>Li Zhijun asks: I suffered a huge loss due to the closure of a certain store. The store owner has absconded without a trace, leaving only the rented storefront and a few pieces of equipment. May I ask (1) can I accuse him of fraud? (2) Can the store's assets be used to compensate for the debt? (3) Can I use the store's receipt as proof of my claim?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duan Bukai's reply] (1) The crime of fraud under criminal law requires the intention to illegally possess something for oneself or a third party and to use fraudulent means to have someone deliver their own or a third party's property. If the store owner had the above-mentioned intention and behavior, he should be held liable for the crime of fraud. (2) If the inheritance has already begun, then yes. (3) No.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Miao Shaohai asks: I have an older brother who is married and is naturally dissolute. He does not engage in proper work and has addictions. My father repeatedly advised him, but he would not listen. Once, my older brother was drunk and wanted to chop my father to death with an axe. Fortunately, my father managed to escape and was not harmed. Therefore, there was an irreconcilable hatred between the two of them. One night eight years ago, my older brother was murdered. My father is suspected of absconding and has been living in fear ever since. Now that eight years have passed, does my sister-in-law still have the right to pursue legal action? Also, does the government's amnesty order exempt my father from the crime of suspicion?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duan Senkai's reply] Your father instigated others to kill your older brother, which is a crime of instigating murder under Article 29 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law, a person who commits murder shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years. According to the provisions of Item C of the government's amnesty order, the death penalty is reduced to imprisonment for a term of fifteen years; life imprisonment is reduced to imprisonment for a term of ten years; imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years is reduced to imprisonment for a term of not less than five years; it is not a complete pardon. Therefore, the court can still exercise its authority to prosecute and judge. To this day, your sister-in-law is permitted by law to request the court to punish the murderer in accordance with legal procedures. If unlawful means are used for retaliation, then one should bear legal responsibility.</p>
<p>Girl Waiting to be Claimed: The girl Chen Dezhu (claiming to be) was lost and crying on Kulun Road at 11:00 a.m. on the 7th.

<h3>Jinghua Company Vandalized, Press Conference Held</h3>
<p>Regarding the vandalism of the Jinghua Glass Company by glass workers from other factories, the Shanghai Industrial Association hosted a press conference at the Banker's Club yesterday. Xu Zhaohe, the manager of Jinghua, reported on the truth of the destruction, stating that due to the continuous need to operate the large glass melting furnace during Labor Day, some workers were still working at the factory and were being paid double wages by the factory. Unexpectedly, at noon on that day, hundreds of workers holding the flag of the Glass Industry Workers' Union rushed into the factory and vandalized the office, workshop, warehouse, and the doors, windows, and equipment in various places, with an estimated loss of 450 million yuan. It was also stated that this matter is a small loss for the company, but has a large impact on social stability, so it will be reported to relevant authorities, hoping to ensure the safety of manufacturers in the future and severely punish the instigators. It is said that the workers of the association were not members of the union, so this may have been the cause of this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Three Methods Under Consideration for Placing Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The authorities are greatly concerned about the placement of unemployed workers in Shanghai. The Social Affairs Bureau took advantage of the visit of Gu Zhenggang and Lu Jingshi to Shanghai to hold a meeting to discuss this issue. However, due to the economic recession, there is still no good solution. According to Director Lu Jingshi, there are three aspects under consideration for placement: (1) When Japanese reparations materials arrive to build factories, these unemployed workers will be absorbed, but the timing of this is still far away. (2) They will be introduced to work in various factories, but due to the industrial recession, a large number cannot be accommodated. (3) A portion of the unemployed workers will be sent back to their hometowns. This matter involves various difficulties, but is also under consideration.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Fifth Special Broadcast Zhang Daofan Lectures, Elaborating on the Political and Cultural Significance of the May Fourth Movement, Hoping that the "Association of Writers" Provides Good Spiritual Nourishment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This newspaper's fifth special weekly broadcast was held yesterday at the Oriental Huamei Broadcasting Station on Tibet Road. Mr. Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, was invited to lecture on "The Significance of Commemorating the May Fourth Movement and the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association." The full text of the speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Twenty-eight years ago, a patriotic student movement occurred in Peiping. It was originally a political movement, but later developed into a cultural movement and had a great relationship with literature and art. During the May Fourth Movement, two slogans were put forward: 'We want democracy! We want science!' Because at that time, politics was entirely in a state of autocracy, and academic culture was even more out of the question. The country was both poor and weak, so this patriotic movement occurred, demanding political democratization and advocating science to catch up. Now, when we think about the progress of political democratization in the past 28 years, we feel great comfort. After the May Fourth Movement, through the efforts of the people all over the country, especially under the leadership of the Kuomintang, the movement to protect the constitution and the Northern Expedition in 1926 successively eliminated the warlords and unified China.</p>
<p>Political Democracy is Now a Reality</p>
<p>At that time, there was a very good opportunity to realize democracy, but because the Communist Party in the country was causing trouble, occupying the Anhui and Jiangxi area, plotting to communize, and instigating riots, the government was forced to engage in suppression and could not embark on the road of construction. Later, the September 18th Incident occurred, and Japanese warlords launched the incident to prevent China from unifying. At that time, the national strength was weak, and there was no military preparation, so we had to endure humiliation and delay the enemy in order to prepare more. Until it became unbearable and there was no way to retreat, we launched the full-scale war of resistance on July 7th. After eight years of war, we finally won the final victory. Originally, in order to realize democracy, the Kuomintang had already stipulated the three stages of military administration, tutelage, and constitutional government in the party program before the war, but the tutelage period can be said to have not been completed due to the enemy's sabotage. Now, more than a year after the victory, because there is a need to implement constitutional government ahead of schedule, the National Assembly was convened last year to formulate the constitution. After this year's National Assembly elections, the constitution can be implemented. The recent reorganization of the government is also aimed at realizing constitutional government ahead of schedule. All these facts are enough to show that the "political democratization" proposed by the May Fourth Movement now has results.</p>
<p>Developing Literature and Art Should be Valued Even More</p>
<p>As for science, although it has not yet caught up with European and American countries, there has been a lot of progress. Secondly, let's talk about the cultural movement unfolded by the May Fourth Movement. Literature and art are the main departments in culture, and should be given special attention. Now the United Nations has an educational, cultural, and scientific organization, and the cultural department also focuses on literature and art, so the development of literature and art should not only be sought domestically, but also abroad, in order to win the attention of democratic countries to me. During the War of Resistance, the literary and art circles had considerable progress, and there were various organizations. Now that the war has ended, in the process of national construction, this link of literature and art cannot be ignored, and we need to work harder. At present, the level of domestic literature and art is still not satisfactory. For example, novels and movies have made considerable progress, but the achievements of poetry and other genres are too poor. If we compare them with European and American countries, we feel even more ashamed. Therefore, how to seek the development of literature and art, so that established writers are not only famous in the country, but also enjoy fame internationally, and how to enable young writers to be assisted by established writers and achieve something, depends not only on government assistance and social sympathy, but especially on their own efforts. Therefore, there is a need to organize groups to help each other, learn from each other, and seek everyone's welfare.</p>
<p>The Literary Association Has Great Significance</p>
<p>Now the cultural organization of the United Nations has launched every country participating in it to establish a committee in the country, composed of sound literary and art organizations. Like the United States, there are more than 1,000. In the past, China could not talk about having a sound organization. It was not until the beginning of the year before last that the Literary Association General Association was established in Chongqing, and it was moved to Nanjing after the victory. At the first annual meeting this year, it was decided to establish a literary writers association in Shanghai, because Shanghai is the center of the country's culture and needs this organization even more to unite outstanding writers. The "Shanghai Literary Association" was officially established today after a considerable period of preparation. Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, which is a memorial day for the transformation of a political movement into a cultural movement, and is therefore of particular significance. It is hoped that the society will attach importance to this organization and use various methods to support and encourage the development of literature and art and literary and art writers. Moreover, literary and art writers are providers of spiritual food. People, regardless of their wealth, gender, age, or youth, have the same need for spiritual food, but the quality of spiritual food is very different. Apart from a few writers with ulterior motives, good spiritual food can benefit people's physical and mental cultivation. Toxic, or low-level, obscene, and depraved spiritual food is not only useless, but also harmful. Therefore, it is hoped that literary and art writers will come up with good spiritual food, and that social readers will have a clear understanding and give strict criticism and severe blows to bad literary and art works, so as to make literature and art embark on the road of good development and cooperate with the important task of national construction in the future.</p>

<h3>Great Relocation Movement of Yingshi University Expanded, Students of All Departments on Strike Since the 2nd, Petition Delegation Preparing to go to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinhua] The students of the Law, Agriculture, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences of the National Yingshi University, who launched the relocation movement, expressed dissatisfaction with Minister Zhu's statement in Hangzhou that "the location of the school should not be changed", and have been on strike since May 2nd.

(2) The expenses of the petition delegation have been approved by all the students and borrowed from the subsidy fees for public-funded students in May, June, and July. (3) To appeal to people from all walks of life to quickly determine the permanent location of the school and welcome the Ministry of Education to send personnel to Jin to conduct an on-site inspection. The students of the school are extremely nervous. The school sports meeting originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month has been suspended. Most of the heads of various offices are avoiding meeting. The new president has been promised by Minister Zhu to be announced on the day he returns to Beijing, but under the current situation, whether the new president can come is extremely questionable.</p>

More than 60 parents attended and unanimously agreed that the students from the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School had entered the girls' school, which was established at the same address, and wantonly vandalized public property, which was extremely arrogant. The authorities of the Municipal Normal School should immediately hand over the students who caused the trouble and punish them severely, and should not shirk responsibility. They decided to submit a report to the relevant authorities for a thorough investigation. Moreover, Wuben is a girls' school with a long history in the city, and it was moved to its current location last autumn. It shares a school building with the Municipal Normal School, which enrolls boys, and the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School, and the distribution of use has not been resolved reasonably. For example, Wuben has 15 classes, while the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School has only 5 classes, but in the proportion of school building allocation, Wuben only accounts for 30 to 40 percent, so that even the places under the stairs with extremely insufficient light are also used as classrooms. Such a situation clearly despises girls' education. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to request the relevant authorities to allocate an independent and complete school building to Wuben Girls' Middle School as soon as possible to fundamentally solve the problem.</p>

<h3>How to Be a Nation-Building Youth in the Great Era That Ended the Eight-Year War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jixi</p>
<p>Can a prosperous and democratic new China be built in this great era? It depends entirely on whether we, this generation of young people, have strong physiques, noble characters, scientific knowledge, and democratic cultivation. If all the young people in our country possess the above-mentioned qualities, then everyone deserves to be called a nation-building youth. A brand-new, modern, and powerful East Asian country will surely be built and prosper in our hands. Therefore, whether our great cause of nation-building can be launched quickly and completed smoothly depends entirely on whether we, this generation of young people, can be nation-building youths. So, "how to be a nation-building youth"? Now, I would like to offer a few humble opinions and encourage young friends across the country who are ambitious, promising, and principled.</p>
<p>Improving Health Standards</p>
<p>First, to be a nation-building youth, we must improve our health standards. According to recently published figures, there are currently 1.16 million young students receiving education in middle schools in our country. However, because our compatriots are generally very poor, most young people are often malnourished, their bodies are aging prematurely, and they are weak and sickly. As a result, only 1% of the young people who applied for the air force passed the physical examination, and only 1-2% of those who applied for the navy passed the physical examination. How can such unhealthy young people build a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy new China? There is a very popular saying in England: "A nation with third-rate physiques cannot create a first-rate country." We young people are the new citizens of the country and the vital force for nation-building. With such weak and sickly young people, I am afraid that we do not even qualify as third-rate citizens, so how can we build a first-rate power? Therefore, to create a truly first-rate country that lives up to its name, and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the three major powers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and soar in the world, we must improve the health standards of the people, especially the health standards of young people. How can we improve our health standards? Naturally, the most important thing is to pay attention to exercise. Not only should we exercise well in physical education classes, but we should also do morning exercises, class break exercises, and extracurricular exercises every day. We cannot go a day without eating, and we cannot go a day without exercising. Exercise does not necessarily require a large sports field and a lot of good sports equipment, and it is not only young students who need to exercise. Playing table tennis, badminton, practicing Tai Chi, and kicking shuttlecock, as well as freehand exercises, are all popular, easy, and healthy exercises. We young students should develop a lifestyle habit of enjoying exercise and exercising regularly every day. This will surely make our physiques transform from weak to strong, and turn the chronically weak and sick "sick man of East Asia" into a brave and fierce "martial man" who is strong and healthy. Secondly, we must pay attention to hygiene. Getting up early, going to bed early, having regular work and rest times, having a fixed amount of food, not eating raw and cold things, not having bad habits, and improving nutrition and developing other kinds of hygienic habits are all ways to strengthen the body, get rid of diseases, and improve health. I hope that all young people across the country will pay attention to exercise and hygiene, and forge our physiques into indestructible bodies, to be strong, brave, and promising nation-building youths.</p>
<p>Enriching Moral Cultivation</p>
<p>Second, to be a nation-building youth, we must have noble morals and personalities. The late American President Roosevelt said it well, "Knowledge without moral cultivation is like giving a new machine gun to a skilled robber." The great British writer George Bernard Shaw also said: "Human behavior in the world is partly enjoyment and partly contribution. If a person's contribution to society is more than their enjoyment, then they can be considered to have a personality. And the quality and quantity of their contribution can exceed the quality and quantity of their enjoyment. The greater the difference in proportion, the more impressive their personality becomes. Conversely, if a person's quality and quantity of enjoyment exceeds their contribution, then they are simply taking advantage of the crowd, and they should be considered to have no personality or a bankrupt personality." Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen also taught us that "the purpose of life is to serve, not to seize." Therefore, to be a nation-building youth, we must cultivate the ability to contribute, serve the people, and strive and sacrifice for the transformation of society, the construction of the country, and the benefit of mankind with noble morals and personalities. In this great era of nation-building, looking at our country and society, there are many robbers who have knowledge but lack moral cultivation. The quality and quantity of what they enjoy often exceeds what they contribute. They aim to seize and not to serve. As a result, the entire country and society is in chaos, and the ignorant masses are in deep water. We, the nation-building youths who are determined to save the country and the people, must reverse their actions, contribute our knowledge and abilities, and even contribute our lives and property, to faithfully serve the construction of a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy new society and new China, and be a "devoted" and "loyal" nation-building youth.

<h3>Mayor's Private Residence Held Meeting Yesterday: Determined Plan to Suppress and Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>Developing Grain Sources and Encouraging Rice Merchants to Freely Procure</p>
<p>In recent days, grain prices have soared, inevitably causing panic among the people. At 2:00 pm yesterday, Mayor Wu invited more than ten people, including Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Office, Fang Zhichao of the Administrative Office, and Yu Shuping, Acting Director of the Police Bureau, to his private residence to review the city's food problems. They all believed that there was no shortage of rice on the market, and that the increase in all goods was the result of panic among the people. In the future, it is decided to (1) request the higher authorities to increase the allocation of grain sources, (2) encourage grain merchants to freely procure, and (3) distribute grain. The Social Affairs Bureau will publish the names and locations of its stores every day so that the people can purchase and the government can supervise, etc. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Three Parties Jointly Handle Rice Distribution</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the mayor decided to convene a meeting with representatives of rice merchants and rice shops in the city again at 8:00 pm tonight at the Municipal Government. At that time, the representatives of the rice shops will request Mayor Wu to order the district offices to handle the purchase and distribution of rice based on household registration certificates, and the rice shops will send shop assistants to assist. Regarding this issue, Mayor Wu stated that rice merchants cannot shirk their responsibility for distributing household rice. The Municipal Government has now issued a document to notify the grain and rice shops and the police sub-bureaus and district offices to jointly handle the matter, and has formulated detailed rules for rice distribution, stipulating the distribution volume and types of rice for each rice shop, etc. The mayor also guaranteed that 10,000 shi of rice will be taken out of the warehouse every day, and efforts will be made to simplify the procedures and there will be no intentional delays. If any rice shops are found not to supply the market, the Municipal Government has ordered the police bureau to investigate strictly.</p>
<p>We Have Ordered Foreign Rice from Switzerland</p>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the Ministry of Food is currently in contact with Switzerland to order a large amount of foreign rice. According to sources from the Central Trust Bureau, our country has ordered a lot of foreign rice overseas. The current problem is how to ship it on time to alleviate the food shortage during this lean season. Regarding the rumor that the foreign rice ordered is all second-class goods, when the reporter inquired with the relevant parties, the reply was: Among the foreign rice purchased, there is no shortage of high-grade rice, but among the Siamese rice, there must be a few percent of Xian rice. In addition, our country is currently negotiating with Argentina to purchase 100,000 tons of wheat. It is said that the negotiations are proceeding very smoothly, but the contract has not yet been signed.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Flour Rationing Price Can Be Decided Within This Week</h3>
<p>Fuxin and other major flour mills in this city have recently requested Mayor Wu to increase the rationing price due to the high cost of raw materials. It is reported that Wu has agreed to adjust the rationing price after the closing of the Field and Grain Conference, so it can be resolved within this week. However, the cost submitted by the industry to Mayor Wu last time was calculated based on a wheat price of 110,000 yuan. The current wheat price has risen to 140,000 yuan, and the cost has also increased. Moreover, the wheat on the market is becoming increasingly depleted. Therefore, the industry will ask the authorities to allocate raw materials for flour milling or supply the market with foreign flour at a fixed price.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Regulatory Committee to Solve Edible Oil Supply</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of edible oil supply in Shanghai, it is reported that the authorities have decided to establish an edible oil regulatory committee, which will be jointly composed of seven units including the Municipal Government, the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Agricultural Bank, the Oil Extraction Industry Association, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the Oil Commercial Association, and vendors. Today, each unit will submit a list of names, and after verification, it is scheduled to be formally established on Wednesday. In order to cooperate with this measure, the Central Trust Bureau has already shipped 6,000 tons of soybeans to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sale of Household Rice Rations; Bureau of Social Affairs Approves Rice Shop List</h3>
<p>To alleviate public panic about insufficient grain, the Bureau of Social Affairs is releasing nine thousand bags of white japonica and Siamese rice daily, totaling over eleven thousand "shi" (a unit of measurement) for the city, distributing them to various rice shops for retail. It is stipulated that citizens must present their household registration certificate when purchasing rationed rice from the shops. The Bureau of Social Affairs also notified the rice shops to register for verification. Currently, the Bureau has approved over six hundred and fifty rice shops. A list of the rice shops and their addresses is published below for citizens to consult when purchasing rationed rice.</p>

<h3>Sericulture Production and Sales Association Passes Silkworm Cocoon Drying and Collection Methods; Loan Applying Silk Factories Handle Registration Procedures</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Sericulture Production and Sales Committee held its first standing committee meeting at the China Sericulture Company yesterday afternoon from 2:00 PM, with Tan Xifu, Xia Jinxiong, Wang Zishuang, Yan Zezi, Chen Junren, Ma Jiping, Wang Botian, Zhou Jiqu, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xixiang, and others attending. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM. The meeting passed all articles of the key points for cooperative silkworm cocoon drying methods and the key points for regional joint silkworm cocoon collection methods.</p>
<p>In addition, the association will handle registration procedures for silk factories applying for loans from yesterday until the 8th. Any silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang that have obtained loans from the National Bank after the victory, and have undergone joint management of silkworm cocoon collection and silk reeling, and have fully repaid the loans before the end of April this year, and have sufficient guarantees, who wish to purchase spring cocoons, can go to the association on the 6th floor, 88 Huqiu Road, this city, to handle registration procedures.</p>
<h3>China Textile Corporation to Handle Yarn Allocation Registration Starting Today</h3>
<p>After the China Textile Corporation raised the allocated price of cotton yarn to 4.6 million yuan per piece last week, the yarn allocation date was also changed to three times a week. It is also scheduled to start handling yarn allocation registration for manufacturers today (the 5th). All manufacturers must obtain a work status form from the survey section of the company, fill it out in detail, and report it truthfully for verification. If the report is false, it will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. The number of newly added or newly started machines will not be allocated yarn for the time being. The yarn will be allocated when the company's cotton yarn production increases.</p>
<h3>Minor Losses to Various Sugar Factories in Taiwan During the February 28 Incident; Taiwan Sugar Corporation General Manager Shen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Shen Zhennan, General Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after completing negotiations in Nanjing regarding fertilizers used by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. According to him, after the February 28 Incident in Taiwan was quelled, he went to various sugar factories throughout the island to inspect them starting on April 7. Company colleagues in various places are generally safe. The loss of public property in various units is also minor.</p>
<p>He said: Taiwan Sugar is the most important industry in Taiwan Province. Twenty thousand employees depend on it for work, and one hundred thousand farmers depend on it for their livelihood. Since the restoration of Taiwan Province, a large part of the factory restoration work has been completed. In addition to the large amount of restoration funds and working capital provided by the Bank of Taiwan, a loan of US$5 million was recently obtained from the Bank of China to purchase hardware materials from foreign countries, so that the plan to complete the restoration of 30 factories by the end of this year can be completed. The area under sugarcane cultivation has reached 90,000 hectares, exceeding the intended target. Therefore, the plan to produce 300,000 tons of sugar next year can be achieved, and it can earn foreign exchange for the country at US$400 per ton exported. However, sugarcane seeds need to be sown in batches from July and August of this year to March of next year. Therefore, to complete this plan, 80,000 tons of fertilizer will be needed this year. Of this, in addition to the 20,000 tons that can be supplied domestically, the remaining 60,000 tons must be obtained from foreign countries, which will cost US$100 per ton, for a total of US$6 million in foreign exchange. However, in the second quarterly quota of imports currently announced, fertilizer accounts for only US$500,000, which must be distributed across the country and will be insufficient.</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that if the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can obtain sufficient fertilizer, simply to complete the plan to produce 400,000 tons of sugar, then in addition to 300,000 tons for domestic consumption, another 100,000 tons will be promoted for export, and the country can earn US$40 million in foreign exchange in one year. The income will be ten times the foreign exchange expenditure when purchasing fertilizer. It is really beneficial to balancing our country's international balance of payments.</p>

<h3>More on "Trachoma"</h3>
<p>— Lu Nanshan</p>
<p>A reader of this newspaper previously inquired whether a mixture of yellow lead oxide and grass carp bile could be used to treat trachoma.</p>
<p>Yellow lead oxide is a lead oxide. Metallic lead is heated to 400 degrees Celsius to become a red powder, also known as red lead or lead oxide. The Shen Nong Ben Cao Lun states that its nature and taste are spicy, slightly cold, and poisonous. Its efficacy and indications are all for surgical use. For ophthalmology, its use is limited to external application. For example, the Jade Dragon Pill and Sou Feng San in the Shen Shi Yao Han are both used with other drugs to apply to the eyelids. Moreover, the texture of yellow lead oxide is rough. Even if it is ground extremely finely, it is still inevitable that there will be residues. Once it is dripped into the eyes, it will inevitably damage the cornea and increase eye diseases. Therefore, any eye doctor's limited drug manufacturing is very fine. It takes years of grinding, refining, and calcining to make it. It is not possible for ordinary patients to coarsely manufacture it themselves to treat trachoma. Be careful. The bitter and cold nature of grass carp bile allows it to treat red eyes and cataracts. Therefore, it is often used in ophthalmology. It can still be effective for mild cases of conjunctivitis in the early stages of trachoma. However, this medicine cannot be used alone and must be refined. For example, the Bear Bile Paste in the Shen Shi Yao Han is made of grass carp bile combined with other medicines. Therefore, this medicine is really one of the auxiliary medicines.</p>
<p>Trachoma is a common and prevalent eye disease. Face cloths and handkerchiefs in public places and other objects that come into contact with the eyes, or working in crowded places with unclean conditions, with dust and sand irritating the eyes, are most likely to spread the infection. In the early stages of this disease, there are often no subjective symptoms. Usually, both eyes are affected. Later, there will be secretions in the morning, itching, and tearing. The patient will feel burning and pain, as if there is ash and sand embedded in the eyes, and the vision will gradually become blurred. The most important thing about this disease is that it is prone to corneal pannus, also known as vascular pannus, and inner skin emergency, which leads to ingrown eyelashes or other dangerous conditions, which can cause partial or complete blindness. Mild cases of trachoma can be cured. If the disease has been around for a long time and is severe, as long as the treatment is appropriate, there is no one who cannot be cured. However, it is necessary to prevent recurrence. Ancient ophthalmology books call this disease "pepper sores" and "drug sores" and have internal medicine prescriptions, such as the Gui Shao Hong Hua San and the Chu Feng Qing Pi Yin in the Shen Shi Yao Han, and the Qing Pi Liang Xue Tang in the Yi Zong Jin Jian. They can be effective for the early stages and inflammation of this disease. Trachoma that has been around for a long time is of no avail; therefore, surgery is used. The way to perform surgery also depends on the severity of the condition. Therefore, those who have not suffered from trachoma must prevent it. Those who have suffered from trachoma must go to an ophthalmologist for a detailed diagnosis and treatment on the spot to be safe.</p>
<h3>Fermented Soybeans</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>(Combined with penicillin and streptomycin)</p>
<p>In China, during the Han Dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing used Zhi Shi Tang, and during the Jin Dynasty, Ge Zhichuan used Cong Shi Tang Sheng Seng San, which all contained fermented soybeans. Fermented soybeans are the remains of green mold parasitized by microorganisms, and contain penicillin. The ancients used them to treat plague and heat, which shows that they knew the wonderful meaning of this early on.</p>
<p>In the field of surgery, there is a kind of onion and fermented soybean cake used to treat carbuncles and large toxins. Applying the onion and fermented soybean cake to the affected area and using ironing and moxibustion methods is similar to the external use of penicillin.</p>
<p>Foreign scientists know that penicillin needs to be refrigerated to avoid heat. Ancient Chinese doctors used it in decoctions, or ironing and moxibustion, and the efficacy was inevitably discounted. This is the difference between refined and crude.</p>
<p>Before penicillin came to China, I often used fermented soybeans to treat various external diseases, and each time I received extraordinary results. Now that penicillin is popular in China, I often encounter cases of carbuncles and cellulitis. After others have used injections of this product without success, I use Yang He Tang to treat them, and the effect is very rapid. - This really has its own strengths, why abandon oneself to follow others?</p>
<h3>Beriberi Attacking the Heart</h3>
<p>— Gong Peiying</p>
<p>The disease of beriberi attacking the heart is caused by toxins in the blood. The so-called attacking the heart means that the toxins invade the heart, causing the heart to be paralyzed and die. Therefore, if you suffer from beriberi, you should seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Otherwise, it is very dangerous to attack the heart, and there are those who cannot be rescued: The newspaper reported in the past: "So-and-so was sick with swollen feet. He called a car on the road to take him home. Suddenly, he had qi reversal and fell to the ground and died." This is because the toxins attacked the heart, and the heart was paralyzed and died immediately. Since beriberi attacking the heart is a symptom caused by blood toxins, the treatment should focus on detoxification therapy. The best detoxification medicines are rhino horn, antelope horn, musk, bezoar, and cinnabar. Appropriate prescriptions include: Qian Jin Xi Jiao Shi Fu Hua Tang, Chi Shui Xuan Zhu Jiao Qi Yi Ren San, Yu Shu Dan, Su He Xiang Wan, Ju Fang Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan, all of which are blood disinfection medicines for beriberi attacking the heart.</p>
<h3>Children's Pneumonia</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>The occurrence of pneumonia is due to the invasion of pneumococcus, which is called acute pneumonia, or primary pneumonia; it is also due to delayed infectious diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, smallpox, and whooping cough, which is called local pneumonia, or secondary pneumonia. Changes in climate and weakening of resistance are the major reasons for the rapid changes in pneumonia patients.</p>
<p>The initial symptoms of this disease are chills, fever, coughing, and vomiting, similar to a cold. Then the fever gets worse, with some reaching 41 degrees Celsius. The pulse is rapid, there is a rattling sound in the phlegm, coughing is frequent, shortness of breath, and nasal flaring, with no nasal discharge or tears. After the fever subsides, the cough loosens, the breathing becomes even, and the disease begins to improve. The period lasts for about a week or more. If the fever lingers and does not subside, and the shortness of breath and nasal flaring continue to increase, then the pulse will become thin and rapid, the face will turn cyanotic, and the patient will fall into a coma and die from exhaustion. If it is caused by delayed treatment of typhoid fever, measles, etc., the fever and cough will persist for a long time without subsiding, gradually leading to difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, nasal flaring, turning into convulsions, and eventually being incurable.</p>
<p>The character "inflammation" has the meaning of heat, so ordinary people think that pneumonia is lung heat, and the pulse is rapid and the body temperature is high, so they prefer to use medicine that is biased towards clearing and cooling. In fact, it is not necessarily so. The condition must be carefully examined and medicine must be used according to the symptoms. Clearing and cooling agents cannot be abandoned, and pungent and warm products such as Fuzi and Guizhi should also be used accordingly. The fever of pneumonia is often caused by cold phlegm obstructing the inside, the lung qi not being able to circulate, and the circulation of the lungs being obstructed. Then the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other wastes in the blood will inevitably increase. The heart initiates a rescue effect, so breathing increases, the pulse is rapid, and the body temperature rises. The treatment should use pungent and warm products such as Ma Huang and Guizhi to stimulate the lung blood vessels, encourage heart function, and cause the sweat glands to open up, so that the virus has a chance to be discharged.</p>
<p>In the early stages of pneumonia, when the muscles are hot and there is no sweat, the cough is not smooth, the breathing is rapid, the tongue coating is white, and the pulse is rapid, Sheng Ma Huang, Bai Jie Zi, Guang Yu Jin, Zhi Ban Xia, Ju Hong, Xing Ren, Zi Wan, Yuan Zhi, Tian Jiang Ke, etc. are used to open up the qi. For severe cases, Ma Huang should be used in large doses. If there is coughing, phlegm, drowsiness, and startle, and there are signs of wind and convulsions, Zhu Dan Xing, Gan Wan Pu, Huo Ci Shi, Sheng Mu Li, and Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan can be added. If the muscle heat is not relieved by sweating, the tongue is moist, the pulse is soft, the patient is tired, and the eyes are exposed, indicating that the heart yang is weak, then Huang Fu Pian, Chuan Gui Zhi, Dan Gan Jiang, Wu Wei Zi, Bai Jie Zi, Zhi Ban Xia, and Ju Hong are used urgently, with the main focus on restoring yang and strengthening the heart. If the disease has occurred several times, the pulse is weak, the limbs are cold, the cough is reversed, and water and drinks are not tolerated, then Huang Fu Pian, Hei Xi Dan, Ci Shi, Long Gu, and Mu Li should be used in large doses.</p>
<p>Pneumonia with a crimson tongue, yellow coating, thirst for drinking, cough, phlegm, rapid breathing, and nasal flaring should be treated with a bias towards clearing and cooling, using Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang as the main prescription. If it is complicated with hot infectious diseases such as measles and typhoid fever, the symptoms of pneumonia should be relieved first to avoid causing unexpected changes. If these infectious diseases have not been cured for a long time and have turned into pneumonia due to delayed treatment, and the heat toxin has not been resolved, Da Xiao Qing Long Tang combined with Jie Du Tang has considerable effect. In pneumonia with rapid breathing and nasal flaring, the chest must be raised, so it is called lung distention in ancient times. Mustard seed powder can be mixed with honey and applied externally. If it is easily blistered, Jin Huang Ru Yi San can be mixed with honeysuckle dew and applied. It has the effect of relieving inflammation and swelling. When used together with internal medicine, the effect is faster.</p>

<h3>Fort Pi-tzu-wo Outside Lushun</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>This newspaper, Shenyang, 24th (Airmail Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pi-tzu-wo quietly stands on the eastern coast of the Liaodong Peninsula. In the past, it was a land of fish and salt within the Japanese "Kwantung Leased Territory." Today, it has a new life, a lookout point and a coastal fortress.</p>
<p>The Lushun naval base警戒 line defined by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is somewhat smaller than the former "Kwantung Leased Territory." Pi-tzu-wo is just outside the line, making it the first important city bordering the area without any political elements.</p>
<p>Ancient Trading Port</p>
<p>Here, the coastline is very long, with numerous harbors. It is a very old trading port. Except for the winter freezing period, ships come and go continuously, reaching Dalian, Yantai to the south, and Andong and various Korean ports to the north.</p>
<p>Closer by are Dagu Mountain, Zhuanghe, and the Changshan Islands, where ship traffic is frequent. Chengzi-tong, the mouth of the Biliu River, Zanzi River, and Liangshui Bay are crowded with fishing boats, dotted with sails, with the seawater gently flowing, creating a majestic scene.</p>
<p>The "Jincheng" railway from Jinzhou to Chengzi-tong, north of Pi-tzu-wo, is the transportation facility that connects this area to Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>Pi-tzu-wo is a militarily important area along the coast of the Liaodong Peninsula. Although it has the disadvantage of vast, shallow beaches that prevent ships from docking, it is compensated by Guanglu Island, Dachangshan Island, and Xiaochangshan Island in the Changshan Islands, all of which can accommodate ships. Haiyang Island is even more like an excellent port. The distance from the coast is only a few nautical miles for closer islands, and no more than fifty nautical miles for those further away, so the shortcomings can be overcome.</p>
<p>Changshan Islands</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of Japan's invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula, we can see that Japan once landed at "Huayuan Kou" and "Yanda Ao" near Pi-tzu-wo, occupied Pi-tzu-wo, and then advanced towards Jinzhou and other places, all of which demonstrate its strategic importance.</p>
<p>We need to use sea, land, and air transportation to take over Dalian. Or, in the future, when our navy displays its power at sea, and warships need to refuel and resupply, being too far from Kent Island, the Changshan Islands off the coast of Pi-tzu-wo are very ideal.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet army has already stationed troops on several large islands in the Changshan Islands, such as Changshan Island and Haiyang Island. According to people's reports, there are also Communist troops there. At the second meeting between the first-line generals of China and the Soviet Union in Pulandian, the Soviet general replied to questions about the Changshan Islands, saying: "That area is within the boundaries of the naval base, and the Soviet Union has a garrison command there."</p>
<p>The Lushun naval base is clearly defined in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, which states that it is "used jointly by China and the Soviet Union," so, of course, the national army can travel to, dock at, and use the Changshan Islands.</p>
<p>Lushun, Dalian, the Changshan Islands... are Chinese territory. During the thirty years of joint use agreed upon by China and the Soviet Union, there is a real need for sincere "friendship" and effective "cooperation."</p>
<p>Fishermen's Paradise</p>
<p>The waters of Pi-tzu-wo, with the vast area formed by the sixteen islands of the Changshan Islands, large and small, are a paradise for fishermen. During the Japanese control, there was a "Toyo Whaling Company Kwantung Prefecture Business Factory." The "Aozi Fish" produced near Zhangzi Island were famous. From the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), the Japanese used diving equipment to engage in fishing, achieving great harvests.</p>
<p>Local fishermen told reporters: "In the past, there were over a thousand fishing boats around Changshan, Guanglu, Haiyang, Zhangzi, and Daxiaohaozi (Rat) Islands, each catching three to four thousand catties of bighead, smooth, and miscellaneous fish daily. Now, there are only sixty-plus fishing boats registered with the fisheries association because, after the restoration, fishing boats were either taken away or destroyed. In addition, local unrest has led to a decrease."</p>
<p>Rich Salt Fields</p>
<p>The sixteen islands have a population of approximately 60,000, most of whom directly or indirectly make a living by fishing. Besides many seafood fish and shrimp, there are also famous products such as "sea cucumber" and "scallops." However, their fishing techniques still follow traditional methods, such as twenty-three pieces of "纲" (Gang) and thirty-five to forty pieces of "挂网" (Gua Wang), which are their only fishing tools. If mass production of salt is desired, improvements must be made.</p>
<p>Pi-tzu-wo's fish terraces are well-known, and its salt production is even more widely renowned. Pi-tzu-wo has all the salt fields and equipment, which are among the best in the country.</p>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, Pi-tzu-wo was assigned to the jurisdiction of Japan's Kwantung Leased Territory. The Japanese then engaged in salt production development. In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu Emperor (1906), the "Man-Han Company" was established to begin building salt fields, later renamed "Japan Jiyo Kabushiki Kaisha," gradually expanding and forcibly buying out civil beaches. The salt fields operated included the "Jiaxinzi," "Donglaotan," and "Biliuhe" three fields.</p>
<p>In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic (1939), the "Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha Pi-tzu-wo Salt Industry Place" also opened fields in Pi-tzu-wo, Songjiatun, and Qingshuihe. As soon as construction was completed, they declared defeat.</p>
<p>In the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), "Japan Jiyo Kabushiki Kaisha" established a "processed salt factory" in Donglaotan. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic (1938), a "Kali factory" was established in Jiaxinzi.</p>
<p>After the August 15th Restoration, the Communist army established a salt affairs agency here, only selling most of the originally stored salt catties and failing to restore public difficulties.</p>
<p>The area and output of the Pi-tzu-wo salt fields, according to statistical figures, are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingshuihe, Songjiatun, Pi-tzu-wo, Jiaxinzi, Donglaotan, Biliuhe, and other six salt fields, a total of 4,939 public strands (陌, mo), with an annual salt production of 4 million dan; 610 privately owned strands, with an annual salt production of 730,000 dan, totaling 5,549 strands of public and private salt fields, with an annual production of 4.73 million dan. One strand is 10,000 square meters, and one dan is calculated as 100 catties.</p>
<p>The "Processed Salt" factory produces one type of washing salt, and the "Kali Factory" produces boiled salt, saltified kali, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfide, high-temperature crystals, low-temperature crystals, brine blocks, and bromine.</p>
<p>The main equipment of the salt fields is that all the water extraction in the fields uses electric motors, transportation is done by light railways, and each field has underground water wells, directly sending the brine to the factory as raw material. A substation and water source are set up in Donglaotan, dedicated to the use of all salt fields and factories. After the Restoration, apart from the Soviets and the Communist army transporting some of the housing, electrical railways, factory machinery, and various equipment, the cluster was repeatedly stolen and moved by the ignorant local people.</p>
<p>The "Jinzhou Salt Field Public Office" took over these salt fields and began planning to resume work, but due to the interruption of the power supply and the destruction of the power poles, wires, and electric motors, most of the salt fields could not be filled with seawater. Under duress, they are handling the addition of wooden waterwheels to replace electricity,勉强开晒(Mianqiang kaisai, barely manage to dry), only accounting for about one-third of the entire salt field, which has been leased out and has begun to work in the fields, and salt can be produced by the end of April. The rest can only be dried after the power supply is restored, and other work cannot be carried out, which is due to artificial deficiencies and insufficient capacity!</p>
<p>The reporter once went to visit the "Jiaxinzi Salt Beach," more than 20 miles away from Pi-tzu-wo, sitting on a light railway pushing away. Looking at the great scene of the salt field, the continuous square salt fields lay there dry and lifeless. The stone houses of the workers, very strong, had no roofs, no doors and windows. The small locomotive was missing parts and could not be started. The power poles had no wires, and everything was out of order.</p>
<p>The situation inside the factory was dismal. The boilers for boiling salt were rusty and corroded, and the machines in the washing plant had no belts. The machines were even more severely damaged by rust, making people unwilling to look any further.</p>
<p>Nearly two years have passed since the liberation of the Northeast, twenty-plus months of time. These machines have been exposed to wind and rain and corroded in the factories without doors and windows. When the Communist army was here, they sold a large portion of the stored salt and took away all the belts and other things, without doing any restoration work.</p>
<p>It has been more than three months since the national army recovered it. The Jinzhou Salt Field Public Office sent people to take over in February of this year. According to the person in charge: "Without electricity or coal, it is difficult to start work. However, the Public Office has formulated a comprehensive resumption plan for all salt affairs in the county. The resumption fee is 2 billion Northeast Circulation Certificates, and resumption may begin sequentially in the near future."</p>
<p>In addition to sadness, everyone feels that if they work hard immediately, there is still endless hope. Otherwise, the salt fields will become even more barren, and the machines will soon become scrap iron.</p>
<h3>Roar, Pi-xiu</h3>
<p>The origin of the name "Pi-tzu-wo" is that there is a mountain head by the sea at the west end of the street, which the locals call Dragon Head Mountain. The mountain has cave nests, and in ancient times, many Pi-xiu (mythical wild animals) lived in them, so it was given this name.</p>
<p>The original administrative division of the area was twenty associations (会, hui), each association having multiple villages (屯, tun). Now, it has been changed to four streets and one hundred villages, including five associations and thirty-two villages on the islands, totaling 24,256 households and 185,650 people. The original 1,700 Japanese residents have already been repatriated.</p>
<p>Pi-tzu-wo is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with a magnificent momentum. The streets are very neat, and the buildings are also very good. The entire area has nearly thirty middle and primary schools, with spacious and magnificent school buildings. Unfortunately, there is no funding. Teachers are not paid, some are indeed "枵腹從公" (Xiaofu cong gong, serving the public on an empty stomach), and students have no textbooks to read, causing them to shed tears in anxiety.</p>
<p>This coastal fortress of the Liaodong Peninsula needs to be strengthened and expanded. The abundance of fish and salt needs to be fully utilized. The education of Pi-tzu-wo, which was recently recovered, can no longer be ignored, otherwise, it will not withstand the onslaught of violent storms.</p>

<h3>High School Student Calls for Suspension of Joint Examination</h3>
<p>Dear Students;</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the law that this year's high school graduation joint examination must be held, our group of senior high school students became extremely panicked and uneasy. The joint examination is related to the fate of our graduating classmates, and we have no choice but to petition the education authorities to postpone the examination.</p>
<p>Eight years of war have dealt a huge blow and devastation to education. In this environment, of course, we cannot learn a complete education. Moreover, during the war, the textbooks used in each school under special evil forces could not be unified. Unable to receive a systematic education, the uneven level is inevitable. How can we forcibly impose a unified examination? The announcement date of the joint examination is too tight. Within this short period of time, we have to review the three-year curriculum from the beginning. Even if we work day and night without rest, forcibly memorizing the review, and are lucky enough to cope with it, this kind of speculative nature is very dangerous, and it is a great harm to the health of the students themselves. Isn't this too far from the essence of Zeng Zi (Confucius' Disciple)?</p>
<p>The Education Bureau mentioned that the joint examination is to improve the level of students, but students study for the sake of passing the examination, for the sake of competing for points and a graduation certificate, and work day and night, exhausting themselves. In fact, they still cannot get a complete understanding. How can this improve the level of students? Therefore, we hope that the Education Bureau will start from the fundamentals as soon as possible. Improving the level of students is not something that can be achieved by a single examination. Now, our education funding only accounts for 3.7 percent. The cost of the joint examination is huge and feels wasteful. Moreover, after the joint examination, there will still be a university entrance examination. The joint examination is really unnecessary. Rather than putting a huge sum of money on a meaningless joint examination, it is better to increase education funding and stabilize the lives of teachers in order to truly improve the standard of education.</p>
<p>Dear students, now we can no longer wait in silence. For our own benefit, we should quickly unite to respond to the demands of Nanjing classmates, and petition the education authorities with a firm and sincere heart, hoping that the education authorities will accept our request to stop the joint examination. (Wuguang Girls' High School)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: At the same time, we received the same appeal from Shanghai Xinzhong High School, so we will not publish it.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that Shanghai is the cultural center of the country and the hub of cultural exchange in the Far East. The dynamics of Shanghai writers not only affect writers across the country, but the Shanghai writers' group is also of concern to both Chinese and foreign observers, and is noticed by writers around the world. This was the case before the war, and it is still the case after the war. However, looking around, writer organizations and the trend of participating in groups were not very prevalent before the war, and are even more lonely after the war. This is certainly because our nationality is not long in organization, and it is also due to the reasons that the writers' group is not interested, less contact, and less compatible. But the reality in front of us is even more undeniable, it is a fragmented and self-governing situation; as a literary writer who is a spiritual technician, it seems that he should first assume the responsibility of spiritual education. In this environment, jointly establish a new writing belief and a new writing style, in order to promote the era and create the era. We also believe that women's art circles should be democratic first and then democratic, and should be unified first and then unified. Therefore, we believe that sectarianism and门户之见 (menhu zhijian, bias and prejudice, literally "the view of the door/family") hinder this goal; we believe that all colleagues who regard literary and artistic undertakings as their career should unite; we believe that there should be not only no conflicts and friction between literary and artistic groups, but they should be complementary to each other, and help each other to stand. Especially in Shanghai, there are so many writers and the gardens are so barren, we hope that sister groups will continue to emerge, and go hand in hand.</p>
<p>To put it a step further, we believe that the same theme of a work, based on the different thoughts and personalities of the writers, will definitely have different reflections and different strokes; this is precisely the characteristic of literature and art, and also the road of literature and art. We should not only recognize this multi-faceted characteristic and broad road, but also cherish it. Therefore, we only ask whether you are loyal to art? Are you loyal to your feelings and experiences? Are you loyal to the freedom of writing? No one needs to ask anyone's religious beliefs or political relationships. They are all good friends and all hope to join this group. We want to ask a question: Why can't a country's limited number of writers be integrated? Therefore, Shanghai's literary and artistic groups not only do not have to build a big door, it is best not to let even the boundaries of nationality exist. Our group not only wants to shake hands with famous writers who have been writing for decades, but also wants to shake hands with young writers who are courageous to work and have unlimited prospects. However, in order to commemorate the May Fourth New Culture Movement, to cooperate in creating new literature and art, and to experiment with the May Fourth spirit of new ideals, we were established in a hurry. However, this is the beginning of work and the beginning of unity. We hope that writers living in Shanghai will participate, and writers from scattered areas will give more guidance, and jointly promote our new ideal for the relationship between literary and artistic writers.</p>
<h3>Literature and Life - Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>I am a person engaged in painting work, with a strong interest in literature and art; although I am very interested in literature and art, I feel a headache every time I write, and Tong Wen often criticizes me for knowing the meaning of "meeting friends with literature and assisting benevolence." Now that the Shanghai Literary Writers Association has been established, I cannot but say a word to live long, so I will talk about "Literature and Life".</p>
<p>What is life? Each person's subjective views on this question are different. Shakespeare believes that life is a drama, and the joys and sorrows constitute a dramatic life. Li Bai regards life as a dream, and expresses his personal fantasies about the universe, creating great poems. Tolstoy, he said: "Life is hard work, not an enjoyment." "Art for life." Life is sometimes like a bunch of beautiful flowers, vivid and fragrant, and sometimes like turbulent waves, ten thousand feet in the sky, broad and magnificent, and indescribable. Or as heavy as Mount Tai, or as light as a feather, what exactly is life? It is difficult to give a precise answer.</p>
<p>The two words "literature and art", when separated, are literature and art, and when combined, they contain the art of literature, or artistic words, the meaning of art is very broad, according to the common saying, "a technique that makes the things of the natural world adapt to the use of human life", but human activities have two different goals, one is need, and the other is appreciation, making pottery with soil, and building houses by craftsmen, are just activities to meet needs, and painters' works and musical performances are activities to meet appreciation. Thus, art is also divided into two types, those made for needs are practical arts, and those created for appreciation are pure arts or fine arts.</p>
<p>All art is symbolic, so Hegel's (Hcgel) argument is that the more material foundations that art relies on, the lower the character, and the less the higher the character, so architecture is the lowest-grade art, and poetry is the highest-grade art, because the medium it relies on is only a symbolic symbol of words, and it can give the reader the whole concept.</p>
<p>Literature, in its broad sense, can include the entire scope of human life and human activities, as well as all known phenomena of nature. It is the greatest source of indirect experience for us, keeping the past world immortal. Through the medium of literature, we can meet ancient philosophers such as Confucius, Qu Yuan, Plato, Aristotle, and meet in a room, without leaving the house, and be able to travel spiritually to the world's famous capitals of Egypt, Babylon, Athens, and Rome, expanding the ideal world in the subject.</p>
<p>The Italian Renaissance movement in the fifteenth century was the cornerstone of modern human civilization, and the first of the New Culture Movement. Our Shanghai Literary Writers Association was established in the Fifth Fourth, which is due to its profound significance and great mission.</p>
<h3>Flower</h3>
<p>— Luo Ming</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Who deeply and sincerely harvests the initial love of girls, and who cultivates the heart field that breeds the hope of spring. Do you know who is the happiest person, drinking the honey of love, looking forward to a bright tomorrow?</p>
<p>Can you imagine a person devoid of emotion? Going to and fro coldly in the lonely human world. Can you imagine an unlucky person? The sorrow of being abandoned outside the door of happiness.</p>
<p>Swimming in the garden pond of emotional life, writing attempted poems, boasting of the years as leisurely as white clouds. You young people, have you ever been delighted to receive the initial blessing?</p>
<p>Beautiful flowers will not bear solid fruits, and it is true that the best ending is often the worst beginning. If you seek the love of young people and can return without breaking the budding hope with thorns, this is the best lyric poem. Naturally, the disillusionment of extravagance is painful. Have you ever been saddened by your bottomless shoes? Even a pair of bottomless shoes should step forward. This may be a lovely story. One day, a pair of slender hands will be busy, and you will get a pair of shoes sewn with your heart, so warm and delicate.</p>
<p>The flowers and leaves are about to be colorful, and the dreams are often deep. Who doesn't write this prelude to youth with a page of poetic feeling?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Is it the eyes of the girl that gave you the deepest affection, or will you never forget this deep pupil?</p>
<p>In me, there is a clear memory: when I showed the scattered pages of my youth, I was once inspired by a pair of eyes. The season of life's maturity: you have the right to enter the garden of March from the childish wilderness. From that time on, I treasured my own life, and I was proud that I had the initial bloom of youth.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten the joy of receiving the blessings from the initial eyes, nor have I dropped the joy of being comforted for the first time. Oh, those long years, I was immersed in delicate longing, like an excellent sculptor, I decorated my own mood. I wanted so far, and after that opportunity of intimacy, I also had the courage to send my overflowing scenery shyly.</p>
<p>If youth is irrigated by love, then my life will never wither and die.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Every young man has his own dreamland. Some are intoxicated by scarlet dreams, some are delighted by golden dreams, some are enthusiastic about purple dreams, and some have cried for dark and desolate dreams.</p>
<p>Dreams are like light clouds on the Aegean Sea, fleeting and light. Now everyone is pursuing that fleeting and light dream.</p>
<p>Some people say: dreams are created by geniuses, then glory will belong to young people with creative genius. If the great Confucians firmly believe that life is always intertwined with selfishness and ridicule, then indulging in this cup of sweet wine of love will never have the best flavor. Therefore, I can't help but feel sad for that vulgar situation, and I hope to find a dark red paradise to create my future. — Although this is still a young man's romantic dream.</p>
<p>I should thank a pure and sincere girl, she guided me into a dream. It was she who told me that the wilderness of friendship can build a love tree in the courtyard, where there is our common paradise. So, on a hazy moonlit night, by the river in the shade of the trees and by the small window with curtains hanging, we walked with love.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's how it started, I felt the value of life, and I also explored the most sincere and noble nature of mankind.</p>
<p>So, I, you, and he, dedicate a talent and maturity to one person, and give all the life's ideals and hopes to him. I am singing for the first bloom of a girl's heart.</p>

<h3>Nocturne</h3>
<p>— Shao Za</p>
<p>Go chase her back</p>
<p>While this quiet spring night</p>
<p>The sky is covered with dreamlike mist</p>
<p>The crescent moon is hazy and the fragrance of flowers is heavy</p>
<p>Go chase her back</p>
<p>While this pipa complains</p>
<p>The spring tide in the distance is rushing</p>
<p>There is a slight voice whispering for a crossing</p>
<p>Go chase her back</p>
<p>While this deserted spring is cold</p>
<p>The nightingale's voice across the mountain is melodious</p>
<p>Under the cold plum forest, a tear is being thrown to the ends of the earth</p>

<p>I am a sailboat drifting at sea,</p>
<p>Let me be the harbor where I anchor;</p>
<p>I am a hardworking gardener</p>

<p>Never sparing my blood and sweat</p>
<p>I am in the middle of the cold winter</p>
<p>The tall pine tree standing in the mountains,</p>
<p>I also hope to include a spring breeze.</p>
<h3>Wells' Prophecy</h3>
<p>— Yang Bao</p>
<p>The late Wells (H. G. Wells) who passed away a few years ago, was a famous writer and prophet. He was once asked: "Sir, in this crazy world, where do you foresee yourself being in ten years?"</p>
<p>"In ten years," he replied, "I will inevitably face one of two fates: either die, or be locked away in a 'non-insane asylum'."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>He Jian was disappointed. He scanned the crowd, seeing that everyone's expressions were normal, with no hint of criticism or resentment. Feeling slightly relieved, he dismissed the staff and asked Shouyi, Li Ming, and the Korean comrade, "What do you think?..."</p>
<p>Everyone remained silent, except for Shouyi, who mumbled, "It's done!"</p>
<p>"I ask you one thing," He Jian said to the staff member, "Today's events can be seen as extremely serious, or as nothing at all; therefore, please keep it a secret, and do not mention a single word to anyone: strictly enforce this regarding everything that happened today!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the staff member did not dare to answer, but stood rigidly at attention, saluting in response.</p>
<p>This interrogation concluded. Regarding its effectiveness, everyone present agreed that the method was a failure, but the goal was achieved. The ultimate goal was to determine whether this staff member was colluding with the paper ball-throwing youth. Now it was clear that the staff member was very frank; his answers showed no signs of deception or concealment of facts, so everyone, especially Li Ming, who proposed the interrogation, was satisfied. This lead was thus dismissed.</p>
<p>Around seven o'clock, Shouyi and the others dispersed. From seven o'clock to nine-thirty was the time agreed upon for exchanging information; from nine-thirty to ten o'clock sharp, the four parties would meet and begin operations. The exchange of information was centered around the International Hotel, and Mr. Zongjian was naturally the host of this center.</p>
<p>"No new discoveries." This was the first phone call received by Mr. Qiejian, made after Zheng Yan returned. "No new discoveries" specifically referred to the fact that before Zheng Yan returned, he had taken a detour through Hongkou to visit the Wansui Hall to see if there were any new developments. At the same time, there was also a hint of hope that Ping would miraculously appear safe and sound. After reporting, Zheng Yan also told He Jian that the on-duty female staff member had finished her shift and taken leave, and would not be returning that night.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, He Jian received a phone call from Ben Ming, informing him that he had dispatched three small teams of sentries to investigate three "dens." Immediately following was a call from the Korean side:</p>
<p>"The eight ounces of chemical raw materials entrusted to us have been analyzed into three different properties, all containing the most potent toxins; now it is confirmed that one of the three toxins, which accounts for twice the amount, has the highest toxicity; this can be determined from the black bottle containing the raw materials. The only point that is not entirely certain is that the number on that bottle is different from the original. However, such numbers can be written at will and cannot be taken as a basis..."</p>
<p>This call was still made by the elderly leader of the Korean side: "eight ounces" remained the code word, and the time of the call was noted. "Raw materials" of course referred to Ping's problem; "toxins" referred to the Japanese background; "three properties" referred to the three "dens".</p>
<p>This phone call explained that their sentries, based on the report of that young comrade, had now determined that Hongzhen was the most suspicious place. "Twice" indicated that the "tickets" in Hongzhen were two people. The colors and style of the car sending the "tickets" were correct, but the number was not the original "10915". At the same time, the old leader further explained that such numbers could be forged or changed at will, and did not seem to be a basis for suspicion.</p>
<h3>The May Fourth Movement and Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement, a memorable day of the New Culture Movement, not only had revolutionary and progressive significance in politics and culture, but was also a day worth celebrating in the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement.</p>
<p>The New Culture Movement spawned by the May Fourth Movement had the significance of "anti-feudal culture," not only implementing a literary revolution, but also positively proposing the slogan of valuing art, drama, and novels! And using the translation and creation of spoken drama as the mainstream of anti-feudal thought!</p>
<p>Hu Shi published a one-act play "Major Life Events" in "New Youth," discussing the issue of freedom of marriage. At the same time, Pan Jiaxun translated Ibsen's "Nora" – "A Doll's House" – which also became a famous work discussing women's issues. Its performance at that time, like a rising storm, formed the rise of the Chinese spoken drama movement! Initially, men dressed as women, but later it was advocated that men and women perform together, and it was believed that student drama had the value of propaganda, education, and artistic research! This correctly and seriously established the new concept of drama from the traditional thinking of "turtle actors and drummers," which is also a valuable record in the history of Chinese drama!</p>
<p>Not only that, but all the theories, performance methods, and techniques of spoken drama were introduced from the West. Due to the "one-stop shop of the People's Art Theater Drama School," the talents trained by "People's Art" eventually expanded the Chinese spoken drama movement!</p>
<p>Thanks to the gift of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the foundation was laid for the Chinese spoken drama movement; until the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the 15th year of the Republic of China, spoken drama was further liberated. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in the 26th year of the Republic of China, spoken drama was affirmed as China's orthodox art, and the spoken drama movement reached its peak! Indeed, the Chinese spoken drama movement was initially related to the Xinhai Revolution, and since then, it has been linked to revolution again and again, and it is indeed a young and progressive art! It is also the mainstream of the New Culture Movement! Therefore, the spoken drama movement is in fact an activity with both cultural and revolutionary significance! And the spoken drama movement must rely on performances, because the special trade of the spoken drama movement is: "No performance, no movement": and because there is "movement," there must be a "direction," so the performance of spoken drama must not lose its working mission, otherwise, blind work and hasty performances will not help the cause, and are close to shooting without a target!</p>
<p>The spoken drama movement has grown by the gift of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, and now, in this post-recovery "May Fourth," all parties are holding special and grand commemorations of this day. Only our spoken drama circles are in a situation of low tide and collapse, but instead, we have disappeared and done nothing, which seems particularly lonely and painful! However, the spoken drama movement of more than 30 years has grown up in hard times, and we must never allow it to decline and disappear in our generation! We must continue to work hard in the spirit of "May Fourth" innovation and progress, to get through the current difficulties, and look forward to the improvement of the situation, and strive for the reappearance of a vigorous atmosphere!</p>
<p>It's time. Friends in the spoken drama circle should unite strongly, strive for theaters and work in many ways, not fear hardship or poverty, work hard for the future of cultural construction in the new China, and dedicate themselves to the gift of the precious "May Fourth" movement to the spoken drama movement!</p>

<h3>Random Talk While Moored</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Being sick and seeking medical treatment seems to have become a person's condition. However, this tendency, when viewed in terms of its significance to all mankind, is too unfortunate and too terrible.</p>
<p>Ma Zi hates seeing mathematicians, because mathematicians must write zero as "〇". And the existence of this image seems to be deliberately embarrassing Ma Zi. In fact, mathematicians are absolutely unaware of these things.</p>
<p>What I am talking about is naturally certain Ma Zis.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Liu Chengyu in modern times, who opens and closes his mouth calling himself Liu Ma Zi, and talks about Jingting Liu Ma Zi whenever he sees people; quick-witted and quick-spoken, Ma Zi is not something to criticize, but instead becomes his beauty.</p>
<p>If you make friends with a clerk in a clothing company, he pays special attention to your clothes. If you make friends with an artist, he will pay special attention to your contours, and if you make friends with a barber, he has to pay attention to your hair.</p>
<p>I think if you don't have a very strong neck, I advise you to make fewer friends with porters.</p>
<p>I hate the "harboring dirt and filth" of human nature.</p>
<p>In order to make walking time easier, I think I should save less of the "noble" and "solemn" giant belly.</p>
<p>However, the meaning of this is quite different from being on the stage.</p>
<p>There are two idiomatic myths in China. One says, "The Chen lineage is a thousand years old, and Peng Zu has lived for eight hundred years."</p>
<p>Based on this myth, there is the following story:</p>
<p>"When Peng Zu was born, Chen Bo leaned on his pillow and slept. When Chen Bo woke up and asked the servant, the servant checked the running account left by his great-grandfather and said: "Peng Zu died two hundred years ago." Chen Bo rubbed his eyes, yawned leisurely, and sighed sadly: "I knew this child wouldn't grow up."</p>
<p>This is naturally a joke, (laugh or not? Readers are free to choose.)</p>
<p>However, when I think of myself and many upward and kind friends, I have never dared to think of comparing myself with Peng Zu. However, looking in the mirror and examining myself, I don't necessarily have a "death face" that will definitely die young. I hope that the elders who control our destiny will not sleep for a thousand years like Chen Bo.</p>

<h3>The American Candy Bill</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>It is said that in the first ten months of 1946, Americans spent as much as 520 million US dollars on candy. When this news reached the ears of a representative of a small country in the United Nations, he complained a lot, saying:</p>
<p>"If our country could use this candy bill as the country's annual economy, we could make our country a paradise within ten years."</p>
<p>This "old news" on the one hand reveals the wealth of big countries, and on the other hand ridicules the "smallness" of small countries.</p>
<p>However, in our opinion, there is no ridicule at all. The American candy bill for ten months is 520 million US dollars, and what we expect from the American loan to China is only 500 million US dollars. The US dollar bonds recently issued by the government are not even this amount.</p>
<p>Some things cannot be thought about deeply, because once you think about them deeply, you will often feel embarrassed. We certainly cannot shout to Uncle Sam: "If you are less sweet on your mouth, we will be less bitter in our hearts." But comparing the wealth, strength, health, poverty, and desolation between the two, what else can we, the descendants of Yan and Huang, say? Who among us can not be stunned in the face of the American candy consumption figures?</p>
<p>It seems that the complaints of a representative of a certain small country are not only his personal. President Roosevelt said it well:</p>
<p>"When some people eat too much and others eat too little, there is a social problem, and even an international problem."</p>
<p>During the war, the United States became the arsenal of the United Nations. After the war, the United States took on the task of post-war relief. All of this only shows that Americans also have foresight. They know that it is impossible to be detached, it is impossible to move the United States away from the earth, and it is impossible for every American to rise by pulling their hair. Since they live on the earth, they have to take some responsibility for this chaotic and disturbing world. We still remember that last year, President Truman appealed to Americans to save food in order to save the world's food shortage. Truman's speech was roughly what Roosevelt had said before.</p>
<p>The end of the war is almost two years ago, but the world is still restless. There are really not many countries that can restore the stable and healthy living standards of the pre-war period. Just look at the number of sugar consumption published by the US authorities this time, and you will see how many small and weak countries' representatives have been affected and how many people's complaints have been caused! Even in the British Empire, the people there are a little envious and jealous of the American candy bill. Due to the rationing system that is still in effect, most British people have to envy the British girls who married American soldiers.</p>
<p>An American candy bill, in addition to its practical value, unexpectedly has such a side effect: it reflects how shabby the real world is!</p>
<h3>On Poetry Clocks</h3>
<p>— Chaoyang</p>
<p>People in Fujian like to make poetry clocks, called knocking clocks, which is like accelerating the completion of poetry, beautifully named striking bowls. Its format is very complicated, just like riddles with various formats. Embedding characters, collecting sentences, and chanting separately are the most common. The patterns of embedding characters are like the first two characters, called side by side, the last two characters are called parallel lotus, the third character is the wasp waist, and the fifth character is the crane vine. I think the chanting style is the most generous, and it is even better if it can collect sentences. Mr. Yi Kuan is a master in this field, such as chanting separately in Penglai Pavilion, which is also made by collecting sentences. It is "Among them, there are many fairies fishing, and the heroes in the world are only the rulers."</p>
<p>My friend Xu Jizhuan's father has a couplet that chants separately on Han Xin and the character Zi: "How can he willingly endure humiliation under his crotch, and from then on there is nothing left in his eyes." This is similar to the format of the above couplet, although it is not collecting sentences, the character Zi is empty and broad, and it is very difficult to be appropriate. It uses the allusion of no one else in his eyes, and uses several empty words to move it, which is like five sparrows and six swallows, and every penny is equivalent, which is a good work. Therefore, at that time, everyone present put down their pens for it. This is the same as Chen Tao's couplet in the old sun, embedding characters side by side: "How can the road not be far away at sunset, and how can the middle be dry but the outside is still strong." The same use of empty words, the skills are also the same, the first sentence is about his own situation, the far road refers to Changchun, the second sentence satirizes current affairs, or potential, and Chen is drifting away from Ming, and villains harm gentlemen, often benefiting them.</p>

<h3>New Uses for Static Electricity</h3>
<p>Static electricity, such as the electricity that makes the ends of hair stand up when combing, is now being used in the food industry for the dry separation of particles.</p>
<p>This method can separate the meat of shelled nuts from their shells. Remove raisins from leaf stems, etc., remove cabbage seeds from grains, and separate harmful seeds from various useful seeds.</p>
<p>A new advance is to pre-treat the surface of the separated minerals so that their particles are easily pulled apart in the electrostatic field. Acid gases, such as hydrofluoric acid gas, are known to be effective in treating silicate minerals. Feldspar and quartz can be separated by this method. Hydrofluoric acid forms potassium and aluminum fluorides on feldspar particles, but quartz particles are only etched by this treatment, and gaseous tetrafluoride escapes.</p>
<p>As for separating minerals such as limestone, dolomite, magnesite, and borax, acetic acid and benzoic acid dicarboxylic acid vapor can be used as pre-treatment materials.</p>
<h3>Preventing Focus of Aircraft Windows in the Stratosphere</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Although stratospheric flight has not yet been commercially implemented, the American optical industry has already prepared glass that absorbs invisible ultraviolet rays to make aircraft windows. This is because at an altitude of more than fifteen miles, ultraviolet rays can focus human skin in two or three minutes, or even injure human lives. On the ground, we are not subjected to these light rays because the extremely short wavelengths they contain have been filtered out by ozone in the atmosphere. There is a kind of glass that does not allow ultraviolet rays to pass through, but only allows infrared heat to pass through, and makes the heat not escape after entering. There is another kind of glass that can absorb both ultraviolet and infrared rays, thus rejecting the heat rays together. On a stratospheric aircraft, equipped with sliding windows made of these two types of glass, drivers can use them to defend against invisible rays and control the temperature inside the aircraft.</p>
<h3>MGM's New Film "A Foreign Romance" Three Leads</h3>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck"</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>During the Soviet-German War, Soviet women on the front lines suffered hardships and dangers. In order to defend the freedom and land of their motherland, and in order not to let those Nazi thugs madly slaughter mankind, the wonderful ones bravely stepped onto the battlefield, and they selflessly contributed their entire lives. The heroine Natasha in "Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck" is one of the millions of Soviet women.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the film, when German paratroopers landed near Leningrad, the Soviet women in the collective farm unhesitatingly took up weapons to meet the brutal enemy. Then, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, and the horn to defend the motherland sounded. Countless women joined the ambulance team and went to the front line. They and the Red Army soldiers went to the front line together, lived and died together, fought with the Nazi thugs, reversed the fate of history, and completed the responsibilities of the children of the era.</p>
<p>But these girls also have rich feelings. When they parted with their lovers and fiancés at the station, they were tearful and reluctant to leave. But when they thought of the more important tasks in front of them, they would embark on the journey without hesitation. Here, the affairs of children's love are critically reduced to the second place, and only love for the motherland is cherished by everyone. Such personality and spirit can never be destroyed by Hitler or any force. The Soviet Union's ability to defeat the German bandits has its inevitable conditions.</p>
<p>Having become accustomed to the style of Hollywood movies, Soviet movies have a different style. "Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck" grabs you tightly from the beginning. The director's handling of the scene of the German army landing, as well as Natasha's killing of the German sentry later, is exceptionally clean and neat. At the end, the Soviet army rushed towards the enemy in spite of the gunfire, and the women's ambulance team went to the front line together, which fully showed the director's majestic spirit. But in the delicate places, like after Natasha had a dispute with another female nurse, she rushed to the lieutenant to resolve the misunderstanding, and the military doctor instructed the lieutenant not to be stimulated. After hearing this, Natasha stood aside blankly, considering how to deal with the current problem. That was the best scene handled by the director in the whole play.</p>
<p>Feidelova, who plays the heroine Natasha, is a Soviet meritorious actor and has achieved high achievements in this film. The emotional changes in each scene are explained very clearly and delicately. In the entire film, every actor's pluck is simple and solid, and perhaps this is the characteristic of Soviet actors.</p>
<h3>"Eight Deaths and One Life"</h3>
<p>— Mingtao</p>
<p>"Nine deaths and one life" is an old idiom, and it is often used to describe a person's difficulty in escaping from death. Of course, the ratio of "nine" to "one" is not as accurate as the numbers in arithmetic, but when considering actual life, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>With nine opportunities of death juxtaposed, leaving only a glimmer of life; in other words, the possibility of death has far exceeded or is close to inevitable, and the possibility of survival is unless you encounter a miraculous chance. There is such a person, (let's just call him a hero.) He can confidently pass through the heavy encirclement of death, and kill his way out of the extremely difficult battle formation, winning in the "all-in" gamble. Then, the surrounding audience and listeners summed up this epic and tearful story of the "hero" with the four words "nine deaths and one life" to describe and praise.</p>
<p>Story - Gu Ying, the magistrate of Shangcheng County, Henan, committed a total of 82 crimes, including</p>
<p>There were as many as eight counts of capital crimes, but he was never shot. I don't think this is a piece of news that "if the investigation does not match the facts, please correct it." Since the truth of the news is beyond doubt, what I am scolding is the reason that allows him to live with "eight deaths and one life."</p>
<p>Someone once said that a coward dies a hundred times, and a hero dies once, because the latter is stronger and knows how to choose the opportunity to die. Now is the time when flies die once and tigers die a hundred times. Not to mention the seven or eight times of "death" written on white paper, it won't be able to do anything to him, even if it is a hundred or a thousand times, it will be in vain, because he has the magical ability to escape.</p>
<p>The facts should be corrected, so I suggest changing "nine deaths and one life" to "eight deaths and one life," which seems to be more realistic.</p>
<h3>Record of a Dangerous City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Old Zhu watched him send the wealthy lady out the door, hoping that he would come back immediately, but after waiting for four or five minutes, he was nowhere to be seen; he knew that he could not be polite today, and hurriedly used extremely fast steps to chase out to look for him. Sure enough, in the courtyard inside the second door, he found Director Xiong hurrying to walk out.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xiong! I'm sorry, I've come to visit you seven times!" He caught up with him and said loudly in a very serious tone: "The batch of military vehicles that are going to Liuzhou tomorrow that I mentioned was told to me personally by Director Ma's secretary! Mr. Xiong, if you can allow us to ride along, we would be very grateful. If there are really difficulties and you can't agree to us, then please refuse immediately! This is an official matter, and I would never dare to force you! Especially since I, surnamed Zhu, have never had any friendship with you, so I can't force you to do things that are illegal like that Mrs. Pan did just now! However, I can't wait any longer! Please just say one sentence, and I will leave immediately! I will write down everything I have seen and heard here in the past three days and let the society judge! Is it that the lives of the thirty or forty poor actors who are still staying in Guilin to perform for the army today are not as important as the goods hoarded by the wives of several bank employees and movie actresses..."</p>
<p>This set of words, which was like a complaint and a scolding, caught Director Xiong off guard.</p>
<p>"I didn't say I couldn't do it!" He denied it anxiously.</p>
<p>"But you didn't say you could either!" Old Zhu took another step.</p>
<p>Now, the young Director Xiong realized that although the literary and art circles in China have never played any role in politics, the general public is most sympathetic to them, so they also have a kind of power that he should pay attention to.</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! I will definitely help you with your matter. Those vehicles tomorrow will definitely take all of you away together!" He said very readily.</p>
<p>With the first cannon firing, Old Zhu was also a little overjoyed.</p>
<p>"In that case, on behalf of the troupe, I thank Director Xiong!" A smile appeared on his face again.</p>
<p>"It's nothing! It's nothing!"</p>
<p>"But when should we get on the bus?"</p>
<p>"In the afternoon, you can find Section Chief Yu from our section one. He will tell you what to do." At this time, Director Xiong's attitude was really very sincere, with no signs of shirking or delaying.</p>
<p>Old Zhu thought that there would be no more problems, so he happily bid him farewell. (63)</p>
