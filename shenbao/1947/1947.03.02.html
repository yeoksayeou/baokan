<h3>宋子文辭職已照准　主席暫兼行政院長　張嘉璈任中央銀行總裁</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國防最高委員會，一日下午四時假國府會議室舉行臨時會議，蔣主席親自主持，出席曁列席者三十餘人，當經通過：（一）行政院院長宋子文辭職照准，（二）行政院院長職務，由國民政府主席蔣中正暫行兼理，五時許散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕主席兼理政院訊傳出後，各方觀感均佳，認為過去若干之困難，今後均可迎刃而解。據政府方面權威人士稱：主席兼理政院乃示政府決心改組，目前為一過渡時期，主席目榮政院，即望早日進入改組階段而目前先行擴充機構，成立政會諸舉，乃改組政府之初步工作，繼之即可着手政院與國府之改組。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國府一日令：（一）中央銀行總裁貝祖詒呈請辭職，准免本職。（二）中央銀行副總裁張嘉璈另有任用，應免本職，（三）特任張嘉激為中央銀行總裁。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕張嘉璈一日接見記者時，對目前金融情形拒絕發表意見，僅對東北工礦情形有所聲述。據悉：張氏日內將赴滬一行。對形拒表，東北</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕據高級政府方面稱：行政院副院長翁文灝及其他各部畏將繼續担任各職。政治觀察預料，川主席張羣將出長行政院。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕宋子文一日於立院答覆各立委詢問時，對渠過去所施各種政策，拒絕有所答辯，惟否認某報所稱渠過去所行各種政策盡屬買辦行徑之指斥，宋氏以徉帶嘰笑之口吻稱：余過去所行之關稅自主政策，廢除不平等條約政策，是否亦可稱為買辦政策之行徑耶？氏在會中並不韙政策之失敗，然謂此四月前時局有以使之，不能完全歸過於渠人。渠謂，對於國家，此心可質天日，不欲盡求他人諒解。宋氏今日答，情至為動但對各立委質詢多淡然處之，然其一言動，處處其內心之眞性。迨退會登車時，步艱遲，由左右扶登車廂，面部疲備之態，一若大病初愈。</p>
<h3>宋院長在立院　報告財政情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕立法院一日晨臨時會議時，宋院長列席報告財政經濟情形，原詞如次：</p>
<p>本人在上星期貴院例會，本來打算來列席報告，因為二月十六日國防會通過了經濟緊急措施方案，十七日即須實施，本人必須赴滬督促一切實施辦法，因此，與孫院長商定，在今天來報告，實在很覺抱歉。</p>
<h3>請辭行政院長　先後共有三次</h3>
<p>今日可以奉告，本人在去年已經向主席請辭行政院長的職務，先後三次，到現在己蒙主席允准了，但仍樂於借此機會向諸位報告一切。</p>
<p>現在社會一般人士，對當前經濟危機發生的緣由，表示疑問，他們明瞭現在的局勢，由於共產黨的軍事行動，而日見惡化，但是他們不能了解的，是我們過去，未嘗沒有內戰，可是從來沒有像目前遭遇的危機一樣的嚴重。</p>
<p>本人覺得，這個問題的確值得研究，同時，本人以為，解決這個疑問，應該抓住這問題的中心來檢討。現在略略的叙述以前財政的經過。</p>
<p>當民國十一年時，本人奉國父任命為廣州中央銀行行長的時候，有兩家銀行停業了，這兩家銀行就是龍濟光執掌政權時的中國銀行廣州分行，因凖備金被他刦奪，和陳炯明時代的廣東省行濫發紙幣，所以當時人民對於銀票，簡直毫無信心。</p>
<p>國父看到這個情形，知道對於金融財政，非穩紮穩打不可，因此他吩咐，除非有切實的準備，不准發行一張紙幣，本人至今，牢記未忘。自廣東內部叛亂作戰起，以至國父逝世後北伐為止，雖以廣東一省應付整個軍閥軍隊的戰爭，軍事財政極度困難的時候，中央銀行同人，對於國父的訓令始終未敢忘懷，雖然各方壓力重重，財政艱危萬分，但中央銀行並不因此發行一張不可靠的紙幣。</p>
<p>這樣的措施，收到了什麼效果呢，中央銀行鈔票，從未打些微折扣，並且有很長時期，鈔票的價值，超過現銀的價值，所以雖然戰事連綿，革命政府的金融經濟制度，始終健全充實。國父之深謀遠慮，終能實現。</p>
<p>在國民政府定都南京，並繼續統一國內時，華北。華中各地的發行鈔票的銀行，還是很多，他們是把銀幣作發行準備的，所以各有各的準備，有些倒閉，有些都能存在，但各銀行多少能自行管制，因為濫發紙幣，便發生擠兌的後果，因為有了此種自然的的束，所以沒有一個地方政府或獨立軍隊能够忽略其發行的安全程度，即使偶有銀行倒閉的事件，其影響亦祗限於當地。中止通貨膨脹必須先獲和平</p>
<h3>中止通貨膨脹必須先獲和平</h3>
<p>民國廿四年，美國實施白銀政策，白銀價格，因之高漲。同時，我國白銀出口，亦為數激增，國內經濟局勢非常嚴重，政府為解除危機起見，於是廢止銀本位，改用法幣政策，這個時候，白銀遝往國外出賣，而以外匯基金為準備本位，本人記得很淸楚，英國財政部的李滋羅斯爵士，當　是實施政策的顧問，他曾說過，法幣制度無疑的是可採用制度中最好的一個，但政府必須能够自加的束，因為自紙幣兌現取銷之後，對於通貨膨脹的自然限制，也已經同時消失了，許多年來，這個忠告，本人永遠不忘。</p>
<p>法幣制度開始推行，非常順利，由於外匯穩定，對外貿易逐年好響，一直到民國廿六年抗戰開始的時候，如果不是使用法幣制度，恐怕國家難以支持八年長期的抗戰，這點想為大衆所承認。</p>
<p>但在同時，挽救中國戰時財政的法幣制度，却孕伏着今日國家禍害的根源，常國府支出超過收入的時候，惟一的辦法，乃是靠　　機來彌補，這就發生了最大的害處，因為有所倚賴而不知撙節，各方以為多發一點鈔票有何關係，為何不予取予求。這樣一來，於是通貨日趨膨脹，物價日就高騰，直到戰事結束的時候。</p>
<p>戰事一經結束，如果國內能獲得和平，通貨自然也可停止膨脹，因為軍費可以節减，稅收可以增加，同時像敵產和黃金的出售，也可增加國家額外的收入，鈔票自可不再添發，而物價也可以穩定下來了。</p>
<h3>共黨啓釁目標破壞經濟制度</h3>
<p>可是，事實的演變，皆出於意料之外，由於共黨的啓　，國家重復捲入戰禍，不但和平建設無從獲得，破壞且比抗戰時期更為劇烈，敵人所造成的破壞還大都是因戰事而造成的，但是共黨都是蓄意的，放縱的，他們的目標，是要破壞整個的經濟制度，要使政府崩潰，以便趁機奪取政權，因此，拆毀鐵路，炸毀廠房，破壞鑛塲，同時在侵佔的地區自立政權，開辦銀行，並且發行他們的紙幣，人民久已渴望和平，現在非但不能受到和平的實惠，反而再度墮入比較抗日消耗更為嚴重的戰爭，政府收入，旣不能如願增加，但是搶修交通及鑛廠等等費用，與日俱增，無從抑制。</p>
<p>剛才所說各方面關於目前經濟情形的疑問，此即是一個根本的答覆，從前一切國內的戰事，比較現在所目睹的戰事，誠為藐乎其小。以前戰事是兩個軍隊的爭鬥，並不知共產黨蓄意作一切交通及生產的破壞，亦不如共產黨存心推翻現行的社會制度，而且更重要的一點，當時紙幣發行的增加，有其自然的限制，但是自從法幣政策推行之後，此種限制，已經不復存在，於是通貨繼續膨脹，投機成為普遍化，利率隨之飛升，一切經濟上之病態，凡各位今日所欲提出詢問者，亦隨以俱至。從前本人在財政部的時候，從消極方面，對於國庫負有忠實看守之任務。凡一切不必要的支出，必斷然予以拒絕。現在雖改任行政院的職務，因事實上關係，不幸對於各方面不斷的要求增加用途，仍然是阻遏的要衝，前後相較，如出一轍。</p>
<p>現今抗戰已成過去，在經過長期痛苦之後，都希望得到精神上及物質上的寬弛安慰。此種心理，極可同情，但無情之事實俱在，不容忽視。當財政部無法籌得的款，每一件巨額支出，需要支付，即對我本人成為一次堅強的爭執。因此，為籌措新的收人來源，乃着眼於加強處理敵偽產業及興辦中國紡織建設公司等事業。在接收敵偽產業處理的時候，確曾發生各方面越軌的行動，但是行政院敵偽產業處理機關成立以後，接收的秩序，逐漸恢復。嗣後經過參政會監察院等聯合清查團之清查，所有弊端之發現，與敵偽產業處理機關之負責人，全然無關。此可差為引慰！至於中紡公司之成立，當時羣起指摘，多主張福應將敵有紗廠出賣。如果照此實行，事實上等於犧牲國家全體之利益，以平添少數暴富的人。國庫之所得，不過二三千億，而去年中紡公司的盈餘，即達四千億餘元。今年或可以得到盈餘一萬億元。假使實施輕工業歸民營之政策，現時將中紡公司估價變賣，其資產儘可售得三萬至四萬億元。是中紡公司之組設，尚無錯誤之可言。</p>
<h3>外匯供給問題尤須全力應付</h3>
<p>現在國內通貨膨脹情形，固已可慮，而因對外貿易引起之外匯供給問題，尤須全力應付。輸出必須增加，僑匯必須控制，非此不能補充外匯。國內通貨與國外存款兩事，實相密切關連。通貨情形惡化，則外匯更難取得。外匯不予補充，則國內幣值與物價所受之影響，尤為深刻。此種梧互產生之因果，最值得吾人之注意。</p>
<p>政府對於收入方面極為有限，但為應付各方開支要求起見，不能不仰仗於增加發行。本人深悉此種途徑，足以引起可能之嚴重局勢，因此本人和同僚們，日夜為這個問題担心，但是各方面總以為本人是在一味拂他們的意志。如此忍受各方的責備，幾乎祗可認為命運所支配。</p>
<p>直到今天，本人仍堅決反對國庫支出不必要的增加，因此本人已經好像是公衆的仇敵。每當物價暴漲，本人即被人唾罵，當本人鑒於費用過於龐大，要求重加考慮的時候，報紙上即有文章，說是別人都已贊成，獨有行政院長加以阻碍。</p>
<p>當前的經濟危機，是由於八年抗戰和繼續應付共產黨攻擊，以致國庫不能平衡所累積的結果，同時上海的投機買賣，更加深嚴重的局勢。</p>
<p>現在政府採取嚴厲的經濟緊急措施，一方面取締投機買賣，一方面竭力設法恢復收支平衡的趨勢，以使通貨停止膨脹，如果對該項措施有任何疑問，行政院各有關部長和本人、均極願解釋答復。</p>
<p>關於取褅投機的迅速措施，是有裨實際，並且切實有效的。我們需要這種急迫的措施，是為了要使其他長期措施能夠生效的緣故，祇有在長期措施方面，方可尋覓基本解救的方法。</p>
<p>總括言之，緊急措施，即設法將任何非屬必要或可暫緩使用的費用停付，以使收支趨於平衡。同時如郵電等公用事業，應該自給自足。稅課應積極增收，即如所得稅一項，據財政部報告，以後數月內，可望有八千億元的收入，中紡公司等敵產，應加緊出讓，剩餘物資，應迅速處理。</p>
<h3>銀樓業請原團　績向政府呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕銀樓業請願團，一日績向監院國防會請願，要求撤消限期登記，出售暨限令兌換國幣之規定；准許經營收兌加工暨出售金飾業務並准同業向央行申請配售原金，藉供需要。彼等又稱，以官定價格交易，有出無進，全國銀樓存金，可於一日售罄，則全國數百萬從業人員，即將從此失業。故決堅持上述要注，並在京設聯絡處，必要時將再度請願。</p>
<h3>國際復興銀行即派代表來華　助我國解決通貨問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿八日電〕華爾街金融日報頃載稱，國際復興銀行，業已要求美國出席該行代表柯拉多前往中國，協助該國解決通貨膨脹問題。一俟國際復與銀行正式任命新總裁之後，柯拉多即將啓程前往中國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕前陸軍部助理部長麥克洛埃，頃正式膺選世界銀行總裁職，將於三月十七日繼去年辭職之梅耶爾，接管世界復興經費八十億美元之業務。</p>
<h3>各黨派立監委國府正式任命　參政員增加名額發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國府一日令：（一）任命趙允義，傅巖，王俊，康澤，安轉廷，施逸生，李文齋，白鳳兆，倪烱聲，吳聞天，徐公遂，滕傑，周伯敏，羅貢華，陳玉科，苑實璜，劉廣瑛（以上國黨），劉東嚴，張伯倫，丁廷標，劉鵬九，王師曾，夏濤聲，夏爾康，穆子斌，周蜀雲，陳祖貽，靑城烈，史澤之，傳繼良（以上靑年黨），張映南，鍾介民，伍藻池，黃伯英，王世憲，郭光麟，郭虞裳，孫渠，崔心一，侯北人，潘　梅，羅靜軒（以上民社黨），芮逸夫，傅堅白，劉家駒，劉友深，連天祥，藍文徽，黃國書，張懷（以上社會賢達），為立法院立法委員，此令。（二）任命曹造森，陳景川，羅霞大，麻傾翁，王宜，李煦，王含章，伍如恭格，張祿（以上國民黨），李不韙，楊永浚，寇慰祖，黎澍，郭叔皋，魯廷奎（以上靑年黨），黃任實，盧毅安，李啓輝，陳伯淸，金龍章，李肇統，羅孝高（以上民社黨），向乃祺，楊酒儒，馬國義（以上社會賢達），為監察院監察委員，此令。（三）國民參政會第四屆參政員，依照修正國民參政會組織條例第三條丁項，應行增加之名額，業經分別遴定，茲將其名單公布之，此令。（四）國民參政會第四屆參政員增額名單：張善與，黃淵偉，馮雲仙，王雋英，凌子惟，宋宜山，徐警予，王冬珍，葛武棨，方少雲，侯天民（以上國民黨），張子柱，林可璣，魏時珍，段慎修，邱椿，姜蘊剛滋，楊漢揚，萬鴻圖，汪祟屏，黃蔭萊，陳璇珍，劉中一，魏際青（以上民社黨），艾時，王澤民，溫良儒，孔德成，鄒樹文，傅儒，潘朝英，張　真，孫繩武，謝娥，喬嘉甫（以上社會賢達）。（四）國民參政會第國參政員四川省及青島市缺額，業經依照修正國民參政會組織條例之規定補行選定、茲將其名單公布之，此令。（六）補選國民參政會第四屆參政員名單：四川省向王寗萸，謝明霄，靑島市侯聖麟。（七）國民參政符第四屆參政員馬愚忱，已改任遼寗省臨時參議會議長，所遺參政員一職，業經依法遴選補充，茲將其名單公布之，此令。（八）遞補國民參政會第四屆參政員名單：遼寗省王化一。</p>
<h3>措施切實執行危機可能挽救</h3>
<p>假使道些措施，都能切實執行，本人相信危機可能挽救。在民國廿一年，商軍攻擊淞滬之後，各項稅收，突然銳减，當時政府曾採取斷然的措施，以使收支平衡，這由於在那個時候，大家一致認為即使暴敵當前，最首要的工作，還是在設法避免經濟的破產。那年的收支，終於達到了平衡。</p>
<p>當我們一方竭力節减費用的時候，我們還須同時不惜任何代價，發展生產，所以前天四聯總處理事會上，主席指示無論如何困難，農貸的數額，必須予以增加。</p>
<p>此外還須提起一件事。戰前我國棉花產量，足堪自給，因為對敵人對共黨的戰事關係。棉田被毀的結果，本年不能不向美國購入價值一億七千五百萬美元的棉花，來供給國民衣着的需要。現在大量美棉種子，已經獲得，技術人員亦經延攬，農貸已經準備，我們在明年，即可能將所產棉花足供四分之三的需要，而在本年，國內所產，祗可供給四分之一的需要。我國地大物博，民俗勤勞，祗要大家肯決心力行，目前的困難，是不難消除的。</p>
<p>在經濟危機之下，自須有不辭勞怨之人，苟使於事有濟，則亦不惜為衆矢之的，本人以前為遏止通貨膨脹而所為之舉動，純粹以責任為出發點，明知是一件決不能討好的事，但也原無討好的意思。</p>
<p>本人也是一個普通的人，自然亦不會毫無過失，所謂人非聖賢，孰能無過。所以本人決不敢說所做的每件事，都是確當而有效的，不過都是為一個共同的眞實的目標，絕對無私人利益的打算</p>
<p>此次克服經濟危機，能否成就，全視通國上下長吾能一致毅力，擁護政府經濟緊急措施，除非舉國人民，俱能切實了解當前局勢的嚴重，並能摒棄私人的成見，而以國家利益為前提，恐無論任何一人或任何一個團體，能以達成救國之目的。</p>
<p>本人願再重述主席最近重要的提示，說「現在我國經濟狀况已屆非常嚴重之時」。此次經濟緊急措施方案的實施，自不免使我同胞感受靈大的痛苦，但除非我們能有堅定之信心與強有力的行動，則難免中共產黨的計謀。以上僅就與財政經濟有關問題簡單報告，諸位先生有何詢問，請儘量發表，當由本人及各主管分別奉答。</p>

<h3>中共南京聯絡處　要求延長撤退期　上海辦事處受嚴密保護</h3>

<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕中共發言人王炳南今日向聯合社記者稱，中共代表團已請中·美兩國軟府，將中共三月五日前退出政府區械之限期，延長十五日，以便京滬渝三地中共人員一百七十名，作適當部署後撤退延安。惟聞美國方面不致同意。此一限期，係於一個月前規定，在此期間，由美方負責遺送政府區域內中共人員返延。</p>

<h3>金鈔政策的得失　貝祖詒在立院臨時會報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕貝祖詒一日午於立院檢討央行一年來執行金鈔政策得失時，認此一政策，去年對平抑物價不無功效，然今年情勢已變，因之能否繼續施行，實有詳加考慮必要。貝氏首對復員初期之經濟情况，作一概括匡述，略謂當時政府忙於復員，國家經濟無一定政策可言，迨去歲年初，上海市塲發生混亂，人民咸望能開放外匯市塲，政府乃於二月下旬公布「外匯開放市塲案」，「進出口貿易暫行辦法」，「中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法」等三案，並於三月四日予以實行，決定將進口物資分成不能進口，限量，及盡量三種。當時因鑒於抗戰八年中物資極缺，故對外貨過口防制不嚴，然絕無允許玻璃絲襪結匯情事。惟執行時，由於進口表項目過多，不無困難，因之滬漢穗等地市進出口商，多至數千家，僅上海一地，即達三四千家，不得不採分工合作辦法，指定若干行家承辦。四五兩月，一般印象極佳，外匯損耗不多，而政府收入因原料出口，外貨進入，增加一倍以上，自春至夏，物價頗為平穩，此其原因大部得歸功政協會議之成功。迨七月以後，游資日增，外來壓力亦重，央行雖有改變匯奉之意，然仍不敢草率從事，正值考慮間，忽米價復見彼動。京滬兩地因缺糧關係，米價日趨上游，至八月十七日乃調整匯率至三三五〇，然商人居奇有術，利用游資，至鄉村購貨。央行乃不得不以黃金抑平物價。此為政府採取黃金政策之濫觴。至玻璃皮包，玻璃絲襪之進口，實非人謀不臧，而因香港走私關係。余（貝氏自稱）去歲赴港，主要原因即為與香港當局商洽如何防止走私。港督對此己有諒解，而英倫政府迄無覆文。此實為始料所不及。外匯　　，亦隨之日增。當局有鑒於此，乃於月前修改進出口條例，期能减少外匯損虧。圾後方有限額辦法之公佈，對進口商，亦開始登記。貝氏又稱，渠可告慰於在座諸君者，即當時所批准之進口商貨品，絕無　袒情事，更無祖詒個人熟識之行家在內也。</p>
<p>貝氏繼分析去歲外匯分配率，指出其中大部份為棉花進口數，總額佔七千六百萬美元。其次為紗，數目七千萬美元，烟類次之，油類又次之，佔五二九零萬美元。化學原料五零三零萬，金屬品三五零零萬。自金鈔政策執行以來，物價雖不免上漲，然去歲三月至六月，八月以後，九月至十一月三個月時期中，物價咸見穩定，足證金鈔政策，並非全無功效，惟至陰曆年底，由於雙青年關，各方開支倍見龐大，情形突見陡變，金鈔政策過去所能收效一時，主要由於國內和平，今年情勢大變，此一政策，能否繼續施行，實有詳細加以考慮必要。貝氏繼分析上海最近金潮原因，謂與各地游資紛紛集滬，大有關係，特別指出山西幫，在滬活動，實對金潮有甚大之影響。貝氏答　共歷時的半小時，條分　析，聽者動容。其最後結論，謂政府新緊急措施方案實行後，法幣雖有出籠危險，然我國國際貿易至今未臻平衡狀態，對上述現象，自無悲觀理由。</p>
<p>立委紛提質詢</p>
<p>〔中央社甫京一日電〕立法院一日上午九時十五分舉行第五次臨時會議，孫院長主席。行政院宋院長子文，蔣秘書長夢麟，兪鴻鈞，王雲五，貝祖詒均列席報告事項後，宋院長起讀財政經濟設施之書面報告並說明渠向主席請辭行政院長職，現已獲准。報告後，立法委員紛紛提出質詢。樓桐蓀指出宋院長就任以來，列席立院此尚為首决。證明過去行政立法兩院聯繫不够，本院去夏即已鑒及危機四伏，惜政院未能共同研討，迨上海金潮發生，政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案，惟內容廣泛，吾人亟欲知其施行多久能預期有何種效果。此方案等於整個國民經濟測騐品，如何能保證其相當成功。宋院長就任後，並無中心政策，頭痛　頭。經濟緊急方案，僅為治標。吾人希望政策恢復正常狀態。周一志謂，北伐時宋氏主持財政，頗為成功，至今一落千丈，　就人謀不臧加以分析，並提出信用問題。鍾復德詢黃金政策有無錯誤，有無黑　，如何安定工人工資。又國營事業旣不許加價，又令其自給自足，殊不可解。張肇元謂：（一）過去政府拋出黃金，在使法幣回籠，現收買黃金，則法幣出籠，游資旣多，必囤積作祟，而使物價漲。（二）銀樓業受限制，全國數百萬職工，因以失業，且無形中取消人民儲蓄方法。（三）檢查黃金，引起不安。宋院長答稱，欲經濟安定，首須政治安定，並謂現已辭職，不欲多言，乃於十時四十六分退席。財政部長兪鴻鈞，經濟部長王雲五，先後就各立委所提問題，一一解答。繼錢天心詢五萬萬外匯基金，尚存若干，陳顧遠指出二中全會決議：（一）增加生產，（二）吸收游資，時至今日，政府不應與民爭利，應與共產黨爭民心。傳統先，陳紫楓·簡貫三，就物價公教人員生活，提出質問。彭醇土責難中央銀行毫無成續，由貝祖詒詳為解答，至十二時四十分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕立法院待審案件甚多，孫院長一日在臨時會議上宣稱：本日尚須舉行會議六次，四日及十一日討論一般例案，廿五·廿七·廿八·廿九四日，則討論有關憲法法規各案。</p>

<p>〔本報北平一日電〕傳作義今日下午六時在十二戰區辦事處接見記者，答記者問如下：（一）察綏地方秩序良好，所有縣份皆經收復，刻每一縣常話都能呌通，每一條公路都能走，平緩路全綫也都能通。（二）目前察綏嚴重困難為衣着缺乏，察北人民於日人統治期間未補新衣已達十年，收復之後，若即從推廣棉花着手，亦屬緩不濟急，省府乃決定採用以糧易布辦法，則省府以購軍糧價款在津中紡公司定購大批棉布，即以批來原價折合軍糧價格發與農民，如此農民繳糧得布，旣解決衣着問題，復可簡化手續，並避免購糧人員壓價不發之弊。（三）春耕間題，察省大戰之後，牲畜損失甚大，省府已決定所有各項名目農貸共十餘億，集中購買若干牲畜，俾擴大春耕。（四）開發綏西問題，如綏西一隅充份開發，則平津一帶糧食即可全部解決，惟改進永利實為此事重要關鍵，刻行總，聯總，綏建應已協力進行，據估計，將各渡口修為新式之鋼筋洋灰口門後，即可灌溉一千萬畝良田。而所需經費，幾十億元即可，至勞動力缺乏問題，已考慮招雇農民前往。（五）包寗路興修已列入五年建設計劇之第一期，如一旦修成，緩西糧食即可源源東運，平綏路取道大同，主要為運煤，大同產煤最高日達八千噸，經濟價值極高，故殊無改道必要，惟長城附近之　溝披度過高，列車須用兩個車頭，顯　　　，故擬改由沚城另關新綫，直趨門頭溝一帶。（六）蒙　問題，察北錫盟尚有共軍，與熱北林東林希共軍呵成一氣，國軍尙未進駐，內蒙問題，國人必須細心週密，求得一妥善辦法。</p>

<h3>民航局策進飛行安全　計劃設「航空路」加強通訊健全氣象測報</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕自交部正式成立民用航空局後，各界對此新機構，寄於極大之希望。據記者探悉：該局目前正忙於規劃策進飛行安全，計兩方面進行，第一，趕建航行輔助設備，正在計劃辦理者，為設置航空路，擬先建設一萬四千英里之航空路，所謂航空路，即具有地面試行輔助設備之航空綫，其主要設備為無綫電導航儀，各種無綫電信號，燈光標誌，使駕駛員在飛行時，可以耳聽目睹，如行路然；其决為擴修機場，計劃先改善國際機塲及其他重要國內機塲，上海機場工程，已經進行，廣州機場工程，亦已擬具計劃。此外並實施航行管制，航路父通管制猶諸陸地上之交通警察，其作用在限止飛機互撞迷途，及减少不必要之延擱，幫助駕駛員完成安全而有規律之航行。該局計劃設置三種航行管制機構：一為航路交通管制站，以輔助管制及指揮在航空路上之飛行；一為機場交通管制站，以管制指揮機塲區域內之飛機起降滑行，通常以機塲周圈三英里為範圍。</p>
<p>該局為　全航空通信等及氣象等起見，現正在各地機場內設置航空通訊站，辦理航行管制之通訊，氣象測報的傳遞，以及向飛楊師播送有關航行之消息，並與中央氣象局密切合作，普遍設置氣象站，健全氣象測報。</p>
<p>該局在另一方面，則加強安全管理。航空安全管理，與其管理氣象不同，可以分為三方面：（一）人員管理，（二）器材管理，（三）機航工作的管理。現該局正在趕訂航空技術人員及航空器材標準，以及航空技術人員檢定及航空器材檢騐等詳細法規章則，在機航工作管理方面，將經常派遣視察員，視察各航空公司之機航工作，與修理設備云。</p>

<h3>政局的新動向</h3>
<p>自去年國民大會閉募之後，中外人士的視綫卽集於改組政府一事；惟因和談未能恢復，各黨派又躊躇不前，以致延宕復延宕，一直到最近，始漸見具體化。民社與靑年兩黨參加四機構（立法院·監察院·國民參政會曁憲政實施促進會）的名單旣已提出，而且各黨派參加立法院監察院暨國民參政會三機構的名單，也已經國防最高委員會通過；至於憲政實施促進會的名單祇要等待國民政府明令公佈就行了。同時行政院長宋子文氏昨晨向立法院報告及解釋政府所採取的經濟政策時，又宣佈他已提出辭呈且業蒙蔣主席照准。昨日下午國防最高委員會臨時會議，且已正式通過，並決定行政院院長職務由蔣主席暫行兼理。這一切的一切，均足以象徵當前的政局，已有新的轉變了。</p>
<p>中國在抗戰勝利之後，全國上下日夜所企求的首為政治民生化。政府為了實現政治民主化起見，曾不顧中共的悍然反對，毅然召開國民大會，制定了一部切實可行的民主憲法，並決定於本年十二月二十五日實施，以實踐其宿諾。現在正是從訓政走到憲政的過渡時期，行憲所有一切必要的準備，都要在這個短短的過渡時期內完成。所以政府渴欲擴大基礎，羅致各黨派的代表及社會賢達，參加各種行政機構，積極進行實施憲政的準備工作。民社與靑年兩黨旣提出名單參加四機構，則更進一步而參加國府委員會與行政院，當亦為不久可以見諸事實。除了弄兵禍國的共黨而外，一切政黨願循正當途徑以與國民黨共同推進民主，實在是當前政治上最可喜的趨勢，我們深信其有明朗實現的一天。</p>
<p>這次行政院長宋子文氏的辭職，雖是政治舞臺上的常事，但無論如何，我們總覺得感觸多端。回想宋氏海外歸來，上臺執政的時候，全國上下莫不寄以無窮的希望。但今日朱氏因金鈔風潮，引起各方的責難，終於掛冠而去，表面看來，似成為「衆矢之的」。這一個懸殊的對照，固為宋氏的不幸，實亦為國家的不幸。平心而論，宋氏為人，自信甚強，其為政亦頗具毅力，在中國敷衍搪塞相習成風的官塲中，固不失為別具風格。所可惜的，惟其自信過強，　不易兼聽，惟其有毅力，故往往流於執抝；加以平時所接觸的範圍，又祇限於經濟金融界之若干人士，而未能默察社會輿情與人民心理的歸趨，以致其所採取之政策，未必卽能對症發藥。宋氏的經濟政策，在今日我們固不願以成敗論人，但他對於「民無信不立」這句最重要的政治格言，缺乏深切的了解，而輕易毀損了人民對於政府的信心，實在是根本癥結所在。宋氏昨日出席立法院報告經濟政策時，亦坦白承認一年以來容有錯誤，仍不失其勇於負責的態度。我們所當注意者，與其說是宋氏辭職，母寗是今後政府的作風。我們認為今後政治唯一的出路，乃在政府與人民眞能打成一片。政府必先視人民乃可與為善者，乃今後建國力量的源泉，而勿概視為作奸犯科之輩。執政者如能時時博訪周諮，深知民隱之所在，決定任何政策，處處為人民着想，則自然取得人民的信任。親民者民亦親之，愛民者民亦愛之。唯有能得人民的合作，政府與人民纔能打成一片，則任何政策，何患杆格難行？這就是國父理想中的「天下為公」，也就是民主政治的眞諦。不論政府如何改組，亦不論實際負行政院責任者將為誰氏，政府第一要義，應先恢復起人民對於政府政策的信心來。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹局勢將有新轉變　英請美經濟援希　雙方在華盛頓進行折衝中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦一日電〕外部發言人今日宣稱，英美兩國正在華盛頓磋商英國對希臘延長經濟援助及軍事義務問題，其中一端擬再貸款，俾希臘得以購買軍火軍備。此項討論係由英軍須履行前此聲明，於三月三十一日退出希臘而起。英軍退出之後，美國方面又不致派軍前往瓜代，而希臘國內不靖，不得不有戒備。據政府其他方面消息，外相貝文擬延緩撤兵日期，於三個月內即至五月底始將所餘英軍一萬名自希臘撤退。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十八日電〕此間英方人士證實英美兩國間正就美國經濟援助希臘之事交換意見，英大使殷佛却貝爾動爵於上星期一曾向馬歇爾國務卿提出照會，釋明英國於三月卅一日以後，不能繼續對希負担財政責任之種種理由，該照會雖未明白表示英軍有退出希臘之意，但曾指出英軍駐在該國，乃英國之重大負担，不堪無定期支持。美國駐希經濟團向國務院所提之報告，所陳亦與英大使之照會相符。國務院決定此一局勢必須向國會領袖陳明，因此乃於昨日請國會領袖包括參院外委會及撥款委員會之主席等，至白宮，向彼等釋明此事關係之重大。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓甘八日電〕今日據傳杜魯門總統如決定接收英國在希臘及土耳其兩國之經濟義務，國會領袖將與以援助，惟同時須權衡此舉對於世界安定及對蘇微妙關係之影饗。外交界及國會方面消息靈通者稱，據倫敦來電，英國國內經濟困窘已瀕破裂，不能再在希臘維持軍隊，並與土耳其以經濟及軍事援助。杜魯門總統於招待記者時，對美國可能擔任英國在希臘所有義務之說，拒絕發表意見，前後四次。但聞杜魯門與國務卿馬歇爾廿七日會在白宮告國會中民主共和兩黨領袖稱，美國若不採取此項行動，最後希臘或不免為共黨所控制。兩黨議員會聽取關於希臘危局之報告，聞均表示杜魯門總統如決定美國應挺身而出，以維持歐洲定案，則甚願追隨其後。惟一部份共和黨議員認為政府於採取最後決定之前，應先向國會及人民詳細說明其方案。</p>
<p>希臘解散共黨團體</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典一日電〕共黨靑年所組織之「埃本」團體，已奉當局命令解散。該一組織頃已向聯合國希臘事實調查委員會及世界民主靑年機構提出抗議。據消息靈通人士稱，政府已改變策略，力主對希臘遊擊隊施以攻勢，例如政府方面之非證實消息，已顯示最近數日間遊擊隊死傷人數激增，其用意或在破壞遊擊隊之士氣，聞政府之特務軍隊準備尚未就緒，故未進攻遊擊隊，恐在三月十五日前，不致有所行動。</p>
<h3>貝文皮杜爾宣布訂立　英法五十年同盟　目的在防範德國再起侵略</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕英法兩國外長今日分別在議會宣布，兩國締結五十年同既條約，已定下星期二簽字，地點則在具有歷史性之法國港口鄧扣克，即上次大戰初期英軍大撤退處。英法兩國與蘇聯均已訂有互助協定，其目的雖特別注意於德國，惟於共同合作，以維持歐洲安全，並改善其經濟狀况，亦皆表示同意。今又宣布第三種倏的，完成對德之一環，在英國下議院及法國國民議會中發表時議員均各歡聲雷動。據貝文外相宣稱：此項條約為英法兩國友誼結合之明證。法外長皮杜爾之聲明，結尾提及英法同盟條約，惟貝文與皮杜爾兩人對於條文內容均未宣布。該約係於一月前勃魯姆訪問倫敦，與艾德禮首相及貝文外相談話時原則上獲同意。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕貝文外相在下院宣布英法盟約定於三月四日星期二在鄧扣克簽字，渠於啓程赴莫斯科時，中途將在該地會同法外長皮杜爾簽訂盟約。兩外長旣抵莫斯科，預料將保證盟約之並非針對任何第二者。本社外交記者預料蘇聯之首次反響必將為猜疑的表示，須俟得以具體證明盟約並非組織西歐集團之第一步時，誤會始可望冰釋。</p>
<h3>英法盟約要點</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕關於英法兩國盟約之內容，頃悉其要點如次：（一）德國若採取侵略政策，或採取足以威脅兩國安全之態度，則英法將採取何種性質之措置，應由兩國進行談判討論之；（二）英法兩國間之一國若與德國作戰，則另一國不問此項衝突是否為德國武裝侵路之結果，均應立即在軍事上予以一切援助；（三）德國若本能履行其所負之義務時，則英法兩國應互相磋商，以採取一切必要之步驟；（四）在經濟方面，英法兩國亦應就有關雙方利益之問題，互相磋商；（五）英法兩國依照此項盟約之規定，所當採取之行動，必須處處顧及兩國對於聯合國憲章所負之義務云。</p>

<h3>鮑威爾略歷</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>鮑威爾生於一八八六年，卒業於美國密蘇里大學新開學院。一九一七年來華，任密勒氏評論報編輯兼發行人，並担任芝加哥講壇報，曼撤斯特導報等特約記者，報導中國情况，極受國際輿論界之重視。一九二三年吾國政府曾頒給勛章。鮑氏主持密勒氏評論報甚久，抗戰開始後，對於日軍之侵略及野蠻行為，屢加揭發，抨擊不遺餘力，致逍日方疾恨。太平洋戰爭爆發後，氏被拘人集中營，備受凌虐，勝利釋出後，即返美休養，但健康己遭摧毀，雙腿半廢，不良於行。去年東京國際軍事　　審訊日本戰犯，鮑氏會拘病赴東京，出庭作證，事後原擬再來滬一行，訪晤舊好，惟因身體不適，遵醫囑逕行返美治療，雙足皆被截去。近來鮑氏健康已大見恢復，曾屢次表示極願再度來華，不料竟於前日在密蘇里大學同學會發表演說後，突然逝世。</p>

<p>三月一日開辦的國際貨幣基金「國際貨幣基金」此刻正在收受會員國繳付的資金，以便日後需要基金協助償付進口的國家提用。這項國際匯兌工作原是穩定世界貨幣的基金計劃的主要部分，已預定於三月一日開始進行。</p>
<p>到那時三十九個基金會員中，至少有三十二價將繳納其名下的黃金與本國貨幣，自此以後他們便可在需要時購買外國通貨以避免暫時的外匯困難。</p>
<p>推行計劃的第一步是基金管理人葛特（Camille　Gutt）釐訂了三十二國通貨的最初代價，此後除非由於他們對外貿易情形的主要困難而必需予以調整時，不得改換最初的匯率。所有最初比價都以目前的匯兌率為凖繩。</p>
<p>另外七個國家與二個殖民地——巴西，中國，多米尼加，希臘，波蘭，烏拉圭，南斯拉夫，法屬印度支那，荷屬東印度——因為通貨或重建問題仍待解決，所以在確定通貨最初比價前予彼等基金管理處從長計議的時間。</p>
<p>比價猶未確定的國家，將准其延晚支付名下應繳的資金。因此基金開始時僅有資金六十五萬二千五百萬美元，當三十九國一體參加時，資本將增為七十五萬七千美元。此外四個新會員國已准予加入，這四國是義大利，土耳其，叙利亞與黎巴嫩，它們的款項加入後，總數將達七十七億美元</p>
<p>基金是國際匯兌中的新試騐。它與世界銀行是姊妹機構，世界銀行導源於一九四四在布里教森林召開的貨幣會議。該行任務是供給會員國長期信用借款；基金則是適應匯兌上的短期需要，即維持通貨價值的穩定與供給各國國外貿易所需通貨，負起通貨互相目由匯兌的責任。貨幣問題策劃人認為這是重建世界貿易的必要條件。現在基金將開始工作，瞭解這一機構如何工作的詳情是很重要的。</p>
<p>支持基金的是黃金與各會員國的通貨。各國認款數量已在布里敦森林會議中決定。每一會員國都同意付一部份黃金，其餘則付以各該國的通貨。據估計原來認款的三十九國交付後，支持基金的黃金輿美元總數為三十六億元。其中美國部份為黃金六萬八千七百五十萬元，美金二十萬零六千二百五十萬元。美國認款共計二十七萬五千萬元，佔基金資本百分之三十七。其他三十八國應付黃金八萬五千萬元興各國通貨合值美金三十八萬七千萬元。</p>
<p>認款次多國是英國，黃金與英鎊十三億元；中國，黃金與法幣五萬五千萬元，法國，黃金與法郎五萬二千五百萬元；印度，黃金與盧比四億元。法國原來認款四萬五千萬元，但基金董事會應法國之請增至現在的數目。它這一請求是為增加它今後對基金提用的權力。</p>
<p>通貨價值將在一長時期內逐漸予以調整。在起始時基金以現行匯率為準，但申明以後茶些貨幣的比價將有所調準。這就是美金要使各國通貨價值能互相吻合，不致有一國會因通貨人為的高價或低價在貿易中佔到便宜。</p>
<p>會員國同意在依基金協約條款改變價值前維持最初法定比價。基金建立這一壁壘目的在制止通貨戰爭。競以貶值來爭取出口利益是過去引起通貨極度波動的原因，現在已經各國協議取消。</p>
<p>許多國家以保護他們外國通貨準備的通貨控制也將逐漸消除。基金會承認像法國等受戰爭削弱的國家需要對以後用美金購貨的公民貴施某種控制。同時法國與其他會員國同意在可能範團內緩和道些限制。給興法國解除控制的年限是五年。如果它失敗了，就將失去提取基金的權利，在這種情形下最後它還可能失去會員的資格。</p>
<p>開始時由基金售出的通貨可能全部是美金。這種通貨是會員國所最需要的，因為美國是世界上主要的供應者。下述情形可作為例證：法國需要購買美國貨的美金比它所握有的多。它可向基金申謂一萬三千一百二十五萬美金，這數目是法國項下的四分之一，也是它一年內可購用的最高數。基金確定它有歸還能力而購買美金用途適當，便批准申請。</p>
<p>法國拿到美金得付入相同金額的法郎。兌換率根據基金所定兩國通貨的法定比價。法國同意在可能範圍內迅速還，歸還後即將法郎收回。同時法國需向基金會付手續費處利息。百分之〇·七五手續費立即償付。利息則在三月後起付百分之〇·　五，以後逐漸增加，四年後加至百分之四，十年後加至百分之五。因此法國要迅速將法國貨獻給美國，以便儘速還款。</p>
<p>基金協定嚴格限制通貨價值的變動。然而它承認某幾種最初的比率並不代表眞實的價值，某幾種通貨的價值在沒有找到適當的永準前可以有幾次變動。調整將有下述的經過：假定以後法國發現法郎最初法定比價——一一九對美金一元——太高，對它以法國價格銷貨到外國不利。法國價格可以降低，但可能引起國內蕭條。因此法國法郎貶值百分之十通知基金會。百分之十的貶值無需徽得基金會同意。</p>
<p>但假定法郎價格仍嫌太高。那末再度貶值就必需徵得基金會同意，基金會祇有在廉價法郎為維持國外貿易地位必需時才予以批准。</p>
<p>因此超過百分之十的變動，便屬於國際控制範圍之內，一般認為如此可以阻止任何非必要的更動。與這種情形相反的是從前無限制的波動，法國法郎從一九二九的合三角九分二美金，到一九三三升為合五角三釐，到一九三五又升到合六角六分，而到一九三七跌為合美金四角五釐，一九三八跌到二角八分八，一九四〇為二角八釐，一九四五為一角九分七，到一九四六最後為八分三釐九。</p>
<p>穩定世界貿易是貨幣計劃的最終目標。假定以法國為例，有一年它酒的收成不好。如果它不能把酒賣給美國，將暫時缺少買所需美國貨的資金。將影響法美兩國的貿易情形。所以為渡過這一難關，法國可向基金會去取得它所需要的美金。</p>
<p>基金會握有的美金源源流出的危險是一開始便會遇到的。於是它得以拒絕會員國目動伸展攝取的權力，堅持謹慎審查申請者用途與歸還能力。一基金會所負任務極大。它成功的與吾不僅繫於基金會本身的努力，更有賴於各會員國能否解決國內幣制與生產的困難。穩定的世界幣制不是一蹴而成的。（美國新聞處）</p>
<h3>韓國紀念獨立節　國仙外反對託管要求獨立</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢城一日電〕今日為朝鮮獨立日，全境均將實行宵禁。就以往經騐觀，今日往往為暴動甚至發動革命之一日，美國諜報人員已發現鮮人將於三月一日左右暴動之計劃，故今日或仍不免有動亂之點綴。韓南美軍司令已下令加意戒備，伺時並發出警告，指出如有人惡意暴動，適足中傷關懷朝鮮者之好意，將使後者以為朝鮮人民旣不願與籌備朝鮮獨立之機構合作，則朝鮮或尚不宜獨立。同時朝鮮國內外反對託管之宣傳仍層出不窮，右派領袖仍堅持要求實行彼等於一月十四日通過之三點計劃，即：（一）反對莫斯科宣言中託管朝鮮之規定；（二）組織全國性朝鮮獨立運動；（三）派代表團赴美蘇兩國要求立即獨立。右翼集團同時並發起要求麥克阿瑟將軍，檢討朝鮮局勢，若干黨對此一要求均表示支持。然左翼及右冀對於莫斯科會議均寄於甚大希望，欲使朝鮮問題至少將獲部份解決。</p>

<p>一場噩夢裏驚醒過來　察哈爾進入新方向  張家口十六日快訊　本報駐察記者竭忠　　戰亂的摧殘，　　省受到嚴重的創傷，紛亂　爛，滿目療　，像經過暴風雨的蛛網，頭緒萬千，處處破綻，社會需要在安定中復蘇，人民需要在安定中喘息，對政治的渴望超過了軍事的比重。只有好的政治才能保證軍事的成果，才能解決人民的生活。國軍從進人張垣四個月來，忙於軍事戡亂，恢復秩序的工作。各級行政機構雖已確立，編制經費還未充實，今天察省政治是剛在開端，也是初經考騐。面臨血淚斑斑的現實，政治上特別需要明快，果斷，與把握重點。傳作義將軍不僅是出色的將領，而且且備優秀的政治才幹。治兵理政，都有辦法。在綏遠主政十八年，留下豐功偉蹟，軍事上的成就，形成邊疆的安定力量。現在他又以堅定的步伐，雄偉的魄力，和充滿樂觀的信心，担起艱難困苦的工作，修整道一幅破碎的河山，要將察哈爾成為鞏固的國防，人民的樂園。　　民主時代人民第一　　記得在一次茶會席上，記者們稱頌傳將軍的功勛，傳將軍謙遜的說：「我是一個鄉村出身的土頭兒，沒有什麼長人的本領，只是我所做的，都是照着人民的意志來做。」他指出綏包集寗張垣一連出的勝利，就是人民意志的勝利，「民主時代，人民第一」·一切為人民為兵士，亦許就兌他成功的主要條件。他瞭解人民的疾苦，士兵的生活，認識所有幹部，和瞭解他的家庭一樣熟悉。他知道人民希望什麽，更知道如何滿足人民的希望。他提出目前察省政治中心任務為「安定第一，生產至上」，而從「廉能政治」做起。　　人才下鄉經費下鄉　　安定是生產的保障，一切政治實施的前提，安定不單是軍事的枚平，綏靖工作僅是一個重要部份，尤其是要實行民主政治。傅將軍處處把人民利益擺在第一位，一民主時代主權屬於人民，利益屬於人民。如此才能發動人民熟情，政治亦才有力量。」他這樣的愛人民，人民亦同樣的尊敬和相信他。　　整理這樣繁難複雜的環境，需要領導與力量的集中，綏西八年抗戰，傅將軍運用黨政軍團一元化的領導，曾發揮，很大效果，軍政官民一體是力量的源泉。今天察省的復員，還佔這個便宜。察省的行政陣容相當的硬棒，各級幹部都充滿着靑年氣象、緊張積極，冒險犯難。他們曾在艱難中奮鬥，在困苦中成長，工作戰鬥緊緊的連結在一起，龍關縣長賈子峻任中殉職；康保縣長許樹人智退敵人，都傳為佳話，成了榜樣。現為了健全縣鄉機構，正在動員「人才下鄉，經費下鄉。」以強化層基的組織。　　優良傳統艱苦作風　　傳將軍常這樣訓誨自己的部屬，一當一個建國幹部眞不容易，建國期間，人民對官吏是要求將來，不是報酬過去。人民已相信三民主義為建國準繩，但對執行主義的人，人民有權選擇，邱吉爾戴高樂對英法不都是功勛彪炳的人物，但在大戰後競選均遭失敗，我們是否能得到人民的支持，是要看我們能否為人民福利有所表現。」「建國時期政治上最大敵人是貪汚腐化。所以特別要實行「廉能政治，」廉的表現是艱苦，能的表現是積極，我們要用艱苦奮鬥來創造優良環境，改善人民生活。」他的行動，給他的言論作了有力保證。艱苦作風是這個區域的優良傳統，官兵官民生活一致不知為國家節省多少物資，拯救多少幹部，十八世耙的生產，絕不應作二十世紀的享受，所以他持別嚴格要求幹部，「生活水準不能超過待遇，待遇與生活，不必儘求一致，要普遍提高大衆的生活水準，而不願見僅僅少數幾個人的生活優裕。」這一切都從自我作起表裏一致。這裏幹部能安心工作，積極奮勉，未始不是領導者的成功。　　政府信心人民企望　　綏靖工作是政治第一課，要地方安定必嚴密保甲，淸查戶口，「今年要做到人必歸戶，戶必歸甲，使得一個壞人不能隱藏，一句流言不能散佈。經過嚴密的調查統計，全省在國軍控制區域內共編成三三〇三保二八七三二甲，人口一九三七三九四人，男人一〇四六四五六口，壯丁二三四四四三口。並利用人民自衛熟情，通過自衛組織，發揮自衛力量，做到自衛的完成。」是的，鞏固治安需要建立在人民力量的基礎上。　　各縣民意機構，最近就要成立，四月中辦理縣參議會的選舉，我們希望「民主」不是招牌，更不是口號，把民權交給人民，讓民主變成行動，「在眞正代表民意的機關下，政令由上而下的准行，通過民意機關的協助而更有力，並將民意由下而上的反映，供政府採擇實行做到，政府為人民服務，人民作政府後盾。」這是政府的信心，人民的企望。　　注視春耕擬具計劃　　春耕的問題，嚴實而又迫切，當局是賦予極大注意，針對人民的需要，貸放籽種耕牛和農具都有詳細計劃，其實政府已往給人民的救濟，量少遲緩，人民為了生活在沒辦法中終還能找出辦法。人民對政府希望的是安定少煩擾，我們特別強調「除弊重於興利」的原則，與軍隊配合肅淸共軍的騷擾使人民獲得從事生產保障，另外减少人民差徭，解決土地科紛，流散在鄉間的「雜牌」部隊或編或散，不讓再在鄉村擾亂地方，妨害耕種，這都是春耕前應排除的障礙。這些在鼓勵生產的當局，亦都注意到了。至於興辦水利，　井灌溉，當局雖亦在積極準備，但說來容易，做起來難，我們先不必開這張支票。　　救濟工作。做的相當活躍，善救工作隊的物資源源而來，每一個地區收復，辦理急賑的人員總是隨軍而至，只是需要救濟的人太多，實有「儈多粥少」之感。有時領到些西裝洋服，女人輸子兒童鞋，穿起來哭笑不得。或者領幾桶牛奶罐頭，怎能救得了人民飢荒？　　改進教育培植師資　　敵人八年的奴化教育，中共一年的赤化教育，將這一代純潔的幼苗，注入毒素，埋伏禍根，使他們對國家民族的意識很模糊，人倫道德的觀念亦淡薄。「崇禮縣有一七十多歲的老太婆，被八路軍捆起，他的孫子是一個村幹部，當她向他的孫十討饒時，反一而被一槍射死！」這就是中共教育的傑作。「加強鬥爭意識」正是中共歌頌的英雄行為！所以今天收復區的教育，不僅要復興，而且要澈底改造，察省是先從培植師資着手，每縣至少要設一所簡師，質量並重，逐步走到一保一小學的地步。現全省中學生不過二千人，少得可憐，專科以上的學校還沒有一處開學。　　電廠被毀光明有待　　下花園的電廠，破壞的實在可惜，日寇建築四年還沒有完工，一旦成功，六萬克羅瓦特的電力，可使平緩沿綫的城鎭變得通亮。經共軍「卓越」的破壤。現在連自身都需要供給光明。靠電力發動的工廠都停了擺，不用電力的機器，共軍早把它搬運到「根據地」。資源委員會計劃修復這一個工程，可是經費，技術，器材，還都沒有着落，欲事受光明，尚有一段遙遠的路程。　　察省人民目前雖還在眼淚嘆息中摸索，但已有了新的啓示。暴風雨過去了，像經過一塲噩夢，新的希望孕育着新的信念，「生存」與「生活」的要求，會融匯成宏偉的力量，向著一個新的方向推進。讀者意見規約　　（一）本價絕對公開，文實自負。但切忌冗長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆明。（四）本欄稿件概不致訓。（五）對來稿本報有　節之權（六）來稿被披露與否，概不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　民辦消防可以取法　　上月武定路大火事件，市民因不滿市屬消防隊而發出消防民辦的呼聲，而本案調查委員會葛主委張處長等所以特地來視察滬南區民辦的消防會，聽取毛會長華主任的報告，據告該會創辦遠在遜淸同治年間。距今已七十餘年，牠能保持這樣悠久的光榮歷史，倒不在乎經濟條件的充裕，而是義勇服務精神所支持，筆者認為毛會長所謂「有錢誰都辦得好。沒錢誰都辦不好」這兩句話，對民辦消防事業是不盡然的，要知凡為公共福利事業，只要民衆把牠當做自己的事業一樣，前途一定很光明的，所以我對滬南消防會寄予深切的期望。　　自從本市武定路一次大火之後，正是滿城風雨，街議巷談茶坊酒肆，侃侃而論。其是非曲直，已在報紙上公開披露；一切眞相逐漸明朗，總而言之，經濟是一個重要問題。但精神未嘗不是一個重要間題。所以經濟設備和義勇精神，都是不可偏廢的一個基本因素。再輔之以道德行為，始可造成美滿的結果。在本月九日，閱讀貴報特寫武定路大火案調委會葛主委張處長王葉雨科長和十多位記者先生，因為哄動一時消防民辦的呼聲中，所以特地來視察滬南區民辦的消防。究竟成效如何，事後發表一篇新聞，以向社會一般開心消防人仕。雖經毛會長華主任在胖福精密的報告之下，闡述從動淸同治十三年創辦到現在，經過四十多年，覺得有這樣悠久的歷史而不受到淘汰和沒落，在這一點事項觀察起來，所以能保特歷久不衰，民辦消防義勇的盛譽和國家褒獎的光榮，絕斷不是僥倖所得到的，而實在是精神和義勇所造成的。檢討毛會長所說「有錢誰都辦得好，無錢誰都辦不好」這兩句，完全指點經濟而言，對於義勇精神和這德行為，想必沒有充分時間來提及。决由葛委員詢問南區主任朱匡時君（本屆市參議員）對於此次武定路大火的感想怎樣，朱主任不加思素的說：（有消防隊施救而拖這樣久時間是不應該的）。其所說祗對於施救不力，也沒有談到義勇精神和道德上去。雖然在救火塲上攫取他人的物件，是有損道穗名譽及犯法曁有關整個消防組織，可是也不能諱莫如深的略而不談而實有追究和檢討的必要。不能因為犯法刑事部份，已交法院辦理告一段落，同時更要警惕將來絕對不可再有同樣事故發生。倘使認為已過者作罷，則未來的不幸可能不斷的滋生。朱主任雖則寥寥兩句，礦使民辦的消防前途，加起無限的掛慮，千萬可不能也造成十三小時以上的火災及類如武定路不良的情形，否則是就要遭到一種更強有力的反應。因為滿口飯是可吃，滿口話是不可說的。而今朱主任話已出口，更要希望一輩義勇消防員，大家都應當提足精神，切實服務來補救朱主任所說的幾句話。視察結果。最後得到的評語：官辦的是「抱想和嘆氣」，而滬南區民辦的卻一切顯得很安靜和有條環。所得到的感想什麽公共事業，只要人民把它當做自己的事業，它的前途才有希望。這幾句準確的結論，足見得長官賢明明察秋毫，以及記者先生的妙筆輿論宣傳，並十二萬分祈望不斷的匡助，使民辦的公共事業，開放着燦爛之花而結成良好的果。自經過武定路一次教訓和刺激以後，凡遇火警，對於火塲上出水迅速，舉動敏　，個個奮勇，事事當先，較之以前判若天壤。知恥近乎勇的一句格言，希望永久保持不忘纔是！（劉梅一）　　漕涇鎮道路要趕修　　編者先生：滬西漕河鎮，自從公用局的郊區公共汽車曁祥生交通公司的滬漕專車，於喪年相繼通車以來，交通方面，可說是便捷多了，惟一遺憾的；就是路政太差，自市區至龍舉一段，還算可以，只是籠牽至漕河連鎭的一段，尤其是那條中山西路，—自龍華塔至土山灣一節，實在太不興了！這一節路上，滿佈着大小深淺不等的坑窿，軍行其上，顛簸起伏，非筆　所可形容，即如小型轎車，亦在在有傾覆的危險，希望工務周迅即派工修理，如果絀于經費，可先用幾噸碎石子，把那些洞一一塡滿，再用些煤屑舖平，好在路綫又不長，不通千五百公尺左右，目下天時漸緩，這一條路上往來的軍輛，逐漸增多，故而籲請及早修理，以免發生意外為幸。（上海市第二十六區第三四五保聯合辦事處薛林生啓）　　代郵　　復陳金蘇星生兩君，來函指陳福善鄉情形，頃得江蘇省政府函稱：一已飭江陰縣政府查辦矣。」祈洽運河流域發動水利工程　勘察淮陰閘壩　　導淮委員會於民國甘五年建成之淮陰船閘，在城西北六公里，為蘇北水利工程之一。運河（能容納六百噸以下船舶）之終年通航，兩岸農田之灌溉，胥蒙其利。又楊莊活動壩，為淮河入海水道之控制工程，扼中山河之咽喉，位於淮陰城西北八公里，於民國二十六年完成。淪陷期間，迭遭敵偽肆意破壞，業已面目全非。凡可能以人力折毀者，如鋼門木料，啓閉機件等，均被拆卸一空，即深埋地面以下之鋼板椿及混凝土中之脹縮鋼筋等，亦不能倖免。管理所房屋片瓦無存，夷為平地，實為蘇北水利建設之重大損失。該會為恢復上項工程計，已派遣工程人員前往各閘壩，從事勘查，計劃，分別修復。圖示淮陰閘壩之現狀：　　（上）淮陰船閘：閘門及啓閉機等均被拆毀。（中）楊莊活動壩毀壞情形。（下）脹縮鋼筋被　情形。（周玉山攝寄）四審谷壽夫　昔日屠刀聲霍霍　今卻要賴前賬  本報特約記者丁匡華　　谷壽夫，給南京人民冤仇太深了，他縱容部下屠殺南京四十萬人民，是痛，是恨，是血，是淚，屠夫的命運，受法庭的裁判，當然是該得碎屍萬斷的。　　接連三次的大審，有被害家屬的申訴，有親臨危書的供陳，有國際友人正義的伸張，勵志社一片「殺」「淫」「姦」「虜」的呼聲慘絕人寰，忍心的屠夫，兇容猙獰，猶在堂上狡辯，推諉責任，實在「該殺」「該殺」。　　今（廿五）天是公審屠夫的第四次，仍由石美瑜少將任庭長，九時升堂，谷壽夫由六位憲兵押了上來，一個老年裝束，頹喪的樣子，己不似前决那樣自在，大概是受了「骨」「血」的良心驅使吧！　　石庭長宜佈開庭後，首先設詢替谷壽夫作證的小笠原淸，據供，「攻入南京的部隊，是在十二日午後，由中山門入城，谷壽夫的部隊，是十三日淸晨由中華門入城的。那時權在柳川，谷壽夫不過是攻南京被指揮的部隊而已。」自然，誰都有國族觀念，小笠原淸的反證，自屬替本國人辯護，沒有值得我們重視的哩。　　谷壽夫殺人心虛石美瑜嚴厲駁斥　　谷魔隨即作無賴之狡辯：「攻城部隊有一一四及十八師團之一部，直屬及特加部隊，何能專指被告部隊有犯罪行為，同時庭上所召集之被害人，全以對日人之怨恨，集施於被告一身，旣不能置信，更不能作為有力之罪證，而加害人之番號及姓名，亦無具實供敍，在地點而言，又非被告部隊所轄，在時間上，亦多在被告部隊調遣之後，或在激戰之中，在實况而言當時戰地實處於無人之境，故此種證人，實屬一種假想，也是偽造者根據此種呈述而判決實非公平之事，請庭上根據事實，秉公處理」石庭長不待翻譯譯述完畢，即以嚴厲的詞令駁斥，「被告上級司令官或部下，旣不能出庭作證，本庭仍需秉公處斷，幾十萬慘殺的人民，旣不能作被告之罪證，常然需要調查，並非立即判決，被告為何能先知其不公，此足可證明殺人者心虛，從新發現證據上，被告所統馭的軍隊，在中華門一帶，屠殺數字約有七千餘人，二十八年一月南京偽督辦高冠吾所書立之孤魂石碑，可資佐證一，孤魂石碑之紙印版，即由庭上遞於谷魔眼前，攝影記者於此時忙碌拍攝此一屠殺痕跡，實代替數千人發言也。　　一本「陷都血淚」替市民清算　　　　海軍總司令部的吳處長出庭作證，詳述日軍於攻陷南京後之種種殘暴行為。但在吳處長被詢之後，谷犯却狡猾的回答道：「剛才證人所陳說的，不知與被告有什麼關係！」原因被告是被動者，主角是柳川大將，妄想一句話，將他血腥的責任推得乾乾淨淨這時候，石庭長將「陷都血淚錄」陳列堂上，幷傳此書的作者現在陸大將官班受訓之郭歧少將出庭作證。他說那時日軍攻入南京的暴行，罄竹難書，這裏所列舉的，不過是滄海一粟而已，我所寫的，都是當時目擊事實，我絕對負責，我寫此文的目的，原在紀念死難同胞，想不到今天，會擺在法庭，巷四十萬生靈作證。亦是意外之收穫了，郭少將隨即提出日軍暴行種種：（一）日兵要三十餘農民於中華門外塘中捉魚，天寒水凍，入水者均不准復上而凍斃，不入水者即被殺死。（二）日兵於中華門外強姦婦女後，又命其子再奸其母。（三）有一婦女改男裝經過中華門，被日兵識破，即會同時路過之五男子輪姦比女，男子不肯，恰巧有一和尚經過，日兵即放過五個男子，逕命和尚與此女性交，和尚因拒絕而死在槍下。（四）日兵將一老頭高吊在中華門樹上，一面瞄準射擊打斷繩索，老人跌死，而引為樂。（五）在國際委員會地避難之婦女，日兵每晚偷入，逐個奸淫，名之曰摸魚。（六）日兵以救濟為名，引來婦女，並探知住處，入夜後，即前往奸淫。名曰釣魚。……此上的暴行，都是十二日至十七日的發生的。　　當翻譯官翻譯之後，谷壽夫張大眼睛，狡猾的問：「請證人說出加害部隊的字，番號。如果不能指出部隊番號，這些事實，是不足為證的。」這時大家都怒目疾視這該死的東西。　　「朝日新聞」誇戰功充作了「自招」鐵證　　這時，石美瑜庭長告訴他另一僩有力證件，那是英法各國當時所組成的國際委員會，曾經對日軍當時的罪行有詳細的記載，單是殺人強姦罪行案子，就有四二五件之多，並且還有以殺人為比賽殘酷舉動。據說當時殺人，最多的是一個日兵，曾經殺了七〇五人，但後來另一個日兵，却打破紀錄，殺了七〇六人！這些事實，在「朝日新聞」上，也登載過，此外又拿出一本照相簿給谷犯看，那都是日軍自己拍攝的，照片上滿是日軍在以殺人為取樂的野蠻無人性的眞實紀錄！　　當谷壽夫看了那些照片之後，先是啞口無言，用手抹了他一下小鬚子說：「在檢察庭上時，也看到過類似這樣的照片，當時見到那樣殘忍的情形，非常驚異也是非常慚愧的事情。不過我在中華門只住了很短的一個時期，部隊在匆促之間，很難做出那些事，照片上的事實，不能說明是在中華門發生。　　兩小時狡辯不息屠夫否認殺人罪　　下午二時，繼續開庭，谷犯滔滔長辯，歷時兩句鐘，內容全係否認與不承認之言詞。谷犯首謂：被告不是中華門最高指揮官，參加進攻中華門者，尚有一一四師團及十八師團之一部，生平治軍嚴明，暴行發生，多在被告部隊駐紮區域之外，或在被告率部離京之後，許多罪行時間及地點均無具體事實足資證明，如此以被告為暴行主犯，實屬不合理與不公正。再就罪行調查表，證人及起訴書三方面，予以狡辯。強調謂其部屬不曾有強姦，殺人，破壤財產等行為，末謂：由美籍證人，電影照片等人證，物證觀之，所有暴行，多半發生於安全區及下關等地區，倘謂此乃被告部隊所為，實不公平及錯誤。且被告：（一）身為軍人，到中國作戰，為奉命而來，不能負戰爭罪或侵略罪。（二）屠殺之事，則完全未曾聽說。况軍隊紀律甚嚴，旣非目覩，亦未聽居民報告，可以證明無屠殺發生。（三）以上所提證據，均為偽證。此為中國人民為復仇而出此，况被害者均在別軍駐地。即有亦不能負責，（四）攻打中華門時，戰况激烈，當地居民，即不能有軍民混合居現象。即不能發生強奸及殺人等事。證人所提屠殺在十二日至十四日最多，與事實不符。　　辯護律師梅祖芳亦提出兩點理由，代為辯護。這審訊照例的「過場」，不過消逝時光而已！　　至此，檢察官陳光虞起立發言，嚴正予以駁斥，陳氏謂：像這樣殺人魔王，人間屠夫，豈容存亡嗎？應請庭上處以極刑；……。陳檢察官的話，聲嘶有力，大家報以熱烈的掌聲。</p>

<p>春秋	大癡作風與四王山水  施翀鵬　　董思翁論文人畫，强分山水畫爲南北宗，推王維爲南宗鼻祖。他說：「文人之畫，自王右丞始，其後董源，巨然，李成，范寬爲嫡子，李龍眠，王晋卿，米南宮及虎兒，皆從董巨得來，直至元季四大家，黃子久，王叔明，倪元鎮，吳仲圭皆其正傳。吾吳文沈，則又遠接衣缽；若馬夏及李唐，劉松年，又是大李將軍一派。」這種揚南抑北的感情見解，很不可靠。試看王晋卿以上至王維諸家的山水，都是謹嚴刻實，雖然較勝於李思訓的鈎勒刻畫，但是澹泊瀟洒的氣息，畢竟絕無而僅有；尤其王維的山水，曾見故宮藏本「雪霄圖」一幀，皴法如鐵綫，設色和大李將軍的青綠一樣地濃重，正如米友仁所說：「王維畫，見之極多，皆如刻畫，不足學」。而張彥遠稱：「王維工畫山水，體涉古今，」可是我們從未見過他「今體」的水墨山水，也無從臆斷。蘇東坡頌揚王維山水有「蕭然出塵之姿」，也許是一種想像的感覺罷了。　　其次，北宋三家中的董北苑，喜寫江南山水，山巔多雲氣，史家稱他，「水墨似王維，設色如李思訓」，我們看他「龍宿郊民圖」「洞天山堂」等幾幅著名作品，也都偏於厚重一格，未脫鈎勒的意味，至於李成范寬的山水，水墨之作，很少發現，如「谿山行旅」，「瑤峯琪樹圖」等，都是雄奇峻偉有餘，而澹泊恬靜不足，董思翁硬把他們歸納在水墨渲染的南宗畫派中，真有些偏見。　　依我個人的看法，惟有米南宮父子，才是純粹的水墨渲染的山水，高房山是米氏的嫡傳。可是米高是偏重「點」的渲染，而忽略了「綫」的揮洒，直到黃子久崛起，融會董巨米高諸家的筆墨皴擦，才開闢了山水畫上一道「點綫面」的康莊，成功了承先啓後的劃時代畫家。和子久同時而年事較青的倪王吳三家，便首先受到他的影響。因爲子久以前的山水，都是有面無綫，或者有點無綫，有綫無點；子久以後，才有十全十美的「點綫面」俱備的山水畫法。惲南田嘗稱子久的畫是：「雄秀蒼茫，極變化之致，脫繁簡之迹，出畦徑之外，　神明之運，發造化之秘。」我們在故宮看見的大癡富春圖卷，雖然很多鑑賞家指爲贗品，可是和南田的批評，却是正相脗合。我們也見過倩庵家藏的大癡富春山燼餘本真蹟，用筆流利輕鬆，用墨變化多端，不簡不繁，掃盡北宋人的獷悍覇辣的面目，一派天真神妙，澹泊恬靜的氣息，流露在邱壑樹梢間。這不是說：子久以前董巨李范的山水進都不及子久，而是說明山水畫作風，到了子久發生了極大的轉變。　　子久以後的畫家，無論倪雲林，王叔明，吳仲圭，以及文徴明，沈石田，董其昌，乃至於清代諸家，莫不受子久作風的重大影響，支配了五百年來的山水畫。尤其是四王——烟客，廉州，石谷，麓台。　　四王山水儘是取法乎荆關董巨，可是用筆用墨，章法佈局，總是跳不過大癡的樊範，脫不盡大癡的面目，大癡山水是取董巨的「綫」——披麻皴，米高的「點」，——米點，荆關的面，——荆浩兼道子之筆，項容之墨，便是渲染的「面」，如此凑合融會而成的。在明清兩代，學者奉大癡爲圭臬的山水作風，有如萬流朝宗，百川歸海的繁盛。董其昌是介乎明清的交替時期，四王中時敏，廉州都曾獲交於思翁，思翁便是從大癡入手，而上躋於米高山水的一位大家，直接簡接加强了大痴作風的勢力；使四王忠實地默守了大痴宗法，造成牢不可破，千篇一律的局面；因此四王山水，常常引起時人的批評，甚至批評四王的山水，等於科舉時代的八股文章。　　四王山水，旣皆忠於大痴，狹小脆弱，自然是難免的現象；然而四王也有特異而成功的作品。同時，四王距今不遠，真本流傳的很多，除故宮庋藏的四王之外，私人收藏的爲數亦不在少。最近在梅景屋看到四張同樣尺幅，同是仿大痴的墨筆山水，王時敏，王廉州，王石谷，王農台，四幅如出一手，其中用筆以農台最爲蒼勁，用墨以廉州最感濃重，石谷此幀，較之其他石谷所作，邱壑筆墨，都覺別緻。烟客自題「戊子長夏倣子久筆意」廉州題：「近代學子久者甚多，惟董思翁有出藍之妙，余此畫復師文敏，恐不免爲東家施耳。擲筆惘然！癸已五月鑑識」，石谷自題：「大痴翁秋山霧雨圖，曾獲見董華亭臨本，秀潤之致，溢於腕外，此追擬之，恐未得其仿彿也。辛卯冬日耕烟散人王翬」，農台自題：「此幅以富春大嶺爲本，參用陡壑密林爲子方作，筆意由淡入濃之法，庶幾近之，余近作二圖，一爲梅道人，一爲此幅，有意求逸而不得自主，方知逸趣在天人之間，學者可不於心目相應處求其三昩乎？隨筆識之。已丑十月朔日寫於京師雙籐書屋農台祁」。　　看了此四幀四王山水之後，參看他們的題識，益信大痴的作風，在明清兩代的畫壇，幾乎有「天下之美，無有異於大痴矣」！的感慨。詩談片  藍本　　人生是短暫的，詩人不能因時代的低氣壓而停止其創造。　　沒有詩而有靈感的人或許可能成詩人，沒有靈感而有詩的人，却只能是匠人。論木刻的形式與內容  劉峴　　我國的木刻，原是有過很體面的歷史的。唐朝的佛像，明朝的插畫，都是驚人的藝術品，然而，如今我國的木刻，確是西洋的。這種介紹工作最先是在一九二八年的「朝花」週刊上，翻印西洋木刻，其後輯印出版的不下十數種畫集，這些翻印的世界名作，都起了一些導師作用的。因爲一開始在表現的方向上，選擇了正確的道路，不再似油畫水彩和現實的生活脫節，就因爲如此，在這十幾年間，不能否認，曾表現了很多的成績，惹起了國際間藝術界的重視。　　我國新的創作木刻，它總未忘記這應該反映什麼？暴露什麼？它也深知客觀的真實形象，而不允許用「美」來偽飾和美化，因此，木刻藝術它沒有表現「月下洞蕭」，「枯松訪友」或「高山觀瀑」，「麗女浣紗」一套國畫的舊格局；和三個蘋果，一支死鷄或裸女沉思，秦淮春水，那種洋八股，而木刻藝術所提供的內容，則大抵是；乞丐，苦力，死亡，戰鬥和大衆生活相關的東西。木刻在抗戰期間，它表現的是敵人的奸淫燒殺，軍民團結抗戰，保衛祖國；在勝利結束以後，則表現的又是一個階段，恢復交通，難民復員還鄉等。但，在這裏還有一個問題要提一提，藝術它是一種創造，不是將客觀的現實像照像機似的「再現」一次於閱表面前；而是將各種的客觀的事物，那怕是涓涓滴滴，通過了藝術工作者的思維，加以分析和選擇典型，而又具體的「表現」出來，所以，我想，一個真正爲大衆的藝術家，他又該是一個多方面具有經歷，而又最富於想象力的人；那麼他創作的作品，才能够最爲大衆所歡迎。　　木刻藝術在表現的內容上，它不應該脫離週遭的現實生活，而去追求幻想漂渺的美化世界，可應當細心洞察真實的現實生活，來綜合表現它。但，在採取題材上，也不必一定非針對着一種專題不可，表現一件事物，可以正面，斜面象，抽的，具體的，甚至還包括着部分的象徵意味也未始不可，但，只有一點是反映現實而不是美化現實的。讀頑鐵道人傳感賦寄塵　北崙先生正是  田魯叟　　臺島割棄甲午始，祖國追懷料多士；人事闊遠知誰何，五十年來欽有子。子之任俠篤根性，臣僕罔爲抱深恥；蚤懷復響博浪錐，空遺洩恨霄雲矢；百年已畢將母心，壹意乃堅歸國志；豈意寇氛海內偏，已訪客蹤滬濱止。放豚如追冀入笠，好爵爾縻屢遣使；脫身肯再事虜廷，餬口自矢憑薄技；決如千木踰垣避，遑恤鄜生烹鼎死；負隅猛虎敢怒攖，入釜游魚卒逃逝；任教敵國指頑民，或將鐵漢同蜀李；雪霜迄未凋松柏，天日終復見桑梓！試看述志成佳傳，留備采風入敦史。藝術家的痛苦生涯——記法蘭西大畫家P.高更  徐帆　　一九〇三年春天，南洋附近的泰依底（Tahill）島中的一間小茅屋裏，一個赤貧的法蘭西畫家，在孤寂，貧困，與熱帶疾病的侵害中去世，這樣無聲無息的，一直過了幾年，P.高更才被列爲十九世紀偉大的印象派大畫家，再後，莫裳（W.S.Maugham）爲他痛苦的一生寫成一部小說，呌做月亮與六便士（The　moon　and　sixpence），給高更列在藝壇上偉大傳記之中。高更早期生活是一個巴黎的銀行職員，這種單調平淡的生活同他的妻子和一個五歲大的孩子過了十年，到三十五歲，他決定離棄了他的家專門於畫家生活。在他與許多藝術家住在渤黑搭尼（Brittany）的時候，有一天去拜訪梵谷（Van　Cogh），這兩個藝術家爲一個繪畫的理論發生了爭議，當梵谷爭執進入瘋狂時，拿起一把剃刀就要去殺高更。　　爲了許多債負的壓迫，高更公賣了他的畫走向泰依底島探求，當時他四十三歲，在島上租了一間木屋，並與一個十三歲大的毛利姑娘黛鳥黑（Tehoura）同居，她爲他生了一個孩子，並做了許多他的畫的題材。高更畫布上的熱帶境物，洋溢了金色的光亮與丰富的色彩，但當他把它們帶回巴黎時，他是無法使人了解而公賣這些畫的。　　在這時期，高更意外地從叔叔那裏得來一部遺產，使他經濟有一個寬鬆的喘息，他與一位曾在芒特瑪里特黑（Mintmartre）認識的瓜哇女雇用安娜（Anna）同居，他爲自己置了一件長而藍約有真珠鈕扣的外袍，嵌有天藍色絲帶的灰色　帽，一雙白色手套，備着一根手杖，手杖上他曾刻有些野蠻的彫像，他穿着這些服裝與安娜出玩，肩上坐着一隻猴子。有一次，他與一小羣水手起了衝突，擊破了脚踝，當他住到醫院去時，安娜偷了他所有的東西跑了。和着他錢財的竊失，他重離開巴黎，堅決地轉回到泰依底島。　　高更在南洋過渡他心靈與肉身痛苦的最後的日子，他大部份時間生活在番石榴與芒果林裏，他把它們從樹上摘下來作飲食，他的脚患了無法治愈的傳染病，債又欠了一大堆，在絕望裏他走到山谷中準備用砒霜去自殺；他自殺的企圖失敗，他又回到他的小茅屋作全然不可能的破坯。最後，在一九四三年五月八日的早晨，他孤零零的在他的茅屋裏死了。四周堆積着許多燦爛的外來人的圖畫，這些，做成了他死後不朽的榮譽。黑女  法·高更（Gauguin）上海美專世界名畫助學義展出品談月景畫  梁烈亞　　世之繪月景者，大抵與繪畫景無殊，惟於空中烘雲托月耳！不知月下觀物，其物不真，遠尤難辨，雖有月明如畫之說，斯不過用以形容當時之月光分外清明而已，非真若日中之能辨毫髮也。馬遠唐寅湯戴最喜繪月景者，畫中山樹，不獨色澤鮮明，即人物鬚眉亦太明晰，痼弊積習，名家難免，其他可知，惟戴阿鷹所作，可稱庶幾。　　近得讀半千平遠小條，不畫月烘雲，祇見近樹遠山，茅亭泥路，迷濛而淡，光清而輕微，令人覺得此是幽凉淺白之月色境界。引起自然安靜之智慧感；而月之慈祥，人之靈性，均可於尺寸間見之。畫上又題句云：「江邊小路白連沙，路上荒亭映野花，惟許漁郎爲酒舍，長拋明月作人家」。不徒畫可賞，句亦可誦，有所宗仰。藝術生活——記萬錦襄  蔣星煜　　認識錦襄是在去秋一個藝術界的宴會上，到現在爲止，已經整整半年了，這半年來的相處，使我對於她的藝術詣造和人格修養有了基本的理解。　　在國畫方面，錦襄最擅長竹和菊，這是因爲她喜愛修竹的風姿，她喜愛修竹那種瀟灑出塵的風度，她的墨竹，淡淡的幾筆，在有意無意之間，表現出她的天才和功力；至於菊花，這在寒冷的暮秋成長的植物，經歷過崎嶇的生命底道路的錦襄，更對之無限同情，因此常用以爲題材。她的花卉魚鳥洋溢着詩的氣氛和閒適的情調，給予讀者一種自然美的美感。　　錦襄的油畫倒又不僅是畫花卉魚鳥也畫山水，她的故鄉杭州是一個被美麗的湖山環抱着的城市，湖光山色培養了她的藝術的心靈，也啓發了她獻身於藝術的素願，由於素描基礎很好的關係，她的油畫在前輩畫家眼光中所得的評價比國畫更高，她批判地接受了油畫的傳統方法和傳統精神，廣泛地應用了她豐富的生活經騐。　　現在南京的積雪已經消融了，天天是溫暖而耀眼的陽光，我常常陪着錦襄在城郊作短途的遠足，拿着畫箱和三脚櫈在田野裏亂跑，這種生活是很有趣味的。　　她對我說到春假前後，作品就够開一個展覽會了，我渴望着這一個展覽會的揭幕。時間  煜　　聽，時間的脚音！這是一個朝氣充沛的黎明　這是一個生機勃發的初步　起來，中華的兒女們！我們一齊着力　我們一齊耕耘　我們有燃燒不熄的熱忱　我們大家振刷起來　使我們的子孫自力適生　使民族的靈魂永遠清醒　使時代的輪子前進不停　使世界成了快樂的園林　聽，時間的脚音！一寸山河一寸血　187  葉勁風　　「生病大槪就出在這裏？」鶴見好像自言自語着。略略沉吟了一會，這才對我們說，「今天下午，聽了隊長先生的疑問，害怕我們這裏情勢不穩，當時我疑心我們這飯店裏，有敵人方面的特工份子，滲了進來，潛查我們的工作，所以我一進一出，特別留意，也特別小心。到松井部裏，我拿警告口氣，探聽他們，看他們到底注意到我們這座秘密沒有，這一探聽，倒我嚇了一跳…」　　「咱們這兒露了什麼形迹嗎？」耀羣有些躭憂似的。　　「倒不是這個說法，」鶴見瞧着耀羣搖了搖頭，「松井說，他想在今晚一晚，明日一日，要把全北平清理一下。他已經派出了三大組出發，一共二百多人，連西城二龍坑，這個不上眼的偏僻所在，都要去梳理一下。…」　　「據他們的意思，張自忠將軍必在城裏；中國特務的機關，也必在城裏，並且人數不少，並且連日還有活動份子來參加。但他們因要和天津的軍事活動配合起來，一致進行，不願落後，也不願受中國特務工作的掣肘，所以必得下一辣手，清理一下。…」　　「我問他們究竟有綫索沒有，找到確實形迹没有？他们好像很有把握似的，說明天晚到下午十點以前，必定給我一個滿意的報告……這一點，當然有些誇張。不過我所慮到的，就怕我們這裏，被他們下了伏綫。這一點假設被我料到，我們這裏的地位，未免太危險了。」鶴見發表這一段話的時候，眼光完全集中Ｗ君身上；說到危險字樣的當口，却回轉頭來，瞧着耀羣和我。　　幹着我們這一類的工作，何時何地沒有危險？要像鶴見這等顧慮，那還得了？設要顧慮這麼多，我們簡直寸步難移了。可是話又說回頭，這裏危險二字，却是我們指着我們所處另一境地上的定義而說；並非普通解釋。譬如今天我們所定的那三個半步驟，那三個整步驟，從我們的立塲看，並無「危險」；因爲鶴見的單身出伐，他自有自己的保險立塲，一切動作，都在他的特殊掩護之內。　　那第二步動作——突擊——乍看似乎危險，可是危險的焦點，集中在不知敵方的準備，實力，和對我方的觀察上。但這一點，只在鶴見出伐的一番探索，就可明瞭：如其敵方對於我們這裏的秘密很明瞭，對我人的突擊，有充份準備，我們的危險就太大了。否則我們可說一無危險。第三步的危險，那是我們的內在危險，可是我們也慎重考慮過，由Ｗ君和耀羣參加，增强了心靈傳達力量，又由我從旁照料，也可說並無特殊危險。自由談豐子愷訪梅蘭芳  陳志超　　這實在是件值得紀念的軼事。　　三位當代藝術家豐·梅·郎暢談彼此傾慕的心情；假如不爲職務所羈，我一定同去。關於他們會見的情形，只能從豐先生的嘴裏得知一二。　　當豐先生從梅寓回來的時候，慈祥的面孔上堆滿着比平日更多的微笑。我一見他，便搶着問道：「怎麼樣？」他捋着長長的美鬚，笑嘻嘻地對我們說：「很好！很好！」我替他泡了一杯龍井，他於是坐下來，繼續告訴我們說：「梅先生不但人格高尚，而且人也十分和愛可親；他的生活並不像外間謠傳得那麼闊綽。」談到這裏，他點上一支香烟，深深地吸了一口，神情很是得意。看來他對梅先生似乎一見如故。接着他又說他們晤談約有一個鐘頭之久。一個說自己逃難的情形，一個談蓄鬚明志的經過。郎先生却忙着關照他的高足取材拍照。　　我又向他提了些關於平劇的粗淺問題。他說，他對於平劇的注意時間還不很久；可是對平劇的藝術效果却深盼從事工作的同志能加以重視。因爲平劇在國人心目中早已根深蒂固。舉凡唱詞做工，身段，面譜，簡直把人物的性格表達得淋漓盡致。今後如能把劇情中所含封建性的毒素加以廓清，可能會變成一支有力的教育工具。我不待他講完，便又問他：「那麼爲什麼不把平劇拍成電影呢？」他說：「梅先生剛才也和我談起過。據梅先生說，前些日子曾有人向他提議此事，但他沒有答應；因爲平劇的舞台台面不大，所以有一定的台步：假使攝成電影，比方地點是花園，又將怎的開步呢？」　　喝了一口清茶，豐先生接着替梅先生提出一則理論的解釋，說：「平劇是象徵的；電影却全是寫實的。平劇之不能搬上銀幕，道理便是如此，儘管有人嘗試；結果總是吃力不討好。比方平劇裏的開門，用手一動就行；又如騎馬只消一條馬鞭即可，攝成電影那麼又將怎樣？」　　末了，他說平劇不幸爲形式所限，不像圖畫那樣自由，許多許多現代的題材，可說都很難加以利用，而創造出新的劇本。　　這兩位藝術界的前輩，各人都經過漫長的滄桑，仍能健在而竟有會談的一天，真是够興奮的一件軼事呵。自右至左：豐子愷，梅蘭芳，郎靜山打虎二頌  孟龍　　人間之虎，不若獸中之虎，因爲老虎亦有老虎之道。　　虎道是什麼，古人已說過了：仁虎鬥殺於菟；義虎荆溪除暴，禮虎拔刺餽膰，智虎北渡河渠，信虎夜出曉歸。　　可是人間之虎，不談仁，義，禮，智，信，固無庸議，而且貪性如狼，荒淫如猱；喜媚如狐，取巧似猩，陰險似猰，這種「虎而非虎」，却像羣獸之總和，其可憎也如此！　　人間之虎，在內心上是狼，是猱，是狐，是猩，是猰，而一眼看去，外表上不易看出牠的貪性，荒淫，喜媚，取巧，陰險，一下手就取得了千百萬元，殺害了千百萬人。　　收購黃金大戶——人間之虎——官商勾結，狼狽爲奸，是真正的「老虎」，非「打」不可，尤非一網「打」盡，使其不能入山，不能離山不可！　　虎死則人活，誓當以打虎者爲人間之救星，爰作第二次「打虎頌」！圍城的末日——新作讀後感  果華　　一個女人「千方百計」向一個男子的城堡進攻，終於城破投降，男子做了俘虜。這俘虜却又時時反抗，刻刻叛變，鬧得烏烟瘴氣。　　錢鐘書的連載小說「圍城」，在最近一期的文藝復興上面，以極厚的篇幅，給一口登完了。這一期所寫的，就是城破以後俘虜與征服者之間無窮盡的糾纏，而以男女主角大破臉結束。這件事在無數讀者之中，是看得與魯境大會戰或國際外長會議一樣要緊的。　　「圍城」的大部分，不啻一部新儒林外史，而最後一部分又似一齣以小夫婦爲中心的風趣喜劇。顯然作者對於這一對夫婦是偏愛了一點，所以他們的周圍人物，幾乎全諷刺遍了，却祇有他們兩人（以及另一個朋友）沒有刺傷。使讀者對他們也不覺發生了好感。　　整個作品並不注重情節，作者妙筆生花，使每一段拆開來讀都能引人入勝。也由於這個緣故，讀者看到小夫婦破臉結束，彷彿覺得「有餘不盡」，很希望作者繼續寫下去，給這對歡喜冤家一個圓滿的收塲，例如畢竟養了兒子之類，讓讀者也「快樂地嘆一口」氣，而放下書來。　　作者在寫這部小說的時候，雖然很用心，却並沒有想到意識問題。他祗是想寫出一部好小說來罷了。認爲他已經成功了的讀者，想來一定不少，這大槪是謙虛的作者可以自慰的事吧。琺瑯磁的活動房屋  速客　　也許在我們腦子祗知道有所謂活動房屋，而沒有知道活動房屋，最考究的一種「琺瑯磁」造的活動房屋呢！這是在支加哥的一家名叫光明建設公司製造廠所設計造成的。　　假使有五個人同時工作的話，那末不消四小時，這房屋便能安靜地落成了，包括兩大間，和四小間。不過，雖然它的名稱爲琺瑯磁，當然那許多骨架，還是屬於鋼骨的，琺瑯磁差不多全是用來做牆壁頂和地板的。可是，我們所見到的外表，旣都是屬於琺瑯磁，那末，它的名稱自然就被人叫爲「琺瑯磁的活動房屋」了。　　「琺瑯磁的活動房屋」是經濟的，美觀的，而又便利的。安秀麗丹——寫給中國觀衆的信  珠光　　據華納影片公司上海辦事處負責人日前宣佈，他們最近收到安秀麗丹，（華納公司以「唔女郎」著稱於世的大明星），親筆寫給此間中國觀衆與影迷的一封信。　　好萊塢第一流大明星以中國影迷爲對象而寫的親筆信，安秀麗丹實在是空前（雖不能說絕後）的第一人。　　這封信是當着現在好萊塢渡其假期的華納公司中國地區總經理卡浦蘭先生的面而寫的，原函略稱：　　「我非常高興而且驕傲：因爲我的新片「金石盟」即將在你們中國上映。因爲我相信：這是我自認爲比較自滿而且成功的一部片子，同時也是我從一個一般性的演員轉變爲一個性格演員的開始。　　如果這張片子有所成就，那我願意摯誠地奉獻給你們——我的敬愛的中國觀衆們！安秀麗丹（簽字）」　　此間華納公司當局宣佈：爲了遵從安秀麗丹小姐的意志，他們打算在最近期內，把這張近年來華納公司最優秀的心理巨片“King's　Row”已於三月一日舉行一次特別試映，招待本市市長吳國楨曁所屬市府各局官員，以及英，美，法，蘇等四强駐滬外交及領事人員。　　試映之後，該片即將在大光明戲院與本市成千成萬安秀麗丹小姐的影迷們相見。因難見巧　——聯語新話之五  聽松　　對聯有因難見巧者，如相傳之「三才天地人，四詩風雅頌，及琴瑟琵琶八大王，魑魅魍魎四小鬼」等，固獨具巧思，膾炙人口，而張南皮中解元後，每自誇必得鼎甲，有人以鼎甲一二三五字相難者，文襄脫口而出曰，「盤庚上中下，豈非天造地設乎」，然以上各對，所謂强對也，尚有一種絕對，一種極難措詞之對，余在北平，每周必至中央公園，與六七老友叙譚，各舉所聞所知，以資雅謔，然十九皆涉及文藝，致足樂也。　　一日有友述二事，一則極巧，一則極趣，所謂巧者，乃絕對中有天上月圓，人間月半八字，向來無人能對，近皖南一朱姓神童，年十四，值歲首放假，忽謂其父，曰：此非絕對，惟須加七字方可將文義聯貫，自然成對。其聯云：「天上月圓，人間月半，月月月圓剛月半，昨宵年尾，今日年頭，年年年尾接年頭」。蓋屬對之日，適當元旦，收靈機觸發而成此聯，可不謂巧乎。功成不受錄：長揖歸田廬  豐子愷畫「天堂與地獄」  同高　　有一次馬克吐溫被一個婦人問他對於天堂和地獄的意見，他說：「好太太，我一個字也不能說；在這兩處地方都有我的朋友。」過度緊張　——爲生活而加速活動  仲銘　　西都賦裏有一節說道：「內則街衢洞達，閭閻且千，九市開塲，貨別隧分。人不得顧，車不得旋，闐城溢郭，旁流百塵，紅塵四合，烟雲相連。」把都市中熱鬧擁擠的情形，可謂形容監致了。可是都市中緊張的生活，却絲毫沒有說出來。這當然怪不得作者，因爲他看見的是農業社會的都市，不是工業社會的都市，他尤其沒有看見這種時代下的人們爲生活掙扎而加速活動的現象。　　高速度正是都市生活的特徵，任何時候都是千鈞一髮的時機，連一分一秒都不能錯過。然而都市生活又較小城市來得複雜，在謀生的活動以外，還有種種的娛樂和應酬。單是這些娛樂和應酬，就比小城市中整天的生活來得忙碌一些。這果然使都市中人多得到一點享受，然而他們的享受，實在比鄉下人的不享受來得痛苦。這話怎麼說呢？因爲生活太緊張了，所以任何事情，都不能不計算時間，無論看戲，吃飯，甚至談情說愛，都得排定時間，當作一件公事去應付；不如此，就不能維持整個生活的速度。　　然而在這個樣子的生活之下，真正的悠閒足一點都沒有了，而人生的樂趣，更喪失殆盡。西洋人在資本主義社會中高喊「回到自然去，回到自然去」，真正是有感而發的呢！危城記  秦慶鷗　　中華民國卅四年六月十一日　　六月的夜晚，在中國西南這一個瀰漫着極度奢侈氣氛大都市裏，一種含有過多水份的熱浪，打每一所屋子裏把人趕到了街上來，使幾天前已開始發生騷亂的街道上，顯得更像大難臨頭似的。　　省立藝術館雖然位于桂西路的盡頭，而今晚也沒有什麼戲在上演，可是外面那小小的一片廣塲上，也有好幾堆人聚着在談話，在乘凉，甚至在莫名其妙的等待。在藝術館裏面，更是燈火通明，人聲鼎沸，倒像有什麼盛大的宴會在舉行。　　側樓上的幾間辦公室裏，每一張小桌子都拼起來了，拼成三四張不等邊形的大桌子；桌子上滿是花花綠綠的鈔票，偶然還夾着一兩張顏色特別綠得可愛的小票子，那就是瘋魔了每一個中國人的美金票。桌子周圍平均總有五六個人圍着，大家一路在說笑，一路在整理這些鈔票，每個人都累得滿頭大汗，但情緒還是很熱烈。　　履聲橐橐，暢開着門的館長辦公室裏走出了一個身穿陸軍少將制服的中年男子，他在走廊裏　略躊躇了一下，便把臉轉向北面兩間相連的辦公室，睜大着一雙很疲倦的眸子，用一種沙啞的聲音，操着不脫湘音的國語，向屋子裏的人籠統地問：「大約有多少數目」？　　「一百萬怕不到吧」？「六十多萬了」！「支票算進去一百萬可以出關」。…正在點鈔票的那些人零亂地回答。　　「今天有這樣的成績已經不差了」！一個躺在籐椅上休息的人忙着跳起來，下了一個安慰性的結論。他有一個很高的鼻子，和一頭鬈曲的黑髮；身上沒有穿夏威夷衫，而把襯衫的長袖捲到了臂灣以上，底下是一條黃卡其長褲和一雙起了縫裂的白皮鞋。混身有一股藝術家常具底優美的氣度。他的嗓子比那穿軍裝的中年男子還啞，但中年男子是天生的沙啞，他是因爲今天在遊行的時候喊得太上勁，以致暫時失了音。（一）</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen's Resignation Approved, Chairman Temporarily Concurrently Holds Position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Jia'ao Appointed Governor of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Supreme National Defense Council held a temporary meeting at the National Government conference room at 4 PM on the 1st. Chairman Jiang personally presided, with over thirty attendees. The following was approved: (1) The resignation of Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, was approved. (2) The position of Premier of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily concurrently held by Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng of the National Government. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After the news of the Chairman concurrently holding the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan spread, the general reaction was positive. It is believed that past difficulties can now be easily resolved. According to authoritative sources in the government, the Chairman concurrently holding the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan demonstrates the government's determination to reorganize. This is a transitional period. The Chairman values the Executive Yuan and hopes to enter the reorganization phase soon. The current expansion of institutions and establishment of political councils are preliminary steps towards reorganizing the government. The reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the National Government will commence thereafter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Government issued an order on the 1st: (1) Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank, requested to resign, which was approved. (2) Zhang Jia'ao, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, will be appointed to another position and should be relieved of his current post. (3) Zhang Jia'ao is specially appointed as Governor of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Zhang Jia'ao met with reporters on the 1st, he declined to comment on the current financial situation, only making statements about the industrial and mining situation in the Northeast. It is reported that Mr. Zhang will travel to Shanghai in the next few days. He refused to express his views on the situation. Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] According to senior government officials, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, and other ministers will continue to hold their respective positions. Political observers predict that Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province will become the Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Song Ziwen answered questions from legislators in the Legislative Yuan on the 1st, he refused to defend his past policies. However, he denied the accusation in a certain newspaper that his past policies were entirely comprador-like behavior. Song Ziwen, in a sarcastic tone, stated: "Can my past policies of tariff autonomy and abolition of unequal treaties also be called comprador policies?" He did not deny the failure of policies in the meeting, but said that the situation four months ago made it impossible to completely blame him. He said, regarding the country, his conscience is clear, and he does not seek others' understanding. Song's response today was very moving, but he treated the legislators' inquiries with indifference. However, his every word and action revealed his true feelings. When he left the meeting and got into his car, he walked with difficulty and was helped into the car by those around him, looking exhausted, as if he had just recovered from a major illness.</p>
<h3>Premier Song Reports on the Financial Situation in the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier Song attended a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 1st to report on the financial and economic situation. His original speech was as follows:</p>
<p>I originally intended to attend the regular meeting of your esteemed Yuan last week to make a report. However, on February 16th, the National Defense Council passed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, which had to be implemented on the 17th. I had to go to Shanghai to supervise all implementation measures. Therefore, I discussed it with Premier Sun and agreed to report today. I sincerely apologize.</p>
<h3>Three Requests to Resign as Premier of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Today, I can inform you that I have already requested the Chairman to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan three times since last year. Now the Chairman has granted my request, but I am still happy to take this opportunity to report everything to you.</p>
<p>Currently, the general public expresses doubts about the reasons for the current economic crisis. They understand that the current situation is deteriorating due to the military actions of the Communist Party. However, what they cannot understand is that we have experienced civil wars in the past, but never encountered a crisis as severe as the current one.</p>
<p>I feel that this issue is indeed worth studying. At the same time, I believe that to resolve this doubt, we should grasp the core of the issue and examine it. Now, I will briefly describe the past financial situation.</p>
<p>When I was appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank of Guangzhou by the Father of the Nation in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), two banks went out of business. These two banks were the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China when Long Jiguang held power, because its reserves were robbed by him, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank during the Chen Jiongming era, which issued banknotes excessively. Therefore, at that time, the people had no confidence in banknotes at all.</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation saw this situation and knew that financial matters must be handled steadily. Therefore, he instructed that no banknotes should be issued unless there was solid preparation. I have never forgotten this instruction. From the internal rebellion and warfare in Guangdong to the Northern Expedition after the death of the Father of the Nation, even though Guangdong Province was dealing with the wars of the entire warlord army, when the military finance was extremely difficult, the colleagues of the Central Bank never dared to forget the Father of the Nation's instructions. Although the pressure from all sides was heavy and the financial situation was extremely precarious, the Central Bank did not issue a single unreliable banknote because of this.</p>
<p>What effect did such measures have? The banknotes of the Central Bank never discounted even slightly, and for a long time, the value of the banknotes exceeded the value of silver. Therefore, although the wars continued, the financial and economic system of the revolutionary government remained sound and substantial. The profound and far-sighted plans of the Father of the Nation were finally realized.</p>
<p>When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and continued to unify the country, there were still many banks issuing banknotes in North China and Central China. They used silver coins as issuing reserves, so each had its own reserves. Some went bankrupt, and some were able to survive, but each bank could manage itself to some extent. Because excessive issuance of banknotes would result in a bank run, because of this natural restraint, no local government or independent army could ignore the safety level of its issuance. Even if there were occasional bank failures, their impact was limited to the local area.</p>
<h3>Stopping Inflation Requires Peace First</h3>
<p>In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), the United States implemented the Silver Purchase Act, and the price of silver rose accordingly. At the same time, China's silver exports also increased dramatically, and the domestic economic situation was very serious. In order to resolve the crisis, the government abolished the silver standard and switched to the legal tender policy. At this time, silver was rushed abroad for sale, and the foreign exchange fund was used as the reserve standard. I remember very clearly that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross of the British Treasury was the advisor for the implementation of the policy. He once said that the legal tender system is undoubtedly the best system that can be adopted, but the government must be able to restrain itself, because since the cash redemption of banknotes was abolished, the natural limitation on inflation has also disappeared at the same time. For many years, I have never forgotten this advice.</p>
<p>The implementation of the legal tender system started very smoothly. Due to the stability of foreign exchange, foreign trade improved year by year, until the start of the Anti-Japanese War in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937). If the legal tender system had not been used, it is feared that the country would have been difficult to support for the eight-year long Anti-Japanese War. This point should be acknowledged by the public.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the legal tender system, which saved China's wartime finances, contained the root of the national disaster today. When the National Government's expenditure exceeded its income, the only way was to rely on the printing press to make up for it. This caused the greatest harm, because there was reliance without knowing thrift. All parties thought, what does it matter if a little more banknotes are issued? Why not take everything one wants? In this way, inflation increased day by day, and prices soared until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Once the war ended, if the country could achieve peace, inflation could naturally be stopped, because military spending could be reduced, tax revenue could be increased, and at the same time, the sale of enemy property and gold could also increase the country's extra income. Banknotes would no longer need to be issued, and prices could be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Communist Party's Provocations Aim to Destroy the Economic System</h3>
<p>However, the evolution of events was beyond expectations. Due to the provocations of the Communist Party, the country was once again caught in war. Not only could peaceful construction not be achieved, but the destruction was even more severe than during the Anti-Japanese War. The destruction caused by the enemy was mostly caused by war, but the Communist Party's actions were deliberate and unrestrained. Their goal was to destroy the entire economic system, to make the government collapse, in order to seize power by taking advantage of the opportunity. Therefore, they demolished railways, bombed factories, and destroyed mines. At the same time, they established regimes in the occupied areas, opened banks, and issued their own banknotes. The people had long yearned for peace. Now, not only could they not receive the benefits of peace, but they were once again plunged into a war that consumed more than the Anti-Japanese War. The government's income could not be increased as desired, but the costs of repairing transportation and mines increased day by day and could not be suppressed.</p>
<p>The questions I just mentioned from all parties about the current economic situation are a fundamental answer. All previous domestic wars were small compared to the wars we are witnessing now. In the past, wars were battles between two armies, and no one knew that the Communist Party deliberately destroyed all transportation and production, nor did they know that the Communist Party intended to overthrow the current social system. Moreover, more importantly, at that time, there were natural limits to the increase in banknote issuance, but since the implementation of the legal tender policy, this limitation has no longer existed. Therefore, inflation continued, speculation became widespread, interest rates soared, and all economic ills, which you want to ask about today, also came along with it. When I was in the Ministry of Finance, I had a loyal duty to guard the national treasury from a passive perspective. All unnecessary expenditures were resolutely rejected. Now, although I have changed to the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, due to the actual relationship, I am still a critical point in blocking the continuous requests from all parties to increase expenditures, which is no different from before.</p>
<p>Now that the Anti-Japanese War is in the past, after a long period of pain, everyone hopes to get spiritual and material relief and comfort. This kind of mentality is very sympathetic, but the ruthless facts are all there and cannot be ignored. When the Ministry of Finance cannot raise funds, every huge expenditure that needs to be paid becomes a strong dispute with me. Therefore, in order to raise new sources of income, I focused on strengthening the handling of enemy and puppet property and establishing the China Textile Construction Company and other businesses. When receiving and handling enemy and puppet property, there were indeed irregular actions from all parties, but after the establishment of the Executive Yuan's Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Agency, the order of reception gradually recovered. Afterwards, after the joint investigation by the People's Political Council and the Control Yuan, all the malpractices found were completely unrelated to the persons in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Agency. This can be considered a relief! As for the establishment of the China Textile Company, there was a general criticism at the time, and many advocated that the enemy-owned yarn factories should be sold. If this were implemented, it would in fact be equivalent to sacrificing the interests of the entire country in order to enrich a few upstarts. The national treasury would only receive 200 to 300 billion, while the profit of the China Textile Company last year reached more than 400 billion yuan. This year, it may be possible to get a profit of 1 trillion yuan. If the policy of light industry returning to private ownership is implemented and the China Textile Company is valued and sold now, its assets can be sold for 3 to 4 trillion yuan. Therefore, there is no mistake in the establishment of the China Textile Company.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Foreign Exchange Supply Must Be Fully Addressed</h3>
<p>Now the domestic inflation situation is already worrying, and the problem of foreign exchange supply caused by foreign trade must be fully addressed. Exports must be increased and remittances from overseas Chinese must be controlled. Without this, foreign exchange cannot be replenished. Domestic currency and foreign deposits are closely related to each other. If the currency situation deteriorates, it will be even more difficult to obtain foreign exchange. If foreign exchange is not replenished, the impact on domestic currency value and prices will be even more profound. This cause and effect that produces each other is most worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The government's income is extremely limited, but in order to meet the expenditure requirements of all parties, it has to rely on increasing issuance. I am deeply aware that this approach is enough to cause a possible serious situation. Therefore, my colleagues and I are worried about this issue day and night, but all parties always think that I am simply thwarting their will. To endure the accusations from all parties in this way can almost only be regarded as being dominated by fate.</p>
<p>Until today, I still firmly oppose the unnecessary increase in national treasury expenditures. Therefore, I have become like a public enemy. Whenever prices soar, I am cursed. When I believe that the expenses are too large and ask for reconsideration, there are articles in the newspapers saying that everyone else has already agreed, but only the Premier of the Executive Yuan is hindering it.</p>
<p>The current economic crisis is the result of the accumulation of eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the continuous response to the Communist Party's attacks, which has resulted in the national treasury being unable to balance. At the same time, speculation in Shanghai has deepened the serious situation.</p>
<p>Now the government is taking strict economic emergency measures, on the one hand, cracking down on speculation, and on the other hand, trying to restore the trend of balanced income and expenditure, so as to stop inflation. If there are any questions about these measures, the relevant ministers of the Executive Yuan and I are very willing to explain and answer.</p>
<p>The rapid measures to suppress speculation are practically beneficial and effective. We need these urgent measures in order for other long-term measures to take effect. Only in terms of long-term measures can we find fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>In summary, emergency measures are to try to stop paying any unnecessary or deferrable expenses in order to balance income and expenditure. At the same time, public utilities such as postal and telecommunications should be self-sufficient. Taxes should be actively increased. For example, the Ministry of Finance reports that the income tax alone is expected to have an income of 800 billion yuan in the next few months. Enemy property such as the China Textile Company should be accelerated for sale, and surplus materials should be quickly processed.</p>
<h3>The Goldsmith Industry's Petition Delegation Continues to Appeal to the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The goldsmith industry's petition delegation continued to petition the Control Yuan and the National Defense Council on the 1st, requesting the cancellation of the regulations on the time-limited registration, sale, and mandatory exchange for national currency; allowing the operation of receiving, exchanging, processing, and selling gold jewelry, and allowing the industry to apply to the Central Bank for the allocation and sale of raw gold for their needs. They also claimed that if transactions were made at the official price, there would be only outflows and no inflows. The gold inventory of goldsmiths across the country could be sold out in one day, and millions of employees across the country would lose their jobs from now on. Therefore, they decided to insist on the above-mentioned key points and set up a liaison office in Beijing. If necessary, they will petition again.</p>
<h3>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Will Send Representatives to China to Help Our Country Solve the Currency Problem</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has requested Mr. Collado, the US representative to the bank, to go to China to assist the country in solving the inflation problem. Once the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development formally appoints a new president, Mr. Collado will set off for China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy has been formally elected as the President of the World Bank, and will take over the business of 8 billion US dollars of world reconstruction funds on March 17th, succeeding Mr. Meyer, who resigned last year.</p>

<h3>If Measures Are Effectively Implemented, the Crisis May Be Saved</h3>
<p>If these measures can be effectively implemented, I believe the crisis can be saved. In the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), after the Shanghainese army attacked Songhu, various tax revenues suddenly decreased sharply. At that time, the government took decisive measures to balance income and expenditure. This was because at that time, everyone unanimously believed that even in the face of a violent enemy, the most important task was to try to avoid economic bankruptcy. The income and expenditure that year finally reached a balance.</p>
<p>While we are trying our best to reduce expenses, we must also develop production at any cost. Therefore, at the meeting of the United Agricultural Financing Administration Council the day before yesterday, the Chairman instructed that no matter how difficult it is, the amount of agricultural loans must be increased.</p>
<p>In addition, one more thing must be mentioned. Before the war, China's cotton production was sufficient to be self-sufficient. Due to the war with the enemy and the Communist Party, cotton fields were destroyed. This year, we have to purchase 175 million US dollars worth of cotton from the United States to supply the needs of the people's clothing. Now a large number of American cotton seeds have been obtained, and technicians have also been recruited. Agricultural loans have been prepared. We may be able to produce cotton sufficient for three-quarters of our needs next year, while this year, domestic production can only supply one-quarter of our needs. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and the people are diligent. As long as everyone is determined to do their best, the current difficulties are not difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Under the economic crisis, there must be people who do not hesitate to work hard and complain. If it is helpful, then they will not hesitate to be the target of public criticism. My previous actions to curb inflation were purely based on responsibility. I knew it was something that would definitely not be pleasing, but I never intended to be pleasing.</p>
<p>I am also an ordinary person, and naturally I will not be without mistakes. As the saying goes, "To err is human." Therefore, I dare not say that everything I have done is accurate and effective, but it is all for a common and true goal, and there is absolutely no plan for private gain.</p>
<p>Whether this economic crisis can be overcome depends entirely on whether the entire country can have consistent perseverance and support the government's economic emergency measures. Unless the people of the country can truly understand the seriousness of the current situation and can abandon private prejudices and prioritize national interests, I am afraid that no one or any group can achieve the goal of saving the country.</p>
<p>I would like to reiterate the Chairman's recent important reminder, saying, "Now the economic situation in our country has reached a very serious time." The implementation of this Economic Emergency Measures Plan will inevitably cause great pain to our compatriots, but unless we can have firm confidence and strong action, it will be difficult to avoid the Communist Party's plot. The above is a simple report on issues related to finance and economics. If you gentlemen have any questions, please feel free to express them, and I and the responsible officials will answer them separately.</p>
<p>Since I took office as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, I have done my best in everything. There may be mistakes in the policies, but in terms of conscience, when I leave the Executive Yuan, I feel that I am absolutely worthy of the country and the nation. (End)</p>

<h3>The CCP's Nanjing Liaison Office Requests Extension of Withdrawal Period; Shanghai Office Receives Strict Protection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After receiving the government's notice on the 28th requesting assistance in withdrawing before March 5th, Wang Bingnan went to the former Marshall House on the morning of the 1st to ask American personnel to convey to the government a request to extend the deadline for withdrawal by half a month. As of late evening, no response had been received.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan told United Press reporters today that the CCP delegation has requested the Chinese and American governments to extend the deadline for the CCP to withdraw from government-controlled areas by March 5th by fifteen days, so that 170 CCP personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing can make appropriate arrangements before withdrawing to Yan'an. However, it is heard that the American side is unlikely to agree. This deadline was set a month ago, during which the US side is responsible for sending CCP personnel in the government area back to Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After the Songhu Garrison Headquarters notified the Communist Party's Shanghai office to withdraw before March 5th, the CCP office at 107 Sinan Road has been under strict protection since yesterday. CCP personnel are maintaining silence. As of late evening, the Garrison Headquarters has not yet received the list of personnel to be withdrawn from the CCP. It is understood that when the CCP personnel withdraw, some will be sent back to Yan'an by US military aircraft, while the remaining personnel will be sent back to CCP-controlled areas by ship.</p>
<p>Another report states that the Shanghai office of Xinhua Daily on Xikou Road was as quiet as ever yesterday. According to an employee of the office, the Shanghai-based Xinhua Daily personnel had all registered their household registrations, so they did not submit a list to the Garrison Headquarters. As for when and how to withdraw, it depends on the instructions of the CCP delegation in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Gains and Losses of the Gold Standard Policy: Pei Tsu-yi's Report at the Legislative Yuan's Provisional Session</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Pei Tsu-yi reviewed the gains and losses of the Central Bank's implementation of the gold standard policy over the past year at the Legislative Yuan at noon on the 1st, he believed that this policy was effective in stabilizing prices last year, but the situation has changed this year, so it is necessary to carefully consider whether to continue its implementation. Pei first gave a general description of the economic situation in the early days of recovery, stating that at that time, the government was busy with recovery and the national economy had no definite policy. Until the beginning of last year, a market turmoil occurred in Shanghai, and the people hoped that the foreign exchange market could be opened. The government then announced three proposals in late February: "Regulations on Opening the Foreign Exchange Market," "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade," and "Provisional Measures for Central Bank Management of Foreign Exchange," and implemented them on March 4th, deciding to divide imported materials into three categories: non-importable, limited, and unlimited. At that time, in view of the extreme shortage of materials during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the prevention of foreign goods passing through was not strict, but there was absolutely no permission for nylon stockings to be settled in foreign exchange. However, during implementation, there were difficulties due to the excessive number of items on the import list. Therefore, there were thousands of importers and exporters in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, with as many as three or four thousand in Shanghai alone, and it was necessary to adopt a method of division of labor and cooperation, designating some merchants to handle the business. In April and May, the general impression was excellent. Foreign exchange losses were not significant, and government revenue increased more than doubled due to the export of raw materials and the entry of foreign goods. From spring to summer, prices were relatively stable, largely due to the success of the Political Consultative Conference. After July, however, speculative capital increased daily, and external pressure was also heavy. Although the Central Bank had the intention of changing the exchange rate, it still did not dare to act rashly. While it was under consideration, the price of rice suddenly fluctuated again. Due to the grain shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of rice rose sharply. On August 17th, the exchange rate was adjusted to 3350, but merchants were skilled at hoarding and using speculative capital to purchase goods in rural areas. The Central Bank had no choice but to suppress prices with gold. This was the beginning of the government's gold policy. The import of glass handbags and nylon stockings was not due to poor planning, but due to smuggling in Hong Kong. The main reason I (Pei's self-reference) went to Hong Kong last year was to discuss with the Hong Kong authorities how to prevent smuggling. The Governor of Hong Kong had already understood this, but the British government has not yet replied. This was truly unexpected. Foreign exchange also increased daily. In view of this, the authorities revised the import and export regulations a month ago, hoping to reduce foreign exchange losses. After the announcement of the limited quota method, import merchants also began to register. Pei also said that he could reassure everyone present that there was absolutely no favoritism in the import goods approved at that time, and there were no merchants personally known to Tsu-yi among them.</p>
<p>Pei then analyzed the foreign exchange allocation rate last year, pointing out that most of it was the import amount of cotton, with a total of 76 million US dollars. The second was yarn, with 70 million US dollars, followed by tobacco, and then oil, accounting for 52.9 million US dollars. Chemical raw materials were 50.3 million, and metal products were 35 million. Since the implementation of the gold standard policy, prices have inevitably risen, but prices were stable during the three months from March to June, after August, and from September to November last year, which proves that the gold standard policy was not entirely ineffective. However, by the end of the lunar year, due to the New Year's customs, expenditures on all sides were doubled, and the situation suddenly changed drastically. The past effectiveness of the gold standard policy was mainly due to domestic peace. This year, the situation has changed greatly, and whether this policy can continue to be implemented requires detailed consideration. Pei then analyzed the recent gold rush in Shanghai, saying that it was greatly related to the influx of speculative capital from various places into Shanghai, and specifically pointed out that the Shanxi merchants' activities in Shanghai had a very significant impact on the gold rush. Pei answered the questions for half an hour, analyzing them clearly, which moved the listeners. His final conclusion was that after the implementation of the government's new emergency measures, although there was a risk of legal tender being released, China's international trade has not yet reached a balanced state, so there is no reason to be pessimistic about the above phenomenon.</p>
<p>Legislators Raise Questions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan held its fifth provisional meeting at 9:15 a.m. on the 1st, with President Sun as chairman. Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Pei Tsu-yi attended to report on matters. Then, Premier Song began to read the written report on financial and economic measures and explained that he had requested the chairman to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, which had now been approved. After the report, legislators raised questions one after another. Lou Tongsun pointed out that this was the first time Premier Song had attended the Legislative Yuan since taking office, proving that the connection between the executive and legislative branches in the past was insufficient. The Legislative Yuan had already recognized the crisis last summer, but the Executive Yuan failed to discuss it together. After the Shanghai gold rush occurred, the government announced emergency economic measures, but the content was broad, and we urgently want to know how long the implementation will last and what kind of effects can be expected. This plan is equivalent to a test of the entire national economy. How can we guarantee its considerable success? Premier Song has no central policy since taking office, only treating the symptoms. The emergency economic plan is only a temporary solution. We hope that the policy will return to normal. Zhou Yizhi said that Song was very successful in presiding over finance during the Northern Expedition, but now it has plummeted, analyzing it from the perspective of poor planning and raising the issue of credit. Zhong Fude inquired whether there were any errors in the gold policy, whether there was any corruption, and how to stabilize workers' wages. It is also incomprehensible that state-owned enterprises are not allowed to increase prices and are required to be self-sufficient. Zhang Zhaoyuan said: (1) In the past, the government threw out gold to recall legal tender, but now buying gold will release legal tender. With so much speculative capital, it will inevitably hoard and cause prices to rise. (2) Restrictions on the silver and jewelry industry have caused millions of workers across the country to lose their jobs and have implicitly canceled the people's savings methods. (3) Checking gold causes anxiety. Premier Song replied that to stabilize the economy, political stability is the top priority, and said that he has now resigned and does not want to say more, and then left at 10:46 a.m. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu answered the questions raised by the legislators one by one. Then Qian Tianxin inquired about the remaining amount of the 500 million foreign exchange fund, and Chen Guyuan pointed out the resolution of the Second Plenary Session: (1) Increase production, (2) Absorb speculative capital. Today, the government should not compete with the people for profit, but compete with the Communist Party for the hearts of the people. Tradition first, Chen Zifeng and Jian Guansan raised questions about the cost of living for civil servants and educators. Peng Chuntu criticized the Central Bank for making no progress, which Pei Tsu-yi answered in detail. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 p.m.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan has many cases pending review. President Sun declared at the provisional meeting on the 1st: Six more meetings must be held today.

<h3>National Army in Northeast Launches Three-Pronged Attack; Sun Liren and Chen Mingren Go to the Front to Command; Fierce Fighting Outside Dehui Repulses Communist Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, and Chen Mingren, commander of the 71st Army, went to the front to command this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] "Exciting good news will be coming in the next three days," a senior commander here told reporters tonight. He declined to explain the nature and extent of this "good news," but it is generally speculated that it refers to the relief of Dehui and the start of a major battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 28th] The situation in Changchun was stable yesterday and this morning, and the citizens' outlook on the war situation has changed from tense to optimistic. Many citizens gathered at the station, casually observing the National Army getting on and off the train. Cars and horses on Zhongshan Avenue were bustling, and spirited armed troops marched on the road. Commodity prices have ceased to rise.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] The National Army is currently launching a three-pronged attack on the invading Communist troops. The eastern route is advancing rapidly towards Jiutai, and the National Army in the Nong'an area on the western route is pressing towards the Changchun-Harbin Railway. The diamond-shaped area has been compressed. A major battle between the main forces of both sides is about to unfold near Dehui. The artillery fire in Dehui was incessant last night. According to a telegram from the Dehui garrison, the Communist troops have suffered no less than 10,000 casualties in recent days. According to military observers here, the mobilization of the Communist troops invading from Songbei, and the scale of their momentum, is an unprecedented event in the war history of the Northeast Nationalists and Communists. It is no less than the Southern Battle launched by the Communist troops, which previously shook the whole country. Fortunately, the Jilin-Changchun area is well prepared, the National Army's use of troops is miraculous, and the mobilized force has also exceeded the Siping Battle. A fierce battle is imminent. The National Army's actions in the next 24 hours will be the key to the overall situation. If the situation does not change, the main battle between the two sides will unfold in the triangular area between the Changchun-Harbin and Jilin-Changchun lines, and a considerable-scale battle may also occur between the Changchun-Harbin and Changchun-Tao'an lines.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] After the battle situation around Changchun-Jilin and southern Liaoning stabilized, passenger trains on the Changchun-Harbin Railway resumed on the 1st, departing twice from Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 28th] The 359th Brigade, a strong force of the Communist Army that previously fought in Siping, and five divisions, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, as well as more than 30 heavy artillery pieces and tanks and other heavy weapons, launched a full-scale attack on Dehui (80 kilometers from Changchun). Yesterday, the artillery fire rumbled all night. Pan Yukun, commander of the 50th Division of the New First Army guarding Dehui, and deputy commanders Xie Shuhui and Yang Wen, led more than 8,000 troops and fought bravely, inflicting heavy damage on the invading Communist troops. For five days and nights, Dehui is still firmly defended by the 50th Division.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] The battle outside Dehui is fierce. The Communist troops reinforced with 20,000 men and launched a fierce attack on the National Army in the Longwangshan (southwest of Dehui) area on the 27th. The National Army defended strongly. The Communist troops used many heavy artillery pieces to bombard the city. That night, the Communist troops used dense artillery fire to cover the infantry charge. A melee broke out between the two sides, and on the 28th, they were finally repulsed by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Songhua River Bridgehead: Isolated Army Stands Firm and Unharmed</h3>

<h3>Military Joint Defense in the Jurisdictions of the Beiping and Northeast Headquarters Achieves Results; Forces Can Be Used Flexibly in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Regarding the matter, it was said: Due to the arrival of Minister Bai, Xiong Shihui, and Fu Zuoyi in Beiping, the military joint defense in the jurisdictions of the Northeast and Beiping Headquarters has achieved results. In the future, troops will be used flexibly according to the importance and needs of the region.</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi Discusses the Current Situation in Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Fu Zuoyi met with reporters at the Office of the 12th War Zone at 6 p.m. today and answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) The local order in Chahar and Suiyuan is good. All counties have been recovered. Now everyone can speak Mandarin in every county, every road can be traveled, and the Pinghuan Road is fully open. (2) The current serious difficulty in Chahar and Suiyuan is the lack of clothing. The people in northern Chahar have not received new clothes for ten years during the Japanese rule. After the recovery, if we start with promoting cotton, it will be too slow to solve the problem. The provincial government decided to adopt a method of exchanging grain for cloth, that is, the provincial government purchased a large batch of cotton cloth from the Tianjin China Textile Company with the price of military grain, and distributed it to the farmers at the original price, which solved the clothing problem for the farmers who paid grain, simplified the procedures, and avoided the drawbacks of price suppression and non-issuance by grain purchasing personnel. (3) Regarding the spring plowing problem, the livestock losses in Chahar Province after the war were very large. The provincial government decided to concentrate more than 1 billion in agricultural loans of various types to purchase some livestock to expand spring plowing. (4) On the issue of developing western Suiyuan, if the corner of western Suiyuan is fully developed, the food supply in the Beiping and Tianjin area can be completely solved. However, improving Yongli is a key element in this matter. Now UNRRA, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Sui Construction should be working together. It is estimated that after repairing each ferry into a new type of reinforced concrete gate, 10 million mu of fertile land can be irrigated. The required funding is only a few billion yuan. As for the labor shortage problem, consideration has been given to recruiting farmers to go. (5) The construction of the Baotou-Ningxia Railway has been included in the first phase of the five-year construction plan. If it is completed, the grain of western Suiyuan can be transported eastward. The Ping-Sui Railway takes the route of Datong, mainly for transporting coal. Datong's coal production reaches a maximum of 8,000 tons per day, which is of great economic value, so there is no need to change the route. However, the gradient of the ditch near the Great Wall is too high, and the train has to use two locomotives, which is obviously problematic. Therefore, it is planned to change the route to Zhicheng and open a new line directly to the Mentougou area. (6) Regarding the Mongolian issue, there are still Communist troops in Xilin Gol League in northern Chahar, which form a force with the Communist troops in Lindong and Linxi in northern Jehol. The National Army has not yet stationed there. The people of the country must be careful and thorough in dealing with the Inner Mongolia issue and seek a proper solution.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Investigates and Detains Rice Merchants to Punish Hoarding and Profiteering</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st] The Suzhou rice market has recently shown an unprecedentedly miserable scene. Rice shops often refuse to retail, causing panic among the common people.

<h3>Ambassador's Extensive Discussion on Our Overall Situation: Bad Political Practices Must Be Eradicated; Current Efforts Should Focus on People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Office on the 28th] Before flying to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 28th, Ambassador Stuart held his second press conference in Guangzhou, answering various questions. He stated: (1) The current economic crisis in China is firstly an inevitable result of the eight-year war of resistance, and secondly, unfortunately, due to the occurrence of civil war, foreign trade and production are on the verge of stagnation. Therefore, in areas not affected by the civil war, the government and the people must strive for production and construction in order to save this crisis. (2) Regarding the sudden cessation of the withdrawal of American troops from Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places, and the continued arrival of materials to supply the American troops, the Ambassador elaborated on the American position, stating: The cessation of the withdrawal of American troops is due to technical problems such as transportation vessels. The personnel of the Peiping Executive Headquarters will be completely withdrawn in about a month, and the U.S. Marines will be withdrawn as soon as possible, because before the withdrawal, they still have the task of protecting the lives and property of Americans; as for the newly arrived materials, they were actually shipped earlier and only recently arrived. (3) The surplus American materials shipped to China do not include military supplies such as guns and ammunition. As for when the shipment will be completed, it is a technical issue, as there are ships coming from more than seventeen islands in the Pacific. (4) The rumor that he will resign from his position as Ambassador is not true. (5) The trip to Hong Kong and Hainan Island is only to inspect the local American僑 and meet with people in the education and cultural circles; there are also fifteen Americans in Hainan Island. (6) Chinese students' patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of other countries, but they must recognize that China can no longer afford destruction. The nationalism and democracy aspects of the Three Principles of the People have gradually been realized, and current efforts should focus on the livelihood aspect. China's greatest enemies at present are the differences in opinions among parties, the inability to achieve unity and peace, and the existence of bad political practices. Therefore, there must be a reform to eradicate these stains with the spirit of resisting foreign forces in the past, but this task is the most arduous. (7) Whether the U.S. policy toward China will change depends on how the environment changes. However, from the American standpoint, helping all Chinese people is a policy that will never change. (8) Regarding the reorganization of the government, the United States has obtained assurances from the Chinese government that it will expand democracy and improve political weaknesses. As for the participation of various parties, this is an internal Chinese matter and is not convenient to criticize. However, the U.S. government and people all wish China to have a government supported by the people. Therefore, he believes that the people and the media should assist the government to become the most ideal government for the people. (9) He has not heard of the $500 million loan, or the United States may have made this preparation. (10) U.S.-Soviet relations certainly affect China and are also the most important issue in the world, but he believes that the American and Soviet people both love peace, and the United States will do its best to achieve the desire for peace. (11) The Chinese Constitution is certainly legal, but the degree of its implementation depends on whether the people can fulfill their civic obligations, as democratic politics has its advantages and disadvantages. China is now embarking on the initial stage of democratic politics with this new Constitution, giving the people an opportunity unprecedented in history. Therefore, it is hoped that the Chinese people can make contributions to the country and the world.</p>
<h3>A Page of Blood Debt from the Enemy in Zhangzhu, Yixing: A Pit Full of Corpses Unearthed; A Tragic Sight</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Wujin Office] In Zhangzhu, Yixing, there is an open space in the Zhangzhu Middle School, originally the school's back playground. The land is near the highway, and has been unused for many years, resulting in much wilderness. Recently, someone passing by saw wild dogs fighting over food in the field. Upon closer inspection, it was found that the loose soil revealed numerous decaying corpses, causing alarm. They rushed to inform the neighborhood, and people like Ru Gen organized workers to go to the site. Upon removing the loose soil, they were horrified to find a large pit filled with corpses. The clothing was intact, but the bodies were dismembered, scattered, and stained with blood, a tragic sight. Among them were those wearing Western suits and overcoats, and one female corpse that was not completely decomposed, with gold teeth. It was then realized that this was actually a place where the enemy Kou Sugawa unit killed people during their occupation in 1943. When the enemy Kou Sugawa entered Zhangzhu, they stationed enemy soldiers at the Guoshan Academy and the City God Temple (i.e., Zhangzhu Middle School). They built bunkers around the perimeter and strung barbed wire, treating it as a forbidden zone. The people regarded it as a ghostly realm and dared not approach it. It was often heard that they arrested, killed, and tortured our patriotic youths and innocent civilians, but because of the isolation between the inside and outside, and the enemy's secretive actions, it was impossible to find out the details. After the defeat of the Japanese, no one knew that this playground was a slaughter ground, except for the demolition of the fortifications. The excavated remains are estimated to be more than thirty, and they cannot be identified. Local philanthropists have provided coffins and moved the bodies for burial. However, there are still many remains in the pit, and excavation and reburial are continuing.</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Administration Promotes Flight Safety; Plans to Establish "Air Routes" and Strengthen Communication and Sound Meteorological Reporting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Since the Ministry of Communications officially established the Civil Aviation Administration, all sectors have placed great hopes on this new institution. According to reporter inquiries, the Bureau is currently busy planning to promote flight safety, carrying out two aspects: First, expedite the construction of navigation aid equipment. What is being planned is the establishment of air routes, and it is intended to first build 14,000 miles of air routes. The so-called air route is an air line with ground trial assistance equipment. The main equipment is radio navigation instruments, various radio signals, and light signals, so that the driver can hear and see during flight, as if walking on the road. Its determination is to expand and repair airports, and it is planned to first improve international airports and other important domestic airports. The Shanghai airport project has already started, and the Guangzhou airport project has also been planned. In addition, implement air traffic control. Air route traffic control is like traffic police on land. Its role is to limit aircraft from colliding, getting lost, and reducing unnecessary delays, and helping drivers complete safe and orderly flights. The Bureau plans to set up three types of air traffic control agencies: one is the air route traffic control station to assist in controlling and directing flights on the air route; one is the airport traffic control station to control and direct aircraft takeoffs, landings, and taxiing in the airport area, usually within a radius of three miles around the airport.</p>
<p>The Bureau is currently setting up aviation communication stations in airports in various places to handle communication for air traffic control, the transmission of meteorological reports, and the dissemination of flight-related information to pilots, and is closely cooperating with the Central Meteorological Bureau to universally set up meteorological stations to improve meteorological reporting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bureau is strengthening safety management. Aviation safety management, unlike meteorological management, can be divided into three aspects: (1) Personnel management, (2) Equipment management, (3) Management of aircraft work. The Bureau is now expediting the formulation of standards for aviation technicians and aviation equipment, as well as detailed laws and regulations for the certification of aviation technicians and the inspection of aviation equipment. In terms of aircraft work management, inspectors will be dispatched regularly to inspect the aircraft work and repair equipment of various airlines.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Trends in the Political Situation</h3>
<p>Since the close of the National Assembly last year, the attention of people at home and abroad has focused on the reorganization of the government. However, due to the failure to restore peace talks and the hesitation of various parties, the matter has been delayed again and again. It was not until recently that it gradually became concrete. The lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association) have been submitted. Moreover, the lists of various parties participating in the three institutions of the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Political Council have also been approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee. As for the list of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, it is only waiting for the National Government to issue a clear order for its announcement. At the same time, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, when reporting and explaining the government's economic policies to the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning, also announced that he had submitted his resignation and that Chairman Chiang had approved it. Yesterday afternoon, the National Defense Supreme Committee held a temporary meeting and formally approved the decision that Chairman Chiang would temporarily concurrently hold the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. All of this is sufficient to symbolize that the current political situation has undergone new changes.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the primary desire of the entire nation, from top to bottom, was the democratization of politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods. In order to realize political democratization, the government, despite the blatant opposition of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely convened the National Assembly, formulated a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and decided to implement it on December 25th of this year to fulfill its long-standing promise. Now is the transitional period from political tutelage to constitutionalism, and all necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism must be completed during this short transitional period. Therefore, the government is eager to broaden its foundation, recruit representatives from various parties and social elites, participate in various administrative institutions, and actively carry out preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have submitted their lists to participate in the four institutions, it will not be long before they further participate in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. Apart from the Communist Party, which is disrupting the country with its military forces, the willingness of all political parties to jointly promote democracy with the Kuomintang through legitimate means is indeed the most gratifying trend in the current political situation. We firmly believe that there will be a bright day for its realization.</p>
<p>The resignation of Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan this time, although a common occurrence on the political stage, we still feel a variety of emotions regardless. Recalling when Song returned from overseas and took office, the entire nation placed endless hopes on him. But today, Zhu resigned due to the gold note turmoil, which aroused criticism from all sides. On the surface, it seems to have become the "target of public criticism." This stark contrast is unfortunate for Song and also unfortunate for the country. In all fairness, Song is a very confident person, and his administration is quite resolute. In the Chinese officialdom, where perfunctory behavior has become commonplace, he is still considered to have a unique style. Unfortunately, he is too confident and unwilling to listen to different opinions. He is resolute and therefore often stubborn. In addition, the scope of his usual contact is limited to certain people in the economic and financial circles, and he has failed to silently observe the trends of public opinion and the psychology of the people. As a result, the policies he adopted may not be able to address the root causes of the problems. We do not want to judge Song's economic policies based on success or failure today, but his lack of a deep understanding of the most important political maxim, "A state cannot stand without credibility," and his easy destruction of the people's confidence in the government is the root of the problem. Song also frankly admitted that there may have been errors in the past year when he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on economic policies, and he still showed a responsible attitude. What we should pay attention to is not so much Song's resignation, but rather the future style of the government. We believe that the only way out for the political situation in the future is for the government and the people to truly become one. The government must first regard the people as those who can be treated with kindness, as the source of national construction power in the future, and not regard them all as criminals. If those in power can constantly seek advice widely, deeply understand the people's concerns, and formulate any policy with the people in mind, they will naturally gain the trust of the people. Those who are close to the people will be close to them, and those who love the people will be loved by them. Only by gaining the cooperation of the people can the government and the people become one. Then, why worry about any policy being difficult to implement? This is the "world for all" ideal of the Founding Father and the true meaning of democratic politics. No matter how the government is reorganized, or who will actually be in charge of the Executive Yuan, the first priority of the government should be to restore the people's confidence in the government's policies.</p>

<h3>The Balkan Situation Will Have a New Change; Britain Asks the US to Provide Economic Assistance to Greece; Both Sides Are Compromising in Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] A foreign office spokesman announced today that Britain and the United States are discussing in Washington the issue of Britain's extended economic assistance and military obligations to Greece. One of the proposals is to provide further loans so that Greece can purchase arms and military equipment. This discussion stems from the British military's need to fulfill its previous statement to withdraw from Greece on March 31. After the withdrawal of British troops, the United States will not send troops to replace them, and there is unrest in Greece, so precautions must be taken. According to other government sources, Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to postpone the withdrawal date and withdraw the remaining 10,000 British troops from Greece within three months, that is, until the end of May.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] British sources here confirmed that Britain and the United States are exchanging views on the issue of US economic assistance to Greece. British Ambassador Inverchapel submitted a note to Secretary of State Marshall last Monday, explaining the various reasons why Britain cannot continue to bear financial responsibility for Greece after March 31. Although the note did not explicitly state the British military's intention to withdraw from Greece, it pointed out that the British military's presence in the country is a major burden for Britain and cannot be supported indefinitely. The report submitted to the State Department by the US Economic Mission in Greece also matched the British Ambassador's note. The State Department decided that this situation must be explained to congressional leaders, so it invited congressional leaders, including the chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee, to the White House yesterday to explain the importance of this matter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Today, it is rumored that if President Truman decides to take over Britain's economic obligations in Greece and Turkey, congressional leaders will provide assistance, but at the same time, the impact of this move on world stability and the subtle relationship with the Soviet Union must be weighed. Diplomatic and congressional sources said that according to telegrams from London, Britain's domestic economic distress has reached the point of collapse, and it can no longer maintain troops in Greece and provide economic and military assistance to Turkey. When meeting with reporters, President Truman refused to comment on the possibility that the United States would assume all of Britain's obligations in Greece, four times in a row. However, it is heard that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall told leaders of both Democratic and Republican parties in Congress at the White House on the 27th that if the United States does not take this action, Greece may eventually be controlled by the Communists. The two parties' members of Congress listened to the report on the crisis in Greece and reportedly expressed that they would be willing to follow President Truman if he decided that the United States should stand up to maintain the European settlement. However, some Republican members believe that the government should first explain its plan in detail to Congress and the people before making a final decision.</p>
<p>Greece Dissolves Communist Party Organizations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] The "Epon" organization, organized by Communist youth, has been ordered by the authorities to dissolve. The organization has protested to the United Nations Fact-Finding Commission on Greece and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. According to well-informed sources, the government has changed its strategy and is focusing on launching an offensive against the Greek guerrillas. For example, unconfirmed news from the government side has shown that the number of guerrilla deaths and injuries has increased sharply in recent days. The intention may be to undermine the morale of the guerrillas. It is heard that the government's special forces are not yet ready, so they have not attacked the guerrillas, and it is feared that there will be no action before March 15.</p>
<h3>Bevin and Bidault Announce the Conclusion of a Fifty-Year Anglo-French Alliance; The Purpose Is to Prevent Germany from Rising Again to Invade</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The foreign ministers of Britain and France announced in parliament today that the two countries had concluded a fifty-year alliance treaty, which is scheduled to be signed next Tuesday in the historic French port of Dunkirk, where the British army retreated during the early stages of the last war. Britain and France have both concluded mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union, which, although specifically focused on Germany, also express agreement on joint cooperation to maintain European security and improve its economic situation. The announcement of a third type of agreement now completes one ring around Germany. When announced in the British House of Commons and the French National Assembly, members of parliament cheered. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin, this treaty is a clear demonstration of the friendship between Britain and France. French Foreign Minister Bidault's statement ended by mentioning the Anglo-French alliance treaty, but neither Bevin nor Bidault announced the contents of the treaty. The agreement was principally agreed upon a month ago when Blum visited London and spoke with Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons that the Anglo-French alliance will be signed in Dunkirk on Tuesday, March 4. He will meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault in that location while en route to Moscow to sign the alliance treaty. After the two foreign ministers arrive in Moscow, they are expected to guarantee that the alliance is not aimed at any second party. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent expects that the first reaction from the Soviet Union will be an expression of suspicion. Misunderstandings can only be dispelled when it can be concretely proven that the alliance is not the first step in organizing a Western European group.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Anglo-French Alliance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] Regarding the contents of the Anglo-French alliance, it is now known that the key points are as follows: (1) If Germany adopts an aggressive policy, or adopts an attitude that threatens the security of both countries, the nature of the measures to be taken by Britain and France should be negotiated and discussed by both countries; (2) If one of the two countries, Britain or France, goes to war with Germany, the other country should immediately provide all military assistance, regardless of whether the conflict is the result of German armed invasion; (3) If Germany is unable to fulfill its obligations, Britain and France should consult with each other to take all necessary steps; (4) In economic terms, Britain and France should also consult with each other on issues concerning the interests of both parties; (5) The actions to be taken by Britain and France in accordance with the provisions of this alliance must take into account the obligations of both countries to the United Nations Charter in all respects.</p>

<h3>Another Friend of China Weakened: Powell Passes Away in the United States; Collapses Suddenly After Speech Due to Heart Failure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former editor of the China Weekly Review, Powell, passed away suddenly today after giving a speech at a reunion of his classmates at the University of Missouri. In his speech, he predicted that Asia would become increasingly important in international affairs. Powell joked with his friends beforehand, claiming to be an escapee from Walter Reed Hospital, where he had been practicing walking with a prosthetic leg. Powell was arrested by the Japanese army in Shanghai in 1941 and imprisoned for several months, which led to gangrene in both legs, eventually requiring amputation. Powell's death was due to heart disease. Powell collapsed and lost consciousness suddenly after sitting down after his speech. He is survived by his widow and one child each. His son followed in his father's footsteps and is the current editor of the China Weekly Review in Shanghai. Powell said in his final speech: "If the United States has a dispute with the Soviet Union, the war will be in Siberia, not in Europe, because the shortcut is from Alaska across the strait to Siberia."</p>
<p>President Song and Ambassador Koo Send Condolences</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen telegraphed condolences to Mrs. Powell, saying, "The news of Mr. Powell's passing has caused great sorrow to me and my colleagues. We will never forget Mr. Powell's presence in China and his excellent work for China."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wellington Koo telegraphed condolences to Mrs. Powell today, saying that Mr. Powell was not only a good friend of the Chinese people but also strongly supported China during the period of resistance against aggression with unparalleled loyalty and courage. At a time when Sino-American friendship and understanding between the two peoples are becoming increasingly important, the sudden loss of this great friend is deeply mourned by the entire country. Please accept our sincerest condolences.</p>
<h3>Powell's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Data Room</p>
<p>Powell was born in 1886 and graduated from the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in the United States. He came to China in 1917 and served as the editor and publisher of the China Weekly Review, as well as a special correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, the Manchester Guardian, and other newspapers, reporting on the situation in China, which was highly valued by the international public opinion. The Chinese government awarded him a medal in 1923. Powell ran the China Weekly Review for a long time. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he repeatedly exposed and criticized the Japanese military's aggression and barbaric behavior, causing hatred from the Japanese side. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained in a concentration camp and suffered abuse. After being released after the victory, he returned to the United States for recuperation, but his health had been destroyed, and his legs were half paralyzed, making it difficult for him to walk. Last year, at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals, Powell went to Tokyo despite his illness to testify. Afterward, he originally planned to come to Shanghai for a visit to meet old friends, but due to physical discomfort, he followed his doctor's advice and returned to the United States for treatment, and both feet were amputated. Recently, Powell's health had greatly recovered, and he had repeatedly expressed his strong desire to come to China again, but unexpectedly passed away suddenly the day before yesterday after giving a speech at a reunion of his classmates at the University of Missouri.</p>
<h3>During the Allied Council for Japan, Zhu Shimin Will Raise Questions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Allied Council for Japan is scheduled to hold its 27th regular meeting on March 5. Chinese representative Zhu Shimin is prepared to raise twelve questions for discussion, all related to the repatriation and demobilization of Japanese troops, and request MacArthur to answer them. Observers believe that Zhu's questions seem to imply that MacArthur has paid little attention to the various proposals of the Allied Council in the past. Other representatives of the Allied Council have also repeatedly made this accusation, but it is of an informal nature.</p>
<h3>Conservative Forces Strong in Japanese Local Elections</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 1st] The number of candidates applying for qualification as governors of Japanese prefectures and municipalities has reached ten times the quota of forty-six. Looking at the overall situation, conservative forces are still strong in local elections. In the Tokyo mayoral election, Tagawa Daikichiro, the incumbent member of the House of Representatives recommended by the Socialist Party, and Yasui, the incumbent mayor jointly recommended by the Liberal and Progressive parties, are the most promising. At present, the Socialist and Communist parties are quite united and can threaten the conservative camp. The question is how the Liberal and Progressive parties will cooperate in the future.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, which opened on March 1, "The International Monetary Fund" is now receiving funds from member countries, so that countries that need the fund to help pay for imports in the future can draw on it. This international exchange work, which was originally a major part of the fund's plan to stabilize world currencies, is scheduled to begin on March 1.</p>
<p>By then, at least thirty-two of the fund's thirty-nine members will have paid their assigned gold and national currencies, and from then on, they will be able to purchase foreign currencies when needed to avoid temporary foreign exchange difficulties.</p>
<p>The first step in the implementation of the plan was for the Fund's Managing Director, Camille Gutt, to set the initial prices of the currencies of thirty-two countries, and after that, the initial exchange rates could not be changed unless adjustments were necessary due to major difficulties in their foreign trade situation. All initial parities are based on current exchange rates.</p>
<p>The other seven countries and two colonies—Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies—were given time for the fund's management to deliberate at length before determining the initial parity of their currencies because currency or reconstruction problems remained to be resolved.</p>
<p>Countries whose parities have not yet been determined will be allowed to delay payment of their assigned funds. Therefore, the fund will only have $6.525 billion in funds at the beginning. When all thirty-nine countries participate, the capital will increase to $7.57 billion. In addition, four new member countries have been allowed to join, namely Italy, Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. After their payments are added, the total will reach $7.7 billion.</p>
<p>The fund is a new experiment in international exchange. It and the World Bank are sister institutions that originated from the monetary conference held in Bretton Woods in 1944. The bank's task is to provide member countries with long-term credit loans; the fund is to meet short-term needs in exchange, namely to maintain the stability of currency values and to provide countries with the currencies needed for foreign trade, and to assume responsibility for the mutual free exchange of currencies. Currency planners believe this is a necessary condition for the reconstruction of world trade. Now that the fund is about to start working, it is important to understand the details of how this institution works.</p>
<p>Supporting the fund is gold and the currencies of member countries. The amount of each country's subscription was determined at the Bretton Woods Conference. Each member country agreed to pay a portion in gold, with the remainder paid in its own currency. It is estimated that after the original thirty-nine countries deliver their subscriptions, the total amount of gold and US dollars supporting the fund will be $3.6 billion. The US portion is $687.5 million in gold and $2.625 billion in US dollars. The US subscription totals $2.75 billion, accounting for 37% of the fund's capital. The other thirty-eight countries should pay $850 million in gold and their currencies worth $3.87 billion in US dollars.</p>
<p>The countries with the next largest subscriptions are the United Kingdom, with $1.3 billion in gold and British pounds; China, with $550 million in gold and legal tender; France, with $525 million in gold and francs; and India, with $400 million in gold and rupees. France's original subscription was $450 million, but the Fund's Board of Directors increased it to the current amount at France's request. It made this request to increase its power to withdraw from the fund in the future.</p>
<p>Currency values will be gradually adjusted over a long period of time. At the beginning, the fund will use current exchange rates as the standard, but it is stated that the parities of some currencies will be adjusted later. This is so that the US dollar can make the values of the currencies of various countries match each other, so that no country will be able to take advantage of the trade by artificially inflating or deflating its currency.</p>
<p>Member countries agree to maintain the initial statutory parity before changing the value in accordance with the terms of the Fund's agreement. The fund has established this barrier in order to prevent currency wars. Competing to gain export benefits through devaluation is a reason that caused extreme currency fluctuations in the past, and it has now been agreed by all countries to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Many currency controls that protect their foreign currency reserves will also be gradually eliminated. The fund recognizes that countries weakened by the war, such as France, need to impose some controls on citizens who use US dollars to purchase goods in the future. At the same time, France and other member countries agree to ease these restrictions to the extent possible. The time limit given to France to lift controls is five years. If it fails, it will lose the right to withdraw funds from the fund, and in this case, it may eventually lose its membership.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the currency sold by the fund may all be US dollars. This currency is most needed by member countries, because the United States is the main supplier in the world. The following situation can be used as an example: France needs more US dollars to buy American goods than it has in its possession. It can apply to the fund for $131.25 million, which is one-quarter of France's allotment and the maximum amount it can purchase in one year. The fund determines that it has the ability to repay and that the use of the US dollars is appropriate, and approves the application.</p>
<p>France must pay in the same amount of francs for the US dollars it receives. The exchange rate is based on the statutory parity of the two currencies set by the fund. France agrees to repay quickly to the extent possible and will take back the francs after repayment. At the same time, France needs to pay the fund a handling fee and interest. A handling fee of 0.75% is paid immediately. Interest is then paid at 0.5% starting after three months, gradually increasing to 4% after four years and 5% after ten years. Therefore, France needs to quickly offer French goods to the United States in order to repay the loan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Fund's agreement strictly limits changes in currency values. However, it recognizes that some initial rates do not represent true values, and the value of some currencies can fluctuate several times before a suitable benchmark is found. Adjustments will go through the following process: Suppose France later finds that the initial statutory parity of the franc—119 to one US dollar—is too high, which is not conducive to it selling goods at French prices to foreign countries. French prices can be reduced, but this may cause a domestic recession. Therefore, France depreciates the franc by 10% and notifies the fund. A 10% devaluation does not require the consent of the fund.</p>
<p>But suppose the price of the franc is still too high. Then, another devaluation must obtain the consent of the fund, and the fund will only approve it if a cheap franc is necessary to maintain the country's foreign trade position.</p>
<p>Therefore, changes exceeding 10% are within the scope of international control, and it is generally believed that this can prevent any unnecessary changes. The opposite of this situation is the unrestricted fluctuations in the past. The French franc went from 3.92 cents per US dollar in 1929 to 5.3 cents in 1933, then to 6.6 cents in 1935, and then fell to 4.5 cents in 1937, 2.88 cents in 1938, 2.08 cents in 1940, 1.97 cents in 1945, and finally 0.839 cents in 1946.</p>
<p>Stabilizing world trade is the ultimate goal of the currency plan. Suppose, taking France as an example, it has a bad wine harvest one year. If it cannot sell wine to the United States, it will temporarily lack the funds to buy the American goods it needs. This will affect the trade situation between France and the United States. Therefore, in order to overcome this difficulty, France can go to the fund to obtain the US dollars it needs.</p>
<p>The danger of US dollars flowing out of the fund in a constant stream is what it will encounter from the beginning. Therefore, it must refuse member countries' arbitrary extensions of borrowing power and insist on carefully reviewing the applicant's purpose and ability to repay. The task that the fund shoulders is extremely large. Its success depends not only on the fund's own efforts, but also on whether member countries can solve domestic monetary and production difficulties. A stable world currency system is not achieved overnight. (US Information Service)</p>
<h3>Korea Commemorates Independence Day; Domestic and Foreign Opposition to Trusteeship Demands Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 1st] Today is Korean Independence Day, and a curfew will be implemented throughout the country. Judging from past experience, today is often a day for riots and even revolutions. US intelligence personnel have discovered plans for Koreans to riot around March 1, so unrest may still be unavoidable today. The commander of US forces in South Korea has ordered increased vigilance and issued a warning, pointing out that malicious riots would only harm the good intentions of those who care about Korea and would make the latter believe that Korea may not yet be suitable for independence since the Korean people are unwilling to cooperate with the institutions preparing for Korean independence. At the same time, propaganda against trusteeship is still emerging endlessly both inside and outside Korea. Right-wing leaders still insist on implementing the three-point plan they passed on January 14, namely: (1) Oppose the provisions of the Moscow Declaration on trusteeship of Korea; (2) Organize a national Korean independence movement; (3) Send a delegation to the United States and the Soviet Union to demand immediate independence. The right-wing group also launched a request for General MacArthur to review the Korean situation, and several parties have expressed support for this request. However, both the left and right wings have great hope for the Moscow Conference, hoping that the Korean issue will at least be partially resolved.</p>

<h3>Doubts Cleared Regarding Differential Subsidies for Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Many Disputes Arise with Manufacturers Regarding Salary Payments</p>
<p>Details to be Discussed Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the February cost of living index was frozen and a subsidy of 73,000 yuan was introduced, many manufacturers encountered disputes when paying salaries yesterday and sent telegrams to the Social Affairs Bureau for clarification. The bureau provided answers to each, categorized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Is the subsidy of 73,000 yuan also applicable to child laborers? Answer: The types and quantities of daily necessities supplied to employees are calculated based on a family of three. Child laborers do not have wives, children, or family burdens, so the calculation is based on one-third. If meals are provided, the difference in the subsidy for rice, coal briquettes, oil, salt, and sugar must be deducted, and only the cotton cloth item is provided.</p>
<p>(2) Is there also a subsidy for overtime wages in addition to the regular wages? Answer: No.</p>
<p>(3) How is the differential subsidy calculated and paid for those who take leave? Answer: If the leave is approved by the factory, the subsidy will be paid as usual. If it is absenteeism, there will be no subsidy.</p>
<p>(4) How is the differential subsidy paid to employees who are paid by piecework? Answer: Calculated proportionally.</p>
<p>(5) How is the differential subsidy paid to those who are paid on a daily basis? Answer: Calculated and allocated proportionally.</p>
<p>(6) In this differential subsidy, rice is calculated at eight dou. How will this be handled for those who already have a rice subsidy? Answer: If there is already a rice subsidy equivalent to five dou of rice outside of the salary, then in February, in addition to the original subsidy, the difference for the eight dou of rice will be converted into cash, calculated as three dou. The differential subsidies for other items such as oil, coal briquettes, sugar, cloth, and salt will be paid as usual.</p>
<p>In summary, the Social Affairs Bureau has stipulated one principle: all salaries calculated on a monthly basis will be paid according to 73,000 yuan. The details will be discussed at the labor-management adjudication meeting to be held tomorrow.</p>

<h3>General Labor Union Discusses Index Issues, Hopes for Adjustment Every Three Months</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal General Labor Union held a board meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the union. The meeting discussed the issue of workers in various districts and industries demanding the unfreezing of the cost of living index. There was enthusiastic participation and heated discussion. It was generally believed that the government's freezing of the cost of living index, while failing to effectively curb prices, has severely impacted the lives of workers. This is due to the government's failure to fully understand the actual living conditions of workers in Shanghai, and it is regrettable that the labor community was not consulted beforehand. However, considering the serious economic difficulties currently facing the government, the emergency economic measures of the government are reluctantly accepted for the time being. However, it is hoped that the cost of living index will be adjusted every three months in the future (for example, April salaries will be paid according to the March cost of living index) in order to alleviate the long-term suffering of workers.</p>
<p>[Another News Item] Regarding the employment problem of unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from the rear, the union has decided to organize a committee to discuss solutions.</p>

Mr. Pan stated: "I am very pleased to participate in the Korean Revolution Commemoration Meeting in my dual capacity as a representative of the Municipal Council and Secretary-General of the Sino-Korean Cultural Association. During the Cairo Conference, China strongly advocated that Korea should be granted independence. Although this proposal was supported by the Allied countries, it has not been realized to this day, which is regrettable. Although China has won victory, the people are still in dire straits due to the instigation of a few ambitious elements. We should work closely together, strive for survival, and continuously strive for democracy and freedom."</p>

<h3>Retrial of Li Ze Case</h3>
<p>Reopening of the Investigation Hearing</p>
<p>Claimed to Have Received Approval from the Military Intelligence Bureau for Serving as Director of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Li Ze, General Manager of the New World Company, accused of being a traitor, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the High Court on June 8th last year. Li appealed the verdict, and the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. Yesterday was the reopening of the investigation after the retrial of the Li case, and witness Huang Naotang was summoned. Li Ze wore glasses, a dark gray silk floss robe, and black Zhigong Ni Hankou shoes, with a plump complexion and calm demeanor. Many employees of the New World Company were present in the audience, but the original informants, Shu Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, were not seen. Yesterday's High Court hearing was quite simple, focusing on the following two matters: (1) Why was the Japanese national Kinoshita Yutaka hired as a consultant to the New World Company? (2) Why did he participate in the Puppet Association for Business Coordination and serve as a director? Li Ze stated: (1) Because after the Japanese army occupied the concession, the environment was harsh, and Japanese ruffians often harassed the New World Company. The Japanese even planned to invest in and buy the New World Company. In order to avoid this crisis, with the approval of the company's board of directors, Kinoshita Yutaka, a Japanese national who had just arrived in Shanghai, was hired as a consultant to deal with various troubles from the Japanese army. This point has been proven by the chairman of the board, Jin Zongcheng, in court. (2) Regarding serving as a director of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination, he consulted with Huang Ruitang, a liaison officer of the Military Intelligence Bureau, who requested instructions from the Military Intelligence Bureau to allow him to join the puppet organization in order to provide cover for conducting underground work. After participating in the association, he never made any speeches or proposals, which can be verified by consulting the records of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination. The Military Intelligence Bureau has records of my contact with the bureau before the victory. Witness Huang Ruitang, an employee of the Military Intelligence Bureau, was unable to appear in court to testify due to going to Hong Kong. The court adjourned the case for further hearing, and the defendant was allowed to see his family before being returned to the Zhongjian Prison.</p>
<h3>Descendant of Prince Gong, Sheng Yudu, Prosecuted for Colluding with the Enemy</h3>

On November 2nd of last year, he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command, transferred to Shanghai Prison, and detained in Zhongjian Prison. After the High Procuratorate completed its investigation, he was prosecuted on suspicion of treason.</p>
<p>Wang Boyong, Tang Weijun, Pan Guangshan, Shi Hua (also known as Shi Binliang), Weng Yongqing, Zhang Hexiang, Sun Boping, Song Zhen, and others have also been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of treason.</p>
<h3>Zhong Zhiying Suspected of Aiding the Enemy, Chen Songyao Accused of Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhong Zhiying's case, accused of treason, was heard in the High Court yesterday. Zhong once opened the China Building Materials Company. During the fall of Shanghai, he sold a large amount of galvanized iron to the Central China Real Estate Department of the Japanese Revival Corporation and colluded with the Japanese army to purchase materials on their behalf. He was reported by his cousin Huang Shaotang, who testified in court yesterday about the defendant's actions in aiding the enemy in great detail. After questioning, the court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. Chen Songyao, accused of serving as a major staff officer in the Puppet General Staff Headquarters, director of the Puppet 13th Division's Beijing Office, chief of the document section of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and chief of the first section of the Puppet Chuansha County Government, was interrogated by the High Court yesterday and adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Fabric Sale Bribery Case Yesterday: Defendants and Witnesses Questioned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Court held its third hearing yesterday afternoon for the fabric sale bribery case involving the Municipal Property Management Office. Defendants Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao, as well as witnesses Zheng Jing and Zhuo Qingbao, were summoned to court. According to the first defendant, Pan Shufan, he served as the deputy director of the Municipal Property Management Office and resigned in May last year, succeeded by Xie Haoling. Although the municipal government did not send personnel to supervise the bidding for cotton fabric, police personnel were present. According to the second defendant, Xu Jingbo, he served as the director of the Police Welfare Committee. His motive for purchasing 1,000 bolts of cotton fabric from the winning fabric merchant after the Municipal Property Management Office sold the cotton fabric was that the General Affairs Office used public funds to purchase them. First, a promissory note was paid to Rongmao Fabric Shop, and then a check was exchanged. The price of the purchased fabric later fell, resulting in a total loss of six million yuan, which was recorded in the public accounts. The third defendant, Liao Gongshao, testified that he served as the director of the General Affairs Office of the Police Bureau. The purchase of cotton fabric was indeed advocated by the General Affairs Office, but the purpose was to seek welfare for all and was approved by the director. Judge Huang Guangyu questioned the three defendants and then questioned witness Zheng Jing, who was the accounting director of the Police Bureau. He claimed that he did not know whether there were any difficulties in Rongmao's extraction of the fabric after winning the bid. Because someone objected after the fabric payment was made, it was not reimbursed. Another witness, Zhuo Qingbao, the former director of the Xincheng Branch Bureau and welfare committee member, testified that he did not know about the purchase of fabric in advance. According to the market situation at the time, the price of fabric might have risen, but it later fell, so this batch of cotton fabric suffered a significant loss. In conclusion, the court stated that witnesses Li Jia Zhou and Chen Shao Ying were not present and would be re-summoned at a later date.</p>
<h3>Enemy Yasuda Terutada's Trial Concluded, Admits Unreservedly to Receiving Military Rice</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yasuda Terutada, a military officer of the Japanese Gendarmerie stationed in Songjiang during the period of the occupation, led puppet military police units to Huangqiao Township in the county to forcibly collect military rice during his tenure.

<h3>Investigation Report on the Major Fire Case</h3>
<p>District Prosecutor's Office Has Not Yet Received It</p>
<p>Another Telegram Sent to the Municipal Government Yesterday to Urge Inquiry</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the sensational Ximolu major fire case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, except for the arsonist Shen Qiulin, who has been prosecuted by the prosecutor, the part of the case involving the dereliction of duty by firefighters has not been investigated because the municipal government has not yet sent the investigation report to the prosecutor's office. The prosecuting attorney, Shen Zushou, believes that the suspected firefighters have been detained for a long time, and all sectors of society are paying close attention to the case. Although two official letters have been sent to the municipal government to urge inquiry, no reply has been received. Therefore, he sent another telegram to the municipal government yesterday, requesting that the investigation process be sent to the office as soon as possible for investigation.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Fees in This City to be Collected According to the New Standard</h3>

<h3>Mayor Discusses Feelings After President Song's Resignation</h3>
<p>China Has Three Difficult Positions, Resigning is a Blessing</p>
<p>Strongly Denies Being Transferred to the Position of Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the news of President Song's resignation reached Shanghai, the reporter paid a special visit to Mayor Wu last night to inquire about his feelings. According to Mayor Wu, he received the news only a few hours earlier than the general public. When he asked President Song for instructions on adjusting the price of flour yesterday afternoon, President Song told him, "I have resigned." Mayor Wu believes that President Song's resignation being approved is "a blessing" because the position of President of the Executive Yuan is not easy to hold these days. Mayor Wu also stated that he had visited Zhang Qun in Nanjing, and Zhang mentioned whether there were rumors in Shanghai about him taking over the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Mayor Wu replied, "I hope these are just rumors, as it would be a blessing for you."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked if there might be any changes in the municipal government after President Song's resignation. The Mayor replied, "I don't know." He added, "Personally, being able to leave Shanghai a day earlier is fortunate." Before the Lunar New Year last year, he had submitted his resignation to the central government, but it was not approved. He then took a step back and requested a one-month leave of absence for rest, but because the environment in Shanghai is complex and unexpected events are difficult to prevent, it was difficult to take leave. Mayor Wu repeatedly showed the reporter his white hair, stating that the Nanjing authorities unanimously recognize that China has three difficult positions: Chairman of the National Government, President of the Executive Yuan, and Mayor of Shanghai. The reporter further asked whether the widespread rumors that Mayor Wu would take over as Minister of Foreign Affairs were true. Mayor Wu strongly denied this, stating that he was least interested in diplomatic work. He believed that Chairman Chiang understood this and would definitely not assign him to do it. He added that he is usually straightforward and frank, with a bold nature. A Minister of Foreign Affairs must be scheming in every word and action, considering everything before and after, which he could not possibly handle.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Electric Company Demands Return of Confiscated Generators</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to demand the return of the complete set of its power generation equipment, which was forcibly moved by the enemy to the North China Iron and Steel Company in Beiping and the Shentou Power Plant in Boshan, Shandong, during the war, in order to alleviate the power shortage in Nanshi, the China Merchants Electric Company hosted the press at 3:00 PM yesterday at the site of the factory on Chezhan Road. Huang Bingquan, the manager of the company, reported on the situation and led a tour of the site where the generators had been dismantled, requesting that the press uphold justice and appeal on their behalf so that the company's generators could be returned and used for power generation in Shanghai as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the company sent personnel to investigate the dismantled equipment and learned that it is still in good condition. Two sets of generators with a capacity of 6,400 kilowatts and 3,200 kilowatts, respectively, were moved by the enemy to Shijingshan in Beiping and are now in the custody of the North China Iron and Steel Company, which is managed by the Resources Committee, and have not been used. Another set of 6,400-kilowatt power generation equipment was moved to the Shentou Power Plant in Boshan, Shandong, and is managed by the Zibo Iron and Steel Company of the Resources Committee. The company has been negotiating with the Resources Committee, and official documents have been exchanged for half a year, but it has not yet been returned.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang also stated that the 4,000-kilowatt generator of the British-owned Lunchang Yarn Factory was moved by the enemy to Anshan in Anshan, and President Song has approved its return. Why is the privately-owned China Merchants Electric Company being treated differently? He couldn't help but feel emotional.</p>

<p>Waking from a Nightmare: Chahar Enters a New Direction</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 16th – Quick Report from Our Chahar Correspondent, Jie Zhong</p>
<p>Devastation from the war has left the province severely wounded, disordered and broken. Everywhere one looks there are things to heal. Like a spiderweb after a storm, there are countless loose ends and flaws everywhere. Society needs to recover in stability, and the people need to breathe in stability. The desire for politics exceeds the weight of military matters. Only good politics can guarantee the achievements of the military and solve the people’s livelihood. Since the National Army entered Zhangyuan four months ago, they have been busy with military suppression and restoring order. Although administrative institutions at all levels have been established, staffing and funding have not yet been fully implemented. Today, Chahar’s politics is just beginning, and it is also undergoing its first test. Faced with a reality stained with blood and tears, there is a special need for decisiveness, resolve, and grasping key points in politics. It is said that General Fu Zuoyi is not only an outstanding general but also possesses excellent political talent. He has methods for governing the army and managing politics. He left behind great achievements during his eighteen years in Suiyuan. His military achievements have formed a stabilizing force on the frontier. Now, with firm steps, magnificent courage, and full of optimistic confidence, he takes on the arduous and difficult task of repairing a broken land, aiming to make Chahar a solid national defense and a paradise for the people.</p>
<p>Democracy First, People First</p>
<p>I remember at a tea party, reporters praised General Fu's achievements. General Fu humbly said, "I am a simple person from the countryside and do not have any special abilities. Everything I do is according to the will of the people." He pointed out that the victories in Sui, Bao, Ji, Ning, and Zhangyuan were victories of the people's will. "In the era of democracy, the people come first." Everything is for the people and for the soldiers. Perhaps this is the main condition for his success. He understands the hardships of the people, the lives of the soldiers, and knows all the cadres as well as he knows his own family. He knows what the people hope for and, even more, knows how to satisfy the people’s hopes. He has proposed that the central task of Chahar Province's politics at present is "Stability First, Production Paramount," starting with "Clean and Competent Politics."</p>
<p>Talent to the Countryside, Funds to the Countryside</p>
<p>Stability is the guarantee of production and the prerequisite for all political implementation. Stability is not just military suppression, and pacification work is only an important part. In particular, it is necessary to implement democratic politics. General Fu always puts the interests of the people first. In a democratic era, sovereignty belongs to the people, and benefits belong to the people. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the people be aroused, and politics will have strength. The people respect and trust him in the same way because he loves the people so much.</p>
<p>Organizing such a complex and difficult environment requires leadership and concentration of power. During the eight years of the War of Resistance in western Suiyuan, General Fu utilized the unified leadership of the Party, government, military, and youth corps, which had a great effect. The integration of military affairs, government, officials, and the people is the source of strength. Today, Chahar Province is still benefiting from this in its recovery. The administrative lineup of Chahar Province is quite strong, and cadres at all levels are full of youthful vigor, tense, active, and willing to take risks and overcome difficulties. They have struggled in adversity and grown in hardship. Work and struggle are closely linked. Jia Zizun, the magistrate of Longguan County, died in office; Xu Shuren, the magistrate of Kangbao County, cleverly repelled the enemy; both stories have become exemplary tales. Currently, to improve the county and township organizations, they are mobilizing "Talent to the Countryside, Funds to the Countryside" to strengthen the foundation.</p>
<p>Excellent Tradition, Hardworking Style</p>
<p>General Fu often instructed his subordinates, "It is not easy to be a nation-building cadre. During nation-building, the people expect future results from officials, not rewards for the past. The people already believe that the Three Principles of the People are the guiding principles for nation-building, but the people have the right to choose those who implement these principles. Churchill and de Gaulle were both figures with outstanding achievements for Britain and France, but they both failed in the elections after the war. Whether we can get the support of the people depends on whether we can show something for the welfare of the people." "The greatest enemy of politics during nation-building is corruption. Therefore, we must especially implement 'Clean and Competent Politics.' The manifestation of cleanliness is hard work, and the manifestation of competence is active work. We must use hard work and struggle to create a good environment and improve the people's lives." His actions provide strong guarantees for his words. A hardworking style is an excellent tradition in this region. The consistent lifestyle of officers and soldiers, officials and the people has saved the country countless materials and rescued countless cadres. The production of the eighteenth century should never be used for the enjoyment of the twentieth century. Therefore, he strictly requires cadres, "The standard of living cannot exceed the salary. The salary and living standards do not have to be completely consistent. We want to generally improve the living standards of the masses, rather than just seeing the affluent lives of a few individuals." All of this starts from oneself and is consistent internally and externally. Here, cadres can work with peace of mind and strive actively, which is probably due to the success of the leaders.</p>
<p>Government Confidence, People's Expectations</p>
<p>Pacification work is the first lesson of politics. To stabilize a place, it is necessary to have strict household registration and a thorough investigation of the population. "This year, we must ensure that every person is registered under a household, and every household is registered under a district, so that no bad person can hide, and no rumor can spread. After strict investigation and statistics, the whole province has formed 3,303 districts and 28,732 neighborhoods within the areas controlled by the National Army, with a population of 1,937,394, including 1,046,456 men and 234,443 able-bodied men. We also utilize the people's enthusiasm for self-defense, exerting self-defense capabilities through self-defense organizations to achieve the completion of self-defense." Yes, consolidating security needs to be built on the foundation of the people's strength.</p>
<p>The people's representative institutions in each county will be established soon. The elections for the county councils will be held in mid-April. We hope that "Democracy" is not just a signboard or a slogan. Give civil rights to the people, and let democracy become action. "Under truly representative people's institutions, government orders will be implemented more effectively from top to bottom with the assistance of the people's institutions, and public opinion will be reflected from the bottom up for the government to adopt and implement, so that the government serves the people, and the people are the government's support." This is the government's confidence and the people's expectations.</p>
<p>Focus on Spring Planting, Draft Plans</p>
<p>The issue of spring planting is both critical and pressing. The authorities are paying great attention to it. There are detailed plans for lending seeds, plowing cattle, and farm tools to meet the needs of the people. In fact, the government's past relief to the people has been small and slow. The people have always been able to find solutions to their lives in the face of helplessness. What the people hope from the government is stability and less disturbance. We especially emphasize the principle that "Removing abuses is more important than promoting benefits." We coordinate with the military to eliminate the harassment of the Communist troops, so that the people can be guaranteed to engage in production. In addition, we reduce the people's corvée labor, resolve land disputes, and either incorporate or disband the "miscellaneous" troops scattered in the countryside, so as to prevent them from disturbing the local area and hindering cultivation. These are all obstacles that should be eliminated before spring planting. The authorities encouraging production are also paying attention to these issues. As for building water conservancy and well irrigation, the authorities are also actively preparing, but it is easier said than done. We don’t need to write this check just yet.</p>
<p>Relief efforts are quite active. Materials from the Good Rescue Work Team are constantly arriving. Personnel to handle emergency relief always arrive with the army whenever a region is recovered. However, there are too many people in need of relief. There is a feeling that “there are too many monks and not enough gruel.” Sometimes, people receive Western suits, women’s scarves, and children’s shoes, which are laughable and tearful when worn. Or they receive a few cans of milk, how can that save the people from famine?</p>
<p>Improve Education, Cultivate Teachers</p>
<p>The enemy's eight years of enslavement education and the CCP's one year of red education have injected poison and planted hidden dangers into this generation of pure seedlings, making their awareness of the country and nation very vague, and their concepts of human ethics weak. "In Chongli County, an old lady over seventy years old was tied up by the Eighth Route Army. Her grandson, a village cadre, shot her when she begged for mercy!" This is the masterpiece of CCP education. "Strengthening the awareness of struggle" is the heroic behavior praised by the CCP! Therefore, today, education in the recovered areas not only needs to be restored but also needs to be thoroughly reformed. Chahar Province is starting with cultivating teachers. Each county should have at least one simple normal school, emphasizing both quality and quantity, gradually reaching the point of one primary school per district. Currently, there are only 2,000 middle school students in the whole province, which is pitifully few. No schools above the specialized level have opened yet.</p>
<p>Power Plant Destroyed, Light Awaits</p>
<p>The destruction of the power plant in Xiahuayuan is truly a pity. The Japanese invaders had not completed it even after four years of construction. Once completed, the 60,000-kilowatt electricity could make the towns along the Pinghuan line bright. The Communist troops "excellently" destroyed it. Now, it needs to be supplied with light itself. Factories powered by electricity have all stopped. The Communist troops had already transported machines that do not require electricity to the "base area." The Resources Committee plans to repair this project, but funds, technology, and equipment are still nowhere to be found. There is still a long way to go before we can have light.</p>
<p>Although the people of Chahar Province are still groping in tears and sighs, they already have new enlightenment. The storm has passed. Like waking from a nightmare, new hopes are breeding new beliefs. The demands of "survival" and "life" will converge into a magnificent force, advancing in a new direction.

<p>Civilian Firefighting Can Be Learned From</p>
<p>The fire on Wuding Road last month prompted citizens to call for civilian-run firefighting due to dissatisfaction with the municipal fire brigade. The investigation committee, led by Chairman Ge and Director Zhang, specifically inspected the civilian-run fire brigade in the Shanghai South District and listened to the reports of Chairman Mao and Director Hua. It was reported that the association was founded during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, over seventy years ago. Its ability to maintain such a long and glorious history is not due to abundant economic conditions but is supported by a spirit of volunteer service. I believe Chairman Mao's statement that "anyone can do well with money, no one can do well without money" is not entirely true for civilian firefighting. It should be known that for all public welfare undertakings, as long as the public treats it as their own business, the future will definitely be bright. Therefore, I have deep expectations for the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade.</p>
<p>Since the major fire on Wuding Road in this city, the whole city has been in turmoil, with discussions on the streets, in teahouses, and in taverns. The rights and wrongs have been publicly disclosed in the newspapers. All the facts are gradually becoming clear. In short, economics is an important issue, but spirit is also an important issue. Therefore, economic equipment and volunteer spirit are both essential basic factors. Furthermore, if it is supplemented by moral behavior, satisfactory results can be achieved. On the 9th of this month, the Wuding Road fire investigation committee, led by Chairman Ge and Director Zhang, along with Director Wang Yeyu and more than a dozen reporters, came to inspect the civilian fire brigade in the Shanghai South District due to the sensational call for civilian-run firefighting. After Chairman Mao and Director Hua gave detailed reports, it was felt that the association has such a long history without being eliminated or declining. The reputation of volunteer civilian firefighting and the glory of national commendation have not been obtained by chance but are truly created by spirit and volunteerism. Chairman Mao’s statement, "Anyone can do well with money, no one can do well without money," only refers to economic aspects. It is presumed that he did not have sufficient time to mention volunteer spirit and morality. Chairman Ge then asked the director of the South District, Zhu Kuangshi (a current member of the City Council), what his thoughts were on the Wuding Road fire. Director Zhu replied without hesitation: "It is unacceptable for the fire brigade to take so long to put out the fire." His statement only concerned the lack of effective firefighting and did not mention volunteer spirit and morality. Although seizing other people's belongings at the fire scene damages moral reputation and violates the law, as well as concerns the entire fire brigade organization, it cannot be ignored and should be investigated and reviewed. Even though the legal and criminal aspects have been handed over to the court for handling, it is also necessary to be vigilant to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. If it is believed that the past is over, then future misfortunes may continue to arise. Director Zhu's brief remarks aroused endless concerns about the future of civilian firefighting. It is imperative not to cause fires lasting more than thirteen hours or situations like the one on Wuding Road, or else a stronger reaction will be encountered. You can’t eat a mouthful of rice, but you can’t say a mouthful of words. Now that Director Zhu has spoken, it is hoped that all the volunteer firefighters will muster their spirits and provide practical service to make up for what Director Zhu said. The final evaluation of the inspection results was that the government-run firefighting "only thinks and sighs," while the civilian-run fire brigade in the Shanghai South District appears calm and well-organized. The conclusion drawn is that for any public undertaking to succeed, the people must treat it as their own business. This accurate conclusion shows the intelligence of the leaders and the wonderful publicity of the reporters. It is also hoped that they will continue to provide assistance, so that civilian public undertakings can blossom and bear good fruit. Since the lesson and stimulus of the Wuding Road fire, whenever a fire occurs, the speed of water output, the agility of actions, the bravery of everyone, and the priority of everything are vastly different from before. The proverb "Knowing shame is akin to courage" is hoped to be remembered forever! (Liu Meiyi)</p>
<p>The Roads in Caojing Town Need to Be Repaired Urgently</p>
<p>Editor: Since the suburban buses of the Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai-Caojing special buses of Xiang Sheng Transportation Company began operating in Caohe Town in western Shanghai last year, transportation has become much more convenient. The only regret is that the roads are in poor condition. The section from the city to Longhua is still acceptable, but the section from Longhua to Caohe Town, especially the Zhongshan West Road, is simply too poor! This section of the road is full of potholes of varying sizes and depths. Vehicles travel on it, and the bumps and jolts are beyond description. Even small cars are in danger of overturning. It is hoped that the Public Works Bureau will send workers to repair it as soon as possible. If there is a shortage of funds, a few tons of gravel can be used to fill the holes one by one, and then some coal ash can be used to pave it flat. Fortunately, the route is not long, only about 1,500 meters. The weather is gradually warming up, and the number of military vehicles traveling on this road is gradually increasing. Therefore, I urge you to repair it as soon as possible to avoid accidents. (Xue Linsheng, Joint Office of the 345th District of the 26th District of Shanghai)</p>

<p>Reply to Mr. Chen Jinsu and Xing Sheng: Regarding your letter describing the situation in Fushan Township, we have received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "The Jiangyin County Government has been ordered to investigate." Pray to initiate water conservancy projects in the canal basin. Survey of Huaiyin Dams</p>
<p>The Huaiyin Ship Lock, built by the Huai River Water Conservancy Commission in 1926, is located six kilometers northwest of the city and is one of the water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. The year-round navigation of the canal (which can accommodate ships of up to 600 tons) and the irrigation of farmland on both sides benefit from it. The Yangzhuang Movable Dam, a control project for the Huai River's channel to the sea, is located eight kilometers northwest of Huaiyin City and was completed in 1937. During the occupation, it was wantonly destroyed by the enemy and puppets and is now unrecognizable. Everything that could be destroyed by human force, such as steel gates, wooden materials, and opening and closing mechanisms, has been dismantled. Even the steel sheet piles buried deep underground and the expansion and contraction steel bars in the concrete have not been spared. The management office buildings are reduced to rubble, which is a major loss for water conservancy construction in northern Jiangsu. In order to restore the above projects, the commission has sent engineering personnel to the dams to conduct surveys and plans for separate repairs. The figures show the current state of the Huaiyin Dam:</p>

<p>Yesterday's Slaughtering Knives Sounded Fiercely, Now He Must Rely on Previous Accounts</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Tani Hisao caused too much injustice and hatred to the people of Nanjing. He condoned his subordinates in slaughtering 400,000 people in Nanjing. It is pain, hate, blood, and tears. The fate of the butcher, judged by the court, of course, deserves to be torn to pieces.</p>
<p>In three consecutive major trials, there were accusations from the victims' families, testimonies from those who personally experienced the danger, and righteous statements from international friends. The sound of "kill," "rape," "adultery," and "capture" from the Lishi Society was heart-wrenching. The heartless butcher, with a ferocious appearance, still quibbled in court and shirked responsibility, truly "deserving to be killed," "deserving to be killed."</p>
<p>Today (the 25th) is the fourth public trial of the butcher, still presided over by Major General Shi Meiyu. Tani Hisao was escorted in by six military policemen at nine o'clock. He looked old and dejected and was no longer as comfortable as before, probably driven by the conscience of "bone" and "blood"!</p>
<p>After Judge Shi announced the opening of the court, he first questioned Ogasawara Kiyoshi, who testified for Tani Hisao. According to his testimony, "The troops that entered Nanjing were after noon on the 12th, entering the city through Zhongshan Gate. Tani Hisao's troops entered the city through Zhonghua Gate on the morning of the 13th. At that time, the authority was with Yanagawa, and Tani Hisao was only a troop commanded to attack Nanjing." Naturally, everyone has a national concept. Ogasawara Kiyoshi's rebuttal is naturally to defend his own people and is not worth our attention.</p>
<p>Tani Hisao’s guilty conscience in killing people Shi Meiyu severely refuted him</p>
<p>The devil Tani then made a rogue quibble: "The attacking troops included parts of the 114th and 18th Divisions, directly subordinate troops, and special forces. How can it be specifically said that the defendant's troops committed criminal acts? At the same time, the victims summoned by the court all vented their resentment towards the Japanese on the defendant. It is neither credible nor can it be used as strong evidence of guilt. The numbers and names of the perpetrators are also not specifically stated. In terms of location, it is not under the jurisdiction of the defendant's troops. In terms of time, it was also mostly after the defendant's troops were transferred or during fierce battles. In terms of the actual situation, the battlefield at that time was in a no-man's land. Therefore, this kind of witness is actually a kind of imagination and is also a forgery. It is unfair to make a judgment based on this kind of statement. Please, the court, handle it fairly based on the facts." Judge Shi refuted him with stern words before the translator finished translating, "Since the defendant's superior commander or subordinates cannot appear in court to testify, this court still needs to make a fair judgment. The hundreds of thousands of people who were brutally killed cannot be used as evidence of the defendant's guilt, of course, an investigation is needed and not an immediate judgment. Why can the defendant know in advance that it is unfair? This can prove that the killer has a guilty conscience. From the newly discovered evidence, the troops under the defendant's command slaughtered about 7,000 people in the Zhonghua Gate area. The Lonely Soul Stele written by Gao Guanwu, the pseudo-governor of Nanjing in January 1939, can be used as proof. The printed version of the Lonely Soul Stele was presented to the devil Tani by the court, and the photographers were busy taking pictures of this trace of slaughter at this time, actually speaking for thousands of people."</p>
<p>A Book of "Blood and Tears of the Fallen Capital" Settles the Accounts for the Citizens</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Naval Headquarters testified in court, detailing the various brutal acts of the Japanese army after capturing Nanjing. However, after Director Wu was questioned, Tani cunningly replied, "I don't know what relationship the witness's statement has with the defendant!" Because the defendant was the passive one, and the protagonist was General Yanagawa, wanting to push his bloody responsibility completely clean with one sentence. At this time, Judge Shi presented the "Blood and Tears Record of the Fallen Capital" in court and summoned Major General Guo Qi, the author of this book, who is currently receiving training in the Army University, to testify. He said that the atrocities committed by the Japanese army when they invaded Nanjing were countless. What is listed here is just a drop in the ocean. What I wrote was all eyewitnessed facts, and I am absolutely responsible. The purpose of writing this article was originally to commemorate the compatriots who died. Unexpectedly, today, it would be placed in court to testify for the 400,000 souls. It is also an unexpected gain. Major General Guo then presented various atrocities committed by the Japanese army: (1) Japanese soldiers ordered more than 30 farmers to catch fish in a pond outside Zhonghua Gate. It was cold and the water was freezing. Those who entered the water were not allowed to come up and froze to death. Those who did not enter the water were killed. (2) Japanese soldiers raped women outside Zhonghua Gate and then ordered their sons to rape their mothers again. (3) A woman changed into men's clothing and passed through Zhonghua Gate. She was recognized by Japanese soldiers and was gang-raped by five men passing by at the same time. The men refused. Coincidentally, a monk passed by. The Japanese soldiers let go of the five men and ordered the monk to have intercourse with the woman. The monk refused and died from being shot. (4) Japanese soldiers hung an old man high on a tree at Zhonghua Gate and aimed at him to shoot and break the rope. The old man fell to his death, and they laughed at it. (5) Women who took refuge in the International Committee were snuck in by Japanese soldiers every night and raped one by one, called "fishing." (6) Japanese soldiers used relief as a pretext to lure women in, learned their addresses, and then went to rape them at night, called "fishing."... All of the above atrocities occurred from the 12th to the 17th.</p>
<p>After the translator translated, Tani Hisao widened his eyes and cunningly asked, "Please tell me the unit, number of the perpetrating troops. If the unit number cannot be pointed out, these facts are not sufficient to be evidence." At this time, everyone glared at this damn thing.</p>
<p>The "Asahi Shimbun" Boasted About Military Achievements and Served as "Self-Confessed" Ironclad Evidence</p>
<p>At this time, Judge Shi Meiyu told him another powerful piece of evidence, that is, the International Committee, which was formed by the United Kingdom and France at that time, had detailed records of the crimes committed by the Japanese army at that time. There were as many as 425 cases of murder and rape alone, and there were also cruel acts of killing as a competition. It is said that the one who killed the most people at that time was a Japanese soldier, who had killed 705 people. However, later, another Japanese soldier broke the record and killed 706 people! These facts were also published in the "Asahi Shimbun." In addition, he took out a photo album for Tani to see, which was all taken by the Japanese army themselves. The photos were full of true records of the Japanese army's savage and inhuman killing for pleasure!</p>
<p>After Tani Hisao looked at those photos, he was first speechless. He stroked his little beard and said, "I also saw similar photos at the prosecutor's office. At that time, I was very surprised and ashamed to see such cruel situations. However, I only stayed in Zhonghua Gate for a very short period of time. The troops were in a hurry, so it was difficult to do those things. The facts in the photos cannot explain that they happened in Zhonghua Gate."</p>
<p>Two Hours of Quibbling: The Butcher Denies the Crime of Murder</p>
<p>The court continued at 2 p.m. Tani gave a lengthy defense, lasting two hours, and all of its content consisted of denials and non-acknowledgments. Tani first stated that the defendant was not the highest commander of Zhonghua Gate. Those who participated in the attack on Zhonghua Gate also included parts of the 114th Division and the 18th Division. He had always been strict in governing the army, and the atrocities occurred mostly outside the area where the defendant's troops were stationed or after the defendant led the troops away from Nanjing. Many of the crimes lack concrete facts to prove the time and place. It is unreasonable and unjust to make the defendant the main culprit of the atrocities. Then, he quibbled on the three aspects of the crime investigation table, witnesses, and indictment, emphasizing that his subordinates had not committed acts of rape, murder, or destruction of property. Finally, he said that according to the American witnesses, movies, photos, and other witnesses and physical evidence, most of the atrocities occurred in the safety zone and Xiaguan area. It is unfair and wrong to say that these were committed by the defendant's troops. Moreover, the defendant: (1) As a soldier, coming to China to fight was on orders and cannot be held responsible for war crimes or crimes of aggression. (2) He had never heard of the massacre. Moreover, the military discipline was very strict. Since it was neither witnessed nor heard from residents, it can prove that no massacre occurred. (3) The evidence presented above is all false evidence. This is because the Chinese people are seeking revenge. Moreover, the victims were all in the garrison of other armies. Even if there were any, he cannot be held responsible. (4) When attacking Zhonghua Gate, the battle situation was fierce. Local residents could not have a mixed residence of soldiers and civilians. It could not have been rape and murder. The massacre mentioned by the witnesses was the most from the 12th to the 14th, which does not match the facts.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Mei Zufang also presented two reasons to defend him. This trial was just a routine "performance" and just passed the time!</p>
<p>At this point, prosecutor Chen Guangyu stood up and spoke, sternly refuting him. Chen said: How can a murderer like this, a butcher of mankind, be allowed to live? He should be sentenced to death by the court. Chen’s words were loud and powerful, and everyone responded with warm applause.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn: The Style of Huang Gongwang and the Landscapes of the Four Wangs.</p>
<p>Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Dong Siweng in his essays on literati painting, strongly divided landscape painting into Northern and Southern schools, promoting Wang Wei as the founder of the Southern school. He said: "Literati painting began with Wang Youcheng. Later, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Li Cheng, and Fan Kuan were the direct descendants. Li Longmian, Wang Jinqing, Mi Nan Gong, and his son were all derived from Dong and Ju, until the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Huang Zijiu, Wang Shuming, Ni Yuanzhen, and Wu Zhonggui, all followed the authentic tradition. Wu Wen and Shen of our Wu then received the mantle from afar. Ma Xia, Li Tang, and Liu Songnian are of the Li General school." This emotional view of promoting the South and suppressing the North is very unreliable. Looking at the landscapes of Wang Wei and the masters above him, they are all meticulous and realistic. Although they are better than Li Sixun's outlining and depiction, the detached and unrestrained atmosphere is, after all, rare and exceptional. Especially Wang Wei's landscapes, I have seen a piece of "Snowy Sky Picture" in the Palace Museum collection. The texture strokes are like iron wires, and the colors are as heavy as the green and blue of General Li, just as Mi Youren said: "Wang Wei's paintings are seen very often, all like carvings, not worth learning." And Zhang Yanyuan said: "Wang Wei was good at painting landscapes, incorporating both ancient and modern styles." However, we have never seen his "modern style" ink landscapes, and there is no way to guess. Su Dongpo praised Wang Wei's landscapes as having a "detached and ethereal posture," which may be an imaginary feeling.</p>
<p>Secondly, Dong Beiyuan of the Northern Song Dynasty liked to write about the landscapes of Jiangnan. The peaks of the mountains are often surrounded by clouds. Historians call him "Ink is like Wang Wei, color is like Li Sixun." When we look at his famous works such as "Dragon's Stay in the Suburbs" and "Cave Heaven Mountain Hall," they all tend to be heavy and have not escaped the meaning of outlining. As for the landscapes of Li Cheng and Fan Kuan, ink paintings are rarely found. Works such as "Stream Mountain Journey" and "Yao Peak Qishu Tu" are majestic and steep but lack detachment and tranquility. Dong Siweng insisted on categorizing them into the Southern school of ink rendering, which is somewhat biased.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, only Mi Nan Gong and his son are pure ink landscape painters. Gao Fangshan is the direct descendant of the Mi family. However, Mi Gao emphasized the rendering of "dots" and ignored the elegance of "lines." It was not until Huang Zijiu rose up and integrated the brushwork, texture strokes, and rubbing of Dong, Ju, Mi, and Gao that he opened a broad road of "dots, lines, and surfaces" in landscape painting, successfully becoming a groundbreaking painter who inherited the past and opened up the future. Ni, Wang, and Wu, who were contemporaries of Zijiu but younger in age, were the first to be influenced by him. Because landscapes before Zijiu either had surfaces without lines, or had dots without lines, or had lines without dots. After Zijiu, there were perfect landscape painting methods with "dots, lines, and surfaces" complete. Yun Nantian once said that Zijiu's paintings are: "Majestic and elegant, with vast changes, shedding the traces of complexity and simplicity, going beyond the confines of conventional paths, using the movement of the spirit, and revealing the secrets of nature." The Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains scroll in the Palace Museum that we saw, although many connoisseurs pointed out that it was a forgery, is consistent with Nantian's criticism. We have also seen the authentic fragment of Huang Gongwang's Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains, collected by Qian An, with fluent and easy brushwork, varied ink, neither simple nor complex, sweeping away the rough and fierce faces of the Northern Song Dynasty people, and revealing an atmosphere of innocence, wonder, detachment, and tranquility among the hills and treetops. This is not to say that the landscapes of Dong, Ju, Li, and Fan before Zijiu were not as good as Zijiu, but to explain that the style of landscape painting underwent a tremendous change with Zijiu.</p>
<p>After Zijiu, painters such as Ni Yunlin, Wang Shuming, Wu Zhonggui, Wen Zhengming, Shen Shitian, Dong Qichang, and even the Qing Dynasty masters were all greatly influenced by Huang Gongwang's style, dominating landscape painting for five hundred years. Especially the Four Wangs - Yanke, Lianzhou, Shiggu, and Lutai.</p>
<p>The landscapes of the Four Wangs all drew from Jing, Guan, Dong, and Ju, but their brushwork, ink, composition, and layout always jumped over Huang Gongwang's patterns and could not escape his style. Huang Gongwang's landscapes take the "lines" of Dong and Ju - hemp texture strokes, the "dots" of Mi Gao - Mi dots, and the surfaces of Jing and Guan - Jing Hao's combination of Daozi's brush and Xiang Rong's ink, which is the rendering of the "surface," put together and integrated. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the landscape style of scholars who regarded Huang Gongwang as a model was as prosperous as ten thousand streams converging on a sect and hundreds of rivers returning to the sea. Dong Qichang was in the transition period between the Ming and Qing dynasties. Wang Shimin and Wang Jian of the Four Wangs had interactions with Siweng. Siweng started with Huang Gongwang and ascended to become a master of Mi Gao's landscapes, directly and indirectly strengthening the influence of Huang Gongwang's style, making the Four Wangs faithfully and silently uphold the Huang Gongwang tradition, creating an unbreakable and uniform situation. Therefore, the landscapes of the Four Wangs often aroused criticism from contemporaries, even criticizing the landscapes of the Four Wangs as equivalent to the Eight-legged essay of the imperial examination era.</p>
<p>Since the landscapes of the Four Wangs are all loyal to Huang Gongwang, narrowness and fragility are naturally inevitable phenomena. However, the Four Wangs also have unique and successful works. At the same time, the Four Wangs are not far from us, and many genuine copies have been handed down. In addition to the Four Wangs collected in the Palace Museum, there are also many private collections. Recently, I saw four ink landscape paintings of the same size and all imitating Huang Gongwang at Meijing House. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, and Wang Yuanqi, all four paintings were like coming from the same hand. Among them, Wang Yuanqi's brushwork was the most vigorous, Wang Jian's ink was the most heavy, and Wang Hui's painting was more unique in terms of hills and brushwork compared to other works by Wang Hui. Yanke inscribed "Imitating Huang Gongwang's brushwork in the long summer of Wuzi." Wang Jian inscribed: "Many modern scholars learn from Huang Gongwang, but only Dong Siweng has the wonderful ability to surpass his master. I am afraid that this painting will be like Dong Jia imitating Shi Er. Throw the pen in dismay! Appreciated in May of Guiyi." Wang Hui inscribed: "I once saw Dong Huating's copy of Huang Gongwang's Autumn Mountain Mist and Rain Picture. The elegance overflows from the wrist. This is an attempt to imitate it, but I am afraid that I have not obtained its essence. Wang Hui, the Geng Yan Sanren, in the winter of Xinmao." Wang Yuanqi inscribed: "This painting is based on the Great Ridge of Fuchun, and the dense forest of steep valleys is used as Zifang's work. The brushwork is from light to dark. It is almost close to it. I have recently made two paintings, one for Mei Daoren and one for this painting. I intend to seek elegance but cannot be independent. I know that elegance lies between heaven and man. Scholars may not seek its samadhi in the corresponding place of the heart. Written at will. Wang Yuanqi, the Nongtai, wrote in the Shuangteng Study in the capital on the first day of October."</p>
<p>After looking at these four landscape paintings of the Four Wangs and referring to their inscriptions, I am more convinced that Huang Gongwang's style, in the painting circles of the Ming and Qing dynasties, almost had the feeling that "There is no beauty in the world that is different from Huang Gongwang!"

<h3>Society Committee of the City Council Decides: Relief Funds Will Not Be Reduced; Charitable Organizations' Real Estate Receives Tax Exemptions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Committee of the City Council held its eleventh meeting yesterday to discuss the tax on rent from the housing and real estate of various charitable organizations, with the aim of exempting them in order to provide more relief to the poor. It was decided to send the resolution to the Finance Committee for review before submitting it to the general assembly for discussion. Following this, the following measures were proposed to assist the city's relief efforts: (1) The 1.8 billion [currency unit omitted] allocated for social welfare bureau relief efforts will not be reduced. (2) The proposed allocation of 400 million [currency unit omitted] for the construction of refugee and orphaned children's shelters, as well as 270 million [currency unit omitted] for the projected spring and summer clothing expenses for the 1,700 refugees and orphaned children currently housed and those to be housed, will not be reduced, and the government is requested to allocate the funds promptly. (3) If the government has difficulties in allocating the aforementioned funds promptly, the government should be responsible for first arranging a temporary advance from financial institutions. (4) The orphanage on Metcalfe Road should be immediately merged into the Caohéjing Refugee and Orphaned Children's Shelter, and the original orphanage site should be used to establish a daycare center for working women. (5) The Women's Reformatory and Vocational Training Center on Tongzhou Road should be established as a continuous entity. (6) In addition to the refugee children currently being accommodated, there are still more than 2,000 homeless children who have not been taken in (according to Director Zhou's report), and the Social Welfare Bureau should be asked to find ways to accommodate them as soon as possible. The picture shows Mei Lanfang giving a speech; on the far left is Zhou Xinfang, and on the right is Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Celebrities Visit Refugee and Orphaned Children's Shelter: Mei Lanfang Expresses "Shame," Zhou Xinfang Encourages "Sense of Shame"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Caohéjing Refugee and Orphaned Children's Shelter in this city specializes in taking in homeless children from the streets, providing them with proper education, so that they can become good citizens and serve society. Due to limited funding, many of the shelter's operations cannot proceed. In order to initiate fundraising, Mayor Wu specially invited celebrities from all walks of life in the city to visit at 3:00 PM yesterday. Gu Qianlin, Rong Hongyuan, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Wei, Fang Zhichao, Zhang Bide, and others attended, and Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang also participated, and addressed all the orphaned children. Dr. Mei said: "The people of Shanghai have not done their best for you and should feel ashamed." Zhou Xinfang encouraged them with the words "sense of shame." Madam Chiang was originally planning to visit in person yesterday as well, but it was cancelled due to a last-minute matter.</p>
<p>When Mayor Wu and his party entered the shelter, all the children were standing in the square to welcome them. Mayor Wu, Gu Qianlin, and Wu Kaixian then gave speeches in succession. Gu Qianlin, Rong Hongyuan, Luo Youxiang, Hartung George, Wang Jinjie, Wang Tongyuan, and others made donations on the spot, with the total amount of donations reaching 170 million [currency unit omitted]. It is said that Mayor Wu's goal for this fundraising effort for the shelter is 1 billion [currency unit omitted], so that the shelter can add a small printing press, school, textile factory, automobile training class, telephone switchboard class, music class, etc., in order to cultivate their ability to be self-reliant.</p>
