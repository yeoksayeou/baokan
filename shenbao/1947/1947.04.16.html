<h3>三黨共同施政方針　國府日內正式公布　府委名單宣布後即就職</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕三黨共同施政方針公佈期，迄今晚止，尚未作最後決定。文官長吳　昌會主張在四月十八日由國府公布，因是日為國府奠都南京廿周年紀念日，如施政方針及府委名單於是日公布，較更有意義，惟當俟主席閱後作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕共同施政方針，業已定稿，前傳之十二條，大致無改變。惟將十五日下午五時孫科寓所集會中決定之條文，刻再加一前言，共大意如此：國府為實施　政促進民主，自政協以來，即欲延攬各黨派人士與社會賢達共同參加政府。羅不斷努力，現已與各黨派人士商定改組後政府之施政方針，業經三黨中常會通過，現即可付諸實行。茲公佈其內容十二條如下：（按：原文十二條，與本報上月所刋無大出入。茲　其主要數點分誌如次）（一）改細後國民政府，仍以和平建國鋼領為施政準　，以各黨派，社會賢達，共同負責，（二）以政治民主化，軍隊國家化之原則，為各黨派合作之　礎。在此共同合作之下，以謀政治之進步，國家之安定。（三）如中共願意和平，在鐵路交通恢復後，政府即以政治方法，謀取國內之和平。（四）各省市參會應盡力使任黨派人士參加，各省市府亦應盡力使各黨派人士參加。又修正第十一條文如下：「今後所有舉辦之外債，應指定專為穩定並改善人民生活及生產建設之用」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕十五日下午五時半孫科寓所會有集會，就共同施政方針作最後討論，計出席政府人士陳布雷，吳鼎昌，張羣，王世杰，吳鐵城，張厲生，邵力子，孫科；民社黨張君觔，蔣勻田；青年黨陳啓天。左舜生。對內容略作修改後，決定各繕就一份，於十六日以信件万式交換。國民黨並首於十六日晨舉行中常會，通過該項方針，再由主席召各黨人士，社會賢達，作最後一次審閱，亦即所謂簽署形式。三黨暨社會賢達之府委名單同時提出，經國府公佈後，新府委宣誓就職，組織新政府，同日召開首屆國府委會，討論改組政院問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕社會賢達之府委人選如次：莫德惠，胡適，章士釗，王雲五。惟胡適如堅辭，或王雲五仍續在政院担任部會職務，即以陳光甫繼之。以上五人，係經各黨派同意者。又政務委員決定五人，民靑兩黨各二名，由各該黨自行推定。社會賢達為繆雲台。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕蔣勻田頃語記者，民社黨參加府委會之人選，大致業經確定。伍憲子原以因病請辭，現已荷同意，約兩週後來京。餘為戢翼翹，徐使檾，胡海門共四人。又民社黨政委為　大明，蔣勻田二人。</p>
<h3>立法院便會通過議案　小四行官股收回　銀行法草案今繼續討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立法院十五日晨九時半舉行三二一次例會，孫院長主席。會中討論各案，大部有關經濟，收回小四行官股案及全國經委會組織條例兩按中國通商，中國實業，國貨及四明等四行，原非國家銀行，抗戰前因發生擠兌風潮，政府為穩定金融計，曾加入官股千餘萬（富時法幣），幾佔小四行全部股東百分八十左右，惟各該行歷年來多未將官息及官股應得盈餘解繳國庫，立院財。經等委會前開第四屆第四十次聯席會譏時，議決，各該行官股部份應由政府按各該行資產减去負債之净値，分別收回。該案十五日於例會提出時，除孫九錄等委員主張綏予收回外，多數僉主為劃分公私界限及確定國家銀行制度計，應即收回。張肇元追溯官股加入小四行經過，並分析官股所佔比例，認國家當時投資千餘萬元，若照目前幣値估計，其數當在千億以上，而政府一年收入僅六百五十萬，祗及戰前數目，其利益盡為辦事人中飽，國家吃虧太大。衛挺生亦認由財政觀點研究，政府殊不合算，與其令少教人獲利，不若予以出售，以彌補國家預算之不足。李慶塵不主張收回官股，而主張將為數絕少之商股，由政府收購，使小四行成為國家銀行，最後表決，在塲者八十餘人以七十二票最大多數通過，小四行官股由政府按净値分別收回，處理辦法由財部會同有關機關草擬。繼討論梅委員恕曾等三十九人所提小四行退出之官股應以現有之資產總數公開估價出售案，其辦法為由監察機關主持，並依官商股份按比例分配公開出售，並將購買者之姓名公布，辦理本案及主持小四行之人員不得購買，以避嫌疑，討論時，多數立委認執行時牽涉過大，辦理亦非易事，決議原則通過，與前案併案送政府採擇施行。會中另一要案為全國經委會組織條例，經濟委會委員長樓桐孫說明審查　過後，簡貫三等委員即起立反對，認此一駢被機構殊無存在必要，蓋全國經委會委員數目過多，職權亦過龐大，並無人民代表參加，旣有行政院會議，似無另立機構必要。鍾天心等認在目前經濟情况下，此一，機構之設置有其必要，其職權亦不一定興政院會議重覆。樓桐孫指出，全國經委會將為一「經濟幕僚機構」，專重經濟事務之研討與聯票，有此機構當較無此機構為為好，決議交財，經。法制之委會，再為內容之審查，會議至下午三時許始散。並因銀行法草案，國代選罷法施行細則等要案尚待討論，決議十七日開三二二次例會，繼續研討。</p>
<h3>增加敎育經費　多設專科學校</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕立法院十五日會議，報吿事項後，討論：（一）財政委員會會同刑法委員會報吿審查修正鑛業法條文草案，決議通過。（二）財政委員會會同經濟委員會報吿重行審查修正省銀行條例草案，決定含義修正通過。（三）財政委員會會同法制委員會報吿審查委員陳安仁等提議，建議政府增加敎育經費，多設專圖學校，容納未能進入大學之高中畢業青年，並增設職業學校，　納未能升學之初中畢業以上程產之靑年案，決議照審查意見通過，函請主管機關於下年度編遺預算時，在可能範圍內，注意多設專科學校，對對從軍高中畢業失學靑年，按其程度，分別編入大學或先　班肄業，其已入大學者，應給予優待，並令各省政府多設職業學校。（四）民法委員會會同法割委員會，經濟委員會報吿核復僑民典當不動產回贖辦決案案，決議照審查意見通過。審查意見，以回贖期間及應吾以原價回贖問題，已有復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第七條又第十二條兩條之規定，足資適當，似可不必另訂辦法。（五）財政委員會會同經濟委員會報吿重行審查提請將中國通商，中國實業，中國國貨及四明四銀行之官股，由政府按净値分別收回案，決議照審查意見通過，關於官股之收回，由財部會同有有關機關處理。（六）委員梅恕曾等提議，通商，實業，國貨，四明四行退出之官股，應以現有之資產總總額，公開估價出售案，決議原則通過，併上案送請政府採擇施行。（七）刑法委會會同財委會，經委會報告擬　定黃金外匯買賣處罰條例　草案案，修正通過。（八經濟委員會會同法制委員會報告審查全國經委會組織條例草案案，決議再交經濟財政法制三委員會研究，審查內容。（九）刑法委員會會同法制委員會報吿辦理漢奸在裁判前死亡，其財產處置之補充規定一案案，決議將懲治漢奸條例　第八條條文修正。（十）刑法委員會報吿修正禁烟禁毒治罪條例第十六條條文案。</p>

<h3>僑務的先決問題</h3>
<p>僑務委員成立於民二十一年四月十六日，今年恰逢十五周年紀念。從遜清咸豐九五設立僑務機構以來，到今天的僑委會旣經滄海桑田的九度變遷了。</p>
<p>該會呱呱墮地，正值空前的狂風暴雨的前夕，國難正股。僑務之花開得暗淡，而無光輝。迨後痛經剝皮見骨的外患一步一步逼來，空前的狂風吹了八年，暴雨打了八年，把僑務之花吹得七零八落，經過了艱辛重疊着媽辛的八年，首長領導着同仁堅苦卓絕地守着崗位，憑幾碗淡飯，幾間草屋，備經憂慮與驚險，做到敵人投降，勝利到來，滿想雨過天青，讓僑務結些果實，誰料暴風雨接連着暴風雨，僑務之果始終長不大，負責人少，批評人多，大家不免起憤慨之情，和抑鬱之感，然而情感對事實，究竟可以有多少助益？大家惟有忍耐下來，忍耐革命過程中所需要的忍耐，忍耐的期待着明年，後年，再後年…在止水一樣的日子中，像發霉腐爛的境遇中，一天一天地挨過，十五年僑務歷史就這樣造成。這是一部辛酸史，也是一部堅貞史。</p>
<p>世界上沒有一個國家像中國的僑民多到一千二百萬那麼多，世界上也沒有一個國家像中國的僑民苦難到早不保夕的那麼苦。四散在六十四國的大羣華僑，早早夜夜的胼手胝足在耕耘，做苦力，做佃傭，而人家在收獲，做鉅商，做地主，養肥着人家去住大洋房，坐大汽車，喫着受用，而我們華僑住壞的，吃壞的，還要說華僑不文明，要罵就罵，要打就打，要宰割便被害，要屠殺便屠殺，次殖民僑胞的圖畫，是怎樣一個景色！</p>
<p>經過劃時代的大戰，聽過原子彈炸聲的人類，依然是腔利害心思，戰時華僑受盡敵人的慘毒，血汗結晶，全部歷燼，寃鬼盈野，血海斑斑；戰後驚魂未定，重罹池魚之殃，面臨着死刑的威脅，統治者　幹到底，被統治者革命到底，來在兩極端之下的我們海外孤兒，竟成了勝利的災兒！僑胞的災殃便是我們的痛苦，也便是今日僑務的一大課題，放眼看將來，殖民地國內的華僑前途必定兇多吉少，看暹羅的流血，看荷印的屠殺，看越南的燒刦，看菲島的排華，再聽馬來亞人反對把公民權分給外國僑民的吼聲，「排他性」的氣焰，已高沖到凌霄，以前華僑的問題是如何「自處」。將來華僑的問題是如何「自存」，自處為生活問題，自存為生存問題，華僑的自處與自存便交織成了今日僑務的問題。</p>
<p>問題越來越嚴重，但單在問題本身上轉念頭是無法解決的，因為問題本身原不成為問題，而問題之千百萬皆由其他問題為之主因。國弱民貧實在是大問題。所以只靠一個旣無錢又無力被人忽視脆弱的僑務機構，老實說是無濟於事的。但目前僑務機構該做些問題本身以外的事件，這便是僑務的先決問題。乘該會十五週年紀念佳節，說一些今日僑務機構應做的先決事件吧。</p>
<p>一，喚起僑務的意識：意識是態度，是行為，有什麼意識，須有什麼事蹟，但是國人的僑務意識似乎太不够了，今後學校應設僑務和南洋史地等課程，輿論界應大事鼓吹僑務之重要，僑委會應多用筆舌廣為報導僑務事業，務須僑務家曉戶諭，人人從心底裏感覺僑務之不可少，只有僑務意識上下一致的繼長增高，把僑務的種子種入你的心他的心大家的心裏！才可把僑務從因循茍且的　　裏搭救出來。</p>
<p>二，行政上通力合作：政府是一個有機體，各部門行政機構的職權必須劃清，所有一切行政彼此必要通力合作，歐美勵行「職位分類制度，」因事設官，因官治事，事各確定它的分際，官各遵守它的職權，踰越官守，便是「越俎代庖，」廢弛官守，更屬「素餐戶位」，與僑委會有關係的部門，厥為內政，外交·經濟·教育和社會五部，除華僑教育·文化事業和社會團體業經劃定清楚，海外的由僑委會主管外，尚有移民·貿易·振濟·慰勞等，猶待確定。我意不妨開會商定，旣經決定後，權不必爭，責不必諉，功不可歸已，過不可歸人。僑務事情不是宣傳事業，有許多事常引起外人誤會，或刺戟外人，有時把事先行發表了，主管的辦起來，反感棘后，這是害了國家，害了僑胞。大家要認清：一切活動是為了國家，一切利益要歸諸國家。</p>
<p>三，爭取僑胞向心力：僑胞愛國家愛政府是天性，具有本能的傾向，而且因為愛盡外人的壓迫，對祖國特別愛護。愛國之心高漲得比國內人民更甚。縱使祖國遺忘他們，他們卻無時無刻不懷念祖國，正像一相情願的單戀，他們見到青天白日紅地的一頂小旗，就把他們的驕傲與希望，都寄託在那面旗上。所以華僑對祖國的向心力是絕無問題的。問題卻是祖國自身樹起了太多障碍，逼得他們離心力一天一天地長大起來。例如保僑不力，往往慘案發生良久，死者墓草已長，才派員去宣慰或提出抗議，但宣慰與抗議，究竟救了多少華僑生命財產？除了宣慰與抗議外似乎沒第二件事可做。磕頭的外交實令僑胞肝腸寸斷。第二個問題是居留地對僑胞匯款額的限制。劉心如先生說「菏·法·英等國，均限制僑胞匯款，每月不能超過十鎊」。馬來亞代表郭新先生說，「當地政府限制華僑匯款，每月不得超過四十五元。」這些束縛著華僑的枷鎖，外交部并未為之交涉開放。第三種情形是國幣之值低落，僑胞過去所購買的節約建國儲蓄救國公債等，如澳洲以澳幣一百五十餘鎊買國差額，若以千倍計算，澳幣一鎊即合國幣萬元，在這種情形下，罄其所有購買各期債券的僑胞是何等的損失。</p>
<p>四，僑務人才要培養：建國必先建人，建人必先建官。欲求建設僑務，必先建設僑務行政人員，務使每個僑務行政官在建國建僑過程中發生大作用大效率。辦僑務的人不一定海外回國的華僑，也不一定華僑出身地方的人，有時這些人反而不及他省人，因為這些人有意見，有帮派，有地域，有氏族等等的傳統仇視，要華僑大團結，還是中間人來負責主持，比較易收統一之效。不過未出國的人辦僑務，受訓後必須出國見習，至少須往海外視導調查數處，庶不致所學成為紙上談兵，辦公變為閉門造車，僑委會實是一個僑務大學，平日耳濡目染，浸潤其間，假使肯認真學，未始不能造成僑務專家。最緊要的是國家應在若干大學內，設立僑務或僑務院，選擇對國家有了解有熱忱，有抱負的青年，培養僑務上的福利，管理·管理·教育·經濟·貿易·視導諸種人才，必要時，可辦短期僑務講習班，事業愈發達，人才愈需要，你要不要人才，就看出你要不要事業。</p>

<h3>對德和會及和約　美聲明兩點</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十四日電〕美國國務卿馬歇爾頃向報界發表談話稱：美國提議對德和會應依照聯合國憲章之精神，凡曾對德宣戰之各國均應參加和會，惟在相會表決時，應將各國分為有資格投票者與無資格投票者兩類，前一類之國家可分為兩種：（一）德國之鄰國；（二）在軍事上實施參加對德作戰者。此外，美國又提議在德國新憲法中增加一項條款，授權德國政府批准對德和約，至德國公民投票複決時，如將此項憲法予以通過，則德國全國人民對於接受此項和約而發生之責任，均應負之。在此稱條件之下，對德和約應由德國政府簽字及批准，美國並不表示與議云。</p>

<h3>德國蔣領多人　曾謀推翻希魔</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕美國前駐德瑞戰略處主任杜爾斯新著「德國之地下組織」一書，定今日發行，其中透露德國將領多叭，曾於一九三八年，即第二次世界大戰爆發前一年，密謀政變，推翻希特勒。惟在前德軍參謀長哈爾特辦公室密議發動政變時，英前首相張伯倫突至慕尼黑求和，政變計劃遂吿終止。此事起因於德國民主派文官及將領，以為戰爭一發，德國必敗，乃決心加以挽救，但因希特勒在慕尼學外交勝利，　變　念　之消失。此後密謀接速不斷，政變與暗殺希特勒兼而有之，但均歸失敗，終於一九四四年七月發生大敗露，主持其事者大部被誅。</p>
<h3>美國對德供應　約達五億美元</h3>

<h3>美眾院反美調查委會　要求檢舉華萊士　華氏已表示愉置諸不理</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕國會方面今日要求對前副總統華萊士提出刑事控訴，並重新讉靑華氏在國外之演說，但杜魯門總統仍守緘默。衆院反美活動調查委員會擬根據舊日之洛根法檢舉華氏，該法規定凡美國公民「通謀」外國政府破壞美國政策者得處徒刑三年，罰鋸五千元。該委員會主席共和黨員湯麥斯稱，該法適用於華萊士，案情了然，檢察長克拉克必須加以檢舉。克拉克則拒不發表意見。又白宮新聞秘書羅斯宣稱，總統對於華萊士事件無言可告。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕華萊士演說抨擊杜魯門總統外交政策後，美國國會對之會作批評，華抵今日在此間提出答復，表示藐視，力稱「如有戰爭狀態存在，則余發表本人意見，始可被指為為敵張目。但終余一生，凡遇人民願聽余演說之處，余擬繼續發表和平論。」</p>
<h3>史泰遜招待記者　談渠與史達林會晤經過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社草莫期科十四日電〕一九四八年美國共和黨總統候選人史泰遜今日在此間招待記者，透露其上星期三日與史達林元帥談話內容之一部份，均係關於新聞檢查及報紙者。據稱，史帥吿以一部份美國新聞記者對於蘇聯懷有惡意，「吾國取消新聞檢查，將為困難之事。」史帥稱一部份記者發表之消息，描寫蘇聯政府「宛如一種動物園」。史帥又稱，蘇聯人並不發現美國共和黨與民主黨間有何重大差別，史泰遜稱，談話其餘部份關於經濟者，將在返美後提出之歐洲一般經濟報吿書中發表之。</p>

<h3>汽車撞死交大學生案　地檢處起訴車夫　市長昨召雙方調解　商經德士古公司同意　撥五千萬治喪　家屬撫恤費靜候法院宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德士古汽油公司卡軍撞斃交通大學學生賣子幹一案，被告懷機談金堂，當經新市街警察分局拘押，送地檢處偵查。本察官陸　振南以被告對犯罪事實供認不諱，且謂闖禍原因，爲「煞車不大好」，認爲被吿從事業務應注意並能注意而不注意，致人於死，實有刑法第二百七十六條第二項之罪嫌，合依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項提起公訴。</p>
<p>又對於此案，吳市長昨晨召築德士古公司經理及交大學生代表調解。昨晨十時許，交大學生五百餘人，結隊至市府呼籲，後因吳市長堅欲學生隊伍散退，留少數代表參加談判，交大遂椎派代表二十人，偕吳稅長，王主任，顏律師，及死者家屬等廿餘人，入市長辦公室與德士古代表談判。果市長當即建議二項解決辦法：（一）循法律途徑解決，可直接向地檢處起訴。（二）由雙方自行和解。吳市長並表示願意從中協助。德士古公司方面則認爲民事方面要求賠償，可以接受，至於刑事賣任，應由司機自行負責，雖經幾番折衝，但仍未獲圓滿結果，蓋因雙方之距離尙遠。交大方面，依據被害家屬之意見，要求德士古賠償家屬之撫恤費，須自二十九歲算起，至六十歲為止，每月數額一百萬元，再加以死者已受之敎育費等，總額爲五億八千五百萬元正。而德士古方面，最初僅承認二千萬元，該公司美籍法律顧問吳士並表示公司辦理此種案件，向來如此，有前例可引，致引起交大同學之不滿，昨經吳市長調解後，公司方面乃允於今日先行撥付治喪費五千萬元，至於家屬撫恤費，則靜候法院之判決。談判至昨午四時始吿一段落。</p>
<p>又：本報昨接交大學生自治會米函一件，其原文如次：「謹啓者頃閱貴報四月十五日所載交大同學被輾，於昨日「扣留」律師等新聞一則，查與事實不符。茲將經過情形略述於後：本校數學系同學賈君子幹於本月四日被德士古公司卡車撞傷致死，本校當局會向公司交涉，囑其料理善後並賠償死者損失。但該公司竟將公函兩度退還，謂洋人不識華文，顯　推諉責任。十四日德士古曾派華洋職員各一名來校，吳校長保豐及訓導處生活管理組王主任乃予以接見。而該二員竟拒絕談判，以爲必須家屬來滬，始可商討辦法。校長，同學會，同鄉會，均不足以爲家屬代表。且態度傲慢，出言不遜。凡此種種均可見其　視我國家之尊嚴，褻凟敎育之神聖。我同學成極憤慨，然以本校索重理智，僅令其通知公司負責人前來，並暫款二人在事務組內休息，以茶烟招待，且供給午膳。而彼等不與公司接治，反以電話報吿市政府，警察局，領事館，誣教同學之舉動爲「扣留」「敲詐」「勒索，」事後且對外界及各報館無恥造謠。其狂妄如此，實堪痛恨。若不嚴辭闢之，何以正視聽而維國格。素仰貴報言論公正，主持正義，而十五日所刋各節，實與事實大相逕庭，務祈查照，並予以更正。（按：本報十五日所載「輾　交大學生案，市長勸令和解」新聞一則，係中央社稿，文字中未有「扣留」，「敲詐」或「勒索」等字樣。）</p>
<h3>解決漁業困難　交換復興意見　各省市漁聨會議揭幕</h3>
<p>各省市漁聯會代表會議，昨晨九時在建國西路恒社舉行幕式。出席浙·閩·粵·台·蘇·魯·京。滬等八單位代表三十餘人，市社會局，中國農民銀行，中國水利公同，上海漁市場等均有代表列席。主席許蟠雲致詞。</p>
<p>加強團結·發展生產</p>
<p>略謂：「此次會議之旨，在集合各省市漁會同人共同研討，以便解決漁業界當前困難，交換復興戰後漁業之意見，並希望以此次會議爲出發點，進而組織全國性漁業團體，藉以加强團結，鞏國海權，發展生產」。次由社會局代表方溓致詞：「指明兩點，（下）中國漁業生產接術落後，亟須從事改進，俾得迎頭趕上先進各國。（二）全國性組織有利於漁業發展，希望各同人積極努力，保使早日實現」。</p>
<p>注重漁貸·漁鹽兩項</p>
<p>下午二時至五時，繼續開會，由各代表分別報吿各該省市漁業情况及進行計劃，對於漁貸及漁鹽兩大問題，尤爲重視。各代表認爲以日前實際情形而論，所謂漁貸，往往近於畫餅充機，即偶有發放，亦爲數極微，無裨漁民生產，而鹽務局所配之漁鹽，爲防止流人黑市，攙有紅土黃沙，鹽製品因之容易腐敗變色，漁民蒙受損害極鉅，故欲謀復興我國戰後漁業，此兩點漁民最大痛苦，必須設法根本解決之。按該會預定運續舉行三天，十七日閉幕，明日將討論各區提案，後日參觀本市漁業各項設備。</p>
<h3>古祖仕殉難紀念　昨日舉行追悼會</h3>

<h3>新聞事業使鄧神聖　不應予以摧殘侮辱　自由保障會秘書長感想</h3>
<p>近來各地相繼發生打報館之事件，本市人民自由保障會秘書長何元明，表示感想稱：「新聞事業負神聖之使命，褒揚良善，誅伐奸惡，對於社會正本培元，移風易俗，其貢獻超乎一切之上。他如鼓吹革命，宣傳抗戰，尤發揮其最大效能，功績不亞於執戈衛國之戰士，吾人應如何崇敬愛護，烏可予以摧殘與侮辱。近來各地發生搗毀報館情事，乃出諸知識靑年之學生之手，殊深遺憾。報紙果有記載失實之處，儘可依合理方法，進行交涉與解決，茲竟訴之武力，豈僅新聞界本身之不幸，抑亦社會間之不良風氣。値此民主自由之高潮中，首應尊重他人之自由，切不可誤解民主，以免眙笑外邦」。聞該會並已通函各地人民自由保障會，對於被毀之報館，一致予以正義之嚴援。</p>
<h3>四十種行業　工資率統計　電話業居首調味業最低　實際收入以造船業緊高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府統計室，特根據三十五年八月本市四十種行業，二百四十家工廠有關產業工人之工資材料，彙編上海市工資統計，內容包括工資率，實際收人，及工作時間間三種。</p>
<p>（一）工資率：在四十種行業中，平均每小時工資率，以電話業之一，一四四·三七元爲最高，調味業最低，爲二七八·八二元。各業總平均爲六〇七。八七元。每日工資率，仍以電話業居首，最低者爲電工器材業。本年每小時工資率，比戰前（民二埂五年）計高一一，〇五一倍。</p>
<p>（二）實附收入：包括各種津貼。除去請假，曠工，扣除之工資，及得所稅，罰工等項，即爲實際收入。本市各業之每日實際收入，以造船業為最高，以鉛律業為最低，古均每日實際收入為七，七三九·三〇元，每月實際收入仍以造船業為最高，火柴業爲最低，與戰前比較，增一四，二九九倍。</p>

<p>雷諾環球飛行專機過滬，在江　機塲上加油時情形，右上角圖，雷諾在機塲休息室中進餐。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>江灣機塲　記者業集　夜半　迎候　炸彈　雷諾專機過滬追記</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕勝利以來江混飛機塲成了本市的空運樞紐，冠蓋往來，送舊迎新，新聞記者時常能在那裏着到偉大的塲面。昨日凌晨二時，江灣機塲又成了記者們採訪的目標。被迎候的「貴賓」是原子筆大王雷諾駕駛的「雷諾炸彈炸彈」號專機，他們在銀白色探照燈　耀的跑道上，看到的是一個富於於歷史性而又富於趣味性的鏡頭。</p>
<p>原子筆大王雷　的宏願，是要打破美許士氏在一九三八年所建樹的環球飛行紀錄。當時許士的紀錄是九十一小時十四分，雷諾則希望能將環飛全球的時間，减爲六十五小時。</p>
<p>前日午前江灣機塲美軍空運大隊就接到雷諾來滬的消息。控制室內　日接到各報記者的電話，不斷地探詢雷氏抵達的時間。晚間十時許機塲上就有廿餘位記者等待這超速飛機的降落。</p>
<p>然而雷國諾的專機到午夜尙無消息。據加爾各答的電報，雷諾在上海時間午後六時零三分從印度起飛，照預算在午夜就應抵滬。一路倘無綫電機無變故，江灣機塲的通訊控制室早就應接到雷氏進展的報吿。然過了午夜尙無音信。一時記者們，及在塲美空軍人員，都疑心雷諾在飛越駝峯的時候，遭了意外。</p>
<p>到一時四十五分的時候，機塲通訊控制室的收報機，忽然收到很淸晰的呼號。擴音機中重復着說：「呌上海江辦機塲，呌上海江　機塲！」「雷諾炸彈號準備降落，當諾炸彈號準備降落！」十三分鐘後，雷氏的飛機終於在跑道上很平穩的降落了。專機停妥，雷氏愉快地下械來，與雷氏同來的有他的機師奧鄧姆和他的綫械員賽利。</p>
<p>飛機剛降落，美空軍大隊的人員就湧上去加油，檢查機件，及整理零件，託者們也就圍住了雷氏探詢飛行經過。市府交際科長張彼德，代表市長上前歡迎，並致贈市長簽名的主席傳記一冊。</p>
<p>據雷諾說：從加爾各答起飛後，即速度加至每小時三百六十五里。途中因因須超越駝峯，故而飛行高度平均在一萬九千呎以上。不論雷氏將來能吾打破環球飛行記錄，他自加爾各答到上海一段的飛行時間，（八小時）已是一個新記錄。</p>
<p>雷氏自紐約起飛後，雖然已有卅餘小時沒有睡眠，然他並不顯出痰乏的狀態。當他的專機在加油的時候，他就進了美軍食堂呌了一客火腿蛋果腹。他的機師和機械師却倒在專機的翼下，睡了半個多小時。</p>
<p>雷氏臨走，拿了兩校特製的原子筆，贈給市長和張科長。他表示創造六十五小時的新記錄，是不成問題的。當諾的機械師賽利，並打了一個電報給他的未婚妻，說：「我當準約，在今晚抵紐敘。明日婚禮仍照預定計劃舉行」。雷氏笑着說：一我爲我朋友的婚期、無論如何今晚要趕回紐約」！</p>
<p>三時許，機塲人員已將專機準備就緒，油箱中也加足了一千二百加侖汽油，足够直飛東京。</p>
<p>三時廿二分，雷氏的專機漸漸向跑道上推進，轉瞬就加強速度離地面向東京起飛了。</p>
<p>記者們在夜深露重的機塲上足足躭了五六個小時，這時方始鬆了一口氣。回到家裘，已是鷄鳴時侯，身子雖是疲倦到極點，可是想到能一睹這一架行將在航空史創造新紀錄的快機的廬山眞面目，也就覺得値得了。</p>
<h3>在阿達克緊急降落　中途遭遇強烈逆風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據合眾社昨晚電訊，當諾環球飛行專機，昨午後六時廿五分（上海時間），因機件發生障碍，已在阿留申羣島之阿達克，緊急降落，創造新耙錄之希望，已遭受嚴重挫折。據悉：雷諾炸彈號昨晨三時廿分由滬起飛後，同日晨六時五十八分飛抵日本東京附近之橫田飛機塲，停留九十分鐘，續飛往阿拉斯加。按照航程之推算，同日午後八時廿三分即可抵阿留申之安柯拉藝港。詎於北太平洋海上一萬九千呎之高空，道遇强烈之逆風，氣候惡劣，且多霧。嗣後西雅圖方面即接獲安柯拉基西北航空公司消息，謂已被迫降落。</p>
<p>〔合衆社十五日午夜廣播〕雷諾專機於晚九時二十七分（上海夏令時間）離阿達克飛往加　大之埃特芒登。雷諾否認飛飛機件發生障碍之說，渠稱，僅因氣候惡劣、爲安全計，而在阿達克暫停。抵埃特芒頓後，將直飛紐約，仍可望打破許士紀錄。</p>

<p>宣司令昨發表談話　警告滬投機商人　警備部經濟檢察人員已出動工作　　警備司令宣鐵吾，昨下午五時接見記者時，向投機份子製造謠言操縱壟斷，抬高物價，發出嚴厲之警吿，宣氏稱：一般投機商人，為達到發財之目的，不擇手段，唯利是圖。要知少數人發財，即係剝削大多數人之生存權利，當大多數人之生存感受嚴重之威脅時，必將起而反抗，則投機之少數人「圖利而來」，必將「失利而去」。宜氏並稱：主席此次來滬，對本市物價問題最表關心，已論示由市政府，警備部，共同負責，加强管制，嚴重澈查囤積投機商人，予以重懲。警備部方面現已出動各經濟檢舉入員，進行工作，所獲結果，分別移送主管機關處辦。　　分析物價上漲原因　　宣氏分析物價上漲原因，除人為之病壓應予產除外，尙需全國人民體念時局艱辛，减免無謂消耗，節衣縮食，共渡難關。宣氏對物價上漲，為求過於供及通貨膨脹之故一說，表示異議。渠認為此係資本主義國家之看法，我國實行民生主義，則此兩說實不成立。渠指出：我國之物價問題，主要者在於「浪費」與一分配不勻」，如物資方面而能切實限制浪費，嚴格實行分配，則物價之嚴重性，將吿失去。至通貨膨脹，英美在戰時亦有此現象，但英美政府實行物資分配制之後，物價問題並不嚴重。　　產生力量協助政府　　關於實行分配制，宣氏表示政府已作考慮，惟渠鄭重指出，社會大衆應即有所覺悟，產生力量，協助政府，政令始能有效推行。中國今日一切病源，要皆社曾尙無此一力量，否則中國一切問題，均可疲得解決云。統債穏中帶疲　　公債昨初穩後疲，傳集會有干涉之說，人心較虛。實隆雖進，五〇三室五一二室及散戶俱售。統丙晨開一三七〇〇元，高價一四二〇〇元，低價一二四〇〇元而後梢定，結果較前收計甲乙降三百元，丁挫二百元，戊跌四百元，統丙慘跌一千四，成交不過四日萬。外股上落互見　　外股昨中途因證券帮中人，鑒於自備外匯條例，業已取消，黑市金鈔，勢將回落，而有出籠，頗見疲軟，墾植煤礦有利，大衆爭買，獨見俏利，洋行中人仍吸怡紗美聯。午後加上廣帮吸收，終吿回好。治紗晨初自三九九〇〇元，步降至三八〇〇〇元低價，最後以四二五〇〇元高價結束。結果較前收計鋼業微挫，墾植獨漲一成，會德豐業廣怡啤電話平平，餘均微漲。貼放會昨舉行　第三次會議　　國行貼放委員會，昨日下午三時，由秦潤卿主持，假國行三樓會議室舉行第三次會議，歷時一小時半。其內容：（一）對工業貸款審委會送交案件三十九起，其中大部份可能獲得通過，批准總額約計十億元。（二）關於出口物資貸款審委會開始迄今尙未見案件送下，貼放會決通知銀錢業公會轉向各行莊催促。此外，工業及出口物資兩貸款審委會是吾僅限上海一埠，抑向全國各大都市發動一節，茲據該會林崇鏞秘書長表示，目前尚未考慮及此，現僅就本市先行扒動，如將來成績良好，當逐漸普及全國各地云。外銷茶市平定　新經井拆價趨輭　　疲憊多時之洋莊茶市，買戶雖仍岡抑價進取，但賣方鑒於價格方面，已跌至相當限度，漸時不忍再度輕脫，是以昨日僅有美星交易，惟市勢已能勉强不墜，行情呈徘徊之伏。至於各式內銷茶，進出迄少軒輊，市情平定如故。溫杭兩地之新龍井，到源依然不絕，惜品質日見蒼老，同業對拆價頻趨軟化，形勢明跌暗穩。　　〔又訊〕專以內銷見稱之屯溪毛舉，茲據產區消息，本年度新貨彼地業憶開秤，每斤為一萬五六千元左右，大致不久即能到滬獻新。又悉：今庚因天時和暖，各產區出品旣較往年為佳，且收成亦極樂觀云。　　〔又訊〕本年度溫州新龍井，自月初登塲以來，睡將兩旬。到源方面，連日在同泰祥及福裕等茶行，紛紛裝運下，堪稱不斷，迄目前為止，約有四百餘担到滬。並聞刻下產區製就者，已局不多，邇來雖値茶要樹生產旺盛之際，然其葉已不適合再製龍井，大都改製炒靑烘靑等花色，因此今後溫州新龍井，來源恐將銳减。受產地價昂影響　米爆裂續見高漲　社局拋售紅尖納胃欠佳　　〔本報訊〕米市因受產地價高影響昨繼續上挺。白粳交易價達十四萬四，其他亦均昇漲。白元高至十七萬。南北兩市塲共到貨七千餘石，社會局乃開始於市塲拋售蘇北紅尖，價每石十二萬零五百元，共計拋出二千一百三十包，然市塲納胃欠佳。昨無錫米價，高貨白粳已越十五萬，米商採運多感棘手。　　麵粉步升　　平價油照常配售，各油店門售價格不動。　　麵粉逐步上漲，本粉續升一二千元，洋粉步漲二三千元，麩皮續挺一二元，豆餅消化亦暢，連漲千餘元。　　黃豆奇貸可居，關昂三五千元，菉豆南洋甚貪，步升二三千元元。芝蔴穩堅之狀，生仁求過於供，南洋去路暢旺，飛漲七八千元。赤豆華南賡續猛升，再跳四五千元。　　紅糧微升一二千元，苞米依然退縮不前，蠶豆去胃不振，仍屬平正之格，各糧漲峯甚銳，猶無止境。呢絨銷旺價平　　日來毛織品呢絨市面步見好轉，以天氣漸慹，實銷增盛，男女中西服裝去路旣暢，各路客帮添辦亦股。本街各帮有進，以致茶會上及大批發戶與各門市舖，零躉交易，俱趨熱鬧。去路大多限於淡色薄貨及夏季貨品，售價方面則尙平平，與上前日相彷，無甚大上落。大有欲漲不能，欲跌亦不能之勢。製藥業領袖　請願配給外匯　　本市製藥工業同業公會，前為請求外匯專額，解決原料恐慌，公推該會理事長藝克民，黨委鮑國昌·葛鏞·曁委員陳銘珊·吳志衛·黃素封·周文同等七人為代表，向輸管會請願，幷面遞呈文，當經限額分配處李處長接見，并派邵家麟·示滋李兩博士代表詳細商討，對於申請配給外匯，准許原料進口，深　同情，允予轉達當局，務使關係藥廠存亡之外匯問題，得以迅總改善云棉紗布運天津　　〔本報訊〕麟閣輸前日自滬駛台裝疋頭七百七十餘件，運往基隆。昨日其美輪駛津，裝棉紗棉布一千八百餘件，食鑒二千六百餘包，以及雜貨等共約二千六百噸運天津，警備部派員查究　糖市宣告停做　　糖市漲風擴大，警　司令部昨特派員前往澈查眞相，委會當局為避免責任起見，宣吿暫行停市，因之人心稍虛，暗盤略軟。塲外秘魯砂跌至三十五萬五千元，乾包粗砂亦小一萬元。紗價高翔津瀋尤甚　客幫多採購北運　原棉騰漲影響棉紗成本　　〔本報訊〕紗市近日雖乏正式行市，惟實際做開價，廿支標準紗每件已在五百萬元關外。昨日北帮來電，廿支標準紗每件在天津可淨售五百三十萬元，在潘陽可净售六百萬元，（以上價格，均巳將折息耗損運費等扣除。）故本市市價雖高達五百萬元，一轉埠每件即可净賺三十萬元，客帮乃均樂於採購北運。　　又目前以花衣成本日高，如按昨日廿支紗印度原棉每祖一百十五萬元計算，每件棉紗需棉花三担半，已需四百萬元有零，再加工繳每件一百餘萬元，廿支紗每件成本已逾五百萬三元。各紗廠如按三月份自由買賣之議價出售，當將遭受虧蝕。據聞自上週起，各紗廠開出之廿支紗價，均在四百七八十萬元之譜云。　　（又訊）據業中人談：昨日外棉行市，因聞當局取消自備外匯准許進口辦法，價格又吿騰漲。綠輸管會在未定該項辦法前，廿支紗印度原棉每担市價，約合一百十萬元。旋該項辦法議定後，各外棉進口商，曾擬陸續自行籌集外匯，向外定貨。聞廿支紗印度原棉之定貨價，每担合七十萬元，再加二月拆息，每担成本在九十萬元之譜。故市價遂步跌入百萬元關內。昨聞自備外匯准許進口辦法取消，價又同漲至每担一百十五萬元云。　　塲外喊價一斑　　棉紗昨初開平穏嗣以廠家與外埠客商稍有垂靑，投機乘勢活躍，喊價繼續高昂，塲外喊價四十二支　鳳破千萬元大關為一〇二〇萬形，二十支特雙馬喊價五六凌〇萬，雙馬五一五萬，惟鮮成交。塲內仍陷停頓狀態。　　棉布榮辱互見　　棉布昨喊價疲不一，蓋以當局管制嚴格，新買活動為難，一般投機者有逢高吐脫之意，致行情擯持不振。龍頭細布喊廿一萬五千元，五福二五五〇〇〇元，惟聞暗中有十九萬元塞出者，其餘色布士林等，無何變化。又悉日昨晨紡建開售各種布疋，白坯掛牌為二十支　布乙植價格十五萬九千元，關價與上期相同，而塲外喊價有加兩二萬元收進者。討論核配聨總棉花　行總舉行會議　　〔本報訊〕行總昨為討論聯總棉花之核配事宜，特召集各關係方面，舉行會議。到行總李車敏。黃承道，聯總孔哈堡，紡管會業務處畏劉文騰，輸管會外棉核配會主委李榦等。討論經過，決定聯總棉花之核配辦法，先按外棉核配會原定核配辦法，及紡管會所提供之資料為依蹄。對上海市經紡管會收購半數棉紗之各紗廠卅九單位，根據其存底多寡，需棉緩急程度，予以優先核配，決再考慮分配外埠各紗廠。聞聯總目前在滬之存棉，共約九萬包。刻巳核配二萬餘包，尙有六萬包，即待核配。此外尙有四萬包，可望於最近裝滬。至於各級棉花及其價格，昨亦分別酌定，以絲毛八分之七英吋長，密特令（Middling）級品質為標準之棉花，每担規定為六十五萬元。其他各級價格，得依此比例核减或遞加云。本年蠶絲產銷計劃　下次政院會可討論　目的體卹蠶農增加生產　　〔本報訊〕據悉：蔣主席日前在滬聽取江浙蠶絲界耆紳褚輔成·冷禦秋·二氏，關於卅六年度蠶絲之產銷計劃後，返京後即着行政院翻查該項案件，惟以案件積壓關係，昨日行政院例會時，未及提付討論通過。惟可望於下次例會對中提出討論云。　　關係方面肝不：本年席蠶絲產銷計劃，早於本年三月間經由經濟農林兩部，轉呈行政院在案。想因政院人事更動，故稍稽延時日。惟此事旣經最高當局命令趕辦，常可望早日批下，以付施行。惟該項計劃，內容頗為複雜。將來實施之技術問題，頗費研究。且目前江浙兩雀，再過一月，即屆收繭時期，時間殊為侷促。期前又不得不將各項推進工作，作充份之準備。故中蠶公司當局與江浙兩省蠶絲業代表及各絲商等，連日正積極研究具體意見，以便於本年度產銷計劃經政院通一過後，即可呈請政院核定，配合施行。　　據悉：本年度蠶絲之生產計劃一，總目標為七萬至八萬担之譜。此中廣東區佔一萬四五千担，四川區佔一萬七八午擔，江浙兩區佔三萬五千至四萬祖。該項生產總額中，將由政府按生產成本，收講三萬擔，以供輸出，易取外匯之用。至本年度蠶絲成本之計算，係以一擔　合四擔米之比價計算。（云年為一與三之比，戰前為一與五之經經。）目的體卹蠶農，增加生產。又查戰前全國生絲之生產量，年達二七八萬擔。是則本年度計劃中之生產量，尚不足戰前之半數。惟絲業界人士觀察：如物價平穏，國內秩序恢復，運輸暢通後，則三年內即可恢復戰前之生產量云。　　絲價高漲　三種原因　　〔本報訊〕本市絲價，近日追隨百物之後，步步高漲。記者昨特趨訪某關係當局，探詢生絲步漲原因。渠稱：一般物價之騰漲，及通貨泛濫，固屬主因。惟就生絲本身而論：（一）因戰後生絲產量减少。按戰前江浙　省之產量，速土絲在內，年達十萬担。而目前產量，年僅三萬五千担，約為戰前產量三分之一。（二）本市存絲，可資在市面週轉者，目前不過三千担。而戰前則經常保持存量在七八千担之講。目前存底旣薄，偶遇市價波動，往往形成供不應求之局面。（三）近來市面人造絲缺貨，而人造絲向為各織綢廠用為生絲之替代品，人造絲旣缺貨，無形又增加生絲之需要量。凡此種種，咸足以促成生絲高漲云。堯樂博士發展　津新間貿易　　〔本報天津十四日電〕蕘樂博士頃已在津着手恢復天津新疆間之貿易，用以貨易貨原則，輸出新省土產礦產，自津輸往棉織品等。按津新貿易係中斷於戰前綏新汽車公司之停業，迄今己達十餘年。東北大豆起運　　〔本報瀋陽十五日電〕東北大豆出口，由中信局經辦者已有九千噸。自秦皇島起運出口，內五千噸運荷蘭，四千噸遝滬，受政院委託運日交換工業材料之首批大豆三千噸，將由營口起運，營口現已開港商船日見活躍矣。贛省行擴墊茶貸　　〔本報南昌十五日電〕全國茶貸，四聯已決定二八〇億，由當地農行治貸。全國茶產總計十九萬七千祖，其中贛產有浮梁紅茶五千担，婺源八千担，贛東三千担，富紅八千擔，贛省行決先墊撥七億貸放。　　來函　　逕啓者：四月下四日貴報刋載海味北貨桂圓三業，拒絕南貨號進貨，新聞一則，查與事實不符。綠海味北貨桂圓三業前以各會員售與本街貨物，其介款期漫無標準，因與南貨業代表龔靜岩，程東屏等協議，訂為一六對帳，二七送銀，三八發鄧期票，使南貨號講妥貨物後，尚有遲介貨款餘地。自二月六月實行以來，相安無事。四業間業務亦賴以步入正軌。最近因南貨業公會突然違反已成事實，單面自訂「貨到十天票面」辦法，三業以目前銀根奇緊，利息高昂，實難辦到，爰暫定售與南貨號貨款，改為現款交易，（拆兌，桂圓，檀香，熟貨，茶食四業，仍照原辦法放賬，）以避免意外損失。如南貨業能具體表示，仍照原辦法付款，當可恢復成規，並無拒絕南貨號購貨之事。至於影響已定物價一節，更屬

<p>春秋「約翰·克利斯朶夫」  李文勳　「…人呀！你要支持你自己！」　——Roman　Rorand　　（一）　　當我很年輕的日子，眼睛發亮而看不見思想和山水，像是在一個錦繡的戲院裏，懷着焦灼和喜悅注視着奧妙的舞台。希望那緋色的幕布豁然開啓，那裏即將展開一個世界，一片遠景，一束芳香，又像一隻初航的海船，扯起作爲生命標籤的白帆，在花束和歌聲中解纜，從一個湫隘的碼頭駛向明亮的遠海，對於生命中最初昇起的一些夢幻的蜃樓和圖片，諸如一個神秘的港灣，一座明媚鄉城，一個繁盛節塲，或者是一片鮮花遍野的島嶼，一個燈燭輝煌的夜會、付與殷切的盼待。　　但那又無非是一點神話和寓言，生命是一組連續的死亡和復活，跳過一部樂章必須經歷的快活音符，爲的要引向一個莊嚴的尾聲，整個人生，也都如一部樂曲所表示的辛苦歷程，從搖籃到墳墓，從寗警的啼泣到戀愛的喜悅，從喜悅的愛情到兩性的吿成，從兩性的告成到勇敢的創業，從勇敢的創業到花葉繽紛，淚與笑，生和死，愛情相憎恨，歡樂和痛苦，一直到死，像夕陽似的展現了最後的甜寗的歸去，有着無限惜別的悲凉，這是一個人底艱苦歷程，一切爲了生命，一切爲了完成，在暴風雨摧殘下的一個花園，那些花樹以嚴肅的姿勢接受了季節的戰鬥，即使凋謝了，但決不折倒。　　「人呀！你要支持你自己」！　　（二）　　在黑茫茫的海上，我是一隻很破爛很疲倦的小船，遠處晚霧裏明亮着明滅的燈火，像人間的一些嘲笑和揶揄，海風帶着巨大的威勢撲打着我，我底愛情的明角已經熄滅，我底桅桿仍舊堅定的站立，白帆鼓滿了大風發出獵　的歌聲，像一面人底戰鬥的大旗。　　「人呀！你必須支持你自己」！　　經過了暴風的鞭打，大雨傾盆而下，夾雜着鳴雷的轟擊和電光的掃射，一切聲童都被壓倒，白帆被暴雨激烈的捶打，船艙裏已經有了蓄水，那紫色的閃電照明了白帆像海燕般在黑夜裏翱翔，在洶湧的大浪中逆風挺進，當船身在迷途的海上顚簸，突然發出支裂的巨響，在那即將傾覆的瞬間，以最大的力强和勇敢把穩了舵，扶直方向，從礁石與沙灘中間奔瀉而來，從海浪與暴雨夾攻之下衝湧而來。　　「人呀！你要征服他，征服牠」！　　最後駛入一個曲折的港灣，好比是一個生命的荒涼的驛站，一個窮乏的，慘淡的春天，我不相信春天有這麼寂寞，這麼寒冷，童年時所夢想的美好的，美好的日子，原來是這麼一塲風雨和駭浪。　　孤獨！孤獨！我祗有一個人，祗有一個我，像晚年的巴爾扎克所說宛如一個悲哀的肓女、望着沒有陽光的好天氣。　　在黑暗中，在頹廢中，和自己的思想低低的交談……　　（三）　　這時候，我忽然看見約翰，克利斯朶夫—這個野獸般的巨人闖入了我底居屋，他以海浪般的嘩笑跟我招呼，以闊大多毛的手掌和我握乎帶來一股不可抗拒的力量，有一團原始的，光明的氣息，他底全身像有一種不可搖撼的意志，一種超特的姿勢，他底微微顫動的嘴唇却顯示着仕慈，好像在說：「除了善良以外，我不知道什麼是超越的標誌」。　　他開始訴說他底可怕的身世，像情人底一雙溫愛的小手，拉着我走向廣大的世界，在他底世界裏經歷了多少暗澹的光陰，跟他肩比肩的走在意大利蔚藍的天空下面，在萊茵河底大月亮下面哭泣着我們底人生，我們底痛苦的戰鬥遭遇，從友誼到戀愛、戀愛到情慾，眞理和愛情，藝術和創造，痛苦和歡樂。　　在寂寞長途，照亮了我底生命和我底歌，使我恢復了寧靜，堅定和勇敢——克利斯朶夫，成爲漫漫長夜的一盞明燈，生命底一點支持和聲援，力量和意志的優美的象徵，以莊嚴的人底名義　給我們以火把和長矛，呌我們怎樣征服生命，怎樣從所有空隙裏吸取生命底强烈的氣息，正視人間的苦難，然後放聲大笑！　　（四）　　但是我畢竟敗北了，每次戰敗回來，克利斯朶夫總像工個不速之客來到我底面前，他每次君臨都有一種新的風貌，撫摩着我癥結在心底的纍纍無告的創傷，給我換上新的盔甲和戰馬，戴上荆棘編成的冠冕，把我打扮得像一個偉岸的騎士，然後給我繫起一再飄折的戰鬥的大旗，隆重的，嘆息般的向我說：　　「人呀！你要支持你自己，必須支持你自己，祖要有一雙忠實的眼睛與你一同哭泣，就値得你爲生命而受苦……」　　我像孩子般的倒在他底懷裏，含淚的訴說着我底靑春的悲哀，我底辛酸的經歷。　　「神呵」我仰起含淚的雙目，顫抖着說：「我祗有一個人，祗有一個我，我連一個軍隊也沒有。」　　「不！不！你決不止一個人」神借着克利斯朵夫斬釘截鐵的說：「而且你也不是你底，你是我底一個聲音，一條臂膀，替我揚起聲音來就是，替我掄起鞭子來就是，即使聲音啞子，臂膀折了，我始終這樣站着、我用了你以外的人們底聲音和臂膀戰鬥着，即使戰敗了，也是屬於那決不敗北的軍隊的」。　　「假使失掉了我底生命呢」　　「點火在別的生命上就是」　　我底全身烈熖似的燃燒起來，緊緊的擁抱着他，　　神呵！你何其偉大，我將在你底名義下從事耕耘，進行戰鬥，是的，生命是火，火是不會滅的，有石在、有火種在，　　神呵！在歡樂的火熖翻飛之中，在燃燒的荆棘榛莽之中，你底身體和聲音巳成了崇高的塑像，永遠活在我底心上。　　神呵！你底箴言成了這長夜的明燈，由於你底無私的照耀，正義即將伸張，眞理即將顯現，生命發出光輝。　　你將復活，你將再生，一切祗是一顆心，日與夜交融以後水乳般的微笑、和諧是愛憎結合起來的理想的配偶，我將謳歌生着兩大翅翼的神明，謳歌生命，頌滿死亡！　　聽！「Die　Neunte　Symphonie」龐大的交響已在全世界昇起：　　「四海之內，皆是兄弟！看你底柔翼翱翔大家都是自然的心胸！且飲那快樂千鐘」。（註）　　（註）「第九交響曲」底中譯名句，悲多汶作品編號第一二五，乃樂聖晚年至高無上的傑作第四樂章「歡樂頌歌」原詩係德國大詩人席勒所作，在重慶有顧一樵先生底課詞、陳立夫先生底題簽，靑木關國立音樂院出版。老者外一章  林博秀　　春天來了，老者枯黃的臉皮又給冬神加上幾條縐紋，他佇立在那間破陋的草屋底門限上，放眼出野上被雨水潤濕了肥沃的泥土；泥面枯萎的草莖，又悄悄地發靑了。南去的燕子雙雙翱翔在半空中，麻斑雀這邊飛飛那邊歇歇，頭皮地呌出春天的聲童。村童們趕着竹馬，滑　的泥徑並不削减他們的興致。大地似乎整個活躍起來，惟有老者憂戚地立　在那裏。　　他們的阿保被徵去當兵了，隔年，他的媳婦也轉嫁了，那頭瘦弱的水牛生病死了，幾畝田擺在他的而前却沒有氣力去耕墾。他過着孤伶的生活，托何一個時辰都可以看見那張殘黃的滿刻下縐紋的臉皮上。敷抹了一層慍怒的色彩，他詛咒戰爭的殘忍，更相信一代不如一代，在他的腦　裏找不出政治的觀念，也找不出國家的意識，他祗懂得是誰把他的兒子抓去當兵打仗，是誰護去他生活的資源。　　現在，老者疲倦了，他慢慢地由門外走進屋裏，無力地往坑床上一躺……蜘蛛的絲網遍織在屋頂的四周，往日發光的桌椅，因爲敷上一層塵埃，所以顯得十分啞澀。天色漸漸晦黑，　角那些小窟窿發出一種尖銳的呌聲，棕黑色的小動物，毫不驚忌自大地從這邊溜到那邊。黑夜到來時，四周死一樣的嚴肅，此處是人間的地獄呢還是陰間的地獄呢？　　「阿保不再回來了；除非光明到來的一天」——他說。　　疲倦　　手腕漸漸地痠軟下來，字形跟着走了樣子。眼皮欲瞌欲睜，朦朦朧朧看見紙上一個個字，迅速地在光亮與鳥暗之中來回溜闖着。腦壳不舒適地，有時昏漲有時迷惑更有時是懵懂的，脊樑由直，斜，曲而倚靠在書桌的邊緣。平日忌怕夜貓呌春，現在聽來却毫不在意，相反的，對於我彷彿是一支催眼曲，一聲聲尖銳的凡珴琳的尾音。　　剛才我停留在思想的幽境上，我貪婪地舐着先知者智慧者的墨跡；現在我的軀體死去了，睡魔携着我的靈魂，環遊玄奧的夢底國土，我失去人間可愛寶貴的光亮，也失去理智的作用力，聽任夢魔各種擺佈……。　　過了一段時期醒來了，夢魔把自由還給我，於是眼兒睜開；感覺到一陣酸澀。想一望給左手壓住的那張紙，發覺到掉下來的那支鋼筆，恰好途在紙的中央，靑藍色的派克墨水化了開來像伸夏天空淡一抹雲彩。　　夜深了，夜深了，深夜催促我，呌我休憇。可是，我却要硬着性兒，苦待到明天。魯迦米肖像  達維達維（J.L.David　17448-1820）最初祗喜歡畫些關於希臘神話的東西，後來旅行到羅馬，乃靜心硏究米格朗琪羅和辣斐耳的作品，融會了兩大家的精結，遂走入了「古典」之門。製作莊重典雅，理智化的繪畫。　　後半生幾乎全爲拿破崙製作歌功頌德的畫，當拿破嵩失敗後，他也同樣被放逐于國外，遁跡白耳義的一個小城市裏，照常製作，門徒亦甚多。儘管他的政治路綫是走錯了，但，他的藝術仍是成功的。在近代美術史中佔有極光榮的一頁。（獅）祝福  蘇汎　　讓旗幟永遠飄揚，讓火炬永遠閃亮，也讓從我們年靑的喉嚨裏迸發出來的歌聲，永不止歇。　　一顆星子迸落了，再讓另一顆星子燃起，朋友，當我們迸發出微弱的火花之後，也該讓我們靜靜地休息。　　於是再讓我們看到第二顆星予在暗夜裏閃爍。　　用生命換取榮耀，用犧牲換取愛情，用淚珠滋潤生命的花朶，用貧窮代替驕傲，用鮮紅的血漿去滋乳我們貧血的人。民，雖然我們也那麼枯黃　　厚厚的雪花落在春大·鮮　的花朶開在未來，爲一個飄渺的夢幻，年靑的朋友，讓我們慷慨地透支出我們所有的熱情。　　爲生命永遠歌唱，爲夢幻虔誠地祈禱，爲新的理想，讓我們堅決地走向遠方……　　當寒流襲擊着大地時，朋友，更需要珍重啊！　　（三·廿·重慶夏壩）大仲嗎二三事  楊實　　「三劍客」作者大仲馬曾屢次鄭重宣稱決不結婚，他的兩位情人用盡了方法都沒有說服他，她偶然見用最多的錢購得了大仲馬的一堆債務。當時在法國欠債不還是要坐牢的，她於是派人向他警告道：「結婚呢？還是坐牢。」他痛苦的考慮了兩天後選擇了前者，結娟了事。　　他相當窮，當他的第一本劇本在巴黎上演時，沒有領帶讓他帶去赴劇院，他曾用一塊紙板剪出一條領帶來代上。　　在用筆和稿紙上他有奇怪的脾氣，寫小說必須用藍色紙；寫詩歌就用黃色紙和另一套文具；寫散文非用玫瑰色的信箋不寫。從不用藍墨水，劇本不能坐着寫，定要臥靠着沙發偏哼偏寫。　　當他遍遊歐洲時在驛車上或馬背上仍然在寫作，並且常在同一時間裏他在寫五種小說；這樣他好像很忙，其實他很有閒情，生平用刀和手槍和人作過二十次以上的決鬥呢！一寸山河一寸血318  葉勁風　　「吿訴你……我並不畏怯你們這一套；慢說你這三四塊材料，再加上兩三倍，我也有力量拒絕你們。可是你得聽眞！我可以同你去，那是由於害怕彼此誤會，反把正事躭誤了，你明白嗎？」　　「我明白也沒有用，我們都是受了命令來的。因爲來人並非中村小姐自己，我們不能不照計劃行事。如有誤會，如有得罪，到了地點自然有人陪話。我們的舉動，得請閣下原諒。……走罷！」　　「原諒的話，用不着說了。」鶴見神情上已表現了原諒的實際、臉上怒氣巳退，賸下的只是憂愁，「你得知道中付小姐爲什麼不親自前來？—她已經失踪了！一我們現在正進行探尋她的　　。」　　「吹」！那人嘆息之中，　着無限惶惑，一還是得請閣下，把經過的情形，對敝首領詳細說明，省却誤會！」那人說畢，分外謙虛起來；一個鞠躬之後，即轉身前導。　　出了公園，只見那人撅嘴輕輕噓了一下，即有一部黑色巨型轎車，從一行停着的的汽車中，開了過來。鶴見因彼那「0915」的數字、攪得有些神經過敏，便着着實實把這汽車號礪，瞧了又瞧，記了又記，備作將來探查的綫索。　　「請二位上車。」那人恭敬之中，帶着催促的神情。　　「二位，」當然指着鶴見和正岩。鶴見一聽這「二位」兩字，剛想回身去瞧正岩，只見正岩已緊緊貼在他身後站着。在這一瞥之門，鶴見同時看到四五礪外，沿公園門外一帶，至少有十幾個各別打扮，身份不同的人，都神色緊張？注意着自已。從鹤見的經騐看，知道這些人，都是來人一黨，担任　戒備職務。　　「我還有一個請託，」鶴見護正岩上了車，指着高矗的老匯中，對那白色西服的人說，「我們有一部汽車，停在那座紅磚高屋門口，架駛員是個日本人，是一部黑色的出差汽車，請你派一位同志，給那車夫五圓錢，就說我們不用他的車了。」鶴見這一個要求，展示了坦白，並且也顯明自己十分漂亮。似的。「請示汽車的號碼。」那人十分謹愼　　鶴見踏上了汽車，一面吿訴那人，「不記得了——只找到日本車夫就行。」說着，就鑚進了汽車。　　就在這上車坐下的一霎眼間，鶴見已　機遞了暗號，呌正岩留意。這，無非是呌正岩留心這部汽車的行程路綫，作爲將來參攷的意思。殊不知這一着，實際上有些用不到；因二人上車坐定之後，那白色西裝的人，也隨着進了車廂，坐在鶴見身旁，只說了「得罪」二字，鶴見和正岩，已覺支持不住，早已頭暈腦悶，漸灞昏睡過去了。　　等到鶴見淸醒轉來的時候，却發見自己坐在一間屋子裏。希望之於絕望  鳴濤　　在我們這個國度裘，涉世不深的「小犢」兒們，還很天眞的存着幻想，希望着一個美麗的將來。但是一般有二十五年生活經騐的人，却很少如此。經騐吿訴他們說，除非到了手的東西，你才能够把它常作是「你的」看待；否則，即使它且備了屬於你的可能性，還不是一樣的水中月亮鏡中花，虛無飄渺得很。　　我們常常是希望了，馬上又失望了，隨後緊接着的是死滅一樣的絕望。這是一個可悲的生長過程，因爲從開始起，人們就不曾意料到它有任何好的結果。　　窮家小戶的父母們，被推倒在貧窮的泥淖裏，上天罰他們一個個接連不斷的生產孩子，而他們終於生了，但是又無可避免的病了，凍了，餓了，隨後仍然是踵接着悽凉的死亡，這也是一個可悲的生長過程，和「希望」之成「絕望」，同樣的呌人感到顫慄。　　我們卑微，即使在思想的領域裏，也一樣地顯得寒傖。所需要的，所希望的，即使以猶太人的度邊來說、也不會責備我們過份的。「生存·溫飽·發展」這三者，難這說還有那一點是不應該。我們要的自己的一切言行，像是一個有腦筋的人求作爲，而不是聽命於一個瓜瓤心子的南瓜腦袋。這點做人的基本權利，請問除了瘋狗以外，是否還會有「人」出來執筆批駁「礙難照准」。　　也許，有人曾經希望過席捲天下鈔票，囊括宇宙黃金；也許，有人打過全世界的主意，做過家天下的好夢；也許，有人曾經企求升官發財，到處鑚營，想騎在別人的頭上，一步三跳的飛黃騰達起來；假如他們失望、我認爲是應該的，因爲那本來就是無法實現的奔望，與希望根本不同。而我們這渺乎其小的一羣，只希望活得「人」而不「畜」化；只希望活得「主」化而不「奴」化；在社會這面鏡子裏，看得見自己堅起的脊樑就滿足了，請問「大爺們」還有什麼理由呌我們淪於絕望。自由談告小艾德里先生  吳蜀江　　我不是長他人志氣，滅自已威風。我看了現任英國首相艾德里的獨子，服務藍烟囱輪船公司卡爾許斯的一段新聞，我眞的有些骨鯁在喉，不吐不快。　　一個堂堂現任首相的兒子，滿身油膩骯髒，活像工人，學徒，這已够瞧的了，聽到新聞記者表達來意以後，他頗顯出些怕羞的樣子，這是多麼純潔，天眞。　　新聞記者伸出手來想跟他握別，他卻把手縮了回去，伸開粗大的手掌給人看，他說：「太髒了」。這不是一個極大的諷刺嗎？　　筆者最憧憬的是，他惋惜卡爾斯許輪星期一就要離滬，僅餘的一天星期日，却又剛巧換到値班工作，眼見得要錯過遊覽上海的機會。　　遊覽上海—筆者在這裏吿訴你，不遊也罷！上海，你的同志太少了，你的同志，除非碼頭上的小工、眞正的勞力者：那些豐衣足食的「公子哥兒」羣裹，恐怕沒有你的同志。就是稍有幾個具錢的「小開」，誰不是裝扮得「花雅鴣」兒似的。　　衣服麗都，脂香扮氣，這應該是你的本來面目，但是你不！　　你不忘情上海，我也不憚辭費，想和你傾談幾句：　　上海的表面，雖然有巍峨大樓，可是內幕是枯澀得你意想不到的枯澀。巧取，豪奪，操縱，奸詐，淫糜，支持了上海的存在與繁榮。　　你大忠於職守了。你難得到全世界聞名的上海，却沒有機會掀開上海人的面紗，看一個眞切。　　小艾德里先生！你下次再來到上海，你得洗凈了你那變粗而且　的手，還得要換上一身高貴的西裝，不然，恐怕祗有新聞記者眼裏有你，若是碰到別人，謹防他們把你當作是一個外國「癟三」呢。「鷄蛋與我」　美國的最銷書　現已攝製電影  碧　　近年來美國的出版界，有兩本最銷書，其一就是盡人皆知的「隨風而去」，另一本則爲現正喧騰的「鷄蛋與我」。前者已經攝成電影，後者也已由環球國際公司購得攝製權，着手開拍了。　　奇怪的是，這兩本最銷書的作者，都是女子，大槪女子心細，觀察力特別精密，小說的可貴原在乎眞實細膩，所以女子寫來，更覺出色了。　　「鷄蛋與我」的故事極平凡，其中叙述一個少女愛上了一個農畜家，因此結婚之後，他們就遠離城市，在一個荒僻的農塲裏開始了新生活。那少女本來並不是一個「農家」，現在却負起了養鷄·養豬·養半·養羊的大任·這一些她都是一種新奇的工作。又加上遠處荒僻，一切都市中的便利設備都付　如，女主人一朝置身其間，不但困難，而且厭煩，但最後她終於在這自然的田園生活中找到了樂趣，反而不願再回到文明的都市中去了。　　「鷄蛋與我」的作者蓓蒂麥克唐諾，這本著作不但使她成名，也帶給了她無限的財富。「最銷書」的版稅不算，單只電影攝　權，她就賣了廿五萬元美金。本片將由克勞黛考爾白和茀萊特麥克茂萊主演，正像「隨風而去」中的白脫拉恰合克拉克蓋博一樣。克勞黛考爾白詞養雛鷄中日球隊可以比賽麼？  彤　　美國巳和日本比賽，　我們爲什麼不可以？　　將來在麥帥訓練之下的日本足球隊，棒球隊，如若來上海挑戰的話，無疑地我們是應愼重其事，來和他們一決雌雄。——至少我個人的意見以爲如此·　　運動原是不分國籍，沒有階級的。素爲美國人鄙視的有色人種——黑人，不是被當局者選拔爲國手，來代表美國參加世界運動會嗎？就在最近，美國駐日佔領軍，和日本當地的棒球隊，不是也曾舉行過比寗嗎？　　日本民族性，固然是陰險奸滑，胸襟窄狹，但人民富有研究性，和能耐勞苦幹，敬上服從，米始不可爲我們的榜樣。　　捧球是一向被美國譽爲國技，（National　Game）每遇球賽，傾巷往觀，可是此次美軍竟遭敵手，雖然這一次比賽，不足以代表國際性，但究竟棒球在美國西點陸軍大學中，是普遍發達，人材輩出的，所以佔領軍中，一定也不乏佳手，而事實上這次是失敗了。由此可以證明日本的「野球」遝動，造詣是相當深邃的。其實，像他們那樣，「只問耕耘，不問收穫」的不懈努力，到底總是有價値的。——由運動器具廠不斷供應器械、由政府爲後盾，向學校及民間竭力推動，由專家來辦專關棒球的硏突性刋物，這種「勞民傷財」的舉動，難道日本人眞的蠢嗎？　　日本在人家庇護之下，正在努力復興，我由衷地希望日本能有球隊來滬，與我國球員一爭短長。「繆斌」矣罵  雲間　　繆斌字丕丞，於十九年任蘇省民政廳長，年少氣盛。政治專務外表，不求實際。時省主席爲鈕公惕，處處受其掣肘，鈕公固大量海涵，而時論頗不平之。翌年繆爲母稱觴於无錫原籍，部屬咸以金寿星，金王母進呈，收括甚巨。科長孫祖蒸等，居間賄賣縣長局長缺，有一二三四五六之　。蓋以缺之肥瘠，分一千元二千元之等差耳。繆且爲標榜治績，發行「明日江蘇」刋物。某次紀念週，時省府秘書長葉公楚傖演講，謂：昔有一欠債者，人每向之索欠，輒諉以明日，遷延復遷延，至大除夕，而猶以明日對，索债者大怒，卒飽以老拳。今繆廳長以「明日江蘇」，為刷新蘇省政治之期待。余深恐蹈欠債者之覆識，若終無以好之政績表現，不將爲蘇省三千萬人民，羣飽我儕以老拳乎？前輩直言無忌，使繆無地自容，亦繆自取之乎？或曰繆卒爲奸逆，葉公已早燭其微矣。（按繆已伏法）病孩的活·死  報童　　一位最「天才」的「新聞學家」給新聞的一個定義是人咬狗而不是狗咬人，這倒是最最合乎市民心理釣。雙胞胎的怪嬰剛動動　不久，這幾天，一個男孩的死而復活，活而復死的新聞又給社會爭傳、認爲奇聞了。　　自然，更嚴重的事情正在面臨，一個孩子的夭亡在這社會裏是不會怎樣被注意的。二千個童屍一次的火葬，亦當然尋常得很　，不但不會引起人們的興趣，恐怕連我們的醫事當局也漠然的吧。　　然而，奇怪的是有一個小靈魂，會在它最後的空間與時間　活動起來，也幸而普善山莊的扛伕能够發現，於是在千萬次的漠然中得到一次注意，於是在千萬次的缺乏籍療中，這個小靈魂得到它在人世間最大也最後的一次救護了。　　不過人們的興趣是並不在它能被救，而在它的死後復活。現在經過一晝夜的悉心治療，又復夭亡，好心的人嘆息一聲，什麼事情都看做是一幕戲的人，也許會感到太少太不够剌激吧。　　然則，由這一個孩子的死而復活的事件裏，我們可以看到一個多麼嚴重的問題。我們的社會對於孩子實在太輕視，太少關護了。孩子們像在生命的夾縫莫生長的，生前旣鮮愛護，病中亦未能得到充分治療，不應該死而終於死去，應該醫療沒有得到良好的醫療，於是普善山莊能有二千個童屍一次收葬的紀錄，而其中也竟有男孩會死而復活，活而復死了。　　我們希望因爲這事件，社會人士能够在這事件後面看出問題的所在來，孩子的復活是給社會的一個諷刺，孩子的活而復死，何嘗不可認爲是小　魂們對世問最後的控訴。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「5111、5271……」走了五十碼路左右，吹熟的口哨又從老祝的嘴曆裏響了起來。　　一遍兩遍……　　「不好聽，祝伯伯，老是這幾句！」緋緋輕輕地說，好像要顧全老祝的面子似的。　　老祝禁不住笑了。　　可是祗笑了一笑他就笑不下去了，他的聽覺已吿訴他前面的路上正有不少的車輛和人在行動。一這消息難道別人也知道了嗎？」他的希望漸漸動搖了。　　跟着後面也傳來了車聲和人語。　　「他媽的！怎麼全知道了？」蘭的堂兄豐德很忿懣地說。　　老祝忽然噗哧一笑。　　「笑什麼？祝先生。」間的堂兄有些愕然。　　「我笑　們在機關雲工作的人都有一種同樣的誤解，以為政府一切措置總是可以瞞過老百姓的。」祝兆年慨乎言之地說：「待到老百姓一知道，他們又大驚小怪地責怨什麼人走漏了消息。其實他們爲什麼時常要瞞過老百姓呢？爲什麼不能辦得好一些，爽快全部公開呢？余光生，請你別見怪！就把你們湘桂鐵路今天晚上這個辦法來說，根本也極可笑的！爲什麼開往柳州去的火車不開進車站來讓客人好好地上車呢？客人太多，火車太少這是不錯的。然無為什麼要鬼鬼崇的停在二塘，單讓有辦法有路道的人上去呢？這一點根本就不通了還要奇怪老百姓爲什麼也知道二塘有火車。你想，余先生，豈不教人發笑？」（四五）</p>

<h3>Common Policy Guidelines of the Three Parties Officially Announced by the National Government Today; List of Government Commissioners to Be Announced Followed by Assumption of Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The date for the announcement of the common policy guidelines of the three parties has not yet been finalized as of tonight. Wu Dingchang, the Chief Secretary, advocates for the announcement to be made by the National Government on April 18th, as that day marks the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in Nanjing. He believes it would be more meaningful if the policy guidelines and the list of government commissioners were announced on that day. However, the final decision awaits the President's review.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The common policy guidelines have been finalized. The previously reported twelve articles remain largely unchanged. However, a preamble has been added to the articles decided upon during the meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 5 PM on the 15th. The general idea is as follows: In order to implement constitutional government and promote democracy, the National Government has been seeking to invite individuals from various parties and social elites to jointly participate in the government since the Political Consultative Conference. After continuous efforts, an agreement has been reached with representatives from various parties regarding the policy guidelines of the reorganized government, which has been approved by the Central Standing Committees of the three parties and is now ready for implementation. The contents of the twelve articles are hereby announced as follows: (Note: The original twelve articles are largely consistent with what this newspaper published last month. The main points are summarized as follows:) (1) The reorganized National Government will continue to use the Principles of Peaceful National Reconstruction as its policy guideline, with various parties and social elites jointly responsible. (2) The principles of political democratization and the nationalization of the military will serve as the foundation for cooperation among various parties. Under this joint cooperation, political progress and national stability will be pursued. (3) If the Chinese Communist Party is willing to pursue peace, the government will seek domestic peace through political means after railway transportation is restored. (4) Provincial and municipal councils should make every effort to involve members of various parties, and provincial and municipal governments should also make every effort to involve members of various parties. Furthermore, the revised Article 11 is as follows: "All foreign debts incurred in the future shall be specifically designated for stabilizing and improving people's livelihoods and for production and construction."</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] A meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence at 5:30 PM on the 15th to finalize the common policy guidelines. Government representatives present included Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, and Sun Ke; representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party included Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian; and representatives from the Youth Party included Chen Qitian and Zuo Shunsheng. After making slight revisions to the content, it was decided that each party would prepare a copy and exchange them via mail on the 16th. The Kuomintang will hold a Central Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 16th to approve the guidelines. Afterwards, the Chairman will convene representatives from various parties and social elites for a final review, which will also serve as a signing ceremony. The lists of government commissioners from the three parties and social elites will be submitted at the same time. After the National Government announces the lists, the new government commissioners will be sworn in and form the new government. The first session of the National Government Committee will be convened on the same day to discuss the reorganization of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The candidates for government commissioners from social elites are as follows: Mo Dehui, Hu Shi, Zhang Shizhao, and Wang Yunwu. However, if Hu Shi firmly declines the position, or if Wang Yunwu continues to hold a ministerial position in the Executive Yuan, Chen Guangfu will succeed him. The above five individuals have been agreed upon by all parties. It has also been decided that there will be five political affairs committee members, with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party each nominating two members. The social elite representative is Miao Yuntai.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] Jiang Yuntian recently told reporters that the list of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party for the Government Committee has been largely finalized.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Resolutions in Plenary Session; Recovery of Government Shares in the "Little Four" Banks; Draft Banking Law to Be Further Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 321st regular session at 9:30 AM on the 15th, chaired by President Sun. The session discussed various proposals, mostly related to economic affairs, including the recovery of government shares in the "Little Four" Banks and the organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission. Regarding the four banks—China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank—these were not originally national banks. Prior to the War of Resistance, due to a run on the banks, the government, in order to stabilize the financial situation, invested over ten million in government shares (wartime legal tender), accounting for about 80% of the total shares of the "Little Four" Banks. However, over the years, these banks have largely failed to remit government dividends and earnings to the national treasury. The Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan previously resolved at the 40th joint session of the Fourth Session that the government shares in these banks should be recovered based on the net value of each bank's assets minus liabilities. When the proposal was presented at the regular session on the 15th, while some committee members such as Sun Jiulu advocated for conditional recovery, the majority voted in favor of immediate recovery in order to delineate public and private boundaries and establish a national banking system. Zhang Zhaoyuan traced the history of government investment in the "Little Four" Banks and analyzed the proportion of government shares, noting that the government's initial investment of over ten million would be worth over a hundred billion at current currency values, while the government's annual revenue is only 6.5 million, just reaching pre-war levels, with the profits being pocketed by those in charge, causing a great loss to the nation. Wei Tingsheng also believed that from a financial perspective, the government's investment was not worthwhile and that it would be better to sell the shares to make up for the national budget deficit rather than allow a few people to profit. Li Qingchen did not advocate for the recovery of government shares but suggested that the government purchase the relatively small number of commercial shares, turning the "Little Four" Banks into national banks. In the final vote, with over eighty members present, seventy-two voted in favor, passing the resolution that the government shares in the "Little Four" Banks should be recovered based on net value, with the specific procedures to be drafted by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies. The session then discussed the proposal by Committee Member Mei Shuzeng and thirty-eight others to sell the government shares withdrawn from the "Little Four" Banks at a publicly assessed value based on the total existing assets. The proposed method was to have the process overseen by supervisory agencies and to distribute the shares proportionally between government and commercial interests for public sale, with the names of the purchasers disclosed. Personnel handling the case and managing the "Little Four" Banks would be prohibited from purchasing the shares to avoid suspicion. During the discussion, many legislators believed that the implementation would involve too many complications and would not be easy to handle. It was resolved to pass the principle and send it to the government for adoption and implementation, along with the previous case. Another important item on the agenda was the organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission. After Economic Committee Chairman Lou Tongsun explained the review process, Committee Members Jian Guansan and others immediately stood up to oppose the proposal, arguing that this redundant agency was unnecessary, as the National Economic Commission would have too many members and excessively broad powers, without any participation from people's representatives. Since there was already an Executive Yuan Council, there seemed to be no need to establish another agency. Zhong Tianxin and others believed that under the current economic conditions, the establishment of this agency was necessary and that its powers would not necessarily overlap with those of the Executive Yuan Council. Lou Tongsun pointed out that the National Economic Commission would be an "economic advisory body" focused on research and coordination of economic affairs, and that it would be better to have such an agency than not to have one. It was resolved to refer the matter to the Finance, Economic, and Legal Committees for further review of the content. The session adjourned at around 3 PM. Because important matters such as the draft Banking Law and the detailed rules for the election and recall of National Assembly delegates were still pending discussion, it was resolved to hold the 322nd regular session on the 17th to continue the deliberations.</p>
<h3>Increase Education Funding; Establish More Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 15th, after the reporting items, the following were discussed: (1) The Finance Committee, together with the Criminal Law Committee, reported on the review of the draft amendment to the Mining Law, and it was resolved to pass it. (2) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee, reported on the re-examination and amendment of the draft Provincial Bank Regulations, and it was decided to approve it with minor amendments. (3) The Finance Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the review of the proposal by Committee Member Chen Anren and others, suggesting that the government increase education funding, establish more vocational schools to accommodate high school graduates who cannot enter universities, and establish more vocational schools to accommodate junior high school graduates who cannot continue their studies. It was resolved to approve the proposal based on the review opinions and send a letter to the competent authorities requesting them to pay attention to establishing more vocational schools within the possible scope when compiling the budget for the next fiscal year. High school graduates who have served in the military should be assigned to universities or preparatory classes according to their academic level, and those who have already entered universities should be given preferential treatment. Provincial governments should also be instructed to establish more vocational schools. (4) The Civil Law Committee, together with the Legal System Committee and the Economic Committee, reported on the review of the case regarding the repatriation of real estate mortgaged by overseas Chinese, and it was resolved to approve it based on the review opinions. According to the review opinions, the provisions of Articles 7 and 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation After Restoration are sufficient to address the issue of the redemption period and the requirement to redeem at the original price, so it does not seem necessary to formulate separate measures. (5) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee, reported on the re-examination of the proposal to have the government recover the government shares in China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank based on net value, and it was resolved to approve it based on the review opinions. The recovery of government shares will be handled by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies. (6) Committee Member Mei Shuzeng and others proposed that the government shares withdrawn from the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank should be sold at a publicly assessed value based on the total existing assets, and it was resolved to approve the principle and send it to the government for adoption and implementation together with the previous case. (7) The Criminal Law Committee, together with the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee, reported on the drafting of the Regulations on Penalties for Trading in Gold and Foreign Exchange, and it was approved with amendments. (8) The Economic Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the review of the draft organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission, and it was resolved to refer it back to the Economic, Finance, and Legal System Committees for further study and review of the content. (9) The Criminal Law Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the supplementary regulations for the disposal of property of traitors who die before trial, and it was resolved to amend Article 8 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.

<h3>He Hanwen Claims in Interrogation That China and Taiwan Are Inseparable</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] He Hanwen, the supervisor who recently returned from an investigation in Taiwan, told our reporter on the 15th that the situation in Taiwan has become stable, and he sincerely hopes that after the reorganization of the Taiwan Province, it can be on equal footing with other provinces of the country and embark on the path of democracy. He particularly emphasized that China cannot be separated from Taiwan, and Taiwan cannot be separated from China. He frequently mentioned the important position that Taiwan occupies in China's future construction and believes that "suppression should come before leniency, and leniency should be applied to suppression." He declined to make any announcements regarding the suppression part. In his report, he made several suggestions on the points that should be paid attention to in future administration. He believes that the main causes of this incident are: (1) The Japanese ruled Taiwan for more than fifty years, and what they usually promoted was the idea of ​​disdaining China. In addition, the authorities' facilities after the recovery of the island were not completely ideal, and the Taiwanese people changed from hope to disappointment, and finally caused a big wave of opposition. (2) The Japanese left some evil forces in Taiwan. (3) Too many mainlanders were employed by the Chief Executive's Office, which inevitably led to corruption, and Taiwanese people rarely had a chance to set foot in various agencies. (4) The public office and the monopoly system made it difficult for small and large businesses to survive. Mr. He believes he will assume the new position of Taiwan Supervisor. It is said that the new Supervisory Yuan Organizational Law has abolished the Supervisory Office system, so the Supervisory Office may not be set up again there. When asked by the reporter whether Chen Yi would come to Nanjing recently, Mr. He did not give a definite answer.</p>

<h3>Dalian's Takeover Still Pending; China and the Soviet Union Have Different Opinions on Fortification</h3>

Guests included Wu Dingchang, Chief of Staff of the National Government; Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance; Xu Kan, Director of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics; and Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank. Eighty-one representatives attended, including Du Yuesheng, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyin, Liu Hangchen, and Hu Zi'ang. The ceremony was grand. After the formalities, Li Fuxun, the director of the preparatory committee and chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech, stating: The organization of the Banking Federation did not start today. It was established as early as the 9th year of the Republic (1920), but was suspended in the 13th year (1924). Now it is being re-established. Banks in our country have a history of more than 50 years, but none have been able to gather the industry nationwide in one place as it does today. In the recent ten years, science and technology in various parts of the world have become more and more prosperous. Both economy and culture need cooperation and mutual assistance. Therefore, the organization of a national institution such as this Federation is urgent. In the future, we must make our best efforts in serving the society and developing our business.</p>
<p>Next, Secretary-General Li Ganzai reported on the preparatory process, and Chief of Staff Wu read President Chiang's congratulatory telegram. Leaders of various agencies who delivered training speeches included Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization; Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance; Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs; Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank; Shen Yi, Mayor of Nanjing; and Wang Xiaolai, Shanghai representative. Finally, member representative Hu Zi'ang delivered a reply speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The original text of Chairman Chiang's telegram is as follows: To the National Federation of Banking Associations: The rise and fall of the financial industry is closely related to the prosperity and decline of the national economy and the people's livelihood. This has become a established rule in both China and foreign countries. During the War of Resistance, the financial community in our country was able to unite and overcome difficulties, achieving the merits of stabilizing the precarious situation and supporting the War of Resistance. Looking back on the enthusiasm and perseverance of the past eight years, there is much to commend. Since the victory and recovery, in addition to the devastation caused by the enemy, and the decline of production, we still rely on the consistent sincerity of the national financial community to strive towards economic recovery. Although the difficulties and setbacks are even greater than during the war, we were still able to assist the government in implementing laws and regulations. Recently, the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Program and the issuance of treasury bonds and public bonds have been smoothly implemented, which is also due to the financial community's understanding of national policies and diligent implementation. Now that the General Assembly is held in Nanjing, gathering representatives from all over the country, and with good intentions and wise plans to help achieve national reconstruction, there will surely be profound thoughts and intentions. In the future, what is hoped is how the financial community should work together to gradually achieve a balance in the national budget, establish a solid foundation for currency reform, so as to stabilize the people's livelihood, increase production, and promote construction. I hope that you can express your excellent insights and gather collective wisdom to accomplish the mission that the financial community should bear for national reconstruction. Chiang Chung-cheng (蒋中正 印).</p>
<p>Chen Lifu: Hopes for Three Points</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's speech briefly stated: The establishment of the General Assembly is of great significance. We place great hopes on it: (1) Strengthen the organization so that it can generate the function of responding to the top and bottom, and can cooperate with the implementation of national policies; (2) Study financial issues so that the country can embark on the path of construction, establish financial institutions everywhere, and complete the financial framework; (3) Banking business should move towards developing agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun: Hopes to Create a New Atmosphere</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's speech briefly stated: The national organization of the banking industry is a pioneering undertaking, and its significance is significant. The history of banking in our country is less than 60 years, but it has achieved today's results, which is really the result of everyone's efforts. At present, according to the branches of banks approved by the Ministry of Finance, there are already more than 1,200 units. In the past, it made great contributions to supporting the War of Resistance. The progress and stability of banking business are symbols of the progress and stability of social economy. In the future, our goal is how to create a good atmosphere in the banking industry. First, we must encourage, persuade, and supervise each other among colleagues. We especially hope that the Association can take its responsibility. I hope that the banking industry can open up a new path in the future and add a new force to the country's economic construction.</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao: Describes Central Bank's Policies</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao's speech briefly stated: I am very happy to come and participate in the capacity of a colleague. China's economy, from before the war to the present, can be said to have gone through three turning points and three glorious records: that is, the gradual success of China's yarn factories and flour factories, which enabled domestic products to develop, this was the first era; the second was from the 16th year of the Republic (1927) to before the 24th year (1935), during which the deposits of domestic banks in China far exceeded those of foreign domestic banks; the third was today's economy after eight years of the War of Resistance, which is still gradually recovering. Although there are some difficulties at present, we are all confident that we can overcome them. Then Zhang declared three points of the Central Bank's business policy in the future: (1) Restore the standard of commercial ethics; (2) Integrate the interests of banks with the interests of the country and the interests of all the people; (3) We should focus on the domestic economy and restore the countryside.</p>
<p>Hu Zi'ang</p>
<p>Hu Zi'ang delivered a reply speech, putting forward four points: First, financial policy should not be biased towards how to control, but should lead to the path of production and construction; second, the financial industry and financiers hope to have a common banking law to follow, determine economic policies, and stabilize the financial market, so that the financial industry can meet the needs of national construction; third, the business of the financial industry itself should exist rationally within a legitimate scope in order to cooperate with the national economic policy; fourth, eliminate common misconceptions and do not think that the chaos in the financial market is a disturbance by financiers. The financial industry should closely cooperate with economic policy.</p>

<p>Incendiary Devices Used by Traitors Discovered</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chengdu, 15th] Recently, incendiary incidents have been discovered in Chengdu. The incendiary device is a circular cartridge.

<h3>Method for Repaying Pre-War Deposits</h3>

<h3>Jurisdiction Level of Appeals for Enemy and Puppet Property Cases</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Decides to Issue Orders for Compliance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] Since the enemy and puppet property handling agencies in various places have undergone many changes, the Executive Yuan has made the following decisions regarding the jurisdiction level of appeals for enemy and puppet property cases and issued orders for compliance: (1) For enemy and puppet property handling bureaus that still exist (Hebei, Tianjin-Beijing area, and Qingdao area of Shandong), the original plan will still be followed. (2) For areas where the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee and the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office coexist (Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area and Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee will still appeal to the Executive Yuan according to the original plan. As for those who disagree with the decisions of the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office, they can only request the competent Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee to review the case through the usual litigation method, because the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is only a business organization and not a government agency as defined by the Appeals Law, and no appeal can be filed against its decisions. (3) For areas where only the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is established (Wuhan area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office should request the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee to review the case through the usual petition method. (4) For areas where only the Office of the Special Commissioner for Handling and Receiving Enemy and Puppet Property is established (Henan area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Office of the Special Commissioner for Handling and Receiving Enemy and Puppet Property will appeal to the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite Issues of Overseas Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was established on April 16th, 1932, and this year marks its 15th anniversary. Since the establishment of overseas Chinese affairs agencies in the ninth year of Xianfeng's reign during the late Qing Dynasty, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has undergone nine changes, experiencing a sea of changes.</p>
<p>The commission was born on the eve of an unprecedented storm, when the country was in great distress. The flower of overseas Chinese affairs blossomed dimly, without brilliance. Later, the external threats, painfully experienced layer by layer, approached step by step. An unprecedented storm blew for eight years, and heavy rain poured for eight years, blowing the flower of overseas Chinese affairs to pieces. After eight years of hardship upon hardship, the leaders led their colleagues to tenaciously guard their posts, relying on a few bowls of thin gruel and a few thatched huts, enduring worries and dangers. When the enemy surrendered and victory came, everyone thought that after the rain the sky would clear and overseas Chinese affairs would bear some fruit. Who would have thought that storm after storm would follow, and the fruit of overseas Chinese affairs would never grow big? There were few people in charge and many critics, and everyone couldn't help but feel resentment and depression. However, how much help can emotions really give to facts? Everyone could only endure, endure the endurance needed in the revolutionary process, enduring and waiting for next year, the year after, and the year after that... In days like stagnant water, in circumstances like mold and rot, we passed day by day. This is how the 15-year history of overseas Chinese affairs was made. This is a history of hardship and also a history of steadfastness.</p>
<p>There is no country in the world with as many overseas Chinese as China, with as many as 12 million. There is also no country in the world where overseas Chinese suffer so much, to the point of being precarious. The large group of overseas Chinese scattered in 64 countries toil day and night, cultivating the land, doing manual labor, and working as tenant farmers, while others reap the harvest, become big merchants, become landlords, and fatten themselves to live in big houses, drive big cars, and enjoy themselves. Our overseas Chinese live in bad houses and eat bad food, and still have to be told that overseas Chinese are uncivilized. They scold when they want to scold, hit when they want to hit, slaughter when they want to harm, and massacre when they want to massacre. What a picture of quasi-colonial overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>After an epoch-making war, humans who have heard the sound of atomic bombs still harbor malicious thoughts. During the war, overseas Chinese suffered the enemy's cruelty, and the crystallization of their blood and sweat was completely destroyed. Wronged ghosts filled the wilderness, and the sea of blood was stained everywhere. After the war, still in shock, they suffered again as innocent bystanders, facing the threat of the death penalty. The rulers went all the way to the end, and the ruled went all the way to revolution. We overseas orphans, caught between two extremes, have become the unfortunate children of victory! The disasters of overseas Chinese are our pain, and they are also a major issue for overseas Chinese affairs today. Looking to the future, the prospects for overseas Chinese in colonial countries are bound to be bleak. Look at the bloodshed in Siam, the massacres in the Dutch East Indies, the burning and looting in Vietnam, and the anti-Chinese sentiment in the Philippines. Then listen to the voices of Malaysians opposing the granting of citizenship to foreign nationals. The arrogance of "exclusivity" has risen to the sky. In the past, the question for overseas Chinese was how to "manage themselves." In the future, the question for overseas Chinese will be how to "survive." Self-management is a matter of livelihood, and survival is a matter of existence. The self-management and survival of overseas Chinese are intertwined to form the problem of overseas Chinese affairs today.</p>
<p>The problem is getting more and more serious, but simply turning thoughts on the problem itself will not solve it, because the problem itself is not a problem, and the hundreds of millions of problems are caused by other problems as the main cause. The weakness of the country and the poverty of the people are really big problems. Therefore, relying solely on a weak overseas Chinese affairs agency that has no money, no power, and is ignored by others is, frankly speaking, of no help. But at present, the overseas Chinese affairs agency should do things other than the problem itself. This is the prerequisite problem of overseas Chinese affairs. Taking advantage of the 15th anniversary of the association, let's talk about some prerequisite events that the overseas Chinese affairs agency should do today.</p>
<p>1.  Awakening the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs: Awareness is attitude and behavior. What kind of awareness, there must be what kind of deeds. However, the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs among Chinese people seems to be too insufficient. In the future, schools should set up courses such as overseas Chinese affairs and the history and geography of Southeast Asia. The public opinion should greatly promote the importance of overseas Chinese affairs. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should use more pens and tongues to widely report on overseas Chinese affairs. It is necessary to let every household understand overseas Chinese affairs and feel from the bottom of their hearts that overseas Chinese affairs are indispensable. Only when the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs is consistently increased from top to bottom, and the seeds of overseas Chinese affairs are planted in your heart, his heart, and everyone's heart, can overseas Chinese affairs be rescued from the perfunctory situation.</p>
<p>2.  Administrative cooperation: The government is an organic whole, and the functions and powers of the administrative agencies of each department must be clearly divided. All administrative matters must cooperate with each other. Europe and the United States practice the "position classification system," setting up officials according to events and managing affairs according to officials. Each event determines its boundaries, and each official abides by his powers. Exceeding official duties is "usurping the altar on behalf of the chef," and dereliction of official duties is even more "holding a position without contributing." The departments related to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are the five ministries of internal affairs, foreign affairs, economy, education, and society. Except for overseas Chinese education, cultural undertakings, and social organizations that have been clearly defined, with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in charge of overseas affairs, there are still immigration, trade, relief, and condolences to be determined. I think it would be good to hold a meeting to discuss and decide. Once the decision is made, there is no need to compete for power, no need to shirk responsibility, no credit should be attributed to oneself, and no blame should be attributed to others. Overseas Chinese affairs are not a publicity business. Many things often cause misunderstandings among outsiders or irritate outsiders. Sometimes things are published first, and the person in charge feels resistance afterwards. This harms the country and harms the overseas Chinese. Everyone must recognize that all activities are for the sake of the country, and all benefits should be attributed to the country.</p>
<p>3.  Striving for the Centripetal Force of Overseas Chinese: It is the nature of overseas Chinese to love the country and love the government. They have an instinctive tendency, and they are especially protective of their motherland because they love and suffer from the oppression of foreigners. Their patriotism is even higher than that of the people in the country. Even if the motherland forgets them, they miss the motherland at all times, just like a one-sided love. When they see a small flag with a blue sky, white sun, and red earth, they entrust their pride and hope to that flag. Therefore, there is absolutely no question about the centripetal force of overseas Chinese towards their motherland. The problem is that the motherland itself has erected too many obstacles, forcing their centrifugal force to grow day by day. For example, the protection of overseas Chinese is weak. Often, after a tragedy occurs for a long time, the grass has grown on the graves of the dead, and then personnel are sent to express condolences or file protests. But how many overseas Chinese lives and property have been saved by condolences and protests? It seems that there is nothing else to do besides condolences and protests. Kowtowing diplomacy is really heartbreaking for overseas Chinese. The second problem is the restriction on the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in their places of residence. Mr. Liu Xinru said, "Countries such as the Netherlands, France, and England all restrict remittances from overseas Chinese, which cannot exceed ten pounds per month." Mr. Guo Xin, the representative of Malaya, said, "The local government restricts remittances from overseas Chinese, which cannot exceed forty-five yuan per month." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not negotiated to open these shackles that bind overseas Chinese. The third situation is the decline in the value of the national currency. The savings bonds and national salvation bonds purchased by overseas Chinese in the past, such as Australia, paid more than 150 pounds in Australian dollars to buy the national difference. If calculated by a thousand times, one pound in Australian dollars is equivalent to 10,000 yuan in national currency. In this situation, what is the loss for the overseas Chinese who have exhausted all their possessions to purchase bonds of various periods?</p>
<p>4.  Cultivating Overseas Chinese Talent: To build a country, we must first build people. To build people, we must first build officials. If we want to build overseas Chinese affairs, we must first build overseas Chinese administrative staff, so that each overseas Chinese administrative official can play a major role and a great efficiency in the process of building the country and building overseas Chinese affairs. The people who run overseas Chinese affairs are not necessarily overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, nor are they necessarily people from places where overseas Chinese originated. Sometimes these people are not as good as people from other provinces, because these people have opinions, cliques, regions, clans, and other traditional animosities. If we want the great unity of overseas Chinese, it is easier for a middleman to take charge and preside over the matter to achieve a unified effect. However, people who have not been abroad to handle overseas Chinese affairs must go abroad for internship after training, and must visit and investigate several places overseas, so as not to make what they have learned become empty talk and turn office work into building cars behind closed doors. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is really a university of overseas Chinese affairs. They are exposed to it and immersed in it on weekdays. If they are willing to learn seriously, they may not be able to become experts in overseas Chinese affairs. The most important thing is that the country should establish overseas Chinese affairs or overseas Chinese institutes in several universities, select young people who understand, have enthusiasm, and have ambitions for the country, and cultivate talents in overseas Chinese welfare, management, education, economics, trade, and supervision. When necessary, short-term overseas Chinese training classes can be held. The more developed the career, the more talent is needed. Whether you want talent or not depends on whether you want a career or not.</p>

<h3>The United States Plans to Draft a Four-Power Treaty, the Soviet Union Proposes Six Amendments, the Content of Which Overturns the U.S. Draft</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 15th] At the Foreign Ministers' meeting today, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall urged the appointment of a four-power plenary subcommittee to draft a 40-year treaty on the disarmament of Germany in accordance with the terms proposed last year by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The British and French representatives expressed their approval. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not directly express his approval or disapproval, but merely read out his previously prepared amendments, the content of which completely overturned the U.S. draft. The meeting was inconclusive and decided to postpone the discussion until tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 14th] Article 1 of the four-power treaty proposed by Marshall today stipulates that: (a) The German army, navy, and air force, as well as all military-related units, shall be disarmed and disbanded; (b) Germany is prohibited from manufacturing military equipment in the country or purchasing military equipment from foreign countries; (c) Germany is prohibited from retaining military-related equipment or engaging in manufacturing and research for military purposes. Article 2 stipulates that until the Allied Powers cease to occupy Germany, the Four-Power Control Commission shall implement a monitoring system, and Germany's acceptance of the above two articles is a major condition for the Allied Powers to cease to occupy Germany. Article 4 stipulates that the Four-Power Control Commission shall report its work to the United Nations Security Council at any time, and shall notify the Security Council immediately when it believes that Article 1 of the Four-Power Treaty has been violated or is about to be violated. If Article 1 of the Four-Power Treaty is violated, the Four Powers shall take necessary actions using military force.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow, 14th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today proposed six major amendments, all of which concern the Soviet Union's demands for a German peace treaty, and advocated that they be included in the U.S.-proposed Allied treaty in order to implement Germany's disarmament. The six amendments are listed as follows: (1) Include measures to eliminate German Nazism and implement demilitarization; (2) Stipulate four-power control of the Ruhr region; (3) Liquidate Germany's large enterprises and confiscate their property and return it to German state ownership; (4) Stipulate land reform measures; (5) Establish a democratic order in Germany; (6) The term of the four-power occupation of Germany should end only after Germany has fully fulfilled the payment of reparations, eliminated war potential, and established democratic politics, as recognized by the four countries. In this regard, Molotov's proposal is to demand that the treaty be redrafted, completely changing its foundation, and including the Soviet Union's demands, such as the four-power co-management of the Ruhr region, which the United Kingdom and the United States have resolutely opposed.</p>

<h3>U.S. Statement on German Peace Conference and Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 14th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall recently issued a statement to the press, saying that the United States proposes that the German peace conference should be in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and all countries that have declared war on Germany should participate in the peace conference. However, when voting in the conference, countries should be divided into two categories: those with the right to vote and those without the right to vote. The former category of countries can be divided into two types: (1) Germany's neighboring countries; (2) Those who have militarily participated in the war against Germany. In addition, the United States proposed that a clause be added to the new German constitution authorizing the German government to ratify the German peace treaty. When the German citizens vote to approve this constitution, the entire German people should be responsible for accepting this peace treaty. Under this condition, the German peace treaty should be signed and ratified by the German government, and the United States does not express its opinion.</p>
<h3>France and Czechoslovakia to Sign Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Prague, 15th] Czech President Benes is about to go to Paris to sign the French-Czech agreement.</p>
<h3>Many German Generals Planned to Overthrow Hitler</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] A new book by Allen Dulles, former director of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services in Switzerland, "The Underground Organization of Germany," is scheduled to be released today. It reveals that many German generals secretly plotted a coup in 1938, one year before the outbreak of World War II, to overthrow Hitler. However, when the coup was being secretly discussed in the office of the former German Army Chief of Staff Halder, former British Prime Minister Chamberlain suddenly came to Munich to seek peace, and the coup plan ended. This was caused by German democratic civil servants and generals, who believed that if a war broke out, Germany would be defeated, so they were determined to save it. However, Hitler's diplomatic victory in Munich led to the disappearance of the coup idea. Thereafter, secret plots continued, with coups and assassinations of Hitler combined, but all failed. Finally, a major exposure occurred in July 1944, and most of those in charge were executed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Supplies to Germany Total Approximately $500 Million</h3>

Other materials such as medicines and petroleum amounted to several million tons, worth approximately $65 million.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee Demands Indictment of Wallace, Wallace Has Expressed Disregard</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] Congress today demanded that criminal charges be filed against former Vice President Wallace and re-condemned Wallace's speeches abroad, but President Truman remained silent. The House Un-American Activities Committee intends to indict Wallace under the old Logan Act, which stipulates that any U.S. citizen who "conspires" with a foreign government to undermine U.S. policy may be sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fined $5,000. Committee Chairman Thomas, a Republican, said that the law applies to Wallace, the case is clear, and Attorney General Clark must indict him. Clark refused to comment. White House Press Secretary Ross declared that the President had nothing to say about the Wallace affair.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] After Wallace's speech criticized President Truman's foreign policy, the U.S. Congress criticized him. Wallace responded here today with contempt, saying, "If a state of war exists, then my expression of my own opinion can be accused of promoting the enemy. But for the rest of my life, wherever people are willing to listen to my speeches, I intend to continue to express my views on peace."</p>
<h3>Stettinius Hosts Reporters, Discusses His Meeting with Stalin</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 14th] Stettinius, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate in 1948, hosted reporters here today and revealed part of the content of his conversation with Marshal Stalin last Wednesday, all of which concerned censorship and newspapers. It is said that Stalin told him that some American journalists harbor malice towards the Soviet Union, "It will be difficult for our country to abolish censorship." Stalin said that the news published by some reporters described the Soviet government "like a zoo." Stalin also said that the Soviets do not find any major differences between the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties. Stettinius said that the rest of the conversation, which concerned economics, will be published in a general report on the European economy that will be submitted after his return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Agrees to Begin Negotiations on Wartime U.S. Lend-Lease Account, Totaling $11.4 Billion</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] The State Department announced today that after six notes from the United States urging the Soviet Union, it finally agreed to discuss with the U.S. side the liquidation of the $11.497833 billion military lend-lease account, and negotiations can begin as soon as Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov returns to office. From March 11, 1941, to September 30, 1946, the U.S. supplied the Soviet Union with a large number of tanks, aircraft, and civilian equipment. How much the Soviet Union needs to pay is expected to be determined in this negotiation. After breaking fourteen months of silence on this matter, the Soviet Union may reapply for a $1 billion loan from the United States. The United Kingdom and France are the two countries among the five major powers that have already agreed to liquidate their military lend-lease accounts and have also obtained huge loans from the United States. However, because the State Department and the Kremlin cannot agree on the terms of this loan negotiation, the Soviet Union's request for U.S. post-war financial assistance has remained deadlocked to this day.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative Speaks at International Trade Conference</h3>
<p>Advocates That All Countries Should Make Mutual Concessions</p>
<p>[United Press Geneva, 14th] John Kindleberger, Deputy Leader of the U.S. Delegation and Economic Expert at the State Department, delivered a speech today to representatives of 18 countries at the International Trade Conference, asking them to negotiate the reduction of tariffs with the greatest speed. The United States promises to support mutually beneficial tariff schemes. President Truman has declared that the Geneva negotiations cannot fail. However, unless other countries respond, no country is willing to take unilateral steps, because etiquette is reciprocal, and all concessions must be reciprocated by corresponding concessions from other parties. The United States has previously submitted a table listing the concessions it is willing to make in terms of tariffs. Now, in view of the concessions that the other seventeen countries intend to make, it is prepared to revise this table.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Agrees to Control Atomic Factories</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 15th] The Executive Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission met here yesterday. Soviet Representative Gromyko declared that the international community must establish an institution to implement measures to control atomic energy factories. The principle is self-evident, and the Soviet Union also abides by this principle to control its manufacturing and use. However, according to observers, Gromyko did not specifically state whether the Soviet Union would accept the control of atomic energy factories by international personnel from the United Nations.</p>
<h3>UN Special Session</h3>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Our Country's Announcement of Representative Candidates</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 15th] According to reliable sources, when the United Nations General Assembly holds a special session on the Palestine issue on the 28th of this month, the United States will send one representative, and the candidate may be Austin. It is heard that the United Kingdom will also only send its representative to the Security Council to participate. The special session was held at the request of the United Kingdom, and United Nations Secretary-General officials hope that other member states will also save money for the United Nations and send as few representatives as the United States, because the United Nations budget has difficulties. However, the Secretariat has not formally notified the governments of various countries. Observers are now awaiting the announcement of the candidates for China's attendance at the meeting, and are universally concerned about their attitude towards Palestine.</p>
<h3>Churchill to Visit France</h3>
<p>French Government to Award Military Medal</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill will come to Paris on or around May 10th, and will be awarded a military medal by the French government to commend his wartime achievements.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>Demands from Various Countries Exceed Total Value of Japanese Assets</p>
<p>[Asia East News Agency Tokyo, 15th] It is reported that the amount of reparations demanded from Japan by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, India, and New Zealand exceeds the total value of Japanese assets. The United States demands 130 to 150 billion U.S. dollars, and the amount proposed by China is even more than that of the United States. The figures demanded by other countries such as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are also considerable. However, MacArthur believes that the following two principles must be adhered to: (1) Allow Japan to retain industries that maintain the minimum standard of living for the people; (2) Distribute assets above this standard to various countries. In addition, the United States has priority to obtain Japan's liquid funds to be used for (1) the occupation expenses of the U.S. military stationed in Japan; (2) the payment for food supplies to Japan; (3) the payment for raw materials for reproduction to Japan.</p>
<h3>United Nations Headquarters Officially Accepted on the 13th</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service New York, 14th] The United Nations officially accepted the New York City headquarters on the 13th of this month. President Truman issued a special statement, saying that the United States is very pleased with the progress of the United Nations, and expressed sincere gratitude to the people of New York for their "great act" of donating the headquarters to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Attacks Again: U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 14th] Soviet Representative Gromyko today again attacked President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey at the Security Council session, demanding that aid to Greece be limited to economic aid only, opposing military aid to Greece and any aid to Turkey. Gromyko denounced the amendment proposed by Vandenberg, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as merely exacerbating the whole situation, and that such unilateral action was detrimental to the United Nations organization. According to Vandenberg's proposal, the U.S. could stop aid to Greece and Turkey if a majority of the eleven-nation Security Council or two-thirds of the fifty-five-nation General Assembly voted to do so, and the Security Council would not be allowed to use its veto power on this case. Gromyko denounced this move as a "preemptive arbitrary decision" on the United Nations' voting method, and that no country has the right to issue this. U.S. Representative Austin said upon leaving the meeting that he did not intend to reply to Gromyko again, and that he was now prepared to vote. The Security Council now faces three issues: (1) Austin proposed that the Security Council instruct representatives of the Balkan Investigation Committee to remain in the disputed area pending the Security Council's discussion of the investigation report. Gromyko believed this was unnecessary and therefore opposed it. (2) Gromyko proposed organizing a special committee to supervise all aid to Greece from any country. (3) Austin requested that the Security Council postpone discussion of Gromyko's proposal pending a decision by the U.S. Congress on what kind of aid to give to Greece and Turkey. The Security Council is scheduled to continue discussing the Greek issue on the afternoon of the 17th of this month.</p>

<h3>Student at Jiaotong University Killed by Car: District Attorney's Office Indicts Driver; Mayor Convened Mediation Yesterday; Texaco Company Agrees to Allocate 50 Million for Funeral; Family Awaits Court Decision on Compensation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] In the case of Mai Zigan, a student at Jiaotong University, being killed by a Texaco gasoline company truck, the defendant, Huai Jintantang, was detained by the Xinshijie Police Station and sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Prosecutor Lu Zhennan believed that the defendant confessed to the facts of the crime and said that the cause of the accident was "the brakes were not very good," and believed that the defendant, who was engaged in business, should have been aware and able to pay attention but did not, resulting in death, which constituted a crime under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Regarding this case, Mayor Wu convened a mediation yesterday morning with the manager of the Texaco Company and representatives of the students of Jiaotong University. At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, more than 500 students from Jiaotong University marched to the Municipal Government to appeal. Later, because Mayor Wu insisted that the student ranks disperse, leaving only a few representatives to participate in the negotiations, Jiaotong University then sent 20 representatives, along with Tax Director Wu, Director Wang, Lawyer Yan, and more than 20 family members of the deceased, to the Mayor's Office to negotiate with the Texaco representatives. Mayor Guo immediately suggested two solutions: (1) Resolve through legal channels, which can be directly filed with the District Attorney's Office. (2) Self-reconciliation between the two parties. Mayor Wu also expressed his willingness to assist. Texaco Company believed that civil compensation claims were acceptable, but criminal responsibility should be borne by the driver himself. Although there were several compromises, no satisfactory result was achieved, because the distance between the two sides was still far. Jiaotong University, based on the opinions of the victim's family, requested Texaco to compensate the family's pension from the age of 29 to the age of 60, with a monthly amount of one million yuan, plus the deceased's education expenses, totaling 585 million yuan. Texaco initially only admitted 20 million yuan. Wu Shi, the company's American legal advisor, said that the company has always handled such cases in this way, with precedents to cite, which aroused dissatisfaction among the students of Jiaotong University. After Mayor Wu's mediation yesterday, the company agreed to first allocate 50 million yuan for funeral expenses today. As for family compensation, they will await the court's decision. The negotiations came to an end at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Also: This newspaper received a letter from the Student Union of Jiaotong University yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: "Respectfully, after reading the news published in your newspaper on April 15 about a Jiaotong University student being run over, and the 'detention' of a lawyer yesterday, it was found to be inconsistent with the facts. The details are briefly described as follows: Jia Junzigan, a student in the Department of Mathematics of our school, was injured and killed by a truck of the Texaco Company on the 4th of this month. The school authorities negotiated with the company and instructed it to take care of the aftermath and compensate the deceased for the loss. However, the company returned the official letter twice, saying that foreigners do not understand Chinese, obviously shirking responsibility. On the 14th, Texaco sent one Chinese and one foreign staff member to the school. Principal Wu Baofeng and Director Wang of the Living Management Group of the Training Department met with them. However, the two members refused to negotiate, saying that the family must come to Shanghai before a solution can be discussed. The principal, the student union, and the fellow-villagers association are not enough to represent the family. Moreover, their attitude was arrogant and their words were rude. All of this shows their disregard for the dignity of our country and blasphemy of the sanctity of education. Our classmates were extremely angry, but because our school values reason, we only asked them to notify the person in charge of the company to come and temporarily let the two of them rest in the affairs group, with tea and cigarettes, and lunch was provided. However, they did not contact the company, but reported to the Municipal Government, the Police Bureau, and the Consulate by telephone, falsely accusing the students' actions of 'detention', 'extortion', and 'blackmail'. Afterwards, they shamelessly spread rumors to the outside world and various newspapers. Their arrogance is so great that it is hateful. If we do not refute it sternly, how can we correct public opinion and maintain national integrity. Your newspaper has always been known for its fair and just arguments, and its upholding of justice, but the sections published on the 15th are very different from the facts. Please investigate and correct them." (Note: The news on April 15 published by this newspaper, "Jiaotong University Student Run Over, Mayor Urges Reconciliation," was a Central News Agency draft, and there were no words such as "detention," "extortion," or "blackmail.")</p>
<h3>Solving Fisheries Difficulties: Exchanging Revival Opinions; Opening Ceremony of the Fishermen's Associations Conference of Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>The representative meeting of the Fishermen's Associations of various provinces and cities held its opening ceremony at Henshe, Jianguo West Road, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 30 representatives from eight units, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, and Shanghai, attended. Representatives from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Water Conservancy Corporation, and the Shanghai Fish Market were also present. Xu Pan'yun, the chairman, delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Strengthening Solidarity and Developing Production</p>
<p>He briefly said: "The purpose of this meeting is to gather colleagues from the Fishermen's Associations of various provinces and cities to jointly discuss in order to solve the current difficulties in the fishing industry, exchange opinions on the revival of the post-war fishing industry, and hope to take this meeting as a starting point to organize a national fishing industry organization, so as to strengthen solidarity, consolidate maritime rights, and develop production." Then, Fang Lian, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech: "He pointed out two points: (1) China's fishery production and technology are backward, and it is urgent to improve so as to catch up with advanced countries. (2) A national organization is conducive to the development of the fishing industry. I hope that all colleagues will actively work hard to ensure that it is realized as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Focusing on Fishery Loans and Fishery Salt</p>
<p>From 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the meeting continued. Representatives reported on the fishery situation and plans of their respective provinces and cities, with particular emphasis on the two major issues of fishery loans and fishery salt. The representatives believed that, based on the current actual situation, the so-called fishery loans are often like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, and even if there are occasional disbursements, the amount is extremely small, which does not help fishermen's production. The fishery salt distributed by the Salt Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent it from flowing into the black market, is mixed with red soil and yellow sand, which makes the salt products easily rot and discolor, causing huge losses to fishermen. Therefore, if we want to revive China's post-war fishing industry, these two major pains of fishermen must be fundamentally solved. According to reports, the meeting is scheduled to last for three days and close on the 17th. The proposals of various regions will be discussed tomorrow, and various fishing facilities in this city will be visited the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Qian Nengxia Remanded for Retrial; Request to Summon Zhao Binggu as Witness; Allegedly Participated in Underground Work</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Qian Nengxia, the former director of the Economic Bureau of the puppet Nanjing government, who was previously sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the High Court, was remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court. He was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Qian claimed that during his tenure as the director of the Social Welfare Bureau of the puppet Nanjing government, he established rural welfare centers, civilian experimental centers, and housing rental consolidation and mediation committees, all of which were beneficial to the people. He also claimed that when he was working in the puppet Ministry of Communications on September 9, he was introduced to Zhao Binggu by Ding Mocun. Zhao was engaged in subversive work and often traveled between Shanghai, Nanjing, and various parts of the mainland. In 1943, the Southeast Working Group of the Military Commission was established, and Ding introduced the defendant to Huang Qingzhong to participate in the work of the group. In the winter of 1943, the group set up a radio station at Ding Mocun's residence at No. 12 Chibi Road, communicating with He Guoguang, the director of the General Office of the Military Commission. The defendant was assigned to manage the radio station affairs. After the victory, Zhao Binggu appointed him as the deputy director of the Nanjing Office of the Southeast Working Group. If Zhao Binggu can be summoned to court to testify, it can prove that the previous confession was not false. After a long trial, because evidence still needs to be investigated, the hearing was adjourned to a later date, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The News Industry Makes Deng Sacred; It Should Not Be Destroyed or Insulted; Feelings of the Secretary-General of the Freedom Protection Association</h3>
<p>Recently, incidents of beating up newspaper offices have occurred one after another in various places. He Yuanming, the secretary-general of the People's Freedom Protection Association of this city, expressed his feelings: "The news industry bears a sacred mission, praising the good and punishing the evil, and its contribution to the foundation of society, improving customs and habits, is above all else. It has also played its greatest role in advocating revolution and publicizing the War of Resistance Against Japan. Its merits are no less than those of soldiers who defend the country with their spears. How should we respect and cherish it, and how can we destroy and insult it? Recently, incidents of vandalizing newspaper offices have occurred in various places, and they are the hands of knowledgeable young students, which is very regrettable. If the newspaper has inaccurate records, you can conduct negotiations and solutions in a reasonable way. Now, resorting to force is not only the misfortune of the news industry itself, but also a bad trend in society. In this upsurge of democracy and freedom, we should first respect the freedom of others, and we must not misunderstand democracy, so as not to make foreigners laugh." It is heard that the association has also sent letters to the People's Freedom Protection Associations in various places to provide just and strict assistance to the destroyed newspaper offices.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] One hundred bags of sugar recently transported from Taiwan to Shanghai are stored in the Xintai Chang Shipping Company at No. 1 Zhongzheng East Road.

<p>All Teachers Suspend Classes to Demand the School Rectify Discipline</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] All teachers at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road in this city suddenly suspended classes the day before yesterday and issued letters to students and parents. According to the spokesperson for the teachers, this action was a last resort, taken to urge the school to strictly enforce student discipline to maintain the future of education. Last Saturday, a few students, believing that the school's punishment of a certain student was "inappropriate," unreasonably demanded that the school retract its decision. They even forcibly entered classrooms, coerced teachers to stop teaching, and even maliciously insulted teachers, issuing leaflets attacking the faculty. In view of this, all the teachers of the school, considering that if this trend continues, the teaching profession would be disgraced and the school's discipline would be unimaginable, had no choice but to temporarily suspend classes and demand that the school strictly punish the students involved. Since yesterday, some orderly students have been attending temporary make-up classes with the teachers. Formal classes will resume as soon as the school fulfills all the teachers' demands.</p>

<p>Basketball Notes</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, the situation was most exciting last night. Hualian is indeed the most popular team, but their opponent, the US Navy Mingxing team, was weak and easily defeated, disappointing nearly a thousand spectators.</p>
<p>Da Li did not play, and Lao Bao also remained on the sidelines. Hualian fielded Xuesui, Adi, Xiangcheng, Guangyi, and Guorong. At the beginning, the five players used extremely beautiful and clear passing to break through to the basket and score. At this time, the Mingxing team had two or three shots, none of which were successful. Hualian took the lead with a score of 11 to 0.</p>
<p>Adi had to assist the two guards, Kong and Zhuo, in protecting their own basket, so Xuesui took on the responsibility of scoring. Once, he went straight to the bottom of the basket and successfully scored, and he spun to the ground behind the basket, winning applause from the entire stadium.</p>
<p>When the score was 17 to 5, Adi scored two consecutive reverse shots. Lao Kong, confident of victory, was at ease and scored two long-range shots. At halftime, Hualian was ahead 25 to 7.</p>
<p>In the previous game against Pei'er, it was already expected that Mingxing was only a mid-level team. If only shooting is considered, then they are not even comparable to mid-level teams.</p>
<p>In the second half, Zhang Liangxiong replaced Ren Xiangcheng. The score once became 31 to 7. The Mingxing team still fought tirelessly. This spirit is worth emulating. (Chang Nian)</p>

<p>Commander Xuan Delivers Speech Yesterday, Warning Shanghai Speculators; Economic Inspectors of the Garrison Headquarters Have Been Deployed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters and issued a stern warning to speculators who create rumors, manipulate monopolies, and raise prices. Xuan stated that speculators employ any means to achieve their goal of getting rich, seeking only profit. They must know that a few people getting rich means exploiting the right to survival of the majority of people. When the survival of the majority is seriously threatened, they will inevitably rise up in resistance. Then, the few speculators who "come for profit" will inevitably "leave with losses." Xuan also stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is most concerned about the price problem in this city and has instructed the municipal government and the garrison headquarters to jointly take responsibility, strengthen control, thoroughly investigate hoarders and speculators, and severely punish them. The garrison headquarters has now deployed economic inspectors to carry out work, and the results obtained will be transferred to the competent authorities for handling.</p>
<p>Analyzing the Reasons for Price Increases</p>
<p>Xuan analyzed the reasons for price increases. In addition to the artificial ills that should be eliminated, it is also necessary for the people of the whole country to be mindful of the difficulties of the current situation, reduce unnecessary consumption, practice frugality, and overcome difficulties together. Xuan expressed disagreement with the view that price increases are due to excessive demand and inflation. He believes that this is the view of capitalist countries, and it does not hold true in our country, which practices the Principle of People's Livelihood. He pointed out that the main problem with prices in our country lies in "waste" and "uneven distribution." If waste can be effectively curbed in terms of materials, and distribution is strictly implemented, then the seriousness of the price problem will disappear. As for inflation, the United Kingdom and the United States also had this phenomenon during the war, but the price problem was not serious after the British and American governments implemented material distribution systems.</p>
<p>Generate Power to Assist the Government</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the distribution system, Xuan said that the government has considered it, but he solemnly pointed out that the public should be aware, generate power, and assist the government, so that government orders can be effectively implemented. The root of all diseases in China today is that society does not yet have this power. Otherwise, all problems in China can be solved, he said.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Stable with a Weak Trend</p>
<p>Government bonds were initially stable yesterday but later weakened. There were rumors that the Assembly would intervene, making people more nervous. Although the physical bonds were advancing, the real estate offices 503 and 512 and retail investors were selling. The Class C bonds opened at 13,700 yuan in the morning, with a high of 14,200 yuan and a low of 12,400 yuan before settling down. As a result, compared with the previous close, Class A and B fell by 300 yuan, Class D fell by 200 yuan, and Class E fell by 400 yuan. Class C plummeted by 1,400 yuan, with a turnover of only 40,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Saw Mixed Ups and Downs</p>
<p>During yesterday's foreign stock trading, securities brokers, noting that the regulations requiring self-provided foreign exchange had been cancelled, predicted that the black market for gold and foreign currency would fall and decided to sell, resulting in weakness. However, land reclamation and coal mining stocks were favored and saw strong buying, resulting in profit. People from foreign companies continued to absorb Yi Sha and Mei Lian. Later, with the addition of buying from the Guangdong community, the market rebounded. Zhi Sha initially fell from 39,900 yuan to a low of 38,000 yuan, but ended with a high of 42,500 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel stocks fell slightly, land reclamation stocks rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, Yihe Brewery, and telephone stocks were flat, while the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>Rediscount Committee Held Third Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Bank's Rediscount Committee held its third meeting at 3 PM yesterday, presided over by Qin Runqing, in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank, lasting one and a half hours. The content included: (1) Of the 39 cases submitted by the Industrial Loan Review Committee, most are likely to be approved, with a total approved amount of approximately 1 billion yuan. (2) The Rediscount Committee decided to notify the Bankers Association to urge all banks and firms to submit cases regarding export material loans, as no cases have been submitted by the Export Material Loan Review Committee since its establishment. In addition, regarding whether the Industrial and Export Material Loan Review Committees are only limited to Shanghai or should be launched in major cities across the country, the Secretary-General of the Committee, Lin Chongyong, stated that this has not yet been considered. Currently, it is only being launched in this city. If the results are good in the future, it will be gradually extended to all parts of the country.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Market Steady, Price of New Longjing Tea Tends to Soften</p>
<p>The foreign tea market, which had been sluggish for a long time, saw buyers still trying to lower prices, but sellers, considering that prices had fallen to a considerable extent, gradually became unwilling to sell at lower prices. Therefore, only Meixing traded yesterday, but the market was able to barely hold steady, with prices hovering. As for various domestic teas, there was little change in supply and demand, and the market remained steady. The source of new Longjing tea from Wen and Hangzhou continued unabated, but the quality was deteriorating. Traders often softened prices, resulting in a clear fall and a hidden stability.</p>
<p>[Additional News] According to news from the production area, the new batch of Tunxi Maofeng tea, known for domestic sales, has been priced in the production area at around 15,000 to 16,000 yuan per catty. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. It is also learned that, due to the warm weather this year, the products from various production areas are better than in previous years, and the harvest is very optimistic.</p>
<p>[Additional News] This year's new Longjing tea from Wenzhou has been on the market for two weeks since it appeared at the beginning of the month. In terms of supply, tea shops such as Tongtaixiang and Fuyu have been shipping tea continuously, with approximately 400 dan arriving in Shanghai so far. It is also heard that the production area has little left to produce. Although it is currently the peak season for tea trees, the leaves are no longer suitable for making Longjing tea and are mostly used to make fried green tea and baked green tea. Therefore, the supply of new Longjing tea from Wenzhou is expected to decrease sharply in the future.</p>
<p>Affected by High Prices in Production Areas, Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Poor Absorption of Red-Tipped Rice Sold by Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Rice prices continued to rise yesterday, affected by high prices in production areas. The transaction price of white japonica rice reached 144,000 yuan, and other prices also rose. White yuan rice rose to as high as 170,000 yuan. The North and South markets received a total of more than 7,000 shi of goods, and the Social Affairs Bureau began selling red-tipped rice from northern Jiangsu in the market at a price of 120,500 yuan per shi, totaling 2,130 packages, but the market absorption was poor. Yesterday, the price of high-quality white japonica rice in Wuxi exceeded 150,000 yuan, and rice merchants found procurement and transportation difficult.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Rise</p>
<p>Fixed-price oil is still being rationed as usual, and the retail prices in oil shops remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Woolen Fabric Sales Strong, Prices Flat</p>
<p>Recently, the woolen fabric market has gradually improved. As the weather gradually warms up, actual sales have increased. Sales of men's and women's Chinese and Western clothing have been brisk, and merchants from all over the country have been replenishing their stock. The various groups on this street have made progress, resulting in lively wholesale and retail transactions in tea houses and large wholesalers and retail shops. Sales are mostly limited to light-colored, thin fabrics and summer goods. Prices remain flat, similar to previous days, without much fluctuation. There is a situation where prices cannot rise or fall.</p>

<p>Yarn Prices Soar, Especially in Tianjin and Shenyang; Merchants Mostly Purchase and Transport Northward; Rising Raw Cotton Affects Cotton Yarn Costs</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Although the yarn market has lacked formal market prices recently, the actual trading price of 20-count standard yarn has exceeded 5 million yuan per piece. Yesterday, the Northern merchants telegraphed that 20-count standard yarn could be sold for a net price of 5.3 million yuan per piece in Tianjin and 6 million yuan per piece in Shenyang (the above prices have deducted interest, wear and tear, and transportation costs). Therefore, even though the market price in this city is as high as 5 million yuan, a transfer can earn a net profit of 300,000 yuan per piece, so the merchants are happy to purchase and transport northward.</p>
<p>In addition, the cost of cotton clothing is currently increasing daily. For example, based on yesterday's price of 1.15 million yuan per load of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton, each piece of cotton yarn requires three and a half loads of cotton, which already costs more than 4 million yuan. Adding processing costs of over 1 million yuan per piece, the cost of 20-count yarn per piece has exceeded 5.3 million yuan. If the yarn factories sell at the freely traded negotiated price in March, they will suffer losses. It is heard that since last week, the price of 20-count yarn quoted by various yarn factories has been around 4.7 to 4.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>(Another Report) According to people in the industry, yesterday's raw cotton market saw prices soar again after hearing that the authorities had cancelled the policy of allowing imports with self-provided foreign exchange. Before the relevant authorities set the relevant policy, the market price of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton was approximately 1.1 million yuan per load. After the policy was agreed upon, various raw cotton importers planned to gradually raise foreign exchange themselves and place orders abroad. It was heard that the order price of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton was 700,000 yuan per load, and adding the two-month interest, the cost was 900,000 yuan per load. Therefore, the market price gradually fell below the 1 million yuan mark. It was heard yesterday that the policy of allowing imports with self-provided foreign exchange had been cancelled, and prices rose again to 1.15 million yuan per load.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Off-Exchange Bidding</p>
<p>Yarn prices initially opened stable yesterday, but with a slight preference from factories and merchants from other ports, speculation became active, and bidding continued to rise. The off-exchange bid price of 42-count phoenix yarn broke the 10 million yuan mark, reaching 10.2 million yuan, and 20-count special double horse yarn was bid at 5.6 million yuan, and double horse was bid at 5.15 million yuan, but there were few transactions. The market remains stagnant.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Sees Mixed Fortunes</p>
<p>Cotton cloth bids were mixed yesterday. As the authorities strictly controlled the market, it was difficult to buy new products. General speculators intended to sell at high prices, resulting in a weak market. Top-quality fine cloth was bid at 215,000 yuan, and Five Blessings was bid at 255,000 yuan, but it was heard that some were secretly selling at 190,000 yuan. There were no major changes in other colored cloths and linings. It was also learned that Morning Textiles Jiankai was selling various cloths yesterday, with the listed price for white plain cloth being 159,000 yuan for 20-count grade B, which was the same as the previous period, and the off-exchange bid price was 220,000 yuan.</p>
<p>General Meeting Discusses the Allocation of Union Cotton</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The General Assembly yesterday specially convened various parties to hold a meeting to discuss the allocation of Union Cotton. Those present were Li Chemin and Huang Chengdao of the General Assembly, Kong Habao of the Union, Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Office of the Textile Control Committee, and Li Gan, Chairman of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import-Export Control Committee. After discussion, it was decided that the allocation method of Union Cotton should first be based on the original allocation method set by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the data provided by the Textile Control Committee. Priority will be given to the 39 units of various yarn factories in Shanghai that have purchased half of the cotton yarn acquired by the Textile Control Committee, based on their inventory levels and the urgency of their cotton needs. Consideration will be given to allocating cotton to various yarn factories in other ports. It is heard that the current stock of Union Cotton in Shanghai is approximately 90,000 bales. Currently, over 20,000 bales have been allocated, and 60,000 bales are awaiting allocation. In addition, 40,000 bales are expected to be loaded in Shanghai soon. As for the various grades of cotton and their prices, they were also determined separately yesterday. Cotton with a length of 7/8 inch and Middling quality was priced at 650,000 yuan per load. The prices of other grades will be reduced or increased proportionally.</p>
<p>This Year's Silkworm Cocoon Production and Sales Plan May Be Discussed at the Next Executive Yuan Meeting; The Goal is to Show Concern for Silkworm Farmers and Increase Production</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek listened to the elders of the sericulture industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Chu Fucheng and Leng Yuqiu, about the 36th year's silkworm cocoon production and sales plan, he ordered the Executive Yuan to review the case after returning to Beijing. However, due to the backlog of cases, the case was not submitted for discussion and approval at yesterday's Executive Yuan regular meeting. However, it is expected that it will be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting.</p>
<p>Relevant parties emphasized that this year's cocoon production and sales plan was submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in March of this year. It is thought that the personnel changes in the Executive Yuan have caused a slight delay. However, as the matter has been ordered by the highest authority to be expedited, it is expected to be approved and implemented soon. However, the content of the plan is quite complicated. The technical problems of future implementation require much research. Moreover, in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the cocoon collection period will arrive in another month, and the time is very tight. Before that, it is necessary to make full preparations for various promotion work. Therefore, the authorities of the China Cocoon Corporation and representatives of the sericulture industry and silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are actively studying concrete opinions so that they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and coordinated implementation after the production and sales plan for this year is approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>It is learned that the total target of this year's silkworm production plan is 70,000 to 80,000 dan. Among them, the Guangdong area accounts for 14,500 dan, the Sichuan area accounts for 17,800 dan, and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas account for 35,000 to 40,000 dan. The government will purchase 30,000 dan of this total production at production cost for export to earn foreign exchange. The calculation of the cost of silkworm cocoon production this year is based on a ratio of one dan to four dan of rice (the ratio was 1 to 3 last year, and 1 to 5 before the war). The goal is to show concern for silkworm farmers and increase production. It is also learned that the national silk production volume before the war reached 278,000 dan per year. Therefore, the production volume in this year's plan is less than half of the pre-war volume. However, people in the silk industry observe that if prices are stable, domestic order is restored, and transportation is smooth, then the pre-war production volume can be restored within three years.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for Rising Silk Prices</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The price of silk in this city has recently followed the price of everything else, rising step by step. The reporter specially visited a relevant authority yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the rise in silk prices. They said that the general rise in prices and the proliferation of currency are certainly the main reasons. However, in terms of silk itself: (1) Silk production has decreased after the war. Before the war, the production volume in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including native silk, reached 100,000 dan per year. At present, the annual production volume is only 35,000 dan, approximately one-third of the pre-war production volume. (2) The silk stock in this city that can be circulated in the market is currently no more than 3,000 dan. Before the war, the stock was regularly maintained at 7,000 to 8,000 dan. At present, the stock is thin, and occasional price fluctuations often create a situation of supply falling short of demand. (3) There is a shortage of rayon in the market recently, and rayon has always been used by various silk weaving factories as a substitute for silk. The shortage of rayon has invisibly increased the demand for silk. All of these reasons are enough to promote the rise in silk prices.</p>
<p>Dr. Yao Le Develops Trade Between Tianjin and Xinjiang</p>
<p>[Report from our Tianjin Correspondent, 14th] Dr. Yao Le has recently started restoring trade between Tianjin and Xinjiang, using the principle of barter trade, exporting local and mineral products from Xinjiang and importing cotton textiles from Tianjin. The Tianjin-Xinjiang trade was interrupted by the closure of the Sui-Xin Automobile Company before the war and has lasted for more than ten years.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Airport: Reporters Gathered, Midnight Vigil, Waiting for Bombs: A Chronicle of the "Renault Bomb" Plane's Stopover in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special Report by Our Newspaper] Since the victory, Jiangwan Airport has become the air transport hub of this city. Dignitaries come and go, welcoming the new and bidding farewell to the old. News reporters can often witness magnificent scenes there. At two o'clock in the early morning yesterday, Jiangwan Airport once again became the target of reporters' interviews. The "VIP" being awaited was the "Renault Bomb" plane piloted by the atom-pen king, Renault. On the silver-white searchlight-illuminated runway, they witnessed a historically significant and interesting scene.</p>
<p>The great ambition of atom-pen king Renault is to break the round-the-world flight record set by Howard Hughes in 1938. At that time, Hughes' record was 91 hours and 14 minutes. Renault hoped to reduce the time for flying around the world to 65 hours.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Transport Command at Jiangwan Airport received news of Renault's arrival in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The control room constantly received phone calls from reporters from various newspapers, inquiring about the time of Renault's arrival. By 10 o'clock in the evening, more than 20 reporters were waiting at the airport for the landing of this supersonic aircraft.</p>
<p>However, there was still no news of Renault's special plane by midnight. According to a telegram from Calcutta, Renault took off from India at 6:03 PM Shanghai time. According to the estimate, he should have arrived in Shanghai by midnight. If there were no radio or other incidents along the way, the communication control room at Jiangwan Airport should have received reports of Renault's progress long ago. However, there was still no news after midnight. For a time, reporters and U.S. Air Force personnel at the scene suspected that Renault had encountered an accident while flying over the Hump.</p>
<p>At 1:45 AM, the receiver in the airport's communication control room suddenly received a very clear call sign. The loudspeaker repeatedly said: "Calling Shanghai Jiangwan Airport, calling Shanghai Jiangwan Airport!""Renault Bomb is preparing to land, Renault Bomb is preparing to land!" Thirteen minutes later, Renault's plane finally landed smoothly on the runway. After the special plane came to a stop, Renault happily disembarked, accompanied by his pilot, Odom, and his mechanic, Sally.</p>
<p>As soon as the plane landed, personnel from the U.S. Air Force rushed up to refuel, inspect the aircraft, and organize parts, while the reporters surrounded Renault to inquire about the flight. Zhang Peter, the chief of the municipal government's protocol section, stepped forward on behalf of the mayor to welcome him and presented him with a copy of the mayor's signed biography.</p>
<p>According to Renault, after taking off from Calcutta, he immediately increased his speed to 365 miles per hour. On the way, because he had to cross the Hump, the average flying altitude was above 19,000 feet. Regardless of whether Renault will be able to break the round-the-world flight record in the future, his flight time from Calcutta to Shanghai (eight hours) is already a new record.</p>
<p>Although Renault had not slept for more than 30 hours since taking off from New York, he did not appear tired. While his special plane was refueling, he went into the U.S. military cafeteria and ordered a ham and eggs meal to satisfy his hunger. His pilot and mechanic, however, collapsed under the wing of the special plane and slept for more than half an hour.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Renault took two specially made atom-pens and gave them to the mayor and Section Chief Zhang. He said that creating a new record of 65 hours was not a problem. Renault's mechanic, Sally, even sent a telegram to his fiancée, saying: "I will arrive in New York tonight on time. The wedding tomorrow will proceed as planned." Renault said with a smile: "I will make every effort to get back to New York tonight for my friend's wedding!"</p>
<p>At around 3 AM, the airport staff had prepared the special plane, and the fuel tanks had been filled with 1,200 gallons of gasoline, enough for a direct flight to Tokyo.</p>
<p>At 3:22 AM, Renault's special plane gradually moved towards the runway, and in an instant, it accelerated and took off from the ground towards Tokyo.</p>
<p>The reporters waited in the airport for five or six hours in the deep night dew. Only then did they breathe a sigh of relief. By the time they returned home, it was already dawn. Although they were extremely tired, they felt it was worth it to be able to see the real face of this fast plane that would create a new record in aviation history.</p>
<h3>Emergency Landing in Adak: Encountered Strong Headwinds En Route</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a United Press report last night, Renault's round-the-world flight special plane made an emergency landing in Adak in the Aleutian Islands at 6:25 PM yesterday (Shanghai time) due to a mechanical failure. The hope of creating a new record has suffered a serious setback. It is reported that after the Renault Bomb took off from Shanghai at 3:20 AM yesterday, it flew to Yokota Airport near Tokyo, Japan, at 6:58 AM on the same morning, stayed for 90 minutes, and continued to fly to Alaska. According to the estimated flight plan, it should have arrived at Anchorage in the Aleutian Islands at 8:23 PM on the same day. However, at an altitude of 19,000 feet over the North Pacific Ocean, it encountered strong headwinds, bad weather, and a lot of fog. Later, Seattle received news from Northwest Airlines in Anchorage that it had been forced to land.</p>
<p>[United Press Midnight Broadcast on the 15th] Renault's special plane left Adak at 9:27 PM (Shanghai summer time) and flew to Edmonton in Canada. Renault denied the claim that there was a mechanical failure on the plane. He said that he only made a temporary stop in Adak for safety reasons due to the bad weather. After arriving in Edmonton, he will fly directly to New York and still hopes to break Hughes' record.</p>
