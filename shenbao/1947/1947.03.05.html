<p>〔本報訊〕行總中共代表是否與其他中共人員同時撤退，昨尙未舉中樞指示，霍署長原定昨晚返滬，頃悉：將延至今晚。記者昨曾往訪伍雲甫氏，據表示，如依救濟無分畛域而論，中共駐行總代表仍希望繼續留滬，因行總亦有兩機構在中共區域以內，惟一切自待霍署長向政府請示後決定，如仍須撤退，已不及與今晨離滬之中共人員同行矣。</p>

<p>第一調查要項：（甲）中央銀行買賣黃金情形之調查　中央自去年三月初決定宣施買賣黃金政策以來，於三月八日由央行負責辦理，實際上負此項工作執行之責任者，為該行總裁貝祖詒，業務局局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁等三人，其拋售黃金方法，分明配與暗售兩類。明配方法，係田央行業務局以每日上午十時正之上海金價為標準，以決定當日央行牌價，根據金業銀樓兩公會會員之需要申請條數，由指定之同豐餘·太康潤·大豐恒三金號及方九霞昌記·楊慶和發記兩銀樓等五家負責購領，分發各申請會員。暗售方法；係由央行業務局於每日明配後，根據市塲情形，隨時以當時波動之黃金最高市價為標準，分批交由上述五家拋售，以期平定金市價格。一年以來，央行業務局執行配售工作，查有下列事實，堪為在意：（一）央行自執行黃金買賣工作以來，一切工作進行之方式與手續，并無正式明文規定，僅由該行貝·林·楊三人自行決定。（二）兩公會行號每日明配申請原有申請單之規定，不久即廢置不用，以致一切明配，暗售價格之決定及交易之成立，均僅憑央行與指定五家行號之對講電話而決定，此外，並無正式交易之契的與憑據。（三）央行所存黃金，原為四百兩一塊之金磚，而售出時以條（十兩）為單位，據林·陽兩局長云：以中央造幣廠溶金設備不全，乃交由同豐餘負責分配與大豐恒·宏豐永·生源永·久成永·楊慶和至記·裕發永·祥和等號，與同豐餘訂立合同，以九九純金成色分化金條，分發各金號·銀樓央行給與同豐餘以每十兩三分之火耗（見林鳳苞談話筆錄及詹蓮生訊問筆錄）。（四）央行指定之五家行號，除同豐餘一家為詹蓮生所開辦者外，其餘四家據供均係由詹蓮生介紹者（見詹蓮生方九霞·太康潤·楊慶和等訊問筆錄）。（五）所有五家指定行號向央行領領取金條，均須經詹蓮生之簽名蓋章，方能發給（見同上筆錄）。（六）在央行將指定行號負責配售工作之前，申請擔任配售工作者，共六十五家，結果指定者為五家，此五家中同豐餘尙未領有上海市財政局之營業執照，五家之資本據其登記計同豐餘為一千五百萬元，太康潤為二百四十萬元，大豐恒偽一千萬元，方九霞昌記為九百一十萬元，楊慶和發記為九百六十萬元，而申請未獲指定之金號·銀樓，其登記資本多有遠為鉅大者（見附件七）。（七）央行自去年執行買賣黃金工作以來，逐日均有詳紐英文報吿一份，向宋院長報吿，本年於財政部始通知央行報吿售金情形，央行自一月份起，始每星期有一黃金買賣統計表之呈送。（八）據央行報吿，除去年三月至十一月之黃金買賣數字以事關機密，未便全部追問列報外，計十二月份買入黃金二零五六條，售出七八三零六條，一月份買入黃金三零零條，售出黃金六八四五四條，二月份至十五日停售止，買入黃金一三五條，售出黃金一零九八六條，其收入者僅為礦金，故市售實際上僅有賣出，并無買入。（九）自本年一月四日起至停售日止，央行委託五家配售黃金七九三八二條，以同豐餘最多，計四三五九七條，其次太康潤，一六二四七條，大豐恒七三五九條，方九霞昌記四五零二條，楊慶和發記七八三七條，同豐餘約佔全部售額百分之五十五。（十）據央行列報一月四日至二月十五日之配售黃金條數，與同豐餘等五家賬簿所列配售黃全條數，逐日各有不同，總數亦有出入（見附件八九）。（十一）央行於二月十日突然停止配售黃金，以致黃金市價在漲，據該行林局長，楊副局長談：其停配係奉該行總裁貝祖詒之指示，委員等以此事為金潮促成之重大原因，經於二月廿日電呈將主席在案。〔下轉第二版〕</p>
<h3>蔣兼院長親主持例會　經委會改隷政院　修正組織條例送立院完成立法程序　管制物價劃入該會職掌</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕行政院四日上午十時舉行第七七八次例會，蔣兼院長主席，王外長世杰報吿外交，秦德純報吿國防，決議通過修改最高經濟委員會組織條例：（一）名稱改為全國經濟委員會，（二）原隷國府，現改隸行政院，（三）該會職掌，加「特定經濟措施之推動」一項，如輸入管理，輸出推廣，公共工程，物價管制等工作之推動，均在該會職掌之內。（四）當然委員增加水利委員會委員長，中央銀行總裁，另有委員十人至廿人等案。主席於十時正蒞院，議案討論完畢，即席訓勉各部會首長，今後應加强行政效率，切實執行經濟緊急措施方案，會議於十一時半結束，嗣即赴院長辦公室批閱公文，十二時廿分始離院。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕最高經濟委員會，自遵國府令成立迄今，其組織條例迄未在立院完成立法程序，因立院認為最高經委會旣隸屬國民政府，而所管轄各事，復與政院類別相等，故遲遲未提付討論。頃該會組織條例，於四日政院例會中修正通過，改隸政院，更名為全國經濟委員會。其組織條例與前最高經委會組織條例無大出入，僅略作修正，即日送立院完成立法程序。又例會中同時通過物價管制委員會，隸屬於全國經委會。政院院長兼委長，副院長兼副委長，經·財·糧·農·社等各部會首長，央行總裁，京·滬市長為委員。每週舉行例會一次，決定原則，執行則分由各有關機關負責。</p>
<p>頌務員配售物品主席諭切實辦理</p>
<p>〔中央社社南京四日電〕蔣主席對公敎人員配售日用必需品，極為重視，於四日上午政院例會時，面諭各負責人員，應切實迅速辦理，俾各公敎人員得獲實惠。</p>

<h3>立委簡貫三等建議　處置國外存款辦法　收買四成征用四成並課徵所得稅　立院交財政兩委會審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院四日晨九時三一六次例會中，新增立委芮逸夫，劉家駒，連天祥，傅　，郭處裳，王俊，傅網良，白兆鳳等八人首次出席，孫院長主席。開會討論前，對新增委員曾作簡單介紹。旋討論例案，傅斯年，　本　代表中研院出席，對修正中研院組織法，暨中研院评議會條例草案加以說明。旋經討論後通過。並通過內政部人口局組織法，水利委會水利示範工程組織法等。又簡貫三，劉不同等提出臨時動議，建議國防最高委會，對於國人在國外之現有存款，以十年或廿廿公債方式收買四成，以捐獻方式征用四成，並對於已經支取之國外存款，按其原存數額，以　進方式課徵綜合所得稅。其理由為：抗戰時本應援照英國之例，征用國人在國外之存款，最近因經濟情勢緊迫，外匯用途激增，始於二月十六日由國防最高委會通過收貿國外存款之決議，但美國政府業已解凍存款，各存戶早已自行支取動用，或化　國人民之姓名，以期逃避，故政府現雖有收買之決議，但其結果未必大有所獲，以適應財政經濟之需要，為補救此種缺陷，似應以公債方式收買四成，蓋現在法定匯率每美元為一萬二千元，若按此項匯率以法幣收買國外存款，勢必加速通貨膨脹之惡化，並擴大游資之流竄，利小害大，實非妥策，似應以十年二十年之長期公債收買四成，以延綏國庫之負擔，同時以捐獻方式征用四成，蓋三十三年政府舉辦黃金存款，其後强獻四成，國外存款旣無法令根據，又係逃避資金，若不令其捐獻四成，未免令人有不平之感。現美金外匯於一年之內竟有五倍厚利，倘不着令捐獻，何能取信於民。至對於已經支取之國外存款，按其原存數額，以累進方式課征綜合所得稅，因解凍存款旣捐獻征用，而對於已將存款支取之存戶反置之不理，未免厚於此而薄於彼，故亦應使其仍對國家負納稅之義務。關於實施辦法，彼等主張由政院擬具後送立院審議，以符立法程序，將來向國外辦理交涉，始有根據。經決議：該案交財經兩委會審查。</p>

<h3>上海金潮調查報告　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>金號銀樓售金情形</p>
<p>（乙）金號銀樓售金情形之調查　上海市面作黃金交易者，分為兩類：　為金號，係轉作黃金交易者，　為銀樓，作飾金買賣者。銀樓係以主顧銷售量為標準，交易者以黃金飾器為限，故其吞吐量較小，且銀樓多有悠久歷史，重視信用，其營業較為穩健，不易作冒險之投機事業，故一年來銀樓業方面向央行配售之金條較少，金號則專以黃金投機買賣為主，大戶購買者，大都集中於金號，故金市之波動及金價起伏之決定，均係操之金業方面。以是，一年來央行拋出黃金，由金業公會方面購買者，遠較銀樓方面為多，除正式金號外，更有專為代客買賣之商號，大都旣無正式店面，亦未經登記立案，而其買賣活動力甚大，投機者趨之若驚，無形中為一變相之金交易所，此對黃金市場頗多不良影響，而地方當局未能事先取締。即上述申請承辦配售工作之六十五家行號，其中未經登記領取營業執照者達四十四家，指定之五家行號亦有未曾領有營業執照者，其平日管制未嚴，致投機者得以擾亂金融市場，恣行無忌，實為疏忽之處。</p>
<p>詹蓮生具控制力量</p>
<p>至上述五家行號承辦央行黃金配售情形，經委員等一一訊問，其負責人員幷調查各方情節，下列事實足資注意：　名義上雖有五家承辦央行配售黃金，實際上不惟太康潤，大豐恒，方九霞，楊慶和四家均係由同豐餘主持人詹蓮生介紹，且央行一切金條之鎔化與金條之配發，均係由同豐餘與詹蓮生經手，是以同豐餘與詹蓮生不惟對央行自去年三月八日以來出售黃金之總數量均全部洞悉，且對其他四家顯然有完全控制為一體之力量，以一本作金業投機之金號與商人，對央行可以洞悉其售金底數，對同行可以一手控制，於適當時機造成一黃金風潮，以乘機漁利，自屬顯然</p>
<p>央行同人涉有嫌疑</p>
<p>央行每日配售黃金價格係以五家對講電話報告爲準，作為決定，而五家旣均在詹蓮生控制之下，則金價之決定，自容易受其指使操縱。　央行每日配售黃金，除明配係兩公會會員之申請外，暗配由五家承購後，其分配情形如何，售價如何，央行均以為自由買賣，不再過問不免予人以操縱之機會。　五家承辦配售黃金之行號，同時更有向市上購進黃金情事，尤以同豐餘在政府將公佈停售黃金前，更突為大量購進，不惟不合情理，且有聞風操縱之嫌疑。　查閱五家配售帳目，其配售戶行，列有中央銀行同人多筆，即管理黃金庫賬之　理王松灣，亦列有金條購買賬目，執行黃金配售業務之央行，而其人員有此交易行為，殊有利用職權與商人勾結以求漁利之嫌疑。（未完待續）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>清寒學生的貸金問題</h3>
<p>本市各界人士所發起組織的清寒學生貸金委員會，已於日昨正式成立，並公推潘議長公展氏為主任委員，主持一切。據潘議長表示，該會擬籌募貸金十億，除市政府核准撥給五億而外，其餘五億，則須向各界勸募；又因各級學校業已開學上課，清寒學生迫切需要貸金，乃在勸募貸金工作未完成之前，先向各銀行商借五億，這一學期清寒學生的貸金問題，在大體上可以說是已經解決了。惟在技術上，尙有幾個技術的問題，有待商榷的必要。</p>
<p>第一是貸金的分配問題。因為貸金的總額限於十億，乃使獲得貸金的人數與其所獲得貸金的數目成了反比例；貸金生的名額規定得太多了，則其所獲得的貸金，就要減少，而在目前上海的環境之下，各級學校的取費都定得相當的高，杯水車薪，無濟於事，清寒學生卽使獲得貸金，但是他的經濟問題，仍沒有解決；反之，若把貸金的數目提高了，則貸金生的名額，勢必減少；但是在今日的上海，清寒學生比比皆是，如何使清寒學生，都能獲得貸金，仍是一個嚴重的問題。所以貸金如何分配？的確值得該會縝密研究的。我們調查上海大中小各級學校的收費情形，姑且作一假定的分配，以供貸金委員會的參考：小學貸金生名額定為三千名，每人貸金十萬，中學貸金生名額定為二千名，每人貸金二十萬；大學及專科貸金生名額定為一千名，每人貸金三十萬。</p>
<p>第二是關於貸金生的審核。有資格獲得此項貸金的學生，必須同時具備下列兩項必要條件：一是家境確係清寒，二是學行眞正優異；二者不可缺其一，如果家境清寒而品學並不優異的，仍無獲得貸金的資格；因為貸金是從社會募集而得，而社會只願意協助無力讀書的優秀學生。反之，如果是學行俱優而家境不清韓的，根本就沒有要求貸金的必要。若讓其冒領，則必奪取了其他清寒學生應得的一份，與社會集資救濟清寒學生的目的，不啻背道而馳。所以凡欲申請貸金的學生，必先考慮自己本身，有沒有具備這兩項必要的條件。同時據潘議長談稱，申請及發給貸金的手續，將由貸金委員會與各學校當局合作辦理，所以對於審查工作，我們認為各學校當局應該多負些責任。</p>
<p>第三是貸金向社會各界勸募的問題。『為善最樂』，是人人都知道的，尤其對於救助清寒學生，只要自己經濟能力所及，無不願意慷慨解囊的，所以要向社會勸募貸金五億，本來不是一件困難的工作。不過上海的市面，最近又經過這一次金鈔狂漲的風潮，多少終要受些影響，有的或許也有自願不暇的困難，但是敎育事業是國家的基本工作，尤其是那些清寒學生，大半是學生中的優秀份子，將來個個是國家的棟樑，人人是社會的中堅，怎能坐視這些優秀學生因經濟困難而致失學呢！所以我們站在提倡敎育促進文化的立場，為下一代着想，不得不向上海各界人士呼籲，請求各界人士，有力出力，有錢出錢，務使貸金委員會所欲募集的數額，能於最短期內募集。所謂天助自助，協助清寒學生繼續求學，比較任何救濟事業，更有意義，更有價值，不但直接救濟了大批清寒學生，而且間接無異為國家社會栽培了許多有用的人才。一舉兩得，何樂而不為呢？</p>
<p>第四，現在各級學校均已開學多日，如何繳費？早已使一般清寒學生坐臥不安；而申請貸金的手續，還有沒有辦理的；再加以審查，又不是一件簡單的工作，故一般人士對於敎育貸金，不免發生「春行冬令」之感。這固然是事實，但是我們應該積極展開貸金工作，尤其希望各級學校當局切實予以協助，務須於最短期內，完成初步審查的工作，俾使一般清寒學生能夠早日領導貸金，不再為欠費而苦惱。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於品學俱優的清寒學生，也得說幾句話。君等因家境清寒無力入學而接受社會的貸金，並不是一件可恥的事情，在目前環境之下，國民經濟的困難，已臻於極度，家長無力負担子女的學費，已成為普遍的現象。在過去，我們也常常聽到少數學生，受了上海社會虛榮心的煊染，竟以清寒為可恥，硬着頭皮，不願向校方聲請，這種錯覺應該糾正。所以我們盼望本市各級學校的清寒學生，踴躍聲請貸金，庶使清寒貸金委員會設立的宗旨，得以完全實現。至於獲得貸金的學生，自應認識目下經濟情形的困難，體念社會救濟的美德，珍惜求學時期光陰的寶貴，加倍努力，刻苦自勵，把自己養成對於國家社會眞正有用的人才。唯有這樣，才不會辜負社會對於下一代的期望。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社鄧扣克西日電〕法外長皮杜爾於午後一時抵此，英外相貝文於二時亦接踵而至，羣衆夾道歡呼，慶祝此一簽約大典。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社四日電〕英法盟約發字儀式，將在鄧扣克市政府大會堂舉行，地位不甚寬敞，僅可容納一百五十人，法國代表團，除皮杜爾外長而外，尙有外交部秘書長旭凡爾，外交部政務司司長繆維爾外部經濟司司長亞爾芳。英代表團，除員文外相等一行而外，尙有英駐法大使特夫古柏，英駐法大使館武官瓊斯將軍，英駐法大使館審贊克拉克。皮杜爾外長及法駐英大使馬西格里將代表法政府簽署盟約。貝文外相及英駐法大使特夫古柏，將代表英政府簽署同盟條約。又據此間本日接獲消息，貝文外相等一行，原定搭乘驅逐艦「比塞斯德」號前來加萊，現已決定改乘渡輪「股維克塔」號，其原因係由於戰艦內設備不甚相宜。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三日電〕「泰晤士報」頃載稱：英法盟約實無任何規定，足以引起西歐集團之觀念。不寧唯是，抑且英法盟約所規定之條款，日後或可擴大成為四强公約。關於經濟合作之條款，僅為對於兩國間業已存在之事態，予以證實而已。此在「的克郵報」則載稱：一俟盟約簽字之後，其副本立即電知倫敦，提交下議院討論。至於盟約全文須至議會批准後，始能發表云。</p>
<h3>英美兩國外長啓程赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔中英社華盛頓四日專電〕美國出席莫斯科外長會議之代表國，將由國務卿馬歇爾率領，於五日晨九時乘專機四架離此，馬氏之助手及美國新聞記者卅六人隨行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕英外相貝文在鄧扣克簽署英法盟約後，即往比利時邊境乘專軍赴莫斯科。皮杜爾則將返巴黎一行，定星期三晨飛莫斯科。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕貝文外相於啓程赴莫斯科前夕，接見記者發表談話稱：本人感覺吾人目前已抵達人民業已認識必須解決世界問題，並確立今後人類進步途徑之階段。貝文自謂身體甚佳，對此次莫斯科會議屬望殊殷，渠曰，余此去抱有希望，雖然在會議中發展如何，尙難逆料，但余對於會議結果，仍如往昔之懷樂觀云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕可靠方面息：貝文外相與馬歇爾國務卿可能在莫斯科談及希臘問題。英方建議若美國對希蠟從務經濟援助，則英軍必須繼續駐希之點，正由貝文及英外部要員在考慮中。英政府發言人指出上次英政府關於希蠟之聲明，已表示駐希英軍當予大量减少。倫敦政界人士認為美政府所提出請英政府考慮是否可以取消於三個月內撤退駐希英軍之決議一點，確為英國政府甚難處置乏問題。</p>
<p>八項問題覓取解決</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教三日電〕關於中國問題，此間消息靈通人士談稱，美國務卿馬歇爾將在四外長會議提出此項問題加以討論。綠在中蘇友好盟約簽字之際，蘇聯曾同意不阻礙蔣主席為設立全國一致之聯合政府所作之努力，而今美國已宣佈退出中國，故英國方面希望蘇聯更能遵守其諾言。據接近英政府人士談稱，貝文外相此次前往莫斯科，至少須解決與世界和平有重大關係之八項問題，中國問題亦包括在內，澦料莫斯科外長會議將歷二月之久。貝文外相所擬解決之八項問題，為：（一）德國問題及起章對德和的；（二）奧國問題，對奧和約可能在莫斯科簽序；（三）英美蘇法締結四强公約，俾確保德國永久解除軍備；（四）修改英蘇盟約問題，貝文外相並可能與史達林舉行晤談，對於修正一九四二年英蘇同盟條約有所商討。貝文外相將隨身携帶草案一份，一俟抵達莫斯科之後，即交與史達林；（五）韃靼尼爾海峽問題，蘇政府曾表示希望修正蒙特婁公約，貝文外相亦曾通知土耳其政府，謂蒙特婁公約必須由該約余證簽字國舉行國際會議，始能加以修正，藉此以緩和土國之恐懼心理；（六）希臘問題，此一問題將由貝文外相與馬歇爾國務卿加以討論；（七）巴勒斯坦問題；（八）中國問題。</p>
<h3>美衆議院辯論　希臘問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕美衆議院今日開始辯論英國迫切要求美國協助處理希臘問題一事，同時馬歇爾國務鄉亦參加衆院撥款小組委員會議，討論國外一般局勢，尤其是希臘問題。共和黨衆議員吿衆院稱：國務院之外交政策，堅定而現實，足以防止希臘被受命莫取科之共黨所把持，并可阻止蘇聯成為地中海强國，余對此表示欣慰。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕衆院撥款委會今日開會時，國務卿馬歇爾曾向之重提英國呼籲援助希臘之要求，此事恐將引起戰後外交政策上最激烈爭辯，馬卿所提之詳細內容不得而知，惟悉馬卿曾敦促該委會通過美國借款，俾可防止希臘成立共產政權云。</p>
<p>〔中央社雅典三日合衆電〕頃據確息二希臘政府已訓令駐華府及倫敦之大使，對英美兩國關於希臘前途問題之協議，表示同意。</p>
<p>希北遊擊隊</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典三日電〕希臘官方稱：希臘軍事當局握有證據，可證自聯合國調查團於一月前抵希後，希北之遊擊隊仍自空中獲得武器之接濟，乃係由希臘北鄰供給者。</p>
<p>赫爾利談片</p>
<p>〔聯合社新墨西哥州　爾布柯克三日電〕美國前駐華大使赫爾利少將今日向記者談稱：「美國退出中國與踏進希臘，此二事中必有一誤。渠所以辭去駐華大使職務之故，蓋因美國正　入殖民帝國主義方面之强權政　，與蘇聯之帝國主義適得其反。美國決定援助希臘，可為此說之佐證」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社四日漢城電〕據可靠方面稱：以李承晚為首·金九為副之朝鮮「臨時政府」，可在四十八小時之內公佈成立。</p>
<p>戰時流亡重慶之朝鮮臨時政府主席已與李承晚及民主黨成立諒解，組織此朝鮮獨立政府·金九與民主黨在內閣中之席次排定後即可發表公報云。</p>
<p>美蘇應恪守諾言使朝鮮完成統一</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：美共和黨義員夏佛在衆院發表演親，略謂蘇聯現以處置波蘭之方式對付朝鮮，使之成為共黨之另一傀儡國。英聯在其佔領區內建立傀儡共產政權，揚言允許韓人實行自治，同時用種種方法使該區韓人變成共產黨員。查一九四五年十二月美蘇兩國曾在莫斯科成立協議，使朝鮮重行團結，而成立全國統一之臨時政府，但此項決議終以蘇聯之阻撓而迄未實施。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕朝鮮政務協會會長金楊榮頃發表廣播演說，建議美蘇二國在莫斯科會議時，應正式或非正式討論朝鮮問題。其所建議之要點如次：（一）朝鮮卅八度之「不自然」分界綫，應設法加以取消。（二）由朝鮮人建立臨時政府，不受美蘇二國之干涉。（三）美蘇軍隊同時退出朝鮮。（四）臨時政府可選任外籍顧問及技術人員，協助建設國民經濟。（五）美蘇二國應保障朝鮮之主權，不得在朝鮮覓取政治與經濟特權。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科三日電〕莫斯科廣播電台頃發出消息稱：史逐林元帥，因其他職務繁重，業已辭去國防部長之兼職，將由軍政部次長布爾加寗將軍繼任。按布爾加寗將軍生於一八九五年，曾任電力機器製造廠經理，大戰期間曾任紅軍總司令茹哥夫元帥之政治專員，一九四四年被任為外委會主席，不久即晋陛為上將，並繼國防部次長伏羅希洛夫元帥之任，旋即調任軍政部次長以迄於今。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕此間蘇聯非官方人士咸信史達林以六十七歲高齡，辭去軍職之舉，並無非常意義。辭職原因以職務繁劇示勝担荷，當係事實。綠蘇聯月前方以從事增加工業生產，加速推行本屆五年計劃，渠之辭去兼職，當與此有關。史氏現仍留任最高蘇維埃主席團主席，共黨中央委員會秘規長及監察院主席等職。布爾加寗曾任人民委會副主席，實即蘇聯副總理，戰時調任軍中要職，向被公認為外交墍行政幹才，初不僅一偉大軍人。當其戰時担任莫斯科市蘇維埃主席，頗能發揮所長。</p>

<h3>韓北徵兵說蘇聲明不確</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕莫斯科電台今日宜布：朝鮮南部美軍司令霍奇所謂蘇聯正在鮮北微兵五十萬各之說，毫無根據，純屬虛妄之談。按霍奇曾引證蘇聯電台本身之報吿，謂十七歲至廿五歲之朝鮮人正在徵發云云，根據鮮北人口一千萬至一千一百萬人估計，因而揣測為五十萬人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕衆議院今日辯論外交及預算案，共和黨議員　克孫宣稱：倘謂吾國六千萬個生產者，能担負復興全世界之重任，此乃數學上之錯　。吾人雖可供給相當食物與藥品，緩和飢饉與痛苦，但經濟上的邪說誤認吾人可以復興世界。共和黨議員梅樂提及希臘時，認為該國乃巴爾幹半島方面碩果僅存之民主希望。但共和黨議員霍夫曼警吿美國應多多留心國內之事，然後美國青年可派軍國外，以解決希臘，巴爾幹與即國方面之糾紛。共和黨議員布弗特稱：未來對希臘貸款引起美國是否在經濟方面織續受史達林玩弄之問題。數年以來，美國以數萬英國幣傾入中國，法國，及南斯拉夫，但何人能謂各該國較兩年以前距離共產主義更遠乎？</p>

<h3>靑年會徵募大會　名流參加開幕禮　吳市長妙喻「太極圖」　潘議長闡述「役於人」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市靑年會第四十七屆徵募大會，昨午十二時假茂名南路上海體育會，即前法國總會，舉行開幕典禮，由吳市長任該會徵募總隊長，各界名流參加者達五百餘人。大會由顧惠慶博士主席，由吳市長，潘議長，孔祥熙，　任之，及該會總幹事陳幹臣等分別致詞，並有許愛娟之獨唱及曾惠錫之鋼琴等餘興節目，情緒熱烈，迄下午三時始散。</p>
<p>吳市長昨日以道家之太極圖，譬喻今日之社會。渠稱：太極圖中有黑白兩種顏色，乃黑暗與光明之象徵，亦即表示社會存在着善惡兩種勢力。若惡勢力得勝，則天下必大亂，故凡是人都應有與惡勢力搏鬥之決心。在這種時代中，要騙散黑暗，必須把人心變好，並要支持社會上之善勢力，靑年會是現社會中之一支善流，所以吾人必須盡力支持它，使之欣欣向榮，促社會走向真善美之路。</p>
<p>潘議長稱：凡事團結便是力量，任何事情，只要許多人共同努力，則必可達到目的。反之，若只靠少數人之力量，則小事亦難以成功。今天靑年會開始徵募，有如許人參加，其結果可以預卜。靑年會之目的為「非以役人，乃役於人」。我國自抗戰之後，社會道德極形低落，挽救之道，唯有以「役於人」之精神造福人羣。國民黨之十二條守則中，即有一條稱「助人為快樂之本」，天下真正之快樂在於與人同樂。靑年會向以服務為宗旨，吾等必須愛護之，深望本次徵募能迅速成功，俾靑年會之事功得以推進。</p>

<h3>靑浦十五條命案審結　自髮垂髫到庭作證跪求伸雪　兩被吿竟稱被殺者均為強盜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偽靑浦縣西安鄉鄉長鄒寶賢等慘殺蘇北鄉民十五人一案，昨晨在高院審理終結，定十一日上午宣判。</p>
<p>該案發生於三十四年二月二十八日，吿訴人顧年林等各駕小船，停泊於西安鄉小寅鄉附近老宅河浜地方，因係廢曆年初，無工可做，乃由顧之長女黃顧氏，長婿黃開山，次婿周正鴻，及崔小狗子，嵇克俊，嵇鄧氏，劉四十子，劉小五子，孟二，顧長關，季步陛，周六夫妻，劉金之，劉小二子等十六人，結伴上岸拔草，以作燃料。</p>
<p>當時崔小狗子拔去小寅鄉鄉人之竹笆，與楊阿大，陳阿木等發生口角，繼將小狗子等毆打，周六不服，與之理論，楊阿大陳阿木等即棄崔小狗子而毆周六當場受傷身死，楊阿大等知己肇禍，一面報吿鄉長鄒寶賢，一面由保長薛順德鳴鑼聚眾，三四十人團集，手持扁擔釘耙，將被害人圍住兇毆，除周六已斃命，劉小二子乘隙逃脫外，其餘十四人即被捆縛，迨至夜間，鄒寶賢，俞可生（小寅鄉鄉長），薛順德（西安鄉保長），楊阿大陳可木等集議之下，竟慘無人道，將黃顧氏等男女老幼十四口人一併慘殺滅口。該案自經高檢處以漢奸殺人罪提起公訴，已迭經高院開庭調查，昨晨開辯論庭，鄒寶賢陳阿木提到受審，俞可生，薛順德，楊阿大均在逃。鄒立於被吿欄內，衣深灰色舊綢面棉袍，面色沮喪，陳阿木則立於鄒之右側。被害家屬顧年林等十餘人坐於旁聽席上，均係老弱婦孺，衣裳襤褸，形容枯槁，中有一小女孩五六歲，辮紥白綫，似為被害人之遺孤。</p>
<p>鄒寶賢供稱：十五條命案確有其事，惟彼等係盜匪，且出事地點在小寅鄉。陳阿木供稱：他們是強盜，曾把我從床上捆起來。經蕭庭長駁斥：你旣供毫無財產，且在人家做工，土匪綁你有何用處？陳啞口無言。嗣傳訊吿訴人顧年林作證，顧稱：年六十一歲，阜寗人，對被人遇害經過，陳述甚詳，說至傷心處，忽全身顫抖，撲通跪下，放聲大哭，語不成聲，連呼「大老爺伸冤」不止。庭丁忙將監獄醫院醫師看護請來三人照料。經檢察官請依法處斷，法院指定律師陸宗兆起立為被吿辯護後，庭論本案定十一日上午宣判。被吿請求接見家屬不准，仍押回忠監。</p>

<p>靑年女畫家李靑萍，於去夏在申舉行畫展後，即以漢奸罪嫌遭捕入監，曾一度審訊，其再審何日，尚無預定。當靑萍初審時，曾鼓其如簧之舌，對法官作各種巧妙辨辯答，有「生平以藝術為命，有藝術何必為奸」之語。記者為明瞭其鐵窗生涯，特往提　橋女監探詢，經監課長之准許，由監察科庄主任領導參觀。漢奸女囚，居於二樓，係數人合居一間，房間地板，皆極清潔，室內並置有平舖及抽水馬桶等。因女奸未決犯，奉上峯之令，禁絕參觀，故記者僅能立於總欄之外，向門內觀望。小窗內第見李靑萍，身着淺藍西服，面　容較開審時更為清癯。據記者詢悉，此中不得看報，亦不得携入書籍，當然更無從作畫消遣。李靑萍之生活，早起晚睡，隊晨間至樓頂晒台行一次早操外，惟與同室奸犯說說談談，以度永日。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦三日電〕當代中國木刻展覽會，由中國宣傳部發起，今日已在此間中國學會開幕，會期預定三週。所陳列作品，係中國木刻作家協會所搜集之戰時木刻。展覽目的，在「使英國藝術同志，獲知中國在戰時如何利用木刻，以及中國木刻藝人如何不顧環境之惡劣，仍活躍從事藝術」。此項木刻係四十餘人之作品，大多非職美木刻家，實則其中有晝家，有彫塑家，亦有以木刻作為消遺者。諸藝人旣非職業專家，兼以在戰時缺乏必需工具器材，致工作極為困難，益使此項展覽生色不少。所陳列之木刻不下一百十八件，其中有二十件，出諸王芝（譯音下同），十三件盧田，七件辭子文之手。題材作風，各各不同，足證中國木刻家已臻極高標準。同時，關於中國及其人民生活之種種情狀，亦在木刻中活潑呈現。蒞會參觀者，目睹作品風格之高，寫實之逼眞，莫不動容。</p>

<h3>海陸靑瘋狂進襲巨人隊力戰敗北　華聯五虎勝鐵路京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽，昨晚三塲，女子組女青紫勝力隊，四十四比十七，已無關大局。男一組海陸青勝巨人，番軍同室操戈，巨人因健將皮高奈未來，谷佛上半時缺席，大受影響，結果五十三比四十八。末塲甲一華聯六十四比三十九勝鐵路京。三塲以番軍一戰最精釆，五百餘觀衆興奮異常。</p>
<p>女靑紫勝力隊</p>
<p>女青紫錢楚屏開紀錄，朱錦芸罰中，力隊顧麗倩迎獲五分，反成三比五超出，迨女青紫楚屏務　華屋各獲一球，首節以十一比五勝，第二節三人又獲十一分，力隊困守無所得，成廿二比五。第三節尙覺緊張，比數為卅四比九，第四節完畢，女靑紫以四十四比十七勝力隊。</p>
<p>海陸靑勝巨人</p>
<p>人與海陸靑之戰，巨人因谷佛與皮高奈缺席，全隊似失靈魂，凱捷密洛夫亦戎裝登塲，仍難擋海陸靑之瘋狂襲擊。海陸海福魯克及彼得瓊中十三分時，巨人祗三分，浮尼克擲中三球，罰進二分，仍復懸殊，上半時海陸靑以廿七此十五大佔優勢。</p>
<p>下半時谷佛趕到，強杜萊入易N沙司金，滿擬重整旗鼓，起死回生，浮尼克谷佛各中二球後，分數漸接近（三十二比二十三），陶勃令基善鑽營，三十五比二十七時相去已僅八分，巨人暫停，欲謀一舉，浮尼克運球入內建功，强社萊繼之，三十七比三十一差六分，此際兩軍肉搏，動作有似摔角，海陸靑彼得門為全隊柱石，指揮作戰，於緊張局勢下鎭靜應付。報吿最後四分鐘時，為四十八對四十一，一分卅秒時，五十三對四十六，福魯克犯規畢業，由勃司　接替，最後三秒鐘，勃又問病，四人戰終塲，結果為五十三比四十八，海陸青勝來頗吃力。</p>
<p>華聯勝鐵路京</p>
<p>華聯對鐵路京作第三塲比賽，華聯吳成章陳學崇包松圓競爭投籃，高縣八分，鐵路京方由楊賢　破紀録，上半時卅一比十四，球迷見缺少刺激性，泰半引退。</p>
<p>易籃再戰，華聯張良雄調出陳學崇，昨晚李震中便衣坐記分板下作壁上觀，三十七比二十時，學崇易出松圓，此後鐵路京蔣國平盛東愚等，得分頗足與華聯對抗，但華聯根深底同，仍以六十四比三十九擊退鐵路京。</p>

<h3>滬星乒乓隊　月中南片港澳</h3>
<p>滬星乒乓隊自經瞿堯康君於去歲組織成立以來，曾先後與本市中西首流各勁旅父綏，皆獲全勝，戰績燦爛，該隊原擬出征美國，惟因種種問題，未得解決，乃吿擱淺最近滬星隊決定先行出征香港，澳門，及廣州三地，此事已由領隊瞿堯康君接洽就緒，瞿領隊原定昨日先行搭中航機首途赴港，臨時因香港氣候縣劣，改於今晨九時卅分起飛離滬。</p>
<p>昨日下午三時二士五分，市長吳國楨氏因滬星乒乓隊出征美國及華南事宜，有所垂問，將電召瞿堯康至市府面詢，吳市長對滬星乒乓隊之出征，頗為關懷，為便利該隊起見，特由外事室繕就證明函件，分致港澳兩地總督及廣州市長等，至於出征美國之護照問題，允於征港完畢後，向交外部設法請領，並對該隊此行勗勉有加，三時三刻許吿完畢。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽，兩隊番兵勁旅相逢，昨夕市體青館上座祇六成，可謂意外，其　識貨球迷，不應錯過這一塲大戰。</p>
<p>開賽時，巨人因谷佛誤卯，無法防止海陸靑長人中鋒福拉克之籃下奪球，致使福拉克與勃洛克如探囊取物，比數由十比一，十九比三，更創二十六比八之形勢。</p>
<p>十三比三以後，巨人諸將陷於慌亂，頻施無的放矢之遠射，陶勃林基中距離投籃十九偏失。此際的巨人，完全崩潰，祗有挨打，談不到防守策略。</p>
<p>上半時海陸靑領先十二分之多。下半時之始，谷佛趕到，巨人多一長人，獲球權反而佔得優勢，浮尼克專一在本籃監守福拉克，兩人相差祇兩英寸。谷佛負責策動反攻，與浮尼克互有投中，比數自三十比十五，迫成三十比二十一，三十五比二五時，陶勃林　，浮尼克各入一球，巨人祗落後六分，尙餘九分鐘，是昨賽平反敗勢唯一良機，惜巨人無法控制利用。</p>
<p>迫至五十三比四十六時，福拉克犯滿出塲，時間祗餘一分鐘，未幾勃洛克亦罰出，巨人僅由凱撓密洛夫增兩分完塲。</p>
<p>倘谷佛始終在塲，局勢變幻，常難以測斷。巨人旣一敗再敗，冠軍將成華聯，海陸靑，汕隊，仁餘遂鹿之局。（昌年）</p>

<p>全國銀樓業聯合請願團，自京返滬後，曾在滬舉行各地代表大會，討論結果，所有谷地代表，除每一地留一人在滬，以利聯絡，餘均返歸原地，報吿經過。惟此次請願結果，當局雖同情銀樓業目前處境，尤以設法變通，惟該業停業已久，因職工等開支浩大，故損失頗鉅，希望當局迅速決定改善辦法。茲悉滬上一部份較小銀樓，因無法維持，宣吿淸理，尙有一部份小銀樓，已暫營紋銀買賣，及代客鑲嵌，以維目前生活。據該業中人云，如當局在短期內仍無辦法公佈，恐尙有少數銀樓被迫淸理云。</p>
<h3>保險業保費收入每月可有一百億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據全國保險商業公會聯合會理事長羅北辰談稱：渠佔計全國保險業每月保費之收入，刻已達到一百億元之目標。現保險業方面，正擬發起組織一保險之總集團，以謀吸收保費，分散危險，而又免利權外溢。又最近財部對保險業課稅辦法，亦已改進。如營業稅現已按照資本額征收，印花稅則改按分級定額稅率征收。又羅氏所倡導之中信局物價指數保險，上月份保額收入，共達四百五十餘億元。刻以生活指數已吿凍結，故該局所依據之指數，亦宣吿凍結。惟渠刻正考嗷如何按社會局逐月發表之差價，予以適當之調整云。</p>

<h3>茶業收購問題顉望早日解決</h3>
<p>政府曾於去年陰曆年底飭中央銀行收購茶葉，以舒茶商艱困，並核定收購中心價格，歷時兩月有餘，迄未實現，轉瞬淸明節屆，新茶登塲，陳貨未銷，新貨將如何發展，此項問題，非僅茶業業本身引為焦慮，即關心國際貿易者，亦甚關懷，據茶業方面稱：最近正式市面，祁門一百萬元至八中五萬元，平綠五十一萬五千元至四十六萬元，　紅六十一萬元，主辦當局旣不允要求加價，似可任令具有銷售能力之茶商備款　取押款茶業，免得遷延時日，呆滯擱置云。</p>

<p>煤市烟煤屑去路，因値配煤發送期間，市勢續趨疲軟，行市又見盤低。烟煤塊趨勢雖較穩健，然行市亦見微回。白煤塊僅高檔貨因來貨稀，市價仍穩站高峯，低檔貨亦受烟煤疲勢影響，略見回跌。白煤屑市上雖缺貨，然因平價過高，銷路亦淡。柴炭因煤市不振，各貨普遍軋低。</p>
<h3>米市消化平淡　雜糧價格轉疲</h3>
<p>昨米市來源湧旺，消化平淡，共到一萬八千餘石。粳米南北均高平次削，中下回小千餘元，白元堅定，陰元無榮辱。秈米平疲之格。</p>
<p>油市動蕩頗烈，原料下降，去路呆滯，豆油下降萬元，生油猛落二萬元，淸油猛跌二萬餘元，蔴油亦跌萬元。</p>
<p>豆餅交易寥寥，市形少神。黃豆東北長江來貨漸湧，消化淸懈，市况繼續下游，步跌二三千元。芝蔴亦見軟化回小三五千元。生仁走銷亦淡，轉疲三五千元。蠶豆呆滯之極，猛烈下瀉萬元，菉豆亦小三五千元，紅糧跟跌千天，惟赤豆則看港動辦獨呈挺秀，價升二三千元，依然俏俐。豇豆挺定，粉市因常錫本粉到貨見湧，市况轉疲，回小千元。洋米隨之平正帶軟，麩皮鄉莊納胃看望，救濟麩皮將有供應，人心虛弱，低落千元，今日各糧大都一致下瀉。</p>
<h3>首次食油配出</h3>
<p>豆油數量七千三百担</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕生海食油聯配處，自恢復配油後，刻第一循環，已配出蔴油一千一百担，豆油七千三百祖。該批食油如能在本週五以前，辦完出貨送貨手續，則本週六起，即可開始辦理第二循環之食油配售云。</p>
<p>油市平靜</p>
<p>本市食油商業同業公會，昨奉吳市長及社會局糧食科吉科長諭，略以近日滬上油市騰漲，純屬客商操縱買賣，正當民用食油，當局維持充　之配售量，決不中　，故絕不致遭受影響。深望同業速自整肅調查，勿做非法交易。公會當分別通知各同業，查照在案，故昨日油市遂轉趨平靜云。</p>
<h3>按月配售萬噸台糖維持平價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕合灣糖業公司董事長吳兆洪，頃為報載台糖配售價格，將行調整之說，有所聲明。渠稱：本公司向來恪守資源委員會平抑物價方針，歷次　售價格，不僅均低於市價，且力求穩定。而每月配售數量，亦足敷本市之需。公司配量目下仍維持每月一萬噸之數。每月平均配售四次，亦即每期仍配售四次，亦即每期仍配售二千五百噸。至公敎人員，供應食糖之事，京滬兩地經由公司分別與社會局商妥，由公司按月交糖予首都消費供應所，及上海公敎人員消費合作社，轉為平價配售云。</p>
<p>秘魯細砂又小萬元</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平軟，價格續鬆。公會劃盤秘魯細砂價為二十萬〇四五千元，又小萬元。二四租白二十二萬八千元。號貨開出汕提靑十三萬四千元至二千元，順德靑十三萬元，祝靑十二萬七八千元，共一二百包。廣帮開海用赤十三萬五千元，片靑十萬〇五千元。興化帮開貢粉白二十萬〇五六八九千元，興化赤陳高莊十六萬元，新貨十四萬三四千元。興化洋十七萬元，計三百餘件。刁靑數十包，十二萬七八千元。</p>
<h3>人絲續趨下游　市塲一片喊賣聲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲市因各絲號均須繳稅出定貨，需款幻殷，亟欲出售，故黑市塲中一片　聲，喊價續趨下游，一二〇號高山有光上午七百十萬元開盤，迄收盤做六百九十萬元，比上日降四十萬元，半光等因貨稀喊價照舊。廠經昨亦疲落，洋行無交易，B字等級報價八百三十萬元，尙無回電，用戶絲B字等級做開七百六十萬元，比上日洋行成交價小三十萬元，其餘各檔均乏做開，喊價亦小二十萬至三十萬元不等。綢貨交易仍寂，喊價大都堅持未動。</p>
<h3>本年絲綢外銷</h3>
<p>可以維持八與二之比</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕決定本年度春絲計劃之聯席會議，因央行人事之變動，召開日期現尙未決定。據中蠶公司業務處畏吿記者：中蠶之基本立塲為顧全蠶農及廠商之成本，從而協助其發展，將來貸款之數額，擬定為實際需要之九成。至於外銷方面，南洋方面可出售一部份絲織品，　對美之大宗輸出，仍以生絲為主體。以外　之獲得　　，自以　為合算，惟國　之品質與花色，不　　合於美國社會，同時美國亦有大量　廠，故其需求於外　者為原料而非成品。且以　　之生產能力　言，亦不能供應他國大量之需要。故本年絲綢外銷之此例，不致超過八與二之比。</p>
<h3>生產成本太高　腸衣出口難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自央行英磅匯率掛低以後，出口物資中與桐油遭遇同樣困難者，厥為腸衣出口商。蓋歐洲去面，腸衣之價格，原較紐約為高，由於英匯之縮短，已與紐約行市相等。依照月前紐約之市價，每副由美金六角二分跌至五角至五角二分，市况頗為軟弱。光腸之折合國幣每桶一二五〇副，約為七百八十萬元，除去運費及其他費用約一百萬元，共為六百八十萬元，但滬市陽衣之製造成本，鮮腸收購價每副為二千四百元，每種之產製成本共須七百六中萬元，故事實上已較國外市價為高，出口困難重重。查腸衣每月輸出額最低可連七百桶，每年轍出的為八千桶，計可換回美金五千二百萬元，其數目亦不可請不大。惟照目前之解救困難辦法，據業中人稱：鮮腸之收購價格，應抑低至每副二千元以內，俾使生產成本減低，廠商之生產資金盡力予以活潑，茍金融業能予以大量貨款，指定其出口結匪收回其本息，則輸出前途，當可好轉。</p>
<h3>桐油趨向下坡產地價格仍堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市某行商語記者：日來桐油市况，因英磅牌價掛低，故費往歐洲英屬各地無異打一八折，幾與紐約市價相若，如以每噸二百二十英磅計算，每市擔之折合價為四十四萬元，除去拆息稅運保險等外，每市擔之出口價格，最高不過三十四萬元。紐約市價，為美金三角七分，折合現價國幣為四十四萬四千元除去外費，亦祗能做至三十六萬元，方能出口。今市桐油，以外銷突來此一打擊，喊價雖在每擔四十萬內外，恐尙有下跌之勢，漢口昨市做價為三十九萬八千至四十萬元，重慶為三十萬元，浙江（杭州）為三十八萬元。屯溪為三十六萬元。</p>
<h3>四聯准貸五十億　收購蘇北國棉</h3>
<p>大生紡織公司前為向蘇北採購國棉，申請貸款二百億元，經由經濟部紡織事業管理委員會轉請四聯總處核辦，茲悉：四聯以國行在南通未設機構，准由國行以寄庫方式，先撥存南通中行五十億元，分交當地中交農中信四行局，按三·三·二·二比例，承放各紗廠收棉貸款，其對象按紡管會指定各廠辦理云。</p>
<h3>和平秩序未恢復以前　央行政策不致驟改　金秘書對記者發表之談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨午往訪中央銀行總裁張嘉　，適張氏尙未到行辦公，當與其秘書金侯城作一談話，渠稱：張氏就職之日，對我國目前經濟金融之見解，已有詳盡之談話發表。矧國府方頒行經濟緊急新措施方案，中央銀行當亦在整個之策略下，以完成其應擔負之使命。渠認為渦去宋院長時所施行之種種經濟措施，外界不無非議之處，惜多屬不負責任之批評。茲者以國內和平秩序迄未恢復，致國家收支，一時無法平衡。處此時期，中央銀行常難期大刀闊斧，改變以前政策。深望此次莫斯科外長會議後，整個國際間錯綜複維七關係，得以澄淸。從而使我國國內之和平秩序問題，能自意氣而步入於理智解決之途徑，則其他枝節問題，當亦能同時迎刃而解云。</p>
<h3>紗價續漲　當局吿誡仍無效果　只得提早收市</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益見高昂，緣上日紡建配售不充，引起各方買胃。加以織造廠對廿支及四十二支添配頻頻，各支一致漲起十萬至二十萬，致成交價俱已超過紡建掛牌價百分之五。經紗商業公會主席唐志良及吳股兩委員當衆吿誠同業，務遵限價買賣，庶免當軕干涉，然言雖諄諄，終不能遏漲勢，不得已乃提前　鈴收市焉。</p>
<p>棉布市况十二磅龍頭細布，初開平定，每疋仍為十五萬三千元。嗣聞紗市俏俐，又為紡建公司售布價格，以棧單較現貨為高，致買氣更强，人心堅硬。龍頭布步步上升，最後高至十六萬元，較上日漲六千元，其他各牌亦跟上三四五千元，惟一九〇美事士林現貨充斥，價做小一萬，為三十七萬元，色布嗶嘰等市則堅挺</p>
<h3>紗業公會開會硏究騰漲原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉紗市塲，自經當局規定，其交易價格，不得超過國民營紗廠牌價百分之五後，過去交易經過情形，頗能遵守規定。奈日來以谷廠開紗不多，而客帮需求股切，昨日上午十一時卅分許，市塲賣戶不多，而買戶仍多抬價收紗，有逾合法利潤百分之五之情事。市塲管理員，感覺責任太重，當請示於經監團紗布組負責人，經認為超逾合法利潤之交易，應切實取締。如今日仍有超逾情事，應暫停市一天。紗業公會聞訊後，常即於昨日卞午三時召開理監事聯席會議，咸以停市結果，或反招致紗價波動不良之後果，似非善策。當再與紗在組負責人洽詢一過，聞該負責人表示，對停市後果，亦不能負責，故決定今日仍予開市。惟紗業公會各理監事，及紗布組負責人，決定於今日上午九時卅分，召開會議，研究棉紗騰漲之原因，以便覓求解決之方云。</p>
<h3>一月份僑匯統計　較十二月約少二十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一月份僑匯總數為一，六七八，〇五九，四六五·四七元，較之去年十二月份，幾短少二十億元之多。各重要地點之僑匯數字為：紐約：國幣六二九，七一〇，五五八，美金一三七，四四〇·六元。倫敦：二六，一三七鎊八先令四便士。哈佛那：國幣一二三，二八二，八五五〇元。雪黎一三，四五九，〇八二元。加爾各答四九，六二五，五四八·五〇元。仰光：一三，〇八六，〇〇〇元。西貢：二七，七〇八，八七一·九二元。至於本月份之僑匯，因匯率調整關係，南洋各地均見提高。</p>

<h3>縉雲山下　嘉陵江畔　陪都一角風景區　北碚在建設中</h3>
<p>— 二月十八日重慶航訊　彭子</p>
<p>八年的烽煙，曾使北碚隨着渝市的蛻變而蛻變成了當時西南唯一的天之驕子，由一個鄉村的黃毛丫頭，蛻變成最摩登的現代姑娘，由一片荒蕪的廢墟，建築成了文明的城市，由一塊教育最落後的郊野，爬上了文化區域的寶塔，夏壩在它的對岸，是川省著名的「高等文化地」三壩之一，「北泉」在它左邊，是每一個人盛讚的名景。</p>
<p>文化泉源　建設大道　烽煙造成了整個西南的繁榮，重慶更成了抗戰中行政商業的總匯，億萬人由那流水無涯的揚子江上，來到這霧底季節籠罩下的山城，而更有億萬人又轉來北碚，多少人在這兒留下匆匆旅途的生命痕跡，多少人在這山環水繞的懷抱裏，度他們優遊的歲月。</p>
<p>北碚，活力裏充滿了生命底泉源，這一塊嘉陵江畔景物柔美的風景區，擴大了，在政治上獨立成了一個省轄的機構－北碚管理局，於是，這地方一度是「廬山第二」黨國要人，文壇詩翁，在這兒作「江畔小居」，或許是「覓勝書古」。有名的文化區，風景區，陌生的人會把這兒幻念成一個不能擋畫的奇跡，遷來的若干高等學府，都為這巴山蜀水中的一角，艱苦的開闢着文化的泉源。</p>
<p>今日，復員東遷了，或許帶去了更多的北碚人口，可是這一所被文化陶冶了的城市，正走上工業繁榮下的建設大道，大石樑水力發電廠的龐大工程，渝碚直達電車道，嘉陵大橋，這一些：都是値得提起的。</p>
<p>電化川東　端賴北碚</p>
<p>繼VVA之後，中國的每一個角落，都在積極地整頓江河，利用水力，嘉陵江是川省四水中較急的一條，自合川以下，由夏溪口而至北碚，因為水勢峻險，樑岩天成，彷若長江的三峽，縱然山勢水力都沒有那樣雄偉，但由當地土居人們的呌法，把這兒稱作了「小三峽」，也就是嘉陵江上之三峽，先後經美水利家及我行政院水利委員會特派之若干專家考察勘測，可以利用該處水力，修建成一龐大的水電廠，上北碚之一條大石樑上作起點，築堤基洞三個，每個深五十公尺，堤上工程為一百四十萬石方，全部工程三年可完成·洪水時可發電八萬瓩·淺水時發電六萬瓩，所有施工用需用費經民生公司總經理廬作孚氏接洽，決定由民生公司，資源委員會及加拿大政府三方投資，以目前生活水準估計，需美金八百萬元，已在美訂購發電機八架，每架一萬瓩，致主持該項工程之專家，由加政府及我行政院選派，刻由北碚管理局發動民工先修堤基，約明春可正式開工，這一座嘉陵江上的水電廠完工後，可能供渝市及嘉陵兩岸各縣之電，而使川東一帶，成為小電氣化之世界，同時可調劑嘉陵江兩岸之水旱災，在小三峽上游，可以行駛三千五百噸以下航行內河的大輪船。</p>
<p>發展北碚電化建設的原則下，計劃修建一渝碚直達電車道，自北碚大石樑水電區旁為起點，渝市東郊為終點，循直綫，全程僅四十公里，車程僅兩小時可達，所有施工費用及方案，由北碚及渝市當局分擔，亦可於明春動工了，對於公教人員，將以八折或半票優待，使未來的北碚，成為渝市公教人員的週末消遣所，使未來的北碚，成為川東電氣化的中心。</p>
<p>興建大橋　增修勝蹟</p>
<p>嘉陵江南北兩岸，向無貫通河上的大橋建設，故北碚地方當局，擬興建嘉陵大橋一座，使貫通北碚與夏壩間之直接交通，已於數月前開始測量，最高洪水位為五十二呎，最低水位為八呎，全長約一千公尺左右，利用水電廠旁之水內石樑為東岸橋基點，現已着手動工，個塡兩岸橋座之石方，一年後可竣工。</p>
<p>林泉勝景之古蹟風光，為北碚成風景文化區之唯一的優點，除北泉另設有北泉公園管理處外，對於北泉所有古蹟名勝，都經民生公司總經理廬作孚先生及當地士紳吳從局先生，出資修築，大部都完好，實有蔚然可觀之狀，一般遊人，憑覽勝景，皆有優美戀念之感，唯尚有少數勝蹟，若公園最高峯之飛來閣，業已殘破，由該處俯視公園外景，宛若略案，閣下之白鳥亭，曾經於右任院長題名靑山綠水白鳥亭，亦準備再加修飾，而成為標準的重慶市的公教人員的週末消遣所，北碚新建了國民會堂，規模偉大宏美，僅少冷暖氣管之設備。</p>
<p>體育文化的展望，是本着舊有的良好基礎予以擴充：可以分兩部份來說。一為添設「平民體育塲」之各項設備，加增室內各項，并經常舉行體育運動會。擴展圖書及科學館：「北碚圖書館」，是北碚一個精神食糧總庫，藏書四十餘萬冊以上，且有若干現已絕版之書籍，實際上該館為「民生公司員工圖書館」最近北碚當局之邀而遷，蓋亦北碚主政人與廬作孚氏之幼北，故在北碚建設方面，實民生公司功績為首，今後更準備擴大，而成為川省之標準圖書館，北碚科學館，今易名「中國西部博物館」，物藏豐富，舉凡西部及國內有關之各項特產收集，確係應有盡有，尤以礦產及機械展覽室內之大規模型，實屬精妙，擬再擴大並充實之：為北碚建設方案重要之一，加拿大政府最近吿廬作孚氏，將贈給「中國西部博物館」最新式之小型機械模型一座，不日，即可交民生公司新輪帶回，在充實北碚文化發展之一大幫助。</p>
<p>擴展工業　開發礦產</p>
<p>北碚轄區內原有川省最大之採礦組合—天府煤礦公司，在北碚轄區白廟子及厚風岩等處開採，公司有自用鐵道，長三十公里，開採量及礦產之精，蓋為川省之冠，又富源煤礦公司，在北碚北之夏溪口，城區西部有大明紡織廠，佔地約百畝，擁有工人數千人，都可因「大石樑水電廠」之發電，而予以擴展，使北碚成為電氣化，工業。</p>
<p>充實北碚之各級幹部，成為未來北部的中堅人物，也是北碚當局最注重之要政之一，過去的文化開墾，已給打下了一個基礎，社會部北碚兒童福利區，修設完美，是小學教育中一個模範，中學有在川東負盛名兼善中淡定，是廬作孚氏辦的，也可說是北碚當局間接主持，另外若國立女師附中，勉仁等立信高商職校等，高等教育有夏壩之相輝學院，皆為北碚當局理想的建設幹部，同時，舉辦地方當局之公立學校，亦為計劃之一部。</p>
<p>「建設北碚，電化川東」，只須三年後，便可實現，地方當局，刻正盡他們最大的力量，展望着璀璨的未來。</p>
<h3>民食調節機構的隱憂　鎭江麵粉廠一瞥</h3>
<p>— 鎭江二日快訊　本報記者各香林</p>
<p>鎭江麵粉廠，是省會唯一的大工廠，記者於日前特往該廠參觀，由廠方派陪同在廠內各部門，作了一次巡禮。</p>
<p>外觀雄偉　環境幽美</p>
<p>該廠廠址，在鎭江的西北，佔地五十餘畝。廠屋建築，相當宏敞，有容納每天出產七千袋麵粉機器的五層鋼骨水泥的大機房，矗立在新河河干，就鎭江來說，榀算是最高最大的建築了了。大型的倉庫，共約十餘座，都拱衛在這在機房的前後左右，可以容納近二十萬大包小麥，三十萬袋麵粉和十萬大包的麩皮。此外，尚有物料食醫療隊，修理間，拉絲間，辦公室，和供和工友住宿的工友宿舍四十餘幢，但因職員宿舍一部份被軍警借住，廠內不免鬧房荒。該廠後鄰是久已停工的酒精廠，再後便是名勝地的金山寺，前鄰是火柴廠，故該廠不僅外觀雄偉，環境也非常的幽美。</p>
<p>六部設備　尚稱完善</p>
<p>廠內設備，分動力，清麥，製粉，打包，修理等六部。動方部有五二〇匹及一七五匹馬力的柴油引擎兩座，六百八十匹的馬力馬達一座。製粉部，僅鋼磨一部機器的設備，亦尚可用，在現代的眼光下，這些機器雖然多半不算新穎，但在工業落後的我國，目前在京滬一帶，則仍不失為設備完善的工廠之一。</p>
<p>交通運輸　相當便利</p>
<p>還有一個特有的優點，就是它建立在新河的右岸，麥船可以直達廠門，鎭江火車西站及江邊車站，都相距不遠，載重卡車更可直達廠內，交通運輸非常便利，其裨益於業務，實非淺鮮。不過，據說新河在春季水涸，船隻不易進內－很希望水利當局注意到今後疏濬的問題。此外，該廠與江北小麥產區，僅有一江之隔，平時在原料供應上，確佔有地理上優先使得，便在目前蘇北尚未十分安靖的今日，自不免受有相當的影響。</p>
<p>由糧食部　直接管理</p>
<p>據該廠的負責人語記者：該廠始創於民國二年，原名貽成麵粉廠，直至民國二十五年始粗具規模，在抗戰期間，業主因無力經營，全體股東宣吿解散清算，遂售與日商新井洋行，旋即加股擴大營業，並更名為鎭江麵粉廠。勝利後，該廠由糧食部接管，即交由江蘇田賦糧食管理處直接指揮監督，並派由田糧處副處長洪其琛兼任廠長，沈恒山為副廠長，下設總務，業務，工務，物料，會計等六課室。現共有職員五十餘人，分工合作，管理上也相當嚴密，、</p>
<p>馬力有限　產量不多</p>
<p>在目前工業普遍不景氣的浪潮襲擊下，各廠頻遭困難，鎭江麵粉廠自亦不能例外。據聞該廠在接辦之初，相當的艱難，首如流動資金的籌措，其次因鎭江電力的不能大量供應，幾經設法，幸該廠備有柴油引擎，趕修整理，添配零件，遂改用柴油推動機器，慘淡經營，終於在去年四月十四日正式復工，磨製出了勝利後的第一袋麵粉。可是柴油引擎的馬力有限，僅能拖動全部機器的三分之一，計每日生產量可達三千袋左右。自開工迄今，該廠在軍糧供應民食調劑和難民救濟各方面，確實盡了不少的力量。該廠因為動力不足的限制，機器宋能全部開動，故所需用的直接技術工友，亦僅及百餘人，現時碼頭夫役，臨時雇工，以及間接工友等，共計約二百餘人，連職員不及三百人。但估計直接間接靠這一所麵粉廠維持生活的，當在三千人以上。可見工廠的大量開工，對於解決社會失業和難民救濟問題，亦自有莫大的幫助。</p>
<p>採料不易　銷路呆滯</p>
<p>可是現在，該廠在業務上，也不免和各地麵粉廠一樣的遭遇到當前的困難，第一是原料採購不易，有時供應中斷，就不免停工，而在停工期間，各項開支，分文不能減少，如果停了工，廠方就難以賠墊，勢必無法維持。其次是產品（麵粉）出口貨少，銷售呆滯，資金無形凍結，整個業務將不免陷於癱瘓狀態。這是該廠目前最感到困難的一件大事，很盼望各方面拿出力量來搶救這個民食調節機構的危機才好。</p>

<p>人造火油易惹巨禍</p>
<p>編輯先生：邇來火災屢現，市民生命財產損失慘重，與其事後糾舉，何不未雨綢繆，統計歷次火災之起因，頗多係因燃用火油所引起者，得慾熏心之奸商經銷人造火油，以圖厚利，用戶不察，　以為廉，競相購用，不知等於引火自焚，後悔莫及！因人造火油之原料為柴油，蘇拉油，或松香水，再加汽油等品製成，其中如不加汽油，則臭味重，火力弱，燈蕊硬，浪費多，故必需加具高度揮發性之汽油以圖掩飾，但燃用稍久，油壺受熱，汽油即易膨脹化氣而發生爆炸，以致禍發不可收拾，非但自身受到損失，並且禍延鄰居此事為害，可以深入農村鄉鎭，故應嚴加注意。所以購買火油時必須注意品質，尤其近日市上僭稱平價火油，售七八百元一斤者，俱是具有高度危險性之人造火油，因為美孚等公司之批發價每斤即合一千一百餘元，決無賣價低於成本之理，市民切不可貪賤購用，正本清源之計有三：（一）市政當局嚴格取締製造及販賣人造火油之廠商。（二）警局應派員遍查各火油零售商，並接受市民之檢舉，如有買賣或　藏人造火油者，應以妨害公眾安全論罪（三）市民應互相勸吿鄰居勿買人造火油，以保自家安全，如發覺店鋪有滲雜人造火油者，即在公德立塲上提出檢舉，並廣為傳吿，其實，火油買客大多是就近的，萬一引起火災，對店鋪本身亦可能波及，並且即使靠人造火油發了財，也是以別人生命財產換來的，不義之財理無久拿，請三思之！（明）</p>
<h3>富國利民木材　柚樹種法　亟盼國人廣泛試種</h3>
<p>— 農林部專門委員　劉君諤</p>
<p>卅三年多，鄙人應英印政府之聘，由蓉轉渝飛印，在達拉度皇家森林研究所內担任蛀蟲研究工作。達拉度位於嘉馬拉亞山之南山麓，約當北緯三十度上下。氣溫與上海略相彷。鄙人見該所植樹試騐區內種有柚木樹一大片，達數百株之多，均元枝椏，但矗立十餘丈高，當時即曾特別加以注意。</p>
<p>查柚樹為一種實貴木材，種植易而成材速，木質堅硬細密，天然淺黃褐色，最優之點為任何蛀蟲不能蛀蝕。不獨可製床·櫃·家具及鏡框等裝飾品，且能做建築材料，國防用材，鐵道枕木，及製造船身等用途。售價頗高種之者獲利豐厚。英國政府除在其熱帶屬地各處試種成功外，並在印度北部亦試種成功。已定有計劃，每年在緬甸增植一千五百英畝，在印度增植四千六百英畝。其歷任駐印中央森林官對於柚木種植之研究，均著有專刊，其富國利民可想而知矣。</p>
<p>達拉度研究所內官員職員住宅之房頂板因白蟻為患，每三五年必需換一次。否則不免有墜落之虞。惟「官員招待所」及所長住宅兩處之樑柱門窗，頂板地板及一切木料部分完全為柚木所製，從無白蟻蛀蝕之患。</p>
<p>印緬柚樹天然分佈區，約為北緯五至廿六度；人工增植區則約為北緯廿至卅度。英人試種旣獲成效，則我國之康，藏，川，鄂，皖，浙六省之南部，及雲貴兩廣湘贛閩七省之全部，必均宜於柚樹之種植。且我國不獨川滇兩廣及福建早有白蟻，近二址年來，上海，鎭江，杭州，南京等地亦漸有白蟻之傳入。勝利復員以來，公私機關及人民由西南東歸者在其木箱木器內勢必傳來不少。鄙人因此亟欲將此寶貴有用之柚樹傳入我國，使成為國產木材。故於三十四年冬將離達拉度研究所之前一二月，特託該所內中央森林官代購柚樹種若千磅。承其向鄙人索通訊處，願俟三十五年春季柚樹收種後，命其屬員寄贈。今果收到一蔴包，至堪欣慰。今將該柚樹種之種法摘要譯錄於後，以使國內森林機關及個人願意試種者，可以函索試種：（通訊處：上海五原路華邨二弄三號。）</p>
<p>（一）浸種：自二底三初起，將種籽浸於淺鉢內水中三天，去水置日光中曝晒三天，再浸三天，再晒三天。如此反覆浸晒，經過一月左右之久，即有發芽之意。</p>
<p>（二）整地：在浸種期中，應擇明朝南，踢光充足，土壤肥沃地方，築鬆至一二尺深，澆水使潤濕，備用（土田如有草根碎磚應全除去，如有任何幼蟲應跳斃）。</p>
<p>（三）下種：種子將發芽時，將所整之地縱橫各劃綫若干道。每二綫之距離均為五寸。在在每二綫交叉點上，挖一約墳深之塘。每塘內放入種籽一粒。加土約一寸厚蓋好。如欲助其早發芽，可再加蓋稻草少許。塘內土壤須常保持潤濕，但不百積水。</p>
<p>（四）定植：在下種後，須預擇朝南，陽光充足，土壤肥沃地方一塊，築松至一尺深，常常灌水使潤濕。俟幼苗長成三至七寸高，且有一二對或二三對嫩葉時（約經一至三月之久）即可移起定植。使每二株縱橫相距均為六英尺。不到一年工夫，即可高至丈餘。（每一粒種子內，可出三·四幼苗，但在每一株之地位，只留一苗，餘者搯除。）如有野草欺凌，應予拔除。</p>

<h3>關於張錫賢君的十三味藥「肺病驗方」</h3>
<p>— 牟允方　浙江省黨部</p>
<p>陜西鳳翔縣警察局長張錫賢，患肺病逾四年，時愈時發，前年冬季又發，吐血傾盆，羣醫束手，嗣由友人傳以十三味藥肺病特效方，連服二十餘劑後，便健步如常，又王君祖揚患肺病，愛克司光透視，左肺組織完全破壞，病勢沉重，自服此方後，即漸痊癒。張君感自身以往疾病之痛苦，欲廣播此方，以濟天下之同病者。</p>
<p>自從申報刊出後，引起不少人的注意。有些人不惜工本復油印分送，一紙風行，傳諸人口，十二月一日起胡慶餘堂等十六藥號，又捐登巨幅廣吿為上海國藥業同業公會發揚國藥驗方，救濟貧病，主辦贈藥二萬貼。十二月二十二日申報社會服務欄報導贈藥經過，自開始以來，各藥號熱烈贊助，截至十二月十八日止共計二萬三千貼。這一種仁心義舉，雖然難能可貴的，但是這張方究竟有沒有治療的特效，有沒有其他副作用，是亟待研究的一個問題。去年五月十九日申報陳存仁先生發表研究的結果，認為有滋養補肺增液袪熱養血作用的方。於六月三日申報服務欄中答覆來問，又指出原方的不合理，為了合理起見，曾將原方與以修改。所以特效之方，我也有討論的必要了。</p>
<p>我對於這張方的第一個批評，是白芷和紅花用得沒有理由，有咯血的肺病，用少量的紅花，還可以說，用白芷治肺病，是絕對錯誤的。陳先生說：「白芷一味應用時確有考慮的必要。」我認為毋須考慮，白芷為含有揮發油有刺　性的發汗藥，不但盜汗潮熱的肺病不能用，照處方的條理講來，這樣的一張方的配合中，也不應屬雜不倫不類的一味白芷，陳先生說「白芷須改為蒸百部」這是很有道理，因為百部能治久嗽，其次為藥物的用量不合道理，陳先生說：「紅花，甘草，用量宜輕，生地，　白皮宜重。」復將原方各藥的分量與以合理的修正。我認為熟地的分量也需要修正，假使熟地可以不必要，已經有了生地，索性不要用，若需要用熟地，二錢的分量也太輕了。</p>
<p>全方十三味，除了不倫不類的白芷以外，中醫叫做「甘寒」作用的方，治肺病乾咳，不眠，心煩，口乾……等虛性興奮的徵候，所謂「陰虛炎旺」的病是有效的。因為「甘寒」的藥物，都有滋養性和鎮靜興奮的作用。肺病雖然是陰虛火旺的一種病，但是病人的體質和誘因的不相同，而肺病的症候也不一律，有咯血的，有盜汗的，有潮熱的，有遺精的，有失眠的……，輕重變化沒有一定，所以單純用「甘寒」的藥，也不是都會有效。</p>
<p>（按：陳存仁君對於肺病驗方新撰千餘字長文刋二月廿八日新聞報，均從最近實驗上發揮，關心此方者宜參閱之。）</p>
<h3>切莫將下列各症　誤認為傷風　看作小毛病！</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>內經云：「春傷於風」。蓋春季氣候，由寒而轉變為溫暖；然此時寒冷未罷，暖亦方緩緩而生，其間寒暖之變化頗劇，忽而春寒料峭，忽而春暖融融，體溫之調節，最易失常，於是感冒以起，即成傷風之證。</p>
<p>傷風之輕者，或鼻塞作　，或喉癢作咳，其甚者，即惡寒而發熱，或不藥而自愈，或投以發散之劑而愈，或連投發散之劑二三日而愈。至於兼併他病，或肺部不健而生變化者，則調治之法，當較困難，然一般人之觀念，終以傷風為小毛病，認為無足輕重；不知「傷風不愈變成癆」，即所以警惕一般輕視傷風之證者。且國人於醫藥常識，大多不甚經心，於證候之識別，故亦茫然，因傷風之最大徵象為惡寒發熱咳嗽，往往以有惡寒發熱咳嗽者，誤認為傷風，因循失治，必成大變，此則不容忽視，故特表而出之。</p>
<p>風溫</p>
<p>風溫為傷寒之一，其特徵，為身熱起伏，留戀不退，一似普通傷寒之外，兼有咳嗽現象。本病於初起之時，徵覺惡寒，體溫增加，和普通之重傷風症，甚為相象，所以最易忽視，以致延誤。因為忽視之結果，不但不即調治，或且帶病工作，備疲其體力精神，消耗其抵抗能力，如引狼入室。或則飲食無忌，重累其消化工作，以致積聚不化，胃腸大受影響，熱度增加，如益薪助火。</p>
<p>傷寒忌食，此普通常識，人人所習知者，傷風之人，除食而無味，自願少食以外，則無必須忌食一如傷寒之例，故誤認之最大惡果，即為積食，傷寒論所謂「陽明病」者是也。通常稱謂「火症傷寒」「豎頭傷寒」「漏底傷寒」，皆為傷寒中之危險症候，推其由來，大多由飲食不忌所致。風溫而誤為傷風，故其後患，往往有不可設想者。</p>
<p>肺風</p>
<p>肺風者，呼吸不舒，咳嗆氣急，發熱不退，即今之所謂肺炎或氣管支炎者是也。風字意義有二：一指其病源，謂感受風寒所致；一言其證狀，謂有動風之危險。後一之意義，於小兒之患此者，最易發見，故患肺炎之小兒，往往有發驚之可能。</p>
<p>肺風之發生，因有受風寒而致者，病毒所至，肺受其害，故呼吸系統之徵象，最為顯著，在初起其證候之尚屬國淺者，不難誤認傷風。不知此症善行速變，茍不及早用藥，或用藥而不對症，皆有大變，誤及生命。</p>
<p>痧子</p>
<p>痧子初起，發熱，咳嗆，作　，鼻流清涕，直與傷風無異，迨四五日後，有紅點見於耳翼前後，及胸背等處，始知為發生痧子矣。</p>
<p>痧子最忌風寒，此人人所知者，風寒而外，飲食亦宜注意，若痧子而誤認傷風，其防範方面，即不十分謹慎，或重感風寒，束其外衛，致不能速達，或傷於飲食，大便溏泄，致乘機內陷，則痧毒內據，有頃刻生變之虞。</p>
<h3>薑</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>人衹知生姜為普通菜蔬調味品而已，然用之得法，不惟適口充腸，且能起死回生，醬姜可治嘔噁，糖姜能療腹痛，姜茶飲能止泄瀉，姜棗煎可以　瘧，葱姜麵能發汗而愈傷風，都是食養療法中，顯著成効的　品，若用以入藥，生姜能散寒發表，止嘔開痰，用火炮，則味辛中帶苦，其性則轉大熱，除胃中寒冷，炮黑，則有炭性作用，又能溫經，若以老姜　乾者，為乾姜，能溫守中宮，強心安神，其他如姜皮之能散水腫，姜汁之可除頑痰，種種妙用，不勝枚舉，生姜的辣味，不如辣椒之刺激，且能解毒去穢，故烹魚者蝦要姜，而吃大蟹無姜，亦覺索然無興矣。</p>
<h3>仙鶴草</h3>
<p>— 張延仁</p>
<p>仙鶴草原名龍芽草，俗稱脫力草，以其能療脫力勞傷故名。其效能詳載本草，向為我中醫界所重視，自一九三七年上海復旦大學醫學院教授吳雲瑞氏試驗結果，提出純粹有效成分，應用於臨床，其效更著，往者本品不但見重於醫界，然實驗之功，久為民間習用，每見鄉村中　脫力勞傷吐血者，　採自田野，曝於烈日，煎而服之，恒古奏效，考本品之性質，苦渣微溫，含有膠質，柔化合物，植物性固醇，及一種甘體，即植物性黏液素，具有消炎，收歛，增加細胞抵抗力，促進血液凝固諸作用。對於吐血咯血，鼻　，子宮出血有特效，尤其慢性虛弱患者，及大病後軟弱無力，最為相宜，常服且能強心滋補，心強則血液循環改善，面色即現紅潤，實有卻病延年之效力，夫國產藥物，何獨此品，有效者多如山寶，珍奇羅列，俯拾皆是，奈何不自改進。處今日而言建設中醫，採擷精華，改良藥物，實為一大前提，願國人共起　之。</p>
<h3>傷風預防</h3>
<p>— 沈裁之</p>
<p>（一）俗云，「春風勿著肉」，即古詩「吹面不寒楊柳風」之意，言春天之溫暖也。然俗又云：「春陰凍死老牛精」，則可見春天之寒暖失常，氣候易變，而於正二月為尤甚。故衣着方面，須注意衣服之厚薄，勿拘守時令着衣。</p>
<p>（二）陽光淡薄或氣候冷霾，自身感覺寒冷，當隨時更換衣服，切勿忍寒而服單衣。出門者，尤當注意此點，俗云：「出門常帶三九衣」，即所以防感寒。</p>
<p>（三）發汗後，體溫驟降，毛　不固。防寒力薄的。風寒易入，故勿坐臥當風，取快一時。</p>
<p>（四）外出時，衣服為雨雪所濕，宜從速設法更換，不可免強忍耐。</p>
<p>（五）夜睡被褥不可過暖，因過暖熟睡露身反易招致感冒。</p>
<p>（六）晨起，衣服未扣，切勿開窗，處在暖室者，亦勿急遞外出；最好於開窗及出門之前，以兩掌撫摩面部及前額鼻心等處，以防感冒。</p>
<h3>痧子用棉紗線攷正</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>習俗療治痧子，多用棉紗煎服之，此法在痧子初見，用以透達。余因欲明瞭其性味與功能，翻閱本草，竟付闕如：藥學大辭典，雖有透痧子之說，未能滿意。　思棉花與棉紗線，在品類上之分別，一為農作物，一為工業品固　有異；若從化學上分析之，恐無大差別。此物而果有醫藥上之效果，則花之與線，多一翻紡製工夫耳，於其本質，同未有變也，何以治痧子不用棉花，必欲用棉紗線？豈非「邱穌自有道理」乎！一日，偶閱邵琴夫「喉痧有爛喉白喉」篇，中有「勁之兩旁，腫出如　者，即俗所謂喉痧袋是也，宜加解毒退腫之品，　蠶，赤芍，射干，馬勃，生草，貝母，　桃核，靑棉紗線」之句，不禁恍然！</p>
<p>邵琴夫之所謂喉痧有爛喉白喉者，乃指爛喉痹痧與白喉痧二證，爛喉痹痧，即猩紅熱，—一名紅痧—前人與小兒所發之痧子，往往混誤不分。猩紅熱初見點時，雖較痧子細小，不日則密佈成片，喉間甚易腐爛；痧子之劇者，亦成片而喉痛，甚且起腐。猩紅熱之特證，除喉痛外，有舌尖綘而生刺，鼻與口之「三角地帶」，不發紅痧，故有顯明之蒼白色之三角形；痧子之熱重而變肺炎者，亦有此徵象，棉紗線之本用於爛喉痹痧者，故亦用之於痧子矣。</p>
<p>然棉紗線之治　痧，乃為喉症而施，且不特喉爛，外亦發腫。觀篇中所云「宜加解毒退腫之品」，則棉紗線之作用，在於解毒退腫，與痧子之透發無涉也。</p>
<p>且用棉紗線宜特別注意之點，乃「靑」棉紗線，而非普通之「白坯」也。老式染坊，靑色用靛靑，靛靑能解毒退腫，故治「喉痧袋」用靑棉紗線者，即取其靛靑之力也。</p>

<h3>戲曲論叢題記</h3>
<p>— 葉德均</p>
<p>去年冬天，把過去十多年來所寫的關於中國小說戲曲的論文及隨筆，整理一下，估計約有二十多萬字。其中許多短篇隨筆，多半是為適於副刋的篇幅而作的劄記，準備功夫都不很深，這類零星的篇章，實在沒有災梨禍棗的必要，毅然地把牠全部删去。所存的論文，也只十三四萬字，編成一册「俗文學論集」。「日新文學叢書」預備把牠收入，但為了字數的限制，難以囊括全部。所以先抽出論曲的幾篇，編成一册「戲曲論叢」，讓牠先和世人相見。其餘考訂小說，彈詞的幾　，另輯一册「魚衣集」。</p>
<p>這本五六萬字的薄薄小册子，只有六篇文章，雖不免近於單薄，但我仍然喜歡牠。我以為：與其寫槪論，大綱之類的什麽，不如脚踏實地寫點專題研究；寫一本沒有創見的文學史之類，還不如一篇堅實的小考證。這自然只是我的想法，未必能使別人贊同；然而，我自已却喜歡走這迂闊的道路。雖然這幾篇短論考訂未必詳盡，但我總願竭盡我的力量使牠充實。自然也有未曾注意到的文獻，像「太平樂府」的作者吳震生，我沒有想到李極「耆　類徵」中竟有他的傳記。這種遺漏不免是個疏忽，而考訂之難於求全，凡是經歷過的必然深知其中的甘苦。</p>
<p>自己是毫無藏書的人，更難說什麼孤本，珍本之類，而弄小考證又必要書籍做根據，感受的苦痛更深。那篇「演長生殿之禍」所徵引的書籍都是淸代普通的文獻，但假如沒有某省立圖書館可供參考，也許到現在也寫不成。曾搜集不少有關老郞及明人對戲曲狂熱的文獻，可以寫成不很短的論文，但終因一兩部明刋的書籍沒有覓到，只好讓牠擱淺。輯錄明代戲曲作家史料的半途而廢，也和上述的情形相彷彿。無書的考證，要想有豐富的收穫，怕是要成虛願了吧。多年困居南中，還有什麼可說？什麼時候纔能利用那曾經留連不忍捨去的金鱉玉　橋旁那座圖書館？這更是難於逆料的事了。專弄這類東西雖未免自我苦吃，但就一己力之所及，還想繼續弄下去，結果如何當然是難以預測的了。這正是：稗山曲海等閒事，且鑽韋編了此生。</p>
<h3>夢痕</h3>
<p>— 楊依芙</p>
<p>在我的回憶裏，彷彿是奏着一曲音樂，像是蕭邦的「小夜曲」，它充滿了藍色的情緒，激動着我破碎了的心弦——那深深的戀情，深深的憂鬱，那無限的機綿，無限的哀愁，使我惆悵，使我感傷，甚至於使我落淚。</p>
<p>我不曾忘記過這一個黃昏，那是在一九四三年的深秋。</p>
<p>瀟瀟的細雨，颯颯的冷風，點綴着悄悄的黃昏。病後的我靜靜的躺在床上，我凝望着窗外惱人的天色，是那麼的凄淸，那麼的冷落，而又是那麼的寂寞。是的，寂寞，我感覺到從來未有過的寂寞，思潮不斷的起伏，碎碎屑屑，斷斷續續。我在思索着：什麽時候我才能恢復康健？什麼時候我才能到學校上課？祖國正在風雨飄搖之中，許多人正在奉獻他們的生命，而我，却在疾病痛苦中掙扎，…我不禁又想起了我的許多朋友，想起了他們給予我的溫馨的友情，尤其是華華，他待我太好了，想起了他，使我聯想到無夜裘的明月，大海中的燈塔。他帶給我溫暖，帶給我光明，帶給我希望。使我忘記了不少的痛苦，减少了許多的寂寞。這時，我才深深的領悟到「得一知己，死而無憾」這句話，……</p>
<p>忽然，一陣淸脆的電話鈴聲，打斷了我的思潮，驚破了沉寂的氣氛。我便立刻從床上起來，走到書桌的旁邊，拿起了聰筒，便聽見了舅舅的聲音：</p>
<p>「……是依芙麼？這兩天怎麼樣？身體好點了沒有？」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，舅舅，我好點了，……你找媽媽麽？她出去了，有什麽事沒有？」</p>
<p>「她出去了。……那末，請你吿　她，把我的那兩隻皮箱理出來。今晚我要來拿的。」</p>
<p>「什麼？舅舅，你就要走了麼？那麽快？」我又急急的問他：「那末，華華他們呢？」</p>
<p>「他還沒有吿訴你麼？我們早就約好一起走的……」</p>
<p>「這是眞的麽？華華也一起　　？……」我　聽見「華華也一起走」這名　，其餘　再說些什麽我　　　　了。終於，　把電話掛斷了。「我不相信，我不相信，他沒有說過就要走，這是不可能的，華華不能離開我，我要去看看他……」我如瘋如在的自語着。連忙穿上了衣裳，披上了大衣，便向樓下走去。這時，我已經忘記了我自己還是一個病人，是一個須要靜養半年才能恢復康健的病人。當我在開大門的時候，看顧我的老媽子很驚奇的走出來問我：「依芙姑娘，您幹什麼呀？」</p>
<p>我沒有時問同她解釋，我急急的對她說：「我現在要出去，等會吿訴媽媽，我立刻就回來。」我連忙把門關上，祗聽見她在門內喊我，可是，我已奔出大街，跳上了一輛三輸車。</p>
<p>雨已經停了，風不住地在狂吹着，我失了知覺地坐在車上，不知過了多少時間，車子已駛到善鐘路口了。下了車，走進一條小巷，我輕經地按着門鈴。</p>
<p>「誰呀？」那是華華的聲音，我聽得出來。</p>
<p>「是我，華華。」我情不自禁地喊着。</p>
<p>「誰？依芙？你怎麽會來的？」他驚愕地走出來，握住了我的手。</p>
<p>「我以為你已經走了……：」忍了許久的熱淚，已掛在我的眼角，這一剎那，我好像得着宇宙的一切。</p>
<p>「沒有，我不是好好的在這兒嗎？」他溫柔而又沉着地說：「依芙，你怎麼忘記了你還在養病，……好了，不多說了，快點，我這就送你回去。」說着，他挽着我，忽忽的又坐上了一輛三輪車。</p>
<p>天色已經向晚，暮靄蒼茫中，路燈漸漸的亮起來了。</p>
<p>「華華，我請求你不要離開我。我偎倚在他的身邊，輕輕地說。</p>
<p>「依芙，我吿訴你，」他慢慢的說，一字一字的擊在我的心坎上，「假如你不是在生病，我早已奔向自由的天地去了，為了你，我才延遲到現在。」</p>
<p>「眞的麼？華華，謝謝你，但是，我害怕，我怕我將會失去了你。」</p>
<p>「你為什麽這樣說呢？」他凝注着我：「請你相信我，依芙，當我第一次看見你的時候，我就喜數你，我對你還有一種不可理解的心情，那是愛慕，是崇拜，是尊敬。我祗是平凡中的一個最平凡的人，然而，我有我的理想，我有我的信念。為了祖國，我要緊守着我的崗位，盡我的本份。依芙，我希望你能够瞭解我，而給我鼓勵和安慰。」</p>
<p>我拾起頭，凝視着他，熱淚已一滴滴的落下來；「華華，我懂得你，請你原諒我剛才的自私。」</p>
<p>「不要那麼說，今後，我將要為你而更努力。」</p>
<p>「華華，你去吧，我願你能够完成你的理想，我沒有什麼可說的了，我祗直替你祝福，華華，請原諒我，我實在沒有勇氣再想下去了……」</p>
<p>「依芙，你不要說得太遠了，等你身體康健了，我再出來接你去，那時，我們便可以一同工作，一同生活了，你高興麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，我也這樣希望，可是，誰知道將來……」</p>
<p>「相信我，依芙，我不會忘記你，我永久不會忘記你，」他熱情地說着。</p>
<p>車子已停在江寗路，我們下了車，站在街邊的路燈下，在矇矓的夜霧裏，他緊緊的握着我的一雙纎手說：「你應該替我高興，為什麼傷心流淚呢？答應我要好好的休養。」</p>
<p>我微微的點點頭，張開了充滿淚水的眼睛，凝注着他說：「你一定回來接我麼？」</p>
<p>「是的，過些日子，我一定回來接你。」說完，他便吻着我的濕潤的面頰，「你快點進去吧！不要站在街上了，你會着凉的。」</p>
<p>「不，今天我要看着你先走。」我含着淚水微笑的對他說。</p>
<p>他知道我的個性很倔强，所以他說：「好的，那麼我先走了。」他便向前走了。忽然，他回轉身對我說：「你還不快點回家，街上冷得很，快點進去吧！再見！」說完，他便很快的走到對面的馬路去了。</p>
<p>「再見！」我高聲的喊着：「你明天來看我麼？……」他好像沒有聽見似的，漸漸的走得遠了。直至到他的背影消失在夜霧中，我才提起沉實的脚步走回家去。</p>
<p>回到家裏，幸虧媽媽還沒有回來，我躺下床上，感到渾身發熱，好像火燒一樣，於是，我便失了知覺地睡着了。</p>
<p>等我神智比較淸醒的時候，媽媽才吿訴我，舅舅和華華已經走了。</p>
<p>之後，我便渡着寂寬的歲月，每日在家裏喫喫藥，看看書，聽聽音樂，身體也逐漸康健起來。同時，我又常常接到舅舅和華華的來信，知道他們都在前方工作，而且工作異常緊張，一時恐怕還未能回來上海。但是，他們說等有機會便設法來接我去。可是，不久，到重慶去的交通漸漸的困難了，他們的來信也漸漸的稀少了。</p>
<p>等待，等待，天天的等待着他們的信息，終於，接到舅舅最後的一封來信，寥寥的幾個字，吿訴我，華華忽然失踪了，生死莫卜，但是，這個消息還沒有證實。那簡直是晴天霹靂，我呆了好些日子。但是，我不相信，我有很强的信心，我相信這消息是不確實的。</p>
<p>終於，和平的鐘聲響遍了宇宙的每一個角落，我以半喜半懼的心情等待着他們歸來。果然，舅舅回來了，而且，證實了華華的不幸失踪消息，到現在還不知道他的下落。可是，茫茫的宇宙，呌我到那兒去找尋他呢？</p>
<p>我雖然是個倔强的女孩子，直是，我已無法抑制自己的情感，不由自主的落下了淚珠，我沒有說過一句話，祗是獨自黯然的落淚。</p>
<p>舅舅最瞭解我，他看我忍受着痛苦，不知不覺，我顯然變得消沉了，憔悴了。</p>
<p>他常常帶我到公園散步，伴我聽音樂會。可是，總提不起我的精神，我的心一天天的鬱結起來，像是在一幅潔白的布上，塗上一層層深藍的顏色，象徵着悒鬱，悲傷，和不盡的哀思。</p>
<p>一天，舅舅忽然對我說：「依芙，難道是你將永遠的悲哀下去麽？你聽我說，也許你換一個環境就會好一點，我替你找一份工作怎知樣，你願意去試試看麼？」為了他的好意，我便答應了。</p>
<p>於是，我便成了一間敎會中學的敎師，每日消磨我的時問在讀書，批卷之中，我的心緒慢慢的比較好些了。如今，我才感覺到工作確是人生的甜餅，我更瞭解人生的眞諦：世界上有些人活着是為他人，有些人活着是為自己，但是，為他人而生活的人，才能獲得永遠的幸福。</p>
<p>然而，我不能忘記華華，每在晨光　微的初曉，濛濛細兩的黃昏，或是滿天星斗的午夜，他的影子不住地徘徊在我的腦海中，繫繞着我的心靈。</p>
<p>每天淸晨，當我路進學校，走過那座小體拜堂的時候，我總抬起頭，凝望着那張掛在牆上的聖母像，我在默默的祝禱着：祝福他平安，祝福他平日歸來，雖然，沒有人知道他那天才會回來，但是，我每天都是那樣的祝禱簽，祝尋着。（卅六年元月卅日）</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　190</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>其餘還有一點，我們可以說耀羣和虎城，從W君看，兩人是處於一種聯絡機構的地位上：有了耀羣和虎城，可以聯絡到我和鶴見這一方面的所屬機構，並且東北的潛勢力，是W君應該招致合作的，這聯絡的媒介，虎城和耀羣就應當是量適常的人物。况且，虎城雖說是一個年才十二三歲的孩子，為了他那等驚人的武技和智慧，在東北各山頭，竟無人不知道，無人不佩服；所以也和耀羣一樣，是受着W君的特別靑眼。</p>
<p>這麼看來，W君對他們兩人的客氣，並不在情理以外。</p>
<p>W君聽完了耀羣的報吿，又見她已經照自己的意向，答覆了外來的電話，認為十分稱意，這才從從容容對剛才進來的靑年壯士示意，讓他報吿。</p>
<p>「……剛派出去的行動先頭哨探，都碰到了障礙，看情形似乎要準備特殊行動。……本樓瞭望崗報告，正西，西北，西南，三面忽然「凈街」，兩千米以內，似乎有敵方的警戒行動」！</p>
<p>屋子以內的人聽了這個報吿，都還能保持鎭靜，只有小虎城神色上稍有激動。他這種激動，不外兩種因素：第一種因素，並不完全由於報吿的刺戟，我從旁觀察，大的還是由於那個特殊裝置的信號所發嗤嗤的嘶聲，和閃爍耀眼的紅色燈光，使他的好奇心感到一種反應。</p>
<p>這種信號，據W君事後吿訴我們，本來是一種備而不用的裝置，宋哲元未撤退以前，根本沒有什麽可警可報的事情。就算日寇特工潛伏的惡勢力甚大，却因這裏掩護得極其嚴密，他們無從發覺，就讓他們發覺，料想也不敢到這裏來「老虎頭上動士」。如今北平一經淪陷，却沒有想到這備而不用的東西？倒是實地登台表演了。</p>
<p>這一套東西，原是部裏的技術專家佈置的；那警報的聲音不大，却異常刺耳；燈光則異常强烈，雖在白晝放出，一樣如同强度的閃電一般，耀眼生花。裝成之後，總電鈕設在總電訊室內，實君為此還下過一條命令，除了大門外，大廳上，屋頂，等等幾處瞭望崗上，發見了突變的危險，影響總部安全之外，一槪不許輕易動用。</p>
<p>像這樣刺耳的嘶聲，刺目的燈光，同時迸發，而且事前又有鶴見的種種警吿推測，無異催眠的初期暗示，呌虎城這樣沒有受過電機洗禮的鄉下孩子見了，焉能不感覺刺戰。不過也僅僅是限於覺觸上的一種刺戰而止，可並沒有絲毫畏怯的成分。</p>
<p>其次一種呌他激動的因素，可說是一種興奮表現，就像久征沙塲的一騎龍駒，或是嗅到一陣血腥，或是聽到一陣金鼓齊鳴，認為又有一塲好厮殺，於是奮靈長嘶，表示巴不得立刻就上戰塲，馳驟一番才好。</p>
<p>至於W君，聽了這些報吿，當然比較我們尤其鎭定。這種鎭定，純粹出於自然，一點也沒滲入做作，不像上海人所說「紥台型」的意思；因他早有成竹在胸。只見他略一沉吟，便拿起本樓直接電話，發起命令來：</p>
<p>「總部第一號，正西，西南，西北，發生障礙，突擊各行動支隊，按秩序出動，從正東繞路，哨探一千米，七百米，四百米；避免遭遇作戰；到中央公園第二支部優勢地點，潛伏集合，等候二次命令行動！</p>
<p>「……總部第二號；第二樓快發「福」字通吿，第三樓，「警」字通吿，第四樓「友」字通吿；第五樓恢復「散置形勢」，「冷」字準備。</p>
<p>「……總部第三號；快佈置二樓後部夾道，準備服務當値。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>自由談主編先生，兩　茅　，　為長期撰文，愧無妙想為報，轉思老馬正止蹄橋邊，昂首長嘶；其志千里。吾因仿其體制，信筆書之。顏曰：「獨泊漫談」，按「獨泊」兩字，本諸道德經第二十章「我獨泊兮其未兆」，是為序引。</p>
<p>勃葉克在他「天眞的預示」中曾說：</p>
<p>「一粒沙裏看出一個世界，一朵野花裏一座天堂，把無限放在你底手掌上，永恒在一剎那間收藏。」</p>
<p>這幾句詩歌並不像某些人所謂的雋趣。因為這裏面包涵無限的睿智。</p>
<p>「前不見古人，後不見來者。念天地之悠悠，獨愴然而涕下。」這是我們的大詩人陳子昂幽州台懷古之作，這裏面激盪着充盈兩間的悲憫和歷史的幻滅。</p>
<p>這情感是古今中外全人類所共有的。我們可以把雪萊的那首「問月」取來並觀：</p>
<p>「你這樣蒼白，是否倦於攀天和下望塵　，伶仃孤苦地飄流在萬千異己的星宿間——永久變幻，像無歡的眼找不出什麽値得駐目的東西？」</p>
<p>菊從遼遠的北國寄來一封短簡，他引迭更斯的話說：「人和人的心靈中間，都有一個不可測的神秘。」人是多麽不可刺透的一個東西；「痛苦」兩個字，個個人的都相像，但是各個的本質，就彼此無法了解了。</p>
<p>我突然想起，前三年的盛夏，在重股一個晚上，我和菊坐在門口納凉，我呻吟兩句詩：「隔岸繁燈火，光輝不渡江。」</p>
<p>冷塲—彼此一個長時間的沉默。</p>
<p>「你瞧對岸的燈火，一叢一叢的，目然成為許多小組，然而，最貼近的兩盞燈也不知道距離得有多遠啊！」菊沉重地說。</p>
<p>天氣鬱悶得厲害，羣星閃爍在四天。</p>
<p>「天上的星也是如此，所謂相近，只是由客觀條件下的角度所感覺到的而已。人心曷嘗不如此，譬如我們……</p>
<p>我已不記得那晚上我還說過些什麽？</p>
<p>總之，星心一陣，莫辨所以。</p>
<p>那晚，　　極遲。後大坐段的時間都不曾說　。彼此都將自我沉入星海或心海裏。</p>
<p>林黛玉臨危　湘館時，正是賈寳玉的洞房花燭夜，如果臨危是人生最大的痛苦，這洞房花燭也就慘得厲害。</p>
<p>命運是多麽可咀咒的東西啊！</p>
<p>寳哥哥用親切的手掀開了希望的面幕，突然發現新娘子不像林妹妹，是寳姐姐嗎？唔，是寳姐姐啊！</p>
<p>林黛玉剛要離開塵世時，掙出了最後的聲音：「寳玉！你好！你好！」然後嚥下了最後的一口氣。</p>
<p>「被人視為最接近的兩盞心靈底燈離開得多遠啊！」</p>
<h3>可怕的顧忌</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>老年人多顧忌，因而老年的民族如我們也多了顧忌，顧忌生於對自己失去信任，因而連一個孩子一句不吉利的戲言，在老年人看來竟可摧毀他老人家的生命。</p>
<p>凡屬多顧忌的人，必然多疑心。對於一個多疑的人，任何風馬牛不相及的言語，他都可以拉扯到自己頭上來，好像中國一表三千里的攀親一探，於是說話的人苦了。</p>
<p>有這麼一位作家，他不幸而至今還生活在一個大家庭裏面，這大家庭自然男女老少都有，娶來的媳婦們，則包括東南西北，他的叔伯姑嫂弟兄姊妹，又參加了各種不同的職業。總之一個大家庭，就等於一個小小的社會，不幸的它乃是一個多疑心多顧忌的社會。</p>
<p>這位作家最近想寫小說。可是想來想去，故事要總得有一個壞人；這壞人不是男人，便是女人；不是大人，便是小孩，不是父親，便是兒子，說到他或她的職業，不是薪水階級，便是老闆，不是有職業，便是無職業。說到他或她的籍貫，不是江南，便是江北。他無論如何想開去，總跳不出這個圈子。這個壞人總像在影射着什麼人，影射了人就會引起抗議和糾紛。</p>
<p>於是在某一個時期以內，這位作家祗寫外國人，即所謂異國情調是也。可是後來他的堂兄討了一個洋婆子來了，連異國情調也干犯禁忌。</p>
<p>於是這位作家祗能寫寫烏龜與兔子了；直到現在，他的筆下祗是這些東西，而且眞（虧他的）寫得連一點人氣都沒有。</p>
<h3>上海人的行</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>鄉下人到上海來的第一聲嘆息，便是「行路難」。然則上海人又如何呢？現在讓我吿訴你，凡是畏難的都是鄉下人，眞正上海人是不怕行路難的。</p>
<p>譬如對面就來了他，祇要看他身穿新制服—墨爾登呢罩袍—就可以知道他七分是上海人了，你看行人道上摩肩接踵，人山人海，眞個是「車不得旋，人不得顧」，可是我們的上海人却悠然自得，左顧右盼，好像人海之中，他是一條自由自在的魚，即使是在車行道上，他也能擺着八字脚，表演出安步當車的姿態。在攤販堆中來來去去，他更能顯出左右逢源的本領。我說他左顧右盼，多數却並不是看貨物，而是看前前後後的女人。不過你有時候却不大分得淸楚，因為他看起人來與看貨物一模一樣。</p>
<p>現在你看他等上電車吧，他眞不急，他在路邊的水菓攤上買一個梨。那邊電車已經在過來了，可是他還要攤販替他削皮。於是他高高提着雪白的一個梨，當芸芸衆生芝蔴軋綠荳攪得上不上下不下的時候，他這條魚已經遊過人海，攢上了車子。要是梨汁沾到你身上才是你的晦氣。</p>
<p>他可不願意擠到車廂裏邊去。開電車的旁邊就是他最好的包廂。他不是一個矮子，站在這地方車子裏外都看得見，於是他一邊吃女人的豆腐，一邊吃梨，說話落門落檻，人人都賣他幾分賬。一剎那間梨吃完了，他拿出潔白的手帕，手帕以後便是牙籤。於是他幽閒地剔着牙。也許此後就這樣讓牙籤插在唇邊，也許他另外換上一支烟。</p>
<p>於是他摸出打火機來了。</p>
<p>那怕天塌下來，上海人仍舊是上海人啊。</p>
<h3>天下奇事</h3>

<h3>贈曲中人—聯語新話之八</h3>
<p>— 聽松</p>
<p>鶼巢太史，早有文名，沈氏與吾家累代世交，又戚誼重，故知之甚稔。鶼老僑滬久，與邵小村中丞相依，歷有年所，其交期實由一聯為之作緣也。蓋鶼老初至滬，邵小翁適簡任合灣巡撫，亦在滬，偶於席間相遇，中丞時眷一曲中人，名曰銀珠，意將納之後房，謂其艷若海棠，欲作一聯贈之，席間主人，深知其意，謂鶼老曰：「邵中丞行將渡臺，思得一富才華者，作人幕之賓，君有意乎？」鶼老來滬，本思謀館，主人亦知之也。於是主人為鶼老延譽，中丞亦示意請作此聯，鶼老思旣欲嵌銀珠字，又兼顧海棠之名，且寓將欲藏嬌意，頭緒繁複，頗難包括，旣而忽思得兩成語，乃足成之曰：「銀燭高燒，祗恐夜深花睡去，珠廉半捲，似曾相識燕歸來。」上聯用東坡詠海棠詩句，下聯借似曾相識之燕，作來歸之讖。天然巧合，得未曾有，然實煞費苦心，眞可謂看似容易却艱辛也。以上各聯，或輕倩，或成渾，或豪放，君相兩聯以淡勝，此以濃勝，且彼出自己無，此則代人捉刀，難易尤不可以道里計也。邵中丞閱此聯，大喜過望，更請鶼老書之金箋聯上，文旣秀妙，書尤遒美，同席咸擊節稱賞，謂寫作俱佳，余謂鶼老一生，無事不極其風趣，此聯乃風趣之允也。（下）</p>
<h3>讀「水準」—雜誌誌書報介紹之一</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>看了「水準」這個名稱，凡是愛好謙遜的人，沒有不覺得該週刋的主持人是有一點兒狂妄的。看了它的內容，又覺得他們並不那麼妄自尊大。「編者致意」道：水準「自己並沒有水準，它的水準只是它的執筆者們的水準」，它的水準要在「幸而能出若干期以後」。才漸漸形成的，這話一說，許多人倒也可以平了氣了。</p>
<p>這一期創刋號魏金枝的「將死的人」，確乎是一篇有分量的東西。他那一枝沉重的樸素的筆，用來叙述一個沉重而樸素的故事，使讀者感到每一句每一字都不輕巧。如果拿這一篇作品來當作水準的話，讀者是歡迎這樣一個純文藝週刋的誕生的。</p>
<p>除此以外，朱光潛翻譯的一篇「廻聲室」，極其韻味，袁水拍譯的休斯詩選，瑯瑯可誦。至於佐臨的「歸魂記」，第一期祗刋了三分之一，我想等看了它的演出再說話吧。</p>
<p>在這出版必須賠錢的時代，主持人竟無能出這麼一個又是純文藝又是週刋的東西，他們雖不在妄，也就够大胆了。</p>
<h3>「錦上𣸸花」</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>十年以前，小趙和我同住在東京一個公寓式的旅館裏，除了讀書之外，研討着一個人的處世哲學。他很聰明，他懂得對上用拍對下用吹的法子。他的說話，十句中間僅有一二句的眞話，其他都是鬼話連篇。他說世上的人祇有「錦上添花」，沒有「雪中送炭」；什麼是「交情」，「金錢」就是交情，除開了金錢以外的交情都是淺薄的，浮泛的，對於個人的前程是不起作用的。要得到主管人的靑睞提拔非得多用金錢應酬不可，金錢愈用得多，主管人對你的交情亦愈深，交情一深，什麼問題都可談到。在初交的時候，千萬要將自己的身份提高，不要顯出馬脚，顯出窮酸的樣子。小趙的話是反映着現實的社會性，我是懂得。但是我堅決反對這種做人的道理。「道不同，不相為謀」，我們各奔前程。</p>
<p>去年春天，為着生活程度高昂，家庭維持困難，離開了准公務人員（非公務員而是公務員的待遇）的崗位，從事經商，外行人做外行事，結果是失敗了。</p>
<p>這樣的生活程度，壓得使人透不出氣。妻啼兒號，怎麼生存。想跑到敎育的崗位，於是去找小趙。小趙做　某市黨部的書記長，同時又做着某市立中學的校長，且是敎育局長的親信人物，謀個中學敎職，以過去的交情，當可盡力設法，不會推諉。</p>
<p>小趙是滿口的答應，在各學校開學的時候，小趙的復信到了。拆開一看，說是「多方設法，不得要領，自己的學校，聘書均發一年，甚為焦灼，請多方設法，以免落空」云云，我懂得其中道理，我想謀的是敎職，不是謀的校長，且與局長亦有一面之緣，或須會「雪中逾務送炭」。於是找廳長，廠長等，結果總有點徘徊不前，找的結果，也祇有證明「錦上添花」一句話的眞確性。</p>
<h3>沙甸魚</h3>
<p>— 余忘我畫</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>大家又恢復談話，一面重新搬動桌椅，加緊準備開飯。</p>
<p>在工作了一整添之後，各人的情緒也都需要鬆弛一下了！吹口琴的大孩子倚在窗口邊，吹着「旗正飄飄」的調子，有七個穿夏威夷衫的靑年人圍着他高聲合唱。兩三個女孩子手挽手的走進洗盥室去了。就是那終年懷着濃烈的憂鬱感的盧跛子，也暫時鬆開了兩這經常連在一起的眉毛，取出一支紅印牌來，臉向窗外，悠然地抽着。</p>
<p>一會兒，樓梯上和走廊裏都起了雜　的脚步聲，夾上一陣碗碟碰撞的聲音，「衆望所歸」的晚飯終於開上來了，兩間打通了的辦公室裏，一起開了三桌飯，人倒有二十五六個，坐了便擠不下，反正他們這一班年靑人向來都不講究客套，飯碗和筷一搶到手，站着就吃；可是今兒人實在太多了，搶的結果還有一個人迎筷和飯碗都落了空，那就是慣會嘆氣的盧跛子。</p>
<p>「不忙，你們先請！我教老黃我去。唉！這兒眞窮，人多了連飯碗都拿不出來」！他丟掉了吸竊的烟尾，一些不着急地看着其餘的人像餓虎一般的吃喝。</p>
<p>工役老黃不等他開口，已經下樓給他找飯碗和筷去了。</p>
<p>盧跛子挨近靠窗的一桌去，探　一　　，想瞧瞧桌上有幾個菜。突然，靠近他的一個人用手裏的筷望門外指了一指，又對他　　眼；他汪懂是什麽意思。下去找　的老黃，無論如何不能回來得這麽快。左邊的那個門框下，露着半個人的身子，是一個女人，臉向外，只能看到半　鬈曲的長髮，半件已褪色的白底紅花的　　旗袍，和一條赤裸着的織細的人腿，底下是一只敞舊的布　。顯然她已在門外　了好半天了，因為她不說話，又背着　，所以很少人注意到。</p>

<h3>National Army Advances on All Fronts, Completely Clears the Southern Bank of the Songhua River; Communist Stronghold on the Changtao Line Also Shaken</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 4th] The National Army is still making every effort to pursue the remnants of the Communist forces. It is reported that in a single day on the 3rd, the National Army advanced an average of one hundred li on all fronts. Due to the rapid progress, the military authorities here could hardly maintain regular telephone contact with the forward units today. However, according to intermittent news, the units pursuing north from Dehui have reached the bridgehead on the Songhua River bank and joined hands with the defending troops inside the stronghold. The National Army units pursuing northeast from Dehui and those pursuing northeast from Jiutai have all reached the Songhua River one after another. The units pursuing north from the Tumuling area west of Jilin have crossed the river to the north. Therefore, as of noon on the 4th, the area occupied by the Communist bandits in this battle has been completely recovered. Except for a few defeated stragglers, there are no traces of Communist troops on the southern bank of the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Lin Biao's spring offensive has suffered a disastrous defeat, with rapid and divided retreats and greatly reduced morale. The National Army units converged in Dehui on the 3rd. The Communist forces there fled east and northeast. The National Army, which had been holding the city in isolation, was greatly encouraged and is now making every effort to pursue the remaining Communists. The National Army on the left flank recovered Nong'an on the 2nd, and another unit has advanced to the vicinity of Halahai. All fronts have made progress, and the situation on the Songhua River front has completely changed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The main force of the Communist army on the Changtao Line has suffered a terrible defeat. The elite troops of the National Army, sweeping northwest across Nong'an, annihilated a large number of Communist covering troops at Zhao's Market, twenty li north of Nong'an, at dusk on the 3rd. Currently, the National Army is pursuing the remnants of the Communist forces, and the Communist stronghold, the Gorlos Wang Mansion, on the Changtao Line is wavering.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Changchun-Mishazi section of the Sino-Soviet Railway was repaired on the 4th, and a test run is scheduled for the 5th. In addition, the reporters here formed an inspection group on the 4th to inspect Dehui and arrived at noon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 4th] The National Army, attacking from the eastern section of the Jilin-Changchun Railway, advanced into the Hewanzi station and continued to attack the Communist forces entrenched in Tumuling. By 2 PM on the 2nd, the Communist forces had been defeated, and the National Army is now advancing towards Yingchengzi. The National Army on the western section of the Jilin-Changchun Railway advanced eastward from Kalun and recovered Yinma River on the 2nd, heading directly for Jiutai. The eastern and western National Army forces will soon converge. In addition, the National Army attacking north from Ula Street north of Jilin recovered Qitamu on the 3rd. The Dehui National Army is also expanding on both the north and east sides.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] After the Liu River on the Pingmei Line was occupied by the Communist forces, the elite troops of the National Army have arrived at Meihekou. Key points along the Hailong and Pingmei Lines, such as Dongyan and Xi'an, are stable. The National Army will recover Liuhou within days.</p>
<h3>Silence on the Jinpu Line Front; Fierce Fighting Continues in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th] The war on the Jinpu Line front remained silent on the 4th.

The National Army moving north from Yanzhou recovered Luojia Village on the 4th. Taoluo Town, twelve kilometers east of Qufu, and Wangjia Village, southeast, were also recovered on the 4th. In addition, more than 7,000 Communist troops raided the area north of Zaozhuang on the night of the 3rd and have been driven back by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The war situation in the Jinan area is calm, with the main force of the Communist army advancing towards the outskirts of Qingdao. Another unit moved south from Tai'an, and the National Army is blocking them. A relatively large-scale battle is expected to occur in the Tai'an area in a few days. The main force of the Communist army there totals more than 60,000 men.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 4th] The Communist forces in eastern Shandong now number more than 100,000. Fierce battles are raging near Weixian and Gaomi on the Jiaoji Railway. More than 50,000 Communist troops began a fierce attack on Gaomi on the morning of the 2nd. As of the 4th, they have been fighting for three days and nights. The National Army is outnumbered and is still in contact nearby. The Communist forces continuing to attack Zuoshan and Yaogou Station have been reduced to 20,000 men. The situation at Zuoshan is currently unclear. Yaogou was lost and regained. The Communist forces have been increasing from southern Shandong to eastern Shandong along the Yiqing Highway, and the war will expand further.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th] The remnants of the Communist forces gathered in the Laiwu, Xintai, Mengyin, Tai'an, and Sishui areas of central Shandong have a force of approximately 70,000 men and are currently moving towards the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, apparently attempting to reinforce the outskirts of Jinan. A major battle is brewing.</p>
<h3>The War Situation in Northern Shaanxi is Progressing Favorably, Gradually Moving Towards Gansu</h3>
<p>The Situation in Various Counties South of Sui is Stable</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 3rd] Since the recovery of the Liulin and Ma areas west of Yijun and north of the Jing River in the northern Shaanxi war situation, the focus has clearly shifted towards Gansu, to the Huanjiang, Donghe, and Jianhe River basins. The Communist forces gathering in this area for combat and preparations include the First Brigade, First Regiment of the Police Force, the First Brigade, Second Regiment, the Fifth Regiment of the Police Force, the Independent Division, and the New Fourth Brigade. On the 2nd, the Communist First Brigade, with heavy artillery, harassed Qingyang. The New Fourth Brigade fled back to Xihuachi, about 25 kilometers southeast of Qingyang. In addition, the Huanglong area on the east bank of the Luo River in northern Shaanxi is reported to be tense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, GuiSui, 3rd] The Haifulong Detachment of the puppet Mongolian army has recently been seizing grain at Datan between Wuchuan and Taolin. This force has recently increased to 1,000 men, including Harqin Mongols. GuiSui has dispatched fresh troops to suppress them. The various counties south of Sui are very stable. The Communist forces have harassed Liangcheng seven times, but they were all repelled by the local militia.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>Began Broadcasting to Yan'an Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 4th] The Shaanxi Broadcasting Station began regular broadcasts to Yan'an on the 4th, which will be held every Saturday at 7 PM.

In addition, there are still remnants of the Communist army north of Heshuicheng in Gansu and east of Qingyang City. The National Army is searching and suppressing them. The war situation has reached the point where the special zone of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region only remains in Huan County, Gansu, and Yanchi County in Ningxia.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Fleeing to Central Anhui</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 4th] There was fighting near Changping, north of Peiping, last night. After the National Army swept through the coastal areas of northern Hebei on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, Communist forces have recently infiltrated again. Yanghe, south of Leting, was fiercely attacked by more than 4,000 Communist troops on the 2nd.

<h3>US Aircraft Shot at and Damaged Near Peiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 4th] According to US sources, a US transport plane was shot at by unidentified ground forces five kilometers north of Peiping at 4:15 PM yesterday. Only the fuselage was slightly damaged, and Lieutenant Howell, the pilot, was unharmed. According to Jones, the commander of the US Air Transport Command at the West Suburb Airport, Lieutenant Howell flew over northern Peiping and noticed a village on the ground appearing to be on fire. Driven by curiosity, he descended to an altitude of 2,000 meters to see what was happening and was shot at. The fuselage was hit by four bullets, and one of the tires on the landing gear was punctured. Howell did not notice any signs of ground troops stationed there from the plane.</p>
<h3>Gong Yue to be Appointed Chief of Staff</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] There was a grand gathering at Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Those attending the government reorganization included Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen. From the Democratic Socialist Party were Zhang Junli, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Sun Baogang, Wan Renqian, Tang Zhuxin, Liu Zhongyi, and Wang Shixian. From the Youth Party were Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Jiaju, Chen Xiuping, Liu Dongyan, Zhang Zizhu, Xie Chengping, and Zhang Bolun. Zhang Junli presented the Democratic Socialist Party's views on the government reorganization, which were roughly as follows: (1) The future government should be a responsible cabinet system with clear powers; (2) The power of the Legislative Yuan should be strengthened, such as reviewing the national budget; and the reorganization of the government should be effective. The Youth Party's views were still to reorganize the Executive Yuan and the National Government Committee; they also mentioned participating in local government. They then proceeded to dinner and dispersed at about 9:00 PM. Government officials continued their discussions afterward. The meeting did not yield any results today. Lei will invite representatives from both parties for breakfast on the 5th for further discussions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a luncheon on the 5th for Zhang Junli, Xu Fulin, Sun Shigang, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, and Zhang Bolun, from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, to listen to their views on the comprehensive reorganization of the government.

According to Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, they came to Nanjing to provide opinions on the institutional aspects of the government reorganization. However, only seven standing committee members of the party came to Nanjing, which is less than half, so the views exchanged at present must be finalized after they return to Shanghai. Jiang also denied rumors that the party had requested the replacement of Premier Song Ziwen. Another senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party stated that the party's suggestions on government reorganization still include adopting a cabinet system, and during the transitional period before the implementation of the constitution, the powers of the Legislative Yuan should be expanded. The Executive Yuan must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<h3>Approximately Forty Taiwanese Compatriots Killed or Injured in Disturbances</h3>
<p>Supervisory Yuan Cables Supervisor Yang to Investigate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Disturbances occurred among the people of Taipei, with reports of deaths and injuries. Upon hearing the news, the Control Yuan immediately telegraphed Yang Lianggong, the Supervisory Commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, to go to investigate immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] A telegram from the American News Agency (Associated Press) received here stated: "Citizens have now suffered 3,000 casualties." This information is absolutely inaccurate. A reporter learned from reliable sources that, as of the 3rd, approximately forty Taiwanese compatriots had been killed or injured. When patrolling military camps discovered Taiwanese people destroying houses and beating people, they would first fire warning shots to disperse them. If the Taiwanese did not attack the military police, they would never open fire in retaliation. However, the number of mainland government personnel and their families who were beaten, injured, or killed has exceeded 400. The American News Agency also claimed: "Taiwanese people requested protection from the US Consulate," which is also not true. It is reported that at 5:00 PM on the 1st, several mainlanders fled into the US Consulate, and the Taiwanese people surrounded the consulate. The US immediately called the Public Security Bureau and requested that the mainlanders be taken back. The Public Security Bureau retrieved them four hours later. The US did not request the Public Security Bureau to send troops to protect the consulate, only stating: "If the Public Security Bureau prevents mainlanders from entering the consulate again, the consulate will not be surrounded by Taiwanese people again."</p>

<h3>Communist Party of China Entrusts China Democratic League to Keep Material in Various Places; Shanghai Office of CPC Announces Closure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Zhou Enlai of Yan'an recently telegraphed Zhang Lan of the China Democratic League, requesting that he keep the materials left by the Communist Party in five cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming. Dong Biwu is currently negotiating with the government. After obtaining the results, he will hand over the goods according to civil law procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has formally announced its closure. Except for Dong Biwu and four others who had previously gone to Nanjing, Chen Jiakang and 28 others (including the staff of the Xinhua Daily in Hankou Road) will leave Shanghai for Beijing this morning and then return to Yan'an. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has added a first-class carriage to the express train leaving for Beijing at 9:00 AM this morning for them. The houses left by the CPC are temporarily being guarded by the Lujiawan Police Sub-bureau.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Whether the representative of the CPC in the UNRRA will retreat at the same time as other CPC personnel has not yet been instructed by the Central Committee. Director Huo was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night, but it has been learned that he will postpone it until tonight. This reporter visited Wu Yunfu yesterday, who said that, according to the principle of relief without discrimination, the representative of the CPC in the UNRRA still hopes to remain in Shanghai, because UNRRA also has two organizations within the CPC areas. However, everything will be decided after Director Huo asks the government for instructions. If he still has to retreat, he will not be able to accompany the CPC personnel who left Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Report on the Shanghai Gold Rush Case by Four Supervisory Committee Members is Released</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Since the gold rush occurred last month, the Control Yuan immediately dispatched Supervisory Committee members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can, as well as auditors Fan Shiyu and Wang Shimin from the Ministry of Audit, to Shanghai for a thorough investigation. They have now returned to Nanjing and prepared a detailed report to the Control Yuan. The original text of the report has been disclosed, as follows: "The committee members were ordered to go to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold case and arrived in Shanghai on February 16th to begin the investigation. Since various relevant agencies in Shanghai were simultaneously responsible for investigating or handling the gold rush after it occurred, including the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Economic Supervision Group, and the investigation personnel sent by the Ministries of Finance and National Defense, although their missions were different, their target was the gold rush case. Therefore, the committee members maintained contact with all parties during the investigation and will report the known information and analysis and judgments based on various investigation materials separately as follows:</p>
<p>First Investigated Item: (A) Investigation of the Central Bank's Gold Trading Situation Since the Central Government decided to implement the policy of buying and selling gold in early March of last year, the Central Bank was responsible for handling it on March 8th. The people actually responsible for the implementation of this task were Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank, Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau, and Yang Anren, the deputy director. The methods of selling gold were divided into two categories: open allocation and secret sale. The open allocation method was based on the Shanghai gold price at 10:00 AM every day by the Central Bank Business Bureau to determine the Central Bank's daily price. According to the number of requests from members of the Gold Industry Association and the Goldsmith Association, the five designated businesses, including Tongfengyu, Taikangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia Changji, and Yang Qinghe Faji, were responsible for purchasing, distributing, and allocating to the member applicants. The secret sale method was that the Central Bank Business Bureau, after the daily open allocation, based on the market situation, at any time based on the highest fluctuating gold market price, sold it in batches through the above-mentioned five businesses to stabilize the gold market price. During the past year, the Central Bank Business Bureau has been found to have the following facts in the execution of the allocation and sale work, which is worth paying attention to: (1) Since the Central Bank implemented the gold trading, the methods and procedures of all work were not formally stipulated in writing, but were decided by Bei, Lin, and Yang of the bank. (2) The original regulations for daily open allocation applications by businesses and firms in the two associations were soon abolished, so that the determination of all open allocation and secret sale prices and the establishment of transactions were only determined by the Central Bank and the five designated firms through telephone conversations. In addition, there were no formal contracts and vouchers for the transactions. (3) The gold stored in the Central Bank was originally in the form of 400-tael gold bricks, but when sold, it was in the unit of bars (10 taels). According to Directors Lin and Yang, the Central Mint did not have complete gold melting equipment, so Tongfengyu was responsible for the distribution. Tongfengyu, Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanyong, Jiuchengyong, Yangqinghe Zhiji, Yufayong, and Xianghe signed contracts with Tongfengyu to decompose the 99 pure gold into gold bars and distribute them to the gold firms and goldsmiths. The Central Bank gave Tongfengyu a smelting loss of 3 fen per 10 taels (see Lin Fengbao's interview transcript and Zhan Liansheng's interrogation transcript). (4) Of the five firms designated by the Central Bank, only Tongfengyu was opened by Zhan Liansheng. The other four firms were reportedly introduced by Zhan Liansheng (see interrogation transcripts of Zhan Liansheng, Fang Jiuxia, Taikangrun, and Yang Qinghe). (5) All five designated firms must have Zhan Liansheng's signature and seal to receive gold bars from the Central Bank (see the same transcript). (6) Before the Central Bank assigned the responsibility for allocation to the designated firms, a total of 65 firms applied to be responsible for the allocation, but only five were designated. Among these five, Tongfengyu did not yet have a business license from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. According to their registration, the capital of Tongfengyu was 15 million yuan, Taikangrun was 2.4 million yuan, Dafengheng was 10 million yuan, Fang Jiuxia Changji was 9.1 million yuan, and Yang Qinghe Faji was 9.6 million yuan, while the registered capital of the gold firms and goldsmiths that applied but were not designated was much larger (see Attachment 7). (7) Since the Central Bank implemented the gold trading last year, there has been a detailed English report to Premier Song every day. Only this year, the Ministry of Finance notified the Central Bank to report the gold sales situation. From January, the Central Bank began to submit a weekly gold trading statistics table. (8) According to the Central Bank's report, except for the gold trading figures from March to November of last year, which are confidential and cannot be fully questioned and reported, the number of gold bars purchased in December was 2,056, and the number sold was 78,306; the number of gold bars purchased in January was 300, and the number sold was 68,454; the number of gold bars purchased in February up to the 15th, when sales were stopped, was 135, and the number sold was 10,986. The income was only from gold mines, so in fact, only gold was sold, and no gold was bought. (9) From January 4th of this year to the date of suspension, the Central Bank entrusted five firms to allocate and sell 79,382 gold bars, with Tongfengyu having the most, accounting for 43,597 bars, followed by Taikangrun, 16,247 bars, Dafengheng, 7,359 bars, Fang Jiuxia Changji, 4,502 bars, and Yang Qinghe Faji, 7,837 bars. Tongfengyu accounted for about 55% of the total sales. (10) According to the number of gold bars allocated and sold by the Central Bank from January 4th to February 15th, there were different numbers listed in the account books of Tongfengyu and the other five firms every day, and the total numbers also differed (see Attachments 8 and 9). (11) The Central Bank suddenly stopped allocating and selling gold on February 10th, causing the gold market price to rise. According to Director Lin and Deputy Director Yang of the bank, the suspension was instructed by Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank. The committee members believe that this incident was a major cause of the gold rush and telegraphed Chairman Chiang about the case on February 20th. [Continued on Page 2]</p>
<h3>Chiang, Concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, Presides Over Routine Meeting; Economic Commission Reorganized Under Executive Yuan; Revised Organic Statute Sent to Legislative Yuan to Complete Legislative Process; Price Control Incorporated into the Commission's Responsibilities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Executive Yuan held its 778th routine meeting at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Chiang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, presided. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, and Qin Dechun reported on national defense. The meeting resolved to approve amendments to the Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council: (1) The name is changed to the National Economic Council; (2) Originally under the National Government, it is now reorganized under the Executive Yuan; (3) The responsibilities of the council are expanded to include "the promotion of specific economic measures," such as the promotion of import management, export promotion, public works, and price controls; (4) The number of ex officio members is increased to include the Director of the Water Conservancy Commission and the Governor of the Central Bank. There will also be 10 to 20 other members. The President arrived at the Executive Yuan at 10:00 AM. After the agenda items were discussed, he gave an impromptu address to the heads of various ministries and commissions, urging them to strengthen administrative efficiency in the future and earnestly implement the emergency economic measures plan. The meeting ended at 11:30 AM, after which he went to the President's office to review official documents, leaving the Executive Yuan at 12:20 PM.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Since its establishment in accordance with the order of the National Government, the Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council has not yet completed the legislative process in the Legislative Yuan. This is because the Legislative Yuan believes that since the Supreme Economic Council is subordinate to the National Government, and the matters under its jurisdiction are similar to those of the Executive Yuan, the matter was delayed for discussion. Recently, the Organic Statute of the Council was amended and approved at the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the 4th, reorganizing it under the Executive Yuan and renaming it the National Economic Council. Its Organic Statute is not significantly different from the previous Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council, with only slight revisions, and it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan immediately to complete the legislative process. Also, at the routine meeting, the Price Control Commission was approved to be subordinate to the National Economic Council. The President of the Executive Yuan serves concurrently as the Chairman of the Commission, and the Vice President of the Executive Yuan serves concurrently as the Vice Chairman. The heads of the ministries and commissions of economics, finance, food, agriculture, and social affairs, the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Mayors of Nanjing and Shanghai serve as members. A routine meeting is held once a week to determine principles, and the implementation is the responsibility of the relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Chairman Orders Earnest Handling of Distribution of Goods to Public Servants</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] President Chiang attaches great importance to the distribution of daily necessities to public school teachers and civil servants. At the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the morning of the 4th, he instructed the responsible personnel to handle the matter earnestly and promptly so that all public school teachers and civil servants can receive tangible benefits.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The supply of daily necessities for the residents of this city has been decided to be handled by the Executive Yuan reviewing the lists, the Bureau of Supplies distributing purchase certificates, the material production agencies supplying materials, and the municipal government contacting and supervising the distribution stores to handle everything separately. However, for the sake of planning and verifying the distribution of goods, a Capital Daily Necessities Distribution Commission will be established to be responsible for handling the matter. The commission will be formed by representatives from the Executive Yuan, the Bureau of Supplies, and the ministries of social affairs, economics, food, and finance. Under it will be established general affairs, verification, food, coal, cloth, oil, sugar, and salt groups. Distribution will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Legislative Members Jian Guansan and Others Suggest Method for Handling Overseas Deposits; Buy 40%, Requisition 40%, and Levy Income Tax; Legislative Yuan Refers to Finance and Economic Committees for Review</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] At the 316th routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 4th, newly appointed legislative members Rui Yifu, Liu Jiaju, Lian Tianxiang, Fu [blank], Guo Chushang, Wang Jun, Fu Wangliang, and Bai Zhaofeng attended for the first time. President Sun presided. Before the meeting began, a brief introduction was given to the new members. Then, routine cases were discussed. Fu Sinian and [blank] Ben [blank] attended on behalf of Academia Sinica to explain the revised Organic Law of Academia Sinica and the draft Statute of the Council of Academia Sinica. It was then passed after discussion. The Organic Law of the Population Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior and the Organic Law of the Water Conservancy Demonstration Project of the Water Conservancy Commission were also passed. In addition, Jian Guansan, Liu Butong, and others proposed a temporary motion, suggesting that the Supreme National Defense Council should buy 40% of the existing deposits of Chinese citizens abroad in the form of ten- or twenty-year public bonds, requisition 40% in the form of donations, and levy a progressive comprehensive income tax on the overseas deposits that have already been withdrawn, based on the original amount of the deposits. The reason is that during the War of Resistance, the overseas deposits of Chinese citizens should have been requisitioned in accordance with the British example. Recently, due to the urgent economic situation and the surge in the use of foreign exchange, the Supreme National Defense Council passed a resolution on February 16 to buy overseas deposits. However, the US government has already unfrozen the deposits, and the depositors have already withdrawn and used them on their own, or used the names of foreign people in order to escape. Therefore, although the government now has a resolution to buy them, the result may not be very fruitful. In order to meet the needs of financial and economic needs, and to remedy this defect, it seems appropriate to buy 40% in the form of public bonds. The current legal exchange rate is 12,000 yuan per US dollar. If foreign deposits are bought with legal tender at this exchange rate, it will inevitably accelerate the deterioration of inflation and expand the flow of floating capital, which will be more harmful than beneficial. It seems appropriate to buy 40% with long-term public bonds of ten or twenty years to delay the burden on the national treasury. At the same time, 40% should be requisitioned in the form of donations. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the government held gold deposits, and then strongly donated 40%. Overseas deposits have no legal basis and are to evade funds. If they are not required to donate 40%, it will inevitably make people feel unfair. At present, US dollar foreign exchange has a fivefold profit in one year. If no order is given for donation, how can the government gain the trust of the people? As for the overseas deposits that have already been withdrawn, a progressive comprehensive income tax should be levied on the original amount. Since the unfrozen deposits are donated and requisitioned, and the depositors who have already withdrawn the deposits are ignored, it is inevitable that one will be treated generously and the other will be treated harshly. Therefore, they should also be made to bear the obligation to pay taxes to the state. Regarding the implementation methods, they advocated that the Executive Yuan draft them and send them to the Legislative Yuan for review, in order to comply with the legislative process and to have a basis for dealing with foreign countries in the future. It was resolved that the case be referred to the Finance and Economic Committees for review.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou News] On the 2nd, the Zhengzheng Street police station of the Second Branch of Hangzhou City cracked a rice hoarding case. The police station received a tip that the warehouse of Daxing Grain Store at No. 49 Fengjiaer was hoarding more than 1,100 dan of rice. They immediately sent capable police officers to investigate and found it to be true. They also found that the store had not registered this batch of wholesale rice with the government. They immediately summoned the manager of the store, Zhang Kunyuan, who is the chairman of the Grain Association. Zhang said that it was recently purchased from Wuxi, so it has not yet been reported to the municipal government. The police station considered it to be related to the people's livelihood and immediately reported it to the branch office for transfer to the general office for instructions.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tragedy in Xiaguan; Strong Winds and Huge Waves Collapse Embankment, Nearly 100 Drown</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The embankment of the third wharf in Xiaguan, which has been in disrepair for many years, was hit by strong winds at 11:40 AM on the 4th and collapsed due to the huge waves, sinking about eight or nine square zhang, causing an unprecedented tragedy in Nanjing.

In addition to comforting the families of the deceased, the authorities are discussing solutions and relief measures.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report; Continued from First Edition Above</h3>
<p>Gold Sales Situation of Gold Shops and Silver Shops</p>
<p>(B) Investigation of the Gold Sales Situation of Gold Shops and Silver Shops. There are two types of gold traders in Shanghai: gold shops, which are engaged in gold trading, and silver shops, which are engaged in the sale of gold ornaments. Silver shops use the sales volume of customers as the standard, and transactions are limited to gold ornaments, so their throughput is smaller. Moreover, silver shops often have a long history and value credit, and their operations are more stable and less likely to engage in risky speculation. Therefore, silver shops have received fewer gold bars from the Central Bank in the past year. Gold shops, on the other hand, specialize in gold speculation and trading. Large customers mostly gather in gold shops, so the fluctuations in the gold market and the determination of gold prices are all controlled by the gold industry. Therefore, in the past year, the amount of gold sold by the Central Bank and purchased by the Gold Industry Association has been far greater than that of the silver shops. In addition to formal gold shops, there are also merchants who specialize in buying and selling on behalf of customers. Most of them have no formal storefronts and have not been registered, but their trading activity is very high, and speculators flock to them, forming a disguised gold exchange, which has a lot of adverse effects on the gold market, and the local authorities have failed to ban it in advance. Even among the 65 firms that applied to undertake the distribution work mentioned above, 44 have not registered and obtained business licenses, and some of the five designated firms have also not obtained business licenses. The daily control is not strict, so speculators can disrupt the financial market and act recklessly, which is a neglect.</p>
<p>Zhan Liansheng Has Controlling Power</p>
<p>As for the situation of the above-mentioned five firms undertaking the distribution of gold from the Central Bank, after the committee members questioned them one by one and investigated all aspects of the situation, the following facts are noteworthy: Although there are five firms in name that undertake the distribution of gold from the Central Bank, in fact, not only Tai Kangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia, and Yang Qinghe are all introduced by Zhan Liansheng, the host of Tongfengyu, but also all the melting of gold bars and the distribution of gold bars by the Central Bank are handled by Tongfengyu and Zhan Liansheng. Therefore, Tongfengyu and Zhan Liansheng not only fully understand the total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank since March 8 last year, but also clearly have complete control over the other four as a whole. It is obvious that a gold shop and merchant engaged in gold speculation can understand the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold sales and control its peers with one hand, creating a gold rush at the appropriate time to take the opportunity to profit.</p>
<p>Central Bank Employees Suspected</p>
<p>The daily gold allocation price of the Central Bank is determined based on the reports of the five companies talking on the phone. Since the five companies are all under the control of Zhan Liansheng, the determination of the gold price is naturally easily manipulated by him. The Central Bank's daily allocation of gold, in addition to the applications of members of the two associations, does not ask how the distribution situation is or how the selling price is after the five companies purchase it in secret, because the Central Bank thinks it is free trading, which inevitably gives people the opportunity to manipulate it. The five firms that undertake the allocation of gold also purchase gold from the market at the same time. In particular, Tongfengyu purchased a large amount of gold before the government announced the suspension of gold sales, which is not only unreasonable but also suspected of manipulating the market after hearing the news. After reviewing the allocation accounts of the five companies, there are many entries for Central Bank employees, including Wang Songwan, the manager in charge of the gold treasury account, who also has gold bar purchase accounts. It is suspicious that the personnel of the Central Bank, which is implementing the gold allocation business, have this trading behavior, using their powers to collude with merchants for profit.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Loans for Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>The Loan Committee for Impoverished Students, initiated and organized by various sectors of this city, was formally established yesterday. Council Speaker Mr. Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as the chairman to oversee all matters. According to Speaker Pan, the committee plans to raise one billion [currency units] for loans. In addition to the five hundred million approved by the municipal government, the remaining five hundred million must be raised through appeals to all sectors of society. Furthermore, as schools at all levels have already started classes, impoverished students urgently need loans. Therefore, before the fundraising is completed, the committee will borrow five hundred million from various banks. It can be said that, broadly speaking, the loan problem for impoverished students this semester has been resolved. However, technically, there are still several issues that need to be discussed.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of loan allocation. Because the total loan amount is limited to one billion, there is an inverse relationship between the number of loan recipients and the amount of the loan they receive. If the number of loan students is set too high, the amount of the loan they receive will be reduced. Given the current environment in Shanghai, where fees at all levels of schools are quite high, a small amount will be of no help. Even if impoverished students receive a loan, their financial problems will not be solved. Conversely, if the loan amount is increased, the number of loan students will inevitably decrease. However, in today's Shanghai, impoverished students are ubiquitous. How to ensure that all impoverished students can receive loans remains a serious problem. Therefore, how to allocate the loans is indeed worthy of careful study by the committee. We have investigated the tuition fees of schools at all levels in Shanghai and will provide a hypothetical allocation for the Loan Committee's reference: set the number of primary school loan students at three thousand, with a loan of one hundred thousand per person; set the number of secondary school loan students at two thousand, with a loan of two hundred thousand per person; and set the number of university and college loan students at one thousand, with a loan of three hundred thousand per person.</p>
<p>The second is the matter of reviewing loan applicants. Students eligible for this loan must simultaneously possess the following two essential conditions: first, their family circumstances must be genuinely impoverished; second, their academic performance and conduct must be truly outstanding. Neither can be lacking. If a student's family is impoverished but their academic performance and conduct are not outstanding, they are not eligible for a loan. This is because the loan is raised from society, and society is only willing to help outstanding students who cannot afford to study. Conversely, if a student's academic performance and conduct are excellent but their family is not impoverished, there is no need for them to request a loan. Allowing them to fraudulently obtain a loan would deprive other impoverished students of their rightful share, which would run counter to the purpose of society's fundraising to help impoverished students. Therefore, all students who wish to apply for a loan must first consider whether they possess these two essential conditions. At the same time, according to Speaker Pan, the application and disbursement procedures for loans will be handled jointly by the Loan Committee and the school authorities. Therefore, we believe that the school authorities should bear more responsibility for the review work.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of fundraising from all sectors of society. "It is most joyful to do good," is something everyone knows. Especially when it comes to helping impoverished students, as long as one's financial ability allows, everyone is willing to contribute generously. Therefore, raising five hundred million for loans from society is not a difficult task in itself. However, the Shanghai market has recently experienced another wave of soaring gold prices, which will inevitably have some impact. Some may even have difficulty taking care of themselves. However, education is the basic work of the nation, especially for those impoverished students, most of whom are outstanding students. In the future, they will all be pillars of the nation and backbones of society. How can we sit idly by and watch these outstanding students drop out of school due to economic difficulties? Therefore, from the standpoint of promoting education and culture, and thinking about the next generation, we must appeal to all sectors of society in Shanghai, requesting that all sectors of society contribute their efforts and money to ensure that the amount the Loan Committee wants to raise can be raised in the shortest possible time. As the saying goes, heaven helps those who help themselves. Helping impoverished students continue their studies is more meaningful and valuable than any other relief effort. It not only directly helps a large number of impoverished students but also indirectly cultivates many useful talents for the country and society. It achieves two goals with one action, so why not do it?</p>
<p>Fourth, schools at all levels have been in session for many days, and how to pay tuition has long made ordinary impoverished students restless. Furthermore, the application procedures for loans have not yet been completed, and the review is not a simple task. Therefore, some people inevitably feel that education loans are like "spring implementing winter orders." This is indeed the case, but we should actively launch loan work, and especially hope that the school authorities at all levels will earnestly assist in completing the initial review work in the shortest possible time, so that ordinary impoverished students can receive loans as soon as possible and no longer suffer from overdue fees.</p>
<p>Finally, we must say a few words to impoverished students with excellent character and academics. It is not a shameful thing for you to receive a loan from society because your family is impoverished and unable to afford your education. In the current environment, the difficulties of the national economy have reached an extreme, and parents' inability to afford their children's tuition has become a widespread phenomenon. In the past, we often heard that a few students, influenced by the vanity of Shanghai society, were ashamed of being impoverished and stubbornly refused to apply to the school. This misconception should be corrected. Therefore, we hope that impoverished students at all levels of schools in this city will actively apply for loans so that the purpose of establishing the Loan Committee for Impoverished Students can be fully realized. As for students who receive loans, they should recognize the current economic difficulties, appreciate the virtue of social relief, cherish the precious time of studying, and work harder and strive for self-improvement to cultivate themselves into talents who are truly useful to the country and society. Only in this way will they not fail the expectations of society for the next generation.</p>

<h3>The Signing Ceremony of the Anglo-French Treaty Was Held in Dunkirk Yesterday; The Crowd Celebrated the Signing Ceremony Warmly</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault signed a 50-year military alliance in Dunkirk at 2:45 PM (Greenwich Mean Time, 10:45 PM Shanghai Time). Ninety percent of Dunkirk was destroyed after the battle. The population is only five thousand, one-sixth of the pre-war population. Bidault left Paris at 9:50 AM this morning (5:50 PM Shanghai Time) and arrived in Dunkirk directly at 2:00 PM. Bevin arrived in Calais at 1:30 PM and then arrived in Dunkirk. After Bevin and Bidault signed the "Dunkirk Agreement," they delivered speeches. The content of the alliance will be announced later. After signing the agreement, Bevin will fly directly to Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and Bidault will fly to Moscow tomorrow after returning to Paris.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Dunkirk, West 4th Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived here at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin also arrived at 2:00 PM, with the crowd cheering along the way to celebrate this signing ceremony.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, 4th Dispatch] The signing ceremony of the Anglo-French alliance will be held in the Dunkirk City Hall. The location is not spacious and can only accommodate 150 people. In addition to Foreign Minister Bidault, the French delegation also includes Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chauvel, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mauvill, and Director of Foreign Economic Affairs Alphand. In addition to Foreign Minister Bevin, the British delegation also includes British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, British Military Attaché to France General Jones, and British Embassy Counselor Sir Pierson Dixon. Foreign Minister Bidault and French Ambassador to Britain Massigli will represent the French government to sign the alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper will represent the British government to sign the alliance treaty. According to news received here today, Foreign Secretary Bevin and his party originally planned to take the destroyer "Bicester" to Calais, but now it has been decided to switch to the ferry "Invicta" because the equipment inside the warship is not suitable.</p>
<p>The Content of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty Does Not Include the Concept of a Western European Group</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] "The Times" recently reported that the Anglo-French alliance does not contain any provisions that would give rise to the concept of a Western European group. Moreover, the provisions of the Anglo-French alliance may be expanded into a four-power pact in the future. The economic cooperation provisions only confirm the situation that already exists between the two countries. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that once the alliance is signed, a copy will be telegraphed to London immediately and submitted to the House of Commons for discussion. The full text of the alliance will not be released until it has been approved by Parliament.</p>
<h3>British and American Foreign Ministers Depart for Moscow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Special Dispatch] The delegation of the United States attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference will be led by Secretary of State Marshall. They will leave here at 9:00 AM on the 5th on four special planes, accompanied by Marshall's assistants and thirty-six American journalists.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 4th Dispatch] After signing the Anglo-French alliance in Dunkirk, British Foreign Secretary Bevin went to the Belgian border to take a special plane to Moscow. Bidault will return to Paris for a while and fly to Moscow on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] On the eve of his departure for Moscow, Foreign Secretary Bevin met with reporters and said: "I feel that we have now reached a stage where people have realized that we must solve world problems and establish a path for future human progress." Bevin said that he was in good health and had high expectations for the Moscow Conference. He said, "I am going there with hope, although it is difficult to predict how things will develop during the conference, I am still as optimistic about the outcome of the conference as I have been in the past."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] Reliable sources said: Foreign Secretary Bevin and Secretary of State Marshall may discuss the Greek issue in Moscow. The British side suggested that if the United States provides economic assistance to Greece, the British army must continue to be stationed in Greece. Bevin and senior officials of the British Foreign Office are considering this point. A British government spokesperson pointed out that the British government's previous statement on Greece had indicated that the number of British troops stationed in Greece would be greatly reduced. London political figures believe that the US government's request for the British government to consider whether it can cancel the decision to withdraw British troops stationed in Greece within three months is indeed a difficult problem for the British government to deal with.</p>
<p>Eight Issues to Seek Resolution</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the China issue, well-informed sources here said that US Secretary of State Marshall will raise this issue for discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed, the Soviet Union agreed not to hinder President Chiang's efforts to establish a united government for the whole country. Now that the United States has announced its withdrawal from China, the British side hopes that the Soviet Union will be able to abide by its promises even more. According to sources close to the British government, Foreign Secretary Bevin will resolve at least eight issues of great importance to world peace during his trip to Moscow, including the China issue. It is expected that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference will last for two months. The eight issues that Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to resolve are: (1) the German issue and the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany; (2) the Austrian issue, and a peace treaty with Austria may be signed in Moscow; (3) the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should conclude a four-power pact to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed; (4) the issue of revising the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin may also hold talks with Stalin to discuss amending the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin will bring a draft with him and hand it over to Stalin as soon as he arrives in Moscow; (5) the Dardanelles Strait issue. The Soviet government has expressed its hope to amend the Montreux Convention. Foreign Secretary Bevin has also notified the Turkish government that the Montreux Convention must be amended by an international conference of the treaty's signatory countries to alleviate Turkey's fears; (6) the Greek issue. This issue will be discussed by Foreign Secretary Bevin and Secretary of State Marshall; (7) the Palestinian issue; (8) the China issue.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Debates the Greek Issue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US House of Representatives began debating today the British's urgent request for the United States to assist in dealing with the Greek issue. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall also attended a meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss the general situation abroad, especially the Greek issue. A Republican congressman told the House that the State Department's foreign policy is firm and realistic, which is enough to prevent Greece from being controlled by the Communist Party ordered by Moscow and to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming a Mediterranean power. I am pleased with this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] At a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee today, Secretary of State Marshall reiterated the British's request for assistance to Greece. This matter may cause the most intense debate on post-war foreign policy. The detailed content of Marshall's proposal is unknown, but it is known that Marshall urged the committee to approve American loans to prevent the establishment of a communist regime in Greece.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Athens, 3rd Associated Press Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the Greek government has instructed its ambassadors in Washington and London to express their agreement to the Anglo-American agreement on the future of Greece.</p>
<p>Guerrillas in Northern Greece</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 3rd Dispatch] Greek officials said: The Greek military authorities have evidence that since the United Nations investigation team arrived in Greece a month ago, the guerrillas in northern Greece have still received weapons from the air, which are supplied by Greece's northern neighbors.</p>
<p>Hurley's Remarks</p>
<p>[United Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 3rd Dispatch] Former US Ambassador to China General Hurley told reporters today: "One of the two things, the US withdrawal from China and the entry into Greece, must be a mistake. The reason why he resigned as ambassador to China was because the United States was entering a strong power policy of colonial imperialism, which was the opposite of Soviet imperialism. The US decision to aid Greece is proof of this."</p>
<h3>British Cuts in Military Spending</h3>
<p>More Than Half of the Army Personnel to Be Reduced</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] The Ministry of the Army recently submitted the budget for the fiscal year 1947-1948, which greatly reduces military spending and the number of troops.

<h3>The Korean Provisional Government May Be Established Within Days; Syngman Rhee as Head, Kim Koo as Deputy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 4th Dispatch] According to reliable sources: the Korean "Provisional Government" headed by Syngman Rhee and Kim Koo as deputy can be announced within 48 hours.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, who was exiled in Chongqing during the war, has reached an understanding with Syngman Rhee and the Democratic Party to form this Korean independent government. The public announcement can be made after Kim Koo and the Democratic Party's seats in the cabinet are arranged.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union Should Abide by Their Promises to Complete the Unification of Korea</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: US Republican Representative Shafer made a speech in the House of Representatives, stating that the Soviet Union is now treating Korea in the same way as it treated Poland, making it another puppet state of the Communist Party. The British Commonwealth has established a puppet communist regime in its occupied area, claiming that it allows Koreans to exercise autonomy, while using various methods to turn Koreans in the area into communists. In December 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement in Moscow to reunite Korea and establish a unified provisional government for the whole country, but this resolution has not been implemented due to the Soviet Union's obstruction.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Kim Yang-yong, chairman of the Korean Political Affairs Association, recently delivered a broadcast speech, suggesting that the United States and the Soviet Union should formally or informally discuss the Korean issue at the Moscow Conference. The main points of his proposal are as follows: (1) The "unnatural" demarcation line of the 38th parallel in Korea should be removed. (2) Koreans should establish a provisional government without interference from the United States and the Soviet Union. (3) US and Soviet troops should withdraw from Korea at the same time. (4) The provisional government may appoint foreign advisors and technicians to assist in building the national economy. (5) The United States and the Soviet Union should guarantee Korea's sovereignty and not seek political and economic privileges in Korea.</p>
<h3>Stalin Resigns from Military Post; Bulganin Succeeds as Minister of Defense</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch] Moscow Radio recently broadcast the news that Marshal Stalin has resigned from his concurrent post as Minister of Defense due to the burden of other duties. He will be succeeded by General Bulganin, Deputy Minister of the Military and Political Affairs. General Bulganin was born in 1895. He served as the manager of an electrical machinery manufacturing plant. During the war, he served as the political commissar of Marshal Zhukov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army. In 1944, he was appointed Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He was soon promoted to general and succeeded Marshal Voroshilov as Deputy Minister of Defense. He was then transferred to the post of Deputy Minister of the Military and Political Affairs until now.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd Dispatch] Unofficial Soviet sources here believe that Stalin's resignation from military posts at the age of sixty-seven does not have any special significance. The reason for his resignation is that his duties are too heavy to bear, which is indeed the case. As the Soviet Union recently focused on increasing industrial production and accelerating the implementation of the current five-year plan, his resignation from concurrent posts is related to this. Stalin still retains the posts of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and Chairman of the Control Commission. Bulganin once served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, which is actually the Deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. During the war, he was transferred to important military posts and was recognized as a talent in diplomacy and administration, not just a great soldier. When he served as Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet during the war, he was able to give full play to his talents.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Status: The British Government Will Issue a Statement</h3>

<h3>It Is Rumored That Stalin Would Agree to the Tanaka Memorial; Tanaka Revealed It in the Far East Court</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] Japan's wartime parliament speaker Tadahiko Okada revealed in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal today that Stalin had agreed to the plan to establish an autonomous government in Asia in the 1926 "Tanaka Memorial," but he also admitted that there were no documents to prove it. The memorial planned to maintain peace in Asia and to link Korea, Manchuria, and the southern region of Lake Baikal in Siberia into a buffer neutral zone. Stalin had expressed his agreement, and China was also very likely to agree. However, there was widespread opposition in Japan because "some Japanese people did not want Korea to become a part of the autonomous region." The plan was eventually scrapped due to the death of Zhang Zuolin in a car accident, which led to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Okada also said: "Because Stalin expressed his agreement in a secret meeting, there were no documents."</p>
<h3>Truman Arrives Safely in Mexico City; Delivers a Speech Emphasizing the Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 3rd Dispatch] US President Truman arrived here today by plane from Kansas City for a three-day goodwill visit. Mexican President Alemán and senior government officials warmly welcomed him at the airport and fired a 21-gun salute. As Truman drove to the US Embassy, the two-mile-long route was decorated with the flags of both the United States and Mexico, and tens of thousands of farmers and workers cheered along the way with their families. Upon arrival at the US Embassy, welcoming crowds scattered flowers along the way. Mexican President Alemán then hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace. At the end of the banquet, Truman delivered a speech to the crowd. The cheers of the audience rose and fell like thunder. Truman said: "The United States is determined to fulfill its promise to help small and weak countries around the world deal with oppression. This voice of the United States can be heard everywhere in the world, and it is clearer and more powerful than before." Truman then elaborated on the doctrine of non-interference, guaranteeing that the United States would be faithful to the doctrine of non-interference in both words and spirit, but this does not mean that it is unconcerned about the situation in other countries. Truman said: "The major events of one country may have a profound impact on other countries. If any member of a group of countries violates the recognized principles of conduct, the whole group must feel concerned. The doctrine of non-interference means that strong countries have no right to use their power to force weak countries to accept their own will. We wholeheartedly accept this doctrine as the cornerstone of the entire American system. Without it, we cannot be good neighbors. This is the obligation stipulated by the Good Neighbor Policy and is a part of the basic international law common to all American countries. The pursuit of collective security in the world has been carried out simultaneously with the gradual recognition of the doctrine of non-interference. We have made encouraging progress in building a group of countries to deal with violating countries by law. The Charter of the United Nations is a prominent example." Truman also expressed the friendship and trust of the American people to the Mexican people, and finally said: "Although the road to friendship with neighboring countries and even the whole world is long and tiring, we should complete it. The United States and Mexico must not let each other down."</p>

<h3>The Assertion That North Korea is Conscripting Soldiers is an Untrue Soviet Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] Moscow Radio announced today that the so-called statement by Hodge, the US military commander in southern Korea, that the Soviet Union is conscripting 500,000 soldiers in northern Korea is completely unfounded and purely fictitious.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The US Senate today passed a resolution by a vote of 64 to 24, stipulating that the US federal government budget should be $33 billion, which is $4.5 billion less than the amount specified in the budget proposal submitted to Congress by President Truman.

<p>Republican Congressmen Discuss Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The House of Representatives today debated the foreign policy and budget bills. Republican Congressman Herbertson stated: "If it is said that our country's 60 million producers can bear the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the world, this is a mathematical error." While we can supply considerable food and medicine to alleviate famine and suffering, the economic fallacy assumes that we can revive the world. Republican Congressman Meyer mentioned Greece, believing that the country is the last remaining hope of democracy in the Balkans. However, Republican Congressman Hoffman warned that the United States should pay more attention to domestic affairs before American youth can be sent abroad to resolve disputes in Greece, the Balkans, and Iraq. Republican Congressman Buffett stated that future loans to Greece raise the question of whether the United States will continue to be played by Stalin in economic terms. For several years, the United States has poured tens of thousands of British pounds into China, France, and Yugoslavia, but who can say that these countries are further away from communism than they were two years ago?</p>
<h3>US Conscription Law to be Abolished at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Truman Advocates No Further Extension</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman today proposed to Congress that the conscription law be allowed to expire at the end of the month. The President's message stated that the purpose of the conscription's termination is to reduce the army to 1.7 million men by July 1. However, if the army and navy are unable to recruit the legal number of soldiers through voluntary recruitment methods in the future, they may request the restoration of the conscription law. At the same time, the Department of the Army announced that commanders at home and abroad have been ordered to discharge 100,000 conscripts before the end of June this year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] President Truman has sent a message to Congress requesting that the conscription law not be extended, but according to well-informed sources, this does not mean that the US government will abandon its compulsory military service system. It is expected that Truman will submit a compulsory military service bill to Congress in late March or early April.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Army Advocates Compulsory Military Service</p>
<p>US Secretary of the Army Patterson recently stated that if a major war breaks out in the future and the United States is attacked by an enemy, there will be no time to prepare. Such an attack will not only be sudden but also extremely fierce. The only way for the United States to ensure a sufficient number of trained soldiers is to implement compulsory military service.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Palestine is Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>Jewish Terrorist Groups Attack British Army Camps</p>

Prior to this, Jewish terrorist groups announced that open war had broken out in Palestine. Jewish attacks on British army camps in the Teuk-vah and Huttera areas were quite successful. These Jewish actions are in retaliation for the British army's declaration of martial law in Jewish areas of Palestine.

Both Jews and Britons acknowledge that indefinite military administration will bankrupt the economies of the affected areas.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 3rd] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi said today that Egypt has decided to submit the issue of Anglo-Egyptian treaty relations to the United Nations Security Council. The breakdown of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations was due to the failure to meet two points unanimously demanded by the Egyptian people. These two points are the immediate and complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the annexation of Sudan to Egypt, including the establishment of an autonomous government in Sudan and the restoration of Egyptian administrative power in Sudan to promote Sudanese autonomy.</p>

<p>According to an auditor of the Central Bank who went to investigate and arrest the suspects the day before yesterday, the US dollar transactions on the day of the arrest, found in the account books, amounted to 400 million yuan in national currency. However, the personnel of Abis Co. denied buying and selling gold and currency after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures, and claimed that it was not illegal to possess gold and currency. As for the rumor that the New Company and Abis Co. are joint companies and are related to this case, the company, which is engaged in the stock business, continued to operate yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Head Butler of the British Consul General's Residence Slacks Off</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Li Qingbo, who serves as the head butler in the private residence of Auckland, the British Consul General in Shanghai. This time, the cost of living index was frozen, and a differential subsidy system was implemented for the February wages. After an additional 73,000 yuan was issued, other Chinese employees of the Consul General's Office were paid in this way, but Li Qingbo was forgotten. Dissatisfied, Li implemented a "slowdown" by not providing meals on the 3rd. Auckland was furious and claimed that he had never encountered such a thing in his 35 years in China and would definitely fire Li. Li then requested that he be paid three months' severance pay in accordance with the dismissal procedure. After arguing indecisively, he called the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to send someone to mediate. After some explanation, Li wrote a letter of repentance to express his apology for his improper attitude, and the 73,000 yuan difference was paid as usual. A storm subsided. This is also an interesting little episode in labor disputes.</p>

<h3>YMCA Fundraising Conference: Celebrities Attend the Opening Ceremony; Mayor Wu's Wonderful Analogy of the "Taiji Diagram"; Speaker Pan Elaborates on "Serving Others"</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The 47th fundraising conference of the YMCA in this city was held at the Shanghai Sports Association on Maoming South Road, formerly the French General Association, at 12:00 noon yesterday. Mayor Wu served as the general captain of the fundraising campaign, and more than 500 celebrities from all walks of life participated. The conference was presided over by Dr. Gu Huiqing. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Kong Xiangxi, Ren Zhi, and Chen Ganchen, the general secretary of the association, gave speeches. There were also entertainment programs such as a solo by Xu Aijuan and a piano performance by Zeng Huixi. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and it did not end until 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Wu used the Taoist Taiji diagram as an analogy for today's society. He said: The Taiji diagram has two colors, black and white, which are symbols of darkness and light, and also indicate that there are two forces of good and evil in society. If the evil forces prevail, the world will be in great chaos. Therefore, everyone should have the determination to fight against the evil forces. In this era, to dispel darkness, we must improve people's hearts and support the good forces in society. The YMCA is a good force in today's society, so we must do our best to support it and make it thrive, so as to promote society to the path of truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan said: Unity is strength in everything. Anything can be achieved if many people work together. On the contrary, if it only relies on the strength of a few people, even small things are difficult to succeed. Today, the YMCA has begun fundraising, and so many people have participated, so the result can be predicted. The purpose of the YMCA is "not to be served, but to serve." Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, social morality in our country has declined drastically. The only way to save it is to benefit the people with the spirit of "serving others." One of the twelve rules of the Kuomintang states that "helping others is the source of happiness." The true happiness in the world lies in sharing happiness with others. The YMCA has always been service-oriented, and we must cherish it. We deeply hope that this fundraising can be successful quickly, so that the YMCA's achievements can be promoted.</p>

<h3>The Qingpu Fifteen-Life Case Concludes: Witnesses, from Children to the Elderly, Appear in Court Kneeling and Begging for Justice; The Two Defendants Claim That Those Killed Were All Robbers</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Zou Baoxian, the head of the Xi'an Township in the pseudo-Qingpu County, and others brutally murdering fifteen people from northern Jiangsu Province concluded in the High Court yesterday morning. The sentencing is scheduled for the morning of the 11th.</p>
<p>The case occurred on February 28, 34th year of the Republic. The plaintiffs, Gu Nianlin and others, sailed in small boats and anchored near the old Zhaihe River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township. Because it was the beginning of the lunar new year and there was no work to do, Gu's eldest daughter, Huang Gu's, eldest son-in-law, Huang Kaishan, second son-in-law, Zhou Zhenghong, and Cui Xiaogouzi, Ji Kejun, Ji Deng's, Liu Shizizi, Liu Xiaowuzi, Meng Er, Gu Changguan, Ji Bubi, Zhou Liu and his wife, Liu Jinzhi, and Liu Xiaoerzi, sixteen people in total, went ashore to pick grass for fuel.</p>
<p>At that time, Cui Xiaogouzi removed the bamboo fence of the villagers of Xiaoyin Township, and had a quarrel with Yang Ada, Chen Amu, and others. They then beat Xiaogouzi and others. Zhou Liu refused to accept this and argued with them. Yang Ada, Chen Amu, and others abandoned Cui Xiaogouzi and beat Zhou Liu, who was injured and died on the spot. Yang Ada and others knew that they had caused trouble, and reported to the township head Zou Baoxian. At the same time, Baozhang Xue Shunde beat the gong to gather a crowd of thirty to forty people, armed with shoulder poles and rakes, who surrounded and beat the victims. Except for Zhou Liu, who had already died, and Liu Xiaoerzi, who took the opportunity to escape, the remaining fourteen people were tied up. At night, Zou Baoxian, Yu Kesheng (township head of Xiaoyin Township), Xue Shunde (Baozhang of Xi'an Township), Yang Ada, Chen Kemu, and others discussed and inhumanely murdered all fourteen members of the Huang Gu family, including men, women, the old, and the young, to silence them. The case has been filed by the High Prosecutor's Office as a public prosecution for murder by traitors, and the High Court has opened trials to investigate. Zou Baoxian and Chen Amu were brought to trial yesterday morning, while Yu Kesheng, Xue Shunde, and Yang Ada are all at large. Zou stood in the defendant's dock, wearing a dark gray old silk-faced cotton robe, with a dejected look. Chen Amu stood to Zou's right. The victim's family, Gu Nianlin and others, more than ten people in total, sat in the audience. They were all old, weak, women, and children, wearing tattered clothes and looking haggard. Among them was a little girl of five or six years old, with white threads tied in her braids, who seemed to be an orphan of the victims.</p>
<p>Zou Baoxian confessed: The fifteen-life case did happen, but they were bandits, and the incident occurred in Xiaoyin Township. Chen Amu confessed: They were robbers who tied me up from my bed. President Xiao rebuked: You have confessed that you have no property and are working for others. What is the use of bandits binding you? Chen was speechless. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Gu Nianlin, was called to testify. Gu said: He is sixty-one years old and from Funing. He described the experience of being killed in detail. When he spoke of the sad part, he suddenly trembled all over, knelt down with a plop, burst into tears, unable to speak, and kept shouting "Justice, sir!" The court officials hurriedly invited three doctors and nurses from the prison hospital to take care of him. After the prosecutor requested that he be punished according to law, the lawyer appointed by the court, Lu Zongzhao, stood up to defend the defendant. The court ruled that the case would be sentenced on the morning of the 11th. The defendant's request to meet with his family was denied, and he was still escorted back to Zhongjian Prison.</p>

<h3>Li Qingping in Prison: Unable to Spend the Spring; Confined Behind Iron Bars, Her Beauty Becomes More Gaunt</h3>
<p>Li Qingping, a young female painter, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of being a traitor last summer after holding an art exhibition in Shanghai. She was interrogated once, but the date of her retrial has not yet been set. During Qingping's initial trial, she used her eloquent tongue to offer various ingenious defenses to the judge, stating, "My life is dedicated to art; if one has art, why be a traitor?" To understand her life behind bars, a reporter specifically visited the Tilanqiao Women's Prison to inquire. With the permission of the prison section chief, we were led on a tour by Director Zhuang of the Supervisory Section. Female traitors are housed on the second floor, several sharing a room. The floors of the rooms are extremely clean, and each room is equipped with a bed and a flush toilet. Because the female traitors are awaiting trial, they are forbidden from receiving visitors according to orders from above, so the reporter could only stand outside the main railing and look inside. Through the small window, Li Qingping was seen wearing a light blue Western-style suit, her face even more gaunt than during the trial. According to the reporter's inquiries, they are not allowed to read newspapers or bring in books, and of course, they have no way to paint for recreation. Li Qingping's life consists of waking up early and going to bed late, doing morning exercises on the rooftop terrace, and talking with the other female traitors to pass the day.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Bloodshed Incident in Zhongshan Park: Military Police Investigator Tricked and Stabbed; Anle Factory Employee Arrested; Complex Details</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Changning Road Branch Bureau learned late the day before yesterday that a bloody incident had occurred in Zhongshan Park and that the injured person had been sent to Renai Hospital. After investigation, it was learned that the injured person, named Wang Yujiong, was a lieutenant investigator of the Military Police. Last summer, a labor dispute occurred at the Anle Woolen Mill on Changning Road, and he went to mediate, so he was familiar with both labor and management. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, someone suddenly called Wang in the name of Deng Zhongyuan, the manager of the factory, and arranged to meet at the Rongkang Restaurant in Jing'an Temple at 7:00 PM. Upon arrival, he met a Zhang Yinqing, who claimed to be Deng's representative. Zhang told Wang that Deng's son had recently been kidnapped, and Deng wanted to trouble Wang to represent him in contacting the kidnappers, who had scheduled negotiations tonight on the lawn of St. John's University. After tea for more than ten minutes, they took a rickshaw to the university, where they stayed for two hours without seeing anyone. They then walked to Zhongshan Park for a rest. Zhang suddenly took Wang by surprise, pulled out a dagger, and stabbed him in the back of the head. As Wang attempted to draw his gun to retaliate, Zhang struck a second time, injuring a wrist and causing Wang to drop his firearm. The pistol was activated during the fall, however no injuries occurred. Wang fled to the toilet and was later escorted to the hospital by the patrolling police. Section Chief Shi and others went to the Anle Factory and other places late at night to investigate and apprehend the culprit but were unsuccessful. At around 6:00 AM, Zhang happened to pass by the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Changning Road and was finally arrested by the officers involved. A light blue cloth mask, a bunch of keys, a dagger, and a pistol (taken from Wang), and two rows of bullets were found on his person. He was taken to the bureau for questioning. He confessed to being 20 years old, from Jiangyin, and a trainee at the Anle Factory, but was actually a foreman. He confessed to stabbing Wang. It is reported that the contents of the case are complex and are still under investigation.</p>

<h3>Xiang Sheng Taxi Driver Sacrificed During the War; Father Seeks Compensation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Haoyou, a driver for Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, was requisitioned by the government during the outbreak of the War of Resistance (requisitioning vehicles, not people). On the company's orders, he accompanied the vehicle to protect it and unfortunately sacrificed his life. After the victory, his elderly father, Wang Xinggui, requested compensation from Zhou Xiangsheng, the general manager of Xiang Sheng Company. Although Zhou agreed, he did not fulfill his promise.

<h3>Public Bus Ticket Inspection: Inspector Assaulted; Dispute over Fare; Temporary Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Lin Houqi, a prosecutor from the city's High Procuratorate, Ye Yushao, and clerk Chen Ruxian, left their residence on North Sichuan Road at 8:30 AM yesterday morning and boarded the No. 9 public bus of the Municipal Public Works Bureau at the New World to go to the High Procuratorate in Chuyuan, West Jianguo Road, for work. After boarding, they bought 300 yuan bus tickets from the conductor. On the way, Dong Hao, ticket inspector No. 31 of the company, found that Prosecutor Ye's ticket had expired, and a conflict arose over paying for a supplementary ticket. The ticket inspector assaulted Inspector Lin and prevented the two prosecutors from getting off the bus. Fortunately, judicial police arrived, rescued the two inspectors, and detained Dong Hao for interrogation at the local procuratorate. Upon learning of the incident, the Public Works Bureau immediately sent Commissioner Ding to release him. According to reporter's investigation, although this case was purely a misunderstanding, the attitude of service personnel on public vehicles towards passengers really needs to be improved. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Shen Zushou, after finishing work in the afternoon, made a point of not taking the special car prepared by the Procuratorate, but instead "rode the tram" with the reporter, secretly observing the attitude of the ticket seller, etc., with the intention of "on-the-spot investigation".</p>

<h3>Young Woman Unhappily Falls into Prostitution; Deeply Repents and Asks Legal Experts to Open a Path to Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am a poor, pitiful girl, 17 years old. Unfortunately, I lost my father, and my home is desperately impoverished. My father's burial was difficult, and I thought and thought but could not find a solution. My kind mother, unable to bear it any longer, actually sold me for 1 million yuan to another person to pay for my father's burial for a term of two years. Now, the person holding me is forcing me into prostitution, causing my body and soul to suffer all the pain in the world. I am weak and helpless, and there is no one to turn to. I am truly at the end of my rope, trapped in despair. In this time of loudly proclaiming "democracy," such a heinous act is harmful to social morals and human ethics. Your newspaper has always provided a service to society and is a mouthpiece for the people. It will certainly be able to grant a corner of its pages to expose this situation, to uphold justice, and to help me find a "lighthouse" in the vast ocean. I would be deeply grateful! I humbly present a few points, please enlighten me as follows: (1) Will the person holding me be subject to legal sanctions for forcing me into prostitution? (2) I have been a prostitute for nearly a year, and the 1 million yuan deposit has long been exceeded, but I have no way to save up money to redeem myself. Do I have the right to leave? (3) Can I publish a statement in the newspaper declaring my withdrawal from prostitution? Can I get legal support? Yours sincerely, Junli from Suzhou, February 10, Changshu.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) The person holding you is guilty of a crime against public morals under the criminal law. (2) Using a person as collateral is illegal, so there is no need to mention the issue of redemption money when leaving. (3) Publishing a statement in the newspaper is of no help. It is best to seek assistance from the Women's Association or the police station.</p>

<h3>Chinese Artist's Woodcut Exhibition in London</h3>
<p>[British Information Office, London, 3rd] The Contemporary Chinese Woodcut Exhibition, initiated by the Chinese Ministry of Information, opened at the China Society here today and is scheduled to last for three weeks. The exhibits are wartime woodcuts collected by the Chinese Woodcut Artists Association. The purpose of the exhibition is to "allow British art colleagues to learn how China used woodcuts during the war and how Chinese woodcut artists continued to engage in art despite the harsh environment." The woodcuts are the works of more than 40 artists, most of whom are not professional woodcut artists. In fact, some are painters, some are sculptors, and some use woodcuts as a pastime. Since the artists are not professional experts and lack the necessary tools and equipment during the war, their work is extremely difficult, which makes this exhibition even more colorful. There are no fewer than 118 woodcuts on display, including 20 by Wang Zhi (transliteration below), 13 by Lu Tian, and 7 by Ci Ziwen. The themes and styles are different, proving that Chinese woodcut artists have reached a very high standard. At the same time, various aspects of Chinese life and its people are vividly presented in the woodcuts. The visitors who came to the exhibition were moved by the high style and realism of the works.</p>

<h3>Sealand Blue Frenziedly Invades, Giants Fight Valiantly and Lose; Chinese United Five Tigers Defeat Railway Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the Second Basketball League, there were three matches last night. In the women's division, the Women's Youth Purple team defeated the Power team with a score of 44 to 17, which was no longer related to the overall situation. In the men's Division 1, the Sealand Blue team defeated the Giants. The Foreign Legion fought among themselves. The Giants were greatly affected because the star player Pi Gaonai did not come and Gu Fo was absent in the first half. The result was 53 to 48. In the final match, the Chinese United team defeated the Railway Beijing team with a score of 64 to 39. The battle of the Foreign Legion was the most exciting of the three matches, and more than 500 spectators were extremely excited.</p>
<p>Women's Youth Purple Defeats Power Team</p>
<p>Qian Chuping of the Women's Youth Purple team opened the scoring, and Zhu Jinjin made a free throw. Gu Liqian of the Power team scored five points, surpassing them to make the score 3 to 5. Then Chu Ping Wu and Hua Wu of the Women's Youth Purple team each scored a goal, and the first quarter ended with a score of 11 to 5, with the Women's Youth Purple team winning. In the second quarter, the three players scored another eleven points, and the Power team was stuck without any points, making the score 22 to 5. The third quarter was still tense, and the score was 34 to 9. At the end of the fourth quarter, the Women's Youth Purple team defeated the Power team with a score of 44 to 17.</p>
<p>Sealand Blue Defeats Giants</p>
<p>In the battle between the Giants and the Sealand Blue team, the Giants seemed to lose their souls due to the absence of Gu Fo and Pi Gaonai. Kaijie Milov also put on his uniform and came on the court, but it was still difficult to resist the frenzied attack of the Sealand Blue team. When Hailu Haiflu and Peter Jones scored 13 points, the Giants only scored 3 points. Funik scored three goals and made two free throws, but the difference was still wide. In the first half, the Sealand Blue team had a significant advantage with a score of 27 to 15.</p>
<p>In the second half, Gu Fo arrived and Qiang Dulai replaced N Sasha Sijin, intending to reorganize their forces and revive themselves. After Funik and Gu Fo each scored two goals, the score gradually approached (32 to 23). Tao Bolingji was good at operating, and when the score was 35 to 27, the difference was only 8 points. The Giants called a timeout, wanting to make a move. Funik carried the ball inside and scored, and Qiang She Lai followed, making the score 37 to 31, a difference of 6 points. At this time, the two armies fought hand-to-hand, and the movements resembled wrestling. Peter Men of the Sealand Blue team was the pillar of the whole team, commanding the battle, and calmly coping with the tense situation. The report said that in the last four minutes, the score was 48 to 41. At one minute and 30 seconds, it was 53 to 46. Fulu was called for a foul and graduated, and was replaced by Boss. In the last three seconds, Bo also got sick. Four people fought to the end, and the result was 53 to 48. It was quite difficult for Sealand Blue to win.</p>
<p>Chinese United Defeats Railway Beijing</p>
<p>The Chinese United team competed against the Railway Beijing team in the third match. Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, and Bao Songyuan of the Chinese United team competed for shots, and Gao County scored eight points. Yang Xian of the Railway Beijing team broke the record. In the first half, the score was 31 to 14. Seeing that there was a lack of stimulation, most of the fans withdrew.</p>
<p>When the sides changed again, Zhang Liangxiong of the Chinese United team replaced Chen Xuechong. Last night, Li Zhenzhong sat under the scoring board in plain clothes as an observer. When the score was 37 to 20, Xue Chong replaced Songyuan. After that, Jiang Guoping and Sheng Dongyu of the Railway Beijing team scored enough points to compete with the Chinese United team, but the Chinese United team was deeply rooted and still defeated the Railway Beijing team with a score of 64 to 39.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team to Visit Southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team was organized and established by Mr. Qu Yaokang last year, it has successively competed against the leading Chinese and Western teams in the city and won all the matches with brilliant results. The team originally planned to go to the United States, but due to various problems, it could not be resolved, so it was shelved. Recently, the Shanghai Star Team decided to go to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou first. This matter has been negotiated and arranged by the team leader, Mr. Qu Yaokang. Team leader Qu was originally scheduled to take a China Airlines flight to Hong Kong first yesterday, but temporarily changed the flight due to the inferior climate in Hong Kong, and left Shanghai on a flight at 9:30 AM this morning.</p>
<p>At 3:25 PM yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu Guozhen inquired about the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team's visit to the United States and Southern China, and summoned Qu Yaokang to the Municipal Government for a face-to-face consultation. Mayor Wu was very concerned about the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team's visit. In order to facilitate the team, the Foreign Affairs Office specially prepared letters of certification and sent them to the governors of Hong Kong and Macau and the mayor of Guangzhou. As for the passport issue for the visit to the United States, it was promised that after the visit to Hong Kong was completed, a request would be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for the passport. The Mayor also gave encouragement to the team's trip. The meeting ended at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>In addition to team leader Qu leaving first this morning, the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team will depart by China Airlines flight in mid-month. The full list is recorded below:</p>
<p>Qu Yaokang (Team Leader), Xi Chuanming (Executive), Lu Hanjun (Captain), Wang Youxin, Wang Changhou, Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, Huang Zhijun.</p>

<h3>Notes by the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>When the two Foreign Legion strong teams met in the Basketball League, only 60% of the seats in the Municipal Gymnasium were occupied last night, which can be said to be unexpected. Basketball fans who know the sport should not miss this great battle.</p>
<p>At the start of the match, the Giants could not prevent Fulak, the center of the Sealand Blue team, from grabbing the ball under the basket because Gu Fo was absent, causing Fulak and Blok to take things as if they were taking things out of a bag, and the score created a situation of ten to one, nineteen to three, and even twenty-six to eight.</p>
<p>After thirteen to three, the Generals of the Giants fell into panic, and frequently made futile long-range shots. Tao Bolingji's mid-range shooting was nineteen off. At this time, the Giants completely collapsed, only being beaten and not being able to talk about defensive tactics.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Sealand Blue team led by as many as twelve points. At the beginning of the second half, Gu Fo arrived, and the Giants had one more tall player, gaining an advantage in ball possession. Funik was dedicated to guarding Fulak at this basket, and the difference between the two was only two inches. Gu Fo was responsible for initiating the counterattack, and Funik and Gu Fo each scored, and the score was forced to 30 to 15, and then to 30 to 21. When the score was 35 to 25, Tao Boling and Funik each scored a goal, and the Giants were only six points behind. There were still nine minutes left, which was the only good opportunity to reverse the situation in yesterday's match, but the Giants were unable to control and utilize it.</p>
<p>When the score was forced to 53 to 46, Fulak was fouled and left the court, and there was only one minute left. Before long, Blok was also penalized, and the Giants only added two points by Kayno Milov to complete the match.</p>
<p>If Gu Fo had been on the court all the time, the situation would have changed and it would have been difficult to predict. Since the Giants have been defeated again and again, the championship will become a situation where the Chinese United, Sealand Blue, and Shantou teams compete against each other. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>Stock Exchange Requests Police Bureau to Withdraw Monitoring Post; Hua Stocks Experience a Surge in Trading; Market Prices Repeatedly Rise, with Many Stocks Reaching Their Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both bulls and bears on the Hua stock market proceeded cautiously. Besides some mutual liquidation, there was no unusual activity. The market was generally stable during the morning session. In the afternoon, news spread that the police bureau had withdrawn its monitoring personnel, and buying interest gradually increased, suddenly displaying unusual brilliance.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw a slight increase.

<h3>Government Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>Government bonds were generally stable yesterday. Although the police bureau intervened midway, it did not have much impact. Continued Bond C opened low at 7600 yuan, with a low price of 7400 yuan and a high price of 8100 yuan. It finally hovered around 8000 yuan. Major investors in rooms 552, 503, and 360 were buying, while rooms 54, 614, and 604 were selling. The transaction volume was about 4 million yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, all bonds fell by 200-300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rubber Stocks Continue to Perform Well</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were weak in the morning but firm in the afternoon, purely influenced by the environment, resulting in a rebound. The demand for rubber stocks exceeded supply and has not decreased slightly. Asking prices have continued to rise. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yip Kwong fell weakly by half a percent, British Union Aviation rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. Rubber stocks rose slightly again.</p>
<h3>The Silverware Industry Quietly Awaits Its Fate; Some Are Temporarily Dealing in Refined Silver</h3>
<p>The national silverware industry's joint petition delegation returned to Shanghai from Beijing and held a congress of representatives from various regions in Shanghai. As a result of the discussion, all the representatives from various regions, except for one person from each region who remained in Shanghai for liaison purposes, returned to their respective places to report the proceedings. However, although the authorities sympathized with the current situation of the silverware industry as a result of this petition, they were particularly considering ways to make accommodations. However, the industry has been closed for a long time, and the expenses such as staff salaries are huge, so the losses are quite large. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly decide on improvement measures. It is learned that some of the smaller silverware shops in Shanghai have declared liquidation due to their inability to maintain operations. There are also some small silverware shops that have temporarily engaged in buying and selling refined silver and setting gems for customers in order to maintain their current livelihood. According to people in the industry, if the authorities still do not announce a solution in the short term, it is feared that a small number of silverware shops will be forced to liquidate.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry's Premium Income Can Reach 10 Billion Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Lo Pak-chen, chairman of the National Federation of Insurance Business Associations, his estimates are that the monthly premium income of the national insurance industry has now reached the target of 10 billion yuan. Currently, the insurance industry is planning to initiate the organization of a general insurance group in order to seek to absorb premiums, diversify risks, and avoid the outflow of profits. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has recently improved its tax collection methods for the insurance industry. For example, business tax is now collected according to the amount of capital, and stamp tax is changed to a tiered fixed tax rate. In addition, the China Trust Bureau's price index insurance advocated by Mr. Lo had a total premium income of more than 45 billion yuan last month. Because the cost of living index has been frozen, the index on which the bureau is based has also been frozen. However, he is currently considering how to make appropriate adjustments based on the monthly price differences announced by the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui Colourless "Taipan" Brand Officially Sells the First Batch</h3>
<p>The "Ping Shui" Colourless "Taipan" brand tea, which is sold to the Americas, has been frequently inquired about by the Shanghai Tea Company in this city regarding the new tea from the 35th year. At present, a batch of about several hundred boxes has been officially sold, with a price of 450,000 yuan per dan. The market atmosphere is still very stable. It is learned that the company still has a batch that is currently being negotiated with the Chiu Hing Tea Company. It is said that the two sides are not far apart, and the problem can be solved smoothly. As for other varieties such as Special Grade and Special Eyebrow, each has its own supply and demand, and the process is lively. As for black tea, which is watched by British export houses, the situation is again stagnant because the importers are suppressing prices and the suppliers are reluctant to sell. Domestic sales of red and green tea are scarce, and the market is as calm as ever.</p>
<h3>Tea Purchase Problem; Hope for Early Resolution</h3>
<p>The government ordered the Central Bank to purchase tea at the end of the lunar year last year to alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants and approved the purchase center price. More than two months have passed, but it has not been realized. In the blink of an eye, the Qingming Festival is approaching, and the new tea is on the market. The old tea has not been sold, and how will the new tea develop? This issue is not only a concern for the tea industry itself, but also for those who are concerned about international trade. According to the tea industry, the recent official market price is 1 million yuan to 850,000 yuan for Qimen tea, 515,000 yuan to 460,000 yuan for Pinglu tea, and 610,000 yuan for Red tea. Since the responsible authorities do not allow the requested price increase, it seems that they can allow tea merchants with sales capabilities to prepare funds to redeem the pledged tea, so as to avoid delaying the time and causing stagnation.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Buying Wind Rises Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In recent days, the raw material market has been very quiet, but the market suddenly turned hot yesterday, the money supply was loosened, and there were frequent low-priced additions. The price of caustic soda rose by about 10%. The highest price for the Moon Brand was 4.7 million yuan, and the selling price of American goods was 4.65 million yuan. Because Yung Lee's goods are shipped to North China, there has been no arrival of goods for a long time. The inventory of Moon Brand and Maccalli goods has also declined, and the market situation is firm. The market price has also risen by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Transition Between Old and New, the Work of the Import and Export Committee Is Stalled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the chairman of the executive committee of the Temporary Import Management Committee, Tsu Yi, and the executive committee member Lin Wai-ying resigned, the committee's work has been suspended invisibly. It is heard that the executive committee member and director of the Import Management Office, Chang Fook-wan, the executive committee member and director of the Secretariat, Chan Cheung-tung, and the acting director of the Secretariat, Yu Ying-kit, also have the intention to leave. As for the issue of whether the executive committee member and director of the Quota Allocation Office, Li Kon, will stay or leave, he himself has not expressed a clear opinion. It is heard that various import licenses have also been temporarily suspended. However, internal work is still proceeding as usual. In addition, the Quota Allocation Office still claims that it is continuing to expedite the quota allocation work as usual. It is understood that the future development of the committee's work will be decided after Chang Chia-ngau convenes a meeting of the executive committee. The date of the meeting will be in a week.</p>
<p>[Also] The executive committee of the Export Promotion Committee, because most of the executive committee members are designated, so except for the chairman, Pei Tsu-yi, who resigned due to his resignation as the president of the Central Bank, there is expected to be no change. However, the committee will also not convene an executive committee meeting within a week due to the transition between the old and the new.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>The market for bituminous coal fines is continuing to weaken due to the period of coal allocation and distribution, and the market price is falling again. Although the trend of bituminous coal lumps is relatively stable, the market price has also slightly declined. Only the high-grade white coal lumps are still standing firm at the peak price due to the scarcity of arrivals. Low-grade goods are also affected by the weakness of bituminous coal and have slightly declined. Although there is a shortage of white coal fines in the market, sales are also sluggish due to the high price. Charcoal is generally squeezed down due to the slump in the coal market.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Digests Plainly; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains Turn Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market had a strong source and digested plainly, with a total of more than 18,000 shih arriving. The price of japonica rice in the north and south was high, flat, and successively reduced, and the middle and lower returns were small by more than 1,000 yuan. White yuan was firm, and Yin yuan had no honor or disgrace. Indica rice was in a flat and weak position.</p>
<p>The oil market was quite turbulent. Raw materials fell, the market was sluggish, soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, raw oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, clear oil fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan, and sesame oil also fell by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The transaction of soybean cake was scarce, and the market form was not good. Northeast and Yangtze River soybeans are gradually pouring in, the digestion is clear and loose, the market situation continues to go downstream, and the price falls by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Sesame also showed softening and returned to a small 3,000-5,000 yuan. The sale of raw kernels was also sluggish, and the price fell by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Broad beans were extremely sluggish, and the price fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. Green beans also fell by a small 3,000-5,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed the decline by 1,000 yuan. However, red beans were uniquely strong, rising in price by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and were still smart. Cowpeas were firm. The powder market became weaker due to the arrival of Changxi Benfen, and the price fell by a small 1,000 yuan. Foreign rice followed the trend and was flat and soft. Wheat bran, in rural villages, was looking forward to the supply of relief wheat bran, and people's hearts were weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Today, the prices of various grains have fallen unanimously.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Edible Oil Distributed</h3>
<p>7,300 dan of soybean oil</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sheng Hai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office has already distributed 1,100 dan of sesame oil and 7,300 dan of soybean oil in the first cycle since the resumption of oil distribution. If the delivery procedures for this batch of edible oil can be completed before this Friday, the second cycle of edible oil distribution can be started on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Calms Down</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Business Association received instructions from Mayor Wu and the director of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating that the recent rise in the oil market in Shanghai was purely due to merchants manipulating transactions. The authorities maintained the distribution volume of legitimate civilian edible oil and would never interrupt it, so it would never be affected. It is hoped that the industry will quickly investigate and rectify itself and not engage in illegal transactions. The association will notify all members separately to investigate and put on record, so the oil market turned calm yesterday.</p>
<h3>10,000 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Are Distributed Monthly, Maintaining a Flat Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Chao-hung, chairman of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, recently made a statement regarding the report that the distribution price of Taiwan sugar would be adjusted. He said that the company has always恪守 the price stabilization policy of the Resources Committee, and the distribution price has not only been lower than the market price, but also has been stable. And the monthly distribution quantity is also enough for the needs of the city. The company's distribution quantity is still maintained at 10,000 tons per month. The average monthly distribution is four times, that is, each issue is still distributed four times, that is, each issue is still distributed 2,500 tons. As for the supply of sugar to public education personnel, the company negotiated with the Bureau of Social Affairs in both Beijing and Shanghai separately, and the company delivered sugar to the Capital Consumption Supply Office and the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Consumption Cooperative on a monthly basis, which was converted into a flat-price distribution.</p>
<h3>Peruvian Fine Sugar Down Another 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was soft, and the price continued to loosen. The association划盘ed the price of Peruvian fine sugar at 200,450 yuan, down another 10,000 yuan. 24 grade white 228,000 yuan.

Diao靑 dozens of bags, 127,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Trend Downward; The Market is Full of Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market was full of喊聲 in the black market because all the silk shops had to pay taxes and deliver fixed orders, and they were eager to sell. The asking price continued to trend downward. No. 120 Takayama Shiny opened at 7.1 million yuan in the morning and closed at 6.9 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan from the previous day. Semi-gloss and other grades were scarce and the asking price remained the same. Factory business also fell yesterday. Foreign firms had no transactions. Grade B was quoted at 8.3 million yuan and there was no reply. Grade B of user silk was opened at 7.6 million yuan, a decrease of 300,000 yuan from the transaction price of foreign firms the previous day. There were few openings for the remaining grades, and the asking price also decreased by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The transaction of silk goods was still silent, and the asking price mostly remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk Exports This Year</h3>
<p>Can Maintain a Ratio of 8 to 2</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The joint meeting to decide this year's spring silk plan has not yet been decided due to changes in the personnel of the Central Bank. According to the business department of the China Silkworm Company, the basic standpoint of the China Silkworm Company is to take into account the costs of silkworm farmers and manufacturers, thereby assisting them in their development, and the amount of future loans is planned to be 90% of the actual needs. As for exports, some silk fabrics can be sold to Southeast Asia, and the bulk of exports to the United States is still raw silk. The acqusition of foreign exchange is of course more cost-effective in raw materials. However, the quality and color of domestic products do not fit the American society, and at the same time, the United States also has a large number of factories, so its demand for foreign countries is raw materials rather than finished products. Moreover, the production capacity cannot meet the needs of other countries. Therefore, the ratio of silk exports this year will not exceed a ratio of 8 to 2.</p>
<h3>Too High Production Costs; Intestine Casing Exports Are Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the Central Bank's exchange rate for the pound sterling has been lowered, the export material that has encountered the same difficulties as tung oil is the intestine casing exporter. The price of the intestine casing to Europe was originally higher than that of New York, but due to the shortening of the British exchange rate, it is now equal to the New York market price. According to the New York market price a month ago, the price per pair fell from US$0.62 to US$0.50 to US$0.52, and the market situation was quite weak. The converted national currency of light intestine per barrel of 1,250 pairs is about 7.8 million yuan. After deducting freight and other expenses of about 1 million yuan, the total is 6.8 million yuan. However, the manufacturing cost of Shanghai intestine, the purchase price of fresh intestine per pair is 2,400 yuan, and the production cost of each type is 7.6 million yuan. In fact, it is higher than the foreign market price, and export is difficult. It is estimated that the minimum monthly export volume of intestine casing can reach 700 barrels, and the annual export volume is 8,000 barrels, which can be exchanged for US$52 million, which is not a small amount. However, according to the current solution to the difficulties, the purchase price of fresh intestine should be lowered to within 2,000 yuan per pair, so that the production cost can be reduced, and the production funds of manufacturers can be revitalized as much as possible. If the financial industry can provide a large amount of loans, designate its export to settle the bandit and recover its principal and interest, then the export prospects should be improved.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Trends Downward; Prices in Producing Areas Remain Firm</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a merchant in this city, the recent tung oil market situation is that because the price of the pound sterling has been lowered, the cost of shipping to British regions in Europe is equivalent to a 20% discount, which is almost the same as the New York market price. If calculated at £220 per ton, the converted price per city dan is 440,000 yuan. After deducting interest, taxes, freight, insurance, etc., the export price per city dan is at most 340,000 yuan. The New York market price is US$0.37, and the current price converted to national currency is 444,000 yuan. After deducting foreign expenses, it can only be exported to 360,000 yuan. Today's tung oil market is hit by this sudden blow from exports. Although the asking price is around 400,000 yuan per dan, I am afraid there is still a downward trend. The yesterday market price in Hankow was 398,000 to 400,000 yuan, Chongqing was 300,000 yuan, and Zhejiang (Hangzhou) was 380,000 yuan. Tunxi was 360,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Approved a Loan of 5 Billion to Purchase Northern Jiangsu National Cotton</h3>
<p>The Great Life Textile Company previously applied for a loan of 20 billion yuan to purchase national cotton from Northern Jiangsu. The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs transferred the loan to the Four Banks for approval. It is now learned that because the National Bank has not established an institution in Nantong, the Four Banks approved the National Bank to deposit 5 billion yuan in the Bank of China in Nantong first in the form of consignment. The local Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will provide loan to each yarn factory according to a ratio of 3:3:2:2 for cotton collection. The target will be handled by each factory designated by the Textile Management Committee.</p>
<h3>Before Peace and Order Are Restored, the Central Bank's Policies Will Not Change Suddenly; Secretary Kim's Statement to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Chang Chia-ngau, the president of the Central Bank. Chang had not yet arrived at the office, so he spoke with his secretary, Kim Hou-cheng. Kim said that Chang had given a detailed talk on his views on the current economic and financial situation in China on the day he took office. Moreover, the National Government has just promulgated a new economic emergency measures plan, and the Central Bank should also complete its mission under the overall strategy. Kim believes that there is no lack of criticism from the outside world on the various economic measures implemented by President Song in the past, but most of them are irresponsible criticisms. Now, because domestic peace and order have not yet been restored, the national revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced for a while. During this period, it is often difficult for the Central Bank to drastically change its previous policies. He hopes that after the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the intricate and complex relationship between the entire international community can be clarified, so that the issue of domestic peace and order in China can move from emotional to rational resolution. Then other secondary issues can also be resolved at the same time.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Rise; The Authorities' Admonitions Have No Effect; The Market Has to Close Early</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw an even bigger surge, because the textile construction allocation on the previous day was insufficient, causing buying interest from all parties. In addition, weaving factories frequently added allocations for 20s and 42s, causing all counts to rise by 100,000 to 200,000, so that the transaction price has exceeded the textile construction listed price by 5%. The chairman of the Yarn Business Association, Tang Chi-liang, and the two committee members, Wu and Gu, warned the industry in public to abide by the price limit for buying and selling, so as to avoid government interference. However, although the words were earnest, they could not curb the rising trend, so they had to ring the bell to close the market early.</p>
<p>The initial opening of the cotton cloth market for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was flat, and the price per piece was still 153,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the yarn market was performing well, and the price of cloth sold by the textile construction company was higher for the stacked list than for the spot, which made the buying interest stronger and people's hearts firmer. Longtou cloth rose step by step, and finally reached 160,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan from the previous day. The prices of other brands also followed up by 3,000-5,000 yuan. However, there was a glut of 190 American Shilin spot goods, and the price was down by a small 10,000, to 370,000 yuan. The market for colored cloth, serge, etc. was firm.</p>
<h3>Yarn Business Association Holds a Meeting to Study the Reasons for the Surge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the authorities stipulated that the transaction price of the cotton yarn market in this city should not exceed 5% of the listed price of national and private yarn factories, the past transaction situation was quite able to abide by the regulations. However, in recent days, the Valley Factory has not opened much yarn, and the demand from customers is eager. Yesterday at around 11:30 a.m., there were not many sellers in the market, but there were still many buyers raising prices to collect yarn, and there were cases where the legal profit exceeded 5%. The market manager felt that the responsibility was too heavy, so he asked the person in charge of the yarn and cloth group of the Economic Supervision Team for instructions. It was believed that transactions that exceeded the legal profit should be strictly cracked down. If there are still exceeding cases today, the market should be suspended for one day. After hearing the news, the Yarn Business Association immediately convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and they all believed that the suspension of the market would lead to adverse consequences such as fluctuations in yarn prices, which did not seem to be a good policy. They then consulted with the person in charge of the yarn team again. It was heard that the person in charge said that he could not be responsible for the consequences of the suspension of the market, so it was decided to open the market today. However, the directors and supervisors of the Yarn Business Association and the person in charge of the yarn and cloth team decided to convene a meeting at 9:30 a.m. today to study the reasons for the surge in cotton yarn prices in order to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Statistics for January; About 2 Billion Less Than in December</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The total amount of overseas remittances in January was 1,678,059,465.47 yuan, which was nearly 2 billion yuan less than in December of last year. The overseas remittance figures for each important location are: New York: National currency 629,710,558, US$137,440.6. London: £26,137 8 shillings 4 pence. Havana: National currency 123,282,855 yuan. Sydney 13,459,082 yuan. Calcutta 49,625,548.50 yuan. Yangon: 13,086,000 yuan. Saigon: 27,708,871.92 yuan. As for overseas remittances this month, due to the adjustment of the exchange rate, all parts of Southeast Asia have increased.</p>

<h3>Jinyun Mountain Foothills, Jialing River Banks: A Scenic Corner of the Capital, Beibei Under Construction</h3>
<p>— Chongqing Airmail, February 18th, Peng Zi</p>
<p>Eight years of war once transformed Beibei, following the changes of Chongqing City, into the unique darling of the Southwest. It changed from a country bumpkin to a most modern girl, from a desolate wasteland to a civilized city, and from a suburb with the most backward education to the pagoda of a cultural zone. Xiaba, on its opposite bank, is one of the famous "higher cultural sites" of Sichuan Province, while "Beiquan," on its left, is a renowned scenic spot praised by everyone.</p>
<p>Source of Culture, Avenue of Construction: The flames of war brought prosperity to the entire Southwest, and Chongqing became the center of administration and commerce during the war of resistance. Hundreds of millions of people came from the endless Yangtze River to this mountain city shrouded in misty seasons, and even more millions transferred to Beibei. Many people left traces of their fleeting lives here, and many spent their leisurely years in this embrace surrounded by mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Beibei, full of vitality and a source of life, this beautiful scenic area on the banks of the Jialing River has expanded. Politically, it has independently become a provincial-level institution – the Beibei Administrative Bureau. Thus, this place was once the "Second Lushan" for party and state dignitaries, and men of letters and poets, to build "waterside residences" or perhaps "seek ancient books." As a famous cultural and scenic area, strangers would fantasize about it as a miracle that could not be painted. The relocation of several institutions of higher learning is painstakingly opening up the source of culture in this corner of the Bashu mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Today, after the war of resistance ended and institutions moved eastward, perhaps taking away more of Beibei's population, this city, nurtured by culture, is embarking on the avenue of construction under industrial prosperity. The massive project of the Dashiliang Hydropower Plant, the direct tramway to Yubei, and the Jialing River Bridge – these are all worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Electrifying Eastern Sichuan: Relying on Beibei</p>
<p>Following the Tennessee Valley Authority project, every corner of China is actively harnessing rivers and utilizing hydropower. The Jialing River is one of the faster-flowing rivers in Sichuan Province. From Hechuan downstream, from Xixiakou to Beibei, the water is steep and dangerous, with natural rock formations, resembling the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Although the mountains and water power are not as majestic, the local residents call it the "Little Three Gorges," that is, the Three Gorges on the Jialing River. After successive inspections and surveys by American hydraulic engineers and experts specially dispatched by the Water Resources Commission of our Executive Yuan, it was determined that the water power could be utilized to build a large hydropower plant. Starting from Dashiliang on the upper reaches of Beibei, three dam base caves will be built, each 50 meters deep. The above-ground dam construction will involve 1.4 million cubic meters of stone. The entire project can be completed in three years. During floods, it can generate 80,000 kilowatts, and during low water, it can generate 60,000 kilowatts. All construction expenses were negotiated by Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, and it was decided that the project would be jointly invested by Minsheng Company, the Resources Commission, and the Canadian government. Based on current living standards, it is estimated to require US$8 million. Eight generators, each with a capacity of 10,000 kilowatts, have been ordered in the United States. The experts in charge of the project will be selected by the Canadian government and our Executive Yuan. The Beibei Administrative Bureau is currently mobilizing laborers to build the dam base, and it is expected to officially commence construction next spring. Once this hydropower plant on the Jialing River is completed, it will likely supply electricity to Chongqing and the counties along both banks of the Jialing River, making the eastern part of Sichuan a small electrified world. At the same time, it can regulate floods and droughts on both banks of the Jialing River. Upstream of the Little Three Gorges, large inland river ships of up to 3,500 tons can navigate.</p>
<p>Under the principle of developing Beibei's electrification and construction, it is planned to build a direct tramway to Yubei, starting from the Dashiliang Hydropower Plant area in Beibei and ending in the eastern suburbs of Yubei. Following a straight line, the entire journey will be only 40 kilometers, and the tram ride will take only two hours. All construction costs and plans will be shared by the Beibei and Yubei authorities, and construction can also commence next spring. Public servants and teachers will be given a 20% or half-price discount, making future Beibei a weekend getaway for public servants and teachers in Yubei and making future Beibei the center of electrification in eastern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Building a Bridge, Adding Scenic Spots</p>
<p>There has never been a bridge across the north and south banks of the Jialing River. Therefore, the Beibei local authorities plan to build a Jialing River Bridge to connect direct traffic between Beibei and Xiaba. Surveying began several months ago. The highest flood level is 52 feet, and the lowest water level is 8 feet. The total length is approximately 1,000 meters. The water-inundated stone beam next to the hydropower plant is used as the east bank bridge base point. Work has already begun to fill the stone foundations of the bridge piers on both banks, and it can be completed in one year.</p>
<p>The historical and cultural landscapes of forests and springs are the unique advantages of Beibei as a scenic cultural area. In addition to the Beiquan Park Management Office separately established for Beiquan, Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, and local gentry Mr. Wu Congju have invested in repairing all the historical sites and scenic spots in Beiquan, most of which are in good condition and truly spectacular. General tourists, appreciating the scenic spots, all have a feeling of beauty and longing. However, there are still a few scenic spots, such as the Feilai Pavilion on the highest peak of the park, which has been damaged. Overlooking the outside scenery of the park from there, it resembles a summary of a legal case. The Baiting Pavilion under the pavilion, which was inscribed by President Yu Youren as Qingshan Lvshui Baiting Pavilion, is also preparing to be renovated and become a standard weekend getaway for public servants and teachers in Chongqing. Beibei has built a new National Assembly Hall, which is magnificent in scale, only lacking the equipment for heating and cooling pipes.</p>
<p>The prospect of sports and culture is to expand on the existing good foundation, which can be divided into two parts. One is to add various facilities to the "People's Sports Field" and increase indoor facilities, and regularly hold sports meets. Expanding the library and science museum: "Beibei Library" is a spiritual food storehouse in Beibei, with a collection of more than 400,000 books, and some books that are now out of print. In fact, the museum was the "Minsheng Company Employee Library." Recently, it was invited by the Beibei authorities to move, which is also due to the close relationship between the Beibei administrators and Lu Zuofu. Therefore, in terms of Beibei's construction, Minsheng Company's achievements are paramount. In the future, it is planned to expand it and become a standard library in Sichuan Province. Beibei Science Museum, now renamed "China Western Museum," has a rich collection, collecting all kinds of special products related to the west and the country, especially the large-scale models in the mineral and mechanical exhibition rooms, which are exquisite. It is planned to expand and enrich it: it is one of the important parts of the Beibei construction plan. The Canadian government recently informed Lu Zuofu that it will donate a modern small mechanical model to the "China Western Museum." Soon, it will be brought back by the new Minsheng Company ship, which will be of great help in enriching the cultural development of Beibei.</p>
<p>Expanding Industry, Developing Minerals</p>
<p>The Beibei jurisdiction originally had the largest mining combination in Sichuan Province – Tianfu Coal Mine Company, which mines in Baimiaozi and Houfengyan in the Beibei jurisdiction. The company has its own railway, 30 kilometers long. The mining volume and mineral quality are the best in Sichuan Province. There is also Fuyuan Coal Mine Company in Xixiakou, north of Beibei, and Daming Textile Factory in the western part of the urban area, covering an area of about 100 acres and employing thousands of workers, which can be expanded due to the power generation of the "Dashiliang Hydropower Plant," making Beibei electrified and industrialized.</p>
<p>Enriching the cadres at all levels in Beibei and making them the backbone of the future northern region is also one of the most important policies of the Beibei authorities. The past cultural development has laid a foundation. The Beibei Children's Welfare Area of the Ministry of Social Affairs is perfectly constructed and is a model in primary school education. The secondary school has the famous Jianshan Middle School in eastern Sichuan, which is run by Lu Zuofu and can also be said to be indirectly presided over by the Beibei authorities. In addition, there are national women's teacher's affiliated middle schools, Mianren Lixin Senior Commercial Vocational School, etc. Higher education has the Xianghui College in Xiaba, which are all ideal construction cadres for the Beibei authorities. At the same time, running public schools by local authorities is also part of the plan.</p>
<p>"Building Beibei, Electrifying Eastern Sichuan" can be realized in just three years. The local authorities are currently doing their best to look forward to a bright future.</p>
<h3>Hidden Worries of the Food Adjustment Agency: A Glimpse of the Zhenjiang Flour Mill</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang Express News, February 2nd, Our Reporter Ge Xianglin</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Flour Mill is the only large factory in the provincial capital. The reporter recently visited the factory and was accompanied by the factory to tour the various departments of the factory.</p>
<p>Magnificent Appearance, Beautiful Environment</p>
<p>The factory site is located in the northwest of Zhenjiang, covering an area of more than 50 acres. The factory buildings are quite spacious, with a five-story steel-concrete machine room that can accommodate machines producing 7,000 bags of flour per day, standing on the Xinhe River embankment. In Zhenjiang, it is considered the tallest and largest building. There are more than a dozen large warehouses, all surrounding the machine room, which can accommodate nearly 200,000 large bags of wheat, 300,000 bags of flour, and 100,000 large bags of bran. In addition, there are material dining rooms, medical teams, repair rooms, silk drawing rooms, offices, and more than 40 staff dormitories for workers to live in, but because part of the staff dormitory is occupied by military police, the factory inevitably suffers from housing shortages. The factory is adjacent to the long-defunct alcohol factory, and behind it is the scenic Jinshan Temple. In front of it is the match factory, so the factory is not only magnificent in appearance, but also has a very beautiful environment.</p>
<p>Six Departments of Equipment, Still Considered Perfect</p>
<p>The factory's equipment is divided into six departments: power, wheat cleaning, flour making, packaging, and repair. The power department has two diesel engines with 520 horsepower and 175 horsepower, and a 680 horsepower motor. The flour-making department only has the equipment of a steel mill, which is still usable. From a modern perspective, although most of these machines are not new, they are still one of the well-equipped factories in the Jinghu area in China, which is currently backward in industry.</p>
<p>Transportation is Quite Convenient</p>
<p>Another unique advantage is that it is built on the right bank of the Xinhe River. Wheat boats can directly reach the factory gate. Zhenjiang West Railway Station and the riverside station are not far away, and trucks can directly reach the factory. Transportation is very convenient, which is of great benefit to business. However, it is said that the Xinhe River is dry in spring, and ships are not easy to enter - it is hoped that the water conservancy authorities will pay attention to the issue of dredging in the future. In addition, the factory is only separated by a river from the wheat-producing area in northern Jiangsu. Usually, it does have a geographical advantage in terms of raw material supply. However, even today, when northern Jiangsu is not very stable, it is inevitably affected to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Directly Managed by the Food Department</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the factory to the reporter: The factory was founded in the second year of the Republic of China, originally named Yicheng Flour Mill. It was not until the 25th year of the Republic of China that it began to take shape. During the Anti-Japanese War, the owner was unable to operate it, and all the shareholders announced the dissolution of the liquidation and sold it to the Japanese firm Xinjing Foreign Firm, which then increased its shares to expand its business and changed its name to Zhenjiang Flour Mill. After the victory, the factory was taken over by the Food Department and handed over to the Jiangsu Field Tax and Food Administration Office for direct command and supervision. Hong Qichen, Deputy Director of the Field Tax and Food Administration Office, was appointed as the director, and Shen Hengshan was the deputy director. There are six sections and offices under the department, including general affairs, business, engineering, materials, and accounting. There are currently more than 50 employees, who work together in a division of labor, and the management is also quite strict.</p>
<p>Limited Horsepower, Low Output</p>
<p>Under the wave of the current industrial depression, factories are frequently encountering difficulties, and the Zhenjiang Flour Mill is no exception. It is said that the factory had considerable difficulties at the beginning of its takeover. The first was the raising of working capital, and the second was the inability to supply a large amount of electricity in Zhenjiang. After several attempts, fortunately, the factory had diesel engines. After rushing to repair, reorganize, and add parts, it changed to using diesel to drive the machines and managed to operate hard. Finally, on April 14th last year, it officially resumed work and milled the first bag of flour after the victory. However, the horsepower of the diesel engine is limited, and it can only drive one-third of all machines. It is estimated that the daily output can reach about 3,000 bags. Since the start of work, the factory has indeed done a lot of work in terms of military food supply, civil food adjustment, and refugee relief. Because of the limitation of insufficient power, the factory's machines cannot be fully operated, so the direct technical workers required are only more than 100 people. At present, there are about 200 people, including dock coolies, temporary workers, and indirect workers, for a total of less than 300 people, including employees. However, it is estimated that the number of people who rely on this flour mill to maintain their lives directly and indirectly is more than 3,000. It can be seen that the large-scale start-up of factories is of great help in solving social unemployment and refugee relief problems.</p>
<p>Difficult to Collect Materials, Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>However, now, the factory is also inevitably encountering the current difficulties in business, just like other flour mills. The first is that raw materials are not easy to purchase, and sometimes the supply is interrupted, which inevitably leads to shutdowns. During the shutdown period, various expenses cannot be reduced by a single point. If the factory is shut down, it will be difficult for the factory to compensate, and it will inevitably be unable to maintain it. The second is that there are few export goods (flour), sales are stagnant, and funds are invisibly frozen, and the entire business will inevitably fall into a state of paralysis. This is the most difficult thing for the factory at present, and it is hoped that all parties will come up with the strength to rescue the crisis of this food adjustment agency.</p>

<p>Artificial Kerosene is Easy to Cause Disaster</p>
<p>Editor: Recently, fires have occurred frequently, and the loss of life and property of citizens has been severe. Instead of investigating afterwards, why not take precautions? Statistics on the causes of previous fires show that many were caused by the burning of kerosene. Greedy merchants and distributors are selling artificial kerosene to make huge profits. Users are unaware and think it is cheap, so they compete to buy it, but they do not know that they are setting themselves on fire, and it is too late to regret! Because the raw materials of artificial kerosene are diesel, Su La oil, or rosin water, plus gasoline and other products. If gasoline is not added, the odor is heavy, the firepower is weak, the wick is hard, and waste is excessive, so it is necessary to add highly volatile gasoline to cover it up. However, if it is burned for a long time, the oil pot is heated, and the gasoline is easily expanded into gas and explodes, causing a disaster that cannot be contained, not only causing damage to itself, but also endangering the neighbors. The harm of this matter can penetrate into rural villages and towns, so it should be strictly noted. Therefore, when buying kerosene, you must pay attention to the quality. Especially recently, the so-called flat-price kerosene on the market, selling for 700 or 800 yuan per catty, is highly dangerous artificial kerosene. Because the wholesale price of Mobil and other companies is more than 1,100 yuan per catty, there is absolutely no reason for the selling price to be lower than the cost. Citizens must not be greedy and buy it. The plan to get to the root of the problem has three points: (1) The municipal authorities strictly ban manufacturers and vendors of artificial kerosene. (2) The police station should send personnel to investigate kerosene retailers and accept citizens' reports. If anyone buys, sells, or hides artificial kerosene, they should be charged with endangering public safety. (3) Citizens should mutually advise their neighbors not to buy artificial kerosene to protect their own safety. If they find that a shop has adulterated artificial kerosene, they should report it from a public morality standpoint and widely publicize it. In fact, most kerosene buyers are nearby. In case of a fire, the shop itself may also be affected. Even if they make a fortune by artificial kerosene, it is exchanged for the lives and property of others. Ill-gotten gains cannot be held for long, please think twice! (Ming)</p>
<h3>Wealth and Benefit for the People Timber: Teak Planting Method, Eagerly Awaiting Widespread Trial Planting by the People</h3>
<p>— Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Liu Jun'e</p>
<p>More than 33 years ago, I was invited by the British Indian government to transfer from Rong to Yu and fly to India to work on insect research at the Darala Royal Forest Institute. Darala is located on the southern foothills of the Jia Malaya Mountains, approximately 30 degrees north latitude. The temperature is similar to that of Shanghai. I saw a large area of teak trees planted in the tree planting trial area of the institute, with as many as hundreds of trees, all without branches, but standing more than ten feet high. At that time, I paid special attention to it.</p>
<p>It is found that teak is a kind of expensive timber, easy to plant and fast to become timber. The wood is hard and dense, naturally light yellowish-brown. The best point is that any woodworm cannot bore it. Not only can it be used to make beds, cabinets, furniture, mirror frames and other decorations, but it can also be used as building materials, national defense materials, railway sleepers, and shipbuilding. The selling price is quite high, and those who plant it will make a lot of profit. In addition to successful trial planting in its tropical territories, the British government has also successfully trial planting in northern India. A plan has been set to increase planting by 1,500 acres in Myanmar and 4,600 acres in India each year. The successive central forest officers stationed in India have all written special publications on the research on teak planting, and its wealth and benefit for the people can be imagined.</p>
<p>The roof slabs of the houses of officials and staff at the Darala Research Institute are infested with termites and must be replaced every three to five years. Otherwise, there is a risk of falling. However, the beams, pillars, doors, windows, top panels, floors, and all wooden parts of the "Official Reception Center" and the director's residence are completely made of teak, and there is never a danger of termite damage.</p>
<p>The natural distribution area of teak trees in India and Myanmar is approximately 5 to 26 degrees north latitude; the artificial planting area is approximately 20 to 30 degrees north latitude. Since the British have achieved success in trial planting, the southern parts of Kang, Tibet, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces in our country, and the entire parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, must all be suitable for teak planting. Moreover, not only Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian had termites in the early years, but in the past two years, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other places have gradually had termites introduced. Since the victory and return to the original location, public and private agencies and people returning from the southwest to the east must have brought a lot of termites in their wooden boxes and woodenware. Therefore, I am eager to introduce this valuable and useful teak tree into our country and make it a domestic timber. Therefore, one or two months before leaving the Darala Research Institute in the winter of 34, I specially entrusted the central forest officer in the institute to purchase several pounds of teak seeds. He asked me for a mailing address, and was willing to wait for the teak seeds to be harvested in the spring of 35, and ordered his staff to send them as a gift. Now I have received a sack, which is very gratifying. Now I will translate the summary of the planting method of the teak seeds so that domestic forest agencies and individuals who are willing to try planting can send letters to ask for trial planting: (Mailing address: No. 3, Lane 2, Huacun, Wuyuan Road, Shanghai.)</p>
<p>(1) Soaking seeds: From early February to early March, soak the seeds in shallow pots of water for three days, remove the water and expose them to the sun for three days, then soak them for three days, then expose them to the sun for three days. Repeat this soaking and drying for about a month, and there will be an intention to germinate.</p>
<p>(2) Land preparation: During the seed soaking period, you should choose a place with a clear south facing, sufficient light, and fertile soil, loosen it to a depth of one or two feet, and water it to moisten it for future use (all grass roots and broken bricks should be removed from the soil, and any larvae should be killed).</p>
<p>(3) Sowing: When the seeds are about to germinate, draw several lines on the prepared land vertically and horizontally. The distance between each two lines is 5 inches. Dig a pit about the depth of a grave at the intersection of every two lines. Put a seed into each pit. Add soil about one inch thick to cover it. If you want to help it germinate early, you can also cover it with a little rice straw. The soil in the pit must always be kept moist, but not with standing water.</p>
<p>(4) Transplanting: After sowing, you must pre-select a piece of land with a south facing, sufficient sunlight, and fertile soil, loosen it to a depth of one foot, and often water it to moisten it. Wait until the seedlings grow to three to seven inches high, and have one or two pairs or two or three pairs of tender leaves (about one to three months), then you can move them and transplant them. Make the vertical and horizontal distance between every two plants 6 feet. In less than a year, they can grow to more than ten feet. (Each seed can produce three or four seedlings, but only one seedling is left in each plant's position, and the rest are removed.) If there are weeds bullying them, they should be removed.</p>
<p>[Announcement]: Those who send letters to this port to ask for teak seeds, please write clearly the name and address for registration. Each request for one hundred seeds costs 500 yuan in legal currency (please bring the money to get the seeds within three or four days after sending the letter).</p>
<p>Those who send letters from other ports, each hundred seeds costs 5,000 yuan. Each four hundred seeds costs 10,000 yuan (please attach five or ten thousand-yuan stamps in a registered letter, and the seeds will be mailed without delay.)],</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine</p>
<h3>Regarding Mr. Zhang Xixian's Thirteen-Ingredient "Lung Disease Effective Formula"</h3>
<p>— Mou Yunfang, Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Zhang Xixian, the police chief of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, suffered from lung disease for over four years. It would improve and then relapse. In the winter before last year, it relapsed again, with profuse hemoptysis. Many doctors were at a loss. Later, a friend passed on a thirteen-ingredient lung disease effective formula, and after taking more than twenty doses in a row, he walked as healthy as normal. Also, Mr. Wang Zuyang suffered from lung disease, and X-ray examination showed that the tissue of the left lung was completely destroyed, and the condition was serious. After taking this formula, he gradually recovered. Mr. Zhang, feeling the pain of his previous illness, wanted to widely disseminate this formula to help those who suffer from the same disease.</p>
<p>Since its publication in Shen Bao, it has attracted much attention. Some people spare no expense to re-stencil and distribute it, and it became popular overnight, spreading by word of mouth. From December 1st, sixteen pharmacies, including Hu Qing Yu Tang, donated and published large advertisements for the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association to promote effective national medicine formulas to help the poor and sick, and sponsored the donation of 20,000 doses. The Shen Bao's social service column reported on the donation process on December 22nd. Since the beginning, various pharmacies have enthusiastically supported the effort, and by December 18th, a total of 23,000 doses had been donated. This kind of benevolence and righteous act is commendable, but whether this formula has a truly effective treatment and whether it has other side effects is a question that urgently needs to be studied. On May 19th of last year, Mr. Chen Cunren of Shen Bao published the results of his research, believing that the formula has the effect of nourishing and tonifying the lungs, increasing fluid, dispelling heat, and nourishing blood. In response to inquiries in the Shen Bao's service column on June 3rd, he pointed out the irrationality of the original formula and, for the sake of rationality, modified the original formula. Therefore, I also need to discuss this effective formula.</p>
<p>My first criticism of this formula is that the use of Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica) and Hong Hua (Safflower) is unjustified. For lung disease with hemoptysis, using a small amount of Hong Hua can be said to be acceptable, but using Bai Zhi to treat lung disease is absolutely wrong. Mr. Chen said: "It is indeed necessary to consider when using Bai Zhi." I think there is no need to consider it. Bai Zhi is a diaphoretic medicine containing volatile oil with irritating properties. Not only should it not be used for lung disease with night sweats and tidal fever, but according to the logic of the prescription, it should not be an irrelevant and incongruous ingredient in such a formula. Mr. Chen said, "Bai Zhi should be changed to steamed Bai Bu (Stemona)," which is very reasonable because Bai Bu can treat chronic cough. Secondly, the dosage of the drugs is unreasonable. Mr. Chen said: "The dosage of Hong Hua and Gan Cao (Licorice) should be light, and the dosage of Sheng Di (Rehmannia glutinosa) and Bai Pi (Morus alba root bark) should be heavy." He revised the dosage of each drug in the original formula to make it reasonable. I think the dosage of Shu Di (processed Rehmannia glutinosa) also needs to be revised. If Shu Di is unnecessary and Sheng Di is already present, it's better not to use it. If Shu Di needs to be used, a dosage of two qian (a traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 3.7 grams) is too light.</p>
<p>The whole formula has thirteen ingredients. Apart from the incongruous Bai Zhi, it is what traditional Chinese medicine calls a "Gan Han" (sweet and cold) formula, which is effective for treating lung disease with dry cough, insomnia, irritability, dry mouth, and other symptoms of deficiency and excitement, which are so-called "Yin Deficiency with Fire Blazing" diseases. This is because "Gan Han" drugs have nourishing and calming effects. Although lung disease is a kind of Yin Deficiency with Fire Blazing disease, the patient's constitution and the causes are different, and the symptoms of lung disease are not uniform. Some have hemoptysis, some have night sweats, some have tidal fever, some have nocturnal emission, some have insomnia, and so on. The severity varies, so simply using "Gan Han" drugs will not be effective for everyone.</p>
<p>(Note: Mr. Chen Cunren's long article of more than a thousand words on the newly written effective formula for lung disease was published in the News on February 28th, and it was developed from recent experiments. Those who are concerned about this formula should refer to it.)</p>
<h3>Do Not Mistake the Following Symptoms for a Cold and Treat Them as Minor Problems!</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>The Inner Classic says, "Harm from wind in the spring." The climate in spring changes from cold to warm; however, at this time the cold has not subsided, and the warmth is only slowly emerging. The change between cold and warm is quite drastic, sometimes with spring cold snaps and sometimes with spring warmth. The regulation of body temperature is most likely to be disrupted, so colds arise, resulting in a wind-cold syndrome.</p>
<p>Mild colds may manifest as nasal congestion or itchy throat with coughing. Severe colds may involve chills and fever. They may heal without medication, or heal with diaphoretic medicines, or heal with two or three days of diaphoretic medicines. As for those complicated with other diseases, or those with weak lungs that develop complications, the treatment method will be more difficult. However, the general public's view is that colds are minor problems and not worth paying attention to; unaware that "a cold that does not heal turns into consumption" is meant to warn people against underestimating colds. Furthermore, most Chinese people do not pay much attention to medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, and are therefore ignorant of the identification of symptoms. Because the biggest symptoms of a cold are chills, fever, and cough, people often mistakenly think that anyone with chills, fever, and cough has a cold, delaying treatment and inevitably leading to major changes. This is not to be ignored, so it is specially pointed out.</p>
<p>Wind-Heat</p>
<p>Wind-heat is a type of typhoid fever. Its characteristics are intermittent fever that lingers and does not subside, similar to ordinary typhoid fever with a cough. At the beginning of the disease, there is a feeling of chills and an increase in body temperature, which is very similar to ordinary severe colds, so it is easy to overlook and delay treatment. Because as a result of overlooking it, not only is treatment not sought immediately, but the person may also work while sick, exhausting their physical and mental strength, consuming their resistance, like letting a wolf into the house. Or they may have no dietary restrictions, burdening their digestive work, leading to accumulation and indigestion, greatly affecting the stomach and intestines, and increasing the heat, like adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever requires dietary restrictions, which is common knowledge that everyone knows. People with colds, except for a loss of appetite and a desire to eat less, do not have the same dietary restrictions as in cases of typhoid fever. Therefore, the biggest adverse consequence of misdiagnosis is food stagnation, which is what the Treatise on Typhoid Fever calls "Yangming disease." Commonly referred to as "fire typhoid," "vertical head typhoid," and "leaky bottom typhoid," these are all dangerous symptoms of typhoid fever. The cause is mostly due to a lack of dietary restrictions. Wind-heat is mistaken for a cold, so the consequences are often unimaginable.</p>
<p>Lung-Wind</p>
<p>Lung-wind refers to shortness of breath, coughing with wheezing, fever that does not subside, which is what is now called pneumonia or bronchitis. The meaning of the word "wind" has two meanings: one refers to its source, meaning caused by wind-cold; the other refers to its symptoms, meaning that there is a danger of stirring up wind. The latter meaning is most easily seen in children who suffer from it, so children with pneumonia often have the possibility of seizures.</p>
<p>The occurrence of lung-wind is caused by exposure to wind-cold, where the virus reaches and harms the lungs, so the symptoms of the respiratory system are the most obvious. In the early stages, when the symptoms are still superficial, it is not difficult to mistake it for a cold. However, this disease changes quickly, and if medicine is not used early, or if the medicine is not appropriate, there will be major changes, endangering life.</p>
<p>Measles</p>
<p>Measles initially presents with fever, coughing with wheezing, runny nose, which is no different from a cold. It is not until four or five days later, when red spots appear around the ears, on the chest, and on the back, that it is known to be measles.</p>
<p>Measles is most afraid of wind-cold, which is known to everyone. In addition to wind-cold, diet should also be paid attention to. If measles is mistaken for a cold, the preventive measures will not be very careful, or there will be repeated exposure to wind-cold, binding its external defenses, preventing it from reaching the surface quickly, or being harmed by diet, causing loose stools, so taking the opportunity to invade internally, then the measles toxin will be entrenched internally, with the risk of sudden changes.</p>
<h3>Ginger</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>People only know that ginger is an ordinary vegetable seasoning, but if used properly, it can not only be palatable and filling, but also bring the dead back to life. Pickled ginger can treat nausea and vomiting, sugar ginger can cure abdominal pain, ginger tea can stop diarrhea, ginger and jujube decoction can stop malaria, and scallion and ginger noodles can induce sweating and cure colds. These are all significant and effective products in dietary therapy. If used in medicine, fresh ginger can dispel cold, release the exterior, stop vomiting, and resolve phlegm. When roasted with fire, the taste is acrid with a hint of bitterness, and its nature becomes very hot, removing cold in the stomach. When charred black, it has a charcoal-like effect and can also warm the meridians. If dried old ginger is used, it is dried ginger, which can warm and guard the middle energizer and strengthen the heart and calm the spirit. Other wonderful uses, such as ginger peel's ability to disperse water edema and ginger juice's ability to remove stubborn phlegm, are too numerous to mention. The spiciness of fresh ginger is not as stimulating as chili peppers, and it can also detoxify and remove filth, so those who cook fish and shrimp need ginger, and eating large crabs without ginger also feels uninteresting.</p>
<h3>Agrimony</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yanren</p>
<p>Agrimony's original name is Long Ya Cao (dragon tooth grass), commonly known as Tuo Li Cao (debility grass), named because it can treat debility and labor injuries. Its efficacy is described in detail in the Materia Medica and has always been valued by our Chinese medicine community. Since 1937, Professor Wu Yunrui of the Medical College of Fudan University in Shanghai tested the results, proposed the pure effective ingredients, and applied them to clinical practice, its effect is even more remarkable. In the past, this product was not only valued in the medical community, but the experimental merits have long been commonly used by the people. One often sees villagers who have debility, labor injuries, and hemoptysis picking it from the fields, exposing it to the sun, decocting it, and taking it, which has always been effective. Examining the nature of this product, it is bitter, astringent, and slightly warm, containing colloid, a mild compound, vegetable sterol, and a sweet substance, that is, vegetable mucilage, which has the effects of anti-inflammation, astringency, increasing cell resistance, and promoting blood coagulation. It has special effects for hemoptysis, nosebleeds, and uterine bleeding, especially for chronic weak patients and those who are weak and powerless after a serious illness. Regular consumption can also strengthen the heart and nourish it. A strong heart will improve blood circulation, and the complexion will become ruddy. It really has the effect of preventing disease and prolonging life. Among the domestic medicines, why is this product the only one? There are many effective ones, like mountain treasures, rare and wonderful things are lined up, and they are easy to pick up. Why not improve ourselves? Speaking of building Chinese medicine today, extracting the essence and improving medicines is a major prerequisite. I hope that the Chinese people will rise up together to do it.</p>
<h3>Cold Prevention</h3>
<p>— Shen Caizhi</p>
<p>(1) As the saying goes, "Don't wear too little in the spring breeze," which is the meaning of the ancient poem "The willow breeze blowing on the face is not cold," meaning the warmth of spring. However, the saying also goes, "Spring overcastness can freeze old oxen to death," which shows that the cold and warmth in spring are abnormal and the climate is changeable, especially in the first and second months of the lunar year. Therefore, in terms of clothing, pay attention to the thickness of clothing and do not adhere to seasonal clothing.</p>
<p>(2) When the sun is weak or the climate is cold and smoggy, and you feel cold, change your clothes at any time and never endure the cold by wearing single clothes. Those who go out should pay special attention to this point. As the saying goes, "Always bring clothes for the third and ninth months," which is to prevent catching a cold.</p>
<p>(3) After sweating, body temperature drops sharply, and the pores are not firm. The ability to prevent cold is weak. Wind and cold can easily enter, so do not sit or lie in the wind, seeking temporary comfort.</p>
<p>(4) When going out, if clothes are wet from rain or snow, find a way to change them quickly and do not force yourself to endure it.</p>
<p>(5) Bedding should not be too warm at night, because sleeping too warmly and exposing the body easily leads to colds.</p>
<p>(6) When getting up in the morning, do not open the window until your clothes are buttoned. Those in a warm room should not rush out; it is best to rub the face, forehead, nose, and heart with both palms before opening the window and going out to prevent catching a cold.</p>
<h3>Research on Using Cotton Thread to Treat Measles</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>The custom is to use boiled cotton thread to treat measles. This method is used to penetrate the measles when it first appears. I wanted to understand its nature, taste, and function, but when I looked through the Materia Medica, it was not mentioned. Although the Dictionary of Pharmacy has a statement about penetrating measles, it was not satisfactory. I thought about the difference between cotton and cotton thread in terms of categories, one is an agricultural product, and the other is an industrial product, so there must be differences; if analyzed chemically, there may not be much difference. If this thing really has a medicinal effect, then the flower and the thread have only gone through a spinning process, and the essence has not changed. Why not use cotton to treat measles, but insist on using cotton thread? Isn't there "a reason for everything"? One day, I happened to read Shao Qinfu's "Throat Measles, Diphtheria" chapter, in which there is a sentence: "If the neck is swollen on both sides, like a bag, it is the so-called throat measles bag. It is appropriate to add detoxification and swelling reduction products, such as silkworms, red peony, Belamcanda chinensis, puffballs, licorice, fritillaria, peach kernels, and green cotton thread." I couldn't help but suddenly understand!</p>
<p>Shao Qinfu's so-called throat measles, diphtheria, refers to two syndromes: ulcerative throat measles and diphtheria measles. Ulcerative throat measles is scarlet fever—also known as red measles—which the ancients often confused with the measles that occurred in children. Although the spots of scarlet fever are smaller than measles when they first appear, they soon densely cover the area, and the throat is very easily ulcerated; severe measles can also form patches and cause throat pain, and even ulceration. The special symptoms of scarlet fever, in addition to sore throat, include a tongue with raised papillae and a "triangular area" of the nose and mouth that does not develop red measles, so there is a clear white triangle; those with severe measles who develop pneumonia also have this symptom. The use of cotton thread was originally for ulcerative throat measles, so it is also used for measles.</p>
<p>However, the use of cotton thread to treat measles is for the throat symptoms, and not only is the throat ulcerated, but also swollen. Looking at the sentence in the article, "It is appropriate to add detoxification and swelling reduction products," the role of cotton thread is to detoxify and reduce swelling, and has nothing to do with penetrating the measles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the point to pay special attention to when using cotton thread is "green" cotton thread, not ordinary "unbleached" cotton. In old-fashioned dyeing workshops, blue is used indigo blue, and indigo blue can detoxify and reduce swelling, so the use of green cotton thread to treat "throat measles bags" is to take advantage of the power of indigo blue.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Preface to Essays on Drama</h3>
<p>— Ye Dejun</p>
<p>Last winter, I sorted out the papers and essays about Chinese novels and dramas I had written over the past ten years or so, estimating that there were more than 200,000 words. Many of the short essays were notes made to suit the length of the supplement, and the preparations were not very in-depth. There was really no need to publish these scattered chapters, so I resolutely deleted them all. The remaining papers were only 130,000 to 140,000 words, which were compiled into a book called "Collection of Essays on Vernacular Literature." "Rixin Literature Series" planned to include it, but due to the limitation of the number of words, it was difficult to include all of them. Therefore, I first extracted several articles on opera and compiled them into a book called "Essays on Drama" to let them meet the world first. The remaining textual researches on novels and ballads will be compiled into another book called "Fish Clothing Collection."</p>
<p>This thin booklet of 50,000 to 60,000 words only has six articles. Although it is inevitably thin, I still like it. I think: rather than writing general theories or outlines, it is better to write some special studies in a down-to-earth manner; writing a literary history without any original ideas is not as good as a solid small textual research. This is naturally just my idea and may not be agreed upon by others; however, I myself like to take this circuitous path. Although these short essays and textual researches may not be exhaustive, I always want to do my best to make them substantial. Naturally, there are also documents that have not been noticed, such as the author of "Taiping Yuefu," Wu Zhensheng. I did not think that Li Ji's "Qi Su Lei Zheng" actually had his biography. This kind of omission is inevitably a negligence, and the difficulty of complete textual research is certainly known to those who have experienced it.</p>
<p>I myself have no collection of books, let alone rare or precious books, and doing small textual research requires books as a basis, so the suffering is even deeper. The books cited in the essay "The Disaster of Performing the Palace of Eternal Life" are all ordinary Qing Dynasty documents, but if there were no provincial library for reference, it might not be possible to write it even now. I have collected a lot of documents about the old Lang and the Ming people's enthusiasm for opera, which can be written into a not very short paper, but in the end, because one or two Ming printed books have not been found, I had to let it run aground. The abandonment halfway through the compilation of historical materials of Ming Dynasty opera writers is also similar to the above situation. Textual research without books, wanting to have rich harvests, I am afraid it will become a vain wish. Having been trapped in the southern border for many years, what else can I say? When will I be able to use the library next to the Jinbie Yuzhuang Bridge that I once lingered and couldn't bear to leave? This is even more unpredictable. Although specializing in this kind of thing is inevitably a self-inflicted hardship, I still want to continue to do it as far as my ability allows. The result, of course, is difficult to predict. This is exactly: Bieshan Quhai are trivial matters, and I will spend my life studying the classics.</p>
<h3>Dream Traces</h3>
<p>— Yang Yifu</p>
<p>In my memories, it seems a piece of music is playing, like Chopin's "Serenade." It is filled with blue emotions, stirring the broken strings of my heart—that deep affection, deep melancholy, that boundless tenderness, boundless sorrow, causing me to be melancholic, to be sentimental, even to shed tears.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten that evening in the late autumn of 1943.</p>
<p>The pattering drizzle, the rustling cold wind, adorned the quiet twilight. After my illness, I lay quietly in bed, gazing at the irritating sky outside the window, so desolate, so bleak, and yet so lonely. Yes, lonely, I felt a loneliness I had never experienced before, waves of thoughts constantly rising and falling, broken and fragmented, intermittent. I was wondering: When will I recover my health? When will I be able to go to school? The motherland is in the midst of storms, and many people are dedicating their lives, while I am struggling in the pain of illness… I couldn't help but think of my many friends, thinking of the warm friendship they gave me, especially Hua Hua. He treated me so well. Thinking of him reminded me of the bright moon without a night robe, a lighthouse in the sea. He brought me warmth, brought me light, brought me hope, making me forget a lot of pain and reducing much of my loneliness. At this moment, I deeply realized the meaning of the phrase "To have a true friend, one can die without regret…"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crisp telephone ring interrupted my thoughts, breaking the silent atmosphere. I immediately got out of bed, walked to the desk, picked up the receiver, and heard my uncle's voice:</p>
<p>"…Is this Yifu? How are you these past two days? Are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Uncle, I'm better… Are you looking for Mom? She's out. Is there anything I can do?"</p>
<p>"She's out… Well, please tell her to pack my two leather suitcases. I'm coming to pick them up tonight."</p>
<p>"What? Uncle, are you leaving already? So soon?" I hurriedly asked him, "Then, what about Hua Hua and the others?"</p>
<p>"Hasn't he told you? We had already agreed to leave together…"</p>
<p>"Is this true? Hua Hua is leaving too?…" After hearing the words "Hua Hua is leaving too," I no longer heard anything else that was said. Finally, he hung up the phone. "I don't believe it, I don't believe it. He never said he was going to leave. This is impossible. Hua Hua can't leave me. I have to go see him…" I muttered to myself like a madman. I quickly put on my clothes, threw on my coat, and went downstairs. At this moment, I had forgotten that I was still a patient, a patient who needed to rest for half a year to recover. When I opened the front door, the old nanny who was taking care of me came out in surprise and asked me, "Miss Yifu, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>I didn't have time to explain to her. I hurriedly said to her, "I have to go out now. Tell Mom later that I'll be right back." I quickly closed the door. I only heard her calling me from inside the door, but I had already rushed out onto the street and jumped into a rickshaw.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped, and the wind was blowing relentlessly. I sat in the rickshaw, lost in thought, not knowing how much time had passed. The rickshaw had already reached the intersection of Shanzhong Road. I got out of the rickshaw and walked into a small alley. I gently rang the doorbell.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" It was Hua Hua's voice. I could tell.</p>
<p>"It's me, Hua Hua," I shouted involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Who? Yifu? How did you get here?" He walked out in surprise and took my hand.</p>
<p>"I thought you had already left…" Tears that I had been holding back for a long time were already hanging in the corners of my eyes. At that moment, I felt like I had gained everything in the universe.</p>
<p>"No, aren't I right here?" He said gently and calmly, "Yifu, how could you forget that you're still recovering from your illness… Okay, enough said. Hurry, I'll take you back right away." As he said that, he took my arm, and we quickly got back into a rickshaw.</p>
<p>The sky was already approaching evening, and in the hazy twilight, the streetlights gradually lit up.</p>
<p>"Hua Hua, I beg you not to leave me," I leaned against him and said softly.</p>
<p>"Yifu, let me tell you," he said slowly, each word striking my heart, "If you weren't sick, I would have already rushed to the land of freedom. It's because of you that I've delayed until now."</p>
<p>"Really? Hua Hua, thank you. But I'm afraid, I'm afraid I'll lose you."</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" He gazed at me. "Please believe me, Yifu. The first time I saw you, I liked you. I also have an incomprehensible feeling for you. It's admiration, it's worship, it's respect. I'm just the most ordinary person among ordinary people. However, I have my ideals, I have my beliefs. For the sake of the motherland, I must stick to my post and do my part. Yifu, I hope you can understand me and give me encouragement and comfort."</p>
<p>I raised my head, gazing at him, tears falling one by one. "Hua Hua, I understand you. Please forgive me for my selfishness just now."</p>
<p>"Don't say that. From now on, I will work harder for you."</p>
<p>"Hua Hua, go. I hope you can fulfill your ideals. I have nothing to say. I can only bless you. Hua Hua, please forgive me. I really don't have the courage to think about it anymore…"</p>
<p>"Yifu, don't talk too far ahead. When you're healthy, I'll come back to pick you up. Then, we can work together, live together. Are you happy?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I hope so too. But who knows what the future holds…"</p>
<p>"Believe me, Yifu, I won't forget you. I'll never forget you," he said passionately.</p>
<p>The rickshaw had stopped at Jiangning Road. We got out of the rickshaw and stood under the streetlight on the street. In the hazy night fog, he held my slender hands tightly and said, "You should be happy for me. Why are you sad and crying? Promise me you'll take good care of yourself."</p>
<p>I nodded slightly, opened my tearful eyes, and gazed at him, saying, "You must come back to pick me up, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in a few days, I'll definitely come back to pick you up." After saying that, he kissed my wet cheek. "Hurry up and go inside! Don't stand on the street. You'll catch a cold."</p>
<p>"No, I want to watch you leave first today," I said with a tearful smile.</p>
<p>He knew that I was very stubborn, so he said, "Okay, then I'll go first." He then walked forward. Suddenly, he turned around and said to me, "Why aren't you going home yet? It's very cold on the street. Hurry up and go inside! Goodbye!" After saying that, he quickly walked to the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p>"Goodbye!" I shouted loudly, "Are you coming to see me tomorrow?…" He didn't seem to hear me and gradually walked away. Only when his figure disappeared into the night fog did I lift my heavy steps and walk home.</p>
<p>When I got home, fortunately, Mom hadn't returned yet. I lay down on the bed and felt feverish all over, as if I were burning. So, I fell asleep without knowing anything.</p>
<p>When I was more conscious, Mom told me that Uncle and Hua Hua had already left.</p>
<p>After that, I spent lonely days, taking medicine, reading books, and listening to music at home every day. My health gradually improved. At the same time, I often received letters from Uncle and Hua Hua, knowing that they were both working on the front lines and that their work was extremely tense. They were probably unable to return to Shanghai for a while. But they said that they would find a way to pick me up when they had the opportunity. However, soon, transportation to Chongqing became increasingly difficult, and their letters gradually became less frequent.</p>
<p>Waiting, waiting, waiting every day for their news. Finally, I received Uncle's last letter, a few brief words telling me that Hua Hua had suddenly disappeared, his fate unknown. But this news had not been confirmed. It was simply a bolt from the blue. I was stunned for many days. But I didn't believe it. I had strong faith. I believed that this news was not true.</p>
<p>Finally, the bells of peace rang throughout every corner of the universe. With a half-joyful and half-fearful heart, I waited for their return. Sure enough, Uncle returned, and he confirmed the unfortunate news of Hua Hua's disappearance. His whereabouts are still unknown. But in this vast universe, where can I find him?</p>
<p>Although I am a stubborn girl, I couldn't restrain my emotions and couldn't help but shed tears. I didn't say a word, just wept silently to myself.</p>
<p>Uncle understood me best. He saw me enduring the pain, and unknowingly, I had obviously become depressed and haggard.</p>
<p>He often took me to the park for walks and accompanied me to concerts. But I couldn't cheer up. My heart became more and more depressed, as if a layer of deep blue was painted on a clean white cloth, symbolizing melancholy, sorrow, and endless mourning.</p>
<p>One day, Uncle suddenly said to me, "Yifu, are you going to be sad forever? Listen to me, maybe a change of environment will be good for you. How about I find a job for you? Would you be willing to try it?" For his kindness, I agreed.</p>
<p>So, I became a teacher at a church middle school, spending my time reading and grading papers every day. My mood slowly got better. Now, I feel that work is indeed the sweet cake of life. I understand the true meaning of life even more: Some people in the world live for others, and some people live for themselves. But people who live for others can obtain eternal happiness.</p>
<p>However, I can't forget Hua Hua. Every morning in the faint dawn, at dusk in the misty drizzle, or in the midnight of starry sky, his figure constantly lingered in my mind, surrounding my soul.</p>
<p>Every morning, when I walked to school, passing by that small chapel, I would always raise my head, gazing at the statue of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall. I was silently praying: Bless him with peace, bless him with a safe return. Although no one knows when he will return, I still prayed every day, praying and searching. (January 30, 1947)</p>

<h3>Snow Seals and Dissolves Guyuan – Memories Beyond the Great Wall</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>April,</p>
<p>Lonely Guyuan,</p>
<p>Receives the travelers of last night,</p>
<p>Receives that group,</p>
<p>Of people from afar riding in cars,</p>
<p>The people of Guyuan are amazed,</p>
<p>The people of Guyuan are staring at people from a mythical land,</p>
<p>The people from afar are depicting,</p>
<p>A primitive picture.</p>
<p>The next morning,</p>
<p>The sound of roosters awakens,</p>
<p>The primitive dream of the people from afar,</p>
<p>The people from afar compete with the sun to rise early.</p>
<p>But the dawn of Guyuan,</p>
<p>Has no bright colors.</p>
<p>The lonely sky and</p>
<p>The lonely earth face each other.</p>
<p>It is snowing in Guyuan,</p>
<p>Beautiful snowflakes,</p>
<p>Falling piece by piece on the dusty streets.</p>
<p>But the large convoy,</p>
<p>Braving the snow filling the sky,</p>
<p>Floats across the bright white carpet.</p>
<p>And the snow continues to fall,</p>
<p>Snowflakes cover the tracks of the vehicles,</p>
<p>Snowflakes, like fluttering white butterflies,</p>
<p>Holding the cold morning wind,</p>
<p>Dance in front of the vehicles,</p>
<p>Dance on the faces of the people in the vehicles.</p>
<p>The snow is getting heavier,</p>
<p>The earth is covered with a white blanket,</p>
<p>Soldiers wearing thick white velvet clothes,</p>
<p>Like piled snowmen,</p>
<p>Are towed away by snowplows,</p>
<p>Towed into the misty sea of snow.</p>
<p>The snow falls so silently,</p>
<p>The earth is so lonely!</p>
<p>Loneliness seals Guyuan,</p>
<p>The lonely people from afar,</p>
<p>Go to the lonely distance.</p>
<p>Note: Guyuan is in Gansu province, a stop on the way from Shaanxi to Ningxia.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 190</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>There is still something else. We can say that Yaoqun and Hucheng, from Mr. W's perspective, are in the position of a liaison organization. With Yaoqun and Hucheng, he can contact the organizations to which I and Tsurumi belong. And the potential forces in the Northeast are something that Mr. W should try to bring into cooperation, and the medium for this liaison, Hucheng and Yaoqun, should be the most suitable people. Moreover, although Hucheng is only a child of twelve or thirteen years old, because of his amazing martial skills and wisdom, no one in the mountains of the Northeast does not know him, no one does not admire him. Therefore, like Yaoqun, he is specially favored by Mr. W.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Mr. W's politeness to the two of them is not beyond reason.</p>
<p>Mr. W listened to Yaoqun's report, and saw that she had already answered the incoming calls according to his intentions, and thought it was very satisfactory. Only then did he leisurely signal to the young warrior who had just come in to report.</p>
<p>"...The advance scouts who were just sent out have encountered obstacles, and it seems that they are preparing for special operations. ...The lookout post in this building reports that the west, northwest, and southwest sides have suddenly been 'swept clean.' Within two thousand meters, there seems to be enemy surveillance!"</p>
<p>The people in the room could still remain calm after hearing this report, only Little Hucheng showed a slight agitation on his face. This agitation was due to two factors: The first factor was not entirely due to the stimulus of the report. From my observation, the main reason was still the hissing sound emitted by the special device's signal and the flashing, dazzling red light, which caused a reaction in his curiosity.</p>
<p>According to Mr. W's later telling us, this signal was originally a device that was kept in reserve. Before Song Zheyuan withdrew, there was nothing to be alarmed or reported at all. Even if the hidden forces of Japanese spies were very large, because this place was extremely well-protected, they could not detect it. Even if they did detect it, it was unlikely that they would dare to "disturb the earth on the head of a tiger" here. Now that Peiping has fallen, who would have thought that this thing that was kept in reserve would actually be used? It has actually come on stage to perform.</p>
<p>This set of things was originally arranged by the technical experts of the department. The alarm sound was not loud, but it was extremely harsh. The light was extremely strong. Even if it was released in the daytime, it was like a strong flash of lightning, dazzling and flowery. After it was installed, the main switch was set up in the main telecommunications room. Mr. Shi even issued an order for this: Except for the discovery of sudden dangers that affected the safety of the headquarters on the lookout posts such as outside the gate, in the hall, on the roof, etc., it was strictly forbidden to use it lightly.</p>
<p>With such a harsh hissing sound and glaring light bursting out at the same time, and with Tsurumi's various warnings and speculations beforehand, it was tantamount to the initial suggestion of hypnosis. How could a country child like Hucheng who had never been baptized by electricity not feel stimulated when he saw it? However, it was only limited to a kind of sensory stimulation, and there was no element of fear at all.</p>
<p>The second factor that caused him to be agitated can be said to be an expression of excitement, like a long-serving dragon horse in the battlefield, either smelling a bloody smell or hearing a burst of gongs and drums, thinking that there will be a good fight again, and then neighing vigorously, expressing that it can't wait to go to the battlefield immediately and gallop around.</p>
<p>As for Mr. W, he was of course more calm than us when he heard these reports. This calmness came purely from nature, without any pretense, not like what Shanghai people call "getting into character"; because he had a plan in mind. I only saw him pondering slightly, then picking up the direct phone in the building and issuing orders:</p>
<p>"Headquarters Number One, there are obstacles in the west, southwest, and northwest. Assault each action detachment, dispatch in order, detour from the east, scout one thousand meters, seven hundred meters, four hundred meters; avoid encountering combat; go to the advantageous location of the second branch in Central Park, lie in ambush and gather, and wait for secondary orders!</p>
<p>"...Headquarters Number Two; quickly send out the 'Fortune' notice on the second floor, the 'Warning' notice on the third floor, and the 'Friend' notice on the fourth floor; on the fifth floor, restore the 'scattered formation' and prepare the 'cold' command.</p>
<p>"...Headquarters Number Three; quickly arrange the back aisle on the second floor and prepare for service on duty."</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Solitary Mooring Musings</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>To the Editor of Free Talk, forgive my poor talent, as I have long written for the newspaper, ashamed of having no brilliant ideas to offer. Instead, I think of an old horse, halting by a bridge, raising its head and neighing, its ambition stretching a thousand miles. So I imitated its form, writing as the brush moved. The title is: "Solitary Mooring Musings." The words "Solitary Mooring" are based on Chapter 20 of the Tao Te Ching, "I alone am still, showing no sign of activity," as an introduction.</p>
<p>Blake said in his "Auguries of Innocence":</p>
<p>"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour."</p>
<p>These lines of poetry are not just charming, as some might say, because they contain infinite wisdom.</p>
<p>"Before me, I see no ancients; behind me, I see no successors. Thinking of the vastness of heaven and earth, I weep alone in sorrow." This is the work of our great poet Chen Zi'ang at the Tower of Youzhou, filled with compassion and the illusion of history.</p>
<p>This emotion is shared by all humanity, ancient and modern, East and West. We can compare it to Shelley's "To the Moon":</p>
<p>"Art thou pale for weariness / Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth, / Wandering companionless / Among the stars that have a different birth, / And ever-changing, like a joyless eye / That finds no object worth its constancy?"</p>
<p>Ju sent a short letter from the distant Northland, quoting Dickens, "Between people and their souls, there is an immeasurable mystery." How impenetrable a thing is man; the word "pain" is the same for everyone, but the essence of each is incomprehensible to each other.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered, one summer evening three years ago in Chongqing, Ju and I sat at the door to enjoy the cool air, and I groaned two lines of poetry: "Across the river, the lights are bright, but the light does not cross the river."</p>
<p>A cold scene – a long silence between us.</p>
<p>"Look at the lights on the other side, in clusters, naturally becoming many small groups, and yet, the two closest lamps don't know how far apart they are!" Ju said heavily.</p>
<p>The weather was terribly muggy, and the stars twinkled in the sky.</p>
<p>"The stars in the sky are the same. So-called proximity is only felt from the perspective of objective conditions. Aren't people's hearts the same? For example, we..."</p>
<p>I don't remember what else I said that night.</p>
<p>In short, the stars and hearts were in a flurry, and I couldn't tell what was what.</p>
<p>That night, it was extremely late. I don't think we ever spoke much again afterwards. We both immersed ourselves in the sea of stars or the sea of hearts.</p>
<p>When Lin Daiyu was dying in Xiangyun's room, it was Jia Baoyu's wedding night. If dying is the greatest pain in life, then this wedding night would be terribly tragic.</p>
<p>How cursed is fate!</p>
<p>Brother Bao affectionately lifted the veil of hope, only to suddenly find that the bride was not Sister Lin, but Sister Bao? Oh, it's Sister Bao!</p>
<p>When Lin Daiyu was about to leave this world, she uttered her last words: "Baoyu! You are good! You are good!" Then she took her last breath.</p>
<p>"How far apart are the two hearts that are considered closest!"</p>
<h3>Terrible Apprehension</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>Old people have many apprehensions, and therefore old nations like ours have many apprehensions. Apprehension arises from a loss of trust in oneself, and therefore even a child's inauspicious joke can, in the eyes of an old person, destroy his life.</p>
<p>Those who have many apprehensions are bound to be suspicious. To a suspicious person, any irrelevant words can be dragged onto his own head, like the distant relatives in China who claim kinship for thousands of miles. Thus, the speaker suffers.</p>
<p>There is a writer who unfortunately still lives in a large family, which naturally includes men, women, old and young. The wives who have been married into the family come from all directions, and his uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters are engaged in various occupations. In short, a large family is like a small society, and unfortunately, it is a society of suspicion and apprehension.</p>
<p>This writer recently wanted to write a novel. But thinking about it, the story must have a villain; this villain is either a man or a woman; either an adult or a child; either a father or a son; speaking of his or her profession, he or she is either a salaried worker or a boss; either employed or unemployed. Speaking of his or her origin, he or she is either from the south of the Yangtze River or the north of the Yangtze River. No matter how he tries to think outside the box, he can't escape this circle. This villain always seems to be shadowing someone, and shadowing someone will cause protests and disputes.</p>
<p>So for a period of time, this writer only wrote about foreigners, that is, so-called exoticism. But later, his cousin married a foreign woman, and even exoticism became a taboo.</p>
<p>So this writer could only write about turtles and rabbits; until now, his pen is only filled with these things, and he really (to his credit) writes them without any human touch.</p>
<h3>The Ways of Shanghai People</h3>
<p>— Leike</p>
<p>The first sigh of a country person arriving in Shanghai is "It's hard to walk." But what about Shanghai people? Now let me tell you, those who are afraid of difficulties are country people. True Shanghai people are not afraid of the difficulty of walking.</p>
<p>For example, here he comes. Just look at him wearing a newly made uniform – a Melton cloth coat – and you can know that he is seven parts a Shanghai person. You see the sidewalks are crowded, a sea of people, truly "vehicles cannot turn, people cannot be seen." But our Shanghai person is leisurely, looking left and right, as if in the sea of people, he is a free fish. Even on the traffic lane, he can pose with a splayed gait, performing a stroll. Going back and forth in the piles of vendors, he can better show his ability to be resourceful. I say he looks left and right, but most of the time he is not looking at the goods, but at the women in front and behind. However, sometimes you can't tell clearly, because the way he looks at people is exactly the same as the way he looks at goods.</p>
<p>Now look at him waiting for the tram. He is not in a hurry. He buys a pear from a fruit stall on the side of the road. The tram is already coming over there, but he still wants the vendor to peel it for him. So he holds a snowy white pear high. When all living beings are scrambling like sesame seeds squeezing mung beans up and down, this fish has already swam through the sea of people and climbed onto the tram. If the pear juice gets on you, it's your bad luck.</p>
<p>He doesn't want to squeeze into the carriage. The seat next to the tram driver is his best box. He is not a dwarf, standing in this place he can see both inside and outside the car. So he eats the women's tofu while eating the pear, and speaks eloquently, and everyone gives him some face. In an instant, the pear is finished, and he takes out a clean white handkerchief, and after the handkerchief is a toothpick. So he leisurely picks his teeth. Maybe he will just leave the toothpick in his lips like this, or maybe he will change it for a cigarette.</p>
<p>So he takes out his lighter.</p>
<p>Even if the sky falls, Shanghai people are still Shanghai people.</p>
<h3>Strange Events of the World</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In Canton, Ohio, USA, a woman asked for a divorce, complaining that her husband was "unpleasant, irritable, morbid, cold, malicious, jealous, annoying, arrogant, ruthless, stingy, gluttonous, selfish, absent-minded, rude, inconsiderate..."</p>
<p>In Guisborough, England, a policeman named Joseph Wood arrested a man named George Wood, brought him to court, and a man named Robert Wood testified that he stole wood.</p>
<h3>A Gift for a Performer—New Words on Couplets, Eight</h3>
<p>— Listening to Pines</p>
<p>Master Tai Shi Jian had already established his literary reputation early on. The Shen family and my family have been close friends for generations, and we also have deep ties of kinship, so I know him very well. Master Jian has been living in Shanghai for a long time and relies on Vice Minister Shao Xiaocun. Their friendship has lasted for many years, and its beginning was actually due to a couplet. When Master Jian first arrived in Shanghai, Shao Xiaocun had just been appointed as the Taiwan Provincial Governor. He was also in Shanghai and happened to meet at a banquet. The Vice Minister was fond of a performer, named Yinzhu, and intended to take her as a concubine. He said she was as beautiful as a crabapple flower and wanted to write a couplet as a gift to her. The host of the banquet, knowing his intentions well, said to Master Jian, "Vice Minister Shao is about to go to Taiwan and is thinking of finding a talented person to be his secretary. Are you interested?" Master Jian came to Shanghai thinking of finding a teaching position, which the host also knew. So the host praised Master Jian, and the Vice Minister also hinted at asking him to compose this couplet. Master Jian considered both embedding the name Yinzhu and considering the name "crabapple," while also implying the intention to conceal her beauty. The threads were complex and difficult to encompass. Suddenly, he thought of two idioms and used them to complete the couplet: "Silver candles burn high, fearing the flowers will fall asleep deep in the night; Pearl curtains are half-rolled, like a familiar swallow returning." The first line uses a line from Su Dongpo's poem about crabapple blossoms, and the second line borrows the image of a familiar swallow to prophesy her return. It's a natural and ingenious match, the likes of which has never been seen, but it really took a lot of effort. It can truly be said to look easy but be actually difficult. The above couplets are sometimes light and graceful, sometimes complete and solid, sometimes bold and unrestrained. The couplets by the gentleman and the minister excel in simplicity, while this one excels in richness. Moreover, the former came from one's own inspiration, while the latter was ghostwritten for someone else. The difference in difficulty cannot be measured by distance. Vice Minister Shao was overjoyed to read this couplet and asked Master Jian to write it on a gold-lettered couplet scroll. The writing was both elegant and beautiful, and the calligraphy was even more powerful and exquisite. Everyone at the table struck the table and praised it, saying that both the writing and the calligraphy were excellent. I say that Master Jian's life is full of interesting affairs. This couplet is the epitome of his interesting nature. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Reading "Standard"—One of the Book and Newspaper Introductions</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>After seeing the name "Standard," anyone who loves humility cannot help but feel that the host of this weekly magazine is a bit arrogant. After reading its content, one feels that they are not so conceited. The "Editor's Note" states: Standard "itself has no standard, its standard is only the standard of its writers," and its standard will gradually form "after fortunately being able to publish several issues." Once this is said, many people can calm down.</p>
<p>Wei Jinzhi's "A Dying Man" in this inaugural issue is indeed a piece of considerable weight. His heavy, simple pen is used to narrate a heavy and simple story, making the reader feel that every sentence and every word is not frivolous. If this work is taken as the standard, readers welcome the birth of such a pure literary weekly.</p>
<p>Besides this, Zhu Guangqian's translation of "Echo Chamber" is extremely charming, and Yuan Shuibai's translation of the Hughes Poetry Selection is easy to recite. As for Zuo Lin's "Record of Returning Souls," only one-third is published in the first issue. I think I will wait until I see its performance before speaking.</p>
<p>In this era where publishing must lose money, the host is actually able to produce such a pure literary weekly. Even if they are not arrogant, they are bold enough.</p>
<h3>"Adding Flowers to Brocade"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Xiao Zhao and I lived together in an apartment-style hotel in Tokyo. Besides studying, we discussed a person's philosophy of life. He was very smart, and he knew the ways of flattering superiors and blowing for subordinates. In his words, only one or two sentences out of ten were true, and the rest were all lies. He said that people in the world only "add flowers to brocade" and never "provide charcoal in the snow." What is "friendship"? "Money" is friendship. Friendships outside of money are shallow and superficial and do not work for personal prospects. To get the favor and promotion of supervisors, one must spend a lot of money on entertainment. The more money spent, the deeper the supervisor's friendship with you. Once the friendship is deep, any problem can be discussed. When first meeting someone, be sure to elevate your status and not show your true colors or appear poor. Xiao Zhao's words reflected the reality of society, which I understood. But I strongly opposed this way of life. "Those who travel different paths cannot make plans together," so we went our separate ways.</p>
<p>Last spring, due to the high cost of living and the difficulty of maintaining a family, I left the position of quasi-civil servant (not a civil servant but with civil servant treatment) and engaged in business. An outsider doing outsider things, the result was failure.</p>
<p>This cost of living was so oppressive that one could not breathe. Wife crying, children wailing, how to survive? I thought of returning to a teaching position, so I went to find Xiao Zhao. Xiao Zhao was the secretary-general of a certain city's party branch, and at the same time, he was also the principal of a certain municipal middle school and a confidant of the director of the education bureau. With our past friendship, he should be able to help me find a middle school teaching position and would not shirk responsibility.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhao readily agreed. When the schools opened, Xiao Zhao's reply arrived. Upon opening it, it said, "Tried every possible way, but to no avail. Our school's appointment letters have all been issued for a year, and I am very anxious. Please try every possible way to avoid failure," and so on. I understood the reason. I wanted a teaching position, not a principal position, and I also had a brief acquaintance with the director of the bureau. Perhaps I needed "charcoal in the snow." So I looked for department heads, factory directors, etc. The result was always a little hesitant. The result of searching only proved the truth of the saying "adding flowers to brocade."</p>
<h3>Sardines</h3>
<p>— Yu Wangwo Painting</p>
<p>(Made in Shanghai)</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Everyone resumed talking, while rearranging the tables and chairs and stepping up preparations for dinner.</p>
<p>After working all day, everyone's mood also needed to relax! The older child playing the harmonica leaned against the window and played the tune of "The Flag is Waving." Seven young people in Hawaiian shirts surrounded him, singing loudly in chorus. Two or three girls walked into the washroom arm in arm. Even Lu, the cripple who harbored a strong sense of melancholy all year round, temporarily relaxed his eyebrows, which were usually knitted together, took out a Hongyin brand cigarette, faced the window, and smoked leisurely.</p>
<p>After a while, the stairs and the corridor were filled with miscellaneous footsteps, interspersed with the sound of bowls and dishes colliding. The "long-awaited" dinner was finally served. Three tables were set up together in the two connected offices, but there were twenty-five or six people, and it was too crowded to sit down. Anyway, this group of young people never paid attention to etiquette. As soon as they grabbed a bowl and chopsticks, they ate standing up. But today there were too many people, and the result of the grab was that one person lost both chopsticks and a bowl, and that was Lu, the cripple who was used to sighing.</p>
<p>"Don't rush, please go ahead! I'll ask Lao Huang to get me some. Alas! This place is really poor, and there aren't even enough bowls when there are more people!" He dropped the cigarette butt he was sucking on and watched the others eat and drink like hungry tigers without any hurry.</p>
<p>The handyman Lao Huang did not wait for him to speak, and had already gone downstairs to find him a bowl and chopsticks.</p>
<p>Lu, the cripple, approached a table by the window and craned his neck, wanting to see how many dishes there were on the table. Suddenly, a person next to him pointed to the outside of the door with the chopsticks in his hand and winked at him. He understood what it meant. Lao Huang, who went down to find the things, could not possibly be back so quickly. Under the door frame on the left, half a person's body was exposed. It was a woman, facing outwards, so only half of her curly long hair could be seen, half of a faded white-background red-flower cheongsam, and a bare, slender leg, with an old cloth shoe underneath. Obviously, she had been leaning against the door for quite some time, because she did not speak and was facing away, so few people noticed.</p>
<p>Lu, the cripple, frowned and scrutinized her half-figure for a minute or two, and suddenly realized. He shook and swayed as he walked over, wanting to speak, but was stopped by the man with a pockmarked face.</p>
<p>"Is that Miss Jin?" He managed to squeeze out the words, and his pockmarked face turned red.</p>
<p>The woman turned around in horror, opened a pair of dull and glazed eyes, looked around at the people around her, and only after seeing a familiar face did her expression gradually calm down, and she reluctantly squeezed out a meaningless smile.</p>
