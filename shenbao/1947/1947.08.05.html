<h3>我赴日考察團人選　政務會議今可決定　和給問題美蘇各持己見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕政府決定開放對日私人貿易後，赴日考察團即將籌組，定期出發，其人選問題，政院於四日下午三時由秘書長甘乃光召集經，外，財等有關部會首長商討，大致決定，定五日交政務會議決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕全國工協理事長吳蘊初，就赴日商務代表團民問工業界代表問題告記者稱：關於開放對日貿易，民間工業界已組一小組研究會，下詳細研究中，在未有決議以前，赴日代表暫不及考慮，惟政府自決定開放對日貿易後，迄今與民間工業方面尚未有任何接觸，如比次赴日代表政府遴選如有本人時，本人亦不欲參加。</p>
<p>〔合眾社莫莫斯科三日電〕眞理報今日重新向西方各國表示，蘇聯對日本和約，將採强硬政策。該報政論作者萊昂提耶夫撰文稱：在和約之前，四强必須自行集會，擬　　約，並對整個問題，行使充分之否決權。萊氏繼稱：巴黎和會之表決制，必須採納，以阻止美國在表決方面，運用其權力政治，蘇聯應負責堅持此一程序，因蘇聯之參戰，曾迫使日本投降，遠東委員會之權限，嚴格限於佔領政策及一般原則，草擬和約，不能包括在內。尤須憶及者，乃遠東委員會各國之外，尚有甚多國家自認對日本和約，有極大關係，且其參加制訂和約之理由。較遠東委員會若干國家尤爲充分。渠繼謂：對歐洲和約之各種條件，必須由四强堅持，而開羅，雅爾達，波茨坦宣言中之各項決議，必須實踐。該報旋舉出蘇聯何以應與美英中三國有相等發言權之理由：（一）蘇聯擊敗日本最强之精良軍隊——關東軍，（二）蘇聯完全擊敗德國，而加速盟國對日本之勝利，（三）對日本其決定性之最後一擎，係出於蘇聯軍隊（按眞理報並未對此點加以說明），（四）在戰爭期內，蘇聯軍隊使日本最精良部隊自始至終均駐紥於中國東北，而不能出動。（五）蘇聯運守同盟國家之責任，而按照各强國訂定之歷史性協定，按時對日本宣戰。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓三日電〕此間消息靈通人士稱：「眞理報」所言蘇聯對於草擬日本和約，不擬放棄其否決權一事，殆具有試探用意，以確定美國所持立塲是否願意妥協。按美國業已向蘇聯及遠東委員會其他國家闡明其立塲，即所有會員國皆有同等發言權，以三分之二之多數票通過決議，不得行使否決權。消息靈通人士並謂：美國主張在草擬和約時，不許行使否決權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電」據悉：關於蘇聯建議將草擬對日和約事宜移交外長會議處理一節，國務院已決定拒絕。蘇聯如果堅特，則美國政府週內或將採取步驟，單獨進行草擬和約工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕澳洲駐美大使梅金今日宣稱，澳洲堅持自日本工業設備提取賠償，藉以剝奪日本再度製造戰爭之能力。澳洲並將要求對日和約規定盟國寶制並監督日本生活方式，確保其永爲和平國家。盟國監督時期久暫則未說明，但謂：澳洲政府　爲，在日本工業與心理上之作戰潛力未全消滅前，應予繼續管制。</p>

<h3>蘇聯最近新製地圖　擅行改變蒙疆邊界　羅家倫羽明蘇方此舉意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里二日電〕「蘇聯新製地圖中，對外蒙及新疆疆界所作之神秘改變，可供爲了解外蒙侵我新疆整個問題之一主要綫索」。前任職新疆區察使刻爲我駐印大使之羅家倫，今以此語告中央社記者。羅大使稱，渠於新疆負責作科學化勘察工作時，目蘇聯一九二八年繪製及一九四〇年繪製之二地圖中，發覺有不同處，其中尤以新經及外蒙疆界大有出入。以此，渠復對數十種不同地　加以研究。按諸地圖中，俱證明整個阿爾法區為新疆之一部份，及布山則在新疆境內，距外蒙邊境約有二百公里，但在蘇聯一九四〇年繪製之地圖中，則將此廣達八萬八千方公里之地區，劃出新疆省界。羅大使對此事解釋稱，在蘇聯一九二八年繪製地圖時，蘇聯與新疆省主席盛世才，保特友好關係，以當時新疆及外蒙無發生邊界爭執之可能。蓋新疆及外蒙，當時似俱係在蘇聯掌握中也。蘇聯地間上此項疆界之改變，係起於盛世才親蘇態度發生疑問之時。蘇聯經由外蒙要求此新疆境內八萬六千公里之土地，似旨在將整個新疆及中國內部切斷。羅氏復指出，在阿爾泰山及哈密之間，僅有一帶戈　沙漢，哈密及奇台，俱在沙漠邊綫，故若新疆當局經常駐有重兵及文官戰略據點之北塔山，與其他阿爾泰山山隘要地失守，該六城俱將不守。哈密及奇台無險可守，則此石油及黃金蘊藏豐富之新疆之東方門戶，隨時可被封閉而與中國內部隔絕。</p>
<h3>美加兩大使抵濟　今晨公開講演午後返京　司使稱美國援華僅屬方式問題</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南四日電〕美大使司徒雷登，加拿大大使戴維斯，四日上午十一時四十分專機飛抵濟南，省垣各機關首長龐鏡塘等皆赴機傷歡迎，大使等下榻英領事館，當月下半四時半司使應邀對省堰教育界演講，六時美·加旅濟僑民茶會，七時半各界歡宴，預定五月上午應邀對濟各界人十公開講演，訪問此間各首長及學校·工廠·醫院，午後返京。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南四日電〕司徒大使四日午答濟市新聞界問，要點如下：（一）中國目前困難是內在的，特別需要知識靑年及開明自由份子積極領導新的革命建設運動，以建設代破壞，中國人民之努力，可以解決一切問題。（二）美國對中國及戰敗之日本，其態度爲美國希望日本強大，但更希望中國强大，設若日本經濟不能復興，則必爲未來世界和平之危機之根源。（三）中國目前之困難，特別是人民之災難，大使深其同情，但中國之前途，由於歷史悠久，地大物博，人口眾多，祗要人民團結進步，一切是有希望的，不必悲觀失望。（四）美援華非原則問題，乃方式問題，相信此次魏德邁特使調查終了後，必能提供美政府可靠資料，而予中國政府以有效援助。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南四日電〕王兼主席耀武，四日下午四時由泰安指揮所返濟，當晚與司徒雷登，戴維斯兩大使晤談頗久，賓主歡洽。</p>

<h3>綏境各旗安定　奇俊峯與石王合葬</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏三日電〕綏保安師長鄂友三，日前赴百靈廟視察防務，其參謀長趙淑普三日由綏北抵省，據稱：百靈廟距外蒙三百華里，除外蒙人民越境追趕彼等之牛羊外，尚未發現外傳之飛機，汽車，騎兵。今年綏北水草豐富，達爾罕旗人心安定，四子王旗保安隊與國軍並肩防堵蒙匪竄人綏境。又茂明安旗女王額仁欽達賴，三日晨由包晋省，東北旗女王巴雲英刻在包頭寓居，西公旗女王奇俊峯及其幼十屍體已盛棺與石王合葬，該旗仕官一面聽候省府處理善後，一面請武當召喇嘛定期超渡亡魂，郝猶龍部在包頭五原間護路，汽車照常通行。</p>

<h3>塘沽新港問題　魏德邁使團在津將有所討論</h3>
<p>〔合眾社天津四日電〕魏德邁將軍四日晨自北平飛此後，則與中國軍政領袖及美國商業領袖等會談，並定於五日接見「塘沽新港建築局」局長。中國半官方坦白表示，希望美國能協助完成此中國之唯一之人工港口，按塘沽新港乃在戰爭緊張時期中由日本人秘密建築者，在戰爭結束時已完成一半。據悉：因保守秘密之故，許多築港華工被日人殺死。在戰事結束後，才知有該港存在。半官方面稱：新港口媲美靑島之海軍基地，築成後可加緊對共黨自大連至華北運輪之控制，並可增進華南調兵至東北戰區之便利。</p>
<p>在商業上言，新港築成後，最大輸船均可直達天津，目前三千噸以上之船隻，祇能在塘沽口外拋錨。</p>
<p>據計劃，該港堤岸長達十七公里，爲世界最長之堤岸。一九四五年社魯門　使洛克曾考察新港，渠希望美國能協助中國完成此港。中國官員稱：中國本身缺乏基金及有經騐之工程師，不能單獨完成此港。魏德邁是否將建議美國加以協助，殊成問題。</p>
<p>第一，天津爲戰區，兩月前曾受共軍之威脅。秋天如共軍在東北發動攻勢，天津將受嚴重之成脅。</p>
<p>第二，目前在整個貿易停頓時期，改善天津港口並無多大商業上之意義，除非魏德邁能使美國對中國之商業，有新的政策。</p>
<p>然在軍事方面，因談港可作軍港，故目前即有重大之意義。日本會派遣七百名按術人員以及嚴密監視下之數千華工趕築三年，而天津市民當時對之亳無所知。美機亦從未轟炸該地。日本戰爭工業所需之　及鐵礦即經此運回日本。日本海軍部並計劃，如美國侵入日本時，日本海軍即以此與靑島兩港控制華北海面。</p>

<h3>社論　我國的對外貿易問題</h3>
<p>自抗戰勝利，政府實施貿易管制政策以來，國內外人士咸集中注視於所謂『歧視待過』和『豪門資本』的諸種形相·魏德邁將軍最近來滬，上海美商，據傳對於以上兩點，曾有所質難。。正在這個時候，南京的中央日報，却發表了關於『孚中』及『揚子』等『豪門資本』的調查報告，數字龐大，舉國震驚。本報既曾著論，促謂冷靜思考，詳盡調查，以爲前項報道，漏列了小數點，以誤傳誤，於是社會上又爲『豪門資本』起轟了。實則『豪門資本』的勢力，竟非如外傳想像之大，因爲他們僅得外匯總額百分之〇·八七，遝不及百分之一：則所爲『豪』，也實在可憐了。中央日報其後又曾聲明錯誤，加以更正；而同時，政府當局又於一日發表了孚中揚子等公司的進口及結匯情形，證實了此兩公司共結外匯的總數，約占中央銀行同時期內所售外匯總額萬分之三十八——其中且包括有該公司等之出口結匪。『豪門資本』的眞相，於以大白於天下。一般外人士，目今既集中注視於我國的貿易狀况，茲願約略於此有所論列。</p>
<p>首先，我們要提出就目前中國的局勢，政府實不得不實施貿易管制；對我國的輪入，加以管理。對中國當前的局勢，我們義曾有所指陳，其中關於　濟局勢，曾說：『現在中國所遭遇到的經濟危難，原與中國政治局勢的演變，具着不可分離的關係。共匪的存在，使中國經濟的澈底改革，包括幣制的澈底改革，成爲一什不可能的事。…但政府在它的權力以內，自應儘可能的來挽救目前的經濟頹勢，它不能放棄這責任。這是爲此，所以我們看見有種種經濟上的管制——包括輸出入的管制在內。既然有了管制，對於自由於是也就有了限制……。』現在一般所認爲的『歧視待遇』，在實質上，實多由於『貿易自由』受了限制而起。中國政府的政策，既表示歡迎外資，是決不會對中外商人有所歧視的。我們沒有歧視的立法，所以在中國的對外貿易上，根本談不到所謂歧視。這是我們所應該指出的一點。</p>
<p>因爲有了管制，於是就有了機關，這是就產生了人事因素的問題。公文輾轉的稽延，感情的衝動偏好，這些無疑地可能予人以刺戟；但這不是法的問題，不是政策的問題。這種現象在世界各地都可能發生，本不獨見於中國。中國政府並不以爲現行的種種管制辦法，極無修改的餘地，只要理由充分，我們深信中國政府是準備隨時接受建議，來將它們予以修正的。至於手續的稽延繁複，以及庶吏的奉公精神，間或不免欠缺，政府也隨時在加以注意，設法改善·目前中國是處在一個非常時期，我們應抱着極大的忍耐。</p>
<p>我們於此又不得不指出的是目前的整個世界，還沒有回復到寗靜的狀態，世界貿易本還沒有回復到正常，我們的對外貿易，在此情勢之下，自亦不能例外。必整個世界回復安寗，然後世界貿易繼能入於常軌。從事於貿易的人不應該將他們的眼光完全放在金元上，應該放在一個較遠的角度。我們要明瞭爲什麼世界迄未回復安寗，先將這一個大問題解決，然後世界商務貿易關係纔能正常發展。同樣，從事中國商務貿易的人要明瞭，爲什麼中國迄未回復安寗，等到這一問題解決了以後，然後中國的對外貿易纔會有正常的發展。</p>
<h3>司法部發言人談　改良監獄情形　監犯作業人數達十四萬餘</h3>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕記者四日就美憲兵隊長鮑華所稱，該案犯人之最高處刑，將爲徒刑五年至十年一點，詢諸某法學家，承告鮑華此語，乃在兩項假定之後所爲，其一為犯人雖爲憲兵，然犯罪時未值班，不能以憲兵論；其二爲犯人背於醉後作成犯罪行爲，兩項中第一項尤爲重要，未值班是否影響其憲兵身份，大可研究，如第一項假定不能成立，第二項假定徒足加重其罪名，吾人希望美軍方愼重處理此事，勿爲求减輕罪兵過失，而曲解其本國法律，至此案雖依「處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例」由美軍方處理，但我方觀審人員，於必要時可保留意見，而循外交途徑提出交涉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：國務院發言人稱，美國仍未向印尼提出調停荷印爭端之建議。此後是否直接向印尼提出，尚未決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬達維亞四日電〕印尼共和和今日頒布停戰令，並要求聯合國安全理事會指定公斷委員會，監督執行雙方停戰事宜，是為聯合國機構成立以來對於爭取和平之初次大勝利。此項停戰令係由日惹電台於今日下午一時（上海時間下午十時）播發，索卡諾總統今日午後將以印尼軍總司令身份發表廣播演說。荷方停戰令昨已宣布，定今日午夜起生效。據荷蘭發言人稱，大部份荷軍早經停止前進，，三寶壠方面今日幾無活動。</p>

<p>〔路透社孟買四日電〕印尼前總理沙利已於今日自孟買啟程赴級的成功湖，沙氏在機塲吿記者稱：此去紐約係探知安理會能有何種作爲。若聯合國機構允許荷人佔有兩週來所佔領之土地，則僅事停戰，反於荷方有利，此舉不足以解決印尼問題，亦非印尼所願。荷人必須退至原來防區，談判始能開始。夏氏於三四日內可望坻紐約。</p>

<h3>印尼仇視僑胞　實中日人遺毒</h3>
<p>〔中央肚巴達雜亞四日電〕茲綜合印尼軍隊與羣衆對華僑財產作大規模刧掠與焚燒之原因如下：（一）妒嫉華僑根深蒂固之經濟勢力，因印尼靑年在戰時巳中日本人宣傳之毒；（二）印尼資源雖富，而民衆極貧，無知無識不辨是非，在擾亂之際，彼等總信可焚刧而不致受罰；（三）華僑對印尼獨立運動，表示不熱烈之同情，因華僑在荷印政治爭執中，處境甚雌，討好一方，則必致開罪另一方；（四）大多數印尼靑年之參加軍隊，實爲維持生計，初非計及國家民族之利益，彼等深悉參加任何作戰團體，無論備有武器或竹製戈矛，均可度日；（五）印尼官員，無維持治安之能力，尤以外沿區域爲最；（六）印尼官員包括警察在內，均無負責心，一旦有事發生官員警察，均捲蓋而逃；（七）一般生活水準之低落，非法之事，因而導致，除去少數可領薪俸外，其他作戰部隊，均須自己沒法開支。</p>
<h3>僑胞自衛　組織志願保安隊</h3>

<h3>邱吉爾發表演說　承認英國經濟危機嚴重　英政府或將放棄社會主義實驗</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕倫敦多數報紙今日揣測，工黨政府鑒於經濟危機日亟，或須將尙朱實施之主要工業國有法案，展期實行或竟予放棄。多數英人正在週杪休假，主管當局則忙於擬訂經濟危機緊急措施方案，對於報載各節，無暇發表意見。因此，工黨政府社會主義政策之前途究竟如何，尙爲一時局之謎。</p>
<p>素以消息靈通見稱之「倫敦觀祭報」載稱，鋼鐵業國有法案原擬於國會十月間復會後提付討論，現似將作罷。此一問題，內閣會於上星期間加以討論，雖尙未有最後決定，但閣員方面竭力以爲此非其時。惟鋼鐵煤氣電力等業國有計劃停止實行，亦將引起大部份贊助者之嚴厲批評，此輩贊助者均以爲英國經濟如欲一勞永逸置於堅强基礎，則社會主義必須迅速實行。保守黨對於社會主義實騐之自動放棄，自所樂聞，該黨對於鋼鐵國有計劃，曾全力加以反對。</p>
<h3>倫敦即將舉行　英伊修約談判</h3>

<h3>美國陸海空軍統一指揮　福萊斯特草擬詳細計劃　一旦有事即能發揮更大力量</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕據軍人方面消息：美國防部長福萊斯特現正考慮一項計劃，　武裝力量全部加以改組，以便將美國大陸上之陸海空軍之指抓統一。此項計劃山聯合參謀部長加以草成。該計劃規定設立一最高統帥，附有陸海空軍將官所組成之參謀部，直接受聯合參謀部長之指揮。而聯合參謀部長則將指揮美國之邊境防衛事宜。</p>
<p>該計劃又規定將全國劃成主要軍略區，每一區皆設有一總司令，統轄所有該區之陸海空三軍，此一司令擔負實際作戰策略，而不負給養及軍事行政等問題。據軍事當局相信，福萊斯特可經由行政當局之命令而不需國會之通過，即可實施此項計劃。實際上在海外，早有類似之計劃存在，舉例言之，麥克阿瑟在遠東指揮一切陸海空三軍，克萊格少將則指揮阿拉斯加之三軍是也。在此項組織下，在戰略上居重要之空軍司令，以原子武器予敵國以長距離之打擎，或將仍保持自成爲系統之軍事力量。在美國大陸上，每一戰區司令皆對國防之統一計劃負責，一旦發生緊急，並負責指揮作戰。該計劃每一部門之服役日常行政活動，並不改變，但其優點則爲陸海空軍能對企圖攻美之敵軍，聯合予以打擊。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京四日電〕遠東軍事法庭已於四日恢復審判工作，並就日本發動太平洋戰事部分，由被告癖護律師作共同辯護提證工作。首由高橋律師辯護稱：「太平洋戰爭爲日本之自衛手段，並非侵略戰爭，故所有被吿，均屬於從事自衛鬥爭者」。其列舉之理由更屬荒誕不經，（一）日本之工業經濟應人民需要而發達，故至最後階段，乃將其必需部分轉變爲戰爭之用；（二）日本人口增加，土地不足，其結果惟有謀求工業化，而由於資源貧乏，自必依存外國貿易，但一九三一年以來，由各國之高率關稅及輸入限制　，阻止本之貿易，晶本經濟受此壓迫，故有一九四一年十二月八日之猛然反擊；（三）歐美諸國一面對日推進經濟包團，他方積極準備對日戰爭，而在日本並無展開侵略戰爭之陸海軍共同謀議之事實，陸海軍當時之見解，思想，均屬對立。</p>

<h3>二百餘商家　控告一地痞　戲劇性八大罪狀　宣司令怒令澈查</h3>
<p>舊法租界英士路，黃陂路，西門路，興業路等十一條馬路全體商民二百餘家，昨日具狀警備司令部，控告住於望志路一百十一號之地痞楊步友，並列舉「戲劇性」之八大罪狀。宣司令接閱後大爲震怒，手令稽查處負責澈查。華京社記者茲節錄其八大罪狀原文如後；舊法租界無業遊民最多，相習成風，一時雖於浦淸。此輩不耕而食，不織而衣，恒以敲詐偸竊爲能事，直接受害者，指不勝屈。流氓領袖爲楊步友，渠在戰前，在淮陰專員公署曾吃匪案官司，淪陷期又在「汪記政府」坐牢二年半，實屬罪大惡極，殺不容赦。其罪狀產產大者，計有（一）</p>
<p>小放牛：楊步友收小偸無賴門徒約百餘人，自組小黃半黨，專門在蘇州河上帮推三輪車，人力車，向客張索，每晚拆賬，坐地分贓，孩無收人，亦由楊臨時借藝。其黨又一部份專門出人遊戲傷，扒竊錢物，三天拆賬，屆時大盞喝酒，大塊吃肉，完全梁山泊作風。（二）</p>
<p>喜臨門：林森賂以南，徐家匯以北，凡各商店開張時，照例有一班類似乞丐前往賀喜，同時强討硬紫，否則盤踞滋擾，不達目的不止。舊法租界聞分七糾，楊步友之地盤則在西門，崇德，英士，黃坡，順昌各路。境內新店開市必由伊一手包辦，派人開支，最多者有七百萬。又新店所懸頭牌軟硬　，其署名爲楊步友，即其包辦明證，蓋惜藉以嚇退餘子。（三）</p>
<p>討荊州：新開張之商號，楊步友除包辦開銷外，復討索貨物，如百貨佔則取其牙刷，水瓶，綢緞局則取其花呢，橫羅。其餘類推。試觀楊步友家器具陳設各物，追本銷源，無非白拿，所謂「硬取荆州」，絕不顧人血本。（四）</p>
<p>捉放曹：南市一帶下層社會，凡有口角鬥戰，多請楊出面肩扛，先惠車馬費若干，楊即着人捉對方至茶樓酒肆大駡一頓，視金錢之多寡，定理由之曲直，待任何一方先決條件備妥，則先回家，無錢者必看押一二日，需塡滿慾盤，而後始放。（五）</p>
<p>羣英會：標會恐風已成過去，蓋每會必散，人多望而却步，楊則異想天開，改請助會十萬或廿萬，擇期大吃一頓，各付會款，點者抽籤還本，分期復原，弱者肉饅打狗，有去無來，一羣竄桶，煞是可憐。（六）</p>
<p>銅網陣：飛帖拉樂，久於例禁，一般流氓，大都歛跡，而楊則悍然不顧，每年最少兩次，或陰壽，或陽壽，挨店散發紅巾，有三萬元，有五萬元，儘量撈摸臭銅。本年四月十四，舉行過一次，凈得聞有一兩千萬元，如此光棍發帖，實所罕見。（七）</p>
<p>粉粧樓：楊兼營毒品，去年年底被人吿發，楊聞風遠颺，由其住所望志路一一一號樓上搜出白粉十九小包，至今未敢向地院投案。（八）</p>
<p>斬經堂：楊步友結髮王氏，原籍淮安結婚三年，毫無情感。其岳父假仁恨義，有王莽作風，不識其婿行爲，欲控之於官。楊　先下毒手，竟殺其妾，亡命來滬，又娶王氏。前年勝利之際，靑年團捉拿流氓，楊逃而妻潛出，至今未歸，楊則藉案陷害仇人魯鵬飛，使魯家敗人亡，現楊又姘某漢奸下堂妾，隱匿大批偽產，其胆大至此。</p>

<h3>一位光榮的老理髪師　鏡畔話滄桑　多少黨國元老曾由他整容</h3>
<p>為革命同志剪辮開始　度剃刀生涯三十六年</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕時間是一股殘酷的浪潮，歷史永遠在它的巨浪裏翻騰起伏。浪潮起伏中固然多的是洪濤，但是也有泡沫　。珍重地掇拾一些泡沫，也許是有裨於將來歷史記錄的吧！我們懷着這樣的心情去訪問了一位歷經蒼桑的人物，這位是度過三十六年剃刀生涯的理髮師。（見附圖·本報攝）</p>
<p>在銀行公會的五樓，我們會到了這位理髮師，他叫羅伯禮，廣東順德人，今年五十二歲。當他第一句話說：「我十八歲就在馬尼剌加入了同盟會」的時候，使我午感到意外的驚奇，原來他還是個革命的前輩！他的剃刀生涯開始在宣統元年，因爲那時候他有一個專門的任務，是替革命同志剪辮子，於是從菲島到香港而再到上海，他便正式「在一樂也」拿起了剃刀而爲理髮師了。</p>
<p>中山先生理髪　不超過十分鐘</p>
<p>「一樂也」當時在大新公司的底層隔璧，是全滬唯一最其規模的理髮店。因有他有過去的那一段淵源，所以中山先生到滬時，理髮的職務總是山他一手包辦。中山先生那時寓慕利多亞路（現在復興公園近傍的一條馬路）十四號，家裏陳設極其簡單，同住的人祗有兩個副官和胡漢民先生。由於國事忙碌，理髮祇每月兩次，每次從未超過十分鐘。他說中山先生對修飾非常簡單，髮硬而從不數油，修面時常殷股垂注上海工會的組織情况，叮囑他必光以身作則，負責把理髮工魯壽組統一，　這六家繳納會費，以奠定革命工作的底層隊礎。理髮完畢，中山先生命副官付費二元，並且對他說：「任何　業在革命工作的前而是一律平等的」。</p>
<p>鐵老講究修面　郭大使愛髹髪</p>
<p>民國十年前後，國事混沌。軍閥　據，許多黨國要人都留居在滬籌劃。吳鐵城·郭泰祺·葉楚億·張繼·當乘人力車到「一樂也」理髮。鐵老最講究修面，修好後一定要他再施電氣磨面剪髮要慢條斯理。在剪刀軋軋聲中，鐵老總是閉目不語，靜靜地欣賞這刀光皂影下的片刻熨貼與溫存。郭大使年少翩翩，對修飾自然也特別注意。當他用整潔的衣着挺俊地端坐在「安樂椅」上時，羅伯禮便小心翼翼的爲他淺撫輕裝，熟練而又習慣地爲他保護鬢角上的兩堆柔髮。因爲這是大使最愛惜的一塊禁地，自耳邊以上，不能露白。當年照片上的郭大使，不正是有一蓬外包內合光可鑑人的秀髪的嗎？這就是二十餘年前羅伯禮的一手得意的傑作！</p>
<p>那時候汪精衡·店少川·陳介·也都是羅伯禮的經常顧顧客。在逆理髮，與衆不同，他要在開剪前後對自己的整個頭面部的美觀先作一比較，如果他認爲理髪後並無增益於他原來那副「小生」姿色，那麼小賬至多二角小洋。他那搔首弄姿的心理，常會使他把金錢和面子放在等量的前提上去對付一切。這就與郭大使的爲人完全不同了，　管大使听要求的也是愛美，但他並不以金錢支持自己的好惡和愛憎。他每次都是規律地付費：理髮四角修面二角，不給小賬。</p>
<p>宋子文催聲快　兩三分鐘畢事</p>
<p>民國二十年前後繼伯禮替宋十文在祁齊路公館內理髪的時候，他最擔心的是他操剪速度不能符合宋氏突如共來的要求，朱氏要催一聲「快！」，兩三分鐘內一定要完全畢事，不要採油，不要整理，，付賬是歷久不變，大洋五元，有時候宋夫人後頸的鬢脚也要他修剃的，不過那是不常有的事。</p>
<p>孔祥熙博士在理髮時所廣現出來寬厚和誠篤，是使羅伯禮的記憶裏始終覺得感激的。他每次在理好髪後，簽字付賬然後就緩靜而又沉着的向腰向一隻「錢包」中去摸索，口裏不住向羅伯禮謙華的說：「我還沒有給你酒錢啦！」結果大洋四角就在羅伯禮的半推半就之下摸出來了。羅伯禮說：「老派的人物雖然動作不合時宜，不夠亮，但是他們的心地都是很好的」。</p>
<p>英雄忽而害羞　蔡廷錯變常客</p>
<p>最使人感到興趣的是蔡廷　將軍。他的理髮本來是採取散兵綫戰略、沒有固定塲所，隨時隨地坐下來剪掉頭髮就算了的。後來不右怎的這位衝鋒陷陣的英雄忽然害羞起來了，覺得在外面店裏理髮旁邊圍着許多看客、，把他當成品頭評足的目標，使他週身侷促不安。那時候「一業也」早己閉歇，羅伯禮已轉移到現在銀行公會裏來了，所以蔡將軍經人介紹，便委托羅伯禮經常在會中一間小室裏負起了整容的任務。</p>
<p>羅伯禮還附帶的吿訴記者說，。從前「一樂也」有一種特製的「刷頭器」，形式如現在燙髪用的圓盤，吊在半空，下面略呈筒狀，專門用以代替肥皂來洗磨頭部使之淸潔的，要人們都曾經很欣然地把頭鎭進這圓筒內享受過抓刷滌刮的舒適。這部「刷頭器」後來被店主施德之的後人常廢鐵拆賣了，到現在爲止上海還沒有出現過第二具。他說來非常感慨。好像在豪華的回億中，也有無限蒼凉。</p>
<p>王曉籟愛談京戲　董顯光三週一臨</p>
<p>現在在銀行公會中，經常屬於羅伯禮的顧客，有李馥蓀，張嘉璈，貝淞蓀，王曉籟，董顯光等人。王曉籟身體健旺髪髯繞腮，在修面的時候常和羅伯禮傾談他對京戲的愛好。羅伯禮用手勢擬了一個王氏的面部輪述說：「好功架，眞是典型的鉅錘大面」！</p>
<p>董顯光三星期來滬一次，到上海必來理髮。他在「安樂椅」上半臥斜倚之際，總喜允和羅伯禮閒話家常，娓娓唧唧，情况大概是異常親切而溫靂的。可惜錯過一日，在記者訪問的前夕，董氏恰在鋻容，聽說他臨行時付小賬五千元，並曾與羅伯禮握手道別。</p>
<p>天氣太熟了，我午也就和他握手道別。他末了說：『從前在「一樂也」是五十元月薪，現在他在公會裏是二百萬一月。從前理髮祇須二角，現在郤要一萬多了』！看着他那微喟的背影，這卅六年的剃刀生涯是在吿訴我們大家怎樣渡過了一個苦難的時代！　為革命同志剪辮開始　度剃刀生涯三十六年</p>
<h3>費時年餘耗資逾五億　本市最大喞水站落成　每分鐘可抽水六萬加侖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工務局於昨日下午三時，招待本市新聞界前往日暉港，參觀最近甫吿完工之巨型閘　及唧水站。上項工程，費時逾年，耗資五億六千萬，乃本市最大之唧水站，其目的在解救舊法租界西區之積水。按本市舊法租界之溝渠系統，除東部直接出口於黃浦江外，大部份溝管，皆洩水於其南邊之盤嘉浜，經“暉港而出黃浦江，故在日軍港北端與　閘　及　站後，即可控制水流。據　　工程師昨日報吿。壩之功用，在阻止高潮倒灌，閘門之功用，在便利低潮時間雨水宣宣洩，唧站之功用，在抽吸監嘉浜內之暴雨水，排洩於日暉港中，則今後潮水之漲落，對舊法租界區可無影響，積水當可改善。</p>
<p>記者往觀時，唧機正開足馬力，將鋻家浜之臭水，抽入日暉港中，但見漩渦時現，速度甚快。該站計有七十匹馬力之馬達二座，八十五匹之馬力一座，每分鐘打水共達六萬加侖。據趙局長稱：估計半天工夫，可將肇家浜全部水量抽完云。</p>

<h3>院轄西安市　邁開第一步</h3>
<p>〔本報西安訊〕改爲院轄市的西安市政府，已於今日（一日）正式成立了。第一任市長王友直，是昨天才卸任的陝省敎廳長。今天下午，他在第一次記者招待會中，以堅定的語氣宣述其遠驅的施政目標：「院辖西安市，應建設爲一個合乎現代標準的文化都市，作爲西北文化活動的中心。—在他另一篇書面談話中，又以沉重的語訓吿我六十萬市民：「西安雖係周秦漢唐之故都，中國文化之搖籃，惟至近代，似已不勝文物衰頹之痛。……」</p>
<p>照新市長的解釋，西安此次由省轄市升格爲院轄市，其意義在乎强訓西安對西北的國防，政治，經濟，文化……諸範　的重要性。</p>
<p>但朝向這目標第一步的「開步走」就遭遇到困難。因為在這次四個升格不過六十萬；稅收亦最少，每月不足十億元。以這樣的人力財力，當然不能支持不個龐大的施政機構，也不易單憑地方力量以實現規模較大的建設計劃。這是現實問題，我們可以用數字來視明它。</p>
<p>爲了節省政費，新市府編制可能採用較簡的方案，市府內僅設六局，如此，每月政費預算十七億元，比諸設八局的方案預算爲廿九億元，要工　節百分之四十。何去何從，短期內即可決定。目前市府收入每月十億元，除百分之卅歸中央外，百分之七十撥歸地方，雖採較　的編制，每月經費尚欠八九億左右。</p>
<p>新市府開辦費一百億元，南京方面認爲稍多。確實的補助數額，尙在審核中。建設費預算共一千二百億元，內分上水，下水，馬路工程三項，各四十億，南京方面正與其他三個院辖市建設費併案審核中</p>

<h3>西安自來水工程　新市府決即動工</h3>
<p>西安目前急待興建的有自來水工程，若中央補助金不足用，即使有一百億元，新市府亦已決定立即初步開工，其餘擬招民間資本，改作官商合辦或官督商辦。</p>
<p>市中心四條十字馬路擬改爲洋灰路，以求一勞永逸，而實際上反可省下一第修路費。</p>
<p>下水道和公厠亦擬逐步建築，以提高公共衛生。此外，加强戶籍登記，健全人民社國……這都是新市長胸中的藍晒圖</p>
<p>「市民不希萬的事，我們不做；我們要做市民希望的事。」這句話，新市長今天在好幾僩集會塲合中反覆的强調的告訴了六十萬市民。</p>
<h3>市府用一文錢　收一文錢實效</h3>
<p>自從發表西安改爲院轄市以來，六十萬市民切身的關心，與其說在乎美麗遠景的憧憬，母寗說担心目前與今沒的負担是否加重。關於這一點，新市長分兩方面來說明：「今後決不增加市民之額外負祖，但市民有膺承應有負祖之義務。」他認爲市民之分担市政費係義務，且目前西安市民之負担，比較他縣之縣民，還輕得多，他希望用整理稅源，肅淸稅收流弊，以增加市府的收入，同時，力求支出有實効，用一文錢，看出一文錢的効果。（記者李馳，八，一）</p>

<h3>黑石關又演一慘劇　打跑船夫軍人自行開船　猛撞橋樁船身突告破裂　救活廿八人淹死卅一人斷橋難修復</h3>
<p>〔本報開封訊〕豫西連日大雨，隴海路黑石關洛河大漲，該處大橋，已於廿七日被水冲壞。該路東西各次列車，均於橋頭停止，另用木船擺渡旅客，以維交通，詎料廿八日黑石關竟發生覆船慘劇，淹斃老弱婦孺三十一人，經救活者二十八人，詳情探誌如下：</p>
<p>當日該渡口共備木船九隻，該肇事船係由西岸東渡，最後之一隻，（隴海三次票車旅客）時有某部軍人石裕鈁·楊超華等，因與另一部份軍人，互相擔渡，立逼開船，船主見船上人數過多，超過重量，兼以水勢汹湧，乃吿以危險，不敢開船，石楊二人不惟不聽，反將船夫打跑，路局車務，工務段長，站長，監工護警等，向前勸阻，曉以利害，石楊二人堅持不聽，乃自行起錨開船。</p>
<p>此時章有另一壑船趕到，遂移往該船旅客約半數以上，詎石楊二人不諸水性，船至河心，因水勢極猛，無法駕駛，束手無策，船隨急流而下，‘流至黑石關大橋，評然一聲，撞於大橋橋橋上，木船立即破碎，所有乘客，盡遭滅頂，橋頭路警，見狀急教，經救活渚二十八人，其中除軍人外，多為老弱婦孺，有一歲至三歲之兒童數人，最後又撈出老嫗及十餘歲女孩各一具，行李十五件，是役共計被難者三十一人，亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>路方為安慰被害旅客，除對死者備棺裝殮候領，並各贈洋十萬元交親屬代領外，其教活者每人供給食需一日，另贈旅費五各萬元，同時將肇禍人右裕鈁·楊超華二人，押送鄭州稽查處法辦。</p>
<p>記者詢及路局負責人橋工情形，據稱：現在水勢過大，水位已至九九·七五公尺以上，短期尙難興修，俟水位落至九二·〇〇公尺以下時，始能開工。在此未修期間，仍須以木船擺渡。（八·一）</p>

<h3>棉紗新議價發表</h3>
<p>廿支紗每件九八〇萬元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉紗新議價，昨晨由紡調會正式公吿。計廿支紗每件爲九八〇萬元，較上月一日議價，已增一百萬元。其他各支紗，經公吿議價者，有十支紗六八二萬元，十六支紗八六二萬元，卅二支紗一三〇〇萬元，四十二支紗一五〇〇萬元。所有上述議價，據紡調會公吿稱：均係廠盤最高售價。紗商得照廠盤，另加利潤百分之五。零售價格，另加百分之十。至以上未列之各支別紗，及各種商標脾號之棉紗，應觀依商塲習慣，比照定價，總以同支別棉紗，不超過以上議定最高售價爲限，如運嚴懲。</p>
<p>據悉：經部昨晨曾與紡調會一度電話聯絡，經部之意，將廿支紗新議價，核定爲九六〇萬。後對滬廠方所提九八〇萬元之議價，終勉予照准。惟囑國民營紗廠，至少須各提供各支棉紗一千五百件，於昨日配售，俾免紗市因新議價實施伊始，發生波動。惟昨日除中國紡建公司開出各支紗一千五百件，民營申新紗廠開出各支紗約六百件外，此外各廠，均未開出。</p>
<p>據某民營廠首腦表示意見，昨日紡調會所公告各支紗價格，細支紗推算價格之比例，全未遵照前紡管會原定比例推算，故均不足比例數，各廠遂多踟躕未開。惟聞各廠有定今日續開之說。各民營廠所攤之開紗額，計申新六百件，永紗三百件，新裕二百件，統益，中紡，崇新，保豐，安達，榮豐，信和各一百件。</p>
<p>又據另一方面談稱：昨日議價，係上週六議價小組會決定。細支紗議價，如照原定比例推算，將超過目前之市價。而紡調會議價，本定以不超過市價爲原則。故臨時察酌市况，而另議較市稍低之價格。再則近來市塲對細支紗納胃甚小，外帮銷路不暢，故市價疲軟。</p>
<p>又上週六議價小組會開會時，會決議組織各廠開紗稽查團，由紡調會高秉泰，紡建公司張方佐，民營廠張文潛三人組織之。職責在赴各廠稽查開紗情形，開紗數額及價格等情。昨日本擬出發稽查，後以民營廠棉紗有待今日續開之說，遂臨時改期今日，再赴各廠稽查。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紡調會議價小組會，將於今日下午四時，再度舉行會議，對議價將有所討論。今後每週二四六議價，一三五掛牌售紗。</p>
<h3>棉紗實銷清淡</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗布况，初開微　秀色，廠家略有零星採辦，但實需依然不暢，迨至收市，申新廠有紗開出，紡建公司開紗配價又見提高，掛牌廿支天女提高至九百八十萬元，四二支立馬一千六百六十萬元，做開極爲平淡。雖有議價提高之舉，而買方並不重視，市氣反呈平疲。</p>
<p>結果細紗四二支藍鳳比週六回漲十萬，爲一千七百二十五萬元。水月好五萬，爲一千七百十五萬元。二十支輕雙馬則挫跌五萬元，爲一千零八十五萬。其餘天女人鐘雙地球及十六支光明紅蜂奔騰，十支　子軍金寳星細紗四十支三十二支等各紗，一致下挫，自五萬至十五萬元不等。</p>
<h3>棉布奄無生氣</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初以紡建公司遵照紡調會議決，提高紗價，業中人心思堅昂，龍頭細亦布會做高至四十三萬八千元，嗣因客帮殊少活動，進意懈怠。本街店莊亦乏進取，最後十二磅籠頭細布市價，比週六回挫三千元，爲四十三萬二千元，五顧藍鷄彩球等各細布，亦挫二三千至六七千元不一，其餘白坯布及嗶嘰色布士林布等，市均平軟。</p>
<p>棉市平穩</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因紗廠有吸，脚地尙穩，價無榮辱，惟做開仍屬不多。L.S.S送廠價二二〇萬，火機一七二萬萬五千，棧交價計雪費二一二萬，二二〇萬至二二五萬，沙市一九六萬五千，漢口細絨一九六萬至二〇〇萬，冲通州一入九萬五千，火　一七二萬，屬浦籽花三三萬五千。</p>
<h3>呢羢銷路略起</h3>
<p>旬日以來，毛織品値炎暑空檔，兼受種種環境關係，如香港呢羢嗶噦由漢口帶至南京上海者顯夥，造成貨價明平購疲，實地成交淸淡異常。昨棋盤街及長樂茶會上，大衣呢及元直貢呢數　，則有向榮之象，因客帮銷路相繼已起，渝蓉帮　有搜辦，西安長沙帮亦有索樣問津者，以致其他毛織物品之趨熱亦被帶挺矣。</p>
<h3>多方買意濃厚　華股人心堅俏</h3>
<p>華股昨在銀根鬆濫中，人心依然堅俏，多方施展做手，上塲時買意盎然，均見高價。中絲開出即漲達限度，永紗漲起一成，爲近來所罕見。多頭紛紛案勢出籠，中途易於回落，但臨收時買戶仍有加碼，平後復堅，麗安一度抬至漲停板，（未獲成交），半天間以信和火柴較爲堅穩，良以前者增資在濃，後者則贈股優厚也。</p>
<p>晨開承上週六餘勢而均見高，中絲由一一七號一四二號掛漲停，遞永紗自二五二元開後，七三號四號六〇號二三一號八五號均進，升至二五六元。銀行帮若二〇七號四五號賣出，多方若二三五號一五四號一七九號二二三號七六號亦售，二三二號二二四號空方加碼，且由九七號二一八號供給現永紗，跌至即交二四五元，及遞交二四七元。二三一號趁低進現永紗，九四號一五五號一八五號八五號亦納，升至二五二元。一五四號一八六號七六號一五七號二三五號二三二號二〇七號仍有供售，九七號再賣現永紗，而回小至二四三元，及二四五元。美亞由一一七號供給，亦急切回低至四二八元及四三三元。</p>
<p>盤旋至十一時後，七三號二二三號一七七號曾拉上至二五〇元光景，散戶漸感不支，一六〇號八號均售，二一八號亦供現永紗。十一時半後，又跌至二四一元及二四三元，二二三號力綱現遞不已，一一六號一七七號一二九號仍進，十一時四十分豐安會由一五六號掛漲停，償和由一五二號等買進，亦見俏利。永紗午收亦升爲二四七元及二四九元結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價，初低繼回，結果較上過六計信和漲半成强，美亞永紗新光永公微漲，景福中法新華尙平，華豐動興微降，麗安榮豐亦平，火柴內衣漲半成左右，中絲漲停後有回，軋升半成疆，量綸成交有限，雖升一成張，但不着邊。餘股雖升而不多，遞交股計信和升半成疆，永紗　亞新光微升，量嫌平而　豐微挫，塲外各老股均形平羅。</p>
<h3>統價起回風　外股尚平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨起回風，統丙晨開即低落少許，爲一二六〇〇元，自一二八〇〇元起，經五五五室五五二室賣到一〇八〇〇元，二三〇室三六〇室有納，最後在一一〇〇〇元外掙扎，結果較上週六計甲乙各跌二千二，絲丙降二千元，丁戊亦挫二千二，成交約六百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨堅後亦回，過程則互有參差，怡紗晨開曾躍升至十萬元外，廣帮及證券帮了結，而迫低至九萬五以內結束。結果較上週六計英聯業廣微升，怡紗紙業怡啤微挫，會德豐鋼業尙平，航業跌落半成。</p>
<h3>中信局昨日起　恢復配售人造絲　照各廠商申請量核配半數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨日恢復配售人造絲，係照各廠商申請量，核配半數。配價已加調整，計一二〇天橋，金三馬，早日，孔雀，地球等，每箱均二千二百六十萬元。一二〇東洋大富貴，每箱二千二百七十萬元。今後該局人造絲配價，將察酌市面情形，隨時予以機動式之調整。</p>
<p>據該局發言人稱：該局本年人造絲，到貨數額充裕，故對人造絲之充份供應，具有確切之把握云。</p>
<p>又訊昨市人造絲尙稱平穩，一二〇號，天橋新貨。上午二千五百萬元有成父，下午高山牌子二千五百十萬元賣出價，比上週末大起二十元。</p>
<p>昨市廠經，稍形活躍，成交價比上週末好起十萬至三十萬元不等，C字等級二千八百九十萬元有十包做開，貨身較上者二千九百三十萬元有五包成交，D字等級二千八百六十萬元亦有成交，高另擔二千八百三十萬元，AB等級及干經，均乏交易，喊價未更。</p>
<p>昨市綱貨真絲被面開市甚平，華强一千〇四十五六萬元，九點鐘以後，聞股票上升，人心好轉，直錢上升，倐忽之間升至七十萬元關外，七十二三萬元均有成交。後因不乏乘高價拋售，乃呈下降。最後收市爲六十萬元即期價，六十四萬元隔日期，大誠被面開市在一千〇四十七八萬元之間，最高喊到七十五萬元，收市即期價六十三萬元，隔日期六十七萬元。格子璧縐乏人過問，喊三萬五千元，四千二三百元有人要。華錦縐價高檔貨仍做二萬二千五百元，盛杭各貨，均與週末祖仿。</p>
<h3>食糧略見回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩，略見回好。公會劃盤，二〇中砂白五十六萬元，台亦袋莊五十六萬五千元至五十七萬元，草包五十五萬元至五十五萬五千元。四半白現貨六十六萬三千元，二四粗白高貨六十九萬元。汕糖因雨帮動辦，開出較多，而價亦略緊。提靑四十三萬元至四十二萬八千元，五千元，黃崗靑四十一萬五千元至四十萬〇七千元，成交二百餘件。興化白高貨六十萬〇二千元，次之五十八萬元。興赤四十二萬元，次之四十一萬六千元至四十一萬元，計二百數十件。刁靑另星開三十四萬五千元，海南赤百餘包，四十二萬九千元。</p>
<h3>至貨秈米居多　食糧初緊後懈</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧五千二萬餘石，來貨仍以稍米爲大宗，南市粳米及單薄零化尙覺熱鬧，挺升三五千至萬元，秈米暫乏榮辱，白陰元依然堅定之格。浦東新粳續到二三十石，市况初緊後懈，結果彷彿，際此天時晴朗，出數漸漸見湧，北市早疲繼挺，並無軒輊。</p>
<p>麵粉略有參差，廠粉因貨主甚堅，挺升一二千元，洋粉供不敷求，實銷奇旺，繼續飛奔萬元。惟雜牌粉則因江灣大塲南翔等處小型粉廠均有到申，供源尙多，做開均在十一萬二三千之譜。崑山五豐廠亦有獅馬粉裝申，呂質尙佳，售開爲十一萬三千五百元，市勢平正。統粉亦無上落，麩皮微加三五百元。</p>
<p>豆餅肥田銷令平常，萎靡不振，營口餅挫落三五千元，黃豆新貨長江到源踵接，浙江續有來申，而京滬綫丹陽陵口均已見新，去化平淡，價無榮辱，陳豆亦少出入。</p>

<h3>香港華商總會請求　修改廣州輸管法令　顧全國內原料之供求　兼及海外華僑之利益</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自行政院輸管令頒布輸入管理法令及廣州轉口禁令後，香港商務，大受打擊。香港華商總會爲維持僑商命脈計，經議決分呈行政院輸管會，懸管會廣東辦事處，華南輸出入管理委員會，請求撤銷或改善該項法令原呈略謂，我國行政院輸入臨時管理委員會所頒布之輸入管理法令，及廣州轉口禁令，自施行以來，本港僑商業務，大受打擊，案經本會召集會議，提出討諭，僉以應在不妨害國家經濟設施之原則下，將該原案撤銷或殺法改善，因（一）工業原料與乎交通及建設之器材，實爲我國目前之急需，故爲調劑合理之供求計，雖在經濟困難時期，亦似宜予以適量之輸入。（二）糧食品之供應，實爲民生所賴，其仰給於輸入者正多在不足情形之下，適量之輸入，又似為暫時所難避免之勢。（三）他如洋紙田料五金等貨物，其對於農工商業及文化敎育事業，皆有莫大關係，而國內所缺乏者，故在復興建設當中，雖一方面解救經濟之困難，而一方而亦不能不放寬輸入，以謀急切之供應。（四）廣州一地，非與外國直接通商，其有賴於香港之轉輸，已爲地理形成之事實，今根據管制法令港商無業可營，廣州供應不足，且在轉口禁令之下，華南各地均受牽連，撥諸裕民生，阜民財之旨，與乎培植華僑資產之措施，則對於該輸入禁令之施行，似有重加檢討之必要。（五）且自該管制新例頒行之後，據報軍所載，海關之收入大减，而走私之風大熾，准此情形，實與經濟之設施，背道而馳，徒令私梟有活躍之機，正當商人反無可營之業，殊非政府保護工商之旨云云。</p>
<h3>輸管會將開會討論　如何分配工業原料</h3>
<p>設法從技術上克服困難</p>
<p>輸入工業原料限額分配問題，工業協會與進出口商爭取頗烈。昨據輸營會負責人就此點談稱，依法律規定，輸管會所核准進口之限額，分配予進口商後，輸管會之負責已盡。但爲避免進口商之囤積作弊，故特規定，各進口商在領取進口許可證前，必需呈騐「銷貨合同」，證明彼等所進口之限額，確已售予工業工廠，本身並未囤而不售。但工業界認爲如此分配，仍不適當。輸管會當即請市商會及工業協會雙方共同商定一完善之分配辦法，如何確定分配比例，詎迄今雙方仍未妥協。工業界仍堅決要求進口原料需全部分配予工業界，輸管會方面則認有兩種因難：（一）一般零星用戶及不規則用戶，不經商人之手，無法配得原料。（二）工業界會員極多，在分配之技術方面，亦極困難。輪管會且亦無權限制某進口商獲得之進口額，必需售予某工廠。惟輸管會刻正重行商討一新辦法，另闢途徑，予以解決，使雙方均能獲得合理之分配比例數額。又謂迄目前止，在所有核准進口物資中，以化學用品，油脂臘，顏料，五金等四大類，因用戶複雜瑣碎，其第一期及第二期之輸入限額，均未分配完竣。</p>
<p>又悉：輸管會執行委員會日內將召開會議，澈底討論工業原料之分配辦法，設法從技術上克服困難，並將作硬性之規定云。</p>

<h3>肺病療養法　（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳紹青</p>
<p>（戊）幾件應當做的事</p>
<p>（一）傳染性的認識　傳染肺癆最易的途徑，即是痰，和涎沬，癆菌由此種媒介，傳染他人，所以衛生習慣良好的人們，決不隨地吐痰，最妥的方法，是將痰吐納於紙手帕中，然後焚燒之，使癆菌燒滅殆盡，咳嗽或噴嚏時，須以手帕掩口，使涎沫不至飛散</p>
<p>（二）起居飲食　應和別人分開，家中有小孩者，尤須特別注意，並須施行隔離，一人獨宿，房內宜通空氣陽光，食具如杯筷碗碟，每餐後須經開水者沸，使癆菌無法生存。</p>
<p>以上幾件避免傳染的方法，很容易辦到，但欲忠實地施行，必須有體念傳染的危險，和愛護他人的公德心，否則恐不願多此若干麻煩，如有不明瞭處，你的醫師，或公共衛生護士，願竭誠地釋解，並願協助指導。</p>
<p>（三）保持愉快的精神臥床靜養　凡有活動性的肺癆病人，無論他採取何種治療方法，必須在床上「靜臥」，這是治療的基本條件，並不是「休息」，僅不工作而已。欲求靜臥發生效力，必須精神愉快，心地　達，，然後纔能心平氣和，保特病床之樂，此話雖易說而難做，但確是療養肺病的秘訣。</p>
<p>（四）滋養飲食　牛乳鷄蛋魚肝油魚肉蔬菜以及新鮮水菓等類，皆爲營養食品，總宜配合平衡，不可偏廢，並無所謂「發物」，更不需什麼「忌口」，祇要消化得當而已。</p>
<p>末了還有一點要說的，就是你的肺病，必定從別人傳染而得來的，反過來說，你的肺病，在不知不覺中，或許已傳染了別人，關於前者，如你疑惑曾與某有病的接觸過，你必須勸其診查，以杜傳染之源，關於後者，你更有責任和義務，使你的家人或同房所住的人，都受檢查，有病即可半治，無病便可放心；若不如此辦，則癆病之潛伏滋長，永無已時，我國在此初步防癆時期，必須設法打破此惡性循環，是在每個病者，能善體斯意，通力協助，以收宏效。（完）</p>

<h3>困倦</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>生活在這樣一個無法用語言和文字來說明的時代裏，一個侷限於自己覺悟的領域寡的智識份子，感覺到無比的困倦</p>
<p>是若有若無的陽光，閃閃躱躱的足辰，迷迷矇矇的霧氣，我昏昏沉沉地跋涉着。</p>
<p>無盡的海洋，深邃的林叢，重車疊疊的高山與深谷，一望無際的草原，乾燥，無聊的沙漠：……我走着，在這樣複雜的境地裏，分不淸脚下踩的究竟是海波抑或是熾熱的砂粒，總之，我是這樣走着——非常困倦地走着，</p>
<p>爲什麼這未走？</p>
<p>本來我也是有一個目的和方向的，現在自然仍沒有改變，不過，由於對現實情景的厭惡而生出困倦的心理，我終於迷失在這樣一個旣不是深林，又不是海洋，更不是沙漠的心境裏；我，一個弱者之中的弱者，（我不知道應該如何來稱呼自己）不得不怨恨自己的懦弱，爲什麼不能够像別人那樣，選擇了應該走的道路，大踏步地邁進呢？爲什麼又不能像那些先知，在林莽中披荆斬棘，在深山裏菓路藍盡？而却任憑脚步的推移，踩在連自己也弄不淸的土地上，歪歪倒倒地朝着前面走呢？</p>
<p>看不見光亮，我是盲者；聽不到聲音，我是聾子；說不出心底想說的話，我是啞吧……只有我底心還沒有死亡，可憐的我，只能憑着心的指示，向前行走</p>
<p>究竟我所走的方向對不對呢？在意識識中我相信是對的，因爲從心靈的默察上，我知道那些先知者們，就在前面不遠。</p>
<p>憑着這一點點慰藉，我才這樣努力不懈地走着。是海洋，我就游泳，是高山，我就攀登；是沙漠，我就跋涉；是深林，我就穿過……我被鼠咬，被蟲傷，被荊棘破身體，然而仍然不停地前進——</p>
<p>我這樣發傻似的走着，被一些不聾，不啞，不瞎的朋友們訕笑，被一些會走捷徑會利用一切舟車工具的朋友們輕視，被一些喧喧鬧鬧的朋友們誹謗……我腔分辯，也不想分辯，只是憑着良心地役使，在凄凉，孤獨的境地裏踽踽獨行。</p>
<p>寂寞時，我唱着自己的沒有調的，咦咦呀呀的歌，，困惑時，我翻開背裏，裏面有一些書籍上，印着先知們的足跡，我用心靈在書葉上摸索着誦讀，我相信這些凸起的無際的語言。</p>
<p>我承認自己是個弱者，除了心地善良之外，簡直一無是處；我不想爲自己辯解，像那些爲善的狐狸，掛着一塊慈善家的招牌</p>
<p>我就這樣走着，日以繼夜地走着。</p>
<p>我饑餓，困乏，然而却不猶疑；我困倦，萎頓，却時時振奮着鼓勵自己前進。我是一個矛盾的集合體，然而在內心的紛擾中，時時力求行動，思想和語言的統一。</p>
<p>在這樣一個無法用語言和文字來說明的時代裏，我實在是一棵無花果樹，有樹的一切形態和實質，有果實，甚而也有內在的花；不過，我希望我底花朶開在心裏面，因爲我本無心於蜂鰈的撩繞。</p>
<p>無花果困倦於炎炎長夏，它不用花來表示季節的變易，我希望自己是一棵無花果樹，我底果實將成熱於不動聲色之中；向土壤，我時時刻刻地在吸取養神，我相信，只有土壤裏才有使我長大成熟的養料。我不想借重於別人的香氣來裝飾自己，也不想效法蔦蘿那樣去憑依大樹高及靑雲我只是我自己——一棵無聲色香　的無花果樹。</p>
<p>困倦的生活，我忍耐；風爾的傷痛，我忍受；我雖然不能庇騷小矗不鳥，却也不仰仗着豆結猛猷。</p>
<p>我是一無用處的，却也沒有賽當，我產果實，只是將我所着見的人間世相變成苦遊略帶甜味的汁液，供給世人；也許有一個旅人，找不到水源，找不到瓜果，那末，我也不吝奮於呈獻出　一盤點苦　而略帶甜味的果汁，</p>
<p>對於生活，我雖然感覺到困倦，却還沒有表示厭倦，從我四季常靑的綠葉裏，可以看出生命之源尚未枯竭，從我呈獻出的小小的果實裏證明我仍然有一顆紅的心。</p>
<p>無論如何，我是不不會去點綴這世界的，讓那此樂觀主義者的大樹，去用五色繽紛的花朶的點綴春天罷，去用馥郁的香氣，誇說世界的美好存在於未來的希望裏罷？我只是一棵困倦而不自暴自棄的無花果樹，憑着生命所付予我的生存的責任，我結實——</p>
<p>是的，我目前深深地感覺到對於世相的困倦，我也知道應該像那此先知者午，在林業裏披荊斬棘，為後來者開拓前路，他們是勇敢的先驅，我佩服深深地佩服。</p>
<p>請用我做一個前車之鑑罷，年輕的朋友們，應該選擇自己走的路，最廣闊最暢達的路；你們應該是雨滴，由小溪匯聚成爲大河，冲開隄防，朝着大海流去…</p>
<p>不要停止下來考慮，更不要顧慮到身邊的事物懷疑，記着：</p>
<p>『路本來是沒有的，有人走後才有路』。</p>
<p>記着，這是先知的預言，這是大勇大智者對光明坦途的奧秘的宣示。</p>
<h3>金玉跳脫</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>眞語：『萼綠華以晋升平二年十一月十日夜降羊權家，贈以詩一篇，幷致火澣布手中一條，金玉跳脫各一枚。』李商隱中元詩：『羊權雖得金跳脫，溫嶠終虛玉鏡臺；』陸龜蒙詩：『珍重雙雙玉跳脫，盡憑三島寄羊君，』皆用此事。按全唐詩話戰：『文宗問宰臣，古詩云「輕衫襯跳脫，跳脫是何物？」宰臣未對，上日，「即今之腕釧也』」</p>
<h3>簾邊隨筆</h3>
<p>— 東流</p>
<p>綠蒂的「庚子外紀」</p>
<p>法國小說家綠蒂（P.Loti）以「冰島漁失」「菊子夫人」等書馳名中國，前者爲黎烈文所譯，收鄭振鐸主編的世界文庫內，後者爲徐　村所譯，係商務版本。綠蒂筆調委宛曲折，善寫山水人物，而另有一種異國情調洋溢於其散文詩似的小說中。人咸知綠蒂爲法國海軍軍官，以其餘暇從事文學，竟有如此成就，可謂難能坷貴。曾經看到過他的照片，赫然裝佩劍，養成威廉式　鬚，外表儼然爲一道地之革人，與其幽美之筆調調，適成一對照。</p>
<p>綠蒂曾來中國，到過北京，而且還是八國聯軍中的一個軍官，兼做了法國通訊記者，用通訊稿編輯而成的「庚子外紀」，就是他對當年北京的觀感錄。</p>
<p>他目擊庚子之亂，自已也多少有點征服者的姿態，對於德軍統帥瓦德西則頗有微詞。他的「庚子外紀」一書裏有很多値得注意的史料，下面是他紀錄了北京城內外的混亂情形後的一段短文：</p>
<p>『一處園子的涼棚上，還正開着牽牛花，棚下橫着一個女子的屍體。這時暮寒已來，棚上花朶，却仍是映着那女屍統爛得有緻。』</p>
<p>『地板上　了一隻木桶，桶裏似乎有什麼東西在伸長出來，走近它的時候，忽然驚得，一跳，原來是一隻削去了肉的女子的大腿。屍體呢？誰知道人們把它拿去做了什麼呢？不過，　，這的頭是在屋裏呀，和一個小兒的玩具滾在一起，在椅子下面，已經完全變黑。　在長髮粉披之間，我們只能看　見從口裏　出來的白牙而已。』</p>
<p>這可以說是最詩意的寫實了。想不到中國人的大悲劇，一到外國小說家筆下，全變成了上好的做散文詩的資料。——『質絢爛得有緻』，讀了這句話，就不免使人有點噁心。</p>
<p>王國維和三明治</p>
<p>王國維也算得是一代學人吧，他的投水自殺的悲劇，據郭沫苦看來，還是他的恩人兼仇人羅振玉所賜予的。魯迅在「談所謂大內檔案」一文中曾論及王國維，有極妙的譬喩，文云：</p>
<p>「王國維已經在水裏將遣老生活結束，是老實人但他的感喟，却往往和羅振玉一鼻孔出氣，雖然所出的氣，有眞假之分。所以他被弄成夾廣吿的三明治，是常有的事，因爲他老富　像火　一般。』</p>
<p>說王國維是夾廣吿的餡子，誠然想人非非，但一想穿了，又覺得確甚形似。羅振玉之流的誇張「大內檔案」的珠寳氣，目的還是想多隊幾個錢，王國維不知　細，也跟着唱羅振玉的調子，而學術界對王國維尙有幾分信仰，因此在羅振玉之　看來，他的變成廣吿中的「三明治」，自然也是情理中事了。</p>
<p>半個隱士半個叛徒</p>
<p>看到一篇短文內提及局作人的舊事；</p>
<p>周作人說過：「生活不是很容易的事。動物那樣的，自然地簡單地生活，是其一法；把生活當做一種藝藝術，微妙地，美地生活，又是一法；二者之外別無道路，有的則是禽獸以下的亂調的生活了。」（「生活之藝術」）</p>
<p>他是主張微妙地生活的：「半個隱士，半個叛徒。」</p>
<p>可以叛的時候，就叛；可以隱的時候，就隱。在叛的時候，帶着隱的因；在隱的時候，帶着叛的果。在叛徒面前，他是隱士；在隱士面前，他是叛徒。隱與叛適可而止，叛與隱互爲體用。</p>
<p>爲誰而叛？爲誰而　？曰：主子。</p>
<p>——這節文章確是道及了周作人的內心隱秘的好文章。</p>
<p>而我却想起了魯迅所提到過的「繫有鈴子的山羊」，也想起「在狼羣中是羊，在羊羣中是狼」的那種可怕的獸類來了。</p>
<h3>夏夜散記</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>雨夜</p>
<p>市郊的夜是寂寞而憂戮的，</p>
<p>這襄沒有眩眼的霓虹，沒有流竄如龍的車子；都市的喧囂不能傳達到逼裏，一切都像經過過度的疲勞喘過一聲失望的嘆息後而收歛下來了。是這樣的寥落和悽愴喲！</p>
<p>往日我愛看夏天的黃昏，獨自到麥田邊去，繞過狹隘的畦徑，無目的地散進；有時佇立在　地的土堆上，眺望綴在天邊的暮彩。霞光雖是瞬息一現復逝，但是在遍地都是災殃的大地，這瞬息的輝華，不是很美的錦綉嗎？</p>
<p>黃昏一到了盡端，黑影統治了這空曠的地方，我便從外面回來，經過一段陰暗的路。大門前的燈亮了，我俯視自己冷淸的影子，走進屋子裏去。</p>
<p>今天夜裏，外面在下着大雨，我不能再到田裏去了。雨挾在狂風中，肆意地逞威，陣雨打在我的窗子上，不停的劈拍劈拍的聲音，像要敲碎我斗室裏的安寗。本來我們這間簡陋狹小的房子，從來沒有過安寗的，隨時都有突變的消息傳來；剛才同伴來閒談後，剩落感喟嗟嘆的聲音，還　繞在四週，像連串不停的痛苦的呻吟，使我駭怕顫慄……這些無形影的感觸，何曾使我安寗過片刻！</p>
<p>雨下得越來越大了呵！屋子外是一團漆黑，恐怖跟隨在後面。幾隻受風雨逼害的飛虫，從破爛的窗口撲進來，我呆望着牠們沾滿雨水的翅膀，向燈光週圍飛繞。這些弱小的生命，該是在患難中，要往光亮的地方掙扎吧？</p>
<p>一陣猛烈的急雨脚，從外國麥田裏掠過來；我還在看着飛虫，一時迷茫靜穆的心，受着這陣急雨來，復又突然激跳起來了。</p>
<p>電燈不知爲什麼忽然熄掉，這時夜已很深，可是我不想去睡。我點起一支小白燭，搖晃不定的微燄，增加了室內恐怖的氣氛。然而我還駭怕什麼呢！苦難旣已襲來，我要看淸這恐怖的雨夜，好讓明天放晴時，多去賞識遠天的雲彩。</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 周懷民</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　366</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>平心而論，耀羣的誤會，也並不純粹是誤會，這事只有我一人看得最淸楚，此外，在W君的慧眼觀察之下，也看得出八九分。鶴見爲了要讓自己和耀羣專心致意工作，所以儘量克服自己的感情；又怕感情沒有那麼容易克服，所以拿出日本敎育式的拙笨方法，採用電流絕緣方式，儘量避免與耀羣在一起工作。</p>
<p>然而耀羣這位東北女兒，個性直率坦白；牠給鶴見的那封信上，說得明明白白；工作管工作，感情管感情，一切聰其自然發展，不能因　廢食，倒把工作躭誤了。然而鶴見却是固職到底。</p>
<p>可是無論耀羣如何率直坦白，牠並不是一個超人，不能把女兒原有的心性，和女性天生的那個小弱點或大弱點—妒—完全消泯到零度，所以一見萍子出塲，一見鶴見那樣服服貼貼地（？）受萍子的指揮，就令耀羣是個超人，怕也有些嘔氣。何况牠對鶴見本來有些感恩知己咧。</p>
<p>過份抑壓感情，本來不是一個好玩意；其結果不是極端消極，就是大奸巨滑式的藏奸，玩手段；或矯柔造作；或是激成物極必反的公式，讓這抑壓得過了分際的感情，如黃河決了口似的，激流奔放，至於玩世不恭起來。</p>
<p>幸而耀羣把握得住，她沒有揀擇這些庸俗的途徑；反之，牠專心致意，把原有的工作計劃擴大起來。然在鶴見同萍子動身之後，牠和小老虎，拿了我替們弄來的「軍部許可通行證」，忽忽動身，上上闊外去了。</p>
<p>這時出關的交通，當然沒有平日那樣痛快，可是像耀會那樣的智機，而且又懷着一個大目的，當然沿路平安；旣沒惹事，也沒出事。至於小老虎，沿路有耀羣尅制着，就想管些閒事，也不容易辦到。</p>
<p>况且小老虎這一次回老寨，心上還　盤着一個很大的痛快念頭。睛想，他是白身出關的，不過一個普通大耳朶老百姓的小資格；甚至連廣義的「老百姓」資格都沒有；因他才十二三歲，離着成人還有一大段距離。可是這次回老寨，在短短的兩三星期中，居然正式受了等級雖說是個半生不熟的少尉階級，却大小總是個官兒，旣是個官兒，在他幻想裏，在回老寨的過程襄不能不有一點「衣錦榮是」的具體掠影，在他前腦或後腦杓子裏浮來浮去。</p>
<p>這時候您要是跟小老虎在一起，坐在那節改良二等客車裏，（實際是四等「悶子」車眞正頭三三等，輪不到「支那」人坐）您可以看得到小老虎，特別有禮貌，出奇的乖馴，一開口說話就掛笑臉。那一來就瞪眼的脾氣，這時一點也看不見了，那具有特殊魔力，碰着就可致人死命的一雙瘦手，這時伸了出來，也特別溫和，柔軟軟地，像那藏起了鋼爪的貓掌。走兩步路，也不那麼橫衝直闻，却是十分溫文爾雅。總而言之，他體味到地是個「官身」，不能那麼野蠻莽撞了。</p>
<h3>活教育</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>学校假如是死教育，那麼社會就是活敎育。一个学生丢開了課本，掀開「社會」的第一諜，一定應覺難　味苦，比起學校來，難受多了。</p>
<p>許多開出學校的人，常常非常反感，他們對於那些機關里的衛門作風，與官僚的派頭，常常把他們的一團「銳氣」，打得落化流水。</p>
<p>會逢承的人，也許覺得「阿謏蹈媚」算不了一回事，慢慢也會走上路，懂得假仁假義，學會「滾圓的滑」，學會鑒貎變色，學會社會上一切惡習氣。</p>
<p>經過社會久長黨陶的人，才能夠博得一聲：「老練」。這兩個字中，包括着多少張揚，也包括着多少「私德」的「貶價」。</p>
<p>「純真無邪」在這社會裏，常常眨爲「無知」，而一個懂得仰承鼻息的人，才够得上「老到」與「練達」。</p>
<p>這五花八門的社會，牽着你底鼻子，帶着你走向深淵，引着你走向罪惡。</p>
<p>一個大學生和一個中學生淪爲盜匪，（見八月三日本報）這是尋常又尋常的事。</p>
<p>但這課「活敎育」怎麼才可以不牽引純眞無邪的百年字生，不墮向向深淵，不走向罪惡呢？</p>
<p>這個責任，在於施用「活教育」的社會的本身了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「飛盤」與風箏反身器　這不是一個謎</h3>
<p>— 徐名模</p>
<p>「飛盤之謎」，不了而了，祗餘了微弱的尾聲，「見怪不怪，其怪自敗」，種種不安與恐怖情緒，無非只是庸人自擾，許多人在神經復常之餘，不免要啞然失笑吧。</p>
<p>然而，飛盤究竟是什廢東西？這個謎始終還沒有打破過。飛盤之實有其物是無可懷疑的，全世界各地都有人親眼目覩，決不能諉爲無稽謠言。硬否認這個事實，就無異要以一手掩盤天下耳目，這結果是徒勞的。我們也不贊成閉聾塞聰，不聞不問，像駝鳥一樣把頭鑽在沙漠裏，等到飛盤過去了，然後又把頭伸出來，望望天空，心裏覺得非常安慰。</p>
<p>飛盤究竟是個什麼東西？這個問題並不隨飛盤恐怖的消失而不復存在。科學的精神在於「致知格物」，我們對於至微之物如一粒塵埃，或看不見的東西如一個細菌，尙且要「格」過不休，更何况是這滿天飛的怪物。飛盤之謎一日不解，此心一日不能甘休；所謂「恥一物之不知」，在今日科學的時代中能容許「怪物」存在，便是科學的恥辱。</p>
<p>記者因為好奇心的驅使，對於飛盤曾下過一番思索的功夫，然而始終不能得到一個滿意的解釋，最近却無意中在一本美國的「料學通訊」（Scieuce　News　Letter）雜誌中得到一些綫索。這是一段簡短的新聞，其標題爲</p>
<p>Aluminium　Kite　Reflector　is　used　for　Tadar　Turget</p>
<p>「鋁質風箏反射器，作爲雷達的試騐靶子。」</p>
<p>新聞的內容說，美國惠司汀好斯電器製造公司的研究部，最近發明一種鋁質的風箏式的反射器，充作高射砲電達瞄準器的試騐射擊靶子，這是一種箱形的「風箏」，以繩索緊着於輕氣球，然後將氣球昇入於五百呎高的空中，以纜索使其固定。此種風笋靶子即充高射砲瞄準射擊試騐之用，如試騐成功，然後代以眞正之飛機。按鋁爲電達微波之最好的反射物質……。</p>
<p>這段簡短的新聞，已經足够帮助我們來解答飛盤這個神秘的謎—飛盤不是什麼神秘的東西，飛盤正是這種「鋁質風箏反射器」。我們試這樣想像：在美國（或蘇聯，或英國）的一次大規模的雷達瞄準試騐中（不一定是爲了高射砲的射擊瞄準，也許是其他秘密的特種試騐，因爲當達的妙用甚多，現在可以用來探測遠空的雨雲，甚至一羣飛鳥），有一個或數個的氣球突然因斷了綫索，乘風飛去，它們漸漸昇入高空（數百哩數千哩高的空中）拖了一大羣鋁質風箏反射器，最後因外間空氣過於稀薄，而終歸爆裂，於是這一批「風箏」就飄呀飄的下來，一直降落到世界的角角落落……。</p>
<p>這樣的解釋是近情而合理的，由此可見「飛盤」實是一種平凡而又平凡的東西；雖然新奇，但並不神秘。至於飛盤發現後，為什麼沒有負責的有關當局作切實的聲明，這是因爲軍事秘密的關係，凡事關軍事秘密，不論鉅細，當憶總不願聲張。倘若這秘密是蘇聯的，隔了一層鐵幕，更不會洩露片言雙字。美國李梅將軍會廣播說飛盤是一種高空測量氣象儀器，這顯然只是欺人之談。（據成都電訊，蓉郊發現「飛盤」，經川大敎授鑑定爲高空氣象儀器，我們從電訊中所述看來，可斷定此「飛盤」並非一般人所傳說目覩的飛盤。）</p>
<p>把「飛盤」的秘密拆穿了，也許好奇的人們，反而要感到失望。然而「科學」確確實實告訴我們，飛盤並不可能成爲恐怖性的武器；須知科學雖能創告偉大的奇蹟，科學絕不能無中生有，也不能創造人人所不能猜透的「怪物」，現代人所用的量厲害的武器如毒氣·細菌·原子彈等都不是無中生有的「怪物」。人類應用毒氣戰爭至少已有五百年的歷史，細菌戰爭的研究也至少已有二十年，原子彈在爆發五年前已開始製造，十年前已有人預見到，而廣島一彈發後一小時內，日本的政府就知道是什麼東西，現在一飛盤」飛了十幾天，我們還始終想不出其中有甚麼恐怖的可能性，可見「飛盤」之不足為畏也明矣。</p>
<p>「飛盤」這個空中怪物出現以來，不知擾亂了多少人的精神上的安寗，激起了多少不必要的恐懼惶惑，眞是一個時代的可詛咒的夢魔！個關禍的氣球，給世人開的玩笑也够了，我們現在希望把「飛盤」的眞相完全公佈。使運個緊張過度而疲乏不堪的世界，重獲—免於恐懼的自由。</p>
<h3>美金壹元　值風何？</h3>
<p>— 吳錚</p>
<p>美金一元的幣値，按照最近各國政府的規定，在英國可以兌取四先令，在法國可以兌換一百〇七個法郞，在荷蘭可兌二元六角，在丹麥可兌四元七角七分，在印度可兌盧比三元二角，在埃及可換廿五元，到了希臘可値五千元，在義大利可値六百里拉。到了中國更加値錢，官價可値一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的原子城　（上）</h3>
<p>— 彬之譯</p>
<p>—唐努鳥梁海</p>
<p>原子能的研究，已引起全世界科學家的興趣，蘇聯的科學家，當然是不會例外的。但這種大規模的研究，必需要有精密的實騐室，集中的工廠，甚至整個城市都要被充作原子能研究之用。蘇聯的原子能研究中心在那裏呢？這是一個神秘的謎。因爲蘇聯的難誌報章都經過嚴格的檢查，政府報告中也絕不提及關於原子能的資料，甚至連「鈾」那個字，在地質調查報告中也不看見了。</p>
<p>從各種事實來推測，唐努烏梁海很可能成能成為蘇聯的原子城。唐努烏梁海原是中國外蒙邊境一塊土地，一九二一年宣佈脫離中國而獨立，即投入了蘇聯的懷抱。後來蘇聯公然地把他歸併了，中國雖作微弱的聲辯，但有什廢用呢？</p>
<p>唐努烏梁海被選為原子城，是有他緣由的。那裏是一片廣大的山谷，處於兩座高山之間，普通的飛機是無法飛渡的。和隣近的地區，也被十幾座大小山峯隔着離着，形成一個孤立地帶。那裏的地形不是單純的，這正是建築堡壘的好所在。同時綿延的森林，深邃的岩泂，都可以進免敵機偵察的視錢。</p>
<p>那裏的氣候，四季的變化不大，土質也適宜種植，可以有大量的毅物產生。廣大的草原上，有無數的牛，羊，馬，駱駝等生活着。那裏雖是沙漠地帶，但水源也很充足，湖泊中充滿着游魚，河流中都可以通航，可以建立水力站的據點，隨處都是。而兩岸高縱的懸崖絕壁，正是天然的隱蔽物。在地下，還埋藏着無數的礦產：有金，銀，銅，鐵，鉛，鉑，　，鐳，錳，石綿，靈母石，羊鉛，金鋼石，陶土等。露出地面的媒田，更是俯拾即是。這許多却是研究原子能所不可缺的材料，唐努烏梁海有這樣豐富的物產，未但可以自給自足，還可以供還大量的軍隊，所以那裏可以與外界隔絕，秘密地從事原子的研究。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽團</p>
<p>美國的憲兵和警察</p>
<p>憲兵和警察雖同爲武裝同志，而所司職守却究全不同，互相尊重，各不相犯，因爲憲兵祇管軍鼠紀，警察即職權範圍極大，維持治安秩序，所以在美國有兵的地方還有憲兵，而兵沒有差假證是不許出營門的，有差假證而出發門的不許携帶武器。憲兵上差時由公家發給手鎗，却輕易不拿來使用。我在美國五年，尙未讀到憲兵或警察在鬧市練習打靶之事，也未聞有走火之奇談，兵器根本就沒有走火那麼一回事。所謂走火，係指機關鎗機械上發生故障，在開放時不能控制子彈，本來祗想發射三發的Short　Burst。結果全都放完。美國的憲兵並不是一種獨立的兵種，而是附屬於各兵種的，譬如一個空軍軍官學校，由各軍官及士兵輪流担任憲兵，每人値班時由公家發手鎗一支，臂章一條，上寫MP（海軍爲SP士兵載白鋼盔·卡其布綁腿，軍官則無之，他們專在各夜總會及酒排簡檢查本軍士兵有無酗酒滋鬧情事，以勸導的方式居多，根本用不着動武。憲兵不查戲院，在美國沒有看白戲那會事，這並不是說美國兵不看戢，而是說也門不層看白戲，因爲軍營裏有現成的戲院，每票僅一角五分，雖起碼小兵Private月餉美金五十十元每天看一聲電影，每月不過四元五角，可算微乎其微，城內民營電影院有二種價目，不分座位，成人是一種價目，平均的爲七角，小孩士兵是一種價目，約打一個七五折，軍官不得享受此種優待，軍官爲顧全自己身份起見，也決不會侵佔士兵的權利，寗可買正票或索性不看。軍人乘火車及公共汽車有優待，乘電軍則沒有優待。警察爲數極少，在小城市根本看不見警察，因爲交通已用自動紅綠燈，警察又穿便衣的居多，他們的手鎗多半藏在志服裏，決不掛在身上擺樣子，可是開起鎗來都是百發百中，不練習過幾千次打靶決不能當警察，他們捕捉盜犯時，向不把盜狂打死，而祇許擊中不致命處如腿部之類，以能阻止其遁逃爲限，而捉拿劇盜時，至多出動四五個人，決不需乎大隊人馬。兵在精而不在多，如果能把警憲的敎育水準提高，把人數减少，調整待遇，一定可以增加保國安民的效率，而老百姓也可少受許多威脅。（三五）</p>

<h3>Personnel Selection for Our Delegation to Japan for Investigation to be Decided at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Views Diverge Between the US and the Soviet Union on the Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] After the government decided to open private trade with Japan, the delegation to Japan for investigation is about to be formed and will depart on a regular basis. The personnel selection issue was discussed by the heads of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Economy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance, convened by Secretary-General Gan Naiguang of the Executive Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 4th. A general decision was made and will be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting on the 5th for a decision.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] Wu Yunchu, Chairman of the National Association of Industries, told reporters regarding the representation of the private industrial sector in the business delegation to Japan: Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the private industrial sector has already formed a small research group, which is conducting detailed research. Before a resolution is reached, the consideration of representatives to Japan will be temporarily suspended. However, since the government decided to open trade with Japan, it has not had any contact with the private industrial sector. If the government selects him for the delegation to Japan this time, he does not wish to participate either.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow, 3rd] The "Pravda" newspaper reiterated today to Western countries that the Soviet Union will adopt a tough policy on the Japanese peace treaty. The political commentator, Leontiev, wrote that before the peace treaty, the four major powers must convene themselves to draft the treaty and exercise full veto power over the entire issue. Leontiev continued, stating that the voting system of the Paris Peace Conference must be adopted to prevent the United States from exercising its power politics in voting. The Soviet Union should be responsible for insisting on this procedure because the Soviet Union's participation in the war forced Japan to surrender. The authority of the Far Eastern Commission is strictly limited to occupation policies and general principles, and drafting the peace treaty cannot be included. It must also be remembered that in addition to the countries of the Far Eastern Commission, there are many other countries that believe they have a great relationship with the Japanese peace treaty, and their reasons for participating in the drafting of the peace treaty are even more sufficient than those of some countries of the Far Eastern Commission. He continued: The various conditions of the European peace treaty must be insisted upon by the four major powers, and the resolutions in the Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam declarations must be implemented. The newspaper then listed the reasons why the Soviet Union should have equal say with the United States, Britain, and China: (1) The Soviet Union defeated Japan's strongest and most elite army—the Kwantung Army; (2) The Soviet Union completely defeated Germany, thereby accelerating the Allied victory over Japan; (3) The decisive final blow against Japan came from the Soviet army (Note: Pravda did not elaborate on this point); (4) During the war, the Soviet army kept Japan's most elite troops stationed in Northeast China from beginning to end, preventing them from being deployed elsewhere; (5) The Soviet Union fulfilled its responsibility to the Allied nations and declared war on Japan on time, according to the historical agreement reached by the major powers.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 3rd] Well-informed sources here stated: The statement in "Pravda" that the Soviet Union does not intend to relinquish its veto power over drafting the Japanese peace treaty is probably a trial balloon to determine whether the United States is willing to compromise on its position. The United States has already clarified its position to the Soviet Union and other countries of the Far Eastern Commission, that is, all member states have equal say, and resolutions are passed by a two-thirds majority vote, and no veto power can be exercised. Well-informed sources also said: The United States insists that veto power should not be allowed when drafting the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] It is learned that the State Department has decided to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to transfer the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty to the Council of Foreign Ministers for handling. If the Soviet Union insists, the United States government may take steps within the week to independently draft the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] Australian Ambassador to the United States Makin declared today that Australia insists on extracting reparations from Japanese industrial equipment in order to deprive Japan of its ability to manufacture war again. Australia will also request that the Japanese peace treaty stipulate that the Allied countries protect and supervise the Japanese way of life to ensure that it remains a peaceful country forever. The duration of the Allied supervision was not specified, but it was stated that the Australian government believes that control should continue until Japan's industrial and psychological war potential is completely eliminated.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Commission, reported on the historical overview of the commission at the first committee meeting on the morning of the 4th, stating that the purpose of the commission is to establish national capital in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. The construction goal indicated by the Chairman should make "capital nationalized and enjoyment popularized," which is the meaning of this. He pointed out that the construction of economic enterprises in various countries also has the same trend. Then, regarding the relationship between the commission and private enterprises, he said that the commission is assisting private enterprises in the following ways: (1) Incorporating private shares into the established business organizations to form limited companies, (2) Investing capital in private enterprises that have achieved results but urgently need to expand their capital, (3) Supplying private enterprises with power and urgently needed equipment. Next, he described the planned goals of the commission, stating that the commission's goal is not only to focus on daily profits and losses but also to focus on the construction and development of national industrialization. The focus is on establishing power sources, fuel production, steel smelting, manufacturing of major machinery and electrical equipment, and large-scale production of cement, fertilizers, sugar, and basic chemicals. Since these types of businesses require too much capital and are difficult for individuals to undertake, the commission has an unshirkable responsibility to establish a modern nation and should take on the arduous task with national strength.

Finally, the service creed of the colleagues in the association is listed as follows, and colleagues should encourage each other: (1) All work should aim to benefit the nation, the people, and the future of the Chinese economy, distinguishing between public and private interests, and never harming the public for private gain; (2) Colleagues in the service industry should not engage in private business of the same type, neither as shareholders nor in any related business; (3) Serve solely for the public good, not for private profit.</p>
<h3>Improving Coal Mine Production; Promoting Work Competition</h3>
<p>Measures Approved by the Coal Conference</p>

<h3>British Parliament Sends Another Delegation to China; Our Government Has Agreed; List of Six Delegation Members Not Yet Finalized</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union's Newly Produced Map Changes the Border of Mongolia and Xinjiang Without Authorization; Luo Jialun Discusses the Significance of the Soviet Action</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New Delhi, 2nd] "The mysterious changes made to the borders of Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang in the newly produced Soviet map can serve as a major clue to understanding the entire issue of Outer Mongolia's encroachment on our Xinjiang." Luo Jialun, the former Xinjiang District Inspector and currently our ambassador to India, told a Central News Agency reporter today. Ambassador Luo said that when he was responsible for conducting scientific surveys in Xinjiang, he noticed differences between two maps drawn by the Soviet Union in 1928 and 1940, especially in the significant discrepancies in the borders of Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia. For this reason, he also studied dozens of different maps. According to all the maps, it is proved that the entire Alpha area is a part of Xinjiang, and Bushan is within Xinjiang, about 200 kilometers away from the border of Outer Mongolia. However, in the map drawn by the Soviet Union in 1940, this area of 88,000 square kilometers was划 out of the border of Xinjiang Province. Ambassador Luo explained this matter, saying that when the Soviet Union drew the map in 1928, the Soviet Union and Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, maintained a friendly relationship, so there was no possibility of border disputes between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia at that time. It seemed that both Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia were under the control of the Soviet Union at that time. The change in the border on the Soviet map began when Sheng Shicai's pro-Soviet attitude was questioned. The Soviet Union's request for this 86,000-kilometer land in Xinjiang through Outer Mongolia seems to be aimed at cutting off the entire Xinjiang from the interior of China. Luo also pointed out that between the Altai Mountains and Hami, there is only a desert of Gobi Desert. Hami and Qitai are both on the edge of the desert. Therefore, if the strategic stronghold of Beitashan, where the Xinjiang authorities regularly stationed heavy troops and civil officials, and other important mountain passes in the Altai Mountains are lost, the six cities will not be able to hold. Since Hami and Qitai have no natural defenses, the eastern gateway of Xinjiang, which is rich in oil and gold deposits, can be closed off and isolated from the interior of China at any time.</p>
<h3>US and Canadian Ambassadors Arrive in Jinan; Give Public Speeches This Morning and Return to Nanjing in the Afternoon; Envoy Says US Aid to China is Only a Matter of Form</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] Ambassador Stuart answered questions from the Jinan press on the afternoon of the 4th. The main points are as follows: (1) China's current difficulties are internal, especially the need for knowledgeable youth and enlightened liberal elements to actively lead the new revolutionary construction movement, using construction to replace destruction. The efforts of the Chinese people can solve all problems. (2) The US attitude towards China and defeated Japan is that the US hopes that Japan will be strong, but it hopes that China will be even stronger. If Japan's economy cannot recover, it will inevitably be the root of future world peace crisis. (3) The ambassador deeply sympathizes with China's current difficulties, especially the suffering of the people. However, China's future, due to its long history, vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, as long as the people unite and make progress, everything is hopeful, and there is no need to be pessimistic and disappointed. (4) US aid to China is not a matter of principle, but a matter of form. It is believed that after Special Envoy Wedemeyer's investigation is completed this time, he will be able to provide the US government with reliable information and provide effective assistance to the Chinese government.</p>

<h3>Grain Collection Quota in Yunnan Province; Central Government Has Agreed to Reduce It</h3>

<h3>Tanggu New Port Issue; Wedemeyer Mission to Discuss in Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tianjin, 4th] General Wedemeyer flew here this morning from Peiping, and then met with Chinese military and political leaders and American business leaders, and is scheduled to meet with the Director of the "Tanggu New Port Construction Bureau" on the 5th. A semi-official Chinese source frankly stated that it hopes the United States can assist in completing China's only artificial port. It is reported that Tanggu New Port was secretly built by the Japanese during the tense war period, and was half completed by the end of the war. It is said that many Chinese workers who built the port were killed by the Japanese due to maintaining secrecy. It was only after the end of the war that the existence of the port was known. A semi-official source said: The new port is comparable to Qingdao's naval base. After completion, it can strengthen the control over the transportation of the Communist Party from Dalian to North China, and can also increase the convenience of transferring troops from South China to the Northeast war zone.</p>
<p>In commercial terms, after the completion of the new port, the largest transport ships can directly reach Tianjin. Currently, ships over 3,000 tons can only anchor outside the Tanggu port.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the embankment of the port is 17 kilometers long, making it the longest embankment in the world. In 1945, Thurman, the envoy of the Truman, inspected the new port, and he hoped that the United States could assist China in completing the port. Chinese officials said: China itself lacks funds and experienced engineers and cannot complete the port alone. Whether Wedemeyer will recommend that the United States assist is a problem.</p>
<p>First, Tianjin is a war zone and was threatened by the Communist army two months ago. If the Communist army launches an offensive in the Northeast in the fall, Tianjin will be severely threatened.</p>
<p>Second, at this time of overall trade stagnation, improving the port of Tianjin does not have much commercial significance unless Wedemeyer can bring a new policy to American commerce in China.</p>
<p>However, in military terms, because the port can be used as a naval port, it has great significance at present. Japan sent 700 technicians and thousands of Chinese workers under strict supervision to rush to build for three years, while the citizens of Tianjin knew nothing about it at the time. US planes never bombed the area. The iron and iron ore needed by Japan's war industry were transported back to Japan through this port. The Japanese Navy Department also planned that if the United States invaded Japan, the Japanese Navy would use this port and Qingdao to control the waters of North China.</p>

When the congress was held yesterday morning, 142 representatives attended and carried out election work.

(2) Implement democratic constitutionalism. (3) Participate in the general election, hoping for harmonious competition and realizing the spirit of Tao. (4) Implement major political reforms. (5) Promote the determination of national self-reliance.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The overseas general branch of the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to unite the reformists and convene a national congress on the 15th of this month, and believes that Zhang Junmai is surrounded by subordinates and can no longer exercise the power of the party leader.

<h3>Adjusting Civil Servant Salaries; This Time, the Focus is on Regional Level Adjustments; The Basic Amount Will Increase, but the Multiplier Will Not</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The method for adjusting civil servant salaries was brought up again for discussion at the Budget Committee of the Executive Yuan on the 4th. Because the method for adjusting the salaries of military personnel has not been determined, the discussion today did not reach a conclusion. After the standard for military personnel salaries is determined by the Ministry of National Defense and submitted to the Budget Committee for discussion, it can be passed by the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday. It is reported that this adjustment focuses on regional level adjustments. For example, the Wuhan area was originally second-class and will be upgraded to first-class this time. The general adjustment principle is that the multiplier will not be increased, only the basic amount will be adjusted. For example, the base amount of the first-class is 340,000, which will be increased to 440,000. This method will be implemented from August as soon as it is passed by the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The method of distributing rations to public officials in the Beijing-Shanghai area was originally said to be extended to other areas, but there are some technical difficulties in implementing this.

<h3>National Army in Shandong Suddenly Enters Yidu; Bandits Along the Yellow River Also Unable to Flee; National Army Intensifies Pursuit, Bandits Fall into Despair</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] Yidu is currently the next target of the National Army's attack in central Shandong. The bandit army secretly dispatched two columns to the area. It is reported that the National Army suddenly entered Yidu at 8:00 PM last night. Battles are taking place at various foreign strongholds outside Linqu, which are of the nature of clearing the battlefield. There is a part of the bandit army south of Yidu and east of Shangwu, which is being encircled and annihilated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The National Army pursuing to Yidu approached the suburbs of the city on the morning of the 3rd and occupied nearby key points. That night, they launched a fierce offensive against the remnant bandits stubbornly resisting in the city and finally rushed into Yidu County at dawn on the 4th after a night of fighting.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army's suppression units in various parts of central Shandong have been searching and seizing a large number of hidden weapons, ammunition, and military supplies from the Communist bandits, as well as most of the hidden officers and soldiers. In the Linqu area, the National Army has been accepting the surrender of Communist bandits, reaching hundreds of people every day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] Under the personal command of Commander-in-Chief Gu, the National Army in western Shandong is pursuing the Liu Bocheng unit of the Communist bandits, who are fleeing along the Yellow River, and has achieved the expected results. There are currently no organized escape attempts by the bandits in the area south of Yanzhou, Jining, Jiaxiang, Juye, Heze, and Dongming. The few remaining are being cleared up. In the above-mentioned areas, bandit corpses are found everywhere due to hunger and fatigue. Each of their weapons carries fewer than three bullets. The misery of the defeat can be imagined. Liu's bandits, who were lucky enough to cross the line north of Yanzhou and Dongming, wanted to join forces with the remnants of the 8th and 10th columns of the Communist East China Field Army, who were crossing the Yellow River west of Dongping Lake, to escape across the Yellow River within the borders of Zhangfan County. However, because the ferry crossing was monitored and blocked by the National Army, and the retreat was urgently pursued by the National Army, they are in a desperate situation and will be destroyed soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The 1st and 6th columns of the Liu Bocheng unit of the Communist bandits, who were trying to prevent the National Army from repairing the dangerous dikes of the Yellow River and counterattacking Linpu in the southwest of Juancheng, were strongly attacked by the National Army in Linpu on the morning of the 3rd. They have been defeated and are fleeing towards Zhangyoufang north of Jili. The National Army is taking advantage of the victory to pursue them.</p>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 4th] The remnants of the five columns of Liu Bocheng in southwestern Shandong, except for the 3rd and 4th columns, have fled to the National Army in Huangkou Linpu to stop the dike repair project. The main force of the remaining 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns have also been fleeing north since the 2nd to join the battle.

<h3>UNRRA Configures Generators in Guilin and Liuzhou, Transfers to Power Plants After Successful Testing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Medical Unit recently announced that the testing and installation of UNRRA generators in Liuzhou and Guilin have been completed by UNRRA's power experts. The two places were the most severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and their power plants often failed during air raids. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, they were so damaged that they could not be repaired. Therefore, both places obtained priority in UNRRA's power plant restoration plan. Liuzhou obtained a 500-kilowatt steam generator, and Guilin obtained two sets. At the beginning of this year, it was conducted under the guidance of UNRRA power experts Keber and Williams. When the two engineers measured the installation situation last week, they believed that it had reached the standard, so they handed it over to the local municipal power plant for acceptance. According to UNRRA's plan, it plans to provide China with 69 sets of generators, with a total power generation capacity of 58,000 kilowatts. It was originally planned to provide 12 sets of generators to the government areas and Communist areas in North China, with power generation ranging from 500 kilowatts to 2,000 kilowatts. Now, because UNRRA has banned the transportation of materials to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude, the generators have also been temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Our Country's Foreign Trade Problem</h3>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the government's implementation of trade control policies, people both at home and abroad have focused their attention on the various forms of so-called "discriminatory treatment" and "powerful family capital." General Wedemeyer's recent visit to Shanghai reportedly prompted American businessmen in Shanghai to question these two points. At the same time, the Central Daily News in Nanjing published an investigative report on "Fuchong" and "Yangzi" and other "powerful family capital," with staggering figures that shocked the nation. This newspaper once published an article urging calm thinking and detailed investigation, suggesting that the aforementioned report had omitted decimal points, leading to misunderstanding and further fueling the public's outrage over "powerful family capital." In reality, the power of "powerful family capital" was not as great as imagined, as they only obtained 0.87% of the total foreign exchange, less than 1%. The so-called "power" was truly pitiful. The Central Daily News later issued a statement admitting the error and making corrections. Simultaneously, the government authorities released information on the import and foreign exchange settlement situations of Fuchong, Yangzi, and other companies, confirming that the total amount of foreign exchange settled by these two companies accounted for approximately 0.0038 of the total foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank during the same period—which also included their export earnings. The true nature of "powerful family capital" was thus revealed to the world. As the general foreign public is now focusing on China's trade situation, we would like to offer some brief comments here.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that given the current situation in China, the government has no choice but to implement trade controls and manage imports. We have previously commented on China's current situation, particularly regarding the economic situation, stating: "The economic difficulties currently facing China are inextricably linked to the evolution of the political situation. The existence of the Communist bandits makes a thorough reform of China's economy, including a thorough reform of the currency system, impossible... However, the government, within its power, should do its utmost to salvage the current economic decline and cannot abandon this responsibility. This is why we see various economic controls, including import and export controls. Since there are controls, there are also restrictions on freedom..." The "discriminatory treatment" that is generally perceived is, in essence, largely due to the restrictions on "free trade." The Chinese government's policy has expressed welcome for foreign investment, and it would certainly not discriminate against Chinese and foreign businessmen. We have no discriminatory legislation, so there is no basis for talking about discrimination in China's foreign trade. This is a point we should emphasize.</p>
<p>Because there are controls, there are agencies, which inevitably lead to personnel issues. Delays in official documents and emotional biases may undoubtedly be irritating, but this is not a matter of law or policy. Such phenomena can occur anywhere in the world and are not unique to China. The Chinese government does not believe that the current control measures are beyond modification. As long as there is sufficient reason, we firmly believe that the Chinese government is prepared to accept suggestions and revise them at any time. As for delays in procedures and the occasional lack of dedication among minor officials, the government is also paying attention to these issues and seeking to improve them. China is currently in an extraordinary period, and we should have great patience.</p>
<p>We must also point out that the entire world has not yet returned to a state of tranquility, and world trade has not yet returned to normal. Under these circumstances, our foreign trade cannot be an exception. Only when the entire world returns to peace can world trade return to its normal track. Those engaged in trade should not focus solely on money but should take a longer-term perspective. We must understand why the world has not yet returned to peace and solve this major problem before international business and trade relations can develop normally. Similarly, those engaged in Chinese business and trade must understand why China has not yet returned to peace. Only after this problem is solved can China's foreign trade have normal development.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice Discusses Prison Reform: Number of Inmate Workers Reaches Over 140,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice and Administration, regarding the reform of Chinese prisons, stated: Since the abolition of consular jurisdiction, the Ministry has made prison reform a central task for the high courts of each province and their subordinate courts and prisons. The improvements and their effects are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improving Prison Construction: The Ministry has instructed each province, according to health standards, to first improve the construction of prison cells and workshops. The capacity of each prison cell and workshop must be based on adequate lighting and ventilation, and an appropriate number of inmates must be stipulated. Separate infirmaries must be established for sick inmates. Other facilities for inmate education, exercise, and recreation must be appropriately arranged. As of the end of June this year, the provinces and cities have improved 121 new prisons and 595 new-style detention centers.</p>
<p>(2) Improving Prison Hygiene: In June of the 30th year [1941], the Ministry issued six articles of "Prison Hygiene Precautions" and ordered them to be followed. In August of the 32nd year [1943], "Cleaning Items for Each Prison" were established and the prisons in each region were ordered to implement them conscientiously, and each prison was required to submit monthly reports on the implementation. Regarding the nutrition of inmates, based on the principles of righteousness and science, the Ministry studied the required amount of staple and non-staple food for each inmate per day, and drafted "Methods for Checking Prison Rations," stipulating that each inmate must be provided with the prescribed amount of staple and non-staple food daily, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and then ordered to be implemented in each province. Foreign inmates were given appropriate food based on their dietary habits and nutritional standards.</p>
<p>(3) Expanding Prison Labor: In the rear area, 86-87% of prisons have already established workshops. In the recovered area, from January of the 35th year [1946] to the end of May of the 36th year [1947], over 46% of prisons have been equipped with workshops. As of the end of May of the 36th year [1947], the number of workers has reached 144,867, accounting for over 78% of the actual number of inmates.</p>
<p>(4) Other: In order to align with the penal systems of other countries, the Ministry has reorganized the "Prison Regulations" and the "Provisional Regulations for Detention Centers," and drafted the "Prison Sentencing Law," "Detention Law," "Prison Regulations," "Detention Center Regulations," and "Progressive Treatment Regulations for Execution," which were promulgated by the National Government and implemented on June 10 of the 36th year [1947].</p>

<h3>American Soldiers' Homicide in Nanjing Fully Proven: Case Closed and Trial to Begin; U.S. Advisory Group Invites Chinese Observers to Attend Trial</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] All parties are paying close attention to the development of the tragic case of American soldiers throwing a Chinese air force soldier into the water outside Guangfengmen, resulting in his death. According to Captain Bauwar, the head of the military police of the U.S. Advisory Group, the entire case has been investigated and sufficient evidence of the crimes of Adori, Shuang Fanni, and others has been obtained. A spokesperson for the Advisory Group stated: Preliminary investigation work has been completed, and various trial steps are being prepared. The presiding judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney will be designated and announced shortly, and Chinese parties involved will be invited to send observers to attend the trial, with notices being issued soon. Tu Zhonghai, who witnessed the tragic deaths of the two victims, and Cheng Chaozong, the Chinese military police officer who identified the suspects, will both testify at the trial.

<h3>A Jurist Discusses Crime and Punishment with Reporters</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] On the 4th, a reporter inquired with a jurist regarding Captain Bauwar of the U.S. Military Police Corps' statement that the maximum punishment for the perpetrators in the case would be five to ten years in prison. The jurist explained that Bauwar's statement was based on two assumptions: First, although the perpetrators were military police, they were not on duty at the time of the crime and therefore could not be treated as military police; second, the perpetrators committed the crime while intoxicated. Of the two, the first assumption is particularly important. Whether being off duty affects their status as military police is a matter that can be studied. If the first assumption cannot be established, the second assumption would only aggravate their crime. We hope that the U.S. military will handle the matter with caution and not distort its own laws in order to reduce the guilt of its soldiers. Although this case is being handled by the U.S. military in accordance with the "Regulations for Handling Criminal Cases Involving U.S. Military Personnel in China," our observers may reserve their opinions when necessary and raise concerns through diplomatic channels.</p>

<h3>Security Council Achieves Unprecedented Success: India and the Netherlands Both Issue Ceasefire Orders; Indonesia Insists Dutch Troops Withdraw to Original Defense Lines</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th Radio: A State Department spokesperson stated that the United States has not yet proposed mediation in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to Indonesia. Whether to propose directly to Indonesia later has not been decided.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 4th] The Indonesian Republic issued a ceasefire order today and requested the United Nations Security Council to appoint an arbitration committee to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire by both sides. This is the first major victory for the United Nations organization in striving for peace since its establishment. The ceasefire order was broadcast by Radio Yogyakarta at 1:00 PM today (10:00 PM Shanghai time). President Sukarno will deliver a broadcast speech as the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces this afternoon. The Dutch ceasefire order was announced yesterday and took effect at midnight today. According to a Dutch spokesperson, most Dutch troops had already stopped advancing, and there was little activity in the area of Semarang today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 4th] According to Indonesian sources, Prime Minister Sjahrir and Deputy Prime Minister Setiadjit met with government officials this afternoon and then departed for Batavia and Yogyakarta, respectively, with undisclosed destinations. Before the Prime Minister returns to office, the Indonesian government will not issue any further statements regarding the United Nations Security Council's instructions. The Security Council's note directly addressed Sjahrir as "Prime Minister of the Government of the Indonesian Republic," which Indonesian officials particularly emphasized, believing that it demonstrated that the United Nations organization has already recognized the Government of the Indonesian Republic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 4th] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir departed from Bombay for Lake Success today. At the airport, Sjahrir told reporters: The purpose of going to New York is to find out what the Security Council can do. If the United Nations organization allows the Dutch to occupy the land they have seized in the past two weeks, then a mere ceasefire would only benefit the Dutch. This measure is insufficient to solve the Indonesian problem and is not what Indonesia wants. The Dutch must withdraw to their original defense lines before negotiations can begin. Sjahrir is expected to arrive in New York within three or four days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 3rd] The Dutch government announced that after the Netherlands issues a ceasefire order in Indonesia, Dutch troops will temporarily remain in the territory of the Republic that they have occupied since the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] The Indonesian government issued an important statement tonight, demanding that the Netherlands abandon the gains of the past thirteen days as a prerequisite for a ceasefire, and requesting that the Security Council designate several countries, with the consent of both Indonesia and the Netherlands, to organize an arbitration committee to mediate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 4th] A Dutch military spokesperson announced approximately twelve hours before the ceasefire deadline that Dutch troops had landed on the island of Madura, off the east coast of Java, and were transporting large quantities of rice to supply the island's more than one million residents.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Hostility Towards Overseas Chinese: Legacy of Japanese Poison</h3>
<p>[Central Press, Batavia, 4th] The reasons for the large-scale looting and burning of overseas Chinese property by Indonesian troops and mobs are summarized as follows: (1) Jealousy of the deeply entrenched economic power of the overseas Chinese, because Indonesian youths were poisoned by Japanese propaganda during the war; (2) Although Indonesia is rich in resources, the people are extremely poor, ignorant, and unable to distinguish right from wrong. During disturbances, they always believe that they can burn and loot without being punished; (3) Overseas Chinese have not expressed enthusiastic sympathy for the Indonesian independence movement, because overseas Chinese are in a very difficult position in the Dutch-Indonesian political dispute. Pleasing one side will inevitably offend the other; (4) Most Indonesian youths join the army to make a living, initially not considering the interests of the country and nation. They know very well that joining any combat group, whether equipped with weapons or bamboo spears, can provide them with a living; (5) Indonesian officials lack the ability to maintain law and order, especially in outlying areas; (6) Indonesian officials, including the police, lack a sense of responsibility. Once something happens, officials and police pack up and flee; (7) The decline in general living standards has led to illegal activities. Except for a small number who can receive salaries, other combat units must find their own means of support.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Defend Themselves: Organize Volunteer Security Teams</h3>
<p>[United Press, Medan, Sumatra, 4th] A Chinese volunteer security team of 700 people, including some who participated in the Chinese army before the war, is now protecting overseas Chinese in newly occupied areas by the Dutch army to prevent Indonesian attacks. The security team is patrolling before the Dutch ceasefire deadline. If the Indonesian army does not cease hostilities, they are prepared to continue patrolling. The backbone of the security team is former captured Chinese soldiers dispatched by the Japanese army to serve as labor battalions here. The reporter visited Padangsidimpuan, the Indonesian deputy capital of Sumatra, which was occupied by the Dutch army on July 30th, and saw several trucks of overseas Chinese arriving.</p>

<h3>Security Council to Discuss Egyptian Complaint Against Britain Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th Radio: The Security Council will begin discussing the Egyptian complaint against Britain tomorrow (Tuesday).</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorists Vow Revenge for the Dead</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 3rd] The Irgun, a Jewish terrorist organization that hanged two British army sergeants last week, broadcast today, vowing to execute seven more British soldiers to avenge the deaths of nine Jews executed by the authorities this year.

<h3>Churchill Delivers Speech: Admits Severity of British Economic Crisis; British Government May Abandon Socialist Experiment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): Churchill delivered an important speech today, admitting that Britain is currently in a deep crisis and declining daily. He reportedly said: "Britain is now relying on foreign aid to survive, a situation more bleak than during the war." Churchill emphasized that the United States must increase its aid to Britain, otherwise the sacrifices made by the United States for Britain during the war will have been in vain.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] Most London newspapers today speculated that the Labour government, given the urgency of the economic crisis, may have to postpone or even abandon the major industrial nationalization bills currently being implemented. Most Britons are on weekend vacation, while the authorities are busy drafting emergency measures to address the economic crisis, leaving them no time to comment on the reports. Therefore, the future of the Labour government's socialist policies remains a mystery for the time being.</p>
<p>The "London Observer," known for its reliable sources, reported that the steel industry nationalization bill, originally planned to be submitted for discussion after Parliament reconvenes in October, now appears to be abandoned. The cabinet discussed this issue during the past week, and although no final decision has been made, cabinet members strongly believe that this is not the right time. However, the suspension of nationalization plans for steel, gas, and electricity will also draw severe criticism from most supporters, who believe that socialism must be implemented quickly if the British economy is to be placed on a solid foundation once and for all. The Conservative Party will naturally be pleased with the voluntary abandonment of socialist experiments, as it has strongly opposed the steel nationalization plan.</p>
<h3>London to Host Negotiations to Revise Anglo-Iraqi Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters Baghdad, 3rd] Well-informed sources say that negotiations to revise the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty will begin in London this week or early next week. The Iraqi delegation will be led by Prime Minister Jabr himself, and will include the ambassador to London, Senate Speaker Saeed, Foreign Minister Jamali, and others. It is understood that discussions will be limited to the following four points: (1) the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq, including the Royal Air Force units guarding the Habbaniyah and Shaibah bases; (2) the appointment of British advisors and military missions; (3) economic and trade relations; and (4) the future of the Port of Basra and the Iraqi State Railways. The 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which expires in 1957, is an alliance treaty that stipulates that the Iraqi government shall allow British troops to be stationed in Iraq, cooperate with Britain in defense matters, and provide airbase facilities to Britain.</p>
<h3>US Army, Navy, and Air Force Unified Command: Forrestal Drafts Detailed Plan; Greater Power Can Be Unleashed in Case of Emergency</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 4th] According to military sources: US Secretary of Defense Forrestal is currently considering a plan to completely reorganize the armed forces in order to unify the command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on the US mainland. This plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The plan stipulates the establishment of a supreme commander, with a staff composed of Army, Navy, and Air Force generals, directly under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will then command the US border defense matters.</p>
<p>The plan also stipulates that the country will be divided into major military regions, each with a commander-in-chief who will command all three services in that region. This commander will be responsible for actual combat strategy, but not for supply and military administration. Military authorities believe that Forrestal can implement this plan through an executive order without the need for congressional approval. In fact, similar plans already exist overseas. For example, MacArthur commands all three services in the Far East, and Brigadier General Craig commands the three services in Alaska. Under this organization, the Air Force Commander, strategically important, will likely retain its military power as a self-contained system for long-range attacks on enemy countries with atomic weapons. On the US mainland, each theater commander is responsible for the unified national defense plan and, in the event of an emergency, is responsible for directing operations. The routine administrative activities of each department of the plan will not be changed, but its advantage is that the Army, Navy, and Air Force can jointly strike against an enemy attempting to attack the United States.</p>
<h3>Japan Still Actively Preparing for Antarctic Whaling</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 4th] A Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry spokesman said: Preparations for whaling in Antarctica in early November are in full swing. He also said that reports by Japanese news agencies that whaling may not be possible due to opposition from the Ministry of Finance are purely groundless. The government's finances are indeed difficult, but due to the severity of the food situation, the government will definitely send a whaling fleet to Antarctica.</p>
<h3>Soviets Celebrate Aviation Day: Hold Large-Scale Aircraft Display</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 3rd] Today is Soviet Aviation Day, and Moscow held a large-scale aviation display. Radio stations emphasized the Soviet Union's ambition to become a world aviation leader. Soviet Air Force Chief of Staff General Shtupov broadcasted: Marshal Stalin has stipulated the task of the Russian people as "to fly more, fly faster, and fly higher than anyone else." The Soviet Union already holds 65 of the 170 international aviation distance and altitude records. Marshal Astapov, Director of the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, wrote in the newspaper that the cargo capacity of Soviet civil aviation aircraft has increased five and a half times compared to before the war, and the number of passengers carried in 1947 is expected to increase five times compared to 1940. Moscow also announced that aircraft designers Yakovlev and Ilyushin are designing a civil aviation aircraft that can complete the 1,600-kilometer journey to East Island Ral in four hours, and it will only take one day to fly from Moscow to the southernmost city in Central Asia. Marshal Stalin and senior government leaders today visited the aircraft display at the Moscow airfield. Six different types of jet-propelled aircraft, including the Yakovlev fighter, made their first public appearance. "Reaction Assisted" (i.e., rocket-assisted propulsion) aircraft also participated in the performance. Jet fighters painted red formed various formations and soared in the blue sky, with extremely beautiful postures.</p>
<h3>Soviets Expand German-Polish Trade Relations: Form Eastern Economic Group; Polish Deputy Prime Minister Explains Economic Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 3rd] According to reliable sources: Representatives of the German Central Government and the Polish Government in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany have begun negotiations to expand trade relations, with the aim of consolidating the economic relations between the Soviet occupation zone and Poland, and concentrating the Eastern Economic Group. It is heard that the main negotiators are Morysi, Polish State Councilor and current head of the delegation, and Olerup, Minister of Foreign Trade of the German Central Government, and Selman, Minister of Economy of Saxony. The starting point of the negotiations is based on the agreement signed by the two parties in April of this year, which stipulates that the exchanged goods are standardized at US$28 million. The new agreement will expand the items and quantities of exchanged goods in order to lay the foundation for the economic integrity of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and form an Eastern Group of Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters Pi Langerdinia City, 3rd] Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the International Trade Fair here, stating that Poland cannot accept economic cooperation with other countries under the conditions determined by monopoly capitalism, but Poland will continue to pursue its commercial exchange policy with various countries. Gomulka also protested against the United States' decision to stop providing relief to Poland.</p>
<h3>Allied Control Council to Meet on Thursday to Discuss Japan's Foreign Trade Issues; Soviet Representative Raises Three Questions</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 4th] The 38th meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan will be held on Thursday of this week to discuss the future prospects for the development of Japan's export trade in 1947-1948 after the opening of private trade in Japan. This issue was raised by Soviet representative Major General Kislenko, who will represent Treffyanko, who is on leave returning to Moscow, at the Control Council. The Soviet delegation proposed the following questions: (1) What goods are Japan allowed to export this year through private trade and government-to-government trade, and in what quantities? (2) What measures has the Japanese government taken to increase the production of raw materials and export goods? (3) What are the obstacles to the development and production of commodities? What methods are currently being considered to increase production? The reason why this week's meeting is being held on Thursday instead of the usual Wednesday is to welcome the Canadian delegation to the parade in the Palace Square.</p>

<h3>Far East Tribunal Resumes Trial</h3>
<p>Japanese Lawyer Makes Absurd Remarks</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 4th] The Far East Military Tribunal resumed its trial work on the 4th, and the defendant's defense lawyers made a joint defense presentation on the part of Japan's launch of the Pacific War. Lawyer Takahashi first defended, saying: "The Pacific War was Japan's means of self-defense, not a war of aggression, so all the defendants are engaged in self-defense struggles." The reasons he cited were even more absurd and outrageous: (1) Japan's industrial economy developed in response to the needs of the people, so in the final stage, it transformed its necessary parts into war use; (2) Japan's population increased and land was insufficient, so the only result was to seek industrialization, but due to the scarcity of resources, it was bound to rely on foreign trade, but since 1931, high tariffs and import restrictions from various countries have hindered Japan's trade, and Japan's economy has been oppressed by this, so there was a sudden counterattack on December 8, 1941; (3) European and American countries promoted economic encirclement against Japan on one hand, and actively prepared for war against Japan on the other hand, and there was no fact that Japan had a joint conspiracy between the army and navy to launch a war of aggression. The views and thoughts of the army and navy at that time were opposed to each other.</p>

<h3>Jindu Bloodshed Case Enters Legal Stage; Chief Chen Orders Resolution Within a Week; Bao Qihuang Ordered to Arrive in Shanghai to Preside Over Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, who was ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the Jindu massacre, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 4th and immediately reported the investigation process to Chief Chen Yi, who forwarded it to the Chairman. The investigation has been completed, and the next step will be to enter the legal stage to seek a resolution. After listening to Deputy Minister Qin's report, Chief Chen immediately instructed several points of handling and limited the solution to within a week. On the evening of the 4th, Deputy Minister Qin met with our reporter and said about the training and investigation opinions: Both sides lacked sincerity, and they shirked each other in the pursuit of the first shot. In fact, both sides were at fault. If one side had made concessions, the fight would not have broken out. Qin also expressed regret over the fact that soldiers enforcing the law violated the law. It is said that the task of the police is to crack down on people who do not abide by the law, and the task of the military police is to crack down on soldiers who do not abide by the law. Both sides are responsible for maintaining local order. It is deeply regrettable that this kind of incident disrupted the order and that law enforcement violated the law. As for future handling, it will be resolved according to the law. First, it will be handed over to the military law for handling. Police officers without military status will be handed over to the judiciary for trial again. Qin said that the investigation work has been completed. He will no longer go to Shanghai, and the Ministry of National Defense will send responsible personnel from the military law department to Shanghai to assist in the resolution.</p>

According to Bao, he will continue to investigate before the trial begins. On the morning of the 4th, Bao visited Tao Yishan, director of the Investigation Office, and Zeng Zhaoyi, director of the Military Law Office, to discuss the matter. In the evening, Wu Guangyun, commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, visited Bao at the Ministry of National Defense guest house on Yu Yuan Road. Bao is scheduled to go to Jindu tomorrow to conduct an on-site inspection. In the afternoon, he will interrogate relevant witnesses and some officers and soldiers of the Military Police Regiment.</p>
<h3>Zijiang Wheel Case Continues; Company Says Unable to Salvage; Civil Claim Seeks Nearly 500 Million Yuan; Court Orders Continued Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Zijiang Wheel sinking tragedy continued to be heard in the first criminal court of the District Court yesterday. Only Xin Chengfang, captain of the Zijiang Wheel, and Li Qianyu, manager of the Tongji Steamship Company, and Zhou Naimeng, representative, attended the trial. According to Zhou Naihao, "Li Qianyu has gone to Tianjin and entrusted me to represent him. As for the company's recovery of corpses and sunken ships, according to the port law, if a ship sinks in a port due to an accident, the port director must be responsible if the shipowner is unable to salvage it. However, the port director said that Li already owed 5 million yuan in salvage fees and told Li that if the port authority was required to be responsible for the salvage, he should submit a written request, which Li had done. According to estimates, the cost of salvaging everything on the Zijiang Wheel is more than 450 million yuan, but the ship is only worth more than 100 million yuan after it is salvaged. The company cannot afford this loss." Then the witness Zhang Kunsheng, acting police chief of the Wusong Branch of the Port Police Department, was summoned. It is said that "Wang Hai, the port affairs section of the Customs Office, successively salvaged twelve corpses on March 1, 7, and April 2, six of whom had Zijiang Wheel tickets and six did not. Whether there are still corpses in the ship now can only be known after it is salvaged." Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, representing 33 families of the victims, requested an incidental civil claim of 490.1 million yuan (not the total amount), and stated the difficult living conditions of the family members of each victim, and asked the court to order the company to compensate a part first to be used to maintain living expenses. The court adjourned the trial to August 18 because Zhang Jinsheng, the captain of the Huatong Wheel, an important defendant in the case, had not arrived. The civil part ordered both parties to continue to attempt reconciliation out of court. Also, Zhou Haigen, a relative of the victims of the Zijiang Wheel, sued Li Qianyu, the manager of Tongji Company, for repeatedly delaying the recovery of corpses and attempting to destroy evidence. He filed a complaint with the court, and the District Prosecutor's Office has prosecuted him. The trial will begin in the second criminal court on the 7th of this month.</p>

<h3>Over Two Hundred Businesses Accuse a Local Thug of Eight Dramatic Crimes; Military Commander Orders Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over two hundred merchants from eleven roads including Ying Shi Road, Huang Pi Road, West Gate Road, and Xing Ye Road in the former French Concession jointly filed a complaint with the Garrison Headquarters, accusing Yang Bu You, a local thug residing at No. 111 Wang Zhi Road, and listing eight "dramatic" charges. Commander Xuan was enraged upon reading the complaint and issued a hand order to the Investigation Department to conduct a thorough investigation. A reporter from the Hua Jing News Agency has excerpted the original text of the eight major charges as follows: There are a great many unemployed vagrants in the former French Concession. This has become a common practice. Although there has been a crackdown in the past, these people do not till the land but eat, do not weave but wear clothes, and are always capable of extortion and theft. Those who have suffered directly from them are countless. Yang Bu You is the leader of these hooligans. Before the war, he faced criminal charges in the Huaiyin Commissioner's Office, and during the occupation, he was imprisoned in the "Wang Jingwei Regime" for two and a half years. He is truly guilty of heinous crimes and deserves to be killed. His most serious crimes include: (1)</p>
<p>Little Cowherd: Yang Bu You has recruited about a hundred petty thieves and rascals as his disciples, forming the Little Yellow Gang. They specialize in helping to push tricycles and rickshaws on the Suzhou Creek, extorting money from customers. Every night, they divide the spoils on the spot. Even children with no income are temporarily lent money by Yang. Another part of his gang specializes in staging injuries and picking pockets. They divide the spoils every three days, feasting on wine and meat in the style of Liangshan Marsh. (2)</p>
<p>Joyful Arrival: South of Linsen Road and north of Xujiahui, when shops open, it is customary for a group of beggar-like people to come to congratulate them, demanding money by force; otherwise, they will occupy and disturb the premises until their demands are met. The former French Concession is said to be divided into seven areas, and Yang Bu You's territory includes West Gate Road, Chongde Road, Ying Shi Road, Huang Pi Road, and Shunchang Road. When new stores open in this area, he must handle everything, sending people to solicit payments, with the highest amount reaching seven million. Moreover, the signature on the shop sign is Yang Bu You, which is clear evidence that he is handling everything, hoping to scare off other competitors. (3)</p>
<p>Demanding Jingzhou: In addition to handling the expenses for newly opened businesses, Yang Bu You also demands goods, such as toothbrushes and water bottles from department stores, and wool and tweed from silk shops. The same applies to other businesses. Looking at the furniture and decorations in Yang Bu You's home, their origin is all free. He "forcibly seizes Jingzhou" without considering the cost to others. (4)</p>
<p>Capturing and Releasing Cao Cao: In the lower social circles of the Nanshi area, when there are quarrels and fights, they often ask Yang to mediate. After paying a certain amount for transportation, Yang has people capture the other party and scold them at tea houses and restaurants. The justification depends on the amount of money paid. Whichever party prepares the preliminary conditions first can go home. Those without money must be detained for one or two days until their greed is satisfied before being released. (5)</p>
<p>Gathering of Heroes: The practice of forming mutual aid societies has become a thing of the past because every society will eventually dissolve, and many people are deterred. Yang has a novel idea: he invites people to contribute to a society of 100,000 or 200,000, feasts everyone on a selected date, and has each person pay their contribution. Those who draw the lucky number will have their principal returned in installments, while the weak are like meat buns thrown to dogs, with no return. A group of wandering thugs are truly pitiful. (6)</p>
<p>Copper Net Formation: Sending out invitations and playing music has long been banned. Most hooligans have disappeared, but Yang blatantly ignores this. At least twice a year, either for birthdays or anniversaries, he distributes red scarves to shops, demanding 30,000 or 50,000, trying to get as much money as possible. He held one event on April 14th this year, reportedly earning one or two million. It is rare to see such a rogue sending out invitations. (7)</p>
<p>Powder Chamber: Yang is also involved in drug trafficking. He was reported last year, and he fled upon hearing the news. Nineteen small packets of heroin were found in his residence at No. 111 Wang Zhi Road. He still dares not surrender to the local court. (8)</p>
<p>Severing the Sutra Hall: Yang Bu You's first wife was a Wang from Huai'an. They were married for three years but had no affection. Her father was hypocritical and resembled Wang Mang, unaware of his son-in-law's behavior and wanting to report him to the authorities. Yang preemptively killed his concubine and fled to Shanghai, where he married Wang. During the victory two years ago, the Youth League arrested hooligans, and Yang escaped while his wife secretly left and has not returned. Yang used the case to frame his enemy, Lu Pengfei, causing the Lu family to be ruined. Now Yang is cohabiting with a concubine of a traitor and concealing a large number of counterfeit assets. He is incredibly bold.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hong Nian's Sham Trial Concludes; Admits Only Being "Nominally" Employed at "Central China Railway"; Lin Kang Hou and Tang Chou Min Have Nothing to Say</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zheng Hong Nian, former president of National Jinan University and president of the puppet Central China Railway Company, was accused of being a suspected traitor. The High Court originally sentenced him to eight years in prison, but Zheng appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The case concluded yesterday at the High Court, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 11th. During yesterday's hearing, the High Court summoned Lin Kang Hou and Tang Shou Min to testify. Zheng, wearing a beige silk robe, looked old and frail. He testified, "I originally did not want to come out and work and repeatedly refused, but I had no choice but to take the position of president of the puppet Central China Railway Company. I am old and cannot handle practical responsibilities, only holding a nominal position at the puppet Central China Railway Company. The actual responsibility was borne by the Japanese vice president." When questioning the witnesses, Lin Kang Hou and Tang Shou Min testified, "Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the three of us were in Hong Kong. After Hong Kong fell, the enemy threatened us to take puppet positions, which we refused. Later, we were escorted to Shanghai by the Japanese. As for Zheng's rescue of underground workers during his tenure in the puppet position, you must ask Wu Shao Shu. Regarding the preservation of the railway, you must ask Shi Yu Shou. We are not aware of the situation." After the prosecutor's arguments and the defendant's lawyer's defense, the court scheduled a date for the verdict, and the defendant and witnesses were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Exemption Applications; District Reviews Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Urging Citizens Not to Request Transfers Temporarily</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The city's extended deadline for applying for exemption from military service for eligible draftees (including technical workers) expires today. The Civil Affairs Bureau announced that it will no longer accept further applications. At the same time, the work of investigating applications for exemption from military service in each Bao has ended today. Opinions have been signed in the investigation results column of each Bao, serial numbers have been assigned, and the documents have been bound into volumes. Three copies of the name list of draftees exempt from military service have been prepared and sent to the district office. The district review period will be from tomorrow to the 15th.</p>
<p>[Additional News] On the eve of the start of military service conscription, many citizens in each district are requesting to move out of the area. To avoid the phenomenon of draft evasion, the Civil Affairs Bureau has ordered each district to advise citizens not to request transfers temporarily unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Lives Lost in Qingpu; Township Head of Xiaoyin Denies Involvement</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zou Bao Xian, the puppet Township Head of Xianyuan Township in Qingpu County, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court for the bloodbath in which fifteen lives were tragically lost during the enemy puppet period. Yu Kesheng, the puppet Township Head of Xiaoyin Township and a suspect in the same case, fled while charged with a serious crime. The High Prosecutor's Office sent a document to the Qingpu County Government requesting his arrest. After the Qingpu County arrested Yu, he was escorted to the High Prosecutor's Office on the 24th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, the High Prosecutor's Office transferred Yu to the Special Criminal Court of the High Court for legal action. Judge Qiu Huan Ying immediately interrogated Yu. Yu was thin and short, wearing a blue cotton short shirt and white cotton shorts. He testified, "I became the Township Head of Xiaoyin Township in August of the 33rd year. I was not involved in the case of the fifteen lives. Xianyuan Township and Xiaoyin Township are more than five Li apart. I did not go to the meeting they summoned. On the night of the incident, I only heard the sound of gongs. Later, I heard people say that a dozen bandits were killed by the guerrillas. I do not know the other details." The court ordered the legal clerk to take Yu into custody because the case still required a substantive confrontation with Zou.</p>
<h3>A Citizen in His Fifties Volunteers for Military Service</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Mayor Wu recently received a petition from citizen Cao Xianglin, stating that he was willing to comply with national laws and volunteer for military service, requesting to be enlisted as a volunteer soldier. Cao is currently employed at the British Tramway Company in the city, residing in the B household, No. 10 Jia, No. 69 Bao, 5th District. He is fifty years old. He is indignant at the large number of eligible draftees trying to avoid military service and specifically petitioned Mayor Wu to make an exception and recommend him as a volunteer soldier. After receiving the petition, Mayor Wu ordered him to consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau since the citizen was fifty years old, which was not in accordance with the provisions of the military service law.</p>
<h3>A Glorious Old Barber Talks About the Past by the Mirror; Many Party and State Elders Had Their Hair Done by Him</h3>
<p>Began Cutting Braids for Revolutionary Comrades; Thirty-Six Years of Barbering</p>
<p>[Special Report] Time is a cruel tide, and history is forever churning in its giant waves. While the waves are full of floods, there are also bubbles. Cherishing and collecting some bubbles may be helpful for future historical records! We visited a person who has experienced the vicissitudes of life with this in mind. This is a barber who has spent thirty-six years with a razor in his hand. (See attached photo, taken by this newspaper)</p>
<p>We met this barber on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Association. His name is Luo Boli, from Shunde, Guangdong. He is fifty-two years old this year. When he said his first sentence: "I joined the Tongmenghui in Manila when I was eighteen," I was surprised. It turned out that he was a veteran of the revolution! His barbering career began in the first year of Xuantong because he had a special task at that time, which was to cut braids for revolutionary comrades. So from the Philippines to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, he officially picked up the razor and became a barber at "Yi Le Ye".</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Haircut Never Exceeded Ten Minutes</p>
<p>"Yi Le Ye" was on the bottom floor next to the Daxin Company at the time, and it was the only barber shop of its size in Shanghai. Because he had that past connection, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen came to Shanghai, he was always in charge of cutting his hair. Dr. Sun Yat-sen lived at No. 14 Muliduoa Road (a road near Fuxing Park now). The furnishings in his home were extremely simple. The only people living with him were two adjutants and Mr. Hu Hanmin. Due to his busy state affairs, he had his hair cut only twice a month, and each time never exceeded ten minutes. He said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was very simple when it came to grooming. His hair was stiff and he never used oil. When shaving his face, he often inquired about the organization of the Shanghai labor union, urging him to set an example and be responsible for unifying the barber union, having these six companies pay dues to lay the foundation for the revolutionary work. After the haircut, Dr. Sun Yat-sen ordered the adjutant to pay two yuan and said to him: "Any industry is equal in front of revolutionary work."</p>
<p>Iron Lao Paid Attention to Shaving; Ambassador Guo Loved to Dye His Hair</p>
<p>Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, state affairs were chaotic. Warlords occupied the land, and many party and state leaders stayed in Shanghai to plan. Wu Tiecheng, Guo Taiqi, Ye Chuyi, and Zhang Ji took rickshaws to "Yi Le Ye" to have their hair cut. Iron Lao paid the most attention to shaving. After the shave, he had to use an electric face grinder again, and the haircut had to be slow and methodical. In the sound of the scissors, Iron Lao always closed his eyes and quietly appreciated the moment of comfort and tenderness under the shadows of the knife and soap. Ambassador Guo was young and handsome, so he naturally paid special attention to grooming. When he sat upright and handsome in the "easy chair" in clean clothes, Luo Boli carefully and habitually protected the two tufts of soft hair on his temples. Because this was the forbidden area that the ambassador cherished most, no white hair could be exposed above the ears. In the photos of Ambassador Guo from that year, wasn't there a shining head of hair that was combined inside and out? This was Luo Boli's proud masterpiece from more than twenty years ago!</p>
<p>At that time, Wang Jingwei, Deng Shaokun, and Chen Jie were also Luo Boli's regular customers. When Wang Jingwei had his hair cut, he was different from others. Before and after cutting his hair, he had to compare the beauty of his entire head and face. If he felt that the haircut did not add to his original "young man" appearance, then he would only pay two dimes at most. His posing mentality often made him put money and face on an equal footing to deal with everything. This was completely different from Ambassador Guo, although the ambassador also wanted to be beautiful, he did not use money to support his likes and dislikes. He always paid regularly: four dimes for a haircut and two dimes for a shave, with no tip.</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen Urged Speed; Finished in Two or Three Minutes</p>
<p>When Ji Boli cut Soong Tzu-wen's hair in his residence on Qiqi Road around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he was most worried that his cutting speed would not meet Soong's sudden requests. Soong would urge him to "hurry up!" and everything had to be finished completely in two or three minutes, without oiling or arranging, the payment was always the same, five yuan in silver dollars. Sometimes Soong's wife's sideburns at the back of her neck also had to be trimmed, but that was not common.</p>
<p>The generosity and sincerity that Dr. Kong Xiangxi showed during his haircut always made Luo Boli feel grateful in his memory. Every time after having his hair cut, he would sign the bill and then slowly and calmly reach into a "wallet" to grope for money, constantly saying to Luo Boli in a humble manner: "I haven't given you a tip yet!" As a result, four dimes in silver dollars were groped out under Luo Boli's half-pushing and half-accepting. Luo Boli said: "Although the actions of the old-fashioned figures are not in line with the times and are not bright enough, their hearts are very good."</p>
<p>The Hero Suddenly Became Shy; Cai Tingkai Became a Regular</p>
<p>The most interesting thing was General Cai Tingkai. His haircut was originally a scattered line strategy, without a fixed place, sitting down and cutting his hair anytime, anywhere. Later, for some reason, this hero who charged into battle suddenly became shy and felt uncomfortable because there were many onlookers in the store who treated him as a target for evaluation. At that time, "Yi Ye Ye" had already closed down, and Luo Boli had moved to the Bankers' Association. So, after being introduced, General Cai entrusted Luo Boli to be responsible for his grooming in a small room in the association.</p>
<p>Luo Boli also incidentally told the reporter that in the past, "Yi Le Ye" had a specially made "brushing head device", the form of which was like a disc used for perming hair now, suspended in mid-air, slightly cylindrical below, specially used to replace soap to wash and grind the head to make it clean. People used to happily put their heads into this cylinder to enjoy the comfort of grasping, brushing, washing, and scraping. This "brushing head device" was later dismantled and sold as scrap iron by the descendants of the store owner Shi Dezhi, and no second one has appeared in Shanghai to this day. He said very emotionally, as if there was infinite desolation in the luxurious memories.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Loved to Talk About Peking Opera; Dong Xian Guang Came Every Three Weeks</p>
<p>Now, Li Fuxun, Zhang Jiaao, Bei Songsun, Wang Xiaolai, Dong Xian Guang, and others are regular customers of Luo Boli in the Bankers' Association. Wang Xiaolai is healthy and strong with a beard around his cheeks. When he is shaving his face, he often talks to Luo Boli about his love for Peking Opera. Luo Boli used his hands to simulate Wang's facial outline and said: "Good skills, truly a typical giant hammer face"!</p>
<p>Dong Xianguang comes to Shanghai once every three weeks and must have his hair cut. When he is half-lying and reclining in the "easy chair", he always likes to chat with Luo Boli about his family life, in a gentle and detailed manner. The situation is probably very cordial and warm. Unfortunately, one day was missed. On the eve of the reporter's visit, Dong happened to be grooming. It is said that he paid a tip of 5,000 yuan when he left and shook hands with Luo Boli to say goodbye.</p>
<p>The weather was too hot, so I shook hands with him to say goodbye. He said at the end: "The monthly salary at 'Yi Le Ye' used to be fifty yuan, but now he earns two million a month in the association. A haircut used to cost only two dimes, but now it costs more than ten thousand!" Looking at his slightly lamenting back, these 36 years of barbering are telling us how we have survived a difficult era!

<h3>The City's Largest Pumping Station Completed After More Than a Year and Over 500 Million Spent; Can Pump 60,000 Gallons Per Minute</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Municipal Public Works Bureau hosted the city's press at 3:00 PM yesterday to visit the recently completed giant sluice gate and pumping station in Rihui Port. This project took more than a year and cost 560 million yuan and is the city's largest pumping station. Its purpose is to alleviate waterlogging in the western district of the former French Concession. According to the drainage system of the former French Concession, except for the eastern part that directly exits into the Huangpu River, most of the drainage pipes discharge water into the Panjiabang River in the south, which then exits into the Huangpu River through Rihui Port. Therefore, after the dam and pumping station are built at the northern end of Rihui Port, the water flow can be controlled. According to the engineer yesterday, the function of the dam is to prevent high tides from flowing backward, the function of the gate is to facilitate the discharge of rainwater during low tide, and the function of the pumping station is to pump the rain water in the Panjiabang and discharge it into the Rihui Port, so that the ebb and flow of the tide will have no effect on the former French Concession, and waterlogging can be improved.</p>
<p>When the reporter went to observe, the pumping machine was running at full power, drawing the stinking water from the Jiangjiabang into the Rihui Port. Vortices appeared from time to time, and the speed was very fast. The station has two 70-horsepower motors and one 85-horsepower motor, pumping a total of 60,000 gallons of water per minute. According to Director Zhao, it is estimated that the entire amount of water in Zhaojiabang can be pumped out in half a day.</p>

<h3>Distribution to Public School Employees</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The China Textile Company, in accordance with the resolution, will stop reviewing summer distribution applications from July 16. However, the Shanghai Public School Employee Material Supply Review Committee sent a letter to the company requesting it to continue distributing supplies because of the time it takes for official documents to be exchanged and the delays caused by procedures, resulting in letters arriving at the China Textile Company after the 15th. The China Textile Company has replied agreeing to continue distributing supplies and has set a deadline of 5:00 PM on August 8th.</p>
<h3>Thief Visits Brothel, Joy Turns to Sorrow, Broker Changes Stolen Goods, Implicating Madam</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At 2:30 PM on July 30, Wang Songling, representative of the Gongxing Glass Company at No. 233 Zhizhi Road, reported to the Hongkou Police Precinct that between noon on the 29th and 10:00 AM on the 30th, the door lock of the company's warehouse at No. 75 Haining Road was pried open by thieves, and 24 boxes of glass, worth about 13.9 million yuan, were stolen. At 6:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, Xu Jixian, the owner of Gongxing Company, reported to the police station that a broker was carrying glass samples to his store for sale, which were very similar to the stolen glass, and requested that the police be dispatched to No. 2333 Zhili Road for investigation. Officer Ying Rumo, Gu Zhonghai, police chief Zhao Bingyue, and police officer Chen Youshan, accompanied by the reporter, went to investigate and found that the glass had been purchased by broker Chen Agui and stored in the Xietai Rice Store at No. 12 Xiamen Road. The words printed on the stolen glass box boards matched. The stolen goods receiver Chen Agui was taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, he purchased the glass from Jiang Ting, the madam of the Chunyang Copper and Tin Store at No. 219 Qipu Road, for 9.2 million national currency. Jiang Ting was introduced by a friend from Tanggu Road to Zhu the Monk, who lived in a shed at No. 197 Donghan Bili Road, and obtained the glass for 6.32 million and ten yuan. The police were dispatched to arrest Zhu, who confessed that he had an accomplice named Fan Xueping. That night, Fan was arrested in the Yuanchangli brothel on Yuanchang Road and confessed to participating in the transportation of the stolen goods, and also confessed the two main culprits, Xiao Jiangbei and Ye Huicheng, but they were both at large and not apprehended. In addition to returning the stolen goods to the owner, the police station sent the thieves and the stolen goods receivers to the local court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>American Woman's Gold Watch Stolen, Returned Intact, Almost Implicating an Innocent Friend</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] American woman Mrs. Shi Ni Neng, residing in Room 815, Broadway Mansion, No. 81 Huimin Road, was passing the intersection of Huangpu Road and Wuchang Road at about 9:00 AM the day before yesterday when she was suddenly robbed by a gangster of a precious gold watch (worth 200 US dollars) of the Prime Minister brand. The watch had a gold chain and two small diamonds inlaid on the side. Afterwards, the American military police detained a suspect named Fang Linhu and sent him to the Hongkou Police Precinct for interrogation, but Fang categorically denied it. After the police learned that Fang was indeed just a small worker and had nothing to do with the case, they ordered him to be released on bail. According to a tip-off, the original stolen goods were found in the Hecheng Pawnshop at No. 183 Tiantong Road. Officers were dispatched to investigate and found a Prime Minister gold watch. According to the person in charge of the pawnshop, at about 10:00 AM on the 3rd, a man in his thirties, wearing a suit and shirt, short in stature, speaking with a Shanghai accent, came to the store to pawn the watch, claiming that it belonged to his wife and that the chain was accidentally broken. The watch was taken back and returned to the owner. The robber has not yet been caught and is currently being pursued.</p>

<h3>Pawn Shops Changed to Buying Pledged Items, Identification Cards Should be Recorded</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce previously believed that the measures formulated by the Police Bureau, restricting pawnshops and second-hand stores from redeeming pawned items and selling goods within ten days, were too strict and could not be followed in practice. Based on the request of the Dianzhou Pawnbrokers Association, the City Chamber of Commerce forwarded the request to the Municipal Government, requesting that the original order of the Police Bureau be revoked. The association received a reply from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the case had been resolved at the 86th Municipal Conference, and the original measures were revised. All pawnshops should record the name, address, and national identification card number of the pledge when purchasing pledged items. If they do not have a national identification card, the pledged items cannot be redeemed within ten days. If redemption is necessary, a shop guarantee or a person with a similar occupation is required to guarantee it.</p>

<h3>Xi'an City, Under the Jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, Takes the First Step</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Xi'an] The Xi'an Municipal Government, which has been changed to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, was officially established today (the 1st). The first mayor, Wang Youzhi, only yesterday resigned as the head of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education. This afternoon, at his first press conference, he firmly stated his long-term policy goals: "Xi'an City, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, should be built into a modern cultural city that meets modern standards and serves as the center of cultural activities in the Northwest." In another written statement, he also solemnly cautioned the 600,000 citizens: "Although Xi'an is the ancient capital of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties and the cradle of Chinese culture, it seems to have succumbed to the pain of cultural decline in modern times..."</p>
<p>According to the new mayor's explanation, the significance of Xi'an's elevation from a provincial city to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan lies in emphasizing the importance of Xi'an to the national defense, politics, economy, and culture of the Northwest.</p>
<p>However, the "first step" towards this goal has encountered difficulties. Because in this time of upgrading, there are no more than 600,000 people; tax revenue is also minimal, less than 1 billion yuan per month. With such manpower and financial resources, it is certainly impossible to support a large administrative organization, nor is it easy to rely solely on local forces to implement large-scale construction plans. This is a realistic problem, and we can illustrate it with numbers.</p>
<p>In order to save administrative expenses, the new municipal government's organization may adopt a simpler plan, with only six bureaus within the municipal government. In this way, the monthly administrative budget is 1.7 billion yuan, which is 40% less than the 2.9 billion yuan budget for a plan with eight bureaus. Which way to go will be decided in the short term. Currently, the municipal government's revenue is 1 billion yuan per month. After 30% is allocated to the central government, 70% is allocated to the local government. Even if a simpler structure is adopted, the monthly expenses will still be short by about 800 to 900 million yuan.</p>
<p>The new municipal government's start-up cost is 10 billion yuan, which Nanjing believes is a bit high. The exact amount of the subsidy is still under review. The construction budget totals 120 billion yuan, divided into three items: water supply, drainage, and road construction, each with 40 billion yuan. Nanjing is currently reviewing these together with the construction costs of the other three cities under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Xi'an Waterworks Project to Begin Immediately, Decides New City Government</h3>
<p>The most urgent project to be built in Xi'an is the waterworks project. If the central government's subsidy is insufficient, even if there are 10 billion yuan, the new municipal government has decided to start preliminary work immediately. For the rest, it plans to attract private capital and convert it into a joint government-business venture or a government-supervised business venture.</p>
<p>The four main crossroads in the city center are planned to be converted into cement roads to achieve a permanent solution and, in fact, save on future road repair costs.</p>
<p>Sewage and public toilets are also planned to be built gradually to improve public health. In addition, strengthening household registration, improving people's welfare... these are all blueprints in the new mayor's mind.</p>
<p>"We will not do things that the citizens do not want; we will do things that the citizens want." The new mayor repeatedly emphasized this to the 600,000 citizens at several gatherings today.</p>
<h3>The City Government Spends One Penny to Achieve the Effect of One Penny</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of Xi'an's conversion to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the 600,000 citizens are concerned less about the anticipation of a beautiful future than about whether the current and future burdens will increase. Regarding this point, the new mayor explained it in two aspects: "In the future, we will never increase the citizens' extra burdens, but citizens have the obligation to shoulder their due burdens." He believes that it is the citizens' obligation to share municipal expenses, and that the current burden on Xi'an citizens is much lighter compared to the citizens of other counties. He hopes to increase the city government's revenue by reorganizing tax sources, eliminating tax evasion, and striving for effective expenditures, spending one penny and seeing the effect of one penny.

<h3>Ladybugs in Quzhou Devour Citrus Scale Insects</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Quzhou] The western townships of this county, such as Hangbu, are rich in oranges, with vast orchards and abundant yields, which are the main secondary product for local farmers. In recent years, insect pests have occurred, with a type commonly known as "white shell insects" being particularly harmful, resulting in low quality and reduced yields. Year after year, there has been a risk of extinction. Scientific or traditional methods of prevention and control have been repeatedly applied, but to no avail, greatly affecting the local economy. According to visitors from the township, a type of ladybug has recently been found in large numbers near Hangbu, specializing in preying on the aforementioned white shell insects. The insect pests, which had been ineffective in control for many years, were unknowingly wiped out. The farmers in the township are immensely grateful. (August 1)</p>

<h3>Another Tragedy at Heishi Pass: Soldiers Drove Away the Ferrymen and Sailed The Boat Themselves; The Boat Crashed Violently into Bridge Piers, Suddenly Breaking Apart; Twenty-Eight People Rescued, Thirty-One Drowned, Bridge Difficult to Repair</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Kaifeng] Continuous heavy rains in western Henan have caused the Luo River at Heishi Pass on the Longhai Railway to rise sharply. The bridge there was destroyed by the water on the 27th. All trains on the east-west lines were stopped at the bridgehead, and wooden boats were used to ferry passengers to maintain traffic. Unexpectedly, a boat capsizing tragedy occurred at Heishi Pass on the 28th, drowning thirty-one elderly, weak, women, and children. Twenty-eight people were rescued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>On that day, there were nine wooden boats at the ferry. The boat involved in the accident was the last one crossing from the west bank to the east bank (passengers on the No. 3 train of the Longhai Railway). At that time, soldiers from a certain unit, Shi Yufang and Yang Chaohua, and others were helping each other to cross. They insisted on sailing, but the boat owner saw that there were too many people on board, exceeding the weight limit, and that the water was turbulent. He informed them of the danger and refused to sail. Shi and Yang not only did not listen but also drove away the ferrymen. The road bureau's car affairs, engineering section chiefs, stationmasters, supervisors, and guards stepped forward to dissuade them, explaining the dangers, but Shi and Yang insisted on not listening and started sailing themselves.</p>
<p>At this time, another boat arrived, and about half of the passengers were transferred to that boat. Unexpectedly, Shi and Yang did not know how to swim. When the boat reached the center of the river, because the water was extremely strong, they could not steer it and were at a loss. The boat went down with the rapid current and crashed into the bridge pier of the Heishi Pass Bridge with a loud crash. The wooden boat immediately broke apart, and all the passengers were submerged. The road police at the bridgehead saw the situation and shouted urgently. Twenty-eight people were rescued, most of whom were elderly, weak, women, and children, in addition to the soldiers. There were several children aged one to three. Finally, an old woman and a girl in her teens were also retrieved, along with fifteen pieces of luggage. A total of thirty-one people were killed in the accident, which is truly tragic.</p>
<p>To comfort the affected passengers, the road authorities not only prepared coffins for the deceased and waited for their relatives to claim them, but also gave each family 100,000 yuan to be collected by their relatives. Those who were rescued were provided with food for one day and given 50,000 yuan for travel expenses. At the same time, the perpetrators, Shi Yufang and Yang Chaohua, were escorted to the Zhengzhou Investigation Office for legal action.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked the road bureau负责人 about the bridge construction situation, they said that the water level is now too high, reaching over 99.75 meters, and it will be difficult to repair it in the short term. Work can only begin when the water level drops to 92.00 meters or below. During the unrepaired period, wooden boats will still be used for ferrying. (August 1)</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper in Xiaoshan] Recently, a stretch of hidden sand about ten miles long has risen near Haining on the north bank of the Qiantang River, causing the river flow to shift southward, with rapid currents eroding the Nansha sandbar, leading to increasingly severe collapse.

<p>[Report from our newspaper in Suzhou, 4th] A prison riot occurred at the No. 1 Prison in Shizikou, Suzhou, at around 9:00 AM on the 4th. The drug trafficker Wang Yong, who was sentenced to seven years and is currently serving his sentence, is known for his recalcitrant character. Even in prison, he widely recruits followers. Recently, he wanted to share food and utensils with other inmates but was unsuccessful. Harboring resentment, and coinciding with the replacement of the warden in charge of inmates in the Second Division, Wang feared that restrictions would be tightened. Therefore, he took the initiative and gathered more than 30 inmates from his cell this morning, rushing towards the printing workshop inside the prison. At that time, the iron gate of the workshop aisle was destroyed, and the workshop instructor Zhou Qingping was injured in his left arm. Fortunately, soldiers from the Second Division of the Youth Army stationed in the prison were deployed to suppress the riot, preventing it from escalating.

<h3>Hong Kong Charity Swimming Gala; Five National Records; Liu Diding and Huang Wanzhen are Male and Female Stars</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Station] The sound of disaster relief is everywhere, and the charity swimming gala finally took place at the Hong Kong Swimming Pool. The time was the evenings of July 29th and 30th, starting after 7 pm.</p>
<p>After the great war, Hong Kong's swimming pools, facilities, and buildings are still very poor. The few slightly satisfactory swimming pools are either privately owned or military restricted areas. Therefore, public swimming sheds are mostly built by the sea.</p>
<p>The Chung Sing Swimming Shed in Sai Wan, Kennedy Town, is directly accessible by tram and is considered to be one of the more complete swimming sheds! The lighting is also pretty good. Because of the wonderful programs and the participation of the Victoria Recreation Club, the situation on both nights can be described as lively.</p>
<p>In terms of results, the meeting was very rewarding, with five events breaking national records.</p>
<p>The most intense competition was in the 100-meter freestyle. Wu Nian was still closely following Liu Diding in the first 80 meters, but Diding then overtook him in the final stage.</p>
<p>In the women's group: Huang Wanzhen retained the championships in the 50-meter and 200-meter events. I think: It is currently difficult for anyone in Hong Kong to compete with her for these spots. Wanzhen's swimming style is also very beautiful.</p>
<p>The five national records broken were: Liu Diding's 100-meter freestyle, Chen Zhennan's 400-meter freestyle, and Huang Wanzhen's 50-meter freestyle in the women's group. The other two events were relay races. The Victoria Recreation Club, Chung Sing, and Lai Chun teams in the men's 4x100-meter freestyle relay all broke the national record, and the Lai Chun team also broke the national record in the women's 4x50-meter freestyle relay. The overall champions for men's and women's teams was the Lai Chun team (98 points), and the runner-up was the Victoria Recreation Club (47 points).</p>

<h3>Announcement of New Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>20-count yarn at 9.8 million yuan per piece</p>
<p>[Our Report] The new negotiated prices for cotton yarn were officially announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday morning. 20-count yarn is priced at 9.8 million yuan per piece, an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the negotiated price on the 1st of last month. The negotiated prices announced for other counts of yarn are: 10-count yarn at 6.82 million yuan, 16-count yarn at 8.62 million yuan, 32-count yarn at 13 million yuan, and 42-count yarn at 15 million yuan. According to the announcement by the Textile Adjustment Committee, all of the above negotiated prices are the highest selling prices at the factory level. Yarn merchants may add a profit of 5% based on the factory price. Retail prices may add another 10%. As for various other counts of yarn and cotton yarn of various brands and trademarks not listed above, they should be priced with reference to the above prices according to market customs, provided that the price of the same count of cotton yarn does not exceed the highest negotiated price agreed above, otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs contacted the Textile Adjustment Committee by telephone yesterday morning, with the intention of approving the new negotiated price of 20-count yarn at 9.6 million yuan. However, after considering the negotiated price of 9.8 million yuan proposed by the Shanghai factories, they reluctantly approved it. However, national and private yarn factories were instructed to provide at least 1,500 pieces of each count of cotton yarn for allocation and sale yesterday to avoid fluctuations in the yarn market due to the initial implementation of the new negotiated price. However, yesterday, only the China Textile Construction Corporation opened 1,500 pieces of each count of yarn, and the private Shenxin Yarn Factory opened approximately 600 pieces of each count of yarn. No other factories opened any.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of a leader of a private factory, the price ratio of the fine yarn prices announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday did not follow the original ratio calculation of the former Textile Control Committee, so they were all insufficient, and many factories hesitated to open. However, it is heard that the factories have decided to continue opening today. The quota of yarn to be opened by the private factories is calculated as: Shenxin 600 pieces, Yongsha 300 pieces, Xinyu 200 pieces, Tongyi, Zhongfang, Chongxin, Baofeng, Anda, Rongfeng, and Xinhe 100 pieces each.</p>
<p>According to another aspect, yesterday's negotiated price was decided at the negotiation group meeting last Saturday. If the fine yarn price is calculated according to the original ratio, it will exceed the current market price. The Textile Adjustment Committee's negotiation is based on the principle of not exceeding the market price. Therefore, the market situation was temporarily observed, and a slightly lower price was negotiated. Furthermore, the market's appetite for fine yarn has been very small recently, and sales to foreign countries are not smooth, so the market price is weak.</p>
<p>When the negotiation group meeting was held last Saturday, it was decided to organize a factory yarn opening inspection team, consisting of Gao Bingtai from the Textile Adjustment Committee, Zhang Fangzuo from the Textile Construction Corporation, and Zhang Wenqian from the private factories. Their responsibility is to go to each factory to inspect the yarn opening situation, the amount and price of yarn opened, etc. It was originally planned to depart for inspection yesterday, but because the private factories said that the cotton yarn would continue to be opened today, the date was temporarily changed to today, and then they will go to each factory for inspection.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee's negotiation group meeting will be held again at 4 pm today, where the negotiated prices will be discussed. In the future, negotiated prices will be set every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and yarn will be sold at listed prices on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales Slow</h3>
<p>The initial cotton yarn market yesterday was slightly promising, with manufacturers making sporadic purchases, but actual demand remained sluggish. By the close of the market, Shenxin Factory had yarn open, and the allocation price of yarn opened by the Textile Construction Corporation was raised again. The listed price of 20-count Heavenly Girl was raised to 9.8 million yuan, and the price of 42-count Lima was 16.6 million yuan, and the opening was extremely flat. Although there was an increase in negotiated prices, buyers did not pay attention to it, and the market atmosphere was rather weak.</p>
<p>As a result, the fine yarn 42-count Blue Phoenix rebounded by 100,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 17.25 million yuan. Shuiyuehao rose by 50,000 yuan to 17.15 million yuan. 20-count Qing Shuangma fell by 50,000 yuan to 10.85 million yuan. The prices of other Heavenly Girl, Zhongshuang Earth, and 16-count Guangming Hongfeng Benteng, 10-count Zidi Jun Jinbaoxing fine yarns of 40-count and 32-count, etc., all fell, ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Lifeless</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday initially showed signs of resilience, as the Textile Construction Corporation, in accordance with the resolution of the Textile Adjustment Committee, raised yarn prices, and insiders thought that the prices would be firm. The leading fine cloth even rose to 438,000 yuan. Later, due to little activity from foreign merchants, the intention to enter the market slackened. Shops and merchants in the street also lacked initiative. Finally, the market price of 12-pound cage head fine cloth fell by 3,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 432,000 yuan. The prices of various fine cloths such as Five Gu Blue Chicken Color Ball also fell by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. The market prices of other white grey cloth, serge-colored cloth, and shilin cloth were all flat and soft.</p>
<h3>Stable Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market yesterday was stable due to yarn factories absorbing supply, and prices did not fluctuate, but the number of transactions was still not high. L.S.S factory price was 2.2 million, Huoji 1.725 million, stack delivery price was 2.12 million for Xuefei, 2.2 million to 2.25 million, Shashi 1.965 million, Hankou fine fluff 1.96 million to 2 million, Chong Tongzhou 1.995 million, Huo 1.72 million, and Puzi flower 335,000.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Sales Slightly Recover</h3>
<p>For the past ten days, woolen products have been affected by the slack season of hot weather and various environmental factors, such as the obvious influx of woolen gabardines from Hankou to Nanjing and Shanghai, resulting in a nominally flat but realistically fatigued market, with extremely sluggish actual transactions. Yesterday, on Qipan Street and at the Changle Tea House, overcoats and Yuanzhigong fabrics showed signs of recovery, as sales to foreign merchants have gradually started, and merchants from Chongqing and Chengdu have been searching for supplies, while merchants from Xi'an and Changsha have also been requesting samples. This has also boosted the popularity of other woolen products.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Intentions in the Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks remained strong yesterday amid ample liquidity, with strong buying interest from various parties, and high prices were seen across the board. China Silk opened up and immediately rose to the limit, while Yongsheng rose by 10%, a rare occurrence recently. Bullish investors rushed in, and the market briefly fell back in the middle of the session, but buyers still added to their positions near the close, and the market recovered its strength. Lianan once rose to the limit (without successful trades), while Xinhuo Firecrackers and Zhonghua were relatively strong during the half-day session, due to the former's capital increase and the latter's generous bonus share offerings.</p>
<p>The market opened higher in the morning, continuing the momentum from last Saturday, with China Silk rising to the limit from 117 to 142. After opening at 252 yuan, Yongsheng saw gains at 73, 4, 60, 231, and 85, rising to 256 yuan. Bankers sold at 207 and 45, while bullish investors also sold at 235, 154, 179, 223, and 76, and short sellers at 232 and 224 increased their positions and supplied Yongsheng, pushing the price down to 245 yuan and 247 yuan for spot and forward deliveries, respectively. 231 took advantage of the low price to buy Yongsheng, and 94, 155, 185, and 85 also bought, pushing the price up to 252 yuan. 154, 186, 76, 157, 235, 232, and 207 still supplied and sold, and 97 resold Yongsheng, pulling back to 243 yuan and 245 yuan. The price of Meiya was also sharply lowered to 428 yuan and 433 yuan due to supply from 117.</p>
<p>After fluctuating until 11 o'clock, 73, 223, and 177 briefly pulled the price up to around 250 yuan. Retail investors gradually felt unsupported, and 160 and 8 both sold, while 218 also supplied Yongsheng. After 11:30, the price fell again to 241 yuan and 243 yuan. 223 strongly supported spot and forward deliveries, and 116, 177, and 129 still bought. At 11:40, Fengan Association hung up at the limit at 156, and Changhe bought at 152, also showing strong profits. Yongsheng's noon close also rose to 247 yuan and 249 yuan.</p>
<p>After the close, bids initially fell back and then recovered. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Xinhuo rose by more than 50%, Meiya, Yongsheng, Xinguang, and Yonggong rose slightly, Jingfu, Zhongfa, and Xinhua remained flat, Huafeng and Dongxing fell slightly, Lianan and Rongfeng also remained flat, the price of Firecrackers and underwear rose by about 50%, and China Silk rebounded after rising to the limit, gaining over 50%. There was limited trading volume in Lianglun, and although it rose by 10%, it was insignificant. Although other stocks rose, the increases were not significant. In forward deliveries, Xinhuo rose by over 50%, Yongsheng, Meiya, and Xinguang rose slightly, the volume was flat, and Rongfeng fell slightly. Various old stocks in the over-the-counter market were generally flat.</p>
<h3>Uniform Prices Rebound, Foreign Stocks Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Government bonds rebounded yesterday, with the uniform price of C opening slightly lower at 12,600 yuan, starting from 12,800 yuan, and being sold to 10,800 yuan by 555 and 552, while 230 and 360 made purchases. It finally struggled outside of 11,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B each fell by 2,200, silk C fell by 2,000 yuan, and D and E also fell by 2,200. The trading volume was approximately 6 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also rebounded after being strong yesterday, but the process was uneven. Yi Yarn once jumped to over 100,000 yuan in the morning, but was pressured lower to below 95,000 yuan due to profit-taking by Guangdong merchants and securities firms. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British United, Industry, and Guangdong rose slightly, while Yi Yarn, Paper, and Yi Beer fell slightly. Jardine Matheson Steel remained flat, and Shipping fell by 50%.</p>
<h3>The Central Trust Bureau Resumes Rationing Rayon Yesterday; Allots Half of Each Manufacturer's Requested Amount</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Trust Bureau resumed rationing rayon yesterday, allotting half of each manufacturer's requested amount. Prices have been adjusted upwards, with 120 Tianqiao, Jin San Ma, Zao Ri, Kongque, and Diqiu brands all priced at 22.6 million yuan per case. 120 Dong Yang Da Fugui is priced at 22.7 million yuan per case. Going forward, the Bureau's rayon rationing prices will be adjusted dynamically based on market conditions.</p>
<p>According to a Bureau spokesperson, the Bureau has a sufficient amount of rayon arriving this year, and therefore has a definite assurance of fully supplying rayon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rayon market was relatively stable yesterday. 120 count Tianqiao brand new goods were sold for 25 million yuan in the morning, and Gao Shan brand was sold for 25.1 million yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 20 yuan compared to the end of last week.</p>

<p>The raw silk quilt cover market was very calm at the opening yesterday. Huaqiang brand was at 10.456 million yuan. After 9 o'clock, it was reported that stocks were rising, people's confidence improved, and prices rose sharply, with transactions at 7.723 million yuan. Later, due to a lack of high-price selling, it declined. The final closing price was 600,000 yuan for spot and 640,000 yuan for deferred delivery.

<h3>Mostly Indica Rice Arrives; Food Grains Tighten Initially, Then Relax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 52,000 shi of rice arrived in both the North and South markets. The majority of arrivals were still indica rice. In the South market, japonica rice and small-volume sales were still lively, rising by 3,500 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice temporarily lacked activity, and Bai Yin Yuan remained firm. New Pudong japonica rice continued to arrive in small quantities, with the market initially tight but later relaxed. The situation was similar. Given the clear weather, the volume of rice coming out gradually increased. The North market was initially weak but later stabilized, with no significant changes.</p>
<p>Flour prices varied slightly. Factory flour rose by 1,200 yuan due to firm sellers. Foreign flour supply was insufficient to meet demand, and sales were exceptionally strong, continuing to surge by 10,000 yuan. However, mixed-brand flour prices were stable as small flour mills in Jiangwan Dachang Nanxiang and other locations continued to supply Shanghai, and transactions were generally around 112,000 to 113,000 yuan.

<p>Soybean cake fertilizer sales were ordinary, weak, and depressed. Yingkou cake fell by 3,500 yuan. New soybeans continued to arrive from the Yangtze River, and Zhejiang continued to ship to Shanghai. New crops were seen along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line in Danyang and Lingkou. Sales were flat, prices remained unchanged, and there were few transactions in old soybeans.</p>
<h3>Registration of Trade Names: Consent Required for Certificate Issuance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received submissions from the Cigarette, Soap, and Match Trade Associations, stating that for trade names that are identical and of long standing, please order them to be additionally registered and uniformly registered, etc. After forwarding this to the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs issued an instruction stating that adding separate registrations for trade names is inconsistent with the law and therefore cannot be approved. If the establishment was established before a registered trade name with the same name and has valid certificates, it may be registered. If two or more trade names with the same name simultaneously apply for registration or are established after a registered trade name with the same name, consent must be obtained before a registration certificate can be approved. Such handling will have no impact on trade names with a long history, and both laws and ministerial interpretations can be taken into account.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendment of Guangzhou Import Control Laws to Protect Domestic Raw Material Supply and Demand and the Interests of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Executive Yuan promulgated import control laws and the Guangzhou transshipment ban, Hong Kong's commerce has been severely impacted. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in order to maintain the lifeline of overseas Chinese merchants, resolved to submit petitions to the Executive Yuan Import Control Committee, the Guangdong Office of the Suspension Control Committee, and the South China Import and Export Management Committee, requesting the revocation or improvement of the said laws. The original petition stated roughly that since the implementation of the import management laws and Guangzhou transshipment ban promulgated by the Provisional Import Management Committee of the Executive Yuan of our country, the business of overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong has been severely impacted. The Chamber convened a meeting and decided that under the principle of not harming national economic facilities, the original proposal should be revoked or the method improved, because: (1) Industrial raw materials and transportation and construction materials are urgently needed by our country at present, therefore, in order to adjust reasonable supply and demand, even in times of economic hardship, it seems appropriate to allow a moderate amount of imports. (2) The supply of food is essential to people's livelihood, and those dependent on imports are mostly in a state of insufficiency. Moderate imports seem difficult to avoid temporarily. (3) Other goods such as foreign paper, field materials, and hardware are of great importance to agriculture, industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings, which are lacking in the country. Therefore, during the reconstruction, while alleviating economic difficulties, we must also relax imports to seek urgent supplies. (4) Guangzhou does not directly trade with foreign countries, and its dependence on Hong Kong's transshipment is a geographical fact. Now, according to control laws, Hong Kong merchants have no business to operate, Guangzhou's supply is insufficient, and under the transshipment ban, various parts of South China are affected. In terms of enriching people's livelihood and fostering people's wealth, and measures to cultivate the assets of overseas Chinese, the implementation of the import ban seems to require reconsideration. (5) Furthermore, since the promulgation of the new control regulations, according to reports in the news, customs revenue has decreased significantly, and smuggling has flourished. Based on this situation, it is contrary to economic facilities, only allowing smugglers to be active, while legitimate merchants have no business to operate, which is not the government's intention to protect industry and commerce, etc.</p>
<h3>Import Control Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss How to Allocate Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Find Ways to Overcome Difficulties Technically</p>
<p>The issue of allocating import quotas for industrial raw materials has been heavily contested by industrial associations and importers. Yesterday, according to a person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, the Transport Management Committee has fulfilled its responsibility by allocating the import quota approved by the Transport Management Committee to the importers according to legal provisions. However, in order to avoid hoarding and cheating by importers, it is specifically stipulated that each importer must submit a "sales contract" before receiving the import permit, proving that the quota they imported has been sold to industrial factories and has not been hoarded and not sold by themselves. However, the industrial sector believes that this allocation is still inappropriate. The Transport Management Committee immediately requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to jointly agree on a sound allocation method, how to determine the allocation ratio, but so far the two sides have not compromised. The industrial sector still firmly demands that all imported raw materials be allocated to the industrial sector. The Transport Management Committee believes that there are two difficulties: (1) Scattered users and irregular users cannot obtain raw materials without going through merchants. (2) There are many members in the industrial sector, and it is also extremely difficult in terms of allocation technology. The wheel control committee also has no right to restrict an importer's import quota, which must be sold to a certain factory. However, the Transport Management Committee is currently renegotiating a new method, opening up new paths to solve the problem, so that both parties can obtain a reasonable allocation ratio. It is also said that so far, among all approved imported materials, the four major categories of chemical products, oils and waxes, pigments, and hardware are due to complicated and fragmented users, and the first and second phases of import quotas have not been fully allocated.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Executive Committee of the Transport Management Committee will hold a meeting in the coming days to thoroughly discuss the allocation method of industrial raw materials, find ways to overcome difficulties technically, and make rigid regulations.</p>

<p>Lawsuit Involving Debtors and Creditors Settled; Relatives Mediate Withdrawal of Appeal</p>
<p>To the Editor: I was previously involved in a lawsuit with someone over a debt and was ordered by the court to pay a bail bond of 10 million yuan. However, the other party was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Now, through the mediation of relatives, a settlement has been reached, and the other party voluntarily withdraws the lawsuit. I have several legal questions. Please advise: (1) If the other party still does not withdraw their appeal after the agreement is signed, is the settlement agreement still valid? (2) If the other party withdraws the appeal, what procedures should be followed to reclaim the funds provided as security?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) The establishment of a settlement has the same effect as a final judgment (see Article 380 of the Civil Procedure Law). Even if the settlement is out of court and not a settlement in court, if there is a witness to prove that the settlement was established, even if the other party does not withdraw the appeal, it is still valid unless there is a reason for the settlement to be invalid or revocable. (2) When the other party withdraws the appeal and the case file is returned to the first instance court, a written request can be submitted to the first instance court to reclaim the bail bond paid.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Treatment (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Shaoqing</p>
<p>(E) Things to Do</p>
<p>(1) Understanding Contagiousness The easiest way to spread tuberculosis is through sputum and saliva. Tuberculosis bacteria are transmitted to others through this medium. Therefore, people with good hygiene habits never spit everywhere. The best method is to spit sputum into a paper handkerchief and then burn it to destroy the tuberculosis bacteria completely. When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth with a handkerchief to prevent saliva from spreading.</p>
<p>(2) Daily Life and Diet Should be separated from others, especially pay attention to children in the family, and isolation should be implemented. Live alone, the room should be ventilated with air and sunlight. Tableware such as cups, chopsticks, bowls, and plates must be boiled in boiling water after each meal to prevent tuberculosis bacteria from surviving.</p>
<p>The above methods to avoid infection are easy to do, but to implement them faithfully, you must realize the danger of infection and have a public spirit of caring for others. Otherwise, you may not want to take so much trouble. If there is anything you don't understand, your doctor or public health nurse is willing to sincerely explain and assist in guidance.</p>
<p>(3) Maintain a Happy Spirit and Bed Rest For patients with active tuberculosis, no matter what treatment method they take, they must "rest" in bed. This is the basic condition for treatment, not just "rest," just not working. In order for bed rest to be effective, you must be happy in spirit and open-minded in mind, and then you can be calm and peaceful and maintain the joy of the sickbed. This is easy to say but difficult to do, but it is indeed the secret to treating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(4) Nourishing Diet Milk, eggs, cod liver oil, fish, vegetables, and fresh fruits are all nutritious foods. They should be combined and balanced, and should not be neglected. There is no so-called "triggering food," and no "dietary restrictions" are needed, as long as digestion is appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, one more thing to say is that your tuberculosis must have been contracted from someone else. Conversely, your tuberculosis may have unknowingly infected others. Regarding the former, if you suspect that you have had contact with someone who is sick, you must advise them to be checked to prevent the source of infection. Regarding the latter, you have even more responsibility and obligation to have your family members or roommates checked. If they are sick, they can be treated halfway, and if they are not sick, they can rest assured. If this is not done, the latent growth of tuberculosis will never end. During this initial tuberculosis prevention period in our country, we must find ways to break this vicious cycle. Every patient can understand this intention and work together to achieve significant results. (The End)</p>

<h3>Weariness</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Living in such an era that cannot be described with language and words, a minority of intellectuals confined to their own realm of awakening feel an immense sense of weariness.</p>
<p>It's like a faint sunlight, evasive footsteps, a hazy mist. I trudge on, drowsy and heavy-headed.</p>
<p>Endless oceans, deep forests, mountains and valleys piled high with heavy vehicles, boundless prairies, dry, boring deserts… I walk on, in such a complex environment, unable to distinguish whether I'm stepping on ocean waves or scorching grains of sand. In any case, I walk on like this—walking with extreme weariness.</p>
<p>Why do I walk this way?</p>
<p>Originally, I also had a purpose and direction, and naturally that hasn't changed now. However, due to the weariness arising from aversion to the reality before my eyes, I've finally become lost in such a state of mind that is neither deep forest nor ocean, much less desert. I, the weakest among the weak (I don't know what to call myself), can't help but resent my own cowardice. Why can't I choose a path I should take and stride forward like others? Why can't I be like those seers, clearing brambles in the wilderness, exhausting my strength clearing a way through the mountains? Instead, I allow my feet to move me, treading on ground I myself cannot make out, tottering and stumbling forward?</p>
<p>I can't see light, I am blind; I can't hear sound, I am deaf; I cannot speak the words in my heart, I am mute… only my heart has not died. Pitiful me, I can only follow the dictates of my heart and walk forward.</p>
<p>Is the direction I'm going in right after all? In my consciousness, I believe it is, because from the silent contemplation of my heart, I know those seers are not far ahead.</p>
<p>It is with this bit of solace that I strive to walk on tirelessly. If it is ocean, I will swim; if it is high mountain, I will climb; if it is desert, I will trek; if it is deep forest, I will pass through… I am bitten by rats, stung by insects, my body torn by thorns, yet I still move forward unceasingly—</p>
<p>I walk on, acting like a fool. I am mocked by friends who are not deaf, not mute, not blind; I am looked down upon by friends who know shortcuts and how to utilize every means of transport; I am slandered by clamorous friends… I do not bother to justify myself, nor do I want to justify myself. I only act as my conscience directs me, walking alone on my lonely, desolate road.</p>
<p>When I am lonely, I sing my own tuneless, guttural song; when I am perplexed, I open the books I carry on my back, in which are imprinted the footprints of seers. I grope through the leaves, reading with my heart. I believe in these raised, boundless words.</p>
<p>I admit that I am a weakling, good-for-nothing save for a kind heart. I don't want to defend myself, like those foxes who feign goodness, hanging out a sign of a philanthropist.</p>
<p>I just walk on, day and night.</p>
<p>I am hungry, exhausted, yet I do not hesitate; I am weary, enervated, yet I constantly rouse myself and encourage myself forward. I am a collection of contradictions, yet amid the turmoil of my heart, I constantly strive for unity of action, thought, and word.</p>
<p>In such an era that cannot be described with language and words, I am truly a fig tree, with all the forms and substance of a tree, with fruit, and even with an inner flower; however, I hope that my blossoms bloom in my heart, because I have no desire to be frolicked by bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The fig tree is weary of the long, hot summer. It does not use flowers to indicate the changing of the seasons. I hope I am a fig tree. May my fruit ripen in silence. From the soil, I draw nourishment at every moment. I believe that only in the soil is there nourishment that makes me grow and mature. I don't want to borrow the fragrance of others to adorn myself, nor do I want to emulate dodder, relying on a large tree to reach the clouds. I am just myself—a fig tree without sound, color, or scent.</p>
<p>I endure the weariness of life; I bear the wounds of wind and rain; though I cannot shelter tiny birds, I also do not rely on the support of forceful heroes.</p>
<p>I am good for nothing, yet I have no regrets. I produce fruit, simply transforming the sights of this human world I have witnessed into a bittersweet juice for the world to consume. Perhaps there is a traveler who cannot find a water source, cannot find melons or fruits. Then, I will not hesitate to offer a plate of bittersweet juice.</p>
<p>Though I feel weariness toward life, I have not expressed any aversion. From my evergreen leaves, it can be seen that the source of my life has not yet dried up. From the small fruit I offer, it is proven that I still have a red heart.</p>
<p>In any case, I will not adorn this world. Let the optimistic trees use colorful blossoms to adorn spring, use rich fragrance to boast of the world's beauty existing in the hopes of the future. I am just a weary fig tree that does not give up on itself. With the responsibility for survival that life has bestowed upon me, I bear fruit—</p>
<p>Yes, I currently feel deeply weary toward the state of the world. I also know that I should be like those seers of old, clearing brambles in the forest, clearing paths for those who come after. They are brave pioneers, and I admire them deeply.</p>
<p>Let me be a cautionary tale. Young friends, you should choose the road you take, the widest and most open road. You should be raindrops, gathering from streams to become a great river, breaking through dikes and flowing toward the sea…</p>
<p>Do not stop to think, and do not worry about the things around you. Remember:</p>
<p>"There was originally no road, only when someone has walked it does it become a road."</p>
<p>Remember, this is the prophecy of a seer, this is the declaration of the mystery of the bright, open path by those of great courage and wisdom.</p>
<h3>Gold and Jade Bracelets</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Sincere Words: "On the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the second year of the Jin Shengping era, E Lü Hua descended to the home of Yang Quan, presenting a poem, along with a strip of fire-washed cloth and a gold and jade bracelet each." Li Shangyin's Mid-Autumn Festival poem: "Though Yang Quan obtained a gold bracelet, Wen Jiao vainly longed for a jade mirror stand." Lu Guimeng's poem: "Cherishing the pair of jade bracelets, relying entirely on the three islands to send to Lord Yang," all use this event. According to the Complete Tang Poetry Talk: "Emperor Wenzong asked his ministers, 'An old poem says, "Light shirt sets off bracelets; what are bracelets?" The ministers did not answer, and the emperor said, "They are what we now call wrist ornaments.'"</p>
<h3>Random Notes by the Window</h3>
<p>— Dong Liu</p>
<p>"Gengzi Waiji" by Pierre Loti</p>
<p>The French novelist Pierre Loti (P. Loti) is famous in China for books such as "An Iceland Fisherman" and "Madame Chrysanthème." The former was translated by Li Liewen and included in the World Literature Library edited by Zheng Zhenduo, while the latter was translated by Xu Zhimo and published by the Commercial Press. Loti's writing style is subtle and winding, and he excels at depicting landscapes and characters. Furthermore, a unique exoticism pervades his prose-poetry-like novels. People generally know that Loti was a French naval officer who, in his spare time, engaged in literature and achieved such accomplishments, which is commendable. I once saw a photograph of him, impressively wearing a sword and sporting a Wilhelm-style mustache. His appearance was that of a proper military man, which formed a striking contrast with his beautiful writing style.</p>
<p>Loti came to China, visited Beijing, and was an officer in the Eight-Nation Alliance, also serving as a French correspondent. "Gengzi Waiji," a collection of his dispatches, is a record of his observations of Beijing in those years.</p>
<p>He witnessed the Boxer Rebellion and adopted, to some extent, a conqueror's stance, holding some reservations about the German commander Waldersee. His book "Gengzi Waiji" contains many noteworthy historical materials. The following is a short passage in which he recorded the chaotic situation inside and outside Beijing:</p>
<p>'On the pergola of a garden, morning glories were still blooming, and beneath it lay the corpse of a woman. Dusk had already arrived, but the flowers on the pergola still reflected the woman's corpse, thoroughly but elegantly decayed.'</p>
<p>'On the floor lay a wooden bucket, and something seemed to be extending out of it. As I approached it, I was startled and jumped back. It turned out to be the thigh of a woman, the flesh stripped away. Where was the rest of the body? Who knows what people had done with it? Ah, yes, the head was in the house, rolling together with a child's toy under a chair, completely blackened. Amidst the long, disheveled hair, we could only see the white teeth protruding from the mouth.'</p>
<p>This can be said to be the most poetic realism. Who would have thought that the great tragedy of the Chinese people, once in the hands of a foreign novelist, would become excellent material for prose poems? —"Thoroughly but elegantly decayed"—reading this sentence cannot help but make one feel a bit nauseous.</p>
<p>Wang Guowei and the Sandwich</p>
<p>Wang Guowei can be considered a scholar of his generation. According to Guo Moruo, his tragic suicide by drowning was bestowed upon him by his benefactor and enemy, Luo Zhenyu. Lu Xun mentioned Wang Guowei in his essay "On the So-Called Archives of the Great Within," using a very clever metaphor:</p>
<p>'Wang Guowei had already ended his reclusive life in the water, an honest man, but his sighs often echoed those of Luo Zhenyu, although there was a distinction between truth and falsehood in what they said. Therefore, it was common for him to be made into a sandwich filled with advertisements, because he was always so full of burning passions.'</p>
<p>To say that Wang Guowei was the filling of an advertising sandwich is indeed thought-provoking, but once you understand it, it feels very apt. The exaggeration of the jewel-like quality of the "Archives of the Great Within" by people like Luo Zhenyu was aimed at making more money. Wang Guowei, unaware of the details, followed Luo Zhenyu's tune. Since the academic community still had some faith in Wang Guowei, it was natural, in the eyes of Luo Zhenyu and his ilk, for him to become a "sandwich" in their advertisements.</p>
<p>Half Hermit, Half Traitor</p>
<p>I saw a short article mentioning old stories about Zhou Zuoren:</p>
<p>Zhou Zuoren once said: "Life is not an easy thing. Living like an animal, naturally and simply, is one way; treating life as an art, living subtly and beautifully, is another way; there is no other path besides these two. What exists otherwise is a chaotic life below that of animals." ("The Art of Living")</p>
<p>He advocated living subtly: "Half hermit, half traitor."</p>
<p>Rebel when you can rebel; hide when you can hide. When rebelling, carry the seeds of hiding; when hiding, carry the fruits of rebellion. Before a traitor, he is a hermit; before a hermit, he is a traitor. Hiding and rebelling are done in moderation, rebelling and hiding are mutually supportive.</p>
<p>For whom do you rebel? For whom do you hide? Answer: the master.</p>
<p>——This passage is truly a good piece that touches upon Zhou Zuoren's inner secrets.</p>
<p>And I am reminded of the "goat with bells" mentioned by Lu Xun, and also of that terrifying beast that is "a sheep among wolves, and a wolf among sheep."</p>
<h3>Summer Night Sketches</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Rainy Night</p>
<p>The night in the suburbs is lonely and melancholy.</p>
<p>Here, there are no dazzling neon lights, no cars rushing like dragons; the hustle and bustle of the city cannot reach this place. Everything seems to have subsided after a sound of disappointment after excessive fatigue. It is so desolate and sad!</p>
<p>In the past, I loved watching the summer dusk, going alone to the wheat fields, wandering aimlessly around the narrow paths; sometimes standing on a dirt pile in the field, gazing at the twilight colors that adorned the sky. Although the sunset glow was fleeting, was not this momentary brilliance a beautiful embroidery in a land full of disasters?</p>
<p>When dusk reached its end, and shadows ruled this open space, I would return from outside, passing through a dark road. The light in front of the gate was lit, and I looked down at my cold, clear shadow and walked into the house.</p>
<p>Tonight, it is raining heavily outside, and I cannot go to the fields again. The rain, carried by the wild wind, unleashed its power wantonly. The downpour struck my window, the ceaseless cracking and slapping sounds as if to shatter the peace of my small room. In fact, our simple, small house has never had peace, as news of sudden changes arrives at any time. Just now, after a companion came for a chat, the sounds of sighing and lamenting still lingered around, like a series of incessant painful groans, frightening and making me tremble… These shapeless feelings have never allowed me a moment of peace!</p>
<p>The rain is getting heavier and heavier! Outside the house is a mass of darkness, with terror following behind. Several flying insects, driven by the wind and rain, fluttered in through the broken window. I stared blankly at their wings covered in raindrops, flying around the light. These small lives must be struggling towards the light in the midst of hardship, right?</p>
<p>A fierce burst of heavy rain swept over from the foreign wheat fields; I was still watching the flying insects, and my momentarily dazed and silent heart, struck by this burst of heavy rain, suddenly jumped up again.</p>
<p>The electric light went out suddenly for some reason. It was already very late, but I did not want to go to sleep. I lit a small white candle, its flickering flame increasing the atmosphere of terror in the room. Yet what was I still afraid of? Since suffering has already struck, I want to see clearly this terrifying rainy night, so that when it clears up tomorrow, I can better appreciate the clouds in the distant sky.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Zhou Huaimin</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 366</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>To be fair, Yaoqun's misunderstanding was not entirely a misunderstanding. Only I could see this most clearly, and besides me, Mr. W, with his discerning eyes, could also see eight or nine parts of it. To allow himself and Yaoqun to concentrate on their work, Tsurumi tried his best to suppress his emotions. Furthermore, fearing that his emotions might not be so easily suppressed, he used a clumsy, Japanese-education-style method, adopting a current-insulation approach, avoiding working with Yaoqun as much as possible.</p>
<p>However, Yaoqun, this daughter of the Northeast, had a straightforward and honest personality. In her letter to Tsurumi, she made it clear: work is work, emotions are emotions, and everything should develop naturally. One cannot neglect food because of choking, thus delaying the work. However, Tsurumi stubbornly stuck to his position.</p>
<p>But no matter how straightforward and honest Yaoqun was, she was not a superhuman. She could not completely eliminate the original nature of a daughter and the small or large weakness inherent in women—jealousy—to zero. Therefore, as soon as Pingzi appeared, and as soon as she saw Tsurumi obediently (?), at Pingzi's command, even if Yaoqun were a superhuman, she would probably feel some resentment. Especially since she originally felt grateful and understood by Tsurumi.</p>
<p>Excessively suppressing emotions is not a good thing. The result is either extreme negativity, or a great and cunning person hiding evil, playing tricks, or being artificially pretentious; or it can trigger a formula of reversal, allowing the emotion that has been suppressed beyond measure to burst forth like the Yellow River breaching its banks, gushing and flowing freely, to the point of becoming cynical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yaoqun was able to control herself. She did not choose these vulgar paths; on the contrary, she concentrated on expanding the original work plan. Then, after Tsurumi and Pingzi set off, she and Little Tiger, taking the "Military Permit" that I had obtained for them, suddenly departed for the outside of Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>At this time, transportation out of Shanhaiguan was certainly not as smooth as usual, but with someone as intelligent and resourceful as Yaoqun, and with a great purpose in mind, they naturally traveled safely along the way. They did not cause trouble, nor did anything happen to them. As for Little Tiger, with Yaoqun restraining him along the way, it was not easy to meddle in other people's affairs, even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Moreover, Little Tiger also harbored a great idea of gratification on this trip back to his old stronghold. He thought, he left Shanhaiguan as a commoner, just a small potato of an ordinary big-eared peasant; he didn't even have the qualification of a "peasant" in the broad sense, because he was only twelve or thirteen years old, still a long way from adulthood. But this time he was returning to his old stronghold, and in just two or three weeks, he had officially received the rank of second lieutenant, albeit half-baked. But he was still an official, no matter how small. Being an official, in his imagination, there had to be some concrete glimpses of "returning home in glory" during the process of returning to his old stronghold, floating around in the front or back of his mind.</p>
<p>If you were with Little Tiger at this time, sitting in that improved second-class passenger car (actually, it was a fourth-class "stuffy" car—the true top three classes were not for "Chinese" people), you would see that Little Tiger was particularly polite, surprisingly well-behaved, and always had a smiling face when he spoke. The temper of glaring at people was nowhere to be seen at this time. The pair of skinny hands with special magic, which could cause death upon contact, now extended out, were also particularly gentle and soft, like the paws of a cat hiding its steel claws. Walking a few steps, he was no longer so reckless, but rather very gentle and refined. In short, he realized that he was an "official," and could not be so wild and rash.</p>
<h3>Living Education</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>If school is dead education, then society is living education. A student who throws away textbooks and opens the first page of "society" must find it difficult and bitter, much harder than school.</p>
<p>Many people who leave school often feel very resentful. The gatekeeper style and bureaucratic airs of those institutions often shatter their "vigorous spirit."</p>
<p>Those who are good at flattery may not think "adulation" is a big deal, and they will slowly get on the road, understand hypocrisy, learn to be "slick and round," learn to read faces and change color, and learn all the bad habits of society.</p>
<p>Only those who have been baptized in society for a long time can earn the reputation of being "experienced." These two words include a lot of boasting, and also include the "devaluation" of a lot of "private morality."</p>
<p>"Pure innocence" is often dismissed as "ignorance" in this society, while a person who knows how to follow the lead of those in power is considered "sophisticated" and "experienced."</p>
<p>This colorful society leads you by the nose, takes you to the abyss, and leads you to evil.</p>
<p>A college student and a middle school student degenerate into bandits (see the August 3rd edition of this newspaper). This is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>But how can this "living education" not lead pure and innocent students astray, not lead them into the abyss, and not lead them to evil?</p>
<p>This responsibility lies in the society itself, which applies "living education."</p>

<h3>"Flying Saucers" and Kite Reflectors - This Is Not a Mystery</h3>
<p>— Xu Mingmo</p>
<p>The "flying saucer mystery" has ended without a resolution, leaving only a faint echo. "Ignore the strange, and the strange will disappear." All the unease and terror were merely the worries of common people. Many people, after their nerves returned to normal, cannot help but smile wryly.</p>
<p>However, what exactly are flying saucers? This mystery has never been solved. The existence of flying saucers is undeniable. People all over the world have seen them with their own eyes, and it cannot be dismissed as unfounded rumor. To deny this fact outright is tantamount to trying to cover up the truth with one hand, and the result is futile. We also do not advocate closing our ears and eyes, ignoring everything, like ostriches burying their heads in the sand. After the flying saucers have passed, we stick our heads out again, look at the sky, and feel very comforted.</p>
<p>What exactly are flying saucers? This question does not cease to exist with the disappearance of the flying saucer scare. The spirit of science lies in "pursuing knowledge through investigation." We must "investigate" even the smallest things, such as a speck of dust, or invisible things, such as a bacterium. How much more should we investigate these flying monsters in the sky? If the flying saucer mystery is not solved, we cannot rest easy. The so-called "shame of not knowing one thing" cannot tolerate the existence of "monsters" in today's scientific age. This is a disgrace to science.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, this reporter has put in a lot of thought into flying saucers, but has never been able to get a satisfactory explanation. Recently, I accidentally found some clues in an American magazine called "Science News Letter." This is a short news item with the title:</p>
<p>Aluminum Kite Reflector is used for Radar Target</p>
<p>"Aluminum kite reflector used as radar test target."</p>
<p>The news says that the research department of the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States has recently invented an aluminum kite-style reflector, which is used as a test target for anti-aircraft artillery radar sights. This is a box-shaped "kite," attached to a small balloon with a rope, and then the balloon is raised to a height of five hundred feet in the air, and fixed with a cable. This kind of kite target is then used for anti-aircraft artillery aiming and shooting tests. If the test is successful, it will be replaced by a real aircraft. Aluminum is the best reflective material for radar microwaves...</p>
<p>This short news item is enough to help us solve the mysterious mystery of flying saucers—flying saucers are not mysterious things, flying saucers are exactly this kind of "aluminum kite reflector." Let's imagine this: in a large-scale radar aiming test in the United States (or the Soviet Union, or the United Kingdom) (not necessarily for anti-aircraft artillery shooting, perhaps other secret special tests, because radar has many wonderful uses, and can now be used to detect rain clouds in the distant sky, or even a flock of birds), one or several balloons suddenly break their tethers and fly away with the wind. They gradually rise into the high altitude (hundreds or thousands of miles high), dragging a large group of aluminum kite reflectors. Finally, due to the air being too thin outside, they burst. Then, this batch of "kites" float down, drifting to every corner of the world...</p>
<p>This explanation is reasonable and rational. From this, it can be seen that "flying saucers" are actually ordinary things; although novel, they are not mysterious. As for why no responsible authority made a concrete statement after the flying saucers were discovered, this is due to military secrets. Anything related to military secrets, no matter how big or small, they never want to publicize it. If this secret is Soviet, separated by an Iron Curtain, not a single word will be revealed. General LeMay of the United States broadcast that flying saucers are a kind of high-altitude measuring meteorological instrument, which is obviously just deception. (According to Chengdu Telegraph, "flying saucers" were discovered in the suburbs of Chengdu, and were identified by professors of Sichuan University as high-altitude meteorological instruments. From what is described in the telegram, we can determine that these "flying saucers" are not the flying saucers that people have reportedly seen.)</p>
<p>Perhaps curious people will be disappointed when the secret of "flying saucers" is revealed. However, "science" truly tells us that flying saucers cannot become terrifying weapons. It must be known that although science can create great miracles, science can never create something out of nothing, nor can it create "monsters" that no one can guess. The most powerful weapons used by modern people, such as poison gas, bacteria, and atomic bombs, are not "monsters" created out of nothing. Humans have been using poison gas in warfare for at least five hundred years, and research on biological warfare has been going on for at least twenty years. The atomic bomb began to be manufactured five years before it exploded, and people foresaw it ten years ago. Within an hour after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, the Japanese government knew what it was. Now, a "flying saucer" has been flying for more than ten days, and we still cannot figure out what kind of terrifying possibility it has, which shows that "flying saucers" are not to be feared.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of this aerial monster "flying saucer," I do not know how many people's mental peace has been disturbed, and how much unnecessary fear and anxiety has been aroused. It is truly a cursed nightmare of the era! The mischief played by this disaster-causing balloon is enough for the world. We now hope to fully publicize the truth about "flying saucers," so that this over-stressed and exhausted world can regain—freedom from fear.</p>
<h3>What is One US Dollar Worth?</h3>
<p>— Wu Zheng</p>
<p>According to the latest regulations of various governments, one US dollar can be exchanged for four shillings in the UK, 107 francs in France, 2.6 guilders in the Netherlands, 4.77 Danish krone in Denmark, 3.2 Indian rupees in India, 25 Egyptian pounds in Egypt, 5,000 drachmas in Greece, and 600 lira in Italy. It is even more valuable in China, with an official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Atomic City (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Binzhi</p>
<p>— Tannu Uriankhai</p>
<p>The study of atomic energy has aroused the interest of scientists all over the world. Of course, Soviet scientists are no exception. But this large-scale research requires precise laboratories, centralized factories, and even an entire city to be used for atomic energy research. Where is the Soviet atomic energy research center? This is a mysterious riddle. Because Soviet magazines and newspapers are strictly censored, and government reports never mention any information about atomic energy, even the word "uranium" cannot be seen in geological survey reports.</p>
<p>Based on various facts, Tannu Uriankhai is very likely to have become the Soviet atomic city. Tannu Uriankhai was originally a piece of land on the border of China's Outer Mongolia. In 1921, it declared independence from China and immediately joined the embrace of the Soviet Union. Later, the Soviet Union openly annexed it. Although China made a weak protest, what was the use?</p>
<p>There are reasons why Tannu Uriankhai was chosen as an atomic city. It is a vast valley located between two high mountains, which ordinary aircraft cannot fly over. The neighboring areas are also separated by a dozen large and small peaks, forming an isolated zone. The terrain there is not simple, which is a good place to build fortresses. At the same time, the continuous forests and deep rock caves can avoid enemy aircraft's reconnaissance vision.</p>
<p>The climate there does not change much with the seasons, and the soil is suitable for planting, which can produce a large number of crops. Countless cattle, sheep, horses, camels, etc. live on the vast grasslands. Although it is a desert area, the water source is very abundant. The lakes are full of游魚, and the rivers are navigable, and hydroelectric stations can be established everywhere. The high cliffs on both sides are natural hiding places. Countless minerals are buried underground: gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, platinum, tin, radium, manganese, asbestos, lingmu stone, yang lead, diamonds, clay, etc. Coalfields exposed on the surface are everywhere. These are indispensable materials for the research of atomic energy. Tannu Uriankhai has such rich resources, which not only can be self-sufficient, but also can supply a large number of troops, so it can be isolated from the outside world and secretly engage in atomic research.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shutuan</p>
<p>American Military Police and Police</p>
<p>Although military police and police are armed comrades, their duties are completely different. They respect each other and do not infringe on each other's jurisdiction. Because military police only manage military discipline, the police have a very large scope of authority, maintaining public order and security. Therefore, there are military police where there are soldiers in the United States, and soldiers are not allowed to leave the camp without a pass. Soldiers with passes are not allowed to carry weapons outside the camp. Military police on duty are issued handguns by the government, but they do not easily use them. In my five years in the United States, I have not read about military police or police practicing target shooting in the downtown area, nor have I heard of the strange story of accidental firing. Weapons simply do not have such a thing as accidental firing. The so-called accidental firing refers to a malfunction in the machine gun mechanism, where the bullets cannot be controlled when firing, and what was originally intended to be a short burst of three rounds ends up firing all the rounds. American military police are not an independent branch of the military, but are attached to each branch of the military. For example, at an Air Force officer school, officers and soldiers take turns serving as military police. Each person on duty is issued a handgun and an armband with MP written on it (SP for the Navy). Soldiers wear white steel helmets and khaki leggings, while officers do not. They specialize in inspecting whether soldiers of their own army are drunk and causing trouble in nightclubs and bars, mostly by means of persuasion, and there is no need to use force at all. Military police do not inspect theaters. There is no such thing as watching free shows in the United States. This does not mean that American soldiers do not watch plays, but rather that they never watch free shows. Because there are ready-made theaters in the military camps, and each ticket costs only 15 cents. Even if a lowly Private gets a monthly salary of $50 and watches a movie every day, it only costs $4.50 a month, which is negligible. Civilian-run cinemas in the city have two types of prices, regardless of seating. There is one price for adults, averaging 70 cents, and a discounted price for children and soldiers, about 75% off. Officers are not entitled to this kind of discount. In order to maintain their status, officers will definitely not infringe on the rights of soldiers, and would rather buy a full-price ticket or simply not watch. Military personnel receive discounts on trains and buses, but not on trams. The number of police is extremely small. In small cities, you simply cannot see police, because traffic is controlled by automatic traffic lights. Moreover, most police wear plain clothes, and their handguns are mostly hidden in their clothes, never hanging on their bodies for show. But when they open fire, they are always accurate. They cannot become police without practicing target shooting thousands of times. When they arrest thieves, they never shoot them dead, but are only allowed to hit non-lethal areas such as the legs, only to prevent their escape. When capturing major thieves, at most four or five people are dispatched, and there is no need for a large number of people. The strength lies in quality, not quantity. If the educational level of the police and military police can be improved, the number of people reduced, and the treatment adjusted, the efficiency of protecting the country and the people can definitely be increased, and the common people can also be threatened less.
