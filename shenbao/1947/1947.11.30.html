<h3>對日和會蘇方建議　我當局正考慮中　菲島將要求在碧瑤舉行</h3>

<p>〔中央社馬尼刺廿九日合衆電〕馬尼刺紀事報謂：可靠方面消息，菲律賓現要求未來之對日和會在碧瑤舉行。</p>
<p>〔中央社電梨廿九日電〕雪梨晨驅報今日社論稱：莫洛托夫所提於明年一月舉行外長會議，準備對日和約之建議，恐不能獲得若干支持。因外長會議之其他國家，已接受由進東委會十一個國家非由五强制定和約之原則也。</p>
<h3>草擬總統府組織法　國府文官處愼重辦理中立委提名事三黨續會商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國大即將揭幕，行憲在邇，國府文官處頃正着手草擬總統府組織法，唯以我國史無前例，在草擬時不無缺乏籃本參考之苦，故經辦人負對此均極愼重。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國務會議通過立委選舉延期一月後，其影響所及，厥惟對憲法之不符合處，因憲法規定在國大閉幕後一月內必須成立立院，今立委選塲即須至一月十日，故勢必觸違憲法，若干人士對此正密切注意中。權威人士認爲，國大延期亦爲違憲之一舉，故可能如期舉行開幕式，然後舉行大會。同時目前選舉結果尙未知悉，如選出代表不滿二分之一，則常然不能開會，自亦不能謂爲違憲。民社黨徐傳霖稱：惟此一切當看當時情形始能決定。另據某觀察家稱：如國大如期舉行，而立院尙未成立，則行政院院長雖經總統任命，而無立院同意，仍不能改組成立，故可能以「看守政府」出現，以維持此過渡時期，但此種制度僅能在不得已之情勢下始行之，中國是否必須迫至如此情勢，而非以看守政府出之不可，現尙未定局。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕政黨提名立委候選人名單，廿九日年後國民黨人士續邀民，靑兩黨人士會商，其主旨仍在人選，地區之配合，聞未獲結果。同時商討者尙有民·靑兩黨參加地方民意機構問題，經討論後，業獲解決。又悉：民社黨楊浚明廿九日晨訪政院秘書長甘乃光，對前由雷震送交之參議員名單，請政院能提早付院會討論，然後交國務會議備案，俾能及早辦理院委之選舉。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕國民黨中常會暨選舉指導會分組審査三黨立委候選人名單工作，再度吿一段落，廿九日僅第三組開會，據悉：民·靑兩黨之名單中，因發現在若干地區共同提名，雖經連日開會設法予以安排，但有卅餘人仍因事實上之組織，無法分配，三黨九人小組會議，廿九日下午五時假國民黨中央黨部總讀開會，商討尋求解決途徑。</p>
<h3>選票保存問題選總決定辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電」關於國代選舉票，經開票結果後應如何保存問題，總舉應事務所頃決定辦法如下：「凡有關國大代表選舉之投票簿，開票筆錄，須繕寫副本，以備選舉人或被選舉人請求閱覽，其正本應保存六年，至選舉票之保存，除因選舉訴訟而須訴訟判泱後再行銷燬外，其餘選票，均須主管選舉機關保存至國大召開六個月後始得銷燬」</p>
<h3>國代當選證書選總愼重發給</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國大代表當選證書，將俟各地選舉開票結果報吿選總後，由選總核對無訛，始能發給。選總對此項手續極爲愼重，故日內即將通令全國各地選所遵辦。</p>
<h3>國代立委選罷法施行條例有補充</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院今通過國代立委選罷法施行條例第六條原文之後各增列一項案，使去歲參加制憲大會之各種職業團體從業人，均得參加本年大選。該項從業人員中包括敎育，技師，特種工人等。茲誌兩條例第六條之修正條文如次：</p>
<p>修正國民大會代表選舉罷免法施行條例第六條條文草案；　第六條　參加選舉之職業團體及婦女團體，以曾經依法向其主管機關立案者爲限，但曾經參加制定憲法之國民大會代表選舉各業之從業人，如其團體未完成立案手讀者，得由各主管機關依法審查資格，編造名册呈准參加選舉。</p>
<p>修正立法院立法委員選舉罷免法施行條例第六條條文草案：　第六條　參加選舉之職業團體，以曾經依法向其主管機關立案者爲限，但曾經參加制定憲法之國民大會代表選舉各業之從業人，如其團體未完成立案手續者得由各主管機關依法審查資格編造名冊，呈准參加選舉。</p>
<h3>本屆立院將結束　下月內每週舉行例會清理積案　昨會議通過要案十一項</h3>

<h3>建國特別捐條例　立院促政院從速擬定</h3>

<h3>黃金外幣買賣處罰條例修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院今晨通過之修正黃金外幣買賣處罰條例案，係財部鑒於原條例規定，凡携帶外幣入境者應於入境之日向當地中央銀行或其委託之兌換處所兌領國幣，隱匿不報者沒收。是對於外幣進口，不論數目多少，均在禁止之列，執行時頗多困哪，尤以歸國華僑爲甚，故請修正爲中外人民入境，准擁帶美金一百元或同値之他國幣券，超過限額者應自動向海關登記，於入境日向當地中央銀行或其委託之兌換處所兌領國幣。該案經政院咨送立院，由刑法·財政·經濟·三委員會審查，咸以若干華僑返國辦事，所携外幣或黃金，如令其兌成法幣，再度出國時即無法兌回，因決定除入國境或過國境者，均准隨身携帶黃金每人以十兩爲限，外幣每人以美金一百元爲限，逾額部份，入境者應依市價向央行兌換國幣，過境者得繳由海關代爲保存一定期限（原擬二個月）於出國時領回，逾期即須向央行兌換國幣。今日在立院討論時，各立委曾發表若干意見，有認爲二個月限期過短者，有認爲此項辦法規定過嚴者。陳茹玄並認爲外匯黑市與牌價不能平衡，此種限制，絕難生效。最後仍照三委會審査修正之條例，略予修正，即行通過。惟過境者所携外幣黃金向海關繳請保存，於出國前領回之期限，決自二個月延至六個月，當經一致通過。（條文刋二版左角）</p>

<h3>挽救當前嚴重危機的緊急建議</h3>
<p>— 杜佐周</p>
<p>戰亂蔓延，民生塗炭，經濟日濕破　，社會從根動搖。我們祇要稍留心各地的情況，幾於無處不充滿著「民不聊生，怨聲載道」的現象。如何弭救當前嚴重的危機？如何挽回這一漸近土　魚爛的整個局面？大家固然已注意到我們內部須有一番大改革；但此　改革應從何處著手，尤其是　得我們研究的大問題。</p>
<p>歷史的經驗告訴我們：一個國家的治亂安危，往往和她政治的　污和人民的生活有關。朝遠大處看，造成今日國家不安局面的基本原因，固然可以說是一個政治問題，尤其是一個人民生活問題；而就今後的　事言，除了政治連上軌道，經濟恢復常態，尤其著重人民生活的改善外，也幾乎可說別無有效的簡捷途徑。</p>
<p>然而且慢說改善人民生活這樣的大問題吧；在今天，老百姓固然多數活不下去，就是奉行國家政令工作的公敎人員，又有幾個能活得下去？今天政治上一個最不合理的現象，莫如公敎人員的畸形的　給待遇。這一不合理待遇，嚴重地影響政治本身——貪污橫行，效奉低落。故欲談政治改革，第一要從改善公敎人員的待遇著手。不然，任何澄清吏治，提高政治效率的高調，都是「緣木求魚」；任何建設計劃和締造現代化國家的理想，更屬空中樓閣。</p>
<p>看人認爲今天是總動員時期，戰爭一日不停，國家即一日無法建設，經濟狀況即一日無法改善，因而一般人民，特別是公敎人員，在這時多吃點苦，是應該的。這種說法，似是而非。要知道：（一）政治經濟的有辦法，一般國民生活的改善，是保障軍事勝利的唯一前提；（二）人民和公敎人員在戰時節衣縮食，貢獻國家，是一回事，而要求最低限度生活的保障，又是另一回事，絕不能混爲一談。</p>
<p>就公敎人員的情形講，今日的問題，已不是吃苦不吃苦的問題，而是根本無法生活下去的問題。物價指數早高漲到戰前的八九萬倍，而公敎人員待遇，在十月份未調整前，還不過四五千倍；這無異強迫全國公敎人員以幾千倍的薪速度著幾萬倍高昂的生活。即算大家本著「志士不忘在滿　」的精神，自己束緊褲帶，　腹從公，然而回到家裏，總不忍見妻子的啼　號寒。因此，好的公敎人員就祇好設法兼職妝薪，聊資彌補；次都兼商投機，自找生路；下者營私舞弊，更是司空見慣；而大多數則困坐　城，一籌莫展！因此，在生活滿壓下，我們祇看見大多數公敎人員在一天一天地消沉頽喪下去，影響工作效能的減低；而少數不曾之裁，則貪賊枉法，寡廉鮮恥，助長社會風氣的敗壞。這樣，要講政治上軌適，眞如夢想一樣！</p>
<p>再則，公敎人員的吃苦，本可毫無怨言。但應上下一致，聞其共苦，所謂「不患寡而患均」，使不致有心理上的「不平則鳴」。可是今天各機關待遇的不一律，可說「不均」「不平」之　。試想：一個中央簡任官的全部所得不及一個銀行的練習生；一個高級將官不如一個國營業業的工役；而一個大學敎授的收入，甚至也趕不上一個三輪車夫；其他還有甚麽話說？又試想：當一般公敎人員正處在所謂「生不得，病不得，活不得，死不得」的慘狀下，而一班達官顯宦，豪門顯胄，又是過的怎樣的生活？他們的錢是從那裏來的？國家窮到這樣，而有人在儘量度薪驕奢淫佚超過現代的享受。待遇如此不平，苦樂如此不均，要獨　普通公敎人員刻苦忍耐，　效國家，這如何能得事理之平？又如何能振奮工作人員的情緒，提高政令推行的效率？</p>
<p>這個畸形的薪給待遇問題，今天已決不是三個月調整一次所可解決。誠然，政府在當其他預算每不輕易准予增加之際，獨對調整公敎人員待遇一再追加預算，我們應該深切體諒政府的苦衷；可是調整的數字較之物價因受刺激而上漲的速度，顯然是追塵莫及。事實上倒變成了調整一次，待遇又降低一次。龜兔賽跑，還可望兔子停睡一回兒，烏龜慢慢爬上去；可是物價的直綫上升，以今日薪給倍數和實際生活指數的長遠距離，就是把三個月改爲一個月調整一次，恐怕也不見得是辦法。所以公敎人員對每次那點名增實減的淺淺調整數字，痛定思痛，非惟不感到興趣，而祇有愈學悲哀了！可是，現在的當軸又幾曾設想到這些？</p>
<p>再看一般社會情形，我們面臨的既是一個經濟總崩潰的危機，舉國上下應如何一致刻苦努力，共渡難關？實際上今天整個國民經濟生活已陷入極端紛亂矛盾的狀態；政治上的因循敷衍，再沒有比在經濟政策上的表現更明白了，簡約運動的口號響澈雲霄，但靠這種勸告式的敎條，以爲就會轉移月前普遍於社會上的那種奢靡浪費的風氣，那眞是幻想。惡性的通貨膨脹，罪惡的貧污與走私舞弊的商　行爲，早加深了社會財富分配的不均。現在已成功這樣一種情形：有錢的人因錢太多了，除投機囤積外，就祇有亂花一頓；而無錢的人卻祇好　學醫泣，轉輾　　！國家在天天叫窮，而一看都市的表面，卻又顯得太闊。就上海言，娛樂塲所，酒店飯館，那家不是座上客堂滿，一席數百萬？那家西裝店，不是幾百千萬一套的衣服早有人定做？汽車風馳電掣，滿坑滿谷，未必都因公務忙碌；各工廠因停電減產，勢逼關門，而通術大路何處不是霓虹當采照　奪目？無衣無食的難民一天一天地　　到黃浦邊，「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」，正形成了一個悽慘的對照！總之，在這裏，種種浪漫揮霍窮奢極慾的怪現象，恐怕住在紐約倫敦的人也決不曾想像得到。今日市面上的繁榮景氣，不是靠生產有辦法，而是靠一種不合理的分配與消費來掙持；不是靠國民生活的向上，而是靠一種極腐敗糜爛的生活和奢侈墮落的風氣來點綴。「火山上的跳舞」，這種情形還眞能維持長久嗎？</p>
<p>我們要嚴正指出：這種都市腐敗糜爛的生活，奢侈墮落的風氣，正是我國家民族最大的危機；而這種生活和風氣的養成，說得澈底些，也還是一個政治效率與經濟制度的問題。換句話說，正因社會上存在著一批貪污投機的　富者，社會上纔自然會有這種種奢侈糜爛的生活與風氣。前者是因，而後者是果。我們要取締奢侈糜爛的生活，就先要撲滅貪污投機的機會，而不能不速從經濟政策上來個大刀闊斧的緊急措施。空喚節約，徒勞無功，而反爲這批貪污投機過慣奢侈糜爛生活的腐敗份子所竊笑！</p>
<p>根據上述政治上社會上兩大矛盾現象，也就是當前一切危機的總根源，筆者主張政府對症下藥，立刻實施下面幾個辦法：</p>
<p>第一，在政治改革上的正本清源之計，應首先保障公敎人員生活，改善其待遇，廢除三個月調整一次的老辦法，而採行最近立法院通過的按照生活費指數計算俸給的規定，使每個人可以預知他以後的收入，不過份受物價波動的威脅。這樣辦，有兩大好處：　「俸」本所以「養廉」，既可「養廉」，則執法以繩貪污，收效自較容易。　公敎人員得免除衣食凍餒之虞，也消除了因待遇不均的胸中積怨和不平，纔能望他安心工作，發揮效率。總之，要政治清明，效率增強，都非實行指數計薪，改善公敎人員待遇不可。這是改革政治的先決條件。（下接第三版）</p>

<h3>覓取對德和約方案　四外長迄無協議　蘇聯堅決反對薩爾倂法　德統一問題將爲今後會議討論焦點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教廿九日廣播：四强外長會議今日舉行第五次會議。親歇爾國務卿決定設法使有關議程之討論繼續進行，而置蘇方所提儘早成立德國中央政府之建議於不　。關於蘇方指責英美企圖在德國西部單獨成立政府一點，預料馬歡爾不致提出答覆。今日之議程中，仍以德和約問題爲主，衆信莫洛托夫將繼續以在德國成立中央政府以前無法召開和會爲詞，力事阻撓。至於對奧條約，僅有德國在奧境資產以項問題，未獲解決，　國代表贊成法昇長皮杜爾所提之折衷方案，即以戰前顯屬德人所有之資產，充作賠償，並由奧國以一　美元付予蘇聯，　使對奧　的得　早日草成是也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕四強外長會議今日仍未能就法國所提設立兩專家委會，以審査德國東西疆界之議成立協議。外長會議今日已進入會議中之最緊張階段，開始討論德國之統一或分裂問題，而莫洛托夫仍堅決拒絕承認薩兩區併入法國之原則。會議竟日，雖未就任何問題成立協議，然馬歇爾貝文及皮杜爾却已耗去許多時間，向莫洛托夫釋明彼等仍贊成　國之有中央政府，並鄭重聲明彼等並不具有在西德另立政府之任何計劃。莫洛托夫則列舉西方國東政治家之言，以證確有此種計劃之有在。渠力言蘇聯政府反對任何此等計劃，並認外長會議應解明支持德中央政府之建立。貝文當答以英國從未正式表示支持設立區政府之意，而英代表團亦準備盡力覓取諒解。渠並曰英國當繼續努力建立德國中央政府，但快非獨裁制度的政府。貝文繼曰，四强如不獲協議，英國將取何種行動，雖尙未曾決定，無論如何英國當繼續設法完成德國之經濟統一，如不幸而和約卒不獲協議，則於西歐紊亂狀態之下，莫國決不能　視·貝文並力言，由一强統治德國足以引起戰爭，而均勢理論亦將引起不良後果。</p>
<h3>設立疆界委員會英提出建議四點</h3>
<p>貝文網乃述及關於設立疆界委員會事之意見，提出四點建議：　四外長代表組一個或數個盟委會，審査德鄰邦對德國之土地要求；　此等委會由四强代表會同德鄰邦盟國，或曾派軍隊參加對德戰爭諸盟國，戰對於該土地要求有直接利益之國之代表若干人組成之；　此等委會得從事必要之調査，以決定土地要求對於德國之影響，向下屆外長會提川報吿；　此一建嚴須俟本屆外長會所討論各基本問題獲得協議後，始能實行。馬歇爾與皮杜爾對於此一建議，除對第四項聲明保留外，餘均表示接受。莫洛托夫則曰，疆界問題目前尙不能討論。莫洛托夫於述及德中央政府之問題時，會力言無中央政府，即無和約可訂，若他區有自立政府之計劃，即可證明他國無獲致協關之意。馬歇爾當答以當英美區合倂時，獎國已建議他區之共同合作，故統一之途已綁打開，今祗須他方採取行動。皮杜爾則以莫洛托夫不願答　皮氏之薩爾問題，亦拒絕答覆莫洛托夫之比一問題。</p>
<h3>奧亟需復興　葛魯勃發出呼籲</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕奧外長葛魯勃今日在此間英奧商會之午餐席上致辭，力請外長會議終止奧國之佔領狀態。渠云，奧國被解放及被佔領已有三年，猶如一車之有四煞車，一煞軍稍緊，即足阻止奧國之復與。渠並曰，奧國若能收回油田，即可使其經濟改觀。</p>
<h3>盟國賠償會要求　增加德工廠數額充賠償</h3>

<h3>蘇試驗原子彈消息　遣歸日俘證明不確</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日電〕據讀賣新聞消息：前法國報戴蘇聯於本年六月十五日在伊爾庫次克試騐原子彈之消息，刻有最近由該地遺歸之二日人予以否認。據該報駐京記者稱：渠等自投降後即被拘於伊兩庫次克，但在本年六月十五日並未如法報所傳有可怕之爆炸火光及震動發生，且未聞有舉行此項試騐之說。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕參院本日休會，下星期一重開會議時，對臨時救濟議案除舉行最後投票外，並無其他行動。一般並預料衆院將於下週內接到外交委員會所草擬之對法·義·奧（中國亦可能在內）臨時救濟議案。援華之基金並不包括在參院五億九千七百萬美元之議案內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美共和黨參議員塔虎脫廿八日在參院對援外案激辮時稱：國務院對援外案所採取之態度，係根據於完全錯誤之觀點，如吾人通渦該案，則此項觀點將使美國完全崩潰。塔虎脫雖攻繫國務院之計劃，然又宣稱：渠願對五億九千七百萬美元之援助法，義·奧案投贊成粟。渠表示渠將爲减少數百億之馬歇爾長期計劃而奮鬥。塔虎脫稱：目前局勢係由羅斯福及杜魯門執政時代對蘇要求退讓而發生，並謂兩人應負蘇聯目前臻於强固地位，及必須支出數億美元供國外救濟之一切責任。又稱：德國自足及健全之工業經濟，對歐洲之繁榮極屬重要，德國工廠之拆除，足證波茨坦協定仍爲美國對德之基本政策。西歐國家內之社會主義阻止各國之復興，美元之大量分配亦非解決之道。參院通過兩項修正，第一項爲使美國官員對救濟品之分配，能自由收集情報；第二項，係禁止利用救濟金購買軍火。</p>

<h3>片山首相鄭重否認日本地下政府傳說　承認仍有封建勢力存在</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電〕本日之參院全體會議上，羽仁五郞就地下組織質問稱：傳在日本有地下組織之有在，內閣書記長西尾曾否認之，但現在確有妨害國民自由選舉之暴力團體存在，若不從速撲滅曾惹起戰爭之右翼勢力及暴力國體，則將不能獲得國際信用。</p>
<h3>挽救當前嚴重危機的緊急建議　上文接第二版</h3>
<p>第二，物資必須統制，配給必須普遍。政府應把這兩點工作作爲經濟施策的訊心，以增强政府合理支配並改善國民經濟生活的力量，而剗除當前紛亂矛盾的狀態。關於物資，政府應選擇民生日用品中最重要的，如糧食，紗布，食油，肥皂，捲烟等，先作大量嚴格的統制，並實施公正合理的配給，由公敎人員而推行至一般國民。物資有了合理的統制，則嚴禁一切囤積操縱的行爲，就易於收效，而物價亦可望其穩定。同時，若干日用物品，既有了合理配給，使大家能依照規定標準生活，則當者不能隨便享受，貧者亦不致有無法過活之苦。如是，即圃積物資，亦有何用？我們看英國在戰時實行此種制度，故能獲得對德戰爭的勝利，而戰後因美元恐慌，經濟危機嚴重，政府對物資的統制且較戰時更爲餒厲。現在英國各市塲上，即猪肉和鷄蛋等，亦均受嚴格的配給。日常所需，既受一定的限制後，雖責爲國王首相，亦無法破格享受。英國人此種經濟制度的完善，和其上下一致習於守法的精神，眞是値得我們反省和效法的。</p>
<p>在實施上兩項辦法時，或又慮及：　依照指數發薪，陡增國庫負担，將不免重蹈通貨與物價循環之故轍；　中國政治組織和社會風氣，都不及英國遠甚，貿然實施物資統制和配給，必弊多而利少。此項疑慮，不無理由。因而筆者進一步更主張：</p>
<p>第三、依據生活指數，對公敎人員待遇之調整，必須與簡政裁員及劃一各機關待遇同時進行。這不僅爲了增加經費的得資挹注和彌補，而且也正是提高政治效率之一法。不必諱言，目前中央地方各級機構，類多龐大臃腫，疊床架屋，應擇其業務性質重複衝突的分別裁併；對一班不需要的冗員，則予以遺散轉業。這樣，我相信省下來的經費，定不在小數，用之於改善待遇，相差必屬有限。否則，機關重疊，輾轉　預，從誤效率的增進，而虛耗國幣，養大批吃不飽衣不暖的官吏，「鷄肋　人」，反不如及早予以解放。至於各機關持遇，應由中央根據「同階同酬」，與「同工同酬』的原則，全面統籌，劃一規定，應使待遇祗按工作的性質和服務的成績，而不以機關之窮闊爲標準，各自定其高低。這樣庶幾可以打破勞逸不均待遇懸隔的不合理現象。</p>
<p>第四，物資的統制與配給，誠然是事繁責重，免不了弊　；但我們正要運用這一制度，以學習實騐的精神，以大刀闊斧的手段，並以破釜沉舟的決心，把我們的政治經濟制度打一進步的基礎。英國可以做得，我們爲甚麼做不得？中國的現代化，應迎頭趕上，亦就應從政治經濟的改造開始。政府與人民必須切實合作。大民要求生活有保障。政府應該負責；政府既眞要嚴懲貪汚，人民尤應切實檢舉·一個耕制度，祇要原則上無問題，按術上決不怕無辦法。尤其是物資的統制與配給，我們應看做整個國民經濟轉危爲安的大關鍵，祗許莫成功，不許其失敗。我們要藉此轉移社會的風氣·實行眞正的節約。在物資統制下，不容有一切巧取豪奪投機暴利的行爲；在實物配給制下，不容有任何達官貴人及富庶階層的特殊享受。這樣，纔能克一般社會心理上的不平，而轉移人民對政府的觀感；也纔能養成一種舉國上下勞逸平均，甘苦與共的良好空氣。政府與人民的合作，要在這種空氣由纔能建立，而國家任何危難也決無不可以克服之理。</p>
<p>建國之通，千緒萬端，針對常面的危機，呼籲挽救的努力，則政治經濟、對症下藥，宜莫如本文所提出的各聲。盰衡大局，軍事現在還無法結束，通貨膨脹與流通速度的加激，物價漲勢的愈來愈猛，似乎還是不可進免的趨勢。引領外援，令人短氣，何况美國貸款也還夾有其他的要求。面對國家空前的危難，「窮則變，變則通」，一稱淸明政治，安定經濟的大努力，是不容再緩的了！所望各方人士共起硏究，促其實現！（完）</p>
<p>吾人願知首相於和會之前，對此問題將如何決心臨之？片山首相對此答稱：現日本無秘密政府之存在，所謂暴力革命亦無可能。蓋戰爭結束以來，可能發生若斯非民主行爲之地盤，業已崩潰故也。惟封建之「老頭子」及「白相人」等組織，不能謂無，但政府自組閣以來，努力破壞此種封建組織，今後亦採取斷然之處置手段。</p>
<h3>日第一屆議會四度延長會期　與第二屆議會銜接</h3>

<h3>引水員罷工仍在僵持中　銅沙公會華藉引水表示拒與海關合作　金月石解釋要求未過高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕引水員罷工事件，昨日仍無解決之望，海關臨時僱甩之白俄引水昨已增至六人，航政局指派之華籍引水則並未前往報到。華籍引水經交通部發給執照者共有十八人，彼等自本年九月起有上海銅沙引水公會之組織，此此彼等拒絕合作，表示不願受海關之管理。銅沙引水公會理事長金月石昨會招待記者，渠認爲外籍引水員之要求增加引水　並無不合理之處，每月六千萬元之收入非但不足稱爲「貴族化」且係過低，因普通一小型外洋輪船船長之月入有一千美金，而引水之資格較船長爲高，且所負責任極為重大，以其工作價値而言，應得每月一千五百美金之報酬。此次外籍引水員要求增加，輪船公司均已表示願意，而海關所以堅決拒絕，金氏認爲有其政治原因，其關鍵則在於明年一月起引水員之管理　，將移交交通部航政局。</p>
<p>外洋船隻。不致斷絕</p>
<p>過去　藉水員，會向海關要求加入擔任引水工作，但爲海關蘇故推宕，故此次海關需要時，彼等亦不願受其驅使。彼等希望：（一）海關提出將管理權移交，（二）交通部撥款或代向銀行担保借款，以整理引水業務之工具。在此種僵持之局面下，昨日外洋輪出口者，有「蘇格德拉」與「漢姆蘭」兩艘，均由白俄引水領出，此外，若干輸船直接向華藉引水員接洽擔任引水工作，故嚼用尚不致　　。</p>

<h3>市府組織無變更　裁減人員不可能　市府呈政員闡明理由</h3>
<p>（本報訊）記者於昨日走訪市府人事處長鄭天收，詢以中央頒布收復區授權期限延長一年後，市府編制究竟是否即可暫維現狀，鄭處長答稱：「此乃最淺顯之常識」。蓋在授權期內，一切市政，吳市長即可全權處理之。鄭處長以目前仍有人未能明瞭，特舉例解釋稱：設若行政院議決市府縞制須照原額緊縮三分之一。則人事處耶將業經核定之三分之二市府人負報銓叙部送審，其餘三分之一人員，即成爲市府編制之額外者，中央即不予追認，然吳市長可視環境之需要，有權繼續任用。事實上本市業務繁車；市府當局曾一再表示，現有人員無法裁减，則市府之勢將維持現行編制，已毋庸爭辯。</p>
<p>記者爲求證實起見，特再趨訪吳市長，叩詢中央之延長收復區授權期限令，是否可適用於本市一市府之編制方面？吳市長答：「當然，當然」。</p>
<p>又記者頃自有關方面探悉；本市市府　制問題，業經行政院市府組織規程審查會分四次初審完畢，除員額方面稍有縮減外，組織並無變更，人事及新聞，並不改處為室，此次負責審查工作之行政院秘書唐鴻烈，昨特致函市府人事處長　天牧，謂詞典內政部業已同意。又關於人事機構之設置標準，　敘不也經商定：中央各院部會，　敘部業經商定：中央各院部會及省政府統轄市政府職員在五百人以上者，但設人事處。</p>
<p>關於人員方面酌量裁減一點市府業已呈行政院，闡明市府業務之繁重與現有人員之需要。原函　稱：市府蘇擬組織規程，計列職員三千五百七十六人，附屬擬稱一萬七千人，警察，工役，技工計二萬餘人不在其內，其職員之任免，調遷，考核，與警察，工役，技工之　　　　　端，均須呈府核定，基上標準，則人事處應設員額二百四十人，各局人事室約應設五十人以上，而此次所擬組織，於人事處僅設六十人，各局人事室甲種僅設三十六人，乙種僅設三十五人，丙種僅設十七人，揆之定例，相去懸殊，以之應付人事之管理，誠恐不敷，實未宜再事核減云云。</p>

<h3>移轉千電力恢復南市光光明</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本市閘北電力公司之巨型發電機，日前突然損壊，致南市即告停電。蓋南市電力係由華商電力公司供給，而華商電力公司則仰給於閘北，故閘北電力公司發電機損壊後，南市即受間接影響，頓入黑暗世界。公用局特於昨日下午召開臨時緊急會議，決定贊由上海電力公司及浦東電力公司設法節省電力一千瓦，售於無商轉供南市居民應用，俾暫時救急。據公用局趙局長於會後語記者：南市電燈，昨晚或恢復，如因線路關係而有阻礙時，則至遲於今晚可吿恢復。</p>

<h3>陰影籠罩下的　東北五十天</h3>
<p>國際性的陰影，　單著東北，國際上的人們注　着東北，但不幸的沒法打開由於這個陰影所形成的僵局。一</p>
<p>共匪在道個陰影裏，聯合着韓共，攏絡着武裝蒙胞，不斷的發動一次，二次，三次，四次，五次，六次的攻勢，把日人壓榨東北同胞建設起來的工礦和交通，弄得破碎，窒息，以至於不可收拾。</p>
<p>一次攻勢比一次兇，一次攻勢比一次破壊慘重，六次攻勢已使交通不能暢通，工礦界爲之變色，共匪犯人目的是：「奪取關外資源，資助關內擾亂！」</p>
<p>共匪的六次攻勢剛剛完，七次攻勢馬上又要來，現在，把六次攻勢，勾上一幅簡單的，據判斷將來七次攻勢，也許和六次的行動大同小異呢。</p>
<p>（本報潘陽廿二日航訊」東北國軍現在四個兵團的兵力，不够做理想上的分配，是大家共知而不可　言的一件事實，共匪對於這一點知道的更淸楚，所以每次攻勢都在這上面着眼。</p>
<p>六次攻勢</p>
<p>的前奏曲，是匪一冀，熱，遼軍區」李運昌的第八和第九兩個縱隊，在九月初，突然出現在遼西，開始破壊錦州到山海關的交通，並成　胡蘆島。</p>
<p>從九月六日起，到廿六日止，半個月的時間，不斷的戰鬥着，結果，共匪把錦西幾個工礦單位搞的陷於窒息，關內外補給綫中斷，葫蘆島受着大威脅，同時，國軍王鐵漢部還吃了一個虧。</p>
<p>九月廿八日，匪之六次攻勢，正式揭幕，匪在開原，鐵嶺間做大規模的進攻，企圖奪取潘陽北大門，瀋陽北六十公里的法庫，在九月卅日那天，首先陷落，匪更以第七縱隊主力，迅速圍攻西大門——新民，同時，南大門的遼陽，東大門的撫順，都在吿警</p>
<p>至此，共匪企圖大規模對潘陽的態勢已形成。偏巧蒲陽也</p>
<p>包圍攻擊</p>
<p>在演「空城計」，情　的確相當一嚴重，因爲那時機動部隊的廖耀湘兵團，正在營救錦州。許多人爲此捏了一把汗。</p>
<p>不過機動部隊，究竟是機動部隊，廖兵團星夜趕回，在新民巨流河間的高合山，黑夜中打了一個勝仗，保住了西門，捍衛了　陽。</p>
<p>據行轅軍事負責人說：道個仗雖然不算大，可是關係太大了，因爲新民附近一役改變了戰局，這也就是從九月廿八日到雙十節的第一期戰事。</p>
<p>第二期是從十月十一日開始，司廿一日上，共匪企圖拿着局　兵力威脅潘部，大規模襲擊東錢和遼西。匪後新民退後，改取鐵路樞紐新立屯，大鄭綫的大虎山，錦古綫的義縣，結果沒能全部成功，同時，東大門撫順外圍營盤，南雜木，鷄冠山之戰，國軍得利，匪第十及十一縱隊還有韓共李紅光支隊等，遭授敗北。</p>
<p>另外，國軍努力不呌侵踞營口港的匪軍沿路西擾溝帮子和大虎山，得到很大的成功。</p>
<p>北路擊破匪第一縱隊所派擾亂和破壊　嶺瀋陽間聯擊的經裝部隊，功在扭轉戰局，那就是鐵　南官糧密之役，在戰略上是小戰鬥贏得了大收穫。</p>
<p>十月十六日到十一月十八日，是攻勢第三期，這也是</p>
<p>最後一期</p>
<p>除了侯鏡如部隊為救北票，在義縣西北地區，因爲情報不靈，吃了一些虧外，此外，國軍都得了有利的戰果。</p>
<p>這一期，匪的計劃，是繼續破壊北寗路，但着重圍攻永吉和小豐滿水電廠。十六日開始圍攻，規模頗大，攻勢也猛。</p>
<p>曾澤生將軍，他率隊苦撐，梁華盛的保安團隊也很能配合國軍作戰，加以空軍的威力，結果，匪不得不撤退了，同時吉林軍民也得到了保衛吉林的榮譽。</p>
<p>在第三期，有一支生力軍，打了一個大勝仗，那就是傅作義的部隊，收復瀋陽西北南彰武，而在彰武以西三角地區，把匪第七縱隊，打了個落花流水，斃傷七千，俘獲八百，並得到了足以裝備一師的軍需品。</p>
<p>傳部的成功，在於</p>
<p>行軍機密</p>
<p>官兵受命後，攜帶大餅，不受飲食限制，不露聲色，銜枚急走，到達彰武，眞如神兵天降，一舉成功，博得人民喝彩。軍方負責人也在說：「這一仗，在第六次攻勢裏，是國軍最成功，共匪最失敗的戰鬥」。十一月中，整個凍北陷入了中，溫度降到了零下五度至寸度，匪的第六攻勢，於是也拉下了「終結」的幃幕。</p>
<p>東北行轅第ｕ處處長李樹正，在對記者陳述第六攻勢經過說：「戰事起於九月廿八日，止於十一月十八日，約計五十天，匪使用了十一個縱隊，並有韓匪，蒙匪，以及地方部隊，號稱卅萬衆，匪死傷十萬五，國軍傷亡兩萬八，結果是共匪攻勢失敗了」。</p>
<p>李處長最後的結論是：「陳總長判斷正確，指揮若定，始終按照確保工礦和戰略要地，依城作戰，以及捕提匪軍主力，集中優勢兵力，予匪各個擊破的既定計劃做去，結果匪遭受打擊，戰敗而退」！（特派員韓淸　）</p>

<h3>北大「工學院」（續完）</h3>
<p>— 彬彬</p>
<p>證以四十年歷史的淵源。　將在文化城得最後歸宿</p>
<p>二次隸屬北大</p>
<p>淪陷期中，偽府掛起了五色旗，對於學制亦大抄張作霖的成文，以北京大學統一各校。「北平大學工學院」遂為「偽北京大學之工學院」，這可算是第二次隸勝北大。</p>
<p>如是者又八年（二十七年至三十四年），日寇投降，神州光復，文化城之舊都，各校復員，先之以「臨時大學」，以各學院為各分班加以整理，「北平大學」不復存在，以北京大學為中心，統轄各學院，而此工學院之隸屬忽成問题。</p>
<p>北京大學原欲自創一個工學院，故不願接收，有人提議「北大」，「淸華」合辦，但「淸華」自有工學院，放亦拒絕，結果則屬於「北洋」，仍在端王府原址照常辦理，改名「北洋大學工學院」，是與「北洋」為第二次之聯系，但十八年為「並肩弟兄」，此次則北洋為尊長了。</p>
<p>最後　仍歸　北大</p>
<p>去夏平津兩處招生開學，增聘敎授，加强陣容，內地學生旣陸讀歸來，北方之舊生及投考之新生又踴躍而至。「羣山萬壑赴荆門」，頗極一時之盛。第一學期平穩度過，至今春忽傳不再招生，旋即發表分期遷併天津，後因工廠儀器難移，敎職學生安土重遷，亦多異議，故遷津之議，旋即取消，變而為改隸北大。又經過幾多之波折，最後小部令限八月一日接收，遂復為「北　大學之工學院」，是為第三次隸屬於北大，亦就是最後的歸宿。</p>
<p>以上四十四年之離合悲歡，層層說明，歷歷在目，欲知文化城之工業敎育典故者，欲求學於此城及北大學府之工院之靑年皆宜存覽，可省卻許多訪問參考也。</p>

<h3>中紡昨開董監事聯會　決加强收購國棉　陳部長擬向政府接洽供給頭寸</h3>
<p>（本社訊）中國紡建公司，於昨日上午十時起，舉行　監事聯席會議。討論項如下：　紡建靑島紗廠，煤斤恐慌，巳臻嚴煎附段，前日起已有部份停工，丞應法供應。議決由陳部長電燃管會迅撥煤斤五千噸，運往供應，又燃管會天津分處，目前尙有存煤，亦由陳部長電飭迅撥二千噸運往供應。上述煤斤，俟紡建公司及台灣省政府所訂每月供應煤斤五千噸之合同，於下月實施後，可局部撥還。再台灣省政府煤斤，如能按合同供給，則今後紡建公司所需煤斤，當毋虛匱乏。</p>
<p>收購國棉，截至目前爲止，尙不足五十萬噸，須加强收購，惟苦乏頭寸現鈔，擬由陳部長向政府接洽，供給頭寸，同時建議政府，爲充裕現鈔供應起見，請有關金融當局，老慮發行大鈔。</p>
<p>關於年賞問題，若照去年辦法，實不勝負担，因紡建公司木年遂照政府法令配售棉紗，配價甚有在成本之內，故盈餘有限，議決由陳部長向政府當局法變通辦理。繼爲報吿事項：　紡建公司听存紗布有限，目前所紡織者，大部份爲代紡棉紗，而軍用紗布供應歡量甚鉅，實難於應付。　此次石家莊損失棉花達二萬包，亦影饗公司原棉供應。　關於加配棉紗，政府意旨須在於抑平紗布市似，前日已收成效。今後決定視市場情形，以抑平市價爲原則，必要時隨時加配拋售。</p>
<h3>過程萎靡不振華股交易不多</h3>
<p>大戶在場外乘低有補，但少壯派已有出籠，雌有多大作爲。</p>
<p>晨開時，水紗低至即交三九五元，遞交四〇四元。開後即吿下落，二二三號等均出，一四三號等賣即交而退至三八三元及三九二元。一四八號等趁低有員，場外息價仍爲二角四及惡角八分半，曾回好至三八八元及三九八元左右。一四三號拋售即父，業外刺激見淡，三二號等再售　交，乃跌至即交三七九元，遞交三九〇元低價。惟場外有實力集團抵補，場內有一五七號等之維持，近午微升至三八五元及三九五元。少壯派前來了結，四五號等賣出，午收復退至三七九元及三九一元。結果較前收計即交股景福景綸五和各跌一成光景，永紗閘北華新信和美亞華豐新光中法勤興內衣國貨火柴中絲中紡各跌半成，新華中興平平，永公統益榮豐微挫。遞交股計華豐跌一成弱，餘股概降半成，場外各老股銀行股亦吿回跌，餘尙穩定。</p>
<h3>統債回小外股轉跌</h3>
<p>公債昨銀根影饗，亦告回小，統丙最開二五五〇〇元，自二五七〇○元退至二三六〇〇元而後轉盤。三六〇室進，五五〇室先進後出，結果較前收計統丙跌七百元，甲乙丁戊各降四百元，成交不過四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨以圈外刺激見减，止漲轉跌，廣帮有納，洋行帮銀行帮證券帮均售。怡紗晨開三六八〇〇〇元，退至三四八〇〇〇元，而後轉定。結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐業贗紙版怡啤鋼業各跌半成，藍格志跌一成，祥泰自來火平平，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>行局調整內匯率</h3>
<p>（本報訊）上海四行兩局一庫匯往各地匯款率，自明日起略有修正，茲錄其修正點如下：福建區：廈門侮千元六〇元（原八〇元），福州六〇元（原七〇元）</p>
<p>華股昨銀根見緊，業外黑市咸回，過程在平庸狀態中逐步萎靡，中途絕少振作，交易有限，泉州八〇元（原九〇元），其他各地八〇元（原九〇元）。贗東區：廣州六〇元（原一一〇元），汕頭六〇元（原一一〇元），海悶八〇元（原一二〇元）。江蘇區：徐州二〇元原二五元），連雲港三〇元（原二五元），泰縣一一○元（原一五元）。湖北區。漢口九〇元（原八〇元），武昌九〇元（原八〇元），江西區：南昌二五元（原三〇元），泰安三五元（原四○元）</p>

<p>（本報訊）中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布一三六六〇疋，合單疋一四三八〇疋，被單二九一〇條，申購單共三二一張。昨日現棉市况無甚做開，原因由於國家行局停止放款，到期棉花押款，亦須收回，更以月底並週六關係，互軋頭寸，賈戶銀根緊念，因此交易擱淺。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>春秋告別</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>最近本報重訂副刊計劃，本刋自下月起暫歸併於「自由談」，挪出篇幅，另出七種週刋。本刋從此雖然名隱實存，在形式上不得不與續者略申惜別之意。本刋創刋於民國二十一年十二月，到現在已整整十五年的歷史了。這期間當然獲得很多作家與讀者的支持和愛護，也耗費了歷屆編輯人不少的心血，却不料在本人接編十四個月的今天就將與讀者吿別。這固然是編者個人的遺憾；然　，回溯本刋創刋以來，內容性質便不斷的在改進革新，不可否認的改革就是進步，人類的祖先也許拖過尾巴，原始的馬蹄有五枚足趾，你却不能說失去尾巴於人類有什麽損失，而獨趾馬蹄確更能馳騁如意。本刋之併入「自由談」，在本報整個編輯方針上，又何嘗不是如此。</p>
<p>宿命諭者更會相信，人間沒有不散的筵席。本刋因定名「春秋」，所載又間有騷人墨客吟風弄月之葉，南唐後主早已問過「春風秋月何時了？」而春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏，目下將臨隆冬，不也正是本刋與牘者吿別最適當的時候嗎？况且十五年來耕耘的收獲，早巳散播在國內外讀者的心靈深處，這些種子的培育滋長，原是本刋牘者所顧祖當的實任，即如各地讀者由於本刋十五年的啓發與倡導，或則堅定了從事文藝的志趣，或則建立了文藝事業的基礎，甚至於一般刊物也多增關了類似本刋體裁的篇幅，這些正是本刋的期望。——那麼，期望漸次達成，又何在乎本刋形式上一時之有無呢？</p>
<p>雖則編者個人在這一年多的時問中，未能做到畫如讀者理想，常也不免延擱了作家的函稿，在今天也只有抱疚於心，而請求一聲原諒了。所謂「黯然消魂者惟別而已矣！」本爲人情之常，所以吿別之辭總不免帶幾分悽愴。可是根據上述兩點，本刋今日的暫向讀者辭別，也應該是愉快而樂觀的。</p>
<p>至於本刋積稿除一部分純文學稿件移轉文學週刋外，其餘附有回件信封貼足郵資開明地址者，當由編者陸讀退還。</p>
<p>本刋稿費通知單亦有少數地址不詳，無法投遞；倘有文稿業已發表，尙未接得是項通知者，務請早日函吿詳址，以便寄發。</p>
<p>有關本刋通訊請仍寄本報編輯部週刋編輯室。</p>
<h3>國樂與國樂器</h3>
<p>— 西廷</p>
<p>讀本刊「再建中國音樂」後，我有下面幾點意見：</p>
<p>首先，「樂器非音樂之別名」，這點必須切實認淸。有人以爲中國音樂必須由中國樂器演奏，其實樂器本身原爲表現音樂的工具，本不應有國籍之分。例如同樣是鋼琴與提琴，可以奏西班牙地方色彩的「小夜曲」，也可以奏富有濃烈民族性的俄羅斯民謠。如果謂中國的「國民音樂」有其性格上的特徵，那麼，我們儘可依此特徵作曲，而以進步完備的樂器把它表現出來。馬思聰的幾首小提琴「組曲」，依綏遠民歌情調而作，賀綠汀的鋼琴曲「牧童短笛」，也充滿了東方色彩。</p>
<p>也許有人說：不用中國樂器演奏，會將中國音樂的色彩减失一半。其實所减失的並非中國色彩而是原始色彩。因爲：道地國樂即指古代雅樂，其特點爲　單而原始。這簡陋原始之昔樂與任何一國的原始音樂都類似，進步到今日這樣程度的歐洲音樂，其在數百年前萌芽時期，也沒有和聲「對位」，樂器也極簡單幼稚。鋼琴的　光是一弦琴（Monochord），小提琴的老祖宗是類似我們琵　的Lery。如果他們一直迷　古　，他們今日不會有鋼琴與小提琴這樣完備的樂器。</p>
<p>至于改良樂器問題，早已喊得很　，而且也部份地實行了，但因我們的音樂停留不進的時間過久，即使能一下子遮上人家幾個世紀，而改良的結果也不過與進步樂器相類似。</p>
<p>爲什麽說西樂器進步而完備？因爲：它能够使用「和聲」而不受限制，變調完全自由（國樂中的琵琶則只有少數和聲）。它能够表現幽怨沈着的曲調。也能够奏出極其急速進行的旋律，顯示萬馬奔騰的豪情。它能够獨奏民歌，演室內樂，但也能够配成交嚮樂隊那麼龐大的組織。由于西樂器所用材料及構造的認眞而精密，其音域，音量，音色確非國樂樂器所可比擬。基于以上理由，今日我們所謂之西樂樂器，已成世界公用之樂器。</p>
<p>其次，應當一提的：我國先賢在樂理上的理解並不後人。明代朱載堉曾倡用「十二平均律」（以八音十二等分）「音階制度」，至今仍爲全世界所公用。這是西洋音樂家所欽佩的。因此，我覺得，如果能够在「和聲」，「對位法」，「曲體學」及「配器法」上面，利用西洋的原則，注意表現我們民族音樂的精神，則中國音樂的前途，將不再如今日之原始簡陋矣。</p>
<h3>自題南遊圖</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>民而十四秋，予南遊至馬來亞半島，其地多椰樹，高可參天；吉　坡一帶，海燕千萬成羣，時掠岸而過，　震天地。迄今十餘年，猶歷應憶其景色，因作南遊　，並題以詩。</p>
<p>萬里波濤海國秋，征帆十載記前遊：燕羣過岸聲如　，椰葉擎空翠欲流；棋布星羅王　賦，鼓催釭促鄭和舟，中年哀樂堪圓味，重擬圖南已白頭。</p>
<h3>方氏畫展觀後</h3>
<p>— 兌</p>
<p>經過正規的訓練，　蓄豐富的經驗，涵盡高尙的修養，在當代畫家像方君鑒氏的那樣成就，可以說是無慚作者的了。從她的近作者來，幅幅都表現純熟的技術，可是處處流露着中國文化特點的意味，不僅在題材方面，尤其意境神采，顯出靜穆超逸之妙，決不是亦步亦趨的西洋畫形式，也決不是僅從局部攙雜一點中國畫的質素而已。即從形式來說，比如其浴後一幅，所　托的半規紗窗映著森森翠竹；臨流一幅，湖石　楊，芙蓉出水，顯然使天人之美融合　間，以澹雅洗粗俗，以厚重留　佋，即使外行人看見，也應該覺得其不同流俗。其旅行所寫各幅，北地的雄渾，南州的秀傑，盡收入毫端，每一種警務，卻只在平凡的外形上提出其特點，使人耳目為之一新，美譽陳陳蹈製之病，最令人神往的是用中國紙　　的山水人物花果，純以剽勁的筆法，潑辣的　染，發揮生動之趣，這是中國文人盡的優點而竟能完全把握到，都可見畫的境界，是可以推陳出新，層出不窮的。</p>
<h3>副刊文藝說「春秋」</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>最早的報紙，是十分樸素的，不僅沒有副刋的名詞，速有文藝氣思的文字，也渺然不見踪跡。刋登這種軟性文字，是本報首創的。在本報創刋的發刋條例中，說：「如有騷人韻士，有願以短長什篇惠敎者，如天下各名區竹枝詞及長歌紀事之類，概不取值。」此就是徵文啟事。但那時徵稿不給稿酬，不作廣吿取費，已算是特別優待。</p>
<p>微文啓事刋出後，很有效果，許多文人，紛紛以詩詞小品見寄，大都是竹枝詞，遊仙詩，登高賦等，可稱為竹詞時代。在最近之五年（本報五十周年之紀念册）中，雷縉文中叙述當時的情形，說：「彼唱此和，喋喋不休，或描寫　情，或流連景物。互吟風雅，高據詞壇，無量數斗方名士，咸以姓名得綴報尾爲學。」報紙篇幅，致不能容，另發行「　　瑣記」收容之。這類文字，很能配合當時士大夫們的胃悶，對於報紙的營業也很有帮助。本報創列以後，雖即有副刋文字刋登，但沒有給他固定的地盤，也沒有副刋的形式，這可說是副刋的孕育時期。</p>
<p>副刋文字，旣受讀者們的歡迎，於是增加篇幅，據充範圍，那時的題材，小說，筆記等已代替了過去詩詞的地位，所以可稱做「說部時代」。一九一一年「自由談」創刋，更確定了副刋的形式，和社　首尾相對，成了報紙的定型。</p>
<p>早年的副刊字，多是游戲小品，雖有文藝的形式，而缺乏文藝的價值。民國五年，「自由談」一度吃呢崗位南社同人發表詩文的　地。</p>
<p>民國二十一年，「自由談」起了突變，轉向到新文藝的路上去，「自由談」那是隨時轉變了，但原來「自由談」的筆調，並沒有受到影響　，不過是轉移了他的陣地。本刋「春秋」就是在那時所開拓的新園地，有人分副刋爲南北兩派；南派尙請　，多談風月；北派重文學，喜談　事。如此，那時的「自油談」是應於北派，「春秋」則屬於南派。</p>
<p>復員以後，「春秋」和「自由談」，已易地而處了。「自由談」已名謂其實的恢復雜談的風格，「春秋」則成爲純文藝性的副刋。</p>
<p>文藝是沒有古今中外的界綫的，報紙的文字，也和雜誌不同，必須要股及大多數續者的愛好。文藝雖然是藝術的一部門，然而擴大起來，可以推贗到　術的整體。報紙上的文藝，應該是這種贗義的文藝，纔能符合許多讀者們的興趣。所以一般論者都相信：「北派副刊的發展，必趨於精神鑒賞，以文藝，音樂，書法。繒書。金石，考古·雕刻·美術等作品爲主」，這正是現在春秋的風格。</p>
<p>這種廣義的綜合性的文藝，從多方面的美感的材斜，陶冶人生的性靈，增加人生的興趣，創造人生的新活力，此純粹文藝更有力，因無纯文藝作品，好像是陽春白雪，不免有曲和寡之感的。</p>
<p>（本文原爲本報七十五週年紀念時應徵之稿，今特補刋，以存史料。）</p>
<h3>洞庭西山絕句</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>今夏六月二十七日，應方外友聞達上人之招，與煙橋小靑二兄有洞庭西山之行，薄遊三日，遍攬林屋洞消夏　石公山諸勝；遊踪所至，俗慮都　，信口成吟，聊誌鴻雪。</p>
<p>聚首襌堂別有悄，凉宵剪燭話平生；芭蕉葉上瀟瀟雨夢裏　聞碎玉聲。</p>
<p>跌宕茶邊復酒邊，淸言疊湧如泉；祇因貪聽芭蕉雨，誤我虛堂半夕眠。</p>
<p>下榻包山寺，與聞達上人及橋靑二兄夜話大雲堂上，兩夕皆雨，打芭蕉作碎玉聲，聽之忘倦。</p>
<p>奇石劈空鶯鬼斧，天開一綫歎神工；先登風弄鹽風伯，更上層崖叩碧穹。</p>
<p>步步艱難步步愁，還須鼓勇莫夷猶；老夫腰脚仍如昨，要到峨巖最上頭。</p>
<p>風弄爲石公山名勝之一，危崖中裂，高逾尋丈，而窄僅二尺許，祇可容一人躋攀而上；聞達山人鼓勇先登，予與小靑兄繼之，而烟橋兄見望而却步。</p>
<p>靜裏惟聞欵相乃聲，輕舟如在書中行；此心願似明明月，匪月坡前待月明。</p>
<p>石公山麓有平坡伸展入水，可容數百人坐，月夜嘯歌其上，必有佳致。</p>
<p>暘谷初陽乍吐光，虞淵斜日又昏黃；相煎相賊今何世，歌哭湖山下大荒。</p>
<p>河山洵美，而人謀不藏，　豆相煎，正不知伊於胡底？登臨之餘，涕泗　　矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「鶴見主任，御自働車已經準備下了。」</p>
<p>鶴見受到休息命令之後，剛剛預備借用電話，對自己的部下，接談兩句，身後忽地有人對鶴見這麼招呼着。一自働軍？還不如說是囚軍吧！」鶴見心下這麽想著，一轉身，只見一個下級勤務官打扮的靑年，手臂上套著值動臂章，舉手齊眉，行著軍禮。</p>
<p>「噢，上野公　離開這裏很遠嗎？」鶴見因是便服，並沒舉手，只點了點頭，這般故意問着。</p>
<p>「只隔着幾町路，不大遠。」値勤站得直挺挺地，十分恭謹；因鶴見的官職，比他高了好幾級，又是外任的紅官。</p>
<p>「很多幾日沒回東京了，我想欣賞一下上野公園和　沿路的夜景－假如沒有特殊命令，必須坐軍的話。」鶴見的態度，包含幾分氣憤，幾分執拗，還帶幾分　傲。口氣裏面，好像是說，縱有上司的命令，他仍舊情願步行。</p>
<p>「十二號有電話來，命令部下，必須用自働車送主任上新　大廈；因恐……靑年値勤，換了聲調。</p>
<p>「嗯？」鶴見有些驚詫了；因見這靑年勤務官，居然接受「〇十二」的命令，那當然是「自己人」了。</p>
<p>「情形是比前幾天格外緊張；各宗各派怕都要把互相爭鬥的情勢、集中在主任身上，以便轉移其對方的目光……！」勤務官這麽陳說著，態度十分誠懇但是他的話被鸛見的手勢止住了。</p>
<p>「哈……笑話！是絕對沒有的事。一個小小的電訊主任，算得了什麽。也値得　動他們那些大人物？」鶴見這兩句話，表示胸中藏着無限牢騷。</p>
<p>「主任！」這靑年勤務官把語調的緊張加濃了；「情形是這樣的：各黨各派的高級人物，因遠征大陸已經動員，支那的摧毀，毫無問題；時間很短，業不會有多大犧牲，更沒有大危險，所以都在國內，勾心鬥角地爭權奪利，十分忙碌。倒也不一定注意到主任身上。至多只是有些忌妒；因主任的宗派不同……」</p>
<p>「對呀，可見我沒有什麼危險，必須派人保護哪！」鶴見截斷了勤務官的話。</p>
<p>鸛見以一個秘密集團首腦的地位，又是一個高級長官的身份對下　說話，本來用不着如此嘮叨。可是鶴見的作風，有些與人不同；對於自己的體已部下，哪怕等級再小些，也十分注意；何况這個靑年，大半又是新進，當然要借著多說兩句話，　便把這靑年查驗一下。</p>

<h3>鬍鬚諧談</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>攬鏡自照，　見嘴巴上下已萌茁數　　鬚，難道我老起來了麽？</p>
<p>按：口上日髭，悶下日　。頰毛曰髯，　毛曰　。通稱鬍鬚。　，面毛也。</p>
<p>邊鬍鬚，項畔鬍鬚，倒是老結的現象。諺云：『嘴上無毛，做事不牢。」年輕人謀職，往往在自己覆歷表上寫大幾歲。否則；似難顯得經驗豐富辦事情穩賞而取信於人。</p>
<p>通常男子之美在於　眉。可視今日一般人卻憎惡　鬚。甚至塗拔毛藥使之脫落。或竟用小鑷子速根拔起。遠而視之，果宛若童山，光光如也；這而　之，則崢嶸突兀，孔穴櫐然。韓愈詩：「如摘鎖底髭。」李義山詩：「羞　鏡巾絲。」陳師道詩：「臥把靑鋼摘頷鬚。』　集詩：「田翁無箇事，對鏡　　鎮。」足見拔　十之風，自古已然，不過於今尤烈。然而畢竟是「野火燒不畫，春風次又生。」「階前芳草又　　」的。</p>
<p>鬍鬚是年齡的輸廓。司空圖詩：「黑鬍如寄白鬚生，一度秋秋慮阿？人老則近迂，多半不中詞之曰：「敎弟種　，以錐遍刺作孔，插以馬尾。』種鬚也有法兒，未免是樁笑話。</p>
<p>左傅：「至於靈王，生而有髭。」唐畫李光弼傅：「光弼母有　歡十，長五寸許，對韓國夫人。」這些，我認爲是「鈎鬍卵毛，」荒誕不經。荀子曰：『鈎有　，卵有毛，是說之難持者也</p>
<p>于思迺多鬚之貌，俗稱連腮鬍于。傳曰、「于思于思，棄甲復來。」從前我執敎某校，對學生們道：『于思于思，其狀若何？」共中一個矢口回答：「比上不足……」言至此，衆皆哄黨。我也捧腹。眞堪作于思之妙喻。</p>
<p>記得從前甲乙兩詩家相遇於途，甲係連鬍鬚十，乙係近視限。爲了要顯出彼此的才能，甲當着乙吟詩云：「君家兩眼太希奇，子在身邊問是誰？日漏紙總　鴨子，月移花影拾柴枝。因看畫壁摩傷鼻，爲鎖書廚夾住眉，更有一番堪笑處；吹燈燒却嘴層皮！」乙聽了，不甘示弱，見甲是個鬚子，就步原韵吟詩云：「君鬚何以這般奇？不像胡羊却像誰？雨過當胸拋玉露；風來滿面舞花枝。要分高下推尊髮，若論濃多豈　眉？拳到腮邊渾不怕，賴它遮定雨旁皮。」念得某甲「怒髮旣可働冠，牙鬚寧容不翹？」</p>
<p>鬍鬚以國族而諭，中國人較稀少。東洋短奴十之八九是阿　子。西洋男人無于思者，我未之見。據說墨索里尼每日至少刮一次鬍子。凡刀片經刮過者，槪不能用，其硬可知！</p>
<p>我幼時喜量觀父親拔鬍子。在書期裹，他老人家一壁看書一壁拔，差不多日以爲常。七七事愛以來，我時而發見父親的嘴閱頭部滿是于思。且色帶玄黃，似即將變白。某日，我冒險地問他何故不像往昔樣的從事「淸理」？他　着氣道：「衣食足而後知榮辱，際此年頭，鬍鬚云云，絮我不能周濟了。」這幾句話，在今日社會中，我相信有　多人會附議。</p>
<h3>話橘</h3>
<p>— 朱襄</p>
<p>秋未冬夜，橘子在果品中，佔盡風光！</p>
<p>橘之命義，據李時珍稱；「橘從　，凡雲五色爲慶，二色爲　，　雲外赤內黃，非烟非霧，郁郁紛紛之象，橘實外赤內黃，剖之杳霧紛郁，有似乎　雲，橘之從　，蓋取此意」。</p>
<p>遠在夏禹時代，橘已很著名了；書經禹　載稱；「揚州　包橋柚錫貢」。在那時，橘子已像花旗橘子的用東西包裹，書經有人說是漢儒僞造，但漢武帝時交趾已有橘官長一人，秩二百石，主貢御橘，橘在中國的得名，實在是很早的。</p>
<p>就江浙一帶講，淸代條州，太倉，嘉興，餘姚，上處，金華，素以產橘聞名的；但現在祇　黃岩，衢州二了，物產跟時代而變遷，中國紀戰歷史，雖稱精詳，但對經濟方面，却極疏忽，種橘宜斥鹵之地，距江海近，士性　腴，則結實甜茂，黃岩橘的得名，一是種　好，二是士性適宜，無論衢橘福橘，諭品質，都給黃岩橋打倒了。</p>
<p>橘有黃橘，塌橘，綿橘，油橘，凍橘等之分；塌橘大約即指今日之蜜橘，油橘皮似油飾，中堅而外黑，剖之不香，食之無味，爲橘類中最劣者，速橋於八月間始開白花，他橘已盡，凍橘却於冰雪中結子，至明年春二三月採食，顆粒雖小，而其味甚甜。一吃橘忌食螃蟹，橘蟹同食，十客易使人軟癱。</p>
<p>古人對柑橘，往往誤認，把綠橘誤爲柑于，梅堯臣就有這種笑話；他寫詩稱：「昔辨荆州誤，今爲越叟迷，黃柑與綠橘，正似珷玞圭」。世稱曾子固不能詩，他在咏橘詩中，却也有一首：</p>
<p>「剖見隋珠醉限開，丹砂綠手落塵埃，誰能有力如黃　，盡摘繁星始下來」。</p>
<p>以外交手腕論，戰國時，齊國晏子允推能手「晏十將使楚，楚王賜晏十酒，酒酣，二吏縛一人詣王，王日：縛者何爲者也？對曰：齊人也，坐盜。王視晏十而哂曰：齊人固善盜乎！晏十避席對曰：嬰聞之，橘生淮南則爲橋，逾淮則爲枳，今此人生長於齊，不爲盜，入楚則盜，得無楚水土使人善盜耶！楚王慚服」！並蒂運在現在，尙屬可見，並著橋卻已經無了。但在梁代宋代中，一締結三十子，十二子者，時見紀戰，在帝制時代中，這是國家的祥瑞，現在楠物學發達，如果此種事件，可獲嘉獎，植物學家用心種植起來，是不甚難的。</p>
<h3>自然界的音樂</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>客歲初夏，曾在楊樹浦一所敎會大學裏　桓一時，　　那時該處雖多斷　殘壁，　　滿目，但畢竟是所高等學府，朝夕相見的又盡是些「牘聖賢書」的人，所以與市　生活顯有雅俗之別。</p>
<p>我所居住的是單身男敎員宿舍，四週權有花木扶疏，小有園林之勝，惟同居者旣皆單身，淸凉孤寂，顧情思景，不難了然。宿舍旁邊的草地上，有一個周圍丈餘的凹陷盆地，天雨後積水盈尺，宛然成池，池內有靑蛙無數，牠們入水而游，出水而跳，　然把水池當做樂園，每値華燈初上，情形更爲熱鬧，整千的靑蛙，由一只聲音較大的老蛙領導，齊聲共鳴，喧　嘹嘹，澈夜不絕，唱得興高彩烈時還跑跑跳跳，恰如載歌載舞，可想其樂悠悠。如此不但使宿舍裏的單身客打破了寂寞，並且起初嫌其　聲太鬧，使人好夢雜圓成爲人睡時的一大威脅，後來漸漸地聽慣，倒把它作爲天然的　　會，有時更以此　當摧眠曲。</p>
<p>那時我連想起山林虎嘯，花　島語，概乎世間生靈，未有不會歌唱者，豈僅蛙嗚而已。希臘學者Anaximander對此有更進一層的見地，他說；「宇宙間的音聲莫不合乎韻律，水浪的激響，疾風的吹流，血液的循環，　　德走動，由此所生的聲音，雖微不可辨但都有　律的存在，甚至兩性　愛時熱情沸騰，血液的衝動　於　常，所生　律亦有別致。」基於上</p>
<p>我會細細地聽辨：水中蛙鳴，枝頭　　，在間鳥　，歇浦　聲，　各有其規律的音調，那是我在校園中對於各種悅耳的交　，無以名之，名之日自然界的音樂，到現在還使我留　着這個愉快的迴憶。</p>
<h3>鐙下雜記</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>朝捧夕罵</p>
<p>批評往往是很難得公正的，不是捧，就是駡，淸人元名子撰「儒林瑣記」記袁十才云：「子才爲詩文，才氣續逸，語必標新，尤　獎掖後進。片章斷句，稱譽不休，一時文士多宗之，公卿戟　，以得見爲幸。高麗琉球爭購其詩。然身後聲名頓减，學者以爲詬病，然亦不能廢也。有門生某，當刻私印云：「隨園門下士」，袁死後，毀者日起，因復刻云：「悔作隨國門下士」。張問陶（船山）初名其詩日：「推袁集」，後乃更今名。同一個人，前後　譽之不同如此。速磐磐大方如船山，也還不能免俗，其他更可想而知了。</p>
<p>今之文壇，也還是重大不重作品，所以批評的對象，往往要牽涉到人以及其籍貫，年齡，乃至生理上的缺點之類，而作品倒尙在其式，或甚至放到腦後去了。爲了種種原因，朝捧而夕駡的現象，也常有。可見古今文人原是一例的！</p>
<h3>書法弊十三年</h3>
<p>— 丁榮觀</p>
<p>十三年前！即二十四年十一月三日，書時代的我國政府金融改革令公佈，從此各省形式不一各自爲政的硬幣紙幣趨於一律。此舉開我國貨幣史上空前劃一的輝惶記錄，由於信用的卓者，八年的抗戰：政令的統一，經濟的穩定，軍縉的供應，均得推行無阻。有人說：要沒有十三年前的幣制改革，則改革一年半後突然面臨的抗戰長期決策也無由進行；而抗戰的勝利，也不啻是法幣對日圓對偽儲備券浴血肉搏的奏捷，法　的功績　大，吾人將勝利的戰果歸功於戰前幣制改革的成功，也不爲過。法幣對民族對國家的貢獻，至比也可謂仁至義盡了！</p>
<p>所惜抗戰獲勝之後，法幣並沒有隨勝利而吿退，二年來復員的供需，戡亂的持續，乃至官僚資本通貨膨脹等等的推波助瀾；法幣的聲價，偵如江河日下一發而不可扼止，昔日舉國歌頌衆口同譽的功臣，現已成十目所視十惡不赦的罪人！物價的指數飛騰不已，法幣的貶值也直下無底，起初是算學級數，繼之是幾何級數，最後是天文數字！戰前法幣穩定在美金三十元合法幣一百元的比値上，現在美匯基準隨時調整，日前已至七萬三千元的驚人距難。來日大難，方興未艾：戰前號稱五十元一百元的大票，現在一萬元及喧傳中的五萬元也不覺其大。法幣的變遷如此，偵令人有不勝今昔之慨了！</p>
<p>雖然，法幣是無罪的！這不是牠的過錯，一切是人爲的原因。法幣在目前仍解救了政府在收支不平衡上的困難，而牠的惡性膨脹，也尙未到首次戰後的、「馬克一興此次戰後的「戈比」的地步。縱然其後果是不難想像，現在，前師可鑒，覆轍難蹈；懸崖勒馬，挽狂瀾於將倒。面臨着道法幣創行十三周的今日，我人　今思昔，懲前毖後，提出「救救法幣一「搶救法幣」的呼籲來，也不是沒有意味事吧？</p>
<h3>波士頓街道</h3>
<p>— 張啓</p>
<p>波士頓位於美國東北角，瀕大西洋岸，商業緊盛，好像上海那樣的的一個重要港口。該城有因為波士頓城是由許多市鎮合併而成，各市縣都各有其中心，各街道依著不同的方向，像蜘蛛網那樣的四散開去，路名都是用過去知名人士題取的，不像紐約那樣有第一街第二街那樣的容易辨認。當我在路上詢問方向時，有位老先生吿訴我，波城有個傅說，調所有市街的舖設，是跟隨耕牛踐踏的方向而定的，所以很不容易找，有時走了一些路，而傳說，也真會無形中相信起來了，在波士頓市有華盛頓街，在　林市，牛頭市及蘇茂威市等都有。在同一市中，更有哈佛街(Street),哈佛道（Aveune),哈佛地（place）等複雜的路名。這對於初到這裏的外地大，確是一件頭痛的事。市內有公共汽車，地上電車，地下電車，付一角錢的銀幣，無諭那節車都可以趁上，而中途得換乘他事，直至目的地，不另付費，所以交通尙稱便利，只是街道彎曲複雜，不易辨認。</p>
<h3>繁霜</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>白露一過，霜雪更又到了。劉熙擇天　言：「霜者喪也對植物，確有這種威力，只有楊萬里對霜曉一詩，却說得非常風韻，他說：「荒荒搜日作秋暉，稍稍微喧破曉霏，只有江楓偏得意，夜挼霜水染紅衣。」詩人大都悲秋，楊萬里這首詩，却是例外。</p>
<p>世稱高山上無霜露，此話我在浙西天目山上曾考騐非虛，天目山拔海一。五四七尺，晨起穿林薄中，並無霜露，這原因大概是拔海過高，氣淸風緊，雖微有霧氣，却被山風吹散，所以沒有霜露，不過高山逢雪，却是首先遭殃的。</p>
<p>六月雪是寃獄戲名，但六月霜也是一樣；淮南子稱：「鄒析事梁惠王盡忠，左右讚之，王擊之獄，衍仰天而哭，夏五月天為之下霜。」在古代書緒中，天人相應如此，現在寃獄不能說無，哭起來不知靈不靈了。</p>
<p>詠香艷詩，如嫩眞子金陵詩曰：「歳晚　官聊自保，日高青女尙續陳。」蒼官說松，靑女說霜，這種設想，可稱奇絕。</p>
<p>將下露時，水鄉中的鷓鴣烏先羣飛長嗚，動物畏寒如此，像鷓鴣樣的人類，恐怕也不在少噸！</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>處處聞啼烏</p>
<p>「處處聞啼烏」的女主角材楚卿因受商人宋　雨誘騙而竹了如的嫉太太，當她受不件宋妻的欺凌時，她便斷然離去，再嫁了那位「婦女問題」專家張渭卿，結果因不得張之諒解而服毒自殺。綜觀全劇、作者企圖表現一個不幸走錯了路的弱女子的遭遇，這樣的故事，現實社會裏確實很多，但作者只搬演了故事，沒有體格的給予批判，指出這問題的　結所在，甚至把宋時雨描寫得那樣善良，似乎一切的罪名都應該由宋妻來担負，可是他忘了宋妻亦是一個可憐的被騙者，她與林楚卿不過是五十步與百步之分，而真正的罪魁宋時雨，却被輕輕放過了，甚至相反獲得了同情。再說那佩「婦女問題」專家張渭卿，那更是個賣狗皮靑藥的傢伙，逼使杜楚卿白殺的，他亦是凶千之一。由於上面這些問題沒有獲得正確解答，這個劇本的生題也就，模糊了。</p>
<p>演出上歐陽莎菲，徐立，張琬，都頗稱職，　嚴　浮滑而過火。屠光啓的導演成續，像記流水賬——他是最懂得怎樣迎合小市民觀衆的口胃</p>
<p>原子彈秘密</p>
<p>這張描寫原十彈從研究。製造·試驗以至投向日本廣島爲止的科學紀錄影片，它同時亦帶來了二次大戰的勝利。可是在今天看起來，這影片多少帶着一點示威性，高度的科學成就必須爲人類幸福服務，否則換來的必然是破壊興毀減。</p>
<p>此片導演處理嚴　，演員們的演技均在水準之上。全片極爲平穩。</p>
<p>卿本佳人</p>
<p>琪恩泰妮與亭利方逹主演的喜劇片，描寫一個女騙子的故事。劇中情節不合現處頗多，劇本亦爲下乘之作，演出雖輕鬆，俱非上乘喜劇格調，做是迎合　衆的誇張手法而已。</p>
<p>演員以琪恩泰妮較佳於寧利方逹。又是一張喜劇片，以描寫乞變成貴族婦人串通了這個戲，但最後把女主角吉蒂投入浪蕩爵士的懷抱上看來，作者是一切出</p>
<p>演以處理老公爵得子的　　跌死一場為佳。　　高黛的吉蒂頗不錯，雷密倫成績欠佳。</p>
<p>海蜂英烈傳</p>
<p>共和公司出品的戰爭片，以敘述此次大戰中美國海軍陸戰隊中工程隊在抗日戰爭中的偉續。全片雖有衆多的緊張場面，但由於導演處理的較差，顯得散漫而鬆懈。</p>
<p>演員中蘇　海華的女記者，演技平庸，約翰　恩亦僅稱職，倒是但尼斯奧卡斐的演出，較爲差强人意。</p>

The Chairman agreed to the requests, and regarding relief, he also said that the local authorities should also think of ways to solve the problems. (News about the meeting of the Provisional Assembly is published on page 2, column 7)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 29th] According to reports, there was a fierce battle south of Baoding last night. Two regiments of bandits attacked the Dongshiqiao defense area held by the National Army. The National Army stood firm and repelled the attack. By 4:00 AM, reinforcements from Baoding arrived, and the bandits retreated, leaving behind their dead.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 29th] The fighting in the suburbs of Yuanshi City is still fierce. On the night of the 27th, the bandits dug trenches and built fortifications 50 meters from the city, indicating a long-term intention. On the afternoon of the 28th, they were bombarded by the National Army, suffering heavy casualties and the fortifications were completely destroyed. The bandits south of the city have retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] The local forces in northern Anhui recovered Taihe County on the 27th, dividing Chen Yi's four columns into two. The 1st Column entrenched itself at Yuanqiangji, northeast of Taihe, while the 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns fled to the area of Jieshou and Shenqiu.

They were routed towards the border of Fuyang and are now being mopped up. The magistrate and commissioner of Fuyang County have returned to the city to resume office, intensifying efforts to comfort the refugees and handle the aftermath. A war-torn area supervision group has also been established. Powerful units of the National Army are attacking Sixian County from Guzhen. The bandit troops of Zhao Huichuan in the city split into groups and fled towards Chengouji, Dazhuang, and Qingyang. The bandit troops of Fu Maoru in Sixian City abandoned the city on the 29th, and Sixian was thus recovered.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuizhou, 29th] The bandits' 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns, which besieged Jinxiang, have reportedly retreated to Jiuxian, Shanxian, and Chengwujian to reorganize after suffering heavy losses. It is estimated that one division is stationed at Weiwan, west of Juye County, and two divisions are stationed at Puji, east of Caoxian County, forming one column. Two columns are stationed at the Tianhou Temple south of Chengwu, and an independent brigade is stationed at Liangshan. Currently, Wanti, Heze, Jinxiang, Jining, and Yutai are all firmly defended by the National Army. Only Jiuxian, Shanxian, Chengwu, Juye, Jiaxiang, and Juancheng are still in the hands of the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] Traffic on the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou section has been partially restored. Trains run between Zhengzhou and Shangqiu, as well as between Xuzhou and Huangkou. Buses run between Huangkou and Shangqiu.</p>
<h3>Order Gradually Restored in Eastern Hubei and Western Anhui: No Bandit Traces in Susong and Qianshan Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The official announcement states that the bandits of Liu Bocheng's troops, who disturbed eastern Hubei, have been severely suppressed by the National Army and fled to the northwest, attempting to join forces with Li Xiannian's bandit troops. As of the 29th, there were no bandit traces in Susong, Guangji, Huangmei, Macheng, Xishui, Huanggang, and Xinshui counties, and their nearby towns. Local order has been restored to tranquility under the maintenance of local people and security police. In addition, the bandits in the Qianshan area of western Anhui have also fled, and order is gradually being restored.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] Military news: (A) Some remnants of the 1st Column of bandits, besieged by the National Army in the Xuanhuaidian area, broke through and arrived at Sujiahe (northeast of Xuanhuaidian) on the morning of the 28th. Some fled to the vicinity of Dingyuandian, and are still fighting with the National Army. Furthermore, the bandit independent brigade attacked Macheng on the 28th but failed.

<h3>Jiangnan Divided into Garrison Districts; Wang Maogong Promulgates Eight Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] After Jiangnan was divided into garrison districts, Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, solemnly promulgated eight points to public servants and the people of the entire province: Township and village security personnel who collude with bandits, steal from bandits, or harbor bandits will be investigated and punished severely, as if they were bandits themselves. If anyone knows about bandits and does not report them, their joint security neighbors will be punished as if they were harboring bandits. Township and village heads who fail to detect bandits in advance will also be severely punished. In communist bandit cases, no bail will be allowed before the conclusion of the trial, and those who act as guarantors for bandits will be punished. All able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 45 will be organized into civil defense teams, register civilian guns, and use them for self-defense. The first-class civil defense teams will be responsible for patrolling and checking the important passages in the county, urban and rural areas. Those who are negligent in their responsibilities will be punished according to military law. Close joint defense will be established between counties and between villages, with regular sentry duties and joint suppression efforts. Those who are cowardly in the face of battle, or those who fail to cooperate with neighboring villages, will be punished according to military law. Commissioners, county magistrates, and police officers will be jointly responsible for the failure to eliminate bandits in their jurisdictions within the prescribed time limit. From now on, all bandit cases in the counties will be tried by military law.</p>
<h3>Situation in Yichuan City Unclear</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 29th] More than 4,000 communist bandits from the Mangxue and Shangcai areas of Yichuan County crossed the Yi River and gathered in the Huaying, Zhongying, and Mingbi areas.

The Anbian defending troops engaged in a fierce battle with the invading bandits on the 27th, and the situation is currently unclear. Our reinforcements are expected to arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Elite Troops of the National Army in Changchun Continuously Capture Outlying Strongholds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] Military News: Since the National Army eliminated the main force of the bandit troops in western Liaoning, and the Beining Railway has been reopened, the remnants of the 7th and 8th Columns of bandit troops in western Liaoning and the 2nd Independent Division of the Eastern Mongolia Military Region are now hiding in the area west of Beipiao, attempting to reorganize. In the past week, powerful units of the National Army in Changchun have continuously captured outlying strongholds such as Xinlitun, Fangniugou, Kalun, Mishazi, Fanjiatun, and Taojiatun. The bandit troops along the Jichang Railway have now fled to the southern section of Jilin Province, and traffic on the Jichang Highway is expected to be restored soon. Furthermore, the stubborn bandits east of the Shenyang-Siping section have now been routed to the area east of Xi'an. It is generally expected that merchants and travelers between Changchun and Shenyang will be able to safely travel back and forth on the highway near the railway in the near future.</p>

<h3>Supplementary National Assembly Delegate from Fenghua Not Eligible for Re-election; Decided by the Electoral Commission Yesterday After Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] After Chairman Chiang was nominated as a candidate for National Assembly delegate by people from his hometown, he expressed his intention to withdraw from the election. However, the result of the National Assembly delegate vote in Fenghua showed that the people unanimously supported him as a representative with great enthusiasm, and Wang Zhengting, the candidate originally decided by the party in that county, did not receive a single vote, so he could not be supplemented as a candidate. The Fenghua County Election Office reported this to the Election Commission for instructions on how to resolve the matter. The Election Commission held its 16th meeting on the 29th and discussed the matter. The Fenghua County Election Office reported that Chairman Chiang received 107,271 votes, and a supplementary representative could not be elected. It was proposed that a re-election be held from the 11th to the 13th of next month. Based on this report, the Election Commission believes that since a supplementary representative could not be elected, the election cannot continue to be held. If the Chairman firmly declines, another election can be held. The resolution of the Election Commission is that "supplementary elections are not permitted by law."</p>
<h3>Invading Mongolian Troops Have Withdrawn North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 29th] The Mongolian troops who crossed the border into Suiyuan Province began to withdraw north in mid-December. There are no more Mongolian tents north of Baiqun Temple, and the border area is more tranquil than before.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu High Court Accepts Its First Election Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Jiang Guangzhao Sues Zhang Renji, Et Al.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] Disputes have arisen repeatedly in various counties of Jiangsu Province regarding the regional elections for National Assembly delegates. The Jiangsu High Court accepted its first election lawsuit on the 29th. The plaintiff, Jiang Guangzhao, is a lawyer nominated by the Chinese Youth Party as a regional candidate in Jingjiang County. He is suing Chen Jicheng, the Beiping Garrison Commander, and Liu Zhixun, Zhang Renji, and the other three regional candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, for illegal election activities, requesting the court to invalidate the election votes received by the three defendants, and requesting the court to transfer the documents to the Jiangsu Provincial Election Office so that he can be temporarily issued a certificate of election. According to his complaint, the defendant Chen Jicheng, as a government and military official, had submitted an application to relinquish his candidate status, which had been reported by the military. Furthermore, the two defendants, Liu and Zhang, were only announced temporarily on the day of the election, and were not formally and legally produced. Jingjiang is located in northern Jiangsu, and except for the urban area, the whole county has been harassed by communist troops. The heads of the districts and towns are all working in the city. In this general election, except for the urban area where voters actually voted, the district heads and 34 town heads in various rural areas closed the doors and fabricated votes under the direction of Zhang Zhuan, the director of the election office, and Huang, the director of the first district, and Chen Yun, the director of the second district. This is truly fraudulent and illegal.</p>
<h3>Soviet Suggestions Regarding the Peace Conference with Japan; Our Authorities are Currently Considering Them; The Philippines Will Request That It Be Held in Baguio</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed on the 29th that the Soviet Union's reply to our country's preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan had been delivered to the Foreign Ministry by Chargé d'Affaires Federin. The suggestion to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers in China is currently being considered by our authorities. As for the replies from Britain and the United States to our suggestions, they have not yet been received. According to reliable information, our position on the preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan is extremely firm. According to the suggestion made on the 17th of this month, the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should meet to discuss the issue, and adopt a majority voting system including the approval of the four powers. On the one hand, it can take into account the opinions of countries other than the four powers, and on the other hand, it can reserve the veto power of the four powers, so as to maintain the major interests of the major countries. This is the fairest way to deal with the legal issues. The Soviet suggestions did not completely reject our suggestions, but were a very friendly consultation. There is still hope for coordination between the four powers on this issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 29th, United Press] The Manila Chronicle said that reliable sources say that the Philippines is now requesting that the future peace conference with Japan be held in Baguio.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, 29th] The Sydney Morning Herald said in an editorial today that Molotov's suggestion to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in January of next year to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan may not receive much support. This is because the other countries in the Foreign Ministers' Conference have accepted the principle that the peace treaty should be drawn up by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, not by the five great powers.</p>
<h3>Drafting the Presidential Office Organization Law; The Civil Affairs Office of the National Government is Handling This Carefully; Three Parties Continue to Confer on the Nomination of Legislative Council Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly is about to open, and constitutional government is imminent. The Civil Affairs Office of the National Government is currently working on drafting the Presidential Office Organization Law. However, because our country has no precedent, there is a lack of blueprints for reference during the drafting process, so those responsible for handling this matter are extremely cautious.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] After the State Council passed the postponement of the Legislative Council election by one month, the impact of this is that it does not comply with the Constitution, because the Constitution stipulates that the Legislative Council must be established within one month after the National Assembly closes. Now the Legislative Council election will have to be held until January 10th, so it will inevitably violate the Constitution. Some people are paying close attention to this. Authoritative sources believe that postponing the National Assembly is also a violation of the Constitution, so it is possible to hold the opening ceremony as scheduled and then hold the congress. At the same time, the results of the current election are still unknown. If less than half of the representatives are elected, then the meeting cannot be held, and it cannot be said to be a violation of the Constitution. Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party said that everything depends on the situation at that time. According to an observer, if the National Assembly is held as scheduled, but the Legislative Council has not been established, then the Premier of the Executive Yuan, even if appointed by the President, cannot be reorganized and established without the consent of the Legislative Council. Therefore, a "caretaker government" may appear to maintain this transition period, but this system can only be implemented under unavoidable circumstances. It is not yet certain whether China must be forced to such a situation and not have a caretaker government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] On the afternoon of the 29th, Kuomintang members continued to invite members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party to discuss the list of candidates nominated by political parties for the Legislative Council. The main purpose was still to coordinate the selection of candidates and regions, but it is reported that no results were obtained. At the same time, the participants also discussed the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party participating in local public opinion institutions. After discussion, a solution was reached. It is also learned that Yang Junming of the Democratic Socialist Party visited Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, on the morning of the 29th, requesting that the list of senators previously submitted by Lei Zhen be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion as soon as possible, and then submitted to the State Council for filing, so that the election of senators could be handled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The work of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Election Guidance Committee in reviewing the lists of Legislative Council candidates of the three parties in groups has come to an end again. Only the third group met on the 29th. It is reported that in the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party, it was discovered that they had nominated candidates jointly in some regions. Although meetings were held for several days to try to arrange this, more than 30 people could not be allocated due to the factual organization. The nine-member small group meeting of the three parties was held at the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss ways to seek a solution.</p>
<h3>Electoral Commission Decides on Method for Preserving Ballots</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the question of how to preserve the National Assembly election ballots after the results have been counted, the General Election Affairs Office has decided on the following method: "For all voting books and vote-counting minutes related to the National Assembly delegate elections, a copy must be made for the purpose of allowing voters or candidates to request to read them. The originals must be preserved for six years. As for the preservation of election ballots, except for those that need to be destroyed after a ruling on an election lawsuit, all other election ballots must be preserved by the competent election authorities for six months after the National Assembly convenes before they can be destroyed."</p>
<h3>The Electoral Commission Seriously Issues National Assembly Delegate Election Certificates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly delegate election certificates will only be issued after the election results from all over the country have been reported to the Electoral Commission, and the Electoral Commission has verified that there are no errors. The Electoral Commission is extremely cautious about this procedure, so it will soon issue a circular to all election offices throughout the country to comply with.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Regulations for the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Council Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Legislative Council today passed an amendment to Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Council Members, adding an item after the original text, so that people from various occupational groups who participated in the Constituent Assembly last year can participate in this year's general election. These workers include teachers, technicians, and specialized workers. The amended articles of Article 6 of the two regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Draft Amendment to Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates: Article 6 Occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election are limited to those who have been legally registered with their competent authorities.

<h3>The Legislative Council Urges the Executive Yuan to Formulate the Special Construction Donation Regulations as Quickly as Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Legislative Council member Zuo Gong and 26 others submitted a temporary motion at today's Legislative Council meeting, suggesting that the Executive Yuan be urged to formulate the Special Construction Donation Regulations as soon as possible and submit them to the Legislative Council for review. The motion pointed out that the decision to collect the Special Construction Donation has been made for a long time. The Legislative Council, the Senate, and other relevant institutions have held symposiums to provide opinions, and the National Economic Commission has also discussed it repeatedly. The regulations should be drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Council for completion of the legislative process and implementation. However, a long time has passed, and the regulations have not yet been drafted and submitted to the Legislative Council. Proposer Zuo Gong stood up during the discussion and explained two points: Although the government's revenue has increased, its expenditures have also increased, and the revenue and expenditure situation is still very insufficient. Since the Special Construction Donation has been decided to be collected, it should be urged to be handled quickly. According to incomplete news, France, which is included in the American aid to Europe plan, also has a very severe economic situation. France has drafted a method to use the deposits of its citizens in the United States, which is worthy of attention. After Zuo's explanation, most of the Legislative Council members applauded, and the motion was passed. The council decided to ask the Executive Yuan to draft the regulations as soon as possible and submit them to the council for review.</p>

<h3>Amendment to the Regulations for Penalizing Transactions of Gold and Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 29th] The Legislative Yuan passed this morning the amended Regulations for Penalizing Transactions of Gold and Foreign Currency. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the original regulations stipulating that anyone carrying foreign currency into the country should exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its designated exchange within the day of entry, and those who conceal it without reporting would have it confiscated, recognized that this was tantamount to a prohibition on all foreign currency imports regardless of the amount, causing considerable difficulties in implementation, especially for returning overseas Chinese. Therefore, it was requested that the regulations be amended to allow both Chinese and foreign nationals entering the country to carry up to US$100 or its equivalent in other foreign currencies. Those exceeding this limit should automatically register with customs and exchange the excess for national currency at the local Central Bank or its designated exchange on the day of entry. The proposal was submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan and reviewed by the Criminal Law, Finance, and Economic Committees. They generally agreed that some overseas Chinese returning to the country for business purposes, carrying foreign currency or gold, would be unable to exchange it back when leaving the country if forced to convert it into legal tender. Therefore, it was decided that those entering or transiting the country would be allowed to carry up to ten taels of gold and US$100 in foreign currency per person. For amounts exceeding these limits, those entering the country should exchange them for national currency at the market price with the Central Bank, while those transiting the country could deposit them with customs for safekeeping for a fixed period (originally proposed as two months) and reclaim them upon departure. If unclaimed after the deadline, they would be exchanged for national currency by the Central Bank. During the Legislative Yuan's discussion today, various legislators expressed opinions, with some considering the two-month deadline too short and others finding the regulations too strict. Chen Ruxuan also argued that the imbalance between the black market and official exchange rates would render these restrictions ineffective. Ultimately, the amended regulations as reviewed by the three committees were adopted with slight modifications. The deadline for transit passengers to reclaim foreign currency and gold deposited with customs before departure was extended from two to six months, which was unanimously approved. (The full text of the regulations is printed on the left corner of page two.)</p>

<h3>Implementation Measures for Supplementary Regulations on the Election of National Assembly Representatives and Legislators</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Yesterday, the State Council discussed and approved the implementation measures for the supplementary regulations on the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, as drafted by the Election Headquarters. The details of the measures are as follows:</p>
<p>The supplementary regulations on the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators were promulgated by the National Government on November 13th and have been in effect since the date of promulgation. All provinces and cities, whether unable to conduct elections entirely or partially, or able to conduct elections according to the original procedures, and provinces, cities, counties, and equivalent administrative units that had elections disrupted by bandits and are resuming them, should follow the provisions of these regulations to ensure uniformity. The following implementation measures are hereby formulated by this headquarters.</p>
<p>Article 1 of the supplementary regulations refers to provinces, regions, counties, cities, and equivalent administrative areas or organizations that are entirely unable to conduct elections. If, on the date of arrival of these measures, elections remain entirely or partially unfeasible, the election offices in the respective provinces, regions, counties, and cities should conduct elections in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the regulations, in neighboring areas or designated locations. The locations should be determined as follows: A. If elections are entirely or partially unfeasible in the entire province or within various regions of the province, they should be temporarily conducted at the location of the provincial or regional election office. B. If elections are entirely or partially unfeasible in counties, cities, and equivalent administrative units, they should be conducted at the location of the county or city election office.</p>
<p>The schedule for the procedures stipulated in Article 1 of the supplementary regulations should be determined by order of the higher-level election authorities. However, the voting date should not be later than December 23rd. Voting for National Assembly representatives and legislators may be held simultaneously, but separate ballots and vote counts are required. However, the publication and compilation of voter lists may be combined into a single process.</p>
<p>For counties, cities, and equivalent administrative units conducting elections in accordance with Article 3 of the supplementary regulations, if the election authorities have not yet been established according to law by the date of arrival of these measures, the election affairs will be handled concurrently by the respective provincial election offices. The same applies to regional election offices for legislators that have not yet been established according to law.</p>
<p>For counties, cities, and equivalent administrative units conducting elections in accordance with Article 5 of the supplementary regulations, if elections have been conducted in two-thirds or more of the area, or among two-thirds or more of the population, the elected National Assembly representatives will have the same validity as those elected in accordance with the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law. For electoral regions or units conducting elections for legislators in accordance with the same article, if elections have been conducted in two-thirds or more of the area, or among two-thirds or more of the population, the elected legislators will have the same validity as those elected in accordance with the Legislator Election and Recall Law. For trade associations or women's organizations conducting elections in accordance with the same article, if two-thirds or more of the members are able to participate in the election, the elected National Assembly representatives and legislators will have the same validity as those elected in accordance with the respective election and recall laws.</p>
<p>Within ten days of the arrival of these measures, the election offices in each province, city, and region should report to the General Election Headquarters the names, areas, and population figures of all counties, cities, and regions that are entirely unable to conduct elections, partially unable to conduct elections, or had elections disrupted by bandits and are resuming them. The number of members of trade associations and women's organizations who are able to participate in elections should also be reported in detail to the General Election Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Urgent Recommendations for Rescuing the Current Grave Crisis</h3>
<p>— Du Zuozhou</p>
<p>War is spreading, the people are suffering, the economy is deteriorating daily, and society is being shaken to its roots. If we simply pay attention to the situation in various places, almost everywhere is filled with the phenomenon of "the people unable to make a living, complaints filling the air." How can we mitigate the current grave crisis? How can we reverse this overall situation that is gradually approaching collapse and decay? Everyone has certainly noticed that we need a major reform internally; but where this reform should begin is a major question worthy of our study.</p>
<p>Historical experience tells us that the governance, order, security, and danger of a country are often related to the corruption of its politics and the lives of its people. Looking at the bigger picture, the fundamental reason for the current instability can certainly be said to be a political problem, especially a problem of the people's livelihood. And in terms of future actions, apart from getting politics back on track and the economy back to normal, especially focusing on improving the people's livelihood, there is almost no other effective and simple path.</p>
<p>But let's not even talk about the big issue of improving the people's livelihood; today, not only are the majority of ordinary people unable to survive, but how many civil servants who are implementing national policies can survive? Today, one of the most unreasonable phenomena in politics is the distorted salary and treatment of civil servants. This unreasonable treatment seriously affects politics itself—rampant corruption and declining efficiency. Therefore, to talk about political reform, the first thing to do is to improve the treatment of civil servants. Otherwise, any high-sounding claims of clearing up officialdom and improving political efficiency are a waste of effort; any construction plans and ideals of creating a modern country are even castles in the air.</p>
<p>Some people believe that today is a time of total mobilization, and that as long as the war continues, the country will be unable to build, and the economic situation will be unable to improve. Therefore, the general population, especially civil servants, should suffer more at this time. This argument is specious. We must understand: (1) sound political and economic policies and improvement of the general national livelihood are the only prerequisites for guaranteeing military victory; (2) the people and civil servants tightening their belts and contributing to the country during wartime are one thing, while demanding a guarantee of a minimum standard of living is another, and they must never be confused.</p>
<p>As far as the situation of civil servants is concerned, today's problem is no longer whether or not to endure hardship, but rather the fundamental inability to live. The price index has long soared to eighty or ninety thousand times pre-war levels, while civil servants' salaries, before the adjustment in October, were only four or five thousand times higher; this is tantamount to forcing civil servants across the country to live on a salary that increases a few thousand-fold to meet living costs that are tens of thousands of times higher. Even if everyone adheres to the spirit of "a man of ambition does not forget that he is in danger," tightening their belts and working selflessly, they still cannot bear to see their wives crying and shivering at home. Therefore, good civil servants have no choice but to find part-time jobs to supplement their income; those who are slightly better start businesses and speculate to find a way out; those who are worse engage in embezzlement and malpractice, which is even more common; and the majority sit trapped, at a loss! Therefore, under the pressure of life, we only see the majority of civil servants becoming more and more depressed and dispirited, affecting the reduction of work efficiency; and the few who have not yet been dismissed are corrupt and lawless, unscrupulous, and help to worsen the social atmosphere. In this way, talking about getting politics on track is like a dream!</p>
<p>Furthermore, civil servants can endure hardship without complaint. But there should be consistency from top to bottom, sharing the hardship together, as the saying goes, "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," so that there is no psychological "complaint when there is injustice." But today's unequal treatment in various agencies can be said to be the epitome of "inequality" and "injustice." Just imagine: the total income of a central senior official is less than that of a bank trainee; a high-ranking general is not as good as a worker in a state-run enterprise; and the income of a university professor is not even comparable to that of a rickshaw puller; what else can be said? And just imagine: while the general civil servants are in the so-called "unable to live, unable to get sick, unable to live, unable to die" miserable situation, what kind of life are the high-ranking officials and dignitaries living? Where does their money come from? The country is so poor, and some people are indulging in extravagance and licentiousness beyond modern enjoyment. With such unequal treatment, such unequal hardship and enjoyment, how can one expect ordinary civil servants to endure hardship and serve the country selflessly? How can one boost the morale of the staff and improve the efficiency of political implementation?</p>
<p>This distorted salary problem cannot be solved by adjusting it once every three months. It is true that the government has repeatedly added to the budget to adjust civil servants' salaries, while other budget increases are not easily approved, and we should deeply understand the government's plight; but the amount of adjustment is obviously far from keeping up with the rate at which prices rise due to stimulation. In fact, it has turned into a situation where each adjustment reduces the actual salary. In the tortoise and hare race, one can still hope that the hare will stop and sleep for a while, and the tortoise will slowly climb up; but with the linear rise in prices, and the long distance between today's salary multiple and the actual cost of living index, even if the three months were changed to adjusting it once a month, it would probably not be a solution. Therefore, civil servants, after experiencing the pain of each nominal increase but actual decrease in salary, not only do not feel interested, but only feel more and more sad! But have the current leaders ever thought about these things?</p>
<p>Looking again at the general social situation, we are facing an economic collapse crisis, and how should the entire country work hard together to overcome the difficulties? In reality, the entire national economic life has fallen into an extremely chaotic and contradictory state; the perfunctory attitude in politics is nowhere more evident than in economic policy. The slogan of the frugality movement is resounding, but it is a fantasy to think that this kind of advisory exhortation will shift the prevailing extravagance and waste in society. Malignant inflation, the evils of corruption, and smuggling and fraudulent business practices have long deepened the unequal distribution of social wealth. Now, it has become such a situation: people with money have too much money, and besides speculating and hoarding, they can only spend it wildly; while people without money have to cry and suffer! The country is crying poor every day, but a look at the surface of the city shows that it is too extravagant. Take Shanghai as an example, in entertainment venues, hotels, and restaurants, which one is not full of guests, with a table costing millions? Which tailor shop doesn't have suits costing hundreds of millions already ordered? Cars are speeding by, filling the streets, not necessarily all for busy official duties; various factories are forced to close down due to power outages and reduced production, but where on Tongshu Road is there not a dazzling display of neon lights? Refugees with no clothes and no food are flocking to the Huangpu River every day, "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie corpses frozen to death," forming a tragic contrast! In short, the various strange phenomena of romantic extravagance and extreme luxury and desire here are probably unimaginable even to people living in New York and London. Today's prosperity in the market is not sustained by sound production, but by an unreasonable distribution and consumption; not by the improvement of national life, but by a very corrupt and decadent life and a luxurious and degenerate atmosphere. "Dancing on a volcano," can this situation really last for long?</p>
<p>We want to solemnly point out that this urban decadent life and luxurious and degenerate atmosphere are the biggest crisis for our country and nation; and the formation of this life and atmosphere, to put it thoroughly, is still a problem of political efficiency and economic system. In other words, precisely because there is a group of corrupt and speculative wealthy people in society, there will naturally be this kind of extravagant and decadent life and atmosphere. The former is the cause, and the latter is the effect. If we want to banish the extravagant and decadent life, we must first eliminate the opportunities for corruption and speculation, and we cannot but take drastic emergency measures in economic policy as soon as possible. Empty appeals to frugality are in vain, and will only be ridiculed by these corrupt elements who are used to extravagant and decadent lives!</p>
<p>Based on the above two major contradictory phenomena in politics and society, which are the root causes of all current crises, the author proposes that the government take the right medicine and immediately implement the following measures:</p>
<p>First, the fundamental solution to political reform should first guarantee the lives of civil servants, improve their treatment, abolish the old method of adjusting it once every three months, and adopt the regulations recently passed by the Legislative Yuan to calculate salaries according to the cost of living index, so that everyone can predict their future income and not be excessively threatened by price fluctuations. There are two major benefits to doing so: 1. "Salary" is intended to "nurture integrity." Since it can "nurture integrity," it will be easier to enforce the law to punish corruption. 2. Civil servants are spared the worry of cold and hunger, and they eliminate the resentment and injustice in their hearts due to unequal treatment, so that they can work with peace of mind and exert efficiency. In short, to achieve political integrity and enhanced efficiency, it is essential to implement index-linked salaries and improve the treatment of civil servants. This is a prerequisite for reforming politics. (Continued on page three)</p>

<h3>Seeking a Solution to the German Peace Treaty The Four Foreign Ministers Have Not Reached an Agreement The Soviet Union Firmly Opposes the Incorporation of the Saar into France The Question of German Unification Will Be the Focus of Future Meetings</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 29th Broadcast: The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference held its fifth meeting today. Secretary of State Acheson decided to find ways to continue the discussion of the relevant agenda, while ignoring the Soviet proposal to establish a German central government as soon as possible. Regarding the Soviet accusation that the United Kingdom and the United States were attempting to establish a government independently in western Germany, it is expected that Marshall will not offer a reply. The German peace treaty issue is still the main focus of today's agenda. It is generally believed that Molotov will continue to obstruct the meeting by claiming that a peace conference cannot be convened until a central government is established in Germany. As for the Austrian treaty, only the issue of German assets in Austria has not been resolved. The United States delegation supports the compromise plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, that is, using assets that clearly belonged to Germans before the war as compensation, and having Austria pay the Soviet Union a sum of US$1, so that the Austrian treaty can be drafted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement today on the French proposal to establish two expert committees to review the eastern and western borders of Germany. The Foreign Ministers Conference has now entered the most tense stage of the meeting and has begun to discuss the issue of German unification or division, while Molotov still firmly refuses to recognize the principle of incorporating the Saar region into France. Although the meeting did not reach an agreement on any issue throughout the day, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault spent a lot of time explaining to Molotov that they still supported Germany having a central government and solemnly declared that they had no plans to establish a separate government in West Germany. Molotov listed the words of Western politicians to prove that there were indeed such plans. He strongly stated that the Soviet government opposed any such plans and believed that the Foreign Ministers Conference should make it clear that it supported the establishment of a German central government. Bevin replied that the United Kingdom had never formally expressed its support for the establishment of a regional government, and the British delegation was prepared to do its best to seek understanding. He also said that the United Kingdom would continue to work to establish a German central government, but a government that was not a dictatorship. Bevin continued, although it had not yet been decided what actions the United Kingdom would take if the Four Powers did not reach an agreement, under the chaotic situation in Western Europe, Molotov could not ignore it. Bevin also strongly stated that the rule of Germany by one power would be enough to cause war, and the theory of balance of power would also cause bad consequences.</p>
<h3>Britain Proposes Four Points on Establishing a Boundary Committee</h3>
<p>Bevin then talked about his opinions on the establishment of a boundary committee and put forward four suggestions: 1. The four foreign ministers' representatives form one or several allied committees to review the territorial demands of Germany's neighboring countries on Germany; 2. These committees are composed of representatives of the Four Powers together with allies of Germany's neighboring countries, or allied countries that have sent troops to participate in the war against Germany, and representatives of countries that have a direct interest in the territorial demands; 3. These committees may conduct necessary investigations to determine the impact of the territorial demands on Germany and submit a report to the next Foreign Ministers Conference; 4. This strict construction must be implemented after the basic issues discussed at this Foreign Ministers Conference have reached an agreement. Marshall and Bidault expressed their acceptance of this suggestion, except for a reservation on the fourth statement. Molotov said that the border issue cannot be discussed at present. When talking about the issue of the German central government, Molotov repeatedly stated that without a central government, there could be no peace treaty. If other regions have plans for self-government, it can prove that other countries have no intention of reaching an agreement. Marshall replied that when the British-American zone merged, the Chiang country had suggested common cooperation from other zones, so the path to unification has been opened, and now all that is needed is for the other party to take action. Bidault said that Molotov was unwilling to answer Bidault's Saar issue and also refused to answer Molotov's comparison issue.</p>
<h3>Austria Urgently Needs Recovery Grüber Issues an Appeal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Austrian Foreign Minister Grüber delivered a speech at the lunch meeting of the British-Austrian Chamber of Commerce here today, urging the Foreign Ministers Conference to end the state of occupation of Austria. He said that Austria has been liberated and occupied for three years, like a car with four brakes, and a slight tightening of a military brake is enough to prevent Austria's recovery. He also said that if Austria can recover its oil fields, it can change its economy.</p>
<h3>Allied Reparations Commission Demands Increasing the Number of German Factories for Reparations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 29th] The Allied Reparations Commission here passed a resolution yesterday expressing dissatisfaction with the number of German factories allocated for reparations. The commission has ordered its chairman, France's L'Huyer, to submit the resolution to the Foreign Ministers Conference in order to increase the number of German factories allocated for reparations.</p>

<h3>British Fascist Leader Planning to Form New Political Party</h3>
<p>Aims to Resist Threats from International Communist Party</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Former British Fascist Union leader Mosley held a press conference in London today to announce that he and his supporters will announce the date of the formation of a new political party early next year. The 51 groups that have asked him to launch this movement have agreed to cease activities and join the new party. Among these 51 groups, there are more than a dozen right-wing groups, such as the Veterans Alliance, the British Freedom Alliance, and the British branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The purpose of the new party is to resist the threat of international communism, abolish party strife, unite national action, serve the people in times of peace, and develop Africa to help solve European problems. When asked whether this new party was a fascist organization, he replied, it is neither fascism nor democracy, as both of them were declared dead in 1939. When asked about his attitude towards treaties, Mosley replied, "I will tell the Soviet Union directly to accept the destruction of atomic weapons, accept international inspections, and withdraw from some parts of Europe that should not be occupied by the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Schumann Asks for Special Powers to Suppress Labor Unrest The French Parliament Decides to Support Government Continues to Send Troops to Coalfield Areas</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast: Paris News, the French National Assembly met today to support the Schumann Cabinet, preparing to respond to the call of the French Prime Minister, intending to grant emergency powers in order to take rapid and strong action to deal with the labor unrest instigated by the Communist Party. Communist members of parliament launched fierce attacks on the Schumann Cabinet. It was reported this morning that more troops had been sent to the coalfield area near Arras in the north. Many pro-Communist and Communist newspapers have been confiscated, including those calling on all French workers to do everything possible to "defend the Republic."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann asked the National Assembly to grant the police emergency privileges as part of the emergency measures to combat the strike of more than two million workers, led by the Communist Party, that is driving France into chaos.</p>
<p>The bill proposed by Schumann stipulates: 1. Temporarily increase police power; 2. Completely revise the strike law, enforce secret strike voting; 3. Dismiss those who are lazy and those who hinder the freedom of work. The government made military preparations at the same time as it made the above request, which shows that the government is deeply afraid of causing a civil war. Schumann said in his speech: "More and more foreigners are participating in destructive and disorderly actions, and we will not tolerate these people at all." Schumann insisted that the emergency measures must be passed today and made effective immediately. The parliament adjourned at this point.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French government has begun actual mobilization late on the 28th, preparing for civil war. The Schumann Cabinet has called up 80,000 soldiers.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] US Republican Senator Taft lashed out against the foreign aid bill in the Senate on the 28th, saying: The State Department's attitude toward the foreign aid bill is based on a completely wrong point of view. If we pass the bill, this point of view will cause the complete collapse of the United States. Although Taft criticized the State Department's plan, he also declared: He is willing to vote in favor of the $597 million aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria. He said that he would fight to reduce the long-term Marshall Plan by tens of billions. Taft said: The current situation was caused by Roosevelt and Truman's concessions to the Soviet Union during their tenure, and said that the two should bear all the responsibility for the Soviet Union's current strong position and the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for foreign relief. He also said: A self-sufficient and healthy industrial economy in Germany is extremely important for the prosperity of Europe. The dismantling of German factories proves that the Potsdam Agreement is still the basic policy of the United States towards Germany. Socialism in Western European countries is preventing the recovery of these countries, and the massive distribution of dollars is not a solution. The Senate passed two amendments, the first to allow US officials to freely collect information on the distribution of relief supplies; the second is to prohibit the use of relief funds to purchase military equipment.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Advocates Restoring Gold Coin System</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Congressman Buford declared in the House today that the United States must restore the gold standard, which is an effective cure for inflation. I will soon introduce a bill to restore private ownership of gold and adopt a gold coin system. If Congress does not take effective measures to deal with rising prices immediately, the people will no longer save.</p>
<h3>Left-Wingers Once Occupy City Hall Milan Has Returned to Normal Government Allows Left-Wing Mayor to Continue Serving</h3>
<p>[United Press, Milan, 29th] More than 10,000 left-wingers, led by wartime guerrillas, occupied Milan City Hall yesterday to protest the government's removal of the left-wing Mayor Trollo from his post. The government side confirmed that the military had ordered Milan to be placed under military control.</p>
<p>Another telegram The left-wingers occupying Milan City Hall have withdrawn voluntarily this morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Milan, 29th] Officials announced: The general strike held by Milan workers yesterday ended this morning. The wartime guerrillas who occupied the city hall have also withdrawn. After overnight negotiations between the citizens' committee that organized the strike and the military and political authorities, an understanding has been reached to allow Mr. Trollo to continue serving in the next few days. The city has now returned to normal.</p>
<h3>The Holy Land Partition Plan Vote Postponed Again: Arab States Show Signs of Compromise; Direct Negotiations Possible Between Both Parties</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 29th (Broadcast): Lake Success dispatch - Arab officials held private meetings in their residences today to discuss new compromise proposals, hoping to achieve a resolution on the Holy Land partition issue at the United Nations General Assembly. A spokesperson for the Arab delegation declined to comment, but it is widely believed that the establishment of a joint Jewish-Arab federation is a possible basis for compromise.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lucerne, 28th] The final decision on the fate of Palestine has been postponed again. The General Assembly passed a French proposal tonight, resolving to postpone the vote on the Palestine partition plan for 24 hours. Before the General Assembly decided to reschedule the meeting, China announced that it would abstain from voting on the Palestine partition plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 28th] It is reported that the French delegation discussed the possibility of taking last-minute compromise actions with several Arab delegations. Arab delegation leaders held discussions today on compromise actions. Lebanese representative Mr. Jammal visited UN General Assembly President Aranha to discuss this matter. Mr. Jammal stated that even at this last moment, compromise negotiations may still be possible. He believes that if the Arab representatives attending the UN General Assembly, rather than the Palestinian Higher Committee, directly negotiate with Jewish leaders, better results can be expected. Well-informed observers believe that some Arab countries may be seeking to buy time, while others genuinely consider the possibility of bloodshed. In any case, it is highly possible that the Arab countries will put forward a compromise proposal on the 29th. If so, the resolution on Palestine will be delayed for weeks or even months.</p>
<h3>Truman Postpones Presentation of the US Long-Term Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman is scheduled to leave Washington for a vacation in Key West, Florida, on December 3rd and return to Washington on the 8th. According to Presidential Press Secretary Ross, the President's message to Congress regarding the long-term European recovery plan will likely not be completed before the President's return. Ross also said that whether the President will recommend the establishment of a new agency to manage the long-term aid plan is still under consideration. The delay in presenting the message is due to the unresolved management issues.</p>
<h3>French World War II General Leclerc Dies in Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The Air Force announced tonight that General Leclerc, the commander of the Free French forces in North Africa and a famous general of World War II, died in a plane crash in North Africa today at the age of 46.

<h3>Japanese Armory Discovered South of Nagoya</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to official reports, Allied occupation authorities discovered a Japanese armory at Kowa, a former naval air base 30 miles south of Nagoya.

<h3>Prime Minister Katayama Solemnly Denies Rumors of a Japanese Underground Government; Admits that Feudal Forces Still Exist</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 29th] At today's plenary session of the House of Councillors, Mr. Hani Goro questioned the existence of an underground organization, saying: "Rumors say that there is an underground organization in Japan. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio has denied this, but there are indeed violent groups hindering free national elections. If the right-wing forces and violent groups that caused the war are not eradicated promptly, international trust will not be obtained."</p>
<h3>Emergency Recommendations to Save the Current Serious Crisis (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>Second, resources must be controlled, and rationing must be universal. The government should make these two tasks the core of its economic policies to enhance its ability to reasonably allocate resources and improve the economic life of the people, thereby eliminating the current state of chaos and contradiction. Regarding resources, the government should select the most important daily necessities, such as food, cotton cloth, cooking oil, soap, and cigarettes, and first implement large-scale and strict control, and implement fair and reasonable rationing, from public school teachers to the general public. With reasonable control of resources, it will be easier to prohibit all hoarding and manipulation, and prices can be expected to stabilize. At the same time, with rational rationing of certain daily necessities, everyone can live according to prescribed standards. Those in power cannot enjoy them casually, and the poor will not suffer from being unable to survive. If so, what is the use of hoarding resources? We see that Britain implemented this system during the war, which enabled them to win the war against Germany, and after the war, due to the dollar panic and severe economic crisis, the government's control of resources was even stricter than during the war. In today's British markets, even pork and eggs are subject to strict rationing. With daily needs subject to certain restrictions, even the king and prime minister cannot enjoy exceptions. The perfection of this British economic system and the spirit of the people's consistent compliance with the law from top to bottom are truly worthy of our reflection and emulation.</p>
<p>When implementing the above two measures, one may also consider that: basing salaries on the price index will sharply increase the burden on the national treasury and will inevitably repeat the cycle of inflation and price increases; China's political organization and social customs are not as advanced as Britain's, and rashly implementing resource control and rationing will inevitably result in more harm than good. These concerns are not without reason. Therefore, I further advocate:</p>
<p>Third, adjusting the treatment of public school teachers based on the cost-of-living index must be carried out simultaneously with streamlining the government and unifying the treatment of various agencies. This is not only to increase the funds available for improving treatment, but also to improve political efficiency. It is undeniable that the current central and local agencies are mostly large and bloated, with overlapping functions. Agencies with duplicate and conflicting business natures should be cut back and merged; unnecessary redundant personnel should be dismissed and transferred to other jobs. In this way, I believe that the money saved will certainly be no small amount, and using it to improve treatment will make a limited difference. Otherwise, overlapping agencies will repeatedly waste national funds and support a large number of officials who are not well-fed or warmly clothed, "chicken ribs to people", which is better to release them as soon as possible. As for the treatment of various agencies, the central government should conduct overall planning and uniform regulations based on the principles of "equal pay for equal rank" and "equal pay for equal work," so that treatment is based only on the nature of the work and the performance of the service, and not on the wealth of the agency, each determining its own level. This is the only way to break the unreasonable phenomenon of uneven labor and unequal treatment.</p>
<p>Fourth, the control and rationing of resources is indeed a complicated and heavy task, and it is inevitable to have malpractices; but we must use this system to learn the spirit of experimentation, to use drastic measures, and to build a progressive foundation for our political and economic system with the determination to break the boat. If Britain can do it, why can't we? China's modernization should catch up and should start with the transformation of politics and economy. The government and the people must cooperate effectively. The people demand security in life. The government should be responsible; since the government wants to severely punish corruption, the people should be sure to report it. As long as there is no problem in principle with a system of cultivation, there is no need to be afraid of not having a method in terms of skill. Especially in the control and rationing of resources, we should regard it as a major key to turning the entire national economy from danger to safety, allowing no success and no failure. We want to take this opportunity to shift the social atmosphere and implement genuine thrift. Under resource control, there must be no act of cunningly plundering and speculative profiteering; under the in-kind rationing system, there must be no special enjoyment of any dignitaries and wealthy classes. Only in this way can we overcome the general social psychological injustice and shift people's perceptions of the government; and only in this way can we cultivate a good atmosphere in which the whole country shares the same work and rest, sharing joys and hardships. The cooperation between the government and the people can only be established in this atmosphere, and there is no reason why any national disaster cannot be overcome.</p>
<p>The way to build a country is multifaceted. In response to the current crisis, we call for efforts to save it. In terms of political economy, the best way to prescribe the right medicine is to prescribe the right medicine. Looking at the overall situation, the military cannot end at this time, and the acceleration of currency inflation and circulation, and the increasingly fierce rise in prices, seem to be inevitable trends. Leading foreign aid is short-lived, not to mention that American loans also have other requirements. Faced with the unprecedented crisis of the country, "poverty leads to change, change leads to success," a clear-minded political effort to stabilize the economy cannot be delayed! We hope that all parties will jointly study and promote its realization! (End)</p>
<p>We would like to know how the Prime Minister will resolve this issue before the summit? Prime Minister Katayama replied: There is no secret government in Japan today, and so-called violent revolution is impossible. Since the end of the war, the grounds for undemocratic behavior that may have occurred have collapsed. However, organizations such as feudal "old men" and "rogues" cannot be said to be absent, but since the government formed its cabinet, it has worked hard to destroy such feudal organizations, and will take decisive measures in the future.</p>
<h3>The First Japanese Parliament Extends its Session for the Fourth Time to Connect with the Second Parliament</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese government requested the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives to extend their sessions for the fourth time. The House of Councillors Steering Committee, which was held on the 27th, decided to extend the session for ten days. The House of Representatives also decided to extend it for ten days. Therefore, the first parliament has been extended to December 9th, the day before the second parliament.</p>

<h3>Police Department, City Government, and Central Bank Take Responsibility for Stabilizing Prices; Jointly Form Economic Implementation Agency; Have the Right to Impose the Death Penalty on Profiteering Merchants; General Survey of Bank Notes Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of rising prices in our city, since Chairman Chiang ordered the Preparatory Department, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter, Mayor Wu, President Zhang, and Commander Xuan have made immediate decisions after days of discussion. As a result, the principle of suppressing and stabilizing prices has been determined, starting with a thorough investigation of the black market for gold and currency. In addition, two measures have been decided: 1. The Four-Bank Joint Office will tighten loans; 2. The Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank will send representatives to jointly investigate the financial dealings of all banks and businesses in the city, and pursue illegal transactions, speculative manipulations, or merchants who attempt to obtain foreign exchange based on the notes. This measure was submitted to Chairman Chiang for his personal review, and he immediately approved its implementation. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government Preparatory Department and the Central Bank sent officers on the morning of yesterday to fully launch the work of inspecting various bank notes. According to a reporter from the East China News Agency, the initial inspection yesterday has yielded clues, and prices have begun to fall across the board yesterday.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, Mayor Wu, President Zhang, Commander Xuan, and others have held several consultations and have concrete measures to suppress and stabilize prices in the city, which have been approved by the highest authorities and will be implemented soon. The city government and the Central Bank jointly launched a full-scale inspection of bank notes, which is only the first part of the measures. The biggest purpose of the price stabilization measures prepared this time is how to permanently stabilize prices in the city. In other words, it is how to prevent prices from fluctuating again. Regarding the implementation of this thorough method, the highest authorities believe that an independent agency must be effectively responsible. Therefore, they have ordered the three parties to jointly form an economic implementation agency, which is now being prepared and is expected to be formally established on December 1st. Future work will start from the root and will never be piecemeal. Finally, he also announced that the Garrison Headquarters will jointly launch effective price stabilization measures with the city government and the Central Bank tomorrow (December 1st), and will further implement them. The highest authorities fear that the implementation of the measures will be obstructed, so they have been given "national rights." The so-called "national rights" mean that the state has the right to impose the death penalty on profiteering merchants who manipulate prices. In other words, the soon-to-be-established economic implementation agency has been granted the power of resolute measures. In the future, profiteering merchants will be punished according to the General Mobilization Order Law, depending on the severity of the circumstances, and will be punished by military law. Those with serious cases will be sentenced to death, he said.</p>
<h3>Two Black Market Gold and Currency Cases Uncovered</h3>

<h3>Ji He Long Case of Illegally Obtaining Foreign Exchange to be Handed Over to the District Attorney's Office for Prosecution</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department recently uncovered a case of Ji Hehui Company at No. 27, Lane 110, Jixiang Street, illegally obtaining foreign exchange based on a secret report. The company's business scope is quite large, with the operation of imports, and code books, telegram drafts, and account books were confiscated on the spot and transferred to the liaison specialist sent by the Central Bank to be stationed at the Police Department for review. Manager Wu Chengyi and bookkeeper Chen Bonian were arrested and confessed without denial. The Police Department submitted the case to the Municipal Government for instructions. Yesterday, instructions were received that the case had been approved by the Ministry of Finance, which ordered compliance with Article 33 of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Management Regulations, which states that those who operate foreign exchange and foreign currency securities without being designated banks shall have their foreign exchange confiscated and be sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years. After receiving the order, the Police Department will hand over the entire case to the District Attorney's Office for prosecution next week.</p>
<h3>Recounting of Regional National Representative Election Tickets to be Completed Tomorrow Night; Supplementary Regulations Supporting Political Parties Have Minimal Impact</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The recounting of votes for the regional elections of the National Assembly in this city will be completed tomorrow night, and the official announcement can be made in major newspapers on the 2nd or 3rd. In addition, the supplementary regulations supporting political party candidates passed by the State Council on Thursday have no impact on the top ten representatives in this city, and have little impact even on professional groups.</p>
<h3>Perspectives of Three Party Representatives on the General Election</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) A reporter specifically asked people from the Kuomintang, the China Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party about their views on the general election, and received the following answers: 1. Kuomintang personnel believe that they have the certainty of controlling the overall situation in this election, but they still strive to win over voters in a democratic manner. Taking Shanghai as an example, candidates Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, and Wang Yao have carried out the activities that modern elections should have in an open manner, hoping to establish a good model for China's democratic politics. They have also tried their best to assist the elections of friendly parties and expressed regret for the failure of Jin Houcheng to be elected due to his lack of campaign activities. In addition, many blank and invalid votes were cast by voters in this election, which is related to the educational level of voters. Therefore, they deeply feel that if China wants to achieve democracy, it must popularize education. 2. Zhang Bo, Standing Committee Member of the China Youth Party, said: The National Assembly election in this city was orderly and there were no incidents. In the election process, friendly parties were able to understand the needs of the country today and sincerely assist, which is very satisfactory. However, the situation in other regions of the country is different. The situation in Chongqing is still good, but the situation in other places is not. We sincerely hope that all parties will cooperate to pass this general election and establish a democratic model for our country. 3. The Democratic Socialist Party has suffered a disastrous defeat in this National Assembly election. It is reported that Zhang Junmai has urgently telegraphed Nanjing, requesting the Central Committee of the Kuomintang to fulfill its guarantee of seats. The party pins high hopes on the supplementary regulations for the election of party members and candidates by the State Council the day before yesterday. However, in terms of the rankings of the National Assembly representatives in this city, among the top ten representatives elected, two are social elites and eight are nominated by political parties, which is not inconsistent with the supplementary regulations. Therefore, all parties are very concerned about how the Central Committee intends to resolve this matter.</p>

<h3>Many New Clues Obtained in the Case of Corruption by Customs Officials; More Than a Dozen People Listed on the Blacklist</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of several Jianghai Customs officials using their authority to collude with merchants and continuously commit corruption, there were important new developments yesterday. The case is serious and complicated, involving a wide range of people. After receiving secret reports and investigation reports, the highest authorities were extremely angry and approved the order of the Ministry of National Defense to strictly handle the case according to law.

<h3>Preparatory Meeting Held to Discuss the Election of Supervisory Committee Members; Opening Ceremony to be Held as Scheduled if No Clear Order is Received Before the 1st</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Civil Affairs Bureau and the Secretariat of the Municipal Council held a preparatory meeting yesterday morning to discuss matters related to the election of supervisory committee members. Director Zhang Xiaosong, Secretary-General Xiang, Chief Secretary of the Civil Affairs Bureau Li Xuexun, Chief of the First Section Chen Minshu, Chief Secretary of the Council Bu Shenghua, and Director of General Affairs Zhao Gongwang attended the meeting. The results of the discussion were that although the State Council had passed the extension of the election of supervisory committee members from December 16 to December 21 to allow the Civil Youth Party to participate in the Provincial Council, it did not express anything about participating in the Municipal Council, and the Civil Youth Party requested one-fifth of the seats, while there are only twelve supervisory committee members in this city, and the distribution of the seats is itself a problem. Therefore, it was decided not to extend the election. If there is no order before the voting date of December 7, the votes will still be counted according to the original schedule. At the same time, if no clear order is received before December 1, the opening ceremony of the election meeting will still be held at 9:00 am on the 1st. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan have agreed to the above measures.</p>

<h3>Fifty Crates of Lead Sheets Imported Through Fraud: Official-Business Collusion to Alter Bills of Lading; the Import/Export Control Commission Supports Ling Chongren and Three Others; District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution on Corruption Charges</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ling Chongren, a staff member of the Provisional Import Management Committee, Chen Ruihao, manager of Shi Lin Import Company, Zou Zichun (i.e. Zhou Zichun), representative of Yuda Company, and Tong Rongsheng, a tobacco merchant, were accused of official-business collusion, altering bills of lading, and obtaining import permits. Yesterday, the District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution. The facts of the prosecution are as follows: Shi Lin Company, located at 330 North Sichuan Road, is engaged in import and export business. Its manager, Chen Ruihao, applied to the Provisional Import Management Committee on December 6 of last year to import 200 crates of lead sheets from the United States.</p>
<p>The application was rejected. Later, on June 10 of this year, regarding 50 crates of the goods that had already been sold to Zou Zichun (i.e. Zhou Zichun), representative of Yuda Company, he still used the name of the import company to fill out an application for an import permit. The date of shipment in the application was falsely filled in as December 22, 1946, according to the Western calendar. Through the introduction of Hua Rong Sheng, with the help of Ling Chongren, a staff member of the committee, the shipment date was changed to December 22, 1946. On June 30 of this year, they received a notification from the Bank of China and obtained import permit number 000277 for 50 crates and the bill of lading. Zou Zichun and Chen Ruihao agreed to give Ling Chongren</p>
<p>Nine Crates of Lead Sheets as Compensation</p>
<p>On July 2 of this year, Zou Zichun invited Tong Rongsheng, Ling Chongren, and Chen Ruihao to a gathering at Xinghuali on Fourth Horse Road. Ling Chongren requested that the price of nine crates of lead sheets, 14 million yuan, be paid in advance. Tong Rongsheng issued a receipt for the payment, which was received and kept by Zou Zichun. The actual shipment date of these 50 crates of lead sheets was March 20 of this year. The bill of lading currently stored in the Bank of China also records the date as March 20. After Chen Ruihao and Zou Zichun obtained the import permit for these 50 crates, they altered the shipment date on the bill of lading to March 20 of this year and declared the goods at customs. The customs authorities mistakenly used</p>
<p>X-Ray Examination of the Delivery Order</p>
<p>and discovered the alteration. They reported the situation to the Import/Export Control Commission, which transferred the case to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. After investigation by Prosecutor Shen, it was determined that the defendant Ling Chongren was suspected of violating Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, as well as Article 211 of the Criminal Code. He should be punished according to the more severe provision in Article 55 of the same law. Tong Rongsheng and others were suspected of violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, as well as Article 30 of the Criminal Code and Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption. Chen Ruihao and Zou Zichun were suspected of violating Article 30 of the Criminal Code, Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, and Article 216 of the Criminal Code (applying the punishment of Article 211). They should be punished according to the more severe provision in Article 55 of the same law. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a lawsuit was filed.</p>
<h3>Pilot Strike Remains Deadlocked; Copper Sand Association's Chinese Pilots Express Refusal to Cooperate with Customs; Jin Yueshi Explains Demands Are Not Excessive</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The pilot strike incident showed no sign of resolution yesterday. The number of White Russian pilots temporarily hired by customs has increased to six, while the Chinese pilots appointed by the Maritime Administration have not reported for duty. There are a total of eighteen Chinese pilots licensed by the Ministry of Communications. Since September of this year, they have formed the Shanghai Copper Sand Pilot Association. They refuse to cooperate and have stated their unwillingness to be managed by customs. Jin Yueshi, Chairman of the Copper Sand Pilot Association, held a reception for reporters yesterday. He believes that the foreign pilots' request to increase pilotage fees is not unreasonable. An income of 60 million yuan per month is not only not "aristocratic" but is actually too low, as the monthly income of an ordinary captain of a small ocean-going vessel is 1,000 US dollars, while the qualifications of a pilot are higher than those of a captain, and the responsibilities are extremely heavy. In terms of their work value, they should receive a compensation of 1,500 US dollars per month. The shipping companies have already expressed their willingness to meet the demands of the foreign pilots, and Jin believes that the reason why customs is firmly refusing is due to political reasons. The key lies in the transfer of pilot management to the Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications starting in January of next year.</p>
<p>Ocean-going Vessels Will Not Be Disrupted</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese pilots had requested customs to allow them to work as pilots, but customs repeatedly delayed their requests. Therefore, they are unwilling to be driven by customs at this time of need. Their hopes are: (1) Customs proposes to transfer management authority; (2) The Ministry of Communications allocates funds or provides bank guarantees for loans to organize pilotage services. In this deadlocked situation, two ocean-going vessels, the "Sogretla" and "Hamram," left the port yesterday, both led by White Russian pilots. In addition, some transport ships directly contacted Chinese pilots to serve as pilots, so the transportation is not too hindered.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Store Dismissal Dispute: Employees Post Slogans and Go on Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The dismissal dispute between the fourteen jewelry stores and their employees has not been resolved. Yesterday, some employees posted slogans in front of the stores. After receiving reports, the Social Affairs Bureau believed that such actions should not be taken during the mediation period and ordered the labor union to stop them. In addition, the employees of the Jin Tiansai Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road went on a hunger strike from noon yesterday to protest the unresolved dismissal issue. The labor union is currently trying to dissuade them. It is reported that the management has expressed its willingness to accept the issuance of gold as severance pay, and the current dispute is only over the amount.</p>

<h3>Footprint Verification: Xingye Pawnshop Theft Case Solved; Large Amount of Jewelry Found in Hole</h3>

They also brought all the staff, apprentices, and old cashiers to the police station for questioning. After verifying the footprints and careful consideration, they discovered that apprentice Liu Songwen (17 years old) was highly suspected. After repeated questioning, he confessed to the theft. He said that there were 85 items, placed in a travel bag, and a hole was dug behind the escalator to bury the bag in the soil. Police were dispatched and recovered all the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Kunming Road: Police and Robbers Engage in Gunfight; One Robber Wounded, Abandons Coat and Flees</h3>
<p>(Our Report) At the Yonghe Tobacco and Paper Shop, 892 Kunming Road, at approximately 9:15 PM last night, after business hours, a person suddenly peered into the shop through a window and used the excuse of buying wine to trick the owner into opening the door. Four robbers wearing yellow uniforms and black long gowns entered one after another. Three of them brandished pistols. The shop owner, Zheng Mingquan, knew that he had been robbed and handed over several hundred thousand yuan in cash from a large cigarette box. Neighbors noticed the incident and ran out to sound the alarm and report to the Yulin Road Police Sub-Bureau. Deputy Bureau Chiefs Feng Wenwei and Yin Chunrong, along with Section Chief Shen Zuoluo, supervised Section Member Cheng Wengui, Inspector Yang Shaoxian, Sergeant Yue Mingzhong, and officers Li Zhuyin, Liu Longchao, and Tian Changyuan, rushed to the scene in police cars, surrounding and lying in ambush. Before long, a robber wearing black trousers and a yellow uniform, carrying stolen goods: Great Britain and other brands of cigarettes, opened the door and fled. At that time, the police officers shouted for them to stop. The robbers, realizing they had been discovered, abandoned all the cigarettes and cash and fled. The two robbers behind them also stepped out one after another. The police officers opened fire from a distance. The robbers also drew their guns and fired back. Both sides fought for about ten minutes, exchanging about forty shots. As a result, one robber in the rear was hit twice in the lower body, took off his outer coat, and fled, leaving a few spots of blood. Police officers collected the stolen goods, cash, and the abandoned coat, and summoned the original owner to the police station to investigate the details.</p>
<h3>No Changes in City Government Organization; Personnel Reductions Impossible; City Government Submits Statement to the Executive Yuan Explaining Reasons</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Yesterday, a reporter visited Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department of the City Government, and asked whether the City Government's staffing could be maintained as it is now that the central government has extended the authorization period for the recovery area by one year. Director Zheng replied, "This is the most basic common sense." During the authorization period, Mayor Wu can handle all municipal affairs with full authority. Director Zheng explained further, because some people still do not understand, by giving an example: If the Executive Yuan decides that the City Government's staffing must be reduced by one-third of the original number, then the Personnel Department will report the two-thirds of the City Government personnel who have been approved to the Ministry of Civil Service for review, and the remaining one-third of the personnel will become extra to the City Government's staffing. The central government will not recognize them, but Mayor Wu has the right to continue to employ them, depending on the needs of the environment. In fact, the city's business is booming; the city government has repeatedly stated that the current staff cannot be reduced, so there is no need to argue that the city government will maintain its current staffing.</p>
<p>To verify the facts, the reporter again visited Mayor Wu and asked whether the central government's order to extend the authorization period for the recovery area would apply to the city government's staffing. Mayor Wu replied, "Of course, of course."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the review committee of the City Government's organizational regulations of the Executive Yuan has completed the preliminary review of the city government's staffing issue in four sessions. Except for a slight reduction in the number of personnel, there are no changes in the organization. The Personnel and News departments will not be changed from departments to offices. Tang Honglie, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, who was responsible for the review work, sent a letter to Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department of the City Government, stating that the Ministry of Civil Service has agreed on the establishment standards for personnel agencies: for central government departments and provincial governments with more than 500 city government employees under their jurisdiction, a personnel department should be established.</p>
<p>Regarding a slight reduction in personnel, the city government has submitted a statement to the Executive Yuan explaining the heavy workload of the city government and the need for the current staff. The original letter stated: The city government plans to have 3,576 staff members according to the proposed organizational regulations, with 17,000 affiliated staff members. The number of police, laborers, and technicians, more than 20,000, is not included. The appointment, dismissal, transfer, and evaluation of the staff, and the rewards and punishments of the police, laborers, and technicians, must be submitted to the city government for approval. Based on the above standards, the Personnel Department should have 240 staff members, and the personnel offices of each bureau should have about 50 staff members or more. However, the proposed organization only provides for 60 staff members in the Personnel Department, and only 36 staff members in the A-level personnel offices of each bureau, 35 staff members in the B-level personnel offices, and 17 staff members in the C-level personnel offices. Compared with the regulations, there is a significant discrepancy. It is feared that it will be insufficient to cope with personnel management and should not be reduced further.</p>
<h3>Repatriated Overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island: Sent to Two Locations Without Accommodation; Authorities Now Negotiating Ways to Send Them Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 161 repatriated overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island are still in a state of hardship where they do not know what the next day will bring, although their food and accommodation problems have been temporarily resolved. The day before yesterday afternoon, Wen Songling of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office and Zheng Luyi of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office managed to borrow two trucks and initially sent them to Sacred Heart Hospital, proposing to send them to the former Overseas Chinese Second Reception Center on Longchang Road, but both were refused because there was no room. Finally, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request relief, but because the office hours had passed, they did not get any instructions. By this time, it was past dinner time, and Wen had no choice but to ask Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who finally agreed to have the refugees temporarily housed at the former Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road (the area is currently being renovated and will be moved into by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office). It was not until midnight that they were able to have some food to fill their stomachs. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is carefully investigating the original residences of each overseas Chinese and is asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions while consulting with the municipal authorities to send them back to their hometowns separately.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Consumer Cooperative of the City Government staff received a member from the Materials Supply Bureau who, with a formal delivery order and formal receipt, took back some of the raincoats consigned by the cooperative, totaling 300 pieces. After verifying that the procedures were in accordance with the contract, the cooperative applied to the General Affairs Office of the City Government for a permit to take out the goods. When the permit was being obtained from the bureau, a few employees of the City Government, not knowing the truth, tried to stop it. The person in charge of the cooperative presented all the documents to the mayor and made a public announcement. The General Affairs Office explained the situation to them, and the misunderstanding was cleared up.</p>
<h3>Taixing Communist Bandit Instructor Sentenced to Imprisonment for Murder</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Song Zijiang, a Communist bandit instructor and district committee member in Taixing County, Northern Jiangsu, forced fellow villagers Song Guanghua and Song Qitian to join the Fourth Army in the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year in Liujiadai, ten li outside the south gate of the county. When they refused, he stabbed Song Guanghua 27 times, killing him and leaving the body on display for three days, forbidding anyone to collect it. In September of this year, Song Zijiang secretly came to Shanghai from Northern Jiangsu. On the afternoon of the 28th, Song Shilin, the younger brother of Song Qitian, spotted him at a teahouse in Xiaodongmen and reported him to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. It was discovered that in addition to the murder in this case, Song was also guilty of destroying highways, demolishing houses, slaughtering innocent people, and robbery. The Taixing County Government had issued an arrest warrant for him. He was prosecuted for murder. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda of the Second Criminal Division of the District Court presided over the trial. Witness Song Shilin testified that in the tenth month of the 35th year of the Republic, when Song Guanghua passed through Taixing County, Song Zijiang stopped him, confiscated the pass issued by the Taixing County Government, robbed him of his personal belongings, and took him to Liujiadai, where he stabbed him 27 times all over his body with a rifle bayonet. The defendant Song Zijiang vehemently denied the charges.

The plaintiff's incidental civil suit will be handled by the Immigration Court."</p>
<h3>Transferring Thousand Kilowatts of Electricity to Restore Light to Nanshi</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The giant generator of the Zhabei Power Company in this city suddenly broke down the other day, causing a power outage in Nanshi. The power supply in Nanshi is provided by the Huashang Power Company, which relies on Zhabei, so Nanshi was indirectly affected by the breakdown of the generator in Zhabei, plunging it into darkness. The Public Utilities Bureau convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to have the Shanghai Power Company and the Pudong Power Company find ways to save 1,000 kilowatts of electricity to sell to Huashang for the use of Nanshi residents, in order to temporarily alleviate the emergency. After the meeting, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau told reporters: The lights in Nanshi may be restored last night. If there are obstacles due to circuit problems, then the lights will be restored at the latest tonight.</p>
<h3>Young Woman in Pudong Accuses Grand-Uncle of Rape: Defendant Claims He is the Clan Head and Could Not Possibly Commit Such a Bestial Act</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The case in which Sun Xiaomei, a young woman from Pudong, accused Tao Hezhong, her grand-uncle four generations removed, of rape was heard yesterday in the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court by Judge Wu Shaochang. Sun Xiaomei testified first: She is 26 years old, lives at No. 8 Lujia Lane, Pudong, and is married to Tao Chengdao, who works in a company in Shanghai. Tao Hezhong is my grand-uncle. One night in March of this year, I was coaxing my child to sleep when my grand-uncle suddenly entered, pushed the door shut with one hand, and held a gun with the other, forbidding me to make any noise. I was then raped. Afterwards, because I was afraid of his power, I did not dare to tell my husband. At noon on October 14, I was washing dishes in the kitchen when Tao broke in again, wanting to commit indecent acts. I shouted for help, and Yang Rudao, a neighbor and relative by marriage, came to rescue me. Unexpectedly, Tao instead accused Yang of having an affair with me. A scuffle broke out, and Yang reported it to the Baochang Tao Bingrong, which is how my husband found out. He said that I was unchaste and left home. Now I cannot maintain my livelihood, so I am accusing him of violating public morals. The defendant Tao Hezhong testified that he is 38 years old, lives at No. 113 Lujia Lane, Pudong. I am the clan head, how could I possibly commit such a bestial act? What Sun said is all fabricated. It is because she is unchaste, and I often lectured her, that she holds a grudge and is falsely accusing me. After Tao Bingrong and Xu Xiqi testified, the court adjourned the trial of the case and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the sixth of next month.</p>

<h3>The Northeast Fifty Days Under the Shadow</h3>
<p>An international shadow, solely on the Northeast, people internationally focused on the Northeast, but unfortunately unable to break the stalemate formed by this shadow.</p>
<p>In this shadow, the communist bandits, united with the Korean communists, and bribing the armed Mongolian brethren, constantly launched offensives, once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, turning the factories, mines, and transportation built by the Japanese and the Northeast compatriots into broken, suffocated, and unmanageable states.</p>
<p>Each offensive was more ferocious than the last, and each offensive caused more devastating destruction. The six offensives had already made transportation impossible, and the industrial and mining sectors changed color because of it. The goal of the communist bandits was: "To seize resources outside the customs, to fund disturbances inside the customs!"</p>
<p>The six offensives of the communist bandits had just ended, and the seventh offensive was about to come. Now, sketching a simple picture of the six offensives, it is judged that the upcoming seventh offensive may be similar to the six actions.</p>
<p>(Our reporter from Pan Yang on the 22nd, by airmail) It is a well-known and unspoken fact that the current four army corps of the Nationalist army in the Northeast are not enough for ideal distribution. The communist bandits know this even more clearly, so each offensive focuses on this point.</p>
<p>The prelude to the six offensives was the 8th and 9th columns of Li Yunchang's "Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region" of the bandits, who suddenly appeared in western Liaoning in early September, beginning to destroy the traffic from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, and threatening Huludao.</p>
<p>From September 6th to the 26th, for half a month, battles continued. As a result, the communist bandits suffocated several industrial and mining units in Jinxi, cut off the supply line between inside and outside the customs, Huludao was under great threat, and at the same time, the Nationalist army Wang Tiehan's troops also suffered a loss.</p>
<p>On September 28th, the sixth offensive of the bandits officially kicked off. The bandits launched a large-scale offensive between Kaiyuan and Tieling, attempting to seize the north gate of Pan Yang. Faku, sixty kilometers north of Shenyang, fell first on September 30th. The bandits further used the main force of the 7th Column to quickly besiege the west gate -- Xinmin. At the same time, Liaoyang at the south gate and Fushun at the east gate were all sending alarms.</p>
<p>At this point, the communist bandits' intention to launch a large-scale attack on Pan Yang had been formed. Coincidentally, Pan Yang was also</p>
<p>Surrounded and Attacked</p>
<p>was performing "empty city trick". The situation was indeed quite severe, because at that time, the mobile force of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps was rescuing Jinzhou. Many people sweated for this.</p>
<p>However, the mobile force was, after all, a mobile force. The Liao Corps rushed back overnight and won a victory in the darkness at Gaoshan between Xinmin Juluhe, preserving the West Gate and defending Yang.</p>
<p>According to the military负责人 of the Xing Yuan, although the battle was not big, the relationship was too big, because the battle near Xinmin changed the war situation. This was the first phase of the war from September 28th to Double Ten Festival.</p>
<p>The second phase started on October 11th. On the 21st, the communist bandits attempted to threaten Pan Yang with local troops and launched large-scale attacks on Dongqian and western Liaoning. After the bandits retreated from Xinmin, they changed to take the railway hub Xinlitun, Dahu Mountain on the Da Zheng Line, and Yixian on the Jin Gu Line. As a result, they failed to achieve complete success. At the same time, in the battles of Yingpan, Nan Zamu, and Jiguanshan outside the east gate of Fushun, the Nationalist army gained an advantage, and the bandit's 10th and 11th columns, as well as the Korean communist Li Hongguang detachment, were defeated.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nationalist army worked hard to harass Goubangzi and Dahu Mountain westward along the road by the bandit army entrenched in Yingkou Port, and achieved great success.</p>
<p>The northern road smashed the commando troops sent by the bandit's 1st Column to disrupt and destroy the joint attack between Tieling and Shenyang, which contributed to turning the tide of the battle. That was the Battle of Tieling South Guannangmi, which strategically won a great harvest in a small battle.</p>
<p>October 16th to November 18th was the third phase of the offensive. This was also the</p>
<p>Last Phase</p>
<p>Except for Hou Jingru's troops who suffered some losses in the northwest area of Yixian due to poor intelligence in order to save Beipiao, the Nationalist army won favorable results in other aspects.</p>
<p>In this phase, the bandit's plan was to continue to destroy the Bei Ning Road, but focusing on besieging Yongji and the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station. The siege began on the 16th, on a large scale, and the offensive was also fierce.</p>
<p>General Zeng Zesheng, who led his team to support bitterly, and Liang Huasheng's security team were also able to cooperate with the Nationalist army in combat. With the power of the air force, as a result, the bandits had to retreat. At the same time, the Jilin military and civilians also gained the honor of defending Jilin.</p>
<p>In the third phase, there was a new force that won a great victory, that was Fu Zuoyi's troops, which recovered Shenyang's northwest and south Zhangwu. In the triangular area west of Zhangwu, the bandit's 7th Column was beaten to pieces, with 7,000 killed or wounded, 800 captured, and military supplies sufficient to equip a division were obtained.</p>
<p>The success of the Chuan Department lies in</p>
<p>Military Secret</p>
<p>After receiving orders, officers and soldiers carried pancakes, were not restricted by diet, did not show their colors, marched urgently while gagging, and arrived at Zhangwu, just like divine soldiers descending from the sky, achieving success in one fell swoop, winning cheers from the people. Military officials were also saying: "This battle, in the sixth offensive, was the most successful battle for the Nationalist army and the most failed battle for the communist bandits." In mid-November, the entire frozen east fell into temperature, with the temperature dropping to five to several degrees below zero. The bandit's sixth offensive also pulled down the "end" curtain.</p>
<p>Li Shuzheng, Director of the U Office of the Northeast Xing Yuan, stated to reporters about the sixth offensive: "The war started on September 28th and ended on November 18th, about fifty days. The bandits used eleven columns, and there were Korean bandits, Mongolian bandits, and local troops, claiming to be 300,000 strong. The bandits died and injured 105,000, and the Nationalist army suffered 28,000 casualties. As a result, the communist bandits' offensive failed."</p>
<p>Director Li's final conclusion was: "Chief Chen's judgment was correct, and his command was decisive. He always followed the established plan of ensuring industrial and mining areas and strategic locations, fighting in reliance on cities, capturing and提 the main force of the bandit army, and concentrating superior forces to defeat the bandits one by one. As a result, the bandits were attacked and defeated and retreated!" (Special Correspondent Han Qing)</p>

<h3>Wuxi "Flying Thief" Captured in the Theater Showing Superb Skills, Light as a Swallow</h3>
<p>(Our reporter from Wuxi on the 28th) In the areas of Huai Shu Xiang and Xi He Tou in this county, a series of major theft cases occurred in early this month. It is said that the thief has superb skills of flying over eaves and walking on walls, similar to the "Swallow Li San" in Peiping. Therefore, they are all called flying thieves, and for a time, the city was in turmoil and unable to sleep peacefully. Then news came that the flying thief had been arrested and admitted to stealing without hesitation. The "flying thief" has been caught, his real name is Qin Shijing, a native of Xigong, Luoyang, Henan, he is twenty years old, wearing a suit and leather shoes, with a generous demeanor, just like a suave young man. He used to work in the news office of the 78th Division of the First Army, but recently, when the director of the office was transferred to the Security Command Force, he went alone to the Beijing-Shanghai area to make a living by stealing. On the afternoon of the 27th of this month, Wang Yiming, the leader of the first group of the criminal police team, was bathing in the Yudeci in Da Shi Qiao, when he found the "flying thief" posing as a bather, lying on the bed and sleeping soundly, with a bag of clothes next to him. Because he looked like a soldier, he was inconvenient to ask. When he entered the pool to bathe, he opened the bag of clothes and inspected it. Inside were flashlights, keys, and other miscellaneous items. Group leader Wang immediately dispatched several group members, including Shen Chuyan, to secretly tail him. Soon, he took out a jade ring from Zhu Saichang Jewelry Store behind the park and sold it, asking for one million yuan, but the store only agreed to sell it for 700,000 yuan. The thief was in a hurry. Sometimes he went to the railway station, sometimes to the city, sometimes to the cinema, and sometimes outside the city. He was very active. When Group Leader Wang and others followed him to the Daguangming Theater, the "flying thief" realized that something was wrong. In a hurry, he ran away, intending to escape, but the area around the theater was already densely guarded by voluntary police. The flying thief Qin Shijing was taken to the team for questioning. He claimed: "Because my old mother's family is in difficult living conditions and has no way to support her, I took the risk." That night, Group Leader Wang accompanied the "flying thief" to Wang Zhengqing's home in Huai Shu Xiang to identify his appearance. It was indeed the principal offender. The criminal also demonstrated his superb skills of stealing and flying away at the scene. First, he grabbed the electric pole wood and jumped up, light as a swallow. The investigation is still continuing.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Small Spy Xia Xiangde Arrested Bandit Agent Cai Rongjin and Others Apprehended</h3>
<p>(Our reporter from Jiangyin on the 28th) Xia Shaoqing, a native of Xianwan in the city, has a nephew named Xiangde (i.e. A Xiang), who is twelve years old. His father died when he was three years old, and his mother has remarried. He lives with his uncle and is currently studying in the second grade of Cangwan Elementary School.

<h3>Relics of Ji Zi's Tomb All Ancient Objects Disappeared</h3>
<p>(Our reporter from Jiangyin on the 27th) There is Ji Zi's Tomb in Shengang Town, 30 miles outside the West Gate of Jiangyin. There was a shrine in front of it, which was later changed to a shrine. It was destroyed in the tenth year of Xianfeng in Qing Dynasty. During the Tongzhi period of Qing Dynasty, Lin Daquan from He County and the Wu family donated money to rebuild it. There were five rooms in the front gate, five rooms in the Xiangtang, and three rooms in the boat. In front was a cross stele pavilion. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by fire when the Japanese invaders captured it in 1938. The cross stele was also shattered. Now, only a pile of wasteland remains. It is Ji Zi's tomb. The cross stele was originally 7 feet 7 inches high and 3 feet 2 inches wide. There were two ancient columns. It is said to be Confucius's handwriting, writing "The Tomb of Lord Yanling, a Gentleman of Birds Call." There are traces of firewood across the waist of the stele, like a belt. It is said that at the turn of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the stele suddenly broke in the middle. One night, there were wind, thunder, and rain, and the broken part reunited, and the purple mark was there. On the side of the stele, Peng Yuyu wrote a couplet: "The stars are cold at night in the gentleman's tomb, the wind and thunder protect the sage's book." This stele has a long history. During the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, Yuanzong ordered it to be written. In the fourteenth year of Dali, Xiao Ding, the governor of Runzhou, re-inscribed the stone. The stele that exists today was erected by Zhu Yan, the governor of the state, in the second year of Chongning in the Song Dynasty. From the Spring and Autumn Period to the Song Dynasty, thousands of years of ancient objects have been lost since then, and the critics regret it. He has always been loved by Shan Nan's faithful women. Since then, Taiwanese compatriots have come to the South Bank to worship, and then they bought a Guanyin statue and respectfully transported it back to Taiwan for worship.</p>

<h3>Northern Great "College of Engineering" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Binbin</p>
<p>Demonstrated by Forty Years of History. Will Find Its Final Resting Place in Cultural City</p>
<p>Second Affiliation with Peking University</p>
<p>During the period of occupation, the puppet government hoisted the five-colored flag and greatly copied Zhang Zuolin's established system for education, unifying all schools under Peking University. "Peiping University College of Engineering" thus became the "College of Engineering of the Puppet Peking University," which can be considered the second affiliation with Peking University.</p>
<p>Thus it continued for eight years (from 1938 to 1945). When the Japanese invaders surrendered and China was restored, the former capital in Cultural City, all schools resumed operations. First, a "Temporary University" was established, and the various colleges were used as branches for reorganization. "Peiping University" no longer existed. Peking University was the center, overseeing all the colleges, and the affiliation of this College of Engineering suddenly became a question.</p>
<p>Peking University originally wanted to create its own College of Engineering and was unwilling to accept it. Someone suggested that "Peking University" and "Tsinghua" jointly run it, but "Tsinghua" had its own College of Engineering and refused. As a result, it belonged to "Beiyang" and continued to operate at the original site of Prince Duan's Mansion, renamed "Beiyang University College of Engineering." This was the second connection with "Beiyang," but while eighteen years before they were "brothers shoulder to shoulder," this time Beiyang was the elder.</p>
<p>Finally Still Belonging to Peking University</p>
<p>Last summer, enrollment and classes began in both Peiping and Tianjin, professors were newly hired, and the lineup was strengthened. Students from the mainland returned one after another, and old students from the north and new students who took the entrance exam came eagerly. "Mountains and valleys flock to Jingmen," it was quite a grand occasion for a time. The first semester passed smoothly, but this spring it was suddenly rumored that enrollment would no longer be accepted, and then it was announced that it would be moved to Tianjin in stages. Later, because the factory equipment was difficult to move and the faculty and students were attached to their homes, there were many objections. Therefore, the proposal to move to Tianjin was immediately canceled and changed to affiliation with Peking University. After many twists and turns, the Ministry of Education finally ordered acceptance on August 1st, and it was restored to the "College of Engineering of Peking University," which was the third affiliation with Peking University and also its final resting place.</p>
<p>The above forty-four years of separation and reunion, joys and sorrows, are clearly explained and vividly remembered. Those who want to know the allusions of industrial education in Cultural City, and young people who want to study at the College of Engineering of this city and Peking University should all keep this for reference, which can save many visits and inquiries.</p>

<h3>China Textile Corporation Holds Joint Board Meeting Decides to Strengthen Purchase of Domestic Cotton Minister Chen Plans to Contact Government for Supply of Funds</h3>
<p>(Our Agency Report) China Textile Construction Company held a joint meeting of supervisors and directors starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The following items were discussed: The Qingdao Yarn Factory of Textile Construction Company is facing a coal shortage, which has reached a critical stage. Some work has been suspended since the day before yesterday, and a supply is urgently needed. It was resolved that Minister Chen should telegraph the Fuel Management Committee to quickly allocate 5,000 tons of coal for transportation and supply. In addition, the Fuel Management Committee's Tianjin branch currently has coal in storage. Minister Chen was also instructed to quickly allocate 2,000 tons for transportation and supply. The above coal will be partially returned after the contract for the monthly supply of 5,000 tons of coal signed by China Textile Construction Company and the Taiwan Provincial Government is implemented next month. Furthermore, if the coal from the Taiwan Provincial Government can be supplied according to the contract, then the coal needed by China Textile Construction Company in the future will certainly not be in short supply.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of domestic cotton, as of now, less than 500,000 tons have been purchased. It is necessary to strengthen the purchase, but there is a shortage of funds. Minister Chen plans to contact the government to supply funds. At the same time, it is suggested to the government that, in order to enrich the supply of cash, the relevant financial authorities should consider issuing large-denomination banknotes.</p>
<p>Regarding the year-end bonus issue, if the method of last year is followed, it will be difficult to bear the burden. This is because China Textile Construction Company has been selling cotton yarn at a fixed price according to government regulations this year, and the fixed price is even within the cost. Therefore, the profit is limited. It was resolved that Minister Chen should ask the government authorities to find a flexible solution. The following are reported matters: China Textile Construction Company has limited inventory of yarn and cloth. Most of what is currently being spun and woven is cotton yarn spun on commission, and the supply of military yarn and cloth is huge, which is difficult to meet. The loss of 20,000 bales of cotton in Shijiazhuang this time also affected the company's supply of raw cotton. Regarding the additional allocation of cotton yarn, the government's intention is to suppress the yarn and cloth market prices, which has already been effective the day before yesterday. It is decided that the market situation will be monitored in the future, and the principle of suppressing market prices will be followed. Additional allocations and sales will be made at any time when necessary.</p>
<h3>Lackluster Performance, Limited Trading of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Major investors are buying to cover losses off-market, but young investors have already emerged, but it's uncertain how much they can do.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, water yarn was as low as 395 yuan for immediate delivery and 404 yuan for forward delivery. After the opening, prices immediately fell. No. 223 and others sold, and No. 143 and others sold for immediate delivery and retreated to 383 yuan and 392 yuan. No. 148 and others bought to cover losses, and the off-market interest rate was still 2.4 and 2.85 fen. Prices once recovered to around 388 yuan and 398 yuan. No. 143 sold immediately, and off-market incentives were weak. No. 32 and others sold for forward delivery again, and prices fell to a low of 379 yuan for immediate delivery and 390 yuan for forward delivery. However, a powerful group off-market supported the prices, and No. 157 and others in the market maintained them. Prices rose slightly to 385 yuan and 395 yuan near noon. Young investors came to close out positions, and No. 45 and others sold. Prices retreated to 379 yuan and 391 yuan at the close.

Room 360 entered, and Room 550 entered first and then exited. As a result, Unified Class C fell by 700 yuan compared to the previous closing, and Classes A, B, D, and E each fell by 400 yuan. The turnover was only 4 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks turned down yesterday due to reduced off-market incentives. The Guangdong group sold, and the foreign firm group, bank group, and securities group all sold. Ewo Yarns opened at 368,000 yuan and retreated to 348,000 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, Ewo Yarns, British Union, Deutz, Wheelock, British American Tobacco, Ewo Brewery, and Steel Industry each fell by 5%. Lane Crawford fell by 10%. Shanghai Ice &amp; Cold Storage was flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>

There were a total of 321 applications. The current cotton market was not very active yesterday because national banks stopped lending, and cotton mortgage loans that were due also had to be recovered. Furthermore, due to the end of the month and the weekend, there was mutual settlement of funds, and merchants were short of funds, so transactions were stranded.</p>

<h3>Self-Provided Foreign Exchange for Goods Arriving at Port: Review Committee Meeting Discussed Procurement and Allocation Issues Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The Review Committee for Handling Goods Arriving at Port with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange without Certificates, managed by the China Trust Bureau, held its third meeting yesterday. Discussions included:</p>
<p>*   Issues regarding the price of procured goods.</p>
<p>*   Methods for allocating procured goods.</p>
<p>*   Priority purchase issues for importers/exporters or factories.</p>
<p>It is said that the above points will be studied and decided at next week's meeting.</p>
<p>Even though goods have generally fallen back in price, people's hearts are still often weak and the market can be described as having virtually no transactions. The "Rising Sun" brand, 120 number, grade A, opened in the morning with a technical drop in the selling price to 10 million yuan, but lacked any buyers. In the afternoon, the original offer was still shouted out. Finally, someone was willing to sell at 9 million yuan, but no one inquired, and the transaction did not go through.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Allocation Not Reduced</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The sugar market has recently risen, with rumors that this is due to adjustments in the allocation price and reduced allocations. However, according to the person in charge of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation: due to recent adjustments in the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar, the allocation price of all types of Taiwan sugar for this period (43rd period) has generally increased by 40,000 National Currency per dan. The allocation quota for this period has not been reduced. Because this period has uniformly switched to large bags containing 180 catties, it is equivalent to a 70% allocation compared to the small bags containing 120 catties allocated in the previous period. However, the total weight allocated is still similar to that of each period. For example, the 41st period was 2076 tons, the 42nd period was 2313 tons, and the 43rd period was 2205 tons, and it has not decreased in recent weeks.</p>

Matches also followed the downward trend, declining by 230,000 yuan. However, kerosene, due to scarcity, rose uniquely by 30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Farewell to Spring and Autumn</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper has revised its supplement plan. Starting next month, this publication will be temporarily merged into "Free Talk," and the space will be used to publish seven other weekly publications. Although this publication will, in essence, still exist, in form, we must express our regret to our readers. This publication was founded in December of the 21st year of the Republic of China and has now been in existence for a full fifteen years. During this period, it has, of course, received the support and love of many writers and readers and has also consumed the hard work of many past editors. However, unexpectedly, just fourteen months after I took over as editor, I will be saying goodbye to the readers. This is certainly a personal regret for the editor; however, looking back at the publication's founding, the content and nature have been continuously improving and innovating. It is undeniable that reform means progress. Human ancestors may have dragged tails, and primitive horses had five toes on their hooves, but you cannot say that the loss of a tail was a loss to humanity, and a single-toed hoof certainly allows for more free galloping. The merging of this publication into "Free Talk" is, in the overall editorial policy of this newspaper, no different.</p>
<p>Those who believe in fate will even believe that there is no banquet in this world that does not end. This publication is named "Spring and Autumn," and the content also occasionally includes the wind and moon poems of men of letters. The Southern Tang Emperor Li Yu had already asked, "When will the spring breeze and autumn moon end?" And spring plowing and summer weeding, autumn harvest and winter storage, the approaching winter is not also the most appropriate time for this publication to say goodbye to its readers? Moreover, the harvest of fifteen years of cultivation has already been scattered in the hearts of readers at home and abroad. The nurturing and growth of these seeds is the real responsibility that the readers of this publication have always taken care of. For example, due to the fifteen years of enlightenment and advocacy by this publication, readers in various places have either strengthened their aspirations to engage in literature and art or established the foundation for literary and artistic endeavors. Even general publications have increased the amount of space dedicated to content similar to the style of this publication. These are precisely the expectations of this publication. So, with expectations gradually being fulfilled, what does the temporary existence or non-existence of the publication in form matter?</p>
<p>Although the editor personally has not been able to do as well as the readers had hoped during this past year or so, and often delayed the manuscripts of writers, today, I can only feel remorse and ask for forgiveness. As the saying goes, "That which dims the soul is parting alone!" is the norm of human emotion, so the words of farewell inevitably carry some sadness. However, based on the two points mentioned above, this publication's temporary farewell to readers today should also be pleasant and optimistic.</p>
<p>As for the accumulated manuscripts of this publication, except for a portion of pure literature manuscripts that will be transferred to the Literature Weekly, the remaining manuscripts with return envelopes, sufficient postage, and clear addresses will be returned by the editor one by one.</p>
<p>There are also a small number of manuscript fee notification slips for this publication with unknown addresses that cannot be delivered. If any manuscripts have been published but the authors have not yet received the notification, please inform us of the detailed address as soon as possible so that we can send it out.</p>
<p>All communications related to this publication should still be sent to the Weekly Editorial Office of the Newspaper Editorial Department.</p>
<h3>National Music and National Musical Instruments</h3>
<p>— Xi Ting</p>
<p>After reading "Rebuilding Chinese Music" in this publication, I have the following opinions:</p>
<p>First of all, "musical instruments are not a synonym for music," this point must be clearly recognized. Some people believe that Chinese music must be played by Chinese musical instruments. In fact, musical instruments are originally tools for expressing music and should not have nationality. For example, the same piano and violin can play the Spanish-style "Serenade" or the Russian folk songs full of strong national character. If Chinese "national music" has its own characteristic character, then we can compose music according to this characteristic and express it with advanced and complete musical instruments. Ma Sicong's several violin "suites" are based on the tunes of Suiyuan folk songs, and He Luting's piano piece "The Cowherd's Flute" is also full of oriental flavor.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say: if Chinese musical instruments are not used, half of the color of Chinese music will be lost. In fact, what is lost is not Chinese color but primitive color. Because authentic national music refers to ancient court music, which is characterized by simplicity and primitiveness. This simple and primitive ancient music is similar to the primitive music of any country. European music, which has progressed to such a degree today, did not have harmony or counterpoint in its early stages hundreds of years ago, and its musical instruments were also extremely simple and immature. The ancestor of the piano was the monochord, and the ancestor of the violin was the Lery, similar to our pipa. If they had always been obsessed with antiquity, they would not have such complete instruments as the piano and violin today.</p>
<p>As for the issue of improving musical instruments, it has been shouted for a long time, and it has also been partially implemented, but because our music has been stagnant for too long, even if we can cover up several centuries in one fell swoop, the result of the improvement will only be similar to advanced musical instruments.</p>
<p>Why are Western musical instruments advanced and complete? Because it can use "harmony" without restriction, and modulation is completely free (the pipa in national music only has a few harmonies). It can express melancholy and contemplative tunes. It can also play extremely rapid melodies, showing the heroic spirit of ten thousand horses galloping. It can solo folk songs, perform chamber music, but it can also be arranged into such a huge organization as an orchestra. Due to the seriousness and precision of the materials and structure used in Western musical instruments, their range, volume, and timbre are indeed incomparable to those of national musical instruments. Based on the above reasons, the so-called Western musical instruments of today have become the world's common musical instruments.</p>
<p>Secondly, it should be mentioned that our ancestors' understanding of music theory was not inferior to later generations. Zhu Zaiyu of the Ming Dynasty advocated the use of "twelve-tone equal temperament" (dividing the octave into twelve equal parts) "scale system," which is still commonly used worldwide. This is admired by Western musicians. Therefore, I feel that if we can use Western principles in "harmony," "counterpoint," "form," and "instrumentation," and pay attention to expressing the spirit of our national music, then the future of Chinese music will no longer be as primitive and simple as it is today.</p>
<h3>Self-Inscription on a Southern Travel Picture</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic, I traveled south to the Malay Peninsula, where there are many coconut trees, which can reach the sky. In the Kuala Lumpur area, tens of millions of swallows form flocks and sweep across the shore from time to time, shaking the world with their sound. More than ten years have passed, and I still remember the scenery. Therefore, I made a picture of my southern travels and inscribed it with a poem.</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of waves, autumn in the sea country,</p>
<p>For ten years the sails recall the previous journey:</p>
<p>Flocks of swallows sweep across the shore with a sound like thunder,</p>
<p>Coconut leaves reach for the sky, emerald and flowing;</p>
<p>King Zhao's tax, laid out like chess pieces,</p>
<p>Zheng He's boat, urged on by drums and lit by lamps,</p>
<p>Middle-aged sorrows and joys are worth savoring,</p>
<p>And now I, with white hair, try to recreate my southern journey.</p>
<h3>After Viewing Mr. Fang's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Dui</p>
<p>Having undergone formal training, accumulated rich experience, and cultivated noble refinement, the achievements of contemporary painters like Mr. Fang Jian can be said to be worthy of the author. From her recent works, each piece expresses pure and skilled technique, but everywhere reveals the meaning of Chinese cultural characteristics, not only in terms of subject matter but also in the artistic conception and spirit, showing the wonderfulness of tranquility and transcendence. It is definitely not the form of Western painting that slavishly imitates, nor is it simply a mixing of some Chinese painting elements in a local way. Even in terms of form, such as her "After Bathing" piece, the half-round gauze window depicted reflects the dense green bamboo; in the "Facing the Stream" piece, the lakeside rocks and willows, and the lotus emerging from the water, clearly integrate the beauty of heaven and man. The paintings wash away vulgarity with elegance and leave a weighty impression in people's minds. Even laymen should feel that they are different from the vulgar. The various pieces she wrote while traveling, the majesty of the northern lands, and the excellence of the southern states, are all captured in her brushstrokes. Each kind of police affair is only presented with its characteristics on the outer appearance, giving people a refreshing feeling. It avoids the disease of repeating the same old routines. What is most fascinating is the landscape, figures, flowers, and fruits drawn on Chinese paper, purely with vigorous brushstrokes, bold dyeing, and development of vivid interest. These are the advantages that Chinese literati have exhausted and can completely grasp. It can be seen that the realm of painting can be innovated and constantly emerge.</p>
<h3>Literary Commentary on "Spring and Autumn" Supplement</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>The earliest newspapers were very simple. Not only was there no term for "supplement," but also literary texts with an artistic air were nowhere to be found. This newspaper was the first to publish this kind of soft text. In the founding regulations of this newspaper, it was said: "If there are poets and writers who are willing to teach us with short or long articles, such as local folk songs and long poems about events from famous areas around the world, no fees will be charged." This was a call for submissions. However, at that time, no fees were given for submissions and no advertising fees were charged, which was considered a special favor.</p>
<p>The call for submissions was very effective. Many literati sent in poems and small essays, mostly folk songs, poems about immortals, and poems about climbing high places, which can be called the era of folk songs. In the recent five years (the commemorative book of the 50th anniversary of this newspaper), Lei Jinwen described the situation at that time, saying: "They sang and echoed each other, chattering endlessly, either depicting emotions or lingering on scenery. They mutually recited elegance and occupied the literary world, and countless prominent scholars all took it as an honor to have their names appended to the end of the newspaper." The newspaper's space could not accommodate it, so another "Trivial Records of Bamboo Branches" was published to accommodate it. This type of text could very well match the stuffy mood of the literati at that time and was very helpful for the newspaper's business. Although supplementary text was published immediately after the founding of this newspaper, it was not given a fixed place and did not have the form of a supplement. This can be said to be the gestation period of the supplement.</p>
<p>Since the supplementary text was welcomed by readers, the space was increased and the scope was expanded. At that time, the themes of novels, notes, etc. had replaced the status of poems in the past, so it can be called the "era of novels." In 1911, the founding of "Free Talk" further defined the form of the supplement, facing the society from start to finish, becoming the standard form of the newspaper.</p>
<p>The early supplementary text was mostly games and sketches. Although it had the form of literature, it lacked the value of literature. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, "Free Talk" once became a place for members of the Nanshe Society to publish their poems and articles.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, "Free Talk" underwent a sudden change, turning to the path of new literature. "Free Talk" changed at any time, but the original style of "Free Talk" was not affected, but only transferred its position. This publication "Spring and Autumn" was the new garden that was opened up at that time. Some people divide supplements into two factions, North and South. The Southern faction admires leisure and mostly talks about wind and moon; the Northern faction values literature and likes to talk about social events. In this way, "Free Talk" at that time should be the Northern faction, and "Spring and Autumn" belonged to the Southern faction.</p>
<p>After the restoration, "Spring and Autumn" and "Free Talk" have changed places. "Free Talk" has restored the style of miscellaneous talk in name and in fact, and "Spring and Autumn" has become a purely literary supplement.</p>
<p>Literature has no boundaries of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. The text of newspapers is also different from that of magazines. It must take into account the preferences of most readers. Although literature is a part of art, it can be expanded to the whole of art. The literature in newspapers should be this kind of broad literature, which can meet the interests of many readers. Therefore, general commentators believe that "the development of the Northern faction of supplements must tend to spiritual appreciation, with works of literature, music, calligraphy, painting, bronze inscriptions, archaeology, sculpture, art, etc. as the main content." This is exactly the style of the current Spring and Autumn.</p>
<p>This kind of broad and comprehensive literature, from the slanting of beauty in many aspects, tempers the spirit of life, increases the interest in life, and creates new vitality in life. This pure literature is more powerful, because pure literary works seem to be refined and rare, and there is bound to be a feeling of few people being able to sing in tune.</p>

<h3>Quatrains on West Mountain, Lake Dongting</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>This summer, on June 27th, at the invitation of my friend Wen Da, a monk, I traveled to West Mountain in Dongting with my two brothers, Yan Qiao and Xiao Qing. I took a leisurely trip for three days, extensively viewing the summer resorts of Linwu Cave and the scenic spots of Shigong Mountain. Wherever I went, worldly concerns were abandoned, and I casually composed poems, briefly recording the traces of my journey.</p>
<p>Gathering in the Zen hall is particularly quiet,</p>
<p>On cool nights, cutting candles and talking about life;</p>
<p>On the banana leaves, the pattering rain,</p>
<p>In my dreams, I seem to hear the sound of broken jade.</p>
<p>Stumbling from tea to wine,</p>
<p>Clear words emerge like a spring;</p>
<p>Just because I greedily listened to the banana rain,</p>
<p>I mistakenly slept half the night in the empty hall.</p>
<p>Lodged in Baoshan Temple, talking with the monk Wen Da and my two brothers, Qiao and Qing, in the Da Yun Hall at night. It rained both nights, and the sound of the rain hitting the banana leaves sounded like broken jade, which I listened to without fatigue.</p>
<p>Strange rocks split the air, like the work of ghosts and gods,</p>
<p>Heaven opens a line, sighing at the wonder of nature;</p>
<p>First ascend to Fengnong Peak, then</p>
<p>Climb up to the top of the cliff and knock on the blue dome.</p>
<p>Each step is difficult, each step is sad,</p>
<p>But you must still muster courage and not hesitate;</p>
<p>My old man's waist and feet are still as before,</p>
<p>I want to go to the very top of Emei Rock.</p>
<p>Fengnong is one of the famous scenic spots of Shigong Mountain. The dangerous cliff is split, more than a fathom high, and only about two feet wide, allowing only one person to climb up; the monk Wen Da mustered courage to ascend first, followed by my two brothers, Xiao Qing and I, while my brother Yan Qiao looked at it and retreated.</p>
<p>In the quiet, I only hear the sound of oars,</p>
<p>The light boat seems to be traveling in a book;</p>
<p>May this heart be like the bright moon,</p>
<p>Not waiting for the moon to be bright in front of Yuelu Slope.</p>
<p>At the foot of Shigong Mountain, there is a flat slope extending into the water, which can accommodate hundreds of people sitting on it. Singing on it on a moonlit night must be a beautiful experience.</p>
<p>The rising sun of Yanggu spits out light,</p>
<p>The setting sun of Yuyuan is dim again;</p>
<p>In this age of mutual torment and harm,</p>
<p>I sing and cry under the desolate mountains and lakes.</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains are truly beautiful, but human plans are not hidden, the beans are boiled with their stalks, and I don't know where it all ends? After climbing, I wept profusely.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Chief Hekken, the vehicle is ready."</p>
<p>Hekken had just received a break order and was about to borrow the telephone to say a few words to his subordinates when someone behind him greeted Hekken. "A self-propelled army? It's more like a prisoner transport!" Hekken thought to himself, turned around, and saw a young man dressed as a lower-ranking duty officer, wearing a duty armband on his arm, raising his hand to his brow in a salute.</p>
<p>"Oh, is Ueno Park very far from here?" Hekken was in plain clothes, so he didn't raise his hand, but just nodded, deliberately asking this.</p>
<p>"It's only a few blocks away, not very far." The duty officer stood straight, very respectful, because Hekken's official position was several levels higher than his, and he was also a high-ranking official on special assignment.</p>
<p>"I haven't been back to Tokyo for many days. I want to admire the night view of Ueno Park and the surrounding streets - unless there is a special order, I have to take the vehicle." Hekken's attitude contained a bit of anger, a bit of stubbornness, and a bit of arrogance. The tone of his voice seemed to say that even if there was an order from his superiors, he would still prefer to walk.</p>
<p>"There was a phone call from number twelve, ordering subordinates to send the chief to the Shin-bashi Building by vehicle; for fear..." The young duty officer changed his tone.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Hekken was a little surprised because he saw that this young duty officer actually accepted the order from "zero twelve," so he was naturally "one of us."</p>
<p>"The situation is more tense than it was a few days ago; each sect and faction is probably going to concentrate the situation of fighting each other on the chief so as to shift the focus of the other side...!" The duty officer stated this very sincerely, but his words were stopped by Hekken's gesture.</p>
<p>"Ha... a joke! That's absolutely impossible. What is a small telecommunications director? Is it worth it for those big shots to move?" These two sentences of Hekken expressed the infinite grievances hidden in his chest.</p>
<p>"Chief!" The young duty officer intensified the tension in his tone; "The situation is like this: The senior figures of each party and faction have been mobilized because of the expedition to the mainland, and there is no problem with the destruction of China; the time will be very short, there will be no great sacrifices, let alone great dangers, so they are all in the country, fighting for power and profit, and very busy. They may not necessarily pay attention to the chief. At most, there is just some jealousy because the chief's sect is different..."</p>
<p>"That's right, it can be seen that I am not in any danger and there is no need to send someone to protect me!" Hekken interrupted the duty officer's words.</p>
<p>Hekken, in the position of the head of a secret group and as a senior officer, originally did not need to be so verbose when talking to his subordinates. But Hekken's style was somewhat different from others; he paid close attention to his trusted subordinates, even if they were of a lower rank; moreover, this young man was mostly a newcomer, so of course he had to take the opportunity to say a few more words to examine the young man.</p>
<h3>Imitating the Landscape of Shi Xi</h3>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Humorous Talk About Beards</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Looking in the mirror, I suddenly saw several strands of beard sprouting above and below my mouth. Am I getting old?</p>
<p>According to the dictionary: The mustache above the mouth is called "zi," and the beard below is called "xu." The cheek hair is called "ran," and the jaw hair is called "shao." They are collectively called beards. Zi means facial hair.</p>
<p>Side whiskers, whiskers beside the neck, are indeed signs of getting old. As the saying goes: "A person without hair on his mouth is unreliable." Young people often write a few years older on their resumes when applying for jobs. Otherwise, it seems difficult to appear experienced, stable in handling affairs, and gain people's trust.</p>
<p>Usually, a man's beauty lies in his eyebrows. However, today, most people hate beards. Some even apply hair removal cream to make them fall out. Or even pluck them out one by one with small tweezers. Looking at it from a distance, it looks like a bare mountain, smooth and shiny; looking at it closely, it is rugged and uneven, with holes and scars. Han Yu's poem: "Like picking whiskers from the bottom of a locked box." Li Yishan's poem: "Ashamed to see silk in the mirror." Chen Shidao's poem: "Lying down and picking whiskers with a blue steel sword." Wang Yu's poem: "The old farmer has nothing to do, pluck his whiskers in the mirror." It can be seen that the custom of plucking whiskers has existed since ancient times, but it is even more intense today. However, after all, it is "wildfire cannot burn it all, the spring breeze blows and it grows again." "The fragrant grass in front of the steps grows again."</p>
<p>Beards are the contours of age. Sima Guang's poem: "Black whiskers grow like parasitic white whiskers, every autumn and autumn worry?" People are old and near eccentricity, most of them are not hit, the words say: "Teach my brother to plant whiskers, pierce holes everywhere with a cone, and insert horsehair." There are ways to plant whiskers, but it is an inevitable joke.</p>
<p>Zuo Zhuan: "As for King Ling, he was born with whiskers." Tang painting Li Guangbi Biography: "Guangbi's mother had a long beard of ten, about five inches long, opposite the Korean lady." I think these are "hooked whiskers and egg hair," absurd and untenable. Xunzi said: "Hooks have barbs, eggs have hair, these are difficult to hold."</p>
<p>Yu Si's appearance is very beardy, commonly known as connected beard Yu. The story says, "Yu Si, Yu Si, abandon the armor and come again." Once, I taught at a school and said to the students: "Yu Si, Yu Si, what does he look like?" One of them blurted out: "Not as good as..." At this point, everyone burst into laughter. I also laughed. It can be said to be a wonderful metaphor for Yu Si.</p>
<p>I remember that two poets, A and B, met on the road. A had a connected beard, and B was nearsighted. In order to show off each other's talents, A recited a poem in front of B: "Your eyes are so strange, you ask who is by your side? Sunlight leaks through the paper, you always see ducks, the moon moves the flower shadow, you pick up firewood branches. You wear out your nose looking at the murals, you get your eyebrows caught in the locked bookcase, and there is something even more ridiculous: you burn off the skin of your mouth blowing out the lamp!" B listened and was not willing to show weakness. Seeing that A was a beardy man, he followed the original rhyme and recited a poem: "Why is your beard so strange? Not like a sheep, but like who? After the rain, you throw jade dew in your chest; when the wind comes, you dance flower branches all over your face. To distinguish between high and low, you respect the hair, if you talk about density, how can it be compared to the eyebrows? You are not afraid of fists coming to your cheeks, relying on it to cover the skin next to the rain." Hearing this, someone "angered and hair could move the crown, and would tooth whiskers not allow not to翘?"</p>
<p>In terms of ethnicity, Chinese people have fewer beards. Eight or nine out of ten of the short slaves in the East are with hooked noses. I have never seen a Western man with a connected beard. It is said that Mussolini shaved at least once a day. All blades that have been shaved cannot be used, so their hardness can be known!</p>
<p>When I was young, I liked to watch my father pluck his whiskers. In the study, he would read books and pluck his whiskers, almost every day. Since the July 7th Incident, I have sometimes found that my father's mouth and head are full of whiskers. And the color is dark yellow, as if about to turn white. One day, I ventured to ask him why he didn't do the "cleaning" as he used to? He sighed and said, "Only after having enough food and clothing can one know honor and disgrace. In this year, whiskers and such, I can't afford to take care of them." In today's society, I believe that many people would agree with these words.</p>
<h3>Orange Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiang</p>
<p>As autumn turns to winter nights, oranges dominate the fruit market!</p>
<p>Regarding the meaning of "orange," Li Shizhen stated: "The character '橘' (ju, orange) comes from '　' (qing), generally meaning five colors for celebration, two colors for 　, 　meaning red outside and yellow inside, not smoke nor mist, but a lush and abundant image. The orange fruit is red outside and yellow inside, and when sliced, a misty and fragrant aroma arises, resembling 　clouds. The '橘' character's derivation from '　' probably takes this meaning."</p>
<p>As early as the Xia Dynasty under Yu the Great, oranges were already well-known. The "Book of Documents: Yu Gong" records: "Yangzhou's 　, wrapped oranges, pomelos, and tin are tributes." At that time, oranges were already wrapped like Flag oranges. Some say that the "Book of Documents" was forged by Han Confucians, but during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Jiaozhi already had an orange official with a rank of 200 shi, in charge of providing imperial oranges. Oranges gained their fame in China very early.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, during the Qing Dynasty, Tiaozhou, Taicang, Jiaxing, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Jinhua were all known for orange production. But now, only Huangyan and Quzhou remain. Produce changes with the times. Chinese historical records are detailed, but they neglect economic aspects. Planting oranges is suitable for saline-alkali land near rivers and seas. If the soil is fertile, the fruits will be sweet and abundant. Huangyan oranges are famous because of good seeds and suitable soil. Whether Quzhou oranges or Fuzhou oranges, their quality is surpassed by Huangyan oranges.</p>
<p>Oranges are divided into yellow oranges, flat oranges, cotton oranges, oil oranges, frozen oranges, etc. Flat oranges probably refer to today's mandarin oranges. Oil oranges have a skin that resembles an oily finish, a hard center and a black exterior. When sliced, they are not fragrant and tasteless, making them the worst among oranges. Huangyan oranges begin to bloom white flowers in August, when other oranges have finished. Frozen oranges bear fruit in ice and snow and are harvested in February or March of the following year. Although the fruits are small, they are very sweet. Eating oranges is best avoided with crabs. Eating them together easily makes ten guests feel weak and paralyzed.</p>
<p>The ancients often mistakenly identified citrus fruits, confusing green oranges with sweet citrus fruits. Mei Yaochen had this kind of joke. He wrote a poem saying: "In the past, I mistakenly identified them in Jingzhou, now I am confused by the Yue old man, yellow citrus and green oranges, like jasper and jade." It is said that Zeng Zigu was not good at poetry, but in his poem about oranges, there is also one:</p>
<p>"Slicing reveals a Sui pearl, drunk and joyful, cinnabar green hands falling dust, who has the strength like Huang 　, picking all the stars down."</p>
<p>Judging by diplomatic skill, during the Warring States period, Qi State's Yan Zi was a capable envoy. "Yan Zi was sent to Chu. The King of Chu gave Yan Zi wine. As the wine warmed, two officials bound a man and brought him before the King. The King said: 'What does the bound one do?' They replied: 'He is a Qi man, imprisoned for theft.' The King looked at Yan Zi and smiled, saying: 'Qi people are inherently good at stealing!' Yan Zi left his seat and replied: 'I have heard that oranges grown in Huainan are oranges, but across the Huai River, they become trifoliate oranges. Now, this man grew up in Qi and did not steal, but entering Chu, he steals. Could it be that the water and soil of Chu make people good at stealing?' The King of Chu was ashamed and submitted!" Twin fruits are still visible now, but the same plant bearing oranges and trifoliate oranges no longer exists. But in the Liang and Song Dynasties, one fruit bearing thirty or twelve fruits was often recorded. In the imperial era, this was an auspicious sign for the country. Now that botany is developed, if such an event occurs, it can be rewarded. It is not very difficult for botanists to cultivate them diligently.</p>
<h3>The Music of Nature</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>In the early summer of last year, I temporarily 　桓at a church university in Yangshupu. 　　At that time, although there were many broken 　walls and ruins everywhere, it was still a higher education institution, and those I met day and night were all people who "read the books of sages," so there was a clear distinction between elegance and vulgarity compared to the city 　life.</p>
<p>I lived in a dormitory for single male teachers, surrounded by lush flowers and trees, with a small garden-like atmosphere. However, since all the residents were single, it was cool and lonely. Considering the scenery and emotions, it is not difficult to understand. Next to the dormitory lawn, there was a sunken basin of about ten feet in circumference. After the rain, it accumulated water to a foot deep, forming a pool. There were countless frogs in the pool, swimming in and jumping out, 　naturally treating the pool as a paradise. The scene was even more lively when the lights came on. Thousands of frogs, led by a louder old frog, resonated in unison, noisy and loud, never stopping all night. They sang with great enthusiasm and even ran and jumped, as if singing and dancing, one can imagine their joy. This not only broke the loneliness of the single occupants in the dormitory but also, at first, they disliked the 　noise too much, making it a major threat to people's sleep, turning good dreams into a mixed mess. Later, they gradually got used to it and treated it as a natural 　　concert, sometimes even using it as a lullaby.</p>
<p>At that time, I remembered the roaring of tigers in the mountains and forests, and the bird language on Flower 　Island. In general, all living beings in the world can sing, not just the croaking of frogs. The Greek scholar Anaximander had an even deeper insight into this. He said: "All the sounds in the universe are in rhythm. The crashing of waves, the blowing of rapid wind, the circulation of blood, 　　virtue moves, the sounds produced by these, although subtle and indistinguishable, all have 　rhythm. Even when two sexes 　love, the passion boils, the blood rushes 　beyond the ordinary, and the rhythm produced is also unique." Based on the above,</p>
<p>I would carefully listen and distinguish: the croaking of frogs in the water, the 　　on the branches, the birds 　in between, the 　sound of the Huangpu River, 　each has its own rhythmic tones. That was my intersection with various pleasant sounds on campus, which I could not name, so I named it the music of nature, which still leaves me with 　pleasant memories.</p>
<h3>Random Notes Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>Praise in the Morning, Curse in the Evening</p>
<p>Criticism is often difficult to be fair. It is either praise or curse. Qing Dynasty person Yuan Mingzi wrote in "Miscellaneous Records of the Scholars" about Yuan Mei: "Zicai's poems and prose are quick-witted and always new, especially 　praising the younger generation. Short chapters and fragments are praised endlessly. For a time, many literati followed him, and officials 　were fortunate to meet him. Korea and Ryukyu competed to buy his poems. However, his reputation declined sharply after his death, and scholars criticized him, but could not abandon him. One of his students privately engraved a seal that said: 'Student under the Gate of Suiyuan'. After Yuan died, the critics rose day by day, so he re-engraved the seal and said: 'Regretting being a student under the Gate of Suiyuan'." Zhang Wentao (Chuanshan) initially named his poems "Collection of Yuan," but later changed the name. The difference in 　praise before and after for the same person is like this. Even Pan Pan Dafang like Chuanshan could not avoid being vulgar, so others are even more imaginable.</p>
<p>Today's literary world also emphasizes fame over works, so the object of criticism often involves the person and their origin, age, and even physical shortcomings, while the work is secondary, or even forgotten. For various reasons, the phenomenon of praise in the morning and curse in the evening often occurs. It can be seen that ancient and modern literati are the same!</p>
<h3>The Malady of Legal Tender for Thirteen Years</h3>
<p>— Ding Rongguan</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago! That is, on November 3, 1935, the financial reform order of the Chinese government during the era of writing was promulgated, and from then on, the coins and banknotes that varied in form and governance in each province tended to be uniform. This move opened up an unprecedented and brilliant record of unification in the history of our country's currency. Due to the outstanding credit, the eight-year War of Resistance: the unification of government orders, the stability of the economy, and the supply of military funds were all able to proceed without hindrance. Some say: without the currency reform thirteen years ago, the long-term decision for the War of Resistance, which was suddenly faced one and a half years later after the reform, could not have been made; and the victory of the War of Resistance was no less than a bloody battle between the legal tender against the Japanese yen and the puppet reserve coupons. The achievements of the legal 　are so great that it is not an exaggeration for us to attribute the fruits of victory to the success of the pre-war currency reform. The contribution of the legal tender to the nation and the country can even be described as benevolent and righteous!</p>
<p>It is a pity that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the legal tender did not retire with the victory. For two years, the supply and demand of recovery, the continuation of the suppression of chaos, and even the pushing of waves and assistance of bureaucratic capital inflation; the reputation of the legal tender has been declining like a river, once it starts, it cannot be stopped. The heroes who were once praised by the whole country and unanimously praised by everyone have now become criminals who are seen as unforgivable by all. The price index has been soaring, and the devaluation of the legal tender has been falling to the bottom. At first, it was a mathematical progression, then a geometric progression, and finally an astronomical figure! Before the war, the legal tender was stable at a ratio of 30 US dollars per 100 legal tenders. Now the US exchange benchmark is adjusted at any time, and recently it has reached a shocking distance of 73,000 yuan. The great disaster of the coming days is just beginning: before the war, large bills of 50 yuan and 100 yuan were called large, but now 10,000 yuan and the rumored 50,000 yuan are not considered large. The changes in the legal tender are so drastic that it is impossible not to feel the vicissitudes of the past and present!</p>
<p>However, the legal tender is innocent! This is not its fault, everything is due to human causes. The legal tender currently still alleviates the government's difficulties in balancing revenue and expenditure, and its malignant expansion has not yet reached the stage of the "mark" in the first post-war or the "kopeck" in this post-war era. Even if the consequences are not difficult to imagine, now, the lessons of the past can be learned, and the same mistakes should not be repeated. Reining in the horse at the edge of the cliff can save the situation from collapsing. Facing the thirteenth anniversary of the creation of the legal tender, we 　think of the past and plan for the future, learning from the past and preventing future mistakes. It is not without meaning to put forward the appeal of "Save the Legal Tender!" and "Rescue the Legal Tender!"</p>
<h3>Streets of Boston</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qi</p>
<p>Boston is located in the northeast corner of the United States, on the Atlantic coast, a bustling commercial center, like an important port city like Shanghai. The city of Boston is made up of many towns. Each town has its own center. The streets run in different directions, spreading out like a spider web. The street names are taken from past well-known figures, unlike New York where it is easy to identify First Street and Second Street. When I asked for directions on the road, an old man told me that there was a saying in Boston that the paving of all city streets followed the direction of the trampling of oxen, so it was not easy to find. Sometimes after walking some distance, the rumor really seems believable. In Boston, there is Washington Street, and in 　Lin City, Niutou City, and Somowei City, etc., there are also Washington Streets. In the same city, there are even complex street names such as Harvard Street, Harvard Avenue, and Harvard Place. This is definitely a headache for outsiders who come here for the first time. There are buses, streetcars, and subways in the city. Paying a dime can get on any car, and you can transfer to another car midway until you reach your destination without paying extra, so transportation is quite convenient, but the streets are winding and complex, making it difficult to identify.</p>
<h3>Heavy Frost</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>Once White Dew has passed, frost and snow are even closer. Liu Xi in "Explanations of Terms" says: "Frost is loss." This definitely has this kind of power over plants. Only Yang Wanli's poem "Frost at Dawn" describes it with great charm. He says: "The desolate sun searches for autumn light, the slight clamor breaks the dawn mist, only the Jiang maple is particularly pleased, kneading the frost water at night to dye its red clothes." Most poets lament autumn, but Yang Wanli's poem is an exception.</p>
<p>It is said that there is no frost or dew on high mountains. I verified this on Tianmu Mountain in western Zhejiang and it is true. Tianmu Mountain is 1,547 feet above sea level. When getting up in the morning and walking through the woods, there is no frost or dew. The reason is probably that the altitude is too high, the air is clear and the wind is strong. Although there is a slight mist, it is blown away by the mountain wind, so there is no frost or dew. However, high mountains are the first to suffer when it snows.</p>
<p>June Snow is the name of a play about wrongful imprisonment, but June Frost is the same. Huainanzi says: "Zou Yan served King Hui of Liang with loyalty. Those around him slandered him, and the king imprisoned him. Yan looked up to the sky and cried, and in the fifth month of summer, frost fell from the sky." In ancient books, the correspondence between heaven and man is like this. Wrongful imprisonment cannot be said to be non-existent now, but I don't know if crying is effective anymore.</p>
<p>In erotic poetry, such as Nen Zhenzi's poem about Jinling, it says: "At the end of the year, 　officials barely protect themselves, and in the high sun, Qing Nu still continues to display." Cang Guan speaks of pine, Qing Nu speaks of frost. This kind of imagination can be called amazing.</p>
<p>When dew is about to fall, the partridge birds in the water village first fly in groups and cry loudly. Animals fear the cold so much. People like partridges are probably not in short supply!</p>
<h3>One Week in Film</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>Cuckoos Sing Everywhere</p>
<p>The heroine of "Cuckoos Sing Everywhere," Lin Chuqing, was seduced by the businessman Song 　Yu and became his jealous wife. When she could not bear the bullying of Song's wife, she resolutely left and remarried the "Women's Issues" expert Zhang Weiqing. As a result, she committed suicide by poison because she could not obtain Zhang's understanding. Overall, the author attempts to portray the experiences of an unfortunate woman who has taken the wrong path. There are indeed many such stories in real society, but the author only presents the story without critically analyzing and pointing out the 　knot of the problem. He even describes Song Shiyu as so kind, as if all the blame should be borne by Song's wife. But he forgot that Song's wife is also a pitiful deceived person. She and Lin Chuqing are only fifty steps and a hundred steps apart, and the real culprit, Song Shiyu, is lightly let off, and even receives sympathy instead. Furthermore, the so-called "Women's Issues" expert Zhang Weiqing is even more of a quack, and one of the murderers who forced Du Chuqing to kill herself. Because these problems have not been answered correctly, the theme of this play is also blurred.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Ouyang Shafei, Xu Li, and Zhang Wan are all quite competent. 　Yan 　is superficial and excessive. Tu Guangqi's directing is like keeping a running account—he understands best how to cater to the tastes of petty bourgeois audiences.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb Secret</p>
<p>This scientific documentary depicts the research, manufacture, testing, and dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. It also brought about the victory of World War II. But today, this film is somewhat demonstrative. High scientific achievements must serve human happiness, otherwise, what is exchanged is bound to be destruction and devastation.</p>
<p>The director handles the film with rigor, and the actors' acting skills are all above par. The whole film is very smooth.</p>
<p>She's a Great Gal</p>
<p>A comedy starring Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power, depicting the story of a female swindler. There are many plot points in the play that do not fit the current situation, and the script is also mediocre. Although the performance is lighthearted, it is not in the style of a superior comedy, but rather an exaggerated technique to cater to the public.</p>
<p>Gene Tierney's performance is better than Tyrone Power's. It is another comedy film, depicting a beggar who becomes a noblewoman, but in the end, the author sends the heroine Kitty into the arms of a prodigal duke.</p>
<p>The scene where the old duke dies after rejoicing at the birth of his son is well done. 　　Paulette Goddard's Kitty is quite good, while Ray Milland's performance is lacking.</p>
<p>The Fighting Seabees</p>
<p>A war film produced by Republic Pictures, narrating the great feats of the engineering team of the United States Marine Corps in the war of resistance against Japan during this Great War. Although the whole film has many tense scenes, it appears scattered and loose due to the director's poor handling.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Susan Hayward's female reporter has mediocre acting skills, and John Wayne is only competent. However, Dennis O'Keefe's performance is relatively satisfactory.</p>
