<h3>參加選舉各團體　應先行造報名冊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕邇來各地人民團體之組織，進行甚速，或以此與職業選舉有蘭。本報記者十六日特走訪社會部長谷正綱，叩詢關於職業團體參加選舉，其成立期限是否有所規定？據答稱：指導人民團體組織，係本部經常業務，凡依法申請發起組織團體，均可隨時許可其設立。至職業團體與婦女團體參加選舉，依國大代表選罷法施行條例第九條第三項及立委選罷法施行條例第九條第三項之規定，應於選舉九十日前造報名册，故凡在本年大選九十日前依法成立之團體，均應造册呈報，享有選權，在此限期以後者，即不能參加選舉，但不影響其團體組織之進行。</p>
<h3>貝文發表演說　注視遠東情勢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：貝文今日向英運輸工人發表演說，據稱：遠東距離英國雖極遙遠，但其目前對英之潛伏危機，並不較歐洲爲小，深盼英人勿忽視遠東。貝文又稱：「有人指余將歐洲劃分爲二，並謂英國接受馬歇爾計劃，不啻造成第二慕尼黑，此種說法均屬不確。在過去兩年中，余不斷努力，企圖阻止歐洲之分裂。美國對於勝利，貢獻極大，余認爲美國應藉其龐大之生產能力，爲和平而努力。英國接受馬歇爾計劃，決不致因此成爲美之附庸」。最後，貝文以極沉重之音調，着重每二字句稱：「全世界已飽嘗戰爭之痛苦，無論我人·美國·法國或蘇聯決不需要另一次戰爭。但我人必須謹愼從事，否則不堪設想。余決不認定某某國爲可能之敵人，而根據此種假想實施政策，余所重視者，非原子炸彈，而實爲歐洲及全世界之永久和平」。。</p>

<p>美作家之傳說非事實</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕最近若干美國作家，曾謂華南雖無共匪，但中國政府對於修復該區之鐵路，尚未有何動作，此說絕非事實。茲據新聞局長董顯光發表，自交部獲悉有關修復華南鐵路之情形如下：抗戰期間，華南各鐵路綫因隨軍事態勢之轉變，破壞最爲澈底，現華南原有三·五〇七公里之鐵路，修復通車者，已達二·二二七公里，約三分之二。</p>
<h3>改建國大會堂　需費二百餘億　行政院正慎重考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國民大會堂之改建工程，總政院會同內政部營建司與馥記營造公司佔計，就改建工程與新建工程兩者分別估報，約如下列：（一）改建部份將原會堂拆除後部，增加席次，約需造價國幣二一四億九千一百十二萬元，需工作時爲一百五十天，（二）新建部份依照內政部營建司之草圓，約估計需造價國幣二百廿三億五千五百三十八萬七千五百元（如一部份鍋爐緩做及坐椅改用紗番布，可减國幣六十九億六千萬元），約需工作時一百八十天。又據聞：其中尚須另加繪圖時間三個月，以上計畫均係牽就現有會堂予以改建，據經管工程之人士稱：如就現有會堂向後面水塘延建，則前後　地堅鬆懸殊，全部結構無法平衡，然部有塌坍之處，且擴建後所添席次仍較所需差二百餘座，且後排坐位離主席台過遠，此點應加注意，以上工程及經費問題，均經政院愼重考慮中。</p>
<h3>朝鮮問題如獲解決　中國局勢自可澄清　權威人士談魏德邁使命</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕某權成人士談稱，魏德邁將軍來遠東考察，韓國亦爲某二大對象之一，或有若干觀念不正確者，以爲美方將主要勝利國之我國與現方置諸盟軍管制下之韓國相提並論，殊有不妥，實則韓國之現狀，遠較我國惡劣，二十月來，韓國爲美蘇政策之直接爭點，隨時可有銳尖牴觸事件發生，故美國極爲重視，且就我國觀點言之，如韓國問題可獲得出路，中國問題自可迎刃而解。國際關係，間題重在勢態事實，固不應以國家民族之地位而忽視之也。</p>
<p>朝鮮今日局勢　韓人至表悲憤</p>
<p>〔又電〕本報記者十七日走訪韓國臨時政府駐華代表團團長濮純，承告該團正以韓國最近情况之資料撰擬一備忘錄，以備提交魏德邁將軍。渠稱：日本投降將近兩年，而韓國之情形則每况愈下，北部韓共在蘇軍卵翼下，勢力日益膨脹，財富殘毀，民不聊生。南部則物價高漲，難民日增，且財閥與買辦出身之官僚勾結，再加韓共潛入活動，政治旣乏治績，社會更欠穩定，韓國人民對彼等犧牲於美·蘇衝突間之無辜厄運，至表悲憤。渠强調如美·蘇之間未獲得澈底和平談判，聯合政府之成立，將使韓南淪爲韓北第二，三十萬之武裝韓共，將囊括朝鮮半島，危及整個遠東和平。此爲韓國革命民主人士之一致觀點，至盼魏德邁將軍一行重視韓人之痛苦，使美國遠東政策有所變更。</p>
<h3>魏使來華任務　純為援助政府</h3>
<p>華盛頓人士談稱</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十六日電〕據消息靈通人士談稱，魏德邁將軍雖與去年馬歇爾元帥爲杜魯門總統特使相同，但其任務與馬帥完全不同。馬帥之使命，乃在設法調解該國國內之衝突，而魏德邁將軍之目的，乃在以美國所有一切可能之援助　予中國政府，以反對共產黨。美國援華之方式，殆將以軍械彈藥供給中國，進出口銀行已撥留而未放出之五萬萬美元貸款，亦有貸與中國之可能。貨款條件殆與貸款與希臘者相同，良以中希兩國國內之局勢，頗相類似故也。至於魏德邁將軍之前往朝鮮，亦負有重大任務，以決定美國應賡續與蘇聯政府在漢城進行談判，抑或美國單獨行動在美軍佔領區內組織臨時政府云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕世界電訊報十七日影評魏德邁之赴華稱：「目前中國之局勢大半由美國所造成者，因羅斯福之信任中共與蘇聯政策，遂致今日大半滿洲與朝鮮落入中共與蘇聯之手。魏德邁之赴華爲我人對華採取建設性政策，以替代猶豫政策之前提」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛噸十六日電〕魏德邁將軍偕顧問五人，今晨搭乘陸軍飛機赴南京。赴機場送別者，有國務院官員與若干中國官員，其中有顧維鈞，唐紹華及黃仁霖等。</p>

<h3>對日和約應行討論各事　我方有充分準備　中法對美建議即可接受</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕外部發言人張沅長十七日語記者：關於對日和約應行討論之各事項，我方均有充分準備，可隨時提出資料，以供十一國蘇府會議參考。至具體主張，如對賠償配額，明確決定日本現政體之是否仍須改造，琉球，韓國地位之商按與再商　諸端，政府正　愼考慮，如有確定，或將發表公告。張氏認美方　議於八月十九日舉行之　府會議，旣係和會預備會，偏　和約技術問題，和約內容各點，恐將作一廣泛討論，不致因欲有所決定而引起多大苦難。張氏對記者提出之「若蘇聯拒絕參加該會，我將採取何種態度？」一問題婉拒答覆，然就渠另稱我出席該會之代表團，可能自現留駐美國之外交官中予指定一語，及其他談話推測，我國當已於原則上決定接受美國邀請。</p>
<p>〔又電〕某外交人士表示，如非國內山東及東北局勢之惡化，與中蘇之間問題產生，對日和約談判之邀請，實應由我國首先發起，此久懸之遠東課題之解決，政府實與與論同等焦灼，今旣由美方發起邀請，我方應提出精密之意見，以助和會量得成就，奠立遠東安定　石。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕外交部今是表示，對於美國建議八月十九日在華府召集十一國會議討論對日和約一節，未便發表意見，尚待詳細研究。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕美國今日提議於八月十九日在華盛頓或舊金山召開十一國對日和約預備會議，中法兩國即可接受。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕美國國務院業已接受不列顚共和邦釋明於八月十九日召開十一國對日和約會議之日期殊不方便之解釋，預料美國可望同意，將和約討論日期延至九月份中。不列顚共和邦原已定於八月二十六日在康白拉召開共和邦會議討論對日和約問題，故與美國建議之於八月十九日召開十一國會議，時間上將有衝突，英國，澳大利及紐西蘭，已將前意非正式知照美國國務院，印度亦將繼之採取同一步驟。</p>
<p>〔路透社孟哲斯特十七日電〕孟哲斯特導報評美國邀遠東委員會之十一國討論日本和約之事稱：美國相信在目前形勢下，舉行外長會議，不便難望成功，且將增加對蘇之爭執，故已決定廢棄經由外長會議之原則，以處理日本和約問題，此乃新頴之行動，然尚待蘇聯之同意，想馬歇爾國務卿亦決不願不待蘇聯之參加而完成對日和約也。</p>
<h3>美决不顧蘇反對　縱使蘇不參加亦按計劃進行　預備會議召開日期或將展延</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕美官員十七日承認：蘇聯拒絕放棄否決權，由十一國而非四國，起草對日和約，將使馬歇爾之決定，以生困難。大部份外交家揣測，馬歇爾建議於八月十九日召開對日和會初步會議時，業已準備　「預料之危險」。渠等感覺，馬歇爾深知，蘇聯定將再度拒絕遠東方面之計劃正與其在歐洲會議中拒絕馬歇爾計劃之情形相同。此等外交家相信，必要時馬歇爾，將不待蘇聯參加而進行對日和約之起草。渠在國內可獲得熱烈擁護，特別在國會方面，以及其他被邀請參加和會。各國之擁護。此兩方面人士皆認為蘇聯參加對日作戰太遲，係最後始行加入者。就美國對蘇堅決之政策言之，此間咸認如蘇聯阻撓，馬歇爾決不致取消其對日條約之計劃。渠之對蘇基本政策，乃為對任何部分之外交政策，一旦決定後，決不退讓。但如蘇聯拒絕遠東委員會十一個國家在華盛頓開始起草對日和約計劃，則縱使蘇聯不參加，亦決定進行。由此項後果而採取之主要原則，如能對日聯分開。然此一步驟，此間無人願採取，但美蘇兩國皆在聯合國宣言中信誓旦旦，謂決不單獨締結和約。如美國破壞該項信誓，某某方面將加以堅强之壓力，但如屬必要，恐更大之壓力，將加諸另一方面之破壞信誓者。另一方面亦必爭持，謂戰時信誓，破壞多於遵守。美國官方準備召開對日和約預備會議之日期延遲一個月。</p>

<p>盟軍總部官員稱：麥帥諒亦不立即發表批評，日入消息，相信美國倡議加速進行和會，對於鼓勵日本早日獨立之希望，有極大影響。日本觀察家認為美國動議，與世界混亂局勢有關，特別與美國對蘇聯集團間分裂加深有關。渠等稱：美國最近加速進行對日條約之動議，必然對日本傾向美國之情感及對美國結成陣綫反對共黨集團，有一重大影響。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京十七日電〕東京股票交易所聞對日和約初步討論會議，定期召開之訊，各股均漲起二至七點，尤以紡織業股為甚。片山首相評此一消息，表示極度愉快，並曰此一會議可使各盟國得於制定日本和約前熱悉日本今日之情形。蘆田外相表示進行對日和約之每一行動，將受極度歡迎。</p>

<h3>我國應早準備對日和約</h3>
<p>美國為提早締結對日和約起見，已向遠東委會十一會員國建議，於八月十九日召開對日和約初步會議；中，法，菲，印度曁荷蘭，殆將表示同意；英國及其自治領，因已定於八月廿六日舉行帝國會議，對於日本和約問題交換意見，故主張對日和約初步會議應改期舉行；現在所成問題的，只有蘇聯一國，聞美國駐蘇大使史密斯將軍訪晤莫洛托夫外長時，蘇聯外長曾立即表示異議，並認為對日和約應由外長會議起草，無庸其他小國參加；惟據美國國務卿馬歇爾向記者表示，渠不信蘇聯會拒不參加對日和約初步會議；截至目前為止蘇聯的態度尚未作最後的決定。據華府消息靈通人士談稱，美國這次發起對日和約初步會議，乃欲在遠東委員會範圍之外，另行召開遠東十一國會議，以起草對日和約，藉此避免蘇聯對於任何建議行使否決權；俾使對日和約的起草工作，得以順利進行；所以蘇聯是否接受邀請參加議會，確是一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>至於我國對於日本和約問題，早已有明顯的立塲表示；我國對於日本，雖不欲採取報復主義，以過分苛刻的條件，向日本提出；但是我國對日作戰最久，遭遇日本的侵略最慘，故所蒙受的損失也最重，自七七事變發生以至抗戰勝利結束，我國公私物資所受的損失，總計不下三百萬萬美元，八年來國家軍費的支出，尚不計算在內；軍民的死傷，更在千萬人以上，這種浩大的損失，幾乎無法統計。而今我國在創鉅痛深之餘，從事於戰後復興工作，不論在物質上經濟上，無一不需要外來的援助，尤其迫切需要日本的賠償。自日本屈膝投降以還，不久即將滿整整的兩年頭了，我們只看到聽到日本復興的情形，但是召開對日和會的日期，因對德對奧和約未能起草成功，一再遷延，以致遙遙無期，當非我國所願意的。但自莫斯科四國外長會議不歡而散之　，馬歇爾國務卿返國，即開始考慮起草對日和約的方式；東京盟軍最高統帥麥克阿　元帥，亦一再呼　，要求盟國加速進行對日締結和約的工作；美國前任總統胡佛，於上月初，竟發表驚人言論，主張美國將蘇聯摒棄在外，單獨與德日兩國締結和約；國務院雖不十分重視胡佛的主張，但是與論界却感到極大的興趣。美國人民之渴望對日和約早日　，自為美國人民以及遠東有關各國人民所歡迎。</p>
<p>對日和約的起草工作，有關遠東和平的百年大計，我們在對日和約初步會議開幕之前，不得不提出幾點意見，一則可供大家的參考，另則以喚起國人的注意。</p>
<p>第一，我國不僅在戰時對於打敗日本帝國主義的貢獻最大，而且在戰後對於維持遠東和平所負的責任也最重，所以在對日和會中，中國應處於特別重要的地位，其所發表的意見，應受其他各國的特別重視。在我國本身，更應該早日準備，俾至開會時能有積極性之建議。誠如孫副主席於六月廿五日所說：「中國應準備早日與日本簽訂和約，以保證日本永不再成為侵略國，而協力促進東方永久和平」。國府委員王寵惠氏亦於七月九日談稱：「行政院正在草擬對日和約，其內容以解除武裝，賠償通商，以及移民政策為主題」，日本在戰前，除武力而甚稔，我國應早擬就具體辦法，提出於對日和約初步會議討論。</p>
<p>第二，麥帥管制日本，雖有不可否認的成就；但是「君子可欺以其方」，麥帥受日人的一味對好與逢迎，當不免失之太寬，而過分信任日人。例如前外相吉田茂曾於五月十日，將「日本對於和約的觀點及其願望」，正式通知麥帥；據法國新聞社的報導此一秘密文件的要點有三：（一）日本希望能與美國共同託管琉球羣島；（二）日本希望在台灣能取得特別移民權；（三）日本希望在南庫頁島及千島列島附近海面取得捕魚權。最近日本又有一位九十歲的老議員尾崎行雄，提出一項未來和約的重案，其要點亦有兩項：（一）「滿洲」，台灣，以及琉球，應在聯合國機構監察之下，舉行公民投票，以決定其是否獨立　載應屬於何國；（二）日本賠償問題，應根據雙方所受之損失，賠款應付與損失最大的一方；戰勝國如不顧此項意見，則日本應以不合作而反對其要求。由此可知，日本的侵略野心，不僅未死，而且又蠢蠢欲動了。對日和約初步會議，對於日人狂妄的非理要求，自無考慮的餘地。</p>
<p>第二，遠東委員會於六月十九日，已決定其對日基本政策，其最終目標，乃在保證日本不再成為世界和平　繁榮之威脅；盟國若欲達成此一目的，我們認為在對日和約中，必須有具體辦法的規定。我們認為防制日本再起侵略的最佳辦法，　為由遠東有關各國，　　五强或四强公約，不容日本再有侵略的幻想。</p>
<p>要之，對日和約的起草工作，有關遠東和增的百年大計，我國應該早早準備，俾至對日和約初步會議開幕時，能提出有效而合理的方案，作為各國討論的基礎。我們希望各國均能正視遠東的現實，並能了解我國的立塲，對於我國所提出的意見，應特別予以重視。</p>
<h3>上海巿兵役問題</h3>
<p>自從國務會議通過「厲行全國總動員」案，行政院制定動員實施綱要後，上海巿的兵投問題，已進入積極化階段。為動員各界協助兵役，上海巿兵役協會，業已正式成立，今天下午且將召開會議，推動工作。為商討兵役行政之推進，巿政府民政處及師管區司令部更連日召開座談茶會，中樞兵役局徐局長思平，並特地來滬出席報告。據悉，上海巿對兵役實施程序，主管協管方面，均已準備就緒，八月一日即可開始辦理。關於兵役之推行，在上海是一件創舉，未來的良　成敗，關係甚大，値得重視。</p>
<p>兵役，本為獨立國家的要政。獨立國家應有其國防，故必有兵役為捍衛國家的潛力。任何獨立國家的憲法，都規定人民有服兵役的義務，我國主＼憲法亦列有專條。兵役法是推行兵役事務，規定人民服役的實體法，它規定凡為中華民國男子，人人有服兵役之義務，同時人人有享兵役之權利。兵役事務，是不分平時戰時的；各國的情形都是如此。平時必須為戰時準備，戰時必須動員平時力量，以捍衛國家，保障疆土，維護民族的生存獨立。兵役實在是國家民族持續的生命力，繼百世而不朽不廢的要政。</p>
<p>我國抗戰八年，前綫將士前仆後繼，補充不感匱乏，最後取得勝利，實有賴於兵役。勝利以後，共匪叛亂，保障國土安全，兵役動員自更刻不容緩，唯有上海巿延緩迄今，確是件　事。最近巿政當局，對於推行兵役已具決心，並與中樞商定，上海配賦兵額為三千名，以志願兵為主，徵兵為輔。同時為求辦理兵役辦理的公正公平，動員了民意機關及各界代表，紀　兵役協會，以協助其事。不過，上海社會現象很複雜，一般人對兵役的認識又不够，這次兵役的創辦，必須有許多的繁難。所以我們願黃　下列意見，希望巿當局及社會人士，努力赴之！</p>
<p>一，志願兵實施問題。我國兵役法立法精神，是實施徵兵制，這是幾千年來立國的兵制，也是現代化的新兵制。志願兵制係輔助性質，如何「志願」，如何「服役」，兵役法第卅二條僅作彈性規定。但志願兵制乃素質較高的兵制，現在我國的青年軍，就是依志願而服役的。上海巿有人口四百萬，民國十二年至十六年出生的適齡壯丁，據調查約四十六萬，配徵三千人，僅占適齡壯丁十五分之一，依法實行徵兵，本不應有問題。現在當局以實施志願兵為主，徵兵為輔，大約為了减少社會的給亂與不安。不過在這裏要指出：志願兵並不不是募兵，辦理的方式，不能出以傭兵的手段。果眞要實施志願兵，則必須從速號召知識青年從軍，鼓舞優秀青年為國效命。這樣，纔能維持志願兵的素質，及過去青年軍踴躍從戎的榮譽。實施志願兵的同時，更不可放棄徵兵，二者應併行不悖的。</p>
<p>二，優待征屬問題。　兵役法規定服役者應享權利甚多，如應徵召時，學生准保留學籍；職工准保留底缺，退伍復員後得優先就業；擔任作戰勤務中，政府應負責維持其家庭生活等等。從服役者本身看，這是他應享的權利；從政府及社會角度看這是對服役者的一種優待。上海巿人口眾多，不乏熱心好義之士，籌募優待經費，徵集慰勞物質，自較其他地方優越。因此，希望兵役協會迅速發動民力，對於應徵服役人民，規定各項優待征屬爆發，以减少征人後顧之憂，為全國樹立楷模，而移轉社會不良的風氣。</p>
<p>三，免緩奧召審查問題。　兵役是動員業務一部門，但在適齡男子中，無論平戰時，均有「不可動員」的人員，担任其他部門的業務。兵役法的免役及緩徵緩召，則專為此而設。除法律規定緩　召條款外，主管官署並不千里馬行政命令，隨時為權宜之處置。上海辦理兵役係創舉，而依法合於免緩徵召條件者，預料為數當甚多。我們希望巿當局及兵役協會，規定凡依法合於免緩徵召者，一律繳納經費，以為籌措壯丁安家費之來源。但，不合於免緩徵召條件者，從願捐助優待經費，亦不能予以兵役之免緩以杜「納金緩役」之弊。能如是，則上海三千征人，以及三千戶征屬之生活救濟，自然不感匱乏。</p>
<p>總之，兵役是國家的要政，上海是不能逃避的，上海巿民更其不願逃避的。今天的國家，已進入非常時期，人人必須動員為國效命，以爭取民族的生存。上海辦理兵役，各種條件優越，熱心好義之士眾多，雖然是第一次徵兵，祗要合法合理去辦，並不喚起優秀青年自覺自動的投効，自必能樹立良好的規模，以收風行草　之效的。</p>

<h3>實施馬歇爾援歐計劃　法擬就具體建議　提高經濟合作委會討論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十六日電〕歐洲經濟合作委員會，本日開始起草關於歐洲資源及其所需要之報吿嘗。法爾提議向各會員國提出八組問題，請其加以答覆。法國之建議將由歐洲經濟合作委會，明晨會議時予以討論。此八組問題之目的，乃在便和合作委會報吿書之起草工作，此項報吿書將作爲美國經濟援歐範圍之　礎。</p>
<p>依照法國四年復興計劃委員會所擬定之計劃，八組問題將決定下列三點：（一）歐洲各國爲克服戰爭所造成之困難，究已作何種之努力。（二）在歐洲各國之間，究已有何種互助興互相支。（三）各國爲欲確保歐洲經濟復興，最低限度需要多少外來之援助，僅就歐洲復興所必要之生產品而言，會員國家之國外屬地憂亦將列入決算單之內，增加此等生產品之產社方法，亦將列入歐洲復興計劃之中。</p>
<p>法國所提議之問題共分八紐，要點如次：（一）研究戰爭所引起之困難，按此一問顧業由聯合國歐洲經濟委會加以審議。（二）分析各國對於復興其本國經濟所作之努力。（三）分析各國對於其他國家之復興所作之貢獻。（四）研究歐洲各國在一九四七年至一九五〇年四年內所擬作之努力。（五）糧食及原料之供求平衡。（六）各種設條及工業產品進出口之平衡。（七）決定各國在一九四七年至一九五〇年內付款平衡之要素。（八）每一國家除作上述之努力而外，並應在貸款及人力方面，對於其他國家有所買獻。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十六日電〕法國發言人頃談稱；上述八項問題，將於明晨十時三十分提交合作委員會討論，即行決定其爲進行歐洲復興計劃之主要經濟因素。另悉，五國執行委員會今夜在法外部開會，討論調整委員會與糧食，鋼鐵，水電力，運輸四個小組委會之工作時間表。瑞典及丹麥代表認爲法國建議過長，而荷蘭代表則認對於復興計劃之佔計若超過三年以上，即有困難。</p>
<h3>英美兩國對德政策　法政府表示關注　英盼華府談判擴大範圍</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕可靠方面息：法外長皮杜爾吿法國內閣稱，渠與英貝文外相作私人談話時，已表示法國政府因美政府昨日向德境美軍區長官兼盟管會美代表克萊將軍所頒指令，將使美國對德政策有所變更一點，深爲關切。此外，法國對於英美就德國工業之談判亦甚關注，深恐此項談判將越出「工業水準」之範圍以外，而涉及魯爾區之組織及政治行政問題。法國認爲此事將對法國之政洽經濟生活，有重大之影響，故要朮參與意見。聞貝文外相業已向皮杜爾保證，決將英美在華盛頓會談之經過，隨時知照法國。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英美在華盛頓舉行之魯爾煤斤問題談判，確期沿未決定，僅知英方首席代表將爲英駐德政治顧問史屈朗氏及德境英軍區副長官羅勃森中將。據柏林方面揣測，談判結果可望成立協定，以設立魯爾煤產之新管制機構，並在英美共同監督之下，將魯爾煤礦移交德人管理。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕權威方面息：英國鑒於德境英美合併區之糧食及經濟狀况，使英國增加美匯支出之負担，故已向美國建議擴大英美即將在美京舉行關於魯爾區煤產問題談話之範圍，使其包括德境英美合併區之一般經濟及糧食問題，該項談話定於下星期內在此舉行。查英國對於英美合併區之費用應負担其半，對於缺乏美匯之英國，實爲一重大之員担，且去年十二月在華盛頓決定之英美合併區預算，目前亦已覺不敷，故英國頗思乘下週談判之機機予以檢討。</p>
<p>美國重視魯南煤產</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日在此表示，美國返盼增加魯爾區之煤斤產量，同時柏林之英當局則宣布，英美所成立提高德國銅鐵產置樣準之協定，決定無定期展期宣布。馬鄕今日在記者招待會中，指出魯爾煤產之增加，爲歐洲復興計劃之基礎，渠認魯爾爲歐洲復興所需之原料中心，對之極爲重視。但復表示不擬於日前有所舉動，使人懷疑馬歇爾援歐計劃之主動應由歐洲掌握之事實。</p>
<p>對德政策並無變更</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕美商務部長哈立曼今日在此談稱，美國對德政策並未因昨日美政府對德境美軍區畏官克萊將軍所頒之指令而有所變更。哈氏於指出德境英美區工業平均生產量，僅及一九三六年產量之百分之卅八，而歐洲其餘部份工業平均產量已及一九三六年產量之百分之九十後，聲明美國無意使德國在歐洲之經濟復興中，佔有優先地位。美國旣未給予亦不擬給予此種優先地位，但擬使德國在歐洲之經濟復興中，擔任其應盡之義務。對克萊將軍指令之於此時發表，絕對未具特別作用。哈氏並曰，美國頗受巴黎會議所獲成就之鼓勵，現正靜待其結果</p>
<h3>華萊士擁護　馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>稱蘇聯將自鍳在歐聲譽</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十六日電〕華萊士頃在本期「新共和雜誌」發表一文，主張聯合國應速即推行非政治性質之外國緊急救濟計劃，並力言蘇聯外長莫洛托夫退出巴黎經濟會議，將喪失蘇聯在歐洲之聲譽，殆無疑義。略謂：根據馬歇爾之經濟援歐計劃，至少沿須一年，始有供應物資可以運抵歐洲，故須立即應付歐洲之需要；此爲極重要之事，聯合國今惟有推行緊急救濟計劃，始可增强其地位，此外尙需開闢一途經，以全面推行馬歇爾所原定之合作計劃。關於與德國單獨媾和，在聯合國以外團結西方國家一議，渠表示反對。並謂，倘美國强行其原十管制計劃，迫使聯合國大會加以接受或拒絕，則吾人將遭遇改組聯合國之危運。至少將見其在聯合閱機構以外，另證一防務系統云。</p>
<h3>義外長建議　法義經濟同盟</h3>

<h3>波蘭代表向安理會建議　外軍應退出希臘　埃對英控案決改期辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：波蘭今日要求安理會組織希臘聯合政府，並以聯合國行動逐出駐於希臘之外國眾隊及「軍事顧問」。此間認爲波蘭此項建議，其目的乃在阻緩聯合國邊境調查團在希，阿，保邊境之工作。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：安全理事會今日開會，其重要發展如次：（一）波蘭代表請求安理會設法中止希臘與阿爾巴尼亞七年來之戰爭狀態；（二）英代表對埃及要求中止英方在尼羅河之佔領一點，表示並不反對。但因巴爾幹問題較爲重要，故應將英埃問題延至八月五日討論，結果通過。</p>
<h3>美立場堅決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國機構方面今日宣稱：蘇聯倘行使否決權，阻止安理會設立半永久性巴爾幹調查團，美國或將提議在聯合國機構之外，設立調查團，監視希臘邊境局勢。此事可由希臘邀請聯合國其他各會員爾，組織獨立調查團，設立總部於希臘境內，監視巴爾幹游擊隊動態。此種調查團雖無權力，但可蒐集情報，於聯合國大會九月間開會時，經由各本國政府提出。但美英兩國似將竭力轉實，採取其他方法，最後始出於此舉。據消息靈通人士稱，蘇聯此刻倘利用否決權以妨碍此事，則安理會中可能根據憲章第七章關於威脅和平與破壞和平一款，提出新控訴，屆時安理會可討論採取武力以外之措施，如經濟制裁與斷絕外交關係之類，以對付被控國家。</p>
<h3>增強土運輸系統　美商船十艘售土</h3>
<p>鬥路透社華盛頓十六日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日透露：渠已請求美國海務委員會批准以美國商船十艘，根據最近經國會批准之援土計劃售與土耳其。馬卿請，就渠所知，此乃根據援土計劃首批移讓土國之物資，此項船舶將售與土國交通部之採購代表團，由土政府支付價額。出售之目的，在使土國得以新船替換舊船，以增强其運輸制度。</p>
<h3>杜魯門不願參加三巨頭直接商談</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕據十七日獲悉：杜魯門總統表示除非蘇聯史達林元帥及英首相艾德禮兩人赴美與之會商，否則仍堅決反對舉行另一次三巨頭會議。此一消息，透露於命運多舛之波茨坦會議之二週年紀念日。該一次三巨頭會議，爲杜魯門首次同時或許爲最後一次之參加高級秘密國際會議。杜魯門及其顧問認爲一國元首在平時參加秘密談判，實不足爲訓，並與美國制度不合。渠等並坦白責備故羅斯福總統之秘密協定，應負目前世界甚多糾紛之責。波茨坦協定中甚少條款業已履行，因大國未能找出可接受之方法，將其實施，尤以關於德國之條款爲然。經過兩年無結果之爭論與談判，雖則每一大國皆號稱仍抱持渠等之總目標，然波茨坦協定不問在實施上，抑在形式上，業已成爲廢紙。美官員承認，美蘇兩國現已從事全面之外交及經濟戰爭，蘇美關係業已以可駕速率日趨惡劣，在最近之將來，更將急轉直下。</p>
<h3>游擊隊遭迎頭痛擊　希臘戰事轉沉寂　英軍官以顧問資格協助戡亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕萬金山十七日廣播：希臘戰專今日起已吿沉寂，由阿爾巴尼亞進攻希臘之海擊隊，　政府軍迎頭痛　後，已退至邊境山區。今日僅有僅星衝突。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英外交部發言人鄭重否認任何形式之英軍，曾積極參加希臘對遊擊隊之戰。詢以英軍官是否曾以顧問資格，協助進攻遊擊隊之希臘政府軍。答曰，英軍在希之任務，即協助維持秩序，固已盡人皆知云。按希遊擊隊司令馬柯斯曾謂俘獲英軍官及軍士，英外部遂作前項聲明以答覆之。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕蒂拉那電台報吿阿爾巴尼亞電訊社之報吿，否認阿爾巴尼亞之遊擊部隊在希臘北部柯尼柴一帶作戰，以及「國際旅團」已自阿國侵入希臘之說。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十六日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯，十六日在聯合國原子能委會之政治委會秘密會議中，提議簽訂世界原子協定，以統制各國鈾　與計礦之開採及支配。並謂接受此項建議後，全世界之原子管制可能有決定性之進展。在蘇聯之建議中，其範圍所及，或將包括所有原子能設備及原子能原素，並將詳列各國可以使用原子能設備及原素之方法及限額。葛羅米柯主張另組特別委員會以研究此項限額，而使原子能委會無權過間此事。葛氏並主張限額應每次加以調整，此項協定亦可加以修正。各國代表對蘇聯此次之突然建議，均不願發表意見。按此項建議爲蘇聯之第三次建議，葛羅米柯前曾提議締結一項立即毀滅原子彈之協定，穢復提議組織國際管制機構，以調查及統制原子能。美國主張國際原子能機構應有權處理世界上已經開採之所有鈾　，但遭葛氏之反對。</p>
<h3>蘇聯御用的日本共產黨</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>蘇聯利用日本共產黨來對抗美國佔領當局的策路，在今年一月間造成了美國佔領日本以來最危急的局面。在共黨支配下的工會醞釀着一次總罷工，目的在破壞日本經濟體系。當時罷工領袖們曾接到佔領單當局不准罷工的通知。據熟悉共黨內幕的日本人說，指揮罷工的共產黨委員會爲了取得蘇聯的支持，曾經和蘇聯的駐日人員發生接觸。</p>
<p>據某工會報吿：蘇聯當局會對日本共產黨說：「你們應該記着十六項原則。」（按：遠東委員會會於一九四六年十二月十八日宣佈對日原則十六條，其中一條准許爲「政治行動」而罷工。）蘇聯某副官吿訴日本共產黨，對於不准罷工的佔領軍命令儘司置之不理。同時共產黨中央委員會發出　一條命令，大言不慚說：「關於我們的罷工，已經取得盟軍管制委員會蘇聯代表的諒解。因此，對於佔領當局命令發生恐懼，是大可不必的。」　日本共產黨員雖號稱有五萬人，但阻敢藐視日本佔領軍的共產黨員祗有二萬五千人。可是他們的勢力勢圍遠過於他們的實際數字。他們辦報紙和許多日文雜誌，組織文化社團和人民陣綫，劍辦一種靑年團體和一所大學。共產黨時常利用一般無知愚民。發動示威運動，手裏握着紅旗，高喊他們所不懂的口號，終於遭到佔領當局的禁止。</p>
<p>日本共產黨現正竭力煽動素且保守性的農民。最近發生的阻止米糧運往城市的騷動，在幕穢策動的人便是他們。當上次大選時，他們並不注意於議會選舉，反而傾注全力於地方選舉。有幾個無黨無派的候選人，後來却變成了共產黨員。他們更設法使共產黨員混入學校中，以抵補被肅淸的十二萬日本教師。</p>
<p>但是共產黨擴張勢力的主要方法由共產黨混入各業工會而操縱之。在工會運動尙屬幼稚的日末，共產黨還可用其他方法操縱工會，譬如他們時常能够籠絡初出茅蘆的工會領袖。他們又能向新工會薦舉各項技術人員如簿記員，打字員等，而漸漸升任秘書等機要職位。　日本是重要的工會組織—日本工業組織大會，是受着共產黨的控制的。隸屬該大會的許多工會都由共黨把握實權。共產黨的兩大壁壘，一是國有鐵路工會，擁有工人五十四萬人，一是交通部職工會，擁有工人三十八萬人。共產黨在日本，像在其他各國一樣，使用全力以控制可使令國經濟頓時崩潰的各項重要工業。</p>
<p>今年一月間，日本共產黨憑其已經獲得的工會勢力，來過一次驚人的示威。他們照例提出一種合決的要求，以物價高漲爲理由，要求增加工資。於是共產黨就組織「全國政府職工及公務員聯合鬥爭委員曾」，不久又擴大爲「全國工會聯合鬥爭委員會」，委員四十六人中共產黨佔三分之一，即此少欺已足控制委員會而有餘。同時，該委員會的三位領袖和高級幹部又受共產黨的支配。</p>
<p>「聯合鬥爭委員會」的目的是執行共產黨的政策，發動該委員會所代表的二百萬工人同盟大罷工。一部分的目的是要推翻保守的吉田內閣，因此，美員會故意提出極高的要求，使政府難以接受。因此，這種罷工顯然是政治性的這是日本共產黨首領之一志賀所承認的。共產黨隨時可以援引華府遠東委員會所宣佈的十六項原則。</p>
<p>可是日本共產黨的主要目的是造成日本的混亂局而，藉以破壞美國的佔領工作。罷工的後果，除了工業陷入伴頓狀態外，將立刻發生飢餓和社會不安。這是佔領當局和共產黨積怨日深的結果。共產黨起初認爲美國人待他們很好，因爲美國人非但把他們從監獄裏釋放出來，而且佔領軍當局還很客氣地接見他們。可是，到了一九四六年秋間，共產黨發覺了他們的錯誤，便開始反對並企圖破壞美國的佔領任務。</p>
<p>共產黨總釀同盟罷工的企圖終吿失敗。麥帥毅然發出禁止罷工的命令，如違嚴懲不貸。當時蘇聯不能實踐其支持日本共產黨的諾言。從此日本輿論一致反對日本共產黨。但是日本共產黨却迫使麥帥違反他的本願而干涉日本內政。此外，美國的佔領工作仍受遠東委員會十六項原則命令，白宮獎勵工會運動的命令，和波茨坦宣言的拘束。在上述種種命令沒有改變以前，日本共產黨仍可以公然向美國佔領當局挑戰。（譯自Newsweek）</p>

<h3>錢塘號火車丹陽出軌　發覺尚早得未釀覆車慘禍　乘客分兩批運滬各車誤點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨八時，由京駛滬之第一次車錢塘號，（京杭直趨車）於十時十四分在甫通過丹陽站（不停靠）尚未出該站外揚旗時，列車之第三節FD六一三號頭等餐車後輪突然脫軌而出，幸此時行車速率甚低，且站上人手眾多，站長亦尚未離開，當目擊火車發出怪聲與劇烈震盪，知已發生事故，乃急遣站工兩名，持紅旗追上機車通知，立即煞車，倖免翻覆，旅客均安全無恙。客車亦無損壞，僅鋼軌二節略有蜷曲，枕木二百餘根悉被震斷。常州站聞聲，急派救援車駛赴出事地點，工務段陳寶興段長親率技工百餘名前往搶修，更換枕不銅軌，經四十分鐘修復。該列車出事後，已將第三節餐車卸下，機車及第一第二節頭等車廂毫不受影響，乃於十時五十分先行開駛來滬，於四時廿三分抵滬，餐車後之客車六節臨時加添機車駛滬，於七時另一分到達本巿北站，第一二兩節頭等客車抵杭僅較平時誤點五十五分鐘。京滬綫第五·第七·第十五三次列車，均因此誤點二三小時不等，其餘各次車皆未受影響。</p>
<h3>丹陽站上　發生紛擾</h3>
<p>當時丹陽站被錢塘號旅客責難，曾一度引起紛擾，因此次失事未肇鉅禍，旅客深自慶幸，以時近中午，且站上告知修理必甚費時，故旅客紛紛下車入丹陽城內進餐，不料餐畢歸站，機車已先拖前兩節客車駛去，前兩節旅客中頗多將皮包·長衫·上衣等放置車中。後六節旅客則以機車不應單拖前二節先行，亦羣起責難，路局運務處允一面電沿綫各站站長，加意保護先行兩節車中無主行李雜物，一面另派機車將後六節客車拖駛來滬轉杭。</p>
<p>據悉此次出軌而未成鉅禍，因最近路局行車安全會議決定，自本月十一日起至二十二日為工作安全競賽週，各次列車開行速率普遍减低，昨日錢塘號出事時之速率為每小時三十三公里，（為最慢限度），若仍照平時速率（五十公里）則十步釀成覆車慘禍。至於出軌原因，經工務處會同研究，仍大惑不解，因該處旣無又軌，枕木鋼軌又均健全，且行車速率極緩慢，無一理由足以說明失事原因，丹陽站已將詳細情形，攝成照片報告管理局，再由專家研究。</p>

<h3>房租管理辦法　公會表示不公</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿房地產業同業公會秘書長陳停昆對於巿府前日會商決定之本巿房屋租賃管理辦法表示意見稱：該項辦法，就大體言之，對於業主租戶尚能兼籌並不顧，所　為遺憾者，即第一條酌加利潤下括弧內加註之「以上列各種實際支出總數百分之十為準」句，則顧欠公平。觀乎本辦法第四條房屋轉租部份規定「最高不得超過原租金一倍」句，則偏枯至為明顯。蓋二房東之原租金即其對於房屋之支出總數，換言之即大房東之利潤，袛能依其支出總數百分之十為準，而二房東之利潤，反可依其支出總數凈得百分之百。况業主於產業之投資，房屋之折舊，尚未計及。關於此點，似僅注意二房東分租之利益而對業主之權益，仍未免採取壓抑手段云。</p>

<h3>北太平洋綫客機　氣候影響昨未來　可能明日兩機同時到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美西北航空公司北太平洋航綫首次客機〔上海號〕，原定昨午可以抵滬，茲悉因氣候關係，該機昨尚滯留阿拉斯加，約於明日始能抵滬，而該公司第二班客機已於十七日自明尼波里斯開出，故明日兩機可能同時抵滬。本巿旅客向該公司辦事處登記者已有二十餘人，票價自滬至紐約美金八三四元一角五分，至東京一六二元，至西雅圖七〇〇元，至明尼波理斯七八〇元四角，至馬尼拉一九〇元。</p>
<h3>平糶每石酌增經費萬元　產業工人月配食油二斤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿民食調配委員會，於昨晨十時，在黃陂南路會所舉行第三次會議，由主任委員吳開先主席，首由調查·審核·分配各科負責人報告工作情形，繼即開始討論，重要議案如下：</p>
<p>貧戶平糶　即可發售</p>
<p>（一）貧戶平糶碎米以每石十六萬八千元計算，近奉糧食部令每石酌增一萬元作鑿糶經費之用。六月份平糶，待日內發出平糶證後即可發售。各區呈報辦理平糶經費預算，統一核定為，一，運費巿區每石四千元，郊區每石七千元；二，出倉費每石一千三百元；三，區公所每次辦理平糶辦公費每區一百萬元；四，經售米店手續費每石八百元；五，損耗每石以不超過二合為原則。平糶站（經售米店）因規定手續費每石祗八百元，故各區以每一平糶站經售五百石為原則，郊區並不得酌量增加。</p>
<p>私立醫院　停止配米</p>
<p>（二）通過產業工人配油實施辦法，每人二巿斤，每月一次，由民食調配委員會辦理。各工廠祗需開列配米原領之撥糧單字號戶號人數，即可請配，不必另造名册。該項配油實施辦法待中央銀行張總裁自華北返滬由中信局與調配會簽訂協定後，即可公佈。該會並接奉糧食部令，自即日起對私立醫院停止配米。</p>
<p>配售煤球　尚待決定</p>
<p>配售工人煤球事，昨日會中亦曾提及，一部份委員以為民食調配會祗辦理民食，不應負責配售煤球。吳開先則認為調配會已辦理工人配米及配油，似可駕輕就熟，且配售煤球即係供煮飯之用，似可仍由調配會負責。該事尚未作最後決定，惟原則上大致將歸民食調配會辦理。</p>
<h3>「全合」供銷處　增配日用品</h3>
<p>社會部全國合作社物品供銷處，為配合經濟緊急措施方案，擴大公敎人員實物配給，以期切實改進公敎員工生活起見，特於政府配給公敎員工六種生活必需品以外，籌劃增配日常生活用品如毛巾襪子襯衫汗衫等六種。先在京滬兩地試辦，俟有成效，再行推及其他省巿。關於資金一項，由四聯總處通過，分由中央合作金庫代表辦理手續。紗布原料則由中紡公司供給，現正加緊督製中，下月起，可能先行配售襯衫等數種物品。至配給辦法，該處已訂有詳細辦法，並將聘請中央合作金庫中紡公司等十一單位代表組織評議委員會，主持訂價分配等事宜，凡經京滬兩巿府配給柴米等六種實物之公敎員工，均可由該處每人每月或每季發給配購證　憑證向指定合作社價購云。</p>
<h3>宣司令再度闡明職權　斥被捕學生家長不智</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾氏，對被捕學生家屬向高等法院提審一事曾發表談話，闡釋本巿戒嚴之經過，昨日被捕學生家屬對宣氏談話提出答辯，宣氏乃再度闡明戒嚴之職權。其詞如左：查本部施行戒嚴，並不非戒嚴法第三條規定之臨時戒嚴，如屬臨時，本部得隨時自行宣告，母特核准後施行，其手續僅呈請國民政府追認而已。本巿戒嚴之開始，為前總司令部報請前軍事委員會核准，並由軍委會轉呈國民政府，奉准實施戒嚴。一年有餘，迄今未奉解嚴。又以本巿蕉苻不靖，四週多故，本部為保障四百餘萬巿民之安全，亦未考慮解嚴，此種法令與事實之依據，不容曉曉置辯所得感動。至約法第八條第二項所載，關於至遲應於廿四小時內移送審判機部審理者，在條文中明白規定，乃僅指執行逮捕或拘禁之機關，並非指有權　充之機關，否則檢察官偵查之人犯，亦得限於廿四小時內移送刑庭矣。又查約法公布施行於民國二十年六月一日，戒嚴法公布於民國廿三年十一月廿九日，提審　始於去年三月十五日施行，如認　嚴　為與約法相牴觸，則當時國民政府何以公布與三年前施行之約法相抵觸之法律，又待十二年後施行之提審法以為補救。該家長等妄引約法第八十四條以為提審之理由，更屬　誤。總之，本部依據戒嚴法而偵查之有關軍事人犯，其職權在該法中有明確規定，非軍事機關所能任意放棄，更非人民所得要求放棄。又自破獲共黨地下工作綱領後，發覺此次被捕之份子多有為共黨所策動，狂呼口號，遍貼標語，反對徵兵徵糧，煽動罷工罷巿，其與稱兵倡亂之共軍表襄相應，為眾所週知，無可掩飾之事實，該家長等為其子弟張目，不惜斷章取義，曲解法律，以圖淆惑聽聞，實屬不智之尤者云。</p>
<h3>救濟水災會　將選舉花后</h3>
<p>救濟兩廣水災委員會，即日起已展開捐募賑款工作，據悉：該會除決定　發救災獎券外，並為號召全巿各階層巿民踴躍認捐及娛樂不忘救災起見，擬舉行選舉「花國皇后」，預卜屆時盛况必不誠於去歲之選舉上海小姐云。</p>
<h3>合作社盈餘分配　社局訂三項辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕消費合作社每年所結盈餘，依照規定除提存公積金公益金及職員酬勞金外，應按照社員交易額之多寡比例分配。社社局以各合作社往往未照規定辦理，特訂三項辦法：（一）設立專册分戶登記。（二）每次交易應開發票，年終憑保存之發票計算。（三）憑交易手册載購貨證辦理，並先行通知社員保存一份。各合作社應即自本年度起一律參酌實行。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民營事業申請價配日本賠償物資辦法，業經行政院會議通過，並訓令上海巿政府遵照，巿府於奉令後，已訓令所屬各機關遵照。</p>
<p>其規定之審核標準為：一，申請人曾對本業經營著有經騐及成績者。二，組織健全足以勝任者。三，計劃完善確實可行者。四，集資數目確能達到計劃者。合於前項各款之民營事業，並且有左列情形者，得優先價配之：一，在抗戰時間對申請配購之物資，確有重大損失，並有事實證明者。二，現在業務具有急切補充之需要，經政府核定者。三，對申請配購同類之工礦業物資，其本業曾在後方確有重大貢獻者。</p>

<h3>教科書荒異常嚴重</h3>
<p>國定本主張廢止</p>
<p>鬥大華社訊〕國定本敎科書自開放版權後，請求印製之家數頗多，但事實上曾繳送樣本並已出書者，幾至絕無僅有。本市會有數家書業製版聯營，聞投資總額僅六億元，距離全國需要總額一千億元之數，有如杯水車薪，無補實際，且各地並無分店，更難供應裕如。其中資金短絀者，曾廉價預收定費，訂明本月上旬交書，但以原料印工飛漲，款項早已移作他用，因此到期無法交書，糾紛迭起，各地政府正在紛紛向京滬查詢究竟中。市肆間，除正中，商務，中華，世界，大東，開明，交通，兒童，中國文化，獨立，勝利等十一家，繼續供應相當數量外，其他版本，祗見宣傳，事實上絕少發現。今秋敎科書荒，必將異常嚴重。</p>

<h3>調節紗布市場實施方案　今日呈送經部核定</h3>
<p>杜絕紗布走私決設粵辦事處</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會委員會第六次例會，於昨日下午四時卅分起，在該會會議室舉行。到劉代主委泗英等十飲人，討論迄七時許散會。茲誌討論經過大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於發展紡織工業調節紗布市塲實施方案，其中若干細則，業予修正完畢，決由劉代主委今日携京，呈送經濟部核定後公佈施行。（二）本會爲澈底杜絕紗布走私南洋計，決定先設立廣州分辦事處。該處主持人選，業已內定。並決先派員赴廣州一帶，視察該地紗布產銷及走私情形。（三）本市複製工業要求改進現行配紗辦法，經商討一過，認爲本市複製工業配紗辦法，固待改進，外埠複製工業之記紗，亦須加考慮。決先交由本會業務處研究辦法，然後再提會商討。（四）六區棉紡公會要求改善收購棉紗等級標準，按現行標準，共分甲乙丙丁戊五級，以列入甲級者，方稱合格，標準似嫌過高，要求改爲丙等以上者，即稱合格。決議移交本會技術處會同六區公會商討辦理。（五）關於棉紗議價，決議短斯內不予調整。</p>
<p>最後據劉代主委語記者：關於運銷商之配紗問題，在紗布調節實施方案中，已有明白規定，亦擬照配，一俟經部核定，即可施行云。</p>
<h3>華股供過於求　市場交易銳減</h3>
<p>華股昨美亞取永紗而代，信和新光景福次之。業外銀根仍見緊俏，外行活動者裏足不前，業內人漸感失望，紛紛了結，形成供過於求。遞交市氣冷落，成交銳减。掉期套利步减，銀行界資金難覓對手，息價降低至一角二不到，與業外暗市相去一半，人心不振。各股除雜牌中內衣以及半熟門中法新華尙見微升外，均吿鬰然少歡。信和現遞跌達限度，商務水泥亦吿跌停，大勢頗難樂觀。</p>
<p>晨初開出尙穩，遞美亞開高至六二〇元，與即交美亞相差達五十元之多，引起套賣者爭加供給。乃將現遞美亞迫低至五六五元及五八八元。二三一號一四六號賣出現遞信和，亦退至三六八〇元及三八五〇元。九時半三五號九七號二二三號來進美亞，一八五號一五二號進信和，而有回漲。商務於九時四十分由一四二號首光掛低至停板，八九號六九號四號二二四號仍售，終現不支。十時後，聞大樓內查抄對講電話更爲嚴厲，人心大怯，美亞迫低至五二〇元（即交）及五四六元（遽交）低價。信和低至三五〇〇元跌停限度。十時二十分，一九七號二二六號一〇六號一四號趁低買進，美亞回升至五四五元及五六五元左右，水泥由一四九號掛低至跌停板，二二三號二三二號二四號三二號二三七號賣出而尙有回挫，十一時四十分後，始有回振。十二時正美亞回升至五五七元及五七八元左右，信和回升至五七〇〇元及五六〇〇元外。遞新光升至二〇五元，景福漲到一七二元以上。二二四號一五七號九七號二三五號賣出美亞，一六三號出信和，一一二號出新光，三熱門股均有小挫而以盤局結束。惟遞美亞以收市價高至五七二元，二二三號等了結，收後稍有喊低。餘股尙形平定，結果較前收計即交股信和跌停後有回，獨跌成半不到。華豐降一成弱，新光景福美亞動興永公各跌半成左右，中法新華尙形微漲，國貨麗安獨平，內衣好起半成弱，商務水泥跌停後有回，前者軋降半成弱，後者跌落成半不到，餘均微挫。遞交股計信和跌停後有回，軋跌半成强，華豐挫半成，新光永公景福微降，美亞獨平，勤興跌半成強，塲外各老股計南洋中華五洲回小半成外，餘者平疲而已。</p>
<p>套利交易集中美亞</p>
<p>現遞套利交易昨集中美亞，終以遞交乏人活動，貼價每况愈下。銀行帮苦無出路，二二〇七號一一〇號一八一號四五號以及一五五號等貼進，美亞自二五元退至一四元收市，合息價自一角九降爲一角一左右。新光自九元退至六元半，信和自二〇〇元步降至一〇五元，華豐在三元至四元之間。</p>
<p>永紗暗市現遞均有</p>
<p>永紗塲外暗市繼續有做開，除老股初開九二〇〇元，中途低至八八〇〇元最後拉高至九七〇〇元，概屬現貨交割，於次日收解。同時新股亦有做開，初開二〇五元，低至一八五元，最後爲二〇〇元至二〇五元，則屬遞交。聞息價昨開一角三分半及一角八。</p>
<h3>統債微升　外股平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨稍振作，統丙晨開七〇〇〇元，經五〇三室買進，高價達七五〇〇元而後稍定，成交仍僅百餘萬元。結果較前收計甲乙各升四百元，丙丁各好五百元，統戊則僅軋升一百元。　外股昨參差不一，猶太商有納，怡紗自晨開六五〇〇〇元起，證券帮金號業錢兌業散戶雖賣，仍被拉上至六八〇〇〇元結束，成交不多。英聯業廣所跌較多，而小型股尙呈平穩，結果蛟前收計英聯業廣各跌半成强，怡紗會德豐紙業尙平，怡啤微挫。</p>
<h3>運印外銷綢緞　付稅問題解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕我國出絲以成本不能與海外市價配合，致銷路呆滯。自中美農業技術合作團中蠶絲專家休白氏遍赴各地考察後，擬就計劃醫，建議我當局將原料織造綢緞，另闢途徑，向印度方面推銷，以爭取中華綢緞海外銷路，述同工繳，亦可換取外匯。經有關方面組織絲織品管理協導委會負責督導，上海絲織品產銷聯營公司聯合各織綢廠向中信局依照規定手續，絡續取得生絲二千二百担，人造絲二千四百箱，開工織造外銷綢緞，預計至八月底，可生產外銷綢緞十一萬匹。按照目前海外市價，全部可値美金六百萬元，依照生活指數前後推算工繳共計國幣六百億元。截至上月底已運赴孟買之製成品爲六萬二千匹，至遲遲未成交原因，乃係我方主張以出口估値付稅，彼方堅持以當地市價付稅，經更審交涉，得一折衷辦法，將首批至三批裝到之貨，完全依照我國出口佔價付稅，其餘則以當地市價計値。此項消息，昨已由我駐印代表報吿遞達此間。</p>
<h3>銀行業公會　今開理監會議</h3>
<p>審查十四屆常會各提案</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會第十四屆常曾，已定於本月廿六日，假市商會舉行。刻該會已收到各會員銀行之提案十餘件，大部係對修訂同業業規之意見案。該會爲先事整理提案計，決定於今日下午三時，舉行理監事會議，俾同時對各項議案，作初步之審查。聞該會會員，現共一百四十二家。會員代表，按其資本額之大小派遣，最多七人，最少一人，共計四百三十一人云。</p>
<h3>紡建籌製蔴袋　月產約二十萬隻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司第一製一麻廠，刻因國內蔴袋供應量奇絀，需要甚旺，決擬每月產製蔴袋二十萬隻。現聞滬杭一帶黃蔴產量頗豐，價亦合宜，擬先行採購備用云。</p>
<h3>鋼珠軸承製造廠　請示日機器詳情</h3>
<p>〔本報讀〕利用日本賠償設備，計劃設立之聯合鋼珠軸承製迭廠，籌備工作正積極進行。日前該廠召集人呈文工商輔導處，略謂鋼珠軸承之製造，至爲複雜，工作母機之設備，又與普通機器有異，歐美與日本之製造程序不同。過去之日本賠償機器清單，僅將機器之數量列入，未說明其部別性能及工作程序；故特提出請求四點，轉請駐日代表團辦理：（一）應行拆遷機器之名稱，每部機器之重量及所需馬力。（二）全部應行拆遷機器中，有無損壞。（三）該軸承廠在日本原有廠房及廠　之平面圖，請即晒示。（四）該廠過去出品之名稱及最大生產力，與採取之工作程序，除此四項請求外，並希望　派員赴日作實地考察。</p>
<h3>收購箱茶期限　准予延長五日</h3>
<p>三十五年度茶貸案內，受押箱茶處理辦法，四聯總處前以茶商借用國家行局款項收購茶葉押借幾近一年。今理事曾決定中信局依據各茶商所提國內茶葉價格，全部收購，限七月二十日截止。茲茶商復要求將收購價格提高，該處今復提出商討。咸以政府協助茶商收購運銷，已予茶商最大之便利，過去押款數額，一再增加，茶商血本，早已收回。現所訂收購價格，亦依據茶商於五月間所提之請求，此次復一再請求提高價格，實屬過份。經於昨日決議，所請求碍難照辦，惟准將收購截止期限，展至七月二十五日爲止。</p>
<h3>人造絲工廠　所需資本過鉅　建設相當困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市人造絲公會負責人稱：我國欲自建人造絲工廠，尙有相當困亂，因所需資本過鉅。如建立日出人造絲十噸之工廠一所，即需資本一千萬美金。月前美某大人造絲廠代表來滬時，曾與我國某實業鉅子洽商在華建廠之事，合作條件爲由美方供給棧器，由華商措籌資本五百萬美金，作爲建屋費及流動資金。因有事實上之困難，並未完全洽妥。過去日本曾在安東辦有人造絲廠一所，每”產量達廿五噸，紡建公司原擬將此廠南遷，於七月在滬開工。但東北局北勢幾經變遷，該廠損失慘重，最後僅運出設備十五卡車，故此項遷廠計劃已成泡影。以本部人絲市場而論，　黔輪圖　時，將帶回人絲一千餘箱。目前市價略跌，每箱售價在二千七百萬元左右。將來日本貿易開放後，來源較多，價格或有下跌可能。在戰前，人造絲每箱售價爲一百二十元左右，此時全市每月之需要量為八千箱左右；去年年底人絲每箱售三百萬左右，全市需要量約四千箱；今售價已迫近三千萬，需要量減至每月二千箱左右。</p>
<h3>秦皇島煤斤　萬餘噸抵滬</h3>
<p>燃料委員會，日前派遣巨輪唐山號，漢格馬勒號兩艘，赴秦皇島裝運煤斤，業於昨日抵滬。分別由開　裝來煤斤甚鉅，計唐山號裝到塊煤七千噸，漢格馬勒號裝到煤屑七千三百噸。該兩輪日內卸貨後，尙將續往秦皇島運煤。又合灣基隆煤磺，亦將有巨額煤斤運滬，該會已派輪前往裝運云。</p>
<h3>紗布均止回漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開仍疲，後以隔日價跌過鉅，銀根轉鬆，塲內人心趨俏，搜吸活動，市勢由疲轉堅。結果四二支藍鳳因做開較多，價比上日回升一百萬元，爲一千八百二十萬元。廿支特雙馬爲一千一百八十萬，回升六十萬元。雙馬紗亦漲八十萬，爲一千零八十萬元。其餘四二支寳光水月，四十支金城，三十二支藍鳳，廿支大女人鐘，十六支光明紅蜂，十支意子軍等粗細紗，亦均回挺四五十萬至一百萬元不等</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，亦以銀根鬆弛，散戶及業中人逢低進購，客帮亦有堆令星添辦，市勢止跌回升。收盤結果十二磅龍頭頭布比上日回漲一萬元，爲四十二萬八千元。五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴等各檔細布亦均轉升七八千元至一萬元，四君子及金蓮妙舞嗶嘰客胃頗健，軋升一萬至一萬六千元，其餘元布色布及士林布等，仍站原盤。</p>
<h3>呢羢市銷清淡</h3>
<p>毛織物呢羢市面邇仍內外堅秀，夏令貨除外，大多數均在向高峰推進中。惟成交則殊淸淡，因有實力者在上前兩週中咸已有相當吸進。秋冬呢羢行情絡續上漲不已，吃本加重，其即欲採購者，亦皆暫抱觀望態度。</p>
<h3>製皂主要原料　柏油騰漲原因</h3>
<p>近日來製皂燭主要原料柏油，上漲甚烈，影響肥皂工業成本甚鉅。記者昨走訪該業中權威人士，據談稱：柏油主要產地爲漢口，荆州，蘭溪，嘉興等，而其中以漢口爲最大之集散地。月來各產地運滬柏油數量極少，因產地存貨亦日趨稀薄，且滬地資力較大之肥皂廠，亦有自往產地購辦，致當地油價亦甚俏利。現漢口柏汕，每司馬担亦達一百四十萬元，與滬地價格，不相上下。且每日電報，尙在不斷報漲聲中。本市汕商，以滬地與產地價格相等，在運費龐大，及漢口匯率又高之今日，實不願無利可圖而前往採辦。而本市谷製皂工廠以天氣炎熱，肥皂市需較殷，類多增加生產，柏油實銷旺盛，亦屬至確。在此供供不應求情形之事，其價格之日趨飛漲，實不可免。與今春供過於求，價格下瀉之現象，迥然相反。並稱近日柏油喊價雖高，然市塲交易甚爲寥寥，市面籌碼日薄固爲主因，即手執存貨者，亦皆擯持觀望，以柏油新貨須待秋後方能上市云。</p>
<h3>食米初堅後平　高白粳略見挺升</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧七千餘石，市况早堅午平，粳秈米高貨畧挺三五千元，中次定局。白元仍少變化。</p>
<p>麵粉連跌之後，物極思及，回升二三千元，但收市仍懈，形勢則欲漲乏力。油餅雜糧全面下降，豆餅去化甚細，續跌二三千元。營口餅亦跌三四千元。麩皮步削一二千元，黃豆銷化不動，再跌五六千至萬元。　豆南洋去胃消淡，逐步下游，挫落萬元。生仁節節下降，續跌萬元。芝蔴去路亦呆，繼續狂跌一二萬元。</p>
<p>苞米北洋停辦，回挫三五千元，蠶豆消化清閒，逐見修削，再低二三千元。莞豆平正。油市直綫下瀉，豆油再跌一二萬元，蔴油猛跌三四萬元，菜汕狂落三四萬元，淸油亦跌二三萬元。生油亦短萬元，外埠停辦，本街看望，仍難樂觀。</p>
<h3>阿根廷米糧　暫時未能運華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局購料易貨處經理何墨林，爲協助我駐阿根廷大使館談判中阿貿易易貨前宜，曾於本年初，首途赴阿，前後共歷六閱月，刻已公畢返滬。據悉：中阿貿易，本擬採取易貨方式，惟阿政府則希望多辦出口貿易，其中尤以米糧之出口爲主，刻以價格尙未獲致協議，故阿米暫時尙未能運華。又何氏在返國途中，曾過美視察該局在美經辦之購料業務。一般印象，堪稱良佳云。</p>
<h3>綠茶外銷平淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市抽珍珍眉等綠茶，仍因吐納失調，交易未見暢旺，他若祁門陳花香及低檔紅茶，午昌茶葉公司續有吸進，其趨勢以賣戶心思算餧，一致有勁。　於各種內銷　，本街店莊及客帮雖有　胃，　受　明影編，乃皆束手觀望，成交數量銳藩，情况則尚穏俏。茲據業中人云：本年度祁門新紅茶，最近安徽茶業公司等，已有裝到，但因採製成本浩大。喊價驚人，聞每担竟達三百萬元左右，而脫手能否順利，尙未可知。</p>
<p>又訊：天祥洋行悌海蘭泰號，裝茶葉二百二十餘噸，保和德行勞克斯米號裝二百餘噸，均於昨日離滬運歐。</p>
<h3>輸廣會討論　絲茶外銷問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於十五十六兩日，連續舉行會議，均由陳光甫主席，對茶葉及生絲之外銷間題，曾從詳研究，原則上雖已獲具若干定論，惟技術上之實施問題，尙待繼續擬劃，故未遽作決議案。至收購桐油猪　改進辦法，刻正循各出口商之請，提交該會猪鬃小組會研究中，聞對收購方式及價格，均可望有所改進云。</p>
<h3>麝香無法出口　國內外價格倒掛</h3>
<p>康蜀兩省麝香，當地槪以米茶易貨。惟最近受當地米茶價格激漲影響，致麝香收價亦逐步高升。康省麝香戰前曾暢銷英法等國，蜀省麝香則僅銷國內藥材業。故後者採辦者較少，聞目前本市到貨頗多，但無法出口，原因係與國外市價相差懸殊。現每市斤售價約八百萬元，而最近國外市價尙不到三百五十萬元云。</p>
<h3>輸入輸出兩委會　全經會考慮合併</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會，刻正考慮將輸入管制委員會及轍出推廣委員會合併，按該兩會自成立以來，對於促進我國對國際貿易成績斐然，刻全經濟會爲加强輸入輸出之聯繫及效用起見，故有合併之意。</p>
<h3>華南輸出入委會　各單位代表派定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：華南輸出入管理委員會，自奉准設立以來，經積極籌備後，刻已組成單位十個，各單位代表，亦均已派定，日內可望正式成立云。</p>
<p>原料筆鉛仍准輸入</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各大鉛筆廠商，前曾以國外製迭之特種鉛筆，國內無法製造，曾一再呈請輸管會非限額分配處，准予輸入。茲悉：該項呈請，已遭批駁。惟聞對原料筆鉛一項，則仍准照常輸入云。</p>
<h3>火柴業缺乏原料</h3>
<p>擬請輸管會提高進口量</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市火柴業，現深感缺乏原料之危機。按火柴之主要原料爲赤磷及氣酸鉀，在輸入管理之商品表中，均列入第二類之化學品中。但本年第一季之化學原料進口限額僅爲八十萬美金，而以上兩項原料僅配得七千餘美金。在此數量中，一部份復需配與化學原料商，故廠家能獲得者，爲數殊小。我國之兵工署雖能自製赤磷及氣酸鉀，但本身需要甚大，無餘力供應民廠。按本市火柴廠全年所需之原料總額，約爲四百萬美金，目前之限額與實際需要相去過遠，故除少數存貨特多之大廠外，大部份之火柴廠均不能發揮最大生產力。現聞火柴業方面，擬與輸管會洽商，將此兩項必需原料，劃出於第二表化學品之列，如此進口量可提高，方能滿足各廠之正當需要。除原料不足之外，工資之提高亦使廠家感覺負担沉重。以銷路而論，外貨無進口，救濟品市上亦少見。國內之銷塲過去華南向由此間供給，近來在市上已發現來自廣東之火柴，爲數尙不多。南貨北銷之主要理由，爲華南原料易於取得，故成本較本市爲輕云。</p>
<h3>捲菸市況挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，晨開人心仍堅，喊價即吿挺秀。塲內利買流言傳播，各方納胃甚健，並傳頤中公司在加稅前有停止派貨說，市上籌碼不充，塲內進多出少，市氣靑雲直上。午市結果十支大英烟每箱比上日繼漲二十六萬元，爲八百七十萬。老刀亦續升十七萬，爲七百五十五萬元。華廠烟以美麗牌去化較旺，每條軋升有三千七百元之巨，其餘金鼠克雷斯三貓銀行白蘭地大都跟踪上升三五百元至一千三百元，惟美貨駱駝六根馬力斯等條燜及聽頭烟仍站定。、</p>
<h3>杉木堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日杉木市況，略見堅穩，大條二千七百元已難購到，洋松市見軟疲。</p>
<h3>毛巾被毯等業籲請　限制棉織品輸入</h3>
<p>下月中旬，日本開放對外貿易，將以大批工業製成品運銷我國。我工業界人士已一致表示反對，輸管會方面則表示非限額以內之物資，絕對禁止輸入。惟本市毛巾被毯業棉織業等公會，以現行之進出口貿易暫行辦法附表四，禁止進口貨品，僅列絲織品，未列棉織品。故根據輸管會此一規定，日貨棉織品仍有來華傾銷之可能。就目前我國棉織品出產情形而論，自給之外，尙有餘剩，可以運銷南洋羣島，無需仰賴外貨。且以戰後幣制而論，日本因其通貨膨脹之程度，遠不如我國之甚，故工料兩項，均較我國爲廉。一旦大量傾銷，勢難抵禦。我毛巾被毯業必無生存餘地。數十萬職工，立有失業之處。故各該公會已聯名向財政經濟兩部呼籲，要求將棉製品補列爲禁止進口物品，預杜日貨傾銷云。</p>

<h3>科學和迷信勢不兩立</h3>
<p>— 并里</p>
<p>在端午節前，曾有人來信提議：仿前年把「淸明令節」定爲「植樹節」辦法，主張也來把陰曆五月五日，定爲「防疫節」，其理由有三：第一，凡屬內地人家，每逢五月五日。一定要在立屋正樑，高貼一張從城隍廟送來的「驅瘟逐疫的神符」。這不啻是提醒人們，應當注意夏令衛生；否則，就容易被瘟疫所乘而染病了。爲其貼在立屋，如果撤開神鬼迷信不談，可視爲暮鼓晨鐘般的警吿牌啦。第二，端午那天，還有許多應時舉動，譬如澆洒雄黃酒咧，不啻是噴洒消毒。燒蒼朮白芷咧，不啻是黨氣消毒。把艾葉萬　蒜頭懸掛在窗前戶口咧，不啻是揮發劑的空間消毒。這都含有居室消毒的意義；吾人何不推廣之，利用原有的遺風習俗，去提倡科學呢—第三，正因爲適合時令的舉措，因勢利導，自比一切新設計和新作爲，容易引起一般人的興趣；其有助於衛生當局推行政令，必非淺鮮呢！</p>
<p>話雖不差；但是事實不然。因爲舊時習俗都含極濃厚的傳統迷信。迷信是科學的敵人。想把迷信和科學調和一下；這種企圖，以前已有許多人，屢試而屢吿失敗。今後不必再蹈覆轍，以免浪費人力與物力！始就夏令衛生說：在夏天時症之多，確已不分老幼，盡人知曉。而其發病之縣，令人猝不及備，又是有目共賭。旣屬不爭而像鐵一般的事實；可是要說明其致病原由，不在鬼神作崇。而在乎氣溫太高的關係，和許多當令所滋蕃的微生物，活動的結果；恐誰也不會容易理解！那麼現在要利用舊俗端午的習慣，來提倡科學，又何能濟事？總之科學和迷信，不能並立。要指導科學，就該破除迷信！不但一般迷信世界上有瘟神的，要他明白古人所指「瘟神」，其實就是夏令的太陽（對中署說的；就是俗稱發痧；亦就是科學上所稱日射病熱射病說的）迷信社會向有疫鬼的，要他知道古人所指疫鬼，其實就是細菌（對霍亂傷寒赤痢說的）和原虫（對瘧疾廻歸熱說的）；在事實上是不可能的！就退一步，敎人要認淸古人所指五毒，未必能立立刻致人染病；而大家向來不以爲有毒的，像蒼蠅蚊虫幛螂臭虫虱蚤五種小生物，却當常足以媒介疾病；恐亦不是易事呢！那麼在端午節，敎人不洒雄黃酒，而改洒DDT不燒蒼朮白芷，而改燒硫黃。不懸艾共萬蒲，而改縣像新式厠所用的辟臭劑，（俗稱樟腦塊）；是否能行得通呢？如果行不通，則改端午節爲「防疫節」，到底有何意義？</p>
<p>以管見看來，敎育不普及，民智難啓發！這是一大前題。如果一般人知識程度日漸提高，迷信自不攻而破；科學亦不提倡而會深入人心。但是敎育問題，亦豈一朝一夕，所能奏功呢？就像目前社會間的一般通人說，不是都變過現代科學敎育麼？最近看見某大報，載着一篇來信，主張公共車輛，應該設法消毒。尤其是黃包車，往往載運重病人，認有傳染危險；所以提出急須消毒的要求。這樣主張，固然合理，値得人人同情。可是文中，又談及乘客應知自防方法，就是敎人出門要帶八卦丹。乘坐黃包車時，不妨口含一角。誠不知此文是否爲宣傳八卦丹的變相廣吿？如果作者的確是眞心誠意，提倡衛生。那麼主張口含八卦丹而可以防傳染時症；其科學知識的修養程度，也可想而知了！吾想此公，也許已知道，夏天出門，要帶帽帶傘，以避强烈的日光。還有前要打防疫針，增强對於霍亂傷寒的抗病力，以免萬一不幸的傳染。可是此文中，隻字不提；反而提到口含八卦丹，豈不類乎想入非非麼？要也非別，恐怕爲了迷信中醫五蘊六氣謬說；認爲八卦丹可以扶正氣，辟病邪呢！</p>
<p>由此看來，迷信神權，固然要不得，迷信不科學的舊說，又豈要得？總之科學，和迷信不能並立，吾人今後所應努力的，正覺前途艱鉅，尙難以道里計呢！</p>
<h3>防止霍亂！</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>最近，京滬時常傳說已經發現眞性霍亂，這個可怕的謠言，對於神經過敏的人，無異宣佈了死刑。許多人感到莫名的不安，許多人搖頭嘆氣，悲世道不古，天災人禍雙管看下</p>
<p>霍亂是夏令的急性傳染病，蔓延迅速而廣反，數小時可以致人於死，並且多人受其害。一八五四年倫敦的霍亂死亡率升至每一萬人二百二十，一八九二年德國漢堡的霍亂，有六四〇〇〇〇人，從八月十七日起，至十月二十三日止，染疫的有一萬七千餘一人，因疫而死亡的有八六〇五人，最利害的一天，得霍亂的有一〇〇〇霍亂在我國流行的情形，亦十分可怕，民國二十一年黃河水災時大流行，二十五年的流行，二十八年的大流行，三十一年又流行，三十四年大流行遍及全國，其死亡與患者，無正確統計可供參考。去年霍亂流行，患者五四一九七人，死亡一五四六〇人，死亡率百分之二八·五三。上海市五月二十三日起，至八月底止，證實翟亂患者達四二四三人，死亡三三四八人，若連同未能證實的疑似病例，則達一一八三七人，自然還有許多遺漏。但這鉅大的數字，己足以顯示霍亂流行的猖獗，侵襲的可怕。這許多無辜的死者，尙存在人們的記憶中。</p>
<p>霍亂是是一種特殊的急性腸胃傳染病，病勢進行很速，上吐下瀉，爲主要症狀，並有虛脫抽筋，全身乏力，手足發冷，口喝，昏迷等。因病人時常吐瀉，失水很多，眼眶與指羅等都要喜，其嘔吐物爲果汁樣，可以檢查出此病的病原體—霍亂弧菌。</p>
<p>病人的大便與嘔吐物中，有很多的霍亂菌，這種病菌傳到他人的腸胃中，如果這人的身體對於堆亂弧菌沒有抵抗力，短至數小時，長至三五天，就要生霍亂，至於這種病菌侵入人體所經過的這路，大概有下面幾種：</p>
<p>1手　由手傳染霍亂是因爲霍亂患者的吐瀉物會沾汚了患者的身體與衣服被褥等用其，所以接觸過霍亂患者的身體或是衣服被褥用具，甚或用糞澆菜的時候，用手打撲伏在霍亂患者吐瀉物的蒼蠅等，都可以使到手上沾有翟亂病菌，在吃東西之前，倘沒有洗過手，這是一個很容易傳染的機會。</p>
<p>2水　由水傳染霍亂，是因爲霍亂患者的吐瀉物，未經處置，任意傾瀉，便滲入水中，倘飲用了這種汚染的水，或是吃了這種汚水所製的食物，都可以得患霍亂。</p>
<p>3蒼蠅　由蒼蠅傳染霍亂是因爲蒼蠅好在骯謙的地方鑽撲，所以很容易因爲牠鑽撲過霍亂患者的吐瀉物，於是把霍亂弧菌粘在牠的身上，再常他飛到食物上的時候，就會將這些病菌送到我們的食物裏去，我們吃進這些食物，也就可以得到霍亂。</p>
<p>記着，霍亂是由口傳染的。病原體的來源，除病人本身外，且有由「帶菌人」而來的。所謂帶菌者就是自己不在生病，而身微中卻帶有病原菌的人。患霍亂初愈的人，他的糞便中，仍有霍亂病菌，這就是帶萬人。還有一種人，自己並不生病，可是常由糞便中排出霍亂病菌。接觸病人的人亦可能爲暫時的帶菌人，他們可以將霍亂病菌傳播與健康的人。</p>
<p>現在，我們旣已知霍亂是怎樣傳染與人的，便知道如何去防制霍亂了。霍亂是一種經口傳染的夏令傳染病，若果撲滅了病原，切斷了傳染途徑，自然可以防制的。現在試分作兩方面來說：</p>
<p>（一）個人方面</p>
<p>第一，我們應當要養成食前必洗手和不用手放東西進口的習慣。因爲我們的手隨時會接觸各種東西，我們不知什麼時候會偶然接觸着汚染過霍亂患者吐　物的東西。所以動洗手，和不要拿東西進口是一種妥善的預防方法。此外注意不與患者接近，接近後注意消毒。</p>
<p>第二，煮沸所有飲用水，如爲飲料，盥洗，洗滌餐具，及食品器具所用的水。水源並應經適常的保護，飲用時需予消毒，使霍亂弧菌不能生存。</p>
<p>第三，防止蒼蠅繁殖，廚房，食堂用紗罩，自然切實改善環境衛生，妥善處理糞便亦十分重要的。</p>
<p>第四，不吃生冷食品，不飲生水，不吃攤販零售的瓜果，漱口刷牙亦不用生水，不要暴飲暴食，這都是簡易便於實行的重要辦法。</p>
<p>第五，增加人體對霍亂的抵抗力，每年注射霍亂疫苗一次。但切注意者，若果注射後有寒熱紅腫的現象，這不要緊，並無妨害，注射以後，確有免疫性，可保持三至六月，但這並不是萬無一失。若果有大量的霍亂菌進入腸胃，仍然會發病，不過，病勢輕得多。所以打防疫針後，也要謹愼飲食才行。</p>
<p>（二）公共方面</p>
<p>第一，發現有疑似霍亂病人，立刻報吿衛生機關，診斷是否眞爲霍亂病人。如果是眞性霍亂病人，應立刻將病人隔離起來，不要使與健康人接近。病人的大便及嘔吐物，立即澈底消毒，所有病人使用或其所有之物件，必須消毒，病人吃剩的食物應該焚毀。第二，與病人接近的人，自末次感受接觸可能之日起五天，予以留騐。如大便內有霍亂弧菌，則時間延長。接觸者並立即予以免疫注射。</p>
<p>第三，搜尋未報吿的病例及帶菌者，調查可能爲汚濁飲水傳染，抑或染汚而未煮熟的食物傳染，以撲滅病源。</p>
<p>第四，侍護者之嚴格實行個人防範，週密注意淸潔，每次服侍病人或接觸吐瀉物及染汚的物件後，手即消毒。避免在病人房間內飲食任何食物，或自病室取出食物，並禁止侍護病人者進入廚房。</p>
<p>第五，霍亂盛行區域，祇許食用煮熟的食物。飲食品煮熟或煮熟後，應防免蒼蠅及他人觸及染汚。</p>
<p>霍亂是確可以防制，並予以撲滅的。歐美衛生事業進步的國家，「霍亂」一字已爲字典中的名詞，不再如我國流行的猖獗，殺人的眾多。在霍亂未發現以前，嚴密注意，防止發生，這個工作是人民與衛生當局共同的責任，單靠任一方面的努力，都不會成功的。希望市民切實注意夏令衛生，個人衛生方面努力。並希望衛生當局早作一個通盤有系統的完整計劃及辦法，防制霍亂來襲。</p>
<p>我們認淸了淤亂怎樣侵害人類，我們便知如何自衛。以往死亡的敎訓，便是今天自衞的能力。不要再讓霍亂這個病成爲我國可恥而可怕的流行病。</p>
<h3>為什麼會發燒？</h3>
<p>— 集廷</p>
<p>家庭中如果發現了一個發燒的病人，無論是成人或小孩，馬上會使這和諧的氣氛，變而爲憂鬱，暗淡，發燒是常見的病病，很多的疾病都有發燒的病狀，因此發燒最平常也最重要，爲什麼發燒呢？這，我們得先明瞭身體正常的情形。</p>
<p>身體的熱量是由各種新陳代謝而產生的，過多的熱由皮膚和肺的蒸發和傳導放散出來，維繫體溫的平衡，肌肉的動作可生熱很多，但藉皮膚血管的擴張和汗液的排洩，及呼吸加速的散熱，而减少了身體熱量，如果體溫傾向低降，或氣候寒冷，皮膚血管則收縮，汗液减少，使熱量儲於體內，以維常溫，人體中正常的溫度，是華氏九十八度六，（攝氏三十七度），但是也因時間和部位而稍差異，如肛門的溫度就比口裏高一度，晚間的溫度又比早晨高些，這是因爲工作與休息的原故。</p>
<p>大腦中有專司體溫的中樞，使體溫保持正常，如果體溫中樞受到刺激，體溫即顯變動，動物實騐以針刺其體溫中樞（紋狀體或下視丘）體溫立即增高，則呈發燒的現象，所以在正常的情形下，體溫是被它管理得很有條理的。</p>
<p>發燒實在是身體一種極複難的現象，不但皮膚的調節機能起了變化，消化，呼吸，血液循環都因影響而受了改變，發燒之前，皮膚的血管收縮，血液减少，熱量的發散也因而减低，體溫自然增高，所以常在發燒前皮膚血管收縮而覺得發寒，發燒是一種好現象，換句話說：發燒對身體是有益的，發燒是身體生理的自衛現象，身體像行政的組織，發現了敵人——病菌，侵入身體，主宰的中樞，立即發出了捕滅的號令，全力攻之，消滅敵人，我們知道血液　有很多防禦的物質，除了一些看不見的，不有很多有噬菌作用的細胞，如果發現了病菌，它們都渠中力量，奮勇鬥事，直至消滅病菌爲止，發燒的時候，血液循環增加，增强了運輸兵力的動力，使噬菌作用的細胞更加活躍，可以加述的消滅病菌，同時有些病菌在正常的體溫中能生長，在高溫環境下則不能生存，發高燒的時候所產生的抗體也還較常溫時多，所以發燒無形中增加了抵抗病菌的力量，這像增加了防衛治安的兵力一樣。</p>
<p>在又乾又熱的環境中，許多喝水少，熱不能放散，或者在氣候熱而空氣潮濕的地方。體溫不能蒸發，都可以增高體溫而有發燒的現象，這呌「中暑」，多半在夏天的時候發生，這是身體體溫調節機能受了阻礙而至，如果中暑的時間渦長，或發熟太高，常有生命的危險。</p>
<p>很多疾病可以由發燒的過程中來判斷病病，如像瘧疾，除了少數的例外，誰都知道是先冷再熱後出汗，這可由它的熱型而帮助疾病的診斷，再如傷寒，肺炎和回歸熱之類，都可由它發燒的情形來帮助醫生診斷。</p>
<p>要知道是不是發燒，或者燒的程度如何？唯一的方法是用體溫計測量，家庭中體溫計是必備的物品，有了體溫計可節省很多浪費的經濟和精神，减少了不必要的着急，主婦們更應俱備一些發燒的常識，可以預防不良的後果，增進家庭的健康和幸福。</p>
<h3>新鮮牛乳之醫藥觀</h3>
<p>— 壽梧培青</p>
<p>牛乳爲液體食品，乃滋養素之集國，脂肪蛋白質炭化水素礦鹽水分維他命等，無不畢備。幼自襁褓，長及皆耄，四季成宜。或有替代膳食，畢生應用者。或有病臥床第，暫時充飢者。更有多數嬰孩，持此爲生命綫者，其營養之重要性，無待　述。推時際盛夏，氣候炎熱，飲用鮮乳，自有其注意之價値。</p>
<p>（一）鮮乳之品質　新鮮牛乳以純潔優超之品質爲上選，所謂A字牛乳是也。B字牛乳則成份較差。TT字樣之牛乳，則表明該乳牛已經鐵勃固林（藥名）之試騐Tuberculin證明無結核病之意也。早是送來之牛乳，早晨飲之。下午飲用之牛乳，下午送之，則鮮度不减，而品質無損</p>
<p>（二）鮮乳之保存　鮮乳保存，夏日頗爲不易。出棚之鮮乳，在不變質量之條件下，無永久保存之方法。如有冷氣設備，（電氣冰箱冷藏庫等）則保存便利。早晨送來之乳，除飲用外，多餘之乳，可用者沸法消毒。消毒之後，述鍋待冷，置於冰箱中，待下午應用。如須保存一晝夜以上者，恐非所宜。未經消毒之牛乳，不可冷藏，否則，亦易受腐。</p>
<p>（三）鮮乳所含之細菌　鮮乳內含微生物極多，初次擠出之牛乳，含菌更甚，入後漸少。加以空中飛揚之灰塵，牛棚沾染之汚穢，擠乳者不潔之手指，未經消毒之器皿，其菌類之繁多，自不待言。國外正式給照之乳棚，其所產出之牛乳，未經消毒前，其菌數不得超過每1c.c.一萬。較次之牛乳，每工1c.c約爲五萬。</p>
<p>（四）鮮乳對熱力之感應　新鮮牛乳加熱至華氏12O度時，表面結成霏薄之乳皮，乃因酪素Casein一部份被分解浮游上面乾結所致。底部有叢厚之沉殿，粘着四沿，乃因鈣鹽溶化所結成。若煮沸較久，則鍋內發生特異脆香之乳臭，乃因乳蛋白所含硫化物分解所致。同時成焦貨之色，一部乳脂上浮，因之口味較遜，營養力减退。</p>
<p>（五）鮮乳消毒之方法　新鮮牛乳於飲用之先，必須重行消毒。出棚之牛乳，雖己經巴斯徒氏方法Pasteurization消毒，但不常可靠。蓋自裝瓶以至送人定戶手內，中間相隔之時問，恒在數小時之久，而途中投遞運送，奔波動搖，風塵雨雪，難免沾汚。非經重新消毒，礙難安心飲用用。按巴氏方法，將牛乳加熱至華氏145度，歷三十分之久，使之急速變冷，其優點在乳內成分不變，維他命損失極微，而牛乳則有消毒之功。世界各國，均採川之，惟因非訓練有毒者，難能施行。家庭之內，則應以煮沸法較爲簡便。即將牛乳倒入鍋內，加熱片刻，將沸騰時，沖將鍋蓋揭開，第致外溢，約二分鐘取出，稍冷飲之。他若重湯鍋煮乳，則最穩妥便當。惟費時過久，爲其唯一缺點。未曾消毒之生牛乳，危險特甚，萬勿飲用。</p>
<p>（六）鮮乳能傳何種疾病　鮮牛乳傳染病之可能性極大，癆病爲最可怕者。其次則爲猩紅熱，喉症，傷寒’副傷寒，痢疾，霍亂等。再次則爲口蹄疫，炭疽症等。且可因用水不潔，而引起傳染，夏季兒童之腹瀉，因不良之乳汁所引起者，不在少數。故通都大邑，衛生當局，恒嚴格管理，藉免疾病之傳播。</p>
<p>（七）鮮乳對藥品之影響　新鮮牛乳對於藥品有直接之關係，故病家飲乳服藥，應有時間參差之規化。如含汞含銀含碘之藥品，與乳同食，有减損藥力之作用。與各種溶菌液Phago同服，且可减滅其効力。故急性藥物中毒時，醫師大量施用新鮮牛乳，中和腐蝕藥品之毒力，並潤滑胃腸粘膜之侵襲。至於內服礆性藥而如石灰水小蘇打等，阻止牛乳之凝結，在胃內成流動狀態。酸性藥品，如醋酸乳酸稀鹽酸等，則鮮乳迅速結成硬塊，不易消化。胃內本有酸素之分泌，故牛乳入胃，凝結成塊，幸有酵　之補助，乳塊得以逐漸消化。乳兒嘔出乳塊，即爲酸凝未化者，乃其明證。</p>
<p>結諭　新鮮牛乳，爲富有滋養之混合物。其功效確較乾燥之奶粉及濃縮之聽頭牛乳爲佳。工業化學用爲監製人造絲人造橡皮人造玻璃等之天然原料。軍事化學用爲製造某種炸藥之原料。由醫學立塲言，鮮牛乳之用途更廣。因其爲流汁食物，使用便利，舉凡病人非病人，滋補消遣，莫不應用。而佐藥品之不足更以此爲唯一之補助劑。</p>
<p>退一步言，新鮮牛乳，因含豐富之脂肪質及蛋白質，亦有不適於或種疾病者，或爲非大衆所共知，茲舉例以明之：</p>
<p>（一）初生嬰兒，母乳不足，以新鮮牛乳替代飲用，歷相當時期，嬰孩什九消瘦，且抵抗力薄弱，乏天然免疫力，易罹疾病。</p>
<p>（二）較長乳兒，母乳不足，用以混合喂哺，易致消化不良，發生面部濕疹，（俗稱奶癬）或其他皮膚疾患。</p>
<p>（三）急性腎臟炎，皮膚浮腫，减少蛋白質之輸入，使尿液排洩暢通。</p>
<p>（四）傷寒副傷寒，高熱時期，每多腹部膨脹。爲减少其酵氣之產生，免飲牛乳。</p>
<p>（五）痢疾腸炎，頻頻大便，中雜血液點膜，爲减低細菌繁殖起見，牛乳亦非所宜。</p>
<p>（六）慢性消化不良之兒童，腹部膨隆，洪洪作聲，爲减少其腸部之膨動，新鮮牛乳亦非所宜。</p>
<p>（七）肥胖患者，體重二百磅以上，爲避免　盛之飲食，及多量脂肪之吸收，新鮮牛乳，亦非所宜。（八）痛風患者，尿酸排洩不暢，疼痛異常，免飮牛乳，藉以促進　氣之排出。</p>
<p>（九）特種神精病患者，及神經過敏者，避免飲用，藉以避免牛乳之異臭。</p>
<p>（十）哮喘病患者，免飲牛乳，有時可免陣喘之激發。</p>
<p>（十一）百日咳患兒之痙攣期，飲用牛乳，易使全部嘔出，反以半固體食物爲宜。</p>
<p>（十二）黃疸病患者，　管閉寒，應减少牛乳之飮用，藉免刺激膽汁之分泌。</p>
<p>（十三）急性蘭尾炎之初期，在開刀以前，應完全停止牛乳之進食，藉以减少腸道之電動。</p>
<p>（十四）施用全身蒙藥之清晨，應停給牛乳，藉免　，藥期內嘔吐時發生氣管窒息之危險。</p>
<p>几此轉種，乃　大者，但各病各期，各醫各見，旁及國籍地域，人事舊規，個人習慣，個人癖忌，各不相同。或亦有認爲非絕對切合者，但　之醫學觀點，未可認爲厚非，質諸讀者。以爲然否？</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>乳鶯</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>我們搬到現在的住址已經有好幾年了，在這衖堂裏還有另外一家人家，是和我們一起搬來的。這家人家，正像華資華斯的一首詩裏所說的：「我們共七個人」，父親，母親，兩個兒子，三個女兒。可是沒有多久，大兒子和他的父親相繼死去，七個人就變成五個；現在又變成四個，因爲當中的女兒出嫁了。、</p>
<p>除了這出嫁的女兒以外，其餘的幾位，都不過四尺來高。可是他們有一個引人的地方，就是他們家裏一天到晚充滿着音樂。我們剛來的時候，就聽見那二女兒在那兒唱歌吊嗓子，她的嗓音非常宏亮，旣不怕人家看，也不怕人家聽，也不怕人家笑。她不個唱歌，還用樂器來伴奏；起初是一隻風琴，後來變了鋼琴。這鋼琴是她的情人巷她借來的，可是她不會彈，簡直宮商不辨；幸而她的歌倒唱得很好，頗有某女高音的作風。而她也刻意學她，越學越像，我們就想想她大概是在小學校裏當音樂敎師的。但她那個琴怎麼能爲人師表呢？三個女兒之中，頂大的不喜歡唱，頂小的則跟着她二姐學，有時候那個第二的兒子也要隨着亨兩聲，他的聲音可有點不堪入耳。可是他的姐姐妹妹們並不反對地唱，有時侯還要跟他一起唱，這眞是一個快樂的音樂之家。</p>
<p>可是慢慢的，那二女兒的興緻轉到旁處去了，她開始熟戀了。她把唱歌的時間省下來，寫情書，或者陪着她情人說話。於是這家裏繼續彈唱不輟的，就只剩了那個小女兒，她對於唱歌，比她姐姐更有恒心；她不僅是唱着玩，還把它當作一件正經事來作；她不僅要學某女高音，還要學許多旁的歌星。可惜她家境不十分好，她的哥哥姐姐都在外面做事，而她就必須帮助她母親料理家務；但剩下來的時間，她決不放鬆，全部用在唱歌上。雖然她年紀還小，唱出來不免稚氣，可是她身體肥胖，嗓音却異常圓潤。此外還有一個好處，就是她出落得一天比一天美。當然這種美也不過是毛孩子式的美，但她的前途決不暗淡，因此她心裏非常快活。每天興抖抖的把她的份內事作好以後，就開始自彈自唱，有時候唱累了，也到外面來種種花，修修花國；可是弄不了一會，就又突然想起了什麼要緊事似的，跑到房裏去，拿起了她的唱歌書，於是零亂的琴聲，和她嘹亮的歌聲，就又重新開始了。</p>
<p>這樣年復一年，她的歌唱得很有進步了，而她姐姐的歌却成了絕響。沒有多久，她姐姐嫁了；出嫁以後把鋼琴也一起帶走，於是這個小女兒，就只好以紅牙拍板來代替鋼琴。有時候她也到她姐姐家裏去，她去的目的，倒不是去看她姐姐，而是去看那隻鋼琴。他現在已經有十七八歲模樣了，長得新群，活潑，而且在一般人看來，總不免稱贊她美的。只有一個缺點，就是她不能像她二姐一樣，出類拔萃長得高一點。她的身長大概還不到四尺，而她又正當發育的年齡，不能往高裏穿，只好往橫裏長，因此她一天比一天胖。幸而一般人所注意的，往往只是一張臉兒，只要臉兒長得美，旁的也就不去苛求了。所以不管在勞人心目中，還是在她自己心目中，她都是屬於美人一類的。</p>
<p>也許就是這種美的自覺，給她創造了一個新境遇。她可以在家裏唱，爲什麼不可以到外邊去唱呢？長得不如她，唱得比她難聽的，還要去作歌星呢，她爲什麼倒不可以去作呢？其實她在私底下早就有這糧雄心了，幾年來苦苦學唱，無非是爲了這些，現在時機已經成熟了，她爲什麼不馬上就開始呢？不，她已經開始了，她每天穿着漂亮的衣服，打扮得花枝招展，去從事她的新職業，她出去得很晚，回來得更晚，她家裘多了一批新交遊，那都是些花綠錄的女孩。</p>
<p>可是她白天不出去，白天還是待在家裏唱，並且因爲她現在收入好一點，就買了一隻收音機，於是只要她在家的時候，沒有一分鐘一秒鐘，不是播送着流行歌曲；一個電合的節目播完，就換上另一個電臺。有時候她自己也和着一起唱，那歌聲就更加響　了。現在天氣煙來　　，沒有一家能不開　的，於是「優本痴情」，「是眞是假」，「我要你」這一類的哥　，就無孔不入，碰到有跳舞辦的人，眞不免要在他的斗　中翩翩起舞了。</p>
<p>有一天我正在看報紙，無寫中看到一幅咖啡館的廣吿，上面寫，「特請谷驚小姐客串獻唱」，我知道谷鷥不是她，因爲我看見過谷駕；可是我心裏不禁想，假如把谷駕這名字給了她，却有多末恰當啊！「乳鶯出谷」，正是她的一幅完美的寫照呢！</p>
<h3>草木烏獸之名</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>王筠詩：「霜被守宮槐，風驚護門草。」按常山有百靈草，取置戶下，或有非物過其門者，草輒叱之，因以爲名。守宮槐，見爾雅，其葉晝聶育炕。股堯藩詩：「驚將吉了語，猿共果然啼。」元微之詩：「果然皮勝錦，吉了舌如人」。按「吉了」，狀如　鵒，全體色黑，兩眼後有黃肉冠，脚黃嘴赤，能效人言。「果然」，天中記云：似獼猴，自呼其名。陸龜蒙詩：「行歇每依烏舅影，挑頻時見鼠姑心。』按「烏舅」，　　鳥也，亦名批頰，又名山呼。「鼠姑」，乃牧丹之別名，見本草。今之偶識草本鳥獸之名者，恐不能道此也。</p>
<h3>杜鵑</h3>
<p>— 任微音</p>
<p>杜鵑是殘酷的，</p>
<p>它是遲暮的裝飾。</p>
<p>但公平的上帝，杜鵑是無辜的！</p>
<p>因爲沒有它，這悲哀依然存在。</p>
<p>山林凄密，榴花已熄滅了是後的餘紅，這是杜鵑泣血的時候，詩人說；這是人生之網濾淨出來的悲哀。我不懂得這黑羽的小生物對宇宙的感想何似，但這一掬凄凉，這無吿底惆悵我是感染着了</p>
<p>從來就怕見歸宿的字眼，歸宿是一切的結束；連同流浪者日暮天寒美麗的寂悒。我愛吉普賽人的性格，愛那音樂的民族，當炊火在草莽中燃起，當明天之門還沒有打開，那未來之謎不是最動人的麼？杜鵑！今夜我失眠的聽覺中又傳來你的呼喚，你是爲了明朝而嘆息，還是爲過去而悵望，當黃沙下古戰士都枕干靜眠了，你難道還不禁對長空放任的暇想，你愛着望帝的靈魂麼（註一），你還是懷念起古代的美人江山。</p>
<p>啊，杜鵑！從來只有智慧者的悲憤，只有情死者的長眠，也許你懂得功成身退的滋味，而你却願投身洪流，化成闊展的雙翼翱翔世間（註二），但是，人生只是一杯苦酒，你只能有一次乾杯，這乾杯之後就帶來朝朝暮暮你的怨訴麼？不　杜鵑，我知道這怨訴是季節的結束，是人們苦悶的徵象，而却是你一切的開始。</p>
<p>今夜，我獨自徘徊在寂靜的簷下，你的啼聲又越離而來了。長空此時沒有一點光亮，星月的白輝此時都閃灼在濃厚的烏雲外了；我無法縮短空間的遙遠里程，拔提你皮囊到天外；然而天外交輝的星月，彷彿在我心上明亮。雖然眼前是一片邃黑，那山林的濃排，’已含　夜　露昇起。</p>
<p>何處是供荒的邊椽？個寫　塵史的開始？何處是　　　　　，　草，美人？何麗是　巨，　子，名王，名將？杜鵑！實　下堆着歷史的陳續，那陳臘裏　　着　　和白骨；骷髏和白骨　　遠有你的嘆息，一杯苦　只有一次乾杯，這一次乾杯後，便邊　什麼可爲你挽轉。</p>
<p>啊！那橫水的源頭，　山的極頂，無論是高空或深海，比時都隨渾圓在轉向。造物沒有引　地底的烈火，驅逐空中的嚴　　；　但是透過遠古到無人的世紀，郵氷山曾凍熄了烈水，烈火也灼　了海洋。沒有一個詩人，沒有一個英雄曾經這樣想過。杜鵑！你可是覺得人類太渺小麼？因此，我懂得了你的怨訴，你充滿力量的浩嘆；</p>
<p>但這浩嘆只是無譜的音樂，像一個勞者的幻夢，醒來只留得做都印象。我不知道鄒　與愚之　　　多　，　　　的距　問，便注定了你織賺的命逐。你是一個悲哥的詩人，你哥唱季節的老　，你露渺小的人類燃起感　。</p>
<p>巴山夜兩，厦　已散去濃　的花香。青絨饑自的總　已寂然中　；　命的詩人意欲何爲？隔簡　　　來你　個的哀喚。</p>
<p>註一：「華陽國志」：蜀相開明，傾慕杜宇皇后美麗，竟弒望帝奪其后，望帝怨　不散，入靑城山化爲異禽，是乃杜閱，又號杜宇。李義山「　帝春心託杜　」句即指此。</p>
<p>註二：李冰治水，開濬氓沱兩江，成川省水利。功甫成，李冰投於水，化爲杜鵑。見「靑城山記」，又蜀人傳花蕊夫人化爲杜鵑者。</p>
<h3>聽蟬小集</h3>
<p>— 老凱</p>
<p>蟬</p>
<p>蟬，代表了光明的夏天底來到，蛻變着古老的絳黃的外衣，而且是那麼有力的健康的象徽呵</p>
<p>它蹲踞在碧綠的高枝，俯廠擾攘的塵世，脾睨一切。它爲了不層與世俗浮沉，寧于餐風飲露，澹泊一生。</p>
<p>當曉風殘月的黎明，它最先覺醒。當黃昏悄然從峯　落下，它悠閑地唱着歌。</p>
<p>它的歌是如此之聒耳，呌那些爭名逐臭的人聽了，就沒有不感到惶惑而煩躁。</p>
<p>然而，這位高潔的隱士，却永遠睜着一雙固執的眼睛，並不因爲別人的厭惡，而輕于停輟了自己的歌唱。</p>
<p>它歌唱，當陽光晒得發白的炎午，也不感到一點熱的威脅和一絲倦意。</p>
<p>壞孩子擎着竹竽向它走來，「生于塵土，死于塵土。」便是現成的它底輓詩。</p>
<p>流星</p>
<p>夏夜，時可看流星穿過我的窗外，穿過廣漢底平原。</p>
<p>流星，像是希望的火花一閃即逝；又像是多情的少女在拉長了相思的淚線。</p>
<p>小時候，我往往想從它得到什麼解釋，然而不能。我曾經把它當作一種生了尾巴的飛螢。</p>
<p>我愛它在死一般的暗夜裏，終于有着一瞬間的閃耀；終于燒燃起生命的光燄。</p>
<p>夏天的雲</p>
<p>劉是美麗的，夏天的雲尤其是美麗的。</p>
<p>有人說：雲，就是彩色編織成的幻想；雲就是穠豐的詩。</p>
<p>伸展在我的窗外的：有高而奇怪的天空，有縹浮着的各種各樣的雲，這些雲一會兒是桃色的，俳色的，一會兒又是乳白色的，鉛色的。它的踪迹，也頗難捉摸：此方，它有時一倒掛在林端，像一面酒旂，有時橫臥在山腰，像一條巨大的白蟒；有時却又蕩　于碧藍的天海，而使人想起古老的明凈的風帆。</p>
<p>在庸俗的忙碌中，或在寂寞的閒逸中，偶然抽暇看一回雲，也許不是全無意義的事吧？</p>
<h3>人像　（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 胡金人</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　348</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>籤是上上大吉，殺刦重重。却只主張掃蕩妖魔，不主張報仇。因這籤的指導，鼎元也回復到原有的主張；如其報一家私仇，不如留着有用之身，替國家雪恥。他覺得老道雖知識有限，却是一個有心人，便同老道計劃怎樣誅魔。老道本來勸鼎元「矯裝打扮，改充老道，也可免得妖魔見疑，一無奈鼎元沒有長頭髮，不能混充老道；索性難光了頭，做一個臨時佛門弟子。老道說，一很好，釋道一家，當日三淸老爺常眼如來佛來往，佛門裏的準提，接引。慈航，都是道敎出身。……」鼎元臨走，老道把從鼎元身上搜出的手槍，也還給鼎元，並且答應按天給他燒一注香，求三淸太上老君，和蕩魔二郞神默佑，掃蕩妖　。</p>
<p>鼎元的化裝，很合倭鬼的胃口。數度接觸之後，倭軍居然請鼎元替日本戰死的「　軍」唪經；因他們的「御僧侶」這時沒有隨軍出征。倭特務隊也逐漸聯絡鼎元，利用他探聽些零碎消息……</p>
<p>「這是我的小小經過，」鼎元吿訴我；「倒是混得不錯……我很能捏造情報，只苦於無法把鬼子的行動，透給我們自己的軍隊……我在鬼子限制的範圍內，也竭力活動過。……</p>
<p>一直到前天晚上，忽然探到日本特工，在昌平這裏，捉獲了幾個「抗日份子』，我才毅法跟他們發生關係。他們呌我留意外面活動的其他同志，共有好幾十人，特別留心他們的首領，一位二十幾歲的大姑娘，也許走這昌平路過。……</p>
<p>「當晚，我無意碰見了紀耀羣小姐，她扮的男裝。本來我也不認得她，倒是她瞧出了我的僞裝破綻，一口喊出我的名字……」　我一聽見耀羣眞的也在這裏，便截住鼎元的話、問他能不能把龍羣找來，或是我們去找她。</p>
<p>「今天不成」，鼎元嘆了一口氣，「要成的話，剛才碰見孫隊長（〇四）早就把紀小姐邀過來了……」</p>
<p>「怎麼說？」我聽見鼎元嘆氣，害怕耀舉也給倭特捉去了。</p>
<p>「倒不用着急，」鼎元搶着安　我：「只是她太胆大：她昨天晚上就上隻義橋去了……」</p>
<p>「去作什麼呢？」我不由也躭蒲心事地驚嘆着。</p>
<p>「佈置行動，大概關係這裏被捉的幾位同志，救他們脫險。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼上變義橋？…這橋在哪裏」？我似乎失去了理智，這般逼着鼎元問。</p>
<p>「隻義橋就在戰外七八里地額南，離沙河縣西言口不多遠，是日　特　的大本營……」</p>
<p>「　爲什麼　臉跑　魔　　　　　呢？」我問着自己；又　着　　問題？「她是一個人，　　另有帮手，——意虎城那個擾子？……」</p>

<h3>再談房租</h3>
<p>— 十</p>
<p>欣聞市府已正式與各方會會本市房粗問　，因爲這有關全上海人的生活吳　　，我們不得不希望市府此次能以「快刀斬藏」的手腕，一舉簡解決勝利以來，迄今無法解決的　案。</p>
<p>上海人口稠密，比戰前增加許多，那是事貿；政府機關集中鬧區，辦公人員不得不做布在市中心，這也是事實；上海四郊軍隊單位增多，他們要求住屋，也是事實；上海軍輛激增，各種軍輛總數達廿一萬輛，致平民區住屋也達到飽和狀態，這也是事實；由於這些因素，（加之物價波動，黃金美鈔黑市扶搖直上）都能造成上海房租的畸形狀態。</p>
<p>上海空麗多得很，高機大厦、穿　着的也比比皆是，他們要的要是　子，美鈔，和　　　幣，有　的人，算拆息，不順意頂房子；沒有金條獎鈔的人，沒有辦法頂　子。於是造成；有房子沒有人住，沒有房子的人不知擠柱那裏去？</p>
<p>我們要求市府，把這些空聞的高樓大厦打開來，把那些用金條美鈔對閉的空　打開來！訂定公平無私的租賃條例，讓上海恢復到戰前的租賃狀態！</p>
<p>正像市府與黑市金鈔作數戰一樣，房租問題，也將必須派出大批稽查人員，用迅雷不及掩耳的手腕，張制那些一空屋打開來，必要時，鼓勵市民密吿，通盤調查全上海的餘屋，使他們能够合法的出租。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從鐵錨歸國：憶甲午中日海戰</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>繼錨鍊及砲彈由飛星輪帶返祖國後，鐵錨兩具亦隨隆順輪歸國。當我們看到了丈長的鐵錨時，猶可想見當年鐵錨母體鎭遠號戰艦之雄姿。五十年來，錨彈在日本日比野公園，被作爲戰利品陳列着，在勝利後幾度交涉，終返祖國，我人目睹此物，能不感慨系之。</p>
<p>回憶甲午前，全國海軍總噸數達十四萬五千九百噸之多，若除去內河艦隻，亦有八萬五千噸，比日本所有的五萬九千噸，尙超過十分之四，光緒十七年，丁汝昌曾率戰艦巡洋艦六艘，東巡日本。後二年，李鴻章在咸海衛大閱海軍，艦隊聲勢之盛，日本全國震動而惶恐備戰。然未幾而甲午一戰，中國戰敗，弱點全露，海軍更全軍覆沒，其故安在？</p>
<p>昔人嘗論及我海軍而感嘆無用，實則未透說彼時環境形勢及作戰經過也。甲午海戰有黃海之主力會戰及旅順，威海衛的兩次保衛戰。蘇聯史家曾評斷威海衛軍戰中「中國軍隊表現了確實的英勇」。豐島戰後，失去朝群海海權。黃海戰役則有比以歐戰時日德蘭的英德大海戰，後以旅順威海衛保衛戰中陸軍棄守要塞，遂迫成艦隊之慘運。以黃海戰役而言，敵艦計十二艘共三萬九千四百八十七噸，我丁提督統北洋艦隊九戰艦及廣甲一艦等，　三萬一千三百四十五噸，實力已差。鎮遠號時衛護丁汝昌之旗艦定遠號，十二吋砲彈打盡，甲板被創極重，三副陳亡，大副全身浴血而督戰，員兵死傷甚衆。該艦在威海衛戰役中力戰而被俘，然新艦長楊用霖口銜手槍自殺，死跡殊慘烈。故鐵錨之歸，由於過去之戰史，亦無愧於祖國。因我軍艦速力低，大砲舊且少，護甲薄弱，質之比較相差雖大，但仍能力戰拒敵。然究其敗因，尙不僅於此。</p>
<p>我們檢討甲午海戰歷史，得到幾點敎訓：第一，是政府腐敗自傲而不　海備。如李鴻章力請於朝，欲購軍艦及快砲，均爲其政敵及非戰論者所阻，如翁同籢等以「日本豈眞敢犯我上國哉，北洋之所豫備，已足破日本之胆，逆料其必不渡海遠來」。在朝之土大夫輕敵自傲，不明時勢，輕忽海防，尤以軍艦用費二千萬兩移修頤和園，添艦購砲均無望。以多數之簡陋本艦以當朝野一致修建之日本新銳之艦，如何言戰？第二是軍紀不整，當時將領食汚及尅扣軍餉，砲含之砲竟有不堪一放者，購砲的人但求七折八扣，不問可用；威海衛砲台守將壓餉三月，戰時移運家中，各艦應發餉物，亦有包辦及扣發弊實；且軍械所職員竟爲間牒，出賣中國海重砲械兵數淸單及運兵輪情報。第三是軍政軍令不統一，陸海軍不協同作戰。李鴻章統北洋海軍，曾國荃統南洋海軍，閩粵海軍等也各自管轄，各不相涉，海軍衙門旣無統率之權，提督丁汝昌則不能指揮全國艦隊，（其本人爲陸將出身），統帥無人，焉得不敗？而陸海軍亦無協同計劃統籌作戰，作戰而無統籌戰略與統一指揮，敗象已顯。如砲合竟歸陸軍節制，砲台疏忽，港防空虛，海軍聯絡無效，處處被迫居劣勢地位。李鴻章雖屬有心人，但戰前戰時均未能且不可能統盤有效策劃。軍備不修，軍令不一，自難操勝算。</p>
<p>回顧過去敎訓，當此建軍時候，正是所著力改革者。但我海防　　　，海防仍不是以言堅固，　須努力。何况目今日本正　東山再起，最近要帥准許日本肱立捕　隊，並得往南極捕鯨，中開海捕魚，則寫”本未來雞立醫隊陰謀的預圖，應予警戒。我國應和澳洲同一立塲，堅決反育才是。</p>
<h3>勞勃泰勒與拉透透納在「雙雄喋血」中</h3>
<h3>德國的失策之一</h3>
<p>— 顧斌</p>
<p>英國的科學家們，在協助他們的海軍，　得對德的潛艇戰之點上，確實擔任過一個重要的角色，而且時時刻刻逼得敵人不得不常常改變他的戰術。</p>
<p>據有關方面透露消息稱，一九四四年的春初，德國海軍上將杜尼茲，在威馬爾城曾經對德國的海軍將校舉行過一次含有「打氣作用」的談話，其中有一段關於評論到英國的科學，尤其是提到「無綫電定位儀（Radiolocaron）的措辭，說得饒有趣味似的。他說：「在去年的年終和今年的年初，敵人方面（指英方）有一件事情的發展很顯然地使我們感到憂懼的，永遠地會感到憂懼的，那就是敵人利用了無綫電定位儀來剝奪我們潛艇的非常重要的特質——它的使人驚愕的成分。現在他們用了這種法則已經逐漸克服了我們潛艇所給予他們的威脅。」</p>
<p>杜尼茲接　　　　　　發明無綫電定位儀的科學家，曾經被奉為他們國家的救星。可見得使人在潛艇方面得到成功的，並不是什麼優越的戰略或戰衛。而實在是由於科學研究上的優越性使然的。</p>
<p>「德國把她的非常寳貴的科學家們抽去，呌他們到武裝部隊中去服着兵役，而不讓他們繼續去從事科學的研究，直到過了八個月的冗長的時期以後，最高當局才始下令讓他們免役而呌他們重新再回到實驗室裏去工作。我們應該承認，我們已經鑄成了一個大錯了。」</p>
<p>然而英國當局却並沒有犯過這樣重大的錯誤。恰巧相反，自從戰事一發生，他們馬上指導他們的科學家，不論在武裝部隊以內和以外的人員，都趕緊從事科學上的研究。具體些說，海軍部就麗用了三千開外的科學家，在他們的各個實騐室裏和各處署中埋頭研究着，所以他們比了任何那一個國家裏的科學家要略　一籌的。並且他們還被羅致於新組成的「英國皇家海軍科學研究所」裏，給予極優厚的月俸。</p>
<p>從這點上我們可以知道，英國海軍在世界裏還是第一個認淸不拘在戰時和平時都要維持科學研究工作重要性的一個，於是它首先創辦了這樣一個特殊的羅致各種各樣如熟悉磁性水雷（Magnetie　mine）發明電警器（hymophone）等等人才的研究所。</p>

<p>這裏，把學官的嘴臉，結結實實的勾出來了了吏的「笑」，宰夫的「岸然」，可謂俱臻妙絕，抵得一部「官塲現形記」。「衙門八字開，無錢莫進來」，有了錢，小羔可以變成「碩大」，腐朽可以化爲神奇，一則又豈止、「可通神」·而已哉！</p>

<h3>The National Economic Commission Passes Draft: Officials and Citizens to Practice Thrift; Economic Control Measures Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The draft of measures for practicing thrift and reducing consumption was passed by the National Economic Commission on the 17th. The original draft was quite cumbersome.

(9) Set paper-saving standards for the publishing industry and strictly enforce them. (10) Extend the months applicable to summer time. (11) Implement a be-on-time movement. It was also heard that the meeting also discussed the matter of banning dancing.</p>
<p>Economic Reform Plan to be Submitted to the Government</p>
<p>Today's meeting was chaired by President Zhang. The main cases discussed are recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the Economic Reform Plan, it was resolved to task the Comprehensive Sub-Group with completing the sorting work within this week, submitting it to the general meeting next Monday for submission to the Executive Yuan, and then to the State Council. (2) Regarding the originally planned Urban Economic Control Measures, most committee members believed during the discussion that these measures were largely similar to the economic emergency measures and did not need to be formulated separately. Some also believed that they could be supplemented. It was resolved to submit them to the Ministry of Finance and other departments for review, selecting the more innovative ones, but the name will be changed. (3) The Draft Outline for Practicing Thrift and Reducing Consumption was revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan. (4) The Food Production Increase Plan submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture was submitted to Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, and others for review. (5) The Principle of the Regulations on the Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans by the Banking Industry was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan. (6) The Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Adjustment Measures, restoring the wartime cotton, yarn, and cloth control measures, using cotton to exchange for yarn, and yarn to exchange for cloth, to be handled by the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee without establishing another institution. That case...</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The 348th board meeting of the Four Joint Offices was held at 9:00 AM on the 17th, presided over by Vice Chairman Zhang Qun. Board members Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Xu Kan, and Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan, among others, attended. In addition to approving over one hundred loan cases, the office, in view of the government's implementation of general mobilization, stipulated six items of "Principles for Coordinating the Implementation of Business Affairs of National Banks and Bureaus with General Mobilization," requiring that all banks and bureaus should expedite the absorption of idle funds, control of credit, assistance to production, facilitation of transport and marketing, and adjustment of branch institutions and tight expenditure in the future. After detailed discussion by the board members, the chairman appointed Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, and Xu Baiyuan to review them, and attached a proposed implementation plan. (Note: The section on the tea purchasing deadline from the Four Joint Offices meeting can be found on page 6.)</p>
<p>Repayment of Pre-War Deposits Principle Already Passed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Regulations on the Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans by the Banking Industry, which has attracted attention from all parties, was principally approved by the National Economic Commission on the 17th and will be sent to the Executive Yuan. Because it concerns the interests of the people, it may be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The explanation of "pre-war" in the regulations is "before the declaration of war against Japan on December 9, 1941." There are two reasons for this interpretation: (1) China formally declared war against Japan on this day, (2) Prices were relatively stable before this date. It is heard that the principal and interest of deposits made from July 7, 1937, to September 3, 1945, until September 2, 1947, are as follows (the annual interest rate is calculated at the monthly interest rate compounded monthly): July 7 to December 31, 1937 (925.164), 1938 (858.714), 1939 (740.667), 1940 (620.951), 1941 (493.666), 1942 (366.639), 1943 (237.079), 1944 (112.414), January 1, 1945 onwards (46.661), September 3, 1945 onwards (20.358). However, the above is only a principle, and the calculation will be based on the date of promulgation of the law in the future.</p>
<h3>Increase Food Production Outline Drafted</h3>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng Submitted to the National Economic Commission</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] In order to increase food production, enrich military supplies and civilian food, and reduce food imports, especially focusing on food supply in food-deficient cities, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in the third year, Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng submitted to the National Economic Commission a "Draft Outline for a Food Production Increase Plan." The plan is divided into nine major categories. The work target is to increase rice by 20 million dan, wheat by 12 million dan, corn by 5 million dan, sorghum by 1.5 million dan, millet by 5.6 million dan, sweet potatoes by 4.1 million dan, potatoes by 2.7 million dan, soybeans by 2.5 million dan, and vegetables by 5 million dan by the end of the third year. The estimated cost until the end of 1947 is approximately 40 billion yuan for start-up costs and business expenses, with approximately 10 billion yuan needed for next year. In the plan, he pointed out that food-deficient areas are mostly densely populated areas and large cities, including: (1) Jinghu [Nanjing-Shanghai], (2) Hangyong [Hangzhou-Ningbo], (3) Rongshan [Fuzhou-Shantou], (4) Sui [Guangzhou], (5) Pingjin [Beijing-Tianjin], (6) Jiaoji [Jiaozhou-Jinan] six locations. Possible food supply areas include: (1) Su-Zhe-Wan [Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui], (2) Xiang-E-Gan [Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi], (3) Min-Tai [Fujian-Taiwan], (4) Chuan [Sichuan], (5) Liangyue [Guangdong-Guangxi], (6) Yu-Shaan-Ning [Henan-Shaanxi-Ningxia], (7) Ji-Lu-Sui [Hebei-Shandong-Suiyuan], (8) Liao-Ji [Liaoning-Jilin] eight locations. Production increase work should be carried out separately in each production and supply area. Central strongholds should be selected in each area to establish supervision institutions, and subsidiary strongholds should be designated according to the distribution of various food crops in the area to establish work institutions. Work items are divided into (1) exchanging for improved varieties, (2) applying fertilizer, (3) improving cultivation methods, (4) preventing and controlling diseases and pests, (5) increasing acreage, (6) improving storage, transportation, and processing. The case was slightly discussed at the meeting and handed over to Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, and Wang Yunwu for review, to be discussed at the next general meeting.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Handwritten Instruction to the Ministry of Agriculture to Launch a Comprehensive Afforestation Campaign</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] It is learned that Chairman Chiang recently instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in his own handwriting, stating that the outskirts of Nanjing, the Western Hills of Beiping, and Mount Song in Henan should be used as afforestation demonstration areas, launching a ten-year comprehensive afforestation campaign, to be completed within ten years from 1947, and allocated 600 million yuan for afforestation expenses, hoping that after ten years, all mountains will have trees and all trees will provide shade.

<h3>All Groups Participating in the Election Should First Report a List of Names</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The organization of people's groups in various places has been proceeding very rapidly recently, and some people think this has something to do with occupational elections. On the 16th, our reporter paid a special visit to Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang to inquire whether there were any regulations regarding the deadline for the establishment of occupational groups participating in the election. He replied: Guiding the organization of people's groups is a routine task of the Ministry. All applications to initiate the organization of groups in accordance with the law can be approved for establishment at any time. As for occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election, according to Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives and Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members, a list of names should be reported 90 days before the election. Therefore, all groups legally established before the 90-day deadline for this year's general election should report their lists and enjoy the right to vote. Those established after this deadline cannot participate in the election, but this does not affect the progress of their group organization.</p>
<h3>Bevin Delivers Speech Focuses on the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: Bevin delivered a speech to British transport workers today. He stated that although the Far East is extremely remote from Britain, its current potential crisis for Britain is no smaller than that of Europe. He deeply hopes that the British people will not neglect the Far East. Bevin also said: "Some people point out that I have divided Europe into two, and say that Britain's acceptance of the Marshall Plan is tantamount to creating a second Munich. These statements are all inaccurate. In the past two years, I have been working continuously to prevent the division of Europe. The United States has made great contributions to victory, and I believe that the United States should use its enormous production capacity to work for peace. Britain's acceptance of the Marshall Plan will definitely not make it a vassal of the United States." Finally, Bevin, in a very somber tone, emphasized every word, saying: "The whole world has tasted the pain of war. Neither we, the United States, France, nor the Soviet Union need another war. But we must proceed cautiously, otherwise it is unimaginable. I will never identify a certain country as a possible enemy and implement policies based on this assumption. What I value is not the atomic bomb, but the lasting peace of Europe and the whole world."</p>

<h3>Two-Thirds of Railways in South China Recovered</h3>
<p>The American Writer's Claims Are Not True</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Recently, some American writers have claimed that although there are no Communist bandits in South China, the Chinese government has not taken any action to repair the railways in the area. This statement is absolutely not true. According to information from the Ministry of Communications released by Director of the News Bureau Dong XianGuang, the situation of railway repair in South China is as follows: During the Anti-Japanese War, the railway lines in South China were most thoroughly destroyed due to changes in the military situation. Currently, of the original 3,507 kilometers of railways in South China, 2,227 kilometers have been repaired and opened to traffic, about two-thirds.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the National Assembly Hall Requires Over 20 Billion; the Executive Yuan Is Considering It Carefully</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The overall cost of the reconstruction project of the National Assembly Hall, jointly estimated by the General Political Department, the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, and the Fu Ji Construction Company, based on both reconstruction and new construction projects, is approximately as follows: (1) The reconstruction part, demolishing the rear of the original hall and increasing the number of seats, would cost approximately 21.49112 billion National Currency and require 150 working days. (2) The new construction part, based on the draft of the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, is estimated to cost approximately 22.3553875 billion National Currency (if some boilers are delayed and the chairs are changed to gauze fabric, it can be reduced by 6.96 billion National Currency) and requires approximately 180 working days. Furthermore, it is heard that an additional three months are needed for drawing. The above plans are all to accommodate the existing hall for reconstruction. According to people in charge of the project, if the existing hall is extended backward towards the pond, the soil firmness and slackness in front and back would be too different, and the entire structure would not be balanced, and there would be a place of collapse, and the number of seats added after the expansion would still be 200 seats short of what is needed, and the back row seats would be too far from the podium. This point should be noted. The above project and funding issues are all being carefully considered by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>If the Korean Problem Is Resolved, the Situation in China Can Be Clarified; An Authoritative Figure Discusses Wedemeyer's Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] An authoritative figure said that General Wedemeyer's visit to the Far East and Korea is one of his major objectives. Some people have incorrectly assumed that the US is inappropriately comparing our country, a major victorious power, with Korea, which is under Allied control. In fact, the current situation in Korea is far worse than in our country. For 20 months, Korea has been the direct point of contention between US and Soviet policy, with sharp conflicts occurring at any time. Therefore, the United States attaches great importance to it. Moreover, from our country's point of view, if the Korean problem can be resolved, the Chinese problem will naturally be solved. In international relations, the key to the problem lies in the situation and the facts. We should not ignore it because of the status of the nation.</p>
<p>The Current Situation in Korea Koreans Express Deep Indignation</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Our reporter visited Pu Chun, head of the Korean Provisional Government's delegation in China, on the 17th. He said that the delegation is drafting a memorandum with information on Korea's recent situation, to be submitted to General Wedemeyer. He said that nearly two years after Japan's surrender, Korea's situation is getting worse and worse. In the north, Korean Communists, under the protection of the Soviet army, are becoming more and more powerful. Wealth is destroyed, and people are struggling to survive. In the south, prices are soaring, the number of refugees is increasing, and bureaucrats from financial groups and compradors are colluding. In addition, Korean Communists are infiltrating and engaging in activities. Politics is lacking in achievements, and society lacks stability. The Korean people are deeply indignant about their innocent fate being sacrificed in the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. He emphasized that if a thorough peace negotiation is not achieved between the US and the Soviet Union, the establishment of a coalition government will turn South Korea into a second North Korea, and 300,000 armed Korean Communists will encompass the Korean peninsula, endangering the entire Far East peace. This is the unanimous view of Korean revolutionary democrats, and it is hoped that General Wedemeyer's party will value the suffering of the Korean people and change the US Far East policy.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer's Mission in China Is Purely to Assist the Government</h3>
<p>Washington Figure Speaks</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] According to well-informed sources, although General Wedemeyer is similar to Marshal Marshall's special envoy to President Truman last year, his mission is completely different from Marshal Marshall's. Marshal Marshall's mission was to find a way to mediate the domestic conflict in that country, while General Wedemeyer's purpose is to provide the Chinese government with all possible assistance from the United States to oppose the Communist Party. The US assistance to China will likely consist of supplying China with military equipment and ammunition, and the $500 million loan that the Export-Import Bank has allocated but not released may also be loaned to China. The terms of the loan are likely to be the same as those for the loan to Greece, because the domestic situations in China and Greece are quite similar. As for General Wedemeyer's visit to Korea, he also has an important mission to decide whether the United States should continue negotiations with the Soviet government in Seoul or whether the United States should unilaterally organize a provisional government in the US-occupied area.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] The World Telegram commented on Wedemeyer's visit to China, saying: "The current situation in China is largely created by the United States, because Roosevelt's policy of trusting the CCP and the Soviet Union has led to today's situation where most of Manchuria and Korea have fallen into the hands of the CCP and the Soviet Union. Wedemeyer's visit to China is a prerequisite for our adoption of a constructive policy towards China to replace a hesitant policy."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] General Wedemeyer, accompanied by five advisors, boarded an army plane this morning to Nanjing. Those who went to the airport to see him off included State Department officials and some Chinese officials, including Gu Weijun, Tang Shaohua, and Huang Renlin.</p>
<h3>Mission Completed in China, Wedemeyer May Go to Japan</h3>
<p>Meeting with MacArthur</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] According to headquarters sources, the rumor that Wedemeyer will stay in Tokyo briefly on his way from Washington to China is not true. Wedemeyer may come here after completing his mission in China to meet with MacArthur. If he comes here, he will reside at his friend, Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger's residence. It is heard that Wedemeyer and ten staff members took off from Washington on a (C.45) aircraft and arrived in Guam on the 21st and Nanjing on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Mongolian Troops Invading the Sui Border; Capital Officials Have Not Received Formal Reports; Xinjiang Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Enlist Rebels</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] It is learned that after invading Xinjiang, Outer Mongolian troops have also infiltrated Tugulik on the northern border of Suiyuan, stationed in Island Lan Tuo Luohai, and established a border defense command. They are also conducting live ammunition exercises for infantry and artillery units within Chinese territory. Nanjing officials have not yet confirmed this. Director of the News Bureau Dong XianGuang and the spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense both said that they have not received formal reports.</p>
<p>[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 17th] On June 26, an unidentified plane was discovered in the northeast of the Fourth Son of the Banner to Reconnoiter. From 1:00 to 2:00 PM on July 1, there was an unidentified...</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Dihua, 16th] Nationalist Army authorities today accused the rebels of attacking the highway from Dihua to other provinces of China last week. This was instigated by rebel leader Achi Maqiang to facilitate Achi's demands that the Nationalist Army withdraw from Xinjiang and replace Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Maswood. In a battle near Turpan, 120 rebels were killed, and the Nationalist Army suffered minor losses. Villages near Turpan were also attacked. Merchants were robbed and goods destroyed on the KashiGhar Road. In this battle, 500 rebels fought fiercely with the provincial army escorting the merchants. The provincial government has sent several representatives to the rebel areas to enlist them.</p>
<h3>The War in Western Shandong Becomes More Tragic: Communist Forces' Main Force Harasses the Outskirts of Yanzhou</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Linshui, 17th] After losing their main base in the Yimeng Mountain area, the Communist forces in Shandong are becoming increasingly ferocious in their last-ditch struggle, and their movements are becoming more erratic. According to reports, except for the Sixth Column which is still in Zibo and Boshan, and the Second Column in Juxian and the area east of Yishui, the remaining eight columns under Chen Yi have again scattered to the Culai Mountain and the outskirts of Yanzhou, where they are engaged in fierce battles with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] The war in western Shandong is becoming increasingly tragic, and the fighting has spread to the outskirts of Yanzhou. The Communist Tenth Column, originally in Tai'an and Feicheng, has crossed the DaXiao River and split into two groups to harass Ningyang and Yanzhou. At the same time, the Seventh and Ninth Columns, which retreated to Culai Mountain, besides sending a detachment to probe Sishui, their main force is also taking advantage of the mountainous terrain east of the Jinpu Railway to launch harassing attacks on the outskirts of Yanzhou. The fighting was still intense as of the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] Three thousand Communist soldiers in the Anjiazhuang area north of the Dawen River crossed the Jinpu Railway east on the morning of the 17th, and the Eighth Column in Culai Mountain also showed signs of moving south. The original pontoon bridge at Dawenkou has been destroyed by floods, and the highway north of Dawenkou to Wandesh south has been severely damaged by the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] The National Army, advancing rapidly from Tai'an towards Dawenkou, captured Zhaozhuang and Hongdongdian on the 15th, and continued to eliminate more than 1,000 Communist troops from the Second Police Brigade east of Tai'an on the 16th. On the 17th, they had already pressed close to the suburbs of Dawenkou.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] The National Army has voluntarily abandoned Juye and Jiaxiang, and the fighting has shifted to the area of Jining and Ningyang. The fighting around Yangshanji, 25 li north of Jining Jinxiang, is still very fierce. A strong unit of the National Army broke through the encirclement before noon on the 17th and made contact with the National Army besieged at Yangshanji. The fighting was still intensifying as of the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] The National Army has voluntarily abandoned Juye and Jiaxiang, and the fighting has shifted to the area of Jining and Ningyang, with the battle for Jining being the most tragic. In addition, the First and Fifth Columns of Chen Yi have been besieging Tengxian and Zou County for days, also quite fiercely. The Communist forces attacking Tengxian were repelled by the National Army on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] The battle for Tengxian is still fiercely underway. More than 20,000 Communist troops have been besieging Tengxian for three days and nights. On the 15th, more than 2,000 Communist troops once again stormed into the Beiyang Building in the city, but were driven back by the defending troops. In recent days, the defending troops have eliminated more than 5,000 Communist troops and captured more than 100. The National Army moving north from Lincheng and the National Army moving south from Zou County are fiercely attacking the Communist forces attacking Tengxian from both sides.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] A major battle is brewing in the Zulai Mountain area. 60,000 Communist troops from the Third, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Columns have scattered to the southeast of Tai'an, west of Xintai, and northeast of Ningyang. The National Army has now completed the encirclement and is ready to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The National Army in Sishui returned to the mountainous area north of the city on the morning of the 16th to search and suppress the enemy, eliminating a Communist battalion.</p>

<h3>Matters to be Discussed in the Japanese Peace Treaty: Our Side is Fully Prepared; China and France Can Accept the U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Zhang Yuan, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on the 17th: Our side is fully prepared for the various matters to be discussed in the Japanese peace treaty and can provide materials at any time for the reference of the eleven-nation meeting in Washington. As for specific demands, such as the quota for reparations, a clear decision on whether the current Japanese political system still needs to be reformed, and the discussion and re-discussion of the status of Ryukyu and Korea, the government is considering carefully, and if a decision is made, an announcement may be issued. Zhang believes that since the U.S.'s proposed meeting in Washington on August 19 is a preparatory meeting for the peace conference, focusing on technical issues of the peace treaty, the various points of the peace treaty's content will be broadly discussed, and will not cause too much suffering because of wanting to make decisions. Zhang declined to answer a reporter's question, "If the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the meeting, what attitude will we take?" However, judging from his other statement that our delegation to the meeting may be appointed from diplomats currently stationed in the United States, and other remarks, our country has in principle decided to accept the U.S. invitation.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] A diplomatic source said that if it were not for the deterioration of the domestic situation in Shandong and the Northeast, and the problems between China and the Soviet Union, China should have taken the initiative to invite negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty. The government is as anxious as the public opinion about the resolution of this long-pending Far East issue. Now that the U.S. has taken the initiative to issue the invitation, our side should put forward precise opinions to help the peace conference achieve success and lay the foundation for stability in the Far East.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that it is not convenient to express an opinion on the U.S. proposal to convene an eleven-nation conference in Washington on August 19 to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, and further study is needed.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. proposed today to convene a preliminary eleven-nation peace conference on Japan in Washington or San Francisco on August 19. China and France can accept it.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 16th] The U.S. State Department has accepted the explanation from the British Commonwealth that the date of August 19 for convening the eleven-nation peace conference on Japan is particularly inconvenient. It is expected that the U.S. will agree to postpone the date of discussion of the peace treaty to mid-September. The British Commonwealth was originally scheduled to convene a Commonwealth conference in Canberra on August 26 to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, which would conflict with the U.S. proposal to convene an eleven-nation conference on August 19. Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have informally informed the U.S. State Department of this intention, and India will follow suit.</p>
<p>[Reuters Manchester, 17th] The Manchester Guardian commented on the U.S. invitation to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, saying: The U.S. believes that in the current situation, holding a foreign ministers' conference would be difficult to succeed and would increase disputes with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has decided to abandon the principle of going through a foreign ministers' conference to deal with the Japanese peace treaty. This is a novel action, but it still requires the Soviet Union's agreement. Secretary of State Marshall certainly does not want to complete the Japanese peace treaty without the Soviet Union's participation.</p>
<h3>The U.S. is Determined to Disregard Soviet Opposition: Will Proceed as Planned Even If the Soviet Union Does Not Participate; The Date of the Preliminary Meeting May Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 17th] U.S. officials admitted on the 17th that the Soviet Union's refusal to give up its veto power and allow the eleven nations, rather than the four nations, to draft the Japanese peace treaty, will make Marshall's decision difficult. Most diplomats speculate that Marshall was prepared for "the expected danger" when he proposed convening a preliminary peace conference on Japan on August 19. They feel that Marshall knows that the Soviet Union will again reject the Far East plan, just as it rejected the Marshall Plan in European conferences. These diplomats believe that if necessary, Marshall will proceed with drafting the Japanese peace treaty without the Soviet Union's participation. He can gain enthusiastic support at home, especially in Congress, as well as the support of other countries invited to participate in the peace conference. Both sides believe that the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan too late, as a latecomer. Given the U.S.'s firm policy towards the Soviet Union, it is generally believed here that if the Soviet Union obstructs, Marshall will not cancel his plan for a treaty with Japan. His basic policy towards the Soviet Union is that once a decision is made on any part of foreign policy, he will not back down. But if the Soviet Union refuses to allow the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission to begin drafting a Japanese peace treaty in Washington, it is decided to proceed even if the Soviet Union does not participate. A major principle adopted as a result of this consequence is to separate the Allied nations from Japan. However, no one here wants to take this step, but both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have solemnly declared in the United Nations Declaration that they will never conclude a peace treaty separately. If the U.S. violates this oath, a certain party will exert strong pressure, but if necessary, even greater pressure will be placed on the other party that violates the oath. The other party will also argue that wartime oaths are broken more often than observed. U.S. officials are preparing to postpone the date of the preliminary peace conference on Japan by one month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Expresses Welcome: Tokyo Stock Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama refused to immediately criticize the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference on Japan in Washington on the 17th. Katayama said: The Japanese government has no immediate counter-proposal to put forward regarding this plan. However, Foreign Minister Ashida said: "Although I am not in a position to express my opinion at this time, any effort to accelerate the Japanese peace treaty is extremely welcome."</p>
<p>Allied Headquarters officials said: MacArthur is also not expected to issue an immediate critique. Sources in Japan believe that the U.S. initiative to accelerate the peace conference will have a great impact on encouraging Japan's hope for early independence. Japanese observers believe that the U.S. motion is related to the chaotic world situation, especially the deepening split between the U.S. and the Soviet bloc. They said: The U.S.'s recent motion to accelerate the treaty with Japan will inevitably have a major impact on Japan's feelings towards the U.S. and on the U.S. forming a front against the Communist bloc.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 17th] The Tokyo Stock Exchange heard the news that a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty was scheduled to be held, and all stocks rose by two to seven points, especially textile stocks. Prime Minister Katayama commented on this news, expressing extreme pleasure, and said that this conference would enable all Allied countries to become familiar with Japan's current situation before drafting a Japanese peace treaty. Foreign Minister Ashida said that every action taken to proceed with the Japanese peace treaty will be extremely welcome.</p>
<h3>Chief of the Allied Diplomatic Section: Acheson to Return to the U.S. Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Acheson, the U.S. representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan and chief of the Allied Headquarters' diplomatic section, will return to the U.S. in August. Observers here believe that this trip may be related to the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. However, Acheson denied having made any statements regarding this meeting, and said that he intends to return to the country once every six months to discuss any issues related to Japan with U.S. officials.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Yokohama Establish Trading Company</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 16th] According to the Japan Times, overseas Chinese in Tokyo and Yokohama have established Yongshun Trading Company, which is the first company formed by people from a third country under Japanese law in post-war Japan. The company's main business is foreign trade, with a capital of 195,000 yen. The company is managed by overseas Chinese who have lived in Japan for many years and have a certain status. It applied to the Japanese government for establishment in April of this year and was approved on June 30.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prohibition of Food Stalls Affects the Livelihood of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Requests Negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 17th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has learned that in an attempt to save food, the Japanese government has banned the opening of food stalls nationwide. As a result, more than 3,000 food stalls opened by overseas Chinese in Japan have been greatly affected, and a large number of overseas Chinese will be forced to lose their jobs and have no way to make a living. In order to protect the interests of our overseas Chinese, the Commission has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly transfer the matter to our delegation in Japan and file a negotiation with the Allied Headquarters to ensure the legal protection of food stalls run by Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Venue for Japanese Peace Conference: There is Disagreement Among the Nations</h3>
<p>U.S. Senator Suggests Seattle</p>
<p>[Our newspaper report] San Francisco, 17th broadcast: U.S. Democratic Senator Magnuson suggested to the State Department that there seems to be disagreement among the representatives of the victorious nations regarding the venue for the Japanese peace conference. MacArthur hopes to hold the meeting in Tokyo, but Britain does not agree. China advocates holding the meeting in Shanghai. A compromise solution may be to hold the meeting in Seattle, which seems more desirable.</p>
<h3>Second Lottery for Japanese Reparation Ships: China Gains More Than 8,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Including Two Destroyers and Six Destroyer Escorts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th] The second lottery for the 92 former Japanese warships allocated to China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was held this morning. China received two destroyers and six destroyer escorts, totaling 8,450 tons. The Chinese representative attending the lottery said: The ships allocated to China will be driven by Japanese sailors, and may leave here for Shanghai on the 26th of this month. Rear Admiral Griffin, commander of the U.S. Far East Naval Forces, who presided over the simple informal ceremony, announced: The third lottery will be held in a few weeks. Britain won three destroyers and five destroyer escorts today, totaling 8,910 tons. The tonnage obtained by the Soviet Union was the same as that of China, and the United States obtained 8,660 tons. Griffin said: The five destroyers allocated to the United States will be destroyed. He expressed his satisfaction with the spirit of "international cooperation" shown by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in allocating the 92 Japanese ships. He said: He has always advocated holding the lottery as soon as possible so that the United States can know which ships should be destroyed, and on the other hand, can repair the ships that should be allocated to the other three countries. The destroyers participating in the lottery this time are divided into three classes: one is 1,580 tons, one is 1,530 tons, and another is 1,270 tons, which was won by Britain. The two destroyers obtained by China, one called "Ge" and one called "Shan", and one of the two 1,020-ton destroyer escorts, the Tsushima, was also allocated to China. The ships are currently berthed in Yokosuka, Kure, Sasebo, and Maizuru.</p>
<h3>Dismantling and Transferring Japanese Reparation Materials: China Will Set Up Two Committees to Handle Reception and Supervision</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The dismantling and transfer of Japanese early reparation materials is about to begin. The materials that China needs to dismantle in the previous month total 482,218 tons. In addition, the early dismantling materials are estimated to be more than one million. This work is extremely difficult. The Reparations Commission believes that "Reparations and Returned Materials Reception Committee" and "Reparations and Returned Materials Supervision and Transportation Committee" should be established to exclusively manage the reception and supervision of various issues, and has drafted organizational regulations and principles, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th] The Allied Headquarters is very concerned about the transfer of reparations. Today, it invited representatives from China, the United States, the Philippines, and France to study packaging methods. Japanese packaging workers held packaging demonstrations. The Chinese representative said that the packaging of reparations is progressing slowly due to the lack of various facilities, but it is generally satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Puyi Moved Away from Berh: Unknown Where He Was Moved To</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th, United Press] According to a Japanese prisoner of war recently sent back from the Soviet Union, Puyi, the former puppet emperor of Manchuria, has been moved from Berh to an unknown location. According to reports, Puyi was captured at the end of the war. Last year, he went to Japan to testify as a witness in the Far East War Crimes Tribunal, and then was sent back to the Soviet Union. Although China wanted to extradite him for trial as a war criminal at the time, it was unsuccessful. Japanese people returning home confirmed the news, saying that Puyi moved away from Berh on July 16, accompanied by his staff and his brother Pujie.</p>
<h3>Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Explains: Reasons for the Arrest of German Nationals in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that some Nazi German nationals in Shanghai had hidden themselves in various ways during their deportation last year to avoid leaving the country. The Ministry recently sent personnel to Shanghai with relevant case files to strictly enforce the re-deportation in order to fulfill China's obligations. On the morning of the 17th, the spokesman for the Ministry told reporters about the Shanghai police's arrest of German nationals: "The German nationals arrested on the 15th and 16th of this month were those who escaped or were left behind when German nationals and Nazis were deported last year. When the special ships for overseas Chinese sailed to Europe in July and September last year, a small number of German nationals who should have been deported avoided being concentrated. The rest were approved to reside in China temporarily. The Chinese government is now taking steps to complete the work of deporting them back to Germany."</p>
<h3>Li Qinglin to Go to Switzerland Today: To Attend the International Labor Agricultural Committee</h3>
<p>[This city news] Legislative member and agricultural economics expert Li Qinglin, at the invitation of the Permanent Agricultural Committee of the International Labor Bureau, will serve as a permanent agricultural committee member. Li left Beijing for Shanghai on the 17th and is scheduled to take a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Hong Kong on the 18th, and then fly to Geneva to attend the second meeting of the Committee to be held on the 4th of next month. After the meeting, he will also attend the first meeting of the International Agricultural Economics Scholars Association to be held in London at the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Philippine Vice President to Visit China</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 17th] Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino, who has just returned from visiting various countries, told reporters on the 16th that after Chinese Minister Chen Zhiping returns to the Philippines, he plans to visit Nanjing, which will be related to expanding the Philippines' diplomatic affairs.</p>
<h3>Britain to Put Forward New Proposal: The Japanese Peace Treaty to Be Drafted by Fourteen Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 17th] Authoritative sources declared today that Britain may propose to the United States and the Soviet Union that the Japanese peace treaty be drafted jointly by fourteen nations. In addition to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, South Africa and Myanmar hope to participate in the peace conference, as do India and the Islamic state of Pakistan. Although South Africa did not play an active role in the war against Japan, South African Prime Minister Smuts is very concerned about the future security of India and the Pacific. Myanmar was ravaged by the Japanese army during the war and made a huge contribution to the final victory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 16th] The British Foreign Office issued a statement last night saying that the British government welcomes the U.S.'s proposal to consider the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible. However, the timing is inconvenient because Britain has accepted the invitation of the Australian government to participate in the British Commonwealth Conference in Canberra on August 26 to exchange preliminary views. The British government hopes to consult with the countries of the Far Eastern Commission and hold a meeting after the Canberra Conference to discuss the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Raises Funds: Chairman Chiang's Inscription: Benevolence and Love for the People, the Greatest Relief; Many Hands Make Light Work, Sharing Compassion</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Military News Agency News: Chairman Chiang recently wrote an inscription for the fundraising business fund of the Chinese Red Cross Society. The Society has decided to raise a business fund of 5 billion yuan, which will begin on August 1. The full text of Chairman Chiang's inscription is as follows: The Red Cross Society is originally an international social relief organization. During wartime, it focuses on the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers. Its purpose is to serve the people, without sectarianism or national boundaries, and to extend grace to the four seas equally, which is the highest activity of the human spirit today. The Red Cross Society of China was founded in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War and has a history of more than 40 years. Its great achievements and effects have been shown during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The source of economic resources had no foundation at the beginning. Whenever disasters occur, donations are made temporarily according to the urgency of the situation, barely fulfilling the work, which is very contrary to the teaching of "preparation in advance", and especially feels the pain of temporary assistance. Since the restoration, the work has been strengthened, including social services in addition to disaster relief, and establishing a permanent business and laying a financial foundation has become the top priority. The members of the past councils have agreed, and it has been decided to raise a business fund of 5 billion yuan, establish a committee, and simultaneously raise funds in various districts, hoping to gather a number of people and establish a foundation. It is known that after the war, the people's livelihood has been in distress for a long time. People have a heart for music and justice, but their strength is difficult to follow. Only benevolence and love for the people are greater than relief. Accumulating rice and pennies, many hands make light work. Pushing the desire to save the hungry and rescue the drowning, and achieving the meaning of the Boatload of Benevolence, the benefits to the people's livelihood, and what a small supplement it is. All my countrymen and gentlemen, fortunately express their compassion and share their compassion.</p>
<h3>Du Zhenyuan Reports to Reporters in Guangzhou: The Truth About the Train Accident in Yingde; Derailment of a Freight Train Caused the Accident, with Only 77 Deaths and Injuries</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th] Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, recently hosted reporters here to report on the business and the truth about the train crash in Yingde. According to reports, the road was too badly damaged during the war, and it was restored to traffic within half a year after the restoration. To date a year, due to limited financial and material resources, everything is simple, so engineering, mechanical, and transportation work has encountered some difficulties, and the impact on safety is particularly great. Now the central government has approved construction funds of 97.6 billion yuan to speed up repairs. Safety can be guaranteed in the future, but it will still take more than 300 billion yuan to restore the pre-war standards. As for the Yingde incident, it was actually caused by the derailment of a freight train, which damaged the bridge and fell into the river. It was not the bridge that broke and caused the train to derail. However, the reason for the derailment, the uneven steel rails on the bridge deck, has fallen into the river and there is no trace to be found, so it is difficult to judge for a while. This time, there were 21 deaths and 56 injuries. The reporter asked why the long-distance phone call received in Yingde that night said that there were hundreds of deaths and injuries, and why the difference was so great. Du said that there were six cars that fell into the water at that time, and it was generally believed that they were all passenger cars, and it was estimated that there would be hundreds of deaths and injuries. He also had this imagination at the time, but later investigations revealed that there was only one passenger car among them, and the rest were all freight cars, so there were actually no hundreds of deaths and injuries. Du said at the end that the bridge has now begun to be driven, and traffic can be restored in a week.</p>
<h3>Drought in Guanzhong: Cotton Harvest Affected</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an, 17th] There have only been a few light rains in Guanzhong for four weeks. The rainfall is very small and has not yet wetted the soil, so the cotton bolls have been drying up and falling off the plants in large numbers. Agricultural expert Li Guozhen said: "With each day of delayed rainfall, the cotton yield per mu decreases by one jin." This year, the province's cotton acreage has increased by 3.18 million mu, one-third more than last year, but it is not敢 to be optimistic about the harvest. The flow of the Jinghui Canal has also been halved due to drought. Fortunately, there is enough rain in southern Shaanxi, and a bumper autumn harvest is expected.</p>
<h3>Floods in Northern Liaoning Cause Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang, 17th] It is still raining continuously in northern Liaoning, and floods are causing disaster. 60% of the farmland in Haicheng has been flooded, and the dikes in Panshan, Xinmin, and other counties have breached in many places, flooding many highways and fields. In addition, there are floods in Liaozhong and Tai'an, and the situation is getting worse.</p>
<h3>Central Government Allocates 1 Billion Yuan: Emergency Relief for Flood Disaster in Western Sichuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 17th] Serious floods in Chengdu and various counties in western Sichuan. 60% of Chengdu has become a swamp. According to the initial survey report by the Sichuan Provincial Government, there are more than 27,000 households and more than 82,000 victims in Chengdu.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Our Country Should Prepare for a Peace Treaty with Japan Early</h3>
<p>The United States, in order to expedite the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, has proposed to the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission that a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty be convened on August 19th. China, France, the Philippines, India, and the Netherlands are likely to agree. The United Kingdom and its dominions, having scheduled an imperial conference for August 26th to exchange views on the Japanese peace treaty issue, advocate postponing the preliminary conference. The only question remaining is the position of the Soviet Union. It is reported that when U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Smith met with Foreign Minister Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister immediately expressed dissent, arguing that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted by the Council of Foreign Ministers without the participation of other smaller nations. However, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall told reporters that he did not believe the Soviet Union would refuse to participate in the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty. As of now, the Soviet Union's position has not been finalized. According to informed sources in Washington, the U.S. initiative for a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty aims to convene a conference of the eleven Far Eastern nations outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission to draft a peace treaty with Japan, thereby avoiding the Soviet Union's exercise of veto power over any proposal, so that the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty can proceed smoothly. Therefore, whether the Soviet Union accepts the invitation to participate in the conference is indeed a serious issue.</p>
<p>As for our country's position on the Japanese peace treaty issue, we have already expressed it clearly. Although our country does not want to adopt a retaliatory approach and make overly harsh demands on Japan, our country has fought Japan for the longest time, suffered the most from Japanese aggression, and therefore suffered the greatest losses. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the War of Resistance, the total loss of public and private property in our country amounted to no less than 300 billion U.S. dollars, not including the national military expenditures over the past eight years. The deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians are even in the tens of millions, a colossal loss that is almost impossible to calculate. Now, after experiencing profound pain, our country is engaged in post-war reconstruction. Whether in terms of materials or economy, we need external assistance, especially Japanese reparations. Since Japan's surrender, it will soon be a full two years, and we have only seen and heard about Japan's recovery, but the date for convening the Japanese peace conference has been repeatedly postponed due to the failure to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria, which is certainly not what our country wants. However, since the unsuccessful Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Secretary of State Marshall returned to the United States and began to consider the method of drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, General MacArthur, has also repeatedly called for allied nations to accelerate the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. Former U.S. President Hoover even made shocking remarks early last month, advocating that the United States should exclude the Soviet Union and conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany and Japan. Although the State Department does not attach much importance to Hoover's proposal, the public feels a great interest in it. The desire of the American people for an early peace treaty with Japan is welcomed by the American people and the people of all relevant countries in the Far East.</p>
<p>The drafting of the Japanese peace treaty is related to the century-long plan for peace in the Far East. Before the opening of the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty, we must put forward a few opinions, firstly for everyone's reference, and secondly to awaken the attention of the people of our country.</p>
<p>First, our country not only made the greatest contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism during the war, but also bears the heaviest responsibility for maintaining peace in the Far East after the war. Therefore, in the Japanese peace conference, China should occupy a particularly important position, and its opinions should be given special attention by other countries. Our country itself should prepare early, so that it can have proactive suggestions when the conference opens. As Vice President Sun said on June 25th: "China should prepare to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, to ensure that Japan will never become an aggressor again and to work together to promote lasting peace in the East." State Councilor Wang Chonghui also said on July 9th: "The Executive Yuan is drafting a peace treaty with Japan, the content of which focuses on disarmament, reparations, trade, and immigration policies." Before the war, Japan was not only well-versed in military force, and our country should prepare concrete measures early and submit them to the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty for discussion.</p>
<p>Second, although MacArthur's control of Japan has undeniable achievements, "gentlemen can be deceived by their methods." MacArthur is inevitably too lenient and overly trusts the Japanese, because of their flattery and ingratiation. For example, former Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida formally notified MacArthur on May 10th of "Japan's views and wishes regarding the peace treaty." According to reports from the French News Agency, the main points of this secret document are three: (1) Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States; (2) Japan hopes to obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan; (3) Japan hopes to obtain fishing rights in the waters near South Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. Recently, a 90-year-old Japanese politician, Yukio Ozaki, proposed a major case for the future peace treaty, the main points of which are also two: (1) "Manchuria," Taiwan, and Ryukyu should hold referendums under the supervision of the United Nations to determine whether they should be independent or belong to which country; (2) The issue of Japanese reparations should be based on the losses suffered by both sides, and the compensation should be paid to the party with the greatest losses; if the victorious countries disregard this opinion, Japan should oppose their demands with non-cooperation. From this, it can be seen that Japan's aggressive ambitions are not only not dead, but are also stirring again. The preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty will have no room for considering the Japanese's arrogant and unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>Third, the Far Eastern Commission decided on its basic policy toward Japan on June 19th, the ultimate goal of which is to ensure that Japan no longer becomes a threat to world peace and prosperity. If the Allied nations want to achieve this goal, we believe that there must be concrete measures stipulated in the Japanese peace treaty. We believe that the best way to prevent Japan from re-aggression is for the relevant countries in the Far East, [blank space] five powers or four powers to reach a pact to prevent Japan from having illusions of aggression.</p>
<p>In short, the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty is related to the century-long plan for peace and increase in the Far East. Our country should prepare early so that it can put forward effective and reasonable proposals as a basis for discussion among all countries when the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty opens. We hope that all countries can face the reality of the Far East and understand our country's position, and give special attention to the opinions put forward by our country.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Conscription Issues</h3>
<p>Since the State Council passed the "Strict Implementation of National Mobilization" proposal and the Executive Yuan formulated the outline for the implementation of mobilization, the issue of conscription in Shanghai has entered an active stage. To mobilize all sectors to assist in conscription, the Shanghai Conscription Association has been formally established, and a meeting will be held this afternoon to promote the work. To discuss the advancement of conscription administration, the Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs and the Garrison Headquarters have been holding tea parties for several days. Xu Siping, the director of the Central Conscription Bureau, has also specially come to Shanghai to attend and report. It is reported that Shanghai is ready in terms of both the competent and co-competent aspects of the implementation procedures for conscription, and it can be started on August 1st. The implementation of conscription is an unprecedented event in Shanghai, and the success or failure of the future has a great bearing and deserves attention.</p>
<p>Conscription is an important policy of an independent country. An independent country should have its national defense, so it must have conscription as the potential to defend the country. The constitutions of any independent country stipulate that the people have the obligation to serve in the military, and the current constitution of our country also lists special articles. The Conscription Law is a substantive law that promotes conscription affairs and stipulates that people serve in the military. It stipulates that all men of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve in the military and at the same time everyone has the right to enjoy military service. Conscription affairs are irrespective of peacetime or wartime; the situation is the same in all countries. In peacetime, one must prepare for wartime, and in wartime, one must mobilize peacetime forces to defend the country, protect the territory, and maintain the survival and independence of the nation. Conscription is indeed a continuous life force of the country and the nation, an important policy that continues for hundreds of generations without decay.</p>
<p>During our country's eight-year War of Resistance, frontline soldiers rushed forward one after another, and replenishment was not felt to be lacking. The final victory was due to conscription. After the victory, the Communist bandits rebelled, and the mobilization of conscription to protect the safety of the country is even more imminent. It is truly a [blank space] matter that only Shanghai has been delayed until now. Recently, the municipal authorities have shown determination to promote conscription, and have agreed with the central government that Shanghai's allocated quota is 3,000 soldiers, mainly volunteers and supplemented by conscription. At the same time, in order to ensure the fairness and impartiality of conscription, people's representatives and representatives from all walks of life have been mobilized to form the Conscription Association to assist in the matter. However, the social phenomenon in Shanghai is very complicated, and the general public's understanding of conscription is not sufficient. This first-time conscription must involve many difficulties. Therefore, we are willing to put forward the following opinions, hoping that the municipal authorities and people from all walks of life will work hard to achieve them!</p>
<p>First, the issue of implementing voluntary service. The legislative spirit of our country's Conscription Law is to implement conscription, which has been the military system of the country for thousands of years and is also a modern new military system. The voluntary service system is of an auxiliary nature. How to "volunteer" and how to "serve" is only stipulated flexibly in Article 32 of the Conscription Law. However, the voluntary service system is a system with higher quality soldiers. The Youth Army in our country is serving based on volunteering. Shanghai has a population of four million, and according to surveys, there are approximately 460,000 eligible young men born between 1923 and 1927. Allocating 3,000 conscripts only accounts for one-fifteenth of the eligible young men, so implementing conscription according to the law should not be a problem. The authorities are now mainly implementing voluntary service and supplementing it with conscription, probably to reduce social disturbance and anxiety. However, it should be pointed out here: voluntary service is not recruitment, and the method of handling it cannot be based on mercenary means. If you really want to implement voluntary service, you must quickly call on educated youth to join the army and encourage outstanding youth to serve the country. Only in this way can the quality of voluntary service and the honor of the past Youth Army's enthusiastic enlistment be maintained. At the same time as implementing voluntary service, conscription must not be abandoned, and the two should be carried out without contradiction.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of preferential treatment for conscripts' families. The Conscription Law stipulates that those who serve in the military should enjoy many rights, such as students being allowed to retain their student status when they are drafted; workers being allowed to retain their original jobs; and the government being responsible for maintaining the living standards of their families while they are on combat duty, and so on. From the perspective of those who serve in the military, this is the right they should enjoy; from the perspective of the government and society, this is a kind of preferential treatment for those who serve in the military. Shanghai has a large population and is not short of enthusiastic and righteous people. It is better than other places to raise funds for preferential treatment and collect condolence materials. Therefore, it is hoped that the Conscription Association will quickly mobilize public power and stipulate various outbreaks of preferential treatment for conscripts' families to reduce the conscripts' worries, set an example for the whole country, and change the bad social atmosphere.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of exemption, deferment, and conscientious objector review. Conscription is a part of mobilization work, but among eligible men, there are personnel who are "not mobilizable" in both peacetime and wartime and who are engaged in the business of other departments. The Conscription Law's exemptions and deferments of conscription are specifically set up for this purpose. In addition to the legal provisions for deferment [blank space] summons, the competent authorities do not issue thousands of miles of administrative orders for temporary arrangements. The handling of conscription in Shanghai is an unprecedented event, and the number of people who legally meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons is expected to be quite large. We hope that the municipal authorities and the Conscription Association will stipulate that all those who legally meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons must pay expenses as a source of funds to raise settlement expenses for conscripts. However, those who do not meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons cannot be exempted from military service, even if they are willing to donate preferential treatment expenses, in order to prevent the abuse of "paying money for exemption from military service." If so, the livelihood relief of the 3,000 conscripts in Shanghai and the 3,000 conscripts' families will naturally not feel lacking.</p>
<p>In short, conscription is an important policy of the country, and Shanghai cannot escape it, and the people of Shanghai are even less willing to escape it. Today's country has entered an extraordinary period, and everyone must be mobilized to serve the country in order to strive for the survival of the nation. Shanghai has superior conditions for handling conscription, and there are many enthusiastic and righteous people. Although it is the first time to recruit soldiers, as long as it is done legally and reasonably, it will not only awaken the conscious and automatic investment of outstanding young people, but will surely establish a good scale, in order to receive the effect of the wind falling on the grass [immediate effect].</p>

<h3>France Prepares Concrete Proposals for the Implementation of the Marshall Plan, Raising Discussions at the Committee on European Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 16th] The Committee on European Economic Cooperation began drafting a report on European resources and their needs today. France proposed submitting eight sets of questions to the member states for their answers. The French proposal will be discussed by the Committee on European Economic Cooperation at its meeting tomorrow morning. The purpose of these eight sets of questions is to facilitate the drafting of the Committee on Cooperation's report, which will serve as the basis for the scope of U.S. economic aid to Europe.</p>
<p>According to the plan formulated by the French Four-Year Reconstruction Plan Committee, the eight sets of questions will determine the following three points: (1) What kind of efforts have European countries made to overcome the difficulties caused by the war? (2) What kind of mutual assistance and mutual support already exists between European countries? (3) How much external assistance do countries need at a minimum to ensure European economic recovery? The overseas territories of member states will also be included in the settlement statement in terms of the products necessary for European recovery. Methods to increase the production of these products will also be included in the European Recovery Plan.</p>
<p>The questions proposed by France are divided into eight categories, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Studying the difficulties caused by the war, this issue is being reviewed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. (2) Analyzing the efforts made by various countries to restore their national economies. (3) Analyzing the contributions made by various countries to the restoration of other countries. (4) Studying the efforts that European countries plan to make in the four years from 1947 to 1950. (5) The balance between supply and demand for food and raw materials. (6) The balance of imports and exports of various facilities and industrial products. (7) Determining the elements of the balance of payments for various countries from 1947 to 1950. (8) In addition to making the above-mentioned efforts, each country should also contribute to other countries in terms of loans and manpower.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] A French spokesperson recently stated that the above-mentioned eight items will be submitted to the Committee on Cooperation for discussion at 10:30 tomorrow morning, and a decision will be made immediately on their role as the main economic factors in carrying out the European Recovery Plan. It is also learned that the five-nation Executive Committee will meet at the French Foreign Ministry tonight to discuss adjusting the work schedule of the Coordination Committee and the four subcommittees on food, steel, hydroelectric power, and transportation. Representatives from Sweden and Denmark believe that the French proposal is too long, while the Dutch representative believes that it is difficult to estimate the recovery plan for more than three years.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Policy Towards Germany: French Government Expresses Concern; Britain Hopes Washington Negotiations Will Expand Scope</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Reliable sources report: French Foreign Minister Bidault informed the French cabinet that during a private conversation with British Foreign Secretary Bevin, he expressed the French government's deep concern regarding the US government's directive to General Clay, commander of the US military zone in Germany and US representative to the Allied Control Council, as it indicates a potential change in US policy toward Germany. Furthermore, France is also highly concerned about the Anglo-American negotiations on German industry, fearing that these negotiations will extend beyond the scope of "industrial level" and involve the organization and political administration of the Ruhr region. France believes that this matter will have a significant impact on France's political and economic life, and therefore requests to participate in the discussions. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Bevin has assured Bidault that France will be kept informed of the progress of the Anglo-American talks in Washington.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The Anglo-American negotiations in Washington on the Ruhr coal issue have not yet reached a definite conclusion. It is only known that the chief British representative will be Mr. Strang, British political advisor in Germany, and Lieutenant General Robertson, deputy commander of the British military zone in Germany. According to speculation in Berlin, the negotiations are expected to result in an agreement to establish a new control mechanism for Ruhr coal production and to transfer the management of Ruhr coal mines to Germans under joint Anglo-American supervision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Authoritative sources report: In light of the food and economic situation in the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, which has increased the burden of US dollar expenditure on Britain, Britain has suggested to the United States to expand the scope of the upcoming Anglo-American talks in Washington on the Ruhr coal issue to include general economic and food issues in the Anglo-American merged zone. These talks are scheduled to take place here within the next week. It is understood that Britain is responsible for half of the expenses of the Anglo-American merged zone, which is a significant burden for Britain, which lacks US dollars. Moreover, the budget for the Anglo-American merged zone, decided in Washington last December, is now deemed insufficient, so Britain intends to take the opportunity of next week's negotiations to review it.</p>
<p>America Values Ruhr Coal Production</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Marshall stated here today that the United States hopes to increase coal production in the Ruhr region. Meanwhile, British authorities in Berlin announced that the Anglo-American agreement to raise German iron and steel production standards has decided to announce an indefinite extension. At a press conference today, Mr. Marshall pointed out that the increase in Ruhr coal production is the foundation of the European recovery plan. He believes that the Ruhr is the raw material center needed for European recovery and attaches great importance to it. However, he also stated that he does not intend to take any action in the near future that would cast doubt on the fact that the initiative for the Marshall Plan for European aid should be in the hands of Europe.</p>
<p>No Change in Policy Towards Germany</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] US Secretary of Commerce Harriman stated here today that US policy toward Germany has not changed due to the US government's directive to General Clay, commander of the US military zone in Germany, yesterday. After pointing out that the average industrial production in the Anglo-American zone in Germany is only 38% of the 1936 level, while the average industrial production in the rest of Europe has reached 90% of the 1936 level, Mr. Harriman declared that the United States does not intend to give Germany a priority position in the economic recovery of Europe. The United States has not granted and does not intend to grant such a priority position, but intends to enable Germany to fulfill its due obligations in the economic recovery of Europe. The issuance of the directive to General Clay at this time has absolutely no special purpose. Mr. Harriman also said that the United States is greatly encouraged by the achievements of the Paris Conference and is now awaiting its results.</p>
<h3>Wallace Supports the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>Claims Soviet Union Will Harm Its Reputation in Europe</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] Wallace recently published an article in the current issue of "The New Republic," advocating that the United Nations should immediately implement a non-political emergency foreign relief plan. He strongly argued that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's withdrawal from the Paris Economic Conference would undoubtedly damage the Soviet Union's reputation in Europe. He stated: According to the Marshall Plan for European economic aid, it will take at least a year before supplies can be shipped to Europe, so it is essential to address Europe's needs immediately. This is extremely important. The United Nations can only strengthen its position by implementing an emergency relief plan. In addition, a path must be opened to fully implement the cooperation plan originally intended by Marshall. Regarding the proposal to make a separate peace with Germany and unite Western countries outside the United Nations, he expressed opposition. He also said that if the United States forcefully implements its original control plan and forces the United Nations General Assembly to accept or reject it, we will face the danger of reorganizing the United Nations. At the very least, we will see the establishment of a defense system outside the United Nations structure.</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Suggests Franco-Italian Economic Alliance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza stated before returning to Italy that establishing a Franco-Italian economic alliance would promote the interests of both countries, and this alliance should include a customs union.</p>
<h3>European Economic Commission Ends Unhappily</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Hold Another Meeting Early Next Year</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 16th] The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ended its ten-day meeting on the 16th amidst extreme views from the Soviet Union and Western countries. Soviet representative Tsarapkin, in his closing remarks, accused the policies of Britain and the United States of dividing Germany and the entire Europe. Mr. Tsarapkin also made some complimentary remarks about France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 16th] The United Nations Economic Conference for Europe engaged in fierce debate today. The chairman, having no choice, immediately intervened and announced the adjournment of the second session, with the third session scheduled to be held in 1948.</p>
<h3>Albanian Prime Minister Visits the Soviet Union; Stalin Receives Him</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 16th] Marshal Stalin received Albanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister General Hoxha today. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the Albanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union were also present.</p>
<h3>Polish Representative Suggests to the Security Council that Foreign Troops Should Withdraw from Greece; Debate on Egypt's Complaint Against Britain Rescheduled</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 17th Broadcast: Poland today requested the Security Council to organize a united government in Greece and to expel foreign troops and "military advisors" stationed in Greece through United Nations action. It is believed here that the purpose of Poland's suggestion is to hinder the work of the United Nations border investigation team on the Greek, Albanian, and Bulgarian borders.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 17th Broadcast: The Security Council held a meeting today. The important developments were as follows: (1) The Polish representative requested the Security Council to find a way to end the seven-year state of war between Greece and Albania; (2) The British representative stated that he did not object to Egypt's demand to end British occupation of the Nile River. However, because the Balkan issue is more important, the British-Egyptian issue should be postponed to August 5 for discussion. The result was passed.</p>
<h3>US Position Firm</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] United Nations officials stated today that if the Soviet Union exercises its veto to prevent the Security Council from establishing a semi-permanent Balkan investigation team, the United States may propose establishing an investigation team outside the United Nations structure to monitor the situation on the Greek border. This could be done by having Greece invite other members of the United Nations to form an independent investigation team, establish a headquarters in Greece, and monitor the activities of Balkan guerrillas. Although this investigation team would not have authority, it could collect information and submit it to their respective governments when the United Nations General Assembly meets in September. However, the United States and Britain seem to be trying their best to change reality and take other measures before resorting to this approach. According to well-informed sources, if the Soviet Union uses its veto power to obstruct this matter, a new complaint may be filed in the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter regarding threats to peace and breaches of peace. At that time, the Security Council can discuss measures other than the use of force, such as economic sanctions and severance of diplomatic relations, to deal with the accused country.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Turkey's Transportation System: Ten US Merchant Ships Sold to Turkey</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Marshall revealed today that he has requested the US Maritime Commission to approve the sale of ten US merchant ships to Turkey under the recent aid to Turkey plan approved by Congress. Mr. Marshall requested that, to his knowledge, this is the first batch of materials transferred to Turkey under the aid to Turkey plan. These ships will be sold to the purchasing delegation of the Turkish Ministry of Transportation, and the Turkish government will pay the price. The purpose of the sale is to enable Turkey to replace old ships with new ones to strengthen its transportation system.</p>
<h3>Truman Unwilling to Participate in Direct Talks Among the Big Three</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] It was learned on the 17th that President Truman stated that unless Soviet Marshal Stalin and British Prime Minister Attlee travel to the United States to confer with him, he will continue to firmly oppose holding another Big Three conference. This news was revealed on the second anniversary of the ill-fated Potsdam Conference. That Big Three conference was Truman's first and perhaps last participation in a high-level secret international conference. Truman and his advisors believe that it is not advisable for heads of state to participate in secret negotiations during peacetime, and it is incompatible with the American system. They also openly blamed the secret agreements of the late President Roosevelt for being responsible for many of the current world disputes. Few of the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement have been implemented because the major powers have failed to find an acceptable way to implement them, especially the provisions concerning Germany. After two years of fruitless disputes and negotiations, although each major power claims to still adhere to its overall goals, the Potsdam Agreement, whether in implementation or in form, has become waste paper. US officials admit that the United States and the Soviet Union are now engaged in a full-scale diplomatic and economic war, and US-Soviet relations are deteriorating at an accelerating rate, and will deteriorate sharply in the near future.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Suffer Heavy Blows; Greek War Turns Quiet; British Officers Assist in Suppression of Rebellion as Advisors</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wanjingshan, 17th Broadcast: The Greek war has become quiet today. The guerrillas who attacked Greece from Albania have retreated to the border mountains after suffering heavy blows from the government forces. There were only minor conflicts today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 16th] Military sources announced today that the Greek army, under the protection of aircraft and heavy artillery, launched a large-scale offensive tonight against approximately 2,500 guerrillas in the mountainous area north of Ioannina, near the Albanian border, wiping out 300 of them. The main force of the guerrillas retreated eastward, attempting to join other left-wing bandits in the Grammos Mountains. Army aircraft stepped up their pursuit, while infantry swept through the rear guard forces covering their retreat. Before the government forces began their advance, they heavily bombed and strafed the guerrilla-trapped area on the slopes of Mount Gamila, encountering resistance only near Elafotopos and Asproangeloi, about 19 miles from Ioannina.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] A British Foreign Office spokesman solemnly denied that any form of British troops had actively participated in Greece's war against the guerrillas. When asked whether British officers had assisted the Greek government forces attacking the guerrillas in an advisory capacity, he replied that the mission of British troops in Greece was to help maintain order, which was well known to all. It is reported that Greek guerrilla commander Markos claimed to have captured British officers and soldiers, and the British Foreign Office made the above statement in response.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Tirana Radio reported a report from the Albanian Telegraph Agency denying that Albanian guerrilla units were fighting in the Konitsa area of northern Greece, and denying the claim that an "international brigade" had invaded Greece from Albania.</p>

<h3>Holy Land Issue Included in the Provisional Agenda of the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Beattie, told the press today that the Palestine issue has been included in the provisional agenda of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September. There are currently 38 items on the provisional agenda, most of which were left over from the previous General Assembly without a decision, such as the Spanish issue. The provisional agenda will be sent to the governments of the member states on the 17th of this month. The Palestine issue will be presented in three aspects: (1) The request submitted by Britain, which mainly discusses the Palestine issue during the ordinary session of the General Assembly; (2) The report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine; (3) The request submitted by Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which mainly advocates that Britain terminate its trusteeship over Palestine and recognize the independence of Palestine. According to officials in charge, the next session of the United Nations General Assembly will last for seven weeks.</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Reorganization; India Office Abolished</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Sources here reveal that the transfer of political power in India has forced the British cabinet to make changes. After the abolition of the India Office, Lord Listowel, who was originally the Minister of State for India and Burma Affairs, will now only be the Minister of State for Burma Affairs. Mr. Henderson, who was originally the Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma Affairs, will become the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, responsible for British relations with India and Pakistan, and will represent Lord Listowel in being accountable to the House of Commons for Burmese affairs. The Commonwealth Relations Office is the former Dominions Office, renamed because the name "Dominion" no longer suits the environment.

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Control of Atomic Energy; Establishes International Distribution System; Representatives of Various Countries Have Not Expressed Opinions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] Soviet representative Gromyko proposed at a secret meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission on the 16th that a world atomic agreement be signed to control the mining and distribution of uranium and thorium resources in various countries. He also said that if this proposal is accepted, there may be decisive progress in the global control of atomic energy. The scope of the Soviet proposal may include all atomic energy equipment and atomic energy elements, and will detail the methods and limits for each country to use atomic energy equipment and elements. Gromyko advocated the establishment of a separate special committee to study these limits, so that the Atomic Energy Commission would not have the power to intervene in this matter. Gromyko also argued that the limits should be adjusted each time, and the agreement could also be amended. Representatives of various countries were unwilling to express their opinions on the Soviet Union's sudden proposal. This proposal is the Soviet Union's third proposal. Gromyko had previously proposed concluding an agreement to immediately destroy atomic bombs and then proposed the organization of an international control agency to investigate and control atomic energy. The United States advocated that the International Atomic Energy Agency should have the right to handle all uranium resources that have been mined in the world, but this was opposed by Gromyko.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Controlled Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's strategy of using the Japanese Communist Party to oppose the American occupation authorities created the most critical situation since the American occupation of Japan in January of this year. Labor unions controlled by the Communist Party were brewing a general strike to sabotage the Japanese economic system. At that time, strike leaders received notification from the occupation authorities prohibiting the strike. According to Japanese people familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party, the Communist Party committee that directed the strike had contacted Soviet personnel stationed in Japan to obtain Soviet support.</p>
<p>According to a certain labor union report: Soviet authorities told the Japanese Communist Party: "You should remember the sixteen principles." (Note: The Far Eastern Commission announced sixteen principles regarding Japan on December 18, 1946, one of which permitted strikes for "political action.") A Soviet adjutant told the Japanese Communist Party to simply ignore the occupation forces' orders prohibiting strikes. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued an order, shamelessly stating: "Regarding our strike, we have already obtained the understanding of the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Committee. Therefore, there is no need to fear the orders of the occupation authorities." Although the Japanese Communist Party claims to have 50,000 members, only 25,000 Communist Party members dare to defy the Japanese occupation forces. However, their influence far exceeds their actual numbers. They run newspapers and many Japanese magazines, organize cultural societies and people's fronts, establish youth groups and a university. The Communist Party often exploits the general ignorance of the common people, launching demonstrations, waving red flags, and shouting slogans they do not understand, which ultimately led to a ban by the occupation authorities.</p>
<p>The Japanese Communist Party is now making every effort to instigate the historically conservative farmers. They were the behind-the-scenes instigators of the recent disturbances that prevented rice and grain from being transported to the cities. During the last general election, they did not focus on parliamentary elections, but instead devoted all their efforts to local elections. Several non-partisan candidates later became Communist Party members. They are also trying to get Communist Party members into schools to make up for the 120,000 Japanese teachers who were purged.</p>
<p>However, the main method by which the Communist Party expands its influence is by infiltrating and controlling various labor unions. In Japan, where the labor union movement is still in its infancy, the Communist Party can also manipulate labor unions in other ways, such as often being able to win over inexperienced labor union leaders. They can also recommend technical personnel such as bookkeepers and typists to new labor unions, and gradually rise to important positions such as secretaries. The Japanese Congress of Industrial Organizations, an important labor union organization, is controlled by the Communist Party. Many of the labor unions affiliated with the Congress are effectively controlled by the Communist Party. The two major strongholds of the Communist Party are the National Railway Workers' Union, which has 540,000 workers, and the Transportation Workers' Union, which has 380,000 workers. In Japan, as in other countries, the Communist Party is using all its strength to control key industries that could cause the country's economy to collapse instantly.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the Japanese Communist Party used the labor union power it had already acquired to stage a surprising demonstration. As usual, they put forward a resolute demand, citing high prices as the reason, and demanding a wage increase. The Communist Party then organized the "National Federation of Government and Public Employees' Struggle Committee," which was soon expanded into the "National Federation of Labor Union Struggle Committee." The Communist Party occupied one-third of the forty-six members of the committee, which was more than enough to control the committee. At the same time, the three leaders and senior cadres of the committee were also controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The purpose of the "United Struggle Committee" was to implement the policies of the Communist Party and launch a general strike of the two million workers represented by the committee. Part of the goal was to overthrow the conservative Yoshida Cabinet. Therefore, the committee deliberately put forward extremely high demands that the government could hardly accept. Therefore, this strike was clearly political, which was admitted by Shiga, one of the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party. The Communist Party could invoke the sixteen principles announced by the Far Eastern Committee in Washington at any time.</p>
<p>However, the main purpose of the Japanese Communist Party was to create chaos in Japan in order to undermine the American occupation. The consequences of the strike, in addition to the industry falling into a state of paralysis, would immediately lead to starvation and social unrest. This is the result of the deepening resentment between the occupation authorities and the Communist Party. The Communist Party initially thought that the Americans treated them very well, because the Americans not only released them from prison, but also received them very politely. However, by the autumn of 1946, the Communist Party realized their mistake and began to oppose and attempt to undermine the American occupation mission.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's attempt to brew a general strike ultimately failed. MacArthur resolutely issued an order prohibiting strikes, and warned of severe punishment for violations. At that time, the Soviet Union was unable to fulfill its promise to support the Japanese Communist Party. Since then, Japanese public opinion has been unanimously opposed to the Japanese Communist Party. But the Japanese Communist Party forced MacArthur to interfere in Japan's internal affairs against his will. In addition, the American occupation is still bound by the sixteen principles of the Far Eastern Commission, the White House's orders encouraging the labor union movement, and the Potsdam Declaration. Until the above-mentioned orders are changed, the Japanese Communist Party can still openly challenge the American occupation authorities. (Translated from Newsweek)</p>

<h3>Philippine Puppet President Laurel on Trial</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Manila, 17th] The Philippine People's Court began hearing the treason case against the puppet president Laurel this afternoon. Sound newsreels were played on the spot, showing Laurel during the war "maintaining Japanese former Prime Minister Tojo, saving hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia from British and American rule." Laurel himself couldn't help but laugh wryly when he heard the words. The film was captured by the U.S. military. Despite objections from the defendant's lawyers, it was eventually presented as evidence. According to Nakayama, an official of the former Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan, the filming time was November 1943, and the participants in the Tokyo Greater East Asia Conference included puppet government leaders from various countries.</p>

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Sends Personnel to Inspect Coal Mine Production Conditions</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 17th] The issue of national management of Japanese coal mines has now developed to the serious extent of whether the Katayama Cabinet can continue to cooperate. However, the Democratic Party's disagreement with the implementation of the national management system is determined by the circumstances of whether production can be increased. In order to investigate the actual situation of whether production can be increased in various coal mines, the House of Representatives has organized a coal mine inspection team from various parties to go to Hokkaido to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the production conditions of various coal mines, as a basis for whether to implement national management in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Demobilized Soldiers: Government Will Provide Loans for Relief</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 17th] State Minister Masamori said to reporters in Osaka on the 17th regarding the issue of demobilized soldiers: "We will work hard to ensure that Japanese soldiers remaining overseas return home as soon as possible.

<h3>Trade Negotiations Progress Smoothly British and Soviet Union Have Concluded an Agreement Detailed Content Can be Announced This Weekend</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, 10th] Smith, the representative of the British commercial delegation who had just returned here from Moscow, said on the 16th that after the British and Soviet Union concluded a timber agreement, food negotiations are progressing smoothly.

<h3>Far East Economic Commission Establishes Contact with Japan and South Korea</h3>
<p>Non-UN Members Permitted to Attend</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 16th] The plenary committee of the Far East Economic Commission passed a proposal made by the U.S. and the Soviet Union today to formally establish contact between Japan and South Korea and the committee. The United States proposed the following terms of reference to the committee: The committee may consult with representatives of the Allied Headquarters in Japan and representatives of the occupation authorities in Korea, and the latter may also consult with the committee in order to exchange information and provide opinions on economic issues related to other Far Eastern countries and the economies of Japan and South Korea. The Soviet proposal was almost identical to the American one, except that it did not directly name Japan and South Korea, but only referred to "occupied areas." The Soviet Union further requested that the committee's powers be expanded to make recommendations to member states. The plenary committee finally passed a joint US-Thailand proposal today to resolve the procedural dispute over allowing sponsoring conferences to participate in the committee. The proposal stipulates that any country within the geographical scope of the committee in the Far East that is not a member of the United Nations may apply to the country responsible for its diplomacy to become a sponsoring member. If those countries are already responsible for their own diplomacy, they can apply directly. The latter is clearly designed for Burma and Ceylon, as these two non-UN member states will likely gain dominion or independent nation status.</p>

<h3>Qiantang Train Derailed in Danyang Early Detection Prevented Major Accident Passengers Transported to Shanghai in Two Batches All Trains Delayed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Qiantang train (Beijing-Hangzhou express train), train No. 1, from Beijing to Shanghai, derailed on its rear wheels of the third FD 613 first-class dining car at 10:14 a.m. after passing Danyang Station (non-stop). Fortunately, the speed of the train was very low at this time, and there were many people on the station. The stationmaster had not yet left, and witnessed the train making strange noises and violent shocks, knowing that an accident had occurred. He immediately dispatched two station workers to catch up with the locomotive with red flags to notify them to brake immediately, avoiding a rollover. All passengers were safe and sound. The passenger car was also undamaged, only two sections of steel rail were slightly curled, and more than 200 sleepers were broken by the shock. Changzhou Station heard the sound and urgently dispatched a rescue train to the scene of the accident. Chen Baoxing, the chief of the engineering section, personally led more than 100 technicians to repair and replace the damaged steel rails and sleepers, which took 40 minutes to repair. After the accident, the train had unloaded the third dining car. The locomotive and the first and second first-class carriages were not affected and departed for Shanghai at 10:50 a.m., arriving in Shanghai at 4:23 p.m. The six passenger cars behind the dining car were temporarily added to the locomotive and drove to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station of this city at 7:01 p.m. The first and second first-class passenger cars arrived in Hangzhou only 55 minutes later than usual. The fifth, seventh, and fifteenth trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line were delayed by two or three hours, and other trains were not affected.</p>
<h3>Disturbance at Danyang Station</h3>
<p>At that time, Danyang Station was blamed by the passengers of the Qiantang train, which once caused a disturbance. Because this accident did not cause a major disaster, the passengers were deeply grateful. Since it was close to noon, and the station informed them that the repair would take a long time, the passengers went ashore to Danyang city to eat. Unexpectedly, when they returned to the station after the meal, the locomotive had already towed the first two passenger cars away. Many of the passengers in the first two sections had placed their briefcases, long gowns, and tops in the cars. The passengers in the last six sections complained that the locomotive should not have towed the first two sections first, and also rose up to blame. The Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau promised to send a telegram to the stationmasters along the line to carefully protect the ownerless luggage and sundries in the first two cars, and to send another locomotive to tow the last six passenger cars to Shanghai and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>It is reported that the reason why this derailment did not become a major disaster was that the recent Railway Bureau's traffic safety meeting decided that from the 11th to the 22nd of this month, it was the week of work safety competition, and the speed of all trains was generally reduced. The speed of the Qiantang train at the time of the accident yesterday was 33 kilometers per hour (the slowest limit). If it was still at the normal speed (50 kilometers), it would have led to a fatal rollover. As for the cause of the derailment, the Engineering Department and its colleagues were still puzzled after studying it, because there was no broken rail there, and the sleepers and steel rails were all in good condition, and the driving speed was extremely slow, so there was no reason to explain the cause of the accident. Danyang Station has taken detailed photos of the situation and reported it to the Administration, and experts will study it further.</p>

<h3>North Railway Station Renovation and Expansion Expected to be Completed by End of September Order Should be Improved</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration believes that there are many passengers at the North Railway Station in this city, and vehicles are frequent. Although there is a large square in front of the station, the entrances and exits are narrow and uneven. The vehicles parked in the square are also lacking in meticulous distribution. The Engineering Department of the Administration has prepared a large-scale renovation and expansion plan, and has agreed to assist with the City Engineering Bureau, raise special funds, and start construction on the 13th. The various projects will be carried out in stages, and it is expected that all work can be completed by the end of September this year. According to its engineering plan: the entrance to Tianmu Road does not include three entrances. Cars in the middle row can directly reach the main entrance of the terminal station. The left and right entrances are used by rickshaws, tricycles, or pedestrians. All rickshaws and vehicles used by passengers in the second, third, and fourth classes will use the right-hand entrance, pass through the road in front of the dining room, and go directly to the large waiting room. Rickshaws used by first-class passengers will use the left-hand entrance and get off at the south right side of the station. There is a private car parking lot in the middle of the square, 56 meters long and 30 meters wide, which can park more than 60 cars. The ground is inlaid with iron sheets to mark the location of each car. A horseshoe-shaped lane is built around the parking lot. The exit leads to Baoshan Road. The original road width is only 6 to 12 meters. Now it is decided to widen it to 20 meters uniformly, rebuild the large stone road, and pave a 7.5 cm thick asphalt concrete pavement. The area in front of the large waiting room is still a parking area for traffic vehicles, and the Baoshan Road intersection on the east side is designated as a parking area for business trip vehicles (can accommodate 15 vehicles). More than 30 private cars can be parked on the south side of the road to supplement the square. In the east, a 40-meter-long and 5.5-meter-wide rickshaw parking area is designated, which can park more than 70 rickshaws. The sidewalks around the station are twice as wide as before.

<h3>Detaining Ships and Extorting Taxes Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Strict Punishment</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce received a joint letter from the members of the Pig Industry Commercial Guild, Yuansheng, Huiyuan, and Tianyuan, stating that at 7:00 a.m. on July 9, a sailing ship transporting fresh pigs from Nantong Ren Port to Shanghai arrived at Tangqing Port (transliteration) upstream of Liu River at about 2:00 p.m. A team of ten people wearing grass green uniforms and hats with the military symbol (one person in a suit), approached on two ships and ordered them to pay taxes, at least 70,000 yuan per pig. When they were told that they had no money to pay the tax, they detained the ship in the port. After repeated requests, they initially demanded ten pigs to offset the tax, but eventually reduced it to eight pigs (and were extorted 60,000 yuan in cash), forcing them to send them to the team headquarters, and gave them a receipt, claiming to be the First Joint Defense Patrol Team. The association believes that the military's supplies are planned and allocated by the Ministry of National Defense, and should not be borrowed from the people privately. The chairman has repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, which are published in newspapers. They have telegraphed to the First Pacification Headquarters of Nantong and the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation and strict punishment, to protect merchants and people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Shanghai Machine Factory Workers Petition</p>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The index dispute in the iron can manufacturing industry has been resolved. Workers' wages will be handled in accordance with the government-announced method, with a 10% discount. In addition, the index dispute at the Continental Rubber Factory has been resolved.

Yesterday afternoon, all the workers of the factory petitioned the Social Bureau, claiming that the factory wanted to dismiss the workers' representatives Yan Linsheng and Zhang Delang.

<h3>Shanghai Silk Mill Closes; Social Bureau Approves Layoffs</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Due to sluggish business, the Shanghai Silk Mill has announced its closure.

<h3>Rental Management Measures Deemed Unfair by Guild</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Chen Tingkun, Secretary-General of the Real Estate Industry Guild of this city, expressed his opinion on the city government's decision on the "Rental Management Measures for Houses in This City" the day before yesterday, stating that, generally speaking, the measures can take care of both landlords and tenants, but what is regrettable is that the phrase "based on 10% of the total of the above actual expenses" added in parentheses after adding profits in the first article is not fair. Judging from the provision in Article 4 of these measures regarding the subletting of houses, which states that "the maximum shall not exceed twice the original rent," the bias is very obvious. Because the original rent of the sub-landlord is the total amount of expenses for the house, in other words, the profit of the landlord, which can only be based on 10% of the total expenses, while the profit of the sub-landlord can be 100% of the total expenses. Moreover, the owner's investment in the property and the depreciation of the house have not been taken into account. In this regard, it seems that only the interests of the sub-landlord's subletting have been paid attention to, and the rights and interests of the owner are still suppressed.</p>

<h3>Believe it or Not: Flying Saucers Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Three flying saucers have visited Shanghai! This was stated by an Italian expatriate to a reporter from the English-language "Da Mei Evening News" yesterday. He spoke vividly, claiming that his residence was near Longhua in the western district of the former French Concession. At 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he was tossing and turning in bed and could not fall asleep. He happened to look out the window and suddenly saw a gray-white object flying over the top of an apartment building across from his apartment, flying quickly towards the Bund at about the speed of an ordinary airplane. It was flat in shape, shiny, but did not emit light. At that time, it was not yet dawn and the sky was dark, so he saw this gray-white, aura-like object very clearly. About fifteen minutes after this "flying saucer" flew past, he saw two more, but they disappeared in a flash. Whether they had flown out of his sight or were hidden by clouds, he did not know. Since the mystery of the flying saucer has been hyped up in the United States, people all over the world have been suspicious. It has been reported that flying saucers have been discovered in Shenyang and Xi'an in our country in recent days. Now there is a saying that they have visited Shanghai. Whether to believe it or not is up to the readers to judge for themselves.</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Rates on Ships Are Being Brewed for Another Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Passenger and freight rates for ships were adjusted on June 12 of this year, and then again on July 7.

However, passengers have been significantly affected by the previously increased fares, and if they are adjusted again, they will not be able to afford it.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Continues the Romance in Beiping; The Newlyweds Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The bride, Zhou Bixia, was once famous in social circles</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Zhang Jia'ao (see picture), Governor of the Central Bank, recently married Ms. Zhou Bixia in the former capital. According to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang's trip to the Northeast has now been cancelled. He returned to Beiping from Tianjin at noon on the 16th, and took a trip to the suburbs at noon on the 17th. He is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai this morning (the 18th).</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou is over forty years old. Before the war, she graduated from Shanghai McTyeire School and was quite famous in Shanghai social circles fifteen or sixteen years ago. Zhang Jia'ao was then the President of the Bank of China, and they met and became friends at that time. During the Anti-Japanese War, Ms. Zhou traveled to the United States, where Mr. Zhang was also inspecting railways. They interacted more and more frequently, and their feelings grew stronger. After the victory, when Mr. Zhang was ordered to preside over the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, Ms. Zhou was still in the United States and did not return until last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang held the wedding in Beiping this time without a public ceremony. He only invited a few tables of guests, and a few friends attended to congratulate him. According to a telegram from a special correspondent of this newspaper in Beiping: Mr. Zhang married Ms. Zhou secretly at a certain place on the third day of his arrival in Beiping. Local transportation and financial tycoons seemed to keep silent about this matter. However, when Li Zongren and his wife hosted a banquet for Hu Zhengzhi without his wife at 7:00 p.m. on the 4th, Zhang Jia'ao also accompanied his new wife to the banquet. Those present at the time also included He Siyuan and his wife, Wang Hongshao (Chief of Staff of the Beiping Executive Headquarters), and Xiao Yishan. According to witnesses, Mrs. Zhang wore a light blue cheongsam that day and looked as beautiful as a woman in her thirties.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang live upstairs in the Beiping Office of the Northeast Economic Commission at Dengshikou. People around Zhang insist that the several female guests upstairs are Zhang's sisters and relatives. It is reported that Mr. Zhang is now 59 years old and has been widowed for several years. He has nine children, the youngest of whom is nicknamed "Little Nine" and is currently studying in Beiping.</p>

<h3>An Additional 10,000 Yuan in Expenses for Each Shi of Low-Priced Rice; Industrial Workers Get Two Jin of Cooking Oil per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee held its third meeting at its meeting place on Huangpi South Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The meeting was presided over by Director Wu Kaixian. First, the persons in charge of the investigation, review, and distribution departments reported on the work situation, and then the discussion began. The important proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>Low-Priced Rice for Poor Households to be Distributed Soon</p>
<p>(1) Low-priced broken rice for poor households is calculated at 168,000 yuan per shi. Recently, an order was received from the Ministry of Food to increase 10,000 yuan per shi for excavation expenses. The low-priced rice for June can be distributed after the low-priced rice certificates are issued in a few days. The budget for handling low-priced rice expenses reported by each district is uniformly approved as: 1. Transportation fee is 4,000 yuan per shi in the urban area and 7,000 yuan per shi in the suburban area; 2. Warehouse fee is 1,300 yuan per shi; 3. Office expenses for each low-priced rice handling by the district office are 1 million yuan per district; 4. Handling fee for rice shops selling low-priced rice is 800 yuan per shi; 5. Loss is generally limited to no more than 0.2 liters per shi. Because the stipulated handling fee for each low-priced rice station (rice shop selling low-priced rice) is only 800 yuan per shi, each district will generally sell 500 shi through each low-priced rice station, and the suburban area may appropriately increase the amount.</p>
<p>Private Hospitals to Stop Allocating Rice</p>
<p>(2) The "Implementation Measures for Oil Allocation for Industrial Workers" were approved, with two jin per person, once a month, handled by the Food Allocation Committee. Each factory only needs to list the grain allocation order number, household number, and number of people of the original rice allocation to apply for allocation, without having to create a separate roster. The "Implementation Measures for Oil Allocation" will be announced after President Zhang of the Central Bank returns to Shanghai from North China and the China Trust Bureau signs an agreement with the Allocation Committee. The committee also received an order from the Ministry of Food to stop allocating rice to private hospitals from now on.</p>
<p>Coal Briquettes for Allocation Yet to be Decided</p>
<p>The matter of allocating coal briquettes to workers was also mentioned at yesterday's meeting. Some committee members believed that the Food Allocation Committee should only handle food and should not be responsible for allocating coal briquettes. Wu Kaixian believed that the Allocation Committee has already handled the allocation of rice and oil to workers, so it seems easy to handle, and the allocation of coal briquettes is for cooking, so it seems that the Allocation Committee can still be responsible. No final decision has been made on this matter, but in principle, it will generally be handled by the Food Allocation Committee.</p>
<h3>"Quanhe" Supply and Marketing Cooperative Increases Allocation of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Ministry of Social Affairs has expanded the in-kind allocation for public education staff in order to effectively improve the lives of public education staff. In addition to the six kinds of daily necessities allocated to public education staff by the government, it plans to increase the allocation of six kinds of daily necessities such as towels, socks, shirts, and undershirts. It will be piloted in Nanjing and Shanghai first, and then promoted to other provinces and cities after it is effective. Regarding the funding, it will be passed by the Four Banks Joint Office and handled by the representative of the Central Cooperative Bank. The cotton gauze raw materials will be supplied by the China Textile Company, and production is currently being stepped up. It may be possible to first allocate and sell several items such as shirts next month. As for the allocation method, the cooperative has formulated detailed methods and will invite representatives from 11 units such as the Central Cooperative Bank and the China Textile Company to form a review committee to preside over matters such as pricing and distribution. All public education staff in Nanjing and Shanghai who are allocated firewood, rice, and other six kinds of in-kind goods can be issued a purchase certificate by the cooperative every month or every quarter to purchase goods at a specified cooperative.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan Explains His Powers Again; Criticizes Parents of Arrested Students as Unwise</h3>
<p>Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, made a statement on the matter of the families of arrested students filing an appeal with the High Court, explaining the imposition of martial law in this city. Yesterday, the families of the arrested students responded to Xuan's statement, and Xuan explained the powers of martial law again. His words are as follows: The martial law implemented by this headquarters is not the temporary martial law stipulated in Article 3 of the Martial Law Act. If it is temporary, this headquarters may announce it at any time without special approval. The procedure is only to submit it to the National Government for retroactive recognition. The beginning of martial law in this city was reported by the former headquarters to the former Military Council for approval, and the Military Council forwarded it to the National Government, which approved the implementation of martial law. More than a year has passed, and the martial law has not been lifted. Moreover, because the situation in this city is unstable and there are many incidents around, this headquarters has not considered lifting martial law in order to protect the safety of more than four million citizens. This legal and factual basis cannot be shaken by argument. As for the provision in Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution that the person should be transferred to the judicial organ for trial within 24 hours at the latest, the article clearly stipulates that it only refers to the organ that executes the arrest or detention, not the organ that has the power to prosecute. Otherwise, the suspects investigated by the prosecutor must also be transferred to the criminal court within 24 hours. Moreover, the Provisional Constitution was promulgated and implemented on June 1, 1931, and the Martial Law Act was promulgated on November 29, 1934. The habeas corpus began to be implemented on March 15 of last year. If it is believed that martial law is in conflict with the Provisional Constitution, then why did the National Government promulgate laws that conflict with the Provisional Constitution that was implemented three years ago, and wait for the Habeas Corpus Act that was implemented twelve years later to remedy it? The parents' unfounded reliance on Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution as the reason for the habeas corpus is even more wrong. In short, the powers of this headquarters to investigate military personnel related to military affairs in accordance with the Martial Law Act are clearly stipulated in the law, and cannot be arbitrarily abandoned by non-military organs, let alone be required to be abandoned by the people. Moreover, after the communist party's underground work program was uncovered, it was discovered that many of the arrested elements were instigated by the communist party, shouting slogans, posting slogans everywhere, opposing conscription and grain requisition, and inciting strikes and markets. Their performance corresponded to the communist army that advocated rebellion. It is a well-known and undeniable fact. The parents are defending their children and do not hesitate to quote out of context and distort the law in an attempt to confuse the hearing. This is the most unwise thing.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Association to Elect Flower Queen</h3>
<p>The Relief Committee for the Flood in Guangdong and Guangxi has launched a fundraising campaign. It is reported that in addition to deciding to issue disaster relief lottery tickets, the committee plans to hold an election for "Flower Queen" in order to call on citizens from all walks of life to actively donate and not forget disaster relief during entertainment. It is predicted that the grand occasion at that time will be no less than the Shanghai Miss election last year.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Bureau Formulates Three Measures for Surplus Distribution of Cooperatives</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The annual surplus of consumer cooperatives should be distributed in proportion to the amount of transactions of the members, after deducting the public reserve fund, public welfare fund, and staff remuneration, according to regulations. The Cooperative Bureau has formulated three measures because various cooperatives often fail to comply with the regulations: (1) Establish a special register to register accounts separately. (2) An invoice should be issued for each transaction, and the calculation should be based on the saved invoices at the end of the year. (3) It should be handled with a transaction manual containing a purchase certificate, and the members should be notified in advance to save a copy. All cooperatives should refer to these measures and implement them from this year.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Reviewing Standards and Methods for Price Allocation of Japanese Compensation Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The "Measures for Private Enterprises to Apply for Price Allocation of Japanese Compensation Materials" have been approved by the Executive Yuan and instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to comply with them. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has instructed its subordinate agencies to comply with them.</p>
<p>The specified review standards are: 1. The applicant has been experienced and successful in operating this industry. 2. The organization is sound and sufficient to be competent. 3. The plan is perfect and feasible. 4. The amount of fundraising can reach the plan. Private enterprises that meet the above items and have the following circumstances will be given priority for price allocation: 1. The applicant has suffered significant losses to the materials to be allocated and purchased during the Anti-Japanese War, and there is factual evidence to prove it. 2. The current business urgently needs replenishment and has been approved by the government. 3. This industry has made significant contributions in the rear area to the materials to be allocated and purchased of the same type of industry and mining.</p>

The court adjourned the hearing to 10:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month for continued hearing.</p>

<h3>Case of Collapsed Wall at Chongshi School: Principal Offers Two Justifications</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The brick wall of the side entrance of Chongshi School at 440 Huangpi South Road suddenly collapsed at 12:30 PM on June 8th, crushing Zhang Daoqing, a worker at the egg roll factory next door, to death. After the police department interrogated Shen Xibin, the school's principal, and Zhang Ding, the mother of the deceased, Shen was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of negligence leading to death due to his failure to repair the wall. Yesterday, Shen submitted a plea to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating two reasons; (1) The Education Bureau stipulates that the school should be repaired every six months, and the school buildings were not damaged, so the responsibility to prevent danger in advance has been fulfilled. (2) The factory next door built a bamboo shed next to the school, and the wall became loose after nails were hammered into it, leading to the collapse. Therefore, the school should not be held responsible for negligence leading to death.</p>

<h3>Robbery with Bloodshed in Yangjiadu, Pudong: Two Shot</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Tian Junfa, a resident of No. 1002 Xiaopudong Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, has been working as a foreman at the Ning Shao Wharf and earns a good monthly income. His wife, Ms. Ni, has one son and one daughter. Around 6 PM the day before yesterday, two robbers suddenly appeared, one wearing a beige raincoat and the other wearing a black cloak, pacing back and forth at the gate. Tian went out after dark, and the two robbers broke into the house, threatening with guns. As a result, they robbed a gold bracelet from Ms. Ni's hand. The robber with the gun went first, and the robber without a weapon followed. At that time, Ms. Ni refused to be intimidated and twisted the robber behind her, shouting loudly, alarming the neighbors. Xu Wenxian and a young woman, Du Tan, rushed to the scene upon hearing the noise to help Ms. Ni capture the robber. The robber with the gun saw that his companion had not come out, so he turned back and entered the door, and upon seeing the situation, he fired three shots. One bullet hit Xu's right thigh, and another bullet hit Du's abdomen. Both fell to the ground with a thud, bleeding profusely. The robbers eventually escaped with the stolen goods. Later, the Yangjing Police Sub-bureau sent police to investigate and sent the injured men and women to the Municipal Third Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicles Prohibited on Certain Bridges, Pedicabs Dispersed to Suburbs, Improving Traffic in Central District, Review Meeting Held</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] A review meeting to improve traffic in the central district of the city was held in the city government conference room at 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Mayor Wu. After the Public Utilities Bureau, Police Bureau, and Public Works Bureau reported separately, the following resolutions were made on the spot:</p>
<p>(1) It is stipulated that a license for a motor vehicle will only be issued if there is a parking space. (2) Unlicensed pedicabs and rickshaws will be auctioned off by vehicle dealers from other places, and the proceeds will be returned to the original owners. The detailed methods will be discussed by the municipal government meeting and then submitted to the Municipal Council for approval. (3) The Shanghai Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang believes that bridge traffic is congested, and motor vehicles should be prohibited from passing through certain bridges, while rickshaws can pass through at will, to benefit the common people. Because motor vehicles are highly maneuverable and convenient, and the time and gasoline required to take detours are negligible, the above proposal was approved in principle. Now that the Shanxi Road Bridge has been repaired and the Fujian Road Bridge will also be completed, it is decided that these two bridges will be exclusively for rickshaw traffic.</p>
<p>Ten-Wheel Trucks to be Equipped with Iron Nets</p>
<p>(4) Ten-wheel trucks are most likely to cause accidents because their lower bodies are very high and there are no covers on the left and right sides. If people are knocked down and fall under the truck, there is no escape. It is decided that truck owners or users should install wire mesh on the left and right sides of the trucks as soon as possible as a barrier. It is also stipulated that vehicles without this equipment will be banned, and strict enforcement will be carried out during vehicle inspection and licensing. (5) In order to solve the traffic congestion in the central district, it is decided to draw lots to move the existing pedicabs to the suburbs. Vehicles that win the lot will be allowed to continue to operate throughout the city, but they must repaint their bodies yellow and their canopies gray within a limited time, and they will only be allowed to operate after their equipment has been inspected and approved.</p>
<p>Horns Used to Summon People Should be Banned</p>
<p>(6) Citizens are disgusted with car horns at night, so special measures are stipulated to ban them. In addition, most cars use horns as a tool to summon people, which is fundamentally wrong and should also be banned. (7) The Municipal Council previously sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau stating that parking signs have not been widely erected, causing drivers to be at a loss as to where to park, and the Cao traffic police often impose penalties, which seems unfair. It was resolved that the enforcement of traffic fines should be temporarily suspended until the signs are widely erected, but it was resolved that fines should still be imposed.</p>
<p>Setting up Command Platforms and Building Safety Islands</p>
<p>(8) On Nanjing Road from Xizang Road to the Bund, cars are not allowed to obstruct the width of the tram line between 8 AM and 6 PM every day. If they violate the regulations, they will be punished according to the traffic rules. If accidents occur, the car drivers will be fully responsible. It is decided that the Garrison Command, Military Police, and Police Bureau will each send representatives to maintain traffic order at all times. (9) In order to improve traffic congestion in the central district, it is stipulated that vehicles on north-south roads are only allowed to park facing east, and vehicles on east-west roads are only allowed to park facing south. (10) It is decided to set up fixed traffic control platforms at the following locations: (A) The intersection of the Bund and Nanjing Road, (B) The intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Henan Road, (C) The intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, (D) The intersection of Zhongshan East Road and Suzhou Road (i.e., the foot of the Waibaidu Bridge). It is decided to build a safety island at the intersection of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road to prevent traffic confusion and obstruction of traffic order. The conference believes that most of the traffic improvement work is of a technical nature, and in order to facilitate discussions and decisions during the meeting and to make full use of expert opinions, it is decided to set up six specialized working groups to conduct regular research.</p>

<h3>Private Schools in Northeastern Shanghai Tentatively Set Tuition Standards</h3>
<p>300,000 for Elementary School, 450,000 for Junior High</p>

Member schools included Shenpei, Dalu, Youheng, Nianhua, Ronghai, Sigaoli, Zhonghua Girls' Elementary School, and Qinghua, totaling 135 schools. Zhu Junti, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Liu Xunshou, Head of the Private School Section, attended the meeting and gave instructions. Wang Shiying, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by a discussion of the proposals. It was resolved that: (1) Only a few schools in the district have not yet registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. If the procedures are legal, the Education Bureau will be asked to approve the registration leniently. (2) The schools in the district are located in factory areas, and the tuition fees are extremely low. The equipment cannot be compared with general central schools. The Education Bureau will be asked to appropriately lower the equipment standards for schools in the district. (3) Currently, more and more parents are going to various schools to inquire about tuition fees for the next semester. In order to make it clear to parents, it is proposed to temporarily set the following tuition standards for the next semester: at least 300,000 yuan for elementary school, 450,000 yuan for junior high school, and 600,000 yuan for senior high school, not including textbooks and miscellaneous fees.

<h3>Many Cases of Forged Documents Discovered During National Education Certification Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is holding a certification examination for national school teachers this year, originally planned for 5,000 people. Since the start of the process, the application forms prepared have been almost completely issued in just three days. The bureau is now rushing to print more. Distribution has been temporarily suspended from today and will resume on the 23rd. Also, many forged graduation certificates and service certificates have been submitted in the past three days. Among the more serious cases, Wang Shucheng and Sun Shuying forged the seal of the county government. There were also two people who forged the seal of the former Shanghai County Rural Normal School. Yao Jinggao, deputy director of the Certification Committee and head of the registration team, told reporters: Forging documents is a violation of criminal law and constitutes the crime of forging official documents, with a minimum sentence of one year. However, in consideration of the first offense, we will not pursue the matter. If it is discovered again in the future, it will definitely be transferred to the judicial authorities for handling in accordance with the law. If anyone has submitted forged documents, we hope that they will confess themselves immediately and they will be treated leniently.</p>
<h3>Textbook Shortage Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>National Standard Textbooks Proposed to be Abolished</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] Since the copyright of national standard textbooks was opened, many houses have requested to print them, but in fact, almost none have submitted samples and published books. Several book industry typesetting joint ventures in Shanghai are said to have invested a total of only 600 million yuan, which is like a drop in the bucket compared to the total national demand of 100 billion yuan, and cannot actually help. Moreover, there are no branches in various places, making it even more difficult to supply them in abundance. Those with a shortage of funds have collected deposit fees at low prices, stipulating that the books will be delivered in early this month, but due to the soaring prices of raw materials and printing, the funds have long been used for other purposes. Therefore, the books cannot be delivered on time, and disputes have arisen repeatedly. Local governments are frantically inquiring with Nanjing and Shanghai about what is going on. In the market, except for Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Jiaotong, Children's, Chinese Culture, Independent, Victory and other eleven companies, which continue to supply a considerable quantity, other versions are only seen in advertisements, and are rarely found in reality. The textbook shortage this autumn will inevitably be extremely serious.</p>
<p>[Another News] According to a certain educator: No matter how revised, national standard textbooks are ultimately deemed to be outdated and unusable. The institutions that are currently printing these national standard textbooks are unrestricted. Individuals, groups, institutions, and ordinary printing houses, regardless of whether they have storefronts or distribution centers in various places, can apply for printing, as if it were a perpetual calendar that everyone can print. This is a case of everyone following suit, causing extreme disruption. The quantity cannot be estimated, and the distribution network cannot be widespread. At a time when the country is poor and the people are distressed, it seems inappropriate to take such an "annoying" and wasteful action. It would be more reasonable to abolish these national standard textbooks that only cause disruption as soon as possible and allow bookstores to freely print approved versions.</p>

Li, Ju, and Zhang showed their prowess, returning the favor in kind, tying the score at 3-3. In the final match, no one from Shanghai Star was able to play, so they forfeited. Post Office Team A thus won unexpectedly with a score of 4-3. Shanghai Star was careless and was defeated in Mai City. The results are as follows:</p>

Haiying's right to compete should be revoked, Xinsheng's protest is upheld, and the deposit is returned.</p>
<p>(2) The Post Office Team B basketball team of Group B expressed dissatisfaction with the game after the finals against Xianshi, but since no protest was filed according to the rules and false advertisements were published, which violated the spirit of sportsmanship, a warning should be issued.</p>
<p>Today, two Group B basketball games will be held to compete for the right to reach the finals, and the finals will be held this weekend. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Xianshi — (Pingguang (Replay) 6:15 PM</p>

<h3>Dong Shouyi's Trip to Europe</h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng and Wu Yunrui Requested to Submit a Report</p>
<p>[Guoguang News Agency, Nanjing] It has been learned that Mr. Dong Shouyi, China's representative to the Olympic World Sports Committee meeting in Sweden, has flown from England to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. The sports community is shocked that Dong requested that the 1956 World Games be held in Beiping, China. The All-China Sports Federation believes that this matter is of great importance. Executive Directors Wu Yunrui and Hao Gengsheng and others have jointly sent a letter to Dong. A reporter from Guoguang News Agency obtained a copy of the original letter, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Dong's Trip to Europe: No Resolution from the Council</p>
<p>"Brother Shouyi, greetings: This time you went to Europe to attend the preparatory meeting of the World Games in the name of representing the All-China Sports Federation, but in reality, you represent the Republic of China, which is of great importance. However, the decision to go was made entirely through private agreement between individuals, without any basis in the resolution of the Council meeting. This is ridiculous. If the people of the country were to learn of this inside story, not only would the members of the Council of the Sports Federation be criticized, but you personally would also be despised by the people of the country. We feel that this matter is inappropriate and dare not remain silent. We hereby ask you to pay attention to this matter and convene a Council meeting as soon as possible to report on the situation and results of your attendance in order to remedy the situation. This matter concerns the All-China Sports Federation and your personal future. Please pay attention to it. Best wishes, Hao Gengsheng and Wu Yunrui, together."</p>
<h3>US Navy Swimming Preliminary Trials: Continue This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Results of the Five Preliminary Events Yesterday Were Average</p>
<p>The US Navy's Western Pacific US Military Swimming Preliminary Trials, hosted by the US Navy authorities in this city, were held at the French Club swimming pool on Maoming Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Athletes from all over gathered, but since there were only five preliminary events yesterday, the atmosphere was not very lively. Those invited from the sports community to serve as referees, timers, and starters included Jin Zhaojun, Jiang Xiangqing, Wu Bangwei, Qian Yiqin, Liang Zhaoan, and Lu Xiangqian.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM sharp, starter Jiang Xiangqing took the stage. The first event was the 1,500-meter race. There were only two competitors, Huarilun Te and Boklun, both from the Mariana Islands. After the starting gun fired, the competition began. The two followed each other closely. At 300 meters, Huarilun Te took the lead by 50 meters. Boklun tried hard to catch up, but ultimately lacked experience and gradually fell behind. When Huarilun Te reached the finish line, Boklun was about 100 meters behind.

<h3>Implementation Plan for Regulating the Gauze Market: Submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval Today</h3>
<p>Establish Guangzhou Office to Eliminate Gauze Smuggling</p>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The sixth regular meeting of the Textile Regulation Committee was held at the committee's conference room yesterday afternoon from 4:30 PM. Deputy Chairman Liu Siying and ten other people attended, and the meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM. The main points of the discussion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the implementation plan for developing the textile industry and regulating the gauze market, some of the details have been revised and finalized. Deputy Chairman Liu will take them to Beijing today and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval before being announced and implemented. (2) In order to completely eliminate the smuggling of gauze to Nanyang, the committee decided to first establish a branch office in Guangzhou. The person in charge of the office has been internally determined. It was also decided to first send personnel to the Guangzhou area to inspect the production, sales, and smuggling situation of gauze in the area. (3) The replication industry in this city requested to improve the current method of allocating yarn. After discussion, it was considered that the method of allocating yarn to the replication industry in this city does need to be improved, and the yarn allocation of the replication industry in other places also needs to be considered. It was decided to first hand it over to the committee's business office to study the method, and then submit it to the committee for discussion. (4) The Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District requested to improve the grading standards for cotton yarn purchases. According to the current standards, there are five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. Only those classified as Grade A are considered qualified, and the standard seems to be too high. It was requested to change it to Grade C or above to be considered qualified. It was decided to transfer it to the committee's technical office to discuss with the Sixth District Association for handling. (5) Regarding the negotiated price of cotton yarn, it was decided not to adjust it in the short term.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Deputy Chairman Liu to reporters: Regarding the allocation of yarn to distributors, there are clear regulations in the implementation plan for gauze regulation, and it is also intended to allocate according to the plan. It can be implemented once it is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Oversupply: Market Transactions Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday, Meiya replaced Yongsai, followed by Xinhuo and Jingfu. Off-site credit is still tight, and those active outside the industry are unable to move forward. People within the industry are gradually disappointed and are closing out their positions, forming an oversupply. Spot market sentiment is depressed, and transactions are sharply reduced. Swap arbitrage is decreasing, and it is difficult for the banking sector to find counterparts for funds. The interest rate has been reduced to less than 1.2%, half the rate of the off-site black market. People's hearts are not encouraged. Except for miscellaneous brands, underwear, and semi-cooked French Xinhua, which saw a slight increase, all stocks were generally unhappy. Xinhuo's current and forward prices fell to the limit, and Shangwu Cement also stopped falling, making the overall situation difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was still stable. The forward Meiya opened high to 620 yuan, a difference of as much as 50 yuan from the spot Meiya, which attracted arbitrageurs to increase supply. This forced the spot and forward Meiya down to 565 yuan and 588 yuan. No. 231 and No. 146 sold the spot and forward Xinhuo, which also fell to 3680 yuan and 3850 yuan. At 9:30 AM, No. 35, No. 97, and No. 223 came in to buy Meiya, and No. 185 and No. 152 came in to buy Xinhuo, and there was a rebound. Shangwu was first listed low to the limit by No. 142 Shoughuag at 9:40 AM, and No. 89, No. 69, No. 4, No. 224 still sold, and finally it was unsustainable. After 10:00 AM, it was heard that the investigation of walkie-talkies in the building became stricter, and people were very afraid. Meiya was forced down to 520 yuan (spot) and 546 yuan (forward), a low price. Xinhuo fell to 3500 yuan, the limit of the fall. At 10:20 AM, No. 197, No. 226, No. 106, and No. 14 bought in at low prices. Meiya rebounded to around 545 yuan and 565 yuan, and Cement was listed by No. 149 to the limit of the fall.

At 12:00 PM, Meiya rebounded to around 557 yuan and 578 yuan, and Xinhuo rebounded to above 5700 yuan and 5600 yuan. Forward Xinguang rose to 205 yuan, and Jingfu rose to above 172 yuan. No. 224, No. 157, No. 97, and No. 235 sold Meiya, No. 163 sold Xinhuo, No. 112 sold Xinguang, and all three popular stocks had a small decline and ended in a flat market. However, the forward Meiya closed as high as 572 yuan. No. 223 and others closed out, and there was a slight shout down after the close. The remaining stocks were still relatively stable. The result was that the spot stock Xinhuo fell to the limit and then rebounded, falling by less than half. Huafeng fell by a weak 10%, and Xinguang, Jingfu, Meiya, Dongxing, and Yonggong each fell by about 5%. Zhongfa Xinhua still had a slight increase, Guohuo Lian was the only one that was flat, underwear rose by a weak 50%, Shangwu Cement fell to the limit and then rebounded, the former fell by a weak 50%, the latter fell by less than half, and the rest had slight declines. Forward stocks fell by a strong 50% after Xinhuo fell to the limit and rebounded, Huafeng fell by 50%, and Xinguang and Yonggong Jingfu fell slightly. Meiya was the only one that was flat, and Qinxing fell by a strong 50%. Off-site old stocks Nanyang Zhonghua Wuzhou rebounded slightly by half, and the rest were flat and tired.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Trading Concentrated in Meiya</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading yesterday was concentrated in Meiya. The premium continued to deteriorate, and the spot market lacked activity. Banks were unable to find a way out. No. 2207, No. 110, No. 181, No. 45, and No. 155 and others bought in, and Meiya fell from 25 yuan to 14 yuan at the close. The interest rate fell from 1.9% to around 1.1%.

At the same time, new stocks also opened, initially opening at 205 yuan, falling to 185 yuan, and finally at 200 yuan to 205 yuan, which was forward delivery.

<h3>Export Tax Problem Solved for Silk Fabrics Intended for India</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] China's silk production cannot match overseas market prices in terms of cost, resulting in sluggish sales. Since Hugh White, a silk expert from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, conducted inspections in various regions, he has drafted a plan to recommend that the authorities develop new avenues for raw materials, weaving silk fabrics, and promote them to India to compete for overseas sales of Chinese silk fabrics. At the same time, labor fees can also be exchanged for foreign exchange. The relevant departments organized a silk weaving management and guidance committee to be responsible for supervision. Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Company jointly with various silk weaving factories obtained 2,200 dan of raw silk and 2,400 boxes of rayon from China Trust Bureau in accordance with the prescribed procedures, and started weaving silk fabrics for export. It is expected that 110,000 pieces of silk fabrics for export can be produced by the end of August. According to the current overseas market price, the total value can reach 6 million US dollars. According to the cost of living index, the estimated labor cost is 60 billion national currency. As of the end of last month, 62,000 pieces of finished products have been shipped to Mumbai. The reason for the delayed transaction is that our side insisted on paying taxes based on the export valuation, while the other side insisted on paying taxes based on the local market price. After further negotiations, a compromise was reached. The first three batches of goods will be taxed entirely according to our country's export valuation, and the rest will be valued according to the local market price. This news was reported here yesterday by our representative in India.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association: Meeting Today of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>Review Proposals from the 14th General Assembly</p>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The 14th General Assembly of the Bankers and Commercial Association of this city has been scheduled for the 26th of this month at the City Chamber of Commerce. The association has now received more than ten proposals from member banks, most of which are opinions on revising the association's rules. In order to organize the proposals in advance, the association decided to hold a meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM today to conduct a preliminary review of the proposals at the same time. It is reported that there are currently 142 members of the association. Member representatives are dispatched according to the size of their capital, with a maximum of seven people and a minimum of one person, for a total of 431 people.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Plans to Manufacture Jute Bags: Monthly Output of Approximately 200,000 Bags</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The China Textile Construction Company's First Jute Mill is currently planning to produce 200,000 jute bags per month due to the shortage of jute bags in the country and the strong demand. It is now heard that the production of yellow jute in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area is quite abundant, and the price is also reasonable. It is planned to purchase it for future use.</p>
<h3>Steel Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant: Request for Details on Japanese Machinery</h3>
<p>[This newspaper read] The preparatory work for the Joint Steel Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant, which plans to use Japanese reparations equipment, is actively underway. Recently, the convener of the plant submitted a document to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, stating that the manufacture of steel ball bearings is very complicated, and the equipment of machine tools is different from ordinary machines. The manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States and Japan are different. The Japanese reparations equipment list in the past only included the quantity of machines, without specifying their parts, performance, and working procedures; therefore, four requests were specially made and transferred to the delegation in Japan for handling: (1) The name of the machine to be dismantled, the weight of each machine, and the horsepower required. (2) Whether there is any damage to all machines to be dismantled. (3) The layout of the original factory and plant in Japan for the bearing factory should be immediately displayed. (4) The name of the products produced by the factory in the past and the maximum production capacity, and the working procedures adopted. In addition to these four requests, it is hoped that personnel will be sent to Japan for on-site inspections.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Purchasing Cased Tea: Approved for Extension by Five Days</h3>
<p>In the case of the tea loan in the 35th year of the Republic of China, the method of handling the pledged cased tea was that the Four Joint Offices previously stated that tea merchants borrowed money from national banks and bureaus to purchase tea and pledge it for nearly a year. The board of directors has now decided that China Trust Bureau will purchase all of the tea based on the domestic tea prices proposed by the tea merchants, with a deadline of July 20. Now the tea merchants have requested to increase the purchase price. The department has now submitted a proposal for discussion. It is generally believed that the government's assistance to tea merchants in purchasing, transporting, and selling tea has given the tea merchants the greatest convenience. The amount of the past pledge loans has been repeatedly increased, and the tea merchants have already recovered their capital. The currently set purchase price is also based on the requests made by the tea merchants in May. This time, they have repeatedly requested to increase the price, which is excessive. It was decided yesterday that the request could not be granted, but the deadline for purchase was extended to July 25.</p>
<h3>Rayon Factory: Too Much Capital Required, Construction Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] According to the person in charge of the Rayon Association in this city, it is quite difficult for our country to build a rayon factory by itself because too much capital is required. For example, building a factory with a daily output of ten tons of rayon requires a capital of ten million US dollars. When a representative of a major US rayon factory came to Shanghai a month ago, they discussed the matter of building a factory in China with a certain industrial magnate in our country. The terms of cooperation were that the US party would supply the equipment, and the Chinese businessmen would raise five million US dollars as construction costs and working capital. Due to practical difficulties, it was not fully negotiated. In the past, Japan had a rayon factory in Andong, with a monthly output of 25 tons. The Textile Construction Company originally planned to move this factory south and start work in Shanghai in July. However, the situation in Northeast China changed several times, and the factory suffered heavy losses. In the end, only 15 trucks of equipment were transported out, so this relocation plan has become a pipe dream. Taking this city's rayon market as an example, when the Qianlun is scheduled, it will bring back more than 1,000 boxes of rayon. The current market price has fallen slightly, and the selling price per box is about 27 million yuan. In the future, after Japan's trade is opened, there will be more sources, and the price may fall. Before the war, the selling price of rayon per box was about 120 yuan, and the city's monthly demand at that time was about 8,000 boxes. At the end of last year, the rayon price was about 3 million per box, and the city's demand was about 4,000 boxes. Now the selling price has approached 30 million, and the demand has been reduced to about 2,000 boxes per month.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Tons of Coal from Qinhuangdao Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Fuel Committee recently dispatched the giant ships Tangshan and Hange Maler to Qinhuangdao to load coal, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The amount of coal loaded by each ship was very large. It is estimated that the Tangshan carried 7,000 tons of lump coal, and the Hange Maler carried 7,300 tons of coal dust. After unloading the goods within a few days, the two ships will continue to transport coal to Qinhuangdao. In addition, a large amount of coal from the Keelung coal mine in Taiwan will also be transported to Shanghai, and the committee has sent ships to load it.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth All Stop Falling and Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was still weak at the opening, but because the overnight price fell too much, credit became loose, the market was in a buying mood, and there was active buying. The market turned from weak to strong. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 1 million yuan, to 18.2 million yuan, because there were more transactions, Double Horse 20-count was 11.8 million, up 600,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn also rose by 800,000 yuan, to 10.8 million yuan. Other thick and thin yarns, such as 42-count Bao Guang Shui Yue, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Blue Phoenix, 20-count Big Woman Bell, 16-count Guangming Red Bee, and 10-count Italian Zi Jun, also rebounded by 400,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market also saw easing credit, and retail investors and industry insiders bought in at low prices. Buyers also placed orders to supplement their inventory, and the market stopped falling and rebounded. As a result of the closing, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head cloth rose by 10,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 428,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth, such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yang Crane, also rose by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. The demand for Four Gentlemen and Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance fabrics was quite strong, and the price rose by 10,000 to 16,000 yuan. The remaining raw cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth remained at the original price.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market is still strong internally and externally, except for summer goods. Most of them are moving towards their peak. However, the turnover is very sluggish, because those with strength have already absorbed a considerable amount in the previous two weeks. The prices of autumn and winter woolen fabrics continue to rise, increasing the cost, and those who want to purchase are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Surge in Prices of Tallow, a Major Soap Raw Material</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of tallow, a major raw material for soap and candles, has risen sharply, significantly impacting the cost of soap production. Yesterday, a reporter visited authoritative figures in the industry, who said that the main production areas of tallow are Hankou, Jingzhou, Lanxi, and Jiaxing, with Hankou being the largest distribution center. In the past month, the amount of tallow shipped from various production areas to Shanghai has been extremely small because the inventory in the production areas is also becoming increasingly scarce. Furthermore, large soap factories in Shanghai with greater financial resources are also going to the production areas to purchase directly, which has also made local tallow prices very buoyant. Currently, Hankou tallow is priced at 1.4 million yuan per picul (司馬担), which is comparable to prices in Shanghai. Moreover, daily telegrams continue to report rising prices. Shanghai tallow merchants believe that with Shanghai and production area prices being equal, the high transportation costs, and the high exchange rate in Hankou, they are unwilling to go to purchase tallow without any profit to be made. Additionally, due to the hot weather, the demand for soap in the Shanghai market is relatively strong, and many factories have increased production, so tallow sales are indeed booming. In this situation of supply falling short of demand, rising prices are inevitable, which is completely opposite to the phenomenon of oversupply and falling prices this spring. They also stated that although the asking price for tallow has been high recently, the market transactions have been very limited, and the thinness of funds in the market is the main reason. Even those holding inventory are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, as new tallow will not be available until after autumn.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices, Initially Firm, Then Level; Slight Rise in High-Quality White Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received more than 7,000 shih (石) of rice. The market conditions were firm in the morning and leveled off in the afternoon. High-quality japonica and indica rice slightly rose by 3000 to 5000 yuan, while medium and low-quality rice remained stable. There was little change in white rice.</p>
<p>After continuous declines, wheat flour rebounded by 2000 to 3000 yuan, but the market was still sluggish at the close, and the momentum for further increases appeared weak. Oil cakes and miscellaneous grains declined across the board. Soybean cakes were selling very slowly and continued to fall by 2000 to 3000 yuan. Yingkou cakes also fell by 3000 to 4000 yuan. Wheat bran fell by 1000 to 2000 yuan. Soybean sales were stagnant, and prices fell again by 5000 to 10000 yuan. Southern soybeans were weak and gradually declined, dropping by 10000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to decline, falling another 10000 yuan. Sesame sales were also sluggish, and prices continued to plummet by 10000 to 20000 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn from Northern ports has ceased trading, falling back by 3000 to 5000 yuan. Broad beans had sluggish sales, showing signs of decline, and fell by another 2000 to 3000 yuan. Field peas were stable. The oil market declined in a straight line. Soybean oil fell again by 10000 to 20000 yuan, sesame oil fell sharply by 30000 to 40000 yuan, rapeseed oil plummeted by 30000 to 40000 yuan, and clear oil also fell by 20000 to 30000 yuan. Raw oil also fell by slightly under 10000 yuan. With trading from other ports suspended, the local market is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Argentine Rice Grain Temporarily Cannot Be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] He Molin, manager of the Materials Exchange Office of the Central Trust Bureau, went to Argentina at the beginning of this year to assist the Chinese Embassy in Argentina in negotiating trade barter between China and Argentina. He has now returned to Shanghai after six months. It is reported that the China-Argentina trade was originally intended to take the form of barter trade, but the Argentine government hopes to increase exports, especially rice and grain exports. Currently, an agreement on prices has not yet been reached, so Argentine rice cannot be shipped to China for the time being. In addition, on his way back to China, Mr. He inspected the bureau's procurement operations in the United States. The general impression is that it was quite good.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Exports Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market for green teas such as Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei remained sluggish due to imbalanced inventory adjustments. However, Wuchang Tea Company continued to absorb Qimen old tea and low-grade black tea, and the trend was driven by sellers' intentions, with consistent vigor. For various domestic sales, although local shops and traveling merchants had some interest, they were all waiting and watching due to the influence of the Ming Ying compilation, and the number of transactions sharply decreased, but the situation was still stable. According to industry insiders, new Qimen black tea for this year has recently arrived from the Anhui Tea Company, etc., but because the production cost is very high, the asking price is staggering, reportedly reaching around 3 million yuan per dan, and it is still unknown whether it can be sold smoothly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Tianxiang Foreign Company's Tei Hai Lan Tai ship, carrying more than 220 tons of tea, and the Baohe Dehang's Laukesmi ship, carrying more than 200 tons, both left Shanghai yesterday for Europe.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Committee Discusses Silk and Tea Export Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held consecutive meetings on the 15th and 16th, chaired by Chen Guangfu, to study the export issues of tea and raw silk in detail. Although several conclusions have been reached in principle, the technical implementation issues still need to be further planned, so no resolution was made immediately. As for the improvement measures for the purchase of tung oil and pig bristles, they are currently being submitted to the Bristle Subcommittee of the committee for research at the request of various exporters. It is said that improvements are expected in the purchase method and price.</p>
<h3>Musk Cannot Be Exported; Domestic and Foreign Prices Are Inverted</h3>
<p>Musk from Kang and Shu provinces is generally bartered for rice and tea locally. However, recently, affected by the sharp rise in rice and tea prices in the local area, the purchase price of musk has also gradually increased. Musk from Kang Province was once sold well in countries such as Britain and France, while musk from Shu Province was only sold to the domestic medicinal materials industry. Therefore, there are fewer buyers for the latter. It is said that there is quite a lot of musk arriving in Shanghai currently, but it cannot be exported because the difference between domestic and foreign market prices is too large. Currently, the selling price is about 8 million yuan per catty, while the recent foreign market price is less than 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Committees to Be Considered for Merger by the National Economic Council</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council is currently considering merging the Import Control Committee and the Export Promotion Committee. Since their establishment, the two committees have made remarkable achievements in promoting China's international trade. The National Economic Council intends to strengthen the connection and effectiveness of import and export, so it has the intention to merge them.</p>
<h3>Representatives Designated for Various Units of the South China Import and Export Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that since the South China Import and Export Management Committee was approved for establishment, it has been actively preparing and has now formed ten units. The representatives of each unit have also been designated and are expected to be formally established soon.</p>
<p>Raw Pencil Leads Still Permitted for Import</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Major pencil manufacturers in Shanghai previously requested the Non-Quota Allocation Office of the Import Control Committee to allow the import of special pencils made abroad, which cannot be manufactured domestically. It is now learned that the request has been rejected. However, it is said that raw pencil leads are still permitted to be imported as usual.</p>
<h3>Match Industry Lacks Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Proposed Request to Import Control Committee to Increase Import Volume</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the match industry in Shanghai is currently feeling the crisis of a lack of raw materials deeply. The main raw materials for matches are red phosphorus and potassium chlorate, which are listed as Class II chemicals in the list of commodities under import control. However, the import quota for chemical raw materials in the first quarter of this year was only 800,000 US dollars, and only over 7,000 US dollars were allocated for the above two raw materials. Among this amount, part needs to be allocated to chemical raw material merchants, so the number that manufacturers can obtain is very small. Although the Ordnance Department of our country can self-produce red phosphorus and potassium chlorate, its own needs are very large and it has no surplus capacity to supply civilian factories. The total amount of raw materials required by the match factories in Shanghai for the whole year is about 4 million US dollars, and the current quota is far from the actual needs, so except for a few large factories with particularly large inventories, most match factories cannot maximize their production capacity. It is now reported that the match industry plans to negotiate with the Import Control Committee to remove these two essential raw materials from the list of Class II chemicals, so that the import volume can be increased to meet the legitimate needs of various factories. In addition to the lack of raw materials, the increase in wages also makes manufacturers feel heavily burdened. In terms of sales, there are no imported goods, and relief supplies are rarely seen in the market. In the past, the domestic sales market in South China was supplied by Shanghai, but recently matches from Guangdong have been found in the market, although not in large quantities. The main reason for the sales from South to North is that raw materials are easier to obtain in South China, so the cost is lower than in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with firm sentiment, and asking prices immediately showed strength. Rumors of advantageous buying circulated in the market, and demand from all sides was strong. It was also rumored that the Yi Zhong Company would stop distributing goods before the tax increase, and the amount of inventory on the market was insufficient. There were more buyers than sellers, and the market sentiment soared. As a result, ten boxes of British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by 260,000 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 8.7 million yuan. Old Gold also continued to rise by 170,000 yuan, reaching 7.55 million yuan. Among Chinese cigarettes, the sales of the Beauty brand were relatively strong, with each carton rising by a huge 3,700 yuan. Other brands such as Golden Mouse, Crest, Three Cats, Bank, and Brandy mostly followed suit, rising by 300 to 1,300 yuan. However, American goods such as Camel, Six, Morris, and tin-packaged cigarettes remained stable.</p>
<h3>Fir Wood Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fir wood market was slightly firm and stable. Large pieces were difficult to obtain at 2,700 yuan. The foreign pine market showed signs of weakness.</p>
<h3>Towel, Blanket, and Other Industries Call For Restrictions on Cotton Textile Imports</h3>
<p>In mid-next month, Japan will open up foreign trade and ship large quantities of manufactured industrial products to our country. People in our industrial sector have unanimously expressed their opposition, and the Import Control Committee has stated that materials outside of quotas are absolutely prohibited from being imported. However, the Shanghai Towel, Blanket, and Cotton Textile Industries Associations believe that the current import and export trade interim measures Appendix 4 only lists silk fabrics as prohibited imports and does not list cotton fabrics. Therefore, according to this regulation of the Import Control Committee, Japanese cotton fabrics may still be dumped in China. Judging from the current domestic cotton textile production situation, there is a surplus in addition to self-sufficiency, which can be shipped to the South Seas Islands without relying on foreign goods. Moreover, in terms of the post-war monetary system, Japan's degree of currency inflation is far less than that of our country, so both labor and material costs are cheaper than in our country. Once a large amount of dumping occurs, it will be difficult to resist. Our towel and blanket industry will have no room for survival, and hundreds of thousands of workers will face unemployment. Therefore, the associations have jointly appealed to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that cotton products be added to the list of prohibited imports to prevent Japanese dumping.</p>

<h3>Science and Superstition Are Mutually Exclusive</h3>
<p>— Bing Li</p>
<p>Before the Dragon Boat Festival, someone wrote to suggest: Imitating the method of designating "Qingming Festival" as "Arbor Day" the year before, they also advocated designating the fifth day of the fifth lunar month as "Epidemic Prevention Day." The reasons were three: First, every family in the mainland must paste a "Talisman for Expelling Plague and Preventing Epidemics" sent from the City God Temple on the main beam of the house on May 5th. This is tantamount to reminding people to pay attention to summer hygiene; otherwise, they are prone to being infected by the plague and becoming ill. If we put aside superstitious beliefs in gods and ghosts, pasting it on the house can be regarded as a warning sign like morning bells and evening drums. Second, there are many seasonal activities on the Dragon Boat Festival, such as pouring realgar wine, which is tantamount to spraying disinfectant; burning Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica, which is tantamount to vaporizing disinfectant; and hanging mugwort leaves, Acorus gramineus, and garlic in front of windows and doorways, which is tantamount to spatial disinfection using volatile agents. These all contain the meaning of indoor disinfection; why don't we promote them and use the existing customs to promote science? Third, seasonal measures are more likely to arouse the interest of the general public compared to all new designs and new initiatives; it will definitely be of great help to the health authorities in implementing policies!</p>
<p>The words are not bad; but the fact is not so. Because old customs contain very strong traditional superstition. Superstition is the enemy of science. Trying to reconcile superstition and science; many people have tried this attempt before, and have repeatedly failed. There is no need to repeat the mistakes in the future, so as not to waste manpower and resources! Starting with summer hygiene: The prevalence of summer diseases is well known to everyone, regardless of age. And the occurrence of the disease is unexpected, and it is also obvious to everyone. It is an indisputable and iron-like fact; but to explain the causes of the disease, not due to the mischief of ghosts and gods, but due to the high temperature and the activity of many seasonal microorganisms; I am afraid no one will easily understand! Then how can we use the old Dragon Boat Festival customs to promote science? In short, science and superstition cannot coexist. To guide science, we must get rid of superstition! Not only those who generally believe that there are plague gods in the world, we must make them understand that the "plague gods" referred to by the ancients are actually the summer sun (referring to heatstroke; that is, what is commonly known as "fasha"; that is, what science calls sunstroke and heatstroke). Those who believe that there are epidemic ghosts in society, we must let them know that the epidemic ghosts referred to by the ancients are actually bacteria (referring to cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery) and protozoa (referring to malaria and relapsing fever); which is impossible in fact! Taking a step back, teaching people to recognize that the five poisons referred to by the ancients may not immediately cause people to become ill; but the five kinds of small creatures that everyone has always considered non-toxic, such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bedbugs, fleas, etc., can often be sufficient to transmit diseases; I am afraid it is not easy! Then, on the Dragon Boat Festival, teaching people not to pour realgar wine, but to pour DDT; not to burn Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica, but to burn sulfur; not to hang mugwort and Acorus gramineus, but to hang deodorizers like those used in modern toilets (commonly known as mothballs); is it feasible? If it doesn't work, then what is the meaning of changing the Dragon Boat Festival to "Epidemic Prevention Day"?</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, education is not universal, and people's wisdom is difficult to enlighten! This is a major prerequisite. If the general level of knowledge of the general public gradually improves, superstition will be defeated without attack; and science will penetrate people's hearts without promotion. But can the education problem be solved overnight? Just like the general public in the current society, have they all undergone modern scientific education? Recently, I saw a letter published in a major newspaper advocating that public vehicles should be disinfected. In particular, rickshaws often carry seriously ill people, which is considered to have a risk of infection; therefore, a request for urgent disinfection was put forward. This proposition is certainly reasonable and deserves everyone's sympathy. However, the article also mentioned that passengers should know how to protect themselves, that is, teaching people to bring Bagua pills when going out. When riding a rickshaw, it is better to hold a corner in your mouth. I really don't know if this article is a disguised advertisement for promoting Bagua pills? If the author is indeed sincere and earnestly promoting hygiene, then the level of scientific knowledge cultivation in advocating that holding Bagua pills in the mouth can prevent infectious diseases can be imagined! I think this person may already know that when going out in summer, you should wear a hat and carry an umbrella to avoid strong sunlight. Also, you should get vaccinations to enhance your resistance to cholera and typhoid fever, so as to avoid accidental infection. However, this article does not mention a single word about this; instead, it mentions holding Bagua pills in the mouth. Isn't it like wishful thinking? The difference is probably due to the superstitious misunderstanding of the five elements and six qi of traditional Chinese medicine; believing that Bagua pills can support righteousness and ward off evil spirits!</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is certainly not right to be superstitious about divine power, but is it right to be superstitious about unscientific old sayings? In short, science and superstition cannot coexist. What we should strive for in the future is that the road ahead is arduous and difficult to measure!</p>
<h3>Preventing Cholera!</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Recently, rumors of the discovery of true cholera have often spread in Beijing and Shanghai. This terrible rumor is tantamount to a death sentence for people who are nervous. Many people feel inexplicable anxiety, and many people shake their heads and sigh, lamenting that the world is no longer ancient, and that natural disasters and man-made disasters are coming down together.</p>
<p>Cholera is an acute infectious disease in summer. It spreads rapidly and widely. It can kill people in a few hours, and many people suffer from it. In 1854, the cholera mortality rate in London rose to 220 per 10,000 people. In 1892, the cholera in Hamburg, Germany, affected 640,000 people. From August 17th to October 23rd, more than 17,001 people were infected, and 8,605 people died from the epidemic. On the most serious day, 1,000 people contracted cholera. The situation of cholera epidemic in our country is also very terrible. It was rampant during the Yellow River flood in 1932, the epidemic in 1936, the widespread epidemic in 1939, the epidemic again in 1942, and the widespread epidemic in 1945, which spread throughout the country. There are no accurate statistics available for reference on its mortality and patients. Last year, the cholera epidemic affected 54,197 people, and 15,460 people died, with a mortality rate of 28.53%. From May 23rd to the end of August, 4,243 confirmed cholera patients were identified in Shanghai, with 3,348 deaths. If we include the unconfirmed suspected cases, the number reaches 11,837, and there are naturally many omissions. However, this huge number is enough to show the rampant spread and terrible invasion of cholera. These many innocent victims are still in people's memory.</p>
<p>Cholera is a special acute gastrointestinal infectious disease. The disease progresses very quickly, with vomiting and diarrhea as the main symptoms, as well as collapse, cramps, general weakness, cold hands and feet, thirst, and coma. Because patients often vomit and have diarrhea, they lose a lot of water. The eyes and fingers are often sunken. The vomit is like fruit juice, and the pathogen of this disease—Vibrio cholerae—can be detected.</p>
<p>There are many cholera bacteria in the patient's stool and vomit. If this bacterium is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract of another person, if this person's body has no resistance to Vibrio cholerae, cholera will occur in as little as a few hours and as long as three to five days. As for the route through which this bacterium invades the human body, there are probably the following ways:</p>
<p>1. Hands: Cholera is transmitted through hands because the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients will contaminate the patient's body, clothes, bedding, and other items. Therefore, touching the body of cholera patients or their clothes, bedding, utensils, or even using manure to water vegetables, or using hands to swat flies lying on the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients, can all cause hands to be contaminated with cholera bacteria. Before eating, if you have not washed your hands, this is a very easy opportunity for transmission.</p>
<p>2. Water: Cholera is transmitted through water because the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients are arbitrarily discharged without treatment and seep into the water. If you drink this contaminated water or eat food made with this sewage, you can contract cholera.</p>
<p>3. Flies: Cholera is transmitted by flies because flies like to burrow in dirty places. Therefore, it is very easy for them to stick cholera bacteria on their bodies because they have burrowed through the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients. When they fly to food, they will send these bacteria into our food, and we can get cholera by eating these foods.</p>
<p>Remember, cholera is transmitted orally. In addition to the patient themselves, the source of the pathogen can also come from "carriers." So-called carriers are people who are not sick themselves, but carry pathogens in their bodies. People who have just recovered from cholera still have cholera bacteria in their feces, and these are carriers. There are also people who are not sick themselves, but often excrete cholera bacteria in their feces. People who come into contact with patients may also be temporary carriers, and they can spread cholera bacteria to healthy people.</p>
<p>Now that we know how cholera is transmitted to people, we know how to prevent and control cholera. Cholera is a summer infectious disease transmitted orally. If we eradicate the source of the disease and cut off the transmission route, we can naturally prevent and control it. Now, let's try to explain it in two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Personal aspect</p>
<p>First, we should develop the habit of washing our hands before meals and not putting things into our mouths with our hands. Because our hands will come into contact with various things at any time, we don't know when we will accidentally touch things contaminated with the vomit of cholera patients. Therefore, washing hands frequently and not putting things into the mouth is a proper prevention method. In addition, pay attention not to get close to patients, and pay attention to disinfection after getting close.</p>
<p>Second, boil all drinking water, such as water used for drinking, washing, washing dishes, and food utensils. The water source should also be properly protected and disinfected when drinking to prevent cholera bacteria from surviving.</p>
<p>Third, prevent the breeding of flies, use gauze covers in kitchens and canteens, naturally and effectively improve environmental sanitation, and properly dispose of feces.</p>
<p>Fourth, do not eat raw or cold food, do not drink raw water, do not eat melons and fruits sold by street vendors, do not use raw water to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth, and do not overeat. These are all simple and easy-to-implement important methods.</p>
<p>Fifth, increase the human body's resistance to cholera by injecting cholera vaccine once a year. But please note that if there are symptoms of chills, fever, redness, and swelling after the injection, it doesn't matter and there is no harm. Vaccination does have immunity, which can last for three to six months, but this is not foolproof. If a large number of cholera bacteria enter the stomach, you will still get sick, but the illness will be much milder. Therefore, you must also be careful about your diet after getting a vaccination.</p>
<p>(2) Public aspect</p>
<p>First, if a suspected cholera patient is found, report it to the health authorities immediately to diagnose whether it is a true cholera patient. If it is a true cholera patient, the patient should be isolated immediately so that they do not come into contact with healthy people. The patient's feces and vomit should be thoroughly disinfected immediately. All items used by the patient or all of their belongings must be disinfected. The food left over by the patient should be burned. Second, people who have been in close contact with the patient should be quarantined for five days from the last possible day of contact. If there are cholera bacteria in the stool, the time should be extended. Contacts should also be immunized immediately.</p>
<p>Third, search for unreported cases and carriers, and investigate whether it may be transmitted by dirty drinking water or by contaminated but uncooked food in order to eradicate the source of infection.</p>
<p>Fourth, caregivers should strictly implement personal prevention, pay close attention to cleanliness, and disinfect their hands after each time they serve the patient or come into contact with vomit and contaminated objects. Avoid eating or drinking any food in the patient's room, or taking food out of the sickroom, and prohibit caregivers from entering the kitchen.</p>
<p>Fifth, in cholera-stricken areas, only cooked food is allowed to be eaten. After the food and drink are cooked or cooked, prevent flies and others from touching and contaminating them.</p>
<p>Cholera can indeed be prevented and eradicated. In European and American countries with advanced sanitation, the word "cholera" is already a noun in the dictionary and no longer as rampant and deadly as it is in our country. Before cholera is discovered, pay close attention to preventing its occurrence. This work is the common responsibility of the people and the health authorities. Efforts from either side alone will not succeed. I hope that citizens will pay close attention to summer hygiene and work hard on personal hygiene. I also hope that the health authorities will make a comprehensive, systematic, and complete plan and method as soon as possible to prevent cholera from attacking.</p>
<p>We recognize how cholera harms human beings, and we know how to defend ourselves. The lessons of past deaths are today's ability to defend ourselves. Let's not let cholera become a shameful and terrible epidemic in our country.</p>
<h3>Why Do We Get a Fever?</h3>
<p>— Ji Ting</p>
<p>If a feverish patient is discovered in a home, whether adult or child, the harmonious atmosphere immediately turns to gloom and depression. Fever is a common symptom of many diseases. Therefore, fever is both commonplace and important. Why do we get a fever? To understand this, we must first understand the normal state of the body.</p>
<p>The body's heat is generated by various metabolic processes. Excess heat is dissipated through the evaporation and conduction of the skin and lungs, maintaining the balance of body temperature. Muscle movement can generate a lot of heat, but the dilation of skin blood vessels, the excretion of sweat, and accelerated breathing all dissipate heat, reducing body heat. If body temperature tends to drop, or the climate is cold, skin blood vessels constrict and sweat production decreases, storing heat within the body to maintain a normal temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), but it varies slightly with time and location. For example, the temperature in the anus is one degree higher than in the mouth, and the temperature in the evening is higher than in the morning, due to work and rest.</p>
<p>The brain has a center dedicated to body temperature, which keeps the body temperature normal. If the body temperature center is stimulated, the body temperature will change. Animal experiments have shown that when the body temperature center (striatum or hypothalamus) is punctured with a needle, the body temperature immediately increases, resulting in fever. So, under normal circumstances, body temperature is very well regulated.</p>
<p>Fever is a complex phenomenon in the body. Not only does the regulatory function of the skin change, but digestion, respiration, and blood circulation are also affected. Before a fever, the blood vessels of the skin constrict, blood flow decreases, and heat dissipation is reduced, naturally increasing body temperature. Therefore, one often feels cold due to the constriction of skin blood vessels before a fever. Fever is a good sign, in other words, fever is beneficial to the body. Fever is a physiological defense mechanism of the body. The body, like an administrative organization, discovers that an enemy—a germ—has invaded. The ruling center immediately issues an order to capture and destroy it, attacking with all its might to eliminate the enemy. We know that blood contains many defensive substances. Besides some that are invisible, there are many cells with phagocytic action. If germs are discovered, they all pool their strength, fighting bravely until the germs are eliminated. During a fever, blood circulation increases, enhancing the power of transporting troops, making phagocytic cells more active, which can accelerate the elimination of germs. At the same time, some germs can grow at normal body temperature but cannot survive in high-temperature environments. The antibodies produced during a high fever are also more abundant than at normal temperature. Therefore, fever invisibly increases the body's resistance to germs, like increasing the military force for defense and security.</p>
<p>In hot and dry environments, many people who drink too little water cannot dissipate heat. Or, in hot and humid climates, where body heat cannot evaporate, body temperature can increase, causing a fever. This is called "heatstroke," which mostly occurs in the summer. This is caused by the body's temperature regulation mechanism being hindered. If heatstroke lasts too long or the fever is too high, it can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Many diseases can be diagnosed by observing the process of a fever. For example, malaria, with few exceptions, is known to start with cold, then heat, then sweating. This can help diagnose the disease by its fever pattern. Similarly, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and relapsing fever can all help doctors diagnose the illness by their fever patterns.</p>
<p>To know if someone has a fever, or the degree of the fever, the only way is to measure it with a thermometer. A thermometer is a necessary item in the home. Having a thermometer can save a lot of wasted money and anxiety, and reduce unnecessary worries. Housewives should also have some basic knowledge of fever to prevent adverse consequences and improve family health and happiness.</p>
<h3>Medical View of Fresh Milk</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu Peiqing</p>
<p>Milk is a liquid food, a collection of nutrients. It is fully equipped with fat, protein, carbonized hydrogen, mineral salts, moisture, and vitamins. From infancy to old age, it is suitable for all seasons. Some use it to replace meals for their entire lives. Some use it temporarily to fill their stomachs when sick in bed. And many infants hold it as their lifeline. Its nutritional importance need not be repeated. As we move into the height of summer, when the weather is hot, drinking fresh milk naturally has its values to be aware of.</p>
<p>(1) The Quality of Fresh Milk: Fresh milk with pure and excellent quality is the best choice, the so-called Grade A milk. Grade B milk is inferior in composition. Milk with the TT mark indicates that the cow has been tested with Tuberculin and proven free of tuberculosis. Milk delivered early should be drunk in the morning. Milk delivered in the afternoon should be delivered in the afternoon, so that the freshness is not reduced and the quality is not damaged.</p>
<p>(2) Preservation of Fresh Milk: Preserving fresh milk is quite difficult in summer. Fresh milk straight from the farm, cannot be preserved permanently without changing its quality. If there is air-conditioning equipment (electric refrigerator, cold storage, etc.), preservation is convenient. Milk delivered in the morning, except for drinking, the remaining milk can be sterilized by boiling. After sterilization, let the pot cool and put it in the refrigerator for afternoon use. It is not advisable to store it for more than a day and night. Unsterilized milk should not be refrigerated, otherwise it will easily spoil.</p>
<p>(3) Bacteria Contained in Fresh Milk: Fresh milk contains many microorganisms. The first milk squeezed out contains even more bacteria, which gradually decreases later. In addition, dust flying in the air, filth from the cowshed, unhygienic fingers of the milker, and unsterilized utensils contribute to the abundance of bacteria, which goes without saying. In foreign countries, formal licensed dairy farms produce milk that, before sterilization, must not exceed 10,000 bacteria per 1 c.c. Milk of lower quality contains about 50,000 bacteria per 1 c.c.</p>
<p>(4) The Response of Fresh Milk to Heat: When fresh milk is heated to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, a thin milk skin forms on the surface. This is because a portion of the casein is broken down, floats to the surface, and dries. At the bottom, there is a thick sediment that sticks to the sides, formed by the melting of calcium salts. If boiled for a long time, the pot emits a unique and fragrant milk odor, caused by the decomposition of sulfur compounds in milk protein. At the same time, it turns a caramelized color, and some of the milk fat floats to the top, resulting in a poorer taste and reduced nutritional value.</p>
<p>(5) Methods of Sterilizing Fresh Milk: Fresh milk must be re-sterilized before drinking. Milk from the farm, even if it has been sterilized by the Pasteurization method, is not always reliable. This is because the time between bottling and delivery to the consumer's home is always several hours, and the delivery en route is subject to bumps, dust, wind, rain, and snow, which inevitably cause contamination. It is difficult to drink with peace of mind without re-sterilization. According to the Pasteur method, milk is heated to 145 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes and then rapidly cooled. Its advantage is that the composition of the milk does not change, vitamin loss is minimal, and the milk is sterilized. All countries in the world adopt it, but it is difficult to implement without trained personnel. Within the home, the boiling method is more convenient. Pour the milk into a pot, heat it briefly, and when it boils, remove the lid to prevent it from overflowing. Take it out after about two minutes and drink it slightly cooled. A double-boiler method of heating milk is the safest and most convenient. However, it takes too long, which is its only drawback. Raw milk that has not been sterilized is particularly dangerous and should never be drunk.</p>
<p>(6) What Diseases Can Fresh Milk Transmit? Fresh milk has a high potential for transmitting diseases, with tuberculosis being the most frightening. Next are scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. Then there are foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax. Transmission can also be caused by unclean water. Diarrhea in children during the summer is often caused by poor milk. Therefore, health authorities in large cities strictly manage it to avoid the spread of disease.</p>
<p>(7) The Effect of Fresh Milk on Medicines: Fresh milk has a direct relationship with medicines, so patients who drink milk and take medicine should have a timed schedule. Medicines containing mercury, silver, or iodine, when taken with milk, can reduce the efficacy of the medicine. Taking them with various phage solutions can also reduce their effectiveness. Therefore, in cases of acute drug poisoning, doctors administer large amounts of fresh milk to neutralize the toxicity of corrosive drugs and lubricate the gastric and intestinal mucosa. As for taking alkaline medicines such as limewater and baking soda, they prevent the coagulation of milk, keeping it in a fluid state in the stomach. Acidic medicines, such as acetic acid, lactic acid, and dilute hydrochloric acid, cause fresh milk to coagulate rapidly into hard lumps that are difficult to digest. The stomach naturally secretes acid, so milk coagulates into lumps in the stomach. Fortunately, enzymes help the milk lumps gradually digest. The vomiting of milk lumps by infants is clear evidence of undigested, acid-coagulated milk.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Fresh milk is a nutritious mixture. Its effect is indeed better than dry milk powder and concentrated canned milk. In industrial chemistry, it is used as a natural raw material for manufacturing rayon, synthetic rubber, and artificial glass. In military chemistry, it is used as a raw material for manufacturing certain explosives. From a medical point of view, fresh milk has even wider uses. Because it is a liquid food, it is convenient to use. Whether for the sick or the healthy, for nourishment or leisure, it is universally applicable. It is also the only supplement to make up for the shortcomings of medicines.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fresh milk, because it contains rich fats and proteins, is also unsuitable for certain diseases, which may not be widely known. Here are some examples to clarify:</p>
<p>(1) Newborn infants, when breast milk is insufficient, and fresh milk is used as a substitute, after a considerable period, the infants become thin and have weakened resistance, lacking natural immunity, and are prone to diseases.</p>
<p>(2) Older infants, when breast milk is insufficient, using it for mixed feeding can easily cause indigestion, resulting in facial eczema (commonly known as milk rash) or other skin diseases.</p>
<p>(3) Acute nephritis, skin edema, reduce the input of protein to allow the urine to be excreted smoothly.</p>
<p>(4) Typhoid and paratyphoid fever, during the period of high fever, often have abdominal distension. To reduce the production of gas, avoid drinking milk.</p>
<p>(5) Dysentery and enteritis, frequent bowel movements, mixed with blood spots on the membrane, in order to reduce the breeding of bacteria, milk is also not suitable.</p>
<p>(6) Children with chronic indigestion, abdominal distension, rumbling sounds, to reduce the bloating of the intestines, fresh milk is also not suitable.</p>
<p>(7) Obese patients, weighing more than two hundred pounds, to avoid excessive diet and the absorption of large amounts of fat, fresh milk is also not suitable.</p>
<p>(8) Gout patients, uric acid excretion is not smooth, pain is abnormal, avoid drinking milk, in order to promote the discharge of uric acid.</p>
<p>(9) Patients with special neurological diseases and those with nervous hypersensitivity should avoid drinking it to avoid the peculiar smell of milk.</p>
<p>(10) Asthma patients, avoid drinking milk, sometimes to avoid the onset of paroxysmal asthma.</p>
<p>(11) During the convulsive period of pertussis children, drinking milk can easily cause the entire contents to be vomited, so semi-solid food is more suitable.</p>
<p>(12) Jaundice patients, bile duct blockage, should reduce the intake of milk, to avoid stimulating the secretion of bile.</p>
<p>(13) In the early stages of acute appendicitis, before surgery, the intake of milk should be completely stopped, in order to reduce the peristalsis of the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>(14) On the morning of administering general anesthesia, milk should be stopped, to avoid suffocation of the trachea when vomiting occurs during anesthesia.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples. But each disease has its stages, each doctor has their own opinions, not to mention nationality, region, old customs, personal habits, and personal quirks, which are all different. Some may also consider them not absolutely relevant, but my medical viewpoint should not be considered excessive criticism. I ask the readers, is it so?</p>

Please advise: If Mr. A's sentence has not expired, should he be returned to prison to continue serving his sentence? Also, does a life-term prisoner still have civil rights? A detailed answer is desired.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui Answers] If he escapes from prison before his sentence has expired, he should still be returned to prison to continue serving his sentence. Also, the period of deprivation of civil rights should depend on the court's judgment. However, those sentenced to life imprisonment should be declared deprived of civil rights for life.</p>

<h3>Seeking Girl Zhang Xiaomin</h3>
<p>Continued by Mr. Zhang, who is poor, sick, unemployed, and has a family of four, making it difficult to survive. Last July, his wife led her second daughter (named Zhang Xiaomin, six years old, with a Wujiang accent) to Shanghai to make a living, intending to work as a domestic helper. However, she could not find a place to settle with the girl, so she sent her to a certain charitable children's organization, but forgot its name and location. It is reported that the organization did not agree to take her in at the time. Fortunately, a certain staff member saw that the child was clever and her mother's situation was truly pitiful, so they adopted her. A year has passed before Mr. Zhang learned of this. He has come to Shanghai several times to search for her but has not found her. He is so heartbroken over his daughter that he has developed a nervous disorder. The separation of flesh and blood is extremely tragic! We are now seeking her on his behalf. It is hoped that the person who adopted the girl will notify this newspaper immediately so that Zhang Xiaomin can be reunited with her parents and her father can be rescued from his predicament. This would be a great good deed.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Warbling Bird</h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>We have moved to our current address for several years. In this alley, there is another family that moved here with us. This family is just like what Wordsworth said in a poem: "We are seven in number," father, mother, two sons, and three daughters. But before long, the eldest son and his father died one after another, and the seven became five. Now it has become four, because the middle daughter has married.</p>
<p>Except for this married daughter, the others are all just over four feet tall. But they have one appealing thing, that is, their home is filled with music all day long. When we first came, we heard the second daughter singing and practicing her voice. Her voice was very loud, and she was not afraid of people watching, listening, or laughing. She not only sang but also used musical instruments to accompany her. At first, it was a harmonium, and later it became a piano. The piano was borrowed from her lover, but she couldn't play it, she simply couldn't distinguish between the musical notes. Fortunately, she sang very well, with the style of a certain soprano. And she deliberately learned from her, becoming more and more like her. We thought she was probably a music teacher in a small school. But how could she be a teacher with that piano of hers? Among the three daughters, the eldest did not like to sing, and the youngest followed her second sister's example. Sometimes the second son would also hum along, but his voice was a bit unbearable. But his sisters did not object to his singing, and sometimes they would sing with him. It was truly a happy musical family.</p>
<p>But slowly, the second daughter's interest turned elsewhere. She began to fall in love. She saved her singing time to write love letters or talk to her lover. So the only one who continued to play and sing in this family was the youngest daughter. She was more persistent in singing than her sister. She not only sang for fun but also treated it as a serious matter. She not only wanted to learn from a certain soprano but also from many other singers. Unfortunately, her family was not very well off. Her older brother and sister were working outside, and she had to help her mother with household chores. But she never relaxed in her remaining time and devoted it all to singing. Although she was still young, her singing was inevitably childish, but she was fat and her voice was exceptionally round. Besides, she had another advantage, that is, she became more and more beautiful day by day. Of course, this beauty was only a childish beauty, but her future was by no means bleak, so she was very happy in her heart. Every day, after doing her duties with a happy heart, she began to play and sing. Sometimes, when she was tired of singing, she would go outside to plant flowers and prune the flower garden. But before long, she would suddenly remember something important, run into the room, and pick up her songbook. So the chaotic piano sounds and her clear singing would start again.</p>
<p>Year after year, her singing improved a lot, but her sister's singing became a thing of the past. Before long, her sister got married. After she got married, she took the piano with her, so the youngest daughter had to use clappers instead of the piano. Sometimes she would go to her sister's house. The purpose of her visit was not to see her sister, but to see the piano. She was now seventeen or eighteen years old, and she looked fresh, lively, and in the eyes of most people, she was invariably praised for her beauty. There was only one drawback, that is, she could not be as outstanding as her second sister and grow taller. Her height was probably less than four feet, and she was at the age of development, so she could not wear high heels, she could only grow horizontally, so she became fatter day by day. Fortunately, what most people paid attention to was often just a face. As long as the face was beautiful, they would not be too demanding of other things. So, whether in the eyes of others or in her own eyes, she belonged to the category of beauties.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this self-awareness of beauty that created a new situation for her. She can sing at home, why can't she sing outside? Those who are not as good-looking as her and sing worse than her still want to be singers, why can't she be one? In fact, she had long had this ambition in private. She had been painstakingly learning to sing for years, all for this. Now that the time was ripe, why didn't she start immediately? No, she has already started. Every day, she wears beautiful clothes, dresses up glamorously, and goes to engage in her new career. She goes out very late and comes back even later. Her family has gained a new batch of acquaintances, all of whom are fancy girls.</p>
<p>But she doesn't go out during the day. She still stays at home to sing during the day. And because she now has a slightly better income, she bought a radio. So, as long as she is at home, not a minute or a second goes by without popular songs being broadcast. When one station's program is over, she switches to another station. Sometimes she sings along with it, and the singing becomes even louder. Now the weather is getting sultry, and no one can avoid turning on the fan, so songs like "You're Obsessed," "Is It True or False," and "I Want You" are everywhere. If there is someone who is in the dancing business, they can't help but dance in their pockets.</p>
<p>One day, I was reading the newspaper and unintentionally saw an advertisement for a coffee shop, which read, "Special Guest Performance by Miss Gu Jing." I knew that Gu Si was not her, because I had seen Gu Jia. But I couldn't help but think in my heart, if I gave her the name Gu Jia, how appropriate it would be! "A Warbling Bird from the Valley" is a perfect portrayal of her!</p>
<h3>The Names of Grasses, Trees, Birds, and Beasts</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Wang Yun wrote in a poem: "Frost covers the creeping fig on the locust tree, wind startles the grass guarding the door." It is said that Changshan has a herb called "Hundred Spirits Grass." If placed under the door, when something harmful passes by, the grass will scold it, hence the name. "Creeping fig on the locust tree" is mentioned in the Erya, its leaves curling up during the day. Gu Yaofan wrote in a poem: "Startling the talking myna bird, monkeys cry along with the 'indeed' bird." Yuan Weizhi wrote in a poem: "'Indeed' bird's skin is better than silk, myna bird's tongue is like a human's." "Myna bird" resembles the starling, entirely black, with yellow fleshy crests behind the eyes, yellow feet, and a red beak, capable of imitating human speech. "Indeed bird," according to Tianzhong Ji, resembles a macaque and calls out its own name. Lu Guimeng wrote in a poem: "Resting often in the shade of the 'crow uncle', often seeing the 'mouse aunt's' heart when picking." "'Crow uncle'" is a kind of bird, also known as "slap cheek," or "mountain call." "'Mouse aunt'" is another name for the peony, mentioned in the herbal classics. Nowadays, those who casually recognize the names of plants, birds, and beasts may not be able to explain these.</p>
<h3>Cuckoo</h3>
<p>— Ren Weiyin</p>
<p>The cuckoo is cruel,</p>
<p>It is the ornament of twilight.</p>
<p>But fair God, the cuckoo is innocent!</p>
<p>Because without it, this sorrow still exists.</p>
<p>The mountains and forests are dense and desolate, the fiery red of the pomegranate flowers has faded, this is the time when the cuckoo cries blood, as the poet says; this is the sorrow filtered out by the web of life. I do not know what this little black-feathered creature thinks of the universe, but I am infected by this desolate chill, this bottomless melancholy.</p>
<p>I have always been afraid of the word "homecoming," homecoming is the end of everything; including the beautiful desolation of a wanderer at dusk in the cold. I love the character of the Gypsies, I love that musical people, when the cooking fire is lit in the wilderness, when the door of tomorrow has not yet opened, isn't the mystery of the future the most touching? Cuckoo! Tonight, in my sleepless hearing, I hear your call again, are you sighing for tomorrow, or are you longing for the past, when the ancient warriors under the yellow sand are all sleeping soundly, can you not help but indulge in unrestrained reveries towards the vast sky, do you love the spirit of Emperor Wang (Note 1), or do you still miss the ancient beauties and lands?</p>
<p>Ah, cuckoo! Only the wise have sorrow and indignation, only those who die for love have eternal sleep, perhaps you understand the taste of retiring after success, but you are willing to throw yourself into the torrent, transforming into wide-spreading wings soaring through the world (Note 2), but life is just a cup of bitter wine, you can only drink it once, and after this drink, will it bring your complaints morning and evening? No, cuckoo, I know that this complaint is the end of the season, a sign of people's distress, but it is the beginning of everything for you.</p>
<p>Tonight, I wander alone under the silent eaves, your cries come from further and further away. At this moment, there is not a single ray of light in the long sky, the white radiance of the stars and moon are all flickering outside the thick dark clouds; I cannot shorten the distant distance of space, lift your skin to the sky; however, the stars and moon shining in the sky seem to be bright in my heart. Although the darkness is all around me, the dense rows of mountains and forests are already containing the night dew rising.</p>
<p>Where is the edge of the desolate wilderness? Where does the writing of dusty history begin? Where are the famous officials, beauties? Where are the giants, sons, famous kings, and famous generals? Cuckoo! Underneath is piled up the stale continuation of history, in that stale wax, there are bones and white bones; skulls and white bones forever have your sigh, a cup of bitter wine can only be drunk once, and after this drink, what can be done to redeem you?</p>
<p>Ah! The source of the overflowing water, the highest peak of the mountain, whether it is high in the sky or deep in the sea, is turning in a circle. The Creator did not ignite the fire deep in the earth, expelling the severe cold in the sky; but through ancient times to uninhabited centuries, icebergs have frozen the fierce water, and the fierce fire has also scorched the ocean. Not a single poet, not a single hero has ever thought of this. Cuckoo! Do you feel that human beings are too small? Therefore, I understand your complaints, your powerful sigh;</p>
<p>But this sigh is just un-notated music, like a laborer's dream, waking up leaving only vague impressions. I don't know how much difference there is between talent and foolishness, the distance of this question, then destined your weaving fate. You are a poet of grief, you sing of the old age of the season, you ignite feelings for the insignificant human beings.</p>
<p>In the night of Bashan, the thick and fragrant flowers have already dissipated. The always hungry green velvet is now silent in the middle of the night; what does the poet of destiny want to do? From across the window sill comes your lonely lament.</p>
<p>Note 1: "Huayang Guozhi": Shu chancellor Kaiming admired the beauty of Emperor Du Yu's empress, and even assassinated Emperor Wang to seize his queen. Emperor Wang's resentment did not dissipate, and he entered Qingcheng Mountain and transformed into a strange bird, which is Du Juan, also known as Du Yu. Li Yishan's line "Emperor Wang's spring heart entrusted to Du Juan" refers to this.</p>
<p>Note 2: Li Bing controlled the waters, dredged the Minjiang and Tuojiang rivers, and completed the water conservancy of Sichuan Province. As soon as the work was completed, Li Bing threw himself into the water and transformed into a cuckoo. See "Qingcheng Mountain Records," and also the Sichuan people's legend that Lady Huarui transformed into a cuckoo.</p>
<h3>Small Gathering Listening to Cicadas</h3>
<p>— Lao Kai</p>
<p>Cicada</p>
<p>The cicada represents the coming of bright summer, shedding its ancient yellowish-brown shell, and is such a powerful symbol of health!</p>
<p>It squats on high green branches, overlooking the bustling world, looking askance at everything. In order not to sink and float with the world, it would rather feed on the wind and dew, living a simple life.</p>
<p>At dawn, when the morning breeze and the waning moon remain, it is the first to awaken. When dusk quietly falls from the peaks, it leisurely sings its song.</p>
<p>Its song is so noisy that those who compete for fame and profit cannot help but feel disturbed and agitated when they hear it.</p>
<p>However, this noble hermit always opens his stubborn eyes, and does not easily stop his singing because of other people's disgust.</p>
<p>It sings, even when the sun is shining white in the scorching noon, it does not feel the threat of heat or a trace of weariness.</p>
<p>Bad children walk towards it with bamboo poles. "Born of dust, die of dust." is its ready-made eulogy.</p>
<p>Shooting Star</p>
<p>On summer nights, one can often see shooting stars passing through my window, passing through the plains of Guanghan.</p>
<p>Shooting stars are like sparks of hope that flash and disappear; they are also like the lengthened tear lines of a passionate girl in longing.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often wanted to get some explanation from it, but I couldn't. I once thought of it as a flying firefly with a tail.</p>
<p>I love it for finally having a moment of brilliance in the deathly dark night; finally burning the flame of life.</p>
<p>Summer Clouds</p>
<p>Clouds are beautiful, and summer clouds are especially beautiful.</p>
<p>Some say: Clouds are illusions woven from color; clouds are rich poems.</p>
<p>Stretching outside my window: there is a high and strange sky, and there are all kinds of floating clouds, these clouds are sometimes peach-colored, gray-colored, and sometimes milky white, lead-colored. Its traces are also quite difficult to grasp: here, it sometimes hangs upside down at the edge of the forest, like a wine flag, sometimes lying horizontally on the mountainside, like a huge white python; sometimes it wanders in the azure sea of the sky, making people think of ancient, clear sails.</p>
<p>In vulgar busyness, or in lonely leisure, taking the time to look at the clouds, perhaps it is not entirely meaningless, right?</p>
<h3>Portrait (Oil Painting)</h3>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 348</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The oracle is a very auspicious one, a series of killings. It only advocates sweeping away demons, not revenge. Because of the guidance of this oracle, Dingyuan also returned to his original advocacy; instead of seeking private revenge, it is better to keep a useful body to avenge the country. He felt that although the old Taoist had limited knowledge, he was a sincere person, so he planned with the old Taoist on how to kill the demons. The old Taoist originally advised Dingyuan to "disguise himself as a Taoist priest, which can prevent the demons from suspecting him," but unfortunately, Dingyuan did not have long hair and could not pretend to be a Taoist priest; he simply shaved his head and became a temporary Buddhist disciple. The old Taoist said, "Very good, Buddhism and Taoism are one family. In the past, the Three Purities often visited Tathagata Buddha, and the Bodhisattvas Cundi, Amitabha, and Guanyin all came from Taoism..." Before Dingyuan left, the old Taoist returned the pistol he had found on Dingyuan, and promised to burn incense for him every day, asking the Three Purities and the Demon-Subduing Erlang God to silently bless him and sweep away the demons.</p>
<p>Dingyuan's disguise was very much to the liking of the Japanese devils. After several contacts, the Japanese army actually invited Dingyuan to chant scriptures for the Japanese soldiers who died in battle, because their "military monks" had not accompanied the army on this expedition. The Japanese secret service also gradually contacted Dingyuan, using him to inquire about some trivial news...</p>
<p>"This is my little experience," Dingyuan told me; "It's going quite well... I'm very good at fabricating intelligence, but I'm just suffering from the fact that I can't transmit the devils' movements to our own army... I have also tried my best to act within the range restricted by the devils..."</p>
<p>"It wasn't until the night before yesterday that I suddenly learned that the Japanese secret agents had captured several 'anti-Japanese elements' here in Changping, that I decided to get involved with them. They told me to pay attention to other comrades active outside, there are dozens of them in total, especially to pay attention to their leader, a big girl in her twenties, who might pass through Changping..."</p>
<p>"That night, I accidentally ran into Miss Ji Yaoqun, who was dressed as a man. Originally, I didn't recognize her, but she saw through my disguise and called out my name in one breath..." As soon as I heard that Yaoqun was really here, I interrupted Dingyuan and asked him if he could bring Yaoqun here, or if we could go find her.</p>
<p>"Not today," Dingyuan sighed, "If it could be done, Captain Sun (〇4) would have invited Miss Ji over just now..."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I heard Dingyuan sigh and was afraid that Yaoqun had also been captured by the Japanese secret agents.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Dingyuan rushed to reassure me: "It's just that she's too brave: she went to Zhiyi Bridge last night..."</p>
<p>"What for?" I couldn't help but exclaim with concern.</p>
<p>"To arrange an action, probably related to the several comrades who were arrested here, to rescue them from danger."</p>
<p>"Why go to Zhiyi Bridge?... Where is this bridge?" I seemed to have lost my mind, pressing Dingyuan to ask.</p>
<p>"Zhiyi Bridge is seven or eight li south of here, not far from Xiyan Town in Shahe County, it is the headquarters of the Japanese secret service..."</p>
<p>"Why would she run to the demon's den alone?" I asked myself; and asked the other question? "Is she alone, or does she have helpers -- that troublemaker from Yihu City?..."</p>
<p>"I'm not too clear about that," Dingyuan seemed to be recalling something. ... Sighing, as if</p>
<h3>Talking About Rent Again</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear that the municipal government has formally convened various parties to discuss the issue of rents in this city, because this concerns the livelihood of all people in Shanghai, we cannot help but hope that the municipal government can use a "quick knife to cut through the mess" this time, and completely solve the case that has been unresolved since the victory.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a dense population, much higher than before the war, that is a fact; government agencies are concentrated in the downtown area, and office workers have to live in the city center, that is also a fact; the number of military units in the suburbs of Shanghai has increased, and they demand housing, that is also a fact; the number of military vehicles in Shanghai has increased sharply, with the total number of various military vehicles reaching 210,000, causing civilian housing to also reach saturation, this is also a fact; due to these factors (plus price fluctuations, and the soaring black market prices of gold and US dollars), they can all create the abnormal state of rents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are many empty rooms in Shanghai, and skyscrapers are everywhere, what they want are gold bars, US dollars, and legal tender, some people calculate interest rates, and are not willing to let the house; people without gold bars and US dollars have no way to rent a house. This causes; there are houses without people living in them, and people without houses do not know where to squeeze in?</p>
<p>We ask the municipal government to open up these empty high-rise buildings, open up those empty rooms closed off with gold bars and US dollars! Establish fair and impartial leasing regulations, so that Shanghai can return to the pre-war rental state!</p>
<p>Just like the municipal government's several battles with the black market for gold and US dollars, the rent issue will also require sending out a large number of inspectors, using lightning-fast tactics, and forcing those empty houses to open up, if necessary, encouraging citizens to report in secret, conducting a comprehensive investigation of all the surplus houses in Shanghai, so that they can be legally rented out.</p>

<h3>Returning from Iron Anchors: Remembering the Sino-Japanese Naval War of 1894</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>Following the anchor chains and shells brought back to the motherland by the Flying Star Wheel, two iron anchors also returned with the Long Shun Wheel. When we saw the foot-long iron anchors, we could still imagine the heroic posture of the Zhenyuan battleship, the mother body of the anchor. For fifty years, the anchors and shells were displayed as trophies in Hibiya Park in Japan. After several negotiations after the victory, they finally returned to the motherland. How can we not be filled with emotion when we see this?</p>
<p>Recalling before 1894, the total tonnage of the national navy reached as much as 145,900 tons. If inland river vessels are removed, there are still 85,000 tons, which is more than four-tenths greater than Japan's total of 59,000 tons. In the 17th year of the Guangxu reign, Ding Ruchang once led six battleships and cruisers on an eastward tour of Japan. Two years later, Li Hongzhang held a grand naval review in the Xianhaiwei, and the strength of the fleet shocked and frightened Japan, causing them to prepare for war. However, not long after, in the war of 1894, China was defeated, its weaknesses were fully exposed, and the navy was completely annihilated. What was the reason for this?</p>
<p>People in the past have lamented the uselessness of our navy, but in reality, they have not thoroughly understood the environment, situation, and combat process at that time. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894 had the main battle of the Yellow Sea and two defense battles in Lushun and Weihaiwei. Soviet historians once commented on the Weihaiwei military battle: "The Chinese army showed indeed heroism." After the Battle of Fengdao, the sea power of the Korean Peninsula was lost. The Battle of the Yellow Sea was comparable to the Battle of Jutland between Britain and Germany during the European War. Later, in the Lushun and Weihaiwei defense battles, the army abandoned the fortress, which forced the tragic fate of the fleet. In terms of the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the enemy had 12 ships totaling 39,487 tons. Our Admiral Ding commanded the Beiyang Fleet with nine battleships and one Guangjia ship, totaling 31,345 tons, so the strength was already inferior. The Zhenyuan ship was protecting Ding Ruchang's flagship, the Dingyuan ship. The 12-inch shells were exhausted, the deck was severely damaged, the third officer died, and the first officer commanded the battle with his whole body covered in blood. The officers and soldiers suffered many casualties. The ship fought bravely in the Weihaiwei battle and was captured, but the new captain Yang Yonglin committed suicide with a pistol in his mouth, and his death was particularly tragic. Therefore, the return of the iron anchors is due to the war history of the past, and it is not ashamed of the motherland. Because our warships had low speed, the cannons were old and few, and the armor was weak, the comparison in quality was large, but they were still able to fight and resist the enemy. However, the cause of the defeat was not only this.</p>
<p>We examine the history of the Sino-Japanese Naval War and gain a few lessons: First, the government was corrupt, arrogant, and did not pay attention to naval preparations. For example, Li Hongzhang strongly requested the court to purchase warships and rapid-firing guns, but he was blocked by his political enemies and those who opposed war, such as Weng Tonghe, who said, "How can Japan dare to offend our superior country? The preparations made by the Beiyang Fleet are enough to break Japan's courage, and it is expected that they will not cross the sea and come from afar." The officials in the court were contemptuous of the enemy and arrogant, did not understand the situation, and neglected naval defense, especially since the 20 million taels of silver used for military ships were moved to repair the Summer Palace, and there was no hope of adding ships and purchasing cannons. How could one speak of fighting with a majority of simple ships against the newly built Japanese ships that were unanimously built by the court and the public? Second, military discipline was lax. At that time, the generals ate dirty things and embezzled military pay. Some of the cannons were unbearable to fire. The people who purchased the cannons only sought to reduce the price by 30% to 20%, without asking if they were usable. The Weihaiwei fort's garrison commander suppressed the pay for three months, and moved them to his home during the war. The supplies that should have been issued to the various ships were also contracted and embezzled; and the staff of the armory actually acted as spies, selling the list of Chinese naval heavy artillery and the number of soldiers and information on troop transports. Third, military administration and military orders were not unified, and the army and navy did not coordinate in combat. Li Hongzhang commanded the Beiyang Navy, Zeng Guoquan commanded the Nanyang Navy, and the Minyue Navy and others also managed themselves, and did not interfere with each other. The Naval Yamen had no power to command, and Admiral Ding Ruchang could not command the national fleet (he himself was a land general). Without a commander, how could one not be defeated? And the army and navy also had no coordinated plans for overall combat. Fighting without an overall strategy and unified command, the signs of defeat were already obvious. For example, the cannons were actually under the control of the army, the forts were neglected, the port defenses were empty, and the navy's liaison was ineffective, and they were forced into an inferior position everywhere. Although Li Hongzhang was a sincere person, he was unable to plan effectively overall before and during the war. Without repairing military equipment and unifying military orders, it is difficult to control the chances of victory.</p>
<p>Looking back on the lessons of the past, at this time of building the army, it is precisely the time to focus on reforms. But our coastal defense , coastal defense is still not firmly established by words, we must work hard. What's more, Japan is now attempting to make a comeback. Recently, the general allowed the Japanese to establish a whaling fleet and go to the Antarctic to hunt whales and fish in the central sea, which is a premonition of the Japanese future conspiracy to establish a medical team, and should be guarded against. Our country should take the same position as Australia and resolutely oppose it.</p>
<h3>Robert Taylor and Lana Turner in "Johnny Eager"</h3>
<h3>One of Germany's Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Gu Bin</p>
<p>The British scientists, in assisting their navy to gain an advantage in the war against German submarines, certainly played an important role and constantly forced the enemy to frequently change its tactics.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources, in the early spring of 1944, German Admiral Doenitz once gave a speech containing "pep talks" to German naval officers in Weimar, in which he made an interesting comment on British science, especially mentioning "Radiolocation." He said: "At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, one development on the enemy's side (referring to the British side) has obviously made us feel worried, and will always make us feel worried, that is, the enemy's use of radiolocation to deprive our submarines of a very important characteristic - its element of surprise. Now they have used this principle to gradually overcome the threat given to them by our submarines."</p>
<p>Doenitz went on to say that the scientists who invented radiolocation had been revered as saviors of their country. It can be seen that what led to success in submarines was not any superior strategy or tactics, but really due to the superiority of scientific research.</p>
<p>"Germany withdrew her very valuable scientists, ordered them to serve in the armed forces, and did not allow them to continue to engage in scientific research, until after a long period of eight months, the highest authorities finally ordered them to be exempted from service and ordered them to return to the laboratory to work again. We should admit that we have made a big mistake."</p>
<p>However, the British authorities did not make such a major mistake. On the contrary, since the outbreak of the war, they immediately directed their scientists, both inside and outside the armed forces, to quickly engage in scientific research. Specifically, the Admiralty hired more than 3,000 scientists, buried in their various laboratories and offices, so they were slightly better than the scientists in any other country. And they were also recruited into the newly formed "British Royal Naval Scientific Research Institute," and given very generous monthly salaries.</p>
<p>From this point, we can know that the British Navy was the first in the world to recognize the importance of maintaining scientific research work, regardless of wartime or peacetime, so it first established such a special research institute that recruited various talents, such as those familiar with magnetic mines and invented hymophones.</p>
<h3>Summer Night Record by the Screen</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>A Small Lamb Can Be Made Large</p>
<p>Weilu Suoji contains a story about "A Sheep Coming Out of a Sleeve":</p>
<p>"In Zhili Province, whenever it is time to sacrifice to the sages on the Shangding day, the butcher prepares sheep and pigs, but the school official will repeatedly criticize them for being thin and scrawny. Even after ten exchanges, none are suitable for use. Only when the butcher bribes the Guangwen can he agree. There was a fortunate butcher who, on the eve of the provincial sacrifice, the sheep still did not arrive. The officers urgently pressed him, and the butcher slowly entered, wearing wide clothes and sleeves, with something heavy in his sleeves. The officer said: You supply the sheep several times, has the sheep arrived? It's late. The butcher took out a small lamb from his sleeve. The officer said: A lamb is not enough for the sacrifice. The butcher said: There is something else, and then took out more than ten thousand banknotes, and said: The lamb is small and thin, this is to help the lamb get fat and make it large. The officer laughed. The butcher left with an arrogant look."</p>
<p>Here, the face of the school official is thoroughly sketched out. The officer's "laughter" and the butcher's "arrogance" are both wonderfully portrayed, worthy of a "Record of the Appearance of the Official Arena." "The yamen opens its eight characters, don't come in without money." With money, a small lamb can be turned into "large", decay can be turned into magic, and a bribe is more than just "can communicate with the gods."</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Guo</p>
<p>American Secret Service Agents</p>
<p>Where there is government, there are secret agents. Secret agents are the ears and eyes of the government, the nerves of the government. The Qing Yongzheng Emperor had a very thorough secret service organization, but their scope of activity was limited to the palace, and they could not be fully utilized. The secret agents of Germany, Russia, and Japan are all famous in the world, but the quality of the Americans is the highest. Washington has a secret agent training school, which is the main camp for the United States to manufacture secret agents. The qualifications for admission must be graduation from a university with a degree in law, economics, or political science, having worked as a lawyer or accountant for three years, and must have a proper appearance, elegant demeanor, and be well-spoken, without any white-collar air. After being trained rigorously for several years after entering the school, they must be able to speak and write multiple foreign languages and be able to use all kinds of small weapons, such as various pistols, machine guns, and air guns, before being assigned work. These agents are mostly neatly dressed in suits and ties, carrying briefcases in one hand, or wearing gold-rimmed glasses, appearing like university professors, and no one suspects that they are secret agents. American secret agents often enter society with identities as lawyers or foreign businessmen, bankers, educators, military officers, business tycoons, and artists, and thus can infiltrate various industries without being suspected by outsiders. Their murder weapons are hidden very carefully, most of them hidden in their overcoats or raincoats. Their marksmanship is extremely precise, and they never hit vital points when capturing criminals alive. The head of the secret service, Hoover, is the nephew of former President Hoover, and he is indomitable. Whenever capturing major criminals, Hoover personally takes the lead. When he captured Public Enemy Number One, Capone, alive, he only led three armored vehicles, blocked the main road, and used loudspeakers to persuade him to surrender. Public Enemy Number One, seeing that there was no way to escape, surrendered. Hoover shook hands with him and rode in the same military vehicle. When President Roosevelt went to Africa to attend the Three Giants Summit, the American secret agents made arrangements in Cairo a month in advance. Heavy artillery was placed in any tall building. The Japanese secret agents detected that the Three Giants were meeting in Cairo, but in fact they were meeting in Tehran. This was an American secret agent trick. The British Ambassador to Jiang learned from South America that someone should secretly meet with President Roosevelt. The Jiang's secret service sent a group of troops directly from Cairo, disguised as sailors to Nanzhen, and the British sent an envoy to present Roosevelt with a list of German secret agents in the United States, and then they captured all the German spies. Hoover has now published a portion of these stories in books. (22)</p>
