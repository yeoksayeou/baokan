<h3>中共欲再廢墟上　組織共產黨政權</h3>
<p>曼哲斯特晩報評論</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十二日電〕曼哲斯特晚報今評論中國之戰事稱，自馬歇爾於五月前離華以來，無疑的蘇聯始終在協助中共，一如其過去協助中共在東北立足者然。中共威脅，在過去六個月中已大為增加，僉信中共在東北已佔領廣大之土地，同時中共藉大連及旅順（蘇聯不顧中蘇條約刻仍佔領該兩港口）源源以援兵運往華北。該報稱，中共最近已在倫郭設立新華社，發行大宗週刊宣傳品，此點甚為重要。國民黨之過失，已被廣為宣傳，然在國外宣傳中共為農民唯一友人之人士，若非故意，則必為有意欺騙自己。蓋吾人已確證凡為共黨所滲之每村落，其農民無不席捲其所有而恐怖出逃者。共黨之目的，在造成混亂，俾推翻政府，從而在廢墟中建立共黨政府。</p>

<h3>魏德邁週內啟程　美報重視魏氏奉派來華　白宮及國務院保持緘默</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕白宮及國務院方面，對魏德邁將軍出使之眞正意義，仍持緘默態度，而靜候魏氏對當地情况作全盤考察之結果。聞魏氏將於下週內啓程，而於八月下半月返美。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕立法院副院長吳鐵城，今日向聯合社記者談稱：『魏德邁將軍以總統特使資格，前來中國與朝鮮擔任視察。此乃極可歡迎之消息。魏氏以前在重慶與吾人合作，渠當時知悉吾人之問題，並省察吾人之困難。吾人對其才幹及遠見卓識，極為欽佩。此次親自前來視察與分析吾人當前之問題，吾人甚為欣慰。吾人深信魏氏之視察工作，結果將澄淸有關吾政府之誤解。視察結果對於美國形成其對亞洲問題之長期政策，必有適當貢獻』云。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據本市中韓文化協會主任秘書李若泉語記者，該會正準備充分資料，以備魏將軍來華赴韓時參考，更將召集文化人士及東方問題專家，舉行座談會，俾集合寳貴意見，貢獻予魏將軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕魏德邁將軍受命赴華之意義，不僅在人選方面之抉擇（按魏氏被認為美國第一流軍事策劃家之一）·且在其任命所際之時會。前此各方認為美國對華政策，須在駐華大使館公使銜參贊白德華返國後，再就基本問題，重新考慮。杜魯門不待白氏歸國遠而任命魏德邁，或可表示遠東局勢之緊急。觀乎美蘇問之緊張鬥爭，中韓兩國之情勢，實不能再與歐洲問題隔離。墓督敎科學　首報專訪國務院消息記者史坦福，昨報導「美對華政策正進行重大檢討」時，曾作下述意義深長之議論。史氏曰：「華盛頓消息靈通人士，均一致相信。數月來歐洲所發生之事件，不能與亞洲之發展相隔躍。華府權威人士，認為蘇聯之外交政策，與非蘇聯之世界接觸時，均含有擴張主義之壓力，倘情形如此，則美國係發制機先，派遣美國首流戰略家之一魏德邁將軍赴中韓實地考察危急之局勢，以禦蘇聯之試騐者乎！白宮聲明魏氏將「就該局勢作一估價，」則魏氏之使命是否將超越對兩國經濟上之援助。關於魏氏之任命，紐約報紙迄今尙無評論。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十三日電〕塔斯社十二日華盛頓電，評論魏德邁受命赴華稱：杜魯門政府計劃予中國以新援助。</p>
<h3>美國對華政策　將予澈底檢討</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統派遣前中國戰區美軍司令魏德邁至中國及朝鮮調查實際情形之舉，可以確定美國對華政策，將予以澈底檢討。魏氏調査結果，可助當局決定美國是否甘冒蘇聯對抗之危險，援助蔣主席剿共，並援助至何程度。魏氏重新檢討美國對華政策中，借款及軍火接濟之　礎，均將涉及。據中國駐美大使顧維鈞之意，中國需要「政治性質之借款」二千億美元，作為建設之用。進出口銀行之小額借款，則另案辦理。惟此間外交官員仍以為美國政府如決定援助，蔣主席須切實肅淸頑固派，多容納民主份子。</p>
<h3>有效援助中國使成亞洲台柱</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十三日電〕據熟悉遠東事件之可靠方面十三日暗示稱，赴遠東之魏德邁代表團，將帮助美國官員決定在東方是否有一經濟及政治安定之可能的「中心」存在。其地位之重要，一如魯爾之在馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃中然。此間官方有力意見之一，力持在國民黨統治下之中國，應在工業上加以支援。如此，則不但能保存中國不受共黨支配，並且可藉此使中國成為全亞洲之台柱。另一派相信，中國此項發展實無把握，充其量亦非常遲緩與困難。</p>
<p>在後一派意見中，若干人認為，日本更適宜於作亞洲可能的經濟中心。另有人主張必須以逐步調整的辦法，提高菲列賓，朝鮮，中國，日本及印度尼西亞之經濟實力。</p>
<p>在歐洲，魯爾之所以成為復興計劃之中心，因該地為煤產及工業來源地。舉例言之，魯爾煤斤生產，如顯著之生產擴大可能，將能使　　工廠增多鋼鐵生產，　爾煤斤增加，並能增加化學肥料工暢之生產。如此，更可增加食料生產，而使工人生產能力亦能擴大。此一切，預料可使許多國家之人民更表示滿意，而　致更大之政治安定，减少共產主義之威脅。</p>
<p>巴黎會議對於魯爾將予以密以注意。雖則在美國政界對於亞洲是否能進行一種類　歐洲模樣之復興工作，深致懷疑，然一致相信，魏德邁代表團將有助於一項見諸行動政策之制定，以便美國在某一地帶之進步，能貢獻其力量。某一官員稱，魏氏代表團之所能作為者，至少能對中韓兩國列入美國世界廣汎援助估計之內，此事美國或在下數年內將責無旁貸者也。渠稱：根據此一立塲，對中國情勢予以估計，尤為重要，因美國納稅人，對於歐亞及中東復興計劃所引起之負担，深感重累。因此認為渠等應小心加以調整，意欲使費用减至最少限度。現正努力促使世界每一部份，盡量做到由自身負担一切費用。此即馬揪爾訐劃之　本思想。</p>
<h3>改組地方政府　原則業經決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕民社黨府委胡海鬥，十三日晨對記者稱：張君勱前次來京謁主席時，除對動異令有所商討外，並就地方政府之改組問題有所決定。近日政務會議中討論之刷新地方政治，即將改組一部份地方政府，對該項問題，民·青兩黨與政府之意見已趨一致。民·靑兩黨均將參加地方政府之改組。又此次各地地方政府之改組，均係對調性質，因本年度選舉時，現任官吏不得在當地當選，故經過此項對請後，地方官吏即可順利當選。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕民社黨反對派汪世銘，昨日由滬抵平活動，據稱：革新會全國代表會，展至七月十五日在滬舉行，渠週後將與張重蓀同行赴滬。張一汪十三日曾在梁秋水宅晤談，張東蓀稱：彼是否加入革新會，到滬後再行決定。</p>
<h3>立法院代表團　分訪美國朝野　交換中美間法律意見</h3>

<h3>瀋陽西安發現飛碟</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十三日電〕成為世界之謎的飛碟，已發現於瀋陽上空。首先發現者為鞍山　　公司駐瀋辦事處職員燕金波君，燕君稱彼於十日晚十時三十分，在其宿舍前　塲納凉時，忽瞥見一白而團之物體，倐然滑過高空，由東北飛向西南，為時僅數秒鐘。此後每相隔不一分鐘，即有一個飛來，皆飛往同一方向，似極有規律。彼初以為係隣舍炊烟，嗣乃發覺，此物如為氣體，不能如是之團圓光潔。燕君稱：「是時，其家人皆已入睡，乃招其同事張縈韶同觀，該物連續飛行達一小時。至十一時半始行絕跡。」另據張君統計，彼等在一小時內，共看見約八十餘個。張君稱，該物極圓，由地面望之，直徑約四尺許，色乳白而略含淺藍，狀若玉盤，但彼相信其並非具有有實質之物體，亦決非探照燈所為，蓋探照燈必有地上放射之光綫，此則無之。張君稱，彼當時即念及此或即美國所發現之飛碟，但彼無從獲致有力證明。</p>

<h3>對旅大問題飾詞强辯　蘇無履行條約誠意　我堅決要求軍警進入兩地</h3>
<p>東北接收某要員談</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕據塔斯社於十一日發表蘇聯公報，對我旅大聲明，多所抵辯。中央社記者頃向我東北接收機關某軍要人員，詢問意見。還稱：「蘇聯政府公報，明眼人一看便知其為飾詞，不煩吾人多辯。我政府所堅決要求者，為中國軍隊警察得進入大連旅順，以保護中國接收行政人員之安全與自由。此為中蘇條約所明白許可之事，至少亦為中蘇條約所不曾禁止之事，倘中國接收機關，不能獲得政府軍警之充分保護，其結果如何，可自去歲蘇軍佔領長春時情形推定之。當時該地負責者為蘇軍，當局與今日之旅順同，當時蘇聯政府亦曾應允予我一切協助，但我接收機關因無政府軍警且無派軍警入長春之自由，一時幾成中共之俘虜。當時巿內巿外之中共威脅與騷擾，甚至使我行營之對外交通亦被截斷。我旅大接收機關，如無充分政府軍警為之保護，證諸以往經騐，勢須準備為反抗政府者之俘虜或他人之傀儡。我外交當局堅持我方軍警必須能自由入駐大連，蓋不欲我旅大接收人員，為任何方面之俘虜或傀儡。其立塲與態度，極為正當。蘇聯政府應迅速改正其態度，否則任何人均將認其無履行條約之誠意」。</p>
<p>按：十一日蘇聯各報所載塔斯社聲明大略如次：「蘇軍當局早在一九四五年十二月及一九四六年一月，即通知中國代表，蘇聯擬對國中在大連成立政府事，給與一切協助，然中國雖任命該地官員，迄無一人前往大連就職。因蘇方於一九四六年十二月，再度要求中國政府重新任命呂連旅順官員，其後在一九四七年三月七日，又提要求，惟未獲答復。致使不明眞象者，發生錯誤結論。又中國公報中所稱，中共藉旅大二地區增加兵力一節，亦毫無根據，因該區並無中共軍隊。又中國派兵至旅順海軍基地，係違反中蘇協定第四條，該條為中國將防務委託與蘇聯，因之自不准中國軍隊駐屯該區。又關於大連之協定，亦不准中國駐軍巿區之內，而在對日作戰時期，大連應受戰時海軍區之戰時政府管理。目前對日和約尚未締結，仍處對日作戰狀態，故大連仍歸軍政府管理。蘇聯政府對中國政府所稱中國在該地之政府，如無中國軍隊協助，即不能執行任務一節，認為無何理由，因蘇聯政府允許中國派往該地之警察，即可充分維持秩序故也。蘇聯在支持及以軍事援助予中國政府以及尊重中國在東北三省之主權等方面，均已履行其義務，在東北三省內肅清日軍，其後為尊重中國之主權，而又撤退其軍隊」。</p>
<h3>水利工程局與行總合力　疏導黃泛區積水　計劃已擬定即可施工</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封十三日電〕黃河水利工程總局局長陳泮嶺，鑒於黃泛區積水橫流，有礙難民歸耕，聞已商得行總豫分署之同意，合組泛區水利工程督導委員會，決定施工辦法。工程範圍，以賈魯河系南部水道為限，包括賈魯河以西，雙泊河以南，沙河以西之三角地區。施工計劃，因資料不全，暫依黃河原有之初步計劃擇要擬訂，並以工款五十億，工糧五千噸，於本年底完成。工程隊之經費及組織，由分署在泛區水利經費五十億內提十億為管理費，並就黃河水利工程總局在泛區測量隊之六隊中，以四隊專辦測量。另二隊改組為工程隊，再增設一隊，辦理施工事項，所有員工待遇，一律照總局待遇，加百分之五十，並聞最近即可開始施工，俾十年來之泛區，變為溝渠縱橫之樂園。</p>
<h3>黃河流經川境？　川參議員馬必杰如此說</h3>
<p>〔中央社成都十三日電〕據松潘籍之川省參議員馬必杰與記者談，黃河自巴顏喀喇山發源後，一般人均認為流經青海，甘肅，陜西九省，殊未盡然，緣黃河自青海巴爾喀喇山發源後，折而東南下流，經四川松潘所稱三河壩，復折而北上，流入甘肅，黃澡在四川之流域，約長三百餘華里，並有一河套，該縣境內生番所收之牛羊馬等飲水食草，均賴於此。松瀋地形似蛇，自松潘縣城西上，至崑崙山脈，長度約二千餘華里，該地人民純屬生番，迄今過太古遊牧生活，毫無文化可言，素不與外界通往來，故黃河上游之流經川境罕為世人所知。馬氏此說，未知然否，殊値得地理學者之探究。</p>
<h3>滬海軍造船所　被裁工人請願</h3>
<p>有關機關商解決辦法</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕滬高昌廟海軍江南造船所，被裁工人請願團代表樂俊餘一行六人，來京向各有關部會請願後，十三日是午二時招待記者，報告其請願五要點：（一）要求政府補助造船經費，（二）要求政府迅速撥給外匯五十萬元，（三）要求保障職業，（四）要求被裁八百工人復工，（五）反對調班。海軍總部對渠等甚同情，唯以國內器材缺乏，該部經費拮据，此問題未能獨力解決，俟與其他各機關接洽後，再為答覆。請願團代表十四日將續向國府，立法院，國防部，及社會部勞動局請願。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕行政院各機關為解決江南造船所工人被裁問題，將於十四日下午三時在社會部集議，屆時出席代表為社會部組訓司陸司長京士，勞動局孫副局長伯　，國防部第六應錢廳長元孚，財部周主任秘書雍能，中央組織部彭秘書爾康，中央農工部工運處袁處長其烱，會議將由甘秘書長用光主持。據悉：會中或將涉及日本賠償我國造船設備之處理原則問題，蓋前宋子文長政院時，曾擬利用該項設備，在吳淞另設一上漲造船廠，海軍當局即以江南造船所頗有歷史，且承接商船修造，亦為其正常業務，擬請以賠償設備擴充江南造船所，故該原則久懸不決，近江南因銅鐵無着，業務不振，乃不得不有裁工之舉，該會若能就此原則有所決定，並解決造船材料之供給問題，配以日方賠償設備艦隻陸續運來，裁工問題當可連帶解決。</p>

<p>中常會議於九日通過黨團統一組織，其理由為統一革命陳綫加强黨團力量，齊一步驟，戡平匪亂。白部長於青年團成立九週年紀念日，勗勉青年說：「我革命陣營，亦尚有封建遺孽存在其間，團長遠矚高瞻，故最近復有明確訓示，必須將黨團合併，澈底改造本黨，始能統一力量，以與剿匪國策相配合，乃在適應現階段革命的需要，亦是黨團新生的良機。」這是一種改造團務黨務，以適應時勢需要的明快決定。</p>
<p>三民主義青年團，成立於民國廿七年，是年三月廿九日，國民黨臨時全國代表大會決議，修改黨章，加列第五條：「本黨為訓練青年，設三民主義青年團。」是年六月十六日，蔣主席兼團長，發佈告全國青年書，並公佈團章；八月一日自團長以下，宣誓入團，從此青年團以如火如荼的勢力，進行國策，參加抗戰，在前綫流血，在後方流汗，曾經寫過光芒萬丈的詩篇，令人感奮歌頌。</p>
<p>當抗戰最吃緊的末期；中央發起十萬青年慫軍運動，青年聞風響應，　袖奮起，請纓殺賊，不崇朝而被　入伍者，逾十五萬人，而由青年團各級所號召應徵者，即達九萬三千餘人，超過原配額幾達一倍，卒致鼓勵軍民，騙除强敵，　得勝利，迨抗戰勝利，敵區各級青年團組織，由秘密活動轉為公開活動，協助國軍接收，配合政府復員工作，壓功至偉。</p>
<p>當此共匪全百叛國，肢解民族，國內行　期近，國際思想劇鬥，中樞為加强革命陣容，集中革命力量，黨團必須一元化，黨員團員必須一家化，這極吻合於蔣主席所謂：「中國國民黨是國家的動脈，而三民主義青年團是動脈裏的新血輸，」動脈和新血輸，原屬一家，彼此絕對絕不可分，動脈是一切生命力量的發動機，血液是一切能力的源泉，國民黨年長，恐懼動脈硬化，加入了年輕的青年團的新血輸，自可產生日新又新的作用，這是黨團新生的重要　　。</p>
<p>黨和團本無彼此，領袖相同，主義相同，思想一致，目的一致，現在工作又相仿佛，團接受黨的領導，黨扶助團的發展，一向是殊途而同歸，今後形成一體，更是同舟共濟，團參加了黨的組織，黨得到了團的新力軍，更應發揮力量，六十年來的青年運動，始終是革命運動，第一個時期，是掃除專制政體，創造中華民國，第二個時期，為打倒軍閥，統一國家，第三個時期，為一面抗戰一面廢除不平等條約，今日已踏進第四個時期，也是後期的革命運動時期，主要工作，在戡平共匪，行憲建國，這是黨團新生後的新工作，却是革命的一貫舊使命。</p>
<p>黨團的如何統一？如何併家？中央已決定組設「黨團統」組織研究會」和「黨團統一組織委員會」分別研討實施，無庸詞費，但有一點要注意，彼此應成淮一的組織體，必須成為「化合」的組織體，免得再立門戶，各分彼此，同時希望黨方幸勿「依老賣老」，而要「老當益壯」，團方要力避「血氣方剛」，而該帶一些「少年老成」以便水乳融洽，一致對外，這次蔣主席在青年團九週年紀念，剴切訓勉稅：「應認職目前革命環境與革命責任之重大，本自我批判精神，徹底檢討過去，改進一切缺點，加强革命組織，並嚴肅紀律，與集中力量，以掃除革命障礙」，必如此，才能完成革命的大業。</p>
<h3>社法國國慶</h3>
<p>今天是法國國慶，在一百五十八年前的今天，法國人民英勇進攻巴士的獄，推翻了法國的君主　愷，創立了第一次共和；並發表「人權宣言」，「以自由·平等·博愛」為口號，向世界各國的人民號呼，從此各國的革命運動風坡雲湧，都是受了法蘭西革命的感召而造成的。今天我們慶祝法國的國慶，除了景仰法蘭西大革命的精神而外，對於法國大革命的理想——自由·平等·博愛·尤為我們所崇拜。</p>
<p>自由·平等·博愛的口號，雖已呌了一百五十八年，但是至今尚未全部實現；以法國本身言，雖然經過了四次革命，成立了四個共和政體；但是一七八九年法國大革命時所憧憬的理想，還沒有完全實現，戰後的法國，在表面上看來，是進步了，左傾了，但是按之實際，遠開法國革命的理想，尚有相當的距離，賴瑪迪埃內閣，雖然是一個舉國一致的聯合政府，但是共產黨最近忽又退出了政府，成為有名無實的聯合政府，法國政府天天有發生政潮的可能。在經濟方面，法國在大戰之後，精疲力盡，至今還是瘡痍滿目，欲在廢墟中復興，如果沒有外國的援助，都是無濟於事的。同時法國對於海　殖民地，仍採取以前帝國主義的態度，對越盟採取高壓政策，就是一個絕好的證明，所以我們對於法國第四次共和政府的前途，也是不十分樂觀的。</p>
<p>我們再以自由·平等·博愛三句口號來權衡目前的世界，更覺得人類的進步，實在太慢了。自法國大革命以後，各國的革命運動，有如雨後春筍，不是對外要求獨立民族運動，就是對內要求民主的革命運動；但至一百五十人年後的今天，放眼看看世界各國的情形，還有許多國家，在表面上雖然獨立了，自主了；但是仍不免要做大國的附庸，內政旣要受其干涉，外交也不能自主。最近歐洲若干國家不能自由決定參加歐洲經濟會議，就是一個有力的鐵證。</p>
<p>由此可知，法蘭西大革命的理想，不論從法國本身說，或從世界各國說，雖經人類一百五十八年的奮鬥，但至今還沒有完全實現，尚有待世界各國人民的共同努力，爭取自由·平等·博愛的實現！</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕此間英國方面消息靈通人士本日談稱：預料歐洲經濟會議至本月十六日，可望有極大之進展。屆時具文外相即能遄返倫敦數云。</p>

<p>〔合眾社巴黎十二日電〕據此間權威方面息：英法國國擬在巴黎會議結束之前，再向蘇聯及眞東歐諸國作最後籲請，邀彼等在過遲之前及時參與馬歇爾計劃。此項籲請或可緩和對於馬歡爾計劃之外交反攻。傳蘇聯正計劃在莫斯科主持之下組織東歐堅較經濟集團。關於兩日前此間美國高級官員所稱此次巴黎會議乃「最後之邀請」，凡不作答　之任何國家均不能享受馬歇爾計劃之援助。另據華府方面消息，則謂援助之門戶依然洞開。英法兩國諸領袖對此認為顯有米獲協議之處而深表憂慮，並希胡權威方而從速澄淸此點。</p>
<h3>企圖破壞馬卿援歐計劃　蘇終將心勞日拙　美決心對付蘇任何挑撥</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美國官方人士今日稱：蘇聯企圖分裂歐洲及破壞馬歇爾援歐計劃，終將心勞日拙，一無所成。據聞蘇聯集團各國雖拒不參加巴黎經濟會議，但仍願分享美國對歡之經濟援助。美國今後之態度大抵如下：（一）美國政府決心盡力支持巴黎會議產生之合理的歡洲復興計劃，蘇聯如何反對，在所不計。（二）美國政府此際不欲與蘇聯在政治與經濟關係上，及在聯合國機構中，强迫攤牌。但將對付蘇聯勢力之任何挑撥。（三）美國政府或將權促美蘇間若干縣案之解決，如匈牙利政局及巴爾幹局勢等。此種問題殆爲本年九月間聯合國大會例會中之重大爭執。（四）會美國政府此際不願關閉東歐與西歐間合作之任何道路。美國並不承認固定的東方與西方集團。（五）目前歐洲之角逐，乃美于蘇間全部政治與經濟資源之試鍊，亦即美國資本主義與民主制度與蘇聯共產主義與獨裁制度之爭。此種試鍊將賡續多年，歐洲經濟很興，爲其中一階段，但關係則極重大</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美政府及杜魯門總統之顧問已不懼一九四七年中問全國商業之衰落，反轉而研究美國之高度經濟是否將趨向通貨膨脹一路。政府經濟專家多數皆曾預言，七月一日以後物價將稍低落，現在則多預測至八九月問，物價將重見高峯。據戶口調查局報吿，六月份美國平民就業者達六千萬人，無論花平時或在戰時均屬高峯，因此不致有立時衰落之處，而此一大羣有業者之收入及購贊力，實爲杜魯門總統於年中報吿國家經濟時所必須考慮者。此項報吿下星期即將送交國會。總統之經濟顧問委員會已於昨日向總統及內閣提出繁榮問題之各種事實，以灰各項數字與預測，頗以國家對於通貨膨脹潮之抵抗力，恐將鬆弛爲慮。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦十二日電〕此間外交界相信，若英蘇商業談判決裂，蘇聯將以其本年豐收之麥類，輸往其衛星國。雖則市詼各國拒絕出席巴黎會議，但表示希望能獲得外國借款。</p>

<h3>「官邸」訪問「女推事」　丈夫是一位青年進出口商人　謝媒引起意外風波　她聲明從未說過是「推事」的話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕福建南路金陵東路吉安里二八二號，門口有一隻信箱，一邊寫「祝丕業」，一邊寫着「黃方白」步上三樓，便是喧傳一時的冒充女推事案生角祝黃方白（見圖）的閩房。記者為了一探本案究竟，昨日冒雨往訪。</p>
<p>迎面走出來的是黃夫祝丕業，穿着　衫西裝褲，樣子很幹練。招呼我們坐下來之後，黃方白（報載貨芬白實誤）也走出來，脂粉不施，雙眉緊蹙，身着紅藍相間大花朶綢旗袍，體格頗為健美，　一　藍底鑲銀花拖鞋。記者將來意吿知以後，他們把事情的經過原原本本的說出來：</p>
<p>祝丕業是福建人，今年二十九歲，曾肄業貴陽大夏大學政治系三年級。黃方白是江蘇海門人，今揮廿五歲，南京東方中學初中部畢業。二十九年因爲祝的父親在滬逝世，祝遂由貴陽趕同上海奔喪，他的父親是做進出口貿易的，視是長子，遂繼承了他父親的事業，往來上海和廈門，代客買賣華洋百貨。卅年祝黃結婚，現已有三個小孩。</p>
<p>月月前有蘇州人何鎭，經黃介紹一女友與何結婚。何爲謝媒起見，於上月廿八日邀黃至靑梅居吃晚飯，飯後又的黃至馬當路維納斯舞廳聽聽音樂。因何夫婦有事他往，黃一人先候於維納斯，獨坐品茗，竟被隣桌舞客周家華等四人疑為舞女，寫條要求共舞。何鎭來後即責問周等不應調戲良家婦女，致起衝突，經嵩山警察局帶去訊問，將周等四人　斥，命具結了事。</p>
<p>此事本已告一段落，不料次日某報竟刋黃係女推事消息，引起軒然大渡。據黃表示，伊在警局中從未說過是「推事」的話，可査警局筆錄，她一面請李樸律師登報聲明，一面拍電至廈門請伊夫祝丕業趕回上海。本月八日突接地檢處傳票，前日在地檢處傳訊，直至現在為止，她也不明白究竟為什麽一頂女推事帽子加在她頭上。她說：「黃亮我根本不知道這個人，地檢處女檢察官黃　平我是認識的，但從來沒有用她名字招搖過」。</p>
<p>祝丕業在旁邊又補充幾句：「犯罪也得要有證據，她　充女推事，這句話在什麽地方說過？什麼人受害過？有沒有吿發人？不能隨便使一個人受寃屈！為了這件事情，我的精神上事業上都受了很大的影響。我的母親為這件事煩惱，住到外邊去了。我們很希望輿論界有公正的報道，俾此案能早日水落石出。譬如說有的報上說我曾任軍職，事實上我自貴陽回上海後就經商至今，從未任過軍職」。至於有一夏姓曾向地檢處密吿事，伊稱亦有所聞，但並不識夏姓其人。</p>

<h3>美國花旦生還匿名怪函失蹤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一度盛傳在蘇自殺之「美國花旦」華達，現已證明此事為惡作劇性質。記者昨日曾晤見華達本人於其寓內，談及往事，不禁啞然失笑。據華談稱：渠本人自青島返滬，尙爲兩週前事，此次赴蘇，原爲應邀演唱，但以種種關係，未便允諾，或因此而爲某人所誤會，開此「玩笑」也。至寄給新　琴之匿名怪信，因經多人傳觀後，現已遍尋無着。華對此謂：渠已兩度前往新麗琴處，希望能獲得原函，迨騐明筆跡，眞相定可大白。</p>

<h3>俞叔平播講　經濟警察　須具精湛學識廉潔操守　方能戮力以赴發揮效能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座新滬電台，舉辦第十五次星期日特別廣播，請市警察局兪代局長叔平播講「經濟警察」，茲悉錄其演詞如下：</p>
<p>經濟警察為協助政府執行國家經濟決策曁防止一般經濟上犯罪行為之强制權力作用。所謂經濟犯罪行為，即以經濟手段違比有關經濟管制法令之行為。由於經濟犯罪含有刑事性質，屬於刑事警察之範園，與專以取締違禁行為之營業警察，有本質上的分別最先有經濟警察設置之國家，為第一次世界大戰後期之德奧同盟國。因為　奧海口受到協約國艦隊的對鎖，物資來源斷絕，國內原有物資不够分配，而慣於投機之猶太商人，復利用機會囤積操縱，致形成經濟極度恐慌。德奧政府為謀解救是項危機起見，經於一九一七年設置經濟警察，專責於經濟犯罪之防止。後雖因設置時間過　，無法挽救經濟的崩潰，但經濟警察之重要性—尤其在戰時，　　我們忽視。</p>
<p>國計民生觀念淡薄</p>
<p>我們中華民國是一個十足自由經濟的國家，政府為了爭取抗戰勝利，於民國二十七年十月頒佈了非常時期農礦工商管理條例，其目的，亦在於統制戰時的經濟。政府為實施是項計劃起見，先後設立許多機構，如農本局，物資局，國家總動員會，花紗布管制局，糧食部以及各省之物價管制局，糧食運輸局，生產局。然而政府雖曾設置了上述許多機構，決心經濟管制，但物價却仍是節節高漲。物便高漲之原因固非一端，但其主因之一即為中國人民向在自由經濟的社會中生活慣了，種種生產向以個人意志為中心，而以賺錢為目的，國計民生的觀念，非常淡薄。現以生產方面來說，戰時除兵工廠紗廠之外，其他生產事業皆無法作嚴格的管制。有錢的人任何高貴的東西都可設法買到，無錢的貧苦階級，連吃白米飯亦成問題。此種生產無計劃，分配不平均的情形，直到勝利以後的今天，還存在着！</p>
<p>管理物價實爲要着</p>
<p>至於戰時消費，應避免一切不需要之浪費，同時使每人除了維持生活必需品以外，都能節省下來　供求二方面得以平衡。我們要為　　戰局着想，自非勵行節的不可，但我國在自由經濟狀態之下，一般貧　級，其所需物品，無法得到，同時對現存物品數量，也沒有確實之統計，可作根據，在戰時要嚴格管理，實在是一　很困難的工作因為物資管理困難，所以不得不從物價上去管理，這是消極的辦法，也是無可奈何中的辦法。物價計劃經濟社會中，根本無管制的必要，但在自由經濟社會中，管理物價，其意義較為重大，因為物價是生產，分配，消費等之樞紐，物價的昇降旣可刺激生產，又可調劑分配，更能伸縮消費。換言之，如能控制物價，即可控制生產，分配與消費。故在自由經濟社會中管制物價實為要着。</p>
<p>經濟犯罪行爲分析</p>
<p>經濟犯罪行為之確定，除普通刑法所明白規定者外，尙須視其有否違反有關經濟，財政，金融等管制之法令，在抗戰期內頒佈甚多。</p>
<p>違犯上列各項法令之行為，或爲違反行政命令之行為，或爲違反特種刑事管制法令之行為。凡違反行政命令之行為由行政機關處辦；如違反特種刑事管制法令之行為，則由司法或軍法機關審理，　　違反取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法第十七，十八條或違反國家總動員法第十六條之規定者，原由軍法機關辦理，現則改屬普通司法機關。</p>
<p>至於違反管制之行為，約有（一）囤積居奇（二）不遵照規定營業（三）投機操縱（四）逃避統制（五）不當利得（六）抬高物價工資或房租（七）濫開定期支票膨脹信用（八）冒牌摻雜（九）改變度量衡（十）暗中競爭（十一）逃避稅收（十二）俞運物資等等。關於犯罪行為之處罰標準，除依照上節所述各項法令之規定辦理外，並得由當地政府依據事，時，地的實際情形，予以處置。正因為上項法令多數具有時間性，所以有許多經濟行為在戰時認為違法，犯罪，但在平時却無何種關係。自經濟緊急措施方案實施後，有許多戰時經濟，金融等管制法令，現又加强其效用了。</p>
<p>經濟警察基本工作</p>
<p>執行管制法令，防止違反管制法令之行為，固為經濟警察之主要任務；惟對於重利盤剝，詐欺取財，侵占背信，惡性破產犯罪行為，雖在普通刑法內己有明確規定，但因其犯罪行為，乃係利用經濟手段而實施，故防止和偵查是項犯罪行為，亦為經濟警察應負之任務。然而經濟警察人員，如欲達成是項任務，必須完成下列各項經濟警察之　本工作：1戶口之調査與統計。2人口，貨物移動之登記。3　資調査統計。4商店賬冊之審核。5工會或公會組織之加强。6市塲，工廠，農塲，倉庫，公司，錢莊等等之監督管理。</p>
<p>完成了上述　本工作，然後經濟警察即可依據聯權去推行政府管制經濟之決策。去維護政府經濟管制法令之威嚴。</p>
<p>經濟警察組織訓練</p>
<p>經濟性犯罪行為之範圍甚廣，影響甚大，負責此種任務之警察人員，必須具有較高的知識水準。除需精硏法律及經濟學，並熟悉經濟地理以外，對商塲上普通習慣，以及商人心理與行為亦需明瞭。所以一個經濟警察人員並非是一個普通警官學校的畢業生所能勝任，而須選拔學習農，工，商，會計，稅務，經濟等專科學校畢業學生，再加上偵査技術之訓練，方能勝任。如欲在舊有警察幹部中挑選經濟警察，則非易易。</p>
<p>總之，經濟警察是現代化的警察，是需具有精湛學識，廉潔操守，幹練才能的警察，任務繁重，責任艱巨，國家經濟秩序能否安定，政府管制法令能否實行，與經濟警察的良　　有莫大關係。在經濟危機嚴重，物價波動劇烈的現階段，經濟警察應發揮最大效能，監督社會澈底實行經濟緊急措施方案，防止人民經濟犯罪行為之發生，　力以赴，始克有濟。</p>

<h3>葉觀雄力疾登塲　惜敗於陶冠球　港網球賑災賽南北兩雄會面</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕港賑災網球義賽，最後一塲，七日那天，由於葉觀雄的力疾登塲，四雄會戰，遂得在中華游樂會塲舉行。</p>
<p>首由徐煒培王文正對打，「大徐」演出優奐，長抽短截，使王文正無法招架，在第一盤中，文正輸去兩局穢，僅勉力扳成二二平手，即被「大徐」迎下四局，以二比六先失一盤。第二盤開始，「大徐」以三比一領前時，文花小休後，精神特佳，擔回兩局，成三比三，很後勁不繼，復被「大徐」再取荒局，六比三終塲，煒培奪得兩盤勝利。在這塲比賽當中，文正確盡了最大努力，雖在最後一局中，仍努力掙扎，精神可嘉。</p>
<p>壓軸戰，「小葉」扶病上陣鬥陶冠球，的確，在這兩盤交戰中，除了在開始的三局裏，「小葉」能够控制戰局外，其他是冠球佔盡優勢。我們可以看到，冠球的底綫長抽，確非易於壓倒，同時出球的功夫，也異常刁鑽，若「小葉」精神如昔，對打起來，必有可觀。事實上，「小葉」因氣虧而失常，他的「看家」本領，上網　截，自殺落網，達八次之多，而發「死球」亦有五次，於是被冠球連敗兩盤，結果是六比三，六比二。至於發出「愛司」球，則葉，徐各有五次打出，陶王俱得兩次。</p>
<p>王，陶日內即啓程返滬，計所得戰果，陶冠球在單打中先後擊敗江道章，徐煒培，葉觀雄，收獲至佳。</p>
<p>葉觀雄則於短期內赴美國，被服務之洋行派去，以他的身手，能在美國磨練一番，將來定有無限成就。</p>

<p>有資格人士，十三日對日本政府定擬今年度中日貿易計劃加以評論，認爲日本仍圖以價廉質劣之商品，向中國傾銷。依據該項計劃，日本欲於其恢復對外貿易之八月十五日起，至年底之三個半月中，自中國取得五千一百六十餘萬美金之出超收益，此點殊値吾人注意。雖然由日本擬輸出中鬨之高品視之，若千稱類商品決難獲得我國政府之輸入許可，而其擬自我國購買之貨物，如煤及大豆等，屆時我國能否供給，尙須視局勢決定。故談項計劃能實現至何種程度，殊難預斷。惟由此吾人當可獲得警惕，即日本雖彼擊敗，其工業生產量仍極可觀，若彼挾大量廉價之商品向我國傾銷，勢將成爲我國民族工業之致命打擎，我國政府必須妥謀對策。</p>
<h3>所利得稅抽查開始五金等業日程已定</h3>
<p>本市三十六年度第一類營利事業所得稅之稽征，前因工商業負担及查帳風紀等問題，其普遍查帳征課工作，曾一度和緩。嗣經市商會代表赴京，向中樞切實建議標準簡化辦法，財次徐柏園氏及直接稅署署長王撫洲氏，又迭次來申調查眞相，決定改爲抽查制度，於上週之末，吊查五金，進出口，呢羢，紙，顏料，等五業帳簿一百三十三戶，預定於本星期內查畢，再陸續抽查其他各業。</p>
<p>聞此五業共有報稅單位二千餘戶，前此已經查帳者，約有五百戶，故此次僅抽查其營業額年在四億以上者如上數。即將　二次查定之標準低益率，作爲各該業全體之課稅標準。則較之先前辦　，凡免查一千數百戶。如工作順利，再轉查其他各業，官方曾表示須於二三個月內查畢云。</p>
<p>市商會曾　請當局：（一）拆舊盤　　銷，　重視商界合習　，儘量從寬。。存款（即拆款）利息所　稅，　　着借用人賠　。（三）查　　　　　　　　　，並請准同　公會及商會　代　會查，當局　表示接受。上週末商會代表在稅局，亦曾　申前　，並對於前　查定之戶，在將其結果採用爲各該業課稅標準時，請予公吿及商會代表以覆閱之機會。日來各業公會對於稅局之重行展開查帳工作，極爲重視。惟情緒之能否安定，胥視五業查定之結果爲斷　據有資格之觀察家談稱：五業之抽查，大致可無磨擦。尤其爲呢絨顏料二業，已查者爲二百六十餘戶，待查僅二十餘戶，應可不生問題。但總須官商二方皆能平心靜氣，衡情酌理，方克有　云。有關方面透露消息，五業在本星期內之指定送查日期，爲呢絨星期一，五金星期二，紙星期三，進出口星期四，顏料星期五。局方荒在充實人事，鄭重應付</p>
<h3>中農改善繭貨　開始辦乾繭質押</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行所舉辦之繭貸手續，按過去與喊商所訂合河，祇有一次，即申貸款項若干，至結束時償還方法，繳款或繳絲兩者聽便。本年中農銀行鑒於鮮　貸款中心，向集中於上海一埠，而各廠在蘇杭嘉湖一帶，於乾　　　期間，滬行管環頗感困難，爲便利計，現改由就地各分行辦理。是以本年農行繭貸，規定鮮繭部份仍在上海，至翰黃質押，則由分行處理。</p>
<p>又悉：該行爲希各廠早日開工起見，在鮮　賬務未完全結束前，得將已進倉之乾　，先向各地農行訂約開工，截至目前止，業已開始辦理，其總額仍係於　貸總額兩千七百億元中分配之。</p>
<h3>輸廣會計割收購　川粵兩省生絲</h3>

<h3>捲烟市勢回挫</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况。晨開即呈虛軟，蓋聞永泰和於加稅前仍有大量派貨，外埠同行亦有發配，塲內人心頓吿虛怯，買戶觀望。更兼銀根帶急，吐　頻起，終在暫售情勢下，十支大英烟比上日回降十萬元許，爲八百八十餘萬元。老刀亦降七八萬元，爲七百七十五萬元，塲上成交甚稀。</p>
<p>其餘華商烟價亦跟踵下挫，美貨條烟及五十支　裝烟亦帶疲軟，收後聞大英烟喊價在八百八十五萬元尙乏受主，廿支每條四萬零五百元有賣，美麗五萬二千六百元，白蘭地三萬四千元，雙斧二萬六千七百元，老刀每箱七百七十五萬元，祗有賣戶，並無買主。</p>
<h3>受原料缺乏影響　橡膠業面臨危機　本市廠家已有局部停工者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據換膠業公會負責人吿記者：橡膠業現已遭受原料缺乏之困難。本年二月至四月，橡膠進口限額爲五十六萬美元，約可進口生膠一千噸。但上海一個月之實際需要，即在二千噸左右，平時不足之數依賴香港至華南間之轉口貿易接濟。但自七月份起，此類轉口亦經禁止，故今後橡膠工業已發生原料不足之危機，本市廠家已有局部停工者，甚盼有關當局能注意及之。</p>
<p>同時，半年以來，橡膠業所用之谷種原料價格，上漲已在五倍以上，但成品之價格不過提高一倍左右，太不成比例。且因內戰之擴大，東北華北銷塲縮小，農村購買力喊退，凡此種種均使橡膠工業維持困難。前傳鄧祿普車胎擬在華傾銷一節，因外匯及輸入管制關係，不致成爲事實。事實上，自由車胎及三輪車胎，我國已能自給：汽車胎則大中　橡膠廠已能製造。同時瀋陽靑島台灣三地，均接收有大型之汽車胎廠，惜以種種關係，目前均陷於半停頓狀態中。將來如能全部開工，則汽車胎亦能自給，不必仰賴外貨。</p>
<h3>津市地毯業　國外銷路漸暢</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津十三日電〕津市將瀕絕境之地毯業，茲以國外銷路漸暢，現已獲得一綫生機，若干外商及津市華商，正以大批地毯出口。鼎盛時期，津市之地毯工廠曾達二三百家，二次大戰期中，相繼凋罕，迄今僅餘八千餘家。主要原料係採用西北原毛，故成本過高，成爲當前推廣銷路之最大困難。此外，日本前曾派遣女工來華學習織造地毯技術，目前已有日本製出之地毯運銷美國市塲，而土耳其及越南亦有地毯出產，於海外形成競爭局面，凡此當爲我地毯業之穩慮，有待努力克服。</p>
<h3>經濟部陳部長邀宴紡調委員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟郃部長陳啓天，於昨晚七時許，邀宴紡調會各委員，吳市長亦應邀赴席。陳部長曾就政府頒佈動員令很，紗布調節施策應切實配合之意旨，暢述一過，旋與出席各委員交換章見很散席。陳氏即於昨日乘晚車晋京。</p>
<h3>肥皂喊價見小</h3>
<p>昨日用品市面回挫，同業到塲因天雨甚稀，交易亦淸，開價頓見喊小。黃祥茂皂比上日乹降二千元，爲三十三萬八千元，收後市　更軟，聞某大戶喊三十三萬三千元，有大額吐售，但乏受主。此外固本箭刀　利牛牌等皂，亦各跌五千至萬元不一，火柴市亦趨疲，惟洋燭則見挺秀。</p>
<p>皂燭原料燒堿步挺</p>
<p>昨日皂燭原料燒碱市面，因各方消化甚暢，市上現底不充，行情步趨堅挺。月牌燒碱每桶昻至一千三百五十萬，比上日續漲五萬元。美貨燒碱亦隨升四十萬，爲一千三百二十萬元。美貨司的令多頭吐售，每担疾瀉一百萬元，爲五百萬元，N松香每聽七十五萬，　低五萬元。高度白臘每担亦降十五萬元，爲一百六十五萬元，惟椰子油仍爲一百九十萬元。</p>
<h3>工商輔導處調查　化妝品工業槪況　提出五點認爲應加以改良</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商轉導處統計：本市化妝品公會會員，共計一二九家。各家之間生產設備技術水準相去甚遠，出品範圍，更形散漫。經輔導處調查結果，認爲有下列各點需加以改進：</p>
<p>（一）化妝品工業之製品，以牙膏，香皂，蚊香，花露水，爽身粉，潤膚劑等日用品爲主要，其他如香粉，胭脂，口紅唇膏，眉筆，產銷較狹，故化妝品並非純粹奢侈品工業，似應正名爲日用化妝品工業，以免一般人之誤解。</p>
<p>（二）香粉類製迭甚多，採用宮粉，例以鉛粉（碳酸鉛）爲原料。鉛劑有害肌膚，衛生當局似應檢騐，加以取締。而本業工廠尤應束身自愛，禁用此項原料，而代以鋅白鈦白，脂肪酸鋅爲佳。</p>
<p>（三）牙膏金屬歡管，含有錫鋅及鉛等多種金屬，其中以靑鉛質軟價廉，製造商貪岡厚利多用青鉛，使軟管製造，未合標準，牙膏黏附鉛毒有害衛生。衛生當局應仿飲食品成藥例，予以化騐，凡不合衛生標準者，一概華製。而合予標準者，則给予證明書，俾採購者有所抉擇。</p>
<p>（四）中法油脂廠等所製硬脂酸，五洲闔本廠中漢化學工業社大新化學廠等所產甘油，俱能符合標準，均可採用藉以提倡國產品。</p>
<p>（五）由敵偽遺留之五星肥皂廠，美華肥皂廠，香皂製造設備至爲完善。五星皂廠有自皂坏切片，烘乾，調和，研磨，軋條，打印等全部連續性自動裝置機械二套，美華有該種機械一套，及一二五噸皂鍋二隻可能產量極大。惜尙無甘油附產設備，以接辦未久業務尙未推廣尙環接辦人積橫推動俾能達到大量生產之目的。</p>
<h3>銀行業會員大會　規定提案日期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會第十四屆會員大會，已定於本月廿六日下午二時，假市商會舉行。該會已通函各同業，儘本月十五日前，將提案繕就一式兩份送會，以便提供討論。聞屆時除報吿一年來之會務狀供外，將討論修訂同業　規，特種營業稅，及所利得稅等問題。</p>
<p>又該會業規修訂小組會，會於日前下午四時，舉行會議。對銀行學會所擬供之業規討論藍本，咸主應增設署承一章，故已提交銀行　會再行增訂云。</p>
<h3>硫化元配額　輸管會決定原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會以第二季（五至七月）輸入限額，內硫化元一項，其限額之分配，頗有爭執。工業界方面，主張多配原料，以應工業之需要。商業界方面，主張多配成品，以應一般之要求觀點不同，意見亦異。經分配處召集　議委員會討論，雙方發表見解，均言之有理。最後持平取決，以限額百分之五十五，配給原料，以百分之四十五，配給成品，由工業用戶，與進口商分別承辦　入事宜云。</p>

<h3>三萬共軍的墳墓　四平焚屍記</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽六日航訊本報特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>鼻孔裏，突然闖進來一股燒焦和腐亂的氣息。俯瞰下去，四平擺在了飛機翼下。</p>
<p>低飛，鐵這綫旁，無數垜大豆，在燃燒，青烟縷縷，越往下落，越感烟氣逼人。</p>
<p>落在了四平西郊機塲，好多建築物和設備，在共軍兩度出進裏，毀壞的很慘重，應外還躺着幾架破壞了的飛機，現在完好的是跑道和一個飛機庫。</p>
<p>鐵西區域</p>
<p>跑向市裏去，穿過滿佈　壘的土城墻，在中山西路上，兩旁整然有序的房屋，被砲彈和炸彈炸轟洞穴累累，在初國軍堅守，遭遇共軍砲聯，後來共軍侵入，遭到空軍轟炸，這是有名的鐵西區戰塲一部。</p>
<p>電局一炬</p>
<p>電力局國軍一連人，被共軍由樓下縱火和投擲黃色炸藥，先全消滅，先是樓下被共軍侵踞，國軍逐步退據樓上，二樓，三樓，逐步抵抗，傷，死，結果同歸於燼！</p>
<p>電力局門前有無數共軍沒能搬走的屍體，和死去的戰馬，有的是赤褐色，漲起來了，有的被軋　了，　下了空的黑軀壳，在血泊和融化的脂肪質裏，橫七豎八的躺着，綠頭大蠅　集？</p>
<p>廣場白骨</p>
<p>從這折向南方，繞道轉向西南角，那是四平的廣塲，省府，市府，齊齊哈爾路局，都在這裏，這裏也更慘，市府門前階下，有死屍一堆，一兩具仰臥的，露着白色肋骨。</p>
<p>廣塲東北角，是國軍核心陣地，那是一所學校，為陳明仁將軍率部計劃死守據點，四圍工事構築得很堅固，很講究。</p>
<p>黃色炸藥</p>
<p>共軍對於這裏的攻佔，完全仰賴黃色炸藥爆破的力量，多數炸藥都是送到堡壘口裏，在堡壘前，看到共軍的遺屍，有的披着狗皮，有的裹着棉被，這是為了便於滾向堡壘的辦法，現在還有殘留着的長方型黃色炸藥的藥包，上而拴着一顆手溜彈，附着一個木桿，在那裏擱置着。</p>
<p>廣塲的週遭，斷垣殘壁，一片凄凉，夕陽中僅有成行樹木、葱綠暢茂，顯有生機，此外是全盤死寂。</p>
<p>大豆燃燒</p>
<p>天橋是鐵東鐵西連緊點，隆起的大橋上，壘着用大豆麻袋堆積的防禦工事。橋南一垜垜大豆，在燃燒着，燻得人人眼口難工，頭頂　着拍拍的槍聲，同時還有　隆轟隆的爆炸，烟氣，火光，槍聲，聯成一片，景象十分緊張。</p>
<p>鐵路東側，各　棧堆積大豆和雜糧，約計十萬多噸，這些金黃色的東北肥美產品，油質多，顆粒大，任它燃燒，無人施救，記者在四平兩天，為着這心疼着。</p>
<p>鐵東一瞥</p>
<p>過了天橋，踏上中山東路，黃豆　地，所有防禦工事，也是利用大豆麻袋堆壘，此外就是桌，椅，床，櫈和家具等　設的障碍物，這是國軍當時撤到鐵東州區後，恐共軍衝過天橋的阻碍設施。</p>
<p>鐵東區域，每個街道，每所建築物週圍，都有坑索和木椿；鐵絲網，木　　，更到處皆是，好像看到了小說上的「梅花　」「絆馬索」「入卦陣」，這在吿訴人們，國軍「步步為陣，屋屋為壘」，要在這裏死拚。</p>
<p>報紙上曾經登載過，共軍從南郊突入四平鐵東區東南角水源地和天主堂的消息，是的，國軍四平最後據點，鐵東區慘烈的拚死戰，就在這一帶。</p>
<p>常記者走進南一·二·三緯路和南一·二·三·四馬路的時候，看到的是：子彈，手溜彈，黃色炸藥包，棉花，衣帽，鞋　，死屍，毀滅！</p>
<p>一條呌做「重慶街」的爭　戰，更是慘烈空前。國共軍一條墻相隔、拋手溜彈相拚鬥，共軍挖地道，轟炸國軍，國軍拚死堅守</p>
<p>一個工車或房屋塌陷了，馬上修補起來、有時把屍體都摻雜在內，堡壘前是屍體，墻角門前。是屍體，當時雙方紅了眼。</p>
<h3>慘遭槍傷的老嫗　一度摔入地窖幸未喪命</h3>
<p>一個老婆婆前後　着血染了的白布，蹲在瓦　中，我問她：「怎樣了」？她說：「在一個深夜裏，國共軍打得太厲害，我們伏在地　裏，後來國軍退出了我們這個院落，共軍還在放槍，在投手溜彈。我和一位老太太，爬出來喊着：「這裏都是老百姓，不要打了，話未說完，拍的一槍，打入了前胸，接着一槍打入了後背，我拌到地窖裏，不省人事，現在竟還能活着！」</p>
<p>爬出地窖</p>
<p>四平的鐵西區，變成了瓦礫塲，鐵東區南面，一個角落，右同樣的情形，北部和東部，則多能保持原狀，同時這裏也多居民，但房屋多中了共軍的砲火。</p>
<p>這些人們從地窖裏爬出來，開始求活工作，逃難的人們，也扶老携幼從四而八方跑回來，好多的是無家可歸了，賴以活命的工作和事業都沒有了，滿面愁容，悽凉萬分！</p>
<p>乞援之手</p>
<p>東北行轅，　急賑東北流通　三千萬元，又墊潑了流通券五千萬元、遼北省主席劉　東，已伸出了求救之手，呼籲全國協助，他沉補的說：「善後難辦，放開軍人不說，四平人民和公敎人員，傷亡至少萬人以上，全市房屋十分之九毀於砲火，糧食損失十萬噸，同時有五萬人沒飯吃，四平的重建，更非四五十年不為功」！</p>
<h3>僞滿齋藤司令任共軍砲兵官</h3>
<p>四平血戰·共軍動員十數萬衆，五月廿日以後，形成對四平合　態勢，積極展開陷四平於孤立的戰事，後顧之憂消除，六月十一日，開始了　　四平。</p>
<p>官兵一致的　：「這次共軍的砲火。太厲害，太　　下一樹高，砲火就開始了，先打全面，作擾亂性射擊，　　　綫，第一綫，第二綫……，　後打點，點點不差！」</p>
<p>軍司令部人說：「夜裏，站在高處瞭望·統計共軍七生的五以上的大砲，足有八十多門，加上　色的共計二多多門」，後來知道中間有好多的日　　技術人員在一起。同時最重要的有前偽滿時日本四平駐屯軍司令　　担任砲兵指揮」。</p>
<p>「他們利用了新式指　槍，槍　在那炸，砲就往那裏打，抓到了一個放折揮槍的韓國人，還未得詳加詢問」，當把那個韓國人帶到記者眼前，因為他面無人色，據表示病得很厲害，未得詳知底細，還有一個自稱哈爾濱人的共軍，當時被人指出，他是韓國人，那個韓國人承認了。</p>
<p>傷亡三萬</p>
<p>國軍是六個　的兵力，在　西作戰的是八十八師，彭　率領新兵打，五十四師四個半營在鐵東區南部和共軍拚鬥，八十七師熊新民，在東北區防守，陣地完整，尤以北郊太平嶺高地防守最有功，據統計共軍傷亡三萬人，國軍犧牲也極重大。直到六月三十日，四平國軍　會師。</p>
<p>記者離開四平，在四平上空時，因四平正在焚屍，所以空中焦臭味越發濃厚，俯視四平，正為大豆焚燒汕烟所籠罩。</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>海南島新省區境界劃分之商榷</h3>
<p>— 諶亞達</p>
<p>關於中國省區的重劃，我們認為不需要大規模或全面的變更，而是主張就若干必須修正的地方予以局部調整的。最近政府決議海南島設立行政區域，並同時着手　備　省事宜，這是政府對於重劃省區一個適合時宜的措施。中國的省區，若能這樣按照實際需要整頓起來；則這重劃工作就輕易簡便多了。多年來喧嚷不已的劃省問題，藉此也可獲一妥善解決的指針。</p>
<p>不過，關於海南島新省區的疆域和境界，究應怎樣劃分並處理呢？這在現在省區尙未式式成立時，是値得我們在這裏商討一下的。政府指定海南島設置等政區域，這是建省過程中應採的一個步驟；到將來實行建省了，其範圍未必還祗是限於這一單獨的海島吧。政府在實施新制前，對於新省的境域疆界，想必會根據各種客觀條件來作周詳的考慮與合理的劉分的。</p>
<p>從地理的觀點，我們覺得海南島與其對岸大陸即雷州半島（相當於舊　州府）和廣東西南部（大體相當於　高州府，　州府，和欽州）是有辰齒相依與不可分的關係。而這部分卻與廣東主體相距遙遠·形成了一種孤立隔絕的形勢。所以把它　入海南島新省區，在行政上，似乎是很適當便利的事。</p>
<p>雷州半島和海南島間，僅隔以寬度十八公里的瓊州海峽（海安東南排尾角至海口東北灘頭間的距離）。兩方地勢　然如此密接，在秦漢時代，海南島就被最初移入徐　半島（雷州牛島南端）的人民迅速發現了。在這以前，更有苗傜族系的黎人，從大陸方面，穿過半島。依着一葦可航的海峽而到達島上，——這黎人現仍成為島上的主要土著居民，從而可知雷州半島和海南島的接近性）及其悠久的依存關係。</p>
<p>在地形上，這海峽也沒有形成眞正的阻隔作用。因為雷州半島和海南島北部，是屬於同一地形即所謂雷州海南平原的。雷州半島是一種起伏極微的波狀平原，依藉狹窄的水道幾與海南島北部平原直　接觸，地形旣然這樣類似統一，（地質上兩方亦多類似之點，茲不　，）人事政治自然難於分開了。</p>
<p>通過雷州半島，新省區領域更伸入廣東西南部即舊高州，廉州，欽州的地域。這樣把海南島和廣東西南部貫通起來，才能完成海陸雙方的聯合效用。雷州半島便是兩地的連鎖，具有中間陸橋的性質。</p>
<p>現在概括雷州半島的　雷州府和廣東西南部的舊高州府，廉州府，和欽州三區，我們總稱之為「高雷欽廉區域」。</p>
<p>這個區域和海南島之應聯成一省區，是因有下列諸理由：</p>
<p>（一）「高雷欽　」的北境，綿亘着一羣地質侵蝕已久的山地，其中較明顯的是勾漏山脈，（羅定以南）和西境的十萬大山等。依　這些山地，就與西江盆地相分離，形成西江流域以外的另一臨海斜面。這和海南島北斜面相對，很有呼應合一之勢。山地分水界略與高雷欽廉的北界相一致，爲劃分便利計，可把高雷欽廉的北界（政治境界）當作新省區的北界。（此處所稱北界，係指東起　江以西，西迄防城與安南接壤處的陸面境界，實包有極小部東西界在內）。</p>
<p>（二）氣陝上，廣東西南部與其他兩廣地方也不相同，是處在純熱帶範圍內而是帶着海洋性的。這點與海南島正屬於同一類型。</p>
<p>（三）本區臨海部是由島嶼·半島·岬角·海內組成的海陸綜合體。這與海南島相同，給予居民以海上活動的便利。</p>
<p>（四）本區與海南島的熱帶性，較其他兩廣地方更見加強；因而農業狀况亦顯示了不同之處。且因人口較稀，又富於各種礦藏，故兩區均富開拓發展的特性。</p>
<p>（五）海南島除環島海岸平原及其北部三分之一較平坦外，概屬叢莽被　的山區（冲積低地的缺乏，為一般海島的特性）。因此須加上對岸大陸平原的調劑，才有充分繁榮之望。這樣海南島固有賴於高雷欽廉區域，同時高雷欽廉亦是需要海南島才能顯出它的效用的。大凡一個臨海地帶要和海方多所接觸，幷引起居民對於海的興趣，則所謂「離岸島」（Off-Shore　Island）是不可缺少的。過去隱藏在西南角落的這個地方，有了海南島這麽大的「離岸島」，就不難增強本區及附近海岸的重要性了。</p>
<p>卓越的人地學家森帕爾女士（Ellen,C.Semple）在論述島嶼時，特注重「島嶼的政治分離」（Political　Detachability　of　Islands）一概念。大意說島嶼在地理上是個孤立區域，而在政治上是易於分離的。為了避免這個缺陷，在政治上，須使之結合大陸，以便其對大陸發生向心運動；依此法則，海南島和廣東西南部，也是儘可成一行政單位的。</p>
<p>構成海南島新省區，除上述兩部外，還應包含南中國海上的西沙·南沙兩羣島。在地理上，兩羣島較之廣東更接近本區；這劃分不僅在行政統治上，在地略學和地　政治上，也都感得需要。</p>
<p>依此，新省區所包括的是海南島，高雷欽廉區域和西沙·南沙兩羣島。計領有瓊山·澄邁·文昌·瓊東·樂會·臨高·　·崖·感恩·昌江·萬寗·陵水·白沙·樂東·保亭·定安·（以上在海南島）茂名·信宜·化·　江。電白。吳川·（以上舊高州府）遂溪·海康·徐聞·（以上舊雷州府）欽·防城·（以上舊欽州）合浦，靈山·（以上舊廉州府）等縣區幷廣州灣行政區域。其省會可設在新省主腦海南島上的瓊山。（東沙羣島仍隸屬廣東）。</p>
<p>在中國四千哩弧狀海岸的南北兩端，呈現了一種海陸交錯的相似形貌（兩端都擁有半島·島嶼·海峽·海灣·岬角·內海等），然而北端地方久已是中國史上一個扮演了許多動人劇目的舞台；而南端的這個地方，則冷落得幾被遺忘了。為要促使國人對於南疆的重視，（依今日太平洋地略形勢，南端的重要性幷不减於北端）。這個極南省區的建立，乃是具有深長意義的事。</p>
<p>國內論者往往以為高雷欽廉區域離省會太遠，似宜改隸廣西·以重國防，藉此廣西亦可分得出海之口。英國地理學家賴德氏（L.W.Lyde）也認為廣東東西兩端，即韓江流域和廣東西南部，（海南島在內）應分屬於福建和廣西。但依我們看來，母寗是廣東西南部和海南島合成一新省區。　於同一理由，韓江流域連同福建西南部可併入台灣省區，這樣劃分，似更適合妥當。</p>
<p>總之，對於省區劃界我們所持的見解，是同意海南島這樣局部整理的。我們不贊成全然推翻或無視固有境界而加以重新改革。最近地政部當局計劃效法美國州區用經緯綫來劃分省界（見本年六月十二日上海新聞報載李敬齋部長談話。）從種種方面看，這設計實在是不可能適用於中國。因為在歐亞大陸（Eurasia），文化悠久的國家——尤其是有久遠歷史性的中國，其政治境界總是由於長期　嬗演變而成的曲綫型式（使用經緯綫極少）。至於經緯度和方格形境界，則往往被用於新發現新開闢的土地（如美·澳·菲等洲），這差不多成了境界劃分上很普遍的例則。何况經緯綫並不是一種理想的境界，它本身就存在了許多缺點呢。</p>

<p>電信特刋　郁秉　題　創刋號　上海電信局業務處主編</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 郁秉堅</p>
<p>電信爲國營交通事業，亦公衆通訊之主要工具。復興以後，電信事業正力謀建設。本局因鑒於電信之攸關社會民生日常需要，而電信事業之發展，亦有賴於人民之共策共勵與協助推進，故當建設發軔之初，本局即以服務大衆爲主旨而欲與人民打成一片。</p>
<p>本刋發行，即　此原則，而其動機可歸納如下：</p>
<p>（一）公開電信技術與業務，以供大衆之探討。</p>
<p>（二）報道電信常識及介紹新興業務，以供採用。</p>
<p>（三）徵求建議與評判，以供本局今後興革之參考。</p>
<p>（四）答詢用戶質疑。</p>
<p>本刋係屬公開園地，甚冀海內宏達暨電界先進，不吝珠玉，時賜鴻文，以爲本局之南針，是則今後電信業務之得以進展，胥出大雅宏敎所賜，而今日本刋之問世，庶幾有深長意義存焉。</p>
<h3>國際通話恢復之前後</h3>
<p>— 伍正達</p>
<p>當勝利光降，接收不久的時候，電信最高當局，即開始計劃國際通話的恢復。去歲先行從事招訓國際話員，及整編國際通話章程及業務規章，値機用語等準備工作，惟因限於環境。且中美兩方，尚未商妥，故國際電話，一直延擱到本年三月，總局洽妥美國電報電話公司，同時由本局會同國際電台開始籌裝雙路單邊帶無綫電話機（2KW），於本局原有國內長台，劃闢國際通話交換室，裝置交換機及隔音設備，本年五月，相繼工竣開始試話</p>
<p>最初訂定會晤時間，爲上午十時至午後二時，及晚九時至午夜一時，經歷次試話，結果白晝因干擾强烈，通話至爲困難，不若夜間淸晰良好，爰決定自本年七月一日起，正式開放通話，時間暫訂爲晚九時至午夜一時（上海夏季時間），中國開放地點，暫定京滬兩地，美國可通達全美各地。</p>
<p>期待中的「七一」，終於來到，本局及國際電台主辦人員，均以興奮緊張的情　，來度過這一天。電信總局擬定之　　儀式，是請上海市吳市長首與舊金山市長，及中國駐美顧大使通話，繼由本局郁局長，國際電台宗管理工程師，與美國電報電話公司代表通話，互祝成功。</p>
<p>七月一日晚，主辦的人員們，奔波忙碌，滿頭是汗，自局長以次，均緊張地工作着，佈置禮堂，裝置擴音器，同時承中央電影攝影塲的同仁，來局協助，參加拍攝新聞片。九時左右，被邀請的新聞記者及嘉賓們，接踵蒞臨，招待員們，開始活躍起來，近十點鐘的光景，吳市長偕夫人蒞至，由局長接引至局長室稍事憇息後，儀式即在莊嚴肅穆的氣氛中，開始進行，會塲正中，懸掛着中美兩國的國旗，案上陳列着芬芳艷潔的鮮花，象徵着兩國間的邦交友好，及前途光大，司儀的小姐，以嘹亮的嗓音，揭開了儀式的序幕。</p>
<p>首先郁局長向市長及來賓們，以中英文致詞，一時閃電般水銀燈光及「開麥拉」響聲，不絕於耳。繼由吳市長致詞，市長瀟洒民主的風度，笑容談吐，深深地安慰了工作整日的人心，此時復話後，第一個國際電話開始由上海傳遞到太平洋彼岸的舊金山，擴音器傳出了雙方通話的聲音，使人滿意的，是話音如同市內電話一般地淸晰，市長與顧大使通話時，大使對溝通國際通話，深相讚許，依照預定程序，通話後閒放本局業務影片，略進茶點，這一幕歷史性的儀式，在友好快樂中完成。國際通話的恢復，能增加中美兩國的友誼，同時更證明了人類科學的力量，能克復自然的環境，它能使兩個相距遙遙於太平洋兩岸的人們，如相處一堂，親切談心，科學的進展，更縮小了宇宙的範圍。</p>
<p>轉瞬間，國際通話後，已達十天，原定同時開放兩電路中的一路，却因舊金山某電台之干擾影響通話，未能使用，現正向對方洽改週率，最近中美電話的需要量，日趨增加，以致供求相差懸殊，而不得不暫時停止掛號，俾能疏通已經掛號的電話，這當然是十分抱歉的，關於這一點，我們今後當竭力改善機綫之設備，以達到中美電話通暢之目的。</p>
<h3>本局電信業務槪況</h3>
<p>— 李桐</p>
<p>電信交通，乃國家之命脈，關係重大，自無待言，而上海復爲全國商業及經濟之重心，故本局所處之地位實綰國內外電信交通之總樞鈕。惟以戰時論人敵手，致優秀人才，散於四方，良好設備，破壞殆盡，勝利後，接收日方遺留之機件，類多陳　簡陋，加之材料缺乏，運輸困難，熟練人才，又不易　致，迭經規劃整理，幸已次第恢復且更有顯着之進展差可告慰於國人者。茲將本局業務概况，分述如下：</p>
<p>甲，電報部份。</p>
<p>有綫電：有綫電現有直達電路，計十七處。用快機者，有南京，杭州，福州，漢口，鄞縣，吳縣，鎭江等處。用音响機者，有無錫，嘉興，崑山等處。用話傳者，有松江，靑浦，嘉定，川沙，寳山，吳淞，南翔等處，南京係首都所在地，報務繁忙，除快機外，復有傳眞電報機及電傳打字機設備，藉增效率。快機係利用鍵盤鑿孔機，將電報　成有孔紙條，再用自動機傳送對方，對方收到時，收訊機錄出波紋符號之紙條，由打字員以打字機抄下送出，該機每分鐘最高可同時收發二百字（每字五個字母），惟以綫路關係現每分鐘平均可收發一百字。音响機係聽音抄收，每分鐘可發二十至二十五字。話傳電路，係以電話傳報，每分鐘可傳報二十字左右。電傳打字機，係最新設備，與尋常打字機，大致相同，發報時祗須按字撳打，對方即現淸晰之字母，可免重行抄寫之煩，每分鐘可收發六十字。傳眞電報，係由發報人以親筆　寫　文，於特備之電報紙上，利用電傳設備，將予跡於機上傳送對方，略經整理，即現清晰之親筆眞跡，故又名眞跡電報。</p>
<p>無綫電，無綫電現有直達電路計廿五處。用快機者有天津，北平，靑島，重慶，漢口，台北，廣州等處。用人工機者，有厦門，汕頭，福州，永嘉，定海，鄞縣，崇明，海門，南通，連雲，瀋陽，秦皇島，葫蘆島，南昌，長沙，衡陽，成都，昆明等處。無綫快機與有綫快機，形式及運用相同，惟前者係利用電波，由空中傳遞，而通暢時，每分鐘，可放報壹百二十字，惟電波千擾，及氣候變化時，則速度可能减至每分鐘三四十字。人工機係用手發耳聽，速率每分鐘約二十至二十五字，通訊情形，與無綫快機同。（電話部份待續）</p>

<h3>眞蹟電報之優點</h3>
<p>— 張有駿</p>
<p>查眞蹟電報，爲電傳圖像之一種，電傳圖像，原文爲Facsimile，係英國物理學家Alexander　Bain氏於西曆一八四二年所發明，後經長期之試騐，多方之研究，至一九一五年已漸見於商業上之應用，而在近十數年間，則歐美各國均已普遍設置，抗戰期間，重慶與紐約倫敦等地間，亦設有電傳圖像電路，戰後吾工商待興，眞蹟電報之採用與擴展，自屬不容忽略之事業。</p>
<p>該項電報，係於電信局規定大小之眞蹟發報紙上，由發報人隨意書寫文字圖案等，電局以該紙捲入特製之發訊筒上藉機器之光電作用經電波傳遞，俄頃間對方即能於收錄機上，以特製之收報紙收得所發電文，其字跡岡樣，與發報人所繪寫者，無損絲毫，可謂盡善盡美，非其他通信方法所可及，茲將其優點，縷述如次：</p>
<p>（一）正確因眞蹟電報之傳遞，全藉機器之光電作用，所發者乃直接取用發報人所寫之電文，對方所收得者，即其映像，故絕無普通電報之文字電碼互譯及人工拍發與抄收等錯誤，可稱絕對正確。</p>
<p>（二）迅速　凡處理普通電報所需之一切手續均可省去，自甲局發至乙局，　方僅數分鐘而已，收方祗需自收訊箇上取下收報紙，立即派專差投送，故迅速異常。</p>
<p>（三）經濟實用發報人可於規定用紙上儘量書寫，故字數多寡與報費無關，如小號發報紙之書有二三百字者，即能從容收發，較諸計字收費之普通電報，實經濟多多，該電報不論毛筆。鋼筆字（以黑墨水爲限）打字，均可應用，即圖案，表册，賬目等（在規定尺寸內）亦可傳遞。故如欲利用該項電報以表慶賀之忱者，不妨於用紙上加繪慶祝實意圖案，他若定貨電報，亦可繪入貨物尺寸式樣，均能依式傳遞，毫　勿爽。</p>
<p>（四）增加收發報人間感情電報猶如　信，藉以互通情愫。凡遇至戚密友舉行婚禮，雖可向電信局拍發交際電報，然如利用眞蹟電報，而於用紙上，書以簪花之體，輔以祝賀之圖，則對方接閱電報，定必欣快無限。他如關河游子，愛侶良朋，亦可覩文字之墨跡，慰魂夢之牽，訴衷曲於千親也。</p>
<p>以上各點，係述其　　大者，各界人士不妨一試。</p>
<p>茲附述改進意見二點，備供吾電信當局參考。</p>
<p>（一）據本市新聞社人員表示，前往各地新聞稿件，頗有思利用眞蹟電報，以代平素之新聞電報，徒以日前眞　電報通達地點，祗能充分利用。因思新聞事業爲國家之喉舌，自應與電信事業密切聯繫，以暢通訊。故爲擴充綫路，陸續開放平湋漢渝等繁忙地點及延長每日通電時間，則新聞界之廣爲利用，定可預卜。</p>
<p>（二）現統計眞蹟電報內容則以慶弔及其他　際性質者爲多。而該項電報收報紙，因屬特製紙張，紙面晦黯無光，如喜慶祝賀電報，能另製較該項收報紙略大之紙張，顏色作粉紅。四　繪以金色圖案，該項電報，自機上收下後，即黏其上，外套以同色美術　封，喜氣洋溢之禮廳中，彩電紛投，更能爲之生色不少焉。</p>
<h3>請儘量利用電信新辦法</h3>
<p>— 李季清</p>
<p>交通部電信總局近來積極改進電信業務，不遺餘力。爲檢討工作進展情形及計劃今後設施起見，曾於五六兩月，先後分批召集各區電信管理局及京滬平津武漢等重要城市電信局局長，舉行電信檢討會議，詳細硏討各項問題，務期達到電信爲公衆服務之目的。此外在局內並添設「公衆服務組」專辦電信爲公衆服務之事項。</p>
<p>最近電信方面實行之新辦法，爲數甚多，茲特撮要列舉如次，深望各界人士儘量多多利用，庶可於平日一般生活上及使用電報電話時，得到種種便利。</p>
<p>（一）服務台　各電信局均設有服務台專爲便利民衆答復關於火車，飛機，輪船等班次及當地娛樂廣播等節目之詢問。（電話一一五）</p>
<p>（二）電亭　設在各地車站碼頭風景區大會塲等處，內有電話設備，除辦理公用電話，長途電話業務外，並收受各種電報，由電話傳送至電信局報房拍發。</p>
<p>（三）汽車行動電局　各大城市開辦汽車行動電局，或營業處，或係由電信局自行辦理，或附設於行動郵局內，依照規定路綫，逐日按時行駛於各市區，停留收發電報。</p>
<p>（四）來報代譯　各大城市電信局對於來報均已代譯。收報人於接到電報後，即可閱讀明瞭，如有接得電報未經譯就者，可報告電信局（電話一一四九〇）。</p>
<p>（五）電話通知收取去報　各界人士如有電報發寄，請打電話一三〇五九，電信局派差將電報取去拍發。</p>
<p>（六）業務稽查　各大城市電信局均派有業務稽查員，經常訪問外界，調查接洽報話事宜，各報話務，如有改善意見或不滿意事項，可請詳細告知，當局定予切實辦理。</p>
<p>（七）測騐函　電信總局印有電信測騐函，直接寄發各處收發電報電話之商號公司，各界人士收到此項測騐函後，可請詳實塡復，並將不滿意之意見，盡量發表，俾使電局明悉情形，設法改善</p>
<p>（八）電話傳收電報　各界如有電報發寄，可由電話報告電信局抄下發出。若來報亦欲由電話傳送，可請告知電信局照辦。關於利用電話傳收電報，請預先與電信局接洽，以期順利。</p>
<p>（九）交際電報　交際電報專備各界婚喪喜慶時應用，辦法新穎，報價便宜，且可附贈禮券。</p>
<p>（十）夜間報話减價優待　電信總局爲减少用戶負擔起見，電報方面於七月一日起開放夜信電報，每字祗收五百元，電話方面開放夜間减價長途電話，按照日間尋常呌號通話價目七折計算。</p>
<p>以上係擇要列舉電信新辦法，敬請各界隨時儘量利用，其他便利辦法尚多，可請向各地電信局詢問接洽。</p>
<h3>業務漫談</h3>
<p>— 葉昌偉</p>
<p>福州路七十號是上海電信局的總營業處，也是上海的示範營業處。華是在電信局工作，楊李是他的同學，閒談裏以營業處爲開端，對近日電信的改進，來了一個簡括的介紹。</p>
<p>楊：華兄！你是在電信局裏辦公的，你能說一些爲什麼打起電報來這樣擠的緣故嗎？</p>
<p>華：哦！這件事說來話長，講起擁擠的緣故，它的起因還在於發報人自身。</p>
<p>李：恕我揷嘴，營業處的擁擠，是起因於你們營業員人手不多和辦事不快，怎麼倒說起因於發報人呢？</p>
<p>華：嗯，人手不多和辦事不快也是原因之一，但是你可知道祗於四馬路是每天都排着一字長蛇陣，別的分營業處像愚園路，思南路，都是門可羅雀，稀人問津。發報人往往有一個成見，那就是「打電報，四馬路」，有報就往四馬路送，不好好的利用分營業處，因此造成總營業處的擁擠現象。</p>
<p>楊：哦！是這個綠故，那麼，還有其他的原因嗎？</p>
<p>華：還有，就是有些不常發電報的人對於電信方面的常識欠缺，一張發電紙要寫上幾遍，排隊也排上幾次，這樣不但浪費了自己的時間，同時還躭擱了別人的時間，這也是造成擁擠的原因。</p>
<p>李：我又要揷嘴了，民衆電信常識的欠缺，這的確是事實，但是灌輸電信智識，却是你們電信局應負的責任啊！</p>
<p>華：是的，關於這件事情，我們已着手辦理。第一，我們在總營業處設一服務台，專門替發報人解決困難。譬如像代寫發電紙，解釋電報各項疑問等。第二，我們印刷小型發電格式，發電人須知等分送發報人。第三，我們按月借申新兩報刋行電信特到，專門刋載電信常議，和有關電信方面的文章。這樣，我們自己可以减少不必要的麻煩，同時可以使發報人得到不少的便利。</p>
<p>楊：這倒是很好的措置，我又要請問一下了，假如我們外界有什麼疑問和新的建議的話，你們是不是歡迎？</p>
<p>華：謝謝都來不及，怎麼會不歡迎，假如對電信有不明瞭的地方，或其他寳貴的建議，請書面郵寄福州路七十號上海電信局業務稽查室，可能在每星期六申報社會服務欄的「電信問答」裏披露。</p>
<p>楊：好的。</p>
<p>李：好的，時間不早了，我們下次再談吧，再見。</p>
<p>華：再見，有空請常指敎。</p>
<h3>電花</h3>
<p>七月一日起國營事業將普遍漲價的消息在本市報紙上透露以後六月三十那天電報和長途電話業務特別擁擠這天値班的營業員報務員話務負和其他有關的人員都顯得加倍的忙碌眞是汗流浹背辛苦異常。</p>
<p>這次電報電話漲價的動機是因爲電信財政虧負過鉅不得不藉此以彌補，因了過去電報電話價格的過于低小，所以這次的增加四倍，見得有些突兀，甚至有人認爲太高，其實照成本來計算還是不够補償的。</p>
<p>漲價後的電報電話業務還是擁擠得很並不减少。</p>
<p>報話費漲價以後，電信最高當局爲减輕民衆負担起見，特創造兩種新業務，一種呌夜信電報，是利用夜間報務較問時，爲大衆服務，每字只收五百元。另一種呌夜間减價長途電話，是爲一般日間沒有功夫或者來不及掛長途電話的用戶着想而設，其收費照日間尋常呌號通話價目七折計算，通話時間，自每日下午十一時起至次日上午七時爲止，以上兩種，都是新興的平民化電信業務。</p>
<p>七月一日，本局舉行中美恢復通話儀式，到有吳市長，市長夫人，郁局長，宗副管理工程師，市府交際科張科長，上海電話公司代表和中外各報社記者等三十餘人，盛况空前，全部通話語詞並以最新式之鋼絲錄音器錄下，以留記念。</p>
<p>爲增加傳遞速率起見，本局總營業處與各分營業處間，正添裝電傳打字機，現在北站分營業處，已先裝妥應用，成績極佳。本局總營業處，新添長沙發椅五只，專供發報人休息之用，並設服務台，專司解答電信疑問，發報人咸稱便利。</p>
<p>本局第一輛行動電局已經裝配完成，不久即將行駛全市。</p>
<p>七月四日本局放映業務革新電影及天字第一號影片，招待全局同人和眷屬親友。</p>

<h3>電信常識講話（一）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>前言　在戰前，凡辦理電信事業的機關，根據所辦業務的性質，分別稱做「電報局」和「電話局」，近年交通部當局爲事權集中和節省人力物力起見，將各種電信業務合併由「電信局」辦理。所謂電信，係包括有綫電報和電話，無綫電報和電話，以及電相等等，所以，「電信」兩字的涵義很廣，而「電報」祗是「電信」的一種，一般發電人仍舊因襲習慣，把電信局稱做電報局，這是應該糾正的。</p>
<p>本篇所講，耶包括上述各種電信業務，幷以一般顧客所必須瞭解的電信常識爲講述範圍，對於怎樣以最小的代價利用電信而能獲得最大的效果一點，尤其着重。</p>
<p>上篇　電報　第一講電報是什麽東西？</p>
<p>在沒有講到正題以前，讓我先講兩個非常有趣的故事：記得當北伐以前齊盧兩軍在江浙兩省發生內戰的那一年，那時候作者年紀還小，跟隨家長到鄉下去避難，鄉下親戚人家的一位老婆婆拿了一張明信片要我代她寫信。她把明信片呌做「人參片」，她並且告訴我，「人參片」祗要化一分半錢，比寄裝在封套裏的信要便宜一半，而且不用另外化錢去買信壳和信箋，根據她過去的經騐，明信片幷不比信慢到，所以她願意用明信片。另一個故事也是發生在我童年的時候，當時我居住在沿滬寧綫的某一個並不太小的城市裏有一次，一位同居突然收到了從天津打來的一張電報——這還是他生平第一次看到的一張電報——，當時電局對於華文明語電文，並不代爲譯好，所以，他一收到那張電報，立刻就手忙脚亂起來，同時又非常着念，因爲依據他曾經聽到的傳說，打電報一定是爲了某人病故或某人病危那一類事件，在沒有把這些曲曲灣灣的洋碼字譯出以前，他總以爲有什麼不祥的遭遇會降臨到他家的頭上，直等到到書局裏去覓到了一本電碼新編，把它逐字譯出之後，纔知是他家一位遠赴關外經商已經很久失去聯絡的女婿，新從關外還到天津，而且另外給他匯了一筆款子的喜訊。從上面這兩件故事裏，可見郵信的常識已經很普遍地爲公衆所接受，而公衆對於電信的認識，却很淺薄。</p>
<p>那麼電報究竟是什麽東西呢？用最最通俗的譬喩，我們可以說，電報是一封用電來傳送的信，雖然電文裏所抄錄的字蹟，並不像從郵政局送到的信件那般全是寫信人的親筆，但這種缺陷，現在已經有「雷相」來補救了。</p>
<p>郵信與電報的最大不同之點，是在傳滬的技術上的差別，前者是用飛機，車輛，輪船等等交通工具或人力馱運等等方法來傳達，而後者却利用電線（有線電）和電波（無線電）由於上面所說的差別，所以，在計算費用的方法上，郵件係根據重量，而電報却根據時間做標準。拍發電報所佔的時間和電文的長度成正比，所以，計算電報的價目的方法，是用字數來做單位的。</p>
<p>如果從郵信和電報的結構來看，兩者也很類似，試爲比較如下：</p>
<p>（電報的結構）　（郵信的結構）</p>
<p>一，電報報頭　等於　信封上的郵戳</p>
<p>二，納費業務標識等於貼在信封右上角的籤條</p>
<p>三，收報人名稱住址等於寫在信上的收件人名稱住址</p>
<p>四，電文　等於　寫在信箋上的文字</p>
<p>五發報人署名等於發信人署名（待續）</p>

<h3>四九自述</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>美國有一位研究「老年學』的貝介明博士，對於人類的壽命，曾提出一個新穎的意見：「年輕的人，他的生理組織，不一定年輕，年老的，米必衰退，醫如有些遠年的古樹，愈古愈健旺，枝葉茂密，根幹結實，絕不因爲年輪的增加而限止生命力的發展；所以，有些年滿六十五歲的人，依舊精神勃發，生趣盎然，如旭日之方興未艾，正相反，許多年輕的人，倒好像老氣橫秋，已屆入基之年了。』</p>
<p>我被他的高見所啓示，頗能在苦難的歲月中，自得其樂；決不因爲年齡的步步高昇，灰心喪志，嗒然氣餒。孤獨時，則臥遊山水；參加熱閙的塲合時，雖也高興湊湊熱閙，但還是確保客觀的態度，默賞世象。我愛抽煆而無烟癮，愛喝酒而無酒癖；愛看女人，絕無野心。富貴如可求，雖執鞭之士，吾亦爲之，如不可求，從吾所好·又因爲「寡人無疾』，不好貨，不好色，也不想在地面上興風作浪，翻雲覆雨，以萬物爲芻狗，成全自己的霸圖；更不作痴念，鷄鳴而起，孳孳爲利，把法幣換美鈔，美鈔變黃金，預備在停止呼吸的時候，帶到棺材裏去殉葬。所以我的嗜好雖然複雜，實際上異常簡單，具體言之，我歡喜在熟知的範圍內，常常記掛我所絕對找不到壤處的人們；可是，我並不希望他們常常記掛我。我歡喜把想到的接觸到的形形色色，寫在紙上，寄交能支配一個副刋或雜誌的朋友們，可以發表，則發表之，倘有所未便，就請他們隨手拉在字紙簍裏。至於發表之後，能不能獲得讀者的共鳴，會不會觸到某一階層的逆鱗，發生不偷快的反響；是否也算是「不朽』的傑作；那就管不了這許多了。藐予小子，何敢以寫文章爲「三不朽』之一，說實話，不過是雜七搭八的外感內邪，攪得頭昏腦脹時，偶爾發洩一陣子，减輕靈魂的負擔而已！我之愛好雕蟲，又何敢頡頏當代的民主人士，身雖在野，而心寄鉍闕，常常發宣言，打通電，捫蝨談天下事！說是等於吃一帖瀉藥，把積滯的渣滓，瀉瀉淸楚，免得在肚子裏作祟，損害自己的健康，倒是千眞萬確的。我的朋友們奇怪我終日伏案，手不停筆，而從不病倒，請神永遠是那麽充沛，年近五十，找不到一根白髪，不知道我果操何術以致之。殊不知我能想到什麽，就寫出什麼，被我運用了三十多年的一套方塊字，控制在筆尖上，我可以任意奴役，那一個暴君魔王的奴役他們的人民，有我奴役這一套方塊字的痛快和澈底，我之樂此不疲，在其中實含有衛生之道也！</p>
<p>人是可以長壽的，假使不自作孽，而都能自我陶醉，懂得衛生之道的話。同時，要希望社會有進步，國家有前途，我更希望，月常圓，人長壽。因爲長壽的人，閱歷深，經騐多，心平氣和，不至於像年靑的小伙子，動輒怒髪冲冠，打架相罵，敗事有餘，成事不足。俗話說：『嘴上無毛，做事不牢，』就是這個意思。現代比較進步的國家，舉凡大學裏的敎授，各部會的負責者，尤其是「出將入相』的大人物，那一個不是有　顋顋，腦子裏裝滿了經騐和學問，他們自己就是一部豐富的歷史。中國則不然，即以大學敎授而論，看上去都是年輕的小伙子，在外國的白鬍子老敎授的眼光　，定要驚爲奇　的。然這也難怪，中國人的平均年齡祗有三十歲啊！可憐的同胞們，吃　了苦頭，遭盡了磨難，碰　丁　，而自己又看不破紅　，直到經騐和學問將要成熟的時候，雖然歲數並不高，但已屆入墓之年了。此刻美國人對於長壽學的研究，非常認眞，使一般做事的老年人，延長退休的時間，盡可能地增高服務的效率，實在是最經濟最有效的辦法。像中國人的未老先衰，把滿腹的經綸，伴隨病態的身體，提早葬送在墓裏，眞是無法補償的浪費！</p>
<p>地球上的一年，祇有三百六十天，一晝夜僅是二十四小時，如果根據月球上的一晝夜，等於地球上四個星期的時間來計算，我還長四五歲的小孩子呢！而在這短短的時間內，除去睡眠，酬應，開會，簽到，簽退，受訓，聽講……的種種不急之務外，埋頭工作的時間，不過佔有極短的一剎那，就算有一點兒成績，眞是微乎其微。因此，我今年雖已開始度四十九歲，由於我的工作都要從頭做起，絕不能自滿過去，我的工作年齡，還是非常幼　的！感謝重慶的朋友們，也要模仿中外大作家的韻事，在我今年的生日，熱鬧一次，從沒有片刻的休息，寫下了超越千餘萬字的「抗戰八股』呢！這一片由衷的悃忱，使我感動得淌下漸愧的酸淚，這些敝帶自珍的「遼東豕」，是沒有藝術的生命的，都跟隨敵僞的死亡，一同消滅了，有什麼值得慰勞的價值呵！我也同樣抱着由衷的悃忱，謝絕了朋友們的美意。但我頗想在『四九自述」的標題下，略抒我的懷思，從今以後，我但朮在自己願意做的工作上，施用我剩餘的時間。除了必不可少的睡眠時間外，我不打算再在開會，酬應，逢塲作戲上，浪費我寶貴的光陰了！自己要寫下的東西，實在太多，後面雖還有一大段時間，畢竟是有限的，我自覺無何成就之可言，我更要珍惜；譬如說，在任何種會議席上，缺少了像我這樣一位跑龍套的角色。並無碍於開會的熱鬧，然在我實受惠無窮呢！</p>
<h3>讀「臨川夢」</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>蔣士　爲湯顯祖寫的一部「臨川夢」，可當湯顯祖的傳狀讀，是九種曲中最好的一部曲子。記得有一位西洋文學家說過：「眞正作家的本身就是一首好詩。」湯臨川的一首好詩，被蔣士銓如實地而又藝術地寫了出來。從來替自己所欽佩的人作傳狀文的，沒有比這部渤臨川傳寫得更別緻更可愛的了。梁任公常歎中國沒有長長千萬言的大傳，像外國的傳記文學一樣。不知「臨川夢」正是一部中國文人最好傳記的代表作。它比鮑斯威爾所作的約翰生傳更高明，更有藝術趣味，雖然它所用的文體是一稱有韵的戲曲，而並非是用散文寫的。（我所讀的是紅雪樓藏板清容外集乾隆年間大字本刻本。）</p>
<p>湯臨川，名顯　，字義仍，一字若士，江西臨川人。明世宗嘉靖二十九年庚戌（一五五〇）生，明神宗萬曆四十五年丁已（一六一七）卒。生性傲慢，不慕權貴。萬曆五年，正是張居正做宰相聲勢煊赫的時候，張要抬舉自己的兒子，高中狀元，又恐天下人議笑他的兒子沒有眞才，於是硬派當時第一流名士湯顯祖和沈懋學做他兒子的陪襯，一做榜眼，一做探花，結果，沈懋學是去了，　祖却一口謝絕，堅不肯往，他是羞於爲別人做陪嫁的丫頭的。直等權相張居正死了，他才出頭點進士。在南京太常博士任上，他上疏論効政府信用私人，陰扼台　，數千言洋洋大文，十分亢直，因此被貶謫爲徐聞縣典史，到任後即立貴生書院講學，改移士習，後爲遂昌知縣。</p>
<p>他生平痛恨假名士陳繼儒（眉公），力詆無懼，終受其暗室之害，致不能爲世所用，窮愁　書，以了餘生。最有名的「　　堂四夢」－牡丹亭（還魂記），紫釵記，南柯記，邯鄲　等，成爲不朽的傑作。</p>
<h3>仕女</h3>
<p>— 許徵白</p>
<p>明史本傳上說他…「……所居玉茗堂，文史狼藉，鷄　豕圈，雜杳庭戶，蕭閒詠歌，俯仰自得，胸中塊壘，發爲詞曲，所著四夢，雖留連風懷，感激物態，要于洗蕩清塵，銷歸烏有，作達觀空，亦可悲矣。……」</p>
<p>蔣士銓根據了這一點本事，做成一部二十齣的戲曲—臨川夢—，其目錄是：拒弋，隱奸，諧夢，想夢，改夢，星變，抗疏，哱變，送尉，殉夢，宦成，　跛，續夢，雙噬，寄曲，訪夢，集夢，花慶，說夢，了夢，分上下二卷。</p>
<p>劇中寫婁江女子兪二姑爲讀「牡丹亭」着了迷，竟至爲情而死，魂訪臨川，中間穿揷當時時事，（如哱承恩之叛變，梅國楨之平賊。）和臨川在徐聞的敎績，在遂昌的政績等，終塲是還魂記紫釵記邯鄲夢南柯夢中人物，齊集玉茗堂，各說各的夢，最後說夢了夢二齣，極寫臨川曲中的精義。</p>
<p>了夢一齣的尾聲道：『堂前玉茗今枯槁，把四夢都從一夢銷，可歎這夢境難承夢難了。」</p>
<p>「還魂記」中的鬼，（本是杜麗娘而由兪二姑代之出場。）紫釵記中的俠，（由霍郡主出塲）邯鄲夢中的仙，（由盧公出塲）南柯夢中的佛，（由淳于郎出塲）這本是回夢中的含義，在一般人的看法，應該要請判官（還魂記中眞正的鬼），黃衫客（紫釵記中眞正的俠，呂翁（邯鄆夢中眞正的仙），契玄（南柯記中眞正的佛），在塲面上出現。可是鬼俠仙佛，只算得是曲本中的主人，不是作者意中的主人，杜霍盧淳爲塲中的傀儡，判官黃衫客等乃是提　綫索的；前四人爲夢中之人，後四人乃夢外之人。旣然以鬼俠仙佛爲曲意，那主觀的主人即屬于判官黃衫客等，而杜女霍郡主等，只是客觀的主人而已。臨川的天才及其思想所以能超出尋常傳奇家的窠臼，須於此等處精細以求之。</p>
<p>士銓和顯祖，隔世同心，正因爲他們的才同，而境亦不甚差異。「紅樓夢」史湘雲對菊有句云：「數去更無君傲世，看來誰有我知音。」正可以移作蔣士銓贈湯顯祖之用。古代文人如馮敬通「自序」之後。有劉孝標的「自序」，孝標「自序」之後，又有汪中的「自序」，什麼一三同四異』，早已爲文學研究者所爭稱，士銓在臨川夢中借兪三姑的口吻說：「……也只爲　透情懷萬千條，料得定文章到此知音少；因此上寒窗兩費蘭膏，箋出你才人痛哭才人笑！」不是明明白白地自許爲臨川知音嗎？馮小青讀牡丹亭一絕云：「冷雨敲窗不可聽，挑燈閒看牡丹亭，人間也有痴於我，豈獨傷心是小青！』這位小靑和婁江兪二姑也許同樣都是文人造出的心靈上知音的代表人吧。</p>
<p>士銓「臨川夢」「自序」有云：「獨惜婁江女子，爲公而死，其識力過於當時執政遠矣。』不必有此人，不必無此事，他原是說夢以諷世，爲文章知己而發的感慨啊。</p>
<p>他又有自題「臨川夢」一律云：</p>
<p>「腐儒談理俗難醫，下士言情格苦　；</p>
<p>苟合皆無持正想，流連爭賞誨淫詞。</p>
<p>人間世佈珊瑚網，造化兒牽傀儡絲；</p>
<p>脫展榮枯生死外，老夫叉手看多時。」</p>
<p>讀此律句，更可以明瞭士銓作「臨川夢」的眞正宗旨所在，而士銓對于文藝創作的見解和思想也自己和盤托出了。</p>
<p>按：蔣士銓，鉛山人，字心餘，亦字　生，生於淸雍正三年（一七二五）卒於乾隆五十一年（一七八六），著有「忠雅堂詩集」，以叙事見稱，筆調秀麗，凄鬱動人。所撰「紅雪樓九種曲」，尤膾炙人口。再湯顯祖據鄭振鐸「文學大綱」作卒於一六二年，即明萬曆三十九年也，未知孰是。（編者）</p>

<h3>市美術館籌備處　近百年畫展序</h3>
<p>— 附凡例</p>
<p>或曰：畫苑之士侈言唐宋，而美術館獨以近百年倡，豈其所見者退耶？予曰唯唯否否！夫詩至杜甫亦至聖矣，而甫之言曰：「王楊　駱當時體，不薄今人愛古人」；王楊盧駱之去杜甫不及百年，體之衰，若決江河而日下也。杜甫憂之而欲起之，毅然以詩道之禹禮自任；然彼不高唱漢魏，而獨以王楊　駱之不薄爲倡，何也？能近取　，取人人之所習知而習見者，以爲研究矯正之鵠；若遠行然，必登高自卑，乃得登泰山而覽天下；若未陟徂徠，先攀岱頂，身無羽翼而欲憑距躍以超絕頂，其不斷腕絕脛，隕身溝　者，吾不信焉！</p>
<p>於畫亦何獨不然？今人侈言唐畫，唐以王維爲南宗，自宋以來能言王維眞蹟者幾何人，以李思訓爲北宗，自宋以後能言李思訓者幾何人？降及五代荊關董巨之跡，宜若可以見矣，然荊關眞跡之鮮，一如王李，董巨較多，可舉而數者，四海之大不足十幅；眞僞之莫定，歷代著錄聚訟，尚如議禮；是侈言唐　者，何異日者扣燭而捫槃，以此爲日，何怪舉室之惛惛也！</p>
<p>宋畫盛於太平興國以後，迄今適千年，畫士之盛，加倍於唐，然米海嶽已作無李論，（李營邱爲開實進士，去米芾約一百三十餘年，）降及米蘇，亦復難得。自淸故宮開放，而南宋以來名畫劇跡，始稍稍見於人間，然非卓識之士，博覽羣書者，亦不足以審其出處，定其眞僞。故欲觀唐宋之眞跡，何異登泰山絕頂，而有元一代則泰山之天門也。其雲物變化，木石莽　之象、雖在徂徠，亦易見之，則明初以至乾嘉，其間四百年，又泰山之祖徠也。而嘉道以還，近一百年，乃如北邙篙里，雖附泰山而荒蕪凡穢，若不可接。然而近郭十星，村氓牧兒，無不知有北邙篙里，夕遊朝處，一瀾一石，無不耳熱能詳；顧泰岱者能越萬里北邙一步，而自謂可至者乎？是近百年之畫史，有待吾輩借徑以登陟乎唐宋，是不待智者而後知矣！</p>
<p>且不特此也，唐宋有國各數百年，以畫名家，得劇迹可　者，各不足數十人；元有國八十年，名家劇迹可舉而數者，不過數十人；明有國二百年，可舉而數者，不過百餘人；淸有國三百年，可舉而數者亦不過二百人。自咸同以至民國僅百年，而可舉其姓名，見其作品自附於名家之林者，何止三百人？何昔之名家尠而精，今之夥而雜也？無他，時代近則易知，遠則易滅也。</p>
<p>且不特此也，荊關董巨之並稱其間，相距且百年，元四家流，其間亦且百年，降及沈文唐仇，而仇沈之間，相距亦且百年，四王吳惲並稱，惲南田之於烟客！亦且少長數十年，當於其間，畫家之衆，茂如春草，非僅以荊·關·董·巨·黃·王·倪·吳·四·王·吳·惲·傳也。蓋時代之淘汰爲之也。時代如篩，畫家如沙、披沙揀金，而後百年之間，存此數人而已。自咸豐以至今日又百年矣，畫家之盛，茂如春草，披沙揀金，其間可存者幾何人？能接四王吳惲之席，以梯階於唐宋元明者幾何人。則我　　也。不知其近而侈　遠，吾未知其可也。此美術館乃有近百年畫展之發起，而屬序於予，幷爲之凡例如左：</p>
<p>一，自　監至民國三十六年，其間僅九十七年。劉彥冲，費曉樓皆歿於道光末年，故編年，實起於巡光二十八年，論代則斷自咸豐元年，以淸眉目·</p>
<p>二，百年以來，名家　如烟海，鐵網珊瑚，難免掛一漏萬，豈通都僻邑，何處無賢？同人等見聞　淺，所失尤多，今以本展爲上海市美術館　備處所發起，故以各地名家曾經流寓上海者爲經，其他各地名家，祇得從簡。</p>
<p>三，本展限於會塲，陳列點至多不過三百幅，其編列目錄，以便於　覽起見，各從姓氏筆劃爲序，另列小傳以備　檢。</p>
<p>四，本展以供大衆研究，及批評爲目的，故於陳列出品，以能每一作者均有代表作品爲原則。其作品繁富，收藏易得，若　陸任吳諸家，反而從簡，尚</p>
<p>五，本展出品，除由負責人專心徵集外，仍望藏家多多供給，尤以冷名精品不可多得之品，爲陳列希望，倘荷借陳，請向陝西南路一三九號上海市立美術館籌備處索取出品簡章，及表格。</p>
<p>六，出品以裝裱軸幅爲原則，手卷尺頁，以陳列關係，祇能儘量减少。</p>
<p>七，本展定名爲「近百年書畫展」，但百年以來書家之多，美不勝收，故本展以「書家之畫」「畫家之書」爲原則，其他書家，祗得割愛。</p>
<p>八，本展儘量採取觀衆批評，如荷投寄文字，請寄本籌備處以便擇尤選刋，彙成專集。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血342</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>傍晚黃昏的時候，出外探探的四個人，頭一頭回來的是劉氏，半小時後，杜二和劉五也前後一步向棧；都表現着一稱疲倦帶興奮的姿態。三個人的報吿，雖說各有差異，但大部分無關宏旨；只有兩點，可以注意：（一）日軍行動總司令部和別動隊（特工及便衣隊）指揮總站，都不在昌平城內。確定地點雖不淸楚，但可斷定在沙河與昌平西邊兩綫交叉的一個小鎭上。這是軍事秘密，當然一時呌化們無從探到。（二）證實倭寇揀定第二犬，即八月八日，發動　口攻勢。</p>
<p>關於當地人民受驚擾，我也無法說明；總之，可以「　」，「痛」，二字概括一切。人民動態，倒是有一特點：別看這個小小地方，文化水準低到零度以下，本地工人，却敢說沒有一個漢奸。相反地，全部的人，不分男女老少，眞能做到了「抗日」兩個字：可能走的，早走了；走不動的，絕對不受外來漢奸的利誘，和日本浪人的威脅。被拘服役的壯丁，不打不肯動手，就是動手，也不肯賣力；被捉的婦女，始終哭啼抗拒。在鐵蹄刺刀威逼之下，道些沒受訓練，無人組織的老百姓，能如此消極抵抗，也眞不容易。</p>
<p>上燈以後，「〇四」仍舊不見踪影；雖說知道他不會出亂子，然而我始終替他担着心事；因他辦事，有些大胆的作風。十點種與w君再度通話之後，「〇四」仍舊足音杳然。直到夜午十二點，我正端整了電訊機，預備與潘陽東京接綫的當口，忽然聽見窗外一個　　的聲音，　低了嗓子，同輪值　備的劉五交換隱語。緊接，看見一個晃蕩蕩高大個子的人影，進了套屋，後面還有一個身量較小的跟着走進。室內沒有燈火，比外面較暗；我在裏間，比較更暗，所以還看得出外面的動靜。</p>
<p>「秘書長」。這大傻瓜的聲音裏、雖表示了沉着恭謹，却藏不住一團高興的音調。</p>
<p>「進來」。我招呼着，同時發出去的密碼呼號，也待了回音。（三四二）</p>
<p>絮語</p>
<h3>戲劇與現實</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>「假鳳虛　」影片內容，因牽涉理髮師，試映時遭理髮師的阻撓，致臨時中止放映。</p>
<p>假如我們不健忘的話，上海電影院·劇院，爲着同樣情形而挨打的，也已經不是第一次。</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，北四川路上海大戲院，不單戲院被搗毀，甚至連影片都被燒燬的。</p>
<p>本來戲劇與電影不能與現實脫節，它所反映的，正是人生社會中的一部分，它所描寫的人物，也正是社會中活生生的典型的人物；戈果里的「欽差大臣」，至今尚在廣東梅縣扮演；「蛻變」中醫院院畏的營私舞弊，現在還是到處可見；「桃花　」中的侯朝宗，今天還不是　目鮮明？</p>
<p>因此，對於電影戲劇之反映現實，頭腦冷靜的人，似乎不應該提出苛求，以爲這是碰痛了誰，這是諷刺了誰！</p>
<p>問題的中心，如若戲劇，電影的內容，歪曲了事實，故意造謠中傷，這是應該提出抗議的。</p>
<p>比如美國片中，常常有侮　華人的塲面與誤解中國風俗習慣的地方，我們不單應提出抗議，而且應該確宣指明錯誤的所在。</p>
<p>以如此觀點去看電影戲劇，或許不致造成許多不必要的糾紛。</p>

<h3>飛盤的「謎底」</h3>
<p>— 郁影</p>
<p>編者按：本刋昨日刋載「飛盤」的眞相；今再揭載郁影先生的飛盤的「謎底」，使讀者更能明了在美國閙得滿城風雨的「飛盤」，究竟是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>美國人動軐歡喜誇張原子彈的威力，似乎都患了原子在，這原因，一方面自然足以顯示美國人的朝氣蓬勃，財富雄厚，樂于研究新事物；一方面也爲了第二次大戰才結束，大家懍然千戰爭的慘酷，就不得不用更慘酷的幻想來麻醉自己了。</p>
<p>對于最近美國朝野爲「飛盤之謎」而大忙特忙，我們亦可作如是觀。</p>
<p>所謂「飛盤」，經過無數人的觀察，又經過好多隻飛機的追逐，最後才證明它只是一種高空氣候測量器之一，結構脆簿，殆如紙　，而其原料顯係某種錫箔，據德克薩斯州第八航空隊司令雷梅少將說：「看來並無奇特之處」。</p>
<p>于是，以前所盛傳的推測，諸如（一）外國設計之秘密細菌武器呀，（二）新式陸軍火箭呀，（三）空間船呀……之類的傳說，也都變成了「自我諷刺」式的笑話了。</p>
<p>幾隻錫箔製的「飛盤」，使美國朝野興奮了好多天，大家都有點疑神疑鬼，慄慄自危，其力量也正太偉大了，然而拆穿來設，這又何嘗是「飛盤」的力量，正因爲戰爭的破壞力太大，而原子彈還在美國人的手裏，以己度人，不免日日躭心別的國家會發明出一些旁門左道的玩意兒，這才出現了「飛盤」，事實上這還只是開頭呢。在「飛盤」以前，美國沿海岸不是已有過「火箭」之類的傳說了麼？</p>
<p>所以，要査究「飛盤」的眞正謎底，單是研究它的結構，分析它的內蘊，是不够的，要緊的是必須弄淸楚，何以今日大多數美國人對「飛盤」會如此狂熱？一切的附會，謠言，猜忌，誇張，强調，其實只源于一個原因：戰後盟國間的不洽調有以致之。而「飛盤」的眞正謎底，也就在此。</p>
<h3>應天長</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>飛盤</p>
<p>「飛盤」作怪爭傳報，那個存心開玩笑？星般耀，謎般奧；三十三州慌不了！</p>
<p>這旁門左道，許把「封神」偷盜？古籍原多法寶，問「先知」必曉！</p>
<h3>說鼓中三老</h3>
<p>— 鼓手</p>
<p>末了再說說劉寶全。</p>
<p>寶全唱的是京韵大鼔，可以說是有口皆碑。寶全第一次來上海，是在新世界，丙午後，在北平雖也聽過，伊尚未享大名，辛亥壬子間，在天津，方有人大加贊美，暇時亦與姪輩往總，新世界第一日，即與山荊同往，唱的是李逵奪魚，此齣本是寶全拿手，某大文豪說是項羽本紀，士別三日，尚當刮目相看，况別已數年耶，連聽十五日，認爲伊之行腔使調，實在與衆不同。其中自以兩本戰長沙，兩本寗武關爲最出色，實全的槍刀架子本來率關周的忠勇，雖同是雄武氣概，壯穆生平，總帶幾分驕氣。周氏一門忠烈，自老母至義僕，各有各的神氣，各有各的心思，各有各的口吻，寶全的唱法，英雄氣短，兒女情長，可算是體貼入微，好像施耐庵寫水滸人物，有種種不同筆法。長沙一戰，桃　兄弟，朝氣方盛，關公雖　，義釋漢升，一片愛才之心，寶全也唱得惟妙惟肖。</p>
<p>寶全來滬三次。第二次，唱大西廂，他人唱此，雖詞句宛全相同，却不及寶全遠甚。第一中氣厚，第二口勁足，第三音吐淸亮，第四描摹宛曲開首如畫一嬌嫩女郎，漸次兩女問答，如好鳥弄晴，口氣由緩而急，有如急雨打芭蕉，愈快愈淸楚。又如白香山詩所說，大珠小珠落玉盤，盤圓珠走，一氣呵成，沒有一字留滯。紅娘入西廂，方急脈受，緩諧謔間作，他人聽之，方以爲可以鬆一口氣，不知正是緊要關頭，詞句愈詼諧，神氣愈緊張，小小紅娘，呼之欲出，唱至此，神乎技矣。不過鼓王致詞，文理欠亨，與劍塵之深知文藝，成反比例，可算是大醇小疵。（下）</p>
<h3>火在那裏</h3>
<p>— 禾生</p>
<p>某人有　，非常懶惰，每日他出去辦公前，必需規目弄平飯，因此他頗思有一個矯正她的機會。一天，他到了辦公室以後，忽然想起忘帶了一件重要的公文，便匆匆趕回家中，那時已日上三竿，而他妻子却仍然高臥未起，他便在樓下高聲呌喊：「火！火！」他妻子在睡夢中　　過來，急忙披衣下床，從樓上如飛般奔下，問他丈夫：「火在那夷？火在那裏？」他丈夫悠然答道：「除了吾家，別人　裏都有呢！」</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐</p>
<p>集中營成爲日僑安</p>
<p>在抗戰初期，美藉日僑依然行動　　　　　束，可是道班日本人吃美國人的飯，却替東洋人　　　　　　了間諜網，準備日海軍在美登陸時來一　　　　　　　　沒法，才把他們關進集中營，這一來便宜了　　中國人，　僑所經營的事業，飯店，農塲之類，都廉價讓給中國人　　國人特地爲日僑築造新式僑民邨，不但住宿免費，連伙食也不費分文，還有配給牛奶可吃，白吃白住外，由美政府給與零用錢，美國政府不啻做了日僑的乾爸爸，美國人可算是認賊作「子」了。</p>
<p>日僑雖被圈入集中營，行動是相當自由的，規定每星期可以進城二次，有特別事宜，隨時可以吿假外出、在慶特羅Chandler郊外有一個日僑集中營，我每次進城，公共汽車上一定碰到半車日本女孩子，她們雖係美國生長，却仍具有東方人的風趣，在汽宣中高談關論，笑聲盈耳，日本女人一向是好笑的，集中營的生活一定是頗爲不惡的，所以笑得那麼起勁。美國小孩看見了日本人，手指着喊道Japs,Japs日本人不承認自己是Japs是Japanese，猶之中國不承認是Chink而是Chinese，因爲廣東人特別矮小，我錯把同學關潔貞女士當作日本人。</p>
<p>日僑分有親美與親日兩大派，兩派在集中營常械鬥，政府允許親美派從軍建功贖罪，在意大利作戰的日僑　下不朽功勳，美籍日軍連指揮官在內完全是日本人。日本未　服前，大部日僑都已恢復自由，仍回舊業，從事耕植。（十八）</p>
<h3>美國國務院　實行國策劃外交的總樞紐</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>華府維幾尼亞大道及二十一號街上的新建大厦，是美國外交的總樞紐——國務院所在地。國務院成立於一七八九年，由那時八個職員的編制，擴充到現在有近八千的部內職員，和一萬一千餘駐外的使领和職員。經費預算也擴至一萬七千八百萬美金了。因爲過去曾統辦內外行政，所以就呌做國務院，現在雖另設內政部，但仍兼顧關於國　，公布法令等等事務。在各部間居首席地位。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥總領外交行政。其下有副國務卿羅維特氏、是一個銀行家，曾任過陸軍部空軍常務次長，組織力極強，須負責襄助國務卿辦理關於　訂外交政策招待外賓及監察外交政策之執行，並可代理部務，常隨總統及國務卿進退。另有專任顧問，現爲柯漢氏担任。</p>
<p>助理國務卿有六位：希爾德林少將担任掌管佔領區事務，聞不久將去職；克萊頓掌管國際經濟事務；班登主管公共的文化關係等事務；潘利福掌管行政事務；亞塺爾掌管拉丁美洲各國事務；鄧恩掌管歐亞菲各洲事務。這之下，包括了歐洲，遠東，近東及菲洲，美洲，政務，情報等六司，下轄大英帝國，中國、日本，南亞，近東，中東、東歐等等共廿四個科，</p>
<p>馬歇爾在部內另設立了一個外交政策設計委員會，以陸軍大學外交組副主任耿南氏爲主席，專家五人担任委員，職業外交家薩凡奇祖任機要秘書。耿南是蘇聯問題專家，故可測知今後美國外交的着力點。該處工作是研究並決定外交根本政策及其實施方針，建議於國務鄉。如像參謀總部的參謀處一般，該處工作由副國務卿指導。過去，國務院的任務，只是負責外交行政，代表政府在國際間實行國策而已，現在是在策劃外交的決策了。而且馬歇爾準備將德日境美佔領區管制權，自軍部接收，此種行動一變一百五十八年來國務院之傳統，而直接過問實際之行政。目今更計劃和將執行援助歐洲各國呢！</p>
<p>可注意的是美國總統根據國策，是可以處理外交重大事務和決定外交政策的，此在故羅斯福總統執政時，白宮權力最顯著。政府其他部門、如財政部陸海軍部，以及國際機構中的美國代表團、亦均得執行其職責所規定的外交事務，不過這須和國務院聯絡，受其指導的。</p>
<p>國務院中，遠東司和我國關係最大，該司成立於一九〇八年，司長總理遠東各國如中·日，邊等國外交事務、副司長三人分掌遠東，經濟、外交，處理調査中日外交及遠東外交人才訓練，保僑等等事務。現任司長爲范宣德氏，今年已屆滿在部內服務年限，行將外放。美國重視專家，所以外交人員也注意職業化，近馬　爾在積極整頓外交人事中。</p>

<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>曇花（中）</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>現在，我們應用比較近於科學的方法來記述一下曇花的形態吧。</p>
<p>民國三十一年筆者在永嘉的時候，十一月三日，農學家先進王畝氏會以上一晚開過了的曇花</p>
<p>一朶見貽，這是筆者第一次見到曇花的實物，也是直到現在，還是唯一次的見到雲花的實物。為了便於日後的參考起見，當時會作記載如下：</p>
<p>「花未開及閉合時呈鵝頭形（開過了的花是閉合的）。筒部細長，呈花梗狀，中央彎曲，喉部向上朝。表面草紅色，子房下部微綠。筒部外方疏生短小的麟葉，上端漸密而長，喉部外方有二·三層，共十餘片，長闊而色淡，呈蕚狀。內部為花瓣，白色微綠，共約二十片。態在內方的愈闊而薄，倒卵形，梢端尖，微有尖尾。脈紋址，微呈細紗狀。</p>
<p>「雄蕊多數，有上下二組：下組散生於筒部彎曲處至喉底；上組自喉底駢列於四壁，至口部而離生；上下兩組着生的最短距離爲三·五厘米。花絲嫩白而細—生在腹側的較短，上組生在腹側的向上彎曲。藥淡黃色，直生，朝向腹側，花粉球形。</p>
<p>「子房下位，一室，側膜胎座，含多數倒生胚珠，扁豆形而薄，珠柄細長。花柱細長，嫩白色，中空；頂端分裂成十四條，即為柱頭，有的梢端更分裂為二；頗似海葵或島哦的觸手，長約一·五厘米，嫩黃色。</p>
<p>「全花長三一厘米，花瓣長六·七厘米，闊三—三·五厘米……」</p>
<p>當時爲了觀察便利的緣故，把這朵花對剖爲二半，觀察以後，壓製成臘葉標本，到現在還保存着。</p>
<p>這一日下午，又到王氏府上去，　到　花是　足霸王樹那一類的仙人掌，但莖質較爲堅硬、並不倒掛，高有二尺餘。</p>
<p>仙人掌科植物原產於美洲的熱帶和亞熱帶，像上海這樣天氣，冬季便不能生長，在永嘉十一月裏還能够開花，在上海非在溫室裏受保護不可了。曇花的所以不甚常見，便是這個緣故。還有，因爲在這裏生長不易，所以每枝曇花，並不是每年都能够開花，所謂「五十年開放一次」的傳說，也便是這樣產生的。</p>
<p>曇花究竟是美洲那一處地方的原產，什麽時候傳到東方，什麽時傳入我國，在那一處最先培養，這些，可惜我們尙沒有明白。</p>

<h3>National Army Uses Annihilation Tactics; Situation in Central Shandong Gradually Improves; Jieshou Recovered, Taian Imminent</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] In the Yishan Mountain area between Yishui, Linqu, and Nanma in Shandong Province, the National Army has launched a large-scale annihilation campaign. Approximately 70,000 remnant communist troops are trapped in a heavy encirclement by the National Army. For days, troops have been dispatched to encircle and annihilate them, resulting in fierce fighting. On the morning of the 12th, the National Army routed the 26th and 2nd Columns of the communist forces, successively capturing more than ten strongholds north of Donglidian, including Songshan Wangzhuang, Bada Zhuang, and Woshan Baizilan, annihilating eight regiments of the communist forces. Another mobile force of the National Army is intensifying its encirclement and annihilation of the main force of the 7th and 9th Columns of the communist forces in the area southeast of Nanma, including Nanbei Anle, Dahongyu, and northeast of Yue Zhuang. Furthermore, the communist forces that have been harassing Yixian and Zaozhuang are being surrounded by the National Army and are showing signs of fleeing back to the northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] The new deployment of the National Army in Shandong Province has been completed. Mobile tactics are being used, and troops are being freely deployed according to needs to achieve the goal of annihilating the communist forces. Currently, the National Army in central and southern Shandong is defending positions in Yishui, Jiangyu, Yue Zhuang, Nanma, Donglidian, Tanbu, Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu, and other places, launching attacks on the communist forces from various directions. Although Linqu was abandoned, the recovery of Yishui and Jiangyu still gives the military an absolute advantage. The communist forces have been cut off by the National Army, with six columns fleeing to the area north of Donglidian, Laiwu, and Nanma, and five columns fleeing to the Liangqiu Mountain area.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] On the 13th, fighting in the Yimeng Mountain area remained intense. Communist forces in Yixian and Zaozhuang are retreating north. The National Army, launching a counter-offensive towards Taian, reached south of Jieshou early on the 13th and the outskirts of the city in the afternoon, expecting to recover Taian that night.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The Wang Yaowu corps of the National Army, which came south from Jinan to provide reinforcements, routed the main force of the 10th Column of the communist forces. On the afternoon of the 12th, it continued to capture Jiemu, and by noon on the 13th, it had reached the outskirts of Taian city, engaging in fierce fighting with the 8th Column of the communist forces. Taian is expected to be captured soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The situation in the central Shandong mountain area is gradually improving. Seven columns of communist bandits are being transferred from Donglidian, Nanma, and north of Laiwu to Zibo in recent days, resembling roaming bandits, attempting to probe the outer defenses of Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 13th] 30,000 communist troops fled east from the periphery of Weixian in several routes. 20,000 of the Shandong Liberation Army fled to Da Xiao Fange Zhuang and attacked Jiaoxian. Another 10,000 or so communist troops of unknown designation crossed the Jiao River eastward yesterday. The National Army west of Jiaoxian is prepared to repel them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 13th] After Liu Bocheng's forces in western Shandong captured Dingtao on the 11th, they began on the 12th to deploy their five elite columns, harassing Chengwu, Cao County, and the border area between Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan in three directions. The National Army is intercepting them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 13th] Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Area, and Zhang Xuezhong, commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area, have recently returned to their posts from Xuzhou. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Gu gave instructions to Li and Zhang on clearing out the remaining communist bandits in northern Jiangsu. It is also learned that a part of the elite National Army forces returning to northern Jiangsu from southern Shandong has entered the territory of Ganyu County to eliminate the remaining bandits in the Haishu area, stabilizing the situation in the East Sea.</p>
<h3>Baoding Shortens Martial Law; National Army in Hebei Province to Join Forces in Renqiu; Pingjinbao Triangle Area Can Be Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 10th] The large forces of the National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are sweeping through central Hebei in several directions, making rapid progress. The National Army advancing south from Baoding crossed the Qingshui River yesterday and attacked into the territory of  County, engaging in fierce battles on the outskirts of the city. The eastern route recovered Gaoyang County yesterday afternoon, and the cavalry division is rapidly advancing towards Hejian via a roundabout route. The National Army advancing south from Xiong County recovered the new county seat of Shouxin on the afternoon of the 13th and stationed in Renqiu. The remaining communist forces are retreating towards Hejian and Suning. Furthermore, the 4th Column of the communist forces is currently entrenched in Boye and south of Li County, having fled from Quyang. The 2nd Column moved from Gaoyang to Hejian yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The National Army in Baoding and Shijiazhuang is actively sweeping through the area. The recovery of Xiong County has been confirmed, and Baxian was captured again yesterday, so the Pingjinbao triangle area can be cleared. The troops advancing south from Baoding, after capturing Wangdu Station, were still engaged in fierce fighting with the communist forces in the vicinity on the 13th. The National Army advancing north from Shijiazhuang captured Xin'an Station yesterday after recovering Zhengding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 13th] Military intelligence: The National Army advancing north from Shijiazhuang, after recovering Zhengding County at 4 p.m. on the 10th, continued to advance in three directions. Currently, the central route of the National Army has approached Dong Changshou, and the left and right wings are searching and advancing along the northern bank of the Hutuo River. The Gao Yang armored vehicles met with the troops advancing south from Xiong and Baxian in Renqiu in three routes on the morning of the 13th, and are now pressing towards Hejian, so the Baocang Road can be opened.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Baoding and Yuan were peaceful as ever, no bandit activity reported within twenty Chinese miles and martial law has been delayed from 10pm to 12am.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong and Others Go to Baoding</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Sun Lianzhong hosted a banquet on the 13th for senior generals of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, including Chen Jicheng, Shangguan  Xiang, and Hou Jingru, to study the instructions of Chief of Staff Chen. Sun is scheduled to fly to Baoding on the 14th to arrange military affairs. The Central Military慰勞 (comfort) Delegation, including Lu Zhonglin and others, will also go to Baoding on the 14th to comfort the troops.</p>
<h3>The Tense Situation in Taiyuan Is Now a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received Chu  Chun, commander-in-chief of the First Army Group, and Guo Zongfen, chief of staff of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, at 1 p.m. on the 13th, inquiring about the recent military and political situation in Shanxi Province. Afterwards, Guo told reporters that the tense situation in Taiyuan a month ago is now a thing of the past. The airlift of supplies has boosted morale and popular sentiment, and the National Army has smoothly launched attacks on the periphery of Taiyuan to thwart the communist forces' plan to seize grain before the autumn harvest. Their mission in Nanjing has been completed, and they will return to Taiyuan after negotiating the discounted price of military grain with the Ministry of Food. [Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] Chen Geng led his troops back to southern Shanxi via Yangcheng, where they joined the original bandit forces, totaling eight brigades, and occupied Jicheng, Jiangxian, Quwo, Wenxi, Hejin, and Yishi. They also began attacking Xia County, occupying the bunker positions in Sanlidun and Zhangdongcun, north of the city, on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] The National Army launched attacks on Dingxiang in several directions on the morning of the 8th, capturing the county seat by nightfall. The remaining communist forces fled northeast.</p>
<h3>It Is Reported That Two Islands in the Miaodao Islands Have Soviet Troops Stationed There.</h3>
<p>If true, we will file a negotiation.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The Miaodao Islands in the Bohai Strait have long been a bridge for the communist bandits in Northeast China and Shandong Province. Sailing boats come and go frequently, transporting supplies. In the past, the communist forces used this route to reinforce their troops and transport weapons from Dalian to Shandong, which greatly affected the war in Shandong. Our maritime patrol fleet has long paid attention to this. However, it is reported that both Dazhushan Island and Xiaozhushan Island in the archipelago are stationed with Soviet armed forces, providing a great deal of support to the CCP's maritime connections. A reporter inquired about this matter from diplomatic officials, who said that the government had also heard of this rumor, but had not yet received an official report. If it is true, we will, in order to safeguard the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, file a negotiation. As for any accidental disputes caused by our coastal defense forces in carrying out their missions, our country will not bear any responsibility.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communists Want to Organize a Communist Regime on the Ruins</h3>
<p>Manchester Evening News Commentary</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] The Manchester Evening News today commented on the war in China, saying that since Marshall left China in May, the Soviet Union has undoubtedly been assisting the CCP, just as it did in the past to help the CCP gain a foothold in Northeast China. The CCP's threat has greatly increased in the past six months, and it is believed that the CCP has occupied vast amounts of land in Northeast China. At the same time, the CCP is using Dalian and Lushun (which the Soviet Union still occupies despite the Sino-Soviet Treaty) to continuously transport reinforcements to North China. The newspaper stated that the CCP has recently established a Xinhua News Agency in London, publishing a large number of weekly propaganda materials, which is very important. The Kuomintang's mistakes have been widely publicized, but those who promote the CCP abroad as the only friend of the peasants are either deliberately or intentionally deceiving themselves. We have confirmed that in every village infiltrated by the Communist Party, the peasants are swept away with all their belongings and flee in terror. The Communist Party's goal is to create chaos in order to overthrow the government and then establish a Communist government on the ruins.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Will Fly to Siping Today; He Held a Military Conference in Shenyang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] Chief of Staff Chen is scheduled to fly to Siping with Chen Mingren on the 14th and will stay in Shenyang for four more days after returning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Chief of Staff Chen, accompanied by Commissioner Feng Yong, visited Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, and Ma Zhanshan, three gentlemen of the Northeast, at 10 a.m. on the 13th, and then attended a luncheon hosted by Director Xiong. In the afternoon, he held a military conference at the Commander's Headquarters at approximately 4 p.m. In the evening, Commander Du hosted a banquet for Chief of Staff Chen, Commander-in-Chief Guo, and others at his residence, inviting various military and political officials to accompany him.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] The Shenyang Air Defense Command Headquarters held its first protection meeting on the 13th, deciding to build trenches and instill air defense knowledge in the people to cope with the tense situation at home and abroad. It is also learned that the Northeast will continue to increase its troop strength.</p>
<p>Northeast War Situation Focus Shifts Eastward; National Army Encirclement of Meihekou on Three Sides</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] It has been raining continuously in the Changnan area. The focus of the war situation in the Northeast is gradually shifting eastward from the muddy roads on the left side of the Changchun Railway. Since the National Army successively captured Xifeng, Yitong, and Shuangyang, and controlled Xian and Dongfeng counties, the square area in southern Jilin, surrounded by the Changchun, Pingmei, and Jimei railway lines, has returned to the control of the National Army. Currently, the main force of the bandit army continues to retreat eastward from the Pingmei line (Siping to Meihekou), and the National Army is currently pursuing in several directions, tightening the encirclement and annihilation of the main force of the communist bandits in Meihekou. The bandit army on the west side of the Jihai Road is currently entrenched in Chaoyangtong (70 miles west of Panshi), Shahe Town, and Taiping Town, hindering the eastward advance of the National Army. It is generally expected that if the bandit army insists on defending Meihekou to the death, it will inevitably suffer the fate of being encircled and annihilated, as the National Army's forces advancing east in a roundabout way from Yantongshan, Yitong, and Pingmei have now completed the encirclement of Meihekou on three sides.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Will Depart This Week; American Newspapers Value Wedemeyer's Assignment to China; The White House and the State Department Remain Silent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The White House and the State Department remain silent on the true meaning of General Wedemeyer's mission, awaiting the results of Wedemeyer's comprehensive assessment of the local situation. It is reported that Wedemeyer will depart within the next week and return to the United States in the second half of August.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Wu Tiecheng, vice president of the Legislative Yuan, told a United Press reporter today: "General Wedemeyer's visit to China and Korea as a special envoy of the President is very welcome news. Wedemeyer cooperated with us in Chongqing in the past, and he was aware of our problems and examined our difficulties at that time. We greatly admire his talent and vision. We are very pleased that he has come in person to inspect and analyze our current problems. We firmly believe that the results of Wedemeyer's inspection will clarify misunderstandings about our government. The results of the inspection will make an appropriate contribution to the United States' formation of its long-term policy on Asian issues."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to Li Ruoquan, chief secretary of the Sino-Korean Cultural Association in this city, the association is preparing sufficient materials for General Wedemeyer to refer to when he visits China and Korea, and will also convene cultural figures and experts on Eastern issues to hold a symposium to gather valuable opinions for General Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The significance of General Wedemeyer's appointment to China lies not only in the selection of the person (Wedemeyer is considered one of the top military strategists in the United States), but also in the timing of his appointment. Previously, it was believed that the United States' policy toward China needed to be re-considered on fundamental issues after Walter Bedell Smith, the Counselor of the Embassy to China, returned home. Truman's appointment of Wedemeyer before Smith's return may indicate the urgency of the situation in the Far East. In light of the tense struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, the situation in China and Korea can no longer be isolated from European issues. The Christian Science Monitor first interviewed Stanford, a reporter for the State Department, and reported yesterday that "the United States is conducting a major review of its China policy," making the following meaningful argument. Stanford said: "Well-informed sources in Washington unanimously believe that the events that have occurred in Europe in recent months cannot be separated from developments in Asia. Washington authorities believe that Soviet foreign policy contains expansionist pressure when it comes into contact with the non-Soviet world. If this is the case, then the United States is taking the lead in sending one of America's top strategists, General Wedemeyer, to China and Korea to conduct an on-site assessment of the critical situation in order to guard against the Soviet Union's experiments! The White House's statement that Wedemeyer will 'make an assessment of the situation' raises the question of whether Wedemeyer's mission will go beyond economic assistance to the two countries. New York newspapers have not yet commented on Wedemeyer's appointment."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 13th] TASS reported from Washington on the 12th, commenting on Wedemeyer's mission to China, saying that the Truman administration plans to provide new assistance to China.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Conduct a Thorough Review of Its China Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] President Truman's dispatch of former U.S. military commander of the China theater, General Wedemeyer, to China and Korea to investigate the actual situation confirms that the United States will conduct a thorough review of its China policy. Wedemeyer's investigation results can help the authorities decide whether the United States is willing to risk Soviet opposition to assist Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in suppressing the communists, and to what extent it will provide assistance. Wedemeyer's review of U.S. policy toward China will involve the  foundations of loans and arms supplies. According to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, China needs a "political loan" of US$200 billion for construction purposes. Small loans from the Export-Import Bank will be handled separately. However, diplomatic officials here still believe that if the U.S. government decides to provide assistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek must effectively eliminate diehards and accommodate more democratic elements.</p>
<h3>Effective Assistance to China to Make It a Pillar of Asia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Reliable sources familiar with Far Eastern events suggested on the 13th that the Wedemeyer delegation to the Far East will help U.S. officials decide whether there is a "center" in the East where economic and political stability is possible, and whose position is as important as that of the Ruhr in the Marshall Plan for European recovery. One of the strong opinions among officials here is that China under the rule of the Kuomintang should be supported in its industrial development. This would not only preserve China from communist control, but also make China a pillar of all of Asia. Another faction believes that this development in China is not guaranteed, and at best will be very slow and difficult.</p>
<p>Within the latter faction, some believe that Japan is more suitable as a potential economic center in Asia. Others argue that the economic strength of the Philippines, Korea, China, Japan, and Indonesia must be gradually adjusted and increased.</p>
<p>In Europe, the Ruhr has become the center of the recovery plan because it is a source of coal production and industry. For example, Ruhr coal production, if there is a significant expansion of production, will enable factories to increase steel production, and the increase in Ruhr coal will also increase the production of chemical fertilizer plants. This would further increase food production and expand the productive capacity of workers. All of this is expected to make the people of many countries more satisfied, leading to greater political stability and reducing the threat of communism.</p>
<p>The Paris Conference will pay close attention to the Ruhr. Although there is deep skepticism in U.S. political circles about whether a type of European-style reconstruction can be carried out in Asia, there is a consensus that the Wedemeyer delegation will help formulate a policy that will translate into action, so that progress in one area can contribute its strength. One official said that what the Wedemeyer delegation can do, at the very least, is to include China and Korea in the U.S.'s broad global aid assessment, which the United States may be obligated to do in the next few years. He said: "It is especially important to assess the situation in China based on this position, because U.S. taxpayers feel heavily burdened by the recovery plans for Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Therefore, they believe that they should be carefully adjusted, with the intention of minimizing costs. Efforts are now being made to encourage every part of the world to bear all expenses on its own. This is the  core thinking of the Marshall Plan."</p>
<h3>The Principles for Reorganizing Local Governments Have Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Hu Haidou of the Democratic Socialist Party told reporters on the morning of the 13th that when Zhang Junmai visited the Chairman in Nanjing last time, he discussed not only the Mobilization Edict, but also made decisions on the reorganization of local governments. The revitalization of local politics discussed in recent political meetings will reorganize a portion of local governments, and the opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party, the China Youth Party, and the government on this issue have converged. Both the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party will participate in the reorganization of local governments. In addition, the reorganization of local governments across the country this time is in the nature of a transfer, because current officials are not allowed to be elected locally during this year's elections. Therefore, after this exchange, local officials can be successfully elected.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Wang Shiming, an opponent of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Beiping from Shanghai yesterday to conduct activities. It is said that the National Congress of the Renovation Society will be held in Shanghai on July 15th, and he will travel to Shanghai with Zhang Chongsun next week. Zhang and Wang met at Liang Qishui's residence on the 13th, and Zhang Dongsun said that he would decide whether to join the Renovation Society after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Delegation Visits the United States to Exchange Legal Opinions Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th, United Press] Chinese officials said that Dr. Wu Shangteng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, and his party are here to exchange views with U.S. officials and non-officials on legislative issues involving important interests of the people of both countries. Dr. Wu is one of the legal scholars responsible for drafting China's constitution. He visited U.S. House Speaker Martin and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton, accompanied by Ambassador Gu Weijun, and is scheduled to visit Senate Speaker Vandenberg next week. Chinese officials explained that the United States has abolished consular jurisdiction in China, so Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new phase in terms of legislative issues. In view of this, the Chinese Legislative Yuan has decided to send a delegation to the United States to explain China's legislative system and clarify the meaning and implementation of Chinese laws, thereby promoting further understanding between the two countries. Dr. Wu is prepared to answer any questions about Chinese law. The Legislative Yuan delegation will visit Chinese communities throughout the United States, and conduct a comprehensive survey of overseas Chinese's opinions on U.S. laws that are particularly relevant to them. They will also visit major cities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, South America, and the Union of South Africa.</p>
<h3>Hainan Island to Establish Special Administrative Region; Organizational Regulations Will Be Submitted to Political Conference for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the proposal to establish a Hainan Island governance, the Political Affairs Council previously resolved to approve the establishment of a special administrative region and to establish a provincial construction committee to prepare for provincial construction matters.

<h3>Flying Saucers Spotted in Shenyang and Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The flying saucer, which has become a world mystery, has been spotted over Shenyang. The first to discover it was Mr. Yan Jinbo, an employee of the Anshan Company's Shenyang office. Mr. Yan stated that at 10:30 PM on the 10th, while enjoying the cool air in front of his dormitory, he suddenly caught sight of a white, round object swiftly gliding across the high sky from northeast to southwest, lasting only a few seconds. Subsequently, at intervals of less than a minute, another one would appear, all flying in the same direction, seemingly with great regularity. Initially, he thought it was smoke from a neighboring chimney, but he later realized that if it were gas, it could not be so round and shiny. Mr. Yan said, "At that time, all his family members were already asleep, so he called his colleague Zhang Rongshao to watch together, and the objects continued to fly for an hour. They disappeared at 11:30 PM." According to Mr. Zhang's calculations, they saw more than 80 of them in one hour. Mr. Zhang said that the object was very round, and from the ground, it appeared to be about four feet in diameter, milky white with a slight hint of light blue, resembling a jade plate. However, he believed that it was not a substantial object, nor was it a searchlight, as searchlights would have beams of light radiating from the ground, which this did not. Mr. Zhang said that he immediately thought that this might be the flying saucer discovered in the United States, but he could not obtain any strong evidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] According to reporters informed by firefighters in this city, at around 11:00 AM on the 13th, a radiant, circular object was spotted at an altitude of over 3,000 meters above the urban area, slowly ascending. After about fifteen minutes, it drifted towards the southeast. It is generally speculated that it may be a flying saucer.</p>

<h3>Sophistry and Strong Arguments Regarding the Lushun-Dalian Issue: USSR Lacks Sincerity in Fulfilling the Treaty; We Firmly Demand Military Police Entry into Both Areas</h3>
<p>Talks with a Certain Key Official in Charge of Northeast Takeover</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to a TASS report published on the 11th, the Soviet Union's communique regarding our statement on Lushun-Dalian contained many defenses. A Central News Agency reporter recently inquired about this with a military official from our Northeast takeover agency, who said: "The Soviet government's communique is clearly sophistry, as anyone with discerning eyes can see, and there is no need for us to argue further. What our government firmly demands is that Chinese troops and police be allowed to enter Dalian and Lushun to protect the safety and freedom of Chinese takeover administrative personnel. This is clearly permitted by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, or at least not prohibited by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If the Chinese takeover agency cannot obtain full protection from government troops and police, the result can be inferred from the situation when Soviet troops occupied Changchun last year. At that time, the Soviet army was responsible for the area, similar to today's Lushun. At that time, the Soviet government also promised to give us all assistance, but because our takeover agency had no government troops or police and no freedom to send troops and police to Changchun, it almost became a prisoner of the CCP. At that time, the threats and harassment from the CCP inside and outside the city even cut off our headquarters' external communications. If our Lushun-Dalian takeover agency does not have sufficient government troops and police to protect it, based on past experience, it must prepare to be a prisoner of those who oppose the government or a puppet of others. Our diplomatic authorities insist that our military police must be able to freely reside in Dalian because we do not want our Lushun-Dalian takeover personnel to be prisoners or puppets of any party. Their stance and attitude are extremely proper. The Soviet government should quickly correct its attitude, otherwise, everyone will believe that it has no sincerity in fulfilling the treaty."</p>
<p>Note: The TASS statement carried by Soviet newspapers on the 11th is roughly as follows: "As early as December 1945 and January 1946, the Soviet military authorities notified Chinese representatives that the Soviet Union intended to provide all assistance to China in establishing a government in Dalian. However, although China appointed officials to the area, not a single one went to Dalian to take office. Because the Soviet side requested the Chinese government again in December 1946 to reappoint officials to Lushun-Dalian, and then again on March 7, 1947, but received no response. This has caused those who do not understand the truth to draw incorrect conclusions. The Chinese communique also states that the CCP is increasing its forces in the Lushun-Dalian area, which is also without basis, as there are no CCP troops in the area. Furthermore, China's dispatch of troops to the Lushun naval base violates Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement, which entrusts the defense to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Chinese troops are not allowed to be stationed in the area. The agreement on Dalian also does not allow Chinese troops to be stationed in the urban area, and during the war against Japan, Dalian should be managed by the wartime government of the wartime naval zone. Currently, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, and we are still in a state of war against Japan, so Dalian is still under the administration of the military government. The Soviet government believes that the Chinese government's claim that the Chinese government in the area cannot perform its duties without the assistance of Chinese troops has no basis, because the Soviet government allows the Chinese police to be sent to the area, which can fully maintain order. The Soviet Union has fulfilled its obligations in supporting and providing military assistance to the Chinese government and respecting China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, eliminating Japanese troops in the three northeastern provinces, and then withdrawing its troops to respect China's sovereignty."</p>
<h3>Joint Effort by the Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to Dredge Accumulated Water in the Yellow River Flooded Area; Project Planned and Ready for Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] In view of the fact that accumulated water in the Yellow River flooded area is hindering the return of refugees to their farms, Chen Panling, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, has reportedly obtained the consent of the Henan branch of UNRRA to jointly form a Flood Area Water Conservancy Engineering Supervision Committee to determine construction methods. The scope of the project is limited to the southern waterways of the Jialu River system, including the triangular area west of the Jialu River, south of the Shuangbo River, and west of the Sha River. Due to incomplete data, the construction plan is temporarily based on the original preliminary plan of the Yellow River, selecting key points for drafting. A total of 5 billion yuan in construction funds and 5,000 tons of work rations will be used to complete the project by the end of the year. Regarding the funding and organization of the construction team, the branch office will allocate 1 billion yuan for management fees from the 5 billion yuan in water conservancy funds in the flooded area. From the six survey teams of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau in the flooded area, four teams will specialize in surveying. The other two teams will be reorganized into construction teams, and one more team will be added to handle construction matters. The salaries of all employees will be in accordance with the Bureau's salaries, plus 50%. It is heard that construction can begin soon, so that the flooded area of the past decade can be transformed into a paradise with crisscrossing ditches.</p>
<h3>Does the Yellow River Flow Through Sichuan Province? So Says Sichuan Provincial Assemblyman Ma Bijie</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th] According to Sichuan Provincial Assemblyman Ma Bijie of Songpan, when talking to reporters, the Yellow River originates from the Bayan Har Mountains, and most people believe that it flows through nine provinces including Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi, but this is not entirely true. After originating from the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai, the Yellow River turns southeast and flows through the Sanheba area in Songpan, Sichuan, and then turns north and flows into Gansu. The length of the Yellow River in Sichuan is approximately 300 li, and there is a river bend. The cattle, sheep, and horses raised by the local aborigines depend on this for drinking water and grazing. The terrain of Songpan resembles a snake, extending westward from Songpan County to the Kunlun Mountains, a length of approximately 2,000 li. The people in this area are purely aborigines, still living an ancient nomadic life, with no culture to speak of. They do not communicate with the outside world, so the fact that the upper reaches of the Yellow River flow through Sichuan is rarely known to the world. It is unknown whether Ma's statement is true, but it is worthy of exploration by geographers.</p>
<h3>Laid-Off Workers of the Shanghai Naval Shipyard Petition</h3>
<p>Relevant Authorities Discussing Solutions</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] A delegation of petitioners from the laid-off workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Shanghai Gaochang Temple Naval Shipyard, led by Le Junyu, came to Nanjing to petition various relevant ministries and departments. On the 13th at 2 PM, they received reporters and reported their five key demands: (1) Requesting the government to subsidize shipbuilding funds; (2) Requesting the government to quickly allocate US$500,000 in foreign exchange; (3) Requesting job security; (4) Requesting the reinstatement of 800 laid-off workers; (5) Opposing shift adjustments. The Naval Headquarters was very sympathetic to them, but due to the lack of domestic materials and the department's tight budget, this problem could not be solved independently. After contacting other agencies, a response will be given. The representatives of the petition delegation will continue to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 14th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Various agencies of the Executive Yuan will hold a meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs at 3 PM on the 14th to resolve the issue of laid-off workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard. The representatives attending the meeting will be Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs; Sun Bo, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau; Qian Yuanfu, Director of the Sixth Department of the Ministry of National Defense; Zhou Yongneng, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance; Peng Erkang, Secretary of the Central Organization Department; and Yuan Qijiong, Director of the Labor Movement Division of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department. The meeting will be presided over by Secretary-General Gan Yongguang. It is reported that the meeting may involve the principle of handling Japan's compensation to China for shipbuilding equipment. During the time when Song Ziwen was the head of the Executive Yuan, it was planned to use the equipment to set up another shipbuilding factory in Wusong. The naval authorities believed that the Jiangnan Shipyard had a long history and that accepting commercial ship repairs was its normal business. It was proposed to use the compensation equipment to expand the Jiangnan Shipyard. Therefore, the principle has been suspended for a long time. Recently, Jiangnan has been unable to obtain copper and iron, and its business has been sluggish, so it has had to lay off workers. If the meeting can make a decision on this principle and resolve the supply of shipbuilding materials, and with the gradual arrival of the equipment and ships compensated by the Japanese side, the layoff problem can be solved in conjunction.</p>

<h3>Sister's Brother-in-Law of Yoshiko Kawashima Arrested for Swindling; Hirokuni Otsuka Impersonated a Chinese General and Deceived Japanese Companies, Exposed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Hirokuni Otsuka, the brother-in-law of the Japanese female spy Yoshiko Kawashima, has been swindling in Osaka and Tokyo for a year, impersonating a Chinese general and claiming to be very friendly with Chairman Chiang. He has now been arrested by the Tokyo Prison for fraud. The suspect is 55 years old, bald, and has a large belly. He held forged certificates from the Chinese government, calling himself General Wang Zhike, and recommended himself to the financial world, exposing the goods hidden by the Japanese army and navy. He claimed that some of the goods should have been transferred to the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, but are still hidden. After these goods are discovered, the Chinese government will order them to be transported to China, and some of them will be used in Japan. Therefore, he falsely promised Japanese companies preferential rights and defrauded them of approximately 20 million yen. After a long time, the goods were not delivered, and the companies became suspicious and inquired with the Osaka office of our delegation in Japan. After investigation, he was finally arrested last month. The suspect is from Tokyo, born in Osaka. At the age of 17, he went to the Northeast to train children, and trained a large number of Japanese children to pretend to be Chinese. In 1933, he was tried for defrauding a famous Northeast businessman in Osaka of 2 million yen and fabricating sensational news. After his arrest last month, the police found a large number of penicillin and cigars in his home, worth approximately 700,000 yen. According to the Osaka Prison, after being imprisoned, he still denied smuggling goods and committing fraud, claiming: "I am under the command of the Chinese government's Peace Allied Forces." Such troops have never been heard of, and his lies are ridiculous.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Merger of the Party and the Youth League</h3>
<p>The Central Standing Committee passed the unified organization of the Party and the Youth League on the 9th. The reason given was to unify the revolutionary front, strengthen the power of the Party and the Youth League, take unified steps, and quell the communist rebellion. Minister Bai, on the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Youth League, encouraged the youth, saying: "In our revolutionary camp, there are still remnants of feudalism existing within it. The head of the Youth League has a far-sighted vision, so he recently gave clear instructions that the Party and the Youth League must be merged to thoroughly transform our Party, so as to unify our strength to cooperate with the national policy of suppressing the communist rebellion. This is to adapt to the needs of the current stage of the revolution and is also a good opportunity for the rebirth of the Party and the Youth League." This is a clear and decisive decision to transform the affairs of the Youth League and the Party to adapt to the needs of the times.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People Youth League was established in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). On March 29th of that year, the Kuomintang Provisional National Congress decided to revise the Party Constitution and add Article 5: "This Party establishes the Three Principles of the People Youth League to train youth." On June 16th of that year, President Chiang, concurrently the head of the Youth League, issued a letter to the youth of the whole country and announced the constitution of the Youth League. On August 1st, the head of the Youth League and all those below took an oath to join the Youth League. From then on, the Youth League carried out national policies and participated in the War of Resistance with full vigor, shedding blood on the front lines and sweating in the rear, and once wrote magnificent poems that were inspiring and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>During the most critical period of the War of Resistance, the Central Government launched the "100,000 Youth Volunteering for Military Service" campaign. The youth responded enthusiastically, rolled up their sleeves, and volunteered to kill the enemy. In less than a day, more than 150,000 people were registered and enlisted, and more than 93,000 people were called up and enlisted by the Youth League at all levels, exceeding the original quota by almost one fold, eventually encouraging the military and the people, eliminating the strong enemy, and winning the victory. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Youth League organizations at all levels in the enemy areas changed from secret activities to public activities, assisting the National Army in taking over and cooperating with the government in repatriation work, making great achievements.</p>
<p>At this time, the Communist bandits are rebelling against the country and dismembering the nation. Domestic disturbances are imminent, and there is a fierce ideological struggle internationally. In order to strengthen the revolutionary ranks and concentrate revolutionary forces, the central authorities believe that the Party and the Youth League must be unified, and Party members and Youth League members must be united as one family. This is very consistent with what President Chiang said: "The Kuomintang is the artery of the country, and the Three Principles of the People Youth League is the fresh blood输 in the artery." Arteries and fresh blood输 originally belong to one family and are absolutely inseparable from each other. The artery is the engine of all life forces, and blood is the source of all abilities. The Kuomintang is older and fears arteriosclerosis. The addition of the fresh blood输 of the young Youth League can produce a new and renewed effect. This is an important .</p>
<p>The Party and the Youth League are originally inseparable. The leaders are the same, the principles are the same, the ideology is consistent, and the goals are the same. Now the work is also similar. The Youth League accepts the leadership of the Party, and the Party supports the development of the Youth League. It has always been a case of different paths leading to the same goal. In the future, forming an integrated whole will be even more a matter of being in the same boat. The Youth League has joined the Party's organization, and the Party has gained a new force from the Youth League, and should exert its strength even more. The youth movement of the past sixty years has always been a revolutionary movement. The first period was to eliminate the autocratic regime and create the Republic of China. The second period was to overthrow the warlords and unify the country. The third period was to fight the war of resistance while abolishing unequal treaties. Today, we have stepped into the fourth period, which is also the later period of the revolutionary movement. The main task is to quell the communist rebellion and establish the country under the constitution. This is the new work after the rebirth of the Party and the Youth League, but it is a consistent old mission of the revolution.</p>
<p>How will the Party and the Youth League be unified? How to merge the families? The central authorities have decided to set up a "Research Association for the Unified Organization of the Party and the Youth League" and a "Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and the Youth League" to study and implement the matter separately. There is no need for further discussion. However, one point to note is that the organizations should become unified, and must become "chemical" organizations, so as to avoid setting up separate factions and dividing each other. At the same time, it is hoped that the Party will not "rely on its age to sell its experience", but will "stay young as it gets older", and that the Youth League will avoid "youthful vigor", but should bring some "precociousness" so that they can be as harmonious as water and milk, and be united against the outside world. This time, President Chiang, on the ninth anniversary of the Youth League, earnestly encouraged us, saying: "We should recognize the importance of the current revolutionary environment and revolutionary responsibilities, and, based on the spirit of self-criticism, thoroughly review the past, improve all shortcomings, strengthen the revolutionary organization, and strengthen discipline and concentrate our forces to eliminate revolutionary obstacles." Only in this way can we complete the great cause of the revolution.</p>
<h3>Celebrating French National Day</h3>
<p>Today is French National Day. 158 years ago today, the French people heroically stormed the Bastille prison, overthrew the French monarchy, and established the First Republic. They also issued the "Declaration of the Rights of Man," using "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" as their slogan, calling out to the people of all countries in the world. From then on, the revolutionary movements in various countries surged like a storm, all caused by the inspiration of the French Revolution. Today, as we celebrate French National Day, in addition to admiring the spirit of the French Revolution, we especially admire the ideals of the French Revolution—Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.</p>
<p>Although the slogan of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity has been shouted for 158 years, it has not yet been fully realized. Taking France itself as an example, although it has gone through four revolutions and established four republican regimes, the ideals that were envisioned during the French Revolution of 1789 have not yet been fully realized. Post-war France, on the surface, appears to be progressive and leaning to the left, but in reality, it is still quite far from the ideals of the French Revolution. The Ramadier cabinet, although it is a united government representing the entire country, the Communist Party recently withdrew from the government again, becoming a united government in name only. The French government faces the possibility of political unrest every day. In terms of economy, France was exhausted after the war and is still full of scars. To rebuild from the ruins, it is all in vain without foreign aid. At the same time, France still adopts the previous imperialist attitude towards its overseas colonies and adopts a high-pressure policy against the Viet Minh, which is a perfect example. Therefore, we are not very optimistic about the future of the French Fourth Republic government.</p>
<p>If we re-evaluate the current world with the three slogans of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, we feel that the progress of mankind is really too slow. Since the French Revolution, the revolutionary movements in various countries have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, either demanding independent national movements or democratic revolutionary movements internally. However, 150 years later, looking at the situation in various countries around the world, there are still many countries that, although they are independent and autonomous on the surface, inevitably have to be vassals of major powers. Their internal affairs are subject to interference, and their diplomacy cannot be independent. The fact that some European countries recently could not freely decide to participate in the European Economic Conference is a powerful proof.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the ideals of the French Revolution, whether from the perspective of France itself or from the perspective of various countries in the world, have not been fully realized even after 158 years of human struggle, and still require the joint efforts of the people of all countries to strive for the realization of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity!</p>

<h3>European Conference Progressing Rapidly; General Assembly Passes Report of the Working Committee; Small Countries Obtain Decisive Right to Speak</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 13th broadcast: The European Economic Cooperation Conference held its second plenary session today, lasting one hour and fifteen minutes. It unanimously passed the report of the Working Committee and announced that the conference's door remains open to Central and Eastern Europe, which are controlled by the Soviet Union and refuse to attend the conference. The conference will also establish a and institution to determine the joint relief plan for various European countries. The Working Committee will meet on the afternoon of the 14th to finalize its report.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The Paris Conference opened on the morning of the 12th. The preliminary stage of the Paris Conference, under the leadership of Britain and France, has been advancing rapidly and in a completely unified atmosphere, which is rare in various international conferences after the end of the war. This rapid action is probably due to the absence of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries such as Poland and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Well-informed British sources here said today that the European Economic Conference is expected to make great progress by the 16th of this month. At that time, Foreign Secretary Bevin will be able to return to London quickly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The Working Committee of the European Conference, composed of representatives from 16 countries, met here this afternoon for nearly five hours to discuss the next action of the General Assembly. Achille Alphand, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Working Committee, and another French representative, Serruys, was elected as Secretary-General. The meeting discussed the draft procedures and organization proposed by Britain and France. After listening to the opinions of other countries, the Chairman will prepare a revised organizational plan and submit it to the Working Committee meeting at noon tomorrow. The Working Committee has four tasks: (1) to prepare a draft procedure; (2) to prepare a draft organization; (3) to decide on the organization and personnel of the committees established in accordance with the first two drafts; (4) to recommend the Secretary-General of each committee and subcommittee. Regarding the organizational plan, it is roughly similar to what is outlined in the British and French invitations, including the establishment of a permanent Executive Committee and four permanent technical committees to study food and agriculture, steel, fuel and electricity, and transportation separately. The Working Committee is expected to submit a report to the Plenary Assembly before Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The small European countries won a victory in the 16-nation European Economic Recovery Conference on the 12th, obtaining a decisive right to speak when drafting the European relief plan. The small countries decided in a four-and-a-half-hour "Working Committee meeting" that all countries should obtain seats to draft the relief and economic plans required by each participating country and submit them to the United States before September 1. The Working Committee has agreed on the establishment methods of more than half of the organizations in the European relief plan and hopes to reach a complete agreement by the afternoon of the 15th. The organizations that have been agreed upon are: (1) the Working Committee, composed of representatives from 16 countries; (2) the Executive Committee, which implements the resolutions of the Working Committee. How it will be organized has not yet been determined; (3) four technical subcommittees on fuel and electricity, food, steel, and transportation. The main members of each subcommittee are limited to those from the producing countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] According to authoritative sources here: Britain and France plan to make a final appeal to the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe before the end of the Paris Conference, inviting them to participate in the Marshall Plan in time before it is too late. This appeal may ease the diplomatic counterattack against the Marshall Plan. It is rumored that the Soviet Union is planning to organize a firmer economic group in Eastern Europe under the auspices of Moscow. Regarding what senior American officials here said two days ago that the Paris Conference was the "final invitation," any country that does not respond will not be able to enjoy the aid of the Marshall Plan. According to news from Washington, the door to assistance is still open. The leaders of Britain and France are deeply concerned about this apparent disagreement and hope that authoritative parties will clarify this point as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Attempting to Sabotage Marshall's Plan to Aid Europe; The Soviet Union Will Eventually Work Hard in Vain; The United States Is Determined to Deal with Any Provocation by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] American officials said today that the Soviet Union's attempt to split Europe and sabotage Marshall's plan to aid Europe will eventually work hard in vain and achieve nothing. It is reported that although the countries of the Soviet bloc refuse to participate in the Paris Economic Conference, they are still willing to share the United States' economic aid to Europe. The United States' attitude from now on is roughly as follows: (1) The United States government is determined to do its best to support the reasonable European recovery plan produced by the Paris Conference, regardless of how the Soviet Union opposes it. (2) The United States government does not want to force a showdown with the Soviet Union in political and economic relations and in the United Nations organization at this time, but will deal with any provocation by the Soviet Union's forces. (3) The United States government may expedite the resolution of certain cases between the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the political situation in Hungary and the situation in the Balkans. These issues are probably major disputes in the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly in September of this year. (4) The United States government does not want to close any road to cooperation between Eastern and Western Europe at this time. The United States does not recognize fixed Eastern and Western blocs. (5) The current competition in Europe is a test of all the political and economic resources between the United States and the Soviet Union, that is, a struggle between American capitalism and democracy and Soviet communism and dictatorship. This test will continue for many years, and the economic prosperity of Europe is one stage of it, but the relationship is extremely important.</p>
<p>American Trade Experts Observe European Economy</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] A trade expert on the Soviet Union in the Department of Commerce said today that, based on a study of Soviet publications and Eastern European trade statistics, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Paris Economic Conference was a foolish move that caused great damage to itself, and its industry and commerce will become even more unable to recover. The Soviet Union has a population of 196 million, and the Eastern European countries have a population of 90 million. They will all suffer the same fate and need more machinery and more skilled workers. Now that both are lacking, the Soviet Union's standard of living cannot be improved, and the standard of living in Eastern European countries will decline. The Soviet authorities' attempt to "sell" communism to their people will be hit.</p>
<h3>Austria Participates in the European Conference; The Communist Party Expresses Support</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Vienna, 12th] Electrical Minister Jardemenn, the only member of the Austrian government who is a Communist, told this agency's reporter on the 12th that the Austrian Communist Party fully supports the Austrian delegation attending the European Conference. The Austrian Communist Party believes that no loyal Austrian or Communist is willing to lose the opportunity for relief, so it advocates participating in the European Conference. The Austrian Communist Party also hopes that the European Conference can formulate a relief plan that can be fully endorsed by the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Laski Dissatisfied With Marshall's Plan to Aid Europe</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] Former British Labour Party leader Laski recently expressed his views on the Marshall Plan at a Labour Party meeting in Essex City, saying: Britain does not want to become the 49th state of the United States. We are unwilling to cater to the United States, nor are we willing to change our policies in exchange for its financial assistance. Britain cannot be controlled by foreign countries. I do not know what Marshall's plan is. I think Marshall himself does not know it either. If Britain does not want to suffer an "economic Dunkirk," Britain only needs the friendship of the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<h3>Czech Republic Changes Course Midway; French Leaders Express Concern</h3>
<p>Will Question Bidault</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Schumann, leader of the French Popular Republican Movement, recently declared: When the National Assembly meets next time, I will question Foreign Minister Bidault about the Czech Republic's change of heart and refusal to participate in the Paris Conference. The Czech Republic is the only country within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union that once accepted the invitation of Britain and France, but the result was a change of heart midway.</p>
<h3>Romanian Prime Minister Visits Bulgaria to Discuss Molotov's Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 12th] Five senior Romanian government leaders left here today for Sofia to hold important talks with the Bulgarian government in order to establish another close link within the framework of the Soviet Union's organization of Eastern Europe. Economic Minister and Communist Party Secretary-General Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej is also one of the representatives. Before his departure, he gave a speech expressing that he would try to strengthen Balkan cooperation to prevent reactionary elements from infringing on the independence and sovereignty of the Balkan democratic countries. Gheorghiu-Dej has just returned from Moscow. He stayed in the Soviet capital for eight days and discussed with various leaders the policies of the "Molotov Plan" aimed at countering the "Marshall Plan." According to extremely reliable sources, the main agenda of the Sofia conference is to discuss the mutual assistance treaty and close economic relations between Romania and Bulgaria. The Romanian delegation is personally led by Prime Minister Groza. Prime Minister Groza has also declared that after completing his trip to Sofia, he will go to Prague to hold similar negotiations with the Czech government.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on European Conference; Exposing Soviet Intentions</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The "Sunday Times" warned today that Yugoslavia may invade the Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Styria as part of its efforts to disrupt the Paris Economic Recovery Conference. Once the Austrian peace treaty is signed and British troops withdraw from Austria, Yugoslavia will launch a violent coup in these two provinces to complete the Eastern European bloc. The Soviet Union can enter Italy directly from Hungary, and Yugoslavia's transportation can also be improved. However, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault regard the Paris Conference as a business conference and are wholeheartedly making it a success. The "Sunday Herald" said that the Soviet Union's next action will be to launch a Molotov Plan in Eastern Europe to compete with the Marshall Plan in Western Europe, but this plan can only give the Eastern European countries lukewarm comfort. At most, the Soviet Union can only provide these countries with some limited industrial assistance. The Soviet Union is clearly determined to make Europe into two mutually hostile Eastern and Western blocs. The biggest difficulty of the Paris Conference is that the Soviet Union not only refuses to participate in the conference, but also clearly wants to do its best to disrupt it.</p>
<h3>Eastern Europe Welcomes American Loans but Opposes Britain and France as Intermediaries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] Soviet commentator Marinin and Léontiev published an article in "Pravda" today commenting on the European Economic Cooperation Conference currently being held in Paris. The article said: The Eastern European countries have often declared that they are willing to accept foreign loans, but they are unwilling to have Britain and France as brokers. Is it right for the British and French leaders to instruct the drafting of the European economic plan, or even draft it alone? Britain and France rely more on American financial assistance and less on their own economic plans in carrying out their reconstruction work. In the Eastern and Central European countries, they all base their plans on their own resources and are currently achieving undeniable success. Britain and France are far behind the Eastern European countries in this regard. Can they give the Eastern European countries lessons? In short, the Eastern European countries hope to negotiate directly with their lending countries, while Britain and France are attempting to monopolize the power to distribute American loans.</p>
<h3>Romania Arrests Opposition Party Members - British and American Protests Rejected</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 12th] Regarding the Romanian government's recent large-scale arrest of opposition party members, the British and American governments have issued notes to Romania expressing their protests. It is now learned that the Romanian government delivered replies to the British and American chargés d'affaires in Romania today, rejecting the British and American protests, calling them interference in Romania's internal affairs, and stating that there are no provisions in the peace treaty with Romania that allow signatory countries to interfere in Romania's internal affairs.</p>
<h3>American Experts Predict - Economic Decline in the United States Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Advisors to the US government and President Truman are no longer afraid of a decline in national business in mid-1947. Instead, they are studying whether the high level of the US economy will tend towards inflation. Most government economic experts had predicted that prices would fall slightly after July 1st, but now they mostly predict that prices will reach a high point again in August and September. According to a report from the Census Bureau, civilian employment in the United States reached 60 million in June, which is a peak in both peacetime and wartime. Therefore, there will be no immediate decline, and the income and purchasing power of this large group of employed people must be considered by President Truman in his mid-year report on the national economy. This report will be submitted to Congress next week. The President's Economic Advisory Council presented the President and the Cabinet with various facts on the prosperity issue yesterday. Based on various figures and forecasts, there are concerns that the nation's ability to resist the inflationary tide may weaken.</p>
<h3>Bevin Meets with Ramadier</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with French Prime Minister Ramadier at 6:30 this afternoon, talked for fifty minutes, and left at 7:20.</p>
<h3>Eva Perón to Visit England</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th Broadcast: According to a member of the Argentine President's wife's entourage, Eva Perón has changed her itinerary and plans to visit London. She is expected to depart on Wednesday. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said that the embassy had returned a document from the British Foreign Office to Eva Perón, welcoming her visit to Britain. At the same time, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: Princess Elizabeth had previously expressed her willingness to meet with Eva Perón.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Czech Trade Agreement Signed - Soviets to Export Wheat in Exchange for Industrial Products</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 12th] Following the conclusion of a five-year trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, Prague and Moscow simultaneously issued communiqués, stating that Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on "important issues of international politics." The communiqué did not detail the political issues discussed, but said that special attention was paid to economic issues, and it was decided to expand economic relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. According to the trade agreement signed between the two countries, the Soviet Union should supply Czechoslovakia with 200,000 tons each of wheat and feed, as well as wool, fertilizer, hemp, cotton, iron, magnesium, and chromium ore next year. Czechoslovakia will supply the Soviet Union with industrial products, including train locomotives and generators, the quantity of which will be determined annually. The Soviet Union can order the goods it needs for the entire term from Czechoslovakia. Observers expect that this trade agreement may immediately stimulate Czech industry and agriculture. However, it is difficult to say for the time being whether Czechoslovakia can completely avoid relying on Western countries as a result.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Diplomatic circles here believe that if the British-Soviet commercial negotiations break down, the Soviet Union will export its abundant wheat harvest this year to its satellite countries. Although the Soviet satellite countries refused to attend the Paris Conference, they indicated that they hoped to obtain foreign loans.</p>
<h3>British and American Occupation Zones in Germany - Increase German Industrial Production</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 13th] US Military Commander Clay and British Military Commander Robertson held a meeting here today to discuss a new level agreement for industrial production in the US and British occupation zones in Germany. The agreement will be signed and announced next Wednesday. It is reported that this new level will stipulate an annual steel production of about 12 million tons, which is approximately half of Germany's total pre-war output, more than double the 5.8 million tons last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Authoritative government sources announced today: The US proposal to postpone the implementation of the British-proposed Ruhr coal mine nationalization plan for five years is causing divergent opinions among the authorities of the British and American occupation forces in Germany. Discussions on this matter have been ongoing for almost a year, and have now reached a deadlock. However, the two governments have agreed to continue seeking a compromise solution. Former US Secretary of State Byrnes expressed his opinion last summer that socialism could be implemented if the German people expressed their support.</p>
<h3>Former US Ambassador to the Philippines Declares - The United States Should Pay Attention to the Far East - The Marshall Plan Should Be Expanded to Asia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Howard newspaper writer Edson, after interviewing former US Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt, said: McNutt very much wants a "Far East Marshall Plan," but "the biggest problem is where to start." McNutt suggested that a survey should be conducted before starting. How much assistance can the United States give to the war-torn areas? At the same time, attention should be paid to what the United States needs from various parts of the world. After the forms are collected, McNutt believes that this will show that what the United States needs most is raw materials, such as leather, fat, vegetable oil, tin, copper, lead, zinc, ramie, coconut, spices, medicines, and other items that cannot be adequately supplied in the United States. Europe cannot fully supply this, but Asia and the Pacific Islands can produce everything we need. McNutt believes that all the necessary factors for increasing trade are now available, which is why he said we should pay more attention to the East.</p>
<h3>France Celebrates National Day</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] Tomorrow is the French National Day. The entire city has begun to hang flags to celebrate, and citizens are preparing to hold street dances to celebrate wildly. Shelters are being built along the roadside, bands are playing songs, and the original cafes are expanding their sites, encroaching on the road surface, and arranging small tables and chairs, making it difficult for cars to drive through the crowds. The authorities have now specially permitted people to dance all night in public squares from tonight until Monday.</p>
<h3>Bevin to Broadcast Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] It was officially announced here today that tomorrow is the French Revolution Memorial Day. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will broadcast to the French people in English. It is expected that Bevin will emphasize the need for closer cooperation between Britain and France.</p>
<h3>British Mediterranean Fleet to Visit the Black Sea</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] The Naval Command announced today that the British Mediterranean Fleet is scheduled to depart from Malta on the 17th of this month, led by the 10,000-ton cruiser "Liverpool" of Commander-in-Chief Williams, for a summer cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea, lasting five weeks. The ships will visit various ports in Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Palestine, Turkey, and the Soviet Crimean port of Sevastopol.</p>
<h3>French Civil Servants' Demands Not Met - General Strike Difficult to Avoid</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The new proposals put forward by the Federation of French Civil Servants and the General Confederation of Labor delegation have been rejected by Prime Minister Ramadier. According to the representatives' talks with the press, the civil servants' demands require an expenditure of 280 billion francs, which is equal to half of the national budget. The government's plan can only pay 27 billion francs in cash. Prime Minister Ramadier stated that this number is the maximum amount the government can give, and urged civil servants not to make excessive demands that endanger the country. Therefore, today's meeting ended in failure. Although the civil servants' strike has been allowed to be postponed, hope that it can be avoided is dim.</p>
<h3>Egypt to Promulgate Compulsory Military Service Law</h3>
<p>Will Increase the Army's Strength Tenfold</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 12th] It is learned that Egypt will promulgate a compulsory military service bill early next week, stipulating that the number of Egyptian army personnel will be increased from 25,000 to 250,000 in the next few years.

<p>British and Egyptian Accusations Continue</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] British officials today accused Egypt of attempting to undermine legitimate treaties in order to gain complete control of Sudan, thereby responding to Egypt's request to the Security Council that British troops immediately and completely withdraw from Egypt and Sudan. The chief British representative, Jebb, is prepared to reply and will make a counterclaim, saying that this complaint has no legitimate basis and should be dismissed immediately. Egypt filed a complaint with the United Nations organization on Friday because it failed to amend the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. However, the Security Council has a backlog of cases such as the Balkan issue, the establishment of international security forces, disarmament issues, and the control of atomic energy, and it is expected that it will not be able to discuss it within one or two weeks. Egypt accused Britain of pursuing a policy aimed at separating Sudan from Egypt, making Egyptians not trusted by Sudanese, causing discord between the two parties, and hindering the unity of the Nile Valley. British officials refuted this, saying they would prove the true basis of the issue. British and Egyptian negotiations to amend the treaty were conducted last year, but ultimately broke down due to the future status of Sudan.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tenant Gu Guisheng, a native of Pudong, who lived in the back building of No. 14 Houde Lane, Tongbei Road, works at the Xin Xin Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Xuchang Road.

<h3>Expansion of Cargo Depot and Warehouse Area, Enlargement of North Railway Station Passenger Terminal: Four Decisions Made by Zhabei West District Planning Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhabei West District Planning Committee convened a meeting at the Bureau of Public Works conference room at 3 PM the day before yesterday. During the meeting, the scope of the Zhabei West District was defined as the area west of North Xizang Road, between the Suzhou River and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, covering approximately 140 hectares. The land use decisions were as follows: (1) Seven neighborhood units (residential types: 3,326 two-story houses, 1,112 four-story houses, and 44 detached houses); (2) Adding a Suzhou River wharf and cargo depot/warehouse area; (3) Expanding the passenger terminal of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's North Station; (4) Establishing a Shanghai automobile repair plant for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Considering that the Zhabei area is close to the city center and that most of the original buildings there were destroyed by gunfire, and that the current population is over 78,500, mostly living in shantytowns, a planned revival could help solve the urban housing shortage and traffic problems. Therefore, the Urban Planning Committee has designated Zhabei as a demonstration area, and all improvement plans should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Fangxie Road Repaved with Asphalt, Huimin Bridge Reconstructed</h3>

<h3>"The Imposter" Dispute: Social Bureau to Mediate Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The film "The Imposter" has caused widespread public outrage among barbers in the city. So far, the labor union has not directly negotiated with the film company. However, to strengthen their position, the union has reached out to the barbers' guild and the Yangzhou Association for support. They held a meeting the day before yesterday at Huguo Temple on Puan Road and decided that the next step would be to demand a ban on the film's public screening. On the same day, the film company also approached the Social Bureau, claiming to be victims, and requesting assistance. It is learned that the Social Bureau has scheduled a meeting today to bring together the responsible parties from both sides for mediation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The barber industry of the whole city continued to discuss countermeasures last night at the Barber's Guild. Over two hundred people attended, including Wang Zhenchuan, chairman of the Barber's Guild, Gao Deyu of the labor union, and the heads of various groups. Jiao Dingkai, chairman of the Yangzhou seven-county association in Shanghai, was invited to provide guidance. Chairman Jiao expressed his opinion on the insulting aspects of the "The Imposter" film and gave several instructions to ensure that actions are reasonable and legal: (1) Abide by the law and maintain order; (2) Negotiate with the Wen Hua Film Company. Remain calm before a resolution, and do not be exploited or exceed the boundaries; (3) Before the film is revised, request various authorities to order Wen Hua Company to temporarily suspend screenings; (4) Send a letter to director Huang Zuolin questioning the basis of his portrayals, pointing out that he should not arbitrarily create and deliberately insult the profession; (5) The scene of "suicide by razor in pursuit of marriage" not only defames barbers but also affects social security. Depictions of barbers with hands pressed on the shoulders of female customers and various other unsightly poses affect public morals, leaving the audience with an unbelievable impression. Furthermore, the same trade in Nanjing and Hankou are sending inquiries and telegrams should be sent in return.</p>
<h3>Application for Exemption or Deferment from Military Service Must Be Completed by the 25th of This Month: Commander to Hold Reception for Various Sectors to Explain Situation, No Decision Yet on Whether Additional Conscription Will Occur During General Mobilization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gao Baoshu, spokesperson for the Shanghai Garrison Command, told our reporter that the conscription quota for the Garrison Command this year has been formally ordered by the National Government to implement a voluntary military service system. If there are not enough volunteers, the shortfall will be supplemented through conscription. The conscription quota for this year is set at 3,000 people for Shanghai City, and the conscription quota for the Shanghai Regiment Command under the Garrison Command is 200. The conscription age is for men born from 1923 to 1927 (years 12 to 16 of the Republic). Conscription will begin on the first of next month. Applications for exemption or deferment from military service and the review process have already begun, and the residents are being urged by the baojia system to complete the application process. This work must be completed by the 25th of this month and will end at the latest by the end of this month. Gao concluded: According to the investigation by the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, there are approximately 460,000 able-bodied men born between 1923 and 1927 in Shanghai. Considering that Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, the government has only allocated a quota of 3,000, which is very few compared to other places. The settlement allowance for conscripted men going to war in the future has been set by the Municipal Military Service Association at 4 million yuan per person, which is also higher than in other places. The conscription work in this city is expected to proceed smoothly. Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Garrison Command, is scheduled to host the press on the 16th and representatives from various sectors on the 17th, and issue a proclamation to explain the situation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The conscription quota for the Garrison Command this year has been allocated by order. As for whether additional conscription will occur during this period of general mobilization, there is currently no decision.</p>

<h3>"Mansion" Visit to "Female Judge": Husband is a Young Import-Export Merchant, Matchmaking Caused Unexpected Storm, She Declares She Never Said She Was a "Judge"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At No. 282 Jianli, Jinling East Road, Fujian South Road, there is a mailbox with "Zhu Piye" written on one side and "Huang Fangbai" on the other. Ascending to the third floor, one finds the Min residence of Zhu Huang Fangbai (pictured), the protagonist of the sensational imposter female judge case. In order to investigate the truth of the case, our reporter paid a visit yesterday in the rain.</p>
<p>Walking out to greet us was Huang's husband, Zhu Piye, dressed in a tunic suit and trousers, looking very capable. After inviting us to sit down, Huang Fangbai (reported as Huo Fenbai, actually a mistake) also came out, without makeup, with a furrowed brow, wearing a red and blue patterned silk cheongsam and a pair of blue slippers embroidered with silver flowers. After the reporter explained the purpose of the visit, they told the story from beginning to end:</p>
<p>Zhu Piye is from Fujian and is 29 years old this year. He studied at the Guizhou Daxia University Political Science Department for three years. Huang Fangbai is from Haimen, Jiangsu, and is 25 years old this year. She graduated from the junior high school department of Nanjing Oriental Middle School. In 1940, because Zhu's father died in Shanghai, Zhu rushed from Guiyang to Shanghai to attend the funeral. His father was in the import-export business. Being the eldest son, Zhu inherited his father's business, traveling between Shanghai and Xiamen, buying and selling Chinese and foreign goods for customers. Zhu and Huang married in 1941 and now have three children.</p>
<p>A month ago, He Zhen, a Suzhou native, married a woman introduced by Huang. To thank Huang for the matchmaking, He invited Huang to Qingmeiju for dinner on the 28th of last month. After dinner, He invited Huang to Venus Dance Hall on Madang Road to listen to music. Because He and his wife had other business to attend to, Huang waited alone at Venus, sipping tea. He was mistaken by four dancers at a nearby table, Zhou Jiahua and others, for a dance hostess. They wrote a note requesting a dance. When He Zhen arrived, he questioned Zhou and the others, stating that they should not harass respectable women, which led to a conflict. The Songshan Police Station took them to the station for questioning and reprimanded Zhou and the others, ordering them to sign a bond.</p>
<p>The matter would have been over, but the next day a newspaper published a story that Huang was a female judge, causing a great uproar. According to Huang, she never said she was a "judge" at the police station, which can be checked in the police record. She asked lawyer Li Pu to publish a statement in the newspaper and telegraphed her husband, Zhu Piye, in Xiamen, asking him to return to Shanghai. On the 8th of this month, she suddenly received a summons from the District Procuratorate. She was questioned at the Procuratorate the day before yesterday. To this day, she does not understand why the title of female judge was placed on her head. She said, "I don't know Huang Liang at all. I know Huang Meiping, the female prosecutor at the District Procuratorate, but I have never used her name to boast."</p>
<p>Zhu Piye added a few sentences from the side: "There must be evidence to prove a crime. Where did she say she was a female judge? Who was harmed? Is there an accuser? You can't arbitrarily wrong someone! This matter has had a great impact on my spirit and career. My mother is troubled by this matter and has moved out. We hope that the media will provide fair coverage so that the case can be clarified as soon as possible. For example, some newspapers said that I had served in the military, but in fact, I have been in business since returning to Shanghai from Guiyang and have never served in the military." As for a Xia surname person secretly reporting to the District Procuratorate, he said that he had heard of it, but did not know the person.</p>
<h3>More Than 600 German and Austrian Refugees to Be Repatriated This Month</h3>
<p>The refugee repatriation work, after the formal appointment of Wang Renlin, the former director of the Fisheries Management Office of the Executive Yuan, by relevant authorities, has now formally established the United Nations International Refugee Organization to actively carry out the work. There are a large number of European refugees in China. When the "Marnix" ship sails from Shanghai on the 25th of this month, 650 German and Austrian refugees will be repatriated. These refugees reside in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Shantou and other places in China and have come to Shanghai from different routes. In addition to providing travel assistance to the repatriated refugees, the International Refugee Organization also dispatches nurses and doctors to take care of them on board. The refugees' return to their home countries also requires the permission of the respective governments.</p>
<h3>American Starlet Returns Alive, Anonymous Letter Missing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It has now been proven that the widely rumored suicide in Suzhou of the "American Starlet" Huada was a prank. Our reporter met Huada herself at her residence yesterday and couldn't help but laugh when discussing the past. According to Huada, she returned to Shanghai from Qingdao about two weeks ago. She went to Suzhou this time because she was invited to perform, but due to various reasons, she could not agree. Perhaps someone misunderstood this and played this "joke." As for the anonymous letter sent to Xin Liqin, it has disappeared after being passed around for viewing by many people. Huada said about this: She has been to Xin Liqin twice, hoping to get the original letter so that the handwriting can be verified and the truth can be revealed.</p>

<h3>Yu Shuping's Broadcast: Economic Police Must Possess Profound Knowledge and Integrity to Work Diligently and Maximize Effectiveness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Our newspaper held its fifteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at New Shanghai Radio Station. We invited Yu Shuping, the acting director of the Municipal Police Bureau, to broadcast on "Economic Police." Here is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>Economic police are a coercive power that assists the government in implementing national economic policies and preventing general economic crimes. Economic crimes refer to acts that violate relevant economic control laws and regulations by economic means. Because economic crimes have a criminal nature, they fall under the scope of criminal police, which is fundamentally different from business police, who are specifically responsible for suppressing prohibited activities. The first countries to establish economic police were the German-Austrian alliance during the late World War I. Because German-Austrian ports were blockaded by the Allied fleet, the source of materials was cut off, and the original materials in the country were not enough to be distributed. Jewish merchants, who were accustomed to speculation, took the opportunity to hoard and manipulate, resulting in extreme economic panic. In order to resolve this crisis, the German-Austrian governments established economic police in 1917, specializing in the prevention of economic crimes. Although they were unable to save the economic collapse due to the short time of establishment, the importance of economic police - especially during wartime - cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Weak Concept of National Economy and People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Our Republic of China is a completely free economic country. In order to win the War of Resistance, the government promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during the Emergency Period in October 1938. The purpose was to control the wartime economy. To implement this plan, the government successively established many institutions, such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Materials Bureau, the National General Mobilization Committee, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau, the Ministry of Food, and the price control bureaus, grain transportation bureaus, and production bureaus in various provinces. However, although the government established many of the above-mentioned institutions and was determined to implement economic controls, prices continued to rise. There are many reasons for the rise in prices, but one of the main reasons is that the Chinese people have always been accustomed to living in a free economic society. All production is centered on individual will and aims to make money, and the concept of national economy and people's livelihood is very weak. Currently, in terms of production, except for military factories and yarn factories, other production enterprises cannot be strictly controlled during wartime. Wealthy people can find ways to buy any expensive item, while poor people have difficulty even eating white rice. This situation of unplanned production and uneven distribution still exists today, even after the victory!</p>
<p>Controlling Prices is Essential</p>
<p>As for wartime consumption, all unnecessary waste should be avoided, and everyone should be able to save everything except for the necessities of life so that supply and demand can be balanced. We must consider the war situation and practice strict frugality, but in our country, under a free economic system, the necessary items for the general poverty class cannot be obtained, and at the same time, there are no accurate statistics on the quantity of existing items to use as a basis. It is really a very difficult task to strictly manage during wartime. Because the management of materials is difficult, we have to manage prices. This is a passive method and a last resort. In a planned economy, there is no need to control prices at all, but in a free economy, managing prices is more important because prices are the pivot of production, distribution, and consumption. The rise and fall of prices can stimulate production, regulate distribution, and stretch consumption. In other words, if prices can be controlled, production, distribution, and consumption can be controlled. Therefore, in a free economy, controlling prices is essential.</p>
<p>Analysis of Economic Crimes</p>
<p>The determination of economic crimes, in addition to those clearly stipulated in ordinary criminal law, must also be based on whether they violate relevant economic, financial, and other control laws and regulations. Many were promulgated during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Acts that violate the above-mentioned laws and regulations are either violations of administrative orders or violations of special criminal control laws and regulations. Acts that violate administrative orders are handled by administrative agencies; acts that violate special criminal control laws and regulations are tried by judicial or military judicial agencies. Those who violate Articles 17 and 18 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities or Article 16 of the National General Mobilization Law were originally handled by military judicial agencies, but are now under the jurisdiction of ordinary judicial agencies.</p>
<p>As for acts that violate controls, they include (1) hoarding and speculation, (2) failure to operate in accordance with regulations, (3) speculation and manipulation, (4) evading controls, (5) improper gains, (6) raising prices, wages, or rents, (7) issuing post-dated checks to inflate credit, (8) counterfeiting and adulteration, (9) changing weights and measures, (10) secret competition, (11) tax evasion, (12) clandestine transportation of materials, etc. Regarding the standards for punishing criminal acts, in addition to handling them in accordance with the provisions of the laws and regulations mentioned in the previous section, the local government may also dispose of them according to the actual situation of the event, time, and place. It is precisely because most of the above-mentioned laws and regulations are time-sensitive that many economic acts that were considered illegal and criminal during wartime are irrelevant in peacetime. Since the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures Plan, many wartime economic, financial, and other control laws and regulations have now been strengthened.</p>
<p>Basic Work of Economic Police</p>
<p>Enforcing control laws and preventing acts that violate control laws and regulations is the main task of economic police. However, although criminal acts such as profiteering, fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and malicious bankruptcy have clear provisions in ordinary criminal law, preventing and investigating these criminal acts, because they are carried out by economic means, is also the task of economic police. However, if economic police personnel want to accomplish this task, they must complete the following basic work of economic police: 1. Household registration and statistics. 2. Registration of population and cargo movement. 3. Resource investigation and statistics. 4. Audit of store accounts. 5. Strengthening the organization of labor unions or guilds. 6. Supervision and management of markets, factories, farms, warehouses, companies, money shops, etc.</p>
<p>After completing the above basic work, the economic police can then promote the government's economic control decisions based on joint authority and safeguard the authority of the government's economic control laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Organization and Training of Economic Police</p>
<p>The scope of economic crimes is very wide and the impact is very large. Police personnel responsible for this task must have a higher level of knowledge. In addition to studying law and economics in depth and being familiar with economic geography, they also need to understand common commercial customs and the psychology and behavior of merchants. Therefore, an economic police officer cannot be competent with just a graduation from an ordinary police academy and requires the selection of graduates from agricultural, industrial, commercial, accounting, taxation, economics, and other specialized schools, plus training in investigation techniques, to be competent. If you want to select economic police from the existing police cadre, it is not easy.</p>
<p>In short, economic police are modern police, who need to have profound knowledge, integrity, and capable talents. The task is heavy, and the responsibility is arduous. Whether the national economic order can be stable and whether the government's control laws and regulations can be implemented is greatly related to the good or bad performance of the economic police. In the current stage of severe economic crisis and drastic price fluctuations, economic police should maximize their effectiveness, supervise society to thoroughly implement the emergency economic measures plan, and prevent the occurrence of economic crimes by the people. Only by working hard can they achieve success.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Re-establishes Collection Standards for Public Primary and Secondary School Tuition and Fees for the Next Semester: Secondary School Tuition is 2,000 Yuan, Normal and Primary Schools are Exempt from Collection and Must Not Collect Sanitation Fees, Equipment Fees, etc. Under Any Pretext</h3>

<h3>Ye Guanxiong Played Despite Illness, but Lost to Tao Guanqiu: Hong Kong Tennis Charity Match, Two Heroes from North and South Meet</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Hong Kong] The last game of the Hong Kong Disaster Relief Tennis Charity Tournament, on the 7th, because of Ye Guanxiong's playing despite illness, the battle of the four heroes was held at the Chinese Recreation Club.</p>
<p>First, Xu Weipei and Wang Wenzheng played against each other. "Big Xu" performed excellently, with long shots and short interceptions, making Wang Wenzheng unable to parry. In the first set, Wenzheng lost two games, barely struggling to tie it at 2-2, and was then taken down by "Big Xu" for four games, losing the first set 2-6. At the beginning of the second set, when "Big Xu" led 3-1, Wenhua took a short rest and was in excellent spirits, taking back two games to make it 3-3. However, he lacked stamina and was taken again by "Big Xu" for three games, ending the game 6-3, with Weipei winning two sets. During this game, Wenzheng did his best and struggled in the last game, which was commendable.</p>
<p>The final match was "Little Ye" playing with illness against Tao Guanqiu. Indeed, in these two sets of battle, except for the first three games, "Little Ye" was able to control the battle, and Guanqiu had the upper hand. We can see that Guanqiu's baseline long shots are not easy to overcome, and his ball-out skills are also extremely cunning. If "Little Ye" was as spirited as before, it would be a spectacle to play against each other. In fact, "Little Ye" lost his composure due to lack of energy. His "housekeeping" skills, volleying and intercepting, were self-defeating, with as many as eight shots into the net, and five "dead balls" were served. As a result, Guanqiu lost two sets in a row, the results being 6-3 and 6-2. As for serving "ace" balls, Ye and Xu each hit five, and Tao and Wang each hit two.</p>
<p>Wang and Tao will leave for Shanghai in a few days. In terms of the results, Tao Guanqiu defeated Jiang Daozhang, Xu Weipei, and Ye Guanxiong in singles, which was a great harvest.</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong will go to the United States in the short term, sent by the foreign company he serves. With his skills, he will definitely have unlimited achievements in the future after training in the United States.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Finals Produce an Upset: Green Team Beats Youjia, Post A and B Brothers Clash Tonight</h3>
<p>The 13th episode of the second Table Tennis League Finals was held at the Central Auditorium at 8 pm the night before. The four-part champion Youjia reunited with the runner-up Green Team. It was raining heavily at the time. The referees Chen Jimao and Shen Bohong and the recorder Hu Shansheng all rushed to the scene in the rain and performed their duties on time, with their clothes all wet. They were very enthusiastic. The Green Team was severely injured by Youjia in the four-part finals before. This time, all the soldiers of the team were united against the enemy and fought bravely. Especially in the second and fifth groups, Li Peiran and Li Rongjing of the Green Team relied on their calm minds and saved the remnant in the battle that must be lost, and successively defeated the two generals Li Guanghui and Liu Zaoshi of Youjia, creating victory for the Green Team. Youjia could win but failed to win, which affected the combat psychology. They lost the battle in one group due to insufficient physical strength. As a result, the Green Team received the revenge arrow of Youjia by a score of 4 to 3. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Green Team Youjia Score</p>
<p>Dai Xing Jiang Chunshan 1—3</p>
<p>Li Peiran Li Guangyao 3—1</p>

<p>[United Press London, 12th] British long-distance swimming champion Mr. Brewal, aged 33, who swam across the English Channel in 1937, attempted today to swim from Togatty in Northern Ireland to Portpatrick in Scotland. However, due to the raging waves, he had to give up halfway. Mr. Brewal swam in the icy cold sea for about five hours, covering 11 miles. He was about to swim across one of the most difficult sections of 23 miles to Scotland, but was unable to withstand the impact of the waves and had to come ashore. It is said that he will try again before returning to work on the 18th of this month, in an attempt to be the first person to swim across the North Channel.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Government Has Already Drafted a Sino-Japanese Trade Plan for This Year; It Will Be Implemented After the Two Countries Resume Trade This Autumn</h3>
<p>The Japanese government has drafted a Sino-Japanese trade plan for the 1947 fiscal year, which will be implemented after China and Japan resume trade this autumn. According to sources, the main points of its content are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Japan plans to export to China mainly machinery and equipment (1,080,296,000 Japanese yen, including 30,000 bicycles, 40,000 fans, 100,000 watches, 60,000 cameras, 500 motors, 30,000 spindles of textile machinery, and locomotives, agricultural machinery, and machine tools, etc.); silk-related products (1,684,329,000 yen, including 175,000 boxes of silkworm eggs and 9,800 bales of rayon); groceries (683,736,000 yen), etc. The second largest category is silk products, ceramics, rubber, pharmaceuticals, glass products, chemical products, paper, wood, and agricultural and aquatic products, totaling 4,964,365,000 yen, equivalent to more than 99.28 million US dollars.</p>
<p>(B) It plans to import from China 600,000 metric tons of salt, 360,000 metric tons of sugar, 370,000 metric tons of soybeans, 180,000 metric tons of soybean cake, 900,000 metric tons of coal, 400,000 catties of animal hair, and medicinal materials (450,000 catties of cork bark, 440,000 catties of licorice, 340,000 catties of seaweed, 60,000 catties of honey, 30,000 catties of Poria cocos, etc.), totaling 2,384,092,000 yen (excluding medicinal materials, because there is no fixed price in the international market), equivalent to more than 47.68 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Still Trying to Dump Inferior Goods</p>
<p>Qualified persons commented on the Japanese government's planned Sino-Japanese trade plan for this year on the 13th, believing that Japan is still trying to dump cheap and inferior goods to China. According to the plan, Japan wants to obtain a trade surplus of more than 51.6 million US dollars from China in the three and a half months from August 15, when it resumes foreign trade, to the end of the year, which deserves our attention. Although judging from the high-quality goods that Japan plans to export to China, certain categories of goods will be difficult for our government to approve for import, and whether our country can supply the goods it plans to purchase from us, such as coal and soybeans, will depend on the situation at that time. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the extent to which this plan can be realized. However, we should be warned that although Japan was defeated, its industrial production capacity is still considerable. If it dumps a large number of cheap goods to our country, it will become a fatal blow to our national industry, and our government must devise countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Profit Tax Inspection Begins; Schedule for Hardware and Other Industries Has Been Set</h3>
<p>The auditing and taxation work of the income tax for the first category of profit-making enterprises in this city in the 36th year was once slowed down due to issues such as the burden on industry and commerce and the discipline of auditing. Later, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce went to Beijing and earnestly suggested a simplified standard method to the central government. Mr. Xu Baiyuan, the Director of Finance, and Mr. Wang Fuzhou, the Director of the Direct Taxation Department, repeatedly came to Shanghai to investigate the truth and decided to change to a sampling inspection system. At the end of last week, the account books of 133 households in the hardware, import and export, woolen cloth, paper, and paint industries were inspected, and it is expected to be completed this week. Then, other industries will be sampled and inspected one after another.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are more than 2,000 tax-reporting units in these five industries. About 500 households have already been audited, so this time only those with annual turnover of more than 400 million are sampled, as mentioned above. The secondary audit standard profit rate will be used as the tax standard for the entire industry. Compared with the previous method, about 1,000 households are exempted from inspection. If the work goes smoothly, other industries will be inspected. Officials have stated that it must be completed within two or three months.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has requested the authorities: (1) to value the habits of the business community when handling old accounts and allowing write-offs, and to be as lenient as possible. (2) The profit tax on deposit (i.e., interbank lending) interest should be borne by the borrower. (3) When inspecting account books, please allow representatives from the relevant trade associations and the Chamber of Commerce to participate in the inspection. The authorities have expressed their acceptance. At the end of last week, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce also made the above requests to the tax bureau, and requested that when the results of the previous audit are adopted as the tax standard for each industry, a public announcement should be made and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce should be given the opportunity to review it. In recent days, various industry associations have attached great importance to the tax bureau's reopening of the auditing work. However, whether the sentiment can be stabilized depends on the results of the five industry audits. According to qualified observers, the sampling inspection of the five industries should be free of friction. Especially for the woolen cloth and paint industries, more than 260 households have been inspected, and only about 20 households remain to be inspected, so there should be no problems. However, it is necessary for both officials and businesses to be calm and rational in their judgment. Related parties revealed that the scheduled dates for submitting account books for inspection within this week for the five industries are: woolen cloth on Monday, hardware on Tuesday, paper on Wednesday, import and export on Thursday, and paint on Friday. The bureau is also supplementing personnel and responding seriously.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Improves Cocoon Goods; Begins Dry Cocoon Pledge Loan</h3>
<p>The cocoon loan procedures implemented by the China Farmers Bank, according to the contract signed with the silk merchants in the past, only had one provision: the amount of the loan applied for and the method of repayment at the end, either by paying money or paying silk, was at the borrower's convenience. This year, the China Farmers Bank, in view of the fact that the fresh cocoon loan center is concentrated in Shanghai, while the factories are in the Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, and it is quite difficult for the Shanghai office to manage during the dry cocoon period, has changed the procedure to be handled by the local branches. Therefore, this year's Farmers Bank cocoon loan stipulates that the fresh cocoon part is still in Shanghai, while the dry cocoon pledge is handled by the branches.</p>
<p>It is also learned that, in order to help factories start work as soon as possible, before the fresh cocoon accounts are completely closed, the dry cocoons that have been put into storage can be contracted with the local Farmers Bank branches to start work first. As of now, it has already started to be handled, and the total amount is still allocated from the total loan amount of 270 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Association to Purchase Raw Silk in Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces</h3>
<p>Regarding the purchase and sale of spring and autumn raw silk in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year, the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics is actively promoting it. According to the output of raw silk in Sichuan and Guangdong, the number is also not small. It is learned that the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Commission has noticed this and decided in the program for foreign sales of raw silk discussed at the 15th meeting of the association that the purchase and promotion of raw silk in the Sichuan and Guangdong regions should be handled in accordance with the Shanghai raw silk method. Ge Jingzhong and Chen Xianzhang are requested to prepare a detailed plan and submit it to the association's "Silk and Silk Products Subgroup" for approval, and then submit it to the Executive Committee for discussion. It is also learned that this notice was sent separately at the end of last week, and the preliminary plan is expected to be completed within this week.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Financial Institutions in Provinces and Cities Across the Country</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the statistics released by the Audit Office of the Central Bank: As of May 31 this year, there are a total of 5,141 financial institutions in provinces and cities across the country, including 2,100 head offices and 3,041 branches. In terms of banks, state-owned account for 778 units, provincial-owned account for 988 units, county and city-owned account for 382 units, commercial-owned account for 991 units, silver firms account for 583 units, money shops account for 527 units, trust companies account for 28 units, insurance companies account for 529 units, cooperative credit unions account for 10 units, and county and city-owned account for 325 units.</p>
<p>Among the provinces and cities, Sichuan has the largest number of financial institutions, with 629 units, followed by Zhejiang, with 440 units. Shanghai is third, with 394 units. Qinghai and Rehe have the fewest, with 3 units each. Chahar has only 4 units.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market situation: The market opened weakly. It was heard that Wing Tai Wo still had a large number of shipments before the tax increase, and foreign counterparts also distributed goods. The market's sentiment suddenly became weak, and buyers waited and watched. In addition, the money market was tight, and selling occurred frequently. Finally, in a tentative selling situation, 10-cigarette packs of British American Tobacco (BAT) fell by more than 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to more than 8.8 million yuan. Old Knife also fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, to 7.75 million yuan. Transactions in the market were very rare.</p>
<p>The prices of other Chinese cigarettes also fell, and American carton cigarettes and 50-cigarette packs were also sluggish. After the close, it was heard that BAT cigarettes were quoted at 8.85 million yuan, but there were few buyers. 20-cigarette packs were sold at 40,500 yuan per pack, Beautiful cigarettes at 52,600 yuan, Brandy cigarettes at 34,000 yuan, Double Axe cigarettes at 26,700 yuan, and Old Knife cigarettes at 7.75 million yuan per carton. There were only sellers and no buyers.</p>
<h3>Affected by Lack of Raw Materials, the Rubber Industry Faces Crisis; Some Factories in the City Have Partially Suspended Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Rubber Industry Association, the rubber industry is now facing difficulties due to a lack of raw materials. From February to April this year, the rubber import quota was 560,000 US dollars, which could import about 1,000 tons of raw rubber. However, the actual need in Shanghai is about 2,000 tons per month. The usual shortfall is supplemented by entrepot trade between Hong Kong and South China. However, since July, this type of entrepot trade has also been prohibited, so the rubber industry is facing a crisis of insufficient raw materials. Some factories in the city have partially suspended work. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can pay attention to this.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the past six months, the price of raw materials used by the rubber industry has increased by more than five times, but the price of finished products has only increased by about one time, which is disproportionate. Moreover, due to the expansion of the civil war, the sales markets in Northeast and North China have shrunk, and the purchasing power of rural areas has declined. All these factors make it difficult for the rubber industry to maintain its operations. The previous rumor that Dunlop tires planned to dump products in China would not become a reality due to foreign exchange and import controls. In fact, China can already supply bicycles and tricycle tires. Large and medium-sized rubber factories can also manufacture car tires. At the same time, Shenyang, Qingdao, and Taiwan have received large-scale car tire factories, but unfortunately, due to various reasons, they are currently in a state of semi-shutdown. If they can all start work in the future, car tires can also be self-sufficient, and there is no need to rely on foreign goods.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Carpet Industry's Foreign Sales Gradually Improve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The carpet industry in Tianjin, which is on the verge of extinction, has now gained a glimmer of life due to the gradual improvement of foreign sales. Some foreign and Chinese merchants in Tianjin are exporting carpets in large quantities. During its heyday, there were 200 to 300 carpet factories in Tianjin. During World War II, they withered away one after another. Today, there are only 8,000 factories left. The main raw material is wool from the Northwest, so the cost is too high, which has become the biggest obstacle to promoting sales. In addition, Japan once sent female workers to China to learn carpet weaving techniques. Currently, carpets made in Japan are being shipped to the US market, and Turkey and Vietnam also produce carpets, forming a competitive situation overseas. All of this should be a concern for our carpet industry, and efforts need to be made to overcome it.</p>
<h3>Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Hosts Banquet for Textile Adjustment Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Minister Chen Qitian of the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted a banquet for the members of the Textile Adjustment Committee at around 7:00 PM last night. Mayor Wu was also invited to attend. Minister Chen talked about the government's promulgation of the mobilization order and the need for the yarn and cloth adjustment policies to be effectively coordinated. He then exchanged ideas with the attending members and the meeting was adjourned. Chen left for Beijing on the night train yesterday.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Show Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's prices of daily necessities on the market showed a decline. Few people in the industry arrived due to the rain, and transactions were also light. The opening prices showed a slight decline. Huang Xiangmao soap fell by 2,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 338,000 yuan. The market was even weaker after the close. It was heard that a large household offered 333,000 yuan, with a large amount of selling, but there were few buyers. In addition, Gu Ben, Jian Dao, Li Niu, and other brands of soap also fell by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The match market was also sluggish, but candles showed strength.</p>
<p>Raw Materials for Soap and Candles, Caustic Soda Step Up</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for caustic soda, the raw material for soap and candles, was stable because the digestion of goods from all parties was very smooth, and the current inventory in the market was not sufficient. Yue Pai caustic soda rose to 13.5 million per barrel, continuing to rise by 50,000 yuan compared with the previous day. US caustic soda also rose by 400,000 yuan, to 13.2 million yuan. US-made Siling's multiple sales, with each dan rapidly declining by 1 million yuan, to 5 million yuan. N rosin was 750,000 per can, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Highly refined paraffin wax also fell by 150,000 yuan per dan, to 1.65 million yuan, but coconut oil was still 1.9 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Investigates the Overview of the Cosmetics Industry; Proposes Five Points That Should Be Improved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to statistics from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 129 members of the Cosmetics Industry Association in the city. The production equipment and technical level vary greatly among the companies, and the range of products is even more scattered. After investigation by the Guidance Office, it is believed that the following points need to be improved:</p>
<p>(1) The products of the cosmetics industry are mainly daily necessities such as toothpaste, soap, mosquito coils, cologne, talcum powder, and skin moisturizers. Other products such as face powder, rouge, lipstick, and eyebrow pencils have a narrower range of production and sales. Therefore, cosmetics are not purely a luxury goods industry. It seems that the name should be changed to daily cosmetics industry to avoid misunderstanding by the general public.</p>
<p>(2) Many types of face powder are made with lead powder (lead carbonate) as the raw material. Lead agents are harmful to the skin, and the health authorities should inspect and ban them. The factories in this industry should especially cherish themselves and refrain from using this raw material, and replace it with zinc white, titanium white, and zinc fatty acid.</p>
<p>(3) Toothpaste metal tubes contain a variety of metals such as tin, zinc, and lead. Among them, green lead is soft and cheap. Manufacturers use green lead to greedily seek high profits, making the manufacturing of soft tubes substandard. Toothpaste adhering to lead is harmful to health. The health authorities should follow the example of food and drug examples, to chemically test it. Those that do not meet health standards should be prohibited, and those that meet the standards should be given a certificate, so that purchasers have a choice.</p>
<p>(4) Stearic acid produced by Sino-French Grease Factory and glycerin produced by Wuzhou Joint Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, and Daxin Chemical Factory can all meet the standards and can be used to promote domestic products.</p>
<p>(5) The soap manufacturing equipment left by the enemy and puppet Five Star Soap Factory and Mei Hua Soap Factory is very complete. The Five Star Soap Factory has two sets of fully continuous automatic equipment for cutting, drying, harmonizing, grinding, rolling, and printing soap bases. Mei Hua has one set of this type of equipment and two 125-ton soap pots, with a potentially large output. Unfortunately, there is no glycerin by-product equipment. As the business of taking over the business has not been promoted for a long time, the receivers are working hard to promote mass production.</p>
<h3>General Meeting of Bank Members; Sets Date for Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 14th General Meeting of Members of the Shanghai Bank Commercial Association has been scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

<h3>Sulfur Allocation; Principles Determined by the Export Control Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Export Control Committee's quota for the second quarter (May to July) of input limit, the allocation of the sulfur item, there are disputes. The industrial sector argued for more raw materials to meet industrial needs. The business community argues for more finished goods to meet general requirements of different views, opinions are also different. After the allocation office convened a discussion committee, both sides expressed their views, which were reasonable. Finally, a fair decision was made: 55% of the quota was allocated to raw materials and 45% was allocated to finished products, which was handled separately by industrial users and importers.</p>

<h3>Fuxin and Five Other Flour Mills To Fully Produce for the Government Authorities Stipulate Individual Applications for Wheat Purchases</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has allocated 300 billion yuan to entrust five major flour mills, including Fuxin and Fufeng, to grind flour. According to relevant sources, this substitute grinding method entails the joint handling of all procedures, from purchasing wheat to grinding it into flour, by the five mills. The Ministry of Food only purchases all the finished products at the production cost plus legitimate profit to meet the needs of public consumption. The participating mills will focus on production for the government and will no longer purchase wheat for their own grinding purposes. However, the authorities are still willing to assist in the application for wheat loans from the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, and it has been stipulated that each flour mill can individually apply to the Joint Treasury.</p>

<h3>The Graves of Thirty Thousand Communist Soldiers: A Record of Cremating Corpses in Siping</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao, Shenyang Air Report</p>
<p>Suddenly, an odor of burning and decay invaded my nostrils. Looking down, Siping was spread out beneath the aircraft's wings.</p>
<p>Flying low, alongside the railway line, countless piles of soybeans were burning, wisps of green smoke rising. The lower we descended, the more intense the smoke became.</p>
<p>We landed at the airport in the western suburbs of Siping. Many buildings and facilities were severely damaged during the two occupations by the Communist forces. Besides that, several wrecked aircraft lay there. What remained intact were the runway and an aircraft hangar.</p>
<p>The Tiexi Area</p>
<p>Heading towards the city, we passed through earthen walls riddled with fortifications. On Zhongshan West Road, the orderly rows of houses were pockmarked with holes from artillery shells and bombs. This was a section of the famous Tiexi district battlefield, where the Nationalists initially held their ground, facing the Communist artillery barrage, and later, after the Communist forces invaded, it was bombed by the Air Force.</p>
<p>The Electricity Bureau in Ashes</p>
<p>A company of Nationalist soldiers in the Electricity Bureau were completely wiped out after the Communist forces set fire to the building from below and threw yellow explosives. The Communist forces first seized the lower floors, and the Nationalist soldiers gradually retreated to the upper floors, the second and third floors, putting up resistance step by step. Injured and killed, they ultimately perished in the flames!</p>
<p>In front of the Electricity Bureau lay countless corpses of Communist soldiers that could not be moved, and dead warhorses. Some were reddish-brown and swollen, others were crushed, leaving only empty black shells, lying crisscrossed in pools of blood and melted fat, swarming with green-headed flies.</p>
<p>White Bones in the Square</p>
<p>Turning south from here, we detoured towards the southwest corner, which was the Siping Square. The Provincial Government, the Municipal Government, and the Qiqihar Railway Bureau were all located there. This area was even more tragic. At the foot of the steps in front of the Municipal Government, there was a pile of corpses, one or two lying on their backs, exposing white ribs.</p>
<p>In the northeast corner of the square was the core Nationalist stronghold, a school that General Chen Mingren and his troops planned to defend to the death. The surrounding fortifications were constructed very firmly and meticulously.</p>
<p>Yellow Explosives</p>
<p>The Communist forces relied entirely on the explosive power of yellow explosives to capture this position. Most of the explosives were delivered to the openings of the bunkers. In front of the bunkers, we saw the remains of Communist soldiers, some covered in dog skin, others wrapped in cotton quilts. This was to facilitate rolling towards the bunkers. There were still remnants of rectangular yellow explosive packages with a hand grenade tied to the top and attached to a wooden stick, left there.</p>
<p>The surroundings of the square were filled with broken walls and ruins, a scene of desolation. Only rows of trees, lush and verdant, displayed signs of life in the setting sun. Apart from that, everything was deathly still.</p>
<p>Soybeans Burning</p>
<p>The overpass was the connecting point between Tiexi and Tiedong. On the raised bridge, defensive works were built using sacks of soybeans. Piles of soybeans were burning south of the bridge, the smoke stinging everyone's eyes and mouths. Gunshots crackled overhead, accompanied by rumbling explosions. Smoke, fire, and gunfire merged into one, creating an extremely tense scene.</p>
<p>East of the railway, warehouses were piled with soybeans and miscellaneous grains, estimated to be over 100,000 tons. These golden northeastern products, rich in oil and with large grains, were left to burn,无人施救。During my two days in Siping, I felt pained by this.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Tiedong</p>
<p>Crossing the overpass and stepping onto Zhongshan East Road, the ground was scattered with soybeans. All defensive works were also built using sacks of soybeans. Besides that, there were obstacles made of tables, chairs, beds, benches, and other furniture. These were obstacles that the Nationalist army set up when they retreated to the Tiedong area, fearing that the Communist army would rush across the overpass.</p>
<p>In the Tiedong area, every street and every building was surrounded by pits and wooden stakes; barbed wire and wooden fences were everywhere. It was as if I had seen the "plum blossom pile," "tripping rope," and "entrances," from novels. This told people that the Nationalist army was "advancing step by step, building defenses in every house," determined to fight to the death here.</p>
<p>Newspapers had reported that the Communist forces broke into Siping's Tiedong district from the southern suburbs, reaching the water source and the Catholic Church. Indeed, the last Nationalist stronghold in Siping, the site of the fierce fighting to the death in Tiedong, was in this area.</p>
<p>When this reporter walked into South First, Second, and Third Latitude Roads and South First, Second, Third, and Fourth Main Roads, what I saw were bullets, hand grenades, yellow explosive packages, cotton, clothes, shoes, corpses, and destruction!</p>
<p>A street called "Chongqing Street" was the site of even more unprecedentedly fierce combat. Nationalist and Communist forces were separated by a single wall, throwing hand grenades at each other. The Communist forces dug tunnels to bomb the Nationalist forces, and the Nationalist forces defended to the death.</p>
<p>When a workshop or house collapsed, it was immediately repaired, sometimes even incorporating corpses. In front of the bunkers were corpses, and corpses in the corners of walls and in front of doors. Both sides were red-eyed at the time.</p>
<h3>An Old Woman Tragically Shot, Fell into a Cellar But Miraculously Survived</h3>
<p>An old woman, with white cloth stained with blood wrapped around her front and back, squatted in a pile of tiles. I asked her, "What happened?" She said, "One night, the Nationalist and Communist forces were fighting fiercely. We lay prostrate on the ground. Later, the Nationalist forces retreated from our courtyard, but the Communist forces were still firing guns and throwing hand grenades. I and another old woman crawled out, shouting, 'These are all civilians, don't shoot!' Before we could finish speaking, a shot rang out, hitting me in the chest, followed by another shot in the back. I stumbled into the cellar and lost consciousness. I can't believe I'm still alive now!"</p>
<p>Crawling Out of the Cellar</p>
<p>The Tiexi district of Siping has been reduced to a rubble field. The southern corner of the Tiedong district is in a similar situation. The northern and eastern parts are mostly able to maintain their original state. At the same time, there are more residents here, but many houses have been hit by Communist artillery fire.</p>
<p>These people crawled out of their cellars and began to work to survive. The refugees also returned from all directions, supporting the old and leading the young. Many were homeless, and their means of livelihood were gone. Their faces were filled with sorrow, and they were extremely miserable!</p>
<p>A Hand Reaching Out for Help</p>
<p>The Northeast Headquarters urgently allocated 30 million yuan for disaster relief in the Northeast and advanced 50 million yuan in circulating currency. Liu Handong, the chairman of Liaobei Province, has extended a hand for help, appealing for national assistance. He said with a heavy heart, "Post-war reconstruction is difficult. Leaving aside the military, the casualties among the people and public educators in Siping are at least ten thousand. Nine-tenths of the city's houses have been destroyed by artillery fire, and 100,000 tons of grain have been lost. At the same time, 50,000 people have no food. Siping's reconstruction will not be accomplished in four or five decades!"</p>
<h3>The Puppet Manchukuo's Saito Commander Serves as a Communist Artillery Officer</h3>
<p>During the bloody battle of Siping, the Communist forces mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops. After May 20th, they formed a siege around Siping, actively launching battles to isolate the city. With the worries about the rear eliminated, they began the siege of Siping on June 11th.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers unanimously said, "This time, the Communist artillery fire was too fierce and too accurate. As soon as a tree was shot down, the artillery fire would begin. First, they would fire on the entire area, creating disruptive fire, then they would fire on the front line, the first line, the second line... Finally, they would fire on specific points, hitting each point accurately!"</p>
<p>Someone from the military headquarters said, "At night, standing on high ground and observing, we estimated that the Communist forces had more than seventy or eighty large-caliber guns, plus mortars, totaling more than two hundred. Later, we learned that there were many Japanese technical personnel among them. At the same time, most importantly, Saito, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Siping during the former puppet Manchukuo regime, was serving as the artillery commander."</p>
<p>"They used new-style aiming guns. Wherever the gun pointed, the artillery would fire there. We captured a Korean who was waving the aiming gun, but we couldn't get a detailed interrogation." When that Korean was brought before the reporter, he was pale and reportedly very ill, so we couldn't learn the details. There was also a Communist soldier who claimed to be from Harbin, but was pointed out as a Korean. The Korean admitted it.</p>
<p>Thirty Thousand Casualties</p>
<p>The Nationalist army had six divisions. The 88th Division fought in Tiexi, led by Peng, using new recruits. Four and a half battalions of the 54th Division fought with the Communist forces in the southern Tiedong district. The 87th Division, led by Xiong Xinmin, defended the northeastern area, with intact positions. In particular, the defense of the Taipingling Heights in the northern suburbs was the most meritorious. According to statistics, the Communist forces suffered 30,000 casualties, and the Nationalist army also suffered extremely heavy losses. Until June 30th, the Nationalist forces in Siping joined forces.</p>
<p>When the reporter left Siping and was over the city, the smell of burning corpses was even stronger because Siping was in the process of cremating bodies. Looking down at Siping, it was shrouded in the smoke of burning soybeans.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Deliberations on the Demarcation of the New Provincial Boundary of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>— Chen Yada</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of China's provinces and regions, we believe that there is no need for large-scale or comprehensive changes, but rather advocate for making partial adjustments to some necessary areas. Recently, the government decided to establish an administrative region on Hainan Island and simultaneously began preparing for provincial affairs. This is a timely measure by the government regarding the reorganization of provinces and regions. If China's provinces and regions can be reorganized in this way according to actual needs, then the reorganization work will be much easier and simpler. The long-standing debate over the demarcation of provinces can also obtain a proper solution through this.</p>
<p>However, how should the territory and boundaries of the new province region on Hainan Island be divided and handled? This is worth discussing here while the province region has not yet been formally established. The government's designation of Hainan Island to establish administrative regions is a step that should be taken in the process of establishing a province. When the establishment of the province is implemented in the future, its scope may not be limited to this single island. Before implementing the new system, the government will surely conduct thorough consideration and rational demarcation of the new province's territory based on various objective conditions.</p>
<p>From a geographical point of view, we feel that Hainan Island and the mainland across from it, namely the Leizhou Peninsula (equivalent to the old Leizhou Prefecture) and southwestern Guangdong (roughly equivalent to Gaozhou Prefecture, Lianzhou Prefecture, and Qinzhou), are closely related and inseparable. However, this part is far away from the main part of Guangdong, forming an isolated and separated situation. Therefore, it seems very appropriate and convenient to include it in the new province region of Hainan Island in terms of administration.</p>
<p>The Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island are separated only by the Qiongzhou Strait, which is 18 kilometers wide (the distance between Paiwei Cape southeast of Haian and the beach northeast of Haikou). The terrain of the two sides is so closely connected that Hainan Island was quickly discovered by the people who first migrated to the Xuwen Peninsula (the southern end of Leizhou Peninsula) during the Qin and Han dynasties. Before that, the Li people of the Miao Yao ethnic group crossed the peninsula from the mainland, relying on the strait that could be navigated by a single reed to reach the island - these Li people are still the main indigenous residents of the island. From this, the closeness of the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island can be known, as well as their long-standing interdependent relationship.</p>
<p>Topographically, this strait has not formed a true barrier. Because the Leizhou Peninsula and northern Hainan Island belong to the same terrain, namely the so-called Leizhou-Hainan Plain. The Leizhou Peninsula is a gently undulating plain, almost directly connected to the northern plain of Hainan Island through narrow waterways. Since the terrain is so similar and unified (there are also many similarities in geology between the two sides, which will not be elaborated on here), it is naturally difficult to separate personnel and politics.</p>
<p>Through the Leizhou Peninsula, the territory of the new province region extends further into southwestern Guangdong, namely the regions of the old Gaozhou, Lianzhou, and Qinzhou. Only by connecting Hainan Island and southwestern Guangdong can the combined effect of the sea and land be achieved. The Leizhou Peninsula is the link between the two places, possessing the nature of a central land bridge.</p>
<p>Now, to encompass the old Leizhou Prefecture, which generally covers the Leizhou Peninsula, and the three regions of the old Gaozhou Prefecture, Lianzhou Prefecture, and Qinzhou in southwestern Guangdong, we collectively refer to them as the "Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area."</p>
<p>This area and Hainan Island should be united into one province region for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The northern boundary of "Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian" is lined with a group of mountains that have been eroded for a long time, among which the more prominent are the Gou Lou Mountains (south of Luoding) and the Shiwan Mountains on the western border. Relying on these mountains, it is separated from the Xijiang Basin, forming another coastal slope outside the Xijiang River Basin. This is opposite to the northern slope of Hainan Island, with a tendency to echo and unite. The mountain watershed is roughly consistent with the northern boundary of Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian, and for the sake of convenient demarcation, the northern boundary of Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian (political boundary) can be regarded as the northern boundary of the new province region. (The northern boundary mentioned here refers to the land boundary starting from west of Lianjiang and ending at the junction of Fangcheng and Annam, actually including a very small part of the eastern and western boundaries.)</p>
<p>(2) Climatically, southwestern Guangdong is also different from other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi, being located in a purely tropical zone with a maritime character. This is the same type as Hainan Island.</p>
<p>(3) The coastal part of this area is a comprehensive body of land and sea composed of islands, peninsulas, capes, and inland seas. This is the same as Hainan Island, giving residents the convenience of maritime activities.</p>
<p>(4) The tropical nature of this area and Hainan Island is more pronounced than in other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi; therefore, the agricultural situation also shows differences. Moreover, due to the sparse population and the abundance of various mineral deposits, both regions are rich in development characteristics.</p>
<p>(5) Except for the coastal plain around the island and the relatively flat northern third, Hainan Island generally belongs to mountainous areas covered with bushes (the lack of alluvial lowlands is a characteristic of most islands). Therefore, it is necessary to add the adjustment of the mainland plains on the opposite shore to have sufficient hope for prosperity. In this way, Hainan Island relies on the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area, and at the same time, the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area also needs Hainan Island to show its effectiveness. In general, a coastal area needs to have more contact with the sea and arouse residents' interest in the sea, so the so-called "Off-Shore Island" is indispensable. In the past, this place hidden in the southwest corner, with such a large "Off-Shore Island" as Hainan Island, it is not difficult to enhance the importance of this area and the nearby coast.</p>
<p>The prominent human geographer Ellen, C. Semple, when discussing islands, pays special attention to the concept of "Political Detachability of Islands." The general idea is that islands are geographically isolated areas and are politically easy to separate. In order to avoid this defect, politically, it must be combined with the mainland so that it has a centripetal movement towards the mainland; according to this rule, Hainan Island and southwestern Guangdong can also be made into an administrative unit.</p>
<p>To constitute the new province region of Hainan Island, in addition to the above two parts, the Xisha and Nansha Islands in the South China Sea should also be included. Geographically, the two island groups are closer to this area than to Guangdong; this division is needed not only in terms of administrative rule, but also in terms of geography and geopolitics.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the new province region includes Hainan Island, the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area, and the Xisha and Nansha Islands. It has Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, Lingao, 定安, Ya, Ganen, Changjiang, Wanning, Lingshui, Baisha, Ledong, Baoting, and Ding'an (all on Hainan Island), Maoming, Xinyi, Huazhou, Lianjiang, Dianbai, Wuchuan (all in the old Gaozhou Prefecture), Suixi, Haikang, Xuwen (all in the old Leizhou Prefecture), Qin, Fangcheng (all in the old Qinzhou), Hepu, and Lingshan (all in the old Lianzhou Prefecture) counties and Guangzhou Bay administrative region. Its provincial capital can be set up in Qiongshan on Hainan Island, the main brain of the new province. (The Dongsha Islands still belong to Guangdong).</p>
<p>At the northern and southern ends of China's 4,000-mile arc-shaped coastline, there is a similar pattern of land-sea intersection (both ends have peninsulas, islands, straits, bays, capes, inland seas, etc.). However, the northern end has long been a stage in Chinese history that has played many moving dramas; while the southern end has been so deserted that it has almost been forgotten. In order to promote the country's attention to the southern border (according to today's Pacific geographical situation, the importance of the southern end is not less than that of the northern end). The establishment of this southernmost province region is a matter of profound significance.</p>
<p>Domestic commentators often believe that the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area is too far from the provincial capital, and it seems appropriate to change its affiliation to Guangxi to emphasize national defense, so that Guangxi can also have an outlet to the sea. The British geographer L.W. Lyde also believes that the eastern and western ends of Guangdong, namely the Han River basin and southwestern Guangdong (including Hainan Island), should belong to Fujian and Guangxi respectively. But in our view, it is better for southwestern Guangdong and Hainan Island to form a new province region. For the same reason, the Han River basin along with southwestern Fujian can be merged into the Taiwan province region. This division seems more suitable and appropriate.</p>
<p>In short, our view on the demarcation of provinces and regions is to agree with the partial reorganization of Hainan Island in this way. We do not advocate completely overturning or ignoring the inherent boundaries and reforming them. Recently, the authorities of the Ministry of Land Administration plan to follow the example of the American states and use latitude and longitude lines to divide the provincial boundaries (see Minister Li Jingzhai's talk in the Shanghai News on June 12 of this year). From various aspects, this design is really impossible to apply to China. Because in Eurasia, countries with a long-standing culture—especially China, which has a long history—its political boundaries are always curvilinear patterns formed by long-term vicissitudes (using latitude and longitude lines very rarely). As for latitude and longitude degrees and grid-shaped boundaries, they are often used in newly discovered and newly developed lands (such as the Americas, Australia, and the Philippines), which has almost become a very common rule on boundary demarcation. What's more, latitude and longitude lines are not an ideal boundary, and there are many shortcomings in themselves.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Special Issue Editor: Yu Bing First Issue Edited by the Business Department of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</p>
<h3>Inaugural Statement</h3>
<p>— Yu Bingjian</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a state-run transportation enterprise and the main tool for public communication. After the restoration, the telecommunications industry is making efforts to build up its infrastructure. The Bureau recognizes the daily needs of telecommunications for the public and the development of the telecommunications industry also depends on the joint efforts and assistance of the people. Therefore, at the beginning of the construction, the Bureau aims to serve the public and wants to be one with the people.</p>
<p>The publication of this journal follows this principle, and its motivations can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To make public telecommunications technology and business for public exploration.</p>
<p>(2) To report telecommunications common knowledge and introduce emerging businesses for adoption.</p>
<p>(3) To solicit suggestions and evaluations for the Bureau's future reform and innovation.</p>
<p>(4) To answer user queries.</p>
<p>This journal is an open forum. It is hoped that domestic talents and advanced telecommunications professionals will not hesitate to contribute valuable articles as a compass for the Bureau. In this way, the progress of the telecommunications business in the future will be attributed to the contributions of distinguished scholars. The publication of this journal today has profound significance.</p>
<h3>Before and After the Restoration of International Calls</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhengda</p>
<p>When victory arrived, the highest telecommunications authorities immediately began planning for the restoration of international calls. Last year, they began recruiting and training international operators, and preparing international call regulations, business rules, operator terminology, and other preparatory work. However, due to environmental limitations and the lack of agreement between China and the United States, international telephone service was delayed until March of this year. The General Directorate reached an agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). At the same time, the General Directorate, together with the International Radio Station, began preparing to install a two-way single-sideband wireless telephone (2KW). In the original domestic long-distance station of the General Directorate, an international call exchange room was set up, equipped with switchboards and soundproofing equipment. In May of this year, the work was completed and trial calls began.</p>
<p>Initially, meeting times were set for 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM. After several trial calls, it was found that daytime communication was difficult due to strong interference, while nighttime communication was clear and good. Therefore, it was decided that from July 1st of this year, the service would be officially opened, with the time temporarily set from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM (Shanghai summer time). In China, the opening locations were temporarily set as Beijing and Shanghai, and the United States could reach all parts of the country.</p>
<p>The anticipated "July 1st" finally arrived. The staff of the General Directorate and the International Radio Station spent the day with excitement and anticipation. The opening ceremony planned by the Telecommunications General Directorate was to have Shanghai Mayor Wu first speak with the Mayor of San Francisco and the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun. Subsequently, Director Yu of the General Directorate and Chief Engineer Zong of the International Radio Station would speak with representatives of AT&amp;T, mutually wishing success.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 1st, the organizers were busy and sweating profusely. From the Director down, everyone was working hard, arranging the auditorium, installing loudspeakers, and colleagues from the Central Film Studio came to the bureau to assist in filming news footage. Around 9:00 PM, the invited news reporters and guests arrived one after another, and the receptionists became active. Around 10:00 PM, Mayor Wu and his wife arrived and were led by the Director to the Director's office for a brief rest. Then, the ceremony began in a solemn atmosphere. In the center of the venue, the national flags of China and the United States were hung, and fragrant and beautiful flowers were displayed on the table, symbolizing the friendly relations and bright future between the two countries. The hostess, with a clear voice, opened the ceremony.</p>
<p>First, Director Yu gave a speech in Chinese and English to the Mayor and guests. At that moment, flashes of mercury lamps and the sound of "cameras" were incessant. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech. The Mayor's elegant and democratic demeanor, smile, and conversation deeply comforted the people who had worked all day. At this time, the first international telephone call after restoration began to be transmitted from Shanghai to San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean. The loudspeakers transmitted the voices of both sides, and what was gratifying was that the voice was as clear as a local telephone call. When the Mayor spoke with Ambassador Gu, the Ambassador highly praised the communication of international calls. According to the scheduled program, after the call, a business film of the General Directorate was played, and refreshments were served. This historic ceremony was completed in a friendly and happy atmosphere. The restoration of international calls can increase the friendship between China and the United States, and at the same time, it proves the power of human science to overcome the natural environment. It can make people on both sides of the Pacific Ocean feel as if they are together, talking intimately. The progress of science has further reduced the scope of the universe.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, ten days have passed since the international calls were restored. Only one of the two circuits originally scheduled to open simultaneously could not be used due to interference from a radio station in San Francisco. Negotiations are currently underway with the other party to change the frequency. Recently, the demand for Sino-US telephone calls has been increasing daily, resulting in a large gap between supply and demand, and it has been necessary to temporarily stop registration in order to clear the registered calls. This is, of course, very regrettable. Regarding this point, we will strive to improve the equipment of the line in the future to achieve the purpose of smooth Sino-US telephone communication.</p>
<h3>General Overview of the Telecommunications Business of This Bureau</h3>
<p>— Li Tong</p>
<p>Telecommunications and transportation are the lifeblood of the country, and their importance is self-evident. Shanghai is the center of commerce and economy in the country, so the position of this bureau is the hub of domestic and international telecommunications traffic. However, during the war, the enemy harmed us, causing outstanding talents to scatter in all directions, and good equipment to be destroyed. After the victory, the machines left by the Japanese side were mostly obsolete and simple. In addition, there was a lack of materials, difficulties in transportation, and skilled talents were not easy to obtain. After repeated planning and rectification, fortunately, it has been gradually restored and there has been significant progress, which can be considered gratifying to the people of the country. Now, the general overview of the bureau's business is described as follows:</p>
<p>A. Telegraph Section.</p>
<p>Wired Telegraph: There are currently 17 direct wired circuits. Those using high-speed machines are Nanjing, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Hankou, Yin County, Wu County, Zhenjiang, etc. Those using sound machines are Wuxi, Jiaxing, Kunshan, etc. Those using voice transmission are Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiading, Chuansha, Baoshan, Wusong, Nanxiang, etc. Nanjing is the capital city, and the telegraph business is busy. In addition to high-speed machines, there are also facsimile telegraph machines and teletypewriter equipment to increase efficiency. High-speed machines use keyboard punching machines to punch telegrams into perforated paper strips, and then use automatic machines to transmit them to the other party. When the other party receives them, the receiving machine records the paper strips with wave symbols, which are copied by typists with typewriters and sent out. The machine can simultaneously send and receive up to 200 words per minute (five letters per word). However, due to line relations, the average is 100 words per minute. Sound machines listen to and copy sounds, and can send 20 to 25 words per minute. Voice transmission circuits transmit telegrams by telephone, and can transmit about 20 words per minute. Teletypewriters are the latest equipment, which are similar to ordinary typewriters. When sending a telegram, you only need to press the letters, and the other party will see clear letters, which can avoid the trouble of re-copying. They can send and receive 60 words per minute. Facsimile telegraphs are written by the sender in his own handwriting on specially prepared telegraph paper, and the traces are transmitted to the other party on the machine using telecommunications equipment. After a little finishing, a clear original handwriting appears, so it is also called a true handwriting telegram.</p>
<p>Wireless Telegraph: There are currently 25 direct wireless circuits. Those using high-speed machines are Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Chongqing, Hankou, Taipei, Guangzhou, etc. Those using manual machines are Xiamen, Shantou, Fuzhou, Yongjia, Dinghai, Yin County, Chongming, Haimen, Nantong, Lianyungang, Shenyang, Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Nanchang, Changsha, Hengyang, Chengdu, Kunming, etc. Wireless high-speed machines are the same as wired high-speed machines in form and use, but the former uses radio waves to transmit through the air. When it is smooth, it can send 120 words per minute, but when radio waves interfere and the weather changes, the speed may be reduced to 30 to 40 words per minute. Manual machines use hand sending and ear listening, and the speed is about 20 to 25 words per minute. The communication situation is the same as wireless high-speed machines.

<h3>Advantages of True Handwriting Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youjun</p>
<p>It is found that true handwriting telegrams are a kind of telecommunications image. Telecommunications images, originally Facsimile, were invented by the British physicist Alexander Bain in 1842 AD. After a long period of experimentation and research, they gradually appeared in commercial applications in 1915. In the past ten years, they have been widely set up in European and American countries. During the Anti-Japanese War, telecommunications image circuits were also set up between Chongqing and New York and London. After the war, our industry and commerce are waiting to be developed, and the adoption and expansion of true handwriting telegrams is an undertaking that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>This telegram is written by the sender on the true handwriting telegraph paper of the size prescribed by the Telecommunications Bureau, with words, patterns, etc. The Telecommunications Bureau rolls the paper into a special transmitting tube and uses the photoelectric effect of the machine to transmit it through radio waves. In a moment, the other party can receive the sent telegram on the recording machine with a special receiving paper. The handwriting is the same as that drawn by the sender, without any damage, which can be said to be perfect, which cannot be achieved by other communication methods. The advantages are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Accuracy: The transmission of true handwriting telegrams relies entirely on the photoelectric effect of the machine. What is sent is the telegram written directly by the sender, and what the other party receives is its image. Therefore, there are no errors in the mutual translation of text codes and manual sending and receiving of ordinary telegrams, which can be called absolutely accurate.</p>
<p>(2) Speed: All the procedures required to handle ordinary telegrams can be saved. It only takes a few minutes from sending from Bureau A to Bureau B. The receiving party only needs to take the receiving paper from the receiving machine and send it by special messenger immediately, so it is extremely fast.</p>
<p>(3) Economical and practical: The sender can write as much as possible on the specified paper, so the number of words is irrelevant to the telegram fee. If a small telegraph paper contains two or three hundred words, it can be sent and received calmly. Compared with ordinary telegrams that charge per word, it is much more economical. This telegram can be used with brush, pen (limited to black ink), and typing. Even patterns, schedules, accounts, etc. (within the specified size) can be transmitted. Therefore, if you want to use this telegram to express your congratulations, you may as well add a drawing of the celebration to the paper. If you want to order a telegram, you can also draw the size and style of the goods, which can be transmitted in the same way without any errors.</p>
<p>(4) Increase the feelings between senders and receivers: Telegrams are like letters, used to communicate feelings. When relatives and close friends hold weddings, you can send social telegrams to the Telecommunications Bureau. However, if you use true handwriting telegrams and write in a flowery script on the paper, supplemented by congratulatory pictures, the other party will be infinitely happy to receive the telegram. In other cases, wandering sons, lovers, and good friends can also see the ink marks of the text, comfort the soul's dream, and tell the heart to thousands of relatives.</p>
<p>The above points are the most important ones. People from all walks of life may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Here are two suggestions for improvement for the reference of our telecommunications authorities.</p>
<p>(1) According to the staff of the news agency in this city, they have been thinking of using true handwriting telegrams to replace the ordinary news telegrams to send news manuscripts to various places, but they can only make full use of the places where the true handwriting telegrams can reach today. Because the news industry is the throat of the country, it should be closely linked with the telecommunications industry to ensure smooth communication. Therefore, expanding the line, gradually opening busy places such as Pingwei, Hanyu, and Chongqing, and extending the daily power-on time, the wide use of the news media can be predicted.</p>
<p>(2) According to the current statistics, the content of true handwriting telegrams is mostly for celebrations, condolences, and other social occasions. The receiving paper of this telegram is made of special paper, and the paper surface is dark and dull. If it is a happy celebration telegram, you can make a paper slightly larger than the receiving paper, and the color is pink. The four sides are painted with golden patterns. After the telegram is received from the machine, it is pasted on it, and the same color art envelope is added. In the festive hall, the colorful telegrams are thrown, which can add a lot of color.</p>
<h3>Please Make Full Use of New Telecommunications Methods</h3>
<p>— Li Jiqing</p>
<p>The Telecommunications General Directorate of the Ministry of Communications has recently been actively improving telecommunications services and sparing no effort. In order to review the progress of work and plan future facilities, the directors of telecommunications bureaus in various regions and important cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Wuhan were convened in batches in May and June to hold telecommunications review meetings, and various issues were discussed in detail, so as to achieve the purpose of telecommunications serving the public. In addition, a "Public Service Group" was added to the bureau to handle matters related to telecommunications serving the public.</p>
<p>There are many new methods implemented in telecommunications recently. Here are some of the main points, and I hope that people from all walks of life will make full use of them, so that they can get various conveniences in daily life and when using telegrams and telephones.</p>
<p>(1) Service Desk: Each telecommunications bureau has a service desk dedicated to facilitating the public to answer inquiries about trains, airplanes, ship schedules, and local entertainment and broadcasting programs. (Telephone 115)</p>
<p>(2) Telephone Booth: Located in stations, docks, scenic spots, assembly halls, etc., with telephone equipment. In addition to handling public telephone and long-distance telephone services, it also accepts various telegrams and transmits them to the telecommunications bureau's newsroom for sending.</p>
<p>(3) Mobile Automobile Telecommunications Bureau: Major cities have opened mobile automobile telecommunications bureaus or business offices, which are either run by the telecommunications bureau itself or attached to the mobile post office. They travel daily on designated routes in various urban areas and stop to send and receive telegrams.</p>
<p>(4) Translation of Incoming Telegrams: Telecommunications bureaus in major cities have translated incoming telegrams. After receiving the telegram, the recipient can read and understand it. If the received telegram has not been translated, please report it to the Telecommunications Bureau (Telephone 11490).</p>
<p>(5) Telephone Notification to Collect Telegrams: If you have a telegram to send, please call 13059, and the Telecommunications Bureau will send a messenger to pick up the telegram and send it.</p>
<p>(6) Business Inspection: Telecommunications bureaus in major cities have business inspectors who regularly visit the outside world to investigate and negotiate telegraph and telephone matters. If you have any suggestions for improvement or dissatisfaction with telegraph and telephone services, please inform them in detail, and the authorities will handle it seriously.</p>
<p>(7) Test Letter: The Telecommunications General Directorate has printed telecommunications test letters and sent them directly to businesses and companies that send and receive telegrams and telephones. After receiving this test letter, people from all walks of life are welcome to fill it out in detail and express their dissatisfaction as much as possible so that the telecommunications bureau can understand the situation and find ways to improve.</p>
<p>(8) Telephone Transmission and Receipt of Telegrams: If you have a telegram to send, you can report it to the Telecommunications Bureau by telephone and have it copied and sent out. If you also want the incoming telegram to be transmitted by telephone, please inform the Telecommunications Bureau to do so. Please contact the Telecommunications Bureau in advance to use the telephone to transmit and receive telegrams smoothly.</p>
<p>(9) Social Telegrams: Social telegrams are specially prepared for use in weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. The methods are novel, the prices are cheap, and gift certificates can be attached.</p>
<p>(10) Nighttime Telegraph and Telephone Price Reduction: In order to reduce the burden on users, the Telecommunications General Directorate has opened nighttime letter telegrams from July 1, charging only 500 yuan per word. On the telephone side, nighttime reduced-price long-distance calls are open, calculated at 70% of the daytime normal calling price.</p>
<p>The above is a summary of the new telecommunications methods. Please use them as much as possible at any time. There are many other convenient methods. Please ask the local telecommunications bureau for inquiries and negotiations.</p>
<h3>Business Talks</h3>
<p>— Ye Changwei</p>
<p>70 Fuzhou Road is the general business office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and also the model business office in Shanghai. Hua works at the Telecommunications Bureau. Yang and Li are his classmates. The conversation starts with the business office, and a brief introduction to the recent improvements in telecommunications is given.</p>
<p>Yang: Brother Hua! You work in the Telecommunications Bureau. Can you tell me why it is so crowded when sending telegrams?</p>
<p>Hua: Oh! This is a long story. The reason for the congestion lies in the sender himself.</p>
<p>Li: Excuse me for interrupting, the congestion of the business office is due to the small number of staff and the slow handling. Why do you say it is due to the sender?</p>
<p>Hua: Well, the small number of staff and the slow handling are also one of the reasons, but you may know that there is a long queue every day on Fourth Road, while other branch business offices like Yuyuan Road and Sinan Road are sparsely populated. Senders often have a preconceived notion, that is, "Send a telegram, go to Fourth Road." They send telegrams to Fourth Road without making good use of the branch business offices, thus causing congestion at the general business office.</p>
<p>Yang: Oh! Is that the reason? Are there any other reasons?</p>
<p>Hua: Yes, some people who do not send telegrams often lack knowledge of telecommunications. They have to write a telegraph paper several times and queue up several times. This not only wastes their own time but also delays the time of others, which is also one of the reasons for the congestion.</p>
<p>Li: I want to interrupt again. The lack of public telecommunications knowledge is indeed a fact, but it is the responsibility of your Telecommunications Bureau to impart telecommunications knowledge!</p>
<p>Hua: Yes, we have started to handle this matter. First, we have set up a service desk in the general business office, specializing in solving difficulties for senders. For example, writing telegraph papers and explaining various questions about telegrams. Second, we print small telegraph formats and senders' instructions to senders. Third, we publish a special telecommunications issue in Shen Xin and Xinmin News every month, specializing in telecommunications consultations and articles related to telecommunications. In this way, we can reduce unnecessary trouble, and at the same time, we can provide a lot of convenience to senders.</p>
<p>Yang: This is a very good measure. I want to ask again, if we have any questions or new suggestions from the outside world, are you welcome?</p>
<p>Hua: We are not grateful enough, how can we not welcome them? If you have any questions about telecommunications or other valuable suggestions, please mail them in writing to the Business Inspection Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, 70 Fuzhou Road. It may be disclosed in the "Telecommunications Q&amp;A" in the social service column of Shen Bao every Saturday.</p>
<p>Yang: Okay.</p>
<p>Li: Okay, it's getting late, let's talk next time, goodbye.</p>
<p>Hua: Goodbye, please give us your advice often.</p>
<h3>Electric Sparks</h3>
<p>After the news that state-owned enterprises would generally raise prices from July 1 was revealed in the newspapers in this city, the telegraph and long-distance telephone business was particularly crowded on June 30. The on-duty clerks, telegraphers, operators, and other relevant personnel were all doubly busy that day. They were really sweating profusely and extremely hard.</p>
<p>The motivation for the increase in telegraph and telephone prices this time is that the telecommunications finances have suffered too much loss and have to be compensated for this. Because the prices of telegrams and telephones were too low in the past, the increase of four times this time seems a bit abrupt, and some people even think it is too high. In fact, it is not enough to compensate for the cost.</p>
<p>After the price increase of telegraph and telephone services, it is still very crowded and does not decrease.</p>
<p>After the increase in telegraph and telephone fees, in order to reduce the burden on the public, the highest telecommunications authorities created two new businesses. One is called nighttime letter telegrams, which serves the public by using the nighttime news service, which is more convenient, charging only 500 yuan per word. The other is called nighttime reduced-price long-distance calls, which is designed for users who do not have time or do not have time to make long-distance calls during the day. The fee is calculated at 70% of the daytime normal calling price. The call time is from 11:00 pm every day to 7:00 am the next day. The above two are both emerging popular telecommunications businesses.</p>
<p>On July 1, this bureau held a Sino-US resumption of communication ceremony, attended by Mayor Wu, Mrs. Mayor, Director Yu, Deputy Chief Engineer Zong, Section Chief Zhang of the Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Section, representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and more than 30 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers, with an unprecedented grand occasion. All the words of the call were recorded with the latest steel wire recorder to commemorate.</p>
<p>In order to increase the transmission rate, this bureau is adding teletypewriters between the general business office and the branch business offices. The North Station branch business office has been installed and applied first, with excellent results. The general business office of this bureau has added five new sofas for the rest of the senders, and a service desk is set up to answer telecommunications questions, which the senders call convenient.</p>
<p>The first mobile electric bureau of this bureau has been assembled and will soon run throughout the city.</p>
<p>On July 4, this bureau screened the film on business innovation and the film No. 1, inviting the bureau's colleagues and relatives and friends.</p>
<p>This magazine is published once a month on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Telegraphy Common Sense Talk (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Preface　Before the war, institutions handling telecommunications were called "Telegraph Bureaus" and "Telephone Bureaus" depending on the nature of their business. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications, in order to centralize authority and save manpower and resources, has merged various telecommunication businesses under the management of the "Telecommunication Bureau." Telecommunications include wired telegraphy and telephony, wireless telegraphy and telephony, as well as telephotography, etc. Therefore, the meaning of the word "telecommunications" is very broad, while "telegraphy" is only one type of "telecommunications." Generally, senders of telegrams still habitually call the Telecommunication Bureau the Telegraph Bureau, which should be corrected.</p>
<p>This article will cover the various telecommunication businesses mentioned above, and will focus on the telecommunication common sense that general customers need to understand, especially how to use telecommunications with the least cost and achieve the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Part 1　Telegraphy　Lecture 1: What is a Telegram?</p>
<p>Before getting to the main topic, let me tell two very interesting stories: I remember when the Qi and Lu armies were fighting a civil war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces before the Northern Expedition. At that time, I was still young and followed my parents to the countryside to take refuge. An old woman from a rural relative's family asked me to write a letter for her on a postcard. She called the postcard a "ginseng slice." She also told me that a "ginseng slice" only cost one and a half cents, which was half the price of sending a letter in an envelope, and you didn't have to spend extra money to buy envelopes and stationery. Based on her past experience, postcards weren't slower than letters, so she preferred to use postcards. Another story also happened in my childhood. At that time, I lived in a not-so-small city along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Once, a neighbor suddenly received a telegram from Tianjin—this was the first telegram he had ever seen in his life. At that time, the telegraph bureau did not translate Chinese telegrams into plain language, so as soon as he received the telegram, he became flustered and anxious. He was very worried because, according to the rumors he had heard, sending a telegram must be for events such as someone's death or someone being critically ill. Before he could decipher these convoluted foreign codes, he always thought that some ominous misfortune would befall his family. It wasn't until he found a newly compiled telegraph codebook in a bookstore and translated it word by word that he learned the good news that his son-in-law, who had been doing business far away and had lost contact for a long time, had returned to Tianjin from beyond the pass and had sent him a sum of money. From these two stories, it can be seen that knowledge of postal mail is already widely accepted by the public, but the public's understanding of telecommunications is very superficial.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is a telegram? In the most popular analogy, we can say that a telegram is a letter transmitted by electricity. Although the handwriting copied in the telegram is not entirely the letter writer's own, as in letters sent from the post office, this defect has now been remedied by "telephotography."</p>
<p>The biggest difference between postal mail and telegrams lies in the difference in transmission technology. The former uses transportation tools such as airplanes, vehicles, and ships, or manual carrying, etc., to transmit, while the latter uses wires (wired telegraphy) and radio waves (wireless telegraphy). Due to the differences mentioned above, postal charges are based on weight, while telegram charges are based on time. The time it takes to send a telegram is directly proportional to the length of the telegram, so the price of a telegram is calculated in units of words.</p>
<p>If we look at the structure of postal mail and telegrams, they are also very similar. A comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>(Structure of a Telegram)　(Structure of Postal Mail)</p>
<p>1.  Telegram Header　Equals　Postmark on the Envelope</p>
<p>2.  Payment Identification　Equals　Sticker on the Upper Right Corner of the Envelope</p>
<p>3.  Recipient's Name and Address　Equals　Recipient's Name and Address on the Letter</p>
<p>4.  Telegram Text　Equals　Text Written on the Letter</p>
<p>5.  Sender's Signature　Equals　Sender's Signature (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Forty-Nine Self-Description</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>An American scholar of "gerontology," Dr. Benjamin, once proposed a novel idea about human lifespan: "Young people do not necessarily have young physiological structures, and old people do not necessarily decline. Like some ancient trees, the older they get, the stronger they become, with lush branches and leaves and solid roots. The increase in age rings does not limit the development of their vitality. Therefore, some people who are sixty-five years old are still energetic and full of life, like the rising sun. On the contrary, many young people seem prematurely senile, as if they have already reached the twilight years."</p>
<p>I am enlightened by his brilliant insights and can find my own joy in difficult times. I will never lose heart or be discouraged because of the steady increase in age. When I am lonely, I wander through landscapes in my mind; when I participate in lively occasions, although I also enjoy joining in the fun, I still maintain an objective attitude and silently appreciate the world's phenomena. I love to smoke but am not addicted, I love to drink but have no drinking problem; I love to look at women but have no ambition. If wealth and high status are attainable, I would even be a whip-holding groom; if they are not attainable, I will follow my own inclinations. Also, because "I have no illness," I am not greedy for money or sex, nor do I want to stir up trouble in the world, turning clouds and rain, treating all things as straw dogs to fulfill my ambitions; nor do I indulge in foolish thoughts, getting up at dawn to tirelessly pursue profit, exchanging legal tender for US dollars, and US dollars for gold, preparing to take them into the coffin to be buried with me when I stop breathing. Therefore, although my hobbies are complex, they are actually very simple. Specifically, I like to keep in mind, within the scope of my acquaintance, the people who I absolutely cannot find fault with; however, I do not hope that they often keep me in mind. I like to write down on paper the various things I think of and come into contact with, and send them to friends who can control a supplement or magazine. If they can be published, then publish them; if there is any inconvenience, please throw them into the wastepaper basket. As for whether they can resonate with readers after publication, whether they will offend a certain class, and cause unpleasant reactions; whether they can be considered "immortal" masterpieces; I cannot worry about so much. How dare a humble person like me consider writing articles as one of the "three immortalities?" To be honest, it is just occasionally venting for a while when miscellaneous external and internal disturbances cause dizziness, to reduce the burden on my soul! How dare I, who love to dabble in literature, compete with contemporary democrats, who, although they are out of office, have their hearts set on the imperial court, and often issue declarations, send telegrams, and discuss world affairs while picking lice! It is indeed true that it is like taking a laxative, clearing out the accumulated dregs, so that they do not cause trouble in the stomach and damage one's health. My friends are surprised that I am constantly at my desk, writing non-stop, and never get sick, and that my spirit is always so abundant. Nearing fifty, I cannot find a single white hair, and they wonder what techniques I use to achieve this. Little do they know that I can write whatever I think of. The set of square characters that I have used for more than thirty years is controlled at the tip of my pen, and I can arbitrarily enslave them. No tyrant or demon king's enslavement of their people is as satisfying and thorough as my enslavement of this set of square characters. My tireless enjoyment of this contains a way to maintain health!</p>
<p>People can live long lives if they do not create their own misfortune and can all indulge themselves and understand how to maintain health. At the same time, to hope that society progresses and the country has a future, I also hope that the moon is always full and people live long lives. Because long-lived people have deep experience and a peaceful mind, they are not prone to anger and fighting like young lads, doing more harm than good. As the saying goes: "A mouth without hair does not do things firmly," which is what it means. In modern, more advanced countries, all the professors in universities, the people in charge of various ministries, especially the "generals and ministers," are all elders with long beards, and their brains are filled with experience and knowledge. They themselves are rich histories. China is not like this. Even university professors look like young lads. Foreign white-bearded old professors must be surprised. But this is not surprising, as the average age of Chinese people is only thirty! Poor compatriots, having suffered hardships and tribulations, and not seeing through the mundane world, by the time their experience and knowledge are about to mature, although they are not old in years, they have already reached the twilight of their lives. Currently, Americans are very serious about the study of longevity, extending the retirement time of working elderly people and increasing service efficiency as much as possible, which is the most economical and effective method. It is a truly irreparable waste for Chinese people to age prematurely, burying their full bellies of learning in the grave along with their diseased bodies!</p>
<p>A year on Earth has only three hundred and sixty days, and a day and night is only twenty-four hours. If we calculate based on a day and night on the moon being equal to four weeks on Earth, I am still a child of four or five years old! And in this short period, after deducting sleep, socializing, meetings, signing in, signing out, training, lectures... and various non-urgent matters, the time spent buried in work is only a very short moment, so even if there is a little achievement, it is truly insignificant. Therefore, although I have started my forty-ninth year, because my work must start from scratch, and I must never be complacent about the past, my working age is still very young! I am grateful to my friends in Chongqing, who want to imitate the anecdotes of great writers from home and abroad and celebrate my birthday this year, without a moment's rest, having written more than ten million words of "anti-Japanese stereotyped essays!" This heartfelt sincerity moves me to tears of shame. These cherished "Liaodong pigs" have no artistic life and will perish along with the deaths of the enemy and puppet regimes. What value is there in rewarding them! I also sincerely declined the good intentions of my friends. But I would like to briefly express my thoughts under the title "Forty-Nine Self-Description." From now on, I will only use my remaining time to do the work that I want to do. Apart from the necessary sleep time, I do not plan to waste my precious time on meetings, socializing, and acting on stage! There is too much that I want to write down myself. Although there is still a long time ahead, it is finite after all. I feel that I have no achievements to speak of, so I must cherish it even more; for example, the absence of a supporting role like me at any kind of meeting does not hinder the liveliness of the meeting, but it actually benefits me immensely!</p>
<h3>Reading "The Dream of Linchuan"</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>Jiang Shiquan's "The Dream of Linchuan," written for Tang Xianzu, can be read as a biography of Tang Xianzu and is the best of the nine dramas. I remember a Western literary scholar saying: "The true writer himself is a good poem." Tang Linchuan's good poem was written by Jiang Shiquan truthfully and artistically. Never has a biography written for someone one admires been as unique and lovely as this biography of Linchuan. Liang Rengong often lamented that China does not have long biographies of thousands of words like foreign biographical literature. Little does he know that "The Dream of Linchuan" is the best representative of Chinese literati biographies. It is more brilliant and has more artistic interest than Boswell's "Life of Johnson," although it uses a rhythmic drama form and not prose. (I read the large-character engraving of the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, collected by Hongxuelou, in the Qingrong Waiji.)</p>
<p>Tang Linchuan, named Xianzu, courtesy name Yireng, also known as Ruoshi, was from Linchuan, Jiangxi. He was born in the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing of the Ming Dynasty (1550) and died in the forty-fifth year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1617). He was naturally arrogant and did not admire the powerful and wealthy. In the fifth year of Wanli, when Zhang Juzheng was the powerful prime minister, Zhang wanted to promote his son to be the top scholar, and he was afraid that people would laugh at his son for not having real talent. So he forced Tang Xianzu and Shen Maoxue, the top scholars of the time, to be foils for his son, one as the second place and the other as the third place. As a result, Shen Maoxue went, but Tang Xianzu flatly refused, firmly unwilling to go, as he was ashamed to be a bridesmaid for others. It was not until the powerful Prime Minister Zhang Juzheng died that he came forward and became a Jinshi. While serving as a doctor at the Taichang Temple in Nanjing, he submitted a memorial criticizing the government for trusting private individuals and suppressing censors, a great article of thousands of words, very upright, so he was demoted to Dian Shi of Xuwen County. After taking office, he immediately established Guisheng Academy to lecture and change the customs of scholars, and later became the magistrate of Suichang.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he hated the false celebrity Chen Jiru (Meigong) and criticized him fearlessly, eventually suffering harm in secret and being unable to be used by the world, spending his remaining years in poverty and writing books. His most famous "Four Dreams of the Jade Tea Hall"—The Peony Pavilion (The Return of the Soul), The Purple Hairpin, The Dream of Nanke, and The Dream of Handan—became immortal masterpieces.</p>
<h3>Ladies</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhengbai</p>
<p>The original biography in the History of Ming says that he… "...His residence, the Jade Tea Hall, was littered with literary and historical works, chickens and pigs roamed freely in the courtyard. He leisurely sang and wrote, content with himself. The burdens in his heart were expressed in lyrics and dramas. His four dreams, although lingering in the memories of romance and moved by the states of things, were meant to cleanse the dust and return to nothingness, to achieve an open-minded view of emptiness, which is also sad..."</p>
<p>Based on this story, Jiang Shiquan created a twenty-act drama—The Dream of Linchuan—whose catalogue is: Rejecting the Spear, Hiding Treachery, Harmonious Dream, Imagining the Dream, Changing the Dream, Star Change, Resisting the Memorial, Bo Change, Sending the Captain, Dying for the Dream, Becoming an Official, Cripple, Continuing the Dream, Double Bite, Sending a Song, Visiting the Dream, Gathering the Dream, Flower Celebration, Speaking of Dreams, Ending the Dream, divided into two volumes.</p>
<p>The play depicts Yu Ergu, a woman from Loujiang, who became obsessed with reading "The Peony Pavilion" and even died for love. Her soul visits Linchuan, interspersed with current events at the time (such as Bo Chengen's rebellion and Mei Guozhen's suppression of bandits) and Linchuan's teaching achievements in Xuwen and his political achievements in Suichang. The final scene is a gathering of characters from The Return of the Soul, The Purple Hairpin, The Dream of Handan, and The Dream of Nanke in the Jade Tea Hall, each speaking of their dreams. The last two acts, Speaking of Dreams and Ending the Dream, vividly describe the essence of Linchuan's dramas.</p>
<p>The epilogue of the act Ending the Dream says: "The jade tea in front of the hall is now withered, putting all four dreams to rest from one dream. It is pitiful that this dream world is difficult to bear and difficult to end."</p>
<p>The ghost in "The Return of the Soul" (originally Du Liniang, but replaced by Yu Ergu), the knight in The Purple Hairpin (played by Princess Huo), the immortal in The Dream of Handan (played by Mr. Lu), and the Buddha in The Dream of Nanke (played by Chunyu Lang)—this is the meaning contained in the dream of returning. In the view of the general public, the judge (the true ghost in The Return of the Soul), the man in yellow (the true knight in The Purple Hairpin), Lu Weng (the true immortal in The Dream of Handan), and Qi Xuan (the true Buddha in The Dream of Nanke) should appear on stage. But the ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas are only the masters in the drama, not the masters in the author's mind. Du, Huo, Lu, and Chun are puppets on the stage, while the judge, the man in yellow, etc., are the puppeteers; the former four are people in the dream, and the latter four are people outside the dream. Since the meaning of the drama is based on ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas, then the subjective masters belong to the judge, the man in yellow, etc., while Du, Miss Huo, etc., are only the objective masters. Linchuan's genius and his thoughts can surpass the stereotypes of ordinary playwrights and must be sought in detail in such places.</p>
<p>Shiquan and Xianzu, although separated by generations, shared the same heart, precisely because their talents were the same, and their situations were not very different. Shi Xiangyun in "Dream of the Red Chamber" has a line about chrysanthemums: "Counting down, there is no one more proud than you, looking around, who has my soulmate." This can be used to describe Jiang Shiquan's gift to Tang Xianzu. Ancient literati, such as Feng Jing's "Self-Preface," followed by Liu Xiaobiao's "Self-Preface," followed by Wang Zhong's "Self-Preface," "What is the same in one, three different in four," has long been praised by literary researchers. Shiquan said in "The Dream of Linchuan," borrowing the words of Yu Sangu: "...It is only for thoroughly understanding the myriad feelings that I predict that few will understand the article here; therefore, I spend two cold windows and lamp oil, writing down the tears and laughter of your talented person!" Isn't this clearly declaring himself to be Linchuan's soulmate? Feng Xiaoqing read a poem about The Peony Pavilion: "The cold rain knocks on the window, unbearable to hear, I pick up the lamp and leisurely read The Peony Pavilion. There are also fools in the world like me, why is it only Xiaoqing who is sad!" This Xiaoqing and Yu Ergu of Loujiang may both be representatives of soulmates created by literati.</p>
<p>Shiquan's "Self-Preface" to "The Dream of Linchuan" says: "It is a pity that the woman from Loujiang died for the public, and her insight was far beyond that of the rulers at the time." It is not necessary to have this person, and it is not necessary to have this event. He originally spoke of dreams to satirize the world and expressed his feelings for a literary soulmate.</p>
<p>He also has a poem inscribed on "The Dream of Linchuan":</p>
<p>"Corrupt scholars talk about principles, difficult to cure the customs;</p>
<p>Lower scholars speak of emotions, the style is bitter and astringent;</p>
<p>Self-interest is devoid of righteousness, and seduction is rewarded;</p>
<p>The world is covered with coral nets, the creator pulls the puppet strings;</p>
<p>Beyond prosperity, decay, life, and death, the old man folds his hands and watches for a long time."</p>
<p>Reading this poem can further clarify the true purpose of Shiquan's creation of "The Dream of Linchuan," and Shiquan's views and thoughts on literary and artistic creation are also fully revealed.</p>
<p>Note: Jiang Shiquan, a native of Qianshan, courtesy name Xinyu, also known as Yuan Sheng, was born in the third year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty (1725) and died in the fifty-first year of Qianlong (1786). He wrote "Zhongya Tang Poetry Collection," which is known for its narration, with a beautiful, poignant, and moving style. His "Nine Dramas of the Red Snow House" are especially popular. Furthermore, according to Zheng Zhenduo's "Outline of Literature," Tang Xianzu died in 1622, which is the thirty-ninth year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty. It is unknown which is correct. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Ladies</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhengbai</p>
<p>The Ming History's Biography says he…“...lived in the Jade Tea Hall amidst a chaotic collection of literary and historical texts, chickens and pigs running around the courtyard, leisurely singing and writing. Burdens in his heart manifested as lyrics and plays. His four dreams, though nostalgic and moved by worldly affairs, ultimately sought to wash away worldly dust and return to nothingness, realizing the great view of emptiness, which is also lamentable…”</p>
<p>Jiang Shiquan, based on this account, composed a twenty-act play – “The Dream of Linchuan” – which includes: Rejecting the Dart, Concealing Treachery, Harmonious Dream, Imagining the Dream, Changing the Dream, Star Change, Resisting the Memorial, the Rebellion of Bo, Sending the Officer, Dying for the Dream, Achieving Office, Lame, Continuing the Dream, Double Bite, Sending a Song, Visiting the Dream, Gathering the Dream, Flower Celebration, Speaking of Dreams, and Completing the Dream, divided into two volumes.</p>
<p>The play depicts Yu Ergu, a woman from Loujiang, becoming obsessed with reading “The Peony Pavilion,” even dying for love and her spirit visiting Linchuan. Interspersed within are contemporary events (such as Bo Chengen’s rebellion and Mei Guozhen’s suppression of bandits), as well as Linchuan’s educational achievements in Xuwen and his political accomplishments in Suichang. The final scenes feature characters from “The Return of the Soul,” “The Purple Hairpin,” “The Dream of Handan,” and “The Dream of Nanke” gathering in the Jade Tea Hall, each sharing their dreams. The final two acts, “Speaking of Dreams” and “Completing the Dream,” exquisitely convey the essence of Linchuan’s plays.</p>
<p>The epilogue of the act “Completing the Dream” states: “The jade camellias before the hall are now withered, and all four dreams vanish into one dream. It is lamentable that this dream world is difficult to bear and difficult to complete.”</p>
<p>The ghost in “The Return of the Soul” (originally Du Liniang but replaced by Yu Ergu), the knight in “The Purple Hairpin” (played by Princess Huo), the immortal in “The Dream of Handan” (played by Mr. Lu), and the Buddha in “The Dream of Nanke” (played by Chunyu Lang) – these represent the meaning within the dream of return. In the view of ordinary people, the judge (the true ghost in “The Return of the Soul”), the man in yellow (the true knight in “The Purple Hairpin”), Lü Weng (the true immortal in “The Dream of Handan”), and Qi Xuan (the true Buddha in “The Dream of Nanke”) should appear on stage. However, the ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas are merely the masters within the play, not the masters in the author's intention. Du, Huo, Lu, and Chun are puppets on stage, while the judge, the man in yellow, etc., are the puppeteers pulling the strings. The former four are people within the dream, while the latter four are people outside the dream. Since the meaning of the play is based on ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas, the subjective masters belong to the judge, the man in yellow, etc., while Miss Du, Princess Huo, etc., are only objective masters. Linchuan’s genius and his ideas surpass the ordinary playwrights' limitations, which can be understood through meticulous examination of such details.</p>
<p>Shiquan and Xianzu, though separated by generations, shared the same heart because their talents were alike and their circumstances not too different. Shi Xiangyun in “Dream of the Red Chamber” had a line about chrysanthemums: “Counting them all, there is no one more proud than you; looking around, who is my confidant?” This can be adapted for Jiang Shiquan to gift Tang Xianzu. Ancient literati, like Feng Jing’s “Self-Preface,” followed by Liu Xiaobiao’s “Self-Preface,” and then Wang Zhong’s “Self-Preface,” what constitutes “one same and three different,” has long been praised by literary researchers. Shiquan, in “The Dream of Linchuan,” borrows the words of Yu Sangu to say: “… It is only because you see through the myriad sentiments that I surmise few will understand the article here; therefore, spending two cold window nights and burning orchid oil, writing out the tears and laughter of a talented person!” Isn’t this clearly declaring himself to be Linchuan’s confidant? Feng Xiaoqing, upon reading a poem about The Peony Pavilion, wrote: “The cold rain knocks on the window, unbearable to hear, I pick up the lamp and leisurely read The Peony Pavilion. There are also fools in the world like me, why is it only Xiaoqing who is sad!” This Xiaoqing and Yu Ergu of Loujiang may both be representatives of soulmates created by literati.</p>
<p>Shiquan’s “Self-Preface” to “The Dream of Linchuan” states: “It is a pity that the woman from Loujiang died for the public, and her discernment far exceeded that of the rulers at the time.” It is not necessary to have this person, and it is not necessary to have this event. He originally spoke of dreams to satirize the world and expressed his feelings for a literary confidant.</p>
<p>He also wrote a poem inscribed on “The Dream of Linchuan”:</p>
<p>“Corrupt Confucians talk of principles, difficult to cure the common folk;</p>
<p>Lower scholars speak of emotions, the style is bitter and astringent;</p>
<p>Hypocrites lack righteous thoughts, they eagerly praise lewd verses;</p>
<p>The human world is covered with coral nets, the creator pulls the puppet strings;</p>
<p>Transcending prosperity, decay, life, and death, the old man folds his hands and watches for a long time.”</p>
<p>Reading this poem further clarifies the true purpose behind Shiquan’s creation of “The Dream of Linchuan,” and Shiquan’s views and thoughts on literary and artistic creation are also fully revealed.</p>
<p>Note: Jiang Shiquan, a native of Qianshan, courtesy name Xinyu, also known as Yuan Sheng, was born in the third year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty (1725) and died in the fifty-first year of Qianlong (1786).

<h3>Preparatory Office of the Municipal Museum of Art: Preface to the Centennial Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— With Explanatory Notes</p>
<p>Some might say: Scholars of painting boast of the Tang and Song dynasties, yet the Museum of Art uniquely champions the recent century. Does this mean their vision is regressive? I say, yes and no! Poetry, even reaching Du Fu, attained sainthood. Yet Du Fu said, "Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo were in the style of their time, not belittling today's people while loving the ancients." Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo were less than a century before Du Fu, yet the decline of their style was like a river breaking its banks and rushing downward daily. Du Fu lamented this and sought to revive it, boldly taking on the mission of promoting the way of poetry from Yu to the Rites. Yet he did not loudly praise the Han and Wei dynasties, but uniquely championed not belittling Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo. Why? It is to draw near, taking what everyone is accustomed to knowing and seeing as a benchmark for study and correction. It is like a long journey, where one must ascend from the lowest point to reach Mount Tai and view all under heaven. If one has not climbed Mount Juolai but first attempts to scale the summit of Mount Dai, lacking wings to rely on leaping to surpass the peak, I do not believe they will not break their arms and legs, falling into a ditch!</p>
<p>Is it not the same with painting? Today, people boast of Tang painting. Tang took Wang Wei as the Southern School. Since the Song dynasty, how many people can speak of Wang Wei's authentic works? Li Sixun was taken as the Northern School. Since the Song dynasty, how many people can speak of Li Sixun? Descending to the Five Dynasties, the traces of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran should be visible. Yet the scarcity of Jing Hao and Guan Tong's authentic works is like Wang Wei and Li Sixun. Dong Yuan and Ju Ran are more numerous. Those that can be counted are fewer than ten in all the vastness of the world. The uncertainty of authenticity has been debated and recorded throughout history, much like debating the Rites. To boast of Tang and Song dynasties is like a blind man feeling an elephant, taking a part for the whole. How can one not be confused?</p>
<p>Song painting flourished after the Taiping Xingguo era, reaching a millennium now. The flourishing of painters doubled that of the Tang dynasty. Yet Mi Fu already made the "No Li" argument (Li Cheng of Yingqiu became a successful candidate, about one hundred and thirty years before Mi Fu.) Descending to Mi Fu and Su Shi, they are also difficult to find. Since the opening of the Qing Palace Museum, famous paintings from the Southern Song dynasty have begun to appear to the world. Yet without scholars of great insight and extensive reading, it is insufficient to examine their origins and determine their authenticity. Thus, to view the authentic works of the Tang and Song dynasties is like climbing the summit of Mount Tai. The Yuan dynasty is the Tianmen of Mount Tai. Its changing clouds, lush trees, and rugged rocks are easily seen even from Mount Juolai. From the early Ming dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, four hundred years is like Mount Juolai of Mount Tai. Since the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, the recent century is like Beiman Mountain, attached to Mount Tai but barren and vulgar, seemingly unapproachable. Yet the villagers and herdsmen of the nearby areas all know Beiman Mountain. They visit it in the evening and reside there in the morning. Every stream and every rock are well-known to them. Can those who admire Mount Tai leap over Beiman Mountain to reach the summit? The history of painting in the recent century awaits our generation to take this path to ascend to the Tang and Song dynasties. This is known without the need for wisdom!</p>
<p>Moreover, the Tang and Song dynasties each existed for several hundred years. The families famous for painting, those with dramatic traces that can be accounted for, number less than several dozen each. The Yuan dynasty existed for eighty years. The famous families with dramatic traces that can be accounted for number no more than several dozen. The Ming dynasty existed for two hundred years. Those that can be accounted for number no more than a hundred or so. The Qing dynasty existed for three hundred years. Those that can be accounted for number no more than two hundred. From the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods to the Republic of China, only a century has passed. Yet those whose names can be listed, whose works can be seen as attached to the ranks of famous families, number more than three hundred! Why were the famous families of the past few and refined, while those of today are numerous and mixed? It is simply that the recent era is easy to know, while the distant era is easy to fade.</p>
<p>Moreover, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran are mentioned together, yet they are separated by nearly a century. The Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty are also separated by nearly a century. Descending to Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying, Qiu Ying and Shen Zhou are also separated by nearly a century. The Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping are mentioned together. Yun Shouping and Wang Shimin are also separated by several decades. During these periods, the multitude of painters flourished like spring grass, not just transmitted by Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Ni Zan, Wu Zhen, the Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping. This is the weeding out of the era. The era is like a sieve, and painters are like sand. After sifting the sand to find gold, only a few remain within a century. From the Xianfeng period to today, another century has passed. The flourishing of painters is like spring grass. After sifting the sand to find gold, how many can remain? How many can take the place of the Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping to serve as a stepping stone to the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties? This is what we do not know. To boast of the distant while ignoring the near, I do not know if it is possible. Thus, the Museum of Art initiated the Centennial Painting Exhibition and asked me to write a preface, along with the following explanatory notes:</p>
<p>1.  From the Xianfeng reign to the 36th year of the Republic of China, only ninety-seven years have passed. Liu Yanchong and Fei Xiaolou both died in the late Daoguang period. Thus, the chronology actually begins in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign. In terms of eras, it begins with the first year of the Xianfeng reign to clarify the details.</p>
<p>2.  Since the last century, famous families are like a vast sea. Like trawling the sea for coral, it is difficult to avoid missing some. How can there not be virtuous people in both bustling cities and remote villages? The knowledge of our colleagues is shallow, and what is missed is even more. Since this exhibition is initiated by the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Museum of Art, those famous figures who have lived in Shanghai are given priority, and other famous figures are briefly introduced.</p>
<p>3.  This exhibition is limited by the venue. The maximum number of exhibits is no more than three hundred. They are listed in the catalog in order of the number of strokes in their surnames, with brief biographies for easy reference.</p>
<p>4.  The purpose of this exhibition is for public study and criticism. Therefore, the exhibits are selected to ensure that each artist has representative works. For artists with abundant works and easily obtainable collections, such as Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo, etc., the selection is simplified.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to the curators' dedicated collection efforts, we hope collectors will provide more exhibits, especially rare fine pieces from lesser-known artists. If you are willing to lend exhibits, please contact the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Museum of Art at 139 South Shaanxi Road to obtain the exhibit guidelines and forms.</p>
<p>6.  Exhibits should primarily be mounted scrolls. Due to display considerations, hand scrolls and album leaves will be minimized.</p>
<p>7.  This exhibition is named the "Centennial Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition." However, there are too many calligraphers in the past century. Therefore, this exhibition will focus on "calligraphers' paintings" and "painters' calligraphy." Other calligraphers will have to be omitted.</p>
<p>8.  This exhibition encourages audience criticism. If you would like to submit written comments, please send them to the Preparatory Office for selection and publication into a special collection.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 342</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Around dusk, the four people who went out to scout returned. Liu was the first to come back, followed by Du Er and Liu Wu half an hour later. They all looked tired but excited. Although the three people's reports had some differences, most of them were not important. Only two points were worth noting: (1) The Japanese army's general headquarters and the special operations unit (secret agents and plainclothes officers) command center were not located in Changping city. Although the exact location was not clear, it could be determined that it was in a small town at the intersection of the Shahe and western Changping lines. This was a military secret, so of course, it was impossible for the scouts to find out at once. (2) It was confirmed that the Japanese invaders had chosen the second dog day, which was August 8th, to launch the offensive on Kou.</p>
<p>I cannot explain how the local people were disturbed. In short, everything can be summarized by the words "suffering" and "pain." However, there was one special characteristic of the people's behavior: despite the low cultural level of this small place, almost below zero, the local workers dared to say that there was not a single traitor. On the contrary, all the people, regardless of gender or age, were truly able to act on the words "Resist Japan": those who could leave had already left, and those who could not leave absolutely refused to be tempted by foreign traitors or threatened by Japanese ruffians. The strong men who were forced into service would not move unless they were beaten, and even if they did move, they would not work hard. The women who were captured would always cry and resist. It was truly not easy for these untrained, unorganized civilians to passively resist under the threat of iron hooves and bayonets.</p>
<p>After the lights were lit, "Zero Four" was still nowhere to be seen. Although I knew he would not cause trouble, I was still worried about him because he had a bold way of doing things. After speaking with Mr. W again at ten o'clock, "Zero Four" was still nowhere to be found. It wasn't until midnight, when I was preparing the telecommunications equipment to connect with Panyang Tokyo, that I suddenly heard a low-pitched sound outside the window. I lowered my voice and exchanged code words with Liu Wu, who was on duty. Then, I saw a tall, staggering figure enter the house, followed by a smaller figure. There were no lights in the room, so it was darker than outside. From the inside room, it was even darker, so I could still see the movements outside.</p>
<p>"Secretary-General." Although his voice tried to sound calm and respectful, it could not hide the tone of joy.</p>
<p>"Come in." I greeted him, and at the same time, the coded call sign I sent out was waiting for a response. (342)</p>
<p>Idle Talk</p>
<h3>Drama and Reality</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>The film "The Fake Phoenix and the Empty Mandarin Duck" was temporarily suspended during the preview due to the involvement of barbers, who protested against it.</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, this is not the first time that a movie theater in Shanghai has been attacked for the same reason.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road was not only wrecked, but even the films were burned.</p>
<p>Originally, drama and film should not be separated from reality. What they reflect is a part of life and society, and the characters they portray are living archetypes in society. Gogol's "The Government Inspector" is still being performed in Meixian, Guangdong. The hospital director's embezzlement and bribery in "Transformation" can still be seen everywhere. Is the Hou Chaozong in "The Peach Blossom Fan" not still clearly visible today?</p>
<p>Therefore, those with calm minds should not be overly demanding of the reflection of reality in films and dramas, thinking that this has hurt someone or satirized someone!</p>
<p>The central issue is that if the content of the drama or film distorts the facts, deliberately fabricates rumors and slanders, then protests should be raised.</p>
<p>For example, in American films, there are often scenes that insult Chinese people and misunderstand Chinese customs. We should not only protest, but also clearly point out the errors.</p>
<p>Looking at films and dramas from this perspective may avoid many unnecessary disputes.</p>

<h3>The "Mystery" of Flying Saucers</h3>
<p>— Yu Ying</p>
<p>Editor's note: This publication published the truth about "flying saucers" yesterday. Today, we are publishing Mr. Yu Ying's "Mystery" of flying saucers to help readers understand what the "flying saucers" that caused a stir in the United States are all about.</p>
<p>Americans are keen on exaggerating the power of the atomic bomb, as if they are all afflicted with atomic disease. On the one hand, this naturally shows the American's vigor, wealth, and willingness to research new things. On the other hand, because the Second World War had just ended, everyone was terrified by the cruelty of the war, so they had to use more cruel fantasies to numb themselves.</p>
<p>We can also view the recent busy work of the American government and public on the "flying saucer mystery" in the same way.</p>
<p>The so-called "flying saucer," after countless observations and the pursuit of many planes, was finally proven to be just one of the high-altitude weather measuring devices. The structure is fragile, almost like paper, and the raw material is obviously some kind of tin foil. According to Brigadier General Remer, commander of the Eighth Air Force in Texas, "It doesn't seem to have anything special."</p>
<p>Therefore, the previously widespread speculations, such as (1) a foreign-designed secret germ weapon, (2) a new type of army rocket, (3) a space ship, etc., have all become "self-deprecating" jokes.</p>
<p>A few tin foil "flying saucers" excited the American government and public for many days. Everyone was a little suspicious and panicked. Its power was too great. However, after being exposed, this is not the power of "flying saucers." It is precisely because the destructive power of war is too great, and the atomic bomb is still in the hands of Americans. Judging others by themselves, they cannot help but worry every day that other countries will invent some unorthodox tricks, which is why "flying saucers" appeared. In fact, this is just the beginning. Before "flying saucers," haven't there been rumors of "rockets" and the like along the American coast?</p>
<p>Therefore, to investigate the true mystery of "flying saucers," it is not enough to simply study its structure and analyze its inner workings. What is important is to clarify why most Americans are so enthusiastic about "flying saucers" today? All the embellishments, rumors, suspicions, exaggerations, and emphases actually stem from one reason: the disharmony between the allied countries after the war has led to this. And the true mystery of "flying saucers" lies here.</p>
<h3>Eternal Sky Length</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>Flying saucers</p>
<p>"Flying saucers" are making trouble and spreading news, who is deliberately joking? Star-like radiance, mystery-like wonder; thirty-three states are not panicked!</p>
<p>This unorthodox trick, perhaps stole the "Investiture of the Gods"? Ancient books have many magic treasures, ask "the seer" must know!</p>
<h3>Talking about the Three Elders of Drumming</h3>
<p>— Drummer</p>
<p>Finally, let me talk about Liu Baoquan.</p>
<p>Baoquan's singing of Beijing-style drum music can be said to be universally praised. Baoquan came to Shanghai for the first time at the New World. After the Bingwu year, although I had heard him in Peiping, he had not yet enjoyed great fame. Between the Xinhai and Renzi years, in Tianjin, people greatly praised him. During my leisure time, I often went to the New World with my nephews and nieces. The first day at the New World, I went with my wife. He sang "Li Kui Seizes the Fish," which was Baoquan's forte. A certain great writer said it was "The Biography of Xiang Yu." "A scholar should be looked at with new eyes after three days," let alone after several years. I listened for fifteen days and believed that his singing style was truly different from others. Among them, the two episodes of "Battle of Changsha" and the two episodes of "Ningwuguan" were the most outstanding. Indeed, Quan's spear and sword stances originally had the loyalty and bravery of Guan Yu and Zhou Cang. Although both were heroic and majestic, Zhuang Mu's life always had some arrogance. Zhou's family was loyal and righteous, from the old mother to the loyal servant, each with their own spirit, each with their own thoughts, each with their own tone. Baoquan's singing style, the shortness of the hero's breath, and the length of the children's feelings, can be regarded as considerate and thorough, just like Shi Nai'an's writing of the Water Margin characters, with various different writing styles. In the Battle of Changsha, the Tao Yuanming brothers were energetic, and Guan Yu, although proud, righteously released Huang Zhong, with a heart of cherishing talent. Baoquan also sang it vividly.</p>
<p>Baoquan came to Shanghai three times. The second time, he sang "The Great Western Chamber." Others sang this, although the words and sentences were completely the same, they were far less good than Baoquan. First, he had a strong breath; second, he had enough mouth strength; third, his pronunciation was clear and bright; fourth, he depicted it vividly and accurately. The beginning was like painting a delicate girl, and then gradually the two girls answered each other, like good birds playing in the sunshine, the tone gradually changed from slow to fast, like a sudden rain hitting plantain leaves, the faster the clearer. It was like what Bai Juyi said in his poem, "Large pearls and small pearls fall on a jade plate," the plate is round and the pearls roll, done in one breath, without a single word lagging behind. Hongniang enters the Western Chamber, the pace is first urgent, then slow and humorous. Others hear it and think they can breathe a sigh of relief, but they don't know that it is precisely the critical moment, the more humorous the words, the more nervous the spirit, a small Hongniang, about to come out. Singing to this point, it is almost divine. However, the drum king's diction is not fluent, which is inversely proportional to Jianchen's deep knowledge of literature and art, which can be regarded as a minor flaw in perfection. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Where's the Fire?</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>A certain person had a wife who was very lazy. Every day before he went to work, she had to lie in bed. Therefore, he was thinking of an opportunity to correct her. One day, after he arrived at the office, he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to bring an important official document, so he hurried home. At that time, the sun was already high in the sky, but his wife was still sleeping soundly in bed. He shouted loudly downstairs: "Fire! Fire!" His wife woke up in a daze, hurriedly put on her clothes, and ran downstairs as if flying, asking her husband: "Where's the fire? Where's the fire?" Her husband replied leisurely: "Besides our house, everyone else has fire!"</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Concentration Camps Become Safe Havens for Japanese</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese Americans were still free to move about. However, a group of Japanese ate American food but spied for the Japanese, preparing a network of spies for the Japanese navy to land in the United States. There was no other way but to put them in concentration camps. This benefited the Chinese. The businesses run by Japanese Americans, such as restaurants and farms, were sold to the Chinese at low prices. The United States specially built new Japanese settlements for the Japanese. Not only was accommodation free, but even food was free. There was also a supply of milk to eat. In addition to eating and living for free, the U.S. government provided pocket money. The U.S. government did nothing less than become a dry father for the Japanese Americans. The Americans could be said to be recognizing a thief as a son.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese Americans were confined to concentration camps, they had considerable freedom of movement. It was stipulated that they could enter the city twice a week. They could ask for leave to go out at any time for special matters. There was a Japanese American concentration camp outside Chandler, Arizona. Every time I entered the city, there were always half a busload of Japanese girls. Although they were born in the United States, they still had Eastern charm. They talked and laughed loudly in the car. Japanese women have always been happy, so the life in the concentration camp must have been quite good, so they laughed so vigorously. When American children saw Japanese people, they pointed and shouted Japs, Japs. The Japanese did not admit that they were Japs, which is Japanese, just as China did not admit that it was Chink but rather Chinese. Because the Cantonese are particularly short, I mistakenly thought that my classmate Guan Jiezhen was Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese Americans were divided into two major factions: pro-American and pro-Japanese. The two factions often fought in concentration camps. The government allowed the pro-American faction to join the army, perform meritorious service, and atone for their sins. The Japanese Americans who fought in Italy performed immortal feats. The commander of the Japanese American troops, including the commander, was entirely Japanese. Before Japan surrendered, most Japanese Americans had regained their freedom and returned to their old jobs, engaged in farming. (18)</p>
<h3>The U.S. State Department - The Overall Hub for Implementing National Policy and Planning Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Baoqing</p>
<p>The new building on Virginia Avenue and 21st Street in Washington D.C. is the center of U.S. diplomacy - the location of the State Department. The State Department was established in 1789. The eight staff members at that time have expanded to nearly eight thousand internal staff members and more than eleven thousand stationed ambassadors, consuls, and staff abroad. The financial budget has also increased to 178 million U.S. dollars. Because it used to manage both internal and external administration, it is called the State Department. Although a separate Department of the Interior has now been established, it still handles matters related to the national seal, the promulgation of laws, and so on. It holds the leading position among all departments.</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall oversees diplomatic administration. Under him is Under Secretary of State Lovett, a banker who has served as Under Secretary of the Air Force for the Department of the Army. He is highly organized and is responsible for assisting the Secretary of State in handling matters related to the formulation of diplomatic policies, receiving foreign guests, and supervising the implementation of diplomatic policies. He can also act as the head of the department and often advances and retreats with the President and Secretary of State. There is also a dedicated consultant, currently held by Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>There are six Assistant Secretaries of State: Major General Hildring is in charge of the Occupied Areas, but it is rumored that he will soon leave office; Clayton is in charge of International Economic Affairs; Banden is in charge of Public and Cultural Relations; Penlifu is in charge of Administrative Affairs; Amar is in charge of Latin American Affairs; Dunn is in charge of European, Asian, and African Affairs. Under these are six divisions, including Europe, the Far East, the Near East and Africa, the Americas, Political Affairs, and Intelligence, which govern 24 sections, including the British Empire, China, Japan, South Asia, the Near East, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and so on.</p>
<p>Marshall has also established a Diplomatic Policy Design Committee within the department, chaired by Mr. Gengnan, deputy director of the Diplomatic Group of the Army University, with five experts serving as committee members and professional diplomat Savage serving as executive secretary. Gengnan is an expert on Soviet issues, so it can be predicted where the focus of future U.S. diplomacy will be. The committee's job is to study and determine fundamental diplomatic policies and their implementation guidelines, and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Like the general staff department of the General Staff Headquarters, the committee's work is directed by the Deputy Secretary of State. In the past, the State Department's task was only to be responsible for diplomatic administration, representing the government in implementing national policy in the international arena. Now it is planning diplomatic decisions. Moreover, Marshall is preparing to take over the control of the U.S. occupied areas of Germany and Japan from the military. This action changes the 158-year tradition of the State Department and directly intervenes in actual administration. He is currently planning and will implement aid to European countries!</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the U.S. President, based on national policy, can handle major diplomatic affairs and decide diplomatic policies. This was most evident in the power of the White House when President Roosevelt was in office. Other government departments, such as the Treasury Department, the Department of the Army and Navy, and the U.S. delegations in international organizations, can also perform diplomatic affairs as required by their duties, but this must be in contact with and under the guidance of the State Department.</p>
<p>In the State Department, the Far East Division has the greatest relationship with our country. The division was established in 1908. The Director-General manages the diplomatic affairs of Far Eastern countries such as China, Japan, and the border countries. The three deputy directors are responsible for the Far East, economic affairs, diplomacy, processing and investigating Chinese and Japanese diplomacy, and training Far Eastern diplomatic talents, protecting overseas Chinese, and so on. The current Director is Mr. Fan Xuande, who has reached the end of his service in the department this year and will be sent abroad. The United States values experts, so diplomatic personnel also pay attention to professionalization. Marshal Marshall is actively reorganizing diplomatic personnel.</p>
<h3>Rare News from Overseas</h3>
<p>— Maple Leaf</p>
<p>New Type of Musical Instrument</p>
<p>Anyone who can now play an ordinary accordion can play a large organ, but at present it is not easy to use this new instrument in concerts. It weighs more than a ton and must be pulled by a truck. When used, the player presses the keys of an ordinary accordion, and the keys are connected to the reeds of a large organ, and the reeds are activated to make sound. Its inventor, a French youth, is holding concerts in Paris with this instrument.</p>
<p>Lake Water Boils</p>
<p>Recently, ten tons of surplus wartime metallic sodium were dumped into Lake Lenore, Washington, causing the lake water to boil and produce huge clouds of steam. The violent interaction of water and sodium added seventeen tons of lye to the lake, while decomposing nearly eight tons of water to release hydrogen and oxygen. The burning hydrogen and oxygen then combined in the air to produce a cone-shaped water vapor curtain weighing more than seven tons, hundreds of feet high and visible from miles away. This batch of sodium was dumped into the lake because it could not be transported to industrial users.</p>

<h3>The Epiphyllum (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>Now, let us use a more scientific method to describe the morphology of the Epiphyllum.</p>
<p>In the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, when I was in Yongjia, on November 3rd, Mr. Wang Mu, an agricultural expert, gifted me an Epiphyllum flower that had bloomed the previous night. This was the first time I saw a real Epiphyllum flower, and to this day, it remains the only time I have seen a real Epiphyllum flower. For future reference, I made the following record at the time:</p>
<p>"The flower, when unopened and closed, resembles a goose's head (a bloomed flower is closed). The tube is slender and long, resembling a flower stalk, curved in the center, with the throat facing upwards. The surface is herbaceous red, and the lower part of the ovary is slightly green. The outer side of the tube is sparsely covered with short, small scales, which become denser and longer towards the upper end. The outer side of the throat has two or three layers, totaling more than ten pieces, long, wide, and light in color, resembling sepals. Inside are the petals, white with a slight green tint, totaling about twenty pieces. The ones on the inner side are wider and thinner, obovate, with pointed tips and slight mucronate tips. The veins are faint, appearing like fine gauze.</p>
<p>"There are numerous stamens, arranged in two groups, upper and lower: the lower group is scattered from the curved part of the tube to the bottom of the throat; the upper group is arranged in parallel on all four walls from the bottom of the throat to the opening, where they become free; the shortest distance between the attachments of the upper and lower groups is three to five centimeters. The filaments are tender white and slender—the ones growing on the ventral side are shorter, and the upper group growing on the ventral side curves upwards. The anthers are pale yellow, straight, facing the ventral side, and the pollen is spherical.</p>
<p>"The ovary is inferior, with one chamber, parietal placentation, containing numerous inverted ovules, lenticular and thin, with slender funiculi. The style is slender, tender white, hollow; the apex is divided into fourteen segments, which are the stigmas, some of which are further divided into two at the tips; resembling sea anemones or the tentacles of octopuses, about one and a half centimeters long, tender yellow.</p>
<p>"The entire flower is thirty-one centimeters long, the petals are six to seven centimeters long, and three to three and a half centimeters wide..."</p>
<p>At that time, for ease of observation, I bisected the flower into two halves, and after observation, I pressed it into a herbarium specimen, which is still preserved to this day.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I went to Mr. Wang's residence again, and saw that the flower was a cactus of the Cereus type, but the stem was harder and did not hang upside down, with a height of more than two chi.</p>
<p>Plants of the cactus family are native to the tropics and subtropics of the Americas. In climates like Shanghai, they cannot grow in winter. The fact that they can bloom in Yongjia in November means that they must be protected in a greenhouse in Shanghai. The reason why Epiphyllums are not very common is because of this. Moreover, because they are not easy to grow here, each Epiphyllum branch cannot bloom every year, which is how the saying "blooms once every fifty years" originated.</p>
<p>We unfortunately do not know exactly where in the Americas the Epiphyllum originated, when it was introduced to the East, when it was introduced to our country, and where it was first cultivated.</p>
