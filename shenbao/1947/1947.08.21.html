<h3>魏德邁一度來滬　完成未了事務當日返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕魏德邁特使昨日上午自京乘專機抵滬，午間與美國代理總領事邁亞共進午餐，下午曾與美方在滬人士有所唔談，至五時許乘原機返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕魏德邁偕譯官伍漢民上尉，廿日上午十時離京飛滬，作一日停留，以完成其前數度未能結束之事務。下午七時於驟雨新籌中返抵首都，使團之其他人員均留京研究資料，並準備日內之其他約會。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿日電〕魏德邁廿日在滬一日之勾留，乃在搜集資料以補充準備向杜魯門總統所提出之報告。觀察家相信，中國政府頒布新外滙辦法後，渠對於上海方面之反響想來頗為注意。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕據接近魏使團人士稱：目前使團趕寫之報告，僅為片段者，類皆各種資料之整理工作，將來向美總統提出之總報告，尙待返抵華府後始可開始。魏氏前略感不爽，現已痊可。又據稱：魏氏來華期問，逐日堅張工作，從未中輟，昨日即曾工作至午夜二時。</p>
<h3>放棄東北建議　魏使不予支持</h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿日電〕魏德邁所搜集資料中，有不少部分指出，自嚴格軍事觀點上言之，放棄東北，不失為一聰明辦法。但其他因素，使調查事實之魏德邁代表團，實際上不能支持此一政策。軍事問題以外，魏德邁尙遭遇其他事實，足以影響其建議中之觀點。最為重要者，即為經由美國援助，始將日本打出東北。</p>
<p>接近代表團方面人士之消息稱，魏德邁對於任何無異事實上承認中共政權之建議行動，將加延緩。第一，在美國援助蔣生席將日人驅出東北後，如再有此舉，即無異再度放棄東北。第二，根據若干觀察家意見，此舉亦無異將廣大區域，置於有潛勢力之蘇聯控制下之傀儡政府之下。再者，據渠等指出、如美國欲援助中國復興，美國即不能採取一項使中央政府不能獲得重要東北資源如煤及鋼鐵之政策，東北資源之不能獲得，早巳盛覺影響嚴重。其他因素魏德邁得加重考慮者有</p>
<p>（一）如國軍定能劃界而守，退出東北，共黨之願否限制其活動於東北，並無保障。</p>
<p>（二）美國現行之『防共政策』，應加注意。</p>
<p>（三）過去美國政策及行動、亦須注意及之，因美國過去行動，仍為共黨念念不忘。在最近之廣播中，渠等促人注意，魏德邁在中日戰爭結束時，以中國戰區司令交格負責將國軍運往華北及東北。中共宣稱，渠等旣竊逐日軍退出東北，亦定能將美帝國主義逐出東北。</p>
<h3>川文化界建議　嚴格管制日本</h3>
<p>聯名上書魏德邁特使</p>
<p>〔本報成都十九日電〕川省文化界人士王北榮，向傳義等十九日特聯名上書魏德邁特使，剖析富前情勢，提出建議三點：（一）嚴格對日管制，愼防東山再起。（二）援助中國政府戡亂。（三）堅定對華政策，扶持中國復興。聯名簽署者達五百餘人。</p>
<h3>加赴日考察團　一行抵京訪問</h3>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕加拿大派赴日本之，察　克利拉將軍，賴特准將及工業家布克一行，廿日下午四時許自東京飛抵南京。四引擎軍用機降落於大校場機場後，加大使戴為世，國府參軍唐君鉑（代表蔣主席），外部禮賓司長蔆其翰（代表王外長），國防部一廳情報處長楊日齡（代表白部長）等，均趨前晤談。克列兩氏均着戎裝，下機留影後並當場答記者問稱，渠等係首次來華至為　舊，此行純為友誼訪問性質。　　被派赴日之任務乃攷察日本一般情形，俾協助政府準備對日和會及和約之工作，三週來已有不少收穫。另據包克語記者：「　本之經濟現况頗劣，尤以燃料缺乏，工廠開工者極少一。唯當詢以有關日本賠償之問題時，渠則拒稱答復。彼等定廿一日拜會我政府首長，下午五時晋謁蔣主席，晚出席王外長酒會，廿二日午晚分應美軍顧問團長魯克斯將軍及白部長邀宴，晚出席加使館酒會廿三日飛穗轉港返國。</p>
<p>又據中央社南京廿日電稱，克氏甫下飛機即詢孫立人將軍之行止，蓋孫氏曾與渠在荷蘭相識，並曾參觀克氏所率之加第一軍事團，團員賴特准將及布克二氏今同機抵達。據外交部為該代表團排定訪問之日程為：廿一日午前光後拜會王部長世杰，，白部長崇禧及張院長羣，午後拜會俞部長大維。</p>
<h3>蒲立德抵京　擬再晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕蒲立德廿日上午九時悄然飛京，仍住北極閣宋子文公館，廿一日將與魏德邁會晤，並共進午膳，日內並擬再謁蔣主席。</p>

<h3>停售美金庫券　財部擬定辦法　已售出者照官價折國幣償還</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕聯合徵信所訊：自外滙管理新辦法公布後，關於美金庫券是否繼續出售，業經財部擬定辦法兩項，送請政院核示，辦法如下：（一）不再繼續發售，（二）已售出之二千七百萬美元，當仍照官價折合國幣，陸續償還。又悉：政府作是項決定，係因甲·數月來售出之二千七百萬美元，距預定目標甚遠，無再售價值。乙·官價於相當時期後若有調整，如繼續照官價出售，將來還本時，政府損失甚大，但如照市價出售及還本，則將牽涉廿七·廿九·卅一等年所發行之美金公債還本問題。</p>

<h3>政府決統一幣制　東北流通券將入關使用　經部獎助猪鬃蠶絲外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕中樞決心統一全國幣制，此項工作即將自調整東北流通券與法幣之比率及使用入手。據悉：政府為穩定東北流通券幣值，決許法蹩出關。此項措施財部主管方面已着手計劃，東北負責當局亦經研究，初步決定法蹩與流通券之比率為十比一。如此，東北流通券將以半關金（法幣與關金為廿比一流通券一元等於半元關金）之資態與法幣同樣使用於關內外，惟最後決定仍待張嘉璈親赴東北視察後。至整理台幣，新疆幣制，亦列入中樞改革幣制方案中，惟以需要尙非如東北之迫切，故進行有待。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕管理外滙新辦法頒布後，一部份金融界人士認為，當某一期間政府售出外滙多於收入外滙時，法幣回能太多，銀根緊縮，將影響商業行莊。現據財部負責人稱：此種情形容或有之，但最低限度於最近半年中不發生。因對於進口貨物，政府仍訂有限額，限制輸入，是以進口所需外滙數目不大，即以第三季輸入分配額總數而論，亦不過鉅，而同期內政府所收入之外滙，決可約略相等。至將來若有不平衡時，政府自有妥當應付辦法。</p>

<h3>社論　徴收財產捐的商權</h3>
<p>徵收一次財產捐亦稱建國特捐之說，盛傳已久；最近據報傳消息，財政部已擬就此項特捐之徵課方案，將提請全國經濟委員會，立法院，及參政會等機關商決後，卽成定案，公布施行。我們於得讀此一方案之後，誠不能不有一言。</p>
<p>首先我們所要指出的，如今國家當艱難之會，建國復興，動員戡亂，在在需款，而國家値長期抗戰之後，稅源枯竭，爲應付國家必要支出，政府自不得不廣籌增益國庫之方，一次徵收財產特捐，要亦不失爲一種理財之方。况在戰時，不免有投機牟利之徒，大發其財，遽成暴富。此項利用戰事因而致富之人，其所得旣由戰時環境而來，對國家，對人民，更應盡其應負之責任。他們在過去雖不乏捐獻的機會，如庫券公債的籌募，以及獻金的繳納，然而凡此種種，多出自動，並沒有一種强制性，因而也就很容易規避。因此，在這個時候，徵收一次財產捐這一舉措，在理論上，在原則上，實是一種應該値得舉國一致支持的辦法。德國及捷克當第一次世界大戰後，國內情形，特別是經濟情形，相當嚴重，亦曾採取相同的措施；如今我國所遭逢到的危難；十百倍於當時的戰後歐洲，此際而有財產特捐的徵收，不特爲增益國庫的一種理財政策，實亦具有深遠的社會作用，使社會的財富得以獻歸國用，間接達到平均財富的目的。</p>
<p>可是所謂財產捐，或一次徵收財產稅這一個名詞，實在不無考慮餘地。據財政部所擬的方案，其中關於原則的說明，有這樣的語句：『現時一般人所主張一次財產稅，並非普通財產稅，徵收財產所孳生之收益。財產收益可年年征課，而一次財產稅係以財產之本身爲對象，僅課一次。』從而可知所謂建國特捐，或一次財產稅，與一般之財產稅性質逈異。就其性質言，它實在不是一般財產捐，或財產稅（General　Prroperty　Tax），而是一種資本徵收（Capital　Levy　）。所以我們認爲「建國特捐」也許此較是一個更妥善的稱謂，否則就應該用「資本徵收」，或「資產徵收」，却不能使用財產捐或財產稅之類的稱謂。因爲此次所擬舉辦的徵課，據財政部所擬的方案，明不是財產稅，而以財產之本身爲對象，此卽從財產的本身中徵收若干部份，以一次爲限，是卽等於徵收資本或資產的某一部份。</p>
<p>旣然以資產的本身爲對象，我們認爲如何徵收此一特捐，關係就非常重要，中國的統計及官府紀錄，對於數字的不甚注重，由來已久。晚近此風雖已稍變，漸趨改善，然統計數字的不全可恃，似無可疑。因此，此際而欲爲此次資產或資本的徵收，在實際上，必將遭遇極大的困難。所以我們將如何征收此一特捐，必須出以極審愼的考慮。我們以爲此項特捐旣以財產的本身爲對象，則其徵收，自應以財產或資產爲對象。今財部所擬方案，以個人爲課稅主體，深恐此法如果採行，全國人民，特別是破落的世家大戶，必將騷擾不寗。此其結果，對於國庫的增益，或未必能有什麼多大的實效，而與平衡社會財富的目的，却相距或反更遼遠。</p>
<p>財部所擬的方案內云：『財產捐以個人所有財產總額之現値超過十億元以上者征課之，以個人爲徵課主體，而以下列財產爲課稅客體：（一）士地房屋，（二）存款外匯，公債股票，（三）黃金外幣，（四）國人在外國之動產不動產，（五）獨資或合夥經營之財產凈値，（六）私人所有之一切交通工具，（七）機械貨物。』此一規定，表面上看去，好像很光明正大，但在實際上，「國人在外國之動產不動產　，不特估計不易，其中必有很可注意的一部份，或已改用了外人的名義，且征收亦不免有事實上的困難。故此項條款，結果或勢將成爲具文。那末，所謂財產捐的主要納付人將爲誰呢？就是擁有土地房屋的人。此在內地，尤爲顯然。在我們廣大的內地，過去的世家門閥多擁有土地房屋：最近三十年來的社會變革，原有的世家大戶，大多早已抱殘守缺，自經抗戰，其能倖存者，已屬寥寥。因爲他們的財產是土地房屋，這些土地房屋旣難於出售，又難於抵押，轉營它業。所以他們所有的財產雖隨時價以增高，可是這頂多是帳面上的一種數字，論到他們的實際，也未必不窮、得可憐。如果徵收財產特捐的主體僅是這一些破落世家大戶，其結果不特恐國庫未能增裕，而人民勢將遭到了很大的滋擾。且更因爲有密報調查等種種規定，或更將招致奸宵的營私舞弊。是其結果，何堪設想！</p>
<p>因此，我們以爲財產特捐的徵收，旣以財產的本身爲對象，應該以財產本身爲主體，而不全以個人爲主體。銀行帳戶的往來，公司行號本身的資本，都足爲資產正碗估計的標準。與其向銀行工廠商號的股東征收財產捐，自不若直接向銀行工廠商號征收來得便捷而無可逃避。個人所有的資產，估計爲難，征收不易，而公司行號的資產却應該有帳册可稽，逃避小易。所以如果要征收財產捐，此在實際上實在是「資產徵收一，則我們認爲征收的主體應該不是個人，而是財產本身。</p>
<p>總之，財政捐的征收，不特在增益國庫，且在平衡社會財富；必須有財產者能够眞正獻出他們的財產以爲國用，然後纔能達到開征此項特捐的目的。我們希望政府在實施以前，能够審愼考慮，在施行以後，能够公平執行。</p>

<p>建設力壓倒硬皮壞力！　泰安刧後築新城　短短半個月內全部完成　　〔本報濟南十七日航訊〕十五月來，這在歷史上有名的寓有詩情畫意的寨安古城，已被共匪佔領過三次：第一次爲去年六月十日至今年三月卅一日，第二次爲今年四年廿六日至七月卅日，第三次爲七月七日至同月十三日。我爲了要了解這三經戰亂的刦後古城究已改變成怎樣一個面目，乃決定不計一切困難，完成對於該城的旅行。　　十二日淸晨八時，在綏區吳迪基張偉軍兩處長協助下，找到了一輛大卡車，但旣成行後，由于路面的坎坷不平，除了濟南　山一段或多或少鋪上了些石子勉可行車外，由崗山南向，幾乎全係土路，路面狹窄，坡度陡削，車行其間，形同跳舞，尤以若干橋樑，尚未完工，所經廿八道溪河，皆由河底掠水而過，如遇雨後，山洪爆發，洪水往往連人帶車，全部衝走，因此居然亦被列入國道的該路，在我所走渦半個中國的公路的記憶裏，實在是最壞的一條路。　　由濟南至泰安一百八十華里，走了五個半小時始到達，到泰安後，首先觸入眼簾的是火車站房舍千餘間已被破壞到無一完棟，殘垣斷壁，觸目皆是。城區部份，原以西南兩門破壞最烈，所有城垣，亦經撤毀。城西北隅岱廟·爲全城重要名勝，頭門凡五，正中曰正陽門，左右曰掖門，又左曰仰高門，又右曰見大門，院中左有宣和碑，右有祥符碑，二門曰仁安門，正殿曰峻極殿內祀東嶽大帝（即泰山之神）壁畫展拓工妙，後殿日寢殿，祀碧霞元君。峻極殿宋曰夭貺，明曰仁安，殿九間，重簷八角，覆以黃瓦，製作高峻，藻飾璨麗，志云：「其高僅次於故太和殿三尺」，丹墀之下，庭院宏敞，古柏數株如龍爪，枝幹修密，其一正當甬道，名曰「獨立大夫」。太湖石古餘塊，其一最怪特，名曰「扶桑石」。大小碑碣十數具，其一最壯麗，俗呼爲「駝龍碑」，高三丈餘，色澤甚美。其尤奇古者，爲「秦無字碑，」碑爲圓柱形，高達三丈，頂鐫華蓋，根刻龍紋，色黝黑，剝蝕已甚，相傳亦係「秦始皇舊物。」　　西院有環詠事，壁嵌李斯「泰山刻石」云「自岱項移嵌于此。」其後便殿，陳法器珍物，乾隆所頒「鎭圭」，昔存於此，今已秘藏，自泰安三失三得後，此寳已不知爲誰所存矣。環詠亭之南有唐槐（見照片）古幹中劈，一幹已拈，僅一幹尚發綠葉少許；東院有炳靈宮，宮前有漢柏六株，（見照片），老幹扶疏，傳爲漢武時植。　　岱廟原有城堞，週圍凡三里，高三丈，門凡八，共匪入侵時，迭被拆毀，堞內除峻極殿外，其餘殿宇，率多傾圯，返待整修，其中東嶽坊以南房舍，原已改爲中山市塲及民衆敎育館，今則殘敗零落不堪，已至無一商舖繼續營業。　　胡景瑗部進駐後，因鑒於過去城垣被撤，工事欠强，致匪集中大量兵力來攻時，輒無法困守，乃以該師積餘經費兩億元，另善後救濟總署所撥之救濟費六千萬元及麵粉一千五百袋，作爲拆除城四週一千零二間民房之補貼費用，由王耀武司令官規定瓦房每間貼補國幣廿五萬元，麵粉兩袋，草房十五萬元，麵粉一袋拆除後，即由縣府發動民伕萬餘人，協助重建泰安新城，同時爲鞏固泰安城防並將岱廟城堞又補築爲泰安內城，廟南正陽等四門全部砌設，僅留見大門一角作出入之用，而最令人興奮者，即居民因不堪共匪虐殺，由於生存慾之脅迫，多樂於自動奮起，協助國軍，興修城垣及工事，故所有內外兩城及工事在短短半月期間（至八月十日）即已全部工竣，允稱奇蹟，無怪胡師長景瓊語我：「憑此堅强工事，有二千地方團隊守此，亦毋慮一一一數十倍之匪圍攻矣，」　　居民因工事完成，料知此次國軍必有久守意，皆相率來歸，現已達三萬餘人，達戰前人口五份之二現城區保甲，已初編完成一，駐軍及縣府爲恐奸匪混跡城內一，妨害消安，特劃西門及南門外一爲商業區，尤以南門外大空塲最一爲熱鬧，每日商賈來此「趕集」一者，絡繹不絕，各以圓形布蓬高一懸空中，藉掩　陽，遠望猶如夏一季荷花，別饒風趣。因商業區移一設城外，致原係泰安最繁華之昇平街，反甚冷落。城區原有敎堂五，被毀其四，有中學七小學卅餘，亦大部被毀，即課桌檯椅，亦付缺如，縣府正策劃恢復，即席地上課，亦所不辭。縣府又鑒於幹部之重要，現正調訓鄉鎭保甲長及小學敎員三百餘人積極訓練，至自衛武力，自重建後，各區鄉合計，現已有步槍三千餘枝，機槍卅餘挺，　要做到「槍不離人，人不離鄉，鄉鄉連防，守望相助」，以達到無須仰賴正規軍即可自衛之目的。城區居民，原皆以河水作飲料，河水源出泰山山麓，分兩支沿山勢蜿蜒而下，水至平原，一往西關，一向東流，相背繞城，流入城內，後水源多處被匪堵塞，故居民飲水，頓成嚴重問題，胡景瑗部入駐後，經澈底疏導，本月十日，水一勢復流，居民稱便，咸對胡部，歌誦不止。　　李縣長光村於城垣二次淪陷時，嘗被匪俘捕達半月，後經一老嫗營救始得脫險逃出。李氏驅幹修長，貌頗似蔣主席，爲人公正廉明，耐勞刻苦，他於詳述他的被俘經過後一再强調：「假使我們自己不革命，那未人家就要革我們的命了」而我個人對於視察寨安後所得的感想是：「共匪破壞力誠足驚人，但政府的建設力量尤爲偉大，」這其中主要的契機非他，乃在一個是不得民心，一個是得民心，所謂順民者昌，逆民者亡，泰安新城能於短短半個月，全部究成，即爲一最有力佐證，而新城西門城樓之紅字大幅標語「勢如泰山，穩若金城」（「金城」係部隊代字）更予我以最深刻的不可磨滅的印象。（特派員麗天）蚌市奇聞　參議員賄選欠債　甲長公開索票錢　　〔本報蚌埠十八日訊〕蚌市首屆參議員之產生，頗爲與論界所不滿，如其中之阜陽人賈雁臣，即以行賄而遭人控告，地方法院訟事，迄今尚朱解決。最近渠又被國慶區淮泗保甲長張懷彬，朱元之等九人，登報公開向賈催索競選時應付之　資，大意謂賈於上次競選期間，率同淮泗保長陳良善到各甲，挨戶散放名片，允許每票代價五萬元，再三囑咐，此項　價，已得者現無問題，未得者催素甚急，此項　款是否陳良着中飽，抑係賈雁臣朱付，請於三日內答覆等語，選舉行賄，公開索討票資，誠屬奇聞，至賈雁臣如何應付，各方甚爲注意。蘇州閶外昨晨大火　　損失達十萬萬元　　〔本報蘇州廿日電〕蘇蘭外大馬路今晨四時許，發生大火災，宏發橡膠廠，華盛烟行，南京理髮廳，均付一炬，損失約十億元。據聞起火原因係火表走電。浙省決整頓棁務　廢除各地包稅制　　〔本報杭州二十電〕浙省財廳長今日語記者，今後省財政決整頓稅務，廢除各地包稅制度，嚴厲執行依照稅則征收，以豐省庫。又本省廿八縣田賦改行折幣後，除省縣公糧與積穀仍征實外，如經縣參議會通過，為解除縣財政困難，可將縣府應得之五成田賦，仍征實物。浙選舉事務所　昨開二次會議　　選舉人名冊展期造報　　〔本報杭州廿日電〕浙省選舉事務所今開二次會議，因總所頒行各項法令過遲，故決將各縣市應行造具之選舉人名册，自八月廿六日展期至九月五日以前造報。至全國性之職業團體及婦女團體選舉人名册，則由該所於九月十日前依例造報。蘇參議會第三日　整日分組討論各案　下午舉行臨時會議　　〔本報蘇州廿日電〕蘇參議會二次大會，今爲第三日，根據議程，原係整日小組審查會議，共分七組討論，惟因收租總處沈愷貪汚案及兵役配額問題，特於下午二時至四時舉行臨時會議，出席議員八十七名，沈愷案由縣府財政科長兪作人及軍法承審員携案卷到會，答復質詢，各參議員認爲事經縣軍法室月餘偵查，尚未終結，應請速移地檢處。茲經兪科長答應該案係縣府發動檢舉，故交軍法偵查，爲求盡調查之能事，故迄未終結等語，當由大會決定，請縣將該案速移地檢處偵查，會塲情緒始見緩和。次及兵役配額問題因杜司令赴滬未返，故經大會決定，先由各鄉區參議員組小組討諭會，俟杜司令返蘇後，再行商討。臨時會議後續開小組審查，迄七時散會，明日議程爲討論提案。濟南大觀園　發生妬殺案　利斧之下　命薄如紙　吳麗紅受務　蔣銘自殺未成　　〔濟南十七日訊〕濟南唯一繁華市塲大觀園內中央咖啡店，十七日上午十一時，發生謀殺案，姘夫蔣銘曾充中國劇團團員，（鄭重，陳　雲所領導）姘婦係一名花，二度從良之少婦吳麗紅，現改名巧鈴），該妹生於上海，長於濟南，現年廿四歲。蔣用利斧向吳麗紅頭部亂砍十六斧後，企圖自殺未成，一時血流滿地，大觀園內中央咖啡館門前人羣擁擠不堪，迨警察趕到，一面車送蔣吳二人到省立醫院急治，一面報告上級。事後，記者趕到醫院，吳巧鈴住第二病房廿七號病室，頭部已全行包紮，鮮血猶涔涔透於布外，面容慘白，神志昏迷，囈語不止。蔣銘住第三病房卅二號，頭部亦經包紥，精神尚淸楚。十七日下午四時許，曾就病榻進食，記者訪問時則瞠目緘口，假裝　塗。據醫院外科醫生日人日比野稱：吳巧鈴頭部頸項各部，共受斧砍十六處，內有七八處深及骨髓，蔣銘頭部有傷七處，亦有傷及骨髓者，如不化膿，或不致有生命危險。郭順案傳說紛紜　蘇高檢處決澈查　　〔蘇州訊〕此間蘇報及蘇州明報揭載滬永安紡織公司郭順漢奸嫌疑案，謂經具名讀者李仁秋函稱，略謂：「蘇高檢處已疏通，可予不起訴處分，而蘇新聞界亦由某報駐蘇特派員出面拉攏，賄賂每報社五千萬元，每通訊社四千萬元」一節；記者特趨訪蘇高檢處首席韓　及外埠駐蘇記者協會籌備委員會探詢意見，承韓首席告稱：「該案尚在偵查期中，後果如何，現時固難懸揣，惟檢察處爲國家執法機構，應有其尊嚴，此項無眞實姓名地址不負責任文件之散佈及揭載，事前毫不加以翔實之調查，實屬特堪痛心，本處閡將依法澈查，以明究竟」等語，繼幷承駐蘇記者協會籌委會方面表示，略稱：「該項文件之揭載，牽涉駐蘇記者聲譽。本籌委會極盼能披露具體事實，加以法律檢舉，否則，當根據出版法依法訴究，以明責任」。　　〔本報張家口十五日訊〕冀中牲畜，多在戰火中損失，農業生產，全靠人力，這一家父子三人，正牽引着犁耙播種。（竭忠攝寄）岱廟工鏡頭　（上）岱廟橫剖面（下）岱廟唐槐。（右爲胡師長景瑗，左爲本報記者）。本報特派員麗天寄。　　岱廟漢柏雄姿　（本報特派員　天寄）袖診新聞　　紹興　　〔本報訊〕紹興陶　，龍會，稽東，　西，蘭亭，漓渚等鄉，已開始實施淸鄉，預定一月內完成。〔又訊〕錢淸外沙鹽民三萬餘入，要求　塲加價，塲公署以物價回跌，不予答允，鹽民以生活有關，已全體怠工，省方正派員調解中。　　餘姚　　〔本報訊〕菴東鹽塲鹽民前因核减鹽價，拖欠鹽價而發生之拒繳產　風潮，僵持已多日，雖經塲公署飭各倉長分頭勸繳，結果鹽民繳鹽者仍屬寥寥。日前西二區（大雲鄉）塲務所主任沈以志以鹽民久未繳鹽，派大批稅警會同該地倉長雇員將張家路水路灣一帶　民家中存　，悉數對存騐印，强迫鹽民繳鹽，事後鹽民湧至西二塲務所及菴東鹽業工會請願，情緒頗爲激昻。　　衢州　　〔本報訊〕本縣奉撥美國菜種，業經縣農業推廣所向專署具領到縣，計有玉米，胡瓜，番茄，四季菜，甘藍，甜碗荳，洋葱，菠菜，蘿葡，胡蘿蔔等十一種，共一千六百八十餘斤，縣府除已派員下鄉辦理菜種登記外，將於十六日訂定配發辦法　　蘭谿　　〔本報訊〕溪西一帶竊殼風盛，每當夜深人靜，竊賊乘機潛入稻田中，竊割新穀，糾紛迭起，警局溪西分駐所爲嚴密防範計，已派警在夜間巡邏。　　崑山　　〔本報訊〕角直鎭附近北塘村，十七日深夜，突遭匪徒十餘人搜劫全村，財物損失不貲，鄉民張水根等兩人，同遭殺斃。　　無錫　　〔本報訊〕縣屬東亨區九里鄉大房巷居民徐錫均，年二十四歲，在敵僞時充當東亭警備隊密探，並搶刦楊亭五美堂諸阿榮家鉅款，最近因騙取鄰居徐祖泉家飾物，被該鎭自衛隊拘獲，十九日呈解縣府訊押。　　江陰　　本報十八日電稱卿民丁進資玩弄自衛隊步槍走火，將永和顏料店司賬張阿濤擊傷，「傷」字誤爲「斃」字，合行更正。　　閔行　　〔本報訊〕上海縣稅捐稽征處舞弊案，經縣府縣參議會呈請省方澈查後，茲悉省財廳已將主任嚴民華撤職查辦，並令淸查賬目，縣府現已着手淸理。臨浦麻溪　六月雪　　〔臨浦十五日訊〕十四日下午三時二十分，臨浦麻溪魯家村地方，在烈日之下，驟來一朶黑雲，由該村東北而來，繼之則降微雪。該雪花朶不大，色呈淡黃，村人為之驚駭不止。</p>

<p>第一二兩季限額輸入　橡膠毛紡等公會要求　仍按官價結匯　　工協亦將向政府提出四項建議　　第一區橡膠工業同業公會，上海市毛羢紡織工業同業公會，第四區絲織工業同業公會，全國水泥工業同業公會，第四區麵粉工業同業公會，第六區造紙工業同業公會，上海市草呢帽工業同業公會，上海市駱駝絨工業同業公會，上海市製藥工業同業公會，第四區肥皂工業同業公會等爲要求第一·二兩季限額輸入物資，仍按官價結滙，昨特聯名其呈輸出入管理委員會，略謂新訂進出口貿易辦法，業奉政府明令公布，考其功能，不僅可推廣輸出，吸收僑滙，藉使國際收支漸趨平衡。如能運用得宜，尤足以增加生產器材與必要原料之輸入。凡吾工業界同人，自當一體擁獲。惟查新辦法規定，嗣後限額輸入之物資，除少數日用必需品外，亦須按照市價，向指定銀行申請結購必要之外滙。日前財政部徐次長在招待記者席上，對於第三季限額原料結滙問題，亦會有此明白宣示。年來各業飽受原料材料短絀之痛苦，成本之所以增高，生產之所以萎縮，多由於此。猶幸其中一小部份物資，尚能以限額輸入方式，勉供需用。生產方面，差塲暫維不輟，日後原材料輸入數量，萬一仍難增加，而其價格則須改依外匯市價結算，製造成本，旣告激增，遙瞻前途，實多悚懼。而各業最引爲深憂者，橡膠毛紡製帽駱駝絨造紙各業所得第二季原料限額，水泥麵粉各業所得第二季蔴袋限額，絲織業所得第一·二兩季人造絲限額，雖奉限價分配處分別核定在案，但因種種關係，或僅少數已結外滙，或竟全部未有着落，若須一律按照新訂辦法辦理，影響所及，何堪設想，故特懇請將第一第二兩季輸入限額，仍照官價結滙，並轉令有關各銀行遵照辦理，以維工業而挽艱危云云　　又訊，自從政府公佈修正外滙辦法後，記者走訪上海市工業協會負責人，詢問工業界之意見。據稱：上海各工業界對此次辦法，將向政府建議下列各點：　　一，請政府轉飭公佈第一季限額輸入分配情形，工業界配得若干，進口商與販賣商配得若干，以便社會各界可以明瞭。　　二，請政府將第一·二兩季限額原料，尚未配給者，應仍以修正辦法公佈前之官價一萬二千元結滙。其理由以第一·二兩季限額，係屬於二·三·四·五·六·七·六個月，在修正辦法公佈前之限額。其次爲第一·二兩季限額一部份早經進口商與販賣商申請結滙，工業界以要求各工業之需用原料，加以統計審核，協議分配，致未能如期申請，而一部已送入之申請書，亦被限額分配處延擱，未能結滙，故建議仍以官價結滙，以示公允。　　三，請政府取銷限額分配辦法，以新辦法實行後，政府可硬性規定何者准予輸入，何者禁止輸入，其有利於增加國內生產之工業必需而無法獲得代替之原料，應儘量獎勵輸入，增加生產即可設法輸出可再獲取外滙，故原料限額輸入一節，應請取銷。　　四，政府公佈之棉花，米，麥，麵粉，煤焦，煤等可以官價結滙之物資，應明白規定國營，或民營。如係國營亦不必規定官價結滙辦法，如屬民營，如政府不能切實管制是項物資之價格，亦應按市價結滙，以免授少數商人以獲取過份利得之機會。　　關於上述各點，該會將在常務理事會通過後，呈請政府採納。利賣空氣甚濃　華股盤旋略振　　華股昨盤旋不定，永紗以大部份多頭繼續加碼，人心雖感恐慌，仍得被動拉上。小型股華豐搪瓷，在貸款消息下，遞交由二二〇號興業銀行力納，即交由一七一號奮購，過程最見堅定。證券帮大戶加碼意濃，關金大票及金鈔流言又多，買方佔優，塲外息價開低至一角〇五及一角半，趨勢有重振之可能。　　晨開承前收餘風，開出見昻，遞永紗開後，一一七號六五號有買而見穩，二二三號一四號二三五號趁高供給，退至二二四元。九四號二〇七號二三五號一六三號一五四號七六號進胃仍股，升爲二三三元。二二四號二一九號脫手，跌至二二八元。二三六號三六號二二三號仍購，一六三號力購現永紗。　　十時半，塲外息價開低至一角〇五，及一角半，（亦有一角二，及一角六分半者），買氣見蘇，盤漲到二三四元，散買仍見猶豫，經八五號二一九號二八號一六〇號三六號七六號脫手，十一時後，又復盤低至二二五元低價。此時各股雖疲，華豐獨告堅定，塲內由一七一號力購現華豐，二二〇號浙興奮納遞華豐，不跌反漲。十一時半後，一一六號一八五號一一七號趁低購買，仍易拉上。　　午收永紗以二三〇元之價結束，收後喊價微挫，華豐則以高價收市。結果較前收即交股計永紗華豐榮豐各漲半成，中紡美亞中一絲新光永公景福微升，景綸麗華新華小挫，餘股均平。遞交股計永紗漲半成弱，新光微挫，華豐永公景福美亞微升。塲外各老股計冠生園新新各升半成，餘股升沉均微。統債外股平庸　　公債昨統戊續告微升，餘債僅告微挫。統丙晨開一三二〇〇元，高價一三三〇〇元，低價一二五〇〇元，而後稍定。三六〇室五五五室有納，五五二室五〇三室則出，結果較前收計甲乙低三〇〇元，統丙跌二〇〇元，統丁祗挫一〇〇元，統戊微升一〇〇元，成交七百餘萬。　　外股昨榮辱不一，形勢十分平庸，起仆甚微。銀行帮吸收業廣，廣帮略扒，證券帮及洋商均售。怕紗開價八七五〇〇元，十分平和，結果較前收計怡紗會德豐航業電話祥泰微升，業廣紙業怕啤鋼業微挫，英聯平平。收兌美鈔價格　日內即可確定　　〔本報訊〕此次政府改訂結滙辦法，對美鈔收兌價格，迄無明文規定。茲據某權威人士告記者，此事正由中央銀行向當局請示中，日內可有確切指示，將來可能由中央銀行集中收兌。記者昨曾向國行原委託代兌美鈔之銀行詢問，據談：在未奉指示前，如有特鈔求兌者，則仍照官價收兌云。匯率改訂後　大豆輸出樂觀　　〔中央社瀋陽二十日電〕外滙及從出口貿易辦法改訂後，此間客商至感興奮，東北對外輸出最主要之大豆，目前尚有行無市，一般商人均抱看漲心情，多不願立刻脫手。今日大豆市價已由每斤百七十五元漲至二百元。　　〔本報福州二十日電〕管制外滙及進出口貿易修正辦法公佈後，榕厦兩地市塲反應甚佳。出口中特產商，如茶漆器木書等，皆抱樂觀態度。外滙黑市公開後，厦僑滙將可疏暢，逃港之風常可稍戢。據報告，近半年來，厦國行經收僑滙僅六十餘億元，而逃港者達（一三六〇）餘萬美元之鉅貨不絕，修削三五千元。陳豆中次油廠揀巧納取，亦低三五千元。菉豆南洋問津較殷，蠶豆客消淸淡，本街銷路依然冷懈。莞豆汕頭續購，市面活絡。行總停配原棉　　行總供給各紗廠原棉，現將淸理前賬，暫停配售，聞其原因大要爲：（一）以前配出原棉與收回棉紗一成，迄未獲得解決。（二）第二次行總續到外棉，因存量關係，一時朱能盡配。（三）外埠小型紗廠核配困難，懸案未決，必須先行解決後再行續記。紡調會完成管理機構後　紗布管制即可撤消　　新調節方案經部已核准　　〔本報訊〕紡調會劉代主委泗英昨談稱：一俟該會廣州天津及漢口三區辦事處成立，及其附屬之紗布公棧設立後，紗布南北運管制，即可撤銷。將來運往華南華北各地之紗布，均將繳存各該地公棧內，再由該公棧負責銷售附近各地，亦須由進口地政府證明，呈請我政府特准後，再由紗布公棧予以出口。聞該三區辦事處，正積極籌備中。又廣州辦事處轄粤桂閩三省，天津辦事處轄冀魯豫三省，漢口辦事處轄鄂湘贛三省紗布供銷事宜。　　〔又訊〕關於發展紡織事業，調節紗布供應實施新方案，據紡調會劉代主委稱：已由經部核准，呈政院作最後決定，日內可望公布實施。按該方案之修正，頗多採納六區棉紡公會之意見。故深信將來該方案實施時，不致有何困難。方案中對國棉將採聯合收購政策，即由紡調會六區公會及舫建公司聯合向產區收購原棉後，將來按照各廠實際需要量，予以分配。若有餘多，再由紡調會分配未參加收購之廠家。該項國棉之產紗，紗廠可自由配銷，惟必須依照紡調會所定之議價出售。配銷對象，必爲紡調會所諷可之複製廠商。且配售種類及數量，須逐月報告紡調會備考。至於外棉部份，則採代紡代織政策　　〔又訊〕第六區棉紡公會，鑒於日本對外貿易，業經開放，紗布已大量運銷南洋谷地，而我國紗布輸出，除紡建公司奉令辦理外銷外，民營紗廠方面，紗布仍禁止出口，故決定於明日紡調會例會中，提出商討。同時並擬呈請國行張總裁，希望際此日本對外貿易開放之初，其國內生產尚感稀少時，我國趁此時期，大量出口，藉以爭取南洋市塲，免被人操縱，且亦可配合當局之貿易政策，獲取外滙頭寸，平衡國際收支云。食米先疲後定　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧三千七百餘石，市况先疲後定，結果粳秈米盤小三五千元，白元新粳平疲之狀。蘇嘉綫及南京溧陽等處新秈續有到申，而當局計劃出售米糧，即將實現，是以後情未許樂觀。　　麵粉廠方堅挺，微升千元，雜牌上落狹隘，統粉亦加一二千元。麩皮實銷甚懈，豆餅台灣成交一千張，市氣轉活，黃豆長江來票據交換所將實行　分組直接交換法　　俟場所佈置完竣卽可實現　　〔本報訊〕本市票據交換所近爲外界建議「禁止蔡據抵現與加辦第二次交換」事，特召開常務委員會，提出討論，決議要點如次：（一）工商業當日存入票據，多在十時半之後，十二時之前。如第一次交換於上午十一時或以前舉行，則大部當日應收票據，將不能軋進第一次交換。（二）第一次交換與第二次交換之時間，距離至少須有三小時半或須五小時。如第一次交換爲上午十一時，則第二次交換須在二時半或四時，而當日淸算工作之全部終了時間，將在九時或十時半。惟現時一般意見，僉以爲下午二時之將換時間，殆無法再予延遲。（三）增辦一次交換後，第一次交換票據之付款與否，至第二次交換時，在事實上是否可以絕對確定，仍須視兩次交換後之交換差額，是否分兩次補足。（四）最近經本所多數同業主張，決改採全體分組直接交換辦法，俟塲所佈置就緒，即付賓行。惟交換單位共二百餘，如實施伊始，再增加交換一次，勢將引起技術上之混亂。（五）紐約交換所與倫敦交換所之晨間交換，其標據為：一，外埠票據，及二，隔日所收之本市票據。倫敦交換所直接參加交換者僅有七個單位，均非吾國所能仿行。（六）票據交換實務有如整個之機器，一部份之變更，非就全部設計，不能實施云云。外匯市價　昨仍不變　　〔本報訊〕外滙市價，昨經平衡基金委員會核定，仍維持原價，故滙市始終平穩。昨日各指定銀行購進出口商外滙，已較日前增加，進口結滙仍少。中央銀行昨已將外滙買賣日報，分送各指定銀行，各行已遵照逐日塡報，並將當日結餘外滙，售予平衡委會，不足則向平衡委會補進。請求核減入絲配價　已獲解決辦法　　協議按照市價八折計算　　〔本報訊〕滬杭蘇盛各地絲織業織帶業，請求中信局核减人造絲配價一事，昨已獲得臨時解決。昨日上午十一時許，絲織織帶業代表蔡昕濤劉慶一等十人，再赴中信局與該局吳局長及易貨處負責人洽談一過，最後協議兩點：（一）八月份一二三三週，照各該前週當時市價，暫按八折照數補發。並限十天內交款提貨，逾期取消。（外埠限期，以貨到通知公會之日起算）。（二）中信局說明配價最低减額爲照市價八折，係行政院所規定。如欲再行减低，須向行政院申請。如獲批准低於八折，則中信局現將多收款項退還廠方。　　聞三週配絲總額，約在一千六百箱左右。如照市價八折計算，第一週約爲二〇〇八萬元，第二三兩週約爲一九八四萬元。現絲微織帶兩業代表，擬定今日往訪吳市長，吳社會局長，要求協助向政院請求核减配價云。八月十七日以後　未領得輸入許可證者　不得向國外定貨　輸出入管委會二次會議決定　　〔本報訊〕輸出入管理委員會，於廿日中午十二時，舉行二次會議，由主委張嘉璈主席，迄下午二時半始散。對未經領得輸入許可證，已到埠及已起運之貨品，依照進出口貿易辦法第九條之規定，訂定下列辦法處理之二　　（一）在三十六年八月十七日以後，在未領得輸入許可證以前，不得向國外洽辦訂購貨品手續，若擅將貨品啓運到達本國口岸者，該項貨品，應一律强迫運離口岸或由政府定價並按照外滙官價收購，如收貨人爲本會登記合格之進口商或廠商，其登記資格應予撤銷，（二）在三十六年八月十六日以前到埠貨品而未取得轍入許可證者，及確能證明在八月十六日以前已經起運在途之貨品而未取得輸入許可證，應向該會秘書處登記科登記，其業經向限額分配處及非限額審核處遞呈審請許可證書者，一律由申請人收回，此項登記限於八月三十一日截止，上列所開登記貨品之處置辦法，由該會另訂公布。</p>

<p>出版界周刊「我選擇了自由」序  潘公展　　勒宣譯　上海民治出版社印行　　原始的材料，最爲史家所珍視，因爲是親身的經歷，而非捕風捉影之談。「我選擇了自由」一書之可貴，也就在這一點。這是一篇自述，作者爲蘇聯購料委員會駐美代表克拉夫靑科，自述其個人的身世和生活，投身共產主義的經過，以及奉派至美，思想改變的原因。這不是第三者的間接記載，而是一件件親身經歷過來的事實，「譬如飲水，冷暖自知」，在文獻中當然最爲可靠，何况作者原是個共產主義者，爲主義而主義的信徒。他加入共產黨，全出於一片熱忱，甚至於不顧他父親的勸告——他父親也是偶老革命黨，但痛恨共產黨的所作所爲，不能合他的理想。後來作者又毅然脫離了共產黨，不顧殺身之禍，情願做個亡命異國的流浪者。而其時他是黨的中堅份子，統治階級的一員，前途正無限量。這個思想上的大轉變，祗有讀過他那篇自述的，才知道這裏面有種種事實上的依據。他所說的話，出於至誠，是信而有徽的。　　科學家勸人多用兩目，少用兩耳，「耳食」之談，不可輕信。培根說得好：「世界爲思想所桎梏住，而思想又爲言語所桎梏住了」。洛克也曾說過；「人們都喜歡用他人所用的字面，覺得滿意，好像這些一字面的本身，有固定的意義似的」。却不知有好多話，只圖說着好聰，聽着好玩，心裏舒服，並無固定的意義。「自由」和「民主」都是很好聽的名詞，大多數還不是人云亦云，說着好聽，聽着好玩嗎？作者在他的自跋中說：「我們蘇聯人民，連一點最少限度的經濟和政治上的自由都不曾有，却要人相信這我們這組織中，也有一種所謂自由，所謂民主，似乎與向來所謂民主，有點不同」。這是多麽沉痛的一句話！作者在國內時，四周全給密探包圍着，他的言語，他的行動，他的思想，他的靈魂，無一不受人監視。等到他到了美國，又親眼看見這些自由自在，無拘無束的所謂「沒落」的資本國家人民。他才明白他所要的自由，不是那一種而是這一種，而決定了最後的出奔。他說他脫離的原因，不是偶然的，而是長期考慮的結果。他又說：「我要詳詳細細，坦坦白白，切切　實寫出來給人看。這是我的責任。蘇聯人民不能把他們的意見，他們的希望、說給人知道，所以我要揭破一切，警告人們，勿再自欺欺人」。這幾句話，正可作爲一般貴耳賤目者的當頭棒喝。　　勞工政權，集體農塲，五年計劃之類，我們都已耳熟能詳了。誰又想像得到所謂勞工政權的後面，仍是壓榨和奴役，其痛苦反十倍於沙皇時代？誰又想像得到所謂集體農塲的後面，却是一大篇的血帳——飢饉和恐怖？誰又想像得到所謂五年計劃中的天文數字，是這樣製造出來的？美國年來很關心蘇聯，調查硏究，出版的書也眞不少。但他們所看到釣，只是外表而不是眞相。作者曾說：「我出國時，曾領到兩本異常機密的小册子，警告我們須留意資本主義者，逢到他們問及蘇聯國內情形時，應該守口如瓶」。所以，硏究蘇聯的書雖多，大都只是「皮相」之談，讀後仍在五里霧中。無怪此書在美出版之後，要轟動一時，不脛而走了。　　這本名著，經勤宣君譯爲中文，信而能達，可說是一部好書。我們要平心靜氣地去讀這本書，不存絲毫偏見。事實俱在，請閱本文。克拉夫靑科的中譯本  晉善　　第二次世界大戰以後，世人對於蘇聯的認識，愈感興趣。但關於蘇聯的著作很少；其足跡曾履蘇俄的外國作者，也往往一鱗半爪，僅窺皮毛；見仁見智，未能遽定爲信史。那末要知道蘇聯目革命以至今日的情形，民間的疾苦，政治的動向，秘密警察制度的嚴厲，以及克萊姆林宮的內幕，其道何由？曰試閱克拉夫靑科所著的「我選擇了自由」。　　此書之所以認爲翔實可靠的原因，就是因爲克氏本人是個共產黨員。他這本自傳，是用自己的歷史爲經，而以當時蘇聯的環境爲緯。固然，別的作家也許因主觀的不同，對於蘇聯政治，有所曲解；但這樣一位生長於革命怒潮之中，完全受蘇維埃敎育和共產思想灌溉的，蘇俄工人的兒子的供狀；假使說是不準確，而再要找更忠實的文獻，那簡直是不可能了。　　書中說：克拉夫靑科是個狂熱的靑年黨員，標準的工人，所以終於被選爲優秀份子，保送至聶伯洛貝屈洛夫斯克學院，專攻冶金，畢業後，歷任各大冶金工廠的工程師，並且担任過俄羅斯共和國聯盟的人民委員會中的要職。在一個個然的巧遇中，他居然得到了他所日夜心嚮往之的出國機會，那就是他最後奉派到駐美購料委員會中去辦事，而由於窺破了蘇聯常局的愚民政策，秘密警察的毒辣手腕，一向鬱積在胸中厭惡政府思想，一發而不可復收，加以初受到民主和自由的陽光的煦拂，他毅然決然，拋棄了過去的一切「選擇了自由」，脫離祖國。同時蘇俄國內，網羅嚴密，批評政府的思想，是無從發表的。外間人士，對於這鐵幕的內部，時常憧憬着一種美夢，他早想以身受者的資格，大聲疾呼地把它揭開。這部書的完成，也可以說償了他的夙願。　　此書係用俄文寫成，英譯本曾由作者親自校閱，意義精確，文字流利，列爲美國一九四六年的暢銷書之一。全書共分二十八章，第一章至第六章，係作者少年時代的生活，第七章起，所述爲工廠的腐敗，集體化農塲中人民的痛苦，革命後的大飢饉，一再的淸黨，作者本人在此時期內所受的困厄；旁及秘密警察的狡詭和兇暴，奴役制度的造成，黨史的杜撰，對德戰爭時的眞相，執政者的個性和兩副面具。其中以「伊麗娜的秘密」和「兩種眞理」兩章，寫得最爲淋漓盡致。　　此書由勤宣君　譯爲中文，上海民治出版社發行。全書計五十萬言，全部訂成一大册，無割裂删節之弊。課筆忠實，語氣字眼，都遵作者原意，是其一長。此書可作爲自傳讀，也可作爲一九〇五年來蘇聯現代史讀。志摩日記  陳從周　　（徐志摩遺作，陸小曼輯，最光魯局出版）　　志摩日記出版到現在，已將半載，這位死去將近二十年的詩人，因爲這日記的出來，又重新浮上人們的腦海間，從硤石鎭（作者故鄉）上來人說，居然也有不少人爭購着，可見人們還不十分健忘罷！　　我曾經說過，與其說志摩是詩人，是新詩運動的主幹，倒不如更進一步地說，他的一身就是一首極優美的詩，他的一身正如他詩上說的「我匆匆地去，正似我匆匆地來，我揮一揮我的衣袖，不帶去一片的雲彩。」這樣匆匆地結束了三十六年的詩人生活，飄飄然莫知所終。其一生中足以耐人尋味的地方很多，這書是片段的日記，計未印過的有西湖記，眉軒瑣語，一本沒有顏色的書，其他愛眉小扎等已早在十年前良友書店印過的，姑不重述了，前二者是日記，後者是太戈爾胡適之所贈書魚詩詞，尚有作者與友朋照片用原稿製版，頗爲可玩。日記中的文字都記載着作者生活的一斑，差不多全是信手寫來，本不有意發表，因此非常眞摯，自然，如交友，私生活，以及內心痛苦思想與行動矛盾的地方，在平時不願知道的，都寫了出來，看這本日記，不啻親與作者暢譚，至於文筆之美，又是餘事了！尤其承平之世，留戀詩酒，暢遊南北，不能不爲之神往，書中所記人很多，如今檢點，只存一半，存者有的騰達，有的沉淪，不禁感慨係之，余妻定（徐的表妹）讀到「他們的口舌原來姑丈只比作他家裏海棠樹上的雀噪。」（西湖記）時，掩中而泣，如今作者已矣！岳父已矣！她家海棠樹又已矣！如何不敎人惘然呢？我細讀是書覺有數點可待存商之處，茲略舉於後，也許編輯人一時的疏忽罷！　　（一）小曼序上說：「飛一般的日子帶去了整整的十個年頭兒，志摩也變了五十歲的人了。」按志摩生於淸光緒二十二年丙申（一八九六）十二月十三日，死於民國二十年辛未（一九三一）十月十日，年三十六。依舊曆計算今年應作五十二歲，小曼大約從陽曆。　　（二）小曼序上說：「其他日記倒還有幾本，可惜不在我處，別人不肯拿出來，我亦沒有辦法，不然倒可以比這幾本精彩得多。」爲了此事，我曾去範園問過如孫母子據說沒有，依我所知，作者書稿隨處散失，再加丁丑之刦硤石老家爲之蕩然的緣故。　　（三）西湖記注明自一九一八年九月七日——十月廿八日。按記中所載祖母回神及回國周年紀念，明明是民國十二年一九二三的事，故所註年份應更正才是。　　（四）眉軒瑣記注明自一九二六年八月——一九二七年四月，按文中「淸明日早車回硤，下午去蔣姑母家，次晨早四時復去送除韓。」定告我，先岳於民十五（一九二六）去世，第三年民十七即一九二八春除幃，志摩與舅父同來，決非一九二七年事，原本上記年不知如何寫，以我在本　上的證明，大約眉軒瑣語三個月便結束了，編輯人將再次一年的日記賡續了，所以有此誤，我的理由是作者自己在書上說「這本日記即使每天寫，也怕至少三個月才寫得滿。」三個月也許寫不滿，遂隔了一年再　續在這本日記簿上的，亦未必可知。　　以上幾點，本無關緊要，有考據癖的我，恐怕將來有人要根據此日記爲志摩作編年的東西而致誤，因此多事地曉曉一番。（右圖：民廿九年四月徐志摩與泰谷爾合影）「我選擇了自由」中譯本目錄　　第一章　晚上的逃亡　　第二章　在俄羅斯的童年時代　　第三章　光榮與飢餓　　第四章　在共產黨中的靑年時代　　第五章　和過去分裂　　第六章　卡庫夫的一個學生　　第七章　機器的勝利　　第八章　農村的恐怖　　第九章　地獄內的收獲、　　第十章　我遇到了第一次淸黨　　第十一章　伊麗娜的秘密　　第十二章　尼古泊爾的工程師　　第十三章　快些！快些！　　第十四章　大淸黨時期　　第十五章　我的苦難開始了　　第十六章　正義的尋求　　第十七章　夜半的拷打　　第十八章　自由的與奴隸式的勞工　　第十九章　當歷史在重編的時候　　第二十章　西伯利亞的詭計、　　第二十一章　當歐洲在作戰的時候　　第二十二章　意想不到的戰爭　　第二十三章　莫斯科的恐慌　　第二十四章　戰時的克來姆林宮　　第二十五章　兩種眞理　　第二十六章　到美國去的前奏　　第二十七章　史太林的海外部屬　　第二十八章　因不公平而出亡羅曼羅蘭的「白利與露西」  若非　　一生致力於非戰工作的羅曼羅蘭，無論什麼時候都不會忘記自己所服膺的哲理。「白利與露西」是一部抒寫少男少女戀愛塲面的抒情詩，以第一次歐戰爲背景，在戰火的籠單下人類日漸接近死亡，但在同時，巴黎的一角發生了一幕戀愛悲劇。一對相互傾慕的靑年，欲無視這人間的死亡的陰影，欲逃避到心靈深處作純潔的享受，可是一聲巨響，幾次爆炸，他們相互擁抱着默默死去了。　　我們很熟悉羅曼羅蘭的筆調，三個大革命戲曲「七月十四日」，「愛與死的搏鬥」等，有着令人驚看贊歎的如火如茶的塲面。他的書和他的名字一樣，駭起來就會呌我們激動。在他的熱情的篇幅中，有着那麽多的哲理的說敎，但又是通過了作者的藝術手腕的哲理的說敎，因此除了接受作者的說敎外，我們沒有第二條路。　　「戰鬥的人巡主義」，這是羅曼羅蘭揭發的一個標的；「新的英雄主義」，這又是羅曼羅蘭一生所崇敬的對象。在他的七十多歲的一生中，我們便看出了他實在是這兩種哲理的化身，這兩種宣誓的活的具體說明。　　一九〇四年，羅曼羅蘭寫了長篇「約翰，克利斯朶夫」的第一卷：「黎明」，他的名字便震動了世界；「白利與露西」則是飽在一九一八年所寫的。一九一四年歡戰爆發，他目擊全世界已被呑入戰火中，到處是殘酷的屠殺，他於是站在超民族超國家的立塲，發表了不少反戰的文章，這使他幾乎成爲「國家的罪人」了。人類多半短視，易卜生在一國民公敵」中便敍述了這一點，但眞理愈辨愈明，唯大勇者，他決不輕易屈服，後來終於證明了羅曼羅蘭的偉大。「白利與露西」可以說是他的非攻的哲學，雖然用的是形象手法。　　我們從「白利與露西」一書，可以蠡測羅曼羅蘭的胸懷。那時候由於他的反戰，他成了一國民公敵」，內心的寂寞和痛苦可想而知。但一個一往情深的人，除非事先他不崇敬那眞理，不信仰那眞理，否則他就貫徹到底。天下大藝人，大哲人！一切的大勇者，都是一往情深的人，除非最初不服膺，要是服膺了，他們便爲他們所服膺人或哲理戰鬥到死。羅曼羅蘭也許是寂寞的吧，可是他更執着，更堅强，他在痛苦中鍛鍊他目己，也就使他產生了「白利與露西」的著作。　　使我們奇怪的是：（一）在「白利與露西」中，沒有作者的憤怒誇張的激辯，却只有平靜執着的說服。他的活像潺潺流水，那麽平易，又那麼自然，而且一當你發覺他所說的是眞理後，他的平靜和你的激動，恰巧是一個對照；（二）在「白利與露西」中，作者運用了最細膩的筆調，來刻劃一對少男少女的初戀。巴黎的一角，那不知名的橋下，那頽牆邊，不會由於他倆的情話喁喁，使我們對巴黎更神往起來了嗎，從「白利與露西」，我們很容易想到屠格湼夫描寫愛情的若干塲面，然而前者筆調的簡潔明麗，有時更超過了後者。痛苦寂寞中的羅曼羅蘭還能運用匠心，創造出這麽一對初戀中的人物，這是不可相像的。　　書中有最美的描寫，恰像最美的詩篇一樣美，這裏只能摘錄一節：　　「他們的臉彼此吻着。兩點乘此機會，從寄　的傘下用他的手指刷着他們的頭髮同他們的臉；在他們的唇間，他們吸着了一滴冷水。　　讓我們再看一看，他們是怎樣死去的。　　「正在道時候，他們所倚着的護牆板了動了起來，全個敎堂連根搖了起來於是，露西，她的心因了炸彈的聲音與羣衆的驚呼跳得要死了，來不及害怕也來及難過，便把她的身體去抱住白利，如像一隻母鷄用他的翅膀遮着她的小鷄一樣——白利，他正含着幸福的微笑在閉他的眼睛。用着一種慈母似的動作，她用她全身的力將這親愛的頭抱住扺在她的胸前；蜷在他的身上，她的嘴吻着他的頭頸，他們緊緊的縮在一處」。」。　　「於是那龐然的牆壁，便轟然一下壓在他們的上面」。面」。　　他兩幸福地死去了，沒有多餘的　舌，沒有一聲嘆息，這平靜的死，也許正是大部分戀人的祈求吧。</p>

<p>滬濱絮語學學英國人  十郎　　讀完了「走馬英倫」，使人感慨無窮。爲着大英帝國的榮譽，英國人民然了七年的戰爭，德國人雖然給打侉了，但是大英帝國的權勢，却日見衰徵；在歐洲，在遠東，英帝國的旗職，不得不愁然降落，讓給權力膨脹的國家。（你總知道是誰！）　　但是，戰後災害，貧窮，飢餓，正在侵蝕着這個國家，英國人一向堅忍茹苦，不避艱難；長期戰爭都熬過去了，這個新的經濟危機與飢餓的狂潮，能够吞沒英國人麼？　　祖是食糧不足衣服襤褸，每人所能分到的配給券，不足使一家人得到溫飽；一個大學敎授，弄得面黃飢瘦，一個有名的學者，度着窮苦的生活；父母們把能餘下來的食品，統統給了孩子。　　英國人在低泣，在哀訴，戰後窮困，正在給這個民族最大的考騐。他們不是不能向人再伸手要錢，但是，外債借得愈多，英帝國的勢力圈、却更見萎縮；還是貪圖一時的舒適拼命高舉外債麽？那些一金元，正如一服毒劑，可以治療一時英國的飢渴，但是中毒太深，大英帝國將從此犧牲她的威望，地位，她心甘情願麽？　　英國人深懂得這個，他們寗可大家束緊了褲帶，熬得面黃飢瘦，決不願意再低頭向人伸手！　　英倫三島的紳士們，就能保持着這個硬朗！　　邱翁說得好，英國人一定能够安扺彼岸，英國民族決不會崩潰的。眼看着英國人民在低泣中煎熬，我們應寄予無上的敬意。　　但是回顧中國戰後情形，能比英倫好多少？一片災情，一把眼淚；窮奢極侈並未禁絕，一提禁舞，好像舉國惶惶然，一席百萬元的酒席，選覺得不够堂皇；一襲三百萬元的衣服，也還覺得寒酸；這些頽廢，無知，不知天高地厚的人，到處皆是。　　窮—餓—要比英倫三島不知壞到多少倍，但是歌榭舞塲的高歌急弦，並不能掩蓋全中國人民的低泣呵！　　看看英國人，作爲咱們的榜樣吧。自由談走馬英倫  楊鴻烈譯　　「和平與自由得到保障，實有賴英美的互相提携合作，英語民族的團結實足抵抗任何外來的侵犯，有武力才有和平，如果我們有着堂堂不可輕侮的陣容，敵人才不敢小視我們。　　他抱定這樣的主張，所以他曾振臂高呼應及時締結英美軍事同盟，他相信，也許只有强大的武力，才能維擊世界和平。　　將安抵彼岸　　我曾數度聽到故羅斯福總統對邱氏的敬慕，當我提及時，邱氏引我到一精緻的書架前，邱氏指我看一張卡片，上面印着林肯格梯斯伯演講辭，下面，是羅斯福總統與邱氏在雅爾達會議時所留的字跡；「我深願與你作更遠旅行，更願與你不久快樂重逢，」但豈知雅爾達會議竟爲羅邱最後一晤，一語竟成永訣！　　「邱吉爾先生！」我說，「英國正在苦難中，人們都在說除非全國一致刻苦耐勞，才能渡過難關。」　　「但，無論如何，」他說，「英國不是一個能崩潰的國家，吃過千辛萬苦，終將安抵彼岸，我再引你看一件東西。」　　他引我看到一些水上海港的設計圖，這助力於諾曼第登陸的利器，曾使納粹軍略家對這些神出鬼沒的東西大傷腦筋。　　附帶陳列着有關的文件，最初，工程專家們，報告首相絕對無法設計出一種水上海港，其次看到的是邱氏粗硬宇跡的命令；　　「不必和我爭吵，去和你的困難計較短長！」　　經過長久的研求試騐，不可能的問題終告解決，但，今日英倫又面臨新的險惡危機。　　當我離開柴特，邁勒，我看着那一身防空服的胖子揮手和我告別，在他手下曾描出幾張藝術家尊崇的傑作，也曾指揮海陸大軍走向凱旋，在晚霧迷濛中，我想起有勇氣有毅力，才能走向光明和勝利！　　戰後災害多　　究竟在英國復興途中有何困難？　　我曾和工黨政府最能幹的官員之一——尼爾，談起這個問題，他是貝文外長最信賴的助手之一。　　尼氏曾提到千萬美元借款如流水化去，幷且還需要更多的美元援助，對工黨的復與計劃却尚毫無所成，而國營事業範圍擴大，也未見對政府財政有何裨益，人們多在嘆苦，終日忍　耐寒，過着單調乏味的生活，七年來負荷着極重的稅租，情况無法改良，實在戰後國家原氣不易恢複。　　尼氏對我的間題，顯然有點驚疑和興趣。　　「英國地下煤藏極書，足够全國之用，但爲什麽不易開發出來？」　　「工人人數雖在慢慢增加，但實在工作環境也太苦了，礦塲改國營後，人們以為設備該現代化了，回礦的人不少，但產量日益减少，的確，離職的工人也不少！」　　「工人爲何相繼離去？」　　「根本是由於生活太單調了，一個工人額外得到幾文薪工，徘徊在一些空空如也的商店前，他們只有感到有錢無處可用之苦。」　　况且，七年艱苦勞力，終日食不求飽，戰後一片災害，冰凍和洪水，使我們失去二百萬頭羊羣，——當然食物和羊毛隨着損失了，三萬頭牛亦被死傷，五十萬畝糧田一塲洪水洗光，七萬畝稻麥遭受損失，隨之毀滅的還有八萬噸馬鈴薯。」　　「你們的敵黨在講你們曾如何爲全英人民描出一幅富强康樂的遠景，但我想你們會不好意告訴他們那希望將化爲烏有。」　　「我們總算盡力而爲了，我們曾答應人民房屋的居住問題，但戰後百廢待興，目前還難如願；而前途荆棘叢叢，可能將來配給更少，生活更苦，我們將開誠布公告訴人民，共體時艱，度過困苦的日子！」　　將國家復興　　　劍橋大學不遠，我曾和著名的基督徒李梧敎授一晤，他年高的老母因患病寸步難移，家中無法另僱僕役，他除服侍老母，尚須料理家務，略有閒暇，他就要坐下來批閱學生們的課外作業。　　他曾談起今日英國靑年都在辛勤的學習着，他們見到祖國滿目瘡痍，該是他們的責任來將國家復興！　　在伊麗莎白皇后號船上，微風帶來一陣鹹澀的海洋氣味，不覺引起一陣鄉思，雜著一些莫名的感慨，想起在倫敦以三套羊毛內衫送人，受者如獲至寳，千謝萬謝，隨著是一陣低泣。想起一羣襤褸瘦弱的父母，把所有的配給票分配給孩子們用去，大學敎授終日家務忙碌，更隨即又隨侍著病重的老母。　　偶爾不禁想起一個老熟的鄉曲：　　「同胞們！奮起！巴登曾說　　我雖微傷，但却不曾死亡！　　讓我臥倒喘息片刻，　　讓鮮血浸透過襟衫，　　片刻後，　　我將奮起，　　重新奔向戰塲！」（下）　　（譯自八月號讀者文摘）旅美什錦  徐菽園　　在美國是向來看不到交通警察的，紅綠燈旣是自動開關，汽車階級也都能遵守秩序，交通警察原非需要，市政當局也可省却一筆經費，在上海雖也有自動的紅綠燈，但還得憑仗警察先生的大力去開關，此外則人力車夫三輪車夫水準太低，不能遵守行車秩序，也得煩警察先生提座墊，那是交通管理中的一齣雜劇。美國習慣是汽車等人，人在穿過馬路，汽車停下來等候行人走過去，中國是人等汽車，看看四下沒有汽車風馳電閃而來，才敢豕奔豹突的跑過馬路，我國汽車階級的不顧行車秩序，間接是對交通警察不敬，自動紅綠燈交替的時間有定，所以你從家裏上辦公室，不論乘車或步行，都可預先算出時間，決不會被軋擠在路角，一等就是一刻鐘。汽重駛過學校和醫院，向例不得撳喇叭，學校或醫院當局在馬路中豎一塊警告牌，普通是一個鋁皮或木質的小孩像，你老遠就看見一個小孩立在路中，上面寫着Attention，School，我們知道駛近學校，自動開慢車，難保在上學放學時間，有小孩穿過馬路，這是一種不成文法，有汽車的人都自動遵守，決不把人命開玩笑。在美國，汽車搶先是犯法的，即使在寬闊的公路上，也不得隨便搶先，美國公路每隔若干里就有一段特別寬闊的地方，你要搶先非得開到那特別寬闊的一段不可，而且事先須大撳喇叭，使前面的車輛知所戒備，美國公路上有交通巡邏隊騎了機器脚踏車專查行車不遵規定的人，行車速度在郊外不得超過四十英里，在郊內二十五英里，在鬧市十五英里，在學校或醫院附近不得超過五英里，你如果犯了規，給巡邏隊查覺，即使他不當面把你捉住，他抄下你的汽車號碼，預測你將經過何處，打一個電話給前面的巡邏站，便早有警察架着機器脚踏車橫立在將中央，攔住你的去路，你的汽車經過任何緊要叉道，有便衣交通警察抄下你的號碼，如果你在公路上撞倒了人，自以爲不曾被人看到，不妨逃之夭夭，警察把各車號碼及駛過時間一對照，使你百緣莫辯，你岡狡賴，他們可用各種偵謊器Lie-letector來截穿你。（四二）新秋凉意  本報資料室輯　　（光緒廿一年八月十日）　　今夏氣候，雖不最熱，但在房荒之際，侷促蝸居，不熱已感其苦，况炎夏耶。現已交秋，滬人咸望溫度能即下降，若能如五十年前，必皆大歡事矣。　　「滬上自旬日以來，氣候酷熱，每當桐蔭潑墨，竹院敲棋，凈几明窗，織　不到，猶覺汗涔涔下，更何論驅車廣陌，負担長途。……十八日寅正二刻二分，交立秋節。以是　暑者咸欣然以喜，謂自此“以脫身塵鞅，　魄冰台灣矣。是夜　鼓三撾，忽聞有聲如虎吼，茜紗窗　，震撼不已。俄而瑽瑽錚錚，金鐵皆鳴，則風伯雨師，早已並轡而來，大展神通。將大千世界，無數炎障，一掃而空之，誠快意事也。……」頑貓阿咪（六）  張樂平社會服務癌有兩種惡性居多　　黃梅庭先生：　　我們由申報社會服務部轉來的函件　，讀悉了你的病症。照理，我們是應該早日給你解答的，可是因爲來信詢問的人太多，所以一直擱到現在才來答覆你，害你等待了怎麽長久，心裏實在不安，請你原諒吧！茲特答覆來問如下：　　不錯，你說的，廿一歲的靑年照常例是不會患癌症的。可是我得告訴你；癌有兩種，一種是普通所謂的癌Carcinom，另一種是Sarkom（肌肉瘤？）。這種Sarkom，可以在幼年時代發生，甚爲惡性。如果你所患的是這一種，那末就是無法可想了。關於癌的治法，目下尚無有效的療法。所謂鐳錠以及愛克司光之類，也不過是「比較性」的一種療法而已。我們覺得很抱歉，對於癌的療法，到現在還沒有一種有效的藥物。不過，我們很希望，將來在原子能的硏究方面，或許會有成就吧。　　對於營養方面，我們以爲是不拘任何種類都可以服用的，只要它能够容易消化而且富於營養就够了。匆此即祝健康！　　新醫與新　編輯部啓讀者信箱　　（醫藥）　　上海朱德興君鑒：函悉。（一）令友顧君是否肺病，應照X光檢視，並可將所吐之痰加以檢驗。喉頭微血管甚多，痰中偶有血點，未必即爲肺結核所致；即係肺病，如能早期治療，十之八九可獲痊愈，故無須恐懼。（二）尊恙有慢性盲腸炎之嫌，希就醫診治之　　上海朱本炎君鑒：函悉。尊夫人之恙，仍應就醫診治。所謂秘方，無科學根據，未便代爲徵求。　　上海王必金君鑒：函悉。尊恙應魷治於皮膚科醫師，外搽藥隨便試用實屬不妥。　　上海洪平君鑒：函悉。尊恙希就皮膚科醫師診治爲妥。究屬何症，以所述不明，無從臆測。　　（其他）　　上海郁　雲君鑒：函悉。軍醫提絜一書，係軍醫提絜編輯委員會編印，該會地址在上海前市中心翔股路二號。是否尚可預約，希逕函洽。　　上海汪勤君鑒：函悉。囑事未能刋出，甚歉。此事可向資方協商，以謀改善。</p>

<h3>National Troops Reach Laizhou Bay Coast; Communist Land Connection Between Northern Shandong and Shandong Peninsula Severed; Liu Bocheng's Remnants Flee Towards Dabie Mountains</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Daily Dispatch] After the national troops crossed the Xiaoqing River, they completely controlled the line from Gaoyuan to Yangjiaogou, with no communist bandits south or north of the Xiaoqing River. The land connection between communist troops in northern Shandong and the Shandong Peninsula has been severed for the first time. The vanguard of the national troops has reached the coast of Laizhou Bay. Communist troops are fleeing towards Putai and Huimin. It is expected that the south bank of the Yellow River will soon be completely recovered. Currently, communist troops still occupy small stations along the Jiaoji Railway between Gaomi and Fangzi to protect their supply routes along the coast. It is reported that the actual strength of the communist troops in Jiaodong is only one column.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] After the national troops recovered Boxing, north of the Xiaoqing River, they continued to mop up the surrounding areas on the 20th. The western route has advanced to the vicinity of Gaoyuan. The national troops advancing north from Changshan also approached the outskirts of Huanhecheng on the 20th after recovering Datian. The Wang Yaowu division of the national troops, after recovering Boshan, joined forces with the Ou Zhen division advancing north from Laiwu on the 20th near Hezhuang, and are continuing to clear out scattered remnants in the surrounding areas. On the 20th, the national air force scouted towns along the lower reaches of the Yellow River and discovered about fifty communist trucks gathered near Putai. They strafed and bombed them, destroying a total of about thirty trucks.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] The national troops advancing south from Zichuan recovered Boshan County on the 20th. The entire Zhangbo branch line is now in the hands of our troops, and they are continuing to mop up the remaining communist bandits on both sides of the railway. Also, the Wang Yaowu division of the national troops recovered Boxing on the afternoon of the 19th. In addition, the air force sank more than 400 bandit ships in the area between the Xiaoqing River, Yangjiaogou, and Longkou on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] After successively recovering Huaiyang, Fugou, Yanling, and Xihua on the 19th, the national troops in eastern Henan crossed the Ying River and pursued and annihilated the communist bandit Liu as he fled south into southern Henan. The remnants of the bandit's 36th column reached the Runan and Zhengyang areas on the 20th. The remnants of his 127th column fled to the Shenqiu and Xincai area on the 20th. The center of the war has clearly shifted from eastern Henan to southern Henan. The plan of Liu's remnants to flee to the Dabie Mountains and Tongbai Mountains is becoming increasingly evident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops have crossed the Sha River and fled towards the northeastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains.

<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 20th] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops, who roamed through Henan and Anhui, have been fleeing under the scorching sun for days. Many have suffered from heatstroke. Furthermore, after being repeatedly attacked by the combined forces of the army and air force, they have lost their will to fight and are surrendering in large numbers. The bandits at Xin'anji, north of Shenqiu, are crossing the Sha River and heading towards Xiangcheng. Their westward flight is likely aimed at the Funiu Mountains.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ships Transporting Supplies to Aid Communist Bandits; Our Government Closely Monitoring; Director Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference on the afternoon of the 20th. Director Dong Xian Guang answered various questions as follows:</p>
<p>[Question] Has the Chinese government submitted a report to General Wedemeyer, and what is its content? [Answer] General Wedemeyer's mission to China is to investigate the facts. Therefore, the government regularly provides relevant information on various government activities as needed. The so-called "report" in the question probably refers to the information.</p>
<p>[Question] When will the private business delegation sent by China to Japan arrive?</p>
<p>[Answer] The departure date of the Chinese private business delegation to Japan has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Question] There are rumors that Soviet ships are traveling between Lushun (Port Arthur), Dalian, and the Shandong coast, supplying communist areas with goods and military supplies. Does the Director have any information to report on this?</p>
<p>[Answer] Foreign ships are not allowed to navigate the Chinese coast and inland rivers. Dalian is our country's territory, and foreign ships should not use Dalian as a port of entry and exit for navigating along our country's territorial waters. The report mentioned in the question is being closely monitored by our government.</p>
<p>[Question] What is the latest military situation?</p>
<p>[Answer] Except for a 50-kilometer section between Gaomi and Zuoshan, the Jiaoji Railway is entirely in the hands of the national troops. A portion of the communist troops has retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River. The other remnants have fled east to the tip of the Shandong Peninsula. In central Shandong, the national troops have reached Yangjiaogou on the coast of the Bohai Sea, cutting off the communist bandits' supply line between Hebei and eastern Shandong. Liu Bocheng's communist troops, trapped in a corner of western Shandong, attempted to cross the Yellow River northward at Shuhe, but only about a thousand people reached the other side. More than ten thousand surrendered. The remnants, after being reorganized into the new Fourth Column, were again oppressed by the national troops and moved to eastern Henan. Currently, the national troops are pursuing and annihilating them between the Sha River and the Hong River. In northern Shaanxi, the communist strongholds of Suide and Mizhi were successively recovered by the national troops last week. Currently, the main force of the communist bandits in this area, totaling eleven brigades, has retreated to the area between Xian County and Yangbao on the west bank of the Yellow River.

<h3>Wedemeyer Briefly Came to Shanghai; Returned to Nanjing on the Same Day After Completing Unfinished Business</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Special Envoy Wedemeyer arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning by special plane. He had lunch with the US Acting Consul General Meyer at noon. In the afternoon, he had some discussions with US personnel in Shanghai. He returned to Nanjing by the same plane at about 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Wedemeyer, accompanied by translator Captain Wu Hanmin, left Nanjing at 10:00 am on the 20th and flew to Shanghai for a one-day stay to complete matters that he had been unable to conclude in previous visits. He returned to the capital at 7:00 pm amid a sudden downpour. The other members of the delegation remained in Nanjing to study materials and prepare for other appointments in the coming days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Wedemeyer's one-day stay in Shanghai on the 20th was to collect information to supplement the report he is preparing to submit to President Truman. Observers believe that he is particularly interested in the reaction in Shanghai to the Chinese government's promulgation of new foreign exchange measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to sources close to the Wedemeyer mission, the report currently being rushed by the mission is only a fragment, and is a compilation of various materials. The overall report to be submitted to the US President will have to wait until after returning to Washington. Wedemeyer had been feeling unwell, but has now recovered. It is also said that Wedemeyer has been working diligently every day since arriving in China, without interruption, and even worked until 2:00 am yesterday.</p>
<h3>Abandoning the Northeast: Wedemeyer Mission Does Not Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] A significant portion of the information Wedemeyer collected indicates that, from a strictly military point of view, abandoning the Northeast would not be an unwise move. However, other factors mean that the fact-finding Wedemeyer mission cannot realistically support this policy. In addition to military issues, Wedemeyer encountered other facts that could influence the views in his recommendations. The most important of these is that Japan was driven out of the Northeast through American aid.</p>
<p>Sources close to the delegation said Wedemeyer would delay any proposed action that effectively recognized the CCP regime. First, after the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek drive the Japanese out of the Northeast, such action would amount to abandoning the Northeast again. Second, according to some observers, such action would effectively place vast regions under the control of a puppet government with potential ties to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, they pointed out that if the U.S. is to assist China in its recovery, the U.S. cannot adopt a policy that prevents the central government from obtaining important northeastern resources such as coal and steel, the lack of which is already severely affecting [the nation]. Other factors Wedemeyer had to give weight to included:</p>
<p>(1) There is no guarantee that if the national troops are able to demarcate and defend a boundary after withdrawing from the Northeast, the communist party will limit its activities to the Northeast.</p>
<p>(2) The current U.S. "anti-communist policy" should be noted.</p>
<p>(3) Past U.S. policies and actions must also be noted, as the Communist Party has not forgotten past U.S. actions. In a recent broadcast, they drew attention to the fact that, at the end of the Sino-Japanese War, Wedemeyer, in his capacity as commander of the China Theater, was responsible for transporting national troops to North China and the Northeast. The CCP declared that since they had expelled the Japanese army from the Northeast, they would certainly be able to drive out American imperialism from the Northeast as well.</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles in Sichuan Suggest Strict Control of Japan</h3>
<p>Joint Letter to Special Envoy Wedemeyer</p>

Generals Kliher and Wright were both in uniform. After taking photos upon disembarking, they answered questions from reporters on the spot, saying that this was their first visit to China and they were very happy. The mission assigned to them in Japan was to investigate the general situation of Japan, in order to assist the government in preparing for the peace conference and peace treaty with Japan. They have already gained a lot in the past three weeks. According to Brooke, Japan's economic situation is quite poor, especially the lack of fuel, and very few factories are open. However, when asked about the issue of Japanese reparations, he declined to answer. They are scheduled to visit our government leaders on the 21st, pay homage to Chairman Chiang at 5:00 pm in the afternoon, and attend a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Wang in the evening. On the 22nd, they will attend luncheons and dinners hosted by General Lucas, the head of the US Military Advisory Group, and Minister Bai, respectively. They will attend a reception at the Canadian Embassy in the evening and fly to Guangzhou on the 23rd before returning to Canada via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, Kliher asked about the whereabouts of General Sun Liren as soon as he got off the plane, as Sun had met him in the Netherlands and had visited the Canadian First Military Group led by Kliher. Brigadier General Wright and Brooke also arrived on the same plane today. According to the itinerary arranged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the delegation: They will pay homage to Minister Wang Shijie, Minister Bai Chongxi, and President Zhang Qun in the morning of the 21st, and Minister Yu Dawei in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Suspension of Sale of US Dollar Treasury Bonds; Ministry of Finance Formulates Measures; Those Already Sold Will Be Repaid at the Official Exchange Rate in National Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] United Credit Reporting Agency News: Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange control measures, regarding whether to continue selling US dollar treasury bonds, the Ministry of Finance has formulated two measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The measures are as follows: (1) No more sales will continue, (2) The 27 million US dollars that have already been sold will still be converted into national currency at the official exchange rate and repaid in installments. It is also learned that the government made this decision because A. The 27 million US dollars sold in recent months is far from the planned target and has no value for resale. B. If the official exchange rate is adjusted after a considerable period of time, if sales continue at the official exchange rate, the government will suffer significant losses in the future when repaying the principal. However, if sales and repayments are made at market prices, it will involve the repayment of principal on US dollar bonds issued in 1938, 1940, and 1942.</p>
<h3>Authoritative Source Says General Elections Will Be Held as Scheduled; Government Has Absolutely Not Considered Postponing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Recently, there has been much doubt about the government's handling of national general elections, and even speculation about postponing the election. The reporter specifically visited an authoritative source in charge of national election affairs, who said: The government, based on the resolutions of the National Assembly, and in accordance with the constitution, is implementing the preparatory procedures, formulating various constitutional laws and implementing regulations for various election and recall laws as scheduled, and has established a general election office to conduct national election affairs. There has been absolutely no consideration of delaying the election date. Since the first committee meeting was held on June 25, there have been many meetings, starting with the formulation of the procedures for the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, which were promulgated and implemented. Then, the candidates for the members of the various election offices under its jurisdiction were decided and submitted to the National Government for approval and appointment within a time limit. At the same time, various difficult questions in the laws and technical aspects were examined and explained in detail and circulated for information. At the seventh meeting, it was resolved that the various provincial and municipal governments should be instructed to instruct the various grassroots election offices to announce the various voter lists on the 27th of this month as scheduled (the National Election Office had instructed various localities to prepare for the survey and registration of voters earlier). All of this has been detailed in the newspapers and is known to the whole country, which proves that the government has absolutely not considered postponing the elections. Now, the various election offices under its jurisdiction have reported their establishment one after another. They are actively starting work. The General Office handles an average of more than 100 reports and requests for instructions from the various election offices every day. Judging by the intensity of the work, it can be determined the extent of progress of the national election affairs. Even if a part of the region is disturbed by bandits, methods must be studied and applied to deal with it, in order to overcome difficulties and not affect the progress of the entire election process, so as not to delay the constitutional implementation date solemnly resolved by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] The Wuhan Election Office was formally established on the 20th.</p>
<h3>The Government Decides to Unify the Currency System; Northeast Circulating Notes Will Enter Customs Territory for Use; Ministry of Economic Affairs to Reward Exports of Bristles and Silk</h3>
<p>[Our North China Dispatch, 20th] The central government has resolved to unify the national currency system. This work will begin with adjusting the exchange rate between Northeast circulating notes and the legal tender (法幣) and putting them into use. It is reported that, in order to stabilize the value of the Northeast circulating notes, the government has decided to allow the legal tender to enter customs territory. The relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance have already started planning this measure, and the responsible authorities in the Northeast have also studied it. The preliminary decision is that the exchange rate between the legal tender and the circulating notes will be ten to one. In this way, the Northeast circulating notes will be used both inside and outside customs territory in the status of half the value of customs gold units (關金) (the legal tender and customs gold units are at a ratio of 20:1, circulating note 1 yuan equals half yuan customs gold unit), but the final decision still awaits Zhang Jia'ao's personal inspection of the Northeast. The reorganization of Taiwan currency and Xinjiang currency system have also been included in the central government's currency system reform plan. However, because the needs are not as urgent as those of the Northeast, the implementation is pending.</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the new measures for the management of imports and exports, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is making efforts in many ways to reward the export of materials. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, hog bristles are one of the main export commodities. Due to the differences in hog breeds, climate, and soil quality in China, the quality of the products also varies. Generally speaking, the goods from Chongqing are the best, followed by Hankou, and then Shanghai and Tianjin. In order to promote exports, the Ministry of Economic Affairs first formulated detailed measures for inspection methods, so that the quality can be compared more closely. In terms of silk, the Silk Production and Marketing Association, which is jointly run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, has recently hired many experts and established a design committee to be responsible for various design works related to silkworm cocoon production and marketing in order to promote business. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is not yet aware of whether the import quota for raw materials for wool textiles will be relaxed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the new measures for foreign exchange management, some people in the financial community believe that when the government sells more foreign exchange than it receives in a certain period, the legal tender will return too much, the money market will tighten, and it will affect commercial firms. Now, according to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, this situation may occur, but at least it will not happen in the next six months. Because the government still sets quotas for imported goods and restricts imports, the amount of foreign exchange required for imports is not large. Even in terms of the total amount of import distribution in the third quarter, it is not too large, and the foreign exchange received by the government during the same period can be roughly equal. As for the future, if there is an imbalance, the government will have appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province's Export Trade Is Expected to Become Gradually Active</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Yan Jia, Director of the Taiwan Finance Department, said: "After the revision of the foreign exchange and import and export trade measures, Taiwan Province's export trade, which has been stagnated for three months, is expected to become gradually active." However, the Bank of Taiwan here still posts prices according to the official price. Each US dollar is equivalent to 179.07 Taiwan dollars. According to the bank, it will start publishing the daily exchange rate after receiving the notice from the Central Bank. In addition, today's market price for US dollars is 715 Taiwan dollars for buying and 730 Taiwan dollars for selling (equivalent to 47.450 legal tender dollars).</p>
<p>[Our North China Dispatch, 20th] The Central Bank's North China branch has not yet been ordered to start posting foreign exchange rates. The person in charge of the National Bank said that the head office may wait until all the specific measures are prepared before sending telegrams to various places to post the rates.</p>
<p>[Our Tientsin Dispatch, 20th] The Tianjin Central Bank has no foreign exchange rates, but the designated operating banks have already started foreign exchange transactions on the 20th. The buying price of US dollars is 40,800 yuan, and the selling price is 42,000 yuan, which is still lower than the black market price. Commodity prices in Tianjin once rose slightly, but now they have returned to a sluggish decline.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 20th] The market here was once chaotic a few days ago, but now it has gradually become clear. Transactions in various industries are sluggish, and prices are generally falling. The market price of goods is 2.4 million yuan per tael, US dollars are traded at market prices, and Vietnamese currency has risen slightly to 1,100 yuan per yuan.</p>

This material is listed under the post-war lend-lease material and is specifically allocated for use after China's victory. (2) The number of surplus materials agreed upon was US$584 million. As of June 30, 1947, the actual value of materials received was US$71.1 million. The United States Overseas Surplus Property Disposal Committee announced on August 1, 1947: "To date, the published value of surplus materials delivered to China is US$170 million." However, according to the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, this published figure still needs to be carefully reviewed, and as of June 30, 1947, the actual amount received was US$71.1 million. (3) The amount of loans from the Export-Import Bank agreed upon was US$62,550,000, and the actual value of materials received was US$37,525,000. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government has signed five loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank to purchase cotton, power plants, coal mines, and railway equipment, totaling 16 ships. The total amount of these five loans is as mentioned above, US$62,550,000. Currently, except for the ships and cotton, the remaining materials have not been received. (4) The amount of relief materials from the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration agreed upon was US$535 million, and the actual value of materials received was US$410,049,400. The actual value of materials received by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is calculated at US$200 per ton, so the number is approximately US$410,494,800. According to the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration figures, as of June 28, 1947, the total amount of materials actually received by China was 2,052,474 tons.</p>
<p>In total, the total amount of post-war rent materials, surplus materials, Export-Import Bank loans, and China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration relief materials, the US aid to China's post-war economic recovery, the total amount agreed upon was US$1,240,450,000, and in the past two years, the total amount of materials actually received was 561,398,672 yuan and 78 cents. The above figures do not include the materials received by the units affiliated to the Ministry of National Defense, which amounted to US$95,437,725.15, and the various expenses for the airlift of troops after the victory over Japan were not included. It may be incidentally stated that, in addition to the United States, Canada is the only country that provided financial assistance to China after World War II. In early 1946, the Canadian government gave China a loan of 60 million Canadian dollars.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Staff's Imprudent Demands Seem to Be Exploited by Others</h3>
<p>Director Dong Expresses Two Points of View</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Office answered the following questions at a press conference on the afternoon of the 20th: (Question) Some UNRRA personnel who requested the suspension of all materials to China believe that the Chinese government's reply is a rejection of UNRRA's proposal. Does the government agree with this interpretation? (Answer) Of course not. Both the UNRRA office in China and the headquarters in Washington believe that the request of some of its staff is an imprudent move. If the news reports are true, and the majority of UNRRA personnel remaining in China have indeed requested the Central Committee in Washington to suspend all relief materials to China and request the transfer of UNRRA personnel stationed in China, I would like to express two points of view here: It is inappropriate for an official of a United Nations agency to be stationed in a member country and make a public political statement to attack the government of this member country. If more than half of the approximately 500 foreign staff of the UNRRA office in China have simultaneously sent the same telegram, then they seem to have been exploited by some who intend to humiliate the National Government of China in a planned manner. (Question) Regarding UNRRA's proposal to transport relief materials to the war zone north of 34 degrees north latitude, is the Chinese government currently considering further action? (Answer) The Chinese government accepts the recommendations of the UNRRA Central Committee, but with some amendments. It is understood that UNRRA is convening a meeting of the Central Committee to consider China's response. Before the Committee makes a decision, I have nothing to report.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Rubber Factories in Singapore Are Facing a Crisis of Closure</h3>
<p>Affected by the Exchange Rate between the Dutch Guilder and the Straits Dollar</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 20th] Twelve rubber factories owned by overseas Chinese here are about to declare closure due to the suspension of the supply of raw rubber from Sumatra. Li Guangqian, chairman of the Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce here, admitted the seriousness of the above situation when he met with reporters this afternoon. He also explained the reason for the suspension of raw rubber imports. Part of the reason is that the Netherlands prohibits transportation along the ports of Sumatra, but the main reason is that the Netherlands controls the exchange rate between the guilder and the Straits dollar. In the black market, one guilder is only worth 20 cents of Straits dollars, while the Netherlands insists on an exchange rate of one guilder for 80 cents of Straits dollars, which is unacceptable to merchants.</p>

<h3>Chinese Physicists Qian Sanqiang and His Wife Invented the Atomic Quadrisection Method; Successful Experiment in France and Published a Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] Chinese physicists Qian Sanqiang and his wife, who are studying in France, recently invented the atomic quadrisection method in Paris. According to Henry, the science editor of the Washington Star on July 10, Dr. Qian Sanqiang and Dr. He Zehui of the French Academy in Paris have invented the atomic quadrisection method. His report is published in the "Nature" magazine sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The following is a translation of Henry's report: The method of three-part and four-part fission of atomic nuclei has recently been clarified by two Chinese physicists at the French Academy in Paris. This may be the greatest discovery in nuclear physics since the first invention of the fission of uranium atoms in 1939. According to recent reports from here, Dr. Qian Sanqiang and Dr. He Zehui have made a photographic film coated with a solution of uranium, an important starting point for obtaining atomic energy, subjected to neutron bombardment. To this day, experiments have shown that atoms can be split into two parts of almost equal weight at the same time, converting a small amount of the original material into 150 million volts of electricity, making the manufacture of atomic bombs the main key to making it possible, lies in finding a way to make an atom split and then make adjacent atoms split in the same way, thus creating a chain reaction. The above-mentioned two Chinese scientists have recently clearly proved that one out of every 300 atomic fissions can be split into three, each weighing 131, 99, and 5 times that of hydrogen atoms. This weight is different from the weight of any known element. The lightest part is the first of the three kinds of light coins emitted by radium, etc., and the heavier part of the atomic emitter can be regarded as emitted by tin. When the atom is split into three parts, the atomic weight of the lightest part is sometimes nine, which is different from the properties of any known purple. The four-part split of the atom is even rarer. There is only one in every 3,000 splits, and the four parts after the split are also different from any natural element. Qian He's report was published in the "Nature" magazine sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>

<h3>Editorial: On Levying a Property Donation and Commercial Rights</h3>
<p>The idea of levying a one-time property donation, also known as a special construction donation, has been widely circulated for a long time. Recently, reports have indicated that the Ministry of Finance has drafted a plan for the levy of this special donation and will submit it to the National Economic Commission, the Legislative Yuan, the Political Council, and other agencies for discussion and decision, after which it will be finalized, announced, and implemented. After reading this plan, we feel compelled to say a few words.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that the country is now in a difficult period. National construction and restoration, mobilization to quell the rebellion, all require funds. After a long period of war, the country's tax base is depleted. To meet the necessary national expenditures, the government has no choice but to broadly seek ways to increase the national treasury. A one-time levy of a special property donation is not necessarily a bad way to manage finances. Moreover, during wartime, there are inevitably those who speculate and profit, becoming suddenly wealthy. These people who have become wealthy through the war environment should fulfill their responsibilities to the country and the people. Although they have had opportunities to donate in the past, such as raising funds for treasury bonds and government bonds, as well as making cash contributions, these have mostly been voluntary and lack any mandatory nature, making them easy to evade. Therefore, at this time, the measure of levying a one-time property donation is, in theory and in principle, a method that should be supported by the entire country. After World War I, Germany and Czechoslovakia faced serious domestic situations, especially economic conditions, and took similar measures. Now, the dangers our country faces are ten or a hundred times greater than those of post-war Europe at that time. Levying a special property donation at this time is not only a financial policy to increase the national treasury but also has profound social effects, allowing the wealth of society to be dedicated to national use, indirectly achieving the goal of equalizing wealth.</p>
<p>However, the term "property donation" or "one-time property tax" really leaves room for consideration. According to the plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance, the explanation of the principles includes the following statement: "The one-time property tax advocated by the general public at present is not an ordinary property tax that levies income generated from property. Property income can be taxed annually, while the one-time property tax targets the property itself and is levied only once." From this, it can be seen that the so-called special construction donation or one-time property tax is fundamentally different from the nature of a general property tax. In terms of its nature, it is really not a general property donation or property tax (General Property Tax), but a capital levy (Capital Levy). Therefore, we believe that "special construction donation" may be a more appropriate term, or it should be called "capital levy" or "asset levy," but not a term like property donation or property tax. Because the levy planned this time, according to the plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance, is clearly not a property tax but targets the property itself, that is, levying a certain portion from the property itself, limited to one time, which is equivalent to levying a certain portion of capital or assets.</p>
<p>Since the assets themselves are the target, we believe that how to levy this special donation is very important. China's statistics and official records have long been deficient in their attention to numbers. Although this trend has changed slightly in recent times and is gradually improving, the incompleteness of statistical figures is undoubtedly suspect. Therefore, attempting to levy this asset or capital at this time will inevitably encounter great difficulties in practice. Therefore, we must give extremely careful consideration to how to levy this special donation. We believe that since this special donation targets the property itself, its levy should naturally target property or assets. Now, the plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance takes the individual as the taxable entity, and we are deeply afraid that if this method is adopted, the people of the whole country, especially the declining aristocratic families, will be restless. As a result, the benefits to the national treasury may not be very effective, and the goal of balancing social wealth may be even more distant.</p>
<p>The plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance states: "The property donation will be levied on individuals whose current value of total property exceeds one billion yuan, with the individual as the tax subject and the following property as the taxable object: (1) land and buildings, (2) deposits and foreign exchange, government bonds and stocks, (3) gold and foreign currency, (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad, (5) the net value of sole proprietorship or partnership business assets, (6) all privately owned means of transportation, (7) machinery and goods." This provision, on the surface, seems very open and aboveboard, but in practice, "the movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad" is not only difficult to estimate, but there must be a very noteworthy portion that has been changed to foreign names, and collection will inevitably face practical difficulties. Therefore, this clause may likely become a dead letter. So, who will be the main payers of the so-called property donation? That is, those who own land and buildings. This is especially obvious in the inland. In our vast inland, most of the aristocratic families of the past own land and buildings. In the social changes of the last thirty years, most of the original aristocratic families have long been holding onto the past. After the Anti-Japanese War, those who have survived are few. Because their property is land and buildings, these land and buildings are difficult to sell and difficult to mortgage to switch to other industries. Therefore, although all their property increases in value with the market price, this is at most a figure on paper, and their actual situation may not be poor and pitiful. If the main target of the special property donation is only these declining aristocratic families, the result may not only fail to enrich the national treasury, but the people will inevitably suffer great disturbances. Moreover, because of the various provisions for secret reports and investigations, it may lead to unscrupulous officials seeking personal gain and engaging in malpractice. The results are unimaginable!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the levy of a special property donation, since it targets the property itself, should take the property itself as the main body, not entirely the individual. Bank account transactions and the capital of companies and firms themselves are sufficient standards for accurate estimation of assets. Rather than levying a property donation on the shareholders of banks, factories, and commercial firms, it would be more convenient and inescapable to levy it directly on the banks, factories, and commercial firms. The assets of individuals are difficult to estimate and collect, while the assets of companies and firms should have records to verify, making it less easy to evade. Therefore, if a property donation is to be levied, which in practice is really an "asset levy," then we believe that the main body of the levy should not be the individual but the property itself.</p>
<p>In short, the levy of a financial donation is not only to increase the national treasury but also to balance social wealth. Those who have property must be able to truly dedicate their property for national use, and only then can the purpose of levying this special donation be achieved. We hope that the government can consider carefully before implementation and execute fairly after implementation.</p>

<h3>Dutch Governor Van Mook Declares: Determined to Retain Occupied Areas; US Formally Withdraws Mediation Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 20th (Broadcast): Dutch Acting Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, announced today: The Dutch military will continue to retain the wealthy areas of Sumatra and Madura, which have been occupied since July 21. The reason given was: "These areas have become security zones and should be kept safe." Van Mook also stated: The Netherlands will no longer recognize Indonesia's authority in this regard. Neutral parties should be aware that Van Mook's statement implies that the Dutch will launch a major attack on the Indonesian capital unless the Indonesian side ceases its violations of the "ceasefire."</p>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta, 20th] The Indonesian cabinet, anticipating the imminent resumption of large-scale warfare with the Netherlands, held an emergency meeting today to formulate plans to relocate the capital to Sumatra if necessary. Military leaders also attended to discuss various measures to cope with future Dutch offensives. The cabinet's initial action will be to appoint Vice President Hatta, who is currently stationed in Bukittinggi, a mountainous stronghold in northern Sumatra, as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian military, so that he can formally lead the government and the military in the event that President Sukarno is unable to exercise his powers. Earlier, a dispatch from Batavia quoted a Dutch official spokesman as saying that the Dutch military authorities, given the current position which is easy to attack but difficult to defend, have urged the Hague government to authorize an order to attack Yogyakarta.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th (United Press)] The United States has formally withdrawn its proposal to mediate the Indonesian dispute, the State Department said. We believe that our proposal is no longer valid, as Indonesia has twice attached conditions to its response to the US proposal.</p>
<h3>Indonesia Reiterates Position: Still Requests International Arbitration; Jiang Tingfu Proposes a Compromise</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian government stated to the Security Council today that it cannot accept the Netherlands' proposal to resolve the Indonesian dispute. The telegram stated: If the Dutch government allows the Dutch military to massively violate the ceasefire order and occupy all the territory of the Republic, then the government and people of the Republic will obviously defend themselves by all means. If this happens, a large-scale conflict will inevitably reignite. The telegram finally stated that the Republic specifically requests the Security Council to send a delegation to Indonesia as soon as possible to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire order and to resolve the dispute through an international arbitration commission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 19th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu today proposed an amendment to Australia's proposal to establish a special Indonesian investigation committee at the Security Council's temporary meeting: (1) Approve the measures suggested by the Dutch, such as consular reports, impartial investigations, and supervision by a country; (2) Ask Batavia and the consular corps to provide reports to the Security Council when necessary, so that the Council can make further considerations on Indonesian matters. Jiang's proposal immediately received the support of US representative Johnson.</p>
<h3>Johnson Refutes Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>Johnson denied Soviet accusations of exerting political pressure on Indonesia to force it to accept US mediation. The Australian representative completely rejected China's amendment, believing that such a solution to the Indonesian issue would be outside the Security Council. The Security Council is scheduled to discuss the Indonesian issue again on the 21st.</p>

<h3>Three US Soldiers Stationed in Korea Suddenly Kidnapped by the Soviets; Hodge Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 20th] An army spokesman announced on the 20th: Three soldiers of the US 32nd Infantry Division were kidnapped by Soviet army personnel on August 12 while conducting routine inspections of telephone lines in a city on the US-Soviet border in Korea. All three soldiers are being held incommunicado. General Hodge has sent two letters of inquiry to Soviet Commander Kolotkov of North Korea, but has not received a response. On the same day, the Soviet commander of the city requested that a US officer bring a translator to negotiate their release. However, after the US officer arrived, he was told that the three men would continue to be tried and could not be released. General Hodge and the US liaison officer in Pyongyang have made efforts to find out where the three men are being held and what crimes they are accused of, but to no avail. It is only known that "this case is being personally handled by Kolotkov." On August 18, Hodge sent a letter stating: "I strongly protest the continued imprisonment of the US soldiers. They were arrested during the day and were wearing US military uniforms." He also pointed out that Soviet soldiers had been arrested in the US zone in the past, but "at your request, they were immediately released."</p>

<h3>Clayton Flies to London Again; To Confer with Cripps on Important Economic Issues; US Loan to Britain Will Soon Be Exhausted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Authoritative sources report that US Undersecretary of State Clayton, who is conducting high-level economic negotiations in Geneva and Paris, is scheduled to fly from Paris to London this morning. He will have lunch with British Trade Minister Sir Stafford Cripps to discuss current matters.</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether Clayton intends to visit Prime Minister Attlee, nor has he scheduled a meeting with Chancellor Dalton. As for Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Foreign Office announced last night that he has returned to London to resume his vacation. Reliable sources report that Clayton's main purpose in this trip is to discuss with Cripps the crisis that the Geneva International Trade Conference has entered. However, the scope of his talks will certainly not be limited to this, as the difficulties faced by Britain in Geneva are fundamentally no different from the difficulties discussed in the dollar crisis talks currently being held in Washington. In other words, they are both the result of the dollar panic caused by the two clauses in the Anglo-American Loan Agreement that do not allow discrimination against imports from the dollar area and require the Bank of England to permanently exchange British pounds for US dollars at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The US-British financial meeting entered its third day today. According to diplomatic sources, Britain has temporarily allocated the remaining portion of the $3.75 billion loan to purchase raw materials, food, and machinery before the end of October. Unless a method is found to reduce dollar consumption, it will be forced to use its gold and dollar reserves worth $2.8 billion.</p>

<p>A Pimp in a Brothel Arrested, Confesses to Stealing Military Pay, The Madam's Keen Eye:</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Four lavish patrons suddenly arrived at a brothel at No. 65, Fulan Lane, Guizhou Road, yesterday afternoon. Their extravagant behavior aroused suspicion from the madam, who suspected them of being bandits and reported them to the Old Zhabei Police Station.

Subsequently, the investigating officer continued to search the rooms of the hotel where they were staying, seizing 8.48 million in legal currency, two gold bracelets, eighteen gold rings, and a considerable amount of other luggage. It was later learned that Zhuang was formerly the second squad leader of the first company of the first battalion of the Fifth Army's Service Department in Yanzhou, Shandong. On July 26, he was ordered by the military to collect military pay in Xuzhou. Taking advantage of the absence of the person in charge of the military supply department, he pried open the wooden boxes and stole 50 million yuan in military pay, fleeing to Shanghai to spend it. As the case involved military personnel stealing, the branch bureau intends to transfer it to the military authorities for punishment.</p>
<p>Case of Impersonating a Female Judge, Zhu Huangfangbai Prosecuted, Her Uncle Once Served as a Puppet Prosecutor:</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Zhu Huangfangbai impersonating a female judge was prosecuted yesterday by the prosecutor for disrupting order. The original text of the indictment is as follows: Zhu Huangfangbai, 25 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 282, Ji'an Lane, Jinling East Road. Because her uncle, Huang Yan, had served as a prosecutor in the Shanghai Puppet Court during the Japanese occupation, she had a tendency to impersonate a judge and swagger around. At around 9:00 PM on June 28th of this year, she went to the Venus Dance Hall on Madang Road to negotiate as a mediator for her relatives and friends. While sitting alone and sipping tea, she was mistaken for a dancer by patrons Zhou Zhenhua, Shi Jiaping, and others, who considered it an insult to her dignity. She used the name of a judge of this court to report the incident to the police, who took Zhou, Shi, and others to the Songshan Branch Bureau. The news spread and was published in various newspapers in the city. This court, finding no female judge named Zhu Huangfangbai, considered the matter to be disruptive to order and requested an investigation. Although the defendant denied the aforementioned criminal facts during the investigation, she admitted that at around 9:00 PM on June 28th of this year, she went to the Venus Dance Hall and was mistaken for a dancer by patrons, who attempted to solicit her for dancing, and that she reported the incident to the police, who took them to the Songshan Branch Bureau, which was later resolved with an apology from the other party. The fact that she reported the incident to the police using the name of a judge of this court, resulting in the patrons being taken to the bureau, is detailed in various newspapers in the city. Furthermore, the contents of the confidential report and the document from the Haimen Association in Shanghai corroborate each other, and the fact that the defendant openly impersonated the title of a public official is evident. It is in violation of Article 159 of the Criminal Law and is in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and a public prosecution is initiated.</p>
<p>Performing the Eight-Row Dance in the Courtyard, Noble Entertainment, Regulating Body and Mind, The Reasons for the Dance Industry's Petition to the Capital:</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 20th] Zheng Xian, Sun Hongyuan, and other representatives of the Shanghai Dance Industry Association arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 20th to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior regarding the ban on dancing. The Executive Yuan was received by Secretary-General Gan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs was received by Chief Secretary Yang Fang. According to Yang, the government's established policy of prohibiting commercial dancing is imperative, but the procedures and methods still need to be carefully considered. The representatives returned to Shanghai on the same day. Furthermore, the contents of the petition submitted by the representatives state that dancing is a noble entertainment, and in ancient China, there were stories of people performing the Eight-Row Dance in the courtyard. Using this as a leisure activity after work can regulate the body and mind and has inherent value and artistic function. It also argues that banning dancing will increase unemployment, affect social order, and reduce tax revenue for the Municipal Finance Bureau, among other reasons.</p>

From the first to the ninth sessions, each session rescued students who had dropped out of school, ranging from over a thousand to as many as five thousand, totaling 25,000 people. Their ability to continue their studies and complete their education relied on the continuous advancement of the scholarship campaign. The decision to continue the scholarship program in this newspaper this time was made yesterday at a meeting, where preliminary discussions were held and a preliminary budget was made. It is planned to establish three groups: junior high, senior high, and university. Assuming that 600 students are approved for the junior high group, with a subsidy of 500,000 yuan per student, a total of 300 million yuan is required. Assuming that 500 students are approved for the senior high group, with a subsidy of 700,000 yuan per student, a total of 350 million yuan is required. Assuming that 400 students are approved for the university and specialized school group, with a subsidy of 1 million yuan per student, a total of 400 million yuan is required. According to the above scholarship budget, at least 1.05 billion yuan is required. Some may ask how to raise this amount. This point seems difficult to answer, but in reality, many hands make light work, and many grains of sand make a tower. As long as all people in Shanghai contribute their efforts and money, the expected goal can be achieved in a short period. This newspaper now intends to request Chairman Du Yuesheng to donate 100 million yuan, Vice Chairman Shi Yongkang to donate 50 million yuan, President Pan Gongzhan to donate 50 million yuan, and the colleagues of this newspaper to raise 100 million yuan. With these items budgeted, 300 million yuan can be obtained. The remaining 750 million yuan will be solicited separately by people who are familiar with the situation in various sectors, and a special fundraising team will be formed, divided into two types: honorary team and ordinary team. The former requires 2 million yuan per team, and the latter requires 500,000 yuan, both of which must be raised within one month to meet urgent needs.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts in Shanghai: Learning from the British Tenth Son</p>
<p>Having finished reading "A Glimpse of England," one is filled with endless emotions. For the sake of the British Empire's glory, the British people endured seven years of war. Although the Germans were defeated, the power of the British Empire is visibly declining. In Europe and the Far East, the British Empire's flag has had to sadly lower, giving way to nations with expanding power. (You surely know who!)</p>
<p>However, post-war disasters, poverty, and hunger are eroding this nation. The British people have always been steadfast in enduring hardship and not shying away from difficulties. Having weathered a long war, can this new economic crisis and tide of hunger engulf the British people?</p>
<p>Food is scarce, and clothing is tattered. The ration coupons allotted to each person are insufficient to provide a family with warmth and sustenance. A university professor has become gaunt and emaciated, and a famous scholar lives a life of poverty. Parents give all the food they can spare to their children.</p>
<p>The British are weeping and lamenting. Post-war poverty is giving this nation its greatest test. They are not incapable of reaching out for more money, but the more foreign debt they borrow, the more the British Empire's sphere of influence shrinks. Should they greedily pursue temporary comfort and recklessly take on foreign debt? Those gold dollars are like a dose of poison, able to temporarily quench Britain's hunger and thirst, but if the poisoning is too deep, the British Empire will sacrifice its prestige and position. Are they willing to do so?</p>
<p>The British understand this deeply. They would rather everyone tighten their belts and become gaunt and emaciated than bow their heads and reach out to others again!</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the British Isles can maintain this fortitude!</p>
<p>Old Qiu (Churchill) put it well: the British people will surely reach the other shore, and the British nation will not collapse. Watching the British people suffer in tears, we should offer them our utmost respect.</p>
<p>But looking back at China's post-war situation, how much better is it than in Britain? A scene of disaster, a sea of tears. Extravagance and extravagance have not been banned. Mentioning the ban on dancing seems to cause nationwide panic. A banquet costing millions of yuan is considered insufficiently grand. A dress costing three million yuan is still considered shabby. These decadent, ignorant, and clueless people are everywhere.</p>
<p>Poverty and hunger are many times worse than in the British Isles, but the singing and fast melodies in theaters and dance halls cannot cover up the weeping of the entire Chinese people!</p>
<p>Look at the British and take them as our example.</p>
<h3>Free Talk A Glimpse of England Translated by Yang Honglie</h3>
<p>"The guarantee of peace and freedom relies on the mutual support and cooperation of Britain and America. The unity of the English-speaking nations is enough to resist any external aggression. Only with military force can there be peace. If we have a dignified and unassailable presence, enemies will not dare to underestimate us."</p>
<p>He firmly holds this view, so he once raised his arms and called for the timely conclusion of a British-American military alliance. He believes that perhaps only strong military force can maintain world peace.</p>
<p>Will Reach the Other Shore</p>
<p>I have heard President Roosevelt express his admiration for Mr. Churchill several times. When I mentioned it, Mr. Churchill led me to an exquisite bookshelf. Mr. Churchill pointed out a card to me with Lincoln's Gettysburg Address printed on it. Below it were the words left by President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill during the Yalta Conference: "I deeply wish to travel further with you and to happily meet again soon." But who knew that the Yalta Conference would be the last meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, and that these words would become a permanent farewell!</p>
<p>"Mr. Churchill!" I said, "Britain is in suffering, and people are saying that only if the whole country is united in hardship and endurance can it overcome the difficulties."</p>
<p>"But, no matter what," he said, "Britain is not a country that can collapse. Having endured countless hardships, it will eventually reach the other shore. Let me show you something else."</p>
<p>He led me to see some designs for floating harbors, the powerful tools that aided the Normandy landings. Nazi military strategists were greatly troubled by these elusive and unpredictable objects.</p>
<p>Included was the related documentation. Initially, the engineering experts reported to the Prime Minister that it was absolutely impossible to design a floating harbor. Next, I saw Mr. Churchill's rough and firm handwriting in the order:</p>
<p>"Don't argue with me, go argue with your difficulties!"</p>
<p>After a long period of research and experimentation, the impossible problem was finally solved, but today Britain is facing a new and dangerous crisis.</p>
<p>As I left Chartwell Manor, I watched the portly figure in the air-raid suit waving goodbye. Under his hand, several masterpieces revered by artists were drawn, and he also commanded the army and navy to march to victory. In the misty evening, I thought that only with courage and perseverance can one move towards light and victory!</p>
<p>Many Post-War Disasters</p>
<p>What are the difficulties in Britain's path to recovery?</p>
<p>I spoke with Mr. Niel, one of the most capable officials in the Labor government, and one of Foreign Secretary Bevin's most trusted aides, about this issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Niel mentioned that millions of dollars in loans had disappeared like flowing water, and that even more dollar aid was needed, but the Labor Party's recovery plan had yet to achieve anything. The expansion of state-owned enterprises had also not benefited government finances. People mostly lamented their hardship, enduring the cold all day long and living a monotonous and dull life. They had been burdened with extremely heavy taxes and rents for seven years, and the situation could not be improved. It was indeed difficult for a country to recover its vitality after the war.</p>
<p>Mr. Niel seemed somewhat surprised and interested in my questions.</p>
<p>"Britain's underground coal reserves are extremely abundant, enough for the whole country to use, but why is it not easy to develop them?"</p>
<p>"Although the number of workers is slowly increasing, the working environment is indeed too harsh. After the mines were nationalized, people thought that the equipment should be modernized. Many people returned to the mines, but production is decreasing day by day. Indeed, many workers are also leaving!"</p>
<p>"Why are workers leaving one after another?"</p>
<p>"Basically, it's because life is too monotonous. A worker who earns a few extra pennies wanders in front of some empty stores. They only feel the pain of having money but nowhere to spend it."</p>
<p>Moreover, after seven years of hard labor, they cannot eat their fill all day long. Post-war there has been widespread disaster, frost and floods, causing us to lose two million sheep - and of course, food and wool are lost along with them. Thirty thousand cattle have also been killed or injured, and 500,000 acres of farmland have been washed away by floods, with 70,000 acres of rice and wheat suffering losses. Eight thousand tons of potatoes were also destroyed along with everything else."</p>
<p>"Your opposition party is talking about how you have painted a vision of a wealthy and prosperous future for all the British people, but I think you would be embarrassed to tell them that hope will turn into nothing."</p>
<p>"We have done our best. We promised the people housing, but after the war, everything needs to be rebuilt, and it is difficult to achieve that at present. The road ahead is full of thorns, and it is possible that rations will be even smaller and life will be even harder in the future. We will openly tell the people to share the difficulties and get through the hard times together!"</p>
<p>To Revive the Nation</p>
<p>Not far from Cambridge University, I met the famous Christian Professor Li Wu. His elderly mother was unable to move due to illness, and the family could not afford to hire another servant. In addition to serving his mother, he also had to take care of household chores. Whenever he had some free time, he would sit down and grade his students' homework.</p>
<p>He talked about how the young people of Britain are working hard in their studies, seeing that their homeland is scarred and that it is their responsibility to revive the nation!</p>
<p>On the Queen Elizabeth, a breeze brought the salty smell of the ocean, unconsciously stirring up a sense of nostalgia, mixed with some inexplicable emotions. I thought of sending three sets of woolen underwear to someone in London, and the recipient received them as if they were treasures, thanking me profusely, followed by a burst of tears. I thought of a group of ragged and thin parents who distributed all their ration coupons to their children, and university professors who are busy with household chores all day long, and then immediately attend to their seriously ill mothers.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I couldn't help but think of an old and familiar country song:</p>
<p>"Compatriots! Arise! Baden said,</p>
<p>Though I am slightly wounded, I am not dead!</p>
<p>Let me lie down and catch my breath for a moment,</p>
<p>Let the fresh blood soak through my shirt,</p>
<p>After a moment,</p>
<p>I will rise up,</p>
<p>And run back to the battlefield!" (End)</p>

<p>Random Notes on America by Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>In America, traffic police are rarely seen. Traffic lights are automatic, and the automobile class can obey the rules, so traffic police are unnecessary. Municipal authorities can also save an expense. Although Shanghai also has automatic traffic lights, it still relies on the great effort of the police to switch them. In addition, the rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers are of too low a standard and cannot obey traffic rules, so the police also have to bother to lift their seat cushions. This is a farce in traffic management. In America, it is customary for cars to wait for people. When people cross the road, cars stop and wait for pedestrians to pass. In China, it is people who wait for cars. Looking around to see if there are any cars speeding by, they dare to run across the road like a wild boar. The disregard for traffic rules by our country's automobile class is indirectly disrespectful to traffic police. The alternating time of automatic traffic lights is fixed, so whether you take a car or walk from home to the office, you can calculate the time in advance and will not be squeezed at the corner of the road, waiting for fifteen minutes. When cars pass schools and hospitals, it is customary not to honk their horns. School or hospital authorities erect a warning sign in the middle of the road, usually a small aluminum or wooden figure of a child. You can see a child standing in the middle of the road from afar, with the word "Attention, School" written on it. We know that we are approaching a school and automatically slow down. It is difficult to ensure that children will not cross the road during school hours. This is an unwritten law that car owners automatically abide by and never joke with human lives. In America, it is illegal to cut in front of other cars. Even on wide highways, you cannot cut in front of them at will. American highways have a particularly wide section every few miles. If you want to cut in front, you have to drive to that particularly wide section, and you must honk your horn loudly beforehand to let the cars in front know to be prepared. There is a traffic patrol team on American highways riding motorcycles to investigate those who do not comply with the regulations. The speed limit on the outskirts is 40 miles per hour, 25 miles per hour in the suburbs, 15 miles per hour in the business district, and no more than 5 miles per hour near schools or hospitals. If you violate the regulations and are detected by the patrol team, even if they do not arrest you on the spot, they will copy down your car number, predict where you will pass, and call the patrol station ahead. The police will already be standing in the middle of the road with their motorcycles, blocking your way. If your car passes any important intersection, an undercover traffic policeman will copy down your number. If you hit someone on the highway and think that you have not been seen, you can escape, but the police will compare all the car numbers and passing times, making it impossible for you to deny it. If you try to quibble, they can use various lie detectors to expose you. (42)</p>
<p>Coolness of Early Autumn Compiled by the Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>(Guangxu 21st Year, August 10th)</p>
<p>This summer's climate, although not the hottest, is still miserable in the midst of a housing shortage. Even not being hot is a torment, let alone during the scorching summer. Now that autumn has arrived, the people of Shanghai all hope that the temperature will drop soon. If it could be like it was fifty years ago, everyone would be very happy.</p>
<p>"Since the past ten days, the climate in Shanghai has been extremely hot. Whenever one is in the shade of the paulownia trees, playing chess in the bamboo courtyard, or sitting by a clean desk and bright window, unable to weave due to the heat, one still feels sweat dripping down. Let alone driving a car on a vast road, bearing a long journey... At 2:22 AM on the 18th, it was the Beginning of Autumn solar term. Therefore, those who suffer from the heat are happily rejoicing, saying that from now on they can 'escape from the dust and dirt and cool their souls in Taiwan.' That night, at the third watch of the drum, suddenly there was a sound like a tiger roaring, and the crimson gauze windows shook incessantly. Soon after, there was a clanging sound, and the metal all chimed. The Wind God and Rain Master had already arrived side by side, fully displaying their supernatural powers, sweeping away countless flames of heat in the vast world, which is truly a delightful thing..."</p>
<p>The Naughty Cat, A-Mi (6) by Zhang Leping</p>
<p>Social Service: Cancer is Mostly of Two Malignant Types</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Meiting:</p>
<p>We have read the letter forwarded to us by the Shen Bao Social Service Department, detailing your symptoms. In principle, we should have answered you sooner, but because there are too many people inquiring, we have been putting it off until now. We are truly uneasy about making you wait so long, please forgive us! We are now answering your questions as follows:</p>
<p>Indeed, as you said, it is uncommon for a 21-year-old youth to have cancer. However, I must tell you that there are two types of cancer. One is the commonly known cancer, Carcinoma, and the other is Sarcoma (muscle tumor?). This type of Sarcoma can occur in childhood and is very malignant. If you have this type, then there is no way to think of it. Regarding the treatment of cancer, there is currently no effective treatment method. So-called radium and X-rays are only a "comparative" type of treatment. We feel very sorry that there is still no effective medicine for the treatment of cancer. However, we very much hope that there may be achievements in the research of atomic energy in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding nutrition, we believe that you can take any kind, as long as it is easily digestible and nutritious enough. We wish you good health!</p>

<p>To Mr. Zhu Dexing of Shanghai: Your letter has been received. (1) Whether your friend Mr. Gu has a lung disease should be checked with an X-ray, and the sputum he spits out can also be tested. There are many capillaries in the throat, and occasional blood spots in the sputum may not be caused by pulmonary tuberculosis. Even if it is a lung disease, if it can be treated early, eight or nine out of ten can be cured, so there is no need to be afraid. (2) You are suspected of having chronic appendicitis, and we hope you will seek medical treatment.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 20th] President Truman stated in his mid-year budget review tonight: The total government expenditure for this year will be $37 billion, a $500 million decrease from the $37.528 billion estimated in January. When revenues and expenditures are offset at the end of the fiscal year on June 30th of next year, a surplus of $4.7 billion is expected.

<h3>Japanese Three Parties Issue Statement: Decide to Support Katayama Cabinet</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Following the Liberal Party's aggressive statement against the Katayama government, the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative Parties, in order to stabilize public sentiment, issued a joint statement stating: Since its establishment, the Katayama Cabinet's policies have consistently followed the four-party policy agreement, advancing towards national salvation with the aim of achieving economic recovery and stabilizing the people's livelihoods. However, the Liberal Party has not shown any cooperation since the Katayama Cabinet was established. The Liberal Party's announcement of the abolition of the four-party policy agreement will have virtually no impact. On the contrary, with the Liberal Party's stance clarified, the dark clouds in Japanese political circles can be swept away. In the future, the three ruling parties will further cooperate to support the Katayama Cabinet and advance towards national salvation.</p>

<h3>Japan Owes Foreign Debt: Totaling Over Four Hundred Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>Five Hundred Million Dollar Loan Not Included</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Japan's outstanding foreign debt, including principal and interest, totals over four hundred million US dollars.
