<h3>我公布致魏使文件　說明安定政經所採步驟　決心克服危機完成憲政</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我政府曾於八月十六日以說明書一件送交魏德邁特使，解說安定政治，經濟所採步驟，及克服當前危機，推進憲政之決心，（一）共產黨武力必須使之消滅。（二）控制通貨膨脹，決不容再緩。（三）在不受共禍省份，加緊經濟復興，地方政府同時爲必要之改革。該項文件外交部昨（十四日）於京滬兩地同時公布，原文如下：</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍到華後，曾以節略一件遞交我國政府，略謂：徵諸過去事實，中國政府曾於一九二七至一九三七年之間，在政治·經濟·敎育·社愈等方面施行各種有建設性之揹施，倘非受戰爭之阻撓，上述措施必能使中國成爲一强大統一之國家，爲便利其此行工作起見，彼深願中國政府提一說明書，解釋其勝利以後對於恢復政治，經濟安定所採取之步驟，因此，中國政府於八月十六日將下列說明書一件交與魏德邁將軍。</p>
<p>關於中國政府措施與政策之一般說明</p>
<p>一，戰勝利之日，中國政府面臨下列各項問題：</p>
<p>（一）中國共產黨問題，彼輩除擁有正規軍隊卅一萬人外，尚有所謂「民軍」，爲數更多。大批未投降繳械之日僞軍隊存在於東北，復予中共以機會取得更多較精之裝備。</p>
<p>（二）長期抗戰所造成之通貨膨脹，危及全國經濟生活。</p>
<p>（三）中國之鐵路，百分之九十以上完全停頓，內河航輪極端缺乏，因之，復員及恢復日偽佔領區秩序工作非常困難，戰前之工礦業，其工廠雖多已收回，但亦多因此而無法復工。</p>
<p>（四）農村經濟經過八年之荒廢與敵僞之破壞，遂致工人·牲畜·肥料·呈普遍缺乏現象，農業生產因之銳减，亟需加以恢復。例如每年棉花生產由一九三七年之一千六百十八萬市担，减至五百卅二萬市担，即僅及戰前產量三分之一。</p>
<p>（五）中國本部有百萬以上之日軍，其在東北者數目亦約相同。僞軍六十萬分布於中國本部各地，又有卅三萬人散居東北。因蘇聯參加遠東戰爭之故，蘇聯亦有六十至七十萬人之軍隊分駐東北各地。</p>
<p>（六）最後則爲政府在戰前及戰時政治諾言之實行問題，國民大會之召集，憲法草案之擬定，國民黨之還政於民，一黨政治之結束，以及新聞檢查制度之取銷，均爲政府亟須實踐之重大諾言</p>
<p>以上所述困難問題，均爲日本投降之日，政府必須同時着手解決者，責任之重，原非當時政府原有機構之能力所能應付裕如。蓋凡此問題，不徒其本身甚爲重要而複雜，且頗多爲政府前此所未嘗經歷之事。</p>
<h3>兩五阻力存在　復員建設困難</h3>
<p>二，中國政府在遣送日本士兵僑民，以及自海空兩方面運兵往各地趕辦接收工作之時，深得駐華美軍之協助，聯合國善後救濟總署及行政院善後救濟總署對遣送難民及其他急需舉辦之救濟善後事宜，實有甚大之貢獻。同時，中國政府本身在環境許可之限度內，已曾盡其全力，以求取各種問題之解決。第一，着手於軍隊之整編與財政之緊縮。第二，圖交通事業之恢復，例如鐵路，公路，水道，公用事業，水利事業之修復。第三，致力於工業即礦業及鐵廠之復工（包括十部分在東北被共軍拆卸或共產黨破壞者在內），與紡織業及其他瀕於危殆之工業之拯救。第四，致力於政治基層組織之建立，例如地方鄉鎭保甲之組織以及各級學校之復員與重建。第五，對於農村經濟，政府亦曾儘可能以助其恢復。即就棉花而言，政府在過去一年半之推廣工作，預計今年可使產棉達一千一百萬市担，較抗戰勝利之年已增加一倍，凡此工作，均需要不少之人材，管理與經濟。</p>
<p>吾人如評判政府在此一時期之工作，必須念及中國社會基礎向不健全，且其大部分土地曾經多年之淪陷，戰前即一九二七年以來所建立之初步新經濟基礎，亦爲敵軍所摧毀，在勝利以後，其恢復工作，實甚艱辛而複雜。</p>
<p>倘政府在復員建設方面之努力如無下列兩大阻力之存在，則必能收得更大之效果，中國現在之政治經濟情形，亦必較爲光明。所謂兩大阻力，即共產黨問題之久而未決與戰時遺留下來之通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>中國共產黨在蘇軍佔領東北時及佔領以後之參入該地，構成勝利後共黨問題僵特之一大因素。共黨之武裝敵對，乃政府復員工作恢復治安秩序時最大之阻撓，在收復區域爲尤甚。例如政府一面多方設法恢復主要交通綫，而共黨軍隊則極力從事破壞工作，拆毀新修復之鐵路，切斷電報電話綫，蹂躪鄉間。</p>
<p>共產黨因政府未能在東北接收日僞軍隊之投降並解除其武裝，其態度乃日趨强硬。去年年底國民大會開會後，共黨更公開反對大會所通過之憲法，政治解決之途，至是顯然絕望。蓋此時共黨已決定立即舉行大規模軍事總攻，當此各項建設工作正需政府聚精會神迅速開始之際，而竟遭遇此種局勢，政府之困難與失望，實無以復加。</p>
<p>共黨問題旣懸而不決，軍隊整編計劃，亦因共黨不肯履行而未能實現，軍隊縮編乃不能不受到打擊，因之，財政緊縮政策遂無法實施，通貨乃隨之繼續膨脹。至危及中國之整個政治經齊生活，政府行政效率爲之减低，軍隊士氣受其影響，大多數公務員所得之薪給，甚至不能維持最低限度之生存，若干政府人員至被迫兼操他業以維持生活，其他若干公務員則逕棄官而轉就其他收入較多之位置。直至今日，窮困已久之公務員，其待遇仍未能切實改善，然而極大多數公務員雖在生活如此艱困之下，却仍奉公不懈，此乃至可驚嘆之事。此等公務員之忠誠，實與抗敵期間中國民衆忍受痛苦之堅毅精神互相比擬。</p>
<h3>樹立憲政制度　政府從未中輟或稍懈　在方法上容不免有若干缺點</h3>
<p>三，一般人對國民政府儘可作種種批評，但決不能指責其對孫中山先生所規劃之民主政治未曾盡力從事準備。國民黨中一切負責人士，一向均認爲國民黨倘不能樹立代表全民之政府與容許多黨存在之政治，則可謂尙未實行國民黨之基本黨綱。几在黨中稍有地位者，莫不以爲一旦中山先生所指示之基本條件具備以後，「訓政」即須結束，整個國民黨從未背離此一基本政治信念。</p>
<p>一九三七年中日戰爭爆發，全國上下除堅決抗敵外，並盡力保全自一九二七年以來在政治·經濟上所樹立之基礎。國民黨中一般意見均以爲，戰爭雖然存在，國民黨前次害行憲政之準備工作，不可任令戰事毀壞。因之，一九三八年政府即召集國民參政會，使政府獲得更多數人之意見，以助國策之推行。除有關軍事策略者外，該會成爲戰時之全國民意機關。當此民族作生死掙扎之際，國民黨竟提前開放政權，接受外間公開之質詢與批評。直至今日，此種庶政公諸輿論之制度仍在繼續發展，第一屆參政員二百人，雖均係國民政府根據職業及地理分配原則所遴選之人，但一般人公認其確能代表全國有政治意識之各階層。一九四零年初，第二屆參政會開會時，有參政員二百四十人，其中九十餘人係首次由各省市臨時參議會根據地理及職業基礎而選出者。一九四二年第三屆參政會開會時，二百四十人之中，由各省市選出者達一百六十四人。目前該會在行將結束之際，共有參政員三六二人，其中二二七人係由各省市參議會選出者。</p>
<p>一九三八年九月，即第一屆參政會開幕二月之後，國民政府即頒布臨時省參議會法規，此種議會現時在所有省份幾皆成立，其民選議員之人數，每屆均有增加，現時若干省之參議員有完全出自民選者，市縣參議會亦曾依照類似辦法而成立，是以當國家抗戰軍事至上之際，政府對於憲政制度之樹立與推進，曾繼續盡力，從未中輟或稍懈。</p>
<p>日本投降之後，新聞檢查制度雖有多種繼續存在之理由，但政府已斷然予以取銷，一九四六年十一月復召國民大會，通過憲法草案，國民黨雖仍爲政府中之多數黨，但一黨政府從此告終，育年黨及民主社會黨均已參加政府，在今日之中國，國民公意之表現，已有衆多之組織，而爲前所未有者，凡屬熟悉中國過去情形之觀察家，必能注意及此。此種現象之造成，係由於新聞檢查之取消，國民大會之召集，其他黨派之參加政府，行政院負責之施行，以及國民參政會之公開討論，同時，政府對其政策及施政之愛護，又足以促成輿論之發達，使政府與人民更爲接近。</p>
<p>國民黨自執政以來，爲達到其政治目標起見，在方法上容不免有若干缺點，但國民黨從未背離其一貫的政治動向，其工作之進展，間或不免因環境之困難而遲滯，但在國民黨執政之廿年中，几向前推進一步即算一步，從無進而復退之事。</p>
<h3>幅員廣袤　基礎薄弱</h3>
<p>批評家不可忽略</p>
<p>四，批評中國之人士，往往忽視中國幅員之廣裏，政治，經濟及社會組織茲礎之薄弱，及其內在各種問題之複雜，其觀察及判斷，每每爲某一特殊時期之現象所壟斷，而忘却其背景。</p>
<p>一九二七迄一九三七年，乃國民然力量首次遭受試騐之時期，在此時期內，政府從未事受六個月以上之太平，吾人茲姑將此十年情形略加檢討，一九二六年政府尚在廣州時，即興師討伐北方軍閥，一九二七年國民政府建都南京後，軍閥猶未肅淸，舊勢力之殘餘份子以及共產黨人時時在陰謀作亂，在當時之重慶即後來之戰時首都，出售鴉片之公開店舖尚遍於各街。不惟重慶，即其他全國多數省市亦幾多如此，外人之治外法權尚繼續存在”諸大國甚至美國，對國民政府尚抱冷淡與懷疑之態度，自一九三一年九月十八日日本公開侵略以後，政府一面須抵抗侵略，一面須剿平共產黨在南方各地之武力叛亂，然政府在此內外夾攻，困難重重之十年中，竟亦能展開全國建設工作，迨至戰前即一九三七年時，新築鐵路幾達五千公里，新造公路近十萬公里，並在各地添建學校，公園，醫院，及市政中心區，中學增加三倍，專科以上學校增加兩倍，一九三六年中學及職業學校學生人數已近六十萬人，十年間文盲减低約百分之二十，新式兵工廠製造亦發韌於一九二六年，至蘆溝橋事變時，中國之兵工廠已能自行全部供給涉兵部隊所需用之步槍，手溜彈，機關槍，迫擊砲及其種種附件。禁毒運動亦係於比時期普遍展開，毒犯人數因之迅速减少，迨至一九三八年底，在國民黨政府統制下之各地，已無公開之鴉片烟店矣。</p>
<p>一九三七年，全面戰爭爆發時，日本財政專家預料，中國財政在幾個月以內必將崩潰，八年抗戰期內，中國所遭遇之財政問題，誠屬艱鉅複雜，然政府因在戰前曾採取若千强有力之措施，諸如創用法幣，集中現金之準備，改革租稅及銀行制度，故能渡過戰事最初期（亦即戰事最危險時期），而未發生任何嚴重之財政危機。</p>
<p>簡之之，自一九二七年國民政府建都南京迄一九三七年抗日戰事開始，此一階段係國民黨遭受嚴重試騐之時期，在此時期政府雖受有內外不斷之威脅與困難，但目標至爲單純，即對內剿討禍國殃民之共產黨，對外抵抗日本帝國主義之侵略，意志統一，力量集中，而當時中國與其各鄰邦之關係亦不似今日之複雜，故終竟能使此一時期成爲一建設時期，工商業皆有發展，城市及鄉村之人民，僉能對其前途從事計劃，寄託希望，一九三六年之工業生產，較以前任何時期爲高，一般社會均有欣欣向榮之感。</p>

<h3>消滅共黨武力　保持遠東和平　通貨膨脹必設法控制</h3>
<p>今日政府所遭遇之種種問題，乃較抗戰以前更為複雜，但其陰惡困難之情形，則與一九三七年至一九四二年中國被迫單獨抗日之時期相類似，國民黨所領導之現政府，是否仍能如戰前及戰時一樣，克服各種新危險及困難，尚待事實證明。</p>
<p>不過，國民黨及現政府，準備克服此種新危機之瘊心，毫未減弱，則甚明顯。至於準備應付比危機之政策如何，茲亦中就政府所特別注意者簡單述之：第一，共產黨武力必須使之消滅，政府之此一決定與其成敗，不僅關係政府身身之命運，即中國之能否即整個遠東之和平及安全能否保持，亦繫於此，故政府決不願考慮任何不澈底之辦法。第二，通貨膨脹必須設法加以控制，有效控制辦法縱須逐步實施，但實施之開始決不容再緩，蓋此事乃各種政治，經濟與社會病態之根。第三，在不受共黨危害之各省份，政府應盡其力量之可能，加緊經濟復興工作，地方政府亦將同時爲必要之改革。最後，政府將以百折不撓之精神，向樹立憲政之鵠的邁進，不論共黨叛亂及其他政治因素對此事之達成能製造何種困難，政府仍準備實施去年通過之慮法，理想之民主憲政，誠非旦夕可以造成，但政府內一般之意見，皆以爲達到此目標之上策，厥爲儘速使憲政開始。</p>

<h3>雷震談我對和會立場　應力促蘇聯參加　俾使和會目的得以實現</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政務委員亞東協會理事雷震氏昨與記者談，對日和約問題渠認和會之程序與和約之內容，應由四强會議先行商定，再交遠東委員會十一國會議討論，關於和會，雷氏謂我國應竭力促使蘇聯參加，若果蘇聯拒絕參加，我國自亦勢難出席，蓋和會如無蘇聯參加東北問題，朝鮮問題均難解決，和會之目的將因此不能實現。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外交界息，我國已向遠東委員會要求，將來在日本總賠償額中，我國應得百分之四十，惟迄今尚未獲通過，美國原則上贊同我國多獲賠償，但希望能將百分比略减。英國則表示反對，因此項要求如獲通過，則大英帝國自治領衆多，每一單位所得之百分率將甚少。蘇聯亦不表贊同，關鍵在海外資產問題。中英美諸國均主張日本海外屬地之資產及在佔領區內之投資，均應列爲賠償品，而蘇聯則堅持此類物資應解釋爲戰利品，由佔領軍獲得。此項爭議迄未獲得解決。</p>

<h3>白部長在四中全會　軍事報告全文（三續）</h3>
<p>（二）敎育制度：優良之軍官激育制度，爲建軍之　　，本部成立以來，對敎育制度之改善，特加注意，茲將策定之敎育制度與實施要點，分述如左：1·軍官敎育制度訂定之原則，以提高軍官對科學之紫養，與培養，海陸空軍一元化之統帥與幕僚爲主，其他如加强聯勤訓練，與專門技術訓練，及培植預備軍官，均爲主要着限。2·軍官敎育之階層，分爲軍官養成敎育，深造敎育，專級幕僚敎育，及最高國防敎育四者：一，軍官養成敎育階層中，設立海陸空聯勤統一敎育之軍官學校，幷設軍官訓練理，建立預備軍官訓練團，以培養國防軍之基本幹部。二，傑造敎育，則由各軍中設立兵科學校。三，高級幕僚敎育爲參謀學校，由國防部管轄。四，最高國防敎育爲國防大學，訓練優秀軍宮及文富，使成高級軍事人才及國防經濟技術專家，由國防部管轄。此外視需要設立各特種學校，施以特業　練，並成立軍事科學硏究院，聘請科學專家從事硏究。3·關於實施槪况：軍官學校及軍官訓練班、現已開始籌備成立陸軍聯動各兵科學校，今（三十六）年秋成立初級班，預定明（三十七）年成立高級班，海軍空軍學校亦籌備中，參謀學校已開始籌劃，今（三十六）年冬可期成立，國防大學，預定於三十九年成立，軍事科學院已與敎育部商洽，先委託各普通大學辦理中。</p>
<p>（三）補給制度：補給制度之良否，直接影響官兵之保育，間接與第一綫之戰鬥力有關，亦爲軍事制度之重要部份，本部曾對加以精密之設計，以期建立良好之補給制度，茲　述如左：一，財務與經理分立，過去財物併由軍需人員經理，現仿會訂立法之精神，將財務與經理分立爲兩個系統，人員與機構均明白劃分，各專其責。二，預算與財務分立，仿照主計職掌分歲計會計之原則，本部及以，下各級機關部隊，均分別設置預算人員，辦理預算編審，分配，監督，及支出前之查核簽證，與事後之按期報告，於是本部得以完全控制預算。至會計收支事，由財務部門主管，並實行軍需獨立，使業務單位，不管金錢出納，尤厲行公庫制度，藉使會計制度納於正軌。三，推行實物補給，此項制度，推行已久，現仍在力求澈底改進中，凡軍事器材，糧服，裝具，燃料等，皆力求實物補給。以免委託部隊，諸感不便，或滋生弊端，而其實行，尤採取不待各方請求，而主管者按照規定計劃，實施補給。四，負兵人數力求　實，軍隊吃空，積弊甚深，迭經糾正，尚覺難以淸除，本部爲澈底力矯此弊，最近更製定人事日報表一種，以後一切給與補給，均以日報表數字爲凖，如能順利實施，吃空之弊當可根除，同時幷擬定人馬點騐辦法表，厲行點騐，俾與表報辦法相輔而行。</p>
<p>丁　關於剿匪槪況</p>
<p>（一）共匪一般情况：共匪蓄謀顚覆政府，分裂國家，已舉國同憤，勿容贅述，彼在抗戰時間，專門攻擊友軍，於日本投降後，復憑藉外方，得日械之供給，幷脅從人民爲匪，其目下情形如左：總兵力約八六〇·一五〇人，野戰部隊六一三·一五〇人，軍區部隊二四七·〇〇〇人，關外約四四四。〇〇〇人，關內約四一六·一五〇人。</p>

<h3>設身處地替中國想一想！</h3>
<p>魏德邁將軍離華以後，在檀香山整理資料，將向美總統報告此行結果。我國政府爲使魏特使易於明瞭我國的實際情形起見，曾於特使離華之前，面交備忘錄一件；董新聞局長顯光，昨日自京來滬，向報界發表這個外交部的備忘錄。</p>
<p>在這個備忘錄裏，中國政府率直指出戰後所遭遇的各種困難，並坦白承認戰後建國復興的不易，但也表示出政府對於復興建國確懷有不可動搖的決心。</p>
<p>我們要美國朋友，設身處地，替中國想一想。中國是一個農業國家，而且是一個落後的農業國家；在抗戰期間，生產最豐富的農業區，均淪陷在日軍的佔領之下，受敵偽的摧殘與破壞。八年以來，中國的農業經濟，早已瀕於破產的境地，不論是人力牲畜或肥料，無一不發牛既乏的現象，農業生產方式的改進，更加談不到。所以到了勝利之後，卽使沒有共產黨問題發生，加深了農村經濟的衰落，也不能一時就恢復我國的農業生產。戰後中國民食問題的嚴重，決非偶然的。何况在抗戰勝利之後，未獲得喘息的機會，共產黨問題接鍾而起，共匪除擁有卅餘萬的正規軍而外，並有許多所謂「民軍」，不僅稱兵作亂，企圖擴充其地盤，而且在全國各地，均有其黨徒搗亂破壞，使人民不能安居樂業，以企圖從而奪取政權。共匪知道交通是國家的命脈，故在各地破壞鐵路交通，全國的鐵路有百分之九十陷於停頓狀態，內河航運又因輸船的缺乏與地方的不靖，也不能通暢。共匪又知道礦產與農村是國家唯一的資源，故在各地盡其搗亂的能事，使礦產不能開採，農民不能安心耕種。在這種情形之下，怎能使中國在物資方面不感到匱乏的恐慌？</p>
<p>以言目前中國的國民經濟，最大的困難，乃在通貨膨服的漫無止境。這種現象的造成，不能不說是八年抗戰與兩年內亂的結果。中國在抗戰期間，孤軍奮鬥，外援不繼，在經濟上不得不完全靠發行紙幣來維持。在這八年之中，別的支出不算，單以軍費一項而論，也就着實可觀。我國爲了執行抗戰國策，造成通貨膨脹，全國人民的生活雖直接受其威脅，但沒有怨言。抗戰勝利後，政府本可着手整理或改革幣制，以安定國內的金融：不料共產黨又蓄意造成兩年來的內亂。因爲有共匪的存在，軍隊整編計劃無法實行，因此緊縮政策也就徒托空言，通貨之繼續膨脹，造成目前的情形。在表面上看來，政府對於目前情勢的造成，似乎應該負其全責；但是按之實際，確應歸咎於日寇與共匪。現在日寇已被打倒，應由其賠償我國的損失；但是對日和會遙遙無期，賠償問題又一時不能解決，我們就無法取得補償。同時共匪問題，因爲以前爲「和談」所誤，此際也不是短期內所能解決，因此不明眞相者展望我國經濟前途，自不免發出悲觀的論調。</p>
<p>美國位於西半球，雖然也曾一度參戰，犧牲了不少的人力與物力，但是其國內並未直接遭受戰爭的浩刦：故在戰後，仍爲人間的極樂世界。「飽人不知餓人饑」，凡是不能設身處地替中國想一想的人，就不會深切體念中國所遭過的困難與痛苦。我們不願再有所費詞，也不願再存什麽專賴外援的心理，但我們依然相信中美兩國是具有敦睦的悠久歷史，而美國對於遠東和平的締造更有其道義上的責任，故探願美國胡野看了我國的備忘錄之後，能够設身處地替中國想一想：中國的困難是不是一個久戰疲憊的國家所容易克服的？</p>
<h3>國民黨新生的考騐</h3>
<p>國民黨四中全會和中央黨團聯席會議十三日閉幕，三民主義靑年團團員今後將以國民黨黨員名義，共同致方於革命建設的工作。國民黨總裁旣在大會中指示了今後國民黨的任務和改革要點，中委宋子文等並建議組織同志互助協會，籌集基金，捐助爲抗戰及勦匪而殉難之黨員家屬，而宋氏更率先捐獻私產，將其本人所有中國建設銀公司之全部股份捐作此項基金之用；這不能不認爲是國民黨新生的象徵。大會宣言中說：「願以黨的團結和奮鬥促進黨的新生，以黨的新生創造革命的動力，以革命的動力達成政治經濟的全面改革」。我們極盼這幾句動聽的話，就從朱氏捐獻私產這種明智舉動做起，國民黨黨員大家眞能「拿事實來答覆期望，拿行動來證明決心。」爲了中國的前途，我們萬分期待國民黨的新生。</p>
<p>國民黨的領袖，在黨團聯席會議中作切實坦白的自我檢討，說明過去黨的成功在什麼地方，失敗又在什麽地方，說到最沉痛時，則深以愧對　總理孫先生爲言。若干外國記者聽到「失敗」二字，就紛相傳述，引爲驚異，以爲世界各國的政治家，從無公開承認「失敗」如這次國民黨總裁所言者。其實這就正是中國敎條「躬自原而薄責於人」的傳統美德，也正是國民黨每遭一次險阻而終能克服的精神甚礎，並且西諺本有「失敗爲成功之母」的話，故縱使失敗亦不足爲患，而况今日國民黨黨員團結振作，在國家剿匪戡亂期間，果能始終爲民前鋒，則國民黨的新生當有百分之百的把握，又何「失敗」之有？</p>
<p>今日中國的局勢，誠屬艱困萬分，一切一切的改革好像都是迫不及待，而實則轉危爲安和撥亂反正的樞紐，僅恃全國上下心理的一韓念之間。所謂「韓念」，卽「公爾忌私，國爾忘家」之謂。要全國人民心理作此一大轉移，自然首先要政府當局具此志向：而國民黨還是今日執政諸黨中的第一大黨，故惟有國民黨黨員的克己報國，始足以促進國民黨的新生，而國民黨的新生實卽爲全中國新生的礎石。國民黨的命運與中國的命運已經是分不開了。很簡單的，我們願先就這一件事，——國民黨有資力的黨員是否都能繼朱子文之後，各自捐獻其私產之全部或一部，以報効黨與國家？——作爲國民黨能否澈底新生的考騐。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾重申決心　擁護聯合國機構　願協力促進全世界安定</h3>
<p>〔k聯合社紐約十四日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今夜在美國聯合國同志會發表重要演說，闡明美國對於十六日聯合國大會之統盤政策，重申美國支持聯合國機構之決心，籲請聯大立即採取行動，以解除蘇聯巴爾幹衛星國對希臘獨立之直接威脅，並從速締結對日·德·奧等國和約。據稱，南保阿三國援助希臘遊擊隊，直接威脅該國之領土完整與政治獨立，吾人極表關切，而當與其他各會員國戮力抗拒此種侵略。美國除欲敎平巴爾幹亂事以外，別無他意，希望聯大能設法解決達到目的。美國所將支持聯合國者厥有二端：（一）即力求完成其餘各國和約，恢復聯合國機構得以盡職效勞之正常環境。另（一）即與各國合作，促進世界經濟局勢，實現國際安定所必需之經濟條件。但如謂每一國際問題應由聯合國機構處理，實屬嚴重錯誤。（按此言恐指其援歐復興計劃，蘇聯前曾指斥其不顧聯合國機構）。美國代表團將在大會中提案多件，盼能協助解決目前搗亂國際正常關係之若干間題，內中希臘與巴勒斯坦兩問題，吾人尤其注意。但聯合國機構設法克服對於諸共同問題獲致協議之各稱障礙時，決未耗竭其憲章中之潛力。美國並不認爲聯合國憲章否決權部份條款，有重大修正之必要。此外，目前取得會員資格時機已屆成熟之各國，美國希望早日准其加入聯合國機構。</p>
<h3>本屆聯合國大會　對遠東休戚相關　美可能將朝鮮等問題提出討論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕此間外交方面預測：本屆聯大會對於遠東人民之關係，將遠較去年大會爲重要。目前議程上重要題目集中於歐洲及中東事件，然測騐外交家之衆意，則有多人以爲在大會結束前，將有數項對遠東休戚有關之事項將被提起，此類事項涉及韓國·越南·印度·印尼·甚至又能包括日本。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕據權威方面今日訊，美國極可能建議將聯鮮問題，提交即將開幕之聯合國大會討論。據接近美代表團人士今晨告中央社記者稱，吾人可謂姜代表團刻正老慮是否有首先提出將朝鮮問題列入業已滿列交議事項之議程上之可能。</p>
<h3>聯大會會場　採嚴密戒備</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約弗魯辛十四日電〕聯合國由於最近安理會受到三次示威之驚嚇，十四日僱用特別警衛，並召來紐約市警察，對聯合國大會作嚴密保護。美國聯邦諷查團。及英國警察總盟部之密探。蘇聯之秘密警察，將就近保護各國代表。其中至少有十國代表團，包括五阿拉伯國家代表團在內，聞將派遣特別衛隊保護。蘇聯英國及沙地阿拉伯代表則自行携帶衛隊。</p>
<h3>賴依演說　檢討世界局勢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴爾鐵摩十四日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依今日在馬里蘭聯合國同志會宴會席上發表演說，題目爲「對於世界局勢之個人檢討」，據稱，前殖民地各民族解放運動，對於世界和平或將構成較大國間爭執更重大之威脅。和約未能平日締結，使聯合國機構工作蒙受妨碍，且稽延世界經濟復興。各大國間較諸一九二〇至一九三〇年間顯已互相接近，若干問題正由前殖民地民族解放運動取而代之，可能引起重大衝突。截至目前爲止，純粹軍事糾紛尚不多見，至少並未採取公開戰爭方式。渠希望下屆外長會議能對和約產生積極進展。所謂聯合國機構失敗，與其謂爲聯合國機構本身之失敗，毋寗謂爲各國未能親睦相處之失敗。諸君如果細心分析局勢，必能發現每一次談判每一次會議，已使各國對於互相諒解略有進展。</p>
<h3>各國代表　雲集紐約</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十三日電〕據聯合國總部估計，現已有近千餘名各國出席第二屆聯大會之代表抵達此間，預料尚有一千八百名代表及顧問將在十六日前可抵此。法總理賴瑪迪在四十八時內可趕到，蘇外次維辛斯基在十六日後可到。</p>
<h3>德境法佔區　須與英美區合併</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電〕反映法國外交部意見之「世界日報」今日稱：德境法軍區與英美區合併，已屬不能避免之事，故德國之被分爲東西兩大區已極可能。惟在四强外長會議於十一月間在倫敦舉行前，法國將不致決定德境法軍區之未來。「世界日報」指出法軍區人口六百萬，而英美區人口四千萬，故法軍區勢不能與英美區脫離云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯慶祝坦克節</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕莫斯科電台廣播：本日爲坦克節，蘇聯國防部長布爾加寗命令，蘇聯各邦首邑在十四日鳴砲二十發，以資慶祝。布氏並呼籲坦克廠工人集中力量及意識，光榮完成史達林同志賦予之工作，以增强武裝機械軍隊之力量。</p>
<h3>英駐匈軍事團　定今日結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社布達佩斯十四日電）此間昨夜宣布：英駐匈軍事團定九月十五日起結束，顯示英國已決定履行其於匈和約批准之日，立即退出匈國之決議。</p>
<h3>美勢難提前援歐　召開國會特會希望渺茫</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕美國國會提前召開特別會議以表決臨時緊急援歐案之希望，今日突轉渺茫。今有三種現象可以顯示馬歇爾國務卿及其專家之提前援歐計劃，並未得國會或內閣其他部份之全力支持：</p>
<p>（一）杜魯門總統自南美返國所乘主力艦「米蘇里」號上之隨行記者，皆謂總統並未改變渠赴巴西以前在記者招待會中所表示之意見，即「目前尚不能望見有充分之理由可以召集休假期內之參衆兩院議員返華盛頓」；（二）接近參院外交委員會主席范登堡之某負責人士亦謂范氏對於召開國會特別會議之機會，殊覺悲觀；（三）若干有聲望之議員均贊成杜魯門總統所稱國會並無召開特別會議必要之主張。共和黨財政權威柯洛拉多州參議員密列根表示對於召開特別會之議不願表示好　。參議員共和黨議員領袖魯加斯及其他若干民主黨議員亦均表示類似意見。歐洲國家駐美外交代表上星期聞悉馬歇爾力言歐局危急嚴重需要提早援助之語而產生之高度希望，已因前述各報告歸納而得之明顯結論而驟然降低矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕今日據悉，政府要員將俟杜魯門總統二十日返抵華府，隨即詳陳事實，說明歐洲經濟危機程度，俾便總統考慮局勢是否嚴重，且在數日內從速決定有無召開國會特別會議之理由。</p>
<h3>法義組共同委會　商關稅同盟</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電〕法國及義大利今日在法國外交部簽署宣言，表示願意開始研究建立法義關稅同盟之可能性。雙方已任命共同委員會，進行研究工作，務必於坏底以前向本國政府提出報告。此項宣言由法外長皮杜爾。義參加歐洲經濟會議代表團團長康比利代表雙方政府簽字。共同委員會並將研究法義兩國參加歐洲關稅同盟之可能性。</p>
<h3>美考慮以全部兵力　供聯合國機構調遣　力謀恢復該機構聲譽</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十四日電〕據悉，美國已在考慮以其全部陸海空軍，供聯合國機構調遣，以恢復世界各動亂區之和平與安全，包括希臘·巴勒斯坦·及印尼等，此一計劃乃美代表團在本屆聯大會中整個戰略之一部。馬歇爾國務卿今日在華盛頓已向內閣及聯大美代表團約略釋明此一計劃。觀察家僉認聯合國機構聲譽存毀，當繫於本屈聯大，美國此一軍事計劃之驚人性質，明晰表示美國已凖備使用其全力，以恢復聯合國機構之聲譽，必要時不惜以美國人民之生命爲恢復聯合國機構聲譽及地位之代價。</p>
<h3>美在格林蘭　設立雷達站　丹政府已予證實</h3>
<p>〔聯合社丹京十三日電〕關於美軍在丹麥境內設立用途不明之試騐站一節，今日業經官方證實。據格林蘭事務部長奧爾登諾甫告記者，共產黨報載美國在格林蘭設立雷達站，企圖　美軍空防，本部亦曾接獲同樣報告。截至目前爲止，美方未將其活動情形通知丹麥政府，外交部將進行調查此舉是否違反一九四一年丹麥協定。</p>
<h3>南羈留英美士兵　英美提嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕英外部發言人稱：英駐南斯拉夫大使比克，已向南政府提出照會，嚴重抗議義南邊界南當局之非法拘禁並虐待英美現役軍人。美國亦已於星期四夜就同一事件，向南國外交部提出嚴重抗議。</p>
<h3>義左派政黨　鼓勵大罷工</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十三日電〕義工人領袖已命令八十五萬金屬工人於十五日起罷工，此乃迫使加斯貝利政府退出之一部份運動。若罷工實行，將使米蘭，都林，及脫尼三地重工業陷於停頓。現有農民百萬餘人，及其他工人廿萬人亦在罷工。此次罷工乃與共黨在三天內向國民議會提出第二次不信任以現政府之動議相互呼應。</p>
<h3>蘇伊石油糾紛牽涉英美　伊朗處境極困難　最後伊朗或將被迫對蘇讓步</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十四日電〕伊朗總理蘇丹納宣稱：外傳英駐伊大使魯傑泰勸告伊朗政府於伊國會否決蘇聯伊朗石油協定時，仍保持談判門戶之開放之說，乃毫無根據之謠言。蘇丹納謂魯傑泰大使曾力言英國堅決反對干涉伊朗之事件，尤其是關於油權之事件。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕英外部發言人稱：英美在伊朗，具有同一的基本目標，即維護該國之土地完整。英美政策之方式容有不同，但目標則一。發言人並否認美國爲英駐伊朗大使魯傑泰勸告伊政府於伊國會批駁一九四六年四月所訂蘇聯伊朗石油協定後，仍保持談判門戶開放事已向英國提出抗議之說，華盛頓來電謂美國希望伊朗能採取更堅定之政第，並信英大使向伊政府提出之勸告，係恐蘇伊石油協定被駁後，英伊油公司在伊所享油權亦將被取消之故。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕外交觀察家稱，伊朗遲早將向蘇聯作石油問題及政治上之讓步。倫敦以爲伊朗之不能永久採取對蘇不親善態度，殆成定議。消息靈通外交人士稱，蘇聯如不能獲得伊朗之經濟讓步，可能採取軍事政治步驟，故英國已凖備考慮經濟方面之讓步。</p>
<h3>美敎會領袖　預言共黨將失敗</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美基督敎協會領袖之一迦孟博士在向陸長羅雅爾之正式報告中稱，渠今夏在歐洲遊歷，獲一印象，即蘇聯其欲逐逐，擬囊括歐洲及世界，其結果反將毀滅共黨。迦孟稱：「每人均屛息以待共產侵略者及民主國家間最後衝突之第一槍，美軍亦不例外。蘇聯刻正阻撓歐洲之建設並製造混亂，希望製造一『革命之環境』。歐洲之被壓迫人民明知蘇聯爲彼等受苦之根源，可能起而打倒共產黨人。即使人民不起而抗爭，上帝將代彼等報復。」按羅雅爾曾派遣十四位敎士赴歐視察，此爲渠所獲之第四份報告。</p>
<h3>日財部大火　重要文件全燬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十四日電〕財政部大厦昨夜發生大火，房屋及預算案等重要文件全部焚燬，但無死傷。救火車三十餘輛聞警趕到施援，財政部長來栖亦親臨火塲視察。據警局宣稱，起內恐係電爐熱度過高所致。「東京新聞」引鄰居與財政部下級職員語，則謂官員會議後常飲酒作樂，此次失愼乃自食其果。</p>
<h3>土肥原等戰犯　拒絕出庭作證</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕據　返國際戰犯法庭之人士告本社記者爾，著名之日本間諜（東北勞倫期）土肥原賢二，及其他一級戰犯十六人，成將拒絕出庭作證，蓋彼等恐懼在嚴峻之質詢下，口供有失也。</p>
<h3>我國將續派軍政官員　協助蔣家楝調查工作　荷蘭願予蔣氏種種便利</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十三日電〕荷蘭駐南京大使館今日宣布：荷政府業已知照中國政府，宣佈願以任何便利，供給中國駐吧城總領事蔣家棟，使其得根據安理會之決議，以領事團團員之身份，進行調查停戰令執行狀况之工作。中國將續派軍政官員，協助蔣氏之調查工作。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞十三日電〕我國總領事蔣家棟與比總領事，於今晨自高隆東南部約一百公里之塒錫克馬拉甲之空中旅行嚴來，據稱，該地四週情勢有欠安謐。印尼軍於佔領該地數小時中，曾焚燒房屋二所，彼等於歸途中曾降落萬隆，並自該地搭車前往其南四十公里之芝威狄與本加速岸二地。</p>
<h3>日本議會今日復會　片山將面臨難關　反對黨企圖攫奪政權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕片山領導下之社會民主黨內閣，在日本議會令日重開時，將遭逢日本政客所視爲其成立以來之最嚴重試騐。議會重開後，其議程上仍多未處決而爭執甚烈之問題，使孤軍作戰之反對黨，自由黨，有機會圖謀推翻片山內閣。自由黨總裁前首相吉田，最近在北海道演說，指現聯合內閣，爲「一羣沐猴而冠之混合家族」。</p>
<p>片山及西尾昨日招待國內外新聞記者時，並力言現內閣在未來和會中，有充分代表日本之資格，因此無須有任何內閣之更迭。據英文日本時報十四日預測：「片山內閣由於非政府黨之强烈反對，企圖控制重要立法，在未來之議會開會期內，將遭遇重大難關」。所有此項立法，皆集中於日本經濟復興案，其中包括煤礦國營案·預算補助案·分散工商企業集中反對獨佔案等。在目前衆議員四百六十六席中，擁護片山內閣之重心，為社會民主黨及民主黨佔二百七十席以上，而反對黨自由黨則佔一百廿三席。最近一再盛傳，吉田及其他人士，企圖組織另一有力之保守的反對黨，以便奠定推翻片山之基礎，而重組有力統一之內閣，更具有充分資格能在和會中代表日本。</p>
<h3>白部長在四中全會　軍事報告哈文（上文接）（第二版）</h3>
<p>（三）半年來作戰成果：（子）戰二略上之成果：（一）匪原擬抄襲國軍抗戰戰略，欲以持久疲憊取勝，國軍早已洞燭其奸，經一再進剿，半年來匪一失於、延安，再失於魯中，割據區域日促，尤其兵員枯竭，資源不繼，隨軍事上之失利，被困於貧擠之山地，軍需生產自難供應大軍消耗，人力補充決難償其長期損失，所謂持久戰之客觀條件已告消滅。（二）匪根據地一再被毀，精銳多已喪失，軍心日見離散，匪陳毅素稱强悍，而齊魯士卒亦以驍勇者稱，其經營沂蒙山區，達十年之久，根深蒂固，迄國軍進剿，先攻佔臨沂，編克覆南麻，臨朐，其根據地蓋被摧毀，投誠來歸者日衆，匪素以唯物論爲敎義，其軍事思想亦爲唯物的，今受此事實上之打擊，其持久戰之精神條件，更已喪失。（三）匪外源斷絕，自中原軍區迅速收復，匪之補給已困難日增，唯仰賴遼東半島爲關內之唯一補給通路，其軍品補給常資於是，今我收復山東，正進擊膠東，擬遮斷其外援一綫路後，補給來源即告斷絕，亦爲匪最後末路已臨之明徵。（四）延安爲匪之政治中心，爲發號施令之所在地，經國軍收復後，其首腦已失，士氣因之亦顯動搖。（五）確保抗戰勝利之成果。我抗戰之目的，全在收復東北主權，共匪勾結外力，原企圖利用抗戰，坐收漁人之利，迄國軍接收，匪甚感失望，故不惜五次渡江進犯，但均爲我軍擊潰，而最近四平一役，尤受嚴重打擊，對於東北主權之確保，不但爲全國人民所切望，亦國家生命綫所在，半年來之作戰，匪集中全力，且勾結韓蒙匪類，仍莫可如何，亦爲我戰略上收獲之一。（丑）克復城鎭及交通綫，與俘獲傷亡共匪數量：以上所述，爲匪方戰略上之損失，亦即其精神上無法彌補之缺陷，茲將其物質上之損失，略舉其大端如次（一）收復城邑一一七個，約計面積二二八·七七八方公里。（二）斃傷匪九五〇·八九三人，俘獲九二·三三六人，投誠匪五二·五〇四人。（三）克復主要交通綫，隴海中段，北寗綫，平漢北段，平綏綫，膠濟綫，中長綫及其支綫，與錦熱綫，其中共匪破壞三·一六四公里，現搶修完成一·八二六公里，大部已通車。（四）半年來國軍剿匪進展之形勢，茲加比較，如附圖所示。（寅）以上所述，爲匪軍損失情形，至半年來國軍傷亡。爲三四六·五三七人，在山東戰塲損失較大。</p>
<p>戊　結論</p>
<p>本部卅六年度施政方針，原以繼續整軍復員爲最大目的，並按計劃逐步實施中。今共匪更加緊擴軍擴大叛亂，且進而在東北引韓蒙共匪及日俘，由某方接濟武器，攻學國軍，復竄引外蒙，公然切略西陲，半壁江山橫受摧毀，匪踪所至，隨在破壞工廠，鐵路，河堤，礦區，欲將國家元氣國民經濟完全摧毀，屠戮無辜，無所不用其極，凡異國敵人所不忍爲之殘忍行爲，共能皆甘心爲之，而無所顧惜，致人民水深火熱，國祚動搖。政府以職責所在，爲保全國脈民命，不得已乃決心戡亂，掃除建國障碍，蓋共匪存在一日，國家安寗，社會秩序，人民生活，即一日受其危害，國家財政，國民經濟，莫不受其摧殘，建國建軍，皆無從着手。綜觀世界大勢，各國間因界域觀念，經濟利害，與觀念形態之衝突，日趨尖銳，良非空言可以保障和平，吾人鑒於八年抗戰捐失之嚴重，犧牲之慘烈，對今後之國防，實應有更深之認識，與更充分之準備，方能保我國家之獨立自由與安全，而建國建軍之大業，必須統一之局，與相當時間之凖備及實施，始克完成，共匪一日不滅，國家不但不能統一，且將直換招致外禍，建國建軍即不能實行，故建國建軍，必先消滅共匪，否即國家前途，民族命運，實不堪設想，是誠目下國家解除危難，而趨於富强之首要國是矣。（完）</p>

<h3>調整稅收　解決房荒　建築改良物　將普查估價　年內先辦理舊法租界區</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市中區黃浦。閘北·滬南。法華等四個區域土地總登記及土地估價，業經次第舉辦。惟建築改良物（房屋）估價登記，因格於時間及人力物力之限制，未能同時辦理。前工部局對於舊公共租界區域內房屋雖曾調查一部份，但現有資料多屬殘缺不全。市財政局對舊法租界區域曾一度計劃調查，亦未實現。故於調整稅收及解決房荒均乏確實之依據，影響市政建設至大。市地政局爲此擬就以上各個區域內建築改良物舉辦普遍之調查與估價，以資明瞭建築改良物狀況便用情形及其現値，以爲調整稅收及解決房荒之依據。又因過去地籍與戶籍編制未能取得聯繫，對於一般行政設施至感不便，亦擬於此次調查之時注意戶地之編號以便查對，是項工作期於一年內完成。並於本年內先行辦理舊法租界區域，將來再行推及其地各區。</p>

<h3>尋仇洩恨　舞女毀容　亂洒鏹酸老正興呻吟一片　前嫌未釋金麗那再度遭殃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大滬舞廳舞女金麗娜（原名杜菊英見岡，）年廿四，常州人，曾於今春三月間，識一舞客名陸亭芳者，年三十一，日久生情，終於同居龍宮飯店。惟陸無正當職業，陸續將女私蓄騙用殆盡，女以以處境困難，協議離婚，時爲本年六月間事，當時並由女方一次貼男方四百三十萬元，言明從此兩不往來。</p>
<p>仳離後，女重入大滬，再度下海，而陸仍時往糾纏，七月十二日會乘金夜舞歸家之際，在金陵路中央公寓內，圖以鏹水傷害，但未達到目的，陸本人則反因受傷被捕。自此陸益懷恨。昨晚七時許，陸偵悉金偕另一舞女吳蘭芳及舞客四人，在三馬路大上海老正興館晚膳，於是復懷鏹水一瓶趕往，時金正與舞客談笑，被用鏹水滿洒面上，當時在塲之舞客起而阻截，因此亦爲鏹水濺及，而陸亭芳則因心慌手亂，本人之頭部及手部亦受創傷。</p>
<p>旋凶手卒爲在塲各舞客所執，時呻吟之聲遍及二樓，蓋當混亂之際，除金麗女娜面部受有重傷外，、另一舞女吳蘭芳及舞客張楨沅·陳建綱·王永福·王一鳴·暨堂倌祝春海，均受灼傷，或在面部或在手部。事後經老正興小主報警，先將傷者送仁濟醫院，除金因傷勢較重住院外，其餘各人經包紥後，即至老閘警局作證。凶手則已由警局拘押偵訊中。</p>

<h3>李熙疳播講　今日之上海敎育　文化建設為民族精神表現　希望敎育經費能酌予提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假座元昌鶴鳴電台，舉辦第二十四炙星期日時別廣播，請敎育局代理局長李熙謀播講「今日之上海敎育」，茲紀錄其演辭大意於後：</p>
<p>本市的敎育。於淪陷期間，經敵僞破壞相當嚴重，勝利之初，所做者爲復員工作，不但在物質方面須補救過去的缺陷，即在精神上亦須有新的建樹。去年一年，維開始步入整理階段。以言今日之上海敎育，可分三種：（一）中等敎育，（二）國民敎育，（三）社會敎育。中等敎育方面，尚有較中等敎育較高者，爲專科學校，市立專科學校現有三校，A，工業專科學校，內分土本，機械，電機三科，B，師範專科學校，以養成小學與初中的師資，C，體育專科學校。</p>
<p>籌設立產專科學校</p>
<p>除此以外，市政當局正籌備創辦水產專科學校，因上海封於水產漁業方面有優越的條件，有行總漁業管理處，上海漁市塲，農林部中華水產公司，人才集中，舉辦甚便，業由敎育局向敎育部呈請設立。中等學校市立者有十六校，私立者有二六七校。以學生人數而論，則市立佔三分之一，私立佔三分之二，蓋市立學校數量雖少而規模較大，私立學校數量雖多，而校舍較小，容納學生較少。國民學校，市立者有二百六十餘校，私立者有九百餘校，學生人數市立學校約十一萬人，私立學校約二十五萬人，亦爲一與二之比。從以上情形看來，私立中等學校與國民學校對上海市的敎育已盡了相當責任，如無此多量之私立學校存在，則失學問題必更嚴重。</p>
<p>社會敎育首重識字</p>
<p>至就辦學校困難而論，經費不充足，教師待遇太低，不及工商界職工，設備不够，一切物理化學實騐儀器，均付闕如，或雖有少數如格致，育才學校設備較佳，然儀器皆爲舊物，亦需補充添置。至於社會敎育，重要者爲識字問題，敎育局曾舉辦民衆學校一百二十餘所，自每校三班至五六班均有，惟感覺一點困難，即初開學時人數甚多，此後即逐漸减少，蓋來民衆學校讀書者，多爲成人，日間須工作謀生，時間稍長，則感覺厭倦。如何始能提高彼等之興趣，俾使貫澈始終，實爲民衆敎育迫切的課題。</p>
<p>經費問題最大困難</p>
<p>至於民敎館，圖書館，博物館，美術館等，為一大都市必有的文化建設。上海為中國最大的都市，外國人來中國，第一步先踏進上海，如僅看到高樓大廈，而看不到民族文化藝術，豈非上海人之羞恥，故市政當局擬於數年以內致力於上海文化建設工作。惟中國當前之最大困難問題，爲經濟問題，本市敎育費佔全市預算百分之二十，數字不爲不多，惟當此物價高漲之時，仍感不數，希望將來憲法實施後，敎育費能酌予提高，文化建設工作爲民族精神的表現，市敎育局對此必全力以赴，俾使上海不僅成爲全國經濟工商的中心，抑且成爲全國文化敎育的中心。</p>

<h3>改良棉種成績　太倉區最優良　棉株高可及人　棉鈴結實纍纍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕農林部棉產改進處，昨日招待本市各界，赴上海附近各縣，參觀該處所辦推廣美棉工作。到中國紡建公司總理束雲章，副總經理吳味經，美大使館農業參賀道格，各大紗廠代表，及各報社記者等卅餘人。淸晨九時許，則該處處長胡竟良棓同乘車出發，當以時間所限，就主要推廣各區江灣·大場·眞如·太倉四地，參觀一過。農林部長左舜生，昨晨自京抵滬，亦趨專車赴太倉參加視察。</p>
<p>棉產改進處本年在上海附近推廣區域，計有奉賢，南匪，川沙，太倉，寳山，上海市，常熟，嘉定，崑山，江陰，上海縣，及松江等十二縣市。其中以上海市，太倉，嘉定，寳山，奉賢，南匯，五縣，推廣面積最大。全區推廣面積，共達六萬四千九百九十一畝四。</p>
<p>推廣美棉品種，計有德字棉五三一號，珂字棉百號第一系，及岱字棉等三種。蓋上海及太倉一帶，農家向種中棉，纎維粗短，祗能紡十二支以下之粗紗，且產量低下，每畝棉田籽棉產量，不過百斤。美種多棉鈴肥大，長絨豐當。本區生長最佳之棉塲，每畝籽花收量，估計可達二百市斤。衣分估計自百分之卅二至四十不等。</p>
<p>登記棉田　貸發種籽</p>
<p>據棉產改進處報告：該處辦理推廣業務實施經過：（一）舉行棉田登記，在三月底前趕辦完竣。（二）貸發種籽，棉農每植棉一畝，貸給種籽八斤，是項工作於四月底全部完成。（三）指導播種間苗及定苗，四月底開始陸續播種，王月底完成間苗階段以上之工作，六月初進行定苗工作。（四）指導中耕除草，五月間進行第一次工作，六七月又行第二，三，四次工作。（五）設置棉種管理區，積極管理棉種，凡推廣棉田在五百畝以上者，均須設置棉種管理區，保持純種，爲明年推廣之用。（六）防治病虫害，本年在棉花幼苗期間，有少數蚜虫發生，入秋以後，又有捲葉虫發生，分別用藥械全力撲減。</p>
<p>農民銀行　舉辦貸款</p>
<p>該處爲解決棉農植棉時所需之各項生產費用起見，特商由中國農民銀行舉辦生產及實物貸款。凡植棉一畝，貸款一萬五千元，由各區合作社農會或協進會等棉農組織洽領。關於實物貸款一項，計有豆餅，銷酸銨，及磷酸鈣三種。貸款總額，共計約二十億元。</p>
<p>昨日參觀各區經過，六倉區以屬示範性質，故所植改良棉種，成績特優。棉株高可及人，蓋以各株種植距離適度，每株所結棉鈴，尤屬纍纍可觀，與同植一旁之中棉相較，軒輊立判。第六區棉紡公會特在眞如設立棉作育種塲，有二行試騐，五行試騐，十行試騐，暨繁殖區德字棉等，成績亦屬不弱。據調查，本年上海各縣市第一次棉產數字，美棉皮棉總產量，約佔二萬市担以上。</p>

<p>上午九時，招待委員李代局長。朱君惕處長·陳　琴·黃任堅·胡叔異·舒新城·盧冠六等廿餘人，絡繹齊集南市露香園萬竹小學，在寬闊的操塲西端大敎室中，欣賞兒童勞作美術成績。四壁縣滿小學生盡的水彩畫，木炭盡，彫刻，刺繡等，珠瑯滿目，桌上擺着農具，傢俱，紡織機，交通工具，從原「始」時代的木犁，條櫈，手搖紡車，獨輪車，帆船等，直到「原子」時代的打禾機，沙發，錠子鐵紡車，火車，汽船和飛機等，顯示科學的日新，文化的月異。室中最引人注目的，是理想中的浦江大鐵橋立體模型，橋上車輛塞路，江面舟艇交集，實在符合理想。計劃建造越江大橋圖爲設計中之模型</p>

<p>日子一天天的過去，「讀奢助學金」的特別勸募限期，也一天天的迫近起來，總計捐款的成績，離開預期的目標，還有上那麽遙遠的一段距離，爲了無數淸寒學生的學業，爲了無數有爲靑年的前途，我們聲嘶力竭的吶喊，呼籲，但是這殘酷的社會，並沒有寄予我們多大的同情與援助，無數莘莘學子，還是在那裏殷切的盼望着援助和救濟。</p>
<p>給予一個正在遭受着困厄的人的援助，也許比對於一個正處於幸福快樂的環境中的人的頌讀更富有眞實的意義吧！那麽，親愛的讀者，爲什麽你們不對這般淸寒的靑年多賦與一點實惠，多給予一點援助呢？</p>
<p>「讀者助學金」將在本月廿二日截止收款，短促的七天光陰，將似流星般的逝去，我們希望親愛的讀者，能够在七天的時期內給需要援助的人以緊急的援助。</p>
<p>昨天我們收到讀者饒鐘陽君宴客節約捐款二百萬元，其他如五福廣告公司諸同人都爲我們出了很大的力，謹在此一件致謝。</p>

<h3>湘糧解禁　惡果不堪設想</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙十日航訊〕湖南是全國的「糧庫」，「糧庫」裏却偏偏在收藏的時候發生了糧價暴漲的現象。且因漲勢在迅速發展，已把市塲搞得一片混亂，已把人心弄得岌岌不安了。升斗的小民不會忘記：一個多月以前，上熟米最高價只賣十萬元左右一担；而在濱湖新穀已完全登塲，別地也在「大割」的最近一個月中，却反而跳漲到十八萬開外一担了。升斗的食民也很淸楚這暴漲的內幕：不是歉收，不是來源缺乏；只是政府不該「開禁」，不該讓京滬漢及廣東的米商到湖南來，把黃亮亮的維繫着湖南三千萬人口的糧食搬出去。</p>
<p>糧價暴漲</p>
<p>是從七月十六日省府委員會議中通過「糧食開禁」的議案以後而開始的。這個議案的通過，是事先徵得省參議會的同意，並採納了省敎育會的如此建議：運出省境銷售的糧食，每一担穀，征收敎育捐獻五千元，以協助敎育復員。省府這種措置，是很「民主」的。至於通過這議案的理由，則是:以目前（七月中旬）各綫運輸力量而言，每月運出省境糧食，最多不致超過五十萬担（指穀而言），以今年尚有五個月之時間論，總數爲二百五十萬担。再就本省餘糧作比例：平常年之收成，正糧爲數約一億二千餘萬担，雜糧爲二千八百餘萬担；本省實際所需糧食爲一億一千五百餘萬祖，則尚有餘糧三千餘萬担；但今年是豐收年，據估計正糧約可達一億五千餘萬祖，是則餘糧較平常年可多出三千餘萬担。本省糧食旣旣無虞匱乏，「糧荒」之象，決不致發生，因之糧食亦不可能成爲被操縱或投機的對象。</p>
<p>在這稱「正確的估計」之下，湘糧便很輕巧地「解禁」了！</p>
<p>七月二十一日於長沙市成立「穀米外運登記處」，辦理登記及繳　捐獻事定；並於長沙，靖港，湘險，蘆林潭，岳陽之城陵磯，華容之注磁口，梅田湖，點角鬚，南縣之三仙湖，安鄉之梅景窰，絲圻東南之黃沙河，宜章之白陵等處爲稽查地點。</p>
<p>第二天省府舉行會議，便通過了撥連粤米五萬祖的提案。</p>
<p>從此以後，湖南的米糧市塲上，就漸漸展開了反常的現象：本省的米商拚命往外運，外省的米商則源源深入濱湖產區採購，尤其是近半月來經登記手續出運的糧食每日平均約兩萬五千担，而偷運的還不知有多少。截至八月廿九日止，所征敎育捐獻已達三十三億餘元，以此數字推算，在七月二十一日到八月廿九日這四十天中，運出的糧食即達七十餘萬祖。這與官方原來的估計，便超出了三分之一强。因此，穀價就騰漲無已！</p>
<p>濱湖每年產穀約一千六百萬担左右，而本地所需之穀約一千三百餘萬担；以目前的情形觀之，餘糧實不足三個月的搬運。濱湖歉收，固然足以引起全省糧食的匱乏；而濱湖的糧食售罄了，並不一定就能够滿足米商們的利慾；所以湘江的兩岸與資，濃的肥沃田野上，是隨時有被米蟲們蛀食的危險。</p>
<p>同時爲了配合戡亂，一百萬担軍糧，亦限九月底，繳足半數，省府刻已派大員前往濱湖十一縣分區督征。三湘的人民都是刧後餘生，他們受盡了戰禍和天災，他們更不會忘懷觀音土，樹皮，草根的滋味；所以他們都預測到；糧食源源外運，今後會演出怎樣不幸的結果來。</p>
<p>長沙是湖南的神經中樞，所以糧價的暴漲對於市民生活情緒的刺激也特別敏感：於九月三日向市府請願，要求評價。市府則因爲已有好幾次「評價反而漲價」的經騐，何况最近在全省正在瘋狂出運，更無從「評」起；所以以兩句話把責任推向省府，說道：只要省府恢復禁令，事情那就好辦，現在，就省府新趨勢看來，米糧外運禁令之恢復，當亦不遠的了。（李育仁）</p>

<h3>中國的基本敎育　基敎會我代表團建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕在我首都舉行之遠東區基本敎育硏究會議，自本月三日至十二日，開會凡十日，我中國代表團關於「中國的基本敎育」有所建議，特於會後書面發表是項建議如次：（一）我國基本敎育之目標，除依照現行法規之規定切實推行外，應特別重視個人生活之改善，社會經濟之提高，及國際了解之增進，以實現民生康樂與世界大同之理想。（二）我國基本敎育之推行，必須成人補習敎育與兒童敎育如兩翼之並舉並進，勿有所僱重與僱廢。（三）我國基本敎育之實騐計劃，應配合國內政治，經濟，社會，與文化實况，及世界敎育思潮之趨勢，而有所抉擇。（四）基本敎育旣以改進受敎者整個生活爲對象，農工各業均應爲重要因素。欲求其有效推行，決非敎育行政機關所能單獨完成其任務。故政附應有全盤計劃，聯合衛生，社會，農林，永利，經濟，內政各部，及有關機關，通力合作，配合推進，以收分工合作之效。（五）基本敎育以由地方舉辦爲原則，但中央亦應有技術上之有力輔導，及經濟上充分補助。</p>
<p>普及基敎期不超過十年</p>
<p>（六）中央對於基本敎育，應重訂分年普及切實可行之具體計劃。學齡兒童之義務敎育，應增加年限，延至六年（邊疆地區得暫定四年），成人補習敎育應充實內容，增加效率。而普及基本敎育時期，則從今以後，至長不得超過十年。（七）著名各國全國敎育經費中，基本敎育經費均佔絕大多數。目前我國全國敎育經費用之於基本敎育者，僅佔百分之三十，此實爲基本敎育不易發展之主因。今後中央應將全部敎育經費至少百分之十五辦理並補助基本敎育，並應指定稅收，爲地方基本敎育開闢經費之來源。必要時並得經地方民意機關之同意，徵收基本敎育稅專款保管。（八）師資訓練機關，除由政府大量設置，以培養足敷之師資外，並得由私人設立，以應需要，但仍須依照師範敎育之方針及訓練計劃之規定。（九）基本敎育工作人員，應有合理的任用及保障，其待遇必須提高。除底薪必須充分增加外，生活津貼應照公務人員標准支給，並實行年功加俸，養老撫卹，及學術進條等制度。（十）縣市敎育局應迅速普徧恢復，使之　金，並提高其職權，改善其待遇，以期敎育行政專業化，而能增進行政效率。</p>
<p>現行敎科書兼採審定制</p>
<p>（十一）基本敎育之課種，應再求切實合用，並留申縮之餘地，以適應地方需要。現行敎科書應廣羅各方面之專家，商討，編輯，力求改善，並採用審定制度，以便公開競爭，期能獲得善本。兒童及民衆讀物，應充分編輯，並力求改善，以期普徧，並特久供應。新而有效之方法與工具，則應盡量介紹鼓勵，盡力硏究試騐，期其不斷改進。（十二）推行語文敎育，應利用國音字母，厲行國語敎學，規定字彙及詞彙，並使文字之繁複者趨於簡化，以增加敎育之效率。（十三）爲該推行基本敎育之示範，應依照第三條之原則，聯合有關機關及敎育學術團體，選定若干實騐區，集中人力財力，研究改進敎育與生活之切實有效方法，以資倡導。並鼓勵協助各地方，對於此項示範設計，逐漸推廣。（十四）獎勵私人興學，並鼓勵敎育學術團體硏究敎育方法，以求基本敎育之質量並進。（十五）爲推行基本敎育，促使其普及起見，敎育部及地方敎育行政機關，應約集專家，確定方案，共同努力，使之迅速實現。</p>

<p>（一）台省富有工業基礎之條件，並其有近代文化經濟組織，易於發揮效率，在我國對外貿易上當有極重要地位。爲復興工商建設所需，生產器材應由日本賠償物資作有計劃之補給。不足時請全國對外貿易會議建議政府放鬆管制，准許民問輸入。組織赴日商務代表團辦法實施綱要應規定對日進出口貨物所未列入之醫藥醫療器材，捕魚器具，草帽原料、並輸出糖鹽加工品及樹薯粉（漿粉）等。（二）臺灣銀行尚未獲爲指定准營外匯之銀行，因此台省貿易障碍殊多，發展無由，請建議政府指定台銀爲准營外匯之銀行。（三）爲發展貿易提高經濟效率起見，請建議政府將公營事業盡量迅予標售，在過渡期間，將其產名劃分一部，交與民營貿易商辦理。</p>
<h3>宣司令飭屬　查禁米糧出口</h3>

<h3>民營紗廠提議組織　紗市聯合外銷機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉紡織業榮鴻元鑒於戰後紗布輸出，極受限制，紡織業前途，頗受影響，爲爭取國外市塲及維護民營紗廠之生存計，特向全貿會議提出紗布輸出方案。茲將其建議理由摘要列次：</p>
<p>爲推動我國出口貿易，爭取外匯，加强紡織工業之生產能力，擬由民營紗廠組織紗布外銷聯合機構。我國自紗布輸出限制以來，對抑平物價，收效甚微，而紗布同業，目前因惑受國際紡織品競爭之威迫，及外匯頭寸之短細，使原料不能充分準備，機械無從擴充，產量無以增加，在上述新環境重重包圍下，今後我國如不積極樹立海外紗布市塲，則紡織業曰即無前途可言。國營紡建公司近爲充裕外匯資源計，正在積極推動紗布外銷，並與僑商訂立承銷合同，採取原棉輸入成品輸出之原則，擴充海外市塲。其進一步之計劃，聞擬在香港甩加坡，暹邏，馬尼剌等地設置倉庫，以供當地需要。由此以觀，國營紗布出口，已有獨占鰲頭之勢，民營紗布，若不乘此時機，同時開放出口，實不足以言今後棉紡織工業對外全面發展貿易之可能。關於此一問題，全國經委會所通過之經濟改革方案中，早經規定紗布出口，國營方面，由紡建提供生產量百分之二十，民營提供百分之十至二十。我民營紡織業爲自求生存計，亟宜把握時機，從述推動紗布輸出。此項紗布輸出，爲避免國際侵軋，及防止自相競爭，與外商取巧抑價之損害，擬請大會提出愼重討論，轉請政府加以扶植。由民營紗廠聯合組織紗布外銷機構，統一輸出，爭取外匯，訂購外棉，統配於各民營紗廠，藉以增加產量。則抑平物價，亦可收效，而紗廠機械設備技術改進，均可逐步臻）於完善之步驟。</p>
<h3>大批黃金由菲運澳　價値二百萬美元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十三日電〕據晚報載稱，黃金一批，價値二百萬美元，計重四三七六〇兩，已於十二日由水陸兩用飛機運往澳門。菲律濱政府前因國際貨幣基金團之請，於七月間禁止黃金出口，近以金子商人之壓力，財政部不得不修改禁令，使此一批由墨西哥經馬尼剌轉運之黃金，得以抵達目的地。</p>
<p>又訊，羅哈斯總統十二“下令寬放黃金轉運出口禁令，准許在本年七月十九日以前領有執照之人，遝出其確實在菲律濱之黃金。按該一日期即電界貨幣基金團要求各會員國禁止黃金遝往非會員之日。財政部稱，轉出口執照持有人倘不能證明其所欲輸出之黃金確實在菲島，則將吊銷其執照。同時亞多金礦公司已首先恢復開採，碧瑤附近之大楔礦，八月份採得價値二〇三二六九美元之黃金。民大拿金礦公司本月份起開採，所出金塊一兩月內可在舊金子交易所上市。但礦業界人士稱，金價倘不自目前之每兩三十五美元提高，則菲島黃金出口，難達戰前標準。</p>
<p>美國黃金產量增加</p>
<p>〔聯合計華盛頓十三日電〕礦務局今日宣佈，七月份美國黃金出土，速率之大，爲一九四二年以來所未有。產額凈計一九七一四八盎斯，較諸六月份增加三萬盎斯，較去年同月增加百分之十九。主要原因厥在阿拉斯加本季恢復大規模出產之故。</p>
<h3>工商輔導處　分組調查工廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工商輔導處對工廠調查事，現正積極進行。該處請得專款一筆，僱用臨時調查員三十餘人，自本月六日起，分組調查各工廠。調查員之學歷，均爲大學畢業或職校畢業而有服務經騐者。另有特約調查員一百人，則爲省立上海中學學生，協助一切。預定調查之廠家近萬，調查之對　爲（一）工廠人事之一般情形，（二）設備情形，（三）原料與產品，（四）動力情形，（五）技工情形等。預定三個月內完成全部工作，本年全國各地之工商輔導處均展開所在地之工廠調查工作，明年度調查之範圍將擴大。</p>
<h3>食油市塲　今日開市</h3>
<p>食油市塲上週六停市一天，定今晨開市。如中信局對食油拋售新辦法，今晨未能經央行張總裁核准，則今明兩日或將暫停拋售，而由各大廠商將存油配撥。社會局主管處正進行修訂食油市塲交易規章，得主管當局審核後施行。今日將由警局派員監塲，對違反塲規者，槪予取締云。</p>
<h3>中紡估値完竣</h3>
<p>按二十六年物價　約値一億元左右</p>
<p>中國紡建公司資產估値工作，業已復查完竣。據悉全部資產總値，按二十六年物價，約値一億元左右。此一數字，包括天津靑島之資產在內，惟東北並未列入。聞估價委員會將鄭重考慮全部佔値乘以一適當之倍數，再行呈報政院核定，即可辦理出售手續云。</p>
<h3>中國銀行將在　暹京設立分行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕外交界息；中國銀行擬在暹京曼谷開設分行，暹方前曾拒不同意，經我駐暹大使館向暹政府積極交涉，茲悉暹國會探於九月四日通過議案，允許中行開設分行。今後暹僑匯問題當可得到合理解決。</p>
<h3>柏油秋銷發動　價較上年漲四十倍</h3>
<p>浙省柏油，本市銷量雖不及湖北所產之廣，但其地位亦頗佔重要，出品有「禾本坪油蘭油」三種，以「禾本」爲標準，市面漲跌都以禾本爲主。坪油蘭油目下現貨斷檔，且含水份，故不若湖北之「麻城·尖麻·拆雪·荆柏」等油之吃香。現浙油靑黃不接，存貨枯薄。湖北油產地價昻，且運輸阻梗。近日燭淘作廠秋銷發動，需求殷切。昨日「禾本」油每市担已漂至二百萬元，比之上年同日，上升達四十倍之鉅。</p>
<h3>紡織業要求增加　國代及立委名額</h3>
<p>（本報訊〕全國紗廠聯合會爲請求增加紡織業國大及立委名額，曾於五日在滬召開第廿三次理監事聯席會議，決定推派吳味經注竹一劉丕基三人代表晋京。請求增加紡織業國大代表至四人立法委員二人。吳氏等一行，業於日前返滬。據談：此次晋京會分向立法院及社會部　請願，提出請求三點：（一）增加名額。（二）對重要工業，應予合理分配。（三）紗廠業所佔之名額，應予確定。聞立法院對增加名額一點，表示僅須國務會議通過後，即可交立法院完成立法程序，社會部對各點請求，原則亦表同意云。</p>

<h3>文藝復興的前驅者　但丁逝世紀念</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>——為歐洲文藝復興節日作</p>
<p>歐洲中古黑暗時代進入近世時代，中間經過一度思想上的蛻變，那便是文藝復興運動（Renaisance）。這運動是宗敎上的革新，文化上的復古與再生，但也是反抗神權，敎皇，禁慾主義；建立重理知，尚自然，尊個性，尚自由的「現世思想」的運動。</p>
<p>據一般文藝史家的分劃，文藝復興概分三期：</p>
<p>第一期爲自然發達時期</p>
<p>第二期爲擬古時期</p>
<p>第三期爲異宗美術時期</p>
<p>在第一期裏有三大人物爲其代表，即但丁，彼脫拉，和樸加斯。而其中但丁（Dante　Alighieri）雖爲中世紀詩人，實在是近世思想的開山祖，文藝復興的前驅者！</p>
<p>說起但丁，他是個身材高大的人，常穿灰色長袍，頭戴紅冠，環以桂呀，他雖有一副憂鬱的鷹嘴臉，却是世界上最奇異而美麗的戀愛故事中的英雄。一二六五年他生於弗洛侖斯，九歲時遇女郞比特麗斯（Beatrice）未交一言，便一見鍾情，認爲是他的靈魂的第一快樂。十八歲時，又遇見那女郞一次，兩次仍是默默無言。後來比特麗斯出嫁了，卅五歲便香消玉殞，但丁得了她的死訊，還寫道：</p>
<p>『當我失去我「靈魂的第一快樂」時，我爲憂愁所刺，竟乃沒有東西可以安慰我。」</p>
<p>後來，這戀愛故事在但丁的著作：「新生」中曾叙述出來。</p>
<p>但丁生平最大的著作是「神曲」（The　Divine　Comedy）它裏面包孕所有加特力敎的最美麗最奇異的東西。在它裏面可見到中世紀的哲學，神學，及武士道的菁粹。結構宏偉，意想高超，人物奇異而複維，想像豐富，讀文雋永！有人說，拉丁人中足與莎士比亞抗衡者惟但丁一人。近古時代，有足與荷馬頡頏者亦惟但丁一人！</p>
<p>但丁卅一歲娶妻，中年因政治活動而遭放逐，流浪終其生。死後遺囑：「誓不以屍骨返故鄉。」他死時是一三二一年的九月十四日。</p>
<p>在被逐出弗洛侖斯以後，他遊歷各地，在此期中完成了偉大著作「神曲」。所以他自己的生活，常散布叙述於「神曲」的超自然的事實中。包括他自己的悲哀動人的戀愛故事；政爭，及與他有關的政事。</p>
<p>「神曲」是一部描寫「天堂」，「地獄」，及「凈士」（Purgatory）的書，在文字表面上說來，是死後靈魂情形的一種幻想。在寓意方面說來，牠是指示人之需要精神的光照與指導的。</p>
<p>「地獄」的形狀是一個無涯大的陷阱，如一個倒立的圓椎體，他的頂點是在中心。這地獄有十層，罪惡最大的人就在最下層。層層有種種怪異的描述，寫來彷彿是如生的眞實。</p>
<p>「凈土」，在但丁想像中，是在露天之下的。環繞於凈土的山的四周陡坡的，有七個圈層，每一層與中世紀敎會所認爲七個死罪之一相應。在較下一層是蹟靈魂之罪的，它遊完了最後一層「凈土」，便進了「地上的天堂」（Earthly　Paradise）看見了比特魔斯坐在車上，周圍有百多個小天使圍着他唱歌，散佈花朶。「天堂」，這裏是「神曲」中的最光榮的所在，但丁遊過「九天」，一些固定而不動的一天」！在八種「天」之上的第九天，是「晶天」，他的運動，可指導諸「天」每日行動，自然界，時與動皆發源於此；所有世界上所受的神的影響也皆發動於此。在此天之上，那幻像的頂點，乃是無限無動的神聖的「愛之海」</p>
<p>這樣豐富想像的絕著，正是但丁廿年中流浪，窮愁中的產物，所以他的「神曲」開卷便說：</p>
<p>「當吾生之中途，予乃迷路而陷於幽林」！</p>
<p>總之，「神曲」代表了但丁思想之總匯，它是用意大利「俗文」寫成，而不是用古文寫的。雖以中古爲骨幹，却是以近世爲其精神與容貌的。所以說，但丁及其偉著「神曲」是文藝復興的開山祖，前驅者！</p>
<p>編者按：但丁，道一位六百二十六年前的文壇巨匠，他的可紀念之處，不祗是他有一段美麗動人的戀愛故事，也不祗是他有一部不朽巨著—神曲，更不祗是他參加過政治運動；正如中世紀的註釋家都不以他爲一位大詩人，而當他是一位有智能的預言家一樣。我們更應該認識的是這位詩人的哲學和思想及其影響；他是中世紀到文藝復興的橋樑。所以一般歷史學者就以他的逝世之年（一三二一年）劃分中古時代與近古時代，這確是很有意義的。可惜的我國直到現在還沒有一部完善的「神曲」的譯本可備介紹。</p>

<h3>北海畫展與成竹畫展</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>在九一八紀念日，上海將有兩個畫展出現；</p>
<p>一是在中國藝苑舉行的朱應鵬先生畫展，一是在靑年會舉行的凌成竹女士畫展</p>
<p>這兩個畫展雖同時樂行，但畫風却絕不相同，適可成爲一有趣的對照，在沒有看他和她兩位的作品以前，要是憑一般的理想去推斷二位的作風，以為男士的畫，總是大氣旁礴，女士的畫總是豐姿詔秀，但是這二位的畫却適得其反，男士的畫是豐姿韶秀，而女士的畫反大氣旁礴，男士的畫却有幾分女性，女士的畫却有幾分男性。</p>
<p>應鵬先生，別署北海，海上藝壇老將之一，早年本習國畫，繼攻西　　二十餘年，九一八後始再專硏國畫，其人本慷慨豪爽，不可一世，而所作之畫，乃細針密縝，小巧玲瓏，毫無縱橫習氣，其淵然之光，澹然之色，一種靜穆文雅的趣味，能使觀者躁釋矜平，俗腸盡去，「百鍊鋼化爲繞指柔」「絢爛之極，歸於平淡」，畫境之高，誠堪欽佩，所畫並不題款，更不題詩，題字於裝池後的詩堂上，尤得唐宋人的遺意。其女公子明王女士專攻唐人舞女，此次亦附展三十輻，均極工妙。</p>
<p>成竹女士，北平望族，幼從蕭謙中蕭屋泉湯定之陳半丁王夢白諸先生習畫，出筆豪放，近擷白石缶老的精華，遠挹石濤八大的神釆更參以白陽天池的風趣，所作毫無巾幗氣。遍遊南北各省，所至有聲。上海女畫家雖多，作寫意草卉，能傳缶老一派者則少，色墨淋漓，筆快風雨，能令觀者神王興飛，而其人因溫文爾雅，彬彬有禮，不愧爲北平的典型女性。</p>
<p>有人說：「畫如其人」，看了二位的畫，這句話恐怕不大適用了。</p>
<p>頑貓阿咪（廿七）　張樂平作</p>
<h3>荷花　（百年畫展出品之一）</h3>
<p>任預字立凡，蕭山人，秉承其父渭長家學，花烏絕類其父，山水則別闌蹊徑。惟性疎瀨，落拓海上，每於窘迫時，有以金進者，立爲作畫，否則不應。是幀係幕白陽山人晚年之作，用筆飄逸，造次而成，平淡中有深趣，墨色着潤雅潔，極似白腸。（陳倚石識）</p>
<h3>觀戴啟人國畫預展有感</h3>
<p>— 劉叔游</p>
<p>上海爲一個人才薈萃的所在，無奇不有，無所不包，有人喩之爲「東方巴黎」，的確是不錯的。上海舉行的畫展，也特別的較其他的都市爲多，這種形形色色的展覽會，有投機商人冒名頂替爲生意眼的展覽會，有的依仗着政治地位關係在「打秋風」，也有以眞正的按術修養的成績在展覽者，但是前兩者却較佔着多數，這個很可以看得出社會文化的墮落，以及社會經濟的不景氣。戴君啓人的畫展，昨在新生活俱樂部舉行預展，今日可正式開幕，公開展覽二天，上海的人士可以看看這位後方剛來的畫家的作風如何，我今天在預展中所得的印象與惑覺是這樣的：這位畫家的作風，可以說完全爲藝術而藝術，完全以藝人姿態爲藝術而創造，埋頭苦幹，其所作的花卉翖毛，至少是脫盡了市儈氣，烟火味。他畫的方法雖然是取之於古人，但沒有一處爲古人的舊法所籬範，每幅都看得出他是在創造，他是在寫生；雖在創造，寫生，但其筆筆別饒古趣，一花一木，一枝一葉，小心經營，大贍落筆，一種渾厚樸實之質，揮灑磅礴之氣，放溢紙上，潛藏墨底，如展覽作品中之芍藥，牡丹，秋葵，紅梅等，沒有不色墨瀟灑，筆力挺健。所畫的柳鶯，羣鴿，雄鷄，鷹鷺等，都合乎自然情理，不假託虛構，飛翔　止，雀噪鶴鳴，無不栩栩欲生。所謂「應物象形，隨類傳彩。」深得古人六法。至時人每爲空中飛馬，海底游龍，是戴君所不取；或爲墨潑丹塗，粗獷火野，自以爲標新立異，大力勝人，反議社會人士鑑賞能力薄弱，不够欣賞以自豪，也爲戴君所不法；至若實妃出浴，大鬧葡萄架之類的一派色情作品，嫵媚動人，一味迎合社會墮落心理者，更爲戴君所不足道。戴君展覽中之作品，我雖不佈說：一洗浮靡之風，但至少也可爲浮誇淺薄者鑑。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸白</h3>
<p>— 葉動風</p>
<p>耀羣一出大門，略一停留，便跨到對街，在一排店面前，來去蹓躂了一回，好像要購買些什麼而又打不定主意似的；其實是在相度對面飯店的形勢，要找一個適合的地點，給小老虎留下暗記。在好幾個相宜的地位上，她看中了「中國飯店」市招左角下，一塊四五寸見方的灰白色磚而，周園都有掩蔽，却十分適合裝上一個暗記的條件。</p>
<p>這「暗記」究竟是怎麼一同事呢？因當日在老寨中常有小隊，出發到二三百里外去打游擊，這小隊幾十人，在山野裏當然可以結隊行動，有時則須經過城鎭鬧市駐足；人多，未免岔眼，所以入城之先，就把小隊折散，三三兩兩，各自尋店住宿。然又害怕失去聯絡，所以每小組駐足的地點，都有一個暗記；自己的人，一望而知。這也有些像大江南北，秘密結社的「字條」指標同一用意，用紅紙或黃紙寫着莫明其妙的字句，或「…大他降壇…」字樣，沿路斜貼牆上，個中人觀其斜度，即知會集方向，地點。</p>
<p>但老寨暗記，自經耀羣改良以後，弄得十分隱密而又簡明；外人絕對不易發現，而自己人一見之下，不僅明瞭其處有本寨同志註足，並且連等級姓名都在上面。譬如耀羣是第七隊隊長，她的暗記就是一個「七」字。留這暗記的地位，只有屋角，門框左右，市招周圍，等等，然必須這地位四面有掩蔽色調，花紋，或痕跡；以免引起外人注意。裝這暗記的工具，並不一定，有時用白堊，有時黑鉛或其他顏色品，有時則僅用小刀或錐鑽刻劃。至於等級，劃去地位正中央的，必是隊長，其餘四角，上兩角爲小隊長之類，下兩角則爲隊員。但在離去時候，必須把暗記取消。</p>
<p>這種暗記方式，在關外頗能運用自如，然却不及百忍莊的暗記，那樣複雜完備（見海屋劍客羣），連工作，方向，時問”意義，都可表現出來，而且所用鉛粉，滲有磷鐳等發光質體，雖在深夜暗陬，亦隱約可見；到了相當時間，又能自己消散泯跡。這當然比較耀羣所用的方式，效用大的多。</p>
<p>耀羣本也無須在這裏做什暗記，因爲「法租界」這一區內，根本只有幾家可住的旅舍，如大華，裕中，國民，等等。其他如舊式不備臥具的，如畏發，長春，等等七八家，當然不會住下。况見耀羣的這個「七」字也是一個明顯的指標；七，十七，二十七，（六與八亦在內），等等房間號碼，只要有個「七」，另外旅客一覽牌上又有紀小姐，豈不十分明顯？又何必要在門外弄上那個暗記？在這靑天白日，衆且昭彰之下，弄這玩意，就不說危險，恁是耀羣如何伶俐機警，可也添上許多麻煩哩。</p>
<p>然而這步手續，爲小老虎着想，却又可省而不可省。只要想到小老虎去探取的這項消息，萬一是個有時間性，或必須爭取時間的秘密動作，這四五家合條件的旅舍，又不在一條路上挨家排列着，呌他大老遠的跑來跑去，一家一舍的去尋找起來，不僅費力費事，也許還要誤了大事咧。所以耀羣在「兩害相權取其輕」的條件下，寗願自己麻煩一些。</p>

<h3>木材新製品</h3>
<p>— 唐耀</p>
<p>木材爲一種重要有機原料，在航空工程之應用上，近年來頗有驚人之成就。吾人想像中之木料，經近代新技術之加工處理，得使數種精製品之力學强度及其固定性，可比之柔鋼；由木材精製之一種注射紙（ImpregnatedPaper），其抗拉性（TensileStrength）及其輕度，已操過輕金屬之鋁。利用木屑與廢料以製工業用酒精，在美國近有年產一萬加侖以上之工廠，已經究成。型料（Plastics）之用木材爲原料以製造者，亦逐漸增多。因此，無怪美國人之視其林產硏究所爲世界最大之魔術家，或稱木材爲一種奇異之原料。筆者曾就美國幾種木材新產品如尿素型成木（Urea-Plasticized　Wood或Uralloy），抗縮木（Impreg），加壓木（Compreg），木質型料（Lignin　Plastics）及紙基型料（Papreg），加以介紹。（見海王第十七年十一期，廿期）茲擬就近三十年來，有關木材之新技術與重要發明，加以檢討，以期對於近年來有關木材之驚奇貢獻，得以窺其崖略；倘能進而促起吾人對於林產利用之近代化，此尤作者之微意也。</p>
<p>溯當本世紀之初葉，世人尚無法控制木材之乾燥。及歐戰發生，美國需要大批乾燥木材以製造飛機，美人梯門氏曾首創一種噴水式之控制爐（Water-SprayKiln），可以節制相對濕度，使木材在短期內得以乾燥而少翹曲，因得供應大量之飛機村料，爲木材人工乾燥之　矢，此其一。木材在軸向及橫向，性質頗有差異；因之機身機翼之製造，多用紋理交疊之木材薄片，加以膠黏；此項技術，當第一次歐戰時，亦頗有進展，實開人造樹脂（Synthetic　resin）硏究與製造之先河，而與近代木材之精製品，關係亦至密切，此其二</p>
<p>德國之於木材化學及應用化工之知識，以增進木織維之用途上，改進木材之材性以及在衣料‘食料之解決上，均有顯著之成就。數種之精製木材（Refined　Wood），如碚克拉特木（Badelisiertes　Holz），人造石木（Ligno　tone），金屬鑲木（Panzerhloz）及金屬化木(Metalholz）等，雖其重要性有不同；但利用科學工業之技術，以補救木材之缺點，增高其利用，誠屬難能可貴。在英國方面，亦有注射加壓層板（Impregnated　lamina　ted，Compressed　Wood），用於飛機之製造。惟木村技術上供獻最多者，實以美國林產所爲巨擘，茲撮其最重要者如下：</p>
<p>（一）阻止木村之收縮：溯當1937年上午，美國林產研究所化工專家斯丹姆（A．J．Stamn）氏，致力於木材腸體化學（Colloidal　Chemistry）上之硏究，其目的在使人造樹脂合成於木材細胞璧之微細結構內（Submicroscopic　Structure），以期木材本身，失却脹縮之能力，此木材抗縮（Anti-Shuinkage）研究上之基本原理也。</p>
<p>（二）木材質型料二美國林產硏究所研究木材質（Lignin）專家哈立士（E．E．Harris），在七八年前曾以木屑製就型料。其法使木屑木片，置蒸煮器中，先經溫和之水解（Hydrolysis）；所用蒸汽壓力，通常每方吋135－200磅更經冲洗過瀘後，磨爲粉狀，　爲型料。經試騐就75％之水解木，加入25％之酚脂（Phenol　Resin），在華氏300度之溫度每方吋3000－4000磅之壓力下壓製。近年來經技術上之改進，已可模製成巨大物件，以供工程上之應用。此種成品，有優良之抗水性抗酸性絕緣性，每方吋之抗彎强爲8000－13000磅，浸水48小時後僅吸收0.2－0.3％水分云。</p>
<p>（三）化學乾燥（Chemical　Seasoning）：美國林產所木材乾燥專家羅夫保羅氏（W．K．Loughborough），有鑒於本材當乾燥時往往外表已乾，內部尚濕。據其硏究，倘能使木材之水分，由內部先乾，漸及外表；則多種因乾燥不當所生之瑕疵，均可避免。渠將待乾燥之木板，浸於適當之化學品如食鹽內，浸入木材之四周；使之當乾燥時初期，防止外部之乾燥，兼可使內部之水分，徐徐導入表面。如是對於甚難乾燥之沼生櫟木，有顯著之改進。（未完）傷較局部（如手足面部）凍傷為易藥而嚴重，身體棄不健康（如貧血，心臟衰弱，營養不良）及嗜酒者不宜派往北極工作，因飲酒後血管擴展，內熱易於發散，體溫不易保持也。室外工作時，由於冰雪反射光綫甚强，易傷自力須時載用琥珀色眼鏡預防之。</p>
<h3>人造不凍港</h3>
<p>— 葛明</p>
<p>瑞典的兩位科學家——B·〇·潘森和E·福斯蘭特——已想出了一個辦法來，能使北方的港口也終年不凍，可以通航。他們的方法是；在港內水底浸着許多開口的管子，其中有一種液體從岸上的壓縮機和輸送管流下來。較暖的水從底下昇上去，以溶化海面上的冰或防止上層的永凝結爲冰。那些浸在水底的管子，開口處彎曲成弧形，所以放出來的熱水液會成爲波浪形，向四面八方傳佈開去，以防止大片地方的結冰。除此以外，這新發明的設計，也可用以保持水力發電站周圍和輸送木料的河流中的水不凍。</p>
<h3>電燈蟲</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>在美洲的熱帶地方，有一種長約一吋半的甲蟲。在牠的胸部兩側，有透明的團窗似的部分，像彈丸那麽大小，在這裏就是發出明亮光輝的光源。</p>
<p>牠所發的光並不如螢火虫那樣時亮時熄，差不多每次能够繼續到五分鐘以上，所以看起來就覺得牠好像是永遠地發着光而並不消滅似的。</p>
<p>那裏的土人就把這些虫放入小小的盒中，作爲電筒的代川品。就可以在黑暗中走路與電筒一般無二。</p>
<h3>北極的人類生活</h3>
<p>— 宋勵吾</p>
<p>人類活動受自然環境影響至大，氣候爲自然環境中最基本的要素，對於人生的關係極爲密切，欲天雪地的南極大陸，罕有人跡可尋，北極中心附近過去以尚無探險隊前往未盡明瞭外，北緯六十度以北之亞歐與北美大陸及冰洋中諸島嶼，早有人類定居，格林蘭島之埃斯基摩人歷史久遠，現有人數約及二萬，西伯利亞和拉伯蘭人則住於東半球大陸和島嶼上。年來北冰洋中島嶼已爲各國角逐對象，工作人員紛紛前往，美蘇等國的北極工作站設立極多，且已推進北緯八十二度地方。故北極氣候條件，如稍加以人爲之設備，並不足以限制人康而興奮，各種病原菌以及傳染病的媒介，均不易生長發育，故傷寒，痢疾，霍亂，黑熱病，瘧疾等熱帶流行病固極少見，吸呼系的傳染病，如流行性感冒，肺炎，腦膜炎，麻疹，天花，白喉，猩紅熱等也不如溫帶冬季之多，且氣溫之低，器物保藏較易持久，如前述之蘇聯魯道爾夫島按點於一九四二年封存該島之房屋，軍火庫，存糧，燃料及衣服，迄本年五月恢復，人員再度前往時，歷經五年之久，存儲之物資仍極完好。</p>
<p>但北極環境仍有若干條件影響人體健康者甚大，如冬季半年長夜漫淺，光綫極爲微弱，無日光之直接照射，缺少紫外光綫，一切活動均受限制，身體健康亦受影響，極地植物旣不易滋長，當地缺乏新鮮植物性食物及水果，營養性維他命供應斷絕，故極寒帶之居民患壞血症者甚爲普遍，面色蒼白；尤以冬夜期間爲甚，故探險隊或工作站人員，不僅以凖備罐頭食品及醃浸之魚肉食物爲已足，必需經常空運新鮮之菓蔬供應工作人員（埃斯基摩人因經常以半熟或生食動物肉血及海味，可免此病。）凡久居極地之人類對於傳染病之抵抗力很低，故外界病菌一經傳入，流行甚易，如埃斯基摩人自與文明社會人類交往後，體質已在逐漸衰弱中，人口亦不如往者之衆，其故在此。此外凍傷病尤宣隨時留意預防，尤以極低氣溫下全身性凍</p>
<h3>甜酸苦辣鹹</h3>
<p>— 趙南</p>
<p>我國古時，早就分甜酸苦辣鹹爲五味，但是，最近科學的硏究證明辣是一種刺激，是一種皮膚的惑覺。所以現今生理學家及心理學家所承認的味覺，不過是甜酸苦鹹四種。其他的種種滋味，就是由此四種主味配合而成。</p>
<p>糖是甜的，醋是酸的，黃蓮是苦的，鹽是鹹的。我們的舌頭究竟爲什麼道理能够把它們逐一辨別呢？這種味覺的生理作用，原來是化學作用。所以味覺對於物質的化學成分有一定的關係。蔗糖的甜味，就是因爲牠的分子中含有八個氫氧基的緣故；而一切有機化合物中的醇類及其衍化物等，也是由於牠組成的分子中所含　氧基的數目，而決定了牠甜味的强度，相同地，酸是由於氫游子，鹹是由於氣化鈉本身的分子。</p>
<p>對於味覺，濃度及溫度，都有很顯著的影響。拿甜味作爲例子來說，常溫所能感知的甜味爲〇·一％液，然而在零度則須〇·四液。同時我們能够感受甜味的最高溫度爲攝氏五十二度，過此就不容易辨別了。而鹽必須重於〇·〇〇七克，我們方才能够感覺。</p>
<p>我們的舌頭對於味感的靈敏，各部不同。一般舌的後半部味感機關附近最爲敏銳，舌緣舌尖較次，這種生理上神秘的構造，便會不知不覺地促使我們咽下喜歡的食物。舌頭對於滋味的反應速度，各部也不相同；大概舌脊比較舌尖反應迅速。我人對於苦味的反應，一般常較甜味爲慢，而殘留度則較强。因此，當你服用和有糖分的苦味藥時，最先感到的便是甜味，然後苦味。等到後來甜味已去而苦味依然殘留。</p>
<p>鹹味和甜味同時應用，他們便會相互消殺或竟加强。譬如將糖與鹽以適當的比率相互混和，然後溶解在水中，如果很淡，則沒有什麽特別的味；如果很濃，則兩味不但沒有做別，而且還帶遲鈍的鹹味。這種現象很有趣味，讀者不妨一試。</p>
<p>科學書評</p>
<h3>POTASH　SODA　PROCESS</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>雖然這一本書是用英文寫成的，而且全書除了序言與目錄以外只僅僅的五十頁，表面上看來好像沒有介紹的價値，其實不然。因爲作者在本書內所寫的只是關於由鹼灰（Potash）製造純鹼（又名洗濯蘇打Sodium　Carbonate）的新法，已經申請得專利，但作者不願自秘，很誠意的，很坦白的寫了出來，不但可以供給化工界人士的參考，而且可以說是我國製　工業的一個新發展。</p>
<p>在本書內主要的是作者介紹他發明的製純鹼新法，及依新法製鹼的設備等。在以前製純　的方法只有魯布蘭法（Leblanc　Process），蘇爾維法（Solvay　Process）及電解法（Electrolytic　Process．）三種；魯布蘭法的主要原料是芒硝，以前主要的來源是製鹽酸時的副產品，但是現在大部分的鹽　都由直接合成法製造（即使在中國也不後於人），所以魯布蘭法也就落伍了。蘇爾維法的主要原料是亞摩尼氣體（Ammonia　Gas），雖然這種原料在歐美各國是相當便宜，但在中國情形就不同，亞摩尼亞的價格是相當貴，並且專門製造的工廠也非常少，所以蘇爾維法的不適用於我國，是很明顯的了。最後關於電解法，那就更不適用於我國，因爲電解法主要的鹼類出產不是純鹼而是燒鹼（Sodium　Hydroxide），然後再拿燒鹼的溶液來通入二氧化碳氣體（Carbon　Dioxide　Gas）而製成純鹼，我想在中國或許沒有一個人肯這樣做吧！因爲根上燒鹼的價値就要比純鹼貴上幾倍。</p>
<p>但作者的新法就絕然不同了，它確實的能符合中國的一切現實情況，它的原料是最普通的鹼灰及食鹽；鹼灰的主要來源是在被人家倒去的或者被人認爲垃圾的草灰，穀灰，木材灰或桐榖灰中提取出來的；食鹽雖然是比草灰等這一類認爲廢物的原料要貴些，但也不會太驚人的。</p>
<p>出於鹼灰溶液與鹽灡的互相作用就產生了純鹼的晶體爽氯化鉀，再用作者提出的方法Chilling　Process將純鹼的晶體與氧化鉀在低溫下分離，再經過冷水的洗滌，離心，及重結晶等工作，就得到了極純粹的純鹼，也就是所謂洗濯蘇打。</p>
<p>或者在純鹼與氯化鉀的混合物未分開之時，通入二氧化碳氣體，使溶液中的純鹼都變爲小蘇打Sodium　Bicarbonate而沉澱，將沉澱的小蘇打濾出，再加强熱，放出原來所吸收的二氧化碳，成爲品質極高的純鹼，這也是作者所用方法之一的Carbonating　Process，這種方法不但可以製得品質極高的純鹼，而且還可以製造很純粹的小蘇打。</p>
<p>在書的最後一章，作者還寫了許多製燒鹼的方法，這些都是極有價値的，而且在普通的敎科書上及雜誌上是不容易見到的。</p>
<p>關於寫作的技術方面也可以說是井井有條。　毫不凌亂的，在每一章的前面都有一些理論的商討，然後繼之而上的才是實際的工作情形，這樣可以使讀老不會有盲無根據的感覺，但是所缺少的就是圖表。</p>
<p>我們很欽佩作者不自秘的科學新神，他的貢獻—Potash　Sode　Process—當於中國化工事業的發展有深遠的影響。</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　隻身漂泊他鄕的學徒</h3>
<p>編輯先生：非常抱歉，今天我很冒昧的給你寫了這一封信”我希望您在公務繁忙的當兒，化上幾分鐘的時間、來讀完它不要將它扔到字紙簍中去。我來到上海剛四天，以前，我在常熟一家離貨舖　當　徒，這是我父親在二年前爲了選擇的「前途」。其實那時候，我家中並不窮，我父親是一個百多畝田地的「地主」，家庭裏的經濟情形足够我繼續求學，但是我父親是一個道地的「重商主義者」，他認爲念書沒出息，反不如做生意，於是我便被送入了一家雜貨店去當學徒。我忍受了整整的兩年，假使再挨上一年半載，我也就能「滿師」，但是我不願意這樣做，我要追求我自己的前途，我有我的願望，我有我的抱負。</p>

<h3>Government Publishes Document Sent to Special Envoy Willkie: Explaining Steps Taken to Stabilize Politics and Economy, Determined to Overcome Crisis and Complete Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[This City News] Our government submitted a memorandum to Special Envoy Wendell Willkie on August 16, explaining the steps taken to stabilize politics and the economy, and its determination to overcome the current crisis and promote constitutional governance. (1) The armed forces of the Communist Party must be eliminated. (2) Controlling inflation is imperative and cannot be delayed any longer. (3) In provinces not affected by Communist disaster, economic recovery should be accelerated, and local governments should simultaneously implement necessary reforms. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously released the document in Nanjing and Shanghai yesterday (the 14th). The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>After General Albert Wedemeyer arrived in China, he submitted a memorandum to our government, stating: Based on past events, the Chinese government implemented various constructive measures in politics, economy, education, and social welfare between 1927 and 1937. Had it not been for the obstruction of the war, the aforementioned measures would have surely enabled China to become a strong and unified nation. To facilitate his mission, he deeply wished that the Chinese government would provide a memorandum explaining the steps taken to restore political and economic stability after the victory. Therefore, the Chinese government submitted the following memorandum to General Wedemeyer on August 16.</p>
<p>General Statement Regarding Measures and Policies of the Chinese Government</p>
<p>1. On the day of the victory, the Chinese government faced the following problems:</p>
<p>(1) The problem of the Chinese Communist Party. In addition to possessing a regular army of 310,000 men, they also had so-called "people's militias," whose numbers were even greater. A large number of un-surrendered and un-disarmed Japanese and puppet troops existed in the Northeast, providing the Chinese Communists with the opportunity to acquire more sophisticated equipment.</p>
<p>(2) The inflation caused by the long-term war of resistance endangered the economic life of the entire country.</p>
<p>(3) More than 90 percent of China's railways were completely shut down, and inland river shipping was extremely scarce. As a result, the work of repatriation and restoring order in the Japanese-occupied areas was very difficult. Many of the pre-war industrial and mining factories had been recovered, but many were unable to resume operation as a result.</p>
<p>(4) After eight years of neglect and destruction by the enemy and puppets, the rural economy suffered from a widespread shortage of labor, livestock, and fertilizer, resulting in a sharp decline in agricultural production that urgently needed to be restored. For example, annual cotton production fell from 16,180,000 piculs in 1937 to 5,320,000 piculs, only one-third of pre-war production.</p>
<p>(5) There were more than one million Japanese troops in mainland China, and approximately the same number in the Northeast. Six hundred thousand puppet troops were distributed throughout mainland China, and another 330,000 lived in the Northeast. Due to the Soviet Union's participation in the Far Eastern War, the Soviet Union also had 600,000 to 700,000 troops stationed throughout the Northeast.</p>
<p>(6) Finally, there was the issue of fulfilling the government's pre-war and wartime political promises: the convening of the National Assembly, the drafting of a constitution, the Kuomintang's return of power to the people, the end of one-party rule, and the abolition of the press censorship system were all major promises that the government urgently needed to fulfill.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned difficult problems were all issues that the government had to address simultaneously on the day of Japan's surrender. The magnitude of the responsibility was beyond the capacity of the government's existing institutions at the time. These problems were not only important and complex in themselves, but many were also things that the government had never experienced before.</p>
<h3>Resistance to Both Hinders, Reconstruction Difficult</h3>
<p>2. When the Chinese government sent Japanese soldiers and expatriates back home, and transported troops by sea and air to various places to expedite the takeover work, it received assistance from the US military stationed in China. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration made significant contributions to the repatriation of refugees and other urgent relief and rehabilitation matters. At the same time, the Chinese government itself had done its best within the limits of what the environment allowed to seek solutions to various problems. First, it began to reorganize the army and tighten finances. Second, it sought to restore transportation, such as railways, highways, waterways, public utilities, and water conservancy projects. Third, it devoted itself to the resumption of industrial and mining operations and steel plants (including those dismantled by the Communist army or destroyed by the Communist Party in the Northeast), and to the rescue of the textile industry and other industries on the verge of collapse. Fourth, it devoted itself to the establishment of grassroots political organizations, such as the organization of local villages and towns, and the restoration and reconstruction of schools at all levels. Fifth, the government had also done its best to help the rural economy recover. As far as cotton is concerned, the government's promotional work over the past year and a half is expected to increase cotton production to 11 million piculs this year, doubling the year of victory in the War of Resistance. All these efforts require a lot of talent, management and economics.</p>
<p>If we judge the government's work during this period, we must remember that the foundation of Chinese society was not sound, and most of its land had been occupied for many years. The initial new economic foundation established before the war, that is, since 1927, was also destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, its recovery work was very difficult and complex.</p>
<p>If the government's efforts in repatriation and construction were not hindered by the existence of the following two major obstacles, it would have achieved greater results, and China's current political and economic situation would have been brighter. The so-called two major obstacles are the long-standing and unresolved issue of the Communist Party and the inflation left over from the war.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party's participation in the Northeast during and after the Soviet occupation of the Northeast constituted a major factor in the stalemate of the Communist Party issue after the victory. The Communist Party's armed hostility was the biggest obstacle to the government's repatriation work and the restoration of public order, especially in the recovered areas. For example, while the government tried to restore major transportation lines in many ways, the Communist Party's army tried its best to carry out sabotage, demolishing newly repaired railways, cutting telegraph and telephone lines, and ravaging the countryside.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's attitude became increasingly tougher because the government failed to receive the surrender and disarm the Japanese and puppet troops in the Northeast. After the National Assembly was convened at the end of last year, the Communist Party openly opposed the constitution passed by the assembly, and the path to a political solution was clearly hopeless. At this time, the Communist Party had decided to launch a large-scale military offensive immediately. At a time when various construction projects required the government to concentrate its attention and start quickly, it encountered this situation, and the government's difficulties and disappointments were beyond description.</p>
<p>Since the Communist Party issue was unresolved, the military reorganization plan could not be realized because the Communist Party refused to implement it. The downsizing of the army could not but be hit, and as a result, the fiscal austerity policy could not be implemented, and inflation continued to rise, endangering the entire political and economic life of China. The government's administrative efficiency was reduced, and the morale of the army was affected. The salaries of most civil servants could not even maintain the minimum standard of living. Some government personnel were forced to take on other jobs to maintain their livelihood, while others simply abandoned their positions and switched to other positions with higher incomes. To this day, the treatment of civil servants who have been impoverished for a long time has not been effectively improved. However, the vast majority of civil servants still diligently perform their duties despite such difficult living conditions, which is truly amazing. The loyalty of these civil servants is comparable to the perseverance of the Chinese people in enduring suffering during the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Constitutional System, the Government Has Never Interrupted or Slacked Off, In Terms of Method, There May Be Some Shortcomings</h3>
<p>3. The National Government can be criticized in various ways, but it cannot be accused of not having done its best to prepare for the democratic politics planned by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. All responsible people in the Kuomintang have always believed that if the Kuomintang cannot establish a government representing the entire people and allow the existence of multiple parties, it cannot be said that it has implemented the Kuomintang's basic party platform. Everyone who has a slight position in the party believes that once the basic conditions indicated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen are met, "political tutelage" must end. The entire Kuomintang has never deviated from this basic political belief.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the entire country, from top to bottom, not only resolutely resisted the enemy, but also did its best to preserve the foundation established in politics and economy since 1927. The general opinion in the Kuomintang was that although the war existed, the Kuomintang's previous preparations for constitutional governance could not be destroyed by the war. Therefore, in 1938, the government convened the National Political Council to obtain more opinions to help promote national policies. Except for those related to military strategy, the council became the national public opinion organ during the war. At a time when the nation was struggling for life and death, the Kuomintang opened up the government in advance and accepted external public inquiries and criticisms. To this day, this system of making public affairs known to public opinion continues to develop. Although the 200 members of the first National Political Council were selected by the National Government based on occupation and geographic distribution principles, the general public recognized that they could truly represent all politically conscious strata of the country. When the second National Political Council convened in early 1940, there were 240 councilors, more than 90 of whom were elected for the first time by the provisional provincial and municipal councils based on geographic and occupational foundations. When the third National Political Council convened in 1942, 164 of the 240 members were elected by the provinces and cities. Currently, as the council is about to end, there are 362 councilors, of which 227 were elected by the provincial and municipal councils.</p>
<p>In September 1938, two months after the opening of the first National Political Council, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Provincial Council Regulations. These councils have now been established in almost all provinces, and the number of their elected members has been increasing in each session. Currently, the councilors of some provinces are entirely elected by the people. Municipal and county councils have also been established according to similar methods. Therefore, when the country was at war and military affairs were paramount, the government continued to do its best to establish and promote the constitutional system, without ever interrupting or slacking off.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, although there were many reasons for the continued existence of the press censorship system, the government resolutely abolished it. In November 1946, it convened the National Assembly again and passed the draft constitution. Although the Kuomintang was still the majority party in the government, the one-party government came to an end. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have joined the government. In today's China, the expression of national public opinion has many organizations, which is unprecedented. Observers who are familiar with China's past situation will be able to notice this. This phenomenon is due to the abolition of press censorship, the convening of the National Assembly, the participation of other parties in the government, the implementation of the Executive Yuan's responsibilities, and the public discussions of the National Political Council. At the same time, the government's love for its policies and administration is sufficient to promote the development of public opinion and bring the government and the people closer together.</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang came to power, in order to achieve its political goals, there may be some shortcomings in the method, but the Kuomintang has never deviated from its consistent political direction. The progress of its work may inevitably be delayed due to the difficulties of the environment, but in the 20 years of the Kuomintang's rule, every step forward is counted as a step forward, and there has never been a case of advancing and then retreating.</p>
<h3>Vast Territory, Weak Foundation</h3>
<p>Critics Cannot Ignore</p>
<p>4. People who criticize China often ignore the vastness of China, the weakness of its political, economic, and social organization, and the complexity of its internal problems. Their observations and judgments are often dominated by the phenomena of a particular period, forgetting its background.</p>
<p>1927 to 1937 was the period when the power of the National Government was first tested. During this period, the government never had more than six months of peace. Let us briefly review the situation during these ten years. When the government was still in Guangzhou in 1926, it sent troops to conquer the northern warlords. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the warlords were not yet eliminated, and the remnants of the old forces and the Communists were constantly conspiring to make trouble. In Chongqing, the wartime capital, open shops selling opium were all over the streets. Not only Chongqing, but also most other provinces and cities throughout the country were almost like this. Extraterritoriality for foreigners continued to exist. Major countries, even the United States, still held a cold and suspicious attitude towards the National Government. Since Japan openly invaded on September 18, 1931, the government had to resist the invasion while suppressing the Communist Party's armed rebellion in various parts of the south. However, in these ten years of internal and external attacks and numerous difficulties, the government was still able to carry out national construction work. By the time before the war, that is, in 1937, nearly 5,000 kilometers of new railways and nearly 100,000 kilometers of new highways had been built, and schools, parks, hospitals, and municipal central districts had been added in various places. The number of middle schools increased threefold, and the number of colleges and universities increased twofold. In 1936, the number of students in middle schools and vocational schools was nearly 600,000. The illiteracy rate was reduced by about 20 percent in ten years. The manufacturing of new-style arsenals also began in 1926. By the time of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China's arsenals were able to supply all the rifles, hand grenades, machine guns, mortars, and various accessories needed by the troops. The anti-drug movement was also widely launched during this period, and the number of drug offenders decreased rapidly. By the end of 1938, there were no open opium dens in the areas under the control of the Kuomintang government.</p>
<p>When the all-out war broke out in 1937, Japanese financial experts predicted that China's finances would collapse within a few months. The financial problems China encountered during the eight-year war of resistance were indeed difficult and complex. However, the government was able to survive the initial stage of the war (that is, the most dangerous stage of the war) without any serious financial crisis because it had taken a number of strong measures before the war, such as creating legal tender, concentrating cash reserves, and reforming the tax and banking systems.</p>
<p>In short, from the establishment of the National Government's capital in Nanjing in 1927 to the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, this stage was a period when the Kuomintang suffered a serious test. During this period, although the government was constantly threatened and faced with difficulties both internally and externally, its goal was very simple, that is, to internally suppress the Communist Party, which was harming the country and the people, and to externally resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. The will was unified, the strength was concentrated, and the relationship between China and its neighboring countries was not as complex as it is today. Therefore, it was ultimately able to make this period a period of construction. Industry and commerce developed, and the people in cities and villages were able to plan for their future and place their hopes. Industrial production in 1936 was higher than at any time before, and the general society felt prosperous.</p>

<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Youth League's Central Committee Held, Chairman Chiang Delivers Instructions in Person, Instructions on Working and Conducting Oneself</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The closing ceremony of the Second Plenary Session of the Youth League and the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. Chairman Chiang presided over the ceremony in person and delivered a speech for about an hour. Chairman Chiang first said: Our party has a long history of revolution and excellent cadres, but in recent years it has been threatened by the Communist Party, which is very painful. When the Youth League was established, I had great hopes, but the League failed to make up for all the shortcomings within the party. Now, in order to unify the organization and concentrate forces, the party and the League must merge. Chairman Chiang then encouraged the attendees to act and conduct themselves properly, and said: In addition to the fundamental conflict of life with the Communist Party, our party should cooperate with other parties as much as possible, otherwise it will be the failure of our party. The principles of being a person should be based on respecting the old, loving the young, being pragmatic, self-denying, diligent, and thrifty, working together in harmony, and making joint efforts. After the merger of the party and the League, if there are any uncoordinated situations, the League should be responsible. Chairman Chiang continued to explain the issues after the merger of the party and the League, saying: If both sides still have doubts, it is unnecessary, and quoting the Bible as proof that "You will not grow unless you are buried," saying that if the seeds of the League are not buried in the party, they cannot undergo metabolism. The party needs the League's efforts to improve very much. Chairman Chiang also emphasized: (1) In the future, we must strengthen organization and training, and pay special attention to cadre training and self-training. (2) The principles of doing things should pay attention to the spirit and methods of science, and conduct practical research. (3) Cadres should lead by example in order to lead comrades. Finally, he said: In the past, our party comrades often made the mistake of failing to implement resolutions and plans, not checking the results, and not asking about the effects. In the future, we should pay attention to improvement.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] President Chiang hosted a tea party at the Lixingshe Club on the afternoon of the 14th to entertain the executive and supervisory members, executive and supervisory officers, and attendees from various places of the party and the League, totaling more than 400 people.

<h3>Eliminating Communist Armed Forces, Maintaining Peace in the Far East, Inflation Must Be Controlled</h3>
<p>The various problems the government is encountering today are more complex than before the War of Resistance, but their sinister and difficult situation is similar to the period from 1937 to 1942 when China was forced to resist Japan alone. Whether the current government led by the Kuomintang can still overcome various new dangers and difficulties as it did before and during the war remains to be seen.</p>
<p>However, it is very clear that the Kuomintang and the current government's determination to overcome this new crisis has not weakened. As for the policies prepared to deal with this crisis, here is a brief description of what the government is paying special attention to: First, the armed forces of the Communist Party must be eliminated. The government's decision and its success or failure are not only related to the fate of the government itself, but also to whether China can achieve peace and security in the entire Far East. Therefore, the government is unwilling to consider any incomplete solution. Second, inflation must be controlled. Even if effective control methods need to be implemented step by step, the start of implementation should not be delayed any longer, as this is the root of various political, economic, and social pathologies. Third, in the provinces not harmed by the Communist Party, the government should do its best to accelerate economic recovery, and local governments will also implement necessary reforms at the same time. Finally, the government will move towards the goal of establishing constitutional governance with unyielding spirit. No matter what difficulties the Communist rebellion and other political factors can create for the achievement of this goal, the government is still prepared to implement the law passed last year. An ideal democratic constitutional government cannot be created overnight, but the general opinion within the government is that the best policy to achieve this goal is to start constitutional governance as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Resigns as Secretary-General</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Responsible sources said that Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang, submitted his resignation to President Chiang after the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session, but did not state the reasons.

<h3>Material Exchange Inside and Outside Shanhaiguan Actively Underway</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Material exchange inside and outside Shanhaiguan is about to start actively.

<h3>Lei Zhen Discusses My Stance on the Peace Conference: Efforts Should Be Made to Urge the Soviet Union to Participate So That the Purpose of the Peace Conference Can Be Realized.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Political Affairs Committee Member and Director of the Asia-East Association, Mr. Lei Zhen, spoke with reporters yesterday regarding the Japanese peace treaty. He believes that the procedures and content of the peace conference should be decided upon by the Four Powers Conference first, and then submitted to the Eleven-Nation Conference of the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. Regarding the peace conference, Mr. Lei stated that our country should make every effort to urge the Soviet Union to participate. If the Soviet Union refuses to participate, our country will also find it difficult to attend. If the Soviet Union does not participate in the peace conference, issues such as the Northeast problem and the Korean problem will be difficult to resolve, and the purpose of the peace conference will not be realized.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Sources in diplomatic circles reveal that our country has requested the Far Eastern Commission that, in the total amount of reparations from Japan in the future, our country should receive 40 percent. However, this has not yet been approved. The United States, in principle, agrees that our country should receive more reparations, but hopes to slightly reduce the percentage. The United Kingdom has expressed opposition, because if this request is approved, the British Empire has many autonomous territories, and the percentage received by each unit will be very small. The Soviet Union also does not express agreement, the key being the issue of overseas assets. China, the United Kingdom, and the United States all advocate that the assets of Japan's overseas territories and investments in occupied areas should be listed as reparations, while the Soviet Union insists that such materials should be interpreted as war booty and obtained by the occupying forces. This dispute has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>China Islamic Association Holds Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors</h3>

<h3>Shenyang City's Atmosphere Renewed: Jeeps with Women Greatly Reduced; Owners of Several Luxurious Houses Busy Selling</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch, Shenyang, 14th dispatch] Since Chen Cheng took charge of the Northeast Headquarters, he has greatly rectified matters. Personnel of military and political organs here are each vigilant. Jeeps and trucks speeding through the city with women have been greatly reduced. The owners of several luxurious houses in Shenyang are busy transferring ownership, with only duty soldiers left to guard the houses. Director Chen, in civilian clothes, inspected Huanggu Tun and visited a police substation yesterday, learning from the police officers that the director of the substation does not often come to the station.

<p>[Another dispatch] South and southwest of Hefei's outer suburbs, since the bandit army was defeated at Taoxi Town on the 13th, there has been no change in the situation today. Order within Hefei city is still stable, but fuel prices have skyrocketed, with firewood selling for 80,000 yuan per load. The price of cigarettes has increased the most. The bandits in Lu'an are the 19th, 20th, 25th, and 27th Regiments of Liu Bocheng's Third Column, while those entrenched in Shucheng are the 23rd Regiment of the Third Column, all of whom are trapped. The movements of over 10,000 bandits who fled to various places in Lujiang and Tongcheng are still unclear. It is reported that 70,000 to 80,000 bandits who fled to western and central Anhui have been battered by the National Army on all sides in the past ten days and are now in a difficult situation. According to a military official here, the bandits have three options for finding a way out: crossing the Yangtze River, fleeing to northern Jiangsu, or entrenching themselves in the Dabie Mountains. However, the current situation makes all of these impossible.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Sixty bandits captured from Taoxi Town are in a wretched state like beggars, all of whom are strong young men in their twenties who were coerced from Shandong, Henan and Hebei. They expressed that they were unwilling to fight and would scatter like birds and beasts upon encountering the National Army's fierce artillery fire. Furthermore, the bandit army's designations are kept extremely secret, with soldiers only knowing the faces of their company and platoon leaders but not their names.</p>

<h3>Dai Chuanxian Appointed Chairman of the County Magistrate Selection Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th dispatch] Order of the National Government, September 13th: Dai Chuanxian is specially appointed as the chairman of the County Magistrate Selection Committee for Passed Higher Examinations.

<h3>State-Owned Transportation Enterprises Still Difficult to Be Self-Sufficient, Ministry of Communications Believes Continued Subsidies Are Necessary</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch, Nanjing, 14th dispatch] The Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Communications and relevant ministries to cancel subsidies for state-owned enterprises starting in October, hoping that they could seek self-sufficiency. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Communications convened relevant parties for consultations. They generally believed that increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and reducing staff within their own scope were urgent matters. However, under the current circumstances, subsidies seemed necessary to continue. Taking the postal service as an example, according to current market prices, a plain letter needs to cost 2,500 yuan to maintain costs. However, if the price is quadrupled, the number of letter senders will inevitably decrease, and the goal of self-sufficiency cannot be achieved. The postal service still hopes for subsidies. The post office also plans to reduce staff and wages, and adopt a zone-based pricing method to reduce the burden on the people. In terms of telecommunications, ordinary commercial telegrams need to be doubled, i.e., increased from 1,000 yuan per word to 2,000 yuan to maintain operations. Railways, except for the Jinghu Railway, are losing heavily. If they are to be self-sufficient, passenger and freight rates need to be increased by more than three times. As for highways, none of the lines across the country can maintain the current state. Self-sufficiency is almost impossible, and continued subsidies are necessary.</p>

<h3>Qingdao American Military Pilot's Forced Landing in Bandit Area and Dangerous Experience: The United States Exchanged Some Materials to Get Him Back</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch, Qingdao, 13th dispatch] U.S. Marine Corps Captain Winters, who was piloting a plane, was forced to land on the sea off the Shandong Peninsula because he ran out of gasoline and returned to Qingdao on the 11th after staying in the bandit area for two weeks. According to his account: On the 27th, while practicing flying, he made a forced landing on the coast about 130 kilometers northeast of Qingdao. The place is now known to be Rushankou east of Haiyang County. He was immediately detained by the local guerrillas and sent to live in Xiacun, about five kilometers from the coast. He was not mistreated. He was then sent to Wendeng. The person he contacted daily was a Communist Party member who could speak English, claiming to be Lieutenant Colonel Wang, who gave him political propaganda talks. Winters relied entirely on walking on foot in the Communist area, covering hundreds of li. According to reporters, the Communist side had asked the U.S. military liaison officer for US$80,000 in exchange for Winters, but the result was likely unsuccessful. The U.S. military authorities did not deny that some materials were given to the Communist side. In the Communist area, Winters was surrounded by curious people who were very interested in his thick golden hair.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Minister Bai's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session (Continued-3)</h3>
<p>(II) Education System: An excellent military officer training system is fundamental to building a strong army. Since its establishment, the Ministry of National Defense has paid special attention to improving the education system. The formulated education system and key implementation points are described as follows: 1. The principles for establishing a military officer education system are to enhance officers' scientific literacy and cultivate unified commanders and staff officers for the army, navy, and air force. Other key considerations include strengthening joint logistics training, specialized technical training, and cultivating reserve officers. 2. The levels of military officer education are divided into four categories: basic officer education, advanced education, specialized staff education, and higher national defense education. One, the basic officer education level includes the establishment of a unified army, navy, and air force joint training military academy, the establishment of an officer training center, and the creation of reserve officer training groups to cultivate basic cadres for the national defense forces. Two, advanced education is provided by branch schools established by each service. Three, advanced staff officer education is provided by the Staff College, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense. Four, higher national defense education is provided by the National Defense University, which trains outstanding military officers and civilians to become senior military talents and national defense economic and technical experts, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, special schools are established as needed to provide specialized training, and a Military Science Research Institute is established, hiring scientific experts to conduct research. 3. Regarding the implementation: The Military Academy and Officer Training Corps are currently being prepared for establishment. Primary classes of the Army Combined Arms Schools will be established this autumn (the 36th year of the Republic), and advanced classes are scheduled to be established next year (the 37th year of the Republic). Naval and Air Force schools are also under preparation. Planning for the Staff College has begun, and it is expected to be established this winter (the 36th year of the Republic). The National Defense University is scheduled to be established in the 39th year of the Republic. The Military Science Academy has been discussed with the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry has entrusted various ordinary universities to handle it first.</p>
<p>(III) Supply System: The quality of the supply system directly affects the well-being of officers and soldiers and is indirectly related to the combat effectiveness of the front lines. It is also an important part of the military system. The Ministry of National Defense has carefully designed it to establish a good supply system, as described below: One, separate finance and management. In the past, financial and material matters were managed by quartermaster personnel. Now, following the spirit of establishing laws and regulations, finance and management are separated into two systems, with clear divisions of personnel and institutions, each responsible for their own duties. Two, separate budget and finance. Following the principle of separating budget and accounting responsibilities, the Ministry and all subordinate agencies and units have separate budget personnel to handle budget preparation, review, allocation, supervision, pre-expenditure verification and certification, and periodic post-expenditure reporting, so that the Ministry can fully control the budget. Accounting revenue and expenditure matters are managed by the finance department, and independent military expenditure is implemented, so that business units do not handle cash receipts and disbursements, and the public treasury system is strictly enforced to bring the accounting system into order. Three, promote in-kind supply. This system has been implemented for a long time, and efforts are still being made to thoroughly improve it. Military equipment, food, clothing, equipment, fuel, etc., are all supplied in-kind to avoid entrusting units, causing inconvenience, or creating corruption. Its implementation is based on the principle of the supervisor implementing the supply according to the prescribed plan without waiting for requests from all parties. Four, strive to verify the number of soldiers. The deep-rooted problem of ghost soldiers has been corrected repeatedly, but it is still difficult to eliminate. In order to completely correct this problem, the Ministry of National Defense has recently developed a daily personnel report form. In the future, all allowances and supplies will be based on the figures in the daily report form. If it can be implemented smoothly, the problem of ghost soldiers can be eradicated. At the same time, a method of personnel and horse verification is being drafted and implemented to complement the reporting method.</p>
<p>D. General Overview of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>(I) General Situation of the Communist Bandits: The Communist bandits' conspiracy to subvert the government and divide the country has aroused public indignation and needs no further explanation. During the War of Resistance, they specialized in attacking friendly forces. After Japan's surrender, they relied on foreign aid to obtain Japanese equipment and coerced the people into becoming bandits. Their current situation is as follows: Total force of approximately 860,150 people, with 613,150 in field units and 247,000 in military region units. Approximately 444,000 are located outside the passes, and approximately 416,150 are located inside the passes.</p>
<p>(II) General Situation of Operations in the Past Six Months: Since the Third Plenary Session, the Ministry of National Defense has continued to suppress the bandits under political guidance. In the past six months, our loyal and brave officers and soldiers have fought bravely, first occupying the bandit's Yan'an, and then suppressing the bandit's stubborn resistance in the Yimeng Mountain area, capturing their base areas. They have also launched strong attacks on the bandit army in the Northeast, which colludes with Korean and Mongolian Communist bandits and uses Japanese surrendered soldiers, repelled multiple invasions by bandits in Shanxi, and are now preparing to counterattack the bandits who have crossed the Luo River. The bandit forces of Liu Bocheng in northern Henan have been attacked multiple times, and their main force has been cut off from their retreat north, so they have fled to the vicinity of the Dabie Mountains and are being encircled and annihilated. Since the government issued the general mobilization order and improved allowances, morale has been revived, and officers and soldiers are deeply grateful. The general situation of operations in the past six months is described as follows: One, Northeast: The bandits crossed the Songhua River and invaded five times. In late February, the bandits invaded Changchun in three routes. After being repelled by our forces, in late May, the bandits launched a large-scale operation to attack Sipingjie. The bandits, colluding with Korean and Mongolian Communist bandits and Japanese prisoners of war, numbered approximately 200,000 and attacked in five routes. The defending troops of Chen Mingren, who bravely defended Sipingjie, cooperated with north and south pincers after defending for 19 days, and met at Sipingjie on June 20, annihilating approximately 150,000 bandits. We have now adjusted our troops, reorganized our posture, completed all preparations, and formulated a resolution to annihilate the bandits again. Two, Northern Hebei: In the past six months, there have been two major operations in northern Hebei. In April, the bandit Nie Rongzhen attacked Shijiazhuang without success, and then used his main force to attack Niangziguan along the Zhengtai Road, attempting to join forces with the Shanxi bandits Chen Geng and He Long to attack Taiyuan. We annihilated more than 10,000 of them between Chouyang and Yuci. The bandit Nie still fled back to central Hebei. In late June, the Hebei bandits attacked Baoding again. In early July, our reinforcements lifted the siege of Baoding and took advantage of the victory to recover nine counties, including Zhengding and Wangdu. The bandits fled to the Fuping Mountain area. Three, Northern Shaanxi: In mid-March, the National Army advanced from Luochuan and Yichuan to suppress the bandits in Yan'an. On the 19th, Yan'an was recovered. Most of the bandits fled to Shanxi, and a portion fled to the Gansu border. In early May, in the Battle of Heshui, the bandits on the Gansu border were defeated. The remnants fled back to Huanxian. In early August, the bandits attacked Yulin. After fierce fighting by our defending troops and the northbound reinforcements, the bandits suffered 30,000 casualties by the 20th, and the remnants were scattered and are being mopped up. Four, Northern Henan: The bandits in northern Henan launched three operations in the past six months. First, in mid-March, they attacked Xinxiang and Jixian. After suffering losses, they fell into Tangyin and Anchang. After defending for two months, they were repelled. Secondly, in June, Liu Bocheng launched the western Shandong operation, attempting to assist the bandit Chen Yi in central Shandong. We defended Heze and Quanxiang, cut off the bandit Liu Bocheng's retreat, and launched a counterattack. A portion of the bandits fled to the border between Henan and Anhui. The Shanxi bandit Chen Geng attacked western Henan to support Liu Bocheng. We are currently blocking them in the vicinity of Luoning. Five, Shandong: In the past six months, there have been multiple operations in Shandong, and the results achieved have been the greatest, including the suppression of the bandits in the Yimeng Mountain area, the opening of the Jiaoji Railway, and the dismemberment of the bandit Chen Yi's forces. The main points are described as follows: One, Linqu Operation. In early February, our north and south army groups advanced to suppress the bandits in southern Shandong. On February 15, Linqu was recovered. Because the northern army group was defeated at Laiwu Tusi Pass, the deployment was readjusted. Two, Operation in the Yimeng Mountain Area. In April, our southern army group continued to advance to suppress the bandits in the Yimeng Mountain area, first occupying Xintai and Laiwu. In mid-July, their main force was defeated in Nanma and Linqu, annihilating more than 50,000 bandits. It is reported that approximately 20,000 bandits remain after the encirclement and annihilation of those who fled to western Shandong. The Jiaoji Railway was also completely recovered on August 24. Except for a portion of the bandit army in Jiaodong, the entire territory of Shandong is now under our control. Those in the Rizhao coastal area are currently being encircled and annihilated.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Put Yourself in China's Shoes and Think!</h3>
<p>After General Wedemeyer left China, he sorted out the data in Honolulu and will report the results of this trip to the US President. In order for the US Special Envoy to easily understand the actual situation in China, the Chinese government presented a memorandum to the Special Envoy before he left China. Director Dong of the News Bureau, Xian Guang, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to publish this memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the press.</p>
<p>In this memorandum, the Chinese government frankly pointed out the various difficulties encountered after the war, and frankly admitted the difficulty of national construction and reconstruction after the war, but also expressed the government's unwavering determination to revive and build the country.</p>
<p>We want our American friends to put themselves in China's shoes and think. China is an agricultural country, and a backward agricultural country. During the War of Resistance, the agricultural areas with the richest production were all occupied by the Japanese army, and suffered the enemy's destruction and damage. For eight years, China's agricultural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Whether it is manpower, livestock, or fertilizer, there is a shortage. The improvement of agricultural production methods is even more out of the question. Therefore, after the victory, even if there was no Communist Party problem that deepened the decline of the rural economy, China's agricultural production could not be restored for a while. The severity of China's food problem after the war is by no means accidental. What's more, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, before we had a chance to catch our breath, the Communist Party problem arose. In addition to possessing more than 300,000 regular troops, the Communist bandits also have many so-called "people's armies." They not only rebelled and attempted to expand their territory, but also had their followers disrupt and destroy in various parts of the country, so that the people could not live and work in peace, in an attempt to seize power. The Communist bandits knew that transportation was the lifeline of the country, so they destroyed railway transportation in various places. Ninety percent of the country's railways were at a standstill. Inland river shipping was also unable to run smoothly due to the lack of transport ships and local unrest. The Communist bandits also knew that mineral products and rural areas were the country's only resources, so they did their best to disrupt and destroy them in various places, so that mineral products could not be mined and farmers could not cultivate the land with peace of mind. Under such circumstances, how could China not feel the panic of material shortage?</p>
<p>In terms of China's current national economy, the biggest difficulty is the endless currency inflation. The creation of this phenomenon cannot but be said to be the result of the eight-year War of Resistance and the two-year civil war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, China fought alone, without foreign aid. Economically, it had to rely entirely on issuing banknotes to maintain itself. During these eight years, other expenses aside, the military expenditure alone was really considerable. In order to implement the national policy of resisting Japan, China caused currency inflation. Although the lives of the people across the country were directly threatened, they had no complaints. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government could have started to reorganize or reform the currency system to stabilize the domestic financial situation. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party deliberately created a two-year civil war. Because of the existence of the Communist bandits, the troop reorganization plan could not be implemented, so the austerity policy was just empty talk, and the continued inflation of the currency caused the current situation. On the surface, the government seems to be fully responsible for the creation of the current situation; but in reality, it should be blamed on the Japanese invaders and the Communist bandits. Now that the Japanese invaders have been defeated, they should compensate China for its losses; but the peace conference with Japan is far away, and the compensation problem cannot be solved for a while, so we cannot get compensation. At the same time, the Communist bandit problem cannot be solved in the short term because of the previous "peace talks." Therefore, those who do not know the truth inevitably express pessimistic views on China's economic future.</p>
<p>The United States is located in the Western Hemisphere. Although it once participated in the war and sacrificed a lot of manpower and material resources, its country did not directly suffer the catastrophe of war. Therefore, after the war, it is still a paradise on earth. "The well-fed do not know the hunger of the starving." Anyone who cannot put themselves in China's shoes and think will not deeply appreciate the difficulties and pain that China has suffered. We do not want to say more, nor do we want to have the mentality of relying solely on foreign aid, but we still believe that China and the United States have a long history of good relations, and the United States has a moral responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East. Therefore, we hope that the United States, after reading our memorandum, can put themselves in China's shoes and think: Is China's difficulty something that a war-weary country can easily overcome?</p>
<h3>The Kuomintang's New Life Exam</h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Joint Meeting of the Central Party and the Party Group closed on the 13th. From now on, members of the Three People's Principles Youth League will jointly devote themselves to the work of revolutionary construction in the name of Kuomintang members. The Kuomintang President has already instructed the tasks and reform points of the Kuomintang in the conference. Central Committee Member Song Ziwen and others suggested organizing a Comrades Mutual Aid Association to raise funds to donate to the families of party members who died for the War of Resistance Against Japan and the suppression of bandits. Mr. Song took the lead in donating private property, donating all his shares in the China Construction Bank Company for this fund. This cannot but be regarded as a symbol of the Kuomintang's new life. The conference declaration said: "We are willing to promote the new life of the party with the unity and struggle of the party, to create the driving force of the revolution with the new life of the party, and to achieve a comprehensive reform of politics and economy with the driving force of the revolution." We are extremely looking forward to these beautiful words, starting from Mr. Zhu's wise move of donating private property, all Kuomintang members can truly "answer expectations with facts and prove determination with actions." For the sake of China's future, we are very much looking forward to the Kuomintang's new life.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang's leaders made a realistic and frank self-examination in the joint meeting of the party and the group, explaining where the party's success was in the past, and where its failure was. When it came to the most painful part, they felt deeply ashamed of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier. Some foreign reporters heard the word "failure" and spread it in surprise, thinking that no politicians in the world had ever publicly admitted "failure" like the Kuomintang President this time. In fact, this is precisely the traditional virtue of the Chinese teaching "blaming oneself and lightly blaming others," and it is also the spiritual foundation for the Kuomintang to overcome every obstacle. Moreover, there is a Western proverb that "failure is the mother of success," so even if there is failure, it is not enough to worry about. What's more, today the Kuomintang members are united and invigorated. During the national suppression of bandits and rebellion, if they can always be the vanguard of the people, then the Kuomintang's new life will be 100% guaranteed. What "failure" is there?</p>
<p>Today's situation in China is indeed very difficult. All reforms seem to be urgent, and in fact, the key to turning danger into safety and turning chaos into order lies only in a thought in the minds of the people across the country. The so-called "Han Nian" means "publicly hating selfishness and forgetting the family for the sake of the country." To make such a big shift in the psychology of the people across the country, the government must first have this ambition. The Kuomintang is still the largest party in power today. Therefore, only the self-denial and dedication of the Kuomintang members can promote the new life of the Kuomintang, and the new life of the Kuomintang is in fact the cornerstone of the new life of the whole of China. The fate of the Kuomintang and the fate of China are already inseparable. Very simply, we would like to first take this matter—whether all Kuomintang members with financial resources can follow Mr. Zhu Ziwen and donate all or part of their private property to repay the party and the country—as an exam to see whether the Kuomintang can thoroughly start a new life.</p>

<h3>Marshall Reiterates Determination to Support UN Organizations and Willing to Cooperatively Promote Global Stability</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] US Secretary of State Marshall delivered an important speech tonight at the American United Nations Association, clarifying the US's overall policy toward the upcoming UN General Assembly on the 16th, reiterating the US's determination to support UN organizations, urging the General Assembly to take immediate action to remove the direct threat to Greek independence from the Soviet Balkan satellite states, and to conclude peace treaties with Japan, Germany, Austria and other countries as soon as possible. It is said that the aid of the three countries of Southern Bao'a to the Greek guerrillas directly threatens the territorial integrity and political independence of that country, and we express our deep concern, and will work with other member states to resist such aggression. The United States has no other intention than to pacify the Balkan riots, and hopes that the General Assembly can find a way to achieve this goal. The United States will support the United Nations in two ways: (1) to strive to complete the peace treaties of other countries and restore the normal environment in which UN organizations can perform their duties. Another (1) is to cooperate with various countries to promote the world's economic situation and achieve the economic conditions necessary for international stability. However, it is a serious mistake to say that every international issue should be handled by UN organizations. (Note that this statement may refer to its European Recovery Program, which the Soviet Union has previously criticized for disregarding UN organizations). The US delegation will propose many items at the General Assembly, hoping to help solve some of the issues that are currently disrupting normal international relations, among which we pay special attention to the Greek and Palestinian issues. However, when UN organizations find ways to overcome various obstacles to reaching agreements on common issues, they have not exhausted their potential in the Charter. The United States does not believe that the veto provisions of the UN Charter need to be significantly revised. In addition, the United States hopes to admit various countries that have reached the time for membership as soon as possible to join the UN organizations.</p>
<h3>The Current UN General Assembly is Closely Related to the Far East, and the US May Raise Issues Such as Korea for Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] Diplomatic sources here predict that the current UN General Assembly will be more important to the people of the Far East than last year's General Assembly. Important topics currently on the agenda focus on European and Middle Eastern events, but according to the opinions of test diplomats, many believe that before the end of the General Assembly, several matters closely related to the Far East will be raised. These matters involve Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and may even include Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 13th] According to authoritative sources today, the United States is very likely to suggest that the Korean issue be submitted to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly for discussion. According to people close to the US delegation who told Central News Agency reporters this morning, we can say that the Jiang delegation is currently considering whether it is possible to first propose to include the Korean issue on the agenda of matters that have already been fully submitted for discussion.</p>
<h3>Strict Security at the UN General Assembly Venue</h3>
<p>[United Press Flushing, New York, 14th] Due to the recent three demonstrations that shocked the Security Council, the United Nations hired special guards on the 14th and summoned the New York City Police to provide strict protection for the United Nations General Assembly. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the secret agents of the British Police General Alliance will closely protect the representatives of various countries. Among them, at least ten delegations, including the five Arab delegations, will reportedly dispatch special guards to protect them. The representatives of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia will bring their own guards.</p>
<h3>Lai Speaks and Reviews the World Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press Baltimore, 14th] United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi delivered a speech at the Maryland United Nations Association banquet today, entitled "A Personal Review of the World Situation." It is said that the liberation movement of various nations in the former colonies may pose a greater threat to world peace than disputes between major countries. The failure to conclude peace treaties on weekdays has hindered the work of UN organizations and delayed the world's economic recovery. Major countries are significantly closer to each other than in 1920 to 1930. Some issues are being replaced by the national liberation movements of former colonies, which may cause major conflicts. So far, purely military disputes have been rare, at least not in the form of open warfare. He hopes that the next meeting of foreign ministers will make positive progress on the peace treaty. The so-called failure of UN organizations is not so much a failure of UN organizations themselves as it is a failure of countries to live in harmony. If you carefully analyze the situation, you will find that every negotiation and every meeting has made some progress in mutual understanding between countries.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Various Countries Gather in New York</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 13th] According to estimates by the United Nations Headquarters, nearly a thousand representatives from various countries attending the second UN General Assembly have arrived here, and it is expected that another 1,800 representatives and consultants will arrive here before the 16th. French Prime Minister Lai Madi will arrive within 48 hours, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will arrive after the 16th.</p>
<h3>The French-Occupied Zone of Germany Must Be Merged with the British and American Zones</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 13th] "The World Daily," which reflects the views of the French Foreign Ministry, stated today that the merger of the French military zone in Germany with the British and American zones is inevitable, so it is very likely that Germany will be divided into two major zones, east and west. However, France will not decide the future of the French military zone in Germany before the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is held in London in November. "The World Daily" pointed out that the French military zone has a population of 6 million, while the British and American zones have a population of 40 million, so the French military zone cannot be separated from the British and American zones.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Celebrates Tank Day</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcast that today is Tank Day, and Soviet Defense Minister Bulganin ordered the capitals of the Soviet republics to fire 20 artillery salvos on the 14th to celebrate. Mr. Bulganin also called on workers in tank factories to concentrate their efforts and awareness to gloriously complete the work assigned by Comrade Stalin in order to enhance the strength of the armed mechanized army.</p>
<h3>The British Military Delegation to Hungary is Scheduled to End Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters Budapest, 14th] It was announced here last night that the British military delegation to Hungary will end on September 15, indicating that the United Kingdom has decided to fulfill its decision to withdraw from Hungary immediately on the day of the approval of the Hungarian peace treaty.</p>
<h3>American Aid to Europe Unlikely to be Advanced; Hope for Special Congressional Session Dwindles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Hopes for an early special session of the U.S. Congress to vote on an emergency interim aid package for Europe suddenly dwindled today. Three developments indicate that Secretary of State Marshall and his experts' plans for early aid to Europe do not have the full support of Congress or other parts of the Cabinet:</p>
<p>(1) Accompanying reporters on President Truman's flagship, the USS "Missouri," returning from South America, all stated that the President had not changed his opinion expressed at a press conference before his trip to Brazil, namely that "there is currently no sufficient reason to convene members of the Senate and House of Representatives from their recess to return to Washington;" (2) A responsible source close to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also stated that Vandenberg was very pessimistic about the possibility of convening a special session of Congress; (3) Several respected members of Congress agreed with President Truman's assertion that there was no need to convene a special session of Congress. Senator Millikin of Colorado, a Republican financial authority, declined to express support for the idea of ​​calling a special session. Senate Republican Leader Lucas and several other Democratic senators also expressed similar views. The high hopes of European countries' diplomatic representatives in the U.S., after hearing Marshall strongly advocate for early aid due to the grave and urgent situation in Europe last week, have plummeted due to the clear conclusions drawn from the aforementioned reports.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] It was learned today that government officials will await President Truman's return to Washington on the 20th before detailing the facts to explain the extent of the European economic crisis, so that the President can consider whether the situation is serious and promptly decide within a few days whether there is reason to convene a special session of Congress.</p>
<h3>France and Italy Form Joint Committee to Discuss Customs Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] France and Italy signed a declaration at the French Foreign Ministry today expressing their willingness to begin studying the possibility of establishing a Franco-Italian customs union. The two sides have appointed a joint committee to conduct the study and submit a report to their respective governments before the end of the year. The declaration was signed by French Foreign Minister Bidault and the head of the Italian delegation to the European Economic Conference, Campilli, on behalf of their respective governments. The joint committee will also study the possibility of France and Italy joining a European customs union.</p>
<h3>U.S. Considers Making All Military Forces Available for Dispatch by UN Agencies in Effort to Restore the Agency's Reputation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] It is reported that the United States is considering making its entire army, navy, and air force available for dispatch by UN agencies to restore peace and security in troubled areas around the world, including Greece, Palestine, and Indonesia. This plan is part of the overall strategy of the U.S. delegation at the current UN General Assembly. Secretary of State Marshall briefly explained this plan to the Cabinet and the U.S. delegation to the UN General Assembly in Washington today. Observers believe that the reputation of the UN agency depends on this General Assembly session. The startling nature of this U.S. military plan clearly indicates that the United States is prepared to use its full force to restore the reputation of the UN agency, if necessary, at the cost of the lives of the American people to restore the reputation and position of the UN agency.</p>
<h3>U.S. Establishes Radar Station in Greenland; Danish Government Confirms</h3>
<p>[United Press, Copenhagen, 13th] Official confirmation has been obtained today regarding the establishment of a test station of unknown purpose by the U.S. military within Danish territory. According to Greenland Affairs Minister Oldenburg, he told reporters that he had received reports similar to those in the communist newspapers stating that the United States had established a radar station in Greenland in an attempt to bolster U.S. air defenses. To date, the U.S. side has not notified the Danish government of its activities, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will investigate whether this action violates the 1941 Danish agreement.</p>
<h3>South Slavs Detain British and American Soldiers; Britain and the U.S. Lodging Strong Protests</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: The British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Peake, has lodged a note with the Yugoslav government strongly protesting the illegal detention and mistreatment of active British and American military personnel by the South Slav authorities on the Italo-Yugoslav border. The United States also lodged a strong protest with the South Slav Foreign Ministry on Thursday night regarding the same incident.</p>
<h3>Italian Left-Wing Parties Encourage General Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 13th] Italian labor leaders have ordered 850,000 metalworkers to strike starting on the 15th, as part of a movement to force the Gasperi government to resign. If the strike is implemented, it will paralyze the heavy industries of Milan, Turin, and Terni. Over one million farmers and 200,000 other workers are also on strike. The strike echoes the communist parties' second motion of no confidence in the current government, submitted to the National Assembly within three days.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Involvement in Iranian Oil Dispute; Iran in Extremely Difficult Position; Iran May Ultimately Be Forced to Make Concessions to the Soviets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah declared: The rumors that the British Ambassador to Iran, Sir Reader Bullard, advised the Iranian government to keep the door open for negotiations even if the Iranian Parliament rejected the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement are completely unfounded. Sultanah said that Ambassador Bullard had strongly stated that Britain firmly opposes interference in Iranian affairs, especially regarding oil rights.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: Britain and the United States share the same basic objective in Iran, namely to maintain the country's territorial integrity. The methods of British and American policy may differ, but the goal is the same. The spokesman also denied reports that the United States had protested to Britain about British Ambassador Bullard's advice to the Iranian government to keep the door open for negotiations after the Iranian Parliament rejected the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement signed in April 1946. Dispatches from Washington stated that the United States hoped Iran could adopt a firmer policy and believed that the British ambassador's advice to the Iranian government was out of fear that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's oil rights in Iran would also be revoked if the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was rejected.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Diplomatic observers say Iran will sooner or later make concessions to the Soviet Union on oil and political issues. London believes that Iran's inability to permanently adopt an unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union is a foregone conclusion. Well-informed diplomatic sources say that if the Soviet Union cannot obtain economic concessions from Iran, it may take military and political steps, so Britain is prepared to consider economic concessions.</p>
<h3>American Church Leader Predicts Communist Party Will Fail</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Dr. Cadman, a leader of the American Council of Churches, stated in a formal report to Secretary of the Army Royall that he had the impression from his travels in Europe this summer that the Soviet Union's desire to gradually encompass Europe and the world would ultimately destroy the Communist Party. Cadman said: "Everyone is holding their breath waiting for the first shot in the final conflict between the communist aggressors and the democratic countries, and the U.S. military is no exception. The Soviet Union is currently obstructing the construction of Europe and creating chaos, hoping to create a 'revolutionary environment.' The oppressed people of Europe know that the Soviet Union is the root cause of their suffering and may rise up to overthrow the communists. Even if the people do not rise up and resist, God will avenge them." Royall had sent fourteen clergymen to Europe for observation, and this was the fourth report he received.</p>
<h3>Fire at Japanese Finance Ministry Destroys Important Documents</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] A major fire broke out at the Ministry of Finance building last night, destroying the building and important documents such as the budget proposal, but there were no casualties. More than 30 fire trucks rushed to the scene to provide assistance, and Finance Minister Kurusu also personally visited the fire site. According to the police department, the fire may have been caused by excessive heat from an electric stove. "Tokyo Shimbun" quoted neighbors and junior officials of the Ministry of Finance as saying that officials often drank and made merry after meetings, and that this carelessness was self-inflicted.</p>
<h3>Doihara and Other War Criminals Refuse to Testify</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] A person returning from the International War Crimes Tribunal told our reporter that Kenji Doihara, the famous Japanese spy (the "Lawrence of Manchuria"), and sixteen other Class A war criminals, are expected to refuse to testify, as they fear that their testimonies may be flawed under rigorous questioning.</p>
<h3>China Will Continue to Send Military and Political Officials to Assist Chiang Chia-tung's Investigation; The Netherlands is Willing to Provide Chiang with All Kinds of Convenience</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 13th] The Dutch Embassy in Nanjing announced today: The Dutch government has informed the Chinese government that it is willing to provide any convenience to Chiang Chia-tung, the Chinese Consul-General in Batavia, so that he can conduct investigations into the implementation of the ceasefire order as a member of the consular corps, in accordance with the resolution of the Security Council. China will continue to send military and political officials to assist Chiang's investigation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 13th] Our Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung and the Belgian Consul-General returned this morning from an aerial trip to Tjiseuk Maraja, about 100 kilometers southeast of Kolontong. It is said that the situation around the area is not peaceful. The Indonesian army burned two houses during the few hours they occupied the area. On their way back, they landed in Bandung and then took a car from there to Tjiwidej and Pengalengan, 40 kilometers south of Bandung.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Reconvenes Today; Katayama Faces Difficulties; Opposition Party Attempts to Seize Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Social Democratic Cabinet led by Katayama will face what Japanese politicians regard as the most serious test since its establishment when the Japanese Parliament reconvenes today. After the parliament reconvenes, there are still many unresolved and highly contentious issues on its agenda, giving the lone opposition party, the Liberal Party, an opportunity to overthrow the Katayama Cabinet. Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party and former prime minister, recently said in a speech in Hokkaido that the current coalition cabinet is "a mixed family of monkeys in hats."</p>
<p>When Katayama and Nishio hosted domestic and foreign journalists yesterday, they strongly asserted that the current cabinet is fully qualified to represent Japan in the upcoming peace conference, and therefore there is no need for any cabinet changes. According to the English-language Japan Times' prediction on the 14th: "The Katayama Cabinet will encounter major difficulties during the upcoming parliamentary session due to strong opposition from non-government parties attempting to control important legislation." All of this legislation is focused on the Japanese economic reconstruction plan, including the nationalization of coal mines, budget subsidies, and the distribution of industrial and commercial enterprises to oppose monopolies. Of the current 466 members of the House of Representatives, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party, which support the Katayama Cabinet, account for more than 270 seats, while the opposition Liberal Party accounts for 123 seats. It has recently been repeatedly rumored that Yoshida and others are attempting to form another powerful conservative opposition party in order to lay the foundation for overthrowing Katayama and reorganizing a powerful and unified cabinet that is more fully qualified to represent Japan at the peace conference.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session; Hah Wen (Continued from above) (Second Edition)</h3>
<p>(3) Operational achievements in the past six months: (A) Strategic achievements: (1) The bandits originally planned to copy the National Army's strategy of resisting Japan, attempting to win by exhaustion and attrition. The National Army had already seen through their plot. After repeated suppression campaigns, the bandits lost Yan'an and then Central Shandong in the past six months. Their occupied areas are shrinking daily, especially with the depletion of troops and the lack of resources. With the military setbacks, they are trapped in poor and crowded mountainous areas, and it is difficult for military production to supply the consumption of large armies. It is absolutely difficult to compensate for their long-term losses in manpower replenishment. The objective conditions for the so-called protracted war have been eliminated. (2) The bandits' base areas have been repeatedly destroyed, and most of their elite troops have been lost. The morale of the army is declining day by day. Chen Yi, the bandit leader, is known to be strong, and the soldiers of Qi and Lu are known to be brave. They had been operating in the Yimeng Mountain area for ten years, with deep roots. However, when the National Army launched a suppression campaign, they first occupied Linyi and repeatedly defeated Nanma and Linqu. Their base area was destroyed, and the number of people who surrendered and returned increased daily. The bandits have always regarded materialism as their doctrine, and their military thinking is also materialistic. Now, after being hit by this factual blow, the spiritual conditions for their protracted war have been lost. (3) The bandits' external sources have been cut off. Since the rapid recovery of the Central Plains Military Region, the bandits' supply has become increasingly difficult. They can only rely on the Liaodong Peninsula as the only supply route to the interior. Their military supplies often depend on this. Now that we have recovered Shandong and are advancing into Jiaodong, intending to cut off their external aid, the source of supply will be cut off, which is also a clear sign that the bandits' final doomsday is approaching. (4) Yan'an was the bandits' political center and the location for issuing orders. After the National Army recovered it, their leadership was lost, and morale was obviously shaken. (5) Ensuring the results of the victory in the War of Resistance. The purpose of our War of Resistance was entirely to recover sovereignty over the Northeast. The communist bandits colluded with foreign forces, originally attempting to take advantage of the War of Resistance to reap the benefits of others' labor. When the National Army took over, the bandits were very disappointed, so they did not hesitate to cross the river five times to invade, but they were all defeated by our army. The recent Battle of Siping was a particularly severe blow. Ensuring sovereignty over the Northeast is not only what the people of the whole country hope for, but also where the lifeline of the country lies. In the operations of the past six months, the bandits concentrated their forces and colluded with Korean and Mongolian bandits, but they were still helpless, which is also one of our strategic gains. (B) Cities and towns recovered, transportation lines, and the number of communist bandits captured, wounded, and killed: The above describes the bandits' strategic losses, which are also spiritual defects that cannot be compensated for. Now, the material losses are briefly listed as follows: (1) 117 cities and towns were recovered, covering an area of ​​approximately 228,778 square kilometers. (2) 950,893 bandits were killed or wounded, 92,336 were captured, and 52,504 bandits surrendered. (3) Major transportation lines recovered include the middle section of the Longhai Line, the Beining Line, the northern section of the Pinghan Line, the PingSui Line, the Jiaoji Line, the Zhongchang Line and its branches, and the Jinre Line. The communist bandits destroyed 3,164 kilometers, and 1,826 kilometers have now been repaired and opened to traffic. (4) The situation of the National Army's progress in suppressing the bandits in the past six months is compared as shown in the attached figure. (C) The above describes the losses of the bandit army. As for the casualties of the National Army in the past six months, they were 346,537, with greater losses in the Shandong battlefield.</p>
<p>E. Conclusion</p>
<p>The policy guidelines of this Ministry for the 36th year of the Republic were originally to continue the reorganization and demobilization of the army as the biggest goal, and they are being gradually implemented according to plan. Now the communist bandits are intensifying their military expansion and expanding the rebellion, and are even leading Korean and Mongolian communist bandits and Japanese prisoners of war into the Northeast, with weapons supplied by a certain party, to attack the National Army. They have also colluded with Outer Mongolia and blatantly encroached on the Western borders. Half of the country is being destroyed horizontally. Wherever the bandits go, they destroy factories, railways, river dikes, and mining areas, trying to completely destroy the country's vitality and the national economy. They slaughter the innocent and do everything to the extreme. All the cruel acts that foreign enemies cannot bear to do, the communists can do willingly and without scruples, causing the people to suffer deeply and the fate of the country to be shaken. The government, with its responsibilities, had no choice but to resolve to quell the chaos and remove the obstacles to national construction in order to protect the country's foundation and the people's lives. As long as the communist bandits exist for one day, the country's peace, social order, and people's lives will be harmed for one day, and the country's finances and the national economy will be destroyed. National construction and army building cannot be started. Looking at the overall situation of the world, the conflicts between countries due to boundary concepts, economic interests, and conflicts of ideas are becoming increasingly sharp. It is not possible to guarantee peace with empty words. In view of the serious losses and tragic sacrifices of the eight-year War of Resistance, we should have a deeper understanding and more adequate preparation for national defense in the future in order to protect our country's independence, freedom, and security. The great cause of national construction and army building must be completed with a unified situation and a considerable amount of time for preparation and implementation. If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, the country will not only be unable to unify, but will also directly invite foreign disasters. National construction and army building cannot be implemented. Therefore, to build the country and build the army, we must first eliminate the communist bandits, otherwise the country's future and the nation's destiny will be unimaginable. This is indeed the primary national policy for the country to overcome its difficulties and move towards prosperity and strength. (End)</p>

<h3>Adjust Tax Revenue, Solve Housing Shortage; Inventory and Valuation of Building Improvements; Old French Concession Area to be Handled First This Year</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The land general registration and land valuation in the four districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Hubei South, and Fahua in the central area of ​​this city have been carried out in order. However, the valuation and registration of building improvements (houses) could not be carried out at the same time due to time, manpower, material resources, and other limitations. Although the former Bureau of Public Works had investigated a part of the houses in the old public concession area, most of the existing data is incomplete. The Municipal Finance Bureau had once planned to investigate the old French concession area, but it was not realized. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable basis for adjusting tax revenue and solving the housing shortage, which has a great impact on municipal construction. For this reason, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau intends to conduct a general survey and valuation of building improvements in the above-mentioned areas in order to understand the status of building improvements, the situation of convenient use, and their current value, as the basis for adjusting tax revenue and solving the housing shortage. Also, because the past cadastral and household registration systems have not been linked, it is very inconvenient for general administrative facilities. It is also planned to pay attention to the numbering of households and land in this survey to facilitate verification. This work is scheduled to be completed within one year. The old French Concession area will be handled first this year, and then it will be extended to other areas in the future.</p>
<p>Once Approved, It Can Be Started</p>
<p>The Land Administration Bureau has now drafted a plan for conducting a survey and valuation of building improvements in the old French Concession area and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, the work can be started. The entire old French Concession area is calculated as one household per single room, one building (apartments, office buildings, residences, factories, and other large buildings are calculated proportionally), totaling approximately 48,000 households. The work process is divided into nine items: (1) Survey: In accordance with the land section, household-by-household surveys are conducted on the area of ​​the construction land, the area or volume of the building, the structure, the types of materials, the cost, the equipment, the owner of the land and buildings, the name of the user, the numbering of the land number and household registration number, and the general situation of its use, etc. A flat sketch is measured and drawn at any time, and a survey form is filled out as the basis for assessment.</p>
<p>If There is Discrepancy, Re-check at Any Time</p>
<p>(2) Drawing and Calculation: (A) Before the implementation of the survey, a fish scale map will be copied for use in the actual survey of sections. (B) According to the survey and mapping sketch, a 1/500 or 1/600 building plan sub-map will be drawn, and at the same time, the cadastral number will be checked, and a sub-map will be drawn. If there is any discrepancy, it must be re-checked at any time. After the re-check is completed, it will be handled according to the re-check results. (3) Assessment: (A) Collect the construction material sales index of building improvements over the years, the service life (depreciation rate) of various buildings, and the residual value of buildings after they are discarded, etc. (B) Based on the survey chart and the collected data, the current value will be meticulously assessed. If there is any doubt, a re-check will be conducted. (C) After the assessment is completed, each item will be numbered (it should be coordinated with the household land map).</p>
<p>Assessment Completed, Public Announcement Notification</p>
<p>(4) Re-check: If there is any doubt about the survey results or assessment, or if there is any discrepancy in the household land, or if the owner raises an objection, a staff member will be dispatched to re-check it in order to ensure accuracy. (5) Publication and Notification: After the assessment of each section of building improvements is completed, it will be published and notified in accordance with the law. (6) Evaluation: If the owner raises an objection after publication and notification, it will be evaluated by the Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee. (7) Registration: After publication and notification, if the owner has not raised an objection, or if the objection has been raised and the Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee has evaluated it, it will be the statutory value. A list of building improvement prices will be compiled, and at the same time, it will be compiled into the land registration book and the land price book.</p>
<h3>Pleasant Weather Attracts Many Travelers; Railway Bureau Decides to Add Express Trains</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been pleasant, which is suitable for travel. Passengers on the Jinghu and Huhang lines are crowded again. The West Lake tourist train is especially in short supply. The total number of passengers getting on and off at the North Station Terminal in this city averages more than 40,000 per day. The Railway Bureau has decided to add two express trains between Shanghai and Wuxi and Shanghai and Hangzhou starting from October 1. At the same time, it is also considering adding one train in Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The running time of each train on the two lines will also be re-adjusted. It is currently being compiled by the Transportation Department.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Bureau Restoration Anniversary</h3>

<h3>Seeking Revenge; Dancer Disfigured; Acid Thrown, Old Zhengxing a Scene of Groans; Old Grudge Not Resolved, Jin Lina Suffers Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jin Lina (original name Du Juying, see Gang), a 24-year-old dancer at the Dahu Ballroom, is from Changzhou. She met a dancer named Lu Tingfang, 31 years old, in March this spring. They fell in love over time and finally lived together in the Longgong Hotel. However, Lu had no proper occupation and gradually squandered all of the woman's private savings. The woman, in a difficult situation, agreed to divorce, which happened in June of this year. At that time, the woman paid the man 4.3 million yuan in one lump sum, stating that they would not have any contact from then on.</p>
<p>After the divorce, the woman returned to the Dahu Ballroom and went back to sea. Lu still harassed her from time to time. On July 12, he took advantage of Jin's return home from dancing at night and attempted to harm her with acid in the Central Apartment on Jinling Road, but he did not achieve his purpose. Lu himself was arrested for being injured instead. Since then, Lu has harbored even more resentment. At about 7 o'clock last night, Lu learned that Jin and another dancer, Wu Lanfang, and four dancers were having dinner at the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Sanma Road, so he rushed there with a bottle of acid. When Jin was talking and laughing with the dancers, she was splashed with acid all over her face. The dancers at the scene rose up to block him, so they were also splashed with acid. Lu Tingfang panicked and injured his own head and hands.</p>
<p>The murderer was eventually caught by the dancers at the scene. At that time, groans were heard all over the second floor. During the confusion, in addition to Jin Lina's serious injuries to her face, another dancer, Wu Lanfang, and dancers Zhang Zhenyuan, Chen Jiangang, Wang Yongfu, Wang Yiming, and the waiter Zhu Chunhai were also burned, either on their faces or on their hands. After the incident, the owner of Lao Zhengxing reported to the police. The injured were first sent to Renji Hospital. Except for Jin, who was hospitalized due to her serious injuries, the rest of the people were taken to the Lao Zha Police Station to testify after being bandaged. The murderer has been detained by the police station for interrogation.</p>

<h3>His Conduct Far Surpassed Hu Anguo; His Life Was Similar to Gu Ningren; Memorial for Hu Puan; Over Five Hundred People from All Circles Attended; Speaker Pan Presided Over the Ceremony and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Master of Classical Learning Mr. Hu Puan was held yesterday at 3 PM at the Jing'an Temple on Nanjing West Road, Shanghai. Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Examination Yuan President Dai Chuanxian, Control Yuan President Yu Youren, and Mr. Liu Yazi, among others, all sent elegies. Leaders from all circles of the city's party, government, and culture also came to express their condolences. The Jing'an Temple was filled with hundreds of white paper scrolls with elegiac couplets written in ink, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. More than 500 people attended the memorial service, including Mr. Hu's friends during his lifetime, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Feng Youzhen, Zhai Yifu, Xu Weinan, Zhang Yi, and Hu's relatives, friends, and disciples. At 3 PM, the memorial ceremony began. Mr. Pan Gongzhan presided over the ceremony. After playing mourning music, the presiding officer offered incense and flowers, and presented libations. Then, representatives from the National University Alumni Association, the Chih Tze University Alumni Association, and the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association read memorial orations successively. All the mourners bowed three times to Mr. Hu's portrait. Mr. Pan Gongzhan first delivered a speech, stating that Mr. Hu Puan's character, learning, morality, thought, belief, and spirit were all worthy of the highest respect. Mr. Hu devoted himself to writing behind closed doors during the period when Shanghai was occupied, and his strong national consciousness and national concept, and his noble integrity and spirit, could not be achieved by those without cultivation. Therefore, Mr. Hu's greatness lies not only in his scholarship but also in his personality. Mr. Hu's expectations for young people were particularly earnest. He once said, "I hope that our young people will not be ancient Chinese, nor will they be modern foreigners." Although only a few words, the meaning is profound and can indeed serve as an indicator for our young people. Therefore, when we remember Mr. Hu today, we should inherit his immortal spirit and make it shine brightly. Afterwards, Mr. Zhai Yifu reported on Mr. Hu's life story, and Mr. Yan Duhe delivered a speech on behalf of the guests. Finally, after the Hu family expressed their gratitude, the memorial ceremony concluded in mourning music.</p>
<p>When the memorial service was held yesterday, there were many elegiac couplets from all walks of life. Mayor Wu Guozhen's elegiac couplet read: "Accumulating morality and capable of writing, his longstanding reputation weighs heavily in the Southeast; his conduct far surpasses Hu Anguo; encouraging Confucianism and valuing integrity, his high name will last throughout the universe; his life was similar to Gu Ningren."</p>
<h3>Li Ximou's Broadcast: Today's Education in Shanghai; Cultural Construction is a Manifestation of National Spirit; Hoping that Education Funding Can Be Appropriately Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This newspaper held the 24th Sunday Special Broadcast at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station yesterday, inviting Acting Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou to broadcast on "Today's Education in Shanghai." The main points of his speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>The education in our city was severely damaged by the enemy and puppet regime during the period of occupation. At the beginning of the victory, the work done was restoration work. Not only did we have to remedy the past defects in material terms, but we also had to have new achievements in spiritual terms. Last year, we began to enter the stage of consolidation. Speaking of today's education in Shanghai, it can be divided into three categories: (1) secondary education, (2) national education, and (3) social education. In terms of secondary education, there are also higher vocational schools. There are currently three municipal vocational schools: A, Industrial Vocational School, which is divided into civil engineering, mechanical, and electrical engineering departments; B, Normal Vocational School, which trains teachers for primary and junior high schools; C, Physical Education Vocational School.</p>
<p>Preparing to Establish an Aquatic Vocational School</p>
<p>In addition, the municipal authorities are preparing to establish an aquatic vocational school because Shanghai has superior conditions for aquaculture and fisheries. The Executive Yuan Fisheries Administration Office, the Shanghai Fish Market, and the China Aquatic Products Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are all concentrated in talent, making it very convenient to hold. The Education Bureau has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for its establishment. There are sixteen municipal secondary schools and two hundred and sixty-seven private secondary schools. In terms of the number of students, municipal schools account for one-third, and private schools account for two-thirds. This is because although the number of municipal schools is small, the scale is larger, while the number of private schools is large, but the school buildings are smaller and can accommodate fewer students. There are more than two hundred and sixty municipal national schools and more than nine hundred private schools. The number of students in municipal schools is about 110,000, and the number of students in private schools is about 250,000, which is also a ratio of one to two. Judging from the above situation, private secondary schools and national schools have fulfilled considerable responsibilities for education in Shanghai. Without the existence of so many private schools, the problem of dropping out of school would be more serious.</p>
<p>Social Education Prioritizes Literacy</p>
<p>As for the difficulties in running schools, the funding is insufficient, the teachers' salaries are too low, which is lower than those of employees in the industrial and commercial sectors, and the equipment is inadequate. All physics and chemistry experimental equipment is missing, or although a few schools such as Gezhi and Yucai have better equipment, the equipment is old and needs to be supplemented and added. As for social education, the important issue is literacy. The Education Bureau has held more than 120 people's schools, ranging from three classes to five or six classes per school. However, I feel a little difficulty, that is, the number of people is very large when school starts, and then it gradually decreases, because most of the people who come to people's schools to study are adults. They have to work during the day to make a living, and they feel tired after a long time. How to improve their interest so that they can follow through to the end is an urgent issue for public education.</p>
<p>Funding is the Biggest Difficulty</p>
<p>As for public education centers, libraries, museums, art galleries, etc., they are necessary cultural constructions for a big city. Shanghai is the largest city in China. Foreigners come to China and take the first step into Shanghai. If they only see tall buildings but not national culture and art, wouldn't it be a shame for the people of Shanghai? Therefore, the municipal authorities plan to devote themselves to the cultural construction of Shanghai in the next few years. However, the biggest difficult problem in China today is the economic problem. The city's education expenses account for 20% of the city's budget. The number is not too small, but at a time when prices are high, it is still not enough. It is hoped that after the constitution is implemented in the future, education expenses can be appropriately increased. Cultural construction is a manifestation of national spirit, and the Municipal Education Bureau will do its best to make Shanghai not only the economic and industrial center of the country, but also the cultural and educational center of the country.</p>

<h3>Former Manager of the Savings and Remittance Bureau Accused of Embezzlement Reaching 100 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, was previously secretly reported to have falsely used account names to privately release exchange mortgages for profit, with embezzlement reaching 100 billion yuan. The case is currently under thorough investigation by the judicial authorities.</p>
<h3>Improved Cotton Seed Results: Taicang Area is the Best; Cotton Plants Can Be as Tall as a Person; Cotton Bolls are Solid and Plentiful</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry yesterday hosted various circles in Shanghai to visit the American cotton promotion work done by the office in the counties near Shanghai. More than 30 people attended, including Mr. Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager, Mr. Doug, Agricultural Attache of the American Embassy, representatives of major yarn factories, and reporters from various newspapers. Around 9 AM in the morning, Director Hu Jingliang of the office took the bus together. Due to time constraints, only the main promotion areas of Jiangwan, Dachang, Zhenru, and Taicang were visited. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and also took a special train to Taicang to participate in the inspection.</p>
<p>This year, the Cotton Production Improvement Office promoted cotton in the areas near Shanghai, including Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Taicang, Baoshan, Shanghai City, Changshu, Jiading, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Shanghai County, and Songjiang, totaling 12 counties and cities. Among them, Shanghai City, Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Fengxian, and Nanhui had the largest promotion area. The total promotion area in the entire area reached 64,991.4 mu.</p>
<p>There are three types of American cotton varieties promoted: Texas Cotton No. 531, Cole Cotton Hundred Series No. 1, and Dai Cotton. Farmers in Shanghai and Taicang areas used to grow Chinese cotton, which has short and coarse fibers and can only spin coarse yarns below 12 counts, and the yield is low. The yield of seed cotton per mu of cotton field is only about 100 jin. American cotton has large cotton bolls, long and abundant lint. The best-growing cotton field in this area is estimated to have a yield of seed cotton of up to 200 jin per mu. The ginning outturn is estimated to be from 32% to 40%.</p>
<p>Registering Cotton Fields; Issuing Seeds on Loan</p>
<p>According to the report of the Cotton Production Improvement Office: The implementation process of the office's promotion work: (1) Conducting cotton field registration, which was completed before the end of March. (2) Issuing seeds on loan: Each cotton farmer is lent 8 jin of seeds for each mu of cotton planted. This work was completed at the end of April. (3) Guiding sowing, thinning, and setting seedlings: Sowing started successively at the end of April, and the work above the thinning stage was completed at the end of May. Seedling setting work was carried out in early June. (4) Guiding mid-cultivation and weeding: The first work was carried out in May, and the second, third, and fourth works were carried out in June and July. (5) Setting up cotton seed management areas, actively managing cotton seeds. A cotton seed management area must be set up for all promotion cotton fields with more than 500 mu to maintain pure seeds for promotion next year. (6) Preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. In the early seedling stage of cotton this year, a small number of aphids occurred. After autumn, leaf roller insects occurred again, and medicines and machinery were used to eliminate them with all efforts.</p>
<p>Farmers Bank Providing Loans</p>
<p>In order to solve the various production expenses required by cotton farmers when planting cotton, the office specially negotiated with the China Farmers Bank to provide production and in-kind loans. A loan of 15,000 yuan is given for each mu of cotton planted, which is collected by cotton farmer organizations such as cooperatives, farmers' associations, or association. Regarding the in-kind loan, there are three types of bean cake, ammonium nitrate, and calcium phosphate. The total amount of loans is approximately 2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's visit to the districts showed that the Taicang area is a demonstration area, so the improved cotton varieties planted have excellent results. The cotton plants can be as tall as a person, and the distance between each plant is moderate. The cotton bolls produced by each plant are particularly abundant and spectacular. Compared with the Chinese cotton planted next to it, the difference is obvious. The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association specially set up a cotton breeding field in Zhenru, which has two-row trials, five-row trials, ten-row trials, and breeding areas of Texas cotton, etc., and the results are also not weak. According to the survey, the total output of lint cotton from American cotton in the first cotton production figures in various counties and cities in Shanghai this year is approximately more than 20,000 dan.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Army's Recruitment Exam Confirmed; Female Heroes Travel Together Across the River</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Peng Bolun of the Fifth Army's Information Office and 27 female political workers recruited in Shanghai and Hangzhou left Nanjing at about 5 AM on the 14th and crossed the river to Pukou to go to Xuzhou. They arrived in Nanjing on the 13th. After strict inquiries by the military police, they were deemed suspicious and were temporarily detained at the Dahua Hotel in Xiaguan. Later, after the military police inquired about the facts from Shanghai and Xuzhou, they learned that the recruitment of political workers was indeed the case. However, the procedures were not fully completed when they left Shanghai, which led to misunderstandings. After the military police learned the truth, they were allowed to leave for Xuzhou that day. The Information Office of the army had also set up a recruitment agency in Nanjing, but it had taken the recruited female personnel to Xuzhou a few days ago.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Warehouse Fire Suspicious</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At about 7 AM yesterday morning, thick smoke suddenly billowed from the Central Trust Bureau warehouse office on the fifth floor of the Baomei Foreign Company at the intersection of Dongda Ming Road and Gaoyang Road. Fortunately, the gatekeeper Li Hanbin discovered it and urgently called the fire department to send a car to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished at 8:10 AM. The loss of miscellaneous items was still light. However, the Yangshupu Police Sub-Bureau believed that no one was originally on duty on the fifth floor, and the carelessness was suspicious. The gatekeeper was taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Cargo Ship Catches Fire at Pudong Merchants Wharf</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cargo ship No. 105, which was docked at the fourth quay of the Pudong Merchants Bureau, caught fire at about 1 AM yesterday morning. The cargo in the cabin was mostly miscellaneous goods. It took two hours to extinguish the fire, and the loss was still light.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Host Christian Education Representatives; A Record of Inspecting the Exhibition Venue</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] In order to educate the next generation and popularize scientific culture, the United Nations Far East Regional Fundamental Education Research Conference was held in Nanjing for ten days. After exchanging information on the implementation of fundamental education in various countries, it was determined that education has supreme potential for international cultural communication; representatives from Australia, India, Myanmar, Egypt, and Nepal, who came from afar, arrived in Shanghai last night to stay for one and a half days to visit the city's fundamental education institutions. The Municipal Government Education Bureau and the education and cultural circles had established a reception committee several weeks ago to prepare for the reception. Yesterday, various exhibitions and performances were arranged. The reception committee specially invited relevant parties to inspect the exhibition venues for the final beautification.</p>
<p>At 9 AM, more than 20 reception committee members, including Acting Director Li, Director Zhu Junti, Chen Yunqin, Huang Renjian, Hu Shuyi, Shu Xincheng, and Lu Guanliu, gathered at Wanzhu Primary School in Luxiang Garden, Nanshi, to appreciate the achievements of children's labor and art in the large classroom at the west end of the spacious playground. The four walls were covered with watercolor paintings, charcoal paintings, carvings, embroidery, etc. made by elementary school students. The tables were full of agricultural tools, furniture, textile machines, and transportation vehicles, from wooden plows, benches, hand-cranked spinning wheels, and wheelbarrows from the "primitive" era to threshing machines, sofas, spindle iron spinning wheels, trains, steamers, and airplanes from the "atomic" era, showing the daily renewal of science and the monthly change of culture. The most eye-catching thing in the room was the three-dimensional model of the ideal Pujiang Iron Bridge. The bridge was crowded with vehicles, and the river surface was full of boats. It really met the ideal. The plan to build a bridge across the river is a model in the design</p>
<h3>Teaching Aids</h3>
<p>Two "Language Subject Spoken Composition Achievement Rooms" display literacy tools, such as square characters, phonetic symbol usage, new word card boxes, public literacy signs, pronunciation illustrations, etc., which are simple, eye-catching, and orderly. "Quadrilateral Character Checking Pen Shape and Number Identification Board" in a corner of the room is a new invention. The board is divided into two parts, one for pen shape and one for number. There are electric button holes at the upper end of each pen shape and number, and there are small light bulbs at the rear. To know which number a certain pen shape belongs to, just insert the electric plug in the center of the board into the electric button hole at the upper end of that pen shape, and the number to be found on the number board on the left will be illuminated by the light bulb behind it, which is very convenient. The next room is the "Language Subject Composition Achievement Exhibition." A "Ten-Usage Language Teaching Tool" in the center is another novel teaching aid, invented by Xu Ziling of the 19th District Central National School, to simplify the steps of learning to make sentences and write compositions. Its "ten uses" are: (1) serial stories, (2) jigsaw puzzles, (3) couplet boards, (4) filling sentence boards, (5) homophone flipping boards, (6) contrasting character flipping boards, (7) radical character insertion, (8) adding stroke character insertion, (9) poem riddle character insertion, (10) model character board. "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." To popularize education, there must be more "sharp tools," but the cost of this kind of teaching aid is not small. One piece cannot be done without more than 3 million yuan, which is really not something that our country after eight years of the War of Resistance can mass-produce. In the "Language Subject Writing Achievement Room," the calligraphy exhibition of elementary school students fully demonstrates the talents of some excellent children. Wang characters with iron strokes and silver hooks, Yan characters with dignity and fullness, and Su characters with dragons flying and phoenixes dancing indicate where the artistic traces of the Chinese nation lie.</p>
<p>A Three-and-a-Half-Year-Old Band Conductor</p>
<p>Leaving Wanzhu, the whole group went to the First Central National School in the Fifth District. After inspecting the orange-walled and green-windowed, bright, clean, and quiet building for a week, they hurriedly boarded the bus and drove straight to the Female Normal School Affiliated Primary School on Yuyuan Road to watch a children's music performance. At the stage, more than a dozen girls were performing "Neon Clothes Feather Dress Song." Then came "Rhythm Music." A group of kindergarten students sat in rows, playing bronze instruments following the piano. The little conductor (three and a half years old) holding a baton, actually has the demeanor of a musician. Other programs include chorus, national music, etc.</p>
<h3>The Vast Sea of Chinese Collection</h3>
<p>At noon, the group rushed to the Editorial Department of Zhonghua Book Company to watch the literacy film produced by Shu Xincheng and Jin Zhaozhi, and visit more than 7,400 books on various fundamental education aspects displayed by Zhonghua, including enlightenment, Chinese, writing, arithmetic, common sense, civics, history, geography, etc., more than 30 types, with many titles, it can be said that from astronomy to geography, nothing is not "available." The "Zhonghua" collection room has more than 660,000 books, especially many famous ancient books. They also have the first issue of this newspaper, which was published 75 years ago. In addition, the education toys, animal specimens, and physical and chemical experimental instruments made by the bureau itself are displayed on the fourth floor, which can be regarded as representative works of domestic products, competing with imported products. Finally, Shu Xincheng, the editor-in-chief of Zhonghua, hosted a lunch for the whole group. On the way back, the reporter seemed to see thousands of innocent and happy elementary school children, regardless of wealth or poverty, receiving scientific and progressive education, showing a new China without internal strife, unified, democratic, and strong!</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship; Deadline Approaching; Impoverished Students Urgently Need Assistance; Appealing to All Circles to Give Compassion</h3>
<p>As the days go by, the deadline for the special fundraising for the "Reader Scholarship" is also approaching day by day. The total amount of donations is still a long way from the expected goal. For the sake of countless impoverished students' studies and the future of countless promising young people, we shouted and appealed with all our might, but this cruel society did not give us much sympathy and assistance. Countless students are still eagerly looking forward to assistance and relief.</p>
<p>Providing assistance to a person who is suffering may be more meaningful than praising a person who is in a happy environment! So, dear readers, why don't you give these impoverished young people more practical benefits and more assistance?</p>
<p>The "Reader Scholarship" will close for donations on the 22nd of this month. The short seven days will pass like a meteor. We hope that dear readers can provide urgent assistance to those who need it within the seven days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a donation of 2 million yuan from reader Rao Zhongyang's banquet savings. Other people from Wufu Advertising Company have also put in a lot of effort for us. We would like to thank you here.</p>
<h3>Our First Aid Ship; Jianji, Has Perfect Equipment; A Record of Rescuing the Hai Zhe and a Visit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jianji, the rescue ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was converted from the Min 118. It set off for the first time on August 7 to rescue the Hai Zhe, which ran aground in Jinmen. After being rescued and sent to Keelung for repairs, it returned to Shanghai on the 6th of this month. The round trip took one month, and the results of the initial rescue project were satisfactory. The captain of the ship is Fan Lun, the head of the maritime section of the company's shipping department. Lin Jinxin is the chief mate, both of whom have rich navigation experience. The conversion of rescue equipment was also designed by Captain Fan and supervised by Chief Mate Lin, so all the equipment is complete.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ship hosted reporters to visit. Captain Fan led the boarding and Chief Mate Lin led the tour, explaining everything in detail. The ship has a total tonnage of 800 tons, a diesel engine, a total of 1,200 horsepower, a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour, and can tow a 10,000-ton giant ship. All the equipment is no less than a warship. According to Captain Fan, this rescue ship is the first of its kind in our country. He is very happy with the success of rescuing the Hai Zhe this time. He will continue to add rescue tools to make it a perfect rescue ship. In the future, it will not only be convenient for the company itself, but also happy to assist other companies when ships have maritime accidents.</p>

<h3>Lifting of Grain Restrictions in Hunan – Unimaginable Consequences</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 10th] Hunan is the "granary" of the nation, yet paradoxically, the price of grain has skyrocketed during storage. This rapid price surge has created chaos in the market and widespread anxiety. The common people haven't forgotten that just over a month ago, the highest price for top-quality early rice was only around 100,000 yuan per dan. However, even with the new late rice from the lake region fully on the market and the rest of the region "harvesting in full swing," the price has surged to over 180,000 yuan per dan in the past month. The common people also clearly understand the inside story of this price surge: it's not due to a poor harvest or lack of supply; it's simply that the government shouldn't have "lifted restrictions" and allowed rice merchants from Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangdong to come to Hunan and carry away the yellow, glistening grain that sustains the 30 million people of Hunan.</p>
<p>The Grain Price Surge</p>
<p>began after the resolution to "lift grain restrictions" was passed at the Provincial Government Committee meeting on July 16th. This resolution was passed with the prior consent of the Provincial Senate and adopted a recommendation from the Provincial Education Association: for every dan of grain transported out of the province, a donation of 5,000 yuan would be collected for education to assist in the recovery of education. This measure by the Provincial Government is very "democratic." As for the reasons for passing this resolution, it was stated that: given the current (mid-July) transportation capacity on all lines, the maximum amount of grain transported out of the province each month would not exceed 500,000 dan (referring to unhusked rice), which would total 2.5 million dan in the remaining five months of the year. Furthermore, considering the surplus grain in the province: in a normal year, the yield of staple grains is approximately 120 million dan, and miscellaneous grains are 28 million dan; the actual grain requirement of the province is 115 million dan, leaving a surplus of over 30 million dan; however, this year is a bumper harvest, with an estimated yield of staple grains reaching 150 million dan, which means there is a surplus of over 30 million dan compared to a normal year. Since there is no fear of grain shortage in the province, a "grain famine" is unlikely to occur, and therefore, grain is unlikely to become the target of manipulation or speculation.</p>
<p>Based on this so-called "accurate estimate," Hunan grain was very easily "deregulated"!</p>
<p>On July 21st, the "Grain Export Registration Office" was established in Changsha to handle registration and collection of donations. Inspection points were set up in Changsha, Jinggang, Xiangyin, Lulin Tan, Chenglingji in Yueyang, Zhucikou, Meitianhu, Dianjiaoxu in Huarong, Sanxianhu in Nanxian, Meijingyao in Anxiang, Huangshahe in Siqi Southeast, and Bailing in Yizhang.</p>
<p>The next day, the Provincial Government held a meeting and passed a proposal to allocate 50,000 dan of rice to Guangdong.</p>
<p>From then on, abnormal phenomena gradually unfolded in the Hunan grain market: rice merchants from this province desperately transported grain out, while rice merchants from other provinces poured into the lake region to purchase grain. Especially in the past half-month, an average of about 25,000 dan of grain was transported out daily through registration procedures, and it is unknown how much was smuggled out. As of August 29th, the education donations collected had reached over 3.3 billion yuan. Based on this figure, the amount of grain transported out in the forty days from July 21st to August 29th reached over 700,000 dan. This exceeded the official original estimate by more than one-third. Therefore, the price of grain soared endlessly!</p>
<p>The lake region produces approximately 16 million dan of grain annually, while the local demand is approximately 13 million dan. Judging from the current situation, the surplus grain is insufficient for three months of transportation. A poor harvest in the lake region would certainly cause a grain shortage throughout the province. Moreover, selling out all the grain from the lake region may not necessarily satisfy the rice merchants' greed. Therefore, the fertile fields on both banks of the Xiang River and the Zi River are constantly in danger of being devoured by rice weevils.</p>
<p>At the same time, to support the suppression of the rebellion, half of the one million dan of military grain must be delivered by the end of September. The Provincial Government has already dispatched senior officials to the eleven counties in the lake region to supervise the requisition. The people of Hunan have survived many calamities. They have suffered from war and natural disasters, and they will never forget the taste of white clay, tree bark, and grass roots. Therefore, they all predict what unfortunate consequences will arise from the constant outflow of grain.</p>
<p>Changsha is the nerve center of Hunan, so the soaring grain prices are particularly sensitive to the stimulation of citizens' lives and emotions. On September 3rd, they petitioned the municipal government, demanding price controls. However, the municipal government, having experienced "price increases after price controls" several times and given the recent frenzy of exporting grain throughout the province, could not "control" anything. Therefore, it pushed the responsibility to the Provincial Government in two sentences, saying: as long as the Provincial Government reinstates the ban, things will be easy to handle. Now, judging from the new trend of the Provincial Government, the reinstatement of the ban on grain exports should not be far off. (Li Yuren)</p>

<h3>Key Figure in Fujian Grain Embezzlement Case, Lin Zipei, Released on Bail, Parades Through the City in a "Romantic" Car</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 11th] Lin Zipei, the deputy director of the Lin Sen County Grain Department, abused his power while in office, extorting grain from various townships, embezzling over 500 million yuan in verifiable cases. This is another grain embezzlement case following the Rongfeng Rice Company case in Fuzhou last year, and it has attracted great attention from all parties. After the Fujian Provincial Grain Department submitted the relevant case files to the Fuzhou District Court for trial last month, he was prosecuted for crimes of embezzlement and dereliction of duty. He was ultimately sentenced to four years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights, which was well received by the people. Unexpectedly, the District Court restored his freedom on the second day after the sentence under the pretext of granting him bail due to illness. According to those familiar with the situation: the judge in charge did not open a court hearing to pronounce the sentence but instead had it executed by the District Prosecutor's Office. On the day after his imprisonment, he was released on bail due to illness. Since the offender is a criminal, if he has a serious illness and needs to seek medical treatment outside, it should be certified by a forensic doctor. Lin did not go through this procedure and was released immediately. The court cannot escape responsibility. Yesterday, Lin drove his "romantic" car (i.e., a tricycle) and paraded through the city, which was regarded by all parties as a particularly egregious case of moral decay. People could not help but sigh for the dignity of the judiciary. All newspapers today published this news, emphasizing that judicial administration should be thoroughly reformed. It is reported that the Provincial Government has sent a letter to the Fuzhou District Court to inquire about the reasons for Lin's release on bail.</p>

<h3>The Basic Education of China – Suggestions from Our Delegation to the Basic Education Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The Far East Basic Education Research Conference held in our capital, which convened from the 3rd to the 12th of this month, for a total of ten days, our Chinese delegation made suggestions regarding "Basic Education in China," and specially issued the following suggestions in writing after the meeting: (1) The goal of basic education in our country, in addition to earnestly promoting it in accordance with the provisions of current laws and regulations, should especially emphasize the improvement of individual life, the enhancement of social economy, and the increase of international understanding, so as to realize the ideals of people's livelihood, happiness and world harmony. (2) The promotion of basic education in our country must be like two wings working together, with adult literacy education and children's education advancing simultaneously, without any undue emphasis or neglect. (3) The experimental plans for basic education in our country should be coordinated with the domestic political, economic, social, and cultural realities, and the trends of world educational thought, to make choices. (4) Since basic education aims to improve the entire lives of those being educated, agriculture, industry, and various other industries should be important factors. To effectively promote it, it is impossible for educational administrative agencies to complete the task alone. Therefore, the government should have a comprehensive plan, uniting the departments of health, society, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, economy, internal affairs, and related agencies, to cooperate and promote it in coordination, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. (5) Basic education should be organized by local areas in principle, but the central government should also provide strong technical guidance and sufficient economic subsidies.</p>
<p>Popularizing Basic Education Expected Within No More Than Ten Years</p>
<p>(6) The central government should re-establish a concrete plan for popularizing basic education by year that is practical and feasible. The compulsory education for school-age children should be increased in years, extended to six years (border areas may be tentatively set at four years), and the content of adult literacy education should be enriched and its efficiency increased. The period for popularizing basic education should not exceed ten years from now. (7) In the national education expenditures of famous countries, basic education expenditures account for the vast majority. Currently, only 30 percent of our country's national education expenditure is used for basic education, which is the main reason why basic education is not easy to develop. In the future, the central government should allocate at least 15 percent of the total education expenditure to run and subsidize basic education, and should designate tax revenue as a source of funding for local basic education. When necessary, with the consent of local public opinion organs, a special basic education tax may be levied for special management. (8) In addition to the government establishing a large number of teacher training institutions to cultivate sufficient teachers, private individuals may also establish them to meet the needs, but they must still follow the guidelines of teacher education and the provisions of the training plan. (9) Basic education staff should have reasonable employment and protection, and their treatment must be improved. In addition to a sufficient increase in base salary, living allowances should be paid according to the standards of civil servants, and a system of annual salary increases, old-age pensions, and academic advancement should be implemented. (10) County and city education bureaus should be quickly and universally restored to their full capacity, and their powers should be improved and their treatment improved, so as to professionalize educational administration and increase administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Current Textbooks Adopt Both Review and Approval System</p>
<p>(11) The curriculum of basic education should be more practical and useful, and leave room for flexibility to adapt to local needs. The current textbooks should be widely collected from experts in all fields, discussed, edited, and improved, and a review and approval system should be adopted to allow for open competition in order to obtain good books. Reading materials for children and the public should be fully edited and improved to be widely available and for long-term supply. New and effective methods and tools should be introduced and encouraged as much as possible, and researched and tested to continuously improve them. (12) In promoting language education, the national phonetic alphabet should be used, the teaching of the national language should be vigorously promoted, the vocabulary and lexicon should be standardized, and the complexity of the characters should be simplified to increase the efficiency of education. (13) In order to provide a demonstration for the promotion of basic education, experimental areas should be selected in accordance with the principles of Article 3, in conjunction with relevant agencies and educational academic groups, to concentrate human and financial resources to study and improve practical and effective methods of education and life, in order to advocate them. And encourage and assist local areas to gradually promote this demonstration design. (14) Encourage private individuals to establish schools, and encourage educational academic groups to study educational methods, in order to improve the quality and quantity of basic education. (15) In order to promote basic education and promote its popularization, the Ministry of Education and local educational administrative agencies should convene experts to determine a plan and work together to realize it quickly.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Province Representatives Offer Three Suggestions</h3>
<p>The delegation of seven representatives from the Taiwan Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce attending the National Foreign Trade Conference, led by head Huang Zaisheng, arrived in Shanghai and yesterday released a written statement outlining the difficult situation in Taiwan and making three proposals for the National Foreign Trade Conference:</p>
<p>(1) Taiwan Province has the conditions for a solid industrial base, and its modern cultural and economic organization makes it easy to improve efficiency, so it should have a very important position in China's foreign trade. For the needs of industrial and commercial reconstruction, production equipment should be supplied in a planned manner from Japanese reparations. If this is insufficient, it is requested that the National Foreign Trade Conference suggest that the government relax controls and allow private imports. The implementation guidelines for organizing a business delegation to Japan should stipulate that medicines and medical equipment, fishing gear, raw materials for straw hats, and exported sugar, salt-processed products, and cassava flour (slurry flour) not be included in the list of goods imported and exported to Japan. (2) The Bank of Taiwan has not yet been designated as a bank authorized to handle foreign exchange, which causes many obstacles to trade in Taiwan and makes development impossible. It is requested that the government be advised to designate the Bank of Taiwan as a bank authorized to handle foreign exchange. (3) In order to develop trade and improve economic efficiency, it is requested that the government be advised to sell public enterprises as quickly as possible, and during the transition period, a part of their products should be allocated to private trading companies for management.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan Orders Strict Prohibition of Rice Exports</h3>
<p>The recent surge in rice prices in the city has been a great concern to Commander Xuan. Yesterday, he ordered a strict ban on rice exports and instructed the Water Police Brigade to be responsible for handling the matter. The brigade commander, Feng Zhongda, convened a cadre meeting yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to send personnel to the Pudong River export point to conduct strict patrols. Ships found to be loading rice without unloading and suspected of hoarding, or ships loading rice (including flour and miscellaneous grains) for export, will be detained and submitted for processing.</p>
<h3>Private Yarn Mills Propose Organizing a Joint Yarn Market Export Organization</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rong Hongyuan of the cotton textile industry, considering that the export of yarn and cloth is extremely restricted after the war, and the future of the textile industry is greatly affected, proposed a plan for the export of yarn and cloth to the National Trade Conference in order to compete for overseas markets and maintain the survival of private yarn mills. The reasons for his suggestions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>In order to promote China's export trade, earn foreign exchange, and strengthen the production capacity of the textile industry, it is proposed that private yarn mills organize a joint yarn and cloth export organization. Since the restriction on yarn and cloth exports in China, the effect on suppressing prices has been minimal, while yarn and cloth industry peers are currently threatened by international textile competition and the shortage of foreign exchange, making it impossible to fully prepare raw materials, expand machinery, and increase production. Surrounded by the above-mentioned new environment, if China does not actively establish overseas yarn and cloth markets in the future, the textile industry will have no future. The state-owned Textile Construction Corporation is actively promoting the export of yarn and cloth in order to enrich foreign exchange resources, and has signed sales contracts with overseas Chinese merchants, adopting the principle of importing raw cotton and exporting finished products to expand overseas markets. It is heard that their further plan is to set up warehouses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, Manila, and other places to meet local needs. From this point of view, state-owned yarn and cloth exports have a monopolistic trend. If private yarn and cloth are not opened for export at the same time at this time, it is not enough to talk about the possibility of comprehensive development of the cotton textile industry's foreign trade in the future. Regarding this issue, the economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Commission stipulates that the state-owned sector should provide 20% of its production volume for yarn and cloth exports, and the private sector should provide 10% to 20%. In order to survive, our private textile industry should seize the opportunity and promote yarn and cloth exports. In order to avoid international encroachment and prevent self-competition and the damage of foreign merchants taking advantage of price suppression, it is proposed that the conference put forward a cautious discussion and request the government to support it. The private yarn mills jointly organize a yarn and cloth export organization, unify exports, earn foreign exchange, order foreign cotton, and allocate it to various private yarn mills to increase production. Then, suppressing prices can also be effective, and the improvement of the factory's machinery, equipment, and technology can be gradually perfected.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Gold Shipped from Philippines to Australia; Value $2 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 13th] According to the Evening News, a batch of gold valued at US$2 million, weighing 43,760 taels, was transported to Macau by amphibious aircraft on the 12th. The Philippine government previously banned the export of gold in July at the request of the International Monetary Fund, but recently, due to pressure from gold merchants, the Ministry of Finance had to amend the ban, allowing this batch of gold transshipped from Mexico via Manila to reach its destination.</p>
<p>Another report states that President Roxas issued an order on the 12th to relax the ban on the transshipment and export of gold, allowing those who held licenses before July 19 of this year to export the gold that they actually had in the Philippines. The date coincides with the day the International Monetary Fund asked all member countries to ban gold shipments to non-members. The Ministry of Finance stated that if the holder of a transshipment license cannot prove that the gold they want to export is indeed in the Philippines, their license will be revoked. At the same time, the Atok Gold Mining Company has resumed mining. The Big Wedge Mine near Baguio mined gold worth US$203,269 in August. The Mindanao Gold Mining Company will start mining this month, and the produced gold nuggets can be listed on the San Francisco Gold Exchange within one or two months. However, mining industry insiders said that if the gold price is not raised from the current US$35 per tael, it will be difficult for Philippine gold exports to reach pre-war standards.</p>
<p>Increased Gold Production in the United States</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] The Bureau of Mines announced today that the rate of gold unearthed in the United States in July was the highest since 1942. The net production was 197,148 ounces, an increase of 30,000 ounces compared to June and an increase of 19% compared to the same month last year. The main reason is that large-scale production has resumed in Alaska this season.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Conducts Factory Surveys in Groups</h3>

The objects of the survey are (1) the general situation of factory personnel, (2) the equipment situation, (3) raw materials and products, (4) the power situation, and (5) the technician situation. It is expected to complete all the work within three months. This year, industrial and commercial guidance offices across the country have launched factory surveys in their respective locations.

<h3>Bank of China to Establish a Branch in Siam</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to diplomatic sources, the Bank of China plans to open a branch in Bangkok, Siam. The Siamese side had previously refused to agree. After active negotiations by our embassy in Siam with the Siamese government, it is now known that the Siamese parliament passed a bill on September 4 allowing the Bank of China to open a branch. The remittance problem of Siamese Chinese will be reasonably resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Autumn Sales Launched; Price Increases Forty Times Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>Although the sales volume of Zhejiang asphalt in this city is not as wide as that produced in Hubei, its position is also quite important. There are three types of products: "Heben, Pingyou, and Lanyou," with "Heben" as the standard, and the price fluctuations in the market are mainly based on Heben. Pingyou and Lanyou are currently out of stock and contain moisture, so they are not as popular as Hubei's "Macheng, Jianma, Chaixue, and Jingbai" oils. Currently, Zhejiang oil is in short supply, and inventories are scarce. The prices in Hubei oil-producing areas are high, and transportation is obstructed. Recently, candle and towel factories have launched autumn sales, and demand is strong. Yesterday, the price of "Heben" oil per market load had floated to 2 million yuan, an increase of up to 40 times compared to the same day last year.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Requests an Increase in the Number of National Representatives and Legislators</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to request an increase in the number of national representatives and legislators in the textile industry, the National Yarn Mill Federation convened its 23rd joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Shanghai on the 5th and decided to send Wu Weijing, Zhu Zhuyi, and Liu Piji as representatives to Beijing. They requested an increase in the number of national representatives in the textile industry to four and the number of legislators to two. Wu and his party returned to Shanghai a few days ago. According to reports, the Beijing meeting submitted petitions to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs, making three requests: (1) Increase the number of representatives. (2) Important industries should be reasonably allocated. (3) The number of seats occupied by the yarn mill industry should be determined. It is heard that the Legislative Yuan stated that the increase in the number of representatives only needs to be passed by the State Council before it can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, and the Ministry of Social Affairs also agreed in principle to all requests.</p>

<h3>Forerunner of the Renaissance – Commemorating the Death of Dante</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>— Written for the European Renaissance Festival</p>
<p>The transition from the dark ages of medieval Europe to modern times underwent a period of ideological transformation, which was the Renaissance movement. This movement was a religious innovation, a cultural revival and rebirth, but also a movement to resist theocracy, the Pope, and asceticism; and to establish a "worldly thought" that valued reason, nature, individuality, and freedom.</p>
<p>According to the classification of general art historians, the Renaissance can be roughly divided into three periods:</p>
<p>The first period is the period of natural development.</p>
<p>The second period is the period of antiquity imitation.</p>
<p>The third period is the period of heterodox art.</p>
<p>In the first period, there were three major figures as its representatives, namely Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. Among them, Dante Alighieri, although a medieval poet, was actually the founding ancestor of modern thought and the forerunner of the Renaissance!</p>
<p>Speaking of Dante, he was a tall man, often wearing a gray robe, a red crown on his head, surrounded by laurel leaves. Although he had a melancholic eagle-like face, he was the hero in the world's most bizarre and beautiful love story. He was born in Florence in 1265. At the age of nine, he met the girl Beatrice. Without exchanging a word, he fell in love at first sight, considering her the first joy of his soul. At the age of eighteen, he met the girl again, and both times they remained silent. Later, Beatrice got married, and died at the age of thirty-five. Dante wrote about her death:</p>
<p>"When I lost the 'first joy of my soul', I was pierced by sorrow, and there was nothing to comfort me."</p>
<p>Later, this love story was narrated in Dante's book: "The New Life".</p>
<p>Dante's greatest work in his life is "The Divine Comedy." It contains all the most beautiful and bizarre things in the Catholic Church. In it, you can see the essence of medieval philosophy, theology, and chivalry. The structure is magnificent, the ideas are sublime, the characters are bizarre and complex, the imagination is rich, and the writing is timeless! Some say that Dante is the only Latin who can compete with Shakespeare. In modern times, Dante is the only one who can compete with Homer!</p>
<p>Dante married at the age of thirty-one. In middle age, he was exiled due to political activities and wandered for the rest of his life. His will after his death: "I swear not to return my bones to my hometown." He died on September 14, 1321.</p>
<p>After being expelled from Florence, he traveled around, during which time he completed his great work "The Divine Comedy." Therefore, his own life is often scattered and narrated in the supernatural facts of "The Divine Comedy," including his own sad and moving love story; political struggles, and political affairs related to him.</p>
<p>"The Divine Comedy" is a book depicting "Heaven," "Hell," and "Purgatory." On the surface of the text, it is a fantasy about the state of the soul after death. In terms of allegory, it refers to the need for spiritual illumination and guidance.</p>
<p>The shape of "Hell" is a boundless trap, like an inverted cone, with its apex in the center. There are ten layers in this hell, and the most sinful people are in the lowest layer. Each layer has various bizarre descriptions, written as if it were a living reality.</p>
<p>"Purgatory," in Dante's imagination, is under the open sky. Around the mountain surrounding Purgatory, there are seven circles, each corresponding to one of the seven deadly sins recognized by the medieval church. In the lower layer are the sins of the traced soul, which, after touring the last layer of "Purgatory," enters the "Earthly Paradise" and sees Beatrice sitting in a chariot, surrounded by hundreds of little angels singing and scattering flowers. "Heaven" is the most glorious place in "The Divine Comedy." Dante traveled through the "Nine Heavens," "some fixed and immovable day!" Above the eight "heavens," the ninth heaven is the "crystal heaven," whose movement can guide the daily actions of the heavens. Nature, time, and motion all originate from this; all the divine influences in the world also originate from this. Above this heaven, the apex of that illusion is the infinite and motionless divine "Sea of Love."</p>
<p>This masterpiece of rich imagination is the product of Dante's twenty years of wandering and poverty. Therefore, his "Divine Comedy" opens with the words:</p>
<p>"When I was halfway through my life, I got lost and fell into the dark forest!"</p>
<p>In short, "The Divine Comedy" represents the summary of Dante's thoughts. It is written in Italian "vulgar" language, not in ancient language. Although it is based on the Middle Ages, its spirit and appearance are modern. Therefore, it is said that Dante and his great work "The Divine Comedy" are the founding ancestors and forerunners of the Renaissance!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Dante, a literary giant who lived 626 years ago, is not only memorable for his beautiful and moving love story, nor is he only memorable for his immortal masterpiece—The Divine Comedy, nor is he only memorable for his participation in political movements; just as medieval commentators did not regard him as a great poet, but as an intelligent prophet. What we should recognize more is the philosopher's philosophy and thought and its influence; he is the bridge between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Therefore, general historians use the year of his death (1321) to divide the Middle Ages and the Modern Ages, which is indeed very meaningful. It is a pity that our country still does not have a complete translation of "The Divine Comedy" that can be used for introduction.</p>

<h3>North Sea Painting Exhibition and Cheng Zhu Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>On the September 18th Memorial Day, there will be two painting exhibitions in Shanghai;</p>
<p>One is the painting exhibition of Mr. Zhu Yingpeng held in the Chinese Art Garden, and the other is the painting exhibition of Ms. Ling Chengzhu held in the Youth Association.</p>
<p>Although these two painting exhibitions are held at the same time, their painting styles are completely different, which can be an interesting contrast. Before seeing their works, if we infer the styles of the two based on general ideals, thinking that the paintings of men are always grand and majestic, and the paintings of women are always graceful and beautiful, then the paintings of these two are quite the opposite. The paintings of men are graceful and beautiful, while the paintings of women are grand and majestic. The paintings of men have a bit of femininity, while the paintings of women have a bit of masculinity.</p>
<p>Mr. Yingpeng, also known as Beihai, is one of the veterans in the Shanghai art world. He originally studied traditional Chinese painting, and then studied Western painting for more than 20 years. After September 18th, he began to specialize in traditional Chinese painting again. He is generous and heroic, and thinks highly of himself, but the paintings he makes are meticulous and meticulous, small and exquisite, without any unrestrained habits. His profound light and light color, a kind of quiet and elegant interest, can make the viewers release their irritability and vanity, and remove their vulgar thoughts. "A hundred refined steels turn into a soft finger" "The extreme of splendor returns to plainness", the high realm of painting is truly admirable. The paintings do not include inscriptions, let alone poems. The inscriptions are written on the poetry hall after the decoration, which is especially in line with the relics of the Tang and Song people. His daughter, Ms. Mingwang, specializes in Tang Dynasty dancers, and also exhibited 30 works this time, all of which are extremely exquisite.</p>
<p>Ms. Chengzhu is from a prominent family in Beiping. She learned painting from Mr. Xiao Qianzhong, Xiao Wuyuan, Tang Dingzhi, Chen Banding, and Wang Mengbai in her childhood. Her brushstrokes are bold and unrestrained, recently drawing on the essence of Bai Shi and Wu Lao, and remotely drawing on the charm of Shi Tao and Bada, and also adding the humor of Bai Yang and Tianchi. There is no feminine air in her works. She has traveled extensively in the north and south provinces, and has a reputation wherever she goes. Although there are many female painters in Shanghai, there are few who can pass on the style of Wu Lao in freehand flowers and plants. The colors and ink are dripping, and the brush is as fast as wind and rain, which can make the viewers excited and excited. She is gentle and elegant, and polite, and is worthy of being a typical female in Beiping.</p>
<p>Some people say: "Painting is like the person." After seeing the paintings of the two, this sentence is probably not very applicable.</p>

<h3>Lotus (One of the Exhibits in the Centennial Painting Exhibition)</h3>
<p>Ren Yu, also known as Lifan, was from Xiaoshan. He inherited the family learning of his father, Weichang, and his flowers and birds were very similar to his father, while his landscapes opened up new paths. However, he was of a sparse and casual nature, living a life of wanderer in Shanghai, and whenever he was in a difficult situation, if someone came with money, he would immediately paint for them, otherwise he would not respond. This painting is a work of the late years of Baiyang Shanren, with elegant brushstrokes, made casually, with a deep interest in plainness, and the ink and color are moist and elegant, very similar to Bai Chang. (Chen Yishi Knowledge)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Preview of Dai Qiren's National Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Liu Shuyou</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where talent gathers, encompassing all sorts of wonders. Some compare it to the "Paris of the East," and indeed, that is not far from the truth. There are also particularly more art exhibitions held in Shanghai than in other cities. Among these diverse exhibitions, some are speculative merchants passing off imitations for business gain, some are "begging for contributions" by relying on their political connections, and some are exhibiting genuine achievements in artistic cultivation. However, the former two types constitute the majority, which clearly shows the decline of social culture and the sluggishness of the social economy. Mr. Dai Qiren's painting exhibition had a preview yesterday at the New Life Club and is officially opening today for a two-day public exhibition. People in Shanghai can see the style of this painter who has just come from the rear. My impression and feelings from today's preview are as follows: This painter's style can be said to be entirely for art's sake, creating as an artist entirely for art's sake, burying himself in hard work. His flowers and birds, at the very least, are free from the air of commercialism and the stench of the mundane. Although his painting methods are derived from the ancients, there is no place where he is confined by the old methods of the ancients. In every painting, one can see that he is creating, he is sketching from life. Although creating and sketching from life, his every brushstroke is particularly imbued with ancient charm. Each flower and tree, each branch and leaf, is carefully managed and boldly painted. A kind of simple and profound quality, and a magnificent spirit, overflows onto the paper and hides beneath the ink. For example, in the exhibited works of peony, peony, sunflower, red plum, etc., none are without the elegance of color and ink, and the strength of the brush. The willow warblers, flocks of pigeons, roosters, eagles, and egrets that he paints all conform to natural sentiments and reason, without relying on fiction. Their flight and rest, the chirping of sparrows and the cries of cranes, are all lifelike. As the saying goes, "Responding to objects and depicting their forms, conveying their colors according to their kind," he deeply understands the Six Principles of ancient painting. As for those who often depict flying horses in the sky and swimming dragons in the sea, Mr. Dai does not adopt those. Nor does he emulate those who splash ink and smear dan, being crude and wild, thinking themselves innovative and superior, and then criticizing society for lacking the ability to appreciate, boasting about their own uniqueness. As for those erotic works such as "Consort Yang emerging from the bath" and "Raising Hell in the Grape Arbor," which are charming and moving, and single-mindedly catering to society's degraded psychology, Mr. Dai does not even consider them. Although I don’t dare to say that Mr. Dai's exhibition sweeps away the trend of frivolity, at least it can serve as a lesson for those who are superficial and shallow.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of White</h3>
<p>— Ye Dongfeng</p>
<p>As Yaoqun stepped out of the gate, she paused slightly, then crossed to the opposite side of the street. She strolled back and forth in front of a row of shops, as if she wanted to buy something but couldn't make up her mind. In reality, she was assessing the situation of the restaurant across the street, looking for a suitable place to leave a secret mark for Little Tiger. Among several suitable locations, she settled on a grayish-white brick, about four or five inches square, on the lower left corner of the "China Restaurant" signboard. The surroundings were all obscured, but it perfectly met the conditions for installing a secret mark.</p>
<p>What exactly was this "secret mark"? Because in the old stronghold, small teams often set out to fight guerrillas two or three hundred li away. These small teams of dozens of people could, of course, travel together in the mountains and fields, but sometimes they had to pass through towns and busy cities to stop. With so many people, it was unavoidable to draw attention, so before entering the city, the small team would break up into twos and threes, each finding a place to stay. However, they were afraid of losing contact, so each group's lodging location had a secret mark; their own people could recognize it at a glance. This was somewhat similar to the "notes" used by secret societies all over the country, using red or yellow paper with inexplicable words or phrases like "...Da Ta Descends Altar..." and pasting them diagonally on walls along the way. Those in the know could tell the direction and location of the meeting by the angle.</p>
<p>But the secret marks of the old stronghold, after Yaoqun's improvement, became very hidden and concise. Outsiders would absolutely not be able to discover them easily, but their own people, upon seeing them, would not only understand that comrades from the stronghold were staying there, but also their rank and name. For example, Yaoqun was the captain of the seventh team, so her secret mark was the number "7". The location for leaving this mark was only at the corners of houses, the left and right sides of door frames, around the signboard, etc. However, the location had to have obscuring colors, patterns, or traces on all sides to avoid attracting the attention of outsiders. The tool for making this mark was not fixed; sometimes white chalk, sometimes black lead or other colored items, and sometimes just a small knife or awl for carving. As for the rank, the one marking the very center of the location was definitely the captain, the upper two corners were for squad leaders, and the lower two corners were for team members. But when leaving, the secret mark had to be removed.</p>
<p>This type of secret marking was quite easy to use outside the customs, but it was not as complex and complete as the secret marks of Bai Ren Village (see The Sword Master of the Sea House), which could express the task, direction, time, and meaning, and the lead powder used was mixed with luminous substances like phosphorus and radium, so it was faintly visible even in the dark of night; after a certain amount of time, it could also dissipate and disappear on its own. This, of course, had a much greater effect than the method used by Yaoqun.</p>
<p>Yaoqun did not really need to make any secret mark here, because in the "French Concession" area, there were basically only a few lodges where one could stay, such as Dahua, Yuzhong, Guomin, etc. Other older styles without bedding, such as Weifa, Changchun, etc., seven or eight in total, would certainly not be chosen. Moreover, seeing Yaoqun's number "7" was also a clear indicator; room numbers 7, 17, 27 (6 and 8 also included), etc., as long as there was a "7", and the list of other guests had Miss Ji, wouldn't it be very obvious? Why would she need to put a secret mark outside the door? Under this clear and bright sky, with everything so obvious, doing this would not only be dangerous, but no matter how clever and alert Yaoqun was, it would add a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>However, this step, for the sake of Little Tiger, could not be omitted. Just thinking that the information Little Tiger was going to retrieve might be time-sensitive, or a secret operation that required seizing the moment, and these four or five suitable lodges were not lined up on the same street, calling him to run back and forth a long way, searching one lodge at a time, would not only be exhausting but might also delay important matters. Therefore, under the condition of "weighing the two evils and choosing the lesser," Yaoqun was willing to make things a little more difficult for herself.</p>

<h3>New Wood Products</h3>
<p>— Tang Yao</p>
<p>Wood is an important organic raw material. In recent years, its application in aeronautical engineering has achieved surprising results. Through modern technological processing, the mechanical strength and stability of several refined wood products can be compared to mild steel. Impregnated paper, a kind of refined wood product, has tensile strength and lightness exceeding that of the light metal aluminum. In the United States, factories producing over ten thousand gallons of industrial alcohol annually from wood chips and waste have been established. The use of wood as a raw material for manufacturing plastics is also gradually increasing. Therefore, it is no wonder that Americans view their Forest Products Laboratory as the world's greatest magician, or call wood a magical raw material. I have previously introduced several new American wood products, such as urea-plasticized wood (Urea-Plasticized Wood or Uralloy), anti-shrink wood (Impreg), compressed wood (Compreg), lignin plastics, and paper-based plastics (Papreg). (See Sea King, Vol. 17, Nos. 11 and 20). Here, I intend to review the new technologies and important inventions related to wood in the past thirty years, in order to gain a glimpse into the amazing contributions of wood in recent years. If this can further promote the modernization of forest product utilization, it would be my humble intention.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century, the world had no way to control the drying of wood. When the European War broke out, the United States needed a large amount of dried wood to manufacture aircraft. Mr. Tiemann, an American, pioneered a water-spray kiln that could control relative humidity, allowing wood to dry in a short time with minimal warping. As a result, a large amount of aircraft material was supplied, marking the beginning of artificial drying of wood. This is one. Wood has quite different properties in the axial and transverse directions; therefore, the manufacture of fuselages and wings mostly uses thin sheets of wood with overlapping grains, glued together. This technology also made considerable progress during the First European War, truly opening up the research and manufacture of synthetic resins, and is closely related to modern refined wood products. This is the second.</p>
<p>Germany has made significant achievements in improving the use of wood fibers, enhancing the properties of wood, and solving problems in clothing and food through its knowledge of wood chemistry and applied chemical engineering. Several kinds of refined wood, such as Bakelisiertes Holz, Ligno tone, Panzerhloz, and Metalholz, differ in importance, but it is commendable that they use scientific and industrial technology to compensate for the shortcomings of wood and increase its utilization. In the UK, impregnated laminated, compressed wood is also used in aircraft manufacture. However, the US Forest Products Laboratory is the giant in terms of technological contributions to wood. Here are some of its most important contributions:</p>
<p>(1) Preventing Wood Shrinkage: In 1937, Mr. A.J. Stamm, a chemical expert at the US Forest Products Laboratory, devoted himself to research on the colloidal chemistry of wood, aiming to synthesize artificial resins within the submicroscopic structure of wood cell walls, in order to make the wood itself lose the ability to expand and contract. This is the basic principle of research on anti-shrinkage of wood.</p>
<p>(2) Wood-Based Plastics: Mr. E.E. Harris, an expert in lignin at the US Forest Products Laboratory, made plastics from wood chips seven or eight years ago. His method was to place wood chips in a digester and first subject them to mild hydrolysis. The steam pressure used was usually 135-200 pounds per square inch. After washing and filtering, the chips were ground into powder and made into plastics. Experiments were conducted by adding 25% phenol resin to 75% hydrolyzed wood and pressing it at a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of 3000-4000 pounds per square inch. In recent years, through technical improvements, it has been possible to mold huge objects for engineering applications. This kind of finished product has excellent water resistance, acid resistance, and insulation properties, with a bending strength of 8000-13000 pounds per square inch and absorbing only 0.2-0.3% of moisture after being immersed in water for 48 hours.</p>
<p>(3) Chemical Seasoning: Mr. W.K. Loughborough, a wood drying expert at the US Forest Products Laboratory, observed that when wood is dried, the surface is often dry while the interior is still wet. According to his research, if the moisture in the wood can be dried from the inside out, gradually reaching the surface, many defects caused by improper drying can be avoided. He immersed the wood to be dried in appropriate chemicals, such as salt, penetrating the wood on all sides, preventing the exterior from drying in the early stages of drying, and allowing the moisture inside to slowly move to the surface. This has significantly improved the drying of swamp oak, which is very difficult to dry. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Artificial Ice-Free Ports</h3>
<p>— Ge Ming</p>
<p>Two Swedish scientists—B.O. Persson and E. Forsland—have come up with a way to keep northern ports ice-free all year round, allowing navigation. Their method is to immerse many open pipes underwater in the port, through which a liquid flows from a compressor and pipeline on shore. Warmer water rises from below, melting the ice on the surface or preventing the upper layer from solidifying into ice. The openings of the pipes immersed underwater are curved into arcs, so the hot water released will form waves, spreading in all directions to prevent large areas from freezing. In addition, this newly invented design can also be used to keep the water around hydroelectric power stations and rivers used for transporting wood ice-free.</p>
<h3>Electric Lamp Beetles</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In the tropical regions of the Americas, there is a beetle that is about one and a half inches long. On both sides of its chest, there are transparent, window-like parts, about the size of bullets, which are the source of bright light.</p>
<p>The light it emits does not flicker like a firefly, but can continue for more than five minutes almost every time, so it seems as if it is always shining and never goes out.</p>
<p>The natives there put these beetles in small boxes as a substitute for flashlights. They can walk in the dark just like with a flashlight.</p>
<h3>Human Life in the Arctic</h3>
<p>— Song Liwu</p>
<p>Human activity is greatly influenced by the natural environment. Climate is the most basic element of the natural environment and is closely related to human life. The Antarctic continent, covered in ice and snow, is sparsely populated. Except for the area near the North Pole, which has not been fully explored because no expeditions have ventured there, the Eurasian and North American continents and islands north of 60 degrees north latitude have long been inhabited by humans. The Eskimos of Greenland have a long history, with a current population of about 20,000. The Siberians and Lapps live on the mainland and islands of the Eastern Hemisphere. In recent years, islands in the Arctic Ocean have become the target of competition among various countries, and workers have been flocking there. The United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries have established many Arctic research stations, and have advanced to 82 degrees north latitude. Therefore, the climatic conditions of the Arctic, with a little artificial equipment, are not enough to limit human health and excitement. Various pathogens and vectors of infectious diseases are not easy to grow and develop, so tropical epidemic diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, black fever, and malaria are extremely rare. Respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, meningitis, measles, smallpox, diphtheria, and scarlet fever are also less common than in the winter of temperate zones. Moreover, the low temperature makes it easier to preserve objects for a longer time. For example, the Soviet Rudolf Island depot sealed the island's houses, armories, food reserves, fuel, and clothing in 1942. When personnel returned there again in May of this year, after five years, the stored materials were still in good condition.</p>
<p>However, certain conditions in the Arctic environment still greatly affect human health. For example, the half-year-long nights in winter have very weak light, with no direct sunlight, lacking ultraviolet rays. All activities are restricted, and physical health is also affected. Arctic plants are not easy to grow, and the local area lacks fresh plant-based foods and fruits. The supply of nutritional vitamins is cut off, so scurvy is very common among residents of the extremely cold zone, and their faces are pale, especially during the winter nights. Therefore, expedition teams or research station personnel must not only prepare canned food and pickled fish and meat, but also frequently airlift fresh fruits and vegetables to supply the workers (Eskimos can avoid this disease because they often eat semi-cooked or raw animal meat, blood, and seafood). Humans who have lived in the polar regions for a long time have very low resistance to infectious diseases, so once external pathogens are introduced, epidemics easily spread. For example, since the Eskimos have interacted with humans in civilized societies, their physical condition has gradually weakened, and their population is not as large as it used to be. The reason is this. In addition, frostbite should be prevented at all times, especially systemic frostbite under extremely low temperatures. Localized frostbite (such as on the hands, feet, and face) is easier to treat and less serious. People with poor health (such as anemia, heart weakness, and malnutrition) and those who are addicted to alcohol should not be sent to work in the Arctic, because alcohol dilates blood vessels, and internal heat is easily dissipated, making it difficult to maintain body temperature. When working outdoors, the strong reflection of light by ice and snow can easily damage eyesight, so amber-colored glasses must be worn at all times to prevent this.</p>
<h3>Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Salty</h3>
<p>— Zhao Nan</p>
<p>In ancient China, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent were classified as the five tastes. However, recent scientific research has proven that pungency is a type of stimulation, a sensation of the skin. Therefore, the tastes currently recognized by physiologists and psychologists are only sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. All other tastes are formed by the combination of these four main tastes.</p>
<p>Sugar is sweet, vinegar is sour, Coptis chinensis is bitter, and salt is salty. What is the principle by which our tongues can distinguish them one by one? The physiological function of this taste is actually a chemical action. Therefore, taste has a certain relationship to the chemical composition of substances. The sweetness of sucrose is due to the presence of eight hydroxyl groups in its molecule; and the strength of the sweetness of alcohols and their derivatives in all organic compounds is also determined by the number of hydroxyl groups in their constituent molecules. Similarly, sourness is due to hydrogen ions, and saltiness is due to the molecules of sodium chloride itself.</p>
<p>Concentration and temperature have significant effects on taste. Taking sweetness as an example, the sweetness that can be perceived at room temperature is a 0.1% solution, but at zero degrees, a 0.4% solution is required. At the same time, the highest temperature at which we can perceive sweetness is 52 degrees Celsius, and it becomes difficult to distinguish beyond that. As for salt, it must weigh more than 0.007 grams for us to be able to feel it.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of our tongues to taste is different in different parts. Generally, the back half of the tongue near the taste organs is the most sensitive, followed by the edge and tip of the tongue. This physiologically mysterious structure unconsciously prompts us to swallow our favorite foods. The reaction speed of the tongue to tastes is also different in different parts; the back of the tongue generally reacts faster than the tip of the tongue. Our reaction to bitterness is generally slower than to sweetness, and the residual effect is stronger. Therefore, when you take bitter medicine mixed with sugar, you will first feel the sweetness, and then the bitterness. By the time the sweetness has gone, the bitterness still remains.</p>
<p>When salty and sweet tastes are used at the same time, they will mutually cancel each other out or even strengthen each other. For example, if you mix sugar and salt in an appropriate ratio and then dissolve them in water, if it is very dilute, there will be no special taste; if it is very concentrated, not only will the two tastes not do anything special, but they will also have a dull salty taste. This phenomenon is very interesting, and readers may want to try it.</p>
<p>Scientific Book Review</p>
<h3>POTASH SODA PROCESS</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiande</p>
<p>Although this book is written in English, and the entire book has only fifty pages besides the preface and table of contents, on the surface it seems like it has no value for introduction, but this is not the case. Because the author in this book only writes about the new method of manufacturing soda ash (also known as washing soda, Sodium Carbonate) from potash, which has been patented. However, the author is unwilling to keep it secret and has sincerely and frankly written it out, which can not only provide a reference for people in the chemical industry, but also can be said to be a new development in China's alkali manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The main point of this book is that the author introduces the new method for manufacturing soda ash that he invented, and the equipment for manufacturing alkali according to the new method, etc. In the past, there were only three methods for manufacturing pure alkali: the Leblanc Process, the Solvay Process, and the Electrolytic Process. The main raw material of the Leblanc Process is mirabilite, which was previously mainly obtained as a by-product of manufacturing hydrochloric acid. However, now most hydrochloric acid is manufactured by direct synthesis (which is no less advanced even in China), so the Leblanc Process has become obsolete. The main raw material of the Solvay Process is ammonia gas. Although this raw material is quite cheap in European and American countries, the situation is different in China. The price of ammonia is quite expensive, and there are very few factories specializing in its manufacture, so it is very clear that the Solvay Process is not suitable for China. Finally, regarding the electrolytic method, it is even less suitable for China, because the main alkali product of the electrolytic method is not pure alkali but sodium hydroxide. Then, sodium hydroxide solution is used to pass in carbon dioxide gas to produce pure alkali. I think there may be no one in China willing to do this! Because the value of sodium hydroxide is several times more expensive than pure alkali from the start.</p>
<p>But the author's new method is completely different. It can indeed meet all the realistic conditions in China. Its raw materials are the most common potash and table salt. The main source of potash is extracted from grass ash, grain ash, wood ash, or tung husk ash, which are discarded or considered garbage by people. Although table salt is more expensive than raw materials such as grass ash, etc., which are considered waste, it is not too alarming.</p>
<p>The interaction of potash solution and salt brine produces crystals of soda ash and potassium chloride. Then, the author's proposed method of Chilling Process separates the soda ash crystals from potassium oxide at low temperatures. After washing with cold water, centrifuging, and recrystallizing, extremely pure soda ash, which is the so-called washing soda, is obtained.</p>
<p>Or, before the mixture of soda ash and potassium chloride is separated, carbon dioxide gas is passed in to convert all the soda ash in the solution into sodium bicarbonate and precipitate it. The precipitated sodium bicarbonate is filtered out and then strongly heated to release the originally absorbed carbon dioxide, becoming very high-quality soda ash. This is also one of the author's methods, the Carbonating Process. This method can not only produce very high-quality soda ash, but also manufacture very pure sodium bicarbonate.</p>
<p>In the last chapter of the book, the author also wrote many methods for manufacturing sodium hydroxide, which are very valuable and not easily found in ordinary textbooks and magazines.</p>
<p>The writing technique can also be said to be well-organized and not at all chaotic. Each chapter begins with some theoretical discussions, followed by the actual working conditions, so that readers will not have a feeling of blindly following without a basis. However, what is lacking is diagrams.</p>
<p>We admire the author's unselfish scientific spirit. His contribution—Potash Sode Process—will have a far-reaching impact on the development of China's chemical industry.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox A Student Apprentice Drifting Alone in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am very sorry, today I have taken the liberty of writing this letter to you. I hope you can spare a few minutes from your busy schedule to read it and not throw it into the wastepaper basket. I came to Shanghai only four days ago. Before that, I was an apprentice at a sundries store in Changshu. This was the "future" my father chose for me two years ago. In fact, my family was not poor at that time. My father was a "landlord" with more than a hundred acres of land, and the family's financial situation was sufficient for me to continue my studies. However, my father was a true "mercantilist." He believed that studying was useless and that doing business was better, so I was sent to work as an apprentice in a grocery store. I endured it for two whole years. If I had endured another year and a half, I would have "graduated," but I was unwilling to do so. I wanted to pursue my own future. I have my own wishes, I have my own ambitions.</p>
<p>Encouraged by a beautiful vision, I resolutely realized my drifting life. After coming to Shanghai, I lived in the home of a childhood friend. He is very poor and of course cannot give me much help. Every day, I rely on pancakes and fried dough sticks to maintain my life. Since I have come to Shanghai, my only purpose is to continue my studies. However, given my situation, there is absolutely no possibility of entering the school gate. I hope to get help from a "scholarship." In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, I visited more than a dozen schools in a row, but in the end, I was blocked out of the gates by "academic qualifications," "certificates," "diplomas," and so on. And the ten yuan I brought with me is almost used up. In this vast sea of people in Shanghai, how can I survive the long days to come? I have decided not to go home. I hope to find some work in Shanghai to maintain my life and continue my studies in my spare time. I beg you to give me a clear indication and hope you can give me effective assistance. With best wishes for your well-being, Respectfully, Xiaosheng. Reply to be published tomorrow.</p>
