<h3>各路援軍及時趕到　臨朐城昨完全解圍　匪被內外夾擊已總崩潰</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南卅日電〕臨朐之圍已解，卅日由南麻，悅莊方面北上增援之名路國軍，於午前巳佔城東八公里幕虎山，尼姑山，城西十公里上下五井之綫，正與孤軍苦守城垣達七畫夜之李彌將軍所部內外夾擊，共匪已總崩潰。</p>
<p>〔本報臨沂卅日電〕臨朐城爭　戰之劇烈，較最近魯西南　山美之戰尤有過之，軍以最少數部隊，敵十五倍之匪，達七晝夜之久，全城至廿九日晚，東西北三門皆已被匪突入，至卅日實為最危急時期，國軍僅保有南關一角高地，及城東之朐山，其間且一度與後方失去蓮絡，幾疑該城業已陷落者，然卒因李彌將軍之卓越指揮，全軍將士之有進無退，空軍之曾惡劣氣候接濟，自廿四日至卅日苦戰連七整畫夜，至今日午前，南路增援之各路大軍終於到達城東八公里幕虎山，尼姑山，城西約十里之上五井一帶，與城內守軍取得呼應後，正自棄外予陳毅七個縱隊殘匪猛力夾擊中。</p>
<p>〔中央社青島卅日電〕圍攻臨朐魯中共匪主力三十日下午四時開始總崩潰，殘匪分兩股向高崖益都逃竄，陣地已成血海，匪遺屍兩萬餘具，被俘與投誠為數極衆，國軍奪獲之武器，可裝備一個旅。需內守軍今與北上部隊握手，擊潰魯中共匪主力後的，現正分向逃匪迫殱中。</p>
<p>〔本報兗州卅日電〕王司令官耀武赴泰安視察公畢，卅一日返濟南。</p>

<p>〔本報天津卅日電〕津浦北段國軍三十日拂曉自獨流，靜海，唐官屯三路西進，渡過龍港河，向子牙河丁岸王口鎭，子牙鎭據點掃蕩，該地匪軍為冀中軍區劉秉彥部六三，六四，六五，三團及囚民大隊共三四千人激戰至中午，王口鎭子牙鎭均被國軍克復，匪軍向文安潰邊，津浦北段西側威脅已解除。進抵與濟附近國軍，三十日繼續整理陳地，未向前推展，靜海唐官屯間三十日汽車已通。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽卅日電〕鄭洞國談：共匪大部集平梅路上，企圖發動第六次攻勢，時間可能能在八月下旬或九月初，惟是時正逢雨季，行動補給均受阻制，難能如願。共匪兵員補充不受任何限制，四平損害雖大，但戰事甫吿結束束，補充兵員已由江北送來，國軍現正密切注親其發展。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕全國糧食會議，定卅一日上午十時舉行第三次大會，討論張院長交議之實施辦法及陝西省提案六件，會後即舉行閉幕式，仍由張院長主持。分省商討，卅日上午續由俞飛鵬主持，召集雲·貴·甘·寗·熱·靑·新等省代表商談完畢，十二時蔣主席就勵志肚歡宴出席會議之各省主席，即席作近一小時之訓示，就常前國內外局勢以迄刷新地方政治等各點，作重要訓示。糧長俞飛鵬卅日對該會經過向記者表示滿意，認爲各省主席多能奉行政府意旨，惟各省議長在民意立塲上頗有請求變更少處，預料本年征實。征借可不致超過八千萬袒，各省征額待大會決定後，即可疑以爲準，然此朮須視各省收成而定。卅一日晚七時，黨政軍三首要吳鐵城，陳立　，陳　歡宴出席會議全體代表。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕政院於糧食會議閉幕後，二日起召集各省田糧處長，舉行全國田賦會議，曹期兩日。</p>

<h3>行政院新聞局　記者招待會</h3>
<p>董局長答復詢問</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕政院新聞局長靑顯光，卅日下午四時半在記者招待會中答復記者詢問如次：</p>
<p>問：政府是否將設法使　德邁將軍與中共代表會面？</p>
<p>問：如中共採取主　步驟，欲與魏將軍會談，政府將予贊助否？</p>
<p>答：此純係假想性質之問題，本人無法奉答。</p>
<p>問：中國政府對其政治·經濟及軍事之基本需要·將扼要以吿魏德邁將軍否？中國政府所需要者如何？</p>
<p>答：恕余此時尚不能奉吿。</p>
<p>問：就魏德邁將軍所表示者，目前美國之對華態度如何？</p>
<p>答：魏德邁將軍此次奉派來華考察事實，即足表示美國政府對中國情勢之關切。</p>
<p>問：魏德邁將軍考察新「事實」，能獲得馬歇爾將軍所未發現，或美國大使館所未經知悉之「事實」否？</p>
<p>答：唯有魏德邁將軍於任務吿成之時，或能答復此項問題。</p>
<p>問：中國政府希望魏將軍對美國政府提出何種建議？</p>
<p>答：余甚以無可奉吿爲歉。</p>
<p>問：董局長以爲魏將電將提出何種建議？</p>

<p>問：上海吳市長籲請解決上海憲警衝突事件，國防部對此將採何種反應步驟？</p>
<p>答：此雖係地方事件，因情形較爲車大，憲兵司令部及警察總署已派高級人員前往處理，以期早日解決。</p>
<p>問：最近軍事情形如何？</p>
<p>答：山東上週仍爲激戰之中心，魯中方面，截至昨日爲止，一週間戰事，以臨朐爲最劇，共匪調集第二·六·七·九縱隊，另一快速縱隊及第五縱隊之主力，合計集中五個縱隊以上之兵力，猛攻臨朐，戰事刻尚在進行，惟守城部隊巳渡渦危急時期。魯南方面，匪軍第一，四兩縱隊暨第五縱隊之一部，已在滕縣越津浦路西撤，此股共匪，與魯境其他匪軍之聯繫，已遭完全切斷。魯西方面，羊山寨情况不明，但該地迤西之國軍，已收復臨　鎮與董口，至豫北方面，國軍已收復修武，惟焦作煤區尚在共匪猛攻中。</p>

<h3>孚中揚子兩公司當局　說明營業情況　對牽涉進出口條例事有所聲辯</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕近日京滬各報登載關於孕中等公司破壞進出口條例，經本埠中外各報轉載後，頗爲各界所注意，頃據孚中實業公司董事長錢新之說明該公司情形如下：</p>
<p>問：孚中公司是否向中央銀行結滙至美元一億五千餘萬元之鉅</p>
<p>答：孚中在近一年半中，結匯僅一百五十餘萬元，內中二十餘萬元，係孚中將自有外匯抵充，有帳可精。</p>
<p>問：孚中公司總經理宋子良有股權若干？</p>
<p>答：孚中股本全部爲交通，國貨，金城三銀行所投資，此外無分文私人資本，宋子良係代表國貨參加，余亦代表交通參加，余及宋君均無分文投資。</p>
<p>問：孚中公司進口汽車，有否破壞進出口條例？</p>
<p>答：孚中進口吉普車及結匯，係遵照海關第五十一號，第五十五號及第八十號之佈吿，孚中進口吉普旅行車，係在輸入管理委員會分配限額內，查輸入管理委員會分配孚中三十五年全年限額僅一〇一輛，較之該會給與其他若干汽車商之限額為少。</p>
<p>問：孚中進口無綫電情形如何</p>
<p>答：孚中爲美國西屋電氣公司之代理人，卅五年初，中央航空公司鑒於該公司在上海及國內各機塲電訊設備之需要改進，故與孚中公司訂約，定購大枇電訊器材，嗣因西屋罷工頻起，故交貨因而延期，外間所傳孚中進口無綫電，即係中央航空公司器材之誤，蓋國外廠商運貨時提單上祇簡寫「無綫電若千箱」，故人均誤爲普通所用無綫電，余已詳細查明，孚中公司自開創迄今，並未經營普通無綫電收音機美務，且從未進口。</p>
<p>問：外問誤會之原因，錢先生有何意見否？</p>
<p>答：孚中之創設，在抗戰將結束時，三銀行為配合政府戰後工業化建設起見，戰前所有進口器材及出口土產，均假手於人，抗戰後國人似應注意經營此業，對於國家整個經濟，必有裨益，自組織後，孚中即接治獲得美國有名大廠家數家之在華代理人，故戰前資格較老，或已享有旣得權益之商人，感受影響，彼輩為競爭及利害關係計，當　　造謠挑發也，實際上三十五年孚中全部營業額，較之老資格之進口商，小得可憐，余意國人應注意比較去年各大公司所得外匯與孚中所得外匯，執多執少，方爲公允。</p>
<p>又據揚子公司負責人談稱：「揚子公司係於三十五年一月成立，迄本年四月底止，在十六個月謂結外匯僅一百八十餘萬美元，而報載爲一億八千餘萬美元，相差百倍，或許是小數點上之錯誤，關於進口貨物中之無綫電三具，曾取得合法手續，且係購備自用者。至於化妝品二百二十八箱退回一節，則並無其事。截至最近止，該公司在出口業務上結售政府外匯一百二十八萬元，進出口外匯相抵，淨向政府結得外匯五十餘萬元，以十九個月分配，每月僅三萬元左右。此數亦不爲鉅」云云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京州日電〕監察委員王冠吾建議政府，應成立一特別委員會，澈底調查孚中公司，建設銀公司及揚子貿易公司三公司之賬目。王冠吾為政府所派赴滬調查該三公司活動之監察委員之一。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕政院新聞局卅日下午四時招待記者會中，有記者詢問關於孚中·　子兩公司破壞進出口條例之事件，政府將如何處理，董局長稱：此事正由有開機開負責調查中，本人餘無可奉吿者。</p>
<h3>空軍參謀學校　今晨行畢業禮</h3>
<p>蔣主席將親臨致訓</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據軍聞社訊：空軍參謀學校，定卅一日上十九時，在該校舉行第六期學員畢業典禮，蔣主席將親臨主持，對畢美學員致訓。屆時白崇禧·陳誠·周至柔等，　將參加盛典，京各大學校長　　邀參加，中干全體員生聚餐，下午舉行晚會。</p>
<h3>主席對美記者談話　美報著論表同情　謂我今日局勢原因複雜</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿九日電〕此間報界對蔣主席二十七日接見美國記者發表談話之反響，首見於斯克利浦斯，霍華德系「世界電訊」報，該報撰述社評題曰：「對中國之公平待遇」。全文如下：「蔣主席請美國報界對中國問題予以更較同情之考慮，實足令人長發深思。中國社會制度中谷種不平等之情形，在一旦全部呈露，且以西方之標準衡量時，自易對此龐雜國家之各種情形，獲得扭曲之觀點，當日本於一九三七年發動戰爭時，所謂中華民國僅勝於空洞之名詞，時軍閥控制各地，共產黨文控制其餘。自一九三七至一九四一年，中國單獨牴抗侵略，自一九四一至一九四五年國民黨治下之中國，乃由蔣主席之軍隊與日本軍隊相對峙，一九四五年戰爭維束後，美國立即要求蔣主席終止與共產黨之宿仇，其方法則爲成立國共聯合政府，使中國致於統一。在些項談判進行時，自無暇顧及其他政治問題。同時蘇聯於推出東北時，將東北轉爲共產黨控制之區域，而使國民黨之地位大受損害。今日中國之政治及經濟情形，較戰爭結束時更見複雜，其原因由於被聯之陰謀，美國之舉旗不定，以及中國之處理不當者，　　而有之、直至最近，蔣主席始能在國內自由決定行動、蔣主席對美國記者等申述美國在其　蕩共產黨之戰爭中亦有利害關係一節時，彼必抑制一勉強之笑容。美國對此種見解之瞭悟，雖屬較晚，然目前己獲廣大之承認，但不久前國務院曾堅持蔣主席需邀共產黨加入政府。」</p>
<h3>北塔山雪花飛舞　我軍俘獲偷陣蒙兵一名</h3>
<p>〔中央社駐奇台記者北塔山廿七日電〕（遲到）記者於謠言聲中，昨與騎七旅韓旅長來北塔山，寄宿於蒙古包內，深夜突降大雪，氣溫降至零度以下，今晨猶見雪花飛舞，北塔山之主峯阿勒吞臥巴，銀裝玉頂，迄立於雲天瀚海中，蔚爲奇觀·昨夜我軍曾俘獲偷襲我陣地之裝軍一名，奇台連日所傳蒙方增兵馬千餘，擬向我進攻之說，已於蒙俘口中獲得證實，記者今晨曾與韓旅長騎登阿勒吞臥巴山巔，俯視北山之烏拉斯台蒙軍陣地，雪後初啃，萬里在望，遙見蒙軍後方停有汽車六七輛，似爲昨夜開來者。據記者觀測，北塔山長約二百里，寬約五十里，山勢險陵，加以我軍之忠勇，必可粉碎侵略者之無恥進攻。</p>

<h3>聯總遠東區域委會建議　物資暫停運華北　黃災救濟事業亦將停頓</h3>

<h3>中政會今開臨時會議　研討對日貿易問題　國務會議明日提出討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國府委員會定一日舉行第八次國務會議，討論經濟改革方案及開放對日貿易問題兩大要案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕中政會卅日晨舉行例會，載傳賢主席，首由白　　，王世杰·兪鴻鈞分別報吿最近軍事，外交，財政方面槪况，旋討論開放對日貿易問題，並由張　報吿政院討論該案經過，當有多數委員發表意見，就開放與不開放兩方而之利弊，詳加研究，討論甚大，認為該案關係極爲重大，有另行集議之必要，當決定卅一日上午八時召開臨時會議，專門討論該案。卅日會中發表主張開放意見者，對於原定辦法亦有不滿，認爲可予修改。至認爲不必開放者，其所持理由，仍係循當前經濟情况，而有所發揮。又據悉：我出席聯合國安理會代表郭泰祺，因開會工作繁忙，積勞成疾，需要短期休息，政府特准其議假奏病，並派蔣廷　暫代其職務，亦經本日中政會決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕參議員武　煦頃對記者談開放對日貿易問題，渠表示不能贊同。據稱：日人於七七前即强調經濟合作，高呼農業中國，工業日本之口號，當時我國因不願作日本附席，因此未接受此項要求，後抗戰即起，茲中國已勝，日處於戰敗國地位，和約尚未締定，豈有戰勝國對戰敗國開放貿易之說。且吾人應知日本軍需工業之基礎，並未　毀，日所需者為鐵，鹽，棉各項重工業原料，如我開放對日貿易，此種原料則將源源流入日本，無異協助日本重工業之再建，其結果將首先危及我國，吾人根據過去經騐，即知日貨運華後，日商所到之處，其政治軍事力量亦隨之而至。武氏旋提出兩點可資注意之事實，一爲台灣，台在日之管制下，達五十年之久，現返回服國懷抱，迄今仍動　不安，一為東北在日佔領下達十四年，現東北人民生活困苦，不能安定，如日貨一旦開放，流至東北及台灣其後，果實非吾人所可設想，故吾人實不可貧圖一時便宜，而胎未來之患。武氏談及對日和約問題時，認為吾人應防止日軍國主義之死灰復燃，對日本　武思想之剷除，應實施再敎育，吾人應根據百年樹人之古訓，對日採百年管制，以收其效。至管制意見，武氏認爲有數點：（一）同盟國在日本，應設管制機構，（二）日本工業生產，應按照盟國管制辦法。（三）日本國內各項軍備，尤以武裝警察應澈底解除，（四）變相之軍事學校不能設立，武氏認爲此數點爲最低限度之管制條件。</p>
<h3>我商務團中止赴日</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕某工商界領袖表示：政府原定派遺之赴日商務考察團，因拖延過久，而其他各國之代表團，如英·澳·印度等，均已抵達日本多日，故已不擬前往。以對日私人貿易之恢復而論，應爲我國整個對外貿易之一部，因我國平時對此毫無準備，故工業界對此僅滿懷恐懼心理，而無建設性之對策。惟解決開放日本私人貿易問題，非消極反對所能了事，聞於本年九月間，上海·天津·廣州等各大商業中心，將推選代表，商討我國整個對外商務問題，此事不論由政府召集，或由民間自行發動，均爲必要之舉。中國如欲取得亞洲之領導地位，最理想之途徑，常然爲利用美國之資本與技術，但在目前之情况下，是否可能，尚有問題。另一途徑則爲在若干條件下，利用日本之技術，此點如運用得法，實有可能。至於有主張擴大中信局易貨範圍及數量，以代替開放日本私人貿易一節，當然亦有其見地，但今日民卞國家均主張自由貿易，我人不宜背此潮流。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日电〕國務院官員頃談稱：美國建議於八月十九日召開之對日和約初步會議決定延期舉行，何時舉行雖尚未議定，但正在討論中，日內即可決定。美國將向蘇聯提出關於此一會議之照會，照會之方式日內亦可加以決定。蘇聯之覆文曾主張由外長會議討論，美國此次照會殆將加以駁覆，但認爲或可以四强預先談論此事之方式出之，然美國決不改變其之塲，即遠東委員會之十一個國家必須參加對日和約之初步會議。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京三十日電〕澳外長伊伐特，頃在此間談稱：日本和約應在一九四八年初起草。並謂：澳洲將反對任何認爲該和約僅限由四國起草之建議。伊氏並未述及蘇聯之建議，即日本和會限於美·英·中·蘇四國。然渠强調稱：以澳洲之立堪言，遠東委員會十一國均須出席日本和約會議。</p>
<p>伊氏在設宴款待記者時稱：如由十一國舉行對日和約初步會議，則起草和約應無重大困難，僉信此會議可能在明年二月或三月中開合。</p>
<p>伊氏稱：對日本之和平解決並非長期棘手之事，應能在一九四八年初完成。事實上，其基本原則業已由遠東顧問會議議定，其後亦已由目前之遠東委員會予以承認。和約之基礎亦已由麥帥在日本之傳偉所奠定，蓋解除武裝現在實際上己完成。</p>
<p>記者詢以渠是否同意和會在日本城市如京都等地舉行？渠答覆稱：渠希望會議能在太平洋區中如舊金山或檀香山之類之地點舉行。記者又詢以是否無蘇聯之參加，則和約反易於締結？渠答稱：此爲微妙之問題，然據常情，應有蘇聯參加，而會議應採取三分之二多數表決法。</p>
<p>渠佔計盟國之監視日本，需要十年或十年以上。渠相信最有效之控制日本作戰潛力之方法，爲監視其進出口之貿易。</p>

<h3>社論　冷靜的思考，詳盡的調查！</h3>
<p>因爲前天首都中央日報披露了財政經濟兩部調査孚中揚子等公司經營進口結匯情形的報吿概要，在數字上漏了小數點，又被合衆社發電誤算了數碼，於是社會上又爲「豪門資本」起轟了。果眞有豪門資本存在，誰都願予以迎頭痛擊的，但冷靜的一想，如要憑這一則纒誤的紀載，就趕快放矢，恐怕未必能「中的」。請大家先冷靜的思考一下，並進一步要求政府或中央銀行調査公布自勝利以來因經營進口或共他而聲請結購外匯者之全部名單及其數額，以騐看「豪門資本」果在何處。</p>
<p>據中央日報所載兩部調査報吿，自三十五年三月四日至十一月十七日止，中央銀行共售出外匯三八一，五五二，四六一·一三美元，至卅六年二月一日止又售出二，〇一二，〇四〇·八〇美元，兩共三八三，五六四，五〇一·九三美元。若孚中共結匯果爲一億五千三百餘萬美元，揚子共結匯果爲一億八千餘萬美元，則兩家所得官價外匯達三億三千餘萬美元之鉅，將佔中央銀行全部售出外匯百分之八十七弱，其爲龍斷，百口草辨。可是事實竟非如此。昨據孚中公司董事長的談話，該公司僅結匯一百五十餘萬美元，而楊子公司啟事亦說僅結匯一百八十餘萬美元，兩共三百三十餘萬美元，持與合衆社電報所戰數額，相差適爲百倍，更麥閱南京中央日報所載原文，卽可知中央日報將末二位數字以前之小數點漏排，乃搆成此「放大百倍」之奇觀。我們就事論事，就調査報吿以論兩公司的結匯數額，似覺「豪門資本」的勢力竟非如外傳想像之大，因爲他們僅得外匯總額百分之〇　八七，不及百分之一。試問今天上海那些規模較大的公司或進出口商行，他們的資本，他們所握有的外匯，豈僅此區區之數？然則豪門資本究爲誰何所有，實在是值得注意的一個問題。</p>
<p>現在財經兩部旣調査孚中揚子等公司而發表報吿，我們甚願當局秉此方針，繼續澈査中央銀行一年半來或抗戰以來所有售出外匯的全部名單及其數額，好讓國人都能知道究竟那幾家「豪門」——包括富商大賈，享受到國家的恩惠，集積優越的資本。至少這一年半之間，還有百分之九十九的進口貨外匯，中央銀行究竟售給那些商行？——中國商行還是洋行？這纔是「尋求事實」應有的手續。</p>
<p>最後，我們主張一切事——包括經營國際貿易，應大家平等，反對有特殊階級的存在，不問這特殊階級是中國人或外國人。我們尤其要鼓勵中外商人站在平等地位做一切生意，可是不能因爲中國公司或商行自己經營進出口，就隨着洋商們之後，也來看不順眼，動輙加以打擊。總之，我們希望將事實一切公開，我們更須憑着眞正的事實，作冷靜而客觀的判斷。</p>

<p>自社魯門總統任命魏德邁將軍爲特使，來華調査中國局勢眞相後，一般人士，以爲此殆為美國即將改變對華政策之先兆。就是美京的華盛頓郵報，據美聯社所傳消息，也於一昨著論，認爲　德逃將軍的東來，可能將爲美國對華政策改變的徴象。該報又謂，此項對華政策的改變，已於六月廿八日解除對華軍火輸出開其端。究竟美國對華政策是否即將改變，此權操在美國政府和人民之手，我們不欲有所論斷；但從歷史的眼光來論，我們認爲美國的對華政策有其一貫的傳統，自門戶開放政策的宣布，中經華盛頓會議的召開和九國公約的簽訂，以迄由於史汀生主義的宣布以至太平洋戰爭的爆發，美國對華政策在根本上是一貫的：就是維護一個統一强盛的中國出現。海約翰時代而有門戶政策的宣布，爲的是什麼？爲的是維護中國的統一。及至第一次世界大戰吿終，日本稱霸東亞，而美國有華盛頓會議的召開，爲的是什麽？爲的是維護中國的統一。等到日本撕毀條約，建立偽「滿洲國」，而史汀生國務卿有史汀生主義的宣布，爲的是什麽？爲的是維護中國的統一。因爲美國的一貫政策在維護一個統一强盛的中國，此與日本的侵華政策相衝突，終而引起太平洋戰爭。美國的此一政策，實與中國的民旅願望相合，因而我們看見有中美兩國靑年的比肩作戰，所以美國這一對華政策是經過了血的洗禮的，我們不相信，也不願見，此一對華政策在大戰甫經結束不久，而國際局勢益形不安的今日，會有什麼改變。</p>
<p>不過政策是一事，政略又是一事。政策不變，政略却每因時代環境的不同，而有所更張。縱觀美國自立國以來，它的對外政策有三：對美洲，我們看見有門羅主義；對歐洲，不締結任何具有勾結意義的同盟；對遠東，門戶開放。此三政策，稱成美國對外政策的全部。這三個政策是不可以動搖的，無所謂改變的；但爲實施此三政策，政略上却每因時制宜而有必要的更張。對美洲的門羅主義，由於近百年來局勢的演化，已與門羅總統當時的含義不盡相同。聯合國機構的發起和積極參加，並不曾與不締結任何具有勾結意義的同盟政策相抵觸；我們不能說因爲美國的參加此一機構已改變了不與任何國締結同盟的傳統政策。在遠東，情形亦復相同。</p>
<p>美國本是西半球的國家，但自美西戰爭以後，美國已變爲一個遠東國家。第一次世界火戰以後，美國已一躍而爲世界一强，就是大英帝國所不肯放葉的海上覇權，也與美國以五·五　三的比例平分了秋色。等到第二次世界大戰以後，美國是惟一本土不曾這受敵軍侵占破壞的國家；到如今，它在事實上已是今後世界的希望，它領導着世界。然而自第二次世界戰爭終了以後，美國對於如何領導世界，直至最近，却不曾有明確的表示；因而世界各處都發展着與此次作戰理想相背的局勢。由於近五十年美國的發展，美國對於遠東本來是很關心的，它有傳統的對華政策，倘使它能够認眞執行，遠東的局勢，特別是中國的局勢，也不致有像今日的局面。造成此局面的，不是美國對華的沒有政策，而是此一政策的不曾强調實施。</p>
<p>所以今日而言美國對華政策，我們所期望的不是政策的改變，而是如何加强此一政策的實施。美國對華的傳統政策是在維護並支持一個統一强盛的中國；如何執行此一政策，卻有各種不同的方式。在第一次世界大戰後，我們看見有哈定總統的召開華盛頓會議，邀請九國與會，重申了門戶開放政策，就是維護中國的領土與主權的完整和機會的均等。此在當時，尤其是日本與我有所謂二十一條密約簽訂的常時，實不失爲一種明智的舉措。九一八以後，日本在東北建立「滿洲」僞國，在當時的情勢下，而有史汀生主義的宣布，要亦不失爲一種明智的舉措。然而史汀生主義的宣布終解決不了遠東問題，日本反而加緊對華侵略，終而引起了十二月七日的珍珠港事變及由此而起的太平洋戰爭。</p>
<p>美國對華旣有其傳統政策，而戰後出現在中國的局勢，論其根源，又與雅爾達不可分離，此在美國更有其道義上的責任來加强它對華傳統政策的實施——維護並支持一個統一強盛的中國。這個政策在今日中國局勢下應該怎樣表示出來呢？在加强對中國人民所擁護，同時又爲列强所水認的合法政府的援助，以全力來支持這一政府。更具體地說：是在將杜魯門主義及馬歇爾計劃實施到中國，遠東來。共匪已自絕於中國人民，中國人民及政府正在動員全國的力量來戡亂；中國的人民正以最大的決意，將此民族的毒瘤予以革除。只有在此爲中國人民所擁護的政府下，纔能有一個統一强盛的中國出現。如前所述，美國的對華政策與中國人民的願望，不謀而合；所以美國對華政策的加强實施，不僅關係美國本身的利益，抑亦足以滿足中國人民的願望。</p>
<p>我們於此更要指出的就是國與國的關係，我們應該出以遠大的眼光；不能讓一國的大計爲若千只岡獲得近利的人所影響。此輩目光短近的人，他們往往將他們的視綫局限於一隅，禾能作統盤的打算；此其結果，就是他們打算獲得的近利，在一個較遠的角度下，也將變爲不可能。美國已是一個領導世界的國家，它只能向前，不能退後。它將知何担負起這一責任，不僅關係中國的前途，抑且關係整個人類的命運，我們願美國的政治家能及早為明智的決定。</p>

<h3>英工黨內閣動搖說不確　艾德禮獲信任票　組織聯合內閣絕無其事</h3>
<p>英為應付今冬經濟危機或將裁軍</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅日電〕下議院今日以極大多數通過對艾德禮首相之信任票，首相係因最近報端出現要求渠辭職之通吿，而要求信任票。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅日廣播：英首相艾德禮今吿工黨領袖稱：鑒于英國內經濟情形之日趨嚴重，英國將减輕其在德，義，希等國之軍事義務。當時有詢以巴勒斯坦方而英軍是否亦將减少者，英首相拒不作答。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅日廣播：艾德禮首相今日宣稱，渠反對組織聯合內閣、以應付英國當前之經濟危機。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫教卅日電〕艾德　首相今日向國會工黨議員解釋應付全國經濟危機方案後，政府發表公報稱，議員表示完全滿意，並保證一致　　首相採取其所認爲必要之各種措施。方案詳情雖未公布，但艾氏下遞將在下院加以說明。先是·據消息靈通人士稱，首相　將要求全國礦工每日額外工作一小時，俾得增加煤斤產量。今晚渠將與礦工聯合會領袖會晤。</p>
<p>〔聯合肚倫敦廿九日電〕負責方面今日消息，英國爲應付今久經濟危機起見，或不免出於裁兵一策，此舉對於英國在世界之地位影響甚大。同時內閣或得決定動用二十五億六千萬元黃金及美金準備。外間又傳艾德禮總理將宣布改選國會，或請保守黨加入組鄉聯合政府，惟官方對此已予以否認。艾氏今日在下院答復議員質問稱，「余見某報對余戴有驚人消息，此實完全不確」。關於英國兵力，在本月初，陸海空三軍共有一百二十九萬七千名，參議總長蒙哥馬利在遠東考察，旣己決定提早趕回，或將向內閣提出裁兵方案。美金借款在十二月間即將用　，馬歇爾援歐計劃，又須暹至明年一月始能由美國國會提付討論，目下巨對派保守黨及擁護政府各報日以經濟危機爲言，絕非無的放矢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕陸軍部某官員本日談稱：對於蒙哥馬利元帥突然決定返國事，此間將加以密切注視。據稱，英國軍額如有任何大量裁减情形事，或將影響世界防務之整個情形。美國與英國在地中海方面，仍負有共同責任云。</p>
<h3>美衆院組特委會　赴歐亞調查經濟　委員十九名八月間出發</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華雄頓廿九日電〕衆院議長馬丁（馬薩諸塞州共和黨議員）頃宣佈任命一項衆院十九名代表組成之特別委員會，於八月間離美赴歐洲與遠東調査當塊經濟情况。</p>
<p>此項委員會將由衆院共和黨外交委員會主席伊賴率領。衆院議長於宣佈此項任命後，即發表談話稱：「國會需要儘量搜集歐洲與遠東情狀正確之精報，同時需要身處其境者最正確之論　。職是之故，吾人特任命一項特別委會赴歐洲與遠東視察，並在國會二次會議時報吿。按二次會議已定明年一月間舉行，繼馬氏談話後，伊賴稱：爲討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之發展起見，國會或將提前於「十月初」重　。特委會將於八月廿七日赴歐洲。該會調查計劃尚未公佈。據悉，在國外時間已定五週。該會工作將與衆院軍隊服務處與外委會密切配合。蓋後二者亦計劃國外調査事宜之機構。特委會中外委會代表佔四名</p>
<p>特委會名單</p>
<p>特委會共包括共和黨議員十一名，民主黨議員八名，被等並代表衆院內十六個常設委員會。共和黨議員：伊頓（新澤西州）；赫特（馬薩諸塞州），仁金斯（沃海華州）；伍維頓（紐傑賽州）；安德遜（明尼蘇達州）；蓋斯（南達各塔州）；坎凱爾（本雪凡尼亞州）；浮萊斯（沃海華州）；維塞爾（依里諾州）；麥西（紐約州）；聶克桑（加里福尼亞州）。民主黨議員：科爾瑪（密西西此州）；里却斯（南加羅林那州）；華特（本雪凡尼亞州）；柯萊（北加羅　那州）；馬恩（塔薩斯州）；克露克斯（路易西安那州）；科克（絲約州）；蒙連尼（奧克拉荷馬州）。</p>
<p>特委會任務</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國衆院議長馬丁業於今日任命伊頓為歐洲與遠東復興問題國會特別研究委員會主席，伊頓膺此新命後宣稱：國會特別委員會將於八月廿七日離此前往倫敦、設置總辦事處，其下將分設五個小組委員會，開始研究歐洲各部情形，各小組委會之研究範圍，劃分如次：（一）研究英國及其自治領地之財政情形；（二）研究歐洲農業與收穫之整個情形；（三）研究法國，比利時，荷蘭及盧森堡四國之情形；（四）研究德國與奧地利之情形；（五）研究義大利，特里埃斯特，希臘之情形。（六）伊頓並已任命衆議員赫特爲該會副主席兼總務主任，伊頓因健康關係恐不能親赴歐洲，一切由赫特主持云。伊頓於提及中國時談稱，遠東之未來繫於美國及中國。美國如能協助中國臻於工業化，則爲歷史上最偉大之進步之一。伊氏並謂，朝鮮目前情况之悲慘與危險，乃世界史中所未曾有者，但伊氏對此器，幷朱予以解釋。</p>
<h3>英將撥鉅欵　發展殖民地經濟</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕英國殖民事務部大臣瓊斯本日在下院宣稱；英國在今後十年內，將以三萬萬鎊之經費，撥交各殖民地，用以發展其經濟，英國現以派遣若千代表團前往各殖民地研究發震殖民地之生　問題。</p>
<h3>英王儲婚期　約在十一月中旬</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿九日電〕據英國王宮內人士吿本社訪員稱：英國備君伊麗莎白公主與蒙巴頓上尉之婚禮，將於十一月十八日在威斯特　斯特寺舉行，但在樞密院於下月一日開會前，尚未能正式宣佈行婚日期。十一月十八日一　乃國王喬治本人所提出，衆料樞密院當將遵從國王之意願。</p>
<h3>印澳相繼向安理會建議　請調處荷印爭端　英美反對採取激烈措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里卅日電〕印度政府已已於今日致電聯合國安全理事會主席、提出印尼之危機。該電原擬於昨日送出，係循英政府之　而展延一天。</p>
<p>〔路透社康白拉卅日電〕澳總理齊夫萊吿衆議院稱、澳政府已令其駐聯合國安全理事會之代表霍格森，促聯合國機構注意印尼局勢，澳洲對於荷屬東印度之發展深爲關切，蓋該地之情形，已咸脅澳洲戰後之和平發展，故已訓令駐成功湖之代表，儘早向安全理事會提出此問題。余意以爲英埃問題，旣尚有合法有效之條約存在，不妨稍擱，吾人在印尼則已而臨實際之戰爭，此項衝突之拖延，後果實無法估計，因此余已決定請聯合國機構干涉此一爭端。澳洲或將先於印度提出此事，吾人認為此乃決定性之重大事件，不容片刻遲延。澳洲就此事會與共和邦諸國經常接觸，已獲聯合主國之鼓勵齊氏並曰：澳洲不久將以紅十字會用品供給印尼，飛機若干架，將撥作此用。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務院某官員頃談稱：對於印度要求聯合國採取行動，使印尼事件得以和平解決事，美國「或將」加以支持。但渠鄭重指出，此言並非即爲美國必將支持印度所稱各節之謂。此間認爲印度或將要求聯合國，在進行較爲溫和之措施前，採取較英美兩國所願支持者更爲强硬之行動。英美兩國對印尼事件交換意見後，一致主張採取迅速行動，但否認英國或美國擬向聯合國提出此案。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙廿九日電〕此間官方頃否認某通訊社所傳中國曾建議調處印尼爭端之說，謂中國並未提出此項建議。惟官方證實中國政府對於華人在印尼之安全曾表示關切，荷方已知覆中國政府，吿以業己詳細訓令各荷軍司令，嚴密保護華人之生命財產。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞三十日電〕荷軍今日發表戰報稱，荷軍兩棲部隊已在蘇門答臘北端附近發動新戰事，進入富庶農業區。另據日　方面消息，荷軍今日拂曉自拉望向南十五哩之馬朗推移，該地薄暮恐將陷落。</p>
<h3>僑委會召集會議　商緊急保僑措施　一致主張派兵前往荷印</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕荷印戰事爆發後，僑胞生命財產慘遭損害，僑委會對此極爲重視，經一再與外部籌商，向荷蘭政府提出要求切實保護我國僑民，廿九日該會委員長劉維熾與外部於行政院政務會議時，提請通過撥發荷幣一百萬盾，爲緊念救濟之用，卅日該會復召集高級職員會議，研討保護荷印華僑問題，一致主張政府即派兵前往保護，並請加撥二百萬盾，以作緊急救濟，並於卅日在該會召集有關機構會商切實緊急保護華僑措施。</p>
<h3>反對設立巴爾幹監察團　蘇聯行使否決權　美聲言將採進一步行動</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿九日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日在安全理事會中，使用否決權，反對美國所提在巴爾幹設立邊疆監察委員會之議。當理事會就該一建議案逐章交付表決時，葛羅米柯靜坐一　，未有行動者達半小時之久，故各理事猶以爲蘇聯當不致使用其否決權。不料葛氏最後突然使用共否決權，使業已通過之序論章等，悉皆被　棄。蘇聯在安全理事會中使用否決權，比已爲第十一次。</p>
<p>事後美代表詹森建議延會，以使各代表得就此一「極度嚴軍之事態」，向本國政府請示。英代表勞編附議詹森之議，安理會遂宣吿於標準時間星期三下午七時（上海時間星期四上午四時）復開會議。會後美代表詹森宣稱，美國並不因蘇聯之使用否決權而認此事已告結束、否決權之速用，並不能變更巴爾幹之局勢，美政府當儘逮視實際情形，向安理會提出下一行動之建議。强國之濫用否決權，以破壞大多數之意志，可能鼓勵巴爾幹之滋事份子。巴爾幹特別委員會以及安理會之大多數委員及理事，咸認希臘北部之局勢，嚴重咸脅和平，故蘇聯之行動業已造成嚴重之局勢，聞各主要國代表團均巳請示本國政府，以資應付此一局勢。在葛羅米柯使用否決權之先，阿爾巴尼亞南斯拉夫保加利亞三國己通知安理會，聲明不能接受設立巴爾幹邊疆調査委員會之議，其申述之理由如下：（一）希臘動亂之眞正原因，係內部原因；（二）聯合國憲章不允安理會對獨立國家行使控制權，（三）憲章亦未允許安理會得以强迫他國接受其建議案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕今日據悉：蘇聯在安理會對於美國建議設立半永久性視察團監督希臘邊境一節運用否決權後，此間官方現正覓求新行動新資應付。美代表詹森已奉國務院命令召回華府。以備諮詢。可能由希臘出而個別邀請安理會理事國派遺視察員前往監視，聞英美兩國現正加以研究。但壚權威人士明白表示，美政府毌寗主張在聯合國機構以內處理全部希臘事件。美朧戰將根據希阿南斯保等國糾紛已　　亂世界和平地步，故聯合國機構必須採取斷然行動爲理由，向安理會提出若干新方案。</p>
<h3>世界盆腔行贊助　馬卿援歐計劃　行長麥克洛埃宣稱</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿九日電〕國際復興開發銀行董事長麥克洛埃本日稱：該銀行將運用其資源，遵照國務卿馬歇爾之計劃，配合巴黎會議所決定之歐洲經濟合作。麥克洛埃力言：該銀行對於復興工業計劃之政治方面，並不發生關係，該跟行所關切者爲刺激一般之生產，蓋因無論何處，皆以恢復貿易爲首要之事。</p>
<p>渠稱：又因國際銀行所接到之貸款申請書，大多數以需要煤斤爲理由，故該銀行將密切注意英美代表將來在華盛頓討論增加魯爾區之煤斤產量。同時，國務院宣佈，參加魯爾區產煤問題討論之英專家等將於本週來離英，下進初可開始商談。或問：印尼之戰事，對於荷蘭之申請貸款事，有何影響。麥克洛埃稱：此一申請乃在戰事發生以前所提出。渠指出：貸款之批准與否，取決於經濟之基礎，銀行對於印尼所發生之一切，並不採取任何立場。荷蘭曾請求三年經濟開發計劃之貸款，但借款數目與詳細情形尚未完成。</p>
<p>世界銀行發表　資產負債報告</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日電〕世界銀行今日稱：該行己將一九四七年六月卅日止之資產負債表交四十四會員國政府，該報告說明該行之資本，共十六億零四百九十萬美元，共虧九十三萬八千六百四十七美元。</p>
<h3>美駐希代表團　草擬一年計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典廿九日電〕美駐希臘代表團領袖葛里斯伍爾德頃在此間招待記者會上談稱：代表團今在草擬中之計劃雖僅以一年爲限，但吾人所作之工作在時效上將超過此期限。關於處理希臘預算案一事，該案雖已自四月一日開始，但今爲適應代表團之一年任務，現已延長爲十五個月。</p>
<h3>希召開軍事會議</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿九日電〕希臘各陸軍司令定明日在希臘北部之伏洛開會，由參謀總長范蒂科斯將軍主席，以討論最近剿匪以後之一般局勢。英駐希軍事團團長羅林少將，美駐希軍事團副團長萊納將軍亦將與會。</p>
<h3>英召集四國外次會議　美法蘇接受邀請　俾就德國問題交換意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卄九日電〕外交部發言人稱：蘇聯業已接受英國政府之邀，尤於今年十月初在倫敦舉行四國外次會議，討論德國問題。英政府之請東係於三星期前同時送達華盛頓，莫斯科及巴黎。蘇蘇為首先正式表示接受之國。</p>
<p>觀察家認英美就德境英美區未來經濟狀况所進行談判之發展，表示成立四强關於統一德國經濟之協定，希望仍極淡薄。蘇聯之接受邀請參加，已先行保證莫斯科之不因四强之未能就歐洲經濟合作之基末間題成立協議而認定十一月問在倫敦召請以討論德國問題之四强外長會議，將有所變更。自貝文—皮杜爾—莫洛托夫在巴黎就馬歇爾援歐計劃舉行之談話發生破裂以來，外界即盛傳十一月間之外長會義將無法如約舉行，故蘇聯之允諾參加四國外次會，具有相當之重要意義。英政府致其餘三强之邀請書，並特別指出四强外長代表根據前莫斯科外長會議之指令，應行處理下列三問題：（一）準備對德和約之桯序；（二）德國之政治機構；（三）聯合國在德權益之賠償。此外復指出莫斯科會議曾要求柏林盟管當局提出有關若干經濟問題之報吿，此等報吿是否將向十月間之四國外交會抑逕向十一月之外長會議提出，現尚未悉。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕官方正式宣布，國務院業已起草覆文，表示接受英國之邀，允諾參加十月一日在倫敦舉行之四強外次會議，以討論德國問題。發言人謂覆文尚未最後通過，惟不久即可向倫敦提出。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕法國政府對於英國之邀請四國外次於十月一日在倫敦集商德國問題，雖尚在考慮之中，然其表示接受，殆己不成問題。此間人士並信蘇聯之接受英國此一邀請，己使因拒絕參預馬歇爾計劃而關閉之門戶，重新開啓一都份。</p>
<h3>歐洲合作委會　加緊調查工作</h3>
<p>調査表送往　境各佔區</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕十六國歐洲經濟合作會議之合作委員會　開會，　決將　已送　十六國會員國之調査表，立即送　德境四强佔領軍總司令。合作委員會主席英國弗闌克稱：合作委會執委會今日下午業已決定將內容相同之書面問題送遂德境四張　司令，此項決議已經合委會一致通過。法國外交部經濟司長亞　芳經推選爲秘書長，義大利之特萊諾里尼及瑞典之哈馬斯柯爾特，則被推選爲亞爾芳之助手，其任務在綜合各會員間之答覆，　制歐洲經濟狀况之　後報告書，以　於九月一日以前向馬歇爾國務則提出。十六國會員國以及德境四佔　區，至　應於八月三日午夜以前，提出對書面問題之答覆。所提　　之內容，雖尚未宣布，惟就　　據之一般性指示備忘錄觀，可知德境管制黨局應提供今後四年內德國之鋼鐵產量及所需煤斤之數字。</p>
<h3>蘇收集匈境德資產　英美向蘇提抗議　蘇欲與義樹立更緊密經濟關係</h3>
<p>〔路透社偷敦廿九日電〕英外部發言人稱：英政府就蘇聯已在匈牙利收集德國資產，作爲賠償之舉，已向蘇聯提出抗議，此項照會己由英駐蘇大使彼得森向蘇政府提出。波茨坦協定及匈牙利和約雖已先後規定在匈之全部德國資產，應作爲對蘇聯之賠償，然英政府認爲在對匈和約正式生效以前。尚不得遽即收集此等資產。聞美政府亦己向蘇聯政府採取類似之行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿九日電〕義外部可靠人士稱：蘇聯駐義大使凱斯蒂萊夫業己向義外長史福薩建議，派遺義經濟代表團赴莫斯科，與蘇進行經濟談判。凱氏向義外長表示蘇聯之希望兩國建立更緊密之經濟關係，並聲明蘇聯對於批准義和約之態度，乃爲須待義議會自行批准和約以後，四强始能彙存對義和約之批准書，以使和約生效，預料史　蘇外長明日可向義議會宣布蘇大使所　之各點。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿九日電〕義外部發言人廿九日談稱：義外長史福薩廿七日接見蘇大使凱斯蒂萊夫時，會吿以義政府希望批准對義和約，並吿以義大利之參加巴黎會議，並無反蘇之意。該發言人否認報間所傳凱氏曾表示蘇聯不贊成義國之行動、並謂未曾提及此一問題云。</p>
<h3>匈籌備普選　四黨組職合陣綫</h3>

<h3>港賑災游泳選美會　吳丹鳳當選香港小姐</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕半月來，香港好像在雨季中渡過，可是昨天（廿七日）天却網開一面，整天放出太陽來，於是「籌賑中英水災游泳選美大會」如期舉行了。地點在海軍游泳池，時間是下午三時開始。</p>
<p>去年的香港小姐李蘭，是在麗池選出的，眞的，無論是參加競選的小姐也好，競衆也好，跟去年的瘋在情形，相去太遠了。不過門券每張是十元，聽說銷去一千張，所得善款倒不少。</p>
<p>游泳節目在選美之前，有十四個游泳秩序來襯托，裏面包括了兩個軍人表演秩序，（原定四個，只舉行了橡皮救生艇及救生表演兩項）算是有點看頭。　不過游泳對抗節目，却太平淡了，好幾個秩序，只得三個人參加，競爭情緒，完全不高，算是有成績的：劉帝炳以六十秒奪得百碼自由式冠軍，與及羅地威（英空軍）在優美表演下，獲取百碼仰泳冠軍，其他絕少精彩鏡頭。</p>
<p>水球對抗末一幕是水球對抗，香中對軍聯，雙方競爭激烈，結果是四比四戰和。</p>
<p>惹人觸目的香港小姐競選，在水球對抗賽前舉行，原定報吿參加的是十八位，可是臨塲競選的，出人意外，只得四位參加，幸虧臨時得何秀嫻及陳安妮加入，於是香港小姐，就在這幾位當中產生了。</p>
<p>呼聲最高的黃莉莉，竟然放棄參加，惹人戀念。</p>
<p>等待小姐化裝是一件悶人的事，何况是香港小姐化裝，六位小姐在更衣室裏，千呼萬喚始出來。</p>
<p>繞池一周候選小姐行列，依次出塲，但是身材碩美之何秀嫻（八號）爲首先導，（廿號）的黃安琪居次，順序便是（廿一號）白麗連，（廿五號）吳丹鳳，（廿九號）朱麗妍，（四十二號）陳安妮壓尾。</p>
<p>繞池一週，嬌步喘喘，觀衆報以掌聲，露天台上，軍樂悠揚，環行至評判席前，反覆迴旋，以待十之位中西裁判員的評定。</p>
<p>香港小姐結果：吳丹鳳以三百五十九分營登香港小姐寶座，臨時參加的陳安妮得第二，朱麗妍獲第三。最後，由海軍司令麥佛烈准將發獎。　香港小姐的履歷，吳小姐是廣東順德人，一二十歲，高五·一尺，身重一〇三磅，是一位有興趣播音的姑娘，她希望自己成爲一個歌唱家。陳安妮和朱麗妍，是舞女，朱小姐却是上海人，還有的尾聲，便是影片公司想找香港小姐上銀幕。</p>

<h3>上海油商業籌備組織　食油運銷聯營社</h3>
<p>以華東之雜糧易取華北食油</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市油商業同業公會因鑒於本市食油運銷供應，時感短細，而一般雜糧供應，頗感充裕，惟華北各地則反是。爲調劑彼此盈虛，平準兩地食油糧食供應計，決組設上海食油運銷聯營社，並於昨日下午三時，在本市民國路三七七號油商公會，召開第一次籌備會議。出席會員二百三十餘人，社會局專員干四民，科長吉明齊，亦出席指導。首由油商公會理事長張超叙述聯營社組設動機，略以本市及華北各地糧政卞管當局，對聯營社機構之組設，亦認爲頗屬需要，遂及時產生。旋由干四民吉明齋分別致訓詞，甚望在配合國家經濟新措施下，努力合用，調　華東華北之民食，同時達成貨暢其流之旨。最後推定張超，徐志祥，楊明周，湯文態，李賦元等十七人爲籌備委員，定日內召開籌備委員會議，共商推進事宜，並草擬聯營社組織章程，大會延至六時卅分散會。</p>
<p>據悉：該一聯營機構，將定名爲上海市油商業同業公會食油遝銷聯營社，資本總額大致定爲國幣十億元，參加社員出資額，每單位最少一百萬元，最多五千萬元。將來營業路綫，將以華東區之雜糧，包括麵粉，苞米，蠶荳，高梁等，易取華北各地，包括天津，營口，靑島等地之食油及其原料云。</p>
<h3>買方逢高脫手　華股又呈頹勢</h3>
<p>華股昨不進反退，若干家經紀人，自下月起，有罰金停業兩星期之訊，且夫當日票據不能抵用之說更盛，活動派紛紛斬多，而少壯派亦乘勢力售，近午終吿不支，除雜牌股尚有平穩者外，各熱門股十分　廢。</p>
<p>長開時，僅現勤興稍升外，餘者咸開低盤，開後遞永紗更經一〇四號二二三號七六號八五號紛紛了結，迫低至二三三元。一六〇號一五四號一七一號一五七號買進，略有微升。八五號二二三號七六號一四三號一〇〇號四號二二四號再賣到二二九元。</p>
<p>九時二十分後，經一八〇號一七一號九七號二一八號一七四號進至二三五元外，而一九號二二三號四號一六〇號八五號仍售，自十時迄十時二十分，形成拉鋸者殊久·盤旋至十時二十五分後，一六號一五四號四五號五〇號一二號俱進，一六〇號出後覆進，遞永紗曾回漲到二四〇元光景，一五七號二二號八五號一五二號二三一號一四二號二一九號仍加了結。</p>
<p>十一時四十五分後，永紗回降至二三〇元光景，一五二號一六〇號一五五號一七二號　意不怠，一八五號一五二號再來力售現永紗，爲狀仍見不支，次熟各股每况愈下，跌勢慘厲，尤以小股華豐，因傳一〇七號將放棄管理之訊，慘瀉更多。</p>
<p>臨收前，現永紗跌至二二二元，遲永紗跌至二二五元低價，而後以二二三元及二二六元之價收市。收後二二二號八號三二號賣出，喊價稍疲，結果較前收即交股，計勤興微升，永紗新華小挫，景福中法永公各跌半成光景，美亞新光跌一成不到，華豐信和挫一成，國貨交易不多而仍平，五和內衣大通麗安火柴中紡景綸所跌甚微，商務中絲統益榮豐各跌半成至一成弱不等。</p>
<p>遞交計華豐永公跌一成弱，永紗信和美亞景福新光跌半成强，塲外各老股升降俱微，而平和者亦復居多。</p>
<h3>九福製藥　新股上市</h3>
<p>證交昨在市塲揭示三則：（一）市塲營業時間，自即日起改爲上午九時起至十二時，星期六同。（二）九福製藥新股亦定今日起上市，成交單位暫定一萬股。（三）第六一號經紀人代理人陳言，擾亂市塲秩序，罰令停止入塲二星期，至八月十二日止。</p>
<h3>統債挺秀　外股軋跌</h3>
<p>公償昨日以西文報紙對我國債劵還本頗有非議之論調，人心復有蠢動，統丙自八八〇〇元開後竟狂升至一〇三〇〇元高價，而後稍有回落。五五五室有供，三六〇室及大成與潮帮等均納，結果較前收計甲乙升七〇〇元，統丙漲九〇〇元，統丁好起六〇〇元，統戊亦漲八〇〇元，成交約三百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨稍不振，紙業及像皮股均見回跌，洋商及銀錢業有納，說券帮散戶有賣。怡紗晨開八〇五〇〇元高價八三三〇〇元而後稍盤，結果較前收計業廣電話俱平，怡紗會德豐航業鋼業微挫，英聯怡　各跌半成，紙業獨瀉一成。</p>
<h3>棉紗布續疲</h3>
<p>昨棉布客銷仍呆，福建帶等反有賣出，大戶鑒於環境不利，頗少活動，故檯面全係散戶進出居多。兼聞經濟警察大隊，將於八月一日起開始行動，致人心極呈盧軟。龍頭細布由四三萬一千元回至四三萬四千元收市，比昨日軋降二千元，其餘色布士林等無何軒輊。</p>
<p>棉紗昨紡建照例開售，市勢初開即疲，旋以各方需要閑散，價乃遂漸吿退，惟上落微細。再因設劵等物價回跌頗多，市氣亦頗帶軟。二十支輕磅，由一〇七五萬元退至一〇六五萬收市，軋降廿五萬元。其餘亦小十廿萬元不等。</p>
<p>現棉軟弱</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况仍疲，人心不振，同業咸以紗布疲軟，客戶爭售下，脚地甚軟。紗廠進意毫無，故交易沉寂，各檔做開棧交價計L．S．S．二一六萬，沙市二〇六萬，靈寶二一五萬，漢細一九三萬一九六萬，彰德二〇〇萬，周浦籽花三三萬三千。</p>
<p>棉紡公會希望　紡調撥還墊款</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，於昨日召開常務理事會議。會議經過，對輪管會輸入限額分配處第二一兩季外匯配棉之收購及代紡部份各紗廠墊付價款甚鉅，希望紡調會援照原議，對於已結匯墊付部份，（共達國幣六千餘億元），迅即撥還，俾資週轉，其未結外匯部份，希望政府直接處理，以維對外商契約信用。關於棉紗議價問題，亦曾提出討論，僉以非實行機動議價，並顧及再生產成本，則整個棉紡事業，將無法生存云。</p>
<p>紡建配紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡調會聯合配紗，共配五九六件，全部配予廠商，申購單共九十七張。</p>
<h3>紡管召開最後一次會議　商討處理結存資金　總數有一千餘億元之鉅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部前紡織事業管理委員會，已定於今日下午四時，在市府召開最後一次會議，討論該會前辦理收購棉紗時，配銷後結存資金一千餘億元之處理問題，以資結束。　在前行政院末院長任內，政府對各廠存棉所紡之棉紗，收購半數，然後將配銷後所得　額價軟，積存充作發展全國棉紡事業及推廣植棉之用，當時並成立基金保管委會。紡調會成立前後，前紡管會曾迭陳經濟部請示該項基金之處理辦法，惟迄未獲批覆。茲爲早日了結此案，該會特於今午召開末次會議，討論如何處理云。</p>
<h3>內地津帮紛起採辦　食米一致上漲　粳秈均見上升三四萬元</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共計到米糧三千餘石，市况以內地津帮採辦，價格飛升，申方人心激昂，追蹤上騰，粳米狂漲三四萬元，秈米猛漲二三萬元，白元陰一元均見騰昂二三萬元。北市去化較活，漲風重起。</p>
<p>麵粉內地北運，申地亦漸轉動，繼續上漲三四千元。麩皮胃呆平定，豆餅初開尚緊，終以實銷淸懈，欲漲無力，午時仍居平局。黃豆步砌三五千元，菉豆供求兩少，形居高定次呆之狀。赤豆兎起　落，回低三五千元。蠶豆連跌之後，來貨漸减，另化略動，漸趨回甦之象，轉升二三千元。</p>
<p>生仁南洋活跳，暴漲二三萬元，紅糧求過於供，續挺三五千元，苞米亦隨各物挺升，回高三五千元。</p>
<p>油市外埠消化不勁，本街納胃動而不旺，惟貨主堅挺，生油豆油淸汕蔴油菜油一致提升二萬元之譜。</p>
<p>社會屆趕辦　工廠等配米</p>
<p>昨日米市突起波動，市情一致上漲，民食調配委員會吳主任委員爲謀平抑米價起見，特於昨日令飭調配會，對各工廠學校及其他團體申請配米，速根據申請各戶名數額，先行配給，然後再予審核，以便申請各戶，即可獲得配米，免受米市價波動成脅。</p>
<p>運華物資中　食糧日益少</p>
<p>頃據行政院善後救濟總署發言人談稱：最近聯總運華救濟物資，食糧一項已日見减少。上年度曾以米麥曁雜糧佔多數，本年度將以交通器材及晨業用品佔首位。上週廿一日至至六日止，聞該署在本市分發各種物資，食糧一項總數僅及四十五噸，其間亦以交通器材及農業器材爲多，共約八千四百餘噸。燃料更少僅十六噸，總計上週該署分發本外埠各類救濟物資，共爲一萬八千八百零四噸。</p>
<h3>洋松下疲</h3>
<p>洋松因來源續到下疲，杉木雖產地成本不廉，惟時屆夏令，市價難以　　。</p>
<h3>棉織業產銷聯營公司　經濟部執照已到</h3>
<p>惟政府準備貸放之款尚未撥付</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國棉織業產銷聯營公司，自獲得政府之扶助後，業已按照公司預定計劃，逐步展開業務。該公司於日前，業由經濟部正式頒到公司執照第四二二四號。聞該公司擬計劃在麥帥開放日本對外貿易前，以公司所有各種產品，向南洋各地陸續推廣，以爭取國產棉織品在海外原有之市塲。惟常前之困難，仍有二點：（一）政府準備貸放之棉紗原料及加工資金，迄今仍未撥付，致公司所屬各廠，無法進行生產。（二）聞南洋各地棉織品市塲，目前多爲英美印出品所佔有。在價格上，國產品似處於不利之地位。</p>
<h3>人造絲回疲　廠經依然沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲呈盤旋局面，終比上日挫落二十萬元。一二〇號高山及旭字等有光，上午二千四百五六十萬元，最小四十萬元，下午最後爲四百五十萬元，同行稍有做開。綢廠帮納意甚淡，交易甚稀。</p>
<p>昨市廠經依然寂靜，各級高勻度只有喊價而無成交，中級另擔昨成交價二千七肖五十萬元，高另擔二千八百五十萬元亦有做開。干經二十八分另撥一千七百五十萬元亦有成交，不渦數量甚　，絲廠長吐昨有二十擔成交，八月份交貨價做五百〇五萬元。</p>
<p>昨市網貨眞絲徒面初挺後回，結果比上日火四五萬元。華强貨開市一千〇七十萬元有成交，嗣後即降至六十五六萬元之間，復經大戶拋售，不支再挫，最小到五十二三萬元。多方竭力拉提，乃又回高至六十萬元成交。然因供求失衡，遂致再度下降，最後爲五十四萬元，隔日期五十七萬元。大誠貨開市後七十二萬元有成交，後做六十五萬元，最後成交即期便爲五十九萬元。大誠格子璧縐開市喊五千五百元，後五千二百元有成交，最後喊四千八百元，其餘各貨，均平穩無變化</p>
<p>大宗人絲　由日運到</p>
<p>日本人造絲頃有大批運到，存於海關食庫等待査騐。據記者獲悉：此項人造絲即將全部檢騐完畢，出中信局運存倉庫，預計下月初句可以開配，至配售價格，現尚未決定，中信局與代售方而連日均有商討，配售之技術方而，亦在研究改善中，以防有流弊發生云。</p>
<h3>銀行公會取締　票據當日抵用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會，近奉財政部令，以一般行莊，近常循各客戶之請，對當日解進之票據，有予以當日抵用週轉之便利。結果造成信用膨脹，且在銀根緊俏時，行莊因票據當日抵用關係，往往對自身運用頭寸之數額，亦未能先事匡計·致萬一抵用票據發生退票時，常易動搖行莊白身之安全。故票據當日抵用之舉，應即予査飭取締。茲銀行公會已於日前分函各會員銀行査照云。</p>
<h3>國行通函指定行　指示結滙三要點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行頃以第一〇七號通函，分發各指定銀行，略稱：據報各指定銀行間有在未經開立不能取銷之信用證，或委託購買證，及未提供進口貨全部貨運單據以前，憑輪入許可證先行結匯情事。如果屬實，顯與本行上年十月二日所發第五十六號通函之規定抵觸。用特提示三點，</p>
<p>一·指定銀行結售外匯時，必先審核申請人是否備具左列條件之一：</p>
<p>（一）進口貨物，係在輸入許可證規定範圍之內，並確能於三個月內抵埠，經開有不能取銷之信用證，或委託購買證者。</p>
<p>（二）貨物業已抵埠，而具有全部運貨單據者。</p>
<p>二·指定銀行務須依照輸入許可證所規定者切實辦理。</p>
<p>三·輸入許可證如有修正或補充條款，須憑輸入臨時管理委員會有關部份主管人員簽章，方爲有效。</p>
<p>指定銀行如有違背上項規定者，應受處分。</p>
<h3>糖市平穩</h3>
<p>昨煻市趙勢平穩，上落無幾。公會劃盤，二〇中砂百爲五十六萬五千元至八十元，答赤袋裝五十六萬五千元至五十七萬元，二四粗白千包，七十萬元，汕包六十三萬元，四半白六十六萬元至六十六元五千元，三半白無貨，均見回好，汕　陽青四十二萬元至四十一萬五千元及四十一萬元，棉赤四十五萬元。興化白高五十八萬元，次之五十一二萬元。興赤四十三萬五千元至四十三萬元，共成交三百餘件。</p>
<h3>呢絨賣買閒散</h3>
<p>呢羢交易昨頗閒散，專批生意因秋冬貨喊價　續升高，兼敵實銷尚屬有待，同時爲本月底銀錢業透支契約期滿，銀根不鬆，零星門莊生意，因夏銷相繼落伍。棋盤街及長樂茶會上，呢羢市區具無起色。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易稀</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市交易依然寥落，良以本市出口商，大都仍忙於辦理最近運銷　洛哥之九百噸珍眉綠茶，致買氣咸懷　　，而其趨勢，則以貨方態度　靜，乃均與隔日相仿。至於連日去化蟬聯之各種內銷茶，在炎熱中，脫手仍極活潑，且尤以低檔紅茶，無錫一帶需要益切，價格方面，因賣戶堅持，一致巍站有勁。</p>
<h3>杭絲綢業　申請貸欵</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日電〕絲織綢織電機業，爲發展生產，請准四聯總處發給生產貸款一一〇億，以救濟渠等之資金週轉。又杭市絲織產銷聯營公司，亦繼滬之後，正積極籌備中。</p>
<h3>民營用煤配價　日內又將調整</h3>
<p>新任燃管會主任委員張希爲，昨日離滬赴京，出席經濟部召集之煤斤增產會議。本市民營用煤分配會議，將待張主委返滬後，再行召開。聞民營用煤配價，將再度予以調整。惟各公用事業配價，決維特原價，絕不變更。經濟部以上次調整配煤價格，影響公用事業上漲，故對燃管會貼補仍予繼續，飭令對公用事業配價，必需維持原價云。</p>
<h3>全國水泥工業申請　優先配給燃料油</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據全國水泥工業同業公會稱：各水泥廠燒製熟料之旋窰，現多燃用柴油，每月所需，爲數甚巨，以往各廠用油，皆賴亞細亞，美孚，中國石油等公司配售，供源已感不足。今後若不優予配給，各廠因燃料不繼，均將瀕於停頓。全國水泥公會，鑒於水泥爲重要國防工業，戰後建設繁興，水泥需要激增，政府各當局，無不一致寄以重大期待，其重要性實不在公用交通等事業之下。而各廠對國家所負之義務與責任，尤非普通一般情形可比。如無鑒足燃料，何能以增加生產，輔助建設。爰於昨日，由該會副總幹事奚正修，往謁柴油分配委員會鄧主任委員，及吳秘書等，面陳該業特殊困難情形，並提請求兩點：（一）水泥業用油，請顧念國計，特予優先配售。（二）各廠以前向油公司訂售柴油，除請核准照舊供應外，不足之數，請予照配，以維生產，鄧主任委員已允注意辦理云。</p>
<p>開該會上海，中國，江南，華新，四川，天祥，順昌，建亞等八會員，每月共需柴油八千零五十噸云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕水泥工業去年備受洋貨傾銷之打擊，今春因政府限制輸入，銷路漸趨暢旺。各廠爲儘量供應各方需要計，近數月來，均在積極增產。現下全國產量，已較年初增加倍蓯。江南華新等廠，年內亦可開工。預計明年春季，國產水泥且可外銷南洋。乃最近水泥銷路，重趨疲弱。各廠出品，多已供過於求。其最大原因，當在建設性工程，多歸停頓。日前盛傳某方擬請求准許日貨水泥進口，該會全體同業，現正密切注視，如屬竟有其事，則爲國民經濟及水泥工業生存所關，定將誓死反對云。</p>

<h3>從莫斯科會議談起</h3>
<p>— 長松譯</p>
<p>譯自一九四七年七月號讀者摘</p>
<p>對德奧和約的基礎，雖然早在大西洋憲章，德黑蘭，雅爾達和波茨坦各次協定曁聯合國憲章臺面，已經奠定，但是具有決定作用的莫斯科會議，原爲擬訂對德，奧和約而召開，結果，甚至連締訂這些和約所應依據的原則，也不能獲致協議。</p>
<p>這次會議確實所做到的，是把俄國與西方國家的目的作了一次決定性的試騐。而這個試騐證實了：戰時的聯盟固已使戰爭獲勝，但却不能締造和平，遂使世界不得不伴留在前途渺茫與困頓挫折的境界裏。</p>
<p>這次僵局的原委，現在已經編寫在歷史上了。戰時的各種協定建議設立一個已被解除軍備，淸除納粹主義和民主化了的德國，它的部分領土必須割讓，政治上實行地方分權，經濟上組織分散，但依然是一個政治儷體與經濟單元，它從剩餘的工業資本設備中交付賠償，但它仍能不賴外力的協助而生存。戰時的各種協定還建議設立一個獨立自由的奧國，享受被解放瞋家的待遇，特別免除它作賠償的交付。</p>
<p>美國和英國在莫斯科會議中，想憑藉一個民主的德國，來實現這些目標。這個德國是由多少具有自治形體的各邦所組成，歸一個權力極有限制的聯邦政府所統治——使這個德國在不作過分工業發展的條件下，足够維持它業己增加的人口，因爲過分的工業發展，也許會使它再度威脅歐洲的和平。美國爲表示它的善意起見，提出了一個空前的建議，就是四强訂立一個長期同盟，使德國的武裝繼續被解除，藉此以保障全體的安全。法國對於這個方案的意見十分接近，使西方國家達成了幾乎一致的團結。</p>
<p>俄國則和美英的立塲大不相同，它對有關德奧兩國的戰時協定加以否認；它還想以新的條件加諸戰敗國和它勝利的盟友身上，它貶評薩爾煤區的加入法國經濟單位，認爲是「支解」德國、，同時它卻堅持其本身與波蘭兼併德國耕地的近四分之一，並且極力主張把那個地區內的人民驅入德國的殘部。影響所及，西方國家將被迫去重建德國的工業，並促進它的輸出，甚至和它們自己的輸出業相競爭，或者西方國家必須自己化錢來養活德人，否則的話，祗有讓它挨餓，把它推入共產主義的懷抱中了。</p>
<p>同時，俄國堅決主張，德國要按照目前的時價，賠償三百億美元以上的物資，其中的大部，要從現時的生產中取得，賠償總額的一半歸屬俄國。這無異就是說，西方國家爲要生產這樣多的剩餘物資，必須先出資本來建立德國的工業，然後讓俄國　獲得賠償的方式，將這個工業一把掌握在手裏。</p>
<p>俄國並主張設立一個高度中央集權的德國，做傚俄國的典型，不但由獲得多數的政黨來統治，而且要由共產黨支配下的工會和通常習見的『民主』與『反納粹』的共黨綫組織來統治。</p>
<p>俄國在它勢力所及的範圍內，奪取所有名爲『德產』的奧國資財，它想藉此來保持它在奥國的有力控制權。它以阻撓對奧和約的擬訂爲手段，來達成它在維也納和在整個巴爾幹的「交通綫』上維持駐軍的目的。</p>
<p>俄國的條件，是一個不折不扣的統治歐洲的計劃。它的野心，已使它與西方間築起了一條鴻溝。現在德奧問題的嚴重優局，決不是這條鴻溝存在的唯一的象徴。</p>
<p>巴爾幹方面顯然也有同樣的鴻溝存在。因爲俄國在戰時，雖然曾經嚴正地担保給予解放的歐洲一個根據民意選出自由政府的機會，但它現在正把巴爾幹國家，變成可能的蘇維埃共和國。</p>
<p>這條鴻溝也明顯地在波蘭。波茨坦會議所保證給予波蘭的自由選舉，竟變成了一幕民主的假戲。而俄國羽翼下的盧布林集團，甚至把一個遵從多數民意的政府的假面具也丟棄了。</p>
<p>鴻溝也明顯地在中國。俄國保證以軍事上與道義上的支援，專門給予國民政府，以換取中國在美國的慫恿之下讓與俄國的權益，但現在它已把這項保證丟向九霄雲裏去了。</p>
<p>鴻溝也明顯地在朝鮮。原來的計劃是扶植朝鮮成爲一個獨立解放的國家，但俄國使朝鮮繼續分裂着，還想憑藉比在德國所用更爲明顯的方法，置朝鮮於它的支配之下。</p>
<p>原子問題的僵局裏，鴻溝也顯然存在。美國建議在適當的保證之下，交出原子彈，共同管制，但是俄國先後一致地予以拒絕。在聯合國的工作中，鴻講也自存在。俄國運用它的否決權和拒絕參加各種附屬機構的工作，幾乎使聯合國組織發生麻痹，在俄國竭力拖延國際警衛力量的組織時，也顯然有鴻溝的存在。</p>
<p>總而言之，上述種種是從全世界普遍一致的模型裏塑造出來的，而這個政策的模型，已完全和安全沒有什麽關係。它的決定，顯然是由於兩種主要的衝動力——俄國傳統的帝國主義，及一種瘋狂的共產主義。後者看準蘇聯以外的世界都是敵人，並料定世界革命終必爆發。確實的，俄國不但在追求和它戰時的保證相違背的目的，而且每當可能的敵人示弱的時候，它的野心就比例地　張起來。</p>
<p>俄國在領土，政治，與經濟上的收穫，已經是任何帝國在任何戰爭之後所獲得的最大的了，但是俄國仍未　足，繼續進行它的擴張計劃——如在德，奧使用外交和軍事的壓力；在東歐利用傀儡政府；在希臘與中國進行其滲入工作，第五縱隊和內亂；以及故意阻撓和平建設的每一種努力。如果有意使世界繼續沉淪在干戈擾　與經濟艱困的情况中，以待實行共產主義的時期成熟到來，那末，這眞是最好不過的政策了。</p>
<p>當今的局勢，　顯露着一綫希望。就是俄國不但沒有作戰的能力，而且它不願戰爭，這是完全可信的事實。經騐告訴我們：俄國在遭遇眞正的抗拒力的時候，是會讓步的，譬如伊朗和特港（特里亞斯特）這兩個例子。假使西方國家要設法打開目前僵局的話，機國這種策略上的彈性，必須是西方政策應該把握住的一點。</p>
<p>西方國家的政策，必須根據三項基本原則。它們必須同意塡充空隙，以杜絕我國進一步的擴張勢力，因爲現在的均勢，已達如此微妙的階段，要是再有一個團家向俄國的優勢降服的話，也要很容易地會引起歐洲大陸國家作一面倒投向俄國的結局。其次，西方世界必須設法把本身和一切願意加入的國家組織起來，共同爲和平，貿易與繁榮而努力，同時不放棄現在　幕後面的國家。因爲西方唯有　　這個方法，才不但可以使自身獲得清償的能力，而且可以向俄國誇示加入我們的利益。最後西方國家，在政策上，對於俄國一切合法的利益，必須予以愼重的考慮，以避免過分的敵意、因爲這種敵意將會引起危險。</p>
<p>根據這　的一個政策，現在的僵局還有打開的希望，俄國與西方也還有充分餘地，以獲致協議，爲它們的共同利益而合作。而且，維護聯合國和天下一家的概念的最大希望，也唯有寄託在這種政策上。</p>
<h3>訪問一位科學發明家　好萊塢憧憬中國舞</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>好萊塢航訊</p>
<p>幾個月以前的一期「觀察業誌」上某位老敎育家曾經大聲疾呼：「如果我們美國的敎育界，不能駕御好萊塢，那，我們全美的，便要被好萊塢吞沒」！今天美國學校的學生，署電影比聽課有興趣得多，電影的無形的敎育，不但超過學校敎育的影響，而且勝過父母親苦。婆心的家庭敎育的實效。十五歲的小孩子。能够拿手搶殺人，而且把殺人的痕跡　滅。八九歲的小女孩子，在馬路上，也居然把屁股一　一　學南美洲的跳舞。二十世紀福斯公司的老　碩納克說，「好萊塢的影片，打敗了軸心國，今後，擺在好萊塢人士面前的責任，是如何贏得和平？如何憲設一個永遠沒有戰爭，沒有警恨，和沒有餓餓的新世界」！</p>
<p>拉安脫夫婦</p>
<p>我把這些問題，向一位好萊塢上的「臥龍山人」請敎，一位科學家，文學家，也是藝術家的天才，吉勃特，拉安脫，他住在漣　片片的太平洋邊，一　美麗精緻的小洋樓，建築在海邊山麓上，朋友澇蘭帶我去見他的那天，我們先在太平洋岸的一家鄕村酒家吃飯，許多美國的有閒階級，從幾十公里外開車到這裏，吹一點海風，然後在這裏度他們的「週末」。那晚，拉安脫和他的夫人，也恰巧在座、我對他的影象，是一個「謙謙君子」風度的大漢，講話非常乾脆有力。</p>
<p>他是Sonovox的發明者，我不知道中文應該怎樣　譯這個字！「助聲器」，或者「電動傳聲器」，大槪就是這樣一個意思。據拉安脫說，大約十多年以前，他就注意到這個問題，他看到很多啞吧不會說話，心中有無限同情。他說：人的聲音的產生，有兩個來源，一個是聲帶振動所發生的「聲」，聲經過喉，經過「口腔」裏的齒舌唇等等變化，便產生「音」，音是不同的，聲是一樣的。如果一個不會說話的啞吧，因爲聲帶壞了，無法振動，他的「助聲器」便可以用人工發聲。那是一樣二一英寸長的電振器，放在喉咽頸之間，緊貼着皮膚，使他振動，影響到「聲帶」的振動，啞吧祇要用口齒舌唇做各種姿勢，聲音便跟常人一樣出來</p>
<p>拉安脫太太替他丈夫作表演，然後，他自己解釋這其中的原理，我說：原理很簡單，但要發明一件東西，其中的細節目，就決非「外行」人所能了解，他的機器，現在在芝加哥大量製造，他說：美國有六百萬啞病的人，至少，有一部份人，可以得到很大的帮助。</p>
<p>電動傳聲器</p>
<p>電影傳聲器，現在正慢慢應用到電影上來，特別是神怪的影片，或偵探片，恐怖片，一個人可以用狗吠的「聲」講話，（加上人的「音」，（也可以用狂風怒吼的聲普講話。把狗吠或狂風怒號的聲昔灌成留聲機片子，留聲機開動的時侯，通到電器上，再用電綫結到傳聲器上，便有了這種聲的振動，拉安脫太太表演的那天，聽來確有點不寒而慄。</p>
<p>廣播台上，已經營遍地採用「電動傳聲器」，那是用來廣播兩種融合的聲音。我看見一本廣播週報上，大大的有歌頌拉安脫的文章。</p>
<p>其實，拉安脫並不是眞正從事科學的人，我們說他科學家；不如說他『作家』來得更適切。他住在黃金世界的好萊塢上，大部份以靠寫電影劇本生活，他是靠寫作致富的人，雖然，他說：他痛惡資本主義的社會，但是，他有一個相當『富』的家庭。</p>
<p>我們天南地北，談了一大套間題，他有談話的天才，因爲思想敏捷，所以有許多不平凡的意見。他說。生存在同一個地球上，人和動物，原來沒有分別，但是，後來，所謂動物，祇知道用自己的四肢來運用或亨受物質，人能使用物質，使物質變成工具，然後用工具再來啓發另一物質，因此，人就戰勝了動物，成爲菓物之靈」。</p>
<p>他舉出很多南美洲非洲怪動物的名字，許多動物幾乎和人一樣，能站立走路，能有自己合羣的社會，但是，無論如何，不能運用物質，變成工具。</p>
<p>拉安脫從來不進敎堂，他是一個思想曠達的『懷疑論』者，但是，他並不否認道德和敎育，他對電影事業發展的趨勢，並不像那些老敎育家們那樣悲觀。他說　：這是一個人類的智　的進步，電影事業積幾十年發展到今天，我們不能再倒退回來勸靑年人不看電影。至於劇本內容的取材與選擇，他一爲是一個非常扼要的主題。</p>
<p>他平均兩個月可以寫一個戲本，劇本也同樣要請『經紀人』推銷到影片公司。此外，他也替廣播電台寫東西，廣播事業和電影事業，在好萊塢上是一對賺生兄弟。</p>
<h3>中美電影事業　需要密切合作</h3>
<p>好萊塢大約有幾十家廣播公司，都是大規模大塲面的。歌王平克勞斯貝的收入，電影的佔一小部份，廣播與灌片，佔大部份。我在好萊塢匆忙中，也參觀了好幾家廣播公司，裏邊有大規模的樂隊，有各種歌唱的塲面。</p>
<p>中國人在好萊場從事廣播工作的很少。在電影技術方面，却有一位驚人的天才『姆王』，我不知道他的中文名字叫什麽？三天之間，我打了十多次電話給他，但是都沒法會到他，他現在在華納公司任攝影師，好萊塢上的人說起『傑姆王』，人人都翹起大姆指：『攝彩師中的第一把交椅』！</p>
<p>我沒有會見孫瑜黎莉莉他們一行人，大約我離開洛杉磯不久，他們就到達了那兒，但是我衷心期望他們：能够眞正的奠立一點中美電影合作的基礎。記得去年十月間，在紐約碰見鄭用之先生，鄭非常用勁的說：他反對用『電影合作』幾個字，當時我對他的一番意見，頗表懷疑。這次到了好萊塢，我更堅信：中美兩個之間的電影事業，需要合作。</p>
<p>合作非倚賴</p>
<p>合作並不全是依賴，我們的設備，技術，落後得太遠，如果說：我們需要建樹中國的電影事業，我們便得虛心的向好萊塢學習。過去一二十年來，不但合作得不够，甚至連一點合作的基礎都沒有，所以才造成好萊塢上種種輕視中國的錯誤觀念。哥兪比亞的製片人凱尼黛，請了一位中國演員當主角，受到多方的責難。華納公司，二十世紀福斯公司拍了許多有關中國的電影，用高鼻予，藍眼睛的『洋人』化裝。好萊塢上有世界各國來的戲劇人才，爲什麼沒有我們中國來的？固然，中國演員講英文戲，有語言文字的困難，但這不是一個無法克服的問題。當今美國第一流女明星殷格立勃克曼，『聖瑪利之鐘』的主角，生在瑞典，長在瑞典，剛到美國的時候，什麽英語都不懂，後來靠一位家庭敎師的補習，加上牠自己的勤學，現在不僅在銀幕上，對話流利得和美國人一樣，而且這次在紐約公演話劇，今年三月間的戲票，去年十一月就預售一空。</p>
<p>除了股格立勃克曼以外，巴西風騷女郎卞門蜜蘭黛，也是一個例子，牠剛進好萊塢的時候，祗會議巴西流行的葡萄牙話，此外，便祇發個英文單字現在不但能演任何對，而且能唱傳神的英文情歌。爲什麽我們國內的第一流演員，不能透過中美電影合作的方式，推　到好萊場來？不能到這世界舞台來一顯身手？爲什麽我們老讓那班華僑演負，在好萊塢以代表中國者自居，專門演那些司　，聽差，以及黃包車夫一類的脚色？</p>
<p>中國的舞蹈</p>
<p>我在好萊塢的某一天傍晚，幾位美國朋友約著在「德般」咖啡廳晚餐。有位美國電影界中人說：他從來沒有見過中國的舞蹈，他問：中國以前到底有沒有「舞」？另外一位美國人說：中國有漢刺和唐朝的「宮庭舞」，他看到過圖畫，圖畫的塲面很偉大，但是他從來沒在戲劇和電影上看到過！</p>
<p>我並不是說華僑演負們的技藝不够，實際上，他們也處處想宣揚一點中國的藝術。但是因爲了解中國太少，他們的作風，多半仍是西洋社會的。美國觀衆所需求的，不是要一個黃種人演他們那一套，而是竭望着一點眞正的中國人的　劇和藝術。</p>
<p>國際了解和國際合作是一點一滴堆砌起來的，決不能讓旁人在精神上渺視了中國的後，再舐吮旁人可憐的施捨。就說好萊塢罷，這兒就是一個國際大舞台的縮影，好萊塢一張彤片給世界人士的印象，不會淺於一篇外交官的演說，不會輕於一位作家的一本名著，我們在國外，有英文說得流利的外交官，有英文寫得暢達的作家，有各種各樣的講英文的工商百業的代表，而我們獨獨忘記了好萊塢，那麽重要的一個敎育和宣傳機構！</p>
<p>滲透全世界</p>
<p>好萊塢五十年前，還是太平洋濱沒有被人注意的荒村。八十年前，據說是遍地沙漠，飲水要從山上細流汲取，如今，幾十年間，變成了世界平面面積最大的都市，變成了全世界享受最奢侈，最高貴的都市，洛杉磯的市政專家，預言五年以後，人口可以超過紐約。他們已經在設計修造最現代化的馬路，沒有交叉，沒有紅綠燈，而且是四條平行的大道。十多年沒有地震了，好萊塢人相信不會再有天災。交通方便了，他們十七個半鐘點，便可以飛到紐約。多少大企業家，他們從紐約飛到洛杉磯，又從洛杉磯飛回紐約，他們控制著這宣傳的神經中樞，他們影響著整個世界的年靑人！</p>
<p>我在洛杉磯好萊塢住了九天，初春暮冬，好萊塢街上，一片歌舞昇平的本色，穿長脚褲的女郎，啍西班牙的情歌，滿街是：五步一棕　，十步一芭蕉，靑葱翠綠，看不見隆冬的蕭條和肅殺。我在「卞洛」夜總會消磨一個熱鬧的黃昏老闖一但尼凱」，被許多男女包圍著，他從前在電影界好幾年，「玉堂富貴」中的送牛奶的孩子。有人說他是一個不可捉摸的人，電影界剛剛成了名，他老兄又忽然不幹了，合夥幹這夜總會！</p>
<p>夜總會，酒吧，咖啡會，餐室，在這紙醉金迷的天堂，看不見憂愁，看不見煩腦。全世界的汗血金錢，在滋養著好萊塢的繁榮，好萊塢的無形的影響，一點一滴，滲透到全世界！</p>

<h3>肺病療養法（中）</h3>
<p>— 吳紹靑</p>
<p>（乙）早治易愈遲治無效</p>
<p>健康檢査，就是實行這個原則，也許你會懷疑醫師的診斷。因爲你沒有一點病狀，自覺和常人一樣，這是錯誤的觀念。有許多人患肺病，而無絲毫自覺的病狀，若須等待病狀明顯，大都病已到達相常的程度，恐不易醫治，縱或可治，亦必需費較長久的時期，更重大的手術；所以若經檢査出有肺病，不可因循有且，希圖徼倖的心理，或暫爲觀望，等待病狀發現時再醫，恐等到那時，侮已晚矣。——早期的肺病，十人中約有八人可治得好，晚期的肺病，十人中至多不過三人可治得好，——治病如救火，幸勿因循自誤！</p>
<p>（丙）旣有肺病應如何辦法</p>
<p>無癆防癆，有癆治癆，這是天經地義的話。同爲一種肺癆，但有性質不同，輕重不同；病灶的部位不同；所以處理的程序也就不同。治療的方法不同，以及所需時間的長短也不同，這要醫師據X光片，以及其他檢査的結果，配合起來，作一個病理審定，然後採擇適當治療的方法，在此應向病家忠吿者，約有兩點。（一）擇醫治病，須走正路，循正軌，不可抄近取巧，存「姑妄試之」的心理，以爲「打針吃藥」可以奏功，至目前爲止，尚沒有一種公認的特效藥品，耗費金錢事小，而錯過治療的時期，則甚爲可惜。（二）旣擇定醫師，則必須忠實地服從醫師的指示，通力合作，務求治療澈底，不至功虧一簣。</p>
<p>（丁）幾件禁忌的事</p>
<p>（一）不可行灤呼吸運動，</p>
<p>（二）不可行日光治療；</p>
<p>（三）不可打太極拳；</p>
<p>（四）不可爲廣吿藥品所眩惑，以及試用其他不科學的治療方法。</p>

<h3>生之原理</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>陳立夫著　正中書局三十三年八月版　全書三〇七頁定價五元</p>
<p>一般人因爲陳先生是中國的政治家而覺得他在實際政治工作方面的質獻大於他在學術方面的創造。現在中國人對於別人的評價可以分爲兩種不同的立塲：一種是屬於Spranger所謂實用型的入們的立塲；一種是屬於所謂理論型的人們的立塲。實用型的人估計人家的工作要看他對於國家社會實際的建設有多大的貢獻，他們不會了解別人在學術上的貢獻。理論型的人在中國往往以爲自己是超然於實用世界之外而自命淸高，所以無論當一個在學術界有地位的人參加實際的工作，或一個參加實際工作的人尋求學理的基礎之時，這般超然的理論家祇是一方面無視於他們的實際工作，另一方面又忽視着他們在學術上的價值。其實，這種把實用和理論分爲兩截的態度是一種最不好的現象。我們覺得從事實際工作的人而沒有理論的背景，他祇是一個機械的工匠，而那般自封於象牙之塔的哲學家們與現實隔絕也無非是一種高級的奢侈最而已。中國的古訓說：「太上有立德，其次有立功，其次有立言」。中國人原來做學問一貫的作風是求其「內聖外王」之道。做學問一方面對於自己的內心做一稱修養涵蓄　的工夫，對於貢獻於國家社會奠定一個從事於實際工作的理論基礎。撇下專門學術的研討不談，專就做學問之道而論，我們比較的景慕梁漱凕和張君勱先生而比較的不重視純粹的理學家和道學家們（即純粹談理學和論道的朋友們。）對於陳先生的看法，我們以爲他是屬於前者而不屬於後者的。陳先生者唯生論和生之原理，他那種以懦家的傳統而接受科學經騐的學術精神，這在中國學術界是不可多得的。無認他是應用這種學理來做他的政治生活的背景，或是他在政治活動中追求這樣一個最高的原理，這都不足之以咸低他在中國學術思想上的貢獻。</p>
<p>陳先生在他的「生之原理」中包括了他全部哲學的體系——從他的本體諭，宇宙論，到他的人生觀和社會觀。本文限於篇幅不能作一個全盤的檢討。我們祇能作一個簡單的介紹和提出一點原則上的商榷，至於尃門哲學內容方面的評述，祇好留待以後再談了。</p>
<p>作者的研究是從現實社會出發的。他說：「此次戰禍蔓延之廣，流血之多，犧牲之大，可調空前未有。……這使每一個愛和平，愛正義的人不能不竭其思慮以尋禍患的根源，更要研討究竟在人性的深處有無可以永遠杜絕戰爭的端倪之可能性存在。……作者深信全面的進化是人類生存的安全保障，共同的生存是人類進化的中心標的，唯有在全世界人類能共生共存的條件之下，才有共同而迅速進化的可能。至於局部的獨生獨存，祇是全面進化的障碍，永久和平的咸脅。集體中有不和不平的因素存在，和平的基礎是無法鞏固的，戰爭的禍患是不能杜絕的。」</p>
<p>現在我們在他的體系中把幾個重要的綱領勾描出來，　　　以　一斑、</p>
<p>（一），他接受『變的原理」，宇宙萬物是一個繼續不斷之流。一開始他就引用孔子贊易的幾句話說：「易其至矣乎！生生之謂易，一陰一陽之謂道。變動不居、周流六虛。」</p>
<p>（二）他不承認在這個流變的宇宙之外另有一個不變的本體。本體即是在這個流變過程中的精蘊，它的屬性即是生，所以宇宙的本體即可名之爲「生元」。它本身不是心，也不是物，而心與物是它所顯現的兩方面。心是生元的動勢，物是生元的靜勢。動即發揚，靜即收斂。一切宇宙流　之所產生就在其一動一靜之際，一　一　之間。</p>
<p>（三）宇宙本體是一也是多。就在這一　一　之間起了變易，產生宇宙萬物。在整個宇宙的演變中大體可以分成功無機物，生物和人類三個階段。在每個階段的存在物自有其特性而不可混爲一談，因此，宇宙本龍可以說是多元的。但是這三個階段是同一個一宇宙流變過程的三個梯層，都是生元的顯現。所以宇宙本體也可以說是一元的。</p>
<p>（四）人的特性是（甲〕自覺反省，他能考慮過去，預測未來；（乙）道德生活，他有仁愛，正義，容讓，尊敬的德性；（丙）藝術欣賞，他有超現實的想像力，向未知的領域探險，尋求理想</p>
<p>（五）人生當爲社會服務，因爲欲爲己必須爲人，爲人即所以光大自己生命之意義，再進一步，當再求盡仁愛之性以使人與宇宙生命合而爲一。在人的生命中潛伏着一種向善的可能性。由於這種向善的可能性（陳先生稱之爲「誠」）而表現爲智仁勇三德，然後再經過格物，致知，誠意，正心，修身，齊家，治國，平天下八個步驟，以盡己成物，求自己人格之完成與他人人格之完成。</p>
<p>（六）社會歷史之演進是在全體人民共生共存共進化的動力下追求人生眞善美的最高境界。人類社會的進化可以分爲三大階段；（甲）人和默爭；（乙）人和人爭；（丙）人和自然界爭，最後的目的是一個世界大　的境界。</p>
<p>（七）中國歷庭文化可麓是人類全倡文化歷史之一貫性的東搬。中國文化的轉質是：（甲）以民生為中心而婦於行仁；（乙）以大間為極則而本於至公；（丙）致中和而成於力行；（丁）尚禮義而發於至誠·這也是世界文化最高的境界。這些特質在中國遺未充分的發揚光大。所以我們嘗前的責任一方面是在中國發揚這個文化特質，另一方面還要求其責現於整個世界。這纔可以說得上「爲天地立心，爲生民立命，爲往聖繼絕學，爲萬世開太平」。</p>
<p>本書體系證明明，思想清晰，而文字淸脆可愛尤其餘事。深值青年一讀。其間在原則上有幾點願意提出來和作者商榷的。</p>
<p>第一，我們覺得作者建立這個哲學體系是從倫理學的立塲出發的。這就是說，他先有一個倫理的信念，然後在他的這個信念上樹立他的體系，這和近代西洋哲學史上從笛卡爾，一直到康德黑格爾，叔本華，尼采，在無形問脫不了基督敎信仰的牽制樣。例如作者用的「生」字便浸透在倫理氣氣之中，因爲這個「生」字在作者的心目中下面貫澈到無機物，上面包括人類的一切精神活動在內。　使我們純就「生」的狹義來解釋，那末無機物是「無生的」，而精神活動是「超生的」了。又如「誠」，他說是生命的原動力，這頗有玄學的意味。誡有宇宙之誠，人人　，萬物之　。這是把限於人類活動，有道德意義的「誡」字應用到無所謂道德現象的宇宙萬物。</p>
<p>第二，作者研究的方法與其說是經騐論的，勿　說是直覺　，這也是因爲作者研究的出發點是倫理的。作者思構的力量非常豐富。他的主旨是由於他在人生體騐上有所證見而而生的，而不是由於分析目前經騐的事實入手，（如英國的C．D．Broad和美國的C．Lewis）也不是從純理智的立塲作邏輯的分析入手（如我國之馮芝生和英國的McTaggart）。評介者本人是比較贊成經騐分析法的。</p>
<p>第三，本書談社會進化史觀的時候很少應用現在西洋社會學和社會哲學的材料，我們以爲那裏面有很多資料是可以支持作者的理論的。作者在本書二六六頁列出一個人類進化各階段簡表，特別提出生存方法之進步及政治制度之演進，兩方面恐怕也覺到這一點。我們覺得作者這一方面還能多所發揮，來完成他的社會哲學和政治哲學。</p>
<h3>科學家奮鬥史話</h3>
<p>— 張豪</p>
<p>Grove　Wilson著　曾實葹譯·生活書店版</p>
<p>是歷來的科學家把我們帶進了這個近乎傳奇的世界，在現在，一切不可想像的自然力量被他們馴服了，並且利用了，一切不可思議的規律定理被他們發現了，並且解釋了。科學家們不但替我們創造了一個嶄新的世界，並且因此完全地改變了我們的生活方式，使人類的生活由艱苦走到舒適，由消極變到積極。由自然的奴隸轉變到自然的主人。科學家創造並且解放了人類。</p>
<p>但是，却沒有一個科學的發現或發明是出於全偶然的，也就是說，沒有一個科學家的成功是不經過無窮的奮鬥過程的——不論是對自身和外界的門爭。見科學家們的無可比擬的舊鬥精神，替我們後人開闢了一條平坦的大道，使我們更舒服地享用。爲着景仰歷來科學家們的百折不回的舊鬥精神，並且量緊要地，爲着給以後的一切科學家們一個勉勵和借鑑，無可懷疑，「科學家奮鬥史話」這本書籍的出版是有着他偉大而且光輝的價值的。</p>
<p>「科學家奮鬥史話」是用極淸麗的文筆寫成的傳記文。因爲是以每個科學家爲中心而敘述，所以比別的任何科學書來得更有趣。並且因爲是以時代的前後來敘述，所以同樣可以當作西洋科學發展史來看。所以，更正確地說來，這不但是許多著名科學家的傳記，並且也是一本有趣的西洋科學史。</p>
<p>這本書裏面述及的大科學家主要地有廿八位，從有史以來歷史上第一位科學家退利斯起一直一直到現在猶在的愛因斯坦爲止，這裏面有數學家，有動物學家，有化學家，有物理學家，生物學家，天文學家……包括了一切自然科學家，但是在這裏，有一個唯一的特徵在他們身上，就是：爲眞理而奮鬥的不屈不撓的精神。如果作爲一個眞眞的科學工作者，我想對着這種如此偉大的精神感召，無動於中的怕是很少的罷。</p>
<p>全書內容極通俗，敘述極勸人。雖然是五百頁左右的一本書，我竟毫不自覺地一口氣讀完了，當作中學生的科學敎本或者課外讀物的確是非常報宜的。</p>
<p>有志於科學者，向這裏去學習罷，爲了人類。</p>
<h3>談鳳子主編的　人世間</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>在整個出版界凋零飄搖的今天，一本文藝性的刋物，要不是自身內容確實有分量，想維持下去眞可謂難乎其難。</p>
<p>由於廣大讀者羣的支持，沒有雄厚資力作後台的人世間月刋，却能够屹立在這狂風暴雨般的經濟壓力下。因此可見縱然在續者購買力普遍下降的當口，一本良好讀物的需要，並不比大餅油條差多少。</p>
<p>爲了兩全讀者的口味和刋物本身的水準，我們見到編者許多苦心孤脂的地方：問於幾　份量相當重的文藝作品中，可以找到不少比較輕　潑刺的小品雜文，讓讀者略舒心頭的沉重悶氣；編排的靈活和豐富的插圖，冲淡了過於濃厚的文藝氣息，除了幾幅木刻和漫畫外，丁聰和梁琛二位先生的題花，增加了整個內容形式的生動。</p>
<p>從第一期到最近一期（第五期）爲止，形式上並沒有多大的差異，而在內容上却顯然稍有進出，例如小說和詩的比重，差不多逐期遠滅·（從百分之四十降至百分之二十），而散文雜感之類，却相反地增加。這也可以說是編者聰明的地方，在目前僅有的幾本文藝刋物里，內容方面，大都側　小說和詩歌，所以在本刮這種小型的有限　幅中，與其多着力於大塊的創作小說，還不如以短文隨筆取勝來得容易討好，因爲這究竟是一本「綜合」的文藝刋物呀。</p>
<p>遊記和人物誌之外，本刋更有一個特點—很有幾篇藝術方面的文章—這在目前一般文藝刋物中可以說是難能稀有的東西，例如李嘉的不朽的彫像，斯塔柯維區的苦悶，劉開渠的蘇聯彫刻，徐遲的音樂的做中學等，都是相當有價值有內容的。</p>
<p>也許也是爲了配合讀者口味的緣故吧，人世間依然脫不了明星制的選稿方式—但偶然也有一二個生疎的名字出現，尤其是最近二期，這弊病已經好多了。</p>
<p>是後，希望這本刋物能够出版下去，並且，更益壯實，更益豐滿！</p>
<h3>秦漢史</h3>
<p>— 公佩萱</p>
<p>（勞貞一著中國文化服務社出版）</p>
<p>這是一本列入靑年文庫的小書，所以它的文筆淺顯，敘述簡單。作者的意思似乎是以深入淺出的筆法，描繪出秦漢兩個朝代的興衰隆替來，這番用心我們是可以窺見到的。不過，以秦漢兩朝悠長的年代，和龐多繁雜的事蹟，要想拿區區的五萬來字把它詳述無遺，無論粗略之感。然而，它確是一件仁德　值得向讀者介紹的魯，當作中學生的課外補充讀物可，當作失學青年自修的課本亦可。</p>
<p>我們說這本書值得向讀者介紹，是基於以下兩個理由：（一）這本書以簡單的筆調　述秦漢兩朝的隆替，在敘事方面，給人以淸新的認識，比之於巨幅的大著，讀之叫人輕。（二）立論方面還相當正確，能度也相當穩重，這說明作者本人研究中國歷史的造　。因而，這本書不會引導讀者歪曲的認識了中國的歷史，這是寫史者的基本要點。</p>
<p>盡人皆知，一本書有一本書的寫法，各人著書有各人的觀點及主張，只看它的讀者對象如何，基於求精的要點上，這本書顯然是不合標準的。然而，它却有一個好的所在，那就是把全部穿插起來，它能吿訴你一個槪括的觀念，對於個別的狀况，讀者自可在這一整個的觀念中去尋紫了。本書開端敘述秦之興起，似乎草率得過甚；不過，這本書不是考據之作，在這方面倒是應該予以原諒的。然而，作者在開叙秦之興起時，至少應該把戰國末期秦之環境交代個清楚，似乎也不是讀者分外的苛求。</p>
<p>這本書寫作的重心，由它的目錄十章可以窺見全豹，即先敘秦的興亡，依次到楚漢之爭，按序述及漢之瓦解，最後殿以『兩漢學術信仰及物質生活』，秦的興亡一章是以敘言起筆的、在全書的份量上，秦漢應無輕重之分，但統觀全書，這一章秦的興亡倒像是寫漢史的序言了。楚漢之際一章，敘及鴻門宴時，作者把項伯項羽的關係　弄得大錯，原文說：『劉邦自知不敵，親往項羽營中解說，並由項羽的哥哥項伯的至交張良設法託項羽疏通』。又說：「當時范增勸項羽即席殺劉邦，但項羽聽了他哥哥項伯的勸　告猶豫起來，……』於是把項伯看成了和項羽一輩，原係叔侄之誼的關係，在此便弄成兄弟之行了。考項伯為項羽的季父，史記漢書均一致如此，史記高　本紀及項羽本紀兩見項伯爲羽季父之處，漢書高帝紀及項羽列傳亦數見項伯爲羽季父之文，漢書寫作在後，據由遷史，絕無疑問；可見項伯絕非項羽兄弟之行。這本書稱項伯爲羽的哥哥，不知來自何處？據我所知，王失之先生的讀通鑑論的論漢高帝一章裏，涉及項羽之處，倒是有稱項伯項羽爲兄弟的口氣的。原文是：『……（指項羽）惴惴慄慓，戈戟交於夢寐，抑惡能不厚疑天下哉？然而，其疑無救也。爲漢王心腹者：項伯也；其兄弟也。……』或者這就是稱羽伯爲兄弟的根據，看王夫之先生的文章語氣，這不過是譴責項羽「左顧右盼，唯是兄弟姻黨」罷了，絕不是把他兩列為兄弟行輩的。這一點、希望作者在再版的時候要加以訂正。</p>
<p>此外，劉邦成功的原因也是應該詳加分析的，本書裏也沒有盡到責任，也是這本書的遺憾之一。</p>
<h3>幸福的毀滅</h3>
<p>— 若非</p>
<p>讀A．紀德的「白莎佩」</p>
<p>安德烈，紀德的「白莎佩」，　　之　譯的「浪子回家集」中的一篇，我根喜歡這篇短文。它像詩，然而意境更深沉些；像戲曲，然而除了大衛王的獨白外，它就沒有構成戲曲的其他條件；像散文，然而形式上是詩，氣質上是詩，若干短句的詩意也遠甚於別人的詩篇。</p>
<p>用這樣奇特的形式和表現手法，紀　將一件人間慘事極形象化地刻劇出來了，這便是紀德的藝術造就，較之波特萊爾之流徒知以散文詩來表達單純的意境，其境界顯然高超得多了。我們可以這樣說吧：在紀德筆下的散文詩，顯然已跨入一個新的境界。</p>
<p>白莎佩，一個女人的名字，她最初象徽了奴隸怎樣從寂寥中攫得的幸福，其後，擁有更多的幸福的　主，不惜以卑鄙的手段予以　佔，白莎佩也就成爲奴隷與暴主間的犧牲品。</p>
<p>在這裏，紀德不僅描寫了猶大王大衛的變態心理，更要緊的是，他將猶大王當作暴主的典型人物來處理，寫得很形象化，很精緻。在短短的散文詩中，他敘述一個富有者無視於自己的富有，一味　　　人的財產和幸福，之後加以破壞，這心理過程的刻劃，實在抵得上一整部小說。</p>
<p>當大衛王竭力誇贊赫人烏利亞的饒勇與忠誡時，說：</p>
<p>「在亞　洞里，我苦求而不得淸淸凉；</p>
<p>土人屯營在谷中；</p>
<p>伯利恒已經被他們佔領了</p>
<p>你知道伯利恒有一　苦泉；</p>
<p>那天我渴慕州里的泉水</p>
<p>我想喝到它才甘心……</p>
<p>結果是誰闖過敵　的？</p>
<p>是誰奪不顧身爲我梢一杯茶來的！</p>
<p>到底是誰呢？你說。</p>
<p>是赫人烏利亞。」</p>
<p>雖然深知奴隸的忠誠的價值，但等到自已　中了赫人烏利亞的妻子白莎佩後、奴隷的饒勇與忠誠也無法挽回其自身的厄運了。正如大衛王所說：</p>
<p>「我手裏早就拿滿了幸福與財富，</p>
<p>以致不能再多拿一點，</p>
<p>可是那邊那個小幸福，</p>
<p>我甘願爲了它將另外的究全扔下……</p>
<p>它是從如此寂寥中得來的，這個幸福·」</p>
<p>一切慾念都是由這種心理變化而來的·以自我為中心的人，他永遠不會知足，當他厭倦於自己的大幸福時，他就覬　別人的小幸福。就白莎佩　　，　不過是一個小女人，然而在大衛王眼里，她在小　子里洗澡的風情便比任何美人更美了。「我簡直懷疑我所要的是她呢，或許是那個圈子呢，……還有那種酒，我所喝的那種酒，從他的小小的葡萄樹得來的酒！」這就是慾念的眞面目。大衛王眞的愛上了白莎佩嗎？並不，他只是閒得慌，要想爲自己的閒情找一條逃路而已。他愛的不是白莎佩本人，而是「連帶她那所國子的陰影」——那個小幸福。在他自己的大幸福外，他不許別人有絲毫幸福，儘管那人是如何饒勇與眞誠。</p>
<p>大衛王　於佔有了白莎佩，還說：</p>
<p>「因爲船在海面上的痕跡</p>
<p>男人在深湛的女體上的痕跡，</p>
<p>即使上帝也認不出。」</p>
<p>事實上還有更可悲的呢，赫人烏利亞正在前綫爲大衛王攻打拉巴城，後方，他的妻子已成爲大衛王的掌中　，爲了要永佔勇士之妻，大衛王就命令赫人說：「烏利亞勇冠三軍，該配列在最前綫；」一面則命令元帥約押，待赫人挨過城牆時，全軍突然引退，只拋下了赫人烏利亞一個。……</p>
<p>大衛王不費吹灰之力，輕易地自他的臣下手中　取了小小的幸福，因爲太不費力了，對於這小小的幸福就又覺得　不上眼了，當白莎佩身穿喪服，在黑夜裏來喜鵲大衛王時，後者說了些什麽呢？……</p>
<p>「走吧！帶她回去！我已經吿訴你我不願再看見她了……我討厭她！」</p>
<p>這就是結局。暴主的可憎，單是這幾句心理變態的描繪，已暴露得很深刻了。</p>

<h3>高中應該分科嗎</h3>
<p>應該分科的理由</p>
<p>（一）年前在蘇州的有原中學畢業，那個學校高中部過去曾一度分過科。照我同時身受過分科與不分科兩種制度的經歷，和入大學後的體騐，我對於高中分科有如下的意見：</p>
<p>我是主張分科的；但分科不宜　　　祇要分作文商科與理工科已足了，理由是這樣分法以後，投考大學時的分野明顯，而範圍較廣；走理工的和走文商的要斷然分開，而一科之中可以在將來的大學裏佔有許多系數。譬如理工科包括理科，工科，醫科，農科等；文商科包括文科，法科，商科等等。</p>
<p>分科以後各自可以向一方面作較深較遠的進展，在應用上說可收效宏，在個人興趣上說可得集中。我總以爲高中裏對於有些學科都應有了相當的綦礎，可是事實不盡然，那末，分科是達到這種目的的方法。若是中學畢業了便就業的話，祇要是選擇近於其所學的職業，能力一定也可强得多。</p>
<p>我是讀工科的，我就覺得像「大一」裏的「投影幾何」和「工程畫」之類很可以在高中分科後的理工科中先學習掉一部份。</p>
<p>有人說高中分科恐怕要使學生無法正確的選擇他所要選的學科，可是我們仔細想想，投考大學的人又何嘗「投」其所欲「投」的了呢？</p>
<p>— 本市黃慶麟</p>
<p>（二）現在的初等師範學校和職業學校都是變相的高中分科，所以我主張高中必須分科，因爲「夫人之才，成於專而毀於雜」。</p>
<p>— 本市王亁德</p>
<p>（三）高一可不分科，高二以上必須分科。</p>
<p>因現時高一課程，無論數學或生物均係共同應修習之學科，且可利用高一一年之時間，由學生本身及敎師就其志趣能力等作較週密之研究，而確定高二之應入何科。</p>
<p>現高二三普通科課程之缺點，在預備入大學理工科者，數理等課感覺不足，以致高三學生感覺投考大學之困難。</p>
<p>而預備入大學文，法，商，醫等科，則感覺現在高中二三年級所修習之數理課程太多，而對於自己所需之課程感到不足。故鄙意自高二起應分科。</p>
<p>— 南通管賢吾</p>
<p>（四）中國目前所需表爲切實，有效力，針對建國需要的敎育。若耗費如許年華於攻治虛浮不實際的理論，則大可不必。故爲前途計，亟宜　改此　學制，以突破求學不易之困難，而附合實際需要。</p>
<p>— 本市尤承</p>
<p>（五）在我們人才缺乏的國家中，能使每個靑年都具一技之長，使他們不要剛進社會，便受到失業的威脅，也可免去各處缺乏專門人才之苦。這不但是全國數千萬青年之幸，亦是國家社會之幸，但是多數青年都是無力進大學的，難道不給他們一些實際本領，看他們失業嗎？</p>
<p>— 本市譚德楨</p>
<p>（六）不妨將初級中學改爲四年制，入高級中學專科亦四年，則八年後的中學畢業生，不致造成不文不武的「人才」。</p>
<p>— 寗波戎錫存</p>
<p>（七）學生是希望分科的，學校當局的態度也差不多，不過，希望作得更具體一點而已。</p>
<p>高中分科，在某些地方，却早有成例，如湖南某些學校即是。其辦法爲二年級起文理任選一科。然而在敎育制度不變以前，譬如即使高中分了科，而進大學依然要考理科，這又有甚麽用？</p>
<p>我希望當局的敎育制度，能和事實配合。</p>
<p>— 南京張荻鷗</p>
<p>（八）今日的高中，道道地地的成了一個投考大學的機構，除了投考大學的最大目的外，似乎它本身沒有什麼其他的企圖。因爲入大學得考徴積分，代數，幾何，他就讀　積分，代數，幾何；因爲入大學須考社會，經濟，理化，他就讀社會，經濟，理化。他沒有顧意到這些是否切合學生的需求？是否對職業上有帮助？造成了今日學非所用的悲劇。</p>
<p>— 本市陳亮汀</p>
<p>（九）要是在高中分了科，醫如我想唸醫，就偏重一點文的方面，如中文國文，化學，生物學，可以减少許多數理方面的無端煩惱。</p>
<p>一個學醫的人的經騐，覺得高中需要分科。我想學工理或文法的人却必有同感。</p>
<p>— 本市魏贊道</p>
<p>（十）就目前中國社會之一般經濟情形而論，高中畢業後能繼續求學以期深造者，十人中能得幾人？所以我贊成現行中學敎育制應與分科制相輔而行。</p>
<p>— 大市劉一謹·高酬移賑水災</p>
<p>（十一）農科的分科最為需要，我國農民佔大多數，農家子弟在普通高中畢業後，再也不會從事農村服務改良。因爲所學非所用，以致今日農村敎育水準之不能提高，農柯之日趨下墮，故高中分科”在鄕村縣城之中學，極爲適宜。</p>
<p>— 南京陸志新</p>
<p>（十二）我絕對希望高中分科，並且採取選科制，這誠然是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>— 本市金冠</p>
<p>（十三）歸根結底一句，許多作弊，開快車，逃學的惡習，都可說是目前不合理的高中課程所釀成的後果。假如能够實行分科制度，讓他們各有所適，各安所學，成績自然美滿。</p>
<p>— 本市鄭宏基</p>
<p>（十四）至於分科的方式，我們主張仍舊採用過去「文」「理」二科的辦法，這在歐陸諸國像德，法都是的，至於美國或蘇聯式的多科制中學（包括各科職業或師範科的），則非正常高級中學所應然，我們不主張採用。</p>
<p>— 常州徐繼靖</p>
<p>反對分科的理由</p>
<p>A我是讀自然科學的，現在在工廠裏服務，對高中分科，我不敢贊同，我的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）高中分科容易造成「學非所宜」——一個人的興趣所在；不是短時期內能够確定的，很多學生在高中畢業預備進大學的時候，還猶豫不決，不知道應該選那一科？就是在大學肄業的學生，也往往發現所選讀的科目與自己的興趣不合。若是令一個初中畢業的學生去選讀一個專門科目，是不會有美滿成績的；隨便的選擇足以造成將來的後悔，是一件浪費光陰的事。</p>
<p>（二）高中分科，有「顧此失彼」之處——假使說高中分科是因爲大學四年，還不够專門，或者因爲讀商學文學的人說，幾何三角是學非所用，那麼我說，分科應該在小學裏就實行，或者就不必進學校，往工廠當工人，進商店當學徒，那才澈底眞是學其所用，頂專門了。但這是訓練匠人的方法，良好的科學家，實業家，不是這樣造就的。他們應具有各方面的智識，對自然科學，社會科學，商學，都有充份的豚識，所以專門訓練。應　普通智識的　　奠定後，才談　到，沒有良好　　的專門　是「匠人」。</p>
<p>— 本市銘</p>
<p>B中等學校已有尃科學校之設立，隨地可見，各學生興趣所趨，儘可申請插級或轉學。一般投考大學專科，其試題屬於普通科，對於高中分科學者，顯然不合，尚須分組應試，多數難以照辦？况大學專科，敎程由淺入深，高中分科學者，不無重複之感，且與普通科考入者同時條習，勢必有生熟利鈍，敎學方面頗多不利，如因學生資力關係，無法升入大學專科，而須早習專科知識技術，以求學成，才有所用，亦嫌不合潮流，試觀一般大報，逐日所載之公司行商機關法團聘用人員，限制甚嚴，專科人才乃限於大學或大學專科以上。故高中分科，學者之學歷資格，由一般社會視之，尚感造就之不足也。</p>
<p>— 南通邱潔</p>
<p>（編者按：反對分科者，尚有江都陳開甲，本市徐南榮，頑石，忠愷，趙　，寗振銳七先生，因意見大致相同，從略。）</p>
<h3>配合建國需要　加強專業訓練</h3>
<p>— 徐棟圻</p>
<p>—分科訓練已為必需</p>
<p>配合建國需要必須加强專業訓練，蓋半精不精的「通才」，已難能達到學以致用的目的。當今所急需的是：造就大量中級幹部人才，以從事國家的復興建設；並養成其有獨立生活之技能，所以分科訓練也就成爲必需了。</p>
<p>德之，分科的長處是在經濟與專長，以及减少有失業的危險。最後能促進建國大業的完成。唯其短處則在偏頗於各科各部門不易得到普遍的認識，此外便似無別的缺點可言了。然而僅此、也決不能認爲不應該分科的理由吧？</p>
<p>中學選習辦法早經試行，高中自第二學年起，均分甲乙兩組，有必修，亦有選修；各科敎學時數，因組別而異。現在我們提出來的「分科」，不過是選習辦法的進一步；更趨近於「職業化」，而是社會分工合作的預備吧了。（當熟）</p>
<h3>我提一個折衷辦法　高中添設課程准許選課</h3>
<p>— 但蒙</p>
<p>現行中學三三制的缺點，在於將各個性不同學生，循　一律的敎育制度而給予注入式的客觀敎育，未能順遂每人的專是和興趣的發展。雖然職業性敎育，如工業學校，商業學校等，但被傳統束解着，收效至徽。</p>
<p>如果中學便採取分科制，那弊病易使學生陷入不健全的基礎。免除這予看的　結，添設課程和准許選課，將是一值得考慮的方策。</p>
<p>將三三制改革爲六年制，大旣是必然的趨勢吧。這樣，可避去　床架屋的浪費。在六年制的統一計劃下，推行添課及選課的辦法，不僅可能，而且是必要。除了英文，國文，公民等是必修課外，數·理·化及史地的敎學方法，應一元化，不必再分初中及高中二次敎授。初級理化及初級史地·和算術·代數·平面幾何，可以强迫讀；高中部分的理化，史地與立體幾何，解析幾何等，便可列爲選修的課程了。何况這些課程的設立，用意原在便利投考大學的某一部，對並不志願選讀某一院系的同學，是全然無功的，那自該予以廢除。</p>
<p>添設些什麽課？大約的原則，是將基本的專門課程，一般在大學一年級必須重覆修讀的，併到中學的後期來，那麽它將有高級的物理化學，高級的史地，及其他數學等。此外可將多餘的時間再添設另外的選修課程，如法律總論，政治學，簿記學，新聞學，經濟學，商業概要，詩選文選，文藝寫作，力學，電學，　械要論，醫藥大網，農業槪說，以及更多數的功課，由學生自己去選讀。好在他們興趣所在，即可決定他們此後的事業意志。而發現有格格不入時，也易於轉換。再規定每一學生必須選若干種，那麽他們可活潑地找到了自己的出路。</p>
<p>雖則如此不能造成專門人才，而不過是撒下種子，但便以中學分科論，讀出來的人材也是　學均差的。那麽還不若採這一辦法，可以有彈性得多，讓每一　年有機會搜尋自己的興　所在。（蘇州）</p>
<h3>介紹一個高中分科的學校</h3>
<p>— 一丁</p>
<p>高中是否應該分科？已成了一個討論的焦點。究竟孰優孰劣，各具所見。筆者今介紹一所高中分科的學校，將其大略情形介紹如次，想可作敎育界之參考：</p>
<p>江蘇省立上海中學創始於民十六年，始分師範，普通，及商科。後更為分理，工，商三科以迄於今。</p>
<p>理科大概與普通科相仿，但數，理較重要，史地則列爲不主要科。敎學着重於實騐。物理，化學。生物皆沒有實騐室，由學生分組實騐。現因時間及敎學進度關係，理一實騐生物，理二實騐化學，理三實騐物理，分二人或三人一組實騐。理科着重在升學，同時因數理程度較高，故考取國立大學理工學院者，輒佔絕對多數。</p>
<p>工商科可列爲職業科，但亦有繼續深造者。茲再將工商二科作一簡單之介紹：</p>
<p>商科一年級有簿記，打字等科及有關商業常議方面。二年級再進一步商業地理，商業旣論，合作學，管理學，並有消費合作社以供實騐，商三三之實騐管理「上中銀行」，並研究統計畢、會計學，國畫貿易等。商三學生除在上中銀行實習外，並可至外埠商號或銀行實習。</p>
<p>工學學程比較繁重。一二年級即將代數，幾何，解幾三角：理，化學學習完畢，並加讀然工學，電工學，土木，繪　等科。在上中工廠實習。三年級加　機械原理，汽車學，飛機學等科，實習工作亦　重。故工科同學每日上課多至八小時，　外且須作題，實習，大有不克分身之感。此點亦即工科之缺點。簽者以爲，實有　放修業年限之必要。</p>
<p>以上爲「中上」理，工，商三科簡單之介認。諸位學者如欲作更詳盡之拼究，可與下列二先生治談：校長，沈亦珍博士，敎務主任盧克宜先生。</p>
<p>該校校址在滬閔路奧家巷。</p>

<h3>Timely Arrival of Reinforcements Completely Relieves Weifang Siege Yesterday; Besieged Bandits Collapse Under Internal and External Assault</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan by this newspaper, 30th] The siege of Weifang has been lifted. On the 30th, National Army reinforcements advancing north from the Nanma and Yue Zhuang areas occupied a line extending eight kilometers east of the city to Muhu Mountain and Nunnery Mountain, and ten kilometers west of the city to Shangxia Wujing. These forces coordinated an internal and external assault with General Li Mi's troops, who had been tenaciously defending the city walls for seven days and nights, resulting in the complete collapse of the communist bandits.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Linyi by this newspaper, 30th] The intensity of the battle for Weifang City exceeded even the recent Battle of Shanmei in Southwestern Shandong. The National Army, with a minimal force, faced fifteen times more bandits, enduring for seven days and nights. By the evening of the 29th, the east, west, and north gates of the city had all been breached by the bandits. The 30th was the most critical period, with the National Army holding only a corner of high ground in the south and Qushan in the east. At one point, communication with the rear was lost, leading to fears that the city had fallen. However, thanks to the exceptional command of General Li Mi, the unwavering advance of the entire army, and the air force's supply efforts amidst adverse weather, a fierce battle was fought continuously for seven full days and nights from the 24th to the 30th. By noon today, the main force of reinforcements from the south finally arrived at Muhu Mountain and Nunnery Mountain, eight kilometers east of the city, and the area around Shangwujing, ten kilometers west of the city. After coordinating with the defending troops within the city, they are now launching a fierce attack against the remnants of Chen Yi's seven columns, who are abandoning their positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 30th] The main force of the Shandong Communist bandits besieging Weifang began a complete collapse at 4 PM on the 30th. Remnants fled in two directions towards Gaoya and Yidu. The battlefield has become a sea of blood, with over 20,000 bandit corpses left behind. A large number were captured or surrendered. The weapons seized by the National Army can equip a brigade. The defending troops inside the city have now joined hands with the northern reinforcements and are currently pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandits after defeating the main force of the Shandong Communist bandits.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou by this newspaper, 30th] Commander Wang Yaowu completed his inspection in Taian and returned to Jinan on the 31st.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou by this newspaper, 30th] Chen Yi's First and Fourth Columns, surrounded by the National Army in the Baodugang and Shanting areas north of Zaozhuang, began breaking through the encirclement on the 28th, attempting to flee towards the Teng County - Zou County border's Jiehe Train Station. The National Army is currently intercepting them. Furthermore, Chen Yi's Eighth and Tenth Columns, based in the Dongping and Xiliangshan areas, have also begun fleeing towards the Zhangwu area southeast of Wenshang since the 28th. The National Army is sending reinforcements to pursue and剿.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin by this newspaper, 30th] National Army forces on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway advanced westward from Duliu, Jinghai, and Tangguantun on the morning of the 30th, crossing the Longgang River and launching mopping-up operations against bandit strongholds in Ding'an Wangkou Town and Ziya Town along the Ziya River. The bandit forces in the area, consisting of the 63rd, 64th, and 65th Regiments of Liu Bingyan's troops from the Central Hebei Military Region, and a prisoner conscript brigade, totaling three to four thousand men, engaged in fierce fighting until noon. Both Wangkou Town and Ziya Town were recaptured by the National Army, and the bandit forces retreated towards Wen'an, eliminating the threat to the western side of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The National Army forces that advanced near Ji, continued to consolidate their position on the 30th and did not advance further. Automobile traffic between Jinghai and Tangguantun was restored on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this newspaper, 30th] Zheng Dongguo says: The main force of the communist bandits is massing on the Pingmei Road, attempting to launch a sixth offensive, possibly in late August or early September. However, this is during the rainy season, and their movements and supplies will be hampered, making it difficult to succeed. The communist bandits have unlimited access to manpower replenishment. Although the damage in Siping was great, replenishment troops have already been sent from Jiangbei since the fighting has just ended. The National Army is currently closely monitoring their developments.</p>
<h3>Chairman Summons and Addresses Leaders Attending Grain Conference; Issues Important Instructions; Land Tax Conference to be Held Starting August 2nd</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] The National Grain Conference is scheduled to hold its third general meeting at 10:00 AM on the 31st to discuss the implementation measures submitted by President Zhang and six proposals from Shaanxi Province. A closing ceremony will be held immediately afterward, presided over by President Zhang. Provincial discussions continued on the morning of the 30th, convened by Yu Feipeng, who presided over discussions with representatives from Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Ningxia, Rehe, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. At 12:00 PM, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet at the Lixinshe for the provincial chairmen attending the meeting, delivering a nearly one-hour speech on the current domestic and international situation, as well as the revitalization of local politics. Grain Minister Yu Feipeng expressed satisfaction to reporters on the 30th regarding the progress of the conference, believing that the provincial chairmen were mostly able to follow the government's intentions. However, provincial speakers, from the perspective of public opinion, requested changes to a few areas. It is expected that this year's collection of actual grain and loans will not exceed 80 million dan. The quota for each province will be set after a decision by the General Assembly, but this will depend on the harvest in each province. In the evening of the 31st at 7:00 PM, the three leading figures of the Party, government, and military, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Chen Cheng, hosted a banquet for all the representatives attending the conference.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] After the conclusion of the Grain Conference, the Executive Yuan will convene a National Land Tax Conference on the 2nd, gathering the directors of the land and grain departments of various provinces for a two-day meeting.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] President Zhang convened the provincial chairmen attending the Grain Conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th for the second administrative meeting. Relevant department heads also attended. The discussion centered on the division of powers between the central and local governments, aiming to enhance administrative efficiency and reduce superfluous structures. However, no conclusion was reached at today's meeting, and a third meeting may be convened to continue the discussions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan held another administrative symposium at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, chaired by President Zhang. The provincial chairmen attending were Shen Honglie, Wang Dongyuan, Yao Shaozhou, Wang Maogong, Li Pinxian, Luo Zhuoying, Huang Xuchu, Wan Yaohuang, Guo Jijiao, Wang Lingyi, Liu Jianxu, Lu Han, and Wei Daoming. Also present were Xu Kan, Director of the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics; Wang Yunwu, Vice President of the Executive Yuan; and Ministers Bai Chongxi, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Zhu Jiahua, Yu Dawei, Zuo Shunsheng, Gu Zhenggang, and Xue Dubi; as well as Secretary-General Gan Naiguang and Deputy Secretary-General Pu Xuefeng. President Zhang first reported and asked the provincial chairmen to continue to express their opinions, stating that although these two meetings may not immediately resolve many major issues, he requested the provincial chairmen to broadly present their opinions, which would be summarized, studied, and gradually improved. Subsequently, the provincial chairmen delegated Shen Honglie to speak on their behalf. Shen stated that the provincial chairmen had met again on the 29th to exchange opinions and had provided additional supplementary opinions to the issues raised in the previous symposium. In addition, the "Government Reform Plan" and the "Improvement of Local Finance Plan" proposed by the Executive Yuan at the previous symposium had been discussed and studied, and all opinions would be reported verbally again. "The main focus is on the provincial agency personnel system." After the report, President Zhang asked the relevant ministers to report on the issues raised by the provincial chairmen, starting with Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense. President Zhang then added instructions and decided to schedule a third symposium to continue exchanging opinions.</p>
<h3>News Bureau of the Executive Yuan: Press Conference</h3>
<p>Director Dong Answers Questions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Director Dong Xian Guang of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan answered reporters' questions at a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 30th, as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Will the government try to arrange a meeting between General Wedemeyer and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party?</p>
<p>Question: If the CCP takes the initiative to want to talk to General Wei, will the government support it?</p>
<p>Answer: These are purely hypothetical questions, and I cannot answer them.</p>
<p>Question: Will the Chinese government concisely inform General Wedemeyer of its basic political, economic, and military needs? What does the Chinese government need?</p>
<p>Answer: I am sorry, I cannot tell you this at this time.</p>
<p>Question: Based on what General Wedemeyer has stated, what is the current attitude of the United States towards China?</p>
<p>Answer: General Wedemeyer's appointment to come to China to investigate the facts is sufficient to show the US government's concern for the situation in China.</p>
<p>Question: Will General Wedemeyer's investigation of new "facts" reveal "facts" that General Marshall has not discovered, or that the US Embassy has not known about?</p>
<p>Answer: Only General Wedemeyer will be able to answer this question when his mission is complete.</p>
<p>Question: What kind of recommendations does the Chinese government hope General Wei will make to the US government?</p>
<p>Answer: I am very sorry that I cannot tell you.</p>
<p>Question: What kind of recommendations do you think General Wei will make?</p>
<p>Answer: In my opinion, no one can answer this question except General Wedemeyer himself.</p>
<p>Question: Mayor Wu of Shanghai has called for a resolution to the Shanghai military police conflict. What kind of response will the Ministry of National Defense take?</p>
<p>Answer: Although this is a local incident, because the situation is relatively serious, the Headquarters of the Military Police and the Police Department have sent senior personnel to handle it in order to resolve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: What is the recent military situation?</p>
<p>Answer: Shandong was still the center of fierce fighting last week. In central Shandong, as of yesterday, the most intense battle of the week was at Weifang. The communist bandits mobilized the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Columns, another rapid column, and the main force of the Fifth Column, concentrating more than five columns of troops in total, to launch a fierce attack on Weifang. The battle is still ongoing, but the defending troops have passed through the critical period. In southern Shandong, the bandit army's First and Fourth Columns and a part of the Fifth Column have withdrawn west across the Jinpu Railway in Teng County. The connection between this group of communist bandits and other bandit armies in Shandong has been completely cut off. In western Shandong, the situation in Yangshanzhai is unknown, but the National Army to the west of that area has recovered Lingquan Town and Dongkou. As for northern Henan, the National Army has recovered Xiuwu, but the Jiaozuo coal area is still under heavy attack by the communist bandits.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongda to Leave for Zhangjiakou Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping by this newspaper, 30th] Ma Hongda is scheduled to leave for Zhangjiakou tomorrow to meet with Fu Zuoyi to discuss defense matters in Suiyuan and Ningxia. This morning, Mr. Ma went to Dabalizhuang, Xizhimen, to sweep the tomb of his father, Ma Fuxiang. It is reported that Mr. Ma will make a decision on the suppression of bandits in the Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Suiyuan border areas after returning to Ningxia. There is speculation that Ma Hongbin and Ma Bufang will be recommended by Ma as commanders of bandit suppression in the Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia border regions, which is under consideration by the central government.</p>
<h3>Commendation of Zhang Zhiyuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Government issued an order on the 30th, stating that the Executive Yuan reported that the Ministry of Interior had submitted that the late Deputy Division Commander Zhang Zhiyuan died in battle while suppressing bandits, which complies with the provisions of the Regulations on Commending Martyrs of the War of Resistance, and requested review and approval for a formal commendation. Deputy Division Commander Zhang Zhiyuan served in the military for a long time and achieved many merits. He fought bravely and died in Shanxi Province while suppressing bandits last year. Deep condolences are expressed. An order should be issued to formally commend him to honor his loyalty and martyrdom. This order.</p>
<h3>National Government Specifically Awards Medals to the Descendants of Meritorious Officers of the New First Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The National Government awarded medals to meritorious officers and soldiers of the New First Army in recognition of their defeat of the invading communist bandits in the Jichang Campaign in February and ensuring the safety of Jichang. Deputy Army Commander Jia Youhui and Chief of Staff Shi Shuo were each awarded the Third-Class Precious Tripod Medal. Division Commanders Zeng Shouzhi and Li Hong were each awarded the Fourth-Class Precious Tripod Medal. Deputy Division Commanders Chen Mingren and Yang Wen were each awarded the Sixth-Class Precious Tripod Medal. Officers and soldiers below the rank of Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Yongling were each awarded the Yunhui Medal and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal. Chief of Staff Chen, of the Ministry of National Defense, has telegraphed Army Commander Pan Yukun to inform all meritorious officers.</p>
<h3>Fuzhong and Yangtze Companies Issue Statements Explaining Business Operations; Refute Allegations of Violating Import and Export Regulations</h3>
<p>[Local News] Recent reports in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai regarding Fuzhong and other companies violating import and export regulations have garnered significant attention from various sectors after being reprinted by Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Fuzhong Industrial Company, issued a statement explaining the company's situation as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Has Fuzhong Company settled foreign exchange of up to 150 million US dollars with the Central Bank?</p>
<p>Answer: Fuzhong has only settled approximately 1.5 million US dollars in the past year and a half, of which over 200,000 US dollars were offset by Fuzhong's own foreign exchange, which can be verified with records.</p>
<p>Question: What is the equity stake of Song Ziliang, General Manager of Fuzhong Company?</p>
<p>Answer: All of Fuzhong's capital is invested by the Bank of Communications, the China National Products Bank, and the Jincheng Bank. There is no private capital involved. Song Ziliang is participating as a representative of the China National Products Bank, and I am participating as a representative of the Bank of Communications. Neither Mr. Song nor I have invested any personal capital.</p>
<p>Question: Has Fuzhong Company violated import and export regulations by importing automobiles?</p>
<p>Answer: Fuzhong's import of Jeeps and settlement of foreign exchange were in accordance with Customs Announcements No. 51, No. 55, and No. 80. Fuzhong's import of Jeep touring cars was within the quota allocated by the Import Management Committee. The Import Management Committee only allocated Fuzhong a quota of 101 vehicles for the entire year of 1946, which is less than the quota given to some other automobile dealers.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation with Fuzhong's import of wireless radios?</p>
<p>Answer: Fuzhong is the agent of Westinghouse Electric Company of the United States. In early 1946, the Central Air Transport Corporation, in view of the need to improve its telecommunications equipment in Shanghai and various domestic airports, signed a contract with Fuzhong to purchase a large batch of telecommunications equipment. However, due to frequent strikes at Westinghouse, the delivery was delayed. The wireless radios that Fuzhong is rumored to have imported are actually the Central Air Transport Corporation's equipment. When foreign manufacturers ship goods, the bill of lading only briefly states "Wireless radios, several boxes," so people mistakenly believe they are ordinary wireless radios. I have thoroughly investigated and confirmed that Fuzhong Company has never engaged in the business of ordinary wireless radio receivers since its inception and has never imported them.</p>
<p>Question: Does Mr. Qian have any opinions on the cause of the misunderstanding from the outside world?</p>
<p>Answer: Fuzhong was established at the end of the War of Resistance. The three banks aimed to cooperate with the government's post-war industrialization construction. Before the war, all imports of equipment and exports of local products were handled by others. After the War of Resistance, the Chinese people should pay attention to managing this industry, which will definitely benefit the country's overall economy. After its organization, Fuzhong immediately took over as the agent in China for several well-known American manufacturers. Therefore, merchants with older qualifications before the war, or those who already enjoyed vested interests, felt the impact. For the sake of competition and vested interests, they fabricated rumors and instigated discord. In reality, Fuzhong's total turnover in 1946 was miserably small compared to that of the older importers. I believe that the Chinese people should pay attention to comparing the foreign exchange earned by major companies last year with the foreign exchange earned by Fuzhong. It is fair to see who earned more and who earned less.</p>
<p>In addition, the person in charge of Yangtze Company stated: "Yangtze Company was established in January 1946. As of the end of April this year, it had settled only over 1.8 million US dollars in foreign exchange in sixteen months, while the report stated over 180 million US dollars, a difference of a hundred times. Perhaps there was an error in the decimal point. Regarding the three wireless radios in the imported goods, legal procedures were obtained, and they were purchased for personal use. As for the return of 228 boxes of cosmetics, this did not happen. As of recently, the company has settled 1.28 million yuan in foreign exchange with the government for export business. After offsetting the foreign exchange for imports and exports, it has remitted a net amount of over 500,000 yuan in foreign exchange to the government. Allocated over 19 months, this amounts to only about 30,000 yuan per month. This amount is also not large," and so on.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, State] Supervisory Committee member Wang Guanwu recommended that the government should establish a special committee to thoroughly investigate the accounts of Fuzhong Company, Construction Bank Company, and Yangtze Trading Company. Wang Guanwu is one of the supervisory committee members sent by the government to Shanghai to investigate the activities of these three companies.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] At the press conference held by the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the 30th, when a reporter inquired about the incident of Fuzhong and Yangtze companies violating import and export regulations, Director Dong stated: "This matter is currently being investigated by the relevant agencies, and I have nothing more to say."</p>
<h3>Air Force Staff College Holds Graduation Ceremony This Morning</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Will Personally Attend and Give Instructions</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] According to the military news agency: The Air Force Staff College is scheduled to hold the graduation ceremony for the sixth class of students at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Chairman Chiang will personally preside over the ceremony and give instructions to the graduates. Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Zhou Zhirou, etc., will also attend the grand ceremony. Presidents of universities in the capital have also been invited to attend. All faculty and students will have a group dinner, and an evening party will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Sympathize With Chairman's Remarks to American Journalists; Claim Our Current Situation is Due to Complex Reasons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The first response from the press here to Chairman Chiang's remarks to American journalists on the 27th appeared in the Scripps-Howard-owned "World Telegram." The newspaper published an editorial titled "Fair Treatment of China." The full text is as follows: "Chairman Chiang's request that the American press give more sympathetic consideration to the Chinese problem is worthy of deep thought. The various inequalities in China's social system, when revealed all at once and measured by Western standards, can easily lead to a distorted view of the complex situation in this vast country. When Japan launched its war in 1937, the so-called Republic of China was little more than an empty term. At that time, warlords controlled various regions, and the Communist Party controlled the rest. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted aggression alone. From 1941 to 1945, China under the Kuomintang was the army under Chiang's control against the Japanese. After the end of the war in 1945, the United States immediately demanded that Chairman Chiang end his feud with the Communist Party, the method being to establish a Kuomintang-Communist coalition government to unify China. During these negotiations, there was no time to address other political problems. At the same time, when the Soviet Union withdrew from the Northeast, it turned the Northeast into a region controlled by the Communist Party, greatly damaging the Kuomintang's position. The political and economic situation in China today is more complex than it was at the end of the war, due to a combination of Soviet conspiracy, American indecision, and Chinese mismanagement. Until recently, Chairman Chiang was able to decide on actions freely within the country. Chairman Chiang must have suppressed a forced smile when he stated to American journalists that the United States also had a stake in its suppression of the Communist Party. Although the United States' understanding of this view has been belated, it has now gained widespread recognition. However, not long ago, the State Department insisted that Chairman Chiang invite the Communist Party to join the government."</p>
<h3>Snowflakes Flutter on Beita Mountain; Our Troops Capture One Mongolian Soldier Attempting to Assault Our Positions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qitai, Beita Mountain, 27th (Delayed)] Amid rumors, the reporter came to Beita Mountain yesterday with Brigade Commander Han of the 7th Cavalry Brigade, staying overnight in a Mongolian yurt. Heavy snow suddenly fell late at night, and the temperature dropped below zero degrees. This morning, snowflakes were still fluttering. Alagtag Mountain, the main peak of Beita Mountain, stood tall amidst the clouds and vastness, covered in silver. Last night, our troops captured one Mongolian soldier attempting to assault our positions. The rumor circulating in Qitai for days that the Mongolian side had increased its troops by over a thousand cavalry and planned to attack us was confirmed by the captured Mongolian soldier. This morning, the reporter and Brigade Commander Han rode to the top of Alagtag Mountain and looked down at the Mongolian army's positions in Ulastai, north of the mountain. After the snow, the horizon was clear for thousands of miles. In the distance, six or seven cars were parked behind the Mongolian army, seemingly having arrived last night. According to the reporter's observation, Beita Mountain is about 200 li long and 50 li wide, with steep mountains. With the loyalty and bravery of our troops, we will surely crush the shameless attack of the invaders.</p>
<h3>Wei Envoy to Fly to Peiping, Then Shenyang; Bishop Yu Bin Urges Attention to the Northeast; Ministry of Economic Affairs Compiles Data for Submission to Mission</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] The US Embassy announced that Wedemeyer and his advisors will leave Nanjing for Peiping on August 1st to begin their inspection tour of the north. On the morning of the 30th, Wei only spoke with his advisors to discuss the data and documents he continued to receive. In the afternoon, he met with several guests. He had both lunch and dinner with Ambassador Stuart.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this newspaper, 30th] On the afternoon of the 30th, Wedemeyer successively met with Li Zongren, Wei Daoming, Feng Yan, and Yu Bin. It is reported that Li and Wei's conversation focused on arranging their inspection tour of Peiping and Hebei. (Note: The date for Wei's trip to Taiwan has not yet been determined.) Feng Yan is the Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of National Defense. He told reporters afterward that he had served as a liaison officer at Mountbatten's headquarters and had a previous friendship with Wei, so he visited him and spoke for about a quarter of an hour. As for the content of the conversation with Wei, it mostly involved the Northeast problem. Bishop Yu Bin visited Wedemeyer at 4:30 PM on the 30th, accompanied by Pan Chaoying, and they spoke for over an hour. Yu told reporters afterward that Wei first inquired about the current situation of the Catholic Church in China and expressed concern about the damage suffered by religious undertakings in the communist-occupied areas. After Yu answered, he raised the Northeast problem, stating that the situation in the Northeast has been deteriorating since the victory, and its development will have a significant impact on future world peace. He urged Wei to pay attention to this area, which has implications for international disputes, and hoped that he could personally visit the area for on-site inspections to obtain sufficient data to meet his needs. Wei expressed that he was very concerned about the Northeast and had decided to go to Shenyang. Finally, Wei and Yu exchanged views broadly on the general situation in China. Yu said that the views exchanged would not be released for the time being.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] In order to provide economic data for Wedemeyer's visit to China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specially compiled "Data on the General Situation of Chinese Industry" and translated it into English for Wei's reference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] According to sources in the industry, U.P. reported late on the 30th that General Wedemeyer does not intend to seek contact with the Communist Party after he goes to North China on Friday, but he is willing to listen to any opinions presented by the Communist Party if they contact him. Because his announced tour is entirely within National Army territory, observers believe that although a meeting with the Communist Party is possible, it is unlikely to happen.</p>
<h3>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Far East Regional Committee Recommends Suspending Shipment of Supplies to North China; Yellow River Disaster Relief Efforts Will Also Be Halted</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] According to the Ta Mei Evening News: According to sources, due to the government's decision to blockade ports in the communist-controlled areas, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) Far East Regional Committee has recommended that UNRRA relief supplies no longer be shipped to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude. That is, areas north of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Xuzhou will no longer be within the scope of assistance. Yellow River area flood relief, which was one of UNRRA's main undertakings in China, will also be halted. The original plan to provide supplies to the government-controlled and communist-controlled areas of North China was for more than 50,000 tons. As a result of this suspension, the more than 250,000 tons of supplies currently being transported, most of which are industrial and construction materials, will also be affected. It is reported that the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee has decided to temporarily suspend the distribution of supplies originally intended for North China and the Northeast until the Chinese government lifts the blockade on the shipment of relief supplies to communist-controlled areas, or until the Washington headquarters decides to provide all supplies to government-controlled areas. The capital believes that UNRRA will adopt the latter decision within a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, the UNRRA China Office has not yet issued any official announcement on this matter.</p>
<h3>The Saying That Xiaoshan Nanshatou Peng Township Has Completely Submerged Is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>Tang Works Bureau Decides to Hasten the Construction of Tiaoshui Dam</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 30th] It is widely rumored here that Xiaoshan Nanshatou Pengjin Township has already completely submerged. Our reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Tang Works Bureau, who said that only a portion of Tou Peng has been swallowed by the sea tide. The bureau's engineering office is still in the town. However, observing the current situation, the submergence of the entire town is extremely dangerous. From August 1st, the Nansha emergency repair project will be completely taken over by the Tang Works Bureau. The bureau has decided to build stone-filled wooden cage embankments along the one-kilometer coastline near Tou Peng along the river to protect the shore and build Tiaoshui dams. This project requires about 1.6 billion yuan. In addition to the original 400 tons of flour for work relief, the bureau will allocate another 200 tons and allocate another 600 million yuan of public funds. The remaining half will still be raised by the local government. Currently, the flow of the Qiantang River is shifting southward, and the vicinity of Haining is already a shallow beach. This autumn, the Qiantang River tide will no longer be a spectacle here and will need to be viewed in Nansha.</p>
<h3>Cultivation and Damage Are Prohibited at Military Airfields in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Ministry of National Defense Orders Subordinates to Protect Them</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] According to the Military News Agency: The Ministry of National Defense considers military airfields in various locations to be of great importance to bandit suppression operations and national defense construction. However, recent reports indicate that a small number of agencies and troops have damaged airfields and engaged in unauthorized cultivation, which must be strictly prohibited. It is reported that the ministry has ordered its subordinates to cooperate in maintaining the airfields within their respective areas in the future to maximize their effectiveness.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party's National Congress Concludes Joint Review Meeting</h3>
<p>The Contents of the Party Constitution Are Largely Determined</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party's National Congress held joint review committee meetings yesterday morning and afternoon. The formal congress will begin today. The party's intentions have been largely determined, and the powers of the chairman and the Standing Committee are stipulated in detail. The organizational methods of local party headquarters at all levels are also listed in detail. During this National Congress of the party, Vice Chairman Wu Xianzi did not attend and published a statement stating that no overseas representatives participated. Wu stated that the main reason for the failure to resolve internal disputes lies in the order of priority between restoring the party membership of those who had been expelled and abolishing the Revolutionary Committee. Also, rumors that after the number of Kuomintang members in the National Government Committee was cancelled, the Democratic Socialist Party would request half of the eight seats were inquired about. Democratic Socialist Party members stated that this was absolutely inaccurate and had never been discussed.</p>

<h3>The Central Political Council Will Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Today to Discuss Sino-Japanese Trade Issues, to be Submitted to the State Council Meeting for Discussion Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The State Council Committee is scheduled to hold its eighth State Council meeting on the 1st to discuss two major cases: the economic reform plan and the opening of Sino-Japanese trade.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The Central Political Council held a routine meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. First, Bai Chongxi, Wang Shijie, and Yu Hongjun reported on the recent military, foreign affairs, and financial situation, respectively. Then, the opening of Sino-Japanese trade was discussed, and Zhang Qun reported on the deliberations of the Executive Yuan on the case. Many committee members expressed their opinions, and the advantages and disadvantages of opening and not opening were studied in detail. The discussion was extensive. It was believed that the case was extremely important and that another meeting was necessary. It was decided to convene an extraordinary meeting at 8:00 AM on the 31st to specifically discuss the case. At the meeting on the 30th, those who advocated opening also expressed dissatisfaction with the original plan and believed that it could be revised. As for those who believed that it was not necessary to open, their reasons were still based on the current economic situation. It is also learned that Guo Taiqi, our representative to the United Nations Security Council, has been overworked due to his busy meeting schedule and needs a short break. The government has approved his request for sick leave and appointed Jiang Tingfu to temporarily replace him. This was also decided at today's Central Political Council meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] Senator Wu Jingxu recently told reporters that he does not agree with the opening of Sino-Japanese trade. He stated that before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese emphasized economic cooperation and called for an agricultural China and an industrial Japan. At that time, our country did not accept this request because it did not want to be an appendage of Japan. Later, the War of Resistance broke out. Now that China has won and Japan is in a defeated state, and the peace treaty has not yet been signed, how can there be a victorious country opening trade to a defeated country? Moreover, we should know that the foundation of Japan's military industry has not been destroyed. What Japan needs are raw materials for heavy industries such as iron, salt, and cotton. If we open Sino-Japanese trade, these raw materials will flow into Japan, which is tantamount to assisting the reconstruction of Japan's heavy industry. The result will first endanger our country. We know from past experience that after Japanese goods are shipped to China, the political and military power of Japanese merchants will follow. Wu then raised two facts that deserve attention: one is Taiwan, which was under Japanese control for 50 years. Now that it has returned to the embrace of the motherland, it is still restless. The other is the Northeast, which was occupied by Japan for 14 years. Now the people in the Northeast live in poverty and cannot stabilize. If Japanese goods are opened and flow to the Northeast and Taiwan, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, we must not be greedy for temporary gains and create future troubles. When Wu talked about the issue of the Sino-Japanese peace treaty, he believed that we should prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and that the eradication of Japanese militaristic thought should be carried out through re-education. We should adopt a century of control over Japan based on the ancient teaching of "cultivating people for a hundred years" to achieve its effect. As for the control opinion, Wu believes there are several points: (1) The Allied countries should set up a control mechanism in Japan. (2) Japanese industrial production should be in accordance with the control methods of the Allied countries. (3) All military equipment in Japan, especially the armed police, should be thoroughly dismantled. (4) Disguised military schools cannot be established. Wu believes that these points are the minimum conditions for control.</p>
<h3>Our Business Delegation Cancels Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A leader of a certain industrial and commercial circle stated that the business delegation to Japan, which the government originally planned to send, has been delayed for too long, and the delegations from other countries, such as Britain, Australia, and India, have arrived in Japan for many days. Therefore, it is no longer planned to go. As far as the restoration of private trade with Japan is concerned, it should be a part of our entire foreign trade. Because our country has not prepared for this at all, the industrial sector is only filled with fear and has no constructive countermeasures. However, solving the problem of opening private trade with Japan cannot be done by passively opposing it. It is heard that in September this year, major commercial centers such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will elect representatives to discuss our country's entire foreign trade issues. Whether this matter is convened by the government or initiated by the people, it is a necessary move. If China wants to gain a leading position in Asia, the most ideal path is, of course, to use American capital and technology, but in the current situation, whether it is possible is still a question. Another path is to use Japanese technology under certain conditions, which is actually possible if used properly. As for those who advocate expanding the scope and quantity of the Central Trust Bureau's barter trade to replace the opening of private trade with Japan, of course, there is also a point of view, but today's democratic countries advocate free trade, and we should not go against this trend.</p>
<h3>Unified Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Urges the Bureau of Standards to Prepare for the National Metrology Conference</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The promotion of the unification of weights and measures had achieved considerable success before the war, but unfortunately, due to the suspension of metrology in the occupied areas during the War of Resistance and the destruction of the system, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to review the direction of promoting metrology work in the future, has urged the Bureau of Standards of the ministry to convene a national metrology conference of responsible persons from metrology from all provinces and cities in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Coal Production Increase Conference Begins Registration Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The Coal Production Increase Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on August 1st.

<h3>Taiwan Scientists Organize New High Mountain Survey Team</h3>
<p>Departure from Taipei to Shanzhen today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei, 30th] Following the scientific survey team to Red Head Island (Lanyu), Shih Yen-han, Director of the Meteorological Bureau here, Wang Renyu, a technician, and others have formed another scientific survey team. The destination is New High Mountain, which is completely different from Red Head Island. The mountain was originally named Jade Mountain, with an altitude of 3,950 meters. It is the only peak on the coast of the Western Pacific. After the Japanese seized Taiwan, because the mountain was higher than Mount Fuji, it was renamed New High Mountain by imperial decree on June 28th, Meiji 30th year. Due to the changing peaks and its high location, it is the most conditional observation point for meteorological observation and geophysical research. Moreover, because the mountain is the mountain with the lowest subtropical temperature, the flora and fauna and geological aspects have special research value in academia. The main members of the team are meteorologists Shi and Wang, geologist Bi Qingchang, and agricultural, animal, and plant researchers, etc., seven or eight people. They decided to take the night train from Taipei to Chiayi on the evening of the 31st, and the next morning, they will take a gasoline car from Alishan to New High Mountain. It is planned to conduct two days of research and observation on the mountain and then descend the mountain. Transfer to Taichung to return to the province. Our newspaper reporter was also invited to participate, and I am deeply gratified, because after the restoration, it is the first time for a planned research on New High Mountain, and there is no precedent for reporters to climb this mountain. The most important thing to note before departure is to prepare a woolen sweater, because the climate on the mountain is colder. Although you are sweating in Taipei, the autumn wind is still rustling on New High Mountain.</p>
<h3>Foshan Ship Smuggling Case, Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Decides to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Orders the Ship to Hand Over the Principal Culprit Immediately</p>

In order to thoroughly punish smugglers and eliminate smuggling, the Pacification Headquarters has ordered the ship to hand over the principal culprit smugglers immediately and ordered the Foshan ship to suspend sailing until the smugglers are handed over.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Peace Conference with Japan, US Decides to Postpone Convening, Our Country's Reply Has Long Been Delivered to the US Embassy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 30th] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, announced at a press conference on the 30th that with regard to the US proposal on July 11 to convene a meeting of eleven countries to discuss the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan, our reply was delivered to the US Ambassador to China on July 17, who immediately informed the US State Department by telegram. Our government also instructed the Ambassador to the United States on the same day to discuss this matter with the US State Department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 29th] State Department officials recently said that the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan, which the United States proposed to convene on August 19, has been decided to be postponed. Although the date has not yet been decided, it is being discussed and a decision can be made within days. The United States will submit a note to the Soviet Union regarding this conference. The method of the note can also be decided within days. The Soviet Union's reply advocated that the meeting of foreign ministers should discuss it. The US note will probably refute it, but it is considered that it can be issued in the form of the four powers discussing the matter in advance. However, the United States will not change its position, that is, the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission must participate in the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Speaks</h3>
<p>Opposes the Four Powers Drafting the Peace Treaty</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 30th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt recently said here that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted in early 1948. He also said that Australia would oppose any suggestion that the treaty be limited to the four countries. Evatt did not mention the Soviet Union's suggestion that the Japanese peace conference be limited to the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. However, he emphasized that, from Australia's standpoint, all eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission must attend the Japanese peace treaty conference.</p>
<p>Evatt said at a banquet for reporters that if the preliminary peace conference with Japan is held by eleven countries, there should be no major difficulties in drafting the treaty. He believes that the meeting may be held in mid-February or March next year.</p>
<p>Evatt said that a peaceful settlement with Japan is not a long-term thorny issue and should be completed in early 1948. In fact, its basic principles have been agreed upon by the Far Eastern Advisory Commission and have since been recognized by the current Far Eastern Commission. The foundation of the treaty has also been laid by MacArthur's administration in Japan, as disarmament has now been practically completed.</p>
<p>When asked if he agreed that the conference should be held in Japanese cities such as Kyoto, he replied that he hoped that the conference could be held in a location in the Pacific region such as San Francisco or Honolulu. When asked whether the peace treaty would be easier to conclude without the participation of the Soviet Union, he replied that this was a delicate question, but according to common sense, the Soviet Union should participate, and the meeting should adopt a two-thirds majority vote.</p>
<p>He estimated that the Allied countries' monitoring of Japan would require ten years or more. He believed that the most effective way to control Japan's war potential was to monitor its import and export trade.</p>
<p>Finally, Evatt emphasized that the Japanese peace treaty must be based on the security and prosperity of the Pacific, so the Japanese economy must be made part of the overall economy of Asian and Pacific countries.</p>

<h3>Singapore Overseas Chinese Donate Money to Relieve the Guangdong Disaster, British Side Refuses to Allow Remittance, Acting Governor Has Agreed to Negotiate with London Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Singapore, 29th] The Singapore Foreign Exchange Bureau notified Li Guangqian, Chairman of the South China Flood Relief Association, today that the British government in London could not agree to the association's request to remit funds to relieve the South China refugees. The reason is that the total amount of relief funds remitted to China within the entire British Empire has already reached its limit, so it cannot approve any other remittances. This news was announced at the South China Flood Relief Meeting this afternoon. The people of the association were deeply angered by the British government's refusal. The association asked Li to negotiate with the Singapore government again.

<h3>A Student at Tsinghua University Stabs a Professor with a Knife Due to Failing the Exam, Arrested, Teachers and Students Confronted in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping, 30th] A student stabbing a professor occurred here on the 26th. Jin Chengyi, a second-year student in the Department of Economics at Tsinghua University, was dissatisfied with Professor Zhao Renjun's assessment of his monetary silver science exam paper, which did not meet the professor's prescribed procedure, and was given a failing grade. On the evening of the 26th, he went to Professor Zhao's residence to argue, but was unsuccessful. In anger, he took out his small knife and stabbed Professor Zhao. Jin was arrested and sent to the authorities that night, and sent to the court on the 28th. At 2:00 PM, teachers and students confronted each other in court. Jin has been released on bail pending trial. According to Jin, he inverted the exam questions unintentionally. Professor Zhao previously suspected him of plagiarism, and he wrote to Zhao to explain his reasons. He also said that this failure would affect his public expenses for the next semester, and he hoped to re-grade the paper. The letter also said that if he was not believed, he would choose the last of the three paths in life. When arguing on the 26th, he originally wanted to invite the professor to drink and resolve the matter peacefully, but he was rejected before entering the door. In anger, he threw a wine bottle at the professor but missed. Instead, Zhao struck him with a wooden stick, so he took out a fruit peeling knife to resist and stabbed Zhao. Professor Zhao said that Jin came aggressively. At first, he closed the door and ignored him, but his son opened the door. Jin then threw the wine bottle and shouted, "I will kill him first, and then I will kill you." The wine bottle missed, and Jin took out a seven-inch dagger from his waist and stabbed him wildly but missed. Then his son injured him with a wooden stick, and two assistant teachers who happened to be in front of the door captured Jin and sent him to the police station. Both sides have their own stories, and the truth remains to be seen pending a court hearing.</p>
<h3>Traitorous Bandits Rampant in Eastern Zhejiang, Hindering Conscription Work</h3>

<h3>Editorial: Calm Thinking, Detailed Investigation!</h3>
<p>Because the Capital Central Daily News disclosed the outline of the financial and economic departments' investigation report on the foreign exchange settlement situation of Fuchung, Yangtse, and other companies, a decimal point was missed in the numbers, and the Associated Press telex miscalculated the numbers, so society was again clamoring for "tycoon capital." If there really is tycoon capital, everyone is willing to give it a head-on blow, but after calm reflection, if we rush to release arrows based on this entangled record, I am afraid it may not "hit the mark." Please everyone think calmly first, and further request the government or the Central Bank to investigate and announce the complete list and amount of those who have applied for foreign exchange settlements for import or other reasons since the victory, to verify where the "tycoon capital" really is.</p>
<p>According to the investigation report of the two ministries carried in the Central Daily News, from March 4th to November 17th of the 35th year of the Republic, the Central Bank sold a total of US$381,552,461.13 in foreign exchange, and another US$2,012,040.80 was sold by February 1st of the 36th year of the Republic, totaling US$383,564,501.93. If Fuchung's foreign exchange settlement was indeed more than 153 million US dollars, and Yangtse's foreign exchange settlement was more than 180 million US dollars, then the official foreign exchange obtained by the two companies reached a huge sum of more than 330 million US dollars, accounting for nearly 87% of the total foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank. This would be a monopoly that would be difficult to defend. However, the fact is not so. According to the conversation with the chairman of Fuchung Company yesterday, the company only settled more than 1.5 million US dollars, and Yangtse Company's announcement also said that it only settled more than 1.8 million US dollars, totaling more than 3.3 million US dollars, which is exactly one hundred times different from the amount reported by the Associated Press. Moreover, reading the original text carried in the Nanjing Central Daily News, it can be known that the Central Daily News missed the decimal point before the last two digits, which constitutes this "magnified one hundred times" spectacle. We discuss the matter based on the facts, and discuss the two companies' foreign exchange settlement amount based on the investigation report, and it seems that the power of "tycoon capital" is not as large as rumored, because they only obtained 0.87% of the total foreign exchange, less than 1%. May I ask, which of the larger companies or import and export firms in Shanghai today, their capital, the foreign exchange they hold, is only this small amount? Then, who is the owner of the tycoon capital? It is really a question worth noting.</p>
<p>Now that the financial and economic departments have investigated Fuchung, Yangtse, and other companies and issued reports, we very much hope that the authorities will continue to thoroughly investigate the complete list and amount of all foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank in the past year and a half or since the Anti-Japanese War, so that the people of the country can know which "tycoons" - including wealthy merchants and tycoons - have enjoyed the country's favor and accumulated superior capital. At least during this year and a half, the Central Bank sold the foreign exchange for 99% of the imported goods, which trading companies were they sold to? - Chinese trading companies or foreign trading companies? This is the procedure that should be taken for "seeking the truth."</p>
<p>Finally, we advocate that everything - including international trade - should be equal for everyone, and oppose the existence of special classes, regardless of whether this special class is Chinese or foreign. We especially want to encourage Chinese and foreign merchants to do all business on an equal footing, but we cannot just follow the foreign merchants and dislike Chinese companies or trading companies operating import and export, and strike at them at every turn. In short, we hope to make all facts public, and we must make calm and objective judgments based on the true facts.</p>
<h3>A Review of the United States' China Policy</h3>
<p>Since President Truman appointed General Wedemeyer as a special envoy to China to investigate the truth about the Chinese situation, the general public believes that this is probably a precursor to the United States' impending change of its China policy. Even the Washington Post in Washington, D.C., according to the news transmitted by the Associated Press, also wrote an article yesterday, believing that General Wedemeyer's arrival in the East may be a sign of a change in the United States' China policy. The newspaper also said that this change in China policy was initiated by the lifting of the ban on arms exports to China on June 28. Whether the United States' China policy is about to change is entirely in the hands of the United States government and people, and we do not want to make any judgments; but from a historical perspective, we believe that the United States' China policy has a consistent tradition, from the announcement of the Open Door Policy, through the convening of the Washington Conference and the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, to the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine and the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States' China policy has been fundamentally consistent: that is, to maintain the emergence of a unified and strong China. What was the reason for the announcement of the Open Door Policy in the era of John Hay? It was to maintain the unity of China. By the end of the First World War, Japan dominated East Asia, and the United States convened the Washington Conference. What was the reason? It was to maintain the unity of China. When Japan tore up the treaty and established the puppet "Manchukuo," Secretary of State Stimson announced the Stimson Doctrine. What was the reason? It was to maintain the unity of China. Because the United States' consistent policy is to maintain a unified and strong China, this conflicts with Japan's policy of invading China, which eventually led to the Pacific War. This policy of the United States is in line with the national aspirations of China, so we see the Chinese and American youth fighting side by side. Therefore, this China policy of the United States has been baptized in blood. We do not believe, and we do not want to see, that this China policy will change in the world today, when the major war has just ended and the international situation is becoming increasingly unstable.</p>
<p>However, policy is one thing, and strategy is another. The policy remains unchanged, but the strategy changes with the different times and circumstances. Looking at the United States since its founding, its foreign policy has three aspects: for the Americas, we see the Monroe Doctrine; for Europe, not to conclude any alliances with collusive significance; for the Far East, the Open Door Policy. These three policies constitute the entirety of the United States' foreign policy. These three policies cannot be shaken and cannot be changed; but in order to implement these three policies, the strategy must be changed as necessary according to the times. The Monroe Doctrine for the Americas is no longer entirely the same as the meaning of President Monroe due to the evolution of the situation in the past hundred years. The initiation and active participation of the United Nations organization does not conflict with the policy of not concluding any alliances with collusive significance; we cannot say that because the United States participated in this organization, it has changed the traditional policy of not concluding alliances with any country. The situation in the Far East is also the same.</p>
<p>The United States was originally a country in the Western Hemisphere, but since the Spanish-American War, the United States has become a Far Eastern country. After the First World War, the United States became a world power in one fell swoop. Even the maritime hegemony that the British Empire was unwilling to give up was divided equally with the United States in a 5:5:3 ratio. By the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only country whose homeland had not been invaded and destroyed by enemy forces; now, it is in fact the hope of the world in the future, and it is leading the world. However, since the end of the Second World War, the United States has not had a clear expression of how to lead the world until recently; therefore, situations that run counter to the ideals of this war have developed everywhere in the world. Due to the development of the United States in the past fifty years, the United States has been very concerned about the Far East. It has a traditional China policy. If it can implement it seriously, the situation in the Far East, especially the situation in China, would not be in the current situation. What has caused this situation is not that the United States has no policy towards China, but that this policy has not been emphasized and implemented.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we talk about the United States' China policy today, what we expect is not a change in policy, but how to strengthen the implementation of this policy. The traditional policy of the United States towards China is to maintain and support a unified and strong China; there are various ways to implement this policy. After the First World War, we saw President Harding convene the Washington Conference, inviting nine countries to attend, and reaffirmed the Open Door Policy, which is to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty and equality of opportunity. This was indeed a wise move at the time, especially when Japan and China had the so-called Twenty-One Demands secretly signed. After the September 18th Incident, Japan established the puppet state of "Manchukuo" in the Northeast. Under the circumstances at the time, the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine was also a wise move. However, the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine ultimately failed to solve the Far East problem. Instead, Japan intensified its aggression against China, which eventually led to the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 7 and the Pacific War that followed.</p>
<p>The United States has its traditional policy towards China, and the situation that emerged in China after the war is inextricably linked to Yalta. The United States has a moral responsibility to strengthen the implementation of its traditional policy towards China - maintaining and supporting a unified and strong China. How should this policy be expressed in today's Chinese situation? By strengthening the aid to the legitimate government supported by the Chinese people and recognized by the great powers, and supporting this government with all its strength. More specifically: it is to implement the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan in China and the Far East. The communist bandits have isolated themselves from the Chinese people, and the Chinese people and government are mobilizing the power of the whole country to suppress the rebellion; the Chinese people are eliminating this national cancer with the greatest determination. Only under this government supported by the Chinese people can a unified and strong China emerge. As mentioned earlier, the United States' China policy coincides with the wishes of the Chinese people; therefore, the strengthened implementation of the United States' China policy is not only related to the interests of the United States itself, but also sufficient to satisfy the wishes of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>What we want to point out here is that the relationship between countries should be viewed with a long-term perspective; we must not allow a country's major plans to be affected by people who only seek short-term gains. These short-sighted people often limit their vision to one corner and cannot make comprehensive plans; as a result, the short-term gains they plan to obtain will also become impossible from a longer perspective. The United States is already a country leading the world, it can only move forward, not backward. How it will shoulder this responsibility is not only related to the future of China, but also to the fate of the entire human race. We hope that American politicians can make wise decisions as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Reports of Turmoil in the British Labour Cabinet Are Inaccurate; Attlee Wins Vote of Confidence; There Is Absolutely No Such Thing as Organizing a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>Britain May Cut Military Spending to Cope with the Economic Crisis This Winter</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The House of Commons today passed a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Attlee by a large majority. The Prime Minister requested a vote of confidence due to recent announcements in the press demanding his resignation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee today told Labour Party leaders that, given the increasingly serious economic situation in the UK, Britain will reduce its military obligations in Germany, Italy, Greece, and other countries. When asked at the time whether British troops would also be reduced in Palestine, the British Prime Minister declined to answer.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 30th Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee declared today that he opposed organizing a coalition cabinet to cope with Britain's current economic crisis.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] After Prime Minister Attlee explained the plan to cope with the national economic crisis to the Labour Party members of Congress today, the government issued a communique stating that the members expressed complete satisfaction and guaranteed unanimous support for the Prime Minister to take all measures he deemed necessary. Although the details of the plan have not been announced, Attlee will explain them in the House of Commons. Previously, according to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will ask the national miners to work an extra hour each day in order to increase coal production. He will meet with the leaders of the Miners' Union tonight.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Responsible sources said today that in order to cope with the long-term economic crisis, Britain may have to resort to cutting military spending, which will have a significant impact on Britain's position in the world. At the same time, the cabinet may decide to use 2.56 billion yuan in gold and US dollar reserves. There are also rumors that Prime Minister Attlee will announce the re-election of Congress or invite the Conservative Party to join in forming a coalition government, but officials have denied this. Attlee replied to questions from members in the House of Commons today, "I saw a shocking message about me in a certain newspaper, which is completely inaccurate." Regarding British military strength, at the beginning of this month, the army, navy, and air force totaled 1,297,000 people. Chief of the General Staff Montgomery, who is inspecting the Far East, has decided to rush back early, and may submit a plan to the cabinet to cut military spending. US dollar loans will be used up in December, and the Marshall Plan for European aid will not be submitted to the US Congress for discussion until January next year. At present, the opposition Conservative Party and the newspapers that support the government are talking about the economic crisis every day, which is by no means without purpose.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] An official of the Army Department said today: This place will pay close attention to the sudden decision of Marshal Montgomery to return home. It is said that any large-scale reduction in British military personnel may affect the entire situation of world defense. The United States and Britain still have a shared responsibility in the Mediterranean, it is said.</p>

<p>This committee will be led by Eaton, chairman of the House Republican Foreign Affairs Committee. After announcing the appointment, the Speaker of the House issued a statement saying: "Congress needs to collect as much accurate information as possible on the situation in Europe and the Far East, and at the same time needs the most accurate arguments from those who are in the situation. For this reason, we have appointed a special committee to visit Europe and the Far East for inspection, and report at the second meeting of Congress. According to the second meeting has been scheduled to be held in January next year, following Martin's speech, Eaton said: In order to discuss the development of the Marshall Plan for European aid, Congress may reconvene as early as "early October." The special committee will go to Europe on August 27. The committee's investigation plan has not been announced. It is reported that the time spent abroad has been set for five weeks. The work of the committee will closely cooperate with the House Military Service Office and the Foreign Affairs Committee. The latter two are also institutions planning foreign investigation matters. Representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committee account for four of the special committee</p>

(6) Eaton has also appointed Congressman Herter as the vice chairman and general affairs director of the meeting. Due to health reasons, Eaton may not be able to go to Europe in person, and everything will be presided over by Herter. When Eaton mentioned China, he said that the future of the Far East lies in the United States and China. If the United States can help China achieve industrialization, it will be one of the greatest advances in history. He also said that the current situation in Korea is tragic and dangerous, which has never been seen in world history, but Eaton did not explain this further.</p>
<h3>Britain to Allocate Large Sums to Develop Colonial Economy</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 29th] British Colonial Secretary Jones declared in the House of Commons today: Britain will allocate 300 million pounds to various colonies in the next ten years to develop their economies.

<h3>India and Australia Successively Suggest to the Security Council to Mediate the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute; Britain and the United States Oppose Taking Drastic Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] The Indian government has already sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations Security Council today, raising the Indonesian crisis. The telegram was originally intended to be sent yesterday, but was delayed by one day at the request of the British government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 30th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley told the House of Representatives that the Australian government has instructed its representative to the United Nations Security Council, Hodgson, to urge the United Nations organization to pay attention to the situation in Indonesia. Australia is deeply concerned about the development of the Dutch East Indies, as the situation there threatens Australia's post-war peaceful development. Therefore, the representative to Lake Success has been instructed to raise this issue with the Security Council as soon as possible. It is my opinion that the Anglo-Egyptian issue still has a legitimate and effective treaty in place, so it may be postponed for a while. In Indonesia, we are already facing actual war. The consequences of delaying this conflict are truly incalculable. Therefore, I have decided to ask the United Nations organization to intervene in this dispute. Australia may raise this matter before India. We believe this is a decisive and important event that cannot be delayed for even a moment. Australia is in constant contact with the Commonwealth countries on this matter and has received encouragement from the United States. Chifley also said that Australia will soon supply Indonesia with Red Cross supplies, and a number of aircraft will be allocated for this purpose.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] A State Department official recently said that the United States "may" support India's request for the United Nations to take action to peacefully resolve the Indonesian situation. However, he solemnly pointed out that this does not mean that the United States will necessarily support everything India claims. It is believed here that India may ask the United Nations to take more forceful action before taking milder measures that Britain and the United States are willing to support. After exchanging views on the Indonesian situation, Britain and the United States agreed to take swift action, but denied that Britain or the United States intends to bring the case before the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 29th] Officials here recently denied the report by a certain news agency that China had suggested mediating the Indonesian dispute, saying that China had not made such a suggestion. However, officials confirmed that the Chinese government had expressed concern about the safety of Chinese people in Indonesia. The Dutch side has replied to the Chinese government, informing them that detailed instructions have been issued to all Dutch military commanders to strictly protect the lives and property of Chinese people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 30th] The Dutch military today released a war report stating that Dutch amphibious forces have launched a new campaign near the northern tip of Sumatra, entering a rich agricultural area. According to Japanese sources, Dutch troops moved fifteen miles south from Lawang towards Malang at dawn today, and the area is feared to fall by dusk.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Emergency Measures to Protect Overseas Chinese; Unanimously Advocates Sending Troops to the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After the outbreak of the war in the Dutch East Indies, the lives and property of overseas Chinese have suffered severely. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission attaches great importance to this and, after repeatedly consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has made a request to the Dutch government to effectively protect our overseas Chinese citizens. On the 29th, Liu Weizhi, the chairman of the commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the Executive Yuan's political meeting, requested the passage of a resolution to allocate 1 million guilders in Dutch currency for emergency relief. On the 30th, the commission convened a meeting of senior officials to discuss the issue of protecting overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and unanimously advocated that the government immediately send troops to protect them, and requested an additional allocation of 2 million guilders for emergency relief. On the 30th, the commission convened relevant agencies to discuss practical emergency measures to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Exercises its Veto Against the Establishment of a Balkan Monitoring Group; The United States Declares it Will Take Further Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 29th] Soviet representative Gromyko today used his veto in the Security Council to oppose the American proposal to establish a border monitoring committee in the Balkans. When the Council voted on the draft resolution chapter by chapter, Gromyko sat still for half an hour, taking no action, so the council members thought that the Soviet Union would not use its veto. Unexpectedly, Gromyko suddenly used his veto, causing all the previously passed introductory chapters to be discarded. This is the eleventh time the Soviet Union has used its veto in the Security Council.</p>
<p>Afterwards, US representative Johnson suggested adjourning the meeting so that the representatives could consult their governments on this "extremely serious situation". British representative Law seconded Johnson's motion, and the Security Council announced that it would reconvene at 7 pm Standard Time on Wednesday (4 am Shanghai time on Thursday). After the meeting, US representative Johnson declared that the United States did not consider the matter closed because of the Soviet Union's use of the veto. The hasty use of the veto does not change the situation in the Balkans. The US government will, as soon as possible, consider the actual situation and propose the next course of action to the Security Council. The abuse of the veto by major powers to undermine the will of the majority may encourage troublemakers in the Balkans. The Balkan Special Committee and the majority of members and councillors of the Security Council believe that the situation in northern Greece seriously threatens peace, so the Soviet Union's action has created a serious situation. It is reported that the delegations of major countries have requested instructions from their governments to deal with this situation. Before Gromyko used his veto, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria had notified the Security Council, stating that they could not accept the establishment of a Balkan border investigation committee, for the following reasons: (1) The real cause of the turmoil in Greece is internal; (2) The United Nations Charter does not allow the Security Council to exercise control over independent countries; (3) The Charter also does not allow the Security Council to force other countries to accept its proposals.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] It was learned today that after the Soviet Union used its veto in the Security Council regarding the American proposal to establish a semi-permanent inspection group to monitor the Greek border, officials here are now seeking new actions and resources to respond. US representative Johnson has been ordered by the State Department to return to Washington for consultations. It is possible that Greece will individually invite members of the Security Council to send inspectors to monitor, and it is reported that Britain and the United States are currently studying this. However, authoritative sources made it clear that the US government insists on handling the entire Greek issue within the United Nations framework. The United States will argue that the disputes between Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have already disturbed world peace, and therefore the United Nations organization must take decisive action and propose some new plans to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>World Bank to Support the Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe, President McCloy Declares</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 29th] International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy said today that the bank will use its resources to follow Secretary of State Marshall's plan and cooperate with the European economic cooperation determined by the Paris Conference. McCloy emphasized that the bank is not involved in the political aspects of the industrial reconstruction plan. The bank is concerned with stimulating general production, because restoring trade is the top priority everywhere.</p>
<p>He said that because most of the loan applications received by the International Bank cite the need for coal, the bank will pay close attention to the discussions between British and American representatives in Washington on increasing coal production in the Ruhr region. At the same time, the State Department announced that British experts participating in the discussion of the Ruhr coal production issue will leave Britain this week, and negotiations can begin as soon as possible. When asked what impact the war in Indonesia would have on the Netherlands' application for a loan, McCloy said that the application was submitted before the outbreak of the war. He pointed out that the approval of the loan depends on the economic basis, and the bank does not take any position on what is happening in Indonesia. The Netherlands has requested a loan for a three-year economic development plan, but the amount of the loan and the details have not been finalized.</p>
<p>The World Bank Releases a Balance Sheet Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The World Bank said today that it has submitted the balance sheet as of June 30, 1947, to the governments of 44 member states. The report shows that the bank's capital is US$1,604,900,000, with a total loss of US$938,647.</p>
<h3>US Mission to Greece Drafts a One-Year Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 29th] US mission to Greece leader Griswold recently said at a press conference here that although the plan currently being drafted by the mission is limited to one year, the work we are doing will exceed this time limit in terms of effectiveness. Regarding the handling of the Greek budget, although the case has been started since April 1, it has now been extended to 15 months to accommodate the mission's one-year task.</p>
<h3>Greece Convenes a Military Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 29th] Greek army commanders are scheduled to meet tomorrow in Volos, northern Greece, chaired by Chief of Staff General Vantikos, to discuss the general situation after the recent suppression of bandits. British military mission to Greece leader Major General Rawling and US military mission to Greece deputy leader General Lyner will also attend.</p>
<h3>Britain Convenes a Four-Power Meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers; The United States, France, and the Soviet Union Accept the Invitation to Exchange Views on the German Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet Union has accepted the British government's invitation to hold a four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers in London in early October to discuss the German issue. The British government's invitation was sent simultaneously to Washington, Moscow, and Paris three weeks ago. The Soviet Union was the first country to formally express its acceptance.</p>
<p>Observers believe that the development of the negotiations between Britain and the United States on the future economic situation of the British-American zone in Germany indicates that the hope of establishing a four-power agreement on unifying the German economy is still very slim. The Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to participate has guaranteed in advance that Moscow will not believe that the four-power foreign ministers' meeting scheduled to be held in London in November to discuss the German issue will be changed due to the failure of the four powers to reach an agreement on the basic issues of European economic cooperation. Since the breakdown of the talks in Paris between Bevin-Bidault-Molotov on the Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe, there have been widespread rumors that the foreign ministers' meeting in November will not be held as scheduled, so the Soviet Union's promise to participate in the four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers is of considerable significance. The British government's letter of invitation to the remaining three powers specifically pointed out that the representatives of the four-power foreign ministers, according to the instructions of the previous Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, should deal with the following three issues: (1) Preparing the procedures for the German peace treaty; (2) The German political organization; (3) The United Nations' rights and compensation in Germany. In addition, it pointed out that the Moscow Conference had requested the Berlin Allied Control Authority to submit reports on certain economic issues. It is not yet known whether these reports will be submitted to the four-power diplomatic meeting in October or directly to the foreign ministers' meeting in November.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Officials formally announced that the State Department has drafted a reply, expressing its acceptance of the British invitation and promising to participate in the four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers to be held in London on October 1 to discuss the German issue. A spokesperson said that the reply has not been finalized, but it will be submitted to London soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Although the French government is still considering the British invitation to the four-power deputy foreign ministers to meet in London on October 1 to discuss the German issue, its expression of acceptance is almost certain. People here also believe that the Soviet Union's acceptance of this British invitation has reopened some of the doors that were closed due to the refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>The European Cooperation Committee Intensifies its Investigation</h3>
<p>Questionnaires Sent to the Four Occupation Zones in Germany</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The Cooperation Committee of the Sixteen-Nation European Economic Cooperation Conference held a meeting and decided to send the questionnaires that have been sent to the sixteen member states to the commanders-in-chief of the four-power occupation forces in Germany immediately. British Cooperation Committee Chairman Frank said: The Executive Committee of the Cooperation Committee decided this afternoon to send written questions with the same content to the four commanders in Germany. This resolution has been unanimously approved by the Cooperation Committee. French Foreign Ministry Economic Director A芳 has been elected as Secretary-General, and Italy's Treynorini and Sweden's Hammarskjöld have been elected as A芳's assistants. Their task is to synthesize the replies of the various members, draft a follow-up report on the European economic situation, and submit it to Secretary of State Marshall before September 1. The sixteen member states and the four occupation zones in Germany are required to submit their replies to the written questions before midnight on August 3. Although the content of the questions has not been announced, judging from the general guidance memorandum, it can be known that the German regulatory authorities should provide figures for Germany's steel production and required coal in the next four years.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Collects German Assets in Hungary; Britain and the United States Protest to the Soviet Union; The Soviet Union Wants to Establish Closer Economic Relations with Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government has protested to the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet Union's collection of German assets in Hungary as compensation. This note has been submitted to the Soviet government by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson. Although the Potsdam Agreement and the Hungarian Peace Treaty have stipulated that all German assets in Hungary should be used as compensation to the Soviet Union, the British government believes that these assets should not be collected immediately before the Hungarian Peace Treaty officially comes into effect. It is reported that the US government has also taken similar actions against the Soviet government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 29th] Reliable sources in the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Soviet Ambassador to Italy, Kestilev, has suggested to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza that an Italian economic delegation be sent to Moscow to conduct economic negotiations with the Soviet Union. Kestilev told the Italian Foreign Minister that the Soviet Union hopes that the two countries will establish closer economic relations, and stated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the ratification of the Italian Peace Treaty is that the four powers can only deposit the instruments of ratification for the Italian Peace Treaty after the Italian Parliament has ratified the treaty itself, so that the treaty can take effect. It is expected that Foreign Minister Sforza will announce the points made by the Soviet Ambassador to the Italian Parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 29th] Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 29th that when Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met Soviet Ambassador Kestilev on the 27th, he informed him that the Italian government hoped to ratify the Italian Peace Treaty, and that Italy's participation in the Paris Conference did not have any anti-Soviet intentions. The spokesperson denied reports that Kestilev had expressed that the Soviet Union did not approve of Italy's actions, and said that this issue had not been mentioned.</p>
<h3>Hungary Prepares for General Election; Four Parties Organize a Joint Front</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 29th] The Ministry of the Interior recently announced that Hungary is scheduled to hold a general election on the 31st of the month. The four major political parties participating in the coalition government, such as the Smallholders Party, the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Peasants' Party, have decided to organize a joint front, called the "Hungarian National Independence Front General Election Grand Alliance".</p>
<h3>Royall Departs for Germany; Will Discuss the German Issue with Clay</h3>

<h3>"Original Dispute Person," Section Chief Liu of the Public Works Bureau, Testifies at the Police Station Yesterday, Provides Written Account</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Liu Junfu, Section Chief of the Public Works Bureau, the "original dispute person" in this bloodshed case, went to the police station yesterday to testify and personally described the incident to the Criminal Investigation Section of the police station. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>"At 9:30 PM on the 27th, Junfu was invited by a friend and his wife to see a play at the Jin Du Cinema. However, my friends only obtained two tickets, and I had to ask to buy one more. The theater employee said, 'No, when Xuan Tiewu came last time, he wanted to add a few, and I also said no. What department are you from? Who are you?' I took out my service card and politely asked if I could buy one more ticket. He looked at it and said with a sneer, 'No, Xuan Tiewu can't do it. You're just a civil servant.' I replied that his words were disrespectful, saying, 'Director Yi is now the garrison commander, and you keep saying Xuan Tiewu Xuan Tiewu without any courtesy. I'm going to buy a ticket with my own money, and I'm politely asking you, if you don't want to sell it, that's fine, but why be so insulting?' He said, 'What, democracy, I want to say Xuan Tiewu, Xuan Tiewu,' and shouted 'Military Police!' At that time, an armed military police comrade responded and came over. I explained the reason for asking to buy an extra ticket. The military police officer said, 'Listen to me, don't argue,' and asked the employee, 'Can you sell him one?' He said, 'No.' The military police officer said to me, 'Since he won't sell it, go, don't say anything.' I turned around and was about to walk out, and everything was fine, but unexpectedly an officer came up to me and asked, 'What's going on?' The employee said that a civil servant wanted to buy an extra ticket, and I said no, and he blamed me for being rude. I was about to explain the whole story, but the officer pushed me away and said, 'Go, what's there to say?' I said, 'Comrade, we are all civil servants. Please listen to me, okay?' At that time, a police officer interjected, saying, 'Forget it, don't make things difficult for people.' Unexpectedly, the officer got angry and said to the police officer, 'Who asked you to interfere with me? I'm an army officer. Who do you think you are? A police officer is trying to interfere.' The police officer replied, 'I can interfere.' The officer raised his hand and struck the police officer. The police officer retreated to the wall. I kept advising, 'Brother, this is a small matter. Why are you arguing? Don't say anything.' The officer lowered his hand and said to me, 'Go, it's not your business.' It was about 9:40 PM. The play had already started, and I couldn't say goodbye to my friends. I couldn't persuade them as they were arguing, so I left the theater and went home. I didn't know about the conflict that followed. The above account is entirely factual."</p>

<h3>A Witnessed Bloodshed Incident: A Police Officer Reports to the Speaker, Submitting a Written Report from All Officers</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday afternoon, Police Officer Tong Yinzhi, who witnessed the bloodshed incident in Yangpu, accompanied by police officer Fan Baiping from the reporting team, went to the Municipal Council to meet with Speaker Pan, to report the facts of the incident. He also submitted a written report from representatives of all police officers, which stated in part: "On the afternoon of the 27th, police officer Lu Yunheng, number 6588 of the Xin Cheng Branch, was on patrol duty from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM. While passing by the entrance of the Jindu Grand Theater, he saw a crowd gathered outside, obstructing traffic. He immediately stepped forward to disperse them. He then observed three citizens inside the theater arguing with the theater's ticket inspector over two tickets. He immediately stepped forward to mediate. At this time, a military police platoon leader, Li, patted Lu on the shoulder and said, 'I am here, you don't need to interfere.' Lu responded that public disputes were the police's responsibility. Platoon Leader Li pointed to his rank and said, 'I am a platoon leader of the military police corps. I am in charge of not only civilians' affairs, but also you police officers. If you are stubborn, I will give you a good beating.' Lu said, 'I am a police officer enforcing national laws. There is no explicit law that allows military police to interfere with the police, to interfere with police officers performing their duties. You should be reasonable.' Platoon Leader Li became enraged and immediately slapped Lu twice without any consideration, and ordered the other military police to surround and beat him, while patting his chest and saying, 'I am responsible if he is beaten to death.' At this time, the Jindu Grand Theater closed its iron gates, and Lu became a target for attack. Officer Qiu Shusen from the police station happened to witness this situation and immediately reported it to the Xin Cheng Branch by telephone. The branch sent officers twice to negotiate, but without success. When Lu was spitting blood and unconscious, the Jindu iron gate finally opened, and a passerby called a pedicab to take him back to the station. Lu collapsed in the duty room, with blood gushing from his mouth. To avoid escalating the situation, the duty room only sent him to the hospital for treatment. At this time, 11:30 PM, the officers on duty returned to the station one after another, and witnessed the situation. All were indignant. More than twenty colleagues, feeling that the incident was bizarre, went to Jindu together to ask Platoon Leader Li of the military police to explain what happened. Platoon Leader Li refused to answer and fired two shots as a warning. At the same time, he telephoned the military police team on Kangding Road to send reinforcements for suppression. The news spread, and colleagues from the Lao Zha and Huangpu branches rushed to the scene with a sense of condolence. Two trucks carrying reinforcements from the eighth and ninth companies of the military police arrived at the same time. More than one hundred people got out of the trucks and immediately deployed for a bloody battle. At that time, truck number 37521, loaded with fruits, was coming from the west. The deployed military police stopped it from moving forward. The driver, seeing this, was very frightened and tried to accelerate, causing the right front tire to be punctured by a military police bayonet. Colleagues became even more enraged and stepped forward to reason. Unexpectedly, the military police used their rifle butts to beat them. At this time, another military police officer opened fire on the car and the police. Xin Cheng police officer Li Zhengguang fell to the ground in response to the gunfire. At the same time, military police officers on the upper floor of the Jindu Theater also opened fire with Thompson submachine guns from the windows. The military police fired dozens of shots, causing chaos on the road. People were screaming and running, and the sounds of footsteps became a mess."</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Traitor's Jail: Permission to Send Watermelons, Limited to One Each Time; Wu Guozhang Rebuked for Smoking; Lin Kanghou Often Loses His Temper</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, this reporter visited the High Court Detention Center, where suspected traitors are being held, and obtained the following tidbits, which are recorded: The traitors' request for watermelon and ice bricks has been going on for more than a day. Previously, the head of the security section, Cheng Ying, rejected the request. However, due to the extreme heat in recent days, the traitors again sent representatives to apply. After consideration, Director Cheng asked the head of the health section, Dr. Chen Cheng, to study the matter together. Since ice bricks are divided into machine-made ice and natural ice, which are difficult to distinguish, watermelon is more hygienic. It is said that permission will be granted to send in watermelons, but the quantity will be limited to one at a time. This is indeed good news for the traitors who want to eat watermelon.</p>
<p>Chen Jicheng, the former principal of Shanghai Middle School and the puppet ambassador to Manchuria, is now the representative of the first floor. The first floor is known as the "convalescent room." Those detained there are all "elderly and virtuous" major traitors, such as Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zheng Hongnian, Tang Shoumin, Xu Weizhen, and Sun Shaokang. The daily work of the traitors is to glue matchboxes. The prison staff provides the materials to Chen Jicheng every day, and Chen distributes them to each prisoner to work on. According to the manager of a certain match factory, the products are quite well-made.</p>
<p>Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, had a craving for cigarettes in the detention center. He somehow managed to get a cigarette and was enjoying it. However, he was discovered by a guard and taken to the security section for punishment. Wu stammered, unable to complete a single sentence. He quickly admitted his mistake. Director Cheng saw that he was quite honest and spared him, but warned him not to do it again.</p>
<p>Among the elderly traitors, Lin Kanghou has the worst temper and often loses it. Su Chengde, who has been sentenced to death, is as calm as usual, and his cultivation is admirable.</p>
<h3>Accused of Supplying Cotton to the Enemy: Wu Guozhang Gets Two and a Half Years</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, was sentenced yesterday in the High Court on charges of supplying cotton to the enemy. Wu wore a light blue striped poplin suit and bowed deeply to the court. Judge Liu read the main text of the judgment: "Wu Guozhang, conspiring with the enemy to resist the country, is sentenced to two years and six months in prison, deprivation of public rights for two years, and confiscation of property except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Wu was very depressed after the sentence. The defense lawyer requested that he be allowed bail during the appeal period. The court ordered that a written application be submitted for a separate ruling. Zhou Manhua did not attend the hearing yesterday. It is said that the reason for her absence was that Wu Guozhang had instructed his defense lawyer to say, "Don't let Manhua come, she will be good material for the newspapers."</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng Invited to Broadcast: Hoping to Complete the Labor Day Movement</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, was invited by the Shanghai All Circles' Anti-Communist Nation-Building Ten Thousand Yuan Labor Day Congress to broadcast to the citizens of Shanghai from the Shanghai Radio Station on Daxi Road yesterday. He said in part that the National Army has experienced hundreds of battles, worked hard and made great achievements. Today, they still have to go to the front line and bravely sacrifice themselves. What a tragedy! What are they doing for? They are doing it for nation-building. If we do not comfort the National Army who are fighting to quell the rebellion and build the country, how can we justify it to our conscience? The population of Shanghai, including the floating population, is at least four million. What the Congress hopes for today is only one hundred million yuan, which is less than ten thousand yuan per person on average. We use a small amount of money to comfort the National Army, boost morale, end the war as soon as possible, and let the people live and work in peace. Everyone has the same heart, and everyone understands the same reason. Why hesitate? I hope that the citizens of this city, including myself, will work hard to contribute and complete this one hundred billion yuan Labor Day movement.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Regarding the case of photographer Hong Weilie being shot and killed, police officers from the Changshu Branch responsible for the investigation said that the inside story of the case was quite complicated, and no clues had been obtained after more than twenty hours of investigation. Hong had previously worked for China Electric and Lianhua Film Companies and was a skilled photographer. He had filmed famous movies such as "The Highway", "Going to Nature", and "Wild Rose".

Hong went out the night before and was shot while walking home, collapsing on the sidewalk on the south side of the Dumei Grand Theater on Du Mei Road. Police officers investigating the case told reporters that they had visited Hong's friends and General Fan Shaozeng yesterday in order to obtain clues about the case. Relevant letters related to the case were found in Hong's bedroom. Based on the various materials collected so far, it is speculated that the cause of the case may be a love affair gone wrong. As the inside story of the case was complicated, the Changshu Branch was still working hard to investigate it until late last night.</p>

<h3>Dance Hall Manager Threatened: Waiter Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yang Lin, a waiter at the Xin Dahua Dance Hall, did not collect payment for two cups of tea, and manager Sun Daren ordered him to pay compensation, which caused dissatisfaction among other waiters, Shu Yuqing and Shu Jianchang, who started collecting tea fees during the night shift. Sun Daren thought that they were deliberately creating difficulties and disrupting business, and planned to fire Yang and the other two. A few days ago, Sun suddenly received an anonymous threatening letter, which read: "To Brother Daren: Don't be arrogant and bully people, forcing us with your power. This is the democratic era, not the time of the enemy puppets. We know clearly that you are in contact with traitors and Japanese dogs. If you want to stop our business for no reason, be careful of your dog's body." Sun immediately reported the letter to the Taishan Police Branch, suspecting that Yang and the other two were heavily involved, and summoned them for questioning, ordering Yang and the others to write it again for handwriting comparison.

<h3>This Year's University Graduates Number 20,000: Employment Problems Awaiting Resolution; More Than 1,800 Have Been Selected and Sent to Various Provinces by the Ministry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education, when answering a reporter's question about the number of university graduates this year and whether there is a unified plan for their employment, said: "There is no mandatory service requirement for graduates of junior colleges and above. However, the Ministry of Education has always paid close attention to the employment of graduates of junior colleges and above. Every year, it sends letters to various agencies in advance, requesting them to hire graduates as much as possible. The agencies list the various talents they need and send them to the ministry, which then orders the relevant schools to select and send them. Therefore, the employment of graduates every year, in addition to those who continue their studies, is no more than (1) introduction by the school, (2) self-employment, (3) selection and dispatch by the provinces, and (4) distribution by the provincial education bureaus (limited to normal school students). In January of this year, the Executive Yuan issued a measure to solve the unemployment problem of college and middle school graduates, instructing that graduates of junior colleges and above should still be handled by the Ministry of Education in accordance with previous methods, and the Ministry of Education has followed the instructions. There are a total of 20,359 graduates of junior colleges and above this year, of which approximately 1,972 are normal school students who should return to their provinces to serve and whose work will be distributed by the provincial education halls and bureaus. As for the employment of other graduates, as of July 7th, the agencies that have requested the Ministry to select and send them include the Air Force Headquarters, the Ministry of Transportation, the Auditing Department, and the provincial governments of Shandong, Andong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Suiyuan. The ministry has ordered the schools to select and send 1,802 graduates. In addition, the Ministry of Water Resources can directly select 100 people from various schools, and the personnel needed by the Resources Commission will be handled directly by the commission. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has replied that many clerks are needed in the courts at all levels. Graduates of the law and political science departments who are willing to do this work this year can be assigned to the provincial higher courts for appointment, and the Ministry of Education has ordered the relevant schools to handle it. Other agencies that need graduates will still be selected and sent at any time."</p>

<h3>Silver Money Cup Table Tennis: Siming Defeats Jiaotong</h3>
<p>The second act of the final of the first Silver Money Cup Table Tennis Tournament was held at the Zhexing Table Tennis Room at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. Siming, the champion of the amateur group, competed against Jiaotong, the runner-up of the silver group. The referee was Chen Qianhao. Siming won the Bank Cup championship ten years ago and has a long-standing reputation. Recently, in the second branch league, it was unfortunately defeated by the Youjia Green Team, resulting in its elimination, which is a pity. This time, it reorganized its troops to participate in the Silver Money Cup competition, vowing to win the championship, with the idea of gaining in the willows what was lost in the mulberry. In yesterday's battle against Jiaotong, Siming relied on its elite soldiers and fierce generals, and its momentum was like a broken bamboo. Jiaotong could not withstand the opponent's iron hoofs and suffered a crushing defeat. Only team captain Zhang Jinwen managed to defeat Siming's Zhao Rungen, winning a valuable point and breaking the duck egg record. As a result, Siming won a big victory with a score of 13-1. There were no battles on the western front today, and the event will continue tomorrow. The scores of both sides are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Final Situation Largely Settled; Three Strong Teams to Make Final Decisive Battle; Table Tennis Committee to Discuss Final Matters Today</h3>
<p>The eight-strong final of the second Shanghai Table Tennis League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, was held late at night in the sweltering heat. After twenty-six rounds of round-robin battles, it is about to be completed. Currently, only one match remains for Jingwu against Huxing and Lianxing.

Second place is Huxing and Lianxing, each with a record of five wins and one loss, closely following behind. The hope of winning the championship has not been extinguished. The other five strong teams have completed their schedule and their rankings have been determined. The new army, the Green Team, jumped to fourth place, which is very rare. The strong army, Qunlian Youjia, was quite unsatisfactory in this competition, ranking fifth along with it, which can be called brothers in misfortune. Hualian Huasun suffered losses and lacked troops, and fortunately won sixth place. Youyi lost all seven games and has always worked hard, ranking last. The eight-strong situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Team Name) (Matches) (Wins) (Losses)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Disaster Relief Swimming Beauty Contest: Wu Danfeng Elected Miss Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Air Correspondent] For the past half month, Hong Kong seemed to have spent it in the rainy season, but yesterday (the 27th) the weather cleared up and the sun shone all day, so the "Swimming and Beauty Contest to Raise Funds for the Chinese and British Flood Disasters" was held as scheduled. The location was the Naval Swimming Pool, and the time was 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Last year's Miss Hong Kong, Li Lan, was selected at the Ritz. In reality, whether it was the contestants or the audience, it was far from the crazy situation of last year. However, with each ticket costing ten dollars, it is said that 1,000 tickets were sold, so the amount of charitable donations was quite a lot.</p>
<p>The swimming program had fourteen swimming events to set off the beauty pageant, including two military performance events (originally four, only the rubber lifeboat and rescue performance were held), which were a bit of a highlight. However, the swimming competition program was too bland. Several events had only three participants, and the competitive atmosphere was not high at all. The achievements were: Liu Dibing won the 100-yard freestyle championship in sixty seconds, and Luo Diwei (British Air Force) won the 100-yard backstroke championship with a graceful performance. Other than that, there were very few exciting moments.</p>
<p>The last scene of the water polo competition was a water polo confrontation between Xiangzhong and Junlian. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the result was a 4-4 tie.</p>
<p>The eye-catching Miss Hong Kong election was held before the water polo confrontation. It was originally reported that there were eighteen participants, but unexpectedly, only four participated in the on-site competition. Fortunately, He Xiuxian and Chen Anni joined temporarily, so Miss Hong Kong was born among these few.</p>
<p>Huang Lili, who was the most popular, surprisingly gave up participating, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Waiting for the ladies to dress up is a boring thing, especially waiting for Miss Hong Kong to dress up. The six ladies were in the changing room and came out after a thousand calls and ten thousand pleas.</p>
<p>The line of candidates walked around the pool in order of appearance, but He Xiuxian (No. 8), who was tall and beautiful, led the way, followed by Huang Anqi (No. 20), then Bai Lilian (No. 21), Wu Danfeng (No. 25), Zhu Liyan (No. 29), and finally Chen Anni (No. 42).</p>
<p>Walking around the pool, the ladies took delicate steps, and the audience responded with applause. On the open-air stage, the military music was melodious. They circled repeatedly in front of the judges' table to await the evaluation of the ten Chinese and Western judges.</p>
<p>The result of Miss Hong Kong: Wu Danfeng won the Miss Hong Kong title with 359 points. Chen Anni, who participated temporarily, came in second, and Zhu Liyan came in third. Finally, Commodore McFree, the naval commander, presented the awards. Miss Hong Kong Wu's resume: Miss Wu is from Shunde, Guangdong. She is twenty years old, five feet one inch tall, weighs 103 pounds, and is a girl who is interested in broadcasting. She hopes to become a singer. Chen Anni and Zhu Liyan are dancers, and Miss Zhu is from Shanghai. There is still an epilogue, which is that the film company wants to find Miss Hong Kong to appear on the screen.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Oil Business Preparatory Organization: Edible Oil Transportation and Marketing Joint Company</h3>
<p>Using Miscellaneous Grains from East China to Obtain Edible Oil from North China</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Oil Business Association, in view of the fact that the transportation, marketing, and supply of edible oil in the city are often insufficient, while the supply of miscellaneous grains is quite abundant, but the opposite is true in various parts of North China, decided to form the Shanghai Edible Oil Transportation and Marketing Joint Company in order to adjust the surpluses and deficits of each other and equalize the supply of edible oil and grain in both places. The first preparatory meeting was held at the Oil Business Association at 377 Minguo Road in this city at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 230 members attended, and Gan Simin, a commissioner from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ji Mingqi, the section chief, also attended to provide guidance. First, Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Oil Business Association, described the motivation for setting up the joint company, saying that the grain administration authorities in this city and various parts of North China also believe that the establishment of the joint company is quite necessary, so it was produced in a timely manner. Then, Gan Simin and Ji Mingqi delivered training speeches respectively, expressing their hope that they would work hard together under the new economic measures of the country to coordinate and meet the food needs of the people in East China and North China, and at the same time achieve the purpose of smooth flow of goods. Finally, Zhang Chao, Xu Zhixiang, Yang Mingzhou, Tang Wentai, Li Fuyuan, and other seventeen people were elected as preparatory committee members, and it was decided to convene a preparatory committee meeting within a few days to discuss the promotion of the matter and draft the articles of association of the joint company. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>It is reported that the joint agency will be named Shanghai Oil Business Association Edible Oil Marketing Joint Company, and the total capital will be roughly set at 1 billion national currency. The investment amount of participating members will be at least 1 million yuan per unit and at most 50 million yuan. In the future, the business route will be to exchange miscellaneous grains from the East China region, including flour, corn, broad beans, sorghum, etc., for edible oil and its raw materials from various parts of North China, including Tianjin, Yingkou, Qingdao, etc.</p>
<h3>Buyers Taking Profits at High Prices: Chinese Stocks Show Another Downtrend</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks not only failed to advance yesterday but retreated. Some brokers have reportedly been fined and suspended for two weeks starting next month. Furthermore, rumors that day's notes could not be used for settlement intensified. Active traders rushed to cut their long positions, and younger traders took advantage of the situation to sell aggressively. By late morning, the market ultimately proved unsustainable. Except for miscellaneous stocks that remained stable, all hot stocks significantly declined.</p>
<p>At the opening, only Qinxing showed a slight increase. The rest opened lower. Soon after, Diyong Yarn saw frequent liquidations by brokers numbered 104, 223, 76, and 85, pushing the price down to 233 yuan. Brokers numbered 160, 154, 171, and 157 bought in, resulting in a slight rebound. Brokers numbered 85, 223, 76, 143, 100, 4, and 224 sold again at 229 yuan.</p>
<p>After 9:20 a.m., brokers numbered 180, 171, 97, 218, and 174 advanced to 235 yuan, while brokers numbered 19, 223, 4, 160, and 85 continued to sell. From 10:00 a.m. to 10:20 a.m., the market remained in a prolonged tug-of-war, fluctuating until 10:25 a.m. After that, brokers numbered 16, 154, 45, 50, and 12 all bought in, and broker numbered 160 bought back after selling. Diyong Yarn briefly rebounded to around 240 yuan, but brokers numbered 157, 22, 85, 152, 231, 142, and 219 continued to liquidate their positions.</p>
<p>After 11:45 a.m., Yong Yarn retreated to around 230 yuan. Brokers numbered 152, 160, 155, and 172 remained actively engaged. Brokers numbered 185 and 152 again strongly sold the current Yong Yarn, but the market still looked unsustainable. The price of other secondary stocks continued to decline, with a particularly severe drop in the small-cap stock Huafeng, due to rumors that broker number 107 would abandon its management.</p>
<p>Before the closing, the current Yong Yarn fell to a low of 222 yuan, and the delayed Yong Yarn fell to a low of 225 yuan. The market then closed at 223 yuan and 226 yuan, respectively. After the closing, brokers numbered 222, 8, and 32 sold, and bidding became slightly weaker. Compared to the previous closing price, current delivery shares saw Qinxing slightly increase, Yong Yarn and Xinhua slightly decrease, Jingfu, Zhongfa, and Yonggong each fall by about half a percent, Meiya and Xinguang fall by less than one percent, Huafeng and Xinhe fall by one percent, Guohuo saw little trading but remained flat, Wuhe Underwear, Datong, Liyan Matches, Zhongfang, and Jinglun saw very minor declines, and Shangwu, Zhongsi, Tongyi, and Rongfeng each fell by between half a percent and slightly less than one percent.</p>
<p>In delayed delivery trading, Huafeng and Yonggong fell by slightly less than one percent, and Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell by slightly more than half a percent. Over-the-counter trading saw minor fluctuations in old shares, with the majority remaining flat.</p>
<h3>Jiufu Pharmaceutical: New Shares Listed</h3>
<p>The stock exchange yesterday announced three items in the market: (1) Market trading hours will be changed from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. starting today, including Saturdays. (2) Jiufu Pharmaceutical's new shares will also be listed starting today, with the trading unit temporarily set at 10,000 shares. (3) Broker No. 61's agent, Chen Yan, disrupted market order and was fined with a two-week suspension from entering the market, until August 12th.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Surge: Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public debt prices surged because Western newspapers made quite critical comments about China's bond repayment, causing renewed anxiety. The C-bond went from an opening price of 8,800 yuan to a high of 10,300 yuan before slightly retreating. Room 555 had supplies, while Room 360, Dacheng, and the Chaozhou group absorbed them. Compared to the previous closing, A and B bonds rose by 700 yuan, C bonds rose by 900 yuan, D bonds rose by 600 yuan, and E bonds also rose by 800 yuan, with a total trading volume of around 3 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly weak yesterday. Paper and rubber stocks both saw declines. Foreign merchants and banks were taking in profits, while securities firms and retail investors were selling. Yisha opened at a high of 80,500 yuan and then rose to 83,300 yuan before slightly stabilizing. Compared to the previous closing, Yeguang and Telephone were flat, Yisha, Wheelock, Shipping, and Steel saw minor declines, British Union and Yifu each fell by half a percent, and Paper alone fell by one percent.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth sales remained sluggish. Merchants from Fujian even sold off their goods. Major players, seeing the unfavorable environment, were less active. Thus, the market was dominated by retail investors buying and selling. Furthermore, it was rumored that the Economic Police Brigade would start operations on August 1st, causing extreme anxiety. Dragon Head Fine Cloth recovered from 431,000 yuan to close at 434,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 yuan from yesterday. Other colored cloths and Shilin cloths saw no significant changes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton yarn as usual. The market was weak from the start. As demand was slack, prices gradually declined, but the fluctuations were minor. Furthermore, the prices of securities and other commodities fell considerably, further weakening market sentiment. 20-count lightweight yarn fell from 10.75 million yuan to close at 10.65 million yuan, a decrease of 250,000 yuan. Other yarns also saw small decreases of between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained weak, with depressed sentiment. Due to the weakness in yarn and cloth, customers were eager to sell, resulting in very soft prices. Yarn factories showed no interest in buying, leading to quiet trading. The quoted prices for warehouse delivery were: L.S.S. 2.16 million, Shashi 2.06 million, Lingbao 2.15 million, Han Fine 1.93 million to 1.96 million, Zhangde 2.00 million, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton 333,000.</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Association Hopes for the Textile Adjustment Committee to Return Advances</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday. During the meeting, it was noted that various yarn factories had advanced significant funds for the purchase and contract spinning of cotton allocated with foreign exchange in the second quarter by the Wheel Management Committee's import quota distribution. The association hoped that the Textile Adjustment Committee would follow the original agreement and promptly return the funds already settled in foreign exchange (totaling over 600 billion national currency) to facilitate turnover. For the unsettled foreign exchange portion, the association hoped that the government would handle it directly to maintain credibility with foreign merchants. The issue of cotton yarn pricing was also discussed. It was generally agreed that unless flexible pricing is implemented and the cost of reproduction is taken into account, the entire cotton textile industry would not be able to survive.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Allocates Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Committee. A total of 596 pieces were allocated to manufacturers, with 97 purchase applications.</p>
<h3>Textile Management Convenes Final Meeting to Discuss Disposition of Remaining Funds Totaling Over 100 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The former Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled its final meeting for 4:00 p.m. today at the City Hall to discuss the disposition of over 100 billion yuan in remaining funds from the Committee's previous purchase of cotton yarn for distribution, in order to conclude the matter. During the tenure of the former Premier of the Executive Yuan, the government purchased half of the cotton yarn spun by various factories using their stockpiled cotton, and the proceeds from the distribution were accumulated to develop the national cotton textile industry and promote cotton planting. At that time, a foundation management committee was established. Before and after the establishment of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the former Textile Management Committee repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions on how to dispose of the fund, but no approval has been received. To resolve this matter as soon as possible, the Committee has scheduled its final meeting this afternoon to discuss how to handle it.</p>
<h3>Inland Tianjin Merchants Buying Up: Rice Prices Rise Across the Board Both Japonica and Indica See Increases of 30,000 to 40,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 3,000 shi of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Inland Tianjin merchants were actively purchasing, causing prices to soar. The Shanghai market responded enthusiastically, tracking the increases. Japonica rice prices rose sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while Indica rice prices rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. White rice and No. 1 rice both saw increases of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sales in the North market were more active, reigniting the upward trend.</p>
<p>Flour transported from inland areas to the north also saw gradual movement in Shanghai, with continued increases of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran was sluggish and stable. Soybean cakes were tight at the opening but ultimately lacked strength to rise due to sluggish actual sales, remaining flat at noon. Soybeans rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans saw limited supply and demand, remaining high but sluggish. Red beans rose and fell sharply, retreating by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. After consecutive declines, the arrival of broad beans gradually decreased, leading to slight movement and a gradual recovery, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw peanuts from Southeast Asia were active and volatile, surging by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sorghum demand exceeded supply, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn also rose along with other commodities, recovering by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market saw weak sales in other regions. Local demand was moving but not strong. However, sellers held firm, with crude oil, soybean oil, light sesame oil, and rapeseed oil all increasing by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Society Expedites Processing of Rice for Factories, Etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market suddenly fluctuated, with prices rising across the board. Wu, the chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, in order to stabilize rice prices, specifically ordered the Allocation Committee yesterday to promptly allocate rice to factories, schools, and other organizations that had applied for rice based on the number of people in each household, and then review the applications, so that the applicant households could obtain rice and avoid being threatened by rice market price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Food Supplies Decreasing Among UNRRA Materials</p>
<p>Recently, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that food supplies among UNRRA relief materials shipped to China have been decreasing. In the previous year, rice, wheat, and coarse grains accounted for the majority, but this year, transportation equipment and agricultural supplies will take the lead. From the 21st to the 26th of last week, the agency reportedly distributed various materials in this city, with food supplies totaling only 45 tons. Transportation equipment and agricultural equipment accounted for the majority, totaling approximately 8,400 tons. Fuel was even scarcer, at only 16 tons. In total, the agency distributed 18,804 tons of various relief materials to this city and other locations last week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Lumber Weak</h3>
<p>Foreign lumber prices are weak due to continuous arrivals. Although the production cost of fir wood is not low, the market price is difficult to raise due to the summer season.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture: Ministry of Economic Affairs License Received</h3>
<p>However, Government Prepared Loan Funds Have Not Been Allocated</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since receiving government support, the China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture has been gradually expanding its business according to the company's planned schedule. The company recently received its official business license No. 4224 from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is reported that the company plans to gradually promote all its products to Southeast Asia before MacArthur opens Japanese foreign trade, in order to win back the original overseas market for domestically produced cotton textiles. However, there are still two difficulties: (1) The government's prepared loan funds for cotton yarn raw materials and processing have not yet been allocated, making it impossible for the company's affiliated factories to start production. (2) It is reported that the cotton textile markets in Southeast Asia are currently mostly occupied by British, American, and Indian products. In terms of price, domestic products appear to be at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3>Rayon Weakens Again: Factory Brokers Still Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon prices were fluctuating, ultimately falling by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Broker number 120 traded Gaoshan and Asahi brands with luster in the morning at 24.5 million to 24.6 million yuan, with a minimum of 400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the final price was 4.5 million yuan, with some trading among colleagues. Silk factories showed very little interest, and trading was very sparse.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for factory-produced silk remained quiet. High-grade uniform silks only had quoted prices but no transactions. Medium-grade other silks were traded yesterday at a price of 27.5 million yuan, and high-grade other silks were also traded at 28.5 million yuan. A small quantity of 28-part other silks was traded at 17.5 million yuan. Silk factories traded 20 dan of Changtu silk yesterday, with the August delivery price set at 5.05 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for mesh silk scarves was initially strong but then retreated, ultimately falling by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Huakang brand opened at 10.7 million yuan and was traded, but then fell to between 6.5 million and 6.6 million yuan. After large players dumped their holdings, it fell further to a minimum of 5.2 million to 5.3 million yuan. Multiple parties made efforts to push the price up, and it recovered to 6 million yuan. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell again, with the final price being 5.4 million yuan and the forward price being 5.7 million yuan. Dacheng brand opened at 7.2 million yuan and was traded, then traded at 6.5 million yuan, with the final spot price being 5.9 million yuan. Dacheng Gezi Bi Chou opened with a quoted price of 5,500 yuan, then traded at 5,200 yuan, with the final quoted price being 4,800 yuan. Other goods remained stable and unchanged.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Rayon Shipped from Japan</p>
<p>A large batch of Japanese rayon has recently arrived and is stored in customs warehouses awaiting inspection. According to reporters, the rayon is expected to be fully inspected soon and transported to storage warehouses by the China Trust Bureau. Distribution is expected to begin early next month. The distribution price has not yet been determined, and the China Trust Bureau and the sales agents have been discussing it for days. Technical aspects of distribution are also being studied and improved to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Bans Same-Day Credit for Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city's banking and commercial association recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that general banks and firms have recently been accommodating requests from various customers to allow same-day credit for negotiable instruments presented for deposit. This has resulted in credit inflation, and during periods of tight credit, banks and firms, due to the same-day credit of negotiable instruments, have often failed to accurately estimate their own working capital. As a result, if a dishonored check is returned, it often easily shakes the security of the bank or firm itself. Therefore, the practice of same-day credit for negotiable instruments should be investigated and prohibited. The Banking Association has recently sent notices to its member banks to comply.</p>
<h3>National Bank Circular Designates Banks: Instructs on Three Key Points for Foreign Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank recently distributed Circular No. 107 to designated banks, stating in brief: It has been reported that some designated banks have been settling foreign exchange before irrevocable letters of credit or purchase commissions have been opened and before all import cargo shipping documents have been provided, based solely on import licenses. If true, this clearly violates the provisions of Circular No. 56 issued by the Bank on October 2 of last year. Therefore, the following three points are specifically emphasized:</p>
<p>1. Designated banks must first verify whether the applicant has the following qualifications before selling foreign exchange:</p>
<p>(1) The imported goods are within the scope specified in the import license and can definitely arrive at the port within three months, with an irrevocable letter of credit or purchase commission opened.</p>
<p>(2) The goods have already arrived at the port and have all shipping documents.</p>
<p>2. Designated banks must strictly comply with the provisions of the import license.</p>
<p>3. If there are amendments or supplementary clauses to the import license, they are only valid if they are signed by the relevant personnel of the Import Temporary Management Committee.</p>
<p>Designated banks that violate the above regulations will be subject to penalties.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively stable with little fluctuation. The association's quoted prices were: No. 20 medium sand, 565,000 to 580,000 yuan per 100 bags; Red bag packing, 565,000 to 570,000 yuan; 24 coarse white, 700,000 yuan per 1,000 bags; Shantou packing, 630,000 yuan; Four and a half white, 660,000 to 665,000 yuan, all showing a recovery. There was no stock of three and a half white. Shantou Qingyang, 420,000 to 415,000 yuan and 410,000 yuan; Cotton red, 450,000 yuan. Xinghua white high, 580,000 yuan; second grade, 510,000 to 520,000 yuan. Xing red, 435,000 to 430,000 yuan. A total of over 300 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions were quite sluggish yesterday. Wholesale business was affected by continued increases in quoted prices for autumn and winter goods, and actual sales were still pending. At the same time, as the overdraft contract period for banks and firms expires at the end of this month, credit is not easing. Retail business was affected by the successive declines in summer sales. The woolen fabric market on Qipan Street and Changle Teahouse showed no improvement.</p>
<h3>Few Export Tea Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions in the export tea market were still sparse. Most exporters in this city were still busy handling the recent shipment of 900 tons of Zhenmei green tea to Morocco, so buying interest was subdued. The attitude of sellers was calm, and prices were similar to the previous day. As for the various domestic sales teas that have been selling well in recent days, sales remained very active in the hot weather. Low-grade black tea was in particularly strong demand in the Wuxi area. Due to the sellers' insistence, prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Silk Industry Applies for Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 29th] The silk weaving, silk fabric, and electric machinery industries have applied to the Joint Four Banks for a production loan of 11 billion to relieve their working capital problems. In addition, the Hangzhou Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture, following Shanghai, is also actively preparing to open.</p>
<h3>Civilian Coal Allocation Prices to Be Adjusted Again Soon</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Zhang Xiwei, left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday to attend a coal production increase meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The civilian coal allocation meeting in this city will be convened after Chairman Zhang returns to Shanghai. It is reported that civilian coal allocation prices will be adjusted again. However, the allocation prices for public utilities will remain unchanged. Because the previous adjustment of coal allocation prices affected public utilities, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to subsidize the Fuel Management Committee and ordered that the allocation prices for public utilities must remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>National Cement Industry Applies for Priority Allocation of Fuel Oil</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the National Cement Industry Association, the rotary kilns used by cement factories to produce clinker are now mostly fueled by diesel, with a substantial monthly demand. In the past, factories relied on Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil of New Jersey, China Petroleum, and other companies for allocation, but the supply of origin has been insufficient. If priority allocation is not given in the future, factories will be on the verge of shutdown due to insufficient fuel. The National Cement Association believes that cement is an important national defense industry, and with the post-war construction boom, cement demand has surged. Government authorities have unanimously placed high expectations on it. Its importance is no less than that of public utilities and transportation. The obligations and responsibilities of the factories to the country are incomparable to ordinary circumstances. Without sufficient fuel, how can production be increased to support construction? Yesterday, the association's Deputy Secretary-General Xi Zhengxi visited Director Deng and Secretary Wu of the Diesel Allocation Committee to personally present the industry's special difficulties and make two requests: (1) For cement industry fuel needs, please consider the national interest and grant priority allocation. (2) In addition to approving the previous diesel purchase orders from oil companies, please allocate the shortfall to maintain production. Director Deng has promised to pay attention to the matter.</p>
<p>The association's Shanghai, China, Jiangnan, Huaxin, Sichuan, Tianxiang, Shunchang, and Jianya member factories require a total of 8,050 tons of diesel per month.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Last year, the cement industry was heavily hit by the dumping of foreign goods. This spring, due to government restrictions on imports, sales have gradually become brisk. In order to maximize supply to meet the needs of all parties, factories have been actively increasing production in recent months. Currently, national production has more than doubled compared to the beginning of the year. Jiangnan, Huaxin, and other factories are also expected to start production within the year. It is projected that by next spring, domestically produced cement can be exported to Southeast Asia. However, recently, cement sales have become weak again. The output of various factories has mostly exceeded demand. The biggest reason for this is that many construction projects have been suspended. It is rumored that a party intends to request permission for the import of Japanese cement. The association and all its members are closely monitoring the situation. If this actually happens, it will affect the national economy and the survival of the cement industry, and they will resolutely oppose it.</p>

<h3>Starting from the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>— Translated by Changsong</p>
<p>Translated from the July 1947 issue of Reader's Digest</p>
<p>Although the foundation for the German and Austrian peace treaties was laid early in the Atlantic Charter, the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Agreements, and the United Nations Charter, the Moscow Conference, originally convened to draft the German and Austrian peace treaties, failed to reach an agreement even on the principles upon which these treaties should be based.</p>
<p>What this conference did accomplish was to put the goals of Russia and the Western nations to a decisive test. And this test proved that while the wartime alliance had won the war, it could not forge peace, leaving the world to linger in a state of uncertainty and frustration.</p>
<p>The origins of this deadlock are now recorded in history. The wartime agreements proposed the establishment of a demilitarized, denazified, and democratized Germany, part of whose territory must be ceded, politically decentralized, and economically dispersed, but which would still be a political entity and an economic unit. It would pay reparations from its surplus industrial capital equipment, but would still be able to survive without external assistance. The wartime agreements also proposed the establishment of an independent and free Austria, enjoying the treatment of a liberated nation, specifically exempting it from making reparations.</p>
<p>In the Moscow Conference, the United States and Britain sought to achieve these goals through a democratic Germany. This Germany would be composed of various states with a degree of autonomy, governed by a federal government with extremely limited powers—ensuring that Germany, without excessive industrial development, could adequately support its already increased population, as excessive industrial development might once again threaten European peace. To demonstrate its goodwill, the United States put forward an unprecedented proposal: that the four powers conclude a long-term alliance to ensure the continued disarmament of Germany, thereby safeguarding the security of all. France's views on this plan were very close, leading to an almost unanimous unity among the Western nations.</p>
<p>Russia, however, held a very different position from the United States and Britain, denying the wartime agreements concerning Germany and Austria. It also sought to impose new conditions on the defeated nations and its victorious allies. It criticized the incorporation of the Saar coal region into the French economic unit as "dismembering" Germany, while insisting on its own and Poland's annexation of nearly a quarter of Germany's arable land, and vehemently advocating the expulsion of the people in that region to the remaining part of Germany. As a result, the Western nations would be forced to rebuild Germany's industry and promote its exports, even competing with their own export industries, or the Western nations would have to spend money to feed the Germans themselves; otherwise, they would only let them starve and push them into the embrace of communism.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia insisted that Germany should pay reparations of more than 30 billion US dollars worth of goods at current market prices, most of which should be obtained from current production, with half of the total reparations going to Russia. This was tantamount to saying that the Western nations must first invest capital to build up Germany's industry in order to produce so much surplus material, and then allow Russia to seize control of this industry through reparations.</p>
<p>Russia also advocated the establishment of a highly centralized German state, modeled after Russia's own system, governed not only by the party that wins the majority but also by trade unions dominated by the Communist Party and the commonly seen Communist Party line organizations of "democracy" and "anti-Nazism."</p>
<p>Within its sphere of influence, Russia seized all Austrian assets nominally labeled "German-owned," intending to maintain its strong control over Austria through this means. It used the obstruction of the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty as a means to achieve its goal of maintaining troops in Vienna and on the "transportation lines" throughout the Balkans.</p>
<p>Russia's conditions are an undisguised plan to dominate Europe. Its ambitions have created a chasm between it and the West. The current serious situation of the German and Austrian question is by no means the only symbol of the existence of this chasm.</p>
<p>The same chasm is evident in the Balkans. Although Russia had solemnly guaranteed during the war to give liberated Europe the opportunity to elect free governments based on popular will, it is now turning the Balkan countries into possible Soviet republics.</p>
<p>This chasm is also evident in Poland. The free elections promised to Poland by the Potsdam Conference have turned into a democratic farce. And the Lublin Group, under Russia's wings, has even abandoned the pretense of a government that follows the will of the majority.</p>
<p>The chasm is also evident in China. Russia's promise to provide military and moral support exclusively to the National Government in exchange for China's concession of rights to Russia, under the instigation of the United States, has now been thrown to the winds.</p>
<p>The chasm is also evident in Korea. The original plan was to help Korea become an independent and liberated nation, but Russia has kept Korea divided, and seeks to place Korea under its control through methods even more blatant than those used in Germany.</p>
<p>The chasm is also evident in the deadlock over the atomic issue. The United States proposed handing over the atomic bomb under appropriate safeguards for joint control, but Russia has consistently refused. The chasm also exists in the work of the United Nations. Russia's use of its veto power and refusal to participate in the work of various subsidiary bodies has almost paralyzed the United Nations. The chasm is also evident in Russia's efforts to delay the organization of an international security force.</p>
<p>In short, all of the above are molded from a universally consistent model, and this policy model has absolutely nothing to do with security. Its determination is clearly due to two main driving forces—Russia's traditional imperialism and a fanatical communism. The latter sees the world outside the Soviet Union as an enemy and anticipates the inevitable outbreak of world revolution. Indeed, Russia is not only pursuing goals that contradict its wartime guarantees, but its ambitions expand proportionally whenever a potential enemy shows weakness.</p>
<p>Russia's territorial, political, and economic gains are already the greatest any empire has ever acquired after any war, but Russia is still not satisfied and continues to pursue its expansion plans—such as using diplomatic and military pressure in Germany and Austria; using puppet governments in Eastern Europe; carrying out infiltration, fifth column activities, and internal unrest in Greece and China; and deliberately obstructing every effort to build peace. If the intention is to keep the world mired in turmoil and economic hardship until the time is ripe for the implementation of communism, then this is truly the best policy.</p>
<p>The current situation reveals a glimmer of hope. It is a completely credible fact that Russia not only lacks the capacity for war, but also does not want war. Experience tells us that Russia will yield when it encounters genuine resistance, as evidenced by the examples of Iran and Trieste. If the Western nations are to find a way to break the current deadlock, this tactical flexibility of Russia must be a point that Western policy should grasp.</p>
<p>The policy of the Western nations must be based on three basic principles. They must agree to fill the void to prevent further expansion of Russian influence, because the current balance of power has reached such a delicate stage that if another nation submits to Russia's dominance, it could easily lead to a one-sided shift of European continental nations towards Russia. Secondly, the Western world must seek to organize itself and all countries willing to join together to work for peace, trade, and prosperity, while not abandoning the countries now behind the curtain. Because only in this way can the West not only regain its solvency, but also demonstrate to Russia the benefits of joining us. Finally, in terms of policy, all of Russia's legitimate interests must be given careful consideration to avoid excessive hostility, as such hostility will cause danger.</p>
<p>Based on such a policy, there is still hope of breaking the current deadlock, and there is still ample room for Russia and the West to reach agreements and cooperate for their common interests. Moreover, the greatest hope for maintaining the United Nations and the concept of global unity lies only in such a policy.</p>
<h3>Visiting a Scientific Inventor: Hollywood Dreams of Chinese Dance</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Hollywood Airmail</p>
<p>A few months ago, an old educator in an issue of "Observer's Magazine" loudly exclaimed: "If we in the American education community cannot control Hollywood, then all of America will be swallowed up by Hollywood!" Today, students in American schools are far more interested in watching movies than in attending classes. The intangible education of movies not only surpasses the influence of school education, but also outweighs the effectiveness of parents' well-intentioned family education. Fifteen-year-old children are capable of killing people with guns and erasing all traces of the murder. Eight or nine-year-old girls actually wiggle their butts on the street, imitating South American dances. Old producer Zanuck of 20th Century Fox said, "Hollywood movies defeated the Axis powers. In the future, the responsibility facing Hollywood professionals is how to win peace? How to build a new world that is forever without war, without hatred, and without starvation!"</p>
<p>The Larmore Couple</p>
<p>I put these questions to a "Hidden Dragon Mountain Man" in Hollywood, a scientific genius, a literary figure, and also an artist, Gilbert Larmore. He lives in a beautiful and exquisite small Western-style building by the shimmering Pacific Ocean, built on a hillside by the sea. The day my friend Rouland took me to see him, we first ate at a rural restaurant on the Pacific coast. Many Americans with leisure time drove dozens of kilometers to this place to feel a little sea breeze and then spend their "weekend" here. That evening, Larmore and his wife happened to be there too. My impression of him was a large man with the demeanor of a "modest gentleman," speaking very decisively and forcefully.</p>
<p>He is the inventor of Sonovox. I don't know how to translate this word properly into Chinese! "Sound amplifier" or "electric sound transmitter" is probably what it means. According to Larmore, he noticed this problem about ten years ago. He saw many deaf-mutes who could not speak and felt endless sympathy in his heart. He said: The production of human voice has two sources: one is the "sound" produced by the vibration of the vocal cords, and the sound passes through the throat and the teeth, tongue, lips, etc., in the "oral cavity" to produce "tones." Tones are different, but the sound is the same. If a deaf-mute who cannot speak because the vocal cords are damaged and cannot vibrate, his "sound amplifier" can use artificial vocalization. It is a two-and-a-half-inch-long electric vibrator that is placed between the throat and neck, close to the skin, causing it to vibrate and affecting the vibration of the "vocal cords." The deaf-mute only needs to make various gestures with his mouth, teeth, tongue, and lips, and the sound will come out like a normal person.</p>
<p>Mrs. Larmore performed a demonstration for her husband, and then he explained the principle behind it himself. I said: The principle is very simple, but to invent something, the details are definitely beyond the understanding of an "outsider." His machine is now being manufactured in large quantities in Chicago. He said that there are six million deaf people in the United States, and at least some of them can get great help.</p>
<p>Electric Sound Transmitter</p>
<p>Movie sound transmitters are now slowly being applied to movies, especially supernatural, detective, and horror movies. A person can speak with the "sound" of a dog barking (plus the "tone" of a person), or can speak with the sound of a raging wind. The sound of a dog barking or a raging wind is recorded onto a phonograph record. When the phonograph is turned on, it is connected to an electrical appliance and then connected to the sound transmitter with an electrical wire, which creates this vibration of sound. Mrs. Larmore's performance that day was indeed a bit chilling.</p>
<p>"Electric sound transmitters" have already been widely adopted on radio stations, which are used to broadcast two merged sounds. I saw a radio weekly with a large article praising Larmore.</p>
<p>In fact, Larmore is not really engaged in science. Saying he is a scientist is not as appropriate as saying he is a "writer." He lives in Hollywood, the world of gold, and mostly makes a living by writing movie scripts. He is a person who became wealthy through writing. Although he said that he hates capitalist society, he has a fairly "rich" family.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about various topics. He has a talent for conversation because he thinks quickly and has many extraordinary opinions. He said: "Living on the same planet, there was originally no difference between humans and animals, but later, so-called animals only knew how to use their limbs to use or enjoy materials. Humans can use materials to turn materials into tools, and then use tools to inspire other materials. Therefore, humans conquered animals and became the 'spirit of all things.'"</p>
<p>He cited many names of strange animals from South America and Africa. Many animals are almost like humans, able to stand and walk, and able to have their own communal society, but no matter what, they cannot use materials to become tools.</p>
<p>Larmore never goes to church. He is a broad-minded "skeptic," but he does not deny morality and education. He is not as pessimistic about the development trend of the film industry as those old educators. He said: "This is a progress of human intelligence. The film industry has developed to this day after decades, and we can no longer go backwards and persuade young people not to watch movies. As for the selection and choice of script content, he believes it is a very crucial topic."</p>
<p>He can write a script on average every two months. The script also needs to be promoted to film companies by an "agent." In addition, he also writes for radio stations. The radio industry and the film industry are a pair of twin brothers who make money in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>Close Cooperation is Needed between Chinese and American Film Industries</h3>
<p>Hollywood has about dozens of broadcasting companies, all of which are large-scale and large-venue. Singer Bing Crosby's income, movies account for a small part, broadcasting and recordings account for the majority. During my hurried trip to Hollywood, I also visited several broadcasting companies, which have large-scale orchestras and various singing scenes.</p>
<p>There are very few Chinese people engaged in broadcasting work in Hollywood. However, in terms of film technology, there is an amazing genius, "Jim Wong." I don't know what his Chinese name is. In three days, I called him more than ten times, but I couldn't meet him. He is currently a cameraman at Warner Bros. When people in Hollywood talk about "Jim Wong," everyone gives a thumbs up: "The number one cameraman in color photography!"</p>
<p>I did not meet Sun Yu, Li Lili, and their group. They probably arrived there shortly after I left Los Angeles, but I sincerely hope that they can truly lay a foundation for Sino-American film cooperation. I remember meeting Mr. Zheng Yongzhi in New York last October. Zheng very forcefully said that he opposed using the words "film cooperation." At the time, I was quite skeptical of his opinion. After arriving in Hollywood this time, I am even more convinced that cooperation between the film industries of China and the United States is needed.</p>
<p>Cooperation is Not Dependence</p>
<p>Cooperation is not all about dependence. Our equipment and technology are far behind. If we say that we need to build up the Chinese film industry, we must humbly learn from Hollywood. In the past one or two decades, not only has there been insufficient cooperation, but there has not even been a foundation for cooperation, which is why Hollywood has developed all sorts of erroneous views that look down on China. Producer Kennedy of Columbia Pictures hired a Chinese actor as the lead, which was met with a lot of criticism. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox have made many movies about China, using "foreigners" with high noses and blue eyes in makeup. Hollywood has theatrical talent from all over the world. Why don't we have talent from China? Of course, Chinese actors have difficulties with language and writing when acting in English plays, but this is not an insurmountable problem. The current top American actress Ingrid Bergman, the lead actress in "The Bells of St. Mary's," was born and raised in Sweden. When she first arrived in the United States, she didn't understand any English. Later, with the help of a private tutor and her own hard work, she is now not only fluent in dialogue on the screen like an American, but also her tickets for her stage play performance in New York this March were sold out last November.</p>
<p>Besides Ingrid Bergman, Carmen Miranda, a Brazilian glamorous woman, is also an example. When she first entered Hollywood, she only spoke Brazilian Portuguese, and only a few English words. Now she can not only act in any dialogue, but also sing expressive English love songs. Why can't our domestic top actors be promoted to Hollywood through Sino-American film cooperation? Why can't they show their talents on this world stage? Why do we always let those overseas Chinese actors, who claim to represent China in Hollywood, specialize in playing roles such as servants, errand boys, and rickshaw pullers?</p>
<p>Chinese Dance</p>
<p>One evening in Hollywood, a few American friends invited me to dinner at the "Deauville" cafe. An American film industry insider said that he had never seen Chinese dance. He asked: "Did China ever have 'dance' before?" Another American said: "China has Han and Tang Dynasty 'court dances.' He has seen pictures, and the scene in the pictures is very grand, but he has never seen it in drama and film!"</p>
<p>I am not saying that the overseas Chinese actors' skills are not good enough. In fact, they also want to promote a little Chinese art everywhere. However, because they understand too little about China, their style is mostly Western. What the American audience wants is not a yellow-skinned person acting in their style, but a longing for a little bit of genuine Chinese drama and art.</p>
<p>International understanding and international cooperation are built up bit by bit. We must not let others despise China spiritually before licking the pitiful alms of others. Take Hollywood, for example. It is a microcosm of the international stage. The impression a Hollywood movie gives to people around the world is no less profound than the speech of a diplomat, and no less important than a famous book by a writer. We have diplomats who speak fluent English abroad, writers who write fluent English, and representatives of various English-speaking industrial and commercial sectors, but we have forgotten Hollywood, such an important educational and propaganda institution!</p>
<p>Penetrating the Whole World</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Hollywood was still an unnoticed barren village on the Pacific coast. Eighty years ago, it was said to be a desert everywhere, and water had to be drawn from small streams in the mountains. Now, in a few decades, it has become the city with the largest flat area in the world, and the most luxurious and noblest city in the world. Municipal experts in Los Angeles predict that the population may exceed New York in five years. They are already designing and building the most modern roads, with no intersections, no traffic lights, and four parallel avenues. There have been no earthquakes for more than ten years, and Hollywood people believe there will be no more natural disasters. Transportation is convenient, and they can fly to New York in seventeen and a half hours. Many big entrepreneurs, they fly from New York to Los Angeles, and then fly back to New York from Los Angeles. They control this propaganda nerve center, and they influence the young people of the whole world!</p>
<p>I lived in Los Angeles and Hollywood for nine days. In early spring and late winter, Hollywood streets are full of the true colors of singing and dancing. Girls wearing long pants hum Spanish love songs, and the streets are full of: palm trees every five steps, banana trees every ten steps, green and lush, and you can't see the desolation and bleakness of deep winter. I spent a lively evening in the "Mocambo" nightclub, surrounded by many men and women. "Danny Kaye," who used to be in the film industry for several years, the milk delivery boy in "Up in Arms." Some people say that he is an elusive person. He had just become famous in the film industry, but suddenly stopped and joined the nightclub!</p>
<p>Nightclubs, bars, cafes, restaurants, in this paradise of drunken money, you can't see sorrow, you can't see worry. The blood and sweat money of the whole world is nourishing the prosperity of Hollywood. The intangible influence of Hollywood is penetrating the whole world bit by bit!</p>

<p>Health examinations are the implementation of this principle. Perhaps you will doubt the doctor's diagnosis because you have no symptoms and feel the same as ordinary people. This is a misconception. Many people have lung disease without any conscious symptoms. If you have to wait for the symptoms to become obvious, the disease has usually reached a considerable extent, and it may be difficult to treat. Even if it can be treated, it will require a longer period of time and more major surgery. Therefore, if a lung disease is detected during an examination, do not delay or harbor a mentality of luck, or temporarily wait and see, waiting for symptoms to appear before seeking treatment. By then, it may be too late. Early lung disease can be cured in about eight out of ten people. Late lung disease can be cured in at most three out of ten people. Treating a disease is like putting out a fire. Please do not delay and mislead yourself!</p>
<p>(C) What Should Be Done When You Have Lung Disease</p>
<p>Prevent tuberculosis if you don't have it, treat tuberculosis if you have it. This is a matter of course. The same type of tuberculosis can differ in nature, severity, and the location of the lesion, so the treatment process will also be different, the treatment method, and the length of time required. This requires the doctor to combine X-ray films with other examination results to make a pathological assessment, and then choose the appropriate treatment method. Here, there are about two points to honestly tell the patient's family. (1) When choosing a doctor to treat the disease, you must take the right path and follow the right track. You must not take shortcuts and harbor a "let's try it" mentality, thinking that "injections and medication" can work. So far, there is no recognized effective medicine. Wasting money is a small matter, but missing the treatment period is a great pity. (2) Once a doctor is selected, you must faithfully follow the doctor's instructions and work together to ensure thorough treatment, so that you do not fall short of success.</p>
<p>(D) Several Things to Avoid</p>
<p>(1) Do not do strenuous breathing exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Do not do sunbathing treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Do not practice Tai Chi.</p>
<p>(4) Do not be confused by advertised medicines, and do not try other unscientific treatment methods.</p>

<h3>The Principle of Life</h3>
<p>— Ping Fan</p>
<p>Written by Chen Lifu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company in August of the 33rd year of the Republic, 307 pages in total, priced at five yuan.</p>
<p>The general public believes that Mr. Chen's contributions in practical political work are greater than his academic creations because he is a Chinese statesman. Currently, there are two different viewpoints for evaluating others in China: one belongs to the "practical" type as defined by Spranger, and the other belongs to the "theoretical" type. Practical people estimate the value of someone's work based on their actual contributions to national and social construction and do not understand academic contributions. In China, theoretical people often believe themselves to be above the practical world and consider themselves superior, so whether someone with a position in academia participates in practical work, or someone engaged in practical work seeks a theoretical foundation, these detached theorists either ignore their practical work or neglect their academic value. In fact, this attitude of dividing practical work and theory into two separate entities is a terrible phenomenon. We believe that someone engaged in practical work without a theoretical background is merely a mechanical craftsman, while those philosophers who confine themselves to ivory towers and are isolated from reality are nothing more than a form of high-level luxury. An ancient Chinese saying goes: "The highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, and the next is to establish words." The consistent style of Chinese scholarship has always been to seek the way of "inner sage and outer king." Scholarship, on the one hand, involves self-cultivation and self-restraint, and on the other hand, it lays a theoretical foundation for engaging in practical work to contribute to the nation and society. Leaving aside specialized academic research, solely from the perspective of scholarship, we admire Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Zhang Junmai more than pure rationalists and moralists (i.e., friends who purely discuss rationalism and moral principles). Regarding Mr. Chen's views, we believe he belongs to the former rather than the latter. Mr. Chen's theory of Vitalism and The Principle of Life, along with his academic spirit of accepting scientific experience based on Confucian traditions, is invaluable in the Chinese academic world. Whether he applies this theory as a background for his political life or pursues such a supreme principle in his political activities, it does not diminish his contribution to Chinese academic thought.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's "The Principle of Life" encompasses his entire philosophical system—from his ontology and cosmology to his views on life and society. Due to space limitations, this article cannot provide a comprehensive review. We can only provide a brief introduction and raise a few principled discussions. As for a review of the specialized philosophical content, we will have to leave it for another time.</p>
<p>The author's research starts from the reality of society. He states: "The current war has spread so widely, caused so much bloodshed, and demanded such great sacrifices that it can be called unprecedented... This compels every peace-loving and justice-loving person to exhaust their thoughts to find the root of the disaster and to further investigate whether there is a possibility in the depths of human nature to permanently eliminate the causes of war... The author firmly believes that comprehensive evolution is the security guarantee for human survival, and common survival is the central target of human evolution. Only when all human beings in the world can coexist and thrive can there be common and rapid evolution. As for local exclusive survival, it is merely an obstacle to comprehensive evolution and a threat to permanent peace. If there are factors of discord and inequality within a collective, the foundation of peace cannot be consolidated, and the disasters of war cannot be eliminated."</p>
<p>Now, we will outline several important principles in his system to give a glimpse of the whole.</p>
<p>(1) He accepts the "Principle of Change." All things in the universe are a continuous stream. From the beginning, he quotes several remarks by Confucius praising the I Ching: "How perfect is the I Ching! The continuous production is called change, and the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. Change is constant, circulating through the six voids."</p>
<p>(2) He does not recognize an unchanging substance outside of this flowing universe. Substance is the essence in this process of change, and its attribute is life, so the substance of the universe can be named "Life Element." It is neither mind nor matter in itself, but mind and matter are two aspects that it manifests. Mind is the dynamic force of the Life Element, and matter is the static force of the Life Element. Motion is development, and stillness is convergence. The creation of all cosmic flows occurs in the transition between motion and stillness.</p>
<p>(3) The substance of the universe is both one and many. The universe evolves and creates all things in the transition. In the evolution of the entire universe, it can be roughly divided into three stages: inorganic matter, living things, and human beings. Each stage of existence has its own characteristics and cannot be confused with one another. Therefore, the substance of the universe can be said to be diverse. However, these three stages are three levels of the same cosmic evolutionary process and are all manifestations of the Life Element. Therefore, the substance of the universe can also be said to be singular.</p>
<p>(4) The characteristics of human beings are: (A) self-awareness and reflection, the ability to consider the past and predict the future; (B) moral life, with virtues of benevolence, justice, tolerance, and respect; (C) artistic appreciation, with a surreal imagination, exploring unknown fields, and seeking ideals.</p>
<p>(5) Life should serve society, because in order to benefit oneself, one must benefit others. Benefiting others is how to magnify the meaning of one's own life. Further, one should strive to exhaust the nature of benevolence so that humans and the life of the universe become one. In human life, there lies a latent possibility for goodness. This possibility for goodness (which Mr. Chen calls "Sincerity") manifests as the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and then, through the eight steps of investigating things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world, one can exhaust one's own abilities to complete all things, seeking the completion of one's own personality and the completion of the personality of others.</p>
<p>(6) The evolution of social history is the pursuit of the highest realm of truth, goodness, and beauty of life under the dynamic of coexistence, mutual existence, and mutual evolution of all people. The evolution of human society can be divided into three stages: (A) competition between humans and non-humans; (B) competition between humans and humans; (C) competition between humans and nature. The ultimate goal is a world of great harmony.</p>
<p>(7) The Chinese historical culture can be said to be a consistent component of human cultural history. The qualities of Chinese culture are: (A) taking people's livelihood as the center and adhering to benevolence; (B) taking great harmony as the ultimate goal and basing it on supreme impartiality; (C) achieving moderation and harmony through diligence; (D) valuing propriety and righteousness and originating from utmost sincerity. These are also the highest realms of world culture. These qualities have not been fully developed and promoted in China. Therefore, our current responsibility is, on the one hand, to promote this cultural quality in China, and on the other hand, to seek its realization in the entire world. Only then can it be said that we are "establishing a heart for heaven and earth, establishing a life for the people, continuing the lost learning of the past sages, and creating peace for all generations."</p>
<p>The system of this book is clear and thoughtful, and the writing is crisp and lovely, especially in the remaining parts. It is well worth reading for young people. There are a few points I would like to discuss with the author in principle.</p>
<p>First, we feel that the author's establishment of this philosophical system starts from an ethical perspective. That is to say, he first has an ethical belief, and then establishes his system on this belief, similar to how modern Western philosophy, from Descartes to Kant Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, cannot escape the constraints of Christian faith in an invisible way. For example, the "Life" character used by the author is permeated with an ethical atmosphere, because this "Life" character penetrates to inorganic matter below and includes all human spiritual activities above in the author's mind. If we interpret it purely in the narrow sense of "Life," then inorganic matter is "lifeless" and spiritual activity is "super-life." For example, "Sincerity," which he says is the driving force of life, has a metaphysical meaning. Sincerity exists in the universe, in everyone, and in all things. This applies the "Sincerity" character, which is limited to human activities and has moral significance, to all things in the universe, which have no moral phenomena.</p>
<p>Second, the author's research method is less empirical and more intuitive, which is also because the author's starting point of research is ethical. The author's power of thought is very rich. His main idea comes from his personal experience and insights, rather than starting from analyzing current empirical facts (such as C.D. Broad in England and C. Lewis in the United States), nor from a purely intellectual standpoint of logical analysis (such as Feng Zhisheng in our country and McTaggart in England). The reviewer personally prefers the empirical analysis method.</p>
<p>Third, when the book discusses the view of social evolution history, it rarely applies the materials of current Western sociology and social philosophy. We believe that there is a lot of information in it that can support the author's theory. The author lists a brief table of each stage of human evolution on page 266 of this book, and specifically mentions the progress of survival methods and the evolution of political systems. We feel that the author can further develop this aspect to complete his social philosophy and political philosophy.</p>
<h3>Tales of the Struggles of Scientists</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hao</p>
<p>Written by Grove Wilson, translated by Zeng Shi Shi, published by Life Bookstore</p>
<p>It is scientists throughout history who have brought us into this almost legendary world. Today, all unimaginable natural forces have been tamed and utilized by them, and all incredible laws and theorems have been discovered and explained by them. Scientists have not only created a brand new world for us, but have also completely changed our way of life, making human life shift from hardship to comfort, from passive to active, and from slaves of nature to masters of nature. Scientists have created and liberated mankind.</p>
<p>However, no scientific discovery or invention is entirely accidental. That is to say, no scientist's success comes without an endless process of struggle - whether it is a struggle against oneself or against the outside world. The unparalleled fighting spirit of scientists has opened up a smooth path for us descendants, allowing us to enjoy more comfortably. In order to admire the unyielding fighting spirit of scientists throughout history, and, more importantly, in order to provide encouragement and reference for all future scientists, there is no doubt that the publication of the book "Tales of the Struggles of Scientists" has its great and glorious value.</p>
<p>"Tales of the Struggles of Scientists" is a biographical text written in extremely clear and beautiful language. Because it is narrated with each scientist as the center, it is more interesting than any other science book. And because it is narrated in chronological order, it can also be regarded as a history of Western science development. Therefore, more precisely, this is not only a biography of many famous scientists, but also an interesting history of Western science.</p>
<p>The major scientists mentioned in this book mainly include twenty-eight, from Thales, the first scientist in history since there has been a history, to Einstein, who is still alive today. There are mathematicians, zoologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, astronomers… including all natural scientists, but there is a unique characteristic in them, that is: the indomitable spirit of fighting for truth. If I am a real scientific worker, I think there are few people who can remain unmoved by such a great spiritual inspiration.</p>
<p>The content of the book is extremely popular and the narrative is extremely persuasive. Although it is a book of about five hundred pages, I finished reading it in one breath without even realizing it. It is indeed very suitable as a science textbook or extracurricular reading material for middle school students.</p>
<p>Those who aspire to science, go here to learn, for the sake of mankind.</p>
<h3>On Talk Fengzi's Edited *The Human World*</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>In today's dwindling and precarious publishing industry as a whole, it is truly difficult to maintain a literary publication unless its own content has significant weight.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of a wide readership, The Human World monthly, which does not have strong financial backing, has been able to stand tall under this storm-like economic pressure. Therefore, it can be seen that even at a time when the purchasing power of readers has generally declined, the need for a good reading material is not much different from that of pancakes and fried dough sticks.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy both the tastes of readers and the standards of the publication itself, we see many painstaking efforts on the part of the editor: among several literary works that carry a significant amount of weight, one can find many lighter, lively sketches and essays, allowing readers to slightly relieve the heavy feelings in their hearts; the flexible arrangement and rich illustrations dilute the overly strong literary atmosphere, and in addition to a few woodcuts and comics, the title flowers by Mr. Ding Cong and Mr. Liang Chen add to the liveliness of the entire content form.</p>
<p>From the first issue to the most recent issue (the fifth issue), there is not much difference in form, but there are obvious slight advances and retreats in content. For example, the proportion of novels and poems has decreased almost every issue (from 40% to 20%), while prose, essays, and the like have increased instead. This can also be said to be a clever point on the part of the editor. Among the few literary publications currently available, most of the content focuses on novels and poems, so in the limited space of this small publication, it is easier to please by focusing on short essays and notes rather than working hard on large-scale creative novels, because this is ultimately a "comprehensive" literary publication.</p>
<p>In addition to travel notes and biographies, this publication has another feature—several articles on art—which can be said to be rare and precious in general literary publications today, such as Li Jia's Immortal Statues, Starkovich's Depression, Liu Kaiqu's Soviet Sculpture, Xu Chi's Music in School, etc., which are all quite valuable and content-rich.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is also to cater to the tastes of readers, The Human World still cannot get rid of the star system's method of selecting manuscripts—but occasionally one or two unfamiliar names appear, especially in the last two issues, and this problem has improved a lot.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I hope that this publication can continue to be published, and that it will become stronger and more complete!</p>
<h3>History of Qin and Han Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Gong Peixuan</p>
<p>(Written by Lao Zhenyi, published by China Culture Service Society)</p>
<p>This is a small book listed in the Youth Library, so its writing is simple and its narrative is straightforward. The author's intention seems to be to depict the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties in an accessible style. We can glimpse this effort. However, with the long years of the Qin and Han dynasties and the vast and complex events, trying to describe them in detail with a mere 50,000 words will inevitably feel rough. However, it is indeed a benevolent act worthy of being introduced to readers, as a supplementary reading material for middle school students or as a self-study textbook for out-of-school youth.</p>
<p>We say that this book is worth introducing to readers for the following two reasons: (1) This book describes the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties in simple language. In terms of narration, it gives people a fresh understanding, and it is easier to read than large-scale works. (2) The arguments are quite correct and the measurement is quite steady, which shows the author's own achievements in the study of Chinese history. Therefore, this book will not mislead readers to a distorted understanding of Chinese history, which is the basic requirement of historical writing.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, each book has its own way of writing, and each author has his own viewpoints and opinions. It only depends on the target audience. Based on the essential point of seeking precision, this book is obviously not up to standard. However, it does have a good point, that is, it can tell you a general concept when you pull everything together. For individual situations, the reader can find it in this entire concept. The book begins with a description of the rise of Qin, which seems too hasty. However, this book is not a study of textual research, so it should be forgiven in this regard. However, when the author begins to describe the rise of Qin, he should at least clearly explain the environment of Qin in the late Warring States period, which does not seem to be an excessive demand from readers.</p>
<p>The focus of this book can be seen from its table of contents, which consists of ten chapters, that is, first describe the rise and fall of Qin, then the Chu-Han contention, then the disintegration of Han, and finally "Academic Beliefs and Material Life of the Two Han Dynasties". The chapter on the rise and fall of Qin begins with a narrative. In terms of the weight of the whole book, Qin and Han should be equal, but looking at the whole book, this chapter on the rise and fall of Qin seems to be a preface to writing the history of Han. The chapter on the Chu-Han contention mentions the Hongmen Banquet, and the author messed up the relationship between Xiang Bo and Xiang Yu. The original text says: "Liu Bang knew that he was no match for them, so he personally went to Xiang Yu's camp to explain, and Zhang Liang, a close friend of Xiang Yu's elder brother Xiang Bo, asked Xiang Yu to intercede." It also said: "At that time, Fan Zeng persuaded Xiang Yu to kill Liu Bang on the spot, but Xiang Yu hesitated after listening to the advice of his elder brother Xiang Bo..." Thus, Xiang Bo was regarded as being in the same generation as Xiang Yu. The original relationship of uncle and nephew was turned into brothers. It is recorded that Xiang Bo was Xiang Yu's younger uncle, and both the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han are consistent in this regard. The Book of Han was written later and based on Sima Qian's Records, so there is no doubt about it. It can be seen that Xiang Bo was definitely not in the same generation as Xiang Yu. This book calls Xiang Bo Yu's elder brother. I don't know where it comes from? As far as I know, Wang Fuzhi's comments in his Interpretation of Zizhi Tongjian's chapter on Emperor Gao of Han had an impression of Xiang Bo and Xiang Yu as brothers. The original text is: "...(referring to Xiang Yu) trembling with fear, with spears and halberds in his dreams, how could he not deeply suspect the world? However, his suspicion was of no help. Xiang Bo was in the heart of the King of Han; he was his brother..." Perhaps this is the basis for calling Yu Bo brothers. Looking at the tone of Mr. Wang Fuzhi's article, this is just to condemn Xiang Yu for "looking left and right, only at his brothers and in-laws," and it is by no means to list them as brothers in the same generation. It is hoped that the author will correct this when reprinting.</p>
<p>In addition, the reasons for Liu Bang's success should also be analyzed in detail, and this book has not fulfilled its responsibility, which is also one of the regrets of this book.</p>
<h3>The Destruction of Happiness</h3>
<p>— Ruo Fei</p>
<p>Reading A. Gide's "Bathsheba"</p>
<p>André Gide's "Bathsheba," one of the essays in the translated "Prodigal Son Returns," is a short piece that I deeply admire. It resembles poetry, yet its conception is more profound; it resembles drama, yet, apart from King David's monologue, it lacks other elements of dramatic composition; it resembles prose, yet its form is poetic, its essence poetic, and certain short verses possess more poetic quality than many others' poems.</p>
<p>Using such peculiar form and expression, Gide vividly and dramatically portrays a human tragedy. This is Gide's artistic achievement, far surpassing the likes of Baudelaire, who merely express simple conceptions through prose poetry. We can say that Gide's prose poetry has clearly entered a new realm.</p>
<p>Bathsheba, a woman's name, initially symbolizes the happiness that slaves seize from solitude. Subsequently, a master possessing greater happiness, resorts to base means to take her over. Bathsheba becomes a victim between the slave and the tyrant.</p>
<p>Here, Gide not only depicts the perverted psychology of King David of Judah, but, more importantly, he treats the King of Judah as a typical tyrant, writing him in a very vivid and refined manner. In a short prose poem, he narrates how a wealthy man disregards his own wealth, obsessively coveting the property and happiness of others, and then destroying it. The depiction of this psychological process is worth an entire novel.</p>
<p>When King David fervently praises Uriah the Hittite's bravery and loyalty, he says:</p>
<p>"In the cave of Adullam, I sought in vain for cool refreshment;</p>
<p>The Philistines were encamped in the valley;</p>
<p>Bethlehem was already occupied by them.</p>
<p>You know there is a well of bitter water in Bethlehem;</p>
<p>That day I longed for the water of the village well;</p>
<p>I wanted to drink from it to be satisfied...</p>
<p>Who then broke through the enemy ranks?</p>
<p>Who risked their lives to bring me a cup of tea!</p>
<p>Who was it? Tell me.</p>
<p>It was Uriah the Hittite."</p>
<p>Although deeply aware of the value of a slave's loyalty, once he becomes infatuated with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, the slave's bravery and loyalty cannot save him from his own doom. As King David said:</p>
<p>"My hands were already full of happiness and wealth,</p>
<p>So that I could not hold any more,</p>
<p>But that little happiness over there,</p>
<p>I was willing to throw away all the rest for it...</p>
<p>It comes from such solitude, this happiness."</p>
<p>All desires stem from this psychological change. A self-centered person is never content. When he tires of his own great happiness, he covets the small happiness of others. As far as Bathsheba is concerned, she is just a small woman, yet in King David's eyes, her charm while bathing in the small courtyard is more beautiful than any other beauty. "I almost suspect that it is her that I want, or perhaps that circle... and that wine, the wine I drank, from his little vineyard!" This is the true face of desire. Did King David really fall in love with Bathsheba? No, he was just bored and wanted to find a way out for his idleness. He loved not Bathsheba herself, but "the shadow attached to her little country"—that small happiness. Outside his own great happiness, he does not allow others to have any happiness, no matter how brave and sincere that person is.</p>
<p>King David finally possesses Bathsheba and says:</p>
<p>"Because the trace of a ship on the sea,</p>
<p>The trace of a man on a woman's deep body,</p>
<p>Even God cannot recognize."</p>
<p>In fact, there is something even more tragic. Uriah the Hittite is fighting in the front lines for King David to attack Rabbah, and in the rear, his wife has become King David's plaything. In order to permanently possess the warrior's wife, King David ordered to the Hittite: "Uriah is the bravest of the three armies, he should be placed on the front line;" while ordering Marshal Joab that when the Hittite approached the city wall, the entire army should suddenly retreat, leaving only Uriah the Hittite alone...</p>
<p>King David effortlessly took the small happiness from his subordinates, and because it was too effortless, he no longer cherished this small happiness. When Bathsheba, dressed in mourning clothes, came to see King David in the dark night, what did the latter say?...</p>
<p>"Go away! Take her back! I have told you that I do not want to see her again... I hate her!"</p>
<p>This is the end. The abominable nature of the tyrant, is deeply exposed by just these few sentences depicting psychological abnormality.</p>

<h3>Should High Schools Implement Subject Specialization?</h3>
<p>Reasons for Subject Specialization</p>
<p>(1) Last year, I graduated from Youyuan High School in Suzhou, where the high school department had once implemented subject specialization. Based on my experience with both subject specialization and non-specialization systems, and my experiences after entering university, I have the following opinions on subject specialization in high school:</p>
<p>I advocate for subject specialization, but specialization should not be overly granular. It is sufficient to separate into arts/business and science/engineering streams. The reason is that this division makes the divergence for university entrance clear and the scope is broader. Those pursuing science/engineering and those pursuing arts/business should be clearly separated. Within each stream, they can specialize in many departments in the future. For example, the science/engineering stream includes science, engineering, medicine, agriculture, etc., while the arts/business stream includes arts, law, business, etc.</p>
<p>After specialization, students can make deeper and further progress in one direction. In terms of application, it can achieve significant results, and in terms of personal interest, it can be focused. I always believe that high school should provide a considerable foundation in some subjects, but this is not always the case. Therefore, subject specialization is a way to achieve this goal. If one chooses to enter the workforce after graduating from high school, as long as they choose a career close to what they have learned, their abilities will definitely be much stronger.</p>
<p>I am studying engineering, and I feel that subjects like "Descriptive Geometry" and "Engineering Drawing" in the "freshman" year can be learned in the science/engineering stream after high school specialization.</p>
<p>Some people say that high school specialization may prevent students from accurately choosing the subject they want to study. But if we think carefully, how many people who apply to university actually "apply" to what they "want" to?</p>
<p>— Huang Qinglin, this city</p>
<p>(2) The current elementary normal schools and vocational schools are disguised forms of high school subject specialization. Therefore, I advocate that high schools must implement subject specialization, because "a person's talent is developed through specialization and destroyed through generalization."</p>
<p>— Wang Qian'de, this city</p>
<p>(3) Subject specialization should not be implemented in the first year of high school, but it must be implemented from the second year onwards.</p>
<p>Because the current first-year high school curriculum, whether it is mathematics or biology, is a common subject that should be studied. The first year can be used by students themselves and teachers to conduct a more thorough study of their interests and abilities, and to determine which subject to enter in the second year.</p>
<p>The current shortcomings of the second and third-year general courses in high school are that those preparing to enter the university's science and engineering departments feel that mathematics and physics are insufficient, which makes high school seniors feel difficult to apply to universities.</p>
<p>Those who are preparing to enter the university's arts, law, business, and medical departments feel that there are too many mathematics and physics courses studied in the current second and third grades of high school, and they feel that there are not enough courses for their own needs. Therefore, I think that specialization should start from the second year of high school.</p>
<p>— Guan Xianwu, Nantong</p>
<p>(4) What China currently needs is practical, effective, and targeted education that meets the needs of national construction. If so many years are spent on studying superficial and impractical theories, then it is unnecessary. Therefore, for the sake of the future, it is urgent to change this school system to break through the difficulty of seeking knowledge and to meet practical needs.</p>
<p>— You Cheng, this city</p>
<p>(5) In our country, which lacks talent, we can enable every young person to have a skill, so that they will not be threatened by unemployment as soon as they enter society, and we can also avoid the suffering of a lack of specialized talent everywhere. This is not only the luck of tens of millions of young people across the country, but also the luck of the country and society. But most young people are unable to enter university. Can we not give them some practical skills and watch them become unemployed?</p>
<p>— Tan Dezhen, this city</p>
<p>(6) It may be better to change the junior high school to a four-year system, and the senior high school specialization to also be four years. Then, the high school graduates after eight years will not create "talents" who are neither literary nor military.</p>
<p>— Rong Xicun, Ningbo</p>
<p>(7) Students hope to specialize, and the attitude of the school authorities is almost the same, but they hope to make it more specific.</p>
<p>Subject specialization in high school has long been an established practice in some places, such as in some schools in Hunan. The method is to choose one of arts or science from the second grade onwards. However, before the education system changes, for example, even if high schools specialize, and entering university still requires taking science subjects, what is the use of this?</p>
<p>I hope that the education system of the authorities can be coordinated with reality.</p>
<p>— Zhang Diou, Nanjing</p>
<p>(8) Today's high school has completely become an institution for taking university entrance examinations. Apart from the greatest purpose of taking university entrance examinations, it seems that it has no other purpose in itself. Because you have to take integral calculus, algebra, and geometry to enter university, you study integral calculus, algebra, and geometry; because you have to take social studies, economics, physics, and chemistry to enter university, you study social studies, economics, physics, and chemistry. He did not take into account whether these are in line with the needs of students? Is it helpful to the profession? This has created the tragedy of today's learning is not used.</p>

<p>(9) If I specialized in high school, if I wanted to study medicine, I would focus on the literary aspects, such as Chinese language and literature, chemistry, and biology. I can reduce a lot of unnecessary troubles in mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>A person who studies medicine feels that high school needs to specialize. I think people who study engineering, science, or law must have the same feeling.</p>
<p>— Wei Zandao, this city</p>
<p>(10) Judging from the general economic situation of Chinese society at present, how many out of ten high school graduates can continue their studies for further education? Therefore, I agree that the current secondary school education system should be supplemented by a subject specialization system.</p>
<p>— Liu Yijin of Dashi, high reward for flood relief</p>
<p>(11) The specialization of agricultural science is most needed. Farmers account for the majority of our country's population. After graduating from ordinary high schools, farmers' children will no longer engage in rural service improvement. Because what they have learned is not what they use, the level of rural education cannot be improved today, and the agricultural science is declining. Therefore, high school specialization is extremely suitable in middle schools in rural towns.</p>
<p>— Lu Zhixin, Nanjing</p>
<p>(12) I absolutely hope that high schools will specialize, and adopt a subject selection system, which is indeed a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>— Jin Guan, this city</p>
<p>(13) In a nutshell, many malpractices, speeding, and truancy can all be said to be the result of the current unreasonable high school curriculum. If a subject specialization system can be implemented, allowing them to each have their own place and learn in peace, their grades will naturally be satisfactory.</p>
<p>— Zheng Hongji, this city</p>
<p>(14) As for the method of specialization, we advocate that we still use the past method of "arts" and "science" subjects. This is the case in European countries such as Germany and France. As for the multi-subject secondary schools (including vocational or normal subjects of various subjects) in the American or Soviet style, it is not the normal senior high school, and we do not advocate adoption.</p>
<p>— Xu Jijing, Changzhou</p>
<p>Reasons for Opposing Subject Specialization</p>
<p>A I am studying natural sciences, and I am now working in a factory. I dare not agree with subject specialization in high school. My opinion is:</p>
<p>(1) High school subject specialization is prone to causing "learning is not suitable" - a person's interests; it is not possible to determine within a short period of time. Many students are still hesitant when preparing to enter university after graduating from high school, and do not know which subject to choose? Even students studying in university often find that the subjects they have chosen do not match their interests. If a junior high school graduate is asked to study a specialized subject, there will be no satisfactory results; random choices are enough to cause future regrets, which is a waste of time.</p>
<p>(2) High school specialization has the disadvantage of "caring about this and losing that" - If it is said that high school specialization is because four years of university is not specialized enough, or because people who study business and literature say that geometry and trigonometry are not useful, then I say that specialization should be implemented in elementary school, or there is no need to go to school, go to factories as workers, and go to stores as apprentices, that is truly learning what is useful and very specialized. But this is the method of training craftsmen. Good scientists and industrialists are not made this way. They should have knowledge of all aspects, and have sufficient knowledge of natural sciences, social sciences, and business sciences, so that specialized training should be discussed after the foundation of general knowledge is laid. Without a good foundation, specialization is "craftsman".</p>
<p>— Ming, this city</p>
<p>B Secondary schools already have specialized schools, which can be seen everywhere. Students can apply for advanced or transfer schools as their interests dictate. In general, the test questions for university majors belong to general subjects. Obviously, it is not suitable for high school majors. They must be grouped for the exam, and it is difficult for most to follow. Moreover, the teaching process of university majors goes from shallow to deep. High school majors inevitably have a sense of repetition, and it is necessary to study at the same time as those who have entered general subjects. There will inevitably be familiarity, unfamiliarity, and speed. There are many disadvantages in teaching. If students cannot enter the university majors due to their financial resources, they must learn specialized knowledge and skills early in order to learn and be useful. It is also not in line with the trend. Try to watch the daily newspapers, the companies, commercial agencies, institutions, and groups published on the newspaper, which are very restricted. Specialized talents are limited to universities or university majors and above. Therefore, high school specialization, the academic qualifications of scholars, from the perspective of the general society, still feels that the creation is insufficient.</p>

<p>(Editor's Note: Those who oppose specialization also include Mr. Chen Kaijia of Jiangdu, Mr. Xu Nanrong of this city, Wanshi, Zhongkai, Zhao, and Ning Zhenrui, seven gentlemen. Because their opinions are roughly the same, they are omitted.)</p>
<h3>Coordinate with the Needs of National Construction and Strengthen Professional Training</h3>
<p>— Xu Dongqi</p>
<p>—Subject Training is Essential</p>
<p>To meet the needs of national construction, we must strengthen professional training, because semi-proficient "generalists" can hardly achieve the goal of applying what they have learned. What is urgently needed today is: to cultivate a large number of mid-level talents to engage in the country's revitalization and construction; and to cultivate their skills to live independently, so subject training has become essential.</p>
<p>From a moral point of view, the advantage of specialization lies in economy and expertise, as well as reducing the risk of unemployment. Finally, it can promote the completion of the great cause of national construction. However, its shortcoming is that it is biased towards various subjects and various departments, and it is not easy to obtain a general understanding. In addition, there seem to be no other shortcomings. However, this alone cannot be considered a reason why specialization should not be implemented, right?</p>
<p>The method of selecting courses in secondary schools has been tried out for a long time. From the second academic year of high school, students are divided into Group A and Group B. There are required courses and elective courses; the teaching hours of each subject vary depending on the group. What we are proposing now "Subject Training", is only a further step in the method of selecting courses; it is closer to "professionalization" and is a preparation for the division of labor and cooperation in society. (Dang Shu)</p>
<h3>I Propose a Compromise Solution: Add Courses to High School and Allow Elective Courses</h3>
<p>— Dan Meng</p>
<p>The shortcoming of the current three-three system of secondary schools lies in the fact that students with different personalities are given a uniform educational system and are given injected objective education, which fails to follow the development of each person's specialization and interests. Although vocational education, such as industrial schools and commercial schools, is bound by tradition and has little effect.</p>
<p>If secondary schools adopt a subject specialization system, the drawbacks will easily cause students to fall into an unsound foundation. To avoid this foresight, adding courses and allowing elective courses will be a worthwhile strategy to consider.</p>
<p>It is probably inevitable that the three-three system will be reformed into a six-year system. In this way, the waste of adding shelves on the bed can be avoided. Under the unified plan of the six-year system, the implementation of adding and selecting courses is not only possible, but also necessary. In addition to English, Chinese, and civics, which are required courses, the teaching methods of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and history and geography should be unified, and there is no need to teach them twice in junior high school and high school. Elementary physics and chemistry, elementary history and geography, arithmetic, algebra, and plane geometry can be forced to be read; high school physics and chemistry, history and geography, solid geometry, and analytic geometry can be listed as elective courses. Moreover, the purpose of setting up these courses was originally to facilitate entrance to a certain department of the university, and it is completely useless to students who do not wish to choose a certain college, so it should be abolished.</p>
<p>What courses should be added? The general principle is to combine the basic specialized courses, which generally have to be repeated in the first year of university, into the later stages of secondary school. Then it will have advanced physics and chemistry, advanced history and geography, and other mathematics. In addition, the extra time can be used to add other elective courses, such as general theory of law, political science, bookkeeping, journalism, economics, commercial overview, selected poems, selected texts, literary writing, mechanics, electricity, outline of machinery, general outline of medicine, overview of agriculture, and a greater number of homework, which students can choose to read by themselves. Fortunately, their interests lie in their career will be determined afterwards. And when they find that they are incompatible, it is easy to switch. It is also stipulated that each student must choose several kinds, then they can actively find their own way out.</p>
<p>Although this cannot create specialized talents, but only sow seeds, but even if secondary school specializes, the talents who study it are also generally poor. Then it is better to adopt this method, which can be much more flexible and allow each young person to have the opportunity to search for their own interests. (Suzhou)</p>
<h3>Introducing a High School with Subject Specialization</h3>
<p>— Yi Ding</p>
<p>Whether high schools should specialize has become a focus of discussion. In the end, which is better or worse, each has its own views. I will now introduce a high school with subject specialization and introduce its general situation as follows, which I think can be used as a reference for the education community:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School was founded in the 16th year of the Republic of China. It was initially divided into normal, ordinary, and commercial subjects. Later, it was changed to science, engineering, and commerce subjects until today.</p>
<p>Science is roughly similar to ordinary subjects, but mathematics and physics are more important, while history and geography are listed as non-major subjects. Teaching focuses on experiments. Physics, chemistry, and biology all have laboratories, where students experiment in groups. Currently, due to time and teaching progress, Science One experiments on biology, Science Two experiments on chemistry, and Science Three experiments on physics, with two or three students in a group for experiments. Science focuses on further education, and because the level of mathematics and physics is higher, those who are admitted to the National University's School of Science and Engineering account for an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Commerce and Engineering can be listed as vocational subjects, but some also continue their studies. I will now give a brief introduction to the Commerce and Engineering subjects:</p>
<p>The first grade of commerce has bookkeeping, typing and other subjects and related business common sense aspects. The second grade will further study commercial geography, commercial theory, cooperative studies, management, and there is a consumer cooperative for experimentation. Commerce Three's experimental management is "Shangzhong Bank", and it studies statistics, accounting, and national trade. In addition to interning at Shangzhong Bank, Commerce Three students can also intern at foreign firms or banks.</p>
<p>The engineering curriculum is relatively heavy. In the first and second grades, algebra, geometry, analytic geometry, and trigonometry are studied completely, and engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and drawing are added. Intern at Shangzhong Factory. The third grade adds courses such as mechanical principles, automotive science, and aircraft science, and the internship is also heavy. Therefore, engineering students have as many as eight hours of classes every day, and in addition, they have to do homework and practice, which makes them feel unable to handle it. This point is also a shortcoming of engineering. The signer believes that it is really necessary to appropriately extend the length of study.</p>
<p>The above is a simple introduction to the science, engineering, and commerce subjects of "Shangzhong". If you scholars want to make a more detailed study, you can consult the following two gentlemen: Principal Dr. Shen Yizhen and Director of Academic Affairs Mr. Lu Keyi.</p>
