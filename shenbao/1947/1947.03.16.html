<h3>蔣總裁訓詞</h3>
<p>三中全會開幕，蔣總裁訓詞要點：（一）二中全會召開國民大會。結束訓政。還政於民之決議，業已貫澈，値得安慰。（二）和平建設，已因中共之蓄意叛亂而吿頓挫，至為痛心。（三）本屆全會，對於行憲準備時期，本黨地位與職責，應有詳盡之檢討和明確之決議。（四）希望各同志體認環境，反省自身，痛切檢討，力求改革，完成本黨歷史使命。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣總裁今在三中全會開幕典禮中致詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>各位同志：今天本黨舉行第六屆中央第三次全體會議，距離二中全會閉會的日子，恰恰是一年了。各位同志齊集首都，檢討過去的成績，交換工作的經騐，分析當前的局勢，來確立我們木黨今後努力的方針。對於我們革命建國任務的推進，一定有很大的貢獻。本屆與許多同志，闊別一年，重新聚首，尤其感覺快慰，</p>
<p>還政於民任務達成</p>
<p>二中全會所留給我們最大的任務，是要召集國民大會，頒佈憲法，實行憲政，以貫澈我們結束訓政，還政於民的夙願。道一個任務，經過了千　百折，由於國內各黨派和社會賢達一致協力，以及本黨同志的精誠合作，終於完滿達成。自去年年底憲法頒布以後，政府正在依照國民大會的決議，着手於實施憲政準備程序的推進。同時依照政治協商會議的成案，擴大我們國民政府的　礎。截至現在為止，立怯院，監察院，已經由各黨派人士共同參加了，在最短期間，國民政府委員會及行政院，也就要改組完成這樣羣策盡力的來共同努力推進民主。一定能够貫澈國父的遺敎，完成建國的程序，以安慰五十年來的革命先烈和抗戰犧牲的軍民。這是首先要向大會報吿的。</p>
<p>關於和平建設的進行，說起來最足痛心。二中全會宣言，曾經痛切指出軍隊國家化，為和平統一的基礎，必須國家有名實相符的統一，纔可以眞正實現民主，纔可以進行經濟建設。因之確認我們國內不應該再有武裝叛亂的變故，各地方不應該再有秩序紊亂的現象。二中全會宣言，幷指出安定秩序，和解除民困為當前迫切的需要，而恢復交通，尤其是復興經濟，必須做到首要的急務。所以二中全會宜言，堅決要求中共部隊停止繼續攻襲和妨礙。統一的行動，國民政府對於國內政治紛爭的處理，就是根據這一個要旨而行。政府深深體察全國人民刦後餘生的痛苦，以及戰後社會瘡痍滿目的不堪再受　殘，所以對於中共武裝割據妨礙統一，殘害人民的軍事行動，不惜再三忍讓，以求用政治方法和調處途徑來解決。去年一年之間，政府頒布了三次停止衝突的命令，更在友邦美國的調處之下，進行了無數次的談商，但是中共始終迷信武力，背信棄義，政府遵照整軍方案，實行縮軍，而中共不斷的擴軍，政府每頒發一次停止衝突令，中共部隊即乘機繼續擴大其侵佔。最後又拒絕參加國民大會，否認國民大會所通過的憲法。對於政府派員商談和平的提議，也已遭其斷然拒絕。</p>
<p>中共叛亂建設困難</p>
<p>最近三個月來的演變，證明了政治解決的途徑，已經絕望，而中共全面叛亂，阻礙統一的軍事行動，這一個月來在東北則兩次進攻長春，在山東則不斷進攻靑島與濟南。最近數日，又在晋西陜北發動兇猛的攻勢。如此叛亂形勢，一天天的擴大，全國同胞要求安定，中共偏不許有一刻安寗。全國同胞呼籲和平，中共一定要擴大動亂。政府為捍衛國家統一，保障人民安全，當然不能坐視變亂而不加制止，但是國家元氣，受盡摧殘，復員工作，備遭阻礙，人民所受的浩刦，火熱水深，經濟建設的進行，更是困難。這眞是國家最大的不幸！</p>
<p>我要明吿我們同志的，中國五十年來國民革命的經過，本來是困難重重的，然而每經一次困難，就加多一次磨練，就更增一次光明。從北洋軍閥，以至日本帝國主義者，以至今天的中共，都是我們國家復與期中所遭遇的阻力，也是我們所必須克服的困難。我們祗要順應着全闔人民的祈向，循着救國建國的常道，集合全國愛國有志之士，來共同奮鬥，就沒有不能成功的這理。所以我們今天量要的急務，還是盡其在我。我們要鞏固國家的統一，摧毀妨碍國家建設的阻力，同時我們決不因此而改變我們實行民主實行建設的方針，或　懈我們實施憲政與復興經濟的努力。我們國家今天的要求，是國家統一與政治民主，我們在抗戰勝利以後，最大的任務，是民權主義和民生主義的實行，祗要我們堅貞奮鬥，努力不懈，我們敢斷言，決沒有任何力量能阻止我們建國工作的完成。</p>
<p>應與各黨共同努力</p>
<p>我們這一次全會所要討論的主題，當然很多，常會所擬提出的提案，有關於憲政的，有關於一般政治的，有關於經濟喲，有關於黨務的，我個人認為本屆全會，對於行憲準備時期，本黨的地位和職責，應該特別有一個詳盡的檢討和明確的決議。我們面臨實施憲政的前夕，距離行憲的時間不過九個月，我們這一次全會，實在是結束訓政的一次全會。我們自北伐完成以後，因爲國家多故，這二十年的期間，不得不以當仁不讓的精神，以一黨來負起國家的重任，但是我們實在沒有一夭怠忽我們實行憲政的準備。我們在抗戰期間，邀集各黨派和社會賢達，共同參加抗煩建國的工作，參政會的成立，已經奠立了民主政治的基礎。現在憲法旣經頒布，在建國程序上，我們就要進入憲政時期。在政治情形上，就要由一黨負責的時期，過渡成各黨派負全民共同負責的時期。今後要將國家的責任，公之於全國各黨派和全體人民，所以這一次全會，實在是二十年來空前重要的一次集會。我們要從這次全會起，從新　定黨和政府的關係，改變我們黨員在訓政時期的意識和觀念，在已往是黨的政策，由黨透過政府來執行。在今後我們所有對於國家軍事政治經濟一切的決議，就要以建議的方式，送達政府，並且協助政府來執行。我們在下屆國民大會開會以前，雖然還不能完全解除，我們對於國家的責任，可是我們要立即準備自居於普通的政黨，要和派處於平等的地位，盡同樣的義務，享同樣的權利，並且要與各政黨相互提挈相互勉勵，以促進國家建設的成功。這一點意義是已往任何一次全會所沒有的。我所以要特別提示於各位同志，希望精心研討，作成決議，使各級黨部和全體同志，一致有所　循。</p>
<p>檢討自己力求改進</p>
<p>其次我們這次全會，應該以大部份的時間和精力，集中檢討我們本黨的自身。我們的黨有悠久的歷史，有豐　的基礎，可是這廿年以素質，應該怎樣提高，黨部的業務和作風，應該怎樣改進，黨和民衆的關係以及黨爲民衆服務的精神，應該怎樣加以檢討和改善，黨的歷史，應該如何發揚，黨員的敎育和自我批評的風氣，應該如何切實促進，惟其我們是國內第一大黨，也唯其我們是爲國負責最長久的黨，所以我們黨內無容　言的，有不少缺點的存在，更有不少惰性的存在。我們應該怎麼樣改正這些缺點和革除這些惰性。尤其我們在這個國家多故而革命環境險惡的今天，我們應該怎麼樣加強自信和互信，我們在這憲政行將實施的前夕，應該怎樣培養我們黨員恢宏的氣度，和其他黨派精誠相處。諸如此類的問題，都需要全會同志虛心靜氣，加以硏討，集思廣益，作成決議。要知道本黨為救國建國而存在，唯有改進本黨，　能充實本黨，唯有充實本黨，　能使本黨担負起對於國家的責任。　各位同志，我們總理常說：「舉國之內，一物不得其所，就是我們革命的責任未盡。」這實在是一段極寳貴的遺訓。現在抗戰勝利已將二年，但是復員未竣，建設多阻、民生困苦，社會杌隉，經濟動盪，人心散漫，我們國家的獨立平等，還沒有得到確實的保障，這些都是我們全黨同志的恥辱，也就是我們對於全國同胞對於革命先烈對於抗戰犧牲軍民應負的責任。希望各位同志體認環境，反省自身，乘這全會的期間，痛切檢討，力求改革，允其要淬勵全黨同志親愛精誠，負責盡職，無愧為總理的信徒，克盡保持抗戰光榮，促進建國成功的時代使命。</p>

<h3>全會花絮</h3>
<p>主席團宋落選</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕全會預備會議選舉主席團時，首由總裁就執委名單中提出加倍候選人，所提廿二名候選人名額中，宋子文亦爲其中之一，票選結果，宋氏共獲九票，居第廿二名，為落選人物中之最末一名，現宋仍在杭州遊春，未來京出席。票選時，投票人共一八三人，以孫科得票最多，于右任次之，陳果夫第三，李文範列十二名，為第一落選者。此外，程潛·潘公展·張道藩·段錫朋·梁寒操·賀衷寒·麥斯武德·張厲生及朱　靑等，亦均在主席團候選人名單之列。</p>
<p>記者無法入塲</p>
<p>此次全會開會期間，關於新聞報道一事，決定由中央社廣播全國，今日大會舉行會議時，旁聽席上之記者，為數寥寥，此與去冬在今日同一會塲（國民大會堂）召開國民大會時之百餘記者羣擠於旁聽席上之空前熱鬧情况，恰成為一反比寫照，而全會採取不歡迎各報社記者入塲採訪，亦將為歷屆全會以來前所未有之首次現象。今日各報社記者祗能在會外活躍，雖各　才智，力事探詢，所得至微，大會設有新聞發布組，歸中宣部人員主持，分上下午「配給」新聞，故門庭頗為冷落。黨報如中央日報（公報性質）等，亦曾請求派遣記者進入會塲，但現已放棄此項計劃矣。</p>
<p>中委不敢乘機</p>
<p>大會今晨開幕禮時，到中央委員共計二五三人，其中執行變員一三六人，候補執行委員四十七人，中央監察委員五十人，候補監察委員廿人，較以上數屆到會人數爲少。按中委共計四六〇人，此次來京出席者較少，原因一爲各地交通阻隔，三爲鑒於最近飛機失事太多，若干胆怯及年老中委，多不敢以命試機。此外，另一原因乃若干身為軍人中委，以共軍刻正發動春季攻勢，須坐鎭指　，因此無法抽身。當今晨召開預備　議時，吳秘書長鐵城曾宣布「本次出席之中央執行委員，缺席者根據總　第卅五條之規定，到會之候補執行　員四十六人，均可依次照額遞補，在會議中有臨時表決權」。</p>
<p>揭幕禮在陵園</p>
<p>本屆三中全會揭幕典禮，係在總理陵國舉行，時間在謁陵之後，九時卅分預備會議開會地點，則在去冬召開國民大會之國民大會堂，堂內原有座席二千零五十八個，在國大開會期間尙感不敷。而此次出席中靈僅二百五十三人，故會塲至為空落。此外，會塲內外之設備，布置等等，亦遠不及國大時期多甚，故又另呈一番景象。上决各地報社派遣來京採訪國大消息之記者，為數達三百五十餘人，入塲記者亦達百數十人，此次來京者寥寥，中央社旁聽全會消息者，亦不及十人，大會經費為三千萬元，職員共的近三百人，由中央黨部等各機關原有人員中抽調担任之，每日每人津貼一萬元。</p>

<h3>我駐蘇大使館發表聲明　拒絕參加非正式會　莫洛托夫已放棄原來建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十五日廣播：中國大使館正式拒絕參加三强非正式會議後，馬歇爾與貝文均已重新考慮莫洛托夫關於討論中國局勢之建議。馬貝二氏認為不應首先討論中國問題。在另一方面，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫已準備不再堅持討論中國局勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十五日電〕我駐蘇大使館刻發表聲明稱：「茲因蘇外長莫洛托夫函美國務卿馬歇爾及英外相貝文，建議召開三外長非正式會議，並由中國代表參加，俾三國供給其實施一九四五年有關中國之莫斯科會議公報之情報，故中國外長王世杰特於今日由莫斯科中國大使館向馬歇爾及貝文表示，中國政府不能參加或同意此項會議。」傳秉常大使在發表上述聲明前，曾於今晨往訪馬歇爾及貝文，與二氏討論各一小時廿分之久。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾元帥，曾詢問中國願吾接受莫洛托夫之建議，出席外長會議，討論一九四五年莫斯科三外長對華聲明之報吿。我駐蘇大使　秉常，十五日已將王外長之　文，送交馬歇爾元帥及英外相貝文，幷請其轉達蘇外長莫洛托夫。覆文之內容如下：一九四五年莫斯科三外長對華聲明，未經中國政府參加，且因該聲明以中國內政為對象，深為中國人民所反對。蓋中國人民八年抗戰，其目的原在爭取自由獨立。該項聲明，實不免損傷其獨立自主之心也，故中國政府對於蘇外長所提議，以討論一九四五年對華聲明為目的之外長會議，不能參加或同意。中國與英蘇美為並肩作戰之國，相互尊重其地位與其國民自尊心，實屬十分必要。茲鄭重要求美蘇英三外長，停止涉及中國內政問題之任何討論。</p>

<p>葛氏談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕台灣省行政長官公署秘書長葛敬恩，十四日中午專機飛抵京，並歡迎白部長赴台。記者往訪，叩詢台灣現狀，葛氏發表談話如下二上月廿八日台北發生暴動，此事原因由於日本統治時代遺留之鷹犬，與近由海外遣回三台籍浪人，受奸徒煽惑，乘專賣局執行查緝私烟機會，即鼓動排斥外省人，製造恐怖事件，擾亂治安，旋經政府愼重處置，目前交通如鐵路，公路等均已暢通，秩序亦漸恢復，全省各縣市均已照常辦公。至中央　派部隊赴台，原為保護善良人民，免為少數暴徒所刦持，現人民對政府措施，均已瞭解，頗有一部份參加附和者，深自悔悟，有前來謝過者。今後台省如不受外來之挑撥離問，當能迅速恢復常態。關於省政改制問題，台省公署早有改組政府之意，一俟中央核准，即可實施，縣市長實行民選，亦早在準備，並可於行憲前提前實行。日前報載「台灣旅滬代表團抵台後行動失去自由」，又謂：「台灣各業領袖二百餘人仍被監禁，另有學生二十餘人被拘，」均非事實，省旅滬代表團抵台時已傍晚，適値戒嚴，爲安全計，勸勿外出，並非禁止其自由，且白部長代表同住一旅社，理應保護。合北戒嚴司令部日來確已緝獲少數暴徒，此輩於本月八九日曾參加刦奪軍用倉庫，襲擊軍政機關，經審訊後情節較微者均已陸續釋放云。</p>

<h3>台灣旅京滬六團體代表在滬招待記者發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣旅京滬六團體代表張維賢，李偉光，陳重光等所組織之台灣二二八慘案慰問團，於十一日乘國防都專機赴台，因情勢惡劣，當於次晨返京。該團於昨日下午二時假靑年會，招待本市新聞界，由李偉光報吿組織該團赴台慰問動機及此行經過〔詳見十四日本報第版〕，並發表書面聲明，略稱：</p>
<p>事變肇因</p>
<p>此次二二八事變，完全係台胞不滿台灣特殊之行政長官，專賣，貿易統制等制度及台省官吏貪汚橫行，致使人民不能生活，逼成事變。渠指稱：在台灣新竹縣民政科某科長家中，攫出一八〇萬台幣及該科長五十四顆私章一事，足見台省官吏貪汚之一斑。</p>
<p>起事份子</p>
<p>渠復分析此次參加事變之份子，至為複雜，（一）為戰時被日本徵調南洋，海南島各地作戰之台人四萬餘名，戰後　為一般中堅份子，包括一部份參議員，學生，具有政治要求；（三）為日本前在台灣指揮下之流氓及地下人員，乘機活動，離間台胞與內地同胞之感情，對外省同胞之各　殘酷殺傷，均係渠　所爲。至一般台胞絕無排斥外省同胞心理。陳儀對此輩流氓及地下人員向取保議態度；（四）陳儀妄向中央報吿，此次暴動係共黨份子從中策動，實屬飾過之詞，蓋雖不敢斷　台灣絕無共產黨之活動，即有為數甚少，不足以發動如此廣大之事變。</p>
<p>武器來源</p>
<p>至於此次事變之武器來源，據稱：係日人前年投降時將一部份武器埋藏於深山中，或散佈民間，長官公署迭獲密報，陳儀均置之未理，後由台灣旅京滬人士向國防部證實後，陳　乃一度僱工人山發掘，各工終以不發工資，且無生命保障，遂致輟工。成為此次暴動之武器來原。</p>
<p>兩點要求</p>
<p>該團末提出要求主席諾言，在憲法允許範圍內，立即取消長官制，專　制，貿易統制制，並明令將陳儀撤職嚴辦；（二）政府對於台　善後，避免使用武力，並保證不再追究參加台變之人民，號召地方公正人士勸導各業復業，安定秩序，</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>決不參加會外討論中國問題</h3>
<p>我國政府已於十四日經由外交途徑，向英美法蘇四國，鄭重聲明，無論在會內會外討論中國問題，中國決不派代表參加。這一個外交措施，實在是我國外交當局最賢明的抉擇，當為全國人民一致所擁護。</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫想策動英美蘇三國共同干涉中國內政，所以在莫斯科會議開幕的第一天，就提出建議，要求將中國問題列入議程內：殊不料莫洛托夫的輕舉妄動，竟引起了國際上的軒然大波。不僅受其侮辱的中國四萬五千萬人民，發出抗議的怒吼；就是其他各國正義感的人士，也無不表示不平，這種荒謬的建議，決非英國外相貝文與美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥所能同意。在第二决會議中，莫洛托夫本人也深知其建議的毫無理性，不得不看風轉篷，放棄了原來的建議，而改採貝文外相的折衷辦法，同意中國問題由英美蘇三國外長，在會外作非正式的討論：同時馬歇爾國務卿又堅持着他的一貫主張：苟無中國代表參加，卽不得討論中國問題，使莫洛托夫也接受了馬帥的意見，同意中國派遣代表參加。莫洛托夫的態度，雖不免前踞後恭有失外交家的風度；但在他的內心，依舊洋洋得意，而認為只要英美蘇三國外長在莫斯科討論中國問題，不問在會內會外，或其他方式，就不難達成其策動三國共同于涉中國內政的目的。所以我們反對國際干涉，還要堅持到底，不論在會內會外，或其他方式，討論中國問題，我們仍要表示堅決反對，以粉碎莫洛托夫策動國際干涉的迷夢。</p>
<p>我們在莫斯科會議開幕的一天，就表示我們的意見，希望四强不要把中國問題列入議程內，並謂四强能否尊重我國人民的公意，就是外長會議的一大考騐。後來我們聽到了莫洛托夫的提議，更不能不大聲疾呼，反對國際千涉，並抗議莫洛托夫的侮辱態度。現在我們仍本這種基本態度，表示反對會外討論中國問題。我們向來非常珍惜中蘇兩國間的友誼，決不感情用事，我們雖已遭受到莫洛托夫不能容忍的侮辱；但是我們的理智力仍能抑制住戚情的泛濫，所以我們反對會外討論中國問題，並不是依據了主觀的感情作用，而是出之於我們冷靜的理智？茲將我們的理由，分述如下：</p>
<p>第一，蘇聯要求三國外長討論中國問題，不論在會內會外或其他方式，都懷着策動國際干涉中國內政的陰謀，不僅違背了中蘇友好同盟條約，而且也破壞了聯合國憲章。莫洛托夫須知，中國不是一個戰敗國，而是一個功勞卓著不容否認的戰勝國；蘇聯不但承認中國是聯合國安全理事會五常任理事國之一，戰後外長會議五會員國之一；而且與中國還訂有友好同盟條約，蘇聯怎可將與其處於同等地位的友邦的國內問題提出來討論呢！又怎可策動他國共同來干涉呢！所以在莫洛托夫的心目之中，有沒有聯合國憲章？有沒有波茨坦協定？有沒有中蘇友好同盟條約？使我們不能不表示懷疑。國際關係以信義為第一，像蘇聯這樣的國家，如無信義可言，則我們怎能盼望她列於强國之羣領導各國共同締造世界和平？</p>
<p>第二，世界各國的人民對於第二次大戰後的世界，莫不渴望其早日步入和平民主的時代，使人類不再有遭受戰禍威脅之虞；但是這個理想如何始能實現？大家一致認爲，促成戰禍的「強權政治」「秘密外交」等等不祥的名稱，不應再見於戰後和平民主的世界。但是在事實上，現在却大謬不然，一九四五年二月問的雅爾達會議，對於中國問題竟作秘密決議，一九四五年十二月間的莫斯科會議，又未得我國的參加而發表有關於我國的宣言，這一切的一切，無不使我國人民痛深惡絕。今後我們決不願見國際政治上重演「秘密外交」的把戲；更不願見「强權政治」的復活，否則世界和平集體安全，都是欺世騙人之名詞，人類將永無自由生活和平相處的希望。</p>
<p>第三，中國國內的問題，雖極嚴重，但是我們相信一定有自謀解決之道，中國人民是至大至剛的民族，飽經內憂外患，最終必能克服任何困列强儘可放心；中國國內的問題，只要沒有國際背景，使其更加複雜，決不致危及國際間的和平。所以莫洛托夫以「中國局勢未見改善」為藉口，欲討論中國問題，實在沒有理由可言。至於我國請求美國出面調處國共問題，係出於自動，故當馬帥來華斡旋和平時，全國人民曾一致表示熱烈歡迎；迨至其聲明放棄調處時，我們也沒有強求，自不能認為美國干涉中國內政。而今莫斯科會議，在其開慕之前，我國外交當局早已聲明，不得將中國問題列入議程內，英法美三國外長一致表示同意，就是蘇聯政府也未表示異議，當可且為默認；可是到了開會之後，莫洛托夫偏偏要提出中國問題來討論，至遭否決之後，仍要求在會外討論。莫洛托夫的居心所在，是顯而易見的。現在中國已表示堅決反對，並決定不派代表參加，如果英美蘇三國外長仍不顧中國人民之意志，悍然加以討論，這才是不可饒恕的干涉中國內政！絕不能與美國調處混為一談的！</p>
<p>由上所述，我國反對國際干涉，不容許英美蘇三國討論中國問題，不論在會內會外，都是理直氣壯的，除了別有企圖的莫洛托夫而外，凡是正義感的人士。對於我國的抗議無不表示同情，尤其是馬歇爾國務卿與貝文外相，決不會受莫洛托夫的欺騙的。觀於英美外長的遲不答覆莫洛托夫的函件，前途已趨於黯淡，就是一個絕好的明證。而且中國政府業已經由外交途徑，通知四國，表示中國無論在會外會內討論中國問題，決不派代表麥加。萬一英美蘇三國竟非正式討論中國問題，不論其作何決議，我國均可不受拘束，故其結果，不致影響及我國，而徒見莫洛托夫的心勞日拙而已。</p>

<h3>推進德國政治民主化　馬歇爾建議五點　四外長宣布德戰俘數字</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十四日電〕馬歇爾國務　今日向外長會議提出關於推進德國民主之　面聲明，提出柏林會議　令盟國管制分員會準備德國民主政治生活之復興、及德國之　國際生活和平合作。　　此項指令，　有更明確之規定，期使四區推進　國民主政治之程序　以統一　認唯有在德國，盟國始有機會向世界昭示大西洋及聯合國　　關於民主目標之誠意，由於德國各區關於政治經濟自由之保障欠缺協議，乃使德人不能一致準備民主政治之重建，此項於　後所施行之限制，今日已必須予以取消。僅　消滅納粹勢力，不足以使德國民主化，必須有積極的行動，以使　人恢復其政治及經濟的民主生活。馬歇爾在其聲明中，又指出民主主義常作多種解釋，美國政府及人民認為人類據有不容剝奪的若干種基本權利，包括使每一個人在不侵犯他人權利之原則下，自由發展其思想，不受恐嚇脅迫等，一個社會以內若尊重他人權利之人，不獲自由表示其信念，該社會即不得視為民主，若守法公民處在被剝奪生命財產愉快式工作權利之恐懼中，該社會即非自由。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十四日電〕茲分誌馬卿所提五點基本計劃如次：（一）一致保證德國人民所應享受之一切基本民權；（二）保證政黨有參加自由竸選權；（三）保證自由貿易；（四）保證德國各地報章與電台之自由；（五）保證德國各地人民與貨物之行動自由。</p>
<p>馬卿繼提出報告稱，美軍佔領區內現有德軍戰俘三萬另九百七十六人，茲已定於六月間加以理　。　謂，民主政治之意義，各人所見不問，但美政府對此有一基本定義，即人權不能加以轉移　予取予奪，以言報章與電台自由，其與民主政治及自由即有不可分離之關係。末稱，美軍占領區內原有兵工廠一百十七所，現已有八十所加以拆毀，餘者將於本年加以毀滅云。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫至此發表其意見稱，余對於第四點，不能與馬卿苟同，待後再予以答覆。</p>
<p>英外相　文宣稱，英國現仍拘有德軍戰俘四十三萬五千二百九十五人，每月有一萬七千五百人送至英國國內工作，但自七月一日起，每月將有二萬人，續批加以還送回國。法外長皮杜爾申稱，法國現拘有六十三萬一千四百八十三人，其中五十萬人在法國境內工作。</p>
<p>關於人民之交換與移動問題以及領土之劃分問題四國外長定明日會議討論。此外賠償問題亦將提出討論，但莫洛托夫要求尚需時間計算確數，聞蘇聯所擬要求德賠償之數額為百億美元。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十五日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫今晨向其他三國外長報告稱：蘇聯目前當留有德戰俘八十九萬零五百卅二人，然渠並未說明德境蘇佔領區內現有戰俘若干。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十五日電〕關于蘇聯國內之德戰俘人數，十五日塔斯社莫斯科廣播中已提出答　稱：自戰爭結束以來，共遣返德戰俘一百萬零三千九百七十四人，現留在蘇境者尚有八十九萬零五百卅二人。</p>
<h3>開幕以來已一星期　外長會一無成就　四外次會議亦陷僵局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十五日廣播：四强外長會議展幕迄今已一星期，毫無進展。目前遭遇三大難題：（一）中國拒絕參加會外討論後，美英蘇三國採取另一新步驟，至爲困難；（二）如何處置仍在德境集中營之數十萬難民；（三）如何改組德國內部。今日四外次開會後，形成僵局，蘇聯代表要求准許阿爾巴亞參加對德和約談判，已遭美英兩國拒絕，結果延會，下週再行談判。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十五日電〕毫無成就之四國外長會議在如此滿城風雲之空氣中，於下午四時舉行其本星期之末次會議，討論德國難民集中營千萬流浪人民之處置問題，以及德國國境之劃分問題。四國外　照常在上午十一時集會，然因莫斯科和平空氣之消失，故亦無　成就之希望，如外次不能打開僵局，則關於德奧和約之爭端祇有呈交外長會議。外次會議中主要之紛歧之一，爲英美法同意興國能有五萬五千人之軍隊，而蘇聯要求限於五萬之內，俾使不超過其巴爾幹　國之軍力。蘇聯又提議奧軍之武器僅限於本國製造，禁止其　外國購買，然英美　　如此將防碍奧國之主權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十五日電〕　莫斯科廣播：外次會議因英美拒絕阿爾巴尼亞列　對德和約之討論而　於停頓。蘇聯要求阿爾巴尼亞　　南斯拉夫·波蘭·捷克等同時參加對德和約之會議，然英美則認爲　國會幫助軸心國作戰者，特別因其繼從德國侵略　　，故不允所　。莫斯科廣播中稱：外次會議對此並未獲得任何協議，故延期至下星期一討論。何國應參加討論對德和約之基本問題至今　而　　。如若僵局在下星期仍不能打開，則　能將爭論　報告外長會議。</p>

<h3>麥帥發表最近佔領報告　分析日本共黨活動策略</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十五日電〕麥帥最近之佔領報告，除稱道民主化之成就外，又指出日本共黨最近在努力活動，企圖組織反政府之聯合陣綫。報告中分析共產黨之策略稱：「共黨在國會中　擊政府之經濟政策，並宣佈履行憲法之「民主」立法程序。在國會外企圖通過工會與農民組織，促進反政府活動，隨時與社會民主黨覓取協調。」</p>
<p>該報告中並稱，在各地方機構中，共黨決定放棄其本黨之候選人，而支持由各工會與人民組織所提名之「民主」侯選人，在國會中共黨支持社會民主黨之內閣。共黨繼續爭取中小商人與農民支持反吉田內閣之聯合陣綫。</p>
<p>關於治安問題，該報告中稱，十二月之罷工與示威事件已形減少，然尙有若干破壞活動。</p>
<p>本屆國會四項要案</p>
<p>報告中又提及日本趨向於真正之民主極有進步。自十一月二十六日至十二月二十五日之第九十一屆緊急國會中，以二百三十六示對一百六十票否決解散吉田內閣之議案。本屆國會中所通過之四項重要法案為：（一）選舉參議院替代貴族院；（二）將來之內閣須向國會負責；（三）限制宮內省之權力；（四）皇室財產將屬於國家。</p>
<h3>遠東委員會決定　限制日消耗物資</h3>

<h3>日臨時賠償計劃　蘇聯已表示同意　但不允扣除自東北移走物資</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕遠東委員會頃稱：蘇聯已同意美國之計劃，授權麥帥將日本工業所規定之臨時賠償，計百分之三十，發給各急需之國家，但蘇聯要求要分配其應得之一份時，不能將蘇聯自東北所移走之工業設備，加以扣除。</p>

<h3>英援助希臘問題　下院曾展開激烈辯論　最後決定續貸一千九百萬鎊</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕下議院今日通過　　一千九百萬磅援助希臘，其中一千八百萬磅作爲希臘軍費之補助，一百萬磅用以採辦民用物品贈與希臘。在辯論時，外次麥克尼爾曾講英政府極　聯合國之希臘調查　提出永久性或半永久性之　　。英國政府對此項建議將予支持。渠並曰希臘政府不論其係左傾或右傾。必須有維持秩序之軍隊。前保守黨外長艾登，在辯論時曾述及希臘之政局。渠　在希臘建立聯合內閣至爲困難，並曰戰時曾為敵國之保加利亞尚且具有軍隊，則盟邦希臘當然應有軍隊。渠又指　保政府之領袖，不值與任何國家維持友誼。渠主張由英政府在經濟方面援希，購買剩餘之希臘菸草，此舉當較今日　論之案更爲有效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕下院工黨議員三人今日宣布將於十六日要求政府說明英國對美國總統杜魯門援助希臘與土耳其計劃之關聯。政府方面人士稱：英　將於十七日例會中討論杜魯門之聲明。</p>

<h3>杜魯門援助希土方案　國會决予以支持　對外求濟法案將優先討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統要求援助希土一案已獲國會支持，惟一之反對殆值就條款略加限制而已。共和黨參議員埃根宣稱，際危急之秋，國會除與總統採取一致行動外似無他事可作。參院外交委員民主黨領袖康納利預料總統提案可獲兩院大多數通過。某共和黨領袖則　，國會改變總統援助希土　務之惟一辦法，乃將該款予以扣留，但莫斯科方面或將　　此舉示　，故國會舍與總統一致外，殆無他途可循。參院外交委員會主席范登堡今日向共和黨同僚提出機密報告一件，離席時，　有問題多端，須待政府答復。該項問題牽涉財政與軍事援助之各方面以及其所可能引起之反響。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕衆外交委員會今日與共和黨及政府官員會商三小時後，已同意在下週初公開聽取對杜魯門建議以四億美元貸款，援助希臘與土耳其抵　共產主義一事之意見。衆料雖政府　　必須迅速援助希土二國，以免東地中之失却均勢，但總統所提三億五千萬美元一項對外救濟法案，當將優先加以討論云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕國會議員方面今日推測，美國施行防共政策之後，除杜魯門總統　　國會核准之四億美元對希臘土耳其貸款外，至少將有伊朗，敘利亞，黎巴嫩，匈牙利及巴勒斯坦等五國或者亦須向美國借款。</p>
<p>希臘歡迎美國援助</p>
<p>〔合衆社雅典十四日電〕此間今日各商店皆暫停營業二小時，舉行遊行，感謝美國援助希臘之計劃，總理馬克西莫斯特經由土耳其大使，致電土國政府，申　希土二國在目前已站於和民主政治之同一路綫上。同時外長　爾達里斯接見南非大使，有所會談，因此復盛傳南非與加拿大亦極關懷希臘之復興。共黨領袖柴却里召斯則在「里索斯巴斯蒂斯報」發表一文，指斥美國此舉乃在干涉希臘之內政，具有帝國主義之野心，杜魯門之演說並已危及聯合國之任務，而將引起更多之流血事件云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社阿根廷京城十五日電〕此間獲悉：巴拉圭北部全境除夏哥城以外已盡入叛軍手中，但在此內戰七日期間，政府軍尙未與發生大戰。觀察家談稱：夏哥城警備司令格基里上校仍持中立態度，故局勢關鍵現緊於該地，城內僅有軍隊一團，已加入叛軍，星期三夜叛軍企圖攻佔平那斯哥城，始曾發生戰事，但至翌晨拂曉，即被擊退。目前殆因雙方交通均感困難，故無大戰發生巴拉圭京城與叛軍總部所在地之康賽清與城相去六十哩之遙，僅有巴拉圭河相通，鐵路綫則已被叛軍切斷，復因淫雨連綿，水流甚急，致航行困難，故政府軍尙難馳往該地討伐。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕此間外交界人士談稱：巴拉圭之內亂，暫時尙屬內政問題，但可能即將引起國際問題之反應。本月六日該國各地發生動亂，京城首先發難，但迅即　平。傳該國內政部長已正式譴責前總統弗蘭哥上校為此一陰謀之主動者，而係共黨所　起。叛軍對此即申明並無黨派性質，僅欲以民主政權代替現政府而已。外交界人士繼稱：上年七月該國之　　，繼理莫里尼哥卒獲進步黨之合作，始　保全政權，此次情形則　　複　，美國與阿根廷現皆密切加以注意。阿根廷總統貝隆之政府　能全力支持莫里尼哥，美國則不同，須待探明叛變原因是否爲樹產民主政府抑爲政黨之　突後，始能決定其態度云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美水手刀傷三輪車夫案，被告羅吉士，昨晨由地院呂紹昌推事宣判，公訴不受理，原告之訴駁回。被告准交一千萬元現金保釋放。其判決理由略謂：告訴乃論之罪，其告訴經撤回者，應論知不受理之判決，該案檢察官起訴時，因被害人病狀係難治之傷害，認爲重傷，依刑法第二百七十七條第二項後段起訴（非告訴乃論罪），而被害人之傷，現旣治愈，檢察官亦當庭聲明變更起訴法條，旣非重傷，本案即屬刑法第二七十七條第一項，第二百八十七條告訴乃論之案件，然則公訴應否管理，以被害人是否撤回告訴爲斷，而被害人撤回刑事告訴，已據於一月二十九日具狀聲明在卷，且經査明被害人程榮芳簽字，未受脅騙，精神淸晰，故自屬有效之法律行爲。吳推事並論知，民訴部份，可向民庭提起自訴。</p>

<h3>北靑在津連傳捷報　華勝津電俱受挫</h3>
<p>長春五虎體力充沛球藝可觀</p>
<p>〔本報天津航訊〕長春北靑籃球隊遠征天津，首戰旗開得勝，擊敗中紡一廠隊，十日晚八時，在耀華體育館作二次賽，一帆風順，又以六十八比四十四勝津勁旅電信局隊。十一日晚第三戰對美兵第一師團，美兵實力雄厚，曾挫津電華勝，北靑力戰敗北，比數七十九比四十九。十二日晚第四戰對華勝，觀衆達二千餘人，耀華塲宣吿客滿，竟有跳牆而入者。結果北靑球運亨通，以五十比三十六，再勝華勝。北靑長力充沛，為其得勝主因。</p>
<p>大勝津電　對津電之戰，北靑士氣如虹，一帆風順，劉健華田福海，何佩左右逢源，一氣呵成十六分，津電空前敗覆，第一節二十比六，上半時三十六比十三。王維國回樹生互有建樹，第三節為五十四比二十六。最後一節津電已回生乏術，主將紀乃珍罰滿離塲，王世富獨木難支，結果六十八比四十四。</p>
<p>敗於美兵　對美兵之戰，客隊怵於美兵身高力大，復不　三秒鐘規則，以致手足失措，第一節十六比九落後，第二節主將劉健華及後衛何佩俱被美裁判罰滿下塲，大感威脅，上半時三四比二二。下半時北靑竭力反攻，奈美兵投擲奇準，第三節六一比三五。美兵用車輪戰法，生力軍猖獗異常，結果七九比四九。</p>

<h3>紡建公司及民營紗廠　請求調整棉紗限價　在三六五萬元以內互相買賣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司於昨日下午四時許，召開董事會議。經濟部王部長親自出席主持，到王仰先·歐陽侖·楊錫仁·束　章·李升伯·吳味經·王輝等。　程如次：（一）報告公司一年來生產情形及最近產銷狀況。（二）錦州營口遼陽安東等地公司所　收之　產紗厰，共有紗錠廿萬枚，現已有十萬枚開工。至各厰重要人員，由董事會分別派充。（三）公司發　民營，原則業已確定。惟究採發行股票或標售方式，則待國營　業發　民營之計劃委員會决定。（四）公司對原料之供應，極力從收購國棉着手。迄目前為止，已收約一百萬担，望能再收三四十萬担。此外尚須補充外棉約卅五萬担云。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司及各民營紗廠，因棉花成本昂漲，而紗價始終未曾調整，近向紡管會請求增加限價，頃經紡管會决定，紗價以廿支為標準，紡建公司之價格原為二百五十萬，擬增至三百二十五萬，民營紗廠可在三百六十五萬以內互相買賣，該項價格現已呈請經濟部核准中，核准后即可頒佈實施。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕六區棉紡公會議價小組會，於昨日上午十一時許，在紡建公司舉行會議。討論經過，對三月份之棉紗收購價格，已作初步之决定。聞廿支標準紗之最高價，已定為三百零數萬元。該項議價，將由王子建送呈吳兼主委核議。又對民營各厰自由買賣之厰盤價，决定按成本價加合法利潤計算，廿支標準紗之最高價，已定為三百九十九萬元。以上價格，均將提交明日紡管會臨時會議席上討論核定。然後交由經濟部王部長携京作最後之核定云。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會再請　撤銷南運紗布禁令</h3>
<p>南運紗布禁令，六區紡織公會迭向紡管會要求開放，但紡管會以棉紗市價未趨穩定，一旦撤銷禁令，難免刺激物價，該項請求迄今未予核准。現六區公會以收購棉紗價格已不敷成本，各紗厰銷路受阻，更難維持。爰特重行陳述理由，要求紡管會解除禁令，聞紡管會轉向經部請示中。茲控誌其請求解禁理由於後：查前頒禁止棉紗布南運一案，推源政府當時　項措施，原為該時物價動盪不定。而作一時權宜之計，并非永久國策。本會曾於上年九月聞陳述各紗厰之困難，暨華南紗布需要之迫切情形，請求撤銷禁令。嗣於同年十一月間會商决定收購民營紗廠生產棉紗半數之時，又經本會出席委員口頭交換意見，俟收購棉紗實行之時，同時取銷南運禁令，當蒙贊同。現在收購工作既已實現，上海附近各埠存貨，且已充沛，足敷供應。而目下上海市場銷路呆頓，棉紗市價亦趨穩定。惟依照目前價格，實不敷成本，加以各厰銷路遭受阻塞，乃致收入銳减，而經常支出，一時又難緊縮。處此收支不能平衡之困難下，勢將因遭受窒息而坐以待斃。閔粤等地紗布需要殷切，政府原應顧念民生，統籌兼顧，當不忍視南方民眾無衣蔽體，尤不忍視民營紗厰遏絕生機。故此項禁令之取銷，自不容再事猶豫，致難挽救。特請維持原議，即日撤銷禁止，以維工業。</p>
<h3>紗厰收購國棉　靜候四聯貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市參議會前曾提案，希望各紗廠儘量收購浦東火機棉花，增進棉農經濟。紡管會曾數度會商，除函請農林部從速督促改良棉種外，並令飭紡建公司及第六區棉紡工會轉飭各厰，於紡製粗支紗時，儘可能採用國棉。如收購需款，可將擬購數量報會，以憑代向四聯總處洽商抵押借款。現各厰擬購者計有中國紡建公司購二萬至三萬担，偉昌二百担，恒昌一千担，恒大三千担，恒通六千担，大新一千二百担，華新一千担，海麟三千担，勤　一千担，申新擬購數量尚未定。以上各厰俟貨款核准後，即可開始收購云。</p>
<h3>細紗貨稀價升</h3>
<p>昨日紗市穩定逾恒，津帮買賣不絕，故念支紗以紅魁及天女為獨俏，其於各支亦跟漲兩三萬元。細紗因貨根極少，三十二支漲十萬左右，四十支以上亦漲十萬至十五萬之譜。</p>
<h3>複製業澈查　配紗流入黑市</h3>
<p>本市複製棉織品業厰商公會，以會員對於紡建公司配售棉紗，係不准轉讓或至市場買賣。乃最近竟有上項情事發生，殊足影響同業信譽。茲悉該公會等除通告全體所屬會員嚴行自肅外，並派員嚴密調查，如有同業會員不法行為，噹隨時向當局檢舉。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕警備部經濟組於日前查獲紗布場外交易案一件，係中南棉織厰售出，永隆布厰買進，並由名王　　者所經手，為數頗鉅。紗業公會已予呈報證明，經濟組將予究辦。</p>
<h3>棉布客銷仍旺</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，客路去化仍張。元布　　，天津帮及各地客帮零星處仍有　　，行情堅穩。細布中檔貨本　門莊帮及厰家，仍有吸　，故其脚地較堅。如十二磅龍頭細布較上日軋升，價為十五萬六千五百元，嗣以紡建公司照例開售白坯布，掛牌二十支細布價比上日减低二千元，人心逐轉平軟，其餘斜紋布及士林布安安藍布等，去化不暢，行情升降互見。</p>
<h3>人絲賣風濃厚</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲利賣空氣甚濃，繼續下挫。一二〇號高山有光週一期票喊六百三十萬元，尚乏受主，比上日又小十萬元。其餘半光等亦因有光連朝挫跌，昨减價亦帶小一二十萬元之譜。厰經市况仍歸靜寂，减價大致疲軟，普通零担，六百八十至九十萬元之間有成交，綱貨奄奄無生氣。被面乏做開，大誠格子璧縐掛牌一萬六千七百元，六千五百元有成交，不過為數甚微。華錦縐軋跌二百元，絲羽紗有去　，價站定。</p>
<h3>中央銀行負責人談　金融政策勿加臆測</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕市上謠傳對外匯率將有改低之說，據中央銀行負責人談，本行金融政策以穩定為第一義，過去市上對於經濟金融措施，輒多揣測，以致引起市場不安，希望社會人士對於政府金融措施，在未有明令變更以前，切勿任加臆測，以免搖惑人心，而予投機者以機會。</p>
<h3>統債上漲</h3>
<p>公債昨已回升，銀根鬆濫，業外買戶仍殷，空方亦有補進略告上漲。統丙　開九〇〇〇元，低價見八三〇〇元，而後逐步盤升至一〇五〇〇元，收市徘徊而已。甲乙自五五〇〇元丁自六二〇〇元統戊自六七〇〇元，俱以高價結束。結果較前收計甲乙漲四百元，統丙升一二〇〇元，丁戊各好五百元，成交達一千餘萬元。</p>
<h3>外股平穩</h3>
<p>外股昨極升降俱微。怡紗　開一八六〇〇元，高價不過一八八〇〇元，低價一八四〇〇元，最後穩定，結果較前收各股榮辱咸微，橡皮股亦見平定。</p>
<h3>米糧店胃轉殷</h3>
<p>昨米市南北共到八千二百石左右，天氣轉陰，內地產價尚昂，店胃轉殷。粳米北市挺升一二千元，南市挺昂二三千元，麩米亦漲二千元。白元依然平平，陰元亦少出入。麵粉零消略動，洋粉見高千元，本粉堅定，市勢暫成乍升乍降。　皮貨主甚堅，回升千元。豆餅先緊後平，略加三四百元。</p>
<h3>三萬五千噸大豆　本月下旬運往英法</h3>
<p>中糧公司與中信局二機構，近自葫蘆島起運大豆來滬，擬於本月下旬出口，總額為三五〇〇〇噸。輸法一萬噸，英荷二萬五千噸。東北大豆價格每斤三十五流通券，折合法幣八十四萬元一噸。由東北轉滬運英，成本一六〇萬元，現在英國市價每噸約合二〇〇至二一〇萬間。且東北大豆政府規定凡直接經營出口者，得由水陸聯營，優先裝出，我國大豆　出戰前年達二五〇萬噸，去歲輸出總值二億五千萬美金。其中百分之八十為國營專業產品輸出。大豆一项，價值五千萬美金。</p>
<p>黃豆到貨　　，汕頭本街動而不旺，　　站局，惟漢口　　挺千元。茶豆仍居疲軟之格，赤豆暫無呼吸，紅豆回挫一二千元。紅糧連日下游，物極思反之狀，轉挺千元。苞米去化仍然不濃，平平之象。　豆再以疲　，步跌三五千元。芝蔴挺秀。</p>
<p>生油　　來電報小人心不　，蔴油平庸，豆油東北長江均有到源，供源持續，市形少神。生仁廣帮略有問津，回升三五千元，市成　起　落之狀。</p>
<h3>桐油做開甚少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週末桐油做開甚少，價站原盤。漢口來貨既源源不絕，杭州方面，亦有大批湧到，惟　中人認為桐油到貨難多，價格不致軟化，因產地價格，尚無傾跌　微。杭州　損為卅五萬元（足度略高，）漢口方面，據行商電話，前市做價足度白油為卅六萬五千元，價稍軟化。</p>
<h3>華股市況由疲轉穩　專櫃電話動工人心為之一振</h3>
<p>華股昨初疲後稱，空方着手補進，巨額交易　已動工接電話，人心反動回振，而以高價結束。晨開見低，二二三號二二號一八五號一四三號一〇〇號均趁低來進，　永紗開後升至二八七〇元。二二二號六一號八七號一八〇號八二號有售，　永紗近低至二七五〇元。七六一一號二號二二三號一八五號二一八號一九七號四七號均有吸收升至二九〇〇元。散多咸加脫手，一四號則進，是以雖低而尚盤。二三五號三二號亦進，升至二九三〇元。十時半，走入　途。一一七號四號五二號一二三號脫手，低至二八五〇元。一四號一九八號一八〇號八五號一五六號有納，電話公司已派人前來裝置巨額交易櫃對講綫，影響人心，而漲到二九七〇元。散多及二二六號一九〇號一三一號賣至二八五〇元。五和漲停，一四號二三五號二二四號均納，午收又見回上。新亞亦告漲停，結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐新光中法微升，景福由二〇四號吸收，漲起半成。勤興信和各升一成弱，新華漲一成強，遞交計永紗信和美亞華豐新光景福各漲半成弱迄一成弱不等。冷股新亞五和漲停，國貨麗安微降，中紡升一成，榮豐統益大通火柴景綸水泥內衣各升裝成，餘微升而已。場外各股極為平穩。</p>
<h3>滬鬃腳地甚堅</h3>

<h3>杜魯門之呼籲　請求國會貸款希土　支持協助自由民族　演說詞全文　美國新聞處</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統今日（華盛頓十二日）在此間國會兩院特別聯席會議上，發表重要外交政策演說，請求畀予希臘與土耳其以四億美元之援助。總統亦曾請求批准派遣美國公務與軍事人員赴希土兩國，協助復興工作，並督導美國援助之用途。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統稱：在目前灰暗之時局下「幾乎所有國家必須在二種生活方式中挑選一種，我相信美國政策必是支持自由人民，抵抗少數武裝力量或外力的統治企圖。」</p>
<p>總統繼指出希臘內戰以及希臘政府最近致美國之牒文，請求給予金融上經濟上之援助。</p>
<p>總統之言言有云：「希臘國家之生存，今日受到數千武裝人員恐怖活動之威脅，此等武裝人員，在共產黨徒領導之下，在若干據點，尤其沿北部邊界，向政府挑戰。聯合國安全理事會所委派之委員會，目下正在調查希臘北部之紛擾情形，以及沿希臘與阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞及南斯拉夫一帶，破壞疆界之事。同時，希臘政府無力應付局勢，希臘陸軍人數旣少，配備又窮劣，欲恢復政府在希臘領土內之權威，必需供應與配備。</p>
<p>希臘自給自尊　美國應予援助</p>
<p>希臘欲成為自給自尊之民主國，必須獲得帮助。美國必須供給此種帮助。吾人固已予希臘以若干種類之救濟及經濟協助，但此尚嫌不足。民主之希臘，除乞援於美國外，別無其他國家可向求助，除美國外，別無他國願意及有能力對民主之希臘政府，予以必要之支持。</p>
<p>曾一度援希的英國政府，三月卅一日以後已不能再事給以金融或經濟上的援助。英國深感其自身對於世界若干地區（包括希臘在內）之義務，必須减輕或淸算。</p>
<p>我人曾考慮到聯合國援助希臘解決危機的問題。然而形勢至為緊急，需要即速的行動，聯合國及其有關機構，當不能給以所需要的某種協助。</p>
<p>希臘曾要求我人援助俾使該國能有效利用我人所能給予之金融或其他援助，並改善其行政設施。此乃値得提起之事。最重要者，厥為我人監督我人援希金錢之用途。務使每一金元之耗費，均有助於希臘自力更生，並協助其建立一發揚民主之經濟。</p>
<p>無絕對完善之政府，民主政府的主要德性在於缺點之顯而易見，且能在民主的進程中加以指出並改正的。希臘政府並非完善的，但確可代表希臘議會百分之八十五人士，希臘議會乃於去年選舉中選出組成者。觀察家（包括美國）咸認為那次大選，頗能表達希臘的民意。</p>
<p>希臘政府向在混亂與極端主義之環境中施政，希臘政府之措施多有錯誤。本國之協助，其意並非謂美國同情希臘政府過去與一切措施。吾人在過去與目前均譴責右派或左派極端性質之措施。吾人過去已勸吿寬容，目下仍勸吿寬容。</p>
<p>確保土國完整　維持中東秩序</p>
<p>希臘之隣國土耳其，亦値得吾人之注意。</p>
<p>作為一個獨立而經濟健全之國家，土耳其之前途，對於世界愛好自由之人民，其重要不下於希臘之前途。土耳其今日所處之環境，與希臘大不相同。土耳其倖免於希臘所遭遇之災害。戰時英美兩國曾以物質之援助供給土耳其，然土耳其目下仍需吾人之支持。</p>
<p>自戰爭以來，土耳其曾向英美乞求經濟之援助，以便實行其維持國家完整所必需之近代化。土耳其之完整，實為維持中東秩序所不可少者。</p>
<p>英政府已通知吾人。謂英國因其自身之困難，已不能再事以金融或經濟上之援助給與土耳其。如希臘然，若土耳其需要援助，美國亦應供應之。吾人實係惟一能予以此種援助之國家。</p>
<p>美國援助希臘及土耳其自有廣泛之困難在，余完全體認此項事實，此刻余即擬與諸位討論此項困難。</p>
<p>美外交政策之一大目標，為創設若干條件，在此種條件下，吾人及其他各國當能創造一種免受壓迫之生活方式。是乃對德日戰爭之基本問題。此等企圖強迫他國採納其一己意志之國家，亦即我人所已戰勝之國家。</p>
<p>為確保各國之和平發展並免受壓迫，美國已負起建立聯合國之領導職責，聯合國之宗旨，厥為促使各會員國均能獲致永久自由獨立。吾人不能實現吾人之目標，除非吾人願協助自由之人民維持其政府及國家完整並反對任何助長獨權政權之侵犯性運動。換言之，此點亦即承認：加諸自由人民之獨裁政權，無論其為直接或間接侵略，均足以貽害國際和平及美國之安全。</p>
<p>反對極權統治　肅淸狡滑手段</p>
<p>世界上反對極權統治之國家與人民甚多，但邇來頗多極權政權統治適加諸其身。美國政府曾屢次抗議在波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞等國破壞雅爾達協定之種種威脅壓迫行為。余亦必須申述，在若干其他國家，亦有類似情事發生。</p>
<p>在目前世界歷史中，幾乎所有國家必在二種生活方式中挑選一種。此種選擇，往往不能十分自由。</p>
<p>一種方式乃基於多數人之願望，表現於自由制度，代讓式政府，自由選舉，個人自由之保障，言論自由，宗敎自由，以及免於政治壓迫之自由。</p>
<p>另一種方式乃基於少數人之願望，以強制加諸多數人。此全賴於恐怖，壓迫，報紙統制，無線電統制，圈定式選舉，以及個人自由之壓制。</p>
<p>余相信美國之政策，端在支持自由之民族以抵抗少數武裝份子或外來壓力之征服版圖。余相信吾人必須協助自由民族依照其自己之方式造成其本身之命運。余相信吾人之援助應在經濟與財政方面着手，此為促使經濟安定與政治上軌之先決條件。</p>
<p>世界並非靜止不動，而現狀亦非神聖不可變易者。但吾人不能容許違反聯合國憲章之變更現狀。如政治滲入一類之狡滑手段。美國在協助自由與獨立國家維持其自由之時，將使聯合國憲章之原則發生效力。</p>
<p>自由制度摧毁　危害整個世界</p>
<p>吾人祗需一觀地圖，即明瞭希臘國家之生存與完整極為重要。希臘若果淪入少數武裝份子控制之下，則對於其鄰國土耳其，勢將發生嚴重之直接影響，甚至可能引起整個中東之混亂。</p>
<p>但希臘萬一消失其獨立國家之地位，則歐洲各國均將蒙受重大之影響。此等國家之人民現正在重大困難中為維持其自由與獨立而奮鬥，一方面尚在修理戰爭中所受之損害。</p>
<p>此等國家，對強力之征募，掙扎已久。彼等曾作重大犧牲，以贏得勝利。今日若將喪失勝利之果，殊為無法形容之悲劇。自由制度之摧毁，獨立之喪失，不僅對彼等有所危害，對整個世界而言，亦復如是。此一命運，將迅速影響及其他確保自由獨立而掙扎之鄰國，使彼命運亦成為沮喪失望與可能之失敗。</p>
<p>在此千鈞一髮之際，吾人茍不能援助希土二國，則其影響之深遠，將不僅限於東方，且將波及西方。</p>
<p>吾人必須立即採取決定性行動。</p>
<p>以是余在此向國會建議：請求批准於一九四八年六月三十日前畀予希土二國四億元之貸款援助。在作此項貸款請求時，余會考慮及在三億五千萬美元救濟金中可能撥為對希援助最大之數目。此乃前此余請求國會批准之款項，其目的在於防免曾受戰爭破壞各國之飢饉與苦難。</p>
<p>貸款之外，余請求國會批准派遣美國公務與軍事人員前往希土二國，以協助該國等復興，並督導美國供給之金融上與物質上援助之用途。蓋以此乃該國等之請求也。余建議國會同時授權吾人敎導並訓練選拔前赴希土二國之工作人員。</p>
<p>投資自由和平　積極負責保障</p>
<p>最後，余　請國會授與權力，俾國會之可能撥款，能獲最迅速與有效之使用，以便供應急切需要之商品，供應品及設備。</p>
<p>此外，為達成本文吿所　述之各項目標，吾人若需要其他款項及權力，余將即速曉吿國會。</p>
<p>在此方面，政府之執行及立法機構必須合作一致。</p>
<p>吾人所趨之途徑至為嚴重，若非其另一途徑更為嚴重，則本人決不發表出此項建議。</p>
<p>為爭取世界大戰之勝利，美國　　　三四一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，此為對於世界自由及世界和平之投資。</p>
<p>余所建議對希臘與土耳其之援助，所費不過稍多於此種投資千分之一而已。吾人應保護此項投資，並確保此項投資之不虛挪，此僅為普通常識而已。</p>
<p>極權政權之種子，受困苦與缺乏之培養。此等種子，在貧窮與爭鬥之劣土中蔓延及生長。當人民要求改善生活之希望消失之時，極權政權之種子即達完全成熟之時期。吾人必須使人民此種希望，保持存在。</p>
<p>世界各地自由民族，均期望吾人之支持，以維持彼等之自由。吾人若果畏縮不前，則吾人可能危害世界之和平，而必然將危及吾人本身之福利。</p>
<p>余深信國會將以極大之勇氣，負起此種責任。</p>
<p>杜魯門演說姿態</p>
<h3>人潮滾動！銀洋跳舞！賭客「天堂」在雷諾　二月二十四日雷諾航訊</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>全世界有四個大「賭國」：英國人支持的直布羅陀，法國人經營的摩洛哥，葡萄牙人操縱的澳門，美國人自己主辦的雷諾。我前兩年在瑞士，還看過瑞士義大利邊境，洛迦諾對河的賭窟，當時曾深深感嘆「賭」的號召力。許多歐洲的王公，流亡政客，大財翁，都集中在那方寸之地，日以繼夜無倦色。這次在雷諾停留四天，我才知道這資本主義王國的豪賭，更為驚人。</p>
<h3>夜不閉戶　太陽永不下山</h3>
<p>銀洋一疊推得像小丘一般高，長桌，圓桌，方桌，黑壓壓的盡是擠滿着人，室內的燈光，照耀得如同白晝，花枝招展的女招待，替賭塲老闆迎接着顧客。在煙霧迷漫，人聲嘈雜的敭間中，但看見銀圓在不停地跳舞。無綫電喇叭中，一忽兒播唱著靡靡之音，一忽兒又報吿著「白角票」（彩票）開獎的號碼。成千成百的男男女女，他們把腦筋全力集中在那些號碼的勝負上，他們是那樣地感覺著新鮮，有趣和興奮。</p>
<p>雷諾是一個太陽永不「下山」的不夜之城。夜，更是雷諾人工作和歡興的時節。在最熱門的北佛傑尼亞馬路上，霓虹燈五色繽紛，照映著光滑平坦而又寬暢的馬路。賭塲的門是沒有鎖的，他們從來沒有一分鐘關閉過門戶。還有，雷諾從來沒有偷竊盜刦的案子，我問過許多當地誠樸的老百姓，他們異口同聲說：雷諾是「夜不閉戶」的一個奇特的社會。</p>
<p>遊藝場所　因離婚案發跡</p>
<p>我在「離婚城」的一篇通訊上說過：雷諾的離婚案件，必須有六星期連續的居住。六星期的時間，木算太長，但在那些飽暖無事約有閒階級，上荒漠的納伐達州來辦離婚案子，坐待六個星期，也不容易「打發」日子，雷諾的七十二家旅館，一百零一家酒吧，五十家賭塲，十五家舞廳，乃至於形形色色的遊藝塲所，大半都是寄生在「離婚」的基本法律上的。據一位雷諾的新聞同業說：今後雷諾市面的繁榮與發展，賭的重要性，逐漸在超過離婚的基本因素。因為全美國，祗有納伐達一州是沒有賭禁的，省政府不但不禁賭，而且在用全力來扶植賭業的昌隆。納伐達全省祗有十五萬人口，雷諾一城占了三萬五千。因此，美國的賭徒，四面八方雲集到雷諾來，這些人根本和離婚沒有絲毫關係，他們的興趣是賭，不是「色」。</p>
<p>賭窟統計　號稱三強六強</p>
<p>四天短短的停留中，留晚我都徘徊在賭塲，大小五十家賭窟，最大的祗有六家，雷諾人稱Big　Six（六強）；但這六家之中，祗有三家是掌握領導權的，所以又稱之為Big　Three（三強），他們都用「俱樂部」為稱號，所謂「三強」，　是皇宮俱樂部，漢洛德俱樂部和銀行俱樂部。</p>
<p>皇宮俱樂部歷史最悠久，它的廣吿上，都以「資格最老，信譽最著」作號召，據「皇宮」的老闆郝　說：皇宮俱樂部現在在中央路商業路拐角的地位，已經有五十九年，它裏邊沒有三架大輪盤賭的機器，有三架擲骰子的設備，有十四張「圈的溫」的桌子，十二張撲克方桌，以及「白角票」的大櫃台。「皇宮」有二百七十名職員，分成三班，每班每天工作八小時。單就職員薪水一項的支出來說，每年的總數是一百零七萬美元。</p>
<p>皇宮俱樂部的職員之中，有三分之一是女性，女職員的工作，多半是支配輪盤賭的機器，以及「圈的溫」把莊。她們的薪水不等，至少是每星期九十元。</p>
<h3>漢洛德賭塲老闆　是雷諾城最大的富翁</h3>
<p>目前「三強」之中最有「朝氣」的一家，是漢洛德俱樂部。許多美國東部南部的老百姓，和雷諾相隔幾千哩，也從來沒去過雷諾，但是他們都知道「漢洛德」大賭塲。原因是老闆史密斯，長於經營，而且深懂得廣吿的效力。雷諾附近的公路鐵路交通要道上，盡是「漢洛德」的廣吿，史密斯自己吿訴我：他的廣吿遍及全世界。</p>
<p>我在離開紐約前夕，認識一位波士頓的希臘籍商人哥斯考列斯。這位五十多歲的大腹賈，是雷諾的老主顧之一，他常常瞞着太太，偷偷地　雷諾去賭一二天，再偷偷地回到波士頓，因為他的介紹，我才得到機會，會見那位雷諾「賭王」史密斯。</p>
<p>史密斯在賭塲旁邊的一幢樓上接見我，那是他的賭博公司的辦公室，裏邊有秘書，有女打字員，史密斯是姓，他的名字呌「萊」，大約有五十五歲光景，年靑的時候，不務正業，在加利福尼亞一帶鬼混，慢慢地學得了許多賭的秘訣。納伐達開發以後不久，他便混到雷諾來，開設了漢洛德賭塲。現在他是雷諾城最大的富翁，但是他自己說：他不過是一名經理而已。我問他誰是「漢洛德」的眞正老闆，他回答得很妙：「我的兩個兒子，一個女兒」。</p>
<p>他把兒女的名字寫給我，長子呌史密斯漢洛德，用的賭塲的名字，次子呌史密斯萊，繼承他自己的名字，女兒呌史密斯桃樂賽。除了女兒以外，兩個兒子，都能够繼承他的衣鉢，都懂得賭的奧秘。他說：漢洛德因為節令不同，雇員也有多少，夏天多的時候，有三百職員，冬天營業額較小，大約有二百五十名職員。</p>
<h3>賭博專家　訓練賭塲職員</h3>
<p>他說：漢洛德每天的員工薪金及開銷，平均五千元，全年總數，在一百八十萬元以上，「漢洛德」現在有三十三張賭桌，五十至六十架的機器。為了要賺錢，賭博本身，便不能不有許多技巧。職員都經過「特種訓練」的，他們八小時工作完畢以後，便輪班上一二小時的課堂，訓練班有三位賭博專家，担任導師的專責。</p>
<p>提起漢洛德的歷史，史密斯相當感慨，也相當安慰，他說：當年開辦漢洛德，煞費了相當心機，最後終於在一九三五年實現。初開辦的時候，「那是怪可憐的，總共祗有兩架機器，而且是人家用過了的！」他帶着無限滄桑的情調。</p>
<p>雷諾人說：史密斯是當地社會「帮會組織」的領袖，還有人吿訴我：會見他的時候，說話要審愼一點。但我看他，倒有一副相當和善的臉孔，我問他「漢洛德」一年有多少營業額？可以贏多少錢？他露出天眞的傻笑：「這是秘密，我不能吿訴你！」</p>
<p>「但是」，他接着說：「我可以答覆你：納伐達全州，去年一年全部賭館的收入，是二千一百萬元，內中繳解給省政府的，占百分之十。賭業的全部營業額，約為贏利額的九十七倍，內　夏季占三分之二，冬季占三分之一。至於賭客的籍貫，百分之十九，是納伐達本省人，百分之八十一是各省和外國來的。外國來的約占百分之二，從首都華盛頓來的，約占百分之二。」</p>
<p>我不知道他的數字是否完全可靠，他說的時候，確是有根據的。我問他：有沒有去過摩洛哥，直面羅陀，和澳門？他說從來沒到過外國，但是他希望能够有一個「出洋考察」的機會。</p>
<h3>賭法種種　圈的溫·輪盤賭</h3>
<p>說到這裏，我應該介紹一下：雷諾的賭的種類，最普遍的是「圈的溫」，二張撲克牌，以二十點為最大。其次是三十六門的輪盤賭，跟中國的「壓寳」一樣，壓中了，一個可以贏三十五，但同時也可以壓三門，四門，五門，乃至於十二門。再其次，便是擲骰子，這和中國的骰子，完全異　，它是一個木製的　　形的桌子，大如一艘捕魚的小船，賭徒門圍船而立，桌面上繪着各種像輪盤賭一樣的方格，賭客把錢，按你的運氣，壓在不同的方格之中。賭塲的雇員是「莊家」，莊家有兩個人，手執像高爾夫球棒那樣的棍棒，大聲呌喊骰子的點數。擲骰子的人是賭客輪流担任，按照圍立的次序投擲。「莊家」不動手擲骰子，表示他們沒有弊端，但只看見他們兩根棍棒，不住的一局局鈎取銀洋。有時候，也有賭客贏的，但那祗是少數。</p>
<p>粵籍華僑愛玩「白角票」</p>
<p>我旁觀了兩晚，還是不明白其中決勝的規則，只看見兩顆：有點笨相的大骰子，不停的在跳動，美國人，特別是退伍歸來的海陸軍人，都相當的歡喜用骰子取賭。骰子桌上的「生意」，也最為興隆。此外，彩票（白角票）也相當熱鬧，中國廣東籍的華僑，去雷諾賭的，最有興趣於「白角票」。</p>
<p>白角票和上海的所謂彩票不同，中國彩票，半個月一個月才開獎一次，白角票，一夜可以開彩四五十次，它的英文名字呌Race　Horse　Keno，實際上，跟「跑馬」又風馬牛不相及。它祗是一張畫有八十個方格的小紙，賭客在八十格之中，用墨筆任意點取十格，賭金由一角錢起，到五千元至，任便你自由繳款。賭館每隔二十分鐘開獎一次，每次開二十個號碼，如果你選取的十個號碼之中，有五個和他所開的相合，便可以得一倍的獎金，有六個或七個相合，可以得數十倍的獎金。如果十個全相合，五角錢一張的彩票，可以贏到二千多元。</p>
<p>因為引誘力有這樣大，賭「白角票」的人特別多，看似容易，實際複雜。高等代數裏的「或然率」，不難算出得獎的可能，竟有千百份之幾？我因為好奇，也試買了十多次，祗有一次中了五個數字，一角錢贏了兩角錢。</p>
<p>最主要的一點，是；每種賭博，賭的對手是賭塲主人，賭塲主人用雇員，代替他執行。賭客與賭客之間沒有賭博，這是雷諾賭的原則，他們的職員，都穿白色的極講究的制服，說話非常和藹而有禮貌，在任何塲合，他們決不和顧客爭吵。全世界的賭客，到這兒來輸了錢，特別是那些離婚約有閒階級，他們的情緒，免不了惡劣，把六星期的光陰，消磨在賭塲裏，雖然明知是「送錢」，但因為那些職員們和藹溫文，顧客的精神上，永遠是愉快的。</p>
<p>黃金季節　夏天賭客增多</p>
<p>「一夏喫三冬」，夏天是納伐達的黃金的季節，我到雷諾的時候，剛好是冬天，冬天，賭客們不太踴躍，我料定許多桌子邊上，坐着不少假裝的顧客，實際，他們都是「便衣」的賭塲職員。</p>
<p>比較最文雅的賭博是「平戈」，像下圍棋一樣，許多人圍坐着大圓桌玩，主人用摸彩的方法，摸唱各種不同的數目字，賭客用黑棋子放在數字上，誰先把一條直綫塡滿了，誰就是得獎者，每局「平戈」的繳費，從五分錢至二角五分不等，得獎的獎金，從六塊錢到一百元也不等。「平戈」賭塲是獨立的，不在大賭塲之內。我看見許多美國老太太，玩「平戈」消磨一整天。</p>
<p>普遍賭具　「喫角子老虎」</p>
<p>除了這些以外，還有一種極普遍的，深入到每一個納伐達農村的賭具，它的名字呌Jack　Pot，直譯起來，應該是「手拉賭博機器」（喫角子老虎），上自號稱三強的大賭塲，下至農村雜貨店，咖啡鋪，餐廳，公共汽車站，飛機塲，幾乎到處都有。它的長處是無須主人來管，客人高興，投一個五分錢的　幣進去，再用手在旁邊「開關」上一拉，機器裏的輪盤，就自動滾轉，如果得獎，它便會自動掉下三個五個乃至十個二十個　幣來。如果不得獎，則一個　幣的血本，便普查機器喫去。</p>
<p>機器怎樣構造，是一個秘密，大槪平均每拉若干次，總不會使賭客太失望，但如果久而久之玩下去，客人一定會弄到全部輸光。據說，發明的人，現在是美國有數的大富翁之一。每年納伐達全省的賭塲，雜貨店，咖啡館，靠「手拉機器」賺的總數，很為可觀，機器有五分錢拉一次的，也有一角一次的和五角一次的三種，雖然賭額不算大，但積少甚多，也就不可等閒視之了。</p>
<p>我問過賭王史密斯，關於機器的發明與製造，他說：誰發明機器？他也不知道。不過，機器是芝加哥造的，廠的名字呌「潘司」，在芝加哥的印第安愛文義路。機器從芝加哥大量運到納伐達來，分為兩種交易，大俱樂部是乾脆向他買的；小雜貨店是向廠家租借的，租金的多寡不等，甚至有的到每年五六千元。</p>
<p>史密斯接着還說：可惜的是美國祗有納伐達一省開放賭禁，不然，那家公司還要發大財！</p>
<p>發大財，發大財，君不見雷諾城內，萬千銀洋在打轉！在這看不見鈔票的賭塲上，鏗鏘的銀圓飛舞聲，宏亮的數字摸彩聲，賭客們的慨嘆呌鬧聲，揉混在一起。人們像浪潮一樣，湧進湧出，俱樂部門前的各式各型的汽車，永遠像流水一般，來往不息。這些人似乎沒有煩惱，沒有憂愁，沒有悲哀和惆悵。誰說納伐達的荒漠像地獄？誰不相信「賭城」雷諾，正象徵着人間天堂？（於納伐達州）</p>

<p>學校軍訓請勿停止</p>
<p>高中以上學校之有軍事訓練，乃我最高當局要紏正文武殊途與全體國民重文輕武的習尚，藉以振衰起敝，爭取民族生存，首先試辦於浙蘇皖區的各學校裏，以後由於政府的積極提倡，和敎育當局的紛紛響應，到二十四五年的時候，更是蔚然成風，凡有血性的靑年，莫不以文武合一，術德兼修為無上的光榮。蘆溝橋的砲聲，吿訴了他們的報國機會，無論在前綫或後方，抬傷兵煮茶飯，以及打回老家去的行列裏，都有了他們的踪跡。尤其是主席提倡的知識靑年從軍運動，他們更慷慨激昂，義無反顧的踴躍響應了！十萬靑年十萬軍的偉大號召，誰說不是學校軍訓成績的具體表現呢？我們檢討這十餘年來的軍訓歷史，如果從技術方面講，因為人力物力財力的不够，距離我們理想的目標相去尚遠，如果從生活方面，思想方面講，他的成功，確是不能抹煞的。兵書上說：「平時生活與戰時生活一致者存，相反者亡」；總理也昭示過我們：「由思想發生信仰，由信仰發生力量」。戰時靑年的能够刻苦耐勞，團結奮鬥，在一個政府，一個主義，一個領袖之領導下，羣策羣力，勇往邁進，這決不是偶然的！假如我們把軍事訓練，分為技術訓練，生活訓練，和思想訓練三個部門，他的成敗得失，自可不言而喻了。我們決不能因噎廢食，對我們的基本國策，也發生了懷疑，我們應該在設備方面，組織方面，和人事方面去力求改善，使他確確實實能够發揮掌握指揮訓練管理的最大功能，從整飭學風上，來奠定靑年們立己人立德立功的堅強基礎。幷且以集中訓練，來補助學校訓練之不足，那麼，今後的成就，當更相得益彰了。如果停止了學校軍事訓練，僅僅在高中畢業後，給以一年的集中訓練，姑無論這種訓練是不是能够普及於每個知識靑年，縱使他們都能參加這種訓練，也可以說是舍本逐末，根本失去了寓軍於學的意義了！諺云：「學校是國家的縮影」，有了健全的學校，纔能造就健全的人才，有了健全的人才，纔能建設強盛的國家，我們要使全國靑年，都能够為國家民族效忠，擔當得起繼往開來，建國復興的艱鉅使命，一定要把軍事與敎育，密切配合，而後軍事纔能發揮其效能，敎育纔能得到預期的成果。在這　　逼處，科學萬能的時候，軍事如果離開了敎育，就等於失去了靈魂；敎育如果離開了軍事，就等於沒有了骨幹。歐美各國，有在小學裏面就增設軍事訓練了，而我們僅僅在高中以上學校，纔有軍事訓練，相形之下，已覺得不够普及了。我們要建國，我們要復興，我們要保持八年來艱苦奮鬥，換來的光榮成果，我們的學校軍事訓練，不但不能停止，而且要力求其普及與改善。（蜀岳）</p>
<p>退還進修費應實施</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>閱報載「市立學校敎職員學術進修費已由市參議會列入預算，已向學生徵收各校着令退還。」具見參議員諸公關懷民　，减輕各家長之負担，無任欽感。惟目下仍有一部份市校仍向各生催收是項進修費，已繳者退還無期，為家長者當然不便前往索取。恐傷感情，如是則市校仍可陽奉陰違，霸不發還，擬請敎育局迅即令飭各校將已收之「敎職員學術進修費」尅日發還，以重輿情。（王人則）</p>

<h3>觀書畫記</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>中州張伯駒先生工詞知音，尤精鑒識。其所藏收法書名畫炬赫海內已久。陸士衡平復帖眞蹟，遠在　　以前其尤著者也。僕忻慕其人，未得識面。日者友人謝稚柳先生，偕伯駒與沈尹默監察見過，邀往觀其近所携來之品。僕大喜過望。次日復約與伯駒相見，又得觀數卷。忽促之間，烟雲過眼。略疏所能憶及者，以爲談助云。</p>
<p>一　范仲淹小楷道服贊眞跡　范文正此書爲海內劇蹟。已刻三希堂帖中。原件爲孺子儀携至東省，倭降省，儀爲錄軍所俘。此書與他珍蹟復出。觀其裝池，仍乾隆之舊。外裏錦袱淺碧地白章。袱內肝爲白綾。綾上　鳥絲雙闌長矩形，的三寸。形內墨書三行記范仲淹道服贊及臣張照校次等字。至道服贊則裝爲卷子。其外白玉籤內刻隸書「乾隆御賞」及「范仲淹道服贊」等字。范公此書蕭曠和靜多用分筆。其起落轉換處行筆之迹一一可尋。尹默云，「其放筆極遠，而收筆甚緊」於其後山谷跋中所稱得古法之語，歎爲知言。僕允喜文與可及吳匏　二跋。總之不見眞蹟不知三希堂所刻之失。此眞希世之　墨也。</p>
<p>二　黃魯直草書長卷此　亦淸宮舊藏。玉籤形式與道服贊所有者相同。惟無錦袱。想已佚矣。山谷此書全師懷素自叙，而不襲其跡。其自所跋尾亦殊自負。</p>
<p>三　米海岳十帖眞跡卷子　米書十帖皆零落之稿，首尾不全。其前二帖極精工。在風檣陣馬之中，而有法度森嚴之感。其餘者筆意與前微異。沈尹翁以爲恐是吳琚書亂入者。此極有見。然無害其爲佳書耳。</p>
<p>四　紫雲小像卷子　此陳其年爲僮九靑所作在海內極負重名。淸初名家題詠殆徧。卷中紫雲貌甚豐腴，眉目秀絕。惜無人據藹理斯及茀羅乙德之心理學爲文題之者。思之正復忍俊不禁也。</p>
<p>五　明末四姬花卉卷子　明末四姬吳娟娟，馬湘蘭，林雪，王××，（失記）爲王伯榖所繪卷子。吳畫水仙，馬晝蕙，林畫菊，王畫臘梅。蓋所謂春夏秋冬四景也。其前爲四姬聯句題詩而湘闌書之。其後有伯榖書跋題曰尊生居士。</p>
<p>六　棟亭圖卷子　此圖繪者甚多自惲壽平，禹之鼎，以次凡數家。人各一幅。淸初名公題者幾乎備矣。允西堂一家即兩題一爲詩一爲賦。納蘭容若與顧梁汾同用韵題詞二闋，而容若書之。分裝爲四卷。亦鉅觀也。此爲研討紅樓夢作者之絕妙資料。不知胡君適之今日旣爲「過河卒子」尙有此閑情逸致否耳。</p>
<p>七　董其昌山水小卷　此亦淸宮舊藏，有高宗題識記其曾臨仿之歲月。文敏自題遠山須見高低乃得勢，叢樹須見俯仰乃有情常拈此辭而悟者甚少云云。則其得意筆也。後合裝另一紙則文敏所書左太冲諸人之詩。作寸內行楷甚　。</p>
<p>八　趙孟頫蘭倪璣行合裝卷　此成親王舊藏。其題簽尙是成邸手蹟。兩幅皆不大，且非精心結撰。然隨意揮灑轉見天機流露。松雪之蘭似尤有當風之　。</p>
<p>九　元人五家集錦卷　此卷甚大，五家名姓已不復詳憶。惟憶有王寃梅花一枝耳。五紙皆墨筆，皆精。其中有一幅鈴沈石田收藏印。僕於沈氏鑑賞印記，此爲初見。</p>
<p>十　趙孟堅詩畫長卷　此南海伍儷荃舊物。卷首題籲爲儷荃手蹟。前有一輻甚小，畫水仙數莖。後爲子固自書詩十餘章，作行草。其詩勃鬱於忠愛之情，談笑於窮通之際，磊落　奇自成家數。詩後有隸書一跋，引白香山以自喻。僕觀其詩，體製與香山不同，視香山亦無愧色。其　則亦厚重亦倜儻，在蔡君謨米襄陽之間。其結體氣息，悉是宋賢。非若松雪之已開元人風氣者也。松雪之書，誠極盡天姿學力，能以古爲新矣。子固此書縱不能謂爲松雪所不及，然亦決非松雪之所能度越也。允可貴者滿紙奇縱之氣，而一出於古法。若以此論之，直云超過松雪可矣。伍氏曾鉤摹此卷，刻之海山仙館帖中。今眞蹟上尙可見，　摹時不愼，所遺之　痕。鳴呼，子固松雪，兄弟二難，不容軒輊。至若遺浮世之榮，立人倫之矩，所謂振衣千仞濯足萬里則子固去人遠矣！（三月十一日燈下追記）</p>
<h3>評趙桐蔭畫</h3>
<p>— 白雨主</p>
<p>山水畫中頗見其所長，則以趙君素　國畫，而在八年抗戰期間，漫遊西南北各省，故其所　絕非從古人畫本中臨摹得來，而悉取自然對象，足跡所至即筆墨所至也。</p>
<p>且窮險之處，興之所至，亦無不躡登。終南山中及翠筆峯，　應台諸輻，並取眞景；尤以終南山中一輻，爲淡遠有致。</p>
<p>劍門關，西秦第一關，褒城石門等輻，並爲棧道風景，而劍門一輻烟雲繚繞，令人想像，放翁細雨騎　之句，更饒詩意。</p>
<p>川西灌縣玉壘關，象鼻石等幅，或見其險，或見其奇，而靑城常道觀瀑布，及洗心亭等幅，則略似東南風景，惟上天梯一幅，則　勢逈異，非親歷其險者不能寫也。</p>
<p>華山諸輻，以靑柯坪，玉女峯，蒼龍嶺數幀爲佳，而蒼龍嶺山道陡絕之處，壁立千仞，純爲寫生之筆，亦別具作風，信如題詞所謂「兩崖鐵索萬丈苦藤」也。</p>
<p>其他如花卉作品，爲梅菊牡丹紫藤之類，本屬趙君素擅，然方諸山永畫意，則反似尋常家數矣。山水小幅中亦有數輻，如湖口春色，白雲出岫，均淸麗可取。</p>
<h3>關於許疑盦</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>梁烈亞先生「紀漸江的畫」一文，稱許疑盦先生爲當代文豪，與　太炎張季直諸公交好云云。疑盦先生，不求聞達，知者寥寥。就余所知，疑翁雖治經學，似未爲太炎之敵。惟詩力之深，海內無與倫比。而知其詩者，亦不普遍，因撰此文，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>疑　氏許，　承堯，一字　叟，歙縣西鄉唐模村人。光緒甲午舉人，甲辰翰林，民國後，五度入隴，迭任甘肅督軍省長公署政務廳長及某道道尹。五十歸里，閉門讀書，不再出任。去春以病歿於鄕，享壽七十有三，優遊林下，已享淸福二十年矣。</p>
<p>疑翁五十三歲時，自决其所爲詩，梓爲六卷。今流傳絕尠。其自序略云：</p>
<p>余爲詩，初愛李賀，溫處筠，繼乃由韓愈溯杜甫，間窺陶潛阮籍，於宋亦取陳與義，梅堯臣，無偏嗜故無偏肖。因時變遷，惟意所適，取足宣吾情，自娛悅耳。鄭子尹言頗不思存稿，其如勞者歌？余亦勞者歌也。生平哀樂，略見於是，不忍捐棄，獨恨無點定吾詩者……疑翁丁卯至辛未間所爲詩，由其友汪劍平付印，分二卷。首冠劍平序文。於疑翁個性，及其詩之佳處，論列鎮確。茲摘抄如次：</p>
<p>先生詩初學昌黎，五言古體，能肖其神。晚年居黃山，漸即蕭淡。故發爲詩歌，彌復閒適，然於淡遠之中，時有　元之致，神采　崿，幾使人手不可捫。顧即而與語，則又吃吃不能劇談，溢粹安雅，藹然古君子也。……癸丑甲寅，西陲略定，先生以求米故，傭筆於此。時歷城林棠，吳縣黃希憲，工爲樂府，競爽荒裔，先生思力絕人，林黃輩不敢抗手。每當梨雲繞郭，賭唱提壺，春游之雅，實窮荒未有之勝也。先生旣爲襜帷揖客，一時曳裾之士，執賢以請謁者，比比也。先生圭角雖斂，未嘗以崖岸示人，而涇渭斄然，不稍假借，其始終不渝肝胆，炯然相照者，惟吾及林棠耳。……</p>
<p>疑翁五度入隴，集中寫隴中風物，精力彌滿，自足爲邊城壯采。辛亥前王樹枬，兪明震，陳詩，亦曾觴詠其間。但皆只能爲小詩，不足與疑翁相提並論也。</p>
<p>疑翁廿載鄕居，寫新安山水，自是不同凡響。而描摹黃山松石之奇，尤爲出色，劉龍　先生謂自有黃山以來，題詩者無慮千百家，未有能及疑翁者。其推重可想見矣。疑翁黃山詩，前後數十篇，無一不佳。如「發慈光寺至文殊院」四首之一云：</p>
<p>徑無五步直，必臨一面虛。枯壁凸其腹，逼人無委紓。緣梯認履迹，鋻石寸容趺。低首禁他矚，縋攀上徐徐。壁頂忽橫跨，窘仄三寸餘。天風陡激盪，雲影深模胡。更上路竟絕，崖　萬石扶。奔泉　荒脊，爭此猿猱途。</p>
<p>距慈光寺五里許，名五里欄，絕壁橫行，最爲艱險。其上爲倒破紋，因亂石爲徑，浮沙滑足。此詩寫登陟之苦，妙到毫　。又「文殊院」四首之一云：</p>
<p>雄風破空來，驅雲蹋天走。驚濤悸心目，奔石落肩肘。羣峰易其次，倏忽分見吾。見如舟出峽，一閃復無有。掉頭偶不虞，雲氣咽滿口。老松與風戰，如人競張手。百撑不一折，頗恃鱗甲厚。山靈顧憐之，　　不使久，吾徒飯未畢，旭日已窺　。</p>
<p>此詩寫黃山松雲，幻變多端有生龍活虎之妙。「登清凉臺」云</p>
<p>振衣淸凉臺，百怪始入目。峭壁聳孤縣，俯見萬峰伏。一松依一石，棱棱若雕鏤。松乃肖石形，石亦似松族。離奇不可名，鮮秀出新沐。隨肩互參差，摩頂各莊肅。如聚萬蛟璃，幽之於一谷。吾今撫有之，戲以兒孫畜。一笑識黃山，不負　吾足。</p>
<p>黃山包羅萬象，無奇不有，惟奇松怪石，乃爲特色。疑翁此詩，寫松石之奇，令人歎觀止矣。</p>
<p>疑翁之喪，誠詩壇之大損失。陳弢庵先生（寳琛）最賞其詩，以爲數百年中，罕有此才。不僅並時諸子不能抗衡已也。閩縣老詩人何梅生先生，於弢老處見疑翁詩，五體投地。一日，於斗室中踱步，口中朗誦：「凉心如髮，微逗一蟬知」二句，津津然若有無窮之味，其弟子某君怪而問之，梅生曰「此疑　先生句也近於弢老許處見之。此眞足與古人媲美，非今詩人所能及也」。弢庵梅生，於近人詩，少所許可，今於疑翁推重如此，具見疑翁工力之深，絕非一二人阿私所好耳。</p>
<h3>藝術品的欣賞</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>藝術品的欣賞，不是一件容易的事情，中國具有五千年文明，表現最高意境情感之和人格的純藝術，要算書法。我們可以從　體來劉分歷史的時期，像歐洲依據建築風格的變遷，來劃分時代一樣。中國　畫，是集合詩書畫，　成一爐，以構成特殊的意境，與歐洲建築雕刻　畫三位一體的旨趣不同。淸乾隆時，供奉內廷的意大利畫家米　人郎世寗（Gastigrion）以西畫寫生的方法，應用於中國素絹上，注重渲染與鈎勒，而缺乏生動的筆意與墨趣，以較近代大家陳老　·禹之鼎·任伯年輩，藝術品的價値，極有軒輊。原因很簡單，郎氏不通曉中國的書法，爲其重要的因素。</p>
<p>淸畫家鄒一桂，批評西畫說：「西洋善勾股法，故其繪畫於陰陽遠近，不差錙黍，所畫人物屋樹，皆有日影；其所用顏色與筆，與中華絕異布影與闊而狹，以三角量之，畫宮室於牆壁，令人幾欲走進。但筆法全無，雖工亦匠，故不入畫品。」鄒氏拿「筆法全無，雖工亦匠」，作批評西畫的根據，常然是一種不合理的偏見。可惜他沒見過安格爾（Ingers）的素描，魯本斯，咸奈斯克滋·　勃朗機·哥牙。和據奈克瓦的傑作，西畫甸　不　究　　和筆觸，這是中國畫人，不會欣賞西方藝術的根本錯誤。</p>
<p>中國繪畫在魏晋六朝時期，所形成的宗敎藝術，與歐洲古意大利　畫，採取的題材與技術，有不謀而合的趨勢，挂因中國書法大昌，詩學發達，與畫法互相溝通，以形成特殊的風格，西洋繪畫，受了十五世紀文藝復興和科學進步影響，致力於光影明暗的研究，其結果與中國　　大異其旨趣。但是各有各的特長和價値。</p>
<p>藝術品的收藏和欣賞，向來屬於特殊階級所享受的權利，民間很少接觸的機會，又無美術館和博物館的設立，弄得僞造與模仿品，大量流行。前代作家，以供奉內廷，爲帝室　養，認爲無上光榮，喪失了自我創造的精神，被客觀條件支配而製作。形成千篇一律的院體。</p>
<p>近年以來，作家個人的展覽，如雨後春笋，風行一時；除少數成功作品外，有重量不重質的趨勢，减低作家高尙的情操，走上功利主義的途徑，結果在藝術本身的欣賞和創作上，發生了問題。我們應該及早挽救這種危機，以矯正以往錯誤的觀念。</p>
<h3>況又韓敎授畫枯木竹歌</h3>
<p>— 陳蒙庵</p>
<p>坡公好寫木與石，其趣得諸書與詩；眞跡於今能幾見，遣法想象倘可追。木枯政爾有生意，石可轉也終不移；輪　鬱勃氣磊落，獨假墨君相發揮；興酣紙盡畫亦就，旁觀不屑羣兒嗤。後來　史競　倣，以　爲之無乃癡；昨夜高亭張燈燭，髣　後山覓句時；嗟君此畫仍是畫，劣得詩法具體微；昂須我友友須我，相視莫逆大宗師；髯若有知應大笑，誇誕虛　徒費詞；區區小技何足道，不如拉雜摧燒之。</p>
<h3>黃山圖序</h3>
<p>— 神駒</p>
<p>爲畫家朱其石作</p>
<p>昔人有言曰：古今畫家無論軒冕岩穴，其人之品質必高。昔李思訓爲唐宗室，武后朝遂解組歸隱，以筆墨自適。盧鴻一至開元中，屢徴不起，營草堂居之。宋李成，系出長安，游藝不仕。元吳仲圭抗簡孤潔，誅　爲梅花　，　漁父圖，　漁父詞，爲後人傳誦。倪雲林造淸秘閣獨居，寫平林遠岫自怡；黃公望三日斷炊，猶袒腹豆棚下悠然自得，圖寫處山。八大山人淸湘陳人與漸江僧，或以宗室遯世，或以高僧隱逸，寄情於丹靑；皆志節高邁，放達不覊。故其所作皆入神品，塵容俗狀，不得犯其豪端。社友嘉興朱其石，幼年侍宦游浙東，因以括蒼山民爲號，品性傲岸，於藝事無所不能；其刻印融皖浙於一鑪，書法秦金漢石；畫山水則師迭化，不拘泥於繩墨，可謂俱入神品之列。迨卜居南湖，寢　藝事，矢志靡他，益趨神化。抗戰軍興，避寇天目；旣而重登黃山，搜遍三十六峰之勝，盡入畫囊。朅來海上，杜門治藝，於是五日一水，十日一山，杜少陵之所謂王宰眞蹟，孰意於今日觀之。朱子旣兩度探黃海之勝，歸而夢繞魂繫，與客談，談天都峰之險峻，爲人畫，畫蓮花峰之秀拔；其腕底不啻有山靈爲之神助，落紙雲烟，變幻莫測。至於氣韵之流動，筆墨之蒼古，猶其餘事。知予酷嗜其所寫紀遊諸作，乃招予過其寓邸，出示若干輻，或華滋，或荒寒，或崔嵬，或秀峭，對之如身入天都蓮花間，悠然見雲海盪漾，幾忘其在十丈軟紅中也。朱子曰：黃山圖豈僅此，今先嘗鼎一臠；其他縱者，橫者，尋丈者，盈尺者，都五十餘幅，即日陳列寗波同鄉會畫廳；並其友人秦翰方許大盧兩詩人，獲自長春之僞滿史料共數百點，以供展覽；屆時君允宜作半日之壁上觀可也。舉行之日，爲序小言贈之。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血199</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「哈！」米子也學着　見的混混口氣，「那麼對誰負責？是不是對您自己負責？」這個口氣，簡直不客氣得很。</p>
<p>「很可以這麼說！」鶴見還是沉着氣，「因鄙人是受命於參謀總部，參謀本部，和近衛閣下的。只要鄙人能對這兩個機關和近衛總座負責，大槪很够了，別的人方面，大槪問不着吧！」</p>
<p>「這麼說罷，井上隊長」，萍子始終那麼溫和，「這裏由我負責罷，隊長可以根據我這話，回貴部去報吿罷。」</p>
<p>「評…砰砰砰…砰！」信號第二次發出了，聽這槍聲，大概我們這邊的隊伍，距離很近了。這次信號一放，陡然聽得四而八方，同時都有信號槍聲。這信號槍聲未完，立時各色槍聲並起，步槍，手提機，和門外架着的機槍，同時大作。兩面已經正式接觸了。</p>
<p>「嘿…！」虎城不知發見了什麼，忽地輕輕這麼喊了一聲。</p>
<p>我剛想向虎城探問，已經來不及了，只見大　電燈，忽然一齋熄滅。門內人聲，門外槍聲，相互喧騰，眞如鼎沸，亂轟轟地。眼前又是黑漆一片，別說「伸手不見五指」，速手也不見。我站在這裏，就如同一時失足，墮入了深淵一般。</p>
<p>「耀羣小姐！…虎城！…」我連連喊了幾聲，並無回答。</p>
<p>同時却聽到人聲槍聲喧　，步聲雜沓之外，那個冒牌的雌老虎，大聲叱吼着，像狼嗥一樣。吼聲漸去漸遠，想是邊吼邊往外跑，吼些什麼，也聽不眞。</p>
<p>剛想摸索探步向前，去找鶴見，忽地一道强烈的光華，從大　屋角裏發射出來，像探照燈一般，橫掃過來，掃到我身邊，立時停住，忽而熄了。</p>
<p>「秘書長！」一個粗壯的嗓音，從不遠的地方喊着。</p>
<p>一聽這聲音和那半山東半日本的腔調，就知道是「〇四」。</p>
<p>「秘書長，…都走光哪！…」聽這說話的聲音，知道「〇四」正向我這裏走過來了。</p>
<p>「都出去參加了？」，我對準「〇四」的方向問他。</p>
<p>「說不上…有的上樓，有的衝到大門外出了。」</p>
<p>「瞧見咱們隊長嗎？」我第一個躭心鶴見，因他的處境太特出，太複雜；「還有那一位萍子小姐？」</p>
<p>「上樓去哪，」大傻子這們答着。</p>
<p>「小姐…耀羣小姐和虎臣呢？」</p>
<p>「也上樓去了。」</p>
<p>「他們的隊長和兩位客人呢？」這是指着w君戴先生和馬秘書。</p>
<p>「大槪也是上樓去了。」</p>
<p>我得到這些報吿，知這他們都上樓去了，我一人當然沒有站在這裏的必要。門外正是火綫，大槪流彈正亂飛着，我也沒有出去的必要；並且眼睛近視，不一定看得見什麼。我決定也上樓去。</p>

<p>現在每一個人對於現狀都表示不滿，提起什麼事都是搖頭，都表示沒有辦法，表示灰心，好像眼前看到的只是添黑的一團。</p>
<p>比如金潮案的澈查，直到十四日爲止，才透露出參加金潮舞弊的，又是一套「官商勾結」的老戲法。</p>
<p>以前米糧貸款，因爲官商勾結閙得滿城風雨，而現在使上海物價騰貴百分之一百的金潮案，却又是「官商勾結」在作怪！</p>
<p>林鳳苞。楊安仁·都是官辦銀行中間的要員，他們利用職權的關係，暗中拋售金條，收購金條，一方面操縱金融的生殺大權，一方面假借職權的空隙，擾亂金融。正如警備部楊副司令所稱，林楊二人，與商人表裏呼應，私相授受，利用外圍組織，操縱黃金，與奸商一鼻孔出氣，而上下其手。</p>
<p>現在上海市金業公會理事長詹蓮生已予逮捕而林楊二人尙在保釋之中。金潮案現經最高當局主張嚴辦，我們也希望林楊二人，應該即送司法當局從嚴處置。</p>
<p>美國新聞記者對中國的記載，往往痛詆中國的官僚政治，官僚資本，官商勾結；而嚴懲金潮案中的舞弊份子，也正足以一洗國際間對中國政治現狀的耳目！</p>
<p>你看：合衆社不是又再嚴詞指責官僚資本在中國商行佔有特權的批評麼？</p>
<p>中國有句俗語，說是：「只要坐得正，那怕和尙尼姑合板凳！」</p>
<p>人家指責我們官僚政治也好，官僚資本也好，只要最高當局嚴正不阿，依法懲治幾個「亦官亦商」「非官非商」如林鳳苞。楊安仁之流，不單國際友人謠諑可以平息，就是民間的怨懟，也得以抑止。</p>
<p>千頭萬緒的中國政治，總結不過在此一端，我們應從速確立法洽，不以人爲中心，而使大權獨攬的人物，任意爲非作歹！</p>
<p>金潮案中官方要員參加舞弊，即是一個顯著的例子。</p>

<h3>達爾文猜對了　珊瑚礁是陸沉島嶼</h3>
<p>— 嚴桐</p>
<p>科學進展有時竟出奇地慢！達爾文在一百十年前有個學說，直至今朝方才被美國海軍證實。</p>
<p>話說一八三一年，達爾文那時還不過是位年輕的博物學家，駕了比格爾號船作那著名的航行。當他橫渡南太平洋的時候，看環狀的珊瑚島，看得出神，他很詫異：在如此深的海洋上，怎會陡聳地長出些茶杯托形的珊瑚。爲什麼成爲環狀？怎樣形成的？大家知道珊瑚在水面以下數　（一　等於六呎）的地方就不大茂盛了，那末這珊瑚礁決非從海底長上來的。於是達爾文下結論道：珊瑚礁起因於島嶼之陸沉，陸沉之後，長在岸邊的珊瑚依然生長，就形成了現在的環礁。</p>
<p>此說頗爲人採納，可是一直沒有證明，直到去年美國海軍決定在比基尼島試騐兩顆原子彈的時候方始被證實。科學家用地震法測繪環確的結構。用一百二十六處深水炸藥在環礁底部各處爆炸。爆炸之時，音波穿過珊瑚及其以下物質，凡物質愈堅實，則音波穿過愈快，紀錄各測音儀器收到音波的先後，科學家就能估計岩石每階段的密度。</p>
<p>他們發現水面二千呎以上，珊瑚礁由珊瑚或其類似物質構成。以下是一片較硬的岩石，可能是從前火山噴出來的灰燼，或者是珊瑚或他種海產動物的石灰岩被緊壓而成的東西。至五千呎左右，他們要找的東西畢竟來了，這是一個掩埋着的山。</p>
<p>這可能是火山的中心，侵蝕的遺跡。底細如何祗有鑽鑿法才能知道。不過無論如何，山總在那兒，遠在珊瑚生長地之下。達爾文在帆船甲板上猜對了。（譯自一月十三日時代雜誌）</p>

<h3>拼老命</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>現社會裏，雖有「兼職不兼薪」這一項各目，但實際上是否存在，却不得而知。</p>
<p>據我耳濡目染，心領神會之所得，我敢斗胆說一句：最大多數的人們，正是爲了「兼薪」，才去「兼職」的。因爲只有兼職，才可以日出而作，日入而仍不息，從此，仰事俯蓄，才可吿無愧。</p>
<p>一位做「夜生活」的朋友，從本學期起，開始兼職去了，在白天喪當了某大學的一名敎授。他慣於說實話，「我的跌進大學校的門，坐冷板櫈，只是爲了希望領到一些日用配給品，否則，怎麼也不高興拼老命！」</p>
<p>「拼老命！」這是一句悽厲的哀鳴！他的負担　　重，他在生命的危崖上發抖的情勢，也不難想像得到了。他　知道自己學力有餘，體力或許已感不支，但他不得不「跌進」，像牛馬一樣，日夜兼勤；他也明明知道，再過幾年，恐怕連堅强　　肉也將不再存在，連出汗出力的掙扎的資本也找不到了，再遲下去，則連「跳出」的氣力也不可復得了。他必須及時地「跌進」，其他一切便也管不了許多了！可是，拼了老命以後，誰又能配給他以生命呢？這是他在生命之前戰慄的原故。</p>
<p>哲學家尼朱說：人類無異是金髮的野獸，文學家毛亨姆指出中國人（指苦力）彷彿是負着重載的牲口，在人生的行程或探險中，我想，每個人或遲或早必然要「跌進」一個地方去，至於跌進什麼地方？我想，不外是一個坑。</p>
<p>這天，朋友的我前去看「八千里路雲和月」，可怕的是：坑的影子不的而同地印入了我們的心坎。不管自己在人生舞台上是否高出劇中主角，但彼此與坑的距離，則同樣是已極接近了。等到影戲終塲，他慨然長歎了一聲：行八千里路，却發見了一個坑！</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>老祝終於也發覺有人在注視自己，便打斷了說話，轉過臉去。</p>
<p>「啊！是你？」他可不能像那位少婦一樣的沉着。對方的面貌才映進他的眼簾，他已一躍而起，瞪圓了一雙大眼，失聲驚呼着。</p>
<p>「是我，不錯。兆年。」少婦輕輕地回答。</p>
<p>徐胖子斜睨了他們一眼。</p>
<p>「老祝，你們向來相識嗎？這位是我的表嫂，才從上海來，恰好碰到逃難。」主人像介紹似的說。</p>
<p>兩個客人都不　　。</p>
<p>那少婦故意轉個身，走向窗前去，坐在一張小木椅上，勉强很不自然地笑了一笑，用以打開這一個僵局。</p>
<p>「噢！你們是親戚」祝兆年惘然地說：「昨天來我還沒有看見。」</p>
<p>「他們是昨天晚上到的。眞虧你，表嫂！」徐紹明很歡迎有這一個插曲，意外地打斷了老祝的牢騷。「他們繞了好多路，是打坪石那邊來的。老祝，我表嫂眞能够，還帶着兩個孩子咧！」</p>
<p>「兩個孩子？　，你已有了孩子了？」祝兆年慘然地問，一時忘了顧忌。</p>
<p>「整整的十一年了！怎么沒有孩子？」闌很快的回答，不讓徐紹明有注意老祝所用的那個親熱的稱謂的機會。</p>
<p>徐紹明牛飲似的喝完了他面前擱的一杯冷茶。</p>
<p>「二表嫂，你是怎麼和老祝認識的？」他顯得困惑地問。</p>
<p>「我們是在辦靑年劇團的時候認識。」祝兆年代替那少婦答覆了這個問題。</p>
<p>「噢！不錯，不錯！你在學校裏的時候，女朋友就多得很！」徐紹明略略想起了一些。可是他和老祝雖然在一起念書，志趣却完全不同，平日很少往還，所以詳」細的情形並不知道。</p>
<p>「你爲什麼在這個時候才進來，偏又帶着孩子？」老祝再要嬉皮笑臉也不能了。「你還打算住在桂林嗎？你的先生呢？」</p>
<p>那少婦用一條小手帕緩緩地拂拭着鼻尖上的汗珠，沒有就答覆；她的情緒也起了極大的激盪。（十五）</p>

<h3>President Chiang's Address</h3>
<p>Key points of President Chiang's address at the opening of the Third Plenary Session: (1) The Second Plenary Session convened the National Assembly, fulfilling the resolution to end political tutelage and return power to the people, which is gratifying. (2) Peaceful construction has been frustrated by the deliberate rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, which is deeply distressing. (3) This plenary session should conduct a detailed review and make clear resolutions regarding the Party's position and responsibilities during the constitutional preparation period. (4) It is hoped that all comrades will recognize the environment, reflect on themselves, conduct thorough reviews, strive for reform, and fulfill the Party's historical mission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang delivered the following speech at the opening ceremony of the Third Plenary Session today:</p>
<p>Comrades: Today, our Party is holding the Sixth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, exactly one year since the closing of the Second Plenary Session. Comrades have gathered in the capital to review past achievements, exchange work experiences, analyze the current situation, and establish the direction of our Party's future efforts. This will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the advancement of our revolutionary nation-building tasks. It is especially gratifying to reunite with many comrades after a year apart.</p>
<p>Task of Returning Power to the People Accomplished</p>
<p>The greatest task left to us by the Second Plenary Session was to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the Constitution, and implement constitutional government, in order to fulfill our long-cherished wish of ending political tutelage and returning power to the people. This task, after numerous twists and turns, was finally accomplished satisfactorily thanks to the united efforts of various domestic parties and social leaders, as well as the sincere cooperation of our Party comrades. Since the promulgation of the Constitution at the end of last year, the government has been proceeding with the advancement of constitutional preparation procedures in accordance with the resolutions of the National Assembly. At the same time, in accordance with the consensus reached at the Political Consultative Conference, we are expanding the foundation of our National Government. As of now, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan have already been joined by people from various parties, and the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will also be reorganized and completed in the shortest possible time. Such concerted efforts will surely be able to implement Sun Yat-sen’s teachings and complete the nation-building process, to comfort the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance over the past fifty years. This is the first thing I want to report to the Assembly.</p>
<p>Regarding the progress of peaceful construction, it is most heartbreaking to talk about. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session pointed out that the nationalization of the military is the foundation of peaceful unification. Only when the country has a unification that matches its name in reality can democracy be truly realized and economic construction be carried out. Therefore, it was confirmed that there should no longer be armed rebellions in our country, and there should no longer be disorderly phenomena in various localities. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session also pointed out that stabilizing order and alleviating the people's suffering are urgent needs, and restoring transportation, especially reviving the economy, must be the top priorities. Therefore, the declaration of the Second Plenary Session resolutely demanded that the Communist troops stop continuing their attacks and obstruction of unification actions. The National Government's handling of domestic political disputes is based on this principle. The government deeply understands the suffering of the people across the country after surviving the disaster, as well as the devastation of the society after the war, and is unwilling to subject them to further damage. Therefore, for the military actions of the Communist Party's armed separatism that hinder unification and harm the people, it has repeatedly exercised restraint in order to resolve them through political methods and mediation. In the past year, the government has issued three cease-fire orders and conducted countless negotiations under the mediation of friendly country America, but the Communist Party has always blindly believed in force and broken faith. The government, in accordance with the troop reduction plan, implemented troop reductions, while the Communist Party continued to expand its troops. Every time the government issued a cease-fire order, the Communist troops took the opportunity to continue expanding their occupation. Finally, they refused to participate in the National Assembly and denied the Constitution passed by the National Assembly. They also flatly rejected the government's proposal to send representatives to negotiate peace.</p>
<p>Communist Rebellion Makes Construction Difficult</p>
<p>The developments of the past three months have proved that the path of political resolution is already hopeless, and the Communist Party's full-scale rebellion and military actions obstructing unification have expanded day by day. In the Northeast, they have twice attacked Changchun, and in Shandong, they have continuously attacked Qingdao and Jinan. In recent days, they have launched fierce offensives in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi. With such a rebellious situation expanding day by day, the people across the country demand stability, but the Communist Party refuses to allow a moment of peace. The people across the country call for peace, but the Communist Party insists on expanding turmoil. The government, in order to defend national unification and ensure the safety of the people, naturally cannot sit idly by and fail to stop the turmoil. However, the country's vitality has been exhausted and ravaged, and the reconstruction work has been greatly hindered. The people have suffered immense hardship, and the progress of economic construction is even more difficult. This is truly the greatest misfortune for the country!</p>
<p>I want to make it clear to our comrades that the course of the Chinese national revolution over the past fifty years has been full of difficulties, but every difficulty has added another trial and increased another ray of light. From the Northern Warlords to the Japanese imperialists to today's Communist Party, they are all obstacles encountered during our nation's recovery and difficulties that we must overcome. As long as we follow the aspirations of the people across the country, follow the proper path of saving the country and building the nation, and gather patriotic people from across the country to fight together, there is nothing we cannot succeed in. Therefore, our most important and urgent task today is still to do our best. We must consolidate national unification, destroy obstacles that hinder national construction, and at the same time, we will never change our policy of implementing democracy and construction, or slacken our efforts to implement constitutional government and revive the economy. What our country demands today is national unification and political democracy. Our greatest task after the victory of the War of Resistance is the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. As long as we fight steadfastly and work tirelessly, we dare to say that no force can prevent the completion of our nation-building work.</p>
<p>Should Work Together with All Parties</p>
<p>The themes we will discuss at this plenary session are certainly numerous. The proposals submitted by the Standing Committee include those on constitutional government, general politics, economics, and party affairs. I personally believe that this plenary session should pay special attention to a detailed review and make clear resolutions regarding the Party's position and responsibilities during the constitutional preparation period. We are facing the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, with only nine months until the implementation of the Constitution. This plenary session is truly a plenary session to end political tutelage. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, because the country has been plagued by many disasters, we have had to take on the important task of the country with the spirit of not shirking responsibility for the past twenty years, but we have never neglected our preparations for implementing constitutional government. During the War of Resistance, we invited various parties and social leaders to participate in the work of resisting Japan and building the nation together. The establishment of the Political Participation Council has laid the foundation for democratic politics. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, we will enter the constitutional period in the process of nation-building. In terms of the political situation, we will transition from a period in which one party is responsible to a period in which all parties are jointly responsible for the people. In the future, the responsibility of the country will be made public to all parties and the entire people. Therefore, this plenary session is truly an unprecedentedly important gathering in twenty years. We must start from this plenary session, redefine the relationship between the Party and the government, and change the awareness and concepts of our Party members during the period of political tutelage. In the past, the Party's policies were implemented by the Party through the government. In the future, all our decisions regarding national military, political, and economic matters will be sent to the government in the form of suggestions, and we will assist the government in implementing them. Before the next National Assembly convenes, although we cannot completely relinquish our responsibility for the country, we must immediately prepare to consider ourselves an ordinary political party, to be on an equal footing with other parties, to fulfill the same obligations, to enjoy the same rights, and to encourage each other with other political parties to promote the success of national construction. This is a meaning that no previous plenary session has had. I want to especially remind all comrades to carefully study and make resolutions, so that all levels of party branches and all comrades have a consistent path to follow.</p>
<p>Review Ourselves and Strive for Improvement</p>
<p>Secondly, at this plenary session, we should spend most of our time and energy focusing on reviewing our own Party. Our Party has a long history and a solid foundation, but in these twenty years, how should our qualities be improved, how should the work style of the party branches be improved, how should the relationship between the Party and the people and the Party's spirit of serving the people be reviewed and improved, how should the history of the Party be promoted, and how should the education of party members and the atmosphere of self-criticism be effectively promoted? Because we are the largest party in the country, and because we are the party that has been responsible for the country for the longest time, there is undoubtedly no lack of shortcomings and inertia in our Party. How should we correct these shortcomings and eliminate these inertia? Especially in today's situation where the country is plagued by disasters and the revolutionary environment is dangerous, how should we strengthen our self-confidence and mutual trust? In the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, how should we cultivate the magnanimous attitude of our party members to get along sincerely with other parties? All these kinds of problems require comrades from the entire session to humbly and calmly study, gather ideas, and make resolutions. We must know that our Party exists for saving the country and building the nation. Only by improving our Party can we enrich our Party. Only by enriching our Party can our Party shoulder its responsibility to the country.</p>
<p>Comrades, our President Chiang often said: "Within the country, if one thing is not in its place, it means that our revolutionary responsibility has not been fulfilled." This is truly a very precious instruction. Now it has been two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, but reconstruction has not been completed, construction is hindered, the people's livelihood is difficult, society is precarious, the economy is unstable, and people's minds are scattered. The independence and equality of our country have not yet been truly guaranteed. These are all the shame of all our party comrades, and it is also the responsibility we should bear to our compatriots across the country, to the revolutionary martyrs, and to the military and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance. I hope that all comrades will recognize the environment, reflect on themselves, take advantage of this session to conduct thorough reviews, and strive for reform, so that we can encourage all party comrades to be loving, sincere, responsible, and devoted to their duties, be worthy of being Sun Yat-sen’s followers, and fulfill the historical mission of maintaining the glory of the War of Resistance and promoting the success of nation-building.</p>
<h3>Personnel with Best Performance to Be Summoned Periodically by the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] In order to encourage outstanding civil servants in their duties, Chairman Chiang has specially instructed that the personnel with the best performance in the central Party (League), government, and military agencies of this city in the 35th year of the Republic of China be summoned on the 24th after the National Government Memorial Week.</p>
<h3>Korean Communist Troops Land in Dalian; Over 4,000 Rapidly Advance to the Shili River Frontline; Strange Planes Strafe Pulandian Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qianyang, 15th] Military News: At 10:00 AM on the 9th, over 4,000 Korean Communist troops, fully equipped with Russian-style weapons, arrived from northern Korea and landed in Dalian, and have rapidly advanced to the Shili River frontline. Furthermore, the Communist army plans to conscript 150,000 soldiers in the Liaodong Peninsula, which has already begun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] Military News: At 1:00 PM on the 12th, a twin-engine bomber of unknown nationality suddenly flew over Songmutiao to an area 10 kilometers west of Pulandian near Bijia Mountain and strafed at low altitude for a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The weather in Pulandian is turning warmer, and the surrounding sea and Dasha River are about to thaw. There is water on the ice, and ice under the water, making passage dangerous, which is greatly disadvantageous to the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Fiercely Attack Along Niuwu Town; Fierce Battles in Fuxian County, Northern Shaanxi; Offensives Launched Against the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 15th] East of Yonghe, western Shanxi, a large number of Communist troops crossed the river westward on the 13th and have increased their attacks south of Yanchang. The battle situation in the eastern and northeastern areas of Fuxian County today is fierce. Communist troops are fiercely attacking the National Army along Niuwu Town. The National Army is firmly defending and is still in fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] Chen Geng of the Taiyue Military Region of the Communist Army convened a military conference in Anze to support the Yan'an decision, resolving to launch an offensive on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, with its troops attacking Yicheng, Jiangxian, Fushan, Jishi, and Huoxian. The troops of the Lvliang Military Region are responsible for attacking Daning and Puxian. The troops of the Taiyue Military Sub-district Commander Yuan Yong and the 456th police regiment are responsible for attacking Quwo, Houma, and Linfen.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liang Huazhi's Opinion: If the Communist army loses in Hebei, Shandong, and Shaanxi, they will all retreat to Shanxi, and Shanxi will inevitably become the decisive battleground between the Nationalists and the Communists.

Furthermore, the Communist troops in Taolaizhao, Xishisanjia, encountered another Communist force, resulting in a misunderstanding and a fierce battle lasting four hours, with significant casualties.</p>

Our advancing troops from Changchun arrived at Liangyimen south of Nong'an at 12:00 noon today, and established contact with the Nong'an army on the Baijiagangzi line, encircling over 10,000 Communist troops between Liangyimen and Nong'an.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The National Army on the left wing of the Jinpu Railway pointed east towards Taian, and after recovering Daolangzhen and Dawangzhuang on the 15th, they had reached the suburbs of Taian by the afternoon, and Taian is expected to fall soon.

<h3>Tidbits from the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Song Falls off the List</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] When the Presidium was elected at the preparatory meeting of the plenary session, the Chairman first nominated double the number of candidates from the list of executive committee members. Among the 22 candidates nominated, Song Ziwen was also one of them. As a result of the voting, Song received a total of nine votes, ranking 22nd, making him the last person to be eliminated from the list of candidates. Song is still enjoying the spring scenery in Hangzhou and will not attend the meeting in Nanjing. During the voting, there were a total of 183 voters, with Sun Ke receiving the most votes, followed by Yu Youren, and Chen Guofu third. Li Wenfan ranked 12th, being the first to be eliminated. In addition, Cheng Qian, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Daofan, Duan Xipeng, Liang Hancao, He Zhonghan, Masiwude, Zhang Lisheng, and Zhu Jiquing were also on the list of candidates for the Presidium.</p>
<p>Reporters Unable to Enter the Venue</p>
<p>During this plenary session, regarding news reporting, it was decided that the Central News Agency would broadcast nationwide. Today, when the general meeting was held, there were only a few reporters in the gallery. This is in stark contrast to the unprecedentedly lively situation during the National Assembly held in the same venue (National Assembly Hall) last winter, when more than a hundred reporters crowded into the gallery. The plenary session adopted a policy of not welcoming reporters from various newspapers to enter the venue for interviews, which will also be the first phenomenon of its kind in previous plenary sessions. Today, reporters from various newspapers can only be active outside the venue, using their talents and efforts to inquire, but the gains are minimal. The general meeting has a news release group, which is managed by personnel from the Central Propaganda Department and distributes news in the morning and afternoon, so the place is quite deserted. Party newspapers such as the Central Daily News (a public bulletin) have also requested to send reporters to enter the venue, but have now abandoned this plan.</p>
<p>Central Committee Members Dare Not Travel by Plane</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony of the general meeting this morning, a total of 253 Central Committee members attended, including 136 executive members, 47 alternate executive committee members, 50 central supervisory committee members, and 20 alternate supervisory committee members, which is less than the number of attendees at the previous sessions. There are a total of 460 Central Committee members, and fewer attended this time. One reason is the transportation barriers in various places, and the third is that, in view of the recent plane crashes, many timid and elderly Central Committee members dare not risk their lives on a plane. In addition, another reason is that some Central Committee members who are soldiers must sit in command as the Communist army is launching a spring offensive, so they cannot get away. When the preparatory meeting was held this morning, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng announced that "those absent Central Executive Committee members will be replaced in accordance with Article 35 of the Rules of Procedure of the Chairman, and the 46 alternate executive committee members who attend the meeting can be replaced in order, and have temporary voting rights in the meeting."</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony at the Mausoleum</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of this Third Plenary Session was held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, after the mausoleum visit, and the preparatory meeting at 9:30 was held at the National Assembly Hall, where the National Assembly was held last winter. There were 2,058 seats in the hall, which was still not enough during the National Assembly. But this time there were only 253 attendees, so the venue was very empty. In addition, the equipment and layout inside and outside the venue are far less than during the National Assembly, so it presents a different scene. It was decided that the number of reporters from various local newspapers who were sent to Nanjing to report on the National Assembly reached more than 350, and the number of reporters entering the venue also reached more than 100. This time, there were very few people coming to Nanjing, and the Central News Agency's reporters attending the plenary session were also less than ten people. The cost of the general meeting was 30 million yuan, and there were nearly 300 staff members, who were drawn from the original personnel of various agencies such as the Central Party Headquarters, and each person received a subsidy of 10,000 yuan per day.</p>

Liu's unit entered the Taihang Mountains for reorganization and replenishment of new recruits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 15th] The Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has recently become active again. Over 10,000 Communist troops from Wan, Tang, and Wang in western Hebei have detoured north. It is reported that the Communist army gathered between Mancheng in the north and Zijing Pass in Yixian has reached 30,000. The Communist army outside Baoding is also moving frequently.

<h3>Statement from Our Embassy in the Soviet Union: Refusal to Participate in Informal Meeting; Molotov Has Abandoned Original Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Moscow, 15th Broadcast: Following the formal refusal of the Chinese Embassy to participate in the three-power informal meeting, both Marshall and Bevin have reconsidered Molotov's suggestion regarding discussing the Chinese situation. Marshall and Bevin believe that the Chinese issue should not be discussed first. On the other hand, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to no longer insist on discussing the Chinese situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Our embassy in the Soviet Union has issued a statement saying: "Because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent letters to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin, suggesting convening an informal meeting of the three foreign ministers, with Chinese representatives participating, so that the three countries could provide information for the implementation of the 1945 Moscow Conference Communiqué concerning China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, through the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, has today expressed to Marshall and Bevin that the Chinese government cannot participate in or agree to this meeting." It is reported that before issuing the above statement, Ambassador Fu Bingchang visited Marshall and Bevin this morning, discussing matters with them for one hour and twenty minutes each.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall inquired whether China would accept Molotov's suggestion to attend a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the report on the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Declaration on China. Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, has already delivered Foreign Minister Wang's written reply to General Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 15th and requested them to forward it to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The content of the reply is as follows: The 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Declaration on China was not attended by the Chinese government, and because that declaration was aimed at China's internal affairs, it was deeply opposed by the Chinese people. The Chinese people's eight years of resistance war was originally aimed at striving for freedom and independence. That declaration inevitably harms their sense of independence and autonomy. Therefore, the Chinese government cannot participate in or agree to the foreign ministers' meeting proposed by the Soviet Foreign Minister with the aim of discussing the 1945 Declaration on China. China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States are countries fighting side by side, and it is absolutely necessary to mutually respect their status and the self-esteem of their people. We solemnly request the foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to cease any discussion involving China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th Dispatch] According to the London Times correspondent in Moscow: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has telegraphed the British government, requesting instructions on how to respond to Molotov's suggestion to start informal meetings early to discuss the Chinese issue. He stated that before leaving London, Bevin assured the governments of the various autonomous territories that he would not participate in any discussions regarding Far Eastern issues while in Moscow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cincinnati, Ohio, 15th Dispatch] Gu Ziren, the director-general of the World Student Federation, declared here today that the Soviet Union's attempt to drag the China issue into the Moscow meeting is merely to inform the Chinese Communist Party that the Soviet Union is still backing them. The Soviet Union has provided assistance to the CCP. The Soviet Union should have withdrawn from Dalian and Harbin on December 3, 1945, but has still not left to this day.</p>
<h3>Public Sentiment Boils Over in Opposition to Interference in Internal Affairs</h3>

<p>Hangzhou: The Hangzhou Journalists Association today issued a declaration expressing indignation at the Soviet Union's suggestion to interfere in Chinese political affairs at the Moscow Conference, and deeply hopes that compatriots across the country will be of one heart and one mind to strengthen peaceful unification. In addition, the Hangzhou Municipal Council, representing 450,000 citizens, also telegraphed the whole country, expressing the same sentiment.</p>

<h3>Yang Liangong Telegraphed the Control Yuan: Order Gradually Returning to All Parts of Taiwan; Ge Jingen to Visit the Chairman Today to Report</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Supervising Commissioner Yang Liangong of Fujian and Taiwan telegraphed the Control Yuan on the 14th, reporting that: after broadcasting and informing of the Chairman's and the central government's benevolent intentions, order is gradually returning to Taitung, Tainan, Taichung, and other places. The situations at the Kaohsiung and Chiayi airfields have been pacified. Yang is currently going to visit National Taiwan University. The school has not started, but there is no damage.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Government, after arriving in Nanjing, is scheduled to pay a visit to the Chairman on the 16th to report on the truth of the February 28th Incident and make some requests. Regarding the current politics of Taiwan, he will also have concrete discussions with Minister Bai. After decisions are made in Nanjing, he will fly back to Taipei with Minister Bai, and Chen Yi will remain in Taiwan to await the central government's handling methods.</p>
<p>Ge's Remarks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, flew to Nanjing by special plane at noon on the 14th, welcoming Minister Bai to Taiwan. When reporters visited him to inquire about the current situation in Taiwan, Ge made the following remarks: "On the 28th of last month, riots broke out in Taipei. The reason for this incident was that the lackeys left over from the Japanese rule era, and the Taiwanese ruffians repatriated from overseas, incited by traitors, took advantage of the Monopoly Bureau's opportunity to investigate and suppress illegal cigarettes, and instigated the exclusion of mainlanders, creating terrorist incidents and disrupting public order. After careful handling by the government, transportation such as railways and highways is now smooth, and order is gradually restored. All counties and cities in the province have resumed normal operations. As for the central government sending troops to Taiwan, it was originally to protect good people from being held hostage by a few rioters. Now the people have understood the government's measures, and some of those who joined in echoing them are deeply remorseful, and some have come to apologize. In the future, if Taiwan is not subject to external provocation, it will be able to quickly return to normal. Regarding the issue of provincial government reform, the Taiwan Provincial Government has long had the intention of reorganizing the government. Once approved by the central government, it can be implemented. The implementation of popular elections for county and city mayors is also being prepared early and can be implemented ahead of schedule before the implementation of the constitution. The reports that "the Taiwan delegation to Shanghai lost their freedom of movement after arriving in Taiwan" and that "more than 200 Taiwanese industry leaders are still imprisoned, and more than 20 students have been detained" are not true. When the Shanghai delegation to Taiwan arrived, it was already evening, and martial law was in effect. For safety reasons, they were advised not to go out, but their freedom was not restricted. Moreover, Minister Bai, as a representative, lived in the same hotel and should have been protected. The Taipei Garrison Headquarters has indeed captured a small number of rioters in recent days. These people participated in the looting of military warehouses and attacks on military and government agencies on the 8th and 9th of this month. After interrogation, those with minor circumstances have been gradually released."</p>

Other counties and cities have not yet carried out this work. The newly appointed Mayor of Hsinchu, Chen Zhenbin, is the first mayor designated by Governor Chen Yi to fulfill his promise. Chen was originally the chief secretary of the Hsinchu City Government.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Six Taiwanese Organizations in Beijing and Shanghai Host a Reception for Journalists and Issue a Statement in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Taiwan 228 Massacre慰問团, organized by representatives of six Taiwanese organizations in Beijing and Shanghai, including Zhang Weixian, Li Weiguang, and Chen Chongguang, took a special plane from the Ministry of National Defense to Taiwan on the 11th, but due to the dire situation, returned to Beijing the next morning. The團 hosted a reception for the local press at the青年会 at 2:00 PM yesterday. Li Weiguang reported on the motivation for organizing the團 to visit Taiwan and its itinerary [see page of this newspaper on the 14th], and issued a written statement, which stated in brief:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>The 228 Incident was entirely due to the Taiwanese people's dissatisfaction with Taiwan's special administrative governor, the monopoly, the trade control system, and the rampant corruption of Taiwanese officials, which made it impossible for the people to live and forced the incident to occur. He pointed out that the seizure of 1.8 million Taiwanese dollars and 54 private seals from the home of a certain section chief of the Civil Affairs Department of Hsinchu County, Taiwan, was enough to show the corruption of Taiwanese officials.</p>
<p>Ringleaders</p>
<p>He further analyzed the ringleaders who participated in the incident as being extremely complex. (1) More than 40,000 Taiwanese people who were conscripted by the Japanese during the war to fight in various places in the South Seas and Hainan Island. After the war, they became the backbone, including a part of the senators and students, who had political demands. (3) The rogues and underground personnel who were previously under the command of the Japanese in Taiwan took the opportunity to move around, alienating the feelings of the Taiwanese and mainland compatriots, and cruelly killed and injured mainland compatriots. These were all done by them. Most Taiwanese people have absolutely no psychology of excluding mainland compatriots. Chen Yi has always adopted a protective attitude towards these rogues and underground personnel. (4) Chen Yi falsely reported to the central government that the riot was instigated by communist elements, which was actually an excuse for his past. Even if we dare not断Taiwan has absolutely no communist activities, even if there are very few, they are not enough to launch such a large-scale incident.</p>
<p>Source of Weapons</p>
<p>As for the source of weapons for this incident, it is said that the Japanese buried part of the weapons in the deep mountains or scattered them among the people when they surrendered the year before. The Governor's Office repeatedly received confidential reports, but Chen Yi ignored them. After the Taiwanese people in Beijing and Shanghai confirmed the matter to the Ministry of National Defense, Chen才once hired workers to excavate in the mountains. However, the workers eventually stopped working because they were not paid and had no life security. This became the original source of weapons for the riot.</p>
<p>Two Requirements</p>
<p>The团末提出要求Chairman promised to immediately abolish the governor system,专制system, and trade control system within the scope allowed by the constitution, and to clearly order Chen Yi to be dismissed and severely punished. (2) The government's Taiwan善后should avoid the use of force, and guarantee that it will no longer pursue the people who participated in the Taiwan Incident, and call on local fair people to persuade all industries to resume operations and stabilize order.</p>
<h3>Fictitious Military Agency Case Cracked Outside Beiyingmen, Tianjin; More Than 20 Main "Officers" Arrested</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin] The Tianjin Municipal Police and Garrison authorities cracked down on a fictitious military agency on the 11th, calling itself the "Second Division Headquarters of the Coastal Defense Army." The "Adjutant General," "Chief of Staff," and "Brigade Commander of the Fourth Brigade" of the "Second Division of the Coastal Defense Army," as well as more than twenty others, were arrested on the spot. "Division Commander Zhao Dengming," who claimed to be the younger brother of the late famous general Zhao Dengyu, escaped. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Duowei, the manager of the Shengli Freight Yard at No. 3 Lujia Hutong, Beiyingmenwai Avenue, Tianjin, previously met Zhao Dengming, who claimed to be the "Division Commander of the Second Division of the Coastal Defense Army." Zhao bragged to Li and appointed him as the "Director of Military Supplies." Li was trapped and gave his freight yard to Zhao Dengming to serve as the "Headquarters" of the "Second Coastal Defense Army." After establishing the "Headquarters," Zhao Dengming further launched a large-scale operation, manufacturing military uniforms, symbols, appointment letters, and so on. He appointed "brigade commanders," "regiment commanders," "battalion commanders," "chiefs of staff," "adjutants," and so on, and sent people to Jinghai, Cangxian, and other places to recruit new soldiers.</p>
<p>The Tianjin security authorities previously arrested several "officers" wearing "Second Coastal Defense Army" symbols in the city, and they were all arrested during the cracking of cases of fraud, injury, theft, etc. Because they did not know to which this "unit" belonged, they requested instructions from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. After receiving a reply, they learned that it was an illegal organization. They went to Beiyingmen, surrounded and searched the "Headquarters," and arrested more than 20 people, including "Brigade Commander of the Fourth Brigade" Zhu Jingqi, "Major Adjutant" Zhao Yongmao, "Chief of Staff" Cui Tongshan, "Director of Military Supplies" Li Duowei, and others. In addition, seven people, including "Adjutant General" Ding Ziyan, were escorted from Jinghai County. On the spot, they also seized forged official seals, symbols, appointment letters, and other items, as well as two large guns, several small guns, and more than 30 large knives, which were the "equipment" of the "division." The handling of this case is currently being requested by the Garrison Headquarters from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Absolutely Not Participating in Discussions of Chinese Issues Outside of the Conference</h3>
<p>Our government, on the 14th, solemnly declared to the four nations of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, through diplomatic channels, that China would not send representatives to participate in discussions of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference. This diplomatic measure is truly the most wise decision made by our diplomatic authorities and should be supported unanimously by the people of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attempted to instigate the joint intervention of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in China's internal affairs. Therefore, on the first day of the Moscow Conference's opening, he proposed including the Chinese issue on the agenda. Unexpectedly, Molotov's rash actions stirred up a great international uproar. Not only did the 450 million Chinese people, who felt insulted, erupt in angry protests, but also people of conscience in other countries expressed their disapproval. Such an absurd proposal could not possibly be agreed to by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall. In the second meeting, Molotov himself deeply realized the irrationality of his proposal and had to change course, abandoning his original proposal and adopting Foreign Secretary Bevin's compromise solution, agreeing that the Chinese issue would be discussed informally outside the conference by the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall insisted on his consistent position that no discussion of the Chinese issue should take place without the participation of Chinese representatives, which Molotov also accepted. Although Molotov's attitude inevitably lacked the demeanor of a diplomat due to his about-face, in his heart, he was still pleased with himself, believing that as long as the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union discussed the Chinese issue in Moscow, whether within or outside the conference, or in any other way, it would not be difficult to achieve his goal of instigating the three nations to jointly interfere in China's internal affairs. Therefore, we must persist in opposing international interference and firmly oppose the discussion of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference, or in any other way, in order to shatter Molotov's delusional dream of instigating international interference.</p>
<p>On the opening day of the Moscow Conference, we expressed our opinion, hoping that the four powers would not include the Chinese issue on the agenda, and stated that whether the four powers could respect the public will of our people would be a major test of the foreign ministers' conference. Later, upon hearing Molotov's proposal, we could not help but loudly protest against international interference and protest Molotov's insulting attitude. Now, we still maintain this basic stance and express our opposition to discussing the Chinese issue outside the conference. We have always cherished the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and will never act emotionally. Although we have suffered intolerable insults from Molotov, our rationality can still restrain the overflow of feelings. Therefore, our opposition to discussing the Chinese issue outside the conference is not based on subjective emotional impulses but stems from our calm reason. Our reasons are explained in detail below:</p>
<p>First, the Soviet Union's request for the three foreign ministers to discuss the Chinese issue, whether within or outside the conference or in any other way, harbors a conspiracy to instigate international interference in China's internal affairs, which not only violates the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance but also undermines the Charter of the United Nations. Molotov must know that China is not a defeated nation but a victorious nation with undeniable achievements. The Soviet Union not only recognizes China as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and one of the five member states of the postwar foreign ministers' conference but also has a treaty of friendship and alliance with China. How can the Soviet Union bring up the internal affairs of a friendly nation that is on equal footing with it for discussion? And how can it instigate other nations to jointly interfere? Therefore, we cannot help but doubt whether Molotov has the Charter of the United Nations, the Potsdam Agreement, or the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in mind. International relations are based on trust and integrity. If a nation like the Soviet Union has no trust and integrity to speak of, how can we expect it to be among the ranks of powerful nations and lead all nations to jointly create world peace?</p>
<p>Second, the people of all nations in the world yearn for the world after World War II to enter an era of peace and democracy as soon as possible, so that humanity will no longer have to suffer the threat of war. But how can this ideal be realized? Everyone agrees that the ominous names of "power politics" and "secret diplomacy," which contributed to war, should no longer be seen in the postwar world of peace and democracy. But in reality, the situation is quite different. The Yalta Conference of February 1945 secretly made decisions regarding the Chinese issue, and the Moscow Conference of December 1945 issued a declaration concerning our nation without our participation. All of this has caused deep pain and resentment among our people. In the future, we will never want to see the re-enactment of "secret diplomacy" in international politics, nor will we want to see the revival of "power politics." Otherwise, world peace and collective security are all deceptive terms, and humanity will never have the hope of living freely and peacefully together.</p>
<p>Third, although China's internal problems are extremely serious, we believe that we will surely find a way to solve them ourselves. The Chinese people are a nation of utmost greatness and strength, who have endured internal strife and foreign aggression and will ultimately be able to overcome any difficulties. The great powers can rest assured that China's internal problems, as long as they do not have an international background that makes them more complicated, will not endanger international peace. Therefore, Molotov's excuse that "the situation in China has not improved" to justify discussing the Chinese issue is simply unreasonable. As for our request for the United States to mediate the problems between the Nationalists and the Communists, it was made voluntarily. Therefore, when General Marshall came to China to mediate for peace, the people of the entire nation expressed a warm welcome. When he announced his abandonment of mediation, we did not insist on it either. It cannot be considered that the United States was interfering in China's internal affairs. Now, before the opening of the Moscow Conference, our diplomatic authorities had already declared that the Chinese issue should not be included on the agenda. The foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and the United States unanimously expressed their agreement, and even the Soviet government did not express any dissent, which can be considered tacit approval. However, after the conference opened, Molotov insisted on raising the Chinese issue for discussion. After being rejected, he still requested to discuss it outside the conference. Molotov's intentions are obvious. Now that China has expressed its firm opposition and decided not to send representatives to participate, if the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union still disregard the will of the Chinese people and brazenly discuss it, this would be an unforgivable interference in China's internal affairs! It absolutely cannot be confused with the United States' mediation!</p>
<p>From the above, our opposition to international interference and our refusal to allow Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to discuss the Chinese issue, whether within or outside the conference, are justified and confident. Apart from Molotov, who has ulterior motives, all people of conscience express sympathy for our protest. In particular, Secretary of State Marshall and Foreign Secretary Bevin will not be deceived by Molotov. The fact that the British and American foreign ministers have been slow to respond to Molotov's letters, and the future is becoming bleak, is excellent proof. Moreover, the Chinese government has already notified the four nations through diplomatic channels, stating that China will not send representatives to participate in discussions of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference. If the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union do hold informal discussions on the Chinese issue, no matter what decisions they make, our country will not be bound by them. Therefore, the result will not affect our country, but will only reveal Molotov's futile efforts.</p>

<h3>Promoting the Democratization of German Politics; Marshall Suggests Five Points; Four Foreign Ministers Announce German Prisoner of War Figures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Secretary of State Marshall today presented to the Foreign Ministers' Conference a statement on promoting democracy in Germany, proposing that the Berlin Conference instruct the Allied Control Council to prepare for the revival of Germany's democratic political life and for Germany's peaceful cooperation in international life. This directive should be more specific to ensure that the process of promoting German democracy is unified in all four zones. Only in Germany do the Allies have the opportunity to demonstrate to the world the sincerity of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations regarding democratic goals. The lack of agreement on the protection of political and economic freedoms in the various zones of Germany prevents the Germans from jointly preparing for the reconstruction of democracy. Restrictions imposed after the war must now be lifted. Merely eliminating Nazi forces is not enough to democratize Germany; positive action must be taken to restore the German people's democratic political and economic life. In his statement, Marshall also pointed out that democracy is often interpreted in various ways. The United States government and the American people believe that mankind possesses certain inalienable basic rights, including the freedom for each individual to develop their thoughts freely, without infringing on the rights of others, and without intimidation or coercion. A society in which people who respect the rights of others are not free to express their beliefs cannot be considered democratic. If law-abiding citizens live in fear of being deprived of their lives, property, or the right to work happily, that society is not free.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The five basic plans proposed by Secretary Marshall are as follows: (1) Unanimously guarantee all basic civil rights that the German people should enjoy; (2) Guarantee the right of political parties to participate in free and fair elections; (3) Guarantee free trade; (4) Guarantee the freedom of newspapers and radio stations throughout Germany; (5) Guarantee the freedom of movement of people and goods throughout Germany.</p>
<p>Secretary Marshall then submitted a report stating that there are currently 30,976 German prisoners of war in the American-occupied zone, and they are scheduled to be dealt with in June. He said that the meaning of democracy varies from person to person, but the U.S. government has a basic definition for it: human rights cannot be transferred or taken away. With regard to the freedom of newspapers and radio stations, it is inextricably linked to democracy and freedom. He concluded by saying that there were originally 117 arsenals in the American-occupied zone, and 80 of them have already been dismantled, and the remainder will be destroyed this year.</p>
<p>At this point, Molotov expressed his opinion, saying that he could not agree with Secretary Marshall on the fourth point and would respond later.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced that the United Kingdom still holds 435,295 German prisoners of war, with 17,500 being sent to the UK each month to work, but starting on July 1, 20,000 people will be sent back to their home country each month. French Foreign Minister Bidault said that France currently holds 631,483 people, of whom 500,000 are working in France.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the four countries have scheduled a meeting tomorrow to discuss the exchange and movement of people and the division of territory. In addition, the issue of compensation will also be raised for discussion, but Molotov requested more time to calculate the exact amount. It is reported that the amount of German compensation requested by the Soviet Union is 10 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reported to the other three foreign ministers this morning that the Soviet Union currently holds 890,532 German prisoners of war, but he did not specify how many prisoners of war are currently in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Regarding the number of German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, TASS Moscow broadcast on the 15th provided an answer, stating that since the end of the war, a total of 1,003,974 German prisoners of war have been repatriated, and 890,532 remain in Soviet territory.</p>
<h3>One Week Since Opening, Foreign Ministers' Conference Achieves Nothing; Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meetings Also Deadlocked</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Moscow, 15th broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been in session for a week and has made no progress. Currently, there are three major problems: (1) After China refused to participate in discussions outside the conference, it is extremely difficult for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to take another new step; (2) How to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees still in concentration camps in Germany; (3) How to reorganize the internal affairs of Germany. After the four deputy foreign ministers met today, a deadlock formed. The Soviet representative's request to allow Albania to participate in the negotiations for the German peace treaty was rejected by the United States and Britain, resulting in a postponement of the meeting, with negotiations to resume next week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] In an atmosphere of such turbulence, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which has achieved nothing, held its last meeting of the week at 4:00 p.m. to discuss the disposal of the millions of displaced people in German refugee camps and the division of German borders. The four foreign ministers met as usual at 11:00 a.m., but due to the disappearance of the peaceful atmosphere in Moscow, there was no hope of success. If the deputy foreign ministers cannot break the deadlock, the dispute over the German-Austrian peace treaty will only be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. One of the main differences in the deputy foreign ministers' meetings is that Britain, the United States, and France agree that Austria can have an army of 55,000 men, while the Soviet Union wants to limit it to 50,000, so that it does not exceed the military strength of its Balkan countries. The Soviet Union also proposed that Austrian military weapons be limited to those manufactured domestically and that they be prohibited from purchasing them from foreign countries, but Britain and the United States believe that this would hinder Austrian sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Moscow broadcast: The deputy foreign ministers' meetings have been stalled due to the British and American refusal to include Albania in the discussions of the German peace treaty. The Soviet Union requested that Albania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia participate in the conference on the German peace treaty at the same time, but Britain and the United States believe that these countries helped the Axis powers during the war, especially because they continued to invade after Germany, and therefore do not allow them to do so. The Moscow broadcast stated that no agreement was reached on this matter in the deputy foreign ministers' meetings, so it was postponed to next Monday for discussion. Which countries should participate in the discussion of the basic issues of the German peace treaty remains undetermined. If the deadlock cannot be broken next week, the dispute can only be reported to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<h3>Change of Command for U.S. Occupation Forces in Germany</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 15th] General McNarney, Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe, is stepping down. General Clay will take over here, and he will receive a medal for his contributions to completing the task of the U.S. military government and merging the economies of the British and American occupation zones. In his speech, McNarney emphasized that the displaced people are waiting to be dealt with by the military government. Clay replied that the U.S. military should continue to work hard to achieve peace and security. McNarney has now been transferred to serve as the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations Military Committee.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Issues Latest Occupation Report, Analyzes Strategies of Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 15th] In addition to praising the achievements of democratization, MacArthur's latest occupation report also pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party has recently been working hard to organize a united anti-government front. The report analyzes the Communist Party's strategies, stating: "The Communist Party attacks the government's economic policies in the Diet and announces that it will implement 'democratic' legislative procedures in accordance with the Constitution. Outside the Diet, it attempts to promote anti-government activities through labor unions and farmers' organizations, and seeks coordination with the Social Democratic Party at any time."</p>
<p>The report also stated that in various local institutions, the Communist Party decided to abandon its own candidates and support "democratic" candidates nominated by various labor unions and people's organizations. In the Diet, the Communist Party supports the Social Democratic Party's cabinet. The Communist Party continues to seek the support of small and medium-sized merchants and farmers for a united front against the Yoshida cabinet.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of public order, the report stated that strikes and demonstrations in December have decreased, but there are still some acts of sabotage.</p>
<p>Four Important Bills of the Current Diet</p>
<p>The report also mentioned that Japan is making great progress towards becoming a truly democratic country. In the 91st emergency Diet from November 26 to December 25, a motion to dissolve the Yoshida cabinet was rejected by a vote of 236 to 160. The four important bills passed by the current Diet are: (1) Election of a House of Councillors to replace the House of Peers; (2) The future cabinet must be responsible to the Diet; (3) Restriction of the powers of the Imperial Household Ministry; (4) Imperial property will belong to the state.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Decides to Restrict Japanese Consumable Goods</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The Far Eastern Commission announced today a decision to restrict Japanese consumable goods, such as machinery, cotton, ceramics, and electrical materials, in order to increase exports to supply countries that have been invaded by Japan in the past. Unless MacArthur issues other instructions, the amount of cotton consumed should be limited to 2.5 pounds per person per year, with workers allowed to increase slightly, but the total amount must not exceed 50 million pounds.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Agrees to Japan's Temporary Compensation Plan, But Does Not Allow Deduction of Materials Removed from Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The Far Eastern Commission stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to the U.S. plan to authorize MacArthur to distribute 30% of the temporary compensation determined by Japanese industry to countries in urgent need. However, the Soviet Union requested that when it distributes its share, the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China should not be deducted.</p>

<h3>British Aid to Greece; Fierce Debate in the House of Commons; Final Decision to Continue Lending 19 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The House of Commons today passed a loan of 19 million pounds to aid Greece, of which 18 million pounds will be used to subsidize Greek military expenses, and 1 million pounds will be used to purchase civilian goods to donate to Greece. During the debate, Deputy Foreign Secretary McNeil said that the British government greatly supported the United Nations' Greek investigation and proposed a permanent or semi-permanent presence there. The British government will support this proposal. He also said that the Greek government, whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, must have an army to maintain order. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the political situation in Greece during the debate. He said that it is very difficult to establish a coalition cabinet in Greece, and that Bulgaria, which was an enemy country during the war, still has an army, so the Allied country of Greece should of course have an army. He also pointed out that the leaders of the Bulgarian government are not worth maintaining friendship with any country. He argued that the British government should assist Greece economically by purchasing surplus Greek tobacco, which would be more effective than the proposal being debated today.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Three members of the House of Commons Labour Party announced today that they will ask the government on the 16th to explain Britain's connection to President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey. Government officials said that Britain will discuss Truman's statement at a regular meeting on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Turkish Chief of Staff to Visit the United States at Invitation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The "Washington Star" Ankara correspondent Brown said that Turkish Chief of Staff General Omurtag will soon visit the United States at the invitation to discuss the implementation of President Truman's plan to aid Turkey. Officials at the Turkish Embassy here told our agency that they were unaware of this matter. Brown said that after receiving the invitation, General Omurtag will depart for the United States with several experts familiar with the U.S. military's general staff policies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 14th] Renowned economist Onar said today that the Turkish government will use the future U.S. loan to complete a new industrial plan.</p>
<h3>Hard Times for Salaried Class; It's Not Easy for the President to Accumulate Wealth</h3>
<p>[French New Area Agency, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 15th] President Truman's income tax bill proves that it is not easy for a head of state to accumulate wealth. The President's annual salary last year was $75,000, and after paying income tax and the White House's food expenses, only $4,200 remained.</p>
<h3>Truman's Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Receives Congressional Support; Foreign Relief Bill to Be Given Priority</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman's request for aid to Greece and Turkey has gained congressional support, with the only opposition focusing on minor restrictions to the terms. Republican Senator Aiken declared that in this critical moment, Congress seems to have no other option than to act in unison with the President. Democratic leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, anticipates that the President's proposal will be passed by a majority in both houses. A Republican leader suggested that the only way Congress could change the President's commitment to aid Greece and Turkey would be to withhold the funds, but Moscow might interpret this as weakness. Therefore, Congress has virtually no alternative but to align with the President. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, presented a confidential report to his Republican colleagues today. Upon leaving the meeting, he indicated that there were many questions requiring answers from the government, involving various aspects of financial and military aid, as well as potential repercussions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee, after consulting with Republican Party and government officials for three hours today, agreed to publicly hear opinions early next week on Truman's proposal to provide a $400 million loan to aid Greece and Turkey in resisting Communism. It is expected that while the government believes it is imperative to quickly assist Greece and Turkey to prevent a loss of balance in the Eastern Mediterranean, the President's $350 million foreign relief bill will be given priority for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Congressional members speculated today that after the U.S. implements its anti-communist policy, in addition to the $400 million loan to Greece and Turkey approved by President Truman and Congress, at least five other countries, including Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Hungary, and Palestine, may also need to borrow from the United States.</p>
<p>Greece Welcomes American Aid</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 14th] Today, local shops closed for two hours to hold a parade, expressing gratitude for America's plan to aid Greece. Prime Minister Maximos telegraphed the Turkish government through the Turkish Ambassador, declaring that Greece and Turkey now stand on the same line of democracy. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsaldaris met with the South African Ambassador for discussions, fueling rumors that South Africa and Canada are also deeply concerned about Greece's recovery. Communist leader Zachariadis published an article in "Rizospastis," denouncing the U.S. move as interference in Greece's internal affairs, possessing imperialistic ambitions, and that Truman's speech has endangered the mission of the United Nations and will incite more bloodshed.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The White House recently released a statement by President Truman, noting that the U.S. President's proposal to support Greece has not only been endorsed by the Greek government, but also by the opposition party within the Greek cabinet, which has also expressed its cooperation.</p>

<h3>Paraguayan Rebels Gain Momentum; Control Entire Northern Territory and Cut Off Railroad; International Reactions Possible</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, 15th] It is learned here that the entire northern territory of Paraguay, except for Chaco City, has fallen into the hands of the rebels. However, during the seven days of civil war, government troops have not engaged in major battles. Observers commented that Colonel Garcete, the police chief of Chaco City, maintains a neutral stance, so the key to the situation now rests with that location. There is only one regiment of troops in the city, which has joined the rebels. On Wednesday night, the rebels attempted to capture the city of Pinnacos, leading to a battle, but they were repelled by dawn the next morning. Currently, the lack of major battles is mainly due to transportation difficulties on both sides. The capital of Paraguay is sixty miles away from Concepcion City, the rebel headquarters, connected only by the Paraguay River. The railway line has been cut off by the rebels, and continuous heavy rain and rapid currents make navigation difficult, making it hard for government troops to launch a punitive expedition there.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Diplomatic sources here stated that the internal conflict in Paraguay is temporarily an internal matter, but it may soon trigger international reactions. On the 6th of this month, unrest broke out in various parts of the country, starting in the capital, but was quickly suppressed. It is rumored that the Minister of the Interior has formally condemned former President Colonel Franco as the instigator of this conspiracy, which was instigated by the Communist Party. The rebels declared that they have no partisan affiliations and only want to replace the current government with a democratic regime. Diplomatic sources continued that in July of last year, President Morinigo managed to preserve his power with the cooperation of the Progressive Party following the unrest. The current situation is reminiscent of that time, and the United States and Argentina are now closely monitoring the situation. The government of Argentine President Peron may fully support Morinigo, but the United States is different and must determine whether the cause of the rebellion is to establish a democratic government or a power struggle between political parties before it can decide its attitude.</p>
<h3>Rebellion Also Breaks Out in Ecuador; Suppressed by Government Forces</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bogota, 15th] An Ecuadoran radio station announced this morning that the military rebellion that previously occurred in the Riva Mandala area was small in scope and has now been suppressed. Rebellion leader Major Enriquez has been arrested, and five other implicated officers have also been arrested. The situation in the area is peaceful as usual, and the garrison troops are maintaining order.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Advocates Stopping Goods to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Republican Senator Flanders recently proposed a requirement that no more American cargo be shipped to the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union fulfills its obligations under the Potsdam Agreement. Flanders also denounced Soviet non-cooperation in Korea and Germany.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Secretary's Speech Calls for Strengthening National Defense; Empty Talk of Disarmament Cannot Solve Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: U.S. Navy Secretary Forrestal stated in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association that if the United States continues to reduce its military strength, "we will lose the ability to defend ourselves or others." Forrestal did not directly comment on the plan to provide economic and military assistance to Greece and Turkey, but stated that it is doubtful whether the United States can fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. World peace depends on the attitude and strength of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and mere disarmament cannot solve the problem. The Soviet Union is unwilling to establish a United Nations international force early to maintain world peace. Since the victory over Japan, the United States has destroyed the largest military organization in history. We are willing to lead the world in disarmament, but we cannot abandon national defense until we have obtained collective security.</p>
<h3>Soviet Parliamentary Delegation Urges British-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The twenty-member delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, invited to Britain by the British Parliament, was led by Kuznyetsov.

Our friendship will be carried forward and enhanced. Our friendship and mutual understanding are the guarantee of lasting peace. Members of the delegation visited Queen Elizabeth at Sandringham today.</p>
<h3>French Troops in Vietnam Occupy Lao Cai</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Saigon, 15th] The French military headquarters here recently issued a communiqué stating that since French troops have fully controlled the south of Hanoi, the people there have returned to work. The president of the Overseas Chinese Association in Nam Dinh appealed to the French authorities for protection. The French 1st Armored Regiment has occupied Lao Cai, on the border between central and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 14th] After the French army recovered Nam Dinh, the 1,500 overseas Chinese there were safe and sound. The overseas Chinese leader visited the French commander yesterday to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Seven Sailing Ships Sunk by Mines</h3>
<p>Many Casualties, Mostly Chinese</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] Saigon Radio announced that seven sailing ships sank after hitting sea mines near Ca Mau, southwest of Saigon. Fifty people died and twenty-five were injured, mostly Chinese. The whereabouts of five other ships are unknown.</p>
<h3>Melting Snow in Britain Causes Severe Flooding</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The snow on the mountains has begun to melt, causing severe flooding in various places. The water level of the Thames River here has also risen eight feet. Suburban workers are using small boats to travel to their workplaces, and traffic in various places is also obstructed. Britain is now preparing for a new war to deal with the floods. In addition, floods have also occurred in northern France, Germany, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassadors to Britain and France Return Home to Report</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Gromyko, and the Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, left here today to fly back to Moscow.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Administrative Structure to Change Soon</h3>
<p>Plans Look Good on Paper, but Substance is Doubtful</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 15th] The administrative structures of Hong Kong and other British colonies will soon undergo fundamental changes to give local people greater autonomy. The plan for changes to the Hong Kong administrative structure has been approved by the Colonial Office in London, stipulating the establishment of a municipal council with "broad representation" to gradually assume the powers of the current Hong Kong government. At the same time, the number of official personnel in the Legislative Council will be gradually reduced, so that non-official or non-government personnel can constitute a majority. Some quarters have frankly expressed doubts about this proposal, believing it to be merely "sugar-coating" for the establishment of the Income Tax Bureau. The plan looks very good on paper, but its substance depends on how the municipal council is elected and how much power it can acquire. At least two of these aspects have not yet been disclosed to the public. They also point out that half of the non-official members of the Legislative Council still need to be appointed by the Governor. "Unless more is revealed about this plan, we cannot have a complete review."</p>

<h3>Counterfeit French Currency and US Dollar Operation Cracked Opposite Caohejing Huangjia Garden; Large Quantities of Counterfeit Currency, Copper Plates, Printing Machines, Etc. Confiscated; Main Suspects, a Soviet Couple, Arrested Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Second Investigation Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Command's Investigation Office cracked an international counterfeit French currency and US dollar operation yesterday morning. The main suspects, Soviet citizens Luo Gaoqing Kaofu and Qinni Nuosi Diba La (Luo Gaoqing Kaofu's wife), as well as three Chinese, including Yang Yufen, were arrested on the spot. A quantity of finished counterfeit ten-dollar US banknotes, Central Bank of China 1945 issue one-thousand-yuan counterfeit notes, as well as a large number of copper plates, machines, instruments, chemical raw materials, etc., were confiscated. The counterfeit US dollars and French currency were identified by experts from the US military headquarters intelligence group and experts from the Central Bank, and it was temporarily impossible to recognize that they were counterfeit banknotes, demonstrating the exquisite quality of the printing.</p>
<p>It is reported that Liang Zhiping, the brigade commander of the Second Investigation Brigade, and Zhang Wenming, the brigade adjutant, received a confidential report a month ago that there was a counterfeit US dollar and French currency operation near Caohejing in this city, run by a Soviet citizen. Brigade Commander Liang then reported the situation to Director Tao Yi, and dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate.</p>
<p>Confirmed Address and Monitored for a Week</p>
<p>After more than a month of investigation, on the evening of the 7th of this month, it was confirmed that the operator of the counterfeit banknote operation was Soviet citizen Luo Gaoqing Kaofu, and that the operation was located at the home of Zhang Ziwen, the Bao Chief, at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao opposite the Huangjia Garden in Caohejing. Upon receiving the report, Brigade Commander Liang continued to send officers to the area for re-investigation. When the investigators arrived at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao, a foreign person was carrying four bundles of neatly wrapped canvas packages and jumped into a prepared car, driving away quickly. Fearing that they would alert the snake, the investigators did not reveal themselves at the time and sent people to follow, but the car drove too fast and got away. This clue having been lost, they continued to monitor the counterfeit banknote operation at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao. This continued for a week.</p>
<p>Morning Arrests: Both Suspects and Evidence Obtained</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Brigade Commander Liang led Adjutant Zhang and more than twenty investigators to Zhang Ziwen's house. Upon entering, Luo Gaoqing Kaofu and his wife, Qinni Nuosi Diba La, were studying the color separation of the Central Bank of China two-thousand-yuan notes, planning to counterfeit them. When they saw the investigators rushing into the room, they knew that their crime had been discovered, but their attitude remained exceptionally calm. They were also exceptionally quick-witted, and while talking to the investigators, they tried to escape. Fortunately, the precautions were tight, and they were not able to escape. Subsequently, counterfeit banknotes, twenty-one copper plates, a large number of chemical raw materials and counterfeit banknote printing machines, a large number of printing chemical books, and other equipment were confiscated in the room. The local Baojia Chief was also summoned to inventory everything.</p>
<p>Monthly Rent for Operation: One Million</p>
<p>Brigade Commander Liang then escorted the suspects back to the brigade headquarters and personally searched the suspect's residence at No. 2324 Feier Road, but found nothing. After interrogating the suspect severely, he confessed that the counterfeit banknote operation at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao was introduced by Yang Yufen, a Chinese beekeeper living at No. 2 Caohejing, with a monthly rent of one million French currency. Regarding the other details, he did not divulge the truth. Based on the confession, Liang sent officers to arrest Yang Yufen at the address. As for the landlord, Zhang Ziwen, he had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Four Imprisonments in Shanghai</p>
<p>The main suspect, Luo Gaoqing Kaofu, has been in Shanghai for more than twenty years and is a well-known chemist. In 1928, he was arrested for counterfeiting Dutch and Soviet passports and banknotes and was imprisoned four times, with the longest imprisonment lasting one year and six months, and the shortest lasting three months. The case of the Soviet citizen Erhuade counterfeiting US dollars, which was cracked by the Garrison Command last year, was actually a henchman of the suspect. The confiscated counterfeit French currency and US dollars are exquisitely printed. The serial number on the US banknotes is B09979758D, and the serial number of the counterfeit French currency of the Central Bank of China 1945 issue one-thousand-yuan note begins with the letters AG. As for when the suspect started counterfeiting French currency and US dollars, and the exact amount of counterfeit banknotes that have been issued, it is still impossible to know because the suspect is exceptionally cunning and refuses to tell the truth. The investigation is ongoing.</p>

<h3>Two Suspected Traitor Cases Concluded; Sentences to be Announced on the 22nd</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Cao Songhai, who was a pseudo-police officer, was accused of pouring water into and beating Huan Buyin, the pseudo-Public Works Bureau foreman, during the enemy occupation, causing him to die of cerebral hemorrhage. The case was initially tried by the pseudo-local court. After the victory, the local procuratorate transferred the case to the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court because the defendant had held a pseudo-official position. After several hearings by the High Court, the defense was heard yesterday morning. Cao still firmly denied the pouring of water and beating, and blamed it on Zhao Yinting, another fugitive defendant and pseudo-deputy detective. After a long trial, it was announced that the case was concluded, and the sentence will be announced on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Chen Mugen, originally a carpenter, was accused of recruiting workers for the enemy in 1943 to transport them to Sijiao Mountain in the Ningbo sea area to build fortifications. In the spring of 1945, American planes bombed the mountain, and some of the workers were killed. After the victory, the surviving workers sued Chen at the High Procuratorate, accusing him of being a traitor. The case was also concluded with defense yesterday, and the sentence will be announced on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Wang Xingjian, who was accused of being a radio technician at the No. 76 Pseudo-Special Agent Headquarters, was questioned in the High Court yesterday, and the hearing was rescheduled. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement by Secretary of Import-Export Association Discovered; Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The commercial registration of members of the Import-Export Merchants Association is handled by the Association on their behalf. Recently, the Bureau of Social Affairs received a report that the Association was charging each registered member a handling fee of 40,000 French currency. After investigation, it was confirmed that this was the intention of Zhou Jing, the secretary of the Association, and was not approved by the directors and supervisors. It was found that there was embezzlement in the process. The Bureau has now ordered the Association to dismiss Zhou and recover the funds that have been collected. At the same time, it has issued a notice to all trade associations that they must not charge any fees when handling commercial registration for members.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Representatives Call for Three Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Chen Bisheng and Zhang Weixian, representatives of six Taiwan provincial groups in Shanghai, accompanied Director He of the Ministry of National Defense to Taiwan for the "February 28" incident. They have now returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they hosted reporters at the Youth Association to report on their trip and the current situation in Taiwan, and issued three calls. (1) The authorities are requested to immediately implement the abolition of the Governor-General's Office and the monopoly system, and the promise to change Taiwan into a provincial government. (2) Remove Chen Yi from office. (3) Avoid the use of force against the leaders of the February 28 incident, release innocent arrested people, and guarantee that they will not be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Cleanliness Inspection Completed; Pu Yuan First in the School Group</h3>
<p>The new round of cleanliness competition in the city, Group A (District Inspection Team), Group B (School Group), has ended. In Group A, the results of the inspection showed that the 17th District was the best, and the 3rd, 4th, and 8th Districts were relatively inferior. In the school section of Group B, Pu Yuan Middle School was first, and Xinlu Normal School was the worst. In the primary school section, the primary schools such as Xiaoxue Yuele were quite clean, but some primary schools either due to negligence or due to environmental constraints, the results did not reach the standard. The work of Group C (Organization Group) is in progress and will be completed by the 20th. After the review meeting for the above three groups, the winning silver cups will be awarded. It is also heard that this inspection was conducted in a blitz style, without prior notice, so the judged results are relatively accurate.</p>
<h3>Cheng Rongfang Case Sentenced; Prosecution Not Accepted; Defendant Allowed to Be Released on Cash Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the case of an American sailor stabbing a rickshaw puller, the defendant, Rogers, was sentenced by Judge Lv Shaochang of the local court yesterday morning, and the prosecution was not accepted, and the plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was allowed to be released on a cash bail of 10 million French currency. The reasons for the judgment stated that for crimes that are prosecuted upon complaint, if the complaint has been withdrawn, a judgment of non-acceptance should be made. When the prosecutor filed the case, because the victim's condition was a difficult-to-treat injury, it was considered a serious injury and prosecuted under Section 2 of Article 277 of the Criminal Law (non-prosecution crime upon complaint). However, since the victim's injury has now healed, the prosecutor also stated in court that the legal provisions of the prosecution have been changed. Since it is not a serious injury, this case falls under Article 277, Section 1, and Article 287 of the Criminal Law, which are prosecuted upon complaint. Then, whether the prosecution should be managed depends on whether the victim has withdrawn the complaint. The victim's withdrawal of the criminal complaint has been filed on January 29, and it has been confirmed that the victim, Cheng Rongfang, signed the statement, was not coerced, and was mentally clear, so it is a valid legal act. Judge Wu also stated that for the civil lawsuit part, a private prosecution can be filed in the Civil Court.</p>

<h3>Huge Fire at Warehouse on Sichuan South Road, Burning for More Than Ten Hours, Destroying Large Quantities of Tobacco and Sundries</h3>

<h3>Leniency for Traitors, Opening a Way Out, Judicial Yuan Issues Instructions, May Apply for Parole</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the question of whether convicted traitors can be paroled, the Judicial Yuan has repeatedly received petitions for interpretation from various local high courts. After deliberation by the Yuan's Uniform Interpretation of Laws Conference, the Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. Yuan-Jie-Zi-3358 to various local high courts. The original text roughly stated: "There is no explicit provision prohibiting the parole of traitors. According to Article 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases: Traitor cases shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations; where these Regulations do not provide, other laws shall apply. Therefore, all traitor crimes that meet the provisions of Article 77 of the Criminal Code may apply for parole." According to the original text of Article 77 of the Criminal Code: "Those who are serving a sentence and have genuine remorse may be granted parole after serving more than ten years for life imprisonment, or more than one-half for imprisonment for a fixed term, upon submission by the prison warden to the highest administrative agency of the judiciary. However, this does not apply to those who have served less than one year of imprisonment for a fixed term." According to this, traitor convicts who meet the conditions of Article 77 of the Criminal Code may also be paroled. However, [omitted name] the traitors convicted and detained in Shanghai Prison all have more than one year of [omitted name], so the "parole" provisions cannot be applied.</p>
<h3>Bodies of Eleven Found in Giant Aircraft Crash in Zhabei, Names of Victims Identified</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The B-24 type giant aircraft of the 8th Air Group of the Air Force crashed near Guanyintang House on Hutai Road, Zhongshan Road, in this city the day before yesterday evening after coming to Shanghai from Guangzhou. All personnel on board [omitted name] were killed, and one civilian house was crushed, killing one woman and one child.

<p>Yesterday, a total of eight bodies were unearthed, bringing the total number of deaths to thirteen, including the three bodies unearthed the night before and the two people crushed to death in the shantytown. Their names have been identified as Zhu Yaodong, Dong Chaosheng, Lv Guang, Rong Yinzhang, Guo Yongsheng, Qu Bingjun, Yang Shengquan, Zhao Yingjie, Kong Lihua, Kong's fiancée, and a mixed-race pilot. The wife of the shantytown manager Guan, [omitted name] Shi, and Guan's daughter, Fa Hua.

All the bodies have been sent to the International Funeral Parlor for funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>The four-engine giant aircraft arrived over this city at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, when the weather suddenly changed, with low clouds and poor visibility, making it impossible to find the landing target. At that time, it inquired to the ground by telegraph, and although the ground staff at the airport gave instructions, it still failed to land safely, and then lost contact. It crashed to the ground with a loud noise at around 5:00 PM.

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Queries</h3>
<p>Absconding with Funds</p>
<p>Lu Zixiang asks: There are two legal questions, please answer them: (1) My cousin found out that her fiancé has a venereal disease after the engagement. Can she request to dissolve the engagement and pursue compensation from the man? (2) A certain B absconded with 5 million yuan of legal tender from the merchant shop he serves. The shop owner pursued compensation from his recommender, a certain A. But A is also unable to repay. I wonder if it is possible to negotiate compensation with B's family. Can B's family's farmland be seized to offset the debt? Also, because there was no evidence when B absconded, can the merchant shop testify?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) If your cousin's fiancé has a serious incurable disease, or has venereal disease, or other serious illness, the woman can dissolve the engagement according to Article 976, Paragraph 1, Item 4 or Item 5 of the Civil Code. According to this provision, when the engagement is dissolved, the non-negligent party may request the negligent party to compensate for the damages suffered as a result, according to Article 977 of the Civil Code. The engagement gift, except for ornaments [omitted word] with names, does not need to be returned. (2) After the guarantor has made compensation to the creditor, the creditor's claim against the principal debtor is transferred to the guarantor to the extent of his compensation. This is expressly provided for in Article 749 of the Civil Code. A can pursue compensation from B. If B is an adult, his parents are not responsible. As for the immovable property in his home, if it is solely owned by B, he can request the court to seize it after filing a lawsuit. There is no problem for the merchant shop to testify.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanchang on the 15th] The student unrest at Zhengda University turned for the worse after the Student School Protection Committee presented four answers to Cheng Qibao, a commissioner from the Ministry of Education, on the 15th.

However, the answers presented today are unreasonable, and the government is now difficult to tolerate. He said: Since being dispatched to Jiangxi to mediate the student unrest at Zhengda University, more than a week has passed.

If they resist the school's regulations to resume classes, they will be disbanded and will not be tolerated. Cheng also stated: The students have lost a good opportunity for mediation.

<h3>Textile and Construction Company and Private Cotton Mills Request Adjustment of Cotton Yarn Price Limit, Mutual Sales Within 3.65 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] The China Textile and Construction Company held a board meeting yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs personally attended and presided over the meeting. Wang Yangxian, Ouyang Lun, Yang Xiren, Shu Zizhang, Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Wang Hui and others attended. The agenda was as follows: (1) Report on the company's production situation in the past year and the recent production and sales situation. (2) The company has a total of 200,000 yarn spindles in Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Andong and other places. Currently, 100,000 spindles have been put into operation. The important personnel of each factory will be assigned by the board of directors separately. (3) The company's policy of being handed over to private companies has been determined in principle. However, whether to adopt the method of issuing stocks or bidding will be decided by the planning committee of state-owned enterprises being handed over to private companies. (4) The company strives to start purchasing domestic cotton to supply raw materials. Up to now, it has purchased about 1 million dan, and hopes to purchase another 300,000 to 400,000 dan. In addition, it is still necessary to supplement about 350,000 dan of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that the Textile and Construction Company and various private cotton mills have recently requested the Textile Control Committee to increase the price limit due to the rising cost of cotton and the fact that the yarn price has not been adjusted. It has recently been decided by the Textile Control Committee that the yarn price will be based on 20 counts as the standard. The price of the Textile and Construction Company was originally 2.5 million yuan, and it is proposed to increase it to 3.25 million yuan. Private cotton mills can mutually sell within 3.65 million yuan. This price has now been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and it will be promulgated and implemented after approval.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The price negotiation group meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association was held at the Textile and Construction Company around 11:00 AM yesterday. After discussion, a preliminary decision has been made on the purchase price of cotton yarn in March. It is reported that the highest price of 20-count standard yarn has been set at 3.0 million yuan. This price negotiation will be submitted to Chairman Wu for deliberation by Wang Zijian. In addition, it was decided that the factory price for private factories to trade freely will be calculated based on the cost price plus legal profits. The highest price of 20-count standard yarn has been set at 3.99 million yuan. The above prices will be submitted to the Textile Control Committee's extraordinary meeting tomorrow for discussion and approval, and then handed over to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Beijing for final approval.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Re-Appeals: Rescind the Ban on Shipping Yarn and Cloth South</h3>
<p>The ban on shipping yarn and cloth south has been repeatedly appealed by the six district textile associations to the Textile Control Commission, but the Commission believes that the market price of cotton yarn has not stabilized, and rescinding the ban would inevitably stimulate prices, so the request has not yet been approved. Now, the six district associations argue that the price of cotton yarn purchased is no longer sufficient to cover costs, and sales of yarn from various mills are being hindered, making it even more difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, they have restated their reasons and requested the Textile Control Commission to lift the ban. It is said that the Textile Control Commission has turned to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The reasons for requesting the lifting of the ban are recorded below: It is found that the previously promulgated ban on the southward transport of cotton yarn and cloth was based on government measures at that time, originally intended as a temporary expedient measure due to unstable price fluctuations, and not a permanent national policy. In September of last year, this association reported the difficulties of various yarn mills and the urgent need for yarn and cloth in South China, requesting the revocation of the ban. Subsequently, in November of the same year, it was decided in consultation to purchase half of the cotton yarn produced by private yarn mills. The attending members also exchanged opinions verbally, agreeing that when the purchase of cotton yarn was implemented, the ban on southward transport would be lifted at the same time. Now that the purchasing work has been realized, and the inventory in various ports near Shanghai is sufficient, it is enough to supply the market. At present, sales in the Shanghai market are sluggish, and the market price of cotton yarn is also stabilizing. However, according to the current prices, they are not sufficient to cover costs, and the sales of various factories are blocked, resulting in a sharp reduction in income, while current expenses are difficult to reduce in the short term. Faced with the difficulty of this imbalance of income and expenditure, they will inevitably suffer suffocation and sit and wait for death. There is an urgent need for yarn and cloth in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. The government should originally take into account the people's livelihood, make overall plans, and should not bear to see the people of the South without clothes to cover their bodies, and especially should not bear to see private yarn mills cut off from survival. Therefore, the cancellation of this ban should not be hesitated any longer, lest it be too late to save the situation. A special request is made to maintain the original resolution and immediately revoke the ban in order to maintain the industry.</p>
<h3>Yarn Mills Purchasing National Cotton, Waiting Quietly for Four-Bank Loans</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Council of Shanghai previously proposed that yarn mills should purchase as much Pudong "Fire Machine" cotton as possible to promote the economy of cotton farmers. The Textile Control Commission has consulted several times, in addition to sending a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to promptly supervise the improvement of cotton seeds, and also ordered the Textile Construction Company and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association to instruct various factories to use national cotton as much as possible when spinning coarse-count yarn. If funds are needed for the purchase, the proposed purchase quantity can be reported to the association, so that it can negotiate mortgage loans with the Four-Bank Joint Office on behalf of the mills. Currently, the companies planning to purchase cotton are: China Textile Construction Company planning to purchase 20,000 to 30,000 dan, Weichang 200 dan, Hengchang 1,000 dan, Hengda 3,000 dan, Hengtong 6,000 dan, Daxin 1,200 dan, Huaxin 1,000 dan, Hailin 3,000 dan, Qin Yi 1,000 dan, and Shenxin's planned purchase quantity has not yet been determined. It is said that the above-mentioned factories can start purchasing after the loan has been approved.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. Buyers from Tianjin continued to trade actively, so the 20-count yarn, especially "Hong Kui" and "Tian Nu" brands, were particularly popular. Other counts also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Due to the extreme scarcity of fine yarn, 32-count yarn rose by about 100,000 yuan, and 40-count and above also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Replication Industry, Allotted Yarn Flows into Black Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Manufacturers of Replicated Cotton Fabrics stated that members are not allowed to transfer or trade cotton yarn purchased from the Textile Construction Company in the market. However, such incidents have recently occurred, which may affect the reputation of the industry. It is reported that in addition to notifying all members to strictly discipline themselves, the association has also sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. If any members are found to have illegal activities, they will be reported to the authorities at any time.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters recently discovered a case of off-market trading of yarn and cloth, in which Zhongnan Cotton Weaving Factory sold to Yonglong Cloth Factory, and was handled by a person named Wang, involving a considerable amount. The Yarn Industry Association has reported proof of this to the Economic Group, and the Economic Group will investigate.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales to Out-of-Town Customers Still Strong</h3>

Plain cloth... buyers from Tianjin and other places still made sporadic purchases, and the market remained firm. Among fine cloths, medium-grade goods were still being bought by local shops and factories, so their prices were relatively firm. For example, 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose more sharply than the previous day, with the price being 156,500 yuan. Later, as the Textile Construction Company opened sales of greige cloth as usual, with the listed price of 20-count fine cloth being 2,000 yuan lower than the previous day, people's minds gradually softened. The sales of other twill cloths and Shilin cloths, Anan blue cloths, etc. were sluggish, and price fluctuations were mixed.</p>

Other semi-glossy rayons also saw price reductions of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, due to the continuous declines in glossy rayon. The market situation for factory direct sales remained quiet, with prices generally weak. Ordinary small lots were traded between 6.8 million and 6.9 million yuan, while large lots were sluggish. Comforter covers were not being made, and "Dacheng" checkered crepe was listed at 16,700 yuan, with transactions at 6,500 yuan, but the volume was very small. "Huajin" crepe fell by 200 yuan, and silk-feather yarn saw some sales, with prices stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Official Talks About Not Speculating on Financial Policies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Rumors circulating in the market that the exchange rate will be lowered are unfounded. According to a responsible person from the Central Bank, the Bank's financial policy prioritizes stability. In the past, there has been much speculation about economic and financial measures in the market, which has caused market unrest.

<h3>Approved Merchants' Petition Group Complains to the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Approved Merchants' Petition Group, consisting of Ankang, Heping, Yu Kang, and Tai Feng four banks, and Hong Kang (Xing Ji), Hong Chang, Hong Tai, Heng Jiu, Fu Yuan, and Fu Tai six money shops, yesterday jointly hosted members of the Shanghai press to explain several points regarding the Ministry of Finance's disapproval of their business operations: (1) The four banks are branch offices approved by the Ministry of Finance to be established in Shanghai. The six money shops had suspended operations during the war and had been approved by the Ministry of Finance to resume operations. (2) The Ministry of Finance seems to mistakenly believe that setting up more banks and money shops will fuel speculation and disrupt the financial market. In reality, each bank or money shop requires at least 400 to 500 million yuan in capital. Moreover, due to the relationship of absorbing deposits, it is estimated that the ten banks and money shops can absorb at least several hundred billion yuan of floating capital. (3) The Ministry of Finance has measures to manage banks. If the banks and money shops that have already been approved are found to have businesses that do not comply with regulations, they can be banned afterward. Moreover, during this gold rush, the Ministry of Finance thoroughly investigated the account books of various banks and money shops and determined that they were unrelated. (4) As the government enters the constitutional period, it should complete the legislative process and provide people with some period of consideration. (5) It takes several months, or even more than a year, from the application to the approval of business operations for banks and money shops. After approval, the banks and money shops raise capital, find business locations, and recruit employees, which costs a considerable amount. Once disapproved, the losses are enormous, and the unemployment problem of employees is worrisome. (6) Since approval, the banks and money shops have been actively preparing. Internal business has already begun. Therefore, it is necessary to request the Judicial Yuan to interpret the "opening" of the business as referred to by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Sharp Reduction in Steel Paper Production After Restrictions on Raw Material Imports</h3>
<p>According to a major figure in the steel paper industry, steel paper for packaging is widely used by cigarette factories and candy factories in the city. Among them, the cigarette industry uses it the most. In the past, most of the steel paper used by the factories was produced by the Hua Aluminum Steel Paper Factory and distributed to the factories. However, the factory's main raw material imports have been reduced a month ago, so production is extremely small, and shipments have been stopped for three or four months, causing an extreme shortage of steel paper on the market. Each cigarette factory has plans to abolish packaging. It is reported that the factory is now actively applying for foreign exchange to order raw materials from abroad. As soon as the raw materials arrive, it will continue to increase production to meet market demand.</p>

The market price per set has fallen from 65 US cents to 55 US cents and recently to 43 US cents. It is said that the production cost in Shanghai cannot be reduced, and sausage casing exports are in a stalemate again.</p>
<h3>Coal Merchants Urge the Government to Improve the Rationing Method, Collective Procurement and Sales, and Increase the Quantity</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The majority of the 800 members of the Shanghai Coal Business Association recently stated that the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal to them is not distributed equally. In recent months, it has been in a state of stagnation. At the same time, self-managed coal halls have been bought out at official prices. Therefore, they plan to build a sincere association and request the government to improve two points: (1) If the control still exists, please separate the official and private sectors. The coal used by private factories should be handled by coal merchants, and the government should designate mining areas and approve the quantity. With the association's certification, collective procurement and sales should be allowed, and sales should be made at prices approved by the competent authority. (2) Increase the rationed quantity, continuously month by month, to maintain the livelihood of the coal industry. It is said that the proposal... has been signed and sealed by 800 coal shops, and is prepared to be submitted to the association for discussion today.</p>
<p>Coal Market Lingers on a Weary Path</p>
<p>Sporadic arrivals of Jiaozuo white coal continued, and market prices edged down again. Hong... white coal has recently been in short supply, and sales are unique. Regardless of screened lumps, small lumps, or ash, market prices for all grades have remained firm and stable. The market for bituminous coal is difficult to weaken. Actual sales have absorbed dips, so a turnaround is possible. Arrivals in the charcoal market are too abundant, and market prices continue to fall, already approaching cost. Due to weak actual sales of coal balls, factories have automatically reduced factory prices. Except for Guohua, which is still quoted at 560,000 yuan, Yitaixing and others have reduced prices to 540,000 to 550,000 yuan. In addition to Southern factories which still require 520,000 yuan, other small factories are all at 500,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Truman's Appeal: Request to Congress for Loans to Greece and Turkey, Support for Assisting Free Nations, Full Text of Speech, United States Information Service</h3>
<p>President Truman today (Washington, 12th) delivered an important foreign policy speech at a special joint session of both houses of Congress here, requesting $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey. The President also requested approval to send American public and military personnel to Greece and Turkey to assist in reconstruction work and to oversee the use of American aid.</p>
<p>President Truman stated: In the current gloomy situation, "almost every nation must choose between two ways of life. I believe that the policy of the United States must be to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."</p>
<p>The President then pointed to the Greek civil war and the Greek government's recent note to the United States requesting financial and economic assistance.</p>
<p>The President said: "The very existence of the Greek nation is today threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists, who defy the government in a number of areas, particularly along the northern borders. A commission appointed by the United Nations Security Council is currently investigating the disturbances in northern Greece and the violations of the border along Greece and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, the Greek government is unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is small and poorly equipped. It needs supplies and equipment to restore the authority of the government throughout Greek territory.</p>
<p>Greece Desires Self-Reliance, The United States Should Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Greece needs help if it is to become a self-respecting, self-supporting democracy. The United States must supply that help. We have already extended to Greece certain kinds of relief and economic aid, but these are inadequate. There is no other country to which democratic Greece can turn except the United States. No other nation is willing and able to provide the support necessary for a democratic Greek government.</p>
<p>The British government, which has been helping Greece, can no longer afford to provide financial or economic aid after March 31st. Great Britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in several parts of the world, including Greece.</p>
<p>We have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis. But the situation is an immediate one, requiring immediate action, and the United Nations and its related agencies are not in a a position to extend the kind of help that is required.</p>
<p>Greece has asked us to provide assistance so that it can effectively utilize any financial or other assistance we may give and improve its administrative facilities. This is worthy of mention. Most important, we must supervise the use of the money we give to Greece, ensuring that every dollar is spent in a way that helps Greece become self-sufficient and assists it in establishing a democratic economy.</p>
<p>No government is perfect. The great virtue of a democratic government is that its defects are always visible and can be pointed out and corrected through democratic processes. The Greek government is not perfect, but it certainly represents 85 percent of the members of the Greek parliament, who were elected in elections last year. Observers (including those from the United States) generally agreed that the election was a fair expression of the will of the Greek people.</p>
<p>The Greek government has been operating in an environment of chaos and extremism. The Greek government's measures have often been flawed. Our assistance does not mean that the United States sympathizes with all the past actions of the Greek government. We have condemned and do condemn the extreme measures of both the left and the right. We have advised tolerance in the past and continue to advise it now.</p>
<p>Ensure Turkey's Integrity, Maintain Order in the Middle East</p>
<p>Greece's neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention.</p>
<p>The future of Turkey as an independent and economically sound state is no less important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than is the future of Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself today are very different from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the disasters that Greece has suffered. During the war, Great Britain and the United States provided Turkey with material assistance, but Turkey still needs our support today.</p>
<p>Since the war, Turkey has requested economic assistance from Great Britain and the United States in order to carry out the modernization necessary to maintain its national integrity. The integrity of Turkey is essential to the maintenance of order in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The British government has informed us that, due to its own difficulties, it can no longer provide financial or economic assistance to Turkey. As with Greece, if Turkey needs assistance, the United States must provide it. We are the only country that can provide this kind of assistance.</p>
<p>The United States faces considerable difficulties in providing assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I fully recognize this fact. I would like to discuss these difficulties with you at this time.</p>
<p>A major goal of American foreign policy is to create conditions under which we and other nations can develop a way of life free from coercion. This was the fundamental issue in the war against Germany and Japan. These nations, which attempted to force their will on others, are the nations we have defeated.</p>
<p>To ensure the peaceful development of all nations and to protect them from coercion, the United States has taken the lead in establishing the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is to ensure that all member states can achieve lasting freedom and independence. We cannot achieve our goals unless we are willing to help free peoples maintain their governments and national integrity and resist any aggressive movements that seek to promote totalitarian regimes. In other words, this is also to recognize that totalitarian regimes imposed on free peoples, whether by direct or indirect aggression, undermine international peace and the security of the United States.</p>
<p>Oppose Totalitarian Rule, Eliminate Cunning Tactics</p>
<p>There are many nations and peoples in the world who oppose totalitarian rule, but recently, many totalitarian regimes have been imposed upon them. The United States government has repeatedly protested the acts of intimidation and oppression that violate the Yalta Agreement in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries. I must also state that similar situations are occurring in some other countries.</p>
<p>In the current period of world history, almost every nation must choose between two ways of life. This choice is often not entirely free.</p>
<p>One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, expressed through free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom from political oppression.</p>
<p>The other way of life is based upon the will of a minority, imposed upon the majority by force. It relies upon terror, oppression, control of the press, control of radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedom.</p>
<p>I believe that the policy of the United States must be to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should primarily be in the form of economic and financial aid, which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.</p>
<p>The world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. But we cannot allow changes in the status quo that violate the Charter of the United Nations, such as cunning tactics like political infiltration. In helping free and independent nations to maintain their freedom, the United States will be giving effect to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Destruction of Free Institutions Endangers the Entire World</p>
<p>We only need to look at the map to see that the survival and integrity of Greece are extremely important. If Greece were to fall under the control of an armed minority, it would have a serious direct impact on its neighbor Turkey, and could even lead to chaos throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>But if Greece were to lose its status as an independent nation, it would have a major impact on the countries of Europe. The people of these countries are currently struggling to maintain their freedom and independence in the face of great difficulties, while still repairing the damage caused by the war.</p>
<p>These countries have long struggled against the forces of tyranny. They have made great sacrifices to win victory. It would be an indescribable tragedy to lose the fruits of that victory today. The destruction of free institutions and the loss of independence not only harms them, but also the entire world. This fate will quickly affect other neighboring countries that are struggling to ensure their freedom and independence, making their fate one of despondency, disappointment, and possible failure.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, if we fail to aid Greece and Turkey, the profound implications will extend beyond the East and reach the West.</p>
<p>We must take decisive action immediately.</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend to Congress that it approve a loan of $400 million to Greece and Turkey before June 30, 1948. In making this loan request, I have considered the largest amount that can be allocated to aid to Greece from the $350 million relief fund. This is the sum that I previously requested Congress to approve, the purpose of which is to prevent famine and suffering in countries that have been devastated by war.</p>
<p>In addition to the loan, I request Congress to approve the dispatch of American public and military personnel to Greece and Turkey to assist those countries in their recovery and to supervise the use of the financial and material assistance provided by the United States, as requested by those countries. I recommend that Congress also authorize us to instruct and train selected personnel to go to Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>Invest in Freedom and Peace, Actively and Responsibly Protect</p>
<p>Finally, I ask Congress to grant the authority so that the appropriations it may make can be used most quickly and effectively to supply urgently needed goods, supplies, and equipment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if other funds and authority are needed to achieve the goals described in this message, I will immediately inform Congress.</p>
<p>In this respect, the executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate and unite.</p>
<p>The path we are taking is extremely serious. I would not be making this recommendation if the alternative were not even more serious.</p>
<p>The United States spent $341,000,000,000 to win the Second World War. This was an investment in world freedom and world peace.</p>
<p>The aid to Greece and Turkey that I am recommending costs just slightly more than one-thousandth of that investment. It is just common sense that we should protect this investment and ensure that it is not squandered.</p>
<p>The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by hardship and want. These seeds spread and grow in the poor soil of poverty and struggle. When the hope of the people for a better life disappears, the seeds of totalitarian regimes reach full maturity. We must keep that hope alive.</p>
<p>Free peoples around the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedom. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.</p>
<p>I am confident that Congress will face this responsibility with great courage.</p>
<p>Truman's Demeanor During Speech</p>
<h3>Crowds Rolling! Silver Dollars Dancing! Reno: Gambler's "Paradise" Reno Aviation News, February 24</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>There are four major "gambling nations" in the world: Gibraltar, supported by the British; Morocco, run by the French; Macau, controlled by the Portuguese; and Reno, organized by the Americans themselves. I was in Switzerland two years ago and saw the gambling dens across the river from Locarno on the Swiss-Italian border. At the time, I deeply lamented the appeal of "gambling." Many European princes, politicians in exile, and wealthy tycoons gathered in that small space, tirelessly day and night. After spending four days in Reno this time, I realized that the high-stakes gambling in this kingdom of capitalism is even more astonishing.</p>
<h3>Doors Unlocked at Night, The Sun Never Sets</h3>
<p>Stacks of silver dollars piled up like small hills, long tables, round tables, square tables, all packed with people, the indoor lighting shining like daylight, and dazzling hostesses welcoming customers for the casino bosses. In the smoky, noisy space, one only sees silver dollars dancing non-stop. Radios broadcast soft music one moment and report the winning numbers of "White Corner Tickets" (lottery tickets) the next. Thousands of men and women concentrate all their mental energy on the wins and losses of those numbers, feeling fresh, interesting, and excited.</p>
<p>Reno is a city where the sun never "sets," a city that never sleeps. Night is the time for the people of Reno to work and celebrate. On the most popular North Virginia Street, neon lights of all colors shine on the smooth, flat, and wide road. The doors of the casinos are never locked, and they have never been closed for a single minute. Moreover, there are never any cases of theft or robbery in Reno. I asked many honest local people, and they all said in unison: Reno is a unique society where "doors are never locked at night."</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues, Prospering From Divorce Cases</p>
<p>I said in a dispatch about "Divorce City": Reno's divorce cases require six consecutive weeks of residency. Six weeks may not be too long, but for those well-fed, idle, and leisured classes, coming to the desolate state of Nevada to handle divorce cases and sitting and waiting for six weeks is not easy to "pass" the time. The seventy-two hotels, one hundred and one bars, fifty casinos, fifteen dance halls, and all kinds of entertainment venues in Reno are mostly parasitic on the basic law of "divorce." According to a Reno news colleague, the importance of gambling is gradually surpassing the basic factor of divorce in the prosperity and development of Reno's city. Because only Nevada has no gambling ban in the entire United States, the provincial government not only does not ban gambling, but also uses all its power to support the prosperity of the gambling industry. Nevada has a population of only 150,000, and Reno accounts for 35,000. Therefore, American gamblers flock to Reno from all directions. These people have nothing to do with divorce. Their interest is gambling, not "sex."</p>
<p>Casino Statistics, Known as the Three Strong, Six Strong</p>
<p>During my short four-day stay, I lingered in the casinos every night. Among the fifty or so casinos, only six are the largest. The people of Reno call them the Big Six; but among these six, only three control the leadership, so they are also known as the Big Three. They all use the title of "Club," the so-called "Three Strong" are the Palace Club, the Harold's Club, and the Bank Club.</p>
<p>The Palace Club has the longest history. Its advertisements are all called with "oldest qualification, best reputation." According to the Palace owner Hao, the Palace Club has been at the corner of Central Road and Commercial Road for fifty-nine years. Inside it has three large roulette machines, three dice-rolling equipment, fourteen "Keno" tables, twelve poker square tables, and a large White Corner Ticket counter. The Palace has 270 employees, divided into three shifts, each working eight hours a day. In terms of the salary expenses of employees alone, the total amount each year is $1.07 million.</p>
<p>Among the employees of the Palace Club, one-third are women. The work of female employees is mostly to control the roulette machines and "Keno" dealers. Their salaries vary, but are at least $90 per week.</p>
<h3>Harold's Casino Owner, Is Reno's Richest Man</h3>
<p>Among the current "Three Strong," the most "energetic" one is Harold's Club. Many people in the eastern and southern United States are thousands of miles away from Reno and have never been to Reno, but they all know about the Harold's Casino. The reason is that the owner, Smith, is good at management and understands the effectiveness of advertising. The roads and railways near Reno are filled with Harold's advertisements. Smith himself told me that his advertisements cover the world.</p>
<p>On the eve of my departure from New York, I met a Greek merchant from Boston, Kostas Corelis. This pot-bellied merchant in his fifties is one of Harold's regulars. He often secretly goes to Reno to gamble for a day or two without telling his wife, and then secretly returns to Boston. Because of his introduction, I had the opportunity to meet that Reno "gambling king" Smith.</p>
<p>Smith received me in a building next to the casino. That was the office of his gambling company, with secretaries and typists. Smith is the last name, his first name is "Lai," about 55 years old, when young, he did not work, and he messed around in California and gradually learned many gambling secrets. Shortly after Nevada's development, he mixed into Reno and opened Harold's Casino. Now he is the richest man in Reno, but he says he is just a manager. I asked him who the real owner of Harold's was, and he replied very cleverly: "My two sons and one daughter."</p>
<p>He wrote down the names of his children for me, the eldest son is called Smith Harold, using the name of the casino, the second son is called Smith Lai, inheriting his own name, and the daughter is called Smith Dorothy. In addition to the daughter, the two sons can inherit his mantle and understand the mysteries of gambling. He said that Harold's has different employees due to different seasons. There are 300 employees in the summer when it is busy, and about 250 employees in the winter when the turnover is smaller.</p>
<h3>Gambling Experts, Train Casino Employees</h3>
<p>He said: Harold's daily salary and expenses for employees average $5,000, and the total annual amount is more than $1.8 million. Harold's currently has 33 gambling tables and 50 to 60 machines. In order to make money, gambling itself must have many techniques. The staff are all "specially trained." After completing eight hours of work, they take one or two hours of classes in rotation. The training class has three gambling experts who are responsible for teaching.</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of Harold's, Smith is quite emotional and quite comforted. He said that it took a lot of effort to open Harold's, and it was finally realized in 1935. When it first opened, "it was very pitiful, there were only two machines in total, and they were used by others!" He said with an infinitely vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>The people of Reno said that Smith is the leader of the local society of "gang organizations," and some people also told me that when meeting him, one should be more careful when speaking. But I see him with a rather kind face. I asked him how much Harold's has a year turnover? How much money can you win? He smiled naively: "This is a secret, I can't tell you!"</p>
<p>"But," he continued, "I can answer you: the total income of all casinos in Nevada last year was 21 million yuan, of which 10 percent was paid to the provincial government. The total turnover of the gambling industry is about 97 times the profit, of which summer accounts for two-thirds and winter accounts for one-third. As for the origin of gamblers, 19 percent are from Nevada, and 81 percent are from various provinces and foreign countries. Foreigners account for about 2 percent, and those from the capital Washington account for about 2 percent."</p>
<p>I don't know if his numbers are completely reliable. When he said it, it was indeed based on evidence. I asked him: Have you ever been to Morocco, Gibraltar, and Macau? He said that he had never been to a foreign country, but he hoped to have the opportunity for an "overseas study."</p>
<h3>Various Gambling Methods: Keno and Roulette</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, I should introduce: Among Reno's gambling varieties, the most common is "Keno," two playing cards where twenty points is the maximum. The next is the thirty-six-number roulette, similar to China's "pressing treasures," where if you bet correctly, you can win thirty-five times, but you can also bet on three, four, five, or even twelve numbers at the same time. Next is dice throwing, which is completely different from Chinese dice. It's a wooden, boat-shaped table, as large as a small fishing boat, with gamblers standing around it. The tabletop is painted with various squares like roulette. Gamblers place money on different squares according to their luck. The gambling hall employees are the "house," and there are two of them, holding sticks like golf clubs, loudly calling out the dice numbers. Gamblers take turns throwing the dice, in the order they are standing. The "house" doesn't throw the dice, showing they have no cheating, but you only see their two sticks, constantly hooking silver dollars game after game. Sometimes, gamblers win, but that's just a minority.</p>
<p>Cantonese Overseas Chinese Love to Play "White Ticket"</p>
<p>I watched for two nights and still didn't understand the winning rules. I only saw two: somewhat clumsy-looking large dice, constantly jumping. Americans, especially returning veterans from the Marines, are quite fond of gambling with dice. The "business" at the dice table is the most prosperous. In addition, the lottery (White Ticket) is also quite lively. Chinese overseas Chinese from Guangdong are most interested in "White Ticket" when they gamble in Reno.</p>
<p>White Ticket is different from the so-called lottery in Shanghai. Chinese lotteries draw prizes only once every half month or month, while White Ticket can draw prizes forty or fifty times a night. Its English name is Race Horse Keno, but in reality, it has nothing to do with "horse racing." It's just a small paper with eighty squares drawn on it. Gamblers use ink pens to randomly select ten squares from the eighty. Bets range from a dime to five thousand dollars, depending on how much you want to bet. The gambling hall draws prizes every twenty minutes, drawing twenty numbers each time. If five of the ten numbers you selected match the ones drawn, you can get double the prize money. If six or seven match, you can get dozens of times the prize money. If all ten match, a fifty-cent ticket can win over two thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Because the attraction is so great, there are many people gambling on "White Ticket." It seems easy, but it's actually complex. In higher algebra, the "probability" can easily calculate the chances of winning, how many in the hundreds or thousands? Out of curiosity, I also tried buying it more than ten times, and only once matched five numbers, winning two dimes from one dime.</p>
<p>The most important point is that in every type of gambling, the opponent is the gambling hall owner, who uses employees to execute on his behalf. Gamblers don't gamble with each other. This is Reno's gambling principle. Their employees all wear very meticulous white uniforms, speak very kindly and politely, and never argue with customers in any situation. Gamblers from all over the world come here and lose money, especially those divorced with leisure class. Their emotions are inevitably bad, spending six weeks in the gambling hall. Although they know they are "giving away money," because the employees are kind and gentle, the customers' spirits are always happy.</p>
<p>Golden Season: More Gamblers in Summer</p>
<p>"One summer eats three winters." Summer is Nevada's golden season. When I arrived in Reno, it was winter. In winter, gamblers aren't very enthusiastic. I suspect many tables have disguised customers sitting at them, who are actually "plainclothes" gambling hall employees.</p>
<p>The most elegant gambling is "Bingo," like playing Go. Many people sit around a large round table playing. The host uses a lottery method, drawing and calling out various numbers. Gamblers put black pieces on the numbers. Whoever fills a straight line first is the winner. The fee for each game of "Bingo" ranges from five cents to twenty-five cents, and the prize money ranges from six dollars to one hundred dollars. The "Bingo" gambling hall is separate and not within the large gambling hall. I saw many American old ladies playing "Bingo" to pass the whole day.</p>
<p>Common Gambling Device: "Slot Machine"</p>
<p>Besides these, there's also a very common gambling device that has penetrated every rural area of Nevada. Its name is Jack Pot, which literally translates to "hand-pulled gambling machine" (slot machine). From the so-called three largest gambling halls to rural grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, bus stations, and airports, they are almost everywhere. Its advantage is that there's no need for an owner to manage it. When customers are happy, they put a five-cent coin in, then pull the "switch" on the side, and the roulette in the machine automatically rolls. If you win, it will automatically drop three, five, or even ten or twenty coins. If you don't win, then the original coin is swallowed by the machine.</p>
<p>How the machine is constructed is a secret. Generally, on average, after pulling it a certain number of times, it won't disappoint gamblers too much, but if you play for a long time, customers will definitely lose everything. It is said that the inventor is now one of the richest people in America. Every year, gambling halls, grocery stores, and coffee shops throughout Nevada earn a considerable amount from "hand-pulled machines." There are machines that cost five cents to pull, as well as those that cost a dime and those that cost a quarter. Although the bets aren't large, they accumulate a lot, so they shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>
<p>I asked gambling king Smith about the invention and manufacturing of the machines. He said he didn't know who invented the machine. However, the machines are made in Chicago, and the factory's name is "Pance," on Indian Avenue in Chicago. Machines are shipped in large quantities from Chicago to Nevada, divided into two types of transactions. Large clubs simply buy them outright, while small grocery stores rent them from the factory, with rental fees varying, some even reaching five or six thousand dollars per year.</p>
<p>Smith continued: It's a pity that only Nevada has opened up gambling, otherwise, that company would make even more money!</p>
<p>Make a fortune, make a fortune. Don't you see thousands of silver dollars spinning in Reno! In this gambling hall where you can't see banknotes, the clanging sound of silver coins flying, the loud sound of number lotteries, and the sighs and shouts of gamblers are all mixed together. People pour in and out like a tide. The various types of cars in front of the club doors are always like flowing water, coming and going non-stop. These people seem to have no worries, no sorrows, no grief, and no melancholy. Who says Nevada's desert is like hell? Who doesn't believe that the "gambling city" of Reno symbolizes paradise on earth? (In Nevada)</p>

<p>Military Training in Schools Should Not Be Stopped</p>
<p>The fact that high schools and above have military training is because our highest authorities want to correct the customs of separating literary and military paths and the entire nation's emphasis on literature over military affairs, to reverse the decline and strive for national survival. It was first trialed in schools in the Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui regions, and later, due to the government's active promotion and the enthusiastic response of the education authorities, it became a trend in the twenty-fourth and fifth years. All youths with blood considered the combination of literary and military, and the combination of skill and virtue as the supreme glory. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge announced their opportunity to serve the country. Whether in the front or rear, carrying the wounded, cooking tea and rice, and in the ranks of returning home, there were traces of them. In particular, the Knowledge Youth Joining the Army Movement advocated by the Chairman, they were even more passionate and responded enthusiastically without hesitation! The great call of ten thousand youths and ten thousand soldiers, who can say that it is not a concrete manifestation of the results of military training in schools? If we review the history of military training in the past ten years, if we speak from a technical perspective, because of the lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, it is still far from our ideal goal. If we speak from a lifestyle and ideological perspective, its success cannot be denied. The art of war says: "Those whose peacetime life is consistent with wartime life survive, and those whose opposite die"; the Prime Minister also revealed to us: "Belief arises from thought, and power arises from belief." The ability of youth during wartime to endure hardship, unite and struggle, and under the leadership of one government, one ideology, and one leader, collectively work together and move forward bravely is by no means accidental! If we divide military training into three departments: technical training, life training, and ideological training, its success or failure, gains and losses, are self-evident. We must not give up eating because of choking and doubt our basic national policy. We should strive to improve in terms of equipment, organization, and personnel, so that it can truly exert the greatest function of mastering command, training, management, and administration, and lay a solid foundation for young people to establish themselves, establish others, establish virtue, and establish merit from the rectification of the academic atmosphere. And supplement the shortcomings of school training with centralized training, then the future achievements will be even more mutually beneficial. If school military training is stopped and only one year of centralized training is given after graduating from high school, regardless of whether this training can be popularized to every knowledgeable youth, even if they can all participate in this training, it can be said to be abandoning the fundamental for the superficial, and fundamentally losing the meaning of incorporating military into learning! As the saying goes: "Schools are a microcosm of the country." Only with healthy schools can we cultivate healthy talents. Only with healthy talents can we build a strong country. To enable the youth of the whole country to be loyal to the nation and shoulder the arduous mission of inheriting the past and forging the future, and building and reviving the country, we must closely coordinate military affairs and education, and then military affairs can exert its effectiveness, and education can achieve the expected results. In this pressing situation and the era of the omnipotence of science, if military affairs are separated from education, it is equivalent to losing the soul; if education is separated from military affairs, it is equivalent to having no backbone. Various European and American countries have added military training in elementary schools, and we only have military training in high schools and above, which, in comparison, is already insufficient. We want to build a country, we want to revive, and we want to maintain the glorious achievements gained through eight years of arduous struggle. Our school military training must not only not be stopped but also strive for its popularization and improvement. (Shu Yue)</p>
<p>Refund of Further Education Fees Should Be Implemented</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper that "the academic further education fees for teachers and staff of municipal schools have been included in the budget by the Municipal Council, and the schools have been ordered to refund the fees collected from students." It shows that the councilors are concerned about the people's livelihood and reducing the burden on parents, which is admirable. However, at present, some municipal schools are still urging students to pay this further education fee, and those who have paid have no hope of a refund. Parents are naturally reluctant to go and ask for it, fearing to hurt feelings. If this is the case, then the municipal schools can still comply in public but defy in private, and refuse to return the money. I would like to ask the Education Bureau to promptly order all schools to return the collected "academic further education fees for teachers and staff" by a specific date, to respect public opinion.

<h3>Notes on Viewing Paintings and Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boju of Zhongzhou is skilled in lyrics and music, and especially good at connoisseurship. His collection of famous calligraphy and paintings has long been famous at home and abroad. The true copy of Lu Shiheng's "Ping Fu Tie" is especially noteworthy, dating back to ancient times. I admired him, but did not get to meet him. Recently, my friend Mr. Xie Zhiliu, together with Boju and Shen Yinmo, met the supervisor. I was invited to see the works he brought recently. I was overjoyed. The next day, I made an appointment to meet Boju again, and got to see several more scrolls. In a hurry, the smoke and clouds passed before my eyes. I've briefly noted what I can remember as a contribution to our conversation.</p>
<p>1.  True Copy of Fan Zhongyan's Small Regular Script "Ode to the Taoist Robe" - Fan Wenzheng's calligraphy is a dramatic treasure in China. It has already been engraved in the Sanxitang Calligraphy Album. The original was brought to Dong Province by Ruzi Yi, and when the Japanese surrendered, Yi was captured by the army. This calligraphy and other treasures reappeared. Looking at its mounting, it is still from the Qianlong period. The outer brocade cover has a light blue background with white patterns. The inner cover is white silk. On the silk, there is a long rectangular shape with a silk double bar of about three inches. Within the shape, there are three lines written in ink, noting Fan Zhongyan's Ode to the Taoist Robe and the fact that it was collated by Minister Zhang Zhao, etc. As for the Ode to the Taoist Robe itself, it is mounted as a scroll. The jade slip on the outside is engraved with the words "Qianlong's Imperial Appreciation" and "Fan Zhongyan's Ode to the Taoist Robe" in clerical script. Fan Gong's calligraphy is leisurely, open, harmonious and quiet, making great use of the technique of dividing the brush. The traces of his brushstrokes at the beginning, ending, and transition points can all be found. Yinmo said, "His free brushwork is extremely far-reaching, but his ending is very tight," echoing what Huang Tingjian said in his postscript, praising it as understanding the ancient methods. I fully agree with the two postscripts by Wen Yuke and Wu Pao. In short, one cannot know the flaws of the Sanxitang engraving without seeing the true copy. This is truly a rare treasure.</p>
<p>2.  Huang Luzhi's Cursive Script Long Scroll - This treasure was also once in the Qing Palace's collection. The jade slip is the same as the one for the Ode to the Taoist Robe. However, there is no brocade cover, which must have been lost. Huang Tingjian's calligraphy completely models after Huai Su's Autobiography, but does not copy his traces. He is also quite self-assured in his postscript.</p>
<p>3.  Mi Fu's Ten Calligraphy Copy Scroll - Mi Fu's Ten Calligraphy are all scattered drafts, not complete from beginning to end. The first two calligraphy are extremely exquisite. In the midst of a strong wind and powerful horses, there is a feeling of strict rules. The brushstrokes of the rest are slightly different from the former. Shen Yinweng believes that it may be calligraphy by Wu Ju that was mistakenly inserted. This is a very insightful opinion. But it does not detract from it being beautiful calligraphy.</p>
<p>4.  Portrait of Ziyun Scroll - This scroll was created by Chen Qinian for Tong Jiuqing and is extremely famous in China. Almost all the famous artists of the early Qing Dynasty wrote poems on it. In the scroll, Ziyun looks very plump, with extremely beautiful eyebrows and eyes. It is a pity that no one has written a text on it based on the psychology of Ellis and Freud. Thinking about it, it is quite funny.</p>
<p>5.  Flower Scroll by the Four Beauties of the Late Ming Dynasty - This is a scroll painted by Wang Bogu for the Four Beauties of the Late Ming Dynasty: Wu Juanjuan, Ma Xianglan, Lin Xue, and Wang ×× (forgotten). Wu painted daffodils, Ma painted daylilies, Lin painted chrysanthemums, and Wang painted winter plum blossoms. It is said to represent the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Before it, there is a joint poem by the Four Beauties, written by Xianglan. After it, there is a postscript by Bogu, titled "Layman Zunsheng."</p>
<p>6.  Dongting Diagram Scroll - This diagram has been painted by many people, from Yun Shouping and Yu Zhiding to several other artists. Each person has one painting. Almost all the famous public figures of the early Qing Dynasty have written inscriptions on it. The Yun Xitang family wrote two inscriptions, one poem and one prose. Nalan Rongruo and Gu Liangfen used the same rhyme to write two lyrics, which Rongruo wrote. They are mounted into four scrolls, which is also a magnificent sight. This is an excellent source of information for studying the author of "Dream of the Red Chamber." I wonder if Mr. Hu Shi, who is now a "pawn crossing the river," still has this leisure and elegance?</p>
<p>7.  Dong Qichang's Small Landscape Scroll - This was also once in the Qing Palace's collection, and had an inscription by Emperor Gaozong recording the years when he had imitated it. Dong Qichang wrote that distant mountains must show height and depth to gain momentum, and clustered trees must show leaning up and down to have emotion. He often used this saying and few people who understood it. It is his proud brushwork. Another paper that is mounted later contains poems by Zuo Taichong and others written by Dong Qichang. It is written in small regular script within an inch and is very beautiful.</p>
<p>8.  Zhao Mengfu's Orchids and Ni Ji's Walking Joint-mounted Scroll - This was once owned by Prince Cheng. The title slip is still in Prince Cheng's handwriting. Both paintings are not large, and are not carefully crafted. But the casual brushwork shows the revealing of natural creation. Zhao Mengfu's orchids seem to be especially prone to wind.</p>
<p>9.  Five-Family Album Scroll of Yuan Dynasty - This scroll is very large, and the names of the five families are no longer remembered in detail. Only remember that there is a plum blossom branch by Wang Yuan. All five papers are ink paintings, all exquisite. One of them has Shen Zhou's collection seal. This is the first time I have seen Shen Zhou's appreciation seal.</p>
<p>10. Zhao Mengjian's Poetry and Painting Long Scroll - This is the former property of Wu Liqian of Nanhai. The title at the beginning of the scroll is written by Liqian. There is a very small painting at the front, depicting several narcissus stems. After that, there are more than ten chapters of poetry written by Zhao Mengjian himself in running cursive script. His poems are full of feelings of loyalty and love, and talk and laugh about the ups and downs of life, self-assertive and unique, forming his own style. After the poems, there is a postscript in clerical script, quoting Bai Juyi to compare himself. I observe that his poems are of a different form than Bai Juyi's, but are not ashamed of Bai Juyi. His writing is both dignified and unrestrained, between Cai Xiang and Mi Fu. Its structure and breath are all of the Song Dynasty. It is not like Zhao Mengfu, who has already opened up the style of the Yuan Dynasty. Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy has truly exhausted his natural talent and learning, and can use the ancient to create the new. Although Zhao Mengjian's calligraphy cannot be said to be beyond Zhao Mengfu's reach, it is definitely not something that Zhao Mengfu can surpass. What is valuable is the spirit of strangeness and boldness on the whole paper, which all comes from ancient methods. If we discuss it in this way, it can be directly said to exceed Zhao Mengfu. The Wu family once hooked and copied this scroll and engraved it in the Haishan Xianguan Album. Today, on the true copy, one can still see the traces of carelessness left during the copying process. Alas, Zhao Mengjian and Zhao Mengfu, the two brothers are hard to tell who is better. As for abandoning the glory of the floating world and establishing the rules of human relations, the so-called shaking one's clothes a thousand feet and washing one's feet ten thousand miles, then Zhao Mengjian is far away from the people! (Recorded by the lamp on March 11)</p>
<h3>Review of Zhao Tongyin's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Bai Yuzhu</p>
<p>Zhao Jun's strengths are seen quite well in landscape paintings. Zhao Jun has always been versed in Chinese painting. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he traveled extensively in the western, southern, northern, and various provinces, so what he painted was definitely not copied from ancient painting books, but took natural objects entirely. Wherever his footsteps reached, his brush and ink reached.</p>
<p>Moreover, he stepped and climbed wherever he saw the most difficult and dangerous places. The peaks of Zhongnan Mountain and Cui Bi, as well as the Yingtai Mountain, etc., all take true scenery. Especially the Zhongnan Mountain painting, is subtle and far reaching.</p>
<p>Jianmen Pass, the number one pass in Western Qin, and the Baocheng Shimen painting, etc., are all boardwalk scenery. The Jianmen painting is surrounded by smoke and clouds, making people imagine. Fang Weng's line about riding a horse in the drizzle is even more poetic.</p>
<p>The Yulei Pass of Guanxian in Western Sichuan, and the Elephant Trunk Stone painting, etc., either see its danger, or see its wonder. The Changdao Temple Waterfall and the Xixin Pavilion painting of Qingcheng Mountain are slightly similar to the scenery of the Southeast. But the Ascending Heaven Ladder is completely different, and it cannot be written by those who have not experienced its danger.</p>
<p>The Hua Mountain painting include Qinkeping, Jade Maiden Peak, and the Canglong Ridge, and the steep mountain road of the Canglong Ridge with cliffs is purely a life-sketching brushstroke, which also has a unique style. As the inscription says, "Two cliffs of iron chains and ten thousand feet of bitter vines."</p>
<p>Other works, such as flowers and plants, are plum blossoms, chrysanthemums, peonies, wisteria, etc., which Zhao Jun is good at. However, the artistic conception of Fangzhushan Yong seems ordinary. There are also a few small landscape paintings, such as the spring colors of Hukou and the white clouds coming out of the mountain, which are all beautiful and worthy.</p>
<h3>Concerning Xu Yian</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Lieya, in his article "Recording Jianjiang's Paintings," praised Mr. Xu Yian as a literary giant of the time, and mentioned that he was on friendly terms with such figures as Taiyan and Zhang Jizhi. Mr. Yian was not one to seek fame, and few knew of him. From what I know, although Master Xu studied the classics, he did not seem to be an adversary of Taiyan. However, his poetic power was unmatched within the country. Yet, even those who knew his poetry were not widespread, so I have written this article to share with readers.</p>
<p>Yian's surname was Xu, personal name Chengyao, courtesy name Yisou, from Tangmo Village in the western part of She County. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations of the Jiawu year of the Guangxu reign, and a Hanlin scholar in the Jiachen year. After the Republic of China was established, he entered Gansu five times, successively serving as the head of the political affairs department of the Gansu Military Governor's and Provincial Governor's Office, and as a Dao Yin (circuit intendant). At fifty, he returned home, closed his doors to study, and never took office again. Last spring, he passed away in his hometown due to illness, enjoying a life of seventy-three years, having lived a life of leisure for twenty years.</p>
<p>When Yian was fifty-three years old, he made a final selection of his poems and published them in six volumes. Today, very few copies remain. His preface roughly stated:</p>
<p>"When I compose poetry, I initially admired Li He and Wen Tingyun, then followed Han Yu back to Du Fu, occasionally glimpsing Tao Qian and Ruan Ji. Among the Song poets, I also took inspiration from Chen Yuyi and Mei Yaochen, with no particular preference, so I resemble none of them in particular. As times change, I only do what suits me, taking what is enough to express my feelings and delight my ears. Zheng Ziyin said he did not think to keep drafts. What about the songs of the laborer? I am also a laborer's song. The joys and sorrows of my life are roughly seen in these, and I cannot bear to discard them, only regretting that there is no one to refine my poems..." The poems written by Yian from the Dingmao to Xinwei years were printed by his friend Wang Jianping, divided into two volumes. The first is prefaced by Jianping. The preface discusses the personality of Yian and the excellence of his poetry, and is quite accurate. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu initially studied Changli's poetry, and his five-character ancient verse could capture its spirit. In his later years, living in the Huangshan Mountains, he gradually embraced a more simple and淡泊 style. Therefore, the poems he created became more leisurely and comfortable. However, within this淡泊, there was still 元之致, with a spirit that was 崿, almost making it impossible for people to grasp. However, when you approached him and spoke to him, he would stutter and not be able to engage in lengthy conversations, exuding an elegant refinement and the air of an ancient gentleman... During the years of Guichou and Jiayin, the western frontier was mostly settled, and Mr. Xu relied on his writing for a living. At that time, Lin Tang of Licheng and Huang Xixian of Wu County were skilled in Yuefu poetry, competing in the desolate region. Mr. Xu's thought and skill were unparalleled, and Lin and Huang did not dare to compete with him. Whenever the pear blossoms surrounded the city, and people gathered for gambling and drinking, the elegance of spring outings was unprecedented in this desolate place. Mr. Xu served as a respected guest in the official's tent, and scholars of the time eagerly sought his advice. Although Mr. Xu restrained his sharp edges, he never showed arrogance, and his clarity was like the Jing and Wei rivers, never compromising. The only ones who shared his unwavering integrity and mutual understanding were myself and Lin Tang..."</p>
<p>Yian entered Gansu five times, and his collection is full of vibrant descriptions of the scenery and customs of Gansu, enough to be considered a chronicle of the border city. Before the Xinhai Revolution, Wang Shutong, Yu Mingzhen, and Chen Shi also enjoyed poetry and wine there. However, they could only write small poems, not comparable to Yian.</p>
<p>Yian spent twenty years in his hometown, writing about the mountains and rivers of Xin'an, and his work was extraordinary. His depictions of the strange pines and rocks of Huangshan were particularly outstanding. Mr. Liu Longquan said that since the beginning of Huangshan, there have been countless poets, but none have been able to match Yian. His high regard can be imagined. Yian's Huangshan poems, numbering in the dozens, are all excellent. For example, one of the four poems "From Ciguang Temple to Wenshu Monastery" reads:</p>
<p>"The path has no five steps straight,</p>
<p>But must face utter emptiness.</p>
<p>A withered cliff protrudes its belly,</p>
<p>Forcing people to have no ease.</p>
<p>Following the footsteps on the ladder,</p>
<p>Gazing at the stone, an inch allows a misstep.</p>
<p>Lowering one's head to forbid other gazes,</p>
<p>Slowly climbing with ropes.</p>
<p>Suddenly straddling the top of the cliff,</p>
<p>Confined to a mere three inches.</p>
<p>The sky wind suddenly fiercely churns,</p>
<p>The cloud shadows deeply blurred.</p>
<p>Further up, the road ends completely,</p>
<p>The cliffs uphold ten thousand rocks.</p>
<p>Rushing springs across barren ridges,</p>
<p>Competing for this monkey's path."</p>
<p>About five miles from Ciguang Temple is a place called Wuli Lan, a traverse along sheer cliffs, extremely dangerous. Above it is Daopowen, a path through chaotic rocks with slippery sand. This poem captures the hardship of the ascent, subtle to the last detail. Another of the four poems "Wenshu Monastery" reads:</p>
<p>"A powerful wind comes breaking through the void,</p>
<p>Driving the clouds, trampling the sky.</p>
<p>Startling waves frighten the eyes,</p>
<p>Rushing stones fall on the shoulders.</p>
<p>The peaks easily change their order,</p>
<p>Suddenly appearing before us.</p>
<p>Seen as a boat emerging from a gorge,</p>
<p>A flash and then gone.</p>
<p>Turning one's head, unexpectedly,</p>
<p>The clouds choke and fill the mouth.</p>
<p>Old pines fight the wind,</p>
<p>Like people competing to spread their hands.</p>
<p>Hundreds of props do not break,</p>
<p>Relying on their thick scales.</p>
<p>The mountain spirit pities them,</p>
<p>Not allowing them to endure for long,</p>
<p>Before we finish our meal,</p>
<p>The rising sun is already peeking at the . "</p>
<p>This poem describes the ever-changing pine trees and clouds of Huangshan, with the vitality of a living dragon and tiger. "Climbing Qingliang Terrace" reads:</p>
<p>"Shaking off my clothes on Qingliang Terrace,</p>
<p>All the wonders begin to enter my eyes.</p>
<p>Steep cliffs rise in solitary splendor,</p>
<p>Looking down, I see ten thousand peaks prostrate.</p>
<p>A pine tree leans on a rock,</p>
<p>With sharp edges like carvings.</p>
<p>The pine resembles the shape of the stone,</p>
<p>The stone also resembles the pine's kin.</p>
<p>Bizarre and unnamable,</p>
<p>Fresh and beautiful, just bathed.</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder, mutually staggered,</p>
<p>Head to head, each solemn.</p>
<p>Like gathering ten thousand horned dragons,</p>
<p>Hiding them in a valley.</p>
<p>I now caress and possess them,</p>
<p>Playing with them as if they were my children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>With a smile, I recognize Huangshan,</p>
<p>Not disappointing these weary feet."</p>
<p>Huangshan encompasses all things, nothing is not wondrous, but the strange pines and bizarre rocks are its defining features. This poem by Yian captures the strangeness of the pines and rocks, leaving people in awe.</p>
<p>Yian's death is truly a great loss to the poetry world. Mr. Chen Tao'an (Baozhen) most appreciated his poetry, believing that such talent was rare in centuries. Not only could his contemporaries not compete with him. Mr. He Meisheng, an old poet from Min County, saw Yian's poems at Tao'an's place and was utterly impressed. One day, while pacing in his small room, he recited aloud, "Cooling the heart like hair, slightly touching a cicada, I know" (凉心如髮，微逗一蟬知), savoring the endless flavor. His disciple, a certain Mr. X, asked him curiously. Meisheng said, "This is a line from Mr. Xu. I saw it recently at Tao'an's place. It truly rivals the ancients, something modern poets cannot achieve." Tao'an and Meisheng rarely praised the poetry of modern people, but they held Yian in such high regard, demonstrating the depth of Yian's skill, certainly not a matter of personal preference.</p>
<h3>Appreciation of Art</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Appreciation of art is not an easy thing. China has five thousand years of civilization, and the pure art that expresses the highest realm of emotion and personality is calligraphy. We can divide historical periods by the evolution of 体, just as Europe divides eras based on changes in architectural style. Chinese painting is a combination of poetry, calligraphy, and painting into one, forming a unique artistic conception, which is different from the European concept of architecture, sculpture, and painting as a trinity. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the Italian painter Giuseppe Castiglione (郎世寧), who served in the inner court, applied Western sketching methods to Chinese silk, emphasizing rendering and outlining, but lacking vivid brushwork and ink interest. Compared to the more modern masters such as Chen Laolian, Yu Zhiding, and Ren Bonian, the value of his artworks is significantly lower. The reason is simple: Castiglione did not understand Chinese calligraphy, which is an important factor.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty painter Zou Yigui criticized Western painting, saying: "The West is good at geometry, so their paintings of light and shadow, distance, are accurate to the smallest detail. The figures, houses, and trees they paint all have shadows. The colors and brushes they use are completely different from those of China. The composition is wide and narrow, using triangles to measure. Painting palaces on walls makes people feel like they want to walk into them. But there is no brushwork at all, so even if it is skillful, it is merely craftsmanship and does not belong to the realm of painting." Zou's criticism of Western painting based on "no brushwork at all, only craftsmanship" is certainly an unreasonable prejudice. It is a pity that he never saw the drawings of Ingres, the masterpieces of Rubens, Vernet, Rembrandt, Goya, and Géricault. Western painting does not lack emphasis on brushwork and touch, which is a fundamental error for Chinese painters who do not appreciate Western art.</p>
<p>The religious art formed by Chinese painting during the Wei, Jin, and Southern Dynasties, and the themes and techniques adopted by ancient Italian painting in Europe, have a tendency to coincide. However, because Chinese calligraphy flourished, poetry developed, and the art of painting was mutually integrated, a special style was formed. Western painting, influenced by the Renaissance and scientific progress of the fifteenth century, focused on the study of light and shadow, and the result was greatly different from Chinese . However, each has its own strengths and values.</p>
<p>The collection and appreciation of artworks has always been a right enjoyed by a special class, with ordinary people rarely having the opportunity to access them. Moreover, there is no establishment of art museums and museums, which leads to the widespread prevalence of forgeries and imitations. Previous artists regarded serving the inner court and being supported by the imperial family as the highest glory, losing the spirit of self-creation and being dominated by objective conditions in their creations, forming a uniform court style.</p>
<p>In recent years, personal exhibitions by artists have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, becoming popular for a time. However, with the exception of a few successful works, there is a tendency to emphasize quantity over quality, reducing the noble sentiments of artists and embarking on the path of utilitarianism. As a result, problems have arisen in the appreciation and creation of art itself. We should rescue this crisis as soon as possible to correct the previous erroneous ideas.</p>
<h3>Professor Kuang Youhan Paints Withered Trees and Bamboo Songs</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>Po Gong (Su Shi) loved to paint trees and stones,</p>
<p>His interest came from books and poems;</p>
<p>How many of his true works can we see today?</p>
<p>We can only imagine his techniques.</p>
<p>Withered trees still have life,</p>
<p>Stones can be turned but never moved;</p>
<p>The robust spirit is vigorous and unconstrained,</p>
<p>Uniquely using Mr. Mo (bamboo) to express it;</p>
<p>The inspiration is high, and the painting is completed as the paper runs out,</p>
<p>The onlookers disdainfully sneer.</p>
<p>Later historians competed to imitate,</p>
<p>To consider this as reality is foolish;</p>
<p>Last night, high pavilions were lit with candles,</p>
<p>As if Hou Shan was seeking verses;</p>
<p>Alas, your painting is still just a painting,</p>
<p>Barely gaining some poetic essence in its concrete form;</p>
<p>I need my friend, and my friend needs me,</p>
<p>Looking at each other, we are great masters who agree;</p>
<p>If Su Shi knew, he would laugh loudly,</p>
<p>Exaggerating and wasting words;</p>
<p>This small skill is not worth mentioning,</p>
<p>Better to tear it up and burn it.</p>
<h3>Preface to Huangshan Painting</h3>
<p>— Shen Ju</p>
<p>Written for the painter Zhu Qishi</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Whether they are officials or hermits, painters of ancient and modern times must be of high character." Li Sixun was a member of the Tang imperial family, but resigned during the reign of Empress Wu and lived in seclusion, amusing himself with brush and ink. Lu Hongyi was repeatedly summoned to court during the Kaiyuan era, but refused to take office, instead building a thatched cottage to live in. Li Cheng of the Song Dynasty was from Chang'an, and traveled and practiced his art without becoming an official. Wu Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty was upright and aloof, painting plum blossoms, fishing father pictures, and writing fishing father poems, which were passed down to later generations. Ni Yunlin built the Qingbi Pavilion to live in seclusion, painting distant mountains and forests to please himself; Huang Gongwang would go three days without cooking, yet he would still sit under a bean arbor with his belly exposed, leisurely painting Mt. Ju. Bada Shanren, Qingxiang Chenren, and the monk Jianjiang, either fled the world as members of the imperial family or lived in seclusion as eminent monks, pouring their emotions into painting; all had lofty ideals, unrestrained and uninhibited. Therefore, their works were all divinely inspired, and vulgarity could not touch their genius. My friend Zhu Qishi of Jiaxing, served as an official in eastern Zhejiang in his youth, and therefore called himself a mountain dweller of Kuocang. He is of proud character and is proficient in all the arts; his seal carving integrates the styles of Anhui and Zhejiang, his calligraphy embodies the spirit of Qin bronzes and Han stone inscriptions, and his landscape painting follows the style of Dong Yuan, without being bound by rules and regulations, and can be said to have reached the realm of divine inspiration. After settling in Nanhu, he devoted himself to the arts, unwavering in his ambition, and became increasingly transformed. During the War of Resistance, he took refuge from the bandits in Tianmu Mountain; and then re-ascended Huangshan Mountain, searching for the beauty of all thirty-six peaks, and putting them all into his painting bag. Coming to the sea, he closed his door and worked on his art. And soon five days will be spent on a river, and ten days on a mountain, Du Shaoling's so-called Wang Zai's true works, who would have thought that it would be viewed today. Zhu has explored the beauty of Huangshan twice, and when he returns, he dreams of it and talks about it with guests, talks about the steepness of Tiandu Peak, paints for people, paints the elegance of Lianhua Peak; it is as if a mountain spirit is divinely assisting him under his wrist, and the clouds and mist fall on the paper, making it unpredictable. As for the fluidity of the breath and the ancientness of the brush and ink, they are just incidental matters. Knowing that I am fond of his travel journals, he invited me to his residence and showed me several paintings, some lush, some desolate, some towering, some steep, facing them is like being in Tiandu and Lianhua, leisurely seeing the sea of clouds rippling, almost forgetting that I am in the midst of worldly temptations. Zhu said: "The Huangshan paintings are not limited to this, this is just a taste of the whole; the others, vertical, horizontal, large, small, total more than fifty, will be exhibited in the Ningbo Fellow Association gallery soon; and his friends Qin Hanfang, Xu Da, and the two poets Lu, will also be exhibiting hundreds of points of historical materials from the puppet Manchu regime in Changchun, for the exhibition; at that time, you should come and spend half a day admiring them." On the day of the event, I will write a small preface to present to him.</p>
<h3>Huangshan Ao Yu (Sea Turtle) Cave Painting</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qishi</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 199</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Ha!" Mizi also mimicked the tone of the混混 (hoodlums) seen, "Then who are you responsible to? Is it to yourself?" This tone was quite impolite.</p>
<p>"You could say that!" Hejian still held his temper, "Because I am ordered by the General Staff Headquarters, and the Kinoye Cabinet. As long as I am responsible to these two organizations and Prime Minister Konoye, that is enough. Others probably won't ask."</p>
<p>"Let me say this, Captain Inoue," Pingzi was always so gentle, "I will be responsible here. The captain can report back to your unit based on what I said."</p>
<p>"Ping...Bang, bang, bang..." The signal was sent for the second time. Judging from the sound of the guns, our team was very close. As soon as the signal was sent, suddenly signal guns were heard simultaneously from all directions. Before the signal gunshots ended, all kinds of gunshots rang out at the same time, rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns set up outside the door, all firing. The two sides had officially come into contact.</p>
<p>"Hey..." Hucheng didn't know what he had discovered, and suddenly shouted softly.</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask Hucheng, but it was too late. I saw the large light bulb suddenly go out. Inside the door, voices and gunshots were noisy, truly like a boiling cauldron, in a chaotic mess. Before my eyes was a pitch-black darkness. Not to mention "reaching out and not seeing five fingers," you couldn't even see your own hands. Standing here, I was as if I had lost my footing and fallen into a deep abyss.</p>
<p>"Miss Yaoxun! ...Hucheng!..." I shouted a few times, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>At the same time, I heard voices and gunshots mixed together, footsteps mixed with each other, and that fake female tiger, roaring loudly, like a wolf howling. The roar gradually went away, probably running outwards while roaring, and what she was roaring, I couldn't hear clearly.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to grope forward to find Hejian, suddenly a strong beam of light shot out from the corner of the big room, like a searchlight, sweeping horizontally, stopping beside me, and then suddenly went out.</p>
<p>"Secretary General!" A rough voice shouted from not far away.</p>
<p>Hearing this voice and the half-mountain, half-Japanese accent, I knew it was "04."</p>
<p>"Secretary General,... everyone is gone!... "Hearing the sound of this speaking, I knew that "04" was walking towards me.</p>
<p>"Did everyone go out to participate?" I asked "04" in the direction of his voice.</p>
<p>"I can't say... some went upstairs, some rushed out of the gate."</p>
<p>"Did you see our captain?" I was most concerned about Hejian, because his situation was too peculiar, too complicated; "And that Miss Pingzi?"</p>
<p>"Went upstairs," the fool answered.</p>
<p>"Miss... Miss Yaoxun and Hucheng?"</p>
<p>"Also went upstairs."</p>
<p>"What about their captain and the two guests?" This was referring to Mr. W, Mr. Dai, and Secretary Ma.</p>
<p>"Probably also went upstairs."</p>
<p>Getting these reports, knowing that they had all gone upstairs, I of course had no need to stand here. Outside the door was the firing line, probably stray bullets were flying around, and I also had no need to go out; besides, my eyesight was poor, so I might not be able to see anything. I decided to go upstairs too.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Civil War and Butterflies</h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<h3>Another Case of Collusion Between Officials and Merchants</h3>
<p>— Changkong</p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone expresses dissatisfaction with the status quo, shaking their heads at everything, expressing helplessness and discouragement, as if all they see before them is a darkening mess.</p>
<p>For example, the thorough investigation of the Gold Tide case, as of the fourteenth, only revealed that participating in the Gold Tide malpractice was another old trick of "collusion between officials and merchants."</p>
<p>Previously, grain loans caused a storm due to collusion between officials and merchants, but now the Gold Tide case, which has caused Shanghai's prices to rise by 100 percent, is once again the work of "collusion between officials and merchants"!</p>
<p>Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren are both key members of government-run banks. They use their power to secretly sell and buy gold bars, manipulating the power of life and death of finance on the one hand, and disrupting finance by taking advantage of the gaps in their authority on the other. As Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Department said, Lin and Yang secretly colluded with merchants, privately exchanged benefits, used external organizations to manipulate gold, breathed through the same nostril as corrupt merchants, and manipulated things from above and below.</p>
<p>Now Zhan Liansheng, chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, has been arrested, but Lin and Yang are still out on bail. The Gold Tide case is now being strictly investigated by the highest authorities, and we also hope that Lin and Yang should be immediately sent to the judicial authorities for strict punishment.</p>
<p>American journalists often criticize China's bureaucratic politics, bureaucratic capital, and collusion between officials and merchants; and severely punishing the malfeasance in the Gold Tide case is enough to wash away the international community's perception of China's political status quo!</p>
<p>Look: isn't the Associated Press again harshly criticizing the privileges that bureaucratic capital has in Chinese commercial firms?</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying that goes: "As long as you sit upright, you don't have to worry about the monk and nun sharing a bench!"</p>
<p>Whether people criticize our bureaucratic politics or bureaucratic capital, as long as the highest authorities are upright and impartial, and punish a few "officials and merchants" and "neither officials nor merchants" like Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren according to the law, not only can the rumors of international friends be quelled, but also the resentment of the people can be suppressed.</p>
<p>The myriad threads of Chinese politics can be summarized in this one point. We should quickly establish a legal system, not centered on people, and prevent those who wield great power from arbitrarily doing evil!</p>
<p>The participation of official members in the Gold Tide case is a prominent example.</p>

<h3>Darwin Guessed Right: Coral Reefs are Sunken Islands</h3>
<p>— Yan Tong</p>
<p>Scientific progress can sometimes be surprisingly slow! Darwin had a theory 110 years ago that has only now been confirmed by the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>In 1831, Darwin was just a young naturalist, sailing on the famous voyage of the Beagle. As he crossed the South Pacific, he was fascinated by the ring-shaped coral islands. He wondered: How could these saucer-shaped corals suddenly grow out of such a deep ocean? Why are they ring-shaped? How are they formed? Everyone knows that corals don't thrive more than a few (one = six feet) feet below the surface of the water, so the coral reef must not have grown up from the seabed. So Darwin concluded: coral reefs are caused by the sinking of islands. After sinking, the corals growing on the shore continued to grow, forming the atolls we see today.</p>
<p>This theory was widely accepted, but it was never proven until the U.S. Navy decided to test two atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll last year. Scientists used seismic methods to map the structure of the atoll, using 126 deep-water explosives to explode at various locations on the bottom of the atoll. During the explosion, sound waves passed through the coral and the material below. The more solid the material, the faster the sound waves passed through. By recording the order in which the various sound measuring instruments received the sound waves, scientists could estimate the density of each stage of the rock.</p>
<p>They found that above 2,000 feet below the surface, the coral reef was made of coral or similar material. Below that was a harder rock, probably volcanic ash from previous eruptions, or limestone of coral or other marine animals that had been compressed. At about 5,000 feet, they finally found what they were looking for: a buried mountain.</p>
<p>This may be the center of the volcano, a relic of erosion. The details can only be known by drilling. But in any case, the mountain is there, far below where the corals grow. Darwin guessed right on the deck of the sailing ship. (Translated from Time Magazine, January 13)</p>
<p>Drama Talk</p>
<h3>Speaking of Sheng Lan and Zhenfei Listening to Pine</h3>
<p>— Tingsong</p>
<p>"Gaining Triumph at the Rainbow Pass" is close to being a popular and excellent play. Ye Sheng Lan is the most outstanding in his role, while Jin Zhongren and Cheng Jixian are both elegant and refined, truly embodying the style of their predecessors, but it is a pity that only those who know can appreciate them. Jiang Shengren's "Miao Xiang" has also changed his profession. He has been acting with Wan Hua for the longest time, but recently, he has become famous for playing Yang Zongbao's tour of the camp in "Visiting Mother." Those who sing Xiaosheng (young male roles) nowadays all follow his style, which is strange. Sheng Lan is the pride of the Xiaosheng actors of recent times. He opens up a new record by having a Xiaosheng take on the main role. Chen Shengtai, Chu Yindu, and Xu Hecai are all rising stars. Yu Zhenfei is the son of the master of opera. He became a professional actor as a famous amateur, and he is determined to perform in operas. He is actually an indoor disciple of Jixian. However, Zhenfei is truly an unprecedented talent in Kun Opera. His voice and appearance are both beautiful. Even if Xiao Xiang were to rise from the underground, he would probably only be equal to him. It is a pity that elegant music is lost, and no one is able to match him. Even Mei and Cheng can only perform "Qi Shuang Hui" with him, which is a masterpiece of "chuichang" (blowing tunes). If it is a formal Kun Opera, such as "Stealing Poems" and "Qin Tiao," it can only be said that there are many women. Only in the new play "Chun香 Dream," is he delicate and well-suited to the role, and his movements are coordinated. He and Yushuang match each other, truly capturing the ethereal and vague atmosphere of a dream. It is truly a satisfying work. I admire his talent, and I lament his fate. The latter half of this article should not be included in the "Remembering the Past" record. However, because Xu and Yu are both from Wu (Jiangsu and Zhejiang), and because Xiao Xiang opened the stage, I cannot but make Zhenfei the last general, so that they can shine together, fully expressing the meaning of the beauty of Xiaosheng.</p>
<h3>Three Doctors in "Golden Stone Vow"</h3>
<p>— Xun Jie</p>
<p>Doctor Tao Hua knows very well that Pan Li is a smart and self-respecting child with a promising future. At the same time, he also understands the love between him and his own daughter, but because his wife suffers from insanity, which has been passed down to his daughter and affected the development of his career, he does not want to see a promising young man embark on his own path. He does not want the seedlings he has cultivated to be harmed, and finally, in a struggle between reason and pain, he poisons his daughter, kills himself, and leaves all his property to Pan Li.</p>
<p>Doctor Gordon, for the sake of his daughter's love, harbors hatred for Derek's dissolute behavior. Finally, taking advantage of an opportunity, he amputates his unnecessary legs. He wants to turn this young man into a cripple both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Pan Li studied medicine in Vienna and, after graduating, heard that a childhood friend had had his legs amputated. He rushed back to his hometown, not only giving his friend his own property, but also trying his best to heal him psychologically, so that he would not feel like a cripple. In the end, he succeeded.</p>
<p>Here we see the typical good and bad doctors.</p>
<p>Doctors are saviors who free people from the sea of ​​suffering. They undertake the holiest and most active work. They should discern what is the doctor's responsibility and what is true salvation and love for others. If they indulge their own selfish desires and vent their personal grievances, then this is the most despicable and shameful thing in the world.</p>
<p>In this dark society, who can guarantee that there are no doctors like Gordon?</p>
<h3>Literary Clouds</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>The woodcut artist Liu Xian recently wrote a letter to a friend in Shanghai from Beiping, saying: "The literary and publishing scene in the Beiping-Tianjin area is very quiet. There is a sense of cold weather and people being lazy to start. Although it is now entering early spring, the north wind is still howling, and the land is still frozen."</p>
<p>The fourth volume, third issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn," edited by Fan Quan, titled "New Talent Recommendation Issue," has now been published, featuring eleven short stories by new writers. "Intermediate Generation" is particularly valued by critics.</p>
<p>Zhou Erfu is currently rewriting his play "Soldiers' Sons" after arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Straining Every Nerve</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>In today's society, although there is an item called "additional work without additional pay," whether it actually exists is unknown.</p>
<p>Based on what I have heard and seen, and what I have understood in my heart, I dare to say boldly: The vast majority of people take on "additional work" precisely for the sake of "additional pay." Because only by taking on additional work can they work from sunrise to sunset and still not rest. Only then can they support their parents and provide for their children without shame.</p>
<p>A friend who works in the "nightlife" industry has started taking on additional work this semester, becoming a professor at a certain university during the day. He is used to telling the truth, "My crashing through the doors of the university and sitting on a cold bench is only in the hope of receiving some daily necessities rations. Otherwise, I wouldn't be happy to strain every nerve!"</p>
<p>"Straining every nerve!" This is a heart-wrenching cry! His burden is heavy, and it is not difficult to imagine him trembling on the cliff of life. He knows that his academic ability is more than enough, but his physical strength may already be failing. However, he has no choice but to "crash in," working day and night like an ox or horse. He also knows clearly that in a few years, perhaps even his strong flesh will no longer exist, and he will not even be able to find the capital to struggle with sweat and effort. If he delays any longer, he will not even have the strength to "jump out" again. He must "crash in" in time, and he can no longer worry about anything else! However, after straining every nerve, who can give him life? This is why he trembles before life.</p>
<p>The philosopher Nietzsche said: Humans are no different from golden-haired beasts. The writer Mao Dun pointed out that Chinese people (referring to coolies) seem to be livestock carrying heavy loads. In the journey or adventure of life, I think everyone will inevitably "crash into" a place sooner or later. As for what place they crash into? I think it's nothing more than a pit.</p>
<p>That day, a friend and I went to see "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon." What was frightening was that the shadow of the pit was inadvertently imprinted on our hearts. Regardless of whether we are higher than the protagonist in the play on the stage of life, the distance between each other and the pit is equally close. When the movie ended, he sighed deeply: traveling eight thousand miles only to discover a pit!</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Lao Zhu finally realized that someone was watching him, so he interrupted his speech and turned his face away.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you?" He couldn't be as calm as that young woman. As soon as the other person's face came into view, he jumped up, widened his eyes, and exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's me, that's right. Zhaonian," the young woman replied softly.</p>
<p>Xu Fatty glanced at them sideways.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhu, have you known each other for a long time? This is my cousin, she just came from Shanghai, and happened to encounter the escape," the host said as if introducing them.</p>
<p>Neither of the guests spoke.</p>
<p>The young woman deliberately turned around, walked to the window, sat on a small wooden chair, forced a very unnatural smile, in order to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>"Oh! You are relatives," Zhu Zhaonian said blankly. "I didn't see you when I came yesterday."</p>
<p>"They arrived last night. Thanks to you, Cousin!" Xu Shaoming was very happy to have this interlude, unexpectedly interrupting Lao Zhu's complaints. "They took a lot of detours, coming from the Pingshi side. Lao Zhu, my cousin is really capable, she even brought two children!"</p>
<p>"Two children? So, you already have children?" Zhu Zhaonian asked miserably, forgetting his concerns for a moment.</p>
<p>"It's been a full eleven years! How could there be no children?" Lan replied quickly, not giving Xu Shaoming a chance to notice the affectionate address that Lao Zhu used.</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming drank the glass of cold tea in front of him like a cow.</p>
<p>"Second Cousin, how do you know Lao Zhu?" he asked, looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"We met when we were running the Youth Drama Troupe," Zhu Zhaonian answered the question for the young woman.</p>
<p>"Oh! That's right, that's right! You had many girlfriends when you were in school!" Xu Shaoming vaguely remembered something. However, although he and Lao Zhu studied together, their interests were completely different, and they rarely interacted on weekdays, so he did not know the details.</p>
<p>"Why did you come in at this time, and why did you bring the children?" Lao Zhu could no longer put on a smiling face. "Are you still planning to live in Guilin? Where is your husband?"</p>
<p>The young woman slowly wiped the sweat from the tip of her nose with a small handkerchief, without answering immediately; her emotions were also greatly agitated. (15)</p>
