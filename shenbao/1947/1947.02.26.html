<h3>谷壽夫二度受審　被告申請引渡證人來華被駁斥　定下月三日續開辯論庭</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕南京大屠殺案主犯谷壽夫，廿五日第二次公審，開始辯論，九時開庭，仍由石美瑜擔任審判長，業晚始畢，全部辯論未畢，定三月三日續行辯論。</p>
<p>小笠原青供詞</p>
<p>谷犯押解抵庭時，神色一如往昔。當由庭長宜稱；被吿前要求准引渡日籍證人下野，田邊，板磯，柳川等，來華作證，因彼等均曾參加作戰，無作證價值，申請駁回，决訊問小笠原，對於小笠之參加作證，及為何能明瞭大屠殺案情形，詳加詢問。小笠原答以過去在日本讀陸軍大學時，即研究攻南京之經過，旋被派至南京作參謀，至雨花台等防區後，證實其研究無訛，再詢其「谷壽夫是否首先入城？」答以中山門先行突破，然後始為中華門。此時谷犯再提出要求，准予調傳日籍證人，否則將無公正裁判。庭長稱：被吿部隊究對大屠殺案負責否？南京被殺卅餘萬人，被吿是否有責，本庭尙未裁判，何能謂不公正？</p>
<p>署城事實一斑</p>
<p>旋再提出一有力證據，乃由海軍總司令送到，現在陸軍大學之郭歧所著「陷都血淚錄」一書，其中所寫，　局屠城事實，郭為參加作戰而彼力學哥南京，三日始能逃出，其中殺害情形，約如下述：（一）迫市民卅餘人入結冰之池塘捉魚，如從之則入池即被凍死，不從則被殺；（二）將一老人以繩吊於樹上，以之作靶子，將老人槍殺；（三）日軍强姦一女人後，復促其子强姦其母，並在其旁鼓掌歡笑；（四）一十七歲之女子，扮男裝出城被察出，即進行輸姦，同時有中國人走過，即令此四人姦之，四人不從，正哀求間，一和尙過，當令此和尙姦之，和尙不從，即以刀殺死；（五）日軍每至深夜，輒三五成羣，越安全區，住宅，踰牆而入，進行强姦，是謂「摸魚」！（六）故意引誘婦女出來，然後至晚間至其住處强姦，此謂之釣魚。旋傳郭歧，訊其當時目睹經過。</p>
<p>日軍暴行調查</p>
<p>繼經庭長宣佈國際委會調查之日軍暴行，共計四二五案，其他被集體屠殺者有十九萬人，零星屠殺者十餘萬人，有案可稽者八一六起，中華門一帶共三六八案等，谷犯狡辯謂，當時正在激戰中、中華門一帶根本無居民，女人更不必提。庭長即詢以你可以保證你在南京期間，沒有殺過　個人？谷犯無詞以答，時己十二時，即宣佈休息。</p>
<p>谷犯一味狡辯</p>
<p>下午二時繼續開庭，谷犯首先答辯，長達兩小時，全部狡辦，綜合其意：（一）地區方面不在其防區內，（二）時間方面因在激戰期中，無居民，不會發生屠殺事件等，以七點辯，隨時以「揑造」，「不眞實」，「緩昧」，「故意偽造」為形容詞，並侮　我法庭，稱此種不公正之審判為全世界所未見。最後再提出必謂柳川犯，乃一神聖之事，如此情形，簡直是一污點，被告決不能心甘　服。全部辯詞中，「是時中華門一帶正在激戰中，根本沒省人，不可能發生這種事！」一句，覆述達十一次。庭長即停止其發言。</p>
<p>律師主處極刑</p>
<p>繼由辦人梅祖光律師代為申辯，略稱：被吿係部隊長官中之一人，不能以大屠殺之罪由被吿一人承之，不可謂為破壞和平及遠反人道罪。末由檢察官陳光虞答辦其所狡辯各點，大要如次。各犯以下列數點為辦白：（一）率會來華，（二）軍紀良好，（三）大屠殺案事先不知，（四）丕任其防區，（五）暖昧不確實，（六）是時中華門根本無人等，但（一）達法之命令，是不應服從的，（二）如被吿軍耙良好，又何人軍紀不好？（三）南京被殺達三十餘萬人，被吿是否應負其責？（四）防區是否事先劃定？有無命令？有無證件？（五）我們所提證件毫無做偽，故被吿實犯違反人道罪，被壤和平罪，戰學罪，主張處以極刑。時已六時，庭長宣佈定三月三日下午二時續行辯論。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>對於國民敎育經費的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>最近南京教育家舉行一個集會，專門討論國民教育經費一事，我們深深感到國民教育經費已到山窮水盡，國民教育已瀕破產的邊綠。我們眞想不出為什麼最亟需教育的中國，教育如此不振，蔣主席曾大呼「教育第一」；對於行憲則曰「第一，必須行使政權的人民具有掌握政權，確保政權的能力和習慣」，而這種能力和習慣必須普及教育來培養，才不致受野心家左右，才可避免治權侵犯政權。行政首長才能受人民的監督，由人民定去留。無論抗戰或建國，無論一黨政治或多黨政治，不可缺少的大前提是受過教育的民衆。教育上有了均等機會，人人受了敎育，國家社會才有現代化的基始基礎。</p>
<p>我們可惜經濟財政政策的脆弱，更可惜教育政策雖有而等於無。國民教育由貧血狀態而陷入壞血微象，不但無力滋養培助，甚或有意無意中時加　殘。我們廳各專家的報告　論，實在够我們發愁。遜淸的小學教育經費，一部份來自學由學產，山勸學所管理，辦得不壞。民國成立，歸教育局主管，雖在軍閥時代，未敢動用。民川　施新縣制，春滅了敎育局，財政上又統收統支，地方教育經費自百分之三四十，跌洛到百分之五。今年情形更加惡化，縣預算祇列中心國民學校·至於一般國民學校經費，硬時鄉保自籌。今日汕乾燈草　的鄉鎭，如何負擔得了、學校遂不能不關門大吉。講到中心國民學校的設立，並不依照規定一鄉一所，往往七析八扣，橫　縣長的考績教育方面，只佔百分之五，全縣學校關光，依然動搖不掉他「好言我自為之」，</p>
<p>今年度中央教育經費預算為三千四百億元，佔國家總支出百分之三·六，教育部只得規定四億元貼補國民教育，杯水車薪，何濟於事，何况再有十多個國民教育實騐區，也　嗷待哺等待這筆款子。教育部似乎業經決定各縣國民教育經費不再補助，他們還考慮到學田學產往往為地痞劣紳中飽自肥，中央補助的錢到省沒有問題，省到縣那就問題叢生，其所能獲封的度惠，不知要打幾個大白小扣。</p>
<p>像這樣的局面，遂造成了一面高唱普及教育，一面要上學而不得的現象。據教育部向立法院報吿，三十五年度全國失學兒童達六千萬人，這種損失較六萬萬畝良田的荒蕪更嚴重。這種損失拿什麼東西可以牘得回？同年度全國已識字的人數八七，五七二，四六四，不職字人數二八六，三三二，五三六，文宣佔百分之七六點五八。較卅一，卅二，卅三各年度情形更壞得可怕。這三個年頭識字的百分比都將近百分之五十，這是「全國教育統計　編」的數字，大致不會錯的。</p>
<p>號稱教育發達的地方，如上海，學齡兒童在四十萬以上，二二二市校，僅敢八一，九〇四兒童，九五二私校容納了一八九，八二三兒童，尙有二十萬左右兒童失學。南京現有公私小學一〇八所，可收容五萬兒童，還有五萬兒童鄭　街頭，無校可進。江蘇入學的兒童祇佔了五分之一。粵省人口三千萬學齡兒童四百萬以上，今有國民學校五千所，僅有二百餘萬兒業享受入學之福，其他二百萬兒童摒棄於校門之外。黃河泛濫的災難限七省，長江的災難止於九省，獨學校荒逆流所起的失學災尤其是剛進學的一年級生，然而今日非考不可，考了一校又一校，體重減少了好幾磅，眼眶陷入兩三分，脆的兒童如何經得起這種考的擔？</p>
<p>如能考得取到也罷了，結果考不敢，於是家長勿尾隨福校長先生們，苦苦哀求，求得淚也淌下來，多少小學生為了入學哭腫了眼，多少父母為了子十女入學擬碎了心。他們復　續不斷的走門路，說人情，學校吃不消要人的名片和入行書，不敢公開招生卒造成了所謂「教育黑市」，「教育上的人情主義。」乙是有校可進的兒童，也不是一件不倒羣的事。為因目前敎育退了步。教育退步的主因，是師資退了步，十九省國民敎育師資不合格的佔百分之四六，全國小學教師共六十二萬，師範畢業的不過八萬二千，小學畢業教小學的倒有八萬五千，教師待遇不及聽差，誰肯來硜硜自守折磨·苦難·憔悴·死亡於教育界。處於這種悄形之下，今日的兒童豈不將變為「明日的洗氓」？言念及此，不勝札裏。大家都在忙着然肩間題，教育的百年大計誰也願不了，正國為此，我勿讠來一個敎育原子彈！轟炸出經費來救下一代，違法行救救這個老大國家。我勿的意見是：</p>
<p>一，央對已這下的政策，必須要澈頭澈尾貫澈到底，切忌有政現而無方法，有方法而不執行。更忌這個命令推翻了那命令，這個決議扒熜了那個決議，這個人的辦法變換了好個人的辦法，裝飾門面的經費侵奪了急切需要的經費。</p>
<p>二，日實做到教育執費中央佔百分之十五省百分之廿五，地方百分之卅五。補助國民教育經費中央佔四分之一，省四分之一，地方甽分之二</p>
<p>三，財政為庶政之母，財政為民所得的再分配。在統收統支的制度下，我們固不能獨倡「教育經費獨立」，但分配給教育的錢應該注意到成例與規定，至少取諸於學田學產的教育經費，仍應用諸於敎育。若果辦不到，只有運動教育經費獨立</p>
<p>四，財政經濟必須表裏配合，以財政培養經濟，以經濟增佃財政。民窮當必財盡，裕國必先當民。政府不能僅岡稅收的增加而忽視稅源的培養，培養稅源，教育經費才有着落。</p>
<p>五，健全稅收制度。務使事權集中。「整稅重於增稅」，朱開征者從速辦理，已開征而中飽者從速澄淸，這不特可增稅」，未開征者從還辦理，已開征而中飽者從速清，這不特可增稅，且可增人民的義務心。一定要如此辦，敎育經費才不致一籌莫展。</p>
<p>六，學田學產多為土誼劣紳所把持侵佔，影響敎育建設，亟宜由上級機關與民意機構的助力，切實清理。有為的敎育界人士，應參加民意機構，打倒土誼劣紳，善勢力必須國結一到處成勢成潮與噁心勢力過明白。</p>
<p>七，現有師範生四四·〇〇〇餘，簡易師範生一一〇·〇〇〇，兩種不到十六萬，以一個敎師敎廿五個兒童計，今後急應培養二百萬敎師，餘全國民敎育。同時縣長考核，敎育成績應佔百分之卅，對敎曾使有所　力，有所顧忌。敎局要恢復，而且要加強組織。</p>
<p>斐希脫說：敎育人人要受，教育人人要管，現在正是人民要受教育的時候，人民要管教育的時候了。記得美國喬治亞州教育廳長古林司因教員待遇非薄，十八個月中巳有六六九九　轉業退職，去年一月份，他向立法院要求增加教師東脩百分之五十，當時各報均稱古氏此舉實為「教育的原子彈」。並指出此事難辦，因敎育費已佔全州怍入之半數，旋平氏各家長農·工·商　各界和蔡會痛把利害，並由敎師各捐二元編印小冊子宣傳，奪鬥到今年一月，居然達到目的。司見中在人為，。們盼望這個原子彈亦能發揮威力，從山窮水盡炸出柳暗花明。</p>

<h3>蘇聨在韓佔領區　徵壯丁五十萬人　霍奇在返國述職期間報告韓局眞想　李承晚主張韓南實行武裝</h3>
<p>〔本眾社盛頓廿四日電〕朝鮮美軍司〇長官霍奇頃在此談稱：蘇軍當局在朝鮮個別〇區，現正以中共軍隊為核心，　募十七歲至廿五歲之朝鮮壯丁，企圖組成龐大之朝鮮軍隊，估計蘇軍佔領區內該項適齡壯丁約有五十萬人，日軍前所繳出之武器，殆即將用以配備該項軍隊，但朝鮮實無徵募任何軍隊之理由。關於美方與蘇軍當局乙地所進行之談判，前途似極少希望，蘇方在共佔領區鐵佈，殊使吾人難以獲悉其內情云。此係霍奇今日與杜魯門總統詳論進鮮之局勢後，向訪員所發表之談話。據陸軍部長柏德遜談稱：霍奇此次奉召回國述職，乃係協助陸軍部與國務院草擬朝鮮情形之報吿書，俾使馬歇爾國務卿至莫斯科舉行四國外長會議，討論朝鮮時有所根據。又據國務院官員稱：霍奇回國報吿當地情形後，幷未使美國對朝鮮之政策，有絲毫之改變，美國現復進行之方針有二：（一）鞏固緯南之經濟發展；（二）樹立協議立法，此為推進朝鮮政治之最佳辦法。另悉；　奇與馬歇爾進行會談，歷時甚暫，幷未論及將在莫斯土討論之朝鮮問題，霍奇大部份時間皆在陸軍部，與有關官員商討管理朝鮮之問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕最近自朝鮮返此之朝鮮委員會主席李承晚，本日要求美國武裝韓南人民，幷准其進行軍事訓練。李氏幷稱：當蘇聯在韓北訓練龐大朝鮮軍隊之際，豈可剝奪韓南人民實行武裝及進行軍事訓練之權！李氏續稱：「如不容緯人組織其自己之政府，則吾人將見信奉民主之朝鮮遭共產黨之蹂躪」云云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕朝鮮南部與主聯盟領袖李承晚及朝鮮美軍司令霍奇中將均在華盛頓指責蘇聯紅軍招募朝鮮人，蘇聯勞工機關報屈魯特報今日社評，雖非直接答覆兩氏之言，但指李承晚擬從美國獲取武器，俾對朝鮮北部共產黨開始「軍事行動」。</p>
<p>韓南單獨政府三月一日成立</p>

<p>〔聯合社樸資鎭廿五日電〕朝鮮出席聯合國大會觀察員葉露　今日宣稱，已請美國務卿馬歇爾在莫斯科四外長會議中力謀和平解決朝鮮問題。據朝鮮南部軍司令舊奇報吿，蘇聯己承認在朝鮮蘇軍佔領區內微募鮮人，霍氏之言完全眞確。如美蘇兩國不能在莫斯科談判解決，則聯鮮問題應提交聯合國機構。朝鮮現狀如不改善，有發生內戰可能。葉露養會向馬歇爾保證，朝鮮所欲者祗有和平，同時並向蘇聯作此保證。朝鮮對蘇聯並無軍事企圖·但不願為美國或蘇聯及任何國家之傀儡，朝鮮南部現由美軍佔領，葉露意曾謂馬歇爾為軍政府訂定之切實方案，據稱，統一朝鮮之談判，若果如霍奇所云，已成絕望，則三千萬韓人將因飢餓而死，惟談判實際並未絕望云。</p>

<h3>共產主義在南美</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>……共產主義已經站在美洲的後門，假如山姆叔不急起直追，好將失云國防的屏藩……</p>
<p>在今日，共產黨不但是南美洲一補滋長最速的勢力，而且是普遍存在於南美各國的一種政治勢力。這對於美國人是非常重要的，因為它像發生在美國國內一樣，對美國人民具有切身的關係。</p>
<p>美國一向把南美洲看做它的禁響，那裏沒有西半球以外的任何國家和它爭霸。</p>
<p>過云情勢</p>
<p>過去足以危害美國在拉丁美洲的利益的一切威脅，大都來自該大陸邊疆以外；例如在南美西海岸附近海面活動的日本漁船隊，德國潛水艇在東海岸建立燃料補給站的可能性，已經在南美洲建立航空網的德國空中勢力侵入的危險等等。</p>
<p>目前養兌</p>
<p>可是在今日，那威脅却來自內部——蘇聯勢力的侵入南美，一方面是由大門進來的，另一方面是暗中潛入的。</p>
<p>所謂由大門而入，便是蘇聯在大戰勝利後在南美各國所建立的外交關係。譬如駐在委內瑞拉和哥倫比亞的蘇聯大使館的組織，比駐在同一國家的美國大使館的組織更為龐大，便是一個例證。</p>
<p>所謂暗中潛入是指南美各國的共產黨而言，這些共產黨在多數國家取得合法地位，雖還只有幾個月，可是已經像野火般蔓延開來了。</p>
<p>政治經濟</p>
<p>共產黨在南美洲問時擁有政治的和經濟的兩種勢力。在政治方面，共產黨已經運用充分的力量選出智利的現政府，同時在其他數國奠定了反對黨和未來繼承人的地位。在經濟方面，某產黨已經在南美的主要工會中佔有優勢。例如巴拿馬運河是美國兩洋防禦系統的中樞，美國海軍在戰略上需要時可由此自大西洋移入太平洋。但是共產黨現已控制運河地帶最重要的工會，擁有工人一萬八千人。　萬一美蘇間發生戰事，除非美國派遺軍隊保護運河並佔領附近區域，美國所能利用該運河的地方究有多少，實在是一個疑問。</p>
<p>智利的共產黨己經控制了該國最大的工會。智利是出產硝石的國家，而硝石是美國戰爭化學工業所不可少的。智利的共產黨領袖最近曾發表聲明稱：「萬一美國對蘇開戰，智利將停止裝運任何東西前往美國。」</p>
<p>巴西共黨</p>
<p>在巴西共產黨領導下的工會最近會顯示他們的力量，用總罷工的手段，把世界最大咖啡出口市塲的聖多斯海口實行封銷起來。後來又有三個工會發動電車，電話，煤氣和電力的罷工，幾乎使整個巴西京城陷人癱瘓狀態。</p>
<p>美國人往往以為共產黨是烏合之眾，可是去年已西政府准許共產黨參加競選時，却一鳴驚人，獲得六十萬票之多，即全國十個投票人中有一名投共黨票。在巴西京城里的熱內慮，共黨的票數達十一萬六千票，比較競選獲勝的杜特拉將軍所得的十四萬七千票相差無幾。</p>
<p>共產黨不僅在投票方面得勢。當共產黨和巴西政府　對於國內政身法啊生衝突時，他們可以控制全國最强大的工會而發動全國性的大罷工。政府雖能用槍砲鎭壓罷工，其結果徒然加深了上層階級和下層階級問的裂痕。</p>
<p>智利共黨</p>
<p>共產黨在智利大選中以優越的票數獲得了勝利。維台拉總統立刻採納共黨的一部分計劃，容納共產黨員三人入閣，分任交通工務部長，農業部長及拓殖部長等要職。</p>
<p>南美民眾</p>
<p>擁護南美共產黨的民衆，對於西方民主主義毫無好感，他們視美國人為帝國主義者，而不以友人看待。這原因是很簡單的。譬如以委內瑞拉為例，普通工人每天的工資祇有三角，可是買一只鵝蛋要付一角二分，買一磅玉蜀黍要付一角，買一只麵包要付三角，賈一夸脫牛奶要付三角五分，此輩工人大都在美國人所有的田地上工作，因而怨恨到美國人身上去。</p>
<p>第二種原因是南美民衆知識程度低落，美國人的思想不容易灌輪到他們的頭腦中去。在玻里維亞等國家，人民百分之八十都是文盲，因此無法用文字去感化他們。但文肓對於共產黨亳無妨碍。他們的發曾人都是土著的領袖，直接和民衆說話。同時文盲對於投票亦無阻碍，委內瑞拉的投票人曾用顏色卡紙投票，白的代表民主行動黨，紅的代表共產黨。</p>
<p>對於知識份子，共產黨在南美建立了一個新聞綱，每天由莫斯科方面發送新聞和宣傳的電訊，約有一萬餘字。</p>
<p>共產黨在南美確已變得壓倒的優勢。某美國作家喟然嘆道：「我們和拉丁美洲共度的蜜月已經過去了！」</p>
<p>美國對策</p>
<p>美國現在要怎樣纔能防止南美的完全脫輻呢？最切要的步驟是設法把南美上層階級和下層階級問的裂縫彌合起來：採取經濟的行動以創造一個穩定的中產階級。辦法是提高平民的購買力，使一部份民衆從勞工羣中一躍而為小商人，小店主，小廠主和自立的農民。</p>
<p>工業化不能解決整個南美問題。如果工業只是大規模的企業，雇用大批工人而給以菲薄的工資，那麼共產主義會吸收許多新的信徒。但是如果能帮助拉丁美洲建立它固有的小商業，那麼可以替民主主義樹立一個經濟期礎。這就是說：帮助南美工業化，不應當僅僅着眼於大企業，對於小工業也應當給以貨款。此外，應當對南美人實施技術訓練，養成管理人才，並灌輸他們以工商業技能。同時，中產階級是依靠小康的薪水階級而生存的。所以問時要提高一般工人的待遇。惟有這樣纔能恢復南美人對美國的信心。</p>
<p>改善生活</p>
<p>因此欲保持美國在南美的利害關係，非以武力而以友誼，方能逹到目的。但是所謂友誼，僅僅靠宣傳品是不够的，必須用改善人民生活的事實來義現，纔能奏效。</p>
<p>「紐約時報」曾經刊載惠特從巴西京城寄發的通訊，內稱：「根據最近的事實，蘇聯正向全世界展開一種爭霸的攻勢，其猛烈程度不减於昔日的第三國際最活躍時代」。</p>
<p>共產主義已到了美洲的後門，美國已瀕於失掉南美屏藩的危險了。</p>

<h3>青海省府滬辦事處主任　挪用公款講買黃金　經四監委查明報由主席批令嚴辦　國防部派員協查軍人移餉講金事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨報所記現任官吏利用公款在金潮期問購買黃金之人物，昨據記者向可靠方面探悉，係青海省政府駐滬辦事處主任，此人現巳離滬，可能已返靑海。至其挪用公款總數，共為國幣十億元，其中三億五千萬元，業經查明確係購買黃金，其餘六億五千萬元之用途未明。如以三億五千萬元計，則其購進之黃金尙不足百條，在緊個金融風潮中仍屬「蒼蠅」之流，但因其身為公務員利用公款以圖非法利益，有干法紀，此次經監察委員查明呈報蔣主席，奉批「依法嚴辦」。現悉四監察委員業於昨日公畢返京，該案巳草擬文稿，日內即將提出彈劾，一俟彈劾成立，將移付司法機關嚴懲。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市執行物價管制之機構，有警備司令部，警察局及社會局三機關。以往因聨緊尚欠緊密，故有一方對違反限價商人已加拘捕而一方尙欲傳訊者。現為求統一執行管制起見，特於昨日下午假社會局會議室開會，商討辦法，出席社會局吳開先·顧炳元·吉明齋·周味辛，警備司令部張亞民，警察局徐幼祚等。吳局長意今後因取得聯繫，如有傳問時互相通知，如何處罰則由三機關商議決定，以使意見步驟一致，則執行管理時亦可方便。警備司令部及警察局代表允將該項意見轉呈上峯請示後再作決定。</p>
<h3>公義米號囤積案　三職員解地檢處</h3>

<h3>國際飯店勞資糾紛　侍應生減少薪水　經商談暫緩實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國際飯店於昨日發生勞資糾紛。緣該店職工之待遇本分二種，凡與客人接觸之侍應生待遇，因可自客人處取得小賬，故祗為其他職工待遇之半。嗣後經理部認為此法不妥，自去年十二月起，將全體職工之待遇規定一律，另在房間賬上加小賬一成，以所得予全體職工平分，侍應生不得再向住客索取小賬，如有查出，將予革職處分。該項辦法本擬試行三月，至本月底滿期。在此期間因查得侍應生仍有向住客索取小賬情形，故該店經理林勉之乃擬自三月一日起恢復三月前辦法，欲將房間部侍應生之薪水减少百分之四十，十四層樓侍應生之薪水减少百分之五十，以减少所得，補貼工程部廚房間之其他職員。房間部及十四層樓之一百二十餘侍應生聞訊，認為小賬旣不可取，薪水又少一半，遂起糾紛，並於昨日張貼標語。經董事會推派錢新之·施博羣·孫立己三代表，召集職工代表談話後，允將該項辦法暫緩實施。</p>
<h3>配給制開始前補助問題　市當局商有善策　物價差額折現後日可望實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自中央頒佈經濟緊急措施方案後，一般成認金潮雖已平息，然對物價波動，設無妥善有效辦法予以抑平，則生活指數之凍結，勢將引起薪水階級之不安。記者昨曾走訪吳市長，吳氏表示，此次本市物價之暴漲，實受金潮之牽動。本人接任一年餘，物價之上漲，並未超過一倍以上，而金價猛跳後，物價即隨之直綫上漲。現中央旣經限制黃金買賣，深信物價亦可吿穏定。對於食米一項，更其把握，政府貯有足量食米，對米價必能控制。市長並稱頃有米商代表數人往謁，請求市府配米，市府雖存米豐書，昨日且到有一萬七千祖，而未允彼等所請者，因本市食米所需量，每日為一萬石，現市上存米充沛，若再予配給，則可能造成團積操縱之現象。</p>
<p>對於生活指數凍結後，實物尙未開始配給之前，職工生活如何補助問題，吳市長稱已與社會局吳局長商得善策，即為將本月份該項預定配給品之市價，與上月份市價之差額，折合現金發給職工。吳市長並認為此項方策極為公允，待中央核准後，即可施行。寧院長為此曾於昨日與吳市長通長途電話，昨據吳氏吿記者：此項辦怯可望於本月廿八日起實施。</p>
<p>記者詢以中央擬訂之實物配給辦法限於公敎人員，其他文化界及龐大之工人階級，未能普及，又新聞界同人亦同樣不得受其惠，則生活指數之凍結，對彼等將成最大威脅。吳市畏答以將建議資方實施前述差額折補辦法。並稱：即將與各報館負責人商談，報界同人可母席驚慌。</p>

<h3>一個精神頹唐　一個能言善辯　靜安寺兩和尚　德司密迦再審　請求交保諭俟合議庭裁定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺主持德悟，監院密迦，被控漢奸嫌疑案，昨日在高院再度審訊。德悟光頭上己長滿黑髮，穿黑色僧衣，精神頗頹唐。密迦帶眼鏡，穿灰色僧衣，侃侃而談，能言善辯·和尙趕來旁聽者甚衆，光頭績袍，另有一番氣象。</p>
<p>德悟供稱：我亽三十年任靜安寺住持，邀密迦充任監院。偽上海市佛敎會係上海各寺院組成之宗敎團體，密迦被推為該會之常務理事。同朋日語學校是日本東本願寺辦的，强迫佔用靜安寺小學校舍兩間，我沒有做過該校的董事長，校長是芝峯和尙，現不知去向。偽報所載我是該校董事長及出席開學典禮，均不確。金剛普利法會是西藏喇　榮增堪布發起的，借靜安寺地址舉行。</p>
<p>密迦供稱：佛敎會是同業公會性質，我被推為常務理事，不得不參加，與日本人亳無關係。日本和尙友松來華，是佛敎會推派我去歡迎的，沒有開過座談會。大東亞慰靈會是日本人發起的，因為褚民誼是佛敎徒，所以被列為發起人之一·同朋日語學校我沒有担任過校長，當時偽報所記載的消息都不確實。</p>
<p>末由辯護律師，提出對被吿有利證據多件，並請交保。庭諭具狀聲請候合議庭裁定。本案改期再訊，兩和尙仍還押忠監。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕梁仁達之義弟楊瑞俊，應吳市長之召，於昨日上午十一時赴市府晋謁。市長所以再三叮囑者，純為警吿其切勿將出殯擴大，致歹徒乘機而動。而家屬方面則堅持要舉行大出殯，楊氏昨聲稱「人死了總要出喪。若市府怕妨礙治安，可沿路派警察保護。」市長則稱：一人數少當可加以保護，萬一你們預定參加親屬僅數百人，而結果來了數千人，則從何保護起？我現在已經知道有許多學校把標語傳單都已印好，故站在政府的立塲上，不得不出而警吿你！」末由吳市長建議：梁仁達出殯日期可從速決定，屆時除家屬以外，凡各團體參予送喪者，一律限制其人數，並絕對禁用任何標語與傳單。楊瑞俊怡言後，當表示與梁氏治喪委員會洽商後再作決定。</p>

<h3>列無葬身之地　土葬火葬　均有問題</h3>
<p>〔本報讀〕據悉：本市人口之死亡率，根據去年衛生局之統計，平均每月在一千人中死亡三人。如本市以四百萬人口計算，則每月平均有一萬二千人亡故。目前本市積柩在十萬具以上，而一般公墓多已額滿，祇虹橋公墓等尙有少許空穴。為解決該項問題，衛生局除積極清除積柩外，並呈請市府要求撥給公地五百畝作為葬地之用。據估計每畝的可葬一百人，則五百畝可作埋葬五萬人之用。但如依上述死亡率計算，則該五百畝公地，於短期內又將不敷應用。一般人雖擬以火葬方式解決之，但就目前本市靜安寺公墓所有之設備而言，每日祇能火葬三具，則即使淸除十萬餘具之積柩，亦需長時方能完畢。</p>
<h3>復興島疑案　眞想已大白　李雲鵬等盜　賣物資　貪污嫌疑被提公訴　浴缸藏金一節查明訛傳　王千里等誣告罪嫌符合赦例　不起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復興島疑案，經地檢處四閱月之偵查，案情業己大白，緣該島勝利前，為日人佔作海軍駐在根據地，敵投降時遣留物資甚夥，首批入該島之接收辦事人員，確有相互勾串盜賣物資之罪嫌，惟浴缸藏金被隱匿一節，則係以訛傳訛，更因人事上之摩擦，挾嫌誣吿，致使該案越形神秘複雜。被告行總農委會技術組專員王千里，漁管處工友總領班鄭子平，工人領班鄭國棟，王金棟，工友鄭維新，雇員陳家活等七人，雖有誣吿罪嫌，然犯罪時間在民國卅五年十二月卅一日以前，符合大赦令甲項赦免規定，故予以不起訴處分。據承辦檢察官顧宏標在其不起訴書中稱：復興島勝利後有海軍駐紮，王千里為行總派往該島創立辦事處之初期負責人。王遂自詡</p>
<p>交涉辛勞　擬攫得設置機構之籌備會主任委員。嗣以農委會反隸屬於漁管處，王乃心懷怨望憤懣不己，復因漁管處之事務課長李雲鵬為其所介紹，課員王頌謙，金振聲，一為其同族弟兄，一為其隨同進駐，以為腹心滿佈，可藉工人等擴張自已勢力，潛謀傾軋，已非一日。後該島空地上防空壕內發現埋有白磁浴缸兩只，一時謠稱其內</p>
<p>滿藏金條　其發現工人王奎，原為李雲鵬之私黨，李因欲盜竊物資，潛與海軍排長牛春齡勾結，幷串同王頌謙，金振聲，王奎為一氣，盜運物資出外，風聲所播，不免為人所知。王千里以李為己所引進，當樂為己用，諷示李辭去事務課長職務，以為拆台計劃。詎李因利之所在，惟恐職位動搖，乃倒戈拒絕，於是雙方挾仇甚深，遂由王嗾使鄭子平等，分別亂發</p>
<p>匿名密告　對李雲鵬等盡力攻擊，經鑑定化名「白志才」之密吿函係被吿鄭維新之手筆，化名「楊弼亭」，「楊弼湯」之吿密信，雖不能由筆跡斷定何人所為，經搜出綫索顯有人受王千里所暗示而發。因王千里之介紹人行總技正兼農委會第一組主任李象元，有內姪名楊熙堯，又名舜堯，曾至島謀事米成，該楊熙堯與王千里自屬沆瀣一氣，就「堯舜禹湯」之字義，與夫「亨弼熙謀」之用語，分明採集自</p>
<p>尚書堯典　是該項匿名信為楊熙堯之假訛亦復無疑。惟其餘串通盜賣物資部份之李雲鵬，王頌謙，金振聲，王奎四人，首先駐人復興島，其時敵遺留島上物資，尙未淸理就緒，李等乘機勾結在島上擔任礬衛之海軍陸戰隊第三營第一連第三排排長牛春齡，陸續將物資偸運交牛携至太古碼頭及蘇州河泥城橋等處變賣，去年六月二十四日，李等又將島上接收來之舊鉛皮二百九十五張，馬達一只，五金洋鎖門叶二十箱及塌車架鐵管等件，出售於馬驥良，韓順榮等，由牛負責運輸，</p>
<p>事機不密　被警備司令部扣獲，經偵訊後，僅將牛春齡送海軍軍法處懲辦。牛被押後，李雲鵬恐其吐露眞情，曾假作探訪與牛見面一次，並贈送牛之眷屬金條三十兩。故被吿李雲鵬，王頸謙，金振聲核有刑法第二十八條，懲治貪汚條例第三條第二款之罪嫌，主奎核有刑法第二十八條，懲治貧汚條例第一絛第一項下段，第三條第二款之罪嫌，故依特種刑事訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百卅條第一項，提起公訴。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕小學敎師聯合進修曾，於昨日下午，假香雪園招待記者，對爭取私校敎師配給實物權利，及光漢小學解聘敎員糾紛事，有所呼籲。主席葛志成稱：政府對公敎人員配給日用必需品，而置私校敎職員於不顧，認為頗不合理。去年政府曾高喊敎育不分公私之口號。公校與私校敎職員所負之敎育責任原屬相等，則此次實物配給不應有別。或有人謂私校敎職員待遇較公校為佳，但一般比較無甚差別。不能因少數特殊例子而概括一切。旦私校敎職員之應有配給實物權利，有前例可援。蓋現今市府公敎人員物品配給處，私立學校亦可申請配售。即以敵偽時期本市情形而言，偽府對私校敎職負亦有配給品。政府應格外注意此點。現小敎聯擬聯合本市私立中學敎職員，文化界人土，及南京之私校敎職員，以共同爭取配給實物權利云。</p>

<h3>委託銷售之輸出品　限定時間結售外匯　指定銀行應負責準時結售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行業務局及外匯審核處，昨日會銜分發通函三份予各指定銀行，對委託銷售之輸出品，有所規定，茲摘譯如次：</p>
<p>第八十五號通函略云：即日起，一九四六年三月十四日所發之第十二號通函，即予註銷，另以下述規定代之：修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第七章關於指定銀行收購自華出口或轉山口匯票及背審證明等等辦法，茲特規定：設是項輸出品，係屬委託銷售者，（即並不隨信用證書裝船之貨），則應按下列步驟處理之：（一）在修正之CBC8a格式表中，應註明「委託銷售」字採。（二）其外匯必須於下開時間內結售：（甲）輸往香港，澳門，及菲律賓等地，限在卅日內。（乙）輸往印度，馬來亞，荷屬東印度，退羅，越南，及東南亞洲等地，限在六十天內。（丙）輸往（甲）（乙）兩項所述地點以外各地，限在九十天內。</p>
<p>（三）修正之。CBC8a格式，發給予出口商時，出口商應予指定銀行以保證，將關係之出口匯票，在上述之限期內，結售予指定銀行。設此項保證並未履行，則該出口商須另再保證於最短期間內，在其本人之戶名下，以最高價格出售該項輸出品。（四）本通函中所指之委託銷售輸出品，其所得之外匯，指定銀行應負責準時結售予中央銀行。（五）指定銀行對委託銷售輸出品各項文件之處理，亟宜謹愼。同時須注意所呈發票開列之各貨，業經精確估値在案，並望注意將該項外匯，結售予央行。</p>
<p>第八十六號通函略云：以下對於現有委託銷售輸出品之外匯交割辦法，係根據第十二號通函中繼續生效之各條款而定：（一）除中央銀行另行規定外，所有一九四六年十一月七日以前輸出貨物之外匯，概須按照一九四七年二月六日以前所行之官價外匯率，結售予央行。類此案件，務須於一九四七年三月十五日以前，向央行美務局申請特許。（二）輸出品於一九四六年十一月七日至十六日之間裝出者，而其外匯亦已於一九四七年十一月六日至十五日之同予以結售者，得享受山口津貼之權利。（三）輸出品於十一月十七日至二月六日之間裝出者，其所結售之外匯，得按其結售日所行之外匯率計算，惟該項外匯必須在第八十五號通函中所規定之期限內結售。否則，將按結售外匯最後一日所行之匯率計算。　第八十七號通函分囑各指定銀行：（一）自二月廿四日起，每週應另備收購出口外匯（格式CBC22b＆24）報吿一份,附同與各出口匯票有關之發票，一併送陳央行業務局。（二）又委託銷售輸出品，亦須附同有關發票，及各出口商所陳繳之保證書，一併送陳央行業務局。</p>
<h3>外股統債平靜</h3>
<p>外股昨無甚變化，大股尙見不振，小型股則尙穩定，結果較前收計英聯怡紗跌半成左右，航業鋼業稍升，餘微挫。</p>
<p>公債昨成交仍屬有限，市况平穩，統丙晨開六六〇〇元，三六〇室雖賣到六三〇〇元，五〇三室五五二室趁低有補，回升至七三〇〇元而後轉盤，結果較前收計甲乙各升三百元，丙戊回好五百元，統丁升四百元，成交的四百萬元。</p>
<h3>小四行　將改為商辦</h3>
<p>本市小四行（即中國通商·四明·中國實業·國貨等四銀行）原係官商合辦，當局現決定出售官股，仍改為商辦，聞原則業已決定，惟技術方面尙待撿討，因原來票面價値頗低，與現在實際價値相差甚巨，故究竟如何計算，尙在仔細檢討中。</p>
<h3>白糖開升萬元</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢緊秀，現貨軋缺之白糖，更覺堅挺，升萬餘元不一。公會劃盤，秘魯細砂棧單為二十三萬元，其他亦有喊升。號貨如興化白開升二十一萬元至廿萬〇五六千元。興化赤十五萬元至十四萬七千元。順德靑十四萬元至十三萬七八千元。提莊靑十四萬三千元，棉赤十五萬五千元至一千元。建帮開白糖數十包，價二十下萬元至二十上萬五千元。刁靑十三萬八千元至五千元，共成交五六百件。</p>
<h3>賣氣籠罩市場　紗價步步下降</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形不振，自開盤後，始終為賈氣所籠罩，買戶寥寥，各支售價步步降落，市塲當局雖曾將廿四日紡建掛牌所售各支價格一一詳列黑板，諄諄吿誡業中人只可加百份之五，以為合法利潤，然實際成交之價，恒多低於紡建開出之價，尙乏受主，可見交易淸淡之一般矣。收市時，各價較前又小五萬至十萬，人心依然疲頓之至。</p>
<h3>棉布價見下游</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開平定市，塲客銷呆滯。開聞棉布公會將決定辦理存貨登記，致人心趨疲，業中人爭光拋售，浮戶相繼脫手。十二磅龍頭細布初開十四萬元，旋退至十三萬六千元，最後為十三萬九千五百元。五福曾一度降至十三萬二千元，最後十三萬七千元。其他色布及土林布價，亦均見下游。又紡建公司照例開售各種布疋，細布五福掛牌十三萬七千元，四君子及金印直貢十三萬六千元。</p>
<h3>棉花交易不暢</h3>
<p>昨日棉花化市况交易依然不暢，僅申新六廠進漢口細絨花一百包，每擔價為五十六萬元。又申新二廠進靈實花一百包，價為八十三萬元。</p>
<h3>米糧價格平定　油市回挫雜糧步挺</h3>
<p>昨米市到源共計一萬五千二百餘石，南市早平午緊，北市早堅午淡，結果粳米均少榮辱，站定之格。白元陰元亦少上落，秈米彷彿。高貨交易價白粳為十一萬元，薄稻十萬元至八，早稻十萬四千，羊秈十萬一至三千，白元十一萬八至十二萬五千元。</p>
<p>油市新議價格調整，配油正在辦理。靑島來電吿疲，店胃看望，各油一致回挫五六千元至萬元不一。豆餅各埠停辦，價跌二千元。</p>
<p>黃豆轉口不動，本街淸閒，回落一二千元。赤豆漲定，蠶豆立定，綠豆帶疲，苞米靑島不動，明定暗堅。紅糧相仿，生仁廣帮南洋去化活玲，續升五六千元。芝蔴南洋去胃香燥，價格步挺，迭見高峯，再漲萬元。棉餅下降二一千元，棉子平定，山芋乾下游乏交。</p>
<h3>發展南洋外銷　市商會徴集樣品</h3>
<p>本市染織業同業公會茲為發展南洋棉布外銷起見，特分函各同業，徵集各種花色樣品，送交市商會彙集，該項樣品業已大部集中，其中以棉絲交織品為多數，現由該會編號粘貼，不日即可送出。市商會此番發動南洋外銷，貨物種類甚多，凡各種國產品國內成本連達該地後，外銷市價能求得平衡者，均可繳納樣品，一併彙寄，目前正分別與各公會接洽中。</p>
<h3>銀兌業公會續請　准予經營小額存放　擬具恢復營業辦法七條</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕錢兌業公會昨為籲請准予經營小額存放業務，特再上呈中央銀行。該公會理事長江雲程，及常務理事李蘭生，劉錫臣等，已定今日晋謁央行貝總裁，代表該業請願茲錄該公會上央行呈文如次：呈為續請准許恢復經營小額存放業務，以維生計事。竊敝同業自經去秋美鈔訂定買賣臨時辦法三項後，營業集於停頓，維持為難，經於卅五年十一月一日，備文附呈改善辦法，請求核准在案。今政府頒佈經濟緊急揹施方案，禁止黃金買賣，外幣流通，敝業全體陷於停頓，生機斷絕。會負莊號，共有二百餘家。從業人員衆多，間接賴以為生者尤夥。一旦失業，羣情惶駭，不可終日。若改他業，旣非所習，窒碍又多。爰經集會討論，會以恢復本業戰前之經營小額存放業務，最為相宜。與政府管制金融，旣無妨碍。對於小本工商及平民，又有輔助之功。失業問題，亦可解決。一舉所得，情任皆宜。惟前呈辦法，與目今之情形欠合。謹另擬辦法七條，續呈鑒核，鈞座權衡經濟，總筦金融，伏祈俯念下情，惠予批准，實為德便，謹呈中央銀行總裁貝。附呈恢復經營小額存放業務辦法：一，調整資本額。二，存款遵奉繳納保證金。三，遵守關於金融管理之一切章則。四，劃一會計制度，以便主管機關查核。五，將牌號全體改稱銀號，以資一律。六，以現有會員為限。七，防止頂牌號，不得更易重要職員。</p>
<h3>銀樓同業及職工代表　昨向吳市長請願　代向主管機關宣達苦衷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀樓業同業公會，由裘天實姚允文，姚桂卿，老天　裘雲民，老鳳祥孫介俊，慶雲費百鴻，職工會理事長張德鋆　為代表，並有南京，寗波，揚州，蘇州等地代表多人，於昨日中午十二時赴市府向吳市長請願，面遞呈文。當由吳市長在會客室中接見。代表等表示所以一再向當局請願者，實係逼於生計，並稱：同業中家庭負擔較重者，日內即將發生恐慌，銀樓業向來安分守己，自財政部頒布經濟緊急措施方案後，無異宣吿死刑。所以希望中央唯飾金得以自由買賣。俾銀樓業能繼續生存」，吳市長於展閱彼等呈文後稱：中央之頒布經濟緊念措施方案乃屬萬不得已。故希望銀樓業能替政府着想，為噸全大局，不得不犧牲自我。對於各位所提之要求，我不是主管機關，無權答覆。目前本人僅建議各位暫時應先遵重中央命令，而一方面再向主管當局提出請求。而代表等則稱曾往謁央行總裁貝祖詒，然因不得要領，故再度蔽請吳市長援助，懇求市長轉遞呈文，並代作呼籲，俾下情上達，拯銀樓業於水深火熱之中。最後吳市長表示對彼等甚為同情，當儘力代為設法云。</p>
<p>昨日上下午本市銀樓業會合各地抵滬之代表整日假新都飯店集商，並議決於今日起，所有請願代表七十餘人，（包括全國各地代表及上海勞方代表等）將分批晋京向行政院，財政部，經濟部，及其地有關之各部會呼籲，要求更改財部已頒之六條處理辦法，以維全國百餘萬銀樓職工之生計云。</p>
<h3>二批絲織原料　放發數量統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲織聯營公司第二批請發原料申請書，業於昨日送陳絲織輸出協導會業務管理處。第二批參加織機共三一八台，需廠絲四十箱，人造絲五十三箱。又第一批原料計廠絲二百祖，人造絲三百箱，業已發交絲織廠二百〇三家，織機共一六三二台云。</p>
<h3>原則上已獲決定　蛋類即可外銷　本年桐油出口可達五萬噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：我國蛋類之外銷事宜，刻已獲致原則上之決定。一俟細則商定，即可開始發動外銷。我國蛋類之輸出地，目前以英國為主，大致將先自冰蛋着手。按我國戰前冰蛋之輸出量，年達四五萬噸，本年大致可裝出九千噸，約合英金一百八十萬鎊。目前因天氣逐漸轉暖，蛋類價格亦可望逐步趨廉。按二月十五日之行市，冰蛋每噸價約合英金二百三四十鎊。目前價格，的合二百十鎊左右。與英國之開價二百鎊，已相接近云。</p>
<p>又據專家估計：按去年度我國桐油外銷之情形言，本年度外銷桐油，可預期達到五萬噸之目標。該項輸出額，上海可佔七成，香港可佔三成。惟目前國外桐油價，每磅僅美金三角八分，折合國幣每市担五十萬元。而我國目前市價，每市担的合四十五萬元至五十萬元，故尙未能發動外銷云。</p>
<h3>內銷香茶價俏</h3>
<p>各式內銷茶，邇來本街店莊及蘇州帮俱思活動，尤以莉茉香片，注視者益緊，聞刻下已有相當數量，正在騐看中。但貨方索價異常高昂，每担均達一百六七十萬，綜觀此種情形，一時恐難以順利做開。至於洋莊茶市，英商出口行對祁門紅茶雖仍靑陳，惟鑒於目前變戶堅持，亦取觀望態度。他若抽珍。珍眉等花色，吐納續有授受，價格穩定如故。</p>
<h3>白煤銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>白煤因天氣轉暖，銷路較為淸淡，市價因來源稀少，貨主猶極力扳持，故交易頗為呆滯。烟煤實銷戶逢低有吸，故行市巳止跌轉堅。柴炭供求平衡，市價極為平穩。煤球因主要原料缺乏，品質一再减低，廠盤繼績掛高，用戶多已改用其他燃料代用，故銷路已較前略遜。</p>
<h3>第一批焦作煤　下月即可抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會負責人徐樂天赴台灣視察煤礦情形，已於昨日公畢搭船離台，今明日可抵本埠。自公敎人員決定配售煤斤後，上海一地每月的需七千噸，南京方面以公務人員較多，每月的八千噸，共計一萬五千噸。現悉燃管會為開源起見，早派大批人員赴焦作煤礦工作，平漢路之運輸問題亦已解決，故第一批焦作煤約可於三月下旬抵滬。目前時局之不靖，對於煤礦之增產工作頗多妨碍，例如燃管會正擬派員赴傳山煤礦，人未至而城已失守，中興煤礦亦兩度開工而遭破壤</p>
<h3>花呢一致上升</h3>
<p>春季需銷之細毛花呢，不論西裝套頭料，華服男婦袍料，昨市仍多上升，零躉價格，一致躍漲。淡灰顏色，走銷允較活躍，本客帮俱有點級，成交雖然零疋居多，但其賣買則頗熱鬧，蓋照目下之外匯定價，定貨萬難，且成本無一不超過市價也。</p>
<h3>麥爾登價下挫</h3>
<p>麥爾登呢昨巿步轉下游，欲軋頭寸者四萬八九千元亦有售出。此貨雖嗣後定到困難，且照一萬二千元美匯揭算，成本須七萬元出零，但因天氣轉暖，實銷已成尾聲，買方需要减少，持貨者為拆息關係，及週轉賣買其他貨品之故，乃不得不削價斬出，否則勢必呆擱數月耳。</p>
<h3>粉廠運用貸款　採購小麥供應配售　過去虧賠將會商貼補辦法</h3>
<p>本市配售麵粉，已自二十二日起，由福新，茂新，阜豐，華豐，裕通等五大麵粉廠以四聯總處貸款二十億元及各廠自籌十五億元所收購之小麥製粉供應，前曾與市政常局商定以每担五一〇〇元之價格，向產地收購小麥五萬祖運滬，以供民需，現因公敎人員供應辦法，將於三月間實施，故對採購數額將加以放長，的須十一萬包，可雜持至月梢，則上項資金應周轉二次，現分三地區收購中，無錫為茂新，上海為福新，泰州為阜豐，沿京滬綫一帶估計尙有存麥十萬担，收購可以無慮，現無錫地區小麥已絡續抵滬，截止且前已收總額的五萬餘担，每担價格自七萬元起，至目前收價八萬二千元不等，每包製就之成本，達五萬八千元，本市限價為廠盤每包三萬元，零售三萬一千五百元，二月份將虧賠六十億元，現各該廠推派代表與吳市長磋商中。據悉市政府與糧食部會商，擬以麵粉存底折價貼補，細則待訂，並於三月下旬中信局向國外訂購之小麥抵滬起卸後，另訂優待辦法，由代磨與承購二辦法中任擇其一·三月間配粉辦法，因公敎人員將處於主要被供應地位，其他切麵業等售與一般消費者之數額將予大量减縮，至油條大餅業及切麵業若干會員，私將配粉轉售黑市，獲取暴利，社會局正抽查各店號之零售賬簿，核實懲處，五麵粉廠自去年八月十九日起至十二月三十一日止，供應麵粉計二三Ling萬包，本年度有六〇萬包，計達二九〇萬包，政府所給予補助，由中信局撥五〇〇〇噸小麥，折合本麥十七萬包，及洋粉十六萬包，由於本市禁止出口及麵粉限價，致各廠咸感收支不敷，難以維持，然沿京滬綫一帶，另有五十餘家中小型麵粉廠，利用轉口華北之便，營業頗為發達云。</p>
<h3>茶商要求央行提高收購價格</h3>
<p>關於茶葉收購事宜，昨日茶商代表孫曉村於下午赴中央銀行呈遞該會會員大會決議提高收購價格，及或由茶商收回自行轍出，過去押款准予寬限三個月後歸還等書面要求，據該行某負責人透露，對茶商請求提高收購價格，因過去早有協定，且已呈報中央，茶商如因目前外匯調整而即要求提高，似屬於理不合，恐未必能予通過。關於自行輸出，如能將過去農行之貸款淸償，當然絕無問題。如須寬限三個月押款期限，亦不可能。並聞央行即將根據以上二點理由，於今日函覆該會。</p>
<h3>人造絲又抬高</h3>
<p>人造絲昨又吿抬高，因配售將停止及配售價將提高之說盛傳塲內，以致開盛後即見漲風，一二〇號高山有光七百十萬元開盤，旋即上升，迄午收盤做七百四十萬元，下午再高，最大做到七十萬元，後做五十五萬賣出，同行互做五十萬元，廠經昨市頗形靜寂，洋行無交易，用戶做開十担D字等級，價七百八十萬元，干經另担計價六百萬元，但乏成交，綢貨交易淸稀，做價與上日相仿，只華錦縐因人造絲價漲做大二三百元。</p>
<h3>人造絲截短纎維　准予輸入</h3>
<p>天元實業股份有限公司，獨家經理美天國維斯克斯公司，出品之人造絲截短纖維（Rayon　staplefiber）前經該公司向輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會，函請准予輸入。現聞已由該會提交重分類及訴願問題小組會，稅則問題顧問委員會，聯合會議第二次會議議決：人造絲截短纖維視同人造絲，歸入稅則第一三〇號進口云</p>
<h3>中信局人造絲　臨時中止配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局本定週一配售人造絲，惟以配價間題未決，而臨時中止。昨日高山人造絲價，已叩七百五十萬元高價。聞中信局之人造絲，尙待請示宋院長核定配價問題後，再行配售云。</p>
<h3>寬放進口限額　新藥業今日請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新藥業公會，為要求寬放西藥進口限額事，特推請顧克民，陳豐鎬，葛　聲，吳志衛，黃素封，倪　夫，陳銘珊等代表，定今日赴輸管會限額分配處請願。又以本年二月至四月之西藥限額暫停，故要求將西藥限額併入化學品限額中計算。</p>
<p>又該業復呈請衛生署，要求：（一）物資供應局所配售之西藥中，搭配國產西藥二成。（二）檢驗成藥，應無分中西。（三）己送請檢騐之成藥，請早日檢定。</p>
<h3>撙節外匯資源　寬限恐難如願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會限額分配處某負責人談稱：（一）該處對第二類各項輸入品限額之規定，事前曾經各方專家及有識之士，從長審愼研討，然後確定。且據確切統計，本年內若千原料品及機器之進口，總額達美金四億七千二百五十九萬元。而全年出口及僑匯所可得之外匯資源，僅的美金二億元。故為撙節外匯計，對各業要求寬放限額一點，恐難如願。（二）白報紙之進口限額，在各項進口品限額中，佔數頗鉅，惟文化界仍感不敷應用，當設法於下季中考慮改進。（三）烟草之限額較大，因財部考慮鉅額之稅收，於整個國家收入有補云</p>
<h3>椰子油價續降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕小呂宋椰子油去年以到貨甚多，市價曾由每担卅二萬下跌至十三萬元。下冬以南洋方面禁止出口，進口商訂貨多遭折本，到貨旣稀，銷路陡增，故一度曾漲至每担八十萬元。茲聞某行商進來椰子油一千餘桶（每桶四百磅），以近日實銷轉稀，昨市做價每担四十萬元，尙無受主。</p>
<h3>紐約猪鬃市軟　腸衣今日議新價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市猪鬃出口商接獲紐約來一電稱：猪鬃市况頗軟，重慶鬃紐約交貨為美金二元七角，漢口十七號猪鬃為三元九角半，上海十七號鬃為二元。本市猪鬃價格，昨日均見新價，重慶鬢新價開出四百萬元，漢口鬃五百六十萬元，上海十七號　為三百萬元，各貨均有成交。川漢業價，已駢紐約行市，僅漢口鬃距離外價尙短百萬之譜。</p>
<p>腸衣自外匯調整後，新價迄未開出，僵持已達一週。昨腸衣業下午集議收購價格，今日可以開出新價。</p>
<h3>多空各具見解　華股仍在盤檔</h3>
<p>華股昨繼續趨盤，銀根前途，多空雙方各具見解，初疲後堅。晨開微穩，一九八號一〇二號來進，新華大通漲停，遞永紗升至二四一〇元·二二四號一四五號三六號二一八號賣到二三六〇元，二二四號尙納，而多掙扎。八五號一四五號七六號一一二號二二四號八三號紛加脫手，而將遞永紗迫低至二三〇〇元。二〇七號九一號雖進，升至二三四〇元，二二號二八號一四五號賣到二二六〇元，一二九號九四號一二號變到二二四〇元，二三二號一九人號二〇六號趁低進至二二九〇元，一四五號一三號仍有供給，降為二二一〇元。九七號二二四號二三二號一五二號二三五號八四號三五號八三號俱進，一四五號出後復進，十時五十分後，盤高至二四一五元。一四號一七三號一三號趁高脫手，降至二三三〇元。八五號八四號一八〇號九四號尙進至二三九〇元，一九八號一五一號一一二號則費到二三一〇元。四五號二三二號一八五號二二六號七〇號均進，檯面極涸，乃將遞永紗拉高至二四四〇元。十一時半轉入盤檔。二一五號五五號二一八號一二五號二一三號一〇五號二一九號賣小至二三二〇元。一七七號一九六號則補，臨收尙穩。結果較前收計永紗升半成弱，美亞景福新光勤興各降少許迄半成不到，華豐平，中法跌一成，遞交永紗升半成，信和華豐新光微升，冷股大通漲停，新亞升成半，餘升降俱微。</p>
<p>午後二〇七號上塲即進，即將遞交抬高至二四〇〇元。二二四號一五二號八五號八三號九一號一四五號連袂售出，回降至二二七〇元。一二號一四五號一五二號一八六號三一號賣到二二五〇元。三五號二二三號二一三號一八〇號二一五號紛購，現交被抬高，逐漸升至二三〇〇元外。一八六號八三號尙賣，三時後復盤低至二二六〇元。一九七號一四五號二八號一五四號二一三號再進，現永紗又見倒掛，臨收見昂，一四五號九五號均納，而升至二三七〇元。一三號逢高仍售而轉盤。結果較前收計永紗新光景福升半成左右，信和華豐勤興微升，美亞跌少許，中法跌成半弱，遞交永紗升半成，華豐信和新光景福微升，美亞跌半成，冷股大通漲停，水泥升景綸內衣跌一成，新亞升一成，餘升降不多，塲外各股俱見扳高。</p>

<p>在豫東戰局緊張到不能想像的時候，久已馳名疆塲的吳紹周將軍，率領着他的整編八十五師開到隴海東段野鷄崗附近，加人了保圍豫東的戰鬥序列，正因為這一枝精銳部隊的到達，更堅定了共軍專打國軍主力的計劃，也正因為共軍要實現這個計劃，才造成了國軍這次空前的大捷，這大捷就是本月十二日夜到十三日下午一時的鄧莊寨之役。這一役，國軍在戰果上說，是空前的，共軍傷亡被俘了一萬五千多人，遺棄了許許多多的死屍和武器，更喪失了所謂「堅强」的戰鬥意志。在全戰局的價値上說，是偉大的，不但使風雨飄搖的中原大局轉危為安，徐州威脅解除，即冀魯豫邊區的共軍也根本動搖了。但這一戰太慘烈了，慘到不能以竺墨形容，烈到難以使人置信，共軍攻進了寨，佔領了吳將軍師部對門的院子，共軍暴風雨似的手榴彈，炸死了吳將軍左右的官兵，血染滿了吳將軍的征衣，然而他仍然以堅定沈着的指揮，獲得了預期的戰果，這消息在戰鬥剛剛結束，就像一陣風，立刻傳到了危城開封，因為沒有火車，且國軍仍在掃淸戰塲，所以記者十五號落日照大旗的時候，始得到達了野鷄崗以南四里的鄭莊寨——這是一個很小很小的村莊。</p>
<p>大軍帳中報戰況　胆顫心驚不忍聞</p>
<p>下了火車，踏過了死屍，跳上了吉普車，在車麟麟馬嘯嘯中駛進了體無完膚的鄭莊寨八五師師部，在滿院炸彈破片，柴草狼藉中為師部高級將領拍了照片以後，我就同吳將軍等走進了一間矮山的大軍帳。矮小粗壯，滿身是胆的倪副師長祖耀，用重機關槍似的口吻開始向我報吿戰况，他如同作戰一般的神氣，背述戰鬥的經過，慘烈處，使我阻顫心驚不忍聽下去：</p>
<p>他們是九號由豫北調到野鷄崗下車，剛剛下車，共軍便把他們當作了主要目標，六七兩縱隊由睢縣杞縣北向鄭莊寨攻，三縱隊由民權西向鄭莊寨攻，一二兩縱隊在劉伯誠指揮下，由北邊的王橋向南攻，距離都不到三十里，吳將軍看到這形勢，為了爭取主動，便在這山雨欲來風滿樓的情况之下，於十號派二十三旅六十七團東向民權以西出擊。打了一天多，消滅了共軍七百多人，俘虜了共軍一百多人，這是這次大戰的前奏曲。</p>
<p>血肉橫飛鬼神哭　士兵擲槍來投誠</p>
<p>民權以西的小勝利，是加速這次大戰爆發的近因，共軍十一號各路均作着積極的進攻，雖然他們遭受着堅强的抵抗，但在衆寡懸殊的情勢之下，他們已逼近鄭莊寨附近了。</p>
<p>十二號夜里，這大戰的醞釀已達到了最高潮，劉伯誠在王橋召集團長以上幹部訓話說：「道一次必定要攻下鄭莊寨，必定要消滅八五師，打垮了八五師，我請大家到開對看戲，大家要爭爭氣。」在夜的帳幕中他們被戰神鼓舞着，瘋在般的出動了，這時國軍佈防情形是這樣的：鄭莊寨住着八五師師部，除直屬部隊的一營外，另外有一個工兵營，一個步兵營，其餘該師二十三旅在鄭莊寨以西三里之林莊，一百一十旅在鄭莊以東四里之朱莊，友軍七十二師則全部住野鷄崗。共軍以一三兩縱隊各一部攻野鷄崗七十二師，另外以二縱隊全部六個加強團，及六七兩個縱隊全部猛攻鄭莊寨，以三縱隊一部攻朱莊之一一〇旅，以第五縱隊攻林莊之二十三旅。</p>
<p>戰鬥是當晚十一時開始的，鄭莊寨守軍發見敵情後，開始發砲，接着南部共軍已逼入了國軍機關槍射程以內，寨牆上及寨牆外自此便構成了火網，步槍，機槍，擲彈筒，手榴彈，迫擊砲，一齊連發，火力發揚到最高峯，人喊馬嘶，鬼哭神號，前仆後繼血肉橫飛，寨外的共軍在熾盛的火力掩護下，匐匍前進，他們躍入寨壕，但被寨牆上的手榴彈把他們炸死水里了，他們爬上寨牆，但也被刺滾下寨壕里了。戰爭是越打越慘烈，火光中看見無數攻繫者被打倒在地上，也看見寨牆一堵一堵的倒下來，可是沒有人動搖。三點鐘時候，北寨門一度被被共軍突破，但一軍守軍硬把他們消滅了以後，又堵住了。三點半鐘，砲火稍微稀了一下，但一陣衝鋒號之後，火光中看到寨外潮湧似的共軍，拼命向寨西南角跑，一剎那間，火力集中到西南寨角了，像狂風雨暴，勢不可當，四點鐘時，共軍第二縱隊第六旅十六軍，由宋東旭團長率領着，在强烈的火力掩護下，經五六决失敗之後，終於利用着梯子攻進了鄭莊寨。更慘烈的戰鬥，在寨內展開，牆角里，房頂上，都成了戰塲。一條路，一間屋，都在用血肉爭奪着，一分鐘，一秒鐘，都在表演着悲壯慘烈的活劇，只有機槍與手榴彈在咆哮狂炸，其餘的武器已失了作用。雙方在房坡上跳來跳去，在牆洞中轉去轉來，彼攻此守，此守彼攻，爾退我進，爾進我退，像拉鋸，像推磨，這樣一直苦戰了一點多鐘，共軍終於進展了五十公尺，佔據了師部對門的院子，這是八十五師的參謀處，距師部不到十公尺。師部的院子成了共軍手榴彈與機關槍的總目標，吳師長的參謀與衛士相繼被炸死了，然而共軍却不能再進一步，守軍開始用火攻，寨外的二十三旅與一一〇旅也在吳師長報話機指揮下，縮小反包圍圈，向寨內集中，於是沒有進寨的共軍，在重大壓迫之下，遺屍遍野，丟盔拋甲的漸漸　散了，野鷄崗的共軍也在七十二師的堅强打擊下瀢退了，寨內的共軍，眼看堅不可克，又知歸路斷絕，於是也動搖了，士兵們想繳械，官長們也想投降，於是在那最緊急的情况下，這一團營長以上的官長，開了個會議，宋團長把當時情况分析了之後，因為政委在旁，他沒有表示退降意見，但他把這意見用目光送給各營長，第一營營長首先主張繳械，可是政委就先開槍打死了他，宋團長看見這情形，被迫又率都進攻，但宋團長第一個先陣亡了，其餘也相繼倒在地下，惟有那個政委，仍然在督戰，但到早上八點時候，這政委也被他自已的部下打死了。其餘三百多官兵，仍然據屋抵抗，其中有少數已經沒有官長監視壓迫的士兵，他們把槍擲出來，投誠了。這時國軍的火攻，使殘餘的共軍進退不得，有翅難飛，好多是被燒死了的。</p>
<p>九點半鐘時候，一一〇旅首先開進寨了一個營，寨內的共軍，到十一點多鐘，算是消滅究了。四外零星戰鬥，下午一時才吿了結束。</p>
<p>戰果輝煌自豪　究是誰人害同胞</p>
<p>道一次慘烈的戰鬥，國軍收到了輝煌的戰果，檢到共軍的死屍兩千一百具，負傷後被俘的共軍官兵是四千五百六十七人，俘虜共軍官兵九百人，全戰堪共軍死亡在一萬五千人左右，獲步槍三九七校，輕機槍三十挺，重機槍一〇挺，大小砲十五門。單就在戰爭上說，這個戰果是極輝煌的、可是當倪副師長報告完了之後，吳紹周將軍却沈痛而廠恭的說：「這次戰役之慘烈，是歷來所未見，本師在友軍七二師配合之下，雖然獲得了這個戰果，可是我們並不願誇耀目豪，相反的，我們却感到非常痛心，因為打死的都是自己的同胞，進究竟是誰害了他們？我們眞不噸打他們呵！」</p>
<p>可憐鄭莊寨邊骨　猶是春閨攀裏人</p>
<p>暮色蒼茫中，記者由師部任參謀陪同，登寨牆巡視戰塲。大地上殺氣騰騰，寒風退人，極目四野，見死屍壘壘，野火點點，俯視寨壕，則赤水成渠，浮屍成堆，那慘象簡直不能看，也不忍看，我沈痛萬分，腦海中憶起了兩句舊詩：「可憐無寒河邊骨，猶是春　夢裏人！」含着淚，咬着牙，我被悲愴的情緒逼迫着下了城牆。</p>
<p>斷壓殘垣如鬼域　腥血破衣處處尋</p>
<p>寨里處處是人畜的死屍，處處是斷　殘坦，沒見一個居民，沒見一隻鷄狗，沒有一棵完整的樹，沒有一處不是血，彈痕班班，彈片纍纍，橫三豎四的樹枝，遍地都是，帶血的破衣，到處皆有。尋常百姓家，有牆無家，有房無窗，有窗無門，有門無人，他們死的死了，沒有死的逃了，人問竟變成鬼域了。</p>
<h3>福州新畫面　福州十日航訊</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　陳正予</p>
<p>黑色的老鼠與白色的米在福州鬧得天翻地覆，也成為福州的新聞中心。死亡，饑饉，誰不畏懼！去年福州大鼠疫，因為防患未周，在鼠下喪生的不知幾許？至今猶有餘悸，所以，今年防疫機關提早準備各種防鼠的必要措施，如普遍注射及鄕間巡廻防疫宣傳等，大有與鼠背城一戰之槪。日前本市舉行盛大之衛生展覽會，陳列各種死鼠標本，令人怵目驚心。參觀者達三萬人，可見福州人對老鼠印象之深刻了。</p>
<p>歸僑已集中　嗟嘆無船行</p>
<p>聞東各縣華僑以古田為多，由於行總及聯總之協助，上月初曾由萬福士輪遣送福州及其附近各縣華僑數百人返舊地重理行業。近閩省僑務處復會同行總閩處理緬甸各地之華僑遺送事宜，日來登記者數逾千人，經核准來榕集中者約五百人，遺僑專輸原定本月中旬到榕，近聞須俟下月始能撥輪來榕，此數近五百之華僑現集中於福州市內，聞短時期內不能走，皆蹙然有憂悒。近日市上時可見到上書「出國華僑專車」之車輛往返馳騁，蓋因彼等聚居市內，每日用專車送到台江區甩膳，於華僑本身，固感不便，於負責遺送之行總及聯總當局目亦負祖過重，一華僑向記者表示行總未充分準備前似不應遽爾集中，增加他們的旅途勞頓。</p>
<p>物價在狂跳　長途電話忙</p>
<p>邇來物價猛漲，糧價一馬當先。奢侈品貴了可以不用，飢腸轆轆，米則怎好不吃？福州的米價有如一匹野馬，無法控制，不特早晚時價不同，而且瞬息萬變，記者屬筆時米價已爬上十六萬元高峯。糧價一漲，市府照例來一套邀請各有關機關開會，決議抑制米價，或以少量的糧食低價拋出，但是，把握不住問題的核心，收效甚微。福州新聞界對市政當局加以責難，人謀不臧是根本問題，我們要正視現實才好。</p>
<p>因為米價的在漲，不少環境困難的人民已改吃雜糧了，而且，米　們乘機把雜糧也儘情地漲價，等到雜糧也吃不起時，那只有等待饑饉惡運來襲了。一般民衆無不為了糧價問題而發愁，市政府沒法，老百姓尤其無法。只有看那米蠹虫的活躍，他們滿臉殺氣，有如面臨大敵，軍機帷幄。福州長途電話近日生意特旺，候通電話者十之八九為富商巨賈，他們一令，殺奪了不少生機！他們幾乎在與市府鬥法。</p>
<p>八萬餘戶中　貧戶佔六萬</p>
<p>據含糊的統計福州八萬餘戶中貧戶佔六萬，當然，這些貧戶中有小貧，大貧，特貧之分，不過貧苦的情况相差並不太遠。最初，他們對行總所辦的救濟事業懷有滿腔熱望，可是，事實屢屢令他們失望，即以冬令救濟來說：開會，硏討，複核這漫長的行程，從冬天走到春天，仍然在「最近可以發放」中。這些貧戶在北風凜冽物價高漲下，益瀕飢寒交迫之悲慘境遇。記者巡視貧民區，彼等皆三五成羣，圍聚破屋之中，以殘枝木片舉火取暖，無論長幼均枯槁乏人形，日以乞取殘羹，或檢拾腐壞菜葉煮食為生。老邁者多已不願走動，對於死亡一事無所畏懼，對於「救濟」云云亦絕少興趣，提到冬賑，多漠然視之，眞是愧煞行總諸君。</p>
<p>福州救濟事業，辦得如何，大家心裏明白。行總閩浙分署前副分署長林榮森因舞弊凟職去了職之後，行總在閩機構及人事來了一决大變革，可是，行政效率仍未提高，人員官僚化與辦事衙門化是受指責的焦點。</p>
<p>計劃作點綴　闊斧來裁員</p>
<p>卅六年度是新的年度，各機關免不了要來一套洋洋灑灑的行政計劃，道路要修，水利要興，工商要管理，似乎凡百庶政，皆待舉辦。但是，最好不要提到錢來，像「馬兒又能跑得快，馬兒又能不吃草」一樣。省府今年預算僅有三百億，其中二百卅億要吃飯，餘下無幾，能够辦什麼呢？於是，計劃是計劃，姑且點綴點綴，省漁業局每年事業費不及百萬元，即為一例。這個年代，能够守成是第一流角色，大家以此相勗勉。</p>
<p>各機關裁員减政，做得雷厲風行，省黨部二〇四職員裁了四分之三，僅餘四十五人，省府去年九月裁了員，市政府已在醞釀裁員，市府稅捐處女職員數十人，市長表示今日市財政支　萬份，不若再兼辦家庭救濟，女職員恐將先上黑榜。員一裁，失業陣綫日見加强，福州今日失業問題相當嚴重。</p>
<p>停電宵小出賦歌食無肉</p>
<p>提起福州的電氣公司，令人頭痛不已！福州沒有自來水設備，新型的公用事業只有汽車與電燈，而電燈廠電機年老多病固為停電一大原因，而公司管理不當，亦授人以可評之際。福州電燈之所以屢屢停電，公司表示是特殊階級偸電過多，電機不勝負荷，而且，電費一再上漲，每度竟高達千元者，一般用戶須為偸電階級負担電費，不平之事，甯過於此。夜裏停了電，正是宵小活躍時，在黑暗中被竊者已發生多起，大者如南門兜大建國西裝店於停電時被竊呢料數十疋，福州人對電氣公司莫不有怨言。</p>
<p>福州報載有所謂特殊階級作祟，强購猪肉，造成屠商罷屠之情事，五日不知肉味矣。此特殊階級何許人也，大家心照不宜，好像是蒙面大俠似的。因為屠商罷屠五天，市府換失了近千萬元的猪稅，林森縣屠商把猪肉運到福州市用黑市價兜售，又產生了一個林森縣福州市劃界未淸的新弊端，福州人賦歌：「食無肉兮營義不足，出無車兮步履艱難」。</p>

<h3>政治情況複雜　泰遼北全貌　復員工作繁重</h3>
<p>— 長春十二日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>東北九省新地圖上的遼北省，是一個西北東南的長形走廊，東隣安柬，北面與吉林嫩江興安交界，西接察哈爾，南毗熱河遼寗，遼北共轄昌圖，海龍，遼源，黎樹，開源，西豐。西安，東豐，通遼，長嶺十縣及科爾沁右翼前中後三旗，科爾沁左冀前中後三旗，札賚特旗，庫倫旗，計八個蒙旗。面積八九，〇二一方公里，人口三，八六四，三二一人，遼北的行政問題頗不簡單，在它狹長的版圖上，蒙旗的面積佔了一半。由通遼西北行，就深入蒙古游牧民族的腹地了。（東北及熱河境內的蒙旗，通稱「東蒙」。）「東蒙」是一個社會狀態與內地隔離，而政治情况複雜的地區。</p>
<p>記得今年二月中，如荼如火的學生愛國運動，蔓延祖國大地，愛國靑年遊行示威的行列，顯示一座新的血肉長城的時候，在蒙古草原上，所謂東蒙人民自治軍正捲起一陣橫逆的旋風，這些成吉思汗的子孫，有史以來即有過不少的「暴風雨」的塲面，「東蒙自治」的司令台在科爾沁右翼前旗的王爺廟，而遼北就包含着這一個游離部份的神經中樞。</p>
<p>遼北的牟個省份，可以說是另一個社會，另一個政治單位和經濟單位，在「行政」上要兼顧到兩方面。遼北的復員工作，此較其他省份要繁重得多。自今年二月間國軍進入遼北，以迄於現在，遼北漸决復員以及今年度省政工作的展望，甚有可述者，茲分民政，財政，敎育，建設，蒙旗，各項述之於次：</p>
<p>民政工作　初基奠定</p>
<p>國軍進駐遼北，迄於現在，各縣市已次第接收，但收復各縣市，除四平市，西安，梨樹全面接收外，餘有少數街村為共軍盤據，擾亂地方。蒙旗接收了科爾沁左翼三旗，餘五旗尙在共軍控制中。最可注目的當然還是蒙旗，共軍曾向他們宣傳一番：煽動蒙民的離心力</p>
<p>光復後施政工作中地方自治初蕊的奠定，有兩次重要工作：一是成立省以下民意機構，一是辦理地方公職人員選舉，民意機構的成立步驟，在鄉召開屯班民大會，組織街村區民臨時大會，商討興革事宜。此項工作於去年八月上旬完成。籌辦市縣旗臨參會，辦理倉卒草率，有的縣份接收很遲，代表選舉難免有令人指責之處，有很多空額還保留後選。如此臨參會，僅祗是喚醒人民的注意而已，九月半旬至十月土旬各縣均吿成立。為隆重儀式起見，劉主席的「開幕」，「開會」，「閉幕」，三種訓詞一馬領先形式看起來是由上而下的民主。</p>
<p>省臨參會十一月五日選舉，十一日宣吿成立，情形與縣市旗臨參會大致相同、十二月十五日至二十二日第屆首次會議開會十天，槪括檢討省政工作，作種種建議，是調地方自治的初基。民衆對於選舉非常冷漢，一方面是敵偽十四年高壓政治的結果，另一方面，以今日的戰火燎原，民生不定，民衆呻吟於生活高壓之下，無暇顧及從政。</p>
<p>其次地政，工作頗為繁重複雜，在「八一五」後至卅五年二月的數月中，激烈的土地變革如風暴襲擊農村，中國人由日本人手裹把土地索回，共產黨由地主手裏把土地分給窮人，社會旣無法律可尋，一切作法失體常規，農村秩序十分紊亂。農民在土地變亂中翻跟頭，並沒有得到什麽好處。士地生產成果，都被暴亂者吞食，農村在迅速破產中，勞力缺乏，耕地荒蕪。日本人走了，共產黨走了，遺留下一筆土地爛帳待淸理，遼北省府分分三項：一，整理地籍圖册，二，處理地政未結案件，三，制定有關地政事項各種章則辦法，來調整地政及解決地權糾紛問題。</p>
<p>戰亂頻仍　民生難困</p>
<p>「民窮財盡」是今日遼北的宿影。光復以來，歷經變亂，民生窮困，達於極項。因為共軍的遼北盤據擾亂的結果，地方治安工作艱鉅。從省縣財政支出比率中觀之，撥保安地方團隊招募及經常費為大宗，卅五年度全省預算數約十億五千萬元，保安團隊支出的佔五億六千萬元，佔二分之一强。行政開支次之，縣市旗補助又次之。是以省與縣巿旗的經費都十分困難。當時僅由行轅每月接濟四百萬元，區區之數，維持省政尙成不足。省級財政隸屬中央，無獨立稅源，縣市旗自成系統，以大部農村業經收復，民困不堪，工商凋疲，稅收來源枯竭，經費窘拙萬狀，有的縣市旗長赴任的旅費都甚不充裕。</p>
<p>去年六月全國財政會議閉幕後，將田賦與營業稅劃歸地方稅征收，此為省縣經費之兩大來源，辦理情形分述於下：</p>
<p>田賦征實標準規定，以偽滿十二年度（即民國卅四年度）正附稅合併計算之數額為準。舊賦額每元征實高糧三十市斤，每斤以流通券五元折價。遼北全部收復後，全年可望征收三十一億元。去年度實收僅十三億元。各級分成標準中央得一成二，省一成六分八，縣（巿旗）及街村共為七成一分二。田賦征實未能達到預定數額，因農民流亡耕地荒蕪所致。比較關內的征實標準，東北較低，但以東北破壤之慘烈，較低之負担亦感嚴重了，遼北梨樹縣智珠村的農民首先起來，於去年底組成請願團，晋省請求豁免田賦，當由劉主席允减六成，代表不滿意，決定向東北行轅請願。這是農民在痛苦中熬煎沸騰起的浪花。</p>
<p>營業稅課稅總額三十五年度約十四億三千五百萬元，按現行營業稅率百分之一點五核算，營業稅總收入額的為六千六百萬元，因全省商業凋疲，商店多數倒閉，僅可按六成計算，實際可收入三千九百九十餘萬元。</p>
<p>遼北數稱倉庫地帶，糧石稅也是最有希望的稅收之一，省府已擬具收征辦法，送呈行轅核准後施行。</p>
<p>縣市旗財政需要浩大，而稅源不裕，行轅規定先就偽滿原有稅目課征，為體恤民困起見不加新稅，但因各縣破壤之慘烈，致稅收甚感困難，各縣收支均入不敷出，而虧損甚多。</p>
<p>此外地方稅中之使用脾照稅，牲畜捐，果實捐，均比照物價指數加以提高，對於地方財政補益不少。不動產取得捐，漁業稅，特產捐及土地稅等均行廢止。</p>
<p>蒙民經濟　極感苦悶</p>
<p>半個遼北的情勢還沒有安定，蒙旗與內部隔離太深，而且蒙民有他們的政治要求，並受外力因素的誘惑及暴力影響。目前除了軍隊能進入蒙旗之外，一般人都不能進入蒙旗，政府接收蒙旗仍以軍隊為前鋒，固此由於內蒙的特殊情形使然，但政治經濟不能配合蒙民的要求，實為很大的缺點。劉翰東主席對於蒙旗的知識有限，記者曾以蒙旗經濟問題請敎張嘉璈先生，他也說沒有硏究。今天蒙旗的兩大問題，一是蒙漢土地糾紛的問題，據蒙民表示，他們所保守的水草地帶已經是最後的生命綫，而漢人的移殖已威脅到他們的生命錢，「如為饑餓而死，寗願為羊羣而戰。」便成為政治口號。其次，是蒙民的牲畜毛皮在動亂的東北找不到市塲，由於交通之中斷，出田大成問題，這使蒙民損失慘重，要求打破經濟的苦悶，是政治衝動的重要因素。今日遼北首要問題，亦即在此。</p>

<p>路旁拋屍又一呼聲</p>
<p>編輯先生：在我們上下班必經的大道是呂班路和魯班路，魯班路是一條不潔的街道，在店舖和潮惠山莊（墳塲）間的一段，原先是空地，去年夏季來了一批難民，便在這路旁的空地搭上多少草舍權作住宅，他們生活簡陋，草舍裏面充滿着的是黑暗和汚濕，路旁佈滿汚水與垃圾，無人顧問，再由這草舍南首，潮惠山莊南端牆根外空地，那裹可以說是露天的停屍塲，很多人將死屍拋棄在那個地方，這些死屍多數是嬰孩的屍體，所以都用破草蓆袋草草地裹着，有的露手露脚，用木板匣的很少，我想裏面餓死的固然有，恐怕受傳染病而死的較多，甚且經常一停便要三五個星期以上無人收埋，給附近來往的民衆一大威脅，再下去天氣暖了，危險性允不堪設想，我們的機關，前會函知該區警察和市衛生局，經過了二個多星期，可是那些屍體依舊是堆着，我們的機關通常有外國顧問往來，我一想到他們如果發現這種情形，請問這是不是增添我們社會的汚點。</p>
<p>因此我借貴報的篇幅來揭露這個不人道不衛生的活地獄，我認為市政當局應嚴禁老百姓隨便拋棄死屍，並要隨時派人查看，已拋棄的屍體立即加以掩埋。（石一鳴）編者按：本月十四日問聲君有同樣呼籲，業已揭載，今一鳴君又作上項陳述，合再披露，以供衛生當局查看改善。</p>

<h3>亂離</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>據說歷史是循環的。這是一句非常殘酷的預言，每一個人都想否認，但似乎每一個人都沒有勇氣堅決地否認。「以古為鑑，可知興廢。」歷史本來要我們不去走那些舊路，但事實上卻是固執地執着些久已強人的苦味教我們嘗。而歷史底循環，也似乎成為鐵的事實了。</p>
<p>西周末年，對於政治的不安和時局的亂離，已經有很強烈的控訴了。「碩鼠碩鼠，逝將去汝。」這是逃亡者的呼聲。「我入自外，室人交遍謫我。」這是一個小公務負的哀號。「我瞻四方，蹙蹙靡所騁。」這是一個憂時者的慣語。雖然這些是兩千多年前的人所寫，但我們豈不她覺得這恰是昨天纔聽見人設過的語言嗎！</p>
<p>遠在千七百年前，有一個被內戰的亂兵所擄的婦女，名叫蔡文姬，用眼淚和血寫下了一首詩、題名為「悲憤」。我國詩人雖然以溫柔敦厚為教，但到了身歷最凄慘的境遇的時候，也就不得不既怨且怒了。「悲憤」詩所記、歷干七百年猶憬然在吾人眼前。</p>
<p>「卓眾來車下，金甲耀日光·平土人脆弱來兵皆胡羌。　野　城邑，所過皆破亡。斬截無孑遺，屍骸相撐拒。馬邊懸人頭，馬後載婦女。長驅西入關，迴路險且阻。還顧邈冥　，肝脾為爛腐。所略有萬計，不得令屯聚。或有骨肉俱，欲言不敢語。失意幾微間，輒言斃降虜。要當以烹刃，『我　不活汝」覺敢惜性命，不堪其　　。或便加極杖，毒楚參並下。</p>
<p>「且則號泣行，夜則悲吟坐。欲死不能得，欲生無一可。彼蒼者何辜，得遭此呃禍……』</p>
<p>差不多與「悲憤」同時，王　寫他的「七哀」詩，記仙十七歲時自長安去劉州時的見聞，也剛剛江董卓之亂。</p>
<p>「西京亂無象，豺虎方構　。復棄中國去，委身適荊蠻。復棄中國去，朋友相追　。出門無所見，白骨蔽平原！路有　婦人，抱兒棄草間。顧聞號泣聲，揮涕獨不還。『未知身死處，何能兩相完。』驅馬棄之去，不忍聽此音。南登灞陵岸，回首望長安。悟彼泉下人，喟然傷心肝。」</p>
<p>大亂的時候，做母親的至於棄掉兒女，凄慘地說：「未知身死處，何能兩相完！」這十個字，真是用無限鮮血寫出來的！凡是在卅三年經湘桂向西逃難的人，一定刻骨鏤心地領悟到這首詩的意義罷。當時我幸而是向南行，從六百里連山中間背負着三歲的女兒逃出來。但白骨蔽平原的慘象，我卻不止在一處看到。當我經過不久以前是幾十萬居民的繁盛的城市，而找不到一幢完整的故屋的時候，那心情是宛如與王粲同望長安了。</p>
<p>三十一年，我經過湘潭，長沙，醴陵一帶，正當農忙，田裏時見婦女工作。那一帶的風俗，婦女是向例不下田的。於是我記起桓帝時童謠：「小麥青青大麥枯，誰當　者婦與姑，君具車，請為諸君鼓嚨胡！」而杜甫也有類似的句子：「從有健婦把鋤犁，禾生隴畝無西東。」但描寫征役最慘的是陳琳的「飲馬長城窟」：「邊城多健少，內舍多寡婦。作書與內舍，便嫁莫留住。善侍新姑嫜，時時視我故夫子！」這樣血淚交迸的書札，近十年來又豈在少數！</p>
<p>寫亂離最凄切的是杜甫。他的三吏（石　吏，潼關吏，新安吏），三別（無家別，新婚別，垂老別），是應該列入世界上最真實的悲劇之內的。他自敘所經歷，如「赴奉先詠懷」「入門聞號咷，幼子饑已卒。」我幸而未曾到那步田地。但如「今夜鄜州月，閨中祗獨看，遙憐小兒女，未解憶長安。」如「妻孥怪我在，驚定還拭淚。夜闌更秉燭，相對如夢寐。」如「有弟皆分散，無家問死生。」如「嬌兒不離膝，畏我卻復去，」等等，則是每一回讀都不沉泫然的。「彭衙行」寫亂離中的行程，携妻絜子，　頓在艱險的路途，真是替我三十三年冬逃入金秀徭山寫照。想來今日還會有無數的人，讀這首詩，撫今傷昔，凄然流淚的。</p>
<p>「憶昔避賊初，北走經險艱。夜深彭衙道，月照白水山。畫室久徒步，逢人多厚顏，參差谷鳥吟，不見遊子還。痴女饑咬我，啼畏虎狼聞。懷中掩其口，反側聲　嗔。小兒強解事，故索苦李　。一旬未雷雨，泥滑相　　。旣無　雨備，徑滑衣又寒。有時經契闊，竟日數里間。野果充餱糧，卑枝成屋椽。早引石上水，暮宿天邊煙……」</p>
<p>就是以豔麗著名的李商隱也有如下的句子：「兒孫生未孩，棄之無戚顏。不復議所適，但願死山間。」作香奩詩的韓偓，也悲痛地吟着，「水自　　日自斜，盡無鷄犬有啼鴉。千村萬落如寒　，不見人家空見花！</p>
<p>八年抗戰一年復員，以及不知道到何時纔可以終止的內戰，使我們重讀這些一千年或兩千年以前的人的作品，恍如他們又生活在這個時代。西洋傳說有一種鬼死了之後，會重新回來：罪惡要一次又一次重演。但假如歷史真的是非循環不可的，則黃巢，安祿山，董卓的命運也是早已經註定了的。</p>
<p>古人豈不是早已經說過了嗎；「天道好還。」又說：「唯兵不祥。」又說：「夫兵猶火也，不賤將自焚。」又說：「可以載舟，可以覆舟。」到了某一限度，古代無知無識的柔順的人民也會說：「時日曷喪，予及汝偕亡！」總有一天，柔順的綿羊會變成兇猛的獅子。</p>
<p>這一個時代，是以血染成的，而血流愈來愈浩蕩。我姑借古人的句子，來賦這一段亂離的生活。高堂窺探，白髮斑然。我不敢說自己是否還有力量來賦新的詩，但我堅決地相信一定會有這樣的詩，而且我可以讀到。（三十六年二月）</p>
<h3>愛</h3>
<p>— 蘇聯.赫蓋爾</p>
<h3>書憤</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>抬起頭來，睜開眼來是一連串的討厭，無聊，詭譎，欺詐，……生活像一個綱，生活像一座囹圄，就把生命毫不吝惜地在埋葬。</p>
<p>無言，要說的話都已盡了。假使是個聾子，是個瞎子，是個啞子，我相信也不一定是痛苦，——不，我相信是幸福。幻造的世界，該多麼比這醜惡的現實的世界強。</p>
<p>我愛自由，我喜歡翱翔。我　　，我固執。——　，對這現實的世界，我憤怒。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰說：「為了愛，應當為了別人而生活。」是的，生活為了自己是為了愛的滿足，但是，生活只是為了消耗一些無聊的時刻，那又是為了什麼呢？我要問，那是為了些什麽呢？</p>
<p>沒有是非，沒有黑白，這就是世界。慾的橫流，利的爭奪，這就是社會。我也會燃起一支煙，吹着輕快的口哨，裝成快樂的樣子，但是，寄憤怒於悠閑，也更多添一些愁意吧了。</p>
<p>只有想是自由的，但是，因為這，我也更怕想。脈脈的思想像一支支的毒蛇，把苦汗儘灌注進生命。有福的人們啊，把思想都封閉起吧！</p>
<p>憤怒像火花，即使是遏壓，也依然在燃燒在醞釀着更偉大的光輝。是麼，真理永在，——它永在，我願它永在，為了它，把憤怒歛了起來，我們要勇敢地生活和捕鬥。</p>
<h3>燭火</h3>
<p>— 蔣敦</p>
<p>燭火，燃燒着自己，給人間以光亮。</p>
<p>燈熄了，揭開天藍色的窗幔，凝望着那滿天燦爛的星斗，靜靜地我在懷想：多少次這樣的夜晚，我將一切美好的理想與希望，都化成一顆顆銀色的星辰！遍佈在那院的天際，讓我的信仰向星空，永遠是那麼堅定，那麼虔誠！</p>
<p>「要用你的指尖，撫摩那天上的星辰！」這象徵着一切科學家哲人，詩人，崇高的理想啊！而我人們，生辰在地上的人，向上，向星空的憧憬，讓一切在痛苦中掙扎的人，獲得了不朽的信仰與無窮的希望！獲得了驚人的發現和發明，不絕的創作與創造</p>
<p>向星空是人的本能和意志，而人，在地上的人，他的命運卻永遠是一支發光的燭火，燃燒着自己，去追求那不朽的光明。願我們像一顆天上的星辰吧！因為，在人間，那燭火卻只是最後的灰燼！</p>
<p>一支燭火，明亮了，就劃破了一片黑暗！無數支燭火明亮了，即使是寒夜，那也是溫暖的啊！做一支燭火吧，那一切在黑暗中苦鬥的人們，燃燒着自己的青春，自己的生命，那血和淚的熬煎，不只溫暖了你自己，而且溫暖了無數的人羣。不僅明亮了你自己的心，而且明亮了無數的純潔的心靈。</p>
<p>每一個人，都像一支燭光，發散着溫暖，發散着光亮！每一個人都想做一顆星，每一個人，在人間，也將是一顆永恆的星辰</p>
<p>拉起了天藍色的窗幔，每一個我懷念着的友人，都像一顆顆明亮的星辰，閃爍在我的心中！點燃了一支燭火，在這漫長的冬夜裏，我寫下了為他們祝福的詩篇！我的生命正因着無數的人羣而燃燒着……</p>
<p>金色的燭光，映輝着晶瑩的淚珠，是天痛苦，也是無盡的歡欣！</p>
<p>我在燃燒着我自己，我在給人間以光亮！</p>
<h3>蜈蚣及其他</h3>
<p>— 夢農</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>詩人陸放翁，說過：「學詩當在詩之外」，這是一句　有價値的經騐談。推論開去，學做文章，也應該從文章之外努力學習。</p>
<p>懂得了這個道理，便也可以明白許多敎師為什麼不一定是作家，許多文法專家為什麼未必是大文豪的秘奧了。便也可以明白現代作家們為什麼提倡讀書要在書之外，以及不贊成靑年閱讀小說作法一類書籍作為創作捷徑的眞意了。</p>
<p>任何學問，決無捷徑可言。唯一的辦法，是開步走，是一步一步的走，是繼續不斷的走，即使開步的時候沒有路，只要走下去，也還是能够由自己的脚踏出路來的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>英國動物學家　開斯透（Lankester）是一個深於思索，精於觀察的科學家，他曾經很聰明地引用寓言詩一首，說明蜈蚣是一種會走路的多脚動物，牠自己壓根兒就不知道路是怎樣走的，但仍無妨於牠的走路的能力，有詩為證：</p>
<p>一條蜈蚣，出門優遊，</p>
<p>蝦　玩笑地向他開口：</p>
<p>請問您，哪條腿先走？哪條腿後走？</p>
<p>這一問，種種疑惑湧向蜈蚣的心頭，</p>
<p>直到後來，倦透，倦透，跌入了陰溝，還是不知道怎樣開步走。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>蜈蚣的疑惑，在牠自己所要跋涉的路程上，是障礙物，是絆脚石，一旦跌進了陰溝，便為蝦蟆們引為笑柄。</p>
<p>古學究們告訴後生，要寫好文章，須　聖經賢傳；新才子敎育靑年，要做好文章，須讀邏輯學或辨證法。其實呢，倘聽了前者的話，則至多只會引經據典，文章却未必「斐然可觀」；倘聽了後者的話，則意識即使正確，文章却總是充滿着口號，其為死的東西而非活的作品，實際上並無二致。</p>
<p>這樣的「作家」，除了跌進的陷阱或新的陰溝而外，似乎不容易發見別的路。</p>
<h3>題大千為目寒繪蜀山秦樹卷子</h3>
<p>— 謝无量</p>
<p>目寒吾兄前歲北遊，攬劍門諸勝，大千為圖其山川所經，又得諸名公為之賦詩，屢徵拙題，因循未有以報。連日喜聞窮虜摧伏之訊，益念目寒前此壯遊之不易得，走筆成歌奉寄，即希哂正，乙酉立秋後五日。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　184</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>沒有幹過特務工作的人，對於特務行動，大抵有兩種心理；一種心理，以為這種工作，極其神秘，所以對於這種工作的效果，免不子驚奇詫異；把工作的人，當了來無影去無踪的劍仙俠客。另外一種心理的看法，認為這種工作，不足稱道；不過是一些陰謀家，偷偷定下計劃，乘人不備，下一辣手而已，所以認為僅僅是陰暗面的鬼蜮技倆。</p>
<p>殊不知這兩種觀感，都是外行說話，沒有搔着癢處。不知道特務的行動，也如均力敵的對手方；一樣要事先運籌帷幄，計劃周密；一樣需要指揮得當，一樣需要器械精良；一樣需要將士用命，奮勇爭先。而尤其困難的一點，特務不同於軍事的，乃是單人匹馬，獨斷獨行的行動多，所以份子一複雜，忠誠不够，信仰不足，素養較差，質地欠優，往往因為一人失職，弄得全軍覆沒的事，都是有的。</p>
<p>我自從見到了w君之後，親眼見過他處理了幾件重要行動，覺得他是一位天才：不僅在特務一項上。如要呌他把這片用在特務工作上的心血才智，用在軍事上，必定成為名將，用在政治上，必是一等政治家，用在科學上，必是發明或新學理的探索者；用在商業或實業上，必是一位首屈一指的專家。</p>
<p>八點幾分鐘，我和　　虎城上樓，到w君的辦事處，碰見他正忙着發號施令；屋子裏站着十幾個人，還有一兩位坐着的；原來他這時正在佈置突擊的工作，分派小組，頒發指令。</p>
<p>那靜靜站着的十多位同志，大部分都在三十歲左右，也有一兩位是二十來歲的大學學生，兩三位四十多歲的職業界人物。但人人都是精神飽滿，氣度沉着。</p>
<p>w君這個組織，有一點比較奇特；好像沒有班底和角兒的分別，就如崑劇班的組織一樣，輪着一　　的主角，就是主角，不輪着主角時，跑龍套也來，塲面上敲大鑼也來；似乎有些一律平等的意味。却是也分有等級，不過分列等級的標準，不單單在資格一項上着想，多半依據訓練時的考績，試用時的能率，和正式服務時的功績，或升或降。薪給完全依照軍部待遇，高低等級的待遇，雖略略有些微的不同，然而大體上講，一律都只能得到一點淸苦的生活費而已。</p>
<p>我因最近住在這裏，接觸較多，所以關於w君的部下，認識了很多。這時，這十幾位同志當中，就有一位四十多歲的壯士，以前是北平警士，對於北平地方最熟，他今晚的職務，都由他佈置，連行動的最高級長官，也得聽他的命令。</p>
<p>我們進屋的時候，w君只略略點首招呼一下，便仍舊進行發令。他說話的聲音不高，却是字音正確，語句簡潔有力。一道命令，只頒佈一次，受命人複述時，如有含忽的地方，w君必定把這條命令，再複說一次。只要在旁邊靜心一聽，就知道w君眞有槃槃大才；口齒淸楚，思想敏捷而有系統。僅僅這麼一次小突擊的指揮，但從旁聽來，也覺得複雜紛繁，千頭萬緒；然而他却是抽絲剝繭，一絲不亂，可以證明他眞的心細如髮。</p>
<h3>讀「三毛從軍記」</h3>
<p>— 禮</p>
<p>在抗戰中，漫畫的進步是我們有目共見的。在文盲遜地的今日，一幅好的漫盡的功能更遠勝一篇深刻辛辣的雜文。可是，隨着社會環境的不安定，出版物的減少或緊縮，我們讀漫盡的機會也隨之而少了。——別說抗戰前專門刊戰漫畫的雜誌今日我們看不到，就是用彩式版作為插頁刊載的漫畫，我們今日能在幾本雜誌中看到呢？像葉淺予的「王先生」，張樂平的「三毛」，以及黃曉的「牛鼻子」等連續性的漫畫，那更是……</p>
<p>然而在不久前我們終於在本報上又看到了張樂平的「三毛從軍記」，這偵是令人喜出望外的</p>
<p>「毛是十年前的人物，按理十年之後，該已長成一表人才了，但是我現在仍舊畫三毛，而且畫老樣子的三毛，其原因便是我覺得三毛的生活環境，十年之中一成未變，十年前的三毛拾垃圾睡馬路，十年後的三毛依然不見進步，其精神上稍有不同之點，便是十年後的三毛學起大人模樣在馬路上兜生意，抽美國香烟屁股，喊「哈　！喬挨」了，三毛的問題既然如此的多，因此我覺得畫不完，寫不盡。」</p>
<p>作者在把他的從軍記「彙編成册」後，在第一集中的「自序」中這樣說。</p>
<p>「十年之中一成未變」，這是「三毛」的不幸嗎？還是作者的殘酷？抑域是我們所活着的道些人們的可悲呢？</p>
<p>「三毛從軍記」第一集的內容，是不必我介紹得的，因為早巳在本報上刊載過。我對漫畫是門外漢，當然也無從說到技術上的優點。我所能報吿的，是我有的一册己經給我的剛在讀小學一年級的小女兒要去了，成為向小朋友誇躍的珍寳，畫上沒有說明，可是她依然能够畫得頭頭是道</p>
<p>作為我的意見的，是我覺得「三毛」可以退伍了。戰爭的痛苦已經够使我們受不下去了，不論「三毛」是否已經長成一表人材，還是先讓他放下槍桿來吧，雖然他依然說不定導是恢復到「拾垃圾睡馬路」的生活，可是要他不「拾垃圾」不「睡馬路」，最緊要的還是得放下現在手裏的槍！</p>

<h3>「備案存查」</h3>
<p>— 葉蘅</p>
<p>「生產貸款」申請追記</p>
<p>上年，我和幾個友好，經營了一個小小的工廠；到年終，看到報上的消息，當局特地貸放二十億的「生產貸款」，來救濟上海的垂危的工商業，同時我們的工廠，正受到高利的困迫，便喜出望外的趕到四聯總處，詢問貸款的手續。</p>
<p>農曆年關，是每家行商的終結時期，要是這家行號不能在這個時期把欠人人欠的賬款結淸，那末，便有擱淺的可能·我們也正因為這個緣故，便把這「生產貸款」的獲得，來做我們工廠的命運，中問推定我專負這個中請貸款的責任。</p>
<p>第一次：我跨進了中國銀行的大鬥，摸索到了二樓「二一一八」室，那裏已是人山人海，每個人都懷有一顆希冀的心，同樣一張焦急的臉，向招待接洽的行員，探詢着塡表，調查，抵押，期限的各項急欲知道的問題。我靜靜地站在旁邊，不想發問，同時也很難插嘴發問，便這樣的退了出來。</p>
<p>第二次：我揀了個相近休息的時問，直上了他們的辦公室，掏出了我們工廠的銜片，誠懇地，虛心地，以獲得了我要知道的各點，結果：便是表格還沒有印好，須要等待三天以後，我惘然地跑出了中行大鬥。三天以後，我特別的早，趕在每個想獲得表格的人們之前，在雖非排隊，而官際很擁擠的狀態下，幸運地領到了一套表格，珍惜着小心翼翼地回歸了我們的工廠，——這是第三次。</p>
<p>在幾個人再番斟酌的塡就了中請書，編造了工廠的資產負債表，閒列了押品清單，再寫了一封辭意懇切的請求貸款書，這樣，我又第四次到了「二一八」室。幾個人的面容，眞太熟悉了；因為，他們和我是進行着同一的目標，可以說喜怒也是一致的；我把塡妥了的表單，遞進了一個行員的手裏，他淡描地瞧了瞧，他說：「一千五百萬元！」我接　　：「是啊！我們是小本經紀。」他把乎指點向收發處，我意會地，鄭重地送給收發光生，掣回了回單。</p>
<p>報上說，接受了聲請書後，一星期內便有人來調查，十天後便可領到借款，我們召集了全體廿幾個工友，說明如果有人來調查時，你們的精神應該奮發，工塲應該整齊淸潔，可以證明我們的工廠雖然不大，但是很有秩序，而且也很有希望。候到了第六天，相近年尾祗二天了，工友們都要求休息的那天，調查的人來了。我們便忙不迭的把賬簿，原料，存貨，一項一項的點騐，敬烟敬茶，以冀貸款的成功。</p>
<p>第二天：又來了一個機關的調查員，昭樣要這，要那，我們熟練地奉行，結果他也似有所獲的去了。隔一天，正是年卅，我禁不住跑到四聯總處，探詢我們的貸款會不會核准？明年最快能在幾時出來？一個簡單的回答，便是他們也不知通，我便算作第五次之行了。</p>
<p>過年以後，年初四便作了第六次之行，跑進了「二一八」室，已經面目全非，原來「生產貸款」已經結束了；前次調查的千餘件，聽說祗通過二十件，那末，我們，以及與我們同樣的小額貸款，恐怕是不會有希望了。但是，萬一，審核委員會的委員大人們來一側「好事」，或者還有希望，我糊裏糊塗地退出了辦公室，走廊上遇到了去年同來申請的人們。</p>
<p>農曆二月份已經開始，「生產貸款」好似石沉大海，懷着一顆絕望的心，我還是戀戀不捨地回憶起六度「中行」之行。</p>
<p>這是我們申請「生產貸款」的大概經過，現在雖然「生產貸款」已成為金潮聲中一個刺耳的名詞，但我總願意把我們申請的經過，照錄如上，備案存查。</p>
<h3>漏網之魚</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>李香蘭何以不引渡</p>
<p>根據一個駐東京的中</p>
<p>國記者之忠實報導，在麥克阿瑟管制下，曾經活躍於上海及東北的日本女間諜李香蘭（日名山口淑子），復出現於東京的街頭，而且憑着她那副咨色，出入交際塲所，與官兒們弄得挺熟，其活動東京的情形，尤勝於昔日在中國的作為。為了愛護我們的國家，這一個曾經帮助敵人殘殺自己同胞的女間諜李香蘭，應該立即引渡回國，否則，讓這條漏網之魚逍遙海外，將會造成未來的軒然然大波，</p>
<h3>再說打虎</h3>
<p>— 馬進</p>
<p>憶音日XX團東飛西走，僕僕於收復區通都大邑之間，當時會作壯語曰：「吾輩要多打老虎，少拍蒼蠅」，曾幾何時，落得言猶在，而事實全非。</p>
<p>以浩浩蕩蕩的雄大陣勢，結果亦不免偃旗息鼓尷尬　　，宜乎虎威益震於華夏，而彼蒼蠅者亦得嗡嗡於天下矣。</p>
<p>推而廣之，乃有這次的黃金潮。</p>
<p>日前以濟監察團於該團集會時，曾侃侃然言道：「我們必須具有打老虎的決心，對於操難保金融者予以打擊」。這話作嘔的受害者，眞是馨香禱祝之不暇的。</p>
<p>但打虎必須擊其要害，虎例，蒼蠅不待拍而就範，亦擒賊先擒王之理也。不幸據報載，當局似仍忙於捉拿馬路上的二三小蒼蠅開葷，所謂打虎云云，恐終不免於打草驚蛇投鼠忌器而已。</p>
<p>然而吾儕小民，却正拭目以俟打虎將的神通呢。</p>
<h3>野鶴無糧天地寬　一鳥集之三</h3>
<p>— 珠光</p>
<p>上海現有的島店一共不上二十家，大部份都開設在五馬路浙江路轉角，一般說來，店面都很狹小，因此也就更其顯得零亂，加以烏聲嘈雜，要不是道地的玩烏成癖者，單憑這些也就不敢領教了。</p>
<p>鳥行或島店，除了團名忍想，出賣烏類之外，莫不兼售烏籠與食缸等零件，據說鳥籠一項，也大有講究，最普通的當然是竹籠，每架從幾千元起至一二萬元不等。考究的也有用紅木製作的，再豪闊的那就在紅木的籠子上嵌鑲各稱彩色的玉石，此外，由於業務上的方便，他們也兼售其他的動物，諸如兔子，松鼠，癩蛤蟆，洋鼠（俗稱「洋老蟲」）等等。</p>
<p>這些烏行每日最多的倒不是去買烏買籠子而是買烏食的客人。說到烏食，通常的都以粟米穀麥菜子之類為最多，此外又有所謂「皮蟲」，「桑蟲」等樹皮上的蟲類作為食料，說是含有「滋補」的作用，一如人類之進服魚肝油。</p>
<p>這個風雅賣買的行業現在確實已到窮途末路的地步了，眼前外路根本也就沒有來，不說南洋與國外，就連常州楊州以及浙江杭紹一帶，近來到貨也稀少所以進貨困難。</p>
<p>過去玩烏的老爺們都以之消遺，現在可就完全不同了，人們飯都吃不飽，那來閒錢養烏玩？那些提着島箱趕茶會與鳥信的人們，雖說悠閒得有些不像樣，但又安知不是沒有工做的失業者？安知不是滿肚子裏納着悶？所以由於購買力薄弱以致生意冷淸淸。</p>
<p>道不上二十家的烏舖子，就這麼在山窮水黨的情形下挨日子，難怪一位年輕小夥計說：「烏兒一經給關在籠子裏便永遠沒得自由，其實我們在這社會裏又何嘗不是一樣？——還不及它們有人飼養呢！」</p>
<p>我了解這些話語的意義，只是我可不敢勾同他最後的一句話，人類與禽獸的區別就在這一點呀，可不是嗎？所謂：</p>
<p>「籠鶴有食湯獲近，野鶴無糧天地寬！」</p>
<h3>王熙鳳口中的燒餬的捲子</h3>
<p>— 珠光</p>
<p>燒餬的捲十，太不好吃，不要怪麵粉質料惡劣，要怪自已太太缺少府房經騐，沒有烹飪常職，現在惟一補救方法，重新調和麵粉，洗刷鍋爐，作第二次的嘗試。</p>
<p>綽號「潑辣貨」的王熙鳳，口齒伶俐，慣會說俏皮話，每一次發言，不是突梯滑稽，就是詼諧百出，　人妒煞愛煞。我每次讀紅樓夢　部，最喜歡看這位幽默美人的語調，洋洋　灑成串的笑話，活躍在字裏行間，呌人讀之，愛不忍釋。</p>
<p>「我倆是一對燒餬的捲子，我只配和他（指賈璉）在一起混」。這是王鳳姐某一次對人自謙的談話，語氣的解釋，不過是燒餬的捲子，不成材料，買　這樣不成器的人，只配她和他在一起混。</p>
<p>熙鳳越是這樣謙和自卑，越顯出她矯揉造作的風情，撒嬌撒痴，活現出一位靈心慧舌的美人；燒餬的捲子，經過這位幽默美人香口說出，再加上曹雪芹先生生花之筆一點染，不是一種不成材料的東西，簡直成了一塊輕鬆可口的香香餑餑了！</p>
<p>現在我們拿着一塊燒餬的捲子，不堪下噎的時候，環觀國內情形，勝利後的今日，國家一切情形，應該和初出籠的熱饅頭一樣，蒸蒸日上，但是工商業正　着不景氣，經濟枯窘，百物昂貴，漲風，倒風，成了普遍的流行性的眞性霍亂，療漢滿目，不堪收拾，這種情形，不是一隻香噴噴的熱饅頭，簡直和一塊燒餬的捲子沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>「捲子」已經「燒餬」了，我們怎樣重新調和麵粉，再作嘗試呢？（徐小庭）</p>
<h3>質疑</h3>
<p>— 悲天</p>
<p>謹致市參議會</p>
<p>（一）本市各電影院最近擅自漲價，違背功令，影響平民娛樂，社會局置若罔聞，為什麼市參議會也不加制止？</p>
<p>（二）市立學校為了安定教職員生活起見，徵收學術進修補助金，為變相尊師金甚明，遠背參議會決議，加重市民負担，教育局竟予核准，為什麼市參議會也不加制止！</p>
<p>謹候市參議會答復。</p>
<h3>思想可以保持青春（上）</h3>
<p>— 學譯</p>
<p>不論你是什麼樣年紀的人，衰老的恐懼往往會隨時隨地的來襲擊你。因為我是專門研究年齡問題的咨詢心理學家，我發現在我的許多顧客之問，大都是些三十歲左有的仕女們，地們眞是己經被那與日俱增的年齒所煩惱着，他們想學習那避免衰老的方法，因此在這裏我吿訴他們，假使你已經是十七到七十歲之問的人，而你對於想保持靑春有感覺興趣的話，請你慢慢的讀下去，也許這會對你有些益處。</p>
<p>在我還未將方法吿訴你們之前，最好先將那幾條理論解釋一下：</p>
<p>第一，年齡不能以歲數來計算，因為人類生理上所表現的時問往往同鐘　上的時間不相符合，人類生理上的衰老現象，因年歲的增長而緩慢，這就是說你的歲數愈大，你的年齡就愈變得慢，愈老得慢。事實上在三十到四十歲時，你生理上的變化終要比你二十五到三十歲時候的生理上的變化緩慢些，而五十五歲到七十歲又要比四十到五十五歲慢些了。</p>
<p>日曆之所以不能表示人類眞確的年齡，其另一理由，就是人類身體上各部組織衰老的速率也各不相同。一般的講起來，人類的視覺，在十多歲就發育完全，聽覺在二十多歲發育完全，到了三十歲，筋肉，體力，生殖力，以及身體內的新陳代謝都發育到最高峯，但同時你的思想，雖到了五十歲却依舊年靑，且繼續不斷的發長着。至於人的腦力，則須再過十年，方始發育到極端。從六十歲起腦的效率方始漸漸下降，直到八十歲，到了八十歲，你的智力仍和三十歲時一樣，並且另外有一種新的思想力產生。老年人的記憶力雖　　去，可是他的思想力却不受限制，相反的年齡愈大，他的見識愈豐富，眼光越遠大，判斷力及理智亦愈準確豐富，這些過去的經騐都可帮助我們解決難題。總而言之，我們是獲得了智慧，這乃吿訴你那些年老的醫師，多　歷的律師，以及經騐豐富的工匠等之所以仍然能和那些年輕力壯的後生們相對的理由。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupts Around Jinan; National Army Recovers Fei County Yesterday Afternoon; Western Shandong Enters a Stage of Political Pacification</h3>
<p>[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 25th] The National Army has completed new deployments to defend Greater Jinan. The troops in the suburbs have doubled, ensuring safety. Qingdao, Ju County, and other important strongholds also have strong troop deployments. To realize the new deployments, the National Army has made strategic retreats in some other areas. The war situation is such that the Communist forces' attempt to invade Jinan is extremely obvious. Major battles have been unfolding around Jinan for days. The National Army has issued strict orders to counterattack, and victory is in sight. On the evening of the 24th, the Communist Sixth Brigade and local forces, totaling over 3,000, fiercely attacked Yancheng. As of noon on the 25th, fierce fighting was still underway. Contact continues in Dangjiazhuang, Zhonggong, and other places.

Fierce fighting continues near Zouping, Changshan, Zhoucun, Linzi, Liuchuan, and Boshan. The town of Zhoucun has fallen into the hands of the Communist forces. Jinan City has now entered a wartime state, and prices are soaring. The authorities have taken necessary military measures.</p>
<p>[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 25th] On the night of the 24th, three regiments of Communist forces fiercely attacked Yancheng.

Another unit of Communist forces attacked Jihe, starting on the night of the 24th and retreating on the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 25th] The Communist New Fourth Army, trapped in the Yimeng Mountains, is now disrupting Laiwu and Boshan, apparently seeking to build a corridor from the north to connect with Liu Bocheng's forces in Feicheng, Dong'a, and Shouzhang in western Shandong, as well as the Communist forces in Jiaodong. The National Army is currently implementing isolation tactics to defeat them one by one. Furthermore, various counties in western Shandong have entered a stage of political pacification. Moreover, the National Army advancing along the Jinpu Railway is advancing swiftly. Yesterday afternoon, they crossed the Beisha River, and on the 25th, they arrived at the southern outskirts of Zou County.

<h3>Cavalry Division of the Twelfth War Zone Enters Hebei; Deployed to the Area of Xushui; Fierce Fighting Near Xiaozhan in Southeastern Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Chen Jicheng went from Zhuozhou to Gucheng today to inspect the front lines of Yaocun. The Communist forces in Suicheng and Mancheng have deployed five brigades, with small groups occasionally harassing the area. The battle for Mancheng has temporarily subsided.

<h3>Threat to Xi'an Lifted</h3>
<p>Reports of National Army Attacking Yan'an Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Recently, there have been rumors that the National Army is launching an offensive towards Yan'an. This reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the situation. According to the spokesperson, the Communist forces in Shaanxi attacked the National Army in the Tongrun Town area west of Chunhua on January 25th and captured the town on February 2nd. They then regrouped their forces in an attempt to threaten Xi'an. Furthermore, the Communist forces have recently been using Malan Town as a base to sell drugs within the National Army's territory, forcing the National Army to counterattack. The fighting lasted for three days, from the 18th to the 21st, and the aforementioned threat has been lifted, and the fighting in that area has come to an end. The rumor that the National Army is about to attack Yan'an is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] Since the Communist Yan'an headquarters issued a general mobilization order for the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 20th, in addition to actively expanding military strongholds in western Shanxi and southern Suiyuan, its troops in the Guanzhong District, with Malan Town as the center (where the Communist Guanzhong Special Commissioner's Office is located), have been developing in the east, west, and south directions, completely exposing their attempt to seize Xi'an and Xianyang. As evidenced by the general mobilization order from the Yan'an headquarters, this action is a planned invasion. The National Army began its counteroffensive on the 18th of this month and, after days of fighting, recovered Malan Town, the capital of the Communist Guanzhong region, on the 20th, effectively sealing off this pocket-shaped area.</p>
<h3>Freight Train on the Beining Railway, Jin-Yu Section, Derails After Being Blown Up</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 25th] At 10:00 PM on the 24th, a freight train on the Jin-Yu section of the Beining Railway was detonated between Jinshui River and Chadian. Eleven freight cars derailed, destroying over 50 sections of steel rails and over 200 ties. Some of the goods on the train were looted by bandits. The destroyed tracks were repaired by the afternoon of the 25th.</p>
<h3>Communist Li Xiannian's Forces Attempt to Flee to Sichuan Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Repelled by Garrison After Reaching Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch] After being repelled by the security forces in Badong, Hubei, Communist Li Xiannian's forces recently showed a trend of sneaking into Sichuan. Over 2,000 of their vanguard troops have sneaked into Wuxi, Sichuan. They were immediately defeated by the 28th and 29th Regiments dispatched by the 10th Division of the local garrison and have now retreated to the border area between Wushan and Sichuan-Hubei. According to Wang Yuanhui, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Government Security Department, in a report at the expanded commemorative week of the Sichuan-Kang-Qian-E Border Pacification Headquarters, Li Xiannian's forces are weak and unable to flee to Sichuan. Currently, the National Army in northern Sichuan has advanced to the Shaanxi and Hubei provinces, implementing strict defense. The troops of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei Border Pacification Headquarters have also extended their defense lines, separately defending against possible infiltration routes of the Communist forces. If the Communist forces attempt to move towards Sichuan, they will undoubtedly be annihilated.</p>
<h3>Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Project Extended to East of Liuhe</h3>
<p>Bian-Xu Train Expected to Resume in Ten Days</p>

There are many Japanese and Korean people in the Communist forces, and they are equipped with new-style weapons from a certain power. (4) General Sun Liujin will go to the front to command the battle. The Communist forces will surely be defeated within a week.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changchun, 25th dispatch] (1) The Communist attack on Jiutai is increasingly urgent. Communist troops have been detected about five miles from Jiutai. (2) The Changde section of the Zhongzan Road, between Buhai and Halaha, has been occupied by Communist troops.

(3) Over a thousand Communist cavalry troops once roamed Wanbaoshan and retreated after a fierce battle with National troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 15th dispatch] Jilin Chairman Liang Huasheng flew back here from Shenyang this afternoon. He immediately discussed the current military situation with the heads of various garrison troops and local forces.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th dispatch] According to front-line news from National troops, the Communist forces are increasingly transporting supplies from Dalian to Yantai, Shandong.

<h3>Tani Hisao Tried for the Second Time: Defendant's Request to Extradite Witnesses to China Rejected; Debate Court Set to Resume on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Tani Hisao, the main perpetrator of the Nanjing Massacre, was publicly tried for the second time on the 25th. The debate began at 9 AM, with Shi Meiyu continuing as the presiding judge. It ended late in the evening, but the entire debate was not completed. It is scheduled to continue on March 3rd.</p>
<p>Ogassawara Ao's Testimony</p>
<p>When the defendant Tani was escorted to court, his expression was the same as before. The presiding judge announced that the defendant had previously requested permission to extradite Japanese witnesses Shimon, Tanabe, Itagaki, Yanagawa, etc., to China to testify, but because they had all participated in the war, their testimony had no value, and the application was rejected. Ogassawara was questioned in detail regarding his participation as a witness and how he was able to understand the situation of the Nanjing Massacre. Ogassawara replied that when he was studying at the Army University in Japan in the past, he had studied the process of attacking Nanjing. He was then dispatched to Nanjing as a staff officer, and after arriving in the defensive areas of Yuhuatai, etc., he confirmed that his research was correct. When asked "Was Tani Hisao the first to enter the city?" he replied that the Zhongshan Gate was breached first, and then the Zhonghua Gate. At this time, the defendant Tani again requested permission to summon Japanese witnesses, otherwise there would be no fair trial. The presiding judge said: Is the defendant's unit responsible for the Nanjing Massacre? The court has not yet ruled on whether the defendant is responsible for the killing of more than 300,000 people in Nanjing. How can it be said that it is unfair?</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Truth in the Besieged City</p>
<p>A powerful piece of evidence was then presented, which was sent by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, a book titled "Tears of Blood in the Fallen Capital" written by Guo Qi, who is now at the Army University. It described the facts of the massacre in the city. Guo participated in the battle and struggled to escape from Nanjing for three days. The killing situation was roughly as follows: (1) More than 30 civilians were forced into an ice-covered pond to catch fish. If they obeyed, they would freeze to death in the pond. If they did not obey, they would be killed; (2) An old man was hung from a tree with a rope and used as a target, and the old man was shot to death; (3) After the Japanese army raped a woman, they forced her son to rape his mother and clapped and laughed beside them; (4) A 17-year-old girl disguised as a man to leave the city, but was discovered. She was immediately raped. At the same time, a Chinese person passed by, and they were ordered to rape her. When the four people refused and were begging, a monk passed by, and they immediately ordered the monk to rape her. The monk refused and was killed with a knife; (5) Every night, the Japanese army would form groups of three or five, cross the safe zone, residential areas, and climb over walls to rape, which was called "fishing"! (6) Women were deliberately lured out, and then at night, they would go to their residences to rape them, which was called fishing. Then Guo Qi was summoned to testify about what he had witnessed at the time.</p>
<p>Investigation of Japanese Army Atrocities</p>
<p>The presiding judge then announced the Japanese army atrocities investigated by the International Committee, totaling 425 cases. There were 190,000 people who were collectively massacred, more than 100,000 people who were sporadically massacred, and 816 cases with records, including 368 cases in the Zhonghua Gate area. The defendant Tani quibbled, saying that there was fierce fighting at the time and that there were no residents in the Zhonghua Gate area at all, let alone women. The presiding judge immediately asked if he could guarantee that he had not killed a single person during his time in Nanjing. The defendant Tani had no answer. It was already 12 o'clock, and the judge announced a recess.</p>
<p>Tani Quibbles Persistently</p>
<p>The court resumed at 2 PM. The defendant Tani first responded, speaking for two hours, quibbling throughout. Summarizing his meaning: (1) The area was not within his defensive zone, (2) There were no residents during the period of fierce fighting, so no massacre could have occurred, etc., with seven points of argument, using "fabricated," "untrue," "vague," and "deliberately forged" as adjectives, and insulting the court, calling this unfair trial unprecedented in the world. Finally, he insisted that summoning Yanagawa was a sacred matter, and that this situation was simply a stain. The defendant could not accept it willingly. Throughout his entire defense, he repeated the sentence, "At that time, there was fierce fighting in the Zhonghua Gate area, and there were no people at all, so this could not have happened!" eleven times. The presiding judge stopped him from speaking.</p>
<p>Lawyer Argues for the Death Penalty</p>
<p>Lawyer Mei Zuguang then argued on behalf of the prosecution, stating briefly: The defendant was one of the unit commanders and could not be held solely responsible for the crime of the massacre. It could not be said that he had committed the crime of destroying peace and violating humanity. Prosecutor Chen Guangyu then responded to the various points quibbled by the defendant, mainly as follows. The defendant made the following points in his defense: (1) He was leading troops in China, (2) His military discipline was good, (3) He did not know about the massacre in advance, (4) He was not responsible for his defensive zone, (5) It was vague and uncertain, (6) There was no one in Zhonghua Gate at that time, etc., but (1) the orders of the Dharma were not to be obeyed, (2) if the defendant's military discipline was good, whose military discipline was not good? (3) Was the defendant responsible for the killing of more than 300,000 people in Nanjing? (4) Was the defensive zone designated in advance? Was there an order? Was there a document? (5) The documents we presented were not forged, so the defendant was indeed guilty of violating humanitarian crimes, destroying peace crimes, and war crimes, and we argue that he should be sentenced to death. It was already 6 PM, and the presiding judge announced that the debate would resume at 2 PM on March 3rd.</p>

<h3>After Signing and Responding to My First Note, the Philippine Foreign Minister Reaffirms His Position; Whether to Resume Negotiations Depends on China's Attitude</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 25th dispatch] Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino declared today, after the Chinese Envoy to the Philippines delivered the reply note, that it is reasonable for the Philippines to request the inclusion of a reciprocal clause in the draft treaty of friendship. According to his disclosure, the Chinese government insists on including a most-favored-nation clause in the draft. If so, all the advantages granted to China in the treaty will force the Philippine government to grant the same conditions to other third countries at the same time. However, the Chinese note has already recognized that the benefits granted by the Philippine government to the United States and its people should be treated separately. Quirino said that the Chinese Envoy opposed the reciprocal clause with the following wording: "Under similar circumstances, if China allows the same benefits to other third countries, these benefits should be given to the Philippines under the same terms and conditions." Quirino insisted that the clauses supported by the majority of Filipinos were proposed after careful consideration of our desire to eliminate disputes. He solemnly stated: If this proposal cannot be accepted by China, we hope that China will consider the reasons for the rejection based on the merits of the proposal, and not say that the negotiators on the non-government side lack sincerity.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th dispatch] When Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Averica was asked by this agency's reporter whether there was any possibility of resuming negotiations now that Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino had stated that the Philippine government's "attitude towards China is extremely friendly" and that it was prepared to resume negotiations to reach a treaty that would satisfy both countries, he replied: "Whether to resume negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty depends on the Chinese government." He said that "the Chinese government is the one who stopped these negotiations." When discussing the four Filipinization laws that discriminated against overseas Chinese mentioned by Chinese officials in the press, Aversa argued that only one of the four laws had been finalized as law.</p>
<h3>Saigon Fire</h3>
<p>It Was Someone Who Deliberately Set the Fire</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Request the Consul to Intervene</p>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 24th dispatch] A fire broke out in the Jiang'an district of Saigon last month, leaving 18,000 Chinese and Vietnamese people homeless. After the incident, overseas Chinese found incendiary bombs at the fire site, which proved that someone deliberately set the fire. Therefore, the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese have petitioned the Chinese Consul General, requesting him to negotiate with the French side for protection. According to Dai Kuisheng, Vice Minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of China, who inspected Nanyang and arrived here, 8,000 overseas Chinese suffered significant losses in the French-Vietnamese negotiations in Vietnam. In the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations in Indonesia, thousands of overseas Chinese died. Dai said that during his visit to various countries in Nanyang, he also discussed issues such as immigration restrictions with Myanmar and Siam.</p>
<h3>There is Only One Doctor for Every 80,000 People in Our Country: United Nations Expert Elso Speaks</h3>
<p>[United Nations, San Francisco, 24th dispatch] United Nations medical expert Elso, who spent a year and a half in China, returned here today. According to him, three-quarters of the deaths in China can be saved at an extremely low cost. The remedies are nothing more than promoting hygiene, improving nutrition, and increasing the number of doctors. Elso believes that the situation in China is "terrible," with only one doctor for every 80,000 people, while in the United States, there is one doctor for every 1,500 people. The United Nations' medical assistance to China is not being handled properly. American food in Shanghai is cheaper than here, especially canned meat, biscuits, and the like, but it is still not within the purchasing power of ordinary Chinese people.</p>

<h3>After Negotiations, Most of the Chinese Ships Detained by the Dutch Navy Have Been Released; Negotiations are Still Underway for the Remaining Three Ships</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Regarding the detention of Chinese ships by the Dutch Navy in the coastal waters of the Dutch East Indies on the grounds of violating anti-control regulations, according to relevant sources, there are two batches of ships detained. The first batch consisted of 22 ships detained successively from July last year, and the second batch consisted of 12 ships detained successively from the end of December. Although most of the ships were registered in Singapore, our government has always done its best to negotiate. The person in charge of this matter is Chiang Chia-tung, the Consul General in Batavia, while Wu Bosheng, the Consul General in Singapore, is responsible for liaising with the local authorities in Singapore and negotiating with the Dutch representatives in Singapore. As a result of the negotiations, all 22 ships in the first batch have been released, while 3 of the 12 ships in the second batch have not yet been released. In addition to ordering the Consul General to continue negotiating locally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also urged the Dutch government to order the Dutch East Indies Navy to release the detained three ships as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Supreme Court Rejects Zhou Fohai's Appeal, Providing Reasons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Zhou Fohai's appeal was previously rejected by the Supreme Court. On the 24th, the reasons for the rejection were sent to the High Court, which forwarded them to Zhou on the same day. Zhou's wife, Mrs. Yang, previously raised three grounds for appeal: (1) Witnesses Peng Chun and Cheng Kexiang have not yet been brought to justice, (2) When the enemy army attacked Dushan, the defendant provided central intelligence, (3) He had set up a secret radio station to provide central intelligence, and after the surrender, he was the captain of the Shanghai Action Team, etc. Although the original trial sent a letter to the Central Organization Department to investigate, it proceeded to a verdict without receiving a reply. The main points of the Supreme Court's reasons for rejection are as follows: On November 4, 1939, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court had already issued a clear arrest warrant for Zhou. According to the Regulations on the Trial of Traitors, one must surrender before being discovered. Zhou had already surrendered after the clear arrest warrant was issued. Even if Cheng and Peng were brought to justice, it would only be a reference for sentencing. As for the provision of central intelligence, etc., it is also a matter of sentencing and cannot be used as a reason for requesting a retrial.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Some Thoughts on National Education Funding</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Recently, educators in Nanjing held a gathering specifically to discuss national education funding. We deeply feel that national education funding has reached its end, and national education is on the verge of bankruptcy. We really cannot understand why education, which is most urgently needed in China, is so weak. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly called for "Education First." Regarding constitutional governance, he said, "First, the people who exercise political power must have the ability and habit to grasp and ensure political power." This ability and habit must be cultivated through universal education to prevent being manipulated by ambitious individuals and to avoid encroachment of administrative power on political power. Only then can administrative leaders be supervised by the people, and their stay or leave be determined by the people. Whether for resisting war or building the nation, whether for one-party politics or multi-party politics, the indispensable prerequisite is an educated populace. Only when there is equal opportunity in education and everyone receives education can the country and society have a modern foundation.</p>
<p>We regret the fragility of economic and financial policies and, even more so, that educational policies, though existing, are equivalent to nothing. National education has gone from anemia to a state of blood poisoning, not only lacking the strength to nourish and assist but even being intentionally or unintentionally damaged from time to time. The reports and discussions of various experts are indeed enough to worry us. During the late Qing Dynasty, part of the primary education funding came from school properties managed by the mountain education promotion agencies, which were well-managed. After the establishment of the Republic of China, it was placed under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau, which dared not touch it even during the warlord era. When implementing the new county system, the Education Bureau was abolished, and finances were unified in collection and expenditure. Local education funding plummeted from 30-40% to 5%. This year, the situation has worsened further. County budgets only list central national schools, and the funding for general national schools is to be raised by the townships and villages themselves. How can the impoverished townships and villages today afford it? Schools have no choice but to close down. Speaking of the establishment of central national schools, it does not follow the rule of one school per township. Often, there are multiple deductions, and the county magistrate's performance evaluation only accounts for 5% in education. Even if all the schools in the county close down, it still cannot shake his "good words I do it myself."</p>
<p>This year, the central government's education budget is 340 billion yuan, accounting for 3.6% of the total national expenditure. The Ministry of Education can only stipulate 400 million yuan to subsidize national education, which is a drop in the bucket. Moreover, there are more than a dozen national education experimental zones waiting for this money. The Ministry of Education seems to have decided not to subsidize national education funding in each county anymore. They also considered that school land and properties are often pocketed by local bullies and gentry. There is no problem with the central subsidy reaching the province, but problems arise when it reaches the county. It is unknown how many deductions will be made.</p>
<p>This situation has created a phenomenon where, on the one hand, universal education is advocated, and on the other hand, people cannot attend school even if they want to. According to the Ministry of Education's report to the Legislative Yuan, in 1946, the number of out-of-school children nationwide reached 60 million. This loss is more serious than the abandonment of 600 million mu of good farmland. What can be used to redeem this loss? In the same year, the number of literate people nationwide was 87,572,464, and the number of illiterate people was 286,332,536, with illiteracy accounting for 76.58%. The situation is even worse than in 1942, 1943, and 1944. In these three years, the percentage of literate people was close to 50%. These are the figures from the "National Education Statistics Compilation," which should be roughly correct.</p>
<p>In places that claim to have developed education, such as Shanghai, there are over 400,000 school-age children. The 222 municipal schools can only accommodate 81,904 children, and the 952 private schools accommodate 189,823 children. There are still about 200,000 children out of school. Nanjing currently has 108 public and private primary schools, which can accommodate 50,000 children, and there are still 50,000 children wandering the streets without schools to attend. Only one-fifth of the children in Jiangsu Province are enrolled in school. Guangdong Province has a population of 30 million, with over 4 million school-age children. Currently, there are 5,000 national schools, and only over 2 million children enjoy the blessing of attending school. The other 2 million children are excluded from the school gates. The Yellow River flood limits the seven provinces, and the Yangtze River disaster stops at nine provinces. However, the disaster of out-of-school children caused by the backwardness of schools is especially severe for first-graders who have just entered school. However, today, they must take exams. After taking exams at one school after another, they have lost several pounds of weight, and their eyes are sunken. How can fragile children withstand this kind of exam burden?</p>
<p>It would be fine if they could pass the exam, but the result is that they dare not take the exam. Therefore, parents follow behind the principals, begging bitterly, tears streaming down their faces. Many primary school students have cried their eyes swollen for admission, and many parents have broken their hearts for their children's admission. They continue to go through connections, speaking of favors. Schools cannot bear the name cards and introduction letters of people and dare not openly enroll students, resulting in the so-called "educational black market" and "favoritism in education." Even for children who can attend school, it is not a comforting thing. Because education is currently regressing. The main reason for the regression of education is the regression of teachers. In 19 provinces, unqualified national education teachers account for 46%. There are a total of 620,000 primary school teachers nationwide, but only 82,000 are graduates of normal schools. There are 85,000 primary school graduates teaching in primary schools. The treatment of teachers is not as good as that of office clerks. Who would be willing to stay self-defensively and suffer, suffer, wither, and die in the education field? Under this situation, will today's children not become "tomorrow's vagrants"? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad. Everyone is busy solving the problem on their shoulders. No one is willing to take care of the century-long plan of education. Precisely because of this, I want to launch an educational atomic bomb! Bombard out funds to save the next generation, act illegally to save this old country. My opinions are:</p>
<p>1.  The central government must thoroughly implement the policy it has already set down. Avoid having policies without methods or having methods without implementation. Even more, avoid this order overturning that order, this resolution overturning that resolution, and this person's method changing to that person's method. Avoid encroaching on urgently needed funds to decorate the façade.</p>
<p>2.  In reality, the central government should account for 15% of education expenditures, the provinces 25%, and the localities 35%. The central government should account for one-quarter of the subsidy for national education funding, the provinces one-quarter, and the localities two-quarters.</p>
<p>3.  Finance is the mother of all administrations, and finance is the redistribution of people's income. Under the system of unified collection and expenditure, we cannot advocate "independent education funding" alone. However, the money allocated to education should pay attention to precedents and regulations. At least, the education funding taken from school land and properties should still be used for education. If this cannot be done, there is only the movement for independent education funding.</p>
<p>4.  Fiscal and economic policies must be closely coordinated, using finance to cultivate the economy and using the economy to increase finance. When the people are poor, wealth must be exhausted. To enrich the country, we must first enrich the people. The government cannot only focus on increasing tax revenue and ignore the cultivation of tax sources. Only by cultivating tax sources can education funding be secured.</p>
<p>5.  Improve the tax system. Ensure the concentration of authority. "Reforming taxes is more important than increasing taxes." Those who have not yet started levying taxes should do so as soon as possible. Those who have already started levying taxes but are pocketing the money should be clarified as soon as possible. This will not only increase taxes but also increase the people's sense of obligation. Only by doing this can education funding avoid being at a loss.</p>
<p>6.  School land and properties are mostly controlled and occupied by local bullies and gentry, which affects education construction. It is urgent to clean them up with the help of upper-level agencies and public opinion organizations. Capable educators should participate in public opinion organizations, overthrow local bullies and gentry, and unite the good forces to form a trend everywhere and confront the evil forces openly.</p>
<p>7.  There are currently over 44,000 normal school students and 110,000 simple normal school students, less than 160,000 in total. Assuming one teacher teaches 25 children, we should urgently train 2 million teachers to universalize national education. At the same time, the county magistrate's performance evaluation should account for 30% in education, so that he has concerns and is afraid of them. The Education Bureau should be restored and its organization strengthened.</p>
<p>Fichte said: Everyone should receive education, and everyone should manage education. Now is the time for the people to receive education and for the people to manage education. I remember that the Director of Education of Georgia, USA, Gu Linsi, because the treatment of teachers was meager, had already had 6,699 teachers change careers and retire in 18 months. In January of last year, he asked the Legislative Yuan to increase teachers' salaries by 50%. At that time, all newspapers called Gu's move an "educational atomic bomb." He pointed out that this matter was difficult to handle because education expenditures already accounted for half of the state's revenue. Soon, the parents of farmers, workers, and businessmen from all walks of life painfully grasped the pros and cons and printed small booklets for publicity by teachers donating two yuan each. Fighting until January of this year, they finally achieved their goal. It can be seen that things are done by people. We hope that this atomic bomb can also exert its power and blast out a bright future from the dead end.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Conscripts 500,000 Young Men in Occupied Areas of Korea, Hodge Reports on the Truth of the Korean Situation During His Return to the United States for Duty, Rhee Syngman Advocates Armed Implementation in South Korea</h3>
<p>[This News Agency, Washington, 24th] General Hodge, Commander of the U.S. Military in Korea, stated here that the Soviet military authorities in the individual occupied areas of Korea are currently using the Chinese Communist army as the core to recruit Korean young men aged 17 to 25, attempting to form a large Korean army. It is estimated that there are about 500,000 eligible young men in the Soviet-occupied area. The weapons previously seized from the Japanese army are about to be used to equip the army. However, there is no reason for Korea to recruit any army. Regarding the negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities, the future seems to hold little hope. The Soviet Union has an iron curtain in the occupied area, making it difficult for us to learn the inside story. This is what Hodge said to reporters after discussing the situation in Korea with President Truman today. According to Army Secretary Patterson, Hodge was summoned back to the country to assist the Army Department and the State Department in drafting a report on the situation in Korea, so that Secretary of State Marshall would have a basis when he went to Moscow to hold a four-nation foreign ministers meeting to discuss Korea. According to State Department officials, Hodge's report on the local situation did not change the US policy toward Korea in the slightest. The two policies that the United States is now pursuing are: (1) consolidating the economic development of South Korea; (2) establishing agreed legislation, which is the best way to promote Korean politics. It is also learned that the meeting between Hodge and Marshall was very brief and did not discuss the Korean issue to be discussed in Moscow. Hodge spent most of his time in the Army Department, discussing the issue of managing Korea with relevant officials.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Rhee Syngman, chairman of the Korean Committee who recently returned here from Korea, today demanded that the United States arm the people of South Korea and allow them to conduct military training. Rhee also said: When the Soviet Union is training a large Korean army in North Korea, how can the people of South Korea be deprived of the right to implement arms and conduct military training! Rhee continued: "If people are not allowed to organize their own government, we will see a Korea that believes in democracy being ravaged by the Communist Party."</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 25th] Rhee Syngman, the leader of the South Korea Alliance, and Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, both accused the Soviet Red Army of recruiting Koreans in Washington. The Soviet Labor Organ newspaper, Trud, said in an editorial today, although not directly responding to the words of the two, it pointed out that Rhee Syngman intends to obtain weapons from the United States to start "military operations" against the Communist Party in North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea's Independent Government Established on March 1</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, recently announced that South Korea will establish an independent government on March 1. He now intends to ask the Congressional Budget Committee tomorrow to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the work of occupying Korea. He continued: People in North Korea often attempt to cross the US-Soviet demarcation line and are mostly arrested by the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 25th] Ye Loo, an observer from Korea attending the United Nations General Assembly, announced today that he has asked US Secretary of State Marshall to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow. According to the report of General Hodge, Commander of the Southern Korea Army, the Soviet Union has admitted to conscripting Koreans in the Soviet-occupied area of Korea, and Hodge's words are completely true. If the United States and the Soviet Union cannot negotiate a solution in Moscow, the Korean issue should be submitted to the United Nations. If the current situation in Korea does not improve, there is a possibility of civil war. Ye Loo assured Marshall that Korea only wants peace and also made this guarantee to the Soviet Union. Korea has no military intentions toward the Soviet Union but does not want to be a puppet of the United States or the Soviet Union or any country. South Korea is currently occupied by the US military. Ye Loo said that Marshall has formulated a practical plan for the military government. It is said that if the negotiations on unifying Korea have become hopeless, as Hodge said, then 30 million Koreans will die of starvation, but the negotiations are not actually hopeless.</p>
<h3>US Interior Secretary Meets MacArthur Yesterday to Discuss Administrative Issues on Pacific Islands, Acheson Visits Marshall Again Before Returning to Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] US Interior Secretary Krug met with MacArthur here on the 25th to discuss the issue of the governor of Guam and other Pacific islands for about two hours. In the afternoon, Krug and his team went to the war crimes trial to listen. At the same time, Lieutenant General Ergenbrock is scheduled to host a banquet for Krug tonight. Krug will fly to Wake Island and Hawaii within days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] US Congressman Poulson and others accompanied Secretary of the Interior Krug to inspect here. MacArthur declared to them today that the peace treaty with Japan should be signed as soon as possible. The democratization of Japan is more promising than that of Germany. The delay in concluding the peace treaty with Japan is enough to hinder Japan's recovery of normal trade, resulting in excessive reliance on the United States. The future of Japan is actually the most advanced cemetery for American democracy and Christianity. Once the peace treaty is established, normal trade will develop accordingly, and American taxpayers can greatly reduce the burden. Japan now has the ability to govern itself, and there is no harm in concluding the peace treaty immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] MacArthur's political advisor Aitcheson is scheduled to fly back to Tokyo on the 25th to resume his position as chairman of the Four-Power Control Committee for Japan. Aitcheson met with Secretary of State Marshall this afternoon but declined to comment on the content of the talks.</p>
<h3>Allied Industries in Japan Are Not Used for Compensation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] The Allied Headquarters has instructed the Japanese government that 100% of the machinery and property enjoyed by the people of the Allied countries in Japan before December 7, 1941, will be retained and not used for compensation claims. If the property belongs to the Ford Matsuda Company and the Tonggong Mada Company, it will be incorporated into the Japanese Army Arsenal after being recorded in Japan. It is 100% the property of the Allied countries, and the property will be removed from the compensation form.</p>
<h3>US Republican Congressman Attaches Importance to Arctic Defense</h3>
<p>Advocates Annexing Greenland and Iceland</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Republican Congressman Hilhar today submitted a bill to Congress requesting the annexation of Greenland and Iceland on the Arctic frontier. The bill proposes authorizing the President of the United States to invite Iceland to become a state of the United States and to negotiate the purchase of Greenland. Keith said, "The time has come. The Soviet Union is expanding in all directions, and Britain and France are seizing their empires, unwilling to let go. In this situation, for defense purposes, the United States should obtain Greenland and Iceland before the last spark of gratitude from past allies is extinguished."</p>
<h3>US Pacific Fleet to Conduct Large-Scale Exercises</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, 25th] The US super battleship "Iowa" led 22 warships out today for "Pacific Exercise War." The flag of Vice Admiral Montgomery, Commander of the First Mobile Fleet, was raised high on the "Iowa." Rear Admiral Harrison, on the aircraft carrier "Boxer," will lead the team to engage in exercise war with the West Pacific Fleet commanded by Rear Admiral MacMatin, and then meet to "attack" Hawaii.</p>
<h3>Report on the Reorganization of Germany Nears Completion</h3>
<p>Will be Submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers for Discussion</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Berlin, 25th] The report on the reorganization of Germany prepared by the Allied Coordination Committee is 1,500 pages long, divided into nine parts and thirty-two desires, including the elimination of Nazism, disarmament, implementation of democracy, extradition of people, revision of territory, and dissolution of Prussia. It is currently being studied by the Four-Power Control Conference on Germany. If it is considered appropriate, it will be sent to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. Although the content has not been announced, it is said by well-informed sources that opinions are extremely divergent, but agreement has been reached on several important points, such as the dissolution of Prussia. According to reliable American sources, American and Soviet opinions were extremely inconsistent when drafting this report, which caused fierce debates at the time. Finally, the British representative Robertson mediated to avoid quarrels.</p>
<h3>As the Four Foreign Ministers Conference Approaches, the Soviet Union Spends Money to Repair the Venue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet Union is now spending millions of rubles to renovate the Moscow Hotel to prepare for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held on March 10. The walls of each room in the hotel are newly wallpapered, and new furniture is being transported in one after another. Repairs are also being carried out throughout the city. The venue for the foreign ministers meeting has not yet been officially announced, but it is generally not in the Spiridonovka Palace, but in the Hall of Columns. The former is the venue for the previous two foreign ministers meetings, and the Hall of Columns used to be a noble club.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Minister Bevin and his entourage of more than 100 people plan to leave London on March 4 for Moscow. He will take a special train from Calais, France, via Brussels, Berlin, and Warsaw, and is expected to arrive in Moscow on March 9. The Foreign Ministers Conference will open the next day.</p>
<h3>End of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Discussing the Drafting of the Report</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 24th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the draft peace treaty with Germany this afternoon for five hours and has in fact ended. The issue of reporting and consulting with Allied countries other than the four powers has once again become an obstacle to the Foreign Ministers Conference. A special committee has prepared a report, but Soviet representative Gusev declared that he would rather submit this issue to the Moscow Conference for discussion. Therefore, American representative Hefti proposed a report drafted by the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France, and another report drafted by the Soviet representative. After a long discussion, it was decided that each country's representative could submit their suggestions and opinions. In addition, the draft peace treaty with Austria has in fact completed all preparations, and only several economic clauses remain to be discussed.</p>
<p>The British Navy Clears Mines in the Corfu Strait (British Information Office)</p>
<h3>Corfu Incident: The United States Plans to Support Britain, the Soviet Union Defends Albania</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 24th] Regarding the illegal laying of mines by Britain and Albania in the Corfu Strait, the US representative today plans to support Britain's accusations, but the Soviet representative supports Albania's defense, arguing that the Security Council should stop discussing this case. At today's Security Council meeting, US representative Chamberlin said that the evidence presented by Britain "seems credible." Johnson then expressed his support for Australia's suggestion that a small committee study the various evidence in this case. Soviet representative Gromyko heard this and showed opposition to Australia's suggestion, supporting Albania's position and condemning Britain for destroying other countries' territorial waters. According to Britain's accusations, the case is based on the explosion of two mines in the Corfu Strait in October of last year. At that time, two British ships were destroyed, and 44 British naval officers were killed. However, the Albanian representative now denies that the country laid mines to destroy British ships.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Discussion Topics Should Be Separate from Disarmament Commission - Ambassador Koo's Speech at Rollins College</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Winter Park, Florida, 24th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, V.K. Wellington Koo, received an honorary doctorate from Rollins College today and stated in his speech at the college's "Mid-Winter Convocation" that the discussion topics of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should be separated from those of the Disarmament Commission. Safeguarding the authority of the commission to handle the issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy is extremely important for peace and for the ultimate success of general disarmament efforts, so that it can handle the effective system of supervising and controlling destructive weapons as a closely linked part of an overall whole. The establishment of an international police force, disarmament, and the abolition of atomic weapons are all interconnected issues, and although they are handled by three different organizations, the final consideration will rest with the Security Council. Unless an agreement can be reached on the implementation steps of the resolutions, the hope of establishing a collective security system to ensure world peace will be shattered, and world peace will remain elusive.</p>
<h3>Control of Atomic Energy – US-Soviet Disagreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th: The Security Council is scheduled to complete the current stage of atomic management discussions within this week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th Radio: Some members of the US House of Representatives oppose the United States selling equipment for the manufacture of group destruction weapons to the Soviet Union until the United States has obtained evidence indicating that the Soviet Union has signed an agreement on international inspection of atomic energy.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] This morning, some US officials criticized the recent Soviet proposals regarding atomic energy as "unacceptable" and stated that they should be returned to the Atomic Energy Commission for further discussion. US Chief Representative Austin will also present the same views in the Security Council, which will decide on the steps for an international atomic energy control system. This is the first time the US delegation has attacked the Soviet proposals on atomic energy. Whether Austin will elaborate on the US position at the afternoon meeting will depend on how the meeting handles the differing opinions. Gromyko hopes that the Security Council's discussion of the Atomic Energy Commission's report will be limited to the American proposals agreed to by the Soviet Union. The other member states hope to discuss the entire report. The atomic issue is one of the Security Council's important tasks this week. Other major issues include the dispute between Britain and Albania over the Corfu Channel and the US request to unilaterally administer the former Japanese mandated islands.</p>
<h3>US Decides to Assist Jews in Migrating to Palestine</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] President Truman stated today that the US government advocates allowing 100,000 Jews to migrate to and reside within Palestine, and he will make every effort to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Strongly Advocates Strengthening Defense - Truman to Ask Congress to Extend the Selective Service Act</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, St. Louis, Missouri, 24th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower stated at a civilian reception here today that the United States should not neglect defense because it possesses the atomic bomb. In his indirect appeal against reducing military spending, Eisenhower did not directly mention the atomic bomb, but stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes adequate defense. Our military thinkers have conquered the world by controlling the potential of the universe, but I will condemn those who carelessly place their security in a weapon that can kill millions overnight. Those who measure security solely by offensive capability distort the meaning of security and mislead people.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th Radio: Eisenhower warned the American people today that atomic bombs alone cannot guarantee security, and the United States should not abandon other defensive weapons because it possesses atomic bombs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced to the press today that President Truman will submit a proposal to Congress in April requesting an extension of the Selective Service Act.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Debates Indian Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 25th Radio: The British House of Lords debated the issue of Indian independence today. It is said that the British opposition party does not oppose India's separation from Britain, but three points must be achieved: (1) The separation process must be orderly; (2) India must sign a treaty with Britain; (3) India must fulfill certain obligations. British Prime Minister Attlee stated that if India wishes to remain under British rule, it is welcome. If India wants to secede, Britain is willing to negotiate with it.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten Slightly Injured in Car Accident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 25th Radio: The car carrying the new Viceroy of India, Mountbatten, overturned, and he suffered minor injuries.</p>
<h3>Japanese Train Derailment Causes Unprecedented Tragedy</h3>
<p>178 People Killed</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Kumazawa, 25th] A train derailed here today, killing at least 178 people and injuring 350, marking the worst tragedy in the history of Japanese National Railways. The train had a total of six carriages, four of which were completely destroyed. Each carriage was packed with no less than 200 passengers. The carriages were shattered, blood was splattered everywhere, and the bodies of men and women were strewn across the nearby wheat fields, creating a horrific scene. According to railway inspectors, 178 people died, but the exact number may not be clear until after the wreckage is cleared.</p>
<h3>Far East Tribunal Continues Trial - US Lawyer Makes Strange Argument</h3>
<p>Claiming Japan Never Prepared for War</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th] At the Far East International Tribunal, American defense lawyer Logan today defended the defendant after Kiyose. He opposed the prosecutor's accusation that "from before and after the Northeast Incident, Japan's politics, economy, and education were all intentionally prepared for a war of aggression." He stated that not only was there no conspiracy among the defendants, but there was also opposition. Japan never made any economic preparations for war, nor did it ever engage in propaganda sufficient to incite war and crime.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Nazis Arrested</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, 24th] It was announced here that British military police have captured nearly 1,000 German conspirators in the British occupation zone, equivalent to 80% of all conspirators.</p>
<h3>Communism in South America</h3>
<p>—Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>…Communism is already at the back door of the Americas. If Uncle Sam does not act quickly to recover the lost defensive barrier…</p>
<p>Today, the Communist Party is not only the fastest-growing force in South America, but also a political force that exists universally in various South American countries. This is very important to Americans because, like what happens in the United States, it has a direct bearing on the American people.</p>
<p>The United States has always regarded South America as its restricted area, where no country outside the Western Hemisphere can compete with it for supremacy.</p>
<p>Past Situation</p>
<p>In the past, all threats that could endanger American interests in Latin America mostly came from outside the boundaries of the continent; for example, Japanese fishing fleets operating on the sea near the west coast of South America, the possibility of German submarines establishing fuel supply stations on the east coast, and the danger of the intrusion of German aerial power that had already established an aviation network in South America.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>But today, the threat comes from within—the intrusion of Soviet power into South America, on the one hand, comes through the front door, and on the other hand, it sneaks in secretly.</p>
<p>The so-called entering through the front door refers to the diplomatic relations that the Soviet Union established in various South American countries after its victory in the war. For example, the organization of the Soviet embassies stationed in Venezuela and Colombia is larger than the organization of the American embassies stationed in the same countries, which is an illustration.</p>
<p>The so-called sneaking in secretly refers to the Communist parties in various South American countries. These Communist parties have obtained legal status in most countries, and although it has only been a few months, they have spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>Political Economy</p>
<p>The Communist Party simultaneously possesses both political and economic power in South America. In the political aspect, the Communist Party has already used its full strength to elect the current government of Chile, and at the same time, it has established the position of opposition party and future successor in several other countries. In the economic aspect, the Communist Party has already gained a dominant position in the major labor unions in South America. For example, the Panama Canal is the central point of the American two-ocean defense system. When the American navy needs it strategically, it can transfer from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through it. But the Communist Party now controls the most important labor union in the Canal Zone, which has 18,000 workers. In the event of war between the US and the Soviet Union, unless the United States sends troops to protect the Canal and occupy the nearby areas, how much the United States can utilize the Canal is indeed a question.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of Chile has already controlled the largest labor union in the country. Chile is a country that produces nitrate, and nitrate is indispensable to the American war chemical industry. The leader of the Chilean Communist Party recently issued a statement saying: "In the event that the United States goes to war with the Soviet Union, Chile will stop shipping anything to the United States."</p>
<p>Brazilian Communist Party</p>
<p>The unions under the leadership of the Communist Party in Brazil recently demonstrated their power by using a general strike to seal off the port of Santos, the world's largest coffee export market. Later, three more unions launched strikes involving trams, telephones, gas, and electricity, almost paralyzing the entire capital of Brazil.</p>
<p>Americans often think that the Communist Party is a rabble, but when the Brazilian government allowed the Communist Party to participate in the election last year, it made a stunning appearance, winning more than 600,000 votes, meaning that one out of every ten voters in the country voted for the Communist Party. In Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, the Communist Party received 116,000 votes, which is not much different from the 147,000 votes won by the victorious General Dutra.</p>
<p>The Communist Party is not only gaining power in voting. When the Communist Party and the Brazilian government clashed over domestic politics, they could control the most powerful unions in the country and launch nationwide strikes. Although the government can use guns and cannons to suppress the strikes, the result only deepens the rift between the upper and lower classes.</p>
<p>Chilean Communist Party</p>
<p>The Communist Party won the election in Chile with a superior number of votes. President Videla immediately adopted a portion of the Communist Party's plans and included three Communist Party members in the cabinet, serving as the Minister of Transportation and Public Works, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Minister of Colonization.</p>
<p>South American Public</p>
<p>The people who support the Communist Party in South America have no goodwill towards Western democracy. They regard Americans as imperialists and do not treat them as friends. The reason is very simple. For example, in Venezuela, the average worker's daily wage is only thirty cents, but it costs twelve cents to buy an egg, ten cents to buy a pound of corn, thirty cents to buy a loaf of bread, and thirty-five cents to buy a quart of milk. These workers mostly work on land owned by Americans, and therefore resent Americans.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the South American public has a low level of education, and American ideas are not easily instilled into their minds. In countries such as Bolivia, 80% of the people are illiterate, so it is impossible to influence them with writing. But illiteracy does not hinder the Communist Party. Their spokespersons are all indigenous leaders who speak directly to the people. At the same time, illiteracy is not an obstacle to voting. Voters in Venezuela used colored cards to vote: white represented the Democratic Action Party, and red represented the Communist Party.</p>
<p>For intellectuals, the Communist Party has established a news network in South America, sending more than 10,000 words of news and propaganda telegrams from Moscow every day.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has indeed become overwhelmingly dominant in South America. An American writer sighed: "Our honeymoon with Latin America is over!"</p>
<p>American Countermeasures</p>
<p>What can the United States do now to prevent the complete secession of South America? The most essential step is to find a way to bridge the gap between the upper and lower classes in South America: take economic actions to create a stable middle class. The method is to increase the purchasing power of the common people, so that a portion of the people can jump from the laboring masses to become small businessmen, small shopkeepers, small factory owners, and self-reliant farmers.</p>
<p>Industrialization cannot solve the entire South American problem. If industry is just a large-scale enterprise that employs a large number of workers and pays them meager wages, then communism will absorb many new believers. But if it can help Latin America establish its inherent small businesses, then it can establish an economic foundation for democracy. That is to say: in helping South America industrialize, one should not only focus on large enterprises, but also provide loans to small industries. In addition, technical training should be implemented for South Americans to cultivate management talents and instill in them industrial and commercial skills. At the same time, the middle class relies on a well-off salaried class to survive. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the treatment of ordinary workers at the same time. Only in this way can the confidence of South Americans in the United States be restored.</p>
<p>Improve Life</p>
<p>Therefore, if the goal is to maintain American interests in South America, it can be achieved not by force but by friendship. But the so-called friendship is not enough to rely solely on propaganda. It must be manifested with facts that improve the lives of the people in order to be effective.</p>
<p>"The New York Times" once published a dispatch sent by Whitt from the Brazilian capital, stating: "According to recent facts, the Soviet Union is launching a hegemonic offensive against the world, the intensity of which is no less than the most active era of the former Third International."</p>
<p>Communism has arrived at the back door of the Americas, and the United States is on the verge of losing the defensive barrier of South America.</p>
<h3>Director of Qinghai Provincial Government's Shanghai Office Embezzles Public Funds to Speculate in Gold - The Fourth Supervisory Committee Investigates and Reports, Chairman Approves Strict Punishment - Ministry of National Defense Sends Personnel to Assist in Investigating Military Personnel's Gold Speculation with Military Pay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Regarding the figure mentioned in yesterday's newspaper about incumbent officials using public funds to purchase gold during the gold rush period, the reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that it was the Director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's Shanghai Office. This person has now left Shanghai and may have returned to Qinghai. The total amount of public funds embezzled was 1 billion National Currency, of which 350 million has been confirmed to have been used to purchase gold, and the use of the remaining 650 million is unclear. If calculated based on 350 million, the gold purchased is still less than 100 bars, which is still considered a "fly" in the entire financial turmoil. However, because he is a civil servant who used public funds to seek illegal profits, which violates the law, the supervisory committee investigated and reported to Chairman Chiang this time, who approved "strict punishment according to the law." It is now learned that the four supervisory committee members have completed their work and returned to Nanjing yesterday. The case has been drafted and will be submitted for impeachment in the coming days. Once the impeachment is established, it will be transferred to the judicial authorities for severe punishment.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is rumored that some military personnel used military pay to speculate in gold during this gold and currency rush. It is learned that the Economic Supervision Group found that a certain unit's office overdrawn 3 billion yuan from the National Treasury. Whether this large sum was used for gold trading is still unknown. The Economic Supervision Group is still thoroughly investigating. Yesterday, the Ministry of National Defense specially dispatched Zhong Ying, an army quartermaster supervisor from the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yi Wei, a major general senior staff officer from the Ministry of National Defense, to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. They have established close ties with the Economic Supervision Group.</p>
<p>Import/Export Firm Speculates in Gold</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Economic Supervision Group has been investigating the accounts of various firms and banks for days. Yesterday, they discovered an import/export firm, Tai Shen Zhan, operating gold and US dollar mortgage loans, similar to an underground bank. Group members Gan Qingshan and Ha Yinpu found that the firm was operating with approximately 80 gold bars and had torn out several pages of its account books recording gold and currency transactions in an attempt to destroy evidence. The Economic Supervision Group summoned its manager, Chen Keda, a Guangdong native, and ordered him to post bail. He will be handed over to the court for punishment according to the law.</p>
<p>Inside Story Difficult to Ascertain - Tiger Difficult to Catch</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] After ten days of investigation by the Economic Supervision Group, the inside story of the gold rush has not yet yielded any surprising discoveries. Although the person in charge has repeatedly expressed the determination to "catch tigers" and stated that they have obtained clues as to who was manipulating the gold rush, and are only awaiting the Chairman's approval before making it public, according to the reporter's compilation of information from various sources, the rumored so-called blacklist has not yet been confirmed to have been submitted to the Chairman. It is not easy to identify the real "big tigers." Even if rumors spread widely, these behind-the-scenes figures did not personally engage in speculative manipulation and creating disturbances, so there is a lack of evidence to bring them to justice.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The second group affairs meeting of the Economic Supervision Group will be held at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss expanding the organization. It is learned that the focus will be on supervising the stabilization of prices, and it may become a permanent institution.</p>

<h3>Wu Kaixian Summoned to Nanjing to Discuss Wage Index Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the government announced the Economic Emergency Measures Program, freezing the workers' cost-of-living index, workers in various places have expressed opposition. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs returned to Nanjing the night before last and will also study this issue. Now that the end of the month is approaching, how the workers' wages for this month should be paid is an urgent issue to be resolved.

Wu departed for Nanjing on the night train last night and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

<h3>Three Price Control Agencies Discuss Unified Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The agencies in this city that enforce price controls are the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau.

In order to unify the enforcement of controls, a meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room yesterday afternoon to discuss measures. Wu Kaixian, Gu Bingyuan, Ji Mingzhai, and Zhou Weixin from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Yamin from the Garrison Command, and Xu Youzuo from the Police Bureau attended. Director Wu suggested that contact should be established in the future, and if there is a summons, the other parties should be notified.

<h3>Gongyi Rice Store Hoarding Case - Three Employees Handed Over to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at International Hotel - Waiters' Salaries Reduced - Implementation Temporarily Postponed After Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A labor-management dispute occurred at the International Hotel yesterday. The employees of the hotel are paid in two ways. The waiters who come into contact with customers are paid half of the salary of other employees because they can get tips from customers. Later, the management department considered this method inappropriate. Since December of last year, the salaries of all employees have been uniformly regulated, and a 10% tip is added to the room bill, which is divided equally among all employees. Waiters are not allowed to ask residents for tips, and if found, they will be dismissed. This method was originally intended to be tried for three months, expiring at the end of this month. During this period, it was found that waiters were still asking residents for tips, so the hotel manager Lin Mianzhi plans to restore the method before March 1, reducing the salary of the room department waiters by 40% and the salary of the 14th floor waiters by 50% to reduce income and subsidize other employees in the engineering department and kitchen. The 120 waiters in the room department and on the 14th floor heard the news and believed that since tips are not allowed and salaries are reduced by half, a dispute arose, and slogans were posted yesterday. The Board of Directors appointed Qian Xinzhi, Shi Boqun, and Sun Liji as three representatives to convene the employee representatives for a conversation, and agreed to temporarily postpone the implementation of the method.</p>
<h3>Subsidy Issue Before Start of Rationing System - Municipal Authorities Discuss Effective Measures - Price Difference to be Monetized and Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the central government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures Program, it has been generally recognized that although the gold rush has subsided, if there is no proper and effective way to suppress price fluctuations, freezing the cost-of-living index will inevitably cause unrest among salaried people. The reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday. Wu said that the recent surge in prices in this city was indeed affected by the gold rush. Since I took office more than a year ago, the price increase has not exceeded more than one-fold, but after the gold price jumped sharply, prices rose in a straight line. Now that the central government has restricted gold trading, I believe prices can be stabilized. For rice, I am even more confident. The government has a sufficient amount of rice reserves, which will definitely be able to control rice prices. The mayor also said that recently several rice merchant representatives visited to request the city government to allocate rice. Although the city government has abundant rice reserves, and 17,000 tan arrived yesterday, their request was not granted because the amount of rice needed in this city is 10,000 shih per day. If more rice is allocated, it may cause hoarding and manipulation.</p>
<p>Regarding how to subsidize the lives of employees before the rationing of goods begins after the cost-of-living index is frozen, Mayor Wu said that he has discussed effective measures with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, which is to monetize the difference between the market price of the planned rations for this month and the market price of last month, and issue it to employees in cash. Mayor Wu also believes that this measure is extremely fair and can be implemented after approval by the central government. President Ning called Mayor Wu long distance yesterday for this purpose. According to Wu, this method is expected to be implemented from the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>When asked about the fact that the in-kind rationing method formulated by the central government is limited to public education personnel, and other cultural circles and the huge working class cannot be popularized, and that people in the press are also equally unable to benefit from it, which will make the freezing of the cost-of-living index the biggest threat to them, Mayor Wu replied that he would suggest that the capital implement the aforementioned differential subsidy method. He also said: I will discuss it with the persons in charge of various newspapers soon, so the press can allay their fears.</p>
<h3>Great China Spring Festival Wages: Labor Demands Still to be Paid</h3>

<h3>Wusong Gas Plant Supplies Hongkou District</h3>

However, the Wusong Gas Plant, which is managed by the Public Utilities Bureau, has a good supply situation. After research, the gas main was connected.

<p>Compensation for losses of 18 million</p>

Except for Hai Qi's part being rejected, Jin and Zhang were also judged by the Land Court in December last year, believing that there was insufficient evidence of guilt, so they were declared innocent. However, the Wang family's excavated ancestral graves and lost parts have been repeatedly mediated by the Land Court's President Lian Zong, Jackson, etc., for several months. Finally, on the 24th of this month, the Director of the Executive Yuan, Sai Shu, allocated 18 million for Wang Detang and others to receive, and the settlement was concluded.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Annual Revenue Budget Increased by Over 51.7 Billion Municipal Senators' Meeting Resolution on Budget Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Budget Committee of the Municipal Senate held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Senate to continue discussing and finalizing the city government's fiscal year 36 budget revenue.

As a result of the review, in addition to the previously determined 23.1 billion yuan increase in the financial sector, a total of 28.66 billion yuan in revenue was added to the budgets of various bureaus, totaling over 51.7 billion yuan with the previous increase. The increases in various departments are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Utilities Department: The increase is relatively large. Except for a few minor items, the total increase is 21.554 billion yuan, including: a 50% increase in public utilities fines, totaling 13.6 million yuan; a 50% increase in the franchise fee for private ferry services, totaling 49.38 million yuan; a 25% increase in advertising registration fees, totaling 71.66 million yuan; an additional 7.8485 billion yuan in compensation fees for various electric power companies; an additional 510 million yuan in compensation fees for the French Tram Company; an additional 1.507 billion yuan in compensation fees for the British Tram Company; and an additional 11.55 billion yuan in public utilities surcharges.</p>

<p>Police Department: A total increase of 327 million yuan, including a 300 million yuan increase in administrative fines and a 50% increase in administrative fees, amounting to 15 million yuan, and a doubling of fire department revenue, adding 12 million yuan.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Office: No increase was granted temporarily because although 8,000 more national identity cards were added for citizens aged 14 this year, the fee issue still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau: The budget revenue, such as industrial and commercial registration, metrology inspection fees, business license fees, and agricultural income, totals nearly 200 million yuan. However, this budget is already higher than the actual amount that can be received, and the agricultural aspect is still in the development stage, so there is no way to increase it.</p>
<p>Education Department: Apart from business, there is no income, so there is no increase. The collection of health and health education revenue will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Public Works Department: A total increase of 284.4 million yuan. It was decided to double the registration license fees for construction factories (including construction costs), from the original budget of 38.4 billion to 76.8 million. The highway maintenance fee of 120 million will be doubled, adding 120 million. The park admission ticket will be increased by 50% from the original 162 million to 81 million. The park stadium rental fee will be doubled, adding 3.6 million. Because the number of bicycles has greatly increased, the park bicycle parking fee can also be doubled to 3 million.</p>

<h3>One Spiritually Depressed One Eloquent and Persuasive Two Monks of Jing'an Temple Desmijia Retrial Request for Bail Instructions to Await Collegiate Court Decision</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Mijia of Jing'an Temple were retried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being traitors. Dewu's bald head was covered with black hair, and he was wearing a black monk's robe, looking quite depressed. Mijia wore glasses and a gray monk's robe, speaking eloquently and persuasively. Many monks came to listen, their bald heads and robes presenting a unique sight.</p>
<p>Dewu confessed: "I have been the abbot of Jing'an Temple for 30 years, and I invited Mijia to serve as supervisor. The Pseudo-Shanghai Buddhist Association is a religious organization composed of various temples in Shanghai. Mijia was elected as the standing director of the association. The Dobun Japanese Language School was run by the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple, which forcibly occupied two school buildings of Jing'an Temple Elementary School. I have never been the chairman of the board of the school. The principal was Monk Zhifeng, and his whereabouts are now unknown. The pseudo-report stated that I was the chairman of the board of the school and attended the opening ceremony, which is not true. The Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly was initiated by Rongzeng Kanbu, a Tibetan Lama, and held at the address of Jing'an Temple."</p>
<p>Mijia confessed: "The Buddhist Association is a trade association. I was elected as a standing director and had to participate. I had no relationship with the Japanese. The Japanese monk Yumoto came to China, and the Buddhist Association sent me to welcome him. There were no symposiums held. The Greater East Asia Memorial Service was initiated by the Japanese. Because Chu Minyi was a Buddhist, he was listed as one of the initiators. I have never served as the principal of Dobun Japanese Language School. The news reported at the time was not true."</p>
<p>Finally, the defense lawyer presented many pieces of evidence favorable to the defendant and requested bail. The court ordered a written application to be submitted for a decision by the collegiate court. The case was adjourned for retrial, and the two monks were still detained in the Zhongjian Prison.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yang Ruijun, the righteous brother of Liang Renda, went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to meet with Mayor Wu at his request. The reason why the mayor repeatedly urged him was purely to warn him not to expand the funeral, so that gangsters could take advantage of the opportunity to act. However, the family insisted on holding a large funeral. Yang said yesterday, "People always have to hold a funeral when they die. If the Municipal Government is afraid of disrupting public order, it can send police along the way to protect it." The mayor said, "We can protect it if there are few people. If you expect only a few hundred relatives to participate, but thousands of people come, how can we protect it? I already know that many schools have printed slogans and leaflets, so standing in the position of the government, I have to come out and warn you!" Finally, Mayor Wu suggested: "The date of Liang Renda's funeral can be decided as soon as possible. At that time, in addition to family members, the number of people participating in the funeral from various organizations will be restricted, and the use of any slogans and leaflets will be absolutely prohibited."

<h3>List of Places Without Burial Space Both Burial and Cremation Have Problems</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] It is reported that the mortality rate in the city, according to the statistics of the Health Bureau last year, averaged three deaths per thousand people per month. If the city is calculated with a population of 4 million, then an average of 12,000 people die each month. At present, there are more than 100,000 coffins accumulated in the city, and most of the general cemeteries are full, with only a few vacant spaces in the Hongqiao Cemetery and others. In order to solve this problem, in addition to actively clearing accumulated coffins, the Health Bureau has requested the city government to allocate 500 acres of public land for burial purposes. It is estimated that each acre can bury 100 people, so 500 acres can be used to bury 50,000 people. However, if calculated according to the above mortality rate, the 500 acres of public land will be insufficient in the short term. Although the general public intends to solve the problem with cremation, given the current facilities of the Jing'an Temple Cemetery in the city, only three cremations can be performed per day, so even if more than 100,000 accumulated coffins are cleared, it will take a long time to complete.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Island Mystery: The Truth Comes to Light; Li Yunpeng and Others Accused of Embezzlement and Public Prosecution for Stealing and Selling Supplies; Allegations of Gold Hidden in Bathtub Proven False; Wang Qianli and Others' False Accusation Crimes Meet Amnesty Conditions, No Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Fuxing Island mystery, after four months of investigation by the District Procuratorate, has finally been revealed. Before the victory, the island was occupied by the Japanese as a naval base. When the enemy surrendered, they left behind a large amount of supplies. The first batch of reception personnel who entered the island were indeed suspected of colluding to steal and sell supplies. However, the allegation of hiding gold in a bathtub was merely a rumor that spread due to personal conflicts and malicious accusations, making the case increasingly mysterious and complicated. The defendants, Wang Qianli, a specialist from the Agricultural Committee of the Executive Yuan, Zheng Ziping, the chief foreman of the Fisheries Administration Office, Zheng Guodong, Wang Jindong, Zheng Weixin, Chen Jiahui, and others, were suspected of false accusation, but their crimes occurred before December 31, 1946, meeting the amnesty conditions under item A of the amnesty decree, therefore, they were not prosecuted. According to the non-prosecution document written by the investigating prosecutor Gu Hongbiao: After the victory, the navy was stationed on Fuxing Island, and Wang Qianli was the initial person in charge of the office established on the island by the Executive Yuan. Wang then boasted of his</p>
<p>Difficult Negotiations, intending to seize the position of Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of the institution. Later, because the Agricultural Committee was subordinate to the Fisheries Administration Office, Wang harbored resentment and indignation. Furthermore, Li Yunpeng, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Fisheries Administration Office, was introduced by him, and Wang Songqian and Jin Zhensheng, were his relatives and followers, respectively. Wang believed that his confidants were everywhere, and he could use the workers to expand his own power and secretly plot to undermine others, which was not a new occurrence. Later, two white porcelain bathtubs were found buried in air-raid shelters on the island, and rumors spread that they were</p>
<p>Full of Gold Bars. The worker who discovered them, Wang Kui, was originally a henchman of Li Yunpeng. Because Li wanted to steal supplies, he secretly colluded with Niu Chunling, a platoon leader of the navy, and conspired with Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui to transport supplies out. The news inevitably spread. Wang Qianli, considering that Li was introduced by him and should be at his disposal, hinted that Li should resign from his position as head of the General Affairs Section, intending to sabotage his plan. Unexpectedly, Li, for the sake of his own interests, feared the loss of his position and turned against him. As a result, the two sides harbored deep hatred, and Wang instigated Zheng Ziping and others to issue</p>
<p>Anonymous Accusations, doing their best to attack Li Yunpeng and others. After identification, the anonymous letter under the pseudonym "Bai Zhicai" was written by the defendant Zheng Weixin. Although the anonymous letters under the pseudonyms "Yang Biting" and "Yang Bitang" could not be attributed to anyone based on handwriting analysis, clues were found indicating that someone was incited by Wang Qianli. Li Xiangyuan, the recommender of Wang Qianli, was a technical officer of the Executive Yuan and the director of the First Group of the Agricultural Committee. His nephew, Yang Xiyao, also known as Shunyao, had sought employment on the island but failed. Yang Xiyao and Wang Qianli were undoubtedly in cahoots. The meaning of "Yao Shun Yu Tang" and the usage of "Heng Bi Xi Mou" were clearly derived from</p>
<p>The Yao Dian in the Book of Documents, making it undoubtedly a false accusation by Yang Xiyao. However, regarding the part about colluding to steal and sell supplies, Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were the first to be stationed on Fuxing Island. At that time, the supplies left by the enemy on the island had not yet been sorted out. Li and others took the opportunity to collude with Niu Chunling, the platoon leader of the Third Platoon of the First Company of the Third Battalion of the Marine Corps, who was responsible for defense on the island, and gradually smuggled supplies to Taikoo Wharf and Nicheng Bridge on the Suzhou River for sale. On June 24th of last year, Li and others sold 295 old lead sheets, a motor, 20 boxes of metal locks and door hardware, and collapsed cart frame iron pipes to Ma Jiliang, Han Shunrong, and others, with Niu responsible for transportation.</p>
<p>The Plot Was Discovered and seized by the Garrison Headquarters. After interrogation, only Niu Chunling was sent to the naval military court for punishment. After Niu was detained, Li Yunpeng, fearing that he would reveal the truth, pretended to visit Niu once and gave Niu's family 30 taels of gold. Therefore, the defendants Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, and Jin Zhensheng are suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. Zhu Kui is suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law, the lower paragraph of Article 1, Section 1, and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Poverty and Corruption. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated.</p>

<h3>Reader's Inquiry: Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Itching and Ulceration of the Feet</p>
<p>Chen Qiren asks: My daughter is 14 years old and weak. Last winter, blisters suddenly appeared on the sole of her right foot, which quickly festered and spread to multiple areas, causing unbearable pain and itching. Western medicine injections of serum and 606 were ineffective. What is the disease? What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your daughter's feet may be suffering from what is commonly known as athlete's foot. You can wash them with a 1/1000 potassium permanganate solution.

(2) When sleeping or after exertion, the heartbeat is very fast. (3) When tired late at night, the brain seems to rumble, and memory declines. (4) Standing up after squatting often causes dizziness, blurred vision, and blackouts.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] This is neurasthenia, caused by excessive mental exertion or multiple stimuli. First of all, pay attention to mental cultivation, get enough sleep, and brain tonics and other calming medicines can only be used as auxiliary treatments.</p>

<h3>Self-Funded Students Went to Various Ministries and Departments Yesterday to Petition</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 25th] More than 80 self-funded students, including Du Du, who were admitted here, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 25th. First, Vice Minister Hang and Assistant Tong, Secretary Qu met with them. Later, when Minister Zhu arrived at the Ministry, they talked again. The main points were summarized and explained: (1) In order to cultivate talent, the Ministry of Education handled the self-funded study abroad examination and the self-funded study abroad regulations clearly stipulated that the expenses would be borne by themselves. (2) The Ministry of Education has the authority to examine, but the economy is beyond its authority. (3) It is well known that each student has economic difficulties, but the emergency foreign exchange measures are a government effort to save the economic crisis. Each student should be aware of the difficulties faced by the authorities. It is impossible for this Ministry to settle foreign exchange at 3350 [Report from our Nanjing, 25th] More than 80 self-funded students who were admitted in 1946 went to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Executive Yuan and other agencies to petition on the 25th. They successively met with Jiang Menglin, Zhu Jiahua, Li Tang, and others. It is heard that the relevant agencies will discuss the foreign exchange settlement methods for self-funded students. It is feared that the students' proposal to settle foreign exchange at 3350 cannot be done, but 12,000 is also unaffordable for them. The number to be decided in the future may be between the two. In addition, the students held a press conference at 5 pm.</p>
<h3>The Capital's Various Departments Hosted British Educator for the Blind Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 25th] Representatives from the Ministry of National Defense Education, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the two Administrations of Relief and Health held a meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs on the morning of the 25th to host Sir MacKercher, a British expert on the blind, and discuss the education of the blind. Mr. MacKercher put forward many opinions from three aspects: hygiene (such as paying attention to wiping hands), school education (such as civic training and the transmission of knowledge and skills), and occupations (such as many factory jobs that require the blind to work). He also said that the UK's education for the blind has been very effective. The US has failed to concentrate talent to handle it, and the results are inferior. According to my country, there are currently 30 schools for the blind nationwide, and Guangdong Province has 8 schools. Concentrated training of talents has achieved remarkable results, so relevant departments will concentrate into one institution to promote it. Mr. MacKercher visited Jing City's Education School on the 26th, flew to Chongqing on the 27th, and will come to Shanghai in mid-March, returning home at the end of March.</p>

<h3>Cao Yu Recounts What He Saw When Visiting the U.S. to Study Culture, Praising American Movies</h3>
<p>China's famous playwright Wan Jiabao (Cao Yu) recently visited the United States to study under the State Department's cultural exchange program and has now returned to China. He has praised both Broadway and Hollywood, saying that many hard-line scripts are currently being staged in American theaters, which has disproved the saying that Broadway and Hollywood are extremely commercialized. The general public's understanding of Broadway's music is also largely inaccurate. In Hollywood, Mr. Wan observed that American film writers and producers are very enterprising and have a long-term vision. Mr. Wan discussed the issue of Chinese writers at the Hollywood Film Writers Association and felt that they were happy to exchange opinions with him. At the request of the Film Writers Association, he wrote an article on the issue of Chinese writers for publication by the Association. During his ten months in the United States, Mr. Wan visited the drama and literature departments of various universities and lectured at various universities, including the University of Washington, the Catholic University of Washington, the University of Chicago, the University of California, the University of Colorado, and Yale University. He also visited the Chinese Research Institute at Yale University. In New York, he lectured at City Hall at the invitation of Ms. Pearl S. Buck and broadcast the situation of Chinese theater to Europe and his impressions of American theater to China through the State Department's International Broadcasting Department. He also attended the National Theater Conference in New York City. At the invitation of the University of Denver, Mr. Wan attended the National Humanitarian Conference at Estes Park, Colorado, and then attended the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and Atomic Energy Conference held there. The drama department of the University of Colorado performed one of Mr. Wan's plays, "Beijing People." Mr. Wan also attended the Pacific Northwest Writers Conference in Seattle, Washington. At the invitation of the Canadian government, he stayed in Canada for a month. Mr. Wan returned to China at the end of December last year and is now translating Eugene O'Neill's play "The Iceman Cometh."</p>
<h3>U.S. Elementary School Teachers Strike; Authorities Order Schools to Close</h3>
<p>[Report from Reuters, New York, 24th] Three-quarters of the 2,960 elementary school teachers in Buffalo City went on strike today. Authorities have ordered 78 of the city's 98 public schools to close, affecting more than 70,000 students. The reason for the teachers' strike is to demand that the annual salary of $2,400 per person be increased to $4,000.</p>
<h3>Elementary Education Federation Hosted Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Appealed for Rationing of Supplies</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Elementary School Teachers United Advancement Association hosted reporters at Xiangxue Garden yesterday afternoon and appealed for the right to ration supplies to private school teachers and for the dispute over the dismissal of teachers at Guanghan Elementary School. Chairman Ge Zhicheng said that the government provides daily necessities to public school teachers and staff but ignores private school teachers and staff, which is considered quite unreasonable. Last year, the government shouted the slogan that education does not distinguish between public and private. Public and private school teachers and staff have equal educational responsibilities, so this rationing of supplies should not be different. Some people say that private school teachers and staff have better salaries than public schools, but in general, there is not much difference. It cannot be generalized because of a few special cases. Private school teachers and staff should have the right to ration supplies, and there is a precedent to follow. Private schools can also apply for allocation and sale at the current Public School Staff Items Allocation Office of the City Government. In terms of the situation in this city during the enemy and puppet period, the puppet government also rationed supplies to private school teachers and staff. The government should pay more attention to this point. The Elementary Education Federation plans to unite with private secondary school teachers and staff, cultural figures, and private school teachers and staff in Nanjing to jointly fight for the right to ration supplies.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Revises Three Types of Forms to Simplify the Procedures for Registration of Overseas Chinese Schools to Strengthen the Connection Between Overseas Chinese Schools and the Motherland</h3>

<h3>Basketball League, Division Two: Chen You Team Wins Championship - All Black Forfeits to Encars Last Night</h3>
<p>Yesterday's three Division One basketball league games were still contested at the Municipal Gymnasium. The audience was small, and the situation was unremarkable. However, Qian Xucang, Chairman of the Basketball Committee, who had not been present for a long time, made a special visit yesterday to oversee everything.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Indian forfeited in Division Two, and Link Railway Shanghai lost to Chen You. Therefore, Chen You won the championship with five wins and five losses. The remaining game is irrelevant to the overall situation. The current standings are as follows:</p>

<h3>Recent Events at the Municipal Stadium</h3>
<p>The second year of the construction plan for the Nanshi Daji Road Branch of the Municipal Stadium is being accelerated. The office building will be completed in two weeks. There are also two mobile gold houses, which can be installed within a month. Over the past month or so, it has been heard that over 33 million has been secured for the above expenses, with over 20 million still short. The stadium director is trying every means to find a solution.</p>
<p>Spring is coming, and the track and field season is about to begin. After building the track, the stadium plans to purchase 70 sets of standard three-purpose new-style hurdles for use in various sports meets held in late April and May and June. The stadium is currently estimating the cost and raising funds separately. It is expected that the stadium's appearance will be significantly different before the Double Ten Festival (October 10th). The turfing of the field will be left to next spring.</p>
<p>Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Education, visited the Nanshi Stadium in person the other day and was deeply impressed by the stadium's spirit of "creating something from nothing, and multiplying one into two," actively reviving the stadium and striving to surpass the past. Deputy Director Li said that the most difficult thing is construction, and there is no problem in starting activities, but funds must be found.</p>
<p>The Mengxian Cup Small Football League is held in the stadium. The stadium is being borrowed and the following points are being followed: (1) No tickets will be sold. (2) The league is limited to four weeks. If it is not finished by then, it will have to borrow another stadium. (3) The schedule will be changed when the stadium itself has a match. (4) Efforts will be made to maintain discipline and prevent various bad habits on the football field, which would affect the stadium's future development.</p>
<p>As soon as the Football League is over, the Nanshi Stadium will cooperate with the Sports Association Football Committee to host the Industrial and Commercial Cup Invitational Football Tournament, and will invite enthusiastic sports people to jointly undertake some obligations, hoping to achieve mutual understanding and recognition in the work, and to seek thorough unity in the sports community.</p>
<p>The stadium's work this year has links with the Municipal Gymnasium. The stadium and gymnasium will cooperate to promote the project, and all plans have been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau's Social Education Department. Director Wang Ruchang and Section Chief Qiao Wenquan were very interested and strongly supported the project.</p>
<p>In addition to cooperating with the sports community in this city, the stadium is also working closely with the National Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, the All-China Sports Federation, and the Hong Kong Football Association to divide the work and cooperate to promote sports.</p>

<h3>Exports Sold on Consignment - Time Limit for Settling Foreign Exchange - Designated Banks Should be Responsible for Timely Settlement</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Business Bureau and the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank yesterday jointly issued three circulars to the designated banks, making some regulations on consignment sales of exports. The following is an excerpt and translation:</p>
<p>Circular No. 85 states that Circular No. 12 issued on March 14, 1946, is hereby rescinded and replaced by the following regulations: Regarding the measures for designated banks to purchase export or transit exchange bills and endorse proof under Chapter VII of the Interim Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade, it is hereby stipulated that if the export is a consignment sale (that is, goods not shipped with a letter of credit), it should be handled according to the following steps: (1) The words "consignment sale" should be noted in the amended CBC8a format table. (2) The foreign exchange must be settled within the following time limits: (A) For exports to Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines, the limit is 30 days. (B) For exports to India, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia, the limit is 60 days. (C) For exports to places other than those mentioned in (A) and (B), the limit is 90 days.</p>
<p>(3) When the amended CBC8a format is issued to the exporter, the exporter should guarantee to the designated bank that the relevant export exchange bill will be settled to the designated bank within the above-mentioned time limit. If this guarantee is not fulfilled, the exporter must further guarantee to sell the export at the highest price under his own name in the shortest possible time. (4) The designated bank should be responsible for settling the foreign exchange obtained from the consignment sales of exports referred to in this circular to the Central Bank in a timely manner. (5) Designated banks should be very cautious in handling the documents of consignment sales of exports. At the same time, they should pay attention to the fact that the goods listed in the invoices are accurately valued, and should pay attention to settling the foreign exchange to the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Circular No. 86 states that the following measures for the foreign exchange settlement of existing consignment sales of exports are based on the clauses that continue to be effective in Circular No. 12: (1) Unless otherwise stipulated by the Central Bank, all foreign exchange from goods exported before November 7, 1946, must be settled to the Central Bank at the official exchange rate in effect before February 6, 1947. In such cases, it is necessary to apply for a special permit from the US Affairs Bureau of the Central Bank before March 15, 1947. (2) If the exports were shipped between November 7 and November 16, 1946, and the foreign exchange has been settled between November 6 and November 15, 1947, they are entitled to enjoy the export subsidy. (3) For exports shipped between November 17 and February 6, the foreign exchange settled can be calculated according to the exchange rate in effect on the settlement date, but the foreign exchange must be settled within the time limit stipulated in Circular No. 85. Otherwise, it will be calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of foreign exchange settlement. Circular No. 87 instructed each designated bank: (1) Starting from February 24th, a report of purchased export foreign exchange (format CBC22b &amp; 24) should be prepared weekly, together with the invoices related to each export exchange bill, and submitted to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. (2) For consignment sales of exports, the relevant invoices and the guarantee letters submitted by the exporters must also be submitted to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Market Calm</h3>
<p>There was not much change in foreign stocks yesterday. Large stocks were still sluggish, while small stocks were still stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, British United Rayon Yarn fell by about half a percent, shipping and steel rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>Public debt transactions were still limited yesterday, and the market was stable. The opening price of Unified C was 6,600 yuan. Although 3600 yuan was sold for 6,300 yuan, 503 and 552 rooms took the opportunity to buy at low prices, rising back to 7,300 yuan and then turning around. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B each rose by 300 yuan, C and E recovered by 500 yuan, and Unified D rose by 400 yuan. The transaction volume was 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Small Four Banks - To Be Converted into Commercial Operations</h3>
<p>The original model for the four small banks in this city (i.e., China Commercial Bank, Siming Bank, China Industrial Bank, and National Goods Bank) was a joint government-business venture. The authorities have now decided to sell the government shares and convert them into commercial operations. It is said that the principle has already been decided, but the technical aspects are still under discussion. Because the original par value was quite low, and there is a huge difference from the current actual value, it is still being carefully reviewed how to calculate the price.</p>
<h3>White Sugar Opens Up 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was tight, and the spot white sugar, which was in short supply, was even stronger, rising by more than 10,000 yuan. The association's price for Peruvian fine sand was 230,000 yuan, and other prices also called for increases. For example, the price of Xinghua White opened up 210,000 yuan to 256,000 yuan. Xinghua Red was 150,000 yuan to 147,000 yuan. Shunde Green was 140,000 yuan to 137,800 yuan. The price of Dazhuang Green was 143,000 yuan, and the price of cotton red was 151,000 yuan.

<h3>Selling Pressure Envelops the Market - Yarn Prices Fall Step by Step</h3>
<p>The yarn market was even more sluggish yesterday. From the opening, it was always enveloped by selling pressure. There were few buyers, and the selling prices of various counts fell step by step. Although the market authorities had listed the prices of various counts sold by Fangjian on the 24th on the blackboard one by one, and repeatedly warned the industry to add only 5% as a legal profit, the actual transaction price was often lower than the price issued by Fangjian, and there were still few buyers, which shows the general downturn in transactions. At the close, the various prices were down another 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and people's minds were still extremely tired.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Prices See Downstream</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was initially stable yesterday, but the market was sluggish. It was heard that the Cotton Cloth Association would decide to carry out inventory registration, which made people feel tired, and people in the industry scrambled to sell, and floating households sold off one after another. The initial opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 140,000 yuan, then it retreated to 136,000 yuan, and finally it was 139,500 yuan. The price of Wufu once fell to 132,000 yuan, and finally it was 137,000 yuan. The prices of other colored cloth and Tulin cloth also saw downstream. In addition, Fangjian Company opened and sold various cloths as usual. The listed price of Wufu fine cloth was 137,000 yuan, and the listed price of Sijunzi and Jinyin Zhigong was 136,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were still stagnant yesterday. Only Xin Xin No. 6 Factory purchased 100 bales of Hankou fine lint cotton at a price of 560,000 yuan per dan. In addition, Xin Xin No. 2 Factory purchased 100 bales of Lingshi cotton at a price of 830,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Stable - Oil Market Retreats, Miscellaneous Grains Step Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 15,200 shih of rice arrived at the market. The Nanshi market was stable in the morning and tight in the afternoon, while the Beishi market was strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice had little rise or fall and was in a stable position. White yuan and yin yuan also had little fluctuation, and xian rice was similar. The transaction price of high-quality goods was 110,000 yuan for white japonica, 100,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan for thin rice, 104,000 yuan for early rice, and 101,000 to 3,000 yuan for yang xian rice. The price of white yuan was 118,000 to 125,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price adjustment for the oil market is under discussion, and the distribution of oil is in progress. A telegram from Qingdao reported that the market was tired and the shops were watching and waiting. The prices of all oils retreated by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The soybean cake was discontinued in various ports, and the price fell by 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The entrepot trade of soybeans was stagnant, and the street was quiet, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were rising and fixed, broad beans were fixed, mung beans were tired, and corn was stable in Qingdao, but firm in secret. Red sorghum was similar, raw peanuts were lively in the Guangdong and Nanyang markets, and continued to rise by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Sesame was fragrant and dry in the Nanyang market, and the price stepped up, reaching a high point and rising by another 10,000 yuan. Cotton cake fell by 2,000 yuan, cotton seeds were stable, and dried sweet potatoes were downstream with little trading.</p>
<h3>Promoting Foreign Sales to Southeast Asia: City Chamber of Commerce Collects Samples</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild, with the aim of expanding cotton cloth exports to Southeast Asia, has sent letters to its members to collect samples of various patterns. These samples are being sent to the City Chamber of Commerce for collation. The majority of the samples have already been collected, with cotton-silk blends being the most numerous. The Chamber is currently numbering and affixing them, and they will be sent out soon. The City Chamber of Commerce is initiating this promotion of exports to Southeast Asia for a wide variety of goods. All types of domestic products for which the domestic cost, combined with transportation to the region, can achieve a balanced export market price, are welcome to submit samples for joint dispatch. The Chamber is currently in discussions with various guilds.</p>
<h3>Silver Exchange Guild Continues to Petition for Permission to Operate Small-Amount Deposit Business; Drafts Seven Articles for Resumption of Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Money Exchange Guild yesterday again submitted a petition to the Central Bank, seeking permission to operate small-amount deposit business. Jiang Yuncheng, chairman of the guild, and standing directors Li Lansheng, Liu Xichen, and others, are scheduled to visit Central Bank Governor Bei today to represent the industry in their appeal. The guild's submission to the Central Bank is recorded as follows: "Submission regarding the continued request for permission to resume operating small-amount deposit business, in order to maintain livelihoods. Since the implementation of the three temporary measures for trading American dollars last autumn, our industry has been brought to a standstill, and maintaining operations has become difficult. On November 1, 1946, we submitted a document with proposed improvements, requesting approval. Now that the government has promulgated emergency economic measures, prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currencies, our entire industry has been brought to a standstill, and our lifeline has been cut off. The guild has over 200 members. There are many employees, and even more who rely on it indirectly for their livelihoods. If they lose their jobs, the public will be alarmed and unable to live in peace. Changing to another industry is neither what they are accustomed to, nor without difficulties. Therefore, after a meeting and discussion, it was decided that resuming the pre-war operation of small-amount deposit business is the most appropriate solution. It does not interfere with the government's financial control, and it also provides assistance to small businesses, industries, and ordinary people. The unemployment problem can also be solved. The benefits are numerous and appropriate. However, the previous proposal is not suitable for the current situation. We respectfully submit seven new articles for your review. You, in your position as Governor, oversee the economy and manage finance. We humbly request that you consider our situation and grant your approval. This would be a great service. Respectfully submitted to Central Bank Governor Bei."</p>
<p>Attached are the "Measures for Resuming Small-Amount Deposit Business": 1. Adjust the capital amount. 2. Comply with deposit reserve requirements. 3. Comply with all regulations regarding financial management. 4. Standardize the accounting system to facilitate audits by the competent authorities. 5. Change the name of all businesses to "Silver House" to ensure uniformity. 6. Limit membership to existing members. 7. Prevent the transfer of licenses and prohibit the replacement of key personnel.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Silver Shop Guild and Employees Petition Mayor Wu Yesterday, Requesting Him to Convey Their Grievances to the Relevant Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of the Silver Shop Guild, including Qiu Tianshi, Yao Yunwen, Yao Guiqing, Lao Tian[name unclear], Qiu Yunmin, Sun Jiejun of Lao Feng Xiang, and Fei Baihong of Qingyun, along with Zhang Dejun, chairman of the Employees' Union, and many representatives from Nanjing, Ningbo, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and other places, went to the Municipal Government at noon yesterday to petition Mayor Wu, personally delivering a written petition. Mayor Wu received them in the reception room. The representatives stated that the reason for repeatedly petitioning the authorities was due to economic hardship, adding that "those in the industry with heavier family burdens will soon face panic. The silver shop industry has always been law-abiding. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the emergency economic measures, it is tantamount to a death sentence. Therefore, we hope that the central government will allow the free buying and selling of decorative gold, so that the silver shop industry can continue to survive." After reviewing their petition, Mayor Wu stated that "the central government's promulgation of emergency economic measures was a last resort. Therefore, I hope the silver shop industry can consider the government's perspective and sacrifice themselves for the overall situation. Regarding the requests you have made, I am not the competent authority and have no power to respond. Currently, I can only suggest that you temporarily respect the central government's orders, and at the same time submit your requests to the relevant authorities." The representatives stated that they had visited Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi, but without success. They therefore appealed to Mayor Wu for assistance, requesting him to forward their petition and speak on their behalf, so that their plight could reach the higher authorities and rescue the silver shop industry from its dire situation. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his sympathy and said that he would do his best to help.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, the Shanghai silver shop industry, along with representatives from other cities, gathered at the New Capital Hotel to discuss the situation. They resolved that starting today, all petitioning representatives, more than seventy in total (including representatives from all over the country and labor representatives from Shanghai), would travel to Nanjing in batches to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant ministries, requesting changes to the six articles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the livelihoods of over a million silver shop employees nationwide.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Quantity of Second Batch of Silk Weaving Raw Materials Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The application for the second batch of raw materials from the Silk Weaving Joint Operation Company was submitted yesterday to the Business Management Office of the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Association. The second batch involves a total of 318 looms, requiring 40 bales of spun silk and 53 bales of rayon. The first batch of raw materials, totaling 200 bales of spun silk and 300 bales of rayon, has already been issued to 203 silk weaving factories, involving a total of 1,632 looms.</p>
<h3>Export of Eggs Basically Approved in Principle; Tung Oil Export Target of 50,000 Tons This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the export of eggs from our country has been approved in principle. Once the details are finalized, exports can begin. The main destination for our country's egg exports is currently the United Kingdom, and will likely start with frozen eggs. Before the war, our country's export volume of frozen eggs reached 40,000 to 50,000 tons annually. This year, approximately 9,000 tons can be shipped, equivalent to about 1.8 million British pounds. As the weather gradually warms, egg prices are also expected to gradually decrease. As of February 15, the market price for frozen eggs was approximately 230 to 240 British pounds per ton. The current price is around 210 British pounds, which is close to the British offer of 200 British pounds.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that based on last year's export situation for tung oil, it is expected that the export target of 50,000 tons can be achieved this year. Shanghai is expected to account for 70% of these exports, and Hong Kong for 30%. However, the current price of tung oil abroad is only 38 cents per pound, equivalent to 500,000 yuan per picul in our currency. While our current market price is 450,000 to 500,000 yuan per picul, making it difficult to initiate exports.</p>
<h3>Domestic Scented Tea Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Various types of domestic tea have seen increased activity from local shops and traders from Suzhou, especially jasmine-scented tea. There is a considerable quantity currently being inspected. However, sellers are demanding exceptionally high prices, reaching 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan per dan, which might make smooth transactions difficult. As for the foreign-operated tea market, British export companies are still inquiring about Keemun black tea, but are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the current high prices. There are still transactions and stable prices for other varieties such as Special Fine and Fine Hyson.</p>
<h3>Coal Sales are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Due to the warmer weather, sales of white coal are relatively weak. Due to the scarcity of supply, sellers are trying to maintain prices, resulting in sluggish transactions. Sales of bituminous coal have been picking up at lower prices, so prices have stopped falling and turned firmer. Supply and demand for firewood and charcoal are balanced, and prices are very stable. Due to a shortage of key raw materials, the quality of briquettes has been repeatedly reduced, and factory prices continue to rise. Users have mostly switched to other alternative fuels, so sales have slightly declined compared to before.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Jiaozuo Coal to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, has completed his inspection of coal mines in Taiwan and left by ship yesterday, expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow. Since the decision to allocate coal to public school teachers and staff, the monthly demand in Shanghai is 7,000 tons, and in Nanjing, with more civil servants, it is 8,000 tons, totaling 15,000 tons. It is understood that the Fuel Management Committee, in order to increase supply, sent a large number of personnel to the Jiaozuo coal mine. The transportation problem on the Pinghan Railway has also been resolved, so the first batch of Jiaozuo coal is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late March. The current unrest is hindering the effort to increase coal production. For example, the Fuel Management Committee was planning to send personnel to the Chuanshan coal mine, but the city had already fallen before they arrived. The Zhongxing coal mine has also been started twice but was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Flannel Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Fine wool flannels, both for suits and overcoats, and for men's and women's robes, which are in demand for spring, rose further in price yesterday. Both wholesale and retail prices increased across the board. Light gray colors were selling relatively actively, with local merchants making some purchases. Although most transactions were for single pieces, the trading was quite lively, as it is currently very difficult to place orders given the exchange rate, and costs invariably exceed market prices.</p>
<h3>Melton Cloth Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The market for Melton cloth turned downward yesterday. Some sellers were willing to sell at 480,000 to 490,000 yuan to raise cash. Although it will be difficult to order this product in the future, and the cost would be 700,000 yuan based on an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan per US dollar, demand has decreased due to the warmer weather and the end of the selling season. Holders, due to interest costs and the need to turn over capital for other goods, had no choice but to cut prices and sell, otherwise they would be stuck with the goods for months.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Utilize Loans to Purchase Wheat for Rationed Supply; Losses in the Past Will be Discussed for Subsidies</h3>
<p>The rationed flour supply in Shanghai, which began on the 22nd, is being supplied by the five major flour mills – Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong – using flour made from wheat purchased with a 2 billion yuan loan from the Joint Relief Association and 1.5 billion yuan raised by the mills themselves. Previously, it was agreed with the Municipal Government to purchase 50,000 shi of wheat from producing areas at a price of 5,100 yuan per dan for transportation to Shanghai to meet civilian needs. Now, because the supply plan for public school teachers and staff will be implemented in March, the purchase volume will be increased to 110,000 bags, which can last until the end of the month, requiring the funds to be turned over twice. Purchases are currently being made in three regions: Wuxi for Maoxin, Shanghai for Fuxin, and Taizhou for Fufeng. It is estimated that there are still 100,000 dan of stored wheat along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line, so there is no concern about procurement. Wheat from the Wuxi area has already begun to arrive in Shanghai, and the total amount received to date is more than 50,000 dan. The price per dan ranges from 70,000 yuan to the current purchase price of 82,000 yuan. The cost of producing each bag is 58,000 yuan. The controlled price in Shanghai is 30,000 yuan per bag for the factory and 31,500 yuan for retail. Losses for February will be 6 billion yuan. Representatives from the mills are currently in discussions with Mayor Wu. It is reported that the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Food are discussing subsidizing the losses by discounting the value of flour reserves. Details are pending. Furthermore, after the wheat ordered from abroad by the China Trust Bureau arrives in Shanghai and is unloaded in late March, other preferential measures will be determined, allowing the mills to choose between acting as processing agents and purchasers. In March, because public school teachers and staff will be the primary beneficiaries of the rationed flour, the amount sold to general consumers by noodle shops and other businesses will be greatly reduced. Several members of the fried dough stick and pancake industry, as well as the noodle industry, are privately reselling rationed flour on the black market, earning exorbitant profits. The Social Affairs Bureau is investigating the retail books of various stores and will impose punishments if offenses are confirmed. From August 19 to December 31 last year, the five flour mills supplied a total of 2.35 million bags of flour. This year, the number is 600,000 bags, totaling 2.9 million bags. Government subsidies consisted of 5,000 tons of wheat allocated by the China Trust Bureau, equivalent to 170,000 bags of locally produced wheat, and 160,000 bags of foreign flour. Because of the ban on exports from Shanghai and the controlled prices of flour, the mills are experiencing difficulties in maintaining profitability. However, along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line, there are more than 50 small and medium-sized flour mills that are profiting greatly by taking advantage of transshipments to North China.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Request Central Bank to Increase Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>Regarding tea purchase matters, tea merchant representative Sun Xiaocun went to the Central Bank yesterday afternoon to submit the Tea Merchants' Association members' general meeting resolution, requesting higher purchase prices, or allowing tea merchants to take back and export their products themselves, and granting a three-month grace period for repayment of past loans. According to a responsible person at the Central Bank, the request for higher purchase prices is unlikely to be approved because there was a previous agreement and it has already been reported to the central government. The tea merchants' request for an increase due to the current exchange rate adjustment does not seem reasonable. Regarding self-export, there will certainly be no problem if the Agricultural Bank loans are repaid. A three-month grace period for repayment of loans is also impossible. It is reported that the Central Bank will respond to the association today based on the above two reasons.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Rayon prices rose again yesterday. Due to widespread rumors that allocation would be suspended and allocation prices would increase, prices rose sharply immediately after the market opened. 120-count Takayama bright rayon opened at 7.1 million yuan, and then rose immediately. The closing price at noon was 7.4 million yuan. Prices were higher in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 7.7 million yuan, and then sold at 7.55 million yuan. Dealers traded among themselves at 7.5 million yuan. The mill business was quiet yesterday. There were no transactions by foreign firms. Users made transactions for 10 dan of D-grade rayon, priced at 7.8 million yuan. Dealers offered another dan at 6 million yuan, but there were no transactions. The silk goods trade was sparse, and prices were similar to the previous day. Only Hua Jin crepe saw an increase of 2-300 yuan due to the rise in rayon prices.</p>
<h3>Rayon Staple Fiber Approved for Import</h3>
<p>The Tianyuan Industrial Corporation, the exclusive agent for American Viscose Corporation's rayon staple fiber, previously requested permission to import it from the Executive Committee of the Import Temporary Management Commission. It is now reported that the request has been submitted by the Commission to the joint meeting of the Reclassification and Appeal Issues Subcommittee and the Tariff Issues Advisory Committee for their second meeting. The decision was that rayon staple fiber is to be treated as rayon and classified under tariff item 130 for import.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Temporarily Suspends Allocation of Rayon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Trust Bureau originally planned to allocate rayon on Monday, but temporarily suspended it due to unresolved pricing issues. Yesterday, the price of Takayama rayon had already reached a high of 7.5 million yuan. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau's rayon allocation is still awaiting President Song's approval of the allocation price before allocation can proceed.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Petitions Today for Relaxation of Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Guild, in order to request the relaxation of import quotas for Western medicines, has appointed Gu Keming, Chen Fenghao, Ge [name unclear] Sheng, Wu Zhiwei, Huang Suifeng, Ni [name unclear] Fu, and Chen Mingshan as representatives to petition the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee today. In addition, because the Western medicine quota for February to April of this year has been temporarily suspended, they are requesting that the Western medicine quota be included in the chemical quota for calculation.</p>
<p>The industry has also submitted a request to the Department of Health, requesting: (1) That 20% of the Western medicines allocated by the Materials Supply Bureau be paired with domestically produced Western medicines. (2) That there should be no distinction between Chinese and Western medicines when testing finished medicines. (3) That the finished medicines that have already been submitted for inspection should be certified as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Conservation of Foreign Exchange Resources; Difficult to Fulfill Requests for Relaxation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a responsible person at the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee: (1) The regulations of the office for the import quota of various items in the second category were carefully discussed and determined in advance by experts and people of insight from all parties. According to reliable statistics, the total value of imports of certain raw materials and machinery this year will reach US$472.59 million. However, the total foreign exchange resources available from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese for the whole year are only US$200 million. Therefore, in order to conserve foreign exchange, it will be difficult to fulfill requests from various industries for relaxation of quotas. (2) The import quota for newsprint is quite large among the import quotas for various items. However, the cultural sector still feels that it is insufficient. They will try to consider improvements in the next quarter. (3) The quota for tobacco is relatively large because the Ministry of Finance is considering the substantial tax revenue, which supplements the overall national income.</p>
<h3>Coconut Oil Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the large amount of arrivals of small Luzon coconut oil last year, the market price once fell from 320,000 yuan per dan to 130,000 yuan. Last winter, due to the prohibition of exports from Southeast Asia, import merchants suffered losses on most orders. Arrivals were scarce and sales increased sharply, so prices once rose to 800,000 yuan per dan. It is now reported that a certain merchant has imported more than 1,000 barrels of coconut oil (400 pounds per barrel). Due to the recent decline in actual sales, the asking price on the market yesterday was 400,000 yuan per dan, but there were no buyers.</p>
<h3>New York Hog Bristle Market Weak; Casing Prices to Be Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a cable received by hog bristle exporters in Shanghai from New York: The hog bristle market is quite weak. Chongqing bristles for delivery in New York are priced at US$2.70, Hankou No. 17 hog bristles at US$3.95, and Shanghai No. 17 bristles at US$2.00. New prices for hog bristles were seen in Shanghai yesterday. The new price for Chongqing bristles was 4 million yuan, Hankou bristles 5.6 million yuan, and Shanghai No. 17 bristles 3 million yuan. All goods saw transactions. The price of Sichuan and Hankou bristles has approached the New York market price. Only Hankou bristles are still about 1 million yuan below the foreign price.</p>
<p>New prices for casings have not been released since the exchange rate adjustment, and the situation has been deadlocked for a week. Yesterday afternoon, the casing industry held a meeting to discuss purchase prices, and new prices may be released today.</p>

<h3>Kaifeng, 18th [Day] Air Dispatch: Battle of Zhengzhuang Village</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent in Bian [Kaifeng], Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>General Wu Shaozhou's Battle Garments Stained with Blood: New Victory Stabilizes the Overall Situation in the Central Plains</p>
<p>At a time when the situation in the Eastern Henan battlefield was unimaginably tense, General Wu Shaozhou, who had long been renowned on the battlefield, led his reorganized 85th Division to the vicinity of Yejigang on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, joining the combat sequence to protect Eastern Henan. It was precisely because of the arrival of this elite force that the Communists were even more determined in their plan to focus on attacking the main forces of the Nationalists. And it was precisely because the Communists wanted to realize this plan that the Nationalists achieved this unprecedented great victory, which was the Battle of Dengzhuang Village from the night of the 12th of this month to 1:00 PM on the 13th. In this battle, in terms of results, the Nationalists achieved unprecedented success, with the Communists suffering over 15,000 casualties and prisoners, abandoning countless corpses and weapons, and losing their so-called "strong" fighting will. In terms of its value to the overall situation, it was a great victory, not only turning the precarious situation in the Central Plains from danger to safety and lifting the threat to Xuzhou, but also fundamentally shaking the Communists in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region. However, this battle was too tragic, too tragic to be described with pen and ink, so fierce as to be unbelievable. The Communists stormed into the village and occupied the courtyard directly across from General Wu's divisional headquarters. The Communists' storm-like grenades killed officers and soldiers around General Wu, and blood stained General Wu's battle garments. However, he still maintained a firm and calm command, achieving the expected results. This news, as soon as the battle ended, spread like a gust of wind to the besieged city of Kaifeng. Because there were no trains, and the Nationalist forces were still clearing the battlefield, it was not until sunset on the 15th that this reporter finally arrived at Zhengzhuang Village, four miles south of Yejigang – a very, very small village.</p>
<p>Reporting the Battle Situation in the Military Headquarters Tent: Trembling with Fear, Unable to Bear to Hear It</p>
<p>After getting off the train, stepping over corpses, and jumping into a jeep, amidst the rumbling of vehicles and the neighing of horses, [we] drove into the battered 85th Division headquarters in Zhengzhuang Village. After taking photos of the senior generals of the divisional headquarters amidst the bomb shrapnel and scattered firewood in the courtyard, I entered a small military headquarters tent with General Wu and others. The short, stocky, and courageous Deputy Division Commander Ni Zuyao began reporting the battle situation to me in a machine gun-like tone. He seemed to be in the midst of combat as he recounted the course of the battle, the tragic details of which made me tremble with fear and unable to bear to listen:</p>
<p>They were transferred from Northern Henan to Yejigang on the 9th and got off the train. As soon as they got off the train, the Communists treated them as their primary target. The 6th and 7th Columns attacked Zhengzhuang Village from the north of Suixian and Qixian, the 3rd Column attacked Zhengzhuang Village from the west of Minquan, and the 1st and 2nd Columns, under the command of Liu Bocheng, attacked from Wangqiao in the north towards the south. All distances were less than thirty li. Seeing this situation, General Wu, in order to seize the initiative, under these circumstances of "the mountain rain is about to come, and the wind fills the tower," dispatched the 67th Regiment of the 23rd Brigade eastward on the 10th to strike west of Minquan. After fighting for more than a day, they eliminated more than 700 Communists and captured more than 100 Communists. This was the prelude to this great battle.</p>
<p>Flesh and Blood Flying, Ghosts and Gods Weeping: Soldiers Throw Down Their Guns and Surrender</p>
<p>The small victory west of Minquan was the proximate cause that accelerated the outbreak of this great battle. On the 11th, the Communist forces on all fronts launched active offensives. Although they suffered strong resistance, in the face of overwhelming numerical superiority, they had approached the vicinity of Zhengzhuang Village.</p>
<p>On the night of the 12th, the brewing of this great battle reached its climax. Liu Bocheng summoned cadres above the regimental commander level in Wangqiao and gave a speech, saying: "This time we must capture Zhengzhuang Village, we must annihilate the 85th Division. If we defeat the 85th Division, I will invite everyone to Kaifeng to see a show. Everyone must strive to be worthy." In the darkness of the night, they were inspired by the god of war and mobilized like madmen. At this time, the Nationalist forces' deployment was as follows: the 85th Division headquarters was stationed in Zhengzhuang Village, with the exception of a company directly under [HQ], there was also an engineer battalion and an infantry battalion. The 23rd Brigade of the division was stationed in Linzhuang, three li west of Zhengzhuang Village, the 110th Brigade was stationed in Zhuzhuang, four li east of Zhengzhuang, and the friendly 72nd Division was stationed entirely in Yejigang. The Communist forces used a part of the 1st and 3rd Columns to attack the 72nd Division in Yejigang. In addition, the entire 2nd Column, with six reinforced regiments, and the entire 6th and 7th Columns, fiercely attacked Zhengzhuang Village. A part of the 3rd Column attacked the 110th Brigade in Zhuzhuang, and the 5th Column attacked the 23rd Brigade in Linzhuang.</p>
<p>The battle began at 11:00 PM that night. After discovering the enemy situation, the Zhengzhuang Village defenders began firing artillery. Then the Communist forces in the south had forced their way into the firing range of the Nationalist machine guns. From then on, a network of fire was formed on and outside the village walls. Rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, hand grenades, and mortars all fired continuously, with firepower reaching its peak. Men shouted, horses screamed, ghosts cried, and gods wailed. People fell one after another, and flesh and blood flew. Under the cover of intense firepower, the Communist forces outside the village crawled forward. They jumped into the village moat but were blown up in the water by hand grenades from the village walls. They climbed up the village walls but were stabbed and rolled back into the village moat. The war became more and more tragic. In the firelight, countless attackers were seen falling to the ground, and one after another, the village walls were seen collapsing. However, no one wavered. At 3:00 AM, the north village gate was once broken through by the Communist forces, but after the defending troops eliminated them, they blocked it again. At 3:30 AM, the artillery fire thinned slightly, but after a burst of bugle calls, in the firelight, the Communist forces, like a surging tide outside the village, desperately ran towards the southwest corner of the village. In an instant, the firepower was concentrated on the southwest corner of the village, like a violent storm, unstoppable. At 4:00 AM, the 16th Regiment of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Column of the Communist forces, led by Regiment Commander Song Dongxu, under the cover of strong firepower, after five or six failed attempts, finally used ladders to storm into Zhengzhuang Village. An even more tragic battle unfolded inside the village. Corners of walls and rooftops all became battlefields. A road and a house were all being contested with flesh and blood. Every minute and every second was performing a tragic and heroic drama. Only machine guns and hand grenades roared and exploded wildly, and other weapons had lost their effectiveness. The two sides jumped back and forth on the slopes of the houses and moved around in the holes in the walls, attacking and defending each other, advancing as the other retreated, like a seesaw, like grinding a millstone. After fighting bitterly like this for more than an hour, the Communist forces finally advanced fifty meters and occupied the courtyard across from the divisional headquarters. This was the location of the 85th Division's staff office, less than ten meters from the divisional headquarters. The courtyard of the divisional headquarters became the overall target of the Communist hand grenades and machine guns. General Wu's staff officers and guards were killed one after another by the explosions. However, the Communist forces could not advance any further. The defenders began using fire attacks. Under the command of General Wu's radio, the 23rd Brigade and the 110th Brigade outside the village also narrowed the encirclement and concentrated their forces inside the village. As a result, the Communist forces who had not entered the village, under heavy pressure, scattered, abandoning corpses everywhere and throwing away their helmets and armor. The Communist forces in Yejigang also retreated under the strong attacks of the 72nd Division. The Communist forces inside the village, seeing that they were insurmountable and knowing that their escape route was cut off, also wavered. Soldiers wanted to lay down their arms, and officers wanted to surrender. Therefore, in that most urgent situation, the officers above the company commander level in that regiment held a meeting. After analyzing the situation at that time, Regiment Commander Song did not express his opinion on retreat and surrender because the political commissar was present, but he conveyed this opinion to the company commanders with his eyes. The first company commander took the lead in advocating the surrender of weapons, but the political commissar shot him dead first. Seeing this situation, Regiment Commander Song was forced to lead the attack again, but Regiment Commander Song was the first to be killed in action. The rest also fell to the ground one after another. Only the political commissar was still supervising the battle, but by 8:00 AM, the political commissar was also killed by his own men. The remaining three hundred officers and soldiers still resisted in the houses. Among them, a small number of soldiers who were no longer monitored and oppressed by the officers threw out their guns and surrendered. At this time, the Nationalist forces' fire attack made the remaining Communist forces unable to advance or retreat, unable to fly away even if they had wings, and many were burned to death.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the 110th Brigade was the first to send a battalion into the village. By 11:00 AM, the Communist forces in the village were completely annihilated. Scattered battles outside ended at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Splendid Victory and Pride: Who is Harming Compatriots?</p>
<p>In this tragic battle, the Nationalist forces achieved a glorious victory. 2,100 corpses of Communist soldiers were found. 4,567 wounded Communist officers and soldiers were captured. 900 Communist officers and soldiers were taken prisoner. The total number of Communist deaths in the battle was approximately 15,000. 397 rifles, 30 light machine guns, 10 heavy machine guns, and 15 artillery pieces of various sizes were captured. From the perspective of the war alone, this victory was extremely glorious. However, after Deputy Division Commander Ni finished his report, General Wu Shaozhou said in a somber and sincere tone: "The tragedy of this battle is unprecedented. Although this division, in cooperation with the friendly 72nd Division, achieved this victory, we do not want to boast or be proud. On the contrary, we feel very saddened because those killed were all our compatriots. Who is harming them? We really don't want to fight them!"</p>
<p>Pitiful Bones on the Edge of Zhengzhuang Village: Still Yearning for Loved Ones in Spring Dreams</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, accompanied by a staff officer from the divisional headquarters, the reporter climbed the village walls to inspect the battlefield. The earth was filled with murderous intent, and the cold wind drove people back. Looking out over the fields, corpses were piled up, and small fires flickered. Looking down at the village moat, red water had formed ditches, and floating corpses were piled up. The tragic scene was simply unbearable to look at. Filled with grief, my mind recalled two old lines of poetry: "Pitiful bones by the Han River, still yearning for loved ones in spring dreams!" With tears in my eyes and gritting my teeth, I was forced by the sad emotions to descend from the city walls.</p>
<p>Broken Walls and Ruins Like a Land of Ghosts: Searching Everywhere for Bloody Rags</p>
<p>Inside the village, there were corpses of humans and animals everywhere, and broken walls and ruins everywhere. Not a single resident was seen, not a single chicken or dog was seen, not a single intact tree was seen, and there was no place that was not covered in blood. Bullet marks were scattered everywhere, and shrapnel was piled up everywhere. Tree branches lay scattered horizontally and vertically, and bloody rags were everywhere. In ordinary people's homes, there were walls but no homes, rooms but no windows, windows but no doors, doors but no people. Those who died had died, and those who had not died had fled. The human world had turned into a land of ghosts.</p>
<h3>New Scenes of Fuzhou: Air Dispatch from Fuzhou, 10th [Day]</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>Black rats and white rice have caused an uproar in Fuzhou and have become the news center of Fuzhou. Death and famine, who doesn't fear them! Last year, Fuzhou suffered a major plague of rats. Because prevention was not thorough, how many people died under the rats is unknown. There is still lingering fear. Therefore, this year, the epidemic prevention agencies have prepared various necessary measures for rat prevention early, such as universal injections and rural mobile epidemic prevention publicity, with the intention of fighting the rats with their backs to the city. A grand health exhibition was held in the city a few days ago, displaying various dead rat specimens, which was shocking. The number of visitors reached 30,000, showing how deep the impression of rats is on the people of Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Returned Overseas Chinese Gathered: Sighing for No Ships</p>
<p>It is heard that most of the overseas Chinese in the eastern counties are from Gutian. With the assistance of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration (行總) and the United Relief Administration (聯總), hundreds of overseas Chinese from Fuzhou and its surrounding counties were sent back to their old places to restart their businesses by the Wanfu Shilin [ship] at the beginning of last month. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office复会 [met again] with the Executive Yuan Relief Administration’s Fujian Office to handle the repatriation of overseas Chinese from various parts of Myanmar. In recent days, more than a thousand people have registered, and about five hundred have been approved to come to Fuzhou for gathering. The special transportation for repatriated overseas Chinese was originally scheduled to arrive in Fuzhou in mid-month, but it has recently been heard that it will have to wait until next month before ships can be allocated to come to Fuzhou. These nearly five hundred overseas Chinese are now gathered in the city of Fuzhou, and they are all worried because they hear that they cannot leave in a short period of time. Recently, vehicles with the words "Special Vehicle for Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country" can be seen traveling back and forth on the streets, probably because they live in the city, and special vehicles are used to send them to the Taijiang District for meals every day. This is inconvenient for the overseas Chinese themselves, and it also places a heavy burden on the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and the United Relief Administration authorities responsible for the repatriation. An overseas Chinese told the reporter that the Executive Yuan Relief Administration should not have gathered them so quickly before being fully prepared, as this increases their travel fatigue.</p>
<p>Prices Are Skyrocketing: Long-Distance Phones Busy</p>
<p>Recently, prices have soared, with grain prices taking the lead. If luxury goods are expensive, you can do without them, but when you are hungry, how can you not eat rice? The price of rice in Fuzhou is like a wild horse, uncontrollable. Not only is the price different in the morning and evening, but it also changes in an instant. At the time the reporter wrote, the price of rice had climbed to a high of 160,000 yuan. As usual, when the price of grain rises, the municipal government holds meetings with relevant agencies to discuss and resolve to suppress the price of rice, or releases a small amount of grain at a low price. However, without grasping the core of the problem, the results are minimal. The press in Fuzhou criticizes the municipal government, saying that poor management is the fundamental problem, and we must face reality.</p>
<p>Because of the rising price of rice, many people in difficult circumstances have switched to eating coarse grains. Moreover, the rice [sellers] took the opportunity to raise the price of coarse grains as well. When they can't afford coarse grains either, they can only wait for the misfortune of famine to strike. The general public is worried about the price of grain, and the municipal government is helpless, and the common people are even more helpless. Only the activity of the rice weevils can be seen. They have murderous looks on their faces, as if they are facing a great enemy, strategizing in the military tent. The long-distance telephone business in Fuzhou has been particularly brisk recently. Eight or nine out of ten people waiting to make calls are wealthy merchants. With their orders, they have seized many opportunities! They are almost fighting the municipal government.</p>
<p>Poor Households Account for 60,000 of More Than 80,000 Households</p>
<p>According to vague statistics, poor households account for 60,000 of the more than 80,000 households in Fuzhou. Of course, these poor households are divided into small poor, big poor, and extremely poor, but the circumstances of poverty are not too different. At first, they had full hopes for the relief efforts carried out by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, but the facts repeatedly disappointed them. Taking winter relief as an example: the long process of meetings, discussions, and reviews goes from winter to spring and is still "about to be distributed soon." These poor households are in an increasingly miserable situation of hunger and cold in the face of the biting north wind and high prices. The reporter inspected the slum areas, and they were all gathered in groups of three or five in dilapidated houses, using scraps of branches and wood to make fires for warmth. Whether old or young, they were all withered and lacked human form, making a living by begging for leftovers or picking up rotten vegetable leaves to cook and eat. Most of the elderly are no longer willing to move around and are not afraid of death. They have little interest in the so-called "relief." When winter relief is mentioned, they mostly look indifferent, which is truly shameful for the gentlemen of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration.</p>
<p>Everyone knows how the relief efforts in Fuzhou are being handled. After Lin Rongsen, the former deputy director of the Fujian-Zhejiang branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, was dismissed for embezzlement and dereliction of duty, the institutions and personnel of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration in Fujian underwent a major change. However, administrative efficiency has not improved, and the bureaucratization of personnel and the officialization of affairs are the focus of criticism.</p>
<p>Plans as Decoration: Boldly Laying Off Staff</p>
<p>The 36th year of the Republic is a new year, and all agencies will inevitably come up with a grand administrative plan. Roads are to be repaired, water conservancy is to be developed, and industry and commerce are to be managed. It seems that all kinds of government affairs are to be handled. However, it is best not to mention money, like "a horse that can run fast and not eat grass." This year's provincial government budget is only 30 billion yuan, of which 23 billion yuan is needed to eat. There is little left. What can be done? Therefore, the plan is a plan, just for decoration. The provincial fisheries bureau's annual operating expenses are less than one million yuan, which is one example. In this era, being able to maintain the status quo is a first-class role, and everyone encourages each other with this.</p>
<p>Various agencies are laying off staff and reducing government expenses with great fanfare. The provincial party headquarters laid off three-quarters of its 204 employees, leaving only 45 people. The provincial government laid off staff last September, and the municipal government is already considering laying off staff. There are dozens of female employees in the municipal tax bureau, and the mayor said that the city's financial support today is limited, so they might as well take on family relief work as well, and the female employees are likely to be the first to be on the blacklist. As soon as staff is laid off, the unemployment line is strengthened day by day. The unemployment problem in Fuzhou today is quite serious.</p>
<p>Power Outages, Petty Thieves Emerge, Lamenting Songs, No Meat to Eat</p>
<p>Mentioning the Fuzhou Electric Company is a headache! Fuzhou does not have running water facilities. The only modern public utilities are cars and electric lights. The old and ailing motors of the electric light factory are a major cause of power outages, and the company's mismanagement also provides an opportunity for criticism. The Fuzhou Electric Company says that the reason why the power goes out repeatedly is that too much electricity is stolen by special classes, and the motors cannot bear the load. Moreover, the electricity bills are repeatedly raised, and some users have to pay as much as a thousand yuan per kilowatt-hour. It is unfair for general users to bear the electricity bills for the electricity-stealing class. When the power goes out at night, it is the time when petty thieves are active. Many cases of theft have occurred in the dark. For example, the Dajianguo Western Clothing Store in Nanmendou had dozens of bolts of woolen cloth stolen during a power outage. The people of Fuzhou all have complaints about the Electric Company.</p>
<p>Fuzhou newspapers report that so-called special classes are causing trouble by forcibly purchasing pork, causing butchers to strike. They have not tasted meat for five days. Who are these special classes? Everyone knows it but doesn't say it, as if they are masked heroes. Because the butchers have been on strike for five days, the municipal government has lost nearly ten million yuan in pork tax. Butchers in Linsen County transport pork to Fuzhou City and sell it at black market prices, which creates a new problem of unclear boundaries between Linsen County and Fuzhou City. The people of Fuzhou sing in lament: "No meat to eat, insufficient nutrition; no car to ride, difficult to walk."</p>

<h3>Complex Political Situation: A Complete Picture of Liaobei in Thailand; A Heavy Task of Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Aired from Changchun on the 12th, by our reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>Liaobei Province, on the new map of the nine northeastern provinces, is a long corridor running northwest to southeast. It borders Andong to the east, Jilin, Nenjiang, and Xing'an to the north, Chahar to the west, and Rehe and Liaoning to the south. Liaobei governs a total of ten counties: Changtu, Hailong, Liaoyuan, Lishu, Kaiyuan, Xifeng, Xi'an, Dongfeng, Tongliao, and Changling; as well as eight Mongolian banners: the Front, Middle, and Rear Banners of the Right Wing of Horqin, the Front, Middle, and Rear Banners of the Left Wing of Horqin, the Jalaid Banner, and the Ghorlos Banner. Its area is 89,021 square kilometers, with a population of 3,864,321. The administrative problems of Liaobei are quite complex. On its narrow map, the area of the Mongolian banners accounts for half. Going northwest from Tongliao, one enters the hinterland of the Mongolian nomadic people. (The Mongolian banners within the Northeast and Rehe are collectively known as "Eastern Mongolia.") "Eastern Mongolia" is a region whose social state is isolated from the interior and whose political situation is complex.</p>
<p>I remember in mid-February of this year, when the fervent student patriotic movement spread across the motherland, and the ranks of patriotic youth parading and demonstrating showed a new Great Wall of flesh and blood, the so-called Eastern Mongolian People's Autonomous Army was stirring up a whirlwind of perverse actions on the Mongolian grasslands. These descendants of Genghis Khan have historically experienced many "storms." The command post of "Eastern Mongolian Autonomy" was located at the Wangye Temple in the Front Banner of the Right Wing of Horqin, and Liaobei contained the nerve center of this alienated part.</p>
<p>Liaobei, as a province, can be said to be another society, another political unit, and another economic unit. In "administration," both aspects must be taken into account. The reconstruction work in Liaobei is much heavier than in other provinces. Since the National Army entered Liaobei in February of this year until now, Liaobei has gradually recovered, and the outlook for this year's provincial administration is worth mentioning. It is divided into civil affairs, finance, education, construction, and Mongolian banners, and each item is described below:</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Work: Initial Foundation Laid</p>
<p>Since the National Army stationed in Liaobei until now, the counties and cities have been taken over one after another. However, in recovering the counties and cities, with the exception of Siping City, Xi'an, and Lishu, which were completely taken over, a small number of streets and villages were occupied by the Communist Army, disrupting the local area. The Communist Army took over the three banners of the Left Wing of Horqin, and the remaining five banners are still under the control of the Communist Army. The most noteworthy thing is, of course, the Mongolian banners. The Communist Army once gave them a propaganda talk, inciting the centrifugal force of the Mongolian people.</p>
<p>The establishment of the initial buds of local autonomy in the post-liberation administration work has involved two important tasks: one is the establishment of public opinion institutions below the provincial level, and the other is the election of local public officials. The establishment steps of public opinion institutions are to convene village class people's congresses in rural areas, organize temporary street village district people's congresses, and discuss matters of reform. This work was completed in early August last year. The preparations for the municipal, county, and banner temporary participation conferences were hastily and sloppily handled. Some counties were taken over very late, and the election of representatives inevitably had some accusations. Many vacancies are still reserved for later candidates. This kind of temporary participation conference is only to awaken the attention of the people. Each county was established from mid-September to mid-October. For the sake of a solemn ceremony, Chairman Liu's three instructions of "opening," "meeting," and "closing" took the lead. The form looked like democracy from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The provincial temporary participation conference was elected on November 5 and announced its establishment on November 11. The situation was roughly the same as that of the county, city, and banner temporary participation conferences. From December 15 to 22, the first meeting was held for ten days, comprehensively reviewing the provincial administration work and making various suggestions. It was the initial foundation for local autonomy. The public was very indifferent to the election. On the one hand, it was the result of the enemy's and puppet's fourteen years of high-pressure politics. On the other hand, with today's raging war, the people's livelihood is uncertain, and the public is groaning under the high pressure of life and has no time to take care of politics.</p>
<p>Secondly, land administration work is quite cumbersome and complicated. In the months from after "August 15" to February of the 35th year, drastic land reforms like a storm attacked the countryside. Chinese people took back the land from the Japanese, and the Communist Party divided the land from the landlords to the poor. The society had no laws to follow, and all the methods were unconventional, and the rural order was very chaotic. Farmers tumbled in the land turmoil and did not get any benefits. The fruits of land production were all swallowed by rioters, and the countryside was rapidly going bankrupt, with a lack of labor and barren cultivated land. The Japanese left, and the Communist Party left, leaving behind a bad land debt to be cleared up. The Liaobei Provincial Government divided it into three items: 1. Organizing land registration maps, 2. Handling land administration cases that have not been concluded, 3. Formulating various regulations and methods related to land administration matters to adjust land administration and resolve land ownership disputes.</p>
<p>Frequent Wars, Difficult People's Livelihood</p>
<p>"Poor people and exhausted wealth" is the host of Liaobei today. Since the restoration, it has experienced turmoil, and people's livelihood has reached its extreme. As a result of the Communist Army's occupation and disruption of Liaobei, local security work is difficult. Judging from the ratio of provincial and county financial expenditures, the allocation of security local team recruitment and regular expenses is a large amount. The total budget for the province in the 35th year is about 1.05 billion yuan, and the expenditure of security teams accounts for 560 million yuan, accounting for more than one-half. Administrative expenses are second, and subsidies for counties, cities, and banners are second. Therefore, the expenses of the province, counties, cities, and banners are very difficult. At that time, the Xingyuan only provided 4 million yuan per month, which was not enough to maintain the provincial administration. The provincial finance is subordinate to the central government and has no independent tax source. The counties, cities, and banners form their own system. Since most of the rural areas have been recovered, the people are in dire straits, and commerce and industry are declining. The source of tax revenue is exhausted, and the expenses are extremely difficult. Some county and banner chiefs are not very affluent in their travel expenses to take office.</p>
<p>After the National Financial Conference closed in June last year, the land tax and business tax were assigned to local tax collection. This is the two major sources of provincial and county funding. The handling situation is described below:</p>
<p>The standard for land tax collection in kind is based on the amount calculated by combining the regular and supplementary taxes in the twelfth year of the puppet Manchukuo (ie, the 34th year of the Republic of China). The old tax quota is 30 city pounds of sorghum for every yuan, and each pound is discounted at 5 yuan in circulation coupons. After Liaobei is fully recovered, it is expected to collect 3.1 billion yuan throughout the year. The actual income last year was only 1.3 billion yuan. The sharing standard at all levels is that the central government gets 12%, the province gets 16.8%, and the county (city banner) and street village get 71.2%. The land tax collection in kind failed to reach the predetermined amount due to the exodus of farmers and the barren cultivated land. Compared with the collection standards in Guannei, the Northeast is lower, but considering the tragic destruction of the Northeast, even the lower burden is felt to be serious. The farmers in Zhizhu Village, Lishu County, Liaobei took the lead and formed a petition group at the end of last year to request the provincial government to exempt land tax. Chairman Liu agreed to reduce it by 60%, but the representatives were not satisfied and decided to petition the Northeast Xingyuan. This is the wave that farmers are boiling up in pain.</p>
<p>The total amount of business tax to be taxed in the 35th year is about 1.435 billion yuan. According to the current business tax rate of 1.5%, the total amount of business tax revenue is 66 million yuan. Because the province's commerce is declining and most of the stores are closed, only 60% can be calculated, and the actual income is more than 39.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>Liaobei is known as a warehouse area, and grain stone tax is also one of the most promising tax revenues. The provincial government has drafted collection methods and submitted them to the Xingyuan for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>The financial needs of counties, cities, and banners are huge, but the source of tax revenue is not abundant. The Xingyuan stipulates that the original tax items of the puppet Manchukuo should be collected first, and no new taxes should be added in order to be considerate of the people's difficulties. However, due to the tragic destruction of the counties, the tax revenue is very difficult, and the income and expenditure of each county are not enough, and the losses are very large.</p>
<p>In addition, the local taxes such as the use of spleen license tax, livestock donation, and fruit donation are increased in accordance with the price index, which greatly benefits the local finance. The immovable property acquisition donation, fishery tax, special product donation, and land tax are all abolished.</p>
<p>Mongolian People's Economy: Extremely Frustrated</p>
<p>The situation in half of Liaobei has not yet stabilized. The Mongolian banners are too deeply isolated from the interior, and the Mongolian people have their political demands and are tempted and influenced by external factors and violence. At present, only the army can enter the Mongolian banners, and ordinary people cannot enter the Mongolian banners. The government's takeover of the Mongolian banners is still led by the army. This is due to the special situation in Inner Mongolia, but the failure of political and economic coordination with the demands of the Mongolian people is a major shortcoming. Chairman Liu Handong has limited knowledge of the Mongolian banners. When I asked Mr. Zhang Jia'ao about the economic problems of the Mongolian banners, he also said that he had not studied them. Today, the two major problems of the Mongolian banners are the land disputes between Mongolians and Han Chinese. According to the Mongolian people, the grassland belt they have conserved is the last lifeline, and the resettlement of Han Chinese has threatened their life money. "If you die of hunger, you would rather fight for the sheep" has become a political slogan. Secondly, the livestock fur of the Mongolian people cannot find a market in the turbulent Northeast. Due to the interruption of transportation, the problem of entering the field has become a major problem, which has caused heavy losses to the Mongolian people. The demand to break the economic depression is an important factor in political impulses. Today, the primary problem in Liaobei lies in this.</p>

<p>Another Call for Abandoned Corpses by the Roadside</p>
<p>Editor: The avenues that we must pass to and from work are Lyuban Road and Luban Road. Luban Road is an unclean street. In the section between the shops and the Chaohui Villa (cemetery), it was originally an open space. Last summer, a group of refugees came and built some thatched huts in this open space by the roadside as their residences. Their lives are simple, and the thatched huts are full of darkness and dirt. The roadside is covered with sewage and garbage, and no one cares. Further south from this thatched hut, outside the wall of the Chaohui Villa's southern end, that place can be said to be an open-air mortuary. Many people abandon corpses in that place. Most of these corpses are infant corpses, so they are all wrapped in broken straw mats and bags. Some are exposed with their hands and feet, and there are very few wooden boxes. I think there must be some who starved to death, but I am afraid that more died from infectious diseases. Moreover, it often takes three to five weeks or more for no one to collect them, which is a great threat to the nearby people. As the weather gets warmer, the danger is unimaginable. Our agency previously informed the local police and the Municipal Health Bureau by letter. After more than two weeks, those corpses were still piled up. Our agency usually has foreign consultants coming and going. When I think about what would happen if they found this situation, may I ask if this is adding to our society's stains?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am using your newspaper's space to expose this inhuman and unsanitary living hell. I believe that the municipal authorities should strictly prohibit the common people from abandoning corpses at will, and should send people to check at any time, and immediately bury the abandoned corpses. (Shi Yiming) Editor's Note: On the 14th of this month, Wen Shengjun made a similar appeal, which has already been published. Today, Yimingjun made the above statement again, which should be disclosed again for the health authorities to check and improve.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>It is said that history is cyclical. This is a very cruel prediction. Everyone wants to deny it, but it seems that no one has the courage to firmly deny it. "Take the past as a mirror, and you can know the rise and fall." History originally wanted us not to take those old roads, but in fact it stubbornly clings to some long-standing human suffering and teaches us to taste it. And the cycle of history seems to have become an iron fact.</p>
<p>At the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, there was already a strong accusation against political insecurity and the turmoil of the times. "Big rat, big rat, I will leave you." This is the cry of a fugitive. "I entered from outside, and the people in the room all accused me." This is the cry of a small public official. "I look around, and I am at a loss where to go." This is a common saying of someone who is worried about the times. Although these were written by people more than two thousand years ago, do we not feel that these are the languages that we heard people say just yesterday!</p>
<p>Far away seventeen hundred years ago, there was a woman named Cai Wenji who was captured by the chaotic soldiers of the civil war. She wrote a poem with tears and blood, titled "Grief and Anger." Although Chinese poets teach gentleness and sincerity, when they experience the most tragic circumstances, they have no choice but to be both resentful and angry. The "Grief and Anger" poem, recorded over seven hundred years ago, is still vividly in our minds.</p>
<p>"Zhuo's army came under the car, and the golden armor shone with sunlight. On flat land, people are weak, and the soldiers are all Hu Qiang. In the wild, the cities and towns, all that passed were destroyed.斩截 no survivors, corpses supported each other. Hanging people's heads beside the horse, carrying women behind the horse. Driving west into the pass, the return route is dangerous and obstructed. Looking back at the vast distance, the liver and spleen are rotten. There are tens of thousands of people who have been captured, and they are not allowed to gather together. Some have flesh and blood together, but they dare not speak. If they are unhappy, they will say that they will kill the surrendered captives. They will be cooked with a knife. 'I will not let you live.' If you dare to cherish your life, you cannot bear the suffering. Or they will add extreme punishments, and poisons and torments will be used together.</p>
<p>"And then they cry and walk, and at night they sit and grieve. They cannot die if they want to, and there is nothing they can do if they want to live. What is the crime of the blue sky, that they should encounter such a disaster..."</p>
<p>Almost at the same time as "Grief and Anger," Wang Can wrote his "Seven Sorrows" poem, recording what he saw when he went to Liuzhou from Chang'an at the age of seventeen, which was just the Dong Zhuo Rebellion.</p>
<p>"The western capital is chaotic and without images, and jackals and tigers are plotting against each other. They abandoned China again and entrusted themselves to Jingman. They abandoned China again, and friends chased each other. There was nothing to see when they went out, and white bones covered the plain! There was a hungry woman on the road, holding her child and abandoning it in the grass. She heard the sound of crying and sobbing, wiped her tears and did not return. 'I don't know where I will die, how can I complete both?' She drove her horse and abandoned it, unable to bear to hear this sound. She climbed the bank of Baling in the south and looked back at Chang'an. She realized that the people under the spring were sighing and hurting their hearts."</p>
<p>In times of great chaos, mothers even abandon their children, sadly saying: "I don't know where I will die, how can I complete both!" These ten words are truly written with infinite fresh blood! Everyone who fled west through Xianggui in the 33rd year must have engraved in their hearts the meaning of this poem. At that time, I was fortunate to be traveling south, carrying my three-year-old daughter out of the 600-mile Lian Mountain. But I saw the tragic scene of white bones covering the plain in more than one place. When I passed through a prosperous city that had tens of thousands of residents not long ago and could not find a complete old house, my mood was like Wang Can looking at Chang'an.</p>
<p>In the 31st year, I passed through the area of Xiangtan, Changsha, and Liling, just when the farmers were busy. Women were often seen working in the fields. In that area, the custom was that women never went to the fields. So I remembered the nursery rhyme during the reign of Emperor Huan: "The wheat is green and the barley is withered, who will be the one who does the work? It is the wife and the aunt. You have a car, please drum the dragon flute for you!" And Du Fu also had a similar sentence: "Since there are strong women holding hoes and plows, the seedlings are born in the ridges without east or west." But what describes the most tragic conscription is Chen Lin's "Drinking Horses at the Great Wall Cave": "There are many strong men and few young men in the border city, and there are many widows in the inner house. Write a letter to the inner house, and marry and do not stay. Serve the new mother-in-law well and always look at my old husband!" How few such letters of blood and tears have there been in the past ten years!</p>
<p>The one who wrote the most poignant description of turmoil is Du Fu. His Three Officials (Shi Hao Official, Tongguan Official, Xin'an Official) and Three Separations (Separation without a Home, Separation after Marriage, Separation in Old Age) should be included in the world's most realistic tragedies. He himself narrated what he had experienced, such as "Going to Fengxian to Sing about My Feelings," "When I entered the door, I heard wailing, and my young son had already starved to death." I was fortunate not to have reached that point. But like "Tonight the moon in Fuzhou, the woman in the boudoir only looks at it alone, remotely pitying the young children, who do not understand to miss Chang'an," like "Wife and children were surprised that I was there, and after they were surprised, they wiped away their tears. In the middle of the night, they held candles and looked at each other as if in a dream," like "All my brothers are scattered, and no one asks about life and death," like "The pampered child does not leave my lap, but is afraid of me and goes away again," etc., are all things that make me cry every time I read them. The "Peng Ya Xing" writes about the journey in the midst of turmoil, carrying his wife and children, stumbling on a difficult road, which is really a portrayal of my escape into the Jinxiu Yao Mountain in the winter of the 33rd year. I think today there will still be countless people reading this poem, feeling sad about the past and the present, and crying sadly.</p>
<p>"I remember when I first avoided the thieves, I went north through dangerous difficulties. Deep in the night, the Peng Ya Road, the moon shone on the White Water Mountain. I walked for a long time in the painting room, and I often met people with thick faces. The valley birds sang in disorder, and I did not see the returning wanderer. The foolish girl bit me because she was hungry, and cried for fear that the tigers and wolves would hear. I covered her mouth in my arms, and she turned and scolded me in a low voice. The little child tried to understand, so he asked for bitter plums. It had not rained for ten days, and the mud was slippery and we stumbled on each other. Since there was no rain gear, the road was slippery and the clothes were cold. Sometimes we went through hardships, and we only traveled a few miles all day long. We filled our stomachs with wild fruits, and we made roofs with humble branches. We drew water on the stones early in the morning, and we slept in the smoke on the horizon at dusk..."</p>
<p>Even Li Shangyin, who is famous for his beauty, has the following sentences: "Children and grandchildren are not yet born, and they are abandoned without grief. They will no longer discuss where to go, but only wish to die in the mountains." Han Wei, who wrote boudoir poems, also sadly chanted, "The water flows slowly and the sun slants, there are no chickens or dogs, only the cries of crows. Thousands of villages and thousands of houses are like cold temples, and you can only see flowers but no people!</p>
<p>Eight years of resistance against Japan, one year of demobilization, and the civil war, which we do not know when it will end, make us reread the works of people a thousand or two thousand years ago, as if they were living in this era again. Western legends say that a ghost will come back to life after death: sin will be repeated again and again. But if history is really cyclical, then the fate of Huang Chao, An Lushan, and Dong Zhuo has already been doomed.</p>
<p>Did the ancients not already say: "Heaven's way is good to return." And also said: "Only soldiers are ominous." And also said: "A soldier is like fire, and if he is not cheap, he will burn himself." And also said: "It can carry a boat, and it can overturn a boat." When it reaches a certain limit, the ancient ignorant and docile people will also say: "When will the sun perish, I will perish with you!" One day, the docile sheep will become fierce lions.</p>
<p>This era is dyed with blood, and the blood is flowing more and more vast. I will borrow the sentences of the ancients to describe this period of turmoil. High hall peeps, white hair is mottled. I dare not say whether I still have the strength to write new poems, but I firmly believe that there will be such poems, and I can read them. (February of the 36th year)</p>
<h3>Love</h3>
<p>— Soviet Union. He Gaier</p>
<h3>Writing My Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Lifting up my head and opening my eyes, it's a series of annoying, boring, cunning, and deceitful things... Life is like a net, life is like a prison, and it buries life without hesitation.</p>
<p>No words, everything that needs to be said has been said. If I were deaf, blind, and dumb, I believe it wouldn't necessarily be painful—no, I believe it would be happiness. The fabricated world must be much stronger than this ugly real world.</p>
<p>I love freedom, I like to soar. I'm stubborn, I'm stubborn. Alas, to this real world, I'm angry.</p>
<p>Tolstoy said: "For the sake of love, one should live for others." Yes, living for oneself is for the satisfaction of love, but what is it for if life is only for consuming some boring moments? I want to ask, what is it for?</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong, no black or white, this is the world. The flood of desires, the struggle for profit, this is society. I will also light a cigarette, whistle a cheerful tune, and pretend to be happy, but to vent my anger in leisure, it will only add more sorrow.</p>
<p>Only thinking is free, but because of this, I am even more afraid to think. The silent thoughts are like venomous snakes, pouring bitter sweat into life. Blessed people, close your thoughts!</p>
<p>Anger is like a spark, even if it is suppressed, it is still burning and brewing a greater brilliance. Is that so, truth is eternal—it is eternal, I wish it eternal, for its sake, I have restrained my anger, we must live and fight bravely.</p>
<h3>Candlelight</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dun</p>
<p>Candlelight, burning itself, giving light to the world.</p>
<p>The lamp went out. I drew back the sky-blue curtain, gazing at the starry sky, quietly indulging in thoughts. How many times on nights like this, I have transformed all my beautiful ideals and hopes into silver stars! Scattered across the sky, letting my faith face the starry sky, always so firm, so devout!</p>
<p>"Use your fingertips to caress the stars in the sky!" This symbolizes the lofty ideals of all scientists, philosophers, and poets! And us people, people born on the earth, looking up, yearning for the starry sky, allowing all those struggling in pain to obtain immortal faith and infinite hope! To obtain amazing discoveries and inventions, and endless creations and creations.</p>
<p>Facing the starry sky is human instinct and will, and man, man on the earth, his destiny is forever a shining candle, burning himself, to pursue that immortal light. May we be like a star in the sky! Because, in the world, that candlelight is just the final ashes!</p>
<p>A candlelight, when it is bright, tears through a piece of darkness! When countless candlelights are lit, even on a cold night, it is warm! Be a candlelight, and all those who are struggling in the darkness, burning their youth, their lives, the torment of blood and tears, not only warms yourself, but also warms countless people. Not only illuminating your own heart, but also illuminating countless pure souls.</p>
<p>Everyone is like a candlelight, emitting warmth, emitting light! Everyone wants to be a star, and everyone, in the world, will also be an eternal star</p>
<p>I pulled up the sky-blue curtain. Every friend I miss is like a bright star, shining in my heart! I lit a candle, and on this long winter night, I wrote poems to bless them! My life is burning because of countless people...</p>
<p>The golden candlelight reflects the crystal tears, which is the suffering of heaven, but also endless joy!</p>
<p>I am burning myself, I am giving light to the world!</p>
<h3>Centipedes and Others</h3>
<p>— Meng Nong</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The poet Lu Fangweng said, "To learn poetry, one should look beyond poetry." This is a valuable piece of advice based on experience. By extension, to learn how to write, one should also strive to learn from outside the realm of writing.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle, one can also understand why many teachers are not necessarily writers, and why many grammar experts are not necessarily great literary masters. One can also understand why modern writers advocate reading beyond the confines of books, and why they do not encourage young people to read novels and other similar books as a shortcut to writing.</p>
<p>There is no shortcut to any learning. The only way is to start walking, step by step, continuously. Even if there is no path at the beginning, as long as one keeps walking, one can still forge one's own path.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The British zoologist Lankester was a scientist who was deeply thoughtful and skilled in observation. He once cleverly cited a fable to illustrate that a centipede is a multi-legged animal that can walk, but it doesn't know how to walk at all. However, this does not affect its ability to walk. There is a poem to prove it:</p>
<p>A centipede went out for a leisurely stroll,</p>
<p>When a toad jokingly asked him:</p>
<p>"Please tell me, which leg goes first? Which leg goes last?"</p>
<p>This question brought all sorts of doubts to the centipede's mind,</p>
<p>Until later, exhausted, exhausted, it fell into the gutter, still not knowing how to start walking.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The centipede's doubts are obstacles and stumbling blocks on its journey. Once it falls into the gutter, it becomes a laughing stock for the toads.</p>
<p>Old scholars tell young students that to write well, one must cite the classics. New literary talents teach young people that to write well, one must study logic or dialectics. In reality, if you listen to the former, you will at most only be able to cite classics, but your writing may not necessarily be "beautiful and impressive." If you listen to the latter, your consciousness may be correct, but your writing will always be full of slogans, which are dead things rather than living works. In fact, there is no difference.</p>
<p>Such "writers," apart from falling into traps or new gutters, seem unlikely to find another way.</p>
<h3>Inscription for Daqian's Scroll Painting of Sichuan Mountains and Qin Trees for Muhann</h3>
<p>— Xie Wuliang</p>
<p>My brother Muhann traveled north the year before last, taking in the sights of Jianmen Pass. Daqian painted the mountains and rivers he passed through. Many famous figures wrote poems for it. I have been asked to write an inscription many times, but have not yet done so. In recent days, I have been delighted to hear the news of the defeat of the fierce enemies. I am even more mindful of the difficulty of Muhann's grand tour before this. I write this song in haste to send to him, hoping for his correction. Fifth day after the Autumn Equinox, Year of Yiyou.</p>
<p>Master Zhang stands tall at eight feet,</p>
<p>With bright pupils and a broad forehead, not ordinary.</p>
<p>Although he assists among hundreds of officials,</p>
<p>His ambition is always to soar to the clouds.</p>
<p>When the fierce bandits suddenly invaded from the east,</p>
<p>Thousands of riders patrolled the west.</p>
<p>The temporary capital was grandly established,</p>
<p>Making Sichuan shine.</p>
<p>Supporting each other, they rushed to help.</p>
<p>How could Master Zhang refuse to serve?</p>
<p>Yet because of official duties and limited salary,</p>
<p>He freely visited the mountains and rivers:</p>
<p>He explored Yu's Cave, gazing at the vastness,</p>
<p>The spring grass fragrant beside Kuerping.</p>
<p>Qingcheng is secluded, like a sky-high barn,</p>
<p>Emei's peaks soar high, summer frost flies.</p>
<p>He only heard the Buddhist and Daoist masters open the altar,</p>
<p>Raising his head, he couldn't help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>From ancient times, setting up defenses was the way to govern the country,</p>
<p>Relying on the northern route to connect Yong and Liang.</p>
<p>After the Qin army entered, the Five Strong Men fell,</p>
<p>Protecting the country originally relied on good planning.</p>
<p>Curious and nostalgic, he could not forget,</p>
<p>The Jianmen Pass plank road clings to the cliffs.</p>
<p>He also invited worthy companions Huang and Zhang,</p>
<p>(Referring to Junbi and Daqian)</p>
<p>By land and water, they advanced together, observing yin and yang.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the Han and Tang dynasties are countless,</p>
<p>The Thousand Buddha Passage is magnificent.</p>
<p>The traces of the flying immortals have disappeared.</p>
<p>The bottom of Mingyue Gorge is cool and clear.</p>
<p>Chaotian Post Ridge is connected to the Qiang people,</p>
<p>The shape of the mountains and the flow of the water rise and fall together.</p>
<p>Creek villages hide under false names,</p>
<p>The old danger of Qipan Pass has been lost.</p>
<p>Riding in the same carriage, drinking wine, happy and unrestrained,</p>
<p>The night rain in Wulian rustles.</p>
<p>Wu Daozi once painted the Jialing River,</p>
<p>Daqian's paintings are inspired and fly high.</p>
<p>Now the whole world sees that we have recovered,</p>
<p>Master Zhang hurriedly prepared to return south.</p>
<p>He smiles at the painting, putting away his official duties.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 184</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>People who have not done intelligence work generally have two kinds of mentality towards intelligence operations. One mentality believes that this kind of work is extremely mysterious, so they are inevitably surprised and astonished by the effectiveness of this kind of work, and regard the people who do this kind of work as swordsmen and heroes who come and go without a trace. The other kind of mentality thinks that this kind of work is not worth mentioning, but some conspirators secretly make plans, take advantage of people's unpreparedness, and take ruthless measures. So they think it is just the tricks of demons and ghosts in the dark.</p>
<p>However, these two kinds of views are just the words of laymen, not scratching the itch. They don't know that intelligence operations are like evenly matched opponents. They also need to plan carefully in advance, need proper command, need sophisticated equipment, and need officers and soldiers to do their best and strive for the lead. And the especially difficult point is that intelligence is different from military affairs, because there are many operations that are carried out by individuals alone. Therefore, if the members are complex, lack loyalty, lack faith, are poorly trained, and are of poor quality, it often happens that the entire army is wiped out because of the dereliction of duty of one person.</p>
<p>Since I met Mr. W, I have seen him handle several important operations with my own eyes, and I think he is a genius: not only in intelligence. If you ask him to use the energy and wisdom he used in intelligence work in military affairs, he will definitely become a famous general; if he uses it in politics, he will definitely be a first-class politician; if he uses it in science, he will definitely be an inventor or an explorer of new theories; if he uses it in business or industry, he will definitely be a leading expert.</p>
<p>At a little after eight o'clock, I and Hucheng went upstairs to Mr. W's office and met him busy giving orders. There were a dozen people standing in the room, and one or two were sitting. It turned out that he was arranging the assault work at this time, assigning groups, and issuing instructions.</p>
<p>Most of the dozen or so comrades who were standing quietly were around 30 years old, and there were also one or two university students in their twenties, and two or three people from the professional world in their forties. But everyone was full of energy and calm.</p>
<p>Mr. W's organization has one peculiar feature. It seems that there is no distinction between the core members and the supporting actors, just like the organization of a Kunqu opera troupe. Whoever takes turns to be the protagonist is the protagonist. When it's not their turn to be the protagonist, they also play supporting roles, and they also play the big gong on the stage. It seems to have a sense of equality. However, there are also different levels, but the standards for ranking levels are not only based on qualifications, but mostly based on the performance during training, the efficiency during the trial period, and the merits during formal service, rising or falling. The salary is completely in accordance with the military treatment. Although the treatment of higher and lower levels is slightly different, on the whole, everyone can only get a little meager living expenses.</p>
<p>Because I have been living here recently and have more contact with him, I know a lot about Mr. W's subordinates. At this time, among these dozen or so comrades, there was a strong man in his forties who used to be a police officer in Beiping and was most familiar with the Beiping area. His duties tonight were all arranged by him, and even the highest-ranking officer in charge of the operation had to listen to his orders.</p>
<p>When we entered the room, Mr. W just nodded slightly as a greeting, and then continued to give orders. His voice was not loud, but his pronunciation was accurate and his sentences were concise and powerful. An order was only issued once. If the person receiving the order had any vague points when repeating it, Mr. W would definitely repeat the order again. As long as you listen quietly by the side, you will know that Mr. W really has great talent. His pronunciation is clear, and his thinking is quick and systematic. Just this one small assault command, but listening from the side, you can also feel that it is complex and chaotic, with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands. However, he was able to unravel the threads and keep everything in order, which proves that he is truly meticulous.</p>
<h3>Reading "San Mao Joins the Army"</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the progress of cartoons was obvious to us. In today's world where illiteracy prevails, a good cartoon is far more functional than a profound and pungent essay. However, with the instability of the social environment and the reduction or contraction of publications, our opportunities to read cartoons have also decreased. - Not to mention the magazines that specialized in war cartoons before the War of Resistance Against Japan that we cannot see today, even the cartoons published as inserts in color versions, how many magazines can we see them in today? Continuous cartoons such as Ye Qianyu's "Mr. Wang", Zhang Leping's "San Mao", and Huang Xiao's "Bull Nose" are even more...</p>
<p>However, not long ago we finally saw Zhang Leping's "San Mao Joins the Army" in this newspaper again, which is really a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>"San Mao was a figure from ten years ago. In theory, after ten years, he should have grown into a talented person, but I am still drawing San Mao now, and drawing the old San Mao, because I feel that San Mao's living environment has not changed at all in the past ten years. Ten years ago, San Mao picked up garbage and slept on the road. Ten years later, San Mao has still not improved. The only slight difference in spirit is that ten years later, San Mao learned to be like an adult, doing business on the road, smoking American cigarette butts, and shouting 'Hi! Joe!'. Since San Mao has so many problems, I feel that I can't finish drawing him and can't finish writing about him."</p>
<p>The author said this in the "Preface" in the first volume after compiling his military notes "into a book".</p>
<p>"No change in ten years", is this San Mao's misfortune? Or the author's cruelty? Or is it the sorrow of those of us who are alive?</p>
<p>The content of the first volume of "San Mao Joins the Army" does not need my introduction, because it has already been published in this newspaper. I am a layman when it comes to cartoons, so of course I can't talk about the technical advantages. What I can report is that a volume I had has been taken away by my little daughter who is just in the first grade of elementary school, and has become a treasure to brag about to her friends. There is no explanation in the picture, but she can still draw it in a methodical way.</p>
<p>My opinion is that I think San Mao can retire from the army. The pain of war is already too much for us to bear. Regardless of whether San Mao has grown into a talented person or not, let him put down his gun first. Although he may still return to the life of "picking up garbage and sleeping on the road", the most important thing is to put down the gun in his hand now so that he doesn't have to "pick up garbage" and doesn't have to "sleep on the road"!</p>

<h3>"For the Record"</h3>
<p>— Ye Heng</p>
<p>Application for "Production Loan" Retrospective</p>
<p>Last year, I and several friends operated a small factory. At the end of the year, we saw the news in the newspaper that the authorities had specially lent 2 billion in "production loans" to help the struggling industries and businesses in Shanghai. At the same time, our factory was being troubled by high interest rates, so we were overjoyed and rushed to the Joint Savings Society to inquire about the loan procedures.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is the end of the year for every merchant. If this business cannot settle all its debts at this time, then it may be stranded. It was precisely because of this reason that we regarded obtaining this "production loan" as the fate of our factory, and I was specially appointed to be responsible for applying for the loan.</p>
<p>The first time: I stepped into the grand hall of the Bank of China and found Room "2118" on the second floor. It was already crowded with people. Everyone had a hopeful heart, the same anxious face, and was inquiring about the form-filling, investigation, mortgage, and deadline issues that they urgently wanted to know from the reception staff. I stood quietly by the side, not wanting to ask questions, and at the same time it was difficult to interrupt to ask questions, so I withdrew like this.</p>
<p>The second time: I chose a time close to the break and went straight to their office, took out the business card of our factory, and sincerely and humbly asked for all the points I wanted to know. The result: the forms had not yet been printed, and I had to wait for three days. I ran out of the Bank of China's grand hall in disappointment. Three days later, I got up especially early and rushed to the front of everyone who wanted to get the form. In the state of being crowded, though not in a line, I was lucky enough to get a set of forms. I treasured them and carefully returned to our factory - this was the third time.</p>
<p>After several people repeatedly deliberated and filled out the application, compiled the factory's balance sheet, listed the inventory of pledges, and wrote a letter of request for a loan with earnest words, I went to Room "218" for the fourth time. Several people's faces were too familiar; because they and I were pursuing the same goal, it can be said that their joys and sorrows were consistent; I handed the completed form to a staff member, who glanced at it lightly and said, "15 million!" I took it and said, "Yes! We are small businesses." He pointed to the mailing office, and I understood and solemnly sent it to the mailing office and took back the receipt.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that after accepting the application, someone would come to investigate within a week, and the loan could be received after ten days. We summoned all 20 workers and explained that if someone came to investigate, your spirits should be invigorated, the factory should be tidy and clean, which can prove that our factory is not big, but it is very orderly and also very hopeful. After waiting until the sixth day, which was only two days before the end of the year, the day when the workers asked for a rest, the investigator came. We hurriedly checked the account books, raw materials, and inventory one by one, and offered cigarettes and tea, hoping for the success of the loan.</p>
<p>The next day: Another investigator from an agency came and asked for this and that in the same way. We skillfully complied, and as a result, he also left as if he had gained something. The day after that was New Year's Eve, and I couldn't help but run to the Joint Savings Society to inquire whether our loan would be approved? When will it be available next year at the earliest? A simple answer was that they didn't know either, so I counted it as my fifth trip.</p>
<p>After the New Year, I made my sixth trip on the fourth day of the new year, and ran into Room "218", which had already been completely changed. It turned out that the "production loan" had ended. I heard that only 20 of the thousands of applications investigated last time had been approved. Then, we, and the small loans like us, I'm afraid there will be no hope. But, just in case, the committee members of the review committee happen to be in a "good mood", maybe there is still hope. I left the office in a daze and met the people who came to apply together last year in the corridor.</p>
<p>The second month of the lunar calendar has already begun, and the "production loan" seems to have disappeared without a trace. With a desperate heart, I still reluctantly recalled the six trips to the "Bank of China".</p>
<p>This is the general process of our application for the "production loan". Now, although the "production loan" has become an ear-piercing term in the golden tide, I am always willing to record the process of our application as above for the record.</p>
<h3>Fish that Escaped the Net</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jie</p>
<p>Why Isn't Li Xianglan Extradited?</p>
<p>According to a faithful report from a Chinese reporter stationed in Tokyo, Li Xianglan (Japanese name: Yamaguchi Yoshiko), a Japanese female spy who was once active in Shanghai and Northeast China under MacArthur's control, has reappeared on the streets of Tokyo, and is relying on her beauty to enter and exit social venues, becoming very familiar with the officials. Her activities in Tokyo are even better than her actions in China in the past. In order to protect our country, this female spy Li Xianglan, who once helped the enemy kill our compatriots, should be immediately extradited back to China. Otherwise, letting this fish that escaped the net roam freely overseas will cause a great disturbance in the future.</p>
<h3>More on Tiger Hunting</h3>
<p>— Ma Jin</p>
<p>Recalling that the XX regiment of the XX Day travelled east and west, busily travelling among the major cities in the recovered areas, at that time it made a bold statement: "We should hunt more tigers and swat fewer flies." How long has it been? The words are still there, but the facts are completely different.</p>
<p>With a grand and majestic momentum, in the end, it is inevitable that the flags will be lowered and the drums will be silenced, which is embarrassing. It is appropriate that the tiger's power is increasingly shaking in China, and those flies can also buzz in the world.</p>
<p>Extending this further, there is this gold rush.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Inspection and Supervision Group of the Relief Agency, at the group's meeting, spoke frankly and earnestly: "We must have the determination to hunt tigers and strike at those who manipulate the financial situation." The victims who feel disgusted by this are really praying for good fortune.</p>
<p>But to hunt tigers, we must strike at their key points. If the tiger is killed, the flies will surrender without being swatted. This is also the principle of catching the bandits, first catch the king. Unfortunately, according to reports, the authorities seem to still be busy catching two or three small flies on the road to make a snack. The so-called tiger hunting will probably end up scaring the snake and hesitating to kill the rat.</p>
<p>However, we common people are waiting to see the magical powers of the tiger-hunting generals.</p>
<h3>The Wild Crane Has No Food, But The World is Wide - One Bird Series, Three</h3>
<p>— Zhuguang</p>
<p>There are less than twenty bird shops in Shanghai, most of which are located at the corner of Five Horse Road and Zhejiang Road. Generally speaking, the shops are very small, so they seem even more messy. In addition, the sound of birds is noisy. If you are not a true bird lover, you would not dare to come in just because of these things.</p>
<p>Bird shops, in addition to their names and selling birds, also sell birdcages and food containers. It is said that birdcages are also very particular. The most common are bamboo cages, each ranging from thousands of yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. More sophisticated ones are made of rosewood, and even more lavish ones have colored jade stones inlaid on the rosewood cages. In addition, for business convenience, they also sell other animals, such as rabbits, squirrels, toads, and洋鼠 (commonly known as "洋老蟲" -- foreign mice).</p>
<p>The customers who visit these bird shops every day are not the ones who come to buy birds or cages, but the ones who come to buy bird food. Speaking of bird food, the most common are millet, grain, wheat, and rapeseed. In addition, there are also the so-called "皮蟲" (bark worms) and "桑蟲" (mulberry worms), which are worms on the bark of trees that are used as food, saying that they have a "nourishing" effect, just like humans taking cod liver oil.</p>
<p>This elegant industry is now truly at the end of its road. Right now, there are no birds coming from outside at all. Not to mention Southeast Asia and foreign countries, even the goods coming from Changzhou, Yangzhou, and the Hangzhou and Shaoxing areas of Zhejiang are scarce recently, so it is difficult to get goods.</p>
<p>In the past, old masters played with birds for entertainment. Now, it is completely different. People can't even get enough to eat, so where do they get the free money to raise birds? Those people who carry birdcages to tea parties and bird fairs, although they seem leisurely, who knows if they are unemployed people with no work? Who knows if they are full of worries? Therefore, business is cold and clear due to weak purchasing power.</p>
<p>The less than twenty bird shops are eking out a living in this situation of being at the end of the road. No wonder a young shop assistant said: "Once birds are locked in cages, they will never be free. In fact, aren't we the same in this society? -- They are not even as good as them, being fed by someone!"</p>
<p>I understand the meaning of these words, but I dare not agree with his last sentence. The difference between humans and animals lies in this, doesn't it? As the saying goes:</p>
<p>"Caged cranes have food and soup nearby, but wild cranes have no food, yet the world is wide!"</p>
<h3>Xi Feng's Burnt "Juanzi"</h3>
<p>— Zhuguang</p>
<p>Burnt "Juanzi" is too unappetizing. Don't blame the poor quality of the flour; blame your wife for lacking managerial experience and culinary skills. Now, the only remedy is to re-blend the flour, scrub the pot, and try a second time.</p>
<p>Xi Feng, nicknamed "Spicy Goods," is eloquent and used to telling witty remarks. Every time she speaks, it is either grotesque and funny or full of wit and humor, making people jealous and loved. Every time I read "Dream of the Red Chamber," I like to read the tone of this humorous beauty the most. A cascade of jokes is vividly active between the lines, making people reluctant to put it down.</p>
<p>"We are a pair of burnt "Juanzi," I am only fit to mess around with him (referring to Jia Lian)." This is Xi Feng's self-deprecating remark to someone on one occasion. The explanation of the tone is nothing more than that burnt "Juanzi" is not made of good material. Buying such a useless person only means she is fit to mess around with him.</p>
<p>The more humble and self-deprecating Xi Feng is, the more she shows off her affected manners, acting coquettishly and foolishly, vividly portraying a beauty with a clever and witty tongue. The burnt "Juanzi," after being spoken by this humorous beauty, and with the addition of Cao Xueqin's brilliant writing, is not a useless thing at all; it has simply become a light and delicious fragrant snack!</p>
<p>Now, when we are holding a piece of burnt "Juanzi" that is difficult to swallow, and look around at the domestic situation, today, after victory, the country's situation should be like a freshly steamed bun, thriving. However, industry and commerce are suffering from recession, the economy is in distress, everything is expensive, and inflation and business closures have become a widespread and prevalent cholera. The sight is a mess, and it cannot be cleaned up. This situation is not like a fragrant steamed bun at all; it is simply no different from a piece of burnt "Juanzi."</p>
<p>The "Juanzi" has already been "burnt." How can we re-blend the flour and try again? (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>— Bei Tian</p>
<p>Respectfully to the City Council</p>
<p>(I) The city's cinemas have recently raised prices without authorization, violating regulations, affecting the entertainment of the common people. The Social Affairs Bureau turns a blind eye. Why doesn't the City Council stop it?</p>
<p>(II) In order to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff, municipal schools collect academic advancement subsidies, which are clearly a disguised form of teacher appreciation money, going against the City Council's resolutions and increasing the burden on citizens. The Education Bureau actually approved it. Why doesn't the City Council stop it?</p>
<p>Respectfully awaiting the City Council's reply.</p>
<h3>Thoughts Can Maintain Youth (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated from Study</p>
<p>No matter what age you are, the fear of aging often attacks you at any time and place. Because I am a consulting psychologist specializing in the study of age-related issues, I have found that among my many clients, most of them are ladies around thirty years old. They are truly troubled by the increasing age and want to learn methods to avoid aging. Therefore, I am telling them here that if you are between seventeen and seventy years old and feel interested in maintaining youth, please read on slowly, perhaps it will be of some benefit to you.</p>
<p>Before I tell you the methods, it is best to explain a few theories first:</p>
<p>First, age cannot be calculated by years, because the time expressed physiologically by humans often does not match the time on the clock. The physiological aging phenomenon of humans slows down with increasing age. That is to say, the older you are, the slower your age becomes, and the slower you get old. In fact, from thirty to forty years old, your physiological changes are always slower than your physiological changes from twenty-five to thirty years old, and from fifty-five to seventy years old, it is even slower than from forty to fifty-five years old.</p>
<p>Another reason why the calendar cannot represent the true age of humans is that the rate of aging of various tissues in the human body is also different. Generally speaking, human vision is fully developed in the teens, hearing is fully developed in the twenties, and by the thirties, muscles, physical strength, reproductive power, and metabolism in the body all develop to their peak. But at the same time, your mind, even at fifty years old, is still young and continues to grow. As for human brainpower, it takes another ten years to fully develop. The efficiency of the brain only gradually declines from the age of sixty, and by the age of eighty, your intelligence is still the same as it was at thirty, and a new kind of thinking power is produced. Although the memory of the elderly fades, their thinking power is not restricted. On the contrary, the older they are, the richer their knowledge, the farther their vision, and the more accurate and abundant their judgment and reason. These past experiences can help us solve difficult problems. In short, we have gained wisdom. This tells you why those old doctors, experienced lawyers, and experienced craftsmen can still compete with those young and strong youngsters.</p>
