<h3>我官方人士舉具體事實　譴責菲排華政策　反覆無常致使談判停頓</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕中央社記者頃就目前中國與菲律賓之關係，菲國會排華措施，及最近中菲談判停頓事，詢問我官方人士渠等一致對近來菲政府之排華態度引為遺憾。</p>
<p>華僑　貢獻　極大</p>
<p>官方人士接見記者時咸稱菲政府之排華，政策並無正當理由，謂數十年來旅菲華僑之努力，對菲律賓羣島之發展與繁榮已有極大之貢獻，在日寇佔領期間，不但菲境僑胞之生命財產曾遭受絕大損失，且有不少華僑參加菲洲繋隊並肩作戰，對於菲律賓之解放，及盟國共同之勝利，曾作相當這犧牲與貢獻，中國人民對菲律賓共和國之誕生，及完全獨立之取得，感覺誠摯之欣慰，熱望此新邦之誕生即將增進中菲兩國人民間之友誼，然此希望之實現，似已因菲政府之態度而遲滯矣</p>
<p>受害　者唯　華僑</p>
<p>記者繼詢及菲政府排華政策之具體事實，獲悉下列諸端：（一）菲國會提案中之勞工菲化案，强迫華僑僱用菲人在全體雇員中佔百分之六十，（二）菲國會提案中之零售商菲化案，將使華僑零售商無法生存，（三）中國移民入菲之限額，原已過低，現復有减去原數十分之九之計劃。最後尚有菲國會所通過之攤販菲化案，將奪取全部華僑攤販之攤位以予菲人，此法案之實施，僅因華僑於馬尼剌地方法院提出控告而暫告停頓，官方人士曾主泚申諭，謂允許攤位之設立或拒絕，與自數千華僑手中奪取其久已經營之攤位實不相同，蓋華僑攤位之設立，已有久遠之歷史，慘淡經營，規模始具，多數華僑之生活，唯此是賴。該法案之成立，實將剝奪華僑生存之權利，在名義上該法案雖適用於一般外人，然實受其害者，則唯華僑而已，此種歧視損害中菲兩國之利益，吾人所應注意者，即在菲島尚未獨立之前，此項法案固未嘗存在也。</p>
<p>不瞭　解菲　態度</p>
<p>關於中菲談判之停頓，官方人士謂，中國政府不能瞭解菲政府何以採取此種態度，該項條約之談判，已達可以簽字之階段，然菲政府竟出人意外，將已同意之各要點　然加以推翻，且提出與原案無關而矛盾之提案，條約在未正式簽字前，固可略加修改，但自外交訂約之慣例言之，參業經雙方同意之條款，如無充分理由，不得提議推翻，否則今日同意，明日推翻，反覆無常，不特談判不能成功，且適足使對方難堪而已，官方人士認為此種行動，與菲政府希望促進中菲邦交之聲明不相符合，但中國政府仍股望菲政府能以事實證明其善意，俾旅菲華僑之合法權益有所保障，而中菲訂約之談判亦可順利完成。</p>
<p>菲閣　討論　覆文</p>
<p>〔中央社馬呢剌廿二日電〕此間菲官方消息稱：菲政府對我駐菲公使陳質平第一次照會之　文，將可能於本日送交人公使館，據稱：復文曾於昨日內閣會議中討論，內閣會議予以完全支持，復文內容雖未宣佈，但一般相信，將與菲副總統兼外長季里諾兩日前向報界發表之聲明所取之立塲一致。</p>

<h3>承德發生離奇慘殺案　省衛生處長因侵佔傅說懐恨　槍擊副處長要友後刎頸身死</h3>
<p>〔中央社承德廿二日電〕此間週前發生一慘殺案，熱省衛生處長戴鴻福刎頸身死，副處長裘冲周被槍擊傷，並有工友張某被擊傷重斃命。各方對事件之發生眾說紛紜，據可靠方面消息：戴氏安東人，出身齊魯醫大，抗戰中任滇緬公路衛生站長，勝利後改任現職，客臘忽有戴氏侵占行總撥發醫藥品之謠傳，事為劉主席所聞，面詢戴氏眞象，羹飭其注意所屬人員之操守；戴自此不愉，因夙與副處長裘冲周及醫士王某失和，遂疑出裘王之暗傷，自此怕悴失常，六日晚由地政局長王長　處假得手槍一支，歸後邀裘面議公務，待裘入室，即出槍射擊，彈中面頰仆地，適工友張某聞聲往觀，戴復於院內運發五槍，傷及張之腹部，戴返室而裘則逾窗逃出。及省府與地方當局聞訊往視，戴已倒地身死，傷在頸項，長二寸，深達寸餘，旁有刮臉刀一把，血流盈地，其狀極慘，據裘云：戴因睹渠未死，復持刀迫殺，伊當時精神昏亂，故不悉其何以致死，便裘之手心有刀傷橫貫，而經檢察官相騐，戴氏傷痕狀况又不類自刎，故有人疑為裘奪刀自衛因而將戴殺死，裘現已赴平就醫，案移承德地檢處偵查中，眞相如何，尚難預測。</p>

<h3>「經濟緊急措施方案」補遺</h3>
<p>— 駱清華</p>
<p>如何利導黑巿游資　積極扶植生產事業</p>
<p>由於黃金風潮掀起之物價暴漲，經濟騷動，經過中樞當局之不斷集議，終於在本月十六日，由國防最高委員會，制定經濟緊急措施方案，經國民政府明令公佈施行。方案內容，各方兼顧，確能針對現實，經濟病態，一掃歷來頭痛醫頭之積習，不失為順應與情的緊急措施。惟其為緊急措施，因之不免偏重於治標辦法。其精義所在，可以「加强秋制，緊縮信用」兩語包括之。按物價之成為問題，不外乎（一）物資缺，（二）鈔票多，兩種因素。針對病因的治療方法，就須要管制和緊縮，這是無可非議的。但如意外的經濟援助沒有希望，那末，僅　管制，還是不能持久的。統　整個方案，對於如何積極的扶植農工生產，以增加物源一點，未被强調規定，而欲掌握物資，推廣輸出，恐未必能如理想一樣的簡單。因此究竟能否就此穩定幣値，以至平衡預算，亦殊値得研究，再就緊縮信用言，「管制金融業務辦法」，僅僅控制國家行局，與正當行莊的業務，而對於最基本最龐大的黑巿游資，並未明白指出如何取締或利導。雖然對於以鎭壓物價為中心的所應採取的一切步驟，如取締投機，禁止買賣黃金，禁止外匯流通，控制物價及工資，供應民生日用物品，與管制金融業務，修正外匯管理等等，似均已一一制定辦法，綱舉目張，盡傷盡美，但這一切不過是同時並發的經濟病態，而尚非致病的癥結所在。當抗戰中期，太平洋事變發生時起，即已游離正當金融機關，嗣後與日俱增的大量黑巿資金，實為吾國多年來「經濟之癌」。任何經濟巿塲的騷動不安，莫不由於「游資作崇」。但至今不曾有過阻過或利導的妥善辦法，而絕非「管理銀行辦法」，或「秋制金融業務辦法」所能收效的。此次緊急措施方案，對於此恒河沙數之黑巿游資，仍未有如何使之獲得歸宿的方法，而况增製游資的發行工具，尚未憂然停止。黑巿資金惡勢力的熾張，已遠過抗戰時期。病根不除，我們不得不惶慮一切管制物價方案能否收對症發　的預期效果。再者，同樣的經濟病態，而病理因素，與時間環境，均與抗戰時期間顯有出入，若仍還用遠在兩年以至八年以前的「取締限價條例」，與「非常時期　礦工商條例，」在當時不甚靈騐的陳方舊藥，到今日能否藥到病除，亦殊値得深思。</p>
<p>笨者，始終以為經濟問題，只能以經濟措施謀求解決，政治壓力僅能偶而相輔運用以補偏救弊的。尤以吾國組織不如人，管制機關本身的人事，訓練，操守，技能，並無確切聯營把握，貿然執行業務，自難期其推行盡利。在抗戰過程中，曾有多少人憧憬於英蘇的管制分配政策，認為吾國亦何難迎頭趕上，但試行結果，什九不能滿意。甚至執行管制最力的省巿，其所受失敗之敎訓亦最甚。經過長時期之鄭重攷騐，直至卅二年始翻然變計，改由各同業公會議價，受政府之督導，其結果，成績尚比較差强人意。往鑒不遠，歷歷在目。度思當時以「抗戰第一，國家至上」號召之下，內有總動員法足資運用，外有戰區封鎖綫為之範籌，尚不能收管制之預期效果，而今環境時間迥異往昔，海口四通，人慾橫流，政治紀律與商業道德，同顏破產。倘欲施行高度管制，殆不俟嘗試，即可預測其後果。况戰時物價上漲原因，由於四境封鎖過久，物資日益乏絕，供需失調之關係居多，至於目前，則大多數日用物品並不感覺缺少而各地購買力反一致低落，年內廠店倒風，與開正之紅　趨跌，均充分證明普遍不景氣之現狀。論理至少在當前不應有嚴重的物價問題。徒由於二月六日，宣布出口津貼進口附加辦法之時，事前破例不作準備，事後拋售黃金之數量與價格又均不免措置失當，以致金鈔陡漲，刺激物價，掀起軒然大波，創抗戰十年來之新紀錄。吾人認為此一瘋狂漲風，實為不應發生之突發事件。工商業在發生惶懼心理之下，一時或不免有隨波逐浪之舉，但大率有行無巿，成交極少。觀於開春以來，內地匯出匯款之稀少，足見實銷之不起。此次漲風，從不加以鎭壓，亦即將回跌。至今後即遇物價再漲，亦必以發行增加「游資作崇」為主要原因。此與戰時不同的情形，千萬不可忽視。任何治標治本的方案，均應以轉移黑巿游資投放生產建設，為不二法門。王雲五部長，曾謂「上海工界有種矛盾，一方面係資金短絀，請求政府辦理工貸商貸，一方面係游資充斥，競相投機於黃金買賣」，此誠為實際情形。但並非為工商業者，右興辦實業，向政府告貸，左手游資充斥從事投機這謂。蓋戰後經濟巿塲，已劃分為兩在陣營，一方為正當工商業，抗戰期間，艱苦自持，勝利以來，仍堅守崗位，在高利貸，高工資，虛盈實稅之下，依然資金短絀，告貸無門。一方多為新興　富，購黃金，玩美鈔，辦貼放，盤高利，套購公債證券，投機　斷，無所不為，而絕不經營生產事業。亦如前者之極鮮餘力兼顧投機。自來投機資本，興風作浪，搗亂巿面，實為正當工商業之　賊，而與官僚資本，則當相呼應，若即若離，狼狽為奸。衡情酌理，正當工商業與依法設立之行莊，應受政府之維護，而投機資本與官僚之資本，當受國法之制裁。但事實往往適得其反。黑巿資金，無須繳存準備金，無須完納任何稅捐，亦無勞資糾紛，政府雖制定種種法律，但投機家不須有顯著之店號與合法之帳册，規避取巧，每為法令所不及。查本年一月份上海各行莊存款準備金總數為三百四死後億，可知全巿各行莊存款不過二千餘億元，而同時行莊以外之黑巿資金，究為多少，無從統計。僅照去冬倒閉廠店對外帳務估計，（每見報載，倒閉廠店之債務，國家行局與行莊放款。合計不過佔十之一二，其餘十之八九為黑巿高利貸。）黑巿資金僅貼放一項，即應占當地存款之八九倍。若將本身投機於金鈔債劵囤貨等合併估計，則十數倍於滬巿存款總額，即二萬億以上之黑巿游資，當不為過。國家控制行莊信用，無微不至，而十倍於行莊存款之黑巿游資，則無法加以控制，僑其泛瀾奔放—欲求經濟政策之普遍貫澈，經濟巿塲之納入正軌，不亦難哉！</p>
<p>抗戰以來，多少管制辦法，往往囫圇吞棗，友敵不分，以至玉石俱焚，甚或投機集團未嘗刺傷毫髪，而有意無意之間，正當工商金融事業，反受到嚴重的迫害，無異為　騙省，使游資日益游離投向黑巿。例如非金融機關收受存款，本于例禁，但現行「管理銀行辦法」，對於行莊違法，逐條訂有罰則，而亽黑巿存放，迄無取締辦法。此次緊急措施方案，「管制金融業務辦法」對於商業行莊，省巿銀行，均有極嚴厲之規定，雖國家行局亦未倖免，獨於黑巿資金，隻字未予提及，不能謂非重大之掛誤。竊以黑巿游資作崇，為一切經濟措施之最大障碍，旣為多年來盡人皆知之鐵的事實，致府必須針對現實，另定法案，加以嚴厲這取締，從而因勞利導，使游資轉入正當金融機關，投放生產事業，實為當今亟要之圖。一面政府對於正當行莊，必須於管制以外，加以積極的輔導，使能有配合經濟國策，完成任務之力量。至國家行局，旣各負有專業責任，協助農工生產，推廣輸出貿易，對於行局之資金運用，尤不宜限制過嚴。吾人體認「管制金融業務辦法」，似偽重於緊縮受政府管制擾亂巿塲的黑巿資金，不應一面放任黑巿，一反專以正當行莊為嚴格管制的對象。至於國家行局，同秉國策，更應與中央銀行站在同一立塲，分工合作，協同控制黑巿，利導游資，扶植生產事業，達成經濟措施的全部方案。（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<h3>印度政局將臨新階段　英推動印緬聯防　蒙巴頓將試探印當局對防務意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕英國決定至遲於一九四八年六月以前退州印度後，緬甸之局勢益增重要。據消息靈通人士稱：緬甸英國軍界意欲組織將來印度之防務，他日緬甸成為獨立國後，英國擬與之締結軍事協定，規定緬何軍中之全部軍官與下級官佐，均由英國人充任，俾在緬甸軍隊中擴大一批幹練人員，其中一部份於緊急時期將派往支持印度之防務，同時又不削弱緬甸之軍隊。此種措施所引起之過份支出，當由英國担任，而不支緬向國庫。依照此一計劃，印度當有軍隊常駐西北與東北邊境各易受攻擊之地點，一日遭遇侵略時，該項部隊首當其衛，而支持相當時間，以待緬甸方面英國軍官趕到，担任其他印度部隊之指揮。印度辛特省之略拉嗤港，應完全租與英國，新任印督藏巴頓之重大任務，在與印度當局就此一問題成立協議。蒙帥物色邱吉爾戰時內閣之軍事顧問伊斯梅上將為參謀人員，伊氏之使命，殆在試探印度當局對於防務問題之意見。按此一計劃係前任印度英軍總司令勞倫將軍於一九二三年時所草擬，以便準備萬一，在當時不過假設而已。</p>

<h3>法破獲政治陰謀　奸徒偽造文件陷害政府要人</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕法警祭今日透露在巴黎附近弗萊斯納之法奸集中營內，破壞偽造德國秘密警察證件，並使其流入外國政府之手以引起後者對法國抗戰及政治領袖產生誤會之組織。當局處置此案極為機密，奉命搜捕之警吏，於一小時前始獲通知，立即分乘警車十五輛，於午夜分批急馳該營搜查，結果捕獲十九人，內曾為德人担任密探之法人十四名，前德國諜報人員五名，此外在巴黎亦有五人與該案有關被捕，聞若干獄卒及法奸之律師，亦與此案有關。典獄長見大批人員馳至，以為有人劃獄，急電巴黎市警局，後者派警趕至，雙方幾至衝突，經說明眞相始已首批驚吏七十人，抵目的地後，立將監獄包圍，依照嫌疑犯名單，共帶走三十人，並抄獲偽造文件若干。經偵訊後，有十九人正式被　押，將以持有外國（德國）文書，及偽造文書有危國內安全等罪起訴。據內政部宣佈：弗萊斯納監獄之德國問諜，猶圓與逃亡在外之領袖通消息，彼等並請外國將據方係獲自德方擋案內之文件，供給彼等，以陷害法國之若干政治領袖，如法外長皮杜爾，渠於德軍佔法末期曾任全國抗戰運動委員會主席，以及前總理古安等。警方並謂：此等偽造文件，已有若干流入巴黎之英美大使館及領事署。在巴黎被捕之五人中，有法籍女子二人，為陰謀者担任傳遞工作。據警局人員稱，陰謀者之領袖熟悉法國之政治生活，而由一前任德國秘密警察領袖之德人起草，交獄外之德人依德官方文件格式打成，再運入監獄，由一比利時籍刻字匠加蓋偽造官印，然後再運出監獄，設法置入外國使館擋案，混充眞正之德國文件。該案領袖為前維希特工領袖建南之部下卡凡希上尉，及一前巴黎德國秘密警察領袖克萊恩，兩人在獄中分居上下二室。</p>

<h3>複雜的印度問題　統一乎？分治乎？　整個問題或將交聯合國處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：在威功湖之英印兩國發言人，對於英方以印度交選印人一事，均表示懷疑。至於印度問題將根交聯合國，則認為有可能性。</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里廿一日電〕某高級官員今日預料英國於一九四八年六日放紫統治印度之時，整個印度問題將提交聯合國會議處理。極少數觀察家相信回教同盟與國大黨能棄嫌修好組成中央政府。</p>
<p>回盟人士稱：除非回教徒與印度教徒實行完全分治，任何辦法絕不能使回盟滿意。至於印度何一部份將劃入將來回教獨立國，似將提交聯合國會議討論。目前回盟各省長控制西部之辛特省與東部之孟加拉省，前者之大城為喀拉嗤，後者之大城為加爾各答，亦即英帝國第二大城·西北部之彭加勃雀，現由聯合政府統治，回盟代表力言回盟將在英國撒退前加以佔領。在此種複雜情勢下，產生數十個問題，向非英國人與印度人所能解決，殆將提出聯合國機構。</p>
<p>孟加拉省分治後，將使印度教徒居多數之亞　姆省與印度其餘部份脫離。孟加拉與亞　姆兩省殆均將向聯合國申訴。</p>
<p>西北邊疆省，由國大黨之省長統治，他日彭加勃省獨立後，亦將被切斷。再者彭省南部尚有大批錫克族人與印度教徒，或將要求與回教分治政權脫離。孟加拉省西部以印度教徒居多數，其大城加爾各答亦然。各該區城或將要求聯合國，使之脫離分治政權。惟回盟方面則堅持加爾各答及孟加拉省西部煤礦地帶乃分洽政權所必要。當庶之希特雷巴省由回教藩王統治，但其人民約百分之八十五為印度教徒。另一方面風景美麗之喀什密省，位在希馬拉雅山肩，以回教徒居多數，但由印度教藩王統治。</p>
<p>各瀋邦在一九四八年英國退出印度後，可能繼續與英政府保持關係，但國大黨方面久巳表示，任何計劃凡容許英國勢力所及之「小島」留於印度者，均所反對。新德里方面對於英政府之聲明，既不歡欣，亦不失望。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里廿一日電〕英國昨所發表之聲明並未使國大黨成立獨立主權印度共和國之決定有所重要改變，惟國大黨方面稱一九四四年著名之查理計劃或可能為國大黨與回盟進一步談判之基礎。按查理計劃前曾為甘地所同意，此即在西北部及東部回教佔多數之地區舉行成年公民投票，以決定是否實行印回分治計劃。英國此次聲朋對於未得回盟參加之制憲會議之繼續工作是否有益，尙未確定。</p>
<p>尼赫魯所辦之報紙「民族呼聲」對英聲明所稱以政權移交地方政府之可能性，不表歡迎，並稱「此舉將為印度騷亂之開始而非結束」。</p>
<h3>對德和約討論程序　法國提折衷方案　主張設立五委員會規定任務</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕四强代表德國問題會議，今日討論外長會議下之委員會機構。法代表繆維爾提出折衷建議，欲使蘇聯之意見與其他三强意見相調和，但蘇代表古賽夫已表示對該折衷方案保留意見。法國方案將委會別為兩類：（一）政治·領土·經濟及軍事等四常務委會；（二）諮詢及情報委會。前者僅由四强代表組成，得向外長會及外長代表會提出報吿及建議，每一常務委會得設小組會，以研究各項特定問題。凡與該問題直接有關之小國亦得被邀參加。英美代表對此最後一點規定表示異議，認為除直接有關之小國外，其他小國亦應參加小組會。四強代表今日就該法國方案討論良久，未有結果。乃議決將蘇聯之程序方案中之第一部，即除委員會組織部份外之各項規定，交專家委會審查。</p>
<h3>英擬與法締盟　聯合應付蘇美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：英方現正加緊壓力，促使法國締結英法協定，俾在外長會議時，英能獲得忠實之同盟。英國同時擬建立西歐集團，其目的係在攻勢方面對付蘇聯，而在守勢方面應付美國。原因為（一）美國己威脅英法在歐洲之市塲；（二）美國現正伸張勢力至西歐各國殖民地。</p>
<h3>德境美駐軍　將全面改組　麥將軍臨別致亂</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林廿一日合衆電〕三月十五日即將繼任為德境美佔領軍司令之克萊中將，本日宣佈美佔領軍之全面改組，將使軍隊中大部分首領調集柏林，此項改組將於克氏接任麥克納奈職責時開始。情報部門首腦將調赴柏林，供應及民事部門之計劃及執行人員將留於法蘭克福。軍隊之改組在人東上幷無變更。基丁少將現將繼克氏任德境盟方調節委會美方委員。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十二日電〕德境美佔領軍司令麥克納尼現將退任，由克萊中將繼任。麥克納尼臨別致亂，對於四佔領國未能盡職實行波茨坦協定，深為不滿。麥氏主張美軍應解除軍政府賣任，而由國務院委任特派員接收管理事宜。德國此後不必全部佔領，僅須佔領其要害地方如魯爾土業區之類，即可濟事。此種佔領須自十年至十五年，以觀德國一是否已成立政府足以履行和約。總之，美軍編制及訓練，均不善於行政，佔偶政府最好出特派員主持之。</p>

<h3>「經濟緊急措施方案」補遺　上文接第二版「星期論壇」</h3>
<p>我們要求發揮各部門的機能，動員更廣泛的人力，各就崗位，分層負責，以共赴事功，完成舉國一致籲求的經濟革新運動。綜合以上論述，認為「經濟緊急措施方案」，確係當前亟要之圖，但必求推行盡利，方能解救經濟危機。議作如下之歸納，藉供各方的參攷：</p>
<p>（一）在原則上，確認由於通貨膨脹，生產落後的因素，造成物價上漲，經濟動盪的各種現狀。</p>
<p>（二）在施策上，根本須從增加生產，收縮通貨着眼，但為急則治標起見，方案中所定各項取締·禁止·管制·等措施，均須立即切實推行。</p>
<p>（三）在執行過程中，正當工商業，金融業。應忠實秉承國策，協助政府各部門，共同完成使命。但政府亦應分別良莠，扶正抑邪，勿再隔靴搔癢，以免發生相反的作用。</p>
<p>（甲）治標辦法，以收縮游資為中心：</p>
<p>（四）由政府制定法案，重申非經核定，不得經營銀行業務的禁令，凡地下錢莊，貼票公司等等，均在嚴格取締之列。普通公司行號，亦不重收入存款。如有故　，除重諜罰金外，並重處以徒刑。存款人如存放款項於非正當金融機關，除不得受法津保障外，一經罕出，並得課以罰金，或沒收存款之處分。</p>
<p>（五）隔離高利貸，農工商業需用正當借款，由正當金融機關，（包括國家行局）按切其實際需要，以低利貸給，無須向黑市塲高利求貸，使黑市資金，去路日隘，利息轉落，自然回流，改存正當行莊，轉入生產途徑。</p>
<p>（六）正當行莊，應配今國策，依法執行業務，由中央銀行與國家行局，予以經濟上之協助。</p>
<p>（七）為疏導黃金禁止買賣以後，巨額游費之出路起見，應從速改組國營生產事業，發售股票·可先就中紡公司試辦，撥定若干廠，聘請專家”分別估價公佈·委託國家行局代為發行股票，保付本息，並可透過證券交易所，公開買賣。一俟股份募集足額時，立即召開股東會。中紡當局，應即移交與完全民營之新公司董監會，執行業務。其餘各廠，及其他國營事業，均可仿照迅速辦理。終期一面吸收大量游資，凍結購買力，勿向實物作祟，一面增裕國庫收入，彌補支出預算。</p>
<p>（乙）治本辦法，以增加生產為中心：</p>
<p>（八）吾國以農立國，自來外銷物品，亦以農村特產為主。近以頻年戰亂，農村破產，即在豐年，糧食猶待舶來補充，向能自給之棉花烟葉等亦多仰給海外，消耗外匯，數不在少。民生凋敝，國計日蹙，長此以往，何堪設想？農村購買力，既異常脆弱，都市工商經濟亦難免崩潰，為此蘇復農村。實為當務之急。查自抗戰至今，四鄉不靖，農村男婦羣集都市，若勸令回鄉就業，則廬舍為墟，耕牛·農具·與種子，在在均須經濟之協助。但此為根本之岡，謀國者應從大處落目，不容顧慮觀望。茲擬先就東南西南非軍事區域，先行着手，由農林部，中國農民銀行，及中央全作金庫，會同擬訂農業增產計劃，製具預算，提經國孩子最高委員會通過施行。終期本年米麥棉花等，均能自給自足，減少外匯支出。</p>
<p>（九）農村外銷產品，如絲·茶·桐油·猪鬃·牛羊，皮毛·藥材·礦產等，應由農林部，中國農民銀行，會同往年經辦機關，如資源委員會，中信局，中蠶公司等等，立即提出計劃預算，按切季節需要，盡量貸放，勿誤農時。至少希望今年平均產量，比較去年增加一倍，推廣輸出，增益外匯收入。</p>
<p>（十）前項增產貸款計劃，經政府通過核定後，由中央銀行配備頭寸，責成中農·中蠶·等專門機關，負責辦理，不容因噎廢食，亦不容觀望推諉。</p>
<p>（十一）推廣外銷，雖經調整匯率，內外價差困難，大致暫獲解決，但今後變化正多，未許樂觀。而輸出貿易，決不可因任何困難，再有膽顧延誤。因此中信·中蠶·第機構，仍可辦理收購，供應外銷。只要辦法公允，旣非獨佔，無碍自由貿易，中外常無所藉口。將來若十種外銷物品，或仍有內外價差問題，則進出口聯鎖制度，仍不妨酌情採用。終期用各種不同約有效方法，以推廣外銷為目的。</p>
<p>（十二）工業增產，應有全盤計劃。若干種供應所需之民生日用品，與外銷物品，並可採用定貨制度，仿照客卿給爾遜氏成規，顧及廠方再生產成本，至於低利生產貸款，仍宜繼續舉辦，以隔離黑市資金，减輕產銷成本。事先由經濟部，工商輔導處，調查設備，核實貸放，再由銀行隨時稽核，杜絕流弊</p>
<p>（十三）農貸·工貸·均得按照需要，約定以實物價還一部或全部本息，由雙方按市評定公允價格。</p>
<p>（丙）管制物價，以同業議價為基礎：</p>
<p>（十四）認定今時物價，與戰時物價之重大區別，戰時以　需失調為主要原因，物價直綫上漲，故以防止囤積貨物為靈　，今時以游資過多，幣值低落為主因，防其扳價居奇，故以收縮通貨為重心，而以實施議價為手段·（根據去年經騐，直綫上漲己不可能，因利息高昂，貨源無阻，去年幾次漲風，不久自然平息，商人己不敢囤積領利）。比為今昔不司之點。</p>
<p>（十五）由政府公布義價辦法，以產運銷成本，加合法利潤？為議價原則，並得依照同業公會法，辦理同業統制。</p>
<p>（十六）依照民生日用品供應辦法，政府應經當掌握物費，控制市面。</p>
<p>（十七）控制金融，根據存款渝備盒，行莊存款為數殊徵。又鋻於此次市面瘋狂騷動，行莊安者如常，銀根亦不甚緊，能控制游資。故請另訂法案外（見第一款），各行莊亦應自動提高存息，利導游資。各行莊俟存款增加，成本减輕時，並應逐步减低放款利息，配合國策。（註）此次風朝，若干報紙標題，種為金融國潮，寗應　誤。甚至民政金融當局之書面譚話，亦以訛傳訛，調係。銀錢業之恥辱」，寗不免煞？得　新年至今，銀錢業安堵如常，存戶變動亦少，在瘋狂上漲之時，亦無提存風潮，故銀根不緊，惟聞各行局因提存者多，頭寸頗緊。行局之大存戶為誰，不難想見，則此次購金大戶，亦可是見。商業行莊本身旣不敢遠法買金鈔，而所有商業存款，大都戶多數小，亦不足波動金潮。此中實情，不查已知。綜之，此次分明是金鈔風潮，激動物價風潮’幾於婦孺皆知，而必欲歪曲事實，名之日，「金融風潮」，用意何在，殊難索解。（完）</p>

<h3>犧牲一已享受　爭取獨立自由　中美四團體慶祝華勱頓誕辰　司徒大使演說勗勉國人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國大學聯誼會，美國大學婦女聯誼會，中美文化協會，上海留美同學會，昨晚七時在逸園聯合舉行華盛頓誕辰慶祝會。到會中美名流仕女七百餘人，吳市長及美總領台縱斯等，均出席。大會由留美同學會會長韋增福任主席。會塲中左有兩柱上，高懸中美兩國國旗，遙相輝映。來賓酬酢，歡然一堂，直至深夜始散。</p>
<p>席間首由韋增複致詞，說明此次舉行聯誼會意義，並請吳市長介紹司徒雷登大使。吳氏略謂：「我國値此艱苦困難時期，我們不需要煽動者，我們需要聖賢。我們不需要外交家，我們需要善良友好的大使。本人今日深覺榮幸，向各位介紹一位先生。他誕生在中國，長大在中國，過去與吾人同生活，與吾人共甘苦。一位聖賢和導師，誠如孔子所希望之賢師，一位中國外交史上從未有之眞誠善良的大使」。繼由司徒大使發表演辭，就華盛頓爭自由爭獨立之精神，勉勵國人爲大我而犧牲小我，全辭精關感人，博得滿堂掌聲。</p>
<p>司使警語　中國真正的敵人　是文盲，貧窮，　疾病假公濟私</p>
<p>司徒大使演辭，略謂：「華盛頓誕辰雖然完全是一個美國人的紀念日，但是對於愛國的中國人，具有特別的意義。在我們今天所處戰的紀念中，我要請諸位注意到華盛頓的事業中若十情形，這些情形，對於目前中國的狀况。似乎有一種特別的意義。在評論這些情形的時候，我要請諸位把你們的歷史想像力，運用到中國的人物和問題上。</p>
<p>我們對於華盛頓一生的大事，不但要想到他對於國家的貢獻，而且還要想到他自己的犧牲。因為在那個時，華盛頓可算得美洲全部殖民地中最富有而起居最舒適的人。他的住宅有平齊的草地，屋子裏擺滿着那個時代最精雅的傢俱和裝飾品，即使以近代的標準來講，也可以認爲富麗華貴了。他擁有一切舒適和享受，然而他爲了革命的危險和不安，毫不猶豫的犧牲這一切。</p>
<p>他的朋友和同時代的的人當中，有許多像華盛頓那樣有錢的貴族階級，却不敢冒這樣的危險，寗顥維持殖民地的地位。他們中間有不少變成英國軍隊的「合作者」，很像前幾年和日本人合作或替日本人工作的那班中國人。從這裏我們可以明瞭當時華盛頓所遭遇的誘惑，和他的崇高的理想。中國對日抗戰的勝利，也是田中國領袖人物的同樣祟高的特性，中國愛國志士在他們類似的幸運中，應得感覺驕傲，我也同樣引以自傲。</p>
<p>華盛頓是為了什麼而犧牲一切？他大槪會說：那是為了自由或獨立。他所想到的是人民的自治或民主，在這自治或民主的方式中，表現出珍貴的自由，這種自由的槪念，並非在於書本裏面，而在於整個的環境和傳統裏面。林肯提到他個人受到獨立宣言的影響的時候說：「這裏面有一種情緖，不但將來永遠使本國人民獲得自由，而且使全世界得到希望，使人人都有平等的機會」。</p>
<p>這種觀念，現在已為無數的中國愛國志士所獲得。創造第一次國民黨革命和促成推翻陳舊的滿清的輝煌理想，已重現於抗日戰爭和其他各種民族運動中。中國現已獲得獨立，並在國際中取得尊嚴和極大潛在力量的地位。目前中國的問題，主要在於人民之間包括實現民主政府，和新憲法所允諾的人身自由，然而在促使這些實現的鬥爭中，每一個中國愛國人民就應以一事爲前提，那就是應該和華盛頓一樣地，願意爲大我而犧牲小我。目前中國的眞正敵人是內在的困難，克服這些困難，需要大公無私的職志和英勇而且樂觀的決心。而這種決心，都已在過去抵抗外來侵略時表現出來。中國的眞正敵人是文盲，貧窮，疾病，假公濟私，其中包括親友的私利以及狹隘而且殘酷的政黨偏見。中國的希望有待於發揚一種新的民族感。</p>
<p>看到目前國家危機的特殊性質，這種以國家為第一的崇高決心，在上海或許比較別的地方更加有影響，我希望那些曾在美國受敎育的人將最先響應這種高尚的努力。無論如何我覺得今晚在這裏的美國人，將和我同樣相信我們全國同情中國愛國志士在建設自由，統一，和平，民主政府方面的努力」。</p>

<h3>英盲爵士　嘉惠同病　中國盲人地位尚在第二階段　應聘來華指導傷殘教養工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英國肓人福利專家麥克齊爵士，昨日下午三時，偕弗拉華斯醫師在行總招待記者。席問由該署賬恤廳劉德偉女士介紹二位謂；麥爵士於第一决大戰時雙目受傷失明，現任印度政府顧問，弗醫師曾在華工作歷二十年，二氏對於中國，尤其盲人福利工作極感興趣，故此次決定來華，應行總，衛生署，敎育部，社會部聯合聘請指導傷殘敎養工作。</p>
<p>繼由麥爵士致詞稱：盲人在社會上演進地位，可分三階段：（一）最初時期，盲人全部生活處於痛苦者，黑暗，貧困，及被蔑視之中，無人照顧，蓋一般人均認爲盲目後即不能從事任何工作；（二）此時有少數集團爲盲人謀福利，雖得到一部分成功，但遭遇困難極多；（三）其後廣泛之社會團體，政府機構均注意盲人福利工作，設法救濟，教養，代覓謀生之路，而中國現即在第二階段之狀况中。</p>
<p>印度二百萬人盲目</p>
<p>麥氏力主盲人必須予以培植，可成爲有用之才，渠並報吿印度目前之肓人環境，蓋印度地處熱帶，人民受炎陽及灰沙刺激，日久成盲，故印度盲者據約略估計約有二百萬人之多。印度在過去六十年來，政府及社會機構，均逐漸爲盲人盡力工作，諸如舉辦學校，設工作塲所，訓練手工藝，社會上予以謀職之機會等等。麥氏本人在印爲盲人服務已歷四年，此外又專爲盲目士兵工作，施以同等敎育，訓練技術。盲人中現能作各種工作，如編織毛綫，布疋，毛巾，製籐椅桌籃，打字著作，音樂技師等爲數甚多，其中有二名士兵，雙目旣盲，兩臂又斷，而彼等竟能打字，此種技術係供以特製之打字機，士兵兩臂上接以人工手腕，打字迅速正確。</p>
<p>今日晋京轉赴各地</p>
<p>同時英國倫敦聖鄧斯登斯盲人院聞名全英，此係英國名記者庇埃斯於一九一五年所創設，庇氏於一九〇九年失明，極力主張盲人亦應予以訓練職業之機會，故創立此院。麥爵士本人亦屬聖鄧斯登斯院出身。</p>
<p>麥氏來滬後已訪問本市若干盲人福利機構，定今日夜車晋京，然後將赴重慶，成都，北平，廣州等各地考察，將考察結果作成報吿，俾商討求取改進，在華時期定爲二月。</p>

<h3>籃邊敏記</h3>
<p>昨夕華聯以全力藤戰，大李，阿弟，老包，學崇，相成，該是華聯的最强陣錢，雖以四球之差，勝恩卡斯，但演出不如理想，藍下防守未臻嚴密，上半時更多浪擲，僅大李和老包在常態之中，學崇欠佳，叢隊似疏於練習，但其穏妥面帶花七的傳球，尚能受砍當。</p>
<p>晨友等總林，是甲二組奪霸戰，遇程驚心動魄，晨友及紅，緣林穿綠，採人釘人戰衛，動作淸晰快速，鑛頭美觀之至·上半時比數成九比九，不分上下，下半時晨友一度以十五比十領前，是全賽最大的差額，宋幾，緣林反以十八對十七超出，以後土上落，恒在三四分之差，晨友卒以二十入比二十五完成霸業。晨友之勝，在於出手快，穿籃切入，射中較多，若論默契工夫，綠林實在</p>

<p>女組首先登塲，綠隊雪白兩路常勝不敗娘子軍，狹路相逢，綠隊五戰全勝，尙餘今日最後一課，如能順利吿捷，即再完成覇業，　聯女組王座。雪白三仗三勝，對冠軍具染指雄心，得失將視今日一役，倘能發奮圖强，一鼓而擒緣隊，則尙餘二戰，當可迎刃面解。按雙方各擁首流女將，如黃明媛·劉珍寳·王華珍·陳環治·張秀麗·朱家珍·王慧　等，球迷類皆耳熟能詳，雪自都為後起中之佼佼者，今晚戰情，</p>

<h3>國營產業如何發歸民營　昨初度交換意見　資產龐大市面資本不易承受　先估價値擬具辦法再行討論</h3>
<p>（本報訊）關於國營生產事業發歸民營辦法，昨日已由行政院副院長翁文　，召集各關係機關人氏，作初度之意見交換。會談於昨日下午四時起，在本市仁記路外灘中國銀行大樓二換舉行，迄五時卅分散席。參與會談人氏，有俞鴻鈞，王雲五，錢昌照，束　軍，劉攻芸，李馥蓀，徐寄　，泰潤卿，陳光甫，楊錫仁，徐廣遲等。</p>
<p>會後承翁副院長語記者：該會係根據經濟緊急措施方案第一條丁項規定：凡力營生產事業，除屬於重工業範圍，及確有顯著特殊情形，必須政府經營者外，應即分別緩急，以發行股票方式，公開出賣或售與民營。而由宋院長指令召集關係機關人氏，會商其實施辦法。今日會談經過，咸以為各國營生產事業，資產龐大，市面資本，恐一時無法吸收，故擬注重實際工作步驟，先由各事業之主管機關，如經濟部，資源委員會，中央信託局，敵偽產業淸理處等，先將所屬各生產事業資產估值，開列詳單，及擬具如何發歸民營辦法意見書，一併提付會中討論，然後商決實施辦法。下次會議，大致可在一週後召開云。</p>
<h3>大戶爭先脫手　華股黯然無色</h3>
<p>華股昨銳氣稍减，實力派以及銀行帮奮推，業中鉅頭，則一致傾賣，中途遂轉呈拉鋸，終以環境漸形不利，最後見疲。</p>
<p>晨開承前收餘勢而開低，勤興以開市價不甚可靠，引起大衆傾售，開後由高價降至跌停。遞永紗由一三三號一五二號一四五號九七號八號一三七號一八五號二八號二二三號奮售，降至二三五五元，一七一號二二四號七六號一七三號一七八號一四五號二三號以及散戶咸購，銀行帮納胃頗健，遞永紗拉高至二五〇〇元，一四五號一九八號一五二號一二五號二二三號賣出，退至二三九〇元。此後大事拉鋸，十一時後始再上升，由二一九號二三二號九四號二二號三一號八五號四九號九一號均進，回漲到二五七〇元。一五二號一九八號仍再傾售，二二三號一四五號二八號一〇五號亦賣，退至二三六〇元·六八號七六號二一八號尙購，遞永紗升為二五二〇元·一五二號一四五號二二三號二一九號二二四號一五四號七六號九一號一二號傾售之下，午刻跌風轉盛，退至低價結束。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞新光景福動興各跌一成至一成牛弱，華豐跌半成，冷股商務中法微升，內衣景綸平平，中絲五和九福無成交，餘者降低半成迄一成半不等，塲外各股尙形平定。</p>
<h3>債市盤旋　成交不多</h3>
<p>公債昨仍告盤旋，甲乙丙丁各債初低繼高，收後疲，戊種先高後低，成交不多，不過四百萬元。統丙晨開七五〇〇元，開後低價七三〇〇元，中途曾回升至八三〇〇元，最後站七六〇〇元左右徘徊。大戶若紗花帮有進，潮州帮則賣。結果較前收計甲乙跌六百元，丙跌一千元，丁跌五百元，戊降一千一。</p>
<h3>多頭了結　外股疲跌</h3>
<p>外股昨亦初高繼低，證券帮斬多，洋商亦有了結，怡紗自晨初一八八〇〇元，降至低價結束，結果較前收計會德獲平平，業廣跌一成，餘均下降半成左右。</p>
<h3>美金儲券及公債　均照新匯率兌換</h3>
<p>自政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案，禁止外幣流通後，外間對於美金公債美金節約儲蓄券，如何處理，頗多疑義，頃記者自財部錢幣司探悉，自政府於卅五年二月公佈外匯管理條例後，凡政府發行之美金債券，依照該條例規定，概視為外匯，故到期之美金公債美金儲蓄券，息票中籤票，均可向指定銀行依照新訂匯率兌換法幣。</p>
<h3>本年鹽貸總額　增為一千四百億</h3>
<p>四聯總處為酊合政府政策，調濟民食，增加生產，去年特舉辦鹽貸，分滬渝二區，辦理運銷及生產事宜，本年鹽本運費增漲甚鉅，豐稅又加調整，情勢大變，本年度鹽貸總額，自應增加，鹽政總局特根據實際情形，擬定全國鹽貸數額，據悉：川鹽區生產運銷貸款總額改定為八言億元，淮鹽區生產運銷貸款總額為六百二十億元，兩共為一千四百二十億元，川鹽區包括川鹽之生產及運銷區域，（一）川康區，（二）湘楚區，（三）貴州區。淮鹽區，包括（一）兩淮區，（二）山束區，（三）湘鄂區，（四）皖贛區。並悉運輸工具及建倉建設等項貸款，均包括上項貸款內，上海，重慶兩區銀園，即將召集委員會議，商議分配生產運銷之數額，並報四聯總處作最後決定。</p>
<h3>銀樓買賣飾金　錢況經營存放　錢幣司長說恐難如願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨日專訪錢幣司司長戴銘禮，叩以飾金買賣問題，據稱：關於銀樓業請求准予買賣金飾之事，因取締黃金買賣辦法第一條，即規定禁止黃金條塊及金飾之買賣，違者沒收充公，故所請恐難照辦。又錢兌業請求准予兼營小額存放業務，按錢兌業原定業務範圍巾，本無此項規定，似亦難如所請云。</p>
<h3>廢花交換紡機配件　有關方面正與日本接洽中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舫織界人士之估計，去年一年中我國自國外輸入之錠子的為兩萬錠，今年預計可輸入十萬錠，明年希望能進口二十萬錠。以本身之製造能力而論，目前我國年產兩萬錠，而日本則能生產五十萬錠，相去懸殊。據悉有關方面正在考慮以廢花交換日本之棉紡機之零件配件，因在戰前日本有一千二百萬紡錠，其附帶之設備如零配件零均與此規模相酊合，今日本之紡織業已减縮至三百五十萬錠子，故其剩餘之零配件必多；而我國目前約尙有一百萬接收之錠子，因零件之缺乏而不能開工，故此項易貨如能成功，於我棉紡織業之發展貢獻殊大。聞有關方面已進行接洽，成敗之關鍵在東京盟軍總部之態度。</p>

<h3>去年攔淺之行號　成大銀號建國銀行　財部弔銷執照　清償存款由市府及央行監辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部昨日宣佈撤銷成大銀號上海分號，及建國銀行上海分行之核准設立原案，並發表聲明如次：成大銀號上海分號，及建國銀行上海分行，均於上年十二月二十以後，因周轉失號，停止交換，前經財政部派員檢查，獲悉滬成大銀號平時業務，即欠正常。放歡極為浮濫，舉凡經理人員挪用行款，逃繳存歡準備金，買竇金鈔等情弊，不一而足。且復設立暗賬，隱隊資負眞相，並作非法經營，企圖逃避管制。又建國銀行平日放款，亦不遵照業務正規辦理，頗多不合，並有設立暗戶，記載收益之情事。迨銀根吿緊，存戶擠提，該兩行號遂先後宜吿擱淺。財政部當為保障存戶利益起見，經分別限期償還存款。一面責令將全部債權債務理楚具報，聽候核辦。乃該兩行號債權債務之淸理，閱時月餘，仍少頭緒。財政部為示懲戒，並儆效允起見，昨已分別將該成大銀號上海分號，及建國銀行滬渝分行核准設立之原案，予以撤銷。至於存款之淸償，並已電請上海市政府及中央銀行監督辦理，以保障存戶利益云。</p>
<p>記者昨特趨訪財政部錢幣司司長戴銘禮，據稱：財政部為該兩銀行分行被停止交換事，曾於本年一月二十九日分別行文該兩行，囑於文到之日起，半個月內將全部存款及所發本票理楚，一個月內將全部債務理楚。後於二月八日接成大銀號滬分號覆電稱：正在籌款理楚中。又同日亦接建國銀行滬分行覆電稱：決遵令照辦。惟迄仍未見理楚竣事，實有未合云。</p>
<p>按成大銀號滬分號，係於去年十二月二十三日，遭票據交換所停止交換。該號總店於民國二十九年創設於重慶。資本二千萬元，最近擬增資至五億元。董事長李組紳。總經理兼上海分號經理張裕良，副經理張靜涵。</p>
<p>建國銀行滬分行係於去年十二月二十六日遭票據交換所停止交換。該行係於民國三十年五月，由孫麟方等在渝號起創立，資本為一萬萬元。三十五年三月二十六日，成立滬行。六月一日，總處亦遷滬辦公。六月十日，滬行正式開業。本市除南京路二〇〇號分行外，尙有南京西路七九五號，及林森中路九六三號支行兩處。現任董事長並總經理為孫麟方，滬行經理為樊雨琴。</p>

<p>棉布市况開盤平穩，十二磅龍頭細布略有去化，一度喊十四萬七千元。嗣買戶以謠多拋售，便直降二千元。紡建公司供售五福細布，價開十四萬三千元，與市價相彷，致人心轉堅。市上色布去路不旺，染敞對白坏添胃亦懈，致市面呈堅中帶軟之勢。</p>
<h3>食米交易不旺　油豆去胃轉佳</h3>
<p>昨南北米市共到一萬三千五百餘石，市塲交易動而不旺。粳米高貨定局，中下續跌千餘元。白元隨之下挫一二千元，陰元平疲之勢。</p>
<p>麵粉去胃轉淡，止漲轉跌，回小三五百至千餘元不一。麩皮趨入盤旋之局。</p>

<h3>麵粉恢復配售</h3>
<p>本市福新茂新阜豐華豐裕通等五大麵粉廠，曾一度以原料吿罄，無法生產，故停止酊售麵粉，茲悉各廠現在當局之協助下，原料供應問題已瑛解決，故配粉工作，即日起予以恢復，每袋仍為三萬元。另據消息稱：政府當局前向美國訂購鉅額小麥及洋粉，現已有麵粉五萬包，由福來公司之「赫德號」裝載來華，業已駛抵淞口，明日即可抵埠云。</p>
<h3>紗市實銷仍稀</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍無轉機，實銷依然徵末，人心亦乏振作之氣。惟晨初普通廿支紗如立馬等牌，降近三百萬邊後，復為業中人所垂靑，浮根殺清後，價又回昂至三百十萬上下，結果較上日略挫三五萬元之譜。</p>
<h3>防雨布價轉昂</h3>
<p>防雨布邇日市銷續轉活躍，京滬杭路各地均有相當實銷，售價亦步趨高昂。頭號貨每碼喊沽一萬六千元；二號貨一萬三千元，蓋其標準之轉移，均以紗價上落及廠方成本盤價為標準。</p>
<h3>外銷綠茶　受買方青睞</h3>
<p>洋莊祁門紅茶，因吐納談判，未能順利，市勢依然淸閒。而向受非洲一帶垂愛之抽珍，珍眉，針眉等綠茶，脫手愈益活躍，行情亦頗秀穩。陳中珍眉，刻下尙有七百餘箱，注裕泰茶號及午昌茶葉公司，均在與貨方磋商中，聞價格相差不遠，大致下週初可瑛成議。至專供內銷之大方，龍井，雙　等花色，以賣戶一味堅持，進購者極難下手，猶呈寂寞之象。</p>
<h3>江海關增加　報單遲延費</h3>
<p>關於本市各商向海關報關，呈遞報單，每因時間之忽促，多有不能於規定內呈報，按海關向例，凡商人在每日規定時間以後　遞出口報單者，每一報單需象收遲延費國幣四百元，今因物價上漲，四百元之數商人付出不以為意，故海關方面特　總稅務司核准，將該項報單遲延費每一張增至二千元，該關現已實行云。</p>
<h3>日將以交通器材　蝗我兩種原料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面消息：中日間易貨工作，正在積極推進。除窰木為北方各大煤礦復員所迫切需要外，日本各地剩餘之交通器材，尤為我國當前所急需。經我國有關當局與麥帥總部一再交涉後，已有具體結果，總部聞已允在未來兩年之內，以三百個火車頭及二千車皮輸華，而由我國供給日本以某兩種原料，作為代價。此事原則已決定，惟價格問題則尙待磋商。至於日本之希望我國供應者，首為一百萬噸之食鹽。外間對於我以食鹽供日，頗多批評，認為將助長日本之化學工業。但深知內情者，則認為食鹽具有世界性之市塲，如我國不以食盬輪日時，英國將以非洲鹽運往供應，於事無補，徒失市塲。又日本之植物油巳感缺乏，下半年時需要更殷，亦希望我國供給。此外，聞尙有黃豆兩萬噸，亦將於本年內運往日本。台糖則我國本身而要迫切，雖經對方一再請求，亦未允接濟。但以日本黑市之高，部份之走私在所難免。</p>
<h3>豬雙到源充沛　拆價頓轉疲軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前以陰兩多日，靠隻到貨甚　，詳肉拆價，每百市斤上漲至三十八萬元。日來天時放晴，各路購　充沛，今市拆價價已下跌至三十一萬元。零售精肉，及助條等，舊復較前無甚軒經</p>
<h3>工業原料　漲跌互見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業原料，交易巳漸展開，但成交種類，及數量尙不甚大。月牌燒碱每桶五百五十萬有成交，液體燒碱四〇Baume每噸四百四十萬元。純碱繼續下游，每袋八十公近之麥加利貨做價二十二萬元。紅　鈉每磅四千元，鋅氣粉每噸升二百萬元，現價為一千萬元。三角甘油，市貨極缺，僅印度甘油有成交，每聽五六磅，價為一百五十萬元左右</p>
<h3>皮革價升銷滯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自外匯提高後，紋皮進口成本增加，價格銳升。樹牌紋皮每英呎由三萬二千元，升至五萬五千元。順風紋皮由二萬七千元升至四萬五千元，金鋼贊紋皮由二萬六千元升至四萬三千元。生皮到貨轉稀，出口已動，價亦跟蹤挺堅。生牛皮每百市斤由二十八萬元升至四十五萬元，大版黃牛皮由五十五萬漲至八十萬元，各貨實銷並不甚旺。聞漢口方面水牛皮每司馬担三十六萬元，黃牛皮每司馬祖十一萬元。</p>
<h3>全國紗廠設備調查　國省民營合計二二四廠</h3>
<p>據上海機聯會統計，我全國紗廠目前共有二百二十四家。計國營四十一家，省營二家，民營一百八十一家。國營廠擁有紗錠二百九十萬枚，布機三萬八千餘台；省營廠僅有紗錠二十萬枚，民營廠擁有紗綫錠二百六十八萬枚，布機三萬餘台。國營與民營的比較，紗錠民營廠略多，綫錠則國營廠比民營廠約多一半。茲探誌如次，以供各方參考。</p>

<h3>炭都撫順</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽十六日航訊　本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>長白山，從東向西南方斜走着，餘脈形成了波狀丘陵，過了撫順，再向西就投入遼東平原，撫順便是在這遼東平原的邊緣上，襟山帶河，地勢雄壯。</p>
<p>市區，東西長有二十公里，傍着渾河的南岸，南北，則以河各爲限，只有六七公里長，渾河從東蜿蜓穿過境內，會合溫道，馬郡丹，柳林，古城子諸小河和太子河合流，而入遼河，流進激海。</p>
<p>撫順，南有本淡，北接鐵嶺，法庫，東至淸源，新賓，西邊和瀋陽緊緊接壤，相距八十華里，全市面積的合九千一百二十三萬零五十平方公尺，四面圍着矮山，氣候在酷寒時期的爲攝氏零下二十五度，夏季最熱的時候，的在三十七度左右，十二月上旬，到三月上旬，爲結冰寒季，雨量，據統計有年漸增加之勢，平均每年雨量達一千耗。</p>
<p>歷史寶地</p>
<p>五十年來，國人的血汗和勞役，才建立成了現代化的都市，新的設備，寬的柏油馬路，機關多半是高樓大厦，電燈，電話，電車，應有盡有，夏天有設備完全的游泳池，冬天有闊大壯麗的滑冰塲，市體育塲規模宏大，看台足容兩萬人，室內體育塲，也極其講究，中山紀念堂，堪稱東北最考究的大建築，舞台是可以旋轉的，撫順可以算做一信很好的都市了。</p>
<p>五十年前，這塊地方，原極簡　，不豐是渾河南岸一寥落的寒　、稀疏約有幾十戶人家，純粹　　　村社會，現在邁出市區，路人田圍鄕村的境界，則仍保有成駐的稽山，菜圃，產量可觀，能以自足自給，尤其是大米，用的是日本改良種籽，顆粒圓大，顏色潔白，尤為上品，十幾年來，這種糧食，乃是日本人專用品，不許我們中國人吃的，現在自然你可以在撫順隨時隨地可以享用了。</p>
<p>撫順舊名「千金塞」，是以遠東第一大煤礦著名於世界的，後來由於這個煤礦母親，繼續孕育了不少子工業，造成了一個純粹日本化都市，也可以說是日本人悉意經營，壓榨的偉大傑作，敵人投降後，張莘夫先生來此接收罹難，又惹起了全國全世界的注目。</p>
<p>站在古城子西「露天掘」的邊緣上，縱目矚眺，闊的三里，長的四里，原的一百二十五公尺的煤層。還裊裊地冒着「自燃」的白烟，幾十條輕便運煤的電車軌道，像蜘蛛網般的電綫，眞是一個偉大的塲面。</p>
<p>明朝，這座撫順城，呌做「鎖陽城」，淸太祖勃起於興京，沿渾河向下游伸張勢力，於是鎖陽城便首當其衝，立被征服，易今名曰「撫順城」，於是撫順之民就被撫而順之了。</p>
<p>民國成立以來，我們也沒有得機會親自掌握這千金塞，相反的我們還記得日俄在此假我們的國土做角逐戰塲，前年這塊肥土，又被視爲戰利品，而橫遭刦奪，殘破刦後的撫順，人口已减少了三分之一，工業現時只恢復戰前十分之一二。</p>
<p>煤業工業</p>
<p>大槪二千年前，已經有人利用煤了，不過大規模的開採，當在千年以前，高勾麗遼金時代，用爲製造陶器的燃料，其後興亡相繼，紛擾不絕，恐怕只有土人採掘一些作爲燃料而己。</p>
<p>至光緖廿七年，有王承堯·顏之樂等三人，呈准奉天將軍，小規模開採，後來因爲資力薄弱，滲入了俄國資金，三四年後，日俄戰起，此一寳藏便被日本掌握了。</p>
<p>「南滿鐵道株式會社」，在日俄戰後那年（明治四十年）開始創立，五十年來，從掘煤起，逐漸擴充了，各種附屬工業，成了一個整個系統，最初有「千金塞」「楊柏堡」「老虎台」三個坑，隨後又新闢「大山」「東鄕」兩個坑，以後逐漸又增開了「老萬」「龍鳳」等，一共成爲八坑，由每天三百噸的產量增至三萬噸。</p>
<p>整個礦區，東西的十七公里，南北的四公里，面積爲六〇一六萬平方尺，地質年代，爲第三紀煤層，越往西越厚，最厚的地方有一百廿五公尺，最薄的層也有十五公尺，煤質爲有烟長燄瀝靑性煤，比重一二七，平均發熱量六九六〇卡，確是上等的化學原料煤—低溫蒸餾，製藥，染料，輕重油，可燃氣體，阿摩尼亞等等，都在其中。</p>
<p>撫順不僅是一個煤炭機械的都市，同時附屬工業也極發達，第一個誕生的是油母頁岩的蒸餾工廠（製油工廠），又過六七年，成立製鐵工廠，液化工廠，又製鉛工廠（輕金屬），電解廠（製氫氣氧氣），電石製造，水煤氣廠，也先後成立。</p>
<p>其他小工廠硫酸廠（吸收低溫蒸餾之阿摩尼亞氣代爲硫酸肥料），黑色炸藥廠，耐火磚廠，煉焦廠，不外乎是副產品的利用，多是小規模製造，爲了煤礦本身之用的。</p>
<p>其中特別値得一提的便是「機械工廠」，規模宏大，設備週全，再有便是「發電廠」，發電能力原爲二十一萬KW，因爲機械被某方拆走了十分之七，所以現在僅能發電五萬KW，還有一個「化學研究所」，也頗値得一提，到日本投降時止，已經研究過而有貢獻成爲企業化學的，統計有十五個大題，設備也極佳，再有煤礦醫院，恐怕是使决於「協和大醫院」了，過去，「南滿醫科大學」畢業生，必得經過這個醫院的實習，才算畢業，因而成爲東北醫藥人才唯一的養訓機構。</p>
<p>恢復力量</p>
<p>撫順全市是一個二三十萬人口的大都市，現在除了二十萬零五千六百五十四個國人以外，還有七千一百三十一個日本人，三千二百一十三個朝鮮人，其他外國人十二人，總計是二十一萬六千零一十人。</p>
<p>撫順，商店總數約有三千六百家，現大部尚能維持，金融機構，除了中央銀行之外，農民，中國，交通，皆已設行，此外並有三家私人商業銀行。</p>
<p>今天，工商業的恢複，僅及過去十分之一二，大小工廠原有三百四十九家，其中有八十三家較大的，現在復工僅五一幾家，煤的產量，亦衹有過去總產量的六分之一。</p>
<p>撫順人民，對於資委會接收的撫順煤礦，有些非議，說詞是：煤礦處長，來來去去，沒辦法拿全副力量來辦事，此外一些接收人員，又和工人距離太遠，生活沒能打成一片，薪給旣懸殊，中間又造成了一條鴻溝，加以事務人員，日漸加多，負實際工作的工人，反而設法减少。因而影響工作，生產力薄弱，並且潛伏着工潮危機，我們眞迫切希望有合理的改善，稍有疏忽，罪過太大了。</p>
<p>爲了撫順，也是爲了遼寗，爲了整個東北和中國，我們要使全國重視撫順，恢復和加强撫順的煤礦和所有的工業，撫順人民，更希望把遼寗省會設置在撫順，因爲把一個省的政治重心，擺在這查，或能增加一些恢復撫順的力量！</p>

<p>與外族通婚　巴黎六日航訊　本報特約記者宏負</p>
<p>三十五年十一月八日本報自由談國外瑣開『昭君想』，舉一例萬，顯見中外人品質德性，根本不同。按華女與外族通婚，王昭君實其創例，英文稱共外族通婚之事曰外媾Exo-gamy，源出希臘文，而稱重婚罪日倍購bigamy，則與單夫獨妻之獨Mono-gamy正相反，其多妻制日普媾Poly-gamy，多夫制則曰普夫Ply-andry，西方人物質文明，誠哉可驚，惜其精神上之文明根柢，遠不若中國之深，其人不知「忍」人之所不能忍，小遇風波，每易演成不可思議之笑話，西方之人生，只知利己Ego-ism，只求快自身一時之樂，而如我中國之貞孝節烈，都爲利他Altru-ism，此精神上別有之光榮，絕非西方人所能了解，在第二屆歐戰期中，荷國女子嫁與坎拿大兵者五萬人，法國則有二十萬之女性無受主，其共外國軍人正式成婚者，已逾二萬，所生男女孩，須假互厦以收容者逾三萬，先是德軍人佔法地，法男丁紛紛逃匿，所餘女性，多共德軍人私通，其後德方敗退，又共美國兵拚合，致須有七千餘之新嫁娘，西渡而人新大睦，亦有成婚不久，文複離婚者，在德境則德女與聨合國軍人所生小孩，食量比尋當之德孩爲大，德女無力瞻養，每出售與官方，而勞工營德女，戰期受孕，恒假外科手術　而去之，西方女往往濫交異性，本人所履歐美諸學府，舍美國之女子，尚見自高其聲價外，歐地則無適無禁，人欲橫流，輒令束身自愛之鑄，興不可響邇之歎，設令意志薄弱之靑年，遇茲環境，其人學業前程，豈有不受妨害之理，至若獨身遠遊之男性華僑，環境不若大學生之淸高，經此第二回歐戰長期，其與外族通婚，毫無選擇對方之任何眼力，苟或仳離，引起糾紛，釀成訴訟損失之多，自更不堪設想，而在本國一方面，數十年堅貞苦守之髪妻，反至望洋無計而求助無門，我政府胡弗省慮及此，進爲此輩家小，啓智　，籌出路，略師日本式之僑民訓練所，兼效新大陸敎育方案，使彼一切女性，易臻美化易　少年化乎，此舉於國計民生，出入之間所關甚大，私意爲兩全計，尚宜變通法律，使誤入迷途之海外赤子，仍可回心轉意，接近其舊有之家庭，憶於三十六年前，偶見上海神州日報揭一題，徵求讀者解答，意則「何以女性只便愛一人』當時答案如林，大抵隔靴搔癢，予意擬答之曰「愛之爲物於女性實其生命，而男性則一生事業爲重，大多數尋常男子所謂不愛之過佔其生活中之一小部分：』男子苟僅孜孜爲利，無論如何，總不難兼顧本鄕原有之家庭，惟如想及人生最後之希冀，終是純粹血統之子女爲可信恃，大抵混血兒，智鐵　可甚充足，而道德恒不及純粹血統之高，今世鄕野之民，尚不免與較繞近者爲婚所生子女，智力若後差而德性獨厚。大城出生之子女，血統易於龐雜，道德已不逮鄕哥之高，當代之偉大人物，往往誕乃可爲羣衆造福，是皆純粹血統遠勝混血兒之鐵證，謀國者於此，有不容忽視者也。</p>
<p>某富僑逝於戰期，立有遺囑，指定由中國髪妻之十，運柩回國，並撥定額之還款備用，其洋婦所生之十，岡爭此款，忽犯刑章：竟盜掘父尸付之火，西方人一切無所信，此其例之一也，西方某富商，遺命身後於遺產中撥取巨款，購一有價之巨石爲紀念，其意當然指墓碍言，不料其子旣受遣產，複利此巨額之金，而欲獵爲己有，謀諸大律師，忽得一奇計，即置一紀念乃父之金剛鑽戒，而戴上指端，蓋金剛鑽亦石也，遺囑所云紀念之石，固未加附註，未言必置於墓前，此蓋遺矚之傐聞也，筆而書之，可供邦人一粲。</p>
<h3>華僑返國投資第一砲　發展福建經濟</h3>
<p>— 十三日航訊　本報福州特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>我們在國內的人，對於旅居各地的華僑，都有一個直覺的看法，認爲他們個個都有壯而且黑的身體，算盤的本領與數不淸的鈔票，似乎他們都是一顆明幌幌的財星。其實，國內人只看到華僑發財的一面，沒有看到旅况悽凉的慘象！他們依人籬下，受盡土著民族的排擠，當地政府的種種苛待，往往終年胼手胝足，不得一飽。流落到海外的僑胞，多半是在國內生計窘迫，他們憑着僅此一付的扁担作爲生財工具，經歷長年風霜，競兢戰戰克勤克儉立業起家，少數幸運者一帆風順事業日隆一躍而爲大資太家，如此次福建經建公司發起人之一王振相先生，當年是一個礦工，而今在南洋各埠頭擁有十三家大公司，便爲一例。</p>
<p>長安不可久居　投資開發家鄕</p>
<p>戰爭結束後，南洋各地醞釀着一股民族自決運動的潮流，大者如荷屬東印度及越南各地的衝突，僑胞生命財產得不到保障，寃死異鄕的亦大有人在，而且，太平洋戰事爆發後，南洋各屬領僑胞的慘遇，不忍追述，僑胞憑其多年累積的經騐深知長安雖好，不可久居，寄人籬下，終是痛苦，不如以其所擁有之大量資金及在南洋各地經營的企業設法移回祖國，以復興爲戰爭所頽廢的祖國。</p>
<p>閩籍僑領胡文虎及馬來亞代表黃重吉，林慶年，王振相，何葆仁，菲律賓代表薛芬士，荷印代表黃超龍，越南陳肇基，暹羅蘇振壽，緬甸李良遠等人同意協力投資開發福建經濟，提出「集中力量建設家鄕」「建設家鄕就是建設國家」口號，籌組福建經濟建設公司，於去年十一月十五日在厦門市商會舉行發起人大會，出席南洋各屬五百萬閩僑代表發起人七十餘人，閩省黨政當局皆蒞會參加，開僑胞回國投資之先聲。情緖激揚，表現僑界空前團結之新氣象。各僑領僉認非建設富强康樂之鄕邦不足以自存，要求政府予以協助，並給以權利上之保陣，省府劉生席鄭重宜示政府願輔以技術上之協助與安全之保障。</p>
<p>僑領分頭募股　草擬業務計劃</p>
<p>發起人大會閉幕後，成立籌委會，推定胡文虎氏爲常委，施性水，王振相，黃重吉等百餘人為公司籌委，分頭策劃募股事宜，決定公司資金總額三百億，分配如下：（一）馬來亞一百億，業已超額募足，（計星洲四十五億，比叻十二億，雪蘭義，檳城，柔佛各十億，馬六甲，森美蘭，彭什各三億，吉打及玻璃市共二億，吉蘭舟，丁加奴各一億），（二）菲律賓，東印度，緬甸，越南，暹羅共一百億，（三）省內及港滬共一百億，分三期募足，預計南洋各地之籌募較省內爲易，惟此鹿大股款之匯兌因各地匯率高低不同，及僑居地對於僑匯之限制不無一些困難。關於經匯銀行，亦經籌委會愼重確定以中央，福建省行，華僑三家爲主，並推出代表胡文虎，何葆仁，黃重吉，林慶年等分別醫京向中樞接洽，請特准設立建設銀行，辦理僑匯及抵押業務，作爲僑胞投資之橋樑。</p>
<p>經建公司總公司設厦門，必要時省內外分設分公司，經營業務除建設銀行爲主外，並興辦省內工礦，農林，水利，漁鹽及交通事業，尤其注意對於閩省特產貿易之扶助，工礦之開發，以逐漸誘導閩省趨於工業化之一途。</p>

<p>自從去年杪經建公司籌委會成立後，榕厦洋溢着一片經建熱，盤桓於上層人士腦際間者乃如何誘導更多僑資開發閩省富源。公司發起人收到不少建議及計劃書，有謂首重交通，有謂先設銀行，見仁見智，各有道理。白崇禧部長曾乙國防觀點論夏門今後地位，實超越於上海之上，厦門扼南洋航路之衝，五洲船舶，萬國商賈，萃集於此，厦門港爲南部第一良港，可進泊三萬噸之巨輪。値得開發，王雲五部長就經濟立塲，認爲欲爭取南洋市塲，必須完成由沿海口岸伸向腹部之鐵路，閩首任建設廳長陳體榮氏曾大聲疾呼興築閩贛鐵路北上啣接浙贛路之重要，原則上已得中央之核准，及加拿大廠商三千五百萬美元之投資，渠要求經建公司以百分之十股款投資鐵路公司。此外，省內人士則以開發古田之能亭及仙遊之九鯉湖之水力發電，可誘臻無數小工業之勃興，對閩省紡織印刷五金電器等製造工業，允將給予長足發展機會。有謂扶植特產貿易爲獲利捷徑者，閩省輿論界亦紛紛著論臘陳所見，蔚成建省運動之浪潮。</p>
<p>前途如何　尚待僑領合作</p>
<p>經建公司這些發起人當中，多半在南洋辦有私人企業，而且，規模龐大，發起人大會後，僑領大半返回原地，據云是回去募款或作撤移其企業回國之準備。這些僑領當中，有的出身鑛工，對於閩省安溪的鐵鑛饒有極大之興趣。有的向來往商，對於閘北的特產貿易主張大量投資。有的經營紡織業，對於龍溪一帶的紡織業願意投資。有的　身航海，認爲發展沿海航運是第一要圖。各有所志，各圖所好，會分散了公司的力量，擇要而舉，分別先後，是建設的要訣。這必須僑領通力合作，全盤計劃才好。</p>
<p>據云公司　金已足二百億元，四月一日在厦將召開創立會，宣佈公司正式成立，從而開始乘務計劇之實施。我們希望福建經建公司之成立，能夠切切實實辦幾件事業，地方政府予以方與協助，作爲一個華僑返國投資運動的開端，用華僑雄厚的資金復興這經膠長期災難的祖國。</p>
<h3>美國的民族文獻館</h3>
<p>— 紐約八日航訊　黎東方</p>
<p>拿着赫邁博士的介紹信，拜訪了梭崙。布克先生（SolonJ.Buck），吿訴他：我是中國國史館名譽顧問，曾經在法國的民族文獻館作過四年研究。布克先生是美國民族文獻館的館長，總了我的話十分興奮。他怪我爲什麼不肯在華盛頓多留幾天，可以彼此暢談。我這個天涯孤睢，不得不趕緊又要飛到東北方去敎書呢。</p>
<p>我很感謝布克先生和他的幾位帮手，忙了大半天，把文戲館的各個部門都領略了。比起巴黎的那一個來，就設備與組織講，眞是後來居上。最呌我高興的，是地下室特設消毒部。凡是進館的文件，不管有蟲無蟲，都把牠蕉上一蕉。我想到了此地來埋首故紙堆中的人，不會再感到身上發癢了。我想特別寫一封信吿訴巴黎的那位老館長，又怕他老人家誤會。</p>
<p>又呌我佩服的，是美國人不惜工本（其實花錢不多）把字跡模糊及脆弱或特別寳貴的文件，都用透明紙裱托一番，然而不用漿糊，而用化學方法加上物理方法。用化學方法使得透明紙會粘，用物理方法把牠使勁壓緊。咱們的古書與史料何不運來都這樣裱牠一下？或是托我買一部機器帶回中國？（便宜得很，並無回扣。）</p>
<p>他們有錢，自不消說。特別蓋了一座洋房（成爲美京的名勝之一），其中每一層樓與每一間房子都有特殊的指定任務。二樓的展覽室很大，經常有珍貴材料陳列。我所遇到的是憲法的十决修正案，與大淸帝國某位使臣的國書（雙龍環抱，漢滿合壁，不寫英文，金絹硃印）。閱覽室有東西二間及中間的目錄間。愛打字或照像的，另有一間不會防礙到別人的一間。（法國人還不肯在文獻館打字。）藏卷的地方完全是鋼門與水泥墻壁，萬一失火，也只會燒掉一間。倘若眞失起火來，即使只是一間，也就太丟人了。我想這個房子除了天空上掉下什麼來，是不會失火的。巴黎是用紙盒子分藏各卷，美國是用扁而大的鋼抽屜。除了閱覽室以外，還有一個小型的岡書館，把六萬五千本有關美國歷史與各種社會科學的書擺在書架子上讓你隨時翻檢。還有兩位歷史家，叫做歷史專員，是常設的活字典，你有什麼不懂或忘記了的事，儘管去問他們。他們的職務，正是供你參考。他們也有答不出來的時候，但是決不惱羞成怒，反而很高興地去代問更內行的朋友，或是的朋友與你會面。——我看任何人都可以到此地來大做研究，很容易在此地寫一篇有關美國膠史的論文。</p>
<p>他們的檔案，截至現在爲止，在書架子上已有三十二萬尺長。（所佔的架子有三十二萬尺長。）其中大部份是國務部於此館在一九三五年成立以前所保管的。凡是國會，法院及行政各部的稱許過時的檔案都集中在此地。各機關隨時需要參考，仍可借回。</p>
<p>我記得當　思政府　仍在重慶的時候，各機關多半苦於防空洞小，無法堆置其檔案，常將稍許過時的檔案付之一炬。後來國史館籌備處知道了，函請大家於焚毀以前，讓國史館籌備處派人來看一下，選擇重要的帶回保存。這眞是搶救。也幸虧如此，雖然各機關肯這樣准人搶救的並不多，至少那些被焚的檔案在精神上獲得安慰不少。</p>
<p>我常常强調，漢朝如何重視檔案，各州郡的計書要以正本送給太史，副本才送給丞相。今日中國的國史館，自難向各機關說得明白如此迂腐的辦法；倘若我們不引證自己的不値錢的古史，面引證各方面都呌人傾倒的頂値錢的美國例子，也許各機關會立刻照辦的。說得不客氣點，一個民族有無靈魂，或其靈魂是否喪失，正要看牠對於文雅琦的態度。</p>
<p>我勿的國史館，實在該改稱為民族文獻館。因爲官方修史的事，旣不合潮流，而實際上我們也並未仿照歷代國史館的辦法編什麼「實錄」。政府能擴充國史館爲民族文獻館，旣可以集合各機關的檔案，永便檢查，又可以帮助肯寫歷史的學者，讓大家根據眞實的材料云自由的寫。</p>
<p>一個研究中國近代史的人，是不可以不來美國民族文戲館來搜尋一番的，因爲美國駐華的公使與領事館有經常的報吿回國，而一概收藏在此地。倘若關於洪秀全，李鴻章，慈禧太后，袁世凱等等我們都可以增加不少新的知識。</p>
<p>除了紙片的材料以外，此館又有留聲機片及有聲電影。威爾遜總統的音容已渺，但是他的聲音猶在。倘若第二次大戰後有這樣一個理想家在國際舞台上，也許不會糟到今天的樣子罷！這是一篇競選演講。羅斯福也有好幾篇演講存在此地。爲什麼不把雅爾達與德呈蘭這兩次盛會的記錄也保存起來呢？在電影的項目之下，多數是Movietone新聞片子。然而昨日之新聞正是今日之歷史。有一卷眞正的電影最爲名賣，是有史以來的第一部片子，曼麗辟克福主演的，由這位皇太后親自送給此館。福德公司也送來了一部製造汽車的片子。</p>
<p>美國的歷史不長，但是比起我們來，似乎史料比我們多。是他們不好，還是我們不好？</p>
<h3>世界性的果樹園　嘉義沛業試驗支所</h3>
<p>— 八日航訊　本報駐臺記者楊育</p>
<p>直屬於長官公署的農業試騐所，在全省共有十個支所。嘉義位當西部平原的中心，恰巧位於北緯歸線上，對農業試騐是一塊理想的地方，所以在山子頂公園內也設有着一個支所，且已保持着二十八年的歷史。甘藷改良農業與軍需配合。過去該所工作的範圍很廣，到近年來方逐漸减縮，專注全力於甘藷的改良研究，據支所長楊守仁吿訴記者，這種工作不但爲全合省的老百姓所熟知，而且在遠東也是極有地位的。這裏試騐的結果，甘諸可以終年種植，縮短育種年限，而且開花正常，可以應用雜交方法加以改良，最有趣的是甘藷也有種子可以種植。</p>
<p>在這裹未曾對甘諸加以研究試騐前，當地出產的甘藷所舍的澱粉在只有百分之十五至十八，可是應用了這裏的改良種後，長出的甘藷和澱紛百分之三十以上，嘉義附近所有百分之八十以上的農家現在已經完全採用了改良種。戰時日本人曾在這裏建立了一座居東亞第四位的大規模丁醉工廠，儘量供應着作戰用的燃料，原料就是這裏所產的甘藷，假使澱粉的含量不在百分之三十以上，這個工廠是無法加以利用的，農業的研究和軍事的需要相配合，道一點不能不說是日本的成功，値得我們警惕的。</p>
<p>「果中之后」　女皇帝終身遺憾</p>
<p>除掉甘藷的研究極著成績外，這裏的果園也頗負聲譽的。二百多畝試騐地，果樹佔了五分之二，有一百二十一個種，二百六十多個品種，戰爭末期這裏駐滿了騎兵，到處据了防空洞，損失很大，經個接收後十個月的整理，房屋已換然一新，過去寶貴的記錄下久也要出版了。現在果國一共有四個：包括全世界三十多個改良品種的鳳梨園，咖啡園Sapodilla園，和芒果園，其中芒果因爲溫度不够，始終沒有菲列賓產的那種香味，所方已經認是失敗了，其他許多地土上，則分別値了各種名貴的果樹。有一種呌Mangosteen紅皮白肉，色香味具臻上乘，稱爲果中之后，Queen　of　fruits原產新加坡，可是從沒有結過果實，維多利亞女皇雖因爲屬地上有這種產物，引爲是大英帝國的榮譽，但她到臨死依然思念着它，而以不能一嚐爲終身憾事。這裏所植的四，五株十五年來也沒有結實，但去年竟連結兩决，是台省光復後的一大盛事，陳儀長官特地爲它起了一個字名呌「鳳果」。</p>
<p>橄欖提油　看能否成為國寶</p>
<p>棍支所長又領導記者參觀了很多稀有果樹：（Sapodilla），南美產，果實非常甘美，白色的汁水黏性很大，普通是用作橡皮糖的原料，日本人過去很寳貴這種果賓，每年僅拿來作爲進貢天皇的厚禮。「果中之王」（Klngof　fruits）的酪果，是夏威夷的產物，果實有着甜的牛奶味，三年前被破壤得很重，現在已經修復，而且已採下了一個做標本陳列着。可可樹的小花是開在樹幹上然後結果的，日本人當初莫名其妙，竟把下面的花朶給修剪掉，現在只在上部結着少許果實。Cnistel的果子和芒果差不多，奇怪的是肉作蛋黃色，吃起來也有蛋黃味，墨西哥種的Malabar，在世界上很稀少，果實像栗子可以炒熟了吃，最大功用是因爲根比莖粗，而且蔓延很廣，是一種極理想的防風樹，台省已有很多工程機關到這裏來請求移植。美國加民福尼亞大學敎授霍金生亦曾到這裏來參觀過，墨西哥離加民福尼亞很近，可是他說並沒有見到過這種優良的防風樹。錫蘭橄欖落得滿地皆是，楊支所長說現在正在研究它的成份，看是否可以提鍊像地中海橄攬樹果實中一樣的滑潤油，一切精密機械少不掉這種油，德國在戰時唯一有求於土其耳的也就是這種東西，倘使我們的研究得能成功，那將無異是「國寶」了。</p>

<h3>世界名書助學義展　西洋書欣賞的基礎</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>所謂洋畫，就是指一般的油畫，水彩書，素描來講，這其實是從物質材料上去分別的，如果以形式來分，那又可別為壁　　，額畫和速寫，以內容來分，只可別為靜物，風景，動物和人物等等。</p>
<p>國為西洋藝術的本源，出自古希臘的人間的現實的精神，雖則經過了中世紀的下半期，高唱着古希臘精神的復現的文藝復興來了，於是西洋藝術復歸於現實的陶醉，所以西洋書中傳統精神便是寫實。我們欣賞它的人，便不得不在這一點上着眼</p>
<p>考寫實的手法，是由於基礎的素描而獲得所謂基礎素描，通當多指本炭而言，因為他可以練習描寫輪廓的凖確，而且從單純的色彩中，易於表現物體複難的色彩而成為一種明暗不同的調子。所以一張好的西洋畫，應該有堅實的素描技巧估根處，這不論在古大寒或現在的作家的作品上，隨時都可以證明的。</p>
<p>有素描基礎的作品，它對於施用色彩時便有着凖確的調子，所謂調子，就是包括明暗強弱與輕重，我們欣賞一幅好的洋畫，會覺得調子支配的得當，某一部分與某一部分的照映是和諧的，呼應的，絕無生硬突元的感覺。</p>
<p>關於洋畫上的色彩，在文藝復興期意大利的威尼期派的作風上，是特別考究，這一種風格而影響到隔了二個世紀的法蘭西的浪漫主義，正如當年重形式與智巧的翡冷翠派而影響到十九世紀的古典主義一樣；自然主義的色彩，是後起的印象主義的色光研究的暗示者，它雖然沒有像印象主義者的科學的地考究色彩，然而也知道了色彩的變幻是日光的推移。印象主義者國為受了這一個影響，所以對於色彩的選用是如何的開心，馬內（C.Monet）的連作「睡蓮」「稻草堆」等，可以說貫澈了自然主義的企圖，畫面上充滿了日光之下色彩感覺。新印象主義者則更作澈底的色彩研究，他們分析日光，否定陰影，注意色與色的照映，結果便用簡單的原色細點來描寫變幻莫測的日光，所謂「點彩派」，不在調色板上調色而確在眼睛內網膜上調色，這是科學發達的結果，也何甞不是洋畫上色彩施用最進步的方法呢？二十世紀的新與牆畫的色彩，是更研究得深切了，我們想在另一篇文字裏來講它。</p>
<p>洋畫的重要條件是寫實，在技法上考究素描與色彩，甚至於要研究物體遠近的透視法，人體的解剖等，可說都是為了實實的原故。然而單靠物體二部分的寫實而不把物體很巧妙的安排在畫面上，便失却藝術的意味，所以欣賞洋畫，還得注意畫面的構圖，也就是物體的適當安排與布置</p>
<p>最好的安排方法，是均衡，就是使物體在畫面之上，不覺得那一面多或少，這在色彩的支配上也要注意的，那就是調子的問題。</p>
<p>在構圖上，我們還要注意一幅畫面上，應該有一個中心，其他的東西，就應該歸向中心，不過不能失之呆板或雜亂，最好的例，便是文西的「最後之晚餐」的構圖，我們應該體味到這位藝人支配十三個人在這畫現上得到「變化而統一」的要則的苦心。</p>
<p>最後，我們還應該注意到材料的運用，油畫是厚重的，然而厚塗與薄塗，其效果是完全兩樣的，水彩有輕快明朗的趣味，色粉是縹渺的趣味。關於筆技，如平塗，團塊，點描，以及粗大的綫，平滑的面，其效果是各異的，在欣賞洋畫時，我們也應該注意一下。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血181</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「用不着費那們大事」。雞見新口說，「這玩意兒，我雖沒有經過深告，初步知識還懂一點。萍子還是我手下的敗半咧」。鶴見乘此又把在松島海浜，各萍子門法（玄術）的一段光景，簡略說明了。</p>
<p>「看樣子，這位萍子小姐抗拒能力不算大，——媑既然是青木的成熟媒介，我親二位老兄的心電，很容易傳達過去。……最要緊的，還是施李的時間——必是她在精神衰弱或体息的時間才好一　　來君也是內行。</p>
<p>W君的話說完，我們四個人都相視一笑，通莫明其妙的虎城，受了我們這一笑的影響，也胡塗地跟着笑了。</p>
<p>我們細心斟酌了一下，揀定在清晨三點鐘左右，實施這個計劃；內為突懸在午夜零時完成，休息兩小時，晟兩點到三點佈置行術的各項條件。不過我因軍務倥傯，瑣事稟六，把精神統一的條養功課，放棄了不少時日；這次舉動，確有行險僥倖的意味。為什麼說是行險呢？因為我們反出的心電，要是受了對方的抗拒，甚或發被對方的精神，強烈探制了，我們的精神就要受到很大的影響。說得可怕一點，我和觀見的神經呆，都可能受傷；輕則成功週期性的頭薄，重則我們兩個人，都得上瘋去了。</p>
<p>綜計今天這一晚，我們所商討的計劃，一共分成三個半步驟進行：一，八至九時，鶴見單身出伐，到北平行動總部，採聽敵情之外，還要「假傳聖旨」，揑造一個近衛的密令，「攻心為上」的措置。</p>
<p>這個辦法以，就是兩才鶴見所計劃的「瞞天過海」方式。用意即在替北平一帶的老百姓，建築一座何護城；省得我們舉行突擊之後，老百姓因而遭到「殃及池魚」的屠殺。</p>
<p>這個辦法行得通嗎？松井酒井這一類的東西，背後有松蘭梅及黑龍會的撐腰，首把鶴見個人的密電放在心上？殊不知其中還蔽着一個小佈置，鶴見在八點以前，就得把北平的形勢，半真半價的擬上一通報告，由參謀本部，轉給近衛，就說北平的遠征「皇軍」，正在計劃屠城。屠城這舉，也許是虛擬，但無端把許多「不穩份子」提禁起來，是個事實。同時勸近衛命令松井，負責收抬人心。</p>
<h3>談書箋</h3>
<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>紙之小而緊貴者曰箋，歐美男女人士之廠書，用以帖入開卷第一面之書箋輒揭本人姓名，即使接上「自某審樓而出　Ex　libris」之臘丁文，其物英字名書牌　Book-Plate，恒如吾華不刻時美績紛藻繪，非若綫裝古籍卷面標籤之有字無圖。予生平周壓請代表團，妙緒殊珍，窮搜博采，所藏所見，有騰於走馬看花之鑄。而其足彰歐美印刷術與藝事之特長者，自以『戰箋『一物為最名貴。西方社會一書箋，設計之書葉繪圖製版之成本與工夫，動逾十數鎊之英金。後此十七十八兩世紀，習慣思想，未脫中古世之樊龍，名流巨室之書箋，限用固有之家微，別無引人入勝之新意匠。最近百年之世界交通，愈形發達，事業學術，極五花八門之奇；書箋變化，漫無止境，一次所印，少則千張，而多至盈萬，一箋所佔紙幅，略如中國之圖章，其最大者，長可十一公分而寬至七公分，最小者縱橫各二公分，所施圖書文字，有如下之各例證。有將姓名之冠首字母，穿插成警句，略如中國人獨擅其長之嵌字聯者。例如荷國著名出版家Albert　Willcm　Sijt-hoff側戶之書箋，於本書所有權之下，綴以「Altijdt　Waeck-saem時深警惕」之箴，堪共「夕陽山色橫危險檻，佳日晴光上小樓」之夕佳樓七言聯，東西媲美。又一西人之姓曰兎馳Hazeloop.，其書箋繪一疾馳之兎，其題云：「願此書速歸原主，有如脫兎之飛馳，（如圖一）又一書箋之上賣書廚，中間缺置一書，似剛被他人取去，文曰「我之書廚中正缺此審」。此便閱舊者見圖領悟，及早將偕閱之吾歸還原主。又一書箋，亦實缺漏未消　補之書廚，（如圖二）題句云，「還我比書，速送A.R.Bake標某，假使不還，內心安否？」精心獨造，寄趣橫生。其書箋之揭舉本人族姓成圖者，則如　氏Wijs　所有書；圖作橡智蒸之貓頭鷹。（如圖三）冬生Wintrink氏所有書，圖作雪滿風狂之冬景，（如圖四）雀氏Mus所有書，圖作嗓枝之樓離，（如圖五）其書箋之表現民族特質者，如生命之樹及雙鹿，乃日耳曼種歷史傳統之一種標識，（見圖六）予意中華史蹟莫盛於漢唐，如有人紀漢族之光榮，似宜圖寫漢武帝期李廣利將軍得自西征之千里馬，此項書標，遇李姓之任武職者，尤屬相宜。者代表一種學術或一職事之書箋，如書代表醫業之蛇，並於心臟形之輪廓內，容納顯懲鏡，一望如有此書之人為醫師。如書衣道袍之理官，其前立一被控　淚之女郎，一望知有此書之人為律師，（如圖七及圖八）。如卷帙盈漫籤購紛互於几案（見圖九），一望知有此書之為圖書館專家。中國如為圖書主任製書箋，似宜圖寫曾任柱下史之太上老君，終之書箋有關本人涉歷與嗜尚者，則如無漢時仙同姓之世界環遊航海家，可書月中丹桂闊斧與樓船，如泅泳之女性，可如予之細草虛廓，滿布花光與鳥影矣，（見圖十）。</p>
<h3>記张書旂　十分天才　十分努力</h3>
<p>— 許士骥</p>
<p>第十七次，文藝茶话會在南京冠生園舉行，文藝界同道，濟濟一堂，來觀迎新近由美載譽返國當代花島畫大家張書旂教授。回溯六年以前，正當我國抗戰最艱苦的時期，書旂受命赴美，考察藝術，舉行個人書展，部在國民外交的立場，宣揚中土藝術，替中華民族出了一口氣，這是值得贊美的</p>
<p>中國半世紀以來。在科學上所培養的人才，何止千萬，所費的代價，不可勝計，科學家的貢獻不能說沒有，可是科學化工業化電氣化等等　，只聽樓梯響，不見人下來，當然原因複雜，要談到發明和創造，在實事上表現出來，雖非空中樓閣，但也渺若神仙。我敢大膽地武斷說一句，在國際上稍露頭角，而能爭一席地的，還要算敬陪末座的文藝作家罷。書旂就是當中的一個。</p>
<p>他在旅美六年當中，舉行了數十次個人國畫展覧，在華盛頓，芝加哥，紐約，波司頓費，勞德菲，舊金山。以及加拿大的多倫多，諸大城市，縱橫南北美大陸，應各大學，各美術館，及博物院邀請，同時演講中國美術，並對各揮毫，運用他精煉的技巧，疾如風雨，頃刻即成。循邦人士，驚奇贊美，嘆為神乎其技，各報標題「傑作完成十分鐘」（A.Cninese　Masterpiece　in　Iominites）他的成功並非偶然，正如大發明家愛迪生的名言，「一分天才還要靠九十九分的努力」，何況他真有十分的天才，再加上十分的努力。</p>
<p>中國花島畫，導源於唐五代，發揮於宋，變化於元，集大成於明清；惟明清畫人，承五代兩宋之餘緒，步前人規範，殊少創意。</p>
<p>書旂作畫，師法造物，深入自然，「匠心獨運」，工寫兼能，突破古人藩離，而能獨張一幟；其造詣與成功，實東方藝苑，放一異彩。</p>

<h3>衰敗潦倒的島集</h3>
<p>— 珠光</p>
<p>養鳥，卅年前士大夫們為了表現其「風雅」而爭相競尚的這個玩意兒，現在除了西藏路東方飯店門前那個圓廣場上的鳥集，浙江路一言樓茶館店樓上的茶會，和五馬路上十敗家掛滿着竹籠子的鳥店，這三者還賸有「風雅」的跡而外，這當年盛極一世成為一時風尚的玩意兒，簡直已經被近人忘懷了。</p>
<p>五馬路浙江路一帶，毗連櫛此的排列着，這麼十廿家鳥舖，從搬到這渠裏來之後，他們這一行的黃金時代早已過去了，據一位老年的鳥行主人語記者：他們的全盛期是在卅年以前，那時候南市城皇廟九曲橋一帶，是他們的大本營，不論達官巨富，公館裏不養這麼數十乃至數百隻五顏六色的飛禽，是不足以表示他們的權顯和風雅的。那時節，梢為像樣些的大戶人家，還得雇用專事飼養鳥類的鳥夫呢。</p>
<p>「現在的情形可不同了」這位長者不勝滄桑地說：「有錢人都不喜愛玩這一套了。取而代之的是收音機，電影院和跳舞場。沒錢的呢，這年頭連飯也吃不飽，那來這許多閒情逸緻再來玩鳥！」在充滿着怅惘的情绪之下，他下了一个结論，說是「这日子呀，鳥也遭了殃啦！」</p>
<p>說起鳥，照老玩鳥的專家說來，真是五花八門，名目繁多。有所謂文鳥，如芙蓉，綉眼（因眼圈有黑白綫條一如繡成者，故名），相思鳥，十姊妹（身驅精小，色澤美故名）梅花等等有所謂武鳥，如畫眉，百靈，乃至好鬥善戰的黃頭。此外，有安南產的料哥（嬰鵡之一種，性極靈敏，善學人語）小嬰鵡，百哥，麻雀，鴿子等等，同時，每類都有九幾種的分別，單以芙蓉而言，就有翻反芙蓉，荷蘭芙蓉乃至蛇頭芙蓉，真是五光十色美不勝收。</p>
<h3>表面工作</h3>
<p>— 金靈</p>
<p>一般人都非議我們的行政官太少重表面工作，其實能夠實實在在的注重表面工作已夠好了，恐怕是連表面工作也做不像樣。日昨報載：蔣主席在中樞紀念週上對首都市政予以斥責謂：「大家不注意公共衛生，到處小便，不過秩序，首都不像首都，致為外人所看不起。不知社會部衛生署及市政府所司何事？」這的確夠給那個連表面工作也幹不好的很大的打擊了。</p>
<p>奇怪的是：當去年蔣主席勝利後初次飛臨首都時，當局在當日就動員大批人馬修築馬路，打掃街道，到處是光輝的標語和旗幟，南京城突然的生動起來。但是現在國民政府還都將近一年，蔣主席長駐南京，而表面工作不但沒有澈底完成，反而是「到處小便」，「首都不像首都」了，難道所謂表面工作，也只是湊一時的熱鬧嗎？</p>
<p>因此我以為表面工作，也不能厚非，因為一個憔悴的病夫，不論穿着怎樣華麗的衣服，終遮不住他面黃肌瘦的可憐相的，身體壯健的人，肌肉發達，膚色紅潤，雖然不怎樣修飾，外表上看起來也必然是非常美麗的，行政工作也是如此。真正是一個公僕，難道會忽視小街僻巷的潔淨，損害民衆的健康嗎？</p>
<h3>抗告</h3>
<p>— 子蜂</p>
<p>物價狂漲潮中，本市的社會局長吳開光，堅主要實行配給制，方能穩定公教人員等生活，而逐漸使物價平抑。這方案果然給政府所採納了，並將在三月中正式實施。至於配給的東西，計開有：米，麵，粉，紗布，燃料，食鹽，食糖，食油等數種，都是每人生活的必需品。</p>
<p>但是配給的範圍，郤衹限「公教」人員，「私教」及「社教」（文化界）却一概例外。呌前些日子眼巴巴望着，以為也可得到配給的私校教職員，以及文化從業員大大的感到了失望。</p>
<p>其實教育人員是同為國家作育人材，文化人員更是艱苦地推行着社會教育，生活的清苦是絕不下於一般公務人員及公立學校的教職員的。然而，其所受到國家的待遇，郤如此地不同……。</p>
<p>我們於此，謹敢提出抗告！</p>
<h3>巧立名目的學雜費</h3>
<p>— 知真</p>
<p>苛捐雜稅衹少也得有個名目，「巧立名目」也就成了「貪官污吏」的專長了。</p>
<p>我們不敢說瑞在的學校已經貪污化了，但是，衹少現在許多的學校已經沾染了「巧立名目」的惡習。市參議會訂下了私立中小學收費的標凖，中小學的校長們雖然在報上刊登了堂皇的抗議書，但是礙於市教育局務必遵守的命令，也就默然了。於是，有一家中學在高中學生繳費單寫着：「本學期應繳各費如下：學費二十二萬元（依照市參議會規定），雜費七萬元，衛生費一萬元，賠償保證金一萬元。」雜費幾乎是學費的三分之一而「學雜費」竟超過了學費的三分之一。</p>
<p>私立大學當局深悔校長會議如開關於漲風之前，以致「學雜費最高五十萬元」的標凖訂得太低（？），為了「亡羊補牢」起見，在五十萬的「學雜費」之外，再放上圖書費二萬元，體育費一萬元，講義費……。</p>
<p>就說公立學校吧，一個在市立××中學肄業的初中學生，他的家長除了要繳納二萬元學費和八萬元雜費之外，還得負担「暫收教職員學術進修費」，「補充修置費」等「雜費」一共八萬五千元——比「名正言順」的雜費還要多！</p>
<p>我不懂雜費的涵義如何？從學校的繳費單中看來，似乎僅漏植了房租，水電等零星的雜用，難道在繳費總額中佔如此巨大的比例的雜費，僅是用以支付這些零星的費用嗎？這好像太說不過去了。</p>
<p>教員當局曾經規定教職員的薪津，佔學費總額的百分比，現在教師不能怪薪津菲薄了，因為「學費」收得少呀——雜費與「雜雜費」的支用，教師照例是無權過問的。</p>
<p>講究衛生，必須清潔；有了體育，怎能忘掉訓育；教職員生活不安定，談不上學術進修……。我想，不久學校的繳費單上又該增刊：「清潔費」，「訓育費」，「教職員生活補助費」……了。</p>

<p>至於老虎們，他們是誰？是在那里？這倒說不定，或是遁入了深谷，或是遠走於絕峯，或是隱身於草澤，一經再度出現時，還是照常吃人！</p>

<h3>Successful Pursuit in Eastern Henan and Western Shandong; Ningling and Yuncheng Recovered; Attack on Qihar by Communist Troops Repelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 22nd] Military sources report that on the 21st, the National Army in eastern Henan completed another powerful counter-offensive, achieving major victories. Ningling and Qiao counties were recovered on the morning of the 22nd. Furthermore, over 3,000 Communist troops in western Henan had previously stirred up trouble along the Xin'an and Mianchi railway lines, attempting to disrupt the security of the Haixi section. After days of concerted attacks by the National Army, they were unable to carry out their railway sabotage plans and fled across the north bank of the Yellow River on the night of the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The National Army in western Shandong recovered Yuncheng at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. The Communist troops fled north across the Yellow River. The mopping-up operation in the triangular area between the Yellow River and the Grand Canal in western Shandong has now come to an end.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The pursuit in western Shandong is progressing smoothly. A certain National Army brigade, advancing from Juye and Jiaxiang in three routes to pursue the remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in Yuncheng, has linked up with another National Army unit after crossing Yuncheng, forming an encirclement of Yuncheng. The Communist troops in Yuncheng are fleeing north in disarray.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] According to a war correspondent from this newspaper accompanying the pursuing troops in western Shandong, the National Army's offensive in western Shandong quickly recovered Juye and Jiaxiang, leaving the Communist troops no time to coerce innocent civilians. Three million refugees on the brink of starvation have been rescued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The National Army recovered Dancheng, southwest of Luyi, on the 20th. The Communist forces under Wei Fenglou fled northwest of the county, possibly to join forces with Zhang Taisheng's troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Over 1,000 Communist troops in the Yucheng and Yancheng areas of northern Shandong launched an attack on Qihar outside Jinan on the night of the 21st. By the morning of the 22nd, they had been repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>Communist Troops' Breakout from Mountainous Areas Blocked; Fierce Fighting Continues North of Xintai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The focus of the war in Shandong Province has now shifted to central Shandong, the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The Communist forces invading Laiwu and Tushikou have increased to over 50,000 on the 22nd. In the 50-kilometer area north of Xintai to Qingshiguan, fierce fighting has raged for the past two days, resulting in heavy Communist casualties. In addition, over 10,000 Communist troops are now advancing from west of Mengyin towards Tai'an. The Communist forces' intention is clearly to cut the Jiaoji Railway and threaten Jinan. There have been no changes in the fighting in southern Shandong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Communist troops attempting to break out from the northern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains were still being intercepted by the National Army in the Azhuang area (5 kilometers north of Tushikou) on the 22nd. The fighting is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Communist troops south of the Yellow River have reached their last days. News this morning indicates that the remnants of the Communist New 1st Division and the 2nd Security Brigade, fleeing towards Tushikou north of Laiwu, have been defeated by the National Army and are being annihilated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] After retreating from Xintai, the National Army in southern Shandong has joined up with another National Army unit, completing a counter-encirclement on the Laiwu-Xintai line. Another powerful mobile force of the National Army is increasing pressure on the Sishui line, where the remnants of Chen Yi's forces are concentrated. Therefore, the Communist troops that have once again infiltrated Xintai have essentially re-entered a trap. According to military observers speaking to reporters, if Chen Yi's remnants do not repent and surrender as soon as possible, even if they avoid annihilation, they will starve to death in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong, where no grain remains.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] On the 22nd, the central Shandong battle continued to focus on the triangular area between Laiwu, Tushikou, and Azhuang (10 kilometers south of Boshan). The combat zone has extended to the Hei Yu and Dazhai areas north of Tushikou and the Qingshiguan area southwest of Boshan. Fierce fighting raged all night on the 21st. The situation in Dazhai, Hei Yu, Azhuang, and Qingshiguan is unclear. At this time, the National Army in the Xintai area, due to the overly exposed position of their front lines, retreated and concentrated in Laiwu city, bravely blocking the invading Communist troops. However, the Communist forces continue to increase in strength, and the intensity of the siege is unprecedented, making the situation in the city extremely serious. As for the Communist troops attempting to support this front, attacking Zhangdian, the Jinling Towns east and west, and the Mashang railway stations from the night of the 20th, after being repelled, only carried out disruptive attacks on the night of the 21st and the morning of the 22nd, which have been repelled. Furthermore, due to the excessive damage to the communication equipment along the Jiaoji Railway, the extent of the damage to the railway on the night of the 21st could not be determined immediately, and passenger trains continued to be suspended on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] The prelude to the central Shandong battle has begun. Fierce battles broke out simultaneously along the Jiaoji Railway and in Pi County in eastern Shandong on the night of the 20th, with the Communist forces using up to nine divisions, five brigades, and local units, totaling over 100,000 troops. The National Army is also resisting with all its might, and the fighting is fierce, the first such intensity since Linqu. The National Army in Yexian in eastern Shandong, due to the exposed position of their front lines, has been ordered to withdraw. After fierce fighting, Shahe Town was also abandoned on the 22nd, while intense fighting continues in Huipu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] According to statistics from the Bureau regarding the sections of the Jiaoji Railway damaged by Communist troops from the 20th to 4:00 PM on the 22nd, 28 sections of track were destroyed, along with 7 bridges and 5 kilometers of telecommunications lines. The damage between Zhangdian and Yangjiazhuang (east of Yidu) was the most severe. The Zhangdian-Jinan section was repaired and reopened to traffic by 3:30 PM on the 22nd. Based on the current situation, direct special trains between Jinan and Qingdao will probably not be able to operate in the short term.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Harass Southern Hebei; Long Interception Trenches Dug at Nanyuan Airport</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Over 20,000 Communist troops infiltrated Panggezhuang in southern Hebei yesterday. Long interception trenches have been dug at Nanyuan Airport since yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Over 10,000 Communist troops infiltrated near Weishanzhuang on the Beiping-Tianjin line yesterday, attempting to seize the station. Anping, north of the midpoint of the Beiping-Tianjin highway to Matouzhen, has recently been occupied by Communist troops again, disrupting travel and commerce.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Chenpu Town, northwest of Zhuoxian on the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway, was captured by Communist troops. Over 20,000 Communist troops arrived in that area. A brigade also infiltrated 30 li southwest of Dusi yesterday. A brigade arrived 5 kilometers southeast of Laishui, cutting off the Yilai and Laiyi highways to isolate Laishui. Communist troops also carried out sabotage between Songlin and Gaobeidian last night and reinforced Mancheng by separate routes, attempting to defend it to the death.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Shares His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Expresses Determination to Open the Baoding-Shijiazhuang Section</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Sun Lianzhong's leg ailment is gradually improving after electrotherapy, and he can already walk around the house. He is expected to resume office in a week. Sun met with reporters at his private residence at 10:00 AM on the 20th and spoke for an hour. He stated that the Eleventh War Zone is determined to open the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway, but the Communist troops only suffered a loss of one-third of their strength after the battle of Yaocun, so the security of the Beiping-Baoding section is still difficult to ensure. Sun then recounted his thoughts over the past year, stating that military and political affairs in Hebei Province can be divided into two periods: the first eight months after the victory were spent handling the reception of prisoners of war, and the military and political work gradually began to unfold in the following eight months. However, eastern Hebei had just been recovered when troops were transferred to the Ping-Sui Railway due to the battle of Zhangjiakou, which later led to insufficient troop strength, the failure to restore order in central Hebei, and the inability to ensure traffic on the Ping-Bao line. As a native of Hebei, he felt ashamed to face his hometown, but he had a clear conscience towards the government.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Tong County Magistrate</h3>
<p>Zhou Kefeng Sent to Military Law Supervision Department</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] After Tong County was briefly captured by Communist troops on the 9th of this month, Commander Sun Lianzhong was extremely angry and personally ordered an investigation of Zhou Kefeng, the magistrate of Tong County. Huang Rencai, the commissioner of the 5th Administrative Region in charge, also requested disciplinary action. Huang carried Sun's order to Tong County today and convened a review meeting with representatives from the local party, government, military, civilian, and group organizations in the county. They unanimously condemned the county magistrate for his responsibility to defend the territory and believed that he deserved punishment. However, it was pointed out that it was indeed difficult for 330 militiamen to defend a city wall 12 li in circumference. Zhou also stated that he should not bear legal and moral responsibility. Zhou accompanied Commissioner Huang to Beiping that day and was sent to the Military Law Supervision Department. Wang Wenxuan, the newly appointed magistrate of Tong County, also took office today. The Fifth Administrative Region office will be relocated to Tong County soon.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist Representatives from Northern Rehe Petition the Shenyang Authorities</h3>
<p>Communist Troops Flee from Dolon to the Mountains</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] Li Erhang, Tala Shan, Wang Antian, Ba Zai, and other representatives of the anti-Communist petition groups from various counties in northern Rehe, consisting of both Mongolians and Han Chinese, came to Shenyang to petition the authorities to recover northern Rehe as soon as possible. Tala Shan is deeply respected by the Mongolian and Han people of northern Rehe. He sacrificed livestock, temples, and property, and led 1,200 local troops to resist the Communist forces. He and Wang Antian and other representatives of a million people from seven counties and six banners have come to Shenyang to petition and are willing to be at the forefront.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 22nd] After the cavalry regiment under the Second Pacification Zone of Rehe entered Dolon, local security has gradually stabilized. The Communist troops have repeatedly failed to intrude. Recently, they have scattered in small groups and fled to the mountainous areas in the northwest and southeast.</p>
<h3>CCP Yan'an Headquarters Calls for Mobilization in Border Region</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] The CCP Yan'an headquarters is currently calling for the full mobilization of the people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region to cope with future crises. Its slogans are "Open up the Eastern Route" and "Open up the Northern Route." Since the middle of this month, it has been concentrating its forces in the Yongning and Shenzhang areas, attempting to invade Fenyang again and encircle Taiyuan. Heavy troop concentrations are also reported in Mizhi, northern Shaanxi, suggesting a possible attack on Yulin.</p>
<h3>Tang Enbo Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Tang Enbo flew back to Nanjing from Zhengzhou at 5:00 PM on the 22nd. Tang spent nearly ten days touring Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and other places after departing from Nanjing. When reporters asked Tang about his impressions of this trip, Tang only said that prices in various places were lower than in Nanjing. Regarding the purpose of his trip, he said, "I was just visiting friends."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Zhu Kejing, the Lieutenant General Secretary-General of the Political Department of Chen Yi's Communist forces, was captured in southern Shandong and escorted to Nanjing on the 22nd. His secretary Huang Yisheng, Chief of the General Affairs Section Liu Yongqing, and two unnamed political officers were also escorted along with him. Zhu is a native of Liling, Hunan, 50 years old, and a graduate of the Soviet Eastern University. He has been engaged in political work with the Communist forces for many years. When reporters visited him, he was leaning against the wall, absorbed in reading the editorial "The Communist Party Lays Down Its Arms" in the Central Daily News. When asked about his thoughts, he only gave a bitter smile and did not answer. He then recounted his academic and professional experiences. When he spoke of the Communist forces harming the people, this "old comrade," who considers himself to be reforming the government and education, could not help but feel ashamed.</p>

<h3>Minister Bai to Fly to Beiping Tomorrow; To Attend North China Pacification and Political Review Meeting; First Group of Supervision Team to Depart for Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The North China Pacification Zone Political Review Meeting will be held in Beiping on the 25th. Minister Bai Chongxi is scheduled to arrive in Beiping the day before the meeting. Gu Zhenggang is expected to return to Beiping from Rehe at 5:00 PM on the 23rd. People from Hebei Province have decided to petition the review meeting to designate the entire Hebei Province as a Pacification Zone, following the example of Shandong. Of the 137 counties in Hebei, the original designated Pacification Zone included 44 counties, and then 8 counties were added, for a total of 52 counties. Hebei gentry argue that Communist troops are active in every county in Hebei, and not a single county has fully restored order. Therefore, they request that all counties be designated as Pacification Zones (according to the designation of Pacification Zones, each county can receive 400 million in disaster relief and agricultural loans). At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, the Hebei Native Place Association, the Hebei Rehabilitation Promotion Association, and other three groups held a meeting and decided to recommend Lu Zhonglin, Li Peiyi, and Gu Zhongxi to negotiate with Ministers Bai and Gu.

<h3>Ten Types of Constitutional Legal Regulations to Be Reviewed by Legislative Yuan Soon; Police Regulations Also Completed and Awaiting Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The ten types of legal regulations related to constitutional rule, after being discussed at the National Defense Committee meeting on the 19th, were sent to the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 22nd. The Constitutional Law and Regulations Committee of the Legislative Yuan will conduct group reviews next week. The entire process is expected to be completed before the end of March. Furthermore, according to the new constitution, the internal organization of the Judicial Yuan will also be changed. The Judicial Yuan recently held a meeting to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The draft election law for National Assembly representatives and the election law for legislators, which have already been completed, have the following allocation of seats: the total number of National Assembly representatives is 2,912, with 2,130 seats allocated to counties and cities, 450 seats for professional representatives, and the remainder for border minority ethnic groups, etc. The total number of legislators is 565, with the largest number allocated to Sichuan (49 seats), followed by Jiangsu (38 seats), Guangdong (33 seats), and the smallest number allocated to Xikang (only 4 seats).</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The police law drafted by the police authorities has recently been completed and is undergoing preliminary review. It will soon be submitted to the National Defense Committee and then to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, after which it can be implemented. Its contents include the determination of the police system and the fundamental laws for police agencies at all levels to perform their duties.</p>
<h3>Initial Draft of Banking Law to Be Submitted to Legislative Yuan for Review Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The initial draft of the banking law has been drafted by legislator Zhang Zhaoyuan and will be submitted for review soon. The entire draft is divided into the following chapters: (1) Definitions, (2) General Provisions, (3) Regulations, (4) Commercial Banks, (5) Industrial Banks, (6) Savings Banks, (7) Trust Banks, (8) Money Shops, (9) Pawnshops, (10) Foreign Banks, (11) Registration Fees, (12) Supplementary Provisions, totaling 180 to 200 articles. The biggest difference between this draft and the previous banking law and the draft proposed by the Ministry of Finance is that the Ministry of Finance's draft does not include commercial banks, and money shops are also under internal jurisdiction. The new draft contains detailed regulations on savings banks and trust banks. Furthermore, the draft contains explicit regulations on bank regulations, for example, the Ministry of Finance may not issue any laws or regulations without legal basis. Another feature is that banks will be able to compete freely and be eliminated freely without restrictions in the future.</p>
<h3>Legislators Sun and Mei Discuss Production Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Previously, it was reported that the "Financial, Economic, and Commercial Law Report" of the nine-member subcommittee of the Finance, Economics, and Commercial Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan. Legislators Sun Jiulu and Mei Shuzeng told reporters that this report had not been approved by the general assembly and was purely a private publication. They also believed that when discussing the issue of gold and US dollars in this report, attributing the surge in gold and US dollars to production loans was a far-fetched argument. The two further stated that the current Chinese industry is not yet able to stand on its own, so how can it be destroyed again? At a time when private funds are flocking to speculation, if the government authorities do not provide factories with loans for relief, then the factories will inevitably collapse completely. If we talk about stabilizing prices, if we have no production ourselves and rely solely on dumping foreign goods, it is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. To say that production loans have caused the surge in gold and US dollars is also impossible in reality, because the factories were too busy taking care of themselves last year to worry about other things. Therefore, this claim seems to refute itself.</p>

<h3>The United States, France, and Britain Agree with Our Position; Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Not Discuss China's Problems</h3>

This statement has been entrusted to the US government by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be notified to the participating countries during the Foreign Ministers' Conference. When interviewed by reporters on the 22nd, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied that our country had recently made a statement entrusting the US to raise the matter at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but said that our country had previously sent a note to the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, stating: (1) According to the Potsdam Agreement and the precedent of signing treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland, the entire procedure for negotiating peace with Germany and Austria should first be decided by the five foreign ministers at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. (2) The convocation and organization of the German and Austrian peace conferences should be jointly decided by the five countries.

Any changes should also be subject to China's consent. The above note has been sent out for some time and not only to the United States alone. After this statement was sent out, the United States, France, and Britain have recently sent replies, expressing their agreement with the position declared by our side. When asked by reporters what steps our country would take if the conference involved Chinese issues, even though the three countries had replied in this way, he replied that the minority could not force the majority, and he believed that such a situation would not occur. When asked by reporters whether our country would send "observers" to attend since it had not been selected to participate, he replied that our ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chuan Bingchang, might attend.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Dalian; Large Numbers of Locomotives Being Transported Away on the China Changchun Railway; 50,000 Communist Troops Gather North of Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] The Dalian Shipyard has been destroyed. Sixty locomotives of the China Changchun Railway have also been transported to Vladivostok by Soviet ships. Soviet troops in Liushutun near Dalian are also withdrawing. It seems that the Soviet troops intend to complete the withdrawal before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10th to avoid criticism from other Allied countries. Therefore, the Dalian issue, which has attracted worldwide attention, seems to be on the way to resolution.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] Soviet troops in the Liaodong Peninsula may completely withdraw to Lushun before March 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] The Soviet Union has obtained our consent to establish a consulate general in Shenyang. It is heard that we have also agreed on the candidate for Consul General.

<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] There are about 50,000 Communist troops north of Dalian, with sufficient ammunition and good equipment. They own two arsenals and have seized a large amount of materials to be transported. This is actually a supply base for the Southern Liaoning and Shandong and Hebei military regions.

<p>Harbin's Economy Plunges into a Vortex of Collapse; Prices Soar and Stores Close Down</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun 22nd Dispatch] Harbin City has fallen into an economic collapse under the surge of the Communist Army's "Northeast Bank Notes". According to a merchant from Harbin recently, the price of grain in Harbin has broken the 70 yuan per catty mark for sorghum. Major stores are also closing down one after another due to liquidation struggles. The "Northeast Trade Bureau", which controls the entire economy of Songbei, has established five companies in Harbin City, including Minsheng and Harbin, to monopolize the purchase of all daily necessities. The actual value of the puppet Manchukuo hundred yuan currency has surged. One hundred yuan of Manchukuo currency can now be exchanged for two hundred yuan of "Northeast Bank Notes". Therefore, the paper money issued by the Communist Army has depreciated sharply in Songbei and the speed of circulation is increasing daily. Prices are soaring, with cigarettes being twice as expensive as in Changchun, and coarse cloth costing 400-500 yuan per foot. The people's livelihood is declining and has reached its peak. The merchant also said that the Communist Army is currently arresting and transporting more than 10,000 unemployed people in Harbin to the north for unknown purposes. Also, the park on Still Tenth Street, which has been called the "People's Slaughterhouse" of Harbin for years, has added more than 2,000 new corpses since the New Year. At the beginning of this month, he witnessed a young intellectual of about 20 years old being executed in the park's ditch under the charge of being a "Central Beard".</p>
<h3>Our Official Sources Cite Specific Facts Condemning the Philippines' Anti-Chinese Policy; Inconstancy Leads to the Stalling of Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] When a Central News Agency reporter inquired about the current relationship between China and the Philippines, the anti-Chinese measures of the Philippine Congress, and the recent stalling of Sino-Philippine negotiations, our official sources unanimously expressed regret over the recent anti-Chinese attitude of the Philippine government.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Make Great Contributions</p>
<p>When meeting with reporters, official sources stated that there was no legitimate reason for the Philippine government's anti-Chinese policy, saying that the efforts of overseas Chinese in the Philippines over the decades have made great contributions to the development and prosperity of the Philippine Islands. During the Japanese occupation, not only did the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Philippines suffer great losses, but also many overseas Chinese joined the Philippine guerrilla forces to fight side by side. They made considerable sacrifices and contributions to the liberation of the Philippines and the common victory of the Allied countries. The Chinese people felt sincere joy at the birth of the Republic of the Philippines and the achievement of complete independence, and earnestly hoped that the birth of this new nation would enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and the Philippines. However, the realization of this hope seems to have been delayed due to the attitude of the Philippine government.</p>
<p>Only Overseas Chinese are Affected</p>
<p>When reporters continued to inquire about the specific facts of the Philippine government's anti-Chinese policy, they learned the following: (1) The Filipino Labor Bill in the Philippine Congress forces overseas Chinese to employ Filipinos to account for 60% of all employees. (2) The Filipino Retailer Bill in the Philippine Congress will make it impossible for overseas Chinese retailers to survive. (3) The quota for Chinese immigrants to the Philippines was already too low, and there is now a plan to reduce it by nine-tenths of the original number. Finally, there is the Filipino Hawker Bill passed by the Philippine Congress, which will seize all the stalls of overseas Chinese hawkers and give them to Filipinos. The implementation of this bill has been temporarily suspended only because the overseas Chinese filed a complaint in the Manila District Court. Official sources have repeatedly stated that allowing the establishment of stalls or refusing it is different from seizing stalls that have been operated by thousands of overseas Chinese for a long time. The establishment of overseas Chinese stalls has a long history, and they have been painstakingly managed to achieve their current scale. The livelihood of most overseas Chinese depends on this. The establishment of this bill will actually deprive overseas Chinese of their right to survive. Although the bill nominally applies to foreigners in general, only overseas Chinese are actually harmed. This kind of discrimination harms the interests of both China and the Philippines. What we should pay attention to is that this bill did not exist before the Philippine Islands became independent.</p>
<p>Do Not Understand the Philippine Attitude</p>
<p>Regarding the suspension of Sino-Philippine negotiations, official sources said that the Chinese government could not understand why the Philippine government adopted this attitude. The negotiation of this treaty had reached the stage where it could be signed. However, the Philippine government unexpectedly overturned all the agreed points and put forward proposals that were unrelated to and contradictory to the original case. Before the treaty is formally signed, it can be slightly modified. However, from the diplomatic practice of treaty making, clauses that have been agreed upon by both parties should not be proposed to be overturned without sufficient reason. Otherwise, agreeing today and overturning tomorrow is fickle, which will not only prevent negotiations from succeeding, but also make the other party embarrassed. Official sources believe that this action is inconsistent with the Philippine government's statement of hoping to promote Sino-Philippine relations. However, the Chinese government still hopes that the Philippine government can prove its goodwill with facts so that the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines can be protected and the negotiation of the Sino-Philippine treaty can be completed smoothly.</p>
<p>Philippine Cabinet Discusses Reply</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila 22nd Dispatch] Local Philippine official sources said that the Philippine government's reply to the first note from our Minister to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, may be submitted to the embassy today. It is said that the reply was discussed in yesterday's cabinet meeting, and the cabinet meeting fully supported it. Although the content of the reply has not been announced, it is generally believed that it will be consistent with the position taken by Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino in his statement to the press two days ago.</p>

<h3>US Liaison Group in Yan'an Decides to Withdraw on the 5th of Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping 22nd Dispatch] The US Liaison Group in Yan'an will also leave Yan'an on March 5th after the CCP personnel withdraw from Nanjing, Chongqing, and Shanghai. This withdrawal date was decided by Colonel Rumbaugh, director of the Liaison Group, and Colonel Walter, former US Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters. Walter flew to Yan'an with Hua Jian on the same plane yesterday. Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other CCP leaders welcomed them at the airport. Ye hosted Walter and his party for lunch. Mao Zedong did not attend but indicated that he could meet with the US personnel if they stayed overnight before returning to Beijing. According to US officers who returned to Beiping, the atmosphere in Yan'an is heavy and completely different from the optimistic atmosphere a year ago when Ye came to Beiping to take office as a member of the Executive Headquarters. Last November, most of the CCP agencies withdrew for fear of government troops attacking Yan'an. They have now returned, but the situation is still tense.</p>

<h3>Our Overseas Chinese in Hanoi Not Affected When Viet Minh Troops Withdraw; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Telegram Commending Consul General Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] Diplomatic news: When the Viet Minh troops withdrew from the Chinese-Vietnamese area of Hanoi, they did not damage the area in order to respect our neutrality, so overseas Chinese suffered almost no losses. Our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, had carefully planned in advance, and the order in the area was orderly, without any disturbances. The French military authorities also assisted in supplying the Chinese area with rice, water, medicine, and other items, and congratulated the Consul General on the success of the peaceful negotiations. Now that the various situations in the area have stabilized and there is no fear of accidents, it can return to normal. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs praised the Consul General for repeatedly risking entering and leaving the Chinese-Vietnamese area and negotiating with both France and Vietnam appropriately, so that the overseas Chinese in the area were spared from disaster, and sent a telegram to commend him.</p>
<h3>Canada to Repeal Chinese Immigration Act</h3>
<p>Currently Submitted to Parliament for Discussion</p>
<p>[United Press Ottawa 21st Dispatch] According to Canadian Prime Minister King, the Chinese Immigration Act passed in 1923 will be repealed. From now on, Chinese people in Canada will be treated the same as other Asians without racial discrimination. Everyone can be treated according to the ordinary regulations of the Immigration Act, and there will no longer be a special clause for Chinese people. However, it will still be considered an immigration bill by parliament. If passed, all Chinese people who have obtained Canadian citizenship, whose wives and unmarried children currently living in China are not allowed to reunite in Canada, will be allowed to enter.

<h3>UNRRA China Office Reveals Erroneous Information</h3>
<p>American Newspapers Write Articles Condemning It</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco 22nd Broadcast: Howard's newspaper recently condemned the erroneous report regarding the Chinese government's request to UNRRA to allow it to sell relief supplies on the black market, saying that the inaccurate information was revealed by the UNRRA China Office, whose staff have always been hostile to the Chinese government. The newspaper also said that the method of converting relief funds to purchase consumer goods and selling them to the public was suggested to the Chinese government by UNRRA staff, apparently out of dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Shanghai Office. The newspaper also accused totalitarian countries supported by the Soviet Union of selling relief supplies on the black market and using the proceeds to subsidize government expenditures, but UNRRA turned a blind eye. UNRRA subsidized the finances of some countries with "post-war relief" materials, while discriminating against other countries, China being a clear example.</p>

<p>Xie Yingzhou Talks in Hankou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 22nd Dispatch] Xie Yingzhou, Vice Minister of Justice, recently came to Hankou after inspecting the provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan. According to his speech, although Hunan Province suffered terrible destruction, the reconstruction and construction were enough to be the crown of the four provinces. The main driving force was that the relief supplies were mostly used for construction. For example, the Hunan Relief Sub-Administration allocated materials worth 2 billion to build four major prisons in Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, and Xiangtan, and allocated blankets and flour to the Changsha District Court Detention Center and the Ex-Prisoner Protection Association. Therefore, the prisoners in the prison all received blankets and nutritious products, and their food and clothing enjoyment was only seen by prisoners nationwide. Xie also said that although there may be some controversies in the distribution of materials, it is indeed an achievement to break the scope of passive relief and actively support construction.</p>

<h3>Students of Suzhou Provincial High School and Suzhou Women's Normal School Uphold Principal's Reputation, Smash Suzhou Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 22nd] The student self-governing associations of both Suzhou Provincial High School and Suzhou Women's Normal School, regarding the Suzhou Newspaper of this county for its erroneous report of the Provincial High School's principal embezzling public property and the Women's Normal School's principal's dictatorial behavior and dereliction of duty, are united in feeling that both individuals serve education with steadfastness and excellence, and have long been reputable. Now, they are falsely accused, arousing public indignation. As a protest, this afternoon, the 22nd, over three thousand people gathered simultaneously from both schools, organized into a procession, and gathered at the gate of the Suzhou Newspaper, quietly awaiting a response. Upon hearing the news, the Hongcheng Defense Department's military police and the police bureau rushed to appease them, so the initial order was well-maintained. However, as the person in charge of the Suzhou Newspaper was out on business, a quick resolution could not be reached. The students waited for approximately three hours, and their emotions became agitated. They smashed the Suzhou Newspaper's business department equipment and tore up some newsprint. Around 7 PM, they organized themselves and returned to their respective schools, shouting slogans along the way, causing onlookers to block the streets. Afterwards, our reporter visited both parties. School officials expressed deep regret over the damage caused by the delay. The Suzhou Newspaper officials are currently deliberating on the matter of liability for the aftermath. As the news had already been corrected, they will await instructions from the authorities for handling. It has been decided that the newspaper will be published as usual on the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Tragic Massacre Occurs in Chengde - Provincial Health Director Allegedly Held a Grudge Over Embezzlement Rumors - Shoots Deputy Director and Worker, Then Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 22nd] A tragic massacre occurred here last week. Dai Hongfu, Director of the Rehe Provincial Health Department, died by slitting his throat, Deputy Director Qiu Chongzhou was shot and injured, and a worker, Zhang, was shot and fatally wounded. There are conflicting accounts of the incident. According to reliable sources: Dai was from Andong, a graduate of Qilu Medical University. During the War of Resistance, he served as the director of a health station on the Yunnan-Burma Road. After the victory, he was appointed to his current position. Recently, there were rumors that Dai had embezzled medical supplies allocated by the Executive Yuan. This came to the attention of Chairman Liu, who inquired with Dai about the truth and instructed him to pay attention to the conduct of his staff. Dai became unhappy because he had long been at odds with Deputy Director Qiu Chongzhou and doctor Wang. He suspected that Qiu and Wang were secretly harming him. He became anxious and distraught. On the evening of the 6th, he obtained a pistol from Wang Chang, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, on false pretenses. Upon returning, he invited Qiu to discuss official business. As soon as Qiu entered the room, Dai pulled out the gun and fired, hitting Qiu in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. A worker, Zhang, heard the noise and went to investigate. Dai then fired five more shots in the courtyard, injuring Zhang in the abdomen. Dai returned to his room, while Qiu escaped through a window. When provincial and local authorities arrived on the scene, Dai was found lying on the ground, dead, with a wound on his neck, two inches long and over an inch deep. A shaving razor lay nearby, and blood covered the floor. The scene was extremely gruesome. According to Qiu, after seeing that Qiu was not dead, Dai attempted to kill him with a knife. Qiu was in a state of mental confusion at the time and did not know how Dai died. However, Qiu's palm had a knife wound running across it. After examination by the prosecutor, the nature of Dai's wound did not appear to be self-inflicted. Therefore, some suspect that Qiu disarmed Dai in self-defense and killed him. Qiu has gone to Beiping for medical treatment. The case has been transferred to the Chengde District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The truth of the matter is difficult to predict at this time.</p>

<h3>Addendum to the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan"</h3>
<p>— Luo Qinghua</p>
<p>How to Guide Black Market Hot Money to Actively Support Productive Enterprises</p>
<p>Due to the soaring prices and economic unrest triggered by the gold rush, the central authorities have convened numerous meetings, finally culminating on the 16th of this month with the Supreme National Defense Council formulating an economic emergency measures plan, which has been promulgated and implemented by order of the National Government. The plan's contents address various aspects, and it is indeed targeted at the current reality and economic ailments, sweeping away the long-standing practice of treating the symptom rather than the cause. It can be considered an emergency measure that conforms to the situation and public sentiment. However, being an emergency measure, it inevitably leans towards temporary solutions. Its essence can be encapsulated in the phrases "strengthen control and tighten credit." The problem of rising prices stems from two factors: (1) scarcity of goods and (2) excess of currency. The treatment method for the cause of the illness is to control and tighten, which is beyond reproach. However, if unexpected economic assistance is not forthcoming, then mere control cannot be sustained. Throughout the entire plan, the emphasis on how to actively support agricultural and industrial production to increase the supply of goods has not been strongly emphasized. Attempting to control goods and promote exports may not be as simple as one might imagine. Therefore, whether this can stabilize the currency value and balance the budget is worth studying. Furthermore, regarding the tightening of credit, the "Measures for Controlling Financial Operations" only control the operations of national banks and legitimate banks, while the most fundamental and massive black market hot money is not clearly addressed regarding how to suppress or guide it. Although all steps that should be taken to suppress prices, such as suppressing speculation, prohibiting gold trading, prohibiting foreign exchange circulation, controlling prices and wages, supplying daily necessities, controlling financial operations, and revising foreign exchange management, seem to have been formulated, with clear guidelines and comprehensive measures, all of these are merely concurrent economic ailments and not the root cause of the illness. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War in the mid-War of Resistance, a large amount of black market capital has been separated from legitimate financial institutions, and this has increased over time, becoming the "economic cancer" of our country for many years. Any economic market disturbance is due to the "activities of hot money." However, there has never been a proper method of blocking or guiding it, which cannot be achieved by "managing banks" or "controlling financial operations." This time, the emergency measures plan still does not have a method for giving this countless black market hot money a place to settle, and the issuing of tools for increasing hot money has not stopped. The vicious power of black market capital has become more rampant than during the War of Resistance. If the root cause of the illness is not removed, we cannot help but worry whether all the price control plans can achieve the expected effect of treating the symptoms. Moreover, although the same economic ailments exist, the pathological factors and time environment are significantly different from the War of Resistance period. If we still use the "Price Restriction Regulations" and "Extraordinary Period Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Regulations" from as far back as two or even eight years ago, whether these old prescriptions, which were not very effective at the time, can cure the illness today is also worth considering.</p>
<p>This humble author has always believed that economic problems can only be solved with economic measures, and political pressure can only be used occasionally as a supplement to remedy shortcomings. Especially since our country's organization is inferior to others, and there is no definite operational control over the personnel, training, integrity, and skills of the regulatory agencies themselves, it is difficult to expect them to fully implement their duties if they rashly carry out their duties. During the War of Resistance, how many people yearned for the control and distribution policies of Britain and the Soviet Union, believing that it would not be difficult for our country to catch up. However, the results of the trial implementation were mostly unsatisfactory. Even the provinces and cities with the strongest control suffered the most from the lessons of failure. After a long period of serious examination, the plan was changed in the 32nd year of the Republic, and the industry associations were allowed to set prices under the supervision of the government. As a result, the achievements were relatively satisfactory. The past is not far away, and the memories are still vivid. Considering that under the banner of "Resistance First, Nation Above All," with the National Mobilization Law available for use internally and the war zone blockade line as its scope externally, the expected effects of control could not be achieved. Now, the environment and time are vastly different from the past, the seaports are open in all directions, human desires are rampant, and political discipline and commercial ethics have both gone bankrupt. If high-level control is to be implemented, its consequences can be predicted without even trying. Moreover, the reason for rising prices during the war was mostly due to the prolonged blockade of the four borders, the increasing scarcity of goods, and the imbalance between supply and demand. As for the present, most daily necessities are not felt to be in short supply, and the purchasing power in various places is consistently low. The closure of factories and stores this year and the downward trend of red goods both fully demonstrate the current state of widespread recession. Theoretically, at least in the current situation, there should not be a serious price problem. Solely due to the announcement of export subsidies and import surcharges on February 6, preparations were not made beforehand as an exception, and the quantity and price of gold sold off afterwards were also mishandled, resulting in a sudden increase in gold and banknotes, stimulating prices and creating a huge uproar, setting a new record in the ten years of the War of Resistance. We believe that this crazy price surge was an unexpected event that should not have occurred. Under the influence of panic, industry and commerce may have temporarily engaged in bandwagoning, but most of them were just putting on a show and transactions were very few. The scarcity of remittances from the inland since the beginning of spring shows that actual sales are not rising. This time, the price surge will not be suppressed and will soon fall back. Even if prices rise again in the future, the main reason will be the increased issuance of "hot money." This is different from the situation during the war and should not be ignored. Any plan, whether temporary or fundamental, should take the transfer of black market hot money into production and construction as the only way to proceed. Minister Wang Yunwu once said, "There is a kind of contradiction in Shanghai's industrial sector. On the one hand, there is a shortage of funds, and requests are made to the government to handle industrial and commercial loans. On the other hand, there is an abundance of hot money, and they compete to speculate in gold trading." This is indeed the actual situation. But it is not that industrialists and businessmen both run real businesses, ask the government for loans on the right hand side, and engage in speculation on the left hand side with an abundance of hot money. The post-war economic market has been divided into two camps. One side is legitimate industry and commerce, which has endured hardships and remained self-reliant during the War of Resistance. Since the victory, it has still adhered to its posts, and under high interest rates, high wages, and virtual profits but actual taxes, it still suffers from a shortage of funds and has no access to loans. Most of the other side are newly emerging tycoons who buy gold, play with US dollars, manage loans, play high interest rates, package government bonds, and speculate and hoard, doing everything possible without engaging in productive enterprises. As with the former, there is very little surplus capacity to engage in speculation. Speculative capital has always caused trouble and disrupted the market, which is the robber of legitimate industry and commerce. It corresponds with bureaucratic capital, being close but distant, and colluding with each other. Reasonably speaking, legitimate industry and commerce and legally established banks should be protected by the government, while speculative capital and bureaucratic capital should be subject to national law. But the opposite is often the case. Black market capital does not need to deposit reserve funds, does not need to pay any taxes, and has no labor disputes. Although the government has formulated various laws, speculators do not need to have a significant store number or legal accounts. Evasion and trickery are often beyond the reach of the law. The total amount of deposit reserve funds of Shanghai's banks in January of this year was 340 billion yuan. It can be seen that the total amount of deposits in the city's banks is only over 200 billion yuan. At the same time, the amount of black market funds outside the banks is impossible to calculate. Based only on the estimated external debts of the factories and stores that went bankrupt last winter (as reported in the news, the debts of the bankrupt factories and stores, including national banks and bank loans, account for only one or two tenths, and the remaining eight or nine tenths are high-interest black market loans), black market funds should account for eight or nine times the local deposits in the loan category alone. If speculation in gold, banknotes, bonds, and hoarding are combined, then the black market hot money is ten times the total amount of deposits in Shanghai, which is over 2 trillion yuan, which is not excessive. The state controls the credit of banks in every possible way, but the black market hot money, which is ten times the amount of bank deposits, cannot be controlled. If it is allowed to flow freely, it will be difficult to implement economic policies across the board and bring the economic market back on track!</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, many control measures have often been swallowed whole, without distinguishing between friends and enemies, resulting in indiscriminate destruction. In many cases, speculative groups have not been harmed in the slightest, while legitimate industrial and financial enterprises have been severely persecuted, unintentionally or intentionally, turning into fraudulent cases and causing hot money to increasingly deviate towards the black market. For example, non-financial institutions receiving deposits is prohibited, but the current "Management of Banks" has detailed penalties for violations by banks, while there are still no measures to suppress black market deposits. This time, the "Management of Financial Operations" in the emergency measures plan has extremely strict regulations for commercial banks, provincial and municipal banks, and even national banks are not spared, but it is impossible to say that it is not a major omission that black market funds are not mentioned at all. The author believes that the activities of black market hot money are the biggest obstacle to all economic measures. Since this has been a well-known fact for many years, the government must address the reality, formulate separate laws, and severely suppress it, thereby guiding it into legitimate financial institutions and investing it in productive enterprises. This is the most urgent task at present. On the one hand, the government must provide active guidance to legitimate banks in addition to control, so that they can have the strength to cooperate with national economic policies and complete their tasks. As for national banks, since they each have professional responsibilities, assisting agricultural and industrial production and promoting export trade, the use of bank funds should not be restricted too strictly. The author recognizes that the "Management of Financial Operations" seems to emphasize suppressing the black market funds that are disrupting the market under government control, and should not, on the one hand, allow the black market to operate, and on the other hand, target legitimate banks as the object of strict control. As for the national banks, they should also adhere to national policies, stand on the same ground as the Central Bank, divide labor and cooperate, jointly control the black market, guide hot money, support productive enterprises, and achieve the entire economic measures plan.

<h3>New Stage Approaching in Indian Political Situation - Britain Promoting Joint Indian-Burmese Defense - Mountbatten Will Probe Indian Authorities' Opinions on Defense</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] After Britain's decision to withdraw from India by June 1948 at the latest, the situation in Burma has become increasingly important. According to well-informed sources, the British military in Burma intends to organize the future defense of India. After Burma becomes an independent country in the future, Britain intends to conclude a military agreement with it, stipulating that all officers and non-commissioned officers in the Burmese army will be appointed by Britons, in order to expand a group of capable personnel in the Burmese army, a part of which will be sent to support the defense of India in times of emergency, without weakening the Burmese army. The excessive expenditures incurred by this measure will be borne by Britain, and not supported by the Burmese treasury. According to this plan, India should have troops permanently stationed at vulnerable locations on the northwest and northeast borders. In the event of an invasion, these troops will be the first to defend and support for a considerable period of time, awaiting the arrival of British officers from Burma to take command of other Indian troops. The port of Karachi in the Sindh province of India should be fully leased to Britain. The major task of the new Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, is to reach an agreement with the Indian authorities on this issue. Marshal Mountbatten has selected General Ismay, the military advisor to Churchill's wartime cabinet, as a staff member. Ismay's mission is to probe the Indian authorities' opinions on defense issues. This plan was drafted by General Rawlinson, the former Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, in 1923 in order to prepare for any eventuality, and at that time it was only a hypothesis.</p>
<p>[Our News] London Broadcast, 22nd: According to reliable sources: Governor-General Wavell of India has resigned, and Churchill will attack the government's India policy. It is reported that Wavell had a meeting with Churchill before resigning. Churchill will fight with the government based on Wavell's factual report. Also, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, Elly, passed through London and delivered a letter from the Indian National Congress to Prime Minister Attlee, requesting the government to remove Wavell from office.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The new Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, has not yet completed preparations for taking office. He is expected to depart within the next week and has now established a temporary office within the India Office.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Governor-General Wavell of India met with Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, today, presumably to discuss the Indian policy announced by Prime Minister Attlee. Members of the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the Interim Government also held separate meetings today to discuss this declaration.</p>

Now that Vandenberg has spoken out, it is hoped that this will be voted on. However, many senators still want ample time for discussion, so a vote will not be taken immediately. The earliest date for a vote is next Monday. Vandenberg also said, "This year is a critical juncture. We must act swiftly and decisively and can no longer retreat into a fragile shell in the guise of pacifists, especially since other countries are expanding their military forces." Democratic Senator Maybank also read a new report from Moscow stating that the Soviet military budget exceeds President Truman's proposed Army and Navy expenditure of $11.2 billion by $4 billion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Truman issued an order today authorizing the US Atomic Energy Commission to urgently purchase war materials abroad and import them duty-free.

<h3>France Uncovers Political Conspiracy, Traitors Forge Documents to Frame Government Leaders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French police revealed today that they have uncovered an organization within the Fresnes prison near Paris, a concentration camp for French traitors, that was forging secret German police documents and leaking them to foreign governments to cause misunderstandings about French resistance and political leaders. The authorities are handling this case with extreme secrecy. The police officers ordered to carry out the search were only notified an hour beforehand. They immediately divided into 15 police cars and rushed to the camp in batches at midnight to search. As a result, 19 people were arrested, including 14 French citizens who had served as informants for the Germans and 5 former German intelligence officers. In addition, 5 people in Paris were arrested in connection with the case. It is rumored that some prison guards and lawyers of the French traitors were also involved. The warden, seeing a large number of people rushing in, thought that there was a prison break and urgently telegraphed the Paris police department. The latter sent police to the scene, and the two sides almost clashed. After explaining the truth, the first batch of 70 policemen surrounded the prison and took away 30 people according to the list of suspects. A number of forged documents were also seized. After interrogation, 19 people were formally arrested and will be charged with possessing foreign (German) documents and forging documents that endanger national security. According to the Ministry of Interior, the German spies in the Fresnes prison were still communicating with leaders who were fugitives. They also asked foreign countries to provide them with documents from German files to frame certain French political leaders, such as French Foreign Minister Bidault, who served as chairman of the National Resistance Movement Committee at the end of the German occupation of France, and former Prime Minister Gouin. Police also said that some of these forged documents have been leaked to the British and American embassies and consulates in Paris. Among the five people arrested in Paris, two were French women who served as couriers for the conspirators. According to police officers, the leader of the conspirators was familiar with French political life, and a German, a former leader of the German secret police, drafted the documents, which were typed by Germans outside the prison in the format of German official documents, then transported into the prison, where a Belgian engraver added forged official seals, and then transported out of the prison, attempting to place them in foreign embassy files, disguised as genuine German documents. The leaders of the case were Captain Cavalcanti, a former subordinate of Vichy intelligence leader Jean-Nan, and Klein, a former leader of the German secret police in Paris. The two were housed in separate rooms, one above the other, in the prison.</p>
<h3>Munich Beer Hall to Be Converted into a Nightclub</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Leipzig Radio reported that Hitler's old haunt, the Munich beer hall, will be converted into a nightclub for American soldiers.

<h3>The Complex Indian Question: Unity or Partition? The Entire Question May Be Handled by the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: The British and Indian spokesmen at Lake Success expressed doubts about the British handing over India to elected Indians. As for the Indian question being handed over to the United Nations, it is considered a possibility.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 21st] A senior official predicted today that when Britain relinquishes control of India on June 1948, the entire Indian question will be submitted to the United Nations conference for handling. Very few observers believe that the Muslim League and the Congress Party can abandon their differences and form a central government.</p>
<p>Muslim League figures say that no solution can satisfy the Muslim League unless Muslims and Hindus are completely separated. As for which parts of India will be included in the future independent Muslim state, it seems that it will be submitted to the United Nations conference for discussion. Currently, the governors of the Muslim League control the Sindh province in the west and the Bengal province in the east. The former's major city is Karachi, and the latter's major city is Calcutta, which is also the second largest city in the British Empire. The Punjab in the northwest is currently ruled by a coalition government, and Muslim League representatives insist that the Muslim League will occupy it before the British withdraw. In this complex situation, dozens of questions arise that cannot be resolved by the British and Indians, and will likely be submitted to the United Nations.</p>
<p>After the partition of Bengal province, the Assam province, which is predominantly Hindu, will be separated from the rest of India. Both Bengal and Assam provinces will likely appeal to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Northwest Frontier Province, ruled by a Congress Party governor, will also be cut off after the independence of Punjab province in the future. Furthermore, there are a large number of Sikhs and Hindus in the southern part of Punjab province, who may demand to secede from the Muslim partition regime. The western part of Bengal province is predominantly Hindu, as is its major city, Calcutta. These districts may request the United Nations to allow them to secede from the partition regime. However, the Muslim League insists that Calcutta and the western Bengal coal mining area are necessary for the partition regime. The state of Hyderabad is ruled by a Muslim prince, but its people are about 85 percent Hindu. On the other hand, the scenic Kashmir province, located on the shoulder of the Himalayas, is predominantly Muslim, but ruled by a Hindu prince.</p>
<p>After the British withdrawal from India in 1948, the various princely states may continue to maintain relations with the British government, but the Congress Party has long expressed its opposition to any plan that allows "small islands" within India to remain under British influence. New Delhi is neither pleased nor disappointed with the British government's statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 21st] The British statement yesterday did not significantly change the Congress Party's decision to establish an independent sovereign Indian republic. However, the Congress Party said that the famous Rajaji formula of 1944 may be the basis for further negotiations between the Congress Party and the Muslim League. According to the Rajaji formula, which was previously agreed to by Gandhi, a plebiscite of adult citizens would be held in the Muslim-majority areas of the northwest and east to decide whether to implement the India-Muslim partition plan. It is still uncertain whether the British statement will be beneficial to the continued work of the Constituent Assembly, which was not attended by the Muslim League.</p>
<p>Nehru's newspaper, "National Herald," did not welcome the British statement's reference to the possibility of transferring power to local governments, saying that "this move will be the beginning of unrest in India, not the end."</p>
<h3>Procedure for Discussions on the German Peace Treaty, France Proposes a Compromise Plan, Advocating the Establishment of Five Committees to Define Tasks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The Four-Power representatives at the German question conference today discussed the committee structure under the Foreign Ministers Conference. French representative M. Couve de Murville proposed a compromise suggestion to reconcile the views of the Soviet Union with those of the other three powers, but Soviet representative Gusev has expressed reservations about the compromise plan. The French plan would classify the committees into two categories: (1) Four standing committees on political, territorial, economic, and military matters; (2) An advisory and information committee. The former would be composed only of representatives of the four powers and could submit reports and suggestions to the Foreign Ministers Conference and the Foreign Ministers' representatives' conference. Each standing committee could establish subcommittees to study specific issues. Small countries directly related to the issue could also be invited to participate. British and American representatives expressed dissent to this last provision, believing that other small countries should also participate in the subcommittees, in addition to the directly related small countries. The Four-Power representatives discussed the French plan for a long time today, but without result. It was decided to submit the first part of the Soviet Union's procedural plan, that is, the provisions excluding the committee organization part, to the expert committee for review.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Ally with France to Jointly Cope with the Soviet Union and the United States</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: Britain is currently intensifying pressure to persuade France to conclude an Anglo-French agreement so that Britain can obtain a loyal ally at the Foreign Ministers Conference. At the same time, Britain intends to establish a Western European group, the purpose of which is to confront the Soviet Union in terms of offense, and to cope with the United States in terms of defense. The reasons are: (1) The United States has threatened the markets of Britain and France in Europe; (2) The United States is now extending its influence to the colonies of Western European countries.</p>
<h3>The American Garrison in Germany Will Be Completely Reorganized, General McNarney's Farewell Chaos</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st, United Press International] Lieutenant General Clay, who will succeed General McNarney as commander of the US occupation forces in Germany on March 15, announced today a comprehensive reorganization of the US occupation forces, which will gather most of the leaders in the army in Berlin. This reorganization will begin when Clay takes over McNarney's responsibilities. The head of the intelligence department will be transferred to Berlin, and the planning and implementation personnel of the supply and civil affairs departments will remain in Frankfurt. The reorganization of the army does not involve changes in personnel. Major General Keating will now succeed Clay as the US member of the Allied Coordinating Committee in Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 22nd] General McNarney, commander of the US occupation forces in Germany, is about to retire and will be succeeded by Lieutenant General Clay. McNarney created chaos on his departure, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the failure of the four occupying powers to fulfill their duties in implementing the Potsdam Agreement. McNarney advocated that the US military should relieve the military government of its responsibilities and that commissioners appointed by the State Department should take over the management. Germany need not be fully occupied thereafter, only key areas such as the Ruhr industrial area need to be occupied to solve the problem. This occupation should last from ten to fifteen years to see whether Germany has established a government sufficient to fulfill the peace treaty. In short, the US military's organization and training are not good at administration, and the occupying government is best led by commissioners.</p>

<h3>Truman Asks Congress to Allocate Funds to Relieve Liberated Countries, China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Poland Are Expected to Receive Assistance</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: In view of the imminent end of the UNRRA's work, President Truman has requested the US Congress to pass a relief fund of US$350 million for the needs of relief to liberated countries in 1947.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is approaching. President Truman today requested Congress to allocate $350 million for the 1947 budget for relief to liberated countries. Republican Congressman Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, immediately introduced a bill stipulating that countries receiving US aid should allow American journalists to report on its use. The committee is scheduled to discuss the matter next week. As for the actual allocation of funds, a separate bill is usually introduced later. This fund is in addition to the $300 million in the Army Department budget for relief to occupied countries such as Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea. In his message to Congress, the President did not list the names of the liberated countries that should be given aid. However, the State Department had previously announced that China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Poland all need to receive assistance in addition to UNRRA relief. When Congress passed the last donation of $456 million to UNRRA last summer, it stipulated "freedom of the press," which is similar to what Eaton proposed this time, and its main target was the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Supplement to "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" Continuation from page two "Weekly Forum"</h3>
<p>We request that all departments utilize their functions, mobilize a broader range of manpower, each adhering to their posts, and assuming responsibility at all levels, to jointly achieve success and complete the economic reform movement that the entire nation is urging. Combining the above arguments, it is believed that the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" is indeed an urgent solution for the present, but it must be implemented to its fullest potential to resolve the economic crisis. The following summaries are proposed for reference by all parties:</p>
<p>(1) In principle, it is confirmed that the current situation of rising prices and economic instability is caused by factors such as inflation and backward production.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of policy, the fundamental approach must focus on increasing production and reducing currency in circulation. However, as a temporary measure to address urgent needs, all restrictive, prohibitive, and regulatory measures stipulated in the plan must be implemented immediately and effectively.</p>
<p>(3) During the implementation process, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and financial institutions should faithfully adhere to national policies and assist government departments in jointly completing the mission. However, the government should also distinguish between good and bad, support the righteous and suppress the evil, and avoid superficial measures, lest they have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>(A) Temporary measures, focusing on reducing speculative capital:</p>
<p>(4) The government should formulate laws and reiterate the ban on operating banking businesses without approval. All underground banks, bill discounting companies, etc., should be strictly prohibited. Ordinary companies and firms should also be prohibited from accepting deposits. Violators will be subject to heavy fines and imprisonment. Depositors who deposit funds in illegitimate financial institutions will not be protected by law. Once discovered, they will be subject to fines or confiscation of deposits.</p>
<p>(5) Isolate usurious loans. Legitimate financial institutions (including state-owned banks) should provide low-interest loans to industries, farmers, and businesses based on their actual needs, eliminating the need to seek high-interest loans in the black market. This will narrow the avenues for black market funds, lower interest rates, and naturally encourage capital to flow back, be deposited in legitimate banks, and channeled into production.</p>
<p>(6) Legitimate banks should cooperate with national policies and operate in accordance with the law. The central bank and state-owned banks should provide economic assistance.</p>
<p>(7) To channel the large amount of speculative capital after the prohibition of gold trading, state-owned production enterprises should be reorganized as soon as possible, and stocks should be issued. A pilot project can be launched with the China Textile Industries Corporation (中紡公司). Select several factories, hire experts to evaluate and announce their prices, and entrust state-owned banks to issue stocks, guaranteeing principal and interest. Stocks can be publicly traded through the stock exchange. Once the stock issuance is fully subscribed, a shareholders' meeting should be convened immediately. The China Textile Industries Corporation authorities should immediately transfer operations to the board of directors and supervisors of the newly established fully private company. Other factories and state-owned enterprises can be handled quickly in a similar manner. Ultimately, this will absorb large amounts of speculative capital, freeze purchasing power, prevent speculation in physical goods, and increase government revenue to make up for the budget deficit.</p>
<p>(B) Fundamental measures, focusing on increasing production:</p>
<p>(8) Our country is an agricultural nation, and its exports have always been dominated by rural specialties. In recent years, due to frequent wars, the countryside has been devastated. Even in bumper years, food still needs to be imported. Cotton, tobacco, and other products that were once self-sufficient now rely heavily on imports, consuming a considerable amount of foreign exchange. The people's livelihood is declining, and the national economy is deteriorating. If this continues, what will become of us? Since the purchasing power of the countryside is extremely weak, the urban industrial and commercial economy will inevitably collapse. Therefore, restoring the countryside is a matter of utmost urgency. Since the War of Resistance, the countryside has been unstable, and rural men and women have flocked to the cities. If they are encouraged to return to their hometowns for employment, their houses are in ruins, and they need financial assistance for plows, farm tools, and seeds. However, this is the fundamental principle. Those who plan for the country should take a broad view and not hesitate. It is planned to start with the southeastern and southwestern non-military regions first. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Cooperative Treasury should jointly formulate an agricultural production increase plan, prepare a budget, and submit it to the National Supreme Committee for approval and implementation. Ultimately, rice, wheat, cotton, and other products should be self-sufficient this year, reducing foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
<p>(9) Rural export products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, cattle, sheep, hides, furs, medicinal materials, and minerals, should be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank of China, together with the former handling agencies, such as the Resources Committee, the Central Trust of China, the China Silk Corporation, etc., immediately propose a plan and budget, and provide as much lending as possible according to the actual seasonal needs, without delaying the farming season. It is hoped that the average output this year will increase by at least onefold compared to last year, expanding exports and increasing foreign exchange income.</p>
<p>(10) After the aforementioned production increase loan plan is approved by the government, the Central Bank should allocate funds and instruct specialized institutions such as the Farmers Bank of China and the China Silk Corporation to be responsible for handling it, without neglecting the effort for fear of minor setbacks, and without hesitation or procrastination.</p>
<p>(11) Although adjusting the exchange rate has largely resolved the difficulty of internal and external price differences in expanding exports, future changes are uncertain, and optimism is not warranted. However, export trade must not be delayed due to any difficulties. Therefore, the Central Trust of China and China Silk Corporation and other institutions can still handle purchases and supply for export. As long as the method is fair, not monopolistic, and does not hinder free trade, foreign countries will have no excuse. If there are still internal and external price difference issues for ten export items in the future, the import and export linkage system may still be adopted at its discretion. Ultimately, the goal is to promote exports through various different and effective methods.</p>
<p>(12) There should be an overall plan for industrial production increase. For certain kinds of daily necessities and export goods, an ordering system can be adopted, following the precedent of the guest engineer, Mr. Gibson, considering the factory's production costs. Low-interest production loans should continue to be offered to isolate black market funds and reduce production and marketing costs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office should investigate equipment and verify loans in advance, and the bank should audit it at any time to eliminate malpractices.</p>
<p>(13) Both agricultural and industrial loans may be agreed upon, as needed, to repay part or all of the principal and interest at the price of real goods, with both parties assessing a fair price according to the market.</p>
<p>(C) Price controls, based on industry price negotiations:</p>
<p>(14) Recognize the significant difference between current prices and wartime prices. In wartime, the main reason was the imbalance between supply and demand, and prices rose in a straight line. Therefore, preventing hoarding of goods was effective. Now, the main reason is excessive speculative capital and a decline in currency value. Preventing price manipulation is the focus, and reducing currency in circulation is the focus, while implementing price negotiations is a means. (According to last year's experience, a straight-line increase is no longer possible because interest rates are high and the supply of goods is unimpeded. Several price surges last year subsided naturally after a short period of time, and merchants no longer dare to hoard goods for profit). This is the difference between the past and the present.</p>
<p>(15) The government should announce price negotiation methods, using production, transportation, and sales costs plus legitimate profits as the price negotiation principle, and industry-wide control should be handled in accordance with the Industry Association Law.</p>
<p>(16) In accordance with the supply measures for daily necessities, the government should properly control material costs and control the market.</p>
<p>(17) To control finance, based on the deposit reserve box, the number of bank deposits is especially significant. Furthermore, in light of the recent crazy market turmoil, banks are as usual, and money is not very tight, able to control speculative capital. Therefore, in addition to formulating another bill (see item 1), banks should also automatically increase deposit interest rates to guide speculative capital. When deposits increase and costs decrease, banks should gradually reduce loan interest rates to cooperate with national policies. (Note) During this wave of instability, some newspaper headlines mistakenly referred to it as a financial panic. Even the written conversations of the civil and financial authorities were transmitted incorrectly and referred to it as "the shame of the banking industry," which is indeed shocking. Since the New Year, the banking industry has been stable as usual, and there have been few changes in depositors. During the crazy price increases, there was no rush to withdraw deposits, so money was not tight. However, it was heard that various banks were tight on funds because there were many depositors. It is not difficult to imagine who the large depositors of the banks are, so it is also clear who the major gold buyers were this time. Commercial banks themselves dare not buy gold and banknotes illegally, and most commercial deposits are small, so they are not enough to affect the gold rush. The truth is clear without investigation. In summary, this was clearly a gold and banknote rush that stimulated the price rush, which is almost known to everyone, but the deliberate distortion of facts, calling it "a financial panic," is difficult to understand.

<h3>Concentrating Tuberculosis Prevention Work, the Tuberculosis Department of the Sanatorium Closes, and the Tuberculosis Prevention Association Increases 50 Beds</h3>
<p>In order to concentrate on tuberculosis prevention work, the Health Bureau has previously decided to close the tuberculosis department of the Municipal Sanatorium on West Zhongzheng Road.

<h3>Printing Counterfeit Money. Counterfeit Money Organization Cracked Down in the Countryside of Huzhou. Technical Workers Recruited in Shanghai and Escorted to Secret Work. Evidence Searched Out from Haystack and Empty Coffin.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Qingsun, Director of the Changning Road Police Bureau Branch in West Shanghai, reported to Police Officer Wang Jianhua of the Judicial Section a month ago that there was a counterfeit currency organization with a large amount of counterfeit money produced, the largest in the city, totaling more than 140 million yuan. After receiving the report, Director Wang ordered Deputy Director Shao Yuanbin, Section Chief Shi Jieren, and others to start the investigation. He dispatched a large number of police officers on January 29 to investigate, but found no clues. On the morning of the 15th of this month, he received a third confidential report stating that they were selling and buying counterfeit money mostly around the Bazilu area. Section Chief Shi led the police to investigate secretly. Later, at the back door of No. 5 Hong'anli, they discovered a man and a woman who were related to the case. They were paying 2 million yuan to another person to buy 7 million yuan of counterfeit money. The police arrested both parties and took them to the bureau for questioning. According to the male confession: his name is He Baorong, the woman's name is Sheng Wumei, and the other person who sold the counterfeit money is Mo Zhongsheng, also known as Zhu Zhenzhi. The case handlers</p>
<p>interrogated strictly and he began to tell the address of Mo's residence, which was No. 5 Yihou Li, Jijiazhai Road, Hongkou. He then led them to the address, and as a result, more than 10 million yuan of counterfeit money was copied from a small box in a large suitcase. Two bundles of banknote paper were found behind the bed, a paper cutter was found in the closet, and several copper plates were hidden in the lower layer of the water tank. Each counterfeit seal of the president and vice president of the Central Bank was placed in an iron plate hole under the stove. The exhibits were taken to the bureau together, and after further interrogation, Mo had no choice but to</p>
<p>confess to the real supply. It is said that the principal offender, Lu Jin'ao, is the Zhongxiao guerrilla commander of Huzhou. He lives at No. 137 Pubei Lane, Tongqing South Road. His accomplice, Chen Youren, is a senator of Wuxing. He is hiding at No. 80 Yuanyuan Hotel, Jiujiang Road. There is also Zou Yunfang, who lives at No. 423 Jianguo East Road. The police bureau successively arrested the above three people. According to Lu Jin'ao's confession: this matter started as early as a year ago and was initiated by Mo Taizhong and Zhang Wuhao (Zhang held a military post and had great potential), who is on the run. At that time, Zhang invested 1.3 million yuan, and Mo was responsible for technical responsibility. Lu entrusted a Yang surnamed person to make a model with Mo, but neither was satisfactory. Later, Mo invited a Lai surnamed person from Taiwan and Chen Ada to join in the making of the plate, but there was little effect. Later, Wen Jinghao was hired to make the plate,</p>
<p>and it was successful. He is staying at No. 5 Nanyangli, Zhejiang North Road. On the same day, he was arrested. According to him, the plate maker and technical workers recruited each time were escorted by Zhang to Huzhou, Wuxi and other places on the night train for secret work. Shanghai only has offices, and the factory is located in Jianshan, 60 miles away from Huzhou, Huzhou. According to the confession, at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, Deputy Director Shao prepared a document and led member Wei Jinquan, police chief Li Wenbin, and policemen Gu Kunqi and Wang Dianxuan, escorted the two criminals Mo Zhongsheng and Chen Youren, and took a car to Suzhou, passed Nanxun and reached Huzhou. He submitted a document to the county police bureau, and they sent Inspector Li Jiaqing to accompany him. They took a three-plank boat through Chongzhao Town and Yueshi Town at night and arrived at Jianjiang Mountain. Because the ports and rivers in the area were vertical and horizontal, and bandits appeared from time to time, they searched everywhere, but could not find a way to start. At this moment, the factory staff Mo Achi, Li Weiji, etc. happened to pass by. Under the guidance of Chen Youren,</p>
<p>they were arrested and then confessed that there was a machine hidden in the haystack at No. 17, and there were parts (1) a printing press, including a complete set of accessories, (2) three sets of counterfeit copper printing plates, a total of nine pieces, (3) counterfeit copper seals of the president and vice president of the Central Bank, (4) a set of circular instruments, (5) a paper cutter, (6) six sheets of photographic paper, (7) four sketching pens, as well as dozens of pieces such as Shantou ink rolling tube small handsaw and small copper plate powder. When it was copied, 18.5 million yuan of banknotes with a denomination of 2,000 yuan were also copied. All of the above items were placed in the empty coffin on the mezzanine floor. The handling police officers brought the witnesses back to Shanghai and brought them to justice.</p>

<h3>Sacrificing Individual Enjoyment to Fight for Independence and Freedom: Four Sino-American Organizations Celebrate Washington's Birthday, Ambassador Stuart Delivers an Encouraging Speech to the Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The American University Alumni Association, the American Association of University Women, the Sino-American Cultural Association, and the Shanghai Returned Students Association jointly held a Washington's Birthday celebration at the Ritz Restaurant at 7 PM last night. More than 700 Sino-American dignitaries and socialites attended, including Mayor Wu and American Consul General Davis. The meeting was chaired by Wei Zengfu, President of the Returned Students Association. On the left side of the hall, two pillars were erected, each adorned with the flags of China and the United States, shining in mutual splendor. The guests socialized and enjoyed themselves, the gathering lasting until late at night.</p>
<p>During the event, Wei Zengfu first delivered a speech explaining the significance of holding the joint celebration, and then invited Mayor Wu to introduce Ambassador Stuart. Mr. Wu briefly stated: "During this difficult and challenging time for our country, we do not need agitators; we need sages. We do not need diplomats; we need kind and friendly ambassadors. I feel deeply honored today to introduce to you a gentleman who was born in China, grew up in China, and has lived and shared hardships with us. A sage and mentor, truly a wise teacher as Confucius hoped for, a sincere and kind ambassador unprecedented in the history of Chinese diplomacy." Following this, Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech, using Washington's spirit of fighting for freedom and independence to encourage the people of China to sacrifice individual interests for the greater good of the nation. His entire speech was profound, moving, and won a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart's Warning: China's Real Enemies Are Illiteracy, Poverty, Disease, and Selfish Abuse of Public Office</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart's speech, in brief, stated: "Although Washington's birthday is entirely an American holiday, it holds special significance for patriotic Chinese. In the commemorative spirit of the war we are in today, I would like to draw your attention to several aspects of Washington's career, which seem to have a special meaning for the current situation in China. In commenting on these situations, I ask you to apply your historical imagination to Chinese figures and problems.</p>
<p>We must not only think of Washington's contributions to the country throughout his life, but also of his own sacrifices. Because at that time, Washington could be considered the wealthiest and most comfortably situated person in all the American colonies. His residence had smooth lawns, and the house was filled with the most elegant furniture and decorations of that era, which could even be considered magnificent and luxurious by modern standards. He possessed all the comforts and enjoyments, yet he did not hesitate to sacrifice all of this for the dangers and uncertainties of the revolution.</p>
<p>Among his friends and contemporaries, there were many aristocratic figures as wealthy as Washington who dared not take such risks, preferring to maintain the colonial status. Many of them became 'collaborators' with the British army, much like those Chinese who collaborated with or worked for the Japanese a few years ago. From this, we can understand the temptations that Washington faced at the time, and his lofty ideals. The victory of China's War of Resistance against Japan is also due to the same noble characteristics of Chinese leaders, and Chinese patriots should feel proud of their similar fortunes, and I am equally proud of them.</p>
<p>What did Washington sacrifice everything for? He would probably say: for freedom or independence. What he had in mind was the self-government or democracy of the people, in which precious freedom is expressed. This concept of freedom is not found in books, but in the entire environment and tradition. When Lincoln mentioned the influence of the Declaration of Independence on him personally, he said: 'There is a sentiment here that will not only liberate the people of this country forever in the future, but also give hope to the world, giving everyone an equal opportunity.'</p>
<p>This idea has now been acquired by countless patriotic Chinese. The glorious ideals that created the first Kuomintang revolution and promoted the overthrow of the old Qing Dynasty have reappeared in the War of Resistance against Japan and various other national movements. China has now gained independence and has achieved a position of dignity and great potential power in the international community. The main problem in China today lies in achieving democratic government among the people, including the personal freedoms promised by the new constitution. However, in the struggle to bring these about, every Chinese patriot should take one thing as a prerequisite, and that is that he should be willing to sacrifice his own small self for the greater good, just as Washington did. China's real enemies today are internal difficulties, and overcoming these difficulties requires selfless dedication and courageous and optimistic determination. And this determination has been demonstrated in the past in resisting foreign aggression. China's real enemies are illiteracy, poverty, disease, and the selfish abuse of public office, including the personal interests of relatives and friends, as well as narrow and cruel partisan prejudices. China's hope lies in developing a new sense of national identity.</p>
<p>Seeing the special nature of the current national crisis, this lofty determination to put the nation first may be more influential in Shanghai than elsewhere, and I hope that those who have been educated in the United States will be the first to respond to this noble effort. In any case, I feel that the Americans here tonight will share my belief that our country sympathizes with the efforts of Chinese patriots in building a free, unified, peaceful, and democratic government."</p>

<h3>British Blind Baronet Benefits the Similarly Afflicted: The Status of Blind People in China Is Still in the Second Stage, Hired to Come to China to Guide the Work of Rehabilitation and Education for the Disabled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] British blind welfare expert Sir Mackenzie, accompanied by Dr. Flowers, hosted reporters at the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. During the meeting, Ms. Liu Dewei of the Relief Department of the Executive Yuan introduced the two, saying: Sir Mackenzie was blinded in both eyes during the First World War and is currently an advisor to the Indian government. Dr. Flowers has worked in China for 20 years. The two are extremely interested in China, especially the welfare of the blind, so this time they decided to come to China in response to the joint invitation of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to guide the work of rehabilitation and education for the disabled.</p>
<p>Following this, Sir Mackenzie delivered a speech stating: The evolutionary status of blind people in society can be divided into three stages: (1) In the initial stage, the entire lives of blind people are spent in suffering, darkness, poverty, and being despised, with no one to care for them, as people generally believe that after becoming blind, they cannot engage in any work; (2) At this time, a small number of groups work for the welfare of the blind, and although they achieve some success, they encounter many difficulties; (3) Subsequently, widespread social organizations and government agencies pay attention to the welfare of the blind, trying to provide relief, education, and find ways to earn a living. China is currently in the second stage.</p>
<p>Two Million Blind People in India</p>
<p>Sir Mackenzie strongly advocated that blind people must be cultivated and can become useful talents. He also reported on the current environment for blind people in India, where, due to the tropical climate, people are stimulated by the hot sun and ash, which over time causes blindness, so it is estimated that there are approximately two million blind people in India. In the past sixty years, the government and social organizations in India have gradually worked hard for the blind, such as running schools, establishing workplaces, training handicrafts, and providing employment opportunities in society. Sir Mackenzie himself has been serving blind people in India for four years. In addition, he also works specifically for blinded soldiers, providing them with equal education and technical training. Many blind people are now able to do various jobs, such as knitting wool, cloth, and towels, making rattan chairs, tables, and baskets, typing, writing, and working as music technicians. Among them, two soldiers who were both blind and had both arms amputated were able to type. This technology is provided with specially made typewriters, with artificial wrists attached to the soldiers' arms, allowing them to type quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>Departing for Beijing Today and Traveling to Various Places</p>
<p>At the same time, the St. Dunstan's Blind Institute in London, England, is famous throughout the UK. It was founded in 1915 by the famous British journalist Sir Arthur Pearson, who lost his sight in 1909 and strongly advocated that blind people should also be given opportunities for vocational training, so he founded the institute. Sir Mackenzie himself is also a graduate of St. Dunstan's Institute.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shànghǎi, Sir Mackenzie has visited several blind welfare organizations in the city and is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing today, after which he will go to Chongqing, Chengdu, Beiping, Guangzhou, and other places to conduct inspections. He will prepare a report on the results of the inspections to discuss improvements, with the period in China set for two months.</p>

<h3>Wú Suìrén's Case Concluded: Claims Loan Purpose Was to Help Small Businessmen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The District Court yesterday held another hearing to examine the case of Wú Suìrén, the former chief cashier of the Executive Yuan, who embezzled 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for interest-bearing fraud. After the debate was concluded, the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. The defendant Wú Suìrén claimed yesterday that the purpose of privately lending public funds was to seek profit and to help small businessmen, so the interest rate was very low. He also said that he voluntarily surrendered after the case was discovered and asked the court to be lenient in sentencing. However, the prosecutor refuted that the surrender should be made to the court, not to the superior officer. In this case, the defendant only notified the superior officer after the case was discovered and cannot be regarded as a surrender. According to witness Zhōu Jīnfú, the loan was indeed made, and the original plan was to lend for half a month, but the money was recovered in eight or nine days. The defendant's lawyer had applied for bail, but Judge Shào Rénjié rejected it, and the defendant was still remanded in custody.</p>

At around 11:00 AM, Yáng exchanged the U.S. dollars for 12,338,400 yuan in legal tender and returned to the shop first. Unexpectedly, at the entrance of Téngfèng Alley, a robber suddenly appeared with a gun, demanding that he hand over all the cash. At that time, Yáng struggled, angering the robber, who fired a shot, hitting Yáng in the chest. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robber took the opportunity to steal the cash and fled without a trace. Later, passersby discovered the incident and quickly summoned an ambulance to take him to the Gōngjì Hospital for treatment, but because the injury was to a vital organ, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>

Since the start of the tournament, Tung Wah has been unstoppable. Even a formidable team like Qingbai has been defeated by them repeatedly. They have achieved six victories and are highly confident in facing their opponents for the championship. There are four matches remaining, two against Youyou and two against the Soviet Union. Today's match is particularly important in the schedule. The lineup was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang. The defense remains the same, appearing very solid. In particular, after returning from Hong Kong, Bang Lun will be making his first appearance, and after being apart for three days, everyone expects him to deliver an excellent performance. Ah Dai has retired from the forward line, and Han Longhai will lead the troops, with "nephew" Chen Langzhe filling the right wing position, partnering with "uncle" Jia Youliang on the field, and with Sun Jinshun on the left wing, the offensive momentum is sure to be strong. If they perform normally, they should maintain their winning record.</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Union's performance in this league has been inconsistent, their fighting spirit remains strong. The selection of Robert Stoff and Carlo Reich to the inter-port team proves the strength and talent of their squad. The lineup for today's match was announced yesterday by Carlo Reich, showing a strong defense and offense, not to be underestimated. Furthermore, the team has been training diligently, with ample stamina. Tung Wah should exercise caution when facing them. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Meng Xian Cup Mini-Football Tournament Kicks Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seventeen Matches Today</p>
<p>The first Meng Xian Cup Mini-Football Tournament, organized by Meng Xian Middle School, opened at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Nanshi Municipal Stadium. Director Gu of the Education Bureau was unable to attend due to official business and was represented by Deputy Director Li Ximou, who performed the opening kick. Approximately one thousand spectators attended, creating a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results of the matches were as follows: In the first match, Group A, between Hwa Kwong and Jian Hwa, with Fang Rongfu as the referee, Jian Hwa took the lead 2-0 in the first half due to their balanced talent. In the second half, Hwa Kwong attempted a counter-attack, but Jian Hwa's strength prevailed, and they scored again ten minutes before the end of the game, winning 3-0.

<h3>Central Daily News Star Team</h3>
<p>The Central Daily News mini-football team played against the Newspaper Star team the day before yesterday. The latter team is a joint organization of various newspapers. The Central Daily News team won by a score of 3-0. It is said that the Central team will play the Municipal Printing team again today.</p>
<h3>Musings by the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>Last night, Hwa Lien played with their full strength, with Da Li, A Di, Lao Bao, Xue Chong, and Xiang Cheng. This was likely Hwa Lien's strongest lineup. Although they won against Encas by four points, the performance was not ideal. The defense under the basket was not tight enough, and there were many wasted opportunities in the first half. Only Da Li and Lao Bao played up to their usual standards. Xue Chong was not at his best. The team seemed to lack practice, but his steady passing still made an impact.</p>
<p>The final match between Chen You and Zong Lin in Group B was thrilling. Chen You wore red, while Zong Lin wore green. Both teams adopted a man-to-man defense, with clear and fast movements, making for a spectacular display. The first half ended 9-9, evenly matched. In the second half, Chen You took the lead 15-10, the largest lead of the entire match. Zong Lin then overtook them 18-17. After that, the score fluctuated, remaining within three or four points. Chen You finally won the championship 25-22. Chen You's victory was due to their quick shots, drives to the basket, and more accurate shooting. In terms of teamwork, Zong Lin was actually</p>
<p>In another match in Group B, the Indian team showed rapid improvement, and it was very difficult for Pei Er to win. (Chang Nian)</p>

<p>The Women's Group will take the stage first. The Green Team and Snow White are undefeated teams. They will meet on a narrow road.

<p>In the Group A Second Division, Team V will play against Hua Yang. The latter is a transformed Fatty Team and is quite strong. Team V will likely surrender.

Ren Yu has emerging talents such as Yao Wenyu, Shen Pengju, and Wang Huaiting. Their lineup is "strong." The Railway Team has lost every match, so there is no hope of victory.

<h3>How to Transfer State-Owned Industries to Private Ownership - Initial Exchange of Opinions Yesterday - Massive Assets, Market Capital Difficult to Bear - Value to be Estimated First, Measures to be Drafted for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Regarding the method of transferring state-owned production enterprises to private ownership, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, convened the heads of relevant agencies yesterday for an initial exchange of opinions. The meeting began at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Bank of China Building on Renji Road on the Bund in this city and adjourned at 5:30 PM. The attendees included Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Qian Changzhao, Shu Yunjun, Liu Gongyun, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyu, Tai Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Yang Xiren, and Xu Guangchi.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Vice President Weng told reporters that the meeting was convened according to Article 1, Section D of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan: All state-run production enterprises, except those in the heavy industry sector and those that must be operated by the government due to significant special circumstances, should be sold or sold to private ownership through the issuance of shares in order of urgency. Premier Song instructed the convening of the heads of relevant agencies to discuss the implementation measures. After today's meeting, it was generally believed that the assets of various state-owned production enterprises were too large, and the market capital might not be able to absorb them all at once. Therefore, it was proposed to focus on practical work steps. The relevant authorities in charge of each enterprise, such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Commission, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office, should first estimate the value of the assets of their respective production enterprises, list detailed schedules, and prepare a written opinion on how to transfer them to private ownership. These should be submitted to the meeting for discussion, and then implementation measures should be decided. The next meeting is expected to be convened in about a week.</p>
<h3>Major Players Rush to Unload - Chinese Stocks Lose Color</h3>
<p>The vigor of Chinese stocks decreased slightly yesterday. While influential figures and bank cartels pushed upwards, major players in the industry unanimously sold, leading to a tug-of-war. Ultimately, with the environment becoming increasingly unfavorable, fatigue was evident at the end.</p>
<p>The morning opened low, continuing the downward momentum from the previous day. Qinxing caused widespread selling because the opening price was unreliable, dropping from a high price to the daily limit. Deyong Yarn was aggressively sold, from 133, 152, 145, 97, 8, 137, 185, 28, and 223, falling to 2355 yuan. Numbers 171, 224, 76, 173, 178, 145, and 23, as well as retail investors, bought in. The bank cartels had healthy appetites. Deyong Yarn rose to 2500 yuan. Numbers 145, 198, 152, 125, and 223 sold out, falling back to 2390 yuan. There was a major tug-of-war after this, with the market only rising after 11:00 AM. Numbers 219, 232, 94, 22, 31, 85, 49, and 91 all entered, rising back to 2570 yuan. Numbers 152 and 198 continued to sell out, and numbers 223, 145, 28, and 105 also sold, falling back to 2360 yuan. Numbers 68, 76, and 218 still bought in, and Deyong Yarn rose to 2520 yuan. Numbers 152, 145, 223, 219, 224, 154, 76, 91, and 12 aggressively sold out, and the afternoon saw the decline intensify, falling to a low price at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Deyong Yarn, Xinyi, American, New Light, Jingfu, and Dongxing all fell by 10% to slightly more than 10%, Huafeng fell by 5%, and sluggish stocks such as Commercial Press and Sino-French rose slightly. Underwear brand Jinglun was flat. There were no transactions for Zhongsi, Wuhe, and Jiufu. The rest fell by 5% to 15%. Off-market stocks remained relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Fluctuates - Few Transactions</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to fluctuate yesterday. Bonds A, B, C, and D initially fell before rising, and then weakened at the close. Type E initially rose before falling, with few transactions, totaling no more than 4 million yuan. Tongbing opened in the morning at 7500 yuan, fell to a low of 7300 yuan after opening, rose to 8300 yuan in the middle, and finally hovered around 7600 yuan. Major players, such as yarn and flower syndicates, bought in, while the Chaozhou syndicate sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, Bonds A and B fell by 600 yuan, Bond C fell by 1,000 yuan, Bond D fell by 500 yuan, and Bond E fell by 1,100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bull Positions Liquidated - Foreign Stocks Weakly Fall</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also initially rose before falling yesterday. Securities firms liquidated their long positions, and foreign merchants also closed positions. Yi Yarn fell from an initial price of 18,800 yuan in the morning to a low price at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson was flat, Yeguang fell by 10%, and the rest fell by about 5%.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Savings Bonds and Government Bonds - All Converted at the New Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the Economic Emergency Measures Plan and prohibited the circulation of foreign currencies, there has been much doubt about how to handle US dollar government bonds and US dollar savings bonds. Recently, a reporter learned from the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance that since the government promulgated the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations in February 1946, all US dollar bonds issued by the government are regarded as foreign exchange in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. Therefore, matured US dollar government bonds, US dollar savings bonds, interest coupons, and winning tickets can be exchanged for legal tender at designated banks according to the newly established exchange rate.</p>
<h3>This Year's Salt Loan Total - Increased to 140 Billion</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with government policies, regulate food for the people, and increase production, the Four Joint Offices specially organized salt loans last year, dividing them into the Shanghai and Chongqing regions to handle transportation, sales, and production matters. This year, salt transportation costs have increased significantly, and salt taxes have also been adjusted. The situation has changed greatly. The total amount of salt loans for this year should be increased. The Salt Administration has formulated the national salt loan amount based on the actual situation. It is understood that the total amount of production and sales loans in the Sichuan salt region has been revised to 80 billion yuan, and the total amount of production and sales loans in the Huai salt region is 62 billion yuan, for a total of 142 billion yuan. The Sichuan salt region includes the production and sales areas of Sichuan salt: (1) the Sichuan-Kang area, (2) the Hunan-Hubei area, and (3) the Guizhou area. The Huai salt region includes (1) the Lianghuai area, (2) the Shandong area, (3) the Hunan-Hubei area, and (4) the Anhui-Jiangxi area. It is also understood that loans for transportation equipment and warehouse construction are all included in the above loans. The Shanghai and Chongqing Silver Gardens will soon convene a committee meeting to discuss the allocation of production and sales amounts and report to the Four Joint Offices for final approval.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Buying and Selling Jewelry - Money Situation, Management, and Storage - Director of the Coinage Department Says It May Be Difficult to Grant</h3>
<p>(Our Report) A reporter interviewed Dai Mingli, Director of the Coinage Department, yesterday to inquire about the issue of jewelry sales. According to him, regarding the request of the silver industry to be allowed to buy and sell gold jewelry, Article 1 of the Measures for Suppressing the Buying and Selling of Gold prohibits the buying and selling of gold bars and gold jewelry, with violators being confiscated and forfeited to the government. Therefore, the request may be difficult to grant. Furthermore, regarding the request of the money exchange industry to be allowed to operate small-amount deposit business, the originally defined business scope of the money exchange industry did not include this item, so it also seems difficult to grant the request.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Waste Cotton for Textile Machine Parts - Relevant Parties Are Negotiating with Japan</h3>
<p>(Our Report) According to estimates by people in the textile industry, China imported 20,000 spindles from foreign countries last year. It is estimated that 100,000 spindles can be imported this year, and it is hoped that 200,000 spindles can be imported next year. In terms of domestic manufacturing capacity, China currently produces 20,000 spindles per year, while Japan can produce 500,000 spindles, a huge disparity. It is understood that relevant parties are considering exchanging waste cotton for parts and accessories for cotton spinning machines from Japan. Before the war, Japan had 12 million spindles, and its supporting equipment, such as parts and accessories, matched this scale. Today, Japan's textile industry has shrunk to 3.5 million spindles, so there must be many remaining parts and accessories. China currently has about 1 million spindles received, but they cannot start operating due to a lack of parts. Therefore, if this barter trade can succeed, it will greatly contribute to the development of China's cotton textile industry. It is said that relevant parties have begun negotiations. The key to success or failure lies in the attitude of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Using Group Arbitrage to Attract Deposits - Securities Exchange Has Taken Measures to Suppress - Four Articles Stipulating Measures for Managing Arbitrage Transactions</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The Shanghai Stock Exchange has made a statement regarding opening up arbitrage transactions. The original text states that the purpose of opening up arbitrage transactions is to guide floating capital into the right track. Brokers should adhere to the principle of buying and selling on behalf of customers and not use it as a method of managing funds. Recently, some individual brokers in the Exchange have published group arbitrage advertisements, revealing methods for guaranteeing interest and dividends, which are close to attracting deposits and are clearly in violation of Article 21 of the Exchange's Provisional Business Rules. Furthermore, arbitrage transactions must be completed on the floor. Transactions made through internal transfers may lead to abuses. In order to prevent problems and enhance the reputation of brokers, the Exchange has stipulated four articles of measures for managing arbitrage transactions, which will be implemented from today. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Individual brokers of the Exchange who accept customers' entrustment for arbitrage transactions shall complete the transaction on the floor and shall not complete the transaction through internal transfers. After the transaction is completed, they shall hold the transaction note or list to the Auditing Section of the Business Department of the Exchange for stamping and certification.</p>
<p>(2) The accounts of individual brokers of the Exchange for items related to arbitrage on behalf of customers shall be displayed separately and marked with the words "arbitrage on behalf of customers" and shall not be mixed with other items.</p>
<p>(3) Individual brokers of the Exchange shall publish the account statements for each period to all clients when conducting group arbitrage on behalf of various groups.</p>
<p>(4) Individual brokers of the Exchange who conduct arbitrage on behalf of customers shall not guarantee interest or dividends on the principal delivered by the clients, except for the interest actually earned from arbitrage. The methods for proving the transaction note are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Brokers shall not refuse to obtain a transaction note certified by the Exchange at the request of the customer. If the broker refuses to provide proof, the customer may directly request proof from the Exchange. If a transaction note is not certified by the Exchange, the customer may not claim priority to the surety money paid by the broker to the Exchange in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>(2) Brokers have the obligation to reply to the Exchange for the corresponding floor account number of each transaction note and how the price was agreed upon.</p>
<p>(3) For transaction notes that do have corresponding floor accounts, the Exchange will affix the certification seal and the private seal of the person in charge (the impression style can be obtained from the Exchange).</p>
<p>(4) Transaction note certification matters will be handled by the Auditing Section of the Exchange (Room 120, Securities Building).</p>
<p>(5) Certification time starts at 9:00 AM on the day following the transaction day (including the after-market of the previous day).</p>
<h3>The Number of Firms that Suspended Operations Last Year - Chengda Bank and Jianguo Bank - The Ministry of Finance Revokes Licenses - Liquidation of Deposits Supervised by the Municipal Government and the Central Bank</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The Ministry of Finance announced yesterday the revocation of the original approval for the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank and issued a statement as follows: The Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank both stopped exchanging after December 20 of last year due to a shortage of funds. The Ministry of Finance sent personnel to inspect and learned that the business of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank was not normal even in normal times. Loans were extremely excessive, and managerial personnel misappropriated bank funds, evaded the payment of deposit reserves, and engaged in illegal activities such as buying and selling gold and foreign exchange. They also set up secret accounts to conceal the true state of assets and liabilities and engaged in illegal operations in an attempt to evade control. Furthermore, Jianguo Bank did not follow the regular business procedures for lending and there were many irregularities and secret accounts for recording income. When the money supply tightened and depositors made withdrawals, the two banks declared suspension of operations. In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance ordered them to repay deposits within a specified period of time. They were also ordered to report all creditors and debtors to be reviewed and approved. However, the liquidation of the two banks' creditors and debtors has been in progress for more than a month, and there is still little progress. In order to show punishment and serve as a warning, the Ministry of Finance has revoked the original approval for the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank. The liquidation of deposits has been entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Central Bank for supervision to protect the interests of depositors.</p>
<p>A reporter interviewed Dai Mingli, Director of the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance, yesterday, who said that the Ministry of Finance sent letters to the two banks on January 29 of this year regarding the suspension of exchange by the two bank branches, instructing them to sort out all deposits and issued bank drafts within half a month from the date of the letter and to sort out all debts within one month. Later, on February 8, it received a reply from the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank stating that it was raising funds to sort things out. On the same day, it also received a reply from the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank stating that it would comply with the order. However, it has not yet seen the liquidation completed.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank was suspended from exchanging at the clearing house on December 23 of last year. The headquarters of the bank was established in Chongqing in 1940. The capital was 20 million yuan, and it recently planned to increase its capital to 500 million yuan. The chairman is Li Zushen. The general manager and manager of the Shanghai branch is Zhang Yuliang, and the deputy manager is Zhang Jinghan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank was suspended from exchanging at the clearing house on December 26 of last year. The bank was founded in Chongqing in May 1941 by Sun Linfang and others. The capital was 10 million yuan. On March 26, 1946, the Shanghai branch was established. On June 1, the headquarters also moved to Shanghai. On June 10, the Shanghai branch officially opened. In addition to the branch at 200 Nanjing Road, there are also two branches at 795 Nanjing West Road and 963 Linsen Middle Road in this city. The current chairman and general manager is Sun Linfang, and the manager of the Shanghai branch is Fan Yuqin.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend continued to tighten yesterday. Green sugar rose by another 5,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and others also slightly improved. The Haohuo Oil Syndicate opened with 300 packages of extra green sugar at 133,000 yuan, and Shunde green sugar at 130,000 yuan.

<h3>Fine Cloth Sales Slightly Improve - Market Price Changes from Solid to Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened steadily. Sales of 12-pound top-quality fine cloth improved slightly, once quoted at 147,000 yuan. Later, buyers sold off due to rumors, and the price immediately dropped by 2,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold Five Blessings fine cloth, with the price opening at 143,000 yuan, similar to the market price, which made people's hearts firm. Sales of colored cloth on the market were not strong, and dyeing factories were also reluctant to buy white cloth, resulting in a trend of firmness with a soft undertone in the market.</p>
<h3>Rice Transactions Are Not Strong - Oil Beans Improve in Appetite</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 13,500 stones of rice arrived in the North and South rice markets, but market transactions were active but not strong. High-quality japonica rice was settled, and medium and low-quality rice continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Baiyuan rice followed the decline of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and Yinyuan rice showed a flat and weak trend.</p>

<p>Hong Kong's sales of red beans are soaring step by step, continuing to rise sharply by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans remain temporarily flat, corn follows the rise of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, the sales of raw kernels in foreign factories are leisurely, and the price is neither good nor bad, but the medium and low-quality oil factories are buying very happily, rising by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Sesame is scarce and firm, and the situation is secretly tight. Broad beans turned weak, and black sesame soared by 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Flour Rationing Resumes</h3>
<p>The five major flour mills in this city, Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, had temporarily suspended the sale of flour due to the exhaustion of raw materials and inability to produce. It is now learned that with the assistance of the authorities, the raw material supply issue has been resolved, and flour rationing will resume immediately. Each bag will still cost 30,000 yuan. According to another source, the government previously ordered a large amount of wheat and foreign flour from the United States. Currently, 50,000 bags of flour, loaded on the "Hede" of the Fulai Company, have arrived in China and are already at the Songkou port, expected to arrive in port tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed no signs of improvement, with actual sales still sluggish and morale lacking. However, in the early morning, ordinary 20-count yarn, such as the Liuma brand, after falling close to 3 million, was once again favored by the industry. After a scramble to clear out inventory, prices rebounded to around 3.1 million, resulting in a slight drop of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Waterproof Cloth Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Sales of waterproof cloth have continued to be active in the market recently, with considerable actual sales in various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. Prices have also been rising. First-grade goods are being quoted at 16,000 yuan per yard, and second-grade goods at 13,000 yuan. The standard for these prices is based on fluctuations in yarn prices and the factory's cost accounting.</p>
<h3>Export Green Tea Favored by Buyers</h3>
<p>Due to unsuccessful negotiations on the TUNA agreement, the market for foreign-operated Qimen black tea remains quiet. However, green teas such as Chunzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei needles, which are popular in Africa, are selling increasingly actively, and prices are relatively stable. There are currently over 700 boxes of aged Chunzhen Zhenmei, and Yutai Tea Company and Wuchang Tea Company are in negotiations with the suppliers. It is reported that the price difference is not significant, and an agreement is likely to be reached in early next week. As for domestic-only varieties such as Dafang, Longjing, and Shuangjing, sellers are stubbornly holding out, making it difficult for buyers to purchase, resulting in a stagnant market.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Increases Late Declaration Fee</h3>
<p>Regarding customs declarations by merchants in this city, the submission of declarations is often delayed due to time constraints. According to customs regulations, merchants who submit export declarations after the prescribed daily time are charged a late fee of 400 national currency per declaration. Currently, due to rising prices, merchants are not concerned about paying the 400 yuan fee. Therefore, the customs authorities have obtained approval from the Inspector General of Customs to increase the late declaration fee to 2,000 yuan per declaration. The new fee has already been implemented by the customs office.</p>
<h3>Japan to Exchange Transportation Equipment for Two Types of Chinese Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to sources, the barter trade between China and Japan is being actively promoted. In addition to pit props, which are urgently needed for the rehabilitation of major coal mines in the north, surplus transportation equipment from Japan is also urgently needed by China. After repeated negotiations between relevant Chinese authorities and General MacArthur's headquarters, concrete results have been achieved. It is reported that the headquarters has agreed to ship 300 locomotives and 2,000 freight cars to China within the next two years, in exchange for China supplying Japan with two types of raw materials. The principle has been decided, but the price issue is still under negotiation. As for what Japan hopes China will supply, the first priority is one million tons of salt. There has been much criticism from the outside regarding China supplying salt to Japan, believing that it will boost Japan's chemical industry. However, those familiar with the inside story believe that salt has a global market, and if China does not ship salt to Japan, Britain will ship African salt to supply them, which will not help and will only result in the loss of the market. Japan is also experiencing a shortage of vegetable oil, and the need will be even greater in the second half of the year. They also hope that China will supply them. In addition, it is reported that 20,000 tons of soybeans will also be shipped to Japan this year. Taiwan sugar is urgently needed by China itself, and although the other party has repeatedly requested it, we have not agreed to supply it. However, due to the high prices in the Japanese black market, some smuggling is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Abundant Pork Arrivals Lead to Price Weakness</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Previously, due to continuous rainy days, the arrival of pigs was very limited, and the dismantling price of pork rose to 380,000 yuan per 100 market catties. With the recent clear weather, the supply from all sources has been abundant, and the current dismantling price has fallen to 310,000 yuan. The retail prices of lean meat and spareribs have not changed much compared to before.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Show Mixed Price Trends</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Trading in industrial raw materials has gradually begun, but the types and quantities traded are not yet very large. Caustic soda (Moon Brand) was traded at 5.5 million yuan per barrel, and liquid caustic soda (40 Baume) at 4.4 million yuan per ton. Soda ash continued its downward trend, with McCallie goods (80 kg per bag) priced at 220,000 yuan. Sodium sulfide was 4,000 yuan per pound, and zinc oxide powder increased by 2 million yuan per ton, with the current price at 10 million yuan. Triacetin is extremely scarce in the market, and only Indian glycerin has been traded, priced at around 1.5 million yuan per can (5-6 lbs).</p>
<h3>Leather Prices Rise, Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the increase in foreign exchange rates, the import costs of grained leather have increased, and prices have risen sharply. Tree Brand grained leather has increased from 32,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan per square foot. Shunfeng grained leather has increased from 27,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan, and Jingangzan grained leather has increased from 26,000 yuan to 43,000 yuan. Arrivals of raw hides have become scarcer, and exports have begun, with prices also rising steadily. Raw cowhide has increased from 280,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan per 100 market catties, and large-sized yellow cowhide has increased from 550,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan. Actual sales of various goods are not very strong. It is reported that water buffalo hide in Hankou is 360,000 yuan per Sima dan, and yellow cowhide is 110,000 yuan per Sima dan.</p>
<h3>Nationwide Survey of Yarn Mill Equipment Shows 224 Factories, Including State, Provincial, and Private</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Machinery Association, there are currently 224 yarn mills nationwide. These include 41 state-owned, 2 provincial-owned, and 181 privately-owned mills. The state-owned mills have 2.9 million spindles and over 38,000 looms; the provincial-owned mills have only 200,000 spindles; and the privately-owned mills have 2.68 million spindles and over 30,000 looms. Comparing state-owned and privately-owned mills, privately-owned mills have slightly more spindles, while state-owned mills have about half more spindles than privately-owned mills. The details are presented below for reference.</p>

<h3>Coal Capital Fushun</h3>
<p>— Shenyang, 16th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>The Changbai Mountains run diagonally from east to southwest, and the remaining veins form undulating hills. After passing Fushun, they merge into the Liaodong Plain to the west. Fushun is located on the edge of this Liaodong Plain, backed by mountains and facing rivers, with a magnificent terrain.</p>
<p>The urban area is 20 kilometers long from east to west, bordering the south bank of the Hun River, and 6-7 kilometers long from north to south, with the river as the boundary. The Hun River meanders through the territory from the east, joining with the Wendao, Majun Dan, Liulin, Guchengzi, and other small rivers, and merging with the Taizi River before flowing into the Liao River and the Bohai Sea.</p>
<p>Fushun is bordered by Benxi to the south, Tieling and Faku to the north, Qingyuan and Xinbin to the east, and Shenyang to the west, with a distance of 80 li. The city covers an area of 91,123,050 square meters, surrounded by low mountains. The climate reaches -25 degrees Celsius in the coldest periods and around 37 degrees Celsius in the hottest periods. The freezing season lasts from early December to early March. According to statistics, rainfall has been gradually increasing, with an average annual rainfall of 1,000 mm.</p>
<p>Historical Treasure Land</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, the blood, sweat, and labor of the Chinese people have built this modern city. The new facilities include wide asphalt roads, and most of the government offices are high-rise buildings. Electricity, telephones, and trams are all available. In the summer, there are fully equipped swimming pools, and in the winter, there are spacious and magnificent skating rinks. The city's sports field is grand in scale, with stands capable of accommodating 20,000 people. The indoor sports field is also very well-equipped. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall can be considered the most sophisticated building in the Northeast, with a rotating stage. Fushun can be considered a very good city.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, this place was extremely simple. It was just a desolate village on the south bank of the Hun River, sparsely populated with dozens of households, a purely agricultural society. Now, stepping out of the urban area into the rural countryside, one can still see prosperous mulberry fields and vegetable gardens, with considerable production that can be self-sufficient. In particular, the rice is of a Japanese improved variety, with round, large grains and a pure white color, especially of high quality. For the past ten years, this grain has been exclusively for Japanese consumption and not allowed for us Chinese to eat. Now, of course, you can enjoy it anytime, anywhere in Fushun.</p>
<p>Fushun, formerly known as "Qianjin Pass," is world-famous for its largest coal mine in the Far East. Later, due to this coal mine mother, it continued to nurture many sub-industries, creating a purely Japanese city. It can be said to be a great masterpiece of meticulous management and exploitation by the Japanese. After the enemy surrendered, Mr. Zhang Xinfu came here to take over and was killed, again attracting national and worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Standing on the edge of the "Open-Pit Mine" west of Guchengzi and looking out, it is three li wide and four li long, with an original coal seam of 125 meters. It is still billowing with "self-igniting" white smoke. Dozens of light coal transport railway tracks and spiderweb-like electric wires create a truly magnificent scene.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, this Fushun city was called "Suoyang City." When Qing Taizu rose up in Xingjing and extended his forces downstream along the Hun River, Suoyang City was the first to bear the brunt and was conquered. It was renamed "Fushun City," and the people of Fushun were thus "pacified and subdued."</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, we have not had the opportunity to personally control this Qianjin Pass. On the contrary, we remember that the Russians and Japanese fought here on our national territory. Two years ago, this fertile land was once again regarded as spoils of war and robbed. After the devastation, the population of Fushun has decreased by one-third, and the industry has only recovered to one-tenth or two-tenths of its pre-war level.</p>
<p>Coal Industry</p>
<p>People have been using coal for roughly 2,000 years, but large-scale mining began about 1,000 years ago, during the Goguryeo and Liao-Jin dynasties, for use as fuel in the manufacture of pottery. After that, dynasties rose and fell, and there were constant disturbances. It is feared that only the locals mined some for fuel.</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Guangxu Emperor, Wang Chengyao, Yan Zhiyue, and others were approved by the Fengtian General to conduct small-scale mining. Later, due to weak financial resources, Russian capital was introduced. Three or four years later, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, and this treasure was seized by Japan.</p>
<p>The "South Manchuria Railway Company" was established in the year after the Russo-Japanese War (Meiji 40). Over the past 50 years, starting with coal mining, it has gradually expanded into various affiliated industries, forming a complete system. Initially, there were three pits: "Qianjin Pass," "Yangbaipu," and "Laohutai." Later, two new pits, "Dashan" and "Togo," were opened. Subsequently, "Laowan," "Longfeng," and others were gradually added, totaling eight pits, increasing production from 300 tons per day to 30,000 tons.</p>
<p>The entire mining area is 17 kilometers east-west and 4 kilometers north-south, with an area of 60.16 million square feet. The geological age is Tertiary coal seam, which becomes thicker towards the west, with the thickest part being 125 meters and the thinnest part being 15 meters. The coal quality is bituminous coal with long flames, with a specific gravity of 1.27 and an average calorific value of 6,960 calories. It is indeed a high-quality chemical raw material coal - low-temperature distillation, pharmaceuticals, dyes, light and heavy oils, combustible gases, ammonia, and so on are all contained within it.</p>
<p>Fushun is not only a coal and mechanical city, but also has highly developed affiliated industries. The first to be established was the oil shale distillation plant (oil production plant). Six or seven years later, an ironmaking plant was established, followed by a liquefaction plant, a lead production plant (light metals), an electrolysis plant (producing hydrogen and oxygen), calcium carbide production, and a water gas plant.</p>
<p>Other small factories, such as a sulfuric acid plant (absorbing ammonia gas from low-temperature distillation to produce sulfuric acid fertilizer), a black explosive plant, a refractory brick plant, and a coking plant, were all for the utilization of by-products, mostly small-scale manufacturing, for the use of the coal mine itself.</p>
<p>Of particular note is the "Machinery Factory," which is large in scale and well-equipped. Also noteworthy is the "Power Plant," which originally had a power generation capacity of 210,000 KW. Because 70% of the machinery was dismantled by a certain party, it can now only generate 50,000 KW. There is also a "Chemical Research Institute," which is also worth mentioning. By the time of the Japanese surrender, 15 major topics had been researched and contributed to enterprise chemistry. The equipment is also excellent. Then there is the coal mine hospital, which is probably comparable to the "Peking Union Medical College Hospital." In the past, graduates of the "South Manchuria Medical College" had to go through this hospital's internship to graduate, thus becoming the only training institution for medical talents in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Restorative Power</p>
<p>Fushun city is a metropolis of 200,000 to 300,000 people. In addition to 200,5654 Chinese people, there are 7,131 Japanese, 3,213 Koreans, and 12 other foreigners, totaling 210,6010 people.</p>
<p>Fushun has a total of approximately 3,600 stores, most of which can still be maintained. In addition to the Central Bank, financial institutions such as the Farmers Bank, China Bank, and Bank of Communications have also established branches. In addition, there are three private commercial banks.</p>
<p>Today, the recovery of industry and commerce is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what it used to be. Of the original 349 factories, including 83 larger ones, only 50-odd have resumed operations. Coal production is also only one-sixth of its former total production.</p>
<p>The people of Fushun have some criticisms about the Fushun Coal Mine, which was taken over by the Assets Committee. They say that the directors of the coal mine come and go, and they cannot devote their full strength to the work. In addition, some of the personnel taking over are too far removed from the workers, and their lives are not integrated, creating a gap due to the disparity in salaries. Moreover, the number of administrative staff is gradually increasing, while the number of workers actually doing the work is decreasing. This affects the work, weakens productivity, and also hides the crisis of labor unrest. We sincerely hope for reasonable improvements. Any negligence would be too great a mistake.</p>
<p>For the sake of Fushun, and also for the sake of Liaoning, for the sake of the entire Northeast and China, we must make the whole country pay attention to Fushun, restore and strengthen Fushun's coal mines and all industries. The people of Fushun even hope to set up the capital of Liaoning Province in Fushun, because putting a province's political center here may increase the power to restore Fushun!</p>

<p>Intermarriage with Foreigners - Paris, 6th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Hong Fu</p>
<p>In the "Free Talk" column of this newspaper on November 8th of the 35th year, under the title "Thinking of Zhaojun," one example was used to illustrate that the qualities and virtues of Chinese and foreigners are fundamentally different. According to the practice of Chinese women marrying foreigners, Wang Zhaojun set the precedent. The English term for intermarriage is Exogamy, derived from Greek, while the term for bigamy is bigamy, which is the opposite of monogamy. Polygamy is called Polygamy, and polyandry is called Ply-andry. The material civilization of the West is indeed amazing, but unfortunately, the foundation of its spiritual civilization is far inferior to that of China. Its people do not know how to "endure" what others cannot endure, and a small encounter with a storm can easily turn into an incredible joke. Westerners only know Ego-ism and only seek the pleasure of the moment. However, the chastity, filial piety, and martyrdom of our Chinese are all Altru-ism, which is a special glory in the spiritual realm and cannot be understood by Westerners. During the Second European War, 50,000 Dutch women married Canadian soldiers, and France had 200,000 women without masters. More than 20,000 of them were formally married to foreign soldiers, and more than 30,000 sons and daughters had to be housed in mutual shelters. Earlier, when German soldiers occupied France, French men fled, and the remaining women mostly had affairs with German soldiers. Later, after the Germans retreated, they mated with American soldiers, resulting in more than 7,000 new brides who had to cross the ocean to America. Some of them divorced shortly after marriage. In Germany, the children born to German women and Allied soldiers had a larger appetite than ordinary German children. German women were unable to support them and often sold them to the government. German women in labor camps who became pregnant during the war often had surgical abortions. Western women often promiscuously intermingle with different sexes. In the European and American universities I have visited, except for American women who still value their reputations, there are no restrictions in Europe, and the rampant desires of people often make those who cherish self-love sigh that they cannot get close. If a young man with a weak will encounters this environment, how can his studies and future not be affected? As for single male overseas Chinese traveling far away, their environment is not as pure as that of university students. During this long Second European War, their intermarriage with foreigners was done without any discernment of the other party. If there is a divorce, the resulting disputes and lawsuits will cause more losses, which is even more unimaginable. On the other hand, in the home country, the hair wives who have remained loyal for decades are left helpless and unable to seek help. Our government, Hu Fu, has considered this and is making progress for the families of these people, opening up wisdom and planning a way out, slightly following the Japanese-style overseas Chinese training center and emulating the New World education plan, so that all these women can easily achieve beautification and youthful transformation. This move is of great concern in terms of national economy and people's livelihood. I personally believe that for the sake of both parties, it is still appropriate to amend the law so that lost overseas children can still repent and approach their old families. I recall 36 years ago, I happened to see a question posted in the Shanghai Shenzhou Daily, soliciting answers from readers, which meant, "Why do women only love one person?" The answers at the time were like a forest, mostly beating around the bush. I intended to answer, "Love is the life of women, while men value their careers throughout their lives. Most ordinary men call the lack of love a small part of their lives." If a man is only focused on profit, no matter what, it is not difficult to take care of the original family in his hometown. However, when thinking about the last hope of life, the purely blooded children are trustworthy. In general, mixed-race children may have sufficient intelligence, but their morals are not as high as those of pure blood. Today's villagers still inevitably marry those who are more closely related, and the children born are less intelligent but uniquely virtuous. Children born in big cities are prone to mixed blood, and their morals are not as high as those of villagers. The great figures of today are often born to benefit the masses, and this is all solid proof that pure blood is far better than mixed blood. Those who plan the country must not neglect this.</p>
<p>A wealthy overseas Chinese man died during the war and left a will specifying that 10% of his Chinese hair wife should transport the coffin back to China and set aside a fixed amount of repayment for use. 10% of his children born to foreign women fought for this money and committed a crime: they stole their father's body and burned it. Westerners believe in nothing, and this is one example. A certain wealthy Western businessman left instructions after his death to extract a huge sum from his estate to purchase a valuable boulder as a memorial. His intention was naturally to refer to the tombstone. Unexpectedly, his son not only inherited the estate but also coveted this huge sum of money and wanted to hunt it for himself. He consulted with a senior lawyer and suddenly came up with a clever plan, which was to put a diamond ring commemorating his father on his finger, because a diamond is also a stone. The stone mentioned in the will did not have any annotations, and it was not said that it must be placed in front of the tomb. This is a humorous story about a will. I write it down so that people can smile.</p>
<h3>The First Shot of Overseas Chinese Returning to Invest: Developing the Economy of Fujian</h3>
<p>— Thirteenth Day Airmail News, Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu from Fuzhou</p>
<p>We in the country have a direct impression of overseas Chinese living around the world, thinking that they all have strong, dark bodies, an aptitude for abacus skills, and countless banknotes, as if they were all bright stars of wealth. In fact, people in the country only see the wealthy side of overseas Chinese and do not see the miserable circumstances of their lives abroad! They are dependent on others, suffering from the exclusion of indigenous peoples and all kinds of harsh treatments from local governments, often toiling all year round without enough to eat. Most of the compatriots who have drifted overseas are in dire straits in their home country. They rely on their only carrying pole as a tool for making a living, enduring years of wind and frost, working diligently and thriftily to build a business, and a lucky few have smooth sailing and their careers are booming, leaping into the ranks of big capitalists. For example, Mr. Wang Zhenxiang, one of the founders of the Fujian Economic Construction Company, was once a miner, and now owns thirteen large companies in various ports in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>"Chang'an is not a place to stay for long" - Investing in and Developing the Hometown</p>
<p>After the end of the war, a wave of national self-determination movements was brewing in various parts of Southeast Asia. Major conflicts, such as those in the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, meant that the lives and property of overseas Chinese were not guaranteed, and many died unjustly in foreign lands. Moreover, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the tragic experiences of overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia were unbearable to recount. The overseas Chinese, based on their years of accumulated experience, knew that although Chang'an was good, it was not a place to stay for long. Being dependent on others was ultimately painful, so it was better to find ways to move their large amounts of capital and businesses operating in various parts of Southeast Asia back to the motherland, to revitalize the war-torn motherland.</p>
<p>Fujian-born overseas leaders Hu Wenhu and Malaysian representatives Huang Chongji, Lin Qingnian, Wang Zhenxiang, He Baoren, Philippine representative Xue Fenshi, Dutch East Indies representative Huang Chaolong, Vietnamese Chen Zhaoji, Siamese Su Zhensheng, Burmese Li Liangyuan, and others agreed to cooperate in investing in and developing the economy of Fujian. They put forward the slogans of "concentrating efforts to build the hometown" and "building the hometown is building the country," and organized the Fujian Economic Construction Company. On November 15th of last year, the inaugural meeting was held in the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce. More than seventy founders representing five million overseas Chinese from various parts of Southeast Asia attended. Party and government authorities from Fujian Province also attended the meeting, marking the beginning of overseas Chinese returning to invest. The atmosphere was excited, demonstrating a new atmosphere of unprecedented unity in the overseas Chinese community. The overseas leaders all agreed that they could not survive without building a prosperous, strong, and happy homeland. They requested the government to provide assistance and guarantee their rights. Liu Shengxi, the representative of the provincial government, solemnly stated that the government was willing to provide technical assistance and security guarantees.</p>
<p>Overseas Leaders Raising Funds Separately, Drafting Business Plans</p>
<p>After the closing of the inaugural meeting, a preparatory committee was established, with Hu Wenhu appointed as a standing committee member, and Shi Xingshui, Wang Zhenxiang, Huang Chongji, and more than a hundred others as members of the company's preparatory committee. They planned fundraising matters separately, deciding that the total amount of the company's funds would be 30 billion, allocated as follows: (1) 10 billion from Malaysia, which has already been oversubscribed (including 4.5 billion from Singapore, 1.2 billion from Perak, 1 billion each from Selangor, Penang, and Johor, 300 million each from Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang, 200 million from Kedah and Perlis combined, and 100 million each from Kelantan and Terengganu), (2) 10 billion from the Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Burma, Vietnam, and Siam combined, (3) 10 billion from within the province and Hong Kong and Shanghai combined, to be raised in three phases. It is expected that fundraising in various parts of Southeast Asia will be easier than within the province, but the remittance of large amounts of funds will face some difficulties due to different exchange rates in various places and restrictions on overseas remittances in the places where overseas Chinese reside. Regarding the remittance bank, the preparatory committee carefully decided to mainly use the Central Bank, the Fujian Provincial Bank, and the Overseas Chinese Bank. Representatives Hu Wenhu, He Baoren, Huang Chongji, Lin Qingnian, and others were sent to Beijing to contact the central government, requesting special approval to establish a construction bank to handle overseas remittances and mortgage business, as a bridge for overseas Chinese investment.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Economic Construction Company will be located in Xiamen, and branches will be established inside and outside the province as necessary. In addition to the construction bank as the main business, it will also establish industrial and mining, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, salt, and transportation enterprises in the province, paying particular attention to supporting the trade of Fujian's special products and the development of industrial and mining, in order to gradually guide Fujian towards industrialization.</p>
<p>Xiamen Can Build a Good Harbor, Constructing the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Economic Construction Company's preparatory committee at the end of last year, Fuzhou and Xiamen have been filled with a construction boom. What lingers in the minds of the upper class is how to guide more overseas capital to develop Fujian's rich resources. The company's founders have received many suggestions and plans, some saying that transportation is the most important, some saying that a bank should be established first, with different opinions and each having its own reason. Minister Bai Chongxi once discussed the future status of Xiamen from a national defense perspective, which actually surpasses Shanghai. Xiamen is the hub of the Southeast Asian sea route, where ships from five continents and merchants from all over the world gather. The port of Xiamen is the best port in the south, capable of accommodating giant ships of 30,000 tons. It is worth developing. Minister Wang Yunwu believes from an economic standpoint that to compete for the Southeast Asian market, it is necessary to complete the railway extending from the coastal ports to the hinterland. Chen Tirong, the first director of the Construction Department of Fujian Province, once loudly appealed for the importance of constructing the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the north, which has been approved in principle by the central government, and the investment of 35 million US dollars from a Canadian manufacturer. He requested the Economic Construction Company to invest 10% of its capital in the railway company. In addition, people in the province believe that developing the hydropower generation of Nengting in Gutian and Jiulihu in Xianyou can induce the rise of countless small industries and give ample opportunities for the development of Fujian's textile, printing, hardware, and electrical appliance manufacturing industries. Some say that supporting the trade of special products is a shortcut to profit. The Fujian media have also published articles expressing their views, forming a wave of provincial construction movements.</p>
<p>What the Future Holds, Still Awaiting the Cooperation of Overseas Leaders</p>
<p>Many of these founders of the Economic Construction Company have private enterprises in Southeast Asia, and they are large in scale. After the inaugural meeting, most of the overseas leaders returned to their original places, reportedly to raise funds or prepare to move their businesses back to the country. Among these overseas leaders, some were originally miners and are very interested in the iron mines of Anxi, Fujian. Some have always been traders and advocate large-scale investment in the trade of special products in Zhabei. Some operate textile industries and are willing to invest in the textile industry in the Longxi area. Some are engaged in shipping and believe that developing coastal shipping is the top priority. Each has their own ambitions and pursuits, which may disperse the company's strength. It is crucial to select the essentials and proceed in order, which is the key to construction. This requires the cooperation of overseas leaders and a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>It is said that the company's funds have reached 20 billion yuan, and the founding meeting will be held in Xiamen on April 1st to announce the official establishment of the company and begin the implementation of the approved plans. We hope that the establishment of the Fujian Economic Construction Company can truly do a few things, and that the local government will provide assistance, as a beginning of the movement of overseas Chinese returning to invest, using the abundant funds of overseas Chinese to revive this motherland that has suffered long-term disasters.</p>
<h3>The National Archives of the United States</h3>
<p>— New York, Eighth Day Airmail News, Li Dongfang</p>
<p>With a letter of introduction from Dr. Hermay, I visited Mr. Solon J. Buck, and told him: I am an honorary advisor to the National History Museum of China and have conducted research at the National Archives of France for four years. Mr. Buck is the director of the National Archives of the United States, and he was very excited when he heard what I said. He asked me why I was unwilling to stay in Washington for a few more days so we could talk at length. I, a lonely wanderer, had to rush to the Northeast to teach.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Mr. Buck and his assistants for taking the time to show me around the various departments of the Archives. Compared to the one in Paris, the equipment and organization are truly surpassing. What makes me most happy is the special disinfection department in the basement. All documents entering the Archives, whether they have insects or not, are treated. I think people who come here to bury themselves in old papers will no longer feel itchy. I want to write a special letter to the old director in Paris, but I am afraid he will misunderstand.</p>
<p>What I also admire is that the Americans spare no expense (actually, not much money) to mount the documents with blurry handwriting, fragile or particularly precious, on transparent paper, but without using paste, but using chemical and physical methods. The chemical method makes the transparent paper sticky, and the physical method tightens it with force. Why don't we transport our ancient books and historical materials here and mount them all like this? Or should I buy a machine and bring it back to China? (It's very cheap and there is no commission.)</p>
<p>They have money, needless to say. They specially built a Western-style building (becoming one of the famous attractions of Washington, D.C.), with each floor and each room having a special designated task. The exhibition hall on the second floor is very large, with valuable materials on display regularly. What I encountered was the ten definitive amendments to the Constitution, and the letter of credence from a certain envoy of the Great Qing Empire (with dragons surrounding, a combination of Chinese and Manchu, not written in English, with a golden silk and vermilion seal). The reading room has two rooms, east and west, and a catalog room in the middle. There is a separate room for those who want to type or take photos, so as not to disturb others. (The French still do not allow typing in the archives.) The place where the scrolls are stored is completely steel doors and cement walls, so in case of fire, only one room will burn. If a fire really breaks out, even if it is only one room, it would be too embarrassing. I think this building will not catch fire unless something falls from the sky. In Paris, the scrolls are stored in paper boxes, while in the United States, they are stored in flat and large steel drawers. In addition to the reading room, there is also a small library, with 65,000 books related to American history and various social sciences placed on the shelves for you to browse at any time. There are also two historians, called historical commissioners, who are permanent living dictionaries. If there is anything you don't understand or have forgotten, just ask them. Their job is to provide you with information. There are also times when they can't answer, but they never get angry, but are happy to ask more knowledgeable friends or arrange for you to meet their friends. — I think anyone can come here to do research and easily write a paper on American history.</p>
<p>Their archives, as of now, are 320,000 feet long on the shelves. (The shelves occupy 320,000 feet.) Most of them are kept by the State Department before this museum was established in 1935. All outdated files from Congress, courts, and administrative departments are concentrated here. Each agency can still borrow them back when they need to refer to them at any time.</p>
<p>I remember that when the Nationalist Government was still in Chongqing, most agencies suffered from small air-raid shelters and could not store their files, so they often burned slightly outdated files. Later, the preparatory office of the National History Museum learned about this and sent a letter to everyone, asking them to let the preparatory office of the National History Museum send someone to take a look before burning them and choose important ones to bring back for preservation. This was truly a rescue. Fortunately, even though not many agencies were willing to allow people to rescue in this way, at least those files that were burned were spiritually comforted.</p>
<p>I often emphasize how the Han Dynasty valued archives, and the account books of each state and county had to be sent to the Grand Historian in the original copy, and only the copy was sent to the Prime Minister. Today, it is difficult for China's National History Museum to explain such a pedantic method to various agencies. If we do not cite our own worthless ancient history, but cite the invaluable American example that everyone admires in all aspects, perhaps the various agencies will immediately follow suit. To put it bluntly, whether a nation has a soul, or whether its soul is lost, depends on its attitude towards archives.</p>
<p>Our National History Museum should really be renamed the National Archives. Because official history compilation is neither in line with the trend, nor have we actually compiled any "veritable records" in the way that the national history museums of previous dynasties did. The government can expand the National History Museum into a National Archives, which can both collect the archives of various agencies, facilitate inspection, and help scholars who are willing to write history, allowing everyone to write freely based on authentic materials.</p>
<p>A person who studies modern Chinese history cannot but come to the American National Archives to search, because the American ministers and consulates stationed in China have regular reports back to the country, and all are collected here. If we can add a lot of new knowledge about Hong Xiuquan, Li Hongzhang, Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to paper materials, this museum also has gramophone records and sound films. President Wilson's voice and appearance have disappeared, but his voice is still there. If there had been such an idealist on the international stage after World War II, perhaps things would not have been so bad today! This is a campaign speech. Roosevelt also has several speeches stored here. Why not also preserve the records of the Yalta and Tehran conferences? Under the film category, most are Movietone newsreels. However, yesterday's news is today's history. One genuine film is the most famous, it is the first film in history, starring Mary Pickford, and was personally given to this museum by this empress dowager. Ford also sent a film about manufacturing cars.</p>
<p>American history is not long, but compared to us, it seems that there is more historical material than we have. Is it because they are better, or are we not good enough?</p>
<h3>A World-Class Orchard: The Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Branch</h3>
<p>— Eighth Day Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>The Agricultural Experiment Institute, which is directly under the Governor-General's Office, has a total of ten branches throughout the province. Chiayi is located in the center of the western plain, right on the Tropic of Cancer, making it an ideal place for agricultural experiments. Therefore, a branch has also been established in Shanziding Park and has been maintained for twenty-eight years. Sweet potato improvement is coordinated with military needs. In the past, the scope of work of the institute was very broad, but in recent years it has gradually reduced and focused all its efforts on the improvement and research of sweet potatoes. According to Yang Shourin, the director of the branch, this work is not only well known to the people of the entire province, but also has a very important position in the Far East. According to the results of the experiments here, sweet potatoes can be planted all year round, shortening the breeding period, and flowering is normal, so hybridization methods can be used to improve them. The most interesting thing is that sweet potatoes also have seeds that can be planted.</p>
<p>Before sweet potatoes were studied and experimented here, the starch content of the sweet potatoes produced locally was only 15% to 18%. However, after using the improved varieties here, the sweet potatoes that grew had a starch content of more than 30%. More than 80% of the farmers near Chiayi have now completely adopted the improved varieties. During the war, the Japanese built a large-scale alcohol factory here, the fourth largest in East Asia, to supply fuel for combat as much as possible. The raw material was the sweet potatoes produced here. If the starch content was not above 30%, this factory could not be used. The coordination of agricultural research and military needs cannot but be said to be the success of Japan and is worthy of our vigilance.</p>
<p>"Queen of Fruits": A Lifelong Regret of the Empress</p>
<p>In addition to the extremely successful research on sweet potatoes, the orchard here is also quite famous. Out of more than 200 acres of experimental land, fruit trees occupy two-fifths, with 121 species and more than 260 varieties. At the end of the war, this place was full of cavalry and air-raid shelters were built everywhere, resulting in great losses. After ten months of sorting out after the takeover, the houses have been completely renovated, and the valuable records of the past will soon be published. Now there are a total of four fruit gardens: including a pineapple garden with more than 30 improved varieties from all over the world, a coffee garden, a Sapodilla garden, and a mango garden. Among them, the mangoes did not have the flavor of those produced in the Philippines because the temperature was not high enough, so the institute has recognized that it has failed. On many other plots of land, various famous and precious fruit trees are planted separately. There is a kind called Mangosteen, with red skin and white flesh, and excellent color, aroma, and taste, called the Queen of Fruits, originally from Singapore, but it has never borne fruit. Empress Victoria regarded it as the honor of the British Empire because there were such products in her territories, but she still thought about it until she died and regretted not being able to taste it in her whole life. The four or five plants planted here have not borne fruit for fifteen years, but they actually bore two fruits last year, which is a great event after the recovery of Taiwan Province. Governor Chen Yi specially named it "Feng Guo" (Phoenix Fruit).</p>
<p>Olive Oil Extraction: Seeing if It Can Become a National Treasure</p>
<p>Director Yang also led the reporter to visit many rare fruit trees: (Sapodilla), produced in South America, the fruit is very sweet, and the white juice is very sticky, and it is usually used as a raw material for gummy candies. The Japanese used to value this fruit very much, and they only used it as a generous gift to the Emperor every year. The "King of Fruits" (Klngof fruits) avocado is a product of Hawaii. The fruit has a sweet milky taste. It was badly damaged three years ago, but it has now been restored, and one has been picked and displayed as a specimen. The small flowers of the cocoa tree bloom on the trunk and then bear fruit. The Japanese were initially baffled and actually pruned the flowers below. Now there are only a few fruits on the upper part. The fruit of Cnistel is similar to mango, but the strange thing is that the flesh is egg-yolk colored and tastes like egg yolk. Mexican Malabar is very rare in the world. The fruit is like a chestnut and can be stir-fried and eaten. The greatest function is that the roots are thicker than the stems and spread widely, making it an ideal windbreak tree. Many engineering agencies in Taiwan Province have come here to request transplantation. Professor Hoskinson of the University of California in the United States has also visited here. Mexico is very close to California, but he said that he has never seen such a good windbreak tree. Ceylon olives fall all over the ground. Director Yang said that he is now studying its composition to see if it can extract the same lubricating oil as in the fruits of the Mediterranean olive tree. All precision machinery cannot do without this oil. Germany's only request from Turkey during the war was this thing. If our research can be successful, it will be no different from a "national treasure."</p>

<h3>World-Famous Book Charity Exhibition: The Basis for Appreciating Western Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>So-called Western paintings generally refer to oil paintings, watercolors, and sketches. In fact, this is distinguished from the material, if divided by form, can be distinguished into murals, framed paintings, and sketches, divided by content, it can be divided into still lifes, landscapes, animals, and people.</p>
<p>Because the origin of Western art comes from the humanistic and realistic spirit of ancient Greece, after the middle ages, the Renaissance advocating the revival of the ancient Greek spirit came, Western art returned to reality, so the traditional spirit of Western painting is realism. We appreciating it, must pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>The realistic technique is due to the foundation of sketching. The so-called basic sketch usually refers to charcoal, because it can practice depicting the accuracy of the outline, and from a simple color, it is easy to express the complex colors of the object and become a different tone of light and dark. Therefore, a good Western painting should have a solid sketch technique. This can be proved at any time in the works of ancient masters or modern writers.</p>
<p>Works with a basic sketch have an accurate tone when applying color. The so-called tone includes light and dark, strength and weakness, and lightness and heaviness. When we appreciate a good Western painting, we feel that the tone is well controlled, and the reflection of one part and another is harmonious and responsive, with no stiff or abrupt feeling at all.</p>
<p>Regarding the color in Western paintings, the style of the Venetian school in Italy during the Renaissance period was particularly exquisite. This style influenced the French romanticism two centuries later, just as the Florentine school, which emphasized form and ingenuity, influenced the classicism of the nineteenth century; the color of naturalism is the hint of the color and light research of the later Impressionism, although it did not study color scientifically like the Impressionists, it also knew that the change of color is the shift of sunlight. The Impressionists were so happy with the selection of colors because they were influenced by this. Monet's series of "Water Lilies" and "Haystacks" can be said to have thoroughly implemented the attempt of naturalism, and the picture is full of the color feeling under the sunlight. The Neo-Impressionists did more thorough color research, they analyzed sunlight, negated shadows, paid attention to the reflection of color and color, and as a result, used simple primary color dots to depict the unpredictable sunlight, the so-called "pointillism", not to mix colors on the palette but to mix colors on the retina of the eye, this is the result of scientific development, and it is not the most advanced method of color application in Western paintings? The colors of twentieth-century new and wall paintings have been studied even more deeply, and we want to talk about it in another article.</p>
<p>The important condition of Western painting is realism, and the technique is to study sketching and color, and even to study the perspective of objects in the distance, the anatomy of the human body, etc., it can be said that all are for the sake of realism. However, simply relying on the realism of the two parts of the object without cleverly arranging the object on the picture, it loses the artistic meaning, so appreciating Western painting, we must also pay attention to the composition of the picture, that is, the proper arrangement and layout of the objects.</p>
<p>The best way to arrange is balance, which is to make the objects on the picture not feel that one side is more or less, this must also pay attention to the control of color, that is the question of tone.</p>
<p>In composition, we should also pay attention to a picture, there should be a center, and other things should be to the center, but it cannot be rigid or chaotic, the best example is Da Vinci's composition of "The Last Supper", we should appreciate the hard work of this artist who controlled thirteen people to achieve the "change and unity" on this painting.</p>
<p>Finally, we should also pay attention to the application of materials, oil painting is thick, but thick coating and thin coating, the effect is completely different, watercolor has a light and cheerful interest, color powder has an ethereal interest. Regarding brush techniques, such as flat coating, clumps, pointillism, and thick lines, smooth surfaces, the effects are different, and we should also pay attention to them when appreciating Western paintings.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 181</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"No need to go to such great lengths." Kiken Shinichi said, "Although I haven't had in-depth research on this, I still understand a little bit about the basics. That Pingzi is still a defeated pawn of mine." Taking this opportunity, Tsurumi briefly explained the scene at Matsushima Beach with the various Pingzi methods (occult arts).</p>
<p>"From the looks of it, this Miss Pingzi's resistance isn't that strong – since she's Aoki's mature medium, it'll be easy for me to transmit the telepathy of you two old brothers... The most important thing is the timing for Shi and Li – it must be when she's mentally weakened or resting." Lai-kun is also an expert.</p>
<p>After Mr. W finished speaking, the four of us looked at each other and smiled, and the inexplicably confused Hu Cheng, influenced by our smiles, also laughed confusedly along with us.</p>
<p>We carefully deliberated and chose to implement this plan around three o'clock in the morning; the reason being, we'd finish abruptly suspending [the plan] at midnight, rest for two hours, and then arrange the various conditions for performing the ritual from two to three o'clock. However, because I'm tied up with military affairs and various trivial matters, I've abandoned the practice of unifying my spirit for many days; this action definitely has a meaning of taking risks and seeking luck. Why do I say it's taking risks? Because if our counter-sent telepathy is resisted by the opponent, or even strongly controlled by the opponent's spirit, our spirits will be greatly affected. To put it bluntly, my and Kiken's nerves might be damaged; at best, we'll suffer from periodic headaches, and at worst, both of us will go crazy.</p>
<p>In total, the plan we discussed this evening is divided into three and a half steps: First, from eight to nine o'clock, Tsurumi will go out alone to the Beiping headquarters to gather enemy intelligence, and also to "falsely convey the imperial edict," fabricating a secret order from Konoe, a measure of "attacking the mind as the best strategy."</p>
<p>This method is the "deceiving the heavens to cross the sea" tactic that Tsurumi planned. The intention is to build a protective city for the people of Beiping; to save them from being massacred as "fish in the moat" after we launch our attack.</p>
<p>Will this method work? Will people like Matsui and Sakai, who have the backing of Song, Lan, Mei, and the Black Dragon Society, take Tsurumi's personal secret telegram to heart? Little do they know, there's a small arrangement hidden within. Before eight o'clock, Tsurumi has to draft a report on the situation in Beiping, half-true and half-false, and have the General Staff Headquarters forward it to Konoe, saying that the Beiping expeditionary "imperial army" is planning a massacre of the city. The massacre may be a fabrication, but the indiscriminate arrest of many "unstable elements" is a fact. At the same time, he'll advise Konoe to order Matsui to be responsible for winning back the people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Jottings on Bookplates</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Small and precious paper is called a "jian" [note paper]. In Europe and America, gentlemen and ladies use bookplates in their books, pasting them on the first page with their names inscribed. Even if it's followed by the Latin phrase "Ex libris...from the library of...", the English term for the bookplate is "Book-Plate," and they are always as elaborately decorated and intricately painted as Chinese paintings, unlike the simple labels on the covers of traditional thread-bound books, which only have text and no illustrations. Throughout my life, I have served on delegations, and encountered rare and precious items. Through extensive searching and collecting, I have acquired a fleeting glimpse of Western craftsmanship. Among the things that best showcase the special features of European and American printing and art, the "war bookplate" is the most valuable. In Western society, the cost and effort of designing, drawing, and printing a bookplate can easily exceed ten British pounds. Later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, conventional thinking had not yet escaped the constraints of the Middle Ages. The bookplates of famous and wealthy families were limited to their existing family crests, lacking any new and captivating designs. In the recent century, global transportation has become increasingly developed, and various industries and academic fields have emerged. The variety of bookplates is limitless. A single print run can be as small as a thousand copies or as large as tens of thousands. The paper size of a bookplate is roughly the same as a Chinese seal. The largest can be 11 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide, while the smallest is 2 centimeters in both length and width. The illustrations and text used on bookplates can be exemplified in the following ways: Some interweave the initials of the name into a clever phrase, similar to the Chinese practice of embedding characters in a couplet. For example, the bookplate of the famous Dutch publisher Albert Willem Sijthoff, beneath the ownership inscription, adds the motto "Altijdt Waeck-saem" [Always Vigilant], comparable to the Chinese couplet "Sunset Mountain scenery crosses dangerous cliffs, Beautiful sunny light ascends small building", a perfect match. Another Westerner named Hazeloop has a bookplate depicting a fast-running rabbit, with the inscription: "May this book quickly return to its original owner, like a rabbit escaping in flight (as shown in Figure 1)". Another bookplate depicts a bookshelf with a missing book in the middle, as if someone has just taken it away, with the text: "My bookshelf is precisely missing this volume". This allows the reader to see the illustration and understand the meaning, promptly returning the book to its original owner after reading it. Another bookplate also depicts a bookshelf with a missing book (as shown in Figure 2), with the inscription: "Return this book to me quickly, send it to A.R. Bake, If you don't return it, will your conscience be clear?". Ingeniously conceived, full of playful interest. Some bookplates use the family name of the owner as the basis for the design. For example, the bookplate of someone named Wijs depicts an owl, a symbol of wisdom. (as shown in Figure 3). The bookplate of someone named Winterink depicts a winter scene with snow and wind. (as shown in Figure 4). The bookplate of someone named Mus depicts a sparrow on a branch. (as shown in Figure 5). Bookplates that express national characteristics, such as the Tree of Life and two deer, are traditional Germanic symbols (see Figure 6). I think that Chinese historical achievements are most splendid in the Han and Tang dynasties. If someone wanted to commemorate the glory of the Han people, they could depict the thousand-mile horse that General Li Guangli obtained from his western expeditions during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. This bookplate would be especially suitable for military officers with the surname Li. Some bookplates represent a profession or occupation. For example, a snake representing the medical profession, with a microscope inside a heart-shaped outline, immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a doctor. A book depicting a legal official in robes, with a weeping woman being accused in front of him, immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a lawyer (as shown in Figures 7 and 8). A bookplate depicting overflowing books and mixed manuscripts on a desk (see Figure 9) immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a library expert. If a Chinese librarian were to design a bookplate, it would be appropriate to depict Lao Tzu, who once served as a historian. Finally, bookplates related to the owner's experiences and hobbies could depict a round-the-world sailor like the immortal astronaut Wu Gang who shares my last name, with the osmanthus tree and the moon, or a boat, or a woman swimmer, or the subtle floral patterns and bird shadows on my [own bookplate]. (as shown in Figure 10).</p>
<h3>A Record of Zhang Shuqi: Ten Points Talent, Ten Points Effort</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiji</p>
<p>The seventeenth Literary Tea Party was held at the Guanshengyuan in Nanjing. Literary figures gathered together to welcome Professor Zhang Shuqi, a contemporary master of flower-and-bird painting, who recently returned to China from the United States with honor. Looking back six years ago, during the most difficult period of our country's resistance against Japan, Shuqi was ordered to go to the United States to study art and hold personal exhibitions. From the standpoint of national diplomacy, he promoted Chinese art and gave the Chinese nation a breath of fresh air, which is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In the past half century, China has cultivated no less than thousands of talents in science, and the price paid is incalculable. It cannot be said that scientists have made no contributions, but science, industrialization, and electrification, etc., are just hearing the sound of stairs but not seeing anyone come down. Of course, the reasons are complicated. When it comes to inventions and creations that are manifested in reality, although they are not castles in the air, they are also as elusive as immortals. I dare to boldly assert that the literary and artistic writers who are slightly prominent in the international arena and can win a place should be considered the least important. Shuqi is one of them.</p>
<p>During his six years in the United States, he held dozens of personal exhibitions of Chinese paintings in Washington, Chicago, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and major cities such as Toronto, Canada, traversing the North and South American continents. He was invited by various universities, art museums, and museums to lecture on Chinese art and wield his brush, using his refined skills, as quickly as wind and rain, completing a painting in a short time. People from all walks of life were amazed and praised his superb skills. Newspapers headlined "A Chinese Masterpiece in Ten Minutes" (A. Chinese Masterpiece in Iominites). His success was not accidental, just as the famous inventor Edison said, "One point of genius still depends on ninety-nine points of effort," not to mention that he really has ten points of genius, plus ten points of effort.</p>
<p>Chinese flower-and-bird painting originated in the Tang and Five Dynasties, developed in the Song Dynasty, changed in the Yuan Dynasty, and reached its peak in the Ming and Qing Dynasties; however, the painters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties inherited the legacy of the Five Dynasties and the Two Songs, followed the norms of their predecessors, and lacked creativity.</p>
<p>Shuqi's paintings learn from nature and delve into nature. He is "ingenious in his conception," proficient in both meticulous and freehand styles, breaking through the barriers of the ancients and able to create his own style. His attainments and success are truly a unique and brilliant spectacle in the oriental art world.</p>
<h3>Flowers and Birds</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shuqi</p>
<h3>A Record of Paintings in Xiaxi Garden</h3>
<p>— Busou</p>
<p>The owner of Xiaxi Garden has been fond of calligraphy and painting all his life, and has been addicted to it for fifty years. Li Baiyun said that he loves painting to the bone, and Zhu Zhuyu said that he loves painting like his life. The owner has both. His love of painting has progressed from shallow to deep, from the present to the past; because of the changes, he has lived in Shanghai for ten years, and the calligraphy and paintings he has collected are only fine antiques. Therefore, there are many calligraphy and paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties; he has also obtained famous works from the Later Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin, and Six Dynasties, and can understand the origin and development of painting. For example, Zheng Kangcheng liked to paint plum blossoms, and Lin Hejing should have imitated him; Guan Yunchang was good at painting red bamboo, and Yan Zhenqing also imitated him a lot; the transmission of the lineage has its own origin. Zhang Huanhou was skilled in writing elephants, such as figures, flowers, birds, mountains, rocks, and steeds, and there was nothing he could not do; Emperor Zhaolie was good at painting pine and plum, Sun Shangxiang painted daffodils and orchids, and Zhuge Liang was good at painting maps and wooden oxen and horses, and also good at painting pine. When people suddenly said this, few would think it was absurd; in fact, the owner personally experienced it, not a vague influence. Therefore, the collections, whether they have been decorated or not, are all extremely exquisite. Today, only a small portion is displayed in the National Painting Garden, not the whole picture. I hope that people with knowledge can appreciate it together. People often say that it is a feast for the eyes, and it may not be in vain to make this trip.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Sun Jing, also known as Cangsou, settled in Jingsha Bixia, Nantong, and has a garden with beautiful scenery, called Xiaxi Garden. Mr. Sun was a filial and virtuous man in his youth, and once served as a representative of a civil organization. He was respected by the late Mr. Zhang Jian, a local sage; during the war, he lived in Shanghai, closed his doors to thank guests, and enjoyed calligraphy and painting, which was admired by the world. Recently, at the advanced age of eighty-one, he still wields his brush every day, and the oracle bone characters he paints are simple and unadorned, close to the ruins of Yin. The collection is rich and magnificent. When we saw the Tang and Song ink paintings, and Liang Kai's paintings, Zha Shibiao's bamboo paintings, etc., they were all well-preserved and worth watching. This public exhibition will definitely have many treasures. Now we have received this article from Qiu Busou and published it as soon as possible to introduce it.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Grand Gathering of Famous Actors in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wenzhen</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang invited more than a hundred fellow practitioners and friends from the Shanghai opera circle, including Feng Gengguang and Xu Boming, to his private residence for tea and snacks on the 20th and 21st of this month to discuss the memorial service for Li Shifang and to decide on the 25th and 26th to hold charity performances at the Guoda Theater to support Li's family. The program includes Mei Bao玥 and Bao玖's "Sitting in the Palace", Li Li from Beiping's "Stealing the Token", Chen Da's "Seeing His Mother at the Pass", Yan Pingzhu and Zhao Peixin's "Returning the Token", and Mei's disciples Wei Yunfang, Yan Xizhu, Li Yuru, Hai Bixia, Gu Zhengqiu, Wang Xichun, Ye Lianfen, etc.'s "Daxi Royal Villa" Ten Beauties Race. According to the instructions of his teacher's wife, Fu Zhifang, after the race, they should not immediately remove their makeup, but each sing a segment of their best work. This is the first day; the second day will feature Mei Bao玖, Bao玥, and Mei's disciples' "Eight-Five Flower Cave", with Cheng Yanqiu as the finale, the play is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In addition, famous actors such as Yuan Shihai, Li Shaochun, Lu Shishan, Li Jinhong, Ai Shiju, Sun Futing, Jiang Miaoxiang, Yu Zhenfei, and Chu Jinqipeng will play important roles in each play, including all the famous actors in Shanghai. Mei himself cannot perform due to his condition. Bao玖 and Bao玥's plays will still be accompanied by Wang Youqing and Ni Qiuping. The memorial service for Shifang will be held on the morning of the 24th at the China Grand Theater. The initiating organizations are the Shanghai Opera Circle Federation, the Shanxi Shanghai Alumni Association, the Fuyuncheng Shanghai Alumni Association, and the disciples of Zhui Wangxuan.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu, Yan Huizhu, and others will perform at the charity performance for Li Shifang's family</p>
<h3>The Declining and Desolate Bird Market</h3>
<p>— Zhuguang</p>
<p>Raising birds, a hobby that scholars and officials competed to pursue thirty years ago to show their "elegance," now only exists in the bird market in the round square in front of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, the teahouse on the upper floor of the Yiyuanlou Teahouse on Zhejiang Road, and the bird shops on Wuma Road, which are full of bamboo cages. Apart from these three places still having traces of "elegance," this hobby, which was once extremely popular and became a fashion, has been almost forgotten by modern people.</p>
<p>On Wuma Road and Zhejiang Road, ten or twenty bird shops are lined up side by side. Since they moved to this area, the golden age of their business has long passed. According to an elderly owner of a bird shop who spoke to a reporter: their heyday was thirty years ago, when the area around the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City God Temple in the Nanshi area was their base camp. No matter whether they were dignitaries or wealthy people, it was not enough to show their power and elegance if they did not raise dozens or even hundreds of colorful birds in their mansions. At that time, slightly more decent wealthy families even had to hire bird keepers who specialized in raising birds.</p>
<p>"The situation is different now," the elder said with a sigh of vicissitudes: "Rich people don't like to play this game anymore. What has replaced it is radios, cinemas, and dance halls. As for those who don't have money, they can't even get enough to eat in these years, so where do they get so much leisure to play with birds!" Filled with melancholy emotions, he came to a conclusion, saying, "In these days, even the birds have suffered!"</p>
<p>Speaking of birds, according to the experts who have been playing with birds for a long time, there are really all kinds of them, with many different names. There are so-called literary birds, such as Java sparrows, white-eyes (so named because the circles around their eyes have black and white lines like embroidery), lovebirds, ten sisters (so named because of their small bodies and beautiful colors), plum blossoms, etc. There are also so-called martial birds, such as thrushes, skylarks, and even the combative yellow-headed birds. In addition, there are myna birds produced in Annam (a kind of parrot, extremely intelligent and good at learning human speech), small parrots, myna birds, sparrows, pigeons, etc. At the same time, each type has several varieties. Taking Java sparrows as an example, there are curly Java sparrows, Dutch Java sparrows, and even snake-headed Java sparrows, which are truly colorful and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Surface Work</h3>
<p>— Jin Ling</p>
<p>Generally, people criticize our administrative officials for paying too much attention to surface work. In fact, it would be good enough if they could really pay attention to surface work, but I'm afraid that they can't even do surface work properly. Yesterday's newspaper reported: Chairman Chiang criticized the municipal administration of the capital at the Central Memorial Week, saying: "Everyone does not pay attention to public health and urinates everywhere, without any order. The capital does not look like a capital, which is despised by foreigners. I don't know what the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Health Department, and the Municipal Government are doing!" This is indeed a big blow to those who can't even do surface work properly.</p>
<p>What is strange is that when Chairman Chiang first flew to the capital after the victory last year, the authorities mobilized a large number of people to build roads and clean streets on the same day, and there were bright slogans and flags everywhere. Nanjing City suddenly became lively. But now, the National Government has returned to Nanjing for nearly a year, and Chairman Chiang has been stationed in Nanjing for a long time, but not only has the surface work not been thoroughly completed, but it is "urinating everywhere" and "the capital does not look like a capital." Is it possible that the so-called surface work is just a temporary show?</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't think surface work should be overly criticized, because no matter how gorgeous clothes a haggard patient wears, he can't hide his pale and thin appearance. A healthy person with developed muscles and a rosy complexion will naturally look very beautiful on the outside, even if he doesn't dress up much. Administrative work is also like this. If you are truly a public servant, how can you ignore the cleanliness of small streets and alleys and damage the health of the people?</p>
<h3>Protest</h3>
<p>— Zifeng</p>
<p>Amid the soaring prices, Wu Kaiguang, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, insisted on implementing a rationing system in order to stabilize the lives of public and educational personnel and gradually suppress prices. This plan was indeed adopted by the government and will be officially implemented in mid-March. The items to be rationed include: rice, flour, yarn, fuel, salt, sugar, cooking oil, and other necessities for everyone's life.</p>
<p>However, the scope of rationing is limited to "public and educational" personnel, while "private education" and "social education" (cultural circles) are all exceptions. The teachers and staff of private schools and cultural workers, who had been eagerly waiting for these days, thinking that they could also get rations, felt greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>In fact, educational personnel are equally responsible for cultivating talents for the country, and cultural personnel are working hard to promote social education, and their lives are no less difficult than those of general public servants and teachers and staff of public schools. However, the treatment they receive from the country is so different...</p>
<p>Here, we dare to lodge a protest!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Fees Under Cleverly Invented Names</h3>
<p>— Zhizhen</p>
<p>Even exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies must have a name, and "inventing clever names" has become the specialty of "corrupt officials".</p>
<p>We dare not say that the schools in Ruizai have already become corrupt, but at least many schools have now been infected with the bad habit of "inventing clever names". The Municipal Council has set the standards for the fees of private primary and secondary schools. Although the principals of primary and secondary schools have published dignified protest letters in the newspapers, they have remained silent due to the order from the Municipal Education Bureau to comply. As a result, one middle school wrote on the tuition bill of high school students: "The fees payable this semester are as follows: Tuition fee 220,000 yuan (in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council), miscellaneous fee 70,000 yuan, health fee 10,000 yuan, compensation deposit 10,000 yuan." The miscellaneous fee is almost one-third of the tuition fee, and the "tuition and miscellaneous fees" actually exceed one-third of the tuition fee.</p>
<p>The authorities of private universities deeply regret that the principals' meeting was held before the rising tide, so that the standard of "a maximum of 500,000 yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees" was set too low (?). In order to "mend the fold after the sheep is lost", in addition to the 500,000 yuan of "tuition and miscellaneous fees", they added a library fee of 20,000 yuan, a sports fee of 10,000 yuan, lecture notes fee...</p>
<p>Let's talk about public schools. A junior high school student studying at the Municipal ×× Middle School, his parents have to pay 20,000 yuan in tuition and 80,000 yuan in miscellaneous fees, and also have to bear "temporarily collected academic training fees for teachers and staff", "supplementary repair fees" and other "miscellaneous fees" totaling 85,000 yuan - more than the "legitimate" miscellaneous fees!</p>
<p>I don't understand the meaning of miscellaneous fees. Judging from the school's tuition bill, it seems that only a few miscellaneous expenses such as rent, water and electricity are omitted. Is it possible that the miscellaneous fees, which account for such a huge proportion of the total amount of fees, are only used to pay these miscellaneous expenses? This seems a bit unreasonable.</p>
<p>The education authorities once stipulated that the salaries of teachers and staff should account for a percentage of the total tuition fees. Now teachers cannot complain about the low salaries, because the "tuition fees" are collected less - teachers are usually not allowed to interfere with the use of miscellaneous fees and "miscellaneous miscellaneous fees".</p>
<p>To pay attention to hygiene, it must be clean; with sports, how can we forget moral education; teachers and staff are not stable in their lives, there is no talk of academic training... I think, soon the school's tuition bill will be added: "cleaning fee", "moral education fee", "teachers and staff living subsidy"...</p>
<h3>Jade Twig Intersection</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>What's so strange about an infant? Depending on each other for life, how helpless and sad! Deformity and perversion, it becomes a debt of misfortune -- a double personality is sold piecemeal, born in an unfortunate new era! New era? There are both "gods" and "monsters" treated in two different ways!</p>
<h3>Ode to Tiger Beating - Feelings After Seeing Untitled Works II</h3>
<p>— Menglong</p>
<p>Man-eating tigers and harmful flies have appeared in the gold market, and the number of people who have been eaten and harmed is countless. Now is the day of total liquidation!</p>
<p>Tigers, who have always been known for eating people, in the past, let alone beating them, it was not even good to talk about them. The so-called "talking about tigers changes color" is also the case. Today, a large number of warriors who go up the mountain to beat tigers have emerged, isn't it wonderful! Admire! Admire!</p>
<p>The determination to beat them has been made, the reasons for beating them have also been resolved, and the steps to beat them must have been arranged long ago, right?</p>
<p>There is only one principle: only beat tigers, not flies. Their integrity and courage cannot be done by non-warriors! But the prerequisite question is whether tigers exist? Where do they exist? Even flies will fly away, can't tigers stage a scene of "tigers leaving the mountain"? If so, then the flies on the heads of the tigers will obviously become "pond fish" after the city gate catches fire.</p>
<p>Flies! Are you motionless, standing as if you are innocent and safe? Will you fly away while humming the old tune of "don't beat flies"? Will you be uneasy about your own safety? This is the sorrow of the flies!</p>
<p>As for the tigers, who are they? Where are they? This is hard to say. Perhaps they have escaped into the deep valley, or gone far away to the absolute peak, or hidden themselves in the swamp. Once they reappear, they will still eat people as usual!</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>The first collection of "Sanmao Joins the Army" comic strips was published yesterday. The second and third collections will be released soon. The book includes 170-180 pictures, exquisitely printed in seven colors on Dowling paper. Each book costs 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xu Wei, the author of "Ghost Love", has been appointed as the editor of the supplement of the Financial Daily. With the seductive power of Xu's past works, he should be able to attract a large number of junior high school girl readers to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Yang Hansheng has not been heard of for a long time for his new works. Recently, he has been burying his head in writing a historical drama (movie script), the title is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Lu Yegao was a member of a drama troupe in a certain army in Jishi, in the rear during the war. He met in Shanghai a few days ago and invited him to go to "Goshman". Who knew that this person was one of the "Four Famous Mountains". He had been arrested and tailed at the time. After arriving at "Goshman", they were arrested together. During the interrogation by the judge that night, after clarifying Lu's identity, he slept with Lu foot to foot and was acquitted the next morning, but he had been greatly frightened.</p>
<p>It is rumored that "China Electric" will be changed to private ownership and each factory will be independent.</p>
<p>The postal workers' drama troupe of the Postal Workers' Union originally planned to perform regularly, but unfortunately it was difficult to find a theater. It negotiated with "Victory" in Hongkou several times, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Fan Lai, who played Shi Dakai in "The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" in "Amateur" performances before the war, has been unemployed since returning to Shanghai after the war. He is staying with his wife and children in "Talmont". Recently, he played an important role in Wu Yonggang's "Welcome Spring", so his frown has eased slightly.</p>
<p>Gao Yang's son has severe pneumonia. The couple took out their gold bars and sought medical treatment everywhere.</p>
<p>Ma Xuweibang is filming "Heaven and Earth Net" (adapted from a stage play) for the Second Factory of China Electric. The entire cast has only six actors, starring Ouyang Hongying.</p>
<p>Zuo Lin will write and direct a film for a certain company. It is said that the content is similar to "Out of the Water Hibiscus", with a funny bathing scene. The male lead is tentatively set as Han Fei.</p>
