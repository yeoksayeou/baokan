<h3>還政于民諾言實現　政府改組宣告完成　府委會通過政院新人選</h3>

<p>〔又電〕國民政府委員會廿三日成立，彭部長學沛頃於中外記者招待會中宣稱。一黨執政，已於今（廿三）日結束，國民黨已實踐其還政於民之諾言，並實現其田訓政到憲政之建國綱領。此項程序已於今晨完成。多黨之國民政府委員會已經正式成立，行政院亦已改組，而包括各黨派與無黨派人士，繼各黨派參加立法院，監察院之後，今日成立之多黨過渡政府，今後將依憲法之精神行使職權，完成憲法實施之準備，以迄依憲法產生政府之成立。</p>

<p>（此項人選之任免令，均經國府於廿三日公布。按：該名單見另表。</p>
<p>十一時十分會畢，全體委員相繼離國府。是時各報記者已佇候於地塲外，邵力子，陳啓天，曾琦等在前，均着長袍馬褂，邵力子滿面笑容。記者曾分別訪問各府委。陳布雷記者：「國府委會之成立，乃是一種劃時代之事，希望大家一心一德，使局面一新」！孫科述說：「很好」</p>
<h3>張羣對記者稱　願爲民主奮鬥</h3>
<p>張羣稱：「余已有廣播，現在不再說甚麽。」旋復爲記者追問，乃稱：「余將爲和平，建設，統一，民主而奮鬥。」王雲五笑答：「余剛學會一件事，現將再開始學另一件事。」（按王乃指剛長經部，現又調爲副院長也。）主席於十一時半乘車逕返官邸，各新府委亦魚慣而去。</p>

<h3>就任行政院後　張羣首次廣播　闡明對內外大政方針</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕行政院張院長廿三日下午七時，在中央廣播電台對全國同胞發表就職後首次廣播演講，原詞如次：</p>
<p>中華民國憲法已經公布了將近四個月，中國國民黨業已開始結束訓政，擴大政府基礎，並且根據憲法的精神，提前試行行政院責任制。在未來八個月之中，是訓政到憲政的過渡階段，政府一方面要完成州憲政準備的工作，同時更急於要恢復國家的統一和安定，並解決目前嚴重的財政經濟問題，任務萬分艱鉅，而牠的成敗得失，又關係國家百年治亂安危，本人在這個時期受任行政院長，自己審度才力，眞是不勝其戒愼恐懼，所幸國父孫先生，早已手訂了建國大綱，爲我們立國的最高指導原則。關於現階段的政治經濟重要措施，最近國民黨三中全會的決議也非常周詳，至政府改組以後的施政方針，又先後與各黨派和社會賢達獲得了協議，本人唯有在主席領導之下，遵從公意，担負起這個沉重的責任。在這個嚴重的關頭上，一切艱難阻碍，可以預想而知，但本人不敢辭勞怨，也不計個人的成敗利害，當集中心力，鞠躬盡瘁，爲統一民主和平建設而奮鬥，一切犧牲，在所不避，今天就職之期，敬向我全國同胞陳述幾點施政車點，並呼籲全國的團結</p>

<p>新聞局局長　董顯光　（國民黨）</p>
<p>軍事恢復秩序　政府實非得已</p>
<p>今天中國第一個州需要，是安定與統一，這是一切建設的前提，政府自從抗戰結束以後，便一貫以最高的熱忱與忍耐，尋求中共問題的政治解決，本人在過去一年多當中，也曾一再秉承主席的指示，參加和平統一的商談，不幸局勢演變到今天，中共竟以全面的軍事行動，關閉了和平談判的門，使過去一切努力付之流水，爲了恢復秧序，保障統一，政府不得已而採取有效的軍事措施，這是當前國家的需要，人民的要求，政府不得不担起這個責任，但內心實在深感隱痛，希望這個　切有效的措施，結果能夠迅速達成用政治方法根本解決國內糾紛，恢復統一的目的，至於政府一貫追求和平的決心，自不因此而有所改變。</p>
<p>財經危機深刻　決定標本兼治</p>
<p>中國經過了八年的苦戰，國家元氣凋喪，人民生活困苦，再加上戰後一年有餘的國內動亂，國家財政與社會經濟危機，一天一天的深刻化。在治標方面·政府早已頒布經濟緊急措施方案，自當繼續切實執行，在治本方面，政府也要逐步實施旣定方案，現在我必須在這裘强調指出，目前國計民生旣然是這樣的緊迫，我們不能再犯錯誤，政府今後的措施，必須特別審愼，着重於根本之圖，少作枝節之計，凡是無關於預算平衡幣制整理，無關於國計民生的迫切重要事項，絕對不輕率行動，總期從安定中求進步，更當竭力扶植民營經濟事業，使社會游資得以韓用於生產，而政府立誠立信，尤其是一切進步與改革的基礎。</p>
<p>申法紀肅貪污　保障人民自由</p>
<p>關於政治和改革，政府當切實負起振衰救敝的責任，嚴申法紀，肅淸貪汚，屛絕虛浮，延宕惡習，來提高行政效率，尤其希望各級主管把握目標，以當作則，嚴以律已，公以處事，賞不循私，罰不避親，共同樹立崇法務實的政治風氣。至於人民自由權利的保障，這是準備行憲最重要的工作，政府當遵照憲法和改組後的施政方針，對於所有人民應享的自由，依法予以保障更希望全國同胞，認識法律的尊嚴，提高守決的精神，加強對於國家的責任感，使法治與自由相輔相成，納入憲政的常軌。</p>
<p>對外和平相處　力謀增進邦交</p>
<p>在對外關係上，中國所殷切想望的，是一個和平正義友善合作的世界，中國的傳統精神是這樣，事實需要也是這樣，因此，中國政府決心本着一貫的立塲，與世界各友邦和平相處，對於美，蘇，英，法各友邦，更要繼續過去並肩作戰的友誼，力謀增護彼此間的邦交，凡足以妨碍邦交的未決問題，都願意遵循外交當軌，尋求合理的解決。並且要努力促進盟國相互間的融洽關係，確保世界的和平，對於戰後國際各項懸案的處理，以及世界和平秩序與合作關係的建立，中國決不諉卸本身的責任，同時也不放棄自己的國際地位，我們維護聯合國憲章，忠實履行條約義務，尊重友邦的合法權益，而對於自己國家獨立主權與國際地位的保持，也具有最堅定的決心。</p>
<p>發揮潛在力量　努力復興事業</p>
<p>今天國家的困難，已輕到了最嚴重的關頭，應興應革的事，又是如此的經緯萬端，但中國有雄厚的潛在力量，人民也同目政治的熱誠，我們固然絲毫不輕視目前的艱難阻碍，但我們倘如能集中全民的心力，來發揮國家的潛在力量，我們對於中國復興的前途，絕對沒有悲觀懷疑的理由。政府自當於千頭萬緒之中，擇定重點，集中力量，存實心，作實事，期於國事有所補益，全國同胞，也必須要屛除惰性，恪守法令，熟烈勇敢，與政府共同努力於復興的事業，倘如政府的法令或者沒有得到忠實的執行，人民的痛苦與要求，或者爲政府耳目心思所不及，更望能以集思廣益的效能，彌補政府的缺點，如有積極有效而且體的主張，政府必樂於採納。本人服務軍政三十多年，自愧建樹無多，第有一點可以自信的，就是生平不敢違法徇私，也從不計較個人的利害得失，現在艱難受命，本着委身國家休戚相共的大義，當竭盡忠誠，力謀統一的恢復，行憲準備的完成，經濟難關的突破，人民生活的改善，期望不辜負全國同胞，本黨同志對於本人的同情和期許。（完）</p>

<p>爲國會所阻未能運華</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七二日電〕美代理國務卿艾克遜今日在記者招待會中稱：中美所商定撥付中國價値一百四十萬美元之租借物資，因美國國會通過法案，自去歲十一一月一日起禁止國務院將價値二千五百萬元之物資運往十一國家而致迄未能交付中國。按中國自對日勝利日後，已與美國簽訂五千萬元民用租借物資之合約，其中除上述之一百四十萬元物資外，其餘物資已悉數運赴國國。蘇聯與美國訂立下億直千下百萬元租借物資之合約，此諸物資或在候運，或在製造中。美國會刻以不允財部處理與撥付與此項物資有關之一切必要計劃（即令所有款項由接受物資之國家擔負）之方法而停撥價値一千六百七十萬元之物資。按國會目的，主要爲對蘇，但中·法·奧·及其他與美國簽定租借物資合約之各國之租借物資，亦因此而受阻滯，馬歇爾國務卿請國會遵守美國與他國所訂定合約之建議，國會亦置罔開。</p>

<h3>就參加國府事　青年黨發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕靑年黨曾琦等頃代表中國靑年黨就參加國民政府事發表聲明如次：「本　此次參加政府，遠則墓於政協決議，近則藝於國，靑，民，三黨共同協定之十二條施政方針。緬惟以廿四年來，一曾在野之政黨，一旦毅然於國事艱難之際，出而分擔責任，出處之道，必有以與天下共見者，謹貢二義，以諗國人：（一）中國今日雖在强敵旣摧，抗戰勝利之後，而國是之紛紜，民生之凋敝，初不下於往昔，挽救之道，千頭萬緒，而要以安定國本爲第一；中國人民不願再見外力之侵襲，亦不願再見國家之分裂，對於合法之國民，政府但期其在自由進步之原則下，逐漸實現民主；在野政黨之參加政府，可以使國民政府內而獲得和平之改革。外則換得國際之尊重，使中國今後不再陷於分崩離亂之局，國是定而後民心安，民心安而後一切野心者將無伺隙以顚覆國本之機會，此爲安定國家起見，本黨所以不能不出而與一切愛國政黨共同擔負國策者一也。</p>
<p>民國締造三十六年，而民主政治尙未實現，民主政治之推進，端賴有若干民主政黨以政策相切磋，而不以千戈相角逐，爭於議席而不爭於疆塲；今日國內政黨雖多，而求其能深識此義，遵循黨，政之常軌，以和平方式作公開競爭者，實寥寥無幾。本黨　導民主，遠在二十餘年前，夙昔常以民主正統自任，今日中國所需要者，在和平之反對黨，政策可行則出而在朝，政策不行則退而在野；本黨不敏，竊願以此義自循，亦希望國內一切黨派俱循此軌以民主之方法爭取民主，而不以民主以外之方法爭取民主。今日國家正在訓政結束，憲政開始之過渡階段，以民主憲政爲鵠的之政黨，又豈能袖手傍觀，自卸其職此爲　進民主起見，本黨所以不能不出而與一切愛國黨派共同擔負國策者二也。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者國事之刷新，民主之推進，不僅緊於中樞之改革，而尤繫於從下門上之基礎的全面的推動，民主的智識茍不普及於民衆，民主的力量茍不深入於基層，則憲政　礎尙未能謂爲完成，即國家之長治久安，亦未能謂爲遂可以無慮，此則本黨所願與全國各黨派及社會賢達所共同努力者也。</p>
<p>陳啓天常乃惠談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十三日電〕靑年黨新任府委陳啓天，廿三日下午五時接見本報訓者。記者首詢以國府自今日始，應爲多黨政治，然亦有稱爲多黨訓政者，不知陳先生之意見如何？陳氏答稱：本人對多黨訓政，不以爲然，本人以爲民主乃是逐漸發展逐漸進一步者，目前尙係初步，吾人經過二十年來之訓練，始有今日，吾　三五年後，定可走向多黨政治，達到民主境地。記者復詢以靑年黨尙有一政務委員人選未提出，及參加地方政府之名單何時可以提出？陳氏稱：目前正待本黨中常委蒞京召開中常會後，即可決定，本月底前可完成。又新任行政院政委靑年黨常乃應語記渚，靑年黨之政委及部長之就職問題，尙待李璜抵京後始能決定，此次提出名單，所以遲至廿三日晨者，乃以廣徵意見之故。關於參加地方政府間題靑年黨決局部參加，自沿江各省起，臨時機構如省市縣臨參會等，仍主以黨派名額參加。又靑年黨頃已決定正式開始公開各地黨務活勁。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>對新政府的期望</h3>
<p>改組後之國府委員會，已於昨日成立，在國府大禮堂舉行隆重典禮，蔣主席曁孫副主席均親臨致詞；國民黨與民靑兩黨領袖曁社會賢達，聚首一堂，共商當前的實際政務，自國民政府成立二十年來，此爲第一次。同時新任行政院長張羣亦於昨日宣誓就職，政院各部會人選，均已經國府委員會通過，從今日起，一律到部會視事，首都政界頓時充滿了一片光明祥和的新氣象，不僅是喁喁望治的全國人民，對於改組後的新政府，抱着無限的希望；就是全世界愛好和平民主的人士，也莫不盼望中國政府經此次改組後，眞能倡導新的政風，在此短短的過渡期間，完成實施憲政所必需的一切準備工作，爲中國民主建國開闢一條康莊大道。所以改組後的新政府，實在負有非常重大的責任，不僅是中國的治亂，要看改組後的政府能吾完成其任務；而且整個國家的興衰與榮辱，也要視改組後的新政府能吾與民更始而定了。</p>
<p>緣在目前實爲我國歷史上最黯淡的時期；在抗戰期間，雖因軍事的挫折而使我們沮喪；但是展望目前的遠景，終覺得大可樂觀。時至此際，勝利之果業已腐爛殆盡，四强五强之夢，也已覺醒；放眼看看現實，烽火彌漫半個中國，在戰亂地區的人民，固然直接遭受內亂的洗刧；就是在戰亂地區以外的人民，也生活於水深火熱之中，時時遭遇物價飛漲的威脅，處處是生產萎縮及交通阻寨的險象；使人人都威覺到國是的日非，因而陷於苦悶與絕望的境地。在去年國民大會召開之前，我們終是希望國共能重開和談，早日使國內化干戈爲玉帛：後來獲悉了國共之間的癥結，乃知中共如果執迷不悟，不肯放下武器，則一切和談，均無意義可言：因此唯有希望政府多多發揮「盡共在我」的精神，取得中共以外的其他政黨以及社會賢達的合作與諒解，按步就班，向着民主建國的大道邁進。去年國民大會制定憲法的時侯，全國人民莫不寄以無限的希望，其故亦卽在此。憲法旣已公佈，民主的規模粗定，只要依照行憲的程序，作充分的準備，自能走上憲政的正軌。因此國人的注意，又集中在過渡時期的準備行憲的工作；國民黨實行訓政達廿年之久，未能完成行憲的工作，雖由於內亂外患的相繼而來，但亦不能不負相當的責任。而且過渡時期，爲期甚爲短促，稍縱卽逝，不能不特別加以珍惜；在國民黨本身，旣歡迎其他政黨的領袖參加政府，共同負起準備實施憲政的責任；此在全國人民更盼望政府能擴大民主的基礎，由各黨派參加，協力同心，切實完成一切準備行憲的工作。所以自從國民大會閉幕以來，全國人民就期待着政府的改組。事到如今，政府改組終算全部實現了。但是改組後的新政府，究底應該做些什麽工作？又怎樣才算不負國人的期望？吾人願乘改組後的政府成立之際，一述我們老百姓內心所欲說的話</p>
<p>第一是國內的安定，老百姓對於政府的要求，非當單純，一言以蔽之，就是國內的安定。但是在目下的環境之下，要做到國內的安定，確是一件非常不容易的工作。這個安定的要求，包括着政治的安定與經濟的安定。以前者而論共產黨問題，如果不能獲得解決，戰亂就沒有停止的希望，欲求得國內的安定，也就根本不可能了，中共問題怎樣才能獲得解決？改組後之政府的施政方針，也規定採取政治方式解決，並謂一俟鐵路交通恢復，卽與中共進行談判。我們認爲這是我國政治唯一的出路。改組後之新政府，能吾完成這個施政方針，實爲其成敗的一大關鍵。關於後者經濟的安定，可謂全國人民一致的要求了；有人說政治不安定，就是採取任何良策美計，都是不中用的，這種說法，固然也有相當的理由，但是把一切問題都推在政治問題身上，而要求總解決，也不是一個辦法。試問中共問題不解決，難道經濟問題永遠就不能解決了嗎？我們相信人力勝天，只要政府敢作敢爲，設法收縮通貨，平衡預算，增加生產，發展對外貿易，決不是絕對沒有辦法謀得經濟上的安定的。所以我們老百姓對於改組後的政府，最盼望它能拿出辦法來；謀得經濟上的安定，不能再使我們老百姓在饑餓綫上掙扎了，吾則高唱民主憲政，均無意義可言。</p>
<p>第二是行憲的準備，政府在過渡時期所負的最大任務，當在充分準備行憲的工作，我屈指計算，從今天起到憲政開始之日，爲期僅有八個月，實在太短促了；但是怎樣能在這短短的八個月之中，完成準備行憲的工作呢？立法的程序，固極重要‘，但是終不及民主政風的養成。所謂民主政風，可以分爲兩方面來說，在政府方面，應充分表現出民主政治的新精神，不僅要開明，能幹勇於負責以及講究行政效率，而且還要有虛懷若谷的胸襟，能接受別人的批評，一切行政設施悉以民意爲依歸，不替個人打算，也不專爲政黨着想，而處處咸能以整個國家民族，人民的利益爲前提，事事能顧全大局，甚至能犧牲小我而成就大我。此在入民方面，也應該熱心地虛心地學習民主憲政的運用，一面要有容忍別人意見的大量，另一面也要有守法的精神，人人如果都能有這種容忍守法的基本精神，則行憲一定會有良好的成績，眞正能使中國政治步入和平民主的新時代。所以我們老百姓除希望政府有此新作風而外，並應以此自動。</p>
<p>要之，自今天起，改組後的新政府開始工作了，這是我國政治革新及民主化的起點，全國人民莫不懷有無限希望，但願中國政治從今日新生，替中國民主建國，開闢一條新的途徑來。</p>

<h3>美援助希土两国方案　参院已正式通过　一俟衆院核准即能生效</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿下日電〕杜魯門總統之四亿美元援助希土防共一项法案，雖反對者斥諸爲「對蘇聯宣戰」，但今日已經參議院以六十七票對廿五票，加以通過，现惟待衆院作最後之通過。衆院茲定於下週開始辯論。問衆院領袖擬限制辯論之日期，俾於下週內即可送交杜魯門總統簽署。據杜魯門之警吿稱：英國已不能再負担對希臘之軍事與經濟援助，已在將期軍隊自東地中海國家撤退，美國倘不予以援助，則戰略地點之韃　尼爾海峽·土耳共及中東油田富廠，均將淪於共　勢力控制之下。據稱，美國此項措施將授權總統以美國軍器·金錢及軍事顧及重事顧問，援助希土二國政府，但並不派軍隊前往。此舉殆爲通知世人美國因聯合國不擬處理此緊要問題，故單獨應付希土二國之危機，但其序文則申言此項計劃之目的乃舉聯合國締造和平之任務相同。此項援助措施附有修正案一條，規定聯合國安全理事會或聯國國大會（不能一票否決）可以多數票，在任何時間加以停止，但亦規定聯合國將接辦美國此項任務。該案將以軍事與經濟援助希土二國，其分配辦法爲三億元貸予希臘，一德元貸予土耳其，至何者將作爲須予付還乙借款，則由杜魯門總統予以決定，屆時美國將有限定人數之軍事人員前往希土二國，但並無軍隊前往，經濟代表團亦將派往二國，監督其分配美國救濟品及指導希土二國政府之經濟政策。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕范登堡本日在衆議院投票表決之前發表演說，要求民主共和黨議員，均應面臨此一問題，即共產黨已自波羅的海侵入中國南海是也，殆無人能予以吾認。杜魯門總統之援助希土計劃，僅表示總統之政策而巳，有謂此舉實爲美國干涉巴爾幹，又謂此舉不啻對蘇聯宣戰，凡此各節，均非事實，吾人應支持總統所採取之政策。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國前任商務部長華萊士在美國及歐洲各國所採取反對杜魯門政策之「十字軍運動」，對於美國參議院表決援助土希兩國計劃，已發生若干影響，至少已使頗有勢力之參議員二人，投票反對此項計劃，此即佛羅里達州民主黨參議員裴柏及愛達荷州民主黨參議員泰勒是也。據觀察家本日談稱：裴柏及泰勒所屬之少數而極活動之理想主義派，預料在衆議院中將更爲衆多，此一少數派之行動，不問其如何荏任弱，但在政府要求繼續撥款時，殆將增强共和黨對於民主黨政府之反對。頃悉：杜魯門總統及其顧問，均認爲美國所當男予希土兩國之援助，僅在開始階段，杜魯門主義更廣泛與更普遍之性質，尙待分曉。據美國外交界可靠方面稱：白宮舉行秘密會議，在馬歇爾國務卿自莫斯科返國之前，不致採取確切之決定。馬歇爾國務卿將確定蘇聯之意向，然後決定美蘇關係之重要問題，能吾在最近將來獲得解決。至援助土希兩國之法案，在五月杪或六月初成爲法律時，美國政府殆將決定對國會採取戰略，以擴大杜魯門主義之範圍云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社社華盛頓廿二日電〕頃悉：美國駐土耳其大使韋爾森將於廿五日晚間偕同國務院近東事務司長李白勒登前往土耳其，談判美國以一億美元軍用剩餘物資接濟土國，助其改編軍隊事宜。</p>
<h3>發政府邀請　希外長訪發　兩國關係更趨密切</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿二日電〕官方頃宣佈：土耳其駐希公使烏納庭業已邀請希臘外長蔡爾達理斯前往安哥拉聘問。另一方面，希臘海軍部長維尼齊洛斯則已邀請土國艦隊訪問希臘各港口。此外希土雨國即將舉行談判，旨在確定一項共同之農業政策，俾對於葡萄，無花果及烟草之生產，避免競爭，並减低其價格。又據希臘陸軍參謀總部今晨宣佈帖撤利中部廣達四千平方公里之地區，巳完全爲政府軍所控制，該區游擊隊或則被俘，或則逃逸，計游擊陣亡三百四十六名，被俘者二百九十四名，有大批游擊隊已自動投誠。此在希臘陸軍及憲兵陣亡則三十名，受傷者七十四名。希臘陸軍將乘勝追擊，不予游擊以恢復其力量之機會。</p>
<h3>希總理感激美國</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿三日電〕希總理麥克西莫斯今日吿國會稱：爲表示値得接受美國之援助起見，必須做到下列兩事：（一）儘速撲滅叛亂；（二）消滅來自任何其他方面之反民主勢力。美國之援希，表示吾人對國家以及杜魯門總統所擁護之民主主義，負担更大之責任，相信國會必能通過大規模之節儉計劃，使美國人民慷慨樂助之每一元，均能用於適合借款原意之用途。</p>
<h3>停止蘇貨運事　艾克遜闡明立塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿三日廣播：自參議員范登堡建議在蘇聯未曾淸算一百十億元租借案帳目以前停止對蘇貨運以後，各方對國務院之態度頗爲注意。副國務卿艾克遜頃在記者招待會中特爲此事發表談話稱：國務院之立塲始終未曾變更，即美國允許運往蘇聯之一千七百萬元戰後租借物資，仍應照原定計劃運出云。</p>
<p>三月十二日杜魯門總統宣佈援助希土方案後，參衆兩院均寄予極大注意，圖示代理國務卿艾克遜在參院外交委員會答覆議員質詢時之情。（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>

<h3>華萊士在法廣播　主張美貸款蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕前美國副總統華萊士今日抵此後，在法國電台廣播，主張由美國經由聯合國機構之某種機構，對蘇聯作非政治性之貸款。華氏云，爲保障持久和平起見，必須中聯合國機構之某一機構，照顧蘇聯廣大之災區，此等災區不僅爲戰爭所造成之災區，並有因一再發生旱災而造成者。蘇聯田於貧瘠，乃不得不向德國要求鉅額工業生產物之賠償，此舉將增加德國之痛苦，卒至造成歐洲之不安定。職是之故，余主張由美國給予蘇聯以非政治性之貸款，使蘇聯得以恢復其工業生產，余希望美國能經由聯合國機構運用其偉大之力量。</p>

<h3>陸家浜崑山間　金陵號特快車出軌傾覆　受傷十一人送蘇錫醫治　午夜修復路軌交通受阻九小時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩路局京滬綫，昨日下午一時三十分由滬駛京之第二次金陵號頭二等聯運特快車，於二時三十六分，在陸家浜與崑山間西巷小站之西楊旗外，最後兩節客車（ＦＰ五〇三號及ＳＰ七〇五號）忽然出軌，傾覆於該路南面。所幸司機發覺後立即刹車，其他車輛未遭殃及，傾覆客車乘客一人陳盤銘受重侮，九人受輕傷，另一車僮陶增榮亦受甫傷。當由西巷站人員施救，並急電吿上海兩路局，由該局副局長侯或華，　務處長關鐸，工務處長梅福强等率同各項工程人員及醫護人員，搭乘教援車馳往出事地點救護搶修。</p>
<p>該金陵號特快車前部朱出軌之車輛，於下午三時五十七分繼續前駛，所有受傷乘客隨車送往蘇州醫院就治，未受傷之二百餘乘客，均隨原車赴京。記者於事後搭乘該局救援車前往出事地點察視，路工正在加緊更換枕太及鋼執，傾覆之兩節客車，車窗全毁，沙發設備零亂不堪，惟乘客所用之玻一茶杯，多完好無損。該客車距離路軌僅尺許。下午八時半，以起重　將傾覆車箱吊起，並將路執修復、至晚十一時半，各班車須始恢復行駛，計昨晚京滬綫交通受阻先後共九小時之久。事後檢點，損壞鋼軌三十八根，枕不震斷三進餘根。路基損壞共長三百餘公民。出事原因，該局負責人正根據各方面報告，作詳細查及研究，並定今日下午召開行事事變會議，未作定論前，不願有所表示。南京交通部長俞大維聞訊後，至爲關切，立即電命該局局長陳伯莊前往醫院慰問受傷乘客陳氏公忙，乃請副局長侯或華代表於昨晚赴蘇錫醫院慰問。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕覆車重傷者共四人，三爲乘客，一名陳盤銘，頭　破裂一窟窿，一名張炳福，傷脊骨胸部甚重，已不能行走或起坐，今在無錫普仁醫院診治，據聞張係錫南洋飯店主人，另一人被摔傷胸肩等部頗危殆。又一爲車僮陶增榮，鼻樑撞斷，成一丁字形裂痕，骨斷裂爲三。</p>
<p>據金陵號出事車上人談：此次出軌，受傷人數不多，實因天寒車廂門窗緊閉之故，否則乘客自門窗中摔出，斷無倖免之理。又謂ＦＰ五〇三號頭等車爲美國新運到之車，或因車輪與　軌間比例未能　符標準，因而出軌傾覆。車上璃窗極寬闊而厚，每塊價格在四百萬元以上，幾多破碎。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕金陸號快車自滬駛抵距崑山站四五公里之西巷時，最末客車兩節忽然傾覆，機車因距離頗遙，致未能及時發覺，仍繼續前駛一公里許始停。旅客重傷二名，輕傷四名業已分送崑蘇兩地醫治。此次覆車原因，乃因美式車輪與現有路軌不能十分適合，致速率稍高，即有震零傾覆危險。</p>

<h3>工界要求調整指數　切實取締奸商操縱水祥雲談過去物價這漲無關指數</h3>
<p>自政府實施經潛緊急方案，凍結工人生活指數後，物價雖然平定一時，然至近日，又見波動上漲，本市勞工以影響生計，頗爲焦慮，各工會漸有要求調整指數者。大公社記者，昨特趨訪市總工會理事長水祥雲，詢其此事之感想。　據談，當局公布工人生活指數，以一月份工資爲標準，余即表示物價亦須貴責於一月份起凍結，並要求配給實物，數量與公敎人員相等。旋經吳市長吳局長向中央力爭，方得六項實物差額金。較原定辦法稍優，但與原有生活指數種類比較，尙少四十八種。本市工界參議員，曾在大會提出要求，解凍生活指數，而市總工會亦有三個月調整生活指數之議，但常局以經濟緊急方案公布未久，物價尙欠穩定，爲維護中央法令，暫　變更，而工人亦體念國家經濟危機，暫時忍痛接受。迄今三月，物價未見稍减，且反上漲，米油布菜蔬等日用必需品，飛騰更甚，工人於此種情形下，實難維持眞生計，當時政府猶以爲物價之漲，由於指數，實則指數原山物價產生，先有物價，始有指數，指數決不致引導物價上漲，觀於此次指數凍結之後，物價仍扶搖直上，即爲明證，而勞苦之工人，反於此時遭受重大之犧牲，是以總工會於此種情形下，惟有要求政府二點：（一）請政府調整指數，（二）請政府切實取締奸商之投機壟斷，俾使物價回平，以安定工人生活，否則產業界之勞資糾紛，勢將起伏不已，影響整個社會之安寗云·</p>
<h3>海塘工和舞弊　查明事出誤會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工務局爲澈查海塘工程舞弊案，根據高橋第三保區民代表之吿發，稱海塘工程隊包工楊義郞，移用原有塘石，作爲價買新石料事，待派高級職員三人，於本月和日前往查勘，並邀該區區長鍾玉良，民衆代表大會主席崔志明，黄孟琰同査，崔黄二人因事外出，未及參加。當由工務局高級職員三人會同工程隊隊長許卷崧，包工楊義郞，共往兩地査勘。調査結果，昨經工務局發表如下：（一）工程地段係第三工程隊，非屬第四工程隊所管轄。（二）鍾區長崔志明呈稱，搬塘石數千萬噸實非事實。僅搬運六百餘方，約合九百四十餘噸。（三）根據合約上載明，撈取遠散石工，每立方公尺三千元，裝卸卡車工每立方公尺二千元，舖砌工每立方公尺六千元，合計每立方公尺一萬一千元，石料並不作價，運輸卡車係工程隊管理組撥用，不另列運費。（四）撈石地段，呈査相符，因該段排樁外有淺砂灘，容易撈取，拆塘一節，則絕無此事。</p>
<p>又本月二十一日，工務局乙一職員曾再度往高橋，會晤崔黄二人，據彼等談稱：前因開會事忙，未能同往，至於工程隊搬石事，因事前未見報吿，且當地民衆，不願將甲地之石遷往乙地。綜上各點，可知或由於當地居民僅見卡車搬運石塊，即疑有弊端，致造成誤會云；</p>

<h3>教部本年度仍擬舉辦　公費留學生考試　額定三百名已呈政院核款</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕敎育部鑒於我國各項人材，均極缺乏，除充實國內大學及研究機關，以資培養外，派遣留學生出國，吸取新知，尤屬重要。在抗戰前，敎部對留學敎育，即非常注重。抗戰期間，因經費及交通關係，留學考試，除英美硏究實習生考試及第一次自費留學考試外，教部即未曾舉辦公費考試。勝利以後，百廢待舉，各項建設，均需專門人材參加，乃於去年七月舉辦公自費留學生考試各一次。公費考試，原擬錄取一千名，嗣因經費有限，改爲一百名，與實際需要相去遠甚。今後培育人材，仍不容緩，故敎部在三十六年度工作計劃中，仍列有派遣留學生一項。記者頃從有關方面探悉：敎部本年度仍擬舉辦公費留學生考試，名額原定爲五百名，後以經濟措施方案公佈，外匯困難，已改定爲三百名，現已呈請行政院梭示，一經批准，即可籌備進行。</p>

<h3>田徑規則可能的修改</h3>
<p>— 吳邦偉</p>
<p>現在國內所用田徑賽規則，還是一九三六年的，最近是否能從世運會方面得到新規則，不得而知，但國際業餘運動會於一九四〇年準備在芬蘭舉行十二屆世運時，曾於一九三九年在法國開會修訂規則，修改的地方並不多，我想本屆全國運動會至少應採用這比賽新的規則，故先將變更各點，非正式的介紹。</p>
<p>（一）發令的口號原文已改爲＂On　Your　Marls＂"Set"用國語時「預備」二字或將改爲一個字。</p>
<p>（二）呼"Set"後，發令員認爲各運動員確已鎮定一致，即可放槍，與舊規則「略停約二秒鐘然後放槍」稍有不同。</p>
<p>（三）呼。"Set"以後至放槍以前，運動員的手或足離位者作犯規論。</p>
<p>（四）起跑時得用起跑板，此意並非欲予運動員以器物的帮助，而是要保護跑道且使比賽進行加速</p>
<p>（五）分道比賽的起跑，各運動員不在同一起跑綫上者，（如二百或四百公尺轉灣者），發令員應立在適當的地點，使與每一遝動間的距離，大致相等。</p>
<p>（六）用刺激激品增加比賽時的體能者，將永久取消其參加比賽的資格。</p>
<p>（七）跳高或撑竿跳高成績相等時，決定名次的方法，如爲解決第一各的，應在共同失敗的高度上作第四次試跳，如均能跳過，則加高二公分，各跳一次；如第四次試跳均失敗，則降低至最後跳過的高度上各跳一次；如仍無結果，應繼續增高或降低至判分爲止。</p>
<p>（八）田賽之以距離計算者，如成績相等，以各相等運動員的次佳成績判分其名次。（如此項規則實行，則每一運動員每次跳擲的成績均須準確丈量並紀錄，以備査考。）</p>
<p>（九）跳高撑竿跳高時，裁判員應於比賽開始前向運動員宣吿其以後每次增加之高度。</p>
<p>（十）撑竿跳高時遝動員所持的竹竿，觸及插竿凹穴的頂板的豎平面者，作失敗論。</p>
<p>（十）（一）欄架規定用新式，故踢倒欄架，無取消資格的規定，其成績並可作正式紀錄。</p>

<h3>市府奉政院三項指示　加強管制紗布供應　進行辦法須俟吳兼主委返滬決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府昨接獲行政院訓令，對於紗布供應均衡，及平抑價格，決定三項辦法：（一）棉紗布疋報關轉口或交鐵路轉運者，須經紡織事業管理委員會核給許可證。（二）紡織事業管理委員會核給許可證，應按照紗布輸往華南暫行管理辦法，及甲乙審核簡則之規定辦理。（三）東北廣東需用紗布，應由經濟部轉飭中紡公司尅日趕運，充分供應。上列一二兩項，均自即日起施行。已分令財政經濟交通三部遵照。市政府奉令後，昨（廿三日）已通知經濟部紡織事業管理委員會遵照辦理。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紡管會業務處劉處長語記者：行政院頒訂平抑紗布價格辦法三項，昨日上海市府已接急電，並轉送到會。照該項辦法內容而言，棉紗布疋報關轉口，均須憑本會核給許可證，可知牽涉範圍殊廣。且如按照管制紗布南運辦法辦理，則每月運往全國各主要商埠之紗布，均需計算限額，手續殊屬繁瑣，要非一蹴可就。惟本會刻正積極準備中，一俟吳兼主委返滬，即當洽商進行辦法。</p>
<p>紗布市況一致下游</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日行政院頒訂平抑紗布價格三項辦法後，本市江海關及北站等，已由財政交通兩部轉到訓令，出口頓受限制，故紗布市况，一致下游。執貨者紛求脫手，買戶則不敢續進，上午行市挫跌尤鉅，惟下午人心已趨穩定。</p>
<p>四月棉紗收價預測</p>
<p>又據劉氏吿稱：四月份棉紗之收購價，以六區棉紡公會議價小組會，遲遲未曾議出，故紡管會亦無從根據討論，並未有已確定三百四十萬元之說。現行總在滬之棉花，業已核配竣事。據渠推算，如以行總棉花每担六十五萬元計算成本，則四月份廿支紗之收購價，當在四百萬元以上。至各廠在行總及限額進口兩種棉花以外，自行購花所紡之紗，則並不在收購之列。</p>
<p>棉紡公會致紡管函</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區機器棉紡織工業同業公會，近以棉花價格騰漲，對紡管會所定之收購價，已感無法維持成本，特臚列詳細數字，函陳紡管會，請對紡織業作全面之指示，俾資遵循，茲探誌原函內容如次：</p>
<p>「謹啓者：自上年十二月廿七日貴會第十八次委員會議議決穩定紗價辦法，各紗廠自卅六年一月一日起，所製之棉紗，由政府收購其半數等云，實施以來，各紗廠無不恪遵辦理。無如自貴會徵購棉紗穩定市價後，爲時未久，棉紗市價，已自每件二百二十萬元漲至六百數十萬元，棉價已自每担三十萬元漲至一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>一月份收購紗價，每件一百九十七萬五千元，距離市價不過二十萬元。今四月份收購紗價，雖尙未奉貴會明示，然已有在三百四十萬元左右擬定之說，距離市價至三百餘萬元。以比例論，始則差額僅及百分之十，今則已至百分之百。至棉價與紗價，更逐見脫節。</p>
<p>在收購之初，棉價每担三十萬元，與棉紗收購價一百九十七萬五千元爲一與六·六之比，今棉價已至一百五十萬元。姑擬之收購價格，仍在三百四十萬元左右，爲一與二·三之比，其比例相差三分之二。就收購之目的言，原爲穩定紗價。而紗價之不穩定如故，早失收購之意義。</p>
<p>市價與收購價距離日遠，市面之演樊亦遠非始料所及。尤以紗花市價，不能配合。（如以三百四十萬爲收購價格，按市價購買棉花，僅得二百三十斤。照每件需用原棉三百五十斤，尙虧短一百二十斤，工繳更無着落。）倘不澈底改弦更張，則紗價未收穩定之效，紗廠已有停工輟業之勢。貴會負督導全國紡織業合理進展之使命，目前紡織業已面臨存亡絕續之境，切吩貴會有全面之指示，俾資遵循，紡織工業幸甚，民族工業幸甚」。</p>
<p>四十六戶恢復配紗</p>
<p>因申請配紗，數額不符生產實際需要，致被紡建公司暫停配售之廠商一八三戶，曾再度向該公司業務處申述理由，並補繳證件，現經覆騐合格，准自昨（廿三）日起，恢復配售者，計有四十六戶。內針織業二三戶，內衣業六戶，毛巾被單業五戶，手帕業十戶，帆布業二戶云。</p>
<p>不法經營查獲四起</p>
<p>警備部經濟組，連日派出大批人員，赴各紗布市塲偵査奸商，並予强壓，業已收獲效果。昨日雙馬廿支紗黑市每件自六百八十萬元之高價，狂瀉一百餘萬元，布每疋亦下跌三萬元至四萬元，並有續跌趨勢。又該組昨日發表査獲非法經營紗布案四件如下：（一）北京路二百八十號鹽業大樓富安紗廠，自四月七日起至四月十五日止，以黑市售出棉紗一百八十八包，均超越議價，顯屬不法。該廠經理倪葆生，副經理杜孕展，已予傳訊，該案昨移送地檢處訊辦。（二）中正東路中匯大樓二四九號生新紗號僞造帳册，囤積棉紗廿九件，所圃棉紗罰處充公。（三）中匯大樓二五〇號勤興紗號，爲一「歇壁」紗號專做「踢皮球」生意，帳册全無，罰處停業。（四）小沙渡路永大協記號，係一百貨商店，假借百貨名義，請配布疋，以黑市賣出，經檢査人員當塲査獲，亦已移送地檢處法辦。</p>
<h3>統債平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨仍極平庸，先高後低，五〇四室有出，潤德則納。統丙晨開一四〇〇〇元，高價一四〇〇〇元，低至一二六〇〇元，最後在一三〇〇〇元內外掙扎。結果較前收計回跌一千二，甲乙降一千元，丁種尙平，統戊則挫一千三，成交不過三四百萬。</p>
<h3>美金債劵擔保已經指定四種</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕財部經部及敵僞產業處理局等機關，近曾數度集議，商討美金債券擔保問題，聞已決定，將下列四類，作爲擔保，（一）全國所接收之碼頭及倉庫，（二）全國所接收之房地產，（三）上海拜耳藥廠等公司，中政府所投資之股票，（四）中紡公司，聞上述四類，總値逾五萬億元。監理會覆核時，若認數額不足，當可續撥。現詳細表册，正由經部等機關造具中。又政府近曾令國行將九月卅日到期之美金債券本息撥出，國行正辦理轉賬手續，短期即可公布。</p>
<h3>糖市起伏不一</h3>
<p>糖市仍以塲外交易趨勢起伏不一，提莊靑二十萬〇一千至二千元，棉赤二十一萬八千至二十二萬，興化白高貨三十二萬至三十一萬五千元，興化赤二十一萬至二十萬〇八千元，凈刁靑十八萬七千至九千元，總共成交五百餘件。</p>
<h3>台糖公司客戶重行登記編號</h3>
<p>據台糖公司息，該公司客戶登記業已規定重編辦法如下，（一）凡前已准登記之客戶，其登記號碼自一號至五百號者，自即日起，應向該公司推廣課領取調査表，重行塡寫，限於四月三十日前送該公司審核，重行編號。（二）自五月一日起，開始適用新編登記號碼，所有舊登記號碼，一律取消</p>
<h3>新光遞交今日登塲</h3>
<p>昨日「新光」開盤一〇八元，收市一一五元，後市初開，即由二〇四穆壯武掛一二四元，首吿漲停板。一五四號，雖大量塞出，終因有銀行帮證券帮等力進，多空掙扎，漲達限度至十餘次之多，漲停板後，塲外三十五元有成交。今晨「新光遞交」，初次登塲，照昨日檯面，走勢將更趨活躍云。</p>
<h3>應時呢羢暢銷</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢行市頗秀，呢羢服裝店舖男女色呢羢銷路均暢。應時之淺白顏色薄花呢嗶嘰凡立丁派力司羽紗呢等，客本帮進　更健。因天熱實銷遞加，中西衣着去路增盛。躉批標準市價，因受種種事實及環境關係，依然在明堅暗漲之途。觀乎零剪掛牌，各號莫不續再調整，稍可入目之春夏貨品，每單尺皆標售四萬元以上，西裝每套多標價一百萬元左右</p>
<h3>中韓進出口物資特許者可准運輸</h3>
<p>我國與韓國間，尙未正式宣佈通商，關於進出口貿易問題，韓國已派代表駐滬，與我外交當局協商中，唯迄未獲得具體辦法。茲悉目前兩國進出口貿易物資，凡經政府特許者，可准予運輸，否則如有輪船帆船，擅自載運貨物，由韓國進口，或我國輸往韓國，一律禁止，凡査獲私運，即行扣留云。</p>
<h3>受外股暴漲影響　華股又正跌回漲　漲停板者多至十一種</h3>
<p>華股昨以外股之暴騰，激動大量買氣，跌後急漲，少壯派振臂一呼，午後永紗新光漲停後，均有貼價做開。</p>
<p>晨初　以大鈔刺激，除新光仍維持原盤，火柴微降外，餘股均見開高。遞永紗開後由二二號八〇號一四五號買進，曾升至四一〇〇元。一九七號一〇五號三六號一三四號二二三號二二四號六一號趁高有售，退至三九七〇元。二三一號一九九號一九六號三五號購買，再將遞永紗抬高至四一二〇元。二三五號二八號八五號一四五號四八號一五四號一九七號四七號一六五號一九九號一〇五號一四四號一八三號紛紛賣出，遞美亞遞永公統益現永公遞華豐以及水泥均吿跌停，遞永紗回跌至三七〇〇元，景福等小股有一度無人過問之象。後以一五二號二三五號七六號九五號一八〇號四號二一九號二二四號九七號九九號一五四號五四號一四號八〇號三五號一〇六號一五五號一五三號連袂購買，遞永紗乃逐漸回升至四〇〇〇元外。二三五號一三四號六一號三六號逢高脫手，降落至三八七〇元。一三三號六一號九一號一三四號一四五號一五二號一二一號二一一號一九七號等爭購，外股之漲勢十分俏俐，近午漲風突起，午收時高後稍平。結果較前收計永紗因前日午後無成交，是以軋跌一成弱，信和跌半成弱，新華微降，景福微升，美亞華學永公跌一成光景，中法新光漲半成强，遞交計永紗微升，景福升半成弱，信和平，美亞跌半成弱，華豐永公各跌一成光景，冷設計水泥統益跌停　有回，計前者跌成半弱，統益降半成，內衣升一成，麗安徽升，均因增資之故也。新亞跌停，餘股各跌半成左右。</p>
<p>午後　祇做即交，開後一〇一號二二三三號一五三號一四號一八五號一五二號一三三號九七號　購，即自四ｇ　二〇元扶搖萬上，漲到四四〇〇元。縈福新光首先漲達限度，景福漲停後即回，新光忽來大量金融帮垂靑，二〇四號一七四號三六號一一〇號八四號九七號二一九號等奮購，漲達限度者達十餘次，除漲停外，暗盤有喊高至一三〇元以外者。永紗高價有二二號一〇六號八號六八號脫手，曾回落至四三〇〇元內，但以外股之漲勢驚人，買氣興奮。內衣大通商務九福榮豐等紛吿漲停，一五二號力購不已，三六號九七號一八五號二二四號二一八號均進，二二三號力購更勇，永紗終亦漲停，且有貼價二三十元者。結果較前收計永紗美亞新光景福中法漲停，華豐新華升一成，信和永公升成半弱，場外各股除大生平平外，餘均微升。</p>
<h3>米市無正式成交　糧食粉油再告上漲　塲外白粳高升至十九萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨受萬元大鈔發行及產地報漲影響，再吿上漲。南北兩市塲共到貨五千六百八十六石。市塲食米行情單粳薄稻欄均呈空白，未有塡價。粳米形成無貨應市之象，塲外價格瞎喚，暗中飛騰萬餘元。當局勸吿同業設法平定價格，故粳米市塲竟無正式成交，，白元昇挺至十九萬六千元新高價，陰元亦達十八萬二千元。社會局繼續拋出白粳紅尖及西貢共九千包，價白粳仍爲十三萬五千五，紅尖十二萬零五百元，中號西貢十一萬元。塲外白粳黑市已高昇至十九萬，門市零售限價之十六萬五千，今因產地報漲，已不能供售。</p>
<p>昨據糧食科長吉明齋告稱：數日來社會局於市塲所拋之白粳西貢及紅尖，共達五萬八千三百零五包。其中尙有三萬餘包現正在辦出貨手續。外傳米商付款已五六日，而配米尙未撥給說，實爲不確，付款及辦理出貨手續，約費三日，即可出貨。渠對日來米價之又吿上跳，表示祗能作盡職之消防員，致力於消極之管制。至積極疏通來源，抑平產地價格，則非彼所能做到。渠又稱：吳局長已去京出席全國物價會議，對此當能籌有對策。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕麵粉利　黑市　昨已昇至十萬一千，較前日漲起二千。兵船七萬二千八百，漲起四千八百元。本廠豆油四十九萬狂漲三萬元。靑島吉普桶生油仍爲四十九萬。大迎豆昇至十四萬，浦東杜豆則爲十六萬五千元。菉荳南洋去化仍爽，步砌三四千元。赤豆華南暢納，暴漲萬餘元，生仁廣消續旺再漲萬元。芝蔴油廠去化香燥，猛跳萬元。苞米亦隨之上升二三千元。紅糧酒坊去胃轉暢，猛漲四五千元。配油照常供應。</p>
<h3>各帮爭先買進外股漲勢猛烈</h3>
<p>外股昨以港市匯水大縮，廣帮證券帮銀行帶爭買不已，籌碼涸竭，漲勢空前激烈。怡紗晨開三九四〇〇元，即吿爭員，高價漲達四八七〇〇元。喊價有迫近五萬元者混亂已極。惟高後稍有回落，結果較前收計怡紗漲起二或弱，英聯漲一成半，會德豐業廣紙業電話開平各漲一成光景，航業升半成，怡啤　業墾植微升而已。</p>
<h3>茶市交易寥落</h3>
<p>本年度溫州新龍井，自產區存底趨縮後，邇來到源已不若日前之多，執貨者喊價卒吿上升。毛峯綠茶，刻下屯溪新貨每祖開二百四十萬元，泗安新貨每担爲二百萬元，而此間所開價格異常高昂，因此去化極爲呆滯。至於各種內銷陳茶，供求不多，過程仍若膠着狀態。洋莊茶市買戶胃納猶狹，且續擬低價進取，形勢迄難抬頭，交易賡續寥寥。</p>
<h3>人造絲二千五百箱到滬　中信今日恢復配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宣傳已久之本年度第一批日貨人造絲，昨日終由中央信託局自日本裝到一批，數共二千五百箱。中央信託局已定自今日起，恢復配售。先配絲織業，除絲織聯營公司之配額外，各廠仍按去年十二份之申請數量，先配五分之一云。</p>
<p>昨人造絲市因傳中信局週五起恢復配售，故開盤即吿下挫，一二〇號高山有光一百三十萬元開盤後，退到一千〇九十萬元有成交。嗣後喊價盤旋，無大變化，仍以九十萬元收盤。下午人心更軟，喊價最小六十萬元。一度因股票上漲，喊價曾跳高至一百六七十萬元，終以配售在即，乏人過問，不支下降，最後仍喊一千〇九十萬元。結果比上日小去一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨前市頗形靜寂，B字等級有幾担成交，價做一千四百萬元。下午稍形活動，各檔均略有做開，價比上午大二三十萬元之譜，結果與上日價相仿。</p>
<p>綢貨昨亦疲軟，被面均小十萬至二十萬元，大誠格子璧縐開盤喊二萬三千七百元，不乏乘低補空，旋即升至四千二百元成交，最後喊四千四百元，仍比上日下挫一千元。其餘各貨，廠盤俱無更動。</p>
<h3>吳淞漁汛　黃花魚已上市每担十五萬元</h3>
<p>吳淞每年春季黄花魚汛，爲當地大宗營業，前昨兩日，已有大批漁船，先後進口，共計五十餘艘，由蔣福泰等報關行經辦。海關騐艙後，已起卸上岸銷售，議定開秤，市價每担十五萬元。本年度經售之魚行有源和，協興公，集成，駿大，公大祥等三十餘家，內地客家派員到淞辦貨者，亦頗踴躍。</p>
<h3>五金上升</h3>
<p>五金市况，又見上升。其中洋釘漲風最烈。人頭砂布三星鋼鋸及一切銅鐵製成品，均見好轉。</p>
<h3>第二季進口限額本月內可望公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入管理委員會執委會，於四月廿二日，舉行第二十九次例會。茲經探悉議決各案如次：（一）中央銀行定四月廿三日，召集輸出推廣及輸入管理兩委員會開聯席會議，討論出口貨所需要包裝物料及原料之特殊進口辦法，一經獲有決議，可望於短期內開始實施。（二）非限額進口審核處所主管之附表（三）甲類貨品，其進口申請書經核准後，原由該處連同簽發輸入許可證。茲定由五月一日起，此項轍入許可證，改由輸入品管理處簽發，以資劃一。（三）關於審核附表（二）類貨品之進口商登記原則，該會決議第一季附表（二）類貨品限額之分配，仍照原定審核標準辦理。自第二季起，原定審核標準，可酌予放寬。除以民國卅五年之進口額爲準繩外，擬同時審核戰前各商家之進口額及資望，並考慮新成立之進口商中，持有獨家經理人之資格者。（四）第二季附表（二）類貨品進口之限額，已由張總裁擬具數額，親自携京呈請全國經濟委員會核准，可望於本月內正式公佈。（五）限額分配處及非限額審核處尙未核辦之進口申請書，張總裁極表關切，已於會中囑各主管處長，限期淸理，連日工作極度緊張。聞第一類每日約可處理三四十件，第二類一百餘件，第三類甲項二三百件。全部積案，無論准駁與否，望於五月底前淸理完畢。</p>

<h3>鐵幕下之大連</h3>
<p>— 十六日遼源航訊本報特約記者冰玉</p>
<p>自從美國有一條載送外交郵件及救濟品的船駛到大連以後，有一個美國記者隨行，結果這位記者的觀感，很迅連的傳遍了全世界。這個消息發佈的時間，是去年十二月的下旬，瀋陽正飄着大雪，人們都畏縮的躲在屋裏禦寒，可是聽到美國國務院承認大連刻仍在蘇方軍事管制下的消息，却不禁火辣辣的發熱。</p>
<p>因爲大連是東北的大商港，貿易鼎盛，商務發達，因此成爲東北軍政中心的瀋陽人民，對接收大連更爲關懷，趙參謀長家驤，張特派員劍非的行蹤及蘇大使王外長之間的交涉，尤爲一般人士所注視。</p>
<p>根據民國卅四年八月廿五日國府公布的中蘇友好同盟條約內容要點中關於大速問題，我國雖已宣佈大連爲自由港，對各貿易航運一律開放，但大通一切行政權屬於我國，惟港務長派由蘇籍人員擔任，開放期定爲三十年。因而接收大連的時間問題，衆信當在不遠，爲了中共軍隊在大連到處擾民作亂，旅順大連金山的民衆，在瀋陽屢向當局請願，有關方面人士的推測，以軍事行動來配合接收工作的推進，也是極可能的事。</p>
<p>記者本擬於上月間隨了商旅，赴大運作一巡視，可是，中共盤踞着的大連，絕對不容許任何一個外省人到大連去，相反的，很多的難民却紛紛從大連偷跑出來，在瀋陽過着凄苦的生活。下面是一個前在僞滿時代國民學校的敎員，向記者哭訴今日大連的景象。</p>
<p>自從勝利以後，大連沒有享受到勝利所給予的歡樂，僅在前年十一月以前，由地方各界人士組織了一個臨時性的機構，名爲地方維持委員會，專以維持地方及保護各敵僞產業建築爲主，自從現任共軍「大連市」副市長陳雲濤及「旅順市」副市長陳民立到大連後，即將這維持會解散，對各委員痛駡一頓，儼然以「勝利人物」自居，傲然不可一世。</p>
<p>兩個僞副市長空手到旅大，當然不能推行什麽工作，於是將地方財閥　出來算是「民選」的「市長」，其實還不是在威脅利誘的手段下，硬逼上臺，在共產黨的「政治手法」說來，已是完成「地方自治」了。</p>
<p>外地人也許不會相信，至少也有點疑惑，爲什麽大連當地人去參加「市府」及其他共黨機關的很多呢，特別是婦女？其實，個中原因也非常簡單，膠東的老八路雖是「市府」的幹部人員，大都是「老粗」，連流行的「白話公文」也不會做，（會做的老早是主管人員了）因此，寫寫算算的工作，還祇好讓當地人做，如果不在任何一個機關工作，馬上會有「國特」的頭銜加上來，婦女們爲了避免「公妻」的危險，也就加入「婦女會」服務，因爲還有一點津貼，解救一下經濟的困難。</p>
<p>共黨「市府」爲了陷書士神·及國民黨黨員起見，故意搜集一點資料，列爲共黨市府的名册，其實共黨眞正黨員入黨極嚴，這種愚蠢的陰謀，早爲當地老百姓所識破了。而共黨市府中人員的不學無術，即就傀儡式的「旅大行政聯合辦事處」正副主任遲子祥劉辛，前者是酒囊，後者是飯桶，而管轄大連市郊的「大連縣長」王西平，以前是一家皮鞋商店的夥計，前任「旅大警局」的總局長趙樂斌，誰都知道他是販賣舊貨的「老趙」，大連的老百姓們都說，道種種的現象，一如敵僞時代在日本做過理髮匠的充當縣長，有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>偽市府的組織，雖有各局處之分，但除了財政稅收機關工作最忙碌外，（因爲征錢糧是他們的主要工作）其實建設，公用事業，辦公人員除烤火外，整天就是無所事事。</p>
<p>在表面上，共黨在大連還是公開活動的，其實，特務工作還是秘密的舉行，負責大連地區的是姓韓·宋·孫三個，都是「大連市黨部」的「地方委員」，當地人民祗見他們出外，衛士三四，前呼後擁，却問不出名字，於是背後稱爲宋光，韓光，孫光，分則渾號「光括」，合則爲「三光碼子」。在三春町附近特設「訓練處」，名爲訓練黨員，實爲特務工作硏討的機關，在工作檢討曾上提付討論時，如有發現有欲棄暗投明或是「不忠於黨」，輕則幽禁，重則槍決，因此若干對現實深表不滿的共黨黨員，陽爲高興，私則吊兒郞當，過一天算一天。</p>
<p>以大連共黨黨務情形，階級是很嚴格的，正與「無階級」的高調，適得其反，而「地委」的煊赫，「黨員」的勢利，使「共黨」在一切行政機關中發生了重大決策的作用，任何機關的政委可以推翻其主管的決定，與僞滿政府日籍副員「指導」偽滿官員一樣。</p>
<p>在大連沒有「民主」，連共黨拿手的掛羊頭賣狗肉的「民主政治」也看不到，「鬥爭會」與「淸算會」的工作積極的結果，使游手好閒的無賴們，得到一個以「啦啦隊」爲臨時職業的機會。而拘捕人民，悉聽他們的尊便，「自由」在大連是看不到的。</p>
<p>共軍盤踞下的大連，並無「文化」可言，三張機關報紙—大連日報，實話報，新生時報—銷路很暢，（因爲是掗銷的）消息如同一輒，紙面見到的儘是對共黨歌頌的文章，所謂：「大衆的話」，也無非是杜撰的侮辱政府泯滅天良的東西。</p>
<p>思想統制非常嚴格，全市的無綫電都被沒收，北平南京的消息，誰都聽不到，而坊公所舉行的講習會，却强迫每個居民出席，各僞機關學校的公務人員敎員學生都强迫參加，共黨的特務份子混雜其間，偶有表示不願意者，則必受嚴厲慘酷的處分，即就警局西崗分局，沙河口分局及法院看守所，這些思想犯每天都是滿坑滿谷的。</p>
<p>再言赤化敎育，在大連常有「旅大建國學院」學生，帶着五角帽，這就是最高赤化學府了。六個月卒業，內雖分班系，學員都是各機關調訓的，每天功課甚少，祇是些「社會主義」，「馬克斯思想論」，「新民主主義與聯合政府」，「民主與鬥爭」之類，院長是「地委」韓光，副院長袁牧化，是旅大行政聯合辦事處敎委會主委，也就是「敎育特工」，學生每有認爲「思想動搖」，明天　是逮捕去了，而同學中時有陌生面孔，這是不必多問的，又是思想研究的「專員」了。二所男女市中，也上政治課，由共黨政委担任敎師，其他數理等科每周各三小時，俄文英文每周二小時，前者是重於後者。小學則根本無所謂，每天唱歌要劇，倒使敎員們省了改卷的麻煩了。　「中國文字拉丁化」，是共黨敎育機關的口號，實施後造成了抹殺中國文化的事實。這種毒辣的手段，大連市民個個表示反對，但在共黨鐵蹄壓迫之下，敢怒而不敢言！</p>
<p>現在大迎的工商業，眞使人不相信這是一個大商埠了。</p>
<p>「市府」的稽征工作是太努力了，民營工商業挑不起苛捐的重担，稍有財富，即有被鬥爭的可能，故因「市府」成立不久，倒閉之風即盛，民營工廠又什九被淸算，而「官營」的又怎樣？以民脂民膏組織了裕華·新華，遼東等合作社，糧價物價，隨時調整，海陸運輸工商貿易，祗准公營不許民辦。</p>
<p>今日大連工廠破壞，工人失業，商家被榨，造成了人民生活陷入空前的大貧困，餓殍隨處皆有，乞丐不絕於途，石河車站上的難民，連高粱米也沒有吃，但管理難民的共黨人員，還有狎妓飲酒，作樂尋歡。</p>
<p>在街頭，祗見日本雉妓，食堂門口的日本少女，還不是變相的神女嗎？祗要化「東北銀行」券五百元，她便可以爲你洩慾，這是天堂，還是地獄！</p>
<p>大連港邊，儘是些官營的小汽船在遊弋，武裝的汽艇也時常出巡，除此以外，就是旅大間來往的某方兵艦商船，沿海地域，老百姓是不敢深入的，至多在距港半里的車站偸偸地眺望而已。常可看到的是某方搬運忙，電車，電燈尙有一部份存在，運用四架發電機以後，大連又不時斷水，中央公園的花樹，星浦的遊船，都祗能讓大連的市民來迴溯了，因爲這些都是在被破壞之例。</p>
<p>西崗街回春街兩旁的洋房，十室九空，日僑被遣送回國，市民紛紛逃出來，這些空洋房都成爲難民的集中營，南山也不見遊人，跑馬塲幾成廢墟，機塲跑道亦有破損，在大連已看不到過去的繁華與熱鬧，來往的行人除了耀武揚威的赤色份子外，愁苦，哀鬱的氣氛，瀰漫了整個的大連，在水深火熟中生活着的大速市民，旅順，金縣也是一樣，渴望着政府早日接收大連，讓老百姓們能呼吸一口自由新鮮的空氣！</p>

<h3>蘇州　參議會　別記</h3>
<p>— 本報蘇州八日訊　特派記者吳守仁</p>
<p>蘇州第一屆民選參議會，已於上月十五日正式成立，一百四十三位參議員，都是農·工·商·學各界的碩彥，經過熱烈的競選程序，而榮居了民意的寳座。記者在過去數月間，亦即是這民選大典的醞釀期間，以非常客觀的眼光，去默察各方的動靜；覺得彼此角逐，熱烈，眞是如火如荼。尤其是對於正副議長的選舉，更表現了充分民主的情緒！當然這裏面少不了有因中心人物的不同，而產生若干分歧意見。我們從這種競爭的角度裏，正可以看出今日人民對政治的關切，　臻理想的程度！競爭者中間，大概可分成三　集團：一是以宋績成先生爲中心人物的元老派；另一是環繞着吳聞天先生周圍的少壯派；第三是以敎育界文化界領導人物范公任先生爲中心的敎育派。</p>
<p>嶄新路綫</p>
<p>吳聞天先生自滬返蘇後不久，中央忽發表了任命他爲立法委員的新命；根據法規公職人員是不能兼任民意代表的，取捨的決定，當然是以接受立委放棄參議員爲宜。錢大鈞氏以在野之身，表示了樂於襄助家鄉建設工作的意見；消息傳出後，蘇州朝野頓時轟動，以慕尹老的聲望和地位，正是最台理想的歸宿；不過，要慕尹老出任正議長，這裏面絕非單純的競選問題，主要應該巷他物色一個可以合作的副議長，庶幾有促使慕尹老當仁不讓的把握。然而，事實上這個問題確乎不易解決。</p>
<p>少壯派決定了一條嶄新的路綫，就是擁護錢大鈞氏担任正議長，同時擁護嚴欣淇氏担任副議長的路綫。無疑地，這是一種高度激烈的樊動，敎育派乃自然結合，成爲一個混合的陣營，以擁護宋績成先生任正議長，范公任先生任副議長爲中心思想。</p>
<p>實力估量</p>
<p>我們假使對這新舊二大陣營的基本實力，來公正估量一下的話，其比例是都不够操競選的勝算的；以少壯派爲主體的新陣營，他的基本實力不過整個參議員名額的三分之一，而以元老敎育兩派爲主體的舊陣營，他的蒸本實力，尤其僅佔五分之一；餘下的還有二分之一的多數，完全是毫無黨派的可左可右的中間份子。事實非常明顯，誰能掌握這許多中間份子，誰就眞眞得到了勝利的左券！</p>
<p>中間份子的掌握，並不是單純的活動聯絡所可以奏功；他們往往在許多地方，是足以眞眞代表民意的。因此，掌握中間份子的條件，主要還須看社會民衆心理的動向如何？戰後社會民衆心理，差不多汹湧而泛濫地都着重在求安和求建設的二大前提下；但是，他們廣大的民衆都知道求安和求建設的要素，第一須有堅强經濟的後盾，第二須有豪邁性格的支持，第三須有舉足重輕的德望，三者的要素能够日備，則求安和求建設的心理，縱然沒有立刻兌現的把握，也終算可以存在若干憧憬的希望。社會民衆的心理動向，旣然如此；那末，最能符合這三者要素的人物，乃十分自然地非錢大鈞嚴欣淇兩先生莫屬了！因此，當參議會成立，展開正副議長的選舉時，錢嚴兩氏乃終於以九十七票和八十四票的最大多數產生出任蘇州首屆的正副議長，這一個結果，我們於其說是活動聯絡的成功，毋寗說是社會廣大的民衆心理所造成，來得更見切合事實！</p>
<p>錢氏聲望</p>
<p>但是話又要說回來，社會的民衆心理雖然着重於求安和求建設；可是，怎見得錢嚴兩氏就確乎能够肩荷廣大民衆這兩種期望，而坦然無所猶豫地信，任了他們呢？這裏面的原因不外乎兩點：（一）錢大鈞氏在政治上有相當的潛力和基礎；大家都相信他雖以在野的身份，而仍具有言九重鼎的地位。一旦他担任議長，將來官民之間的閡隔，和民間疾苦，能由他來溝通與宣達，必可發生促使省縣兩方更加重視的作用。（二）嚴欣洪氏在地方經濟上處素領導地位，而歷年來的作風，並未步入資本家的窠臼，對地方社會的公益建設事業，都能樂於贊助扶掖，業爲大衆所共見共喩。由他担任副議長，則將來地方建設事業的推進，至少能收一倡百和的功效；更直接有利於民衆求安和求建設的期望！</p>
<p>嚴氏表示</p>
<p>民衆心理對錢嚴兩氏信仰的分析已如上述，然而，我們應該研究事實上他們究竟能否吻合民衆心理，而酬答蘇州一百十八萬餘人民的仰望之忱呢？這裏可以客觀地報導嚴欣淇氏對今後任務的表示：「我認爲戰後社會環境所予人民的實際痛苦和心理恐懼，實在經緯紛紜錯綜複雜；縱有拯溺解懸的毅力和決心，也決不容易能够緩急相宜地去逐步解救改善。所以一個眞眞的民意機構，要求充分發揮它的功能，首先必須明瞭今日民間疾苦，究竟以何者爲最急迫，何者爲最重要，然後根據了正確的程序去一步步謀解救，求改善，庶不致於緩急倒置，捨本逐末。在我個人的意見，感覺目前民間疾苦的癓結，莫過於農村的不安；而造成農村不安的原因，却又千頭萬緒；掣其綱領來說：主要是農民的負担太重。所以，今後參議會對確定鄉鎭經費，廢除苛雜，曁增加生產，辦理合作運銷等挽救農村經濟標本兼治的大計，將予縝密的硏究，擬訂具體計劃逐步實施。次則公敎人負的情苦，商業經濟的枯竭，失業狂瀾的泛濫等都準備集思廣益，商討有效的補救辦法。至於地方社會浮面的整頓，關係外界觀瞻；我認爲還比較輕而易舉，將率先倡導着手。」</p>
<p>從上述的談話中，我們可以瞭解嚴氏對當前利弊看得非常透澈；同時也可以窺見他對興利除弊的任務，也似乎頗具決心。</p>
<p>就目前說，參議會第一次大會的結果，無疑是蘇州地方社會的命運，決定能不能否極泰來的轉捩點。不過，地方建設工作，匹夫俱有責任，尤其是袞袞參議諸公當仁不讓的權利與義務，必須同一意志去力任艱鉅，庶幾有望；我們認爲競選的階段已經過去，今後應該是和衷共濟的時機了，謹在這裏寄予無限的期望！</p>

<h3>梁燕孫年譜</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>十年來，因爲注意近代史料的原故，就看過許多人的年　，而比較中感覺最有興味的，「三水　燕孫先生年譜」便是其中之一，而和葉　庵年譜尙看，更有意義。</p>
<p>燕孫年譜，自淸同治八年（一八六九）開始。至民國二十二年止，這六十五年中，可以說中國政治，經濟，交通，外交，文化等，都有急劇的變動，梁氏生當該時，且一生的行誼事跡，又和這幾部門，直接的間接的都有密切的關聯。所以這一部年譜，很像具體而微的近代史了。</p>
<p>全畫分上下下兩册，十六開本，共一千餘頁，七十多萬字，可說是洋洋大觀。初版民廿八出版，修正再版，最近出書。插圖四張。</p>
<p>年譜自然以本人一生的行誼事蹟爲基礎，然而若果把一個人的數十年經歷事蹟與著作，一一的敍述與收入，那就恐怕幾百萬字，都不容易，尤其是在政治舞台上的顯要，各方面關係極多，材料豐富，怎麼能够一一收入，「寗缺無濫」的原則就可以應用得到。况且一個人關係旣廣泛，那就有許多事情不能發表或者未到發表時期等等，也不能不割愛，或暫時保留了。那麼，現代人物的年譜和自傳，不容易寫與故意有些遺漏的地方，這是沒有什麽辦法的了。</p>
<p>談到梁燕孫（士詒），他在政治上有着三十年的歷史，恭維他的人，固然很多，同時不明白他在某一時期的環境與某一件事的內幕，而惹起一般人們的誤會，成爲衆矢之的的，也有好幾次的發生，其最著的如五路參案；袁氏盜國時的大典籌備；贖回膠濟鐵路；交通大參案等，都給人們許多傳說，在年譜裏把眞相揭布，使人們明白當時的內蘊。自然當中有些是和其他有關係方面，不能够過於露骨的　情發表，但我們從此也可以比較從前那道聽途說的明瞭許多了。</p>
<p>在史實方面，六十年國內大事，如戊戌變政，義和團亂，高訂藏的，中英續訂禁烟條件，辛亥革命，民國成立，二次革命，中俄協定，二十一條件，袁世凱叛國，再造共和，參加歐戰及招工，溥儀復辟，馬廠討逆，廣州護法政府成立，南北議和，山東問題，直皖戰爭，華盛頓會議，湖南省自治，奉直戰爭，陳烱明叛亂，臨城刧案，曹錕賄選，國民黨第一次全國代表大會，蘇浙戰爭，驅逐　儀出宮，段祺瑞臨時執政，孫總理北上，善後會議，金佛郞案新協定，五卅慘案，國民政府成立，裁廢釐金，國民革命軍北伐張作霖任大元帥，寗漢分裂，全國統一，九一八事件，一二八淞滬之戰，及歷次公債的籌募，交通的建設與財政等重要計劃，都有詳盡的紀載。尤其是財政交通兩部門的事項，說他是三十年的財政交通史，也不爲過。在數十年來的各家年譜中，沒有一部能够比得上他的豐富了。</p>
<p>書中有幾處叙述梁氏應付事變的機警，及其逸聞趣事，如他因避義和團之亂，由北京往懷柔途中所遇到，如云：</p>
<p>「是月（五月）二十一日，先生偕高夫人携妾潘氏，子定薊，定吳及女僕一出京。由陸路先至通州，沿運河乘船南下。同行者關伯珩（免鈞）等男女老幼共百餘人。甫抵木莊，已砲火連天，不能通過，迫得赴河西務。居船上時，沿途無村非壇，無人非拳。所過輙被迫拜壇，焚黄。凡焚黄紙灰不揚，即目爲漢奸，殺無赦。先生以在暴力下，無如何也；乃服寬博之衣，每拜起拂袖，灰輙飛揚，以是多次幸免。一日，關伯珩拜時紙灰不揚。將執之。伯珩色變。先生大呼曰：「關老爺不怕」。團長信關壯繆，多稱關老爺。聞是言。乃釋之。伯珩汗流浹背矣。」</p>
<p>梁氏主講鳳岡書院，也有一風趣事，向例該院月課擇尤取錄六十名，資以膏火。先生爲獎勵寒士計，多列名額，捐金給獎。邑人聞風摹學，一時來者數百人。會邑中有陳某者，宿儒也，年七十矣；會課之日，挈其二子來，爲之捉刀，乘先生他顧，於楹柱後暗遞文稿。先生佯爲不覺。文進，先生批云：「父母愛子之心，無所不至，爲子者亦當以父母之心爲心；他日成名：幸毋忘乃父入暮抱柱時也」。</p>
<p>當直奉戰爭，奉軍敗退軍糧城，梁氏與葉恭綽張弧等，均被通緝褫奪勳位勳章等。據書中所述實情，是「當歸罪令將下時，左右有勸先生通電聲辯者。先生曰：「洪憲之役，予尙爲項城任過，何有於今日！况予自服官以來，以身許國，生死禍福，置之度外久矣，又何辯爲？昔張太岳答吳堯山書曰：「二十年前，曾有一弘願，願以身爲蓐荐，使人寢處其上，溲溺穢垢之，吾無間焉；有欲割取吾耳鼻者，吾亦歡喜施與。」此江陵自信語也。予雖不敢自比江陵，然此願固未嘗忘之，茍下令，予當乘桴浮海，歸侍老父耳。」越夕，忽接北京國務院電話，請先生親聽。與語，則赫然代理國務總理局自齊也。述　職令將下，本人以代揆故，例應副署，對不起數十年老友，請先生見諒，並勸先生即日離津，以避　者。先生曰：（子　）（周字）爲我謝東海，　海潮平，相見或不逮！若爾我兩人，更有何痕跡！他日蒐尋史乘者，以周自齊副署緝梁士詒，亦政治史中佳話也。」語遂止。未幾，周亦被迫辭職，南行訪先生，相見惘然。厥後周病危，召張君名振語之曰。「吾自數平生，惟副署通緝梁燕老事，爲最疚神明；吾死後，幸爲代達。」亦可歡也。」</p>
<p>看此，則知宦海裏波譎變幻是非皂白，沒有一定，不知內幕的，眞如墜五里霧中。尤其是每一次政變，結果對擁兵將帥向不懲罰，祗向三數文人強加罪過，便算了此一宗公案了。</p>
<h3>簡易實驗　無綫電收音機</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>劉同康編著世界書局出版</p>
<p>寫一本優良的基本初步書籍，並不一定比寫一本高深的理論書容易多少，這是件吃力不討好的工作，正像從事於小學敎者不爲人重視一樣。</p>
<p>縱然我國無綫電事業在一般的說還相當發達，可是中文的無綫電書籍却少有出版，而關於初學入門之類的實用書更似鳳毛麟角，不可多得了。本書可以說是僅有的一本，用特鄭重介紹於各位有興趣的無綫電初學同志之前。</p>
<p>全書最大的特點，就是詳而不煩與寓基本理論於實騐。這二點能使初學者不但對無綫電引起探求的興趣，並且啓發他的智慧而能創造新的東西，化爲自身的新血液，新骨肉。書本是死的，它只有一定有限量的內容，可是由於它的啓發，却能將小的推廣成爲大的，死的樊成功活的，因之，可以任意行運而增加書本効用的十倍百倍甚至千倍。有許多小的地方，在老於此道的看來似乎嚕嚕嗦嗦多此一舉，可是（對於一個剛踏進門檻第一脚的朋友却是無可倫比寳貴的指示。舉一個例說，實騐必需應用的焊接工作，在幾個裝拆了好幾年的業餘家們看法以爲不過是普通得不能再普通的工作，又何必多所闡述，可是對於初學者却未始不是一件相當吃力的事情，惟其普通，所以更其重要，試觀世界上日常最平凡普通的工作，又有那一件不是最重要最必需的？一個作家寫一篇短文或者日記那似乎再普通再容易也沒有的了，可是一個小學生塗了半天才寫了個題目呢！無綫電工作尤其如是，一個兒沒人指導瞎摸瞎撞眞不知道要吃多少寃枉虧，多走多少寃枉路，不但費錢費力，並且往往將許多初學的一腔熱心都磨折完了，以爲無綫電是一件難得非凡可望而不可達的東西，因之心灰意懶，半途而廢或者甚至不敢問津，本書的優點就在這兒，它能够成爲初學者一個優良的伴侶，免去許多不必要挫折和意外麻煩。它用簡易的實騐引進初學者墮入無綫電的情網，並且還接予他繼續努力的勇氣。</p>
<p>全書共分五章：先談天地綫的裝設與避雷器，工具，和焊接工作。第二章將無綫電基本零件詳細地介紹一番，不但縷述每一零件的外表，內部構造，効用，性能，而還隨時穿插一些易懂的重要理論以明白其所以然，這使本書成爲一個活用的東西而並非失去了靈魂的軀殼。每種零件還附有淸晣的插圖與特號。後面三章便是礦石機一管機與二管機的製作，這並不是僅有綫路圖與零件表的骷髏骨，而是附有實體接綫圖綫圈繞製法零件裝置排列一以及收音方法實騐成績等有血有肉而易於消化的東西。四張礦石機的棧路都很簡單有效，可是州到分綫器的地方頗多，這東西事實上往往會帶給初學者一些兒麻煩，未免是一個小小的疵點。幾張單管機與二管機的綫路也都是極普通常見的，可是普通常見並不是說它不好，給無數次實騐所淘汰剩下來的東西，也就是最合於實際需要的。</p>
<p>還有値得一提的便是這本書不僅適用於大都市裏的無綫電初學同志，也適用於處在窮鄕僻縣地方的研究者。因爲除了所載的都用直流電源外，更附有AB電池的自製法呢！</p>
<p>最近見到劉先生新編的一本「世界無綫電眞空大全」，覺得先生還在爲無綫電出版事業努力，那我倒衷心希望劉先生能繼本書再寫一册稍　一步的實騐書籍，一定對於許多硏究無綫電的朋友大有裨益的。</p>
<h3>介紹兩部讀書指導的書</h3>
<p>— 黃維廉</p>
<p>略讀指導舉隅精讀指導舉隅　葉紹鈞朱自清合著　商務民三十五年版商務民三十六年版</p>
<p>西哲培根在他的論文集內曾說：「有的書是嘗味的，有的畫是囫圇呑的，再有的是應該細嚼而消化的；換言之，即是有的書是可以略讀的，有的書可隨意讀的，再有的書是應該精讀的。」曾文正公在他的家訓內亦說：「　書之通，看讀寫作四者，每日不可缺一。看者，如看史記，漢書，韓文，近思錄，周易折中之類是也。讀者，如讀四書，詩，書，易經，左傳諸經，昭明文選，李杜韓蘇之詩，韓歐曾王之又，非高聲朗誦，則不能得其雄偉之槪；非密詠恬吟，則不能探其深遠之韻。」看書與讀書，二者不可偏廢。</p>
<p>人們無論做什麼事，都應該具有妥善的方法，然後可收事半功倍之效。吾們對於讀書之道，當然亦應該如此。故讀書也應有人指導，如能懂得讀書的門徑，則不致浪費光陰，勞而無功。如果讀書沒有方法，彷彿如航海沒有羅盤一樣，祇在茫茫大海中飄流，不能達到目的之地。</p>
<p>本文所介紹的兩部書，都是四川省立敎育科學館國文敎學叢刋之一。雖是爲中學國文敎帥參考之用而寫的，但對於普通學子，也是頭有裨益。兩書的編製，方法近似，前有「前言」指導，後有「指導大槪」，惟一爲略讀指導，一爲精讀指導，所選的材料亦各不同。略讀一書內舉了七部書作例子，計經籍一種，名著節本一種，詩歌選本一種，　集兩種，小說兩種；其中「孟子」「史記精華錄」「唐詩三百首」「胡適文選」適於高中學生閱讀，「蔡孑民先生言行　」「吶喊」「愛的敎育」適於初中學生閱讀。</p>
<p>精讀指導一書中選了六篇文作例子，計叙述文一篇，短篇小說一篇，抒情文一篇，說明文一篇，議論文二篇；其中「瀧岡阡表」和「封建論」都是敎科書裏常見的，「第二期抗戰開端吿全國國民書」是在部定的補充敎材一類裏的。尙右魯迅的「藥」，徐志摩的「我所知道的康橋」和胡適的「談新詩」（節本），亦爲普通的中學補充敎材。</p>
<p>因爲兩稱性質不同的敎材，而有兩種不同的指導。「略讀指導必須提綱　領期其自得；精讀指導却須　　不遺，（發揮凈鹽」，這是他們敎學上的經騐之談。在略讀一書的前言指導內，有下列各項的指導如「版本指導」，「序目指導」，「參考書籍指導」，「閱續方法指導」，與「問題指導」。在精讀的前言指導內，有「通讀全文」，「認識生字生語」，「解答敎師所提示的問題」，等等的預習工作；再有「吟誦」，「參讀相關的文字，應對敎師的考問」等等的練習工作。</p>
<p>按上列兩書，原爲讀書指導的工具，所選各篇，旣曰舉隅，當然不能謂盡善，也不能說是標準；似是吾們所要注意而値得介紹的，即是這兩部書可以代表讀書指導的一稱方法。譬如關於國學用書的纂定，已刋行者有數種，前有胡適梁啓超之「國學書目」，後有李笠之「三訂國學用書撰要」，如能依照本書著者　朱兩先生所擬定的體例去做，或是略讀，或是精讀，聽讀者選擇任何幾種國學基本書籍去　心從事硏討，則日就月將，傳可易於入門。</p>
<p>總之，略讀與精讀，誠如曾文正公所言：「譬之兵家戰事，略讀如看書，則攻城爭地，開拓土宇者也；精讀如讀書，則深溝堅壘，得地能守者也。」今日之敎育制度分小學，中學，大學；於小學時期，童年茅塞未開，於實際上所學習的未能得其實際，中學時期確爲最重要之時期，所求之學問，非但應從攻的方而推進，而且應從守的方面堅挺；讀書在此時期，應多費一些硏究書本的工夫，誠如培根所言，有的書宜嘗味的，有的書宜細嚼的，則根固而葉茂，可作將來建樹之　。</p>
<h3>無梯樓雜筆</h3>
<p>— 亦猿</p>
<p>卜少夫著　新聞天地社刊</p>
<p>本書收雜文三十五篇，俱爲著者戰時在後方所寫。因爲著者是一個新聞記者，這集子所收的文章包括有戰時生活的記錄，戰地風景的描繪，人物的速寫，和個人感想的記述，全書行文簡潔明快，雋永的風情，往往三言兩語一加描述，不但絲絲入扣，抑且更覺淸新，令人不忍釋卷，尤其難能可貴的便是高深的大道理，著者寫來，毫不費力，讀者看來，也不頭痛，輕輕帶著幾句，裏面郤蘊蓄著人生處世的良箴。這本集子所收的雜文雖以抒情記實爲主，裏面郤有「載道」之言。嚴肅處就是它的輕鬆處。此其運用之妙，實在使我們的雜文，產生了一種新的文風。</p>
<p>就「載道」的方面說，隨便引證著者的原文，就可以見到：「我們一般的思想觀念，老實說，是被三字經上的那句「勤有功，戲無益」所壟斷，提起　樂，連帶便是無益，這眞害人不淺』著者在此地明顯地在衛着道。可是這個道，郤不是一提到娛樂　想起風化的那些而容上顯很是道貌岸然的道學先生們的道。他在防衛着人類應有娛樂之道，娛樂非即有傷風化之道，娛樂非即浪費之道。現在世界儘多道學先生，或僞道學先生，而著者郤在防衛正道。不過他的衛道，並沒有露出道貌岸然的而容，而夾叙在輕鬆的如狐步舞那樣的旋律中，其可貴者就在此。</p>
<p>這本集子各文，旣寫在戰時，對於戰時生活的描繪，自然最具特色，著者以他銳敏的幽歟感，着實描畫出了幾幅令人起會心之微笑的圖畫；如：</p>
<p>「中午跑進三六九，因爲腸子裏久無油水了，便要了碗四喜麵，堂倌說：</p>
<p>先生！太肥了罷？排骨麵好　？</p>
<p>我連忙的說：不！不！我不怕肥。」</p>
<p>然而這也是一幅多少令人感歎的戰時生活圖畫！</p>
<p>我鄭重地將此書介紹給愛好文學，歷史，戰時生活的記錄亦是一種歷史），和幽默的人。這是一本値得一看的書。</p>

<h3>遊江郎山偶誌</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>越淡東去水溶溶，回首鄕關隔萬重。</p>
<p>明日江郞山下過，碧雲深處插芙蓉。</p>
<p>江郞山在浙江江山縣，爲東南第一奇峭之峯，自石門鄕行數里，先見碧雲中高插芙蓉，　然合抱，繼見峯歧爲二，　然並峙，行至其正面，則如川字形，顯爲三峯矣。故又名三爿石。</p>
<p>三爿石中一峯略低，遠望之，似上寬而下削，旣逼近，始知不然，與徐霞客所記上銳下歛之語相合也。由余家塢而上約三里，過化石亭，上十八曲，而抵開明寺，前有唐明經祝東山蔓，又爲鳳林明代高士周文興讀書故廬。寺中人贈予等以大茶葉片及石載還魂草等土產。從寺之後門出，登鐘鼓洞，放爆，聲震如鐘鼓。次由大凹穿人，仰望懸崖，壁立萬仭。予曾過四川劍門關，覺劍鬥雖雄偉，然決不能似此奇峭。沿岩行，慄慄滋懼，　箬葉作蔔行蛇狀，脚下濕漉，浸昨日之雨。登高處稍憇，再轉小凹而下，如行長　中，仰視神眩氣奪，岩下有石穀與還魂草，拾得少許，復放爆仗，聲轟然驚天地，回響尤高。下山，至江郞寺休息。</p>
<p>方與勝略云：</p>
<p>「江郞山又名玉郞山，一名金　山，距江山縣城五十里，高六百尋。一名須郞山·」東陽記云：「金純山有三峯，悉數百尺，色丹奪目，不可仰視。」太平寰宇記云：「江鄰山有五色石，日照炫耀。」今日親之，殊不盡然。</p>
<p>山頂人跡所不能至，據云其上有池，產碧蓮金　，爲仙人居。山半有岩，危石縣空，中可結廬。</p>
<p>香山詩云：「林慮雙童長不食，江郎三子夢還家。安得此身生羽翼，與君來往醉烟霞。」蓋據文思博要所云：「江氏兄弟三人登　化爲石」而來。殆以此三　過於奇特，故神其說耳。</p>
<h3>春浴華清</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>長安早春；你看終南太白諸山積雪未融，而涇渭之間便已青草茁生了。吃足了三冬黃沙之後，人們自然會想起「春寒賜浴華溥池」的故事。</p>
<p>華淸池在陝西臨潼縣南門外，東出長安四十華里，火車行一時許可到；背倚　山，前望漠野，有亭台，小橋，荷池，花圃之勝、依溫泉流勢　浴室數間，中最精緻且令人神往的，是貴妃池。</p>
<p>貴妃池可供四人合浴，朱欄玉砌，嵌以乳色玻窗，池內鋼白蓮朶朶；彼光蕩漾中，你底思念愈飄愈遠了；那白烟氳鬱下滑膩的泉水，誰說未留下貴妃的餘脂？</p>
<p>山道上，中山林矮松夾途，地頗僻靜，有三元洞，地母廟，老君殿等小寺院　綴附近；中正林以開建未久，所植樹苗伶仃可憐，惟石徑整潔，便於游客上下。由中正林上行未久，經過西安事變時主席蒙難處，滿壁琳瑯，盡出黨國聞人手跡；這方凸出的峯壁，拱團傘蓋着一方大靑石；如打坐石上，山　，山左，山右，都蔽而不見，只看到山底遠方的坡田村樹，和一綫渭水蜿蜒東流。</p>
<p>山鮮奇峯元石；綠蔭亦稀，僅高處矮松　抱。半山腰　有　山古刹，陰沈淸寂，殿側老槐上烏鴉吱喳，令人生恍然天外之感。有數道士在焉。山巓即周幽王烽火台，空闊坦露；三千年前，此處曾有靑烟柱直捲　漢，山下四方諸候雲集，古天子的風流荒唐，終博得美人一　，然而王朝從此休矣。</p>
<h3>日月潭之旅</h3>
<p>— 鳳茜</p>
<p>當汽車駛出台南不久，我們已漸漸離開廣漠的田野，盡在向萬山叢中奔馳了。穿過許多深　的山洞，和高架的橋樑。探首外望，汽車已轉駛入白雲裏，一陣輕霧過後，山中的景色，豁然開朗，濁水溪細長得像一條花帶，曲延在天際山間，而眼前的還是一　　暗綠色山　。</p>
<p>這樣在山中走了三小時，才到了台灣八景之一的日月潭，一片美麗的湖光，給旅人無限喜悅。而掩　在萬綠叢中涵碧樓，也近在目前了。涵碧樓是日月潭畔唯一的旅社，據山臨水，四面盡是方格子的琉璃小窗，憑欄眺望，閃盪在森林裏湖光山色，盡人眼　，我們當然也在這裏休息了。</p>
<p>淸晨，白茫霧的茫幕，給湖上添了淡淡地晨裝，當早霧隨着時光消逝時，湖水似鏡，把四週靑山的影子，淸楚的印了下來，偶然有一艘捕魚的獨木船無　色地飄過，在墨綠湖鏡上劃出銀亮的白光，這時，萬　俱消，似乎整個宇宙都像平靜了。</p>
<p>而黃昏　景色更美，瑰麗的斜暉把遠山染得一片淡紫，一片灰藍，假如你是一個畫人，任憑你恁地硬着心腸，　興卻也關不住了。</p>
<p>到日月潭的旅客，誰也不願放棄訪問那水社大山下化番部落的。我們乘着小電船渡湖，在對岸的蕃村登陸，那廿多所茅蓬的蕃　在火熱陽光下閃耀着乳黃色。當我們走到蕃村時，已有三四十個蕃民跑來歡迎，他們穿的是漢人衣服，操熟練閩南語，已看不出土蕃的遺跡了。但當我們說明來意，要看「化蕃杵歌」時，十幾個年靑的婦女立刻趕回家去換裝，日換星移，她們已穿着她們呱先的衣服，陸續從家中出來了，深藍色連胸的畏裙，腹前緊束了五彩花帶，上身加淺藍色短衿，長袖的外衣，頭上戴珠圈，插花朶，充滿了原始人的意味。手裏每人執有八尺長的木杵，年紀稍老的帶二尺長竹筒，敲出「冬冬……」的聲音。</p>
<p>歌舞開始，她們川木杵不斷敲在石板上，發出「蓬蓬」的聲音，和上竹筒聲，奏出異樣租野的旋律，在音樂聲中，她們表現近似菲洲土人般的舞踊，唱着情使我們恍若回復到原始時代。</p>
<h3>九溪十八澗</h3>
<p>— 浩</p>
<p>龍井村朝北的一段山路，包括了九溪十八澗，所謂的九溪十八測，也僅是九條溪，十八條　而已，本沒有什麼奇特處，但是你不知那山路是多麽的崎嶇，二旁是高聳的尖峯，在崎嶇的山路裏，却有着一條淸可見底的泉流，有幾槐石子凸出了水面。使流水對它繞上一個似圓非　的水紋，當流水跑過一塊天然的石板的時候，更會無情的和石板擊出一種滴溜溜的聲音來，偶而飛來了一隻小鳥，唧唧的呌着，和這聲音交織成猶如「小夜曲」一般幽靜的曲譜，山地裏，人們給陶醉在春色裏了。</p>
<h3>狼山是大江北岸南通以南的名勝，憑江倚山，不愧爲一水山嫵媚的地方。</h3>
<p>— 玉泓</p>
<h3>日月潭畔水社蕃酋長之女</h3>
<p>— 鳳茜繪</p>
<h3>西湖的美</h3>
<p>— 面壁</p>
<p>我說西湖的美，宜乎遠觀，不宜於近視。所以深遊不如坐觀，要領略他的佳處，最好是在湖畔尋一個很適當的位置坐下，然後悠然地四面望去，則目前一片，儼然是一幅天然的圖畫。四圍山色中，一漿碧波裏。到這時候，山不厭其低了，即使是童山，反恰好構成了淡淡一抹的襯景。水不　其小，若眞有太湖洞庭似的大，反不能有如此蕩漾的美了。大凡所謂美者，都是或一程度的凝視的錯覺。進而更陶然於此錯覺中，於是就李樂到一種對美的快感了。若仔細審視起來，是很難說有什麽東西是美的。譬如說，一個破落的廟宇罷，你如特誠造門拜訪，是準會呌你大失所望而回的。但如果他的位置恰在山間水邊，外面有些草木之類，那麽你如從遠處遙遙望去，則但見雜樹掩映，透露出半壁破瓦紅牆，飛簷一角，那時，不但不覺其破敗，郤反成了絕妙的一景了。我不是說，西湖所有的，都是些破殘敗落的要不得的東西，不能細看，只好在遠遠的地方，隱約看去，自取陶醉而已，而是說所謂風景佳勝這回事，其妙處都在宜乎遠觀，而西湖就是其中之一耳。但這又不是那些專向人多處擁去的遊客們所能了解的吧。</p>
<p>桃花櫻花都已闌珊，「開到蘼蕪花事了」一春又將過去了罷。湖遊歸來，追記所感，也算是一個小小的紀念罷。</p>
<h3>矮人洞</h3>
<p>— W.F.</p>
<p>本人於春　期中偕友赴杭州遊覽。於北上高峯半山途中，突發現小山洞一，前有「香山洞」三字，洞口甚小且低，俯身而入，洞內復陰暗無光，摸索前進，忽覺似有一怪物在暗角移動，衆皆驚懼而退，獨本人好奇而擦火上前照視之，知乃一矮人也。叩之，答姓沈，年已五十有七，由徽州來洞居住，已逾半世，復見其身長僅三尺，體格魁梧，惟頭大似巴斗，禿髮，貌則甚和藹司親，旣偕出洞。乃合攝一影（附照）於洞前以留紀念。</p>
<p>竊以春日遊杭者固衆，然知此洞而有此奇人者恐甚鮮也，因特將此意外奇遇公開於愛好春遊者之前。</p>
<h3>遊春曲</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>紫燕呢喃入畫樓，春光大半欲歸休。倉庚縱使喚人住，爭奈鬢毛易白頭。心兀兀；恨悠悠。著書難令遺窮愁；不如約伴尋芳去，日麗風和陌上遊。隨心覽勝澄江側，翡翠珊瑚皆春色，嫩柳垂條芽未舒，嫣花着地胚將出。臨流別有窈窕女，玉貌盈盈嬌無語；纎手經揉浣碧紗，楚腰款擺芙蓉渡。帶笑迴眸似見招，烏　　散任風飄；紅霞飛上桃花頰，運步姗姗過畫橋，幾家墓畔拜遊魂，流水凄咽落照昏！我亦多情禁不住，歸來偸自拭啼痕。</p>
<h3>圌山勝蹟</h3>
<p>— 易金</p>
<p>在鎭江，如果提起了遊春的話，那誰都會想起金焦，北固，或者南郊，因爲這些是時代的「寵兒」，是省會的「嬌客」。</p>
<p>「圖山」，這個名字，或許會有人覺得陌生吧！本來他不是一個遐邇馳名的「佳人」，而是一個沒落在鄉野的不知名的「英雄」，他沒有嬌小，輕盈，溫柔，羞澀的處子態，也沒有經過人爲的塗脂抹粉的矯揉做作。那英峻，挺拔，豪邁，放蕩的雄姿，是自然的，是天賦的英雄本色。</p>
<p>在鎭江東鄕，先烈趙伯先故里——大港鎭—以東八里，便是圖山的所在地，距鎭江城四十四里。</p>
<p>那高聳矗立的圃峯塔影，在周圍數十里方圓以內，都可以看到，尤其當夕陽西垂，晚霞滿天的時侯，山上反映出忽紫忽紅或黄或綠的燦爛色彩，瞬息千樊，更屬奇觀。</p>
<p>從山脚到山頂，約三四里，山勢陡峭，石級蜿蜒而上，本來雄踞山巓的「大雄寳殿」，在廿六年冬被敵人的砲火摧毁了。</p>
<p>「洞」是圖山的唯一勝蹟，去遊山的話，最主要的就是「遊洞」。據土人傳說：「全山上下，大小石洞共有七十二個」。此說雖然未見正確，但是足可一觀的石洞確有二三十處，而且這許多洞都全天造地設，絕少經過人工修飾的，在每一個洞內或者洞的左右，都有一個小庵，可供遊人憇　進膳。</p>
<p>最奇的一個是「箭洞」。洞穿在山腰雄厚的石壁上，成圓形，直徑高約一丈多，從山南可透視山北，眞是別有洞天，相傳此洞是當日劉伯　一箭射穿，故有斯名。</p>
<p>最大的是「仙人洞」有三間大屋那麼大小，成長方形，高約三丈，四周石壁挺立，人在洞中，舉首上望，但見怪石崢嶙，倒懸半空，令人心驚慨歎。</p>
<p>「桃仙洞」最美麗，洞外建有小樓，洞內一彎淸泉，澄潔可鑑，四週山坡上桃樹成林，每當暮春三月，桃華盛開，嬌整絢爛，簡直是一個粉紅色的世界。</p>
<p>「觀音洞」最深長，裏面有觀音殿，有閣樓，有廚房，有臥室。</p>
<p>此外還有蝙蝠洞，白鴿洞，螃蟹洞，白龍洞，呂仙洞，螺螄洞，烟袋洞，荷包洞……等，有的深遂，有的曲折，有的突元，有的怪異……，都足令人遊而不厭，嘆爲觀止。</p>
<p>一年一度的黄明到了，四鄕八鎮的男女，又將去一　雄姿，一廣眼界了。</p>
<h3>莫愁湖與燕子磯</h3>
<p>— 芥子　春</p>
<p>當穀雨節的前後，走出水西門，離開車馬喧閙的市塵，臨水人家，在放着鴨子，一塊塊菜畦，鋪平了金色花朶。行盡邨落，樓台掩映，春水參差，已行近莫愁湖畔。</p>
<p>沿湖的兩岸走去，是華嚴庵，庵後有勝　樓，傳聞明太祖會於此和中山王徐達賭過基，他老人家賭輸了，把湖產送給徐氏，故有斯名。樓上供着　位恢復國土的一代民族英雄遺像，颯爽英姿，猶可想見當年風度。兩側楹聯，更是好語如珠，琳瑯滿目。</p>
<p>樓後　爲　金堂故址，內供盧莫愁　　，横扁上題着：「是耶非耶」四字，莫愁故事，流傳民間，輾轉相因，莫　一是，正不必膠柱　瑟，爲她考證出身，來歷。</p>
<p>在這靜悄悄的鬱金堂上，俯檻臨流，正荻蘆抽碧，春水方生，接喋游魚，出沒可數，東邊是石頭城，雉蝶山迴，富闕壯麗，武鄕侯所讀：「鍾紆龍盤，石城虎踞」。確是忠實的介紹。縱目一看，那淸凉山，鍾阜，盧龍，横互在前面，遙遙和長江北的一些山峯相連續。水是一片拖藍，山是一抹横黛，極空曠平遠的能事，玄武湖何曾有此境槪！</p>
<p>落日銜山時候，走下了勝基樓，回頭一看，那石頭城淸凉門上，已是微光　　，燈火黄昏。新月初升，湖烟四合，埀楊　嫋晚風中，另　一種淸凄意味。不禁低吟　樓上的　聯：「說什麽蓋世英雄，丞相空留遺像在；漫逍遙一湖風月，莫愁正是善愁人」！</p>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>近幾天各地到杭州的遊客，蜂擁而至，湖上更如　如狂，但我們店住天堂的人，却又想到別處去春遊，適巧有一個幾會，得往首都觀光，南京原爲舊遊之地，近郊名勝多已欣賞，這次又得一遊燕子磯。</p>
<p>坐汽車越過煤炭港，轉到上元里，就另有一番風光，狹畏向曲折的石子路，高低隱伏，右首石　亘綿，巒峯不斷，左邊長江似襟，阡陌腴田，雖然汽車走得快，但愈顯出牠的曲折，看看是「山窮水盡」，行行却又「路轉峯迴」，單是這條山徑，已够使你讚美了。</p>
<p>停車三台洞裏面相當寬敞，嚴穴滴水，積成淺淺一池，淸徹晶瑩，可以淸心，二台洞沒有什麽可看，到了頭台洞神話多了不少，「龍頭龍　」呀，「犀牛望日」呀，新非均是洞石象形的故事。</p>
<p>燕子磯和別的山峯一樣，一層一級往上爬，不過上面仍有奇峻的峯頭，站在上而往下瞧，江水滔滔，淘盡了幾許英雄，何况這裏又是一般厭世者的絕好歸宿處，「想一想」三字碑，雖會呌人「懸崖勒馬」，但誰又願去「隨波逐流」「還不是環境逼迫而已」。</p>
<p>走下山再僱一小舟，撑到山峯前邊的江面，一賞「燕子」的廬山眞面，祗覺峻險崢崚，峭壁宛如飛燕，倘再高插入雲，那就更加奇絕了，回到觀香閣經了老道的指點，增見山腰懸下一條鐵練，長僅尺許，他說是明朝封鎖長江繫船用的，姑不論眞僞，當時江水，是直到半山無疑，滄海桑田，變遷幾易了。坐下和一位年高九十一歲的白髮老嫗，閒話山居景况，偌大年紀，還能隻手　磨，談笑自如，詢彼食糧市價，竟茫然不知，瞬答有幾十鋼子一升的話，眞覺「不知有漢」了。</p>
<p>回來風馳電掣於蒼翠曲徑中，　是絕妙住境。</p>
<p>— 春</p>
<h3>推薦「農業金融簡論」</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>王世頴是中國合作事業的先進之一。二十年來他一心一意於合作事業的推廣，尤其對於農業金融一項，特別發生了興趣，也特別加以關切。抗戰期內，他在各大學講授的，就是農業金融，民國二十八年，那時他在重慶，曾編了一本「農業金融綱要」，當時印了三百册，供中央政治學校合作學院同學的參攷。民國卅年，復編寫了一本「農業金融簡論」，內客分六章，體裁以理論爲經，以各國事例爲緯，於農業信用各方面，詳述無餘，初版有限，早已售罄。最近始由「中國圖書用品生產合作社」重版印行，後附錄三篇，如「農業金融之使命」等，均係就農業金融方面，有所闡發的力作。</p>
<p>著者認爲「我國的經濟建設，工農必須並重，而農業建設的新設施中，農業金融制度之確立尤爲關鍵所在」，而「合作事業之推行，有賴於農業金融之處亦復甚多」。</p>
<p>他又認爲「農業金融問題，決不單是農民生活上之救濟問題，更不是因爲農業瀕於破產　引起的問題。農業金融問題，乃是一個國家在經常局面下的經常問題」。</p>
<p>這個看法自然極爲正確的。這是理論，但也是事實。他現在身任合作事業局局長，最近到上海來時，他曾提到，此刻正實施理論；對於農村金融設施正在堅苦努力；不過他也嘆息，怕自身看不到這個種子的開花結果。從他言語中，可見他對於合作主義如何的熱烈，而目光注射於農村，着意改善農村生活的用心是如何深長了。</p>
<p>我推薦道本「農業金融簡論」，目的也不僅僅乎勸大家讀這本書而已，希望讀這書的人也能和著者那麽，目光放大一點眞正注意到我們所應担負的任務。</p>

<h3>Promise to Return Power to the People Fulfilled; Government Reorganization Announced Complete; Government Committee Approves New Candidates for Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Government Committee, composed of representatives from various parties and factions, as well as social elites, was officially established on the 23rd, succeeding the Supreme National Defense Council as the highest decision-making body of the central government. The establishment of the National Government Committee today did not involve any ceremony, and was only announced by Chairman Chiang at the beginning of the meeting. However, the Chairman then delivered a speech with a pleasant mood, stating that this government reorganization was an epoch-making initiative with extremely significant meaning, and briefly explained the National Government's policy direction. The first meeting then began immediately, lasting for an hour and a half before concluding. After the meeting, all members took a group photo as a memento, and the Chairman frequently said "Good, good, see you again" when announcing the adjournment.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] The National Government Committee was established on the 23rd, Minister Peng Xuepei announced at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists. The one-party rule has ended today (the 23rd), and the Kuomintang has fulfilled its promise to return power to the people, and has realized its national construction program from tutelage to constitutionalism. This procedure was completed this morning. The multi-party National Government Committee has been formally established, and the Executive Yuan has also been reorganized, including members of various parties and non-partisan individuals. Following the participation of various parties in the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, the multi-party transitional government established today will exercise its powers in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, complete the preparations for the implementation of the Constitution, until the establishment of a government formed in accordance with the Constitution.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The reorganized National Government Committee was officially established on the 23rd. The first meeting (i.e., the State Council meeting) was held at the National Government at 10:00 AM. Attendees included: Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Sun, and Committee Members Zhang Qun, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Zhangjia, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, Wang Yunwu, and others. Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, and Bao Erhan were excused. He Luzhi and Wu Xianyu had not yet arrived in Nanjing. In attendance was Secretary-General Wu Dingchang. Chairman Chiang first announced the establishment of the National Government Committee and delivered a speech. After the speech, the first meeting was held, resolving the following important matters:</p>
<p>(1) A report on the National Government's policy direction was approved for record.</p>
<p>(2) Amendments to the rules of procedure for the National Government Committee meetings were approved.</p>
<p>(3) The Premier of the Executive Yuan proposed candidates for Political Councilors and Ministers of the Executive Yuan, which were approved.</p>
<p>(The appointment and removal orders for these candidates were all announced by the National Government on the 23rd. Note: The list can be found in a separate table.)</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 11:10 AM, and all members left the National Government in succession. At this time, reporters from various newspapers were waiting outside the venue. Shao Lizi, Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, and others were at the front, all wearing traditional Chinese robes and jackets, with Shao Lizi beaming. Reporters interviewed various government committee members separately. Chen Bulei told reporters: "The establishment of the National Government Committee is an epoch-making event. I hope everyone will be of one heart and one mind to create a new situation!" Sun Ke said: "Very good."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Tells Reporters: Willing to Strive for Democracy</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun said: "I have already made a broadcast, so I won't say anything more now." However, after being pressed by reporters, he said: "I will strive for peace, construction, unification, and democracy." Wang Yunwu replied with a smile: "I just learned one thing, and now I will start learning another thing." (Note: Wang is referring to having just headed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and now being transferred to Deputy Premier.) At 11:30 AM, the Chairman took a car directly back to his official residence, and the new government committee members also left in droves.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, attended the State Council meeting on the morning of the 23rd, and then went to the Executive Yuan at 3:00 PM to inspect his duties. The heads of various ministries and his friends Xu Kan, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Qingyun, Chen Ce, Ma Chaojun, and others went to the Executive Yuan to offer their congratulations. Our newspaper's reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang in the Premier's office at 4:00 PM, asking about his policy direction. Mr. Zhang said: "My opinion is that, apart from what Minister Peng has announced at the press conference, I have nothing else to say." Regarding whether the treatment of civil servants will be adjusted, Mr. Zhang said: "It is already in the planning. I am not only paying attention to the lives of public educators, but also to the lives of the people of the whole country."</p>

<h3>After Taking Office as Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun Makes His First Broadcast, Elaborating on Domestic and Foreign Policies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan delivered his first broadcast speech to the people of the country at the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 PM on the 23rd. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of China has been promulgated for nearly four months, and the Chinese Kuomintang has begun to end tutelage, expand the foundation of the government, and tentatively implement the responsibility system of the Executive Yuan in advance, according to the spirit of the Constitution. In the next eight months, it is the transitional stage from tutelage to constitutionalism. On the one hand, the government must complete the work of preparing for constitutionalism, and at the same time, it is more urgent to restore national unity and stability, and solve the current serious financial and economic problems. The tasks are extremely arduous, and the success or failure of these matters is related to the century-long governance, order, security, and danger of the country. I, in this period, have been appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan. I am truly afraid that my talent is not enough. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, has long drafted the Outline of National Construction, which serves as the highest guiding principle for our nation. Regarding the important political and economic measures at the current stage, the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee are also very comprehensive. As for the policy direction after the government reorganization, agreements have been reached with various parties and social elites. I can only follow the public will under the leadership of the Chairman and shoulder this heavy responsibility. At this critical juncture, all difficulties and obstacles can be foreseen, but I dare not decline the labor and resentment, nor do I care about personal success or failure. I will concentrate my efforts, devote myself to the cause, and strive for unity, democracy, peace, and construction. I will not avoid any sacrifice. On the occasion of taking office today, I would like to present a few key points of governance to my fellow countrymen and appeal for national unity.</p>

<p>Military Restoration of Order; Government Had No Choice</p>
<p>Today, the most important thing that China needs is stability and unity. This is the prerequisite for all construction. Since the end of the War of Resistance, the government has consistently sought a political solution to the CCP issue with the highest enthusiasm and patience. In the past year or so, I have repeatedly participated in peace and unification talks under the instructions of the Chairman. Unfortunately, the situation has evolved to this day, and the CCP has closed the door to peace negotiations with comprehensive military action, rendering all past efforts futile. In order to restore order and ensure unification, the government had no choice but to take effective military measures. This is the current need of the country and the demand of the people, and the government has to shoulder this responsibility, but I feel deeply pained in my heart. I hope that this effective measure can quickly achieve the fundamental goal of resolving domestic disputes and restoring unification through political means. As for the government's consistent determination to pursue peace, it will not change because of this.</p>
<p>Deep Financial and Economic Crisis; Decided to Treat Both Symptoms and Root Causes</p>
<p>China has gone through eight years of arduous war, the nation's vitality has been depleted, and the people's lives are miserable. In addition, the domestic turmoil for more than a year after the war has deepened the national financial and social economic crisis day by day. In terms of treating the symptoms, the government has already promulgated an emergency economic measures plan, and will continue to implement it effectively. In terms of treating the root causes, the government will also gradually implement the established plan. Now I must strongly emphasize that, since the national economy and the people's livelihood are so urgent, we cannot make mistakes again. The government's future measures must be particularly cautious, focusing on fundamental solutions and less on minor details. Anything that is not related to budget balance and currency reform, or that is not urgently important to the national economy and the people's livelihood, should never be acted upon rashly, so as to seek progress from stability. We must also strive to support private economic enterprises, so that social idle capital can be used for production. The government's integrity and trustworthiness are the foundation of all progress and reform.</p>
<p>Enforce Law and Discipline, Eliminate Corruption, and Protect People's Freedom</p>
<p>Regarding political reform, the government should earnestly assume the responsibility of revitalizing and eliminating malpractices, strictly enforce law and discipline, eliminate corruption, eliminate vanity and procrastination, and improve administrative efficiency. In particular, I hope that leaders at all levels will grasp the goal, set an example, be strict with themselves, be fair in dealing with affairs, reward without favoritism, punish without avoiding relatives, and jointly establish a political atmosphere of respecting the law and seeking truth. As for the protection of the people's freedom and rights, this is the most important work in preparing for constitutionalism. The government should, in accordance with the Constitution and the policy direction after the reorganization, protect the freedom that all people should enjoy in accordance with the law. I also hope that people all over the country will recognize the dignity of the law, improve the spirit of abiding by the law, and strengthen their sense of responsibility to the country, so that the rule of law and freedom can complement each other and enter the normal track of constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Peaceful Coexistence with Foreign Countries; Strive to Enhance Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>In terms of foreign relations, what China earnestly desires is a world of peace, justice, friendship, and cooperation. This is China's traditional spirit, and it is also the need of the facts. Therefore, the Chinese government is determined to adhere to its consistent position, coexist peacefully with all friendly countries in the world, and continue the friendship of fighting side by side with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, and strive to enhance diplomatic relations between them. All outstanding issues that hinder diplomatic relations are willing to follow the diplomatic path and seek reasonable solutions. We must also strive to promote the harmonious relationship between the allied countries and ensure world peace. China will never shirk its responsibility for handling various post-war international issues and establishing a world peace order and cooperative relationship, nor will it give up its international status. We uphold the Charter of the United Nations, faithfully fulfill our treaty obligations, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of friendly countries, and we also have the firmest determination to maintain our country's independence, sovereignty, and international status.</p>
<p>Unleash Potential Strength; Strive to Revitalize the Cause</p>
<p>Today, the country's difficulties have reached the most serious juncture, and there are so many things to be done and reformed. However, China has a solid potential strength, and the people also have political enthusiasm. We certainly do not underestimate the current difficulties and obstacles, but if we can concentrate the efforts of the whole people to unleash the country's potential strength, we have absolutely no reason to be pessimistic about the future of China's revitalization. The government should select key points from thousands of threads, concentrate its efforts, be sincere, do practical things, and hope that it will benefit the country. The people of the whole country must also eliminate inertia, abide by laws and regulations, be brave and resolute, and work together with the government to revitalize the cause. If the government's laws and regulations are not faithfully implemented, or if the people's sufferings and demands are not reached by the government's eyes, ears, and mind, I hope that we can make up for the shortcomings of the government with the effectiveness of collective wisdom. If there are active, effective, and tangible proposals, the government will be happy to adopt them. I have served in the military and government for more than 30 years, and I am ashamed that I have not made many achievements. The only thing I can be confident in is that I have never dared to violate the law for personal gain, nor have I ever cared about personal gains or losses. Now, I have been appointed to a difficult task, based on the great righteousness of entrusting myself to the country and sharing weal and woe. I will do my best to be loyal and strive to restore unity, complete the preparation for constitutionalism, break through the economic difficulties, and improve the people's lives. I hope not to disappoint the sympathy and expectations of my fellow countrymen and comrades in the Party. (End)</p>

<h3>Acheson's Speech</h3>
<p>More Than One Million U.S. Dollars of Lend-Lease Materials</p>
<p>Were Obstructed by Congress and Could Not Be Shipped to China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson said at a press conference today: The lend-lease materials with a value of 1.4 million U.S. dollars that the United States and China agreed to allocate to China could not be delivered to China because the U.S. Congress passed a bill prohibiting the State Department from shipping materials worth 25 million U.S. dollars to eleven countries from November 1 last year. According to the agreement, since China signed a contract with the United States for civilian lend-lease materials worth 50 million U.S. dollars after the victory over Japan, all of the materials except the above-mentioned 1.4 million U.S. dollars have been shipped to China. The Soviet Union has entered into a contract with the United States for lend-lease materials worth 1 billion and 100 million U.S. dollars. These materials are either waiting to be shipped or are being manufactured. The U.S. Congress is now withholding materials worth 16.7 million U.S. dollars by not allowing the Treasury Department to handle and allocate all necessary plans related to these materials (even if all funds are borne by the country receiving the materials). According to Congress's purpose, it is mainly for the Soviet Union, but the lend-lease materials to China, France, Austria, and other countries that have signed lend-lease materials contracts with the United States are also obstructed as a result. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to Congress to abide by the contracts signed between the United States and other countries was also ignored by Congress.</p>

The assets of the five traitors, except for what is necessary for the living of their families, will be confiscated.</p>

<h3>On Participating in the National Government - The Youth Party Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Zeng Qi and others, representing the Chinese Youth Party, issued a statement on participating in the National Government, which read: "The basis for our participation in the government this time is based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in the long term, and on the twelve governing principles jointly agreed upon by the Kuomintang, Youth, and Democratic parties in the near term. Considering that a political party that has been in opposition for twenty-four years has resolutely come forward to share responsibility at a time of national crisis, there must be a way of conduct that is shared with the world. We respectfully offer two meanings to the people of the country: (1) Although China has now destroyed the strong enemy and won the Anti-Japanese War, the confusion of national affairs and the decline of people's livelihood are no less than in the past. There are thousands of ways to save the situation, but the most important thing is to stabilize the foundation of the country. The Chinese people do not want to see foreign aggression again, nor do they want to see the division of the country again. The legal nationals and the government only hope that democracy can be gradually realized under the principle of freedom and progress. The participation of opposition parties in the government can enable the National Government to achieve peaceful reform internally and gain international respect externally, so that China will not fall into a state of disintegration and chaos in the future. Only when the state affairs are settled can the people's hearts be at peace, and only when the people's hearts are at peace will all ambitious people have no opportunity to subvert the foundation of the country. This is also why our party must come out and jointly shoulder national policies with all patriotic parties for the sake of stabilizing the country.</p>
<p>Thirty-six years after the founding of the Republic of China, democratic politics has not yet been realized. The promotion of democratic politics depends on a number of democratic parties who cut and study each other's policies, and do not compete with each other with thousands of ge and thousands of jia, competing for seats and not competing for battlefields. Although there are many political parties in the country today, there are few who can deeply understand this meaning and follow the normal track of party politics to compete openly in a peaceful way. Our party has been guiding democracy for more than twenty years and has always regarded itself as the orthodox of democracy. What China needs today is a peaceful opposition party. If the policy is feasible, it will be in power, and if the policy is not feasible, it will retire and be in the opposition. Our party is not talented and secretly willing to follow this meaning, and also hopes that all parties in the country will follow this track to strive for democracy by democratic methods, and not to strive for democracy by methods other than democracy. Today, the country is in the transitional stage from the end of political tutelage to the beginning of constitutional government. How can a political party with democratic constitutionalism as its goal stand by and shirk its responsibilities? This is also why our party must come out and jointly shoulder national policies with all patriotic parties for the sake of advancing democracy.</p>
<p>What's more, the renewal of state affairs and the promotion of democracy are not only closely related to the reform of the central government, but also to the comprehensive promotion of the foundation from the bottom up. If democratic knowledge is not popularized among the people, and if the power of democracy is not deeply rooted in the grassroots, then the foundation of constitutional government cannot be said to be completed, and the long-term stability and peace of the country cannot be said to be free from worry. This is what our party is willing to work together with all parties in the country and social elites.</p>
<p>Chen Qitian and Chang Naihui Talk</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Qitian, the newly appointed government member of the Youth Party, met with our newspaper's reporter at 5:00 PM on the 23rd. The reporter first asked that the National Government should be a multi-party political government from today onwards, but some people also call it a multi-party tutelage government. What is Mr. Chen's opinion? Chen replied: "I do not agree with multi-party tutelage government. I believe that democracy is a gradual development and a gradual step forward. The current stage is still preliminary. We have had today after twenty years of training. We believe that in three or five years, we will be able to move towards multi-party politics and reach the realm of democracy." The reporter then asked when the Youth Party will nominate its remaining government member candidate and the list of participants in the local government. Chen said: "We are currently waiting for the arrival of the members of the Central Standing Committee of our party to convene a meeting in Nanjing before we can make a decision. It can be completed before the end of this month." The reporter also quoted the newly appointed executive member of the Executive Yuan, Chang Nai, as saying that the issue of the Youth Party's government members and ministers taking office can only be decided after Li Huang arrives in Nanjing. The reason why the list was submitted as late as the morning of the 23rd was to solicit opinions widely. Regarding the issue of participating in local governments, the Youth Party decided to participate partially, starting from the provinces along the Yangtze River. For temporary organizations such as temporary provincial, municipal, and county assemblies, they still mainly participate with party quotas. Furthermore, the Youth Party has recently decided to officially begin public party activities in various regions.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the New Government</h3>
<p>The reorganized National Government Committee was established yesterday, and a grand ceremony was held in the auditorium of the National Government. Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairman Sun both attended and delivered speeches. Leaders of the Kuomintang and Youth Democratic parties, as well as social elites, gathered together to discuss the current practical political affairs. This is the first time since the establishment of the National Government twenty years ago. At the same time, the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, was also sworn into office yesterday. The candidates for the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan have all been approved by the National Government Committee and will all take office today. The political circles of the capital are suddenly filled with a bright and peaceful new atmosphere. Not only are the people of the whole country looking forward to governance, but also people all over the world who love peace and democracy are hoping that after this reorganization, the Chinese government can truly promote a new political style and complete all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government during this short transition period, opening up a broad road for China's democratic nation-building. Therefore, the reorganized new government bears a very heavy responsibility. Not only will the stability and chaos of China depend on whether the reorganized government can complete its mission, but also the rise and fall and honor and disgrace of the entire country will depend on whether the reorganized new government can be renewed with the people.</p>
<p>The current situation is actually the darkest period in our country's history. During the Anti-Japanese War, we were frustrated by military setbacks. But looking forward to the current prospects, we ultimately feel very optimistic. At this moment, the fruits of victory have already rotted away, and the dream of the four or five strong powers has also awakened. Looking at reality, the flames of war are permeating half of China. The people in the war-torn areas are, of course, directly subjected to the looting of civil strife. Even the people outside the war-torn areas are living in dire straits, constantly facing the threat of soaring prices, and everywhere are the dangerous signs of production shrinking and traffic obstruction. Everyone is aware of the daily non-existence of national affairs, and thus falls into a state of depression and despair. Before the convening of the National Assembly last year, we had always hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reopen peace talks and turn the internal conflict into a treasure as soon as possible. Later, we learned about the crux of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and we knew that if the Chinese Communist Party was obsessed with its own ways and refused to lay down its arms, then all peace talks would be meaningless. Therefore, we can only hope that the government will make greater efforts to give play to the spirit of "everything is within my power" and obtain the cooperation and understanding of other political parties and social elites other than the Chinese Communist Party, and move towards the road of democratic nation-building step by step. When the National Assembly formulated the constitution last year, the people of the whole country placed unlimited hopes on it, and the reason was also in this. Now that the constitution has been promulgated and the outline of democracy has been roughly determined, as long as we make full preparations in accordance with the procedures for implementing the constitution, we can embark on the right track of constitutional government. Therefore, the attention of the people of the country is focused on the work of preparing for the implementation of the constitution during the transition period. The Kuomintang has implemented political tutelage for 20 years, but has failed to complete the work of implementing the constitution. Although it is due to the successive internal and external troubles, it cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Moreover, the transition period is very short and fleeting, so we must cherish it especially. In the Kuomintang itself, it welcomes the leaders of other political parties to participate in the government and jointly bear the responsibility of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. In the whole country, the people hope that the government can expand the foundation of democracy, with the participation of various parties, and work together to effectively complete all the work of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, since the closing of the National Assembly, the people of the whole country have been looking forward to the reorganization of the government. Now, the reorganization of the government has finally been fully realized. But what exactly should the reorganized new government do? And how can it live up to the expectations of the people of the country? On the occasion of the establishment of the reorganized government, we would like to express what our ordinary people want to say in their hearts.</p>
<p>First is the stability of the country. The people's demand for the government is not simple, in a word, it is the stability of the country. However, under the current circumstances, it is indeed a very difficult task to achieve the stability of the country. This demand for stability includes political stability and economic stability. As far as the former is concerned, if the problem of the Communist Party cannot be resolved, there is no hope of stopping the war. It is fundamentally impossible to seek the stability of the country. How can the problem of the Communist Party be resolved? The governing principles of the reorganized government also stipulate that political means should be adopted to resolve it, and it is said that negotiations will be held with the Communist Party as soon as railway traffic is restored. We believe that this is the only way out for our country's politics. Whether the reorganized new government can complete this governing principle is a major key to its success or failure. Regarding the latter, economic stability, it can be said that it is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. Some people say that political instability means that any good strategy or beautiful plan is useless. This statement certainly has considerable reasons, but it is also not a solution to push all the problems onto political problems and demand a general solution. May I ask, if the problem of the Communist Party is not resolved, can the economic problem never be resolved? We believe that human power can overcome nature. As long as the government dares to act and is willing to do something, and finds ways to contract the currency, balance the budget, increase production, and develop foreign trade, it is definitely not absolutely impossible to seek economic stability. Therefore, what we ordinary people hope for most from the reorganized government is that it can come up with a solution. It can no longer make our ordinary people struggle on the starvation line, otherwise singing loudly about democratic constitutionalism will be meaningless.</p>
<p>Second is the preparation for the implementation of the constitution. The biggest task undertaken by the government during the transition period is to fully prepare for the implementation of the constitution. I count on my fingers that there are only eight months from today to the day when the constitutional government begins, which is really too short. But how can we complete the work of preparing for the implementation of the constitution in these short eight months? The legislative procedure is extremely important, but it is not as good as the cultivation of democratic political style. The so-called democratic political style can be divided into two aspects. On the government side, it should fully demonstrate the new spirit of democratic politics. It should not only be enlightened, capable, courageous to take responsibility, and pay attention to administrative efficiency, but also have a broad-mindedness that can accept other people's criticisms. All administrative facilities should be based on public opinion. We should not plan for individuals, nor should we specialize in political parties, but we should always be able to take the interests of the entire country and nation and the people as the premise, and be able to take care of the overall situation in everything, and even be able to sacrifice the small ego to achieve the big ego. On the side of the people, we should also enthusiastically and humbly learn the use of democratic constitutionalism. On the one hand, we must have the tolerance to tolerate other people's opinions, and on the other hand, we must also have the spirit of abiding by the law. If everyone can have this basic spirit of tolerance and law-abiding, then the implementation of the constitution will definitely have good results, and it can truly make China's politics step into a new era of peace and democracy. Therefore, we ordinary people not only hope that the government has this new style, but also that we should take this initiative.</p>
<p>In short, from today onwards, the reorganized new government has begun to work. This is the starting point for our country's political innovation and democratization. The people of the whole country are full of hope. I only hope that Chinese politics will be reborn from today and open up a new path for China's democratic nation-building.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey Formally Passed by the Senate; Effective Upon House Approval</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 20th] President Truman's $400 million aid bill to Greece and Turkey for anti-communism, despite opponents denouncing it as a "declaration of war against the Soviet Union," was passed by the Senate today with a vote of 67 to 25. It now awaits final passage by the House of Representatives. The House is scheduled to begin debate next week. House leaders intend to limit the debate period so that it can be sent to President Truman for signature within the next week. According to Truman's warning, Britain can no longer afford military and economic aid to Greece and is withdrawing its troops from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean. If the United States does not provide assistance, strategic locations such as the Dardanelles Strait, Turkey, and the oil-rich fields of the Middle East will fall under communist control. It is said that this measure will authorize the President to provide military equipment, money, and military advisors to the governments of Greece and Turkey, but will not send troops. This move is a notification to the world that the United States is addressing the crisis in Greece and Turkey independently because the United Nations does not intend to handle this critical issue. However, its preamble states that the purpose of this plan is the same as the United Nations' mission to create peace. This aid measure includes an amendment stipulating that the United Nations Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly (without a veto) can stop it at any time by a majority vote, but it also stipulates that the United Nations will take over this task from the United States. The bill will provide military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey, with three hundred million dollars loaned to Greece and one hundred million dollars loaned to Turkey. President Truman will decide which of these will be repayable loans. At that time, the United States will send a limited number of military personnel to Greece and Turkey, but no troops will be sent. Economic delegations will also be sent to the two countries to supervise the distribution of American relief supplies and guide the economic policies of the Greek and Turkish governments.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Vandenberg delivered a speech today before the House vote, urging Democratic and Republican members to face the issue that the Communist Party has invaded the South China Sea from the Baltic Sea, which no one can deny us. President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey only represents the President's policy, and claims that this move constitutes American interference in the Balkans or a declaration of war against the Soviet Union are not factual. We should support the policy adopted by the President.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The "crusade" led by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace against Truman's policies in the United States and European countries has had some impact on the U.S. Senate's vote on the aid plan to Turkey and Greece. At least two influential senators, Democratic Senator Pepper of Florida and Democratic Senator Taylor of Idaho, voted against the plan. Observers today said that the small but highly active idealist faction to which Pepper and Taylor belong is expected to be even larger in the House of Representatives. No matter how weak this minority group's actions may be, they will likely increase Republican opposition to the Democratic government when the government requests continued funding. It is reported that President Truman and his advisors believe that the aid the United States should provide to Greece and Turkey is only the beginning stage, and the broader and more universal nature of the Truman Doctrine remains to be seen. According to reliable sources in the American diplomatic community, the White House is holding secret meetings and will not make a firm decision before Secretary of State Marshall returns from Moscow. Secretary of State Marshall will determine the intentions of the Soviet Union and then decide on the important issues of U.S.-Soviet relations, which may be resolved in the near future. It is also said that when the aid bill for Turkey and Greece becomes law in late May or early June, the U.S. government will likely decide on a strategy to present to Congress to expand the scope of the Truman Doctrine.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Wilson will travel to Turkey on the evening of the 25th with Robert Loeblein, Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Office of the State Department, to negotiate the U.S. supplying Turkey with $100 million worth of surplus military materials to help reorganize its army.</p>
<h3>Upon Government Invitation, Greek Foreign Minister Visits France; Bilateral Relations Become Closer</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 22nd] It was officially announced that Turkish Minister to Greece Ünaltin has invited Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris to Ankara for a visit. On the other hand, Greek Naval Minister Veni-zelos has invited the Turkish fleet to visit Greek ports. In addition, Greece and Turkey will soon hold negotiations aimed at determining a common agricultural policy to avoid competition in the production of grapes, figs, and tobacco, and to reduce their prices. According to a morning announcement by the Greek Army Headquarters, an area of 4,000 square kilometers in central Thessaly has been completely controlled by government forces. Guerrillas in the area have either been captured or fled, with 346 guerrillas killed and 294 captured. A large number of guerrillas have surrendered voluntarily. The Greek Army and gendarmerie suffered 30 deaths and 74 injuries. The Greek Army will pursue its victory and will not give the guerrillas a chance to regain their strength.</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister Grateful to the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 23rd] Greek Prime Minister Maximos told the Parliament today that in order to show that they are worthy of receiving American aid, the following two things must be done: (1) Suppress the rebellion as soon as possible; (2) Eliminate anti-democratic forces from any other sources. American aid to Greece indicates that we bear a greater responsibility for the nation and the democracy advocated by President Truman. He believed that the Parliament would pass a large-scale austerity plan to ensure that every dollar of the American people's generous assistance is used for the intended purpose of the loan.</p>
<h3>Acheson Clarifies Stance on Suspension of Soviet Cargo Shipments</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: Since Senator Vandenberg suggested suspending cargo shipments to the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union settles the $11 billion Lend-Lease debt, various parties have paid close attention to the State Department's attitude. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson specifically addressed this issue at a press conference, stating that the State Department's position has never changed, that the $17 million worth of post-war Lend-Lease materials that the United States allowed to be shipped to the Soviet Union should still be shipped according to the original plan.</p>
<p>After President Truman announced the aid plan for Greece and Turkey on March 12, both houses of Congress paid great attention. The image shows Acting Secretary of State Acheson answering questions from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (Special photo provided by the New York Times for this newspaper)</p>
<h3>U.S. House Passes Bill Indicting Communist Party Secretary General</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Amid calls for strong measures against the Communist Party, the House of Representatives today passed a bill indicting Communist Party Secretary General Dennis and New York lawyer Josephson for contempt of court.</p>
<h3>McKellar Requests Marshall Return to the Country Quickly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The Senate continued to discuss the aid plan for Greece and Turkey proposed by President Truman today. Democratic Senator McKellar stated that President Truman should cable Secretary of State Marshall to return from Moscow. He also said that the Soviet Union opposes all peace agreements. In my humble opinion, it is a great mistake for President Truman to keep Secretary of State Marshall in Moscow for so long.</p>
<h3>Wallace Broadcasts in France Advocating U.S. Loans to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace, after arriving here today, broadcasted on French radio, advocating non-political loans to the Soviet Union from the United States through some agency of the United Nations. Wallace said that in order to safeguard lasting peace, one agency of the United Nations must take care of the Soviet Union's vast disaster areas, not only those caused by the war but also those caused by repeated droughts. The Soviet Union, due to its poverty, has to demand huge amounts of industrial production as reparations from Germany, which will increase Germany's suffering and ultimately create instability in Europe. Therefore, I advocate that the United States give the Soviet Union non-political loans so that the Soviet Union can restore its industrial production. I hope that the United States can use its great power through the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Arab Countries Suggest Palestine Should Be Independent</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to convene a special session on the 28th of this month to discuss the Palestine issue. The Arab side is taking a unified stance. Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are following Egypt in requesting that the agenda of the General Assembly be expanded to immediately discuss ending the League of Nations' mandate over Palestine and establishing an independent state. The Jewish side has experienced internal strife. The unofficial organization, the Hebrew National Liberation Committee, today requested that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie allow the committee to send representatives to attend. The official Jewish organization, the Zionist Organization Committee, refuted this, stating that the Hebrew Committee has no right to serve as an official representative.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to convene a special session next Monday to discuss the Palestine issue. First, there is a dispute over the selection of candidates for the organization of an investigation committee. All five Arab countries of the United Nations request to be represented on the committee. Jewish groups object, believing that Arab countries and Britain should not be represented, and that the Jewish side should also have representatives participate. Britain argues that the Jewish groups, Arab countries, and Britain are all "parties involved" and should not participate in the committee, as this would hinder the work of the committee.</p>
<p>The Holy Land Is Still Unsettled; Retaliation Actions Arise Again</p>
<p>[United Press International, Jerusalem, 22nd] A fast train was derailed by a landmine today about twenty miles southeast of Tel Aviv, killing eight people and injuring one hundred and fifty. British troops have tightened security in the vicinity afterward. It is reported that the case was a retaliatory action by Jewish underground organizations for the British execution of terrorists.</p>
<h3>Whether an Agreement on the Austrian Treaty Can Be Reached Depends on Whether the Soviet Union Makes Concessions; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Is About to Adjourn</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcast: According to U.S. officials, the hope of completing the Austrian treaty at the Moscow Conference has almost disappeared. The last meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference may be held today or tomorrow. Delegations are currently packing their bags, preparing to return home three or four days after the conference closes. It is reported that the French delegation is scheduled to return by special train after the last meeting. Marshall and most of the American delegation plan to fly back to the United States by special plane.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 23rd] Today, the fate of the Austrian treaty rests on the Kremlin. The British and American delegation leaders here, who are quite anxious about the Austrian treaty, cannot predict whether the treaty can be completed. They unanimously acknowledged that this matter is quite difficult. The French delegation, due to the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize France's integration of Saar into its economic system, already believes that the conference is a thing of the past and continues its preparations to end tonight. However, the British and American sides are more inclined to set tomorrow as the earliest possible date for adjournment. Because the four foreign ministers have spent a lot of time in secret negotiations in recent days, there still seems to be a glimmer of hope for the completion of the Austrian treaty.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] The four foreign ministers held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the Trieste issue for an hour. Then, at the suggestion of Secretary of State Marshall, a secret meeting began at 6:10 to discuss the disputed points in the Austrian treaty and adjourned at 7:00 PM. It is reported that the four foreign ministers were slightly closer to agreement on the Austrian border issue during yesterday's secret meeting, but no new compromises were reached during the two secret meetings this morning and afternoon. The four foreign ministers met this morning to continue discussing the financial situation of the Free Territory of Trieste for fifteen minutes. The four powers unanimously agreed to accept the report submitted by the special investigation committee and decided that the Governor of the Territory and its legislative and administrative organs should find ways to balance it, which is tantamount to recognizing the economic independence of the Territory. At 11:45 PM, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed holding a secret meeting in an attempt to end the discussion of the Austrian issue, but it is reported that no positive results were achieved. In addition, the Foreign Ministers' Conference also ordered the four Deputy Foreign Ministers to discuss the German issue tomorrow morning, compile a statistical table of the opinions of various countries, and submit it to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion tomorrow afternoon. However, according to observers, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will not discuss the German issue in detail.</p>
<h3>Nazi Buried Treasure</h3>
<p>Found in a Monastery in Poland</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] A treasure buried by the Nazis was recently discovered in a monastery near Breslau, consisting of three tons of coins, gold, and diamonds, estimated at approximately £15 million.</p>
<h3>Bevin Extends Departure from Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 22nd] A Foreign Office spokesperson announced that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may extend his departure from Moscow by at least one day. Bevin was originally scheduled to leave the Soviet Union on Wednesday, but he may not be able to leave until Thursday.</p>
<h3>French Delegation Scheduled to Return Home Tonight</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] It is reported that the French delegation is scheduled to depart on a special train on the evening of the 24th of this month to return home. In addition, the representatives of the Southern countries expressed dissatisfaction with the four foreign ministers' conference's discussion of their demands, but expressed gratitude for the support of the French delegation for their demands.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives General Election Tomorrow; Conservatives Expected to Win; The Current Cabinet Will Resign Upon the Establishment of the New Parliament</h3>
<p>[International Intelligence Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The general election for members of the Japanese House of Representatives is scheduled for the 25th of this month. The Japanese House of Representatives was established in 1925. This is the 23rd general election, and the second general election after the defeat of Japan in the war and the election in April last year. However, this general election coincides with the imminent implementation of the new constitution, which is of profound significance in the history of Japanese constitutional government and is the only vanguard for the future of Japanese democratization. In order to ensure the high success of this general election, MacArthur Headquarters has continuously promoted the importance of the mission of the House of Representatives in the future, in order to prevent voters from forgoing their rights and to warn against blind voting. According to informed sources here, the conservatives may achieve the greatest success in this general election. The Liberal, Democratic, and Socialist parties are currently pouring all their efforts into campaigning. It is generally predicted that the Liberal Party is expected to win about 150 seats, the Democratic Party about 120 seats, the Socialist Party 120 seats, the Cooperative Party 40 seats, the Communist Party 5 seats, and the rest will belong to various small factions and independent individuals.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch] Japan is busy preparing for the highly important election of members of the House of Representatives to be held on the 25th. It is expected that Prime Minister Yoshida and his cabinet will resign en masse around mid-May to prepare for the establishment of the new parliament. According to Japanese government officials, the new parliament will be convened around May 10 or 11, and the cabinet will resign afterward. The new constitution stipulates that the cabinet should resign en masse when the parliament is established after the election. Therefore, the resignation of Yoshida and his cabinet has been stipulated by the new constitution.</p>
<h3>Results of the Japanese House of Councillors Election</h3>

<h3>Soviet Chief of Staff to Visit Britain</h3>

<h3>Stettinius in London</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Stettinius, a candidate for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination in 1948, arrived here last night from Norway and plans to discuss post-war issues with British cabinet members in a private capacity.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>Has Begun in Moscow</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations began tonight. The Soviet Union's emphasis on these negotiations can be evidenced by the fact that the Soviet delegation is personally led by Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan. Other Soviet negotiators include Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Menshikov and the head of the Soviet trade delegation to Britain, Krandrov. According to British chief representative, Minister of Foreign Trade Wilson, "We submitted a list of goods we hope to obtain from the Soviet Union last October, mainly timber and timber products such as pulp, as well as food. What the Soviet Union hopes to obtain, in addition to sawing machinery, includes light steel rails for transporting timber and £500,000 worth of electrical equipment. Mr. Branford, a representative of the British General Electric Company, has already received a solid proposal from the Soviet government last December to purchase a large number of generators from Britain. In addition, the Soviet Union also hopes to obtain some British food such as herring."</p>

<h3>Reducing Tariff Barriers Through Bilateral Negotiations; Sino-French Negotiations to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] It was announced here that the representatives of China and France to the International Trade Conference will begin negotiations on mutual tariff reductions on Friday, at which time they will exchange lists of import goods for which tariff concessions are prepared. In addition, similar negotiations between Britain and the United States, Canada and the United States, and Czechoslovakia and the United States are scheduled to begin tomorrow. Negotiations between France and the United States are scheduled to begin on Thursday, and negotiations between France and South Africa and Canada and France are also scheduled to begin on Friday. A total of one hundred and twenty tariff negotiation groups have been scheduled, with ninety-six having set dates, of which twenty-four will begin negotiations in April, forty-eight will begin negotiations in the first half of May, and twenty-four will begin negotiations in the second half of May. The Executive Committee of the International Trade Organization held a closed-door meeting today and elected several people, including Canadian Minister to Switzerland Wilgress, as vice-chairmen of the Planning Committee. The French representative also made a statement on France's new tariffs at this meeting. The US-French loan agreement of May 1946 first mentioned these new tariffs. At that time, the French side stated that although the new tax is individually stipulated for each item, the tax rate will not be higher than before the war, and that this new tax will be used as a basis for negotiations on reducing French tariffs in Geneva. However, according to European sources, France's new tax system will be 50 percent higher than the current tax rate. In the US-French loan agreement, France also stated that it will abolish the import restriction system after the new tax system is implemented.</p>

<h3>Between Lujiabang and Kunshan: Jinling Express Derails and Overturns; Eleven Injured Sent to Suzhou and Wuxi for Treatment; Track Repaired at Midnight, Traffic Disrupted for Nine Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Jinling Express, a through train with first and second-class carriages on the Shanghai-Nanjing line of the two railway bureaus, departing from Shanghai for Nanjing at 1:30 PM yesterday, derailed at 2:36 PM between Lujiabang and Kunshan, outside Xiyangqi village west of Xixiang Station. The last two carriages (FP503 and SP705) suddenly derailed and overturned on the south side of the track. Fortunately, the driver noticed the derailment and immediately applied the brakes, preventing damage to other carriages. One passenger in the overturned carriages, Chen Panming, was seriously injured, nine were slightly injured, and a car attendant, Tao Zengrong, also sustained injuries. Personnel from Xixiang Station provided immediate assistance and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Bureau. Deputy Director Hou Huohua, Transportation Director Guan Duo, and Engineering Director Mei Fuqiang, along with engineering and medical personnel, rushed to the scene on a rescue train to provide assistance and carry out repairs.</p>
<p>The front portion of the Jinling Express, the carriages that had not derailed, continued onward at 3:57 PM. All injured passengers were transported on the train to Suzhou Hospital for treatment, while the remaining two hundred-plus uninjured passengers continued their journey to Nanjing on the original train. After the incident, our reporter boarded the bureau's rescue train to inspect the scene. Track workers were diligently replacing sleepers and steel rails. The overturned carriages had their windows completely destroyed, and the sofa furnishings were in complete disarray, yet many of the passengers' glass teacups remained intact. The passenger car was only a foot away from the track. At 8:30 PM, cranes were used to lift the overturned carriages, and the tracks were repaired. By 11:30 PM, all train services were able to resume, meaning that traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line had been disrupted for a total of nine hours. Upon inspection, 38 steel rails were damaged, and over 300 sleepers were broken. The bureau's responsible personnel are currently conducting detailed investigations and studies based on reports from various sources to determine the cause of the accident. A meeting on the incident is scheduled for this afternoon. Until a conclusion is reached, no statement will be issued. Upon hearing the news, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei in Nanjing expressed great concern and immediately telegraphed Bureau Director Chen Bozhuang to visit the injured passengers at the hospital. Due to Chen's busy schedule, Deputy Director Hou Huohua was asked to represent him and visit the Suzhou and Wuxi hospitals last night.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Four people were seriously injured in the derailment, three passengers and one car attendant. One passenger, Chen Panming, suffered a fractured skull with a large hole. Another, Zhang Bingfu, sustained severe spinal and chest injuries and is unable to walk or sit. He is currently being treated at the Puren Hospital in Wuxi. It is reported that Zhang is the owner of the Nanyang Hotel in Xinan. The third passenger suffered severe injuries to his chest and shoulders and is in critical condition. The car attendant, Tao Zengrong, suffered a broken nose, with a T-shaped fracture and three bone fractures.</p>
<p>According to passengers on the derailed Jinling Express, the number of injuries was limited because the carriage doors and windows were tightly closed due to the cold weather. Otherwise, passengers would have been thrown out of the doors and windows with no chance of survival. It was also said that the FP503 first-class carriage was newly shipped from the United States, and the ratio between the wheels and the tracks may not have been up to standard, causing the derailment. The glass windows on the carriages were very large and thick, costing over four million yuan each, and many were shattered.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Suzhou, 23rd] As the Jinling Express from Shanghai approached Xixiang, four or five kilometers from Kunshan Station, the last two carriages suddenly overturned. Due to the distance, the locomotive was unable to detect the derailment in time and continued for about one kilometer before stopping. Two passengers were seriously injured, and four were slightly injured. They have been sent to hospitals in Kunshan and Suzhou for treatment. The cause of the derailment is attributed to the American-style wheels not being fully compatible with the existing tracks, resulting in a risk of vibration and overturning at slightly higher speeds.</p>

<h3>Arms Smuggling Organization Uncovered in West Shanghai; Six Arrested; Arms Dealer Conspired with US Navy Soldiers to Steal and Sell; Confessed to Purchasing on Orders from Haimen County Government</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Regarding rumors of a terrorist organization preparing a conspiracy to riot and sell arms being uncovered by the Garrison Headquarters in West Shanghai, a responsible person from the Garrison Headquarters stated yesterday that the case was actually an ordinary case of stolen arms and did not involve a terrorist organization with booby traps, etc. However, the case involves the US Navy stationed in Shanghai and the Haimen County Government. Recently, there have been frequent reports of arms being stolen from the US Navy in this city. After a secret investigation, several soldiers were found to be involved in theft. According to their confessions, they colluded with Chinese arms brokers to steal and sell the arms. The US Navy authorities requested the assistance of the Garrison Headquarters to solve the case. The Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, together with US personnel, conducted investigations for several days and learned that the arms dealer who colluded with the US Navy was living in Gongmaoli, Zhangjiazhai in West Shanghai. So a search was made there a few days ago, and eight light machine guns and six rifles were found on the scene. Six people were arrested. After sending the people and the stolen goods to the headquarters for interrogation, in addition to the main offender admitting to colluding in the theft and sale of arms, several others confessed that they were ordered by the Haimen County Government to purchase guns and ammunition in Shanghai for use by the local self-defense corps, and they had certificates from the Haimen County Government as proof. The Garrison Headquarters has already telegraphed the Haimen County Government to inquire whether this is true. The headquarters believes that even if the offenders were ordered to come to Shanghai to buy guns and ammunition, they did not contact the military and police authorities in advance and proceeded secretly on their own, which is inappropriate. Therefore, all the offenders were sent to the military court for trial last night in accordance with the law. As for the names of the offenders and the details of the case, the Inspection Department has not yet agreed to disclose them yesterday.</p>

<h3>200 Mu of Land Encircled in Zhabei to Be Opened Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] In the north of Hengfeng Bridge in Zhabei, this city, there are two pieces of vacant land with an area of about 200 mu. They were originally encircled during the enemy and puppet period. In order to benefit the citizens, Wang, the chief of Zhabei District, specially requested the military authorities to open the vacant land, and he has been approved by You Nuo. It will be opened in the shortest possible time. However, in order to prevent unscrupulous citizens from arbitrarily occupying or privately building shacks, in addition to organizing a committee to handle the matter, District Chief Wang, accompanied by Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, went to inspect the land. After the inspection, Director Zhao said that he would formulate specific measures and submit them to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Ferry Service Between Dongchang Road and Dongmen Road; Crowding Easily Leads to Accidents; Citizens Call for Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] City Councilors Zhao Yangxiong and Cao Jun, recently received a request from Pudong citizens to forward a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Ferry Company to improve the ferry situation, and specially requested the authorities to handle it quickly on their behalf. It is said that the ferry line across the river between Dongchang Road and Dongmen Road in Pudong has always had two ferries, Nos. 25 and 23, and a special ferry, No. 26, is also opened in the morning and evening, and the order is good. In late last month, the No. 26 ferry was damaged, and the special ferry service was discontinued. As a result, there are too many passengers in the morning and evening, and they are extremely crowded. When the ferry is docked, the order is greatly disrupted, and the old and weak suffer from it. Crying and shouting, scratched skin, and torn clothes are often seen. Moreover, each ship carries more than 500 passengers. When crowded, people often stand dangerously outside the railing. If the ship tilts, they may easily lose their footing. At about 5:00 PM on the 12th of this month, a passenger fell into the river, but was fortunately rescued and escaped disaster. Subsequently, the bureau regularly transferred the No. 25 ferry back for repair, and replaced it with the Changdu ferry Huhai. However, although the ship is large, the equipment is not suitable, and short-distance passengers feel even more inconvenient, and the crowding and chaos are the same as before. Therefore, a letter is specially sent to the company authorities to try to rent appropriate ferries to replace the Nos. 25 and 26 ferries before they are repaired, and to send special ferries during the crowded ferry times in the morning and evening to accommodate passengers, so as to benefit the people's travel.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Financial Organizations to Assist Agricultural Production</h3>
<p>Chen Guofu's Speech at a Welcome Dinner</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Treasury, recently came to Shanghai. Financial figures in this city held a joint tea party at the conference hall on the fourth floor of the Bank of China yesterday afternoon to welcome him. Fang, the chairman of the committee, was elected to preside over the meeting and gave a brief welcome speech. Then, Mr. Chen was invited to express his opinions on the financial community in the future. The main points were roughly as follows: For the sake of coordinating with the national policy, the financial cause of our country should strive to assist the development of the production cause, and should especially take the effort to assist agricultural production as the guiding principle for the financial community to carry out its business in the future. The Farmers Bank of China should first promote the work of assisting agricultural finance. Secondly, the Central Cooperative Treasury should do its best to assist the development of cooperative undertakings throughout the country. At the same time, Shanghai's consumer cooperatives should cooperate with inland production cooperatives to enhance efficiency. We should study the current financial problems more in order to make progress. At the same time, we should absorb outstanding people, strengthen the organization of the financial community, and reform the atmosphere, so as to be a model for society.</p>

Since its implementation, excellent results have been achieved, with approximately 6,000 people being vaccinated daily. Starting today, military police will assist in inspections.

<h3>Morphine Seized on the Cai E Steamer; Female Passenger Conspired with Cook to Smuggle; Value Exceeds 300 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Shen Deting and Chen Jingshan, the director and deputy director of the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau, are very active in investigating and prohibiting opium and other drugs. Recently, Zhou, the section chief of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Cai E steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at about 9:00 AM on the 12th, learned that there were narcotics on board. He immediately led Inspector Gu Yaoshen, Police Chief Sun Ziqiang, and police officers Li Jiafu, Wang Jinghua, Hu Qujiu, and Chen Xianfa to depart at about 8:00 AM and went to the Third Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on East Zhongshan Second Road to lay in ambush around. After the steamer docked at the wharf, they immediately inspected the luggage and suitcases of each passenger. In the luggage of a female passenger named Bao Yue'e and Wu Suqing, a small yellow suitcase was opened and three large packages of morphine were discovered. Soon after, two young women, Weng Beishi and Wu Dongshi, carried biscuit boxes and pickled radish baskets. After inspection, five more large packages of morphine were found. According to Weng Beishi and others, the head cook Wang Rongzhang and cook Wang Huating on the steamer were responsible for keeping them in custody along the way. The narcotics were entrusted to them by Wang Yangshi in Tianjin and instructed to bring them to Shanghai and then call Yuan A'fa at 724 Guangdong Road to pick up the goods. The telephone number was 97668, etc. Then, Section Chief Zhou arrested the head cook Wang Rongzhang and cook Wang Huating on the ship. He then went to the front building of 724 Guangdong Road together with personnel from the Laozha Police Station to arrest Yuan A'fa, but he was not found. According to people, Yuan returned to his hometown to sweep tombs more than ten days ago and has not yet returned. After interrogating the other offenders at the police station, Bao Yue'e confessed that the narcotics she was carrying were entrusted to her by Zhang Rongsheng in Tianjin and asked her to bring them to Shanghai first. Zhang would arrive after work. Wu Dongshi confessed that the principal offender, Wang Yangshi, would come to Shanghai by steamer recently. After receiving the confessions, the sub-bureau ordered police officers to wait and search each Tianjin steamer arriving in Shanghai, but to no avail. The sub-bureau intends to send the eight large packages of morphine seized, weighing a total of 77 taels and 4 mace, worth more than 300 million yuan, together with the suspects to the court. The search for the principal offender who is still at large is still underway. According to Shen Deting, the director of the sub-bureau, the police officers have solved more than 30 opium and drug cases in the past month, and have spared no effort in searching all steamers arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Heroic Resistance to the Enemy Will Never Die; Sixth Anniversary of Xie Jinyuan's Death; Commemorative Ceremony at the Tomb Today</h3>
<p>Today is the sixth anniversary of the death of Xie Jinyuan, the late commander of the Eight Hundred Heroes. Xie led the Eight Hundred Heroes to defend Sihang Warehouse. The spirit of their heroic resistance to the enemy and the tragic encounter of their death in the Lone Army Camp still linger in the minds of residents of the city, and they sigh with emotion. It is reported that Xie's widow, Ling Weicheng, will hold a grand commemorative ceremony at Xie Gong's Mausoleum on Jiaozhou Road at 10:00 AM to show that she will continue to fulfill Xie Gong's legacy and carry forward the great spirit of Chinese soldiers.

The Xie Jinyuan Middle School Boy Scout Band will play music.</p>
<h3>Labor Circles Demand Adjustment of the Index; Resolutely Crack Down on Speculators; Shui Xiangyun Talks About Past Price Increases Unrelated to the Index</h3>
<p>Since the government implemented the Economic Emergency Plan and froze the workers' cost-of-living index, prices were stable for a while, but recently they have fluctuated and risen again. The laborers in this city are quite anxious because their livelihoods are affected, and various labor unions are gradually demanding an adjustment of the index. A reporter from Dagong News Agency specially visited Shui Xiangyun, the chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, yesterday to inquire about his thoughts on this matter. According to him, when the authorities announced the workers' cost-of-living index, taking the wages of January as the standard, he immediately expressed that prices should also be frozen from January, and requested the allocation of physical goods in the same quantity as public and private school teachers. Later, Mayor Wu and Director Wu strongly argued with the central government and obtained six items of in-kind difference funds. This was slightly better than the original plan, but it was still 48 items less than the original cost-of-living index. The city's labor representatives proposed at the general meeting to unfreeze the cost-of-living index, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also had a proposal to adjust the cost-of-living index every three months, but the Standing Committee believed that the Economic Emergency Plan had not been announced for a long time, and prices were not stable, so in order to maintain the central government's decrees, it temporarily did not change, and the workers also understood the country's economic crisis and temporarily endured the pain and accepted it. Up to now, three months later, prices have not decreased slightly, but have risen instead. Daily necessities such as rice, oil, cloth, and vegetables have risen even more sharply. Under such circumstances, it is really difficult for workers to maintain their true livelihoods. At that time, the government still thought that the rise in prices was due to the index. In fact, the index originally arose from prices. First there were prices, then there was the index. The index would never lead to rising prices. The fact that prices have continued to rise after the index was frozen this time is clear evidence. As a result, the hardworking workers have suffered significant sacrifices at this time. Therefore, the Federation of Trade Unions has only two requests to the government under such circumstances: (1) Please adjust the index. (2) Please crack down on speculators' speculation and monopoly in order to stabilize prices and stabilize workers' lives. Otherwise, labor-capital disputes in the industry will continue to rise and fall, affecting the stability of the entire society.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement in Seawall Project; Investigation Reveals It Was a Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] In order to thoroughly investigate the seawall project embezzlement case, the Public Works Bureau, based on the accusation of the people's representatives of the third protection zone of Gaoqiao, said that Yang Yilang, the contractor of the seawall project team, misappropriated the original seawall stones as purchased new stone materials. Three senior officials were sent to inspect the site on the 10th of this month, and the district chief of the district, Zhong Yuliang, and the chairman of the people's representative assembly, Cui Zhiming and Huang Mengyan, were invited to investigate together. Cui and Huang were unable to participate due to other business. The three senior officials of the Public Works Bureau and the team leader of the engineering team, Xu Juansong, and the contractor, Yang Yilang, went to the two places for inspection. The results of the investigation were announced by the Public Works Bureau yesterday as follows: (1) The project section is the third engineering team, not under the jurisdiction of the fourth engineering team. (2) District Chief Zhong and Cui Zhiming claimed that the number of seawall stones moved was tens of millions of tons, which was not true. Only more than 600 cubic meters were moved, which is equivalent to more than 940 tons. (3) According to the contract, the cost of retrieving stones scattered far away is 3,000 yuan per cubic meter, the cost of loading and unloading trucks is 2,000 yuan per cubic meter, and the cost of paving is 6,000 yuan per cubic meter, totaling 11,000 yuan per cubic meter. The stone materials are not priced, and the transportation truck is allocated by the management team of the engineering team, and no transportation fee is listed separately. (4) The section of stone retrieval is consistent with the survey. Because there is a shallow sand beach outside the row piles in that section, it is easy to retrieve, and there is absolutely no such thing as dismantling the seawall.</p>
<p>On the 21st of this month, a staff member of the Public Works Bureau went to Gaoqiao again to meet with Cui and Huang. According to them, they said that they were unable to go together because they were busy with meetings. As for the engineering team moving stones, because they had not seen a report in advance, and the local people did not want to move the stones from place A to place B. Based on the above points, it can be seen that perhaps the local residents only saw trucks transporting stones, and suspected that there was corruption, resulting in a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Su Chengde Still Attempts to Evade Death; Application for Retrial in High Court Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Su Chengde, who once served as the puppet capital's police chief and deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was sentenced to death by the High Court. Su appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial, but his appeal was rejected. In order to save his last fate, Su applied to the original trial court (High Court) for a retrial in accordance with Article 413 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The High Court rejected his application on the grounds that he did not present any favorable new evidence in his application. The ruling was sent to Su yesterday. It is reported that within three days, he will appeal to the directly superior court (Supreme Court) in accordance with Article 395 of the Criminal Procedure Law. If the appeal is rejected again, Su will have no way to escape his death. The execution of Liang Hongzhi and Chang Yuqing did not complete the "application for retrial" and "appeal" procedures, so they were still resentful when they were dying. Su has gone through this complete legal procedure, so he can die with peace of mind when he is executed in the future.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian Sent Back for Retrial</h3>
<p>Zheng Hongnian, the president of the puppet Central China Railway Co., Ltd., was previously sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court. Zheng did not accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The Supreme Court ruled, "The original judgment is revoked," and the case was sent back to the High Court for a retrial. The reasons for the judgment are roughly as follows: According to the defendant's confession, during his tenure in the puppet government, he rescued 48 underground workers, including Tao Xiaojie. The original trial did not fully investigate this favorable evidence. Moreover, after the defendant served as the president of the puppet Central China Railway Co., Ltd. on January 6, 1944, all his power was controlled by the Japanese deputy president. He only worked two hours a week. During his one-year tenure in the puppet government, he reviewed no more than 40 documents. According to the provisions of Article 59 of the Criminal Law, "If the circumstances of the crime are pitiful, the sentence may be appropriately reduced." The original judgment's sentence was a bit too heavy. The defendant's application for retrial is not unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Black Nose Ah Da and Others Sentenced to Two and a Half Years Each</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The High Court pronounced judgments on three cases of suspected traitors yesterday morning: (1) Xie Demao, the manager of Jiu Da Xie Ji Copper and Tin Co. Ltd. on Linsen Middle Road, was accused of purchasing military raw materials such as copper coins and lead for the enemy. (2) Wang Zhisan, the publisher of the Da Xue Yan Shi Le, was accused of opening a joint alcohol factory during the enemy and puppet period to supply the enemy with alcohol. (3) Li Ah Da, nicknamed "Black Nose Ah Da," was accused of serving as a puppet military officer. In all three cases, the defendants were sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for two years, and their property was confiscated, with the exception of the necessary living expenses for their families.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Zheng Jingzong; Still Suspected of Being Killed by His Landlord</h3>
<p>Shao Kunshan's Non-Prosecution Disposition; Deceased's Family Displeased and Requests Reconsideration</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Zheng Jingzong, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner living at No. 12 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, went out at noon on March 21 and did not return. The next day, his body was found floating in the Huangpu River. Zheng Liangshi, the deceased's wife, filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate, accusing the landlord, Shao Kunshan, of murdering her husband. From last September to this spring, Shao Kunshan had forced Zheng Jingzong to move out. In March of this year, Shao's actions became more active. He had forced Zheng to go out for "tea talks" on the 15th of the month. On the 19th, Shao Kunshan's wife slapped Zheng Jingzong, blocked the gate, obstructed Zheng's freedom, and did not allow patients to enter for treatment. Fang Zheng, the prosecutor in charge of the case, summoned the co-tenants for questioning, proving the above facts, and therefore filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 304, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. However, regarding the suspicion of murder, the autopsy results confirmed that he had drowned and there was no trace of being murdered before being thrown into the water. The scars on the body may have been abrasions after entering the water. It was considered that the defendant, Shao Kunshan, was suspected of murdering the deceased, so he was given a non-prosecution disposition. Zheng Jingzong's family members were dissatisfied with the punishment received by the defendant and filed a request with the High Procuratorate for reconsideration yesterday.</p>
<h3>Huang Mian's Tragic Death Under a Car; His Wife Demands Compensation</h3>
<p>Huang Mian, a section chief of the Jiangsu District Commodity Tax Bureau, came to Shanghai on official business last month. On the 15th of the month, he was crushed to death by a No. 22 red public bus at the intersection of Zhongzheng Middle Road and Lianyun Road. Huang's wife, Wu Meizhen, requested the help of the Guangdong Dapu Fellow Villagers Association to seek justice. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Dapu Fellow Villagers Association received reporters at the association in Laoximen and reported the details of the accident. Huang Jun left behind a 73-year-old mother, as well as a wife and two sons and one daughter. Although Huang's wife repeatedly negotiated with the French Concession Bus Company, demanding compensation for damages in accordance with the law, so that the deceased could be buried and the living could be supported, the company has not paid attention to it, or only offered a very small amount of charitable relief funds, deliberately delaying the matter. According to Huang's wife, the French Concession Bus Company is irresponsible and bullies the weak, which she is not willing to accept. Huang Jun is a national civil servant, so his salary is meager. The medical expenses and funeral expenses this time were borrowed from friends. In the future, funeral and living expenses will have no source. She has submitted a request to the company for living expenses, children's education expenses, mental consolation money, funeral expenses, etc. The company is only willing to donate 10 million yuan, so she asks people from all walks of life to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Hold Publicly Funded Overseas Student Examinations This Year with a Quota of 300 Students; Application for Funds Submitted to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Ministry of Education, recognizing the acute shortage of talent in various fields in China, believes that, in addition to strengthening domestic universities and research institutions to cultivate talent, sending students abroad to absorb new knowledge is particularly important. Before the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education placed great emphasis on overseas education. During the War of Resistance, due to funding and transportation constraints, the Ministry of Education did not hold public examinations for overseas students, except for the examinations for research and internship students to the United States and the first self-funded overseas student examination. After the victory, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, all kinds of construction projects require the participation of specialized talent. Therefore, the Ministry held one examination each for publicly funded and self-funded overseas students in July last year. The original plan was to recruit 1,000 publicly funded students, but due to limited funding, this was reduced to 100, which was far from meeting the actual needs. The cultivation of talent in the future cannot be delayed. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's work plan for the 36th year still includes sending students abroad. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the Ministry of Education still plans to hold public examinations for overseas students this year. The quota was originally set at 500 students, but due to the announcement of economic measures and foreign exchange difficulties, it has been reduced to 300 students. The application has now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be prepared for implementation once approved.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Mayor's Cup Basketball Game - Group A Shantou Team vs. Columbus</h3>
<p>There were originally four Mayor's Cup basketball games tonight, held as usual at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 5:00 PM. As a finale, a rematch between the women's teams Xue Bai and Qing Lian has been added, bringing the total to five games. The schedule is listed below:</p>
<p>Zhong Xin vs. Lun Ju Si (Exhibition) - 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Sheng You vs. Meng Team (Youth) - 5:45 PM</p>
<p>Wen Hua vs. Lü Jie (Youth) - 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Shan Team vs. Columbus (Group A) - 7:15 PM</p>
<p>Xue Bai vs. Qing Lian (Women's) - 8:15 PM</p>
<p>In the three youth group games, Lun Ju Si vs. Zhong Xin is the first match. Because the former team's players exceeded the standard, it will be considered an exhibition and the score will not be counted.</p>
<p>In the Group A rematch, Columbus will face the Shantou team. The referees are Wu Zibin and Chen Baolin. Both sides are evenly matched. The Columbus team consists of elite American sailors, with height and strength, and excellent basketball skills, which have earned unanimous praise from both insiders and outsiders. The main players, Ash and Plori, are particularly dangerous. They recently defeated the strong Qingli Zhuang's Encas, showing their full potential and strong fighting power. The Shantou team has been in good shape recently, with great momentum. Last weekend, they lost to Hualian by only two points in the final for the League A championship, which proves their formidable strength. They will definitely do their best to fight for the finals against the American team. The outcome of the game is uncertain.

<h3>Roosevelt Cup Basketball Tournament - Chinese Team Representatives Selected</h3>

<h3>Possible Modifications to Track and Field Rules</h3>
<p>— Wu Bangwei</p>
<p>The track and field rules currently used in China are still those from 1936. It is unknown whether new rules can be obtained from the Olympic Games, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation revised the rules at a meeting in France in 1939 in preparation for the 12th World Games to be held in Finland in 1940. The changes were not significant. I think that at least these new rules should be adopted for the upcoming National Games. Therefore, I will first introduce the changes unofficially.</p>
<p>(1) The original starting command has been changed to "On Your Marks" and "Set". When using Mandarin, the two words "Yu Bei" (Ready) may be changed to one word.</p>
<p>(2) After calling "Set", the starter may fire the gun when he believes that the athletes have calmed down and are consistent. This is slightly different from the old rule of "pausing for about two seconds before firing the gun."</p>
<p>(3) After calling "Set" and before firing the gun, an athlete's hand or foot leaving the starting position will be considered a foul.</p>
<p>(4) Starting blocks may be used at the start. This is not intended to help athletes with equipment, but to protect the track and accelerate the race.</p>
<p>(5) In a staggered start race (such as 200 or 400 meters around a curve), the starter should stand in a suitable location so that the distance to each athlete is approximately equal.</p>
<p>(6) Anyone who uses stimulants to increase their physical ability during a competition will be permanently disqualified from participating in the competition.</p>
<p>(7) When the results of the high jump or pole vault are equal, the method of determining the ranking is as follows: To resolve the first place, a fourth jump should be made at the height at which they both failed. If they both clear it, the height is raised by two centimeters and they each jump once. If they both fail the fourth jump, the height is lowered to the last cleared height and they each jump once. If there is still no result, the height should continue to be increased or decreased until a ranking is determined.</p>
<p>(8) For field events that are measured by distance, if the results are equal, the ranking will be determined by the second-best result of each athlete with equal results. (If this rule is implemented, the result of each jump and throw of each athlete must be accurately measured and recorded for verification.)</p>
<p>(9) In high jump and pole vault, the referee should announce to the athletes the height that will be increased each time before the competition begins.</p>
<p>(10) In pole vault, if the athlete's pole touches the vertical plane of the top of the pole vault box, it will be considered a failure.</p>
<p>(11) New-style hurdles are required, so there is no disqualification for knocking down a hurdle, and the result can be officially recorded.</p>

<h3>Three Directives from the Executive Yuan to the Municipal Government - Strengthen Control of Gauze Supply - Implementation Method to be Determined After Chairman Wu Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government yesterday received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding the balanced supply and price stabilization of gauze, and decided on three measures: (1) The customs declaration for cotton yarn and cloth for re-export or railway transit must be approved by the Textile Industry Management Committee. (2) The Textile Industry Management Committee shall issue permits in accordance with the Provisional Management Measures for Gauze Shipped to South China and the Simplified Rules for Reviewing Categories A and B. (3) The Ministry of Economic Affairs shall instruct the China Textile Corporation to rush the delivery of gauze needed in the Northeast and Guangdong as soon as possible to ensure sufficient supply. Items 1 and 2 above will be implemented with immediate effect. The three ministries of Finance, Economy, and Transportation have been instructed to comply. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government notified the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday (23rd) to comply.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee, the Executive Yuan issued three measures to stabilize the price of gauze. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government received an urgent telegram and forwarded it to the committee. According to the content of the measures, the customs declaration for cotton yarn and cloth for re-export must be approved by the committee, which shows that the scope is very wide. And if it is handled in accordance with the management measures for the transport of gauze to the south, the monthly quota of gauze transported to major commercial ports across the country will need to be calculated, and the procedures will be very complicated. However, the committee is actively preparing, and once Chairman Wu returns to Shanghai, they will discuss the implementation method.</p>
<p>Gauze Market Situation is Uniformly Downstream</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, after the Executive Yuan issued three measures to stabilize the price of gauze, the Jianghai Customs and the North Station in the city received the instructions from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation, and exports were restricted, so the gauze market situation was uniformly downstream. Those holding goods rushed to sell them, while buyers dared not continue to enter the market. The market fell sharply in the morning, but people's hearts have stabilized in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Forecast of Cotton Yarn Purchase Price in April</p>
<p>According to Liu, the purchase price of cotton yarn in April has not been discussed by the Sixth District Cotton Textile Public Meeting Price Negotiation Group, so the Textile Management Committee has no basis for discussion, and there is no saying that 3.4 million yuan has been determined. The current cotton in Shanghai has been allocated. According to his estimation, if the cost of each load of cotton from the Industry and Commerce General Association is 650,000 yuan, then the purchase price of 20-count yarn in April should be above 4 million yuan. As for the yarn spun by each factory from cotton purchased on its own in addition to the cotton from the Industry and Commerce General Association and the limited import quota, it is not included in the purchase.</p>
<p>Letter from the Cotton Textile Public Association to the Textile Management Committee</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Machinery Cotton Textile Industry Association recently stated that the rising price of cotton has made it impossible to maintain the cost of the purchase price set by the Textile Management Committee, and has listed detailed figures in a letter to the Textile Management Committee, requesting comprehensive instructions for the textile industry to follow. The content of the original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"We respectfully report that since the 18th Committee meeting of your association on December 27th of last year resolved to stabilize yarn prices, each yarn factory has conscientiously implemented the policy of having the government purchase half of the cotton yarn produced since January 1st, 1947. However, soon after your association purchased cotton yarn to stabilize market prices, the market price of cotton yarn has risen from 2.2 million yuan per piece to more than 6 million yuan, and the price of cotton has risen from 300,000 yuan per load to 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The purchase price of yarn in January was 1,975,000 yuan per piece, which was only 200,000 yuan away from the market price. The purchase price of yarn in April has not yet been clearly indicated by your association, but there is a saying that it will be set at around 3.4 million yuan, which is more than 3 million yuan away from the market price. Proportionally speaking, the difference was only 10% at the beginning, but now it has reached 100%. The price of cotton and the price of yarn are becoming more and more decoupled.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the purchase, the price of cotton was 300,000 yuan per load, and the purchase price of cotton yarn was 1,975,000 yuan, a ratio of 1 to 6.6. Now the price of cotton is 1.5 million yuan. Assuming that the purchase price is still around 3.4 million yuan, the ratio is 1 to 2.3, a difference of two-thirds in proportion. In terms of the purpose of the purchase, it was originally to stabilize yarn prices. However, the instability of yarn prices remains the same, and the significance of the purchase has long been lost.</p>
<p>The distance between the market price and the purchase price is increasing day by day, and the evolution of the market is far beyond the original expectations. In particular, the market price of yarn and cotton cannot match. (If the purchase price is 3.4 million yuan, only 230 pounds of cotton can be purchased at the market price. According to the 350 pounds of raw cotton required per piece, there is a shortage of 120 pounds, and there is no way to pay for labor.) If the current situation is not thoroughly changed, the effect of stabilizing yarn prices will not be achieved, and yarn factories are already facing the situation of suspending work and closing down. Your association bears the mission of supervising the rational development of the national textile industry. At present, the textile industry is facing a critical moment of survival. We urge your association to provide comprehensive instructions to follow, which would be fortunate for the textile industry and fortunate for the national industry."</p>
<p>46 Households Resume Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>A total of 183 manufacturers whose allocation of yarn was temporarily suspended by the Textile Construction Company due to the fact that the amount applied for did not meet the actual production needs, have once again stated their reasons to the company's business department and submitted supplementary documents. After re-examination, it has been approved that the allocation will be resumed from yesterday (23rd) for 46 households. These include 23 knitting industries, 6 underwear industries, 5 towel and sheet industries, 10 handkerchief industries, and 2 canvas industries.</p>
<p>Four Cases of Illegal Business Operation Uncovered</p>
<p>The Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters has dispatched a large number of personnel to the yarn and cloth markets in recent days to investigate unscrupulous merchants and put pressure on them, and has achieved results. Yesterday, the black market price of Shuangma 20-count yarn plummeted by more than 1 million yuan from a high price of 6.8 million yuan per piece, and the price of cloth also fell by 30,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan per bolt, with a continuing downward trend. The group also announced yesterday that it had uncovered four cases of illegal gauze and cloth business operations: (1) Fuan Yarn Factory, located in the Salt Industry Building at 280 Beijing Road, sold 188 bales of cotton yarn on the black market from April 7th to April 15th, all exceeding the negotiated price, which is obviously illegal. The factory manager, Ni Baosheng, and the deputy manager, Du Yunzhan, have been summoned, and the case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (2) Shengxin Yarn Number at 249 Zhonghui Building, Zhengdong Road, falsified account books and hoarded 29 pieces of cotton yarn. The hoarded cotton yarn was confiscated. (3) Qinxing Yarn Number at 250 Zhonghui Building is a "side-job" yarn number that specializes in "passing the buck". There are no account books at all. The penalty is suspension of business. (4) Yongda Xiejihang on Xiaoshadu Road is a department store that uses the name of department stores to request the distribution of cloth and sells it on the black market. It was discovered by inspectors on the spot and has also been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Mediocre</h3>
<p>The public bonds were still very mediocre yesterday, first high and then low. Room 504 had offers, while Runde accepted them. Tong Bing opened at 14,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 14,000 yuan and a low of 12,600 yuan. It struggled around 13,000 yuan in the end. As a result, it fell by 1,200 yuan compared to the previous close. Categories A and B fell by 1,000 yuan. Category D was still flat, while Tong Wu fell by 1,300 yuan.

<h3>Four Types of Security Designated for US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 23rd] The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries recently held several meetings to discuss the issue of security for US dollar bonds. It is reported that it has been decided to use the following four categories as security: (1) The wharves and warehouses received nationwide, (2) The real estate received nationwide, (3) The stocks invested by the central government in companies such as Shanghai Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, (4) China Textile Corporation. It is reported that the total value of the above four categories exceeds 5 trillion yuan. If the Supervisory Committee finds that the amount is insufficient during the review, it can continue to allocate funds. The detailed list is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other agencies. In addition, the government recently ordered the National Bank to allocate the principal and interest of the US dollar bonds due on September 30th. The National Bank is processing the transfer procedures and will announce it soon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Fluctuates Unevenly</h3>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Customers Re-register and Number</h3>
<p>According to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the company has stipulated the following methods for renumbering customer registrations: (1) All customers who have been approved for registration, whose registration numbers are from 1 to 500, should collect the survey form from the company's promotion department from now on, fill it in again, and send it to the company for review before April 30th to renumber. (2) Starting from May 1st, the newly compiled registration numbers will be applied, and all old registration numbers will be cancelled.</p>

After the limit up, there was a transaction of 35 yuan outside the market. This morning, "New Light's Delivery" will debut for the first time. According to yesterday's trading, the trend will be more active.</p>
<h3>Seasonable Wool Fabrics Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wool fabric market was quite good. The sales of men's and women's colored wool fabrics in wool fabric clothing stores were brisk. Seasonable light-colored thin floral woolen fabrics, serge, venetian, palice, and feather yarn wool fabrics were more popular with customers and merchants. Due to the increasing actual sales due to the hot weather, the sales of Chinese and Western clothing have increased. The standard wholesale market price is still on the path of a clear firm and dark rise due to various facts and environmental factors. Looking at the retail price tags, each store is continuing to adjust them. Spring and summer goods that are slightly pleasing to the eye are priced at more than 40,000 yuan per yard, and each suit is mostly priced at around 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Government-Licensed Imports and Exports Between China and Korea Allowed for Transport</h3>
<p>China and Korea have not yet formally announced the opening of trade. Regarding the issue of import and export trade, Korea has sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate with our diplomatic authorities, but no concrete measures have been obtained so far. It is now known that import and export goods between the two countries that are licensed by the government are allowed to be transported. Otherwise, if any ships or sailboats transport goods from Korea into China or from China to Korea without permission, they will be prohibited. Any smuggling found will be detained.</p>
<h3>Affected by the Surge in Foreign Stocks, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Again - Up to Eleven Types Reach the Limit Up</h3>

<h3>No Formal Rice Transactions - Grain, Flour, and Oil Prices Rise Again - Off-Market White Rice Rises to 190,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market rose again yesterday, affected by the issuance of 10,000 yuan bills and reports of rising prices in the producing areas. A total of 5,686 stones of goods arrived in the north and south markets. The market price list of food rice, single japonica, and thin rice fields were all blank, and there was no price filled in. Japonica rice formed a situation where there were no goods to supply the market. The off-market prices were blindly shouted, and the prices secretly soared by more than 10,000 yuan. The authorities advised the industry to find ways to stabilize prices, so there were no formal transactions in the japonica rice market. Bai Yuansheng soared to a new high price of 196,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan also reached 182,000 yuan. The Social Bureau continued to release a total of 9,000 bags of white japonica, red pointed, and Saigon rice. The price of white japonica was still 135,500, red pointed was 120,500 yuan, and medium-sized Saigon was 110,000 yuan. The black market price of off-market white japonica has risen to 190,000 yuan, and the limited retail price of 165,000 yuan can no longer be supplied due to reports of rising prices in the producing areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to Ji Mingzhai, the head of the Food Section, the Social Bureau has released a total of 58,305 bags of white japonica, Saigon, and red pointed rice in the market in recent days. Among them, more than 30,000 bags are currently in the process of being shipped out. The rumor that rice merchants have paid for five or six days, but the allocated rice has not yet been given, is not true. It takes about three days to pay and complete the shipping procedures, and then the goods can be shipped. He said that he can only act as a firefighter doing his best to passively control the situation regarding the recent jump in rice prices. He said that it is beyond his ability to actively dredge the source and suppress the price of producing areas. He also said that Director Wu has gone to Beijing to attend the National Price Conference and should be able to come up with countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Various Firms Compete to Buy, Foreign Stocks Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks saw a large reduction in Hong Kong market water and were eagerly bought by Guang firms, securities firms, and banks, leading to a depletion of chips and unprecedentedly fierce price increases.

Bidding prices were approaching 50,000 yuan, and the situation was extremely chaotic. However, prices fell slightly after reaching a high.

<h3>Tea Market Transactions Sparse</h3>
<p>This year's new Longjing tea from Wenzhou, since the stock in the producing area has tended to shrink, the amount arriving recently is not as much as before, and those holding the goods have shouted up prices, resulting in an increase.  Mao Feng green tea, the current new goods in Tunxi are priced at 2.4 million yuan per unit, and new goods in Sian are 2 million yuan per load, but the prices here are exceptionally high, so sales are extremely sluggish.  As for various types of domestic old tea, supply and demand are not large, and the process remains in a state of deadlock.  Foreign firms' tea market buyers' appetite is still narrow, and they continue to plan to buy at low prices, the situation is still difficult to improve, and transactions continue to be sparse.</p>

<h3>Second Quarter Import Quotas Expected to Be Announced This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee held its 29th regular meeting on April 22nd. It has been learned that the resolutions are as follows: (1) The Central Bank has scheduled a joint meeting of the Export Promotion and Import Management Committees on April 23rd to discuss special import measures for packaging materials and raw materials needed for export goods. Once a resolution is obtained, it is expected to be implemented in the short term.

From the second quarter, the original examination standards can be appropriately relaxed. In addition to taking the import amount in 1946 as the standard, it is planned to simultaneously examine the import amount and reputation of various businesses before the war, and consider new import merchants who hold exclusive agency qualifications. (4) The import quota for Schedule (2) goods in the second quarter has been drafted by President Zhang with the amount and personally carried to Beijing to request approval from the National Economic Commission, and it is expected to be officially announced within this month. (5) President Zhang expressed great concern about the import applications that have not yet been processed by the Quota Allocation Office and the Non-Quota Examination Office, and has instructed the heads of the relevant offices at the meeting to clear them within a limited time. The work has been extremely tense in recent days. It is reported that approximately 30 to 40 cases can be processed daily in the first category, more than 100 cases in the second category, and 200 to 300 cases in the third category (Category A). It is hoped that all accumulated cases, whether approved or rejected, will be cleared by the end of May.</p>

<h3>Dalian Under the Iron Curtain</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bing Yu, Liaoyuan Airmail, 16th</p>
<p>Since an American ship carrying diplomatic mail and relief supplies sailed to Dalian, an American reporter accompanied it. As a result, the reporter's impressions quickly spread throughout the world. The timing of this news release was in late December last year, when Shenyang was covered in heavy snow and people were huddled indoors to keep warm. However, upon hearing the news that the U.S. State Department acknowledged that Dalian was still under Soviet military control, people couldn't help but feel a burning sensation.</p>
<p>Because Dalian is a major commercial port in the Northeast, with thriving trade and developed business, the people of Shenyang, which is the military and political center of the Northeast, are even more concerned about taking over Dalian. The movements of Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang and Special Commissioner Zhang Jianfei, as well as the negotiations between Soviet Ambassador and Foreign Minister Wang, are particularly noteworthy to the general public.</p>
<p>According to the main points of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance announced by the National Government on August 25, 1945, regarding the Dalian and Lushun issue, although our country has declared Dalian a free port, open to all trade and shipping, all administrative powers belong to our country, except that the port director is appointed by Soviet personnel, and the opening period is set at 30 years. Therefore, the timing of the takeover of Dalian is believed to be not far away. Due to the Communist army's widespread harassment of the people in Dalian, the people of Lushun, Dalian, and Jinzhou have repeatedly petitioned the authorities in Shenyang, and relevant parties speculate that military action to cooperate with the promotion of the takeover work is also highly possible.</p>
<p>The reporter originally intended to follow merchants to Dalian for an inspection last month, but Dalian, which is occupied by the Communists, absolutely does not allow any people from other provinces to go to Dalian. On the contrary, many refugees have secretly fled from Dalian, living a miserable life in Shenyang. Below is an account from a former teacher at a national school during the puppet Manchukuo era, who lamented to the reporter about the current situation in Dalian.</p>
<p>Since the victory, Dalian has not enjoyed the joy given by the victory. Only before November of the year before last, people from all walks of life in the local area organized a temporary organization called the Local Maintenance Committee, which was dedicated to maintaining the local area and protecting the properties and buildings of various enemies and puppets. After the current Communist army's "Dalian City" Deputy Mayor Chen Yuntao and "Lushun City" Deputy Mayor Chen Minli arrived in Dalian, they dissolved the Maintenance Committee, severely scolded the members, and arrogantly regarded themselves as "victorious figures."</p>
<p>The two puppet deputy mayors arrived in Lushun and Dalian empty-handed, so naturally they could not carry out any work. Therefore, they pushed out local financial magnates to be considered "democratically elected" "mayors." In fact, it was still under the means of threats and inducements that they were forced onto the stage. In the Communist Party's "political tactics," it was already considered "local autonomy" completed.</p>
<p>Outsiders may not believe it, or at least have some doubts, why so many local people in Dalian participate in the "municipal government" and other Communist Party organizations, especially women? In fact, the reason is also very simple. Although the old Eighth Route Army from Jiaodong are the cadres of the "municipal government," most of them are "rough guys" who can't even write the popular "colloquial official documents" (those who can write are already in charge). Therefore, the work of writing and calculating still has to be done by the locals. If they don't work in any organization, they will immediately be labeled as "national spies." Women, in order to avoid the danger of "public wives," also join the "Women's Federation" to serve, because there is still a small allowance to alleviate economic difficulties.</p>
<p>The Communist Party "municipal government," in order to trap scholars and Kuomintang members, deliberately collects some information and lists them as the Communist Party municipal government's roster. In fact, the Communist Party's genuine members are extremely strict about joining the party. This kind of foolish conspiracy has long been seen through by the local people. Moreover, the incompetence of the people in the Communist Party's municipal government, even the puppet-style "Lushun-Dalian Administrative Joint Office" Director and Deputy Director Chi Zixiang and Liu Xin, the former is a wine bag and the latter is a rice bucket, and Wang Xiping, the "Dalian County Chief" who manages the suburbs of Dalian, used to be a shop assistant in a leather shoe store. The former "Lushun-Dalian Police Bureau" Director Zhao Lebin, everyone knows that he is "Old Zhao" who sells used goods. The people of Dalian say that these phenomena are similar to the situation in the enemy-puppet era where a barber who worked for the Japanese was appointed as the county chief, with different tunes sung in harmony.</p>
<p>Although the puppet municipal government's organization is divided into various bureaus and offices, except for the finance and tax revenue agencies, which are the busiest (because collecting money and grain is their main task), the construction, public utilities, and office personnel, apart from warming themselves by the fire, are idle all day long.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Communist Party is still openly active in Dalian. In fact, espionage work is still carried out secretly. The ones in charge of the Dalian area are three people surnamed Han, Song, and Sun, all of whom are "local committee members" of the "Dalian City Party Committee." The local people only see them going out, with three or four guards, preceding and following them, but they cannot ask their names. Therefore, behind their backs, they are called Song Guang, Han Guang, and Sun Guang, separately nicknamed "Guang Kuo," and together they are called "San Guang Ma Zi." A "training center" is specially set up near Sanchun Town, ostensibly to train party members, but in reality, it is an agency for espionage work research. When work reviews are submitted for discussion, if it is found that someone wants to abandon the darkness and turn to the light or is "not loyal to the party," they will be imprisoned lightly or executed heavily. Therefore, some Communist Party members who are deeply dissatisfied with the reality appear happy, but secretly act carelessly, taking it one day at a time.</p>
<p>In terms of the Communist Party's party affairs in Dalian, the class system is very strict, which is contrary to the high-sounding tune of "no class." Moreover, the prominence of the "local committee" and the snobbery of the "party members" have caused the "Communist Party" to play a major role in all administrative agencies. The political commissar of any agency can overturn the decision of its supervisor, just like the Japanese deputy officials in the puppet Manchukuo government "guiding" the puppet Manchukuo officials.</p>
<p>There is no "democracy" in Dalian. Even the "democratic politics" that the Communist Party is good at, hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat, cannot be seen. The active results of the "struggle meetings" and "liquidation meetings" have given idle ruffians an opportunity to make a temporary career as a "cheering squad." And arresting people is entirely at their discretion. "Freedom" cannot be seen in Dalian.</p>
<p>There is no "culture" to speak of in Dalian under the Communist army's occupation. Three party-run newspapers—Dalian Daily, Shinhua Bao, and Xinsheng Times—have very smooth sales (because they are sold by force). The news is the same everywhere. What is seen on the paper is all articles praising the Communist Party. The so-called "mass words" are nothing more than fabricated things that insult the government and extinguish conscience.</p>
<p>Ideological control is very strict. All radios in the city have been confiscated. No one can hear the news from Beiping and Nanjing. However, the lecture sessions held by the fang gong suo force every resident to attend. Public servants, teachers, and students from various puppet agencies and schools are forced to participate. Communist Party agents mix among them. If anyone expresses unwillingness, they will definitely be subject to severe and cruel punishment. In the Xigang Branch of the Police Bureau, the Shahekou Branch, and the detention center of the court, these ideological prisoners are full every day.</p>
<p>Speaking of red education, students from the "Lushun-Dalian National Construction College" often wear five-cornered hats. This is the highest red academy. They graduate in six months. Although they are divided into classes and departments, the students are all transferred from various agencies for training. There are very few lessons every day, just things like "Socialism," "Marxist Theory," "New Democracy and the United Government," and "Democracy and Struggle." The president is "Local Committee" Han Guang, and the vice president is Yuan Muhua, who is the director of the Education Committee of the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Joint Office, that is, an "education agent." If any student is considered to have "ideological wavering," they will be arrested the next day. And there are often unfamiliar faces among the classmates. There is no need to ask more. They are "special commissioners" for ideological research. In the two municipal secondary schools for boys and girls, political classes are also taught, with Communist Party political commissars serving as teachers. Other subjects such as mathematics and science are three hours per week, and Russian and English are two hours per week, with the former being more important than the latter. Primary schools, on the other hand, don't matter at all. They sing revolutionary songs every day, which saves the teachers the trouble of grading papers. "Latinization of Chinese Characters" is the slogan of the Communist Party's education agencies. After implementation, it has created the fact of obliterating Chinese culture. The citizens of Dalian all expressed their opposition to this vicious method, but under the oppression of the Communist Party's iron hooves, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out!</p>
<p>Today's industry and commerce in Dalian truly make people disbelieve that this is a major commercial port.</p>
<p>The "municipal government's" tax collection work is too zealous. Private industries and businesses cannot shoulder the heavy burden of exorbitant taxes. If they have any wealth, they may be struggled against. Therefore, since the "municipal government" was established not long ago, the trend of closures has been rampant. Nine out of ten private factories have been liquidated. And what about the "state-run" ones? They organized Yuhua, Xinhua, Liaodong, and other cooperatives with the people's fat and blood. Grain prices and commodity prices are adjusted at any time. Only state-run businesses are allowed in sea and land transportation, industry, and trade. Private businesses are not allowed.</p>
<p>Today, factories in Dalian are destroyed, workers are unemployed, and merchants are squeezed, causing the people's lives to fall into unprecedented poverty. Starving people are everywhere, and beggars are endless on the road. The refugees at Shihe Station don't even have sorghum rice to eat. But the Communist Party personnel who manage the refugees still frequent prostitutes, drink alcohol, and seek pleasure.</p>
<p>On the streets, only Japanese prostitutes are seen. The Japanese girls at the entrance of the cafeteria are not transformed goddesses? As long as you spend 500 yuan in "Northeast Bank" currency, she can satisfy your desires. Is this heaven or hell!</p>
<p>Along the port of Dalian, there are only small state-run steamships cruising, and armed speedboats also patrol from time to time. Apart from this, there are only certain warships and merchant ships coming and going between Lushun and Dalian. The common people dare not go deep into the coastal areas, at most they can only peek at the station half a mile from the port. What can often be seen is certain parties busy with transportation. Trams and electric lights still exist in some parts. After using four generators, Dalian is often without water again. The flowers and trees in Central Park and the tour boats in Xingpu can only be recalled by the citizens of Dalian, because these are all examples of being destroyed.</p>
<p>The Western-style houses on both sides of Xigang Street and Huichun Street are nine out of ten empty. Japanese residents have been repatriated to their country, and citizens have fled one after another. These empty Western-style houses have become refugee concentration camps. No tourists can be seen in Nanshan, the racecourse is almost in ruins, and the airport runway is also damaged. The past prosperity and liveliness cannot be seen in Dalian. The pedestrians who come and go, in addition to the red elements flaunting their power, are filled with a sad and gloomy atmosphere throughout Dalian. The citizens of Dalian, who live in deep water and scorching heat, are the same in Lushun and Jin County, longing for the government to take over Dalian as soon as possible, so that the people can breathe a breath of free and fresh air!</p>

<h3>Suzhou Municipal Council Special Record</h3>
<p>— Our Suzhou dispatch, 8th. Special correspondent Wu Shouren</p>
<p>The first popularly elected Municipal Council of Suzhou was formally established on the 15th of last month. The 143 councilors are all outstanding figures from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational circles, who were honored with a seat representing public opinion after a heated election process. In the past few months, which was the period of gestation for this great popular election, the reporter silently observed the movements of all parties with a very objective eye, and felt that the competition with each other was enthusiastic, truly like a raging fire. Especially for the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, it showed a fully democratic sentiment! Of course, there were inevitably some differences of opinion due to the different central figures. From this competitive angle, we can see the people's concern for politics today, reaching an ideal level! Among the competitors, they can probably be divided into three major groups: one is the veteran faction centered on Mr. Song Jicheng; another is the younger faction surrounding Mr. Wu Wentian; and the third is the education faction centered on Mr. Fan Gongren, a leading figure in the educational and cultural circles.</p>
<p>New Route</p>
<p>Not long after Mr. Wu Wentian returned to Suzhou from Shanghai, the Central Government suddenly announced the new appointment of him as a legislator. According to the regulations, public officials cannot concurrently serve as representatives of public opinion. The decision to choose should of course be to accept the legislator and give up the councilor. Mr. Qian Dajun, in a non-official capacity, expressed his willingness to assist in the construction work of his hometown. After the news spread, Suzhou and the surrounding areas were immediately in an uproar. With Mu Yin's reputation and status, it was the most ideal destination. However, for Mu Yin to serve as the Speaker, this is by no means a simple election issue. The main thing should be to find him a Deputy Speaker who can cooperate, so as to have the confidence to encourage Mu Yin to take on the role without hesitation. However, in fact, this problem is indeed not easy to solve.</p>
<p>The younger generation decided on a brand-new route, which is to support Mr. Qian Dajun as the Speaker and Mr. Yan Xinqi as the Deputy Speaker. Undoubtedly, this is a highly激烈的fan-dong. The education faction naturally combined to form a mixed camp, with the central idea of supporting Mr. Song Jicheng as the Speaker and Mr. Fan Gongren as the Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>Strength Estimate</p>
<p>If we make a fair estimate of the basic strength of these two major camps, new and old, the proportion is not enough to control the odds of the election. The new camp, mainly composed of the younger generation, has a basic strength of only one-third of the total number of councilors, while the old camp, mainly composed of the veteran and education factions, has a basic strength of only one-fifth. The remaining majority of one-half are completely middle-of-the-road people who have no party affiliation and can swing to either side. The fact is very clear: whoever can grasp these many middle-of-the-road people will truly win the victory!</p>
<p>Grasping the middle-of-the-road people is not simply achieved by activity contacts. They are often sufficient to truly represent public opinion in many places. Therefore, the main condition for grasping the middle-of-the-road people is still to see how the social public's psychological trends are? After the war, the social public's psychology almost surged and flooded, emphasizing the two major prerequisites of seeking peace and seeking construction. However, the vast majority of them know that the elements of seeking peace and seeking construction must first have a strong economic backing, second must have the support of a heroic character, and third must have a weighty reputation. If the three elements can be prepared day by day, then the psychology of seeking peace and seeking construction, even if there is no immediate guarantee of realization, can ultimately exist with some hope of longing. The social public's psychological trends are like this. Then, the figures who can best meet these three elements are naturally none other than Mr. Qian Dajun and Mr. Yan Xinqi! Therefore, when the council was established and the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker was launched, Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan finally emerged with the largest majority of 97 votes and 84 votes to serve as the first Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Suzhou. This result, we should say that it is the success of activity contacts, rather than the social public's psychological makeup, is more relevant to the facts!</p>
<p>Mr. Qian's Reputation</p>
<p>But then again, although the social public's psychology emphasizes seeking peace and seeking construction, how can it be seen that Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan can indeed shoulder these two expectations of the vast public and confidently and without hesitation trust and appoint them? The reasons for this are nothing more than two points: (1) Mr. Qian Dajun has considerable potential and foundation in politics. Everyone believes that although he is in a non-official capacity, he still has the status of 言九重鼎. Once he serves as the Speaker, in the future, the separation between officials and the people, and the suffering of the people, can be communicated and conveyed by him, which will inevitably lead the province and county to pay more attention to it. (2) Mr. Yan Xinhong has always been in a leading position in the local economy, and his style over the years has not entered the capitalist circle. He has been happy to sponsor and support the public welfare construction undertakings of the local community, which has been commonly seen and known by the public. If he serves as the Deputy Speaker, then the promotion of local construction undertakings in the future can at least achieve the effect of one person's advocacy leading to a hundred responses, which is more directly beneficial to the public's expectations of seeking peace and seeking construction!</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's Expression</p>
<p>The analysis of the public's psychological belief in Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan has been described above. However, we should study whether they can in fact match the public's psychology and reward the ardent hopes of the 1.18 million people of Suzhou? Here, we can objectively report Mr. Yan Xinqi's expression on future tasks: "I believe that the actual pain and psychological fear given to the people by the post-war social environment are truly interwoven and complex. Even with the perseverance and determination to save them from drowning and solve their problems, it is not easy to gradually rescue and improve them in a way that is appropriate for both urgent and slow matters. Therefore, if a true public opinion institution wants to fully exert its functions, it must first understand what the most urgent and most important thing is for the people's suffering today, and then proceed step by step to seek rescue and improvement according to the correct procedure, so as not to reverse the order of urgency and neglect the fundamentals. In my personal opinion, I feel that the crux of the current suffering of the people is nothing more than the instability of the rural areas; and the reasons for the rural unrest are complex. To draw its outline, the main thing is that the burden on farmers is too heavy. Therefore, in the future, the council will give close consideration to the determination of township and village expenses, the abolition of harsh miscellaneous taxes, the increase in production, and the handling of cooperative transportation and sales, etc., to save the rural economy with both radical and palliative measures, and formulate concrete plans for gradual implementation. Secondly, the pain of public teachers, the exhaustion of commercial economy, and the flooding of unemployment are all prepared to gather ideas and discuss effective remedial measures. As for the superficial rectification of the local society, which is related to the external outlook, I think it is relatively easy to start with, and will take the lead in advocating."</p>
<p>From the above remarks, we can understand that Mr. Yan sees the current advantages and disadvantages very clearly. At the same time, we can also see that he seems to have quite a determination to promote advantages and eliminate disadvantages.</p>
<p>For the time being, the result of the first congress of the council is undoubtedly the turning point in the fate of the local society of Suzhou, determining whether it can turn from bad to good. However, local construction work is the responsibility of everyone, especially the rights and obligations of the councilors to take on the arduous task without hesitation, and they must work together to exert their efforts in order to have hope. We believe that the election phase has passed, and the future should be a time of harmony and cooperation. Here, we offer our infinite expectations!</p>

<h3>Liang Yansun's Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Over the past decade, due to my focus on modern historical materials, I have read many people's chronicles. Among them, I find the "Chronicle of Mr. Liang Yansun of Sanshui" to be one of the most interesting, even more meaningful to read than the Chronicle of Ye Gongchuo.</p>
<p>Liang Yansun's chronicle begins in the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1869) and ends in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. During these sixty-five years, China experienced drastic changes in politics, economics, transportation, diplomacy, and culture. Mr. Liang lived through this era, and his actions and career were directly or indirectly closely related to these areas. Therefore, this chronicle is very much a miniature of modern history.</p>
<p>The entire work is divided into two volumes, upper and lower, in a sixteen-mo format, totaling over a thousand pages and more than seven hundred thousand words, which can be described as a grand spectacle. The first edition was published in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic, with a revised second edition recently released. It includes four illustrations.</p>
<p>The chronicle naturally focuses on the subject's life and career. However, if one were to narrate and include all the experiences, actions, and works of a person over several decades, even millions of words would not be enough. This is especially true for prominent figures in the political arena, who have numerous connections and abundant materials. How can one include everything? The principle of "宁缺毋滥" (寧缺毋濫, "better to have less than to have inferior quality") can be applied. Moreover, when a person's connections are broad, there are many things that cannot be published or are not yet ready for publication, so one must reluctantly omit them or temporarily keep them reserved. Therefore, it is difficult to write chronicles and autobiographies of contemporary figures without intentional omissions, and there is nothing that can be done about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of Liang Yansun (Shiyi), he has thirty years of history in politics. While many people praised him, there were also several instances where people misunderstood his environment or the inside story of certain events, making him the target of public criticism. The most notable examples include the Five-Route Petition Case, the preparation for Yuan Shikai's enthronement, the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway, and the Major Transportation Case. The chronicle reveals the truth behind these events, allowing people to understand the underlying context. Of course, some details related to other parties involved cannot be disclosed too explicitly. However, from this, we can gain a much clearer understanding compared to previous hearsay.</p>
<p>In terms of historical facts, the chronicle details major domestic events over sixty years, such as the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, the revision of the Sino-British Treaty on Opium Suppression, the Xinhai Revolution, the establishment of the Republic of China, the Second Revolution, the Sino-Russian Agreement, the Twenty-One Demands, Yuan Shikai's betrayal, the restoration of the Republic, participation in World War I and the recruitment of laborers, Puyi's restoration, the Ma Chang Campaign against Zhang Xun, the establishment of the Guangzhou Constitutional Protection Government, the North-South Peace Conference, the Shandong Problem, the Zhili-Anhui War, the Washington Conference, Hunan's provincial autonomy, the First and Second Zhili-Fengtian Wars, Chen Jiongming's rebellion, the Lincheng Kidnapping Case, Cao Kun's bribery, the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, the expulsion of Puyi from the Forbidden City, Duan Qirui's provisional government, Sun Yat-sen's journey north, the Post-War Conference, the Gold Franc Case and the new agreement, the May Thirtieth Movement, the establishment of the National Government, the abolition of Likin (internal transit tax), the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, Zhang Zuolin's appointment as Grand Marshal, the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, national unification, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and major plans such as the raising of various public debts, transportation construction, and finance. In particular, the details regarding the financial and transportation sectors are so comprehensive that it would not be an exaggeration to call it a thirty-year history of finance and transportation. Among the chronicles of various individuals over the past decades, none can match its richness.</p>
<p>The book contains several descriptions of Liang's resourcefulness in dealing with crises and his anecdotes. For example, his experience while fleeing Beijing to Huairou to avoid the Boxer Rebellion is described as follows:</p>
<p>"On the 21st of this month (May), Mr. Liang, along with Madam Gao, his concubine Ms. Pan, sons Dingji, Dingwu, and a female servant, left Beijing. They first traveled by land to Tongzhou and then sailed south along the Grand Canal. The group included Guan Boheng (Mianjun) and his family, totaling over a hundred people, including men, women, old, and young. As soon as they arrived at Muzhuang, they were met with cannon fire and could not pass, forcing them to go to Hexiwu. While on the boat, they found altars in every village and Boxers everywhere along the way. They were forced to worship the altars and burn paper money. Anyone whose ashes from burning the paper money did not fly up was immediately labeled a 'Han traitor' and killed without mercy. Mr. Liang, helpless in the face of violence, wore loose-fitting clothes and, with each bow, flicked his sleeves, causing the ashes to fly up, thus narrowly escaping death many times. One day, when Guan Boheng bowed, the ashes did not fly up, and they were about to seize him. Boheng turned pale. Mr. Liang shouted loudly, 'Lord Guan is not afraid!' The Boxer leader admired Guan Yu and often referred to him as 'Lord Guan.' Hearing this, they released him. Boheng was drenched in sweat."</p>
<p>Liang's lectures at Fenggang Academy also have an interesting anecdote. The academy traditionally selected sixty outstanding students each month and awarded them stipends. Mr. Liang, to encourage poor scholars, increased the number of recipients and donated money for the awards. The locals followed suit, and hundreds of people came to the academy. There was a scholar named Chen in the county, an elder scholar, who was seventy years old. On the day of the monthly examination, he brought his two sons to help him write. Taking advantage of Mr. Liang's distraction, he secretly passed the draft behind the pillars. Mr. Liang pretended not to notice. When the essay was submitted, Mr. Liang wrote, "The love of parents for their children is all-encompassing. As children, we should take the parents' heart as our own. In the future, when you become famous, please do not forget the sight of your father embracing the pillar in his old age."</p>
<p>During the Zhili-Fengtian War, when the Fengtian army retreated to Junliangcheng, Liang, along with Ye Gongchuo and Zhang Hu, were placed on the wanted list and stripped of their honors and medals. According to the truth stated in the book, "When the order to punish them was about to be issued, some around Mr. Liang advised him to send a telegram to defend himself. Mr. Liang said, 'During Hongxian's reign, I still served Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai), what is today? Since I became an official, I have dedicated myself to the country and have long put life, death, fortune, and misfortune out of my mind. What is there to defend? Zhang Taiyue (Zhang Juzheng) once wrote in his reply to Wu Yaoshan, "Twenty years ago, I had a grand wish to use my body as a mattress for people to lie on, and they could urinate and defecate on it without my interference. If someone wanted to cut off my ears and nose, I would gladly give them." This is Jiangling's (Zhang Juzheng's) confident statement. Although I dare not compare myself to Jiangling, I have never forgotten this wish. If the order is issued, I will take a raft and return to serve my elderly father.' The next evening, he suddenly received a call from the State Council in Beijing, asking Mr. Liang to listen in person. Speaking, it was none other than Zhou Ziqi, the acting Premier. He stated that the order to punish them was about to be issued, and he should countersign the documents because he was an acting Premier. Zhou felt sorry for his decades-old friend and asked Mr. Liang to leave Tianjin immediately to avoid arrest. Mr. Liang said, '(Ziqi) (周字, Zhou's name) thank the East Sea for me, when the tide of the East Sea is calm, perhaps we will meet again! If not you and I, what traces will there be? Future historians will see Zhou Ziqi countersigning the arrest of Liang Shiyi as a good story in political history.' The conversation ended. Not long after, Zhou was also forced to resign and went south to visit Mr. Liang. They met in bewilderment. Later, when Zhou was critically ill, he summoned Zhang Junming and said, 'Looking back on my life, the matter of countersigning the arrest of Liang Yanlao (Liang Shiyi) is the most regretful to my conscience. After I die, please convey my apology.' It is also commendable."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that in the officialdom, the waves are treacherous, and right and wrong are uncertain. Those who do not know the inside story are truly lost in a fog. Especially after each political change, the result is that the generals with troops are never punished, only a few literati are wrongly blamed, and the case is closed.</p>
<h3>Simple Experiments: Wireless Radio</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Edited by Liu Tongkang, published by World Book Company</p>
<p>Writing a good basic introductory book is not necessarily easier than writing an advanced theoretical book. It is a thankless task, just like the work of elementary school teachers is not valued.</p>
<p>Although China's wireless radio industry is quite developed in general, there are few Chinese books on wireless radio, and practical books for beginners are even rarer. This book can be said to be the only one, and I would like to solemnly recommend it to all amateur radio enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The greatest feature of the book is that it is detailed without being cumbersome and that it incorporates basic theory into experiments. These two points can not only arouse the beginner's interest in exploring wireless radio, but also inspire his wisdom to create new things and turn them into his own new blood and new flesh. A book is dead, it only has a certain limited amount of content, but due to its inspiration, it can expand the small into the large, turn the dead into the living, so that it can be operated at will and increase the effectiveness of the book tenfold, a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold. There are many small things that seem verbose and redundant to those who are experienced in this field, but they are invaluable instructions to a friend who has just stepped across the threshold. For example, the soldering work that must be used in the experiment is considered by amateur practitioners who have been assembling and disassembling for several years to be nothing more than ordinary work, so why elaborate on it, but for beginners it is not necessarily a quite difficult thing, precisely because it is ordinary, so it is more important, try to see that the most common and ordinary work in the world, which one is not the most important and most necessary? It seems that it is the most ordinary and easiest thing for a writer to write a short essay or diary, but an elementary school student has only written the title after scribbling for a long time! Wireless radio work is especially true, a child no one guides blindly bumping into truly do not know how many injustice losses to eat, how much injustice road to walk, not only waste money and effort, and often will grind away many beginners a cavity of enthusiasm, to think that wireless radio is a rare extraordinary something unattainable, because the heart is disheartened, abandoned halfway or even dare not ask Jin, the advantage of this book is here, it can become a good companion for beginners, avoid many unnecessary setbacks and unexpected troubles. It uses simple experiments to introduce beginners into the web of wireless radio, and also gives him the courage to continue his efforts.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five chapters: first, it discusses the installation of the antenna and lightning arrester, tools, and soldering work. The second chapter introduces the basic parts of wireless radio in detail, not only describing the appearance, internal structure, efficacy, and performance of each part, but also interspersing some easy-to-understand important theories at any time to understand why, which makes this book a living thing rather than a soulless shell. Each part also has clear illustrations and special numbers. The last three chapters are the production of crystal radios, single-tube radios, and two-tube radios, which are not only the skeleton of circuit diagrams and parts lists, but also have three-dimensional wiring diagrams, coil winding methods, parts installation and arrangement, as well as radio receiving methods, experimental results, and other bloody and easy-to-digest things. The four circuit boards of the crystal radio are very simple and effective, but there are many places in the state that have branching devices, which in fact often bring some trouble to beginners, which is inevitably a small flaw. Several single-tube and two-tube circuits are also very common, but common does not mean that it is not good, the things that have been eliminated by countless experiments are also the most suitable for practical needs.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning is that this book is not only suitable for amateur radio enthusiasts in big cities, but also for researchers in poor rural areas. Because in addition to the use of DC power, there is also a homemade AB battery method!</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Mr. Liu's newly compiled "World Wireless Radio Vacuum Tube Encyclopedia", and I feel that Mr. Liu is still working hard for the wireless radio publishing business, then I sincerely hope that Mr. Liu can continue to write a slightly more advanced experimental book after this book, which will definitely be of great benefit to many friends who study wireless radio.</p>
<h3>Introducing Two Books on Reading Guidance</h3>
<p>— Huang Weilian</p>
<p>An Example of Skimming Guidance, An Example of Intensive Reading Guidance, co-authored by Ye Shaojun and Zhu Ziqing, published by Commercial Press in 1946 and 1947 respectively.</p>
<p>Western philosopher Bacon once said in his essay collection: "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be skimmed, others to be read at will, and still others are to be read intensively." Zeng Wenzhenggong also said in his family motto: "The essentials of reading, looking, reading, writing, four things, must not be lacking one day. Looking is like looking at the Records of the Grand Historian, the Book of Han, Han Yu's articles, Reflections at Hand, and the Zhouyi Zhezhong. Reading is like reading the Four Books, the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Book of Changes, the Zuo Zhuan, the Selections of Refined Literature, the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and the articles of Han Yu, Ouyang Xiu, Zeng Gong, and Wang Anshi. If you do not recite them loudly, you cannot grasp their magnificence; if you do not meditate on them silently, you cannot explore their profound charm." Looking at books and reading books, neither can be neglected.</p>
<p>No matter what people do, they should have proper methods, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. We should also be the same for the way of reading. Therefore, reading should also be guided, if you can understand the way of reading, you will not waste time and work without success. If there is no method for reading, it is like sailing without a compass, just drifting in the vast sea, unable to reach the destination.</p>
<p>The two books introduced in this article are both one of the Chinese Language Teaching Series of the Sichuan Provincial Education Science Museum. Although they are written for the reference of Chinese language teachers in middle schools, they are also beneficial to ordinary students. The compilation of the two books is similar in method, with a "Preface" in front and a "General Guidance" in the back, one for skimming guidance and one for intensive reading guidance, and the selected materials are also different. The book on skimming lists seven books as examples, including one scripture, one excerpt of famous works, one anthology of poetry, two anthologies, and two novels; among them, "Mencius", "Selected Essence of the Records of the Grand Historian", "Three Hundred Tang Poems", and "Selected Essays of Hu Shi" are suitable for high school students to read, and "Selected Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Yuanpei", "Call to Arms", and "Education of Love" are suitable for junior high school students to read.</p>
<p>The book on intensive reading guidance selects six articles as examples, including one narrative, one short story, one lyric, one explanatory text, and two argumentative essays; among them, "Longgang Qian Biao" and "On Feudalism" are commonly seen in textbooks, and "The Beginning of the Second Anti-Japanese War to the National People's Book" is in the category of supplementary teaching materials stipulated by the Ministry. Shang You Lu Xun's "Medicine", Xu Zhimo's "Cambridge I Know" and Hu Shi's "On New Poetry" (excerpt) are also common middle school supplementary teaching materials.</p>
<p>Because of the two different kinds of teaching materials with different properties, there are two different kinds of guidance. "Skimming guidance must be concise and self-contained; intensive reading guidance must be exhaustive (giving full play to the spirit of salt)", this is their teaching experience. In the preface guidance of the book on skimming, there are the following guidelines such as "edition guidance", "preface and table of contents guidance", "reference books guidance", "reading method guidance", and "problem guidance". In the preface guidance of intensive reading, there are "reading the whole text", "knowing new words and phrases", "answering the questions raised by the teacher", and other preparatory work; and then there are "recitation", "referring to relevant texts, answering the teacher's questions" and other practice work.</p>
<p>According to the above two books, originally as tools for reading guidance, the selected articles, since they are called examples, are certainly not perfect, and cannot be said to be standard; it seems that what we should pay attention to and is worth introducing is that these two books can represent a method of reading guidance. For example, regarding the compilation of books on national studies, there are several kinds that have been published, with Hu Shi and Liang Qichao's "Bibliography of National Studies" in front, and Li Lizhi's "Summary of Selected Books for National Studies" in the back. If you can follow the format set by the authors, Zhu and Zhu, whether it is skimming or intensive reading, let the readers choose any of the basic books of national studies to devote themselves to research and discussion, then day by day, month by month, it will be easy to get started.</p>
<p>In short, skimming and intensive reading, as Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "It is like the battle of military strategists, skimming is like looking at books, then it is attacking cities and seizing land, and opening up territory; intensive reading is like reading books, then it is deep trenches and strong fortresses, and being able to defend the land." Today's education system is divided into elementary school, middle school, and university; in the elementary school period, the childhood is not enlightened, and in practice, what is learned cannot get its actual reality, the middle school period is indeed the most important period, the knowledge sought should not only be advanced from the offensive side, but also should be firm from the defensive side; reading at this time, should spend more effort studying the books, as Bacon said, some books should be tasted, and some books should be chewed carefully, then the roots are firm and the leaves are lush, and can be used as a foundation for future construction.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Ladderless Tower</h3>
<p>— Yi Yuan</p>
<p>Written by Bu Shaofu, published by News and World Publishing House</p>
<p>This book contains thirty-five essays, all written by the author in the rear during the war. Because the author is a journalist, the articles in this collection include records of wartime life, descriptions of battlefield scenery, sketches of characters, and descriptions of personal feelings. The writing of the whole book is concise and lively, and the charming style is often described in a few words, not only incisively, but also more fresh, making people reluctant to put it down. What is especially commendable is that the author writes profound truths effortlessly, and readers do not have a headache when reading them. With a few light words, it contains good advice for life and dealing with the world. Although the essays in this collection are mainly lyrical and realistic, there are words of "carrying the Tao" in them. The seriousness is its ease. This wonderful application really produced a new style of writing for our essays.</p>
<p>In terms of "carrying the Tao", randomly quoting the author's original text, you can see: "Our general ideas, to be honest, are monopolized by the sentence in the Three Character Classic, "Diligence is rewarding, play is useless." When you mention pleasure, you think of uselessness, which is really harmful." The author is obviously defending the Tao here. But this Tao is not the Tao of those self-righteous moralists who think of depravity when they mention entertainment. He is defending the human right to entertainment. Entertainment does not mean hurting public morals, and entertainment does not mean wasting money. There are many moralists, or pseudo-moralists, in the world now, but the author is defending the right path. However, his defense of the Tao does not reveal a self-righteous appearance, but is interspersed in a light melody like a foxtrot, which is what makes it so valuable.</p>
<p>Since each article in this collection was written during the war, the depiction of wartime life is naturally the most distinctive. The author, with his keen sense of humor, really painted several pictures that make people smile knowingly; such as:</p>
<p>"At noon, I ran into 369, because my intestines had been without oil for a long time, so I ordered a bowl of Four Happiness Noodles. The waiter said:</p>
<p>Sir! Too fatty, right? How about sparerib noodles?</p>
<p>I quickly said: No! No! I'm not afraid of fat."</p>
<p>However, this is also a wartime life picture that makes people sigh a little!</p>
<p>I solemnly recommend this book to people who love literature, history (records of wartime life are also a kind of history), and humor. This is a book worth reading.</p>

<h3>Occasional Notes on a Visit to Jianglang Mountain</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>The Yue River flows east, dissolving into the water, turning back to look at my hometown, separated by ten thousand layers.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will pass by Jianglang Mountain, where hibiscus flowers are inserted deep in the azure clouds.</p>
<p>Jianglang Mountain is located in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, and is the most strangely steep peak in Southeast China. From Shimen Township, walk for several miles to first see hibiscus flowers inserted high in the azure clouds, suddenly embraced, and then see the peak divided into two, standing side by side. Walking to its front, it is shaped like the Chinese character "川" (川, river), clearly three peaks. Therefore, it is also called Sanpanshi (三爿石, Three Slabs of Stone).</p>
<p>One of the three peaks is slightly lower. From a distance, it seems to be wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. Only when you get closer do you realize it is not. This matches Xu Xiake's description of being sharp at the top and converging at the bottom. From Yu Jiawu, it is about three miles uphill, passing Huashi Pavilion, ascending eighteen bends, and reaching Kaiming Temple. In front of it is the Tang Dynasty scholar Zhu Dongshan's vine, and it is also the former residence of Zhou Wenxing, a Ming Dynasty recluse from Fenglin. The people in the temple gave us local products such as large tea leaves and Shijai Huanhuncao (石載還魂草, Sedum sarmentosum Bunge). Leaving from the back door of the temple, climb the Zhonggu Cave and set off firecrackers, the sound of which is as loud as bells and drums. Next, go through a large depression, looking up at the cliffs, which stand upright for thousands of yards. I have been to Jianmen Pass in Sichuan, and although Jianmen Pass is majestic, I feel that it can never be as strangely steep as this. Walking along the rocks, I was trembling with fear, using large reed leaves as divination to walk like a snake, my feet wet and soaked from yesterday's rain. After climbing to a high place and resting for a while, turn to a small depression and descend, as if walking in a long canyon, looking up, my mind was dizzy and my breath was taken away. There is a stone valley and Huanhuncao under the rocks. I picked up a few and set off firecrackers again. The sound was deafening and earth-shattering, and the echo was especially loud. Descending the mountain, I rested at Jianglang Temple.</p>
<p>Fang Yusheng slightly said:</p>
<p>"Jianglang Mountain is also known as Yulang Mountain, also known as Jinshan, fifty miles away from Jiangshan County, six hundred xun high. Also known as Xulang Mountain." The Dongyang Record says: "Jinshun Mountain has three peaks, all hundreds of feet high, the color is dazzling red, and it is impossible to look up at it." The Taiping Huanyu Ji says: "Jianglin Mountain has five-colored stones, which are dazzling in the sun." Today, I have personally visited it, and it is not quite so.</p>
<p>People cannot reach the top of the mountain. It is said that there is a pond on it that produces blue lotus and golden fish, where immortals live. There are rocks halfway up the mountain, and dangerous rocks hang in the air, in which a hut can be built.</p>
<p>Xiangshan (Bai Juyi) wrote a poem: "The two boys of Linlu never eat, the three sons of Jianglang dream of returning home. How can I get wings to fly, to come and go with you and get drunk in the misty clouds." This is based on what the Wen Si Bo Yao said: "The three Jiang brothers ascended to heaven and turned into stone." It is probably because these three peaks are too peculiar, so they mystified the story.</p>
<h3>Spring Bathing in Huaqing</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>Early spring in Chang'an; you see that the snow on the Zhongnan and Taibai mountains has not melted, but the green grass has sprouted between the Jing and Wei rivers. After eating enough yellow sand in the three winter months, people naturally think of the story of "the emperor bestows bathing in the Huaqing Pool in the spring cold."</p>
<p>Huaqing Pool is located outside the south gate of Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, forty miles east of Chang'an. You can get there by train in an hour; it is backed by Lishan Mountain and faces the desert wilderness, with pavilions, small bridges, lotus ponds, and flower gardens. There are several bathrooms built according to the flow of hot springs. The most exquisite and fascinating is the Imperial Concubine Pool.</p>
<p>The Imperial Concubine Pool can be used for bathing by four people together, with vermilion railings and jade steps, and inlaid with milky glass windows. There are white lotus flowers in the pool. In the shimmering light, your thoughts drift farther and farther; who says that the white smoke and smooth spring water have not left the imperial concubine's remaining fat?</p>
<p>On the mountain road, the Zhongshan Forest is lined with dwarf pine trees, and the area is quite secluded. There are small temples such as the Sanyuan Cave, Dimu Temple, and Laojun Hall scattered nearby. The Zhongzheng Forest has not been built for long, and the planted saplings are pitifully thin, but the stone path is clean and easy for tourists to go up and down. After walking uphill from Zhongzheng Forest for a short time, you will pass the place where the Chairman was captured during the Xi'an Incident. The walls are full of inscriptions, all from the hands of prominent figures in the Party and the country. This protruding peak wall arches over a large blue stone; if you sit on the meditation stone, the mountains behind, to the left, and to the right are all hidden from view, and you can only see the terraced fields and village trees in the distance at the foot of the mountain, and a line of the Wei River meandering eastward.</p>
<p>The mountain lacks strange peaks and original stones; green shade is also rare, with only short pine trees at high places. There is an ancient temple in the mountainside, dark and quiet, with crows cawing on the old pagoda trees next to the hall, giving people a feeling of being outside the world. There are several Taoist priests there. The summit of the mountain is the Zhou Youwang Beacon Tower, open and bare; three thousand years ago, green smoke pillars once rose straight into the sky here, and princes from all directions gathered at the foot of the mountain. The ancient emperor's romantic absurdity ultimately won him a smile from a beauty, but the dynasty came to an end from then on.</p>
<h3>Journey to Sun Moon Lake</h3>
<p>— Feng Qian</p>
<p>As the car drove out of Tainan, we gradually left the vast fields, rushing towards the mountains. We passed through many deep mountain tunnels and elevated bridges. Peering out, the car had turned into the white clouds. After a light mist passed, the scenery in the mountains suddenly opened up. The Zhuoshui River was as slender as a ribbon, winding between the mountains and the sky, and what was in front of us was still a dark green mountain range.</p>
<p>After driving in the mountains for three hours, we arrived at Sun Moon Lake, one of the eight scenic spots in Taiwan. The beautiful lake view gave travelers endless joy. And the Hanbi Building, hidden in the lush green, was also close at hand. Hanbi Building is the only hotel on the shore of Sun Moon Lake. It faces the mountain and overlooks the water. All four sides are small glass windows with square lattices. Leaning on the railing and looking out, the lake and mountain scenery shimmering in the forest can be seen by everyone. Of course, we also rested here.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the white misty curtain added a light morning dress to the lake. When the early mist disappeared with time, the lake was like a mirror, clearly reflecting the shadows of the surrounding green mountains. Occasionally, a fishing dugout floated by indifferently, drawing a silver light on the dark green lake mirror. At this time, all sounds disappeared, and it seemed that the entire universe had calmed down.</p>
<p>And the scenery at dusk is even more beautiful. The magnificent sunset dyed the distant mountains a pale purple and a gray-blue. If you are a painter, no matter how hard you try, you can't restrain your interest.</p>
<p>Travelers to Sun Moon Lake are reluctant to give up visiting the "Civilized Aborigine" tribes under Mount Shueshe. We took a small electric boat across the lake and landed in the tribal village on the opposite bank. The twenty-odd thatched huts of the aborigines sparkled milky yellow in the hot sun. When we arrived at the tribal village, thirty or forty aborigines had run over to welcome us. They were wearing Han Chinese clothes and spoke fluent Southern Min dialect. There was no trace of the original aborigines. But when we explained our intention to see the "Civilized Aborigine Pestle Song", a dozen young women immediately rushed home to change their clothes. Time passed, and they came out of their homes one after another, wearing the clothes they had worn since they were children. They wore deep blue, chest-high skirts, with colorful flower belts tightly fastened in front of their abdomens, light blue short jackets on their upper bodies, long-sleeved coats, and pearl circles on their heads, adorned with flowers, full of primitive flavor. Each person held an eight-foot-long wooden pestle in their hand, and the slightly older ones carried two-foot-long bamboo tubes, knocking out "dong, dong..." sounds.</p>
<p>The song and dance began. They constantly struck the stone slabs with wooden pestles, making "peng, peng" sounds, and added the sound of bamboo tubes, playing a unique and rustic melody. In the music, they performed dances similar to those of African natives, singing love songs that made us feel as if we had returned to primitive times.</p>
<h3>Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>The section of mountain road facing north in Longjing Village includes Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines. The so-called Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines are just nine streams and eighteen small streams. There is nothing special about them, but you don't know how rugged the mountain road is. On both sides are towering pointed peaks. On the rugged mountain road, there is a clear spring. Several stones protrude from the surface of the water, causing the flowing water to wrap around it in a rounded water pattern. When the flowing water runs over a natural stone slab, it will ruthlessly strike the stone slab, making a tinkling sound. Occasionally, a small bird flies over, chirping, and intertwining with the sound to form a quiet score like a "serenade". In the mountains, people are intoxicated in the spring scenery.</p>
<h3>Wolf Mountain is a famous scenic spot north of the Yangtze River and south of Nantong. Relying on the river and leaning on the mountain, it is worthy of being a beautiful place with water and mountains.</h3>

<h3>The Beauty of West Lake</h3>
<p>— Facing the Wall</p>
<p>I say that the beauty of West Lake is suitable for viewing from a distance, not for close-up inspection. Therefore, it is better to sit and watch than to take a deep tour. To appreciate its beauty, it is best to find a suitable place on the lake and sit down, and then leisurely look around. What is in front of you is like a natural painting. Surrounded by mountains and in a lake of blue waves. At this time, the mountains are not disgusted with their low height. Even bare mountains happen to form a faint backdrop. The water is not tired of its small size. If it were as large as Taihu Lake or Dongting Lake, it would not have such rippling beauty. In general, so-called beauty is a degree of gazing illusion. Furthermore, being enchanted by this illusion, one can enjoy a kind of pleasant feeling of beauty. If you examine it carefully, it is difficult to say that anything is beautiful. For example, a dilapidated temple. If you visit it with sincerity, you will surely be greatly disappointed and return. But if its location is just in the mountains and by the water, and there are some plants and trees outside, then if you look at it from a distance, you will see a mix of trees, revealing half-broken tiles and red walls, and a corner of a flying eave. At that time, you will not only not feel its dilapidation, but it will become a wonderful sight. I am not saying that everything in West Lake is broken down and worthless, that you cannot look at it closely, but only look at it vaguely from a distance and indulge in it yourself. Rather, I am saying that the beauty of the scenery is that it is suitable for viewing from a distance, and West Lake is one of them. But this is probably not something that those tourists who flock to crowded places can understand.</p>
<p>Peach blossoms and cherry blossoms have already faded, and "when the rose blooms, the spring is over". Another spring is about to pass. Returning from a lake tour and recording my feelings can be regarded as a small souvenir.</p>
<h3>Dwarf Cave</h3>
<p>— W.F.</p>
<p>During the spring break, I went to Hangzhou with a friend. Halfway up Mount Gao Feng on the way north, I suddenly discovered a small cave. There were three characters "Xiangshan Cave" in front of it. The entrance of the cave was very small and low. I bent down and entered. The cave was dark and without light. I groped forward and suddenly felt as if a monster was moving in the dark corner. Everyone was frightened and retreated. Only I was curious and struck a fire to shine on it. I found out that it was a dwarf. I asked him. He replied that his surname was Shen and he was fifty-seven years old. He came from Huizhou to live in the cave and had been there for more than half of his life. I saw that he was only three feet tall and had a burly physique, but his head was as big as a dipper, bald, and his appearance was very kind and amiable. Then he went out of the cave with me. We took a photo together in front of the cave (photo attached) to leave as a souvenir.</p>
<p>I think there are many people who travel to Hangzhou in the spring, but very few people know about this cave and this strange person. Therefore, I specially make this unexpected encounter public to those who love spring outings.</p>
<h3>Spring Outing Song</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Swallows murmur into the painted building, most of the spring scenery wants to return and rest. Even if the oriole calls people to stay, it is inevitable that the hair will easily turn white. My heart is heavy; my hatred is long. It is difficult to write a book that can eliminate poverty and sorrow; it is better to make an appointment with a companion to go out and find fragrance, the sun is bright and the wind is gentle, and to travel on the road. I can see the sights along the side of the Cheng River at will, emeralds and corals are all spring colors, tender willows droop their branches, buds are not yet stretched, and beautiful flowers fall to the ground, the buds are about to come out. By the stream, there is a graceful woman, with a jade appearance, full of charm and speechless; slender hands gently rub and wash the green gauze, and a graceful waist sways across the lotus pond. She turns her head and smiles as if beckoning, black hair scattered in the wind; red clouds fly onto her peach cheeks, and she walks slowly across the painted bridge. Several families worship wandering souls beside the graves, the flowing water sobs and the setting sun is dim! I am also too sentimental to bear it, and I secretly wipe away tears when I return.</p>
<h3>Scenic Spots of Mount Tuan</h3>
<p>— Yi Jin</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, if you mention spring outings, everyone will think of Jinshan, Jiaoshan, Beigushan, or the southern suburbs, because these are the "darlings" of the times and the "favorite guests" of the provincial capital.</p>
<p>"Mount Tuan", this name, perhaps some people will find it unfamiliar! Originally, he was not a well-known "beauty", but an unknown "hero" who had fallen in the countryside. He did not have the petite, graceful, gentle, and shy maiden state, nor had he undergone artificial makeup. The heroic, upright, bold, and unrestrained heroic posture is natural and the innate heroic nature.</p>
<p>In the eastern countryside of Zhenjiang, eight miles east of Dagang Town, the hometown of the martyr Zhao Boxian, is the location of Mount Tuan, forty-four miles from Zhenjiang City.</p>
<p>The towering and towering image of the Pengfeng Pagoda can be seen within a radius of tens of miles around, especially when the sun sets in the west and the sky is full of sunset clouds. The mountains reflect brilliant colors of purple, red, yellow, or green, and the rapid changes are even more spectacular.</p>
<p>From the foot of the mountain to the top, it is about three or four miles. The mountain is steep, and the stone steps wind upwards. The "Great Hero Hall", which originally stood majestically on the top of the mountain, was destroyed by enemy fire in the winter of the 26th year.</p>
<p>"Caves" are the only scenic spot of Mount Tuan. The main thing to do when visiting the mountain is to "visit the caves". According to local legend: "There are a total of seventy-two stone caves of all sizes on the mountain." Although this statement has not been verified, there are indeed twenty or thirty stone caves worth seeing, and these many caves are all naturally formed and rarely artificially decorated. In each cave or to the left and right of the cave, there is a small nunnery for tourists to rest and dine.</p>
<p>The most amazing one is the "Arrow Cave". The cave is pierced in the thick stone wall on the mountainside, forming a circle with a diameter of more than ten feet. From the south of the mountain, you can see through to the north of the mountain. It is truly a different world. It is said that this cave was pierced by Liu Bowen with an arrow in the past, hence the name.</p>
<p>The largest one is the "Immortal Cave", which is the size of three large houses, rectangular in shape, and about thirty feet high. The surrounding stone walls stand upright. When people are in the cave, they look up and see strange rocks towering and hanging in mid-air, making people feel shocked and sigh.</p>
<p>"Peach Immortal Cave" is the most beautiful. A small building is built outside the cave. Inside the cave, there is a clear spring, clear and bright. Peach trees are planted in the surrounding slopes, and the peach blossoms are in full bloom in March of late spring, charming, neat, and brilliant, simply a pink world.</p>
<p>"Guanyin Cave" is the deepest and longest, with a Guanyin Hall, a pavilion, a kitchen, and a bedroom inside.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Bat Cave, White Pigeon Cave, Crab Cave, White Dragon Cave, Lu Xian Cave, Snail Cave, Tobacco Pouch Cave, Purse Cave..., some are deep, some are winding, some are protruding, and some are bizarre..., all of which are enough to make people enjoy visiting and sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>The annual Huangming has arrived, and the men and women of the surrounding villages and towns will go to admire the heroic posture and broaden their horizons again.</p>
<h3>Mochou Lake and Yanzi Rock</h3>
<p>— Mustard Spring</p>
<p>Around the Grain Rain Festival, walk out of the Shuixi Gate, away from the noisy city, and see people by the water letting out ducks, and patches of vegetable fields paved with golden flowers. After walking through the villages, buildings and pavilions are hidden among the trees, and the spring water is uneven. We have approached the shore of Mochou Lake.</p>
<p>Walking along the banks of the lake, you come to the Huayan Nunnery. Behind the nunnery is the Shengji Building. It is said that Emperor Taizu of Ming once gambled with Prince Zhongshan Xu Da here. His Majesty lost the bet and gave the lake products to the Xu family, hence the name. The building houses a portrait of a national hero who recovered the territory, and his heroic posture is still imaginable. The couplets on both sides are like pearls and full of beautiful words.</p>
<p>Behind the building is the former site of the Yu Jin Hall, where the statue of Lu Mochou is enshrined. The four characters "Is it or not" are inscribed on the horizontal plaque. The story of Mochou has been circulated among the people and passed down from generation to generation. Mo Chou is one, so there is no need to cling to the zither and examine her origin and history.</p>
<p>In this quiet Yujin Hall, overlooking the railing and facing the stream, reeds are sprouting green and spring water is rising. Swimming fish are connected and their appearances can be counted. To the east is Stone City, with mountains winding around and majestic palaces. Marquis Wu Xiang wrote: "Zhongyu is like a dragon, and Stone City is like a tiger." This is a faithful introduction. Looking around, Qingliang Mountain, Zhongfu Mountain, and Lulong Mountain are connected in front of you, remotely connected to some mountain peaks north of the Yangtze River. The water is a piece of blue, and the mountains are a horizontal stroke of black. Xuanwu Lake has never had this kind of scenery!</p>
<p>When the setting sun hangs on the mountain, walk down the Shengji Building and look back. The Qingliang Gate of Stone City is already dimly lit, and the lights are dim. The new moon rises, and the lake is covered in smoke. The weeping willows flutter in the evening breeze, with another kind of melancholy meaning. I can't help but chant the couplet on the building: "What about peerless heroes? The prime minister only leaves a portrait; indulging in a lake of wind and moon, Mochou is truly a good person to worry"!</p>
<p>— Mustard</p>
<p>In the past few days, tourists from all over the world have flocked to Hangzhou, and the lake is even more like a carnival. However, we, who live in paradise, want to go to other places for a spring outing. It just so happened that we had an opportunity to visit the capital. Nanjing was originally a place for old tours, and most of the scenic spots in the suburbs have already been admired. This time, we have another trip to Yanzi Rock.</p>
<p>Taking a car over Coal Port and turning to Shangyuan Village, there is a different kind of scenery. The narrow and winding stone road is hidden high and low. On the right are stone cliffs that stretch continuously, and on the left, the Yangtze River is like a sash, with fertile fields. Although the car is moving fast, it shows its twists and turns. It looks like "the mountains and rivers are exhausted", but as you go, "the road turns and the peaks change". This mountain path alone is enough to make you praise it.</p>
<p>Parking is quite spacious inside the Santai Cave. The water dripping from the cave has accumulated into a shallow pool, clear and crystal clear, which can cleanse the mind. There is nothing to see in the Ertai Cave. In the Toutai Cave, there are many more myths, such as "Dragon Head and Dragon Mouth" and "Rhinoceros Gazing at the Sun". These are all stories of the cave stones resembling shapes.</p>
<p>Yanzi Rock, like other mountain peaks, climbs up level by level, but there are still strange and steep peaks on top. Standing on it and looking down, the Yangtze River is surging, washing away many heroes. Moreover, this is also a good final destination for general misanthropes. The "Think About It" stele will call on people to "rein in at the edge of the cliff", but who is willing to "drift with the tide"? "Isn't it just forced by the environment".</p>
<p>After walking down the mountain, hire a small boat and row to the river in front of the mountain to admire the true face of "Yanzi". I only feel that it is steep and rugged, and the cliffs are like flying swallows. If it were to be inserted higher into the clouds, it would be even more amazing. Returning to Guanyin Pavilion, after the guidance of the old Taoist, I saw an iron chain hanging down from the mountainside, only a foot long. He said that it was used in the Ming Dynasty to lock the Yangtze River and tie up boats. Regardless of the truth, the river water at that time undoubtedly reached halfway up the mountain. The sea has changed and the mulberry fields have changed several times. Sit down and chat with an old white-haired woman who is ninety-one years old about the mountain life. At such a great age, she can still grind ink with one hand and talk and laugh freely. Asking her about the price of food, she is completely unaware, and she casually answers with a few tens of coppers per liter. It really feels like "I don't know there is Han".</p>
<p>Returning, speeding through the verdant winding path is a wonderful living environment.</p>

<h3>Recommendation of "A Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance"</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>Wang Shiying is one of the pioneers of China's cooperative movement. For twenty years, he has been wholeheartedly devoted to the promotion of the cooperative movement, especially the agricultural finance sector, in which he has taken a special interest and paid special attention. During the Anti-Japanese War, he taught agricultural finance in various universities. In 1939, when he was in Chongqing, he compiled a "Outline of Agricultural Finance", which was printed in 300 copies for the reference of students at the Cooperative College of the Central Political School. In 1941, he compiled a "Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance", which was divided into six chapters. The style took theory as the warp and examples from various countries as the weft. It described all aspects of agricultural credit in detail. The first edition was limited and had long been sold out. Recently, it was reprinted by the "China Book and Stationery Production Cooperative", with three articles appended, such as "The Mission of Agricultural Finance", which are powerful works that elaborate on agricultural finance.</p>
<p>The author believes that "China's economic construction must attach equal importance to industry and agriculture, and the establishment of an agricultural financial system is particularly crucial among the new facilities for agricultural construction", and that "the promotion of cooperative undertakings also relies heavily on agricultural finance".</p>
<p>He also believes that "the agricultural finance problem is by no means simply a problem of relief for farmers' lives, nor is it a problem caused by agriculture being on the verge of bankruptcy. The agricultural finance problem is a constant problem for a country in a normal situation".</p>
<p>This view is naturally extremely correct. This is theory, but it is also fact. He is now the director of the Cooperative Affairs Bureau. When he recently came to Shanghai, he mentioned that he is now implementing the theory; he is working hard on rural financial facilities; however, he also sighed that he is afraid that he will not be able to see the seeds blossom and bear fruit. From his words, it can be seen how enthusiastic he is about cooperativism, and how deep his intention is to focus his attention on the countryside and improve rural life.</p>
<p>My purpose in recommending this "Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance" is not just to encourage everyone to read this book. I hope that those who read this book can also be like the author, broaden their horizons and truly pay attention to the tasks we should shoulder.</p>
