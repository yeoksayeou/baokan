<h3>國民大會著手籌備　經費槪算原則決定　籌備委會通過工作綱要</h3>
<p>「本報南京廿七日電」國大籌備委會廿七日宣吿成立，同日上午十一時舉行首次會，主委孫科主席，副主委張繼，曾琦，徐傅霖，莫德惠，委員吳鼎昌，吳鐵城，邵力子，雷震等均出席，討論通過谷案如次：甲，籌委會秘書，招待，警衛等處組織規程，乙，大會經費槪算原則，丙，籌備工作綱要。</p>
<p>「又電」國大籌備工作綱要，業經國大籌委會廿七日通過，其要點如次：</p>
<p>甲，關於大會會場及一切房舍之佈置者　　會塲利用已有設備，以荘嚴美觀，力求節約爲準。　代表休息室，於會場左側搭建樓房一幢。　辦公室亦在左側廣場興建。</p>
<p>乙，關於大會代表之招待交際者　　代表報到，即在招待處設報到組。　代表膳食代金，每日以十萬至十五萬元爲準。　代表住宿，以租用市內大建築及控制一部份旅館，不住者給宿費，每日十五萬至廿五萬元。　代表交通所需大客車八十輛至一百輛，向交部公路總局及汽車公司租用小汽車卅輛，車場另行尋覓，油料先向上海石汕公司訂購。　代表之接待，各地分設接待站，商請交部頒所屬運輸機關予以優先購票之　利。</p>
<p>丙，關於開會及議事者　大會各種法規，均事先分別擬具草案或訂定辦法備用。</p>
<p>丁，關於大會警衛者　參照去年實際情形，另行規劃。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國大經費支出，籌委會廿七日已決定，其原則以一個月爲準，計：　代表招待費共佔總額百分之五十六，其中包括旅費百分十九，公費百分之六，宿費百分之九，膳費百分之七，招待站用費百分之八，特別費百分之七。　設備費佔總額百分之廿二，其中包括會常設備費百分之五，膳商設備費百分之九，交通設備費百分之八，　議事費佔總額百分之十四，　事務費佔總額百分之八·按本屆代表三〇三九人，較上屆大會增加百分之八十，舟車機票價較去年增加百分之二千以上，膳宿雜費增加百分之一千五百左右，如以人數平均計，上次每人招待費爲二百六十萬元，此次即應爲二千一百萬元，惟以本屆大會會期較短，故所增不多。關於設備方面，除去年原設備儘量利用外，尙須增加食宿設備，建築能容納二千人之休息室，加關停車塲，租用客車等。</p>

<h3>兩黨立委候選人人選配合待續商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕民·靑兩黨立委候選人名單，廿七日商討尙未獲最後結論，故未能提交選總公布，惟目前對地區分配之原則已獲致協議，今竟日由國民黨及民·靑兩黨分別舉行中常會，所討論者僅爲人選之配合，故可能於廿八日完成此項工作，而提選總公布。</p>

<h3>對暹羅現政府我態度考慮中　暹使不理免職令</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕暹大使杜拉勒被暹國新政府免職消息傳抵此間後，各方均極注意，記者羣尤集中硯綫於我外部之表示，然迄至記者發電時止，猶渺無消息。唯據確息，此事已在王外長之愼密考慮中。杜拉勒於報端得悉其爲現政府外部宣布免職後，語本報記者稱：渠尙未接獲曼谷之通知，然早在渠明示其不服從現政府法令之際，已料到此項結果。杜氏笑指其放置全權證書之銀盒稱：「余全權證書猶在此，爲中國政府承認而接受者，倘一且中國政府承認暹羅現政府，余自常歸國返回田園，在此之前，余將置之不理，繼續執行職務」。杜氏對現政府是否可能獲得各國承認一點，婉拒答覆，僅笑謂：「此可觀諸彼等派赴碧瑤出席聯合國亞洲及遠東經委會之代表所受待遇，無論如何，現政府之出現，乃仗持武力而非合法者」</p>
<h3>顧維鈞演說　美應重視我國局勢</h3>
<p>「本報訊」紐約廿七日廣播：華感頓訊，今日爲感恩節，中國駐聯合國代表顧維鈞在哥侖比亞廣播公司發表十五分鐘之廣播演說，力主美國應根據馬歇爾計劃重視中國局勢，並迅速予以援助。顧氏云：馬歇爾計劃對於世界之復興具有重大意義，中國及遠東亦爲需要此種援助之地區之一，良以中國不惟需要重建經濟，抑且刻正面臨共產勢力擴張之威脅故也。顧氏對聯合國機構，仍抱樂觀態度，認爲此一機構乃第二次大戰後唯一之重大收穫，並信一俟國際警衛軍成立後，即能負起維護世界和平之責任。</p>
<h3>遠經委會陷僵局暹代表拂袖而去　委會已允許暹羅入會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社碧瑤廿七日電〕遠東經濟委員會二十七日已允許暹羅加入爲會員，然暹代表兩人稱，彼等已堅決定奪乘機返國。委員會二十六日辦論暹羅入會事，歷時二小時半，惟未獲決議。暹代表稱，彼等對此拖延，感覺「煩惱」。廿七日中午散會時間，執行秘書洛加納桑急電羅幹飛機塲，勸令暹代表停止出發，並稱「暹羅已可參加」，惟暹方代表稱已決定，返國後不能挽回。菲代表瓜德吿合衆社稱，已致電暹駐馬尼刺領事潘金斯，作最後努力，以促使暹代表重返碧瑤。渠稱菲代表團希望盤谷將改變其訓令。美代表建議允暹羅參加，英國予以補充謂，允其參加並非「委員會各國承認暹羅政府之任何步驟」。英美建議以八對一票通過，法國棄權，蘇聯反對。</p>
<h3>部份外銷物品政院准暫內銷</h3>
<p>「中央社南京廿七日電」部份外銷物品，現經政院核准，暫可內銷運輸，其中如猪　·羽毛·腸衣·山羊皮·五倍子·桐油·苧蔴·生絲·廢絲等外銷物品，經粤漢鐵路內運武昌至郴縣間各地，刻經政院核准暫予內運銷售，但託運商人須取具託運鐵路車站所在地商會正式證明書，證明該項物品係運至國內何地，作何項用途，並保證非運轍出口，證明書送由鐵路車站站長査騐相符，始可裝運。</p>
<h3>六千萬元援華案美國會即可通過</h3>
<p>「中央社華盛頓廿六日電」衆院外委會建議在義。法，奧緊急援助計劃中，列入對華六千萬元援助一節，僉信可於國會中通過，如參衆兩院按照原定步驟進行討論，則對華救濟基金當可在十二月中旬國會特別會議就對外緊急援助問題完成工作時進行表決。六千萬元援華款項使用期間，至明年三月爲止，而國務院三億元計劃，則爲明年四月起至一九四九年六月爲止，十五個月之援助費用。支持對華緊急援助之人士並不奢望，此六千萬美元即可使南京方面擊敗共產黨，亦未認爲該款可使中國渡過目前之經濟危機，但渠等堅決相信，此爲國會首次撥款援華，而凡事如經開始，則不論如何渺小，終較不開始爲佳。另悉：衆院委會在對此項援助採取行動之前，美西北大學政治科學敎授麥克哥文曾向該會議員警吿稱：美國對華援助極爲必要，渠曰美國之援助，可向中國人民保證渠等對抗共產黨之爭鬥，有美國人民爲其後盾，中國需要十億至十五億美元，並需若干年月始能恢復其經濟。麥氏敦促即以六千萬至七千萬元之緊急援助畀予中國。並謂：此款對「恢復中國之信心民氣以及使中國樂於自助，均將有無比影響」。麥氏復建議此項臨時援助最大用於「穩定通貨」。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>申論開放內河航權之不當</h3>
<p>— 程學江</p>
<p>英文大陸報曾以「長江航運」爲題，主張開放內河航權。其所持理由：　暫准外國船隻行駛長江，上游運費可以减低，實有助於對外輸出；　內河航權開放以後，英國航商固蒙其利，中國經濟之得益尤爲明顯：　外國政府如以武力要求開放內河航權，固是侵犯主權，若由中國政府自動邀請，則又當別論。其結論則謂中國政府爲整個經濟利益着想，應卽允准外國船隻行駛內河，否則徒使少數航商獨佔壟斷，於國家毫無所補云云。</p>
<p>吾人細釋大陸報之意，不啻爲英國航商張目；其時英議會訪華團所表示之意見，企圖重享我國內河航權。但其所持理由，實極膚淺。如所謂暫准外國船隻通航內河無損國家主權，又謂非以外國武力要求而由中國自動邀請，不能視爲侵犯主權。須知主權之爲物，至可珍貴而不容斷送；如果斷送，豈得謂爲無損？又豈得謂爲無所侵犯？至謂外國船隻行駛內河以後，上游渾費可以减低，對外輸出得以增進，此亦似是而非之談。緣外國船隻行駛內河，同樣要燃料消耗，要修理折舊，要員工開支，要管理費用，要繳納捐稅。旣稱「英國航商固蒙其利」，可知並未脫離營利範圍，卽未必能獨减運費。今英船之往返港滬者，初不聞其運費低於華商，此其鐵證。卽使英船爲競爭長江航業，貶價承運，其有益於輸出土產者少，而有害於整個國家經濟者大。爲什麽呢？因爲運費無論低廉至如何程度，吾人所支出的，即爲英商所用以換取之外匯。夫外匯頭寸之支絀，人所盡知，今之進出口貨物，率由外船承運，因而增加外匯之支出，已屬憾事，乃幷此內河運費而亦須以外匯支出，此豈國家之利？且英商蓄謀甚深，可以過去事實爲蹬。當招商局創立之初，本以運漕爲唯一業務，旋以購併旗昌洋行之全部產業，其業務駸駸日上，大爲英商所忌。卽濫用貶價手段，肆其壓迫。爾時如非李鴻章全力維護，而祗打减輕運費的小算盤，則此漕運業務，亦幾爲英商所奪。又在昔外商在華享有內河航權時代，英商之怡和太古兩公司，曾創運費公攤制度（Freight　Pool）與長江下游航運會議（Lower　Yangize　Shipping　Conferrence），對於華商之滲加，限制綦嚴。其未能參加者：胥被打倒。坐是之故，華商航業，迄難發展。覆轍猶在，尤不能不引以爲戒。</p>
<p>至吾國目前輸出之不暢，自係事實。顧其因素甚多，決不能完全歸咎於運費，尤不能完全歸咎於內河之運費。今內地外銷之土產，無人過問者茶多，上海各倉庫中滿儲之外銷土產，無法出口者尤多。在國內外物價距離尙遠，各國限制進口的幅度尙未放寬以前，欲求促進出口，確非易事。其在航運方面，所惜今日尙缺少大型船隻，可以開闢遠洋航綫，藉以節省運費之外滙支出，此則吾人所當共同致力者耳。</p>
<p>所謂獨佔壟斷云者，原指某一業務僅准由某一專業機關獨家辦理之謂。中國航業，今已有一百餘家之多，凡是中國國民，均有組設公司航行國內之權利；國營招商局與民營航業有其同樣之權利與義務，非若昔日英商之航行我國內河者，祗享航行之權利而無應徵之義務可比。故就整個航業言，任何一家，均談不上獨佔與壟斷。若謂凡百事業，非有外商參加，卽難免獨佔襲斷，則吾國之郵政與鹽務，亦將供諸外商同享其利，而後可謂之不獨占不壟斷嗎？</p>
<p>若謂中國航商以無外商競爭故，遂得任意抬高運價，此亦不明事理之談。蓋航運爲公用事業之一，凡客票與運資之增减，均受交通當局之核定。交通當局雖依照航業對於燃料·薪給·修繕·利息種種之支出，而時時爲合理之調整，但以時間性之調整，究不若幣値柢落與其他物價增漲之迅速，故熟識航業內容者，莫不知今日航商處境之困難，又外商亦有在上海經營公用事業者，其費率且屢爲調整。他們倒眞是獨佔營業者，其亦可視爲壟斷否？</p>
<p>吾國航業受不平等條約之覊束以致不能自振，歷年已久。今內河航權甫經收復，航業甫呈轉機，凡我國人，自應策勵鼓吹，以期急起直追。所望大家正視事實，發揮正論，使尙在萌芽之中國航業，不再遭受摧殘，則不獨中國航業之幸了。</p>
<h3>農業學術團體聯合年會　主席訓詞原文</h3>
<p>（上接一版）</p>

<h3>魯境國軍鹵獲重要文件　共匪幹部一封信（續）　對上級坦述軍心已渙散</h3>
<p>悲觀：大部參軍戰士，低　頭不啃氣，不吃飯。有的到處找老鄕，看見家裘人傷亡了，就號陶大哭，或一天到晚死睡，有偶參軍戰士哭着說：「只剩我一個了，不知何時死？老鄕的死屍也回不到家，眞可憐！」一部份老戰士就大吃大喝，一個班長說：「這個年頭不吃，還不知那天死？」解放戰士中對反攻不信我們能勝利。他們說：「消滅二六師，又來一個二六師，消滅七十二師，又來個七十二師，國軍永久打不了，人家又有美國人接濟，配備是越來越好，」又說：「共產黨根本打不過中失，過去泰安是碰巧了！」因此，新解放的戰士，紛紛逃亡。八師廿二國一夜走了一百二十多，這還不算，特務份子又從中鼓動，個別的就掮了機槍逃跑。</p>
<p>鬆懈：幹部對逃亡掉隊遠反紀律等發生問題都不管了。一個排長說：「當個班長，帶二三個兵，行軍時一小節，眞不起勁。」二十六團三運亂抓民伕挑背包，幹部不管，廿七團有一政委楊洪輝也竟大呌大哭，不問工作。</p>
<p>等待整編；到處打聽消息，打報吿，這幾種情緖是普遍的。在幹部中的「保命思想」也發展起來了，裝病，要求休養的就有六七個。九師（全部）中計有營級二個，連級三個，排級二個（政工人員三個），……四縱隊從魯南到此後，才透過了一口氣，但思想上很混亂：第一是表現左右傾的情緖，如一個排長說：「打不死，跑死，跑不死，饑死，」卅一團四運有十七個俘虜有組織逃跑，帶了十枝槍，内有黨員二人。其次是時局模糊，不相信劉鄧（按指劉伯承鄧小平鄧係劉部之政委）大軍的勝利，說：「反攻反攻，丟了山東；」這地區不大，西北邊有黃河，東邊有運河，南邊隴海路，敵人合擊吃不消，勝利了（按係反話）我們人少了，槍丟了，轉到人家地區來了。三縱隊攻城有辦法，濟寗也未打下，到處是槍砲聲，敵人後面窮迫，我們是「逃亡縱隊」了！第卅二團的紀律壞透了，表現在（甲）打罵地方幹部；（乙）亂要糧草民伕；（丙）强買東西，强拉牲口；〔丁）個別强姦婦女；地方政權幹部，看到南方部隊就跑，老百姓也躲避。賴少奇同志來信說：「我們的紀律太壞了！政治工作沒辦法，宣傳工作做完了，現在只好用殺頭來維持。……陳軍長（按指陳毅）千算萬算，就是糧食沒算，沒鞋子走路……於是陣中因爲丟了東西，一天到晚留　過去的東西，可惜嘆氣的很多。另外部隊裏打駡很厲害，卅二團除正副政委及三營政敎外，其餘全部都打了，七運戰士的反映：下次通長再打人，我們就他媽的跑。</p>
<p>現在團以上的幹部，有一個明確的要求，便是「補充休整「，事實上，這樣再打下去也非垮不行。</p>
<p>……敵從的飛機又來了，槍聲起了！就此住筆。並致敬禮。職汪大年十三日。（完）（特派員　天廿四日寄）</p>

<h3>四外長開始討論德和約　疆界問題將起爭執　外長代表研討奧地利問題</h3>
<p>「本報訊」倫敦廿七日廣播：今日下午外長會議將舉行第三次會議，由馬歇爾任主席。馬氏將迫使莫洛托夫討論德國疆界問題，而尤重視德波之疆界。按莫洛托夫昨曾就德國和約問題發表意見，主張迅速簽訂對德和約，並成立强有力之德國中央政府，以代替目下之四强軍政府，其目的顯欲討好德國人民，作爲一種宣傳攻勢。馬歇爾之所以將提出疆界問題，乃欲予蘇聯之宣傳以打擊也。猶如衆所共知者，蘇聯堅主根據彼茨坦協定確立德波　界，此點顯爲德國人民所不滿。且蘇聯對薩爾區之併入法國亦表反對，不贊成德國西境發生任何變更。馬歇爾提出疆界問題後，蘇聯將被迫就比一棘手問題，闡明立場矣。</p>
<p>「合衆社倫敦廿七日電」蘇聯之遲遲而後同意英美之加速對德和約之討論，在外長會議中造成審愼之樂觀空氣，即使對蘇聯動機取最懷疑之態度者，亦均承認莫洛托夫之公開表示應從速考慮對德和約，實爲一大進步，此爲蘇聯對德政策之一轉變。</p>
<p>法外長皮杜爾準備在今日集會中，提出爆炸性之德國西境問題，並將再度堅持四强須同意薩爾之屬於法國。在邊境問題之爭辯中，可能顯示蘇聯爲求取對德和約早日締結，願作何種讓步。蘇聯一向堅持應參預魯爾區之管制，此點英美拒絕接受，然又反對法國之建議，即將魯爾自德國分離而由國際管理。在德國邊境問題討諭中，法國可能支持蘇聯，必欲改變波茨坦之諒解，英美則欲將奧達與尼斯河以東之若千農業區歸還德國。</p>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿六日電」四國外長會議關於奧國問題之優局，巳於今日打開，現已商定將奧國問題列爲議程之第一項。四外長於略加討論後，已商定議程次序如下：　英美法三國提議之對奧和約：　對德和約，包括程序及疆界問題；　德國將來之經濟原則；　德國臨時政府之形式與範　；　檢討莫斯科會議所決定之解除武裝辦法之實施情形；　美國所提議之四强防德公約。奧國問題已交四外長特派代表加以討諭，各外長所任命之代表如下：美國道奇，英國馬約里彭克斯，法國契里爾將軍，蘇聯柯克托莫夫。</p>
<p>「聯合社倫敦廿六日電」四國外長會議今日曾一度發生論戰。蘇外長莫洛托夫指責西方各國阻碍德國和約之締結，擬以帝國主義奴化弱小民族，並擬操縱德國經濟，以培養其軍事潛勢力。英外長貝文答稱，「吾人顯然均爲戰爭販子，全世界之聖人，唯有蘇聯而已。」法外長皮杜爾稱，莫氏之言恐於和諧無補。美國務卿馬歇爾亦以短辭答覆稱，「莫氏之言恐其本人亦不相信。吾人最好實是求是，不再以君子之心，度小人之腹，此不過宣傳之枝節。吾人須以合理的態度立即開始工作，爲全世界之福利成立協定。」會議第二日之開場白至此於是吿終。</p>
<h3>比荷盧提備忘錄　德國問題與各該國利害攸關　未經同意四强勿作任何決定</h3>
<p>「中央社倫敦廿六日電」比荷盧三國本日向四外長會議提出聯合備忘錄，表示三國對德政治及經濟前途之意見，三國政府强調德國問題之一般解決及魯爾問題之特別解決，如未經比荷臘同意，四外長會議不應作任何決定。備忘錄中强調防止使用德經濟力量，以威脅歐洲政治均衡之重要性，並建議兩項主要方略，即魯爾工業區之國際管制，與在聯邦憲法範圍內逐漸恢復德人之政治責任。三國政府要求參加魯爾，工業區國際管制之權，並要求在國際共管德國之時期內有列席權。三國政府重視三國之安全，免受德國未來可能之侵略，但經濟上除典型破壞性之機械及原料外，又不願見德國經濟能力之大量　減。</p>
<h3>奧人民表示欣慰</h3>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿七日電」四外長會議將對奧和約列於議程第一項後，奧國各地已瀰漫樂觀之空氣。人民黨機關報視爲奧國與全世界之曙光，因此項發展，證明雙方均有妥協之意　。</p>
<h3>德共擬推選代表對和約陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿七日電〕共黨操縱之社會統一黨頃宜佈：「人民大會」將於十二月六七兩日舉行會議，以選舉代表出席倫敦外長會議代表德國。該黨領袖在記者招待會中稱，代表擬要求四國外長在倫敦會議結束前，允許彼等出席，彼等要求德國各黨之支持。</p>
<h3>美對英貨款餘額短期內難望解凍</h3>
<p>「合衆社華盛頓廿六日電」美財政部長史奈據稱：美國是否將英國貸款之差額解凍，此事在數週內仍無決定可能。某記者稱有消息，謂非至國會解決緊急援歐問題後，對此問題將一無動作，是否屬實？史氏拒絕表示。</p>
<p>「合衆社倫敦廿六日電」英財相克里浦斯廿六日　實，英希　不久以後，即能支取英美貸款中所剩之最後四億美元。但　稱此事須待美國首先有表示。</p>
<h3>英下院通過錫蘭獨立案</h3>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿六日電」英下議院已通過錫蘭獨立案，送交上議院，該案規定錫蘭在不列顚聯邦內獲得自治領之地位。</p>
<h3>美參議院拒絕削減援歐款項</h3>
<p>「本報訊」紐約廿七日廣播：華盛頓訊，美參院昨日拒絕將對法義奧三國之緊急援助削减一億九千七百萬美元，但亦有一部議員反對隨便以援助給予外國，而提出種種修正案，因此在感恩節作最後表決之希望，終吿落空。</p>
<h3>法工潮日趨擴大　工人拒絕政府加薪辦法盛傳共黨企圖發動政變</h3>
<p>「聯合社巴黎廿七日電」許曼總理定於今日午後向議會報吿處置工潮辦法，請求核准，惟預定發言者甚多，今日能否舉行表決，尙不可知。</p>
<p>「聯合社巴黎廿六日電」法國罷工工人今日已近二百萬，各地曾有零星暴動。煤礦罷工中心點列里北部，及法國東部若干地點，罷工者與不罷工者曾發生爭鬥。鐵路總罷工已在進行中。安納西省阿爾平鎮之總工會支部已號召該區會員全體罷工，此爲各工會聯合總罷工之見端。許曼總理曾用無綫電廣播，向罷工者呼籲復工，稱現値法國歷史上之困苦時期，請各工人自問良心。並稱罷工者在罷工時間內不給工資，並謂此次罷工，由於政治目的者頗多。許氏對巴黎罷工人員，允立即暫時增加每月一千五百法郞（約合美金十二元），以應付生活費之高漲，罷工者則要求最低工資每月增加三十二美元。總工會所屬十八工會，對政府提議立即予以拒絕，尙有二十一工會須開會決定是否接受條件，或加入罷工。</p>
<p>「合衆社巴黎廿六日電」法國里昂城罷工工人廿六日舉行大示威，被警察以催淚性瓦斯驅散。全國盛傳共黨計劃利用工潮作爲掌政之跳板，傳法常備軍三萬人已在上週內自德境及北非召回本國，駐屯於巴黎，馬賽，列里，里昂及其他紛擾中心。傳萊因區軍隊已準備立即出動，導境守衛隊封鎖法西，法義邊境，以防新「國際隊伍」滲透之可能。美大使賈斐禮廿六日下午五時訪許曼於總理辦事處，許氏之値日官稱此爲「通常之訪問，並無政治重要性」。</p>
<h3>法蘇締易貨協定　蘇聯將以大宗穀物運法</h3>
<p>「合衆肚巴黎廿六日電」法外交部廿六日宣佈，法蘇在莫斯科簽訂協定，根據該協定，蘇聯將以二萬五千噸　物，交換法國之製造品。法外交部稱：該協定規定由蘇運法之　物，主要爲小要，至於法國對蘇之出口貨物，大部分皆爲紡織品及顏料。此項談判業已進行達數週之久，並將繼續進行，希望能達成更進一步之協定。</p>
<h3>英儲君夫婦　答謝各方道賀　起程赴蘇格蘭渡蜜月</h3>
<p>「路透社倫教廿六日電」伊麗莎白公主與愛丁堡公爵於今晨離開漢浦郡之羅姆賽，在白金漢宮進午餐，巳於今夜乘火車赴蘇格蘭。擬赴英王別　渡過蜜月。公主夫婦於啓程前發表答謝祝賀大婚禮之函件，略稱：英國與全世界祝賀大婚之人士，對渠等表示關切，渠等將永誌不忘，特此表示謝意。該函署名爲「伊麗莎白與斐利浦」。</p>
<h3>澳總理反對向美國舉債</h3>
<p>「合衆社鹿白拉廿七日電」齊甫萊總理稱：渠反對在任何條件下向美國舉債，以彌補國內美元之缺乏，蓋如此可能增加澳洲將來之困難。渠稱內閣已決定再度削减美元支出，包括重新限制進口等措施。</p>
<h3>杜魯門反通貨膨脹措施　共和黨仍表反對　馬丁表示將重提減稅案</h3>
<p>「聯合社紐約廿六日電」「馬歇爾計劃之戰」於本月十七日在國會展開以來，其陣容已甚明顯，即此案乃加強政府管制與减少政府管制之爭。</p>
<p>今看共和黨控制之國會以相當的優勢，結束各種經濟與商業統制，民主黨政府反對無效，問題已吿一段落；但經濟顧問委員會向杜魯門總統提出之掃吿書中，又舊事重提。該報吿書所提之統制辦法中，包括國內與國外應用物品之分配制止投機，以及全盤防止通貨膨脹措施，以抵消極度需要之壓迫，其法爲繼續推行重稅，减少或擴大信用貸款等。其中一部分措施，即共和黨國會上屆會議中所廢止者。共和黨人仍在爭取其他管制之解除，以減低個人所得稅爲主要目標。上屆會議中杜魯門曾兩次援用否決權加以打消，但衆議院議長馬丁（共和黨員）昨稱：减稅法案將於一九四八年六月國會休會前通過。</p>
<h3>日地下政府事件政府將提出報吿</h3>
<p>「新亞社東京廿七日電」關於倫敦電訊所傳之日本地下政府問題，日參議院於廿六日大會中曾有緊急動議，要求政府說明眞象，政府方面因調査關係，允於廿八日大會中提出報吿。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹特別委會　薛光前任我代表</h3>

<h3>林平馬被整肅　後任人選由蘆田決定</h3>
<p>〔新亞社柬京廿七日電〕中央公職審查委員會，正式決定前國務相林平馬應予整肅。林本人對此僅謂「余不以本人之言行爲恥」，幷表示不願多語。</p>
<p>「新亞社東京廿七日電」片山首相對林國務相之後任人選，完全聽任民主黨總裁蘆田自行決定，在一兩日中可望揭曉。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦分治計劃　聯大會遭遇阻力　展期至今日作最後表決</h3>
<p>「合衆社弗魯辛廿六日電」分治巴勒斯坦之建議，今日在聯大會中遭遇新的反對。在進退維谷之情形下，分治計劃之擁護者卒促使大會將最後表決延展至廿八日舉行。同時分裂聖地爲阿猶兩邦之計劃已接近實現，蓋荷蘭及紐西蘭宣佈將不再採取棄權之態度而擬投票予以擁護。荷蘭態度之改變，將使比盧兩國採取相同立塲。</p>
<p>同時紐西蘭代表貝朗森於會議後宣佈，爲促進和諧計，將改變立場而投贊成票，但海地希臘及菲律賓同時宣佈將投反對票。如荷比蘆一致贊成分治，聯大以三分之二多數通過分治案殆成定局。延期表決之決定，係在雙方在會外壓迫騎牆代表團之結果。惟大會中局勢時時改觀，至今廿八國宣稱將支持分治，十五國宣佈將投反對票。大會於廿八日表決前，將有十一國代表發表演說。</p>
<h3>我闡明立場</h3>
<p>「中央社南京廿七日電」外部發言人今晚對記者發表談話：「關於聯大對巴勒斯坦問題，中國政府之政策，自始以來爲其代表團應支持在原則上能爲爭執之雙方所能接受之任何建議，對於足以引起再度之嚴重爭鬥及流血之任何計劃，則不予以支持。中國代表國如不因對猶太人之願望特別關切，則對分治計劃勢將予以反對。因此之故，中國代表團已奉令放棄關於此問題之投票權，但亦不擬投反對票。」</p>
<h3>暹羅玉佛鑽石失竊</h3>
<p>「聯合社曼谷廿六日電」　羅政　以來，今日又發生一驚人事件，著名古佛頭額所嵌三克拉鑽石，已吿失竊。該佛用綠玉彫成，身披價値十萬美元之珠衣，藏在王宮神廟內。警察局據王宮方面報吿後，即秘密搜査，曾捕獲廟內衛兵六名，旋即　放其三。</p>
<h3>鑾披汶表示　願保持中暹友好</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿五日電〕鑾披汶昨向往訪之我七僑胞會館代表稱，渠已年邁，對政治已不感興趣。渠並表示，暹羅將不施職業限制法，且請僑胞盡棄舊嫌。鑾氏復稱，中暹人民保持密切合作，乃暹羅獲致經濟繁榮之唯一途徑。渠並論及華僑人力之價値問題稱，若干土地將分配予新入暹境之中國人民，渠等可在此大地上自由從農業工作。</p>
<h3>蒙巴頓使美不確</h3>
<p>「合衆社倫敦廿六日電」英政府高級官員方面稱，外傳印督蒙巴頓可能任英駐美大使，係屬完全無稽。渠稱，英國現並不擬更迭駐美大使。</p>
<h3>美商長要求資助民航業</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿六日電〕美商業部長哈里曼廿六日在總統航空政策局中警吿稱，蘇聯正準備與美國「以全力周旋到底」，要求政府補助民間航空，作爲軍力之後備資源。</p>
<h3>日本民主黨決定開除幣原派黨籍</h3>
<p>「中央社東京廿六日電」日本民主黨已將前首相幣原喜重郞及其他民主黨黨員二十三人開除黨籍，因彼等不服從黨方之決定，而於昨夜投票反對煤礦國營法案。民主黨此次所頒發之開除黨籍令，咸被認爲一項極端劇烈行動，蓋此舉已使民主黨在議會中降爲名列第三之政黨。</p>
<p>「新亞社東京廿七日電」日衆院經煤礦案一度激烈鬥爭後，各黨派勢力均有變化。據最近之統計爲社會黨一四〇席，民主黨一二六席，自由黨一二〇席，國協黨三〇席；倘以煤礦案投票時之情形，民主黨幣原派廿四人脫離民主黨而參加自由黨，則自由黨將可能成爲國會第一黨。但迄今爲止，幣原等尙無跳黨之表示。</p>

<h3>請提高特遇未遂引水員中止服務</h3>
<p>「本報訊」江海關管轄之上海區引水事宜，（包括上海至外銅沙間領港）引水員計外籍二十人，國籍兩人，共計二十二人，引水費向以美金計算。自政府規定匯率後，常照中央銀行掛牌結算，惟與黑市相差甚鉅，引水員一再要求，曾於本月一日起，海關規定引水費外，增加百分之四十附加費，近因外匯一再提高，物價價上漲不已，引水員生活又受打擊，乃向江海關上海區引水辦事處交涉，要求提高待遇。江海關巡工司認爲本月一日己附加百分之四十，至今未滿一月，再度要求調整，殊欠合理，致爲全體引水員不滿，突於昨日上午十時起停止服務。海關巡工司旋即與航政局商討，對上海區引水問題，在未解決前，由航政局設法維持。據江海關上海區引水辦事處楊　麟吿記者稱：對於此事並不嚴重，現正商議中，日內即可究滿解決。</p>

<p>張春帆由法警押到時，塞滿地院之旁聽七百餘人，聞訊騷動，爭欲一觀，經法警將張覊押小囚室中，二時未到，第八法庭即因人滿，將大門加鎖，二時正，梅爾和推車偕檢察官陳壽陶，書記官馮見仁升座提審。張身着灰綫呢長袍，足登直貢呢鞋，首由檢察官陳述起訴要旨，略謂張明知筱有自殺之危險，不加防七，涉有敎唆自殺罪嫌。</p>
<h3>筱仱年方十八來滬首次登台</h3>
<p>隨即訊張，供稱：四十一歲，嵊縣人，筱丹桂係在十年前嵊縣鄉下買戲班時買來，時筱年方十八。來滬後首次組班登台係恩派亞大戲院。廿二歲與我發生關係，至　四歲始秘密同居於浙東大戲院對面。次年筱即入國際大戲院演出新式越劇，去年方自設國泰戲院經常主演。問：你怎樣曉得十月七日筱與冷同去看戲？答：「七號夜裏，筱十一點鐘才回家，我問她從那裏來，她說同兪家姆媽看影戲去的，我以兪家姆媽那晚在國泰看戲，我曾遇見談過話，怎麼會在看電影，就追究她倒底往那裏去過，她又說是和五金小開同去的，看完吃夜飯，所以遲了」，問以前有此種舉動否，答沒有，袛不過常有許多越劇迷寫信給她：間冷山後來導過何戲？內容如何？答導過「怒火之花」，內容是講一個姨太太被人引誘，結果自殺的事，問是否與本案情形相仿，張低首不答。問後來怎知她與冷山同去看電影，答「後來我用好話勸她，她才承認是同冷山去看電影，並說以前也同去看過幾次，我說看戲沒有關係，你們借劉瓊的信箱通信則不大好，到了八日，我才約吳傑同去呌冷山來對質。</p>

<p>小插曲</p>
<h3>破門而入率先一人藍禁三時</h3>
<p>「本報訊」昨審張春帆時，旁聽人達七百餘，法院廣塲爲之塞滿，第八法庭祗能容一百人，不得其門而入者在門外大鬧，法官乃宣佈暫時退庭，羣衆不守秩序，破門而入，爲首一人即遭逮捕，送入小囚室，監禁三小時，於張案審畢後臨時審訊，此人堅不肯吐其姓名，經訓責後飭回，可謂小插曲之一。</p>
<h3>庭門啟處人入潮涌</h3>
<p>供述至此已歷一刻鐘，門外人聲鼎沸，撃門如雷，致審訊無法繼續，宣吿暫時退庭，後將庭門開啓，門外羣衆一擁而入，勢若潮湧。梅推事當請示査院長是否須改期續審，經査院長指示稍綏，待羣衆部份散去後續審，候至四時一刻，旁聽者散去大半，僅餘一二百餘人，經加派法警十餘人後重復開庭，續訊張春帆。問：後來呌冷山對質，是何目的？答；怕冷山在外面造謠中傷，才約吳深，劉濤同找他來解釋。問：筱平日怎樣與冷聯絡。答：用電話，同時借劉瓊信箱通信，有過七八封。</p>
<p>哭做一團哄堂大小問：你見到冷山后，爲對他說「　丹桂自殺了」是何意思。答：沒有，我說一你別開口，我女人都講給我聽過了，你老老實實說吧」。冷才承認與筱到金門看電影，後來到兆豐公園遊玩。最後　冷山發舊，冷山照辦後就走了，這時我大哭，筱丹桂也哭，吳深。劉濤也哭，大家哭做一團（哄堂大笑）。十三日下午我還在跟朋友談笑，豈知她就自殺了。問：筏平日善演悲劇抑喜劇，答：善演喜劇，悲劇演得不好。問：你知筱自殺原因安在，答：我想是有人拿話刺激她的緣故。</p>
<p>打我一記耳光叫我說出實情訊至此，傅訊冷山，冷着灰四裝，灰山衣，與其灰色之臉。極相調和。證稱：「　歲，蘇州人，現在上海實驗電影工塲任演員，進國泰後導演第一劇爲「此恨綿綿」。問：與筱怎會熟識？答：起初大家都是平常朋友，後來因有好幾位演員很有向上心，願意跟我硏究　術，筱丹桂也是其中之一。問：九月底如何與筱聯絡？答：九月底我由蘇州回滬，筱打電話給我，約我談談，我說近日沒空，過幾天好了，到十月七日，約定到大華看「芙蓉春色」沒成，因天氣熱，沒地方去，就到兆豐公園散散心。十月八日張春帆忽到我家來找我說有事商談，上車後他說「筱丹桂自殺了」，我奇怪得很，追問他。劉濤說「到家再說吧」，到張家後，見筱睡在床上，沒有表情，張就說「你們昨天在那裏開房間？「我說「你用全套套我吧，先說彼自殺，現怎麼又說我與她開房間？」他大怒，打我一記耳光，呌我向吳深述說實情，說過後筱也說「我若不淸白，我自殺好了」。</p>
<p>你平凡我不平凡</p>
<p>張說：「你死了我才相信」，筱哭了，大家相勸。由我起誓聲明沒做過什麼不淸白事才了，但張氣還不平，說「沒這麽便當，我要你的八字（指要我性命），我臨走說「以後我永不跟筱丹桂來往好了」。次日我即回蘇。繼傳劉濤，證稱十月八日上午十時，天正下雨，張來找我，謂筱與冷山有『攪七　三』事，約我及吳深同去找冷山，找到後到張家，冷山說「看看電影也是很平凡的事」，張說「你平凡，我不平凡」，撩起手掌望打冷山，碰到他頭髮，後由冷山道歉發　後了事。九日十日十一日，我均去渦張家，到十三日晚才知筱自殺了。末由沈益濤，魏美雲，陳德來，周寳奎，勞振南，周明達，葉志成，陳達卿，富春林等證述之過後，庭諭本案改期續訊。至筱妹錢瓊韻及吳深二人，均因故未到庭作證，退庭前張之律師要求交保不准，張春帆仍還押。</p>

<h3>南庫頁島百餘歸僑抵滬後食宿成問題　橋務機關苦無經費。市長允供一周給養</h3>
<p>「本報訊」蘇輪「戈果里」號昨天經南庫頁島上帶來了一百六十一個男女老幼僑胞，其中約七十個是婦女和孩子中。而婦女中除了六個是中國女子外，其他都是僑胞的日本老婆。僑胞們並不承認他們中間有日本人，原來她們早已入了中國籍了。老山東帶着口本口音說：「不願做巾國人，不願到巾國來的老婆，我們都不要她們了。這些都是一直跟中國人的。「除了山東老鄉外，都是浙江，福建去的僑胞。他們從前多數很窮苦，單身流亡到國外，有的賣布，有的做工，有的種田，有的開飯館子.慢慢地，他們有了些積蓄，就在當地成家。最老的，住在那邊已有三十多年，最少也有十幾年。這數十年來，一直是在日本人統治下過日子的。不過據說日本人對他們還不錯，給他們自由做買賣，不太麻煩他們，祗是不准他們回國。尤其是有了老婆孩十的絕對不准離開。</p>
<p>當三年前「老毛子」（他們對俄國人的稱呼稱來後，悄形就不同了。他們把僑胞們歷年辛苦積蓄下來的錢財。傢具。牛羊，挑好的多的都拿走了，還鞭打他們。然而和日本人比起來，中國人還是僥倖的，因爲「毛子」軍人至少還不殺他們，他們說「中國和蘇聯是友邦」。</p>
<p>「毛子」要僑胞替他們做工，祇給他們十五個慮布一天，吃住都是須自理，或給他們六十個盧布一月，給他們二片黑麵包一天，而米却要買一百五十慮布一升。總之，他們是吃不飽的，一個月的工錢祗够吃十天。女人們也都做工，她們給「毛子」看狐狸，狐狸反就是用來做女人大衣領子的。一位福建老頭兒說，「孩子們在十五歲以上都得做工，十五歲以下在家做家務事」。僑胞該子以前在南庫頁島進日本學校，現在「毛子」不辦學校，孩子們都不念書。</p>
<p>交涉三年方出虎口</p>
<p>僑胞們在那邊也沒有什麼正式的組織，不過以前往日本人管轄時代，有個　太中華商會，曾長名慮昌邦。另一個名王定仙的，他在那邊幹監井生意，莫是領袖，全體僑胞們每年有三次聚在一起吃酒作樂。這次他們兩人都是歸國團的代表，帶領其他僑胞返國。說起回國，這在他們實在是一件奮鬥史。多少年來，他們要回到中國來，可是在强暴的統治者掌下，他們總是失敗。這次能逃出虎口，是由於中國領事與蘇聯常局交涉三年之久，才達到目的，總算除了還有四五個人外，全部都回來了。可是在北庫頁島還有三百多個僑胞痛苦地活着，他們將不知何年何月才能回到的懐抱！</p>
<p>問起他們叵來後作什麽呢？他們的回答多半是個微笑，或是「以後再看吧！」他們也許還滿懐着希望吧。而事實上呢，他們還未知道自己是一個沒有人救濟的流浪者呢——這件事原是由蘇聯方面通知外交部由外交部轉駐滬辦事處辦理，但駐滬辦事處根本沒有錢，僑務委員會上海僑務處也無經費，行總的救濟事宜也早已結束。結果由僑務處代表向市長請求，幸由市長答應供給一個星期的給養，可是以後呢，至少現在尙無辦法。不但以後沒有辦法，連昨天的住處也沒有，「舉目無親身無分文戈果里」停在浦江中心，這批人經船上上岸，脚夫搬行李估計要六百萬左右，誰出這筆錢？「戈果里」船公司代理人不肯出。這一百多可憐的難民雖在船上已度過了七天，昨晚還是祗能再在船上吹一夜海風。而今天若再沒有去處，他們只能露宿街頭了。因爲「戈果里」明天要駛返海參威，俄國人要把船先行消毒。而他們這次來的，除了一點破衣服舖蓋外，分文都沒有。在他們返國前，俄國人是不准他們帶錢出口的，他們僅餘的一些錢都交給中國領事館，將來再由中國政府與蘇方接洽後交還給他們。僑務處的負責人昨天去調查有沒有華僑在國內有親戚朋友可以立即遣送的，然而一個也沒有。有一位老太太，她是唯一去接客人的，但結果這批人中卻沒有一個是建的親戚。她們離家數十年，久無音訊，早不知往那裏去找親戚朋友。船上還有一個女人患着腦膜炎。幸經外部駐滬辦事處聞松齡和僑務處鄭魯意等，設法把她先帶上岸來送入了時疫醫院。其他一百六十個人今天的吃住，明天的，或者以後的，到昨天下午爲止，全無辦法。　得靠這幾位的熱誠，連夜去奔走設法。</p>

<h3>香港「渣滓」　政客顯壺充醫師　責淫婦與良家女等量齊觀</h3>
<p>「本報香港廿日航訊」民盟在國內宣佈解散後，其在本港的「民盟南總——却加倍活躍起來。民盟南總負責人彭澤民，在香港僻靜的卑路乍街一角小樓上，掛起一個「國醫彭澤民」的招牌，縣　問世。他今年七十一歲，顯見他已經乘乘老矣，民盟南總的所在地，實際是九龍靑山。他們在那裏的一間大別　裏，（屬蔡廷錯的產業）多了一個「達德學院」，加緊培植新的幹部，院長是陳其瑗。主特者有鄧初民，千家駒，陳世生，黃藥眠等。</p>
<p>蔡廷錯產業利用</p>
<p>陳與彭兩人，在國共分家前，都是國民黨第二屆執行委員會的執委，但在本港棲遲的反對派人物中，却以李濟深和蔡廷鍇等人最受注意。李蔡兩人現仍在港，李氏日前接見港中某報，（按即工商晚報）記者大談中國近代史事，說到他目前在港的生活，祇靠他在南京的一幢房子月租八千萬元來維持，他頗有意到美國去，聽說他請領的一百萬元美金外匯，還未獲常局所批准。他有一個兒子和一個女兒在美國。他住香港富人住宅區的羅便臣道，房子是他自置的，相當宏敞。蔡廷　在（香港置下的產業很多，在反對派人物中，堪稱「首屈一指」。</p>
<p>考捐欵坐着享受</p>
<p>跑馬地山村道，羅便臣道，鳳輝台，摩理臣山道，九龍塘，都有蔡的房子，聽說共有五十多座新式大洋房，他到了現在還吃着事着一二八淞滬抗戰的民衆捐款，據說他每天很忙，他和李濟深，何香凝，陳樹　（陳維周之子，陳濟棠的姪）等人組有一個「民主促進會」。不論民盟南總也好，「民立促進會」也好，他們在港的「機關報」，就是天天高呼反政府的華商報。</p>
<p>嚇壞了護士小姐</p>
<p>還有一件饒有趣味的事情，是香港　察拿良家婦女當作「阻街女郞」拘捕，這事件已哄動了整個小島。十六日晚上八時三刻左右，有三個小姐從香港上層人物薈萃的香港大酒店茶廳跑出來，給一個警察攔住，硬指她們是阻街女郞，要押回警局去。其實，她們都是護士小姐，雖說明各自身份，警察也不諒解，也不准她們「通電話覓人保證」，後得旁人代爲電吿她們服務醫務所襄的醫生，由醫生駕車親送她們前往警局，才算存案釋出。這個事件發生後，港地工商晚報說：「阻街女郞現已成爲香港一特有名辭，香港警察藉着這個特殊名辭，而可以隨街拘捕婦女……這我們實詔爲香港警察有遠背英憲「保護人體自由權利」之嫌了！才新生晚報主張嚴懲那個造成「極端嚴重問題」的那個警察。英文南華早報認爲「阻街“loitering”辭。頗難有適當的範圍，也勸告警察等重人權。以後如要拘捕「阻街女郞」，也要經過「充分的警吿一後才好下手。</p>
<p>不幸者放棄控訴</p>
<p>那三位不幸者，一名譚薇，一名害實運，一名岑瑞淸，事後給港澳婦運會寫了一封信，有謂「此種濫捕良家婦女，不惟使全港女同胞時蒙不名譽之玷，於行動上更人人自危，使全港婦女界如籠罩一種恐怖空氣」，但她們最後表示，不願擴大那事件，已決定不向警察方面起訴。但中西婦女界方面則上書港督，要求主持正義，幷希望今後不要再有同樣事件發生。</p>
<p>莫須有阻街之罪</p>
<p>按此案（三個護士小姐被拘案）之前，過去也有一個晚上，發生過同樣事件：兩位太太，一名曾希運，（她的丈夫曾任香港副警司的　譯），一名莫英，（她的丈夫是一個洋紙商人），也給警察以莫須有的「阻街」之罪拘捕，莫英還在警署挨了一個初冬的寒夜，此種事實，可見香港警察因太過興奮從公，對市民身體自由一層，似乎還見尊重了！記者過去已報道了港府百年來首次的把兩名「阻街女郞」遞解出境的消息，所謂「阻律女郞」即流動街頭的賣淫女人，港府以如許嚴厲的手段對付賣淫女子，是否有當，姑且不論，但對有夫之婦戰有正當職業的小姐，袛要晚上出外，警察便不分皂白，而把他們拘捕，與責淫女人同等論罪，豈不是「駭人聽聞」？誰無妻女，無怪港僑紛紛議論，而哄動全城了。（本報特約記者子健）</p>

<h3>香蕉·柑橘　在海運下掙扎</h3>
<p>「本報台北廿五日航訊」台省香蕉與柑桔　量，過去在農產物中佔第三位，外銷最多時，有香蕉三，五〇八，四六四籠，柑桔二九八，〇〇〇箱，如果折合現價，香蕉就有合幣七十億元，柑桔約合幣十二億元。</p>
<p>以前運銷日本的數量佔總量的八成半，國內的大連，天津，靑島，上海，福州等地，合起來僅佔一成半。目下台北，新竹，台中三地，柑桔產量已與光復前相差無幾。高雄，合中兩處的香蕉增產，不久也可以達到往年生產的最高數字。可是銷路呢？日本已經不算在內，百分之百可以運到國內，但受了海運限制，使本省香蕉和柑桔遭受到窒息的命運。</p>
<p>往日基隆日本橫濱，香蕉每籠運費一元三角，到門司九角，到上海七角八分，以當時香蕉每籠價格十一元至十四元五角來計算，運費只佔賣價的百分之十乃至十五。現在則由基隆到上海，一籠香蕉需運費一千一百元，佔賣價五成强，到天津要三千元，佔到賣價的十五成。推銷靑果到外埠應得的利潤，全都落在運費上了。</p>
<p>本省靑果業者，多在呼籲：减低海運運費，改善運輸技術，希望重視這些特產如同米，小麥，麵粉一樣，因爲它確是本省產業爭取出口的一支生力軍。</p>

<p>又云：水獺屬獸類之一種，畫伏山中，夜出食魚，本　多山，河水淸淺，頗爲水獺生活之良所，平原無山之水邊，甚少獺至。捕獺者貴得其皮，年爲京杭皮客重金搜去，沽値嘗十百倍於其他獸皮，尤其白獺，更爲無價之寳。（特約記者兪寧頗）</p>

<h3>鎭江桃案　田姑娘　懸樑　尋死路</h3>
<p>本報鎭江廿六日訊」廿五日下午，省警局二分局又發生一件類似是桃色懸樑自縊案，緣有江都女子田姑娘，（廿六歲，住剪子巷一三三號），在三年前避亂來鎭江，住姨姐夫黃繼良家裏，（即剪子巷一三三號（據她說：今年三月間與黃繼良發生關係，他要我做小老婆，我也答應了，</p>
<p>在今年八月裏，小產後一直到晨近，黃繼良就不理她，姨姐還要趕我回家，我氣憤不過，今天下午在房裏上吊，鄰居爬院牆到我房裏，割斷了繩子把我救下來，現在我祗要有衣穿，有飯吃，別的無所謂。又據黃繼良供：本地人四十一歲，開小雜貨店，田姑娘是我妻子的姨妹，到我家已經三四年，我當她親戚看待，衣食由我完全担負，她有點神經病，硬說我與他有關，她在家上吊，我完全不曉得。朱局員訊問後，認爲本案大致已明，暫留分局，俟調査實淸後，轉送總局發落。</p>
<h3>台省農林處　計劃經濟造林</h3>
<p>「本報台北廿三日航訊」台灣因爲有三千公尺以上的高山，擁有雄厚的百分之三十的森林資源，過去日人積極實施建設，需材孔殷，每年尙須進口一百數十萬石，後來開放闊葉樹林，增產五十萬石，但仍須入超百萬石，至戰爭末期供應軍需，每年砍伐達二百萬右，面積約二萬公頃，造材則不能　及，到現在年伐一萬一千公頃以上，較造林面積增二</p>
<p>森林的濫砍濫伐，使人們痛感到五年十年以後，本省百分之七十以上的山林，會成爲荒山，而更直接使農田蒙受損害。最近，東部羅東因爲接連下了二十天雨，水源暴漲，以坡度在401法從速宣洩，於是潰堤淹水，廬舍爲墟，說者謂這是由於濫伐森林的結果，其實河床的提高和淤塞，也是主因。</p>
<p>省農林處長徐慶鐘計劃以用材木，樟樹林，薪炭林，及熱帶特用樹種爲主眼，編造一大經濟造林案，在五年之內將十二萬三千餘公頃的山地從事造林，需要苗木四千六百萬株。他說目前造林不但是財政，技術問題，而且是思想問題，現正擬具以全省三百戈，盜伐，二面從事獎勵。</p>
<p>水利局　　錫綬認爲合灣正因先天條件不够，才有人工的水電機農田灌溉工程。就堤防而論，全省有四十七萬公尺，有四萬公尺亟待修理，去年公共工程局修了一萬七千公尺，六月間竟被冲毀了一萬九千公尺，本年要求修理二萬公尺，因爲省車沒錢，袛能修八千公尺，假使不能逐年整理，賴以種植的九百萬畝田的命遝就很悲觀。</p>
<p>台灣的林木，提防，河川，　溉，在　業的發展上，息息相關。翁文關於視察台灣後對記者說，亂砍了森林用作木炭，改權香蕉園，實是可怕的現象，這森林資源確需要我們的珍貴和保養。</p>

<h3>平匯會負責人表示　黑市匯率已失常態　新定匯價對出口商頗有利益</h3>
<p>「本報訊」外匯平衡基金委會某負責人昨語記者：最近匯率調整後，出口結匯情形相當良好·一般出口商，咸認該會目前所定之匯率市價，實屬切合實際。對出口商之成本，已能顧到。至黑市匯率，業已失去常態，早已不足爲憑·如以我國與各國貨幣之內在購買力相衡量，即知目前平衡委會所定匯率之合理性云·</p>
<p>「又訊」連日盛傳政府將改變外匯政策及撤銷外匯平衛基金委員會，記者昨特往動該會主委陳光甫與沈熙瑞而氏，承吿稱：政府並未考慮及此，一切皆屬謠傳。對於黑市外匯之波動，陳氏表示「不足爲憑」，因外匯市價與黑市無多關連。幷據沈氏謂：最近一次市價調整後，出口商又得益不少，一般出口貨皆能出口，而僑匯數量亦已增加。但渠等對有人主張外匯市價提高至超過黑市以打聲黑市之方法，不表同意·認爲此法責與黑市競賽云。</p>
<h3>謀抑平紗布漲風　紡調決配棉紡紗　國行允撥無證外棉三萬包</h3>
<p>「本報訊」紡調會息：日來紗價激漲，主要原因，係由於原棉價格高漲，成本增加所致。該會頃爲抑制花紗布市價計，已得國行張總栽允准，撥出無許可證外棉三萬包，交由紡調會分配各紗廠代紡棉紗，俾各廠不致在市塲爭購棉花，抬高棉價，問接收抑平紗布市價之效。凡過去向該會承辦代紡，著有信用，且存棉確屬缺乏之紗廠，均可向該會申請配棉。至於分配辦法，尙在硏討中。</p>
<p>紗價提升</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，賡續飛揚，天津及粵漢各帮採辦仍暢，業外拉提亦勁，行情一味喊漲，漫無止境，新高價層見疊出，迨將收市，因業外物資回疲，人心轉平，逢高了吐甚多，市氣微見回挫。但結果四十二支籃鳳細紗，比上日仍續漲一百八十萬元，爲五千三百八十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗價，亦步昂自二三十萬至一百四五十萬元不一。</p>

<p>華股昨以國外刺激，有進無退，初低繼高。但大量獲利者在塲外傾售，過程未免由燦爛而漸歸平淡振作。臨收以四二六元及四四〇元結束。結果較晨收即交股計國貨漲停，閘北漲半成，永紗信和華新美亞新光景福勤興中法新華火柴華豐中絲統益均吿微降，內衣景綸中興均平，餘略見升。遞交股計勤興尙平，餘均微跌。塲外各老股計大生獨漲一成，文化公用及銀行股再好半成。</p>
<p>套利穩定</p>

<h3>「醫事糾紛」之過去與現在　節錄作者在醫師公會席上演詞</h3>
<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>主席各位長官各位來賓各位前輩</p>
<p>在過去一年當中，醫事糾紛案件之多，打破空前未有的紀錄，自一月一日到今天（十一月十六日）短短的不到一年的時間裏，在浙江和京滬一省兩市當中，發生了三十件以上醫事訟案；其他經調解而未興訟公庭的當數倍於此；僅僅的十一月上旬，（一日到十二日）在上海一市，正式興訟的醫事糾紛，已有三件，平均每四天一件，瞿姜兩正副總幹事與爵業服務本會，在這短短的十二天當中，僅僅爲此事奔走而浪費的時間，每人當在十數小時以上，長此以往非惟本會幹事疲於奔命，而各位會員在此風聲鶴唳之中，日興草木皆兵之感，此風不息，非惟手術與難產無人敢做，即重要注射，亦感難於下手；直接固影響會員業務之發展，間接將危及病者之生命，社會之安寗，十百年後更將使有志習醫之靑年裹足不前而使整個的民族健康，每况愈下，爵榮有鑒於此，實有不敢不言，與不忍不言者；茲將個人最近兩月來奔走京杭，搜集之糾紛材料，作一簡明之分析與統計於後；俾司法當局與社會人士洞悉糾紛之起源，知所判判判斷，而本會會員亦可了解本身之弱點，有所警惕，最後幷附醫事糾紛之消彌方案，供大會討論；爵榮才疏識淺，人微言輕，尙希各前輩對此切身問題，不吝指敎！</p>
<p>案件之分析與統計：</p>
<p>（一）科別分類：</p>
<p>因內科或注射而發生糾紛者十四例　佔百分之四十七</p>
<p>因手術或麻醉而發生糾紛者九例　佔百分之一二十</p>
<p>因難產而發生糾紛者五例佔百分之十六·四</p>
<p>因電療而發生糾紛者一例佔百分之三·三</p>
<p>因喉科而發生糾紛者一例佔百分之三·三</p>
<p>（二）死渚年齡分類：成年男子十五人佔百分五十成年女子九人佔百分三十未成人兒童六人佔百分二十</p>
<p>（三）家庭狀况分類富有佔百分之五中上佔百分之十中等佔百分之廿五淸苦佔百分之六十</p>
<p>（四）家屬職業分類材料搜集困難，暫不公佈！</p>
<p>（五）案情發展分類</p>
<p>不起訴處分者十九件佔百分之六十二·八</p>
<p>起訴而宣判無罪者六件佔百分之二十·二</p>
<p>初審判罪而上訴覆判無罪者一件佔百分之三·四</p>
<p>初審判罪正在上訴中者一件佔百分之三·二</p>
<p>在審理中結果米知者三件佔百分之十·二</p>
<p>（六）起訴理由分類過失殺人致死八件毀壊屍體一件延遲診治致人於死一件助手過失殺人一件</p>
<p>糾紛發生原因之探討A·屬於病家方面的：</p>
<p>一，病人家屬之感情作用</p>
<p>二，社會經濟崩潰之自然趨勢</p>
<p>三，少數醫院醫師與外界不艮印像所發生之後果</p>
<p>B·屬於醫師本人方面的</p>
<p>一，醫師之不諳國情（如向屍屬請求解剖屍體致起糾紛例（</p>
<p>二，醫師之不諳法律常識（以爲病人或家屬已簽志願書，醫者無責例）</p>
<p>三，事件前對病家能度之不够和善</p>
<p>四，不了解病家心理，（病人死後，對其家屬應具極大之同情）</p>
<p>五，極少數同道收費太昂，且必須預付，致與病家以乘人於危之不良印象</p>
<p>C·屬於第三者方面的</p>
<p>一，醫院種種手續之麻煩，</p>
<p>二，少數事務人員之態度欠佳，</p>
<p>三，入院前或手術前預付費用之過份認眞</p>
<p>四，同道或類似同道之惡意挑撥，</p>
<p>五，病人親友鄰居舍中好事份子之慫恿，</p>
<p>現在法律及新聞界對醫事糾紛之處理情形：</p>
<p>一·檢察官與推事之自由採證制度對法醫意見可不完全採納，除法醫外，法院亦無延聘其他專家爲「鑑定人」之規定。</p>
<p>二·簽定手術志願書因民法第二二二條之規定，對危險性病症，除輕微過失外，重大過失，不生免除責任之效力，故病人或家屬之簽字同意僅能爲手術上危險性之承諾。</p>
<p>三·新聞記者因同情屍屬之不幸遭遇，時有刋登「庸醫殺人」等不利醫界之文字致引起一般人士對醫界之不良印象一且此種人士自身遭遇類似之不幸事件時，以前例可援遂致毫不猶豫，與醫界對簿公庭。</p>
<p>醫事糾紛可能引起之後果</p>
<p>（一）因隨時有負刑事責任之可能，醫者或將發展至「見危而不敢救」（祗求進得衙門，不求進得廟門）例如本可注射針劑者，將改用內服劑，或施行手術，尙有一綫之希望者，外科醫師爲避免責任或聽其發展而不敢動手！</p>
<p>（二）因隨時有被宣吿破產之虞，（例如民事賠償七千五百萬元之判例）稍有身價之醫家或將放棄醫業，從政從商，先天不足之醫師人數，勢將更减。</p>
<p>（三）靑年學子自小學而中學，由預科而專門，念載寒窗，焚膏繼晷，未獲醫師資格前因體格，因智力，因經濟，而中途淘汰者，十之六七！幸而獲醫師學位，待遇旣極輕微，（戰前駐院醫師月薪百元，生活頗可優裕，現在月入僅數十萬元，溫飽堪處！）生活又殊枯燥（日夜工作，整天與愁苦之病人相處）！加以責任之重，雖終日戰戰兢兢，臨淵履薄，而莫須有之罪名仍可因病家之誤解而隨時加諸其身，庸醫殺人之消息一經刋登，數十年之信譽努力，盡付東流，雖他日宣判無罪，而已身敗口裂，難挽狂瀾！如此境况，醫者之子，必不　醫，而其實他非醫者之子弟，又焉有多費數載光陰，近億費用，選習醫科而自投羅網，最高當局中國之命運中所載五年造就醫師十萬人之計劃，必因此而蒙受最大打擊，民族健康，前途，與諸建國大計，焉能不因此而受重大之影響！此作者之不忍為社人士吿者也。</p>
<p>英美法蘇的醫事糾紛：</p>
<p>作者對法律雖喜硏究，但僅略識之無，此節有關各國法律，寫本節前曾向震旦大學法學院彭院長請益三小時，並曾拜訪推檢法醫及法律專家多位，故此節所寫，係綜合各專家指示，如有未盡是處，仍希各專家斧正；並於此向彭院長及諸專家致謝！</p>
<p>（一）英國採專家陪審制度：英國甚少醫事糾紛，如不幸發生，大致由法院就當地各醫學院及醫學會聘請專家參加陪審，判決時由各專家投票表決有罪無罪，再由法官宣判。</p>
<p>（二）美國之意外保險制度時有所聞，但起訴部份大多要求一民事賠償」；甚少控吿醫師刑數均向保險公司保有「業務意外」險。（辦法亦如汽車之意外險）不幸糾紛發生保險公司負責代理訴訟及賠償！</p>
<p>（三）法蘇之專家鑑定制度：大致各地法院遇有醫事糾紛時承審推檢，均就當地專家中指聘一人或數人爲「鑑定人」以審査醫師之有無過失，其鑑定之結果，能左右法官之判決，鑑定人並應於鑑定前具結，具結文內應記載「必爲公正誠實之鑑定」等語，以示公正！</p>
<p>如何消彌糾紛於永久？</p>
<p>（甲）希望各個會員做到的</p>

<p>（乙）希望本曾做到的：</p>
<p>（一）對會員宣傳醫德，對社曾介紹本曾會員服務社會之眞象（本會全體會員每年爲社會免費診治之人數相當鉅大，因向無綜合統計，致外界不明眞象）</p>
<p>（二）舉辦法律講座灌輸會員法律常識。</p>

<p>（二）希望法律界同人對醫界同情，遇有當事人無理取鬧時，加以勸導！</p>

<p>（丁）希望於立法司法行政當局者：</p>
<p>（一）希望敎育部對全國醫學敎育預算數字提高，對各醫學院各醫，藥，產，護等專門學校，設備應多加改良，師資宜多加培植，欲求最高富局醫事人員五年計劃之實現，尤應於內地多多開設醫校，求醫師質量之同時改進，傳早日實現「公醫制度」。</p>
<p>（二）希望於衛生部者</p>
<p>A·保陣人民生命，對醫師部證之發給，特別愼重；但一經發給，則應對醫師業務相當保障，對醫師執照之吊銷應相當愼重。</p>
<p>B·對一部份甄審勉强及格或在及格分數下不遠之醫務人員應重加短期訓練，並分發各公醫，院，實習當時日，俟成績許可派入各急需醫師，而尙無醫師之地區，工作相當時期；然後給與執照，准其自由開業，以示兩全！</p>
<p>C·對公醫制度應逐年分區推進，俾貧苦產病，治療有所，而减輕社會對醫師之責難，（因醫師爲維持其自身及家庭生活，勢不能完全免費為病家服務）</p>
<p>D·對一部法令應加修改：「例一」助產士在未畢業前不得單獨接生，而敎部法令，則規定助產士在畢業前至少應有單獨接生若干次之經騐。方許畢業。</p>
<p>「例二」無醫師執照者，不得作靜脈注射，此意良佳，但各大醫院之駐院醫師多爲各醫學院之六年級生並無執照，不使注射，則永無學習機會，任其注射，則不幸而起糾紛，其敎授將代人受過故欲求醫學敎育健全，應謀兩全之策。</p>
<p>（三）希望於立法司法當局者：</p>
<p>一，中醫與新醫制度不同，方法各異，必欲繩之以同樣之醫師法，實屬欠當，致於醫師法，應如何修改，本會另有專門委員會在討論中容再爲文申論之·</p>
<p>二，醫事糾紛案件，最好能採用英國之「專家陪審制度」，至少亦應通令全國法院，事後遇有醫事糾紛，除絕到尊重法醫意見外，幷應効法法國延聘當地醫學院醫學會醫師公會等專家爲「鑑定人」案件之判決，應尊重鑑定人意見，（刑事訴訟法第一八九條聞已有「鑑定人制度」之規定。）</p>
<p>三，寃獄賠償制度：近年司法界本在推動之中，鑒於本會會員過去蒙受之損失，此種「冤獄賠償」或「誣吿反坐」制度，實應草日促其實現！</p>
<p>（四）希望於內政部或新聞局者：</p>
<p>爲保障本會人員權益，應請通令全國各地報紙刊物，在三審未判決前，愼勿刊登妨害醫師信譽之標題，如「庸醫殺人」等。</p>
<p>以上數點果能各方合作逐步實現，則醫事糾紛或可消彌於永久，願與本會諸公共同努力，以求實現，如蒙大會通過，願以本會名義，向全國醫師公會聯合會本屆大會提出建議，向各有關院部請願，衆志成城，有志竟成，願共勉之。</p>

<h3>「裙帶風」的盛世</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>漢朝在歷史上是稱　　盛世」的，而歷史上「裙帶風」最盛的時代，恐怕亦莫過於東漢的末葉了。雖然其始爲俑者爲遠在秦代昭王的母親宣太后，開了這個惡例；但到漢代則大大的被採用起來。其原因乃係母后要代替兒子皇帝專政，任用別人深怕對自己不利，於是便引用自己的父兄，委以重任，造成一個外戚執政的局面。</p>
<p>據史記云：「昭王立，年少，宣太后自知事，以同母弟魏冉爲將軍，任政，封穰侯」，固然是歷史上太后攝政的開端，同時也便是重用「裙帶」的開始。</p>
<p>到了漢朝，高祖駕崩，呂后臨朝，她乃極力培植「裙帶」的勢力，將呂家的子弟如呂召，呂產，呂祿，呂通等都封了王，打破她丈夫手創的「非劉而王者，天下共誅之」的限制。直到呂后痛歿以後，姓劉的纔又抬起頭來，由朱靈侯劉章與他的同宗絳侯勃等結成聯合陣綫，「捕諸呂男女，無少長，皆斬之。」始將呂氏的「裙帶」勢力一網打盡。</p>
<p>其後，由「裙帶」關係而覓取封侯的，仍是代不乏人。漢武帝時因相互爭寵，而結果鬧成你死我活的竇嬰和田蚣，固都屬「裙帶」中人。而同時代功名奕赫先後棘手可熱的衛靑，霍去病，李廣利，這三位大將軍，也都是由大舅子和阿甥的關係，得力於「裙帶」而發跡，以至飛黃騰達，直步靑雲的。霍去病的老弟大將軍光，奉武帝托孤之命，輔昭帝，引周公故事，做起實際上的假皇帝來。昭帝死了，迎立昌邑王賀，旋廢之；又迎立宣帝，並納其女入宮爲皇后，權勢更是了得！連宣帝也要懼他三分。如史謂：「帝初立，大將軍光驂乘，上嚴憚之，若有芒刺在背。」光死後，他的兒子們終於罹上了族誅的大禍。</p>
<p>至元帝，王皇后這一系的「裙帶」子弟，漸趨顯貴，以後歷成帝，哀帝兩朝，都成了姓王的世界。到了王莽，殺了平帝，就老實不客氣由攝皇帝進一步取而代之，使西漢一變而新莽。雖然那時間是很短暫的。</p>
<p>東漢時代，自孝章皇帝以後，母后臨朝，外戚用事，更成爲尋常的便事。若後漢書后妃紀上所載：「東京皇統累絕，權歸女主，外立者四帝（安質桓靈），臨朝者太后。莫不定策帷幕，委事父兄。貪孩童以久其政，抑明賢以專其威。」這眞到了一個「裙帶風」登峯造極的時代。也因此，釀成漢末的宦官之禍。結果也終於「陵夷大運，淪亡神室」，像靈思何太后引用了阿兄大將軍可進那固飯桶，欲誅宦官反被宦官誅了。召來董卓，却招致了一個羣雄割據，三國鼎立之局。觀此「裙帶風」的由來，可謂爲時已久；以觀今日比風之盛，又何足深怪嘞！</p>
<h3>喫飯問題</h3>
<p>— 蔣端生</p>
<p>際此米珠薪桂，厲行節約的當兒，入不敷出的薪水階級，樣樣都得盤算，衣可着敝裘，住可居擱樓，行可跑雙腿，連得「喫」也得節約，實在不得不如此耳。記得樸學大師胡樸安先生生前曾謂；「厲行節約，每餐只喫飯半盌，久久不覺苦矣！」眞有心人也。生在今世，翻翻古書，有關於喫飯事，隨錄於後，眞有令人嚮往，垂涎三尺之感；</p>
<p>「史記稱廉頗見趙使者，爲之一飽斗粟肉十斤，使者歸爲霄康將軍尙喜飯，誠哉其善飯也！」</p>
<p>「秦符堅時有夏默者，爲左鎭郞，護磨那者，爲右鎭郞，奄人申香堅，爲拂蓋郞。三人皆身長一丈八尺，並多力善射，每食，飯一石，肉三十斤。」較諸廉頗，已不啻臣朔之於侏儒矣。</p>
<p>「南燕王彎，濟南人也，身長九尺，腰帶十圍，貫田跨馬，不據鞍　，慕容德見而奇其魁偉，賜之以食，乃進一斛餘。德驚曰：「所瞰如此，非耕所能飽，且才貌不几，拜爲逢陵長。」　到官，政理修明，大收名譽，徵爲東萊太守。」使三人者而遇鶯，則又如小巫之見大巫矣。</p>
<p>「淸浙閩制府，孫公名爾準，字平叔，患水腫經年，以夢白先生薦，差官延夢廬往診，夢廬至，公疾已不可爲，診視畢，問頃日所食幾何，侍者從旁答曰：「此時胃氣大變，每日只可七八碗。」夢廬　聞訝然曰：「健飯若此，何云胃氣已變！」侍者曰：爺不知，較大人平日所餐，已不及十之三矣！」因言公未病時，常餐，需供豬蹄十個，他物稱是云。」</p>
<p>設若此輩誕於今世，必然大呼：「生不逢時」矣。</p>
<h3>三願</h3>
<p>— 劉榮</p>
<p>南唐宰相馮延已有樂府一章，名長命女云：</p>
<p>春日宴，綠酒一杯歌一遍，再拜陳三願：一願郞君千載，二願妾身長健，三願如梁上燕，歲歲長長相兌。</p>
<p>描寫淑女情懐，貞純不二，生生相祝，白首偕歸；歲歲年年，長相燕好，溫柔敎厚，辭釆豐容，置之古樂府中，可以無愧。</p>
<p>又古人詩云：「前日張家飲，昨日王家宴，今日過我廬，三日三會面，感此意　綿，與君發三願：一願世淸平，二願身長健，三願垂老時，數與君相見」。誦此，具見古人風義之窵，其敦厚深摯，爲不可及也。而所發三願，一願世淸平，在頻年戰亂，兵戈未已之今日，尤富現實感，可謂舉國上下一致之所靳求。二願身長健，固人人之所企祝。三願垂老時，數與君相見，於人心流漓，翻手作雲覆手兩之斯世，此種金石交契，垂老弗衰之友誼精神，尤値得則效發揮也。雖然，吾人之處現代，豈僅止乎以上三願而已哉！</p>
<h3>夜耗曲</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>椎剝啄；格鏗鏘。打碎杯盤咬破箱。帳頂縱充跑馬地，牀頭豈是鬥牛塲？吱吱啐啐還喊喊，屢駡這兒最苟　。辣醬缸中醬已霉；菜油壺內油亦竭。古恨今愁心若焚，米珠薪桂可憐人。夢迥聽爾談戀愛；害我中宵睡不成。應念勞人思婦疲，晝間工作十三時！漫搔玄鬢强開眼，徒拍床沿蹙損眉。於戲耗兮耗兮殘忍也！春夏秋冬夜轉夜；我家養不起貓兒，連宵任爾猖狂慣。爾見否不夜城中快樂窩，馬將叉罷笑呼呼。財通南北經營好，吃些東西不在乎！爾見否豪商囤積千鍾粟，老婆兒女顏如玉，鈔票堆山用不完，臨街高築黃金屋。節約聲中枕褲眠，生涯益發不如前。束修微薄難糊口，剪件衣裳百萬圓！</p>
<p>附註：夜耗迺老鼠別名。椎剝啄，鼠　物聲。格鏘鏗，物相擊傾倒聲。茍　，派頭不大之謂。枕褲眠，怕鼠咬壊，得不不爾。</p>
<h3>冬賑片言</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>初冬之夜，涼意颼颼，燈下讃西青散記，至所記丹陽老人一節，仁言靄如，廢書三嘆！如云：「每雨雪則扶杖歷野廟，問丐者疾苦，爲粥以賑之。所居必整廢拓隘，儲粟繕器具，時脫然讓人，空手徑去。謂人曰：有衣餘笥，忍人之寒；有米餘國，忍人之餒，，非乾父坤母生我之意，奈何同胞猶隔膜哉」！</p>
<p>當此滬上災民鑒集，冬令救濟亟待展開之時，施衣施粥，以及庇寒所之廣事設置，爲目前急不可緩之措施，據報載經費除公家指撥的一部份外，與實際所需數字相差甚遠，亟有待於慈善團體與仁人君子之踴躍輸將。海上爲全國經濟中心，雖頻年戰亂，通貨膨脹，工商業並不景氣；然而有衣餘笥，有米餘囷的仍不在少，倘能稍抑過分的享受，略節麋費，一味丹陽老人之言，多發點同情惻隱之心，多爲整個國家社會的安定與人道着想，當不吝於解囊的罷！</p>
<h3>西風</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>—負曝閒談之一—</p>
<p>西風又到人間！</p>
<p>一年四季，論風，自然以西風最爲討厭了！西風刻劃出貧富的苦樂，富者皮袍羢衫，貧者短褐不完，「勢利西風混沌夏，」荷花大少說盡了痛語。</p>
<p>但風是自然的產物，科學雖然進步要滅除風，還無辦法；強暴的秦始皇渡江至湘水祠，逢士風幾不能渡，上問博士湘君何神？博士對日，堯女舜妻葬此，始皇大怒，命刑徒三千人，皆伐湘山樹，砍樹做恨風發洩的勾當·豈不滑稽！</p>
<p>東坡志林載：「貴公子雪中飲醉，臨檻向風日：爽哉！左右聞之，有泣下者；公子驚問其故？始曰：吾父昔日以爽亡！這偵是苦樂絕大的矛盾，貴公子醉後臨檻，自然狐裘被體，吹陣西風，爽爽腦筋，難怪要說爽哉爽哉中，但左右之父，却是因爽致死，上海大菜館中的主顧酒醉飯飽後，立在窗前喊爽哉爽哉的恐怕甚多！不曉得街頭窮人在爽字聲中已死去不少了。</p>
<p>楚襄王登台，有風颯然而至，王曰：快哉此風，寡人與庶人共之耶？宋玉對日：此獨大王之雄風耳，庶人安得共之！獵獵西風中，願今日的貴公子輩喊過爽哉爽哉後，不要忘記爽死的人。</p>
<h3>法治和體制</h3>
<p>— 朱方</p>
<p>記得從前有位外國敎授他說：「法治和禮治，眞似吃菜一樣，法治好像吃西菜，每人一客，不得爭搶，多吃少吃，全在一個範圍內，超出範圍以外的，就是「錯」！而禮治則似吃中菜，如果大家客氣，則特別的好，碗中之菜，動都不動，到吃畢，還是很多，但是一個不對，那便你搶我議，吃得碗底向天不算，弄得不好，還要打一塲。」這眞是個妙喻。</p>
<p>總之，事情祗要好好地辦，沒有不行的。法治能「信賞必罪」，禮治能「明廉知恥」，它們的結果，都可以盜賊不興，路不拾遺，外戶不閉的。</p>
<h3>惜分飛</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>本報成都訊：涪陵發現大批女飛賊，積案纍纍，無從偵緝。據曾在月夜窺見者言，「均爲矯健女郞，頭帶抹額，衣緊袖襖，蛇行屋上，一瞥而逝。」這眞像舊小說中的所謂飛行劍客，豈川省尙有此類人物耶？</p>
<p>據說涪陵多女賊，妙擅飛簷走壁，飄忽難偵緝，怪裝月夜蛇行疾！</p>
<p>豈是摩登雌劍客，也逐潮流變格：卑劣惟貪得，東偷西盜良心黑！</p>
<h3>伊朗種種</h3>
<p>— 林林</p>
<p>伊朗有着比德法西三國面積的總和還的地方，在世界上可算是個大國；但她的人口却少得可憐，祇有八百萬至一千六百萬之間。</p>
<p>理論上，伊朗她個君主立憲並且有一個國民大會的國家，然而實際上她是一個二千富戶支配下的國家，這二千富戶擁有土地，他們就是內閣，他們就是國民大會。他們把持着財政和軍隊；而他們以大部國家歲入撥充軍費，合憲警公帑約佔百分之五十。因此，伊朋的經濟情形很不安定。有嚴重的通貨膨脹，旺盛的黑市，和囤積居奇的奸商。</p>
<p>伊朗王穆默德，里柴，巴里維是以浪漫出名的；今年才二十八歲，面色蒼白，眼眶多水。他元全在宮內專制獨斷的空氣中成長。但他却是一個溫順而和善的靑年，這和他的野蠻的老王適成反比。他曾到歐洲留學五年，熟習了英法和歐洲各國的禮儀。他登上賽座是在一九四三年那一年。</p>
<p>自從大流士與居魯的日子以來，伊朗國勢衰老得多了，它那種山嶺和沙漢對照的景色非常明媚。但一千多萬人民中只有少數生活奢侈淫靡；人的貧富懸殊得有如天壤之別。人民患梅毒的不下七百萬人，約佔全人口之半；大部份人抽雅片。每五個小孩有四個在嬰兒時就夭折了；四個人中間有三個是文肓。</p>
<p>直至今日，伊朗還只有兩個政黨——公民黨和反士德的國家意志運動黨。公民黨是親蘇，是一九四三年於蘇聯扶持下組成的，其份子為工人，農人和智識份子等，活躍在伊朗北部。國家意志黨為回教徒，地主和伊朗的保守份子所擁護，在伊朋南部活躍，其對外政策是親英反蘇。而這兩黨始終沒有辦法合作，以致黨　頗仍。</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐於牛</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>大概是因爲受到西班牙人的影響，美國民間有許多風俗習慣，脫不了西班牙人好勇鬥狠的性氣，舉一個例來說，盛行美國中部及南部的Rodeo便完全是西歐風味，那個字也根本不是英文，什麽呌做Rodeo呢，是野牛野馬的大競賽。美國中部及南部許多山林間還繁殖着不少野牛野馬，雖經擒獲而野性難馴，法馭御，野牛野馬賽會一定的季節舉行，地點都在郊外，因為需用數百英畝的曠塲，臨時搭起看台及圍欄，參加表演的騎師須先報名登記，他們及她們都是遠道而來得，好像我國的南北名伶，特地趕某地去堂會。騎師都是十年的經騐，表演之日，觀衆購票入座，牛馬都編有號碼，騎師所穿着五顏六色五花八門收童裝，半高統鎭花皮靴，　　　，綉花紡綢襯衫，關邊呢帽，打扮得有些像武松殺嫂中的五都頭，在掌聲如日聲中，騎著野馬或野牛笑　而出，不消三秒鐘，那野獸已把騎師摔在地上，如果在若干秒內不被摔下來，那騎師彼有冠軍希望。騎師中也有不少妙齡小姐在內，她們雖然生的花容月貌，卻又力大如牛，她們能從馬背上擒住野牛的牛，聳身而下，把野牛簽倒，再用組麻繩把野牛困成一團，她那一般勁兒，眞使偉丈夫甘拜下風，憑她的兩條玉臂，就可把一個普通男子拌出十丈以外。所以你在美國藉結交女朋友，須得打聽清除，如果她是Rodeo選，你　是藏拙爲妙，否則不能使她滿意時，一腳跌下床來，一定是吃不了兜著走美國小姐平時　著救　裝上學大都是騎馬能手，上跌　得，豆腐少吃為妙。（十）（七）</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Begins Preparations; Principle for Estimated Expenses Decided; Preparatory Committee Approves Work Outline</h3>
<p>"Our Nanjing dispatch of the 27th" The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly announced its establishment on the 27th. The first meeting was held at 11:00 a.m. on the same day. Chairman Sun Ke presided, with Vice Chairmen Zhang Ji, Zeng Qi, Xu Fulin, and Mo Dehui, and Committee Members Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, etc., all in attendance. They discussed and passed the following proposals: A. Organizational regulations for the Preparatory Committee's secretariat, reception, security, and other departments. B. Principles for estimating the assembly's expenses. C. An outline of the preparatory work.</p>
<p>"Another dispatch" The outline of the National Assembly's preparatory work, having been approved by the Preparatory Committee on the 27th, includes the following key points:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the arrangement of the assembly venue and all buildings: The assembly hall will utilize existing facilities, emphasizing solemnity, beauty, and economy. A building will be constructed to the left of the venue for representatives' lounges. Offices will also be built in the plaza on the left side.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the reception and social interaction of assembly representatives: A registration group will be established at the reception area for representative registration. The daily food allowance for representatives will be between 100,000 and 150,000 yuan. For representative accommodation, large buildings in the city will be rented and a portion of hotels controlled. Representatives not staying there will receive a daily accommodation fee of 150,000 to 250,000 yuan. 80 to 100 large buses will be rented from the Ministry of Communications' Highway Administration and automobile companies for representative transportation needs, along with 30 small cars. Parking will be found separately. Fuel will be ordered in advance from Shanghai Shishan Oil Company. Reception stations for representatives will be set up in various locations, requesting the Ministry of Communications to instruct its transportation agencies to prioritize ticket purchases for them.</p>
<p>C. Regarding the convening of meetings and deliberation: Various regulations for the assembly will be drafted in advance or methods established for reference.</p>
<p>D. Regarding assembly security: A separate plan will be drafted, referencing the actual situation from last year.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Preparatory Committee decided on the National Assembly's expenditures on the 27th. The principle is based on a one-month period, calculating: Representative reception expenses account for 56% of the total, including travel expenses at 19%, public expenses at 6%, accommodation expenses at 9%, food expenses at 7%, reception station expenses at 8%, and special expenses at 7%. Equipment expenses account for 22% of the total, including assembly hall equipment expenses at 5%, dining equipment expenses at 9%, and transportation equipment expenses at 8%. Deliberation expenses account for 14% of the total. Administrative expenses account for 8%. This session has 3,039 representatives, an 80% increase compared to the last assembly. Train and plane ticket prices have increased by over 2,000% compared to last year, and food, accommodation, and miscellaneous expenses have increased by around 1,500%. Calculating on a per capita basis, the last assembly's reception fee was 2.6 million yuan per person, while this time it should be 21 million yuan. However, because this assembly's session is shorter, the increase is not that large. Regarding equipment, in addition to making maximum use of last year's original equipment, additional food and accommodation equipment, construction of lounges capable of accommodating 2,000 people, additional parking lots, and rental of buses are needed.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It is estimated that each participating representative can receive 3 million yuan in public expenses and 4.5 million yuan in accommodation expenses during the National Assembly, along with over 3.6 million yuan in food expenses, all calculated on a one-month basis. Representative travel expenses are calculated based on the region from which the representative was elected, including travel expenses in addition to train and plane ticket costs. Overseas representatives, calculated based on the number of representatives and their location, require over 180,000 US dollars in total. The Preparatory Committee intends to request approval of foreign exchange, to be paid based on the actual number of attendees.</p>
<h3>Official Announcement to Prevail Regarding Elected Female and Occupational National Assembly Delegates; Statement from the National Occupational and Women's Election Office</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th" The National Occupational and Women's Election Office recently announced: The National Assembly representative elections for national occupational and women's groups have been completed as scheduled. Elected and alternate candidates from national joint elections must wait until all provincial and municipal reports are received, verified, and tallied before being announced. This announcement date should legally be December 3rd. Before the official announcement from this office, scattered publications of vote counts from various locations, not having been reviewed by this office, should not be compiled and relied upon.</p>
<h3>Coordination of Candidates for Legislative Yuan Between the Two Parties Awaits Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates from the Min[shendang] and Qing[niandang] parties was still under discussion on the 27th and has not reached a final conclusion, so it has not been submitted to the Election Headquarters for announcement. However, an agreement has been reached on the principle of regional allocation. Today, both the Kuomintang and the Min[shendang] and Qing[niandang] parties held Central Standing Committee meetings separately, discussing only the coordination of candidates. Therefore, this work may be completed on the 28th and submitted to the Election Headquarters for announcement.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Yu Youren Elected as National Assembly Delegates for Taigu and Sanyuan Respectively</h3>
<p>Our Taiyuan dispatch of the 27th" Kong Xiangxi was elected as the National Assembly delegate for Taigu.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th" President Yu Youren has been elected as a National Assembly delegate in his hometown of Sanyuan. (News of ballot counting from various locations on the second section, second column.)</p>
<h3>Our Attitude Towards the Current Government of Siam Under Consideration; Siamese Ambassador Ignores Dismissal Order</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 27th] Since the news of Siamese Ambassador Durarale's dismissal by the new government of Siam reached here, all parties have paid close attention. The reporter corps has especially focused on the expression of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but up to the time of this reporter's dispatch, there was still no news. However, according to reliable sources, this matter is under the careful consideration of Foreign Minister Wang. After Durarale learned of his dismissal announced by the current government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the press, he told this newspaper's reporter that he had not yet received notification from Bangkok. However, he had anticipated this result since he made it clear that he would not obey the current government's laws. Durarale smiled and pointed to the silver box containing his credentials, saying, "My credentials are still here, acknowledged and accepted by the Chinese government. If the Chinese government recognizes the current government of Siam, I will naturally return to my country and retire to the countryside. Until then, I will ignore it and continue to perform my duties." Durarale declined to comment on whether the current government is likely to be recognized by other countries, only smiling and saying, "This can be seen from the treatment received by their representatives sent to Baguio to attend the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. In any case, the current government came to power by force rather than legally."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Speech: The United States Should Value China's Situation</h3>
<p>"Our report" New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington dispatch. Today is Thanksgiving. China's representative to the United Nations, Gu Weijun, gave a 15-minute broadcast speech on CBS, strongly advocating that the United States should value China's situation based on the Marshall Plan and provide rapid assistance. Gu said: The Marshall Plan has great significance for the recovery of the world. China and the Far East are also among the regions that need this assistance, because China not only needs to rebuild its economy, but is also facing the threat of the expansion of communist forces. Gu still held an optimistic attitude toward the United Nations organization, believing that this organization is the only major gain after World War II and believing that once the international security force is established, it will be able to take on the responsibility of maintaining world peace.</p>
<h3>Far East Economic Commission in Stalemate; Siamese Representative Angrily Departs; The Commission has Allowed Siam to Join</h3>
<p>[United Press, Baguio, 27th] The Far East Economic Commission on the 27th has allowed Siam to join as a member. However, two Siamese representatives said they have firmly decided to take the opportunity to return home. The Commission discussed Siam's membership on the 26th for two and a half hours, but no resolution was reached. The Siamese representatives said they felt "annoyed" by this delay. At noon on the 27th, Executive Secretary Lokanathan urgently telegraphed the Loakan Airport to persuade the Siamese representatives to stop their departure, saying, "Siam can participate." However, the Siamese representatives said they had made a decision and could not be persuaded to return after returning home. Philippine representative Guade told the United Press that he had telegraphed the Siamese consul in Manila, Pan Jins, to make a final effort to persuade the Siamese representatives to return to Baguio. He said the Philippine delegation hoped that Bangkok would change its instructions. The US representative suggested allowing Siam to participate, and the UK supplemented that allowing their participation was not "any step by the Committee's countries to recognize the Siamese government." The British and American proposal passed with eight votes in favor and one against. France abstained, and the Soviet Union opposed.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Approves Temporary Domestic Sale of Some Export Goods</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th" Some export goods have now been approved by the Executive Yuan for temporary domestic sale and transportation. Export goods such as pork bristles, feathers, sausage casings, goatskins, gallnuts, tung oil, ramie, raw silk, and waste silk can be transported inland from Wuchang to various locations in Chenxian via the Yuehan Railway. The Executive Yuan has now approved temporary inland transportation and sale, but the consigning merchant must obtain a formal certificate from the chamber of commerce at the railway station where the consignment is made, proving where the goods are being transported to domestically, for what purpose, and guaranteeing that they will not be exported. The certificate must be sent to the stationmaster of the railway station for verification before loading.</p>
<h3>$60 Million Aid to China Case Can Be Passed by US Congress Immediately</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Washington, 26th" The House Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation to include $60 million in aid to China in the emergency aid plan for Italy, France, and Austria is believed to be able to pass in Congress. If the House and Senate proceed with discussions according to the original procedure, the relief fund for China can be voted on in mid-December when the Congress special session completes its work on emergency foreign aid issues. The period of use for the $60 million aid to China is until March of next year, while the State Department's $300 million plan covers the 15-month period from April of next year to June 1949. Supporters of emergency aid to China do not expect that this $60 million can enable Nanjing to defeat the Communist Party, nor do they believe that the money can allow China to overcome its current economic crisis. However, they firmly believe that this is the first time Congress has appropriated funds to aid China, and anything that has begun, no matter how small, is better than not beginning at all. In addition, it is learned that before the House committee took action on this aid, Professor Mike McGowan of political science at Northwestern University warned the members of the committee that US aid to China was extremely necessary. He said that US aid could assure the Chinese people that they have the American people as their backing in their struggle against the Communist Party. China needs 1 to 1.5 billion US dollars and will need several months to restore its economy. Mr. Mai urged that an emergency aid of 60 to 70 million US dollars be given to China immediately, and said that this money would have an unparalleled impact on "restoring China's confidence, popular morale, and making China willing to help itself." Mr. Mai also suggested that this temporary aid be used to the greatest extent to "stabilize the currency."</p>

<h3>Brian Supports Dewey's Proposal for Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Brian, chairman of the fundraising campaign committee for the United Aid to China Association, expressed his support for Governor Dewey's call for economic aid to China. He pointed out that the Chinese people are more numerous than the Europeans and have suffered from the ravages of war for longer than the Europeans. China's need for assistance is even more urgent than that of Europe. He went on to say: The United Aid to Europe and its seven affiliated organizations will follow the correct path indicated by Dewey to assist China, that is, to assist China in training farmers in scientific methods to increase their food production, to assist Chinese workers in opening small-scale industrial cooperatives in rural areas, and to enable Chinese universities to continue to operate so as to train leaders and doctors for China. We have a better understanding of the meaning of US economic aid to China in China than any other organization in the United States, because we feel that the future of China and the United States is closely related. Therefore, we sincerely agree with Dewey's call for temporary economic aid to China. Brian is a famous banker in New York and was formerly the chairman of the United Aid to China Association.</p>

<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>Impropriety of Advocating the Opening of Inland River Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xuejiang</p>
<p>The English-language *Continental Daily News* published an article entitled "Yangtze River Shipping" advocating the opening of inland river navigation rights. Its reasons were: 1. Temporarily allowing foreign ships to navigate the Yangtze River could reduce upstream freight costs, which would help exports; 2. After the opening of inland river navigation rights, British merchants would benefit, and China's economy would benefit even more significantly; 3. If a foreign government were to demand the opening of inland river navigation rights by force, it would be a violation of sovereignty, but it would be a different matter if the Chinese government were to invite it voluntarily. Its conclusion was that the Chinese government should immediately allow foreign ships to navigate inland rivers for the sake of overall economic benefits, otherwise it would only allow a small number of merchants to monopolize the industry, which would not benefit the country at all.</p>
<p>When we carefully analyze the meaning of the *Continental Daily News*, it is no different from advocating for British merchants. At that time, the British parliamentary delegation to China expressed the intention to regain inland river navigation rights in our country. However, its reasons are very superficial. For example, it claims that temporarily allowing foreign ships to navigate inland rivers does not harm national sovereignty, and that it cannot be considered a violation of sovereignty if the Chinese government invites it voluntarily rather than being demanded by foreign force. It must be understood that sovereignty is extremely valuable and cannot be given away; if it is given away, how can it be said that there is no harm? And how can it be said that there is no violation? As for the claim that upstream freight costs can be reduced and exports can be increased after foreign ships navigate inland rivers, this is also a specious argument. Because foreign ships navigating inland rivers also require fuel consumption, repairs and depreciation, employee expenses, management fees, and tax payments. Since it is said that "British merchants will certainly benefit," it can be seen that it has not deviated from the scope of profit-making, and it may not necessarily be able to reduce freight costs independently. Now, British ships traveling to and from Hong Kong and Shanghai have not been heard to have lower freight costs than Chinese merchants, which is ironclad proof. Even if British ships lower their prices to compete in the Yangtze River shipping industry, it will be of little benefit to the export of local products and will be harmful to the entire national economy. Why? Because no matter how low the freight costs are, what we pay is the foreign exchange that British merchants use to exchange. The deficit in foreign exchange positions is well known. Now, import and export goods are mostly carried by foreign ships, which increases the expenditure of foreign exchange, which is already regrettable. Now, even the inland river freight costs must be paid in foreign exchange. Is this really in the interest of the country? Moreover, British merchants have been planning this for a long time, and past facts can be used as a warning. At the beginning of the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, its sole business was transporting tribute grain. Later, it acquired all the assets of Russell &amp; Company, and its business flourished, which greatly alarmed British merchants. They abused the means of lowering prices and recklessly suppressed it. At that time, if Li Hongzhang had not fully protected it and only focused on the small calculation of reducing freight costs, then the tribute grain transport business would have been seized by British merchants. Also, in the past, when foreign merchants enjoyed inland river navigation rights in China, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire created the Freight Pool system and the Lower Yangtze Shipping Conference, which severely restricted the participation of Chinese merchants. Those who failed to participate were defeated. For this reason, the Chinese shipping industry has been difficult to develop. The same mistakes are still there, and we must take them as a warning.</p>
<p>As for the current sluggishness of our country's exports, it is certainly a fact. However, there are many factors, and it cannot be entirely blamed on freight costs, especially not entirely on inland river freight costs. Today, there are many local products for export in the interior that no one cares about, and there are even more local products for export stored in Shanghai's warehouses that cannot be exported. Before the price difference between domestic and foreign goods is still large and the import restrictions of various countries have not been relaxed, it is certainly not easy to promote exports. In terms of shipping, it is regrettable that there is still a lack of large ships that can open up ocean routes to save foreign exchange expenditure on freight costs. This is what we should all work together to achieve.</p>
<p>The so-called monopoly originally refers to a business that is only allowed to be handled exclusively by a certain professional agency. Today, there are more than one hundred shipping companies in China. All Chinese citizens have the right to form companies to navigate within the country. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and private shipping companies have the same rights and obligations. It is not comparable to the British merchants who used to navigate our country's inland rivers, who only enjoyed the right to navigate without the obligation to pay taxes. Therefore, in terms of the entire shipping industry, no one can talk about monopoly. If it is said that all undertakings will inevitably be monopolized if foreign merchants do not participate, then should our country's postal service and salt administration also be shared with foreign merchants to enjoy their benefits, and then can it be said that it is not monopolized?</p>
<p>If it is said that Chinese merchants can arbitrarily raise freight prices because there is no competition from foreign merchants, this is also an ignorant statement. Shipping is one of the public utilities, and any increase or decrease in passenger fares and freight charges is subject to the approval of the transportation authorities. Although the transportation authorities make reasonable adjustments from time to time based on the shipping industry's expenditures on fuel, wages, repairs, and interest, the time-sensitive adjustments are not as fast as the currency depreciation and the increase in other prices. Therefore, those who are familiar with the content of the shipping industry all know the difficulties faced by today's shipping companies. Foreign merchants also operate public utilities in Shanghai, and their rates have been adjusted many times. They are truly monopolized operators. Can they also be regarded as monopolies?</p>
<p>Our country's shipping industry has been unable to revive for many years due to the restrictions of unequal treaties. Now that inland river navigation rights have just been recovered and the shipping industry has just turned a corner, all of us Chinese people should encourage and advocate for rapid catching up. We hope that everyone will face the facts and express correct opinions so that the nascent Chinese shipping industry will no longer be destroyed. This will not only be a blessing for the Chinese shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Joint Annual Meeting of Agricultural Academic Organizations – Original Text of the Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1)</p>
<p>"China is a country founded on agriculture. All political, economic, and social activities depend on the support of the vast countryside. The advancement of industrialization must be based on agriculture in order to be completed. In recent years, the countryside has been declining, and signs of distress are becoming increasingly apparent. Even the food supply is difficult to meet on its own. On a small scale, farmers' savings are empty, increasing social unrest; on a large scale, it damages national strength and cannot respond to world changes, which is a cause for great concern. It is imperative to strive to solve the problem of rural land, and to fully promote the improvement of agricultural production technology, the abundance of agricultural finance, the improvement of agricultural soil, the development of farmland water conservancy, and the guidance of rural social progress, first to seek agriculture to be able to stand firm and be self-sufficient, and then to plan for development. With China's abundant natural endowments, if we can add sincere and unremitting human effort and strive for progress every day, it will not be difficult to make our people well-fed and clothed, and bring the country to a prosperous and happy realm. However, this matter is of great importance, and it must be led by those who are enlightened and enlightened, leading all our innocent and simple farmers to carry out practical progress in order to have accurate and effective reforms. This is what is meant by the unity of knowledge and action.

After a night of wind and so on yesterday, the temperature in Changchun City has dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius, creating the highest peak of severe cold since the winter began. However, according to people who have lived in Changchun for a long time, judging from this year's season, the temperature may continue to drop by 10 to 12 degrees in the future. Currently, hundreds of thousands of residents in the city are in a state of fuel shortage. They have been constantly excavating in nearby areas for the past half year since the communists launched their fifth offensive, and they once burned the coal remains that had not been turned to ashes as a passive resistance to the communists' destruction of industry and mining. At present, except for the garrison headquarters, various banks, and Changchun University, which have begun burning heating systems, the rest of the agencies in the city are spending the winter with stoves in more than 20 buildings with three or more floors.</p>

<p>"Further dispatch" Commodity prices in the city have continued to rise, and the length of its duration and the intensity of the rise are unprecedented.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Assembly Continues Meeting to Hear Government Reports</h3>

For the education budget, from October of the 34th year [of the Republic] to November of this year, the central government only allocated 1.95 billion yuan in rehabilitation funds and 800 million yuan in temporary construction funds this year, which, when distributed throughout the province, is truly a drop in the bucket.

Relief: Over the past two years, the central government has allocated 9.4 billion yuan in relief funds, and 950,000 people have been provided with relief.

<h3>First Chief Prosecutor of the Tianjin High Court Branch, Chen Sizhe, Knowingly Violates the Law; Supervisory Group Sends Letter to the Ministry of Justice Requesting Detention</h3>
<p>"This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 27th" The Beiping-Tianjin-Hebei Supervisory Group announced today: Chen Sizhe, the chief prosecutor of the Tianjin High Court Branch Procuratorate, had illicit relations with Shen Xiulan, the mistress of a suspected traitor, Zhang Jiayun, and had received a building from a suspected traitor, Han Baozhen.

<h3>Spring Silkworm Cocoon Purchase Price Increased; Loan for Silk Reeling Workers Increased by 10 Billion</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 27th] The purchase price of spring silkworm cocoons was previously tentatively set at 31 million yuan per dan (a unit of weight), with the Central Farmers Bank providing advance payment and suspending interest calculation. The loan for silk reeling workers was also tentatively set at 1 million yuan per dan, totaling 84 billion yuan based on a tentative calculation of 14,000 dan of spring silkworm cocoons. The Four Joint Offices were to handle the matter according to the goods and forward the letter to the Central Farmers Bank. However, due to the recent surge in prices and the increase in the cost of living for silk reeling workers, as well as the soaring prices of fuels such as diesel and coal used for silk reeling power, the original 6 million yuan per dan for silk reeling labor costs was far from sufficient. The advance payment for purchasing silkworm cocoons should also be increased. The three regional silk reeling trade associations repeatedly forwarded applications from various lending manufacturers, requesting the Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee to make adjustments. After a meeting, the committee decided to increase the advance payment for silkworm cocoon purchases to 35 million yuan per dan and the loan for silk reeling workers to 10 million yuan per dan, increasing the total loan amount by 10 billion yuan. The committee has reported this to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and sent a letter to the Four Joint Offices and the Central Farmers Bank for handling.</p>

<h3>Important Documents Seized by National Army in Shandong; A Letter from a Communist Bandit Cadre (Continued) Sincerely States to Superiors That Military Morale Has Collapsed</h3>
<p>Pessimism: Most of the soldiers who joined the army are downcast and silent, refusing to eat. Some are looking for their fellow villagers everywhere. When they see that their family members have been injured or killed, they wail loudly or sleep all day long. Some soldiers who have just joined the army cry and say, "I'm the only one left. I don't know when I'll die. The corpses of my fellow villagers can't even return home. It's so pitiful!" Some of the old soldiers eat and drink heavily. A squad leader said, "If you don't eat in this era, you don't know when you'll die?" Among the liberated soldiers, they don't believe that we can win the counterattack. They say, "If you eliminate the 26th Division, another 26th Division will come. If you eliminate the 72nd Division, another 72nd Division will come. The National Army will never be defeated, and they also have Americans providing assistance, and their equipment is getting better and better." They also say, "The Communist Party can't beat the central government at all. What happened in Tai'an in the past was just a fluke!" Therefore, the newly liberated soldiers are fleeing one after another. More than 120 people from the 22nd Regiment of the 8th Division deserted overnight. This is not counting the fact that special agents are also instigating them, and individuals are running away with machine guns on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Laxity: Cadres no longer care about problems such as desertion, lagging behind, or violations of discipline. A platoon leader said, "It's not exciting to be a squad leader and lead two or three soldiers, especially when marching." The 3rd Transport of the 26th Regiment randomly arrests civilians to carry backpacks, and the cadres don't care. Even a political commissar of the 27th Regiment, Yang Honghui, cried loudly and didn't ask about work.</p>
<p>Waiting for Reorganization: Inquiring about news and submitting reports are common sentiments everywhere. The "life-saving mentality" has also developed among cadres. There are six or seven people feigning illness and requesting rest. In the 9th Division (entirely), there are two at the battalion level, three at the company level, and two at the platoon level (three political workers). After the 4th Column arrived here from southern Shandong, they finally took a breath, but their thinking is very confused. The first is the expression of left and right-leaning sentiments. For example, a platoon leader said, "If you can't be killed in battle, you'll be killed by running away. If you can't be killed by running away, you'll be killed by starvation." Seventeen prisoners from the 4th Transport of the 31st Regiment organized an escape, taking ten guns with them, including two party members. The second is that the situation is unclear, and they don't believe in the victory of Liu Deng's (referring to Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, Deng being the political commissar of Liu's unit) army, saying, "Counterattack, counterattack, and Shandong is lost!" This area is not large, with the Yellow River on the northwest, the Grand Canal on the east, and the Longhai Railway on the south. We can't withstand the enemy's encirclement and suppression. If we win (referring to the opposite), we will have fewer people, lose our guns, and transfer to other people's areas. The 3rd Column has methods for attacking cities, but Jinan has not been taken. There are gunshots everywhere. The enemy is chasing us closely, and we are the "escape column"! The discipline of the 32nd Regiment is terrible, manifested in (A) beating and scolding local cadres; (B) randomly demanding grain, grass, and civilian laborers; (C) forcibly buying things and forcibly pulling livestock; (D) individual rape of women. Local government cadres run away when they see the southern troops, and the common people also avoid them. Comrade Lai Shaoqi wrote in a letter, "Our discipline is too bad! There is no way to do political work. The propaganda work is done, and now we can only use beheading to maintain it. Commander Chen (referring to Chen Yi) calculated everything, except for food. There are no shoes to walk in. So, because things are lost in the formation, there are many who sigh and regret the past all day long. In addition, there is a lot of beating and scolding in the troops. In the 32nd Regiment, except for the political commissar, deputy political commissar, and the political instructor of the 3rd Battalion, everyone else has been beaten. The 7th Transport soldiers reflect: If the regimental commander beats people again next time, we will run away, damn it."</p>
<p>Now, the cadres above the regimental level have a clear request, which is "replenishment and recuperation." In fact, if we continue to fight like this, we will collapse.</p>
<p>The enemy's plane is coming again, and gunfire has started! I will stop writing here and pay my respects. Your subordinate, Wang Danian, the 13th. (End) (Special Correspondent, 24th)</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Begin Discussing German Peace Treaty; Border Issues to Cause Disputes; Foreign Minister Representatives Discuss Austrian Issue</h3>
<p>"This newspaper dispatch" London, 27th Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers Conference will hold its third meeting this afternoon, chaired by Marshall. Marshall will force Molotov to discuss the German border issue, with particular emphasis on the German-Polish border. According to reports, Molotov expressed his views on the German peace treaty yesterday, advocating for a swift signing of the peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a strong German central government to replace the current Four-Power military government. His purpose is clearly to ingratiate himself with the German people as a form of propaganda offensive. Marshall's intention in raising the border issue is to strike a blow against the Soviet Union's propaganda. As is well known, the Soviet Union firmly insists on establishing the German-Polish border based on the Potsdam Agreement, a point that is clearly unpopular with the German people. Moreover, the Soviet Union has also expressed opposition to the incorporation of the Saar region into France and does not approve of any changes to Germany's western border. After Marshall raises the border issue, the Soviet Union will be forced to clarify its position on this thorny issue.</p>
<p>"United Press, London, 27th" The Soviet Union's delayed agreement to the British and American acceleration of discussions on the German peace treaty has created an atmosphere of cautious optimism at the Foreign Ministers Conference. Even those who take the most skeptical attitude towards the Soviet Union's motives admit that Molotov's public expression of the need to consider the German peace treaty as soon as possible is a major step forward, a shift in the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Bidault is prepared to raise the explosive issue of Germany's western border at today's meeting and will once again insist that the four powers must agree that the Saar belongs to France. The debate on the border issue may reveal what concessions the Soviet Union is willing to make in order to achieve an early conclusion of the German peace treaty. The Soviet Union has consistently insisted on participating in the control of the Ruhr region, a point that the United Kingdom and the United States have refused to accept, while also opposing France's proposal to separate the Ruhr from Germany and place it under international administration. In the discussion of the German border issue, France may support the Soviet Union and will insist on changing the Potsdam understanding, while the United Kingdom and the United States want to return some agricultural areas east of the Oder and Neisse rivers to Germany.</p>
<p>"Reuters, London, 26th" The impasse at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian issue was broken today. It has now been agreed to place the Austrian issue as the first item on the agenda. After a brief discussion, the four foreign ministers agreed on the following agenda order: The Austrian peace treaty proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France; the German peace treaty, including procedural and border issues; the future economic principles of Germany; the form and scope of the German provisional government; a review of the implementation of the disarmament measures decided at the Moscow Conference; and the Four-Power Anti-German Pact proposed by the United States. The Austrian issue has been handed over to the special representatives of the four foreign ministers for discussion. The representatives appointed by each foreign minister are as follows: Dodge of the United States, Marjorie Pinks of the United Kingdom, General Chilier of France, and Koktomov of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"Associated Press, London, 26th" A debate occurred at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accused Western countries of hindering the conclusion of the German peace treaty, intending to enslave small and weak nations with imperialism, and intending to manipulate the German economy to cultivate its military potential. British Foreign Minister Bevin replied, "We are clearly all war profiteers, and the only saint in the world is the Soviet Union." French Foreign Minister Bidault said that Mr. Molotov's words were unlikely to contribute to harmony. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall also replied in a short speech, saying, "Mr. Molotov probably does not believe his own words. We had better be realistic and not judge others by our own standards. This is just a matter of propaganda. We must immediately start work in a reasonable manner and establish an agreement for the benefit of the whole world." The opening remarks of the second day of the conference thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Benelux Presents Memorandum; German Issues Closely Related to Their Interests; Four Powers Should Not Make Any Decisions Without Consent</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, London, 26th" The three Benelux countries presented a joint memorandum to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today, expressing their views on the political and economic future of Germany. The three governments emphasized that the general resolution of the German issue and the special resolution of the Ruhr issue should not be decided by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference without the consent of Benelux. The memorandum emphasized the importance of preventing the use of German economic power to threaten the political balance of Europe and suggested two main strategies: international control of the Ruhr industrial area and the gradual restoration of German political responsibility within the framework of a federal constitution. The three governments demanded the right to participate in the international control of the Ruhr industrial area and demanded the right to attend meetings during the period of international joint management of Germany. The three governments value the security of the three countries, avoiding possible future aggression from Germany, but economically do not want to see a large reduction in Germany's economic capacity, except for typically destructive machinery and raw materials.</p>
<h3>Austrian People Express Relief</h3>

<h3>German Communists Plan to Elect Representatives to Present Opinions on the Peace Treaty</h3>

<h3>U.S. Loan Balance to the United Kingdom Unlikely to Be Unfrozen in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder reportedly said that whether the United States will unfreeze the balance of the loan to the United Kingdom is unlikely to be decided in the next few weeks. A reporter asked if it was true that there would be no action on this issue until Congress resolves the emergency aid to Europe issue. Mr. Snyder declined to comment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 26th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps confirmed on the 26th that the United Kingdom will soon be able to draw the final $400 million remaining in the Anglo-American loan. However, he said that this matter must wait for the United States to make a statement first.</p>

<p>"This newspaper dispatch" New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington News, the US Senate yesterday rejected cutting $197 million in emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria, but a group of senators opposed giving aid to foreign countries casually and raised various amendments, so the hope of a final vote on Thanksgiving Day has fallen through.</p>
<h3>French Labor Strikes Increasingly Widespread; Workers Reject Government's Wage Increase Plan; Rumors of Communist Attempt to Launch Coup</h3>
<p>"Associated Press, Paris, 27th" Prime Minister Schuman is scheduled to report to Parliament this afternoon on how to deal with the labor strikes and request approval, but there are many scheduled speakers, and it is still unknown whether a vote can be held today.</p>
<p>"Associated Press, Paris, 26th" The number of striking workers in France today is close to two million, and there have been sporadic riots in various places. In the northern coal mining strike center of Lerry and in some places in eastern France, strikers and non-strikers have clashed. The general railway strike is already underway. The General Confederation of Labor branch in Alpin town, Annecy Province, has called on all its members in the area to go on strike, which is the beginning of a general strike of all trade unions. Prime Minister Schuman used radio broadcasts to appeal to the strikers to return to work, saying that the present is a difficult period in French history and asking all workers to examine their conscience. He also said that strikers will not be paid during the strike period and said that many of the strikes are for political purposes. Mr. Schuman promised striking workers in Paris an immediate temporary increase of 1,500 francs (approximately US$12) per month to cope with the high cost of living. The strikers demanded a minimum wage increase of US$32 per month. The 18 trade unions belonging to the General Confederation of Labor immediately rejected the government's proposal, and 21 other trade unions must hold meetings to decide whether to accept the conditions or join the strike.</p>
<p>"Associated Press, Paris, 26th" Striking workers in Lyon, France, held a large demonstration on the 26th and were dispersed by police with tear gas. There are widespread rumors that the Communist Party plans to use the labor strikes as a springboard to seize power. It is rumored that 30,000 French standing troops have been recalled to the country from Germany and North Africa in the past week and stationed in Paris, Marseille, Lerry, Lyon, and other centers of turmoil. It is rumored that troops in the Rhineland are preparing to move out immediately, and the border guards have sealed off the French-Spanish and French-Italian borders to prevent the possible infiltration of new "international teams." U.S. Ambassador Caffery visited Mr. Schuman at the Prime Minister's Office at 5 PM on the 26th. Mr. Schuman's duty officer said that this was a "normal visit and had no political significance."</p>
<h3>France and the Soviet Union Sign Barter Agreement; Soviet Union Will Ship Large Quantities of Grain to France</h3>

<h3>Truman's Anti-Inflation Measures: Republicans Still Oppose; Martin Indicates Tax Cut Bill Will Be Reintroduced</h3>
<p>"Associated Press, New York, 26th" Since the "Marshall Plan battle" began in Congress on the 17th of this month, its lineup has become very clear, namely that this case is a dispute over strengthening government control versus reducing government control.</p>
<p>Now seeing the Republican-controlled Congress ending various economic and commercial controls with a considerable advantage, the Democratic government's opposition is ineffective, and the matter has come to a conclusion; however, the Economic Advisory Committee's report to President Truman has brought up the old issues again. The control measures proposed in the report include the allocation of domestic and foreign supplies, the prevention of speculation, and comprehensive anti-inflation measures to offset extreme needs, which are continued heavy taxation, reduced or expanded credit loans, etc. Some of these measures were abolished by the Republican Congress in the previous session. Republicans are still striving to lift other controls, with the primary goal of reducing individual income taxes. Truman vetoed these twice during the previous session, but House Speaker Martin (Republican) stated yesterday that the tax cut bill will be passed before the Congressional recess in June 1948.</p>

<h3>Palestine Partition Plan Encounters Obstacles at the UN General Assembly: Final Vote Postponed to Today</h3>
<p>"Associated Press, Flushing, 26th" The proposal to partition Palestine encountered new opposition in the UN General Assembly today. In a dilemma, supporters of the partition plan finally urged the Assembly to postpone the final vote to the 28th. At the same time, the plan to split the Holy Land into Jewish and Arab states is nearing realization, as the Netherlands and New Zealand announced that they would no longer abstain but intend to vote in favor. The change in the Netherlands' attitude will lead Belgium and Luxembourg to take the same stance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New Zealand representative Berendsen announced after the meeting that, to promote harmony, he would change his stance and vote in favor, but Haiti, Greece, and the Philippines simultaneously announced that they would vote against. If Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands unanimously support partition, the UN General Assembly is almost certain to pass the partition plan by a two-thirds majority. The decision to postpone the vote was the result of both sides pressuring undecided delegations outside the meeting. However, the situation in the Assembly is constantly changing, and so far 28 countries have claimed to support partition, and 15 countries have announced that they will vote against. Eleven countries' representatives will deliver speeches before the General Assembly votes on the 28th.</p>
<h3>We Clarify Our Position</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th" The Foreign Ministry spokesman made a statement to reporters tonight: "Regarding the UN General Assembly's resolution on the Palestine issue, the Chinese government's policy has been from the beginning that its delegation should support any proposal that can be accepted in principle by both parties in the dispute, and will not support any plan that could cause renewed serious conflict and bloodshed. If the Chinese delegation were not particularly concerned about the wishes of the Jewish people, it would oppose the partition plan. For this reason, the Chinese delegation has been instructed to abstain from voting on this issue, but does not intend to vote against it."</p>
<h3>Siamese Emerald Buddha Diamond Stolen</h3>
<p>"Associated Press, Bangkok, 26th" Since the administration of Roong, another shocking incident occurred today: the three-carat diamond inlaid on the forehead of the famous ancient Buddha statue has been stolen. The Buddha is carved from green jade, wears a robe of jewels worth $100,000, and is kept in the Royal Palace temple.

<h3>Japanese Democratic Party Decides to Expel Shidehara Faction from Party</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th" The Japanese Democratic Party has expelled former Prime Minister Shidehara Kijuro and 23 other Democratic Party members because they disobeyed the party's decision and voted against the coal mine nationalization bill last night. The expulsion order issued by the Democratic Party this time is generally considered an extremely drastic action, as this move has reduced the Democratic Party to the third-largest party in the parliament.</p>
<p>"New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th" After the fierce struggle over the coal mine bill in the Japanese House of Representatives, the power of various parties has changed. According to the latest statistics, the Socialist Party has 140 seats, the Democratic Party has 126 seats, the Liberal Party has 120 seats, and the National Cooperative Party has 30 seats; if the situation during the vote on the coal mine bill is considered, 24 members of the Democratic Party's Shidehara faction have left the Democratic Party and joined the Liberal Party, then the Liberal Party may become the largest party in the parliament. However, so far, Shidehara and others have not expressed any intention to defect.</p>

<h3>Final Vote Count for Regional Election to be Determined Today; Fang Zhi and Qian Dajun Have a Difference of Four Hundred Votes</h3>

<h3>Request to Increase Special Treatment Fails; Pilots Suspend Service</h3>
<p>"Report from Our Newspaper" The Shanghai District pilotage matters under the jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs (including pilotage between Shanghai and Outer Tongsasha) involve a total of twenty-two pilots, including twenty foreigners and two Chinese. Pilotage fees have always been calculated in U.S. dollars. Since the government stipulated the exchange rate, settlements have often been made according to the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, but the difference with the black market is very large. The pilots have repeatedly requested, and starting from the first of this month, the Customs stipulated an additional 40% surcharge on pilotage fees. Recently, due to the repeated increase in foreign exchange rates and rising commodity prices, the pilots' livelihoods have been hit again, so they negotiated with the Shanghai District Pilotage Office of the Jianghai Customs, requesting an increase in treatment. The Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs believes that it has only been less than a month since the additional 40% was added on the first of this month, and it is unreasonable to request an adjustment again, which has caused dissatisfaction among all pilots, and they suddenly suspended service starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs immediately discussed with the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the Maritime Affairs Bureau will find a way to maintain the Shanghai District pilotage issue until it is resolved. According to Yang Lin, from the Shanghai District Pilotage Office of the Jianghai Customs, who told reporters, this matter is not serious and is currently being discussed and will be fully resolved within a few days.</p>

<h3>Xiao Ling, Only Eighteen Years Old, Came to Shanghai and Made Her Debut</h3>
<p>When Zhang was questioned, he stated: 41 years old, from Sheng County. Xiao Danggui was bought from a local opera troupe in Sheng County ten years ago, when Xiao was only eighteen years old. Her first performance in Shanghai was at the Empire Theater. He had a relationship with me at the age of 22, and we secretly lived together across from the East Zhejiang Theater at the age of 24. The following year, Xiao entered the International Theater to perform new-style Yue Opera, and last year she established the Cathay Theater to perform regularly. Question: How did you know that Xiao went to the theater with Leng on October 7th? Answer: "On the night of the 7th, Xiao didn't come home until 11 o'clock. I asked her where she came from. She said she went to see a movie with Mrs. Yu's family. I knew that Mrs. Yu's family was watching a play at Cathay that night, and I had met and talked with her, so how could she be watching a movie? So I pursued where she had gone. She said she went with a small hardware dealer, and they had dinner after watching the movie, so she was late." Question: Had she done this before? Answer: No, but many Yue Opera fans often wrote letters to her. Question: What play did Leng Shan direct later? What was the content? Answer: He directed "The Flower of Anger," which was about a concubine being seduced and committing suicide as a result. Question: Is the situation similar to this case? Zhang lowered his head and did not answer. Question: How did you later know that she went to the movies with Leng Shan? Answer: "Later, I persuaded her with kind words, and she admitted that she went to the movies with Leng Shan and said that she had gone to see them several times before. I said it didn't matter if you went to the movies, but it wasn't good for you to communicate using Liu Qiong's mailbox. On the 8th, I asked Wu Jie to call Leng Shan to confront him."</p>
<h3>Minyi Warehouse: Large Quantities of Goods Sealed Off; Employee Detained for One Day as a Warning for Obstructing Official Duties</h3>
<p>"Report from Our Newspaper" Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau received a report that the Minyi No. 2 Warehouse on Dankuei Road in Hongkou was hoarding a large amount of steel wire, steel plates, etc., worth over 10 billion yuan. When police officers were dispatched to investigate, they were refused by Zhang Junqing, an employee of the warehouse, who reported to the nearby police post No. 77</p>
<p>Minyi Warehouse: Large Quantities of Goods Sealed Off 61, falsely accusing them of being bandits. After the police officers showed their identification and duty certificates, they detained Zhang and immediately conducted a search. As a result, in addition to confiscating a large amount of steel wire and steel plates, they also found newsprint and other materials. According to Zhang, the steel plates, etc., were stored by Minfu Enterprise Company, whose head office is located at No. 316 Jiangxi Road, and the manager is named Zhang Xiaoxian. The newsprint was stored by a certain newspaper office, etc. Currently, the police bureau has temporarily sealed off the above-mentioned materials for disposal and has punished Zhang Junqing with one day of detention for obstructing official duties.</p>
<p>Incidental Event</p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Door: The First Person to Rush in Was Detained for Three Hours</h3>
<p>"Report from Our Newspaper" Yesterday, when Zhang Chunfan was tried, there were over 700 spectators, and the court square was filled with them. The Eighth Court could only accommodate 100 people, and those who could not enter made a scene outside the door. The judge then announced a temporary recess. The crowd did not maintain order and broke down the door. The first person to rush in was arrested, sent to a small detention room, and detained for three hours. After Zhang's case was heard, he was temporarily interrogated. This person refused to reveal his name and was ordered to return after being reprimanded. This can be said to be one of the side events.</p>
<h3>At the Court Door, People Surged Like a Tide</h3>
<p>After the testimony had lasted for a quarter of an hour, the noise outside the door became deafening, and the pounding on the door was like thunder, making it impossible to continue the trial. A temporary adjournment was announced. The court door was then opened, and the crowd outside surged in like a tide. Judge Mei asked Chief Procurator Zha whether the hearing should be rescheduled. Chief Procurator Zha instructed him to wait a while, and to resume the hearing after some of the crowd had dispersed. They waited until 4:15 PM, by which time most of the audience had left, leaving only one or two hundred people. After assigning more than ten additional bailiffs, the court reopened and continued questioning Zhang Chunfan. Question: What was the purpose of calling Leng Shan to confront you later? Answer: I was afraid that Leng Shan would spread rumors and slander me outside, so I asked Wu Shen and Liu Tao to find him to explain. Question: How did Xiao Pingri contact Leng? Answer: By phone, and also by communicating through Liu Qiong's mailbox, about seven or eight letters.</p>
<p>Crying, a Chaos of Laughter, Big and Small Question: When you saw Leng Shan, what did you mean when you said, "Dan Gui committed suicide"? Answer: No, I said, "Don't you speak. My woman has told me everything. Tell me the truth." Leng then admitted to going to Jinmen with Xiao to see a movie, and later to Zhaofeng Park to play. Finally, Leng Shan lost his temper, and after Leng Shan did as I said, he left. At this point, I cried loudly, Xiao Dan Gui also cried, and Wu Shen and Liu Tao also cried. We all cried together (the courtroom erupted in laughter). On the afternoon of the 13th, I was still talking and laughing with friends, who would have known that she would commit suicide. Question: Did Xiao Pingri usually perform tragedies or comedies well? Answer: She was good at comedies, not so good at tragedies. Question: Do you know the reason for Xiao's suicide? Answer: I think it was because someone said something to provoke her.</p>
<p>Slap Me and Tell Me the Truth When the questioning reached this point, Leng Shan was summoned. Leng was dressed in gray, with a gray face that matched his clothes. He testified: "I am 30 years old, from Suzhou. I am currently an actor at the Shanghai Experimental Film Factory. The first play I directed after joining Guotai was 'This Hatred is Endless'." Question: How did you become acquainted with Xiao? Answer: At first, we were just ordinary friends. Later, because several actors were very ambitious and willing to study acting with me, Xiao Dan Gui was one of them. Question: How did you contact Xiao at the end of September? Answer: At the end of September, I returned to Shanghai from Suzhou. Xiao called me and asked me to talk. I said I was busy these days, but I would be free in a few days. On October 7th, we agreed to go to Dahua to see "Hibiscus Spring," but it didn't work out. Because it was hot, and there was nowhere to go, we went to Zhaofeng Park for a walk. On October 8th, Zhang Chunfan suddenly came to my house to find me and said he had something to discuss. After getting in the car, he said, "Xiao Dan Gui committed suicide." I was very surprised and asked him. Liu Tao said, "Let's talk about it when we get home." When we arrived at Zhang's house, I saw Xiao sleeping on the bed, without any expression. Zhang then said, "Where did you two rent a room yesterday?" I said, "Are you trying to trick me? First you say she committed suicide, and now you say I rented a room with her?" He became furious, slapped me, and told me to tell Wu Shen the truth. After I told him, Xiao also said, "If I am not innocent, I will commit suicide."</p>
<p>You Are Ordinary, I Am Not</p>
<p>Zhang said, "I will only believe it when you die." Xiao cried, and everyone comforted her. I swore an oath, declaring that I had not done anything wrong, and that was the end of it. But Zhang was still angry, saying, "It's not that easy. I want your Bazi (referring to wanting my life)." As I left, I said, "I will never associate with Xiao Dan Gui again." The next day, I returned to Suzhou. Then Liu Tao was called, who testified that on the morning of October 8th, at 10:00 AM, it was raining. Zhang came to find me, saying that Xiao and Leng Shan had a "close relationship," and asked me and Wu Shen to find Leng Shan together. After finding him, we went to Zhang's house. Leng Shan said, "Seeing a movie is a very ordinary thing." Zhang said, "You are ordinary, I am not." He raised his hand to hit Leng Shan, but only touched his hair. Later, Leng Shan apologized and swore an oath to end the matter. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th, I went to Zhang's house. It wasn't until the evening of the 13th that I learned that Xiao had committed suicide. Finally, Shen Yitao, Wei Meiyun, Chen Delai, Zhou Baokui, Lao Zhennan, Zhou Mingda, Ye Zhicheng, Chen Daqing, Fu Chunlin, and others testified. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning. Xiao's sister, Qian Qiong Yun, and Wu Shen were both absent from court for various reasons. Before the adjournment, Zhang's lawyer requested bail, but it was denied. Zhang Chunfan was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Allocation Time Pressing, Trade Union Requests Extension Non-Labor Dispute, Social Bureau Refuses to Accept</h3>
<p>"Reporting from the News" The Taoist priests of Tongbai Palace, Baiyun Temple, Maoshan Palace, and other temples in this city have been demanding that the temple authorities adjust the treatment for each scripture chanting session, but have not been accepted by the temple authorities. Yesterday, they went on strike and stopped chanting scriptures. Ai Langxuan, the executive director of the Taoist Association, went to the Social Bureau yesterday to request mediation. The Social Bureau stated that the temple masters cannot represent the employers, and the Taoist priests are not employees. This case is not a labor dispute and will not be accepted. The police station should be asked to handle it.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Repatriated Overseas Chinese from South Sakhalin Arrive in Shanghai, Food and Accommodation Become a Problem Overseas Chinese Affairs Agency Lacks Funds. The Mayor Agrees to Provide a Week's Supply</h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The Soviet ship "Gogol" brought 161 repatriated overseas Chinese, men, women, and children, from South Sakhalin yesterday, about 70 of whom were women and children. Among the women, except for six Chinese women, the others were Japanese wives of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese do not admit that there are Japanese among them, because they have already joined Chinese citizenship. An old Shandong man with a Japanese accent said: "We don't want wives who don't want to be Chinese or come to China. These have always been with Chinese." In addition to the Shandong villagers, most of them are overseas Chinese from Zhejiang and Fujian. Most of them were very poor in the past, and they fled abroad alone. Some sold cloth, some worked, some farmed, and some opened restaurants. Slowly, they accumulated some savings and started families locally. The oldest has lived there for more than 30 years, and the youngest has lived there for more than ten years. For decades, they have been living under Japanese rule. However, it is said that the Japanese treated them well, giving them the freedom to do business and not bothering them too much, but they were not allowed to return to their country. Especially those who had wives and children were absolutely not allowed to leave.</p>
<p>After the "Old Maozi" (their name for the Russians) came three years ago, the situation was different. They took away the money, furniture, cattle, and sheep that the overseas Chinese had worked hard to accumulate over the years. However, compared to the Japanese, the Chinese were still lucky, because the "Maozi" soldiers at least did not kill them. They said, "China and the Soviet Union are friendly countries."</p>
<p>The "Maozi" asked the overseas Chinese to work for them, only giving them 15 rubles a day, and they had to take care of their own food and housing, or give them 60 rubles a month and two slices of black bread a day, while rice had to be bought for 150 rubles a liter. In short, they couldn't get enough to eat. One month's wages was only enough to eat for ten days. Women also worked. They took care of foxes for the "Maozi," and fox fur was used to make women's coat collars. An old Fujian man said, "Children over the age of fifteen have to work, and those under fifteen do housework at home." The overseas Chinese children used to attend Japanese schools in South Sakhalin, but now the "Maozi" don't run schools, and the children don't go to school.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Three Years to Escape the Tiger's Mouth</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese did not have any formal organization there, but in the past, during the Japanese rule, there was a Greater China Chamber of Commerce, headed by Lu Changbang. Another person named Wang Dingxian, who was engaged in well business there, was a leader. All the overseas Chinese gathered together three times a year to eat, drink, and be merry. This time, both of them are representatives of the repatriation group, leading other overseas Chinese back to their country. Speaking of returning to their country, this is really a history of struggle for them. For many years, they wanted to return to China, but under the rule of the powerful rulers, they always failed. This time, they were able to escape the tiger's mouth because the Chinese consul negotiated with the Soviet authorities for three years before they achieved their goal. Finally, except for four or five people, all of them returned. But in North Sakhalin, there are still more than 300 overseas Chinese living in pain, and they don't know when they will be able to return to their embrace!</p>
<p>When asked what they would do after they came back, their answers were mostly a smile, or "We'll see later!" Maybe they are still full of hope. But in fact, they don't know that they are homeless wanderers who have no one to help them—this matter was originally notified by the Soviet side to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was transferred to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Shanghai Office has no money at all, and the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also has no funds. The relief affairs of the General Administration have also ended long ago. As a result, the representative of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office requested the mayor, and fortunately, the mayor agreed to provide a week's supply, but what about after that? At least for now, there is no solution. Not only is there no solution for the future, but there is also no place to live yesterday. "With no relatives and no money, the Gogol" is parked in the center of the Huangpu River. The stevedores' estimate for carrying the luggage of this group of people ashore is about 6 million, who will pay for this? The agent of the "Gogol" shipping company refused to pay. This group of more than 100 poor refugees had already spent seven days on the ship, but last night they could only spend another night on the ship blowing the sea breeze. And if they still have nowhere to go today, they can only sleep on the streets. Because the "Gogol" will sail back to Vladivostok tomorrow, and the Russians want to disinfect the ship first. And all they brought this time, besides a few rags and quilts, was no money at all. Before they returned to their country, the Russians were not allowed to take money out of the country, and they handed over the little money they had left to the Chinese consulate, which will be returned to them by the Chinese government after negotiating with the Soviet side in the future. The person in charge of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office went to investigate yesterday to see if there were any relatives and friends of the overseas Chinese in the country who could be sent away immediately, but there were none. There was an old lady who was the only one to pick up guests, but as a result, none of these people were Jian's relatives. They have been away from home for decades, and there has been no news for a long time. I don't know where to find relatives and friends. There is also a woman on the ship suffering from meningitis. Fortunately, Wen Songling from the External Affairs Office in Shanghai and Zheng Luyi from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office managed to bring her ashore first and send her to the epidemic hospital. As of yesterday afternoon, there was no solution to the food and accommodation for the other 160 people today, tomorrow, or in the future. It depends on the enthusiasm of these few people to run around and try to find a way overnight.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Allocation Time Pressing General Trade Union Requests Extension</h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" Workers in the coal and firewood industry, the white iron industry, and the woodworking industry have been requesting the General Trade Union to find a solution because the time limit for the allocation of coal briquettes to workers stipulated by the People's Food Allocation Committee is too pressing, and all the stipulated procedures cannot be completed in time. After receiving the request, the General Trade Union decided to continue to request the People's Food Allocation Committee to do six points: The factory should be fully responsible for compensating the difference if the factory has not applied or cannot apply, resulting in the loss of allocated goods. Temporarily postpone the purchase of allocated items with the national identity card or its receipt. Please do not deliberately make things difficult when applying for allocation.

<h3>Hong Kong "Dregs" Politicians Show Their True Colors as Doctors Accusing Prostitutes and Good Women of Being Equal</h3>
<p>"A report from our Hong Kong correspondent on the 20th" After the China Democratic League (CDL) announced its dissolution in the mainland, its "CDL Southern Headquarters" in Hong Kong became even more active. Peng Zemin, the person in charge of the CDL Southern Headquarters, hung up a sign that read "National Doctor Peng Zemin" in a small building on Belcher's Street, a quiet corner of Hong Kong, and his talent became known to the world. He is 71 years old this year, which shows that he is already very old. The location of the CDL Southern Headquarters is actually Qingshan, Kowloon. In a large villa there (belonging to Cai Tingkai's property), they added a "Dada College" to step up the training of new cadres. The president is Chen Qiyuan. The main speakers include Deng Chumin, Qian Jiaju, Chen Shisheng, Huang Yaomian, and others.</p>
<p>Using Cai Tingkai's Property</p>
<p>Before the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Chen and Peng were both executive committee members of the Second Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. However, among the opposition figures who live in Hong Kong, Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai are the most noteworthy. Li and Cai are still in Hong Kong. Li recently met with a reporter from a certain Hong Kong newspaper (namely, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily) to talk about modern Chinese history. He said that his current life in Hong Kong is maintained by the monthly rent of 80 million yuan from a house he owns in Nanjing. He is very interested in going to the United States. It is said that his application for one million US dollars in foreign exchange has not yet been approved by the Standing Committee. He has a son and a daughter in the United States. He lives in Robinson Road, a wealthy residential area in Hong Kong. The house is self-owned and quite spacious. Cai Tingkai has a lot of property in Hong Kong and can be called "second to none" among the opposition figures.</p>
<p>Enjoying Donations While Sitting</p>
<p>There are Cai's houses in Shan Cun Road, Robinson Road, Fung Fai Terrace, Morrison Hill Road, and Kowloon Tong. It is said that there are more than 50 new Western-style houses. He is still eating the donations from the people of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. It is said that he is very busy every day. He, Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Chen Shuren (son of Chen Weizhou, nephew of Chen Jitang), and others have formed a "Democratic Promotion Association." Whether it is the CDL Southern Headquarters or the "Democratic Promotion Association," their "organ newspaper" in Hong Kong is the Wah Kiu Yat Po, which shouts against the government every day.</p>
<p>Scaring the Nurse Misses</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that the Hong Kong police arrested good women, treating them as "streetwalkers." This incident has caused a stir throughout the island. At about 8:45 p.m. on the 16th, three young ladies ran out of the cafe of the Hong Kong Hotel, a gathering place for upper-class figures in Hong Kong, and were stopped by a policeman, who insisted that they were streetwalkers and wanted to take them back to the police station. In fact, they were all nurse misses. Although they explained their identities, the police did not understand and did not allow them to "make a phone call to find someone to guarantee." Later, someone helped them call the doctor at the clinic where they worked. The doctor drove them to the police station in person before they were released. After this incident, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily said, "Streetwalkers have now become a special name in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong police can arrest women on the street by virtue of this special name... We really think that the Hong Kong police have violated the British Constitution's 'right to protect the freedom of the human body'!" The New Life Evening Post advocated severely punishing the policeman who caused the "extremely serious problem." The English South China Morning Post believes that the word "loitering" is difficult to have an appropriate scope, and also advised the police to respect human rights. In the future, if they want to arrest "streetwalkers," they should only do so after "sufficient warning."</p>
<p>The Unfortunate Ones Give Up the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The three unfortunate ones, Tan Wei, Hai Shiyun, and Cen Ruiqing, wrote a letter to the Hong Kong and Macao Women's Movement after the incident, saying, "This kind of indiscriminate arrest of good women not only tarnishes the reputation of all female compatriots in Hong Kong, but also makes everyone feel insecure in their actions, making the entire women's community in Hong Kong like a terror atmosphere," but they finally stated that they did not want to expand the incident and had decided not to sue the police. However, the Chinese and Western women's communities wrote to the Governor of Hong Kong, demanding justice and hoping that similar incidents would not happen again in the future.</p>
<p>Groundless Accusation of Streetwalking</p>
<p>According to this case (the case of the three nurse misses being detained), the same incident happened one night in the past: two ladies, one Zeng Xiyun (her husband used to be a translator for the deputy superintendent of the Hong Kong police), and one Mo Ying (her husband is a foreign paper merchant), were also arrested by the police on groundless accusations of "streetwalking." Mo Ying even spent a cold winter night in the police station. These facts show that the Hong Kong police seem to be overexcited in their public service and have not yet respected the freedom of citizens' bodies! The reporter has previously reported the news that the Hong Kong government has deported two "streetwalkers" for the first time in a century. Whether it is appropriate for the Hong Kong government to deal with prostitutes with such severe means is another matter, but as long as married women and misses with legitimate occupations go out at night, the police arrest them indiscriminately, and accuse them of the same crime as prostitutes. Isn't this "horrifying"? Who doesn't have a wife and daughter? No wonder the Hong Kong overseas Chinese are discussing it and causing a stir in the whole city.

<h3>Wuxi Offers Reward of 890 Million to Capture Bandit Leaders; 10 Million Yuan Reward for Each of the Four Bandits, Including Zhang Zhangzhuoru, Captured</h3>

<h3>Bananas and Oranges Struggle Under Maritime Transportation</h3>
<p>"This newspaper's Taipei, 25th airmail dispatch" The production volume of bananas and oranges in Taiwan Province used to rank third among agricultural products. At the peak of exports, there were 3,508,464 baskets of bananas and 298,000 boxes of oranges. If converted to current prices, bananas would be worth 7 billion 合幣(currency) and oranges would be worth about 1.2 billion 合幣.</p>
<p>In the past, the quantity transported to Japan accounted for 85% of the total, while Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Fuzhou, and other places in mainland China accounted for only 15%. Currently, the output of oranges in Taipei, Hsinchu, and Taichung is almost the same as before the restoration. The increased production of bananas in Kaohsiung and Taichung will soon reach the highest figures of previous years. But what about the sales channels? Japan is no longer included. 100% can be transported to mainland China, but due to the restrictions of maritime transportation, the bananas and oranges of this province are suffering a suffocating fate.</p>
<p>In the past, the freight for each basket of bananas from Keelung to Yokohama, Japan, was 1.3 yuan, 9 角 to Moji, and 7.8 角 to Shanghai. Based on the price of bananas at 11 to 14.5 yuan per basket at that time, the freight accounted for only 10% to 15% of the selling price. Now, it costs 1,100 yuan to transport a basket of bananas from Keelung to Shanghai, accounting for more than 50% of the selling price, and 3,000 yuan to Tianjin, accounting for 150% of the selling price. The profits that should be obtained from selling green fruits to other ports are all taken up by freight.</p>
<p>Green fruit merchants in this province are mostly calling for: reducing maritime transportation costs, improving transportation technology, and hoping to value these special products as much as rice, wheat, and flour, because they are indeed a vital force for this province's industry to strive for exports.</p>
<p>"Another dispatch" Li Chuanlong, an entomologist who collected butterfly specimens in Taiwan, has recently finished his collection work and is preparing to return to Shanghai. Mr. Li came to Taiwan on June 1st and went alone to Yushan, Wushe, central and southern Taiwan, and the eastern Huoshao Island, Red Head Island, Penghu and other places. He collected specimens on the desolate Red Head Island for as long as seven weeks. During the war, he traveled all over the southwestern provinces. After the victory, he became a professor of entomology at Xinjiang College and traversed the Tianshan and Pamir Mountains. Over the past twelve years, he has completed the collection of specimens from eighteen provinces across the country. He has collected a total of 800 species of butterflies, and this time he has collected more than 90 species in Taiwan. According to Mr. Li: Fifty years ago, the British entomologist Leech came to China to collect special butterflies, only 594 species. The Japanese began collecting butterflies in Taiwan in the 18th century, a total of 56 species. Currently, he has collected 800 species. Although it is impossible to discover new species in Taiwan, he has already exceeded 36 species. He is very satisfied with the environment for collecting specimens on the island. There were no fierce beasts discovered in the mountains. However, it is necessary to overcome the invasion of malaria and Red Head bug germs. He plans to return to Shanghai and immediately engage in sorting. After completing the collection of the Dongsha and Xisha Islands and western Yunnan, he can respond to the invitation of the Entomological Society of China to hold a public exhibition and complete a monograph on "Butterflies." According to Mr. Li is one of the leading entomologists in China, and his spirit of devoting himself to science and studying hard is admired by the public. (Special correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<h3>Yang'e Creek White Otter Treasure of Valuables</h3>
<p>"This newspaper's Wuyuan, 20th dispatch" Yang'e Creek in Kaiwen Township, north of the county, is surrounded by mountains and water, with shaded trees. It is a scenic and secluded area in the township. Otters are produced in the nearby mountains and forests from time to time. Whenever the cold frost falls lightly, otters begin to appear on the banks of the creek to catch and eat river fish. Otter hunters often check the traces of the otters in the frequent, familiar paths during the cold, frosty, windy mornings and moonlit evenings, and use bamboo bows to set up traps. When the otter passes by, it steps on the trigger and the bow is released, occasionally catching it by its feet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the otter hunter Wang Chen told reporters: A white otter, a rare and precious species among otters, one in a hundred, was recently discovered on the bank of the creek. This otter is extremely mysterious in its movements. In the hazy moonlight, one can only glimpse its color and shadow, and it is impossible to catch it. After waiting for a long time, it does not appear. He said with great cherish.</p>
<p>He also said: Otters belong to a kind of beast. They often hide in the mountains and come out at night to eat fish. This county has many mountains and clear rivers, which are good places for otters to live. There are very few otters near the water in the plains without mountains. Otter hunters value their skins, which are searched for by fur merchants from Beijing and Hangzhou every year for a lot of money. The selling price is often ten to a hundred times that of other animal skins, especially white otters, which are even more priceless treasures. (Special correspondent Yu Ningpo)</p>

<p>This newspaper's Zhenjiang, 26th dispatch" On the afternoon of the 25th, a similar桃色(scandalous) hanging suicide case occurred at the Second Branch of the Provincial Police Bureau. The reason is that a girl Tian from Jiangdu (26 years old, residing at No. 133 Jianzi Lane) came to Zhenjiang three years ago to avoid the chaos and lived in the home of her aunt and uncle Huang Jiliang (i.e., No. 133 Jianzi Lane).

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Plans Economic Afforestation</h3>
<p>"This newspaper's Taipei, 23rd airmail dispatch" Because Taiwan has high mountains above 3,000 meters, it has a strong 30% forest resource. In the past, the Japanese actively implemented construction, and the demand for materials was urgent. Every year, it still needed to import one hundred tens of thousands of stones. Later, it opened up broad-leaved forests and increased production by 500,000 stones, but it still needed to import millions of stones. Until the end of the war, in order to supply military needs, the annual felling reached two million right, an area of about 20,000 hectares, and the material could not. It has reached, and now it fells more than 11,000 hectares a year, which is more than the area of afforestation.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate felling of forests makes people painfully feel that in five or ten years, more than 70% of the mountains and forests in this province will become barren mountains, and even more directly damage farmland. Recently, Luodong in eastern Taiwan suffered continuous rain for 20 days, and the water source rose sharply. Because the slope was at 401, it was impossible to quickly discharge the water, so the dike collapsed and flooded, and the houses were in ruins. Some say that this is the result of indiscriminate deforestation, but the rise and silting of the riverbed are also the main reasons.</p>
<p>Xu Qingzhong, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, plans to focus on timber wood, camphor forests, fuelwood forests, and tropical special tree species, and compile a large economic afforestation plan to afforest more than 123,000 hectares of mountainous land in five years, requiring 46 million seedlings. He said that at present, afforestation is not only a financial and technical problem, but also a problem of ideology. He is now drafting a plan to reward the whole province's 300, theives stealing, two sides.</p>
<p>Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau thinks that Taiwan's congenital conditions are not enough, so there are artificial hydroelectric agricultural irrigation projects. As far as dikes are concerned, there are 470,000 meters in the whole province, and 40,000 meters need to be repaired urgently. Last year, the Public Works Bureau repaired 17,000 meters, and 19,000 meters were destroyed in June. This year, it is requested to repair 20,000 meters, but because the provincial car has no money, only 8,000 meters can be repaired. If it cannot be sorted out year by year, the fate of the 9 million mu of fields on which it depends for planting will be very pessimistic.</p>
<p>Taiwan's forests, dikes, rivers, and irrigation are closely related to the development of the industry. After inspecting Taiwan, Weng Wenhao told reporters that it is a terrible phenomenon to cut down forests for charcoal and change the right to banana plantations. This forest resource does need our preciousness and maintenance.</p>

<p>"Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th dispatch" This morning, Chinese and Soviet representatives in the Allied Council for Japan strongly criticized Japanese school textbooks, saying that they contained many distortions of facts and the poison of military education. The Chinese and Soviet representatives responded to the statement made by the British representative Mr. Xiao at the last meeting. Mr. Xiao said that Japanese history textbooks are still imperfect, and some paragraphs have secret purposes, and others can unfortunately remind people of Japanese propaganda before and during the war. General Shang first mentioned the basic reform of the Japanese education system, and in view of the deep-rooted 武主义 (militarism) and extreme nationalism in the Japanese education system, he urged the headquarters to provide reasonable guidance and strict supervision, and the committee should also provide constructive suggestions. Mr. Shang suggested that bad teachers should be expelled from the education sector and should not be allowed to hold other public positions. He also cited several places from the history book entitled "Progress of the Country" as evidence. He said that the famous Twenty-One Demands were not mentioned, and the textbook's record of the Manchurian Incident and the Lugouqiao Incident was vaguely referred to as the Chinese incident. After Mr. Shang finished his speech, the Soviet representative Kesslenco stood up in support. Mr. Kesslenco continued to point out some examples of distorted propaganda from the same book. When describing the Russo-Japanese War, it said that Russia 作 (created/manufactured), thus the Korean War occurred. Mr. Kesslenco said that various textbooks made young children think that the annexation of the northeastern provinces of China was purely accidental and not the result of aggression. The book also said that the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack in an attempt to destroy the railways in the Northeast. The new textbooks only whitewash the faults and do not eliminate the distortions of facts. General Shang Zhen also suggested canceling the memorial monuments that marked military exploits and strictly controlling the bad activities of young people.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Official States: Black Market Exchange Rate is Abnormal. Newly Set Exchange Rate is Quite Beneficial to Exporters.</h3>
<p>"Our News" An official from the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee told reporters yesterday: Since the recent exchange rate adjustment, the situation of export exchange settlement has been quite good. In general, exporters believe that the current market exchange rate set by the Committee is in line with reality. It has been able to take into account the costs of exporters. The black market exchange rate has lost its normality and is no longer reliable. If we measure the intrinsic purchasing power of our country's currency with the currencies of various countries, we can know the rationality of the current exchange rate set by the Stabilization Committee.</p>
<p>"Another Dispatch" Recent rumors have been spreading that the government will change its foreign exchange policy and abolish the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Yesterday, reporters specially inquired with Chen Guangfu and Shen Xirui, the chairmen of the Committee. They said that the government has not considered this, and everything is just a rumor. Regarding the fluctuations of the black market foreign exchange, Chen said that it is "not reliable" because the market exchange rate has little connection with the black market. Shen also said that exporters have benefited a lot from the recent market price adjustment, and generally, export goods can be exported, and the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese has also increased. However, they disagreed with the suggestion that the market exchange rate should be raised to exceed the black market to suppress the black market. They believed that this method would mean competing with the black market.</p>
<h3>Seeking to Suppress the Rising Trend of Cotton Cloth: The Textile Control Committee Decides to Allocate Cotton Yarn. The National Bank Agrees to Allocate 30,000 Bales of Foreign Cotton Without Permits.</h3>
<p>"Our News" According to the Textile Control Committee: The recent sharp rise in yarn prices is mainly due to the high price of raw cotton, which has increased costs. To suppress the market price of cotton yarn and cloth, the Committee has obtained the approval of General Manager Zhang of the National Bank to allocate 30,000 bales of foreign cotton without permits to the Textile Control Committee for distribution to various yarn mills to spin cotton yarn on their behalf. This will prevent the mills from competing to purchase cotton on the market and raising cotton prices, thereby achieving the effect of suppressing the market price of yarn and cloth. Any yarn mills that have previously contracted with the Committee for processing, have a good reputation, and are indeed short of cotton, can apply to the Committee for cotton allocation. The allocation method is still under discussion.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to soar. Purchases from Tianjin and Guangdong continued to be smooth, and outside procurement was strong. Prices rose relentlessly, with new highs emerging one after another. Near the close of the market, due to the recovery of outside materials, market sentiment turned stable, and many people sold at high prices, causing the market to fall slightly. However, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to rise by 1.8 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 53.8 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 200,000 to 1.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Firm</p>

However, around 11:00 AM, because the opening price of cloth from the Textile Construction Company increased significantly, market sentiment suddenly became firm. The sale of cloth increased in local stores, and bullish sentiment was strong in the market, driving prices higher and higher. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped over the price limit by 1.372 million yuan. However, the asking price outside the market reached 1.4 million yuan, and many transactions were made at 1.395 million yuan. 190 Shilin cloth was in short supply, soaring by 50,000 to 150,000 yuan.

It was also rumored that Zhenhe Tea Firm and Anhui Tea Company each plan to collect goods for delivery to buyers. However, whether the negotiations will be successful is still difficult to predict.

<h3>Local Banks' Surplus Funds Must Not Circumvent Regulations</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper News" According to the provisions of the financial business control measures in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the surplus funds of local banks in various provinces and cities should be deposited in the local central bank or national bank. It is learned that local banks in various provinces and cities often fail to comply with these regulations and engage in profit-seeking activities under the guise of remittance. The Ministry of Finance specifically reiterates that local banks in provinces and cities must strictly comply with regulations regarding loans to other financial institutions. If there is a confirmed agreement with commercial banks or firms for remittance services, the signed remittance agreement should be submitted to the ministry for approval before implementation. The standard for depositing funds is to meet the actual needs of remittance. If the transactions do not involve remittance, or if large sums of money are left idle for a long period, once discovered, the remittance agreement should be revoked, and the act should be severely punished as an attempt to evade regulations to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose steadily due to overseas stimulus, opening lower but then climbing higher.

At 3 PM this afternoon, Chairman Yuan will continue to meet with members of various private factories, it is said.</p>
<p>"Another News" The heads of the nine associations in the replication industry discussed a common attitude toward the joint distribution of cotton yarn at the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association at 2 PM yesterday. The meeting lasted until 5:30 PM and decided to produce a memorandum with two main points and three sub-points: (1) Regarding the yarn allocation mechanism, a unified organization is recommended. It is advisable to unify the organization and not have the six district associations, the Silk Adjustment Committee, and the Textile Construction Company each establish their own institutions. (2) Request permission for representatives of the replication industry to participate in the yarn allocation mechanism to provide opinions and assist in adjusting supply and demand. (3) Regarding the yarn supply for yarn factories with self-provided looms and pure weaving factories, the replication industry advocates that yarn factories with self-provided looms should also be allocated yarn by the allocation mechanism proportionally, and should not have priority in obtaining yarn, to ensure fairness. The above memorandum will be delivered to the Silk Adjustment Committee today.</p>
<h3>Special Approval for Silk Export in Exchange for Artificial Silk Already Approved by the National Economic Council</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council Has Already Approved [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The government's special approval for silk exports in exchange for artificial silk to subsidize production costs with import surpluses has been approved by the regular meeting of the National Economic Council on the afternoon of the 27th. The measures consist of six points: Increased production and improvement of silk, and continued implementation of the silk production and marketing plan. Use the foreign exchange earned from production and export to purchase artificial silk for distribution to various silk factories. The purchase and distribution of artificial silk will be supervised by the Import and Export Management Committee and handled jointly with the China Import and Export Board. Use the surplus from artificial silk to subsidize production costs. In addition to subsidizing production costs, when there is a surplus, allocate as much as possible to improve and reward silk production. A portion of the allocated artificial silk should be designated for overseas silk sales, exporting to earn foreign exchange. Detailed implementation measures will be formulated by the three ministries of Agriculture, Economy, and Finance.</p>

<h3>"Medical Disputes" - Past and Present Excerpts from the Author's Speech at the Medical Association</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>Chairman, distinguished officials, honored guests, esteemed seniors,</p>
<p>In the past year, the number of medical disputes has broken all previous records. From January 1st to today (November 16th), in less than a year, there have been more than 30 medical lawsuits in Zhejiang and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. The number of cases that were resolved through mediation without going to court is several times higher than this. In Shanghai alone, in the first ten days of November (1st to 12th), there have been three formal medical disputes, averaging one every four days. The two deputy general managers, Qu Jiang, and I, have been serving this association and have spent dozens of hours on this matter alone in these twelve days. If this continues, not only will the association's staff be exhausted, but all members will feel a sense of panic and trepidation. If this trend does not stop, no one will dare to perform surgery or handle difficult childbirths, and even important injections will be difficult to administer. This will directly affect the development of members' careers, and indirectly endanger patients' lives and social stability. A century from now, it will deter young people from studying medicine, leading to a decline in the overall health of the nation. Having recognized this, I feel compelled to speak out. I will present a concise analysis and statistics of the dispute materials I have collected in Beijing and Hangzhou over the past two months, so that judicial authorities and the public can understand the origins of the disputes and make informed judgments. Members of our association can also understand their own weaknesses and be vigilant. Finally, I will attach a plan to eliminate medical disputes for the assembly to discuss. I am not well-versed in these matters, and my words may not carry much weight, but I hope that all seniors will offer guidance on this vital issue!</p>
<p>Analysis and Statistics of Cases:</p>
<p>(I) Classification by Department:</p>
<p>14 cases of disputes arising from internal medicine or injections, accounting for 47%</p>
<p>9 cases of disputes arising from surgery or anesthesia, accounting for 30%</p>
<p>5 cases of disputes arising from difficult childbirth, accounting for 16.4%</p>
<p>1 case of dispute arising from electrotherapy, accounting for 3.3%</p>
<p>1 case of dispute arising from otolaryngology, accounting for 3.3%</p>
<p>(II) Age Classification of the Deceased: 15 adult males, accounting for 50%; 9 adult females, accounting for 30%; 6 minors and children, accounting for 20%.</p>
<p>(III) Family Status Classification: Wealthy, accounting for 5%; upper-middle class, accounting for 10%; middle class, accounting for 25%; impoverished, accounting for 60%.</p>
<p>(IV) Family Occupation Classification: Difficult to collect materials, not disclosed for the time being!</p>
<p>(V) Classification of Case Development:</p>
<p>19 cases dismissed without prosecution, accounting for 62.8%</p>
<p>6 cases prosecuted but acquitted, accounting for 20.2%</p>
<p>1 case sentenced guilty in the first instance but acquitted on appeal, accounting for 3.4%</p>
<p>1 case sentenced guilty in the first instance and currently on appeal, accounting for 3.2%</p>
<p>3 cases under trial with unknown results, accounting for 10.2%</p>
<p>(VI) Classification of Reasons for Prosecution: 8 cases of negligent homicide; 1 case of desecration of a corpse; 1 case of death due to delayed treatment; 1 case of negligent homicide by an assistant.</p>
<p>Exploration of the Causes of Disputes: A. From the Patient's Family:</p>
<p>1. Emotional factors of the patient's family members.</p>
<p>2. The natural trend of social and economic collapse.</p>
<p>3. The consequences of the negative impression of a small number of hospitals and doctors on the outside world.</p>
<p>B. From the Doctor:</p>
<p>1. The doctor's lack of understanding of the national situation (e.g., requesting an autopsy from the deceased's family, leading to a dispute).</p>
<p>2. The doctor's lack of legal knowledge (assuming that the doctor is not responsible because the patient or family has signed a consent form).</p>
<p>3. Insufficient kindness towards the patient's family before the incident.</p>
<p>4. Lack of understanding of the patient's family's psychology (extreme sympathy should be shown to the family after the patient's death).</p>
<p>5. A very small number of colleagues charge too high fees and require prepayment, creating a bad impression of taking advantage of others' distress.</p>
<p>C. From Third Parties:</p>
<p>1. The cumbersome nature of hospital procedures.</p>
<p>2. The poor attitude of a small number of office staff.</p>
<p>3. Excessive insistence on prepayment of fees before admission or surgery.</p>
<p>4. Malicious instigation by colleagues or similar professionals.</p>
<p>5. Encouragement from well-meaning neighbors and relatives of the patient.</p>
<p>The Current Handling of Medical Disputes by the Legal and Media Sectors:</p>
<p>1. The prosecutor's and judge's free evidence collection system does not require complete acceptance of the forensic doctor's opinion. In addition to forensic doctors, the court does not have a provision for hiring other experts as "expert witnesses."</p>
<p>2. Signing a surgical consent form does not exempt liability for gross negligence under Article 222 of the Civil Code for dangerous diseases, except for minor negligence. Therefore, the patient's or family's signature only constitutes an agreement to the risks of the surgery.</p>
<p>3. News reporters often publish articles such as "incompetent doctor kills" out of sympathy for the unfortunate experiences of the deceased's family, causing a negative impression of the medical community among the general public. Once these people encounter similar unfortunate events themselves, they can cite previous examples and unhesitatingly take the medical community to court.</p>
<p>Possible Consequences of Medical Disputes:</p>
<p>(I) Because of the possibility of criminal liability at any time, doctors may develop to "see danger and not dare to save" (only seek to enter the yamen (government), not seek to enter the temple (hospital)). For example, those who could have injected will use oral medications instead, or surgeons may be afraid to operate on cases where there is still a glimmer of hope to avoid responsibility and let the patient develop!</p>
<p>(II) Because of the possibility of being declared bankrupt at any time (e.g., the case of civil compensation of 75 million yuan), doctors with some wealth may give up medicine and enter politics or business. The already insufficient number of doctors will decrease further.</p>
<p>(III) Young students go from elementary school to middle school, from preparatory courses to specialized schools, studying hard for many years. Before obtaining their medical qualifications, 60-70% are eliminated due to physical fitness, intelligence, or economic reasons! Those who are fortunate enough to obtain a medical degree receive very little compensation (before the war, a resident doctor's monthly salary was 100 yuan, which was quite comfortable, but now their monthly income is only several hundred thousand yuan, barely enough to make ends meet!). Their lives are also very monotonous (working day and night, spending all day with distressed patients)! In addition to the heavy responsibility, although they are constantly cautious, walking on thin ice, unwarranted charges can still be imposed on them at any time due to misunderstandings by the patient's family. Once the news of an incompetent doctor killing someone is published, decades of reputation and effort are wasted. Even if they are acquitted later, their reputation is ruined and it is difficult to turn the tide! In this situation, doctors' children will not study medicine. In fact, why would children who are not from medical families spend several years and nearly a hundred million yuan to study medicine and throw themselves into a trap? The highest authority's plan to train 100,000 doctors in five years, as stated in China's destiny, will inevitably suffer the greatest blow as a result, and the nation's health, future, and various nation-building plans will inevitably be significantly affected. This is what I cannot bear to tell the community.</p>
<p>Medical Disputes in England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>Although I enjoy studying law, I only have a superficial understanding. Before writing this section on the laws of various countries, I consulted Dean Peng of the Law School of Aurora University for three hours and visited many judges, prosecutors, forensic doctors, and legal experts. Therefore, what is written in this section is a synthesis of the instructions of various experts. If there are any omissions, I hope that the experts will correct them. I would also like to thank Dean Peng and all the experts here!</p>
<p>(I) England Adopts a System of Expert Jurors: Medical disputes are rare in England. If one occurs, the court generally invites experts from local medical colleges and medical associations to participate in the jury. When making a judgment, the experts vote to determine guilt or innocence, and then the judge pronounces the sentence.</p>
<p>(II) The United States Has an Accidental Insurance System: Parts that are sued mostly ask for civil compensation. Few file a doctor's criminal number toward the insurance company holding "Business Accidental" insurance. (The method is the same as car accidental insurance.) If an accidental dispute occurs, the insurance company is responsible for legal litigation and compensation!</p>
<p>(III) The System of Expert Identification in France and the Soviet Union: Generally, when local courts encounter medical disputes, the presiding judge and prosecutor appoint one or more experts from the local experts as "expert witnesses" to review whether the doctor is at fault. The result of their identification can sway the judge's judgment. The expert must also make a pledge before the identification, stating that "a fair and honest identification must be made" to show fairness!</p>
<p>How to Eliminate Disputes Permanently?</p>
<p>(A) What Each Member is Expected to Do:</p>
<p>(1) Value the sacred mission of the profession and not change careers or have a "see danger and not save" mentality due to one or two disputes.</p>
<p>(2) The attitude towards patients should be absolutely kind.</p>
<p>(3) Do not charge too high fees, and reduce or waive fees for the poor and sick.</p>
<p>(4) Study legal knowledge related to the medical community.</p>
<p>(5) Understand the patient's psychology and understand the national situation.</p>
<p>(6) Continuously improve their knowledge through further study.</p>
<p>(7) Do not make casual remarks or intentionally or unintentionally slander colleagues.</p>
<p>(8) Members responsible for managing hospitals should strive to change the attitude of medical staff and clerks towards patients.</p>
<p>(B) What this Association is Expected to Do:</p>
<p>(1) Promote medical ethics to members and introduce to the community the truth about the service of this association members to society (the total number of people diagnosed and treated free of charge by all members of this association each year is quite large, but the outside world does not know the truth because there is no comprehensive statistics).</p>
<p>(2) Hold legal lectures to instill legal knowledge in members.</p>
<p>(3) Provide legal relief to members.</p>
<p>(4) Create a "mock court" to study whether members are at fault. Those who are guilty will not be defended, and those who are innocent will be supported.</p>
<p>(5) Join forces with medical associations across the country to request the legislative authorities to amend the Doctors Law and petition the judicial authorities to request improvements to the medical dispute trial procedures and compensation for unjust imprisonments.</p>
<p>(C) What is Hoped for from the Public:</p>
<p>(1) It is hoped that the media will not casually publish articles with titles that harm the reputation of doctors, such as "incompetent doctor kills," before a dispute has been adjudicated.</p>
<p>(2) It is hoped that colleagues in the legal community will sympathize with the medical community and provide guidance when parties make unreasonable demands!</p>
<p>(3) It is hoped that the insurance industry will offer "professional accident insurance" to protect doctors' civil liability.</p>
<p>(4) It is hoped that the patient community will sympathize with the difficult and sacred mission of doctors and not, as the fabulists say, "regard doctors as angels when treating diseases, regard doctors as devils when paying bills, and regard doctors as creators when patients unfortunately die." This will reduce many unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>(D) What is Hoped for from the Legislative, Judicial, and Administrative Authorities:</p>
<p>(1) It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will increase the budget for national medical education and improve the equipment and training of teachers in medical colleges, medical, pharmaceutical, obstetrics, nursing, and other specialized schools. To achieve the five-year plan for the highest authorities to create medical personnel, medical schools should be established in the mainland to improve the quality of doctors while simultaneously improving their quality, and to achieve the "public medical system" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) It is hoped for at the Ministry of Health:</p>
<p>A. To protect people's lives, special care should be taken in issuing doctor's licenses. However, once issued, the doctor's business should be adequately protected, and the revocation of a doctor's license should be very careful.</p>
<p>B. A short-term training of medical personnel who barely pass the screening or are not far below the passing score should be added, and they should be assigned to public hospitals and clinics for practical experience at the time. After the results are permitted, they are assigned to the areas in urgent need of doctors but without doctors, and work for a considerable period of time. Then they are given a license to allow them to practice freely, in order to show the best of both worlds!</p>
<p>C. The public medical system should be promoted in districts year by year, so that the poor and sick have treatment, and the society's condemnation of doctors can be reduced (because doctors have to maintain their own and their family's lives, they cannot provide completely free service to patients).</p>
<p>D. Some laws and regulations should be amended: "Example 1" Midwives are not allowed to deliver babies alone before graduating, but the regulations of the Ministry of Education stipulate that midwives should have had at least several times of delivering babies alone before graduation in order to graduate.</p>
<p>"Example 2" Those without a doctor's license are not allowed to perform intravenous injections. This is a good intention, but most of the resident doctors in major hospitals are sixth-year students of various medical colleges and do not have a license. If they are not allowed to inject, they will never have the opportunity to learn. If they are allowed to inject, and unfortunately a dispute arises, their professors will take the blame for them. Therefore, in order to seek the soundness of medical education, a win-win strategy should be sought.</p>
<p>(3) It is hoped for the Legislative and Judicial Authorities:</p>
<p>1. Traditional Chinese medicine and new medicine have different systems and methods. It is inappropriate to try to regulate them with the same Doctor Law. As for how the Doctor Law should be amended, a special committee of this association is discussing it and will submit another article for discussion.</p>
<p>2. Medical dispute cases should preferably adopt the UK's "expert juror system." At the very least, all courts in the country should be ordered to respect the opinions of forensic doctors. In addition, they should follow the example of France and invite experts such as doctors, medical associations, and medical associations from local medical colleges as "expert witnesses." The judgment of the case should respect the opinions of the expert witnesses (it is heard that Article 189 of the Criminal Procedure Law already has a "expert witness system").</p>
<p>3. Compensation for unjust imprisonments system: In recent years, the judicial community has been promoting it. In view of the losses suffered by members of this association in the past, this "compensation for unjust imprisonments" or "counter-accusation" system should be promoted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) It is hoped for the Ministry of Interior or the Information Bureau:</p>
<p>In order to protect the rights and interests of the personnel of this association, it is requested that all newspapers and publications across the country be notified to be careful not to publish titles that harm the reputation of doctors, such as "incompetent doctor kills," before the third trial is adjudicated.</p>
<p>If the above points can be gradually realized through the cooperation of all parties, then medical disputes may be eliminated permanently. We are willing to work together with the members of this association to achieve this goal. If approved by the general meeting, we are willing to make a proposal to the National Federation of Medical Associations in the name of this association, and petition the relevant ministries and departments. With the support of the people, we will succeed in our endeavors. Let us work together.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Flourishing Era of "Nepotism"</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>The Han Dynasty is historically known as a "Prosperous Era," and perhaps the era with the most rampant "nepotism" in history was the late Eastern Han. Although the initiator of this practice was the Empress Dowager Xuan, mother of King Zhao of Qin in the distant Qin Dynasty, it was greatly adopted in the Han Dynasty. The reason was that the empress dowager wanted to monopolize power on behalf of her son, the emperor, and feared that employing others would be detrimental to her. Therefore, she appointed her own father and brothers to important positions, creating a situation where the maternal relatives held power.</p>
<p>According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," "When King Zhao ascended the throne, he was young, and the Empress Dowager Xuan personally managed affairs. She appointed her half-brother Wei Ran as general, entrusted him with governance, and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Rang." This was indeed the beginning of empress dowagers' regency in history, and also the beginning of heavy reliance on "nepotism."</p>
<p>In the Han Dynasty, after Emperor Gaozu passed away, Empress Lü came to power. She vigorously cultivated the power of "nepotism," enfeoffing the descendants of the Lü family, such as Lü Zhao, Lü Chan, Lü Lu, and Lü Tong, as kings, breaking the limitation established by her husband: "Anyone who is not of the Liu clan and becomes king shall be executed by all under Heaven." It was not until after Empress Lü's death that the Liu clan raised their heads again. Zhu Linghou Liu Zhang and his clansman Jianghou Bo and others formed a united front, "capturing and executing all the men and women of the Lü clan, regardless of age." They completely eradicated the "nepotistic" power of the Lü family.</p>
<p>Thereafter, those who sought enfeeoffment through "nepotism" were still not lacking in every generation. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Dou Ying and Tian Fen, who fought each other for favor and ultimately led to each other's deaths, both belonged to the "nepotistic" faction. And the three great generals of the same era, Wei Qing, Huo Qubing, and Li Guangli, who achieved brilliant accomplishments and were successively in great power, also rose to prominence through "nepotism" due to their relationships as brother-in-law and nephew, eventually achieving great success and soaring to high positions. Huo Qubing's younger brother, General Guang, obeyed Emperor Wu's deathbed command, assisted Emperor Zhao, emulated the story of the Duke of Zhou, and acted as the actual emperor. After Emperor Zhao died, he welcomed and enthroned King He of Changyi, but soon deposed him. Then, he welcomed and enthroned Emperor Xuan, and also arranged for his daughter to enter the palace as empress. His power became even greater! Even Emperor Xuan had to fear him. As history says, "When the Emperor first ascended the throne, General Guang rode in the same chariot. The Emperor was deeply afraid of him, as if he had thorns in his back." After Guang died, his sons eventually suffered the great misfortune of clan extermination.</p>
<p>By the time of Emperor Yuan, the "nepotistic" descendants of Empress Wang's lineage gradually became prominent. In the subsequent reigns of Emperors Cheng and Ai, the world became dominated by the Wang family. By the time of Wang Mang, he killed Emperor Ping and openly usurped the throne, transforming the Western Han into the Xin Dynasty. Although that time was very short.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Han Dynasty, after Emperor Zhang, empress dowagers held court and maternal relatives were in power, which became commonplace. As recorded in the "Book of the Later Han, Biographies of Empresses and Consorts": "The imperial lineage of the Eastern Capital was repeatedly severed, and power reverted to the women. Four emperors (An, Zhi, Huan, Ling) were established by maternal relatives, and the empress dowagers held court. All of them made decisions behind the curtains and entrusted affairs to their fathers and brothers. They favored young children to prolong their rule and suppressed the wise and virtuous to monopolize their power." This truly reached an era where "nepotism" reached its peak. As a result, the disaster of eunuchs in the late Han Dynasty was brewed. In the end, "the great fortune declined, and the divine chamber perished." For example, Empress Dowager He of Emperor Ling employed her elder brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, who was a useless person. Wanting to eliminate the eunuchs, he was instead killed by them. Summoning Dong Zhuo led to a situation of warlords vying for territory and the establishment of the Three Kingdoms. Looking at the origin of this "nepotism," it can be said to have been around for a long time. Considering the prevalence of this trend today, why should we be surprised?</p>
<h3>### The Problem of Eating</h3>
<p>— Jiang Duansheng</p>
<p>At this time of expensive rice and firewood, when strict frugality is being practiced, salary earners who can't make ends meet must calculate everything. Clothes can be old and worn, housing can be in attics, travel can be on foot, and even "eating" must be frugal. There's really no choice. I remember that the master of practical learning, Mr. Hu Puan, once said before his death: "If you strictly practice frugality and only eat half a bowl of rice per meal, you won't feel bitter for long!" He was truly a man of determination. Living in today's world, flipping through ancient books, there are records about eating that evoke longing and make one's mouth water:</p>
<p>"The 'Records of the Grand Historian' says that Lian Po met the envoy of Zhao and ate a dou of millet and ten catties of meat to the full. The envoy returned and said that General Xiaokang still liked rice. How true it is that he was good at eating!"</p>
<p>"During the time of Fu Jian of the Qin Dynasty, there was Xia Mo who was the Left Garrison Officer, and Hu Mo who was the Right Garrison Officer. The eunuch Shen Xiangjian was the Fan-Bearer. All three were eighteen feet tall, and they were all strong and good at archery. Every meal, they ate one dan of rice and thirty catties of meat." Compared to Lian Po, they were no less than Chen Shuo compared to dwarfs.</p>
<p>"Wang Wan, the King of Southern Yan, was from Jinan. He was nine feet tall, with a ten-circumference waist. He could ride a horse across the fields without a saddle. Murong De saw his great height and was amazed. He gave him food, and he ate more than one hu. De was surprised and said, 'What he eats is like this. He cannot be satisfied by farming alone. Moreover, his talent and appearance are not mediocre.' He was appointed as the magistrate of Fengling. When he arrived at his post, he governed clearly and achieved great fame, and he was summoned to be the governor of Donglai." If these three were to meet Wang Ying, they would be like a small wizard meeting a great wizard.</p>
<p>"Sun Gong, named Erzun, styled Pingshu, the Governor of Zhejiang and Fujian in the Qing Dynasty, suffered from edema for many years. Recommended by Mr. Bai, Menglu was sent by an official to go to diagnose him. When Menglu arrived, Gong's illness was already incurable. After the diagnosis, he asked how much he had eaten lately. The attendant answered from the side, 'At this time, his stomach qi has changed greatly, and he can only eat seven or eight bowls a day.' Menglu was surprised and said, 'If he eats so much, how can you say that his stomach qi has changed!' The attendant said, 'Sir, you don't know. Compared to what the great man used to eat, it is less than three out of ten!' He then said that when Gong was not ill, he often needed ten pig trotters for a meal, and other things were in similar proportions."</p>
<p>If these people were born in today's world, they would definitely cry out, "Born at the wrong time!"</p>
<h3>### Three Wishes</h3>
<p>— Liu Rong</p>
<p>Feng Yansi, the Chancellor of the Southern Tang Dynasty, has a chapter in Yuefu poetry called "Changming Nu" (Long-Lived Woman):</p>
<p>"Spring day banquet, green wine, a cup, a song, a round. Bowing again, presenting three wishes: First wish, my lord, a thousand years. Second wish, my lady, long-lasting health. Third wish, like swallows on the beam, year after year, forever together."</p>
<p>It depicts the feelings of a virtuous woman, loyal and unwavering, wishing each other well for life, growing old together, year after year, eternally happy, gentle, and affectionate. Its language is rich and graceful. Placing it in the ancient Yuefu collection, it can be without shame.</p>
<p>Also, an ancient poem says: "The day before yesterday, a feast at Zhang's house. Yesterday, a banquet at Wang's house. Today, passing by my humble dwelling, three meetings in three days. Feeling this deep affection, I make three wishes with you: First wish, the world is peaceful. Second wish, long-lasting health. Third wish, in old age, to meet with you often." Reciting this, we see the lofty character of the ancients. Their sincerity and profoundness are unattainable. And the three wishes they express, first, wishing for a peaceful world, is especially realistic in today's world of frequent wars and ongoing conflicts, and can be said to be what the whole country unanimously desires. Second, wishing for long-lasting health, is what everyone aspires to. Third, wishing to meet with you often in old age, in this world where people's hearts are fickle and unreliable, this kind of steadfast friendship that does not fade in old age is especially worthy of emulation. However, living in modern times, should our wishes be limited to the above three?</p>
<h3>### Nocturnal Gnawing Song</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Knocking, tapping; clanging, clattering. Smashing dishes, gnawing through boxes. The top of the tent is a racecourse, the head of the bed is a bullfighting arena? Squeaking, chirping, still shouting, repeatedly scolding, "This place is the worst!" The soy sauce in the spicy sauce jar is moldy; the oil in the vegetable oil pot is also exhausted. Ancient hatreds and present sorrows burn the heart like fire, precious rice and expensive firewood make people feel pitiful. Awakened from a dream, I hear you talking about love; it prevents me from sleeping in the middle of the night. You should think of the weary working people and grieving wives, working thirteen hours during the day! I scratch my graying temples, forcing myself to open my eyes, patting the edge of the bed, furrowing my brows. Alas, gnawing creatures, gnawing creatures, how cruel you are! Spring, summer, autumn, winter, night after night; my family can't afford a cat, so I let you be rampant all night. Do you see the happy dens in the city that never sleeps, where horses are gambled and people laugh heartily? Business is good, connecting north and south, eating some things doesn't matter! Do you see the wealthy merchants hoarding thousands of dan of grain, their wives and children with rosy faces, piles of money that can't be used up, and golden houses built high along the street? In the midst of calls for frugality, they sleep on their wallets, and life becomes even worse than before. The tuition fee is meager and difficult to make a living on, and a piece of clothing costs millions of yuan!</p>
<p>Note: "Nocturnal gnawing creatures" is another name for mice. "Knocking, tapping" refers to the sound of mice gnawing on things. "Clanging, clattering" refers to the sound of things colliding and falling over. "苟 　" means not having a big style. "Sleeping on their wallets" means being afraid of mice gnawing and damaging them, so they have to do that.</p>
<h3>### A Few Words on Winter Relief</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>On a late autumn night, a cool breeze rustles. Under the lamplight, I read "Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing," and when I reach the section about the old man of Danyang, the benevolent words are so moving that I close the book and sigh three times! As it says, "Whenever it rains or snows, he supports himself with a cane and goes to the field temples, asking the beggars about their sufferings and providing them with porridge for relief. He always tidies up dilapidated houses, expands narrow ones, stores grain, and repairs tools. He often gives things away freely and leaves empty-handed. He said to people, 'Having surplus clothing and rice, how can I bear the cold and hunger of others? It is not the intention of Heaven and Earth to give birth to me. How can my compatriots still be strangers to each other?'"</p>
<p>At this time when disaster victims are gathering in Shanghai and winter relief urgently needs to be carried out, providing clothing and porridge, as well as widely establishing shelters from the cold, are urgent measures that cannot be delayed. According to reports, the funding, in addition to the portion allocated by the government, is far from the actual amount needed, and eagerly awaits the enthusiastic donations of charitable organizations and benevolent gentlemen. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Although there have been frequent years of war, inflation, and a sluggish economy, there are still not a few who have surplus clothing and rice. If they can slightly restrain their excessive enjoyment and slightly reduce their extravagant spending, and remember the words of the old man of Danyang, showing more compassion and concern, and thinking more about the stability of the entire country and society and about humanity, they will not be reluctant to donate!</p>
<h3>### West Wind</h3>
<p>— Shuxiang</p>
<p>—One of Leisurely Talks in the Sun—</p>
<p>The west wind has come to the human world again!</p>
<p>Of the four seasons, the west wind is naturally the most annoying! The west wind etches out the joys and sorrows of the rich and poor. The rich wear fur robes and woolen shirts, while the poor wear incomplete coarse clothes. "The west wind of snobbery confounds summer," He Hua's minor expresses the pain completely.</p>
<p>But wind is a natural product. Although science has progressed, there is no way to eliminate wind. The tyrannical Qin Shi Huang crossed the river to the Xiang River Temple and encountered a strong wind that almost prevented him from crossing. He asked the scholar what kind of god Xiangjun was. The scholar replied, "The daughter of Yao and the wife of Shun are buried here." Shi Huang was furious and ordered three thousand convicts to cut down the trees of Xiangshan, using the act of cutting down trees to vent his hatred of the wind. How ridiculous!</p>
<p>Dongpo Zhilin records: "A noble young man was drunk in the snow and leaned against the railing, facing the wind and saying: 'How refreshing!' Those around him heard this and some wept. The young man was surprised and asked the reason. They said: 'My father died because of being 'refreshed'!' This is truly a great contradiction between joy and sorrow. The noble young man naturally had a fox fur coat on his body when he leaned against the railing after getting drunk. A gust of west wind refreshed his mind, so it's no wonder he said 'How refreshing!' But the fathers of those around him died because of being 'refreshed.' There are probably many patrons in Shanghai's big restaurants who stand in front of the windows after getting drunk and full, shouting 'How refreshing!' I don't know how many poor people on the streets have died in the sound of 'refreshing.'"</p>
<p>King Xiang of Chu ascended a platform, and a wind blew swiftly. The king said, "How delightful this wind is! Do I share it with the common people?" Song Yu replied, "This is solely the king's heroic wind; how can the common people share it!" In the howling west wind, may the noble young men of today not forget those who died of being "refreshed" after shouting "How refreshing!"</p>
<h3>### Rule of Law and System</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fang</p>
<p>I remember a foreign professor saying, "Rule of law and rule of propriety are just like eating dishes. Rule of law is like eating Western food, with each person getting a portion, and no one can snatch it. You can eat more or less, all within a certain range. Anything outside the range is 'wrong'! Rule of propriety is like eating Chinese food. If everyone is polite, it's especially good. The dishes in the bowls are untouched, and there's still a lot left when you're done. But if someone is impolite, they'll snatch and argue, and even if the bowl is turned upside down, it won't be enough. If things go wrong, there will even be a fight." This is truly a wonderful metaphor.</p>
<p>In short, as long as things are done well, there's nothing that can't be done. Rule of law can "reward the deserving and punish the guilty," while rule of propriety can "make honesty clear and shame known." The results of both can be that thieves do not arise, lost items are not picked up, and outside doors are not closed.</p>
<h3>### Pity the Parting</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>According to our Chengdu correspondent, a large group of female thieves has been discovered in Fuling. They have committed many crimes, and it has been impossible to investigate. According to those who have glimpsed them in the moonlight, "They are all lithe young women, wearing headbands and tight-sleeved jackets, moving like snakes on rooftops, disappearing in a flash." This is truly like the so-called flying swordsmen in old novels. Does Sichuan Province still have such people?</p>
<p>It is said that Fuling has many female thieves, skilled at scaling walls and moving swiftly, making it difficult to detect. They strangely dress and move like snakes on rooftops in the moonlight!</p>
<p>Could they be modern female swordsmen, changing styles with the trend: They are base and greedy, stealing from here and there, their consciences dark!</p>
<h3>### Various Aspects of Iran</h3>
<p>— Linlin</p>
<p>Iran has a land area larger than the combined areas of Germany, France, and Italy, making it a large country in the world. However, its population is pitifully small, only between eight million and sixteen million.</p>
<p>In theory, Iran is a constitutional monarchy with a National Assembly. However, in reality, it is a country dominated by two thousand wealthy families. These two thousand wealthy families own the land, and they are the cabinet, and they are the National Assembly. They control the finances and the military; and they allocate most of the national revenue to military expenses, with constitutional police funds accounting for about fifty percent. Therefore, Iran's economic situation is unstable. There is serious inflation, a thriving black market, and unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate.</p>
<p>The King of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, is famous for being romantic. He is only twenty-eight years old this year, with a pale complexion and watery eyes. He grew up entirely in the atmosphere of autocratic dominance in the palace. But he is a docile and kind young man, which is in stark contrast to his barbaric old king. He studied in Europe for five years and is familiar with the etiquette of England, France, and various European countries. He ascended the throne in 1943.</p>
<p>Since the days of Darius and Cyrus, Iran's national power has greatly declined. Its scenery of contrasting mountains and deserts is very beautiful. But only a few of the more than ten million people live in luxury and debauchery; the disparity between the rich and the poor is as vast as heaven and earth. No less than seven million people suffer from syphilis, accounting for about half of the total population; most people smoke opium. Four out of every five children die in infancy; three out of four people are illiterate.</p>
<p>To this day, Iran only has two political parties: the Citizen's Party and the Anti-Sad's National Will Movement Party. The Citizen's Party is pro-Soviet and was formed in 1943 with the support of the Soviet Union. Its members are workers, farmers, intellectuals, etc., and it is active in northern Iran. The National Will Party is supported by Muslims, landowners, and conservatives in Iran and is active in southern Iran. Its foreign policy is pro-British and anti-Soviet. And these two parties have never been able to cooperate, leading to frequent party struggles.</p>

<h3>### Miss America and the Bull</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Probably because of the influence of the Spanish, many folk customs and habits in the United States cannot escape the brave and fierce nature of the Spanish. To give an example, the Rodeo, which is popular in the central and southern United States, is completely Western European in style, and the word is not English at all. What is called Rodeo is a grand competition of wild bulls and wild horses. Many mountains and forests in the central and southern United States still breed many wild bulls and wild horses. Although they have been captured, they are still difficult to tame and control. Wild bull and wild horse races are held in certain seasons, and the locations are all in the suburbs, because hundreds of acres of open space are needed. Temporary stands and fences are erected. The riders participating in the performance must first register. They are all from far away, like famous artists from north and south in our country, specifically rushing to a certain place to perform. The riders all have ten years of experience. On the day of the performance, the audience buys tickets to enter. The bulls and horses are all numbered. The riders wear colorful and varied costumes, half-high, patterned leather boots, embroidered silk shirts, and felt hats. They are dressed somewhat like the five headmen in Wu Song killing his sister-in-law. Amidst applause like thunder, they ride out on wild horses or wild bulls with smiles. In less than three seconds, the beast has thrown the rider to the ground. If the rider is not thrown off within a certain number of seconds, then the rider has a chance to win the championship. There are also many young ladies among the riders. Although they are beautiful, they are as strong as bulls. They can capture the horns of wild bulls from horseback, shrug and get down, and tie the wild bulls into a ball with hemp ropes. Their strength makes even great men bow down. With their two jade arms, they can knock an ordinary man more than ten feet away. Therefore, when you make friends with a girlfriend in the United States, you must inquire and be clear. If she is a Rodeo contestant, it is best to hide your clumsiness. Otherwise, if you cannot satisfy her, and she kicks you off the bed, you will definitely be in trouble. Miss America usually wears rescue outfits to school and is mostly a skilled horse rider. It is best to eat less tofu. (Ten) (Seven)</p>

<p>To Mr. Wang Zimin: A marriage contract made by your parents on your behalf when you were a minor can be dissolved according to law if you do not agree to it after reaching adulthood. The non-defaulting party may request compensation from the defaulting party for the damages suffered as a result. The Civil Code stipulates that if one party to a marriage contract "has a serious incurable disease" or "has venereal disease or other serious illness," the other party may dissolve the marriage contract.</p>
<p>To Mr. Xu Zhiping: Article 1 of the Criminal Law stipulates: "The punishment of conduct shall be limited to conduct that is expressly prescribed by law at the time of the conduct." Regarding the inquiry, there are no legal provisions to rely on.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhu Baozhen: It would be very difficult to handle without being able to present supporting documents. Documentary evidence is more powerful than witness testimony. If you have no documents, it is better to adopt other means. It is better to negotiate gently than to demand it forcefully.</p>
<p>To Mr. Wang Liya, Zhangzhu, Yixing: Your two elder sisters should see a doctor and be examined, and take medicine according to the prescription. Do not casually try over-the-counter medicine, so as not to delay the opportunity for treatment. It is difficult to avoid scratching an itch from afar when asking about illness by correspondence. I will not answer the various points you inquired about.</p>
<p>Searching for a Pocket Watch Editor: I lost an old-fashioned gold-cased pocket watch with the description on the right when I took tram number one on Seymour Road at 7:00 am on the fifteenth of this month. Because the watch is a commemorative item, if any benevolent person finds it, please call Tao Jun at 39720 or me at 46423 to discuss it. I am willing to pay a considerable price as a reward. Sincerely yours, Tao Shusen</p>
