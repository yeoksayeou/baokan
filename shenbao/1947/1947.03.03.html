<h3>主席召見蔣夢麟等　政府改組積極進行　民青兩黨代表晉京商談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕主席二日晨九時召見將夢麟，垂詢宋子文辭職後，政院各種事務。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日電〕今日紐約各晨報及午後報紙，均以首頁刋載宋院長子文辭職，蔣主席兼行政院長之新聞，惟因消息適於週末傳來，各辦公室多己放假，不克立即獲悉各方反響。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立　監兩院曁參會擴增名額名單與主席兼長政院之事同時公布後，雷震於二日晨乘京滬車赴滬。聞此乃政府決心提早改組之表現。雷氏將在滬與各黨派進行商討對四機構之後政院　國府改組之次一步驟。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕雷秘書長震昨（二日）晨自京抵滬。此來係為邀請民社·靑年兩黨當局赴京，與蔣主席商商政府進一步改組事宜。雷氏下車後，即分別往訪民社·靑年兩黨，兩黨當局對赴京商洽事，均表贊同。靑年黨即決定由左舜生氏前往，民社黨於當日下午四時開會後，亦決定由張君勸，徐傅霖，蔣勻田，湯住心，馮今白，萬仭千，盧廣聲等諸氏參加。至兩黨留京中常委，亦全體出席商談。雷氏暨民社·靑年兩黨代表，已定今（三日）晚乘車晋京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕宋子文辭職後，翁文灝，蔣夢麟，兪鴻鈞亦提出辭呈。據悉，中樞擬待政府改組後，再行攷慮。行政院副院長人選，以張尋呼聲為最高。聞宋氏提出辭職時，主席曾加挽留，但宋表示願在財政經濟方面外負責任，並願繼續為國努力。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自宋院長辭職後，市塲上謠言甚多，甚至有謂黃金及物價管制政策將放棄者。據某觀察家告記者，宋氏雖辭職，但不致影嚮政策，因緊急措施方案乃以蔣主席各義發表者；同時繼任者乃謹慎保守之人，在此非常時斯內，不致多所更張。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟主席張瀾氏，以私人名義，致函蔣主席。日前由羅隆基氏携京。茲悉，該函並未送呈主席，已於前日由葉篤議携返滬。據葉氏稱，該函正擬提出時適政府促請中共人員撤退，宋院長辭職獲准，情勢己有轉變。該函內容失去時效，故由本人携返。於今（二日）晨會議中提出修改。二三日內，再出本人帶京提交。據悉，該函經修改後，將更具體表明民盟對當前時局之態度。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民盟章伯鈞氏頃否認民盟人員，將撤往香港之傳說。據稱，民盟盟員中，容或可能有人前往香港者，但對民盟在國內之工作，並無影響。民盟之立塲，繼續不變，將仍為實現統一，和平，民主而努力。渠對外傳渠與羅隆蓬等係屬共黨黨員之消息，認係「惡意造謠」。</p>
<h3>中共留滬人員定期赴京返延　名單已交警備司令部</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國共產黨上海辦事處撤退人名單，業於昨日下午四時向淞滬警備司令部提出，計思南路一〇七號周恩來公館十七人，朱葆山路新華日報館十七人，共三十四人。共方在行政院善後救濟總署擔任聯絡工作之職員五人，名單未提出，將另案辦理。各該人員，已同意於五日上午七時乘車赴京，會同該黨駐京聯聯處人員於七日乘美軍軍用飛機返延安。董必武及其夫人何蓮芝，公子董西生（二歲），與董氏隨從劉國安等，則於昨晚十一時，先行搭車赴京。聞董氏行前會有一函致宣鐵吾司令，有所申述。茲將共方提出之撤退人員名單，探錄如次：（一）周公館人員名單，董必武（共方代表），何蓮芝（董氏夫人），董西生（董氏公子），華石甫（政協顧問），潘梓年（新華日報社長），陳家康（秘書），錢之光（處長），劉昂（錢妻），劉恕（秘書），魯　（劉妻），正　（職員），楊少林（庶務），劉國安（薰必武隨從），王文忠（傳達），黃月仙（女傭），吳月鳳（女傭），計錦洲（司機）（二）朱葆山路新華日報人員名單，徐邁進（編輯），朱世綸（編輯），陳昌議（編輯），王斗光（編輯），方瓊（女文書），王福林（總務），蔣建忠（發行），徐征程（發行），葉賢友（發行），孫羣（交通），蔣　（交通），基一錦（交通），余韋（交通），葉培生（傳達），沈阿福（勤務），蔣月琴（女傭），張建成（交通）。</p>
<h3>周恩來要求展緩撤退期</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕京中共聯絡處一日接延安周恩來致蔣主席電，希望延長撤退時日延緩至太月底止。王炳甫二日晨即以此電送國府文官長吳鼎昌，未晤，即將此函留國府，旋訪邵力子，以此意相告。王再訪張羣，未晤。訪張意乃因中共在渝人員計二百餘人，茲因美機僅足供百人乘坐，故特訪張氏請予設法。二日晚，中共發言人梅益告記者，京聯絡處將待滬渝兩地撒離後，始全體返延。又京處廿五人，於二日上午九時乘美機返延。美使館頃通知中共京處稱，美方可派C四七型機三架，於二日至七日間運送中共京處人員。另有大運輸機二架，則負責運送京處人員。</p>

<h3>川康中共人員限期集中撤退</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>讀宋院長的財政經濟報吿</h3>
<p>宋院長子女在立法院的報吿，狠強調指出：目前經濟上財政上的弊病，都由於通貨膨脹，而通貨之所以膨脹，則由於勝利以後，共黨肆意破壞，和平未能恢復，則自然是鐵一般的事實。在這種情勢之下，要使通貨停止膨脹，他並認為一方面該取締投機買賣，一方面要竭力設法恢復收支的平衡，這也是應有的措施。不過投機買賣，並不足以增加通貨膨脹，而實是通貨膨脹的結果。所以真要阻遏這種膨脹的趨勢，除掉消弭叛亂，恢復和平以外，只有平衡收支，才是正當的途徑。</p>
<p>怎樣才能平衡收支呢？照宋氏所說，和經濟緊急措施方案中所定，其項目為（一）整頓稅收，（二）闢新稅源，（三）移轉國營事業，（四）繼續變賣敵偽產業，和剩餘物資，（五）公用事業，自給自足，（六）停付任何非必要或可暫緩使用的費用。</p>
<p>以上各項，除第二項外，即使非為平衡收支，其實也未嘗不應辦理。現在三，五兩項，已在　擬進行之中，四項本係繼續辦理的事業，二項究何所指，似乎過於渺茫。所傳徵收一次財產稅等，實際未必可通，本報業經指陳，西報亦表懷疑。所以目前應當特別注意和努力的，還在一，六兩項。</p>
<p>宋氏興所得稅一項為例，以為認真整頓，以後數月內，可望有八千億元收入。所得稅是主要稅源，認真整頓以後，其收數自然可觀。不過我們以為無論論那種稅收，如果確能認真整頓，其收數必然大有起色。因為現在辦稅務的效率，其實太差。漏稅，逃稅，走私，造假帳等，幾面公開的秘密。而一部分的不肖員司復不免有舞弊，中飽，需素，漁利等情弊。俗語說得好：羊毛出在羊身上，私人的利益愈得，則公家的吃虧，自然愈大了。主席為加速稅收起見，曾經指出，「不必求計算之精密以至曠日持久，而應採迅捷有效之徵收方法。」這話，自然狠對。但在同時，如果不輔以健全的人事，和嚴明的賞罰，則方法過於嚴密，固將曠日持久，而方法運於疏闊便愈易於上下其手，網漏吞舟了。故在整頓稅收這一點上，我們主為同時應從整頓人事與整飭法紀上着力。至於根本要　，則在體諒納稅人的負担能力，減輕過高的稅率，並參照其知識水準和慣習，汏除一切過於苛細的手續。大家知道：商民之所以要走私，要逃稅，要造假帳，要勾結不肖員司，其動機無非要酌減負担，以自求生存，並不是一定甘心犯法。泆順人情，自然令下如流水了。新近曾聽到過這樣一件事：某局派員挨戶分發稅單，呌他們依限填報。因為內容太複雜了，收件人大都無法照填，只得向來員請教。誰知來員也不明白，多方推托，以至引起糾紛。試想：承辦的人尚不明白，怎能呌人依限遵辦？願遵辦的無從措手，稅收怎能湧旺？</p>
<p>至於停付非必要或可暫緩使用的費用，這一點，自然是人同此心的。但要貫澈這個主張，也有兩個先泆條件，必須做到。第一，無論中央或地方，必須由最高主管機關來流　這一件事，而且要用政治的眼光來解決這一件事。倘使完全交付出納或會計機關來決定，恐怕他們　此權力，也不易折衷至當。如令領款機關自行申述理由，那麼，連設公厠，　公共食堂，也自有其正當和必要的理由。現在支出之所以如此龐大，和預算之所以無法　成，就是因為最高主管機關，大家想做好人，不肯審察時宜，秉公准駁的緣故。</p>
<p>第二，必須要從省罷一切不必要和可以暫緩的的事業入手。各機關的費用，大致可分為行政費和事業費兩部分，而行政費即從舉辦事業而來。所以要停付其費用，應先停辦其事業。否則停付了事業費，單發行政費，便要使大家終日坐食，無所事事，這筆行政費，豐非等於白化？設或單發事業費，停付行政費，這筆事業費又將如何支用？以上兩項，非但整筆地停付時，要發生此等現象，便是生吞活剝地減發一部分，也會使這個機關和這件事業，受到絕大的挫折。所以真要節省這些不必要和可以暫緩的費用時，必須大刀闊斧，把這些不必要和可以暫緩的事業先行停罷。</p>
<h3>哀悼鮑威爾先生</h3>
<p>昨據華盛頓電訊傳來的噩耗，中國之友鮑威爾先生上月二十八日突然撒手與世長逝了！尤其他正在大聲疾呼，　請美國人士重視中國盟邦之後，演說甫畢，遽爾瞑目，不論識與不識，凡是中國人民，聽到這位友人逝世的噩耗，沒有不表示深切的悼惜的。</p>
<p>鮑威爾先生自一九一七年，即前來中國，在滬發行密勒氏評論周報，靠他的一枝健筆，為正義而呼號，為中國的自由富強而呼號，凡看過他的作品的人，沒有不深深佩服他對於中國的認識之清楚。唯有像鮑威爾先生這樣，才可以說得上是中國問題的專家。較之那些到中國走馬看花，即信口開河的記者，相　不可以這里計了，鮑威爾先生在中國，先後將及廿五年之久，幾乎他一生最可寶貴的時間，都消度在中國，中國實在可以說是他的第二　國。</p>
<p>我們對於鮑威爾先生永久不能忘懷的就是他為了正義，為了中國，竞遭到日人的嫉視，將其視為第一號反日份子，無時不想將他置於死地。在珍珠港事變之前，鮑威爾先生仍在上海，與惡勢力奮鬥，其所發表的任何文字，都遭到日人的禁止。當時日本的特工，時時刻刻追隨着他，威脅利誘，千方百計，無所不用其極，但是鮑威爾先生好像是中流砥柱，屹然不動。後來南京偽組織居然也下令通緝，他依舊聲色不變。這種正氣磅礴，實在不可多得。但是不久，太平洋戰爭終於爆發了，鮑威爾先生也就被日本憲兵拘禁起來，他曾遭受日本憲兵的非刑毒打，他的兩條腿受傷最重。一直到一九四二年，始遣送回國，在醫院裏診治到現在，而雙腿始終半廢。</p>
<p>去年東京審訊日本戰犯的時候，鮑威爾先生雖以殘廢之身，仍不辭途中勞苦，親自前往東京作證，返國後身體更不如前。但是誰也料不到他突然逝世。噩耗傳來，怎教我們不痛哭喪一良友！</p>
<p>美國的學者名流，研究遠東問題，有時往往只知其一，不知其二，甚且只知以西方社會的眼光，評量東方古國革新的進程，以致常常發表些似是而非的言論，教我們啼笑皆非。但是這一位中國之友，對於遠東局勢以及中國問題，觀察得實在太清楚了，太深刻了，不論他發表任何意見，都不是不明遠東真相以及中國社會動態者所能道。去年十二月間，美國輿論界對於中國問題的意見，紛紜龐雜，光怪陸離，甚至國務院遠東司司長范宣德也曾發表過一次勸吿美國人勿投資中國的談話，當時鮑威爾先生聽了這種謬語，就發動有正義感的美國人士，聯名致函杜魯門總統，作嚴正的表示。我們並非阿私所好，但如鮑威爾先生的仗義執言，的確值得我們永恒的懷念。</p>
<p>要之，鮑威爾先生的一生，好似為中國服務而生的，他給我們以無限的貢獻。我們聽到了他的噩耗之後，決不僅對於一個普通同業謝世所表示的哀悼而可達其誠悃於萬一的。我們默禱鮑威爾先生靈魂平安！我們尤其默祝中國的民主進步，不負鮑威爾先生的期望！</p>

<h3>防範希共黨傾覆政府　英軍應留駐希臘　美向英要求此點並允予經濟援助</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓一日電〕據可靠方面本日談稱：美國曾要求英國繼續留駐希臘，并允許予以經濟援助，俾阻止足以化梅希臘政府之內戰，及阻止爲共黨開近東之門。美國并向英國保證，美國正在立刻考慮擔任大部份在希臘之經濟負擔，蓋英國現已不勝負担矣。美國并保證不久即將實現此項經濟援助。國務副卿艾克遜今晨以照會一件遞交英英駐症狀大使印佛却見爾，照會內容雖未披露，但悉即爲迅速給予軍事援助，并給予不包括軍隊之若干軍事援助一事。所謂若干軍事援助諒係來複檢槍，其他軍事配備，或剩餘軍事物資之類，但美國並無派遣軍隊之意。美國照會係答覆日前英國送交美國之照會，英國照會表示英國由於國內情況之嚴重，實不能在三月卅一日後繼續其對希臘之軍事及經濟援助。按杜魯門總統曾於二月廿七日在白宮舉行秘密會議。四十八小時之後，美國即送出此一照會。據英方人士談稱：彼等對於美國之覆文殊表滿意。彼等并要求在國務卿馬歇爾赴莫斯科出席三月十日之外長會議之前，即宜實施對於希臘之援助。美國若干議員主張，立即採取行動。民主黨眾議員白羅姆并稱：「吾人必須援助此等人民。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：英外部發言人頃談稱：英美兩國刻正在華盛頓討論英國繼續給予希臘以經濟及軍事上支援之問題。據稱：商談問題之一爲繼續供給希臘以外匯，俾能購買軍火。又稱：英軍撤離希臘後，美國不致派遣軍隊至該國云。又據官方息：外相貝文刻正計劃在三個月內將最後一批英軍一萬人自希臘撤退。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典一日電〕消息靈通人士頃談稱：英國在希臘所政策，在過云數星期內，已完全改變，英國軍事顧問以前常主張以中庸之道應付游擊隊者，現已一反往常，均慫恿希臘政府採取嚴厲行動，並正以槍械供給希臘政府軍，同時英國經濟專家亦均勸告希臘政府設法取得美國之經濟援助。英國政策之改變，其主要原因不外三項，即：（一）希臘不能長此在現行經濟困難中掙扎，而不危及基社會組織；（二）英國旣不能改善其本身之經濟之恐慌，自無力協助希臘；（三）英國深恐希臘境內現行內訌繼續不止，將合希臘有墜入東歐集團之處。</p>
<p>希臘問題性質重大</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二日電〕英國就希臘問題提出憊忘錄後所引起之局勢，華盛頓各評論家均認爲性質之重大，甚於一般世界危機。英國之要求，似暗示該國在地中海方面之多種軍事與經濟義務應移交美國。此間觀察家廖爲此乃美國歷史上最嚴重之問題，美國若不在英軍退出希臘時填補此一空缺，而引起美蘇間之危機，勢將孤任蘇聯填補此空缺而危及歐洲與全世界勢力之平衡，兩者必居其一。華盛　頓某報預料英國退出希臘所可發生之反響爲：（一）希臘成立共產黨政府；（二）土耳其接受蘇聯關於共管韃靼海峽之要求；（三）蘇聯勢力遍及阿拉伯人世界。</p>
<h3>英法盟約時簽字　兩國外長將發表演說　比擬參加軍備標準化協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕英外相貝文昨晚在劍橋郡小港發表演說稱，英法兩國將在鄧扣克簽訂同盟條約，此舉足以象徵兩國自一九四〇年之黑暗時代重新抬頭，恢復吾人處理世界政治之地位云　。此外，此間報紙本日對於英法兩國簽訂盟約，咸表竭誠歡迎，此與下院之熱烈歡迎情形相得益彰。</p>
<p>〔路透社比京一日電〕比利時國防部發言人稱：比國防間長特弗魯杜於下週訪敦倫時，將與英當局談及擴大英美·美加·武器配備標準化協定，至於比利時之事，此舉悉由英方發動云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱，比利時政府刻正考慮先與蘇聯締結同盟條約，然後再與英國締結同盟條約，其所循方針，與法蘇盟約及英法盟約相同。比利時政府或即將要求與英國開始談判，但爲避免組織西方集團之嫌疑起見，比國可能先設法與蘇聯締結同盟。</p>
<h3>艾登呼籲　東西覓取諒解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕英前外相艾登昨夜在此間聯合國協會集會中發表演說，略謂，吾人倘欲覓致永久和平，由西方與東方務必互相諒解，戰時流亡倫敦之合盟國政府，均曾決定經過戰爭的試練後，務必產生踏實容忍與諒解之真精神。吾人之地球已經縮小，今日吾人距離舊金山較百年前距離巴稱尤近。吾人如此唇齒相依，幫不得不密切合作，不問情願與否。吾人能否獲得此一齒唇相依之教訓乎？倘若能够，則物質繁榮之標準無極，而人類之幸福亦將達於頂點。若非然者，則來日之戰爭，加以現代武器之恐怖，或將註定人類之命運，吾人員須選擇可也。</p>
<h3>蒙帥假滿返英</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕英陸軍參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥本日午後自瑞士飛抵肯特郡福克斯登城，當即乘坐汽車　返倫敦。據談稱，余此次前往瑞士消度假日，精神甚感愉快，對於今後重要工作當能盡力云。</p>
<h3>普魯士邦終止存在</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕柏林盟管會今日頒布第四十六號法令，宣佈德軍國主義之發源地普魯士邦，在事實上已終止存在。其現屬盟管會管轄之土地，將另等高邦或併入他邦，普魯士邦中央政府及其附屬機關，亦同時廢止。該法由四張代表簽字，於二月廿五日起生效。</p>
<h3>納粹地下組織內幕　圖以細菌殺害人類及牲口，並擬摧殘農作物</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕國際歐洲問題委員會秘書法國科學字鮑萊爾談稱：德境英美當局最近搜捕某一納粹地下組織之份子約八百人之多，該組織在瑞士及阿根廷有資金極多，妄想實現新計劃，對人類文明展開可怖攻勢。彼等擬散佈白喉傷寒細菌，並擬摧殘農作物，以口腔病及足肢病之細菌傳佈於牲口。吾人有一操極流利德語之人，參加該一納粹秘密機構。渠曾告知吾人，謂此種秘密新武器正在製造中，製新以後將爲粉狀物質以之散佈於公共塲所及車輛中。國際歐洲問題研究會，已將長七頁之報告書分送英，法，比，丹，挪，美，蘇諸國之總理及處交部長，揭露下列事實，俾各國予以適當之注意。據云：軸心國海外資金尙未移交盟國或實行清理，阿根廷內，尙有德國公司數百家存在，其中六十家之資金價值達九千尤元，阿根廷政府並無清理此等資金之保證。德國崩潰前納粹資金逃入瑞士者殊不少，今仍握於避居該國之德領袖掌握中。鮑萊爾並謂：今日仍有許多德人取道瑞典逃亡南美，改名易姓，參加納粹秘密組織。最後渠並曰：在下次戰事發生前，有第五縱隊之國必將有破壞公眾健康之改密恐怖活動發見。</p>
<h3>馬卿率領代表團明日啓程赴蘇京　美蘇間懸安謀全面解决</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕國務卿馬歇爾定於四日前往莫斯科，與蘇聯各領袖當面討論各種問題。美代表團一行八十四人，包括專家二直餘人，彼等熟悉下列各項問題：（一）蘇聯軍備租借帳目之解決，總額一百十二億九千八百萬美元。（二）戰時美國讓予蘇聯之船隻九十五艘，美國要求歸還或償價。（三）執行波茨坦協定，摧毀德國受創之各戰艦，包括未造成之航空母艦「齊柏林」號在內，此艦在史特丁港被蘇軍扣留，莫斯科已承認遲遲未予摧毀。（四）義大利沒收艦船之分配。</p>
<p>遠東利益之衝突，似不在討論之列，因代表團中並無遠東問題專家在內。裁軍與原子管制問題，及聯合機構之事，但可能在莫斯科之幕後提及。馬卿　謂渠是否與史達林及莫洛托夫商議德奧和約以外之問題，端視環境而定，並謂朝鮮行政問題不致討論。衡諸以前各次會議之經騐，外交界預料莫斯科會議將歷時三個至八個星期，全視蘇聯之合作程度爲定。</p>
<p>土耳其聞切</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社安加〕土耳其總理貝克昨日向報界談稱：土國政府最近會就不來莫斯科會議，與若干盟國政府交換意見，因其牽涉土耳其之故。總理並稱，土耳其希望與全體阿拉伯國家保持友好關係，土國並希望獲得外國貸款。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦局勢益嚴重　英軍俱樂部被炸　恐怖份子活躍達流血最高潮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：耶路撒冷本日午后發生猛烈爆炸，猶太協會總部附近槍爽砲聲大作，全城發出警報，交通斷絕。在聖地近代史上，安息日發生暴動，此爲第一次。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷一日電〕巴勒斯坦今日似正急急趨向完全軍治。英軍積極搜查武裝恐怖黨人，該黨曾發動攻擊，炸毀耶路撒冷英軍官俱樂部，致有十六人平胸生，十七人受傷。英軍自稱已處於戒嚴地位。政府在耶路撒冷猶太人區實施宵禁，並限制丹拉雅夫等處居民於宵禁時間外出。英軍以鐵甲車及砲車在耶路撒冷名街道巡邏，並有軍隊出城向北而去。九個月來，今日爲巴勒斯坦恐怖時期流血最多之日。恐怖黨炸毀耶路撒冷英軍官俱樂部，並用大砲襲擊那塞亞附近英軍營，死一人，傷二人，又在海法附近駱駝路上埋置地雷，炸毀吉普車一輛，死傷各二人。德爾客附近亦有卡車一輛觸地雷炸毀，傷英軍一人。克洛奧納附近兵營並遭襲擊，死傷未詳。哈物拉附近有一臽砲彈爆炸。據警察報告，拉山德恩之自來水站曾發生火警。巴勒斯坦英軍司令麥美倫今晚乘鐵甲車赴高級專員克寗漢寓所，殆係舉行緊急會議。據新聞處宣布，政府即將有重要通告發表。</p>
<p>猶恐怖團直認不諱</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷一日電〕猶太恐怖團伊爾根黨今應承認耶城英軍官俱樂部係彼等所炸，復曰，此舉在報復英軍這放逐猶太同胞，並曰任何要塞均不足以保護英人。</p>
<h3>國際軍編制　聯合國正研究中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約一日電〕關於組織國際軍隊交由聯合國機構控制事，頃據可靠方面消息，聯合國軍事參謀委員會，已將利用此等軍隊之原則研究竣事，現在研究其編制方法。</p>
<h3>世界銀行</h3>
<p>政策與目標或將變更</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕著名經濟學家波特女士頃在「紐約郵報」發表一文，預料美國國內外政治動向，將使國際發銀行之政策與目標，大爲改變。據稱：該行之美國代表將完全更調，而代以有商業經騐之銀行家。該行將更爲商業化，而缺乏協助世界達成經濟安定，從而促進永久和平之雄心。國際貨缺點協定創立世界銀行之配音，在實際考慮時，將處於次要地位。美國政策之改變不外下列諸困：（一）美國對蘇關係之惡化，蘇聯雖爲貨幣協定之簽字國，但並不成爲國際銀行之一員，結果有數個國家原被美國認爲有價值的借戶者，現已處於蘇聯勢力範圍內，不再有其價值。（二）該行之主要政策或將修改。現正考慮放款應以商業爲蘇　，而不以經濟與政治爲目的。（三）共和黨自去年十一月在政治上獲勝後，對于美國整個外交經濟政策，指摘日甚，國際銀行亦在其例。</p>
<h3>聯國同志會決定在華設立辦事處</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦一日專電〕世界聯合國同志會理事會，本日通過中國代表團之提案，在中國成立遠東區辦事處。理事會派一特別委員會，其中包括中美比英澳荷各國，研究遠東區辦事處之計劃，美代表團倡議在美國募款，以助該區辦事處之成立。理事會復決議派遣同志會秘書長恩納爾，於今夏前往遠東各國考察。同志會今夜將在亞爾伯特堂舉行大集會，並將有若干著名人物講演，其中計有艾德里·艾登·馬薩里克及鄭子錫等人。</p>
<h3>聯合國管理日本　傳麥帥提出建議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社波士頓一日電〕基督教科學家箴言報編輯甘漢姆一日抽，撰文稱：駐日盟軍統帥麥克沃塞將建議，在簽訂日本和約後，儘早將佔領日本事宜移交聯合國管理，作爲集體安全區域之試騐。據稱：當甘氏最近訪問日本之際，麥帥在私人接見甘氏時，曾預先告知此一建議。麥帥認爲下列二事甚爲需要：（一）對日本之適當軍事監視，以保證不違反和約中各項條款。爲達到此項目的，聯合國應叧建國際警察，足以擔任此項監視職務。（二）指導，培植及協助一切完成民主之技術問題，爲達到此目的，聯合國應派遣國際民政專家赴日。</p>
<p>該報並摘引麥帥之言稱：「和平與戰爭之問題百軍事聊天工具所可解決，須出人類精神上之覺悟解決之」云。</p>
<p>〔中國新聞社波士頓二日電〕陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾昨日向某報訪員談稱：聯合國之佔領日本，可作爲將來任何集體安全機構之模型，將來對日和約締結後，佔領任務仍當繼續進行，其法日本之教育則將由聯合國之民政機構加以民主化。</p>

<h3>美國進出口銀行　對戰後世界復興貢獻甚多</h3>
<p>一九四六年這一年曾是美國積極參與安定戰後世界的一年。可是如果說戰後恢復世界經濟的巨大努力已經有了頭緒的話，那么迄未完成的任務還是十分艱巨。</p>
<p>在這種巨大的善後努力上，美國肩負著較大的一部分。這種努力表現三個特點：首先美國是全世界所需救濟與建設貨品的主要來源，其次，其他各車情況不佳，迫切需要物資而並不能立即付款，因此一個很大的資金問題發生了。第三，建設所需巨額經費使巨大的債權國遭遇了一個巨大的償付問題。</p>
<p>至於第一點，美國具有生產爲善後所需貨品的能力是無疑的。因此它雖有國內復原這一項巨大的工作，在一九四五年七月至一九四六年七月之間輸出了八十七億五千萬元的日用品，此刻輸出仍在繼續增加，按現在的數量一年可達一百億元，其中還並不包括脫售的租借與剩餘物資三十八億元在內。</p>
<p>至於第二點，即資金問題的性質與大概的數量，這問題美國政府早在對日戰爭勝利日以前已經看到，這種經費大別可分三類——救濟的資金，長期性建設與開發所需資金，平衡美國預算不足所需資金。</p>
<p>如所公認，最窮困的一些國家的緊急救濟應按純然慈善的性質辦理。聯總這國際性的這一目的而成立，美國總共供獻聯總的經費達二十七億元，或者說它全部經費百分之七十。</p>
<p>一九四四年七月所訂布里敦森林協定規定成立世界銀行，作爲供給長期性建設與開發所需對外借款的一個主要的戰後機構。不過，由於批准費時，世界銀行的業務到現在才開始進行。占後緊急的需要決非私人資本所能應付，因此爲了避免出口驟减，致而不利於經濟與社會的善後，在世界銀行力能供給戰時破壞的世界以緊急建設所需經費以前，美國供給一些信用借款實在。爲了應付這種情勢，美國國會一九四五年進出口銀行法案中，增加了該行貸款權力由七億元至三十五億元，並且取消了該行不可借款與對美國債務不清的國家的禁令，並且把該行的經理事務由兼職的保管委員會轉交專資而由兩黨合組的董事會手中。</p>
<p>善後努力的第三個特點為是長期信用貸款償還的必要，這問題倒是美國勢將遭逢的棘手問題，美國如果希望這種貸款得到償還的話，美國人民遲早應面臨一種進口貨泛濫的情勢。</p>
<p>進出口銀行爲履行一九四五年進出口銀行法案所規定的任務，曾承諾爲一般建設目的的借款數達二十億六千五百萬元，這些信用貸款中包括原來租借計創名下購貨所需的六億五千五百萬元，爲緊急建設需要的十二億七千七百萬元，以及爲購賣棉花所用一仙三千三百萬元。在第一燈內法國得款五仙五千萬元，比利時得款五千五百萬元，荷蘭得五千萬元，埋藏均爲卅年，利息各爲二厘又八份之三；第二類爲供給比，丹，芬，法，荷，荷印，挪，波，中，阿比西尼亞與沙地阿剌伯等國的借款，貸款的數目由對阿的三百萬至對法的六億五千元不等，趕時間由對荷的兩年到大多數二十五至卅年不等，長期貸款的利息多是年息三厘，僅少數例外，棉花貸款多半貸與歐洲國家，但貸與中國的棉花貸款也達三千三百萬元。這種貸款時間較短，由十五個月至二十四個月，年息二厘。</p>
<p>以後由了求過於供，進出口銀行不得不採行限制緊急建設借款，以適應借貸者最低限的迫切需要，因此銀行當局對於所有借款聲請一律按借貸者需要的緊急性，借貸者自己的財源，由其他來源獲取貸款的可能，借貸者有效使用借款的能力，貸款對美國經濟的影響等各點，加以審慎研究。</p>
<p>世界銀行的貸款業務即將於最近開始，進出口銀行的緊急建設貸款時期進出口銀行的今後計劃。</p>
<p>進出口銀行的根本目的業由國會明定，即協助「進出口業所需資金，並協助美國與任何外國，或外國之機關或個人進行貨品交換所需資金。」該行具有處理一般銀行業務的廣泛職權，並作任何種類的借款，只要它行使的職權有助於基本目的，它可以借貸給任何借款者，其數量亦無所限制。</p>
<p>銀行成立以來，始終準備在適當條件之下協助美國的進出口商。協助出口商的辦法通常是貸款與個別美國出口商，供給其購買特定物資與設備之資金。戰爭結束後，向進出口銀行請借不能由其他么立銀行獲得的信用貸款的出口商爲數漸增。美國出口管制的漸鬆與外國對美國貨品要求的日增，都是出口業大爲擴展的原因。不過也正像戰前一樣，美國出口商販買的業務係在下太空三種條件之下進行：日用品的式樣，處國買主的能力，其他供應者的競爭。旣然信用貸款的時期較一般商業銀行所能通融的時間爲長，出口商自然樂於向進出口銀行貸款。銀行過去對於所有這種性質的合法要求都一律受理，今後也決定繼續受理。</p>
<p>到目前爲止銀行還沒有作過對進口商的貸款，不過主一點原因不在銀行不願允與這樣的信用貸款，而是在一秀美國進口商在商業銀行等方面都有辦法借到相當的資金。</p>
<p>進出口銀行的董事會認爲進口增加也是美國戰後健全而繁榮的貿易的要素，銀行對於這件事情具有特別興趣，因爲銀行章程作有特別規定即銀行在借款以前，必須具有獲得償還的合理保證。同時銀行董事會認為如果復興世界貿易與重建有效的多邊貿易制度能成功，所有得有緊急建設借款的國家都將毫無償還借款困難。</p>
<p>同時我們銀行認爲要世界貿易復活與償還問題有效解決最大希望在於美國進口精氣合理擴展，同時美國的對外借款如果不能無限期延展，借款國家要能清償債務並繼續向美國購買對它們有利的貨品，也只有靠美國進口業這一點。</p>
<p>由於世界銀行的早期業務即將開始，進出口銀行今後建設開發借款的問題就極受各方注意。其實早在美國對外貸款計劃創擬時，美國政府已經預見，一俟世界銀行接辦業務，進出口銀行長期性的爲建設與一工發的借款一定大爲緊縮。人們始終認爲，作爲對外建設開發借款的主要機構應爲世界銀行而非進出口銀行，進出口銀行的方針決非與世界銀行競爭，而是與它充分合作，它認爲從今以後長期的建設開發借款應在世界世界銀行職權之內，不過這不是說進出口銀行今後將不再考慮拉丁美洲國家以及其他國家短期的建設開發借款，也不是說進出口銀行對於以後的緊急建設借款一律停辦。</p>
<p>進出口銀行認爲在特別的情況之下，即某些愛戰爭破壞的國家並非世界銀行會員，因此不能向世界銀行申通借款，進出口銀行給與某種金融上的協助也許仍舊需要。不過銀行資金有限，並非全在全能，它只能在各該國基本問題能通過其他辦法得到廣泛解決前作應急補救。（美國新聞處）</p>

<h3>滬光戲院對面火燒　三小時始炸燬店面五家　病婦灼傷獨子慘斃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中正由路（即愛多亞路）滬光大戲院對面永康漆號，昨晚不塡起火，延燒達三小時之久，共計燒毀店面五家，火首主婦楊樓氏被均傷，其年僅七歲之獨子楊志剛慘遭焚斃，茲誌其詳情於后：</p>
<p>昨晚七時五十分，記者道經泰山區消防隊，忽聞警鈴聲大作，即有皮帶車一輛疾駛而出，幫浦水軍維之，行動至為敏捷，惜車機過舊，駛行較慢，記者會聞一非值抵之消防員嚕嘛謂：此種車輛，祗能拋諸垃圾箱中。</p>
<p>記者旋即尋聲至滬光大戲院附近，其時戲院對面之古舊店房，己火光融融，泰山區駛出之幫浦東一輛，停於戲院側道，接水灌救，消防員皆奮勇非凡，或站於樓窗前，或高踞電桿頂，或爬於屋面上，以手電簡為前導，四面苗子集中火燄澆射，然昨晚因西北風勢猛烈，火借風威，居於下風之店房，在　澆之下依然迅速蔓延，大有一發不可收拾之勢。</p>
<p>當時火場圍觀如堵，而火場貼隣之電燈，照明如常，約於半點鐘後，電綫始經剪斷，以免意外，猛烈火燄於九時後方告逐漸消滅，十時許全部救熄。火熄之後，記者赴火場察看，該處一帶房屋，為舊式一樓一底市房，居戶身份大抵為中下階級，故除屋而加築有木棚店而外，屋內並建有二層攔，此固極易引起火災者也。火首一一三〇號店主楊錦華，崇明人，三十八歲。失火時，彼適外出，僅彼妻楊樓氏（三十一歲）與子楊志剛臥於二樓，楊樓氏患有重傷，呻吟床第，業已月餘，被雖於烈火中逃出，而其獨子志剛則不幸葬身火窟中。</p>
<p>捨子逃命淒其欲絕</p>
<p>除火首永康漆號全部焚毀外，其貼隣遭殃者有一一三二號，一一三四號，一一二八號，一一二六號大餅店炒貨店牛肉店等除二三〇，一一三二，一一三四號全燬外餘兩家僅樓面被燬。</p>
<p>記者於得悉火首楊樓氏臥於滬光大戲院二樓時，復趨前訪問，楊樓氏臥於滬光二樓客堂間之沙發上，上覆棉被，面色焦黃，右手露於被外，已遭灼傷，此外腿部亦受重傷。記者詢以起火情形，彼悽然答曰：起火時，家人皆在樓上進晚餐，僅彼及其子臥於二層棋，起火之處常為樓下，迨其幼兒志剛發覺時，彼即掙扎起床，雖欲抱子同逃，奈體病力衰，無法抱起，而火勢已逐漸迫近，不得己始捨子逃命，而其子之慘呼聲猶於火光中傳出，楊樓氏述至此，幾至涕下，蓋彼膝下僅一子一女，今其子竟彼焚斃，亦云慘矣。楊樓氏旋為其親屬扶至醫院診治，楊志剛之屍體，亦經消防員掘得，遍身焦黑，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>各消防員水透內衣</p>
<p>昨晚參加灌救之消防隊，有泰山區·新閘區·法華區等各隊，到塲之州消防車計四輛，灌救確甚出力。記者目睹二三七號消防員高站雲梯上施救，為濃烟所黨達一小時之久。據泰山區徐區隊長告記者謂：參加消防工作者，無一不濕透內衣，彼本人昨着新西裝觀足球歸隊，得警報後，不及更衣，大受損失。記者昨見消防隊所用皮帶，雖有破裂，惟尚堪用，因而撲滅迅速。火熄後，並有義警一隊趕至。至於起火原因，傳說不一，有謂起於火油爐，有謂起於電綫破裂，現警局正調查中。</p>
<p>公平路底焚燬草屋</p>
<p>公平路底沙虹路一帶空地，貧民搭蓋之草棚甚多，昨日午後五時，因煮飯不愼，遺落火星一轉瞬間火勢蔓延，不可收拾。幸經消防隊得訊，到塲灌救，結果焚燬草屋四間。</p>

<h3>收容孤苦女孩的善牧會救濟院　教導她們識字和技能　成為良好的職業婦女</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的救濟機關，說來似乎不少，可是為女孩子設立的收容所，却是鳳毛麟角。在這少之又少的幾個中間，貝當路九一〇號美善牧會救濟院就是一個，而是設備比較完善的一所，已經成立了十四年，可是外界知道的人很少，在這一切都困難的當兒，院內的姆姆為着一百十五個和將來有更多的女孩子，不得不開口呼籲。</p>
<p>善收救濟院所收留的女孩子，最小的的八九歲，最大的二十一二歲，都是由窮苦人家的父母或教會的人士送來的，有的孩子因為家世不淸白，無人收留，學校也不要，即由善良的姆姆担負起教養的責任。院裏不願意收留太大的女孩子，因為怕已養成的不良習慣，易於影響年輕的一輩，同時因為經濟缺乏，工作的人少，暫時也不能收容嬰兒，她們主要的目的是要養成一批能識字，能做活的女子，將來可以做一個賢慧的家庭婦女或自食其力的職業婦女。</p>
<p>女孩長大代為擇偶</p>
<p>女孩子長大了，姆姆就給她們挑上個忠實原道的丈夫，必須先行調查對方公婆是否能喜歡他們的媳婦。同時因為她們都是天主教徒，所嫁的人也是天主教徒。</p>
<p>救濟院的院長姆姆弗蘭西絲，在院內已服務十二年，在地教導之下的女孩子都非常能幹，她們在課餘，就學習編結和刺繡以及作花邊之類的東西，因為產量不多，現在還不能正式出售。除了院長姆姆外，還有九位美國女修士，另有一位中國及一位美國女修土，現在美國洛杉磯善牧會研究管理救濟院種種新方法，不久即可歸國。此外，院內還有五位啓明女中的學生，她們熱心公益，自願在該院義務担任職教。</p>
<p>經費來源全恃捐募</p>
<p>除了有十二個學生由家長貼補一部分學費外，其餘都是無家可歸，無依無靠的女孩子，院方亦從不強迫她們離開，有許多女孩子到了應該出嫁的時候，她們還是不願出去，寗可在裏面多做點手工，姆姆對待她們像是自己的女兒一般。救濟院的經費是沒有同定來源的，除了少數教會善士有時慷慨捐助一些，吳市長夫人曾捐助二百萬元，和行總捐助一些麵粉·　床毯外，平時常有一位女修士到街土樂善人家捐募。孩子們每頓吃些白饅頭或黃米飯，四個人永遠吃一隻菜，以前，她們常常向美軍招待所討得剩餘的卷心菜，可是現在道來源也斷絕了，非自己買不可。當記者參觀完畢告辭時，院長姆姆誠懇爽直的向記者說：「我們最希望人們能捐助一些吃的東西和一此錢給我們用來修理房屋，因為房子舊了，時常需要整理，而道筆費用，你們是可想而知的啊」！</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕高厚的墻垣，沉重的鐵鬥，一個個方格的狹的籠，囚禁着活躍的生命。這灰色的巨大的建築上海監獄，春天的風似乎水遠吹不進來。然而，也有例外的，在星期二和星期五的送牢飯日期，該可以算是一絲和煦的春風透進牢獄裏吧！</p>
<p>只許送菜不許送飯</p>
<p>在天剛黎明的時候，犯人的家屬就排在上海監獄右手的小鐵門前，男的和女的，老的和少的，裏面不乏「達官貴人」的眷屬，裝束入時的摩登女郎，手裏提着菜盒。（慣說是「送牢飯」，實際上是只許送菜，不許送飯。）送的是些什麽東西呢？按貽監獄的規定，有如下的幾種：菜點方面：鹹肉，鹹魚，熟鮮肉，熟火腿，肉鬆，鷄鬆，鹹蛋，乾菜，紫菜，榨菜，大頭菜，香春頭，醬菜，乾點心，糖果。用物方面：肥皂，毛巾，牙膏（粉），牙刷，短褲，單夾衫褲，衛生衫褲。</p>
<p>順着號碼依次遞送</p>
<p>送物憑送物證，接見憑探望證。未經高院判決者，祗可送物，不能探望，以防串供。已判決者家屬始可按時探望，排隊入內，將菜點用物以布包袱或網綫袋紮好，由看守順序喊號碼，將菜物交給看守，這犯人妻女精製的肴饌，就和春天的風一樣透進森嚴的鐵窗，使犯人獲得一點溫暖，一點安慰。等到犯人收到菜物之後，空的食盒又由看守送出來，喊著號碼，家屬接過去，這樣「送牢飯」的工作就告完成。</p>
<p>千言萬語從何說起</p>
<p>接見犯人憑探望證請求接見。談話的地點是鑰匙間，談話的時間限制十分鐘，這短短的十分鐘，千言萬語，不知從那一句說起，有的相對無言，只有流淚，等到時間過了，噙着一包淚水走出來，才想起，重要的話一句沒講哩！</p>
<p>有的家屬注視着遠處高樓中狹的籠，犯人們也隔着鐵窗樓向外張望，兩人的眼光接觸了以後，則做着各種的手勢，以表達情意。</p>
<p>羅宋女人一個飛吻</p>
<p>一個羅宋女人，痴痴地注視着感化院中的丈夫，打了一個飛吻，雖然隔着一道法律的高牆，可是在的愛仍舊把他們的精神融和在一起。下午四時以後，「送牢飯」的家屬一個個提着空的食盒回去了。灰色的高樓，灰色的水門汀走道，以及囚在狹的籠裏灰色的犯人，仍舊恢復其灰色的靜肅。</p>

<h3>正大學潮</h3>
<p>— 本報駐贛記者劉藻</p>
<p>一幕磚亂飛的武劇·擊傷了蕭校長的頭部！</p>
<p>「我們要院長」，「我們要教授」，「我們要圖書」……這一連串的標語，不斷在國立中正大學發現。但是，蕭　校長，對此問題，赴重慶，去京滬，幾度的跋涉，無奈多積困難，而未能達到預期的成果。</p>
<p>最近蕭校長一度在學生集會上，談到充實學校內容的經過，知道他雖經克復了百般困難，而獲得一部份儀器，圖書，與教授，但是學校的內部大貧乏了，現有的一部顯微鏡是借的，土木工程系實習工廠的機器沒有，也是從私人方面借來，使得求智慾旺盛的靑年同學，對此難題，有多多少少的苦悶，埋在心頭，所以「要院長」，「要教授」，……的呼聲，深深的印在每個正大同學的心坎。</p>
<p>土木係主任蔡方蔭，因為有三個問題，使與蕭校長之間，有點不快之感，原因是：（一）蔡教授有一部結構學圖書，在泰和時就與校方簽訂備用的合同，但是這些寶貴的珍本，在戰時東遷西搬，損失了一部份，蔡教授曾根據合的，向校方要求賠償，（二）土木系機械工廠的一部份機械，是蔡教授私人資產，最近他曾提出收回的要求，（三）蔡教授是正大在泰和籌辦人之一，並且是工學院的院長，這次蕭鷳長接長校務後，改聘蔡祭為土木系主任兼教授，蔡氏現因兼任行贛總分署工業技正室主任，職務繁忙，曾向校長要求按照教部規定，予以退休，但是教部以目前教授人才缺乏，囑蕭校長代達慰留。蔡教授由於上面的幾種原因，曾經表示過辭意。</p>
<p>土木系學生獲悉此種消息後，以為工學院院長人選未定，系主任又要辭職，對於各人的學業前途，是個莫大的危機，所以在本月十七日深夜，土木系的同學結隊遊行，高喊着：「我們要院長」，「我們要系主任」，「我們要教授」，「慰留蔡院長」，……遊行的行列，到達教職員住宅區，驚醒了吳士棟訓導長。吳氏到塲勸阻無效。十八日早晨十時許，土木系的同學代表，又去見蕭校長，請求挽留蔡方蔭教授。蕭校長對蔡氏辭職一節，表示尚無所聞，他說：如果有其事，校方當懇切挽留。在代表與校長談話時，該系的同學，兩聚在門外喧吵，吳訓導長又到塲勸阻，有的學生喊打，有的不願離去。蕭校長乃出室制止，經面予訓誡後，始行散去。</p>
<p>這場喧吵，就預示學潮的開始。到了下午三時許，工學院機電系三六級和三八級學生，又發出一些「要教授」，「要圖害」的標語，甚至有些氣燥的學生，喊出：「學校不要官僚化」的口號。事件漸漸的擴大，學校襄已經是燃起了學潮之火。理學院的同學又在十八日的晚上，大的是十時左右，結隊遊行，赴蕭校長住宅請願。他們要求增聘教授，添購圖書和儀器。蕭校長將苦心孤詣籌劃的經過，告訴理學院的請願同學之後，事情算是風平浪靜過去了。</p>
<p>當天的晚上十一時許，又有一批同學高呼着：「打倒蕭　」，「明天罷課」的口號。瘋狂的隊伍，經過校長住宅時，蕭校長叫同學集合訓話，但是他們不肯聽從，磚塊亂飛，蕭校長的頭部，就在這時被亂石擊傷。機電系的一個同學，亦因校工逐散，趕跑不及，致將頭部跌傷。開會，遊行，喊口號，……就整整鬧了一個整天，—十八日—學潮就在這些動亂中形成。</p>
<p>十九日晨教授們雖然按時到課，但是有些同學就自動缺課。全體學生總請假，是從二十日起。他們經過二十日下午一時召開的全校大會決定，宣誓不達目的不銷假，並舉行連鎖保證，有十分之八以上的同學簽名，鄉應這次「總請假」。並且由四個學院和五十四茶級班，各推代表一人，組織「國立中正大學各系級聯合護校運動委員會」。四學院及專修科各推代表一人，紐織主席團，一致決議請求：蕭校長辭職，電呈蔣主席，教育部，熊天翼主任，請准蕭校長辭職，向全國各專科以上學校寄發宣言。現在護校運動會的負責人表示：集體請假，決延至蕭校長辭職批准時為止。</p>
<p>蕭校長在十九日下午二時半，於學潮發生後，曾召集全體教職員談話，並報告事件經過，及其本人對此次事件的態度，他決定負責至本月二十日止。二十一日起，校務交校務委員會暫為處理，全體教職員獲此消息後，至為惋惜，當於教職員會議時，決定推舉全體代表，慰問蕭校長，並電教育部懇切挽留蕭校長。各教授亦表示非於學生覺悟自請復課，經教務處通知時，不復上課。</p>
<p>教務長羅容粹，訓導長吳土棟，對於這次學潮的表示，認為：學潮的發生，已是醞釀相當時日，不過無何名目，可以假借，臨此大考前夕，因開數教授有辭意而乘勢煽動，此亦為「牽綫者」所煞費苦心。至於蔡方蔭教授辭職一說，事前毫無所聞。關於聘請教授，已早分別邀定，或因他校聘期朱滿，或仍滯留國外，致尚付闕如。諸課程及院系負責人，因蕭校長抱密缺不濫的態度，且各生選課，均達十八分及二十分，甚有超過者。緩開各課，僅餘政治，畜牧，物理數課，且均可於决一事期補足，這不是虛言所哄騙，可以課程表選課表為對質。所謂學業功課等，全為失掉理智而發的違心之論。</p>

<h3>八戰八勝　東華昨又勝優游　二比零踢來相當精彩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東華隊在甲組足球聯賽中，繼續保持其常勝不敗紀錄，昨日又以二比零擊敗優游，迭成八戰八勝之偉績，上半時零比零未分勝負。甲組錦標，已穩穩在握。昨日風姨肆虐，但球迷仍有六千餘人，雙方踢來相當精彩。戰情如次：</p>
<p>互有攻守</p>
<p>三時十分，雙方列陣，裁判鄧效良，巡邊張樂·陳吉祥，鳴笛開賽，東華逆風先攻，龍海，阿孫，明哲，三騎並進，優游陳效平，雲逢　，左右招架，五分鐘時，曹琴芳暗放冷箭，張邦綸接個正着，東華乘機來製，賈幼良策動攻勢，離門卅碼處遙射，張榮才躍救，得而復失，自橫木彈出，幸未失守。未幾東華五鋒挺進，優游腹地盡為華東控制，羅旭萊離門十八碼處闖禍，孫老錦罰而不入。一刻鐘時，龍海再度偷製，陳明哲冷路竄出，與張榮才跌做一堆，榮才機警，速即爬起，救出險球。不久，羅旭萊又犯規，孫錦順操刀，鐵腿無靈，又告野逸，東華環攻不下，為時頗久，至上半時終場前三分鈸，朱梅龍角球開來，巴瑪力射，適中邦綸懷抱，未遭毒手，上半時隨之終了，〇比〇和局。</p>
<p>連中二球</p>
<p>休息過後，易地再戰，兩軍俱以原班人馬登場，接觸後，優游策動攻勢，東華張林根。韓龍波力拒，二分鐘時，賈幼良右路興兵，遙傳中央，陳明哲凑上一脚，球落門前，韓龍海及時趕到，輕撥入網，一比〇東華首開紀錄。優游痛失首城後，心有不甘，巴瑪率領四鋒疾進，電樹苹盤過莊友仁，近門力射，球出峻急非凡，張邦綸不慌不忙，撲成角球，朱龍梅主開，無功而返。混戰至十八分鐘時，賈幼良再度來犯，張榮才得而復失，韓龍海飛步趕上，一脚入網二比〇東華再報捷音。優游為國報復計，竭力反攻，奈東華後衛嚴密，無法得逞，未獲法定畢，東華又二比〇勝優游，創八戰八勝之偉績。甲組錦標，穩穩在握。</p>

<h3>女子籃球　雪白獲得亞軍　青聯力抗罰剩四人棄權　春茂擊敗恩卡斯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽昨晚有女子組一塲，甲一組兩塲，觀衆踴躍，不下五六百人。女子組雪白對靑聯爭亞軍，雪白不凡，第四節廿六分三十秒時，比數為廿二比十九，靑聯球員祇罰剩四人，女子規則不得續賽，故白戰一塲，雪白作二比〇勝。甲一組第一塲春茂三十八比三十勝恩卡斯，雙方時起肉搏，動作生硬。第二塲海陸靑聯防固若金湯，當然大勝鐵路京，比數為七十五對三　十九，相去懸殊。詳情如次：</p>
<p>雪白勝青聯</p>
<p>女子組決奪亞軍，雪白三前鋒莫不較防軍高大，張秀麗罰擲俱中，朱家珍加分，張又得手，以七分惟我獨尊，靑聯賴孫鳳竹柳惠珊建功，首節雪白七比三佔優勢。</p>
<p>柳惠珊增二分，孫罰進僅一分之差（七—六），雪白王珊入塲替朱家珍，全隊更形聯絡，朱圍中鮮艷「萬綠叢中一點紅」，毛衣聳肩，有上鏡頭姿態。第二節秀麗四分，王慧玲二分，姍姍來遲之王珊獲四分，青聯孫罰得一分，柳罰中二球，第二節遂成十六比六。</p>
<p>第三節戰至廿一比七時，靑聯調整陣綫，李惠珍赴前綫，將朱蘭貞調回防守，廿七比七時，蘭貞罰出，祗五人應戰，二前三後，八分鐘過去三十比七。</p>
<p>末節在甘六分三十秒，尚餘三分半時，比數為三十二對九，王文珠罰出，靑聯僅存四人，按規則不能再賽，所有紀錄一筆勾消，雪白以二比〇勝靑聯。</p>
<p>春茂勝恩卡斯</p>
<p>甲一組第一場春茂對恩卡斯，上塲時春茂連得四分，不久，為恩卡斯追成各六平手。何涵夫罰中，春茂又以一分超出，葛朋乞打成平手（八分），此公吃相最兇，肚子一挺，將人彈出數步外。劉福善兩球，春茂十二比八稱雄，黃天烈入易陳家標，增至十六比九，斯時福善己獨得十一分，鐘嗚前再來一球，春茂十九比九勝上半時。</p>
<p>下半時春茂涵夫福善李賢政等得分，恩卡斯發奮自強，葛朋乞格夫。凱羅司分數驟增至甘六，雖仍難遏春茂威風，結果成三十八比三十。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>昨夕籃球聯賽三塲，僅春茂戰勝恩卡斯一幕，較為精彩。黃天烈病愈登塲，春茂攻勢，頓形活躍，控制全局，下半時曾造二十六比十三懸殊比數。</p>
<p>劉福善每役演出，均保持常態，昨賽福善搶擇地位，敵捷準確，遠射近投，無不　中，是最出色的一員。</p>
<p>恩卡斯自勃脫離去，失却中距離射手，為莫補之損失，但其長力與鬥志不衰，依舊可長。昨夕恩卡斯過於自負，未以全神專注緊守福善，至為失策。</p>
<p>何滬夫亦見努力，賢政，福強防守不懈，遂令恩卡斯絕少籃下跟進之機。天烈時優時劣，與鄭彪互相　替上塲。</p>
<p>鮑萊輿E凱羅斯　為恩卡斯較稱職的兩員，但全隊動作，猶嫌粗曇。</p>
<p>距終局五分鐘時，福善被撞倒地，負劍離塲，不久復入，局勢乃得穩定。</p>
<p>上半時福善四决犯規後，即謹愼從事，如福善罰出，勝利將非春茂所有。（昌年）</p>

<h3>中央銀行新舊總裁　定今日辦理交替　貝祖詒昨旮開結束會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國府一日特任張嘉激為中央銀行總裁後，聞張氏將於今晨乘京滬車來滬，可望於上午九時赴央行視事。</p>
<p>央行已定於今日下午四時，在外灘十五號該行行址舉行茶會，招待本市各機關首長，及金融界領袖，同時並辦理新舊總裁交替儀式。</p>
<p>貝組詒氏自呈准辭去央行總裁之職後，業於昨晨偕秘書盧定中由京抵滬。貝氏旋即赴央行辦公，上午十時許，復召集各局處負責人，舉行結束會議，商討辦理移交事宜。貝氏當囑各局處轉飭所屬，於昨日辦理結束，以備於今日移交。</p>
<p>據央行秘書處定中語記者：貝氏素有肺疾，曾於去年九月提出辭呈，未荷邀准。茲再向最高當局懇辭，終蒙批准。貝氏現擬俟移交竣事後，就近赴北平休憩，暫不出任其他新職。盧氏旋出示貝氏向蔣主席懇懇之呈文如次：「敬呈者，竊職於三十五年二月底奉命承乏央行，因身搜肺疾，曾請以試辦六個月為期，九月初齊呈乞義，未蒙俞允，仰荷電慰，獎勉有加，深為感奮。緣是暫肩重任，勉力應付，期能竭其愚庸，仰報萬一。荏苒迄今，又及半載，才力卽無補於艱危，體弱愈不勝其繁劇，引領來茲，曷盡惶悚，籌思再四，為免貽誤職責，懇乞俯鑒微忱，進計辭職，遴員接替，傳得稍息仔肩，以資調攝，容俟他日再圖報効，無任企禱之至。謹呈主席蔣，職貝祖詒謹呈，三月一日。」</p>
<p>又訊：據悉，中央銀行業務局局長林胤苞，外匪審核處處長林維英，副處長徐先達，秘書盧定中。朱崑壽等，業已向貝祖詒氏提出辭呈，並悉已荷貝氏批准。尚有其他借調中國銀行之職員多人，亦均有去意。惟最後之人事調動，尚有待新舊總裁會談後，由新部裁重行部署。聞新總裁上任後，為求業務上之聯計，對林鳳苞·林維英·徐先達·諸氏，或將暫仃挽留，以待物色適當之接任人選。</p>
<p>又央行副總裁張嘉璈出任該行新總裁後，所遺副總裁一職，盛傳將由劉攻芸接任，另一副總裁陳行，則仍維原職云。</p>
<h3>輸管會積極審核　登記進口商資格</h3>
<p>油類進口商核定七十二家</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會對登記進口商資格之審核，近正積極推進中。滋悉：除油類，橡膠，棉花，羊毛等類進口商之資格，業己審核竣事外；刻又對硫化元，靛靑，煤及煤塊，機器川皮帶，蔴袋，米，小麥，小麥粉，蔴等九種進口商資格，審核竣事，本週起將分別調查油脂臘，澱紛，肥料，水泥，軍寗酸，及人造絲等進口商之資格。調查時除將根據各指定銀行所提供之徵信資料外，尚將分着各該類進口商，到會面詢，或着補繳所缺證件，以備審核。</p>
<p>據該會茶負責人語記者：審核進口商資格之事，頗感繁重。審核時係根據海關稅則，每種稅則，均定有一標準，即以民國三十五年各進口商直接進口之營業額為標準。然每一稅則往往包含多種商品，例如五金一項，其下所開列之品名，即達八十四種之多，而一家進口商，往往兼營多種商品之進口業務。為求公允切實計，必須逐一為之番核，以視其是否符合標準。故本市進口商所送進之申請登記書，雖僅三千餘份，而實際審核工作之進行，實即等於審核四五萬份之申請書。故審核工作之延冗費時，癥結即在此。惟現徑積極推進結果，二十五種限額進口物資之進口商資格，業已泰半審核竣事云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：取得油類進口責格之進口商，共計有七十二家。此中計火油三十家，汽油七家，滑潤油膏七家，燃料汕十五家，滑潤油十三家。</p>
<h3>國貨工廠聯合會請放寬原料限額</h3>
<p>本市機製國貸工廠聯合會，自政府實施輸入管理政策以來，因希望放寬進口原料限額，俾得增加生產，經召集各會員工廠數度商討，收納各方意見，擬具理由，請求輸管會准予採納，據該會負責人程守中談稱要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）本會所有各會員工廠，因營業性質不同，需要原料種類至為繁複，輸管會對工業原料進口，卽加以限額分配，則分配第一步驟必須先行調查各種工廠現有動力設備，並請專家精確估計，每合機器需要原料若干，可產成品若干，然後核定分配之限額，則產量卽可增加，物價能亦平穩，民族工業亦得賴以支持。</p>
<p>（二）輸管會核定進口貨物，申請結匯，時問必須迅速，俾便利工業出品，免使各工廠停機，徒耗日常開支。</p>
<p>（三）關於進口貨原料與成品，應請輸管會詳為分類，蓋經限額分配後之數量，在各工廠皆屬必需，若以成品進口貨數量條列規定限額內支配，則原料限額範圍即形减少。</p>
<p>（四）戰後復興民族工業，首在充分供應原料，如原料短少，則圖存困難，發展自匪易，故是項調查工作，極屬重要，如能先行調查，則限額分配亦將適合實際，致人力方面，如一時難以並瞰，則當局可轉令各人民團體共同協助辦理。</p>
<h3>黃金私相授受　不易澈底取締</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自中央頒佈黃金禁止買賣後，金子黑市塲雖告消滅，然私相授受小額交易猶未完全絕跡。記者曾就此點叩詢市長有無所聞時，市長並不加以否認，並稱：彼於若干日之前，曾告宋院長，金禁雖已頒佈，黑市交易猶恐未能制止。宋院長當詢以何故？彼即舉一例稱：設甲携一金條至乙家，並向乙貸款五百七十萬元，此舉旣無犯罪行為，亦不能為軍警當局所獲悉，而黑市交易實已構成矣。對於此項私相授受之交易，市長謂：一時恐難澈底取締。</p>
<h3>台糖復業借款　限兩年內清償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司，最近與中國銀行成立復興台灣糖業借款，計美金五百萬元。該項借款，限兩年內淸償。聞該公司同時已獲得中央銀行核准，將來還款時，得按還款時之官價外匯率，結匯淸償。據悉，該項借款主要用途，係向美國訂購大批糖廠一機器，及交通鐵路等器材。現以借款已有着落，該項器材，全部可望於本年八九月前，分批運台。故本年杪及明年春之產糖計劃，即運蔗量三百萬噸，產糖量三十萬噸，決能如期達成目的云。</p>
<h3>麵粉新價今日實行</h3>
<p>麵紛價格調整，業經吳市長批准，決於今日起正式實施，調整後之新價格為（一）利朗粉七十磅裝者每包七萬元，（二）本粉四十磅裝者每包四萬七千元，此項新價格於今後三個月內決不再行調整，如若超越限價，決依違反議價條例重以重刑。</p>
<p>（又訊）市府定日內召集麵粉商會議，商討洋麵到滬後之分配及政府貼補麵廠等問題。</p>
<h3>敵產工廠重估價短期內可標售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局數產淸理處目前正在進行敵產重估價，廠工部份短期內即可公告標售。有關人士表示：半年來物價波動甚烈，去秋之估價，此時已不適川。剩餘敵偽物資之中，房產佔主要地位，去秋之佔計已值二千億元，目前則遠不止此數。在房產之中，）部份大厦為機用所使用，出售應最為容易；又一部份已配給有力者居住，給償亦應無問題；最成問題者為弄堂房屋，住者不止一戶，主管機關希望能集體交易，以省手續。萬一不能時，將個別與房客接洽出售。至於剩餘之工廠，已多殘破，價值不大</p>
<h3>中國蠶絲公司　調查戰時絲業損失　損失蠶絲二百公担桑樹二十億株　蠶絲業器材損失值戰前法幣三億元</h3>
<p>我國為世界主要育蠶國之一，蠶絲為我國主要外銷物資，亦為我最主要外匯來源，所有在抗戰期間被侵佔之東北及蘇浙粵等蠶絲區域產絲額，佔全國總產額百分之九十，且被佔區田園荒慶，因種場絲廠基礎被毀影響，戰後近六年內產量不易恢後。我國戰前年產絲可達十至十五萬公担，而目前不過一萬五千公担，由此數字可徵被毀之烈。日本絲產，除一小部份自用外，大部份均供外銷，且日本國內現尚有大批存繭，故以其用作我國戰時損失賠償，實最適當，我駐日代表團近繼續據理力爭。</p>
<p>調查全國蠶絲損失</p>
<p>中國蠶絲公司特組織「抗戰期間全國蠶絲損失調查委員會一。推定孫伯和等七人為委員，從事全國性調查。其範圍包括：（一）蠶農，（二）樂園，（三）種塲，（四）繭行，（五）絲廠，（六）有關蠶絲之機關學校，社團之損失。調查內容：（一）築設備直接損失，（二）生產品市接損失營業上間接損失歷年累計，（四）因統制壓價所受損失歷年累計，（五）復員期間損失，（包括增加國庫及人民負担）所調查者包括蘇，浙，皖，川，湘，鄂，桂，黔，粵，滇，魯等省。現蘇，浙，川，等省已有大部報告寄到，將彙編總報告送中央貽償委員會。</p>
<p>我國蠶絲驚人損失</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕銀樓業自中央頒佈黃金禁止買賣後，生計頓告斷絕。曾數度推派代表赴市府請願，聲稱吳市長係本市市民之父母官，對銀樓業同人之患　難，必願予以解救，彼等懇請吳市長於轉進呈文外，並向當局代作口頭上之呼籲，當承吳局長允諾。此番吳市長自京返滬後，記者特趨訪，叩詢在京時對銀樓業前途是否有所商談？據答：確會為彼等代作緊急呼籲，並已向　蔣主席建議一項具體辦法，鄭為准許飾金自由買賣，各銀樓可直接向市民收購首飾，亦可自由將首飾售於市民，唯絕對業禁其買賣金條，或將收購之飾金镕鑄條子後出售。如是則對金市旣無影響，而銀樓業生計亦得藉以維持。吳市長又稱：此項辦法，並曾與俞鴻鈞部長及徐次長等作周密討論，彼等咸認為合理。至於此法是否得以核准，待中央方面會商後，日內可望作最後決定。</p>
<h3>黃狼皮成交多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃狼皮日來交易頗多，國外市價頻頻提高，尤以猶太商吸胃甚強，成交市價每對為三萬六千元，聞紐約市價約為三元五角美金。湖羊皮許久不見，今市亦出現於市塲，每張價為一萬二千元。靑山羊皮每張一萬五千元，權皮每個為一萬六千元，白　皮每個為一萬七千元，均較上日上漲一千元，各貨交易均稱熱鬧，一反過去之沉寂。</p>
<h3>上海水泥廠準備復業中</h3>
<p>四月初可以出貨</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海水泥廠現正準備復業，因近來煤斤缺乏，乃決定自三月份起，改裝柴油引擎，豫計四月初即可出貨，工廠仍在龍華。第一期生產量，現決定為七萬磅。按該廠創立於民國九年，民國十二年正式出貨，戰事發生後，被迫停止營業。勝利後，再度復工，其後因外貨傾銷，銷路缺之，且煤斤購買困難，乃於去年入月，再度停工。該廠出產水泥，原居上海第二位，現因種種波折，已跌至第三位。</p>
<p>又訊：我國水泥工廠，在北方有資源委員會附屬之遼寗水泥廠，錦西水泥廠，華北水泥廠。民營者有啓新洋灰公司，山西有太原水泥廠，江南有中國水泥廠，上海水泥廠等。據啓新公司某負責人稱：該公司水泥之主要銷路，現集中於華中一帶，華北現因氣候關係，尚不需要。該公司運到京滬一帶之水泥，本月份為七千噸，百分之儿十為政府購買，用於隴海，浙赣，及京滬等鐵路。該公司之水泥生產，較之中國水泥公司之數量為多，價格則相仿。目前我國水泥工業，因外匯提高，主要原料之石膏較前漲高五借，包裝之麻袋紙盒等，亦高漲甚劇，而水泥價格漲百分之二十，故外貨傾銷之難關雖已渡過，但原料煤斤之困難，則方興未艾云。</p>
<h3>上海鋼鐵公司　業已籌備就緒</h3>
<p>查我國鋼鐵產量，素以東北為富，東南地區所需鋼鐵原料，大都仰給國外，漏　殊巨，而上海為全國工業中心，所需鋼鐵原料允多，故建設東南工業區重工業之基礎，增加鋼鐵生產，實為當前急務，當局並以鋼鐵增產，為目前建設之一大目標，頃經金融界領袖中央信託局局長劉攻芸氏，代表中信局邀集滬市鋼鐵業陳受昌余名鈺等，組織上海鋼鐵股份有限公司，配合政府鋼鐵增產之計劃，建設華中重工業基礎，减少資金外流，挹注外匯，同時增加就業之機會，該公司經最短期間之努力，業已籌備就緒，據悉已公推劉攻芸氏任董事長，沈熙瑞張麗門陳受昌王爾　諸氏分任常務董事，余名鈺任公司總經理，劉天宏任家昆分任副總經理，並聘請冶金專家唐之肅氏任總工程師，唐漢宗任第一廠廠長，俞恩培任第二廠廠長，朱恒淸任業務部主任，目前該公司黃興路第二廠機械設備，已裝置竣事，如電流供應無問題，下月中即可生產出貨，預計至下半年度，當可大量出產，在目前人超危機中，尤為一積極而有效之補救，對於常前經濟情勞，殊多裨益云。</p>
<h3>配給人造絲　今晨開會決定</h3>
<p>關於人造絲配給，中央信託局負責人昨告記者稱：絲織業配絲，將於今晨開會決定，今日或明日即可配出，在本月份配額未核定前，將先照原配額發配五分之一，又稱：絲織業半數織機已參加，產銷聯營公司，早由當局撥貸原料，故僅餘半數需要配絲，該局對巳參加外銷綢織機，將不再配給云。</p>
<p>紅米步昂</p>
<p>紅米因到存兩稀，市勢日緊，聞汕頭划申之價，在四關以上，故申市較高之貨呌升三四成不一，其勢後市有漲無跌。</p>
<h3>美元在東方的價值</h3>
<p>在亞繼亞洲，多的是貨幣，少的是貨物。結果是今日的美金一元在美國所能買到的東西，比較在東方多數國家所能買到的東西更多。美國「世界報告週刋」最近把美元和東方各國通貨的法定匯率列表比較如左：</p>
<p>中國　一二，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>香港　三·九五元</p>
<p>越南　六，九九披亞斯特</p>
<p>暹羅　九·九三巴特</p>
<p>新加坡　二·一二元</p>
<p>菲律濱　二比索</p>
<p>日本　一五圓</p>
<p>朝鮮　五圓</p>
<p>荷屬東印度　二·六五盾</p>
<p>錫蘭　三·三〇盧比</p>
<p>印度　三·三〇慮比</p>
<p>蘇聯　五·三〇盧布</p>
<p>阿富汗　一三·五〇阿富汗尼</p>
<p>伊朗　三一·七五里亞爾</p>
<p>伊拉克　〇·二五地那</p>
<p>土耳其　二·八一鎊</p>
<p>上列數字中多數並不能眞正代表各該國通貸的實際上的購買力。各國都有黑市存在，因為民間喜歡收藏穩定的美鈔。例如在中國，美鈔對法幣的法定匯率過去是美金一元折合法幣三三五〇元，最近始改為一二〇〇〇元。在伊朗法定匯經是三一·七五里亞爾，但在黑市中須四十里亞爾折合美鈔一元。大概美元在黑市的購買力比較照法定匯率時為強。原因之一是東方各國的貨幣流通數量已大見增加，而生產量仍遠較戰前為低落。結果是物價高漲到美元在亞洲所能購買的東四比較在國內所能購買的為少。</p>
<h3>去年麝香輸出　值國幣十億餘元</h3>
<p>麝香為製造香水及香水精重要原料之一，以產於我國西康省為最佳，品質優良，每年均有相當數量出售，據統計去年我國麝香輸出的三千三百公兩，的值法幣十億餘元，惟實際出口，尚超過此數甚鉅，蓋麝香係貴重物品，分量極輕，易於携帶，故走私輸出者至多，無法統計，我國麝查以美國吸納最多，佔輸出百分之八十左右，戰前法國香水製造業發達，由我國轍入麝香為數可觀，戰後大見遜色，去年僅有八九千萬元之交易云。</p>

<h3>江北韓僑百態</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽二朋廿日航訊　本報特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>腰緊長統裙，穿着小上衣，潔白，淡紅，顏色襯托得艷鮮，明期，形式猶存古風，加上飄曳着的裙帶，走起來，雖然不能說都是「婀娜生姿」，但，好多的是够美麗的了，這是高麗年靑女人的裝束。至於韓人志士，義勇軍，在東北所表現的勇敢和智謀，有血，有淚，有骨頭，是一部可歌可泣的奮鬥史；韓農動樸耐勞，種稻的幹勁和收穫，也是為人所稱通的，到東北來過的人，大概多能賞識吧。</p>
<p>東北同胞們，看到了棘僑的英勇和美麗，同時也看到了另外一批人的醜惡和齷齪，那些人是鬼祟，卑鄙，蠻橫，仗勢欺人，販製毒品，東北同胞，不知受了他們多少凌辱和毒害，他們是以以「亡國奴老大哥」的身份來橫行和賺錢的。</p>
<p>敗類的韓僑，毒害我們的東北同胞，我們東北同胞，吃他們的苦頭太多了，有冤無處訴，有理不能伸，如果鬧到日本衙門去，還是我們的同胞吃虧，以致惹起了東北人士，人人對韓僑的頭痛和仇視，暗地裏大罵「高麗棒子」！</p>
<p>這責任是要由日人負的，不能設完全是韓僑的劣根性，因為日人要使韓人成為劣等民族，要使韓人成為惡棍，日人好坐收漁人之利，又惟恐韓僑團結，更從中做離間工作，所以養成了韓僑互，不信任，以及意見紛歧的現狀。</p>
<p>兩百萬人口</p>
<p>過去，居留東北的韓僑，數目實在不少，根據偽滿的統計，共有二百萬人，約當柬北地區她人口百分之五強，考據歷史，韓人最早僑居東北的歷史，已經遠在數百年以前了。</p>
<p>九·一八事變時，東北韓僑的有一百五十萬人，這裏可分三大類，一種是原住中韓邊界的韓僑，一種是從日本併吞朝鮮後流亡到東北米的，第三種是日本侵佔東北後，由日本支持而移民東北的人們。</p>
<p>韓僑分佈東北地區，多數的是在中韓邊界地帶，松花江和遼河流域，以及各大小城市，職業百分之九十是農民，所餘的是經營工商的人們，再有就是「為非作歹」「作惡多端」的人們了。</p>
<p>大部份的韓僑是農人，所以東北谷地水田，多由着韓農耕種，所有的水田，大部份是在日人的殖民政策下所強佔的，因為這樣，各地居民和韓僑間的情感，發生了許多的不和睦事件。</p>
<p>勝利了戰火瀰漫着，蔓延着，地面不安定，沒法播種下去，好多強佔的土地，韓農不敢種了，因而各地水田至少荒廢了三分之一，其他各城市的韓僑，原先在日人勢力下所建立的生活經濟　礎，也多崩潰了，於是韓僑的生活，陷入了極端貧困的地步。</p>
<p>韓僑自動經瀋陽安東過江返國的。約有五萬人，年前經駐韓美軍負責送回國的，的二千五百人，現東北九省韓僑，尚有一百三十萬人，在國軍收復區域裏的，約有四萬人，其餘的八九萬人，在共軍佔領區裏。</p>
<p>部分的遣送</p>
<p>我政府對東北一百餘萬韓僑，根據以往的一貫政策，保持優遇態度，所以處理方針，一本寬大，以期中韓兩民族實行親善，努力於東亞和平，對於善良韓僑，一體准其繼續居留，協助生產，不善良的將來在兩國共同協議下，遣送同國，對於韓僑產業，也因東北情形特殊，由東北行轅參照現地情形，擬定處理辦法，現方在行政院審核中，聽說這個辦法，已由外交部集合有關機關審核完了，即可由行政院公佈施行</p>
<p>卅五年的夏季，瀋陽韓僑成立了一個「瀋陽韓僑總會」會長申肅，在去年秋季去南京的途中，遇到了北平軍調部美方人士，當時談及東北韓僑難民有數萬人，毫無生計，打算回國，苦無路可通，美代表尤為電請東京麥帥，不久得到了回電，允許遣送難民回國，但不得超過一萬五千人，幷且限定住在南鮮自動願意回本國的因為美國太平洋全盤遣送工作，至卅五年末終了，規定遣送韓僑船隻，在十二月卅一日以前返還東京，我方接獲通知，已近十二月，為期太短，韓僑方面，更強半不願回國，所以結果只集中二千五百人，費了很大的力量，送出了東北。</p>
<p>這次遣送韓僑，我國供給車船，膳宿，衛生，醫療等一切用費，待遇從優，因而名為遣送，實際是護送，被遺僑民，頗知歌頌我方德意，以後倘韓僑不自動要求，將不再遣送，這是東北遣送韓僑的經過和原委。</p>
<p>稻米與韓農</p>
<p>東北韓僑，在八·一五東北光復以前，不下二百萬人，已經開懇水田五百十七萬畝，全部稻米產量，約可達四百二十餘萬石，實常東北高糧全部產量六分之一。到了卅五年，水田荒蕪過半，稻米產量，已不足供給東北需用，再如此下去，對於東北整個稻米生產，實有問題，因為東北農民在習慣上，體力上，生理上，都不善於種稻，勢非利用韓農不可，今後若打算維持東北稻米產量，借重韓農，實為一大要圖。今天，收復區裏，韓僑經營的工業，已經恢復開工的，計有瀋陽的膠皮工廠二家，鐵工廠三四家，「精米工廠」六七象，長春有鐵工工廠和「精米工廠」五六家，此外在吉林和營口，安東等地，也各有幾家鐵工廠和「精米工廠」。</p>
<p>潘陽「韓國僑民會」，最近代表全體在瀋韓僑，上書瀋陽市政府說：「住瀋的韓僑，因為中央寬大政策的昭示，以及政府愛護韓僑的努力，使韓僑不僅得到精神上的安慰和解放，同時關於韓僑復員事務，也得順利進行，在過去一年間，韓農所耕的水田有三千餘垧，己恢復的小學二十餘所中學二所，已經開市的工商業數十家，並准許「韓僑產業獎勵會」購買韓農所生產的稻米，以供軍糧，使韓僑得有表現中韓友誼的機會，至為感激」。</p>
<p>此外，不能否認的，今天還有少數的韓僑，在背地裏作着鬼崇的事，以及販賣毒品的勾當，和我們的無知同胞勾結着犯法，同時因為禁舞，好多的高麗舞女，另改生路，一些操皮肉生涯的妓女，多半用了我們同胞的錢，這些同胞做了他們的老板，粗野，病症，在貽害我們的武裝弟兄和勞苦階級的同胞們，瀋陽的十間房遂用街，就是這般的情形。</p>
<p>中韓新關係</p>
<p>我國政府，扶植韓國獨立運動，已有卅多年的歷史，所耗費的人力，物力，財力，是不可以數計的，一直到了今天，我政府對於韓國代表團，仍按月補給經費若干萬元，當着「開羅會議」的時候，蔣主席首倡韓國獨立之議，勝利後，仍保持一貫政策，支持該國臨時政府。</p>
<p>臨時政府主席金九先生返國後，我政府寄與深厚的同情，准其留有代表團駐在中國，以當外交使節，處理僑民事務，現在代表團的團長濮純方，因病滯留在瀋陽，並在潘陽西塔，設有韓國代表團東北總辦事處。處長步光，是「中國通」，民國五年，畢業於北平中國大學，其後始終留在中國，為祖國獨立而奮鬥，至於東北僑民方面，各地組有「韓僑民會一瀋陽市更有韓僑總會，為東北韓僑代表的總聯構。</p>
<p>當國軍進駐錦州的時候，東北保安司令長官部，首先成立「韓僑事務處」，專辦韓僑口的調查，產業的登記等事務，到了卅五年秋季，蔣主席諭令關於鮮。台。德·奧僑務事宜，統歸外交部辦理，於是前長官部韓僑事務處，在卅五年九月廿六日，變成了「外交部東北特派員公署韓僑事務處」，韓僑事務處處理全般東北韓僑事務：像關於韓僑良　的甄別，韓僑的保障，戶口的統計，產業的處理，教育的改進，難民的救濟，水田的增產，思想謬誤的加以糾正等等，都在業務範疇之內。</p>
<p>外交部東北特派員張劍非，對記者說：「今天，東北韓僑事務，關係極重要，同時我們對於韓僑更應有一種新觀念，幷盡量扶助他們！」</p>
<p>我們希望韓僑能够認淸敵友，能够回憶一下中韓過去的歷史，能够明瞭中韓兩國將來在這個世界的關聯，加以重大的努力，把中韓兩國友誼的基礎，普遍的堅強的建立起來！</p>
<h3>遼北教育</h3>
<p>— 長春十六日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>遼北教育接收工作，分為兩個階段，自去年一月十日開始，至三月十七日共軍攻陷四平街，是第一接收階段，此期間只接收了偽民生廳之文教科一科，幷奉令暫維持現狀，人員不得增减；自五月廿三日第二接收階段開始，才實際展開接收工作。</p>
<p>二期接收工作</p>
<p>蒙旗教育與內地各地不同接收理應設專科負責辦理，目前教育廳僅設有中等教，國民教育，社會教育三科，蒙旗教育未另設專司</p>
<p>第二期接收工作中，計接收偽滿國立及省立師範學校四校，偽四平省立國民高等學校廿一校及職業學校五校，計三十校，一律改為省立。幷將接收學校按其性質予以分併，按地方需要予以調整者，計增設師範九校，中學廿校，職業學校五校，共計卅四校。改訂學制之措施，將師道學校改為師範學校，劃分籍易師範兩科，國民高等學校改為中學，分高中初中兩部職業學校則區分為高級初級兩部。</p>
<p>中小學教師的訓練與甄審是光復後教育行政上一重要課題遼北教育應舉辦的訓練工作：（甲）中小學教師講習會，日期二週，訓練教師一百二十人，（乙）中學教職員訓練班，日期三週，受訓教職員二百零九人，夏賽方面組織甄擊委負會主持其事，原來計劃以訓練方式行考核之實，因經費困難而終止。</p>
<p>教育冬眠未動</p>
<p>國民教育現狀，根據去年十月統計，全省收復二百六十九街村中，復課的學校七百五十四校，現有學生八萬六千三十七名，教員二千六百五十二人，至於社會教育方面，因社會不安，民窮財盡，推動起來很不容易，目前在冬眠狀態中。</p>
<p>蒙旗教育目前根本無法推動，償由教育應把它列入教育計劃中，擬於收復後重建的學校，計有王爺廟中學，王爺廟女子中學，科左中旗中學，科左前旗中學，科左後旗高農職校，王爺廟高級農業職校，王爺廟初級職校，王爺廟醫學專科，王爺廟師範學校及女子師範學校，以上各校均為省立，幷計劃於五年內完成蒙旗師資教育，可造就師資三千人，就學見童增加至十萬人。</p>
<p>工礦農收狀態</p>
<p>前面說過遼北還是在軍事狀態之下，建設步驟頗為遲緩。就工礦而言，經過「三一七」之變亂，關於工礦調查之資料盡數焚毀，全省工商漁礦之現狀及破壞程度均無詳細調查，僅知目前省營工廠四處：（甲）農具製造廠（去年六月二十日開工）。（乙）改良蹄鐵工廠（八月廿九日開工）。（丙）模範鐵工廠（八月廿日開工）。（丁）民生供應社，以上均為接收偽工廠改組而成。</p>
<p>就農牧而言：其建設有（甲）成立省營農場，為實行共同經營，集體生產，以求逐漸達成現代化之農業經營，利用梨樹縣東遼河流域及昌岡縣實利鎭一帶業經繳明發價之開拓田，將其未完成之灌溉工程繼續興修作為集體農場，東遼河農場已於去年十月成立，此外開原縣寇河，馨盤山未完成之水利工程繼續典修，利用附近尚未發價之土地成立合作農塲。（乙）成立東遼河水利工程機構。東遼河泛濫成災，有很長的歷史。敵偽為防止水患，會於上游梨樹縣石嶺村和滴打嘴子地方修築大型蓄水壞堤，並於其下游小城子孤家子一帶施行灌溉工程，後由投降中止，光復之後此項工程決予繼續，去年七月行政院水利委會及行總東北分署會同遼冀省府共同會議，決議成立東遼河水利委員會，負施工監督指導之責，並成立東遼河水利工程局，負設計施工之責，堰堤工程現正極力修築，下游灌溉方開始勘測。（丙）為期改良家畜品種，以發展全省畜牧改良總場，在遼陽臥虎屯設立分場一所，以經費人才之缺乏，成效甚微。</p>
<p>遼北交通新綫</p>
<p>就交通而言：遼北交通以公路為主幹，依軍事上之需要，公路分二級依次興修，已修復之公路橋樑如左，計主要公路路面修復一千四百公里，橋棵修復一千三百九十座，次要公路路面修復一千三百公里，橋樑修復一百座。此外尚計劃闢新綫兩條，一條是開（原）西（安）公路長一百廿四公里，橋棵十六座，一條是平（四平）海（龍）公路長一百九十公里，橋樑三十三座，均已勘測完畢，行轅特撥款三百萬元作興修開西公路之補助經費，業已開始動工。</p>
<p>遼北的天然富源極為雄厚，凡工礦農收都且備優越條件，所感缺乏的是資金及組織力量，此兩項問題如獲解決，遼北建設前途甚有可觀。</p>
<h3>黃汜區完成三計劃　準備實施復興工作　二月廿八日合肥訊</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員康風</p>
<p>皖東北黃泛區災民，業已渡過可怕之寒冬。民卅五年為水災澈底受難之人民，據皖善救分署葉元龍署長云：其數字在九十萬人，不如外傳之盛。此九十萬災民中，難童部份，已以六百個難童站收容九萬名。淮河復堤的工程吸收壯丁災民三萬人至十萬人，餘者約有數萬名左右，在濱水區捕魚為生。故凡事生產者，其飢荒已因獲得工賑麵粉及漁獲品而得减輕。眞正死亡數字，不超過萬人。現皖省所可動員之人力物力，皆在為黃泛區復興而準備實施工作。分署農業技術室蔣滌舊教授，已完成三種計劃：</p>
<p>（一）復耕　已向上海聯總索取曳引機，在五河，鳳陽，壽縣，阜陽，設立曳引機流動站，每站配機五部，每日每部耕地五十畝，使黃泛區復能下種。</p>
<p>（二）種籽　種籽籌供，因麥作期過，行政院批准五萬石，高粱，大豆。小米種撥交供用。此外，行總麵粉三百噸換取高粱大豆種籽，行總另撥二百五十噸棉種，十五噸，蜀黍供用。估計四百萬黃泛區受災田地，由上列種籽又下種二百萬畝，餘者，去年冬季水退後，已由農民自行下種復耕。</p>
<p>（三）農貸　中央已決定撥發廿四億元，由蕪湖農民銀行派人在皖東北貸放，以便災農購買復興用具。蔣滌舊氏認為目前復耕時期，三月底以前，必需下種，而中央及聯總所允撥款之曳引機，種籽，款項，必須及時撥交到達，以便展開應用，倘若延遲，農業季節性將使黃泛區復興受挫。三月五日在蚌埠召開之皖農輔會，即決定下級應行齊全之農技人乎及區城分配。</p>
<p>蔣教授全力治蝗綠色恐怖可屏除</p>
<p>卅五年六月至十月，皖東北十五縣蝗虫綠色恐怖，可能使得秋收遭受重大打擊，蔣滌舊教授以全力發動治蝗，他區剷廿四個中心捕蝗站。一歲至二歲的跳行幼蝗三斤，換麵粉一斤。五歲飛行老蝗一斤，換粉一斤。蝗卵一斤，換粉四斤。五個月中，三次實行大捕蝗。四十萬軍警男女老幼總動員，在皖東北大地的高粱麥豆綠葉里捕蝗，共捕殺蝗虫三百四十萬斤，救護了萬噸以上麥糧生產，為皖東北有史以來之初次成就，預卜一定年蝗害今可以减輕。</p>

<h3>共軍在察哈濱</h3>
<p>— 張家口二月十五日快訊　本報駐察記者竭忠</p>
<p>該是陽春季節，塞外還在飄雪，春風送不來生氣溫暖，察省人民一直還在悲愁驚恐的苦海。</p>
<p>察省的收復，已經四個多月，國軍經過最大的努力，控制了所有城市和交通錢，平綏路通車了，火車在修復的便道上緩綏爬行。由北平到包頭，整天載運著旅客和貨物，這條受過創傷的動脈，給察緩兩省人民帶來了營養和希望。平張綫只有過兩次小的破壞，張同綫通車以來，還沒有發生過意外。張垣與各縣的公路，都已安全的通行，城市治安，目前已大致穩定。</p>
<p>共軍由於戰略錯誤招致了不可補救的失敗，集寗懷來等戰役又吃過不少苦頭，他的主力撒離了察境，大股的活動己攝服歛跡。察東的叢山峻嶺，一向是共軍的根據地，現在還有三個旅的兵力，大的七八千人，在作「流寇」式的竄擾。雲澤領導一枝數量不多的人馬，活動在察北蒙旗貝子廟一帶，政治的作用超過了軍事價值。察南蔚廳大南山，是共軍晋察冀邊區的老窠，雙方均陳重兵把守，看樣子還都沒有積極企圖。</p>
<p>這一切，說明察省的軍事，短時間不會爆發大規模戰鬥，開展綏靖工作是國軍的任務，人民的希望。</p>
<p>目前，中共的幹部，仍在變本加厲的製造災難與罪惡，中共的政治組織，並沒有和軍事一齊撤退，在所謂「縣不離縣，區不離區，鄉不離鄉」的號召下，一部份幹部被派回自己的區鄉做內錢工作。其餘的仍在山地的邊緣，和國軍控制力所不及的空隙內活動，他們憑藉地理熟悉，地形複難，組織嚴密，情報明確等有利條件，當國軍來剿除的時候，就化整為零變的無影無踪。</p>
<p>夜是共軍活動最好的掩護，靠近他們根據地的鄉村，零星的共軍幹部會在夜間竄來。要吃要喝。報復殘殺，甚至徵糧徵布。要鞋要襪。要肉要紙烟。年靑的男人，因怕共軍裏去常兵，夜晚不敢在家住宿，冒着零下二十多度的寒冷，躱在渠溝山坡中度夜，要一直等到天亮。</p>
<p>共軍竄優的區域，人民的生命就失去保障，共軍最仇視的是為人民選出帮助政府做事的保甲長，及替國軍服務過的同胞，逐鹿縣被共軍殺害了廿五個保甲長，懷來縣被殺了三個，使人民視當保甲長為畏途，政府亦只得每天限人民輪琉擔任。崇禮縣的一家民戶有一次國軍幾個士兵路過，他們熟烈的招待，端出「油糕」來慰勞，沒有兩天，這兩個同胞深夜就被共軍挑死！一個六十多歲的老漢，因給國軍做過一頓飯，被共軍將兩手割掉。共軍眞把殺人「鬧着玩」，春節以後，在懷來縣的一個村莊扭「秧歌」，拌演舊劇中的「鍘美案」，竟把三個良善人民，當做陳世美活活的鍘死！共軍每到一地，嘗讓人民趕快離開，這呌做「跑情况」，於是他們到處埋設地雷，企圖陷害國軍，人民因此死於地雷下的實無法估計。</p>
<p>經過共軍鬥爭過的地方，房屋不是沒頂蓋，就是缺窗少門，零下二十幾度的嚴寒，人民缺衣沒燒，有的把心愛的傢俱當做燃料，有的索性拆燒房屋。多少人家十年來沒添新裝，破爛的衣裳竟遮掩不了道德上認為羞恥的地方。有的全家只有一套像樣的衣服，誰外出儘誰先穿，其餘的就得躱縮在泥土坑上。</p>
<p>崇禮縣經共軍屠城洗刦後，遺留的孤兒寡婦幾個月來，每人僅領到一萬元的賑款，幾十斤白麵，他們不僅缺糧少穿，述柴水都發生恐慌！</p>
<p>新明縣是舊日的德化，日本投降後，某方的機械化兵住了四十多天，天天殺羊宰雞，臨走又將羊羣完全趕走，還拉去六千多頭牛，三多匹馬。緊接著共軍鬥爭淸算，在「剷高墊低」的政策下，最後只要穿皮襖戴毡帽的農民，都成了鬥爭的對象。</p>
<p>中共對他幹部這樣鼓勵：「社會越亂越好，人民愈怕愈好。」地痞流氓，是中共的得力幹部，人民的催命閻王。夜問好像進入地獄，人民把生命交給了這些「區狗子」「區腿子」（共軍幹部），隨時都會遭到殺身的禍害！親屬被害了！眼淚往肚裏流，恐怕聲張招來更多的災殃！</p>
<p>農村經濟，已走向生產停頓瀕臨破產的邊緣，春天來了，春耕期迫近，農胞縱有春耕熟情也沒有春耕條件。中共的土地政策和淸算鬥爭，製造了不少糾紛，雖然，在目前動盪不安人民還沒有保障的時候，誰亦不敢過早的提出解決，地主不敢過問被淸算的土地，怕共軍重來鬥爭，佃農們無力耕作且存心觀望，富農變窮，自耕農更是家徒四壁！共軍退却時、人民的車輛牛馬，都被裏走拉運物資，逃歸的不及半數；糧食吃光，籽種成了問題；農具被毀壞，或者已充做燃料，馬草飼料，更是山窮水盡，察北經過兩度洗刦，耕牛己蕩然無餘，赤手空拳，如何來耕作？即使歷盡辛苦收穫的糧食，不知又將落誰手？到頭來還免不掉挨飢受餓！慘痛的同憶，使人民不能不作惡劣的打算。農時誤了，這問題太的嚴重，但農民眼前前邊沒辦法生活，那顧計遙遠的將來？同前春耕的希望就只有寄托在政府的貸款與接濟之上。</p>
<p>物質生活雖然困苦萬分，人民還可做最低限度的忍受，精神上的驚懼惶恐，才是人民生命的威脅。在共軍出沒的地方，人民不敢說自己願說的話，不敢做自己願做的事，對共軍「敢恨不敢言」，對國軍想親近而又不敢明白表示，他們眞正失掉了「四大自由」。好像有一個可怕的陰影在跟隨自己，監視自己，隨時準備接受最不幸的遭遇！</p>
<p>今天，人民迫切需要的是生命安全保障，他們固然希望在自己的鄉鎮多駐此國軍，永遠的保護他們。但深恐國軍一旦離開，共軍會港土重來，再做俎上魚肉。所以呼求政府發給武器，武裝自衛。他們需要武器，比其他救濟物質更為殷切，寗可少吃少穿，亦願有武器握在自己手裏，保衛自己的生命。人民已不甘殘暴壓迫，他們在起來作有力的行動。</p>
<p>住在城市裏的人，還比較安定，但生活的重壓同樣使人喘不過氣來，共軍的破壞，使百分之九十的工廠都在休息，敵人九年的經營，共軍一夜中摧殘爭盡。時問，金錢，器材，安定同樣是復員的重要條件，擁有三萬工人的龍烟鐵礦現在只有幾十個人在看守斷壁頹垣和殘破機器！大批工人失業，救濟不過是杯水車薪，一述串的社會問題都在發生。公教人員的收入那裏趕得上物價飛跑。購買力的削弱，農村銷路滯塞，商業不振自在預料之中！若是邊防重鎭大軍雲集，柴炭住房，馬草馬料，無形中增加人民的負担，遇着紀律不好的部隊，更不知要受偌大委面煩擾。</p>
<p>這一幅慘苦的圖案，是察省人民生活的縮影，嚴酷的現實，正在鞭抽著人們，在災難恐戄的惡流這裏，人民如何活得下去？</p>
<p>（上）美麗的松花江村，許多別墅式的大廈，在此次共軍砲火下，悉已付諸刧灰。（下）德惠以北之碉堡。什九已被破壞，化為半壁頹垣。（本報特派員韓清濤寄）</p>

<h3>美國史學會內幕　第六十一次年會印象記</h3>
<p>— 黎東方</p>
<p>不久以前在華盛頓遇到美國語言獻館的館長布克先生（Solon　J．Buck），想不到過了幾天又在紐約遇到他是美國史學會的會計，到紐約來出席第六十一次年會。會期四天，由十二月廿七日至卅日。會塲是潘西凡尼亞大酒店。</p>
<p>堂皇富麗的大酒店中，擠滿了各方學者，這些學者多產是年逾花甲，鶴髮童顏。他們佔領了大跳舞廳（所好是不在別人跳舞的時間），又佔領了別人可以密談的小客廳若干間，哄哄然不像在研究學術，而像在辦什麼喜事，或作什麽外交酬酢。其中比較認眞的，還是年紀較輕的會員，他們對於前輩的無意談笑頗為注意，常常偸偸地記載下來。也有幾位似乎是記者又似乎是會員的Ladies，在那裹跑來跑去，手中拿了小簿子有聞必錄。沿着走廊，坐着一大排，各大書店的代表，似乎在比賽他們所出板的歷史書，當然利市十倍。其中以一家似書店非書店的「參考書服務社」Service　of　Bibliogarphy最為出色，他們所陳列的都是古本。他們除了賣絕板古書以外，還替人做抄書找材料的工作。</p>
<p>會期前一日的下午，理事會舉行一次會議。出席的除理事外有四位職員（Officers）即會長。副會長·會計·執行秘書兼會刊主編。理事會的構成辦法很好，我覺得中國史學會可以仿效。凡是做過會長的都是理事，此外設選任理事八人，任期四年，每年有兩人滿期，改選兩人。</p>
<p>現任的會長是哈佛大學的費雪尼先生（Sidney　B．Fay）副會長是普林斯有大學的福騰拜克先生（Thomas　J．Wertenbaker），而執行秘書是駐會的福德先生（Guy　Stanton　Ford）。在理事之中，有我國學人共知的夏庇羅先生（J．SalwynSchapiro）現在紐約市立大學敎書。</p>
<p>當會長的自然免不了一番開塲白，但是很客氣，把自已的正式講演排在第二天的晚上，題目是「進步的觀念」。為了強調歷史家的進步抱負，第一天的日程便從「自由與束縛」開始。主席是哥倫比亞大學的「西人」先生（W．L．Westernman），主講的共有三位，滿德生光生（Issac　Mendelcohn）講「古代近東之奴隸與農奴」，司蒂芬生先生（Carl　Stephenson）講「中古農奴之主要特色」；西弗德先生（W．G．Zeefeld）講「十六世紀之勞動與平等主義」。都很精彩，不愧為一年以來的心得。跟着每位講了以後，還有一位被指定作「討論」的，很有禮貌地略為提出幾點不難答覆的問題</p>
<p>可惜聽的人分身乏術，同一時間在其他的一一一個居間之中，還有侃侃而談的高論可聽。有人在講「俄羅斯的尋覓海口，」也有人在講「法國　次憲法」，還有人在講「地方史的新接觸」。可惜得很。</p>
<p>利用吃中飯的時間，司太爾先生（Hans　Staehle）被指定講「關於十九世紀初期普魯士經濟社會史之新發現」。新發現雖然不多，也頗能引起大家的興趣。我想，倘若所有的講演，都能廣描到各個大學，一定可以增加不少選習歷史的學生。</p>
<p>到了另一間餐廳，看見布克先生在作主席。有現任外交部職員的歷史家大談「國際公文及其保管」，又有聯合國的代理檔案室主任在報告他如何保管聯合國的檔案。</p>
<p>下午，繼續開會，繼續，繼續研究「自由與東縛」的問題，韋廉士先生（Eric　Williams）講「十九世紀帝國主義下之奴隸制度與契的勞動」；哈哩士先生（Herbert　Harris）講「今日世界對自由之限制一。哈里士先生對於各種程度的限制都不客氣。</p>
<p>在其他的三個房問之中，有人在研究「解放後之法國」，「中古後半期之英國」與「拉丁美洲」。誰能够分身？</p>
<p>晚上吃飯，又有兩個人講演。一人請「大憲章的觀念」，沒有什麼。另一人講「西進探險人的食肉問題」，頗為別緻，尤其是講在大家有肉可食的時候。</p>
<p>在第二天的許多講演之中，最呌我注意的自然是費兒班克先生（John　K．Fairbank）關於遠東史研究計劃的討論。他所報告的，是如何在哈佛大學指導研究生從事關於遠東史專門題目的探討。今日美國各大學之沒有遠東系的不多，而哈佛是其中的一個。在美國西南部落衫鐵附近的坡蒙那大學（Pomona　College）所藏有關遠東的書籍最富，芝加哥大學於已故勞佛先生（Laufer）的　劃之下，也有很好的基礎。辟次堡大學，（Pittsburg）與福爾蒙大學（Vermont創立逮東系不久，前途充滿希望。可惜三藩市大學與南加利福尼亞大學，雖也有遠東系而一則中斷，一則因主持之人離校而大為减色。至於哥倫比亞的中國系，有古得里支先生（Goodrich）領導，比起我國的若千最好的大學之中一國文學系，並無遜色。</p>
<p>第三天因為是星期日，上午休會，下午仍然有兩個人講演，討論法意二國的反教會運動。在上午做了禮拜，到下午來聽這個題目，自然不感乾燥。</p>
<p>第四天有二十四個人講演。他們的會，不像我們一般的會。也只有這樣的大講特講，才不愧為學術團體的年會。否則宴會一番，選舉一番，再閒話一番，有何學術可言？我們中國人過於老成，學問好的總是「深藏若虛」，不肯輕易示人並且面子觀念太重受不了別人的「討論」。其實學問是人類共有的產業，你的結論也未必是你的，還不是折衷他人的結論或證件而來？當別人駁倒或修正你的結論之時，你的貢獻已經「不朽」。劉邦固然有了天下，項羽也不愧為失敗的英雄。</p>
<p>壓戲軸是關於中學歷史課程及大學歷史課程之聯　問題。這個問題實在很重要。我們中國除了大學與中學之間以外，還有初中與高中之間的聯繫問題。我很盼望中國史學會於胡適之。顧頡剛。傅斯年·繆鳳林·沈剛伯五位常務理事的主持之下，能够多開幾次年會。人家的歷史才有二三百年却已經開了六十一次美國史學會年會了。</p>
<h3>具有藝術價值的特產　福州漆器今昔觀</h3>
<p>— 福州廿日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>福州特產的漆器已具有二百餘年之歷史，戰前馳銷於國內，南洋及歐美各地。到過福州的人，莫不同聲讚賞福州漆器的藝術價值。其繪畫之精，製配之巧，不禁嘆為觀止！上海尤為銷納福州漆器的一大市塲，幾乎一般家庭的陳設，倘有一套福州漆器的點綴，便顯得滿壁生輝。</p>
<p>一頁小史為國爭光</p>
<p>遠在遜清中葉，榕人沈紹安於習藝之際發現脫胎漆器之製法，後來乃開始製造輕便用具，如碗，盒子等，為當時一般人土所賞識。傳說留榕西橋初向沈氏訂製洗手碗若干具裝船返國，船次半途傾覆，而此漆器固質輕仍浮留海面，為另一海船水手所拾，携歸美國，互相傳閱，是為福州漆器行銷海外之噹矢。清季，南洋舉行勸業會，沈民携其精製漆器參加展覽，得有榮譽獎章，淸政府亦以商勳及四品頂戴頒予沈氏，表示獎進藝術之意。嗣後民國四年工商部頒發商業獎狀，民十年參加巴拿馬賽會，民國十七年參加上海全國工商展覽會皆獲有榮譽獎狀。民國十九年美國芝加哥舉行尤國博覽會，沈氏漆器被譽為無上之藝術作品，榮獲一等飛鷹獎章，福州漆器信可稱為世界漆業中之翹楚，為國家增光下少。</p>
<p>製造技巧　維妙維肖</p>
<p>福建不產漆，而福州漆器特著。我國漆樹以雲貴及四川為多，福州製造漆器之用漆，乃販運川漆，捨漆而外，另須木料以舊楠木因質固為宜，綢布以及金銀粉，珊瑚紅等色素。製造方法可分為三種：</p>
<p>（一）脫胎—先用泥塑成模型，以薄綢裱之，用調麵粉之漆液塗上，底留一孔，俟乾後以細磚塊磨之使光，如是一漆一磨，經廿餘次歷時八個月，迨漆模牢固後，浸八永中，水從底孔入，泥型盡脫，以針挖之使出，泥去坯存，重行刮垢，磨光之後敷以金粉，調色彩，精彩奪目。輕而耐久，雖歷數百年而不變色，此謂精製</p>
<p>（二）半脫胎—用舊楠木雕成模型，以薄綢裱之，塗漆十五次，歷時半年可成，質較重。</p>
<p>（三）木質—用舊楠木雕成模型，以自行永嘉配之退光漆塗上，調漆十次，需時四個月，質尤重，此種漆器黃歷久不變。　另有雜牌漆店以豬血代漆製成漆器，六個月內即可變色此非眞正福州之漆器。</p>
<p>漆器之種類大部屬裝飾品，尤以花瓶及烟盒，餅盒等為主，次如人物（包括神像）之雕塑，描繪山水花卉，維肖維妙。其製造之技巧，匠心獨運。首貴精銳之目力與沉靜之構思及輕細之手法，南國和煦之氣候，亦為製漆之有利條件，當中秘訣尚多，製造者似不便一一言傳。</p>
<p>漆業廿家　一系傳授</p>
<p>沈福安為福州漆器業的鼻祖，一般人也認為沈氏的漆器技巧最精。除了沈福安老牌一家外，福州現尚有大大小小漆器店的二十家，技工及工作人員約有三百人。上等技術人員約有五十餘人，據說都是沈氏一系相傳授的。　製漆器的工塲組織，在技術方面，計分六科：</p>
<p>（一）木科—司雕刻模型。（二）泥科—司塑製模型。（三）漆科—司調漆上漆。（四）畫科—司繪畫。（五）雕刻科—司漆面之雕製。（六）配色科—司金，銀，珊瑚紅各種色素之調配。</p>
<p>此種技工須習藝五年以上，始能着手製造。目下技工每日工作八小時，工資從一萬元至一萬五千元不等。</p>
<p>抗戰前，他們營業旺暢，盛極一時。戰後，由於一般人購買力薄弱，運輸之不便及原料來源之不易等，已經逐漸沒落了。據云去年全年行銷於京滬一帶的漆器不及一億元，福州市而營業更門可羅雀，一般人生活艱苦異常，那有閒情逸致來欣賞藝術品。　不過，漆器的製造仍然有其藝術的價值與經濟的價值，具有二百餘年歷史馳譽海內外的福州漆器業，豈忍令其日漸衰落，假使政府能够予以生產貸款，或以官商合作的方式界以資金上之支持維持其往昔的繁榮，爭取南洋及歐美的國際市場，未始不是一個獲取外匯的路綫。</p>

<h3>眞理上帝知道，但要等待</h3>
<p>— 托爾斯泰著·田仲濟譯</p>
<p>在維拉蒂米鎭上住着一個年輕的名叫伊凡·搭米垂·愛克司諾夫的商人。他有兩爿商店和一座住宅。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫是一個美麗的，有黃色美好的捲髮的靑年，很詼諧並且喜歡音樂，當他年輕的時候很好飲酒，有時醉了還發酒瘋；但從結婚後除了間或飲一點外便絕不沾唇了。</p>
<p>一個夏天，愛克司諾夫預備到尼納市去，他和家人告別的時候，他的妻對他說，「伊凡·搭米垂，今天不要起身，我做了一個不好的夢。」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫大笑着說，「你是怕我那樣呵，你是怕我到了市上又要狂飲了。」</p>
<p>他的妻回答說，「我也不明白我怕甚麼，我只知道我做了一個不好的夢，我夢着你從市上回來，當你脫去你的帽子時，我看見你的頭髮全是灰白了。」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫大笑了，一那是一個吉兆」，他說，「試看我會不會賣了所有的貨物，並且從市上帶一些禮物來給你罷。」</p>
<p>這樣他便離開他的家庭起身了。</p>
<p>在半道中他遇上了一個熟識的商人，夜問他們宿在了一個旅館喪。他們在一塊喝了一會茶就到了兩個緊連着的房間內睡去了。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫不喜歡晏起，又因為他想趁着凉快的時候趕路，在天還沒有明的時節便喚醒了僕人，駕上車。</p>
<p>到店主人那裏（他住在後面的一個院落內）會了鈔，便又繼續着趕路</p>
<p>走了約有二十五英里，停下來喂馬，愛克司諾夫在旅館的走廊裏歇了一會，便去用銅壺煮上茶，取出六絃琴來彈奏。</p>
<p>忽然叮噹的響着鈴聲的一輛馬車趕來了，一個警官跳了下來，後面隨着兩個警察。他走到愛克司諾夫面前盤問，問他是誰，從什麽地方來。愛克司諾夫全回答了他，並客氣的說，「你不在這裏喝一杯麽？」但是那警官還繼續的盤問他，「昨夜你在甚麼地方住的宿？是你自己還是有同伴的商人？今早晨你曾看見那個人麽？你為甚麼在黎明以前就離開那旅館呢？」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫很奇怪他為什麼被盤問這些事情，但他全述說了他的經過，並添上一句說，「你為什麽這樣盤問我，好像以為我是一個小倫或強盜呢？我是一個經商的人，沒有盛請我的必要。」</p>
<p>警宮喊過警察來，又說，「我是這鎭上警察署的警官，我盤問你的緣故，是因今早上發見了昨夜同你一塊住宿的商人被創斷咽喉死去了。我們必須檢查你的東西。」</p>
<p>他們到屋裏去，警察和警官解開了愛克司諾夫的行李檢查。忽然那警官從一隻口袋裏取出了一把刀子來，大聲吆喝着說，「這是誰的刀子呢？」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫看時，一把血汚的刀子從他的口袋裏取出，他受驚而愕然了。</p>
<p>「這刀子怎麽會有血呢？」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫想要同答，但是一個字也說不出來，只口吃的說：「我——不知道——不是我的。」</p>
<p>警官說，「今早晨　見那個商人被割斷咽喉死在床上，你是僅有的能作這事的人。屋門從裏面關着，沒有其餘任何人在那裏·這血跡的刀子在你的口袋裏，並且你的臉色和態度也將你的密秘泄漏了！告訴我，你是怎樣殺的他，並且偸了多少錢？」</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫發誓也沒有做這事，從一塊喝茶後他便沒再看見那商人了；除了他自己的八千盧布外他也沒有別的餞，並且這刀子也不是他的。但是他說話口吃，面色漆白，　　　　像　是犯了罪是的。</p>
<p>警官吩咐警察綁起愛克司諾夫來把他放在囚車上，他們緊綑起了他的雙足將他放進了車中，愛克司諾夫自己畫了十字在那裏哭。他的錢和貨物都被沒收了，他被送到一個附近鎭上囚禁起來。調查他先前在維拉蒂米的品行，那鎭上的商人和居民說，以前的時候他常常喝酒並遊手好閒，但却是一個好人。審判了，他被判為殺了一個商人和刦了兩尤盧布的罪。</p>
<p>他的妻很失望，知不道是信還是不信的好，她所有的小孩都還很小；一個幼小的還在襁褓中。她乃帶了全體的孩子到她丈夫被監禁的那個鎭上去。最初還不允許她去看他，經過長久的懇求，獄官允許了她，她被帶到他那裏。當她看見她的丈夫穿着囚服，鎖着鐵鍊，和一些盜賊，罪人監在一處時，她暈到了，很久的時間她失了知覺。待了一會她才領着小孩，靠近他坐下。告訴了他一些家中的事情，問他所遭遇的事情的經過，他全告訴她。她又問，「我們現在怎樣作呢？」</p>
<p>「我們必須請求沙皇，不要使一個無事的人滅亡。」</p>
<p>他的妻告訴他，她已請求過沙皇了，但沒有得到允許。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫沒有回答，只垂頭喪氣的。</p>
<p>他的妻說，「那不是沒有原因的，我夢着你的頭髮變灰白了，你還記得麽？那一天你不應該起程。」她又伸手撫弄着他的頭髮說，「親愛的，告訴你的妻實話，那不是你做的麼？」</p>
<p>「你也，這樣懷疑我！」愛克司諾夫說着將臉埋在兩手中啜泣了。接着一個獄卒進來說，女人和孩子們必須出去了，就是這樣地他最後離別了他的家裏的人們。</p>
<p>他們去了後，愛克司諾夫回憶剛才的談話，當他想到連他妻子也懷疑他時，他自語說，好像只有上帝知道眞情，也僅必須對億懇求，僅有從他可以得到憐恤</p>
<p>於是愛克司諾夫不寫懇請書了，什麼也不希望了，只是對上帝祈禱。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫被判決笞撲並送到壙中做苦工。他被鞭打，傷好了後，便被和其他的囚犯一同送到了西伯利亞。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫在西伯利亞過了二十六年的囚徒生活。他的頭髮變得雪白了，他的鬚鬚也長了，濃了，灰白色了，他的愉快盡消失了；他駝着背；走路很慢，說話的聲音細弱，永遠失去了笑容，但却常常禱告。</p>
<p>在監獄裏邊愛克司諾夫學着做靴子，賺的錢他買了一本使徒行傳，當監獄裏的光綫充足時他便讀這本書。禮拜日他就在監獄的禮拜堂裏讀新約使徒行傳，在詠詩班裏唱詩，因為他的嗓子仍然很好。　因為愛克司諾夫的溫順獄官很喜歡他監獄中的同伙們都尊敬他，他們尊稱他為「老爹」或「聖徒」。若他們想對獄官有什麽要求時，常常推舉愛克司諾夫為代表，就是他們中間發生什麽爭執，也是找他來判斷是非，分辨曲直。</p>
<p>愛克司諾夫，從未接到過家中的消息，他的妻和小孩們是否還活廣他也無從知道。</p>
<p>一天，一隊新的因犯來到監獄裏，晚間的時候，舊囚犯都集攏了來圍繞着，問他們從什麼地方來，判決的什麽罪。愛克司諾夫也在這些人中靠近新來的人們坐着，聽到他們的話他沮喪了起來。</p>
<p>一個新來的囚犯，是一個六十歲的高大強壯的人，長着濃密的剪短的灰白的鬍子，正在對人們告訴他被捕的原因。</p>
<p>「好了，朋友們，」他說，「我僅僅牽了人家套在撬車上的一匹馬，就被拘捕而誣我為盜。我說我僅是牽牠來為的是快一點到家，並馬上就放牠回來，並且那車主還是我的一個朋友，所以我說，「其實不過是這末一回事罷了」「不對，」他們却說，「你是偷的」但是我怎樣愉的和在什麼地方偷的，他們又說不出來。有一决我確乎作了一點罪過的事情，按情理說我早就該到這裘來了，但那時我未被發覺，現在却無辜的被送到這裏來……嚘，可是我說的還不對，以前我曾到過西伯利亞，不過住了不久罷了</p>
<h3>母與子（木刻）</h3>
<p>— 吳俊發</p>
<h3>我的發牢騷</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>在從前，我是最會發牢匬的人。所以會這樣，當然有着好像不得不然的原因：第一，我是「生不逢辰」，家喪貧苦非凡；第二，在學校裏讀書，成績居然總比別人好些，很自負；第三，我的感情易於衝動；第四，偏偏我又喜歡文學。道些都是內在的原因，就是從我自己方面發出來的原因。本來這些原因也不見得一定便會成為發牢騷的原動力，要是沒有外來的原因在磨擦着。可是外來的原因却不息地發揮着牠們的威力，於是我一蹶不振，只好走上了盡是發牢騷的生活之路。</p>
<p>外來的原因是什麽呢？第一是勢利，勢利看不起窮孩子；第二，社會上所需要的，根本不是學校裏所需要的，學校裏的劣等生，往往是社會上的大亨，而優等生，尤其有一些操守不肯屈服或遷就的，就只有到處碰壁；第三，社會上所需要的是胸有成竹，不露聲色，愈假愈好；第四，文學沒有出路，或者說，在現在的中國沒有出路。這些外來的，正像一個大熔爐，將我燒，燒得我幾乎無地自存，我只好發牢騷，自附於文人之列，和古今其他的文人一樣，聊以自解。</p>
<p>於是我嘆。一看見知己的老朋友，就好像迷途的孩子看見了母親那樣，一連串地訴苦。有些老朋友，的確還有舊感情，總安慰着我，有力量的，也帮着設法將我的狀况改善些。可是這樣的老朋友很少，很少，少得眞成鳳毛麟角。大多數的老朋友呢？比較和氣些的，不發一言，皺着眉，低着頭，盡他傾聽的義務，等到我訴說得差不多了，才淡淡地敷衍幾句；要是沒有耐性而早就忘了朋友之誼的，不是責怪我的不善處世，便是「王願左右而言他」，不要聽；我再嚕囌下去，他就會「我還有一些事，我們改日再談吧」，以此結束我的牢騷。還好，我只嘆在老朋友面前，要是在新朋友面前，我不知要被弄到怎樣不堪的地步呢！</p>
<p>自然我也　。我罵貪官汚吏；我驚市懀奸商，我罵忘恩負義之徒，我罵寡康鮮恥之輩；我罵放蕩的人；我罵迂拘的人；我罵任何不良的人；我罵舊習慣，惡勢力；我罵帝國主養，封建制度；我罵任何害人的壞事。我不擇地而罵，不搖時而罵，更不擇人，擇與我同情的人，而罵。罵得痛快，也就是牢騷發得痛快。</p>
<p>還好，我發牢騷沒有到瘋的地步，因此不會動于打人，也不會歌哭無端。這也許得力於我生活的正常，絕對無嗜好，所以我還能把握我心腦的平衡。然而我掙扎着，撐拒着，眞是一此皮的牢騷不平之氣，總是發不完，苦極苦極！</p>
<p>我不能不感謝對日的抗戰，牠才救我脫離了牢騷的網羅，從此不再發。抗戰一發生，我就覺得，什麽個人的事情，都應該一概丟之腦後：否則，沒有了自己的國，也沒有了自己的社會，自己的家，那還有什麽自己的個人呢！並且危險就像大刀懸在頭上，天天有橫死的可能，還要發什麽牢騷！八年的抗戰，我這個感覺愈來愈淸楚，就變成了一種更生的力量，不再為牢騷所陷。</p>
<p>由於抗戰，看見了種種變化，又確定從前年輕時在學校裏，在教堂裏所受的教訓是眞的：只有忘了自己為別人，才是眞快樂！</p>
<p>現在，環境並沒有好，我所這受的，也不見得比了抗戰前容易忍受到多少。但我已不再發牢騷了，就為了我已知道努力忘記自己，而為別人効勞。</p>
<p>可憐的文人，要浚並且會發牢騷的文人，一定很多吧，你們以為我的話怎樣？我不想自誇，本來也沒有什麽可誇，我只想對你們作一些貢獻，請你們不要發牢騷。</p>
<h3>新人的推薦—一次文藝工作的報告</h3>
<p>— 范泉</p>
<p>「文藝春秋」四卷三期（下月十五日出版）發動了一個「推薦新人問題筆談會」，結果參加的作家有十七位之多，尤其使我們感激的，是那些外埠的作家，例如漢口的端木藝良，香港的林煥平，成都的SY　，四川萬縣的田濤，吳興南潯的徐遲，廣州的鍾敬文，他們都從遙遠的外埠，寫了稿子，用快信寄遞給我們，這種為培植文藝新人而不辭繁累的工作，眞使我們在陸續接到了稿件的時候感到無上的高興。</p>
<p>關於這次推薦新人問題的筆談會，事先我們向各作家發出了信件，信件的原文是這樣的——×××先生</p>
<p>如果文藝的園地相同於果樹的園地，那末花果的收穫是需夢圍丁的不斷栽培。自從五四運動以來，中國新文藝的生命已有數十年的歷史，在這並不冗長，但也不算太短的時期裏，一批批作家的浮沉，使我們獲得一個寶貴的教訓：為了培植文藝的園地，為了創造美麗的花果，僅僅依賴老園丁們的努力是不够的，我們顯然需要新的園丁們的合作，需要灌溉新的血液，需要充實新的力量。本刊自從出版以來，對於新人的發掘工作素未忽視，不過平時因為限於篇幅，未能充分容納，現在決定於四卷三期內，全部發表新人的作品，嘗試一决大規模的介紹。而在這「新人推薦號」編印以前，謹向先生徵詢關於發掘新人問題的意見八項，以便編刊，而供讀者和作者的研討。素仰先生熱心於中國新文藝的栽培，尤致力於新作者的推薦和介紹，用敢馳書徵求，乞於二月二十日前賜予答覆後擲交本市福州路三八〇號本社，下勝感激。耑懇。敬頌著安文藝春秋月刊社敬啓在上述的信件後面，附刊了以下八個問題——</p>
<p>（一）誌和文藝副刊的編者，對於新人的作品（不論優秀的作。或未成熟的作品）應當用怎樣的態度去處理它。</p>
<p>（二）過去，就先生個人的編輯經騐說對於外來的稿件，在閱讀和介紹工作上感覺到怎樣的困難？用怎樣的方法才能解除這些困難？</p>
<p>（三）發掘和培養新人的工作，在文藝的成長過程裏何以是非常必要？根據怎樣的文藝理論來解釋這個原理？</p>
<p>（四）一般地說，理想的介紹工作，是在發表新人作品的同時，附帶刊載老作家們的讀後意見，但是這樣的辦法，對於作品本身的理解是不是會有某種程度上的限制？對於作者是不是眞正裨益？是不是再有其他更好更有效的推薦方法？</p>
<p>（五）由於目前的純文藝期刊副刊的數量的稀少，要容納大量的新人作品是非常困難。這種困難用怎樣的方法去解除它？</p>
<p>（六）如果由主要的幾個期刊副刊的編者，聯合而組織一個專事介紹新人作品的通訊機構，在各位老作家的支持下，把水準以上的作品，送請老作家閱讀，並在寫述閱讀意見後再分別送發各報章雜誌發表，或甚至出「聯合刊」，或由本社單獨發行「特刊」——這樣的組織機構是否合適？有何困難？是吾再有其他更好的辦法？</p>
<p>（七）要是上述的機構有迫切存在的必要，那本社願意首先發動組識這樣的機構。但不知先生願意擔任批閱的工作吾？如果願意，則希望閱讀哪一部門的作品？每個月可以閱讀幾篇（多少字數）？</p>
<p>（八）發掘新人的具體方案能够實現時，我們準備把新人作品的百分三十至四十的稿酬贈與閱讀批改者，這樣的辦法是否妥善？酬金是否太高或太低？作家們獲得了上開的信件以後，於是都陸續寄下稿件，除了羅洪先生來信自謙不能回答，和福州王西彥先生的來稱過遲無法刊出外，本市的作家刋出約有：孔另境，吳天，林淡秋，施　存，徐調手，郭紹處，許傑，新以，趙景深，劉北氾，適夷義先生。其中葉聖陶先生的一篇，是在的稿的時候就已說定要把它獨立起來的，所以葉先生的一篇，寫成文章的形式，題目是「一篇像樣的作品」。</p>
<p>綜合上列十多位作家的意見，雖然略有參差，但却可以歸納到以下幾個原則：（一）對於新人的推薦和培義，他們都有偉大的熱忱；（二）希望能够組織一種專事培養新人的通訊機構，使新人們的作品有大量的出路；（三）必要的時候，他們都願意來閱讀新人的作品。</p>
<p>現在我們正和幾個有關係的朋友設法組織一個「文藝通訊社」，不但要介紹新人的作品，也還兼行介紹老大的作品到遙遠的外埠去。我們希望我們的努力將特別裨益於新進的作家們。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血188</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>僅僅只有耀羣和小虎城預備上東交民巷窺伺萍子，（這是假定的目襟），這一着確有些危險，因為我們對於對方，一切都沒有報告，不知虛實。兵法說「知己知彼，百戰百勝，」這裏我們缺少了一個「知彼」的條件，安能不算危險？說得嚴格些，這是一種「輕舉妄動」了；縱令不闖大禍，怕也難免小小的失敗。</p>
<p>耀羣的探險，難道不是一種「知彼」的光頭行動？旣要「知彼」，必得有人先去探索，不是嗎？這却不然，探索的工作，自有探索的人去作，也自有計劃步驟，却不能讓耀羣去作。照我們的方式，一定是光派小綫去活動。小綫雖不算重要人物，他們的工作也不算主要，然而他們是觸　，沒有觸　的詳細報告，如要行動，那就是盲進了，特務工作，並不能盲進；盲進就是危險。</p>
<p>這們一說，就知道鶴見認為危險，乃是害怕這座秘密機關內，恐有敵方混入，而主持的人還矇在鼓裏。</p>
<p>鶴見說出了危險兩字之後，我很注意戴先生w君和那位經理的神色。這時我只看見戴先生有意無意之問，看了w君一眼，眼光中表現了一個很淸楚的「？」符號。而w君却很敏捷地把這符號用眼神傳遞到那位經理頭上。這個傳遞的眼神剛一觸到那位經理，却早已同時在那位經理的表情上得到了答案。這個表情僅僅是微微搖頭，—一種強度的自信，表示鶴見所謂危險，有些過慮；這裏並無敵方特工滲入。</p>
<p>「老兄有什麼發見嗎？」w君得了經理的自信力表示之後，這麽問着鶴見。</p>
<p>「似乎有一點…」鶴見離座，慢騰騰地踱到窗口，回轉身來，把背靠在牆上，吸引了屋子的視綫，「我回到這裹，剛要到家的時候，有一部很華麗的車子走在我前面，距離大的五十碼光景，在我們這大門口停下，車子裏下來了一個女子，一晃眼間，三脚兩步，進了這裏的大門。等我的車子趕到門口，那部車子早開到三四十碼以外了，連號碼都無法看淸楚」。</p>
<p>「那個女子是不是高高的個兒，很嬝條約身「裁？」耀衆似有所見的問着。</p>
<p>「模樣，行動，很有些像我在日本認識的一個人！」鶴見好像沒有聽見耀羣的話，只把眼睛注視在自己脚前的地板上，深思沉想着，看樣子是在追憶已往的一個片段，想了一會，忽又抬起頭來，瞧着耀羣，出神了一會，好像才把自己的追憶剪斷，理會到耀羣的問話：</p>
<p>「是的，耀小姐，…嬝條倒是嬝條，可是個兒並不太高」，鶴見答覆了耀羣，重又瞧着我們，「等我下車，趕到大廳裹，連牠的人影都沒有了。我不便去驚動大廳的職事，也不便打聽開升降機的…」。</p>
<p>我聽到這裏，心下有些知覺了。鶴見說這人是他在日本認識的，我猜這人十分之十是萍子；想必她已追踪着鶴見來了。</p>
<p>「大概這位小姐進來了十幾分鐘？」那位經理，把手册展開了。</p>
<p>鶴見瞧着自己的手錶，點了點頭。</p>
<p>「高麗女子」，經理讀着小册上的記載：「約二十四五歲，姓李，名呌金子，與韓人「　國大同盟」有關係」，讀到這裹，又抬起頭來，看了w君一眼，似乎得到w君的同意，才轉向觀見，「我們這裏第三樓，住着一位高麗「大同盟」的幹部，柳平先生。他因為一次激烈行動，不幸把自己的一雙眼虧燬了……很可惜的」！</p>
<h3>山居草　—風雪散抄</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>一·野谷</p>
<p>好陰冷的黑暗的山谷呀！</p>
<p>我是一個童稚的牧羊人，每天，我嗅着山野間腐草的嗅味，趁着滿天朝霞出門，到黃昏人稀的時候，我又吹奏着生命的收笛，經着羊羣歸來。</p>
<p>我深愛着這種速綿的冬天的野谷呀……雖然，身上有點寒冷，但，原野上一片銀白色，你說多麼皎潔，多發莊嚴的白色呵！</p>
<p>我深愛着這連綿的冬天的野谷呀，因為這兒的泥壤，哺養我長大的。</p>
<p>我冀求，什麽時候野谷襄才開滿微笑的花來。我冀求什麽時候野谷裏才有爽朗的歌聲……</p>
<p>二·雕樓</p>
<p>佇立在荒山間，孤零零的像一個衷老的襤褸的老人之雕棋呵</p>
<p>野草是你綠色的翠裙，白雲是你華麗的車蓋，花朶是你的裝飾：</p>
<p>我站在黃昏裏的雕樓邊，漫長的　想。遙念着昔年馳騐的疆塲上的英雄們。</p>
<p>向遠方，我播唱出對騎士們的讚美詩。</p>
<p>三·土屋</p>
<p>小土屋被風雪，當雨冲激着，揮打着……</p>
<p>我住在小土屋裏有滿腔的眼淚與苦難，我懷念着開花的日子。</p>
<p>但，我仍愛着這生活的避風港，我永遠捨不得雖開親愛的小土　呵！</p>
<h3>春夢一塲自費生</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>央年七月的時候政府舉辦公。自費生留學考試，許多人屬兵秣馬，滿想一帆風順，金榜掛名，也好到外國去蹓跶一番。再回到祖國來，好顯一顯身手。</p>
<p>那時候美金的匯率，是二〇二〇元。照很多人的算法，即使公費生考不上，自費到美國去唸書，預備唸二年吧，苦吃苦熬的三千元美金，也勉強可支持了，也就是說，駁多準備了六百萬元的錢，也就可以留學了。這想法當然是不錯的，有錢的人當然一切都不用打算，但是，苦讀書的人却非打算不行呢。</p>
<p>好容易辦了一大堆檢查體格報名的手續，也好容易經過了考試，這張「金榜」却是姍姍來遲、直等到美金匯率調整至三三五〇元以後的十月底，方才發表。公費生們當然滿心等出國，自費生們却已經憑空添上了一半以上的費用，預備留學的人們，並不是個個家裏存儲着多少美鈔的人們呢，他們很多正在辛勤的積儲着工作的薪酬，現在，他們要留學，至少得準備一千萬元的國幣了。</p>
<p>名字是上了金榜了，但是公費生自費生都還是一直耽在國裏。自費生們，政府要他們先繳出外國學校的大學證，再發護照，他們恍如孤孩般誰也不加照拂，當然一時都繳不出大學證，也就出不了國門。公費生呢，大概是政府的公忙吧，好像他們旣沾了政府的光，浪費些時間也是應該的，直到最近政府才來了一張下月在南京集訓的通知，至於什麽時候出國，進什麽學校，那還是天知道</p>
<p>但是，外匯率却又巳調整至一二〇〇〇元了。除了美國難財勝利財的奸商等等的子女，誰再能有這麼偌大的款子去留學？自費生去中央銀行請願，沒有下文，去教育部請願，沒有下文。</p>
<p>外交部的下文却來了：「奉令，所有公自費留學生之出國護照，一律暫時停發」。輕描淡寫，一筆勾銷了。</p>
<p>半年了，一切都成了泡影，旣然政府不要什麽留學，又何必教這麼多人曠　時日來空等空待，難道眞的把學生們作為點綴門面的犧牲品麽？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「學以致用」</h3>
<p>— 高武弘</p>
<p>准漢奸以譯著代作業論</p>
<p>學問和人格，道德，是絕對不同的二件事。猶如許多人的言行不能一致一樣，學問深邃的人，他的人格和道德，往往適得其反，人格高尚道德可風的長者，他的學問，却未必見得一定好。以學問去度這個人的人格道德，或以這個人的人格道德去度他的學問，都會使你失望。學問，人格，和道德，決不能以同樣的砝碼放在一個天平上量衡，雖然也有例外，但這例外少得眞如鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>從古以來，失節叛國，賣國求榮的奸逆，十九都有很好的學問，「唯聰明人，才會犯大過失，大罪惡。」他們的所作所為，正是辜負了滿肚子才學。漢奸中，也不乏才富學豐之徒，如周作人，周佛海，梁鴻志輩，正有不少人替他們惋惜，但是他們所犯的罪惡，傾西江之水也難洗滌，這也是「學非所用」的結果，學問和人格道德不能相提並論的一個確證。</p>
<p>報載：本市高院看守所內　押的漢奸人犯，內中頗多曾受高等教育及熟諳外國語文者，院方現已在監內另關塲所，准許彼等以譯著替代其他作業，按所有人犯的學歷擅長，分別配以撰稿，繼譯，校對等工作。</p>
<p>漢奸們昔日以用非所學而「一失足成千古恨」，做了一塲大夢，夢醒之後，身入囹圄，「閉監思過」之餘，想想自己的一身才學，就此拋却有些可惜，於是便想假監中歲月一展所長，竟邀當局恩准，從此可以無顧無慮，專心一致，在監內為他們特關的塲所內，埋首案頭，潛心寫作，以排遺修悠的牢獄生活了。</p>
<p>在那樣的環境裏，從事譯著等工作，為漢奸們設身處地的想一想，此情此景，眞有些難堪。如果早一些能够善用其學，好自為之，則何至於有今日！</p>
<p>身　縲絏的漢奸，正在幹着「學以致用」的工作，使社會上無數「用非其學」的人聞之，不知作何感想，是慙恧？還是警惕？</p>
<p>「文窮而後工」，漢奸在監牢裹面「用功」寫文章，不知應該怎樣說法？</p>
<h3>思佳客——寫在「死無葬身之地」新聞後</h3>
<p>— 哀窮鬼們</p>
<p>生也可悲死可憐，生無居處死無棺；更　無地能埋骨，翻美當年入土安</p>
<p>遲火葬，豈空懸？誰知勝利死生難？大事階級眉頭皺：奧氣該防六月天</p>
<p>註：一棺代價，決非窮家能買。「入土為安」，是空襲時入防空壕的戲言，有人戲對「見機而作。」</p>
<h3>無法生存</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>斗室之中，住着陳周李三個人，陳是留學生，周李二人都是大學生，一個在稅局服務，一個做新聞記者，一個做大學教授。日間各在外間工作，一到晚上八九點鐘，為了睡眠的關係，不的而同的集合在一起，除了看書閱報之外，就開始「淸談」的</p>
<p>淸談的目標無一定，黃金案，貪汚案，梁仁達案，魯南大會戰，傅斯年大放砲，生活指數凍結，日用必需品漲價，王雲五談推行政策不問結果，蘇聯讓美代管日太平洋島嶼，國外時事，國內新聞，家庭經濟，個人生活，無所不談，談的內容包含着政治，經濟，法律，文化，社會，科學。　的時候，除三個人以外，沒有第四個人在旁，信口開河，縱論天下，頗合憲法上的「言論自由」，民主國家的「民主」原則。</p>
<p>三人的月薪都在四五十萬元，周君還沒有結婚，但是要負擔未婚妻的讀書費，結婚的儀式，無論如何簡單，總須要一筆開辦費；婚後妻子若是生了一二個孩子，無人照料，要用女僕，那個開支龐大，在這生活程度日漲夜大的今日，祗好望洋興嘆，喊着「無法結婚」。李君家屬不在滬濱，吃「客飯」的開支浩大，加以人情應酬，呌着「無法維持」。陳君有父母妻和子女共七人的負擔，衣食住行，集中一身，窮苦奮鬥，說：「做事不滿意的時候，可以辭職，獨有一個「戶長」無法辭掉，妻子下能出賣，兒女下能解聘，硬着頭皮典質渡日，嘆着「無法生存」。</p>
<p>淸談的結果，以不了了之。秀才造反，人家不怕；自殺沒有勇氣。大家都嘆着「無法生存」。</p>
<h3>「泰山」老了</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>在大上海開映的「泰山沙漠大捷」，是許多東西拚凑起來的一個雜碎。它有納粹問諜，有怪獸，有一點兒的游泳和　繩索，如此而連成一個故事，自然令人有陳腐之感。泰山年齡雖並沒有大了幾歲，然而泰山片的精神却己經老了。在吸引觀衆的力量說，它已經成了強弩之末，因為它在各方面都沒有進步可言，有之恐怕祇是小猩猩契塔會在繼索上翻跟斗而己。</p>
<p>女角南養凱萊，在伴小泰山禱告以及其他幾處聽說泰山有嬌要在美國的時候，表情尚有可取之處。其他很勉強，泰山本身自然更談不到演戲，他祗是一個大力士罷了。</p>

<h3>因難見巧—聯語新話之六</h3>
<p>— 聽松</p>
<p>輔仁大學一教授，狂士也。生平好大言，下筆洋洋灑灑，恒謂天下無難題，一日，有女生懇製一聯，某大笑曰：「無此體例，蓋女生所話乃欲以小姨挽姊夫也。」同坐者議之曰：兄今日有難題矣。某奮然曰：何難之有？惟必須有事實耳。女生曰：「乃父與姊夫同為輔仁大學教授意氣相得，乃重之以婚姻，壻依翁而居，事變後，翁留校而壻失業，生活日漲，旣年高，翁家累亦重，每謂人曰：我豢嫁出之女與外孫，已為例外，更養失業之壻，則力不能矣。壻聞之，憤而出走後方，於廣西省立大學得一席，去冬往而今秋殂，且姊嫁後生二雛，一男一女，事實如此，能運用乎？某即振筆一揮，而成一聯曰：「逝者長巳矣，痛吾姊茹苦含辛，尚累白頭老父；人生若　耳，恨弱質心優力絀，難助黃口孤兒。」並告女生曰：小姨與姊夫，如叔嫂之不通問，故無相挽體例，若以唁姊為生義，則挽其夫，即不難矣。一座甚為欽服。乃越曰，而女生又偕其仲姊至，請再作一聯，蓋女生姊妹三人，賦悼亡者。伯姊也。某以事實已用盡，不能再作却之，女生姊妹，堅請不已，且曰：姊夫死於廣西，前聯求之及也。某不假思索，又製一聯，其詞曰：「數千里噩耗飛來，痛吾姊鵠寡鸞孤，無限悲凉塡妹臆，一百年光陰易逝，願兩甥蚊騰鳳起，早能成立慰親心。」前聯用成語，甚超妙。此聯對唁姊更極沈摯，而鵠鸞蛟鳳，姊臆親心，對仗允工號，可謂信手拈來，都成妙諦。余則謂兩聯均渾成大方，實在不易，固屬因難見巧，而其事則又甚趣，至今思之，猶忍俊不禁也。</p>
<h3>多金何益——讀史偶感</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>偶讀明史，當甲申之變時，「一按籍勳戚大壋，徵其助餉。遣太　徐高，論嘉定伯周奎為倡，奎謝無有，高泣諭再三，奎漫詞以對。高拂然起曰：外戚如此，國事去矣！多金無益耶：」「太監王之心最富，上面諭之，僅獻萬金。諸內官各大書於門曰：此房急賣。一</p>
<p>我們看：身為皇親國戚，內侍近臣，當國事危急到一髮千鈞的時候，竟不明「國亡家不保」的道理，只顧狗啃肉骨似的死守着金錢，不肯拿點出來補助軍餉，匡救國家；非但不肯，而且還要裝腔作勢，借「此房急賣」來作裝窮作苦的幌子。這班人，利令智昏，喪心病在，實在令人又恨又氣，而又好笑。</p>
<p>因此，又使我想起一般愛錢如命的守財奴，他們把過剩的錢，儲藏在倉庫襄呌它坐「冷宮」，不肯對國計民生，做一點福利事業。這樣，那些錢是你不是你，又有什麼不同呢？那些錢對你又有什麼關係呢？徒然埋沒了它約有用之村，甚至禍國殃民而已</p>
<p>如果說守財奴的貪得無厭，無非要有美滿的生活，教富的事受。那末，有許多財產多得已經不可勝計的人，即使窮奢極侈，長命千年，也已用之不盡，而尚要拼命「吸收」，又為何來？</p>
<p>如果說為子孫遺產計，那末我又要翻出幾句陳舊的史話來了，漢朝李廣說得好：子孫們「賢而多財，是損其志；愚而多財，是益其過。」以其遺子孫以財產，遠不如為子孫積點功德。</p>
<p>多金何益？世之有「金癖」者，可以看穿點了吧！</p>
<h3>應雲衛導演「無名氏」中之秦怡</h3>
<h3>友情論</h3>
<p>— 雪花</p>
<p>我有過許多親近的朋友，他們正如我每天必定要呼吸一樣，牠使你解除精神上肉體上許多侵襲而來的痛楚；因此，每次我想起朋友，一定感動得「熟淚」盈眶。</p>
<p>人本來不能過孤居生活呵！人必需過着合羣的生活。而朋友，便是這些人羣活動中，最規切·最溫暖·人情味最高的象徵。</p>
<p>但是，友情也往往隨着社會生活的動盪而在變質；他們對你的衡量，為着各方面的冲激，使他們常常變得非常冷酷，非常世故，非常「現實主義」。一切交往都好像商人做「買賣」一樣以一種「交易」的方式，和你衡量友情的輕重。</p>
<p>他有求於你的時候，只在你週圍打轉，發出一種本能的「唔—唔—」之音，諂媚的，婉轉的，低沉的，親切的，向你訴說他的要求；於是，你被他感動得「渾身發頓」，呵！友情是應該珍惜的呵！</p>
<p>但是氣候天色的演變，也決比不上這些「溫柔低沉語言」變化的迅速，牠們能由高熱度結凍成冰。</p>
<p>他們會在你週　結下天羅地網，劃下其深無底的鴻溝，一旦你有求於他的時候，他冷冷地對你搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>「沒有辦法呵！」</p>
<p>在這種「冷酷」的「溫度」下，我常常感覺自己已凍結成「冰」。「奉公守法」</p>
<p>「奉公守法」　余忘我民。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他在快走近那中年男五時，又用右手握拳，在目己腰背上搥了幾下。</p>
<p>「倒是咱們年輕的人不成」！他的臉上做出了一絲苦笑，似依然是非常的文秀。田先生，您眞是老當益壯」！</p>
<p>田先生微微一笑，眼睛却越向旁邊去張望。</p>
<p>「怎慶？老祝倒走了」！他顯得很困惑。</p>
<p>「不是嗎？人家都在忙着，他偏要趕出去找人……」。高鼻　髮的人很快就猜到了對方的心事。「田先生找他，不是要排明天準備演的活報嗎」？</p>
<p>「訛說不是？朱小姐她們全等在樓下哩」！田先生皺一皺眉頭，便轉一個身，移動兩條穿着高統靴的腿，望樓梯口走去，一面自語般的低聲嘰咕着：「老祝人是熱心的，就差有一點亂！……」走了幾步，忽然又像想起了什麼似的突然站住，轉過身來，高聲地問：「老祝道一會究竟是上那兒去的？劇本還在他那兒啦」！</p>
<p>「他是找徐……徐紹明去的」。鼻鬈髮的人似乎有一些碍口。</p>
<p>穿軍裝的人顯然聽不懂他所說的那會事。</p>
<p>「徐紹明？中孚的總經理……」。他開始思索。</p>
<p>十幾個點鈔票的人裹面，走出了一個身材矮小，臉上例外地不帶笑容的人來。</p>
<p>「田光生，劇本在這兒。老祝給你留下了」！他向屋隅一口竹　的書概走去，打開門，檢出了一卷油印的東西。他的左腿有一些瘸，走路身子搖擺得很厲害，但並不慢，別人看上去有一些吃力。他把劇本遞給了田先生，便立刻又一拐一拐地走回大桌子邊去，繼續帮助大家點鈔票；封於其他的事，好像全不感興趣似的。</p>
<p>田先生接過那卷劵本，瞧了一瞧外面裹的那張紙，心裹又高興了。</p>
<p>「我想老祝不致那末糊塗」！他再度　樓梯口走去。「他去找徐紹明捐錢，留下字要我光給他排戲」。</p>
<p>高統靴的聲音，一下一下的在樓梯上　着。</p>
<p>「老祝那樣的人就有老田歡喜他，眞是一封怪物」！高鼻鬆髮的人透出不很高興的神氣，從門口邊又退進去，向站在他近旁的一個點鈔票的人說：「老李，快完事嗎？咱們先吃飯去」！</p>
<p>老李顯然跟他有一樣的心意。</p>
<p>「對不起，我這幾紮全是五千元的，你們歸總吧！我跟老鍾先走一步！他把己川橡皮筋套起來的四五疊鈔票，推給了旁邊的人，兩手望褲管上擦了一擦，轉身跟着老鍾就走。</p>
<p>「這兒就快開飯啦！你們還走嗎」？三四個人在他們背後這樣問。</p>
<p>「回家去吃」！老鍾合糊地回答，頭也沒有回過來，兩個人很快的就下樓了。</p>
<p>「老鍾能吃這兒的飯嗎？唉！人家是老板階級」！那個身材矮小，滿面憂容的人，用着酸溜溜的話說。中間還莫名其妙地夾上一聲長嘆。</p>
<p>「今兒他喊得的確很費力，也許員想回去休息一下」有人給老鍾這樣解釋。（二）</p>

<h3>Chairman Receives Chiang Meng-lin and Others, Government Reorganization Actively Underway, Representatives of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Arrive in the Capital for Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Chairman Chiang summoned Chiang Meng-lin at 9 AM on the 2nd, inquiring about various affairs of the Executive Yuan after Soong Tzu-wen's resignation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Today, all New York morning and afternoon newspapers published the news of President Soong Tzu-wen's resignation and Chairman Chiang's concurrent position as Premier of the Executive Yuan on their front pages. However, as the news arrived on the weekend, most offices were already closed for holidays, making it impossible to immediately ascertain the reactions from all sides.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Following the simultaneous announcement of the increased quota list for the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and the People's Political Council, along with the Chairman's concurrent leadership of the Executive Yuan, Lei Chen took the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) train to Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd. It is said that this is a manifestation of the government's determination to expedite the reorganization. Mr. Lei will conduct discussions in Shanghai with various parties regarding the next steps in the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the National Government after the four institutions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Secretary-General Lei Chen arrived in Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning (the 2nd). His purpose is to invite officials from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to go to the capital and discuss further government reorganization with Chairman Chiang. After leaving the train, Mr. Lei visited the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties separately. Both parties expressed their agreement to go to the capital for discussions. The Youth Party immediately decided to send Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, while the Democratic Socialist Party also decided, after a meeting at 4 PM that afternoon, to have figures such as Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Tang Zhuxin, Feng Jinbai, Wan Renqian, and Lu Guangsheng participate. Furthermore, all the standing committee members of both parties stationed in the capital also attended the discussions. Mr. Lei and the representatives of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties are scheduled to take the train to the capital tonight (the 3rd).</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Following Soong Tzu-wen's resignation, Weng Wenhao, Chiang Meng-lin, and Yu Hongjun also submitted their resignations. It is understood that the central authorities intend to consider them after the government reorganization. Zhang Qun is said to be the most highly regarded candidate for the position of Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan. It is reported that when Mr. Soong submitted his resignation, the Chairman tried to persuade him to stay, but Mr. Soong expressed his willingness to be responsible outside the financial and economic aspects and to continue working hard for the country.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since Premier Soong's resignation, there have been many rumors in the market, even suggesting that the gold and price control policies would be abandoned. According to an observer who spoke to our reporter, although Mr. Soong has resigned, it should not affect the policies, as the emergency measures program was announced by Chairman Chiang himself. Moreover, the successor is a cautious and conservative person who is unlikely to make many changes during this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Chairman of the Democratic League Zhang Lan, in his personal capacity, sent a letter to Chairman Chiang. It was previously brought to the capital by Mr. Luo Longji. It is now known that the letter was not submitted to the Chairman and was brought back to Shanghai by Ye Duyi the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Ye, the letter was about to be presented when the government urged the withdrawal of the CCP personnel and Premier Soong's resignation was approved, causing the situation to change. The content of the letter had become outdated, so he brought it back himself. It will be brought up for revision at today's (the 2nd) meeting. It is understood that the revised letter will more specifically state the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League recently denied rumors that members of the Democratic League would be withdrawing to Hong Kong. It is said that some members of the Democratic League may go to Hong Kong, but it will not affect the work of the Democratic League in the country. The Democratic League's stance remains unchanged, and it will continue to strive for unification, peace, and democracy. He considered the news that he and Luo Longpeng were members of the Communist Party to be "malicious rumors."</p>
<h3>CCP Personnel Remaining in Shanghai Scheduled to Go to the Capital and Return to Yan'an, List Submitted to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The list of personnel withdrawing from the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party was submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 4 PM yesterday, totaling 34 people: 17 from Zhou Enlai's residence at 107 Sinan Road and 17 from the Xinhua Daily office on Zhubaoshan Road. The list of five CCP staff members working at the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been submitted and will be handled separately. These personnel have agreed to travel to Beijing by train at 7 AM on the morning of the 5th, and together with the personnel from the CCP's Beijing liaison office, will return to Yan'an by US military plane on the 7th. Dong Biwu, his wife He Lianzhi, his son Dong Xisheng (2 years old), and Dong's follower Liu Guoan, etc., took the train to Beijing last night at 11 PM. It is reported that before his departure, Mr. Dong sent a letter to Commander Xuan Tiewu, making certain statements. The list of withdrawing personnel submitted by the CCP is transcribed as follows: (1) List of personnel from Zhou's residence: Dong Biwu (CCP representative), He Lianzhi (Dong's wife), Dong Xisheng (Dong's son), Hua Shifu (CPPCC advisor), Pan Zinian (Xinhua Daily president), Chen Jiakang (secretary), Qian Zhiguang (section chief), Liu Ang (Qian's wife), Liu Shu (secretary), Lu (Liu's wife), Zheng (staff), Yang Shaolin (general affairs), Liu Guoan (Dong Biwu's follower), Wang Wenzhong (messenger), Huang Yuexian (maid), Wu Yuefeng (maid), Ji Jinzhou (driver).

<h3>Zhou Enlai Requests Postponement of Withdrawal Date</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] The CCP Liaison Office in Beijing received a telegram from Zhou Enlai in Yan'an to Chairman Chiang on the 1st, hoping to extend the withdrawal period to the end of March. Wang Bingfu took the telegram to Wu Dingchang, the National Government's Chief of Civilian Affairs, on the morning of the 2nd. Failing to meet him, he left the letter at the National Government and then visited Shao Lizi to inform him of the intention. Wang then visited Zhang Qun, but failed to meet him. The reason for visiting Zhang was that the CCP personnel in Chongqing numbered over 200, but the US planes could only accommodate 100 people, so he specifically visited Mr. Zhang to ask for a solution. On the evening of the 2nd, CCP spokesperson Mei Yi told reporters that the Beijing Liaison Office would return to Yan'an in its entirety only after the withdrawals from Shanghai and Chongqing were completed. Furthermore, 25 people from the Beijing Office returned to Yan'an by US plane at 9 AM on the 2nd. The US Embassy recently notified the CCP Beijing Office that the US could dispatch three C-47 aircraft to transport CCP Beijing Office personnel between the 2nd and the 7th. In addition, two large transport planes would be responsible for transporting Beijing Office personnel.</p>
<h3>US Statement on Transporting CCP Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] The US Embassy recently issued a written statement on the matter of transporting Communist personnel back to Yan'an, stating that it would be extended to complete between the 2nd and the 7th. The full text is as follows: "On February 6th of this year, the US government expressed its willingness to assist responsible Communist personnel in withdrawing to the Communist areas before March 5th. At the same time, it also helped government personnel withdraw to their original locations. As of February 21st, the CCP personnel of the Executive Headquarters had completely withdrawn to the Communist areas, and the government personnel had also reached their original locations. Only the withdrawal of CCP personnel from Chongqing, Shanghai, and Beijing has been delayed until now because neither the government nor the CCP could formally express their hope on this matter. On the 26th and 28th, the CCP finally submitted an application for the withdrawal of 167 people from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. The US has now scheduled the departure dates based on the application. This transportation work must last until the 7th due to weather and other technical limitations."</p>
<h3>CCP Personnel in Sichuan and Kangding Ordered to Concentrate and Withdraw by a Deadline</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 1st] A spokesperson for the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters told reporters that the CCP staff in the counties and cities of the Sichuan and Kangding provinces under the headquarters' jurisdiction have been ordered to concentrate and withdraw entirely by March 9th. It is hoped that the CCP staff in various places will voluntarily register with the county governments so that they can be properly protected and transported to their requested destinations. If they do not comply, the county and city governments will not be responsible for their protection. The Chengdu Garrison Command, believing that the Chengdu office of the Xinhua Daily uses the distribution of newspapers and periodicals as a pretext, often has a small number of unnecessary personnel staying in the urban area, affecting public security. It has recently sent a letter to the office, hoping that the CCP's overt and covert staff in Chengdu will be registered and sent to the office's dormitory at No. 3 Xin San Road, Dongcheng Geng Street, by March 4th. They will be completely withdrawn by March 5th, and the command will send troops to escort them to Baoji for transfer to Yan'an.</p>

<h3>The So-Called Anti-Liaison Incident Was Manufactured by the Communist Party, Incriminating Documents Seized in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The so-called "Anti-Liaison" incident was a Communist conspiracy to instigate, as proven by the Communist documents obtained.

<h3>National Army Advances on Changji Line, Du Yuming Flies to Changchun, 20,000 Communist Troops Attacking Dehui Annihilated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Director Du Yuming arrived here by special plane from Shenyang at 3:50 PM today. This is his second visit to Changchun since June 12th last year. Many of his senior staff members arrived here by special train a day earlier, proving that Mr. Du will stay in Changchun for quite some time to personally command the front-line military. Du was surrounded by dozens of reporters at his official residence, asking him to make a statement. He said: He is not good at this. A reporter asked, "When can we go to Dehui for inspection?" He said: "Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow!" Du believes that the goal of the Communist army's all-out attack this time is Changchun, and judges that the main force of the Communist army is now in the triangular area between Dehui and Jiutai. He said: More than 1,000 Communist troops once carried a large amount of explosives to Kaiyuan, attempting to destroy the Changshen railway line, but failed. Communist troops also tried to invade HuaiDe north of Siping and were repelled. Communist troops in Andong also harassed the Jishen line, and the Liuhe station east of Meihekou is still occupied by the Communist army. These activities are all to respond to the war in the Jichang area. Du also said that two divisions of the Communist army had planned to cross the Anshen line to invade Dashiqiao but had been intercepted. He also said that he would return to Shenyang after the front-line war came to an end and would go to the front-line for inspection in the next few days.</p>

The Communist troops on each line were fleeing in disarray without effective resistance. It is expected that fierce battles may occur on the Changha line tonight.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The National Army on the main Changha line crossed the Buhai Station (62 kilometers north of Changchun, only 18 kilometers from Dehui) after noon today. It is expected to join forces with the defenders of Dehui tonight or tomorrow morning. The Jichang line eastern advance National Army, after breaking the weak resistance of the Communist troops in Longjiabao, the vanguard has advanced to the Yinma River, only 10 kilometers from Jiutai County. The National Army on the Changtao line marched into Nongan, 62 kilometers from Changchun, at 8 AM this morning and continued to advance. It can be seen that the main force of the Communist troops did not make any organized resistance and collapsed. According to the aerial reconnaissance report today: a large number of Communist troops on the Changha and Jichang lines fled in the northeast direction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 2nd] Reporters recently learned from the military that the Communist troops besieging Dehui began to attack the National Army in the city from the 26th of last month, constantly increasing their troops, until yesterday when it turned into a fierce battle. At 8:30 yesterday morning, the Communist troops, with four divisions, made a desperate attempt to break into the Liudao Street area of Dehui. The National Army relied on fortifications to calmly fight back. After dusk, the Communist troops were all annihilated except for a few who escaped. In total, about 20,000 people were annihilated. In addition, more than 600 people were captured. The captured military supplies are being inventoried.

<h3>Japan Resumes Foreign Trade 16 Months After Surrender, Allied Headquarters Tells Our Press Corps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Sixteen months after Japan's surrender, it has quickly resumed foreign trade under the supervision of Allied Headquarters. Allied Headquarters officials told the Chinese press corps in Japan today that Japan has trade relations with the following places: China, the United States, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Japan's main exports are textiles. Japan's pre-war number of spindles was 13 million tons, of which 2.5 million were used. 80% of textile exports are to earn foreign exchange. Japanese food and clothing rations are currently very low, with only five pounds of textiles per person per year. Japan's foreign trade is under the supervision of the headquarters, so any country that wants to obtain anything from Japan can contact the headquarters, and the headquarters can negotiate with the Japanese government. The headquarters obtains goods from the Japanese government and sells them to the relevant countries at world market prices in US dollars. The foreign exchange obtained in this way is not handed over to the Japanese government but is stored as the headquarters' trust funds. At the same time, the headquarters also purchases goods needed by Japan from the relevant countries and pays for them with the value of Japanese exports. Japan's main exports to China are mining wood, machinery, telephone poles, and phosphate rock. The ships going to and from China and Japan are Japanese ships. China was the first country to resume trade with Japan. As early as October 1945, the Chinese government consulted with the headquarters to trade with Japan on an exchange basis. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for the Chinese side.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] US Eighth Army officials, when reviewing the situation of the Soviet Union's stationed occupation forces in Japan to the Chinese press corps in Japan this morning, told them that the list of Japanese materials for reparations has almost been completed. All countries that can receive reparations can visit some of the factories that supply reparations. Negotiations on the distribution of reparations to various countries are still underway in Washington. The commander of the US Eighth Army is 61-year-old Wenqierberg, who not only has military control over Japan but also economic control. Ai hosted a banquet for the Chinese press corps in Japan at his private residence this afternoon. Ai has visited China several times and knows a lot about Chinese history. He spoke about Beiping with excitement and said: "Beiping is the most beautiful city in the world." The basic tasks of the military government of the Eighth Army include: (1) promoting Japan's production to meet its peacetime needs, (2) supervising and controlling Japanese reparations goods, and developing the list of production. Currently, it is being hampered by a lack of raw materials (especially coal and food). Reporters asked if the Allied Headquarters would allow Japan to produce more than its domestic needs, thereby affecting our country's industry? He replied: The Allied Headquarters must give proper consideration to this aspect.</p>
<h3>Press Corps Very Busy with Receptions, Receiving Wine Non-Stop</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] On the way to Japan by plane, the Chinese press corps had to land on Iwo Jima. After this "dusty" scare, this ten-member press corps certainly needs "wash the dust and suppress the shock".

The day after arriving here, the first was a banquet hosted by Marshal MacArthur to "wash the dust", followed by "wash the dust" for them by the commander of the US Eighth Army, Ai Qierberg. Last night, General Zhu Shiming, the head of our delegation in Japan, "washed the dust" for them, and tonight General Zhu will hold a cocktail party for them again.</p>

<h3>Xu Siping Talks About Inspection Impressions: Progress in Military Service in Southeast China; Deferred Conscription for Civil Servants, Students, etc. Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Director of the Military Service Bureau Xu Siping received reporters from this newspaper on the 2nd and talked about his impressions of the recent inspection of military service in various places in Southeast China, saying: I left Nanjing on January 4th. During these two months, I visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces for inspection. There are four main goals of this trip: (1) To inspect the implementation of military service in the new military service institutions. In general, the new military service institutions in various places in Southeast China are relatively reasonable and legal. Compared with the past, malpractices have been greatly reduced. (2) To explain military service laws and regulations so that local governments and people can understand the government's legislative intentions. (3) To inspect the organization and training of the National Guard in various places. (4) To urge various places to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers who were wounded and disabled in the war. The impression of this trip is very good. The following are the feelings gained: (1) The general public's trust in military service personnel has improved. (2) After enlisting in the army, soldiers do not lack food and clothing, the desertion rate has decreased, and sick soldiers are also less than 1%. Although there is a phenomenon of substitution, the blame does not lie with the military service personnel, but with the people themselves. The most difficult thing at present is the insufficient number of barracks. This is the biggest defect. Xu also told reporters that it was originally planned to establish 60 division barracks nationwide, and 53 have been established. The rest will be established in order soon. When reporters asked when conscription would begin in Nanjing and Shanghai, Xu said that the above two places are still in preparation. The handling of household registration in Shanghai is better than in other places. The government is considering how to deal with the issue of deferred conscription for civil servants, students, workers, and shop assistants. However, military service values fairness. If the planned plans can be implemented, the whole country must "look to the right" within the year. The household registration in Taiwan is precise, but unfortunately 19 out of 10 people do not understand Mandarin. Whether conscription will be carried out within the year has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Working Together with One Heart and One Mind, Helping Each Other and Cooperating, Striving to Eliminate Construction Obstacles: Chiang (also Head of the Corps) Encourages Students of the Central Training Corps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Spring Friendship Association of students staying in Nanjing from the Party and Government Class of the Central Training Corps was held at the corps in Xiaolingwei at 10:00 AM on the 1st. More than 2,000 students from various classes of the Party and Government Class attended. Deputy Head of the Corps Chen Cheng, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, He Zhonghan, Chiang Ching-kuo, and others participated. Head of the Corps Chiang visited at 11:00 AM. After leading the salute, he gave an impromptu speech, saying: Comrades, for the past ten years, the purpose of your training in this corps has been to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and complete the cause of national construction. Now the War of Resistance has been won, but national construction has not yet succeeded. The heavy responsibility is still on our shoulders, and we must continue to work hard. Recalling the eight years of the War of Resistance, our officers and soldiers and compatriots across the country sacrificed countless lives and property to win victory. Our loyal, brave, and heroic War of Resistance made our Republic of China a model and pioneer in resisting violent aggression and defending the nation and race, and won the admiration of people all over the world. In theory, after the victory of the War of Resistance, our country should have been able to achieve a lofty international position in the world and promote our glorious history. However, everyone should look at how low our international position is today and how much the suffering of our people has deepened. People's admiration has turned into contempt, and our glory has turned into humiliation. Who caused this? It is very obvious that it is because after the victory, the unity of our country was destroyed. But why did someone dare to destroy the unity of the country? Why can't our country maintain the unity of the country? Today, everyone must ask themselves whether they have fulfilled their responsibilities. I believe that we revolutionary comrades demand all problems of me, if everyone can be diligent, then no one can hinder our revolutionary undertakings, our country will be able to unify the peaceful building. Do not say that we have more than 3 million revolutionary party members, everyone is working hard, everyone is united, will be able to complete the revolution, that is, the more than 20,000 students of the corps can unite and work hard, can complete the revolution. At today's memorial meeting of the corps after the victory in all capitals, I hope that all comrades will thoroughly reflect and self-examine. If there are places where we have not worked hard enough in the past, we must work doubly hard in the future. If there are places where we have not united enough in the past, we must strengthen our unity in the future. I believe that as long as we all work together with one heart and one mind, help each other and cooperate, the obstacles to national construction can be eliminated in one and a half years, so as to complete our rehabilitation work, lay the foundation for national construction, and the great cause of revolutionary national construction will surely succeed in our hands, so as not to live up to the mission of everyone in the corps.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reading President Song's Report on Finance and Economy</h3>
<p>In his report to the Legislative Yuan, President Song strongly emphasized that the current economic and financial ills are due to inflation. The reason for the inflation is that the Communists have wantonly sabotaged the country after the victory, and peace has not been restored. This is an ironclad fact. In this situation, to stop inflation, he believes that it is necessary to crack down on speculation on the one hand, and to try to restore the balance of payments on the other. This is also a necessary measure. However, speculation is not enough to increase inflation, but is the result of inflation. Therefore, to truly curb this inflationary trend, in addition to eliminating the rebellion and restoring peace, the only proper way is to balance income and expenditure.</p>
<p>How can we balance income and expenditure? According to Song's statement, and as stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the items are (1) rectifying tax revenue, (2) opening up new tax sources, (3) transferring state-owned enterprises, (4) continuing to sell enemy and puppet property and surplus materials, (5) public utilities being self-sufficient, and (6) stopping payment of any unnecessary or deferrable expenses.</p>
<p>With the exception of the second item, even if it is not for balancing income and expenditure, it should still be done. Currently, items three and five are being planned and implemented, and item four is a continuing undertaking. What the second item refers to seems too vague. It is said that a one-time property tax will be levied, but this may not be feasible in practice. This newspaper has already pointed this out, and Western newspapers have also expressed doubts. Therefore, the points that should be particularly noted and worked on at present are items one and six.</p>
<p>Song cited income tax as an example, believing that with serious rectification, an income of 800 billion yuan can be expected in the coming months. Income tax is a major source of tax revenue, and after serious rectification, its revenue will naturally be considerable. However, we believe that no matter what kind of tax revenue, if it can be seriously rectified, its revenue will definitely improve significantly. This is because the efficiency of tax administration is actually too poor now. Tax evasion, smuggling, and making false accounts are almost open secrets. Moreover, some unscrupulous officials inevitably engage in malfeasance, embezzlement, solicitation, and profiteering. As the saying goes: "The wool comes from the sheep's back." The more private interests are gained, the greater the public loss will naturally be. In order to speed up tax revenue, the Chairman once pointed out that "there is no need to pursue precise calculations to the point of prolonged delay, but rather to adopt rapid and effective collection methods." These words are naturally very correct. However, at the same time, if it is not supplemented by sound personnel management and clear rewards and punishments, then methods that are too strict will only lead to prolonged delays, while methods that are too lax will make it easier to manipulate things from top to bottom, allowing even large ships to slip through the net. Therefore, in rectifying tax revenue, we mainly advocate focusing on rectifying personnel management and discipline at the same time. As for the fundamental [blank], it lies in understanding the ability of taxpayers to bear the burden, reducing excessively high tax rates, and referring to their level of knowledge and habits to eliminate all excessively harsh procedures. As everyone knows, the motive for merchants and civilians to engage in smuggling, tax evasion, making false accounts, and colluding with unscrupulous officials is nothing more than to reduce the burden and seek self-preservation, not necessarily to willingly break the law. Complying with people's feelings will naturally make orders flow like water. Recently, I heard about such an incident: a certain bureau sent personnel to distribute tax forms to each household, asking them to fill them out by the deadline. Because the content was too complicated, most recipients could not fill them out and had to ask the personnel for guidance. Who knew that the personnel also did not understand and made various excuses, leading to disputes. Just imagine: if the people responsible for handling the matter do not understand, how can they ask people to comply by the deadline? If those who want to comply cannot start, how can tax revenue surge?</p>
<p>As for stopping the payment of unnecessary or deferrable expenses, this is naturally something that everyone agrees with. However, to implement this proposition, there are also two preconditions that must be met. First, whether it is the central or local government, the highest competent authority must be in charge of this matter and resolve it from a political perspective. If it is completely left to the disbursement or accounting departments to decide, I am afraid that they [blank] this power and it will not be easy to reach a moderate and appropriate decision. If the departments receiving funds are allowed to state their reasons, then even building public toilets [blank] and public cafeterias will have their legitimate and necessary reasons. The reason why expenditures are so huge now and the budget cannot be [blank] made is because the highest competent authorities all want to be good people and are unwilling to examine the situation and approve or reject things impartially.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to start by abolishing all unnecessary and deferrable undertakings. The expenses of various institutions can be roughly divided into administrative expenses and operating expenses, and administrative expenses come from operating the undertakings. Therefore, to stop the payment of their expenses, one should first stop the operation of the undertakings. Otherwise, if the operating expenses are stopped and only the administrative expenses are paid, everyone will be sitting around all day doing nothing. Is this administrative expense not equivalent to wasting money? Or, if only the operating expenses are paid and the administrative expenses are stopped, how will these operating expenses be used? The above two items will not only cause such phenomena when the entire sum is stopped, but even if a portion is simply reduced, it will greatly frustrate the institution and the undertaking. Therefore, to truly save these unnecessary and deferrable expenses, one must boldly stop these unnecessary and deferrable undertakings first.</p>
<h3>Mourning Mr. Powell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news came from Washington that Mr. Powell, a friend of China, suddenly passed away on the 28th of last month! Especially when he was loudly appealing to American people to pay attention to the allied country of China, he closed his eyes immediately after finishing his speech. Whether they knew him or not, all Chinese people, upon hearing the sad news of the death of this friend, expressed their deep sorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Powell came to China in 1917 and published the "Millard's Review of the Far East" in Shanghai. Relying on his strong pen, he called for justice and for the freedom and prosperity of China. Anyone who has read his works deeply admires his clear understanding of China. Only someone like Mr. Powell can be called an expert on Chinese affairs. Compared with those reporters who come to China for a cursory look and then talk nonsense, the difference cannot be calculated here. Mr. Powell has been in China for nearly 25 years, and almost all of his most valuable time has been spent in China. China can truly be said to be his second [blank] country.</p>
<p>What we will never forget about Mr. Powell is that, for the sake of justice and China, he was envied by the Japanese, who regarded him as the number one anti-Japanese element and always wanted to put him to death. Before the Pearl Harbor Incident, Mr. Powell was still in Shanghai, fighting against the evil forces. Any text he published was banned by the Japanese. At that time, Japanese agents followed him at all times, using threats and temptations, using all possible means, but Mr. Powell seemed to be a pillar in the midstream, standing firm. Later, the puppet organization in Nanjing even issued an arrest warrant, but he remained unchanged. Such integrity is truly rare. But soon, the Pacific War finally broke out, and Mr. Powell was arrested by the Japanese military police. He was subjected to torture by the Japanese military police, and his legs were the most severely injured. It was not until 1942 that he was sent back to his country and treated in the hospital until now, but his legs have remained half paralyzed.</p>
<p>Last year, during the Tokyo trial of Japanese war criminals, Mr. Powell, despite his disability, still traveled to Tokyo to testify. After returning to his country, his health was even worse than before. But no one expected him to die suddenly. How can we not mourn the loss of a good friend when the sad news comes!</p>
<p>American scholars and celebrities who study Far Eastern issues often only know one thing and not the other, and even only use the perspective of Western society to evaluate the progress of reform in ancient Eastern countries, so they often publish some seemingly correct but actually wrong remarks, which make us laugh or cry. But this friend of China has such a clear and deep understanding of the Far Eastern situation and Chinese issues that any opinion he expresses is not something that those who do not understand the truth of the Far East and the dynamics of Chinese society can say. In December last year, American public opinion on Chinese issues was complex and bizarre. Even Dean Acheson, the director of the Far Eastern Affairs Office of the State Department, had once issued an admonition to Americans not to invest in China. At that time, Mr. Powell heard this fallacy and mobilized righteous Americans to jointly write to President Truman to express their serious concern. We are not being selfish, but Mr. Powell's righteous words are indeed worthy of our eternal remembrance.</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Powell's life seems to have been lived for serving China, and he has given us countless contributions. After hearing the sad news of his death, our sincerity cannot be fully expressed merely by mourning the passing of an ordinary colleague. We silently pray for the peace of Mr. Powell's soul! We especially silently wish for the democratic progress of China, so as not to fail Mr. Powell's expectations!</p>

<h3>Preventing the Greek Communist Party from Overthrowing the Government - British Troops Should Remain in Greece - The US Requests This Point from the UK and Promises Economic Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] According to reliable sources today, the United States has requested that Britain continue to station troops in Greece and agreed to provide economic assistance in order to prevent a civil war sufficient to turn back the Greek government and prevent the Communist Party from opening the door to the Near East. The United States also assured Britain that the United States is immediately considering taking over most of the economic burden in Greece, as Britain can no longer bear it. The United States also promised that this economic assistance will be implemented soon. Undersecretary of State Acheson delivered a note to the British Ambassador to the United States, Inverchapel, this morning. Although the content of the note has not been disclosed, it is known that it is about providing rapid military assistance and some military assistance not including troops. The so-called some military assistance is understood to be rifles, other military equipment, or surplus military materials, etc., but the United States has no intention of sending troops. The US note is a response to a note previously sent by Britain to the United States, which stated that Britain was unable to continue its military and economic assistance to Greece after March 31 due to the seriousness of its domestic situation. President Truman held a secret meeting at the White House on February 27. Forty-eight hours later, the United States sent out this note. According to British sources, they are very satisfied with the US reply. They also requested that assistance to Greece be implemented before Secretary of State Marshall goes to Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10. Some US congressmen advocated taking immediate action. Democratic Congressman Bloom also said, "We must help these people."</p>
<p>[This newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesman recently said that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently discussing in Washington the issue of the United Kingdom continuing to provide Greece with economic and military support. It is said that one of the issues discussed is the continued provision of foreign exchange to Greece so that it can purchase arms. It is also said that the United States will not send troops to Greece after the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. According to official sources, Foreign Secretary Bevin is planning to withdraw the last batch of 10,000 British troops from Greece within three months.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] Well-informed sources recently said that British policy in Greece has completely changed in the past few weeks. British military advisers, who previously advocated a moderate approach to the guerrillas, have now reversed their usual practice and are all encouraging the Greek government to take strict action and are providing the Greek government forces with weapons. At the same time, British economic experts are also advising the Greek government to find ways to obtain US economic assistance. The main reasons for the change in British policy are no more than three, namely: (1) Greece cannot continue to struggle in its current economic difficulties without endangering its social organization; (2) The United Kingdom is unable to improve its own economic panic and is unable to assist Greece; (3) The United Kingdom is deeply afraid that the current internal strife in Greece will continue unabated and will cause Greece to fall into the Eastern European bloc.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Greek Problem is Significant</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] Washington commentators believe that the situation caused by Britain's memorandum on the Greek problem is more serious than a general world crisis. Britain's request seems to imply that the country's various military and economic obligations in the Mediterranean should be transferred to the United States. Observers here believe that this is the most serious problem in American history. If the United States does not fill this gap when British troops withdraw from Greece, and causes a crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union, it will either allow the Soviet Union to fill this gap alone and endanger the balance of power in Europe and the world, or both. A Washington newspaper predicted that the reactions that could occur when Britain withdrew from Greece were: (1) the establishment of a communist government in Greece; (2) Turkey accepts the Soviet Union's request for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait; (3) Soviet power spreads throughout the Arab world.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Alliance Signed - Foreign Ministers of the Two Countries to Deliver Speeches - Belgium Expected to Join Military Equipment Standardization Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, last night that the United Kingdom and France will sign an alliance treaty in Dunkirk, which is enough to symbolize the two countries rising again from the dark ages of 1940 and restoring our position in handling world politics. In addition, newspapers here today expressed their sincere welcome to the signing of the alliance treaty between the United Kingdom and France, which is in harmony with the warm welcome in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 1st] A Belgian Ministry of Defense spokesman said that when Belgian Defense Minister Defreuder visits London next week, he will discuss with British authorities the expansion of the Anglo-American, American-Canadian, and weapons equipment standardization agreements to Belgium. It is said that this move was initiated by the British side.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Well-informed sources here recently said that the Belgian government is considering concluding an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union first, and then concluding an alliance treaty with the United Kingdom, following the same policy as the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty and the Anglo-French alliance treaty. The Belgian government may soon request to begin negotiations with the United Kingdom, but in order to avoid suspicion of organizing a Western bloc, Belgium may first try to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Eden Calls for Understanding Between East and West</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech last night at a meeting of the United Nations Association here, stating that if we want to seek lasting peace, the West and the East must understand each other. The allied governments in exile in London during the war had decided that after the trials of war, a true spirit of steadfast tolerance and understanding must be produced. Our planet has shrunk. Today, we are closer to San Francisco than we were to Basra a hundred years ago. We are so interdependent that we have to cooperate closely, whether we like it or not. Can we learn this lesson of interdependence? If we can, the standard of material prosperity will be limitless, and human happiness will reach its peak. If not, the wars of the future, coupled with the terror of modern weapons, may determine the fate of mankind, and we must choose.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Returns to England After Holiday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Field Marshal Montgomery, flew to Folkestone, Kent, this afternoon from Switzerland, and immediately took a car [blank] back to London. It is said that I felt very happy after spending my holiday in Switzerland and will be able to do my best for important work in the future.</p>
<h3>Prussia Ceases to Exist</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The Berlin Allied Control Council today promulgated Ordinance No. 46, announcing that the state of Prussia, the birthplace of German militarism, has in fact ceased to exist. Its land, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council, will be divided into other high-ranking states or merged into other states. The central government of Prussia and its affiliated institutions will also be abolished at the same time. The law was signed by four representatives and came into effect on February 25.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Nazi Underground Organization: Plotting to Kill Humans and Livestock with Bacteria, and Intending to Destroy Crops</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Mr. Paul Bauer, Secretary of the International European Affairs Committee and French scientist, stated: Anglo-American authorities in Germany recently arrested approximately 800 members of a Nazi underground organization. This organization possesses substantial funds in Switzerland and Argentina and is plotting to implement new plans, launching a horrific offensive against human civilization. They intend to spread diphtheria and typhoid bacteria, and to transmit oral and foot-and-mouth disease bacteria to livestock, thereby destroying crops. We have a person fluent in German who participated in this Nazi secret organization. He informed us that this new type of secret weapon is being manufactured, and after production, it will be a powdery substance to be spread in public places and vehicles. The International European Affairs Research Society has distributed a seven-page report to the prime ministers and foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the United States, and the Soviet Union, revealing the following facts, urging all countries to pay due attention. It is stated that Axis funds overseas have not yet been transferred to the Allies or liquidated. There are still hundreds of German companies in Argentina, of which 60 have funds worth 9,000 yuan. The Argentine government has no guarantee of liquidating these funds. Before the collapse of Germany, a considerable amount of Nazi funds fled to Switzerland and are still controlled by German leaders residing in that country. Bauer also stated that even today, many Germans are fleeing to South America via Sweden, changing their names and joining Nazi secret organizations. Finally, he said: Before the next war breaks out, countries with fifth columns will inevitably discover covert terrorist activities that undermine public health.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall Leads Delegation to Moscow Tomorrow: Comprehensive Resolution of U.S.-Soviet Issues Pending</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to travel to Moscow on the 4th to discuss various issues face-to-face with Soviet leaders. The U.S. delegation consists of 84 people, including more than 20 experts who are familiar with the following issues: (1) Resolution of the Soviet Union's Lend-Lease accounts, totaling $11.298 billion. (2) 95 ships that the United States transferred to the Soviet Union during the war, which the United States is requesting to be returned or compensated. (3) Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, destroying the damaged German warships, including the uncompleted aircraft carrier "Graf Zeppelin," which was detained by Soviet forces in Stettin, and Moscow has acknowledged the delay in its destruction. (4) Distribution of confiscated Italian ships.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest in the Far East do not seem to be on the agenda, as there are no Far East experts in the delegation. Disarmament and atomic control issues, as well as matters related to the United Nations organization, may be mentioned behind the scenes in Moscow. Secretary Marshall stated that whether he would discuss issues other than the German and Austrian peace treaties with Stalin and Molotov would depend on the circumstances, and that the Korean administrative issue would not be discussed. Based on the experience of previous meetings, diplomatic circles anticipate that the Moscow conference will last three to eight weeks, depending entirely on the extent of Soviet cooperation.</p>
<p>Turkey Concerned</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara] Turkish Prime Minister Peker told reporters yesterday that the Turkish government had recently exchanged views with several Allied governments regarding the upcoming Moscow conference, as it involves Turkey. The Prime Minister also stated that Turkey hopes to maintain friendly relations with all Arab countries, and Turkey hopes to obtain foreign loans.</p>
<h3>Situation in Palestine Worsens: British Army Club Bombed, Terrorists Active, Reaching Peak of Bloodshed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: A violent explosion occurred in Jerusalem this afternoon, with heavy gunfire near the Jewish Agency headquarters. An alert was issued throughout the city, and traffic was cut off. This is the first time that riots have occurred on the Sabbath in the modern history of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] Palestine today seems to be rapidly heading towards complete military rule. The British army is actively searching for armed terrorist groups, who launched an attack that destroyed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem, resulting in 16 deaths and 17 injuries. The British army claims to be in a state of alert. The government has imposed a curfew in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem and restricted residents in areas such as Dan, La, and Yafo from going out during curfew hours. British troops are patrolling the main streets of Jerusalem with armored cars and artillery vehicles, and troops are leaving the city to the north. Today is the bloodiest day in Palestine's terrorist period in nine months. Terrorists bombed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem and attacked the British army camp near Naseriyah with artillery, killing one and wounding two. They also planted landmines on the camel road near Haifa, destroying a jeep, killing and wounding two each. A truck was also destroyed by a landmine near Der Kark, injuring one British soldier. The barracks near Keren Aona were also attacked, with unknown casualties. A shell exploded near Havat HaMizracha. According to police reports, a fire broke out at the water station in Ras al-Ein. The commander of the British forces in Palestine, Macmillan, went to the residence of High Commissioner Cunningham in an armored car tonight, presumably to hold an emergency meeting. According to an announcement by the Information Office, the government will issue an important announcement soon.</p>
<p>Jewish Terrorist Group Admits Unambiguously</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish terrorist group Irgun admitted today that they bombed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem, stating that this action was in retaliation for the British army's expulsion of Jewish compatriots, and that no fortress is sufficient to protect the British.</p>
<h3>International Military Formation: United Nations Under Study</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Regarding the organization of an international army to be controlled by United Nations agencies, according to reliable sources, the United Nations Military Staff Committee has completed its study of the principles of utilizing such forces and is now studying its organizational methods.</p>
<h3>World Bank</h3>
<p>Policies and Goals May Change</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] Prominent economist Ms. Potter recently published an article in the "New York Post," predicting that domestic and international political trends in the United States will greatly change the policies and goals of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It is said that the American representatives of the bank will be completely replaced by bankers with commercial experience. The bank will become more commercialized and lack the ambition to assist the world in achieving economic stability, thereby promoting lasting peace. The role of the World Bank established by the Bretton Woods Agreement will be secondary in practical considerations. The changes in U.S. policy are due to the following factors: (1) The deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations. Although the Soviet Union is a signatory to the monetary agreement, it is not a member of the International Bank. As a result, several countries that were originally considered valuable borrowers by the United States are now within the Soviet sphere of influence and no longer have their value. (2) The main policies of the bank may be revised. It is now being considered that lending should be for commercial purposes, rather than for economic and political purposes. (3) Since the Republican Party's political victory last November, its criticism of the United States' entire foreign economic policy has intensified, and the International Bank is no exception.</p>
<h3>United Nations Associations Decide to Establish Office in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st Special Dispatch] The Council of the World Federation of United Nations Associations today passed a proposal by the Chinese delegation to establish a Far East Regional Office in China. The Council appointed a special committee, including members from China, the United States, Belgium, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, to study the plans for the Far East Regional Office. The U.S. delegation proposed raising funds in the United States to assist in the establishment of the regional office. The Council also resolved to send the Secretary-General of the Association, Mr. Ennals, to visit various countries in the Far East this summer for inspection. The Association will hold a large gathering at Albert Hall tonight, with speeches by several prominent figures, including Mr. Eden, Mr. Masaryk, and Mr. Cheng Zixiao.</p>
<h3>United Nations Administration of Japan: MacArthur Reportedly Submits Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 1st] Mr. Cunningham, editor of the Christian Science Monitor, wrote on the 1st that General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, will suggest that the administration of the occupation of Japan be transferred to the United Nations as soon as possible after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, as a test of collective security areas. It is said that when Mr. Cunningham recently visited Japan, MacArthur pre-informed him of this suggestion during a private meeting. MacArthur believes that the following two things are very necessary: (1) Proper military surveillance of Japan to ensure that it does not violate the various clauses in the peace treaty. To achieve this goal, the United Nations should establish an international police force sufficient to assume this surveillance duty. (2) Guidance, cultivation, and assistance in all technical problems for completing democracy. To achieve this goal, the United Nations should send international civil affairs experts to Japan.</p>
<p>The newspaper also quoted MacArthur as saying: "The problems of peace and war cannot be solved by military chatting tools, but must be solved by the awakening of the human spirit."</p>
<p>[China News Agency, Boston, 2nd] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower told a reporter yesterday that the United Nations' occupation of Japan can serve as a model for any future collective security mechanism. After the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan in the future, the occupation mission should continue, and the education in Japan will be democratized by the United Nations' civil affairs agencies.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek Awards Medal to Mexican President</h3>
<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 2nd] Chinese Ambassador to Mexico, Feng Chih-cheng, announced today that President Chiang Kai-shek has awarded the Special Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner to President Alemán.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] President Truman flew to Mexico at 8:00 this morning for his first visit. He will stop in Cranfield for one day to visit his 94-year-old mother, and will continue his journey on the 3rd.</p>

<h3>U.S. Export-Import Bank: Significant Contributions to Post-War World Recovery</h3>
<p>The year 1946 was a year of active American participation in stabilizing the post-war world. However, even if the massive efforts to restore the world economy after the war have made some headway, the tasks yet to be completed are still extremely arduous.</p>
<p>In these enormous reconstruction efforts, the United States bears a significant share. This effort is characterized by three features: First, the United States is the primary source of relief and construction goods needed worldwide; second, other countries are in poor condition, urgently needing supplies but unable to pay immediately, thus creating a significant financial problem; and third, the vast funds required for reconstruction pose a substantial repayment problem for the major creditor nations.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, there is no doubt that the United States has the capacity to produce the goods needed for reconstruction. Therefore, despite having the significant task of domestic recovery, it exported goods worth 8.75 billion yuan between July 1945 and July 1946. Exports continue to increase, currently reaching an annual rate of 10 billion yuan, not including the 3.8 billion yuan from sold-off lend-lease and surplus materials.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the nature and approximate amount of the financial problem, the U.S. government foresaw this issue even before the victory over Japan. These expenses can be broadly divided into three categories: funds for relief, funds for long-term construction and development, and funds needed to balance the U.S. budget deficit.</p>
<p>As is commonly recognized, emergency relief for the poorest countries should be handled on a purely charitable basis. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was established for this international purpose, and the United States contributed a total of 2.7 billion yuan, or 70% of its total funding.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods Agreement of July 1944 stipulated the establishment of the World Bank as a major post-war institution for providing foreign loans for long-term construction and development. However, due to delays in ratification, the World Bank's operations are only now beginning. The urgent needs after the occupation cannot be met by private capital alone. Therefore, to avoid a sharp decline in exports that would be detrimental to economic and social reconstruction, the United States is providing some credit loans until the World Bank can supply the funds needed for the emergency reconstruction of the war-torn world. To address this situation, the U.S. Congress amended the Export-Import Bank Act in 1945, increasing the bank's lending authority from 700 million to 3.5 billion yuan, removing the ban on lending to countries with unclear debts to the United States, and transferring the bank's management from a part-time board of trustees to a full-time, bipartisan board of directors.</p>
<p>The third feature of the reconstruction effort is the necessity of repaying long-term credit loans. This issue poses a thorny problem for the United States. If the United States hopes to have these loans repaid, its people must sooner or later face a situation of abundant imports.</p>
<p>To fulfill the mission stipulated in the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, the Export-Import Bank has committed loans totaling 2.65 billion yuan for general construction purposes. These credit loans include 655 million yuan originally required for purchasing goods under the lend-lease program, 1.277 billion yuan for emergency construction needs, and 13.3 million yuan for purchasing cotton. In the first category, France received 55 million yuan, Belgium received 55 million yuan, and the Netherlands received 50 million yuan, all for 30 years at an interest rate of 2 3/8%. The second category includes loans to Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Norway, Poland, China, Abyssinia, and Saudi Arabia, ranging from 3 million yuan to Saudi Arabia to 650 million yuan to France. The terms range from two years for the Netherlands to mostly 25 to 30 years. The interest rate on long-term loans is mostly 3% per annum, with only a few exceptions. Cotton loans are mostly granted to European countries, but cotton loans to China also reached 33 million yuan. These loans have shorter terms, from 15 to 24 months, with an annual interest rate of 2%.</p>
<p>Later, due to demand exceeding supply, the Export-Import Bank had to adopt restrictions on emergency construction loans to meet the minimum urgent needs of borrowers. Therefore, the bank authorities carefully study all loan applications based on the urgency of the borrower's needs, the borrower's own financial resources, the possibility of obtaining loans from other sources, the borrower's ability to effectively use the loan, and the impact of the loan on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>With the World Bank's lending operations about to begin soon, the period of emergency construction loans from the Export-Import Bank and the future plans of the Export-Import Bank are receiving much attention.</p>
<p>The fundamental purpose of the Export-Import Bank has been clearly defined by Congress as assisting "the financing of exports and imports and facilitating the exchange of commodities between the United States and any foreign country, or any agency or individual thereof." The bank has broad powers to handle general banking business and to make loans of any kind, provided that its exercise of power contributes to its fundamental purpose. It can lend to any borrower, and the amount is unlimited.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the bank has always been prepared to assist U.S. exporters and importers under appropriate conditions. The usual method of assisting exporters is to lend to individual U.S. exporters, providing them with funds to purchase specific materials and equipment. After the end of the war, the number of exporters seeking credit loans from the Export-Import Bank that could not be obtained from other private banks gradually increased. The gradual relaxation of U.S. export controls and the increasing foreign demand for U.S. goods are the reasons for the significant expansion of the export industry. However, just as before the war, U.S. export sales are conducted under the following three conditions: the style of daily necessities, the ability of foreign buyers, and the competition from other suppliers. Since the credit loan period is longer than the time that commercial banks can generally accommodate, exporters are naturally happy to borrow from the Export-Import Bank. The bank has accepted all legitimate requests of this nature in the past and is determined to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>So far, the bank has not made any loans to importers. However, the main reason for this is not that the bank is unwilling to grant such credit loans, but that U.S. importers have ways to borrow considerable funds from commercial banks and other sources.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank believes that increased imports are also an element of healthy and prosperous trade for the United States after the war. The bank has a special interest in this matter, because the bank's charter makes a special provision that the bank must have a reasonable assurance of repayment before granting a loan. At the same time, the Board of Directors believes that if the revival of world trade and the reconstruction of an effective multilateral trading system are successful, all countries that have received emergency construction loans will have no difficulty in repaying the loans.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that the greatest hope for the revival of world trade and the effective solution of the repayment problem lies in the reasonable expansion of U.S. imports. At the same time, if U.S. foreign loans cannot be extended indefinitely, the only way for borrowing countries to repay their debts and continue to purchase goods from the United States that are beneficial to them is through the U.S. import industry.</p>
<p>As the World Bank's early operations are about to begin, the issue of future construction and development loans from the Export-Import Bank has attracted much attention. In fact, when the U.S. foreign lending program was first conceived, the U.S. government had already foreseen that once the World Bank took over operations, the Export-Import Bank's long-term loans for construction and industrial development would definitely be greatly reduced. It has always been believed that the main institution for foreign construction and development loans should be the World Bank rather than the Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank's policy is not to compete with the World Bank, but to fully cooperate with it. It believes that from now on, long-term construction and development loans should fall within the purview of the World Bank. However, this does not mean that the Export-Import Bank will no longer consider short-term construction and development loans to Latin American countries and other countries, nor does it mean that the Export-Import Bank will stop all emergency construction loans in the future.</p>
<p>The Export-Import Bank believes that under special circumstances, that is, certain countries that have been damaged by war are not members of the World Bank and therefore cannot apply for loans from the World Bank, some financial assistance from the Export-Import Bank may still be needed. However, the bank's funds are limited and not omnipotent. It can only provide emergency remedies until the basic problems of each country can be broadly resolved through other means.

<h3>Fire Opposite Shanghai Grand Theater: Took Three Hours to Destroy Five Stores; Sick Woman Burned, Only Son Killed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A paint store, Yongkang Paint Store, opposite the Shanghai Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII (now Middle Yan'an Road) caught fire last night, lasting three hours and destroying five storefronts. The homeowner's wife, Yang Lou Shi, was injured, and her only son, Yang Zhigang, only seven years old, tragically died in the fire. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>At 7:50 PM last night, this reporter was passing by the Taishan District Fire Brigade when I suddenly heard the fire alarm blaring. A fire engine sped out, followed by a pumping water team, moving with extreme agility. Unfortunately, the engine was too old and traveled slowly. This reporter heard a firefighter exclaim, "These vehicles should be thrown in the garbage!"</p>
<p>This reporter quickly followed the sound to the vicinity of the Shanghai Grand Theater. At that time, the old shop houses opposite the theater were already engulfed in flames. A pumper truck from the Taishan District was parked on the side road of the theater, drawing water to extinguish the fire. The firefighters were exceptionally brave, some standing in front of the windows, some perched atop telephone poles, and some climbing on the rooftops, using flashlights as guides to direct the flames. However, because the northwest wind was strong last night, the fire borrowed the wind's power, and the shop houses downwind quickly spread despite the pouring water, threatening to get out of control.</p>
<p>At the time, the fire scene was surrounded by onlookers. The electric lights next to the fire site were still on as usual. About half an hour later, the power lines were cut to avoid accidents. The fierce flames gradually died down after 9:00 PM, and the fire was completely extinguished around 10:00 PM. After the fire was extinguished, this reporter went to the scene to inspect. The houses in the area were old-style, one-story buildings. The residents were mostly middle- and lower-class, so in addition to building wooden sheds for shops outside the houses, they also built two-story lofts inside the houses, which is very easy to cause fires. The owner of the fire's origin, No. 1130, Yang Jinhua, from Chongming, was 38 years old. He was out when the fire broke out. Only his wife, Yang Lou Shi (31 years old), and son, Yang Zhigang, were lying on the second floor. Yang Lou Shi suffered serious injuries and had been moaning in bed for more than a month. Although she escaped from the fire, her only son, Zhigang, unfortunately died in the fire.</p>
<p>**Abandoning Her Son to Save Her Own Life, She Was Desolate and Heartbroken**</p>
<p>In addition to the total destruction of the Yongkang Paint Store, the neighboring stores that suffered were Nos. 1132, 1134, 1128, and 1126, including a pancake shop, a fried goods shop, and a beef shop. Except for Nos. 1130, 1132, and 1134, which were completely destroyed, the other two only had their lofts destroyed.</p>
<p>After learning that Yang Lou Shi, the owner of the paint store, was lying on the second floor of the Shanghai Grand Theater, this reporter went forward to interview her. Yang Lou Shi was lying on a sofa in the lobby of the second floor of the Shanghai Grand Theater, covered with a quilt, her face charred yellow. Her right hand, exposed outside the quilt, had been burned, and her legs were also seriously injured. This reporter asked her about the fire. She replied sadly: "When the fire broke out, the family was having dinner upstairs. Only I and my son were lying on the second-floor loft. The fire started downstairs. When my young son, Zhigang, noticed it, I struggled to get up. Although I wanted to hug my son and escape together, I was too weak and unable to pick him up, and the fire was gradually approaching. I had no choice but to abandon my son to save my own life, and the tragic cries of my son were still heard in the flames." Yang Lou Shi almost burst into tears as she spoke. She only had one son and one daughter. Now that her son had been burned to death, it was truly tragic. Yang Lou Shi was then helped by her relatives to the hospital for treatment. Yang Zhigang's body was also dug out by the firefighters, his body charred black, a terrible sight.</p>
<p>**Firefighters' Underwear Soaked with Water**</p>
<p>Last night, the fire brigades participating in the fire fighting included the Taishan District, Xinzha District, and Fahua District teams. A total of four fire engines arrived at the scene and put in a lot of effort to extinguish the fire. This reporter witnessed firefighter Gao Zhan standing on the cloud ladder and rescuing the fire for an hour. According to the Taishan District Captain Xu, all the firefighters who participated in the fire fighting had their underwear soaked. He himself was wearing a new suit to watch a soccer game and rushed back to the team after receiving the alarm, not having time to change clothes, resulting in a great loss. This reporter saw that although the leather hoses used by the fire brigade were broken, they were still usable, so the fire was quickly extinguished. After the fire was extinguished, a team of auxiliary police rushed to the scene. As for the cause of the fire, there are various rumors, some saying it started from a kerosene stove, and some saying it started from a broken electric wire. The police are currently investigating.</p>
<p>**Shacks Burned Down at the End of Gongping Road**</p>
<p>In the open space along the end of Gongping Road and Shaohong Road, there were many shacks built by the poor. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, due to careless cooking, a spark fell and the fire spread rapidly in an instant. Fortunately, the fire brigade received the news and arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, resulting in the burning down of four shacks.</p>

<h3>Due to Material Difficulties, Cigarette Packaging No Longer Uses Tin Foil</h3>
<p>Recently, after the government's regulations on foreign exchange settlement restrictions, the prices of cigarette packaging materials, such as the tin foil inside and the printed paper on the outer box, have skyrocketed and are not easy to purchase in large quantities, which has greatly affected the production of various factories. It is learned that the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association, in view of this, convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures, and unanimously decided that all factories will temporarily stop using tin foil. For those that are sold to other cities and need moisture-proof packaging, they will use wax paper and domestic products instead. The above resolution has been notified to members by the association for compliance in order to reduce the burden on customers.</p>

Our country fought for eight years in the Anti-Japanese War, sacrificing countless lives and property, in order to obtain an equal international position. How can there be heartless and crazy people who sing the fallacy of international intervention and spread heresies, which makes people's hair stand on end? The comrades are indignant and have to refute it strictly. Therefore, based on conscience, we put forward the following five points. All Chinese people should rise up together to save the country from danger. (1) No foreign forces are allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs! (2) We swear not to allow the Yalta Conference to be repeated! (3) Any international conference must have China's participation! (4) Recover all lost territories! (5) All foreign troops must withdraw from China! Faculty members of National Fudan University."</p>

<h3>The Good Shepherd Convent Shelter for Destitute Girls Teaches Them Literacy and Skills to Become Good Working Women</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] There seem to be many relief organizations in Shanghai, but shelters for girls are rare. Among these few, the Good Shepherd Convent Shelter at 910 Route Tenant is one, and it is one of the better-equipped. It has been established for fourteen years, but few people outside know about it. In these difficult times, the nuns in the convent have to appeal for the sake of the one hundred and fifteen girls, and more in the future.</p>
<p>The girls sheltered by the Good Shepherd Convent Shelter range in age from eight or nine to twenty-one or twenty-two. They are sent by parents from poor families or by people from the church. Some children have unclear family backgrounds, and no one wants to take them in, and schools also refuse them. The kind nuns take on the responsibility of educating them. The convent does not want to take in girls who are too old, because they fear that their already-formed bad habits will easily influence the younger generation. At the same time, due to a lack of funds and few workers, they cannot temporarily take in infants. Their main goal is to cultivate a group of women who can read and do housework, so that they can become virtuous housewives or self-reliant working women in the future.</p>
<p>Choosing Spouses for Girls When They Grow Up</p>
<p>When the girls grow up, the nuns will choose a loyal and honest husband for them. They must first investigate whether the other party's parents-in-law can like their daughter-in-law. At the same time, because they are all Catholics, the people they marry are also Catholics.</p>
<p>The director of the shelter, Nun Frances, has served in the convent for twelve years. The girls under her guidance are all very capable. In their spare time, they learn knitting, embroidery, and lace-making. Because the production is not large, they cannot be officially sold yet. In addition to the director nun, there are nine American nuns, and one Chinese and one American nun are currently studying new methods of managing shelters at the Good Shepherd Convent in Los Angeles, and will soon return to China. In addition, there are five students from Qiming Girls' High School in the convent. They are enthusiastic about public welfare and voluntarily serve as teachers in the convent.</p>
<p>Funding Comes Entirely from Donations</p>
<p>In addition to the twelve students whose parents subsidize a portion of their tuition, the rest are homeless and helpless girls. The convent never forces them to leave. Many girls do not want to leave when they reach the age when they should get married, preferring to do more handicrafts inside. The nuns treat them like their own daughters. The funding for the shelter does not have a fixed source. In addition to the occasional generous donations from a few benevolent people from the church, Mayor Wu's wife donated two million yuan, and the General Relief Administration donated some flour and blankets. Usually, a nun goes to the streets to solicit donations from benevolent people. The children eat white steamed buns or yellow rice for each meal, and four people always share one dish. In the past, they often asked the American military service club for leftover cabbage, but now that source has also been cut off, and they have to buy it themselves. When the reporter finished the tour and said goodbye, the director nun sincerely and frankly said to the reporter: "We most hope that people can donate some food and some money for us to use to repair the house, because the house is old and often needs to be repaired, and the cost is conceivable!"</p>

<h3>Warmth Permeates Shanghai Prison as Inmates' Families Bring Food; Crowds of Men, Women, Old and Young Gather in Front of the Gate Two Days a Week; They Face Each Other in Silence for a Short Ten Minutes, Only Shedding Tears</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] High walls, heavy iron gates, narrow cages in individual squares, imprisoning active lives. This gray, huge building, Shanghai Prison, the spring breeze seems to never blow in. However, there are exceptions. On the days when meals are delivered to the prison on Tuesdays and Fridays, it can be considered a ray of warm spring breeze permeating the prison!</p>
<p>Only Vegetables Allowed, No Rice</p>
<p>At the break of dawn, the family members of the prisoners lined up in front of the small iron gate on the right hand side of Shanghai Prison, men and women, old and young, including no small number of family members of "high-ranking officials and wealthy people", fashionable modern girls holding food boxes in their hands. (It is usually said "delivering prison food", but in reality, only vegetables are allowed, not rice.) What are they sending? According to the prison's regulations, there are the following types: Food: Salted meat, salted fish, cooked fresh meat, cooked ham, pork floss, chicken floss, salted eggs, dried vegetables, seaweed, pickled mustard tuber, Chinese pickled cabbage, spring onion tops, pickles, dried snacks, sweets. Items: Soap, towels, toothpaste (powder), toothbrushes, shorts, single-layered shirts and trousers, sanitary shirts and trousers.</p>
<p>Delivery in Order of Number</p>
<p>Delivery of items is based on the delivery permit, and visitation is based on the visitation permit. Those who have not been sentenced by the High Court can only send items and cannot visit, to prevent collusion. Only the family members of those who have been sentenced can visit on time, line up to enter, and tie the food items in cloth bundles or mesh bags. The guards call out the numbers in order and hand over the food items to the guards. These delicacies prepared by the wives and daughters of the prisoners, like the spring breeze, permeate the solemn iron windows, giving the prisoners a little warmth and comfort. After the prisoners receive the food items, the empty food boxes are sent out by the guards, calling out the numbers, and the family members take them back. In this way, the work of "delivering prison food" is completed.</p>
<p>Where to Begin with a Thousand Words?</p>
<p>Visiting prisoners requires a visitation permit. The location for the conversation is the key room, and the conversation time is limited to ten minutes. In these short ten minutes, with a thousand words, one doesn't know where to begin. Some face each other in silence, only shedding tears. When the time is up, they walk out with a bag of tears, only to realize that the important words have not been said!</p>
<p>Some family members stare at the narrow cages in the distant high-rise buildings, and the prisoners also look out through the iron windows, expressing their feelings through various gestures when their eyes meet.</p>
<p>A Russian Woman Blows a Kiss</p>
<p>A Russian woman stares intently at her husband in the rehabilitation center and blows a kiss. Although separated by a high wall of law, their love still merges their spirits together. After 4:00 PM, the family members who "delivered prison food" returned with empty food boxes one by one. The gray high-rise buildings, the gray cement corridors, and the gray prisoners imprisoned in the narrow cages, returned to their gray silence.</p>

<h3>Several South American Merchant Ships Prohibited from Entering Customs</h3>

Because the countries to which these merchant ships belonged did not have a commercial treaty with our country, they were ordered to be prohibited from entering the port. It is reported that these merchant ships are currently requesting permission from our government to enter the port.</p>

<h3>Wife of Drug Trafficking Ring Leader Swallows Gold Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>

Because the ringleader, Xu Guangfu, had not yet returned from the Northeast, only the ringleader's concubine and Sheng Chun, an accomplice, were arrested. At that time, the concubine, Yang Qiu'e, was pregnant and about to give birth, so she was temporarily handed over to the Baojia chief for supervision. The ringleader's wife, Guan Sanmei, and Sheng Chun were being handed over to the Garrison Headquarters at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, but unexpectedly, in the waiting room, Guan Sanmei forcefully folded a gold bracelet weighing eight mace on her arm and swallowed it when people were not paying attention.

<h3>New Regulations for Housing Rental Ordinance? Subtenants Without Leases Require Written Consent from the Secondary Landlord</h3>
<p>Regarding the housing rental ordinance, it is heard that the authorities have new regulations. For subtenants who have already moved in but do not have a lease, they must obtain written consent from the secondary landlord to be valid. A certain lawyer told a reporter that if this clause is applied to Shanghai in the future, it will cause panic. In this city's customs, the rental relationship between secondary landlords and subtenants is generally not based on written contracts. If the aforementioned regulations are implemented, then most secondary landlords will definitely not issue this written consent without demanding a new tip, and will even use it as a talisman to force subtenants to move out, solicit new tenants, and extort tips.</p>
<p>In order to increase the efficiency of postal delivery between Shanghai and Nanjing, the city's post office has set up five special mailboxes in the city area.

<h3>Zhengda University Strike</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Jiangxi, Liu Zao</p>
<p>A Martial Drama with Flying Bricks - Principal Xiao's Head Was Injured!</p>
<p>"We want a president," "We want professors," "We want books"... These slogans have been constantly found at National Chung Cheng University. However, Principal Xiao has traveled to Chongqing and to Beijing and Shanghai to deal with this problem, but he has encountered many difficulties and has not been able to achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Recently, Principal Xiao talked about the process of enriching the school's content at a student meeting. He knew that although he had overcome all kinds of difficulties and obtained some instruments, books, and professors, the school's internal resources were very poor. The only microscope available was borrowed, and the machines in the civil engineering department's practice factory were also borrowed from private sources. This caused the young students, who had a strong desire for knowledge, to bury their suffering in their hearts. Therefore, the calls for "We want a president," "We want professors,"... were deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Zhengda student.</p>
<p>Cai Fangyin, director of the Civil Engineering Department, had some unpleasant feelings with Principal Xiao due to three issues. The reasons were: (1) Professor Cai had a collection of structural mechanics books and signed a contract with the school in Taihe for standby use, but these valuable rare books were lost during the wartime relocation. Professor Cai had requested compensation from the school based on the contract. (2) Part of the machinery in the Civil Engineering Department's machine factory was Professor Cai's private property. He recently requested its return. (3) Professor Cai was one of the founders of Zhengda in Taihe and was also the dean of the College of Engineering. After Xiao took over as president, he reappointed Cai as the director and professor of the Civil Engineering Department. Cai is currently the director of the Industrial Technology Office of the Xingan General Branch, and his duties are busy. He has requested the president to grant him retirement in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, but the Ministry of Education believes that there is a shortage of professors and instructed Principal Xiao to express his condolences and persuade him to stay. Professor Cai had expressed his intention to resign due to the above reasons.</p>
<p>After learning of this news, the students of the Civil Engineering Department believed that the candidate for the dean of the College of Engineering had not been determined, and the director of the department was also about to resign, which was a huge crisis for everyone's academic future. Therefore, on the night of the 17th of this month, the students of the Civil Engineering Department marched in teams, shouting: "We want a president," "We want a department director," "We want professors," "Retain Dean Cai,"... The marching ranks arrived at the faculty and staff residential area, awakening Director Wu Shidong. Wu tried to dissuade them at the scene but failed. At about 10:00 a.m. on the 18th, representatives of the students of the Civil Engineering Department went to see Principal Xiao again, requesting that Professor Cai Fangyin be retained. Principal Xiao expressed that he had not heard of Cai's resignation. He said: If there is such a thing, the school will sincerely try to persuade him to stay. While the representatives were talking with the president, the students of the department were gathering outside the door and making noise. Director Wu tried to dissuade them at the scene, but some students shouted to fight, and some refused to leave. Principal Xiao came out of the room to stop them. After admonishing them face-to-face, they dispersed.</p>
<p>This commotion foreshadowed the beginning of the student strike. At about 3:00 p.m., the students of the third and sixth grades and the third and eighth grades of the College of Engineering's Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department also issued some slogans of "We want professors" and "We want libraries." Some impatient students even shouted the slogan "The school should not be bureaucratic." The incident gradually expanded, and the fire of the student strike had already been ignited in the school. The students of the College of Science marched in teams again on the evening of the 18th, at about 10:00 p.m., and went to Principal Xiao's residence to petition. They demanded the hiring of more professors and the addition of books and instruments. After Principal Xiao told the petitioning students of the College of Science about the hard work he had put in planning, the matter was settled peacefully.</p>
<p>At about 11:00 p.m. that night, another group of students shouted the slogans "Down with Xiao!" and "Strike tomorrow!" When the crazy ranks passed by the principal's residence, Principal Xiao called the students to gather and give a speech, but they refused to listen. Bricks flew around, and Principal Xiao's head was injured by the flying rocks at this time. A student in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department also fell and injured his head because he could not run away in time when the school workers dispersed the crowd. Meetings, marches, shouting slogans,... lasted all day - the 18th - the student strike was formed in these riots.</p>
<p>Although the professors went to class on time on the morning of the 19th, some students automatically missed classes. The overall student request for leave started from the 20th. They decided to take an oath at the general assembly of the entire school held at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th that they would not cancel the leave until the goal was achieved, and they would hold a chain guarantee. More than eight-tenths of the students signed their names, echoing this "overall request for leave." And each of the four colleges and 54 tea grades elected one representative to organize the "National Chung Cheng University Department-Level Joint School Protection Movement Committee." Each of the four colleges and specialized courses elected one representative to organize the presidium. They unanimously resolved to request: Principal Xiao's resignation, a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Education, and Director Xiong Tianyi, requesting approval of Principal Xiao's resignation, and sending a declaration to all colleges and universities in the country. Now the person in charge of the school protection movement stated that the collective leave will be extended until Principal Xiao's resignation is approved.</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 19th, after the student strike, Principal Xiao convened a meeting of all faculty and staff and reported on the incident and his attitude toward the incident. He decided to be responsible until the 20th of this month. From the 21st, the school affairs will be temporarily handled by the school affairs committee. After hearing this news, all the faculty and staff were very sorry. During the faculty and staff meeting, it was decided to elect representatives to comfort Principal Xiao and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to earnestly persuade Principal Xiao to stay. The professors also stated that they would not resume classes until the students realized their mistakes and requested to resume classes and the academic affairs office notified them.</p>
<p>Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongcui and Director Wu Shidong of the student affairs believed that the occurrence of the student strike had been brewing for quite some time, but there was no excuse to borrow. On the eve of this big exam, some professors intended to resign and took the opportunity to incite the students. This was also the painstaking effort of the "wire pullers." As for the resignation of Professor Cai Fangyin, there was no prior notice. Regarding the hiring of professors, they had already been invited separately, either because the term of other schools had expired, or they were still stranded abroad, so they were still lacking. Because Principal Xiao held a secret and refused to abuse the attitude, and the students' course selection reached 18 points and 20 points, and some even exceeded them. The courses were opened slowly, leaving only politics, animal husbandry, and physical mathematics courses, and they could all be made up in a certain period. This is not a false statement, and the course schedule and course selection form can be used for comparison. The so-called academics and homework are all remarks against one's will that are made out of loss of reason.</p>
<p>Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi also guaranteed with his personality that his words were not false.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of Principal Xiao being injured by a stone, according to what Wu and Luo personally witnessed, the situation at the time was extremely serious. The students went back and forth repeatedly, as if they had to put Principal Xiao to death. After Principal Xiao was injured, he was moved indoors, and the broken stones were still thrown in from the windows, and he was cursed with vicious voices: "Xiao is a bastard."</p>
<p>Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi said: If the students of Zhengda do not repent in time and expand the storm, it will inevitably lead to a decisive action by the authorities. (Sent from Nanchang on February 26)</p>

<h3>Eight Battles, Eight Victories: Tung Wah Yesterday Defeated Yu Yu Again, A Rather Wonderful 2-0 Kick</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Tung Wah team continued to maintain its winning streak in the First Division Football League, defeating Yu Yu 2-0 yesterday, achieving a great record of eight wins in eight games. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw. The First Division Championship is now firmly in their grasp. Despite the fierce wind yesterday, there were still over 6,000 fans in attendance. The game was quite exciting. The battle unfolded as follows:</p>
<p>Mutual Offense and Defense</p>
<p>At 3:10 PM, the two teams lined up, with referee Deng Xiaoliang and linesmen Zhang Le and Chen Jixiang. The whistle blew to start the game. Tung Wah, playing against the wind, launched the first attack. Long Hai, A Sun, and Mingzhe advanced together. Yu Yu's Chen Xiaoping and Yun Feng parried left and right. In the fifth minute, Cao Qinfang launched a surprise attack, which Zhang Banglun caught squarely. Tung Wah seized the opportunity to attack. Jia Youliang orchestrated an offensive, taking a long-range shot from 30 yards out. Zhang Rongcai leaped to save it, but fumbled, and the ball bounced off the crossbar, narrowly avoiding a goal. Shortly after, Tung Wah's five forwards advanced, and Yu Yu's territory was entirely controlled by Tung Wah. Luo Xulai committed a foul 18 yards from the goal, and Sun Lojin took the penalty, but missed. Tung Wah attacked relentlessly for quite some time. Three minutes before the end of the first half, Zhu Meilong took a corner kick, and Bama shot powerfully, but it landed squarely in Banglun's arms, avoiding disaster. The first half ended with a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>Two Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the battle with the same lineup. After the kickoff, Yu Yu launched an attack, but Tung Wah's Zhang Lingen and Han Longbo resisted strongly. In the second minute, Jia Youliang advanced on the right flank and passed the ball to the center. Chen Mingzhe met it with a kick, and the ball landed in front of the goal. Han Longhai arrived in time to gently flick it into the net. Tung Wah took the lead 1-0. After losing the first goal, Yu Yu was unwilling to give up. Bama led the four forwards in a rapid advance. Dian Shuping dribbled past Zhuang Youren and took a powerful shot near the goal. The shot was swift and fierce. Zhang Banglun remained calm and collected, punching the ball out for a corner. Zhu Longmei took the corner, but it came to nothing. In the 18th minute of the melee, Jia Youliang attacked again. Zhang Rongcai got the ball but fumbled. Han Longhai rushed forward and kicked it into the net, making it 2-0 for Tung Wah. Yu Yu, determined to retaliate, launched a desperate counterattack, but Tung Wah's defense was tight and impenetrable, and they were unable to succeed. Before the final whistle, Tung Wah defeated Yu Yu again 2-0, creating a great record of eight wins in eight games. The First Division Championship is now firmly in their grasp.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball: Xuebai Wins Second Place, Qinglian Resists, Left With Only Four Players, Forfeits; Chunmao Defeats Encas</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Last night's basketball league featured one women's game and two Group A First Division games. The audience was enthusiastic, numbering no less than five or six hundred people. In the women's game, Xuebai and Qinglian competed for second place. Xuebai was outstanding. At 26 minutes and 30 seconds into the fourth quarter, the score was 22-19. Only four Qinglian players remained due to fouls. Under women's rules, the game could not continue, so Xuebai won by forfeit, 2-0. In the Group A First Division, Chunmao defeated Encas 38-30 in the first game. The two sides engaged in physical play, with stiff movements. In the second game, the Navy &amp; Army Youth League's defense was impenetrable, and they won a decisive victory over the Railway Jing, with a score of 75-39, a significant difference. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xuebai Wins Against Qinglian</p>
<p>In the women's competition for second place, all three Xuebai forwards were taller than the Qinglian defenders. Zhang Xiuli made both free throws, Zhu Jiazhen scored, and Zhang scored again, giving them a dominant lead of seven points. Qinglian relied on Sun Fengzhu and Liu Huishan to score. In the first quarter, Xuebai held a 7-3 advantage.</p>
<p>Liu Huishan added two points, and Sun made one free throw, narrowing the gap to just one point (7-6). Xuebai's Wang Shan entered the game, replacing Zhu Jiazhen, making the team even more coordinated. Zhu Jiazhen, in her bright sweater, stood out like "a red flower among the green." She also had the posture to be on camera. In the second quarter, Xiuli scored four points, Wang Huiling two, and the late-arriving Wang Shan four, while Qinglian's Sun scored one free throw and Liu made two free throws. The second quarter ended 16-6.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, with the score at 21-7, Qinglian adjusted its formation, sending Li Huizhen to the front line and recalling Zhu Lanzhen to defense. At 27-7, Lanzhen fouled out, leaving only five players. With two forwards and three defenders, eight minutes passed with the score at 30-7.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, at 6 minutes and 30 seconds, with three and a half minutes remaining, the score was 32-9. Wang Wenzhu fouled out, leaving Qinglian with only four players. According to the rules, the game could not continue, so all records were erased, and Xuebai won against Qinglian by 2-0.</p>
<p>Chunmao Wins Against Encas</p>
<p>In the first Group A First Division game, Chunmao played against Encas. At the start, Chunmao scored four consecutive points. Soon after, Encas tied the score at 6-6. He Hanfu made a free throw, giving Chunmao a one-point lead. Ge Pengqi tied the score again (8 points). This guy had a particularly fierce eating habit. With a thrust of his stomach, he could bounce people several steps away. Liu Fushen scored two baskets, giving Chunmao a 12-8 lead. Huang Tianlie entered, replacing Chen Jiabiao, increasing the score to 16-9. At this time, Fushen had already scored 11 points. Before the buzzer, he scored another basket, giving Chunmao a 19-9 lead at halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, Chunmao's Hanfu, Fushen, Li Xianzheng, and others scored. Encas worked hard to strengthen themselves. Ge Pengqi, Ge Fu, and Kailuosi suddenly increased their score to sixteen, but it was still difficult to stop Chunmao's momentum. The result was 38-30.</p>
<p>Chunmao Throw Free Foul Points</p>
<p>Huang Tianlie 1 1 2 3</p>

<p>Navy &amp; Army Youth League Wins Against Railway Jing</p>
<p>In the battle between the Navy &amp; Army Youth League and the Railway Jing, Railway's Hu Sishen scored first, but Buruka Furulu's marvelous shots allowed the Navy &amp; Army Youth League to rise rapidly. Railway relied on Yang Xianji to maintain the situation. In the first half, the Navy &amp; Army Youth League led 34-20.</p>
<p>After the break, the "foreign soldiers" showed their power, surging forward and scoring 21 consecutive points (55-24). The other side only scored four points. The former's victory was due to its tight joint defense, making it difficult for Railway to break through and score close shots. The result was 75-39.</p>
<p>Navy &amp; Army Youth League Fouls Points</p>
<p>Buruka 1 18</p>
<p>Bishi Bei 0 2</p>

<p>Gu Zhenhua 4 2</p>
<p>Jiang Guoyu 0 11</p>
<p>Gao Zemin 0 2</p>
<p>Total 13 39</p>
<h3>Notes from the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>Of the three basketball league games last night, only Chunmao's victory over Encas was relatively exciting. Huang Tianlie returned to the court after recovering from illness, making Chunmao's offense more active and allowing them to control the game. In the second half, they created a significant score difference of 26-13.</p>
<p>Liu Fushen maintained his usual high performance in every game. In yesterday's game, Fushen's positioning was accurate, and his long-range and close-range shots were all on target. He was the most outstanding player.</p>
<p>Since Bote left, Encas has lost a mid-range shooter, which is an irreparable loss. However, their stamina and fighting spirit have not diminished, and they are still promising. Last night, Encas was too overconfident and failed to focus on tightly guarding Fushen, which was a mistake.</p>
<p>He Hufu also worked hard. Xianzheng and Fuqiang defended tirelessly, preventing Encas from having many opportunities to follow up under the basket. Tianlie's performance was inconsistent, and he and Zheng Biao alternated on the court.</p>
<p>Baolai and E Kailuosi were the two most competent players for Encas, but the team's movements were still somewhat rough.</p>
<p>Five minutes before the end of the game, Fushen was knocked to the ground and left the court with an injury. He returned shortly after, stabilizing the situation.</p>
<p>After Fushen committed four fouls in the first half, he acted cautiously. If Fushen had fouled out, victory would not have belonged to Chunmao. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>New and Old Governors of the Central Bank to Hand Over Today, Bei Zuyi Held a Final Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the National Government specially appointed Zhang Jia as the Governor of the Central Bank on the 1st, it was heard that Zhang will come to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Nanjing train this morning and is expected to assume office at the Central Bank at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has decided to hold a tea party at 4:00 PM today at its office at No. 15 Bund to entertain the heads of various agencies in the city and leaders of the financial community. At the same time, the handover ceremony between the new and old governors will be held.</p>
<p>After Bei Zuyi's resignation as Governor of the Central Bank was approved, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning with his secretary, Lu Dingzhong. Bei immediately went to the Central Bank to work. At around 10:00 AM, he convened a meeting of the heads of various departments to discuss the handover. Bei instructed the departments to complete their closing procedures yesterday in preparation for the handover today.</p>
<p>According to Lu Dingzhong of the Central Bank Secretariat, Bei has a history of lung disease and submitted his resignation in September last year, which was not approved. He has now earnestly requested the highest authorities to resign again and has finally been approved. Bei plans to go to Beiping for rest after the handover is completed and will not take up any new positions for the time being. Lu then showed reporters Bei's earnest letter to Chairman Chiang, which reads as follows: "Respectfully submitting this, I, Zuyi, was ordered to take over the Central Bank at the end of February 1946. Due to my lung disease, I requested a trial period of six months and submitted my resignation in early September, which was not approved. I am deeply grateful for your telegram of condolences and encouragement. I have since temporarily shouldered the heavy responsibility and tried my best to cope, hoping to exhaust my meager abilities to repay your kindness in one ten thousandth part. Half a year has passed since then. My talent cannot compensate for the difficulties and dangers, and my weak body can no longer bear the burden. I am filled with fear and trepidation. After careful consideration, in order to avoid delaying my duties, I earnestly request you to appreciate my sincere intentions and approve my resignation, selecting someone to replace me so that I can rest and recuperate. I will wait for the opportunity to repay your kindness in the future. I am earnestly praying. Respectfully presented to Chairman Chiang, Zuyi Bei respectfully presented, March 1st."</p>
<p>It was also reported that Lin Yinbao, Director of the Business Department of the Central Bank, Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, Xu Xianda, Deputy Director, and Lu Dingzhong and Zhu Kunshou, Secretaries, have submitted their resignations to Bei Zuyi and have been approved. Many other staff members borrowed from the Bank of China also intend to leave. However, the final personnel changes will depend on discussions between the new and old governors, and the new governor will redeploy the staff. It is heard that after the new governor takes office, in order to maintain business continuity, he may temporarily retain Lin Fengbao, Lin Weiying, Xu Xianda, and others until suitable replacements can be found.</p>
<p>It is also said that after Zhang Jia'ao, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, takes over as the new governor, his vacated position of Deputy Governor will be filled by Liu Gongyun. Chen Xing, another Deputy Governor, will remain in his original position.</p>
<h3>The Import Control Committee Actively Reviews the Qualifications of Registered Importers</h3>
<p>Oil Importer Qualifications Approved for 72 Companies</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Import Temporary Management Committee is actively promoting the review of the qualifications of registered importers. It is learned that in addition to the qualifications of importers of oil, rubber, cotton, and wool, the qualifications of importers of nine types of goods, including sulfurized raw materials, indigo, coal and coal briquettes, machine leather belts, burlap bags, rice, wheat, wheat flour, and hemp, have been reviewed. Starting this week, the qualifications of importers of oil waxes, starch, fertilizers, cement, military nitrous acid, and rayon will be investigated separately. During the investigation, in addition to relying on the credit information provided by the designated banks, the importers of each category will be invited to attend meetings or submit missing documents for review.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the committee, the review of the qualifications of importers is quite heavy. The review is based on the Customs Tariff. Each tariff has a standard, which is based on the business volume of direct imports by each importer in 1946. However, each tariff often contains multiple commodities. For example, the item "hardware" lists as many as 84 types of goods, and an importer often engages in the import of multiple commodities. To be fair and practical, it is necessary to review each item one by one to see if it meets the standard. Therefore, although only 3,000 registration applications have been submitted by importers in the city, the actual review work is equivalent to reviewing 40,000 to 50,000 applications. Therefore, the delay and time-consuming nature of the review work is due to this. However, as a result of active promotion, the qualifications of importers of 25 types of quota-limited imported materials have been mostly reviewed.</p>
<p>[Also reported] It is learned that a total of 72 importers have obtained oil import qualifications. Among them, 30 are for kerosene, 7 for gasoline, 7 for lubricating oil, 15 for fuel oil, and 13 for lubricating oil.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Factory Federation Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Quotas</h3>
<p>Since the government implemented the import control policy, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation has hoped to relax the import quotas of raw materials in order to increase production. After convening several discussions with member factories, collecting opinions from all parties, and formulating reasons, they requested the Import Control Committee to approve the adoption. According to Cheng Shouzhong, the person in charge of the association, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The raw material needs of all member factories in the association vary greatly due to different business natures. If the Import Control Committee imposes quota allocations on the import of industrial raw materials, the first step in the allocation must be to first investigate the existing power equipment of various factories and accurately estimate the amount of raw materials required for each machine and the amount of finished products that can be produced. Then, the allocated quota is approved, so that production can be increased, prices can be stabilized, and national industries can be supported.</p>
<p>(2) The Import Control Committee should expedite the approval of foreign exchange settlement applications for imported goods to facilitate the export of industrial products and avoid factory shutdowns, which would waste daily expenses.</p>
<p>(3) The Import Control Committee should carefully classify imported raw materials and finished products. After the quota is allocated, the quantity is necessary for each factory. If the quantity of imported finished products is included in the quota, the scope of raw material quotas will be reduced.</p>
<p>(4) The first priority for revitalizing national industries after the war is to fully supply raw materials. If raw materials are in short supply, survival will be difficult and development will be impossible. Therefore, this investigation is extremely important. If the investigation can be conducted first, the quota allocation will also be more practical. If manpower is difficult to oversee for a time, the authorities can transfer the order to various people's organizations to jointly assist in the handling.</p>
<h3>Private Transactions of Gold Are Difficult to Completely Eliminate</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the central government promulgated the ban on gold trading, the black market for gold has disappeared, but private, small-scale transactions have not been completely eliminated. When reporters asked the mayor about this, the mayor did not deny it and said that he had told President Song some days ago that although the gold ban had been promulgated, black market transactions were still feared to be unstoppable. President Song asked why, and he gave an example: Suppose A brings a gold bar to B's house and borrows 5.7 million yuan from B. This act is not a crime and cannot be detected by the military police, but a black market transaction has already been constituted. Regarding this private transaction, the mayor said that it would be difficult to completely eliminate it for a while.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Revival Loan Limited to Repayment Within Two Years</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently established a loan of US$5 million with the Bank of China to revive the Taiwan sugar industry. The loan is limited to repayment within two years. It is heard that the company has also obtained approval from the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange at the official exchange rate at the time of repayment in the future. It is understood that the main purpose of the loan is to order a large number of sugar factory machines and transportation railway equipment from the United States. Now that the loan has been secured, all of the equipment is expected to be shipped to Taiwan in batches before August and September of this year. Therefore, the sugar production plan for the end of this year and the spring of next year, which is to transport 3 million tons of sugarcane and produce 300,000 tons of sugar, will be achieved as scheduled.</p>
<h3>New Flour Prices to Be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>The adjustment of flour prices has been approved by Mayor Wu and will be officially implemented today. The new adjusted prices are: (1) Lilang flour, 70 pounds per bag, 70,000 yuan per bag; (2) Local flour, 40 pounds per bag, 47,000 yuan per bag. These new prices will not be adjusted again within the next three months. If the price exceeds the limit, the offenders will be severely punished in accordance with the price-fixing regulations.</p>
<p>(Also reported) The municipal government has scheduled a meeting of flour merchants within days to discuss the distribution of foreign flour arriving in Shanghai and government subsidies to flour mills.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Factories Re-evaluated and Sold by Tender in Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The China Trust Bureau's Property Liquidation Office is currently re-evaluating enemy property, and factory parts will be announced for sale by tender in the near future. Relevant sources said that prices have fluctuated sharply in the past six months, and the valuation from last fall is no longer appropriate. Among the remaining enemy and puppet materials, real estate accounts for the main position. The estimate last fall was already worth 200 billion yuan, and it is now far more than this figure. Among the real estate, some of the buildings are used for aircraft, and sales should be easiest. Another part has been allocated to influential people for residence, and compensation should not be a problem. The most problematic are the alley houses, which are occupied by more than one household. The competent authorities hope to trade collectively to save procedures. If this is not possible, they will contact the tenants individually to sell. As for the remaining factories, most of them are dilapidated and of little value.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Investigates Wartime Silk Industry Losses: 200,000 Metric Tons of Silk and 2 Billion Mulberry Trees Lost; Silk Industry Equipment Losses Valued at 300 Million Pre-War Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Our country is one of the world's major sericultural nations, with silk being a major export commodity and a primary source of foreign exchange. During the War of Resistance, the silk-producing areas in the Northeast, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces, which were occupied, accounted for 90% of the national total. Moreover, farmland in the occupied areas was left barren, and the damage to the foundations of breeding farms and silk mills made it difficult to restore production to pre-war levels even after six years. Before the war, our country's annual silk production could reach 100,000 to 150,000 metric tons, but currently it is only 15,000 metric tons, which demonstrates the severity of the destruction. Japan's silk production, except for a small portion for domestic use, is mostly for export, and Japan currently has a large stock of cocoons. Therefore, using these as compensation for our country's wartime losses would be most appropriate. Our delegation in Japan is continuing to make every effort to argue this point.</p>
<p>Investigating National Silk Losses</p>
<p>The China Silk Corporation has specifically organized the "National Silk Losses Investigation Committee During the War of Resistance." Sun Bohe and six others have been appointed as members to conduct a nationwide investigation. The scope includes: (1) silk farmers, (2) mulberry gardens, (3) breeding farms, (4) cocoon markets, (5) silk mills, and (6) losses of relevant silk-related organizations, schools, and societies. The investigation content includes: (1) direct losses of building equipment, (2) direct losses of manufactured products, (3) cumulative indirect business losses over the years, (4) cumulative losses due to control and price suppression over the years, and (5) losses during the repatriation period (including increased burdens on the national treasury and the people). The investigation covers the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Shandong. Major reports from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other provinces have already been received and will be compiled into a general report to be submitted to the Central Compensation Committee.</p>
<p>Astonishing Losses in China's Silk Industry</p>
<p>According to estimates by the China Silk Corporation, China's wartime losses in the silk industry are as follows: (A) Silk production losses: (1) Domestic silkworm silk production loss of 1,603,000 metric tons, (2) Wild silkworm silk production loss of 400,000 metric tons, totaling 1,003,000 metric tons. (B) Equipment losses: (1) 2,600,000 sericultural households suffered losses, with a total value of 236,000,000 yuan. (2) Seed production reduced by 4,600,000 sheets, with a total loss of 10,900,000 yuan. (3) Silk reeling industry lost 45,000 silk reeling machines, with a total loss of 28,100,000 yuan. (4) Other losses totaled 2,500,000 yuan. The total equipment losses (in pre-war legal tender value) amounted to 300,000,000 yuan. (C) Mulberry garden abandonment losses: (1) 2,180,000 mu of mulberry gardens were abandoned, resulting in the loss of 1,132,000,000 mulberry trees. (2) 5,360,000 mu of mulberry gardens were damaged, requiring the replenishment and renewal of 868,000,000 trees. The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2,000,000,000.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Pleads for the Jewelry Industry; Suggests Allowing the Buying and Selling of Gold Jewelry; Feasibility Subject to Central Government Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the central government issued the ban on gold trading, the livelihood of the jewelry industry has been cut off. Representatives have petitioned the municipal government several times, claiming that Mayor Wu, as the "father and mother official" of the city's residents, would be willing to alleviate the difficulties of those in the jewelry industry. They earnestly requested that Mayor Wu, in addition to submitting a written report, also make an oral appeal to the authorities, which Mayor Wu promised to do. Upon Mayor Wu's return to Shanghai from Beijing, reporters specifically visited him to inquire whether the future of the jewelry industry had been discussed during his time in Beijing. He replied that he had indeed made an urgent appeal on their behalf and had suggested a concrete solution to Chairman Chiang, namely, to allow the free buying and selling of gold jewelry. Jewelry stores could directly purchase jewelry from citizens and freely sell jewelry to citizens, but they would be absolutely prohibited from buying and selling gold bars or selling the jewelry they purchased after melting it into bars. In this way, the gold market would not be affected, and the livelihood of the jewelry industry could be maintained. Mayor Wu also stated that this solution had been thoroughly discussed with Minister Yu Hongjun and Deputy Minister Xu, and they all considered it reasonable. Whether this method can be approved awaits consultation by the central government, and a final decision is expected in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Active Trading in Yellow Weasel Pelts</h3>
<p>[Our Report] There has been a significant amount of trading in yellow weasel pelts recently, with overseas market prices frequently increasing. Jewish merchants, in particular, have a strong appetite. The trading price is 36,000 yuan per pair. It is reported that the New York price is approximately US$3.50. Lake sheep pelts, which have not been seen for a long time, have also appeared on the market, with a price of 12,000 yuan per piece. Green sheep pelts are 15,000 yuan per piece, while whole sheep pelts are 16,000 yuan per piece, and white sheep pelts are 17,000 yuan per piece, all up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Trading in all goods is lively, reversing the previous stagnation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cement Factory Preparing to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Shipments Possible in Early April</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Cement Factory is currently preparing to resume operations. Due to the recent shortage of coal, it has decided to convert to diesel engines starting in March. It is estimated that shipments can begin in early April. The factory is still located in Longhua. The first phase of production is currently set at 70,000 pounds. The factory was founded in 1920 and officially started shipping in 1923. It was forced to cease operations after the outbreak of the war. After the victory, it resumed operations, but due to the dumping of foreign goods, sales were lacking, and the difficulty in purchasing coal led to another suspension of operations last month. The factory's cement production was originally second in Shanghai but has now fallen to third place due to various setbacks.</p>
<p>Another report: Among our country's cement factories, those in the north include the Liaoning Cement Factory, Jinxi Cement Factory, and North China Cement Factory, which are affiliated with the Resources Committee. Private enterprises include Qixin Cement Company. Shanxi has the Taiyuan Cement Factory, and the Jiangnan area has the China Cement Factory and the Shanghai Cement Factory. According to a responsible person at Qixin Company, the company's main sales are currently concentrated in the Central China area. North China currently does not need it due to climate conditions. The company's cement shipments to the Nanjing-Shanghai area this month are 7,000 tons, with 90% purchased by the government for use in the Longhai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Nanjing-Shanghai railways. The company's cement production is greater than that of China Cement Company, and the prices are similar. Currently, our country's cement industry, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the main raw material gypsum has increased fivefold compared to before, and packaging materials such as hemp bags and cardboard boxes have also risen sharply. While cement prices have only risen by 20%, the difficulties of dumping of foreign goods have already been overcome, but the difficulty of obtaining raw material coal is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Iron and Steel Company is Ready</h3>
<p>Our country's steel production has historically been abundant in the Northeast. The steel raw materials needed in the Southeast region mostly depend on foreign supply, resulting in huge losses. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, and the steel raw materials required are plentiful. Therefore, it is an urgent task to build the foundation of heavy industry in the Southeast industrial zone and increase steel production. The authorities have made increasing steel production a major goal of current construction. Recently, Liu Gongyun, a leader in the financial sector and director of the Central Trust Bureau, on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, invited Chen Shouchang, Yu Mingyu, and others from the Shanghai steel industry to organize the Shanghai Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. to cooperate with the government's steel production increase plan, build the foundation of heavy industry in Central China, reduce the outflow of funds, inject foreign exchange, and increase employment opportunities. After the shortest period of efforts, the company has been prepared. It is reported that Liu Gongyun has been elected as chairman, and Shen Xirui, Zhang Liment, Chen Shouchang, and Wang Erzhen have been appointed as managing directors. Yu Mingyu has been appointed as the general manager of the company, and Liu Tianhong and Ren Jiakun have been appointed as deputy general managers. Metallurgical expert Tang Zhisu has been hired as the chief engineer, Tang Hanzong as the factory director of the first factory, Yu Enpei as the factory director of the second factory, and Zhu Hengqing as the director of the business department. Currently, the mechanical equipment of the second factory on Huangxing Road has been installed. If there are no problems with the electricity supply, production and shipment can begin next month. It is estimated that large-scale production will be possible in the second half of the year, which is an active and effective remedy in the current crisis of excessive imports and will be of great benefit to the current economic situation.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Rayon to be Decided This Morning</h3>
<p>Regarding the rationing of rayon, a responsible person at the Central Trust Bureau told reporters yesterday that the rationing of rayon to the silk weaving industry will be decided at a meeting this morning, and distribution may begin today or tomorrow. Before the monthly quota is approved, one-fifth of the original quota will be distributed first. They also stated that half of the silk weaving machines have joined the production and sales joint venture company, for which the authorities have already allocated raw materials, so only half need rayon to be rationed. The Bureau will no longer ration to machines that have joined in exporting silk weaves.</p>
<p>Red Rice Rises</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of red rice arrivals and inventory, the market is tight. It is reported that the Shantou price is above 4 customs units, so the Shanghai market price is up by 30-40% or more, and the trend is that prices will rise in the future without falling.</p>
<h3>The Value of the US Dollar in the East</h3>
<p>In Asia, there is more money than goods. As a result, one US dollar today can buy more in the United States than in most countries in the East. The US "World Report Weekly" recently listed and compared the official exchange rates of the US dollar and currencies of various Eastern countries as follows:</p>
<p>China: 12,000 yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 3.95 yuan</p>
<p>Vietnam: 6.99 piastres</p>
<p>Thailand: 9.93 baht</p>
<p>Singapore: 2.12 dollars</p>
<p>Philippines: 2 pesos</p>
<p>Japan: 15 yen</p>
<p>Korea: 5 won</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies: 2.65 guilders</p>
<p>Ceylon: 3.30 rupees</p>
<p>India: 3.30 rupees</p>
<p>Soviet Union: 5.30 rubles</p>
<p>Afghanistan: 13.50 afghanis</p>
<p>Iran: 31.75 rials</p>
<p>Iraq: 0.25 dinars</p>
<p>Turkey: 2.81 pounds</p>
<p>Most of the numbers listed above do not truly represent the actual purchasing power of the currencies of those countries. Black markets exist in all countries because people prefer to hoard stable US dollars. For example, in China, the official exchange rate of the US dollar to legal tender used to be 3,350 yuan, but it has recently been changed to 12,000 yuan. In Iran, the official exchange rate is 31.75 rials, but on the black market, 40 rials are required to exchange for one US dollar. The purchasing power of the US dollar on the black market is probably stronger than at the official exchange rate. One reason is that the amount of currency in circulation in various Eastern countries has greatly increased, while production is still far lower than before the war. As a result, prices have risen to the point where the US dollar can buy less in Asia than it can domestically.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Musk Exports Valued at Over 1 Billion National Currency</h3>
<p>Musk is one of the most important raw materials for making perfume and perfume essences. The best quality musk comes from Xikang Province in our country. Each year a considerable amount is sold. According to statistics, our country exported 3,300 grams of musk last year, worth more than 1 billion yuan in legal tender. However, the actual exports far exceed this number because musk is a valuable item, extremely light, and easy to carry. Therefore, there is a great deal of smuggling, which cannot be counted. The United States absorbs the most musk from our country, accounting for about 80% of exports. Before the war, France's perfume manufacturing industry was developed, and the amount of musk imported from our country was considerable. After the war, it has become greatly diminished. Last year, there were only 80-90 million yuan in transactions.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Treasury Requests Allocation of 10 Billion for Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since its establishment, the Central Cooperative Treasury has successively prepared to set up branches in Huaiyin, Taixian, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Qingdao, Beiping, and other places. Other branches and sub-offices in the pacification areas are also being prepared. The treasury has recently requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate 10 billion yuan for cooperative financial construction to be used for cooperative loans and to guide consumer and production cooperatives in various regions.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Trade is Bartered</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Municipal Government received a telegram from the Northeast Economic Commission stating that after the promulgation of urgent economic measures, the prices of daily necessities have been independently determined by the competent authorities in various regions. Please notify the Grain Industry Association that if they want to purchase soybeans, soybean cakes, etc. from the Northeast, they can use cloth, yarn, sugar, tea, etc. to exchange for the price.</p>
<p>Another report: Demand for cotton production in the Northeast exceeds supply. The Northeast Executive Headquarters Economic Committee recently revised the internal and external trade adjustment measures. The transport regulations related to cotton in the "Permissible Items" stipulate that any cotton entering the customs weighing more than ten kilograms, regardless of the method of consignment, must be approved by the committee.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Table of Foreign Exchange Rate Equivalents</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yazhuang of Huaqiao Bank has compiled a book of equivalent exchange rates for British, American, Hong Kong, Indian, and Dutch currencies. The calculations are accurate and the search is convenient. By citing the exchange rate of any one currency, the market price of the other four can be found. The entire book is 51 pages and is sold at 120 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Tea Tasting Experts</h3>
<p>Seven tea experts in the United States evaluate various imported teas at the US Tea Inspection Office. They have a special sense of discrimination of tea taste and use smell and taste to determine the quality of various teas. The picture shows the experts sitting around a rotating round table, taking turns to evaluate various tea samples.</p>

<h3>Various Aspects of Korean Residents in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>—Shenyang, February 20th (Airmail Report) by our Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Tight-fitting long skirts, small tops, pure white and light red colors, make them bright and vibrant, with a style still reminiscent of ancient times. With the flowing skirt belts, although one cannot say that they are all "graceful and charming", many of them are beautiful. This is the attire of young Korean women. As for Korean patriots and soldiers, the bravery and wisdom they displayed in the Northeast, with blood, tears, and backbone, is an epic history of struggle worth singing and weeping about. Korean farmers are diligent and hardworking, and their enthusiasm and harvest in rice planting are also well-known. Anyone who has been to the Northeast probably appreciates this.</p>
<p>Northeast compatriots have seen the bravery and beauty of the Korean residents, and at the same time, they have also seen the ugliness and filth of another group of people. Those people are sneaky, despicable, barbaric, bully others by relying on their power, and manufacture and sell drugs. Northeast compatriots do not know how much humiliation and harm they have suffered from them. They act arrogantly and make money under the guise of being "elder brothers of the subjugated people."</p>
<p>These degenerate Korean residents poison our Northeast compatriots. Our Northeast compatriots have suffered too much from them. There is no place to appeal for injustice, and no way to assert reason. If the matter is taken to the Japanese government, our compatriots will still suffer, which has caused the people of the Northeast to have a headache and hatred towards the Korean residents. In private, they curse them as "Korean bastards!"</p>
<p>This responsibility should be borne by the Japanese, and it cannot be said that it is entirely the inferiority of the Korean residents. Because the Japanese wanted to make the Koreans an inferior nation and to make them thugs, so that the Japanese could reap the benefits. They also feared the unity of the Korean residents and did divisive work among them, so the current situation of mutual distrust and divergent opinions among the Korean residents was cultivated.</p>
<p>Two Million People</p>
<p>In the past, the number of Korean residents living in the Northeast was quite large. According to the statistics of the puppet Manchuria, there were a total of two million people, accounting for approximately 5% of the total population of the Northeast region. Historical research shows that the history of Koreans residing in the Northeast dates back to hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>At the time of the September 18th Incident, there were 1.5 million Korean residents in the Northeast. They can be divided into three major categories: one is the Korean residents who originally lived on the Sino-Korean border, one is those who fled to the Northeast after Japan annexed Korea, and the third is those who were supported by Japan to immigrate to the Northeast after Japan occupied the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Korean residents are distributed throughout the Northeast region, mostly in the Sino-Korean border area, the Songhua River and Liao River basins, and various large and small cities. 90% of them are farmers, and the rest are engaged in industry and commerce. There are also those who "do evil" and "commit all kinds of crimes."</p>
<p>Most of the Korean residents are farmers, so the rice paddies in the valleys of the Northeast are mostly cultivated by Korean farmers. Most of the rice paddies were forcibly occupied under the Japanese colonial policy. Because of this, many discords arose between the residents of various places and the Korean residents.</p>
<p>The victory was achieved. The flames of war spread and spread. The ground was unstable and there was no way to plant seeds. Many of the forcibly occupied lands, the Korean farmers dared not plant, so at least one-third of the rice paddies in various places were abandoned. The life and economic foundations that the Korean residents in other cities had previously established under the Japanese power were also collapsing, so the lives of the Korean residents fell into extreme poverty.</p>
<p>Approximately 50,000 Korean residents voluntarily crossed the river to return to their country through Shenyang and Andong. 2,500 people were sent back to their country before the year by the US military in South Korea. Currently, there are still 1.3 million Korean residents in the nine provinces of the Northeast. Approximately 40,000 people are in the areas recovered by the National Army, and the remaining 80,000 to 90,000 people are in the areas occupied by the Communist Army.</p>
<p>Partial Repatriation</p>
<p>Our government has consistently maintained a policy of preferential treatment towards the 1 million Korean residents in the Northeast. Therefore, the handling policy is one of leniency, in order to achieve amity between the Chinese and Korean nations and to strive for peace in East Asia. Benign Korean residents are all allowed to continue residing and assist in production. Unkind residents will be repatriated to their country under a joint agreement between the two countries in the future. Regarding the Korean residents' property, also because the situation in the Northeast is special, the Northeast Executive Headquarters will refer to the local situation to formulate handling measures, which are currently under review by the Executive Yuan. It is said that this measure has been reviewed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant agencies and will be announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan soon.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1946, Korean residents in Shenyang established the "Shenyang Korean Residents General Association", with Shen Su as the chairman. On his way to Nanjing in the autumn of last year, he met with American personnel from the Beiping Military Mediation Department. At that time, he talked about the fact that there were tens of thousands of Korean refugees in the Northeast who had no livelihood and planned to return to their country, but had no way to go. The American representative especially telegraphed General MacArthur in Tokyo, and soon received a reply, allowing the repatriation of refugees to their country, but not to exceed 15,000 people, and only those living in South Korea who voluntarily wanted to return to their home country were allowed. Because the United States' overall Pacific repatriation work ended at the end of 1946, it was stipulated that the ships transporting Korean residents must return to Tokyo before December 31. Our side received the notification close to December, which was too short a period. The Korean residents, even more, were mostly unwilling to return to their country, so as a result, only 2,500 people were concentrated and great efforts were made to send them out of the Northeast.</p>
<p>For this repatriation of Korean residents, our country provided vehicles, ships, food, accommodation, sanitation, medical care, and all other expenses, with preferential treatment. Therefore, it was called repatriation, but it was actually escort. The repatriated people were quite aware of our side's kindness. In the future, if the Korean residents do not voluntarily request it, they will no longer be repatriated. This is the process and reason for the repatriation of Korean residents in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Rice and Korean Farmers</p>
<p>Before the restoration of the Northeast on August 15, Korean residents in the Northeast numbered no less than two million, and had cultivated 5.17 million mu of rice paddies. The total rice production could reach approximately 4.2 million shi, accounting for one-sixth of the total grain production in the Northeast. By 1946, more than half of the rice paddies were abandoned, and rice production was no longer sufficient to supply the needs of the Northeast. If this continues, there will be problems with the entire rice production in the Northeast. Because Northeast farmers are not good at growing rice in terms of habits, physical strength, and physiology, it is necessary to use Korean farmers. In the future, if we plan to maintain rice production in the Northeast, borrowing the strength of Korean farmers is a major plan. Today, among the industries operated by Korean residents in the recovered areas that have resumed operation, there are two rubber factories and three or four iron factories in Shenyang, six or seven "refined rice factories", and five or six iron factories and "refined rice factories" in Changchun. In addition, there are several iron factories and "refined rice factories" in Jilin and Yingkou, Andong, and other places.</p>
<p>The "Korean Residents Association" in Shenyang recently submitted a letter to the Shenyang Municipal Government on behalf of all Korean residents in Shenyang, saying: "The Korean residents living in Shenyang, because of the announcement of the central government's policy of leniency and the government's efforts to care for the Korean residents, have not only received spiritual comfort and liberation, but also the repatriation affairs of the Korean residents have been able to proceed smoothly. In the past year, the rice paddies cultivated by Korean farmers have been more than 3,000 hectares, more than 20 primary schools and 2 middle schools have been restored, dozens of industrial and commercial enterprises have been opened, and the "Korean Residents Industry Promotion Association" has been allowed to purchase rice produced by Korean farmers to supply military rations, so that Korean residents have the opportunity to express Sino-Korean friendship, and they are extremely grateful."</p>
<p>In addition, it cannot be denied that there are still a small number of Korean residents who are secretly doing sneaky things, as well as selling drugs, colluding with our ignorant compatriots to commit crimes. At the same time, because of the ban on dancing, many Korean dancers have changed their livelihood. Many prostitutes who engage in flesh and blood careers mostly spend the money of our compatriots. These compatriots act as their bosses. The rudeness and diseases are harming our armed brothers and working-class compatriots. Shijianfang Street in Shenyang is just this kind of situation.</p>
<p>New Sino-Korean Relations</p>
<p>Our government has been supporting the Korean independence movement for more than 30 years. The human resources, material resources, and financial resources spent cannot be counted. Even today, our government still provides the Korean delegation with several tens of thousands of yuan in expenses every month. At the Cairo Conference, Chairman Chiang first proposed the independence of Korea. After the victory, the government maintained its consistent policy and supported the Provisional Government of that country.</p>
<p>After Mr. Kim Gu, the chairman of the Provisional Government, returned to his country, our government extended deep sympathy and allowed him to keep a delegation stationed in China as diplomatic envoys to handle the affairs of overseas Chinese. Currently, the head of the delegation, Pu Chunfang, is stranded in Shenyang due to illness, and has established the Northeast General Office of the Korean Delegation in Xita, Shenyang. Director Bu Guang is a "China expert". In 1916, he graduated from China University in Beiping, and has since remained in China, fighting for the independence of his country. As for the overseas Chinese in the Northeast, various places have organized "Korean Residents Associations". The city of Shenyang has a "Korean Residents General Association," which is the overall organization representing the Korean residents in the Northeast.</p>
<p>When the National Army entered Jinzhou, the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters first established the "Korean Residents Affairs Office" to specifically handle matters such as the investigation of Korean residents and the registration of property. In the autumn of 1946, Chairman Chiang issued an order that matters related to Korean, Taiwanese, German, and Austrian overseas Chinese affairs should be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the former Korean Residents Affairs Office of the Headquarters was transformed into the "Korean Residents Affairs Office of the Northeast Special Envoy Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs" on September 26, 1946. The Korean Residents Affairs Office handles all general Korean residents affairs in the Northeast: such as the identification of kind and evil Korean residents, the protection of Korean residents, the statistics of household registration, the handling of property, the improvement of education, the relief of refugees, the increase in rice paddies, and the correction of ideological errors are all within the scope of its business.</p>
<p>Zhang Jianfei, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast, told reporters: "Today, the affairs of Korean residents in the Northeast are extremely important, and at the same time, we should have a new concept of Korean residents and do our best to help them!"</p>
<p>We hope that the Korean residents can recognize friends and enemies, can recall the past history of China and Korea, and can understand the future relationship between China and Korea in this world, make great efforts to universally and strongly establish the foundation of friendship between China and Korea!</p>
<h3>Northern Liaoning Education</h3>
<p>— Changchun, 16th (Air Dispatch) - Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>The work of taking over education in Northern Liaoning was divided into two stages. The first stage began on January 10th of last year and lasted until the communist army captured Siping Street on March 17th. During this period, only the Culture and Education Section of the puppet People's Livelihood Department was taken over, and it was ordered to temporarily maintain the status quo without any increase or decrease in personnel. The second stage of the takeover began on May 23rd, and only then was the actual takeover work fully launched.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Takeover Work</p>
<p>Mongolian banner education is different from that in other parts of the mainland. A special department should be established to take charge of its management. Currently, the Department of Education only has three sections: Secondary Education, National Education, and Social Education. There is no separate department specifically for Mongolian banner education.</p>
<p>During the second phase of the takeover, a total of 30 schools were taken over, including 4 puppet Manchukuo national and provincial normal schools, 21 puppet Siping provincial national high schools, and 5 vocational schools, all of which were converted into provincial schools. Furthermore, the schools taken over were reorganized and merged according to their nature, and adjusted according to local needs. A total of 34 schools were added, including 9 normal schools, 20 middle schools, and 5 vocational schools. As for the measures to revise the school system, normal schools were transformed into teachers' colleges, divided into two departments: regular teachers and vocational teachers; national high schools were transformed into middle schools, divided into senior and junior high school sections; and vocational schools were divided into senior and junior sections.</p>
<p>The training and selection of primary and secondary school teachers is an important task in post-recovery educational administration. The training work that Northern Liaoning Education should carry out includes: (A) Primary and secondary school teacher training seminars, lasting two weeks, training 120 teachers; (B) Middle school faculty and staff training courses, lasting three weeks, training 209 faculty and staff. In the summer, a selection committee was organized to preside over the matter. The original plan was to conduct the assessment in the form of training, but it was terminated due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Education in Hibernation</p>
<p>Regarding the current state of national education, according to statistics from last October, out of the 269 recovered streets and villages in the province, 754 schools have resumed classes, with 86,037 students and 2,652 teachers. As for social education, it is very difficult to promote due to social unrest and widespread poverty. Currently, it is in a state of hibernation.</p>
<p>Mongolian banner education is currently impossible to promote. It is recommended that the education department include it in the education plan. The schools planned to be rebuilt after recovery include Wangye Temple Middle School, Wangye Temple Girls' Middle School, Kezuo Middle Banner Middle School, Kezuo Front Banner Middle School, Kezuo Rear Banner Advanced Agricultural Vocational School, Wangye Temple Advanced Agricultural Vocational School, Wangye Temple Junior Vocational School, Wangye Temple Medical College, Wangye Temple Normal School, and Girls' Normal School. All of the above schools are provincial schools, and it is planned to complete the training of Mongolian banner teachers within five years, which can train 3,000 teachers and increase the number of students to 100,000.</p>
<p>Status of Industry, Mining, and Agriculture</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Northern Liaoning is still under military control, and the pace of construction is quite slow. In terms of industry and mining, after the "March 17th" upheaval, all data related to industrial and mining surveys were burned. There is no detailed survey of the current situation and extent of damage to industry, commerce, fisheries, and mines in the province. It is only known that there are currently four provincial-run factories: (A) Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory (started operations on June 20th last year); (B) Improved Horseshoe Factory (started operations on August 29th); (C) Model Iron Factory (started operations on August 20th); (D) People's Livelihood Supply Cooperative. All of the above were reorganized from factories taken over from the puppet regime.</p>
<p>In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, the construction includes: (A) Establishing provincial-run farms to implement joint management and collective production in order to gradually achieve modern agricultural management. Using the reclaimed land in the Dongliao River basin of Lishu County and the Shilizhen area of Changgang County that has been paid for, the unfinished irrigation projects will be continued as collective farms. The Dongliao River Farm was established last October. In addition, the unfinished water conservancy projects in Kouhe, Kaiyuan County, and Xinpan Mountain will be continued, and cooperative farms will be established using the nearby land that has not yet been paid for. (B) Establishing the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Project Agency. The Dongliao River has a long history of flooding. In order to prevent floods, the enemy puppet regime built large reservoirs and embankments in Shiling Village and Didazui Zi in the upper reaches of Lishu County, and implemented irrigation projects in Xiaochengzi Gujiazi in the lower reaches, but they were stopped due to surrender. After the recovery, it was decided to continue this project. In July last year, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan and the Northeast Branch of the Administrative Yuan, together with the governments of Liaoning and Hebei provinces, jointly decided to establish the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Committee to be responsible for construction supervision and guidance, and the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Project Bureau to be responsible for design and construction. The embankment project is currently being vigorously repaired, and the downstream irrigation is just beginning to be surveyed. (C) In order to improve livestock breeds and develop the province's livestock industry, a branch of the Provincial Livestock Improvement General Farm was established in Wohutun, Liaoyang, but due to the lack of funds and talent, the results are minimal.</p>
<p>New Transportation Lines in Northern Liaoning</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, highways are the main artery in Northern Liaoning. Based on military needs, highways are being repaired in two grades. The repaired highway bridges are as follows: 1,400 kilometers of main highway surface repaired, 1,390 bridge piers repaired; 1,300 kilometers of secondary highway surface repaired, 100 bridges repaired. In addition, there are plans to open two new lines: one is the Kaiyuan-Xi'an Highway, which is 124 kilometers long and has 16 bridge piers; the other is the Siping-Hailong Highway, which is 190 kilometers long and has 33 bridges. Both have been surveyed and completed, and the Xing Yuan has allocated 3 million yuan as a subsidy for the construction of the Kaiyuan-Xi'an Highway, and work has already begun.</p>
<p>Northern Liaoning has extremely abundant natural resources, and has superior conditions for industry, mining, agriculture, and animal husbandry. What is lacking is capital and organizational strength. If these two problems can be solved, the future of Northern Liaoning's construction will be very promising.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Flood Area Completes Three Plans, Preparing to Implement Reconstruction Work, Hefei Dispatch on February 28th</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Kang Feng</p>
<p>The disaster victims in the Yellow River flood area of northeastern Anhui have already survived the terrible winter. According to Ye Yuanlong, director of the Anhui Relief and Rescue Branch, the number of people who suffered thoroughly from the floods in 1946 was 900,000, which is not as high as the rumors. Among these 900,000 disaster victims, the child victims have been accommodated in 600 child victim stations with 90,000 people. The Huai River embankment repair project has absorbed 30,000 to 100,000 able-bodied disaster victims, and the remaining tens of thousands of people are making a living by fishing in the waterfront area. Therefore, the famine of those engaged in production has been alleviated due to the work-relief flour and fish catches. The actual number of deaths does not exceed 10,000. Currently, the manpower and material resources that Anhui Province can mobilize are all preparing to implement reconstruction work in the Yellow River flood area. Professor Jiang Diqiu of the branch's agricultural technology department has completed three plans:</p>
<p>(1) Replanting: He has requested tractors from the Shanghai Joint Relief Committee and established mobile tractor stations in Wuhe, Fengyang, Shouxian, and Fuyang, with five machines at each station. Each machine cultivates 50 mu of land per day, so that the Yellow River flood area can be replanted.</p>
<p>(2) Seeds: The supply of seeds has been arranged. Because the wheat planting season has passed, the Executive Yuan has approved the allocation of 50,000 shi of sorghum, soybeans, and millet seeds for supply. In addition, the Administrative Yuan has exchanged 300 tons of flour for sorghum and soybean seeds, and the Administrative Yuan has also allocated 250 tons of cotton seeds and 15 tons of sorghum for supply. It is estimated that 2 million mu of the 4 million mu of disaster-stricken farmland in the Yellow River flood area will be replanted with the above seeds. The rest was replanted by farmers themselves after the floodwaters receded last winter.</p>
<p>(3) Agricultural Loans: The central government has decided to allocate 2.4 billion yuan, and the Wuhu Farmers Bank has sent people to northeastern Anhui to provide loans so that disaster-stricken farmers can purchase reconstruction equipment. Jiang Diqiu believes that the current replanting period must be sown before the end of March, and the tractors, seeds, and funds promised by the central government and the Joint Relief Committee must be allocated and delivered in a timely manner so that they can be deployed and used. If there is a delay, the seasonality of agriculture will frustrate the reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area. The Anhui Agricultural Assistance Committee, which will be held in Bengbu on March 5, will decide on the agricultural technical personnel and area allocation to be completed at the lower level.</p>
<p>Professor Jiang is Dedicated to Locust Control, the Green Terror Can Be Eliminated</p>
<p>From June to October 1946, the green terror of locusts in 15 counties in northeastern Anhui could have caused a major blow to the autumn harvest. Professor Jiang Diqiu fully launched locust control efforts. He set up 24 central locust catching stations in other areas. Three catties of one- to two-year-old juvenile locusts were exchanged for one catty of flour. One catty of five-year-old flying adult locusts was exchanged for one catty of flour. One catty of locust eggs was exchanged for four catties of flour. In five months, three large-scale locust catches were carried out. 400,000 soldiers, police, men, women, old and young were mobilized to catch locusts in the sorghum, wheat, bean and green leaves of northeastern Anhui, killing a total of 3.4 million catties of locusts, saving more than 10,000 tons of wheat and grain production, which is the first achievement in the history of northeastern Anhui. It is predicted that the locust plague this year can be reduced.</p>

<h3>The Communist Army in Chahar</h3>
<p>— Urgent News from Zhangjiakou on February 15th, Our Reporter in Chahar Jie Zhong</p>
<p>It should be the season of spring, but the frontier is still snowing. The spring breeze cannot bring vitality and warmth. The people of Chahar Province are still in the bitter sea of sorrow and fear.</p>
<p>It has been more than four months since Chahar Province was recovered. The national army has made its greatest efforts to control all cities and transportation lines. The Ping-Sui Railway has been opened to traffic, and the train is crawling slowly on the repaired detour. From Beiping to Baotou, it carries passengers and goods all day long. This wounded artery has brought nutrition and hope to the people of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. There have only been two minor damages to the Ping-Zhang Line. Since the opening of the Zhang-Tong Line, there have been no accidents. The highways from Zhangyuan to various counties are all safely passable, and the urban security is now generally stable.</p>
<p>The communist army suffered irreparable failures due to strategic errors, and also suffered a lot in the battles of Jiming and Huailai. Its main force has withdrawn from Chahar Province, and large-scale activities have been suppressed. The mountains and ridges in eastern Chahar have always been the base of the communist army, and there are still three brigades of troops, with 7,000 to 8,000 people, carrying out "roving bandit" disturbances. Yun Ze leads a small number of troops, operating in the Beizi Temple area of ​​northern Chahar Mongolian banner. The political role exceeds the military value. Dananshan, Weiting, southern Chahar, is the old nest of the communist army in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area. Both sides have deployed heavy troops to guard it, and it seems that neither side has any active intentions.</p>
<p>All this shows that large-scale battles will not break out in Chahar Province in a short period of time. Developing pacification work is the task of the national army and the hope of the people.</p>
<p>At present, the cadres of the Chinese Communist Party are still intensifying the creation of disasters and evils. The political organization of the Chinese Communist Party has not retreated together with the military. Under the slogan of "counties do not leave counties, districts do not leave districts, and townships do not leave townships," a part of the cadres have been sent back to their own districts and townships to do internal money work. The rest are still active on the edge of the mountains and in the gaps where the national army's control is not enough. They rely on their familiarity with the geography, the complexity of the terrain, the strict organization, and the clear intelligence to their advantage. When the national army comes to eliminate them, they become invisible by turning into small pieces.</p>
<p>Night is the best cover for the communist army's activities. In the villages near their base, scattered communist army cadres will come at night. They want food and drink, revenge killings, and even grain and cloth. They want shoes and socks, meat and cigarettes. Young men, for fear of being recruited into the communist army, dare not stay at home at night. They spend the night in the ditches and hillsides in the cold of more than 20 degrees below zero, and have to wait until dawn.</p>
<p>In the areas where the communist army is rampant, the lives of the people are not guaranteed. The communist army hates the most are the Baojia chiefs who were elected by the people to help the government, and the compatriots who have served the national army. Twenty-five Baojia chiefs were killed by the communist army in Zhuolu County, and three were killed in Huailai County, making the people regard being a Baojia chief as a fearful path. The government also has to limit the people to take turns to serve every day. A family in Chongli County once had several soldiers of the national army passing by. They warmly entertained them and brought out "oil cakes" to comfort them. In less than two days, these two compatriots were stabbed to death by the communist army in the middle of the night! An old man in his sixties had both hands cut off by the communist army for cooking a meal for the national army. The communist army really takes killing as a "joke." After the Spring Festival, in a village in Huailai County, they performed "Yangko," and mixed in the old drama "The Case of Zha Mei," and actually cut three good people to death as Chen Shimei! Whenever the communist army arrives in a place, they always let the people leave quickly, which is called "running the situation." So they buried landmines everywhere, trying to trap the national army. The number of people who died under landmines is impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>In the places that have been fought over by the communist army, the houses are either without roofs or lack windows and doors. In the severe cold of more than 20 degrees below zero, the people lack clothing and fuel. Some use their beloved furniture as fuel, and some simply dismantle and burn houses. Many families have not added new clothes for ten years, and the tattered clothes can't even cover the places that are considered shameful in morality. Some families have only one decent set of clothes. Whoever goes out wears it first, and the rest have to cower in the mud pit.</p>
<p>After Chongli County was slaughtered and robbed by the communist army, the orphans and widows left behind have only received 10,000 yuan in relief money and dozens of catties of white flour per person in the past few months. They are not only short of food and clothing, but also panic about firewood and water!</p>
<p>Xinming County was formerly Dehua. After the Japanese surrender, a certain mechanized army lived there for more than 40 days, killing sheep and chickens every day. When they left, they drove away all the sheep and pulled away more than 6,000 cattle and three more horses. Then came the communist army's struggle for liquidation. Under the policy of "leveling the high and padding the low," in the end, as long as the farmers wearing leather jackets and felt hats became the targets of the struggle.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party encourages its cadres in this way: "The more chaotic the society, the better, the more afraid the people, the better." Local ruffians are the capable cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and the life-threatening阎王 of the people. The night seems to enter hell, and the people hand over their lives to these "district dogs" and "district legs" (communist army cadres), and they may be killed at any time! Relatives were killed! Tears flow into the stomach, afraid that publicizing will bring more disasters!</p>
<p>The rural economy has moved towards the edge of production stagnation and bankruptcy. Spring is coming, and the spring ploughing season is approaching. Although the farmers have spring ploughing acquaintances, they have no spring ploughing conditions. The Chinese Communist Party's land policy and liquidation struggle have created many disputes. Although, in the current turbulent and insecure situation, no one dares to propose a solution too early. The landlords dare not ask about the liquidated land, fearing that the communist army will come back to struggle. The tenant farmers are unable to cultivate and are deliberately waiting and watching. The rich peasants have become poor, and the self-cultivating peasants are even poorer! When the communist army retreated, the people's vehicles, cattle and horses were all pulled away to transport materials, and less than half of them escaped. The grain was eaten, and the seeds became a problem. The agricultural tools were destroyed, or they have been used as fuel. Horse grass and feed are even more exhausted. After two lootings in northern Chahar, the cattle have disappeared. How can they cultivate with bare hands? Even if the grain harvested after all the hardships, who knows who will get it? In the end, they will still be unable to avoid hunger and starvation! The painful memories make people have to make bad plans. The farming season is missed. This problem is too serious, but the farmers have no way to live in front of them. What about the distant future? The hope of spring ploughing, like the previous years, can only be placed on government loans and relief.</p>
<p>Although the material life is extremely difficult, the people can still endure the minimum. The mental fear and panic is the threat to the lives of the people. In the places where the communist army haunts, the people dare not say what they want to say, dare not do what they want to do, "dare to hate but dare not speak" to the communist army, and want to be close to the national army but dare not express it clearly. They have truly lost the "four major freedoms." It seems that there is a terrible shadow following them, monitoring them, and preparing to accept the most unfortunate encounter at any time!</p>
<p>Today, what the people urgently need is the guarantee of life safety. They certainly hope that more national troops will be stationed in their towns and villages to protect them forever. But they are deeply afraid that once the national army leaves, the communist army will come back and re-do the meat on the chopping board. Therefore, they call on the government to issue weapons and arm themselves for self-defense. They need weapons more urgently than other relief materials. They would rather eat less and wear less, and also want to have weapons in their hands to defend their lives. The people are no longer willing to be brutally oppressed, and they are rising up to take forceful action.</p>
<p>The people living in the cities are still relatively stable, but the heavy pressure of life is also making people breathless. The destruction of the communist army has caused 90% of the factories to be closed. The enemy's nine years of operation was destroyed by the communist army overnight. Time, money, equipment, and stability are also important conditions for repatriation. The Longyan Iron Mine, which has 30,000 workers, now only has dozens of people guarding the broken walls and ruins and the broken machines! A large number of workers are unemployed, and relief is just a drop in the bucket. A series of social problems are happening. How can the income of public officials and teachers keep up with the soaring prices? The weakening of purchasing power, the stagnation of sales in rural areas, and the decline of commerce are all expected! If the border defense is a heavy town and a large army is gathered, the burden of firewood, housing, horse grass, and horse feed will be increased on the people invisibly. If they encounter undisciplined troops, they don't know how much trouble they will suffer.</p>
<p>This picture of misery is the epitome of the lives of the people of Chahar Province. The harsh reality is whipping the people. How can the people live in this evil flow of disaster and fear?</p>
<p>(Above) The beautiful Songhua River Village, many villa-style mansions, have been reduced to ashes in the communist army's artillery fire this time.

<h3>Inside Story of the American Historical Association: Impressions from the Sixty-First Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>— Li Dongfang</p>
<p>Not long ago in Washington, D.C., I met Mr. Solon J. Buck, the director of the American Language Collection. Unexpectedly, a few days later I encountered him again in New York as the treasurer of the American Historical Association, attending the sixty-first annual meeting in New York. The meeting lasted four days, from December 27th to 30th. The venue was the Pennsylvania Hotel.</p>
<p>The magnificent and luxurious hotel was filled with scholars from all directions. Many of these prolific scholars were over sixty years old, with youthful faces and white hair. They occupied the grand ballroom (fortunately not during dance hours) and several small lounges where private conversations could take place. The atmosphere was boisterous, resembling a joyous occasion or diplomatic reception rather than academic research. The younger members seemed more serious, carefully observing and secretly recording the casual conversations of their seniors. Several ladies, appearing to be both reporters and members, scurried around with notebooks, diligently recording everything they heard. Along the corridor, representatives from major bookstores sat in a long row, seemingly competing to display their published history books, undoubtedly reaping substantial profits. Among them, "Service of Bibliography," a business that seemed to be both a bookstore and not, stood out, showcasing antique books. Besides selling rare and out-of-print books, they also offered services such as transcribing books and finding research materials.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before the conference, the board of directors held a meeting. In addition to the directors, four officers attended: the president, vice president, treasurer, and executive secretary cum editor of the association's journal. The structure of the board of directors is excellent, and I believe the Chinese Historical Association could emulate it. All past presidents serve as directors, with an additional eight elected directors serving four-year terms, two of whom are replaced each year.</p>
<p>The current president is Mr. Sidney B. Fay of Harvard University. The vice president is Mr. Thomas J. Wertenbaker of Princeton University, and the executive secretary is Mr. Guy Stanton Ford, who is stationed at the association. Among the directors is Mr. J. Salwyn Schapiro, a scholar known to many Chinese scholars, who now teaches at the City University of New York.</p>
<p>The president naturally gave an opening speech, but he was very polite, placing his formal lecture on the evening of the second day, titled "The Idea of Progress." To emphasize the progressive aspirations of historians, the first day's agenda began with "Freedom and Restraint." The chairman was Mr. W. L. Westernman of Columbia University. The three speakers were Issac Mendelcohn, who spoke on "Slavery and Serfdom in the Ancient Near East"; Carl Stephenson, who spoke on "The Main Characteristics of Medieval Serfdom"; and W. G. Zeefeld, who spoke on "Labor and Egalitarianism in the Sixteenth Century." All were excellent, representing the fruits of a year's labor. After each speaker, a designated "discussant" politely raised a few easily answerable questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, listeners couldn't be in multiple places at once. At the same time, in other rooms, there were also insightful discussions to be heard. Some were discussing "Russia's Search for a Seaport," others were discussing "French Constitutionalism," and still others were discussing "New Approaches to Local History." It was truly a shame.</p>
<p>During lunchtime, Mr. Hans Staehle was designated to speak on "New Discoveries Regarding the Economic and Social History of Prussia in the Early Nineteenth Century." Although the new discoveries were not numerous, they generated considerable interest. I thought that if all lectures could be widely disseminated to various universities, it would certainly increase the number of students choosing to study history.</p>
<p>In another dining room, I saw Mr. Buck chairing a session. A historian currently working for the Department of State spoke extensively on "International Documents and Their Preservation," and the acting director of the United Nations Archives reported on how he preserves the United Nations archives.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the meetings continued, continuing, continuing to study the issue of "Freedom and Restraint." Mr. Eric Williams spoke on "Slavery and Indentured Labor Under Nineteenth-Century Imperialism"; Mr. Herbert Harris spoke on "Restrictions on Freedom in Today's World." Mr. Harris was unreserved in his criticism of restrictions of all kinds.</p>
<p>In the other three rooms, people were studying "France After Liberation," "England in the Late Middle Ages," and "Latin America." Who could be in multiple places at once?</p>
<p>At dinner in the evening, there were two more speakers. One spoke on "The Idea of the Magna Carta," which was unremarkable. The other spoke on "The Problem of Eating Meat Among Western Explorers," which was quite unique, especially since he was speaking when everyone had meat to eat.</p>
<p>Among the many lectures on the second day, the one that caught my attention most was Mr. John K. Fairbank's discussion on the research program for Far Eastern history. He reported on how he was guiding graduate students at Harvard University to conduct in-depth research on specialized topics related to Far Eastern history. Today, most universities in the United States have Far Eastern departments, but Harvard is one of the exceptions. Pomona College, near Los Angeles in southwestern United States, has the richest collection of books related to the Far East. Under the direction of the late Mr. Laufer, the University of Chicago also has a good foundation. The University of Pittsburgh and the University of Vermont, which recently established Far Eastern departments, are full of promise. Unfortunately, although San Francisco University and the University of Southern California also had Far Eastern departments, one was interrupted, and the other was greatly diminished due to the departure of the person in charge. As for the Chinese department at Columbia University, led by Mr. Goodrich, it is comparable to some of the best Chinese literature departments in China.</p>
<p>The third day was Sunday, so the morning session was adjourned. In the afternoon, there were still two speakers discussing the anti-clerical movement in France and Italy. After attending church in the morning, it was naturally not dry to listen to this topic in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, there were twenty-four speakers. Their meeting is unlike our usual meetings. Only with such extensive lectures can it be worthy of being an annual meeting of an academic organization. Otherwise, if it's just a banquet, an election, and some idle chatter, what academic content is there? We Chinese are too cautious. Those with good scholarship always "hide their abilities," unwilling to easily show them, and they are too concerned about face, unable to withstand others' "discussions." In fact, knowledge is a common asset of humanity. Your conclusions may not even be yours; aren't they derived from reconciling others' conclusions or evidence? When others refute or revise your conclusions, your contribution is already "immortal." Liu Bang may have gained the world, but Xiang Yu is also worthy of being a failed hero.</p>
<p>The highlight was the issue of the connection between secondary school history curricula and university history curricula. This issue is indeed very important. In addition to the connection between universities and secondary schools in China, there is also the connection between junior high schools and senior high schools. I hope that the Chinese Historical Association, under the leadership of Hu Shih, Gu Jiegang, Fu Sinian, Miao Fenglin, and Shen Gangbo, can hold more annual meetings. People's history is only two or three hundred years old, yet they have already held sixty-one annual meetings of the American Historical Association.</p>
<h3>Special Products with Artistic Value: A Look at the Past and Present of Fuzhou Lacquerware</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu, Fuzhou Telegraph Dispatch, 20th</p>
<p>Fuzhou's special product, lacquerware, has a history of over two hundred years and was sold throughout China, Southeast Asia, and Europe and America before the war. Those who have been to Fuzhou all praise the artistic value of Fuzhou lacquerware. The exquisite paintings and skillful craftsmanship are truly breathtaking! Shanghai is a major market for Fuzhou lacquerware. Almost every household, if decorated with a set of Fuzhou lacquerware, will appear radiant.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Bringing Glory to the Country</p>
<p>As early as the mid-Qing Dynasty, Shen Shaoan, a native of Fuzhou, discovered the method of making bodiless lacquerware during his apprenticeship. Later, he began to manufacture lightweight utensils such as bowls and boxes, which were appreciated by the gentry and common people of the time. Legend has it that Mr. Liu from Xiqiao ordered several washing bowls from Shen's workshop to be shipped back to his country. The ship capsized halfway, but the lacquerware, being lightweight, remained floating on the surface of the sea. A sailor from another ship picked them up, brought them back to America, and shared them with others, marking the beginning of Fuzhou lacquerware's sales overseas. During the Qing Dynasty, Shen Min brought his exquisite lacquerware to an industrial exhibition in Southeast Asia and received an honorary medal. The Qing government also awarded Shen a commercial title and a fourth-rank official hat, expressing its encouragement for the arts. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a commercial certificate in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and honorary certificates were also received for participation in the Panama Fair in the tenth year of the Republic of China and the Shanghai National Industrial Exhibition in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Shen's lacquerware was praised as an unparalleled work of art at the International Exposition in Chicago, USA, and won a first-class Flying Eagle Medal. Fuzhou lacquerware can truly be called the leader of the world's lacquerware industry, bringing glory to the country.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Techniques: Lifelike and Exquisite</p>
<p>Although Fujian does not produce lacquer, Fuzhou lacquerware is particularly famous. China's lacquer trees are mostly found in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. The lacquer used to make Fuzhou lacquerware is transported from Sichuan. Besides lacquer, other materials are needed, such as old Phoebe wood (because it is sturdy), silk cloth, and pigments like gold and silver powder and coral red. There are three types of manufacturing methods:</p>
<p>(1) Bodiless—First, a clay model is made, covered with thin silk cloth, and coated with lacquer liquid mixed with flour. A hole is left at the bottom. After it dries, it is polished with fine bricks to make it shiny. This process of applying lacquer and polishing is repeated more than twenty times over a period of eight months. When the lacquer mold is firm, it is soaked in water, which enters through the bottom hole, completely dissolving the clay model. The remaining clay is removed with a needle, leaving the lacquer body. It is then scraped clean, polished, and coated with gold powder and vibrant colors. It is lightweight and durable, and will not fade even after hundreds of years. This is considered finely made.</p>
<p>(2) Semi-Bodiless—A model is carved from old Phoebe wood, covered with thin silk cloth, and coated with lacquer fifteen times, taking half a year to complete. It is heavier in weight.</p>
<p>(3) Wood-Based—A model is carved from old Phoebe wood and coated with fading lacquer, which is specially formulated in Yongjia. It is coated with lacquer ten times, taking four months to complete. It is the heaviest in weight. This type of lacquerware does not change color for a long time. There are also miscellaneous lacquer shops that use pig's blood instead of lacquer to make lacquerware, which will change color within six months. This is not genuine Fuzhou lacquerware.</p>
<p>Most lacquerware is decorative, especially vases, cigarette boxes, and cake boxes. Sculptures of figures (including deities) and paintings of landscapes, flowers, and birds are also common, rendered with lifelike detail. The manufacturing techniques are ingenious. First, one needs sharp eyesight, a calm mind for composition, and delicate handling. The warm climate of southern China is also a favorable condition for making lacquerware. There are many secrets involved, which manufacturers are reluctant to share in detail.</p>
<p>Twenty Lacquerware Shops: A Lineage of Transmission</p>
<p>Shen Fu'an is the founder of the Fuzhou lacquerware industry, and generally, it is believed that Shen's lacquerware techniques are the most refined. In addition to the old brand of Shen Fu'an, there are currently about twenty lacquerware shops of various sizes in Fuzhou, with approximately three hundred technicians and workers. There are about fifty top-level technicians, who are said to be all descendants of the Shen lineage. The organization of lacquerware workshops is divided into six departments in terms of technology:</p>
<p>(1) Wood Department—Responsible for carving models. (2) Clay Department—Responsible for molding models. (3) Lacquer Department—Responsible for mixing and applying lacquer. (4) Painting Department—Responsible for painting. (5) Carving Department—Responsible for carving the lacquer surface. (6) Color Matching Department—Responsible for mixing various pigments such as gold, silver, and coral red.</p>
<p>Technicians must train for more than five years before they can start manufacturing. Currently, technicians work eight hours a day, and their wages range from 10,000 to 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, their business was thriving and at its peak. After the war, due to the weak purchasing power of the general public, the inconvenience of transportation, and the difficulty of sourcing raw materials, it has gradually declined. It is said that the total sales of lacquerware in the Beijing and Shanghai areas last year were less than 100 million yuan. Business in Fuzhou is even more dismal, and the lives of ordinary people are extremely difficult. Who has the leisure to appreciate works of art? However, the manufacture of lacquerware still has its artistic and economic value. With a history of over two hundred years and a reputation at home and abroad, how can we bear to see the Fuzhou lacquerware industry gradually decline? If the government could provide production loans or support it financially through a public-private partnership to maintain its former prosperity and compete for the international markets of Southeast Asia and Europe and America, it might be a way to earn foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Truth Knows, God Knows, But Must Wait</h3>
<p>— By Leo Tolstoy, Translated by Tian Zhongji</p>
<p>In the town of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitrievich Aksionov. He had two shops and a house.</p>
<p>Aksionov was a handsome young man with curly fair hair, cheerful and fond of music. In his youth, he had been given to drink and was sometimes riotous when drunk, but after his marriage, he gave up the habit altogether, except for an occasional glass.</p>
<p>One summer, Aksionov was going to the Nizhny Fair, and as he bade farewell to his family, his wife said to him, "Ivan Dmitrievich, do not start today; I have had a bad dream about you."</p>
<p>Aksionov laughed and said, "You are afraid that when I get to the fair, I shall go on the spree."</p>
<p>His wife replied, "I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamt that you returned from the town, and when you took off your cap, I saw that your hair was quite grey."</p>
<p>Aksionov laughed. "That is a lucky sign," said he. "See if I do not sell all my goods and bring you some presents from the fair."</p>
<p>So he took leave of his family and started.</p>
<p>When he had travelled halfway, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they put up at the same inn for the night. They had some tea together, and then went to bed in adjoining rooms.</p>
<p>Aksionov was not in the habit of getting up late, and, wishing to travel while it was still cool, he aroused his servant early and told him to harness the horses.</p>
<p>Then he went to the landlord (who lived in the back yard) to pay his bill, and continued his journey.</p>
<p>When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped to feed the horses. Aksionov rested for a while in the passage of the inn, then he went to the samovar and ordered some tea, and while he was drinking it, he took out his guitar and began to play.</p>
<p>Suddenly a troika drove up with tinkling bells, and an official alighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksionov and began to question him, asking who he was and whence he came. Aksionov answered him fully, and said, "Won't you have some tea?" But the official went on cross-questioning him and asking him, "Where did you spend last night? Were you alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this morning? Why did you leave the inn so early?"</p>
<p>Aksionov wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he described all that had happened, and then added, "Why do you cross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my own, and there is no need to question me."</p>
<p>Then the official called the soldiers and said, "I am the police officer of this district, and I have to question you because the merchant with whom you stayed last night has been murdered. We must search your things."</p>
<p>They entered the house and the soldiers and the police officer unpacked Aksionov's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife from a bag, exclaiming, "Whose knife is this?"</p>
<p>Aksionov looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag, he was frightened.</p>
<p>"How is it there is blood on this knife?"</p>
<p>Aksionov tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only stammered: "I—don't know—it must be—not mine."</p>
<p>Then the police officer said: "This morning the merchant was found in bed with his throat cut. You are the only one who could have done it. The house was locked from inside, and no one else was there. Here is this blood-stained knife in your bag, and your face and manner betray you! Tell me, how did you kill him, and how much money did you steal?"</p>
<p>Aksionov swore he had not done it and that he had not seen the merchant after they had had tea together; that he had no money except his own eight thousand rubles, and that the knife was not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear as though he were guilty.</p>
<p>The police officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksionov and to put him in the cart. As they tied him, Aksionov crossed himself and wept. His money and goods were taken from him, and he was sent to the nearest town and imprisoned there. Enquiry was made about Aksionov's character in Vladimir. The merchants and other inhabitants of that town said that in former days he had been given to drink and was fond of rioting but that since his marriage he had left off these habits and was a good man. Then the trial came on, he was charged with murdering a merchant from Ryazan and robbing him of twenty thousand rubles.</p>
<p>His wife was crushed, not knowing whether to believe it or not. All her children were quite small; one was still at her breast. She took them all with her, and went to the town where her husband was in jail. At first, she was not allowed to see him, but after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials and was led to him. When she saw her husband in prison clothes, chained and shaved, among criminals and hardened convicts, she fell down, and did not come to her senses for a long time. Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him. She told him of things at home, and asked about what had happened to him. He told her everything. She asked, "What can we do now?"</p>
<p>"We must petition the Czar not to let an innocent man perish."</p>
<p>His wife told him that she had petitioned the Czar, but her petition had not been granted.</p>
<p>Aksionov did not reply, but only looked down cast.</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "It was not for nothing I had that bad dream. You remember? You should not have started that day." And seizing hold of his hand, she said, "Tell me the truth: Was it you who did it?"</p>
<p>Aksionov exclaimed, "You, too, suspect me!" and, hiding his face in his hands, began to weep. Then a jailer came and said that the wife and children must go away; and Aksionov said good-bye to his family for the last time.</p>
<p>When they were gone, Aksionov recalled what his wife had said, and when he remembered that she also suspected him, he said to himself, "It seems that only God can know the truth; it is to Him alone I must appeal, and from Him alone expect mercy."</p>
<p>And Aksionov wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only prayed to God.</p>
<p>Aksionov was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. He was flogged with the knout, and when the wounds were healed, he was sent to Siberia with other convicts.</p>
<p>Aksionov lived as a convict in Siberia for twenty-six years. His hair turned quite white, and his beard grew long, thin, and grey. All his mirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little, and never laughed, but he often prayed.</p>
<p>In prison Aksionov learned to make boots, and earned a little money, with which he bought the "Acts of the Apostles." He read it when there was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays in the prison church he read the lessons and sang in the choir, for his voice was still good. The prison officials liked Aksionov for his meekness, and his fellow prisoners respected him; they called him "Grandfather," and "The Saint." When they wanted to petition the prison officials about anything, they always made Aksionov their spokesman, and when quarrels occurred among them, they appealed to him to judge and settle the matter.</p>
<p>No news reached Aksionov from his home; he did not even know if his wife and children were still alive.</p>
<p>One day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening the old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked them what towns they came from, and what they were sentenced for. Among the rest Aksionov sat down near the new comers, and listened dejectedly.</p>
<p>One of the new convicts, a tall, strong old man of about sixty, with a closely cropped grey beard, was relating why he had been arrested.</p>
<p>"Well, friends," he said, "I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge, and was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had only taken it to get home quicker, and had meant to return it soon. And so it was; I said, 'It's all right, the owner will find it soon enough.' But they said, 'No, you stole it.' But I'll tell you what—I've been where I was before, and I didn't intend to stick to this here. I've been in Siberia before, but I didn't stay long."</p>
<h3>Mother and Child (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Wu Junfa</p>
<h3>My Grievances</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>In the past, I was the most skilled at complaining. The reason for this, of course, had seemingly unavoidable causes: First, I was "born at the wrong time," and my family was exceptionally poor; second, in school, my grades were consistently better than others, leading to arrogance; third, my emotions were easily stirred; and fourth, I just happened to love literature. These were all internal reasons, stemming from my own being. Originally, these reasons wouldn't necessarily become the driving force behind my complaints, if there were no external reasons to rub against them. However, external reasons relentlessly exerted their power, causing me to falter, and I could only embark on a life filled with complaints.</p>
<p>What were these external reasons? First, snobbery, which looks down on poor children; second, what society needs is fundamentally different from what schools need—the inferior students in school are often the tycoons of society, while the superior students, especially those with integrity who refuse to yield or compromise, only encounter setbacks everywhere; third, society needs those who are confident and composed, never revealing their true colors—the more fake, the better; fourth, literature has no way out, or rather, it has no way out in contemporary China. These external factors, like a great furnace, burned me, burning me to the point where I almost had no place to exist, so I could only complain, attaching myself to the ranks of men of letters, and like other men of letters throughout history, using it as a way to console myself.</p>
<p>So I sighed. Upon seeing a close old friend, I was like a lost child seeing its mother, pouring out a string of grievances. Some old friends still had old feelings and always comforted me; those with the ability even helped to improve my situation somewhat. However, such old friends were very few, so few that they were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. What about most old friends? The more agreeable ones would remain silent, frowning and lowering their heads, fulfilling their obligation to listen, waiting until I had finished complaining before offering a few perfunctory words; those who lacked patience and had long forgotten the friendship would either blame me for my lack of social skills or "speak of other things," not wanting to listen. If I continued to nag, they would say, "I have some things to do; let's talk another day," thus ending my complaints. Fortunately, I only complained in front of old friends; I don't know what kind of unbearable situation I would be put in if I complained in front of new friends!</p>
<p>Naturally, I also cursed. I cursed corrupt officials; I hated profiteering merchants; I cursed ingrates; I cursed shameless people; I cursed dissolute people; I cursed pedantic people; I cursed any bad people; I cursed old habits, evil forces; I cursed imperialism and feudalism; I cursed any harmful things. I cursed indiscriminately, cursing regardless of the time or place, and even more so, cursing without choosing people—only cursing in front of people who sympathized with me. Cursing felt good, which meant complaining felt good.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my complaining didn't reach the point of madness, so I wouldn't resort to hitting people, nor would I cry or sing for no reason. This may be due to my normal lifestyle, with absolutely no vices, so I can still maintain the balance of my mind and brain. However, I struggled and resisted, and the resentful spirit of a skin-deep complaint was never exhausted—extremely bitter, extremely bitter!</p>
<p>I cannot but thank the War of Resistance Against Japan, for it rescued me from the snare of complaining, and I have never complained since. As soon as the war broke out, I felt that all personal matters should be put aside; otherwise, without one's own country, there would be no society, no family, so what personal matters could one have! And danger was like a sword hanging over one's head, with the possibility of a violent death every day, so what was there to complain about! During the eight years of the war, this feeling of mine became clearer and clearer, turning into a force for regeneration, no longer trapped by complaints.</p>
<p>Because of the war, I saw all kinds of changes and confirmed that the teachings I received in school and church when I was young were true: Only by forgetting oneself for the sake of others can one find true happiness!</p>
<p>Now, the environment has not improved, and what I am enduring is not necessarily easier to endure than before the war. But I no longer complain, simply because I have learned to forget myself and serve others.</p>
<p>Pitiful men of letters, especially those who are skilled at complaining, must be numerous, right? What do you think of my words? I don't want to boast, and there is nothing to boast about anyway; I just want to make some contribution to you: please, don't complain.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for Newcomers—A Report on Literary and Artistic Work</h3>
<p>— Fan Quan</p>
<p>The "Literary and Artistic Spring and Autumn," Volume 4, Issue 3 (to be published on the 15th of next month), launched a "Symposium on the Issue of Recommending Newcomers." As a result, as many as seventeen writers participated. What we are particularly grateful for are those writers from other cities, such as Duanmu Yiliang from Hankou, Lin Huanping from Hong Kong, SY from Chengdu, Tian Tao from Wanxian, Sichuan, Xu Chi from Wuxing Nanxun, and Zhong Jingwen from Guangzhou. They all wrote their manuscripts from distant cities and sent them to us by express mail. This kind of work, which does not shrink from complexity and fatigue in order to cultivate new literary and artistic talents, truly made us feel unparalleled joy when we received the manuscripts one after another.</p>
<p>Regarding this symposium on the issue of recommending newcomers, we sent letters to various writers in advance. The original text of the letter was as follows: Mr. ×××,</p>
<p>If the field of literature and art is similar to the field of fruit trees, then the harvest of flowers and fruits requires the continuous cultivation of diligent gardeners. Since the May Fourth Movement, the life of Chinese new literature and art has had several decades of history. In this period, which is neither lengthy nor too short, the rise and fall of batches of writers has given us a valuable lesson: In order to cultivate the field of literature and art, in order to create beautiful flowers and fruits, it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of old gardeners; we obviously need the cooperation of new gardeners, need to irrigate new blood, and need to enrich new strength. Since its publication, this journal has never neglected the work of discovering newcomers, but because of space limitations, it has not been able to fully accommodate them. Now, it has been decided to publish the works of newcomers in their entirety in Volume 4, Issue 3, in an attempt to introduce them on a large scale. Before the editing and printing of this "Newcomer Recommendation Issue," we would like to solicit your opinions on eight issues regarding the discovery of newcomers, in order to compile and publish them for readers and authors to study. We have always admired your enthusiasm for the cultivation of Chinese new literature and art, and especially your dedication to the recommendation and introduction of new authors. Therefore, we dare to write to you and request that you provide a reply by February 20th and submit it to our office at No. 380 Fuzhou Road in this city. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Literary and Artistic Spring and Autumn Monthly Journal. Enclosed with the above letter were the following eight questions:</p>
<p>(1) What attitude should the editors of journals and literary supplements adopt when dealing with the works of newcomers (whether excellent works or immature works)?</p>
<p>(2) Based on your personal editing experience in the past, what difficulties have you felt in reading and introducing manuscripts from outside, and what methods can be used to overcome these difficulties?</p>
<p>(3) Why is the work of discovering and cultivating newcomers so necessary in the process of literary and artistic growth? According to what literary and artistic theory can this principle be explained?</p>
<p>(4) Generally speaking, an ideal introduction would be to publish the works of newcomers along with the after-reading opinions of veteran writers. However, would such a method limit the understanding of the works themselves to some extent? Is it truly beneficial to the authors? Are there other better and more effective methods of recommendation?</p>
<p>(5) Due to the scarcity of purely literary journals and supplements at present, it is very difficult to accommodate a large number of new works. What methods can be used to overcome this difficulty?</p>
<p>(6) If the editors of several major journals and supplements were to jointly organize a communication mechanism dedicated to introducing the works of newcomers, and with the support of veteran writers, send works of above-average quality to veteran writers for reading, and then send them to newspapers and magazines for publication after writing their reading opinions, or even publish a "Joint Publication," or have our company publish a "Special Issue" separately—is such an organizational mechanism appropriate? What are the difficulties? Are there any other better methods?</p>
<p>(7) If there is an urgent need for the above-mentioned mechanism to exist, then our company is willing to take the lead in organizing such a mechanism. But we do not know if you are willing to take on the work of reviewing. If you are willing, which department of works would you like to read? How many articles (how many words) can you read each month?</p>
<p>(8) When a specific plan for discovering newcomers can be realized, we plan to donate 30% to 40% of the royalties for the works of newcomers to the readers who review and correct them. Is this method appropriate? Is the remuneration too high or too low? After receiving the above-mentioned letters, the writers successively sent in their manuscripts. Except for Mr. Luo Hong, who sent a letter humbly stating that he could not answer, and Mr. Wang Xiyan from Fuzhou, who claimed that it was too late to publish, the local writers published approximately: Kong Lingjing, Wu Tian, Lin Danqiu, Shi Cun, Xu Diaoshou, Guo Shaochu, Xu Jie, Xin Yi, Zhao Jingshen, Liu Beifan, and Mr. Shi Yi. Among them, Mr. Ye Shengtao's article was already decided to be independent when the manuscript was being drafted, so Mr. Ye's article was written in the form of an essay, titled "A Decent Work."</p>
<p>Combining the opinions of the above-mentioned ten or so writers, although there are slight differences, they can be summarized into the following principles: (1) They all have great enthusiasm for the recommendation and cultivation of newcomers; (2) They hope to be able to organize a communication mechanism dedicated to cultivating newcomers, so that the works of newcomers have a large number of outlets; (3) When necessary, they are all willing to read the works of newcomers.</p>
<p>Now we are working with several related friends to organize a "Literary and Artistic News Agency," which will not only introduce the works of newcomers, but also introduce the works of veteran writers to distant cities. We hope that our efforts will especially benefit new writers.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 188</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>It's indeed a bit risky that only Yaoqun and Little Hucheng are prepared to go to Dongjiaomin Lane to spy on Pingzi (this is the assumed goal) because we have no report on the other side, and we don't know what's really going on. The Art of War says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Here, we are missing the condition of "knowing the enemy," so how can it not be considered risky? To put it strictly, this is a kind of "reckless action." Even if we don't cause a big disaster, I'm afraid we can't avoid a small failure.</p>
<p>Isn't Yaoqun's adventure a kind of "know the enemy" bald-headed action? If we want to "know the enemy," someone must go and explore first, right? But that's not the case. The work of exploration is done by people who specialize in exploration, and there are plans and steps, but we can't let Yaoqun do it. According to our method, we must send a small line to operate. Although small lines are not important figures, and their work is not considered major, they are feelers. Without a detailed report from the feelers, if we want to take action, that is blind advancement. Espionage work cannot be done blindly. Blind advancement is dangerous.</p>
<p>From this, we know that Hejian thinks it is dangerous because he is afraid that there may be enemies mixed in with this secret agency, and the person in charge is still kept in the dark.</p>
<p>After Hejian said the word "dangerous," I paid close attention to the expressions of Mr. Dai, Mr. W, and the manager. At this time, I only saw Mr. Dai glance at Mr. W intentionally or unintentionally, with a very clear "?" symbol in his eyes. And Mr. W quickly transmitted this symbol to the manager with his eyes. Just as the transmitted look touched the manager, the answer was already obtained on the manager's expression at the same time. This expression was just a slight shake of the head—a kind of strong self-confidence, indicating that Hejian's so-called danger was somewhat of an overestimation; there were no enemy agents infiltrated here.</p>
<p>"Do you have any discoveries?" Mr. W asked Hejian after getting the manager's expression of confidence.</p>
<p>"It seems like there is a little bit..." Hejian left his seat and slowly walked to the window. He turned around and leaned his back against the wall, attracting the attention of the room. "When I came back here, just as I was about to go home, a very luxurious car was in front of me, about fifty yards away. It stopped at our gate. A woman got out of the car, and in the blink of an eye, she took three steps and entered the gate here. By the time my car arrived at the gate, that car had already driven thirty or forty yards away, and I couldn't even see the license plate clearly."</p>
<p>"Was that woman tall, with a very slender figure?" Yaoqun asked, seemingly having seen something.</p>
<p>"Appearance, actions, somewhat resemble someone I knew in Japan!" Hejian seemed not to have heard Yaoqun's words, only focusing his eyes on the floor in front of his feet, thinking deeply, seemingly recalling a past fragment. After thinking for a while, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Yaoqun, stunned for a while, as if he had just cut off his memory and realized Yaoqun's question:</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Yao, … slender is slender, but not too tall," Hejian replied to Yaoqun, and then looked at us again, "When I got out of the car and rushed to the hall, there was no trace of her. I couldn't bother the duties of the hall, and I couldn't ask about the elevator..."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I felt somewhat aware. Hejian said that this person was someone he knew in Japan. I guess that this person is very likely Pingzi; she must have been tracking Hejian.</p>
<p>"About ten minutes since this lady came in?" The manager opened the handbook.</p>
<p>Hejian looked at his watch and nodded.</p>
<p>"Korean woman," the manager read the record on the booklet: "About twenty-four or five years old, surnamed Li, named Jinzi, related to the Korean 'Great League of the Han Nation'," reading this, he looked up at Mr. W again, seemingly getting Mr. W's consent, before turning to Guan Jian, "On the third floor, there is a Korean 'Great League' cadre living here, Mr. Liu Ping. He unfortunately damaged his eyes in a violent action... It's a pity!"</p>
<h3>Mountain Dwelling Grass—Random Notes on Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>1.  Wild Valley</p>
<p>Oh, how cold and dark is this mountain valley!</p>
<p>I am a childish shepherd, every day, I smell the scent of decaying grass in the mountains and fields. Taking advantage of the morning glow, I go out, and when dusk is sparse, I blow the flute of life's harvest, leading the flock back.</p>
<p>I deeply love this silent winter wild valley... Although, I am a bit cold, but the wilderness is a silver white, you say how bright and how solemn white it is!</p>
<p>I deeply love this continuous winter wild valley, because the soil here nourished me to grow up.</p>
<p>I hope, when will the wild valley be filled with smiling flowers. I hope when will there be hearty songs in the wild valley...</p>
<p>2.  Watchtower</p>
<p>Standing alone in the barren mountains, like a humble old man in rags, oh watchtower.</p>
<p>Wild grass is your green emerald skirt, white clouds are your gorgeous canopy, and flowers are your decorations:</p>
<p>I stand by the watchtower in the dusk, thinking for a long time. I remotely think of the heroes on the galloping battlefield in the past.</p>
<p>Towards the distance, I broadcast praises to the knights.</p>
<p>3.  Earthen House</p>
<p>The small earthen house is whipped and beaten by the wind, snow, and rain…</p>
<p>I live in the small earthen house with a heart full of tears and suffering, and I miss the days of flowering.</p>
<p>But, I still love this haven of life, and I will never give up my beloved small earthen house!</p>
<h3>A Spring Dream—Self-Funded Students</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>In July of last year, the government held a public examination for self-funded students to study abroad. Many people prepared their troops and horses, hoping for a smooth journey, to be named on the gold list, so that they could go abroad for a stroll. Then, they could return to their motherland and show off their skills.</p>
<p>At that time, the exchange rate for US dollars was 2020 yuan. According to many people's calculations, even if they couldn't get a government scholarship, they could study in the United States at their own expense. If they prepared to study for two years, enduring hardship and hard work, $3,000 US dollars could barely support them. That is to say, they only needed to prepare 6 million yuan to study abroad. Of course, this idea is not wrong. People with money don't need to plan everything, but those who study hard must plan.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, they went through a lot of procedures for physical examinations and registration. They also passed the exam with great difficulty. However, this "gold list" was late in coming. It was not published until the end of October, after the US dollar exchange rate was adjusted to 3350 yuan. Of course, the government-funded students were eagerly waiting to go abroad, but the self-funded students had already added more than half of the expenses out of thin air. The people who were preparing to study abroad were not all people who had many US dollars stored at home. Many of them were diligently saving their work salaries. Now, if they want to study abroad, they have to prepare at least 10 million yuan of national currency.</p>
<p>Their names are on the gold list, but both government-funded and self-funded students are still stuck in the country. The government wants the self-funded students to first submit their university certificates from foreign schools before issuing passports to them. They are like orphans, and no one cares for them. Of course, they cannot submit their university certificates for a while, so they cannot leave the country. As for the government-funded students, it is probably because the government is busy with public affairs. It seems that since they have benefited from the government, it is okay to waste some time. It was not until recently that the government issued a notice to gather for training in Nanjing next month. As for when they will go abroad and what schools they will enter, that is still anyone's guess.</p>
<p>However, the exchange rate has already been adjusted to 12,000 yuan. Apart from the children of profiteers and war profiteers in the United States, who can have such a large amount of money to study abroad? The self-funded students petitioned the Central Bank, but there was no follow-up. They petitioned the Ministry of Education, but there was no follow-up.</p>
<p>However, a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came: "By order, the issuance of passports for all government-funded and self-funded students studying abroad is temporarily suspended." It was casually dismissed with a stroke of the pen.</p>
<p>Half a year has passed, and everything has become a bubble. Since the government does not want anyone to study abroad, why teach so many people to waste time and wait in vain? Are the students really being used as sacrifices to decorate the facade?</p>

<h3>"Apply What You Learn"</h3>
<p>— Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>Allow Traitors to Substitute Translations for Assignments</p>
<p>Knowledge and personality, morality, are absolutely two different things. Just as many people's words and actions cannot be consistent, a person with profound knowledge often has a personality and morality that are the opposite. An elder with a noble personality and admirable morality may not necessarily have good knowledge. To measure a person's personality and morality with knowledge, or to measure a person's knowledge with personality and morality, will disappoint you. Knowledge, personality, and morality cannot be weighed on the same scale, although there are exceptions, but these exceptions are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, traitors who have lost their integrity and betrayed their country, selling their country for glory, have mostly had good knowledge. "Only intelligent people will make big mistakes and commit big crimes." Their actions are precisely a betrayal of their full of talent. Among the traitors, there are also many talented and knowledgeable people, such as Zhou Zuoren, Zhou Fohai, and Liang Hongzhi. Many people feel sorry for them, but the crimes they committed are difficult to wash away even with the water of the West River. This is also the result of "knowledge not being used properly," a definite proof that knowledge and personality and morality cannot be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>According to reports: In the High Court Detention Center of this city, there are many traitors who have received higher education and are proficient in foreign languages. The court has now set up separate venues in the prison, allowing them to substitute translations for other assignments, and assigning them writing, translation, and proofreading work according to their academic qualifications and expertise.</p>
<p>In the past, the traitors used their knowledge improperly and "slipped up into eternal regret," having a big dream. After waking up from the dream, they were imprisoned. After "thinking about their mistakes in prison," they thought it was a pity to abandon their talents. So they wanted to take advantage of their prison years to show their strengths. They actually invited the authorities to approve, so that they could be worry-free and concentrate on writing in the venues specially set up for them in the prison, burying themselves in their desks and concentrating on writing, in order to relieve the long prison life.</p>
<p>In that kind of environment, engaging in translation and other work, thinking about it from the perspective of the traitors, this situation is really embarrassing. If they had been able to make good use of their knowledge earlier and behaved well, how could they be where they are today!</p>
<p>The traitors who are in shackles are doing the work of "applying what they have learned." I wonder what countless people in society who "use their knowledge improperly" will think when they hear this. Is it shame? Or is it vigilance?</p>
<p>"Poverty makes writers work harder." How should we say that the traitors are "working hard" to write articles in prison?</p>
<h3>Thinking of Home—Written After the "No Burial Place" News</h3>
<p>— Wailing Poor Ghosts</p>
<p>Living is pitiful, dying is miserable, no place to live, no coffin to die; even more, no place to bury bones, how good it was to be buried in the soil in those years</p>
<p>Delaying cremation, is it empty talk? Who knows that life and death after victory are difficult? The big shots frown: Be careful of bad luck in June</p>
<p>Note: The cost of a coffin is definitely not something a poor family can buy. "Peace in the grave" is a joke about entering air-raid shelters during air raids. Someone jokingly replied "act according to the situation."</p>
<h3>Unable to Survive</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>In a small room, three people live: Chen, Zhou, and Li. Chen is a student studying abroad, and Zhou and Li are both college students. One works in the tax bureau, and the other is a newspaper reporter. One is a university professor. During the day, they all work outside. At 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening, for the sake of sleep, they involuntarily gather together. Besides reading books and newspapers, they start "pure conversation."</p>
<p>There is no fixed goal for pure conversation: the gold case, the corruption case, the Liang Renda case, the Lunan battle, Fu Sinian's big cannon, the freezing of the living index, the rising prices of daily necessities, Wang Yunwu's talk about promoting policies regardless of results, the Soviet Union letting the United States take over the Japanese Pacific islands, foreign affairs, domestic news, family economy, personal life, nothing is not talked about. The content of the conversation includes politics, economics, law, culture, society, and science. At times, except for the three people, there is no fourth person nearby. They speak freely and discuss the world, which is quite in line with the "freedom of speech" in the constitution and the "democratic" principles of democratic countries.</p>
<p>The three people's monthly salaries are all around 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Mr. Zhou is not yet married, but he has to bear the tuition fees of his fiancée. No matter how simple the wedding ceremony is, it always requires a sum of start-up money. If his wife has one or two children after marriage and there is no one to take care of them, he will have to hire a maid, which is a huge expense. In today's world, where the cost of living is rising day by day, he can only sigh and shout "unable to marry." Mr. Li's family is not in Shanghai, and the cost of eating "guest meals" is huge, coupled with social obligations, he shouts "unable to maintain." Mr. Chen has the burden of seven people, including his parents, wife, and children. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all concentrated on him. He struggles hard and says: "When you are not satisfied with your work, you can resign, but there is only one 'head of household' that cannot be resigned. You cannot sell your wife, and you cannot dismiss your children. You have to bite the bullet and live by pawning things, sighing 'unable to survive'."</p>
<p>The result of the pure conversation is inconclusive. Scholars rebelling are not feared by others; suicide lacks courage. Everyone sighs "unable to survive."</p>
<h3>"Tarzan" is Old</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>"Tarzan's Desert Victory," which is showing in the big Shanghai, is a hodgepodge put together from many things. It has Nazi spies, monsters, a little swimming and rope work, and strings them together into a story, which naturally gives a stale feeling. Tarzan's age may not have increased by many years, but the spirit of the Tarzan films is already old. In terms of attracting audiences, it has become a spent arrow, because it has made no progress in any aspect. Perhaps the only improvement is that the little chimpanzee Cheeta can do somersaults on the rope.</p>
<p>The female lead, Maureen O'Sullivan, when comforting Little Tarzan during prayers and in a few other scenes when she hears that Tarzan has a sweetheart in America, has some redeeming expressions. The rest is very forced. Tarzan himself, of course, cannot be said to be acting; he is just a strongman.</p>

<h3>Skill Seen in Difficulty – New Talk on Couplets, No. 6</h3>
<p>— Ting Song</p>
<p>A professor at Fu Jen Catholic University is a madman. He always speaks grandiosely and writes voluminously, always saying that there are no difficult problems in the world. One day, a female student earnestly requested a couplet. The professor laughed and said, "There is no such format. The female student's words are about trying to persuade her sister's husband through her younger sister." Those sitting with him discussed it and said, "Brother, you have a difficult problem today." The professor bravely said, "What difficulty is there? But there must be facts." The female student said, "Her father and her sister's husband are both professors at Fu Jen Catholic University and get along well. Therefore, they are bonded by marriage. The son-in-law lives with his father-in-law. After the incident, the father-in-law stayed at the school, but the son-in-law lost his job. Life became more and more expensive. He was old, and the father-in-law's family burden was also heavy. He often said to people, 'It is already an exception that I support my married daughter and grandson. To also support an unemployed son-in-law is beyond my ability.' The son-in-law heard this and angrily left for the rear in Guangxi Province, where he obtained a position at the Guangxi Provincial University. He went last winter and died this autumn. Moreover, the sister gave birth to two children after her marriage, one boy and one girl. These are the facts. Can you use them?" The professor immediately picked up his pen and wrote a couplet, which read: "The deceased has long gone, and I grieve that my sister endures hardship and bitterness, still burdening her gray-haired old father; life is like a bubble, I hate that her weak body is kind-hearted but lacks strength, making it difficult to help her orphaned children." He told the female student, "Aunt and brother-in-law are like sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law who do not communicate, so there is no format for persuasion. If the meaning is to mourn the sister, then it is not difficult to mourn her husband." Everyone present was very admiring. The next day, the female student came with her middle sister, requesting another couplet, because the female students were three sisters, mourning the deceased, who was their eldest sister. The professor said that the facts had been exhausted and he could not write another one, and refused. The female students insisted and said, "My sister's husband died in Guangxi, and the previous couplet was sought there." The professor, without thinking, wrote another couplet, which read: "Thousands of miles of bad news flew in, I grieve that my sister is widowed and alone, with infinite sorrow filling my sister's chest; one hundred years of time pass easily, I hope that her two nephews will soar like mosquitoes and rise like phoenixes, and be able to establish themselves early and comfort their parents." The previous couplet used idioms and was very superb. This couplet is even more sincere in mourning the sister, and the phoenix and dragon are paired with "sister's chest" and "parents' heart," the antithesis is appropriate. It can be said that it is all perfect, coming easily. I said that both couplets are natural and generous, which is really not easy. It belongs to skill seen in difficulty, and the matter is also very interesting. Even now, thinking of it, I still can't help but laugh.</p>
<h3>What is the Benefit of Much Wealth? - Occasional Thoughts on Reading History</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>Occasionally reading the History of the Ming Dynasty, during the Jia Shen Incident, "An order was given to register the meritorious relatives, to collect contributions to the military pay. The eunuch Xu Gao was dispatched, and he argued that the Duke of Jiading, Zhou Kui, should take the lead. Kui declined, saying he had nothing. Gao wept and advised him again and again, but Kui responded with vague words. Gao angrily stood up and said: 'The in-laws of the emperor are like this, the country is finished! What is the benefit of much wealth?'" "The eunuch Wang Zhi Xin was the richest, and the emperor ordered him to only offer ten thousand gold. All the eunuchs wrote in large letters on their doors: 'This house is for sale urgently.'"</p>
<p>We see: as relatives of the imperial family and close ministers of the emperor, when the country's situation was critically urgent, they did not understand the principle of "when the country falls, the family is not safe," and only guarded their money like dogs gnawing bones, unwilling to take out a little to supplement the military pay and save the country; not only were they unwilling, but they also pretended to be poor by using "This house is for sale urgently" as a guise. These people were blinded by greed, lost their minds, and it is really hateful, infuriating, and laughable.</p>
<p>Therefore, it also makes me think of the misers who love money like their lives. They store their excess money in warehouses, letting it sit in the "cold palace," unwilling to contribute a little to the national economy and people's livelihood. In this way, what difference does it make whether that money is yours or not yours? What relationship does that money have with you? It only buries its useful purpose, and even harms the country and the people.</p>
<p>If we say that the insatiable greed of misers is nothing more than to have a happy life and teach their descendants, then there are many people whose wealth is already immeasurable, and even if they live extravagantly and luxuriously for thousands of years, they will still not be able to use it all up, yet they still desperately "absorb" it. Why?</p>
<p>If we say it is for the sake of leaving an inheritance for their descendants, then I must bring up a few old historical words: Li Guang of the Han Dynasty said it well: if descendants are "virtuous and wealthy, it will harm their ambition; if they are foolish and wealthy, it will increase their mistakes." Leaving wealth to one's descendants is far不如积点功德為好。better than accumulating some merit for one's descendants.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of much wealth? Those in the world who have a "money fetish" can see through a little, right?</p>
<h3>Qin Yi in Ying Yunwei's Directing "No Name"</h3>
<h3>On Friendship</h3>
<p>— Xue Hua</p>
<p>I have had many close friends, they are just like the air I must breathe every day, it relieves you of many mental and physical pains that come upon you; therefore, every time I think of friends, I am always moved to tears.</p>
<p>People cannot live in isolation! People must live a communal life. And friends are the most regular, warmest, and most human symbol of these community activities.</p>
<p>However, friendship often deteriorates with the turbulence of social life; their evaluation of you, due to the impact of various aspects, often makes them very cold, very sophisticated, and very "realistic." All interactions seem like merchants doing "business," measuring the importance of friendship with you in a "transactional" way.</p>
<p>When he has a request of you, he only revolves around you, emitting an instinctive "um-um-" sound, flattering, tactful, low, and kind, telling you his request; so, you are moved by him, "your whole body is moved," ah! Friendship should be cherished!</p>
<p>But the evolution of climate and weather cannot compare to the speed of change of these "gentle and low voices," they can freeze from high heat into ice.</p>
<p>They will weave a net around you, drawing a deep, bottomless chasm. Once you have a request of him, he will coldly shake his head at you and say:</p>
<p>"There's no way!"</p>
<p>In this "cold" "temperature," I often feel that I have frozen into "ice." "Obey the law"</p>
<p>"Obey the law" I forget my people.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As he was about to approach the middle-aged man, he clenched his right fist and hammered his back and waist a few times.</p>
<p>"It seems that we young people can't do it!" A bitter smile appeared on his face, but he still looked very handsome. "Mr. Tian, you are really getting stronger as you get older!"</p>
<p>Mr. Tian smiled slightly, but his eyes kept looking around.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Old Zhu is gone!" He looked very puzzled.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Everyone else is busy, but he insisted on going out to find someone..." The person with the high nose and curly hair quickly guessed what was on the other's mind. "Mr. Tian, you're looking for him to rehearse the living newspaper for tomorrow, right?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Miss Zhu and the others are all waiting downstairs!" Mr. Tian frowned, turned around, moved his legs wearing high-top boots, and walked towards the staircase, muttering to himself, "Old Zhu is enthusiastic, just a bit messy!..." After a few steps, he suddenly stopped as if he had remembered something, turned around, and asked loudly, "Where did Old Zhu go just now? The script is still with him!"</p>
<p>"He went to find Xu... Xu Shaoming." The person with the curly hair seemed to have some difficulty saying it.</p>
<p>The person in military uniform obviously did not understand what he was talking about.</p>
<p>"Xu Shaoming? The general manager of Zhongfu..." He began to think.</p>
<p>Among the dozen or so people counting money, a short man with an exceptionally unsmiling face walked out.</p>
<p>"Tian Guangsheng, the script is here. Old Zhu left it for you!" He walked towards a bamboo bookcase in the corner of the room, opened the door, and took out a roll of mimeographed material. His left leg was a bit lame, and his body swayed a lot when he walked, but he wasn't slow. Others looked like he was having some difficulty. He handed the script to Mr. Tian and immediately limped back to the big table to continue helping everyone count money; he seemed completely uninterested in other things.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian took the script and looked at the paper wrapped around it, and his heart was happy again.</p>
<p>"I don't think Old Zhu would be that confused!" He walked towards the staircase again. "He went to Xu Shaoming to donate money, leaving a note telling me to only give him a part in the play."</p>
<p>The sound of high-top boots echoed up and down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tian likes Old Zhu, who is a real monster!" The person with the high nose and curly hair showed a displeased expression, retreated from the door again, and said to a person counting money standing near him, "Old Li, are you almost done? Let's go eat first!"</p>
<p>Old Li obviously had the same idea.</p>
<p>"Sorry, these stacks of mine are all five thousand yuan, you guys total them up! I'll leave with Old Zhong first!" He pushed the four or five stacks of banknotes tied together with rubber bands to the person next to him, wiped his hands on his trousers, and turned to follow Old Zhong and left.</p>
<p>"Dinner will be served here soon! Are you still leaving?" Three or four people asked them from behind.</p>
<p>"Going home to eat!" Old Zhong answered vaguely, without turning his head, and the two of them quickly went downstairs.</p>
<p>"Can Old Zhong eat here? Alas! He's in the boss class!" The short man with a worried face said in a sarcastic tone. In the middle, he inexplicably let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>"He was definitely very tired from shouting today, maybe he just wants to go back to rest." Someone gave this explanation for Old Zhong. (2)</p>
