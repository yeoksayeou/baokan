<h3>聯合國第二屆大會　巴西代表主持揭幕　美將要求派代表團調查韓國局勢　王外長今廣播會議情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：一九四七年度之聯合國全體大會，十六日正式揭幕，各方希望美，蘇間日益尖銳化之矛盾能在此次大會中獲得緩和。大會開幕式，由巴西首席代表阿朗哈主持，阿氏銀髮斑斑，儀態極佳。渠向大會所致之開會辭中有云：聯合國大會之成敗，將決定世界走向和平之路，抑走向戰爭之路。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：出席聯合國大會之蘇聯代表團首席代表維辛斯基，十六日乘「伊　莎伯皇后」號抵達紐約。渠向記者發表談話稱：蘇聯將竭盡所能，解決聯合國機構當今所面臨之各項困難及嚴重問題。此等問題，在相互諒解與善意協商之下，當能獲致解決。有詢以莫洛托夫是否將赴紐約出席聯合國大會者，維辛斯基答稱：渠並無所知，並謂：目下係渠任蘇聯代表團團長，以後如何，尙難斷言。今日與維辛斯　同機抵紐約者，有英國，比利時，波蘭及盧森堡等國之代表團。英國務大臣麥克尼爾發表談話稱：否決權之被濫用，已屢見不鮮，但目下英國不擬要求修改有關否決權之規定。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕英外相貝文，以國內事務繁忙，且須準備十一月間在倫敦召開之四國外畏會議，或不克親自出席聯大。紐約報紙咸認，本屆聯大將爲美，蘇勢力之試騐塲合。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕消息靈通人士稱：美國現已決定要求派遣聯合國代表團，前往調査朝鮮局勢，並提出朝鮮成立一個臨時政府，以實行該國政治統一之計劃。據稱：美國此一聲明，可能於馬歇爾國務卿本週內率領美八代表團參加聯大會議時，在紐約加以宣布。</p>
<p>出席聯大常會我國代表名單</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕我國出席聯合國大會第二屆常會之代表名單如下，首席代表外長王世杰，第二爲駐美大使顧維鈞，第三爲安理會代表蔣廷黻、第四爲經濟社會理事會代表張彭春，第五爲駐加拿大大使兼托　理事會代表劉鍇，副代表為安理會我副代表夏晉麟，聯合國我代表團顧問徐淑希，張忠紱，外交部顧問朱世明，朱氏係出席倫敦太平洋學會年會後抵此者。代表團顧問為外交部情報司長張沉長，外交部條約司長胡慶育，靑年黨代表周謙冲，民社黨代表馮今白，經社理事會助理代表楊永淸，聯合國中國代表團顧問鄭震宇，魏學仁，蕭　。專門委員外交部人事處帮辦郭長祿，行政院新聞局北平辦事處主任朱新民，遠東委員會我代表團專門顧問劉選粹，聯合國我代表團專門委員林咸讓，繆經田，顧問孫毓棠，査修，秘書長我駐美大使顧問崔存璘，新聞組長行政院新聞局北美辦事處主任倪源卿。</p>
<p>〔又電〕王外長應聯合國當局之請，將就聯大會第二屆常會情形向國內發表播講。廣播時間定爲十六日下午七時（紐約時間），即南京時間十七日上午八時，將由檀香山廣播電台轉播。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十五日電〕中國王外長稱：歐洲及遠東和平必須早日恢復，否則局勢將一發不可收拾，本屆大會最爲重要，聯合國機構之盛衰，將取決於此。王氏稱：對於否決權問題，並無意見發表。</p>
<h3>中國不能長此徬徨　孫科談外交政策　中蘇兩國可以重歸友好　魏使報告提出後我將作重要決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕國民政府副主席孫科十六日單獨接見合衆社記者宣稱，中國政府在獲悉魏德邁將軍向杜魯門總統提出報吿之結果後，將硏究中國與美國聯合有利抑與蘇聯聯合爲有利。若中國被迫傾向蘇聯，則政府與中共勢必能獲得一和平解決。</p>
<p>孫副主席申言，蘇聯目前之對華政策，乃建築於恐懼上，蓋美蘇間一旦公開衝突，中國將站在美國方面。若中國不與美國密切聯繫，蘇聯諒將對中國採取較友善之態度。孫科又稱，蘇聯欲使中國成爲其友善之鄰邦，但不願意中國與有成爲其可能敵國之强國聯盟，故中國必須在兩强之問掙扎，使其自身能適合於目前以及長久將來得最有利之地位。世界各國，並非爲情感而締結同盟，每一國家皆考慮其自國之民族利益爲其最重要之點。孫科指出兩項改進中蘇關係之途徑稱：</p>
<p>第一，莫斯科必須抑制中共之武裝反抗，並協助促使東北及中共佔領區與中國各地統一。第二，將大連交與中國管理，幷依照中蘇條約，共管旅順。「如蘇聯眞正能履行中蘇條約，幷充分表示其友誼，足使中國重行考慮其對蘇之態度」。渠解釋蘇聯過去對中國之行爲之主要原因，乃　於其對中美關係太密切而感不快。蘇聯拒絕放棄大述及在東北之行動皆係其不愉快之表示，但此非蘇聯欲搗毀吾人之施也。孫科鄭重指稱，政策之轉向，正等待魏德邁報吿之提出。此有待於美國自作決定。中國不能長此徬徨，吾人須有更有效之政策，以指導吾人之未來。吾人應明白，蘇聯觀點，蘇聯恐懼美國指導中國政策。吾國與蘇聯政府之歧見，主要由於蘇聯未能遵守中蘇條約之條款，蘇聯如不恐懼一且公開衝突時，中國將變爲美國同盟國，蘇聯或許願實施該約。</p>
<p>孫氏承認中國所設法建立之政府形式，在思想上與蘇聯制度有其不相容之點。但稱，如蘇聯不干涉中國內政，吾人能友好相處。</p>
<h3>日賠償工業機器　首批即抽籤分配</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕日本先期賠償物資第一批一業機器，定九月中旬由中·菲·英·荷四國抽籤分配，經部第一批預備配給民營工廠之機器，現正按照已經塡送之機器卡片分類編號，製成統計，供抽籤後各單位照比例分配之根據。</p>
<h3>林語堂談話　評魏使聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕記者曾以我政府對魏德邁所發表之聲明，徵詢林語堂氏意見。林氏稱，通貨膨脹及其引起之困難，亦爲過去八九年內我政府對戰爭所付代價之一部份，同盟國各政府對於我國之困難及其與共黨作戰之性質及國際意義，應稍加推索。質言之，使共黨之虎在中國抬頭者美國人也，現虎已坐大，美國人士確有除虎之責。美國之表白意見，實屬無用，如欲援華，則必須見諸行動。若干美國人士曾於過去之四年中致力工作，欲使中國爲共黨所控制，俾於下次戰爭中，中國將與共產黨國家共同作戰，而不復與美國共同作戰，余希望美國人民現能多加想象</p>
<h3>魏使飛華府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社檀香山十六日電〕魏德邁將軍定十六日下午飛返華府。魏將軍係於十六日晨抵達此間，並與中太平洋陸海軍軍官舉行秘密會議。</p>
<h3>政院追認撥款　急賑皖省難民</h3>
<p>組臨時救濟委會辦理</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕皖省匪災慘重，政院特於本月十二·十三兩日分別令飭財部，撥發匪災急賑款廿億元，匯交皖省府妥速籌救，此款已於十六日政務會中提出報吿，並予追認。撥交皖省府，其配放則由該省府會同省參議會及有關機關·團體與社會公正人士，組織臨時救濟委會辦理</p>
<h3>莫斯科電台廣播　中蒙邊境又衝突</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕莫斯科電台昨夜廣播搭斯社消息稱，新疆中國軍隊與外蒙人民共和國在貝提克伯格圖一帶又起邊境衝突。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕莫斯科電台報吿塔斯社外　首都庫倫電稱，外蒙外交部，列舉中國曾侵犯外蒙邊疆七次：第一次在七月三十一，最近一次在八月廿四日。</p>
<h3>孫夫人聲明　否認競選國代</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕孫夫人宋慶齡女士，昨（十六日）發表聲明，堅決否認報載彼將參加十一月國大代表競選之消息。夫人謂：「此項新聞完全不確，余無意於參加政治競選及政府工作，此外，該項消息發自廣州，而余在廣州並無代表及正式住址」云。孫夫人現爲中國福利基金委員會主席，現正積極從事於此全國性之救濟工作。</p>
<h3>宋子文由滬飛京　報告捐產經過　建設銀公司股權清冊亦携往</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕宋子文十六日午十一時由滬乘機飛京，將出席十七日晨舉行之中常會，報吿捐獻其中國建設銀公司股權之經過。聞其股權淸册，亦已携來。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國建設銀公司某高級職員稱：宋子文氏捐獻之股票價値，因淮南路礦公司及揚子電氣公司等股票，均未在證交公開買賣，故其時値需由專家將各事業之資產估價，並計算其營利能力後，方能有準確之決定。建設銀公司將專爲此事召開董事會一次，時間當在宋氏回京公開其詳細捐獻辦法之後。三種股票所代表之事業，均有光明之展望，淮南煤礦現幾成爲華中用煤之主要供給者，其經濟價値不問可知，但在敵僞時期設備頗受損失，補充須動用外匯。漢口電器公司戰時亦有損失，揚子電氣公司則並無重大損失。電氣事業略帶獨佔性質，且各地均有電荒現象，故事業之展望良好，其股票之估價，自較一般實業爲高。</p>
<h3>張厲生報告選務　綏區選另定補救辦法　憲政促進會開聯席會議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕選舉總事務所主席委員張厲生，十六日晨在憲政實施促進委會上解答各委員對選務上之詢問，略如下列各點：（一）關於選舉法令之解釋，限由司法機關辦理，選舉事務上如有於法不合時，選所應負其責。（二）綏靖區或有戰事之地區，如東北·華北·蘇北·皖·豫等省地區之普選因事實問題，不能依法辦理，須另定辦法以資補救，因此次普選，亟期冊為眞正之普先，而不欲因少數地區清況特殊以至冲淡普選之義意。選舉總事務所頃已以調査所得報吿國府，計全國有五百餘縣不能依據現行法律辦理選舉，國府已考慮及此，並訂定辦法，惟尙須待立法院完成立法程序公佈後，始能施行。（三）關於政黨提名辦法中，必設法使若干服務社會多年及貢獻較大之人士，能被推選。此點應研究若干具體意見，提交政府採納。（四）關於各地工會國大代表名額分配之決定，張氏表示不能答覆，應視各地情形而定。（五）文盲之寫票問題，有人提出詢間是否可由選所人員代爲書寫？張氏答以選所已規定選民可於投票時臨時請托任何人代爲書寫。（六）選民登記事，於本年二月初即通知各級政府辦理，如能即日趕辦，可按期完成。（七）政黨提名，對候補人之硬性規定問題，張氏解釋稱，政黨提名僅能使該黨黨員遵守黨紀，並非約束他人，與一般競選無關，且當選人由選票決定，候補人自應爲次多數。（八）官吏如有於地方冒充工會會員參加競選事，選民可于以制止。（九）立委·監委及國大代表之競選，每一人均可同時進行，惟前兩者必須分別在區域或職業團體兩部份選出，如國大代表係區域選舉，則立委應爲職業國體，反之如立委係區域，則國大必屬職業團體，亦即同一範圍不能進行兩種身份之競選。至監委則爲間接選舉，自不相衝突。</p>
<p>〔又電〕憲政促進會十六日晨舉行第四次聯席會議，由會長孫科主席，通過送請政府酌辦案三件：（一）請政府依據實際預算發給各省市縣選舉經費，以利憲政實施案。（二）請政府通令各地方禁止候選人宴客以杜選舉舞弊案。（三）請政府提高公務員本薪，以收調整待過之實敎案。茲誌該案預擬辦法如次：　任職月薪改爲一千二百元，特任職改爲一千元，簡任一級職改爲八百八十元，薦任一級職改爲五百四十元，委任一級職改爲三百元，簡·薦·委各級職及雇員等月薪，均比照提高。</p>
<h3>東北國境界標被移動　中央令調查眞相　並將派機飛東蒙散發政令文告</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十六日電〕東北問題多，尤以國際性事件惹人注目。近據關係方面消息，據報西北部國境綫界標，被外蒙方面向東遷移深入我國境內，聞中央已有令到達此間，從事調査，以明究竟。又東蒙與外蒙間關係頗神秘，傳外蒙派有幹部控制僞東蒙自治政府。另說外　促東　徐謀發展，免遭外忌，聞我負責機關對東北蒙旗發展頗注意，近將派飛機至北部散蒙漢文政令文吿。</p>
<h3>加飛機百餘架　批准售予我國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社渥太華十五日電〕加拿大政府發言人稱，外交部已批准由戰時物資公司以雙引擎蚊子式飛機一百五十架售予中國政府，戰時英國空軍曾以此種飛機向德國各城市實行白晝轟炸。加拿大空軍部認為此種飛機現已陳舊，最近已將五百架宣布爲剩餘物資，由官方出售。此次出售係根據一九四五年協定，規定加拿大以若干接濟品運往中國，飛機亦在其內。售價未宣布，蓋細則尙待談判。加拿大希望以美金付教，政府發言人力言，此項交易純爲商業性質，絕非加拿大對於中國政策表示贊同之意。加拿大向抱禁止以軍火售予交戰各國之政策，但不以爲此次剩餘飛機之出售違反此種政策，蓋以一百五十架飛機，不足以決定軍事勝負。發言人對於此種交易是否將繼續進行，諉稱不知、但力言加拿大不希望從事軍火貿易。</p>
<h3>蘇北匪圖南竄　沿江防務加強</h3>

<p>〔本市訊〕交通部因隴海鐵路西段行車受阻，爲維持西安鄭州兩地交通起見，聞已令飭中國航空公司及中央航空公司，增闢西安鄭州航班，以維交通。據悉：中國航空公司自本月七日起，已派有專機，逐日飛行兩地，每日往返數次，茲奉部令，擬再增闢西鄭間航班，每週三次，以便運輸。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕平津保三角地共匪已化整爲零，國軍已完全控制雄·霸·新鎭地區，文安西方續有掃蕩戰。</p>
<h3>陳明仁將軍印象</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠</p>
<p>民國十四年的惠州之役，是國民革命軍討平陳烱明，奠定全粤的眾要關鍵。在圍城之後繼以猛攻，一個廿二歲的小排長身先士卒，爬上城頭舉起軍旗一搖，鼓舞了士氣，攻克了賊巢，這小排長就是陳明仁又過廿一點　二年後，以堅守四平街而威名四振的兩顆星將軍。惠州一役，使蔣總司令賞識了他的勇敢和機智，四平街之戰更表現了他的堅定力，廿二年前他得到一個金獎章，廿二年後他得到的是盡人皆知的令譽，相同的是這些殊榮都是冒生侖危險換來的。</p>
<p>穿一身公家發的人字布料軍官服，右胸襟上扣着一顆去年東北祝賀蔣主席六秩大壽的紀念章，洗不褪的風塵顏色的面孔上，有一簇旣黑且密的異常堅定的鬍子，這就是陳明仁將軍，他說話有一點湖南口音，語氣永遠帶着果斷：</p>
<p>「你們貴報在東北有一位　淸濤是吧！」他劈頭這樣說，「我們見過。」我們就這樣開始談話。</p>
<p>說到四平街保衛戰，陳將軍似乎比一般這沒有興趣，他輕輕的笑了笑：</p>
<p>「一共四十二天……他沒有多說甚麽，因爲報紙上的報道已够多了，而他那風塵的面色與堅定的鬍子，給人的印象更是勝得過千言萬語。他說：</p>
<p>「東北現在很平靖，上次匪軍吃了虧後，一直沒有能力和阻量再來搗亂。陳總長到了東北，一切自然更穩定不少，前天我見到蔣主席，他並且和夫人一道留我吃晚飯，對四平街保衛戰的經過，以及東北近來的匪勢問得很詳細，他還放了我三個星期的假，讓我回湖南老家去一趟，我十年不曾回云了呢」！</p>
<p>陳明仁是共產黨的死對頭，民國十八年在他醴陵故鄕，共產黨（那時叫「赤匪」）殺了他的父親，又過了十八年，東北的共匪又差一點要了他的命，他弟弟陳明信在四平被俘，至今還沒消息，公事私仇，加在一起，他是和共匪拚完了的。</p>
<p>「他們敢打就來，我們早又補充準備好了」！。</p>
<p>他摸摸他那一簇烏黑的小鬍子。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州十六日電〕輸出入管委會華南分會，十六日上午成立，中央銀行總裁兼該會主委張家璈特於十五日由滬飛來主持。張氏致訓時，指出華南經濟特殊情形，幷就政策方針作詳明指示。該分會轄區爲粵桂閩三省，原有貴州業務暫仍辦理，幷在梧州，厦門，汕頭，湛江，海口五地分設辦事處。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕張嘉璈頃對記者發表談話稱。渠來比係主持輸出入管理會華南分會成立與視察中央分行行務。該會成立主要任務爲：（一）研究以經濟力量，輔助政府取締走私，使出口外匯歸諸政府，如走私减少，黑市外匯亦可减少，僑匯亦不浪費他流。（二）調查當地民生及公用事業必需品需要，以作限額根據。（三）調查走私情形及研究應付辦法。（四）宣達中央經濟政策政令及轉陳地方困難於中央。（五）注意僑匯增收，研究改善辦法。（六）注意香港經濟金融政策變遷，採取必要措施，隨時維護國家與地方利益，同時保持粵港良好經濟關係。張氏並稱：消滅黃金外匯黑市及走私問題，主要全賴人民之心理轉移，必須信仰政府，犧牧個人小利，愛護國家，始有辦法。張氏對外傳將發五萬元鈔事，謂全屬謠傳。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕據聯總官員吿記者稱，聯總署長魯克斯，將於本月杪赴華，與中國政府討論今年年底結束之對中國救濟計劃下之未了業務。據發晉人稱：魯克斯起程日期未定，惟計劃於月杪赴華，調查聯總在華工作之推進，並決定在中國方面聯總是否應堅持其分配時在政治上毫無歧視之政策。傳聯總正與我政府談判，以圖就物資分配共產黨控制區域問題，獲致協議。此間觀察家認爲如不能獲得協議，則聯總九國中央委員會或將請中國政府發放指定運往共產黨區域約値六百萬美元之供應，或將要求在對中國之救濟計劃中，减少一部份，使聯總方面之態度，認爲中國政府與共產黨間關於運輸物資至共產黨區域未能獲致協議，不應歸罪於國民政府。又中國救濟計劃下之未了業務，約有藥品供應三千萬元，以及善後所需之機械等項，如何處理，尙待魯克斯向中央委員會建議。</p>
<h3>東北與關內貿易　調節辦法再修正　行轅擬定抑平物價方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十六日電」東北與關內貿易，原須受東北行轅經委會頒布之「修訂商貨出入調節暫行辦法」之限制，該會爲適應東北當前經濟情勢，調節東北物資，輔助工礦復工起見，特將上項辦法重新修正，並於今公佈。輸出品分爲三類：（一）自由輸出類，爲東北區內數量極　，而其他各地需要者，得自由輸出東北境外，不必申請許可。（二）託運輸出類，爲東北區內數量雖豐，而本區域內亦頗需要者，其價値在流通券五萬元或重量在五十公斤以上，輸出前應申請，經核准後，辦理託運。（三）禁止輸出類，因除公營機關之需要，經呈經委會核准特許者，概不得託運。此次修正，實際上已將該會前所公佈而迄未收效之經濟緊急措施方案，無形取消，蓋該方案中並無自由輸出類之規定也。至於原來禁止轍出之大豆，煤，均將另案請示核辦。至於經濟緊急措施方案中關於緊縮信用等金融措施，仍繼續有效。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十六日電〕東北行轅對抑平物價，下最大決心，取締囤積，管理外匯，均已擬妥方案。與外匯有關之大豆，亦採有效措置，雖中長路修復，亦將予以局部凍結，故長市大豆價格，昨午後起價已下挫，每斤十餘元。</p>
<h3>經部謀增加紙產　約集有關機關開會商討　擬具改進意見呈院核示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕經濟部爲求增加造紙產量，近貨約集有關機關及造紙專家開會商討，會中對目前造紙工業困難，曾予檢討，並擬具改進意見。我造紙業最感缺乏者；僞原料及材料，計國內每日所需紙漿約四百噸，而銅絲布及毛毯幾完全仰給於國外輸入，國內所製毛毯未盡適用，我國內木　未能大量生產，四川各廠所產木槳，除一部分製鈔票紙外，餘尙不足本省所霍。台灣木漿及蔗渣紙漿，除供本省製報紙外，可以一部份運滬，惟絨維太短。天津及東北之錦州與營口紙漿廠，均以蘆　爲主要原料，尙未開工，近有主張將上述紙漿廠內遷者，惟一時不易實施。至於蘇聯易貨時將紙漿列入主要項目之建議，係屬治標辦法，其治本辦法，仍須自行設廠。查我國每年所耗購於紙槳及紙張之外匯，約一千八百萬美元，如以此項外匯設立紙漿廠，則今後每年所節省者當不止此數。耗費於銅絲布·毛毯者，約各五十萬美元，如以此項分設銅絲布廠及毛毯廠各一所，則十八月後即可出貨，足供中國目前所有紙廠之需，而每年所省外匯，亦恰合上數。現正分別呈院核示，並提請資委會會同有關機關研究採擇實施中。較珠江大橋長達五倍</p>
<h3>廣州西南大鐵橋　半年內興工續建　較珠江大橋長達五倍</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十五日電〕廣州西南大鐵橋，橫跨珠江河面，爲溝通粵漢路與廣三路交通之重要建設，戰前已完成一部份橋墩工程，光復後以財力枯竭，迄未續建。本年四月間，市府與省府及粵漢路局協商建築，八月初決定委託中國橋樑公司辦理，所需鋼樑，由路局呈請交部撥用，工程費由中橋公司墊借，將來在通過該橋之火車汽車征收費內償還，合約已於九月一日簽訂，規定簽約後半年內興工。全部鎮　運　後，六個月內完成。該橋橫跨珠江及其支流河面，較珠江大鐵橋長達五倍，橋面分設火車汽車行人路，爲西南最大機樑。</p>
<h3>侵佔軍用槍卅　美與碩李節文在穗執行槍決</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕前軍政部廣州區中將特派員莫與碩，及粵全省護沙總隊少將總隊長李節文，共同侵佔大批軍用槍械，匿藏中山一帶，及莫於去年十月間串同所屬，將保管之車胎二百餘個，調換商品圖利，經國防部派員來穗，組織高等軍事法庭審訊屬實，判處死刑，並呈奉蔣主席核准，穗行轅軍法處於今十六日下午六時，將該兩犯執行槍決。該犯等臨刑前穿黃斜紋衣褲，能度鎭定，並均書有遺囑。</p>

<h3>聯合國成敗的關頭</h3>
<p>聯合國第二屆大會昨已在成功湖胖開幕了。在此世界問題叢生念待解決之際，聯合國火會的開幕，無疑的，又帶給世人無限的新希望，所以世界各國對於這次聯合國大會，無不表示十二分的重視。我國外交當局爲重視這次聯合國大會起見，爰乃由王外長世杰親自前往參加，不僅希望這次聯合國大會能把國際上的陰霾一掃而空，透射出和平整榮的陽光來；而且盼望遠東的僵局也能因此而獲得轉圓的餘地。誠如王外長在紐約談稱：「此次大會實爲最重要之一次，將決定聯合國的興　，吾人必須使其興起。以言世界和平之前途，歐亞兩洲必須迅速獲得和平，否則局勢將惡化至各大國無法控制之程度。聯合國大會所當討論之問題，均係與維持世界和平問題有重要關係之問題。」今日之世界，已到了分合的關頭，這次聯合國大會的成敗，　爲世界的安危與人類的命運所繫。美國外交當局也特別重視這次大會；不僅將傾全力爲聯合國的後盾，而且馬歇爾國務卿也將竭智盡能，爭取聯合國的成功，務使其成爲眞正能維持世界和平促進人類福利的國際機構。</p>
<p>昨今兩日，爲聯合國大會的開幕時期，所聽到看到的演說，不是歌頌聯合國機構的和平工作，就是宣示其對於未來和平安全的願望，固足以增強世人對於聯合國機構所抱的信念與希望，但是在此際就判斷這次大會的成敗，未免言之太早了。在聯合國大會之外的大環境，姑置勿論，僅就這次大會所當討論的問題而言，即足以說明這次大會的艱難，實非一般人想像所及。據合衆社的報道，這次大會所遭遇的難題，最感棘手的，有下列幾項：（一）否決權的存發問題，並牽涉到聯合國憲章的修改問題；（二）朝鮮價局的打開；（三）巴爾幹問題的解決；（四）巴勒斯坦的分裂爲阿刺伯與猶太兩國問題，（五）普　安全問題，牽涉及原子能的管制問題與國際警備軍問題；（六）印度尼西亞問題；（七）世界各國的栽减軍備問題；（八）西班牙弗朗哥政權的處置問題；（九）印度與南菲所發生的人種區別問題；（十）其他重要的國際間題。</p>
<p>以上所述的各項問題，均含有複雜微妙的國際因素在內，與維持世界和平，都有非常密切的關係，如果這次聯合國大會不能因勢利導，善用時機，設法使這些國際問題獲得合理的解決，那末均有隨時爆發成爲國際亂源的可能。對於世界和平負有特別責任的若干國家，尤應認淸這些問題的嚴重性，決不可等閑視之，任其延宕下去，埋伏在國際的暗流裏，將來終必成爲國際上的亂源，誠如合衆社十二日紐約電稱：「不僅在這次大會的議程中，充滿了富於爆炸性的問題；而且美國已凖備與蘇聯「攤牌」，決一雌雄，馬歇爾國務卿將親自處理反共行動，美國之　與蘇聯之熊，即將展開其冷酷的戰爭了。』</p>
<p>合衆社的報道，固然不免危言聳聽，言過其實。但是也有其相當的理由；美國朝野雖然一致以擁護聯合國爲言，並相信聯合國若不能獲得美蘇兩國的熱心支持，那是永遠不會成功的；但是聯合國在戰時成立使美國朝野所發生的遠景，到現在可以說是完全幻滅了，這實在是人類的一大悲劇，記得在舊金山會議時，所有聯合國尙在疆塲上駢肩作戰，所以在會塲上更能互忍互讓，使大會充滿了融洽與友好的空氣，很順利　就通過了一部聯合國憲章，作爲戰後編造世界和平的張本；殊不料至大戰勝利結束之後，聯合國機稱雖一再在倫敦紐約舉行各種會議，但因聯合國內部意見的紛歧，迄今未能發生聯合國構　的功效。據我們的統計，蘇聯在安全理事會中行使否決權，前後已達十八次之多，怎能使聯合國機構成爲有效的國際機構。所以否決權的存廢問題，不僅牽涉及聯合國憲章的修改問題；而且對於聯合國機構的眞正功效，也有莫大的關係。</p>
<p>從這裏也可以看出聯合國機構陷於半身不遂狀態的病因，乃在美蘇兩國有如水火之不相容。在大戰期間，因爲勝利第一，大家都能容忍讓，精誠合作，駢肩作戰；但至勝利之後，好比時過景遷，一變而爲則利害第一，凡是有關本身利害的地，雙方感情，愈爭愈劣，以致造成積不相容的局面。聯合國機構處於美蘇衝突的夾縫中，自難運用其機構。因爲美國雖處於領導地位，容易取得世界各國的同情，在聯合國各種會議中，常佔上風；但是蘇聯　有否決權，也足與美鬨相對抗，因此造成相持不下的局面。所以我們認爲，只要美蘇兩國咸能以和平爲重，其良知不爲自私自利的慾望所蒙蔽，大家推誠相見，不僅美蘇間的愁雲慘霧立即可以消滅於無形，而且國際上立即可以透射出和平的陽光來。聯合國大會所遭遇的問題，更不難　刃而解。</p>
<p>要之，我們放限看看今日的世界，再低頭想想聯合國所面臨的難題，世界的前途是不容過分樂觀的；我們但願美蘇兩國的政治外交家，都能運用其政治智　，爭取聯合國的成功；美國外交當局已向着這方向努力邁進了，但不知蘇聯是否也將採取同樣的步驟？美蘇步驟的一致，就是聯合國的成功。所以聯合國的成敗，世界的分合，都已到了最後關頭，並將視美蘇兩國代表在這次聯合國大會中所採取的態度及其所作的努力而定了。</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國安全理事會經熱烈之辯論後，業於昨夜決定移除安理會議程上之希臘間題，使聯合國全體大會得以討論此一問題。辯論開始時，討論美國所根請安理會請求聯大解決希臘目前困難之決議案，澳洲支持美國之建議，然蘇代表則認此舉將使希臘問題更趨困難。法代表巴洛迪認爲安理會關於希臘問題之討論，旣已陷入價局，美國之建議或能爲突破價局之一種方法。葛羅米柯至此乃使用否決權，否決美國之建議。美代表復建議此一決議案，視爲程序問題而處置，又遭蘇聯否決。美代表不得已乃另行提出新的程序決議案，要求將希臘問題自議程上剔除。旣爲程序問題決議案，依法不受否決權之束縛，表決之下，贊成者九票，反對者蘇聯波蘭兩票，以不適用否決權故，該案遂被通過成立。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十五日電〕蘇聯今夜在聯會國安理會兩次行使否決權，制止美國以巴爾幹問題提出聯合國大會討論，但大會討論此案之門戶，已因美國另一動議而開啓，此一動議已不顧蘇聯之反對而被通過。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表葛羅米柯稱，美國之新提案，其動機與以前被否決者相同，即謀連累若千無辜政府，爲希臘政府表白。美國外交政策之非常粗魯，由此可見。巴爾幹問題早由美國提議列入聯大會議程，但依照聯合國憲章，聯大之討論應有限制，除非安理會要求貢獻意見或即自其議程中撤銷之案件。美國令日提議由安理會要求大會設法解決巴爾幹問題，以九興對二票表決通過，蘇聯與波蘭投反對粟。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯以本月份安理會輪値主席資格，裁定此乃實質問題，因而得行使否決權。美國代表詹森辯稱，此乃手續問題，以八對二票表泱通過，叙利亞棄權，蘇聯與波蘭投反對票。</p>

<h3>海防路　大血案　兇手黎明越窗入室舉斧猛砍夫死婦傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西海防路三九一弄三五八號平房內沈榮記　　　紗作主沈有仁，四十二歲，紹興人，十年前髮妻何氏病歿，遺有子女名一，長子　很，十五歲，女慶英，十四歲，因中饋乏人，經人介紹續娶甬籍寡婦張仕香（四十四歲）爲　室，九載以來，　情尙佳·會產二子一女，惟二子均已夭折，僅一女榮妹，年纔四齡，一家五口，　　如也。沈與其妻張氏及小女　妹同宿前樓擱樓上，不　　晨黎明五時許，突有暴徒將窗口裁梗四段拔去，爬　進內，用</p>
<p>電筒照射</p>
<p>沈之面部後，以利斧猛砍沈之頸部，深約寸許，沈急負痛　起，見一人越窗而逸，乃奮勇跳下追捕，不愼墜地，致後腦跌成一洞，氣息奄奄。斯時另有一暴徒尙留室中，張氏在睡夢中聞聲驚醒，起床急將其手拉住，因其時電燈熄滅，無法識認面目，孰知即係兇手，遂被將氏前胸右胸及乳房等處亂砍六七斧，血如泉湧，氏</p>
<p>負痛釋手</p>
<p>兇犯隨即　去。氏負創後，急奔下樓，卒因痛極，昏倒於樓下西墳弄口，其時沈姪永林及隣居　錫田等，聞聲出外探視，　見張氏潭身浴血，沈有仁氣息僅屬，急召救護車到塲，飛送傷人至新閘路平民醫院，沈因傷勢過重，</p>
<p>未幾身死</p>
<p>一面由　錫田股報江寗警分局，即由分局長王心恒，親率股長陳開洲，警長王琦等趕往出事地點，調查慘案經過。總局刑事偵緝科得報後，亦飭股員陳先榮馳往，並攝取兇手足印，俾便偵查。據目擊者稱，當時會目睹黑衣服者二人飛逸而去，故能確定兇犯實係二人云云。至張氏再醮，前夫遠在十年前故世，是否含有桃色性質，一時無從探測，惟據承辦警員語記者云，張氏年逾四旬，且一目已眇，故似以仇殺之成份爲多，該分局對此正在密查中。</p>
<h3>湯糰小吳一頁罪狀　活躍紅粉隊中慣施拆白手段</h3>
<p>海上拆自黨拐騙女人金飾之事，層出不窮，有一綽號湯　小吳之吳寳翔者，年卅歲，杭州人，（又名吳伯翔），因專事詐欺，爲警局捕獲，於本月十日移送地檢處法辦。現悉地檢處因該犯對所犯罪行在警局供認不諱，故似訊步驟已吿完舉，昨日由陳壽陶檢察官提起公訴。茲經記者探得其實情如下：吳寳翔，無業，專設騙局謀生，曾在國立復且大學肄業，民廿六年離校，至郵政儲金匯業局任二等郵務員，戰後調香港，三十年返滬，進交易所任職，以後即作此不法行爲。自去年六月起至今年四月止，曾先後以鄙劣手段，騙得財物甚夥，總計竟達七起。第一次在去年六月間，吳在四川路夜總會因跳舞認得舞女潘莉萍見潘手上有扁形金鐲，乃起歹意，翌日即設法約該舞女於逸園夜總會，於跳舞散塲時，</p>
<p>以欣賞為由</p>
<p>而騙得，於人叢中逸去，翌日即至閘北寶山路新天華銀樓兌得三十二萬元零六千元化用，並有該樓發票爲證。第二次爲去年八月十七日上午十時，吳冒相識之友人毛鴻法名，通電話至靜安別墅九六號，爲稱收西服料三段，待騙得後，一段出售於台灣友人王九，另二段自製西裝。第三次於去年九月十三日，於霞飛路偉達舞廳邂逅前識之李某舞女，李因急於歸返靑島，而苦於無川資，乃托吳將其金鐲兌現，吳僞裝誠實，先付李十萬元，其後，吳將兌得之卅二萬元吞沒自用。第四次爲去年十月四日上午九時，吳又</p>
<p>玩出新花樣</p>
<p>手提紅網綫袋一只，內露出嶄新一千元鈔於外，組看似爲鉅額現鈔，實則除浮面爲千元鈔，內則全爲草紙，即至南京西路九八八號雲霞時裝公司買衣料，將預先看定之黃狼皮大衣及呢大衣囑送南京西路五九二弄悅來公寓三一三號房間，吳屆時果往等候，先將假鈔放於台上，俟時裝公司店夥來後，即詐稱須將大衣予對面女友房間穿樣子，而遺鈔於桌上，店夥不疑有他，即被騙去，當日吳在浦東東昌路當去化用。第五次爲去年十一月上午九時，吳在陝西北路四七十弄十二號太平洋飯店卅八號房間，誆約因在</p>
<p>王吉照相館</p>
<p>搭訕而認識之李慧芳遊玩後即以欣賞爲詞，將李之首飾三兩八錢，及三克拉鑽戒二只騙去，至小東門老天寳銀樓兌得八十九萬七千元，三克拉鑽戒二只售與其友王傑，均被用盡。第六次爲本年二月廿日，吳至南京路小都會舞　將舞女倪堯妹帶往大滬舞廳遊玩，散塲時，藉口將倪之金鐲套在己手玩弄，　去後，即在中央銀行兌得六十萬元化用。第七次即在本年四月下旬，吳在大西洋咖啡館與衆友人跳舞，因而認得妓女三媛，再由三媛之介紹而認得另一妓女名妹妹者，（又名鄔鳳金）吳因見妹妹金飾頗多，頓萌惡念，其後即約鄔吃咖啡跳舞看電影，再邀至虹口上海旅館二〇七號房間，以催妹妹洗浴爲由，偸得金飾，兌得五百餘萬元，當夜至杭州耗盡。以上七次詐欺事實，俱經證明，且均爲被害人詳細確證爲湯　小吳所爲，其以詐欺爲常業之行徑，實屬法無可恕。</p>

<h3>臨邛訪古寶</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十三日訊〕川西邛味上月洪水成災，縣境西河汎濫，沿河堤堰多被冲毀。廿八日大水冲塌城西班竹林河岸，次日在河岸冲圯處，發現唐代遺物，包括石刻，雖塑，鑄像等古物多種。另有元代石刻造像多件，刊刻精美，雕塑壯麗，極當歷史價値。現已引起西南考古與歷史學者研究興趣，記者昨特驅車赴古物發現地點，作一度參觀。</p>
<p>邛　東距成都百八十里，古稱臨邛，淸改邛州入民國改今名，爲歷史上有名的大文學家司馬相如與卓文君情奔故里。十一日晨記者搭車由蓉出發沿途秋禾早熟，穗麥茁壯，枝枝　垂，宛似葡萄，農人正忙於打谷，晒谷。沿河附近，猶見敗瓦頹垣，沙磧石田，不少華樓大厦，早已棟折摧崩，處處有災後難民，鳩形鵠面　搭棚　止，水災跡象，宛然可見。午正抵邛，城內舖戶櫛比，頗爲繁華，此閒不乏風流隹話的遺蹟，如司塲相如讀書處，琴挑處，車文君當爐變酒處等，入城後，稍事瀏覽，即赴民敎館參觀古物。</p>
<p>在該館聞負責人談：此批古物係上月廿八日洪水冲圯西河（邛水），傍城南河堤被冲毀十餘丈，次日水遽退，遂被發現。但爲地方土豪取去不少，政府僅保存部份。彼引導記者參觀，第一部份爲石刻，佛像，金剛護，法，觀音等造像，刻有開成（唐文宗年號）二年，咸通（唐武宗年號）等字。鐵劃銀鈎，縷刻精美，線條流利，形體結構，活潑莊嚴，望之栩栩如生，表現頗似西洋寫實派（Deallsm）作風，足以媲美敦煌石室的唐代壁畫。第二部份爲銅鑄及石質雕塑的大小佛像，大者高七八尺，小者僅五六寸，輪廟線條，美麗活潑，頭部之瓔珞，毛髮，眉目，均極生動。有銅鑄觀音一尊，貌類羌人，高幾一丈。充分表現佛敎之莊嚴偉大，上刋會昌（唐　宗年號）三年造。第三部份爲各種經幢與浮屠，經幢大小形式均不一，設計美觀，離刻精緻，小者僅盈尺，稜角作八方形，每面僅二寸，倣佛成都有名的辛亥保路紀念碑。上刻佛頂眞勝陀羅尼眞言，記咸通八年造，筆畫之細，僅如毛髮，雖經剝蝕，仍極淸晰。浮屠式樣巧小玲瓏，狀類西安雁搭，兩者均疑出自名手精心之作。此外尙有部份元代雲點石刻造像，大者盈尺，小者約四五寸，刊至正十五年造，製作亦殊精美。</p>
<p>記者瀏覽之後，帶了欣慰景仰心情，在夜色蒼茫中遄返成都，同時深深感覺到，中國是文明古國，但中國文物寳藏，反多落爲外人搜羅研究。有唐一代爲中華民族盛世，而典章文物，流傳殊尠。復查此次發現文物，均係唐文，武，懿三宗時代製造，武宗是佛敎第一大對頭，會昌五年（公元八四五年）詔毀天下佛寺，勒令僧尼歸俗，佛敎徒調之「三武之禍」。何以懿宗時又有番僧與廟宇及如此輝煌佛物？這是歷史及考古學者値得研究的問題。記者深盼這千古寳藏的發現，在沉寂已久的中國學術界，引起熱烈研究興趣，這在動亂不寗的今日，未始不是一件文物盛事。（記者周學端）</p>
<h3>台省阿里山林塲擬開發楠梓仙溪</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十六日電〕素稱台省森林寳庫之阿里山，近年來因大量砍伐，林木藏量乃吿銳减，據統計目前僅餘林木四十七萬餘石，若就現有集材設備計算，約再逾三年即可全部砍運完畢，而結束過去該林區之偉大業務，阿里山林塲有　及此，頃已計劃就高雄縣矚之楠粹仙溪處女地帶予以開發。據初步調查，楠梓仙溪林區，總面積廣達一八四四公頃，林木蓄積一四三五點一三四石，三九八點九六七點二七二立方公尺，年砍材以十四萬石計，將可繼續伐遝十年之久，詳細計劃，業經有關方面擬就，以建築阿里山森林鐵路之沿長綫爲主，需新建鐵降十公里，即可進入該林區之深部，而可全部伐運。工程方面，決分兩期進行，預定三年內完竣，阿里山林塲近決組織調查隊，出發楠梓仙溪作詳實之勘察。</p>
<h3>浙贛路需車孔殷局方謀改善業務</h3>
<p>〔本報金華十二日訊〕浙贛路杭饒段通軍以來，車輛不敷甚多，該段所急需之客車六十九輛，貨車三百六十九輛，經一再電呈交通部迅賜籌撥，奈除一部分貨車由靑島運來外，客車迄未撥到，應付旅客萬分困難，局方頃復向京滬津浦兩路暫時借用十輛，如能照撥，則此段客運，當更能改善。又：該局對目下杭饒交通情形極爲重視，局長侯家原氏特手諭工務處處長慶承道，運輸處處長杜湘，機務處副處長周元谷聯袂由杭來金，轉赴衢饒綫各站視察業務，藉謀改進。</p>

<p>〔上〕坐鎭淄博之胡景瑗將軍〔下〕博山名勝：因園淸音閣（本報特派員麗天寄）</p>
<h3>淄博礦區踏勘　恐佈統治　新式樣層出不窮</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南七日航訊〕記者到淄博，是在國軍入駐淄博後的第十二天，但到處都還看到共匪所遺留下來的標語傳單及匪政府的吿示，尤其是博山，共匪在大柳坑山東省模範窰業廠的隔壁還設立了一所僞「山東省立魯中公學」，城內范公祠設立過僞黨政幹部訓練班，城南山頭莊嘗一度成爲僞魯省府的辦公處，因此，這也許博山是魯共政治經濟文化的中心的綠故，所以就我目擊所及，幾乎一半以上房屋牆壁上共匪的標語仍完好如初。最初我對此有些莫名其妙，從正面側面間了許多老百姓，才知道共匪臨撤退前嘗吿訴他們：兩個月以後仍舊要回來作「第四次解放」，所有標語一律否則格殺不論，匪在撤退前，並張貼出許多巨幅佈吿，這種佈吿在淄博一帶記者嘗目擊過很多，其中最觸目驚心的是下面一張：　魯中行署緊急佈吿（戰字第一號）</p>
<p>第一項：地主，還鄕團，地痞流氓，暗特務，凡具有以下事實之一者，處死刑。</p>
<p>（一）向蔣軍蔣特報吿村幹部，使遭生命財產違害者。</p>
<p>（二）直接暗殺村幹及翻身農民者</p>
<p>（三）向蔣軍蔣特報吿公糧，軍事，資財或公家財產遭損失者。</p>
<p>（四）向蔣軍蔣特報吿或直接竊取民兵武器彈藥者。</p>
<p>（五）威迫農民，倒出鬥爭果實者。</p>
<p>（六）向蔣軍蔣特報吿軍工到屬姓名，致遭違書者。</p>
<p>（七）帶領蔣軍蔣特强姦民女者。</p>
<p>（八）領導歡迎蔣軍，蔣軍辦公向人民征糧，征款，征丁者。</p>
<p>（九）塗抹破壞解放軍民主政府羣衆團體之標語傳單或宣傳資料者</p>
<p>第二項：地主，還鄕團，地痞流氓，暗特務，凡其以下事實，即行寬大處理。</p>
<p>（十）凡痛改前非，不再事蔣，向民主政府悔過自新者。</p>
<p>此佈。</p>
<p>主　任馬馥塘</p>
<p>副主任程照軒</p>
<p>一九四七年七月　日</p>
<p>小到連歡迎國軍，塗抺標語，都要被</p>
<p>判處極刑</p>
<p>共匪完全藉恐怖政策來維持他的殘酷統治，從這裏便可想見一斑。不僅如此，據若干飽受共匪蹂躝的老百姓吿訴我，由於子彈在共匪過於名貴，輕易不使用，所以對於處決死刑，向來不採槍決辦法，當然，這在另一方面也正是爲了要加强恐怖，使人民知所　服，因此，他的刑法是多到書不勝書，除掉前節所述「石頭燉肉」等外，茲就老百姓所吿，並記憶所及，再爲介紹數種如下：</p>
<p>（一）坦克隊—以巨型石滾兩個，用木框架好，拖以牛馬，使被處分者立於兩滾之間，行於崎嶇路上，直至腿斷脚碎爲止。</p>
<p>（二）百尺竿頭望「蔣」軍—對領導歡迎國軍的處分辦法是用一長本桿，將被處分者綁縛桿之頂端；將桿豎起後割斷其繩，摔的腦漿朋裂而死，這呌做百尺竿頭望「蔣」軍。</p>
<p>（三）烤豬—將被處分者</p>
<p>悶置甕中</p>
<p>周圍燃柴，稱曰烤豬。</p>
<p>（四）反省湯—用屎尿灌被處分者頭面，直至其「直認不諱」共匪所加的罪名爲止，稱曰「反省湯」。</p>
<p>（五）拉電綫—將被處分者令跪於六七層或八九層高桌上，事先有人以繩繫桌腿，乘其不備，猛力拉繩，桌倒人亦爲之摔斃，名曰「拉電綫」。</p>
<p>（六）點天燈—將頭頂潑油點火，稱爲「點天燈」。</p>
<p>（七）倒栽葱—挖六尺許深坑，使頭朝下脚朝上活埋之名曰倒栽葱</p>
<p>（八）人造噴泉—將被處分者之下身埋於土中，血液自然被壓上　，在痛苦喊呌之際，用鐵釘釘入其頭部，猛然拔出，熱血噴溢，稱爲「人造噴泉」。</p>
<p>（九）金木水火土風—將人拘入黑屋中以針刺腹部曰金，用棍棒猛打曰木，將人倒掛於鼻腔中灌辣椒水曰水，將人置甕中四週用火烤曰火，活埋曰土，將人赤條條倒懸百尺高桿曰風。</p>
<p>共匪就是用這一類慘極人寶的</p>
<p>嚴刑峻法</p>
<p>來統治他的「解放區」的。但嚴刑峻法終不能全部壓制住人民一顆向　的心。在許多地方，國軍還沒有到，人民仍多有不顧一切暗中前往歡迎，國軍剛到，每家門口都已自動掛上靑天白日滿地紅的國旗，他們在共匪侵佔時期對保藏這面國旗比保護他們的生命還要緊，國軍需要征夫征糧，他們多能自動捐輸，踴躍輸將。由於過去淄博一帶三退三進的敎訓，他們對國軍的唯一希望僅是今後不要再撤退，否則他們勢將受到共匪更深的蹂躪和報復，在前數日一個謠傳出去說國軍又將撤退，哀哀小民，無所適從，最後被迫大家不約而同守在城門口，準備隨國軍同時撤退，在他們的意思城門口國軍有崗哨，假使國軍眞的撤退，他們可以與</p>
<p>哨崗同走</p>
<p>後來人數愈集愈多，經國軍高級軍官說明是「換防」，不是「撤退」，老百姓始相繼散去，這足證在共匪恐怖統治下人民的心都還是傾向政府的，問題只在政府應如何收　這般慘遭共匪蹂躪的人心，這絕不僅止於消極的救濟撫慰，就可濟事，尤其重要的是如何積極訓練之，領導之，「以組織對組織」，「以武力對武力」，俾能武裝還鄉，各安生業，而勿使人民感覺着再受有任何生存的威脅。（特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>上海猶太學校　實施新敎育計劃　注重手的訓練</h3>
<p>上海猶太學校，將於本年秋間實施一種新敎育計劃，此項計劃在國外已獲得驚人成功，今番流入上海，尙屬初次。過去，凡批評今日之敎育制度者，每謂吾人之學校過於依賴書本，而不能以實用知識灌輸兒童，使其有充分之凖備足以應付生活之艱苦。</p>

<h3>對外貿易會議第二日　舉行演講審查提案　張嘉璈講外滙政策與貿易新使命今日繼續開大會並定於下午閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國對外貿易會議，昨晨十時在市商會續開，出席代表一百餘人，由黃再壽任主席。原定程序由央行總裁張嘉璈演說，題爲「我國新外匯政策與進出口貿易界之新使命」，因張氏因公赴粵，由限額分配處長李　代表宣讀，要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）戰前我國入超之彌補，不外僑匯外商投資及白銀出口三途，但八年抗戰，傷及國家之經濟元氣，而匪亂頻仍，無暇恢復，遂致造成今日之困難局面。</p>
<p>（二）八月十六日頒佈之管理外匯新辦決，爲比較合理之措施，此項新政策實施之後，進口貨品之法幣價格，不致過份跌落，而無過份利得入於進口商之手，國內同類產品不致感受威脅，出口貨價可與國內其他物價漸趨平衡。用以鼓勵出口，促進生產。</p>
<p>（三）相信新外匯政策實施之後，外匯市塲可望穩定。</p>
<p>（四）管制進口貿易，並非政府政策傾向管制，實出於不得已，否則外匯之支出將無法估計，囤積亦將無法阻止。</p>
<p>（五）進口商登記之資格審查，以民國三十五年營業額爲標準，並將登記審查標準稍予擴充。此外有國外著名廠商獨家經營之資格者，亦准予登記。而工廠於戰前戰後自行直接輸入原料專供自用者，雖數量不多，亦可取得登記資格。</p>
<p>（六）進口物資之最後利益，就國家立塲，應歸於消費者，無論工廠或進口商，均屬於轉手人地位，當以合法利潤爲滿足。</p>
<p>（七）希望國產品减輕成本改良品質，經營者發揮違大目光及合作精神，以利輸出。</p>
<p>聲明立塲情緒激昂</p>
<p>李榦宣讀畢，匆匆辭出，原定程序爲趙棣華演講「經濟建設與國際金融機構」，因趙氏在京，亦由大會秘書代爲宣讀。內對國際借貸之基本認識及國際銀行之結構與運用，頗多發揮。</p>
<p>此時會塲空氣，頗感沉悶，上午會議中之高潮，爲立院要求解散及改組全國商聯會之討論，一時情緒激昂，言辭鋒利。結果決定今晚假金谷飯店，召開各省市商會代表聯席會議，一致聲明對此事之立塲。</p>
<p>中午全國輪船業公會假招商局歡宴全體代表，杜月笙氏致辭，主張維護本國航業與發展對外貿易，認爲輪船業爲「補助商業」，對國民經濟之繁榮，有不可分離之關係：而無形出口貿易之收入，又可補償國際收支之差額。</p>
<p>楊管北徐學禹相繼演說，均認爲出口業與航業休戚相關，英國爲保護其航運業，費盡心機，民法間。政府密切配合，値得我國效</p>
<p>分組會議審查提案</p>
<p>午後二時起舉行分組會議，分輸出輸入外匯運輸保險及特種組共五組審查案提，共計九十餘件，討論甚爲熱烈。尤以輸出輸入兩組爲然，直至六時左右均告結束，各項提案經修正歸納後，將於今日提交大會通過。</p>
<p>晚七時銀行公會銀錢業公會保險業公會信託業公會招待全體代表，徐國懋致辭，謂目前商業銀行存款僅有一萬億元左右，且多數爲短期存款，折合戰前幣値，不足二千五百萬元，實不足應付正當工商業之需要。希望國家今後之金融政策，能與增加生產之努力相配合。</p>
<p>沈日新代表錢業公會致辭，謂風聞政策將自美國輸入烟草原料，可供國內三年之用，此訊如非虛傳，則與國內農業生產有妨害，希望與會代表能加以注意。</p>
<p>嗣由寗夏代表喬森榮致答辭，除對招待表感謝外，請出席者注意西北羊毛貨棄於地之病象，並希望本市工業界能投資西北，設廠製造。至八時許始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>今日大會外賓演講</p>
<p>今晨九時續開全體大會，特請英商公會主席凱約翰演講「中國現階段之進出口貿易問題」，中央銀行顧間楊格博士演講「中國轍出貿易之擴展」，張肖梅女士演講「我國之國際收支平衡問題」；午後討論各組審查報吿，並通過大會宣言，大會定今日閉幕。</p>
<h3>英匯掛低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯市價，昨日英匯有變動。外匯平衡基金委會之英匯基準價，掛低爲十二萬元，較前跌二千元。港匯减爲七千五百元，　比减爲九千元。美匯基準價未動，仍爲四萬〇五百元。至指定銀行之買賣價，請參閱下列商情欄。</p>
<h3>市上銀根仍緊　華股頹勢難挽</h3>
<p>華股昨以塲外交貨者過於擁擠，發生困難，息價被迫提高至二角一及二角五分半，中途極爲不利。但前日紡建發薪時，因大票不敷而改用之中行信託部百萬元支票，竟被附會爲巨額本票，人心尙有浮動，低後尙有起色。終以銀根仍緊，午後交易仍感毫無彈性。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>以英匯掛縮二千元，及平行綫本票之謎而見高，但此種心理開後即吿打消。永紗開後，在六五號等脫手中，步低至二三七元及二四〇元。一一七號一三四號尙進，曾將遞永紗拉上至二四四元，入後即因塲外有無法交貨，息價大增之影響，一〇四號等力拋永紗，二二三號等紛售遞永紗，而步降至二三三元及二三七元低價。經二一八號等補進之下，得被支持。一五七號並進現永紗，一部份惑於本票流言者，有所抵補。近午永紗曾回漲到二三八元及二四三元之價，而後以二三七元及二四二元之價收市。收後喊價稍低，結果較前收即交股計永公中法跌半成，永紗新光景福勤興微挫，新華信和景綸尙平，美亞麗安內衣微升，閘北榮豐中絲火柴新亞微挫。遞交股計華豐永紗平平，新光信和美亞景福微降。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>上塲時稍見穩定，遞永紗開後，自二四四元起，由二三號等陸續了結，散戶及檯面撳抑甚力，而步降至二三四元及二三六元低價。九七號等尙納，升至二三九元。無如國行交換差進後，銀根仍緊，三二號仍有了結。永業由一九一號掛低至跌停板，會再退至二三六元，七六號一一六號維持之下，永紗遂以二三六元及二三八元收市。收後喊價見疲，結果較千收計永紗信和美亞景福勤興新華閘北中絲景綸麗安徽挫，永公中法小升，永業跌停，新亞新光華豐　豐尙平。遞交股計永紗信和炎亞新光景福微挫，華豐尙平，塲外各老股大生及文化股續降，餘尙平定，</p>
<h3>國行差入　銀根緊俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差入三〇九億元，週一亦差入五一二億元，故銀根又見繫信，暗息喊高至一角九分，華股塲外多方貼息亦抬高至二角五分半。昨日中央差入三一一億元，直接交換行莊差入一三〇億元，外商銀行差入一五二億元，代理交換行莊差出五九一億元。</p>
<h3>國行辦理活期存欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲便利商業行莊運用資金起見，特於辦理同業活期存款之外，舉辦同業定期存款，以資調節。該項存款，規定以五億元爲一單位，以十日爲期，利息五分，較活期存款爲高。又如存款行莊·在期內需用頭寸時，仍可照存　加二分，向國行抵押。故商業行莊，咸感便利。聞自八月二十日起，前往國行辦理該項存款者，極爲踴躍，總數計達一千餘億元，對吸收市塲游資，穩定物價，不無補益。此外，幷聞除商業行莊外，國家行局如未向國行辦理轉抵押或折款者，亦可獲得同業定期存款之便利云。</p>
<h3>貼放委會核准　工貸四十億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會第廿三次例會，於九月十六日下午四時，在該會會議室舉行，出席委員秦潤卿等多人，由秦潤鄕主席，當通過第廿三次工業審查會審查之工業貸款案件十四件，金額四十億〇四千萬元。</p>
<h3>抑平紗布市價　採獎勵密報辦法　南運紗布限額增加五成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會第十一次委員會例會，於昨日下午四時起舉行。決議：（一）最近紗布市價，漲風頗熾，深恐爲一般奸商國積操縱居奇，爲加强管制計，決定採取獎勵密報辦法。如業外人經營紗布，及業內人確有囤積居奇之情形者，概照當時議價，予以收回。對於密報者，即予獎勵。該項辦法，準備於下次市府經濟會報中，提出商討後，即交由該會紗布組付諸實施。</p>
<p>（二）爲澈底平抑棉花漲風，決定調查本市各花號及紗廠等最近存花數量，俾便利管制。</p>
<p>（三）南運紗布數量，自本月份起，照原數增加五成。北運紗布，俟該會天津辦事處成立後，擬予澈銷管制。</p>
<p>（四）棉紗議價，決定依照原議，採取機動性辦法，藉以平抑市價</p>
<h3>紗布下游</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因供應籌碼充裕，市上銀根依然緊迫，行情擴吿下游。棉布塲內轉賣甚夥，廠家拋售者衆，市勢供過於求，亦吿不支。</p>
<h3>票據當日抵用</h3>
<p>銀行業請暫維現有習慣</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會，常務理事會議昨決議：（一）票據當日抵用事，決再呈財部，請仍暫維現有習慣。（二）爲財部開征特種營業稅百分之四事，擬呈請核减。（三）同業遭停止交換後，所發生之退票責任問題，應請確定，議決再付審愼研究。</p>
<h3>統債疲挫外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨更見痰怯，散戶之吸納，難遏賣風，五〇三室五五五室均售，成交仍僅三百餘萬。統丙自一二三〇〇元開後，步降至一〇五〇〇元而後略定。結果較前收計甲乙跌九百元，統丙獨降一千二，丁挫八百元，統戊微跌五百元。</p>
<p>外股昨無甚轉變，證券帮求供互見，各股亦升沉不一，港申電報長至十二元三，亦鮮大進步。結果較前收計會德豐業廣祥泰微挫，英聯怡睥航業業廣小升，除尙平定。</p>
<h3>旅韓僑商籲請開放對韓貿易</h3>
<p>中韓貿易協會理事長周愼九等日前聯名電呈僑務委員會劉委員長及海外部戴代部長，籲請廢除對韓貿易之禁令，早日恢復正常關係，幷提出臨時通商辦法建議二點。</p>
<h3>人造絲騰揚</h3>
<p>人造絲去胃不衰，行情不斷上騰。昨市又比上日大起一百七十萬元，一二〇號雜牌有光，開盤喊三千二百萬元，最大做到四百萬元，最後價退做三百三十萬元。東洋下午飛大做四百五十萬元，結果做三百八十萬元，一五〇金三馬有光，昨價在三千六百萬元左右。</p>
<h3>食油恢復自由買賣　市塲交易平淡</h3>
<p>油市昨日重行恢復自由賣買，市塲交易平淡之極，趨勢下游。豆油挫跌一二萬元，簍生油平疲。桶生油挫落二三萬元，淸油平正，菜油軟化，蔴油亦低一二萬元。</p>
<p>油商會代表今日謁市長</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油商業公會於昨日下午四時，舉行全體理監聯席會議，由張超主席。首先報吿奉市長面論，欲恢復食汕配售事宜，惟此事關係重大，經商討結果·決定於今日下午三時·由張超代表晋謁吳市長，希望解決下列數點：（一）恢復配售，用何名稱。（二）該機構經費來源。（三）配售所需之食油，由何機構供給。（四）人事支配等，予以決定後，方可積極從事辦理恢復配售事宜。</p>
<p>店胃見懈米市略疲</p>
<p>：昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬二千七百餘石，店方進胃見懈，實以價目大高，門售出手困難，散戶吐售尙衆，市况由堅而疲。粳秈元米均見回挫三五千至萬元不一，早薄秈貨稀尙定。麵粉配售不動，市塲動態亦頗平靜，價無軒輊。麩皮閩方暢納之下，飛黃騰達，狂漲六七千元，突破十萬大關。豆餅汕頭台灣有動，步升二三千元。黃豆客帮本街互吸，續漲三五千至萬元。</p>

<h3>上海是不易立足的社會　答復來滬謀生的學徒—效生君</h3>
<p>效生君：讀完你的長信，我們非常的感動，在目前的社會上不合理的事情委實太多，像你這樣處境的靑年，正有着很不小的數目，你的父親「重商輕學」貿然的決完了你的前途，的確是一件不合理的事情，你有强烈的求知慾，常然很好，你立志繼續求學，以達到你未來的目標，我們表示欽佩。</p>
<p>但是你應該在事前作一個縝密的考慮。作一個周祥的計劃，你不顧一切的來到上海，當然是一個靑年應有的勇氣，但這種魯莽的行爲，往往會犯上「有勇無謀」的錯誤，而使整個的計劃都遭受到挫敗。</p>
<p>上海學校雖多，但是學費都定得很高，沒有錢的窮苦靑年是無法進去的。「助學金」，「貸學金」之類，都是要有優良的成續報吿單或護明書才能申請。找尋工作在這人浮　　事的上海，也是一件很不容易的事情，必須耐心的等待，以獲取適當的機會。</p>
<p>上海生活程度很高，沒有固定的收入是很難生活下去的，依我們的意見，還是回到常熟家中去，向你的父親說明你的志願，假便他是一個眞正愛護子女的父親的話，一定會對你諒解的。祝好！·編者·（來函刊十五日本欄）</p>

<h3>轟炸及其他</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>聽見日本貨「質料不佳」，許多中國廠商或許心頭「放下一塊火石頭」，以爲日貨不足懼。其實日貨成本輕，在原有工業基礎下，她的出品，在美軍監督之下，她一定可以趕上戰前的水準</p>
<p>我們的出品呢？中國廠商得忖量忖量。</p>
<p>「舞女懷子見市長」—，這自然是極慘的事。但是在舞女大會上，只見舞女大哭，並且只說只有「死路一條」，實在令人氣短。</p>
<p>這次舞女大會，職工們話說得很多，而且提出許多辦法，舞女們自己爲什麼不多說幾句話？「飛盤」以後，又有「轟炸倫敦」的「奇聞」。其實，這時候，這些　人聽聞的戰爭「新陳」，還發得太早。老實說，目前誰也不會挑動戰爭，六七年的「毀滅」與「死亡」，人類的神經還沒有恢復正常呢，何况其他！</p>
<p>各大學錄取考生都陸續公布了，落第學生的去向，倒是値得使人懷念的。</p>
<p>不知敎育當局對他們有什麼調查統計沒有？</p>
<p>胡適對本報記者發表談話，主張加軍少數國立大學，我們完全贊同；但中國文盲太多，辦好大學果然有理，但肅淸文盲更應該普遍地展開，胡適博士，以爲如何？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>中國與暹羅</h3>
<p>— 正明譯</p>
<p>暹羅的主要問題，是本國人民頗意自治，而歐洲一個殖民强國却硬要指導「落後」人民的命運，仍圖保持它戰前地位之間的衝奕，而使暹羅成爲此種衝奕無限期繼續進行下去的一片大地，但在今天東南亞內，暹羅已是企圖脫掙外國殖民主義形式桎梏的唯一國家，這使那班熟悉　羅狀况的旅行者們，感到一種愉快的對照。</p>
<p>然而這個小王國，也有它自己的種種戰後問題。暹羅形式上雖已獨立，但仍受幾個列强某種程度的控制，譬如它的大部份國外貿易，現在就掌握在英國人手裏。據說它的煤破工業大概有百分之八十，均受英澳利益的控制，同時全國其他各種商業的主要部份，也揑在中國商人的手裘。　羅的邊界紛爭事件，從來沒有能够滿足暹羅的要求予以解決，現在已經導成同越南法人的緊張關係，當法國現在已將越南的全部要求土地恢復了的時候，法國人就指責暹羅人用武器供給維明政府，而且便利他們私自偷過越南邊境。</p>
<p>戰後的通貨膨脹，外匯準備金的减少，國外重要投資的缺乏，以及政府顯然不太有效率，已對國家造成了許多困難，但是暹羅最大的簡單問題，却是少數的中國僑民，將來也許有一天會變成多數民族的問題。</p>
<p>在日本投降之前，中國與　羅即已發生形式上的外交關係。暹羅在過去還不大願意有此種外交關係，因爲她怕一個中國大使，必將變成爲估計有三百萬至四百萬暹羅華僑的官方代表言，這三四百萬華僑人數，佔暹羅全國人口也許有五分之一，一向造成了一個尖銳的少數民族問題。在對日勝利以後，中國以戰勝的五强之一出現，暹羅除與中國建立外交關係別無他途，盤谷與南京互相交換大使，而暹羅政府則仰仗各種各式的法律，來限制中國在她本土內的種種活動。除一九四五年的某次暴動事件外，兩國關係至少在表面上頗爲平靜安謐</p>
<p>暹羅的華僑，由於工作辛勤而能力卓越，已在暹羅的經濟內佔居主宰地位。暹羅人一般地說來，都是農民而且是統治者，同時全部貿易和商業，實際上却都握在中國人手裏。因爲中國人越來越富庶，所以暹羅的農民和工人越發將自己所受的經濟壓迫和其他困難，諉罪於中國「中間人」。同時華僑則感到他們時常公開遭受攻聲，自然態益傾向祖國以求保護，而向暹羅要求更多的保證和特權。此稱局勢含有爆炸性，這是很顯明的事情。只有雙方謹愼而溫和的考慮應付一切問題，才能保證二國人民在和平中共同並肩生活下去。（譯自密勒氏評論報）</p>
<h3>明日的石油</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>悲觀的預言家時時在說，全世界特別是美國的石油快要吿聲了。最近的種種發展，却表明這種恐懼全是「杞憂」。第一，在目前的儲量用盡以前，原子能早已减低了石油的需要。第二，美國在坦克薩斯　堪　斯兩州建立的新工廠，不久就可用地下的「天然煤氣」每年製成幾百萬桶的汽汕，而且便宜得跟現在用石油來煉成的一樣。第三，級澤西州的「美孚公司」已跟世界上最大的石炭公司——「匹茨堡聯合煤礦公司」——訂定了合作的計劃，要大規模地從事研究實騐，以求得用煤來製造汽油的經濟合算的方法。第四，各國的第一流地質學家，已預吿可在南北美洲和歐·亞。菲諸州周圍（例如日本的九州島以北）的淺海中發見廣大無垠的油田。迄今，這些靠近陸地的油源，幾乎還沒有觸動過。在美國，只有加利福尼亞和路易齊亞那兩州在附近的漢海中鐵　過油井，其實海洋底上的油源，其儲　之大是不可與陸上的相提並論的；而現在科學和技術日有進展，距離大規模地正式開採它們的日期當不遠了。</p>
<h3>從上海到日本</h3>
<p>— 吳華慶</p>
<p>——美行紀實之一</p>
<p>八月廿四日的淸晨，招商第一碼頭聚集了不少汽車，箱籠，和男女老少各色人等，這些人和貨物，都要準備進入那隻靠在碼頭上的白色的戈登將軍輪。</p>
<p>輪船準於下午三時啓椗，碼頭上的送客人山人海，船一離岸，就像潮水樣湧到浮動甲板上來，揮動了手帕，草精，或洋傘，被擴音器裏的音樂所激發，差不多想跳下水來相送。有一個猶太團體送他們的友人，張着Bon　Voyage的大幟，揮着藍白相間的小旗，等大船開出，一部份人接着跳上小汽艇追過來，高唱其猶太啦啦歌，良久始返。船過閘北水電廠，廠內大放砲仗，歡送他們廠內出國的同事。</p>
<p>第一晚在甲板上放映電影。我因連日疲乏已極，不管艙裏熱不熱，倒頭就睡。</p>
<p>這次旅客之中，有二百五十多人是自費留學生，而且　照規定，都坐三等艙，所以自成部落。除了吃飯睡覺之外，他們也能享用甲板和休息室，所以也頗覺方便和舒適。廿五日晚上，留學生開了一次全體大會，常塲統計了一下各校的分配情形，結果，以到密歇根大學去的爲最多。大家議定，各校分成小組，在舊金山起岸後可以結伴同行。此外，又推定了負責人，籌備做戲，歌唱，演講，跳舞，橋戲，攝影等種種活動。這樣在這一次的旅行中，自然不會再感到寂寞的了。</p>
<p>廿六日淸晨，輪船開進日本淞河內海。海邊山嶺起伏，帆艇疏落。九時許駛進神戶海港，港口有半園形的長堤，每個堤口各分立兩個燈塔。進港以後，擴音器內即報吿禁止攝影，因爲日本遠在軍事管制狀態。神戶的海港工程，建築得頗具規模，成狼牙形伸出港面，使增加停泊船隻的長度。所有旅客一概不准上岸，不過遠遠看到高廈矗立，鐵囟冒着黑烟，不禁生出無限感慨。碼頭上全由美軍管制，鐵梯的搬運用起重吉普車來吊，即使糾正梯子的地位，也用小吉普來推移，極盡機械化的能事。日本人看在眼裏，也許不由得不服貼了吧。上午十一時又開船。</p>
<p>八月廿六日晚於戈登輪休息室內</p>
<p>啓：「春秋」今日暫停一天。</p>

<p>我們可以武斷地說美國沒有廢人，即使是老弱殘疾，也有特種工作可做，軍火工廠僱用很多瞎子在工作，他們牽着警犬從家裏到工廠，中國的瞎子，無工可做，祗好在馬路邊呌「娘娘太太」。我們從歐美學了半瓶酷的「人這主義」反對童工，而美國是實刮挺硬的人這主義國家，却沒有禁止童工的苛法，祗要僱主不虐待童工，而工作時間和性質不妨碍兒童的發育，爲什麼借着「人道主義」的幌子，斷絕了童工的生活，美國有許多適於兒童的工作，其中之一是送報，幾百萬兒童在每晨上學之前，騎着脚踏車挨車送報，每份報紙以五分計，報館得三分，報童得二分，一天派五十份便可得美金一元，論工作不過每晨半小時，而且由家　騎脚踏車到學校，順便派報，毫不費事，報紙是由報館用汽車送到報報童家裏的，到棉花及橘子收穫的時候，農登出大幅廣吿，招聘學童帮同採棉擷橘，供膳宿之外，每天可得工資美金七八元，政府鼓勵「兒童勞働服務」，至少可以騰出成人担任其他更重要的工作，如果沒有童工，勢必迫使一大部分成人從工廠移殖到家村，而影響到工廠的生產量。童工制可以養成兒童自食其力的獨立精神，美國父母向不給兒童零用錢，全憑兒童自力更生，年齡較大之兒童，有受傭於咖啡店担任招待及淸潔工作者，有被僱在家庭看護嬰孩者，均以不妨碍學業爲原則，擦皮鞋亦爲兒童職業之一種，此種輕易工作，試令成人爲之，未免浪費人力，美國人決不以慈善名義，利用兒童之勞力白做工作，故凡發動兒童推銷「癱瘓病郵票」，「援助中國運動紙花」，「防癆運動紙花」等均有物質酬勞，美國習慣，義務與權利，相輔而行，父親呌兒子把皮鞋加油擦亮，循例給Dime（一角）一只，兒子受之無愧，取而申謝。在中國家庭，則兒童並不担任家庭淸潔事宜，而向父母需索糖菓之費，視爲天經地義，優容放縱，豈所以敎育兒童之道，美國兒童在工作時期例以工作所得，提出百分之若干，交由父母執管，以抵補食宿費，實則父母爲之添置衣服日用品，此不特可養成兒童之責任性，亦所以節制其浪費也。中國兒童自小承父母餘　，不知物力艱難，因此敗家之子成爲東方特產，美國人不以遺產給子孫，遂無家可傾，無產可蕩矣。（五一）</p>

<h3>追究憶圓揚靈</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>「贛南蔣經國，浙西賀揚靈」，是東南抗戰政治上的彗星，想不到現在後一顆星竟殞落下去了！</p>
<p>兩個人政權能力，都受着高級當局竭力的支持，一個在後方替行政界開了一點新風氣，一則在前方苦維着抗戰後期最艱苦的局面。</p>
<p>同賀揚靈先生相識，還是在二十六年的冬天，那時就州初陷，僅隔一衣帶水的紹興民衆，已驚惶萬狀；雖是廢歷的年底，大家小戶，却都已紛紛下鄉避難，路鮮行人，一到晚上，只幾盞街燈，還掩映着微弱的光芒。他任第三區行政專員，公署廨舍，在城區臥龍山麓，在狹小的辦公室中，我同他談了一會紹與怎樣自衛的方策，這時他已創設三區政治工作隊，號召着越地靑年羣起抗戰，區政工隊辦過兩期，在對日僞政治作戰的時假，在海　的茶院鎭上，一大羣男女靑年，就流過大量的血，大量的汗。</p>
<p>賀氏自律甚嚴，二十八年的元旦，紹興社會，由安定而日趨頹廢，他寫了一篇「自我十號」，發表當地報上，以自勉勉人，措詞非常懇婉，「保衛大紹興」歌，也是地自撰請人譜曲，那時三區軍民，街頭巷尾，都會唱「鬼子們到了，鬼子們到了，越國的兒女們，快站到錢江的前哨………」的歌曲。</p>
<p>賀氏是文人出身，雖在軍政旁午的時候，星期休假，終同着李生翁，張天漢等作畫吟詩，在浙西時也是如此，不過從遊名士，換了張天方，曹天風，蔣大昕等，詩宗黃山谷，韓退之一派，從古拙中見性靈，對發揚民族救國意識，更趨積極，字近于右任氏體，得了者珍同拱　。</p>
<p>在浙西打擊日僞，援助盟軍，他做的工作雖沒有像三區一樣的飛揚，但沉靜堅毅，指揮策劃得更爲靈活。美杜立特將軍第一次轟炸東京，飛機在於潛失事下降，以及援引上海西人內渡，都由他策難扶助的。他的身體非常强健，到餐館中，喜吃大盤魚肉，狼呑虎　，山鄕的小菜館，往往被他吃得手忙脚亂，服裝極差，一套草綠斜紋軍裝，穿上三四年，還不肯換，望去眞像一個退伍落魄的軍人，穿馬靴不穿襪，一次訪友，主人堅請脫靴，弄得奇窘不堪。</p>
<p>「賀主任肯負責，在他下面做事，眞眞痛快」，這是許多軍政幹部一致的好評，職員離職，他終致送一筆路費，並殷殷詢問新機會的情形，同他交往的文友，都受到他的接濟，自罄私囊，結果變成現在的身後蕭條。</p>
<p>去世前，他在中央組織部任第三處處長，徒步進出，中午到小飯店中吃飯，習以爲常，當月前中旬　熱的時候，他因吃西瓜致病，初起時不以爲意，迨後以經濟拮据而延誤醫治，在二三天的短時期中，病情陡變，突吿不治，現在子女敎養費，正由浙省友好代籌，過去許多侮蔑他的關語，當可一掃而光了。</p>
<p>這位胡林翼型亂世政決家的殞沒，無疑是當前人材上的一大損失。</p>

<h3>United Nations Second General Assembly Inaugurated by Brazilian Representative; US to Request Delegation to Investigate Korean Situation; Foreign Minister Wang to Broadcast Meeting Details Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] New York, 16th (Radio dispatch): The 1947 United Nations General Assembly was formally inaugurated on the 16th, with hopes that the increasingly sharp contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union could be eased during this assembly. The opening ceremony was presided over by the chief representative of Brazil, Aranha, whose silver hair and elegant demeanor were remarkable. In his opening remarks to the assembly, he stated: The success or failure of the United Nations General Assembly will determine whether the world moves towards peace or towards war.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] New York, 16th (Radio dispatch): The head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky, arrived in New York on the 16th aboard the Queen Elizabeth. In a statement to reporters, he said: The Soviet Union will do its utmost to resolve the various difficulties and serious problems currently facing the United Nations. These problems can be resolved through mutual understanding and good-faith consultation. When asked if Molotov would travel to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky replied: He has no knowledge of that, and said: He is currently the head of the Soviet delegation, and it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. Representatives from the United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland, and Luxembourg arrived in New York on the same plane as Vyshinsky today. British Secretary of State McNeil stated: The abuse of the veto power has become commonplace, but at present, the United Kingdom does not intend to request amendments to the relevant provisions on the veto power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, due to pressing domestic affairs and the need to prepare for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London in November, may not be able to attend the UN General Assembly in person.

<h3>China Cannot Continue to Hesitate; Sun Ke Discusses Foreign Policy; China and the Soviet Union Can Return to Friendship; After Ambassador Wei's Report is Submitted, We Will Make Important Decisions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Vice President of the National Government Sun Ke exclusively met with a United Press reporter on the 16th and declared that after learning the results of General Wedemeyer's report to President Truman, the Chinese government will study whether it is more beneficial to unite with the United States or with the Soviet Union. If China is forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, the government and the CCP will inevitably be able to reach a peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>Vice President Sun stated that the Soviet Union's current policy towards China is based on fear, because once a public conflict occurs between the United States and the Soviet Union, China will stand on the side of the United States. If China does not have close ties with the United States, the Soviet Union will likely adopt a more friendly attitude towards China. Sun Ke also said that the Soviet Union wants China to become its friendly neighbor, but does not want China to ally with a strong country that could become its enemy, so China must struggle between the two powers to ensure that it can adapt itself to the most beneficial position for the present and the long term. Countries around the world do not form alliances for emotional reasons; every country considers its own national interests as its most important point. Sun Ke pointed out two ways to improve Sino-Soviet relations:</p>
<p>First, Moscow must restrain the CCP's armed resistance and help promote the unification of the Northeast and the CCP-occupied areas with the rest of China. Second, Dalian should be handed over to Chinese administration, and Lushun should be jointly managed in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. "If the Soviet Union can truly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and fully express its friendship, it will be sufficient for China to reconsider its attitude towards the Soviet Union." He explained that the main reason for the Soviet Union's past behavior towards China was its displeasure with the close relationship between China and the United States. The Soviet Union's refusal to give up Dalian and its actions in the Northeast were all expressions of its displeasure, but this was not the Soviet Union's intention to destroy our governance. Sun Ke solemnly pointed out that the policy shift is awaiting the submission of the Wedemeyer Report. This depends on the United States making its own decision. China cannot continue to hesitate; we must have a more effective policy to guide our future. We should understand the Soviet viewpoint and the Soviet fear that the United States is guiding Chinese policy. The main difference between our country and the Soviet government is that the Soviet Union has failed to comply with the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If the Soviet Union is not afraid that China will become an ally of the United States in the event of a public conflict, the Soviet Union may be willing to implement the treaty.</p>
<p>Sun admitted that the form of government that China is trying to establish is ideologically incompatible with the Soviet system. However, he said that if the Soviet Union does not interfere in China's internal affairs, we can live together in peace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparation Industrial Machinery; First Batch to be Allocated by Lottery</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The first batch of Japanese reparations materials, consisting of industrial machinery, is scheduled to be allocated by lottery in mid-September by China, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The machinery that the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to allocate to private factories in the first batch is currently being classified and numbered according to the machine cards that have been filled out, and statistics are being prepared to serve as the basis for proportional allocation to each unit after the lottery.</p>
<h3>Lin Yutang's Remarks; Comments on Ambassador Wei's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] A reporter asked Mr. Lin Yutang for his opinion on the statement made by our government regarding Wedemeyer's report. Mr. Lin said that inflation and the difficulties it has caused are also part of the price that our government has paid for the war in the past eight or nine years. The governments of the Allied countries should give more consideration to our country's difficulties and the nature and international significance of its war against the Communists. In short, it was the Americans who allowed the Communist tiger to raise its head in China. Now that the tiger has grown large, American personnel certainly have a responsibility to get rid of the tiger. The expression of opinions by the United States is actually useless; if it wants to help China, it must take action. Some American personnel have worked hard in the past four years to make China controlled by the Communist Party, so that in the next war, China will fight with the Communist countries instead of with the United States. I hope that the American people can now imagine more.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Wei Flies to Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 16th] General Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly back to Washington on the afternoon of the 16th. General Wei arrived here on the morning of the 16th and held a secret meeting with army and navy officers in the Central Pacific.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Ratifies Appropriation; Emergency Relief for Refugees in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Temporary Relief Committee to be established to handle</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The bandit disaster in Anhui Province is severe. The Executive Yuan specifically ordered the Ministry of Finance on the 12th and 13th of this month to allocate 2 billion yuan in emergency relief funds for the bandit disaster and remit it to the Anhui Provincial Government for proper and rapid relief efforts. This fund was submitted for report at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th and was ratified retroactively. After the allocation is handed over to the Anhui Provincial Government, its distribution will be handled by a temporary relief committee organized by the Provincial Government in conjunction with the Provincial Council and relevant agencies, groups, and impartial people from society.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Broadcasts; Another Conflict on the Sino-Mongolian Border</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS news report last night stating that Xinjiang Chinese troops and the Mongolian People's Republic had another border conflict in the Betik Bogd-Uul area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Moscow Radio reported from the TASS foreign capital, Ulaanbaatar, that the Mongolian Foreign Ministry listed seven instances of Chinese violations of the Mongolian border: the first on July 31 and the most recent on August 24.</p>
<h3>Madame Sun Yat-sen's Statement; Denies Running for National Assembly Delegate</h3>
<p>[This City News] Madame Sun Yat-sen, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, issued a statement yesterday (the 16th), firmly denying the news report that she would participate in the November National Assembly delegate election. Madame said: "This news is completely inaccurate. I have no intention of participating in political elections or government work. In addition, the news originated from Guangzhou, but I have no representative or formal address in Guangzhou." Madame Sun is currently the chairman of the China Welfare Fund Committee and is actively engaged in this nationwide relief work.</p>
<h3>T.V. Soong Flies from Shanghai to Nanjing; Reports on the Donation of Assets; List of Equity in the China Development Bank is also Brought Along</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] T.V. Soong flew from Shanghai to Nanjing by plane at 11:00 AM on the 16th to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting to be held on the morning of the 17th and report on the donation of his equity in the China Development Bank. It is reported that the list of his equity has also been brought along.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] A senior employee of the China Development Bank said: The value of the shares donated by Mr. T.V. Soong cannot be accurately determined because the shares of the Huainan Road and Mine Company and the Yangtze Electric Company are not publicly traded on the stock exchange, so their market value needs to be estimated by experts who will assess the assets of each enterprise and calculate their profitability. The China Development Bank will convene a board meeting specifically for this matter, which will take place after Mr. Soong returns to Nanjing and publicly discloses his detailed donation plan. The three types of shares represent enterprises with bright prospects. The Huainan Coal Mine has now become the main supplier of coal in Central China, and its economic value is self-evident, but the equipment suffered considerable damage during the enemy-puppet period, and foreign exchange must be used to replenish it. The Hankou Electric Appliance Company also suffered losses during the war, while the Yangtze Electric Company did not suffer significant losses. The electricity business is somewhat monopolistic, and there is a shortage of electricity everywhere, so the prospects for the business are good, and the valuation of its shares is naturally higher than that of general industries.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Reports on Election Affairs; Remedial Measures to be Determined Separately for Elections in the Pacification Zone; Constitutional Government Promotion Association Holds Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election General Office, answered various committee members' inquiries on election affairs at the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Committee meeting on the morning of the 16th, as follows: (1) The interpretation of election laws is limited to the jurisdiction of judicial organs. If election matters are found to be illegal, the election office should be held responsible. (2) In pacification zones or areas with war, such as the provinces of Northeast, North China, Northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan, the general election cannot be carried out in accordance with the law due to factual problems, and other measures must be formulated to remedy this. Therefore, this general election urgently hopes to be a true general election, and does not want the meaning of the general election to be diluted due to the special circumstances of a small number of regions. The Election General Office has recently reported the results of its investigation to the National Government, stating that there are more than 500 counties across the country that cannot conduct elections in accordance with current laws. The National Government has considered this and formulated measures, but they can only be implemented after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative process and promulgates them. (3) In the party nomination method, efforts must be made to ensure that some people who have served the society for many years and made greater contributions can be elected. Some concrete suggestions should be studied on this point and submitted to the government for adoption. (4) Regarding the decision on the number of National Assembly delegates allocated to trade unions in various places, Zhang said that he could not answer and that it should be determined according to the circumstances in each place. (5) Regarding the issue of illiterate people writing ballots, someone asked whether the election office personnel could write on their behalf? Zhang replied that the election office has stipulated that voters can temporarily ask anyone to write on their behalf when voting. (6) Voter registration was notified to governments at all levels in early February of this year for handling. If it can be rushed immediately, it can be completed on schedule. (7) Regarding the rigid regulations on candidates in party nominations, Zhang explained that party nominations can only make party members abide by party discipline, and do not restrict others, and are not related to general elections. Furthermore, the elected candidate is determined by the votes, and the candidate should naturally be the next largest number. (8) If officials impersonate trade union members in the local area to participate in elections, voters can stop them. (9) The elections for legislators, supervisors, and National Assembly delegates can be carried out simultaneously, but the former two must be elected separately in the regional or professional groups. For example, if the National Assembly delegates are elected by regional elections, then the legislators should be elected by professional groups. Conversely, if the legislators are elected by regional elections, then the National Assembly delegates must be elected by professional groups, that is, the same scope cannot conduct elections for two different identities. As for the supervisors, they are indirectly elected and do not conflict.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Constitutional Government Promotion Association held its fourth joint meeting on the morning of the 16th, presided over by President Sun Ke, and passed three proposals to be submitted to the government for consideration and implementation: (1) Request the government to allocate election funds to each province, city, and county based on the actual budget to facilitate the implementation of constitutional government. (2) Request the government to issue a general order to prohibit candidates from hosting banquets in various places to prevent electoral fraud. (3) Request the government to increase the basic salaries of civil servants to achieve the practical case of adjusting treatment. The proposed measures for this case are as follows: The monthly salary for appointed positions is changed to 1,200 yuan, the salary for special appointed positions is changed to 1,000 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the simplified appointed rank is changed to 880 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the recommended appointed rank is changed to 540 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the delegated appointed rank is changed to 300 yuan, and the monthly salaries of all positions in the simplified, recommended, and delegated appointed ranks, as well as employees, should be increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Northeast Border Markers Have Been Moved; Central Government Orders Investigation of the Truth; Aircraft Will be Dispatched to Eastern Mongolia to Distribute Political Decrees and Announcements</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 16th] The Northeast issue has many problems, especially international incidents, which attract attention. According to recent news from relevant sources, it has been reported that the border markers on the northwestern border have been moved eastward into our territory by the Mongolian side. It is reported that an order from the central government has arrived here to conduct an investigation to clarify the situation. In addition, the relationship between Eastern Mongolia and Outer Mongolia is quite mysterious. It is rumored that Outer Mongolia has sent cadres to control the puppet Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government. Another rumor says that Outer Mongolia is urging Eastern Mongolia to seek development to avoid being resented. It is said that our responsible agency is paying close attention to the development of the Mongolian banners in the Northeast, and will soon dispatch aircraft to the north to distribute Mongolian and Chinese political decrees and announcements.</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred Canadian Aircraft; Approved for Sale to Our Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 15th] A Canadian government spokesman said that the Department of External Affairs has approved the sale of 150 twin-engine Mosquito aircraft to the Chinese government by the War Assets Corporation. The British Royal Air Force used this type of aircraft for daylight bombing raids on German cities during the war. The Canadian Air Force believes that this type of aircraft is now obsolete and has recently declared 500 of them to be surplus assets, which are being sold by the government. This sale is based on the 1945 agreement stipulating that Canada will ship certain supplies to China, including aircraft. The selling price has not been announced, as the details are still being negotiated. Canada hopes to be paid in US dollars. The government spokesman stressed that this transaction is purely commercial and does not represent Canada's endorsement of Chinese policy. Canada has a policy of prohibiting the sale of military equipment to warring countries, but does not believe that the sale of these surplus aircraft violates this policy, because 150 aircraft are not enough to determine military victory or defeat. The spokesman declined to say whether this transaction will continue, but stressed that Canada does not want to engage in the arms trade.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Plan to Flee Southward; Defenses Along the Yangtze River Strengthened</h3>
<p>Yanfa Highway to be opened soon</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 16th] On the 15th, several thousand Communist bandits fought fiercely with the garrison troops in Zhanghuanggang, Guanglingzhen, and Xilaizhen in Northern Jiangsu, attempting to flee southward. The Chu Tong national warship has dispatched gunboats to patrol the Yangtze River to block them at any time. County Magistrate Xu has also ordered the strengthening of defenses along the Yangtze River. In addition, there are bandits in Yangku Nanxingqiao in Eastern Cheng. The self-defense forces went to suppress them on the morning of the 15th, and the bandits have fled northward.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Huaiyin, 16th] The National Army advancing eastward from Lianghuai has reached the line of Nanzhuji and Xiajiji (southeast of Lianshui). The troops launching from Yanfu have captured Dugou and Yilin, and the two routes are about to converge. The Yanfu Highway is expected to be opened in the short term. The road surface from Huaiyin to Machang has now been repaired. The local telecommunications bureau has also fully prepared the necessary equipment to erect lines at any time. Furthermore, the National Army recovered Cheqiao, fifty li east of Huai'an, on the afternoon of the 13th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation to Open Flights to Xi'an and Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>[This City News] Due to the obstruction of traffic on the western section of the Longhai Railway, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation to increase flights to Xi'an and Zhengzhou to maintain traffic between the two places. It is reported that China National Aviation Corporation has dispatched a special plane to fly between the two places every day since the 7th of this month, making several round trips each day. Now, by order of the ministry, it plans to add flights between Xi'an and Zhengzhou three times a week to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Pingjinbao Triangle Area; The War is Coming to an End; The National Army is Pursuing Southward with a Large Group of Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Baoding, 16th] The bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area have collapsed and retreated to the south bank of the Daqing River and continued to retreat to Renqiu. A large group of National Army soldiers is advancing south to pursue them. The National Army in Baoding marched north on the 16th to take over the defense of Xushui. The elite brigade stationed in Xu attacked eastward to encircle and suppress the bandits who invaded Zhuoxian County.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Baoding, 6th] The person in charge of the Hebei military and political affairs told reporters today that the war in the Pingjinbao triangle area is coming to an end. Wang Li, a member of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops, has suffered nearly half of his losses since launching an offensive on the 10th. In recent days, the National Army has taken the initiative and adopted encirclement, isolation, and ambush strategies between the Daqing River and the Xiongba Highway. The army and air force are cooperating and taking advantage of the victory to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits' attempt to invade the Pingjinbao triangle area has been completely defeated by the National Army. Currently, Gu'an, Yongqing, Xiongxian, Baxian, Xinzhen, and Rongcheng are all under the control of the National Army. Furthermore, the provincial government has specially allocated 1 billion yuan for demobilization expenses to accompany the army's advance and 30 million yuan for relief expenses to each county, striving for military and political unity and ensuring the connection between the three major strongholds of Pingjinbao. In addition, the Hebei bandits have launched continuous offensives against the Pingbao Line, Shimen, Laishui, and the triangle area this year, all of which have been fatally struck by the National Army. The source of soldiers urgently needs to be replenished. The National Army will eliminate the bandits wandering around in various places in one fell swoop. The bandits who are currently harassing the Pingbao Line will also be driven away. The situation in Hebei Province will have a new development in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 16th] The Communist bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area have been broken up into smaller groups. The National Army has completely controlled the Xiongxian and Xinzhen areas. Continuing mopping-up operations are underway in the west of Wen'an.</p>
<h3>Impressions of General Chen Mingren</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>The Huizhou campaign in 1925 was an important key to the National Revolutionary Army's suppression of Chen Jiongming and the consolidation of the entire Guangdong. After besieging the city, a fierce attack followed. A 22-year-old platoon leader took the lead, climbed the city wall, raised a military flag, boosted morale, and captured the bandit's nest. This platoon leader was Chen Mingren, who, 21 years later, became a two-star general whose fame shook the four corners of Sipingjie. The Huizhou campaign made Commander-in-Chief Chiang appreciate his bravery and resourcefulness, and the Battle of Sipingjie showed his determination. Twenty-two years ago, he received a gold medal. Twenty-two years later, he received a well-known reputation. What is the same is that these honors were all earned at the risk of life.</p>
<p>Wearing a government-issued uniform made of herringbone fabric, with a commemorative badge for President Chiang's 60th birthday celebration in the Northeast last year fastened to his right chest, and with a face tanned by the wind and dust that would not fade, he had a cluster of abnormally firm, black and dense beard. This is General Chen Mingren. He speaks with a bit of Hunan accent, and his tone is always decisive:</p>
<p>"Your newspaper has a Mr. Qingtao in the Northeast, right!" He said bluntly, "We've met." That's how we started talking.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sipingjie Defense War, General Chen seemed less interested than usual. He smiled slightly:</p>
<p>"A total of forty-two days..." He didn't say much because the newspaper reports were enough, and his wind-swept complexion and firm beard gave an impression that was better than a thousand words. He said:</p>
<p>"The Northeast is very peaceful now. After the bandits suffered losses last time, they have not had the ability and resistance to come back and make trouble. With Chief Chen in the Northeast, everything will naturally be more stable. The day before yesterday, I saw President Chiang. He and his wife kept me for dinner and asked me in detail about the Sipingjie Defense War and the bandit situation in the Northeast recently. He also gave me three weeks of vacation so that I can go back to my hometown in Hunan. I haven't been back for ten years!"</p>
<p>Chen Mingren is the Communist Party's deadly enemy. In 1929, in his hometown of Liling, the Communist Party (then called "Red Bandits") killed his father. Eighteen years later, the Communist bandits in the Northeast almost took his life again. His younger brother Chen Mingxin was captured in Siping and there is still no news. Public and private feuds are combined, and he is ready to fight the Communist bandits to the end.</p>
<p>"If they dare to fight, let them come. We have long been replenished and prepared!"</p>
<p>He touched his cluster of black beard.</p>

<h3>Electricity Price Calculation Formula: Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Other Principles</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Economic Council drafted a price calculation formula for public utilities, including eight items for electricity price calculation, including fuel, foreign exchange, and wages.

Therefore, it consulted with relevant parties and electrical experts for detailed research and formulated other "Principles for Electricity Price Adjustment Calculation Formula," which only includes the major parts. One is the fuel cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity sold, and the other is the operating cost per kilowatt-hour of old electricity.

<h3>South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee Established: Offices Set Up in Wuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] The South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee was established on the morning of the 16th. Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank and Chairman of the Committee, flew from Shanghai on the 15th to preside over the ceremony. Zhang pointed out the special economic situation in South China and gave detailed instructions on policies and guidelines. The branch's jurisdiction covers Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces, and the original Guizhou business will continue to be handled. Offices will be set up in Wuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Ji'ao recently told reporters: He came here to preside over the establishment of the South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee and to inspect the affairs of the Central Branch. The main tasks of the establishment of the committee are: (1) To study the use of economic power to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling, so that export foreign exchange belongs to the government. If smuggling is reduced, the black market foreign exchange can also be reduced, and overseas remittances will not be wasted. (2) Investigate the needs of local people's livelihood and public utilities as a basis for quotas. (3) Investigate smuggling and study coping methods. (4) Announce central economic policies and orders and forward local difficulties to the central government. (5) Pay attention to increasing overseas remittances and study improvement methods. (6) Pay attention to changes in Hong Kong's economic and financial policies, take necessary measures, and maintain national and local interests at any time, while maintaining good economic relations between Guangdong and Hong Kong. Zhang also said: To eliminate the black market for gold and foreign exchange and the problem of smuggling, the main thing depends on the change in the psychology of the people. They must trust the government, sacrifice their personal petty interests, and love the country before there is a solution. Zhang said that the rumors that he would issue 50,000 yuan banknotes are all rumors.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Encourages Subordinates: Implement the Three Observances and Three No's Movement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] Director Zhang Fakui of the Northeast Headquarters recently convened officers of various units under his command to encourage them to implement the "Three Observances," namely, observing time, observing discipline, and observing responsibility; and the "Three No's," namely, no selfishness, no corruption, and no falsehoods, in order to create a good atmosphere.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Director Rooks: Scheduled to Depart for China at the End of the Month: Discuss Unfinished Business of Relief Program</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 15th Dispatch] According to UNRRA officials, UNRRA Director Rooks will go to China at the end of this month to discuss the unfinished business of the relief program to China, which will end at the end of this year, with the Chinese government. According to Fa Jinren, Rooks's departure date has not been set, but he plans to go to China at the end of the month to investigate the progress of UNRRA's work in China and decide whether UNRRA should insist on its policy of no political discrimination in its distribution in China. It is reported that UNRRA is negotiating with our government to reach an agreement on the issue of material distribution in Communist-controlled areas. Observers here believe that if an agreement cannot be reached, the nine-nation central committee of UNRRA may ask the Chinese government to distribute approximately US$6 million worth of supplies designated for Communist areas, or may request a reduction in part of the relief program to China, so that UNRRA's attitude is that the Chinese government and the Communists have failed to reach an agreement on the transportation of materials to Communist areas and should not be blamed on the National Government. In addition, the unfinished business under the Chinese relief program includes approximately 30 million yuan worth of medical supplies and machinery needed for post-disaster relief. How to handle these matters is still awaiting Rooks's recommendation to the Central Committee.</p>
<h3>Trade Between Northeast and Inland: Adjustment Measures Revised Again: Headquarters Formulates Plan to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 16th Dispatch] Trade between the Northeast and the inland was originally restricted by the "Interim Measures for Adjusting the Import and Export of Goods" promulgated by the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters. In order to adapt to the current economic situation in the Northeast, adjust Northeast materials, and assist the resumption of work in industry and mining, the committee has revised the above measures again and announced them today. Exports are divided into three categories: (1) Freely Exported Category: Materials that are very abundant in the Northeast and needed in other places can be freely exported outside the Northeast without applying for permission. (2) Consigned Export Category: Materials that are abundant in the Northeast but also in great demand in the region, with a value of more than 50,000 circulating notes or a weight of more than 50 kilograms, should be applied for before export and consigned after approval. (3) Prohibited Export Category: Except for the needs of public institutions that have been approved by the Economic Committee, no consignments are allowed. This revision has actually eliminated the economic emergency measures plan previously announced by the committee but has not been effective. The plan did not have provisions for a freely exported category. As for soybeans and coal, which were originally prohibited from being withdrawn, separate instructions will be requested. The financial measures on tightening credit in the economic emergency measures plan will continue to be effective.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Changchun, 16th Dispatch] The Northeast Headquarters is determined to suppress and stabilize prices, crack down on hoarding, and manage foreign exchange, and has prepared plans. Effective measures have also been taken for soybeans related to foreign exchange. Although the Sino-Soviet Railway is restored, it will also be partially frozen. Therefore, the price of soybeans in Changchun City has fallen since the afternoon yesterday, by more than ten yuan per catty.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Seeks to Increase Paper Production: Convenes Meeting of Relevant Agencies to Discuss: Formulate Improvement Opinions and Submit to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] In order to increase paper production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently convened a meeting of relevant agencies and paper experts to discuss the current difficulties in the paper industry and formulated improvement opinions. The most lacking thing in our paper industry is fake raw materials. The country needs about 400 tons of pulp per day, but copper wire cloth and blankets are almost entirely dependent on imports. Domestically made blankets are not fully applicable. Our domestic wood cannot be produced in large quantities. The wood pulp produced by various factories in Sichuan, except for a part used to make banknote paper, is still not enough for the province. Taiwan's wood pulp and bagasse pulp, in addition to supplying the province's newspaper production, can be partially transported to Shanghai, but the villi are too short. The Jinzhou and Yingkou pulp mills in Tianjin and Northeast China all use reeds as their main raw material and have not yet started construction. Recently, there have been proposals to relocate the above-mentioned pulp mills internally, but it is not easy to implement them at once. As for the suggestion that pulp should be included as a major item in Soviet barter trade, it is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to build our own factories. It is found that the foreign exchange spent on purchasing pulp and paper each year is about 18 million US dollars. If this foreign exchange is used to establish a pulp mill, the amount saved each year in the future will be more than this number. The cost of copper wire cloth and blankets is about 500,000 US dollars each. If a copper wire cloth factory and a blanket factory are established separately, they can ship goods after eighteen months, which is enough to meet the needs of all paper mills in China, and the foreign exchange saved each year will just match the above number. They are now being submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and are being submitted to the Resources Committee to study, select and implement them in conjunction with relevant agencies. Five Times Longer Than the Pearl River Bridge</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Southwest Grand Iron Bridge: Construction Will Resume Within Half a Year: Five Times Longer Than the Pearl River Bridge</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 15th Dispatch] The Guangzhou Southwest Grand Iron Bridge spans the Pearl River and is an important construction project for connecting the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. A part of the bridge pier project was completed before the war. After the restoration, due to financial exhaustion, construction has not been resumed. In April of this year, the Municipal Government, the Provincial Government, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau negotiated the construction. At the beginning of August, it was decided to entrust the China Bridge Company to handle it. The required steel beams were requested by the Railway Bureau to be allocated by the Ministry of Transportation. The construction cost was advanced by the China Bridge Company and will be repaid from the fees collected from trains and cars passing through the bridge in the future. The contract was signed on September 1st, stipulating that construction will start within half a year after the signing of the contract. It will be completed within six months after all the towns and - have been transported. The bridge spans the Pearl River and its tributary river surface and is five times longer than the Pearl River Iron Bridge. The bridge deck is divided into train, car, and pedestrian lanes, and is the largest machine beam in the southwest.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Critical Juncture of the United Nations</h3>
<p>The second session of the United Nations General Assembly officially opened yesterday at Lake Success. At a time when numerous global issues are urgently awaiting resolution, the opening of the UN General Assembly undoubtedly brings renewed hope to the world. Consequently, all nations are giving this session their utmost attention. Our government's diplomatic authorities, in recognition of the significance of this UN General Assembly, have dispatched Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to personally attend. It is hoped that this session can dispel the international gloom and usher in an era of peace and prosperity, while also providing an opportunity to resolve the stalemate in the Far East. As Foreign Minister Wang stated in New York, "This General Assembly is the most important one yet and will determine the fate of the United Nations; we must ensure its success. For the sake of world peace, both Europe and Asia must swiftly achieve peace, or the situation will deteriorate to a point where major powers lose control. The issues to be discussed at the UN General Assembly are all of significant importance in maintaining world peace." Today's world has reached a critical juncture of unity and division. The success or failure of this UN General Assembly is tied to the safety of the world and the fate of humanity. The U.S. diplomatic authorities are also placing special emphasis on this session, not only offering their full support to the United Nations, but also striving to secure its success, ensuring that it becomes a truly effective international organization capable of maintaining world peace and promoting human well-being.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, the speeches heard and seen at the opening of the UN General Assembly have focused on praising the UN's peace efforts and proclaiming aspirations for future peace and security. This is certainly enough to strengthen the world's faith and hope in the UN, but it is premature to judge the success or failure of this session at this stage. Leaving aside the broader environment outside the UN General Assembly, the issues to be discussed at this session alone are enough to illustrate the immense challenges involved, which are beyond the imagination of most people. According to a United Press report, the most thorny difficulties facing this session include: (1) the issue of the veto power and its implications for amending the UN Charter; (2) breaking the impasse in the Korean situation; (3) resolving the Balkan issue; (4) the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states; (5) universal security, involving the control of atomic energy and the establishment of an international police force; (6) the Indonesian issue; (7) the disarmament of countries worldwide; (8) the handling of the Franco regime in Spain; (9) the racial discrimination issue in India and South Africa; and (10) other important international issues.</p>
<p>All the above issues contain complex and delicate international factors and are closely related to maintaining world peace. If this UN General Assembly fails to seize the opportunity and effectively utilize the situation to find reasonable solutions to these international problems, they could all erupt into sources of international conflict at any time. Certain nations with a special responsibility for world peace should particularly recognize the gravity of these issues and not take them lightly, allowing them to drag on and fester in the international undercurrents, eventually becoming sources of international chaos. As a United Press dispatch from New York on the 12th stated, "Not only is the agenda for this General Assembly filled with explosive issues, but the United States is also prepared to 'confront' the Soviet Union and determine who is stronger. Secretary of State Marshall will personally handle anti-communist actions. The eagle of the United States and the bear of the Soviet Union are about to engage in a cold war."</p>
<p>While United Press's report may be alarmist and exaggerated, it also has a certain basis. Although the U.S. government and public are united in supporting the United Nations and believe that it will never succeed without the enthusiastic support of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the vision that the U.S. government and public had when the United Nations was established during the war has now been completely shattered. This is truly a great tragedy for humanity. It is worth remembering that during the San Francisco Conference, all the United Nations were fighting shoulder-to-shoulder on the battlefield. Therefore, they were more willing to tolerate and compromise with each other at the conference, creating an atmosphere of harmony and friendship. A United Nations Charter was passed smoothly, serving as the basis for constructing world peace after the war. However, after the victorious end of the war, the UN organization, although holding various meetings in London and New York, has failed to achieve the intended effect due to internal disagreements. According to our statistics, the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power in the Security Council as many as eighteen times. How can the UN organization become an effective international body under these conditions? Therefore, the issue of the veto power is not only related to amending the UN Charter but also has a significant impact on the true effectiveness of the UN organization.</p>
<p>From this, we can also see that the root cause of the UN organization's paralyzed state lies in the irreconcilable differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. During the war, because victory was the priority, everyone was able to tolerate and compromise, cooperating sincerely and fighting shoulder-to-shoulder. But after victory, as circumstances changed, self-interest became the priority. On matters related to their own interests, the emotions of both sides deteriorated with each dispute, leading to an irreconcilable situation. The UN organization, caught in the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, naturally finds it difficult to function effectively. Although the U.S. is in a leadership position and easily gains the sympathy of countries around the world, often gaining the upper hand in various UN meetings, the Soviet Union has the veto power, which is enough to counter the U.S., creating a stalemate. Therefore, we believe that as long as both the U.S. and the Soviet Union prioritize peace and their conscience is not blinded by selfish desires, and everyone treats each other with sincerity, not only will the dark clouds and grim atmosphere between the U.S. and the Soviet Union disappear immediately, but the international community will also immediately radiate the sunshine of peace. The problems facing the UN General Assembly will not be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>In short, when we look up at the world today and then look down at the difficulties facing the United Nations, the future of the world is not something to be overly optimistic about. We only hope that the political and diplomatic leaders of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union can use their political wisdom to strive for the success of the United Nations. The U.S. diplomatic authorities are already moving in this direction, but we do not know if the Soviet Union will also take the same steps. The alignment of the steps of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will ensure the success of the United Nations. Therefore, the success or failure of the United Nations, the unity or division of the world, has reached a final juncture and will depend on the attitude and efforts taken by the representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet Union at this UN General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Greek Question Removed from UN Security Council Agenda - Soviet Union's Veto Fails</h3>
<p>[Lake Success, 16th (Reuters)] After heated debate, the United Nations Security Council decided last night to remove the Greek issue from its agenda, allowing the UN General Assembly to discuss the matter. The debate began with discussion of a U.S. resolution requesting the General Assembly to resolve Greece's current difficulties. Australia supported the U.S. proposal, but the Soviet representative argued that this would further complicate the Greek issue. The French representative, Mr. Parodi, believed that since the Security Council's discussion of the Greek issue had reached a stalemate, the U.S. proposal might be a way to break it. At this point, Mr. Gromyko used his veto power to reject the U.S. proposal. The U.S. representative then proposed that the resolution be treated as a procedural matter, but this was also vetoed by the Soviet Union. The U.S. representative had no choice but to submit a new procedural resolution requesting that the Greek issue be removed from the agenda. As a procedural resolution, it was not subject to the veto power. The vote was nine in favor and two against (Soviet Union and Poland). Because the veto power did not apply, the motion was passed.</p>
<p>[Lake Success, 15th (United Press)] Tonight, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power twice in the UN Security Council to prevent the U.S. from bringing the Balkan issue to the UN General Assembly for discussion. However, the door for the General Assembly to discuss the issue was opened by another U.S. motion, which was passed despite Soviet opposition.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Mr. Gromyko stated that the U.S.'s new proposal had the same motive as the previously vetoed one, namely to implicate several innocent governments in order to exonerate the Greek government. This shows the extreme crudeness of U.S. foreign policy. The Balkan issue was earlier proposed by the U.S. to be included on the agenda of the General Assembly, but according to the UN Charter, the General Assembly's discussion should be limited to cases where the Security Council requests an opinion or removes the matter from its own agenda. Today, the U.S. proposed that the Security Council request the General Assembly to find a solution to the Balkan issue, which passed with nine votes in favor and two against, with the Soviet Union and Poland voting against. Soviet representative Mr. Gromyko, in his capacity as the rotating president of the Security Council for this month, ruled that this was a substantive issue and therefore could exercise his veto power. U.S. representative Mr. Johnson argued that it was a procedural matter, which passed with eight votes in favor, two against, and Syria abstaining, with the Soviet Union and Poland voting against.</p>

<h3>800,000 Italian Workers on General Strike - Attempt to Overthrow Current Cabinet - Communist Party Manipulation Causes Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>[Rome, 16th (United Press)] 850,000 Italian metalworkers began a general strike on the 16th, marking the first time in history that the Italian Communist Party has demonstrated such power in the labor movement. Today's strike by metalworkers began quietly, but they are determined to follow the Communist Party's lead in overthrowing the non-leftist cabinet. This is evidenced by the brewing of additional strikes in other industrial sectors. The Communist Party and the Left Socialist Party have launched four labor strikes within days to threaten the government, indicating a possible use of violence to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>[Rome, 15th (United Press)] The labor union controlled by the Communist Party rejected all calls to end the strike on the 15th and plans to mobilize 4 million workers to strike, creating the most dangerous labor unrest in Italian history to achieve the goal of overthrowing the De Gasperi cabinet. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti wants to establish a left-wing regime or at least obtain a cabinet position in the government. He issued a warning, saying, "Workers are willing to remain patient, but not indefinitely."</p>
<h3>Britain Prepares to Withdraw from the Holy Land - Will Explain Position to General Assembly</h3>
<p>[London, 16th (Reuters)] British official opinion has recognized that the complete withdrawal of British forces from Palestine is inevitable. Government sources told this agency this morning that the cabinet could decide as early as Thursday when to begin the withdrawal and the technical issues involved.

<p>[Cleveland, Ohio, 15th (Reuters)] U.S. Commerce Secretary Harriman spoke frankly to the local Chamber of Commerce today, warning Britain that if it wants to be an active participant in the reconstruction of Europe, it must resume coal exports. "Otherwise, Britain cannot serve as an oar in the world's ship."

<p>Failure to Reach Agreement Within Government</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 16th (New Asia News Agency)] The National Coal Mine Management Bill and the Economic Power Concentration Exclusion Bill have both been postponed until the regular cabinet meeting on the 20th.

<h3>Soviet Merchant Ship Ignores Protests and Plans to Come to Shanghai Again; Anchors Outside the Port; We Reject the Soviet Consul-General's Request to Allow the "Erich" to Enter the Port; Authorities Closely Monitor Imports and Resolve to Detain It</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Soviet ship "Erich" arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on August 9th and September 4th this year to repatriate overseas Chinese in two batches, and violated our laws twice by carrying passengers and goods from Dalian to Shanghai without authorization. When the ship returned to its country last time, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Soviet authorities, and warned the ship not to enter the port again. Unexpectedly, before the previous case was closed, the ship dared to disregard our country's laws and ignore our protests, and sailed to Shanghai again at 11:45 am yesterday, anchoring on the Tongsha sea off Wusong. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai Office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately notified the Customs and Navigation authorities not to allow it to enter the port, and all procedures would not be processed. It also notified the Garrison Headquarters to send military police to monitor it. If the ship still attempts to enter the port rashly, it will be detained. According to reporters from relevant sources, the ship had not entered the port as of 10:00 pm last night. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally did not object to the Soviet Union sending other ships to Shanghai to repatriate overseas Chinese, but only because the "Erich" has repeatedly ignored our government orders, it had to take this measure. It is reported that more than 1,000 Soviet overseas Chinese have registered for the third batch of ships to return to their country.</p>
<p>Another report: The Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai has sent a reply to the Shanghai Office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the previous case of the "Erich" entering Shanghai without authorization. The reply raised objections to the violation of our government's regulations on suspending the opening of the Dalian port, arguing that Dalian is still in a state of war and Soviet ships have the right to navigate freely. As for the ship carrying passengers and goods, it admitted its mistake. The reply also requested the cancellation of the ban on the "Erich" sailing to Shanghai again. After receiving the reply, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs resolutely refused to cancel the ban.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of taking back the racecourse, which is of concern to the citizens of this city, since it was first proposed for discussion at the first general meeting of the Municipal Council last year, the Municipal Government has sent representatives to make informal negotiations with the owners of the racecourse property.

<p>Recently, they have also voluntarily stopped using the neon lights of the dancers' names, and dancers refuse to accept flower baskets and other souvenirs when entering the venue. Dancers' clothing also uses domestic goods as much as possible, with simplicity as the main principle. Shanghai has a history of dancing for more than thirty years. More than 200,000 people directly and indirectly rely on this for a living. If it is banned all at once, it will be difficult to change careers for a while, and they will be unable to earn a living. Therefore, they hope that the government will reconsider. Mayor Wu said that banning dancing is the intention of the government. When implemented in this city, we should try our best to give all employees the opportunity to change careers. Wu also said that he is very aware of the difficulties of the dance industry, and has submitted opinions to the Central Government on their behalf. At present, the principle of banning dancing cannot be changed, and we can only try our best to find ways to extend the banning period and phase out the industry in stages in the implementation methods. If the Central Government adopts this method, it will be implemented gradually, so as to give people the opportunity to change careers.</p>

She answered vaguely. When asked why the words "Wu Guozhen" were written on the savings book, and whether she knew "Wu Guozhen", the madwoman said that she did not know Wu Guozhen. Finally, Mayor Wu asked her if she had been deceived by others or suffered any other harm, and promised to instruct his subordinates to investigate.

<h3>### Bloodshed on Haifang Road: Murderer Enters Room by Window at Dawn and Brutally Chops with Axe - Husband Dies, Wife Wounded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shen Rongji's Yarn Factory owner, Shen Youren, 42, from Shaoxing, who resided in a bungalow at No. 358, Lane 391, Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, lost his wife, Ms. He, to illness ten years ago, leaving behind a son, named Hen, 15, and a daughter, Qingying, 14. Due to the lack of a person to manage the household, he remarried a widow from Ningbo, Zhang Shixiang (44 years old), as his wife through an introduction. For the past nine years, their relationship has been good. They had two sons and a daughter, but both sons have died young, leaving only a daughter, Rongmei, who is only four years old. The family of five lived harmoniously. Shen, his wife Zhang, and his young daughter Rongmei slept together on the loft above the front building. Unexpectedly, at around 5 a.m. at dawn, a thug removed four sections of the window lattice, climbed inside, shone a flashlight on Shen's face, and then brutally chopped Shen's neck with a sharp axe, about an inch deep. Shen quickly got up in pain and saw someone escaping through the window. He bravely jumped down to chase, but accidentally fell to the ground, causing a hole in the back of his head, and his breath was faint. At this time, another thug remained in the room. Zhang was awakened by the noise in her sleep and got up to grab his hand, but because the lights were off, she couldn't recognize his face. She didn't know it was the murderer, and she was chopped six or seven times on her chest, right chest, and breasts, with blood gushing out like a spring. She released her hand in pain.</p>
<p>The culprit then fled. After being injured, she rushed downstairs, but fainted from the pain at the entrance of West Grave Lane downstairs. At that time, Shen's nephew, Yonglin, and neighbor, Xi Tian, and others heard the noise and went out to investigate, seeing Zhang covered in blood and Shen Youren barely breathing. They quickly called an ambulance to the scene and rushed the injured to Pingmin Hospital on Xinzha Road. Shen died soon after due to his serious injuries.</p>
<p>Xi Tian immediately reported the robbery to the Jiangning Police Branch, and Branch Chief Wang Xinheng personally led Section Chief Chen Kaizhou, Police Chief Wang Qi, and others to the scene of the incident to investigate the details of the tragedy. After receiving the report, the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau also ordered staff member Chen Xianrong to rush to the scene and photograph the culprit's footprints to facilitate the investigation. According to eyewitnesses, they saw two people in black clothes fleeing away at the time, so it can be confirmed that there were actually two criminals. As for Zhang's remarriage, her previous husband passed away ten years ago. It is impossible to determine whether it contains an affair. However, according to the police officers handling the case, Zhang is over forty years old and one of her eyes is already blind, so it seems that the element of revenge is more likely. The branch is currently secretly investigating this.</p>
<h3>### "Tangyuan Little Wu's" List of Crimes: Skilled at "Eating Soft Rice" Among the Female Entertainers</h3>
<p>There are countless cases of men defrauding women of their jewelry in Shanghai. Wu Baoxiang, nicknamed "Tangyuan Little Wu," 30 years old, from Hangzhou (also known as Wu Boxiang), was arrested by the police for fraud and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 10th of this month. It is now learned that the District Prosecutor's Office has completed the investigation procedures because the suspect has confessed to his crimes to the police. Yesterday, Prosecutor Chen Shoutao filed a public prosecution. The reporter has learned the truth as follows: Wu Baoxiang, unemployed, specializes in setting up scams to make a living. He studied at National Fudan University and left the school in 1937. He then worked as a second-class postal officer at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. After the war, he was transferred to Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai in 1941, where he worked in the stock exchange. Since then, he has engaged in this illegal behavior. From June of last year to April of this year, he has successively used despicable means to defraud a large amount of property, totaling seven cases. The first time was in June of last year, when Wu met a dancer named Pan Liping at the Sichuan Road nightclub. Seeing that Pan had a flat gold bracelet on her hand, he became malicious. The next day, he managed to invite the dancer to the Yiyuan Nightclub. When the dancing ended, he</p>
<p>Used the excuse of admiration</p>
<p>To trick her and escape into the crowd. The next day, he went to the Xintianhua Silver Building on Baoshan Road in Zhabei and exchanged it for 320,600 yuan, and there is an invoice from the building to prove it. The second time was at 10 a.m. on August 17 last year, Wu impersonated a friend named Mao Hongfa and called No. 96 Jing'an Villa, claiming to collect three pieces of Western-style clothing materials. After obtaining them, he sold one piece to a friend from Taiwan, Wang Jiu, and made the other two pieces into Western suits himself. The third time was on September 13 last year, when he met a former dancer named Li at the Weida Dance Hall on Xiahfei Road. Li was eager to return to Qingdao, but was worried about the lack of travel expenses, so she asked Wu to exchange her gold bracelet for cash. Wu pretended to be honest and paid Li 100,000 yuan first. Later, Wu embezzled the 320,000 yuan he exchanged for his own use. The fourth time was at 9 a.m. on October 4 last year, Wu again</p>
<p>Played a new trick</p>
<p>Carrying a red mesh bag with a brand new 1,000-yuan bill visible on the outside, seemingly a large amount of cash, but in fact, only the surface was a 1,000-yuan bill, and the inside was all grass paper. He went to Yunxia Fashion Company at No. 988 Nanjing West Road to buy clothing materials, and instructed them to send the pre-selected yellow wolf fur coat and woolen coat to Room 313, Yuelai Apartment, No. 592 Lane, Nanjing West Road. Wu went there as promised and put the fake money on the table first. When the fashion company clerk arrived, he falsely claimed that he needed to take the coat to his girlfriend's room across the street to try it on, leaving the money on the table. The clerk did not suspect anything else and was tricked. Wu went to Pudong Dongchang Road and pawned it that day for his own use. The fifth time was at 9 a.m. in November last year, Wu tricked Li Huifang, whom he met through</p>
<p>Wang Ji Photo Studio</p>
<p>into going out to play after meeting at Room 38, Pacific Hotel, No. 12, Lane 470, Shaanxi North Road, and then used the excuse of admiring them to trick her out of her jewelry worth 3 taels and 8 mace, and two 3-carat diamond rings. He exchanged them for 897,000 yuan at the Lao Tianbao Silver Building in Xiaodongmen, and sold the two 3-carat diamond rings to his friend Wang Jie, all of which were used up. The sixth time was on February 20 of this year, Wu went to the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall on Nanjing Road and took the dancer Ni Yaomei to the Dahu Dance Hall to play. When the dance ended, he used the excuse of playing with Ni's gold bracelet on his hand and ran away. He then exchanged it for 600,000 yuan at the Central Bank for his own use. The seventh time was in late April of this year, Wu danced with friends at the Atlantic Cafe, and thus met a prostitute named Sanyuan. Through Sanyuan's introduction, he met another prostitute named Meimei (also known as Wu Fengjin). Wu saw that Meimei had a lot of jewelry and immediately had evil intentions. Later, he invited Wu to drink coffee, dance, and watch movies, and then invited her to Room 207 of the Shanghai Hotel in Hongkou. Under the pretext of urging Meimei to take a bath, he stole her jewelry and exchanged it for more than 5 million yuan. He spent it all in Hangzhou that night. The above seven fraud facts have been proven, and all have been confirmed in detail by the victims as being committed by "Tangyuan Little Wu." His behavior of making fraud his regular occupation is truly unforgivable.</p>

<h3>Visiting Ancient Relics in Linqiong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 13th] Qionglai County in Western Sichuan suffered from floods last month, and the Xihe River in the county overflowed, with many dikes along the river being destroyed. On the 28th, the flood collapsed the riverbank of Banzhulin in the west of the city. The next day, Tang Dynasty relics were discovered at the collapsed riverbank, including various kinds of stone carvings, sculptures, and castings. There are also many Yuan Dynasty stone carvings, exquisitely carved and magnificently sculpted, of great historical value. This has aroused the research interest of archaeological and historical scholars in Southwest China. Yesterday, the reporter drove to the site of the ancient relics to take a look.</p>
<p>Qionglai is 180 miles east of Chengdu, formerly known as Linqiong. In the Qing Dynasty, it was changed to Qiong Prefecture, and in the Republic of China, it was changed to its current name. It is the hometown of the famous literary figures Sima Xiangru and Zhuo Wenjun's elopement. On the morning of the 11th, the reporter took a bus from Chengdu. Along the way, the autumn rice was early ripening, the wheat ears were growing strongly, and the branches were drooping like grapes. Farmers were busy threshing and drying grain. Near the river, there were still dilapidated tiles, broken walls, sandy and stony fields, and many collapsed buildings. Everywhere there were refugees after the disaster, skinny and haggard, living in temporary shelters. The signs of the flood were clearly visible. At noon, they arrived in Qionglai. The shops in the city were densely packed and quite prosperous. There are many relics of romantic stories here, such as Sima Xiangru's reading place, the place where he played the zither to entice Zhuo Wenjun, and the place where Zhuo Wenjun sold wine by the stove. After entering the city, after a brief visit, they went to the Folk Education Hall to see the ancient relics.</p>
<p>At the museum, they heard from the person in charge that this batch of ancient relics was discovered on the 28th of last month after a flood collapsed the Xihe River (Qiongshui), and a dozen meters of the dike on the south side of the city was destroyed. But many of them were taken away by local tyrants, and the government only saved part of them. He guided the reporter to visit the first part, which was stone carvings, statues of Buddha, Vajra guardians, Dharma protectors, Guanyin, etc., with inscriptions such as Kai Cheng (Emperor Wenzong of Tang Dynasty), Xian Tong (Emperor Wuzong of Tang Dynasty), etc. The iron strokes and silver hooks are exquisitely carved, the lines are smooth, and the shapes and structures are lively and solemn. They look lifelike, and the performance is quite similar to the Western Realist style, which can be compared with the Tang Dynasty murals in the Mogao Caves. The second part is bronze castings and stone sculptures of large and small Buddha statues. The larger ones are seven or eight feet high, and the smaller ones are only five or six inches. The lines of the wheels and temples are beautiful and lively, and the jewelry, hair, eyebrows, and eyes on the head are extremely vivid. There is a bronze Guanyin statue that looks like a Qiang person and is several feet tall. It fully expresses the solemnity and greatness of Buddhism, and is inscribed with Huichang (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty) three years. The third part is various sutra pillars and stupas. The sizes and forms of the sutra pillars are different, the designs are beautiful, and the carvings are exquisite. The smaller ones are only a ruler in size, with octagonal edges, each side being only two inches. It imitates the famous Xinhai Road Protection Monument in Chengdu. The Sutra says that it was built in the eighth year of Xiantong and that the strokes are as fine as hair and are still very clear despite the erosion. The stupa is cleverly small and exquisite, resembling the Big Goose Pagoda in Xi'an. Both are suspected to be the works of famous masters. In addition, there are also some Yuan Dynasty cloud dot stone carvings, the larger ones being a foot in size, and the smaller ones about four or five inches. It was built in the fifteenth year of Zhizheng, and the production is also very exquisite.</p>
<p>After browsing, the reporter returned to Chengdu in the twilight with a feeling of joy and admiration. At the same time, he deeply felt that China is an ancient civilized country, but many of China's cultural relics and treasures have fallen into the hands of foreigners for collection and research. The Tang Dynasty was a prosperous era for the Chinese nation, but there are very few regulations and cultural relics handed down. Furthermore, after checking, the cultural relics discovered this time were all made during the time of Emperors Wenzong, Wuzong, and Yizong of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Wuzong was the number one enemy of Buddhism. In the fifth year of Huichang (845 AD), he ordered the destruction of Buddhist temples throughout the country and ordered monks and nuns to return to secular life. Buddhists called it the "Disaster of the Three Wu." Why were there Tibetan monks, temples, and such brilliant Buddhist objects during the time of Emperor Yizong? This is a question worthy of study by historians and archaeologists. The reporter deeply hopes that the discovery of this ancient treasure will arouse enthusiastic research interest in the long-silent Chinese academic community. In today's turbulent times, this may not be a cultural event. (Reporter Zhou Xueduan)</p>
<h3>### Alishan Forest Farm in Taiwan Province Plans to Develop Nanzi Xianxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] Alishan, known as the treasure house of forests in Taiwan Province, has seen a sharp decline in forest reserves in recent years due to large-scale logging. According to statistics, there are currently only more than 470,000 stone of timber left. Based on the existing timber collection equipment, it is estimated that all of it can be cut and transported within three years, ending the great business of the forest area in the past. The Alishan Forest Farm has planned to develop the virgin land of Nanzi Xianxi in Kaohsiung County. According to preliminary investigations, the Nanzi Xianxi forest area has a total area of 1,844 hectares, with a timber reserve of 1,435.134 stone, 398.967.272 cubic meters. At a felling rate of 140,000 stone per year, it can continue to be logged for ten years. Detailed plans have been drafted by relevant parties, mainly to extend the Alishan Forest Railway. Ten kilometers of new railway need to be built to enter the depths of the forest area and can be completely felled and transported. The engineering work will be carried out in two phases, and is expected to be completed within three years. The Alishan Forest Farm will organize a survey team to depart to Nanzi Xianxi for a detailed survey.</p>
<h3>### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Needs Vehicles Urgently, Bureau Plans to Improve Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 12th] Since the Hangrao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to traffic, there has been a shortage of vehicles. The 69 passenger cars and 369 freight cars urgently needed by the section have been repeatedly telegraphed to the Ministry of Communications for urgent allocation. However, except for a portion of the freight cars transported from Qingdao, the passenger cars have not yet been allocated, making it extremely difficult to serve passengers. The bureau has recently temporarily borrowed ten vehicles from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. If they can be allocated as planned, the passenger transport on this section will be further improved. Also, the bureau attaches great importance to the current traffic situation in Hangrao. Bureau Chief Hou Jiayuan has personally instructed Engineering Department Chief Qing Chengdao, Transportation Department Chief Du Xiang, and Deputy Chief of the Machinery Department Zhou Yuangu to travel from Hangzhou to Jinhua and then to various stations on the Qurao line to inspect operations and seek improvements.</p>
<h3>### One-Legged Thief Dares to Rob Watch Store in Changzhou's Bustling Downtown Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 14th] There have been many robberies in the eastern suburbs of this county recently. On the night of the 13th, at around 10:30 p.m., Zhenxingxiang Watch Store in Mishi River outside the West Gate was preparing to close when a person wearing a raincoat on the outside and a military uniform on the inside suddenly arrived. He was about 30 years old, with a northern accent, bald head, and long rectangular face. He held a Thompson submachine gun and charged straight in, immediately bolting the door and forcing the store employees into the back kitchen. He called out the person in charge of the store, Dai Wenbin, and forced him to hand over the keys to open the till. He then took 26 watches, 41 watch chains, and 100,000 yuan in cash, bundled them into a package, and forced them into the kitchen, locking the door before escaping with the loot. The store owner immediately telegraphed the robbery to the police bureau for arrest, but no results were obtained.</p>
<h3>### False Legislator Long Muxun's Sentence Changed to Five Years of Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Zibo Mining Area Survey: Fearful Rule with Novelty in Abundance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan Seventh Dispatch] Our reporter arrived in Zibo on the twelfth day after the National Army entered Zibo. However, everywhere, one could still see slogans, leaflets, and announcements left behind by the Communist bandits. Especially in Boshan, the Communist bandits even established a pseudo "Shandong Provincial Luzhong Public School" next to the Daliukeng Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory. The Fanguan Temple in the city had been used as a pseudo Party and government cadre training class. Shantou Village in the south of the city had once served as the office of the pseudo Shandong Provincial Government. Therefore, perhaps Boshan was the center of the Lu Communist political, economic, and cultural activities. As far as I could see, nearly half of the Communist bandits' slogans on the walls of the houses remained intact. At first, I was a little puzzled by this. After questioning many ordinary people from various angles, I learned that the Communist bandits had told them before retreating that they would return in two months for the "Fourth Liberation." Anyone who removed the slogans would be killed without question. Before retreating, the bandits also posted many large-scale announcements. Our reporter witnessed many such announcements in the Zibo area. Among them, the most shocking was the following: Emergency Announcement by the Luzhong Administrative Office (War Character No. 1)</p>
<p>Item 1: Landlords, Homecoming Corps, local bullies, secret agents, anyone who has one of the following facts will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>(1) Reporting village cadres to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, causing harm to their lives and property.</p>
<p>(2) Directly assassinating village cadres and emancipated peasants.</p>
<p>(3) Reporting public grain, military affairs, capital, or public property to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, resulting in losses.</p>
<p>(4) Reporting or directly stealing militia weapons and ammunition to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents.</p>
<p>(5) Coercing peasants to give up the fruits of struggle.</p>
<p>(6) Reporting the names of military workers to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, resulting in punishment.</p>
<p>(7) Leading the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents to rape civilian women.</p>
<p>(8) Leading the welcome of the Chiang Army, or the Chiang Army's offices requisitioning grain, money, and labor from the people.</p>
<p>(9) Smearing or destroying slogans, leaflets, or propaganda materials of the People's Liberation Army, democratic government, and mass organizations.</p>
<p>Item 2: Landlords, Homecoming Corps, local bullies, secret agents, those who have the following facts will be treated leniently.</p>
<p>(10) Those who genuinely repent of their past mistakes, no longer serve Chiang, and confess their sins to the democratic government and start anew.</p>
<p>This announcement.</p>
<p>Director: Ma Futang</p>
<p>Deputy Director: Cheng Zhaoxuan</p>
<p>July, 1947</p>
<p>Even welcoming the National Army or smearing slogans would be sentenced to capital punishment.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits completely relied on a policy of terror to maintain their cruel rule. This is evident from this. Not only that, but according to some ordinary people who have suffered under the Communist bandits, bullets are too precious for the Communist bandits and are not used easily. Therefore, for executions, they never adopted the method of shooting. Of course, on the other hand, this was precisely to strengthen the terror and make the people know what to fear. Therefore, their criminal laws were too numerous to list. In addition to the "stone stewed meat," etc., mentioned in the previous section, here are several more types as told by the ordinary people and as far as I can remember:</p>
<p>(1) Tank Team - Two giant stone rollers are framed with wood and dragged by cattle and horses, so that the person to be punished stands between the two rollers, moving on a rugged road until their legs are broken and their feet crushed.</p>
<p>(2) Looking at the "Chiang" Army from a Hundred-Foot Pole - The punishment method for leading the welcome of the National Army is to use a long pole to tie the person to be punished to the top of the pole. After the pole is erected, the rope is cut, and the person is smashed to death, called looking at the "Chiang" Army from a hundred-foot pole.</p>
<p>(3) Roasted Pig - The person to be punished is sealed in a jar and firewood is burned around it, called roasted pig.</p>
<p>(4) Repentance Soup - Pouring urine and feces on the head and face of the person to be punished until they "confess without hesitation" to the crimes added by the Communist bandits, called "Repentance Soup."</p>
<p>(5) Pulling the Electric Wire - The person to be punished is ordered to kneel on a six- or seven-layer or eight- or nine-layer high table. Someone ties a rope to the table leg in advance, and suddenly pulls the rope unexpectedly. The table falls, and the person is also smashed to death, called "Pulling the Electric Wire."</p>
<p>(6) Lighting the Sky Lantern - Pouring oil on the top of the head and setting it on fire, called "Lighting the Sky Lantern."</p>
<p>(7) Upside-Down Planting - Digging a pit about six feet deep, burying the person alive with their head down and their feet up, called upside-down planting.</p>
<p>(8) Artificial Fountain - Burying the lower body of the person to be punished in the soil, so the blood is naturally forced upwards. While they are crying out in pain, iron nails are hammered into their head and suddenly pulled out, so that hot blood spurts out, called "Artificial Fountain."</p>
<p>(9) Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind - Confining a person in a dark room and stabbing their abdomen with a needle is called metal, hitting them hard with a stick is called wood, hanging a person upside down and pouring chili water into their nostrils is called water, placing a person in a jar and roasting them with fire all around is called fire, burying them alive is called earth, and hanging a person naked from a hundred-foot high pole is called wind.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits used this kind of extremely inhuman harsh punishments to rule their "liberated areas." However, harsh punishments ultimately could not completely suppress the people's hearts that yearn for freedom. In many places, even before the National Army arrived, many people still went to welcome them secretly, regardless of everything. As soon as the National Army arrived, the national flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth was automatically hung at the door of every household. During the period of the Communist bandit occupation, they protected this national flag more than they protected their lives. When the National Army needed to requisition laborers and grain, they were able to donate and transport them enthusiastically. Due to the lessons of the three advances and three retreats in the Zibo area in the past, their only hope for the National Army is that they will not retreat again in the future; otherwise, they will be subjected to deeper trampling and revenge by the Communist bandits. A few days ago, a rumor spread that the National Army was about to retreat again, and the suffering people did not know what to do. Finally, they were forced to guard the city gate by common consent, preparing to retreat with the National Army at the same time. In their minds, there were sentries of the National Army at the city gate. If the National Army really retreated, they could leave with the sentries. Later, more and more people gathered. After a senior officer of the National Army explained that it was a "change of guard" and not a "retreat," the ordinary people dispersed one after another. This proves that under the Communist bandits' rule of terror, the people's hearts still tend towards the government. The only question is how the government should win over the hearts of these people who have been trampled upon by the Communist bandits. This is by no means limited to passive relief and comfort, which can solve the problem. What is especially important is how to actively train them and lead them, "using organization against organization" and "using force against force," so that they can return to their hometowns armed, live and work in peace, and not let the people feel threatened in any way of their survival again.

<h3>Chengdu Leshan Hall Leader Creates False Rumors of a Sichuan Flood Demon, Fooling People to Jump into Water, One Dead and Four Revived</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu Thirteenth Dispatch] A shocking case of spreading rumors to confuse the public has been cracked near Chengdu. Zhang, the leader of Leshan Hall in Wangmiao Street, outside Lvrong Dong, often wears Bagua clothing, gathers his followers, spreads rumors, deceives people, and extorts money. He has many believers. Nearby, there is the Xihe Weaving Factory, where hundreds of workers are half-bewitched by the cult. On the 28th of last month, Zhang said to the public: "The recent floods in western Sichuan are caused by the gods using floods to save those with predestined relationships. Those who aspire to become immortals can go to the Fulong Temple in Guanxian to jump into the water and dissolve their corpses, and they will immediately attain immortality and enjoy the pleasures of the Dragon Palace forever." Five people, including female worker Bao Gu and male workers Zhang Zhijun and Du Gaolin, believed this to be true. On the 31st, they took a bus to Guanxian together. Near the Suojiang Bridge in Dujiangyan, they calmly jumped into the water and drifted away with the waves. People on the shore witnessed this scene and were horrified, but because the waves were turbulent and the current was rapid, they could not rescue them in time. Fortunately, the five people were swept to Jintong when three of them were bravely rescued by the weir workers. Except for Zhang Zhijun, who had drowned, two people were resuscitated on the spot. The next day, the Guanxian County Government sent staff to take care of them and inquired about the original plan. They urgently telegraphed the provincial government, and the Rong security authorities arrested the evil man. The cult leader had already escaped after hearing the news. The municipal government has now disbanded and sealed the Hall of Goodness. Zhang is being pursued.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Orders the Requisition and Loan of Military Grain, with Good Responses from Various Counties and Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin Fifteenth Dispatch] This county received a provincial order to requisition and borrow 45,200 shi of military grain and paddy, with half of it to be collected by September 20 and the full amount to be collected by October 5 for allocation. As the new grain has not yet entered the market and it is the time of year where one crop is depleted and another not yet harvested, it is difficult to borrow such a large amount of rice. For this matter, the county government specially convened local party groups and various industries to hold meetings and negotiate continuously for two days. After detailed exploration, the result was to use the method of dividing the whole into parts. Various industries separately recognized and borrowed 1,000 to 2,000 shi each. The total amount of 32,500 shi was recognized by the grain and wood industries. The rest was purchased by industries that were not assigned. As for grain purchase loans, major manufacturers negotiated with various banks to determine that the National Bank would borrow 1.5 billion yuan, and commercial banks would borrow 500 million yuan. The conditions were to use the warehouse receipts of major manufacturers as collateral, and the procedures were simplified as much as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin Fifteenth Dispatch] The county government convened an emergency meeting of various agencies on the 13th to discuss the provincial order for advance borrowing of land tax. It was decided that: (1) The county chamber of commerce will be responsible for allocating and borrowing 3,000 shi of tax grain. (2) The remaining 17,000 shi will be allocated and borrowed by the Land and Grain Office according to the proportion of land tax in each district, township, and town. (3) The 4,200 shi of outstanding tax grain have been sold by the county government. How to raise funds will be determined by including this quota in the quota of township borrowing. If any household delays, they will be punished for delaying military grain.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yixing Fourteenth Dispatch] This county has a large number of outstanding land taxes for the 35th year. In order to increase administrative efficiency and enrich work efficiency, County Magistrate Li specially assigned the collection of outstanding taxes to a task force. The district heads of each district were appointed as team leaders and collaborated with the commissioners appointed by the county government. They were required to pay all the money within ten days and set rewards and punishments to supervise the collection.</p>

The request for work-for-relief funds has now been changed to 10 billion yuan, intending to take the opportunity to connect ponds and dredge rivers.

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Higher Education in the Northeast, Shenyang Schools Express Their Opinions, Chen Cheng Hopes That Famous Professors Inside the Pass Will Go to the Northeast to Assist</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang Sixteenth Dispatch] Today, the issue of higher education in the Northeast was conceptualized at a symposium of the Northeast education community called by Chen Cheng on the 15th (see the first page of yesterday's newspaper). Liu Shusheng, the acting president of Northeast University, said that security and price fluctuations have been greater in recent years, and that professors coming to the Northeast symbolize stability. Yu Xiezong, the acting president of Zhongzheng University, said that the Northeast was occupied for 14 years, and education must be started from scratch. Due to traffic and political relations, it is difficult to hire more professors. In addition, the lives of students should be stabilized to prevent them from acting rashly. Luo Yunping, the director of general affairs of Northeast University, said that the Northeast should pay special attention to education because it has national defense significance, but there is a lack of books and instruments, and professors have a hard life, which makes it difficult to achieve the above goals. Professors at Shenyang Medical College asked to solve the problem of winter coal use and the remittance of funds back home by Japanese professors and the remittance of funds inside the pass by Chinese professors. Fang Yongzheng, the president of the Weibai Normal College, said that the youth of the Northeast need education, have a high desire for knowledge, and are easy to teach. Professor Liu Gongyun said that the Japanese paid attention to practical science and hoped that this advantage would not be erased. He also hoped that the funds from punishing the hoarding, corruption, and extravagance would be used to run education. Wang Shulin, the dean of Zhongzheng University, said that the lives of professors are not as good as those of rich people's dogs, and the poor people are even worse. He also hoped that all parties would withdraw from schools. Chen Cheng hoped that everyone would recognize the security of the Northeast, engage in psychological construction, and hoped that famous professors inside the pass would not regard the Northeast as a dangerous place and would come north to assist the government in building education in the Northeast.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Jewish School Implements New Education Plan Emphasizing Hands-On Training</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish School will implement a new education plan this fall. This plan has already achieved remarkable success abroad, and this is its first introduction to Shanghai. In the past, critics of today's education system have often said that our schools rely too much on books and fail to instill practical knowledge in children, leaving them ill-prepared to cope with the hardships of life.</p>
<p>Since the educational reforms of Froebel, Montessori, and others, primary and secondary schools have increasingly emphasized "hands-on" training. After World War I, most experimental schools in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the United Kingdom, the United States added vocational training classes to their curricula.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish School will implement a similar plan this semester, adding compulsory sewing and woodworking courses in addition to the existing curriculum. The aim is not only to develop manual skills but also to provide students with complete vocational training, so that after leaving school, they will have skills to earn a living. The original intention of this vocational training is to encourage Jews to learn various crafts. Under Hitler's tyranny, many Jewish doctors, lawyers, and university professors who were expelled from their countries and roamed other lands found it difficult to make a living. However, some who had received vocational training were able to work as locksmiths, radio experts, or plumbers to support themselves. Many successful Jewish immigrants in this city have received such vocational training. In the future, Jewish schoolchildren in this city will also receive this kind of training.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Foreign Trade Conference Speeches and Proposal Reviews Zhang Jia'ao Speaks on Foreign Exchange Policy and the New Mission of Trade The General Assembly Will Continue Today and Is Scheduled to Close This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Foreign Trade Conference continued at the City Chamber of Commerce at 10 AM yesterday, with more than 100 representatives attending, chaired by Huang Zaisou. According to the original schedule, President Zhang Jia'ao of the Central Bank was to deliver a speech entitled "China's New Foreign Exchange Policy and the New Mission of Import and Export Trade." However, because Mr. Zhang had to go to Guangzhou on official business, Director Li of the Quota Allocation Office delivered the speech on his behalf. The main points were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Before the war, China's trade deficit was compensated by remittances from overseas Chinese, foreign investment, and silver exports. However, the eight-year war of resistance damaged the country's economic vitality, and the frequent Communist disturbances left no time for recovery, leading to the current difficult situation.</p>
<p>(2) The new regulations for the management of foreign exchange promulgated on August 16 are a relatively reasonable measure. After the implementation of this new policy, the legal tender prices of imported goods will not fall excessively, and excessive profits will not accrue to importers, and domestic similar products will not be threatened. The export prices can gradually balance with other domestic prices, so as to encourage exports and promote production.</p>
<p>(3) It is believed that after the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, the foreign exchange market can be expected to stabilize.</p>
<p>(4) The control of import trade is not a government policy that tends to control, but is out of necessity. Otherwise, the expenditure of foreign exchange will be impossible to estimate, and hoarding will be impossible to prevent.</p>
<p>(5) The qualification review for importer registration will be based on the turnover in 1946, and the registration review standards will be slightly expanded. In addition, those who have the qualification to exclusively operate famous foreign manufacturers will also be allowed to register. Factories that directly import raw materials for their own use before and after the war, even if the quantity is not large, can also obtain registration qualifications.</p>
<p>(6) The ultimate benefit of imported materials should belong to the consumer from the national standpoint. Whether factories or importers, they are both in the position of transferors and should be satisfied with legal profits.</p>
<p>(7) It is hoped that domestic products will reduce costs and improve quality, and that operators will develop great vision and a spirit of cooperation to facilitate exports.</p>
<p>Declaring a Stand, Emotions Aroused</p>
<p>After Li Gan finished reading, he hurriedly left. The original schedule was for Zhao Dihua to deliver a speech on "Economic Construction and International Financial Institutions." However, because Mr. Zhao was in Beijing, the speech was also read by the conference secretary on his behalf. It elaborated on the basic understanding of international lending and the structure and operation of international banks.</p>
<p>At this time, the atmosphere at the venue felt rather dull. The climax of the morning meeting was the discussion of the Legislative Yuan's request to dissolve and reorganize the National Federation of Commerce. Emotions ran high for a time, and the language was sharp. As a result, it was decided to hold a joint meeting of representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities at the Jin Gu Hotel tonight to unanimously declare their position on this matter.</p>
<p>At noon, the National Shipping Association hosted a banquet for all the representatives at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, advocating the maintenance of the national shipping industry and the development of foreign trade, believing that the shipping industry is a "subsidiary industry" to commerce and has an inseparable relationship with the prosperity of the national economy. The income from intangible export trade can also compensate for the difference in the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>Yang Guanbei and Xu Xueyu spoke in succession, both believing that the export industry and the shipping industry are closely related. The United Kingdom has spent a lot of effort to protect its shipping industry, in terms of civil law and government cooperation, which is worthy of our country's example.</p>
<p>Group Meetings to Review Proposals</p>
<p>Group meetings were held from 2 PM, dividing into five groups: export, import, foreign exchange, transportation insurance, and special groups, to review proposals, totaling more than 90 items. The discussion was very heated, especially in the export and import groups, until about 6 PM, when they all came to an end. After the various proposals were revised and summarized, they will be submitted to the general assembly today for approval.</p>
<p>At 7 PM, the Banking Association, the Silver and Money Industry Association, the Insurance Industry Association, and the Trust Industry Association hosted all the representatives. Xu Guomao delivered a speech, saying that the current deposits of commercial banks are only about one trillion yuan, and most of them are short-term deposits, which is equivalent to less than 25 million yuan before the war, which is really not enough to meet the needs of legitimate industry and commerce. It is hoped that the country's future financial policy can be coordinated with the effort to increase production.</p>
<p>Shen Rixin delivered a speech on behalf of the Silver and Money Industry Association, saying that it is rumored that the policy will import tobacco raw materials from the United States, which can be used domestically for three years. If this news is true, it will be detrimental to domestic agricultural production, and it is hoped that the representatives attending the meeting will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ningxia representative Qiao Senrong delivered a reply speech. In addition to expressing gratitude for the hospitality, he asked those present to pay attention to the symptoms of the Northwest wool cargo being abandoned on the ground, and hoped that the industrial circles of this city could invest in the Northwest and set up factories. It was not until about 8 PM that everyone dispersed with pleasure.</p>
<p>Speeches by Foreign Guests at Today's General Assembly</p>
<p>The plenary session will continue at 9 AM this morning, and Mr. John, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, has been specially invited to speak on "The Problems of Import and Export Trade in China at the Present Stage." Dr. Yang Ge, Consultant of the Central Bank, will speak on "The Expansion of China's Export Trade." Ms. Zhang Xiaomei will speak on "The Balance of International Payments in Our Country." In the afternoon, the group review reports will be discussed, and the general assembly declaration will be passed. The general assembly is scheduled to close today.</p>
<h3>British Exchange Rate Lowered</h3>

<h3>Tight Money Market Continues to Hamper the Decline of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday, due to the excessive congestion of off-market deliveries, experienced difficulties, and the interest rate was forced to rise to 2 jiao 1 and 2 jiao 5 and a half fen, which was extremely unfavorable in the middle. However, when the salary was paid by Fangjian the day before, because the large bills were insufficient, the 1 million yuan check from the China Bank Trust Department was used instead, and it was actually associated with a huge amount of bank notes. The people's hearts were still fluctuating, and there was still some improvement after the decline. In the end, due to the continued tight money market, the afternoon trading still felt completely inflexible.</p>
<p>Early Morning</p>
<p>High prices were seen due to the 2,000 yuan contraction in the British exchange rate and the mystery of the parallel line notes, but this kind of psychological opening was dispelled. After Yongsha opened, it stepped down to 237 yuan and 240 yuan due to the departure of No. 65 and others. No. 117 and No. 134 still entered, and once pulled Yongsha up to 244 yuan. After entering, it was affected by the inability to deliver goods off-market and the substantial increase in interest rates. No. 104 and others vigorously dumped Yongsha, and No. 223 and others sold Deyongsha one after another, and stepped down to low prices of 233 yuan and 237 yuan. It was supported after No. 218 and others replenished it. No. 157 and others also entered the current Yongsha, and some of those who were confused by the banknote rumors made some compensation. Near noon, Yongsha once rebounded to a price of 238 yuan and 243 yuan, and then closed at a price of 237 yuan and 242 yuan. After closing, the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yonggong, Zhongfa, and half of the spot stocks fell, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing slightly fell, Xinhua, Xinhe, and Jinglun remained flat, Meiya, Liannei, and Neiyi slightly rose, and Zhabei, Rongfeng, Zhongsi, Match, and Xinya slightly fell. Hua Feng and Yongsha were flat for deferred delivery, and Xinguang, Xinhe, Meiya, and Jingfu slightly decreased.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>A little stability was seen at the opening of the session. After the opening of Deyongsha, No. 23 and others successively closed from 244 yuan. Retail investors and the surface vigorously suppressed it, and stepped down to low prices of 234 yuan and 236 yuan. No. 97 and others still paid it, and rose to 239 yuan. However, the money market was still tight after the National Bank's exchange difference, and No. 32 still had a conclusion. Yongye was lowered by No. 191 to the limit down, and then retreated to 236 yuan. Under the maintenance of No. 76 and No. 116, Yongsha closed at 236 yuan and 238 yuan. The asking price after closing was tired. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yongsha, Xinhe, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, Zhabei, Zhongsi, Jinglun, and Anhui fell, Yonggong and Zhongfa slightly rose, Yongye fell to the limit, and Xinya, Xinguang, and Huafeng were still flat. For deferred delivery, Yongsha, Xinhe, Yanya, Xinguang, and Jingfu slightly fell, and Huafeng was still flat. The old stocks Dasheng and Cultural stocks continued to decline off-market, and the rest were still stable.</p>
<h3>National Bank Enters, Tight Money Market</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Bank Bureau continued to enter 30.9 billion yuan in the bill exchange yesterday, and also entered 51.2 billion yuan on Monday, so the money market was tight again, and the dark interest rate was called up to 1 jiao 9 fen, and the off-market interest rate for Chinese stocks was also raised to 2 jiao 5 and a half fen. Yesterday, the Central Bank entered 31.1 billion yuan, the direct exchange line Zhuang entered 13 billion yuan, the foreign bank entered 15.2 billion yuan, and the agent exchange line Zhuang entered 59.1 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank Handles Current Deposits</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to facilitate the use of funds by commercial banks, the Central Bank has specially set up interbank time deposits in addition to interbank current deposits for regulation. The regulations stipulate that 500 million yuan is a unit, with a period of 10 days, and the interest rate is 5%, which is higher than that of current deposits. In addition, if the deposit line Zhuang needs funds within the period, it can still add 2 fen to the deposit and mortgage it to the National Bank. Therefore, commercial line Zhuang is convenient. It is heard that since August 20, there has been a very enthusiastic rush to the National Bank to handle this deposit, with a total amount of more than 100 billion yuan, which is beneficial to absorbing market funds and stabilizing prices. In addition, it is also heard that in addition to commercial banks, national bank bureaus that have not applied to the National Bank for re-mortgage or discounted payments can also obtain the convenience of interbank time deposits.</p>
<h3>Loan Committee Approves Industrial Loan of 4 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 23rd regular meeting of the Discount Committee of the Central Bank was held at 4 PM on September 16 in the conference room of the committee. Members such as Qin Runqing and others attended, chaired by Qin Runxiang. The meeting approved 14 industrial loan cases reviewed by the 23rd Industrial Review Committee, with a total amount of 4.04 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Market Price of Gauze: Adopting a System of Rewarding Secret Reports; the Quota for Gauze Transported South Increased by Fifty Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee's eleventh committee meeting was held yesterday, starting at 4:00 PM. Resolutions: (1) Recently, the market price of gauze has seen a significant rise, raising concerns that unscrupulous merchants are accumulating and manipulating prices. To strengthen control, a system of rewarding secret reports will be adopted. If non-industry individuals are found to be dealing in gauze, or industry insiders are confirmed to be hoarding and manipulating prices, the gauze will be recovered at the previously agreed price. Those who provide secret reports will be rewarded. This measure is expected to be submitted for discussion at the next Municipal Government Economic Conference and then implemented by the committee's gauze group.</p>
<p>(2) To thoroughly suppress the rising price of cotton, a survey will be conducted of the latest cotton stock levels of various cotton firms and yarn factories in the city, to facilitate control.</p>
<p>(3) The quantity of gauze transported south will be increased by fifty percent from this month onwards, based on the original quantity. The control of gauze transported north will be completely lifted after the committee's Tianjin office is established.</p>
<p>(4) The agreed price for cotton yarn will be based on the original agreement, adopting a flexible approach to stabilize market prices.</p>
<h3>Gauze Market Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw prices decline due to ample supply and continued tightness in the money market. There was considerable reselling of cotton cloth within the market, with many manufacturers selling off their stock. Supply exceeded demand, also leading to a market decline.</p>
<h3>Immediate Use of Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>Banking Industry Requests Temporary Maintenance of Existing Practices</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Banking and Commercial Association resolved yesterday: (1) Regarding the immediate use of negotiable instruments, a further submission will be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the existing practices be temporarily maintained. (2) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's imposition of a special business tax of four percent, a request will be submitted for a reduction. (3) The issue of liability for returned checks following a colleague's suspension from clearing should be definitively resolved; it was decided to conduct further careful study.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weaken, Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Government bonds weakened further yesterday. Retail absorption was unable to curb the selling pressure. Rooms 503 and 555 both sold, with turnover remaining at just over three million. Unified Series C opened at 12,300 yuan, then gradually fell to 10,500 yuan before slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Series A and B fell by 900 yuan, Series C fell by 1,200 yuan alone, Series D fell by 800 yuan, and Series E fell slightly by 500 yuan.</p>
<p>There was not much change in foreign stocks yesterday. Supply and demand were mixed among securities firms, and individual stocks saw varied rises and falls. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric reached 12.3 yuan, but did not make significant progress. As a result, compared to the previous close, Hall &amp; Holtz, Wing On, and Jardine Matheson saw slight declines, while British American Tobacco, Jardine, and Shipping saw small gains; other stocks were relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Korea Urge Opening of Trade with Korea</h3>
<p>Zhou Shenjiu, Chairman of the China-Korea Trade Association, and others recently jointly telegraphed Liu Weichang, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Dai, Acting Minister of the Overseas Department, urging the abolition of the ban on trade with Korea and the early restoration of normal relations, and proposed two suggestions for temporary commercial arrangements.</p>
<h3>Rayon Soars</h3>
<p>The momentum of rayon remains strong, and prices continue to rise. Yesterday, the market rose sharply again by 1.7 million yuan compared to the previous day. 120 miscellaneous brands of bright rayon opened at 32 million yuan, reaching a maximum of 4 million yuan, and finally retreated to 3.3 million yuan. Eastern Sea afternoon trading in 4.5 million yuan, the results of doing 3.8 million yuan, 150 Golden Three Horses bright, yesterday's price was around 36 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Restores Free Trade; Market Transactions Flat</h3>
<p>The oil market resumed free trade yesterday, but market transactions were extremely quiet, with a downward trend. Soybean oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and bulk raw oil was stable and weak. Barrel raw oil fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, clear oil was stable and fair, vegetable oil softened, and sesame oil also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil Merchants Association Representatives to Visit the Mayor Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Edible Oil Commercial Association held a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Zhang Chao. Zhang Chao first reported on a discussion with the Mayor regarding the proposed resumption of edible oil rationing. However, due to the significant implications of this matter, after discussion, it was decided that Zhang Chao would visit Mayor Wu at 3:00 PM today to seek solutions to the following points: (1) What name should be used for the resumed rationing? (2) What is the source of funding for the organization? (3) Which organization will supply the edible oil required for rationing? (4) Personnel arrangements, etc., must be decided before actively proceeding with the resumption of rationing.</p>
<p>Retailers Reluctant; Rice Market Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 12,700 piculs of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Retailers showed reluctance to stock up, mainly due to the high prices, making sales difficult. Many retailers were selling off their stock, causing the market to shift from firm to weak. Indica and japonica rice both saw declines ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, while early thin indica remained stable due to scarcity. The rationing of flour remained unchanged, and market activity was also relatively quiet, with no price fluctuations. Bran became highly sought after in Fujian, soaring to new heights, rising by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan and breaking the 100,000 yuan mark. Soybean cake saw activity in Shantou and Taiwan, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yellow beans were mutually absorbed by local and out-of-town traders, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai is Not an Easy Place to Establish Oneself: Reply to an Apprentice Seeking a Living in Shanghai - 효生君</h3>
<p>효生君: After reading your long letter, we are very moved. There are indeed too many unreasonable things in the current society. There is a considerable number of young people in situations like yours. Your father's "emphasis on commerce and disregard for learning" in hastily deciding your future is indeed an unreasonable thing. It is naturally good that you have a strong desire for knowledge, and we express our admiration for your determination to continue your studies in order to achieve your future goals.</p>
<p>However, you should make a thorough consideration and a comprehensive plan beforehand. Your disregard for everything in coming to Shanghai is of course a courage that a young person should have, but this rash behavior often commits the mistake of "having courage but lacking strategy," which causes the entire plan to suffer setbacks.</p>
<p>Although there are many schools in Shanghai, tuition fees are set very high, and poor young people without money cannot enter. Things like "scholarships" and "loan scholarships" require excellent grade reports or certificates of guarantee in order to apply. Finding a job in Shanghai, where there is a surplus of people, is also a very difficult thing. You must wait patiently to obtain a suitable opportunity.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Shanghai is very high, and it is difficult to live without a fixed income. In our opinion, it is better to return to your home in Changshu, explain your aspirations to your father, and if he is a truly loving father, he will certainly understand you. Good luck! ·Editor· (Letter published in the 15th edition of this column)</p>

<h3>Bombing and Other Matters</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Japanese goods are of "poor quality," many Chinese manufacturers may "breathe a sigh of relief," believing that Japanese goods are not to be feared. In reality, Japanese goods have low costs. With their existing industrial base, and under the supervision of the American military, they will certainly be able to catch up to pre-war standards.</p>
<p>What about our products? Chinese manufacturers must consider this.</p>
<p>"A dancer pregnant and meeting the mayor" – this is naturally an extremely tragic thing. However, at the dancer's conference, the dancers only cried and said that there was only "one way to die," which is truly discouraging.</p>
<p>At this dancer's conference, the workers said a lot and proposed many solutions. Why didn't the dancers themselves say a few more words?</p>
<p>After "Frisbee," there is another "strange story" of "bombing London." In reality, at this time, these people hearing the "latest" in war news are being too hasty. Honestly, no one will provoke war at the moment. Humanity's nerves have not yet recovered from six or seven years of "destruction" and "death," let alone anything else!</p>
<p>The admissions lists for various universities have been successively announced. The whereabouts of those who failed are worth pondering.</p>
<p>I wonder if the education authorities have any investigations or statistics on them?</p>
<p>Hu Shi made a statement to our newspaper's reporter, advocating for increasing the number of national universities. We completely agree; however, there are too many illiterate people in China. Running universities well is indeed reasonable, but eradicating illiteracy should be carried out more widely. What does Dr. Hu Shi think?</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>China and Siam</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Ming</p>
<p>The main problem of Siam is the conflict between the strong desire of the people of the country for autonomy and the European colonial powers who insist on guiding the fate of "backward" people and still try to maintain their pre-war position, making Siam a land where this conflict will continue indefinitely. But today, in Southeast Asia, Siam is the only country trying to break free from the shackles of foreign colonialism, which gives travelers who are familiar with Siam's situation a pleasant contrast.</p>
<p>However, this small kingdom also has its own post-war problems. Although Siam is formally independent, it is still subject to a certain degree of control by several major powers. For example, most of its foreign trade is now in the hands of the British. It is said that about 80 percent of its coal industry is controlled by British and Australian interests, while the major part of various other businesses in the country is also held in the hands of Chinese merchants. Siam's border disputes have never been resolved in a way that could satisfy Siam's demands, and have now led to strained relations with the French in Vietnam. When France had restored all the land claimed by Vietnam, the French accused the Siamese of supplying weapons to the Viet Minh government and facilitating their smuggling across the Vietnamese border.</p>
<p>Post-war inflation, a decrease in foreign exchange reserves, a lack of important foreign investment, and the government's apparent inefficiency have created many difficulties for the country. However, Siam's biggest simple problem is that the small number of Chinese expatriates may one day become a majority.</p>
<p>Before Japan's surrender, China and Siam had formal diplomatic relations. Siam was not very willing to have such diplomatic relations in the past, because she was afraid that a Chinese ambassador would inevitably become the official representative of an estimated three million to four million overseas Chinese in Siam. This number of three to four million overseas Chinese, which may account for one-fifth of Siam's total population, has always created a sharp minority problem. After the victory over Japan, China emerged as one of the victorious five powers, and Siam had no choice but to establish diplomatic relations with China. Bangkok and Nanjing exchanged ambassadors, while the Siamese government relied on various laws to restrict China's activities within its territory. Except for a certain riot in 1945, relations between the two countries were at least superficially calm and peaceful.</p>
<p>Due to their hard work and outstanding abilities, the overseas Chinese in Siam have occupied a dominant position in Siam's economy. Siamese people are generally farmers and rulers, while all trade and commerce are actually in the hands of the Chinese. Because the Chinese are becoming increasingly wealthy, Siamese farmers and workers are increasingly blaming the Chinese "middlemen" for the economic oppression and other difficulties they suffer. At the same time, the overseas Chinese feel that they are often publicly attacked, and naturally tend to seek protection from their motherland and demand more guarantees and privileges from Siam. It is clear that this situation is explosive. Only careful and moderate consideration of all issues by both parties can guarantee that the people of the two countries can live together peacefully side by side. (Translated from the Miller's Review)</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Oil</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>Pessimistic prophets are always saying that the world, especially the United States, is running out of oil. Recent developments, however, indicate that this fear is entirely "anxiety about the sky falling." First, before current reserves are exhausted, atomic energy will have already reduced the need for oil. Second, new factories established by the United States in Texas and Kansas will soon be able to produce millions of barrels of gasoline annually from underground "natural gas," and at a price that is as cheap as the gasoline that is now refined from petroleum. Third, "Mobil Company" of New Jersey has entered into a cooperative plan with the world's largest coal company – "Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company" – to engage in large-scale research and experiments in order to obtain an economically viable method of making gasoline from coal. Fourth, the world's first-class geologists have predicted that vast and boundless oil fields can be found in the shallow seas around the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Philippines (such as north of Kyushu Island in Japan). To date, these sources of oil near the land have hardly been touched. In the United States, only California and Louisiana have drilled for oil in the nearby seas. In fact, the oil reserves on the seabed are immeasurably larger than those on land; and with the progress of science and technology, the date of large-scale formal exploitation of them is not far away.</p>
<h3>From Shanghai to Japan</h3>
<p>— Wu Huaqing</p>
<p>——One of the Records of a Trip to America</p>
<p>On the morning of August 24th, many cars, boxes, and people of all ages and genders gathered at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf. These people and goods were all preparing to enter the white General Gordon steamer that was docked at the pier.</p>
<p>The ship was scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM. The pier was crowded with people seeing off the passengers. As soon as the ship left the shore, they surged onto the floating deck like a tide, waving handkerchiefs, grass mats, or umbrellas, and inspired by the music from the loudspeaker, almost wanted to jump into the water to see them off. A Jewish group was seeing off their friend, holding up a large banner that said Bon Voyage and waving small blue and white flags. After the ship sailed, some of them jumped onto a small motorboat and chased after it, singing their Jewish cheer for a long time before returning. After the ship passed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, the plant set off firecrackers to bid farewell to their colleagues who were going abroad.</p>
<p>The first night, a movie was shown on deck. Because I was extremely tired from the past few days, I fell asleep as soon as I hit the bed, regardless of whether the cabin was hot or not.</p>
<p>Among the passengers this time, more than 250 were self-funded students going abroad, and according to regulations, they all sat in third class, so they formed their own tribe. In addition to eating and sleeping, they could also enjoy the deck and lounge, so they also found it quite convenient and comfortable. On the evening of the 25th, the students held a plenary meeting, and statistics were taken on the distribution of each school. As a result, the largest number went to the University of Michigan. Everyone agreed that each school should be divided into small groups, and they could travel together after going ashore in San Francisco. In addition, a person in charge was elected to prepare for various activities such as doing plays, singing, giving speeches, dancing, playing bridge, and photography. In this way, they would naturally no longer feel lonely on this trip.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, the ship sailed into the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. The mountains and ridges along the coast undulated, and there were scattered sailboats. At around 9:00 AM, it sailed into Kobe Harbor. The harbor has a semicircular long dike, with two lighthouses standing at each dike entrance. After entering the harbor, the loudspeaker immediately announced that photography was prohibited because Japan was under military control. The harbor project in Kobe was built on a considerable scale, extending out into the harbor surface in the shape of wolf teeth, increasing the length of the berths. All passengers were prohibited from going ashore, but seeing the tall buildings standing far away and the iron chimneys emitting black smoke, I couldn't help but feel infinite emotion. The wharf was entirely controlled by the US military. The loading and unloading of iron ladders used jeep cranes, and even correcting the position of the ladders was done with small jeeps, making the most of mechanization. The Japanese, seeing this, may not be able to resist being impressed. The ship set sail again at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>August 26th evening, in the lounge of the General Gordon Steamer</p>
<p>Note: "Spring and Autumn" will be temporarily suspended for one day today.</p>
<h3>A Medley of Things in America</h3>
<p>— Xu Ziyuan</p>
<p>Child Labor in America</p>
<p>We can assert categorically that there are no useless people in America. Even the old, weak, and disabled have special jobs to do. Munitions factories employ many blind people to work. They lead their police dogs from home to the factory. Blind people in China have no work to do and can only call out "Lady and Madam" on the side of the road. We have learned half a bottle of cool "humanism" from Europe and America to oppose child labor, but America is a genuine humanistic country that does not prohibit child labor with harsh laws. As long as the employer does not mistreat the child laborer, and the working hours and nature do not hinder the child's development, why should we, under the guise of "humanitarianism," cut off the child laborer's livelihood? There are many jobs in America suitable for children. One of them is delivering newspapers. Millions of children ride their bicycles to deliver newspapers before going to school every morning. Each newspaper is counted at five cents. The newspaper office gets three cents, and the newsboy gets two cents. Delivering fifty copies a day can earn one US dollar. The work takes no more than half an hour every morning, and it is convenient to deliver newspapers from home by bicycle to school without any trouble. The newspapers are delivered to the newsboy's home by the newspaper office's car. When it is time to harvest cotton and oranges, farmers publish large advertisements to recruit students to help pick cotton and oranges. In addition to providing food and lodging, they can earn US$7-8 per day. The government encourages "child labor service," which can at least free up adults to take on other more important jobs. If there were no child labor, a large part of the adult population would be forced to move from factories to rural villages, which would affect the output of the factories. The child labor system can cultivate children's independent spirit of self-reliance. American parents never give children pocket money. They rely entirely on their own efforts. Older children are employed in coffee shops as waiters and cleaners, and some are hired in homes to care for babies. All of this is based on the principle that it does not hinder their studies. Shining shoes is also a child's profession. It would be a waste of manpower to have adults do this kind of easy work. Americans never use children's labor to do work for nothing in the name of charity. Therefore, any campaigns to promote children to sell "paralysis disease stamps," "Aid China Movement paper flowers," and "anti-tuberculosis movement paper flowers" have material rewards. American customs are that obligations and rights go hand in hand. A father asks his son to polish his leather shoes and gives him a dime as an example. The son receives it without shame and expresses his thanks. In Chinese families, children do not take on household chores, but demand candy from their parents, as if it is a matter of course. This is indulgence and leniency. How can this be the way to educate children? American children usually set aside a percentage of their earnings during work periods to be managed by their parents to offset food and lodging expenses. In fact, the parents use it to buy them clothes and daily necessities. This not only cultivates children's responsibility, but also restrains their extravagance. Chinese children inherit their parents' wealth from an early age and do not know the difficulty of material resources. Therefore, profligate sons have become an Eastern specialty. Americans do not give inheritances to their children and grandchildren, so there is no family to ruin and no property to squander. (51)</p>
<p>Stubborn Cat A-Mi (29) by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Green Jade Table</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>——The people of Rongqing County cast and erected a stele for County Magistrate Meng.</p>
<p>Strong nations have made corruption a trend, how could it be only one county official? I hate the people erecting a stele, raising stones and crying out for injustice, dipping my brush in bloody filth, it is difficult to cleanse for eternity!</p>
<p>If we search out corrupt officials and inscribe the history of greed, countless "stele forests" could be counted! Moreover, turning a traitor into a virtuous official is easy—writing a longevity article in private, weeping in a tombstone epitaph, there will be talented people to mimic it!</p>
<p>Note: "Stele Forest" is the name of the place in Xi'an where steles are stored, named for the many steles. All the words in the last three sentences are words of flattery, especially after death, everything is to blame others.</p>
<p>Profiles</p>
<h3>Seeking Justice for the Memory of He Yangling</h3>
<p>— A Lament</p>
<p>"Jiang Jingguo of Southern Jiangxi, He Yangling of Western Zhejiang," were like comets in the political landscape of the Southeast during the War of Resistance. Who would have thought that the latter star would fall so soon!</p>
<p>Both men's political capabilities were strongly supported by higher authorities. One created a new atmosphere in the administrative circles of the rear, while the other struggled to maintain the most arduous situation in the later stages of the War of Resistance at the front.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Mr. He Yangling began in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. At that time, Shaoxing had just fallen, and the people across the narrow strip of water were in a state of extreme panic. Although it was the end of the lunar year, families, both large and small, were already fleeing to the countryside for refuge. The roads were almost deserted, and at night, only a few street lamps cast a faint glow. He was the administrative commissioner of the Third District, and his office was located at the foot of Wolong Mountain in the urban area. In his small office, I discussed with him strategies for Shaoxing's self-defense. At that time, he had already established the Third District Political Work Team, calling upon the youth of Yue [Shaoxing] to rise up in resistance. The district political work team held two sessions, and during the political warfare against the Japanese puppets, a large group of young men and women shed a great deal of blood and sweat in Chayuan Town, in the coastal area.</p>
<p>Mr. He was very strict with himself. On New Year's Day of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], as Shaoxing society gradually deteriorated from stability, he wrote an article titled "My Ten Self-Admonishments," published in the local newspaper, to encourage himself and others. The song "Defend Greater Shaoxing" was also written by him, and he commissioned someone to compose the music. At that time, soldiers and civilians in the Third District, on the streets and in the alleys, would sing the song: "The devils are coming, the devils are coming, sons and daughters of Yue, quickly stand at the outpost of the Qiantang River..."</p>
<p>Mr. He came from a literary background. Even during the busy times of military and political affairs, he would still paint and compose poetry with Li Shengweng, Zhang Tianhan, and others on weekends. It was the same in Western Zhejiang, except that the famous scholars who accompanied him were Zhang Tianfang, Cao Tianfeng, Jiang Daxin, and others. His poetry followed the style of Huang Shangu and Han Tuizhi, revealing spirituality from simplicity and actively promoting national salvation consciousness. His calligraphy was close to the style of Yu Youren, and those who obtained it cherished it greatly.</p>
<p>In Western Zhejiang, he worked to strike at the Japanese puppets and assist the Allied forces. Although his work was not as flamboyant as it was in the Third District, it was calm, firm, and his command and planning were more flexible. After General Doolittle's first bombing of Tokyo, when his plane crashed in Yuqian, as well as the assistance given to Westerners from Shanghai who sought refuge inland, were all planned and supported by him. He was very physically strong. When he went to restaurants, he liked to eat large plates of fish and meat, devouring them voraciously. The small restaurants in the mountain villages were often thrown into a frenzy by his eating habits. His clothing was extremely poor. He wore the same set of grass-green twill military uniform for three or four years and refused to change it. He looked like a down-on-his-luck veteran. He wore riding boots without socks. Once, when visiting a friend, the host insisted that he take off his boots, putting him in an extremely awkward situation.</p>
<p>"Director He is willing to take responsibility, and it's really a pleasure to work under him," was the unanimous praise of many military and political cadres. When an employee left, he would always give them a sum of travel expenses and inquire earnestly about their new opportunities. The literary friends who associated with him were all assisted by him. He emptied his private purse, resulting in his current desolate state after death.</p>
<p>Before his death, he was the director of the Third Division of the Central Organization Department. He habitually walked to and from work and ate lunch in small restaurants. When the weather was hot in the middle and early part of last month, he became ill from eating watermelon. He didn't pay much attention to it at first, but later, due to financial constraints, he delayed treatment. In a short period of two or three days, his condition suddenly worsened, and he died unexpectedly. Currently, the education expenses for his children are being raised by friends in Zhejiang Province. The many slanderous words against him in the past can now be swept away.</p>
<p>The demise of this Hu Linyi-like political decision-maker in a chaotic world is undoubtedly a great loss of talent at the present time.</p>
