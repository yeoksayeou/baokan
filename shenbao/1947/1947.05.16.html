<h3>立院例會修正通過　立監委選　罷法條例　臨時動議取締選舉舞弊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立監委選罷法施行條例案，業經十五日晨三二五次例會修正通過，至有關行憲各種法規及施行條例，除一部份尙待複議及若干細節有待研究者外，可謂已全部通過　今日例會由孫院長主席，出席立委百餘人，首討論立委選罷法施行條例，柳克述等對職業代表選舉辦法提出疑問，主張選舉以分區爲宜，蓋不如是，邊地職業團體吃虧太大，鄧鴻業提醒職業代表，選舉勿爲少數包辦職業團體者所操縱。最後決議，將第八條第三款刪去，而於附表中詳細規定，藉免各種糾紛。繼討論選舉票書寫方式，程元斟等認以圈選方法爲便。孫院長亦贊同此一意見，決議將原草案所定書寫姓名方法改爲圈選法。本案全文六十九條經一小時許討論，予以通過。</p>
<p>次討論監委選能法施行條例，根據憲法，監委由各省市議會，蒙古西藏地方議會及華僑團體依憲法第九十一條規定之名額，分別選舉之，性質與立委選舉不同，辦理亦較前者爲易，略經討論即全條通過。</p>
<p>立委名額及選區表　大部份已決議通過</p>
<p>至此，最爲各方關心之立委名額分配及選區劃分問題，於會中提出，今日決議通過者有下列五種，即：（一）江蘇等十八省立委名額分配及選區劃分表，（Fg）蒙古立委名額分配表，（三）西藏立委名額分配表，（四）各民族在邊疆地區選出之立委名額分配表，（五）不分區之各省市立委名額分配表。其中蘇，浙，湘三省及西藏立法委員名額分配，尙待重新調整。至職業團體曁僑居國外國民立委名額分配，尙待各主管機關擬表送會，另作決定，故未提出。</p>
<p>各省市立委名額共六二二名，分一一四區選出，討論時孫九錄對江蘇金壇應劃入第一區抑第二區，提出疑問，浙湘籍委員對各該省劃區亦提出意見，決議上述各省選區劃分問題，由各該省籍委員討論後，再作決定。其他各省則皆無問題通過。按江蘇省六三縣市，人口（三六四六九三二一）人，應產生立委三八人，分七區選舉，其中僅金壇縣屬於第一區抑第二區，尙未作最後決定。茲將各區所屬縣市名稱列後：第一區，鎭江，句容，丹陽，溧水，高淳，江寗，江浦，六合，儀徵，江都，高郵等十一縣，選立委五人，事務所設鎭江。第二區，武進，無錫，常熟，江陰，宜興，溧陽，金壇（未定）等七縣，選立委五人，事務所設武進。第三區，吳縣，吳江，崑山，太倉，靑浦，嘉定，寳山，金山，上海，松江，奉賢，川沙，南匯，崇明等十四縣，選立委五人，事務所設吳縣。第四區，南通，海門，啓東，如皋，泰興，靖江等六縣，選立委五人，事務所設甫通。第五區，東台，興化，寳應，泰縣，揚中，阜寗，鹽城等七縣，選立委六人，事務所設東台。第六區，淮陰，淮安，漣水，灌雲，贛楡，東海，沭陽，連雲市等八縣市，選立委四人，事務所設淮陰。第七區，徐州市，銅山，碭山，豐縣，蕭縣，鄧縣，睢寗，泗陽，宿遷，沛縣等十縣市，選立委五人，事務所設徐州市。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院十五日晨開會時，簡貫三臨時動議，擬謂另行制定「選舉舞弊取締法」，以限谷種選舉舞弊情事，其理由爲行憲期近，各種選舉即正式開始，此爲我實行民主之先聲，關係殊鉅，傳聞競選者中不乏腦滿腸肥之大腹賈，挾其雄厚資力，從事競選，鈔票之多，數以噸計，當非雖有才智而囊空如洗之士所能與之頡頏。簡氏指出，有人估計參加立委競選所需交際費，請客費，非三萬萬元不辦，常人何能負担？爲防制他日選舉盡爲大腹賈包辦計，實有制定單行法必要。黃同昌等對此建議甚表贊同，並提及除應防止利誘外，對於以槍桿威脅之行爲，亦應嚴爲防範。會中決議，該案先付憲法法規委會研究，再交大會討論。</p>
<h3>王寵惠論和談關鍵　能否恢復全在中共之一念</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕新任國府委員王寵惠氏昨就和平運動之醞釀，發表意見稱，和談能否恢復，全在中共之一念決定，蓋政府始終認爲和平之門未閉，亦無時不希望和平早日實現，由國府委員會仍爲中共保留席位，可見政府確具誠意，實現和平並非一方面想之望所能濟事，必須中共亦具誠意，始有實現之可能。</p>
<h3>立委呼籲和平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委周一志等二十人十五日向大會提一臨時緊急動議，呼籲和平，該案因時間關係，留待下次大會討論</p>

<h3>敎部深盼學生　切勿輕信流言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電」敎部發言人頃對記者談稱，近日各校發生風潮，起因甚多，但大部係因有人造謠，造成敎育界不安情况。具體言之，如最近交通大學之更名與合併管理學院及上海醫藥界所傳之藥專將改五年制等，敎部均幷未有此種決定，而各核同學以愛校心切，有請願等事發生，但敎部對於任何決定，均經縝密硏究并請專家討論，絕不致輕易從事，深盼全國同學，切勿輕信謠言，安心學業云。</p>

<h3>對台灣省政之希望</h3>
<p>台劃省政府，定於今日正式成立。魏道明主席已於昨日飛台。台北各機關團體學校，決定本日舉行紀念會，慶祝新省府成立，幷歡迎魏主席道明之蒞任。台灣的政治，台灣的現狀，自「二二八」以來，國人十分重視，今台灣人事更新，輿論改觀，我們對於新台灣的政治，台灣新省府的措施，自有無限的希望，寄予魏主席曁台灣人士。</p>
<p>台灣一島，雖孤懸海外，然與祖國關係，遠在千年以前，人種文化與祖國同源，國民經濟與祖國同體。過去鄭成功之驅荷蘭，唐景崧邱逢甲之抗日，以及台灣倫陷後之半世紀，雙國志士之復土奮鬥，皆有可歌可泣的史蹟，足以驚天地而泣鬼神。此次抗戰勝利，台灣光復，雪甲午之恥，返台胞於祖國懷抱，人心興奮，舉國騰歡。孰知一年以來，因爲經濟朱復常態，加以改軍未臻合理，遂致醖成『二二八』事變，星星之火，竟至燎原，還是台灣的不幸，祖國的不幸。事變經過，一時轟傳中外，雖所傳不免言過其實，而造成事變的因素很多，雖不能完全責諸制度，歸咎人事；但是制度和人事，不適宜於現在情况必須更張，必須調整，則爲顯明的事實。兩月以來，中央處理謹愼，除派國防部長白祟禧氏前往視察穴慰外，幷依白民報吿及建議，決然廢除行政長官制，照現行省政府組織法，成立台灣省政府，改任文治人物魏道明爲主席。同時，參攷新疆省府組織大略，主席迄各應處，均設副職，廣攬當地人材，共同參加政府，以期溝通政府與人民的感情。此種重大改革，不做爲刷新台政之先聲，幷為樹立文人主持省政之前奏。所以，自合政改革，人事調整消息公佈後，實給與中外人士極大的興奮，台胞亦以歡欣之情，歡迎中央賢明的措施。我們對於合灣的政治，合灣的現狀，素極關懷，今日新省府成立，萬象更新，特再就台灣的政治，合灣現狀的改革，貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>第一，台灣地方自治基礎具備，地方自治應卓日實現。蔣主席於三月十日，曾表示台省地方自治，可提前完成：希望新省府成立後，重要的施政，應爲地方自治之籌備，普選之指導，究成地方官吏之潠舉。根據此次「二二八」事變經騐，合胞除極少數態度偏頗，受日人或共黨煽惑，在言「驅逐阿山」「打倒半阿山」外。大多數仍識大體，民間實不乏明遝之士。過去台胞與政府感情隔閡，滋生事端的原故，由于台胞缺少從政機會。此次新政府成立，合省賢能多參加省府，如地方自治開始，導當地人材爲地方服務，確甚合乎民主政治的緒神，幷使地方政治日趨向上發展。</p>
<p>第二，經濟改革，爲今日台省重要之圖。魏主席離滬飛台前，曾談「經濟方面，幣制暫時不擬改革，惟當地經濟環境特殊，專　制度取消後，是否完全允許自由貿易，或在安定經濟原則下略加限制，須待實地考察後決定。」足徵魏氏對地方經濟改革，態度愼重，有待蒞任視察或聽取民間意見後辦理。依我們的研究，台灣專賣制度，無論辦法或技術，多少有碍貿易之發展。希望經濟改革第一聲，爲專賣制度之次第取消，及有條件的自由貿易之提倡，使內地與合灣，貨殖互通往來，以輸出易輸入。此不僅活潑國民經濟，並可發展合省工商業，從而解決部份失業恐慌，實有裨益社會之安定。</p>
<p>第三，博取民意，樹立民主精神。自「二二八」事變以來，政府與人民感情，始終未能融合，現在新政府成立，爲爭取人心，自應博取民意，訪求民隱，以作施政之準繩。事變後，長官公署拘捕之人物，希望寬大處理；若干休刋報紙，希望准其自由復刋，一醒合胞耳目。抑又有進者，參加「二二八」事變，少數偏激人民及退伍軍人，現皆逃居深山潛伏，國軍正準備搜尋。台灣深山，為高山族所居，後輩潛伏高山族羣中，必貽後患無窮。希望新政府及警備當局，本寬大爲懷之精神，以招撫方法，予以自新之路，否則曠日持久，勢必影響社會安寗。至關於退伍軍人的出路，往昔長官公署抱歧視態度，希望今後多從敎育上生活上，導彼等入於正軌。省政府如能這樣作，相信官民隔閡可以打消，任何思想矛盾皆可消弭。</p>
<p>第四，敎育之重要，亦關係今後合灣甚大。過去半世紀，合胞被日本分化敎育的毒素浸潤，對祖國認識欠深切，光復以來，合胞與內地人士因言語逈異，致引起若干誤會。希望今後省政府，對於中小學敎育，及國語文史之敎育，特別努力，尤盼網羅各方人才，蒞台推行，以改變一般台胞對祖國的觀感，實爲根本之圖。</p>
<p>要之，台政之改革，及新政之建設，經緯萬端，固不止此，但目前之勵精圖治，則捨此莫求。我們本「反求諸己」的態度，希望台灣新省政府，在魏主席的領導下，以新的精神，新的作風，興利除書，循撫安輯，推進自治，樹立民主，以慰台胞內向之股，望洽之誠！</p>

<h3>金振玉蔣建白二參政員　招待各界徴詢意見　俾提出參政會議轉達政府採納</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕由本市民選產生之參政員金振玉及蔣建白兩氏，以本屆參政會即將於本月二十日在京召開，特於昨午四時，在康樂酒樓招待本市參議員，區長，區民代表會主席，徵求意見，俾在大會中轉達政府採納。計到潘議長。徐副議長，市黨部書記長謝仁釗及參議員，區長，區民代表會主席等約百餘人。</p>
<p>潘議長在金，蔣二氏致詞後，即被推發表意見稱：金。蔣二參政員在會前徵求意見，此舉値得重視，希望各位儘量發言。至菜本人願二位代向政府請求者有三點：</p>
<p>（一）據一般估計，上海市所貢獻與政府之稅收，約佔全國百分之四十以上，然政府對於各省市經費均有補助，而上海獨無。政府當局及一般人士以爲上海不需要補助，實則上海市政建設費用浩大，尤以在敵偽時期，破壞甚重，復興困難，若單恃經常收入，決不足應付。又如垃圾堆積，日益增多，關係市民健康市容等，莫此爲甚。此項淸除費用，尤非政府協助不可。政府旣欲使上海成爲第一大都市，發展工商等，然經費則不予撥助，則非但不能建設，且將使原有設施無法維持。故希望政府能派員來此實地考察，同時補助經費。</p>
<p>實施決策須先考慮</p>
<p>（二）邇來上海社會秩序混亂，欲使其安定，必須在各方面都加注意，以後希望中央注意，許多主管部會之決策，是否有足以影響或增加製造不安定因素。政府決策須按緩急先後，次第執行，否則徒然使中央政令不能貫澈，而地方區域，先起紛擾，致使地方長官及行政幾構，反因是而使　　上之金錢，時間，人力受到損失。故盼參政員請問政府，在實施決策之前有否作周詳之考慮。至席人自擾之事，則更應少做。</p>
<p>直轄地位應速確立</p>
<p>（三）上海市以及其他各直轄市之地位始終未予確定，現在地方自治機構逐漸建立，而政府對眞轄市法規猶未頒布，故必須請中央確立直轄市之地位，同時在立法院訂立法規時，並應徵詢直轄市民意機關之意見。</p>
<p>繼由陶百川參議員，以過去曾任參政員經騐，貢獻意見謂：參政會乃一團結之綫路，過去相當順利，現則不無缺憾，故必需使其仍爲一眞正團結之綫路，惟欲達到此目的，尙應通過二重大門，即（一）統一之門，團結以統一爲條件，當喚起全國上下注意之，（二）民主之門，蓋民主亦爲團結必經之門。</p>
<p>旋由謝仁劉，童行白，邵氷生等相繼發言，對憲法，地方自治法規等均提供意見。</p>

<p>（二）轉學手續</p>
<p>何達君問：舍弟本就學甲校，因發覺甲校尙未立案，乃轉入乙校，一學期後，甲校立案已准，復轉甲校。今向乙校索轉學證書，據稱：「該生轉入本校時之轉學證書，呈教廳後，因前校未立案，已被退還，故本校無學籍，不能出具證書」。今舍弟在甲校旁聽，請敎貴欄應如何處理？</p>

<p>人心仍振，一五二號力購現永紗後，七六號一一七號亦猛吸遞永紗，十一時三十五分，終於由八九號一五七號掛漲停，現永紗由一七一號一八八號一四一號掛漲停，永公由九九號，信和由一三四號掛停，新光大通中紡統益景綸亦迫停限，曾將暗盤抬高至六一三〇元光景。一五二號一八六號二二四號二一八號逢高脫手，午收僅加二十元，惟收後仍在六一〇〇元外。結果較前收計永紗美亞漲停，永公信和漲停後有回，與新光同升成半弱。勤興景福升一成，新華半成强。遞交計永紗美亞漲停，永公亦然，新光漲停後有回，與景福勤興各漲一成强至成半弱。冷股計麗安榮豐中紡景綸漲停，水泥中絲新亞商務各升一成左右。</p>
<p>午後忽傳</p>
<p>外匯牌價即將調整之訊，開出即吿飛黃騰達，美亞永紗信和新光新亞水泥永公大通榮豐統益景福火柴麗安景綸新華商務次第漲停。遞永紗由一四三號八九號一二九號一七七號九四號五四號七六號一六號一五四號等買進，暗市喊高至六四〇〇元外。一五二號一五六號一一〇號脫手，退至六三五〇元左右，中紡中絲亦吿漲停，全塲除永業九福，一致掛紅。一二九號七六號一四一號再進至六四〇〇元外結束，美亞貼價達三千元，信和一六〇元，新光五元，景福勤興三元左右。結果較前收計永業九福而外，一致漲達限度，場外各股均見微升。</p>
<p>套利交易由高而低</p>
<p>套利交交易昨自高而低，永紗因銀行幫初時旁觀，曾見四百元高價，而後步降至二一〇元，午收二四〇元。信和自二〇〇元退至一三〇元。美亞自二三六〇元降至一四二〇元。小型股在七元至九元之間。息價約自三角光景低至一角半內。午後永紗貼在二〇〇元至二五〇元間，合息價約一角七八分。</p>
<p>一四五號暫停交易</p>
<p>證交昨通告略稱，一四五號經紀人彭雲舫經當場外交易，逃避交易稅及違背交易稅，分別由直接稅局及法院處理，未判決前應暫停交易云。</p>
<p>統債轉堅</p>
<p>公債昨亦盤旋而堅，統丙開盤一五二〇〇元，低價一四九〇〇元，而以一六六〇〇元高價結束。潤德三六〇室五五一室有供，五五二室五〇三室則進。較前收計甲乙戊各漲一千元，統丙好一千六，統丁升一千一，成交約七百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股濟漲</p>
<p>外股昨亦拉高，證券帮洋行帮先出後進，廣帮買胃較濃，錢兌業有售，港申電在十八元半間，過程甚爲平庸。怡紗晨開七一〇〇〇元，低價六八五〇〇元，高價七九五〇〇元，而後略盤。結果較前收計怡紗紙業怡牌航業墾植各漲二成至二成半强，會德豐業廣英聯鋼業電話開平各升一成至成半强。</p>
<h3>漢商運大鈔　在曲江查獲</h3>
<p>漢口大鈔流往廣州岡利，財政當局極爲重視，分令有關機關嚴爲查禁。頃據漢口消息：已在曲江車站抄獲十餘億元。現漢商裏足不前，漢市匯水已轉跌。</p>
<h3>郵局開辦　支票儲金</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局關於儲金匯業事務部份，近爲便利公衆流通金融起見，特自令（十六〇日起添辦「支票儲金」業務，現暫定首次存入金額至少爲一千元，即可領用支票簿，辦法與領用四行二局支票相同。聞日後將逐步推行至本區各重要支局及內地各局，庶成爲最普遍化之「支票儲金」云。</p>
<h3>新光增資後　首次股東會</h3>
<p>昨晨十時，「新光內衣公司」假座靑年會九樓召開增資後第一次股東臨時會，出席股東三百餘人，佔股額三億五千四百餘股，正式開會。傅良駿主席，報吿增資足額經過情形，張監察騐資證明無悞。市塲盛傳該公司續有贈股消息，據王常董表示：本年中或將實現云。</p>
<h3>出口物資恢復收購　原則業已決定</h3>
<p>目前國內物價高漲，影饗生產成本，出口物資價格，亦因成本增加而隨之上漲，出口事業幾陷於全部停頓狀態。政府爲維護出口業，解救當前出口業之困難起見，決恢復收購政策。茲據聯合徵信所記者探悉，經全國經濟委員會，經濟部，財政部，中央銀行等有關機關，切實研究之結果，業已決定原則：（一）國外需有市塲者，（二）商人無力轍出者。凡合乎上列原則之出口物資，始予收購。收購事宜，由中信局辦理。其收購價格，則按合理之市價計算。是項原則決定後，已着手草擬實施辦法。出口業人士，對政府此種措施，極表感奮，並希望免除收購時之各種流弊。</p>
<h3>市場實銷淸淡　粳秈米均見回挫　麵粉市化閒散賡續下游</h3>
<p>昨南北市共到米糧四千九百餘石，店方門銷淸閒，市塲實銷冷懈。南北市粳米一致續挫萬元，秈米亦然再低五六千元。白元步削三五千元，陰元中下等跟跌三五千元。麵粉因常錫有貨到申，市化閒散，賡續下游，再跌二三千元。麩皮廠方繼續供應，人心虛軟，逐步下降，猛跌四五千元</p>
<p>豆餅交易尙可，早市開盤形勢緊俏，收市略轉疲軟，結果軋升千元。黃豆本街油廠互相競購，貨主轉堅，飛騰萬元。</p>
<p>油市消化動而不旺，先漲後回，盤升萬元。生仁傳聞產區有禁止出口之說，人心激昂，猛漲一二萬元。芝蔴去胃仍淡，形居疲中徘徊。菉豆本街外埠去路極少，恐難生色。赤豆一蹶不振，續跌三五千元。紅糧節節下挫，步縮一二千元，苞未堅挺。</p>
<p>南京新元麥已初次見新，產地每百市斤價九萬元。</p>
<h3>台糖市價猛降　白糖市價猛降</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台糖公司第十五期仍照上期配售，二四粗白及三半車白外，更可加配二〇中砂白三十二萬元，台赤三十萬元二項，而銀根亦緊，故趨勢軟化，齊見下降。秘魯細砂初市即破四十萬關，後爲三十七萬五千元，猛跌五萬元。二四粗白四十一萬元跌四萬餘元，二〇中砂白三十九萬元小二萬五千元。四半車白三十九萬元至四十萬元小五萬元，三半車白三十八萬元，跌四萬五千元，其他土糖亦跟踪下游，興化白三十六萬五千元，小三萬元，興赤二十八萬元小萬元。提靑廿六萬小五千元，順德靑廿四萬五千元，台赤三十二萬元。</p>
<h3>存米七千噸　行總糧部領取</h3>
<p>據行總息：糧食部總倉庫，前月曾與行總交換食米七千噸。該七千噸食米，係田糧食部代行總在漢口撥付分署，復由行總代糧食部撥付該部上海總倉庫七千噸，以免運輸上之往返。但糧部　倉庫尙未向行總領取，聞行總方面已函請糧部領取。</p>
<h3>針織業廠商　要求紡建配紗</h3>
<p>四區針織工業會員六百餘單位，自紡建配紗以來，前曾由該業同業公會向紡建領配後，查照各會員實際需要情形，平均分配。旋紡建改變辦法，飭由各該廠商各自申請，經由該業於去年十二月間依照表格塡明後，由公會彙轉紡建，迄今已閱半載，其中經核配者雖有，然仍有二百餘單位，或經調查而不加准否，或竟未曾派員調查。最近紡建決定新廠停配，該未獲配之二百餘針織廠商，誠恐被指爲新廠而不予配給，連日會議決定，向紡建催詢前送表格之決定辦法，並要求平均配給。</p>
<h3>紗市初俏後疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，初開以廠商及客帮等採辦甚暢，喊價挺進。四十二支藍鳳曾喊高至一千二百六十萬元，二十支雙馬亦高見六百六十五萬元，迨後因前日紡建公司配價雖提高，然配額增加，昨軋進頭寸甚多，致問藥銀根轉緊。而一般浮戶見高了結，價遂回瀉。結果四二支藍鳳及二十支雙馬，與上日軋平，其他粗　互有漲跌云。</p>
<h3>官價提高　棉布做高居多</h3>
<p>昨棉布市况：因紡建開售廿五種布疋價格提高，龍頭細布及四君子金印嗶嘰均爲二十七萬元，塲內做開頗暢，蓋聞紗布出口規則公佈，對華中區運銷限制較寬，故客幫出手添辦，而該業中人扳價甚力，最後結果十二磅龍頭細布高至廿七萬三一千元，比上日步升五千元。其他各牌細布亦一律軋漲，自六七千元至一萬元。至漂布色布色斜及藍布士林布等價，均軋升自二三千元至一萬餘元不一。</p>
<h3>花呢售價上揚</h3>
<p>呢羢毛織品中，以花呢之類最爲繁雜，銷路之暢盛與否，大半以寒暖氣節爲轉移。近年來細毛花呢遠較粗毛花呢爲暢銷活躍，但因輸入品不能運到，祗靠香港帶來，物希爲貴，造成申織本廠貨之良機。因市貨流通缺乏，本廠貨售價大半躍漲，幾與美國貨相並。賣買雙方鑒於派力司凡立頂夏貨之昂貴，視花呢類尙屬便宜，而後市大半尙看再好，因此多互相居奇。昨市花呢每碼齊欲二十五萬元，一般呢羢廠家，卜利之豐，堪稱得未曾有。</p>
<p>華新呢絨特價</p>
<p>華新呢絨公司存貨充沛，菸定於十六日起，特價出售二星期，各貨自七拆至八拆，誠爲現的一般漲價聲中之好消息。</p>
<h3>絲織聯營產額　不及預定目標</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲織聯營公司第一期三個月之產品目標，本定各式綢緞八萬四千疋，茲者兩月已屆，產品總額，共達四萬疋之譜，不及預定目標。據公司某負責人談稱：本公司產品，目的在於外銷，故品質方面，務求上乘，以配合國外人士需要。故對各廠設備，織機，織品之門幅，花式等，常不時調整改變。致開工最初之兩月，不啻尙在試騐期中，過此生產情形即可納入常軌云。</p>
<h3>茶市疲風蔓延</h3>
<p>專供外銷之紅綠茶，昨海外雖仍致電本市茶商，略加間訊，惟出價極細，聞去年度陳茶縮至十三便士至十七便士左右，尙有胃口，而照此價格，出口行勢須虧蝕甚鉅，是以交易賡續消沉，人心不振。依現狀觀測，洋莊茶市，疲風恐將逐漸蔓延。他若各種內銷花色，則在供求相埒中，比前絕少參差。茲悉，目前客帮各地對於粗紅茶，復見靑睞，售價方面，如能適合胃口，或於日內即將捲土重來，從事吸取云。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣執委會　通過要案多起</h3>
<p>擬組華南輸入出管委會</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委會執委會於昨日上午十時，在中天銀行舉行會議。到陳副主委光甫，委員劉攻芸，吳任滄，沈熙瑞，任嗣達，陳雋人，顧問馬格，卜益恩等，由陳副主委主席，討論至十二時卅分散會。</p>

<h3>中國農民銀行決定　本年度農貸計劃　對內着重舉辦民衣民食貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國農民銀行息：該行本年度農貸計劃，大致綱要如次：（一）對外着重舉辦出農產品貸款，諸如蠶絲，茶葉貸款。目的在增加輸出，爭取外匯。</p>
<p>蠶絲貸款，已知者有春繭貸款一千二百億元，包括收繭，合作烘繭，乾繭抵押，繅工費用等貸款。此外尙有一百億元，專貸予蠶晨育蠶製種之用。</p>
<p>茶貸方面，計劃額度，在七八百億元之間，包括茶農生產，加工，押匯，抵押等貸款在內。</p>
<p>（二）對內着重舉辦民衣民食貸款（甲）民衣方面，計劃舉辦棉花生產貸款八百億元。至加工運卻等貸款，將待棉花秋收時，再行舉辦。一方面將儘量利用聯總之軋花廠設備，分區成立軋花廠。</p>
<p>（乙）民食方面，有糧食增產貸款數百億元。貸款主要對象爲水稻，小麥次之。又民衣民食兩項貸款，將以實物貸放爲主，如發放豆餅化學肥料等是。（三）其他一般農貸如農業生產，農村副業，農產運銷，晨用水利，農業推廣（包括優良晨具畜種等）等五項，亦仍照舊舉辦云。</p>
<h3>四聯總處　結束生產貸款　四月底前未放者　決一律註銷原案</h3>
<p>四聯總處，去年奉令舉辦之臨時生產專業貸款，已屆結束階段。頃悉：所有四月底以前尙未訂約用款，及雖已訂約尙未用款者，四聯總處爲便利結束起見，決概予註銷原案，不再貸款。但爲顧及事實計，各廠商可照一般貸款辦法，另案向四聯總處申請。</p>
<h3>烟煤市價續跌</h3>
<p>煤市白煤市况尙稱平靜，行市亦鮮上落，烟煤江西鄱縣統煤及豐城統煤，到貨絡續，以廠方配煤已派定，進胃微細，致人心虛軟，市價愈盤愈低。開平二號屑價已退入八〇萬元，尙缺受主。鄱樂統煤數天來已自九十五萬步跌至七十萬，一時尙無法大批拋售。</p>
<h3>麝香貨稀價漲</h3>
<p>香漲價，來貨稀少，原因爲申地售價過低，產地乏人狩獵，申售與產地工價相埒，再加運費等，成本加重，反有虧本之慮。時値夏令，此係痧藥等之必需品，以致需要大增，所以售價提高，以招產地運申。</p>
<h3>豬鬃惨跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕猪鬃市况，一厥不振，滬鬃每磅跌至一元七角，漢鬃三元四角，渝鬃二元一角七分，今市猪鬃市價，均呈慘跌。</p>
<p>木材市况</p>
<p>杉木市氣不振，因聞產地報價，成本在一千七百元之間，洋松市氣略堅。</p>
<h3>雲母准予输入</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轍管會頃對雲母之輸入，准許改列附表三（甲）末項，作爲補充材料進口云。</p>
<h3>取締賣買銀元</h3>
<p>街頭賣買銀元者又形活躍，警局頃分令黃浦及老閘兩分局從嚴取締。凡經查獲者，除沒收其銀圓外，並移送地檢處法辦。</p>
<h3>持貨者不肯脫手　人造絲盤旋上升　廠絲喊價見高綢貨銷滯</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市仍見高升，一二〇號高山有光開盤喊六百八十萬元，盤旋上升，迄午收盤爲七百十萬元。下午人心更好，持貨者堅不脫手，以致喊價又比上午大二十萬元，結果比上日又高八十萬元。全日成交只四五箱，爲實銷戶所吸收，其他各牌有光，一致提升。七五號半光喊價二千五百萬元，惟無成交。</p>
<p>廠絲昨市頗有成交，各檔做開三四十包，A級做價一千九百七十萬元，C級做價九百三十萬元，俱較上日喊價大三十萬至五十萬元之譜。干經較呆，喊價仍站上日原盤。</p>
<p>綢貨實銷淸淡，塲內交易亦頗冷靜。被面喊價照舊未動，格子豐綢先做二萬九千五百元，後做一百至二百元，最近聞廠絲價高，仍喊二萬九千五百元，餘貨均無甚變動。</p>
<p>配售人絲　正請示中</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局之人造絲，停配已久，絲織界頗爲矚目。茲據該局某主管當局談稱：該局對配售人造絲事宜，現正呈請行政院指示機宜中，俾便有所遵循。渠稱：市面人造絲，實際上並不缺貨。估計各廠存底，亦不致全部枯竭。市面喊價雖高，實際成交極爲有限云。</p>
<h3>印禁絲織品進口　外部已飭令詳查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區絲織業公會，前以聞印度將於本年六月底起，暫時禁止國外絲織品輸入事，曾函陳外交部探詢詳情。茲據外交部復示，略謂：已飭令我國駐印大使，就近調查詳情，如係屬實，當將作必要之交涉。又聞美國方面，對此事亦將採取同樣措置云。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>醫師法應該修改嗎？</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>四月六日，本刋有一位屠夫先生，寫了一篇「評醫師法的不平鳴」，這篇文章針對着我在二月廿八日所發表的「由醫師換證談到醫師法」而發的「不平鳴」，讀完了這篇充滿士大夫氣息之宏論外，還遺留下一個猙獰可怕的面孔，但，我並不好辯，可是，對善意之指摘，則從不拒絕，而對無理的侮衊，却不得不反抗。</p>
<p>首先，要申明的，屠夫先生能對有關醫政的問題注意，實表欽佩，不過，對我原文的意思予以曲解，這眞是憾事，希望屠夫先生平心靜氣，再讀一次，溫故知新，則有厚望焉。</p>
<p>舉個例，我認爲醫師法的第三條第三款中所規定的，簡直是對科學醫一種重大阻碍，明顯的又是給非科學醫一種便利，這樣長此下去，將形成非科學醫專業務的抬頭，可是，我們的屠夫先生，竟將原意曲解，他認爲我們的不平，就是要和中醫爭取檢竅資格相等的程度，他自以爲是正統派，給人加上帽子，像他說的「自認爲西醫者流，執行西醫業務五年以上，卓著聲譽者，也應當可以檢覈合格」，這硬是不近人情的推論，同樣的，更證明屠夫先生是勇於意氣之爭，我們知道，中醫的學　是玄而不實，職業中醫的程度，更是參維不齊，形形色色，而本身又處處呈現矛盾，例如，古方與時方對峙，空想與經騐並立，這校的醫，難道還要給予延長壽命的辦法麽？讓其自生自滅之不暇，爲什麽還要指示其一條出路呢？這不是直接給科學醫的一種活辱和岐視麼？正如屠夫先生說的，以台灣爲例：「在台灣民國前十年，就停止了中醫的登記，努力於科學醫的培植」，但，爲什麽我們要努力於非科學醫的培植呢？就拿我們的醫師法來說，中醫的登記祗要有五年執業，聲譽車著就可及格，這不是違反進步的科學律麼？看看台灣，想想自己，屠夫先生能否說這是「差堪告慰」，的一件事？</p>
<p>屠夫先生認爲現行醫師法，是「中國立法的一大汚點」，正因爲是一大汚點，我們就不得不顧慮到『幾千年，或幾百年後，我們的子孫會怎樣的怨恨和嘲笑」，我們以「廿世紀祖宗的身份」，發現了「汚點」，就該及時修改糾正，決不能讓這汚點留在歷史上，給我們的子孫去嘲笑和怨恨，這一重要因素，竟被屠夫先生曲解，硬要說我們「自認爲西醫者流」想去爭取和中醫檢覈相等的資格，這眞是屠夫先生道義上的一大汚點和「不平鳴」的憾事。</p>
<p>我勸屠夫先生，不要僅羡慕日本維新，（見該文第四段）而自甘卑下的去「不寒而慄」，這樣，對事實，對眞理是無益，要想想日本維新爲什麼會成功？我們爲什麽還有封建的餘物殘留？我國醫藥界正因爲有了像屠夫先生那樣的開明份子，所以，纔有尊重非科事業的合法立塲，我們不能單純歸咎於「立法的汚點」，因爲，在我們領導科學醫的集團中，就有很多「値得贊揚」的，使進步的，在開着倒車，這些，就是法規在草案初步擬定時，就被卑躬屈膝了，還有什麽可說呢？屠夫先生，除了將科學與非科學醫的不平，歸咎於「中國的立法」外，並且，還特別強　我國的「衛生事業失敗」原因，　之於「黨國元老」，君不見，在他宏論的第六段，明白寫下：」衛生當局能勉强做到保持科學醫師的水準，已是難能可貴，要想他們能據理力爭，說服黨國元老，即刻效法日本維新，走上科學建國的路，那就希望太高」，照屠夫先生的意見，似乎是黨國元老不要科學建國，不願效法日本維新，希望中國就停留在十八世紀不科學的時代裏，我想這除了是汚辱「有功黨國」，「推翻滿淸」的元老外，間接，還想挑撥老百姓與元老的感情，使人民不忠於國家，屠夫先生眞是罪莫大焉！屠夫先生並加强語氣的說：「……敷衍着做一點能做的事，是弱者，沒有力量抵拒那些元老們的勢力」，這種不打自招，弄巧反拙的不智的論調，無形中却害了我們勞苦功高，領導保持科學醫師水準的衛生署，因爲，照屠夫先生的說法，衛生署的困難，是不能說服黨國一元老，不能抵拒黨國元老的勢力，而並沒有內在外在其他的困難，相反的，若果，能說服黨國元老，則就不會「祗能敷衍着做一點能做的事」，但，我們老百姓，却要問黨國元老，爲什麽不希望自己的國家維新，爲什麽阻碍科學建國工作？</p>
<p>最後，屠夫先生主張醫師法完全推翻，這種過激的自由主義思想，我實在不敢同流合汚，因為，一個國家沒有法，能成爲一個國家麽？不過，我們有理由請求修正不合的法，促使其納入正軌，這種手續是對的，好在公道自在人心，人心就是法庭，是非曲直，旁觀者自明，故，在不得已時，余絕無好辯的興趣，最後，忠告屠夫先生不要用老而不死的姿態，指鹿爲馬的「自認爲西醫者流……」侮　原意，勸你還是放下屠刀，否則你仍然是要被人屠的。</p>
<h3>灌輸醫學常識的方式問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>現在進一步來說，什麽一類的題材，才算合於做灌輸醫識的通俗文字，怎麽樣的文字，才算適於民衆的口胃，而易爲民衆所消化的呢？這，殊無嚴格的界綫可以分　。然在大體上，可以分爲二部份來說：一是屬於取材的題材方面，一是屬於寫作文時的技巧問題。</p>
<p>先說取材的題材方面：灌輸醫學常識的目標，旣然是非醫界的一般民衆，那末，所採取的題村，必須爲一般民衆所必需的醫識題材，日常知識才是。如醫學的本身意義，醫療的本身價値，均爲一般民衆所應當認識的。得病時的如何擇醫，病後的如何處理（當然是被處理），病愈之後的如何調養等等，亦均爲一般民衆不可缺乏的常識。至於日常生活中的衛生法則，如何避免疾病的來臨侵犯，即所謂「防患於未然」，醫學上的術語，呌做「預防」。凡類乎此的種種知識，都是屬之於大衆所必需的常識範圍，亦是我們寫作灌輸醫識文字時的絕好題材！</p>
<p>至於醫學上的治療部份，尤共是醫療上的手術部份，那是越少越妙！就是說到了治療方面的話語，也只能的治療方針或治療的原則為限；因爲說到治療方面的知識，便多半是屬於醫師本身的範圍，至於治療上的種種手術，更加是醫師的事情，絕無於灌輸醫識的當兒，拿牠作爲題材，向民衆去宣傳的必要！如果把這種不是爲民衆所需要的治療方法，甚至於診療上的手術，不三不四的向民衆去宣傳，去灌輸，那末，一般的民衆，每可因一時的不愼，而發生意外，鬧出亂子的。這不是愛之適足以害之嗎？就是近來有一部份報紙上的醫藥問答，盡量介紹藥品，甚或招徠病人，這都不是很妥當的辦法；在醫藥解答上，公開來招徠病人，似乎有妨醫者的人格道德；解答醫藥問題，動不動介紹藥品，告病人自己去買藥亂吃，更屬是冒險非凡的舉動，萬一鬧出亂子，關出窮禍，作醫藥解答的朋友，難道卸得脫責任嗎？所以，我對於醫藥問答這件事，以爲只能在灌輸醫學常識的原則上，去作醫藥學上的疑難問題的解答，切不可以任意敎授療法，更不可以胡亂介紹藥品！</p>
<p>再說到寫作醫識文字時的技巧方面，寫作灌輸醫識的通俗文字，關係於取材的重要，已如上述，然題材之外的文字技巧方面，亦同樣地甚爲要緊。向民衆作灌輸宣傳的文字題材，雖然是採取了適合民衆口胃的題材，爲民衆所需要的絕好題材，要是寫作者的文字技巧不講究，不加以注意，寫出來的話語，不是過於專門化，便是過於機械化。却不能通俗化，普遍化，仍然難望其達到灌輸醫識這個目的，獲得宣傳醫識這個效果的。因爲題材雖然通俗化，若文字未曾通俗化，仍不能爲大衆所瞭解，爲大衆所懂得。好比烹調小菜，雖然小菜的本質，都是補身益體的資料，要是烹調不得其法，烹得太淡太鹹，就會失掉口味的；如其火工烹得不够，還未煮得熟透，吃到胃裏，便不易消化了。寫作醫識文字，亦復如是；雖題材適當，通俗，如其文字講解得不淸楚，欠漢顧，仍不易爲一般讀者所理解。旣不能理解，又如何望其獲益，望其獲得灌輸醫識文字的益處呢？所以我們在寫作此類醫識文時，應極力的遷就民衆，不以淺顯通俗爲不雅；遇到專門性的術語名詞，不妨多費一些言詞，去詳加解釋，務使其通俗化淺顯化而後已。一個不通俗的專門性的名詞，就費去數十字句去解釋，去說明，亦並不算過分，並不算冗長；因爲在替大衆灌轍發識，向民衆作醫識宣傳，並非在作八股文，也非在做四六文。</p>
<p>說是要做灌輸宣傳的醫識文字，非但題材要切合民衆所需要，而且文字的述說講解，更應爲民衆所理解的通俗化普通化，但實際上做起來，亦並不比寫作專門性的學術文章容易多少。更切實地說：要眞正寫作題材旣爲民衆所適口的題材，文字又能明白淺顯生動而有勁的通俗文字，說不定比寫作一般專門性的醫學文字，更加費心耗力，更加麻煩點兒哩。</p>
<p>然要眞正的寫作以灌輸醫識爲目的的通俗文字，却還要看各人的手筆技巧，各人的天資才分，隨各人的技巧才分的不同，而定其文字方式的各異。或者更明白地說：各個人有各個人的寫作醫識的文字方式的；這兒所謂灌輸醫學常識的方式；祗不過在原則上，或大體上如此這般的提出說說就是了。</p>
<h3>葡萄糖酸鈣與丙維他命　混合之研究及其對於生體之作用</h3>
<p>— 吳果誠</p>
<p>頃閱讀本刋第十期沈松年先生所著之「葡萄糖酸鈣」一文，並見編者之附言，以葡萄糖酸鈣與丙維他命，於注射器內混合，是否起化學變化，而不能決定，今以余所實騐之結果及其於化學上變化關係，作通俗之略述：</p>
<p>凡具有初步的有機化學知識者，均知葡萄糖酸（Glucosieacid）與丙維他命（Vitamin—c＝1—ascorbieacid）均爲一極弱之有機酸，鈣爲弱碱性之物，以比三物，同入一水液中所成之物，如鈣有足量或過量之時，當爲兩者之鈣鹽，如鈣量不足，若決定成爲何種鈣鹽，當由此兩種酸與鈣之結合力而定，但所成之盟，不論其爲何種鈣鹽，入於生體內是否有効，當由其所成之鹽的情形而定；如所成者爲水溶性，具離子化，入於生體內，均有効，反之，如生成之鈣鹽爲不溶性，或雖可溶而爲一種化學上的所謂的分子內化合物，仍然無効或其効極小，不堪應用。因分子內化物，於水中不生成鈣離子，不參與普通化學變化，失郤鈣之性能，故先決條件爲決定是否爲分子內化合物。今余以兩種鈣鹽分別及混和加入草酸試之，均生草酸鈣沉澱，足可證明非分子內化合物。故不諭爲何種鈣鹽，入於生體內，均有効能。</p>
<p>至於丙維他命於生體內可溶解鈣之一說，似乎欠科學根據，因爲宋國賓先生認爲酸貿有溶解鈣之能力，是則丙維他命入於體內必使血液成爲酸性始有此作用，然人體之血液爲弱碱性，在化學上爲PH．7．35。（PH．7爲中性7以上爲碱性，以下爲酸性），反觀供注射用之丙維他命均爲調整至PH．6．8左右之溶液（普通之液爲百分之五之丙維他命），此種酸度極弱之丙維他命液，即用至一萬國際單位，亦不過含〇·五克丙維他命，以此微量而極弱之酸性，欲搖動血液成爲酸性，根本不可能。何况生體尚有控制調節之機能，如使血成酸性，也即刻成酸毒症（酸性血液症）了，因此丙維他命於生體中，決無溶解鈣質之可能。</p>
<p>於葡萄糖酸鈣或鈣以及葡萄糖酸是否有破壞丙維他命之可能，當爲可慮之事，如能，則此兩物混合，仍屬不合理。余用此三者（葡萄糖酸，葡萄糖酸鈣，及氫氧化鈣），分別混溶於丙維他命之中，放置兩小時之久，用二氣酚吲　酚（2．6　Dichlorphenol－indolphenol）試驗丙維他命，證明毫不被破壞。</p>
<p>關於「纎維性結核患者體中之鈣質已達飽和」一語，似並非如沈松年先生所言，一定要成石膏人才算是飽和，因人體中須要一定量之鈣，達此需要量，稱爲飽和，如鈣過多，必由泌尿器排出，但如有特殊情形則例外，如結核病者之需要過飽和鈣而骨石灰沉着症之已爲過飽和。至於高年患有血管硬化症或骨石灰沉着症者，其體內之鈣似已達飽和，無庸再用鈣劑，如果並無此症則鈣之需要當爲合理要求，然雖有血管硬化症或骨石灰沉着症之結核患者，其病灶需要補充鈣時，當酌用之，正如沈先生所說不可因噎廢食。</p>
<p>余本互相探討學術之精神，敢質之宋沈兩位先生以爲如何？</p>
<h3>瘋犬病淺說（續完）</h3>
<p>— 陳金斗</p>
<p>經過了一個或畏或短的潛伏期之後，就開始起病，有發熱，食慾不振，腹痛，失眠，燥急，易怒，四肢震顫等症狀，傷在頭面部的，常有連續不斷的噴嚏，這個階段，大約要經過三四天，是謂憂鬰期（MelancholischeStadium），此時在咬嚙傷口的周圍，淋巴腫脹，灼熱疼痛。</p>
<p>接下去就要發生搐搦，精神錯亂，唾液分泌增多，呼吸道和咽頭吞嚥的肌肉，常起痙攣，因而呼吸不整，嚥下困難，煩渴殊甚，却不能下飲滴水，患者旣喘且渴，非常痛苦，前面提起的見到水液或想起飲喝而起痙　的恐水現象，就在此時發現，所以這一期就稱爲恐水期（Hyorophobie　Stadium）</p>
<p>後來，精神上漸形興奮，甚至更進展而發狂，五官器神經的反射機能亢進；雖是非常乾渴，而唾液的分泌更加旺盛，脈搏細小不勻，體溫更高，可升至四十三度以上，這個時期稱之爲癲狂期（Maniakalsche　Stadium），實際上恐水期和癲狂期，不容易分得淸楚，這二期合併着發作，可有二三天至四五天之久。</p>
<p>迨　狂期之發作，已離死不遠，但在臨死之前，再有一個麻痺期（Paralytische　Stadium），此時痙攣和搐　都能停止，患者可能飲食，似乎有好轉的現象，其實，這就是告訴你他待不到明後天就要長眠九泉去了；因爲那時他已經是飢渴交併，全身疲乏，心臟衰弱，不可以再延持其生命矣，</p>
<p>上以的分期是人爲的，發病的症狀，不會這樣眞有明確的分期，至少有些參前落後，但也不致相差太遠；惟有一種所謂靜瘋（Stille　Wut），一開頭就是發作麻痺的症象，則病勢尤見猛劇，二三天就可致死的。</p>
<p>一旦不幸而遭受到瘋犬病之後，想內服藥劑以救命，正好比一般患了赫尼亞（俗稱腸疝氣），想光靠內服藥以根治的觀念一樣，都是錯誤而沒有希望的，一經發作的瘋犬病患者，不免一死，傷口局部趕早用强烈的消毒殺菌藥物，或燙蝕挖除的方法，不能信以爲就可把病毒完全撲滅，不過是可能延長其潛伏期而已，甚至將咬傷部的一段肢體截割掉，也不是頂有把握的療法，所以除了當時傷口局部施以此種緊急揹置之外，最要緊的步驟，在乎觀察來犯害的動物，是否確有瘋病？倘確實證明牠是瘋獸，或者來犯害的動物無從查究，那麼被咬嚙的人，必須趕速行巴士德（Pasteur）瘋犬病疫苗的接種療法，以拯救其生命，疫苗的如何施用，因爲限於篇幅，恕從略不敍。</p>
<p>假使一隻狗來犯害咬嚙，旣被咬傷了，却不可以逞一時之火，把牠打死以洩怒，並不是說要大國民風度的以德報怨，除非能證明來犯害的狗確實是瘋犬，否則應該把牠拘捕起來，嚴密地監視，看牠有沒有瘋狗的徵象；倘在二星期之內始終是正常的生活着，那麼被牠咬嚙的人，就可放心，不會咸染到瘋犬毒的，也就不必去接種瘋犬病疫苗，曾經發現過極少數的人，注射了瘋犬病疫苗之後，發生極嚴重的致命的麻痺症；這個麻痺症的發生，並不是由於注射了所發生的反應，而是他個人對於兎腦脊髓的過敏性，（瘋犬病疫苗的原料是兎的腦脊髓），可是這一點提防，根本不足以勸戒確被瘋默咬嚙而感染到瘋犬毒的人的接種防治，我再強調的說一句二確被瘋獸咬傷的人，爲了要保全共生命起見，應該毋庸猶豫地趕速去注射瘋犬病疫苗，而且是愈早愈好！</p>
<p>瘋犬的認識，也是一件很重要的事，下面就把瘋犬的一般情態，描寫一下，瘋犬發病，最初的徵候，就是發現牠氣質上發生　性，本來是馴服和順的，要變得慍怒，險沉，恐怖，膽小，企圖隱遁，厭避食物，運動遲緩，吠聲嘶嗄不爽，但也有變得異常親熱，倍形可愛，不願離開主人，善舐手足的。隔了一二天，更變得浮躁，彷徨，來往徘徊，騷動不安，不能保持平靜，但尚能聽命指揮，還不致咬嚙侵害。再進展下去，變得失其馴度，露齒咆哮，恫嚇吠嗥，好像是威嚴地自衛，但仔細觀察並無發威的對象，不過是虛空無目的地暴躁，有時發現牠的眼睛發紅，亂跑亂跳，追逐家禽家畜，倘是畜飼在家中，幽禁在室內的，牠變得激動地發出搔把抓撕的舉止，或翻動其窠穴磨嚙傢俱，喜嚙食土塊木片等物，亦易嚙人，倘是放縱散養的狗，牠就要離家遠游，沒有目的地的邂逅外旅，牠並不是存心出去闖禍肇事，實際上牠還是懦怯地逢人遠避，不敢近趨，牙關緊強，口不能閉闔，流涎伸舌，尾巴下　，但遇着敵對阻難的時候，就要無情地咬嚙，瘋犬也有恐水症象，不能飲食，漸形消瘦憔悴，牠將要接近死亡的時候，仍會動蕩無常地摸索探路，尋回家來，終至麻痺靜臥而死，瘋狗發病的過程中，有時像有骨片梗塞在牠咽頭，進退二難的表示出一副異常難受的表情來着實會使你不忍卒睹，要同情地沒法使牠解困，可是這個好人萬萬做不得，不獨終是無助於狗，反而會誤害了你自已的生命！</p>
<p>預防勝於治療，任何疾病都脫不掉這一個原則，不祗醫事職業的人，應該負起宣導的天職，每一個人都應該瞭解道個道理，對於瘋犬尤宜愼乎預防之道。</p>
<p>瘋犬四季可見，隨時都有遭殃的危機，普通以春夏二季較爲多見人患，因爲天氣暖和，不論男女老少，都不願蟄居室內，喜歡戶外散步，或徜徉街頭，尤其當此淸明時節，春假期間，多作鄉郊踏靑，樂游芳草，不就增加了與野痴狗接觸的機會嗎？所以希望你們都謹愼防範，不要罹受其厄，敗興而歸。</p>
<p>至於公衆預防的方法，莫非着眼在狗身上，撲滅了病根的瘋犬，人患當然可以滅少，甚至絕滅，茲擬數端，共付討論。</p>
<p>第一，捕捉野犬：凡是無主領受的狗，都是飼食不周，毛身不潔，散蕩街頭，聳毛撒糞，旣　觀瞻，又害衛生，即使沒有瘋病之慮，亦應捕捉取締，現警察局當有補狗車出現於馬路，進行此事，確是賢明措施。</p>
<p>第二，養犬課以重稅：狗能夜守看門固宜飼養利用，但有瘋病之虞，所以未便獎勵養育。</p>
<p>第三，使用口罩：這一點犬主每多忽略，戴用口罩之後，即使沒有提防到牠的發瘋，也不能逞其咬嚙之禍，輕而易舉，深望犬主倡導之。</p>
<p>第四，預防注射，旣可防止狗本身發病，又能澈底剷除人得病的原因，希望衛生當局，注意及此。</p>

<h3>這些天</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>這些天，在物質和精神的雙層壓迫下，我病了！</p>
<p>病中我不吃藥，不　下，不出門，不見客。我支持着像一個好人一樣的工作着，我殘酷地欺騙着自己。</p>
<p>窮，我可以忍；身體不健康，我可以追補；唯獨情緒崩潰，我痛苦！</p>
<p>情緒不好，固然是由貧病而來，但也是受許多客觀刺激所影響。譬如：你不願做的事情，別人硬逼你做；你明明沒犯什麼過錯，別人硬責難你犯了過錯；你走的路很正，別人却駡你走歪了；你想安分，別人不呌你安分；你本來安分，別人偏說你不安分；你願爲自己活着，別人要讓你爲他話着；你處處替別人作嫁了，別人還嫌不够；………這一切，都足以使你瘋狂，使你茫茫然不知所措！</p>
<p>這期間，我曾對整個宇宙發生懷疑，我咀咒它的生，滅律沒有循着一個善惡的準繩進行，因此眞理無從發現，正氣無從樹立！我也曾憎恨整個的人類，我感覺人與人之間太自私；太陰謀；太缺乏崇高的情操和信義！於是，我惱怒過，我想扭轉這個慘局，但我的力量太薄弱了，我便只有悲哀！</p>
<p>終於，我苦思窮究，好容易從這個亂世的風雲裏覓着一個聊以心安理得的生活方式，我企圖逐漸超脫自己，我用絕對的靜和沉默鎭定心，靈，我努力培養着宗敎的精神，我是這機開始打發着我的日子———</p>
<p>照例，我最早十點鐘才能起來，這樣可以縮短我所僧厭的白天光陰。</p>
<p>盥浣已畢，走進我的四舖席大小的書齋，第一件事便是在我的寫字台上點着一柱香，我並不拜佛也不唸經，我只靜靜地坐在案前，從那裊裊靑烟中透視我自己，當我發現我還有血，有肉，有思想，有情感，有心，有靈魂的時候，我笑了！因爲我欣慰我底一切還活着，在昨委的假死——你睡着了就是假死——要，我底一切都沒有損失。也許即是所謂「無爲有處有還無」！</p>
<p>我楞瞅着靑烟化爲了雲，化爲了霧，然後我推開窗子，讓一股淸風吹散了雲，吹散了霧，又化爲了氣，我便吸進它，再呼出去，於是空虛與岑寂襲上來，我收歛了！</p>
<p>我沉點地拿起筆，我忠誠地把一張張白稿紙塗滿了我底血；我底肉；我底思想；我底情感；我底心；我底靈魂！我是那樣純眞地表現了我底一切，不爲別的，不爲換取人的瞭解；不爲出賣後的報酬；只爲向自己證實還知冷，暖，還辨是，非；還識羞，惡，還能愛，恨！</p>
<p>於是這一天的時間在我的筆下，飄飄然飛去了三分之二。黃昏遮住了我的光，朦朧了我的眼睛，我便擱下筆，把幾盆鮮花搬到三樓凉台上去準備吸收夜晚的露水。再走到院子裏觀賞缸裏的金魚，我義慕那羣悠悠，游泳不息於綠油油的永裏的紅紅黑黑的小動物，牠們是恁麼自由，和平，瀟洒，安樂！牠們從不關心缸外面的世界，牠們視缸外面的世界如地獄，所以牠們寗肯老死在牠們的小宇宙裏而絕不願邁出缸外面一步，牠們不屑於與缸外面的人類——牠們看作魔鬼——爲伍—因此，我羞於過分的接近牠們，我尊重牠們的風箏！</p>
<p>我該出去散步了。我走到山陰路的盡頭，徜徉於一排無名的樹下，默默踏着落葉數着，我自己的脚印　偶然，我也仰首眺望那廣漠的天空，我底心有時會跟着行雪賽跑，我底靈魂會向星星飛眼！如果有月亮，我會找一片乾凈土坐下來，或者是躺倒了，我讓月光抱着我，我吻月光，用我全部的熱情，全部的愛。</p>
<p>夜送我再回到小樓，回到書齊，回到那張像虎口似的椅子上。</p>
<p>我再拿起筆，繼續寫着「未完」的文字，香烟頭已經堆砌成了一座崎嶇的小山了，四週再沒有人聲，物聲了，我便沏上一蓋碗最熱的淸茶，也許還斟上一杯酒—黃龍，或綠豆燒—慢慢地飲着，爲了洗滌澄淸一下這一天的疲勞，這一天的塵垢。同時，我用牙牌「過關」；「斬將」；拿寳」；「卜卦」；爲了我要排還這一天的煩惱；發澳這一天的情感；雖然，我永遠過不完的「難關」；斬不了一個魔「將」；拿不到半個金「寳」；卜的盡是下下「卦」。</p>
<p>茶，酒乾了，我便打開一本唐宋詩文集來讀着，我要學學古人是怎樣寫出他們的血，肉，思想，情感，心，靈魂？結果，我從杜甫的詩裏，李淸照的詞裏，杜光廷（所着「虬髯客傳」）和樂史（所着「長恨傳」）的小說裏，我只看見眞，純厚的「眞」；美，高潔的「美」，善，淵傳的善！然而我却「學」不來，儘管我有這志向。</p>
<p>長後，我需要休憩了，像平起一樣，盥洗已學，我進了寢室，躺下來，閉上眼請，停止思潮的波動，只寗靜地傾聽夜，和夜作無聲的絮語，直至夢神把我牽到另一個虛幻的境界中去！</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 老凱</p>
<p>黑，草塲上的鳴綫似乎在爲春天　着葬歌，又似乎在惱怒着春天的歸去。</p>
<p>路燈用睦睡的眼睛，盯視着那幾株綠得發黑的法國梧桐，顯然是爲了她們的業已消逝的處女時代而深深惋惜。</p>
<p>到處都吐露出初夏的情調了，尤其是在這落雨的夜晚。</p>
<p>我一個人坐在桌旁，時而看看窗外，時而把思想沈入雨滴濕和錢的攏聲裏。鷄啼過第一遍，依然沒有一絲睡意。</p>
<p>從紙烟的藍色的雲霧中，忽然想起小提琴，前些日子，不是可聽到來自隔壁的小提琴的悲訴嗎？</p>
<p>然面，這位音樂愛好者已於昨天攙着他的琴走向遠方。爲了失去他和那憂　的聲響，我感到如同失去一個愛人的那樣迷惘而敗興。</p>
<p>手邊寂寞地躺着本陀斯妥也夫斯基的小說，翻開來，讓慘　的燈光映出其中的被侮辱與被損害者的悽哀的臉孔，悲慘的遭際。這之間，淚點竟偸偸擠出我的眼角，我想着，我們的現實是和他們的並無異致，</p>
<p>我站起來，用沉重的步伐　　着，地板在脚下發出　聲。創痛的感情　蝕着我，　濕的夜氣襲擊着我，而找，却並不感到孤獨，也並不爲了沉悶遂乃跨進哀　的霧　。</p>
<p>我有着頗為美麗的怚　——披起詩琴，起向那一望無際的新生的草原；或者，　了泥汚的手杖，行進在四無人烟的壯　的沙漠，那時，即使風砂打得我周身血蘭，利石　破我的脚趾，我也將倔强地導笑着，我也將殺開宇宙的　子？，透口古英維的呼吸。</p>
<p>鷄啼漸漸多起來，遠　，轟　着獨輪車的　聲和勞　者的歌唱，敲碎了周遭的死一般的寂靜</p>
<p>我知道：這是殘夜將盡的時分了。連忙對　外投去延宕的深望——</p>
<p>東邊的天角綻破一條銀痕，黎明正駑着紅色的車子從這銀痕上滾來。</p>
<p>我知道：殘夜快要死滅，連忙挾捺住心的跳躍，傾聰着，並仔細辨認着：</p>
<p>哪是黎明的脚步，哪是樹葉上的雨的疲倦的嘆息。</p>
<h3>汪亞塵先生個展</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>地點：南京西路成都路口國畫苑：</p>
<p>時間：五月十五日至二十一日。</p>
<p>我想爲亞　兄題一個別號：「汪金魚」！其實這個別號在十餘年前早就成立了，今日不過舊事重提而已。爲什麼呢？論畫，各有專長：悲鴻的馬，大千的荷，書旗的孔雀，善　的老虎，抱石，君壁的山水，少昂的蟬，春苔的菊，………以及亞塵的魚。畫和文章一樣，各有各的個性。一位畫家，猶如一位文學家，必須有自己的，獨特的作風；要使一位觀客，或一位讀者，不看署名，單看作品，就猜準作者是誰。有個性，不一定說作品有價値；但是，決無沒有個性的作品而有價値的道理。亞塵的畫，亞塵畫的魚，尤其是亞塵畫金的魚，混在別人的作品裏，我雖患近視，可以辨別出來，大概十不離八九。</p>
<p>從前趙松雪繪馬，爬在地上舉倣馬的姿勢。我不知道亞塵有無定做一隻特大的金魚缸？也許他曾請君立夫人裝做金魚，他從旁而繪之。總而言之，咱們這位無錫毛脚女婿，當他每年暑假，到無錫去當駙馬時，必去欣賞數百缸的金魚，目奪神移，了然胸中，然後施之於筆墨。</p>
<p>「子非魚，安知魚之樂？」我非往亞　，却知亞　繪魚之樂！第一，見物思情，他繪魚在紙，繪君立在心；第二，他的個性，溫文而雅，頗像魚，——天哪，我指的是金魚，而非鰐魚！我敎次面對亞塵而立，靜觀他繪金魚：入神時，眉睫鼻尖都動；——猶如大仲馬寫小說，寫到得勁處，捧腹大笑（旣要「捧腹」，當然暫時擱筆不寫了），寫得傷心時，也會為之放聲一哭。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，亞塵杜門謝客，努力作　，欣賞金魚。當然。他的畫的範圍並不限於金魚，一切花卉翎毛都繪。他在書法方面，也下過苦功。這次的畫展，如果我記憶不錯，是勝利後第一次，也是沈　了多年後的第一次：養精蓄銳，必然大有可觀。</p>
<p>如果讀者小姐或先生，賜閱了我這篇一魚文」之後，無動於中，不去觀亞塵所繪的魚，尤其是金魚，以及其它：那麽，我將爲她或他惋惜失去一次難得的　梁之樂！</p>
<h3>群雛</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<h3>多馬士摩亞</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>英文國藝復興的鼻祖，小說「烏托邦」的著者，多馬士·摩亞（Thomas　Moore，1475－1535），才藝淹博，志行高潔，觸亭利王的忌諱，被處死刑。當他上斷頭合的時候，依然談笑自若，對　子手笑着說：『這口鬍子並沒有什麽罪，跟我一齊斬斷，豈不可惜？』說罷就用手掀起美髯，引頸就　。</p>
<h3>門</h3>
<p>— 莎蕾</p>
<p>在我的意識裏時常呈現着一扇門，傘屬體一探發着光，金屬物一樣地給人以沉重的感覺；在那扇門的四周，都蒸騰着雲霧氣，有時好像很貼近，有時又像非常遙遠。</p>
<p>在我歡樂的瞬間或寂寞的時刻裏，那扇門時當像被一輛軍子迅速地推到我面前，又立時隱去了。</p>
<p>這是怎樣的預兆和秘密呢？門的內面是一方狹窄的囚室還是展開着廣大的空間？從那面將會伸出一隻魔手或是流出無量的珍寳來？</p>
<p>我一點也不能臆測，我好奇地以意識中的眼注視着它，我渴想知道它的內容，可是我從來沒有企圖去撫觸或開啓它。</p>
<p>今天的午睡裏我不自覺地走進一座殿堂，在那面，各種奇異的臉譜發出各種不同的樂器的音響，而那些透明的活柱裏時而噴出火熖，時而漾着淸泉，我感到這過於廣大幽深的所在充滿了恐怖的氣氛；當我大聲地呼喊着，我不知怎樣已站立在門外。</p>
<p>那扇門正是我朝夕相逢的故人，它仍是那樣地輝煌，莊重。蒸着熱氣。彷彿說：</p>
<p>『你啊，孩子，你只配遠凝視着我。』</p>
<p>我忍受不了那揶揄，我以全生命的憤怒猛烈地推開它，在一陣山崩地裂的巨響中我却醒來了</p>
<p>我此刻又回到了人間，坐在活生生的現實裏，我幾次想在意識裏再構成那們的形象而已不可能了，呈現出來的只是一片白茫茫的霧，夾雜一圈强烈的火光，似乎是屬於星雲時代的一個最原始的景色。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「哦…！這是第三個「哦」了。惠心而論，鶴見這時，眞也不知道應該語甚　話，才合情理。就連不合情理的話，也想不起一句來；爲的是這位小姐說話只顧息己發言，說　，就把大門關上，呌人　有挿口的餘地。</p>
<p>「不過我想…我的時間有限」，這　色的口氣　了；好像做文章一樣，用「不過」兩字，　開下文。「又不知道我哥哥什麽時候再來，　竟許不來；所以…」這　，　又露出　白整齊的一口牙齒，加上　　上兩　滴　潤地小酒窩，嘻嘻地一笑，「所以我　還是同　　接談談罷…」！　也不　鸛見　觀，不歡迎自　自從鶴見　　，白　他　　　一閃，濫了室內。</p>
<p>「　　不是　　嗎」！　見一　銀着她走進室內，一　心下想着，「旣要直接談話，早就應該說明，豈不結了？何必又費許多張致」？</p>
<p>「很好，小姐請坐」。鶴見沒有把室們隨手關上。在鶴見心上，當然沒有「男女授受不親」的觀念，更用不着保守談話的秘密。至於爲什麼把門讓牠開着，也許是希望這位摩小姐，三言兩語把話說完，趕快請出，省却開門關門的手續？</p>
<p>「我想這門還是關上的好，行嗎？」話雖是這們問，她也不管主權不主權，走過去就把室門「砰」地　上了；一回身大刺刺地揀了一把靠窗口的小沙發，舒舒服服的坐下了。剛才落座，就仰起臉來：</p>
<p>「我想請敎您一句話，古先生…」</p>
<p>「哦…」！鶴見還沒來得及坐下，「您請賜敎罷…」鶴見眞也毫無辦法，只希望她快些「賜敎」，快些走路。</p>
<p>「賜敎？…客氣客氣…！我先請敎一件小事，！您這兒想必也現成有一柄手槍？不管什麽一類的，只要是手槍」。話是問得這麽奇突，神色上却又那麽輕措淡寫地。</p>
<p>見聽了這一問，當然不免一愕；委實不懂牠這一問，究竟是個什麽動機，什麽用意；至於什麼道理，更加說不上了。</p>
<p>「手槍嗎？…」</p>
<p>「對哪…吿訴您明白一些；我想用手槍試騐一件事」。</p>
<p>人在窘到極度的當口，有時可能觸發一股橫勁，這股橫勁的觸發，有時需要對方撥動，有時也可自動爆發。况且鶴見並非　種，也非無能之輩。這時所以窘住，無非當時心境不佳，碰着這位小姐突如其來，出塲的姿態又是那們奇特，同時，鶴見的毛病，老是在維特他一貫的「紳士」風度，寗可自己受些委屈，也不願失禮於人，尤其是一位女子，更尤其是一位像當初耀羣一般的一位少女。但被抑壓着的一股橫勁是有限度的。</p>
<h3>交大學生的「實習」</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>交大學生日前請願，其中機械系四年級學生，曾於車庫中自行　開火車頭一　，並加拖二十七節臥車，準備裝戰全體同學赴京。據次日報紙的報奪，這些高班學生經數度試車，終於在半小時以後，於鳴鳴汽笛聲中，將列車再　開動。「火車由　而疾，很自然也很平穩。駕駛技衛，出乎估計之外」。此次精願的是非成敗，筆者不欲有所　列，然而在這一片混亂現象之中，看到大學學生竟能自行駕駛火車，而且技衛相當不差，終覺這些機械某學生還沒有事負　家　給予他們的敎育，而交大在這方面的實用敎育也可以令人榮觀了。</p>
<p>在晚報上面，這件事就有了更詳細的叙述。據說王四　學　　的學生，坐在火車頭內，因爲「從無駕駛經騐，故初開時頗感困難」，若干疑難，必須請求姑上工人解　，當ｊｆ　雖然弄得滿臉滿手的煤屑，「而仍不順利」。於此可見這些學生平日並無實習駕駛的機會，倘然沒有這次的請願，也許水遠不會有什麽機會，這些學生討於這）門是否專攻，我們不知道，如果是的，那末他們的缺乏實習便是一件憾事了。</p>
<p>然而在站上工人拒絕解釋以後，在極種困難勉強克服以後，火車畢免是被他們開動了，這一次的實習，其價值已遠勝於他們　本上和敎室裏的講授。（假如他們是專攻這一門的話）同屬實習的用處，也在這裏充分表現了出來。</p>
<p>不管如何，交大學生此次在北站的活動，除了最後內部的一點糾紛以外，其工作的分配，行動的指揮，都顯示出過去學生活動之中少見的效率，於此可見他們平日所受的科學敎育，實在並沒有　空。這在社會上一般人士看來，總算是不幸之中可喜的現象。</p>
<p>然而這一切所表現出來的，究竟祗是一種技術，技術是重要的，更重要的是操縱技術的方針，對於大舉生從敎育所得到的成就，我們看到一點一滴都萬分喜歡，可是我們也衷心希望他們能善用這份可貴的成就。</p>

<h3>太原之憶</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>從北邊來的，氈帽上蒙着一層黃沙的塞外客商，從東面太行山溜下來的鄕巴佬，和從晋南沃田裏沾滿一身麥棉香氣走來的老粗們，當他們第一次路出嘈雜熙攘的太原車站，抬眼看到那一脈莊嚴雄偉的城樓雉媒時，乃不禁異口同聲地　南了：「這是一座大城」。</p>
<p>但在城門外附近的地方，却一窩蜂似的蠶集着若干露天小麵館，在那一列列敵脚長凳上　湧着人頭　蒸霧；更有的是扯起了布篷的津漢百貨攤子；和挑擔子穿梭往來的行商小販，以及手工擊製售者；這對那些人都不是陌生的；而這大城也立刻爲三晋人民所愛護了。</p>
<p>記憶中有一個恬美的夏夜，我一個人沿着新南門大街的寬坦馬路，綫緩地向城市的心臟　去；我訝異於這城市打烊過早的店肆；除了一　一　稀疏的　燈外，迎接我的只有點着麻油燈盞的街頭小食販；有賣八寳粥，老糟蛋的；有　　肉煌餅的；也有油茶，湯圓之類。注目於那些熊熊的慧人親熱的零星燈火，我又一吹沈緬於山鄕故宅中久經消逝時</p>
<p>在春天，正是太原城風沙的季節；樹木是稀少的，乾巴巴的土地上難得有可喜的綠色；從城牆望出去嗎？除了達山，還是遠山。但在晴朗的日子裏，有一羣羣南來燕子，呢喃啐呌着穿過烟囱吐出的靑霧，向天邊掠去；我想着：這陣子江南必已是鶯飛草長了。</p>
<p>想不到六年後的今天我來在江南，而太原却淪於草木驚心的地步；遙念團城風雨，無怪我憂心如搗呵。</p>
<h3>幸而</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>家兄病得很重，因此我們請了趙醫生，家兄吃了他的藥，病勢反而加重。於是我們請了錢醫生，家兄吃了他的藥，病勢格外兇險起來，我們覺得沒希有望了。又去請了孫醫生。孫醫生太忙了，沒有空來。家兄的病果然好了。</p>
<p>新知識</p>
<h3>人力與馬力</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>機器的大小，都以馬力計算，據大英百科全書所載，一匹馬力，等於每分鐘三萬三千呎磅，一個人力所能做的，祇及其十分之一；所以一匹馬力，等於十個人力，已經著爲定例，不特普通人及大學生相信以上所說的爲準確，即一般工程師亦以爲然。但是斯丹曼慈博士計算出來，一偶人力祗等於三十三瓦，有些工作如鏟泥土等，一個人力祗等於十五瓦。在肯特氏機械手册中所載，蘭金氏在蘇格蘭，曾經實地測騐，一個人空手在樓梯上走上走下，八個鐘點，共費二百零五萬九千二百呎磅，其他抽水抬物敲釘推小車，各各不同，平均爲每一人力等於三十五瓦。最近美國友寗大學敎授吳而德氏，曾在中國作種種測騐，如挑水，背　，抬磚及　水等，平均每一人力等於三十一瓦，根據以上實測所得，一匹馬力，至少須等於二十個人力，十人一馬之說，不攻自破矣。</p>
<h3>良心的破產者</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>中央大學敎授會日前發表宣言，痛陳當前社會，文化之危機，其中有一段話說得極沉痛：</p>
<p>「目前種種不合理不公平之情影，迫使奉公守法淸　　　的人才，如果不願隨渡逐流，只有衣食不足，勞心焦思，疾病無醫，甚至死亡，這是國家人才的戕賊輿反淘汰。」</p>
<p>社會風氣日趨反常，長此以往，一般人終於將誤以爲反當倒是正常了。習俗移人，無可抗拒，一切的道德敎條均不足以與習俗相抗。比如說，赤手空拳上任的縣長，下台後若沒有十幾挑行李以壯行色，他的親戚朋友將把他看爲何等人？——不是說他本傾大，手脚乾淨；就設他準是個白　。以目前縣政人員的待遇而論，當局不是在等於鼓勵各人自行設法開闢財源麽？年前浙省某縣長上任時，自撰對聯一付云：</p>
<p>「捧着一果心來；</p>
<p>不帶一根草去。」</p>
<p>耿耿此心，令人嚮往，然而淸官畢竟不容易做，一個縣長對來來去支瓣大員的執行費，也早已超過驚任人員收入的好多倍了；而且依照封建社會的敎條說，「一人得道，鷄大昇天」，某縣長除了自己的生活問題外，也得照顧一下親戚朋友才是，所以等他一下台，滿滿地載走了三船行李以後，當地的士紳就聯名吿了他一狀，而且還有好事者爲他的那付「名聯」續了兩句，日：</p>
<p>「捧着一顆心來——存心搜括；</p>
<p>不帶一根車去——有何用？」</p>
<p>這故事如今流傳於浙江各地，將來有人續寫「在官法戒　」的話，大約是不會遺忘了這個故事的。在中國，存心想做一個好父母官的人一定不少吧，也許當初確曾立過大志——「捧着一顆心來，不帶一根草去」，然而時間一久，「習俗最雄辯，他們絡於只好向「貪汚」投降了。</p>
<p>巴瀾扎克說得好：</p>
<p>「我們的心是一座寶摩，一下子倒空了，你就得破產聖」</p>
<p>在這樣的世風下，有多少人能够始終保持他的堅貞如保守他的財庫一樣呢？又有多少人在習俗的影響下，一下子變成了良心的破產者！？</p>
<h3>紀曉嵐的幽默</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>淸紀曉嵐幽默成性。　官野史，關於他的戲謔事傳　頗多。如「昔曾相府拜乾娘，今日乾爺又姓梁，赫奕門楣新吏部，凄凉池館舊中堂。君如有意應憐妾，奴豈無顏只爲郎，百八牟尼親手捧，探來猶帶乳花香。」一詩，即出自紀的手筆，用以譏諷號稱「三姓門生」的某探花者。</p>
<p>紀不僅作詩諷刻如此，而且屬對尤爲天才，信手拈來，語妙如珠。如陸耳山一日訪紀云：「適飲馬四吸井，四眼井以何爲對？」他回答道：「即以閣下對，如何？」使陸捧腹不置。又如「乾隆間，工署火，有人出對云：「水部火災，金司空大興土木，」適紀文達入廟，有中書某，狀甚魁梧，自負爲南人北相，輾然曰：「南人北相，中書科甚麽東西。」其風趣往往類此。</p>
<p>最詼諧是他嘗典某科會試，試　左右傳新科狀元劉王樹來謁。他請見後，首先即詢問寓居何處？劉以「芙蓉庵」對。紀聞此語，忽笑不可仰，旋退入內，久不能出。傳命劉暫歸府第，劉惴惴然莫名所以。他日再見，探其故，攙知道是日成一聯云：「劉玉樹小住芙蓉庵，潘金蓮大鬧葡萄架。」借用金瓶梅回目作下句，天衣無縫，屬對絕工，因是深自贊喜，中途送客，弄得他的門生丈二金剛換不着頭臘。</p>
<p>還有一則，亦極令人發笑，據巧對錄載云：「同人爲春　會，有以「太極兩儀生四象」命對者，適紀曉嵐至，同人的曰：「對訖始許入座。」公日：「春宵一刻值千金。」吾飢甚，無暇與諸公爭勝也·座客無不遇倒。」</p>
<p>此外，至於「老顯子」一事的洗傳，更屬膾炙人口，知者極多·此公幽默天才，誠非時下請求幽默所能企及的。</p>

<h3>懷太虛法師</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我和太虛法師是小同鄕，同是浙江崇德縣人·但我們相見很晚，是卅二三年間在重慶的長安寺裏第一次會面的。一見之後，我很親近他，因爲他雖然幼小離鄕，而嘴上操着一口順德土白，和我談話，很是入木。我每次入城，必然去長安寺望望他。那時我常常感到未見面時的太虛法師，與見面後的太虛法師，竟判若兩人。</p>
<p>未見面之前，我聽別人的傳說，甚是驚奇。有人說他是交際和尙·文有人說他是官僚和尙，還有人說他是出風頭和尙。我不相信，親去訪問他。一見之後，果然證明了外間的傳說都是誤解，他是正信，慈　，而又勇猛精遭的，眞芷的和尙·我這話決不是隨便說的，正信者，他對佛法有很正確的認識與信仰。慈悲者，他的態度中絕無貧嗔癡的痕跡。勇猛精進者，他對宏法事業有很大的熱心。眞正的和尙者，正信，慈　，勇猛精進之外，又恪守僧戒，數十年如一日，俱足比丘的資格。我每次訪問他之後，走出長安寺，下坡的時候，心中嘆嘆羨不置。我詫異：「崇德怎麼會出這樣的一個人」？</p>
<p>外間對他的誤解，實在是他的對世間的勇猛精進所招來的。凡對於佛法，佛教，寺院，佾人有利的事業，他都關心；不避艱　，不怕　煩，他都要盡心竭力去計劃，維持，或發起。凡和社會發生關係，總難免有招搖，議論，或謠論。太豦法師的受一部分人的誤解，全是他的議法的熱心所招來的。但他對於這些誤解，絕不關心，始終勇猛精　，直到圖寂。</p>
<p>我在重慶與太虛法　最後的會　，是復員前幾天在紫竹林棄菜館。那天我請客，邀在家出家的七八位好友叙晤，作爲對重慶的惜別。我不能忘記的，是我幾乎敎他開了酒戒。紫竹林的酒杯與茶杯是同樣的。酒壺也就用茶壺。席上在家人都喝酒，而出家之中也有一二人喝酒。我不知道太虛法師喝不暍酒，敬他一杯，看他是否同弘傘法師一樣謝絕。大約他那時正和鄰席的人談得熱心，沒有注意我的敬酒，並不謝絕。我心中納罕：一太虛法舞不戒　的！」旣而獻　，太虛法師端起杯子，　量吸一口，連忙吐出，　突地說道：「　來是酒，我當是茶」。滿座大　起來。我到得十分抱歉，我有有　　這位老法　的罪過。倘換了印光法師，我說不業要大受呵斥。但太虛法師　　　之罰巳。太虛　師已經不在人斐了，這整抱歉　存在我的心頭。我只有說他往生極　，　　　　。（卅大年五月九日於杭州）</p>

<h3>Provisional Legislative Yuan Passes Amendments to Laws Regarding the Election and Recall of Legislators and Supervisors: Temporary Motion to Crack Down on Election Fraud</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] The draft amendments to the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators and Supervisors were passed during the 325th regular session on the morning of the 15th. It can be said that all kinds of constitutional laws and implementing regulations have been passed, except for a portion still pending reconsideration and some details requiring further study. Today's regular session was chaired by President Sun, with over a hundred legislators in attendance. The discussion began with the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, with Liu Keshu and others raising questions about the election methods for occupational representatives, advocating that elections should be conducted by district. Otherwise, they argued, occupational groups in border areas would suffer too much. Deng Hongye reminded occupational representatives not to allow the election to be manipulated by a few monopolistic occupational groups. Ultimately, it was resolved to delete Article 8, paragraph 3, and provide detailed regulations in the appendix to avoid various disputes. Next, the discussion turned to the writing format of ballots, with Cheng Yuanzhen and others believing that the circle-selection method would be convenient. President Sun also agreed with this view, and it was resolved to change the original draft's method of writing names to the circle-selection method. The entire case, consisting of 69 articles, was passed after about an hour of discussion.</p>
<p>Next, the Law on the Election of Supervisors was discussed. According to the Constitution, supervisors are elected by the provincial and municipal councils, Mongolian and Tibetan local councils, and overseas Chinese groups according to the quota stipulated in Article 91 of the Constitution. Their nature is different from that of legislators, and the process is also easier than the former. The entire article was passed after a brief discussion.</p>
<p>Legislator Quota and Electoral District Table Mostly Approved</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of legislator quota allocation and electoral district division, which has been of most concern to all parties, was brought up during the meeting. The following five types were resolved and passed today: (1) Table of legislator quota allocation and electoral district division for Jiangsu and 17 other provinces; (2) Table of legislator quota allocation for Mongolia; (3) Table of legislator quota allocation for Tibet; (4) Table of legislator quota allocation for legislators elected by various ethnic groups in border areas; (5) Table of legislator quota allocation for provinces and municipalities not divided by district. Among them, the legislator quota allocation for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan provinces and Tibet is still to be readjusted. The legislator quota allocation for occupational groups and overseas Chinese nationals is pending submission of tables by the relevant authorities for separate decision, and therefore was not presented.</p>
<p>The total number of legislators for provinces and municipalities is 622, elected from 114 districts. During the discussion, Sun Jiulu raised questions about whether Jintan in Jiangsu should be included in the first or second district. Legislators from Zhejiang and Hunan also raised opinions on the district division of their respective provinces. It was resolved that the district division issues for the aforementioned provinces would be decided after discussion by the legislators from those provinces. All other provinces passed without issue. Jiangsu Province has 63 counties and cities, with a population of (36,469,321) people, and should produce 38 legislators, elected from 7 districts. Among them, only Jintan County's affiliation to the first or second district has not been finalized. The names of the counties and cities belonging to each district are listed below: First District: Zhenjiang, Jurong, Danyang, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, etc., 11 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Zhenjiang. Second District: Wujin, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan (undetermined), etc., 7 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Wujin. Third District: Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, Qingpu, Jiading, Baoshan, Jinshan, Shanghai, Songjiang, Fengxian, Chuansha, Nanhui, Chongming, etc., 14 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Wuxian. Fourth District: Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Taixing, Jingjiang, etc., 6 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Nantong. Fifth District: Dongtai, Xinghua, Baoying, Taixian, Yangzhou, Funing, Yancheng, etc., 7 counties, electing 6 legislators, office located in Dongtai. Sixth District: Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Guanyun, Ganyu, Donghai, Shuyang, Lianyungang City, etc., 8 counties and cities, electing 4 legislators, office located in Huaiyin. Seventh District: Xuzhou City, Tongshan, Dangshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Tengxian, Suining, Siyang, Suqian, Peixian, etc., 10 counties and cities, electing 5 legislators, office located in Xuzhou City.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] During the meeting on the morning of the 15th, Jian Guansan made a temporary motion to separately formulate a "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud" to limit the occurrence of election fraud involving bribery. His reason was that with the constitution about to be implemented, various elections would officially begin. This is the harbinger of our implementation of democracy and is of great importance. Rumor has it that among the candidates, there are many fat-bellied merchants with overflowing wealth who are engaging in campaigning with their vast financial resources. The amount of money they have is counted in tons, which cannot be matched by those who are talented but have empty pockets. Jian pointed out that some estimate that the social expenses and entertainment expenses required to participate in the legislator election cannot be done without 30 million yuan. How can ordinary people afford it? In order to prevent the election from being monopolized by fat-bellied merchants in the future, it is necessary to formulate a separate law. Huang Tongchang and others expressed great support for this suggestion and mentioned that in addition to preventing bribery, behaviors that threaten with guns should also be strictly prevented. It was resolved at the meeting that the case would first be referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for study and then to the plenary session for discussion.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Key to Peace Talks: Whether or Not They Can Be Resumed Depends Entirely on the CCP's Thoughts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The newly appointed National Government Committee member Wang Chonghui yesterday issued an opinion on the brewing of the peace movement, saying that whether or not peace talks can be resumed depends entirely on the CCP's decision. The government has always believed that the door to peace has not been closed and hopes that peace can be achieved as soon as possible. The fact that the National Government Committee still reserves seats for the CCP shows that the government is sincere. Achieving peace cannot be achieved by one side's wishful thinking. The CCP must also be sincere in order for it to be realized.</p>
<h3>Legislators Call for Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Legislator Zhou Yizhi and 19 others submitted a temporary emergency motion to the general assembly on the 15th, calling for peace. Due to time constraints, the case was left for discussion at the next general assembly.</p>
<h3>Sun Liren and Zheng Dongguo Travel Together from Nanjing to Beiping</h3>
<p>Shangguan Leaves Tianjin, Xu Qian Arrives in Shenyang</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 15th] Sun Liren and Zheng Dongguo traveled together from Nanjing to Beiping on the 15th and will return to Shenyang on the 16th. Sun told reporters that he came here to preside over the memorial service for officers and soldiers of the New First Army, which is scheduled to be held on the 19th, the anniversary of the capture of Sipingjie last year. He also said that Chairman Chiang had a long talk with him last night. When reporters asked if he had a new appointment, Sun smiled and did not answer. He denied rumors that he was going to the United States.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Bureau, 15th] Shangguan Yunxiang left Tianjin by special train for Shenyang on the morning of the 15th and is scheduled to return to Tianjin in ten days.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Bureau, 15th] Liao Chairman Xu Qian returned to Shenyang from Beiping at 6 p.m. on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Philippine Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Sino-Philippine Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th] The Philippine Senate Foreign Relations Committee, although opposed by its chairman Francisco, finally agreed today to send the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty to the Senate for debate. All members of the committee, except Chairman Francisco, voted in favor.</p>
<h3>Students from Central University and Other Schools Gather at the Ministry of Education to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Students from Central University, together with students from the National Conservatory of Music and the Drama Academy, about 2,000 people in total, collectively went to the Ministry of Education to petition at 9 a.m. on the 15th. They held flags and slogans, and wrote on the walls along the way in chalk, mostly saying: "We demand minimum nutrition," "We want to eat our fill," etc. The order along the way was very good. After arriving at the Ministry, student representatives Wang Zhude and eight others met with Vice Minister Tian. The students demanded that the nutrition standard be raised and that the allowance for non-staple food be increased to 103,200 yuan. Vice Minister Tian explained that the public funding system was originally intended to subsidize the poor and the various difficulties that have been maintained by the Ministry of Education. He also said that the treatment has already been readjusted, and the allowance for non-staple food has been increased to 48,000 yuan, which, together with 2.3 dou of rice, will total nearly 100,000 yuan, which is higher than the food allowance for general public education personnel, and advised the students to return to school. The student representatives informed the students, who all expressed dissatisfaction and swarmed to see the Minister. Because of the crowd, the order was immediately chaotic, resulting in the breaking of several office windows. At 10:40, Dean Zhu arrived at the Ministry and immediately spoke to all the students from the crowd using a megaphone, generally saying the same points as Vice Minister Tian. He also said that if students demand such an increase in the allowance for non-staple food, not only would the Minister not agree, but the public would also hardly sympathize. The students did not get what they wanted and went to the Executive Yuan to petition. Vice President Wang Yunwu and Secretary-General Gan Naiguang replied to the students that raising the standard involves the national education funding budget and must be resolved through a meeting. However, they agreed that the allowance for non-staple food for the second half of this month could be advanced according to the new standard. The students stayed at the Yuan until about 5 p.m. before dispersing.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Deeply Hopes That Students Will Not Easily Believe Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education recently told reporters that there have been many causes for the recent disturbances in various schools, but most of them are due to someone spreading rumors, creating an unstable situation in the education community. Specifically, for example, the Ministry of Education has not made any decisions regarding the recent renaming of Jiaotong University and the merger of the Management College, as well as the rumor in the Shanghai medical community that the pharmacy school will be changed to a five-year system. The students concerned have taken action out of love for their schools, and events such as petitions have occurred. However, the Ministry of Education has conducted thorough research and consulted experts for any decision and will never act rashly. It is deeply hoped that students across the country will not easily believe rumors and will focus on their studies.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Session of the Third Plenary of the National Political Council Is Approaching: Councilors Begin to Register: Proposals for the General Assembly Are Divided into Seven Groups for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Registration for the Fourth Session of the Third Plenary of the National Political Council began on the 15th. Since 9 a.m., registration has been very enthusiastic. As of 6 p.m., 76 people have registered, including Qian Gonglai, Peng Gechen, Xirao Jiacuo, Tao Xuan, Wang Huamin, Yin Shuxian, Fan Yusui, Luo Heng, Yu Bin, and Kong Kang. After registration, the issue of accommodation will be handled. Those who are accommodated by the Council are required to stay at the Central Hotel, with four people sharing a room, otherwise they will receive a lump sum of 150,000 yuan. The meal allowance is 24,000 yuan per person per day, calculated for 20 days, totaling 480,000 yuan, which is received in a lump sum after registration. The Secretariat also recently notified that a tea party for all councilors will be held at 3 p.m. on the 19th to exchange opinions, and the opening ceremony of this general assembly may be re-examined. A final session of the Resident Committee will be held on the morning of the 17th to approve the work report of the Resident Committee and conclude all matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman of the Presidium of the National Political Council Zhang Boling arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 15th. Zhang's spirit is vigorous, and his health is even better than when he returned from the United States last time.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 15th] Hu Shi told reporters today that he will not be able to fly to Nanjing with the other councilors on the 17th because he is suffering from dental disease and needs to have two teeth removed, depending on his condition.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Zhou Binglin will also attend the National Political Council later.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] The method of dividing the proposals for review in the National Political Council has been decided as seven groups, as follows: First Review Committee, reviewing military and national defense proposals. Second Review Committee, reviewing foreign affairs and international issues. Third Review Committee, reviewing domestic affairs. Fourth Review Committee, reviewing finance, economy, and food issues. Fifth Review Committee, reviewing education, culture, and other issues. First Special Review Committee, reviewing transportation, forestry, water conservancy, and other issues. Second Special Review Committee, reviewing social relief, judicial administration, medical and health, and other issues.</p>
<p>Resident Committee Work Report: Added Case on Solving People's Livelihood and Economic Problems</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] The Review Committee of the Resident Committee of the National Political Council was held at 9 a.m. on the 15th, with Fan Yusui, Yin Shuxian, and three others in attendance.

<h3>Main Force of Communist Army Gathers in Yimeng Mountain Area: National Army Is Encirclement and Annihilating Them: Ye Jianying Arrives in Shandong to Replace Chen Yi, Confirmed by Sources</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Bureau, 15th] A part of the main force of the Communist army in Shandong, about four columns, has fled from east of Laiwu and Xintai and gathered near Yishui. In order to annihilate their main force, the National Army has been engaged in fierce battles on the periphery of Yishui from the 13th to the 15th. In the areas of Tushikou in Laiwu and near Mingshui, the National Army has focused on clearing up scattered Communist troops in the surrounding areas in recent days.</p>

As of the 15th, the number of Communist troops killed by tanks alone has reached 4,000. The National Army's rapid forces have now surrounded the two invading Communist armies and are bravely pursuing and annihilating them in the Hongshizhuang and Liujiazhuang areas, 10 kilometers north of Heyang Town, expanding the results of the battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The development of the war situation in Shandong has been highly valued here recently. After the Communist army's East China Field Army lost its second base in Laiwu after Linyi, it dispersed to Boshan to collect the remnants and formed two groups of troops, left and right. The right wing of its troops in Boshan was pursued by the National Army taking advantage of the victory, and it was difficult to escape. The left wing of its troops in Yishan launched an all-out attack, also seeking a decisive battle, giving the National Army an excellent opportunity. Looking at the strength of the Communist army, the so-called East China Field Army is relatively strong. If the National Army can seize this fleeting opportunity and annihilate them thoroughly, it will not only bring the war in Shandong to an end, but also shorten the end of the overall suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] It has been confirmed by all parties that the CCP has sent Ye Jianying to Shandong to preside over military and political affairs. After arriving in Shandong, Ye gave a speech to the Communist army's East China Field Army, roughly saying: "I have been assigned to Shandong to handle the aftermath of General Chen (referring to Chen Yi) and to preside over the battle in Shandong in the future."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] Weixian News: Zhang Deyao and 48 other soldiers of the 3rd Company of the Changnan Independent Battalion of the Communist army, seeing that the Communist army was violating the will of the people and betraying the motherland, took advantage of the Communist army cadres sleeping soundly on the evening of the 7th of this month, revolted together, seized 8 rifles, more than 10 hand grenades, and more than 40 sets of military uniforms, and surrendered to the 8th Army of the National Army.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Government of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Taiwan Provincial Government is officially set for today. Chairman Wei Daoming already flew to Taiwan yesterday. Various organizations, groups, and schools in Taipei have decided to hold a commemorative meeting today to celebrate the establishment of the new provincial government and to welcome Chairman Wei Daoming's arrival. Since the "February 28th Incident," the Taiwanese political situation and its current state have been matters of great concern for the Chinese people. Now that there is a renewal of personnel in Taiwan and a change in public opinion, we naturally have boundless hopes for the new Taiwanese political landscape and the measures of the new Taiwan Provincial Government, and we place these hopes on Chairman Wei and the people of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Although Taiwan is an island isolated overseas, its relationship with the motherland dates back thousands of years. Its people and culture share the same origin as the motherland, and its national economy is integrated with that of the motherland. In the past, Zheng Chenggong's expulsion of the Dutch, Tang Jingsong and Qiu Fengjia's resistance against Japan, and the half-century struggle for restoration by patriots after Taiwan's fall, all represent epic events that could move heaven and earth, causing even ghosts and spirits to weep. This time, with the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Taiwan, wiping away the shame of the Sino-Japanese War and returning Taiwanese compatriots to the embrace of the motherland, people's hearts were excited, and the whole country rejoiced. Who knew that within a year, due to the economy not returning to normal and the reorganization of the military not being reasonable enough, the "February 28th Incident" was brewing, and a spark started a prairie fire, which was a misfortune for Taiwan and a misfortune for the motherland. The aftermath of the incident was quickly spread both at home and abroad. Although the reports were inevitably exaggerated, the factors that caused the incident were numerous. While the system and personnel cannot be entirely blamed, it is clear that the system and personnel were not suitable for the current situation and needed to be changed and adjusted. For the past two months, the central government has handled the situation with caution. In addition to sending Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi to inspect and comfort the people, the government also decided to abolish the administrative governor system based on Bai's report and recommendations, establish the Taiwan Provincial Government according to the current provincial government organization law, and appoint Wei Daoming, a civilian official, as chairman. At the same time, drawing reference from the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, deputy positions were established for the chairman and various offices, broadly recruiting local talent to jointly participate in the government, in order to bridge the gap between the government and the people. This major reform is not only a prelude to refreshing Taiwan's politics but also sets a precedent for civilians to lead provincial affairs. Therefore, since the announcement of the political reform and personnel adjustment, it has given great excitement to people both at home and abroad, and Taiwanese compatriots have welcomed the central government's wise measures with joy. We have always been extremely concerned about the political situation and current state of Taiwan. Today, with the establishment of the new provincial government and a fresh start, we would like to offer some opinions on the political situation of Taiwan and the reform of the current state.</p>
<p>First, Taiwan has the foundation for local autonomy, and local autonomy should be realized as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang expressed on March 10th that local autonomy in Taiwan Province could be completed ahead of schedule. It is hoped that after the establishment of the new provincial government, an important task should be the preparation for local autonomy, the guidance of universal suffrage, and the eventual election of local officials. Based on the experience of the "February 28th Incident," most Taiwanese compatriots, except for a very small number with biased attitudes who were incited by the Japanese or the communists to say "drive out the mainlanders" and "down with the half-mainlanders," still understand the big picture, and there is no shortage of discerning people among the populace. In the past, the estrangement between Taiwanese compatriots and the government, which led to incidents, was due to the lack of political opportunities for Taiwanese compatriots. With the establishment of the new government, many talented people from the province will participate in the provincial government. If local autonomy begins and local talents are guided to serve the local area, it would be very much in line with the spirit of democratic politics and would allow local politics to develop upward.</p>
<p>Second, economic reform is an important plan for Taiwan Province today. Before Chairman Wei left Shanghai for Taiwan, he said, "Regarding the economy, there are no plans to reform the currency system for the time being. However, given the special local economic environment, whether to fully allow free trade after the abolition of the monopoly system or to impose slight restrictions under the principle of economic stability must be decided after on-the-ground investigation." This shows that Wei has a cautious attitude toward local economic reform and will handle it after inspecting and listening to the opinions of the people upon his arrival. According to our research, Taiwan's monopoly system, whether in terms of methods or technology, hinders the development of trade to some extent. It is hoped that the first step in economic reform will be the gradual abolition of the monopoly system and the promotion of conditional free trade, so that goods can flow freely between the mainland and Taiwan, with exports exchanged for imports. This will not only invigorate the national economy but also develop the province's industry and commerce, thereby solving some of the unemployment panic, which will be beneficial to social stability.</p>
<p>Third, solicit public opinion and establish a democratic spirit. Since the "February 28th Incident," the relationship between the government and the people has never been fully integrated. Now that the new government has been established, in order to win the hearts of the people, it should solicit public opinion, seek out the people's hidden suffering, and use it as a guide for policy implementation. It is hoped that the people arrested by the Chief Executive's Office after the incident will be treated leniently; it is hoped that some newspapers that have been suspended will be allowed to resume publication freely, to awaken the Taiwanese people. Furthermore, some radical people and retired soldiers who participated in the "February 28th Incident" are now fleeing and hiding in the deep mountains, and the national army is preparing to search for them. The deep mountains of Taiwan are inhabited by the indigenous people, and if the fugitives hide among the indigenous tribes, it will inevitably lead to endless trouble in the future. It is hoped that the new government and the garrison authorities will take a lenient approach and use methods of appeasement to give them a path to self-renewal. Otherwise, if it drags on for a long time, it will inevitably affect social stability. As for the issue of the future for retired soldiers, the former Chief Executive's Office held discriminatory attitudes. It is hoped that in the future, they will be guided into the right path through education and livelihood. If the provincial government can do this, it is believed that the gap between officials and the people can be eliminated, and any ideological contradictions can be resolved.</p>
<p>Fourth, the importance of education is also greatly related to Taiwan in the future. In the past half-century, Taiwanese compatriots have been immersed in the poison of divisive education by the Japanese, and their understanding of the motherland is not deep enough. Since the recovery, the difference in language between Taiwanese compatriots and mainlanders has caused some misunderstandings. It is hoped that in the future, the provincial government will make special efforts in primary and secondary school education and in the education of the national language, literature, and history. It is especially hoped that talents from all quarters will be recruited to come to Taiwan to promote this, in order to change the general Taiwanese perception of the motherland. This is a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the reform of Taiwan's politics and the construction of new policies involve countless details and are certainly not limited to these. However, for now, we must strive for self-improvement and seek nothing else. We hope, with the attitude of "examining ourselves," that the new Taiwan Provincial Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wei, will use a new spirit and a new style to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, pacify and appease the people, promote autonomy, and establish democracy, so as to comfort the Taiwanese compatriots' longing for the motherland and their sincerity.</p>

On the afternoon of the 15th, led by the village chiefs, they came to the city to petition the county government for relief. Representatives were sent to state the situation, and Secretary Sun, Section Chief Lu of the Social Affairs Department, and Police Chief Tang did their best to encourage them. The villagers firmly demanded concrete measures for relief, and no decision could be made for the moment. Later, the county government agreed to find a way to provide relief immediately, and they dispersed around 5 p.m. However, when there were many people and it was noisy, the security team soldiers fired several shots into the air to maintain order, causing a temporary disturbance, which was quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>At around 8 p.m. on the 13th, 25 prisoners escaped from the local court's detention center in this county.

<h3>Senate Passes US Foreign Relief Bill with Overwhelming Majority, House Amendment Fails</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 14th] The Senate today approved President Truman's original bill of 350 million US dollars for relief to China and Europe by a vote of 79 to 4. The House of Representatives decided to cut this relief fund to 200 million US dollars, which was rejected by the Senate. The Senate bill also stipulates that relief food and medicine must be labeled with the words "Donated by the United States." This bill has now been sent to the Senate and House conference committee for review to adjust the differences between the two houses. The bill does not list the names of the recipient countries, but according to Secretary of State Marshall, most of it will be used to relieve China, Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste, with only 15 million US dollars reserved for emergency relief elsewhere.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The Senate continued to discuss a bill on US relief to China, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste in the amount of 350 million US dollars after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. After a vigorous appeal by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, it was immediately passed by a vote of 79 to 4. Vandenberg said: "The Senate's approval of this bill is necessary to prevent famine in war-stricken countries and to save the moral, political, and social impact after the war." An amendment to reduce the relief funds to 200 million US dollars was also rejected after Vandenberg strongly opposed it. Since the House of Representatives has already passed a bill reducing the relief funds to 200 million US dollars, the Senate and House conference committee will be responsible for reconciling the differences between the bills passed by the two houses. Congressional sources expect the relief funds to eventually amount to 300 million yuan.</p>
<h3>US Government to Submit New Aid Plan to South Korea to Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 14th] Although the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea, the US government is still accelerating its plan to provide economic aid to South Korea, requesting Congress to approve the use of 200 million US dollars. According to authoritative sources, the government will submit this plan to Congress "at the earliest" possible time. According to official sources, the US aid plan in the US-occupied area of Korea is flexible, so that it can be adapted to the same measures taken by the Soviet Union if unification is achieved in South and North Korea.</p>
<h3>British Side Eagerly Hopes for the Realization of Korean Unification</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] As Marshall agreed to reopen the US-Soviet Joint Committee meeting in Seoul, Korea, on the 20th of this month, semi-official sources here expressed the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would succeed in their future efforts to unify the two occupied areas of Korea. They fear that further delays may lead to the irreconcilable nature of communism in North Korea and capitalism in South Korea, because before Korea achieves complete independence, Britain is also one of the four powers responsible for joint trusteeship.</p>
<h3>Hodge Predicts Success for US-Soviet Resumption of Negotiations</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 15th] Lieutenant General Hodge issued the following statement on the convening of the US-Soviet Joint Committee: "I have just received instructions from the US government to prepare for the US-Soviet Joint Committee on May 20. The sound development of Korea depends on the sincere cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. I am as pleased as the Korean people about the reopening of the Joint Committee, and I am willing to do my best to ensure that the Joint Committee achieves success and indirectly contributes to Asia, regardless of any difficulties. Finally, I hope that the Korean people will work together for the future of Asia."</p>
<h3>It is Rumored that the US Congress will Vote on a 1 Billion Yuan Loan to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] A Wall Street Journal correspondent in Japan said: "Congress will vote on a large loan to Japan within five years." The loan may be 1 billion US dollars. The US military government headquarters is currently conducting preliminary research on the funds needed to prevent the collapse of the Japanese economy.</p>
<h3>It is Rumored that the Soviet Union is Establishing a Fifth Column in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 15th] According to reliable sources today, the Soviet Union is now attempting to establish a "Fifth Column" in Japan, organized by "well-trained" Japanese people. These Japanese people are those who have recently been repatriated from areas controlled by the Soviet Union during the war. Some leaders of the "Fifth Column" are Japanese military personnel and civilians captured by the Soviet Union after it declared war on Japan. Other leaders are said to be Japanese who went to the Soviet Union before the war. It is said that if there are 5,000 people in the Fifth Column, it would be enough to distribute them throughout Japan and influence public opinion and actions.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech</h3>
<p>Urges all countries to work together for peace</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Bevin delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, emphasizing the importance of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in November.

<h3>Deformed Plants Produced in Atomic Bombing Area</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 15th] Deformed plants, including strange pumpkins and two-headed eggplants, have been produced in the atomic bombing area of Nagasaki Prefecture, and are currently being studied by Japanese and American experts.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten Recalled to Country, British Cabinet Forms Special Committee to Draft Procedures for Indian Round Table Conference, Nehru Proposes Partition Ideas</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has been recalled to the country to discuss with the government how to return power to the Indian people. Mountbatten is scheduled to return to New Delhi before June 2.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Regarding the fact that Indian Governor Mountbatten will convene leaders of various Indian political parties in Simla to hold a round table conference, the British Cabinet held a meeting to discuss it and immediately decided to form a special committee composed of Prime Minister Attlee, Secretary of Commerce Cripps, Minister of Defense Alexander, and Lord Listowel, Minister of Indian Affairs, to be responsible for drafting a plan regarding the procedures for the round table conference. The purpose of this round table conference is to determine the conditions for Britain's withdrawal from India. According to Indian sources here, the real reason for the postponement of the round table conference is that the British government received a letter from Nehru a few days ago and needs to study it. The domestic side said: "If the plan proposed by the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, to establish an independent Islamic state is accepted, then Hindustan will refuse to help it defend itself when Pakistan is attacked." The Congress Party is willing to give the Muslim League a considerable degree of independence, but still hopes to maintain the unity of India. According to well-informed sources, Lord Ismay, Mountbatten's chief of staff, may bring back a solution based on this letter when he returns to India soon. Lord Ismay decided to leave for India tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Many US Experts to Arrive in Turkey Soon</h3>

<h3>Wallace Writes Extensively About New World Reconstruction Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] Former US Vice President Wallace wrote in his edited "New Republic Magazine," suggesting that a world reconstruction plan be established based on US resources and managed by United Nations agencies. His plan aims to maintain world peace and maintain the stability of the US economy, with international banks raising funds and UN agencies responsible for implementation. Wallace said: "The time has come to try to solve the world's needs from a humanitarian standpoint. It is estimated that the capital needed for the world's postwar reconstruction in the next ten years will reach 150 billion US dollars. The United States accounts for nearly 40% of the world's production capacity and is the only country that can invest abroad, so it should provide other countries with most of their required imports. To restore the pre-war living standards of Europe and Asia, the United States needs to export 5 billion US dollars of materials annually for five consecutive years, and raising the living standards of Eastern Europe to be equal to those of Western Europe also requires a similar amount. Raising the living standards of 1 billion people in Asia to be equal to those of Western Europe requires exporting more than approximately 100 billion US dollars of US materials within ten years." Wallace believes that food negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union are a necessary condition for the success of this plan.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Urges Jews and Arabs to Practice Good Neighborliness at the UN General Assembly, Soviet Union Supports Arab Countries' Demands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th Special Telegram] The United Nations General Assembly today did not achieve any accomplishments other than listening to speeches by representatives from the Soviet Union, China, France, Britain, and others. It then adjourned for the day. No action was taken on the recommendations of the Political Committee on the organization and instructions of the Palestine Investigation Committee. Guo Taiqi of our country requested that Arabs and Jews practice good neighborliness, believing that the solution to the Palestine problem cannot be obtained unless it is based on conscience and goodwill. He also stated that China supports the proposal put forward by Norway this afternoon, which requests that all parties concerned not make threats or use force during the United Nations discussions.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 14th] Soviet representative Gromyko supported the demands of Arab countries, urging the special meeting of the General Assembly to end Britain's trusteeship in Palestine, and advocated clarifying the path to Palestine's independence so that Arabs and Jews can obtain equal rights. He said that Palestine has now completely become a police state, Britain has now lost the hearts of the Palestinian people, and both Arabs and Jews have demanded that Britain's trusteeship be liquidated. There is only one point on which the two sides disagree. If the United Nations investigation proves that the two races cannot live together peacefully, then I agree to divide the holy land into two, with separate Arab and Jewish states.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Investigation Team to be Headed by Hu Shize as Secretary-General</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 14th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced today that the United Nations Secretariat plans to send 40 to 50 staff members, led by an Assistant Secretary-General, to participate in the work of the Palestine Investigation Committee. This Secretariat working group may be led by Hu Shize, Assistant Secretary-General for Trusteeship Affairs.

<h3>Churchill Again Calls for Establishment of United States of Europe, German Problem Must be Solved First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th Special Telegram] Churchill delivered an enthusiastic speech at Albert Hall here tonight, calling for the establishment of a "United Democratic Europe" so that Europe can have a concrete guarantee against aggression. This speech meeting was initiated by the "United States of Europe" Committee, which is composed of parliamentarians representing various parties. Churchill urged the immediate establishment of an organization in Britain to promote the goal of establishing a United States of Europe, and called on British and French politicians to join hands to rebuild Europe, so as to restore its former glory and unite all European countries. He regards today's Europe as a pile of rubble and skeletons, a source of epidemics and hatred, and at the same time emphasized that European countries must not, with the harvest of victory, devote themselves to establishing new barriers of military defense, tariffs, and passport matters, and confront each other. He fully accepted the supreme power of the United Nations to rule the world, but said, "The United Nations Charter also allows for the establishment of regional organizations." He pointed out that the Americas, the Soviet Union, and Britain are such regional organizations, and the United States of Europe must be the fourth regional organization, because these four are the pillars of world peace. He believes that the German problem must be solved first to prevent German thought from turning to rebellion and revenge. He advocates that Britain and France must work together in a friendly manner to bring Germany back into the embrace of Europe, and Britain and France must also make Italy do so. As for the political and natural boundaries of the United States of Europe, Churchill said, "We do not intend to exclude countries whose territories are outside Europe." Churchill finally denied that the establishment of the United States of Europe was a conspiracy against the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Female Spy Writes Poem in Court; Remains Unflinching During Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Han Youjie, formerly known as Nakajima Naruko, a Japanese female spy naturalized in China, was accused of serving as a "trustee" for the enemy and puppet military police and the Army Special Service Agency, responsible for liaising with the puppet local maintenance association, and concurrently serving as the leader of the women's consolation team under Terauchi of the "North China Area Army." Later, she served as a staff officer under Colonel Hagiwara, and was sent to "North Manchuria" to investigate the Soviet army, to incorporate our Yu-Lu guerrilla forces, and had written a book entitled "Twenty Years of Activity in China: A Self-Description." Her crimes were obvious. The High Court pronounced judgment on the case yesterday: "Han Youjie, conspiring with an enemy country to attempt resistance against this country, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for seven years, and her property is confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of her family." Han, still holding a one or two-year-old infant, remained unflinching while listening to the sentence, but requested two points from the court: (1) Because of her appendicitis and dental disease, and the child's foot disease, could she request medical treatment? (2) Could the court allow her to write a poem to present to Madame Chiang Kai-shek? Both were granted. Han immediately wrote the poem in court, writing it in Japanese. The general meaning was that she had lived in China for twenty years and had been a "nanny for Chinese refugees" during the war. She expressed her dissatisfaction with the current sentence, that her two-year-old child was with her in prison, and that her six beloved children were still in the Northeast with no news of them. She requested Madame Chiang Kai-shek's compassion, etc. After writing, she was escorted back to the women's prison by the bailiff. (The attached picture shows Han writing the poem in court, taken by the China News Agency.)</p>

<h3>Lawyer Accused; Files Counterclaim; Demands Compensation for Damage to Reputation of 600 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lawyer Wang Yigong was accused of defamation by Li Yin'nan, owner of the Huashangtai Customs Brokerage. Wang filed a counterclaim. The case was heard in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff, Huashangtai, accused Fang Wencong of encroaching on housing at 16 Shanyuan Lane, Tianjin Road. Fang hired lawyer Wang Yigong to defend him. As a result, Fang Wencong was found not guilty by the District Court. Because Li Yin'nan believed that Wang made defamatory remarks against the plaintiff in court, he sued Wang for defamation. Wang's counterclaim stated that "the elements of defamation must include the intention to damage another person's reputation. If the lawyer is threatened with defamation simply for performing his duties, this trend will destroy the integrity of the legal profession." It also stated: "The plaintiff's actions have actually violated Article 169 of the Criminal Law regarding false accusations. We respectfully request the honorable court to pronounce the defendant not guilty and order the counterclaim defendant to compensate for damages to his reputation in the amount of 600 million yuan, and to publish the judgment in three major daily evening newspapers for three days to compensate for the loss."</p>
<h3>Subsidy for Shanghai's Power Equipment: Large-Scale Power Plant Under Preparation, Executive Yuan Replies to the Senate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Senate recently received a reply from the Executive Yuan regarding its proposal to remedy Shanghai's power equipment situation, stating in brief: "Regarding the request to order the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee to plan a large-scale power plant, the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau Preparatory Office was originally established with the aim of remedying the power needs of the Shanghai area. It has now surveyed and designated Longhua Mouth in Shanghai as the new base for power generation and is carrying out preparatory work. It has also sent personnel to Japan to negotiate the dismantling and relocation of 53,000 kW of power generation equipment. Once the machinery arrives, it will be actively installed. Regarding increasing the power generation equipment of Shanghai's various power plants, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, together with the local competent authorities, has been supervising and assisting in actively repairing the existing equipment of various plants and purchasing new machinery. As for subsidizing the various Chinese-owned power plants, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has successively approved loans. Regarding the request to allocate a portion of the electrical machinery taken from Japanese reparations to Shanghai's Chinese-owned power plants, the initial electrical machinery from Japanese reparations has already been fully allocated. Of these, a 53,000 kW unit is planned to be allocated to the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau for installation. In the future, the bureau can distribute a large portion of its power to Shanghai's various electrical companies and plans to sell a portion of its shares to other privately-owned power plants. As for returning the power generation machinery of the Shanghai Chinese-owned Electric Company that was dismantled and relocated from the Boshan Coal Mine by the enemy, the Resources Committee has agreed to dismantle and return it.

<h3>Senators Jin Zhenyu and Jiang Jianbai Invite Various Sectors to Solicit Opinions for Submission to the Political Council for Government Adoption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Senators Jin Zhenyu and Jiang Jianbai, elected by the citizens of this city, organized an invitation for 4 pm yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant for municipal senators, district chiefs, and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, in order to collect their opinions, so that the suggestions might be conveyed to the government in the upcoming session of the Political Council that will be convened in Beijing on the 20th of this month. Around one hundred people attended the meeting, including Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department Xie Renzhao, senators, district chiefs, and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies.</p>
<p>After the remarks made by Jin and Jiang, Speaker Pan was nominated to share his opinions: "It is important that the two senators, Jin and Jiang, solicit opinions before the meeting. I hope that everyone speaks freely. Personally, I have three requests for the two to bring to the government:</p>
<p>(1) According to general estimates, the tax revenue contributed by Shanghai to the government accounts for more than 40% of the national total. However, the government subsidizes the expenses of various provinces and cities, but Shanghai is unique in receiving no subsidies. Government authorities and the general public believe that Shanghai does not need subsidies, but in fact, the cost of municipal construction in Shanghai is enormous, especially since the damage during the enemy's occupation was very severe and reconstruction is difficult. Relying solely on regular income will definitely be insufficient to cope with the situation. For example, the accumulation of garbage is increasing day by day, which is of utmost importance to the health and appearance of the city. The cost of this cleaning is especially something that the government must help with. The government wants Shanghai to become the largest metropolis and develop industry and commerce, but if it does not allocate funds, it will not only be impossible to build, but it will also make it impossible to maintain the existing facilities. Therefore, I hope that the government can send personnel here to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and at the same time subsidize funds.</p>
<p>Consider Policy Implementation Beforehand</p>
<p>(2) Recently, social order in Shanghai has been chaotic. To stabilize it, attention must be paid to all aspects. In the future, I hope that the central government will pay attention to whether the decisions of many competent ministries and commissions are sufficient to affect or increase the manufacturing of destabilizing factors. Government decisions must be implemented in order of urgency and priority, otherwise the central government's decrees will not be implemented, and local areas will first create disturbances, causing local officials and administrative agencies to suffer losses in money, time, and manpower. Therefore, I hope that the senators will ask the government whether it has made careful consideration before implementing policies. As for things that disturb the people, they should be done less.</p>
<p>The Status of Direct Control Should Be Established Quickly</p>
<p>(3) The status of Shanghai and other directly-controlled municipalities has not been determined. Now that local autonomous organizations are gradually being established, the government has not yet promulgated regulations for direct-controlled municipalities. Therefore, the central government must be asked to establish the status of direct-controlled municipalities, and the opinions of the people's will agencies in the directly-controlled municipalities should be solicited when the Legislative Yuan formulates laws and regulations."</p>
<p>Senator Tao Baichuan then contributed his opinions based on his past experience as a senator, saying: "The Political Council is a line of unity. It has been quite smooth in the past, but now there are some shortcomings. Therefore, it must still be a real line of unity. However, in order to achieve this goal, two major doors must be passed, namely (1) the door of unification, with unification as a condition for unity, which should be brought to the attention of the whole country, and (2) the door of democracy, because democracy is also a necessary door for unity."</p>
<p>Then Xie Renliu, Tong Xingbai, Shao Bingsheng, and others spoke successively, providing opinions on the constitution, local autonomy laws and regulations, and other aspects.</p>

<p>(2) Transfer Procedures</p>
<p>He Da asks: My younger brother was originally enrolled in School A, but because he found that School A had not yet been registered, he transferred to School B. After one semester, School A's registration was approved, so he transferred back to School A. Now, when he asks School B for a transfer certificate, he is told: "The transfer certificate when this student transferred to our school was submitted to the Department of Education, but because the previous school was not registered, it has been returned, so our school has no student status and cannot issue a certificate." Now my younger brother is auditing classes at School A. May I ask your column how to handle this?</p>
<p>[Editor's Reply] According to regulations, the student status of students in unregistered schools should be recognized after the school is registered. It is hoped that you will immediately take the registration certificate of School A and request School B to issue a transfer certificate.</p>

<h3>Yingshi University Students in Hangzhou Travel to Beijing in Batches, Plan to Assemble in Beijing to Petition the Ministry of Education, Minister Zhu Summoned Ten Representatives of Yingshi University Arriving in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The ten representatives of Yingshi University who came to Beijing were summoned by Minister Lai Jiahua on the 15th, and Vice Minister Hang Liwu also returned to Beijing from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Director Zhou Hongjing of the Ministry of Education returned to Beijing from Hangzhou on the 15th. Our reporter specially interviewed him about the Yingshi University issue. According to him: (1) The Ministry of Education is in contact to select and appoint suitable talent for the position of president. (2) The issue of restoring the Medical College of Yingshi University will have to wait until the various facilities are possibly suitable in the future before it can be restored. (3) The students' greatest demand now is to relocate the school. This matter is related to the resolutions of the Educational Rehabilitation Conference and the constitutional principle of balanced regional development of education. The Ministry of Education can hardly violate this and accept the students' demands.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Central News Agency reports: Yingshi University students in Hangzhou are traveling to Beijing in batches, declaring that they will strive for the relocation of the school and three other demands. There are now less than one hundred people left in Hangzhou. Most of them left Hangzhou in classes yesterday and are scheduled to assemble in Beijing within three days to collectively petition the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Yingshi University student petition representatives arrived in Beijing, the reporter immediately asked a certain educator about the issue of Yingshi University's relocation. According to him: "Whether or not Yingshi University should be relocated, the Ministry of Education does not seem to need to make a rigid decision at this time. It can be submitted to the National Education Conference to be held this fall, or it can be proposed for discussion at a future Higher Education Conference. Should Yingshi University be relocated? Should the university network be changed? A careful decision should be made at that time. This is the procedure that should be followed in a democratic government. Since the Yingshi University students have already received higher education, guiding them according to the situation will probably not lead to any objections."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders Various Universities in Beiping to Handle General Examinations Themselves</h3>

<h3>A Wave of Class Boycotts in Various Schools in the City</h3>

The purpose is to improve the level of students so that they can cultivate outstanding talents for the country and society. Article 42 of the newly promulgated school regulations by the Ministry of Education stipulates that in order to improve the level of students, each school may formulate implementation methods. Accordingly, the school is currently hiring three professors to be responsible for drafting new methods to replace the GPA system. Before the new method is formulated, it is not appropriate to change the GPA system. He also claimed that among the thirteen church universities in China today, all schools except St. John's University use the GPA system.

The school authorities held an emergency meeting at 10 am yesterday, and decided to persuade the students to resume classes first, and then argue with the Ministry of Education on the basis of reason. The students did not agree and will continue to strike today</p>

The student scolded back and was tied up and humiliated, but was soon released. After the student returned to school and explained the situation, the majority of the students gathered and went to the factory to question. The mechanic and more than 50 guards saw that the number of people coming was large, so they came out with iron bars and beat more than 10 students. The students thought that the situation had deteriorated, so they gathered more than 300 people and went to Xingyuan for a petition, requesting that the murderer be punished. Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao received them, and after inquiring about the details, he gave three answers: (1) Order the aircraft factory to move out completely tonight; (2) Send someone to investigate whether anyone in the aircraft factory has committed the crime of beating people, and punish them severely according to law, and order the responsible person to apologize and compensate; (3) Immediately remove the guards and have the military police supervise the relocation.

Japonica rice in the North and South markets both fell by 10,000 yuan, and Indica rice also fell by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Baiyuan fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and inferior Yinyuan followed the decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Flour was idle and continued downstream due to the arrival of goods in Changzhou and Wuxi, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran factories continued to supply, sentiment was weak, and prices gradually declined, falling sharply by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading was acceptable. The early market opened with tight conditions, and the close turned slightly weak, resulting in a 1,000 yuan increase. Local oil factories competed to purchase soybeans, and owners turned firm, soaring by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market's digestion was active but not strong, rising first and then falling back, rising by 10,000 yuan. There were rumors that the producing areas were banning the export of raw peanuts, and sentiment was excited, soaring by 120,000 yuan. Sesame remained sluggish, hovering in a tired state. Local and foreign routes for mung beans were very few, and it was feared that it would be difficult to flourish. Red beans remained in the doldrums, continuing to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum fell step by step, shrinking by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and corn remained firm.</p>
<p>Newly harvested Nanjing Xinyuan wheat has initially appeared, with a price of 90,000 yuan per 100 catties in the producing area.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Market Price Drops Sharply, White Sugar Market Price Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market softened and saw a general decline because Taiwan Sugar Company's 15th phase was still allocated in the same way as the previous phase, with 24 crude white and three-and-a-half car white sugar, and an additional allocation of 20 medium granulated white sugar at 320,000 yuan and Taiwan red sugar at 300,000 yuan. Credit was also tight. Peruvian fine sugar broke the 400,000 mark at the initial market, and later 375,000 yuan, falling sharply by 50,000 yuan. 24 crude white sugar fell by more than 40,000 yuan to 410,000 yuan, 20 medium granulated white sugar fell by a small 25,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half car white sugar fell by a small 50,000 yuan to 390,000 to 400,000 yuan, three-and-a-half car white sugar fell by 45,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan, and other local sugars also followed the downstream, Xinghua white sugar fell by a small 30,000 yuan to 365,000 yuan, and Xing red sugar fell by a small 10,000 yuan to 280,000 yuan. Tiqing fell by a small 5,000 yuan to 260,000 yuan, Shunde Qing fell to 245,000 yuan, Taiwan red sugar fell to 320,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>7,000 Tons of Rice Stored, Grain Department of the Executive Yuan to Collect</h3>
<p>According to the Executive Yuan: the Grain Department's main warehouse exchanged 7,000 tons of rice with the Executive Yuan last month. The 7,000 tons of rice were allocated by the Field Grain Department's Hankou branch on behalf of the Executive Yuan, and then allocated by the Executive Yuan to the department's Shanghai main warehouse on behalf of the Grain Department to avoid transportation back and forth. However, the Grain Department warehouse has not yet collected the rice from the Executive Yuan. It is said that the Executive Yuan has sent a letter requesting the Grain Department to collect it.</p>
<h3>Knitwear Manufacturers Request Textile Construction to Allocate Yarn</h3>
<p>Since the textile construction allocated yarn, the 600+ members of the knitwear industry in the Fourth District were allocated by the industry association after applying to the textile construction, based on each member's actual needs. Later, the textile construction changed the method, ordering each manufacturer to apply separately. After filling out the forms in December of last year, the association compiled and forwarded them to the textile construction. It has been half a year, and although some have been approved, more than 200 units have either been investigated without approval or denial, or have not been investigated at all. Recently, the textile construction decided to stop allocating yarn to new factories. The more than 200 knitwear manufacturers who have not received an allocation are afraid of being designated as new factories and not receiving allocation. After days of meetings, they decided to urge the textile construction to make a decision on the previously submitted forms and request an equal allocation.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Initially Active, Then Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market opened with brisk purchases by manufacturers and guest firms, and prices were bid up. 42-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to 12.6 million yuan, and 20-count Shuangma was also seen at 6.65 million yuan. However, because the textile construction company's allocated prices were raised the day before, the allocation quota increased. Yesterday, many futures positions were rolled over, causing liquidity to tighten. And general speculative accounts closed out at high prices, so prices fell back. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix and 20-count Shuangma were on par with the previous day, while other coarser counts had mixed gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Official Prices Increase, Cotton Cloth Mostly Trading Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: Because the textile construction increased the prices of 25 kinds of cloth for sale, Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Jinyin poplin were both at 270,000 yuan, and trading in the market was quite smooth. It was heard that the rules for exporting yarn and cloth were announced, and the restrictions on transportation and sales in the Central China region were relatively relaxed, so guest firms took action to purchase, and people in the industry worked hard to raise prices. As a final result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose to 273,100 yuan, up 5,000 yuan from the previous day. Other brands of fine cloth also rose across the board, from 6,000-7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The prices of bleached cloth, dyed cloth, dyed twill, and blue cloth Shilin cloth all rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flannel Sales Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Among woollen fabrics, flannel is the most complex, and the smoothness of sales depends largely on the weather. In recent years, fine wool flannel has been more popular and active than coarse wool flannel, but because imported goods cannot be shipped, they rely only on Hong Kong to bring them, and scarce goods are expensive, creating a good opportunity for Shanghai-woven factory goods. Because of the lack of circulation of goods in the market, the sales prices of factory goods have mostly soared, almost on par with American goods. Buyers and sellers, in view of the high prices of summer goods such as Paris valitin, regard flannel as relatively cheap, and most of them expect the market to continue to improve, so they often hoard goods. Yesterday, flannel was selling at 250,000 yuan per yard, and the profits of general woollen fabric factories can be described as unprecedented.</p>
<p>Huaxin Woollen Fabric Special Price</p>
<p>Huaxin Woollen Fabric Company has abundant inventory and has scheduled a special sale for two weeks starting on the 16th, with discounts ranging from 30% to 20%, which is good news in the current general price increase.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Joint Venture Production Volume Falls Short of Target</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The production target for the first three months of the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company was originally set at 84,000 bolts of various kinds of silk, but now that two months have passed, the total production volume has reached 40,000 bolts, falling short of the target. According to a person in charge of the company: The purpose of the company's products is for export, so the quality must be top-notch to meet the needs of foreign people. Therefore, the equipment, looms, door widths, and patterns of the textiles are often adjusted and changed from time to time. As a result, the first two months of operation were no different than being in the testing period, and after this, the production situation can be brought into the normal track.</p>
<h3>Tired Wind Spreads in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>For red and green tea exclusively for export, overseas still telegraphed Shanghai tea merchants yesterday, slightly inquiring, but the prices offered were extremely low. It was heard that last year's old tea had shrunk to around 13 pence to 17 pence, and there was still a market, but at this price, the export situation would have to suffer heavy losses, so trading continued to be sluggish and sentiment was depressed. According to the current situation, the tired wind in the foreign tea market may gradually spread. For various domestic sales varieties, the supply and demand are equal, and there are very few differences compared to before. It is learned that crude black tea has regained favor with guest firms in various places, and if the selling price can suit their appetite, they may soon return to the market and engage in absorption.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Executive Committee Passes Many Important Cases</h3>
<p>Proposed Establishment of a South China Import and Export Management Committee</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at Zhongtian Bank yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu, members Liu Gongyun, Wu Rencang, Shen Xirui, Ren Sida, Chen Junren, consultants Ma Ge, and Bu Yien attended, chaired by Vice Chairman Chen, and the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>There were four main proposals: (1) Regarding the import and export interlocking system, each attending member presented their opinions on the advantages and disadvantages, and the case was compiled and reported to the National Economic Commission for reference. (2) The active promotion of exports in South China, the prevention of smuggling in South China, the smooth transportation between the interior and Haikou, and the purchase of export goods in various places were all discussed and are still under consideration. (3) It is proposed to establish a South China Import and Export Management Committee, and its organizational measures are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) A decision has been made on the issue of imported raw materials for processing, and it will be submitted to the Import Management Committee for review.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Decides on This Year's Agricultural Loan Plan, Focusing on Loans for Basic Needs of the People</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the China Farmers Bank, the general outline of the bank's agricultural loan plan for this year is as follows: (1) Externally, focus on providing loans for agricultural products, such as silk and tea loans. The purpose is to increase exports and earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Regarding silk loans, it is known that there are 120 billion yuan in spring cocoon loans, including loans for cocoon collection, cooperative cocoon drying, dry cocoon mortgages, and silk reeling costs. In addition, there are 10 billion yuan dedicated to lending to silkworm breeding and seed production.</p>
<p>Regarding tea loans, the planned amount is between 70-80 billion yuan, including tea farmers' production, processing, negotiation, and mortgage loans.</p>
<p>(2) Internally, focus on providing loans for basic needs of the people (A) In terms of clothing, it is planned to provide 80 billion yuan in cotton production loans. Loans for processing and transportation will be provided when cotton is harvested in the autumn. On the one hand, the equipment of the joint general's cotton ginning factories will be used as much as possible to establish cotton ginning factories in different regions.</p>
<p>(B) In terms of food, there are several hundred billion yuan in loans for increased grain production. The main target of the loan is rice, followed by wheat. In addition, both clothing and food loans will be mainly in kind, such as issuing soybean cake chemical fertilizers. (3) Other general agricultural loans such as agricultural production, rural sideline businesses, agricultural product transportation and sales, morning water conservancy, and agricultural promotion (including high-quality morning tools and livestock breeds) will still be held as before.</p>
<h3>The Four Joint Headquarters End Production Loans, Loans Not Released Before the End of April Will Be Cancelled</h3>
<p>The temporary production professional loans issued by the Four Joint Headquarters last year have reached the end stage. It is learned that all those that have not been contracted and used by the end of April, and those that have been contracted but not used, the Four Joint Headquarters has decided to cancel the original case in order to facilitate the end, and no further loans will be made. However, in order to take into account the facts, manufacturers can apply to the Four Joint Headquarters separately according to the general loan method.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market Price Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The white coal market is still calm, and the market price has changed little. Bituminous coal, Jiangxi Poyang County coal and Fengcheng coal, continue to arrive. As the coal allocated by the factory has been assigned, the demand is very small, which makes people feel weak, and the market price is getting lower and lower. The price of Kaiping No. 2 fines has retreated to 800,000 yuan, but there is still no buyer. Poyang coal has fallen from 950,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan in recent days, and there is no way to sell it in large quantities for a while.</p>
<h3>Musk is Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The price of musk is rising because there are few arrivals. The reason is that the selling price in Shanghai is too low, and there is a lack of hunters in the production area. The selling price in Shanghai is equal to the labor price in the production area. In addition, transportation costs and other costs are added, and the cost is increased, and there is a risk of losing money. At this time of year, it is a necessary item for cooling medicines, so the demand has increased greatly, so the selling price has been increased to attract shipments from the production area.</p>
<h3>Pig Bristles Plummet</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The pig bristle market is in a slump. Shanghai bristles have fallen to 1.7 yuan per pound, Hankou bristles to 3.4 yuan, and Chongqing bristles to 2.17 yuan. The current market price of pig bristles is showing a sharp decline.</p>
<p>Timber Market</p>
<p>The fir market is not active because it is heard that the cost of production is between 1,700 yuan. The foreign pine market is slightly firm.</p>
<h3>Mica is Allowed to be Imported</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is said that the Tariff Management Committee has recently approved the import of mica to be reclassified as the last item in Appendix III (A) as a supplementary material.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Buying and Selling Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>People selling silver dollars on the streets are active again. The police station recently ordered the Huangpu and Laoza divisions to crack down severely. Anyone found to have violated the law will have their silver dollars confiscated and transferred to the local prosecutor's office for legal action.</p>
<h3>Holders Are Unwilling to Sell, Rayon Spirals Upward, Mill Silk Asking Prices High, Silk Goods Sales Slow</h3>
<p>Rayon still saw higher prices in yesterday's market. Gaoshan Youguang No. 120 opened at 6.8 million yuan and spiraled upward, with the noon close at 7.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was even better, and holders were firm in not selling, so the asking price was 200,000 yuan higher than in the morning. As a result, it was 800,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Only four or five boxes were traded throughout the day, absorbed by actual sales accounts. The asking prices for other brands of Youguang also increased across the board. No. 75 half-light was asking 25 million yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The mill silk market saw quite a few transactions yesterday. Each file traded 30-40 bales, with A-grade priced at 19.7 million yuan and C-grade priced at 9.3 million yuan, both 300,000-500,000 yuan higher than the asking prices on the previous day. Dries were relatively sluggish, and the asking prices remained at the original plate of the previous day.</p>
<p>Silk goods sales were sluggish, and trading in the market was also quite calm. Asking prices for quilt covers remained unchanged. Gezifeng silk was first traded at 29,500 yuan, and later at 100-200 yuan. Recently, it was heard that mill silk prices were high, and the asking price was still 29,500 yuan, and the rest of the goods had not changed much.</p>
<p>Allocation of Rayon is Being Requested</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's rayon has been suspended for a long time, which is of great concern to the silk weaving industry. According to a person in charge of the bureau, the bureau is currently requesting the Executive Yuan to instruct on the allocation of rayon, so that it can be followed. He said: There is actually no shortage of rayon in the market. It is estimated that the stocks of each factory will not be completely depleted. Although the asking price in the market is high, the actual transactions are very limited.</p>
<h3>India Bans Silk Weaving Imports, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Ordered a Detailed Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the details of the news that India will temporarily ban the import of foreign silk weaving products from the end of June this year. According to the reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is said that it has ordered our country's ambassador to India to investigate the details nearby. If it is true, the necessary negotiations will be made. It is also heard that the United States will also take the same measures.</p>
<h3>Yingkou Soybeans Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship returned to Shanghai from Yingkou yesterday, carrying more than 4,000 pieces of soybean cake and 7,500 bags of soybeans, which were purchased by the China Grain Company.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>Should the Medical Practitioner Law Be Amended?</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>On April 6th, this publication featured an article by Mr. Butcher, titled "An Unfair Cry Against the Medical Practitioner Law." This article was a "cry of injustice" directed at my piece, "From the Recertification of Medical Practitioners to the Medical Practitioner Law," published on February 28th. After reading this grand discourse, filled with the air of a scholar-official, it leaves behind a ferocious and frightening face. However, I am not fond of arguing, but I never reject well-intentioned criticism, and I must resist unreasonable slander.</p>
<p>Firstly, I must state that I truly admire Mr. Butcher's attention to medical administration issues. However, it is regrettable that he has distorted the meaning of my original article. I hope Mr. Butcher can calm down, read it again, and review the old to learn the new, as there is great hope in that.</p>
<p>For example, I believe that Article 3, Section 3 of the Medical Practitioner Law is a major obstacle to scientific medicine and clearly provides convenience for non-scientific medicine. If this continues, it will lead to the rise of non-scientific medicine as a specialized profession. However, Mr. Butcher has distorted the original meaning. He believes that our complaint is to seek the same qualifications as traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. He considers himself an orthodox figure, labeling others, as he says, "Those who consider themselves Western doctors and have practiced Western medicine for more than five years with outstanding reputations should also be qualified to pass the examination." This is an unreasonable inference. Similarly, it further proves that Mr. Butcher is eager for emotional disputes. We know that the study of traditional Chinese medicine is mysterious and impractical, and the level of practicing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners varies greatly, with all sorts of contradictions. For example, ancient prescriptions and modern prescriptions clash, and fantasy and experience coexist. Should we give this kind of medicine a way to extend its life? Why should we point out a path for it when it barely has time to perish on its own? Isn't this a direct humiliation and discrimination against scientific medicine? As Mr. Butcher said, taking Taiwan as an example, "Taiwan stopped registering traditional Chinese medicine ten years before the Republic and worked hard to cultivate scientific medicine." But why should we work hard to cultivate non-scientific medicine? Taking our Medical Practitioner Law as an example, registering as a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner only requires five years of practice and a good reputation to pass. Isn't this a violation of progressive scientific laws? Looking at Taiwan and thinking about ourselves, can Mr. Butcher say that this is a "somewhat gratifying" thing?</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher believes that the current Medical Practitioner Law is "a major stain on Chinese legislation." Precisely because it is a major stain, we must consider "how our descendants will resent and mock us in thousands or hundreds of years." We, as "ancestors of the 20th century," have discovered the "stain" and should correct it in a timely manner. We must not let this stain remain in history for our descendants to mock and resent. This important factor has been distorted by Mr. Butcher, who insists that we "who consider ourselves Western doctors" want to fight for the same qualifications as traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. This is truly a major stain on Mr. Butcher's morality and a regrettable aspect of his "cry of injustice."</p>
<p>I advise Mr. Butcher not to merely admire the Meiji Restoration in Japan (see paragraph 4 of his article) and willingly debase himself to "shiver with fear." This is useless for facts and truth. We should think about why the Meiji Restoration succeeded and why we still have remnants of feudalism. The reason why our medical community has such enlightened figures like Mr. Butcher is that they respect the legal standing of non-scientific businesses. We cannot simply attribute this to "legislative stains" because there are many "praiseworthy" and progressive people in our group leading scientific medicine who are driving in reverse. What else can be said when the regulations are kowtowed to in the initial draft stage? In addition to blaming the inequality between scientific and non-scientific medicine on "Chinese legislation," Mr. Butcher also specifically emphasized that the reason for the "failure of our country's health undertakings" lies with the "founding elders of the Party-state." Don't you see that in the sixth paragraph of his grand discourse, he clearly wrote: "It is commendable that the health authorities can barely maintain the standards of scientific doctors. It is too much to hope that they can argue on the basis of reason and persuade the founding elders of the Party-state to immediately follow the Meiji Restoration in Japan and embark on the path of scientific nation-building." According to Mr. Butcher's opinion, it seems that the founding elders of the Party-state do not want scientific nation-building and are unwilling to follow the Meiji Restoration in Japan, hoping that China will remain in the unscientific era of the 18th century. I think this is not only insulting the "meritorious founding elders of the Party-state" who "overthrew the Qing Dynasty," but also indirectly trying to provoke the feelings of the people against the elders, making the people disloyal to the country. Mr. Butcher is truly guilty of a great crime! Mr. Butcher further emphasized: "...It is the weak who perfunctorily do what they can and have no power to resist the power of those elders." This self-confessed, counterproductive, and unwise argument inadvertently harmed our hard-working and meritorious Health Administration, which leads and maintains the standards of scientific doctors, because, according to Mr. Butcher, the Health Administration's difficulty is that it cannot persuade the founding elders of the Party-state and cannot resist the power of the founding elders of the Party-state, and there are no other internal or external difficulties. On the contrary, if it can persuade the founding elders of the Party-state, then it will not "only be able to do a little bit perfunctorily." However, we, the common people, want to ask the founding elders of the Party-state, why don't you want your country to be restored and why do you hinder the work of scientific nation-building?</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Butcher advocates completely overturning the Medical Practitioner Law. I really dare not go along with this radical liberal thought because can a country become a country without laws? However, we have reason to request amendments to inappropriate laws to bring them back on track. This procedure is correct. Fortunately, justice is in the hearts of the people, and the hearts of the people are the court. Observers will see the right and wrong. Therefore, I have no interest in arguing when it is unavoidable. Finally, I advise Mr. Butcher not to use the old and immortal posture to call a deer a horse and insult the original meaning of "those who consider themselves Western doctors..." I advise you to put down the butcher knife, otherwise you will still be butchered.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Imparting Medical Common Sense (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Now, let's further discuss what kind of topics are suitable for popular writing that imparts medical knowledge, and what kind of writing is suitable for the public's taste and easy for the public to digest. There are no strict boundaries that can be drawn. However, broadly speaking, it can be divided into two parts: one is the aspect of selecting topics, and the other is the issue of writing techniques.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the aspect of selecting topics: Since the goal of imparting medical common sense is the general public outside the medical field, then the topics chosen must be medical knowledge topics that the general public needs, and daily knowledge is essential. For example, the meaning of medicine itself and the value of medical treatment itself are all things that the general public should understand. How to choose a doctor when sick, how to handle things after the illness (of course, being handled), and how to recuperate after recovery are all common sense that the general public cannot lack. As for the rules of hygiene in daily life and how to avoid the arrival of diseases, that is, the so-called "prevention before it happens," the medical term is "prevention." All kinds of knowledge similar to this are within the scope of common sense that the public needs, and they are also excellent topics for us to write articles that impart medical knowledge!</p>
<p>As for the treatment part of medicine, especially the surgical part of medical treatment, the less the better! That is to say, when it comes to treatment, it can only be limited to the treatment plan or the principle of treatment; because most of the knowledge about treatment belongs to the scope of the doctor himself, and surgical procedures are even more the doctor's business. There is absolutely no need to take them as topics to promote to the public when imparting medical knowledge! If you indiscriminately publicize and impart such treatment methods, or even surgical procedures in diagnosis and treatment, that are not needed by the public, then the general public may have accidents and cause troubles due to temporary carelessness. Isn't this loving someone enough to harm them? Even recently, some medical and pharmaceutical question-and-answer sections in newspapers try their best to introduce medicines, or even attract patients. These are not very appropriate methods. Publicly attracting patients in medical and pharmaceutical answers seems to hinder the personality and morality of doctors. Answering medical and pharmaceutical questions and introducing medicines at every turn, telling patients to buy medicines and take them randomly themselves, is even more of an extraordinarily risky move. If something goes wrong and causes endless disasters, can friends who provide medical and pharmaceutical answers shirk the responsibility? Therefore, I think that medical and pharmaceutical question-and-answer sessions can only answer difficult problems in medical and pharmaceutical science on the principle of imparting medical common sense, and should not arbitrarily teach treatment methods, let alone introduce medicines indiscriminately!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the techniques of writing medical knowledge articles. The importance of selecting topics for writing popular articles that impart medical knowledge has been mentioned above, but the writing techniques outside the topics are equally important. Although the topics of writing for popular propaganda to the public are topics that suit the public's taste and are excellent topics needed by the public, if the writer's writing techniques are not careful and do not pay attention, the words written will be either too specialized or too mechanical, but cannot be popular and universal, and it is still difficult to achieve the purpose of imparting medical knowledge and achieving the effect of promoting medical knowledge. Because although the topic is popularized, if the writing has not been popularized, it still cannot be understood by the public. If it cannot be understood, how can it be expected to benefit and expect to obtain the benefits of writing articles that impart medical knowledge? It's like cooking side dishes. Although the essence of side dishes is materials that nourish the body, if they are not cooked properly and cooked too bland or too salty, they will lose their taste; if they are not cooked enough and are not cooked thoroughly, they will not be easily digested when eaten in the stomach. Writing medical knowledge articles is also the same. Although the topic is appropriate and popular, if the writing is not explained clearly and lacks care, it is still not easy for the general reader to understand. If it cannot be understood, how can it be expected to benefit and expect to obtain the benefits of writing articles that impart medical knowledge? Therefore, when we write this kind of medical knowledge article, we should try our best to cater to the public and not consider being simple and popular as inelegant; when encountering specialized terms, we may as well spend more words to explain them in detail, so that they can be popularized and simplified before stopping. It is not too much or too lengthy to spend dozens of words to explain and describe a non-popular specialized term; because we are imparting knowledge to the public and promoting medical knowledge to the public, not writing eight-legged essays or parallel prose.</p>
<p>It is said that to write medical knowledge articles for popular propaganda, not only should the topics be in line with the needs of the public, but also the descriptions and explanations of the writing should be popular and common for the public to understand. But in reality, it is not much easier than writing specialized academic articles. To be more precise: to truly write popular articles with topics that are palatable to the public and writing that is clear, simple, lively, and energetic, it may be more laborious and troublesome than writing general specialized medical articles.</p>
<p>However, to truly write popular articles for the purpose of imparting medical knowledge, it still depends on each person's writing skills and each person's natural talent, and the writing style varies according to the different skills and talents of each person. Or to put it more clearly: each person has his own way of writing medical knowledge articles; what is called the way of imparting medical common sense here is just a general or broad statement of the principles.</p>
<h3>Research on the Mixture of Calcium Gluconate and Vitamin C and its Effect on the Living Body</h3>
<p>— Wu Guocheng</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Shen Songnian's article "Calcium Gluconate" in the tenth issue of this publication, and saw the editor's remarks, as to whether calcium gluconate and vitamin C will undergo chemical changes when mixed in a syringe, and cannot be determined. Now I will make a popular and brief description of the results of my actual experiments and their chemical relationship:</p>
<p>Anyone with basic organic chemistry knowledge knows that gluconic acid and vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) are both extremely weak organic acids, and calcium is a weakly alkaline substance. When these three substances are put into a liquid together, if there is enough or too much calcium, it should be the calcium salts of both. If the amount of calcium is insufficient, the type of calcium salt to be formed should be determined by the binding force of the two acids and calcium. However, whether the salt formed is effective in the living body depends on the condition of the salt formed; if the salt formed is water-soluble and ionized, it will be effective in the living body. On the contrary, if the calcium salt formed is insoluble, or although soluble, it is a kind of chemically so-called intramolecular compound, it is still ineffective or its effect is minimal and cannot be used. Because intramolecular compounds do not generate calcium ions in water, do not participate in ordinary chemical changes, and lose the properties of calcium, the prerequisite is to determine whether it is an intramolecular compound. Now I have tested the two calcium salts separately and mixed them with oxalic acid, and both produced calcium oxalate precipitate, which is enough to prove that they are not intramolecular compounds. Therefore, no matter what kind of calcium salt it is, it is effective in the living body.</p>
<p>As for the statement that vitamin C can dissolve calcium in the living body, it seems to lack scientific basis, because Mr. Song Guobin believes that acid trade has the ability to dissolve calcium, that is, vitamin C must make the blood acidic in the body to have this effect, but the blood of the human body is weakly alkaline, chemically PH. 7.35. (PH. 7 is neutral, above 7 is alkaline, below 7 is acidic). On the other hand, vitamin C for injection is adjusted to a solution of about PH. 6.8 (the ordinary liquid is 5% vitamin C). This kind of vitamin C liquid with extremely weak acidity, even if used to 10,000 international units, only contains 0.5 grams of vitamin C. It is fundamentally impossible to shake the blood into acidity with this trace amount and extremely weak acidity. What's more, the living body still has the function of controlling and regulating. If the blood becomes acidic, it will immediately become acidemia (acidic blood disease). Therefore, vitamin C can never dissolve calcium in the living body.</p>
<p>Whether gluconate calcium or calcium and gluconic acid can destroy vitamin C should be a matter of concern. If it can, then mixing these two substances is still unreasonable. I used these three (gluconic acid, calcium gluconate, and calcium hydroxide) and mixed them separately into vitamin C, and placed them for two hours. I used 2.6 Dichlorphenol-indolphenol to test vitamin C and proved that it was not destroyed at all.</p>
<p>Regarding the statement that "the calcium in the body of patients with fibrous tuberculosis has reached saturation," it does not seem to be as Mr. Shen Songnian said that it must become gypsum to be considered saturated, because the human body needs a certain amount of calcium. Reaching this required amount is called saturation. If there is too much calcium, it must be excreted by the urinary organs, but there are exceptions in special circumstances, such as the need for oversaturated calcium in patients with tuberculosis and oversaturation in patients with bone calcification. As for elderly people with arteriosclerosis or bone calcification, the calcium in their bodies seems to have reached saturation, and there is no need to use calcium preparations again. If there is no such disease, then the need for calcium should be a reasonable requirement. However, even patients with tuberculosis who have arteriosclerosis or bone calcification should use it appropriately when their lesions need to be supplemented with calcium, just as Mr. Shen said, "do not stop eating for fear of choking."</p>
<p>I dare to question Mr. Song and Mr. Shen in the spirit of mutual discussion of academics, what do you think?</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Rabies (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Jindou</p>
<p>After a latent period of varying or short duration, the disease begins, with symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, insomnia, irritability, and tremors in the limbs. If the bite is on the head or face, there are often continuous sneezes. This stage lasts approximately three to four days and is called the melancholic stage (MelancholischeStadium). During this time, the lymph nodes around the bite wound swell, causing burning pain.</p>
<p>Next, convulsions and mental confusion occur, saliva secretion increases, and the respiratory tract and swallowing muscles of the pharynx often spasm, leading to irregular breathing and difficulty swallowing. The patient is extremely thirsty but cannot drink a drop of water. The patient pants and thirsts, experiencing great pain. The hydrophobia phenomenon mentioned earlier, where seeing water or thinking about drinking causes spasms, appears at this time. Therefore, this stage is called the hydrophobia stage (Hyorophobie Stadium).</p>
<p>Later, mental excitement gradually develops, even progressing to madness. The reflex function of the sensory organs becomes hyperactive. Despite extreme thirst, saliva secretion becomes even more profuse, the pulse becomes weak and irregular, and the body temperature rises even higher, possibly exceeding forty-three degrees Celsius. This stage is called the maniacal stage (Maniakalsche Stadium). In reality, the hydrophobia and maniacal stages are not easily distinguished. These two stages merge and occur together for two to three days to four to five days.</p>
<p>When the maniacal stage occurs, death is not far off. However, before death, there is a paralytic stage (Paralytische Stadium). At this time, convulsions and tremors may cease, and the patient may be able to eat and drink, seemingly showing signs of improvement. In fact, this indicates that they will soon be sleeping in the afterlife. By then, they are suffering from both hunger and thirst, exhausted all over, and their heart is failing, so their life cannot be prolonged.</p>
<p>The above staging is artificial. The symptoms of the disease do not necessarily follow such clear-cut stages. At least, there may be some overlap, but the difference should not be too great. However, in the case of so-called "quiet rabies" (Stille Wut), the onset is with paralysis, making the disease even more aggressive, leading to death in two to three days.</p>
<p>Once someone unfortunately contracts rabies, trying to save their life with internal medication is like thinking that a hernia (commonly known as a bowel prolapse) can be cured by internal medication alone. Both are incorrect and hopeless ideas. Once rabies develops, the patient is bound to die. Applying strong disinfectant drugs to the wound area as early as possible, or using cauterization or excision methods, cannot be reliably believed to completely eliminate the virus. It only possibly prolongs the latent period. Even amputating the affected limb is not a completely reliable treatment. Therefore, in addition to taking such emergency measures on the wound area, the most important step is to observe whether the attacking animal is indeed rabid. If it is proven to be a rabid animal, or if the attacking animal cannot be found, then the person who was bitten must quickly undergo Pasteur's rabies vaccination therapy to save their life. How to administer the vaccine is not described in detail due to space limitations.</p>
<p>If a dog attacks and bites, do not, in a moment of anger, kill it to vent your rage. This is not to say you should show a great national spirit of repaying evil with good. Unless it can be proven that the attacking dog is indeed rabid, it should be captured and closely monitored to see if it shows signs of rabies. If it continues to live normally within two weeks, then the person who was bitten can rest assured that they will not be infected with rabies and does not need to be vaccinated. It has been discovered that a very small number of people develop extremely serious and fatal paralysis after receiving the rabies vaccine. This paralysis is not a reaction to the vaccine, but rather a personal allergy to rabbit brain spinal cord (the raw material for the rabies vaccine is rabbit brain spinal cord). However, this precaution is not enough to dissuade people who have been bitten by a rabid animal and infected with rabies from being vaccinated for prevention. I reiterate that people who have been bitten by a rabid animal should, to protect their lives, quickly get vaccinated without hesitation, and the sooner, the better!</p>
<p>Recognizing rabies is also very important. The following describes the general condition of a rabid dog. The first sign of rabies is a change in temperament. A dog that was once tame and gentle becomes irritable, sinister, fearful, timid, tries to hide, avoids food, moves slowly, and barks hoarsely. But it may also become unusually affectionate, extremely adorable, unwilling to leave its owner, and fond of licking hands and feet. After a day or two, it becomes more restless, wandering back and forth, agitated and unable to stay calm, but still able to obey commands and not yet biting or attacking. As it progresses, it becomes less tame, bares its teeth and growls, threateningly barking, as if self-defensively intimidating, but upon closer inspection, there is no target to intimidate, but rather a vain and aimless irritability. Sometimes its eyes are red, and it runs around wildly, chasing poultry and livestock. If it is kept indoors, it becomes agitated, making scratching and tearing gestures, or turning over its nest and gnawing on furniture, and it likes to gnaw on soil, wood chips, and other things, and it is also prone to biting people. If it is a free-ranging dog, it will wander far from home, adventuring aimlessly. It does not intentionally go out to cause trouble, but in fact, it is still cowardly and avoids people from afar, daring not approach, with tight jaws, unable to close its mouth, drooling and sticking out its tongue, and its tail tucked between its legs. But when faced with opposition or obstacles, it will bite ruthlessly. Rabid dogs also show signs of hydrophobia, cannot eat or drink, and gradually become emaciated and haggard. As it approaches death, it will still wander erratically, groping its way back home, eventually becoming paralyzed, lying quietly, and dying. During the course of rabies, the dog sometimes seems to have a bone stuck in its throat, showing an unusually uncomfortable expression, which will indeed make you unable to bear to watch, and you will want to help it get rid of its trouble sympathetically. However, you must not be so kind, not only will you not help the dog, but you will also harm your own life!</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure. This principle applies to all diseases. Not only should medical professionals bear the responsibility of promoting this, but everyone should understand this principle. Special care should be taken to prevent rabies.</p>
<p>Rabies can occur in any season, and there is always a risk of misfortune. It is more common in humans in spring and summer, because the weather is warm, and people of all ages are unwilling to stay indoors and like to take walks outdoors or stroll through the streets. Especially during the Qingming Festival and spring vacation, many people go to the countryside to enjoy the scenery and play in the fragrant grass, which increases the chance of contact with wild rabid dogs. Therefore, I hope you will all be cautious in preventing it and not suffer from it and return disappointed.</p>
<p>As for public prevention methods, the focus should be on dogs. If rabid dogs, the root cause of the disease, are eliminated, then human cases can certainly be reduced or even eradicated. I propose several points for discussion.</p>
<p>First, capture stray dogs: All dogs without owners are poorly fed, have unclean fur, wander the streets, raise their hair and defecate, which is both unsightly and unhygienic. Even if there is no risk of rabies, they should be captured and banned. The police station should have dog-catching vehicles on the road to carry out this task, which is indeed a wise measure.</p>
<p>Second, impose heavy taxes on dog ownership: Dogs can guard the door at night, so it is appropriate to raise and utilize them, but there is a risk of rabies, so it is not appropriate to encourage raising them.</p>
<p>Third, use muzzles: Dog owners often neglect this. After wearing a muzzle, even if you do not guard against it going mad, it cannot inflict the disaster of biting, which is easy to do. I deeply hope that dog owners will advocate for this.</p>
<p>Fourth, preventive vaccination can not only prevent the dog itself from getting sick, but also completely eliminate the cause of human illness. I hope that the health authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>These Days</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>These days, under the dual pressure of material and spiritual burdens, I have fallen ill!</p>
<p>While ill, I take no medicine, do not dine, do not go out, and see no guests. I persevere, working as if I were well, cruelly deceiving myself.</p>
<p>Poverty I can endure; poor health I can remedy; but the collapse of my emotions is what I suffer from!</p>
<p>My poor mood is certainly due to poverty and illness, but it is also influenced by many objective stimuli. For example: you don't want to do something, but others force you to do it; you clearly haven't committed any wrongdoing, but others insist on blaming you for committing a wrongdoing; the path you're walking is straight, but others scold you for walking it crookedly; you want to be content, but others won't let you be content; you were originally content, but others insist that you're not; you want to live for yourself, but others want you to live for them; you've worked as a dressmaker for others everywhere, but others still think it's not enough... All of this is enough to drive you crazy, to leave you feeling lost and bewildered!</p>
<p>During this time, I have doubted the entire universe. I have cursed that its laws of creation and destruction do not follow a standard of good and evil, therefore, truth cannot be found, and righteousness cannot be established! I have also hated the entire human race. I feel that people are too selfish, too scheming, and too lacking in lofty sentiments and integrity! So I have been angry, and I have wanted to reverse this tragic situation, but my strength is too weak, and I can only grieve!</p>
<p>Finally, after racking my brains, I have managed to find a way of life in this chaotic world that allows me to feel at ease. I am trying to gradually transcend myself. I use absolute stillness and silence to calm my heart and soul. I am working hard to cultivate a religious spirit. It is in this way that I am beginning to pass my days...</p>
<p>As usual, I can't get up until ten o'clock at the earliest, which helps to shorten the hours of daylight that I loathe.</p>
<p>Once I've finished washing, I go into my study, which is about the size of four sleeping mats. The first thing I do is light a stick of incense on my desk. I don't worship the Buddha or chant scriptures, I just sit quietly at my desk, trying to see myself through the curling blue smoke. When I discover that I still have blood, flesh, thoughts, emotions, a heart, and a soul, I smile! Because I am glad that everything about me is still alive, after yesterday's false death--falling asleep is a false death--and that nothing about me has been lost. Perhaps this is what is meant by "from nothing something comes, and to nothing it returns"!</p>
<p>I stare blankly as the blue smoke turns into clouds, turns into mist, and then I open the window, letting a gust of clear wind blow away the clouds, blow away the mist, and turn it back into air. I breathe it in, and then breathe it out, and then emptiness and loneliness descend upon me, and I collect myself!</p>
<p>I solemnly pick up my pen, and I faithfully cover sheet after sheet of blank paper with my blood; my flesh; my thoughts; my emotions; my heart; my soul! I express everything about myself in such a pure and genuine way, not for any other reason, not to gain people's understanding; not for any reward after a sale; but only to prove to myself that I still know cold and warmth, that I can still distinguish right from wrong, that I still know shame and evil, and that I can still love and hate!</p>
<p>And so two-thirds of the day flies by under my pen. Twilight obscures my light, and blurs my eyes, so I put down my pen and move several pots of fresh flowers to the third-floor veranda to prepare them for absorbing the dew at night. Then I walk to the courtyard to admire the goldfish in the tank. I envy those little red and black animals that swim leisurely and tirelessly in the green oil. They are so free, peaceful, carefree, and happy! They never care about the world outside the tank. They regard the world outside the tank as hell, so they would rather die of old age in their small universe than take a single step outside the tank. They disdain associating with humans--whom they regard as demons--outside the tank. Therefore, I am ashamed to approach them too closely. I respect their kite!</p>
<p>It's time for me to go for a walk. I walk to the end of Shanyin Road, strolling under a row of nameless trees, silently stepping on the fallen leaves, counting my own footprints. Occasionally, I also look up at the vast sky. My heart sometimes races with the clouds, and my soul winks at the stars! If there is a moon, I will find a clean spot to sit down, or lie down, and let the moonlight embrace me, and I will kiss the moonlight with all my passion, all my love.</p>
<p>The night sends me back to the small building, back to the study, back to that chair that is like the mouth of a tiger.</p>
<p>I pick up my pen again, continuing to write the "unfinished" words. The cigarette butts have already piled up into a jagged little mountain. There are no more voices of people or things around, so I brew a covered bowl of the hottest clear tea, and perhaps even pour a glass of wine--Yellow Dragon, or Green Bean Burn--drinking it slowly, to wash away and clarify the fatigue and dust of the day. At the same time, I use ivory tiles to "pass the checkpoints"; "slay the generals"; "seize the treasures"; "divine the hexagrams"; to help me dispel the day's troubles; vent the day's emotions; although I will never be able to "pass" all the "checkpoints"; slay a demon "general"; obtain half a golden "treasure"; or divine anything but the lowest "hexagram."</p>
<p>When the tea and wine are gone, I open a collection of Tang and Song poems and prose to read, wanting to learn how the ancients wrote about their blood, flesh, thoughts, emotions, heart, and soul. As a result, from Du Fu's poems, Li Qingzhao's lyrics, Du Guangting's "The Story of the Curly-Bearded Guest" and Le Shi's "The Song of Lasting Regret," I only see genuine, pure, and honest "truth"; beautiful and noble "beauty"; and virtuous and profound virtue! However, I cannot "learn" it, even though I have the ambition.</p>
<p>After a long time, I need to rest. Like usual, after washing, I go into the bedroom, lie down, close my eyes, stop the waves of thought, and just quietly listen to the night, and whisper silently to the night, until the god of dreams pulls me into another illusory realm!</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Lao Kai</p>
<p>Blackness. The chirping of insects on the lawn seems to be singing a funeral song for spring, or perhaps they are annoyed by spring's departure.</p>
<p>The streetlights, with their drowsy eyes, stare at those few French parasol trees, green to the point of blackness, apparently deeply lamenting the trees' already vanished age of virginity.</p>
<p>Everywhere exudes the mood of early summer, especially on this rainy night.</p>
<p>I sit alone at my desk, sometimes looking out the window, sometimes sinking my thoughts into the sound of raindrops soaking and dripping. The rooster crows for the first time, and still there is not a trace of sleepiness.</p>
<p>From the blue haze of the cigarette, I suddenly think of the violin. Not long ago, could I not hear the sad lament of the violin coming from next door?</p>
<p>However, this music lover, yesterday, already supported by his instrument, walked towards the distance. For the loss of him and that mournful sound, I feel as disoriented and disappointed as if I lost a lover.</p>
<p>Next to my hand, lying lonely, is Dostoevsky's novel. I open it, letting the ghastly lamplight shine on the miserable faces and tragic encounters of those insulted and injured. In between this, tears actually secretly seep out of the corners of my eyes. I am thinking that our reality is not at all different from theirs.</p>
<p>I stand up, pacing with heavy steps, the floor under my feet emitting a thudding sound. The pain of creation corrodes me. The damp night air assails me. But I, on the contrary, do not feel alone, and neither do I, as a result of the dreariness, step into the mournful fog.</p>
<p>I have quite beautiful fantasies--draping myself in a poet's cloak, I move towards that boundless newly arisen prairie; or, with a mud-smeared walking stick, I advance in the stark desert without a trace of human smoke. At that time, even if the wind and sand hit my whole body so I bled, or sharp rocks broke my toes, I would also stubbornly smile, I would also slash open the cosmos' entanglement?, breathing in the ancient English air.</p>
<p>The roosters' crows gradually increase in number. In the distance, the rumbling sounds of single-wheeled carts and laborers' songs shatter the deathly silence all around.</p>
<p>I know: this is the moment when the waning night will end. Hastily, I turn my prolonged, deep gaze towards outside--</p>
<p>The corner of the sky in the east splits open a streak of silver. Dawn is slowly dragging its red cart as it rolls from atop that streak of silver.</p>
<p>I know: the waning night is quickly dying, hastily I press down on my heart's jumping and listen intently, and I carefully distinguish:</p>
<p>What is dawn's footstep, what is the weary sigh of the rain on the leaves.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Yachen's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Location: Guohua Yuan, Nanjing West Road, at the intersection with Chengdu Road:</p>
<p>Time: May 15th to 21st.</p>
<p>I would like to give Brother Yachen a nickname: "Wang Goldfish"! In fact, this nickname was established more than ten years ago, and today it is just a matter of revisiting an old topic. Why? When it comes to painting, everyone has their own specialty: Beihong's horses, Daqian's lotuses, Shiqi's peacocks, Shanshou's tigers, Baoshi and Junbi's landscapes, Shaoang's cicadas, Chuntai's chrysanthemums... and Yachen's fish. Painting is like writing, each has its own personality. A painter is like a writer, he must have his own unique style; so that a viewer, or a reader, can guess who the author is just by looking at the work, without looking at the signature. Having personality does not necessarily mean that the work has value; however, there is absolutely no reason for a work without personality to have value. Yachen's paintings, the fish Yachen paints, especially the goldfish Yachen paints, mixed in with the works of others, even though I suffer from nearsightedness, I can distinguish them, probably eight or nine times out of ten.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhao Songxue painted horses, crawling on the ground imitating the horse's posture. I don't know if Yachen had a special extra-large goldfish tank custom-made? Maybe he asked Mrs. Junli to act as a goldfish, and he painted her from the side. In short, our son-in-law from Wuxi, when he goes to Wuxi every summer vacation to be a "prince consort", must admire hundreds of tanks of goldfish, captivated and enlightened in his mind, and then apply it to his brush and ink.</p>
<p>"You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish?" I am not Wang Yachen, but I know the joy of Wang Yachen painting fish! First, seeing things evokes emotions, he paints fish on paper, and paints Junli in his heart; second, his personality is gentle and elegant, quite like a fish--good heavens, I'm referring to goldfish, not crocodiles! I instruct people to stand facing Yachen, observing him painting goldfish: when he is immersed in his work, his eyebrows, eyelashes, and nose all move; --just like Alexandre Dumas writing a novel, laughing heartily when he gets to the good parts (since he has to "hold his belly", of course, he temporarily puts down his pen), and crying loudly when he gets to the sad parts.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Yachen closed his doors to guests, working hard on his paintings and admiring goldfish. Of course. The scope of his paintings is not limited to goldfish, he paints all kinds of flowers, birds, and feathers. He has also worked hard in calligraphy. This exhibition, if I remember correctly, is the first one since the victory, and also the first one after many years of seclusion: nurturing his spirit and accumulating his strength, it is bound to be quite remarkable.</p>
<p>If the reader, miss or mister, after reading my "fishy article," is not moved and does not go to see the fish painted by Yachen, especially the goldfish, and other things: then, I will regret that she or he has missed a rare opportunity for artistic enjoyment!</p>
<h3>A Group of Chicks</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<h3>Thomas More</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>The founder of the English Renaissance, the author of the novel "Utopia", Thomas Moore (1475-1535), was a man of great talent and high moral character. He offended King Henry VIII and was sentenced to death. When he went to the chopping block, he remained calm and composed, and smiled at the executioner, saying: "This beard has committed no crime, isn't it a pity to cut it off with me?" After saying that, he lifted his beautiful beard with his hand, and stretched his neck to be beheaded.</p>
<h3>Door</h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>In my consciousness, there often appears a door. Its metal body emits light, giving people a heavy feeling like a metal object. All around that door, clouds of mist are rising, sometimes seeming very close, sometimes seeming very far away.</p>
<p>In my moments of joy or loneliness, that door often seems to be swiftly pushed in front of me by a cart, and then immediately disappears.</p>
<p>What kind of omen and secret is this? Is the inside of the door a narrow prison cell or a vast space unfolding? Will a devil's hand reach out from that side, or will endless treasures flow out?</p>
<p>I cannot guess at all. I curiously gaze at it with the eyes of my consciousness. I long to know its contents, but I have never tried to touch or open it.</p>
<p>In my afternoon nap today, I unconsciously walked into a palace. On that side, all kinds of strange faces emitted the sounds of various different musical instruments, and from those transparent living pillars, flames sometimes spurted out, and sometimes clear springs rippled. I felt that this overly vast and deep place was filled with a terrifying atmosphere; when I shouted loudly, I don't know how I was already standing outside the door.</p>
<p>That door is the old friend I meet morning and evening. It is still so brilliant and solemn, steaming with heat, as if saying:</p>
<p>"Ah, child, you are only worthy of gazing at me from afar."</p>
<p>I could not bear that mockery. With all the anger of my life, I fiercely pushed it open. In a crash of earth-shattering sounds, I woke up.</p>
<p>At this moment, I have returned to the human world, sitting in living reality. I have tried several times to reconstruct the image of that door in my consciousness, but it is impossible. What appears is only a white expanse of fog, mixed with a ring of intense light, seeming to be a most primitive landscape belonging to the era of nebulas.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Oh...! This is the third 'Oh'. Speaking frankly, at this moment, Hejian really doesn't know what to say that would be appropriate. He can't even think of something inappropriate to say; it's because this young lady only cares about speaking her own mind, and after speaking, she slams the door shut, leaving no room for others to interrupt.</p>
<p>"But I think... my time is limited," this tone was tinged with impatience; it was like writing an article, using the words "but" to open the next paragraph. "And I don't know when my brother will come again, perhaps he won't come at all; so..." At this point, she revealed a row of white, even teeth, adding two shallow, dimpled smiles, giggling, "so I think I should just talk to you directly...!" Without even looking at Hejian's reaction, not welcoming him, since Hejian had entered, a light shone, flooding the room.</p>
<p>"Isn't this...?" Hejian watched her walk into the room, thinking, "If she wanted to talk directly, she should have said so earlier, wouldn't that have been the end of it? Why bother with so much fuss?"</p>
<p>"Very well, please sit down, Miss." Hejian did not casually close the door. In Hejian's mind, of course, there was no concept of "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," and there was no need to keep the conversation a secret. As for why he left the door open, perhaps he hoped that this Miss Mo would finish speaking in a few words and quickly leave, saving him the trouble of opening and closing the door?</p>
<p>"I think it would be better to close the door, is that okay?" Although she asked, she didn't care about authority or anything else, walked over and slammed the door shut with a "bang"; turning around, she boldly picked a small sofa by the window and sat down comfortably. As soon as she sat down, she looked up:</p>
<p>"I want to ask you a question, Mr. Gu..."</p>
<p>"Oh...!" Hejian hadn't even had time to sit down, "Please, enlighten me..." Hejian really had no choice but to hope she would "enlighten" him quickly and leave quickly.</p>
<p>"Enlighten? ...How polite...! I'll ask you a small thing first! I presume you have a handgun here? Any kind, as long as it's a handgun." The question was asked so abruptly, but her expression was so light and nonchalant.</p>
<p>Hearing this question, Hejian was naturally startled; he really didn't understand what her motive or intention was in asking this question; as for any reason, he couldn't explain it at all.</p>
<p>"A handgun?... "</p>
<p>"That's right... Let me be clearer; I want to use a handgun to test something."</p>
<p>When a person is extremely embarrassed, they may sometimes be provoked into a stubborn streak, and the triggering of this stubborn streak sometimes requires the other party to provoke it, and sometimes it can erupt automatically. Moreover, Hejian was neither weak nor incompetent. The reason he was embarrassed at this time was simply because he was in a bad mood at the time, and he was caught off guard by this young lady, and her appearance was so peculiar. At the same time, Hejian's problem was that he always maintained his consistent "gentlemanly" demeanor, preferring to suffer some grievances himself rather than be rude to others, especially a woman, and even more so a young woman like Yaoqun at the beginning. But the suppressed stubborn streak was limited.</p>
<h3>"Internship" of Jiaotong University Students</h3>
<p>— Leike</p>
<p>The students of Jiaotong University recently petitioned, among whom the fourth-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department once privately assembled a locomotive in the garage and added twenty-seven sleeping cars, preparing to take all the students to Beijing. According to the newspaper report the next day, these senior students, after several test runs, finally started the train again in the middle of the sound of the whistle after half an hour. "The train started from slow to fast, very naturally and smoothly. The driving skills exceeded expectations." The writer does not want to enumerate the rights and wrongs of this petition, but in this chaotic phenomenon, seeing that university students can drive trains by themselves, and the skills are quite good, finally feels that these mechanical students have not failed the education given to them by the school, and the practical education of Jiaotong University in this aspect can also be regarded as impressive.</p>
<p>In the evening paper, this matter was described in more detail. It is said that the students of Wang Sili were sitting in the locomotive because "they had no driving experience, so they felt quite difficult when they started driving." Some doubts had to be solved by asking the workers in the station, and although they got their faces and hands covered with coal dust, "it was still not smooth." From this, it can be seen that these students usually have no opportunity for practical driving, and if there had not been this petition, perhaps they would never have any opportunity. We do not know whether these students specialize in this subject, but if they do, then their lack of practice is a pity.</p>
<p>However, after the workers at the station refused to explain, and after overcoming the extreme difficulties, the train was finally started by them. The value of this internship has far surpassed the lectures in their textbooks and classrooms. (If they are specializing in this subject.) The usefulness of internships is also fully demonstrated here.</p>
<p>In any case, the activities of Jiaotong University students at the North Station this time, except for a little internal dispute at the end, the allocation of work and the command of actions all showed an efficiency rarely seen in past student activities. From this, it can be seen that the scientific education they received on weekdays was not in vain. In the eyes of the general public, this can be regarded as a gratifying phenomenon in misfortune.</p>
<p>However, what all this shows is only a kind of technique. Technique is important, but more important is the direction of manipulating technique. We are very happy to see the achievements that the students have obtained from education, but we also sincerely hope that they can make good use of this valuable achievement.</p>

<h3>Memories of Taiyuan</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>The merchants from the north, their felt hats covered with a layer of yellow sand, the country bumpkins who slipped down from the Taihang Mountains in the east, and the rough men who came from the fertile fields of southern Shanxi, covered in wheat and cotton fragrance, when they first walked out of the noisy Taiyuan Railway Station and looked up at the solemn and majestic city towers, they couldn't help but exclaim in unison: "This is a big city."</p>
<p>But near the city gate, there was a swarm of open-air noodle stalls, and heads and steaming mist surged on the rows of benches; even more were the Jin-Han department store stalls that had pulled up cloth awnings; and traveling merchants and hawkers who shuttled back and forth with shoulder poles, as well as craftsmen who made and sold things by hand; these were not unfamiliar to those people; and this big city was immediately loved by the people of Shanxi.</p>
<p>I remember a serene summer night when I walked slowly along the wide and flat Xin Nanmen Street towards the heart of the city; I was surprised by the early closing of the city's shops; besides a few sparse street lamps, I was greeted only by street food vendors lighting sesame oil lamps; some selling eight-treasure porridge and sweet wine eggs; some frying meat cakes; and some selling oil tea and tangyuan. Focusing on those flickering, intimate, scattered lights, I was once again immersed in the long-lost time in my mountain village home.</p>
<p>In spring, it is the season of wind and sand in Taiyuan City; trees are sparse, and it is difficult to find any pleasing green on the dry land; looking out from the city walls? Besides the mountains, there are still distant mountains. But on clear days, flocks of swallows from the south twittered and chirped as they flew through the blue mist spewed out by the chimneys and flew towards the horizon; I thought: The south of the Yangtze River must already be full of singing orioles and growing grass.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, six years later, I have come to the south of the Yangtze River, but Taiyuan has fallen into a state of alarming plants and trees; thinking of the wind and rain in Tuancheng, no wonder I am worried.</p>
<h3>Fortunately</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>My elder brother was very ill, so we invited Dr. Zhao. My elder brother took his medicine, but his condition worsened. So we invited Dr. Qian. My elder brother took his medicine, and his condition became even more dangerous. We felt there was no hope. We then invited Dr. Sun. Dr. Sun was too busy to come. My elder brother's illness actually got better.</p>

<h3>Human Power and Horsepower</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The size of machines is calculated in horsepower. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, one horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute. What one human power can do is only one-tenth of that. Therefore, one horsepower is equal to ten human powers. This has been established as a rule, and not only ordinary people and university students believe that what is said above is accurate, but also engineers generally believe it to be true. However, Dr. Stemanzi calculated that one human power is only equal to 33 watts, and for some work, such as shoveling dirt, one human power is only equal to 15 watts. According to Kent's Mechanical Handbook, Rankin once actually tested in Scotland that a person walking up and down the stairs empty-handed for eight hours cost a total of 2,059,200 foot-pounds. Other activities such as pumping water, lifting objects, hammering nails, and pushing small carts are all different, averaging 35 watts per human power. Recently, Professor Wu Erde of Yuning University in the United States conducted various tests in China, such as carrying water, carrying weights, carrying bricks, and pumping water, averaging 31 watts per human power. Based on the above actual measurements, one horsepower must be equal to at least twenty human powers, and the saying of ten people to one horse is self-defeating.</p>
<h3>Bankrupts of Conscience</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>The professors' association of Central University recently issued a declaration, bitterly criticizing the current social and cultural crisis, in which there is a very painful passage:</p>
<p>"The current unreasonable and unfair situations force honest and law-abiding talents, if they are unwilling to drift with the tide, to suffer from insufficient food and clothing, mental anxiety, diseases without medical treatment, and even death. This is the destruction and reverse elimination of national talents."</p>
<p>The social atmosphere is becoming increasingly abnormal. If this continues, people will eventually mistakenly believe that the abnormal is normal. Habits change people, and they are irresistible. All moral precepts are insufficient to resist habits. For example, if a county magistrate who takes office empty-handed does not have a dozen loads of luggage to show off after leaving office, what kind of person will his relatives and friends think of him? — It's not that he is extravagant and clean; it's just that he must be an idiot. Considering the current treatment of county government personnel, isn't the authorities encouraging everyone to find ways to open up financial resources themselves? When a certain county magistrate in Zhejiang Province took office a few years ago, he wrote a couplet himself:</p>
<p>"Bringing a heart of sincerity;</p>
<p>Not taking a single blade of grass away."</p>
<p>This sincere heart is admirable, but honest officials are not easy to be. The execution expenses for a county magistrate to entertain visiting superiors have already exceeded the income of the incumbent staff by many times; and according to the precepts of feudal society, "when one person achieves enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." A certain county magistrate must take care of his relatives and friends besides his own life, so after he stepped down and took away three boatloads of luggage, the local gentry jointly sued him, and some busybodies even added two lines to his "famous couplet":</p>
<p>"Bringing a heart of sincerity — intending to plunder;</p>
<p>Not taking a single blade of grass away — what's the use?"</p>
<p>This story is now circulating in various parts of Zhejiang, and if someone writes a sequel to "In-Office Legal Admonitions" in the future, they will probably not forget this story. There must be many people in China who sincerely want to be good officials, perhaps they did have great ambitions at the beginning — "Bringing a heart of sincerity, not taking a single blade of grass away", but as time goes on, "habits are the most eloquent", they eventually have to surrender to "corruption".</p>
<p>Balzac said it well:</p>
<p>"Our heart is a treasure, if you empty it all at once, you will go bankrupt."</p>
<p>In such a social climate, how many people can maintain their integrity as consistently as they protect their treasury? And how many people, under the influence of customs, suddenly become bankrupts of conscience!?</p>
<h3>Ji Xiaolan's Humor</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Ji Xiaolan of the Qing Dynasty was humorous by nature. In official and unofficial history, there are many anecdotes about his jokes. For example, the poem "Once worshiped the Prime Minister's mansion as a godmother, today the godfather's surname is Liang again, the new Minister of the Ministry of Officials has a glorious family, the old Zhongtang has a desolate pool pavilion. If you are interested, you should pity the concubine, how can I have no face only for you, I personally hold one hundred and eight Manichees, and I still bring the fragrance of milky flowers when I explore it." was written by Ji to satirize a certain Tanhua who was known as a "disciple of three surnames".</p>
<p>Ji not only satirized in poetry like this, but also had a genius for pairing, and his words were as wonderful as pearls when he picked them up at will. For example, Lu Ershan visited Ji one day and said, "I just watered my horse at the Four Eyes Well, what is the antithesis for the Four Eyes Well?" He replied, "Just take your Excellency as the antithesis, how about it?" Lu couldn't help but laugh. Another example is, "During the Qianlong period, the Ministry of Works caught fire, and someone came up with the antithesis: 'The Ministry of Water has a fire, and Minister of Works Jin is building on a large scale.' Ji Wenda happened to enter the temple, and a certain secretary, who was very burly and proud of being a southerner with the appearance of a northerner, grinned and said, "A southerner with the appearance of a northerner, what kind of thing is the Secretary of the Ministry?" His humor was often like this.</p>
<p>The most humorous thing is that he once presided over a certain imperial examination, and the proctor on the left and right announced that the new champion Liu Yushu had come to pay his respects. After asking to see him, he first asked where he lived. Liu replied with "Hibiscus Nunnery". When Ji heard this, he suddenly laughed so hard that he couldn't straighten up, and then he retreated inside, unable to come out for a long time. He ordered Liu to return to his mansion temporarily, and Liu was uneasy and did not know why. He saw him again the next day and asked him the reason. Only then did he know that he had made a couplet that day: "Liu Yushu lives in Hibiscus Nunnery, Pan Jinlian makes a big fuss in the Grape Arbor." Borrowing the chapter title of Jin Ping Mei as the second line, it was seamless, and the antithesis was absolutely perfect, so he praised himself deeply, and sent the guest away halfway, making his disciples unable to understand.</p>
<p>There is also an anecdote that is also very funny. According to Qiao Dui Lu, "Colleagues were holding a spring wine party, and someone asked for an antithesis for 'Taiji produces two Yi, which produce four images'. Ji Xiaolan happened to arrive, and the colleagues said, "You are only allowed to enter after the antithesis is finished." The Duke said, "A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold. I am very hungry and have no time to compete with you." The guests all retreated."</p>
<p>In addition, the widely circulated story of "Old Xianzhu" is even more popular, and many people know it. This Duke's humorous genius is truly beyond the reach of those who ask for humor nowadays.</p>

<h3>Remembering Master Taixu</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Master Taixu and I are from the same small town, both from Chongde County, Zhejiang. But we met very late, for the first time in Chang'an Temple in Chongqing between 1943 and 1944. As soon as I saw him, I felt very close to him, because although he left his hometown when he was young, he spoke a pure Chongde dialect, and talking to him was very satisfying. Every time I entered the city, I would definitely go to Chang'an Temple to visit him. At that time, I often felt that Master Taixu before I met him and Master Taixu after I met him were completely different.</p>
<p>Before I met him, I was very surprised by the rumors I heard from others. Some people said he was a social monk, some said he was a bureaucratic monk, and some said he was a show-off monk. I didn't believe it, so I went to visit him in person. As soon as I saw him, it proved that the rumors outside were all misunderstandings. He was a true monk of orthodox faith, compassion, and vigorous diligence. I am not saying this casually. Orthodox faith means that he has a very correct understanding and belief in Buddhism. Compassion means that there is absolutely no trace of greed, anger, or delusion in his attitude. Vigorous diligence means that he has great enthusiasm for the cause of spreading Buddhism. A true monk means that in addition to orthodox faith, compassion, and vigorous diligence, he also strictly abides by the monastic precepts for decades as one day, and has the qualifications of a Bhikkhu. Every time I visited him, when I walked out of Chang'an Temple and went downhill, I sighed and admired him endlessly. I wondered, "How could Chongde produce such a person?"</p>
<p>The misunderstanding of him from the outside world was really caused by his vigorous diligence in the world. He cared about all undertakings that were beneficial to Buddhism, temples, and monks; he did not avoid difficulties or fear troubles, and he would do his best to plan, maintain, or initiate them. Anything that has a relationship with society is always bound to cause criticism, discussion, or rumors. Master Taixu's misunderstanding by some people was all caused by his enthusiasm for discussing the Dharma. But he never cared about these misunderstandings and remained vigorously diligent until his death.</p>
<p>My last meeting with Master Taixu in Chongqing was a few days before the restoration in the Zizhulin vegetarian restaurant. That day, I invited seven or eight friends who were lay Buddhists to have a farewell gathering in Chongqing. What I cannot forget is that I almost made him break the rule of abstinence from alcohol. The wine glasses and teacups in Zizhulin were the same. The wine pot was also a teapot. Everyone at the table drank alcohol, and one or two of the monks also drank alcohol. I didn't know whether Master Taixu drank alcohol or not, so I toasted him a cup to see if he would decline like Master Hongsan. Perhaps he was talking enthusiastically with the person next to him at the time and did not pay attention to my toast, and did not decline. I was surprised: "Master Taixu does not abstain from alcohol!" Then I offered the wine, Master Taixu picked up the cup, took a small sip, and quickly spat it out, and suddenly said, "It turns out it's wine, I thought it was tea." The whole table burst into laughter. I was very sorry, and I had the sin of tricking this old master. If it had been Master Yinguang, I would have been greatly scolded. But Master Taixu did not punish me. Master Taixu is no longer among people, and this regret still exists in my heart. I can only say that he was reborn in the Western Paradise. (May 9, 1940, in Hangzhou)</p>
