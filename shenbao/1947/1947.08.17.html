<h3>政府改善外匯管理　設置平衡基金委會　輸出品所得及僑匯准按照市價結算　外幣黃金仍標流通買賣</h3>
<p>〔本報京十六日電〕國行所據「改定外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法」經張院長提出後，業於十五日國務會議通過，此辦法共分兩大部份，重要內容如次：甲，由行政院依照下列原則，修訂進出口貿易暫行辦法，即日施行，（一）輸出品所得外匯及其他自國外匯入之匯款，准按照市價售結，並指定銀行。（二）輸入物品暫仍採行輸入許可制，其所需外匯除一部民生日用品准由央行供給官價外匯者外，其餘准照證向指定銀行照市價結購。前項應供官價外匯之物名，種類，由輸出入管委會隨時報請政院核定。附帶辦法，過去關於國際貿易機構有輸出與輸入兩部份，現改設輸出入臨時管理委負會，隸屬行政院。乙，由行政院以下列原則嚴格管理外匯，（一）嚴格規定指定銀行依照市價買賣外匯之辦法，（二）從嚴規定指定銀行之資格，並减少指定銀行之數目，以便稽考。（三）督促經營華僑匯款。（四）設立外匯平衡基金委員會，負責調節進出口貿易及其他合法外匯買賣之供需，以平衡外匯市價，並有附帶辦法三項，（一）嚴審派駐國外之機構與人員，（二）取締黃金投機買賣辦法，（三）禁止外幣流通辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國務會議通過之「改訂外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法」其所附帶之「禁止外幣流通辦法」要點如下：中外人民進入國境，隨身携帶外國幣券，每人得帶美金一百元或等值他國貨幣，超過者服自動向海關報明登記，以入口之日向當地中央銀行或其委託之兌換處所兌換國幣，，隱匿不報者，沒收。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電」政院為根絕外匯用於私人出國及有關工業非進出口性質之交易曾擬訂管制辦法及司掌機關約為三點，（一）政府機關申請之外匯案件，由外匯審查委會核辦，（二）核准進口所需之外匯案件，由輸出入管委會核辦，（三）敎部許可之留學生外匯案件，由中央銀行核辦。</p>
<h3>張嘉璈返滬談話　外匯新管理辦法今公布　今後可使輸出趨活躍僑匯回流</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁張嘉璈氏，，昨晨由京返滬，記者當即往訪於其　邱，探詢關於政府即將變更外匯管理辦法問題，承張氏抱病接見，並作如下之談話；「關於新外匯管理辦法，國務會議業經作原則上之通過，詳細實施辦法，則交由行政院另行擬訂，行政院十五日下午五時許召開番查委員會予以決定，全部詳細辦法，將於今日下午四時許，在中央銀行正式發表」。</p>
<p>張氏旋稱：「政府因鑒於過去官價外匯與黑市外匯差價甚大，馴至僑匯不能吸收，輸出無法推廣，而一般以官價外匯結匯輸入之物資，又多以黑市外匯價售出。處此狀態中，實不得不另謀改善辦法，藉使輸出能趨於活躍，僑匯得以回流，同時，使外匯之供需，趨於平衡」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電」改定外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法，定十七日在京，滬兩地同時公布，據接近政府人士談，此一辦法目的，在調整管理外匯辦法，俾活躍進出貿易，該項辦法極為周詳，各方面均已顧到，十五日在國務會議通過後，十六日晨行政院臨時會議復詳加研討，相信實施後其目的必能達成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電」某經濟權威十六日評中央銀行張總裁嘉璈所擬之「改定外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法」時，認此一辦法對當前經濟情况有良好影響，蓋目前之管制政策已失效果，且多弊端，若照新辦法實行，則進出口貿易可活躍多多，生產亦可增加，僑匯亦可不再逃避。此外，數目相當可觀之外人在華費用，諸如慈善，軍事，外交等費用，亦可經由指定銀行。另一良好效果，為一切走私咸可去除，聞當時曾有人主張全盤開放，惟此事影響過巨，風險太大，不若此一辦法，分開兩個步驟進行穩健多多。</p>

<h3>美致蘇聨照會全文　拒絕先由外長會討論對日和約建議</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕關於對日和的初步會戰事，美國於簽裏蘇聯之反建議時，重申其原建議之理由，美國所提之建議，為儘早召集十一國會議，草疑對日和約，在會議時，獲取各國之意見，關於此事之牒文，巳於星期三送達此間蘇聯代理公使，並由國務院於本日予以發表。按蘇聯答　美國之原建議稱：蘇聯相信召開對日和的會議一事，應先纒中·美。英。蘇四國所組成之外長會議通過。美國致蘇聯之照會全文如下：</p>
<p>本國務卿蓋請提及一九四七年七月廿二日由莫斯科美大使館轉來之蘇聯政府備忘錄一件，內開：蘇聯政府認為召開對日和約起草會議一事，必須由中·美·英·蘇四國政府代表所組成之外長會議，臨時加以檢討。美政府認為，波茨坦會議中，關於遠東和平問題之討論，對於設立之外長會議一事，不必擴大波茨坦條約所規定　於外長會議之協議，而使對日和平之解決問題，必須就正於外長會議。外長會議之設立，雖以準備對日和約為基礎，但美政府並不以為此一問題必須提交外長會議，其理由如下：在開羅宣言，雅爾達會議或波茨坦對日實言中，均無條款規定外長會議有權解決對日之和平。一九四五年十二月，列席外長會議之四國政府，在莫斯科表組成，以便擬定各種政策，原則與標準，務使遵照此等政策，履行其投降條件之義務，美政府之意見認為，此種行動已承認此等國家對於日本投降後之政策問題及和平協議且有主要之利益，因此，為太平洋其他各國之利益着想，列席外長會議之各國政府，必須承認目下考慮此種協議之會議其組繼應較外長會議為大。職是之故，美國政府認為：不論係在波茨坦所成立之外長會議，或係蘇聯政府所指出由四強組成之外長會議，均非考慮日本和約之　當機構。</p>
<p>七月十一日·美政府向遠東委員會其他十個國家提出之照會，亦即根據此項意見，在此項照會中，美國僅為徵詢各該國之意見而已，故不能親為片面行動。美國政府雖非因上述理由，而認為日本和約問題或由外長曾對論係屬不正當，但仍將蘇聯政府之意見轉陳遠東委員會各會員國，而出席外長會議各國已包括在內。</p>
<p>美國政府願意指出：關於七月十一日美國政府所提出之建議，遠東委員會九個委員均已予以答復，表示同意召開十一國對日和約會議，該項會議當可自由決定其本身之程序。</p>
<p>因此，我人深盼蘇聯政府對於考慮對日和約問題之會議，亦能表示願意參加，此項會議應於最近期內舉行，並由遠東委員會十一個國家出席參加。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十六日電〕外交官員十六日聲稱：美國刻正準備邀請遠東委員會中其他九國，開始對日和約之工作，雖無蘇聯代表參加，仍擬為之。外交官員贊成和會在九月十日左右在華盛頓召開，蓋此時正在聯合會全體大會（在紐約召開）開幕之前。</p>
<h3>魏使由穗返京　旬內赴韓考察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕魏德邁一行十六日下午五時半目穗返抵南京，聞渠等在穗工作成績未如預期理想，然對台滬之行，頗為滿意。據悉，該團將於廿四日離華飛經東京轉往韓國，行前除將晋謁蔣主席辭行外，並擬於下週末舉行鷄尾酒會，招待我政府首長及各方人士，藉作話別。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕魏特使十六日上午在美領館接見靑年黨此間領袖池在靑，中大敎授劉耀桑，章導伍，劉偉森，李一乳，馮典承等，徵詢有關該使團所調查各問題及此間文化界情形，談話內容極廣泛。魏使等一行下午二時於大雨滂沱中檢閱儀隊後登機離穗返京。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕魏特使昨接見此間民社黨領袖林正煊時，曾徵詢對目前中國政治經濟問題意見。林氏答稱：中國自信本身有能力解決目前困難，但如得美國迅速帮助，則目前困難當可迅速度過。目前困難，共產黨應負大部份責任。魏使對此項意見極表同情。魏氏復表示美國並非準備支特中國任何一黨，而係準備以友誼態度帮助中國。魏使並謂，目前中國寶處於一極有利自力更生環境中，因目前並無任何一國，有干涉到中國內政之舉。至魏使接見此間市商會理事長何輯屏時，談話內容佩重於經濟問題，會詢及華南一般工廠設備生產情形，並對粵漢路交通情形，極為注意。何氏曾提及廣東與外國發生經濟關係極早，如美商能在粵投資建設，粵人以過去經騐，當有極大發展。魏使接見敎育界民大校長吳鼎新等，曾詢及政府對學校員生進退有否干涉，及今年學潮起因，吳等答以政府對員生進退從無干涉，學潮主因為中共策動，並舉事實證明。</p>
<h3>新疆邊境發現　不明國籍飛機　據綜合判資料恢復係作非法穿中測繪</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化十六日電〕據息：新省喀什方面達強與　念接壤地帶，常有不明國籍　機出現，經多方向有關方面經悉，其詳情如次：（一）七月一日不明國　飛機兩架侵入我喀什　蒲犂縣以北布侖口西二十餘里之阿克伯爾的達板上空，盤旋約兩小時後，始向西飛去。（二）七月三日又飛來無標誌飛機一架，至布侖口上空盤旋，約四小時後飛去。（三）七月十日烏恰縣南　木上空復發現不明國籍飛機一架，盤旋約三小時，向南飛去。（四）七月十八日烏恰縣東南約八十華里之不吉上空，發現不明國籍飛機一架，盤旋約三小時餘，始向西飛去。據綜合判斷，該項飛機係作非法之空中測繪。</p>
<h3>傳魏德邁將建議　予我有條件援助</h3>
<p>〔合眾社本市訊〕接近魏德邁特使團方面聲稱，魏氏所負主要任務之一，厥為將共軍對中國之威脅及其所能危害美國遠東政策之可能性，加以倍佔計後作一報告。另據可靠方面語合眾社記者稱，魏氏及其顧問，下星期一在南京籌製報告時，將以美國對世界整個之政策審查資料，而非侷限於中國之所需。</p>
<p>駐華外交界曾會見魏氏之若干人士及魏氏之僚屬中，有一共同感覺，即特使團將向美國建議以「嚴密監視之援助」給予國民政府，惟至今除特使團顧問外，魏氏所得資料證明中共之於美國政策，實為一心腹之大患。渠寗取國民政府以其為害較小，渠願建議援助蔣主席，惟益視援助之用途，並推動國民政府之改善，而不願目覩另一蘇聯衛星之形成。（續昨—完）</p>

<p>其二京·滬兩地公敎人員配售實物辦法，已著成效，自應仍予維持，平·津兩地在未實行配售實物以前，其公敎人員各按京滬兩地本年六七兩月配售實物之平均差價，每月每人各發差價二十萬元。由於此兩項之措施，國庫每月所增負担，將及二百餘億，連上述各區基本數所增者，合計每月增加支出一千五百五十八億元。依上開辦法，此次文職人員調整後，所增待遇遇雖較本年五月間調整時所增者略少，然因此而達到文開待遇一致之目標，國庫負擔實較任何一次調整時為多，而多年以來文武職待遇之不平，一且取消，實為最大之特色。翟是文武職待遇雖已致，而文職之間待遇仍有大相懸殊者，藍國營事業人員之待遇，大都遠勝於一般公務人員，不平實甚·查前國防最高委會亦曾考慮國營事業之特殊情形，於國營事業機關人言待遇辦法中，規定「國營事業機關人員之待遇，得根據其向來習慣，自行規定，但其所得總數，不得低於各級公敎人員相當等級所得百分之二十，亦不得高於百分一十」。自該辦法頒布以來，各種國營事業能恪遵規定其人員待遇不超過公敎人員百分之一一十者，固不在少數，但若干國營事業人員，實際所得，有數倍於相當等級這之公敎人員。政府雖迭經訓飭各該國營事業遵守上述規定，將其人員待遇核減，然積重之勢，難於　返。</p>
<p>國營事業隊員　待遇決予減低</p>
<p>此次政府於調整文武職人員待遇，使其歸於一致時，對於國營事業人員待遇之超過則國坊量高委會規定範圍者，決定按照前國防最高委會規定範圍，督促實行，務使文職人員間之待遇不平與違反政府規定之事實，不復存在。此為本次調整待遇之第二特色</p>
<p>嚴標兵員缺額　軍費渭滴歸公</p>
<p>本人於此次調整文武職及國營事業人員待遇後，有兩項股切的烯望；其一，武職人員待遇，今後旣與文職一致，每人所增數目殊鉅，國庫因此負担尤重，切望各主管軍事長官，嚴令所屬，對於兵員缺額與軍費開支，務須嚴實。政府除厲行主計，審計制度外，並改善點騐辦法，務使軍費支出，涓滴為公，並杜絕浪費，深信各軍事長官部隊，均能仰體此意，切實遵行。其二，此次文職人員待遇增加基本數十萬元，自難企及物價之上界，政府深念文職人員生活之淸苦，惟當此財政支絀之秋，不得不顧慮國庫之担負，所望我文戰人員，本一貫公忠為國之精神，共體時　，是所期　。</p>

<h3>社論　外匯管制解放了</h3>
<p>中央銀行所擬改訂外匯，管理進出口貿易辦法，已於十五日經國務會議通過。其要點爲（一）開放外匯。（二）管理輸出入貿易。這是民國廿四年十一月四日以來，我國對外貿易上最重大的改革，也是國內外多數人所熟切的盼望。</p>
<p>因爲法幣政策的實施，和外匯率的確定，同於是日開始。至二十七年三月十四日，公佈購買外匯請核辦法，三十年冬，改定美匯爲二十元。三十三年一月，對僑匯及敎會美匯，改爲津貼補助金百分之一百，三十四年七月，復將僑匯津貼改爲四百八十元，合爲五百元，折合美金一元。至卅五年二月廿五日，開放外匯市塲，將美匯定爲二，〇二〇元，八月十九日，重定爲三，三五〇元，本年二月十六日，更定爲一二，〇〇〇元。但這些數字，都不過是一個官價，有頭寸的，固不願照此結售，而請外匯的，更不易照此結進。因爲黑市與官價相去過遠，致形成僵持的局面，致進出口業無法活動，外商尤　有煩會，坐令大批僑匯，紛紛改道，而走私異常猖獗，幾成公開的秘　。</p>
<p>爲打開這個僵局起見，主張外匯管制予以解除的，早已甚囂塵上，在當局雖再三否認，亦宋嘗不知道這問題的嚴重。其所以遲回審顧，不肯斷然實施，乃至不願實行進出口連鎖制，和不顧任令私有黃金　結外匯，自在力求避免刺激物價這一點上。</p>
<p>今外匯旣經開放，一般物價，自不免重起波動，以自然調整到新的水準，這是無可避免的。我們所切盼的，是：（一）指定銀行，以後對於結進或結出的外匯，務須按市價切實辦理不要多生枝節，致造成另一黑市。尤其是出口的結匯，必須儘量予以便利，以期推動輸出，而免再發生走私的現象。（二）輸入的管理必須加嚴，以免外貨傾銷，成脅民族工業的生存；（三）嚴防資金逃避，致加深經濟界的困難，（四）平價供給的民生日用品外匯，辦理時務求公開，以免國內外的指摘；（五）於可能範圍內，寬籌外匯平衡基金，以盡調節的責任。在自然水準上不必要的波動，仍須隨時防阻，以期穩定物價，安定生活；（六）對於外資的收回，和利潤的流歸，應予以種種便利，以期吸引外資，餉助建設。」</p>
<p>所可惜的是，對於出口物資，當局始終沒有確定大規模的收購政策和推銷步驟；外匯雖動，一般土貨，勢必盲目地紛紛漲價，以抵消其匯價上所得的利益。這於吸收外匯，和推廣輸出上，均將失去一種絕好的機會。</p>
<h3>美國縱容日本的又一措施</h3>
<p>日本對外私人貿易，昨天起正式開放了。當貿易開放前數日，遠東委員會公佈日本臨時進出口政策決議案一件，送盟總麥帥執行。據合衆社消息說，遠東委員會已充將一億三千七百萬元貸予日本，作爲進出口貿易之循環基金。當十四日，日本朝野正慶幸貿易開放之際，麥帥宣佈或將以五億元以上之借用借款，貸予日本，而以日本所存之金銀，作爲貿易基金，藉以充作獲取外匯的工具。日首相片山哲爲感激盟總的多方扶掖，特以驚喜的情緒，向議會作重要報告，並由議會通過致麥帥之感謝文。片山和議員們的笑逐顏開，已忘去兩年前狼狽投降的悲哀，開始追求新的前程了。</p>
<p>關於麥帥開放日本私人貿易，其對盟國的得失，我們早有論評，我國應否允諾開放日本貿易，其基本操之在我，我們曾多次陳說利　，七月廿九日本報社評，更指出日本政府及民間對於貿易開放擬具了各種遠大計劃，並希翼對外貿易之恢復，以取得美國十億大貸款，所謂戰敗國賠償義務，可能置之　後，不問不議。看幾日來的新聞報道，日本對外貿易，不僅順利開放，甚至麥帥公開宣佈貸款日本，活潑其貿易，發展其貿易。這本是我們意料巾的事，但麥帥優容寬厚日本的措施，對於盟國的權利，將是一種極大的損害，我們不能不表示異議。</p>
<p>一，我們不反對日本復興，但同盟國共同意議，應該反對日本軍國主義侵略主義的復活。看日本報紙雜誌，她們已擬定各種經濟復興計劃，增產計劃，及美國對日貸款十億美金的計劃，並以石炭增產及海運收入來塡補，貸款的償付；事實上這些生產計劃，都是資本主義經濟的復活，且可能超越一九三〇—三四年的水準，如果依這些計劃進行，日本的過剩生產，必需要龐大市塲，繼之而來的，又是掠奪與侵略。日本現有工業設備，尚未拆除充作賠償，縱使依一九三〇年水準拆除，日本工業設備仍能保持有機體，如美國貸款日本，日本再以製成品換取新的機器，是則日本新的資本主義，必蔚成大觀。很顯然的，這不是經濟復興，乃是軍國主義侵略主義因子的活，在同盟國的正義立塲，應該表示反對。</p>
<p>二，我們主張日本的賠償，除實物賠償外，應併行現金賠償辦法，因之現在封存日本的黃金珍寳，不應解封移充貿易基金。當日本投降時，盟總會封存日本約二億美元，一說價値一億四千萬美元之黃金與珍寳，依多數盟國的主張，應以此充作現金賠償，不能移充他用。所謂「現金賠償」，並非戰勝國對戰敗國的苛刻要求，是有歷史先例的。甲午中日之戰，我因戰敗香賠償日本二億三千萬兩，凡爾賽條約，德國對協約國亦履行現金賠償義務。現在。對日和會尚未召開，現金賠償問題懸而待決，今遠東委員會竟允將一億三千七百萬美元，貸予日本，大約係指解封日本黃金珍寳而言，果係有此一事，我們的判斷未錯，則盟國自毀賠償權利，對于未來的緺亂，鑿壞於冥昧之中，實難令人想像。我們站在盟國正義的立塲，應該表示反</p>
<p>現在盟國與日本和約未締結，和平狀態未恢復，美國片面行動貸款日本，誠爲不智之甚，我們中國民間報紙的態度，幷不贊同美國縱客日本的又一措施。</p>

<p>〔中央社貝德羅保利斯十五日電〕泛美會議今日下午四時在貝城「貴丹丁娜」飯店開幕，貝城位于里約熱內盧北四十英里，為巴西之夏都。美洲各國外長，自一九四五年以還，此次爲驚二次集會，以制定西半球廣泛之聯防計劇，維護美國大陸之和平與安全。本日大會開幕式，簡單隆重，其唯一目的，在使戰時美洲大陸臨時聯防計劃（即爲查甫爾特比克條約）轉爲永久性，該條約係於一九四五年墨西哥會議時締結，規定必要時得使用武力，保衛大陸之和平。巴西總統杜特拉親致開幕詞，强調會議意義之重大。今晨預備會議閉幕時，公推巴西外長費南帶期爲大會主席。烏拉圭代表提議，開停巴拉圭之內戰，阿根廷並表附議，關停之行動，可望於全體大會決定。此次會議參加者，共廿國家，尼加拉瓜未被邀請，因尼國政府於本年五月政變後執政至今，未經美洲大陸任何一國所承認。</p>
<p>〔中央社貝德羅保利斯十五日電〕泛美會議今透露參加會議各國，已同意侵略其中任何一國，即等於侵略全體各國，故各國將對侵略國採取集體行動，然目前各種跡象，已表示會議必將劇烈爭辯如何協議對侵略國採取行動之問福，其中十八個國家贊成用三分之二之表決，約束全體，阿根廷諒將爲以全體一致通過爲集體行動表決某礎之理論作辯護，此在事實上，即等于否決權，支持阿根廷理論之國家，僅有海地一國。消息靈通之觀察家認爲此次會議，或將以反共爲方針，蓋美洲已潛伏共產主義之威脅也。</p>
<h3>關於西半球聨防條約　馬闡明美立塲　主張採取集體行動對付侵略者</h3>
<p>〔中央社貝德羅保利斯十五日電〕馬歇爾今日下午於泛美會議開幕後所舉行之記者招待會上，公開宣佈美國對於即將於此間簽訂之西半球聯防條約中關於動員防務以案分之二表決制爲準一節所持之立塲。馬氏稱：美國代表團將提議在查甫爾特比克決議案曾經特別規定之集體措施經由諮詢以三分之二票決獲得協議時，將為所有締約國之共同遵守義務。唯一之例外，即任何國家如未經其本身之允許不得向其强求供給軍隊。渠幷宜佈多數美洲國家於答覆關於擬議中之條約，表示同意集體措施之決議，應爲所有締約國之共同遵守義務。按查甫爾特比克決議案規定亦有締約國必須利用各種方法，如斷絕外交關係或商業關係以及最後一着使用武力，俾一致阻止或打擊侵略者。</p>
<h3>國際管制原子能　蘇建議遭否決</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十五日電〕蘇聯企圖在聯合國大會於九月間舉行以前，使其關於原子能管制之建議，爲聯合國機構所接受，已於今日遭遇最後之失敗。聯合國原子能委會政委會之十二　委員，頃以十票多數通過加拿大之決議案，確認蘇聯之原子能國際管制計劃，在其現在方式下並不適當。政委會今旣面臨顯然不能克服之優局，決定休會至八月廿五日復會，討論原子能委會向安理會提出之第二報吿。</p>

<h3>美對韓政策不變　霍奇所採政策與華府並無衝突　勃朗指責蘇方破壞商談</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕美國務院今宣稱：美國對朝鮮之政策，始終如一，即保證朝鮮將成爲一自由，團結之宗主國家，建立代表民意之民主政府是也。朝鮮方面傳美司令霍奇所追隨之政策，與此間所閘明者不同，實屬不確。美對韓祗有一種政策，霍奇將軍在複雜而困難環境下忠實予以執行。目前除國會已撥款陸軍部援助朝鮮之外。華府政府機構茲與霍奇將軍密切合作，完成有關之研究，以便進一步援助朝鮮。</p>
<p>〔薪亞社漢城十六日電〕美蘇混合委員會美代表勃朗少將頃發表聲明稱：目前混合委員會之陷入僵局，實由於蘇方堅持必須在小組會中製作政黨及社團名簿，此點頗似實行否決權，然蘇方對其所主張應除去諮詢資格之團體，又不能提出充份之證據。依蘇方主張，朝鮮政黨團體之左右執力應爲三與二之比，即左派須佔絕對優勢，此事似頗不公正。</p>
<h3>越局將有新發展　戰事有結束可能　波拉特返國向總理報告</h3>

<h3>安理會續辯印尼問題　荷代表四面楚歌　菲代表當塲宣布正式承認印尼</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十五日電〕安理會辯論印尼問題已歷時兩週，迄至本日，辯論主題可歸納於下列一點，即聯合國在法理上是否可處理荷蘭政府所新爲「純係內政」之事項。安理會今晚未就此　進行正式表決，美代表詹森曾建議安理會立即休會，暫不就此問題有所決定，此項建議業經通過。詹森發言前，澳代表猛烈抨擊殖民國家，謂其一再指責安理會之法理權限，藉以阻止理事會對印尼問題採取行動。荷代表曾率直表示安理會無處理荷印衝突之能力，荷代表克利芬斯稱，荷蘭政府將永不間意安理會調查荷印衝突，並建議兩點：（一）印尼及荷蘭各選一國，再由此二國選擇一公正之第三國，依賴此三國之善意斡旋，從而向世界報吿印尼之情勢。（二）駐留巴達維亞之一切「職業領事」，應即時就印尼局勢草擬共同報吿。菲律賓代表則宣佈菲政府今日正式承認印度聯邦巴某斯坦及印度尼西亞，渠復强硬辯護安理會有權處理印尼問題，並請安理會即時採取行動。菲律賓支持澳洲之提議，波蘭復支持菲律賓。</p>

<h3>第一綏靖區司令部發表　破獲共匪間諜機關　主從犯十一名在滬落綱　搜出文件書籍情報原底假鈔甚夥</h3>
<p>第一綏靖區司令部頃發表破獲共匪軍事間護機關案，經過如下：第一綏靖區司令部自去年七月被迫　擊軍蘇北共匪以來，綜合各方情報，匪方在上海設有軍事間諜機構，專事偵察國軍行動兵力數量，隨時傳運匪軍，預為布置，兼作危害國軍行動，組織規模龐大。嗣復查悉：「中共華中政治分局聯絡部上海市特派員』盧志英，即係蘇北共匪軍事間諜機勝之主特人，復於各項情報中，獲得盧匪行踪，住址及其掩護機關，以盧匪等黨羽密布，耳目極靈，為迅速破獲，以免洩漏起見，乃分派幹員馳赴上海，將盧志英密捕，並在巨發萊斯路德安里八號三樓慮志英住所搜出大批文件，書籍，情報原底及偽造之票面五百元二千元法幣二百萬元。並在其　護機關大東食品店，偉達食品公司，瑞聚成食品公司等地，捕獲其黨羽盧克緒。傅有齋·陳惠和，吳秀珍，吳寶琳·莊楓·姚永祥·楊瑩·孫毅强·佘廣德等多名，搜出大批文件書籍印別獲等物。</p>
<p>盧志英罪行</p>
<p>綜合所護文件，查得盧志英罪行，（一）於蘇北主持共匪軍事間諜，刺探軍情，危害我軍事行動。（二）偵查我軍行動香號數量供給匪軍，作不利我軍之行動。（三）偷運彈藥槍砲接濟匪軍作戰。（四）私運物資外銷，套購軍用品原料，供給匪軍延長叛亂。（五）建立上海暴動特工組織，並負責向東北靑島南京浙江台灣香港廣東等地發展，佈置特務網。（六）打人各軍政機關從事反閒工作。（七）購買各種軍用電話電訊材料運往蘇北各地，供給匪用。（八）印制大量偽鈔，破壞金融。（九）設置沿海各縣交通聯絡工作。（十）策動各種暴動謀釀成血案，以為藉口。（十一）企圖策動叛變。查盧志英等此種行動實觸犯刑法內亂罪，危書國家罪，偽造貨幣罪，其首從人犯均經陸續捕獲。第一綏靖區司令部以盧等罪行昭著，實無可遣，不得不予以逮捕，以根絕共匪險謀。惟以案情重大，逮捕之後，偵察需時，以期無枉無縱，故延至現在始行公布。至盧志英等正在依法訊判中云。</p>
<h3>在滬活動　共匪兩名就逮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕阜寗縣政府上月有電致淞滬警備司令部，內稱擾鄕長楊殿英報告，黃匪惠明幹，返反自新條例　，與匪黨惠盛茂同逃來滬，住於專明甫家中，惠明幹曾殺死國民黨員周為呂，地主惠明領，戴元峯，請就近緝捕。該部又據惠祖佐報告，稱惠明幹與渠有殺父之仇，經警部偵得惠在閘北大通路一帶，喬裝修理三輪軍，經派探警前往拘獲，供稱：受新四軍駐滬負費人張步達指揮，做情報工作，繼將張步達捕獲，昨晨由警部將惠，張兩犯，解送地檢處偵查。</p>
<h3>匪俘孫秉成　沉痛訴往事　所謂解放區　實係活地獄　十四齡小兵不敢寫家書</h3>
<p>東北共匪俘虜首批一千七百九十九名，於十五日下午乘海宙號輸押解抵滬，候輪赴武昌集中受訓，上海各報社記者於昨日上午十時特赴虬江碼頭登海宙輪訪問該批俘虜。彼等均對目前所受優渥待遇，表示驚異而感謝，並證明彼等認國軍為野蠻者，係中惡毒之宣傳。一在八路軍服務八年之匪黨黨員，曾任縣政府秘書與通指導員名孫乘成者，於痛述匪黨罪行後，以眞摯之情緒宜稱：「渠今後將永遠站於政府之一邊，與共黨誓不兩立，渠將於正義之立場上，向世界控訴渠過去强迫所受之麻醉敎育」！</p>
<p>恩想遭受統制</p>
<p>孫為山東泰安縣人，原名孫殿臣，現年廿七歲，曾受高小敎育，後在匪方建國學校及濱海中學畢業。抗戰初期，在其故鄉當遊擊隊員，後為匪軍遊說而加入匪方，一九四〇年正式為匪黨員，在山東各地作戰，後隨匪軍潛至關外。被俘時渠為匪方遼東軍區獨立第一師（師長名吳端林，）之連指導員，自稱過去種種，均係受欺騙，思想被統制，行動受約束，一切不自由。</p>
<p>被俘為幸運事</p>
<p>現則已自黑暗重睹光明。渠表示：如予渠以機會，願參加國軍作戰，為收復整個山東充「先鋒」。孫並以參與匪軍叛亂多年之實際感受，向眾宣佈：匪軍除若干頑固之老幹部外，士兵階級無不厭戰，但匪方幹部管制極嚴，脫逃之機會不多，故無不認被俘為幸運之事，匪軍士兵生活極苦，每月薪餉僅匪幣五十元，不够買兩包者烟。兩黨官員多貪污舞弊之事，彼等所竭力從戰之階級〔爭，巳使富者逃亡，貧者仇恨，所謂「解放區」實係人間「活地獄」。</p>
<p>熱淚奪眶而出</p>
<p>另有一名李樹恒者，年償十四齡，哈爾濱人父母兄弟姊妹俱全，當渠於今年初在某私塾中念書時，為匪軍抓去充當傳達兵，渠家人現均不知渠之下落。此一小兵天眞爛澡，告記者渠思家甚切，但現在不敎寫一信通知家中，蓋深恐為匪方知悉，而盡屠其家人，言時熱淚，已不禁奪眶而出。</p>

<p>行總發言人昨對日前報載有關行總被檢舉之各點，發表說明「事實眞相」之畫面文告，其全文如下：「某通訊社所傳所謂攻訐本署消息，首謂「電扇實配僅一萬餘架，而行　購銷處報稱已銷二萬餘架，其中一萬餘架，即為貪污者所侵吞』。查本署購銷處最近出售之電扇，係美海軍剩餘船用電扇，行聯總聯席分配會議認為不合市場需要，分別零售恐無銷路，經議決登報標賣，前後三次公告標賣僅售出五百只，而第二三次公告投標竟無人問津。</p>
<p>停售電扇經過</p>
<p>為出清積貨遂試行登報零售，因定價低廉，每只僅四十萬元，購者爭先恐後，門市擁擠，秩序混亂。各機關來請購函亦達五百餘封。本署為避免爭購風波，經決定停止門市，改為免費配予各有關需用機關，計交通部免費配與一千八百只，各醫院兩千只，門市售出計七千六百餘只，其餘小額免費分配，均有配單為據。當時因突然停止門市，講者向隅，謠縣紛起，監察使署已派員來署調查，日內當可查明眞相。至謂招商局請購二百架，該處迫使招商局於申請書上改為三百架，而實配僅二百架」云云，招商局有案可稽，本署毋庸答辦</p>
<p>棉花換紗問題</p>
<p>（二）所說謂「棉花換紗問題」；查本署出售聯總美棉與各廠商，行政院核定採取以棉易取各廠紡成紗的辦法，經本署會同聯總及經濟部紡管會商決，依據防紗實際需要原料量及工繳與花紗市價為標準，定為以外棉七六〇磅換廿支張江四百磅自瘊定以來，業經行政院備案，即循例　辦理。至謂登賬與規定不符，事實上各廠收貨數量，自有磅碼單為憑。所傳九十磅落入貧污之手，實屬無稽。</p>
<p>小麥出粉比例</p>
<p>（三）所謂小麥之滲水之技術間題，為事實上不可能之事，按本署接到聯總美麥，係交由上海福新等各粉廠代磨統粉。規定以一百斤美麥交粉廠應出統粉九十斤，麩皮八斤，其餘二斤為廠方磨粉之損耗。此種出粉比例及合水份之百分率均經聯總專家估定。磨粉出品須經聯總專家經常直接抽查檢騐，從未設現水份過多之事，如水份增多，則麵粉於短期內即發霉成塊矣。現各廠尙有存粉，經久不霉，事實俱在，不待贅述。謠傳每石加水五斤，五斤盈餘，貪污侵吞」，不攻自破。</p>
<p>運費原有折扣</p>
<p>（四）所謂運輸抽　，純為誤解之說。查本　物資屬於救濟性質，故與各交通機關商定减低運費之折扣辦法。凡國營民營之中國輪船公司承運本署之物資，均依照指商局貨運價目表打七五折收運費，鐵路運價於去年十月底以前，亦按七五折計算。去年十一月起，則按特約專價計算，每噸公哩四十五元，今年七月增為一百卅五元，所謂折扣，並無佣金，乃承運人依規定减收本署運費，以减輕本署之支出。</p>
<p>房屋冰箱煤斤</p>
<p>（五）建國西路五七〇號房屋，為本署署長副署長宿舍，並非李卓敏副署長一家獨住。室內冰箱係舊房主之遺物，並非聯總物資。本署普通職員宿舍均派有管理及僕役，建國西路宿舍經常僅有工役五人。所謂每日用煤兩噸，查與事實不符。至於該通訊謠傳「李副署長拒絕撥款振濟粵災，却擠五億元為職員租貸宿舍」，顯無事實根據。粵災賑款五億元早經匯粵發放，本署從無以五億巨款租房</p>
<p>汽車係屬公用</p>
<p>又該通訊社所發消息，涉及漁管處處長胡可時，查胡長於上週始奉命接管漁管處，到任尙不及一週。至稱「總務處長徐世長有自備汽車三輛之多」，係誤指總務處所管理之公用汽車，徐氏個人並無自備汽車，市府公用局脾照冊可供查攷。　上述各節，本署均有詳細單據賬冊可為對證。本署行政概遵分層負責之原則，各層職員均分負其本身崗位上之行政責任，甚盼監察機關來署分別調查，以明事寶」。按胡可時在接管漁管處之前，為行總務處　前任處長。</p>

<h3>榕記者團抵達古田　參觀水力發電工程</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十六日電〕榕記者團日前應省應之邀，赴閩北古田參觀古田溪水力發電工程，昨深晚返榕。閩北公路破爛不堪，路面多爲山洪冲毀，記者坐於吉普車中，沿途顚簸一三六公里，到達目的地。古田匪氛甚熾，共匪和平救國軍某支隊左豐美所部，人槍二百餘，注竄於該縣邊境，日前曾刦糧倉四所。記者於將抵縣城時，尤聞兵匪激戰之槍聲。記者在工程人員指引下，於山道羊徑中步行出發龜瀨及曹洋兩處，參觀水電工程及龍亭瀑布設渠地段，龍亭瀑布位於叢山深谷中，戔花高濺，有如薄霧，縣瀑飛沫，蔚爲奇觀，該項工程浩大，異日完工，當爲閩省工業化之一大動力？</p>

<h3>石福海在津慘遭暗殺　兇犯俄人賴柴供認不諱</h3>
<p>〔本報天津訊〕上海中國大陸機器公司華經理石福海，（三十一歲，南京人，）偕該公司副理賴柴，（蘇聯人，二十四歲，）於上月十四日携新型縫製文件機器一批，由滬來津推銷。八月八日晨，石忽於在津所寓之第一注大旅館泰來飯店中被人暗殺，兇手業經判明，即係與石同來之賴柴。血案發生之際，（八日晨三時）石福海所居泰來飯店一零五號房隔壁一零六　旅客，瀋陽第二工科學生王志平及其妻郭玉芬，突於睡夢中被隔壁之聲響所驚醒，並聞有人哎呀一呼，旋即寂無所聞，同時隔壁一零四號旅客女伶鄭素貞，亦被慘呌聲警醒。常特曾向窗外大街探視，惟並無發現，乃亦未予繼續注意。晨七時，賴柴携半奶一瓶，麵包一枚自外而來，呼茶役啓一〇五號入內，旣睹石福海已橫死床頭，遂將手中牛奶麵包驚隊於地，呼呌而出，逕投警察第十分局報案。</p>
<p>警局據賴柴報案，當時即發現賴柴衣手谷部均有血痕，繩之詳加檢查，見賴柴左耳後，手臂，右腮，均有抓傷，左腿，前腹，雙手有血痕，右手心有緊特器具之紅印，左手中指，食指，手臂有刃物傷，右腿後下方有錐形新傷，訊其行踪，則言語支吾，張惶不已，警局當即認定賴柴具有重大嫌疑，乃扣押詳訊。賴柴終於全盤供出殺害石福海不諱。至賴柴將如何發落，常局正在核辦中。</p>
<p>石福海爲回敎徒，其屍體經警局掩埋後，滬回敎協會曾電平回敎協會轉請津分會請求警局准許，將石之屍骸移葬津回敎義地。一切等後，正待石福海之父自滬來津料理。據悉：石與賴柴久即不合。彼等抵津後，石　海之父及妻，會頻頻自滬來函，　石對賴柴嚴加防範，不料終未能免此慘劇。</p>

<h3>警察總署　刑事實騐室內幕　神秘的九組·靈活的表演　說謊偵察機足以使犯人戰憟　警犬能搜索到暗藏的火柴匣</h3>
<p>〔本報駐京記者定遠十五日訊〕刑事警察在歐美各國極普遍，在中國尙是創舉。顧名思義，刑事警察還是在「實騐」階段，即使是實騐，也還祗有一年的歷史。去年八月十五日，內政部警察總署成立時，刑事實騐案在唐縱署長的主持下，開始接收前中美合作所的器材，運到南京。</p>
<p>刑事警察的任務，主要的是犯罪的預防和偵查，而以罪證的搜集與鑑定爲第一步工作。在科學昌明的今天，犯罪者技巧日增，搜集鑑定罪證，必賴科學設備和技術的配合。說來可憐，刑事實騐室所有的設備，雖使二百名光景的警員忙碌不堪，比起美國來，不過是一個州警察局的規模。充其量，這點設備祗够江蘇省一省使用，可是我們的省內交通如何和美國州內交通相比？現在，這點設備還是全國唯一呢。像上海灘上，每天犯罪的事實不知道有多少，如果能把這套設備搬到上海去用，相信一定可以預防若干罪案發生，或使罪案迅速破獲。黃金掮客余盛孝案的破獲，不就是刑警設備的功效嗎？</p>
<p>十五日下午五至七時，</p>
<p>唐縱署長招待與警察有密切關係的司法界和新聞界人士參觀刑事實騐室，當作警察總署成立一週年的紀念。在許多位負責人的指引下，我們陸續參觀了理化·技術·電器·照相·指紋·法醫·警犬等八組，祗有警鴿組沒有參觀。這九組，是構成刑事實騐室的基幹。一會兒，我們似走入醫院，一會兒，我們又像進了理化實騐室。負責人一面在講述，一面在揩頭上的汗珠。空氣是新鮮的，佈置整潔，各室工作人員一律穿着白制服，很像醫院裏的大夫。　値得注意的是；理化組的天秤，有一架的準確度萬分之一。當試騐進行的時候，</p>
<p>一根頭髪也在天秤上表現出牠的重量了。這是爲了衡量最輕微的毒物而準備的。技術組有一架說謊偵察機，那是可以令犯人戰慄的東西。測謊原理是根據人身所負電的反應心理與生理的相互關係。測謊器所得的效果，通常達百分之七十五，不過測謊者的經騐學識很有關係。據說全世界祇有兩架，除這裏一架外，還有一架在美國。电氣組的放錄音機，目的是防犯人反供，當塲錄音，當時即能放出。陶希聖副部長應該組負責八之請，作五分鐘關於採證鑑定的講演。一分鐘後，我們第二次聽到他在那裏講話了。照相組的X光設備，是是輕便的機器，可以隨時移動搬運，適於到「現塲」去拍照。騐槍組的「比較顯微鏡」，會根據一顆彈壳或彈頭，及一支嫌疑槍，斷定牠是否有嫌疑。在</p>
<p>顯微照像之下，彈頭或彈壳上的紋路便是鐵證。指紋組的設備，現在應用很廣，這裏有一種較特殊的設備，是屍體撩印盒。屍體的手指是倔僂的，無法捺印，可是三種藥水使屍體的指紋與活人的指紋無異。</p>
<p>警犬部份作「現塲表演」，這些警犬訓練有素，牠會營救警員，用牙齒咬斷捆人的繩索，牠會實行「現塲搜索」，會在許多隻行李中發現藏有雅片的皮箱，牠會實行「案犯追蹤」，根據路綫上的足跡，牠竟尋到一個陌生者所載起的火柴盒。警犬的表演，極富興趣，同時給參觀者留下了一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>這些設備，說得上是「天羅地網」了。不論你如何巧妙地犯罪，你將難逃這些補人力之不足的儀　設備所佈就的羅網。如今，唐縱署長很有</p>
<p>擴充設備的雄心，他希望能使刑事警察分佈到各地，使目前社會上最易發生的罪案，將因刑事警察遍佈而大爲减少。誰願意以身試法呢？刑事實騐室的各項設備，沒有一件東西會放鬆罪犯。</p>
<p>在刑事實騐室參觀兩小時，看到各種設備和儀器，聽到各種解釋與說明，當最後一個節目參觀完畢時，心下在想：「從今以後，犯法的人們將絕對不敢犯法了。」</p>
<p>犯罪减少，是社會的一種進步。希望警察總署在刑事警察方而有更大的成功。</p>

<h3>政府將採取津貼津貼制度　解救出口業危機</h3>
<p>津貼辦法行政院在審核中</p>
<p>自官價外匯與黑市價格發生差異後，出口業即遭受嚴重之打擊，而陷於停頓狀態。政府爲解救出口業之危機，特採收購政策，藉資推動出口。惟收購對象，僅限於桐油猪鬃茶絲蛋羊毛等七種主要物資。七種以外之出口物資，輸出推廣會已擬定具體辦法，政院核示，政院正審核中。聞原則決定採津貼制度，由商人自行出口。因官方人士認爲謀求國際收支之平衡，鼓勵輸出，爲當前唯一重要課題。故凡能出口者，均應設法扶助出口，以爭取外匯，爲最大目約。七種主要物資以外，採取津貼辦法者，全在取得外匯。一般相信，如果實現以後，我國際貿易當有轉機，對國際收支之平衡，亦有莫大之帮助。</p>

<p>牌價不動</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會昨日召開會議結果，決定各支紗仍維持本週五三脾價，不予調整。</p>
<p>紗價軋漲</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以隔日市氣昂騰，開時塲內賣戶觀望，客帮納意轉殷，本街需要亦健，市盤頓吿上揚。詎至收時，以浮多了結吐售，價稍回軟，終以軋漲居多。</p>
<p>最後四二支藍鳳一千七百二十萬元，比上日續漲四十萬。三十二支藍鳳亦昂至一千三百七十萬元，軋升二十萬。二十支特雙馬一千一百入十萬元，亦升三十萬。輕雙馬一千零五十萬，升二十萬。十六支光明粗紗爲九百四十萬元，上揚三十萬。其他四二支四十去及二十支十六支十支等粗細紗，一致軋升一二十萬至四五</p>
<p>棉布轉堅</p>
<p>昨日棉布，初開時價均在低檔徘徊，旋以津漢及粵帮客人逢低收納，本街亦較活潑，大戶則抱特貨不脫主義，散戶則高吐低吃，而紡建公司仍以低檔細布開售，致貨主更形堅持，市况在拉提情勢下，各貨由疲轉堅</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布最後價爲四十四萬二千元，比上日軋升二千元，五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴振中等各細布，則回跌二三千至五六千。士林布高檔挺升一萬至五萬元，細斜粗布市亦步昂二三萬元，其餘各布互見升沉。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售三一一二零疋，申購單共九五七張。內廠商十四戶，購布一三二〇疋。布號九四三張，購布二九八〇〇疋。</p>
<p>昨白坏掛牌爲二十支三九碼七五之特細布一種，價爲三十四萬元。雷峰塔嗶嘰四十二萬六千元，申購甚多。聞十二點半後，成交龍頭細布週一出貨價四十四萬六千五百元。四君子元　嘰爲四十六萬四千元，搜購者仍多。</p>
<p>現棉挺升</p>
<p>棉花昨日市况，因棉紗再吿上揚，人心振奮，紗廠開價亦較上日略高，交易轉旺，趨勢堅挺，後市一致看好，執貨者尙欲待善價而售。午後成交反少，價格一致挺升，各檔成交約一千餘包。靈寳做開送廠價二〇五萬，二〇六萬，二〇九萬，二一〇萬，二一一萬，沙市二〇五萬，山東木架二〇四萬，棧交價靈寳二〇五萬，紗市一九四萬，一九七萬，周浦籽花三〇萬三千。</p>
<h3>產地價格挺升　食米略形緊俏</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧三千七百餘石，產地挺升，隨之影響，粳秈續升三五千至萬元，白陰元均漲萬元。新粳到銷兩平，暫無呼吸。崑山新議秈今日初次到申，際此天晴出品甚佳，售開爲三一十三萬元。溧陽新埠幣續有到申，而南京句客溧水浦鎭等處新秈一不日即將到滬，後形不致過於上漲麺。粉漲跌互見，洋粉去胃異常活潑，步砌三四千元。廠粉微升千餘元，雜脾粉平平，統粉則去化不振，回挫三四千元。醬園去路亦然寥寥，麩皮執貨者心思甚堅，略升三五百至千元。豆餅客銷動而不爽，形居平庸之狀。黃豆乍升乍降，甚難捉摸，來貨不及前日湧旺，本街零化添補尙殷，回昂三五千元。</p>
<p>豆南洋揀巧拾取，漸甦之象，轉振三五千元。紅糧站立，芝蔴仍無變動，生仁華南略進，本街亦有納胃，盤漲萬餘元。蠶豆客方本街均少交易，挫跌二三千元。赤豆貨稀堅穩，苞米新貨尙未見湧，黃渡新苞亦將到申，形勢平疲。莞豆汕頭續吸，步漲萬餘元。小麥堅挺之格。</p>
<p>油市升沉不一，生油產價堅昂，微升三五千元。豆油則依然供過於求，績疲萬元。菜油消化平常，重慶桶菜油彷彿，廠菜油回挫萬餘元。惟蔴油蚌埠來貨見减，飛漲三四萬元。</p>
<h3>食糖上漲未已</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢依然堅緊，繼續向一上。公會劃盤二〇中砂白五十九萬八千元，升萬元。台赤六十一萬五千元，升五千元。四半白七十二三萬元，升二萬元。秘魯砂較平，爲六十六萬元。汕提靑四十九萬元，升一二萬元。次之四十七萬元，油次者四十五萬五千無，計二百餘包。與化白袋　六十四萬元，升萬元，簍裝六十二萬元，計三百餘件。刁靑開三百餘包，仍爲四十一萬元。</p>
<h3>川帮行莊近况　共計二十六單位</h3>
<p>本市目正和巴川兩銀行宣吿停業後，一般人對於川帮行莊，極爲注意。據目前來滬之重慶市銀行公會理事長范衆渠氏談，截止最近爲止，在滬設立分行之川帮銀行，計有銀行二十一家，錢莊三家，銀號一家，銀公司一家，共計二十六個單位。銀行二十一和成，重慶，聚興誠，四川農工，永成，建設，怡豐，　泰豫，大裕，山心，通惠，川監，濟康，華康，其昌，福川，匯通。錢銀號爲永裕。銀公司爲四川興業。各行莊營業均極審愼云。</p>
<h3>燃管會昨集議　加速煤斤運輪</h3>
<p>燃料管理委員會，昨日邀請京滬，平漢，浙贛三鐵路及招商局市公用局舉行會議，商討加速煤斤運輸問題。據該會稱，過去每月運滬煤斤約十五萬噸，其中來自台灣約五萬噸，來自開灤煤礦十萬噸。本月份迄目前爲止，運滬煤斤已達七萬餘噸，因加强北寗路運輸，本月份起開灤運滬煤斤可增至十五萬噸。該會統配處孫處長估計本年冬季本市配煤，較現在每月可增配兩萬噸，即十七萬噸，故煤荒可吿無慮。又長江區湖南湖北江西安徽等地，准煤商自由採購後，各地煤斤均不斷有運滬者。最近經本市煤商自漢運滬之煤斤，即有兩萬噸，此可爲近日煤價疲滯之主要原因。又本市第三次民生用煤，本月下旬該會即可配出，數量仍爲五千噸。</p>
<h3>生絲出口虧蝕甚鉅</h3>
<p>頃據關係方面稱，我國各種出口貨物，運銷國外，均須虧蝕。如以猪鬃桐油腸衣等計算，約差百分之五十，茶葉則差百分之一百，而生絲差價尤鉅。以本年春繭縷絲成本每担約在三千八百五十萬元，而外銷雖有交易，奈價格殊廉。五担至十担以上者，每磅約爲美金五元左右，以每担一三三磅，照官價匯率一萬二千元折合，每担僅値國幣七百九十餘萬元。如在一百担以上之交易，每磅僅値美金三元餘，平均以每磅美金四元計算，每祖生絲外銷，至少須虧蝕百分之六百。本年春蘭貸款一千六百億元，繅工貸款一千億元，再加拆息及廠商一成墊頭，總額約在四千九百億元左右。產絲量共計一萬四千祖，每祖成本爲三千八百五十萬元，與國外售價每磅美元四元折合每担僅値六百餘萬元，故此四千九百億元之成本總額，照售價僅能收回八百餘億元，且尙不知延至何日，方可全部售出。即以去年政府收置之生絲而言，由中信局運往美國銷售，迄今僅出一千餘担。至於秋繭貸款，當局現未核定，如以八千担產絲量而言，及以每担三千八百五十萬元成本計算，需款總額約在三千一百億元，則春秋繭緤絲之成本，總計共達八千億元之巨，江浙兩省農村昆通都市，春斯繭貸籌碼業又重行流入都市，足以影響物價上漲一大因素，故當局對此正加詳細研究中。</p>
<h3>政院批示未到達前　人絲暫維上週牌價　絲織業請願代表已返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局人造絲配價昨日經該局業務主管人員會議」過，決定在政院批示未到達前，仍暫維上週之掛牌價。即東洋大富貴二二四〇萬元，其他如天橋，高山，金本馬等，仍爲二二三〇萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：絲織業赴京請願代表蔡昕濤劉慶一等，業已由京返抵滬，據蔡等談稱：中樞各當局對於要求减低人造絲配價事，均極表同情，允對呈請各節，予以考慮，並囑先返滬與中信局接洽。本擬昨日赴中信局談判，因吳任滄尙未返滬，故將改至星期一前往，届時雙方將詳經檢討，或即可獲解決云。</p>
<p>人絲轉榮</p>
<p>又訊：人造絲市况淸淡，但人心轉榮，下午又見上升。上午一二〇號高山有光開盤二千五百七十萬元，中午收盤六百萬元，下午初無變化，最生竟有喊價六百五十萬元，正式行情爲六百二十萬元，比目日價大五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經平穩</p>
<p>廠經昨市上午頗平穩，然因週六關係，故喊價均比上日夫五十萬元之譜。高勻度仍乏人過問，另担貨成交價與上日相同，下午八心較昂，喊價比上午又增，但無正式交易。　綢價回挫</p>
<p>綢貨被面連朝高翔，昨市挫跌，華强貨開市後四十九萬及五十萬元均有成交，週一期大五萬元，後因供求失衡，節節下降，最小即期價四十三萬元。九時後又吿上升，回高至開市時原一盤，最後終以賣多復挫，收市價爲四十五萬元，週一期四十九萬元，較上日跌去二十萬元強。大誠貨比華强大起十萬元左右，格子璧縐價喊四千五百元，殊乏成</p>
<h3>國藥疲挫</h3>
<p>國藥一度堅挺，旋以去化不暢，來客添配，數額微小，且不成件，以致復又趨疲。業中人大感苦悶，市塲交易極形寂寞，爲歷年未有之清淡。</p>
<h3>市塲謠傳紛紜　華股先疲後堅</h3>
<p>華股昨疲態甚暫，經過北帮少壯派，以及證券帮中活動份子多頭加碼，經過若千努力後，局勢頓告改觀，空方被迫抵補，於是謠傳紛紜，股市遂脫頴而出，離物資而單騎疾進。除華豐搪瓷受某種糾紛之影響，特股者恐慌，每况愈下，獨跌一成半之多外，餘股則一致挺進，商務更漲到限度。午後不普遍之塲外交易，　續喊高，良以外匯及幣制之謠風更盛也。</p>
<p>晨開時承前收後之餘風，並受國行差進影響，開低較多。遞永紗開後，仍遭浮多壓迫，現遞均見二二〇元低價。九七號一八六號一六號八五號有買，而見微升，二三五號趁高了結。成交極少，市氣尙難大振。迨九時半後，經一八六號二二六號一七七號之購買現永紗，二三號二二四號一六號九四號三二號均進，而回升至二二七元及二三〇元。二三五號八三號一五八號二一九號賣出，尙跌至二二五元。二二三號一六號一一七號一八六號八五號七六號一〇五號三六號二〇七號一五八號買意仍健，一六三號二三二號並進現永紗。十時半後，少壯派一六三號力事拉抬，軋空遂起。</p>
<p>十一時後，永紗步漲到二三五元及二三六元，美亞亦得一四九號九五號之買進而亦拉高。一三〇號趁高了結，現永紗二〇七號一八六號亦有脫手，而轉低少許，然因人心已好，外匯之調整及黃金自由賣買等謠紛起，三二號四號二四號一六三號一一七號八九號八號再進，一六三號一五七號買進現永紗。十一時二十分，商務由一五七號拉高至漲停板，永紗亦漲到二三六元及二四〇元高價，僅華豐有特殊之不利消息，持有者恐慌，一四七號力售現華豐，跌勢反而加强。臨收前七六號二三五號一四號一一二號一五七號一八號趁高了結，回跌至二三〇元及二三二元，一六三號仍納現永紗，午收現永紗以二三四元，遞永紗以二三二元收市，形成倒掛。</p>

<h3>扇話</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>自明以後，以蘇州與四川所製作約最佳。專制的時代，以龍鳳百鳥之屬象徽君</p>
<p>扇的種類，有團扇，摺扇之分。對扇的稱謂，關以東呌做「　」，關以西纔呌作「扇」。</p>
<p>團扇發明極早，年代已不可稽攷；而摺扇則自元朝以後才有，它的來源乃來自高麗。是被當作質物，流入中國的。不過，那時的名稱，呌做「聚頭扇」，因爲便於袖藏緣故，至明永樂以後始流行漸廣。</p>
<p>明代的　子，多以金粉飾其上，即是皇帝賜予羣臣的，它的面子亦均是金色製成的。至在扇面揮洒翰，則在明憲宗以後的事。今之售古書畫者，如有以扇面摺頁誑稱明初名公之作品，待價而沽的話，則絕對係膺品無疑。幸購客勿上當也。</p>
<p>自日以後，以蘇州與四川所製作的最佳。專制的時代，以龍鳳百鳥之屬象徴君主及后妃，所以當時宮掖所用的扇子，其扇骨及面均綴以正龍，側能，百龍，或百鳥的裝璜，非常璀璨可觀。唯價格也極昂，一柄値數金，甚至有專因製扇而成名的，如馬勛·馬福·沈少樓。蔣蘇台等，多是明代被譽爲名手的。</p>
<p>淸代康熙間，由各地貢進裏去，得大皇帝賞識的，計有金陵仰氏扇，伊氏素紙扇；繼又有青陽扇，武陵夾紗扇，曹廟，靴鼠，溧陽歌扇等。嬉遞到現在，芭蕉製成的團扇，猶爲一般勞工所樂用，摺扇雖美觀，但「仁風扇揚」，究不如團扇來得實惠。</p>
<p>古人畫美女，常以扇入畫，可見扇與美人亦有不解之緣，以扇入詩者，昔人有「輕羅小扇撲流螢」之句，描繪甚美。致「秋扇見捐」，則屬美人遲暮了。</p>

<h3>扇子和女人</h3>
<p>— 東來</p>
<p>凡是讀過王爾德「少奶奶的扇子」和孔尙任「桃花扇」之類劇曲的朋友，當更加了然於扇子在女人身上所發生的影響和意義了。</p>
<p>其實遠在漢朝就有班婕妤的團扇詩，所謂「棄捐饒笥中，恩情中道絕」，早已成爲後世秋扇見捐的故實，晋時還有位王珉，因爲與嫂嫂的侍婢有私，常持白團扇作爲遮羞之用。其婢贈以白團扇歌云：「團扇復團扇，許持自障面。憔悴無復理，羞與郞相見。」扇子是除扇風之外，還有遮羞的妙用，難怪善于害羞的女人行動要以扇子自隨；而戲台上的生旦凈丑各色角兒特有各種不同的扇子，以助其裝模作樣了。</p>
<p>扇子在女人身上鬧的風流佳話最多，我鄕有一描金扇的故事，留傳衆口。前淸未年，一位闊官僚，娶了好幾房姨太太，其中有蘇州籍的，有揚州籍的，也有北京籍的。北京籍的姨太太，愛上了一個戲子，竟偸偸地把老爺最心愛的一把描金古玩摺扇，送給那個戲子，當作紀念品。後來不幸那把扇子在戲子手中被老爺香見了，歸向北京籍的姨太太索取，因爲這寳貝古玩一向是由她保管的，在這樣查逼之下，自然姦情畢露。老爺倒是開明的，連夜用轎子把姨太太送給那戲子，勒令兩人一同出境，自然連那柄描金扇也送給他們倆作爲定情物了。事後，這位慷慨的老爺，還慨然有作，記得末二句云：</p>
<p>「乘風送爾隨人去，願與描金扇共捐。」</p>
<p>這位老爺是善於自道的，把女人看作和扇子一樣的東西，隨便送送人，古有贈妾贈婢的怪風俗，這位老爺眞是「古道可風」</p>
<p>在一般人的眼光看來，扇子究不同於女人，扇子可贈，女人不可贈，因爲女人是有女人的人格的，她並不只是一種禮品啊！</p>
<p>但是一個人不能同時用兩把扇子扇風的，同樣，一個人也不應同時娶兩個妻子於一室，你多用了或多娶了一個，必有人少用了一個或者鰥居了終身，這是不</p>
<p>記得小時候，常戲用兩把扇子同時扇風取凉，祖母當即加以禁止，說這樣是扇不得的。問她是什麼理由？她又不肯說，後來聽別人吿訴我，這是一種迷信，說用兩把扇子向時扇風，死了以後要化生變爲蝴蝶的。</p>
<p>雖說荒唐，却荒唐得頗有點近於文藝的趣味了。</p>
<h3>談扇</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>古來詠扇的詩很多，秋風團扇，至今猶膾　人口。後來做作</p>
<h3>風蝶令</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>扇</p>
<p>熱令成需要，冷時便棄藏。障羞半面豈新妝？妙見飛機塲上躱新娘！</p>
<p>電足頭搖轉，風微手動忙，生同時代不同凉，誰念蠅驅蚊拍汗如漿！者相繼而起，錢塘詩人陳雲伯就是以「團扇詩」而出名的。但最初的詠扇，却是寄物寓感，文生於情，故其動人也深。到了後來，堆砌詞藻，言中無物，頂多不過是一種小擺設，給所謂「騷人雅客」們消遣消遣罷了。</p>
<p>團扇常有裝飾品如扇墜子，大概用玉雕刻各種人物玩好。王一文王有詠宋高宗一絕云：「千金空買玉孩兒」。玉孩兒就是扇墜子。據西湖志餘：「高宗嘗宴大臣，見張循王俊持扇，有玉孩兒，扇墜，上識是舊物，昔往四明誤墜於水者。問俊所從得，對曰：臣從淸河坊舖家買得之。詢舖家云，得之提籃人。復詢之乃從後潮門外陳宅廚娘處得之。詢之廚娘云：破黃花魚服中所得也。上大悅，舖家提籃人補校尉，廚娘封孺人」。此事實甚可笑。高宗意以爲舊物復還，大是佳兆，不覺把舖家，提籃人，廚娘之流，都當做收復失土，光復河山的功臣，封賞有加。事實上，除使這些販夫走卒們無端發了一次」洋財」以外，也就沒有什麼意義可言了。如果高宗當時能把岳武穆，韓世忠看得和提籃人，廚娘同樣重要，則舊物復還，豈僅止於玉孩兒而已。</p>
<p>秋風見捐，古今所悲。但鐘退谷有扇篋銘云：「藏女逸汝，女曰棄捐，吾鳥見夫僕僕懷袖者之能終其天年歲」。這樣說起來，「飛烏盡，良弓藏」，倒反是對良弓的恩賜了。其實，團扇至今，幾已絕跡，固已不待秋風之起。時下所通行的是摺扇，俗稱油紙扇，舒卷自如，携帶稱便。陸深春風草堂隨筆云：「今之摺扇，張東海以爲益於東夷，永樂間盛行中國。蓬窗續錄所載相同。然摺扇不始於明，案南宋時已有用者，東坡謂高麗白松扇，展之廣尺餘，合之止兩指，即「摺扇也」。豐坊云：「家有金章宗題摺扇詞」云：「幾股湘江龍骨瘦，巧樣翻新，疊作湘坡縐」、蓋宋金已有之，永樂時始盛行。</p>
<p>紹興周家橋爲摺扇主要產地之一，鄉人依此爲生者，十之八九。其製造的分工極細，酬資以分工的性質而有差，但大抵極廉。扇之優劣，略分數等，劣者一兩千，優者逾萬，戰前行銷海外，可獲巨金，戰後受物價影響，也日趨衰落了。摺扇面上，或畫或書，以爲點綴。「杭俗遺風」載女工有貼扇子云：「發往山東及北省之油紙扇，一面係彩畫人物，一面係剪就金字貼成。其貼字亦發女工，如舒蓮記張子元等扇莊，皆有發出不邊在八九月間始有。平日雖有，不甚多。價亦較廉，每貼一扇，僅錢數文而已」。可見當時曾盛行貼金扇，今則已不可復見了。</p>
<p>今日都市中電扇如雷，紙扇幾無用武之地，昔樊樊山曾詠輪船，火車，電訊，照今諸詩，繪聲繪色，頗爲精采，可惜沒有詠到電扇，大概那時還不十分流行吧。</p>

<h3>畫扇琑話</h3>
<p>— 胡亞光</p>
<p>畫扇一道，亦有訣也，未可忽焉。初學者恒視爲難事，蓋不詳訣　　。今試述一二，作學者之參考，作茶餘之談資。拉雜書之，望高明勿笑其淺陋，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>（一）去油：扇面上往往有油汚，作者不察，每畫至油汗處，即不易吃墨，殊不雅觀，舊法甚多，有用燈芯扎成一小筒，（愈堅實愈好）在未落墨之前，可輕輕揩擦，油汗盡去，揮洒自如矣。或用淸潔之頭髪　，或呢絨條扎一團，或用布包滑石粉，或烏賊粉，揩之亦效，後改用牙粉，較爲簡便，惟有時如不經心，油雖去，而粉質仍染於面上，亦將弄巧成拙，蓋墨中雜粉，色即變灰，不可不愼也。最簡便而隨時隨地皆可辦到者，即用草紙或毛鹿紙等，凡國產之有棉料性者，一擦即凈，無須用粉矣。</p>
<p>（二）撑平：油汚旣去，準備着筆，則扇板爲第一要件，最普通即係長方形者，有螺旋釘三枚，可任意縮放之一種，最爲適用，如嫌價昂，可自製取一方三夾板，依扇面大小，畫一扇形，或四週略放大些亦可，復依樣用銅絲鋸去四角，再購鋼製之文件夾三枚，愈緊愈佳，須擇其彈較强者，如是簡便之扇板即成矣。如用厚馬糞紙亦可自製，如有時匆遽間無扇板可覓，尙有最簡便之方法二，亦可採用，一即照扇面之摺痕，一一反摺之，亦能平坦，一即取電熨斗熨之亦可，此二者係於萬不得已時偶一用之，非盡善也。</p>
<p>（三）靠手：夏日作畫，手腕間必有汗液，落筆時，最好在扇面右方勢一薄巾，以資靠手，則自左而右，自右而左，即無汗污之弊矣。</p>
<p>（四）塗改：如偶有筆誤，或款字題錯，切不可亂塗亂揩，致汚損扇面，無法補救，有一妙法，即取上等香烟灰（雪茄灰尤妙）用凈筆蘸之，塗少許於誤筆處，再蘸淸水輕輕流之，即去，旣無痕跡，復極簡便，但不可用勢過重，最好勿損面之礬質，否則　質擦去，用墨用色，均有痕跡，且有損扇面也。</p>
<p>（五）圖章：圖章或有時倒蓋，或扇面上沾有印泥，可用軟質白橡皮輕輕揩擦之，自去。又蓋好印章，扇而摺疊時，手指磨擦，容易糢糊，可用朱砂粉調明　末拌勻塗拭之，則色澤既鮮明美觀，而又不易揩糊也。</p>
<p>（六）漏　：凡作雨景山水，或大筆潑墨花卉等，每於酣暢淋漓，意興甚高之時，不顧一切，取快一時，不知等筆墨乾透後，始發現已力透紙背，蓋已滲過反面矣，試問至此時將如何收拾，反面如尙未書寫者，則人將雅不願書寫矣。如已書寫好者，則豈非汚及他人之書法耶？使人難堪，自己亦弄得啼笑皆非矣，此即所謂須大胆落筆，細心收拾是耳。凡於落筆後，見有大量之墨水停積於扇面摺縫時，即速取乾筆滲之，則可保無患，蓋汚及反面者，往往因吸水時間過久，面上礬質已浸去，則扇面已經漏蘇，毫無保陣，則水份自然滲及反面矣。此點亦係難免之事，初學者不可不注意及之。</p>
<p>（七）章法：扇面之章法，花卉等與其他尺頁無異，惟山水及有補景之人物走歡飛禽等，即須審愼一番，蓋扇面係半圓形，上端寬，下端狹者，作山水或補景，如依其半圓形，自左而右，逐部添繪，則至全面畫成，不知不覺中，已鑄成大錯，蓋其遠山也，近坡也，水平綫也，均成弧形矣，大鬧笑話，初學往往易犯此病。總之，未畫之先，勿視爲扇面，須視爲尺頁，扇面不過猶尺頁剪裁成扇形而已，須大體着筆，則萬無一失，揮寫自如矣。而題款則不然，不可視爲尺頁之平寫直寫也，如直題，則須依摺疊處上大下小之斜度而寫，方爲美觀，如橫題，則須依其邊緣之弧形而寫，方爲美觀合式也，此雖小節，關係殊巨也。</p>
<h3>破扇詞</h3>
<p>— 周崑</p>
<p>暑氣緜緜，炎光赫赫，汗流俠背，氣　沈結，是日何貴，茲扇第一，匠者呈巧，所重惟紙，採竹成　，畫象造儀，動角揚徵，淸風逐暑，停神靜思，且以永日。一旦扇破，隔暑有風，遏陽無力，不禁感慨。余嘗讀許倪咏破扇詩日：「蔽日無全影，搖風有半凉，不比彭巧笑，猶是動衣香。」馬軾破扇詞，「月中誰畫乘鶯女，紫竹銀絲挾素羅，未到秋來光破碎，從前應是受風多。」讀罷，喟然而嘆。軛近民　湯火，甚於煎沙爍石，無可逃避，其誰奉簡書，就所握，舒徐搖曳，在在風生，左顧左冷然，有盼右冷然，捐煩即夷如在冰室，則必咸賞心謝曰：焦土之民，少蘇憔悴，皆所賜也！</p>

<h3>談集扇</h3>
<p>— 張肖滄</p>
<p>集扇之應注重畫與書，人盡知之，餘如手拓金石文字，磚文，佛像之類，亦別有佳趣。</p>
<p>扇骨之美，亦爲集扇者所兼愛，如水磨竹，刻竹，棕竹，梅竹，湘妃，波羅漆，烏木，檀香，平竹，玳瑁，象牙鷄翹，及各種漆骨，不一而足，惟以舊者爲貴。江南人士，並不重視扇骨下端之扇托，故都榮寳齋，淸閟閣諸家，每將扇骨託專製扇托者，（名陳子和，爲故都第一名手）用玳瑁等品製成鼠托，則堅固不易損壞，上海扇莊，近更將扇面扇骨粗製濫造，誰復考究扇托一事，言之可慨。</p>
<p>扇面昔重泥金，愚所藏明代扇頁，赤金奪目，燦爛可愛，歷年所收扇面册頁，什九皆以得泥金舊扇爲上。在昔尙有貨品扇面可得，扇面內層印有「淅江巡撫某某恭製」字樣，其質自非今之普通扇面可及。</p>
<p>書晝家對於在扇骨上寫字或畫，多非素習，視爲長途，則以扇骨略有高低，非紙張之可舒展平舖隨意加以書畫者。故都某刻竹家，乃將名家之書畫，先由攝影製飯，再在製版之上，塗以一種藥水，可從藥水之變化作用，複印到扇骨之上，與原書畫絕不走樣。再從事奏刀，比書畫家在扇骨上寥寥數筆率爾爲之之者，更多精彩，此亦刻竹家所應取法者也。</p>

<h3>第卅七次文藝茶話會講演　中國畫寫生方法</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華講　若渠記錄</p>
<p>繪畫本來是造形藝術，所以必須取法於自然，要取法於自然，就非寫生不可；所以無論中西畫法，雖各有它不同的特點，但是以寫生為出發點，却是中外一律的。中國畫在唐宋時代，本都是寫生的，畫史所載，班班可考。吳道子要盡嘉陵江山水，便乘船到嘉陵江去遊歷。王維住在賴川，就晝賴川山水。荊浩關同畫北方山水，董源巨然畫江南山水，米芾畫南徐山水，馬逮夏圭畫浙東山水。畫馬的以天閑十萬匹為師，畫牛的能畫牛睛中所映牧童的景象；晝花的在階前離下，描寫迎風垂露，含苞綻蕊的形狀；畫人物的不但盡人的形狀，而且要傳人的精神和性情。</p>
<p>中國畫寫生的風氣，到了元代，漸漸起了變化，像黃子久雖也畫宮春山，王蒙也畫苕　山，但是因為文人畫的發展，畫家多在筆情墨趣，超逸神韻上用工夫，便忽略了寫生的基本工作。同時因為世上的畫一天多其一天，畫家依畫作畫較依自然作畫容易得多？好逸惡勞，人之恒情，於是臨摹古畫，便盛行於畫界，而實地寫生，就漸漸無人過問。這種風氣到了明淸兩代，極為流行，畫家只知有古人，不知有自然。臨華的風氣愈盛，而畫道愈衰，晝都成了一種陳陳相因，千篇一律，亳無生氣的複製品。沒有寫生，沒有創作，近人有作淸代三百年一來無畫論的，淸代並不是無畫，是沒有眞實創作有生命的晝，而所有的畫百分之九十九，都是一「弟子臨先生」，或先生臨古人的。</p>
<p>經過明淸五六百年的長時間，畫家只研究臨摹的方法，沒有人肯學習寫生的方法，到了現在寫生的方法早已失傳。所以我們要想研究中國畫寫生的方法，苦於無從着手，所幸近代西洋畫輸人，我們在初學的時候，可以先學西畫寫生方法作為一種基礎，然後再進而為中國畫的寫生。因為西畫和中畫，那寫生的方法根本不同，西畫的方法實較國畫的方法為容易，所以無妨先借用一下。</p>
<p>西畫寫生要有一定的立足點，畫家的視點和地平綫要有一定的高低，畫家對於自然物，要有一定的距離，不能左顧右盼，也不能前瞻後移。而且要受時間和光綫的限制，早量九點鐘西畫的景物，也只能畫到十點鐘，到了過午，太陽光綫完全變了，就須全嬉另晝了。因此西畫不是到野外去實地寫生，就須在人造光綫的畫室裏才能着手。所以說西晝是固定的分析的，受援視學嚴格限制的，自然物映於眼中，反映一在盡面上的一種具體的一時的現象。把這種方法學會了以後，然後再應用在中國畫的寫生上，因為中國畫不受時間的限制不受光綫的約束，不受透視學的羈絆畫家更沒有固定的立足點，畫面上也不一定有地平綫。臂如要畫黃山，畫家就從山下走到山上，從山約走到山後，從山左走到山右，把黃山的全體形狀，都融會貫通在胸中，略去它的繁瑣，採取它的精華，然後回到家裏，把心中的印象表現在書面上。所以一幅畫上（例如我畫的黃山大觀）可以從天門坎晝到天都運花，從文殊院可以畫到獅子林，這是國畫寫生的特長，而是西實所束手無策的。所以國畫寫生是全體的，永久的，綜合的印象。說是晝的黃山吧，却不是一景一木，一山一石像照相一樣那麼像眞的黃山。說不是黃山吧，却天都蓮花，文殊，獅林，凡到過黃山的一望而知，這種若即若離，不即不離，擷精取神的辦法，就是國畫的特長，也就是藝術的之所以為藝備。不過這種方法，不是一朝一夕所能成功的，行萬里路，看盡天下名山大川，積二三十年技法的修練，再參和上古人的筆墨方法，澤以讀萬卷書的書卷氣，才有成功的希望。本人雖有志於比顧所得頗淺本祈方家不吝指敎為辛。</p>

<h3>記「天下太平」殘瓦</h3>
<p>— 鍾公佩</p>
<p>瓦之制作，起源甚早，自宮室之營造勃興，則瓦之需要及發明乃應時產生。及後，因文化衍進，於日用之外，更有美觀怡目之要求，於是文飾之制興起。於瓦上施以古拙簡樸之花紋，圖案，或文牢以增飾之。雖代有製作，厥推秦漢為最盛，亦以　漢為最精。吾人試一觀秦漢瓦當造字之渾樸蒼勁，圖範之典雅古拙，癖愛之心，不禁油然而生。又何怪其名振古今，殘磚斷瓦，俱為古董家視若拱璧耶？</p>
<p>瓦當之見於著錄，當推宋王關之所著「　水燕談綠」為最早，（係記載宋元　六年寶鷄縣民權氏濬池得秦武公羽陽宮瓦事，是為瓦當出土令人注意之始。）數百年來，秘藏日出，昔日塵沒於荒榛塵土間者，今乃別為金石之一格，而入於藝術考古之林。</p>
<p>本年七月七日上午，余至中山公園散步，於國立藝專後首山麓瓦礫間，發見殘破瓦當數方，乃携歸剔理。明日復往檢取，於該處附近積土中，又覓得數方，物雖殘破，而其　魄式樣頗多古意，其中當以「天下太平』瓦最為別緻，（見圖）特加考繹，諒亦為治是學者所樂間。</p>
<p>細察是瓦，土質細膩，色微現靑白，火氣盡脫，當係入土年久所致，而其形略作　圓，乃俗稱飛簷瓦，亦即漢時所稱半瓦者是。是瓦形制，有大小兩種：大者縱長約cm12日，橫長約cm18，厚約cm2，小者縱長約cm10，橫長約cm17，厚約cm1。瓦上正中範刻一形似辟邪之怪首，猙獰可怖，古拙而頗且神態，與戰前南京出土之梁同泰寺瓦當之範刻極相酷似。其下作三條波浪形之曲綫，由瓦之一端伸長至他端，首旁左右兩角，分刻『天下太平」楷書四字，文頗渾機，或天下二字在左；或太平二字在左，而其字亦大小不一，諒係數範所出，又從是瓦之文字及土質以與雷峯塔還　相較頗多相似之處·當係五代之物。經勘其地，適當照膽聶之後，（今　專　　膽臺舊址，）即宋　所謂瑪瑙坡故址，復據「湖山便覽」卷二所載：「瑪瑙寶勝防火牆，晋開疆三氣吳越錢氏　，宋在〕中祥符間僧習圓重修，……；紹興閱，以毬延祥觀徒葛嶺，明以其址建照贈轟」。則可知該處原係塲瑙寶勝院遺址。再查吳越自武肅王末年改用唐朔，及唐亡晋石敬塘竊國後所遺石刻等紀年，常不書國號，僅記年月，蓋其時已　中原正朔，而國號則諱言之。『天下太平』瓦爲　　寶勝院遺物，極屬可能，文言『天下太平』，實恐有　飾　代之意。</p>
<p>其他殘瓦多種，亦均範刻雅緻，或作卷雲狀，或作水波狀，或作雙捲四出狀，種種不一，其中要以葵花浮雕為最出色，當亦同時之物。至其處附近尙遺有淸代聖因寺行宮三色（黃·綠·黑）琉璃瓦及明淸之問所遺瓦當甚多，容當另文介紹，茲不贅述。（七月記於西湖文瀾關）</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　379</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>『您呵…」耀羣略一沉吟；「您知道咱們從關裏來，走這一趣，好不容易；誰知道裏又變了新鮮樣兒了；沒的十程走了九程半，赶到了老家，再出花樣，有些不合算！…這麽辦…』。</p>
<p>「好，您哪，…佟招待聽明白了　羣的意向，這才把縐起一雙粗眉舒展開了：「到底您有學問的好。您怎麽說，我　麽辦」。</p>
<p>「急這就差兩位老手「趙子」，先走一程，一面知會咱們沿路暗崗警備，一面察看路上可乾凈；乾凈的話，可以一直放到老寨；沿路知會站上備馬；萬一路上不怎麽乾凈，呌他們派一人儘快往回拆，咱們也好準備。咱們這兒仍奮照您打算的，準十二點動身。…（趙子即探子，保鐘局斥候名稱，匪類同樣工作，稱為盤子。</p>
<p>「真行，您哪！」佟招待一舉手，翹起了大姆指：「「小心沒有錯』，這就叫人佩服！…」</p>
<p>「你知道」，躍羣接着說：『我同虎弟，都不是怕事的。不過，這回有些特別，事情太要緊，不能不把穩些，……况且，也不願給老寨闖禍……」（三七〇）</p>
<p>夜午十二點，一切佈置妥當，二人登車就道。車行不到十分鐘，已經上了公路，於是增加速度，行駛如飛。沿這公路，老寨本來佈置下許多暗崗和五個小站，每站路住不同，然而都通老寨。第一二三及第五站，路程較遠，也最崎嶇難行。第四站程度最短，道路也最平坦。惟其易走，老寨人來人往，除了急事之外，多半不用；因恐惹人注意。</p>
<p>躍羣這回旅行，却是取的穩扎穩打方針；所以打算取道第四站；一則可以節省些時間；再者，也有很多日子，不曾揭　執轡，把人養息得嬌嫩了。而且老寨牲口馬匹，隻隻神駿悍龍，不易駕馭，行程如若過分峙嶇，未免危險。可是，方針雖然定了，也要看那兩個先行的　子手，沿路踩探的動靜如何，才能決定。</p>
<p>車子駛到第一小站，沿路所經過幾個暗崗，都有「平安」信號　上，雖站不遠，就有哨綫騎着馬迎了上來，看見車燈放出的暗號，便兜轉馬頭，跟在車子身旁，遞過消息，知道那先行兩個趙子手，辦事精明；一到站，就吩咐替　虎二人備罵同候，又差了一名小站下手，走第一站路綫，沿路先驅而去；吩咐之後，去又往第二站去踩探。耀羣聽了，見趟子手如此周到極其滿意，便令車子往第二站地去。</p>

<h3>Government Improves Foreign Exchange Control, Establishes Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, Allows Export Income and Overseas Remittances to be Settled at Market Prices, Foreign Currency and Gold Still Permitted to Circulate and Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 16th] The "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" proposed by President Zhang were passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th. This measure is divided into two major parts, with important contents as follows: A. The Executive Yuan shall revise the interim measures for import-export trade according to the following principles, which will be implemented immediately: (1) Foreign exchange earned from exports and other remittances from abroad shall be allowed to be sold and settled at market prices, and designated banks shall be specified. (2) The import of goods shall temporarily continue to adopt the import license system. The foreign exchange required shall be provided by the Central Bank at the official price for some daily necessities, and the rest shall be allowed to be purchased from designated banks at market prices with a certificate. The list of goods and types that should be supplied with official-priced foreign exchange shall be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Import-Export Control Committee at any time. As an incidental measure, the international trade organization, which previously had both export and import sections, will now be replaced by a temporary Import-Export Management Committee under the Executive Yuan. B. The Executive Yuan shall strictly manage foreign exchange according to the following principles: (1) Strictly stipulate the measures for designated banks to buy and sell foreign exchange at market prices. (2) Strictly stipulate the qualifications of designated banks and reduce the number of designated banks to facilitate investigation. (3) Supervise the operation of overseas Chinese remittances. (4) Establish a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to be responsible for regulating the supply and demand of import-export trade and other legal foreign exchange transactions in order to balance foreign exchange market prices, with three incidental measures: (1) Strictly review institutions and personnel stationed abroad. (2) Crack down on gold speculation. (3) Prohibit the circulation of foreign currency.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" passed by the State Council meeting include the following key points in the attached "Measures to Prohibit the Circulation of Foreign Currency": Chinese and foreign people entering the country may carry foreign currency, up to US$100 or the equivalent in other currencies per person. Those exceeding this amount must voluntarily declare and register with the customs, and exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its entrusted exchange on the date of entry. Those who conceal their foreign currency will have it confiscated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] In order to eradicate the use of foreign exchange for private overseas travel and transactions related to industries that are not import-export in nature, the Executive Yuan has drafted control measures and designated responsible agencies, roughly as follows: (1) Foreign exchange applications from government agencies will be handled by the Foreign Exchange Review Committee. (2) Foreign exchange applications required for approved imports will be handled by the Import-Export Control Committee. (3) Foreign exchange applications from students approved by the Ministry of Education will be handled by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Returns to Shanghai to Talk, New Foreign Exchange Management Measures to be Announced Today, Hoping to Stimulate Exports and Reverse the Outflow of Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter immediately visited him at his residence to inquire about the government's upcoming changes to the foreign exchange management measures. Mr. Zhang received the reporter despite his illness and made the following remarks: "The State Council has already approved the new foreign exchange management measures in principle. The detailed implementation measures will be drafted separately by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan convened a review committee at around 5:00 p.m. on the 15th to make a decision. The complete detailed measures will be officially announced at the Central Bank at around 4:00 p.m. today."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang then stated: "The government, in view of the large difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market rate in the past, which led to the inability to absorb overseas remittances and the failure to promote exports, and the fact that most of the materials imported at the official foreign exchange rate were sold at the black market foreign exchange rate, had no choice but to seek alternative improvement measures in this state, in order to make exports more active, allow overseas remittances to flow back, and at the same time, balance the supply and demand of foreign exchange."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The revised measures for foreign exchange control and import-export trade will be announced simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai on the 17th. According to government sources, the purpose of this measure is to adjust the management of foreign exchange in order to revitalize import-export trade. The measure is extremely comprehensive and takes all aspects into consideration. After being passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the morning of the 16th further studied it in detail. It is believed that its purpose will definitely be achieved after implementation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] On the 16th, an economic authority commented on the "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" drafted by Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, believing that this measure would have a positive impact on the current economic situation. The current control policy has lost its effect and has many drawbacks. If the new measures are implemented, import-export trade can be greatly revitalized, production can also be increased, and overseas remittances can no longer be avoided. In addition, considerable expenses of foreigners in China, such as charity, military, and diplomatic expenses, can also be handled through designated banks. Another positive effect is that all smuggling can be eliminated. It was heard that some people advocated a full opening, but this matter would have too great an impact and too much risk. This measure is better, with two steps to proceed more steadily.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Pingjin Branch to Add Issuance Section</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] In order to ensure the smooth circulation of finance in North China, the Central Bank has decided to strengthen its Beiping branch and add an issuance section to the branch. Li Guanghui has been appointed as the director, and it will be formally established within the month. According to the person in charge, the section will supervise issuance to ensure smooth circulation and assist in treasury duties.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange "Market Price" to be Slightly Lower Than Black Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The authorities are still considering the foreign exchange "market price," which is said to be slightly lower than the black market price and will be decided within days. The official foreign exchange rate remains unchanged at 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fighting Tigers and Flies Together, Pingjinji Military and Political Supervision Group, Hebei Supervisory Office in Preparation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] The Pingjinji Military Discipline and Officialdom Supervision Group, ordered by Chairman Chiang's hand-letter to the Hebei Supervisory Office of the Control Yuan, is about to be established. The Supervisory Office has now sent letters to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, Baoding Pacification Headquarters, and the Pingjinji Provisional Consultative Council, requesting them to send personnel to participate. The group will be composed of seven members, with a monthly budget of 40 million, and a working period of six months. Because it has the power to arrest and inspect troops, the Executive Headquarters and Pacification Headquarters will be represented by senior officials second only to the director, and the Provisional Consultative Council will be represented by the speaker or deputy speaker. The head of the group is Li Sicong, the Hebei Supervisor, and report boxes will be set up in Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding. Someone will be sent to inspect various places. The person in charge of the group told reporters that this time they will fight tigers and flies together.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth are Absolutely Not Allowed to be Imported, Ministry of Economic Affairs Spokesperson Solemnly Denies Rumors, Qingdao Opens Control of Yarn and Cloth and Permits Export</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Committee for Guidance on Trade with Japan has decided that, among the goods permitted to be imported from Japan, except for rayon, which is currently urgently needed in China, the rest are transportation and industrial equipment that are conducive to China's construction. Cotton yarn and cloth are absolutely not included in the list of permitted imports. The news reported by a certain newspaper in Shanghai a few days ago that a large amount of cotton yarn would be imported from Japan is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] The Qingdao Municipal Government previously issued an order to control the export of yarn, cloth, and raw oil due to the shortage of grain in Qingdao, and stipulated that all merchants exporting yarn, cloth, and raw oil must pledge to transport back the equivalent value of food in order to stabilize grain prices, but this has greatly affected the yarn, cloth, and raw oil market. Therefore, merchants have requested that the control measures be abolished. The municipal government has now decided to first open up the export of yarn and cloth, and the previously established method of exchanging yarn and cloth exports for food has been temporarily suspended, while the export of raw oil continues to be controlled.</p>

<h3>Full Text of US Note to Soviet Union Refusing to First Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty Proposals at Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] Regarding the preliminary battle for the Japanese peace treaty, the United States reiterated the reasons for its original proposal when signing the Soviet Union's counter-proposal. The US proposal is to convene an eleven-nation conference as soon as possible to draft the Japanese peace treaty and obtain the opinions of various countries at the conference. The note on this matter was delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires here on Wednesday and was released by the State Department today. According to the Soviet Union's response to the US original proposal: The Soviet government believes that the issue of convening a conference to draft the Japanese peace treaty must first be reviewed temporarily by the Foreign Ministers Conference composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The US government believes that the discussions on the Far East peace issue at the Potsdam Conference do not require expanding the agreement stipulated in the Potsdam Treaty for the Foreign Ministers Conference, so that the issue of resolving the Japanese peace must be resolved at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The establishment of the Foreign Ministers Conference, although based on preparing the Japanese peace treaty, the US government does not believe that this issue must be submitted to the Foreign Ministers Conference, for the following reasons: There are no clauses in the Cairo Declaration, Yalta Conference, or Potsdam Declaration on Japan that stipulate that the Foreign Ministers Conference has the right to resolve the Japanese peace. In December 1945, the four governments attending the Foreign Ministers Conference formed a commission in Moscow in order to formulate various policies, principles, and standards, so that the obligations to comply with these policies and fulfill the conditions of surrender could be fulfilled. The US government believes that this action has recognized that these countries have a major interest in the policy issues and peace agreements after Japan's surrender. Therefore, for the benefit of other countries in the Pacific, the governments of the countries attending the Foreign Ministers Conference must recognize that the organization of the current conference considering this agreement should be larger than the Foreign Ministers Conference. For this reason, the US government believes that neither the Foreign Ministers Conference established in Potsdam nor the Foreign Ministers Conference composed of the four powers pointed out by the Soviet government is an appropriate body to consider the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>The note that the US government submitted to the other ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission on July 11 is also based on this opinion. In this note, the United States is only seeking the opinions of each country and cannot act unilaterally. Although the US government does not believe that the issue of the Japanese peace treaty should be discussed by the Foreign Ministers Conference for the above reasons, it will still forward the Soviet government's opinions to the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and the countries attending the Foreign Ministers Conference are already included.</p>
<p>The US government is willing to point out that nine members of the Far Eastern Commission have already responded to the suggestions made by the US government on July 11, expressing their agreement to convene an eleven-nation Japanese peace treaty conference, which can freely decide its own procedures.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Soviet government will also express its willingness to participate in the conference to consider the Japanese peace treaty, which should be held in the near future and attended by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Diplomatic officials stated on the 16th that the United States is now preparing to invite the other nine countries of the Far Eastern Commission to begin work on the Japanese peace treaty, even if there are no Soviet representatives participating. Diplomatic officials agree that the peace conference will be convened in Washington around September 10, as this is before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (to be convened in New York).</p>
<h3>Wei Envoy Returns to Beijing from Guangzhou, to Go to Korea for Inspection Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Wei Demai and his party returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou at 5:30 p.m. on the 16th. It is heard that their work in Guangzhou was not as ideal as expected, but they were quite satisfied with their trip to Taiwan and Shanghai. It is learned that the delegation will leave China on the 24th and fly to Korea via Tokyo. Before leaving, in addition to visiting Chairman Chiang to say goodbye, they plan to hold a cocktail party next weekend to entertain the heads of our government and people from all walks of life as a farewell.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] On the morning of the 16th, Special Envoy Wei met with the leaders of the Youth Party here, Chi Zaiqing, Zhongda Professor Liu Yaosang, Zhang Daowu, Liu Weisen, Li Yiru, Feng Diancheng, and others at the US Consulate to inquire about various issues investigated by the delegation and the situation in the cultural circles here. The content of the conversation was very extensive. Wei and his party boarded the plane and left Guangzhou for Beijing in heavy rain at 2:00 p.m. after reviewing the honor guard.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] When Special Envoy Wei met with Lin Zhengxuan, the leader of the Social Democratic Party here, yesterday, he inquired about his opinions on the current political and economic problems in China. Lin replied that China is confident that it has the ability to solve its current difficulties, but if it receives rapid assistance from the United States, the current difficulties can be overcome quickly. The Communist Party should bear most of the responsibility for the current difficulties. Wei expressed great sympathy for this opinion. Wei also said that the United States is not prepared to support any one party in China, but is prepared to help China in a friendly manner. Wei also said that China is currently in a very favorable environment for self-reliance, because no country is currently interfering in China's internal affairs. When Wei met with He Jiping, the chairman of the city's Chamber of Commerce, the conversation focused on economic issues, inquiring about the general equipment and production of factories in South China, and paying close attention to the traffic situation on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. He mentioned that Guangdong had economic relations with foreign countries very early. If American businessmen can invest and build in Guangdong, the people of Guangdong will have great development based on past experience. When Wei met with Wu Dingxin, the president of Minda University, and other members of the education community, he inquired whether the government interfered in the advancement and retreat of school staff and students, and the causes of this year's student unrest. Wu and others replied that the government had never interfered in the advancement and retreat of staff and students, and the main reason for the student unrest was the instigation of the Chinese Communist Party, and cited facts to prove it.</p>

<h3>Rumor Wei Demai will Recommend Giving Me Conditional Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City News] Sources close to Special Envoy Wei Demai claimed that one of Wei's main tasks was to make a report after doubly estimating the threat of the Communist Army to China and its possible harm to American Far East policy. According to reliable sources speaking to a United Press reporter, Wei and his advisors will be preparing a report in Nanjing next Monday, reviewing the data on the overall US policy toward the world, rather than limiting it to China's needs.</p>
<p>Several people in the diplomatic community in China who have met with Wei and Wei's subordinates have a common feeling that the special envoy will recommend to the United States that "closely monitored aid" be given to the National Government, but so far, in addition to the special envoy's advisors, the data Wei has obtained proves that the Chinese Communist Party is a major problem for American policy. He would rather take the National Government as the lesser evil, and he is willing to recommend aid to Chairman Chiang, but he will pay more attention to the use of aid and promote the improvement of the National Government, rather than witness the formation of another Soviet satellite.

<h3>Chairman Zhang's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday, concluded)</p>
<p>Allowance of 200,000 for Public School Employees in Peiping and Tientsin</p>
<p>Secondly, the method of allocating and selling goods to public school employees in Peiping and Shanghai has proven effective and should be maintained. Before the implementation of allocating and selling goods in Peiping and Tientsin, public school employees in these two cities will each receive an allowance of 200,000 yuan per month based on the average price difference of allocated goods in Peiping and Shanghai for June and July of this year. Due to these two measures, the state treasury's monthly burden will increase by over 20 billion yuan. Combined with the increase in basic amounts for the aforementioned regions, the total monthly increase in expenditure will be 155.58 billion yuan. According to the above methods, although the increase in treatment after this adjustment of civil servants is slightly less than that of the adjustment in May of this year, it achieves the goal of consistent treatment for civil servants. The state treasury's burden is greater than any previous adjustment, and the long-standing inequality between civil and military personnel treatment has been eliminated, which is its greatest feature. Although the treatment of civil and military personnel has been equalized, there are still significant disparities in treatment among civil servants. The treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises is generally much better than that of ordinary civil servants, which is very unfair. The former Supreme National Defense Council also considered the special circumstances of state-owned enterprises and stipulated in the measures for the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprise organs that "the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprise organs may be determined independently based on their usual practices, but the total amount of their income shall not be less than 20% of the income of civil servants of equivalent rank, nor shall it be higher than 110%." Since the promulgation of these measures, many state-owned enterprises have strictly complied with the regulations, ensuring that their personnel's treatment does not exceed 110% of that of civil servants. However, the actual income of some state-owned enterprise personnel is several times higher than that of civil servants of equivalent rank. Although the government has repeatedly instructed these state-owned enterprises to comply with the above regulations and reduce their personnel's treatment, the accumulated inertia is difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>Treatment of Employees in State-Owned Enterprises to be Reduced</p>
<p>During this adjustment of civil and military personnel treatment, when making them consistent, the government decided to supervise and implement the regulations of the former Supreme National Defense Council regarding the excessive treatment of state-owned enterprise personnel beyond the scope stipulated by the National Defense Council, ensuring that the inequality in treatment among civil servants and the violation of government regulations no longer exist. This is the second feature of this treatment adjustment.</p>
<p>Strictly Address Troop Shortages, Military Expenses to be Used for Public Purposes</p>
<p>After this adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel and personnel in state-owned enterprises, I have two sincere hopes: First, since the treatment of military personnel is now consistent with that of civil servants, the amount increased for each person is very significant, and the state treasury's burden is even heavier. I sincerely hope that the military leaders in charge will strictly order their subordinates to be strict about troop shortages and military expenditures. In addition to strictly implementing the accounting and auditing systems, the government will also improve the inspection methods to ensure that military expenditures are used for public purposes and to eliminate waste. I am confident that all military leaders and troops will understand this intention and conscientiously comply. Second, the basic amount of the increase in treatment for civil servants this time is 100,000 yuan, which is difficult to keep up with the upper limit of prices. The government is deeply concerned about the hardships of civil servants' lives. However, at this time of financial deficit, we must consider the state treasury's burden. I hope that our civil servants will uphold their consistent spirit of loyalty to the country and share the difficulties of the times. This is what I hope for.</p>
<h3>Members of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan Appointed; Outline of Regulations for the Business Delegation Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The members of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan have been officially appointed. The list is as follows: Chairman: Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Yi Jiling. Members: Deputy Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, Zhu Xie; Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation, Jin Shixuan; Assistant Officer of the East Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Jiecai; Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission, Wu Zhaohong; Head of the Third Group of the National Economic Council, Chen Zongjing; Manager of the Trade Department of the Central Trust of China, He Molin.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The second meeting of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan was held on the morning of the 16th, chaired by Yang Shuren. The "Outline of Regulations for the Implementation of the Organizational Measures for the Business Delegation to Japan" was approved. Once this outline is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation, the committee will reconvene to discuss the preparations for the business delegation. The outline consists of five points: (1) The number of delegates is still set at 20, namely 13 from private industrial and commercial enterprises, 5 from public enterprises, and 2 from overseas Chinese businesses. (2) The selection criteria stipulate that candidates must not only have rich experience and ability in trade with Japan, but also have sufficient funds. (3) The selection procedure for public enterprise candidates will be jointly designated by the various units of the enterprise. The candidates for private enterprises will be first discussed and determined by the Federation of Commerce and the Industrial Association, and then recommended separately by the local branches of the above two units. (4) The types of import and export goods must first be checked against the trade measures set by the Far Eastern Commission, but may be adjusted independently by our country when necessary. (5) Trade settlement is still determined to adopt a ledger settlement system, which in nature is equivalent to an import-export linkage system.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Japanese Goods is Worrying: Shui Xiangyun Talks About Opening Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shui Xiangyun said: "After trade with Japan is opened, the most worrying thing is the rampant smuggling. Our country currently has import controls, which have proven to be ineffective in preventing smuggling. This is the case with American goods, and even more so with Japanese goods. In the past, American goods were expensive, and only a few people enjoyed them. The sales were mainly in the cities. However, Japanese goods are cheaper and will inevitably penetrate the countryside. Therefore, the smuggling of Japanese goods is almost inevitable. The route will probably be first to Taiwan, then to Hong Kong as a base, and then northwards from South China. Japan's manufacturing of cosmetics and exquisite goods is superior to even the United States in some areas. Our country learned the technology of the rubber industry from Japan. How can we compete with them today? In other industries such as the manufacturing and chemical industries, our country is not Japan's enemy. If smuggling cannot be strictly prohibited, then national industries will be threatened, and unemployment will inevitably increase." Shui also said that when he went to Peiping to petition, a certain important official said that there were unavoidable difficulties in opening trade with Japan, "One is due to the general trend in the international community, and we cannot oppose it alone. The second is that MacArthur ordered the opening of private trade with Japan based on the Potsdam Agreement before the Far Eastern Commission met to discuss it, so that the Far Eastern Commission could no longer overturn MacArthur's decision."</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case of the US Soldier Throwing People into the Water in Beijing; Father of the Deceased Appears in Court to Describe the Tragedy; More Witnesses Need to be Summoned and the Hearing Will Resume on the 18th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Zhonghe Bridge tragedy continued to be heard today.

Since there are still many witnesses who need to be summoned, it was decided to resume the hearing on the morning of the 18th.</p>
<p>Wang Guohua, the father of Wang Shouben, who is over forty years old, could not contain his grief when he appeared in court to describe the circumstances of his son's death. According to reports, his son did not know how to swim and never bathed or fished by the river. It was definitely not an accidental fall into the water. After answering the questions, he intended to continue making statements regarding the matter of consolation. The court considered this point to be beyond the scope of the court's trial, so it opened a secret court to discuss it and decided that the prosecutor and the defense counsel should first explain this situation to Wang outside the court. Afterwards, Wang re-entered the court and said in a sad tone: "The United States is the strongest and most powerful country in the world. My young son was now thrown into the water for no reason. I am very sad in my heart. My family of three rooms has only this one son. Now that this accident has happened, who will I rely on for life in the future? The family members of the deceased are in difficulty, and I hope that they can be taken care of." After speaking, he bowed to the entire audience and said in an excited tone: "Thank you for your help."</p>
<p>As for Yin Ruisheng, who witnessed Wang Shouben and others being pushed into the water at that time, he made a living by fishing. He happened to be there when the incident happened. When he appeared in court, he was wearing a short shirt and trousers and incomplete shoes and socks. He looked completely like a simple farmer, and his speech was simple and responsible. According to reports, he witnessed Wang Shouben and Ge Fatian being pushed into the water one after another. The clothing of the pushers was the same as the judges in the court (US military uniform). Wang Shouben was still struggling with his hands after being pushed down. Before long, another person was pushed into the water. Another Chinese on the bridge ran away and was spared. There were three Americans on the scene at that time, and another one was sitting in a jeep. The moonlight was bright that night, so there was no possibility of misidentification. In order to be accurate, the prosecutor and others also presented maps and photos to let him point out the location of the incident, and Yin answered truthfully one by one.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Foreign Exchange Control is Liberated</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's proposed revision of foreign exchange regulations and import-export trade management measures was approved by the State Council on the 15th. The main points are: (1) Opening up foreign exchange. (2) Managing import and export trade. This is the most significant reform in our country's foreign trade since November 4, 1935, and it is also what the majority of people at home and abroad have keenly hoped for.</p>
<p>Because the implementation of the legal tender policy and the determination of the foreign exchange rate both started on that day. By March 14, 1938, the "Measures for Applying for Approval to Purchase Foreign Exchange" were announced. In the winter of 1941, the U.S. dollar rate was fixed at 20 yuan. In January 1944, the subsidy for overseas remittances and missionary U.S. dollars was changed to 100 percent. In July 1945, the overseas remittance subsidy was changed back to 480 yuan, totaling 500 yuan, equivalent to one U.S. dollar. By February 25, 1946, the foreign exchange market was opened, setting the U.S. dollar rate at 2,020 yuan. On August 19, it was reset to 3,350 yuan. On February 16 of this year, it was further set at 12,000 yuan. However, these figures are just official rates. Those with funds are unwilling to settle and sell at these rates, and those applying for foreign exchange find it even more difficult to settle and purchase at these rates. Because the black market rate is too far from the official rate, a stalemate has formed, making it impossible for import and export businesses to operate. Foreign businessmen are especially burdened, causing large amounts of overseas remittances to be diverted, and smuggling is rampant, becoming an almost open secret.</p>
<p>To break this deadlock, calls for lifting foreign exchange controls have long been widespread. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied it, they are not unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The reason for their hesitation and reluctance to implement decisive measures, even to the point of unwillingness to implement import-export linkage systems and disregarding the private exchange of privately held gold for foreign exchange, lies in their efforts to avoid stimulating prices.</p>
<p>Now that foreign exchange has been opened up, prices in general will inevitably fluctuate again, naturally adjusting to a new level. This is unavoidable. What we earnestly hope for is: (1) Designated banks must handle the settlement of incoming or outgoing foreign exchange at market prices and avoid creating additional complications, which would create another black market. In particular, the settlement of foreign exchange from exports must be facilitated as much as possible to promote exports and avoid the recurrence of smuggling. (2) The management of imports must be tightened to prevent foreign goods from being dumped, threatening the survival of national industries. (3) Strict prevention of capital flight to deepen the difficulties in the economic sector. (4) The supply of foreign exchange for people's livelihood necessities at par prices should be handled transparently to avoid criticism at home and abroad. (5) Within the possible range, a wide range of foreign exchange stabilization funds should be raised to fulfill the responsibility of regulation. Unnecessary fluctuations at the natural level should be prevented at any time to stabilize prices and stabilize life. (6) Various conveniences should be given to the recovery of foreign capital and the repatriation of profits to attract foreign capital and help construction.</p>
<p>What is a pity is that the authorities have never determined a large-scale purchase policy and sales steps for export goods. Although foreign exchange is moving, general local goods will inevitably blindly increase in price to offset the benefits gained from the exchange rate. This will lose an excellent opportunity to absorb foreign exchange and promote exports.</p>
<h3>Another Measure of the United States' Indulgence Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Japan's private foreign trade officially opened yesterday. A few days before the opening of trade, the Far Eastern Commission announced a resolution on Japan's temporary import and export policy and sent it to Supreme Commander MacArthur for implementation. According to a United Press report, the Far Eastern Commission has fully lent 137 million yuan to Japan as a revolving fund for import and export trade. On the 14th, just as the Japanese government and public were celebrating the opening of trade, MacArthur announced that he would lend Japan more than 500 million yuan as a trade fund, using Japan's gold and silver reserves as a tool to obtain foreign exchange. Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama, grateful for the many support of the Allied Headquarters, made an important report to the Diet with excitement, and the Diet passed a letter of thanks to MacArthur. The smiling faces of Katayama and the Diet members have forgotten the sorrow of surrendering in a desperate state two years ago and have begun to pursue a new future.</p>
<p>Regarding MacArthur's opening of Japan's private trade, we have already commented on the gains and losses to the Allied countries. Whether or not our country should agree to the opening of Japan's trade, the basic control lies with us. We have repeatedly stated the advantages and disadvantages. The editorial of this newspaper on July 29 pointed out that the Japanese government and people have formulated various ambitious plans for the opening of trade and hope to restore foreign trade to obtain a large loan of 1 billion from the United States. The so-called obligation to compensate the defeated country may be put aside, unasked and undiscussed. Looking at the news reports in the past few days, Japan's foreign trade has not only been successfully opened, but even MacArthur has publicly announced loans to Japan to invigorate its trade and develop its trade. This was something we expected, but MacArthur's tolerant and generous measures toward Japan will be a great loss to the rights of the Allied countries, and we cannot but express our dissent.</p>
<p>First, we do not oppose Japan's revitalization, but the Allied countries should jointly oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and aggression. Looking at Japanese newspapers and magazines, they have already formulated various economic revitalization plans, production increase plans, and the US loan to Japan of 1 billion US dollars plan, and use coal production increase and shipping income to fill the loan repayment; in fact, these production plans are the revival of capitalist economy, and may even exceed the level of 1930-34, if according to these plans, Japan's excess production will need a huge market, followed by plunder and aggression. Japan's existing industrial equipment has not yet been dismantled for compensation, even if dismantled according to the 1930 level, Japan's industrial equipment can still maintain an organic body, such as the United States loans Japan, Japan and then with manufactured goods in exchange for new machines, then Japan's new capitalism, will become a great view. Obviously, this is not economic revitalization, but the living of militarism and aggression factors, in the Allied countries' justice position, should express opposition.</p>
<p>Second, we advocate that Japan's compensation, in addition to in-kind compensation, should be carried out in cash compensation way, therefore now sealed Japan's gold treasures, should not be unsealed and transferred to trade funds. When Japan surrendered, the Allied Headquarters would seal Japan about 200 million US dollars, a saying that the value of 140 million US dollars of gold and treasures, according to the majority of the Allied countries' proposal, should be used for cash compensation, can not be transferred to other purposes. The so-called "cash compensation" is not a harsh request of the victorious country to the defeated country, there is a historical precedent. Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, I was defeated incense to compensate Japan 230 million taels, the Treaty of Versailles, Germany to the Allied countries also fulfill cash compensation obligations. Now. The Japanese Peace Conference has not yet been convened, the cash compensation issue is pending, now the Far East Committee has agreed to lend 137 million US dollars to Japan, probably refers to the unsealing of Japanese gold treasures, if there is such a thing, our judgment is not wrong, then the Allied countries self-destruct the compensation rights, for the future of the chaos, chiseled damage in the darkness, it is difficult to imagine. We stand in the Allied countries' justice position, should express anti-</p>
<p>Now the Allied countries and Japan peace treaty has not been concluded, the state of peace has not been restored, the United States unilateral action loans Japan, is very unwise, our Chinese folk newspapers attitude, and does not agree with the United States indulgence of Japan's another measure.</p>

<h3>Twenty American Foreign Ministers Gather in the Capital of Brazil to Discuss the Defense of American Peace; the Anti-Communist Issue is Especially Emphasized by Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] The Pan-American Conference opened at 4 pm today at the Quitandinha Hotel in Betero, located 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's summer capital. It is the second gathering of foreign ministers from American countries since 1945 to formulate a broad defense plan for the Western Hemisphere and maintain the peace and security of the American continent. The opening ceremony of today's conference was simple and grand, its sole purpose being to transform the wartime temporary defense plan of the American continent (namely, the Chapultepec Treaty) into a permanent one. The treaty was concluded at the Mexico Conference in 1945 and stipulates the use of force when necessary to protect the peace of the continent. Brazilian President Dutra delivered the opening speech, emphasizing the great significance of the conference. At the closing of this morning's preparatory meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister Fernandai Tiqi was elected chairman of the conference. The Uruguayan representative proposed to stop the civil war in Paraguay, and Argentina seconded the proposal. The action to stop the civil war is expected to be decided at the plenary session. A total of 20 countries are participating in this conference. Nicaragua was not invited because the Nicaraguan government, which came to power after the coup in May of this year, has not been recognized by any country on the American continent.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] The Pan-American Conference today revealed that the countries participating in the conference have agreed that aggression against any one of them is equivalent to aggression against all of them, so the countries will take collective action against the aggressor. However, various signs now indicate that the conference will inevitably fiercely debate how to agree on the question of taking action against the aggressor. Among them, 18 countries support using a two-thirds vote to bind the entire body. Argentina will defend the theory of using a unanimous vote as the basis for the collective action vote, which in fact is equivalent to a veto. Only Haiti supports Argentina's theory. Informed observers believe that this conference may focus on anti-communism, as the threat of communism has already lurked in the Americas.</p>
<h3>Marshall Clarifies the American Position on the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty, Advocating Collective Action Against Aggressors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] Marshall publicly announced the United States' position on the two-thirds voting system in the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty regarding the mobilization of defense, which will be signed here soon, at a press conference held after the opening of the Pan-American Conference this afternoon. Marshall said: The U.S. delegation will propose that the collective measures specifically stipulated in the Chapultepec Resolution, when agreed upon through consultation by a two-thirds vote, will be the common obligation of all contracting parties. The only exception is that no country may be forced to supply troops without its own permission. He also announced that the majority of American countries, in response to the proposed treaty, expressed agreement that the resolution on collective measures should be the common obligation of all contracting parties. According to the Chapultepec Resolution, contracting parties must also use various methods, such as severing diplomatic or commercial relations, and as a last resort, using force, to unanimously stop or combat aggressors.</p>
<h3>Soviet Proposal for International Control of Atomic Energy is Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The Soviet Union's attempt to have its proposal on atomic energy control accepted by the United Nations organization before the United Nations General Assembly is held in September failed finally today. The 12 members of the Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission recently passed a Canadian resolution with a majority of ten votes, confirming that the Soviet Union's international atomic energy control plan is not appropriate in its current form. Now that the Political Committee is facing an apparently insurmountable situation, it has decided to adjourn until August 25 to resume discussion of the second report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Freedom of the Press Conference to be Held in March Next Year</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] After three days of intense debate, the Economic and Social Council finally passed a resolution tonight to convene an international conference on freedom of the press in Geneva on March 23 next year.</p>
<h3>US Policy Toward Korea Remains Unchanged; Hodge's Policies are Not in Conflict with Washington; Brown Accuses the Soviet Side of Undermining Negotiations</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] The US State Department announced today that the US policy toward Korea remains consistent, that is, to ensure that Korea will become a free, united, and sovereign country, and to establish a democratic government that represents public opinion. It is inaccurate to say that the policies followed by US Commander Hodge in Korea are different from those stated here. The United States has only one policy toward Korea, and General Hodge is faithfully implementing it in a complex and difficult environment. At present, in addition to the funds that Congress has allocated to the War Department to assist Korea, Washington government agencies are now working closely with General Hodge to complete relevant research in order to further assist Korea.</p>
<p>[Sin-Ya News Agency, Seoul, 16th] US Representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Major General Brown, recently issued a statement stating that the current deadlock in the Joint Commission is due to the Soviet side's insistence on producing a list of political parties and organizations in the subcommittee, which is similar to exercising a veto. However, the Soviet side cannot provide sufficient evidence for the organizations it claims should be removed from the consultation. According to the Soviet side's proposal, the left-right balance of Korean political parties and organizations should be in a ratio of three to two, that is, the left wing must occupy an absolute advantage, which seems quite unfair.</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Vietnam Situation; the War May End; Bola returned home to report to the Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bola arrived in Lyon today to visit Prime Minister Rama de, who is participating in the Socialist Party Congress in the area, for talks. It is reported that Rama de will jointly return to Paris with Bola to convene a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Vietnam, and there may be a possibility of ending the eight-month war there. It is widely believed that Bola has already negotiated a ceasefire agreement with important figures in Weiming.</p>

<h3>Security Council Continues to Debate Indonesian Issue; Dutch Representative Faces All-Around Criticism; Philippine Representative Announces Formal Recognition of Indonesia on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] The Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue has lasted for two weeks. As of today, the theme of the debate can be summarized in the following point: Whether the United Nations can legally deal with matters that the Dutch government has recently referred to as "purely internal affairs." The Security Council did not conduct a formal vote on this issue tonight. US Representative Johnson suggested that the Security Council immediately adjourn and not make any decisions on this issue for the time being. This suggestion has been passed. Before Johnson's speech, the Australian representative fiercely criticized colonial countries, saying that they repeatedly accused the Security Council of legal jurisdiction in order to prevent the Council from taking action on the Indonesian issue. Dutch Representative Tseng bluntly stated that the Security Council had no ability to handle the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. Dutch Representative Kleffens said that the Dutch government would never intend to have the Security Council investigate the Dutch-Indonesian conflict and suggested two points: (1) Indonesia and the Netherlands should each select one country, and then these two countries should select an impartial third country to rely on the good offices of these three countries to report to the world on the situation in Indonesia. (2) All "professional consuls" stationed in Batavia should immediately draft a joint report on the situation in Indonesia. The Philippine representative announced that the Philippine government officially recognized the Indian Federation, Pakistan, and Indonesia today. He also strongly defended the Security Council's right to handle the Indonesian issue and asked the Security Council to take action immediately. The Philippines supported Australia's proposal, and Poland supported the Philippines.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 15th] According to a San Sai dispatch, as a result of the atrocities committed by the Ambonese troops belonging to the Dutch army on the 10th, 29 overseas Chinese were injured, including four seriously injured. The incident occurred because an overseas Chinese businessman accidentally bumped into an Ambonese soldier in a crowded market. The latter cursed the overseas Chinese, calling him a "dirty Chinese," and then used force.

Since President Truman announced yesterday that he did not intend to convene a special session of Congress before January, the report of the 16 European countries will not be accepted by Washington before then. The written questions previously submitted by the conference to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, asking him to answer various information about the Soviet military district, have been declared by the Soviet government to refuse, so the Soviet region of eastern Germany has been definitely excluded from the scope of the Marshall Plan.</p>

<h3>Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone Announces: Cracking Down on Communist Bandit Espionage Agency; Eleven Principal and Accessory Offenders Arrested in Shanghai; Large Quantities of Documents, Books, Intelligence Originals, and Counterfeit Money Seized</h3>
<p>The Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone recently announced the cracking of a communist bandit military espionage agency case. The details are as follows: Since the Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone was forced to strike at the communist bandits in northern Jiangsu last July, according to the intelligence gathered from various sources, the bandit side had established a military espionage agency in Shanghai, specializing in reconnaissance of the National Army's movements, troop strength, and numbers, which were transmitted to the bandit army at any time for advance deployment. It also engaged in activities that endangered the National Army's actions, and the organization was massive in scale. It was later discovered that "Lu Zhiying, the Shanghai Special Commissioner of the Liaison Department of the Central China Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party," was the principal instigator of the northern Jiangsu communist bandit military espionage agency. Lu's whereabouts, address, and his front organizations were also obtained from various intelligence sources. Because Lu and his accomplices had a vast network and were extremely alert, in order to quickly crack the case and prevent leaks, officers were dispatched to Shanghai to secretly arrest Lu Zhiying. A large number of documents, books, intelligence originals, and counterfeit banknotes with face values of 500 yuan and 2,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan in legal currency, were seized from Lu Zhiying's residence on the third floor of No. 8, Lane 3, Route Ghisi. In his front organizations, including the Datong Food Store, Weida Food Company, and Ruijucheng Food Company, his accomplices Lu Kexu, Fu Youzhai, Chen Huihe, Wu Xiuzhen, Wu Baolin, Zhuang Feng, Yao Yongxiang, Yang Ying, Sun Yiqiang, She Guangde, and others were arrested. A large number of documents, books, printing plates, and other items were seized.</p>
<p>Lu Zhiying's Crimes</p>
<p>Based on the seized documents, Lu Zhiying's crimes were found to be: (1) Hosting communist bandit military espionage in northern Jiangsu, probing military secrets, and endangering our military actions. (2) Reconnoitering our army's movements, codes, and numbers to supply the bandit army, carrying out actions detrimental to our army. (3) Smuggling ammunition and firearms to supply the bandit army for combat. (4) Privately transporting materials for export, obtaining military supplies and raw materials to supply the bandit army and prolong the rebellion. (5) Establishing a Shanghai uprising special operations organization, and being responsible for developing and deploying special agents' networks in the Northeast, Qingdao, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places. (6) Infiltrating various military and political organs to engage in counterintelligence work. (7) Purchasing various military telephone and telecommunications materials and transporting them to various parts of northern Jiangsu for the bandit army's use. (8) Printing a large number of counterfeit banknotes to disrupt the financial system. (9) Establishing transportation and liaison work in coastal counties. (10) Planning various riots to brew bloodbaths as pretexts. (11) Attempting to instigate mutiny. Lu Zhiying and others' actions constitute the crimes of rebellion, endangering the state, and counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law. The principal and accessory offenders have been successively arrested. The Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone believes that Lu and others' crimes are obvious and undeniable, and they had to be arrested to eradicate the communist bandits' dangerous schemes. However, due to the serious nature of the case, investigation takes time after the arrest to ensure that no one is wrongly accused or let off, so the announcement was delayed until now. Lu Zhiying and others are currently being interrogated and judged according to law.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Arrested During Activities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Funing County Government sent a telegram to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters last month, stating that Township Head Yang Dianying reported that Huang Huiming, a recidivist who violated the regulations on repentance and self-renewal, and bandit party member Hui Shengmao had fled to Shanghai together and were living in Zhuan Mingfu's home. Hui Huiming had killed Kuomintang member Zhou Weilu and landlords Hui Mingling and Dai Yuanfeng. They requested a nearby arrest. The headquarters also received a report from Hui Zuzuo, stating that Hui Huiming had killed his father. After police investigation, it was discovered that Hui was in the Zhabei Datong Road area, disguised as a rickshaw repairman. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him. He confessed that he was under the command of Zhang Buda, the New Fourth Army's person in charge in Shanghai, and was doing intelligence work. Zhang Buda was then arrested. Yesterday morning, the police department transferred the two criminals, Hui and Zhang, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Communist Prisoner Sun Bingcheng Bitterly Recalls the Past; The So-Called Liberated Area Is Actually a Living Hell; Fourteen-Year-Old Soldier Dared Not Write Home</h3>
<p>The first batch of 1,799 communist bandit prisoners from the Northeast arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th aboard the Hai Zhou, awaiting transfer to Wuchang for centralized training. Reporters from various Shanghai newspapers went to the Qiujiang Wharf yesterday morning to board the Hai Zhou to interview the prisoners. They were all surprised and grateful for the generous treatment they were currently receiving and testified that their belief that the National Army was barbaric was the result of malicious propaganda. Sun Chengcheng, a communist party member who served in the Eighth Route Army for eight years and once served as a county government secretary and liaison instructor, declared with sincere emotion after bitterly recounting the communist party's crimes: "From now on, I will forever stand on the side of the government and will never reconcile with the communist party. I will, from a position of justice, denounce to the world the anesthetic education I was forced to receive in the past!"</p>
<p>Subjected to Thought Control</p>
<p>Sun is a native of Taian County, Shandong Province, originally named Sun Dianchen, 27 years old. He received higher primary school education and later graduated from the bandit side's Jian Guo School and Binhai Middle School. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was a guerrilla in his hometown. Later, he was persuaded by the bandit army to join the bandit side. In 1940, he officially became a communist party member and fought in various parts of Shandong. Later, he secretly went to Guanwai with the bandit army. When he was captured, he was the company instructor of the Independent First Division (commander named Wu Duanlin) of the Liaodong Military Region of the bandit side. He claimed that everything in the past was the result of being deceived, subjected to thought control, and restricted in his actions, with no freedom at all.</p>
<p>Being Captured Is a Fortunate Thing</p>
<p>Now he has regained sight from the darkness. He stated: If given the opportunity, he is willing to join the National Army to fight and serve as a "pioneer" in recovering the entire Shandong. Sun also announced to the public, based on his actual experience of participating in the bandit army's rebellion for many years: Except for a few stubborn veteran cadres, all soldiers in the soldier class are tired of war, but the bandit side's cadres have extremely strict control, and there are few opportunities to escape, so everyone considers being captured a fortunate thing. The lives of the bandit army soldiers are extremely bitter, with a monthly salary of only 50 yuan in bandit currency, not enough to buy two packs of cigarettes. Many party officials are involved in corruption and malpractice. The class struggle they are trying to pursue has caused the rich to flee and the poor to hate. The so-called "liberated area" is actually a human "living hell."</p>
<p>Tears Streaming Down His Face</p>
<p>Another person, Li Shuheng, is only 14 years old, a native of Harbin with parents, brothers, and sisters. When he was studying in a private school at the beginning of this year, he was captured by the bandit army to serve as a messenger. His family members are currently unaware of his whereabouts. This innocent little soldier told reporters that he missed his family very much, but he is not allowed to write a letter to inform his family, fearing that the bandit side would find out and slaughter his entire family. As he spoke, tears could not help but stream down his face.</p>

<h3>Case of Famine Relief Rice Entering the Black Market: Three Rice Merchants Interrogated for the First Time; The Owner of Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Shop, a Principal Suspect, Detained</h3>
<p>The case of the [Relief] Federation's allocated famine relief rice entering the black market was investigated for the first time at the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. The Relief Federation allocated famine relief rice to the Relief Administration, which was then distributed to the Yangzi Jiang River Conservancy Commission and national schools in various counties for use. Unexpectedly, Xu Burong, the director of the education section of the Xinghua County Government, Principal Zhang, Principal Jie, Ma Zhenhai, the principal of the Anting Town Central National School in Kunshan, Yao Renlong, the principal of the Qiwang Town National School in Wuxian, and others privately sold the famine relief rice to the Longmao Rice Shop in Zhenjiang, which then sold it on the black market, totaling more than 3,000 bags. Rice merchants Song Xijing and Li Enzhong from this city went to Zhenjiang to purchase rice and transported the famine relief rice to Shanghai, storing it in the Tongtai Gong Rice Mill at No. 96 Ninghai West Road. In mid-last month, Fang Deng, an American inspector from the Relief Federation, and Wei Tongsheng, a British inspector, discovered this and reported it to the Relief Federation, which informed the Relief Administration and requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu interrogated rice merchants Song Xijing and Li Sizhong yesterday and ordered them to return. He Junheng, the owner of the Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Shop, is a major suspect and has been detained. Fang Deng also appeared in court yesterday as a witness, stating that there is a detailed investigation report, which is currently at the Relief Administration. Prosecutor Zhu is currently writing to the county governments of Xinghua, Kunshan, and Wuxian, requesting them to investigate, and has also written to the Relief Administration, requesting to view Fang Deng's investigation report to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 9:45 PM last night, Meng Yu and Cai Zhangchu, two soldiers from the construction road general team training regiment, were enjoying the cool air on the Zhenru railway station platform. At about 10:00 PM, a Beijing-Shanghai night train passed by. When the railway police stepped forward to dissuade them, an argument broke out, which led to violence. Comrades from both sides rushed to the scene to mediate. In the chaos, several gunshots were suddenly heard, hitting Meng Yu in the head and Cai Zhangchu in the waist. They were sent to the Railway Public Charity Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the relevant authorities ordered officials to thoroughly investigate the truth and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Following the Example of Local Worthies: Loyalty and Courage to Serve the Country; Comfort Meeting at Zhongzheng Park Welcomes Hunan New Recruits Passing Through; Communist Special Agents Were Physically Fit, Many with High School or University Education</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Hunan expatriates in Shanghai, including Chuan Zhengqi, Zhang Wei, Fang Dingying, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Weicheng, held a comfort meeting at Zhongzheng Park yesterday afternoon to welcome the Hunan new recruits passing through Shanghai and to encourage the soldiers going on expedition. More than 8,000 new recruits arrived in formation before 3:00 PM. Representatives from various sectors, including Fang Zhi from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Xie Renzhao, Zhang Xiaosong from the Civil Affairs Office, and Xie Dahuang from the Military Service Association, also attended.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Fang Dingying, the chairman of the presidium, delivered a welcome speech. Fang Zhi, Xie Dahuang, and others also spoke, praising the patriotic spirit displayed by Hunan throughout history and listing the glorious deeds of Hunan people who were loyal and courageous in serving the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They hoped that the new recruits would carry on the glorious footsteps of their predecessors under the national policy of suppressing rebellion and building the country. Subsequently, Zhang Kai, an 11-year-old Hunan child living in Shanghai, gave a speech. When he shouted in his passionate Hunan accent, "Today I am here to send you off on your expedition, and one day I will be here to welcome you back in triumph," the whole audience burst into applause, and some new recruits were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes.</p>
<p>Although After a Long Journey, Standing Tall Without Fatigue</p>
<p>After Jiang Changbao, a representative of the new recruits, spoke, the conference distributed 50 million yuan in condolence money and 5,000 packages of condolence medicine. Although the new recruits had traveled a long distance, they stood tall in the hot sun for two hours yesterday without any fatigue. When Commander Wei and Committee Chairman Fang stepped forward to ask them individual questions, the new recruits unanimously replied, "The accommodations are very comfortable, and the food is also excellent." Their words expressed deep gratitude for the concern shown by the millions of citizens of this city.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongfan, the commander of the Hunan South Garrison District New Recruit Corps, led the Hunan new recruits to Shanghai this time. According to him, the 10,000 people who arrived in Shanghai this time included the first batch of new recruits recruited from the four garrison districts in southeast, northwest Hunan. There are three more batches, totaling 30,000 people, who will also be recruited and developed one after another. The people of Hunan are actively participating in the recruitment, considering being recruited a great honor. Hunan was a revolutionary base in the past, and patriots and great men have emerged in every generation, so the patriotic feelings of the people are far higher than in other places.</p>
<p>Promoting National Health Is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>Not only are they physically strong, but also percentage. For university qualifications" percentage of 25 have high school qualifications, and percentage of 20 are merchants and farmers, farmers accounting for only half of the total number, which shows that their enlistment this time is entirely out of patriotic enthusiasm.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter visited Shanghai Garrison District Commander Chuan Zhengmo. Commander Fu expressed regret over the phenomenon of people in the Jiangnan area neglecting military service. He was particularly impressed by the physical strength of the people of Hunan. According to investigations, more than 50 percentage of the new recruits recently recruited in Suzhou have venereal diseases. He said: "Even if they are not drafted, these people will become a waste to the country, so promoting national morality and national health is more urgent than military service work."</p>
<p>Chief of General Staff Chen Cares About the Treatment of New Recruits</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense pays close attention to the management and treatment of new recruits awaiting transportation in Shanghai. Chief of General Staff Chen recently sent a telegram ordering Shanghai Garrison District Commander Fu to be responsible for supervising and assessing, and if his cadres commit embezzlement, abuse, or malpractice against the new recruits, the garrison district is allowed to detain and report the situation according to the severity of the circumstances.</p>

<h3>Pregnant Woman Gives Birth on Train, Falls to the Ground with a Cry, Everyone Is Delighted</h3>
<p>No Medical Facilities on the Train, Many Kind People on the Journey</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A single pregnant woman boarded the 75th Xihu second and third class regional train on the Beijing-Shanghai line at 7:00 AM on the 13th of this month when it passed through Suzhou Station. The woman's surname is Jiang, from Suzhou, her husband's name is Shen Hongchun, living at No. 131 Yunnan Middle Road, Shanghai. She had recently returned to Ningbo and, knowing that her delivery date was near, was urgently preparing to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, not long after the train started, the pregnant woman cried out in pain. Passengers on the train offered condolences. Two female passengers, seeing this situation, asked and learned that the woman was full-term and knew that she was about to give birth. They discussed it with the conductor and helped Shen Jiang to the rear carriage, which was more sheltered from the wind, and the passengers gave up their seats so that she could recline on the chairs. The pregnant woman cried out in pain frequently. The railway police accompanying the train searched all the carriages for an obstetrician and midwife, but to no avail. At about 8:00 AM, as the train approached Weiting Station, the pregnant woman's abdominal pain worsened. When it stopped at Zhengyi Station, they urgently sent a station attendant to summon a midwife. Before the midwife arrived, the woman let out a cry, and the baby fell to the ground with a cry. After a while, the midwife arrived and examined the pregnant woman's health, and both mother and child were safe. The passengers on the train congratulated each other. Everyone was delighted. When the train arrived at Kunshan Station, two unknown passengers on the train helped the pregnant woman and the baby to the Qinghui Clinic for examination. After the 75th train arrived in Shanghai, the railway bureau sent someone to No. 131 Yunnan Middle Road to notify her husband. The railway bureau, due to this incident, notified station personnel to pay attention at all times and to prohibit pregnant women from taking the train to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in Nanshi Fire: Seven People Killed or Injured Under the Wheels</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Han Zhongxiang, who lived in a bungalow at No. 8, Xin Jianli, Xiaoximen, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, was in the wax board business. At about 8:00 PM last night, he accidentally started a fire while melting sandalwood with gasoline, which spread to the houses on both sides. The Nanshi Central District and South District fire brigades rushed to the scene to put out the fire. In total, three bungalows were burned down. At the time, the Xin Kaihe Fire Department also dispatched two pump trucks. One truck, driven by driver Shou Xigong, was heading south, passing Xiaodongmen and Xiaonanmen, and when it reached the entrance of Tianshengtang Chinese Pharmacy at No. 879 Zhonghua Road, a rickshaw with the number 10906 was blocking the way, and a tricycle with the number 15753 was coming head-on. Shou Xigong swerved to avoid them, and crashed into many people enjoying the cool air, killing and injuring them. A girl, Zhang Guohua, was run over and killed. Her sister, Zhang Guoxiang (11 years old), was seriously injured (living at No. 5, Fu'anli, Baiyang Lane). A nine-year-old boy, Yan Maotou, died. A seven-year-old boy, Wang Lindi (living at No. 859, Baiyang Lane), an 18-year-old girl, Lu Xinnv, and a three-year-old boy, Wu Rongfa, were seriously injured (both boys and girls live at No. 6, Yangyinli). A seventeen-year-old boy, Xiao Jiafang, was seriously injured. Afterwards, a large number of police officers from the Penglai Police Branch rushed to the scene and sent the injured to the hospital and the bodies to the Tongren Fuyuantang. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, upon hearing the report, sent personnel from the Criminal Division to investigate the truth of the accident and take photographs back. Rickshaw driver Sun Ruquan and driver Shou Xigong were taken to the Penglai Branch for investigation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Fifteen Deng Case: Family Members Protest at the High Court, Demanding Death Sentences, Ordering Them to Say Where the Bodies Are Buried</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zou Baoxian, the former head of Xi'an Township in Qingpu County, and Yu Kesheng, the head of Xiaoyin Township, were responsible for the brutal murder of fifteen people, including Yuan Liu, residents of northern Jiangsu, on February 28, 1945. The High Court previously sentenced Zou Baoxian, the principal offender, to life imprisonment for the crime of treason and murder, and the accessory offenders Yang Ada and Xue Shunde are still at large. The families of the victims also filed a civil lawsuit, which the District Court ruled in their favor, awarding compensation of 131.1 million yuan and allowing provisional execution.</p>
<p>After the families of the victims received the District Court's judgment the day before yesterday, because the bodies of all the defendants have not yet been found, dozens of them gathered yesterday morning and protested at the High Court. Starting at 9:00 AM, they knelt and cried at the entrance of the High Court, holding incense in their hands and shouting for justice, attracting a large crowd of onlookers. The court police tried to dissuade them to no avail, and for a time the traffic on North Zhejiang Road was blocked. After the stalemate lasted until 12:00 PM, Guo Yunquan, the president of the High Court, instructed Clerk Feng to come out and inquire about the situation, ordering the family members to enter the second floor of the court. Clerk Feng temporarily opened a court to interrogate them. The family members of the victims immediately made three requests: (1) Order the former township heads to state where the bodies are buried so that the family members can claim them for burial. (2) Promptly pay the compensation to alleviate the urgent needs of the families of the victims. (3) Hopefully, the principal and accessory offenders in the case will be sentenced to death. Clerk Feng comforted the family members extensively at the time, promising to check the files and reply within one week, and instructed the families of the victims to return and await the legal resolution. The families then knelt down one after another, expressing their gratitude and leaving.</p>
<h3>Xu Shichang Transferred</h3>
<p>Appointed in the capacity of Commissioner</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xu Shichang, the director of the General Affairs Department of the Relief Administration, was ordered to transfer from yesterday. The main reason is said to be related to Liu Dewei, the director of the disaster relief and welfare department. Bi Gaokui, the current inspector of the Investigation Department, has been internally designated as his successor. Xu Shichang has been transferred to the position of commissioner, still working at the Relief Administration.</p>
<h3>Concerning Allegations of Corruption: Executive Headquarters Issues Statement of Facts, Claiming All Transactions Have Receipts and Accounting Records to Prove</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters (行總) issued a written statement of "True Facts" in response to recent reports concerning allegations of corruption within the Headquarters. The full text is as follows: "A certain news agency's so-called accusations against this office first stated that "only a little over 10,000 electric fans were actually distributed, while the Headquarters' purchasing and sales office reported selling over 20,000, meaning over 10,000 were embezzled by corrupt individuals." It is important to note that the electric fans recently sold by this office's purchasing and sales office were surplus US Navy ship fans. The United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) joint distribution conference deemed them unsuitable for market demand, fearing that individual retail sales would be unsuccessful. It was resolved to advertise for bids. After three public advertisements, only 500 units were sold, and the second and third advertisements received no bids.</p>
<p>Stopped Selling Electric Fans</p>
<p>To clear the accumulated stock, a trial retail sale was advertised. Due to the low price, only 400,000 yuan per unit, buyers rushed to purchase them, causing overcrowding and disorder at the sales locations. Over 500 letters were also received from various institutions requesting purchases. To avoid the commotion, this office decided to halt retail sales and instead distribute them free of charge to relevant institutions in need. A total of 1,800 units were distributed to the Ministry of Transportation, 2,000 to various hospitals, and over 7,600 were sold at retail locations. The remaining small quantities were distributed free of charge, all documented with distribution slips. At the time, the sudden halt to retail sales caused dissatisfaction, leading to rumors. The Office of the Comptroller has dispatched personnel to investigate, and the truth should be clarified soon. As for the claim that "the China Merchants Bureau requested 200 units, but the office forced them to change the application to 300 units, while only actually providing 200," the China Merchants Bureau has records to prove it, and this office does not need to respond.</p>
<p>Cotton-for-Yarn Issue</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the so-called "cotton-for-yarn issue," this office sold United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) American cotton to various manufacturers. The Executive Yuan approved a method of exchanging cotton for yarn spun by the manufacturers. This office, in conjunction with the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) and the Economic Department's Textile Control Committee, decided, based on the actual raw material needs for spinning yarn and the labor costs and market prices of cotton and yarn, to exchange 760 pounds of foreign cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count Zhangjiang yarn. Since this was established, it has been filed with the Executive Yuan and has been followed as precedent. As for the claim that accounting entries do not match the regulations, the actual quantity of goods received by each factory is based on the weight slips. The claim that 90 pounds fell into the hands of corrupt individuals is simply unfounded.</p>
<p>Wheat-to-Flour Ratio</p>
<p>(3) The so-called technical issue of water seeping into wheat is practically impossible. This office receives American wheat from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) and entrusts it to various flour mills such as Shanghai Fuxin for milling into uniform flour. The regulation stipulates that 100 jin of American wheat should yield 90 jin of uniform flour and 8 jin of bran, with the remaining 2 jin being the mill's processing loss. This flour yield ratio and moisture content percentage are determined by experts from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總). The flour produced must undergo regular and direct spot checks by experts from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總). There have been no instances of excessive moisture content. If the moisture content were to increase, the flour would quickly mold and clump. The factories still have flour in storage that has not molded over time, which proves the facts and requires no further explanation. The rumor that "five jin of water are added per shi, and the five jin surplus is embezzled through corruption" is self-defeating.</p>
<p>Transportation Costs Had Discounts</p>
<p>(4) The so-called transportation kickbacks are purely based on misunderstanding. The materials handled by this office are for relief purposes, so discount measures for reduced transportation costs were negotiated with various transportation agencies. All state-run and private Chinese shipping companies transporting materials for this office charged 75% of the China Merchants Bureau's freight rates. Railway freight rates were also calculated at 75% until the end of October last year. Since November of last year, they have been calculated at a special contract price of 45 yuan per ton-kilometer, which increased to 135 yuan in July of this year. The so-called discount is not a commission but a reduction in transportation fees charged to this office by the carrier, in accordance with regulations, to reduce the expenses of this office.</p>
<p>Housing, Refrigerators, Coal</p>
<p>(5) The house at 570 Jian Guo West Road is the residence for the director and deputy director of this office and is not solely occupied by Deputy Director Li Zhuomin's family. The refrigerator inside the house is a relic from the previous owner and is not a United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) item. Ordinary staff dormitories of this office are assigned managers and servants. The Jian Guo West Road residence usually only has five workers. The rumor that "Deputy Director Li refused to allocate funds to assist in the Guangdong disaster but instead squeezed 500 million yuan to rent dormitories for staff" clearly lacks factual basis. The 500 million yuan for the Guangdong disaster relief has already been remitted to Guangdong. This office has never used 500 million yuan to rent housing.</p>
<p>Vehicles are for Public Use</p>
<p>Furthermore, the news agency's report involved Hu Keshi, director of the Fisheries Management Office. Director Hu was only appointed to take over the Fisheries Management Office last week, having been in office for less than a week. As for the claim that "General Affairs Director Xu Shichang has as many as three private cars," it is a misunderstanding referring to the official vehicles managed by the General Affairs Office. Mr. Xu does not have any private cars, and the municipal government's Public Utilities Bureau's license records can be checked. This office has detailed receipts and accounting records to verify all of the above. The administration of this office generally follows the principle of layered responsibility, and each level of staff is responsible for their own administrative responsibilities. We sincerely hope that the supervisory authorities will come to this office to investigate separately to clarify the facts." It is noted that before taking over the Fisheries Management Office, Hu Keshi was the previous director of the General Affairs Office of the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Director Huo in Nanjing Reports to President Zhang</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Executive Headquarters Director Huo Shishu arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 16th to attend the political affairs meeting.

<h3>Prosecutors Visit the Executive Headquarters Yesterday, Offices Quiet and Desolate</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The preliminary investigation into the case of alleged corruption by Executive Headquarters Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others was initially disregarded by the District Prosecutor's Office because it was an anonymous letter. However, yesterday morning, Executive Headquarters Director Huo Zishu, in order to clarify the true facts, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office requesting that personnel be dispatched to investigate. The letter stated that it was a disgruntled dismissed employee making the accusations. Chief Prosecutor Huang dispatched Prosecutors He Huimin and Zhang Yuanzhen to conduct a thorough investigation yesterday morning. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor He Huimin, accompanied by Secretary Wu Chengji and two bailiffs, arrived at the Executive Headquarters but was stopped by the gatekeeper, who stated that the office was closed for the afternoon and requested that they return another day. Prosecutor He explained the purpose of their visit, entered and inspected the office for a week, and saw that except for the gatekeeper, there was not a single person present. Since no one greeted them, they did not sit down to rest and left after staying for about three minutes. Prosecutor He plans to return to investigate again tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Executive Headquarters Director Huo sent Chief Secretary Lu Hanqin to visit Comptroller Yan Zhuang yesterday morning to explain the matter of someone anonymously accusing senior Executive Headquarters officials of group corruption, and expressed welcome for the Comptroller to dispatch personnel to investigate. According to Comptroller Yan's statement at the time, he would not act hastily and would dispatch personnel within a day or two to handle the matter impartially. It is also reported that Comptroller Yan told reporters afterward that the anonymous accuser had a real name and address, suggesting that it was not a malicious accusation. The content of the accusation was very detailed and listed a lot of evidence. He hopes that all parties will provide more information in the future to facilitate a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] At around 1 PM on the 10th, a man boarded an English merchant's trolleybus on Route 24, claimed to be a member of the inspection team, and refused to purchase a ticket, leading to a conflict with the ticket inspector.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhou Xingfa, a 29-year-old man from Fenghua, works in the banking industry and has a good income and no family burdens, so he has accumulated some savings.

However, three days after the wedding, Zhou returned home from work and suddenly found that his home was empty, not only were all the clothes and accessories gone, but even the wedding certificate and both rings were missing. At this time, Zhou realized that he had fallen into the "White Wolf" scheme arranged by Dong Yinshi and lost both his person and property. He filed a complaint with the District Court, accusing Dong Yinshi of fraud and stated that if Dong's daughter were harbored, he would file charges of theft and fraud separately.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Reporters Arrive in Gutian to Visit Hydroelectric Power Project</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 16th] The Fuzhou reporters recently went to Gutian, northern Fujian, at the invitation of the Provincial Government, to visit the Gutian Creek Hydroelectric Power Project, and returned to Fuzhou late last night. The roads in northern Fujian are badly damaged, with much of the road surface washed away by mountain floods. The reporters traveled 136 kilometers in a jeep, reaching their destination after a bumpy ride. Banditry in Gutian is rampant. A certain branch of the Communist bandits' Peace and National Salvation Army, led by Zuo Fengmei, with over 200 men and guns, is roaming the border of the county and recently looted four granaries. The reporters even heard the sound of fierce fighting between soldiers and bandits when they were about to reach the county seat. Under the guidance of the project personnel, the reporters set out on foot along mountain paths and sheep trails to Guise and Cao Yang to visit the hydroelectric power project and the diversion section of the Longting Waterfall. The Longting Waterfall is located in a deep mountain valley, with spray splashing high like a thin mist. The county's waterfall spray is a spectacular sight. The project is massive. When completed in the future, it will be a major driving force for the industrialization of Fujian Province.</p>
<h3>Early Rice Harvesting Season Arrives, Fujian Province Rushes to Collect Delinquent Taxes</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 12th] The Fujian Provincial Government believes that the accumulated tax arrears of various counties are quite large. Now that the early rice harvest is underway, the opportunity should be seized to intensify the collection efforts. It has specifically approved four measures, ordering all counties to collect all outstanding taxes by the end of August. Households with outstanding taxes who continue to resist and delay payment, regardless of their identity or background, will be handed over to the judicial authorities for investigation in accordance with the law. Clearing old debts will greatly facilitate the opening of new taxes.</p>
<h3>Fujian Police Security Office Cracks Down on Bandit Gangs</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 12th] Bandit gangs are rampant in the border areas and coastal areas of Fujian Province. Notable ones include Liu Yongsheng's gang in western Fujian, Chen Gu Lao's gang in northern Fujian, Huang Guojing's gang in eastern Fujian, and Chen Hengyuan's gang in southern Fujian. They gather and disperse from time to time, ravaging the local areas, or harassing township offices, or attacking granaries, or intercepting boats and vehicles, greatly affecting public safety. The Provincial Police Security Office should specifically divide the counties where banditry is active into three suppression zones and eight self-defense zones, equip police security brigades (i.e., the original security teams) to vigorously suppress them, and mobilize local forces to build bunkers and defensive works to prevent bandit raids. After four-sided encirclement and suppression, the main force of each bandit gang has shown signs of collapse.</p>
<h3>Shi Fuhai Brutally Murdered in Tianjin, Russian Suspect Lai Chai Confesses Unreservedly</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch] Shi Fuhai, the Chinese manager of the Shanghai China Continental Machinery Company (31 years old, from Nanjing), and Lai Chai, the deputy manager of the company (Soviet, 24 years old), brought a batch of new sewing machine documents from Shanghai to Tianjin on the 14th of last month for promotion. On the morning of August 8th, Shi was suddenly murdered in the Tailai Hotel, a first-class inn where he was staying in Tianjin. The murderer has been identified as Lai Chai, who came with Shi. When the bloody case occurred (3 AM on the 8th), Wang Zhiping, a student at the Shenyang Second Institute of Technology, and his wife Guo Yufen, who were staying in Room 106 next to Shi Fuhai's Room 105 in the Tailai Hotel, were suddenly awakened from their sleep by a noise from next door and heard someone cry "Ah!" Then there was no more sound. At the same time, Zheng Suzhen, an actress staying in Room 104 next door, was also awakened by the screams. She specifically looked out the window at the street but found nothing, so she did not pay any further attention. At 7 AM, Lai Chai came from outside with a bottle of half milk and a piece of bread, and called the tea boy to open Room 105 and enter. He saw that Shi Fuhai had died on the bed, and dropped the milk and bread he was holding to the ground, cried out, and went straight to the Tenth Police Station to report the case.</p>
<p>When the police station received Lai Chai's report, they immediately found bloodstains on Lai Chai's clothes and hands. After a thorough examination, they saw scratches on Lai Chai's left ear, arm, and right cheek, bloodstains on his left leg, front abdomen, and hands, a red mark on his right palm as if he had been holding something tightly, knife wounds on his left middle finger, index finger, and arm, and a new cone-shaped wound on the lower back of his right leg. When questioned about his whereabouts, he stammered and looked flustered. The police station immediately determined that Lai Chai was highly suspicious and detained him for detailed interrogation. Lai Chai finally confessed to murdering Shi Fuhai unreservedly. The local authorities are still reviewing how Lai Chai will be handled.</p>
<p>Shi Fuhai was a Muslim. After the police station buried his body, the Shanghai Muslim Association telegraphed the Ping Muslim Association to ask the Tianjin branch to request the police station's permission to move Shi's remains to the Tianjin Muslim Cemetery. All this is waiting for Shi Fuhai's father to come to Tianjin from Shanghai to take care of the matter. It is learned that Shi and Lai Chai had been at odds for a long time. After they arrived in Tianjin, Shi Hai's father and wife frequently sent letters from Shanghai, asking Shi to be strictly on guard against Lai Chai, but in the end, he could not avoid this tragedy.</p>

<h3>Police Headquarters - Inside the Criminal Experiment Laboratory - The Mysterious Nine Groups · Agile Performances - The Lie Detector Enough to Make Criminals Tremble - Police Dogs Can Search Out Hidden Matchboxes</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent Ding Yuan, 15th] Criminal police are extremely common in European and American countries, but in China it is still a pioneering endeavor. As the name implies, criminal police are still in the "experimental" stage, and even this experiment has only been in existence for a year. When the Ministry of Interior's Police Headquarters was established on August 15th last year, under the leadership of Director Tang Zong, the Criminal Experiment Case began receiving equipment from the former Sino-American Cooperative Organization and transporting it to Nanjing.</p>
<p>The primary task of the criminal police is the prevention and investigation of crimes, with the collection and identification of evidence as the first step. In today's era of scientific advancement, criminals' techniques are increasing daily, so the collection and identification of evidence must rely on the coordination of scientific equipment and technology. Sadly, the equipment in the criminal experiment laboratory, although keeping around two hundred police officers busy, is only the size of a state police department in the United States. At best, this equipment is only sufficient for Jiangsu Province, but how does our province's transportation compare to that of a state in the United States? Currently, this equipment is still the only one in the entire country. In a place like Shanghai, where there are countless criminal incidents every day, if this set of equipment could be moved to Shanghai for use, it is believed that it would definitely prevent some crimes from happening or allow crimes to be solved quickly. Wasn't the cracking of the gold broker Yu Shengxiao's case due to the effectiveness of the criminal police equipment?</p>
<p>From 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on the 15th,</p>
<p>Director Tang Zong hosted judicial and press figures closely related to the police to visit the Criminal Experiment Laboratory, as a commemoration of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Police Headquarters. Under the guidance of many responsible personnel, we successively visited eight groups, including physical and chemical, technical, electrical, photographic, fingerprint, forensic, and police dog groups. Only the police pigeon group was not visited. These nine groups constitute the foundation of the Criminal Experiment Laboratory. At one moment, we seemed to be walking into a hospital, and at another, we were entering a physical and chemical laboratory. The responsible personnel spoke while wiping the beads of sweat from their foreheads. The air was fresh, the layout was neat, and the staff in each room wore white uniforms, much like doctors in a hospital. It is worth noting that the balance in the physical and chemical group has an accuracy of one ten-thousandth. When the experiment is in progress,</p>
<p>even a single strand of hair shows its weight on the balance. This is prepared for measuring the slightest poisons. The technical group has a lie detector, which is something that can make criminals tremble. The principle of lie detection is based on the relationship between the electrical reactions and the psychological and physiological aspects of the human body. The lie detector's effectiveness is usually 75 percent, but the experience and knowledge of the lie detector operator are very important. It is said that there are only two machines in the world, one here and one in the United States. The electrical group's tape recorder is for preventing criminals from retracting their confessions. The recording is done on the spot and can be played back immediately. Deputy Minister Tao Xisheng was invited by the group in charge to give a five-minute speech on evidence collection and identification. A minute later, we heard him speaking there for the second time. The photographic group's X-ray equipment is lightweight and can be moved and transported at any time, suitable for taking photos at the "scene." The "comparison microscope" in the firearms examination group can determine whether a shell casing or bullet and a suspected firearm are suspicious. Under</p>
<p>microscopic photography, the lines on the bullet or shell casing become ironclad evidence. The equipment in the fingerprint group is now widely used. Here, there is a more special device, which is a corpse fingerprinting box. The fingers of a corpse are stiff and cannot be imprinted, but three kinds of chemicals make the fingerprints of a corpse indistinguishable from those of a living person.</p>
<p>The police dog section put on a "live performance." These police dogs are well-trained. They can rescue police officers by biting through the ropes that bind people. They can perform a "field search" and find a suitcase containing opium in many pieces of luggage. They can carry out "criminal tracking" and, based on the footprints on the route, they can even find a matchbox picked up by a stranger. The police dogs' performance was very interesting and left a deep impression on the visitors.</p>
<p>This equipment can be described as a "dragnet." No matter how skillfully you commit a crime, you will hardly escape the nets set by these instruments and equipment that supplement human power. Now, Director Tang Zong has the</p>
<p>ambition to expand the equipment. He hopes to distribute criminal police to various places so that the crimes most likely to occur in society will be greatly reduced due to the widespread presence of criminal police. Who is willing to test the law? No item in the criminal experiment laboratory will let go of criminals.</p>
<p>After visiting the Criminal Experiment Laboratory for two hours, seeing the various pieces of equipment and instruments, and hearing the various explanations and descriptions, when the last program was completed, I thought to myself: "From now on, people who break the law will definitely not dare to break the law."</p>
<p>Reducing crime is a kind of social progress. I hope that the Police Headquarters will have greater success in the field of criminal police.</p>

<h3>Cry of Peking University Professor - Professor's Children Cannot Afford Books - Salary Only Sustains Half a Month's Household Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, at last night's tea party with Peking University professors, responded to the issue of improving treatment by saying: The government has decided to follow the example of Beijing and Shanghai and distribute goods in kind in nine cities. The first to start will be Tianjin and Beiping this month. If there are insufficient materials in Tianjin and Beiping, the difference between the market price will be issued first. Zhu said that of the additional improvement and expansion funds, only six universities nationwide received 2.5 billion, that is, Peking University, Tsinghua, Central, Zhongshan, Zhejiang, and Wuhan. The 18 billion requested by Peking University is truly beyond its means. Hu Shi spoke twice, saying that the call for this kind of cry from Peking University professors is not focused on money, but on hoping to maintain the professors' dedication to their careers. Zhou Binglin said that the current salary can only sustain a family of four for half a month, and the professor's children can no longer afford books. Zhao Naiju urged Zhu to pay attention to the difference in the rate of price increases and salaries.</p>

<h3>The Government Will Adopt a Subsidy System to Rescue the Export Industry Crisis</h3>
<p>Subsidy Measures Under Review by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Since the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market price emerged, the export industry has suffered a severe blow and has fallen into a state of stagnation. To rescue the export industry crisis, the government has adopted a purchasing policy to promote exports. However, the targets of the purchase are limited to seven major commodities, including tung oil, bristles, tea, silk, eggs, and wool. For export commodities other than these seven, the Export Promotion Council has formulated specific measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan is currently reviewing them. It is heard that the principle has been decided to adopt a subsidy system, allowing merchants to export independently. This is because government officials believe that seeking a balance of international payments and encouraging exports are the only important issues at present. Therefore, anyone who can export should be assisted to export in order to earn foreign exchange, which is the biggest goal. For commodities other than the seven major ones, the adoption of subsidy measures is entirely aimed at obtaining foreign exchange. It is generally believed that if this is implemented, China's international trade will have a turning point, and it will be of great help to the balance of international payments.</p>

<h3>Fuel Management Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss Accelerating Coal Transportation</h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee invited the Beijing-Shanghai, Ping-Han, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways, as well as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Municipal Public Works Bureau, to hold a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of accelerating coal transportation. According to the committee, in the past, about 150,000 tons of coal were transported to Shanghai each month, of which about 50,000 tons came from Taiwan and 100,000 tons came from the Kailuan Coal Mine. As of now this month, more than 70,000 tons of coal have been transported to Shanghai. Due to the strengthening of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway transportation, the amount of Kailuan coal transported to Shanghai can be increased to 150,000 tons starting this month. Mr. Sun, director of the Unified Distribution Office of the committee, estimates that the amount of coal distributed in this city this winter can be increased by 20,000 tons per month compared to the current amount, that is, 170,000 tons, so there is no need to worry about the coal shortage. In addition, after the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other places in the Yangtze River region were allowed to purchase coal freely, coal has been continuously transported to Shanghai from various places. Recently, coal merchants in this city transported 20,000 tons of coal from Wuhan to Shanghai, which may be the main reason for the recent sluggish coal prices. In addition, the third batch of civil coal in this city will be distributed by the committee in late this month, and the amount is still 5,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Exports Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>According to relevant sources, all kinds of Chinese export goods are subject to losses when sold abroad. For example, calculated on the basis of bristles, tung oil, and casings, the difference is about 50%, tea is about 100%, and the price difference for raw silk is even greater. Taking this year's spring cocoon yarn cost of about 38.5 million yuan per dan as an example, although there are transactions in foreign sales, the price is very low. For those with five to ten dan or more, each pound is about 5 US dollars. With each dan weighing 133 pounds, converted at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, each dan is only worth more than 7.9 million national currency. For transactions of more than 100 dan, each pound is only worth more than 3 US dollars. On average, calculated at 4 US dollars per pound, each group of raw silk exports must lose at least 600%. This year's spring cocoon loan was 160 billion yuan, the reeling worker loan was 100 billion yuan, plus interest and 10% of the manufacturers' advance, the total amount is about 490 billion yuan. The total silk production is 14,000 bundles, and the cost of each bundle is 38.5 million yuan. Converted at the foreign selling price of 4 US dollars per pound, each dan is only worth more than 6 million yuan. Therefore, the total cost of 490 billion yuan can only recover more than 80 billion yuan at the selling price, and it is not known when it can be sold out. Even in terms of the raw silk purchased by the government last year, only more than 1,000 dan have been shipped to the United States for sale by the China Trust Bureau to date. As for the autumn cocoon loan, the authorities have not yet approved it. If calculated at a silk production of 8,000 dan and a cost of 38.5 million yuan per dan, the total amount of funds required is about 310 billion yuan. Therefore, the total cost of spring and autumn cocoon reeling silk reaches a huge 800 billion yuan. The rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Kunming cities, the spring silk cocoon loans are again flowing into the cities, which is a major factor affecting price increases. Therefore, the authorities are conducting a detailed study of this.</p>
<h3>Before the Executive Yuan's Approval Arrives, Artificial Silk Temporarily Maintains Last Week's List Price, Silk Weaving Industry Petition Representatives Have Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The China Trust Bureau's artificial silk allocation price was passed by the bureau's business executives' meeting yesterday, and it was decided that before the Executive Yuan's approval arrives, the list price of last week will be temporarily maintained. That is, Dongyang Dafugui is 22.4 million yuan, and others such as Tianqiao, Gaoshan, and Jinbenma are still 22.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the silk weaving industry's petition representatives Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and others have returned to Shanghai from Beijing. According to Cai and others, the central authorities have expressed great sympathy for the request to reduce the allocation price of artificial silk and agreed to consider the various items submitted and instructed them to return to Shanghai first to contact the China Trust Bureau. It was originally intended to go to the China Trust Bureau for negotiations yesterday, but because Wu Rencang has not yet returned to Shanghai, it will be changed to Monday. At that time, the two sides will conduct a detailed review, and a solution may be obtained.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Turns Prosperous</p>
<p>It is also reported that the artificial silk market is sluggish, but morale has turned prosperous, and it has risen again in the afternoon.

The official market price was 6.2 million yuan, which was 500,000 yuan higher than the daily price.</p>
<p>Factory Management is Stable</p>
<p>The factory management market was quite stable yesterday morning, but due to the Saturday relationship, the quotes were all 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. High uniformity is still lacking in inquiries, and the transaction price of another dan of goods is the same as the previous day. The eight hearts are more expensive in the afternoon, and the quotes have increased again compared to the morning, but there are no formal transactions. Silk prices fall back</p>
<p>Silk goods and bed covers have been flying high for several days. The market fell back yesterday. Huakang goods were transacted at 490,000 and 500,000 yuan after the market opened, with a five0,000 yuan premium for Monday. Later, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell step by step, and the smallest spot price was 430,000 yuan. After 9 o'clock, it rose again, returning to the original market price at the opening. Finally, due to more selling, it fell again, and the closing price was 450,000 yuan, with a 490,000 yuan premium for Monday, a drop of more than 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dazhen goods were about 100,000 yuan more expensive than Huakang goods. Lattice crepe was quoted at 4,500 yuan, but there was little success.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Weakens</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine was once strong, but due to sluggish sales, customers added allocations, the amounts were small, and they were not in full pieces, which led to a return to weakness. People in the industry felt very depressed, and the market transactions were extremely lonely, a dullness that has not been seen in previous years.</p>
<h3>Market Rumors Abound, Chinese Stocks Weaken and Then Strengthen</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were temporarily weak yesterday. After the North Gang's young and strong factions and the securities gang's active multi-party additions, the situation changed after some effort. The empty side was forced to cover, so rumors abounded, and the stock market emerged, leaving material objects and advancing alone. Except for China Feng Enamel, which was affected by a certain dispute, the special stock panicked and went from bad to worse, falling by more than 15%. The rest of the stocks advanced uniformly, and business even rose to the limit.

Nos. 223, 16, 117, 186, 85, 76, 105, 36, 207, and 158 still had strong buying intentions, and Nos. 163 and 232 also entered the current Yongsha. After 10:30, No. 163, a young and strong faction, made efforts to pull up, and a squeeze was launched.</p>
<p>After 11 o'clock, Yongsha stepped up to 235 yuan and 236 yuan, and Meiya also got the purchase of Nos. 149 and 95 and was also pulled up. No. 130 took advantage of the high price to close, and the current Yongsha Nos. 207 and 186 also sold out, turning lower slightly, but because the morale was already good, rumors of foreign exchange adjustment and free gold buying and selling spread, Nos. 32, 4, 24, 163, 117, 89, and 8 re-entered, and Nos. 163 and 157 bought the current Yongsha. At 11:20, business was pulled up to the limit by No. 157, and Yongsha also rose to a high price of 236 yuan and 240 yuan. Only China Feng had special unfavorable news, and the holders panicked. No. 147 tried to sell the current China Feng, and the downward trend was strengthened instead. Before the close, Nos. 76, 235, 14, 112, 157, and 18 took advantage of the high price to close, falling back to 230 yuan and 232 yuan. No. 163 still included the current Yongsha. The current Yongsha closed at 234 yuan at noon, and the delivery Yongsha closed at 232 yuan, forming an inverted hanging.</p>
<p>The shouting price was stable after the close, but in the afternoon, there were those who jumped to 245 yuan.

<h3>Fan Talk</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Since the Ming Dynasty, those made in Suzhou and Sichuan have been the best. In the autocratic era, the dragon, phoenix, and hundred birds symbolized the monarch</p>
<p>Fans are divided into round fans and folding fans. The name for fans, Guan Yi Dong is called "　", and Guan Yi Xi is called "fan".</p>
<p>Round fans were invented very early, and the era cannot be verified; while folding fans only appeared after the Yuan Dynasty, and their origin came from Goryeo. It was treated as collateral and flowed into China. However, at that time, the name was "Jutou Fan", because it was convenient to hide in the sleeves, it gradually became popular after the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>The fans of the Ming Dynasty were mostly decorated with gold powder, that is, the ones bestowed by the emperor to his ministers, and their faces were also made of gold. It was not until after Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty that calligraphy and painting were done on the fan surface. If sellers of ancient calligraphy and paintings today use fan-shaped folding pages to falsely claim that they are works by famous public figures in the early Ming Dynasty and wait for the price to sell, then they are definitely fake products. Fortunately, buyers should not be fooled.</p>
<p>Since then, those made in Suzhou and Sichuan have been the best. In the autocratic era, the dragon, phoenix, and hundred birds symbolized the monarch and empress, so the fans used in the palace at that time had their bones and faces decorated with Zhenglong, Cenlong, Hundred Dragons, or Hundred Birds, which were very brilliant and spectacular. However, the price was also extremely expensive, with one handle worth several gold. Some people even became famous for making fans, such as Ma Xun, Ma Fu, Shen Shaolou, and Jiang Sutai, who were mostly praised as famous masters in the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, the ones contributed from various places that were appreciated by the Emperor included the Jinling Yangshi fan and the Yishi plain paper fan; then there were the Qingyang fan, the Wuling gauze fan, and the Cao Miao, 靴鼠, and Liyang opera fan. Now that we have reached the present day, round fans made of banana leaves are still popular with ordinary laborers. Although folding fans are beautiful, "benevolent wind fans are raised", after all, round fans are more practical.</p>
<p>The ancients often painted beautiful women with fans in their paintings, which shows that there is also an indissoluble bond between fans and beauties. Those who use fans in poetry have the sentence "light silk small fan flicks fireflies", which is very beautifully depicted. However, "autumn fan is abandoned" refers to the aging of beauty.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Fans and Women</h3>
<p>— Donglai</p>
<p>Friends who have read Wang Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan" and Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan" and other plays will understand even more the influence and significance of fans on women.</p>
<p>In fact, as early as the Han Dynasty, there was Ban Jieyu's poem about round fans, the so-called "discarded in the basket, love is cut off in the middle", which has long become the story of the abandoned autumn fan in later generations. During the Jin Dynasty, there was also a Wang Min who often held a white round fan to cover his shame because he had an affair with his sister-in-law's maidservant. The maidservant gave him a white round fan and sang: "Round fan, round fan, allow me to hold it to cover my face. Haggard and no longer groomed, ashamed to meet my lover." Fans have the wonderful use of covering shame in addition to fanning the wind, no wonder shy women like to carry fans with them; and the various roles of 生旦净丑 on the stage have various different fans to help them pose.</p>
<p>The most romantic stories about fans and women, there is a story about a gold-painted fan in my hometown, passed down by word of mouth. At the end of the former Qing Dynasty, a wealthy official married several concubines, some from Suzhou, some from Yangzhou, and some from Beijing. The concubine from Beijing fell in love with an actor and secretly gave the master's most beloved gold-painted antique folding fan to the actor as a souvenir. Later, unfortunately, the master saw the fan in the actor's hand, and asked the Beijing concubine to take it, because this precious antique had always been kept by her. Under such interrogation, the adultery was naturally revealed. The master was enlightened and sent the concubine to the actor in a sedan chair overnight, ordering the two to leave the country together, and naturally the gold-painted fan was also given to them as a token of love. Afterwards, this generous master still had a poem, and I remember the last two sentences:</p>
<p>"Riding the wind to send you away with the person, I am willing to donate the gold-painted fan together."</p>
<p>This master is good at describing himself, regarding women as the same as fans, casually giving them away. In ancient times, there was a strange custom of giving concubines and maids. This master is truly "古道可风"</p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary people, fans are different from women after all. Fans can be given away, but women cannot, because women have their own personality, they are not just a gift!</p>
<p>But one person cannot use two fans to fan the wind at the same time. Similarly, one person should not marry two wives in one room at the same time. If you use or marry one more, someone will use one less or remain a widower for life, which is not the case.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I often used two fans to fan the wind to cool off, and my grandmother immediately forbade it, saying that it could not be fanned like this. When asked what the reason was, she refused to say. Later, I heard others tell me that this is a superstition, saying that if you use two fans to fan the wind at the same time, you will turn into a butterfly after death.</p>
<p>Although it is absurd, it is quite close to the taste of literature and art.</p>
<h3>Talking About Fans</h3>
<p>— Fengren</p>
<p>There are many poems about fans in ancient times, and the autumn wind round fan is still well-known. Later, doers</p>
<h3>Wind Butterfly Order</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Fan</p>
<p>The heat makes it a necessity, but it's discarded and hidden when it's cold.  Isn't blocking half the face a novel look? A marvelous sight on the airfield: a new bride evading!</p>
<p>Electricity provides head-shaking rotations, while slight breezes require manual effort. Born in the same era, yet the coolness differs. Who cares about swatting flies and mosquitoes while sweat pours like syrup!  Such endeavors emerge in succession, with Chen Yunbo, a poet from Qiantang, gaining fame for his "Round Fan Poems." However, the earliest odes to fans were expressions of sentiment through objects, with writing born from emotion, hence their profound impact. Later works merely piled up words and phrases, lacking substance, at best a small decoration for so-called "men of letters" to amuse themselves.</p>
<p>Round fans often feature ornaments like fan pendants, usually carved from jade into various figures and playthings. Wang Yiwen's poem on Emperor Gaozong of Song says, "A thousand gold spent on a jade child." The jade child refers to the fan pendant. According to "West Lake Miscellaneous Records," "Emperor Gaozong once hosted a banquet for his ministers and saw Zhang Xunwang Jun holding a fan with a jade child pendant. The emperor recognized it as an old item, accidentally dropped into the water in Siming in the past. He asked Jun where he obtained it, and Jun replied, 'I bought it from a shop in Qinghefang.' Inquiring with the shopkeeper, he said he got it from a basket carrier. Further inquiry revealed it came from a kitchen maid in the Chen residence outside Houchaomen. The maid said she found it in the belly of a broken yellow croaker. The emperor was overjoyed. The shopkeeper and basket carrier were promoted to junior officers, and the kitchen maid was granted the title of 'Madam.'" This story is truly amusing. Emperor Gaozong thought the return of the old object was a good omen and treated the shopkeeper, basket carrier, and kitchen maid as meritorious officials who had recovered lost territory and restored the homeland, bestowing generous rewards. In reality, besides giving these peddlers a windfall, it had no other significance. If Emperor Gaozong had valued Yue Wu Mu and Han Shizhong as much as the basket carrier and kitchen maid, the return of old objects would have been more than just a jade child.</p>
<p>The abandonment of fans with the arrival of autumn has been a source of sorrow throughout history. However, Zhong Tui'gu's inscription on a fan box states, "Store this woman, let her rest. She says she is discarded. I say the bird sees the man, earnestly embracing him in his sleeve, able to live out his days." Thus, "the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away," is actually a blessing for the good bow. In fact, round fans have almost disappeared today, not even waiting for the autumn wind. The currently popular folding fans, commonly known as oil paper fans, can be opened and closed freely, making them convenient to carry. Lu Shen's "Random Notes from the Spring Breeze Cottage" states, "Today's folding fans, Zhang Donghai believed, benefited the Eastern barbarians, and became popular in China during the Yongle reign." The "Peng Chuang Continued Records" states the same. However, folding fans did not originate in the Ming Dynasty. Records show that they were already in use during the Southern Song Dynasty. Su Dongpo mentioned Korean white pine fans that could be unfolded to over a foot wide and folded to only two fingers, which are folding fans. Feng Fang said, "My family has a folding fan with a poem by Emperor Zhangzong of Jin," which says, "Several strands of Xiang River dragon bones are slender, cleverly designed and folded into Xiang River wrinkles." This suggests that they existed during the Song and Jin Dynasties, and became popular during the Yongle reign.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Zhoujia Bridge was one of the main production areas for folding fans, with eighty or ninety percent of the villagers making a living from it. The manufacturing process was highly specialized, with pay varying according to the nature of the work, but generally very low. The quality of the fans was roughly divided into several grades, with inferior ones costing a thousand or two, and superior ones costing over ten thousand. Before the war, they were sold overseas, earning huge sums of money. After the war, affected by prices, they gradually declined. The surfaces of folding fans were decorated with paintings or calligraphy. "Hangzhou Customs and Remnants" records female workers who pasted fan surfaces, saying, "The oil paper fans sent to Shandong and the northern provinces have colored paintings of figures on one side and cut-out gold characters pasted on the other. The pasting of characters is also done by female workers. Fan shops such as Shu Lian Ji and Zhang Ziyuan all distribute this work, starting around August or September. Although there is some work at other times, it is not much. The price is also relatively low, only a few coins per fan." This shows that gold leaf fans were once popular, but are no longer seen today.</p>
<p>Today, electric fans roar in the cities, and paper fans have little use. In the past, Fan Fanshan wrote poems about steamships, trains, telegraphs, and photographs, vividly and colorfully. It's a pity he didn't write about electric fans, perhaps because they weren't very popular at that time.</p>

<h3>Chats on Painting Fans</h3>
<p>— Hu Yaguang</p>
<p>The art of painting fans also has its secrets, which should not be overlooked. Beginners often find it difficult, mainly because they are not familiar with the secrets. Now I will try to describe a few, for the reference of scholars, and as a conversation piece during tea breaks. I will write in a rambling way, hoping that those with more experience will not laugh at my shallowness, then I will be very lucky.</p>
<p>(1) Removing Oil: Fan surfaces often have oil stains. If the artist does not notice, the ink will not adhere easily to the oily spots, which is not elegant. There are many old methods. One is to use a small tube made of lampwick (the firmer the better), and gently wipe the area before applying ink. The oil stains will be completely removed, and the artist can paint freely. Alternatively, use clean hair, or a wad of flannel, or cloth-wrapped talc powder, or cuttlefish powder. Wiping with these is also effective. Later, tooth powder was used, which is more convenient. However, if one is not careful, the oil may be removed, but the powder will remain on the surface, which will be counterproductive. This is because ink mixed with powder will turn gray, so one must be careful. The simplest method, which can be done anytime, anywhere, is to use straw paper or maolu paper, etc. Any domestic paper with cotton fiber will clean the surface with a single wipe, without the need for powder.</p>
<p>(2) Flattening: Once the oil stains are removed and one is ready to paint, the fan board is the most important tool. The most common type is rectangular, with three spiral screws that can be adjusted to any size. This is the most suitable. If you find it too expensive, you can make your own. Take a piece of plywood and, according to the size of the fan surface, draw a fan shape, or slightly larger on all sides. Then, using a copper wire saw, cut off the four corners according to the pattern. Purchase three steel paper clips, the tighter the better. Choose those with stronger springs. In this way, a simple fan board is made. Thick cardboard can also be used to make your own. If you are in a hurry and cannot find a fan board, there are two very simple methods that can be used. One is to fold the fan surface along the creases in reverse, which can also flatten it. The other is to use an electric iron to iron it. These two methods are only used in emergencies and are not ideal.</p>
<p>(3) Hand Rest: When painting in summer, there will inevitably be sweat on the wrist. When putting the brush down, it is best to place a thin cloth on the right side of the fan surface to rest your hand, so that there will be no sweat stains when moving from left to right or from right to left.</p>
<p>(4) Corrections: If there is an occasional mistake, or if the inscription is incorrect, do not scribble or wipe it randomly, as this will damage the fan surface and make it impossible to remedy. There is a wonderful method: take high-quality cigarette ash (cigar ash is even better), dip it with a clean brush, and apply a small amount to the mistake. Then, dip it with clean water and gently let it flow, and it will be removed, leaving no trace and being very convenient. However, do not use too much force, and it is best not to damage the alum on the surface, otherwise, if the alum is removed, the use of ink and color will leave traces and damage the fan surface.</p>
<p>(5) Seals: If a seal is accidentally stamped upside down, or if the fan surface is stained with ink paste, you can gently wipe it off with a soft white eraser. After stamping the seal, when folding the fan, the fingers may rub against it, causing it to blur easily. You can mix cinnabar powder with Ming glue and apply it evenly. This will make the color bright and beautiful and prevent it from blurring easily.</p>
<p>(6) Leaks: When painting rainy landscapes or large-scale splashed ink flowers, etc., one often becomes very excited and disregards everything, seeking momentary gratification. But after the ink dries, one discovers that it has penetrated the back of the paper. What will you do at this point? If the back has not been written on, people will not want to write on it. If it has already been written on, wouldn't it be soiling someone else's calligraphy? This would be embarrassing for the other person and put yourself in an awkward situation. This is what is meant by being bold when putting down the brush but careful when cleaning up. After putting down the brush, if you see a large amount of ink accumulating in the creases of the fan surface, quickly absorb it with a dry brush to prevent problems. This is because the back is often stained because the alum on the surface has been soaked for too long, and the fan surface has become leaky and defenseless, so the water will naturally seep to the back. This point is also unavoidable, and beginners must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(7) Composition: The composition of flowers, etc., on a fan surface is no different from other framed paintings. However, for landscapes and figures or birds used as secondary elements, one must be careful. This is because the fan surface is semi-circular, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. If you paint landscapes or secondary elements according to the semi-circular shape, adding them gradually from left to right, you will unknowingly make a big mistake by the time the entire painting is finished. This is because the distant mountains, the near slopes, and the horizon will all be curved, which is ridiculous. Beginners often make this mistake. In short, before painting, do not regard it as a fan surface, but as a framed painting. The fan surface is just a framed painting cut into a fan shape. You must start with the overall composition, and you will never go wrong, and you can paint freely. However, inscriptions are different. You cannot regard them as writing straight across a framed painting. If you write straight, you must write according to the slope of the folds, which is larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, to be aesthetically pleasing. If you write horizontally, you must write according to the arc of the edge, to be aesthetically pleasing and appropriate. Although this is a small detail, it is of great importance.</p>
<h3>Ode to a Broken Fan</h3>
<p>— Zhou Kun</p>
<p>The summer heat lingers, the scorching sun blazes, sweat flows down the back, and qi stagnates. What is most valued on such a day? This fan, of course! The craftsman displays his skill, focusing on the paper. Bamboo is used to make the frame, and images are created to convey meaning. When the corner moves, the breeze dispels the heat, allowing one to calm the mind and spend the day peacefully. But when the fan breaks, it can no longer block the heat or produce wind, and one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy. I once read Xu Ni's poem on a broken fan, which says, "It cannot block the sun completely, and the wind it creates is only half as cool. It is not like Peng Qiao's smile, but it still stirs the fragrance of clothes." Ma Shi's poem on a broken fan says, "Who painted the girl riding an oriole in the moon? Purple bamboo and silver silk hold up white silk. It has not yet come to autumn, but the light is already broken. It must have been exposed to too much wind before." After reading these, I sighed deeply. The people are close to the suffering of boiling water and scorching stones, unable to escape. Who will present a letter of introduction and take hold of the fan, swaying it gently to create a breeze everywhere? Looking to the left, one feels cool; looking to the right, one feels cool. Abandoning worries is like being in an ice room, and everyone will happily express their gratitude, saying, "The people of the scorched earth have been relieved of their distress, all thanks to you!"</p>

<h3>Ode to the Fan</h3>

<p>Tune: Butterfly Loves Flowers</p>
<p>Drawing in coolness and serving as a convenient screen; its elegant reputation has been passed down through the ages. It forms a connection difficult to unravel, often providing convenience in leisure.</p>
<p>Flattery and bragging cheapen its value. Welcoming summer and discarding spring (winter), it happily embraces the fiery heat. Don't say that ice mountains can be relied on for long; its fate still follows the swallows on carved beams.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Collecting Fans</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaocang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the painting and calligraphy on fans should be emphasized when collecting them. However, rubbings of inscriptions on bronze and stone, brick patterns, and Buddhist images are also interesting.</p>
<p>The beauty of the fan bones is also appreciated by fan collectors. There are water-polished bamboo, carved bamboo, mottled bamboo, plum bamboo, mottled bamboo, rosewood, ebony, sandalwood, plain bamboo, tortoiseshell, ivory chicken wings, and various lacquer bones. However, old ones are valued more. People in Jiangnan do not value the fan support at the bottom of the fan bones. Therefore, the Rongbaozhai and Qingbiget in the capital often have specialized fan support makers (named Chen Zihe, the best craftsman in the capital) make mouse supports from tortoiseshell and other materials, which are sturdy and not easily damaged. Shanghai fan shops have recently been producing fan surfaces and fan bones crudely and carelessly. Who still cares about the fan support? It is regrettable to talk about this.</p>
<p>In the past, fan surfaces valued gold leaf. The Ming Dynasty fan pages in my collection have bright red gold that is dazzling and lovely. In the past, I have collected many fan surface albums and pages, and I always prefer old gold leaf fans. In the past, there were still commodity fan surfaces available. The inner layer of the fan surface was printed with the words "Respectfully made by a certain governor of Zhejiang," and its quality was not comparable to today's ordinary fan surfaces.</p>
<p>Calligraphers and painters often regard writing or painting on fan bones as a long and difficult task, because the fan bones are slightly uneven, unlike paper, which can be spread out flat and painted on at will. Therefore, a certain bamboo carver in the capital first photographs the calligraphy and painting of famous artists, then makes a printing plate, and then applies a kind of chemical to the printing plate. The chemical changes can be used to reprint the calligraphy and painting onto the fan bones, without any distortion from the original calligraphy and painting. He then engages in carving, which is more splendid than the few strokes casually made by calligraphers and painters on fan bones. This is also a method that bamboo carvers should learn from.</p>

<h3>Lecture at the 37th Literary Tea Party: Methods of Sketching in Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Yu Jianhua, recorded by Ruo Qu</p>
<p>Painting is essentially a visual art, so it must draw from nature. To draw from nature, one must sketch. Therefore, regardless of the differences between Chinese and Western painting methods, sketching is the starting point for both. Chinese painting in the Tang and Song dynasties was all about sketching. Historical records confirm this. Wu Daozi wanted to capture the entirety of the Jialing River landscape, so he traveled to the Jialing River by boat. Wang Wei lived in Lan Chuan and painted the Lan Chuan landscape. Jing Hao and Guan Tong painted the northern landscape, Dong Yuan and Ju Ran painted the southern landscape, Mi Fu painted the southern Xu landscape, and Ma Yuan and Xia Gui painted the eastern Zhejiang landscape. Horse painters took hundreds of thousands of horses as their teachers, and cattle painters could paint the reflection of a herdsboy in the cow's eyes. Flower painters went to the steps in front of the house to describe the shapes of flowers swaying in the wind and glistening with dew, with buds ready to burst. Figure painters not only captured the appearance of people, but also conveyed their spirit and temperament.</p>
<p>The trend of sketching in Chinese painting gradually changed in the Yuan Dynasty. Although Huang Gongwang also painted the Fuchun Mountains and Wang Meng also painted the Tiaoxi Mountains, due to the development of literati painting, painters focused on brushwork and ink interest, transcendence and charm, and neglected the basic work of sketching. At the same time, because there were more and more paintings in the world, it was much easier for painters to paint based on paintings than to paint based on nature. It is human nature to love ease and hate labor. Therefore, copying ancient paintings became popular in the art world, and no one paid attention to sketching from life. This trend became extremely popular in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Painters only knew about the ancients and did not know about nature. The trend of copying became more and more prevalent, and the art of painting declined more and more. Paintings became nothing more than repetitive, monotonous, and lifeless reproductions. Without sketching and without creation, some modern people have said that there was no theory of painting for three hundred years in the Qing Dynasty. It is not that there was no painting in the Qing Dynasty, but that there were no truly creative and lively paintings. Ninety-nine percent of all paintings were either "a disciple copying a teacher" or a teacher copying the ancients.</p>
<p>After five or six hundred years of the Ming and Qing dynasties, painters only studied methods of copying and no one was willing to learn methods of sketching. By now, methods of sketching have long been lost. Therefore, if we want to study methods of sketching in Chinese painting, we are at a loss as to where to start. Fortunately, modern Western painting has been introduced, and we can first learn Western sketching methods as a foundation and then move on to sketching in Chinese painting. This is because the methods of sketching in Western and Chinese painting are fundamentally different. Western painting methods are easier than Chinese painting methods, so we can borrow them first.</p>
<p>Sketching in Western painting requires a fixed point of view. The painter's viewpoint and horizon must be at a certain height, and the painter must be at a certain distance from the natural object. One cannot look left and right, nor can one move forward and backward. One must also be limited by time and light. A scene sketched in Western painting at nine o'clock in the morning can only be painted until ten o'clock. By noon, the sunlight has completely changed, and one must start a new painting. Therefore, Western painting must either be done outdoors or in a studio with artificial light. Therefore, it is said that Western painting is fixed and analytical, strictly limited by perspective, and a concrete and temporary phenomenon in which natural objects are reflected in the eye and reflected on the drawing surface. After learning this method, one can then apply it to sketching in Chinese painting, because Chinese painting is not limited by time, light, or perspective. The painter also does not have a fixed point of view, and there is not necessarily a horizon on the painting. For example, to paint Mount Huang, the painter walks from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, from the back of the mountain to the left and right sides of the mountain, and integrates the entire shape of Mount Huang in the chest, omitting its trivial details and taking its essence. Then, back at home, the painter expresses the impression in the chest on paper. Therefore, one painting (such as my painting Huangshan Grand View) can be painted from Tianmenkan to Tiandu Lianhua, and from Wenshu Monastery to Lion Grove. This is the strength of sketching in Chinese painting, which Western painting cannot do. Therefore, sketching in Chinese painting is a holistic, permanent, and comprehensive impression. Saying it is painting Mount Huang, but it is not a realistic representation of Mount Huang, with every tree, every rock, and every mountain looking like a photograph. Saying it is not Mount Huang, but those who have been to Mount Huang can recognize Tiandu, Lianhua, Wenshu, and Lion Grove at a glance. This method of being both close and distant, neither identical nor dissimilar, extracting the essence and taking the spirit, is the strength of Chinese painting, and it is what makes art art. However, this method cannot be achieved overnight. It requires traveling thousands of miles, seeing all the famous mountains and rivers in the world, accumulating twenty or thirty years of technical practice, and then combining it with the brush and ink methods of the ancients, seasoned with the erudition of reading thousands of books, before there is hope of success. Although I have aspirations in this regard, my gains are still shallow. I hope that experts will not hesitate to give me advice.</p>

<h3>A Record of the "All Under Heaven is at Peace" Broken Tile</h3>
<p>— Zhong Gongpei</p>
<p>The creation of tiles originated very early. With the rise of the construction of palaces and houses, the need for and invention of tiles arose in response to the times. Later, due to the development of culture, there was a demand for beauty and aesthetic pleasure in addition to daily use. Thus, the system of ornamentation arose. Simple and rustic patterns, designs, or words were applied to the tiles to enhance them. Although there were creations in every era, the Qin and Han dynasties are considered the most prosperous, and the Warring States and Han dynasties are considered the most refined. When we look at the simple, vigorous, and powerful characters and the elegant, rustic designs on the tile ends of the Qin and Han dynasties, we cannot help but feel a deep affection for them. No wonder their fame resonates throughout ancient and modern times, and broken bricks and broken tiles are regarded as treasures by antique collectors.</p>
<p>The earliest record of tile ends is found in Wang Guan's "Yan Shui Yan Tan Lu" of the Song Dynasty (which records the discovery of Qin Wugong's Yuyang Palace tiles by a commoner named Quan in Baoji County in the sixth year of the Song Yuan Dynasty, which was the beginning of the attention paid to the excavation of tile ends). Over the centuries, secret treasures have been unearthed day by day. Those who were once buried in the wilderness and dust are now classified as a type of metal and stone and have entered the realm of art and archaeology.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 7th of this year, I went to Zhongshan Park for a walk and found several broken tile ends among the rubble on the foothills of the mountain behind the National Art College. I brought them back to clean them up. The next day I went back to search and found several more in the accumulated soil near the area. Although the objects were broken, their style and pattern were quite ancient. Among them, the "All Under Heaven is at Peace" tile (see picture) was the most unique. I made a special study of it, which I believe scholars of this field will also be happy to discuss.</p>
<p>Upon close examination, the tile is made of fine soil, and the color is slightly bluish-white. The fire has been completely removed, which is probably due to being buried in the soil for a long time. Its shape is slightly rounded, which is commonly known as a flying eaves tile, or what was called a half-tile in the Han Dynasty. The tile has two sizes: the larger one is about 12 cm long and 18 cm wide and 2 cm thick, and the smaller one is about 10 cm long, 17 cm wide and 1 cm thick. In the center of the tile is engraved a strange head resembling a pixiu, ferocious and terrifying, rustic and quite spirited, which is very similar to the engraving on the Liang Tongtai Temple tile end unearthed in Nanjing before the war. Below it are three wavy curves extending from one end of the tile to the other. In the two corners on the left and right of the head are engraved the four characters "All Under Heaven is at Peace" in regular script. The characters are quite simple and vigorous. Either the characters "All Under Heaven" are on the left, or the characters "is at Peace" are on the left, and their sizes are also different, which is probably due to being produced by several patterns. Furthermore, comparing the characters and soil quality of this tile with those of the Leifeng Pagoda tile, there are many similarities, so it is probably an object from the Five Dynasties period. After surveying the land, it is located behind the Zhaodan Platform (the former site of the Zhuangdan Platform of the current Art College), which is the former site of the Agate Slope mentioned in the Song Dynasty. Furthermore, according to the "Lake and Mountain Handbook" Volume 2: "The Agate Baosheng Fire Prevention Wall, built by Qian of Wuyue during the Three Qi of the Jin Dynasty, rebuilt by monk Xiyuan during the Xiangfu reign of the Song Dynasty ...; in Shaoxing, the Xiangguan was moved to Geling, and the Zhaogong Pavilion was built at the site in the Ming Dynasty." It can be seen that the site was originally the site of the Agate Baosheng Temple. Furthermore, after examining the annals of Wu Yue, since King Wusu used the Tang calendar at the end of his reign, and after Tang Dynasty perished, and Jin Shijingtang stole the country, the annual stone carvings and other records often did not record the state name, only the year and month. This was because they had already recognized the Central Plains calendar, but avoided mentioning the state name. The "All Under Heaven is at Peace" tile is very likely to be an artifact of the Baosheng Temple. The text "All Under Heaven is at Peace" actually has the meaning of fearing to decorate the Wu Yue era.</p>
<p>There are many other broken tiles, all of which are engraved with elegant patterns, or in the shape of swirling clouds, or in the shape of water waves, or in the shape of double-curved quadripole, all different. Among them, the sunflower relief is the most outstanding and is also likely to be an object from the same period. In addition, there are still many three-colored (yellow, green, black) glazed tiles from the Qing Dynasty Shengyin Temple and tile ends left over from the Ming and Qing dynasties. These will be introduced in another article. I will not elaborate on them here. (Recorded in July at Wenlan Pass in West Lake)</p>
<h3>"Awkward"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Zi Ti's farewell poem asks about illness: "Actions and hiding are both awkward, returning to the wind and waves." Han Yu's Qughe Station poem: "Relatives suddenly become awkward, diagrams and history are abandoned." Luo Yin's poem Burning Books and Burying Scholars: "The First Emperor's calculations were all awkward, thinking that poetry and books could save people." The two characters "awkward" were used by Yu Xin in his poem: "The turban has long been awkward, the chrysanthemum path has been briefly passed." It is said that "awkward" is similar to "eccentric," which is a colloquialism.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 379</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You, uh..." Yaoqun pondered slightly; "You know, we came from inside the pass, and this journey was already difficult enough; who knew things would change in such a fresh way again; it's not worth it if we've already traveled nine and a half stages out of ten, and then something else comes up when we get to the old stronghold! ... What should we do..."</p>
<p>"Good, you, uh,... Tong the host understands what Yaoqun intends, "Only then did he relax the pair of furrowed, thick eyebrows:" After all, you are the educated one. Whatever you say, that's what I'll do."</p>
<p>"Don't rush, just send two experienced "Zhao Zi" (scouts) ahead for a stage, both to notify our hidden sentries along the way to be vigilant, and to check if the road is clear; if it's clear, they can go all the way to the old stronghold; notify the stations along the way to prepare horses; in case the road isn't so clear, have them send one person back as quickly as possible to warn us, so we can prepare. We here will still follow your plan, and set off at exactly twelve o'clock... (Zhao Zi means scout, the name for reconnaissance in the Baozhong Bureau, bandits call the same job 'Panzi'.)</p>
<p>"Truly capable, you are!" Tong the host raised a hand and gave a thumbs up: ""Caution is never wrong," that's what's admirable!..."</p>
<p>"You know," Yaoqun continued: "Neither Tiger Brother nor I are afraid of trouble. However, this time is a bit special, the matter is too important, we must be careful, ...... Moreover, we don't want to cause trouble for the old stronghold..." (370)</p>
<p>At midnight, twelve o'clock, everything was arranged properly, and the two boarded the car and set off. In less than ten minutes, the car was already on the highway, so it increased speed and drove like the wind. Along this highway, the old stronghold had originally set up many hidden sentries and five small stations, each station living in a different location, but all connected to the old stronghold. The first, second, third, and fifth stations were farther away, and the most rugged and difficult to travel. The fourth station was the shortest, and the road was the flattest. Because it was easy to travel, the people of the old stronghold didn't often use it, except for urgent matters; for fear of attracting attention.</p>
<p>This time, Yaoqun's journey was taking a steady approach; so he planned to take the fourth station; one, to save some time; and two, it had been many days since he had personally driven the reins, and he had pampered himself. Moreover, the livestock and horses of the old stronghold were all spirited and fierce dragons, not easy to control, and if the journey was too rugged, it would be dangerous. However, although the plan was set, it also depended on the movements of the two scout ahead, to see what they found along the way, before a final decision could be made.</p>
<p>The car drove to the first small station, and the several hidden sentries passed along the way all gave the "safe" signal. Although the station wasn't far away, a sentry line rode up on horseback, saw the signal emitted by the car lights, turned the horse around, followed beside the car, and delivered the message, knowing that the two scouts ahead were doing things smartly; as soon as they arrived at the station, they ordered horses to be prepared for Yaoqun and Tiger, and also sent a subordinate from the small station to travel the first station's route, to scout the way ahead; after giving the orders, they went to scout the second station. Yaoqun heard this, saw that the scouts were so thorough, and was extremely satisfied, so he ordered the car to go to the second station.</p>

<h3>Inquiries from Readers: Making a Living Away from Home Year-Round; Child Bride Elopes with Someone; The Evil Consequences of the Old Marriage System</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am from a rural village in Tang Township, and farming is my occupation. When I was eleven years old, my father, out of love for his son, arranged a child bride to come to our home. At that time, the girl was only six years old. When I turned sixteen, I went out to study, and except for returning home for the New Year, I was away all year round. Now, she has reached adulthood and can get along with my family peacefully, without any misbehavior. Because of economic pressure, I was unable to get married. This spring, I received a letter from home informing me that she had run away with someone, taking belongings with her. Initially, there was no news, but recently I learned that she is living with someone. The rural culture is closed, and this is considered a great disgrace. She was raised by my family since she was a child. If there was discord between us, we could have terminated the arrangement. Why resort to such measures? I now have several questions and would like to ask for your answers: (1) What crime has the child bride committed by running away with belongings? (2) If pursuing her in another county, is it necessary to handle the matter in that county? (3) If she repents and returns, can we refuse to accept her? (4) If it is not clear that she has a new love, but she is already living with someone, can we sue that person for seduction? (5) In addition to recovering the stolen items, can we demand compensation for all past living expenses?</p>

<p>[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Ma Fan] (1) Running away with belongings can be prosecuted for theft. (2) If fleeing to another county, you can prosecute in that county. (3) Since the two parties are not formally married and do not have the status of husband and wife, whether to accept her if she repents in the future is up to you. (4) If the child bride is a minor and elopes to live with someone, her guardian can sue the cohabitant for interference with the family. (5) Stolen items can be recovered according to the law, but all past living expenses cannot be claimed.</p>

<h3>Postal Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>This bureau has received inquiries from (1) Xu Yuemei of Zhenru Cotton Farm, (2) Chen Guochang of Wuding Road, (3) Xu Yuhang of Linsen Middle Road, (4) Bu Jiening, (5) Yu Zhenmin of Nantong, (6) Jiang Ying of Yimiao. We now provide brief answers to the points raised: (Answer) (1) (A) Part of the Shanghai suburbs is included in the postal district, with deliveries made by the outer suburban branch. Other areas are delivered by inland bureaus. (B) Zhenru has an inland post office and is not within the Shanghai delivery area.</p>
<p>(2) (A) When remitting money to Chaoyang, Shantou, the maximum amount per person per transaction is 1,000,000 yuan, and the remittance fee is 10 cents per yuan. (B) Sending small packages to Chaoyang costs 9,000 yuan per kilogram. If the ship schedule can be accurately matched, it will take about five to six days to arrive. After arrival, the recipient will be notified to pick up the package at the post office.</p>
<p>(3) (A) Sending small packages to Jiande costs 879 yuan per hundred cubic centimeters. (B) Postcards are available for sale at all post offices. Self-made postcards of the same style, with postage stamps affixed, are also acceptable. (C) In addition to the three scheduled deliveries, this bureau has added an extra delivery at 6:00 PM to expedite local mail delivery. This applies to all types of mail deposited in designated post offices and local express mailboxes before 3:00 PM. (D) This bureau originally planned to set up a post office kiosk on the circular open space at the intersection of Xizang Middle Road and Guangdong Road. After contacting the Public Works Bureau, permission was not granted, so it was relocated to Jinling East Road, south of Xichang Road. Although that location is close to the Jinling East Road branch, that branch is too crowded. The public has repeatedly written to request improvements and to set up a post office kiosk nearby to alleviate the congestion.</p>
<p>(4) The mail collection times at post offices across the country depend on the transportation situation and are not uniform.</p>
<p>(5) (A) Airmail to all provinces from Zhaowan can be forwarded by Taipei. (B) Airmail to Taipei takes one to two days, with an additional one to two days for forwarding to other parts of Taiwan Province. (C) Surface mail takes approximately three to six days if the ship schedule can be accurately matched, with an additional one to two days for forwarding to other locations.</p>
<p>(6) (A) If you have not received a response to a registered letter sent to Guanqiao, Teng County, please bring the original receipt to the original post office to issue an inquiry form for investigation. (B) This bureau has a mailbox at Guanyin Pavilion on Fuyou Road and a stamp sales point at the Yuanyuan Business Hall at 306 Fuyou Road, which is very close to the former Xiaoshijie location. There is also the Shujin Road Postal Branch at the southern end of Yimiao. Businesses that are willing to provide postal services and sell stamps on behalf of the post office can submit a letter of application. If, after investigation, it is deemed necessary, they will be appointed. For details, please contact the Inspection Office of this bureau.</p>
