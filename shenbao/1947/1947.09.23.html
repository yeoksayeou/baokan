<h3>聯大指導委會通過　朝鮮問題列入議程　我代表團闡述贊成美國建議理由　但保留對韓國獨立主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿一日電〕聯合國指導委會今以十二票對二票，通過建議大會討論美國所提之朝鮮獨立問題。蘇聯與波籣投反對票。蘇代表葛羅米柯辭責大部份委員之意見，指査馬歇爾在十七日之大會演辭中「錯誤及歪曲」報道朝鮮之情勢，並稱，根據一九四五年十二月十九四强莫斯科協定，朝鮮問題應由蘇，美，中，英談判解決。美國將該問題提交聯合國大會，係造反其與其他三强之協定，故此事爲「不合法」。美代表奧斯汀答謂，依據聯合國憲章第十四條，聯合國大會能就有關谷國一般幸福之任何問題，提任何建議，是以美國之提出此問題，純在惡軍之明文與精神範疇之內。奧氏指出朝鮮問題之所以遭受磨折，係由於四强未能獲致協識。渠謂在此種情勢下，捨向大會提出討論外，試問尙有他途乎」？</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕列席聯合國大會朝鮮觀察團今日發表聲明，批評蘇聯反對美國提請大會討論朝鮮問題一事稱，茲據各種情報，朝鮮北部現已淪爲共黨軍事基地，充滿朝鮮共軍，中國八路軍及前綫蘇軍。朝鮮南部美佔領軍數字雖見减少，計僅三萬，但北部蘇軍反而增加，共達三十萬人之請。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿一日電〕中國代表願維鈞今日在聯合國指導委員會中正式宣布：中國同意美國之建議，將韓國獨立問題，列入本屆聯大議程，並聲述中國立場：「中國代表團同意將美國有關韓國獨立之建議，列入本屆聯大議程。但吾人仍希望對中國之立場加以說明。依據開羅協定（蘇聯其後在波茨坦亦予以同意），四大國均保證恢復韓國之獨立。一九四五年十二月英，美，蘇之莫斯科協定（中國亦在事後同意），亦規定四國應商洽協議，以設立韓國之臨時政府及早日建立自由獨立之韓國。在四强簽訂新協定更改或事實上近似更改上述兩協定前，四國仍應受此兩協定所規定義務之束縛。將韓國問題列入聯大議程，並不影響四國根據上述協定之地位。韓國之將來對中國之關係至大至深，故吾人虔誠希望，各國應儘量努力，以加速韓國之取得自由及獨立，並在聯合國家中佔應有之一席地。中國代表團亦希望聲明，吾人之說明限於叙述吾人支持美國建議之理由，日後論及有關此問題之贊時，吾人將在這當時候詳述吾人之主張。」</p>
<h3>通過設立五十五國長會</h3>
<p>〔路透社組約弗學辛草地廿一日電〕聯合國大會之指導委員會，今日以十四票對兩票，通過將馬歇爾國務卿所提設立五十五國常務委員會一案，列入本屆聯大議程，反對者僅蘇聯，波蘭兩國。辯論時，中國王世杰外長雖支特將該案列入議程，但聲明保留中國在辯論該計劃利弊時之態度。蘇代表葛羅米柯一貫其反對態度，斥此計劃與聯合國機構之基本原則相牴觸。該一常務委會之職權與安理會平行，實爲非法而不合憲章之組織，密章一度被人破壊，將引起極危險的習慣，使憲章將不復爲人尊重，對於聯合國機構實有損無益。美代表奧斯汀駁斥葛羅米柯所稱該案不合法之說。指出該案匪特完全合法，且可使憲章原則及聯合機構恢復生氣。</p>

<p>新疆府委鮑爾漢在京留影</p>
<h3>張治中談新疆政局　中蘇關係如好轉當有良好影響　爭取人心必須在經濟方向着手</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕主席定廿三日下午六時邀宴府委鮑爾漢氏。張治中則於廿二日下午七時在寓邸宴鮑氏並邀政府首要作陪，張民頃已等待政府對新省之最後指示，以決定行止。張氏今接見記者時稱，渠認爲新省問題當仍以經濟爲主，俗說云「有奶便是娘」，吾人得使新省同胞對政府有好感，否則邊疆問題不易解決。張氏又調，蔣主席亦同意此種意見，渠與麥斯武德曾擬有計劃書呈主席開發新省之富蔽，並建議成立新省建設技術輔導圈。現該項計劃已送至政院。此案獲准後，張氏即將在京聘請工鑛技術，畜·收各種技術人才前往新疆。張氏稱，目前新疆一般局勢均甚安定，北塔山雙方仍對峙，該山主峯現在國軍手中，在新國軍實力雄厚，軍事上無問題。北塔山事件不致變成更嚴重事件。張認新疆問題爲民族問題，中蘇關係如能好轉，一切均有良好影響，非僅新疆問題爲然。張氏謂渠正搜集材料硏究巾蘇問題。對孫副主席最近關於中國外交政策之談話，張氏則拒絕表表示意見，僅稱目前中國問題爲世界問題之一部份，中國外交政策爲獨立自主，中國情勢與世界情形之關係不可否定。關於伊實問題，張氏稱：「伊方反對麥斯武德主新，希望本人留位，實則麥氏無被反對之理由。麥之聲望·學問及其奮鬥歷史，均應使之成爲新疆之領袖。中央因成信所關，將不致變更已頒之明令。如伊方堅持，以後當再考慮下一步措施。所謂土耳其斯坦運動，爲一種獨立運動”然新疆不够獨立條件，且擁護此運動者僅伊·塔·阿三區，其餘七區佔人口總數百分之八十以上，均擁護中央。中央政令僅在伊·塔·阿三區中不能到達。記者問：「伊寗反叛遝動，是否阿合買提江領導」？張答：「阿爲新省府改組後伊方擁護之副主席，後經中央任命者」。記者問：「外傳阿合買提江爲蘇聯人，確否」？張答：「伊寗與獻聯交界，此話無法證實」。張謂新省無共產黨活動，縱有亦屬秘密。張氏否認渠爲將主席考慮中之駐蘇大使人選之一，渠返任期未定。最後，張稱，今後解決新疆問題，當本民主作風，予人民以自由，取銷過去殘民政策，使盛世才時代之高壓手段成歷史陳跡，造成和平，民主，安樂的新疆。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕公務員待遇改善問題，監院廿二日晨談話會時曾再度討論，並作進一步決定，主要目的在做到總理所主張之生存平等，使上下能共甘苦。今日會中在原則上曾作如下決定：　目前生活指數己漲至戰前五萬倍以王，即根據官方所公布之統計，亦已漲至三萬一千倍，而公務員分給仍按千六百倍計算，自不合理，然若根據三萬倍或五萬倍計算，又非國庫所能負擔。惟據估計戰前普通公務員有卅元即足一月開支，此卅元若能根據生活指數無分上下普遍發給，當可解決最低限度生活所需，卅元以上則照目前標準設給，以示因工作較重而分之區別。　上述辦法若得難實行，則根據三萬一千倍之半數，即一萬五千倍發給。些二辦法實行若有困難，爲使由上而下能一致盤齊計，下列二辦法似可實行：</p>
<h3>公務員子女敎育　擬請由政府負責</h3>
<p>柴，米，油，鹽，醫藥，住房，子女敎育，咸由政府負担；此外酌給「零用費」部長，科員所享實物及福利待遇無分軒輕，僅零用費略有高下。　按照英國辦法，實行分配制，惟此法不易實行。會中最後決定，推于樹德，萬燦，李世軍三委員，共同擬稿，再於下次會中提出。</p>

<h3>新疆問題與張治中將軍</h3>
<p>新疆問題的最近情形，自西北行轅主任張治中將軍本月十一日出席國民黨中央黨國聯會作扼要之報告後，國人當已明白其眞象，及所謂新疆問題的癥結所在。適於此際，新疆籍之國府委員鮑爾漢，偕新省建設廳長穆罕默德伊敏，由迪飛京，晋謁中樞。鮑氏廿一日對京記者表示：新疆目前已無大問題，若干問題亦可望和平解決，並將向政府建議，使新疆永爲中華民國之領土。鮑爾漢爲新疆塔城人，早期留學德國，精通漢維俄德各種文字，著述頗多，張治中將軍主新時任副省主席，今年四月國府改組，氏被選任國府委員，爲代表社會賢達之府委。伊做為留土學生，熟硏回敎文化，通土印英維文字，曾一度供職中央。兩氏均爲新省開明人物，現正當新疆問題進到轉捩點的時候，聯袂晋京，並向中樞作重要建議，進似乎暗示新疆間題的光明，西陲風髮可望逐漸消失。其實，試再從遠處看，今天還未許我們如此樂觀。</p>
<p>新疆爲中華民國之一省，其地邊遠偏僻而沉寂，惟蘊藏豐富，地位衝要。新疆省之成爲問題，在表面上看，是錯綜複雜，包含外交問題，宗敎問題，社會問題，民族問題等，交織糾葛，紛擾不淸。在實際上，新疆問題却很簡單。張治中將軍以二年治新經騐，指出新疆問題爲外交民族兩問題交織而成，今後要解決此一問題，應該民族外交雙管齊下，而最根木之事，莫過於積極推行民生主義，完成新疆的建設。張氏渲幾句話，聽來是老生常談，實際上是很透澈很實際的。</p>
<p>我們展開新疆地圖，放眼看過去：在帕米爾高原的邊緣，從噴赤河起到芷爾果斯（位伊犁西，淸帝一再喪地寧國後的國界點），到哈巴爾阿蘇（塔城北〕烏列蓋，再從烏列蓋東南下到哈托里，有長遠幾千里蜿蜓曲折的邊界綫。在此綫以外，漠漠萬里，一片赤色，那邊有嚴齊的行政，有組織的商務集國和文化集團，抱着「安全慼」不斷向外伸張，不斷向外壓倒，這使發生了嚴重的外交問題。</p>
<p>其次是民族問題。新疆人口有四百三十萬，約有四百萬人是伊斯蘭敎徒，有獨特的宗敎文化，而四百餘萬人口中，各有各的風俗語言文字，維族人口較多，哈族次之，維哈各族又互不相容，政治上互有消長，便形成嚴重的民族問題。由於過去新疆地方當局的失政，多次發生民荻流血，於是民族問題更與外交問題連成一氣，卅四年九月遵有伊寧叛變的發生。</p>
<p>伊犁事變以哈族爲主體，伊犁塔城阿山三區，全部陷落。此時正値抗戰勝利結束，中央爲爭取國內和平，乃派張治中將軍赴新處理，與伊犁八次談判，成立了和平協定。去年七月一日，新疆省府根據和平條款改組，伊犁方面參加省府的，有六委員。今年五月，麥斯武德奉命爲新疆主席，不久又爆發了白塔山事件。白塔山事件未解決，新疆省政又發生分裂運動，首先是伊塔阿三區參議員，拒絕出席省參議會，接着是副主席阿合買提江，委員兼副廳長賴希木江的不辭而去。張治中將軍近曾公開致函阿賴，嚴詞詰問：是否要片面撕毀和平條款？是否再來一次武裝叛亂？或願再回迪化推誠商談？截至現在止，伊犁方面尙無答覆。幸迪化伊犁間的關係，尙能維持不墜，幷無完全破裂的徵象。但，張治中將軍管代表中央，抱着步步忍讓的政策，這個懸而未決的問題，却還沒有解決，依然夜長夢多。</p>
<p>張治中將軍治理新疆，有抱负，有见議，對伊劉問題的處理，我們信其必有步驟的。鮑爾漢與伊，的晋京，更說明了新疆四百餘萬人口中，有三于百餘萬先認戰中央，據議中央的，僅伊塔阿三區七十萬人，在少數野心家分裂陰謀之下，與迪化作激烈的政治鬥爭。看趨勢，新疆的外交問題，民族問題，已非地方性問題，幾已不能在新疆的省內求解決，中央可能接受張鮑議氏的新建議，以極度的容忍與智慧，重問新經疆問題和平談判之門。我們很同意，「和平統一民主自由」的原則，和平解決新疆問題，也祗有共同遵守和平統一民主自由的大目標，纔能凝結新疆各民族團結，然後以民族團結力量，努力於經濟建設，求新疆的安定。然而，我們儘管如此願劇，在少數野心家是否願放棄他們依附外援的心理，來共求新疆的建設與安定呢？　　最後，我們試更放大目光一看，新疆問題幾乎就是中國全局現象的縮影，而中國對蘇交涉的僵持與共匪之終於叛亂，又幾乎可以看做全世界大局糾紛莫解的縮影，新疆問題在目前恐怕是不容易完全解決得很好的。不過，無論如何，我們總得盡其在我去努力，而封疆大吏受有方面重任如張治中將軍者，更應早日回防坐鎭疆北，以收安定新疆及陝甘人心之效。</p>

<h3>英代表檢討世界局勢　嚴辭譴責蘇態度　盼蘇絃易轍挽回和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕級約二十二日廣播：今日英國出席聯合國大會首席代表國務大臣麥克尼爾，向大會發表演說，長遠二千六百字，闡明聯合王國這基本政策。內稱，苟蘇騁繼續強欲將其意志，迫使世界各國接受，則世界和平勢將崩潰，而造成嚴重後果。渠戰詞坪掣蘇聯，但仍籍請蘇聯改變態度。麥氏對維辛斯基所稱美國具有掣澁戰争竞向一點，斥爲無稽。渠對維辛斯基所稱馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃威齊歐洲各國主權一節，力予否認，並指齊蘇聯存心問撚原子能管制方案之通過，及其使用否決機選十次之多。麥氏之演說涉及世界政局之各方面，但其心主張乃在責難蘇聯之不妥協態度，以及此種態度對於世界和平之嚴重影。麥氏並云，今年十一月間在倫敦舉行之四强外長會議，將爲恢復和平之最後希望。</p>
<p>〔合衆社弗魯辛草地廿二日電〕英國今日參加美國方面公開指斥蘇聯之破壊聯合國，奧斯汀在其首次正式對蘇聯之答覆中，率直斥責維辛斯基之指美國爲「戰爭販子」爲說謊，且謂雜辛斯基在大會中之演說，爲譭謗挑撥性之謊言。英代表麥克尼爾浪隨奧斯汀之領導，將於大會中發表演說，「粉碎」蘇聯指責英美爲戰爭販子，並破壊聯合國之論據。麥氏對聯合國整個之局勢作一檢討，並以目前所以麻痺之責任，完全諉議蘇聯，猶如馬歇爾之言然。</p>
<h3>修改對義和約案　列入聯大會議程　中英等和國棄權穌波投反對票</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿一日電〕聯大指導委員會今日以四對二票，通過將修改對義和約案，列入聯大討論議程。贊成者美國。墨西哥。古巴。巴西，反對者蘇聯。液閘，藥樹者中英等八國。此案乃阿根廷所提，英代表蕭克魯斯於討論時稱，英政府認爲於目前由聯大討論義和約之修改，殊屬不智，英政府惟始終認爲對義和約規定，未盡合乎理想，然對是否宜於目前即行修正，甚表懐疑。英國對該案雖不反對，似亦不能支持。波蘭代表蘭燦聯吿稱，聯大於目前即行討論對義和約之修正，勢將危險地妨碍對德日和約之締結，盟國因此將使德日兩國在極堅强的保留態度之下簽訂和約。對義和約批准固僅一星期，遽由聯大討論修正，賓爲對德日之莫大鼓勵云。叙利亞代表柯里主張由安理曾迅速建議義大利之加人聯合國，加入以後，義大利即有醫請修改和約之機會。蘇代表葛維米柯掣稱，在談判對義和約時，美國並未表示有修正和約之意，今美國突然變更態度，並未使蘇聯感覺驚異。美國此舉便盟國亽協商對德日和約時，不能更易合作。阿根廷之建戰案之主張向簽訂對義和約之國建議給予義大利以機曾，俾得由其提出新意見，以减輕和約加諸義大利之義務。</p>

<h3>參議會四次大會揭幕　議長提出意見三點　節約運動已至非實行不可之時期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市參議會第一屆第四次大會，昨晨九時在塘沽路該會正式揭幕。參議員出席者百四十六人，列席者有吳市長，各局長以及其他黨政軍首長區民代表會主席，區保長等數十余人。揭幕典禮開始，由潘議長致詞略稱：本市市場參議會第一次大會，於去年九月舉行，迄今已屆一年，在過去一年中，本曾對市政設施建議及貢獻雖不多，但多少負了代表市民的責任，增加市民福利，减少市民痛苦，同時並替市府打算，期能在窮困之經濟情形下，盡最多做些事。議長並述及目前大局正値緊要關頭，本市物價高漲與局勢有關，而中秋節適又將屆，物價在此時期，往往有波動·因而此次開曾亦很重要，會期雖短·但我們一定要盡力對地方政治社會風氣，國家大局貢獻意見。</p>
<p>最後·就個人所想到時者提出三點意見：　本市市府三十七年度預算，必須在此次大會中提出，因若待至下次大會，則在十二月間，將不及送請中央核定，故希望在不增加市民負担及不使市府辦事受到砠碍之原則下，請市府當局趕緊編製下年度預算·參議會方面亦當儘速審核。　節約運動應積極推進，以上海目前情形看，是一很大的危機。前次四監察委員來滬調査後發表之感想，謂上海少數人的奢侈，造成多數人不得生活，此語實値得重視，同時上海爲國際都市，外人來滬者，常有人表示，中國要求向國外借款，何不向上海人自己捐募。故節約運動，已至非實行不可之時期。　中央對於直轄市之塊位，始終未確定，憲法上對直轄市自治僅謂「另以法律定之」，故希望議會儘量研究直轄市自治地位，根據上海過去地方自治經騐貢獻中央。此外並報吿，由於市府及參議會共同合作努力之結果，中央對發還敵偽圈佔民地民產及組識聯合電廠，已有　滿答覆，並派員開始辦理。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南市西倉路德華小學校校長蔣偽珍，五十五歲，江陰三官鄉人，本年六月，爲犯連續强奸未成年女學生朱月仙等十名，事發後，蔣避　無蹤，經地方法院檢察處嚴令通緝在案。詎蔣於數月前，避居原籍江陰倉　橋孫家衖張金漢家，因張係伊胞兄，蔣儒珍幼時螟蛉在外，故不復姓張。蔣於歸後，擬赴蘇北，託兄向三官鄉副鄕長胡慶聲秘密活動，更名張銀漢，請伊設法代領國民證。本月十八日，胡慶聲囑戶籍司事胡炳煜速塡張之國民證一紙，胡見其形色慌張，遍査戶口册無張銀漢其人，乃密吿鄕長胡復經調査結果，方知化名，又悉係通緝犯，即於晚間十時，派自衛隊將蔣捕獲。十九日解縣政府，二十日由徐縣長親自訊問，蔣對强奸女生事否認，僅供華德小學係其一手借屋租地創辦，煞費苦心，因校址鄰近有朱胡氏，年逾四十，其夫在輪局任事，每星期方回，其女月仙，在華德讀書，本人亦常至朱家閒談，遂與朱氏發生曖昧，因朱家生活拮據時常接濟經濟。不料華德小學突漕回綠，本人心血盡會一炬，因經濟因經濟困難，當向朱氏討錢，彼此感情破裂，氏乃起毒心，串同低級社會人士，大事宣傳，謂本人強奸未成年人女生，又使其女誣說，致各女生家長控諸法院，本人恐吃眼前　，一走了事，真是最毒婦人心，今已被補，俟赴滬歸案后，當盡力與朱胡氏剖白云云。江陰縣府訊後收押，俟備文咨照上海地院，派警到澄迎提。</p>
<h3>飛機中途呼救　旅客準備跳傘　東京來機一場虛驚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西北航空公司上海號，此次由美啓程經由東京來滬，昨日下午五時三十分，距上海僅有五十英里時，此間中航公司忽接獲該機之救急呼號，謂機內失火，情形危急·機師已通知旅客，準備跳傘逃生·要求中航公司立即派機接救。</p>
<p>中航機接電後，當即派○46機一架，立時升空，旋在空中又接獲「上海號」之電報，謂火已熄滅，可吿無事矣。</p>
<p>是時，中航機塲方面業已將救火車救護車等佈置妥當，蓋猶防「上海號」降落時，再發生不測也。至五時四十分，「上海號」徐徐降落，竟安然無恙。迨旅客匆匆下機後，即將全機各部加以檢騐，不特客艙內一無跡象可尋，即貨艙之內亦毫無異狀。</p>
<p>後據機師盤克談當時情景稱；該機之構造，貨艙內原設有火警自動警報設，過有火警時，其通至駕駛室中之紅燈，即會自動發亮，如火熄滅，則紅燈亦即自動閉熄。昨日渠駕駛上海號飛抵離上海五十英里時，忽發覺前貨艙之警燈突吿明亮，當時渠急以自動滅火機加以施救，未幾果然紅燈熄滅，表示業已無事。方慶渡過機關之時，不料後貨艙之紅燈　亦發亮·雖再以自動滅火機加以施救·並米見效，因此被迫一面發電求救，一面低飛至三百尺上空·通知旅客準備跳傘逃生。然在此千鈞一髮之際，後貨艙之警燈旋亦熄滅·至斯始吿安心·終於降落龍華機塲。事後據中航機械人員再三硏究檢騐結果，始發現造成此一場虛驚者，實由於「火警自動警報燈」本身發生毛病·以致忽明忽暗，實際上並無火警其事也。</p>
<p>昨日搭乘該機來滬之旅客共有十一人·朱世明夫人亦在內·係於該機飛經東京時搭乘者。據談當時情景，全機旅客均極鎭靜，其中尙有菲籍空中小姐二人，管及此事，不禁啞然失笑。</p>

<h3>新聞整蕭運動第一砲　首都不肖記者六人　索「招待費」被檢舉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕新聞陣營整　聲中，首都已以其體行動檢興藉驛館名義進行敲詐之不肖記者。此事於二十日揭戰於報端，迄廿二日暫吿段落。首都新聞界人士對此極爲注意，聞記者公會即將有所決定·作爲整肅運動之第一砲。</p>
<p>日前，京市一市民劉鎭南，自殺於其仇人藍世昌門前，當日下午，即有數記者赴藍宅訪問，以各報所載未符事實，須由藍出面招待新聞界爲名榮取招待費一千二百萬元，經一再治减，說妥三百萬元。但此事爲另一記者所悉，本市縱橫通訊社即於十九日發稿，詳述此事，廿日中央日報首予刋載。首都記者公會，首都通訊業協會，及本市各報社通訊社負責人極爲重視，決派員</p>
<p>調查眞象</p>
<p>廿一日午，首都七主要報紙派員聯合探訪，真像遂獲大折。參與聯合探訪之七記者，計中央日報胡孝先，和平日報周希　，新民報錢少舫，大剛報張公度，社會日報彭逸民，建設日報白耀溪，南京人報陸續。渠等奉命於廿一日赴藍宅訪問，並邀檢舉人談話，已獲悉全部經過，當晚集體執筆，完成報道文字一篇，於二十二日由各報刋載。據</p>
<p>集體報道</p>
<p>稱：檢舉人為縱橫社新聞供給者郞文宗，渠謂：參與敲詐之記者共六人，據藍二小姐告知，其中五人為社會新聞通訊這記者石少方，建設日報記者夏淸雲，社會日報記者樂伯元，首都晚　兼大同社記者曹維泉，和平日報記者陳繼深。另一人尙不詳。郞稱：「據渠調査，陳爲寃枉，因渠乃被人拖去，想業不致有此行爲。」</p>
<p>據集體報道所述，曹，夏，樂三人先訪藍世昌，樂並邀藍赴社會日報談話，勸藍第二日招待記者。次日，彼等一再向</p>
<p>藍之女兒</p>
<p>及同學等接洽，索取招待記者之費用，並命請吃咖啡土司及晚飯。藍等知其企圖，認爲彼等人格有問題，擬置不理，其後「各小報上，散見各種不正確的覔曲報導」。時郞文宗往採訪，始知個中真象。郞目稱爲首都記者公會整肅委員會代表前往調査·遂獲得上項名單，在報端公布此事。</p>
<p>此事真相旣明，新聞界人士乃決定有所表示，聞首都記者公會擬將琴加此事之記者</p>
<p>開除會籍</p>
<p>以示整虛。惟上述五人中之和平日報陳繼深，於外間紛傳此事時，即呈請報社暫行辭職，謂此次係被誣，真相不久常大白，爲表示自我負責，擬懇准予暫行離職，以便靜候檢舉，並依法進行解決，務求水落石出，期能達成整肅新聞界之目的。</p>
<p>記者撰稿至此，得悉：京不肖訊者敲詐案，有關各報已作</p>
<p>適當措置</p>
<p>如下：建設日報夏表云，社會日　桑伯元，已被報館當局停職，聽候法律解決。首都晚報載大同社記者曹維泉之身份尙成問題。大同社謂曹並非該社記者，首都晚報則謂　有曹潮，無曹維泉其人，首都晚崔社長唐文瀾認郞文宗及廿二日刊戰此事之各報，污蔑該報，應負法律責任。和平日報陳繼深謂渠對敲詎事全然不知，陳向記者公會陳明寶情外，擬向郞文宗以損害名譽罪起訴·社會新聞社則認爲石少芳爲該社之特約記者，石在外以該社記者名義招搖，干犯法紀，當待法律制裁。另聞曹維泉，樂伯元亦擬向郞文宗起訴。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕首都記者公會爲實行整肅新聞界陣營，曾決議組織整肅委員會，由中央日報社長馬星野爲召集人，馬因事冗辭職，改定由該會組織組負召集之責。該組以此事關係全體會員名醫，除派員調査眞相，藉正視聽外，特製定獎勵檢興辦法，公布實行，以防止今後再有類似事件之發生。該辦法中規定：</p>
<p>凡本會會員·爲愛護團體名譽負責檢舉不肖同業，經本會調査屬實者，得於事後由本會頒給榮譽獎狀，並以公開儀式授予之。</p>
<p>凡社會各界人士負責檢舉不肖記者，經本社調査麗實者得於事後由本會贈予獎金，其數額爲被檢舉人服務單位，全部薪津三個月至六個月之和，視其情節之輕重而定，由被撿舉人所服務之單位，自被檢舉人扣繳送會轉發。</p>
<p>前條所謂負賣字樣，指檢舉人必須列具眞實姓名，住址及職務，並簽名蓋章，祥列所檢舉之事實而言，如有挾嫌誣吿·一經査實，檢舉人亦當負法律上之責任。</p>
<p>凡檢舉函件，一律請寄送記者公會組識祖，本會絕對代檢舉人保守秘密。</p>

<h3>巨奸葉蓬之末日</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日訊〕勝利以來，大漢奸一個個落網，一個個判刑，政府執法如山，絲毫不苟，這是一件最令人痛快的事。巨奸葉蓬·於淪陷時期，盤踞武漢，於昨晨九時半，在京執行槍決，一代巨奸，於十六週年之「九一八」國恥紀念日清晨伏法，頗能一振人心，也能一快人心。晨八時四十分，庭上宣稱：「漢奸葉蓬，通敵叛國，圖謀反抗本國，判死刑。」葉逆聞判以后　強作鎮定的樣子，連稱：「沒有什么」　「無所謂」，祗請求宜讀主席手令的內容。他似乎有點慌張，說話有點口訥，問庭上讓不讓他說幾句話，庭上呌他簡單的說出來。</p>
<p>他說這次的死，一定有人作祟。他又說：爲了老母，沒有逃出武漢，沒有辦法，只得去香港，在去港以前，又那裏想到「艷電」之類的　。后來他又裝出「慷慨」的樣子說：我是前線打出來的，我並不怕死·人都有一死，死何足畏，否則，我也不做軍一人。最後，他還說：我雖然如此下塲，但仍希望國家統一·人民生活安定，委座身體健康」。一說到這裏，葉逆又轉過身來，向所有的聽審者投射似在　求同情的一醫，他發出死前最后的哀求：在這里都是不外人，都是「老同志」，希望大家不要以「漢奸」來宣傳，在報紙上不要以「漢奸」來稱呼！我沒有遺賤，我的家庭都是在上海，希望大家能同情我這要求！一這時，他似乎對死發生無限感慨的樣子。</p>
<p>九時零十分押上大卡車，駛向中華門外天界寺新刑塲，九點二十五分抵達，葉逆下軍後，伸出微微顫抖的手，和監刑官羅所長等一一握別，連說：「沒有法子」！「沒有法子」！九點半，走入刑塲·正當他想回頭一望的時候，槍聲突響，前兩槍未中要害，第三松由后背射入，從右肺葉下穿出，葉逆仆地·腸亦流出，全身作痙攣抽搐不已，三分鐘後，氣絕畢命。（特約記者丁匡華）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紡聯會第二屆會員大會昨晨十時　開，由束　掌任主席，先由紡建公司工務及業務兩處負責人報告。歸納目前紡建工務上之困難為：　零件不够，且接收工廠多為日式。日本戰前有一千五百萬錠，目前僅開工二百八十萬錠，多餘之　件不少，故希望今後能取得日本方面之接濟，　電力不足，因此工廠所受之直接間接損失均大。　原料問題，紡建所紡均為一十支以上之細紗，故原料全賴外棉，希望能提高進口額。業務方面，生要工作在供應民間需要及調節紗布價格，方法屢改，宗旨不變。爭取外匯亦盡最大努力，紗布出口已得四百六十萬美金及一百六十萬英鎊，今後希望民營紗廠合作，加強外銷。報告畢，即開始討論及通過提案，合計會務原料生產運銷經濟行政五組提案七十二件，均根據審査報告順利通過。</p>
<h3>臨時動議</h3>
<p>此時出席代表提出緊急臨時動議三件：　劉國鈞代表提議反對農市收購棉花案。認為此舉越出農行職務，有意與紗廠競爭。討論後通過。　石鳳翔潘仰山汪竹一等二十人提出建議政府向對日和會堅持重訂日本工業水準要求紡錠賠償並聲明保留否決權案。討論後通過，並由大會分電行政院經濟部外交部及參政會。　劉文勝提議建議政府迅行挽救經濟危機從速整理幣制勿僅作消極限價政策以免影饗生產案，議決通過。</p>

<p>我國棉紡細業，有六十年之　史，為我國較有基礎之民族工業。夷考先進各國工業進化，莫不以紡織工業　其基。因此，本屆大會連續開會三天，經縝密之研究，僉以我人應一面喚起全國各界人士之注意，一方面鼓勵本業從業人員一致之努力，同肩重任，依照蔣主席之昭示，完成一千萬錠之目標，以解　內人民衣被之恐慌，爭取國外貿易市場。然此非一蹴可幾，必須於培養人材，自製機械，推廣原料三端，同時邁進，自力更生，以底於成。此外，關於提高生產效率，减輕製造成本，劃一品質標準，亦應力謀改進。惟事業之成功，必先備具足以生存之條件，而後方可謀發展。本業從業員固須作應有之努力，而政府及社會各界人士，亦必多多予以有力之協助，庶可事半功借，國計民生，交相利賴。茲當大會閉幕，謹揭　上述三端，以與國人共勉之。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律質釋</h3>
<p>十年前舊事　淸理債務發生糾紛</p>
<p>幣値變遷的一幕揷曲</p>
<p>編輯先生：某甲於民國廿六年向其摯友某乙借得法幣二百元，立有契約。言明三年內還淸，無息，今甲方欲償還該款，而將所出契約收回，但乙方堅持法幣貶値，際言須依米價比例計算。如此則償款將數萬倍於當時數額甲方以此數過鉅，不能負擔。經人調解無效，今有疑問數點，請求解答，　民國廿五年之借款，今日償還，是否須加成計算。有無明文規定，　法幣貶値，其法定貶値率如何，　今以三十萬元償還原款二百元，是否合法，　關係類似糾紛撮高法院有無判例，其判決情形如何。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕　並無明文規定，但得依照復員後辦理民事訴訟補充規則第十二條之規定，請求法院公平裁量為增減給付。　法律並不承認，亦無法定貶値率。　原屬合法，但　權人如以為顯失公平者，得訴請法院裁址之。　最高法院尚無判例，法院方面之處斷，隨地而與，據答者所知，上海方面，戰前銀行存款，曾有二千倍及四千倍等付還之判例。而浙江高等法院則會就嘉興張世培上訴一案，張係因友人張兆宗，在民國廿八年間，向其借款法幣二百五十元，戰時無法追償，抗戰勝利，屢經談判，　方意見，朱獲接近，以致涉訟，初由當地法院判決，被告以一千倍償還，原告不服上訴，經判決以一萬倍償付。</p>

<h3>日本十五名戰犯無罪</h3>
<p>— 赤父</p>
<p>正當日本投降簽字二週年的前夕，麥克阿瑟元帥又對日本公佈了又一「德政」。那便是合衆社八月卅一日東京電：一日本前內閣閣員五人，內一人為海軍大將，一人偽陸軍大將，一人為財閥領袖，與其他尚未經審判之主要戰犯十人，於三十日自巢　監獄巾被開釋」。</p>
<p>常這些戰犯被釋出獄時，紛紛詢問監獄當局：「開釋了!是確實的事麼？」人人驚喜若狂，五體投地感謝麥帥的聖德。</p>
<p>當這個消息傳到世界時，人人信疑參半，信的是麥帥的專斷，和他縱容日本的政策，必然有此一事，祇是縱容得過火，不合時機；疑的是波茨坦宣言的「精神」，不由戰敗國毀減，不由聯合國毀減，竞由美國片面的破壞。未來對日和會，呌盟國人們怎麽講話？未來對日和約條款怎麼下筆？眞是令人納悶的事。</p>
<p>公平的說，　帥釋放這批戰犯，實為一種錯誤的措施，盟國人士應該抗議！尤其是盟國檢察官（中國檢察官為向哲濬）宣佈這批戰犯不起訴，實在荒謬已極，監國人士應該抗議！現在我們介紹這批「無罪」侵略者的履歷，讓公平的讀者去評斷吧：</p>
<p>鮎川義介日本頂大的財閥為「滿洲國」工業獨裁，日本四前社長，貴族院議員。他是「滿洲」經濟侵略的大頭腦日本軍需工業生產的主流</p>
<p>小林躋造現役　軍大將，曾任海軍次官，聯合艦隊司令長官，台灣總督，巾央協力會議議長，　政曾長，曾任小磯內閣的外務大臣。她在台灣總督任內，以台灣基地侵略中國及太平洋，她是日本海軍之魂。</p>
<p>眞崎甚三郞預備役陸軍大將，軍事參議官，她是「二二六」事變的領袖，日本前期「少壯」激烈份子，製造了多次事變，均與發動侵略有關。</p>
<p>村田省藏曾任近　內閣遞信大臣，太平洋戰爭時任駐菲律賓傀儡政府的大使。</p>
<p>大達茂雄曾任東條內閣內務大臣，太平洋戰爭時任「昭南」（星加坡）市長，並且儘量芟除英人勢力。</p>
<p>酒井忠正曾任阿部內閣農林大臣。</p>
<p>松坂　政曾任東條內閣司法大臣。</p>

<h3>暖水袋的正作用</h3>
<p>在美國著作家的心目中，巾國女子有異乎　常的智　，她們會利用醫院裏常備的橡皮袋作為暖手袋，而且在某一個時期蔚成風氣，機乎是凡　女性，人心一袋，袋的顏色也分成金色，銀色，紅色，灰色，綠色，粉紅色等多種，再加上一方綢手帕，好比錦上添花。美國女性決計不會那麼想得週到，而且引人入勝。暖小袋本來的功用，是醫院裏用來消散　瘤腫疼的，如果你身上任何部分生了一個瘸子，醫生給你一只橡皮袋灌滿了熟水，溫在患處，每天數次，三五日後自腫消疼止，倘在夏天覺得熱水不舒服，可改用冰水，冰水具有同樣的消腫功用。這種治療法在中國民間極為通行，不過鄕間沒有暖水袋，他們用燒菜的剷刀，把剷刀在鍋裏炙熱了，輕輕在患處　打，每天打數次，打得患者焦炙難受，打了幾次腫疼也就好了，這種土法被中國式的西醫認為迷信，劃刀怎樣可以治病呢？其實治病的不是剷刀而是熱氣，當美國出口商把大批暖水袋遝到巾國時，美國醫藥界看到出口貨中暖水袋出口數字，不覺大為吃驚，認為巾國醫學何以發達得如此迅速，單是暖水袋就　用那麼多，其他衛生用品更可想而知了，後來特地派了幾位醫學　威到中國考察衛生　業，發現中國女子都携有一只暖水袋，不覺暗自失笑，回到美國後，其中有一位權威寫了一本　訊　的書，盛稱巾國女子的穎　，中國人聰明的事很多，　竹難　，諸如把　子脚管紮緊了裝米，把洗浴木盆當劃船用，南京人把三　機器脚路軍改裝　八人座送客汽車，砲仗當DDT用，電影報糊　　，鈔票引火吸捲烟，都是合乎經濟原則的創作。</p>
<p>以上人物，都是麥帥一九四五年九月十二日後開始逮捕的，二年以來未經審判，即由遠東　際軍事法庭檢察官宣告「無罪」釋放，是合理麽？讓讀者去評判吧！</p>
<h3>日本人民　論麥帥</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈譯</p>
<p>〔譯者按〕美國觀察雜誌記者曾訪問日本人民，以「你心目中的麥帥」為詢，他們的回答幾乎千篇一律，先稱頌麥帥，然後大嘆苦經，以博得美國人的　情和援助，狡猾的日本民族！</p>
<p>學生：大多數的日本人認為目前的軍事管制狀態是有益於我國的。麥帥是一個奇才，你們美國人應該支持他。可惜食物供應情況不佳，今年是生死關頭之年，房屋缺乏，你會時常發現五六個家庭同住於一個居室內的情形</p>
<p>旅館書記：每一個日本人都認為麥帥是一個好人，我們具有希望，希望你們的軍隊仍機續在此直至日本人能自助為止，第一你們必須協助我們消減黑市，各物無不高昂，糖的價値已超過珍寳。</p>
<p>旅　經理：日本人都極感愉快，為了你們派遺麥帥前來我國，蘇聯就不會待我如此仁愛，我們希望美國人　讃助我恢復戰前狀態。食物和衣料都感不足，除其求向黑市。</p>
<p>報童：物價太高，我希望道是最高峯。可是美國官員待我如此仁慈，我願為他們工作，我希望我能謁見麥帥。</p>
<p>雜貨店主：生活狀況已較一年前為佳，食物仍感缺乏，衣料亦然。年前，我們毫無所有，麥帥使人民獲得工作，我們迫切需要自由貿易，我們喜愛和需要美</p>
<p>珠寳商：我願見物價低落，在軍事管制下，一般狀況已較佳。我瞭解美國人，我與他們交易了二十年，他們是好的國民，正如麥帥一樣。我希望即刻再能自由貿易，日本需要它。</p>
<p>商人：國家支出已較戰前高出三百倍至四百倍，我們希望你們能留此直至我們能自力更生。我們恐懼穌聯，我們需要麥帥的保護，他會阻止蘇聯以其對付歐陸各國的方式重施於我國。</p>
<p>書店老關：生活狀況很壞，黑市使我們痛苦掙扎。我們需要更多的援助，我們需要美國，我國政府所不的足力量僅麥帥能滿足之。</p>
<h3>請展緩禁舞</h3>
<p>— 李玲</p>
<p>跳舞，在歐美各文明國家，原是男女間正當的娛樂，普通的交際，但是橘　淮而化枳，一到了我們中國就變了質，變成了沒有出路的，在饑　綫上掙扎着的可憐者們賴以生存的職業。考其所以變質的原因，這是不必諱言的，是當前社會並不單純的嚴重問題。跳舞的變質，不過是社會不良現象　細微的表現</p>
<p>舞女的所以為舞女，是他們甘心以色相來博取公子哥兒們的歡心嗎！他們是自甘下流，不去能加生產事來工作嗎？我們舉目一看，畢業即失業的男女靑年們，他們有參加生產工作的志趣，　意為國家為社會効力，為他們目己的前途奮鬥，可是現在社會的生產部門，實在太少，連這一批純潔有為的男女智識靑年，還不能安插，何況對於我們這一批缺乏生產技術，智力不足，能力不够的舞女與業從業員。</p>
<p>有人說：「舞女的生活太奢侈了」。這是我們不否認的事實，但是奢侈的舞女，事實上不過是少數，我們百份之九十以上，晚上操舞業，白天要自己來料理家務，有子女的，還得要照顧孩子，並且還負着家庭主婦及職業婦女的二重工作，倘使單看到少數生活奢侈的舞女，就以為所有的舞女都是是奢侈，那無異是說：「學店　錢，敎育是要不得的」</p>
<p>禁舞，不　增加上海二萬多的失業人數，更加重了社會急應解決而不能解決的失業問題。古語說：「衣食足，而後知榮辱」，要是社會眞有了維持我們生活的出路，政府不必禁舞，我們會自動改業。反之，政府雖然下令禁舞，實際上只製造了二萬多人的悲慘命運而已！我們希望賢明的政府，把禁令展緩實施，使我們有喘息的機會，能够從容改業。（按：李女士為上海舞女聯誼會理事之一）</p>
<h3>卅六年來的「自由談」</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>從民國九年四月一日起，到民國二十一年十一月三十日止，這一段相當長的時間，由周瘦鵑主持，共十二年。在「自由談」寫稿的，都是當時海上著名的所謂「禮拜六派」文人，內容不外乎「談情說愛」「風花雪月」「海闊天空」之類。一度將篇幅分為「閒話」，「雜錄」，「所聞雜遺」，「游記」，「劇談」，「餘滴」，「瑣錄」等類，其他，長篇連載的章　小說和文壇掌故也從未間斷過。</p>
<p>這樣的作風直到二十一年年底　烈文接　自由談後，方才有突然的轉變，而縱承這一衣鉢的，是新創的「春秋一副刋，仍由周瘦鵑主　。</p>
<p>黎烈文主編「自由談」的一段時期，雖有　有短短的一年又五個月，但是，它突破了「自由談」往日的風格，向另一的方向寫作，使常時文藝靑年，受到影響甚深。那時候，的的確確是「自山談」也是中國近代文藝史料上重要的一頁！</p>
<p>那時、本報史故總經理量才先生正在　　將甲報積極改進，適黎烈文剛從法國回來，　延聘他到巾報來主編「自由談」。黎氏接編後第一砲，便將張資平所著的「時代與愛的歧路」長篇連載小說腰斬。張炎平的小說因此聲響大落。黎烈文把自由談完全變成新文學的基地，常時中國第一流作家幾乎為自由談一網打盡。經常撰稿的，有魯　，郁達夫，茅盾，老舍等，同時因為注重雜文，提拔了不少新作家，如康強，孔另境等。</p>
<p>正因為那時一自由談」行文　有爆炸性的　故，終於掛出了「准談風月」的啓事，風格稍兌平淡，但是作家仍舊是原班人馬。其中魯迅為特殊關係，用了不少的筆名，比較常用的是「何家幹」「　之餘」「　粥」「旅华」「洛文」等，到後來，因為自己不便出面，索性寫了文章，託人抄寫，加上一個筆名　去，所以甚至連編輯也披瞞住了。這些文字，後來都由魯　　入「偽自由書」「准風月談」以及「花邊文學」　內。</p>
<p>其間，有好幾塲大　戰，如學生讀莊子文選問題，大衆語問題，甚至幽默問題，女婿問題，都很有名，在各人的散文　內司以見到</p>
<p>二十三年五月，黎氏去職，由張梓生　　（五月九日），從絢爛歸於平淡，至廿四年十一月一日停刊。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，申報一度遷到漢口香港出版。在香港的一年多時期中，「自由談」也出版了一些時侯。民國二十七年　十節，申報在上海復刋，由「王任叔」主　「自由談」，仍有「魯迅風」。</p>
<p>不久改胡山源編輯，執筆多靑年文人，如丁諦，文宗山等，風格更趨平淡。年餘，由黃嘉　生編，專刋西洋小品，科學趣味，與他辦的西風華誌同一風格。</p>
<p>這樣，到三十一年十二月八日，太平洋戰事爆發，隨報紙停刋。</p>
<p>勝利後，申報在滬光榮復刋，「自由談」最初仍由黃嘉音主編，去年五月間，由本報副總編輯卜少夫主編。今年二月，由錢台生接編，直到現在。</p>
<p>目前關於「自由談」的一切，不必多說了。這裏附帶一筆的，是「自由談」原為新文藝的園地，勝利後將他移植到「春秋」去了。而「自由談」專刊新聞性。教育性，科學，知識以及趣味性的小品文字。上文己經說過，「自由談」的風格與內容，儘管一再改變，而原則只有一個，始終是名副其實的「自由談」，自由自在的　，沒有偏見，也沒有拘束！（下）</p>

<h3>The UN Steering Committee Passes the Motion to Include the Korean Question on the Agenda; Our Delegation Explains the Reasons for Supporting the US Proposal but Reserves the Right to Advocate for Korean Independence</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 21st] Today, the United Nations Steering Committee passed a motion with twelve votes against two to recommend that the General Assembly discuss the Korean independence question proposed by the United States. The Soviet Union and Poland voted against the motion. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, criticized the opinions of most committee members, stating that Marshall's speech to the General Assembly on the 17th "erroneously and distortedly" reported the situation in Korea. He also stated that according to the Four-Power Moscow Agreement of December 1945, the Korean question should be resolved through negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. The United States' submission of the question to the United Nations General Assembly was a rebellion against its agreement with the other three powers, and therefore this matter was "illegal." The US representative, Austin, replied that according to Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly can make any recommendations on any issue related to the general welfare of countries, and therefore the United States' raising of this issue was purely within the explicit provisions and spirit of the Charter. Austin pointed out that the reason why the Korean question was suffering setbacks was because the four powers had failed to reach an agreement. He said, "Under such circumstances, aside from submitting it to the General Assembly for discussion, is there any other way?"</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] The Korean Observer Group attending the United Nations General Assembly today issued a statement criticizing the Soviet Union's opposition to the United States' proposal to have the General Assembly discuss the Korean question, stating that according to various reports, northern Korea has now become a Communist military base, full of Korean Communist troops, Chinese Eighth Route Army troops, and frontline Soviet troops. Although the number of US occupation troops in southern Korea has decreased, estimated at only 30,000, the number of Soviet troops in the north has increased instead, reaching 300,000.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 21st] Today, the Chinese representative, Yuan Weijun, formally announced in the United Nations Steering Committee that China agrees with the United States' proposal to include the question of Korean independence on the agenda of this General Assembly, and stated China's position: "The Chinese delegation agrees to include the United States' proposal regarding Korean independence on the agenda of this General Assembly. However, we still hope to clarify China's position. According to the Cairo Declaration (which the Soviet Union subsequently agreed to in Potsdam), the four major powers all guaranteed the restoration of Korean independence. The Moscow Agreement of December 1945 between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union (which China also agreed to afterward) also stipulated that the four countries should negotiate and agree to establish a provisional government for Korea and establish a free and independent Korea as soon as possible. Before the four powers sign a new agreement to change or substantially alter the above two agreements, the four countries should still be bound by the obligations stipulated in these two agreements. Including the Korean question on the agenda of the General Assembly does not affect the four countries' status under the above agreements. The future of Korea has a great and profound relationship with China, so we sincerely hope that all countries should make every effort to accelerate Korea's achievement of freedom and independence and occupy its rightful place in the United Nations. The Chinese delegation also hopes to state that our explanation is limited to describing our reasons for supporting the US proposal. When discussing the merits of this issue in the future, we will elaborate on our position at that time."</p>
<h3>Passage of Motion to Establish a 55-Nation Standing Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] Today, the Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed, with fourteen votes against two, a motion to include on the agenda of this General Assembly the proposal by Secretary of State Marshall to establish a 55-nation standing committee. Only the Soviet Union and Poland opposed the motion. During the debate, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, while supporting the inclusion of the proposal on the agenda, stated that he reserved China's attitude when debating the merits and demerits of the plan. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, consistently opposed the plan, denouncing it as conflicting with the basic principles of the United Nations organization. He stated that the standing committee's powers would be parallel to those of the Security Council, making it an illegal and unconstitutional organization. Once the Charter is violated, it will lead to extremely dangerous habits, causing the Charter to no longer be respected, which would be detrimental to the United Nations organization and not beneficial. The US representative, Austin, refuted Gromyko's claim that the proposal was illegal, pointing out that the proposal was not only completely legal but could also revitalize the principles of the Charter and the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>International Women's Association Holds General Assembly in Nanjing; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Delivers Speech, Hoping Friends Can Truly Understand China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The International Women's Association held a general assembly at Jinling Women's University at 4:30 PM today. Over a hundred people attended, including Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Yifang, Lady Ponsonby, wife of the British Ambassador, the wife of the Indian Ambassador, and women from various countries who have come to China. Chairman Maynard delivered a speech, reporting the association's purpose: to serve society, establish international friendship, and enhance mutual understanding. Madame Chiang Kai-shek then delivered a speech, stating in brief: "This international organization fully demonstrates the true meaning of the world as one family. You have come from different countries, and I hope that you can exchange and contribute the cultural spirit of your respective countries with each other. When you return to your countries in the future, the impressions you bring back will constitute important data for your personal impressions of China. I have long had a simple idea, and I firmly believe that life should have two major goals, and these two goals have a very close relationship in human behavior, namely: how to cultivate and enhance one's own wisdom and spirituality, and how to help others cultivate and enhance their wisdom and spirituality. I would like to offer some suggestions that may help you understand China. I suggest that your association understand the thinking of the Chinese people by studying and exploring the cultural heritage of China. In addition, if you want to deeply understand China, I hope that you can interact more with the Chinese people. China has recently undergone the refining of fire and blood, but it has not yielded slightly. In China's extremely difficult times, peace-loving people around the world have given China valuable encouragement and assistance. However, we also know that there must be a time when many Chinese friends will be disappointed by the delay in China's rejuvenation work. But no matter how serious the difficulties and hardships, we will never be discouraged, but will make us more determined and stronger. There are still difficult years ahead for China, but whether we receive world assistance or not, we are prepared to strive for success to the end. I feel deeply in the venue today that everyone is expressing sympathy and understanding for China's current arduous task. I hope that you can truly understand China. After you return to your countries in the future, I believe that you will all become important links in promoting international understanding, and thus establish peace in the future world."</p>
<h3>South Africa Discriminates Against Overseas Chinese; Compatriots Request Submission for Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently received a telegram from the Chinese General Association of Transvaal Province in South Africa stating: "The South African Federal Government is actively implementing its new Asian zoning regulations promulgated last year. Thousands of our overseas Chinese will be eliminated by it. Please earnestly negotiate and submit the matter to the United Nations General Assembly for a reasoned argument." The association believes that the South African Federal Government's promulgation of this discriminatory law against overseas Chinese has a significant impact on the relations between the two countries and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting a serious negotiation.</p>
<h3>Business Representatives to Japan; Joint Presidium Compulsory Dispatch; Elections Have Begun in Various Places</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Various places have begun selecting business representatives to be dispatched to Japan and are processing application procedures. The representative from Taiwan Province has been determined, but some places have also been allocated quotas but do not intend to nominate candidates. A reporter recently learned from reliable sources that the Standing Committee does not intend to take other measures because trade with Japan does not imply any coercion. Whether or not to go depends entirely on individual interest. Another person familiar with the international trade situation stated that trade with Japan may be difficult to progress because Japanese goods are expensive and of poor quality, with little profit to be made. The number of British businessmen going to Japan is also less than originally planned, and the reason is also this.</p>
<h3>Our Ambassador to Sweden; Submits Credentials in the Next Few Days</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] After the upgrading of the embassies between China and Sweden, the credentials of our first ambassador, Xie Weilin, have been telegraphed to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are expected to be submitted to the Swedish King within days. Following our decision to mutually upgrade the rank of envoys with Sweden, there are the United States, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Norway, and other countries. If Xie can complete the arrival procedures early, he should be able to obtain the position of leader of the diplomatic corps in Sweden.</p>
<h3>International Recreation Club; Resumes Social Activities</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The International Recreation Club was originally a place for diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in Nanjing to gather and socialize before the war. It has been suspended since the war. Now the diplomatic corps has decided to resume various social activities in the near future to enhance friendship. It is reported that Paulin Zeller, Commercial Counselor of the US Embassy, has been appointed to prepare for and preside over the event.</p>
<h3>Governor of Macau Arrives in Guangzhou; Makes First Courtesy Visit After Taking Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] The Governor of Macau, Oliveira, came to Guangzhou on the 22nd to make his first official courtesy visit to our military and political authorities after taking office. Mayor Ouyang personally went to the pier to welcome him. In the evening, Mayor Ouyang and Chairman Luo respectively hosted cocktail parties and dinners to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over Enemy and Puppet Housing; Investigations Begin in Parts of Nanjing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The four supervisors, He Hanwen, etc., went to Shanghai this time for investigation. In addition to investigating the use of foreign exchange, supervisors He Hanwen and Du Guangxun also investigated disputes over enemy and puppet property.

<p>A photo of Xinjiang Provincial Committee member Burhan in Nanjing</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Discusses the Political Situation in Xinjiang; Good Relations Between China and the Soviet Union Will Have a Positive Impact; Winning Hearts and Minds Must Start with the Economy</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a banquet for Provincial Committee member Burhan at 6 PM on the 23rd. Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for Burhan at his residence at 7 PM on the 22nd and invited key government officials to accompany him. Zhang Min has been waiting for the government's final instructions on Xinjiang Province to decide on his course of action. Zhang told reporters today that he believes that the Xinjiang issue should still be mainly economic. As the saying goes, "He who has milk is the mother." We must make the compatriots in Xinjiang Province feel good about the government, otherwise, the border issue will not be easy to resolve. Zhang also stated that Chairman Chiang also agreed with this view. He and Maswood co-drafted a plan and presented it to the Chairman to develop the wealth of Xinjiang Province and suggested the establishment of a technical guidance circle for Xinjiang construction. The plan has now been sent to the Executive Yuan. After the case is approved, Zhang will hire engineering and mining technology, animal husbandry, and various technical talents in Beijing to go to Xinjiang. Zhang said that the general situation in Xinjiang is currently very stable. Both sides in Beitashan are still in confrontation. The main peak of the mountain is now in the hands of the national army. The national army in Xinjiang is strong, and there is no military problem. The Beitashan incident will not turn into a more serious incident. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang issue is a national issue. If relations between China and the Soviet Union can improve, everything will have a positive impact, not just the Xinjiang issue. Zhang said that he is collecting materials to study the China-Soviet issue. Zhang refused to express his opinion on Vice President Sun's recent remarks on China's foreign policy, only saying that China's current problems are part of the world's problems. China's foreign policy is independent and autonomous, and the relationship between China's situation and the world situation cannot be denied. Regarding the Yining issue, Zhang said: "The Yining people oppose Maswood's leadership in Xinjiang and hope that I will stay in office. In fact, there is no reason to oppose Maswood. Maswood's prestige, learning, and his history of struggle should make him the leader of Xinjiang. The central government will not change the decree that has already been issued because of what is involved in trust. If the Yining people insist, we will consider the next step. The so-called Turkestan movement is an independence movement, but Xinjiang does not have enough conditions for independence, and only the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay support this movement. The remaining seven districts, which account for more than 80% of the total population, support the central government. The central government's orders cannot reach only the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay. A reporter asked: "Is the Yining rebellion led by Akhmetjan?" Zhang replied: "Akhmetjan was the vice-chairman supported by the Yining people after the reorganization of the Xinjiang provincial government and was later appointed by the central government." A reporter asked: "Is it true that Akhmetjan is a Soviet citizen, as rumored?" Zhang replied: "Yining borders the Soviet Union, and this statement cannot be verified." Zhang said that there is no communist party activity in Xinjiang, even if there is, it is secret. Zhang denied that he was one of the candidates for the ambassador to the Soviet Union being considered by Chairman Chiang, and his return date has not been determined. Finally, Zhang said that in the future, to solve the Xinjiang problem, we should base ourselves on democracy, give the people freedom, abolish the past policies that harmed the people, make the high-pressure methods of the Sheng Shicai era a historical relic, and create a peaceful, democratic, and happy Xinjiang.</p>

<h3>Zhang Attends Welcome Meeting; Encourages Sincere Cooperation to Give Play to the Three Powers</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun City All Sectors Welcome Tea Party was held at the Lizhi Society at 2:30 PM on the 22nd. President Zhang first took the stage to deliver a speech, saying that the trip to the Northeast was planned long ago. Now, due to busy official duties, he cannot stay long, but the central government is always paying attention to our Northeast, especially Changchun, an important city on the front line of the war. In fact, the safety of the Northeast does not understand the relationship with our country, but also the relationship with the world, so the various sectors in this place should understand this situation. Local people are finally promoting civil rights, government personnel should exercise political power well, maintain law and order, and the army that defends the country should give full play to military power. All aspects must be integrated into one and cooperate seamlessly. The first purpose of this trip is to examine the implementation of the central government's policies in the local area and whether there are any inconsistencies in the local implementation. Therefore, it is hoped that the attendees can speak frankly and truthfully, and if there is anything that needs to be handled by the central government, it will be handled after returning to Beijing. After the meeting, President Zhang inspected the city appearance for an hour and flew back to Shenyang at about 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] President Zhang told the press: "I have read the editorials of various newspapers as soon as I arrived in Changchun, one of which is titled 'Listen more, see more, say more, and do more'." President Zhang said that he will naturally make efforts in doing more in the future, but he is also willing to listen more and see more, so as to understand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] President Zhang attended the welcome tea party for all sectors in Changchun City on the afternoon of the 22nd. After Chairman Liang Huasheng gave a brief speech, President Zhang stood up and spoke with great excitement. He encouraged many times. After listening to the statements of people from all walks of life, he gave a 30-minute speech. He first said: "The government not only attaches importance to the Northeast militarily, but also politically and economically. Strengthening the military can be explained by the fact that Chief of Staff Chen also serves as the Director of the Northeast Executive Yuan. The fact that a large number of soldiers and weapons have been replenished in recent months is enough to prove it. Therefore, the Northeast must have politics and economy that can match the military in the future, so that the government can realize its wish to 'recover the Northeast' and 'build the Northeast'." Then he said: "The difficulty in exporting soybeans in the Northeast has been obtained from this trip to the Northeast, and a thorough method of improvement will be studied after returning to Beijing. As for the currency system inside and outside the customs, the issue of the legal tender going out of the customs is still worth considering, because although the price index in the Northeast is also increasing day by day, there are still differences compared with inside the customs." Zhang Yuanwei said at the end: "We not only have the determination to eliminate the communist bandits, but also the determination to build a healthy and happy Northeast, so that the Northeast, which has been suffering for fifty years, will become the base of a strong China and the paradise of the Three Principles of the People."</p>

<h3>Shenyang City Election is Enthusiastic; Celebrities are Busy Cheering</h3>

<h3>Those with More Than Two Voting Rights Should Identify One</h3>
<p>It is reported that the scope of voters participating in regional or professional women's organizations in the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators is as follows: The National Professional and Women's National Election Office has clearly stipulated as follows: Anyone who has more than two voting rights in accordance with the Election and Recall Law should declare it when registering in the voter registration list. If the election authorities in charge discover that a voter has two or more voting rights during the investigation and registration of the voter registration list, they should also order them to identify one. All voters of organizations in the textile industry and women's organizations should be identified by the individuals themselves. The right to vote should never be identified by the organization to which they belong, nor can it be identified by the entire membership in a meeting to prevent military elections and prevent abuses. As for those voters of professional women's organizations who did not declare when registering in the voter registration list, they will also be regarded as participating in the election of professional or women's organizations. The above regulations have also been usually transferred to the election offices of various provinces and cities to be followed.</p>

<h3>Problems of Subsidies for Posts, Telecommunications, and Railways; The Ministry of Communications Decides to Convene Another Meeting; A Specific Method is Prepared to Submit to the Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] According to government regulations, subsidies for state-owned enterprises will be completely stopped from October 1, except for a very few. The most relevant of these are the posts, telecommunications, and railways under the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications previously convened a meeting of relevant departments to discuss this matter and requested that the cancellation of subsidies be temporarily postponed. Now, with less than ten days before the deadline, everything needs to be decided urgently. The Ministry of Communications is convening a meeting of relevant parties to discuss and propose concrete measures before the Executive Yuan meeting. It is reported that the following principles will be used to propose measures separately during the discussion: 1. If all subsidies are cancelled, how should the prices of various state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Communications be adjusted? 2. If the government continues to subsidize state-owned enterprises, what will the prices be? 3. If the amount of subsidies increases or decreases, how should the prices be adjusted? So that the Executive Yuan can be asked to discuss.</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Yuan Discusses the Treatment of Civil Servants; Advocates Issuing Salaries According to the Index; Pushes Yu Shude, etc. to Propose Concrete Measures</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The problem of improving the treatment of civil servants was discussed again at the conversation meeting of the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, and further decisions were made. The main purpose is to achieve the equality of survival advocated by Sun Yat-sen, so that superiors and subordinates can share weal and woe. The following decisions were made in principle at today's meeting: 1. The current cost of living index has risen to more than 50,000 times before the war, that is, according to the official statistics, it has risen to 31,000 times, while the civil servants are still paid according to 1,600 times, which is unreasonable. However, if calculated according to 30,000 times or 50,000 times, the national treasury cannot afford it. However, it is estimated that 30 yuan was enough for ordinary civil servants to cover one month's expenses before the war. If this 30 yuan can be distributed universally regardless of superiors or subordinates according to the cost of living index, it can solve the minimum living needs. Those above 30 yuan will be paid according to the current standard to show the difference in work. 2. If the above method is difficult to implement, it will be issued according to half of 31,000 times, that is, 15,000 times. If the implementation of these two methods is difficult, in order to make the upper and lower levels uniformly plan, the following two methods seem feasible:</p>
<h3>It is Proposed that the Government Be Responsible for the Education of Civil Servants' Children</h3>
<p>Rice, rice, oil, salt, medicine, housing, and children's education are all borne by the government; in addition, a "pocket money" is given. The physical and welfare benefits enjoyed by ministers and section members are not light, only the pocket money is slightly higher. 2. Implement the distribution system according to the British method, but this method is not easy to implement. At the end of the meeting, it was decided to push the three members, Yu Shude, Wan Can, and Li Shijun, to jointly draft a draft, and then submit it at the next meeting.</p>

<h3>Three American Soldiers Raped a Teenage Girl in Qingdao, US Military Police Handle the Case Lightly</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao, 22nd dispatch] Zhang Lihua, a 17-year-old girl from Changzhou, worked as a waitress at the Daxing Hotel on Nanhai Road to support her parents. On her way home from work the night before last, she was dragged to the side of the road near Fushan Road by three American soldiers, who gagged her mouth with cloth and took turns raping her. It was late at night and quiet, but fortunately, several patrolling police officers from Wendeng Road discovered the incident and rescued Zhang Lihua, who was barely breathing. After the police captured the three American soldiers, they were escorted to the US Military Police Headquarters. Fearing that the incident would escalate, the US Military Police ordered the three American soldiers to pay 20 US dollars and strongly urged Zhang Lihua to accept it. After Zhang received the money, the US Military Police announced that the case was over, and the three American soldiers were said to be confined for four days.</p>
<h3>China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and India are Preparing to Negotiate Aviation Agreements, Sino-Japanese Aviation is in Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] Ling Shifen, advisor to the Ministry of Communications, said on the 22nd regarding the situation of China's civil aviation negotiations with various countries: China-UK and China-US civil aviation negotiations have been completed, and negotiations currently in preparation include China-Philippines, China-Netherlands, and China-India. China and the Philippines already have a temporary agreement, which has now expired, and the two sides are seeking to conclude a new agreement and have made some compromises. Recently, our government has issued instructions to the embassy in the Philippines on this matter. Regarding the location of the negotiations, our side suggested holding them in China, or they may be linked. As for China-India negotiations, they could have started earlier, but they were repeatedly delayed due to internal turmoil in India and are difficult to implement in the short term. However, before the new agreement is signed, the original method will still be valid. Regarding Sino-Japanese navigation, air navigation is in progress, while sea navigation will depend on future trade conditions.</p>
<h3>The People of Tongguan are Extremely Stable, Residents in the Suburbs are Busy with the Autumn Harvest and Not Alarmed at All, Culverts and Bridges Between Wenxiang and Xin'an are Damaged by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Tongguan, 22nd dispatch] A reporter traveled from Xi'an along the Longhai Railway to Huayin on the 21st, and on the 22nd, he accompanied the army alone to a certain military base in Shaanxi and Henan to visit a certain senior commander. He also accompanied them to inspect the front line only 1,000 meters away from the Communist bandit-occupied area. In the evening, he returned to Tongguan. Along the way, the National Army was well-equipped, morale was high, and they were waiting in formation. Since the Communist bandits were defeated in Taiyugou on the 15th and gathered their remnants, many bandit soldiers have been pressed into battle. Now, many people have surrendered with weapons. Our air force cooperated with the ground National Army to launch counterattacks for days, and the prelude to the great battle in western Henan has begun. Residents in the suburbs of Tongguan are currently busy with the autumn harvest and are not alarmed at all. The market is normal, and the people are stable, which is even better than Xi'an. The Communist bandits in western Henan have thoroughly destroyed the culverts and bridges east of Wenxiang to Xin'an, and have also erected the rails and burned them with sleepers. The extent of the loss can be said to be unprecedented.</p>

<p>[Our Qingdao, 22nd dispatch] Qi Dazhi, Director of the Qingdao Seaport Quarantine Station of the Ministry of Health, and his wife, Wu Hengzhen, were recently reported for corruption by all the employees under his command to the Qingdao City Council. They listed crimes such as privately engraving seals to collect the salaries and allowances of all personnel from the national treasury, embezzling the national treasury, fabricating names to steal and sell relief supplies and medicines for personal gain, and depositing the daily income of the station in a private bank, withdrawing it in the name of Wu Hengzhen, and purchasing cars and bungalows for personal property.

<h3>Xinjiang Problem and General Zhang Zhizhong</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent situation in Xinjiang, since General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, gave a concise report to the Kuomintang Central Party and State Joint Conference on the 11th of this month, the people of the country should have understood the true picture and the crux of the so-called Xinjiang problem. Coincidentally, Burhan, a member of the National Government Committee from Xinjiang, and Muhammad Emin, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, flew from Dihua to Nanjing to pay respects to the central government. On the 21st, Burhan told reporters in Nanjing that there are no major problems in Xinjiang at present, and some problems are expected to be resolved peacefully. He will also suggest to the government that Xinjiang should always be a territory of the Republic of China. Burhan is from Tacheng, Xinjiang. He studied in Germany in his early years and is proficient in various languages ​​such as Chinese, Uyghur, Russian, and German. He has written many works. When General Zhang Zhizhong presided over Xinjiang, he served as the Deputy Governor of the province. In April of this year, when the National Government was reorganized, he was elected as a member of the National Government Committee, representing the virtuous people of society. Emin is a student who studied in his own country, is familiar with Islamic culture, and is proficient in Turkish, Indian, English, and Uyghur languages. He once worked for the central government. Both of them are enlightened figures in Xinjiang Province. Now, when the Xinjiang issue has reached a turning point, they traveled together to Nanjing and made important suggestions to the central government, which seems to imply the bright future of the Xinjiang issue, and the turmoil in the western border is expected to gradually disappear. In fact, looking at it from a longer perspective, we are not yet allowed to be so optimistic today.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is a province of the Republic of China, a remote and desolate place, but it is rich in resources and strategically important. The emergence of Xinjiang as a problem seems on the surface to be intricate and complex, involving diplomatic problems, religious problems, social problems, ethnic problems, etc., intertwined and unclear. In reality, the Xinjiang problem is quite simple. With his two years of experience in governing Xinjiang, General Zhang Zhizhong pointed out that the Xinjiang problem is an intertwining of diplomatic and ethnic problems. To solve this problem in the future, we should take a two-pronged approach of ethnicity and diplomacy, and the most fundamental thing is to actively promote the Principle of People's Livelihood and complete the construction of Xinjiang. Zhang's few words may sound like clichés, but they are actually very insightful and practical.</p>
<p>Let us unfold the map of Xinjiang and look around: on the edge of the Pamir Plateau, from the Pyanj River to Zirgos (located west of Yili, the border point after the Qing Emperor repeatedly lost territory to Ningguo), to Habar Asu (north of Tacheng), Ulegey, and then from Ulegey southeast to Hatori, there is a long and winding border line of thousands of miles. Beyond this line, the vast desert is a sea of red. There are strict administrations, organized business groups and cultural groups, constantly extending outwards and pressing outwards with a sense of "security," which has led to serious diplomatic problems.</p>
<p>The second is the ethnic problem. Xinjiang has a population of 4.3 million, of which about 4 million are Muslims with a unique religious culture. The more than 4 million people each have their own customs, languages ​​and scripts. The Uyghur population is larger, followed by the Kazakhs, and the Uyghurs and Kazakhs are also incompatible with each other, with political ups and downs, which forms a serious ethnic problem. Due to the misgovernment of the local authorities in Xinjiang in the past, bloody conflicts have occurred among the ethnic groups many times, so the ethnic problem is even more connected with the diplomatic problem, and the Yining rebellion occurred in September 1945.</p>
<p>The Yili Incident was mainly led by the Kazakhs, and the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan all fell. At this time, it was the end of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to strive for domestic peace, the central government sent General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang to deal with the situation and held eight negotiations with Yili, and a peace agreement was reached. On July 1st last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government was reorganized according to the peace terms, and Yili participated in the provincial government with six committee members. In May of this year, Masud was ordered to be the Chairman of Xinjiang, and the Baitashan Incident broke out soon after. Before the Baitashan Incident was resolved, a separatist movement occurred in the Xinjiang provincial government. First, the senators of the three districts of Yitaa refused to attend the Provincial Senate, and then Vice Chairman Ahmetjan and Committee Member and Deputy Director Lai Ximujiang resigned. General Zhang Zhizhong recently sent an open letter to Ah Lai, sternly questioning whether he wanted to unilaterally tear up the peace agreement? Was there going to be another armed rebellion? Or was he willing to return to Dihua for sincere discussions? As of now, there has been no response from Yili. Fortunately, the relationship between Dihua and Yili can still be maintained, and there is no sign of complete rupture. However, General Zhang Zhizhong, representing the central government, has been holding a policy of step-by-step concession, but this unresolved problem has not been solved, and the night is still long and full of dreams.</p>
<p>General Zhang Zhizhong has ambitions and insights in governing Xinjiang. We believe that he must have steps to deal with the Yili issue. The trip to Nanjing by Burhan and Emin further shows that among the more than 4 million people in Xinjiang, more than 3 million recognize the central government and support the central government. Only 700,000 people in the three districts of Yitaa, under the separatist conspiracy of a few ambitious people, are engaged in fierce political struggles with Dihua. Looking at the trend, the diplomatic and ethnic problems of Xinjiang are no longer local problems, and it is almost impossible to find solutions within Xinjiang Province. The central government may accept the new suggestions of Zhang and Burhan, and with extreme tolerance and wisdom, reopen the door for peaceful negotiations on the Xinjiang issue. We very much agree with the principle of "peaceful unification, democracy and freedom." Only by jointly adhering to the grand goal of peaceful unification, democracy and freedom can we unite the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and then use the strength of ethnic unity to work hard on economic construction and seek stability in Xinjiang. However, no matter how much we wish for this, are the few ambitious people willing to give up their mentality of relying on foreign aid and work together for the construction and stability of Xinjiang? Finally, let us try to broaden our horizons further. The Xinjiang problem is almost a microcosm of the overall situation in China, and the stalemate in China's negotiations with the Soviet Union and the ultimate rebellion of the Communist bandits can almost be seen as a microcosm of the unsolvable disputes in the global situation. The Xinjiang problem is probably not easy to completely solve well at present. However, in any case, we must do our best to work hard, and senior officials who have been entrusted with important responsibilities in one area, such as General Zhang Zhizhong, should return to defend and sit in northern Xinjiang as soon as possible, so as to stabilize Xinjiang and win the hearts of the people in Shaanxi and Gansu.</p>

<h3>British Representative Reviews World Situation, Sternly Condemns Soviet Attitude, Hopes Soviet Union Will Change Course and Save Peace</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Broadcast from Lake Success on the 22nd: Today, British Minister of State Mr. McNeil, the chief representative attending the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech to the assembly, 2,600 words long, clarifying the basic policies of the United Kingdom. It stated that if the Soviet Union continues to force its will upon the countries of the world, world peace will collapse, causing serious consequences. He criticized the Soviet Union sternly, but still hoped that the Soviet Union would change its attitude. Mr. McNeil dismissed as absurd Vyshinsky's claim that the United States has a tendency to instigate war. He strongly denied Vyshinsky's claim that the Marshall Plan for European economic aid threatens the sovereignty of European countries, and pointed out that the Soviet Union deliberately hindered the passage of the atomic energy control plan and used its veto power ten times. Mr. McNeil's speech touched on all aspects of the world political situation, but his main argument was to condemn the Soviet Union's uncompromising attitude and the serious impact of this attitude on world peace. Mr. McNeil also said that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London in November this year will be the last hope for restoring peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 22nd] Britain today joined the United States in publicly criticizing the Soviet Union for undermining the United Nations. Austin, in his first official reply to the Soviet Union, bluntly accused Vyshinsky of lying by calling the United States a "war monger," and said that Vyshinsky's speech at the General Assembly was a slanderous and provocative lie. British representative McNeil, following Austin's lead, will deliver a speech at the General Assembly to "shatter" the Soviet Union's arguments accusing Britain and the United States of being war mongers and undermining the United Nations. Mr. McNeil will review the entire situation of the United Nations, and, like Marshall, will completely blame the Soviet Union for the current paralysis.</p>
<h3>Amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty Added to UN General Assembly Agenda, China, Britain and Other Allied Nations Abstain, Soviet Union and Poland Vote Against</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] The Steering Committee of the General Assembly today passed by a vote of four to two to add the amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty to the agenda for discussion by the General Assembly. The United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil voted in favor, and the Soviet Union and Poland voted against. Eight countries, including China and Britain, abstained. The proposal was put forward by Argentina. British representative Shawcross said during the discussion that the British government believes that it is unwise for the General Assembly to discuss the amendment of the Italian Peace Treaty at this time. The British government has always believed that the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty are not entirely satisfactory, but it is very doubtful whether it is appropriate to amend it at this time. Although the United Kingdom does not oppose the proposal, it does not seem to be able to support it. Polish representative Ransan Lian told the meeting that the General Assembly's immediate discussion of the amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty would dangerously hinder the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The Allied countries would therefore allow Germany and Japan to sign peace treaties with extremely strong reservations. The Italian Peace Treaty has only been ratified for one week, and the General Assembly's discussion of its amendment is a great encouragement to Germany and Japan. Syrian representative Koli advocated that the Security Council should quickly recommend Italy's accession to the United Nations. After joining, Italy would have the opportunity to request an amendment to the treaty. Soviet representative Gromyko said that the United States did not express any intention to amend the treaty when negotiating the Italian Peace Treaty, and the United States' sudden change of attitude did not surprise the Soviet Union. This move by the United States would make it impossible for the Allied countries to cooperate more easily when negotiating peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Argentina's proposal suggested that countries that signed the Italian Peace Treaty should give Italy the opportunity to put forward new opinions to reduce the obligations imposed on Italy by the treaty.</p>
<h3>Steering Committee Passes Soviet Proposal to Add to Agenda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing, 21st] After clarifying that the General Assembly has full authority to discuss any issues related to international security and peace, the Steering Committee of the General Assembly today unanimously passed the Soviet proposal to add to the agenda the case of the General Assembly adopting countermeasures to stop the propaganda and instigation of another war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch] The Steering Committee then quickly passed two Yugoslav proposals with the following content: To prevent the dissemination of defamatory reports against foreign countries, so as to harm international friendship and violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations organization. To ensure the extradition of war criminals, traitors and puppets to the victimized countries.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Secretary Jones Flies to New York to Attend Discussion on Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] British Colonial Secretary Jones is scheduled to fly to New York today to attend the General Assembly meeting and present Britain's views during the debate on the Palestine issue. The British government's position has been decided by the cabinet at a special meeting on Friday. It is expected that Jones will declare that if the United Nations organization has no new proposals, Britain is prepared to hand over the trusteeship of the Holy Land and withdraw its troops from the area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] Foreign Office officials declared today: After Britain submitted the Palestine issue to the General Assembly, it is willing to accept the partition plan for Palestine, but will insist that other member states assist in fulfilling this task. This point is recognized as the future position of the British government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Arab League representative declared today: If the United Nations wants to partition Palestine, the Arab countries will implement economic and cultural sanctions against Europe and the United States.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Spokesman Criticizes Romanian and Bulgarian Governments, Also Issues Warning to Hungary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesman today criticized the Bulgarian and Romanian governments for not being able to represent their countries, saying that if these countries violate the principles of the peace treaty again, they will constitute a crime against European civilization. His attack on Hungary was lighter, believing that there were many Communists in the country and their power was disproportionate, and said, "The lessons of Romania and Bulgaria should be a warning to the Hungarians."</p>
<h3>France Willing to Act as Mediator to Eliminate Differences Between the United States and the Soviet Union, President and Prime Minister Call for Peace in Speeches</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Since Marshall and Vyshinsky had a head-on conflict at the General Assembly meeting, French people have been fearing that a new war will break out again. The words of French President Auriol and Prime Minister Ramadier also reflect this mentality. Both of them stressed that France will continue to work hard to reconcile the opinions of the East and the West. They also declared that the peace treaty with Germany should ensure that France has security guarantees, and France should have preferential rights over Germany in economic reconstruction. Auriol said that he earnestly hopes that the powerful countries guiding world affairs can assume the highest responsibility and bring peace to the world. If peace cannot be achieved among the powerful countries, and the armed fear that will inevitably lead to war continues to be maintained, it will be a terrible mockery of the fate of mankind. Prime Minister Ramadier also said that Europe does not exclude any country, and recognizes that both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are part of Europe. The table in Europe is a round table, which allows all countries in Eastern and Western Europe to sit at the same table in a completely equal position. He continued, the foundation of peace is now threatened, and if peace is not guaranteed, nothing will be achieved. The diverse interpretations within the country caused by French Foreign Minister Bidault's speech at the General Assembly reflect the fact that most of the French people are unwilling to be forced to definitely participate in the ranks of either the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Government Announces Basic Policy Towards the Netherlands, Foreign Minister Wang Meets With Sjahrir</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 22nd] Radio Yogyakarta announced: The Indonesian cabinet held a meeting for three days under the chairmanship of President Sukarno, and announced on the night of the 22nd the basic policy of the Republic towards the Netherlands, the main points of which are as follows: The Indonesian cabinet has decided to eliminate the unrest and disorder caused by the Dutch military's invasion of Indonesian territory; The cabinet is determined to maintain peace and order, as well as the freedom of action of the Indonesian people; Post-war reconstruction work on the islands will continue, regardless of whether there is assistance from the Dutch side; Foreign relations will be strengthened.</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Republic, the Republic will use these points as a standard to cooperate with the rest of the world on the basis of equality. If the Dutch are willing to accept the above promises, peace talks can begin immediately. This conflict was initiated by the Dutch side, and the Indonesian government has no intention of continuing the state of conflict. The spokesman also said that before peace negotiations begin, the Dutch military must withdraw from the territory occupied by its so-called police action. The Indonesian army is prepared to take over as soon as the Dutch military withdraws.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie today. It is learned that Foreign Minister Ren Wang reiterated during the half-hour conversation the Chinese policy of following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of Asian independence. Wang emphasized to Sjahrir the necessity for the Indonesian Republic to provide effective protection for the lives and property of overseas Chinese within its borders. Sjahrir will go to London tonight, and then to Singapore, before returning to Java. His planned trip to Nanjing was cancelled after he visited Foreign Minister Wang today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] The United Nations Consular Investigation Team issued a communiqué today, stating that the team has decided to immediately submit an interim report to the Security Council on the supervision of the implementation of the ceasefire order by the Dutch and Indonesia, and hopes to complete its work around the end of September.</p>
<h3>Truman and Cabinet Members Begin Consultations, Marshall Returns to Washington Posthaste, Opinions Differ on Convening Special Session of Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman held a meeting with three cabinet members today to discuss the two urgent issues of increasing aid to Europe and balancing domestic prices.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Marshall took time out from New York tonight to return here to meet with President Truman tomorrow afternoon to discuss world political and economic issues and decide on countermeasures for major issues.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman discovered on the 21st that his senior advisers had sharp divisions of opinion on current serious issues, namely whether to convene a special session of Congress to deal with the increasingly serious domestic and foreign economic crises. Administration officials said that the president would be forced to reach a "gentleman's agreement" with Republican congressional leaders before taking any action. For this reason, Truman's subordinates are all strongly opposed to convening a special session of Congress unless it is a last resort. It is said that the authorities suggested that the Republican-controlled Congress is very likely to reject the group leader to stop the high domestic prices and the European famine problem. On the other hand, the Secretary of State expressed that this emergency action is necessary to save Europe. If the Congress of the War is not convened, the necessary expedient aid policy cannot be implemented.</p>
<h3>Economic Conference of 16 European Countries, Representatives Sign Report, Needs US Aid of $16 Billion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The Economic Cooperation Conference of 16 European countries has been held for ten weeks. This afternoon, representatives went to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to sign the report, which is 20,000 words long. It lists the resources, self-help procedures of Western and Southern Europe, and, based on the needs of US Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European economic recovery, suggests that the United States should provide aid of $16.295 billion in the next four years. A British Air Force special plane is now on standby to transport the report to Washington. According to people attending the meeting, the budget for income and expenditure from 1948 to 1951 is as follows: The 16 European countries must import food, raw materials, and production equipment totaling $35 billion. $15 billion can be offset by exports or other means. The shortage totals $19.689 billion, of which $3.394 billion will be borrowed from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the remaining $16.295 billion should be provided by the United States. All representatives are uneasy about the outcome of the report. The final decision on this matter rests with the US Congress, and the US Congress may not be able to discuss it until next spring, but it is hoped that the United States can design temporary aid measures.</p>
<h3>Egypt to Expand Military, Workers Hold Anti-British and American Demonstrations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 21st] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy addressed the Saadi Party he founded after returning to the country from the United States yesterday, saying that Egypt's top priority at present is to strengthen its military strength to cope with any contingencies. He said that he had talked too much in the past, and from now on he should work hard to defend the country.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 21st] More than a thousand workers from the Egyptian Army Factory demonstrated to the Prime Minister's Office today because the Security Council had not made a decision on Egypt's request, chanting "Down with Britain and the United States" and "Down with China, France and Brazil" for failing to support Egypt in the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Incapable of War in Next 25 Years, Observations of Mr. Reppsche</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Mr. Reppsche, director of the Soviet Union Department of the State Department, told reporters today that the Soviet Union's industry is incapable of preparing for war against the United States for at least 25 years. This weakness may extend to 50 years, and we do not need to worry about the Soviet Union as a potential enemy. Mr. Reppsche has been studying the Soviet Union for 24 years and said that the Soviet Union is using all its strength to build heavy industry, especially steel, railways, and farm implements. Light industry accounts for only one-third of its post-war recovery plan. Mr. Reppsche did not mention how the Soviet Union's satellite countries and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany supply the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Some US Officials Stationed in Japan Advocate That Japan Should Have a Large-Scale Merchant Fleet, Claimed That the Minimum Livelihood of the Japanese Cannot Be Maintained Without This</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Several US officials here said that Japan should be allowed to have a fairly large-scale merchant fleet to achieve the living standards stipulated by the Allied countries. Japan itself cannot produce enough products and cannot obtain goods from foreign countries. Therefore, if Japan needs to achieve the minimum standard of living, it should have a good merchant fleet. An Allied official said: "If Japan can have a merchant fleet, it can increase its national income and make up for the shortcomings that exist between its necessities and the gains from its small export trade." If Japan encourages travel and trade to Japan, operates a "merchant fleet," and transports raw materials from abroad, it can establish its foreign assets. An Allied official said that Japan currently has 777 iron-hulled ships of more than 100 tons, with a total tonnage of more than one million tons. In 1939, Japan had a total tonnage of 5,629,845 tons. Since 1927, the tonnage of Japanese ships has been more than 4 million tons.</p>
<h3>Iranian Parliament Opens Fierce Debate on Transfer of Oil Rights to Soviet Union, Opposition Party Accuses Negotiations of Being Illegal</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 21st] The Iranian Parliament today questioned whether the oil rights negotiations conducted by Iranian Prime Minister Saltaneh in Moscow last year were legal, on the grounds that the Prime Minister did not receive a vote of confidence in the previous parliament. This is the first time the new parliament has mentioned passing the Soviet oil rights issue. Parliamentarian Aiteber accused the Prime Minister of not being a representative of the people and having no right to negotiate on behalf of the people. Mr. Aiteber is a powerful independent opposition in parliament, advocating that Iran review the oil rights enjoyed by another foreign country (referring to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). Saltaneh and others were present during the debate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 22nd] Foreign observers said that if the opposition continues to attack before the oil case is submitted to the parliament, Prime Minister Saltaneh may submit his resignation.</p>
<h3>Export Products to Japan – Implementation of Different Exchange Rate System – Large Quantities of Soviet Goods Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) It has been learned that, in order to remedy the high cost of Japanese export goods, the Allied Headquarters is implementing a plan to apply different exchange rates to various goods. According to Jabby, an Indian merchant who was among the first to arrive in Japan, the different exchange rates for US dollars to Japanese yen range from 120-130 yen to over 250 yen per US dollar (the current official exchange rate set by the military government is 50 yen per US dollar). This move attempts to encourage buyers to purchase more Japanese goods and to provide Japanese exporters with a better opportunity to compete in the world market.</p>
<p>(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) The Allied Headquarters announced that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to exchange 100 wooden tugboats and 75 barges for 25,000 tons of coking coal has officially taken effect. The Allied Headquarters stated that 1,500 metric tons of vulcanized pulp will be shipped from Sakhalin to Japan this week for use in manufacturing export paper. The Soviet Union has also sold 4,000 metric tons of graphite to Japan for use in manufacturing high-grade steel.</p>
<h3>More Japanese War Suspects Released</h3>
<p>(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) The Legal Section of the Allied Headquarters announced on the 22nd that in the five weeks before September 1st, 51 Japanese war suspects were arrested and detained in Sugamo Prison, while another 157 suspects were released or transferred for trial. Among those released were Major General Soji Yamagami and Rear Admiral Tsugu Naoshi, former commander of the Philippine Naval Base, all released due to lack of evidence.</p>

<h3>Fourth Session of the Municipal Council Opens – Speaker Presents Three Points – Austerity Movement Has Reached an Inevitable Stage</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The fourth session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council officially opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Council's location on Tanggu Road. 146 councilors were in attendance, with Mayor Wu, bureau chiefs, and other party, government, and military leaders, along with chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, district保長 (bao zhang, local heads), and dozens of others present as observers. At the opening ceremony, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating: "The first general assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council was held in September of last year, and a year has now passed. In the past year, although we have not made many suggestions and contributions to municipal facilities, we have more or less fulfilled our responsibility to represent the citizens, increase their welfare, and reduce their suffering. At the same time, we have also considered the needs of the municipal government, hoping to do as much as possible under poor economic conditions." The speaker also mentioned that the current situation is at a critical juncture, and that the high prices in the city are related to the overall situation. The Mid-Autumn Festival is also approaching, and prices tend to fluctuate during this period. Therefore, this session is also very important. Although the session is short, we must do our best to contribute our opinions on local political and social trends, as well as the overall national situation.</p>
<p>Finally, he put forward three suggestions based on his personal thoughts: "The municipal government's budget for the 37th year of the Republic [1948] must be submitted during this session. If we wait until the next session in December, it will be too late to submit it to the central government for approval. Therefore, we hope that the municipal government will expedite the preparation of the budget for the next year without increasing the burden on citizens or hindering the work of the municipal government. The council should also review it as soon as possible. The austerity movement should be actively promoted. Looking at the current situation in Shanghai, it is a great crisis. The four supervisory committee members who came to Shanghai to investigate last time expressed their feeling that the extravagance of a few people in Shanghai caused the majority to be unable to live. This statement is worth paying attention to. At the same time, Shanghai is an international city, and foreigners coming to Shanghai often express that China is asking for loans from foreign countries, so why not raise funds from the people of Shanghai themselves? Therefore, the austerity movement has reached a stage where it must be implemented. The central government has not yet determined the status of municipalities directly under the central government. The constitution only states that the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government will be "separately defined by law." Therefore, we hope that the council will study the autonomous status of municipalities directly under the central government as much as possible and contribute to the central government based on Shanghai's past experience in local autonomy." In addition, he also reported that, as a result of the joint efforts of the municipal government and the council, the central government has given satisfactory answers to the return of enemy and puppet-occupied civil land and property and the organization of a joint power plant, and has sent personnel to begin handling the matter.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Predicts and Warns – "The Next Three Months Will Be Even More Difficult" – "Stability" Is the Most Needed at Present</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating: "I said earlier that 1947 would be the most difficult year, but the next three months will be even more difficult. In the past, Shanghai experienced gold rushes, student movements, and other incidents. Fortunately, with the assistance of the Municipal Council, the Party Headquarters, and other relevant parties, we were able to get through them safely. We hope that the next few months will also pass smoothly. However, the most needed thing for Shanghai at present is 'stability.' As for 'stability,' the first is to abide by the law and discipline. Otherwise, difficulties in various matters such as transportation, public security, etc., cannot be resolved. The second is to practice austerity. Austerity can increase production and reduce the use of foreign exchange. The trend of extravagance must be overthrown. We hope that the council will assist in establishing a good social atmosphere."</p>
<p>Councilor Zhan Wen, as a representative of the councilors, also expressed that the council should assist the government in stabilizing society.

<h3>Policy Address</h3>
<p>At the first meeting of the fourth session of the Municipal Council, Mayor Wu reported on the administration of the city. In addition to the written report, the mayor also orally elaborated on important points: Regarding civil affairs: the conscription problem is the most important. The central government has stipulated that 3,000 volunteer soldiers should be recruited, which can be completed by the end of this month. Approximately 120,000 people have applied for exemption from military service, and they are currently being reviewed separately. In order to encourage the city's young men to actively enlist, a consolation association has been jointly organized in each district. Police: Fire prevention work is very important, especially since the communists are inciting citizens to commit arson, which should be guarded against. However, the equipment costs are enormous, which is the most difficult thing. Even so, many improvements have already been made. The police pay is too low, and I have tried many times to find a solution, but without success. I hope the council will assist in formulating a uniform subsidy plan. Society: We have always spared no effort in managing prices, and we have tried our best to keep rice, oil, and food from rising. Most of the pork comes from Jiangbei. We are now doing our best to crack down on extortionate taxes, so the source is gradually becoming smoother. At the same time, we are also negotiating with the Central Trust of China to provide loans to meat merchants, so the price of meat has fallen. The Winter Relief Association is about to be established, and we hope that all sectors will provide assistance. Education: The municipal government is determined to handle the issue of collecting tuition fees, and the fee standards will be openly established by all relevant parties; 5.2 billion yuan has now been collected for scholarships for primary and secondary schools, which will be distributed uniformly by the unified committee; for universities, there will be economic canteens, etc. Finance: The main task now is to consolidate tax revenue. Public Works: The soaring prices of construction materials have made it extremely difficult to carry out projects. The seawall project is progressing smoothly. The Pudong Avenue is of great importance, and we hope to complete it. Public Utilities: There is currently a power crisis. Too little power is used in industry, and too much is used in store displays, which is a huge waste. The truck ferry across the river can be completed in October. Land Administration: Regarding the racecourse issue, because there is a legal basis, formal negotiations cannot be conducted. Only informal consultations are being adopted. The other party has now agreed to first study how much land they need there as a minimum before discussing the matter further. Health: The sanitation problem is the biggest.</p>
<h3>Just Discussing Soldiers' Treatment - Suddenly, Women's Cries Heard - Petitioning for Soldiers Occupying Houses Encountered Military Police Harassment and Assault</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Yesterday, before the first meeting of the Municipal Council adjourned at noon, while the treatment of soldiers was being hotly debated, a conflict occurred between military police and civilians downstairs, and a pregnant woman was kicked. It turned out that Lin Chunshui and others, representatives of six households living downstairs at No. 18, Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, came to the Council to petition. They stated that the residents of the building downstairs had a seven-year lease with the landlord, but on the 19th of last month, a soldier named Liu Jimin came and claimed that all the houses downstairs had been taken over by him, forcing them to move out. On the 22nd, Liu occupied the downstairs, forcibly moved the original residents' furniture and objects outside the door, and hung a sign on the door that read "Fourth Warehouse, Engineering Department, United Service Command." This matter has been going on for a month, and the original residents have nowhere to live, so they came to petition, and held a white cloth banner with the words "Soldiers forcibly occupy people's houses, and the common people have no houses to live in. Please uphold justice, Municipal Council." After hearing the news, the Council immediately appointed two councilors, Zhang Xuelian and Shi Zongde, to receive them. At this time, a young military policeman was carrying a large bundle of boots and passed by the area. Seeing the words "Soldiers forcibly occupy people's houses" written on the cloth, he immediately went forward to argue with the petitioners, saying that there were good and bad soldiers and that they should not be generalized, so he accused the petitioning representatives of insult. A conflict broke out immediately, and one of the pregnant women who was petitioning knelt on the ground and pleaded with him. The military policeman kicked her in the abdomen, causing the woman to cry and wail, which immediately aroused public outrage. People pointed out that the military policeman should not hit people, especially not kick a pregnant woman. At that time, several petitioners, together with the duty police officer of the Hongkou Branch, twisted him to the Council to report the incident. The police wanted to take him to the police station, but the military policeman said, "The police can't control the military police." The police officer said, "If you hit someone on the road, you are breaking the law, and this is within my authority." As a result, he was taken to the station to ask for instructions on how to deal with the matter.</p>

<p>(Our Report) The Municipal Council has recently received repeated complaints from citizens that the District Court often has a backlog of cases. Therefore, it has written to the District Court, requesting it to try its best to prevent cases from piling up for a long time. If it is necessary to delay the proceedings, it is hoped that the court will distinguish the importance and urgency of the cases and prioritize them accordingly in order to facilitate the people's lawsuits and protect their legal rights.</p>

<h3>Caohejing's Main Thoroughfare Blocked – Gentry Gather to Discuss Elimination</h3>
<p>Caohejing Guanshengyuan Road was widened from an existing highway in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] at the request of the former Caohejing District Municipal Committee to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and funds were raised locally to compensate landowners. At that time, Guanshengyuan donated the most money, so the local government requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to name it Guanshengyuan Road as a reward. Vehicle traffic has always been convenient, and this has lasted for fourteen years. Recently, however, the owner of the bridge abutment came forward to claim ownership and erected stakes and fences in the middle of the road, blocking vehicle traffic. Factories along the road have been greatly affected and have repeatedly reported to the police bureau for elimination, but they have been dismantled and reinstalled repeatedly, and the traffic situation remains blocked. Yesterday, Caohejing gentry Tang Puzhuang and Zhang Ruliang specially invited local city councilors, district chiefs,保長 (bao zhang, local heads), public officials, local gentry, factory representatives, and district people's representatives to a meeting to discuss the matter.

Tan, with a pale face, wiped away tears with a handkerchief while answering questions, confessing: "I am from Beijing. All the previous generations of the Tan family smoked opium. I started smoking when I was young, and it was my parents' fault. After marrying Tian Guozhen, I quit for a while, but later I had a miscarriage and suffered from stomach problems. I was weak and heard that smoking a few puffs would help." Subsequently, the presiding judge stood up and announced: "Tian Guozhen and Tan are guilty of drug use, violating the drug prohibition laws.

<h3>The Arrest of the Old Headmaster Who Defiled Female Students in Jiangyin – Jiang Ruzhen Attempted to Flee to Northern Jiangsu – His Alias Exposed While Obtaining Documents - Claimed to Have Been Framed by His Mistress</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Jiang Ruzhen, 55 years old, from Sanguan Township, Jiangyin, principal of Dewa Primary School on Xicang Road, Nanshi, was wanted by the District Court's Prosecutor's Office for repeatedly raping ten underage female students, including Zhu Yuexian, in June of this year. Jiang fled without a trace after the incident. It turned out that Jiang had been hiding in Zhang Jinhai's home in Sunjia Lane, Cangqian Bridge, his hometown of Jiangyin, several months ago. Zhang was his elder brother, but Jiang Ruzhen had been adopted out when he was young, so he no longer used the Zhang surname. After returning, Jiang planned to go to northern Jiangsu and secretly contacted Hu Qingsheng, the deputy head of Sanguan Township, through his brother, changing his name to Zhang Yinhai and asking him to help him obtain a national ID card. On the 18th of this month, Hu Qingsheng instructed the household registration clerk, Hu Bingyu, to quickly fill out a national ID card for Zhang. Hu saw that he looked flustered and checked the household registration book, but there was no Zhang Yinhai. He secretly informed the township head Hu, who, after investigation, learned that he had changed his name and that he was a wanted criminal. That evening at 10:00 PM, he sent the self-defense team to arrest Jiang. On the 19th, he was handed over to the county government. On the 20th, Magistrate Xu personally interrogated him. Jiang denied raping the female students, only admitting that Huade Primary School was founded by him by renting a house and land, and that he had put in a lot of hard work. Because the school was located near Zhu Hu's house, she was over 40 years old and her husband worked at the Wheel Bureau and only returned once a week. Her daughter, Yuexian, studied at Huade, and he often visited Zhu's house, and he developed an ambiguous relationship with Zhu. Because the Zhu family had a difficult life, he often provided economic assistance. Unexpectedly, Huade Primary School was suddenly converted back to green, and his hard work was destroyed. Because of economic difficulties, he asked</p>
<h3>Mid-Air SOS from Plane: Passengers Prepared to Parachute - Tokyo Flight a False Alarm</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Northwest Airlines "Shanghai" flight, which departed from America via Tokyo for Shanghai, sent an emergency SOS signal at 5:30 PM yesterday, when it was only 50 miles from Shanghai. The China Aviation Corporation (CAC) received the signal, reporting a fire onboard and a critical situation. The pilot had notified passengers to prepare to parachute and escape, requesting CAC to dispatch a rescue plane immediately.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the message, CAC immediately dispatched aircraft ○46, which took off at once. While in the air, they received another telegram from the "Shanghai" flight, stating that the fire had been extinguished and that everything was alright.</p>
<p>At that time, the CAC airport had already prepared fire trucks and ambulances, anticipating potential accidents during the "Shanghai" flight's landing. At 5:40 PM, the "Shanghai" flight landed slowly and safely. After the passengers hurriedly disembarked, the entire aircraft was thoroughly inspected. Not only was there no trace of fire in the passenger cabin, but the cargo hold was also completely normal.</p>
<p>According to the pilot, Bank, the plane's construction included an automatic fire alarm system in the cargo hold. In case of a fire, a red light in the cockpit would automatically illuminate. When the fire was extinguished, the light would automatically go off. Yesterday, while piloting the Shanghai flight 50 miles from Shanghai, he suddenly noticed the warning light in the front cargo hold illuminate. He immediately used the automatic fire extinguisher. Shortly after, the red light went off, indicating that everything was fine. Just as he was celebrating passing a critical moment, the red light in the rear cargo hold also illuminated. Although he used the automatic fire extinguisher again, it was ineffective. He was then forced to send an SOS signal and fly at a low altitude of 300 feet, notifying the passengers to prepare to parachute and escape. At this critical juncture, the warning light in the rear cargo hold also went off, finally putting his mind at ease. He ultimately landed at Longhua Airport. After repeated research and inspection by CAC mechanical personnel, it was discovered that the false alarm was due to a malfunction in the "automatic fire alarm light" itself, causing it to flicker on and off, while there was actually no fire.</p>
<p>There were eleven passengers aboard the flight to Shanghai yesterday, including Mrs. Zhu Shiming, who boarded the plane when it flew through Tokyo. According to accounts of the time, all the passengers on the plane remained calm. Two Filipino flight attendants, upon learning of the matter, could not help but burst out laughing.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Deadline for Donations Approaching End of Month</h3>

<p>[Our Dispatch] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has ordered the addition of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hankou-Xi'an route, which is scheduled to officially open today with three flights per week. The airport will temporarily borrow military airports in various locations. In addition, the company's planned Shanghai-San Francisco China-U.S. air route has been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Administration last week. It will be officially announced after President Truman signs it. CNAC is preparing to commence operations on the 3rd of next month.</p>
<h3>From the 25th: No Oil Supply</h3>
<p>It is also learned that CNAC has received notification from the oil company that there will be no oil supply from the 25th. The company has submitted its monthly oil requirements to the Import Management Committee, requesting that they be included in the import quota so that they can purchase oil from oil merchants at the listed market price in the future. If this problem cannot be resolved quickly, all routes may be forced to suspend operations after the 25th. Even if the Import Management Committee approves this request in the future, another serious problem may arise, namely that if the listed exchange rate changes, the oil price will inevitably rise accordingly.

<h3>First Shot in News Industry Rectification Campaign: Six Unscrupulous Reporters in the Capital Accused of Soliciting "Entertainment Fees"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd] Amidst the sounds of rectification in the news industry, the capital has taken concrete action to investigate unscrupulous reporters who extorted money under the guise of collecting fees. This matter was revealed in the newspapers on the 20th and has temporarily come to an end on the 22nd. People in the capital's news industry are paying close attention to this matter. It is said that the Reporters Association will soon make a decision, taking it as the first shot in the rectification campaign.</p>
<p>Recently, a resident of Nanjing, Liu Zhennan, committed suicide in front of the house of his enemy Lan Shichang. That afternoon, several reporters went to Lan's house to interview him, claiming that the reports in the newspapers did not match the facts and that Lan needed to provide entertainment fees to the news industry. They extorted 12 million yuan, which was eventually reduced to 3 million yuan. However, another reporter learned of this matter, and the Zongheng News Agency in the city issued a press release on the 19th, detailing the matter. The Central Daily News published it first on the 20th. The leaders of the Capital Reporters Association, the Capital Communications Industry Association, and various newspapers and news agencies in the city attached great importance to the matter and decided to send personnel to</p>
<p>Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 21st, seven major newspapers in the capital sent personnel to jointly investigate, and the truth was gradually revealed. The seven reporters who participated in the joint investigation were Hu Xiaoxian of the Central Daily News, Zhou Xiying of the Peace Daily News, Qian Shaofang of the New People's News, Zhang Gongdu of the Dagang News, Peng Yimin of the Social Daily News, Bai Yaoxi of the Construction Daily News, and Lu Xu of the Nanjing People's News. They were ordered to visit Lan's house on the 21st and invite the complainant to talk to them. They learned the entire story and collectively wrote a report that evening, which was published in various newspapers on the 22nd. According to the</p>
<p>Collective Report</p>
<p>The complainant was Lang Wenzong, a news provider for Zongheng News Agency. He said that a total of six reporters participated in the extortion. According to Lan's second daughter, five of them were Shi Shaofang, a reporter for the social news agency, Xia Qingyun, a reporter for the Construction Daily News, Le Boyuan, a reporter for the Social Daily News, Cao Weiquan, a reporter for the Capital Evening News and the Datong News Agency, and Chen Jishen, a reporter for the Peace Daily News. Another person is still unknown. Lang said: "According to my investigation, Chen was wronged because he was dragged along by others, and I don't think he would do such a thing."</p>
<p>According to the collective report, Cao, Xia, and Le visited Lan Shichang first. Le also invited Lan to talk to him at the Social Daily News, advising Lan to entertain the reporters the next day. The next day, they repeatedly contacted</p>
<p>Lan's Daughter</p>
<p>and classmates, demanding fees for entertaining the reporters and ordering coffee, toast, and dinner. The Lans knew their intentions and thought their character was questionable, so they planned to ignore them. Later, "various inaccurate and distorted reports appeared in various small newspapers." At this time, Lang Wenzong went to interview and learned the truth. Lang claimed to be a representative of the Rectification Committee of the Capital Reporters Association to investigate and obtained the above list, publishing the matter in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Now that the truth of the matter has been clarified, people in the news industry have decided to express their opinions. It is said that the Capital Reporters Association plans to</p>
<p>Expel Membership</p>
<p>of the reporters involved in the incident as a show of rectification. However, Chen Jishen of the Peace Daily News, one of the five mentioned above, applied to the newspaper for temporary resignation when the matter was widely rumored. He said that he was falsely accused this time, and the truth will soon be revealed. To show his self-responsibility, he intends to ask for temporary resignation to await the investigation and resolve the matter according to law, in order to achieve the purpose of rectifying the news industry.</p>
<p>As the reporter was writing this, it was learned that the relevant newspapers had taken</p>
<p>Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>for the unscrupulous news extortion case in the capital. Xia Biaoyun of the Construction Daily News and Sang Boyuan of the Social Daily News have been suspended from their positions by the newspaper authorities and are awaiting legal resolution. The identity of Cao Weiquan, a reporter for the Datong News Agency in the Capital Evening News, is still questionable. The Datong News Agency said that Cao was not a reporter for the agency, while the Capital Evening News said that there was Cao Chao, not Cao Weiquan. Tang Wenlan, president of the Capital Evening News, believes that Lang Wenzong and the newspapers that published the matter on the 22nd slandered the newspaper and should bear legal responsibility. Chen Jishen of the Peace Daily News said that he knew nothing about the extortion. In addition to clarifying his position to the Reporters Association, Chen intends to sue Lang Wenzong for defamation. The Social News Agency believes that Shi Shaofang is a special reporter for the agency, and Shi is outside using the agency's name to swagger around and violate the law. He will be subject to legal sanctions. It is also heard that Cao Weiquan and Le Boyuan also intend to sue Lang Wenzong.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd] In order to implement the rectification of the news industry, the Capital Reporters Association decided to organize a Rectification Committee. Ma Xingye, president of the Central Daily News, was the convener. Ma resigned due to being busy. The Organization Group of the Association was designated to be responsible for convening. The group believed that this matter was related to the reputation of all members. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth and correct public perception, they specially formulated reward and complaint methods and announced their implementation to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. The methods stipulate:</p>
<p>Any member of this association who is responsible for protecting the reputation of the group and complains about unscrupulous colleagues will be given a certificate of honor by this association after the association's investigation confirms the facts, and it will be awarded in a public ceremony.</p>
<p>Any person from all walks of life who is responsible for complaining about unscrupulous reporters will be given a bonus by this association after the association's investigation confirms the facts. The amount is the sum of three to six months of all salaries and allowances of the person being complained about, depending on the severity of the circumstances. It will be deducted from the service unit of the person being complained about and sent to the association for distribution.</p>
<p>The term "responsible" in the preceding paragraph refers to the complainant listing their real name, address, and position, and signing and sealing the document, detailing the facts of the complaint. If the complaint is made on the basis of personal grievances and is false, the complainant shall also bear legal responsibility.</p>
<p>All complaint letters should be sent to the Organization Group of the Reporters Association, and this association will absolutely keep the secrets of the complainants.</p>

<h3>"Water Monster" Disappears: Zhenjiang Boats Raise Mast Lights, Sparkling Lights Create a Spectacular Sight</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 22nd] The case of the "water monster", which aroused suspicion, has occurred four times in Zhenjiang this month. However, after the boatmen repeatedly captured water bandits disguised as "water monsters", the fake water monsters, which had been rampant for a month, have recently subsided slightly. However, the timid boatmen along the river and inland rivers, out of fright, are still mostly vigilant. Recently, large and small boats docked in Zhenjiang, in view of the easy exploitation of dark nights, have prepared an oil mast light to be alert. Therefore, after nightfall, the river bank and the moat are dotted with sparkling lights, creating a spectacular sight.

<h3>Armed Member of Changzhou Self-Defense Force Shoots and Kills Innocent Civilian, Falsely Claims to Have Killed Water Monster</h3>
<p>[News from Changzhou, 20th] Hutangqiao in this county is a large town in the south gate area. There is a Jianguo Grand Theater in the town. Recently, the weather has been fine, and Changzhou Tanhuang opera is being performed. Wang Runhai, an armed member of the town's self-defense force, argued with Zhang Jinda, a villager who was watching the opera, over seats. Wang Runhai was originally a local hooligan. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a secret agent under the traitors Jiang Dingsheng and Yin Liangcheng. After the victory, he managed to become an armed member of the team. However, he remained aggressive and evil, not breaking away from his enemy puppet style. He felt that Zhang Jinda had caused him to lose face by arguing with him over seats. He immediately shouted at his accomplices to drag Zhang Jinda out and beat him. Zhang, fearing for his life, ran across the river. Wang Runhai drew his pistol and shot him dead. He then reported to the district office that he had killed a water monster. Public opinion was outraged. A report was made to the court for inspection. On the 19th, Prosecutor Li Yulong of the court went to the countryside and verified that Zhang had indeed been shot to death. The villagers believed that Zhang Jinda had died unjustly and demanded redress. Prosecutor Li arrested Wang Runhai and detained him pending trial.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Large-Scale Suppression in Wu, Yu, Kun, and Tai Counties</h3>

<h3>Explanation by the Ministry of Justice Regarding Lawsuit Against Prosecutor</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 22nd] Regarding the issue of a prosecutor sealing up enemy property and a third party claiming rights and suing the prosecutor, involving the question of who bears the litigation costs, there has been considerable doubt. The Jiangsu High Court submitted the matter to the Ministry of Justice for clarification, which indicated that the prosecutor's litigation costs should be borne as follows: When a prosecutor is sued and appears in court, his seat is the same as that of the defendant's lawyer. The prosecutor can notify the defendant to summon the prosecutor by way of official document instead of having to buy legal stationery.</p>
<h3>Regulations of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: Enlistment of Youth Primarily Through Lottery, Supplemented by Voluntary Enrollment</h3>

<h3>The Last Days of the Arch-Traitor Ye Peng</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Since the victory, great traitors have been arrested and sentenced one by one. The government enforces the law strictly and impartially, which is a most gratifying thing. The arch-traitor Ye Peng, who entrenched himself in Wuhan during the period of occupation, was executed by shooting in Nanjing yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. This arch-traitor met his end on the morning of the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day, which is very heartening and satisfying. At 8:40 AM, the court declared: "The traitor Ye Peng colluded with the enemy, betrayed the country, and plotted to resist this nation. He is sentenced to death." After hearing the verdict, Ye tried to appear calm, repeatedly saying: "It's nothing," "It doesn't matter," only requesting to read the contents of the Chairman's handwritten order. He seemed a little flustered, and his speech was somewhat hesitant. He asked the court if he could say a few words. The court told him to keep it brief.</p>
<p>He said that his death must be due to someone's machinations. He also said: For the sake of his old mother, he did not flee Wuhan and had no choice but to go to Hong Kong. Before going to Hong Kong, he had no thought of things like the "Yan Telegram." Later, he pretended to be "generous" and said: I fought on the front lines, and I am not afraid of death. Everyone has to die, so what is there to fear? Otherwise, I would not be a soldier. Finally, he also said: Although I am ending up this way, I still hope for national unity and the stability of people's lives, and I wish Chairman Chiang good health." At this point, Ye turned around and cast a look at all the listeners, as if seeking sympathy. He issued his last plea before death: Here, there are no outsiders, all "old comrades." I hope everyone will not publicize me as a "traitor," and do not refer to me as a "traitor" in the newspapers! I have no will. My family is all in Shanghai. I hope everyone can sympathize with this request of mine!" At this moment, he seemed to have endless feelings about death.</p>
<p>At 9:10 AM, he was taken to a large truck and driven to the new execution ground at Tianjie Temple outside Zhonghua Gate. He arrived at 9:25 AM. After getting out of the truck, Ye extended his slightly trembling hand and shook hands with the execution supervisor, Chief Luo, and others one by one, repeatedly saying: "There's no way!" "There's no way!" At 9:30 AM, he walked into the execution ground. Just as he was about to turn around and take one last look, the gunshots rang out. The first two shots missed the vital points. The third shot entered from the back and exited from the lower part of the right lung. Ye fell to the ground, his intestines also spilling out, and his whole body spasmed and twitched incessantly. Three minutes later, he breathed his last and died. (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)</p>

<h3>All Five Proposals Successfully Passed; National Textile Federation Meeting Concludes; Emergency Motion Requests Government Not to Passively Limit Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second general meeting of members of the Textile Federation opened at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Mr. Shu. First, the persons in charge of the engineering and business departments of the Textile Construction Company reported. The current difficulties in textile construction and engineering are summarized as follows: There are not enough parts, and the factories received are mostly Japanese style. Before the war, Japan had 15 million spindles. Currently, only 2.8 million spindles are in operation. There are many surplus parts, so it is hoped that assistance can be obtained from Japan in the future. There is insufficient electricity, so the direct and indirect losses suffered by the factories are large. Regarding raw materials, the textile construction mills mainly spin yarns of 10 counts or more, so the raw materials rely entirely on imported cotton. It is hoped that the import quota can be increased. In terms of business, the main tasks are to supply civilian needs and regulate the prices of yarn and cloth. The methods have been changed repeatedly, but the purpose remains unchanged. Efforts are also being made to obtain foreign exchange. Exports of yarn and cloth have obtained US$4.6 million and £1.6 million. In the future, it is hoped that private yarn factories will cooperate to strengthen foreign sales. After the report, the proposals were discussed and passed, totaling 72 proposals from the meeting affairs, raw materials, production, sales, economic, and administrative groups. All proposals were successfully passed based on the review reports.</p>
<h3>Temporary Motions</h3>
<p>At this time, the representatives present proposed three urgent temporary motions: Representative Liu Guojun proposed opposing the agricultural market's cotton purchasing plan, believing this action exceeded the responsibilities of the Agricultural Bank and was intended to compete with yarn factories. After discussion, it was passed. Twenty people including Shi Fengxiang, Pan Yangshan, and Wang Zhuyi proposed a motion suggesting the government should insist during peace talks with Japan on revising Japan's industrial level requirements, demanding compensation for spindles, and declaring the right to veto. After discussion, it was passed, and the assembly sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Political Council. Liu Wensheng proposed a motion suggesting the government should swiftly rescue the economic crisis, promptly reorganize the currency system, and not only implement passive price control policies to avoid affecting production. The motion was passed after deliberation.</p>
<h3>Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>After the proposals were discussed, the chairman announced the Assembly Declaration on the spot. The election of the next term of directors and supervisors was still counting votes yesterday. The list of candidates will be officially announced today, with a quota of 31 people. At about six o'clock, the assembly successfully concluded. The full text of the assembly declaration is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Large Investors Rush to Buy, Most Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>The buying interest was especially strong in the afternoon. Nine out of ten stocks successively rose to the limit. After Yongsheng Yarn hit the limit, it also had a premium of two yuan. Comparing the afternoon closing results with last Saturday's closing, for stocks delivered immediately, Yongsheng Yarn, Xinnuo, Meiya, Huafeng Underwear, and Rongfeng each rose by half a percent; Xinguang, Zifu, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly; Qinxing rose by one percent; Guohuo Cement hit the limit down, but the latter rebounded after hitting the limit, recovering to half a percent lower.

<p>Xinguang Capital Increase, Three Premium Rights</p>
<p>"Xinguang Underwear" shareholder meeting yesterday approved the capital increase and premium plan. It is planned to increase the capital to 26.6 billion national currency, with each old share entitled to subscribe for six new shares. Among them, three shares are calculated at 30 national currency yuan, which will be prepaid by the board of directors. The remaining three shares can be paid in cash by the shareholders. Starting today, the company has designated more than a dozen banks and firms, including Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, and Four Lines Savings Bank, to collect capital increase payments, with a deadline of seven days (payments can be made at the company at No. 27 Chongqing South Road on holidays).</p>
<p>The cotton spinning industry in our country has a history of 60 years and is a national industry with a relatively solid foundation. Examining the industrial evolution of advanced countries, the textile industry is the foundation for everything. Therefore, this assembly has been meeting for three consecutive days. After careful research, it is the consensus that we should not only awaken the attention of people from all walks of life across the country, but also encourage the concerted efforts of practitioners in this industry to shoulder the heavy responsibility together, complete the goal of ten million spindles according to Chairman Chiang's instructions, alleviate the panic of the people at home in terms of clothing, and compete for the international trade market. However, this cannot be achieved overnight, and we must advance simultaneously in three aspects: cultivating talents, manufacturing machinery ourselves, and promoting raw materials to achieve self-reliance. In addition, we should also strive to improve production efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs, and standardize quality standards. However, the success of a business must first have sufficient conditions for survival before development can be considered. Practitioners in this industry must make due efforts, and the government and people from all walks of life in society must also provide strong assistance so that success can be achieved with half the effort, and national economy and people's livelihood can benefit each other. As the assembly closes, we hereby reveal the above three points to encourage people across the country.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were sluggish yesterday but suddenly became popular. Buying momentum started, and large investors chased after them. There were widespread rumors of reduced margin requirements, and popular stocks rose sharply, especially Meiya, which rose the fastest. Stocks can be paid in cash by the shareholders. Starting today, the company has designated more than a dozen banks and firms, including Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, and Four Lines Savings Bank, to collect capital increase payments, with a deadline of seven days (payments can be made at the company at No. 27 Chongqing South Road on holidays).</p>

<h3>Rumors of Issuing Large Denomination Notes in the Market</h3>
<p>Central Bank Claims It Is Not True</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Yesterday, there were rumors in the market that banknotes with denominations of 20,000 and 50,000 yuan would be issued soon. According to the responsible authorities of the Central Bank, it is not true. It is obviously a rumor created by speculators to disrupt the market in order to profit from speculation. Fortunately, all sectors of society will not be misled.</p>
<h3>The Price Appraisal Committee of the Commodity Price Appraisal Council Determined the Maximum Price Limit of Flour</h3>
<p>Retail Sales Must Not Exceed 159,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Flour Group of the Shanghai Commodity Price Appraisal Council held the second appraisal meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, chaired the meeting and reported that the price of flour was originally strictly limited by the Food Ministry and the China Trust Bureau. Now that the sale of flour has been stopped, the price limit has also been lifted at the same time. It is urgent to determine the price according to the cost and announce it for implementation. Factory representatives and flour merchants expressed their opinions successively. After evaluation by all the representatives present, the factory price was determined to be 153,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price was determined to be no more than 159,000 yuan, according to the previous factory price plus a profit of 4 percent, totaling 6,120 yuan. The appraised price has been approved for implementation by the Director of the Appraisal Committee in accordance with regulations. In addition to reporting to the municipal government for record, the Social Affairs Bureau also immediately announced the matter. If there is any violation of the above appraised price, it will be punished in accordance with the Regulations on Combating Violations of Price Limits and Appraised Prices, and no leniency will be shown.</p>
<p>The representatives attending yesterday also resolved that the Flour Appraisal Committee would hold a meeting every Monday morning at 9:00 a.m.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>Disputes Arise from Clearing Debts from Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>An Interlude in the Changing Value of Currency</p>
<p>Dear Editor: A borrowed 200 legal currency from his close friend B in the 26th year of the Republic of China and made a contract. It was stated that it would be paid off within three years, without interest. Now party A wants to repay the money and take back the contract, but party B insists that the legal currency has depreciated and must be calculated according to the proportion of rice prices. In this way, the repayment will be tens of thousands of times more than the original amount, which party A considers too large and cannot afford. Mediation has been ineffective. Now there are several questions, please answer, Is it necessary to calculate the loan of the Republic of China in the 25th year today? Is there any express provision, How is the legal depreciation rate of the legal currency, Is it legal to repay the original 200 yuan with 300,000 yuan today, Are there any precedents in similar disputes in the High Court, and what is the judgment?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] There is no express provision, but the court may be requested to fairly weigh the increase or decrease in payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Rules for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration. The law does not recognize it, and there is no statutory depreciation rate. It is originally legal, but the creditor may sue the court for a ruling if he thinks it is obviously unfair. There is no precedent in the Supreme Court. The disposal of the court varies from place to place. According to what the answerer knows, in Shanghai, there have been precedents of paying back bank deposits before the war at 2,000 times and 4,000 times. However, the Zhejiang High Court ruled in the case of Zhang Shipei's appeal in Jiaxing. Zhang borrowed 250 legal currencies from his friend Zhang Zhaozong in the 28th year of the Republic of China. It was impossible to recover the money during the war. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, after repeated negotiations, the opinions of the parties were not close, resulting in litigation. Initially, the local court ruled that the defendant should repay 1,000 times. The plaintiff refused to accept the appeal and was sentenced to pay 10,000 times.</p>

<h3>Fifteen Japanese War Criminals Innocent</h3>
<p>— Chi Fu</p>
<p>On the eve of the second anniversary of Japan's surrender and signing, General MacArthur announced another "benevolent government" for Japan. That is the United Press International's August 31 Tokyo telegram: "Five former Japanese cabinet members, including one admiral, one false army general, one leader of the zaibatsu, and ten other major war criminals who have not yet been tried, were released from Sugamo Prison on the 30th."</p>
<p>When these war criminals were released from prison, they asked the prison authorities one after another: "Released! Is it really true?" Everyone was overjoyed and thanked General MacArthur's holy virtue.</p>
<p>When the news spread to the world, everyone was half believing and half doubting. Believing was MacArthur's arbitrariness and his policy of indulging Japan, there must be such a thing, but indulging too much and it was not the right time; doubting was that the "spirit" of the Potsdam Declaration was not to be destroyed by the defeated countries, and not to be destroyed by the United Nations, but by the unilateral destruction of the United States. In the future peace conference with Japan, how will the Allied countries speak? How will the terms of the future peace treaty with Japan be written? It's really puzzling.</p>
<p>To be fair, General MacArthur's release of this group of war criminals was indeed a wrong measure, and people of the Allied countries should protest! In particular, the Allied prosecutor (the Chinese prosecutor is Xiang Zhejun) announced that this group of war criminals would not be prosecuted, which is extremely absurd, and people of the supervisory countries should protest! Now we introduce the resumes of this group of "innocent" invaders, and let fair readers judge:</p>

<h3>The Positive Effect of Hot Water Bags</h3>
<p>In the minds of American writers, Chinese women have extraordinary wisdom. They use the rubber bags commonly found in hospitals as hand warmers, and for a period of time, it became a trend. Almost all women have a bag in their hearts, and the colors of the bags are also divided into gold, silver, red, gray, green, pink, etc., plus a square silk handkerchief, just like icing on the cake. American women would never think so thoughtfully and fascinatingly. The original function of the warm bag is to dispel pain from tumors in the hospital. If you have a tumor in any part of your body, the doctor will give you a rubber bag filled with warm water and apply it to the affected area several times a day. After three to five days, the swelling will subside and the pain will stop. If you feel uncomfortable with hot water in summer, you can switch to ice water. Ice water has the same anti-swelling effect. This treatment is extremely popular in Chinese folk customs, but there are no hot water bags in the countryside. They use a spatula for cooking. They heat the spatula in a pot and gently strike the affected area several times a day. After striking, the patient feels scorched and uncomfortable, and after striking a few times, the swelling and pain will be relieved. This folk method is considered superstitious by Chinese-style Western doctors. How can a knife cure the disease? In fact, it is not the knife that cures the disease, but the heat. When American exporters packed a large number of hot water bags to China, the American medical community was greatly surprised when they saw the number of hot water bags exported in the export goods. They thought that Chinese medicine had developed so rapidly, and so many hot water bags were used, and other sanitary products could be imagined. Later, they specially sent several medical authorities to China to investigate hygiene undertakings and found that Chinese women all carried a hot water bag, and they couldn't help laughing to themselves. After returning to the United States, one of the authorities wrote a wonderful book, praising the intelligence of Chinese women. There are many clever things Chinese people do, such as tightening the legs of the quilt cover to hold rice, using the bathtub as a boat, Nanjing people modified the three-wheeled machine foot road army into an eight-seater passenger car, using firecrackers as DDT, pasting movie newspapers on walls, and using banknotes to light cigarettes, all of which are creative and economical.</p>
<p>The above figures were all arrested by General MacArthur after September 12, 1945. After two years without trial, the prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal announced that they were "innocent" and released. Is it reasonable? Let the readers judge!</p>
<h3>The Japanese People Discuss MacArthur</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>[Translator's Note] An American magazine reporter interviewed Japanese people, asking, "What is your impression of MacArthur?" Their answers were almost uniformly praising MacArthur first, then lamenting their suffering to gain the sympathy and aid of Americans. The cunning Japanese people!</p>
<p>Student: Most Japanese people believe that the current military control is beneficial to our country. MacArthur is a genius, and you Americans should support him. Unfortunately, the food supply is poor. This year is a matter of life and death. There is a lack of housing. You will often find five or six families living in one room.</p>
<p>Hotel Clerk: Every Japanese person thinks MacArthur is a good man. We have hope and hope that your army will continue to stay here until the Japanese can be self-sufficient. First, you must help us eliminate the black market. Everything is too expensive. The value of sugar has exceeded that of jewels.</p>
<p>Travel Agent: All Japanese people are extremely pleased that you sent MacArthur to our country. The Soviet Union would not treat me so kindly. We hope that Americans will sponsor us to restore our pre-war state. Food and clothing are insufficient except when obtained through the black market.</p>
<p>Newspaper Boy: Prices are too high. I hope this is the peak. However, American officials treat me so kindly. I am willing to work for them. I hope I can meet MacArthur.</p>
<p>Grocery Store Owner: Living conditions are better than a year ago. Food is still lacking, and so is clothing. A year ago, we had nothing. MacArthur gave people jobs. We urgently need free trade. We love and need America.</p>
<p>Jeweler: I want to see prices drop. Under military control, the general situation is better. I understand Americans. I have been trading with them for twenty years. They are good people, just like MacArthur. I hope to be able to trade freely again immediately. Japan needs it.</p>
<p>Merchant: National expenditure is three to four hundred times higher than before the war. We hope you can stay here until we can be self-sufficient. We fear the Soviet Union. We need MacArthur's protection. He will prevent the Soviet Union from repeating on our country what it did to European countries.</p>
<p>Old Bookstore Owner: Living conditions are very bad. The black market is causing us to struggle painfully. We need more help. We need America. Only MacArthur can satisfy the inadequate strength of our government.</p>
<h3>Please Postpone the Dancing Ban</h3>
<p>— Li Ling</p>
<p>Dancing, in civilized countries in Europe and America, is originally a proper form of entertainment and common social activity between men and women. However, like an orange north of the Huai River turning into a bitter orange, once it comes to China, it changes its nature, becoming a profession that allows those pitiful people struggling on the brink of starvation to survive. The reason for this change in nature need not be concealed; it is a serious problem of the current society that is not simple. The change in the nature of dancing is just a subtle manifestation of the society’s unhealthy phenomena.</p>
<p>Is the reason why dance hostesses are dance hostesses because they willingly use their physical appearance to gain the favor of young masters? Are they willingly degenerate and refuse to engage in productive work? When we look around, the young men and women who are unemployed upon graduation have the ambition and intention to participate in productive work, to serve the country and society, and to strive for their own future. However, the productive sectors of society are currently too few. Even this group of pure and promising young men and women with knowledge cannot be accommodated, let alone our group of dance hostesses and practitioners who lack production skills, insufficient intelligence, and inadequate ability.</p>
<p>Some people say, "The life of a dance hostess is too extravagant." This is a fact that we do not deny. However, extravagant dance hostesses are actually only a minority. More than ninety percent of us engage in the dance industry at night and take care of household chores during the day. Those with children also have to take care of their children and bear the double burden of being a housewife and a working woman. If one only sees the few extravagant dance hostesses and assumes that all dance hostesses are extravagant, that is tantamount to saying, "Schools ask for money, so education is undesirable."</p>
<p>Banning dancing will not only increase the number of unemployed people in Shanghai by more than 20,000 but will also exacerbate the unemployment problem that society urgently needs to solve but cannot. As the ancient saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and shame." If society truly had a way to maintain our livelihood, the government would not need to ban dancing, and we would automatically change our profession. Conversely, even if the government orders a ban on dancing, it will only create the tragic fate of more than 20,000 people in reality! We hope that the wise government will postpone the implementation of the ban, allowing us a chance to catch our breath and change our profession at ease. (Note: Ms. Li is one of the directors of the Shanghai Dance Hostess Association.)</p>
<h3>"Free Talk" Over Thirty-Six Years</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>From April 1, the ninth year of the Republic of China, to November 30, the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, this considerably long period of twelve years was hosted by Zhou Shoujuan. Those who wrote for "Free Talk" were all the famous so-called "Saturday School" literati of the time in Shanghai. The content was nothing more than "talking about love," "romanticizing nature," and "broadly discussing various topics." At one point, the pages were divided into categories such as "Idle Talk," "Miscellany," "Miscellaneous Things Heard," "Travel Notes," "Drama Talk," "Leftovers," and "Trivia." In addition, lengthy serialized chapters of novels and anecdotes about the literary scene never ceased.</p>
<p>This style did not undergo a sudden change until Li Liewen took over "Free Talk" at the end of the twenty-first year, and the one who inherited this mantle was the newly created "Spring and Autumn Supplement," still hosted by Zhou Shoujuan.</p>
<p>The period when Li Liewen edited "Free Talk," although only a short year and five months, broke through the past style of "Free Talk," writing in another direction, deeply influencing the literary youth of the time. At that time, it was indeed a "Free Talk" and also an important page in the modern Chinese literary history!</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Liang Cai, the general manager of this newspaper's history, was actively improving the newspaper. Coincidentally, Li Liewen had just returned from France, and he was hired to the newspaper to edit "Free Talk." Li's first shot after taking over was to cut off the serialized novel "The Crossroads of the Times and Love" by Zhang Ziping. Zhang Ziping's novel therefore declined greatly in popularity. Li Liewen completely turned "Free Talk" into a base for new literature, and almost all of the first-class writers in China at the time were captured by "Free Talk." Those who regularly contributed included Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Mao Dun, Lao She, etc. At the same time, because he paid attention to essays, he promoted many new writers, such as Kang Qiang and Kong Lingjing.</p>
<p>Precisely because the writing of "Free Talk" at that time had an explosive nature, an announcement was finally posted, "Allowed to Talk About Love Affairs," and the style became slightly more bland, but the writers were still the original team. Among them, Lu Xun used many pen names due to special relationships. The more commonly used ones were "He Jia Gan," "Leisure," "Congee," "Lühua," and "Luo Wen." Later, because it was inconvenient for him to come forward himself, he simply wrote articles, asked people to copy them, and added a pen name, so even the editors were deceived. These texts were later included by Lu Xun in "False Freedom Book," "Allowed Love Affairs Talk," and "Fringe Literature."</p>
<p>During that time, there were several major debates, such as the problem of students reading Zhuangzi's selected works, the problem of mass language, and even the problem of humor and the problem of sons-in-law, all of which were very famous and can be seen in everyone's essays.</p>
<p>In May of the twenty-third year, Li resigned and was succeeded by Zhang Zisheng (May 9), returning from splendor to plainness until the cessation of publication on November 1 of the twenty-fourth year.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the Shenbao was once moved to Hankou and Hong Kong for publication. "Free Talk" was also published some of the time during the year or so in Hong Kong. In the tenth month of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Shenbao was republished in Shanghai, and "Free Talk" was hosted by "Wang Renshu," still with a "Lu Xun style."</p>
<p>Soon, Hu Shanyuan changed the editorship, and the writers were mostly young literati, such as Ding Di and Wen Zongshan, and the style became even more bland. After more than a year, Huang Jiayin edited it, specializing in Western essays and scientific interest, with the same style as his Western Breeze Magazine.</p>
<p>Thus, until December 8 of the thirty-first year, the Pacific War broke out, and the newspaper was suspended.</p>
<p>After the victory, the Shenbao gloriously resumed publication in Shanghai. "Free Talk" was initially edited by Huang Jiayin, and in May of last year, it was edited by Bu Shaofu, the deputy editor-in-chief of this newspaper. In February of this year, Qian Taisheng took over the editorship and has continued until now.</p>
<p>There is no need to say more about everything concerning "Free Talk" at present. One point to add here is that "Free Talk" was originally a garden for new literature, but after the victory, it was transplanted to "Spring and Autumn." "Free Talk" specializes in newsy, educational, scientific, knowledge-based, and interesting essays. As mentioned above, although the style and content of "Free Talk" have changed repeatedly, there is only one principle: it is always a truly "Free Talk," free and unrestrained, without prejudice or restraint!
