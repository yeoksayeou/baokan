<h3>開源節流雙管齊下　安定物價平衡收支　俞鴻鈞氏說明財政方針</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕參政會廿三日晨舉行第五次會議，聽取命部畏鴻鈞財政報吿。大會於九時廿分開始，張伯苓主席，本日報到參政員二八六人，出席者一九一人，俞氏報吿約歷一小時，繼聽取谷參政員書面及口頭質詢，十二時半散會，下午三時開第六次會，繼續口頭質詢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕俞部長鴻鈞，廿三日晨於參會報告財政時，指出「當前財政經濟嚴重性，為不能諱言亦毋庸諱言之事」。據稱：最嚴重之財政問題，即物價問題，政府目前切實努難平衡，而預算平衡後，對物價平定亦有助益。俞氏繼就目前財政狀況及今後努力方針加以關將爲百分之廿一點四，較去歲尤少。在本年度九萬三千餘億歲出總預算中，國防費佔百分之卅六，較以往為少，而敎育文化支出，則較前增加。俞氏繼分析收支情形，認稅收部門尚可設法整頓，據估計可超出原預算三萬餘億，美金債券可得四萬餘億，敵偽產業等重估價後又可增二萬億，益以原定之七萬億收入，總歲入數可達十七萬餘億。而支出方面，過去四個月共支五萬億，未來八個月約需十二萬餘億，益以其他二萬億，總數將達廿萬億。與歲入十七萬億相差三萬餘億。關於此一差額如何彌補問題，聞爲各方關切。當局為使收支能接近平術計，正自困難中謀求出路，今後對稅收將盡更大努力，務求切實滑加，機構亦設法予以調整。此外，擬樹立債信，發行公債，襟售敵偽物資及剩餘物資等，以增收入。至支出方面，則當局已下最大決心，凡一切非迫切之需要，非建設性之支出，力求節省。開源節流，雙管齊下，當可渡過難關。俞氏說明財政應朮自力更生，因之即舉辦外債，亦將爲完成復員建設，加速國內經濟穩定而使用，決不用以平衡預算。繼就改進賦稅制度，調整稅收機構，安定金融，地方財政情形等，逐一分析，指出整理幣制確爲穩定金融最有效之辦法，過去數月財部對此問題無時不在詳密研究中，然此事關係重要，非至相當時機，尚難作具體決定。</p>
<h3>俞鴻鈞財政報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕財政部長俞鴻鈞，於廿三日上午參政會第五次大會時，作財政報吿，原文如次：　當前財政經濟問題的嚴重性，不能諱言，亦毋庸諱言。我們認淸現在最迫切的財政經濟問題，就是物價問題，因此，大家都感覺到如何安定物價，如何平衡預算，應爲政府所切實努力的兩大目標。而兩者之間，是具有連帶關係的，因爲平衡國家預算，即可減少通貨發行，而物價也可藉此安定。從另一方面看，物價的穩定，也有助於預算的平衡，因爲物價穩定，則收支均易控制，然後求其平衡，也較易爲力。一年以來，財政部同人，就是朝着這兩大目標，多方努力，爲求達此目標，對於財政政策的運用，一方面是配合國民經濟發展之需要，改進租稅制度，并衡量納稅人負擔能力，擴大各項可能的收入，一方面加強管制金融，督導資金運用，以協助生產建設。同時在租稅以外，運用公債及物資政策，以社會遊資與國際剩餘經濟力量及敵偽財產售價，作爲收入補充。此外，如調整機構，改革財務行政，整飭稅務人員風紀，以及充實地方財政工作等，均經切實推行，顧國家財政收支，有時不免爲國內政治與經濟情祝所影響，自政府推行增加收入政策以後，每年租稅及事業收入，曾有大量之增加，惟勝利之後，政府雖再三努力國內和平統一，迄未實現，交通受阻，生產停滯，致財政所憑藉之經濟事業，受重大之影響，稅源自難充裕，而復員綏靖之支出，仍爲歲出之重要部份。同時，生產建設，爲繁榮經濟之必要步驟，在綏靖區，尤須積極推行，支出浩繁，國庫收支遂不能完全適合。同時，因政府說意增加收入之結果，致人民負擔，尚不能盡爲合理之調整，即培養稅源之工作，還未有充分予以　及，經濟與財政配合之政策，效果尚未大著，人民生活水準，未能及時提高，且財政上若干措施，尚未脫戰時管制色彩，均與平時財政之本質不合，此皆爲此後應當繼續改進者。以上所報吿，係現在財政情形之論廓，茲再將財政金融實況分別作簡單的報吿：（一）國庫收支情形，國庫收支分爲卅五年及卅六年度兩段報吿，卅五年國家總澦算，歲出部份，共列二萬五千二百四十九億餘萬元，在年度進行中，實際支出，則爲五萬五千六百七十二億餘萬元，計超過原預算二萬七千六百七十七億餘萬元，是預算外的支出，約佔全部支出百分之四十九點七。至於收入方面，以賦稅收入為較多，次爲財產及物資售價收入等，共佔百分之三五點五二，其餘以債款收入彌補，佔百分之六四點四八，我們檢討預算，所以仍有很大差額的原因，實以是年抗戰甫經結束，國內秩序尚未恢復，軍務支出，復員善後救濟支出，以及調整公務員生活輔助費，改善士兵待遇等支出，數目龐大，都是預算外的支出，而且省無可省。雖然如此，但是年收支差額，已降至百分之六四·四八，較之三十四年度差額百分之九十，三十年差額百分之八十，及以往各年度差額，均在百分之七五以上的狀況尚有進步。　本年度總預算歲入歲出，各列九萬三千七百餘億元。歲入部份，以賦稅收入居第一位，佔總數百分之三八·五，其次爲財產及物資售價收入，佔百分之二七·二，其次爲公有營業盈餘收入，佔百分之九·二，再其次爲徵借實物收入，佔百分之二·三其他收入，共佔百分之一·二，大部份都是國家正常收入，合計列七萬二千餘億元，約爲總歲入百分之七八·五，較之上年度增加甚多、，其餘不數之數，仍列債款收入，計二萬零五百餘億元，僅佔歲入總數百分之二一·四，至於歲出部份，雖然仍以國防支出爲較鉅，約佔總歲出百分三六，但較以往各年度支出之百分比，已經大爲減低，次爲建設支出，佔百分之一七，次爲復員及救濟支出，佔百分一五，次爲普通政務支出，佔百分之一三，是本年歲出方面，軍費比較減小，建設事業的支出，教育文化支出及省市補助費的支出，比較增加。預算分酊，較以往任何年度爲合理，實可表現政府施政的重心，且歲出歲入相抵差額，僅爲百分之二十在強，亦為歷年預算差額百分比最小的一年。　本年度已過去將五個月，自一月至四月，本爲淡微時間，根據納庫數字，收入方面，共得二萬餘億元，支出方面，則爲五萬餘億元。據目前之估計，本年度稅收，可超過原澦算三萬億元，敵偽資產及剩餘物資，因外匯匯率業經改變，可增收二萬億餘元，美金公債與庫券，可得四萬八千億元，連同原歲入總預算，共可能達十七萬億元。支出方面，原預算列九萬三千餘億元，惟因綏靖地方，恢復交通，振恤災黎及調整文武職人負待遇等所費均鉅，估計五月至年底，尚須支出約十二萬億餘元，連同一至四月份已支數，共約十八萬億元，再增列預備費二萬億元，共需支出二十萬億元，除將收入十七萬億元相抵外，其不敷之數，正在妥繁財源，以資彌補。　各位先生對收支差額如何彌補之問題，一定是非常關懷，政府同人對此問題，亦正在苦心擘劃，平衡收支，非空言所能奏效，政治，經濟，財政，是有速環性的，是息息相關的，國家的和平統一，固然是一切有效建設揹施之前提，但是我們不能認爲政治不安定就不盡力去想出比較有效的補救辦法，我們要在困苦艱難局面中尋求出路。因此我們爲求國庫收支之接近平衡，第一要在租稅方面爲更大之努力，切實增加直接稅之比重，使財富階級，對國家復興建設有所貢獻。間接稅與消費稅，則注重重課奢侈品與非生活必需品，同時，調整征收機構，嚴密控制稅源，簡化稽征手續，以革除積弊，充裕稅收。其次樹立債信，推行公債政策及加速出售（一）敵偽產業（二）剩餘物資，以及（三）不必由政府經營之生產事業。在支出方面，政府已下最大的決心，凡非國家迫切之需要及非有利於生產建設事業之支出，必須節約停止。此外，國家財政回應自力更生，但戰後歐洲國家如英國·法國·都循國際合作之途徑，在國際間取得援助。我國八年抗戰，創鉅痛深，以前對世界和平，有很偉大之貢獻，我國經濟秩序，迅速恢復，原爲各友邦一致之玲望，抑亦全世界安全與繁榮之所繫，故擬於適當時期，在國外商洽，以期獲得財政之助助，不過在此有應特別指出者，就是政府決不依賴外債以彌補費用之不足。所希望者，藉此以促進復員時期國家重要建設儘先之完成，加速國內經濟之穩定。（未完）</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕參政會廿四日上下午分別舉行第七·八兩次會議，上午爲農林，交通報告，下午為軍事，善後救濟報告。</p>
<h3>陳啟天定期視事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕新任經濟部部長陳啟天，定廿九日上午九時到部視事，與前任經長王雲五辦理交接。陳氏廿三日語記者，渠於此國內經濟情況相當嚴重之際，出任經長，深覺職責之重，尚盼各方人士予以指示及匡助。該部政次張子柱，主任秘書朱世龍，將於廿九日隨同到部視事，常次童季齒尚在美，由劉泗英暫代。</p>
<h3>參政員質詢財政　重點在平衡預算</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕參政會廿三日上下午會議中提出有關財政書面口頭質詢時，對平衡預算問題最爲重視。吳望伋指出，欲朮平衡預算與其征稅不若從之頓國營事業着手，郵電鐵路航政等公用事業是否有浪費情形？若有，應如何整頓？皆值得注意。</p>
<h3>發行特種庫券　應予愼重考慮</h3>
<p>因平衡預算而連帶引起之公債問題，亦爲質詢集中點，陳耀東認爲特種短期庫券可以發行，蓋此舉不特可使法幣回籠，通貨收縮，且可使游資納入正軌。朱惠淸則持反對意見，朱氏指出美金債券發行成績欠佳，一個半月以來，售出不及百分之五，若照此種此例，至三年後，始能銷完。銷路滯呆之原因，主要爲國家已喪失信用，因之對於發行特種短期庫券事，應慎重考慮。潘朝英亦認爲欲發行新債須從整理舊債着手，蓋一切公債皆係民脂民膏，應予合理償還。　來自民問之參政員對租稅事最爲關切，趙雪峯認爲稅收欲增加，商人越困難，結果國庫收支不能增加，而徒令經手人中飽。張良修舉出華南實情，說明剔除中飽之必要。</p>
<h3>銀行經營業務　往往出範圍</h3>
<p>尹述賢等對管制金融提出意見，指出銀行所經營業務，往往超出範圍，甚至經營米煤，應加限制。江一平吳望伋亦持同探主張。</p>
<p>此外各參政員對外匯管理，留學生請領外匯，及報館用紙等問題，亦皆提出詢問，先後所提書面及口頭質詢七十餘件。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕參政會廿三日下午三時舉行第六次會議，林虎主席，各參政員繼續對財政報吿作口頭質詢，由俞部長就平衡澦算等各點口頭答覆。俞氏指出，租稅爲增加國庫收入最穩妥，最良好之方法，蓋國家支出浩繁，若全賴發行以為彌補，危險實甚，同時，發行通貨，等於增加人民負擔，不若租稅之爲合理與平均。</p>
<h3>以直接稅方法　限制豪門資本</h3>
<p>有人主張對付豪門，其實有錢者額上並不寫字，並善於化整爲零，不若以直接稅方法予以限制爲佳，蓋此稱稅收爲累進性質，財產愈大，所納愈多，殊爲公允　關於平衡澦算，政府正盡最大努力，以求收支能接近平衡，蓋當局深知多一張鈔票，即增一分危險也。至當局努力方向，仍不外整理租稅，出售敵偽物資等，使法幣回籠，並設法剔除中飽。</p>
<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者俞振</p>
<p>俞部長鴻鈞廿三日於參會報吿財政，劈頭即謂：「鴻鈞奉命向貴會報吿，願就過去一年財政情形，切實檢討，坦率陳述。」能度誠懇，爲數日來最受歡迎的一位部長。</p>
<p>俞部長報吿，一大串數目字，關心收支平衡的參政員邊聽邊記，並加核算，預備提出質詢。</p>
<p>財俞報告過去一年中，因違法·貪污·　職而被撤職法辦之稅務人員共達三百人，數目聽來嚇人。　各方關心之幣制改革問題，財政報吿中亦有提及，俞說整理幣制爲穩定金融最有效辦法，但茲事體大，非至「相當時期」，不能有「具體決定」。</p>
<p>書面詢間中，某參政員認若干銀行爲「官僚資本的空中堡壘」。</p>
<p>葉溯中，沈之敬二人詢問中，因財政問題，聯想到書報業前途。沈之敬並指出，英國兩個人看一份報，美國三個人看一份報。並謂此事與文化有關。有一位同業說：「京滬各報在會塲散發，每一參政員至少看五份報，可見參政員程度長高」。</p>
<p>爲了應否延長時間問題，主席張伯苓徵求會衆意見，潘朝英說：「每人說話時間應以五分鐘爲限，不然參政會兩三個月都開不完」。</p>
<p>口頭詢問，余楠秋說：「法國大革命前夕，國庫中僅存六毛錢，政府請貴族拿錢出來，貴族不答應，結果發生革命，吃虧的還是貴族」。</p>
<p>大炮伍純武該問，俞部長說財產我因技術困難，至今未辦，財部對窮鄉僻壞，深山幽谷老百姓的每一顆米，每一塊錢都有辦法，爲什麼對有錢人的財藍反而調查困難。</p>
<p>陳耀東說通貨與物價繼續要跑下去，老百姓可受不了。他主張非常時期應採非常手段，對於危害國民經濟的權貴資本應採有效辦法。</p>
<p>雲南代表趙澍，主張公開財政數字，他說財政不公開，適足以使有些人掀風作浪。</p>
<p>無錫代表薛明劍現身說法，報吿在無錫辦工業成績，結論是：「惟有辦工業，始足解決一切國難」。吳望伋指斥金融界放棄正當業務不幹，從事投機營利，「肥了金融界，瘦了老百姓」。</p>
<p>若干參政員提及走私問題，張良修報吿華南情形，據說，廣東等地「走私「公行，結果成爲「走公」，此輩自天而降，因之大家給他們起個渾名爲「降落傘部隊」。</p>
<p>張又報吿稅務人員舞弊情形稱：廣東有一句俗語，呌做「三三三一」一筆稅收，三成向上司進貢，三成歸牽綫人，三成入私囊，剩下來的一成，才繳納政府。</p>
<p>蕭一山問「三朝元老」，北平是一個文化城，所分到白報紙，何以如此少？</p>
<p>周謙沖認爲乞靈印刷機，等於自殺，數月前薪水可抵美金一百元的人，幾經調整後，只抵上三四十元美金，抵不上美國最苦工人的收入。</p>
<p>好些人爲俞部長打氣，張潛華盼財部拿出勇氣來，希望俞部長以政治家風度對付豪門。</p>
<p>俞部長分十點答覆各參政員質問，半小時中至少說了幾十次「諸位先生」。一路都極順利，想不到最後幾分鐘，引起軒然大波，錢公來，黃宇人兩人幾次起而質詢，會塲上鬧哄哄的。關於財部錢幣司戴司長常在上海事，俞部長用手指部會長官席說「戴本人就在此地」說時用手指長官席，全塲哄堂。</p>

<h3>參政員呼籲和平　將分別向大會提出方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕此次參政會討論主題，張伯苓於致開會詞中，業已說明，將以和平為先，在政治質詢時，參政員所提出質詢重點，亦在於和談同，惟因目前大會尚在報告階段，各案尚未提出。據聞：民盟對和平所提方案，廿三日可以定稿，定廿四日提交大會。許德珩欲提之和平方案，尚未擬定，周炳琳已決不南來。又參政員　曉籟，胡秋原，朱惠清，吳蘊初，奚倫，劉啟瑞，端木愷等，亦向大會提出一合理之和平方案，主文爲呼籲和平，幹旋和平，以教國家危亡·辦法爲：（一）本會向政府及中共呼籲和平，要求雙方立即就地停戰。（二）由參會組和平促進會，派遣適當人選，向雙方徽求和平意見，並研究公允合理之和平方案。（三）由參會以此方案徵求雙方同意，重開和談。（四）拒絕呼籲，拒絕和談者，即爲破壞和平責任者，參會當號召國民共棄之。俞氐再度慎重聲明，財部決不致以外債平衡預算。關於整理幣制，俞謂：東北及合灣情形，均爲權宜之計，過相當時期後，當加整理。至徵用國外存款一事，非外交不爲功，而所得之答覆，爲「格於法令，無法協助」。對於此事，政府已於經濟緊急措施方案中規定，用利誘威脅方法，促此類資金能用於生產途徑。若干參政員對貼補國營事業事提出詢問，俞氏稱此爲政府不得已之舉動，當局正考慮重擬新辦法。　當局對走私事亦極注意，蓋走私現象一日不去除，外匯黑市即無法消滅。政府已飭海關嚴加防範，並派員赴港，設法使此一漏洞能修堵塞。</p>
<h3>關於黃金潮案　正由法院辦理</h3>
<p>俞氏繼答覆關於黃金案及調查揚子·中孚兩公司經過。關於黃金潮案，俞氏簡單答覆謂，此事正由法院辦理中。關於調查揚子·中孚公司購買冰箱·吉普車·無綫電，俞謂，財部奉令會同經濟部調查，現正責成海關調查。中孚公司所輸入之吉普車，係卅五年四月廿九日前啟運者。相信此案經公正嚴密調查後，必能水落石出。某參政員所詢中央銀行總裁可否兼其他公司董事長等事。俞謂，余未聞張總裁曾有此種兼職，並指出政府曾明令政府官吏不得兼營商業，法有明文，若有此種情事，當依法辦理，惟國行總裁不受財部節制。俞答覆至此，黃宇人對中孚，揚予公司事續有詢問，盼能向參會報告，俞謂，財部奉命密查，調查所得，當向政府報吿，此爲天經地義之事。</p>
<h3>中紡盈餘問題　財部曾予調查</h3>
<p>俞氏對中紡公司盈餘繳納國庫事，亦曾有所答覆。據謂，該公司去歲僅繳盈餘八百億，財部曾往調查，中紡初尚拒絕，後查得總盈餘共三六八二億，除去公積金後，亦應有二千四百餘億，然中紡另有其解釋。</p>
<p>黃宇人再起立，就林鳳苞任國行充計委員事提出詢間，對林舊案未淸何以遞任厥職，而保釋林氏者，即爲俞氐，盼俞說明。俞謂此事可詢諸司法院。</p>
<h3>會塲一度緊張　主席宣告休息</h3>
<p>黃氏續有詢問，會塲空氣殊緊張，時俞己返原座，不久主席宣吿休息，一塲風波亦隨之平息，時已五時有半。參政員向財部質詢</p>
<h3>報紙進口過少　無異摧殘民主</h3>
<p>參政員向財部質詢</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕關於親聞用紙進口數量過少問題，參政員沈之敬廿三日第五次大會時曾就此發言，略謂現行外匯管制政策中，關於紙類進口外匯作苛刻限制，每月核准進口紙額，尚不敷上海一市報界之用，各省市更不能享受分酊紙額，如政府向真正民主道路走，報紙特別是地方報紙，乃不可缺少的工具，如今施政方針，滿紙渲染民主，財政經濟政策卻無情地摧殘民主的尖兵輿論，曾見報上有一統計，美人平均每三人有報一份，英人每二人有一份，五強以外的印度，二百人亦有一份報看，請問五強之一的中國人民，每若干人纔有一份報看，請財部計算考慮，是否應增加紙類進口外匯或取銷限制。</p>
<h3>各地糧食情形　當局決予調劑　谷正倫在參政會答詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕廿三日下千參政會第六次大會中，財政報吿質詢完畢，休息十分鐘後，谷部長正倫報吿糧政，分田賦征實，平抑糧價等八點說明，繼聽取書面及口頭詢問卅餘件，各參政員所提者，生要集中於米潮及征實等問題，北方代表提及華北糧荒嚴重，盼速救濟，何基鴻指出，華北麥子僅二寸高，饑荒難免，孫繩武力言華北糧荒，民食堪處，盼能運糧接濟。晉·閩等地參政員亦各報吿當地糧食情形，盼當局重視，谷氏答覆，略謂：當局對華北糧食情形，無時不在注意中，現己決定以麵粉十萬袋運往天津，今後將續運往。閩·粵素來缺糧，當局決定除軍糧外，有餘糧則設法調劑。谷氏最後並稱：將有洋米廿萬噸運來，此事對我糧食問題，當大有助，會議至下午七時四十分始散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕關於糧食報吿，張登鰲，蔡芻生，吳雲芳等八人之口頭質詢，曾問：（一）糧食部東北特派員，經淸查團澈查貪污有據，爲何法院不予起訴？（二）各地搶米風甚盛，有何改善辦法？（三）糧食部所定在各地征購糧食價格，與市價之差額甚大，以致農民殊多損失，糧部如何改善？（四）糧部經營之中糧公司，其營業如何，應予公開。（五）本京食米最大來源爲蕪湖，但安徽省政府當局禁止米出口，致使本京之食米發生問題，請問糧食部得知安徵省府當局此項措置否？試問安徽人是不是中國人，南京是不是中國的地方？最後由谷氏簡單作答，對各地征糧數目加以解釋。七時半散會，</p>

<h3>張羣報告全文　續昨日第一版　財政經濟</h3>
<p>現在中國財政經濟情形，可說是十分嚴重，雖然我們能稱以農立國，可是即使在戰前，中國也不是一個衣食自給的國家，米麥與棉花，都需要一部份仰給於國外。這一次對日八年戰爭的結果，我們的損失據本院賠償委會初步佔計的數字，直接損失約三三十一億美元，間接損失約二百零四億美元，戰費損失四十一億美元，東北各省及共軍佔領區的損失，尚沒有估計在內，戰爭結東後，因爲國內的分裂與動亂，國內生產繼續萎縮下去，物便不斷上騰，交通到處破壞，人民生活困苦，這種凋蔽的經濟，自然及映到財政上來。本年度國家歲入歲出總澦算業已送請貴會駐會委員會作初步審核，當時所列歲出預算，原爲九萬三千多億，因爲物價繼續上漲，到今年四月底，平均每月超支九千億元，以此數字推算，到今年年底，可能達到二十萬億，而在歲入方面，收入列七萬三千餘億，縱然因爲國外匯率關整，從價稅收增收，照現在估計，可能加到十萬億，再加上本年發行的美金公債與美金庫券共四億（約法幣四萬八千億），與歲出相對照，仍然是不數很多，有賴於國營事業及剩餘物賣之處理來彌補。物價如再上漲，則不敷之數更增加。眼前的財政病與經濟病，可說是互爲因果，開源節流，平衡預算，實在是很難的事，然在這種情形下，無論如何，政府對於財政的辦法，祗有一方面儘量謀增加收入，一方面儘量節省支出，凡省的錢，都儘量節省，不急之關根本的興作，都儘量罷除，用一切毅力與決心，來求得預算漸趨平衡·在本年二月頭佈的經濟緊急措施方案中，首先提出的辦法，還是平衡預算，可見其重要性。因爲要經濟穩定，社會安定，政治能夠進步，建設能夠進行，不能不從平衡預算着手，一時做不到，也應該竭力減少預算中收支不發的差額。必須如此，才可以管制貨幣的發行，穩定幣值，為根本整理幣制的基礎。　（未完）</p>

<h3>我國對日本賠償問題的態度</h3>
<p>王外長日昨在參政會報告外交時，對於日本賠償問題，重言聲明我國的基本態度，其言曰：『至對於日本賠償問題，應一本正義與公道之要求，以謀得解決，盟邦所允許日本人民未來之生活水凖，亦應依此項原則，加以確定：中國抗戰最久，所受損失最大，就任何公道標準而言，中國在日本賠償總額中，自應獲得最大之比例。』同時王外長又表示希望這一個賠償問題能早日獲得合理公允的解決。其實在目前英美等國，對於這個問題，也是無不希望早日解決的。</p>
<p>英國下議院於十六日討論現行外交政策時，貝文外相對於英國在遠東的利益，表示特別關心，并謂英國希望早日締結對日和約，澳洲與加拿大對此，尤感關切。至以美國而論，馬歇爾國務卿自莫斯科返國後，就考慮如何起草對日和約的方式，盟國最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥，最近也一再呼籲，加速進行對日締結和約的工作。但是在這一連串的日本問題之中，最重要的一環，首推日本的賠償問題，實為對日和約的核心；這個問題則對和約就不易起草成功。所以馬歇爾國務卿乃於五月五日召開遠東委員會，聽取十一國代表的意見，以決定分配日本賠償品之百分比例，從而使這個複雜的問題，獲得局部的解決；詎意澳洲代表，堅持着賠償問題應由對日和會解決的主張，因此遠東委員會乃無結果而散。其後蘇聯又聲明態度，對於日本賠償問題，也主張從日本的現行生產中提取賠款，使這個賠償問題的僵局，更無法打開。</p>
<p>但是美國外交局仍是千方百計，終想打開盟國對日賠償要求的僵局，所以遠東委員會在無結果而散之後，於最近一星期內，又繼續開會，並已商有協議三點：（一）將日本所有流動查金，儘先作爲償付美國佔領費及救濟費之用；（二）賠償物資之搬移，不得妨礙日本人民以一九三四年爲基準之最低限度之生活標準；（三）各國要求賠償之比例，應以其實際所受之損失及其所作之貢獻標準，并以此作為今後討論的基礎。美國這種的努力，能否打開僵局？至少在目前，還是一個嚴重的問題。就是在各國出席該會的代表，也不過分樂觀，一致認為，尚須若干月，始能商獲成議。但是這個問題，一再延宕，遲遲不能解決，最受其影響的，莫過於中國，今日之中國不僅希望遠東早日獲致永久和平；而且也急需自日本取得賠償物資。所以這個間題，是不容我們忽視的。</p>
<p>第一，關於盟國分配日本賠償物資的百分比問題；我國政府早已發表聲明：卽『我國抗戰最久，損失最重，日本對盟國之賠償，我國自應享有優越之比額及優先受償之權利；』這種說法可謂理直氣壯，使各盟國不能不表示贊同。緣自七七事變發生，以至抗戰勝利結束，公私物資所受損失，總計不下三百萬萬美元，軍民的死傷以及國家軍費的支出，尚不計算在內。而今我國在創鉅痛深之餘，從事於戰後復興工作，不論在物資上經濟上，無不需要外來的協助，對日要求優先受償及優越比額，均在情理之中。我國駐日代表賠償組長吳半農氏，曾於五月十日在大阪發表談話稱：『中國希望能自日本現行生產中提取賠償，中國需要自日本獲得立即可以應用之物資；中國并希望能立即獲得一切日用品，作為中國所應得之賠款的一部分，例如布疋·火車龍頭·鋼軌以及日本工廠所能生產之其他物資。』這一段話，可以代表中國政府眞正的態度。不過我國駐日代表廈在東京，始終處於被動的地位，而且我們代表團的意見，向不為各方所重視；所以我們不得不請求政府向麥帥總部提交涉，尤其是對於下冽二事不可不據理力爭：（一）日本要求麥帥總部核減先將賠償品百分之州分配與中菲等國的數目；（二）聞美國新方案規定各國的比率，美國為百分之三豐功厚利上，中國為百分之二十七，其他各國合計為百分之三十九。</p>
<p>第二是美蘇兩國對於日本賠償問題意見完全相左的問題；我國應該採取超然態度，對於任何問題，不問美蘇的意見如何？我們的態度終應該以自己的利害為前提。例如蘇聯將東北的工業設備，搬走一空，總值在二十萬萬美元以上；在蘇聯說，這是蘇聯的「戰利品」，不能視爲日本賠償的物資，反對在其所應得的賠償中扣除。此在美國，則堅持着東北的工業設備，是日本的資產，可作爲賠償之用，應從蘇聯所當分得的賠償中扣除。我國對淤這個問題的態度，早已有明朗的表示，憶在蘇聯搬走東北工業設備時，我國國內就發生愛國護權運動，對於蘇聯之所爲表示抗議。今後若討論到這個問題時，我國仍當保持着原來的立塲。再如從日本現行生產提取賠償問題，美個爲了減輕其佔領負担起見，不僅反對從日本現行生產提取賠款；而且主張將日本的工業生產的水準，從一九二八年提高到一九三四年的標準。此在蘇聯對於美國的主張，則堅決表示反對，並曾一再指斥美國當局，在經濟上縱容日本，戰敗國不欠將爲繁榮的天堂。我國對於這個問題，一則我國急需日本的賠償，自然贊成從日本現行生產中提出賠款：同時我國決不願容許日本保持高度的工業水準，使我國在經濟上仍受日本的壓迫。我們平心而論，杜魯門總統的賠償專員鮑萊的主張，將日本的工業生產水準恢復至一九二八年的標準，我們認爲最爲合理。我們爲本國的安全計，同時也為遠東的永久和平計，我國代表團必須據理力爭，不達目的不止。</p>
<p>要而言之，日本賠償的問題，不僅是對日和約的核心；而且也是遠東的安危所繫，與我國有着非常密切的關係，我國代表團自應放大眼光，一方面要據理力爭；務使各國尊重我國的賠償要求，使我國應得的利益，不受任何重大損失：另一方面也要運用手腕，以調和美蘇之間的意見，使這個問題，早日獲得合理公允的解決。</p>

<h3>日本四大黨一致支援下　片山哲當選首相　新閣陣容下週可望決定</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕衆議院廿三日下午七時舉行全體議員大會，用記名式選舉首相，結果片山哲在四百二十六票中得四百二十票，當選新憲法後之第一任日本首相。參院旋於七時卅七分開會，選舉首相，投票結果，片山在二百〇七票中得二百〇五票當選，八時〇五分散會。按片山哲現年五十九歲，和歌山人，於第三高等學校卒業後，入東京帝大，明治四十五年（一八九一年）在東大法科畢業。其後即在本縣執行律師業務，一八九八年到東京，在基督教青年會設法律事務所，是時起即投身社會運動。一九〇〇年任總同盟法律顧問，一九〇六年社會民衆黨成立，任書記長，其後又任社會大衆黨中央執行委員。在戰爭期中，廠身鄉間，埋頭讀書寫作。一九四五年十一月，任日本社會黨書訊長，去年九月，就任執行委員長。此次社會黨獲得第一黨地位後，社會黨元老安部機雄即推崇片山爲當今日本最適當之首相人選。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕片山哲在被選爲新首相後十分鐘，發表談話稱：「本日國會中被全體議員一致推選爲首相，不勝感激。爲打開日本民族之危機，與建立新日本，本人當出話至誠全力以赴」云。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕片山哲氐將於二十四日正式被親任爲首相後，向各黨總裁請求協力組閣，並定於正午召開社會黨中央執行委員會，決定今後之組閣方針，預定以首相官邸爲組閣本部。廿六日起正式開始組閣工作，將以旣定之政策協定及社會·民主·自由·國協四黨聯合方針進行，至於自由黨所提出之左派問題，亦將以該黨獨自之見解決定之。一般預料，約廿八日可以決定全部閣員名單。</p>
<h3>民主黨態度曖昧　新內閣危機四伏</h3>
<p>〔國際社東京廿三日電〕日四大政黨雖順利選定首相由片山出任，惟據此間熱悉政情者言，組閣前途仍橫有莫大難關。自由黨雖迭次表示支持片山，然在正副議長悉讓他黨，不得不走向在野黨地位之今日，顯難期其對社會黨作任何協力。以言民主黨，其在今日四黨會談時雖一變初衷，率先建議首相應讓諾片山，但曾強調須以四黨組閣爲條件，察其用意，當不外洞燭自由黨已無組閣之意向，面將不能組織四黨內閣之賣任諉卸於社會黨，並斥片山無能完成四黨聯合之救國內閣，以遂其某種企圖。故其結果，社會黨勢將被逼走上社會國協兩黨組閣之途徑，然就今日政局視之，僅由兩黨出而組閣，恐　成爲事實。</p>
<h3>美國各方重視時節經濟問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美政府經濟專家曾希望國會及民衆接受以數十億美元貸與及援助若干國家之計劃，本日因若干攻擊政府最烈之政敵亦重視世界經濟問題而表示無上欣慰。彼等對共和鯊總統候選人史泰遜之國外十年經濟計劃亦專心加以研究。經濟專家雖不贊成華萊士之激烈抨擊杜魯門主義，但私下承認華氏之不斷討論世界經濟問題與美國之責任問題，在獲得民衆擁護政府之全球經濟計劃方面，對彼等頗有裨助。解決世界經濟問題之計劃在數量方面幾日有增加，政府經濟專家認爲足以滿意者，即解決世界經濟之各項計劃在原則上及細節上雖互有不同，但俱皆承認此項問題，確屬存在，美國亦應在解決此一間題中担任重要角色。</p>
<h3>美國經濟集中形成嚴重威脅</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕戰後美國經濟實權集中於少數工業手中之空前現象，今已引起若干國會議員及社魯門總統經濟顧問之警覺。一輩經濟顧問均認爲此一現象乃對美國生活方式及小型私人企業之一種嚴重成脅。杜魯門總統前在二月間已曾要求國會研究反托辣斯新立法，以遏阻其發展。參院特別委員會研究小型私人企業問題所得之結論，聞亦認爲生產權集中在大工業手中，實爲全國將來之可怕問題。</p>
<h3>英閣新方案已送達印回領袖</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里北廿三日電〕據可靠方面稱：尼赫魯已接獲英內閣交回印度政權之新方案，其中預示如印度領袖不能接受英內閣原來之計　，則應組織劃分疆界，分酊國家資產，以及處理國防軍隊之三委員會。據悉：該方案亦已呈交回盟領袖真納與國防部長辛格等，據消息靈通方面稱：國大黨已表示　意接受英內閣之建議，而眞納則在任何際件下均不願加以接受。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕關係方面預料印度間題之發展當循下列四階段：（一）由印度領袖決定統一或分治。（二）假定決定分治，印督當召集印度領袖，提出在分治下使各主要民族均獲滿意之計戲。印督於此或當建議召開回盟制憲議會，以獲得回教徒代表民主的意思表示。（三）假定各領袖贊成此一建議，即可在短期內獲得印度各族代表之意見，英國澦料此一時期當不逾兩三個月。（四）召開印度最高領袖之會議，根據兩大制憲議會之反應，對印度計劃作最後之批准。</p>
<h3>世界貨幣基金團　貨欵法荷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕世界貨幣基金團今日宣佈，日以基金二千五百萬美元撥交法國，一千二百萬美金搬交荷蘭，用以羅定該兩國貨幣。基金團係四十四國於一九四四年組成，基金總類七十五億美元，協助會員國穩定外匯，籍以維持其貨幣價值。成立迄今，尚係初次撥付基金。</p>
<h3>美國對韓攻策不變決遵守莫斯科協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕國務院發言人今日重行申明，美國當與蘇聯共同努力，協助朝鮮建立統一民主之臨時政府，並已通知韓南美軍總督霍奇中將，美政府仍抱堅定政策，履行一九四五年莫斯料協定，使朝鮮全部受託管。先是電傳朝鮮右派領袖李承晚會宣稱，彼已與美國訂立密約，在韓南美軍佔領區建設獨立政府，故國務院有此申明。據新聞員懷德稱，關於朝鮮未來政府問題，美國並未與任何人訂立密約。</p>
<h3>美蘇混合委會開會期間　新聞可部份公開　蘇在該方面已稍作讓步</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿三日電〕美蘇混合委員會美國代表團主張會議公開，以便世界各報採訪消息，今日已獲一部份勝利，美方首席代表白朗於今日會議結束後，初次招待報界，報吿此事稱，委員會已允許渠非正式招待報界，報吿無秘密性之事項。委員會決定一切會議均不許記者旁聽，但雙方同意指定某次會議得予公開者除外，各小組會亦不許旁聽云。蘇方曾提議一切會議均對新聞記者公開，但就去年會議七週，僅發表七次公報之經騐而觀，今日之決議，已可認爲蘇方讓步。聞委員會明日將發表聯合公報，報吿最初兩次會議情形，又派定人員，成立三個小組：（一）研究與朝鮮政黨及社會團體商議之有關事項；（二）處理與臨時政府結構及籌備憲法政綱有關事項；（三）辦理臨時政府人員之獲得辦法，及臨時政府接替朝鮮南北兩部現政府職責之計劃。委員會將於蘇方首席代表希鐵柯夫召集時再度會議，按照兩國代表團預定辦法，希氏爲下次會議主席。</p>
<h3>首次會議經過良好</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿二日電〕美蘇混合委員會頃在此間開始會議，討論朝鮮問題，開會情形絕　保守秘密，本日會議歷三小時之久。事後美國代衣團團長白朗少將僅宣稱：混合委員會曾討論程序問題，己獲得極大之進展。據消息靈通人士談稱，該會本日討論，集中於報紙發佈新聞問題，將於明日對此採取決定。關於議程問題，亦曾討論及此，其最主要之一項，爲聽取朝鮮各政黨陳述意見問題。聞美蘇雙方代表均同意以諮詢權給予朝鮮各政黨，不間其爲左派或右派，甚至拒不接受莫斯科外長會議所草擬託管計劃之政黨，亦在此列。但朝鮮各政黨必須提供諾言，在混合委員會開會期間，不得舉行示成遊行，或發表演說，反對託管計劃。極端左派之政黨及民主黨甚至若干保守黨領袖，業已提供此種諾言，但極端右派之領袖則拒不提供諾言，其態度仍極強硬，其最主要之二人，爲朝鮮獨立黨中央委員會主席金九及獨立朝鮮勞工聯合會主席李承晚。兩氏年均六十，爲反對日本統治之元老，金九於一九四三年度曾代替李承晚出任在重慶之朝鮮流亡政府主席。金九及李承晚返國之後，均積極參加反對託管計劃之運動。彼等所持之立塲，即是否接受託管，須視美蘇雙方能否就霍琪將軍對於託管所下之定義成立協議而定，即託管乃援助之　，而非外　十涉之意是也。所開電費共五百萬美元</p>
<h3>韓北發電廠賬單　蘇聯已送達美方</h3>
<p>所開電費共五百萬美元</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕可　人士今日向聯合社承認，蘇聯對淤朝鮮北部佔領區各發電廠供應南部之電力，已有賬單送達美方，所開電費共五百萬美元。惟此訊尚未經此間官方證實。朝鮮境內大發電廠，多在北部，其藉電綫供應南部者，爲數頗大，且開曾有數度斷電，但並無蘇方故意閉斷電力之跡象，或謂斷電乃因電務人員缺乏經騐所致。又聞美陸軍已向美國民間營造商探詢是否有意在朝鮮南部建造發電廠，營造商對此甚少興趣。另據未體實消息，美佔領軍已考慮在美軍人與眷屬住宅區附近裝置活動發電機，以備斷電時供應電力。</p>
<h3>杜魯門即將向國會提出　西半球軍備標準化計劃　勃萊頓可能提出辭呈</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿徇陸海軍部，及國務院三方面所組織特委會之建議，決定於短期內向國會提出一項計劃，主張西半球各國軍備標準化，並在美國境內訓練南美各國之高級軍官。美外交政策發生此一重要演變之後，國務院南美洲事務帮辦勃萊頓可能辭職。按勃萊頓反對此項計劃已非一日，認爲此舉將使美國在南美洲不孚衆望。但馬歇爾對於勃萊頓所見則不以爲然。馬帥會向陸海軍部及國務院三方面所組織之特委會提供諾言，願向參院證明此項計劃與區域軍備之原則相符，不難加以通過。參院外委會主席即共和黨參議員范登堡亦曾提供諾言，將竭盡所能使參院之共和黨投票贊成此一「杜魯門計劃」。陸軍參謀總長艾森霍威爾元帥，亦認爲美國實施此種討劃，足以制止西半球各國之軍備競爭。</p>
<h3>土國將向美軍事團提出　軍事需要報告書　美援助希土計劃進行為順利</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉廿二日電〕據悉：土耳其參謀部已備具土國緊急軍事需要之報吿書，俟處理美國援土事宜之美軍事使命團抵土後，即可向其提出。該團一部份先遣團已於今日抵此，先遣團員共二十人，內陸軍官佐十一人，海軍官佐七人，國務院代表一人，團長爲美陸軍部參謀奧烈佛少將。該團將與美駐土大使威爾遜會商美國對土助助之使用方式，威爾遜及美國務院土耳其事務司長勃里頓已曾與土國負責方面舉行兩星期之初步談話，故料美軍事使命團於星期一開始與土方會談時，必能有順利之發展。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕政府今日加速執行四億美元援助希土方案，作爲防止共產主義與蘇聯勢力在中東擴張之壁壘。杜魯門總統在坎薩斯市簽署後十二小時之內，即已向復興公司取得貸款一億美元，以利進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕今日據悉：四億美元援助希土經費中，土耳其將獲得一億美元，全部用於使軍隊酊備現代化。其餘三億美元則給予希臘，在特設代表團經常監督下，分配於復興，救濟及軍事工作。此外，昨日國務院此准尚待總統簽署之三億五千萬美元國外救濟費中，希臘可望護得五千萬美元。</p>
<h3>二千萬美元將付予美國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕政府人士今日聲稱，美國援助希臘款項中一部份，將指定撥充償還三月三十一日以來英國耗於維持希臘軍隊之費用，計約二千萬美元。惟英國外交部對於美國業已同意之說，旣未予以證實，亦未予以否認</p>
<h3>希姆萊股肱　紐曼準將落網</h3>
<p>〔聯合社慕尼黑廿三日電〕今日此間宣布：美方戰罪調查員偵緝納粹秘密警察首腦希姆萊之股肱紐曼准將，已歷兩年，頃在巴伐利亞捕獲。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹調查團　完成報告書　希臘獲得道義上勝利</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕復且大學學生，昨日上午照常上課，不意於下午一時許，竟有校外學生多人到校煽動罷課，企圖擴大學潮，爲該校上課之多數學生反對，終至發生衝突。復旦學生嚴重則·姚孟涵身受重傷，當送市立第五醫院急治，其餘李懋勛·蘇長庚·侯震宇等多人則受輕傷。該管新市街警察分局接到報吿後，當派員警前往該校門外維持秩序，其後警察總局，亦派警備車二輛馳往鎭壓。當時行兇學生中有張恒昌·何淸瑞·劉玉華·凌又賢及呂幼威等五人爲反對罷課之學生認出，交予該分局拘押。其他企圖罷課學生，則仍留於該敎室中。該校校長章益及各院系主任，當召開行政會議，商討解決辦法。傍晚吳市長亦親往該校調查，經向該校長保證上課學生之安全·並將警察撤退，於晚九時許始獲解決。至記者截稿時止，尙有一百餘學生，留於敎室內未去。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該校安徽同學會等十餘團體，昨晚九時，成立「復旦大學五·二三血案後援會」，出席代表八十餘人，經決定請求治安當局及學校當局，嚴辦兇手，幷澈辦禍首。又文匯報記者二人，昨日前往該校採訪新聞時，亦被人毆打，經向吳市長申訴，吳氏備致慰問之意。</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕學潮演變至昨日，已形成主張復課及堅持罷課兩派學生之衝突，各校內部糾紛，愈演愈烈，上海法學院及復旦兩校，昨均發生主張復課學生被毆事件，同時交大，暨大等校少數學生所主持之「五·二〇慘案後援會」昨曾出動宣傳隊，乘大卡車二輛，分赴各大中學煽動罷課，但爲多數學校之同學所拒絕，故昨日雖爲「後援會」宣傳「總罷課」之日，而罷課情形，並不若一般揣測之嚴重。若干中學及女校，爲恐發生意外，於下午起無形停課，學生均離校返家。計昨日完全罷課者，大學方面爲交大，暨大，同濟，滬江，音專，大同，美專，中華工商等校。中學方面，罷課或停課者，有浦東，肇光，建承，儲能，華法，大同附中，麥倫，復且，實中，交通附中，崇德女中，養正，同濟附中，晋元，復旦附中等校。一部者，大學方面爲復旦，法學院，份停課東吳，同德等校，中學方面爲新建，育材，南洋女中，仁義，培明女中，吳興，智仁勇女中，啓秀，南洋模範等校。其他各校，均照常上課。茲分誌各校情况如下：</p>
<p>光華　光華大學昨仍照常上課，惟昨晨九時，曾因有少數學生至敎務處，阻止敎授至敎室上課，致一度發生紛擾，但旋即平息。昨日該校上課之學生，佔全數三分之二强，校方並於昨日發佈吿。勸導學生上課，其有不上課者，以曠課論。</p>
<p>商學院　上海商學院一部學生所組之銀行學會，昨發動召開全體大會，擬組織「後援會」，但該院大部同學，因已於日前簽各慰問中大同學，認爲正義之態度，業已表現，僉主以學業爲重，應照常上課，故昨日參加到會者極少，人數不足五分之一，與會者復大部反對參加本市各大學組織之「南京慘案後援會」，故僅決定再發電慰問中大受傷同學，及吿全國同學書，仍照常上課。交大學生百餘人，昨赴該校宣傳煽動罷課，爲該校拒絕，宣傳隊乃悻悻而去。</p>
<p>同德　同德醫學院昨由三年級學生發動罷課，聯合上醫交大學生宣傳隊，向其他各級宣傳，但未得響應，結果除三年級學生全體缺席外，全校上課如常</p>
<p>東吳　東吳大學文理學院，昨日起決定罷課二天，響應「慘案後援會」，該校法學院同學，則列舉（一）通電慰問中大受傷同學，（二）罷課，（三）請願三項辦法，作民意測驗，測騐結果，決定將取第一項辦法，通電慰問，故仍照常上課。</p>
<p>之江　之江大學學校當局昨發表消息稱：「之江大學學生，自治會自上月組織以來，因章程與敎育部頭佈之學生自治會規則不符，學校當局曾令修正，迄今尙未完成，其所產生之各級代表及職員，亦未正式就職，但該會近兩週來，已擅自行使職權，且與學校取對等地位，不聽指導，近更變本加厲，宣佈罷課，組織糾察隊，干涉同學自由，並威脅敎職員，橫加侮辱，行動出軌，無可理喻。學校不得已，已於五月二十一日根據部章，解散該會，並令學生在訓導處指導之下，重行改組。茲在風潮期中，學校對於留校學生，已通吿家屬，分別領回，免生意外，一俟風潮平息，再行通吿上課」。國立上海醫學院護校復課運動委員會，頃爲維護學業，反對罷課，特發表致同學家長書，籲請督促子弟，謹遵校規，即日復課。</p>
<p>約翰　罷課宣傳隊，昨日亦曾赴聖約翰大學宣傳，該校一千八百餘學生中，經簽名後主張罷課者，僅一百八十餘人，主張同情慰問而不罷課者三百餘人，故該校昨日仍上課如恒，張烱伯昨日前往演講，聽衆並不踴躍交通大學自治會，近日又在外大肆宣傳，昨晚邀請民盟份子平心君到校演講，煽動罷課，並於校內外張貼大輻漫畫，極盡侮蔑政府之能事，其中有漫畫十幅，上書「殺人者誰？政府！」激起一秦某同學之義憤，將其撕去，當被自治會內之特殊份子挾走，於身上遍處搜索，並加審問威脅，引起大多數同學之公憤，一時校內秩序大亂，軍警聞訊趕至，自治會命校警將校門緊閉。嗣由校長出面調解，始將秦放出。聞該校多數反罷課同學，已決定組織「交大學生正義大同盟」，積極展開護校復課，維護正義之奮鬥。客車誤點押運夫涉嫌</p>

<h3>同獄誘供智破命案　殺夫棄屍眞相大白</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕住居高橋江心川草鎭七甲七戶之崇明人黃德，妻張銀子，年二十二，姿容姣好，生性浪漫，致當地遊手好閒之徒，追求者頗不乏人。嗣被居住隱沙十號之黃根淸勾引成姦，久之，醜聲外揚，本夫黃德亦有所聞，惟苦無證據。直至去年七月間，卒被撞破，當時爲臉面計，亦不願有所聲張，除警告姦夫外，僅監視其妻行動。詛黃根淸深恐報復，頓懷殺心。待至去年十二月二十一日深夜，嗾使湯全生，施小義二人，將黃德誘出，</p>
<p>雇舟渡浦</p>
<p>，將其在荒僻之處用繩勒斃，埋屍於沙灘蘆葦中，意爲從此拔去眼中釘，即可高枕無憂，並爲萬　計，事後猶囑湯冒名去信，免其叔追究。詎天網恢恢，此姦夫謀殺親夫案，終爲現任高橋警分局長孫克强及刑事股長袁倫立警長江　幹員陳崑王，馬駿等幾經偵查，眞相大白。緣黃德</p>
<p>自失蹝後</p>
<p>，其叔曾四出派人尋找，爲時月餘，音信全無。其後忽接署名黃德之來信，略謂「我已由友人介紹在崇明某部隊中任事，一切安好勿念」云云。經核對其過去所奮筆跡，顯非其本人所書，且信中並無確實地址，遂益增疑竇。經與該鎭保長襲志良商討後，決向高橋警察局報吿，請求調查。當時分局長周志堅，即認爲其妻及房客施小義，涉有車大嫌疑。惟經傳訊後並無可疑之點，故即</p>
<p>交保釋出</p>
<p>。迨新局長上任，其叔因姪生死不明，心實不甘，最近再度具狀聲請覆查，冀求水落石出。經孫局長查閱存卷，認爲此案確有疑點，當派股長秘密偵查，於探悉張銀子與黃根淸有私通情事後，即於本月十日不動聲色，將此一對姦夫淫婦予以逮捕，並故意囚之一室，另命工役秦秋生化裝囚犯，同處其間，俾獲得二人眞實口供。是夜，秦即與黃閒談，詢其爲何被捕，黃以爲同是囚中人，竟直言不諱，謂余因與此婦通姦，而將其夫加以殺害，但余若始終不供，警局亦無可奈何。言下</p>
<p>頗示驕矜</p>
<p>之色。待至深夜，秦佯作入睡，詛黃色胆包天竟猶圖與婦苟且，至此秦即出示身份，並將彼等押至局長室。當晚由局長親自審問，黃雖狡滑，亦無可抵賴矣。翌晨，根據供詞在龍華附近將帮兇犯湯全生拘獲，復在新港將當日渡浦之船夫施小狗拘獲，一經偵訊，供詞大致相同，全案遂得大白。惟屍體雖經多日發掘，迄未尋獲，諒已爲江水冲去。該案現除帮兇之施小義尙在逃外，所有被捕男女人犯四名，已於日昨移送地檢處訊辦。</p>
<h3>行總滬署兒童福利股　招待慈幼各團體　宣佈決於本月底全部結束　介紹兒童福利促進會接辦</h3>

<h3>吳市長昨接見記者　報告處理學潮經過　為了維護上海四百萬市民安全　對陰謀份子煽動學潮決不姑縱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日上午十一時，在市府辦公處接見記者，報吿市府處理學潮經過如下：（一）前晚（廿二日）上海法學院發生學生互毆情事，原因起於有一部分學生，在校內公開煽動龍工罷市，當由學生三人，赴警察分局報吿後，當塲捕獲肇事學生十一人，已送法院究辦。罷工龍市，乃全體市民之損失，少數學生此種行動，顯已違反刑法及戒嚴法，妨害社會秩序。（二）本市同濟大學新生院，本已自動復課。昨日突有四十餘外來學生，赴該校煽動罷課，學校當局即正式請求市府予以保護，市府已令江灣該管分局嚴密保護，今後若再有此種情形發生，必予查究嚴辦。（三）大同大學，有少數學生，佔據校舍，市府於日前曾接獲該校校長胡敦復之函件後，即派參事葛克信赴該校勸導，吳市長於前日（廿二日）亦曾親赴該校視察，並令學生在規定時間內撤退，否則將拘辦爲首者。（四）上海醫學院學生自治會，日前在文匯報上給余一封公開信，要余答覆。須知市府與警備司令部所決定頒佈之四項辦法，皆係根據法律規定。按照違警法第五十二條，凡未經官府許可而自行開會者，警局機關有追詢之權。上海醫學院開會，旣未通知警局，亦未得院長同意，顯與違警法不合，自當以法律制裁。最後吳市長鄭重表示，上海四百萬市民，需要安定。市府爲維護四百萬市民之安全，決不能讓少數陰謀份子，妨害社會秩序，擾亂公共安寗，對於不遵守法律者，當予以法律制裁，決不姑縱。</p>
<h3>法學院發生互毆　行兇學生被拘訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海法學院新聞協會少數學生，於廿三日晨一時許，公開煽動罷課罷工罷市，爲多數學生反對，致發生互毆事件。學生毛永，周家驥，張益民等三人當受重傷。晨二時該管四川路警察分局得悉後，即出動員警將行兇學生十一人，予以拘訊經直認不諱。該管警局乃以「妨害社會秩序」罪送往地檢處究辦。事後該院院長，敎授及學生二百餘人，曾前往該局，要求釋放未果。被拘學生名單如下：李舒溪，鄭　安，楊輝，湯克非，虞孝龢，周祖基，夏蔚，蘇淑媛，屈元，曹師棠，田濟漪。大夏大學照常上課</p>
<h3>校外學生　煽動無効</h3>
<p>大夏大學照常上課</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午，曾有校外學生前往大夏大學，煽動龍課。因該校少數學生響應，致遭多數同學反對，一度引起騷動，但經該校當局勸止後，下午仍照常上課。</p>

<h3>具有有民主作風的　聖約翰學生　巍然獨立不受學潮襲擊</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕學潮澎湃聲中，本市大部份大學，差不多都受到些波動，更有不少學校的學生因意見不同發生了衝突，甚至發生毆打事件。惟有聖約翰大學却很民主地解決了「罷課」爭執。全校充滿了自由氣氛，繼續很安靜的在上課。</p>
<p>前天下午一部份學生舉行演講會，由馬叙倫學平心出席演講。但是並沒有引起同學多大興趣。馬叙倫講了三個鐘頭的「智仁勇」，會塲的空氣很平靜，坐在後面的同學，不少在看小說。李平心扯到了這次南京學潮和反內戰的話題上去的時候，曾經遭遇到不少人的「噓」聲。</p>
<p>後來更有交大學生上台演講，邀請聖約翰參加「總罷課」，並且立刻產生了「五廿案後援會」，參加的同學一共一百八十人。但是同時也成立了一個「護校會」。「護校會」在三百名同學的擁護下，決定反對罷課，但贊同發動捐款，慰問南京受傷學生。他們很民主的分別向全校一千八百位同學徴求意見，各自張貼標語，表示不同的立塲和行動。護校會很幽默的在大門口貼上了一張吿白：「敦請馬叙倫，李平心先生勿來校宣傳罷課，我們要安心讀書」。「五廿後援會」爲爭取羣衆，却宣傳說：「罷二天課，拖幾天，學分輕易的到手了」。「護校會」駁稱：「我們是來續書的，不是盜學分。看滬江，看交大，罷課結束無期，學分反而渺茫」。</p>
<p>宣傳自宣傳，意見儘可以不同，但行動取決於同學，大多數同學不願意罷課，所以他們終是很安靜的繼續在上課了。</p>
<h3>遠征軍今晩逢勁敵　征輪隊迎擊巨人　下午七時起在市體育館　賽前市長盃幼級組決賽</h3>
<p>征輪籃球隊來滬，五戰五勝，今日下午七時起，與本市西僑勁旅巨人隊，作第六次遠征賽於市體育館健身房，賽前增排市長盃幼級組決賽中法對綠傑一幕。市長盃幼級組自經角逐以來，幼一組冠軍爲中法所變，幼二組隊傑膺首席，兩分組冠軍，以三賽二勝制，決奪總錦標，首塲於今日六時開始，第二傷定卅日下午六時征輪對華聯比賽前舉行，今日原有乙組及工商組聯賽，一律改期，門票樓上五千，樓下八千元，於下午五時發售，體育館大門五時半開放，屆時除由憲警担任維持秩序外，仍請四維意子軍協助，裁判爲瞿鴻律劉荷生。</p>
<p>決心制敵</p>

<p>今晚關鍵</p>
<p>巨人在凱捷密洛夫之指示下，猛將如雲，浮尼克身高力大，陶勃林基短精悍，尤以長人谷佛爲最危險人物，屆時必有緊張演出。據圈內人士之預測，征輪今逢巨人，最可注目者，當爲屠文龍與谷佛，征輪能否獲勝，關鍵在屠文龍探籃之外，必須監視谷佛，控制籃下之球，他如蔡忠强之對陶勃林基，于瑞章之對耶龍，均勢均力敵者也。今日四綠陣容如下：</p>
<p>〔中法〕費建生，曹　，胡正康，李胥森，王慕平，張沛霖，竹關鴻，龔和華。</p>
<p>〔綠傑〕史濟林，王家勳，王家樂，高福麟，顧祖龍，沈堯雍，楊騎華，武達榮，葉維熊，周蔡生，徐紹安，汪啓昆，徐道廣</p>

<h3>紗布運往漢口管制辦法　紡管會陳請撤銷　輸往訶北東北各口岸之紗布　其手續與華南管制辦法相同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第卅五次例會，於昨日下午四時半，在市府會議室舉行，出席吳兼主委，李副主委，委魚吳味經，王啟宇，郭棣活，榮鴻元，唐星海，及該會業務威長劉文騰等，討論至五時半散會。重要決議案三起，分誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）第六區棉紡公會及本市機器染織業公會列舉理由，要求撤銷紗布運往漢口之管制辦法案。決議：通過陳請經濟部准予撤銷。</p>
<p>（二）紡管會每月檢騐各廠棉紗結果，常有若干紗廠，提請複騐案。決議：不能接受，惟可改進檢騐辦法。原定檢騐辦法，繫採筒管廿個，茲決定增加至四十個，俾所採紗樣，更較平均。</p>
<p>（三）討論推廣棉產及發展紡織事業基金保管委長會組織章程草案。決議：修正通過，待呈部核准後施行。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該會對紗布輪往河北東北各口岸之廠商由請案件，前因各方面對管制辦法，迭曾提請修改建議，故暫停進行審核。茲卅五次例會，已通過陳請撤銷漢口之管制辦法，故自即日起，即開始審核河北東北各口岸之申請案件，其手續與紗布驗往華南之管制辦法相同。又據估計：第二季（五月至七月）限額外棉，現已規定美金二千萬元，合外棉十萬包。而全國紗廠第二季實際所需之外棉，共需約五十二萬包，故頗感不敷需用。又聯總方面外棉，刻已有六萬包由國民營紗廠各半分配竣事。分配時（四月初）因棉花市價約八十萬元，故每担定價七十五萬元。茲以棉花市價已達一百七作十萬元，故今後配棉，將考慮調整價格云。</p>
<h3>統債仍疲　外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨疲而復後穩，僅統丁軋低稍多而已。五五二室五〇三室有納，三六〇室四二〇室則出，統丙晨開一三八〇〇元。自一四一〇〇元低至一三〇〇〇元。最後復在晨開價掙扎，結果較前收計甲乙丙戊均微降，統丁跌八百元，成交約六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨開低盤，廣帮錢兌帮賣意吿止後，證券帮亦出後急進，終吿回好。申電報價平庸，市勢尚鮮變化。怡紗晨開六五五〇〇元。即屬低價，高價達七一〇〇〇元，而後平和。結果較前收計英聯航業鋼業開平各漲半成強，會德鑒電話平平，餘者稍升。</p>
<h3>平行綫本票刺激人心　華股又止跌轉漲　多空之爭已息難為了散戶</h3>
<p>華股昨以各方興趣大減，塲內外成交淸閑，起仆遂倍形恍惚。廣幫有所吐出，紗廠幫尚具買胃，加上平行綫本票，有業已應市之說，疲後尚易回上。雜股情況依舊不振，中法藥房新股，前日甫經登塲，高價流出大批籌碼，，昨日竟吿跌停。</p>
<p>晨開情況寥落，頗見疲軟。遞永紗以七千元開盤後，一五七號二一八號七六號二二三號均售，退至六八八〇元低價。二三二號三六號八九號九一號一〇六號二二四二三七號俱進，升爲七二八〇元。中法首吿跌停，一五七號一四二號二二號九七號脫售，降爲七一五〇元。一一七號一四八號一四二號一〇四號三五號進至七三〇〇元。八五號六〇號三二號三六號尚加了結，曾回落至七〇五〇元以下。塲外報價高，經六五號二二四一一二號一六號一六〇號二三五號二三一號二三七號陸續買進，盤旋而升。傳平行綫本票有應市之謠，回漲到七四八〇元，傳多空已有携手合作訊，二二六號二二四號八五號八九號一九六號一四三號一六〇號一八八號進至七七三〇元。八五號二一九號二一八號一六五號八九號一五二號一五五號賣到七四五〇元以下。一四三號等仍進，永紗現貨仍吿漲停，臨收升至七六五〇元左右。結果較前收計永紗漲停。信和美亞新光景福各升半成強，新華漲一成，勤興微升，永公獨平，中法跌停，影饗同日上市之國貨，帶小半成。大通火柴微升，中絲平平，水泥跌半成，麗安跌一成弱，餘股各漲半成。遞交計永紗信和美亞永公景福各漲半成，新光微升，勤興微挫，塲外各老股計世界平平，五洲大生微升，餘均平疲。</p>
<h3>紗價回挫</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，晨開尚見平穩，後以布價下挫，執貨者將現貨吐出，籌碼充沛，價遂低落。四二支藍鳳最後爲一干二百萬元，比上日軋小十萬元，其餘二十支十六支紗俱回小五萬至一二十萬元不等。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨照例開售棉紗，價格均乏變動，共售八二六件，全部售予廠商，申購單共三六八張云。</p>
<h3>布市先疲後堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市況，業內以銀根仍緊，吐售不寂，客帮進意懈怠，更有染廠家回出白坯細布不少，市氣遂呈不振。十二磅龍頭細布由二十九萬六千元步小至二千元，紡建供售之Ｂ字五福細布有倒貼六八千元賣出者。四君子金印嗶幾低至廿八萬九千元。迨至午後，以蹬券有利買消息，故最後重見回好。十二磅龍頭細布價爲廿九萬八千元，比上日回升三千元一。五福廿八萬五千元，亦升六千元，其餘彩球藍鶴振中等細布，均升二至西千元。四君子嗶嘰回好五千元，斜紋元布及元貢緞亦軋好四五千元至一萬元左右，惟漂布及士林布等則呈軟勢。</p>
<h3>檢討收繭情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蠶絲麗銷協導委員會第四次會議，已定於今日上午十時，在老靶子路中蠶公司舉行。屆時將根據各方報吿，檢討收繭情形，同時並將討論加緊推進發放貸款。</p>
<p>又悉：迄目前爲止，經協導會核定且已向中國盤民銀行訂立貸款合約之廠商，已達五十二家。中農行發放貸款之兩行，江蘇佔二十家，浙江佔十六家。中農行迄已匯出之貸款，已超過三百億元。聞本年鮮繭價格，每擔自經定爲一百萬元後，　計蠶農之利潤，平均每擔可得三十萬元。故本年春兩貸款擴充爲二千億元後，預計蠶農直接受益之款額，將達六百億元云。</p>
<h3>捲烟跌多漲少</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市況，塲中添辦，零星居多。外埠同行拋出哈德門烟頗夥，大英烟拋貨較堅，午收比上日尚軋升二萬，下午以業內頭寸緊，辦胃呆，兼有供售，致復回挫，結果爲七百十五萬元，較之上日軋降十五萬元。老刀爲六百六十萬元，亦降七萬五千元。其餘華商烟美麗金鼠銀行白蘭地等各牌價一致回挫。惟十支五華雙斧，及廿支貨金龍克雷斯十字軍數牌微秀。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨市聽頭香煙，因外輪續有到港，來貨頗多，故三五牌烟又吿下瀉，價由四萬四千元跌至四萬二午元。　捲烟香料，市勢平席，價少變動。惟三角甘油，因洋行家略有拋售，致價回小，每聽自一百三十五萬元小至一百二十萬元。比上日下極十五萬元。</p>
<h3>食糖疲跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市　勞轉疲，公會劃判秘　砂初降萬元為四十萬〇五六千元，中途回至四十一萬元，後為四十萬〇七八千元，尚跌八九千元。二〇中砂白小萬餘元，為三十七萬元。汕青　德青級刁青均呌原價，乏成交。興化白三十八萬五千元至三十八萬元。興赤二十八萬五千元至二十八萬元。亦僅數十簍成交。福建片冰開五十八萬元，黃色普通建冰五十二萬元。</p>
<h3>米市瘋狂上漲　白粳又創新高價　每石跳至三十八萬五千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨瘋狂上漲，白粳創三十八萬五千元新高價，較上日漲起達四五萬元。市塲人心浮動，因產區節節報漲，故一經做開，漲勢即不可收拾。北市場有人操縱抬價，以踢皮球方式喊高至四十萬，當經拘送法辦。社會局長吳開先表示：對此輩囤積操縱危害民生之不法商人，應從嚴懲處。</p>
<p>昨市塲到貨因受隔夜風雨影響，較為稀洛。計南市塲三千六百六十三石七斗，北市塲二千九百七十八石五斗。高貨白粳南市做卅六萬五千元，北市做卅八萬五千元。</p>
<p>米價狂跳原因一斑</p>
<p>社會局糧食科長吉明　昨稱：產區米價隨本市上漲，本市再因產區價高而上漲，如此循環互爲因果，再加人爲因素在市塲操縱抬價，遂見節節上昇。食米雖已准恢復自由買賣，但應以維持合法利溜爲限，如有故意抬價操縱囤積，依照非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法，仍將嚴辦。</p>
<p>直接配米月內實行</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工廠學校直接酊售　米事，正在積極登記申請及審　中。一部份工廠呈報之職工人數，與前在社會局登記表中之人數當有懸殊，故手續在短期內未能辦竣。學校方面則由教育局代辦，一俟收齊後彙集轉送社會局審核。本月內可望能開始酊售。價格方面因近日米價狂漲，故傳糧食部有提高酊價至二十萬元一担說。昨據社會局長吳開先稱：已接糧食部來電指示，學校配米仍維持每石十六萬八千天價。工廠代辦米（即廠方托由社會局購買〕，則依每石二十四萬元計算。但如人力車夫碼頭工人等，無固定僱主或僱主不供伙食者，得以配米十六萬八千元算。</p>
<p>又貧民配米事，社會局前已擬定辦法，交由市府參事室研議，各有關機關定今日下午三時，在市府開會商討。</p>
<p>又訊：昨麵粉跟漲二三千元，麩皮亦轉挺秀，小包回升千元。豆餅供源充沛微漲三五百元。黃豆趨勢仍平，箓豆去化較懈，步削二三千元。紅糧到銷兩稀，市勢漲定。苞米北洋猛吸，飛騰一萬餘元。芝蔴洋莊略動，暗暗帶緊。生仁站局，赤豆緊俏。油市來貨尚續，呼吸甚微。豆油堅挺，生油平淡，清油不動，蔴油相仿，菜油平庸。</p>
<h3>四聯分處討論麥貸　五十八麵粉廠請貸三千二百億</h3>
<p>新　瞬即登塲，第四區麵粉工業同業公會爲便及早收購，增加生產起見，特請求四聯總處成立專案，辦理貸款，是項文件，已送達四聯分處。四聯分處即提交分處委員會討論。據負責人談：概會請求貸款數額，相當富龐大，共計三千二百餘億。每一粉廠貸予可購生產二十日原麥之款項，每生產五百包之粉廠，日需原麥三百市擔，假定新麥市價每市擔國幣十五萬元，則每五百包之廠，應貸國幣九億元，該會會員廠計有五十八廠，故貸款數額在三千二百億以上，時間六個月，利率照最低計算，以各廠動產不動產爲擔保品，又據另悉四聯總處爲配合國策，解決民食，表年六月曾舉辦麥貸，成立麥貸銀國。嗣以四區麵粉業公會意見未能一致，以致停辦。本年該會又提出請求，是否仍組銀團，或交由交行辦理，尚未決定。</p>
<h3>人絲上升綢貨下挫</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲又見上升，實因日來頗有實銷，而存貨甚少，執貨者不免居奇扳俏。一二〇號高山有光一千七百七十萬元開盤即有成交，旋復上升至八百萬元收盤。下午實銷戶因嫌價貴而束手，於是喊價漸低，最後為一千七百八十萬元。結果仍比上日高六十萬元。東洋及金三馬等各牌貨俱亦隨之上落，七五號半光喊便比上日大一百萬元，但未做開。　昨市綢貨繼續下挫，美亞被面塲內喊八百三十萬元，仍無交易，大誠格子璧縐開市光做三萬〇七百元，旋又節節下降，最後做三萬〇二百元收市，隔日期喊四百元，較上日小一千元之譜，人造絲貨原料雖見高昂，但因交易淸淡，售價不易提高。</p>
<p>昨市廠經寂靜，各級均無成交，喊價維持上日原盤，高檔另担Ｄ級貨做價一千九百五十萬元，Ｃ級貨一千九百八十萬元，有數包成交，爲外埠網廠帮所採購。</p>
<h3>溙業原料告竭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市造漆業公會頃以主要原料松香水存貨行將吿竭，而限於管制條例，進口困難，特呈請工商輔導處及轍管會，有所請求。略謂松香水向由德士古美孚亞細亞三公司供給，現存貨將竭，請公司繼續供給時，則以未得我國之許可證，無法啟運爲辭。並據德士古公司當事人云：此項原料，現存關棧者尚有千橋，須具許可證方能領出。故造漆業特呈文聲請設法，以免因原料不繼而停止生產。</p>
<h3>西服裏襯挺俏</h3>
<p>黑炭襯全毛高檔貨，趨勢特俏，售價向榮而頗軋缺，下檔貨產存充斥，價多平疲。法西襯需供相將，價平無甚榮辱。軟襯實銷續寡，除洪盛金錢牌外，悉多明平暗疲。花洋布銷暢貨缺，市價趨硬。袖裏綢求過於供，受絲紗原料及製工成本關係，兼小型廠家均乏能力織製，行情因之均多板堅。絲光羽紗產旺銷盛，茶會上喊價及源禺興零剪價，始終挺秀。紗背緞因實銷尚有待，開價者無幾。</p>
<h3>肥皂火柴疲滯</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂，以外埠同行獲得大量派貨，致銀根頭寸軋緊，遂在塲中拋售，喊價步降。一百二十塊一箱之黃祥茂皂，初由廿五萬四千元喊開，買戶觀望，下午收價爲廿五萬一千元。比上日收價軋小五千元，一百塊箱裝亦低五千元，其他固本箭刀光業等皂價，亦軋落三四千元。　火柴市面亦以去化呆滯，疲憊無神，新鳳凰及南京大華三牌，每箱比上日軋降二萬元，其餘新美麗老虎玫瑰等牌則仍平定。</p>
<h3>杉木回上</h3>
<p>木材市況，杉木市價曾漲至三千元後，稍回至二千六百元，昨因水脚提高，又回上爲二千八百元。洋松市氣尚平。</p>
<h3>工業原料進口　限額如何分配？　進出口商發表意見</h3>
<p>工業原料進口限額分配間題，市商會及工協會昨日會議決定將要求輸管會直接獲得原料進口分配權，意在避免進口商之中問牟利。記者頃特走訪進出口商業同業公會理事兼秘書長宋秉倫，承吿如下：</p>
<p>（一）自輸管會成立後對進口商之資格審查巳經嚴格甄別該會前辦理申請登記時，規定：（甲）進口商必須取得美國製造廠證明文件，承認該進口商爲駐華經理處，（乙）進口商業務範團，係根據一九四六年個別進口數量加以核定，酌量分別規定，今後進口數字，各進口商自經此預審後，目前仍能存在者，實有不可忽視之基礎，</p>
<p>（二）進出口商在業外人觀察，大都認爲中間牟利，徒多剝削，此種論調，實係不明國際貿易情形所致，工廠欲直接獲得進口原料分配權，其見解範圍極爲狹隘，我國各工業原料，大半仰給於國外，而此種原料，亦非一國所有工廠欲直接向國外訂購，（一）商情市價，隨時變動，情報未有如進口商之靈通，（二）外商襲造同一商品，質量亦各有不同，價格亦往往隨時變遷，此種專門商業上之見習，尤非老於經管國際貿易者不能熟諸其奧妙。</p>
<p>（三）國際貿易商，非但熱悉本國工業，且對國外工業亦所明悉，蓋進口尚營業範圍，訂購各種商品，隨時機動，並無固定，其酊備進口物品，包羅萬象，以供我各工業之需要，現工廠欲個別向外訂購，其困雖點，將來實有不堪言述者。</p>
<p>又訊：上海市進出口商業同業公會，昨日下午五時，舉行第十九次理監事聯席會議，理事長張煥章主席，討論議案多起，並以外界對進出口同業之立塲，容有未盡明瞭者，特由會致函輸管會執委會張主任委員，述明其大要如次：竊查進出口一集，在世界各國，咸視爲推行國策之工具，不惜以全力維護、助其發展。進出口商業發達，則銀行，保險，運輸，工廠各業，亦從而繁榮凡經營進出口業者，對於國外廠商之生產情形，產品標準，價格高下，必須　　。而對於國內工廠之實際情形，眞正需要，亦早有準確之調查與統計。且多與國外廠商有代理經理之關係，始可獲得準確市價，訂購物資，以供國內需要。故進出口業者實為珍惜外匯，不使虛糜之商業機構，奚可舍本逐末，而要求限額分配，交由各工業同業公會自主之理。且進口商均經鈞會之審核登記，爲合法之組識，所以能獲得分配額者，自經鈞會之慎東考慮給予，明知鈞會決不致輕信　言，率爾核准，以遂其自私之願。但本會爲維護國家經濟之繁榮，表明進出口同業之立塲起見，經提出第十九次理監事聯席會議，一致議決，電請鈞座鑒核，予以正義之主持，不勝翹企待命之至。（下略）</p>
<h3>煙煤高檔盤升</h3>
<p>煤市高檔貨烟煤，開平層阜新屑基隆屑等，因廠商漸動，同業納胃轉盛，市價緩緩盤升。低檔貨煙煤　城層鄱樂層，等因到貨絡　，市勢依然疲軟，行市仍於低檔　徊。白煤塊各路到貨漸多，然均爲品質低劣不合滬地實銷，故上檔貨焦作塊等行市，始終堅穩。天津營口各地有悅胃</p>
<h3>泗安新炒青</h3>
<p>天津營口各地有悅胃</p>
<p>專供外銷之紅綠茶，自海外來價逐步抽緊後，益使吐納談判不易趨近。乃邇來交易均若死灰，市勢奄無生氣。茲悉：茶葉出口商鑒於目前華茶外銷已瀕絕境，故速日召集同業，積極商討挽救辦法，俾資續圖生存·至於內銷花色，進出互有，過程缺乏變遷。頃據業中人云，刻下天津營口各地對本年度泗安新炒靑，甚有悅胃。異聞彼　價格，頗為苛刻，致一時恐未能暢銷。</p>
<h3>水泥業申請　准許石膏進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥業公會以石膏爲製造水泥之主要原料，而國內之石膏議量銳減，運輸困難，不敷應用，特呈請輪管會准予供給外匯允許進口。頃悉輸管會於本月五日批覆，謂當在「可能範圍內，量以核給」。</p>

<h3>英國太平洋艦隊總司令　包毅德訪問福州</h3>
<p>— 福州十九日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>福州方面十三日接得香港電訊，謂英國太平洋艦隊總司令包毅德中將Denis　Boyd將於十六日抵榕訪問，福州各界人士聽了這消息異常的興奮，像這樣身份的貴賓以善意，友誼的訪問福州，在戰後尙屬破題兒第一次！</p>
<p>提起包毅德將軍，大概留心二次大戰戰史與注意國際動態的人士都會曉得他是這次大戰中主特英國空軍作戰的大員，在對日對德的戰役中他指揮英國皇家海軍航空隊，以奇襲的戰略，騰予敵人以重創，在戰爭過程中，對大英帝國有過不朽的業績，乃由海軍航空隊司令晋升及太平洋艦隊總司令，賣授中將銜，擢居英國海軍界第五位名流，包氏年近六旬，服役英國海軍已有四十二年歷史。</p>
<p>貴賓蒞止　羣赴馬尾迎迓</p>
<p>十六日凌晨，福州各界首長及新聞界人士暨旅榕英僑一行卅餘人由南台分乘汽艇二艘，前往馬尾迎迓，包氏所乘坐艦阿勒脫（Alert）號於中午駛入閩江口，寄椗馬尾，歡迎人員即趨前登艦迎接，包氏偕同夫人，女公子等恭立艦旁接待，與來迎者一一握手爲禮，情况熱烈，與包氏同來者尙有白朗上校夫婦，都麗爾中校夫婦，加勒德中校，吉普遜上尉，密力根小姐等，這些人中於戰時都曾在中國海面與日本海軍作戰過，對於中國情形非常熟識，對於中國懷有一般的好感。包氏一行抵榕後，即下榻福州倉前山閩海關稅務司官邸及英商匯豐銀行。</p>
<p>留榕三日　拜謁「薩菩薩」</p>
<p>十六日下午五時，包氏偕隨員前往省府拜會劉主席，這個節目可忙壞了府內官員，不說措手不及，至少可說對此塲合不很熟識，臨時由憲兵團調來一排制服簇新配備齊全的憲兵權充儀仗隊，省府樂隊也臨時加以編整，是日下午四時適有協大全體學生組織「請米團」到達省府請願，劉主席趕忙以「滿口答應」的口吻送走學生，接着不久，貴賓到達，主席在主席會客室接待，賓主寒喧一香，是晚主席備中國式大菜，爲包氏夫婦洗塵，並邀海軍耆宿薩鎭冰，李世甲及省會各界首長作陪，席間觥籌交錯，像此國際性酒會，在福州倒是少見。</p>
<p>同日下午包氏拜訪中國海軍耆宿「薩菩薩」，薩氏是中國派往英國學習海軍之第一屆學生，包氏對　鎭冰上將向甚景仰，此次拜訪，執禮甚恭，並盛讀薩氏對創立中國海軍有不可磨滅之功績</p>
<p>十七日上午十時，劉主席。嚴市長及省府各廳廳長聯袂到達馬尾登艦回拜，並應邀在艦上作宴，同日下午包氏分訪旅榕英僑及各國駐榕領事，十八日上午艦上官兵在林森公園（原跑馬廳）舉行足球比賽，這是英國人最喜歡的運動，十九日離榕返港。</p>
<p>接見記者　寄望中國海軍</p>
<p>十八日晨，記者驅車到達倉前山包氏行館，取出一張名刺，臨時在背後加寫英文銜頭交侍者傳報，稍待將軍着便服出見，兩髮鬢白，身體魁偉，樣子顯得沉靜而嚴肅，十足表現出英國民族的個性，對記者來訪，表示很愉快，旋即開始了問答式的談話，包氏表示此次來榕訪問動機有三：（一）友誼的拜訪，（二）參觀馬尾軍港；（三）作普遍的遊歷，俾對職務有所俾益。同時，帶着他的夫人及愛女作海上的長途旅行。戰後至現在止，到過的地方計有新加坡，橫須賀，神戶，東京，秦皇島，北平，靑島，上海，南京，馬尼刺，曼谷等地，此次來榕尙屬首次，因爲對於中國海軍發源地的馬尾向具深刻之印象，久懷訪問福州之念。　對於太平洋艦隊的陣容，包氏也很詳細地爲記者說明：計有航空母艦二，巡洋艦四，戰鬥艦八，驅逐艦二，小砲艦十四及各型補助，運輸各艦若干配成一强大艦隊，這些艦隻分駐太平洋各戰略地帶，包氏本人則多駐節香港。</p>
<p>「戰後中國新海軍的建設，盟國是否願意協助？」記者這樣的詢問，他很客氣地答道：「中國的海軍過去曾强盛一時，惜因對日作戰之後，蒙受極大損失，中國是擁有極長海岸綫之國家，重建海軍不特在中國爲必要，在安定遠東局勢方面尤有重要之意養，希望中國國內早日和平，得能奠立重工業之基礎，而後發展海軍，盟國自願予中國以可能的協助，中國海員在英受訓皆有極好之成績，足以科式。」氏並盛橫馬尾之地位，譽爲海軍勝地，堪成中國一個優良軍港。</p>
<p>對於中國歷史最久，規模最大之本報，將軍很有興趣，記者帶去本報一份，贈與閱覽，並吿以本報行銷狀况後，握手言辭。臨別時，將軍並吿記者：即將返港南下南洋某地與參謀總長蒙哥馬利將軍會晤。</p>
<p>將軍來訪　增進中英友誼</p>
<p>中英兩國，向具有傳統深厚之友誼，此次大戰，居戰友地位，君子講患難之交，交於憂患，是最難得的。中國受其博大文化遺澤的影響，素重道義，此次大戰中，中國於國內戰塲危急之時，仍不忘英國盟友之困難，遣派精兵入緬解緬北之危，英國人當不會忘記者，戰後，爲了港九及其邊界的一些糾紛，使中英珍貴的友誼染上一層斑點，我們希望經過此次包毅德將軍善意的訪問華南各地後，能爲中英兩國的友誼有所促進，包毅德將軍此次蒞臨福州，福州三十餘萬市民無不興奮逾恒，讓這一份歡迎盟友的情誼交給包毅德將軍帶回英國。</p>
<h3>滇南十日　砂丁生活</h3>
<p>— 昆明十七日航訊　本報特派員徐繼</p>
<p>箇舊的人口，礦工是佔着百分之九十以上的數目，因之，箇舊錫業的盛衰，從人口的增减上，便可以很明顯地着出來。目前箇舊錫業雖然不景氣，不過還有不少的礦工正在努力支撑着這一個破落的局面。礦工的籍貫據蒙自　　上所　：「……初因方連洞為暱，四方來據者不下　萬人，楚居其七，江右居其三，山陝次之，別省又次之……」可見多來自湖南·湖北·江西·山西·陝西等省，可是近年來，雲南籍的礦工已經佔絕多數了。</p>
<p>這些背塃的砂丁們生活是苦到不能爲外人所想像吟，記者這次親自和他們作過口頭談話，而且也由其肌一切設施，得知砂丁們是如何艱苦地打發走那一串不見陽光的日子，深感勞工的福利是這樣剝蝕下去，那麼我們的建設工作眞是一件奢談的事情。</p>
<p>砂丁來源多係招募</p>
<p>箇舊礦上的砂丁是從來沒有精確地統計的，一批批地招募了來，不多時又一批批地倒了下去，礦主們讓他們的血汗塡滿了腰包，怎能有閑餘的心情來過問這些了不足道的事？然而在人道的立塲，我們是應該代爲呼籲的。</p>
<p>砂丁之就僱可以分爲招募與自動來廠兩種，只是後者爲數極少，僅佔百分之五左右，而招募同例在每年冬至節前後開始準備，招募人可以取得佣金，對於砂丁則只是稍付安　　用，　　　　黑奴一樣，上礦以後的生活便全由礦主支配了，形式上雖是採用契約辦法，而實質上砂丁們是從此失掉自由的。工作時間沒有規定，待遇更是無從說起，砂丁們從來沒有想到以後的生活，更無從安排自己的生活，他們的命邇掌握在礦主們手中，幾乎是生殺予奪，礦主都有絕對的權利。</p>
<p>窮困相連供人宰割</p>
<p>錫業公司的呂協理說：現在的砂丁生活已經改善多多了，過去的情景更敎人不能想像，因爲私人礦商唯利是圖，於是自然顧不得砂丁們的死活，而砂丁到礦上做工，又都是因爲經濟困難，貧無立錐之地，加上不織之無，生活目的及方式均極單純，所以供人宰割，從無怨尤。</p>
<p>洞裏乾坤暗無天日</p>
<p>砂丁的平均年齡多在二十一歲至四十歲之間，然而十二歲上下的小砂丁也不在少數，當記者繞過黃茅山礦區參觀私人塃洞時，曾親見一個背塃出洞時砂丁暈厥倒了下來，當然，洞中不見天日，而且路徑崎嶇曲折，他們在洞中的行程均以步作爲單位，艱苦由此可見，礦主們挖掘山　，以省　省工　　提，洞挖得很小，只能許人弓腰彎背才得進入，在泥土疏鬆的地方，也沒有用杉木架支撑砂丁們入洞背塃時，全憑步，一到裏邊便是呼吸不靈，砂土掉落到眼睛裏，口腔中，一直進入到肺部，因之砂丁們的眼疾特多，砂肺病也難倖免，因為砂石塡滿了肺部的空隙，一直到無聲的死亡爲止。</p>
<p>私人礦商對於砂丁們是很不合理的，招募到礦區以後，幾乎從此便失掉了自由，他們沒有　利想到今後的生活，每天和砂石泥土爲侶，很難見到陽光和充足的空氣，受不住壓榨的便私逃，可是要逃出磧主們的管轄，又是一件多麼艱難的事？如果抓了回來，苦頭是吃不盡的，甚至於帶着脚鐐手銬上工，這已經成爲十足的泅徒，要爲礦主們工作直到死爲止，在礦區中流行的一首歌謠是：「若是草皮尖子，兩頭不見日光，肩桃　箕一對，手拿索子一雙，夭乾若不挑够，下雨不能揉塃，春天日長夜短，金鷄一唱心慌，任你忍飢挨餓，起早睡晚如常，脚步稍走疲點，工頭噪駡可噹，砂丁天日不見，吃點老媽媽湯，手提汽燈一　，肩背好噹兩　，手扶哭喪棒子，耳插汗片亮湯（滇語稱光亮爲亮湯湯）鑲頭在後督率，要想偸懶無方，窩路狹小難走，左爬右跪難當，塃包越背越重，血汗流齊胸膛，來到槽門之處，抬頭始見日光，平地慢慢吸氣，咳嗽盡是泥漿，窩路好比地獄，出來好似還陽·」由這一首短短歌謠裏，我們自不難想見砂丁們的艱苦生活。</p>
<p>衣食住行全部一律</p>
<p>砂丁們的衣食住都是一律的，礦主發給每人蘇布背心一件，坐襪一雙（係用以在洞中背　休息時墊坐之用）下班衣一套，而且這些還必須在工資內分期扣除，此外可以領一盞小煤石燈，刮汗片一個，杵手一把，蔴布塃包一套，吃的方面更是終日如此，紅米飯和老媽媽湯（黃豆湯）是不能須臾離的，因爲二者之中都含有多量的維他命，砂丁們的營養便全仰給於此，而箇舊水量奇缺，飲料成爲一個最大的問題，若遇水荒之季，水均須拿來作爲揉洗塃礦之用，珍貴異常，砂丁們有「洗臉不喝湯，喝湯不洗臉」之諺。</p>
<p>砂丁們的住宿燒火會食之處，通稱伙房以亂石泥土砌成，房頂覆以稻軍，四壁無窗，陽光空氣均不充足，不過稍優於礦洞而已·刻毒的礦主甚至令人驢共居，當記者探身入內時，心惡欲吐，因爲裏面烟塵四起，而騾馬糞尿　流，有如置身於街頭公共厠所</p>
<p>洞道危險不乏冤魂</p>
<p>由於大多數廠尖缺乏洞道內之安全設備，以致砂丁每年因洞內坍塌傾覆等意外事件而死亡者，為數極多，而由於潮濕污穢等外傷使成皮膚病及其他疾病的，更是數見不鮮。礦區中傷寒，霍亂，痢疾等症流行，陽胃病，皮膚病，寄生虫病，呼吸器病等層出不窮，廠地有歌謠云：「廠地嚴潮濕，便溺無糞缸，飲食無節制，冷熱無靑黃，年年五六月內，病痛多得異常。你看荒郊野壩，尸駭盡棄道旁，試問誰無妻子？試問誰無爹娘？試問誰無惻隱？試問誰無心肝？覩此傷心慘狀，只爲銀錢兩忘！」由這一首短短的歌謠裏，便將砂了們悽慘的生活描露無遺。</p>
<p>公營礦商注意福利</p>
<p>錫業公司的管理當然要合理多多，而且他們對於砂丁的生活也竭力加以改善，比方實行八小時工作制便是一種公平的措施，另外有例假，星期休息，訂有加工及獎勵辦法，而且更組織工人勵進會，下設物品供應社，識字學校，工藝組，游藝組等等，務期礦工們在工作之餘，還能有福利的設備，至於醫藥衛生方面，也能特加注意，這都是目前箇舊礦區其他私營礦商所應該取法的地方。</p>
<p>總之，礦區裏的砂丁工作艱難，生活困苦是一點事實，爲了國民健康，勞工福利，從任一個觀點出發，我們都應該代爲呼籲，其目標則不外提高待遇，改善生活！</p>

<h3>籲請學界自制自肅</h3>
<p>編輯先生：近來各地學潮風起雲湧，已經由局部的要求，趨向一致的行動。聽他們的口號，和宣傳的詞句，已經越出國民道德和國家法律所許可的範圍，顯見是有人在幕後策動。誰都知道，國家在目前急需安定，安定之後，才可以從事建設。惟有中國共產黨和少數危險份子，別有作用，妄想奪取政權，所以自從前年八月起，政府雖迭次邀請中共首領商討和平大計，政府一再容讓，委曲求全，中共始終絕無誠意，得步進步，以致談判毫無結果。最近憲法已經國民大會通過，國民政府公佈。國民政府也已經改組，容納了許多其他黨派的人士，和社會賢達。由此可見：政府的確是在積極準備實施憲政。獨有中共及尾巴，不但不參加政府，而且還想推翻已經國大代表議決通過的憲法。共產軍隊到處騷擾，中共及其尾巴又在各大都市策動工人和學生實行罷工罷課，遊行示威，希圖擾亂治安，响應共軍。我們認爲民主應以法治爲　礎，實行民主如果蔑視法治，結果必然流爲暴民專制。現在各地學生的行動，包圍機關，漫駡長官，干涉學校行政，甚至强迫同學罷課，完全不顧法治，運反民主精神，顯然是越軌的行爲。善良的學生固然應予維護。暴徒爲什麼不予制裁？國家辦敎育，應當培養人才，不應當遷就暴徒。所以我們要求政府，不論任何階層，如果再有越軌行動，　可嚴辦。所以中共份，一　查明屬實，即予扣留，送赴共軍佔領區，不容其再在國民政府統治下各地區活動，庶幾風紀可以整飭，社會可以安定。鄙人及親戚中之子女，現在復且交大暨大求學者將近十人，因暴徒强迫罷課，甚至用手鎗威逼，不可理喻，不得已請假返家休息。甚盼政府當局，迅予處理，俾多數善良子弟，得繼續求學。貴報爲輿論權威，務請盡量鼓吹，督促政府從速處理，同時勸吿盲從的學生，救國要靠學問，勿爲野心份子所利用而作無謂的犧牲。（讀者章迪華敬啓）</p>

<h3>綠楊村——揚州續夢之十八</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>揚州城外的茶社與遊容能發生親密關係者，如綠楊村，香影廓，慶昇，治春，都在北郭的吊橋兩側。以渦去情形論，年靑人及婦女們多喜歡到綠楊村去，而老年人便樂於留在香影廊，該是因爲香影廓的歷史悠久，命名典雅，易於使彼等發抒懷古的幽情之故。</p>
<p>王漁洋的『紅橋懷古』浣溪沙詞有云：『北郭淸溪一帶流，紅楊風物眼中秋，綠楊城郭是揚州。』像是綠楊乃揚州特有的標識。揚州旣稱爲綠楊城郭，自然宜乎有一綠楊村茶社以資點綴。</p>
<p>不過昔日的綠楊村與現時的　楊村顯有不同之處。昔日的綠楊村，幾乎全部籠罩在柳烟中。每於樹梢高懸白色布旗，寫着鮮紅的『綠楊村』三字，遙遙看去，頗令人有『萬綠叢中紅一點，動人春色不須多』之感。記得先父曾指此『綠楊村』三字，間筆者『白旗紅字綠楊村』，可對何語。當時苦思不得，先父笑謂可對『靑石藍書丹桂嶺』。可借至今筆者還不知丹桂嶺是在何處。</p>
<p>綠楊村面臨城河，鄰近紅橋，後面土崗，便是通行大道，四圍無牆，僅於入口處橫架一木牌寫有『綠楊村』三字，這就算是招牌了。渦此有一小板橋，每當暮色已至，遊客散去，小立橋頭，低吟着『獨立小橋風滿袖，平林新月人歸後』詞句，一時會添得不少的詩情畫意。</p>
<p>渡橋後，沿河有一條短短土路，盡是停泊着大小遊船，比較姣好的船孃多在這裏等待着顧客，另一面是短短竹籬，竹籬之內，有一土丘，并且有亭翼然，土丘上下，雜植竹木，許多人都喜留地區躺在藤椅上，一壁品茗，一壁從綠陰缺處閒覷着河上的遊船，會忘却時光的飛逝，也會忘却人世的紛擾。這是綠楊村最幽雅處，也正是綠楊村最引人入勝處。</p>
<p>此外，由小橋下引水入內，成一小小荷池，荷池的北面，有幾間矮屋。每間朝南，都是短短的欄杆，裏面放着竹製的桌椅。從這裏面，可以看到往來於綠楊村的茶客，也可遙遙的看到河上的遊船。這是携帶眷屬的人們喜歡逗留處所，也是情侶喁喁細語的樂地。土路盡處更有一座極大的敞廳。靠河的一面可以垂釣。稀疏的釣竿襯映在綠水的上面，在垂釣者固有濠梁之樂，而在遊客見之，亦覺風雅宜人。其餘還有些別個賣茶的房屋，祇是部在裏身，與河上相隔較遠，從遊賞的觀點上論，總不及上述三處的</p>
<p>可惜這些情形都成過去了。綠楊村裏的短短土路，已變成行人大道，不見小橋，也不見竹籬。竹木被砍伐的很多，更無楊柳籠烟，加以臨河一面，團以短垣，偶入其問，固是一派蕭條景象，更有娜板橋所謂『見天不大』之感。據云抗戰以後，巳經換了主人，或者新舊主人的心襟互異，這才使得綠楊村大異舊觀，固不僅因爲亂離的關係罷！</p>
<h3>藝術的境界</h3>
<p>— 喻蘅</p>
<p>由於藝術的的發達，彫刻，繪書等直觀的藝術，雖然也可以給人感覺上一部份的滿足，然而它們底境界，在它們底本質上，至多亦不過是達到「美」而已。但是單獨「美」的境界是狹隘的。所以若干唯美的作品，反不易爲大衆欣賞。</p>
<p>藝術的唯美性旣有了問題，當然非擴大其境界不可，於是眞的與善的兩種境界就出現了。這樣又充實了文藝的內涵。</p>
<h3>短簡</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>昨天起，你生命上最沉痛的日子，也將是我記憶最深的日子，同時，也更是我第一次仰見生命結束的最莊嚴的印象，我永不忘記的！</p>
<p>沒有一點虛假，昨天，我的心最況痛，因爲我是第一次遇見最慈祥的母親，最溫雅的母親，最開明的母親，慰慈！雖然這位母親是你的。但，從初一見面我們便種下了敬愛，有莊嚴又有情感，這樣的老人世界上的孩子們都愛的，我不是曾率眞的向你傾吐過羨慕？而你不是說：『世上的母親都是一樣的偉大嗎？』而曾幾何時……所以我不能禁我的淚珠，每一回憶增加一陣悲痛。</p>
<p>昨天，歸家久久猶未能抹去所歷情景，晨起，憶及慈祥的面容，溫和的微笑，輕輕的靜靜的語音，又禁不住的滴下了幾滴淚珠，慰慈！我轉想到你；猛然間的失掉了這麼多，這麽大，這麼深刻，這麼沉重，這麼重要的這一切，在每一觸景生情的時際，我想到你的悲哀！可憐的孩子，你怎麼受得了呵！可是，慰慈！我要勸慰你！生命是無情的，形體是不能常存的，軀殼是總要消失而毀減的，而老人家的精神的生命是活在你們每一個孩子的心靈裏的。</p>
<p>寫這幾行，我原想勸慰你，但至此竟不知如何措辭了！你是一個絕項聰明的，你會把這個紅塵世界所給你的悲哀，沉痛，都能從遠而解脫開的，你要想着媽媽仍活在這間房十裘，你的嗚咽她聽得見的，你的淚容她也會看得見的，所以你們要像平昔她慈愛着一樣的生活。</p>
<p>慰慈！多少次的我想到形體的無存，想到人生變幻的無常，想到生命毀減的無情！我的心靈要從這世界上逃出來，超昇出來，所以多少年來我不能像世俗一樣的生活着，多少年來，我仍不倦於寫作，做人，艱苦的追逐着一個理想，不朽的眞理，慰慈！靑春美貌是可愛的，動人的，但也是易逝的，所以也最靠不住。形體物質是不能永存的，所以牠要消逝，要毀減。任多少真心　愛，泣血號呼，也喚不回生命已逝的無情！帶去了最親愛的人和慈愛的心。這所以，多少年來，我寧受物質的艱苦，無窮的折磨的日子，也要追逐一種理想的精神的生命，那是常存永在，而不朽的！</p>
<p>我常想：倘使我早生二十年，以我的思想，情感，和性格，我一定會遁入空門皈依三實的。而在這時代，我是要不倦地不倔地追求一個永恒的不朽的存在。倘使你這樣想，想到了這些，你也許能稍減你心中的悲哀吧？你知道，媽媽是沒有去哩，媽媽是分散在你們的生命裏，因此，你要保重，珍貴你自已的！</p>
<p>我想好好的慰籍你，千萬的不要勾引你的傷心呵，可是，你假如想哭你就哭出來吧；好慰慈！哭出來你也許會好受一點的。但是，千萬要保重呵，不要讓媽媽在那世界裏躭心，要像媽媽在</p>
<p>這幾天，要去看你，寄我的時愛護着的一樣。</p>
<p>這幾天，要去看你，寄我的掛念給你，致意你們另外的三個人，祝福你們！</p>
<h3>廢物</h3>
<p>— 臧贊</p>
<p>在黃昏或薄暮，在市街或田野，我們時常碰見一個人，他帶着一個箧子，裏面滿塞着爲人丟棄的，而爲他所珍貴的廢物。</p>
<p>廢物嗎？除去了那些「廢物利用」之類的書本中論調而外，這些亳無用處的東西，決不是廢物，好像零與無窮大永沒有辦法捉摸，越是近乎無用的東西，越是能寄以無窮大的想望。</p>
<p>一片碎瓦，一粒江岸拾來的小石，一塊綠色玻璃瓶的碎片，一塊有花色的小布，一只洋鐵罐……如果人們還沒有忘記自已的童年，這些財富是會被珍藏在自已口袋裏的，有如成人帶有鎖論的皮包一樣。</p>
<p>在成了「大人」以後，偶爾又邂逅到這些塲合：看見兩個小孩對一個紙盒或一片草葉輕輕對話時，或許我們會笑了，不是會心的笑，而是覺得孩子們太幼稚了，在小孩變成大人後，我們聰明地以鈔票代替了那些廢物，鈔票是更爲貿用的。從此就將那屬於天真的幻想的門關閉了，可是這是關閉得了的嗎？</p>
<p>永遠不，一張郵票或截了角的戲票，一片楓葉或一片花瓣代替了那些玻璃與瓦片。</p>
<p>人們去下了這樣終又抬起了那樣，一直到老：老太婆有一串唸珠，老頭子有一件假古。一根頭髪，一個烟蒂，一撮泥沙都成了世上最有意義的無價之實。</p>
<p>一隻香菌在一夜的功夫，做成了千萬片整齊的小摺，連最停大的彫塑家都感到驚奇。一朵花，一枚果實的造成是累年累月的工程。再細小微未的事物也可能包涵一個宇宙，再死板不能跳動的東西也賦有生命。</p>
<p>這生命，這宇宙與其說在這些事物之上，不如說在我們的心中。人生總要有個依憑，但一個知交，一個愛人，任何人也沒有如這些小事物來得忠心。</p>
<p>一粒沙包括了一個世界。一撮泥土，燃起了音樂家的熱情，一片遼闊的土地的苦艱與歡樂；一曲懷戀，憤怒的作品就此出現了。一撮泥土，落在彫塑家的手裏，他就捏成了自已的想望，一個「學西」，一個「巴　扎克」，就從他手中流出。</p>
<p>珍視這些微末的東西吧，不要為那拾荒貨的暗笑。</p>
<h3>詩瑣談</h3>

<h3>碧湘閣詞</h3>
<p>— 陳家慶</p>
<p>滿庭芳　坐月</p>
<p>露濕吟屑，寒侵玉臂；一輸界破靑天。蘭干倚處，花影自娟娟；萬里長空如水，遙山外，非霧非烟；舉杯祝，良宵三五，人月正雙圓。纏綿，無限意，難傳毫素，漫賦銀箋；但盈盈坐對，暗惜芳妍；欲喚嫦娥起舞，蟾宮遠，誰集羣仙？凝眸處，含情欲語，幽賞不成眠。</p>
<p>楚江秋澹，正暮天雲淨，薄寒時節，負手西風來又去，驚起經霜紅葉；野草縈黃，疎林褪碧，一路烟村闊；豆花籬舍，是誰點染淸絕？却漢駒隙流光，童年回首，歲序成空閱；欲倩魯戈留落照，喚醒中原豪傑；如此山川，依然風物，忍見金甌缺？歸途無語，滿襟篩碎明月。</p>
<h3>莎士比亞：十四行詩第五十七首</h3>
<p>— 眞勤試譯</p>
<p>做了你底奴隸，我能幹什麽，要是不伺候你，隨你底高興？我底時間根本就不算什麼，我也沒事做，只等待你命令，我底王帝！當我爲你守着時鐘，我也不敢咒罵那無盡的時間，也不說心酸的別離底苦痛。要是一旦你對你僕人說了再見！我也不敢帶着嫉妒向你究探你去了哪里，或猜測你底情彩，只像悲傷的奴隸般，亳無想念，只想：你使你周圍的人們多懽忻。愛眞是像優瓜，不管你做什麽，他總以爲你存心好，沒什麽。就迎銅，石，土地，或是浩瀚的大波，都不能夠不議死亡來加以統治，那麼，美，她底力量比花兒更柔弱，怎麽能夠來抗拒那嚴厲的一死？哦，夏“甜蜜的呼息怎麼能支持一天一天的時間來猛烈地攻擎，當那不論它有多麽強固的磐石或堅牢的鋼門都須被時問毀滅？哦，可怕的沉思！那時間底至實，唉！怎能躲掉不被收進時間底箱子？哪隻粗臂能拉他飛快的脚回來？誰能把他掠奪美物的行爲禁止？哦，沒人能夠，除非這奇踏有能力，使我底愛在文墨之中永遠明麗。當我死了，別再爲我悲哀，只要你聽見喪鐘怨抑地警吿這世界說我已離開罪　去和惡虫住在一起。你　這首詩時，不要想到寫它的手；因爲我太愛你，假使你想到我就要苦惱，我願被忘在你底甜思裏。哦，我說，你看到這首詩時，如果我巳經和泥土共躺；那麽請不要唸我底名字；最好你底愛也跟我同葬；怕聰明人看穿你底嘆息，在我死後拿我來奚落你。</p>
<p>第七十三省你在我身上可以看到這個季候，當黃葉全巳落光，或者還有　張掛在那顫抖在寒冷之中的樹枝頭昨日還有好歌鳥的荒涼的唱詩壇。你在我身上可看到這樣的傍晚：當夕陽底光已經向西方下況，像是死神底化身的黑夜，慢慢逐走黃昏，把一切鎖進了和平。你在我身上可以看到這種火光，它躺在自已底靑春底灰燼上燃燒，那像是它一定要死在上面的牀，跟着供它燒的燃料一同毀減掉。你見了這些，你底愛會更堅毅，好好地愛着你將失去的東西，</p>
<p>第八十七首有如波濤向岸石疾奔，是我底光陰奔向減亡；後一分鐘佔去前一分，接連向前競爭得匆忙。命星先在光海裏讓生，走向達到高峯的成熱，晦蝕偏偏來和他爭勝，時間就收回舊的禮物。時間刺破靑春底華緻，在美人額上掘起皺紋，吃掉希有的天生麗質，一切都被他用刀刈平。去他底毒手！我底詩到將來依然在讚美你好。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血516</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「噢，現在怎麽樣？」鶴見惶惶惑惑地。</p>
<p>「怕這幾個角色不聽話，又在淘氣了……可也不要緊……」</p>
<p>守一剛剛說到這裏，聽見房門上剝啄了兩下，不等答應，門已開了。來的乃是正岩；神情極其會惶。</p>
<p>「隊長，『〇十二』和『〇二』都有緊急秘書來，請隊長快點發令。他們說事情怕萬難挽回了！……他們猜想近衛閣已經簽署出發令了……。」說着，正岩的神色增加了緊張。</p>
<p>「知道了，老岩，我一人有什麽辦法，……可是一到十二點，不管這裏事情如何，萍子能不能出來，也不管青木長老的墨圈圈，藏着些什麼指示，我只好拿出我的老套頭，給他們一個大攪動。有效無效，那只好聽天由命了。」</p>
<p>鶴見的老套頭，當然不出利用電訊，造出幾種不利於日人發動大計的假消息，先給他們私慾的熊熊火焰上，儘量澆上幾盆涼水，也許可以掃掉些軍部的興頭，把預定計劃，等到暫停一時。</p>
<p>「現在可好辦了。」守一突地這麼說，「剛才我正在推想；假設我們道就趕到虹鎮去，這裏無人轉達消息，恐怕李明等兩面的人，和我們已經發動的兩股人手，到了約定時刻，在外灘呆等－他們必須候我們兩人到達後，才向虹鎮進發……設若我們這時，瞧，才九點三刻，設若我們不趕得去，又怕那羣淘氣，先去動手，誤了大事。」</p>
<p>原來守一沒有聽到鶴見的電話消息，這時又正在推想虹鎮方而的問題，心思專一，也沒有理會到正岩的報吿，和鶴見的意見，所以只于注意到當地的局面；「我看，我們這就動身，讓正岩守在這裏……他們如有電話來，就請他們快到虹鎮去接濟，告訴他們，計劃已有變動，我們不得來先趕去了。」</p>
<p>「何不現在就打電話到我們這三方面去，！百忍莊，韓方，本明－？」鶴見提議。</p>
<p>「來不及了，…他們都是預先分頭零碎出動，這時都在路上了，電話無從打起。……也行，就讓正岩先上外灘去」守一又改變了主意，「有咱們的人來，暗號是「０９１５，」通了暗號，就呌他們各自趕去，反正虹鎮方面，已經撒開了咱們的綫哨了。」</p>
<p>「隊長，」正岩駕着汽車，向外灘飛馳的當口，忽地喊着鶴見。</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「萬歲館那個下女，不是下值回家了嗎？」</p>
<p>〔知道的，你不是對我說過的嗎？」鶴見在後廂答着。</p>
<p>「隊長不是對那個下女，有些注意嗎？」</p>
<p>「是呀，我疑心她舉動不平常；不是說她也是韓方團體的工作老嗎？」</p>
<p>「正對，可是……」</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？」鶴見聽出了正岩話裏有話。</p>
<p>「她自殺了！」</p>
<p>「噢，……爲什麼？」鶴見吃了一驚</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>詩人說得好：</p>
<p>「在這樣一個世界裏，不論好意，善心，友說，愛情，忠誠，同情……在罪惡的私利，金錢，特權……等等旁邊，巳經完全失去了顏色，限前的貪慾和肌餓，不能用遙遠的愛情來療治。世俗所公認的價值是一些可觸摸的實物，而希望和理想被冷笑爲痴人說夢。其實，這些說夢者今天所歌詠着的一些似是虛空的東西，不就是未來的更眞實的實在，更完善的利益嗎？從古以來的殉這者在世俗的眼光下，豈不是一個連自已的生活都不會處理的人嗎？他們「侈談」美好的聲明，却連這破碎的一個也保不住。因此在今日的俗世中，眞正的虛華被看做實際，眞正的價值反被當做假象了。」</p>
<p>我有一個好朋友，在同一意養，解釋得也很透澈。他以爲以一個作家輪，病態（我想這兩個字是應該由讀者細細斟酌體味的。）不能算壞，而且在一種更廣泛更深切的意義上，一切的創作家都是病態的。你看，別人感不到的，他感到；別人不以爲大事件的，他以爲大事件；別人以爲平常，他却以爲不平常；別人以爲不值一笑，他却以爲大可痛哭……這不是病態是什麽？但正因爲他病態，所以他才比普通人感到的銳利，爆發的也才濃烈，於是給通常人在實生活裏以一種警醒，鼓舞，推動，和鞭策。這是一般詩人的眞價值。</p>

<h3>聽音專首次演奏會</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>國立上海音專已於本月十八·十九兩日在籣心舉行該校復員後的第一次師生演奏會了，除合唱節目外，兩天的節目不同，師生各佔一半，動員了八十人的合唱隊及該校名教授十人參加演奏，這是本年度上海樂壇的一件盛舉。</p>
<p>我聽了這次演奏，我不禁爲許多新的音樂人才正在孕育之中而狂喜。因爲篇幅有限，這裏我祇將幾個演奏成績最具特色的節目和演奏者作一概括的敘述。</p>
<p>關於學生方面，我目先要推存朱雅青的鋼琴獨奏，她獨奏巴哈與雷赫曼尼諾夫底「Ｅ長調序曲」和李斯特底「歌劇雷哥拉托（Rigoletto）意」兩曲，　法技巧的純孰州，理解樂曲的豐　能力，得到非常的成功，其中第二個曲子奏得極具吸引力，顯得爐火純靑。其次，男低音李志曙的獨唱，音色圓滿，音量寬大深宏，又能控制自如，而刻劃曲情，頗有技巧，無疑他將成爲我國一位傑出的男低音（Bass）。黃棠馨的小提琴獨奏，弓法指法均極靈活，很有希望成爲一個小提琴名手；她奏路德（Rede）的「A短調第七協奏曲」，優美動聽，尚能發揮樂曲的表情。</p>
<p>關於教授方面，這次很難得的我們聽到幾個名教授的獨奏和獨唱了。大提琴獨奏，杜克生（（Dukson）教授所奏的蕭邦底「降日長調夜曲」，感人至深，令人神往不已！使聽衆的情緒，浸入一種優柔恬靜而又稍帶憂鬱的樂音之中。富華（Foa）教授底小提琴獨奏，發揮了高度的技巧，和馬哥林斯基教授的鋼琴，配合得非常之好。馬哥林斯基夫人獨唱莫札特曼德爾遜及布拉姆斯的作品共五曲，這出色的抒情女高音，音色美麗，表情極佳，馬哥林斯基教授的伴奏，帮助了她不少，處處烘托出曲情的美感。我最受感動的却是馬哥林斯基底鋼琴獨奏，他獨奏李斯特自瓦格納的歌劇「飛行的荷蘭人」中改編的兩首鋼琴曲，千錘百鍊的技巧，宏大的氣魄，抓住了全塲的聽衆，緩徐處強弱分明，抑揚動聽；緊張處如雷霆萬鈞般地有力若，但每一個音都聽得淸楚，假閉眼靜聽，彷彿在聽近代鋼琴大師帕德來夫斯基（Paderewski）底一曲鋼琴獨奏一樣。而這次演奏會中唯一的「室樂」節目－三重奏，富華（小提琴），社克生（大提琴）和馬哥林斯基（鋼琴）三位教授合奏悲多芬的「降們長調三重奏」，極為精彩，他葛旣能各展所長，又能合作，使人聽了爲這樂聖的光輝有力的作品大受感動。</p>
<p>至於這次的合唱節目，兩天相同，演唱莫札特的「彌撒」曲中的「慈悲經」（Kyrie）和「羔羊經」（Agnus　Dei），由Ｂ朝祉教授指揮，第一天稍感聲部不和，第二天成績比較好，這兩首合唱由，充份地流露着虔誠深大與雄壯有力的宗教意味。</p>
<h3>高跟鞋</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲男：高跟鞋是誰發明的？</p>
<p>乙男：是一位漂亮的小姑娘，人家老是吻她的額頭。</p>
<h3>影迷</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲女：那是一顆掃帚星。</p>
<p>乙女：是一顆什麽？</p>
<p>甲女：一顆掃帶星。你總知道掃帚星是什麼吧？</p>
<p>乙女：不知道。</p>
<p>甲女：一顆後面拖着尾巴的明星，這個你難道都不曉得？</p>
<p>乙女：哦，原來是米老鼠。</p>
<h3>「嫦娥」</h3>
<p>— 馬高</p>
<p>作者利用民間傳說的故事寫成這個劇本，意思是想藉這個神話來諷刺「后羿式」的迷信武力的人物。這種想法是值得贊美的，並且它確乎有很多外表成功的地方，比如那些精湛的台詞，獲得了台下觀衆們銳敏的「時代感」的反映。然而平心靜氣的研究一下，就發現它不過是充份底表達了作者的小聰明·和炫耀才氣的機智而已·因爲在這裏面嫦娥的哀怨佔了過多的成份，以及過多的賣弄新奇的，要花腔的手法。作爲反抗的基本動力——人民，在這裏不渦是「反主爲客」的配角，它沒有更深的去接觸他們，描寫他們，以致顯得后羿之亡在這一批可憐虫的手裏有點不可能了。這不是創作的正途，過於迎合觀衆，搬弄技巧，利用觀衆的直感，是有投機套利的氣息點。</p>
<p>導演，在這裏顯得無組織能方，把這樣一個戲的體格都不曾確定，它應該是完整地風格化的，可是這戲的現狀是零亂混雜，佈景，服裝，演技，各顧各的我行我素。</p>
<p>演員，張伐是一個好材料，在后界的身上他下了很大的氣力，而且很有些精彩的地方。嫦娥，呂恩似乎不合適，外形太健壯，尤其和她那三個「小」姊姊放在一起，看起來很不舒服，在童年時期她的天眞活潑是「裝」出來的，而被立爲后之後，觀衆祗看見她在「演」古裝「戲」。夏天的吳剛在他幾個戲裏是比較差的一個，他習用了自己的慣技，又沒有新的發掘，故而毫不出色。賀路的逢蒙有剛直之氣，但筋肉不夠鬆弛，使得許多戲僵化了。</p>
<p>還有服裝的設計，我覺得有重新研究的必要，不要說嫦娥的年代太遠無從考據，就這樣隨隨便便的抄一個樣十。把它們和台上穴居式的佈景配在一起也不關和。尤其是一此所謂「龍套」演員，甚至二十世紀的汗背心也被觀衆看見了，似乎說不過去。</p>
<p>但，對這個戲我不說它是個壞戲，爲什麽！因爲它或多或少是跡近「現實」的，這從觀衆的反應上可以證明，要我說它是佳作實在也不願意，因爲它不完整，不深刻。</p>
<h3>布爾音敎授談吸煙</h3>
<p>— 寸園</p>
<p>每天的頭一枝烟爲什麼吸起來特別好渦？有人拿情這個問題去請教牛津大學藥學教授布爾音（J.H.Buyn）先生。他說，「在你明天早晨吸烟之前，可以先坐在椅子上數一數你的脈搏。數好了，再去吸你的烟。於是在十分鐘內，你會發現你的脈搏已開始升高，從每分鐘七十跳變到八十跳，甚至於九十跳了。同時，假如你願意請一位醫師或者護士來量一量你的血壓，那麼你就會發現你的血壓也升高了約一吋一。</p>
<p>「那麽，吸烟如果有害，究竟有些什麼害處呢」？對於這一問題，布爾音教授說，一我們現在已經能侈證明，抽烟時所吸入的尼古了從腦內垂體　中排出了一種我們呌做荷蘭　兩東西，使牠滲進了血液。</p>
<p>「這一種荷爾蒙對於心臟的影響是這樣的－心的作用能使血液過流全身，厚實的心壁輪番地一收一放，這心壁是由許多活着的細胞構成的，而每個細胞都需要氣氣的供給，才好去做牠的工作。所以在心壁內也就有一個徵細的血管的系統。</p>
<p>「從垂體腺出來的荷爾蒙能使這些血管變窄，而供應心臟的血液於是減少。因此，一位運動家在他操練的時候絕對不能吸烟，要吸烟，他心內的細胞就僅能獲得較少的血液，而他就不能跑得好了」。</p>
<p>那麼，對於吸烟是不是還有什麽科學的理由呢？布爾音教授的答案是：「我們知道，心壁內的血管，即冠狀血管，在五十歲至六十歲期中，往往會有病症。有些醫師早就懷疑吸烟對於這種心臟病很有關係，現在我們旣知道吸烟能使垂體腺的荷爾蒙滲入血液中去，那麼，對於他們的觀點，我們就容易看出來一個可能的解釋了。不過在吸烟和冠狀血管病之間究竟有無任何關係，這一點我們是還來能確切明瞭的」。</p>
<h3>小篆的整理和改革</h3>
<p>— 董夢</p>
<p>小篆在現今的文化上，還是有它重要的地位，決不能當作美術的欣賞品而忽略它；因爲官私印鑑，和最尊貴的國實「中華民國之豐」都是用小篆文字的。不過現今的小篆文字，一般印人要用着它，均依「證文解字」爲唯一的查考標本，別無其他的書籍可以來指示，因此關於應用而查考不出的小篆，也就祗好各憑着自己的心理來仿造。只要形式相似，近乎情理就算了。於是篆學淡近的印人，就刻就得雜亂無章，不成體統。況且印鑑是用在文字上以昭信守的，是何等的重要，豈可以讓印人隨意杜造，不過國家沒有規定的範本，這也難怪印人，因爲找不着顯路，以致人民的私章，錯誤百出，有時官印竟也有篆得不對的，所以篆體字在現世紀，旣經是印鑑的關係而還是需要它，那麼政府當局，趁此方式，編纂一部「國定中正篆字彙」，補入所缺的篆字，俾作萬世的國篆範本；不獨於文化上很有裨益，也是劃時代的改革，倒是很需要的一件事。</p>
<p>現在因爲限於篇幅的關係，就簡單的提出幾個字來研討：譬如姓卞的「卡」，關卡的「卡」，風帆的「帆」，這都是很普通的字，然而小篆裏竟沒有的沒有，借用的借用，其他如「氣」與「乞」「刀」與刁」均不分，「亨」「「享」「烹」一字三用等，諸如此類的很多，必需要把它補正和辨別才好。如果不佞的營見，政府當局採納的話；那時還要國內的篆學專家來鄭重的參考哩。</p>
<h3>神通的教育</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>不知是國家瑞祥之兆，也還是民族優越的結晶，這一向　，我們的國雅裏神童迭出幾個月前吧，河南某專員就與人爭奪神童；那孩子原是一個流浪的孤兒，但因爲是一個神童，養分與乾　大家爭着認親。後來台凝某處，又出了一位神童，據說已寫成了一部幾十萬字的小說。而且是反映時代，內容豐富的佳作。現在，我們在報上又看見有人介紹神童了。說他「　角就傅，即喜揮酒…蒼勁透逸，恍如龍舞鳳飛」，這當然是一位書法家了。</p>
<p>中國的神童，彷彿自古就人才輩出。據說王勃七歲時就作了滕王閣序，孔融，司馬光，韓愈這些人都是神童。現在教育文化較前進步，普及，神童自然也要增產。可是我奇怪的，這些神童一到後來，就多默默無聞。彷彿神童便只有「童而神之」；過了童年便也是一個普通的人了！或反不如常人。</p>
<p>照生物學的見解，凡是優良的種子，必定有優良的發生與成果。那末旣稱神童，將來亦必成大器。可是我們的神童爲什麽都曇花一現？真的像架於女人的諺語：「紅顏」必定薄命麼？也還是「小時了了」，大時未定了了呢？</p>
<p>關於「神童」而不「神人」這一個疑難，後來我在一位生物學家的口中得到解答。他說：你要一秣植物早開花結果！也並不是難事，你只要把牠的根多新喪幾根，或是弄毀了一些樹皮就是。不然，你就給他過分的滋養。不過這樣，牠的生命也不會經久的。因爲牠己失了適當的美料或受太多的恩惠！</p>
<p>於是我想到我們的神童的失落也是一樣！社會上對於一個「幼有異　」的孩子，他如果屬於財富和權貴的階級的，他的父母親戚自然的把他保藏在花房裏。如果他是出身貧賤之家，也有一批好心人來照料他·可是這些望子成龍的人，都希望自已趕快撈回一筆本錢，於是他們所施的教育，就是拔苗助長的手段。不是給神童以過分養料的，就是斷斷了他的根莖。這樣的神童，終於不是薄命，便至於一個「無神」的人了！</p>
<h3>以毒攻毒</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>太太，您出去以後，小少爺吞下了一個臭蟲。可是您別着急，我已給他吃了一包臭蟲粉。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>僅僅隔了一個多星期，柳州很怏的也繼桂林而爲直接感受敵騎威脅的危城了，於是照例再來一套疏散，緊急疏散，空襲，混亂，撤退，流亡……</p>
<p>這是一個酷熟的秋天的早上，在費了九牛二虎之力以後，老祝和劇團全班的人——包括蘭和緋緋——居然也陸續到達了金城江。</p>
<p>隔夜，籣已有一些發熱，什麽東西都沒有吃，便隨着大家爬上卡車出發；山風一陣陣的吹　着她，她覺得自己的身子在　抖，但她還是竭力鎮定，什麽話也不說，祇把一條白色的毛氈緊裹在身上，別人也多知道她向來不愛說話，因此誰也沒有注意到她在怕冷，發熱，顛抖。</p>
<p>精力交疲的緋緋就靠在她懷裏熟睡着，她的肥胖的腦袋壓在蘭的前胸上，使她覺得喘氣很為難，可是她不願打斷她愛女的甜睡，仍然勉強忍受着。</p>
<p>直到大家在金城江下車，老祝看到了她那慘自的容色，和搖晃着傑要倒下來的身子，才急急趕過去詢問。</p>
<p>當他攙扶她下車的時候，她的冰冷的手指更使他嚇一大跳。</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？你病得很不輕啊」！</p>
<p>蘭搖搖頭，向他苦笑了一笑。然而她畢竟不能再支撐了，老祝打算扶着她一起上軍站附近的小茶館去歇一歇，可是走不到四五步，蘭的身子突然往下一沉，差一些連老祝也躺倒。</p>
<p>「喂！老盧！怏來！怏來！」老祝立刻扔掉了左手裏的一口小提箱，用雙手把　抱住了，同時向走在前面的慮跛子狂喊。</p>
<p>「別慌！不害……事，我有……有一些頭暈」。蘭用極細的聲音說，還想安慰老祝。</p>
<p>老祝也不再跟她多說，忙和盧前分着左右，把她技了起來。</p>
<p>緋緋隨着張昌早和其餘的人坐在小茶館裏了，一瞧地媽變成這個機十，慌得立刻放聲大哭；幸而劇團裏人多，並且常在外面流浪，每個人多少全有一些應急的經騐，於是招呼開水的招呼開水，取藥的取取藥，哄排緋的哄緋緋……，終於在十數分鐘以後，把瀕於昏厥的蘭救醒了。</p>

<h3>Balancing Revenue and Expenditure to Stabilize Prices and Balance Payments: Mr. Yu Hung-chun Explains Financial Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Senate held its fifth meeting on the morning of the 23rd to hear a financial report from Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun. The meeting began at 9:20 AM, chaired by Zhang Boling. 286 senators were registered for the day, with 191 in attendance. Mr. Yu's report lasted approximately one hour, followed by written and oral inquiries from Senator Gu. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The sixth meeting convened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to continue oral inquiries.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun, in his financial report to the Senate on the morning of the 23rd, stated that "the severity of the current financial and economic situation is undeniable and should not be concealed." He claimed that the most serious financial problem is the issue of prices. The government is currently making earnest efforts to achieve a balance, and a balanced budget will also contribute to price stability. Mr. Yu then elaborated on the current financial situation and future efforts, stating that defense spending will account for 21.4%, even less than last year. In the total budget of over 930 billion for this year, defense spending accounts for 36%, less than in the past, while spending on education and culture has increased. Mr. Yu then analyzed revenue and expenditure, believing that the tax revenue sector could still be reorganized, estimated to exceed the original budget by over 300 billion. U.S. dollar bonds could yield over 400 billion, and revaluation of enemy and puppet assets could add another 200 billion. Combined with the original planned revenue of 700 billion, total revenue could reach over 1,700 billion. On the expenditure side, a total of 500 billion has been spent in the past four months, and approximately over 1,200 billion will be needed for the next eight months, plus another 200 billion, bringing the total to over 2,000 billion, a difference of over 300 billion from the revenue of over 1,700 billion. The question of how to bridge this gap is said to be of concern to all parties. To bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance, the authorities are seeking solutions in difficult circumstances. In the future, greater efforts will be made in tax collection, striving for substantial increases, and institutions will also be adjusted. In addition, the aim is to establish creditworthiness, issue public bonds, and sell enemy and puppet materials and surplus materials to increase revenue. As for expenditure, the authorities have made the utmost determination to save on all non-urgent and non-constructive expenditures. With both increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, it should be possible to overcome the difficulties. Mr. Yu explained that finance should be self-reliant; therefore, even if foreign debt is incurred, it will be used to complete post-war reconstruction and accelerate domestic economic stability, and will not be used to balance the budget. He then analyzed the improvement of the tax system, adjustment of tax collection agencies, stabilization of finance, and the situation of local finances one by one, pointing out that currency reform is indeed the most effective way to stabilize finance. The Ministry of Finance has been studying this issue in detail for the past few months, but this matter is of great importance and a concrete decision cannot be made until the appropriate time.</p>
<h3>Yu Hung-chun's Financial Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun gave a financial report at the fifth general meeting of the Senate on the morning of the 23rd. The original text is as follows: The severity of the current financial and economic problems cannot be denied or concealed. We recognize that the most pressing financial and economic problem now is the issue of prices. Therefore, everyone feels that how to stabilize prices and how to balance the budget should be the two major goals that the government strives to achieve. There is a correlation between the two because balancing the national budget can reduce currency issuance, and prices can be stabilized as a result. On the other hand, price stability also helps to balance the budget because when prices are stable, revenue and expenditure are easier to control, making it easier to achieve balance. For the past year, colleagues in the Ministry of Finance have been working in various ways towards these two major goals. To achieve these goals, the application of financial policy has, on the one hand, cooperated with the needs of national economic development, improved the tax system, and measured the taxpayers' ability to bear the burden, expanding various possible sources of income. On the other hand, it has strengthened financial control and supervised the use of funds to assist in production and construction. At the same time, in addition to taxes, public bonds and materials policies are used to supplement income with social idle funds, international surplus economic power, and the sale prices of enemy and puppet properties. In addition, adjustments to institutions, reforms of financial administration, rectification of tax officials' discipline, and enrichment of local financial work have all been earnestly promoted. However, national financial revenue and expenditure are inevitably affected by domestic political and economic conditions. Since the government implemented policies to increase revenue, annual tax and business income has increased significantly. However, after the victory, although the government repeatedly strived for domestic peace and unification, it has not been realized. Traffic is blocked, production stagnates, and the economic enterprises on which finance depends are greatly affected. Tax sources are naturally difficult to replenish, and expenditures for post-war recovery and pacification remain an important part of expenditures. At the same time, production and construction are necessary steps to prosper the economy, especially in pacification areas, where they must be actively promoted. Expenditures are huge, and the national treasury's revenue and expenditure cannot be fully matched. At the same time, due to the government's intention to increase revenue, the burden on the people cannot be fully and reasonably adjusted, that is, the work of cultivating tax sources has not been fully addressed, the policy of economic and financial coordination has not had a significant effect, the people's living standards have not been improved in a timely manner, and some financial measures have not been freed from the wartime control color, which is not in line with the nature of peacetime finance. These are all things that should be continuously improved in the future. The above report is a general outline of the current financial situation. Now, a simple report will be made on the actual situation of finance and finance: (1) The situation of national treasury revenue and expenditure. The national treasury revenue and expenditure are reported in two stages, the 35th and 36th years. The total national budget for the 35th year listed the expenditure part as over 252.49 billion yuan. In the course of the year, the actual expenditure was over 556.72 billion yuan, exceeding the original budget by over 276.77 billion yuan. The off-budget expenditure accounted for approximately 49.7% of the total expenditure. As for the income side, tax revenue was higher, followed by property and material sales revenue, accounting for 35.52%. The remainder was made up of debt income, accounting for 64.48%. We reviewed the budget and found that the reason why there was still a large deficit was that the Anti-Japanese War had just ended that year, domestic order had not been restored, military expenditure, post-war rehabilitation and relief expenditure, and adjustment of living allowances for civil servants and improvement of soldiers' treatment were huge, all of which were off-budget expenditures, and there was no room for saving. Even so, the revenue and expenditure deficit for that year has been reduced to 64.48%, which is an improvement compared with the deficit of 90% in the 34th year, the deficit of 80% in the 30th year, and the deficit of over 75% in previous years. The total budget for this year lists revenue and expenditure at over 937 billion yuan each. In the revenue part, tax revenue ranks first, accounting for 38.5% of the total, followed by property and material sales revenue, accounting for 27.2%, followed by public business surplus revenue, accounting for 9.2%, followed by requisition of in-kind income, accounting for 2.3%, and other income, accounting for 1.2%. Most of them are normal national income, totaling over 720 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 78.5% of the total revenue, which is much higher than last year. The remainder is still listed as debt income, totaling over 205 billion yuan, accounting for only 21.4% of the total revenue. As for the expenditure part, although defense expenditure is still higher, accounting for approximately 36% of the total expenditure, the percentage of expenditure compared with previous years has been greatly reduced. Construction expenditure accounts for 17%, rehabilitation and relief expenditure accounts for 15%, and ordinary government expenditure accounts for 13%. In this year's expenditure, military expenditure has been reduced, and construction expenditure, education and cultural expenditure, and expenditure on subsidies to provinces and cities have been increased. The budget allocation is more reasonable than in any previous year, which can truly reflect the government's focus of governance, and the deficit between revenue and expenditure is only over 20%, which is also the year with the smallest percentage of budget deficit in history. Nearly five months have passed this year. From January to April, it was originally a slow time. According to the national treasury figures, the income was over 200 billion yuan, and the expenditure was over 500 billion yuan. According to current estimates, tax revenue this year can exceed the original budget by 300 billion yuan. Enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials can increase revenue by over 200 billion yuan due to changes in the foreign exchange rate. U.S. dollar bonds and treasury bills can yield over 480 billion yuan. Together with the original total revenue budget, it may reach 1,700 billion yuan. On the expenditure side, the original budget listed over 937 billion yuan, but the expenditure for pacifying localities, restoring transportation, helping victims, and adjusting the treatment of civil and military officials is huge. It is estimated that approximately over 1,200 billion yuan will still be needed to be spent from May to the end of the year, totaling approximately over 1,800 billion yuan, plus an additional 200 billion yuan for reserve funds, totaling 2,000 billion yuan. After deducting the income of 1,700 billion yuan, the shortfall is being properly raised from financial sources to make up for it. Gentlemen, you must be very concerned about how to make up for the revenue and expenditure deficit. Government colleagues are also working hard on this issue. Balancing revenue and expenditure cannot be achieved by empty words. Politics, economy, and finance are interconnected. The peaceful unification of the country is certainly the premise for all effective construction measures, but we cannot think that just because the political situation is unstable, we will not try our best to come up with more effective remedial measures. We must seek a way out in a difficult situation. Therefore, in order to bring the national treasury's revenue and expenditure closer to balance, first, we must make greater efforts in taxation, and truly increase the proportion of direct taxes, so that the wealthy class can contribute to the country's reconstruction. Indirect taxes and consumption taxes should focus on heavy taxation of luxury goods and non-essential goods. At the same time, adjust the collection agency, strictly control tax sources, simplify collection procedures, eliminate malpractices, and enrich tax revenue. Second, establish creditworthiness, promote the public bond policy, and accelerate the sale of (1) enemy and puppet industries, (2) surplus materials, and (3) production enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government. On the expenditure side, the government has made the greatest determination to save or stop all expenditures that are not urgently needed by the country and that are not conducive to production and construction enterprises. In addition, national finance should respond to self-reliance, but European countries after the war, such as the United Kingdom and France, have followed the path of international cooperation and obtained assistance internationally. China's eight-year war of resistance was a great and painful experience. In the past, it made great contributions to world peace. The rapid restoration of China's economic order was the common hope of all friendly countries, and it was also related to the safety and prosperity of the world. Therefore, it is planned to consult abroad at an appropriate time in order to obtain financial assistance. However, it should be especially pointed out here that the government will never rely on foreign debt to make up for the shortage of expenses. What is hoped is that this will be used to promote the completion of the country's important construction as soon as possible during the post-war recovery period and accelerate the stability of the domestic economy.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Senate will hold the seventh and eighth meetings on the 24th, with reports on agriculture, forestry, and transportation in the morning, and reports on military affairs and post-war relief in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Chen Qitian Takes Office on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The new Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, is scheduled to take office at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 29th, and will hand over to the former Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu. Mr. Chen told reporters on the 23rd that he feels deeply responsible for taking office as Minister of Economic Affairs at a time when the domestic economic situation is quite serious, and hopes that people from all walks of life will give him instructions and assistance. Zhang Zizhu, Political Vice Minister of the ministry, and Zhu Shilong, Chief Secretary, will take office at the ministry on the 29th. Chang Ji-tooth is still in the United States and will be temporarily replaced by Liu Siying.</p>
<h3>Senators Question Finance, Focusing on Balancing the Budget</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] In the written and oral inquiries on finance raised at the Senate meetings on the 23rd, the issue of balancing the budget was given the most importance. Wu Wangji pointed out that if one wants to balance the budget, it is better to start with state-owned enterprises than to levy taxes. Are there any wasteful situations in public utilities such as postal and telecommunications, railways, and navigation? If so, how should they be rectified? All are worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Special Treasury Bills Should Be Carefully Considered</h3>
<p>The issue of public bonds, which is linked to balancing the budget, is also a focus of questioning. Chen Yaodong believes that special short-term treasury bills can be issued, because this move can not only allow legal tender to return to the cage and contract currency, but also allow idle funds to be incorporated into the right track. Zhu Huiqing holds the opposite view. Zhu pointed out that the issuance of U.S. dollar bonds has not been successful. In the past month and a half, less than 5% has been sold. If this example is followed, it will only be sold out after three years. The main reason for the sluggish sales is that the country has lost its credibility. Therefore, the issuance of special short-term treasury bills should be carefully considered. Pan Chaoying also believes that if new bonds are to be issued, it is necessary to start with the reorganization of old debts, because all public bonds are the people's hard-earned money and should be reasonably repaid. Senators from the private sector are most concerned about taxes. Zhao Xuefeng believes that if tax revenue is to increase, merchants will face more difficulties. As a result, the national treasury's revenue and expenditure cannot be increased, but only enrich the intermediaries. Zhang Liangxiu cited the real situation in South China, explaining the necessity of eliminating corruption.</p>
<h3>Banks' Business Operations Often Exceed the Scope</h3>
<p>Yin Shuxian and others expressed opinions on financial control, pointing out that the business operations of banks often exceed the scope, and even operate rice and coal, which should be restricted. Jiang Yiping and Wu Wangji also held the same view.</p>
<p>In addition, senators also raised questions about foreign exchange management, foreign exchange applications for overseas students, and paper for newspapers. More than 70 written and oral inquiries were raised successively.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Senate held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd, chaired by Lin Hu. Senators continued to conduct oral inquiries on the financial report, and Minister Yu gave oral answers on various points such as balancing the budget. Mr. Yu pointed out that taxation is the most stable and best way to increase national treasury revenue, because the country's expenditure is huge, and it would be very dangerous to rely entirely on issuance to make up for it. At the same time, issuing currency is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people, which is not as reasonable and fair as taxation.</p>
<h3>Use Direct Tax Methods to Restrict Wealthy Capital</h3>
<p>Some people advocate dealing with the wealthy, but in fact, the wealthy do not have words written on their foreheads, and they are good at breaking up the whole into parts. It is better to restrict them by direct tax methods, because this tax is progressive in nature. The larger the property, the more tax is paid, which is very fair. Regarding balancing the budget, the government is making the greatest efforts to ensure that revenue and expenditure are close to balance, because the authorities know that one more banknote means one more danger. The authorities' efforts are still nothing more than reorganizing taxes and selling enemy and puppet materials to allow legal tender to return to the cage and find ways to eliminate corruption.</p>
<h3>Senate Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Minister Yu Hung-chun reported on finance to the Senate on the 23rd, and said at the outset: "Hung-chun is ordered to report to your meeting, and I am willing to conduct a practical review and state frankly the financial situation in the past year." His sincere attitude made him the most popular minister in recent days.</p>
<p>Minister Yu's report was a series of figures. Senators who were concerned about balancing revenue and expenditure listened and took notes, and also made calculations in preparation for raising questions.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yu reported that a total of 300 tax officials had been dismissed and prosecuted in the past year for violating the law, corruption, and dereliction of duty. The number sounded alarming.</p>
<p>The issue of currency reform, which is of concern to all parties, was also mentioned in the financial report. Yu said that currency reform is the most effective way to stabilize finance, but this matter is of great importance and there cannot be a "concrete decision" until a "suitable time."</p>
<p>In a written inquiry, a senator considered some banks to be "bureaucratic capital's aerial fortresses."</p>
<p>Ye Suozhong and Shen Zhijing inquired about the future of the publishing industry due to financial problems. Shen Zhijing also pointed out that two people in the United Kingdom read one newspaper, and three people in the United States read one newspaper. He also said that this matter is related to culture. An colleague said: "Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai are distributed at the meeting, and each senator reads at least five newspapers, which shows that the level of senators has increased."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of whether to extend the time, Chairman Zhang Boling sought the opinions of the audience. Pan Chaoying said: "Each person's speaking time should be limited to five minutes, otherwise the Senate will not be able to finish its meeting in two or three months."</p>
<p>During oral inquiries, Yu Nanqiu said: "On the eve of the French Revolution, there were only six cents left in the national treasury. The government asked the nobles to take out money, but the nobles refused, and as a result, a revolution occurred. The nobles were the ones who suffered."</p>
<p>Pao Wu Chunwu asked, and Minister Yu said that he had not dealt with property due to technical difficulties. The Ministry of Finance has ways to deal with every grain of rice and every penny of the poor people in remote villages and deep mountains, but why is it difficult to investigate the wealth of the rich?</p>
<p>Chen Yaodong said that if currency and prices continue to run, the people will not be able to bear it. He advocated that extraordinary measures should be taken in extraordinary times, and effective measures should be taken against the powerful and privileged capital that endangers the national economy.</p>
<p>Zhao Shu, a representative from Yunnan, advocated publicizing financial figures. He said that if finance is not made public, it is enough for some people to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian, a representative from Wuxi, appeared in person to report on the results of running an industry in Wuxi. The conclusion was: "Only by running an industry can we solve all national crises." Wu Wangji criticized the financial sector for abandoning its proper business and engaging in speculation and profit-making, "making the financial sector fat and the people thin."</p>
<p>Some senators mentioned the issue of smuggling. Zhang Liangxiu reported on the situation in South China, saying that in Guangdong and other places, "smuggling" is done publicly, and as a result, it has become "official smuggling." These people came from the sky, so everyone gave them a nickname of "parachute unit."</p>
<p>Zhang also reported on the tax officials' corruption, saying: There is a saying in Guangdong called "three three three one." For a tax revenue, 30% is contributed to the superiors, 30% goes to the middlemen, 30% goes into private pockets, and the remaining 10% is paid to the government.</p>
<p>Xiao Yishan asked "three-dynasty veteran." Beijing is a cultural city, so why is so little newsprint allocated to it?</p>
<p>Zhou Qianchong believes that begging for a printing press is equivalent to suicide. A few months ago, a person whose salary could be worth 100 U.S. dollars could only be worth 30 or 40 U.S. dollars after several adjustments, which is not as good as the income of the hardest worker in the United States.</p>
<p>Many people cheered for Minister Yu. Zhang Qianhua hoped that the Ministry of Finance would show courage and hoped that Minister Yu would deal with the wealthy with the demeanor of a politician.</p>
<p>Minister Yu answered the senators' questions in ten points. He said "gentlemen" at least dozens of times in half an hour. Everything went smoothly all the way, but unexpectedly, in the last few minutes, a big wave was caused. Qian Gonglai and Huang Yuren got up to question several times, and the meeting was noisy. Regarding the fact that Director Dai of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance was often in Shanghai, Minister Yu pointed to the seat of the chief of the ministry and said, "Dai himself is here." When he spoke, he pointed to the seat of the chief, and the whole audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Minister Gu's report on food was read in one hour with a report of 20,000 to 30,000 words. An average of one or two hundred words per minute, no stenographer could record it. The reporters all put down their pens and rested. A senator asked in writing, hoping that Minister Gu would show his past style and kill a few field food officials.</p>
<h3>Senators Call for Peace and Will Submit Plans to the General Assembly Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Boling has already stated in his opening remarks that the theme of this Senate meeting will be peace first. When questioning politics, the senators' questioning focuses on peace talks. However, because the General Assembly is still in the reporting stage, the cases have not yet been submitted. It is reported that the China Democratic League's peace plan can be finalized on the 23rd and submitted to the General Assembly on the 24th. Xu Deheng's proposed peace plan has not yet been drafted, and Zhou Binglin has decided not to come to the south. In addition, Senators Xiao Lai, Hu Qiuyuan, Zhu Huiqing, Wu Yunzhu, Xi Lun, Liu Qirui, Duanmu Kai, etc. also submitted a reasonable peace plan to the General Assembly. The main text is to call for peace, promote peace, and use the country to teach the country's life and death. The methods are: (1) This meeting calls on the government and the CCP to call for peace and requires both parties to immediately cease fire on the spot. (2) The Senate will form a Peace Promotion Association, send appropriate candidates to solicit peace opinions from both parties, and study fair and reasonable peace plans. (3) The Senate will solicit the consent of both parties on this plan and reopen peace talks. (4) Those who refuse to call for peace and refuse peace talks are those who are responsible for undermining peace. The Senate should call on the people to abandon them together. Mr. Yu once again solemnly stated that the Ministry of Finance will never balance the budget with foreign debt. Regarding currency reform, Yu said: The situations in the Northeast and Taiwan are both expedient measures, and they should be reorganized after a considerable period of time. As for the requisition of foreign deposits, diplomacy has not been successful, and the answer received is "restricted by law, unable to assist." Regarding this matter, the government has stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan that incentives and threats should be used to promote such funds to be used for production purposes. Some senators asked about subsidies for state-owned enterprises. Mr. Yu said that this was a last resort for the government and that the authorities were considering new methods. The authorities are also paying close attention to smuggling, because the black market for foreign exchange cannot be eliminated if smuggling is not eliminated one day. The government has ordered the customs to strictly prevent and send personnel to Hong Kong to find ways to repair this loophole.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Gold Rush Case, It Is Being Handled by the Court</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu then answered questions about the gold case and the investigation into Yangtze and Zhongfu companies. Regarding the gold rush case, Mr. Yu replied simply that the matter is being handled by the court. Regarding the investigation of Yangtze and Zhongfu companies' purchase of refrigerators, Jeeps, and radios, Yu said that the Ministry of Finance was ordered to conduct the investigation jointly with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and is now responsible for instructing the customs to investigate. The Jeep imported by Zhongfu Company was shipped before April 29, 1946. It is believed that this case will be brought to light after a fair and thorough investigation. A senator asked whether the Governor of the Central Bank can concurrently serve as the chairman of other companies. Yu said that Yu had not heard that President Zhang had any such concurrent positions, and pointed out that the government had clearly ordered government officials not to run businesses concurrently. If there is such a situation, it should be dealt with according to law, but the President of the National Bank is not subject to the control of the Ministry of Finance. Yu replied to this point, and Huang Yuren continued to inquire about the affairs of Zhongfu and Yangtze companies, hoping to report to the Senate. Yu said that the Ministry of Finance was ordered to conduct a secret investigation. The information obtained should be reported to the government, which is a matter of course.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Has Investigated the Surplus Problem of China Textile</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu also answered questions about the payment of the surplus of China Textile Company to the national treasury. According to reports, the company only paid a surplus of 80 billion last year. The Ministry of Finance went to investigate. China Textile initially refused, but it was later found that the total surplus was 368.2 billion. After deducting the public accumulation fund, there should also be more than 240 billion, but China Textile has its own explanation.</p>
<p>Huang Yuren stood up again and raised questions about Lin Fengbao's appointment as a member of the National Bank's accounting committee, asking why Lin was reappointed to his post before Lin's old case was cleared, and the person who bailed out Lin was Yu. Huang hoped that Yu would explain. Yu said that this matter can be inquired to the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere at the Meeting Was Once Tense, and the Chairman Announced a Break</h3>
<p>Huang continued to inquire, and the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. At this time, Yu had returned to his original seat. Soon after, the chairman announced a break, and a storm subsided. It was already 5:30. Senators questioned the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Newspaper Imports: Tantamount to Crippling Democracy</h3>
<p>Councilor Questions Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the problem of insufficient newsprint imports, Councilor Shen Zhijing spoke about this at the Fifth General Assembly on the 23rd, stating that the current foreign exchange control policy imposes harsh restrictions on foreign exchange for paper imports. The monthly approved paper import quota is not even enough for the newspaper industry in Shanghai alone, let alone allowing provinces and cities to enjoy a share. If the government is truly moving towards a democratic path, newspapers, especially local newspapers, are indispensable tools. However, the current policy direction is full of rhetoric about democracy, while the financial and economic policies are ruthlessly destroying public opinion, the vanguard of democracy. A statistic was seen in the newspapers that Americans have one newspaper for every three people, and Britons have one newspaper for every two people. Even India, outside the five major powers, has one newspaper for every two hundred people. May I ask how many people in China, one of the five major powers, have one newspaper? Please consider and calculate whether the Ministry of Finance should increase foreign exchange for paper imports or abolish restrictions.</p>
<h3>Food Situation in Various Regions: Authorities Decide to Adjust and Regulate; Gu Zhenglun Responds to Inquiries at the参政会</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] During the Sixth General Assembly of the 参政会 on the 23rd, after the financial report inquiry was completed and a ten-minute break was taken, Minister Gu Zhenglun reported on food administration, explaining eight points including land tax collection in kind and price stabilization. He then listened to more than thirty written and oral inquiries. The issues raised by the councilors mainly focused on rice shortages and collection in kind. Representatives from the north mentioned the severe food shortage in North China and hoped for a speedy relief effort. He Jihong pointed out that the wheat in North China was only two inches tall, making famine inevitable. Sun Shengwu strongly advocated for relief in North China, stating the people's food situation was dire and hoping for food shipments to provide assistance. Councilors from Jin and Min provinces also reported on the local food situation, hoping the authorities would pay attention. Gu responded, saying that the authorities were constantly paying attention to the food situation in North China and had decided to ship 100,000 bags of flour to Tianjin, with further shipments to follow. Fujian and Guangdong have always lacked food, and the authorities have decided that, apart from military supplies, they will find ways to adjust and regulate surplus grain. Gu finally stated that 200,000 tons of foreign rice were on their way, which would greatly help China's food problem. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the food report, Zhang Deng'ao, Cai Chusheng, Wu Yunfang, and eight others made oral inquiries, asking: (1) The Northeast Special Commissioner of the Food Department was thoroughly investigated by the investigation team and found to have committed corruption. Why has the court not prosecuted him? (2) Rice grabbing is rampant in various places. What are the improvement measures? (3) The price set by the Food Department for purchasing grain in various places differs greatly from the market price, resulting in significant losses for farmers. How will the Food Department improve this? (4) How is the Central Grain Corporation, operated by the Food Department, doing? It should be made public. (5) The largest source of rice for this capital is Wuhu, but the Anhui Provincial Government authorities have banned rice exports, causing problems with the rice supply in this capital. Has the Food Department learned of this measure by the Anhui Provincial Government? Are the people of Anhui not Chinese, and is Nanjing not a part of China? Finally, Gu gave a brief answer, explaining the number of grains collected in various places. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Can Be Repaired Within the Year</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Councilors Wu Wangji and others recently proposed to the General Assembly that the government concentrate its efforts and repair the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as soon as possible to maintain transportation in Southeast China. According to people in the Ministry of Communications, the destruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was due to banditry, material shortages, and insufficient funding. It is determined that it can be repaired within this year.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 22nd] The newly appointed Chairman of Xinjiang Province, Maxwood, told reporters on the 22nd: "It is unprecedented for the Central Government to govern Xinjiang Province with the people of Xinjiang, which makes me feel a deep sense of responsibility and also shows the Central Government's goodwill towards the border areas.

<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Collect Rice in Southern Jiangsu; Provincial Government Orders Strict Prevention in Various Counties; Rice Prices in Wuxi and Suzhou Exceed 300,000</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, Twenty-third] The recording of the Provincial Government recently approved a telegram from the Capital Garrison Command, stating that according to reports, Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu recently entrusted coastal merchants in Nantong and other areas to purchase large quantities of rice in southern Jiangsu at a high price of 280,000 yuan per stone (equivalent to 220,000 yuan per market stone), causing rice merchants in various places to directly transport exports to the north, affecting the rice reserves in Wuxi. It is now known that its northern transportation ports are located at the junction of Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Changshu, Nantong, and other counties. The Provincial Government has urgently telegraphed Zhenjiang and other counties to pay close attention and sent personnel to patrol the river crossings to stop it. Also, Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed various county mayors again on the 23rd, instructing: (1) Local rice reserves must be cleared as much as possible to replenish rice sources. (2) The circulation of food within the province and transportation to Nanjing and Shanghai should be absolutely free and unobstructed. The purchase by food merchants should be effectively assisted and facilitated.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] Wang, in order to stabilize food prices, returned to Zhenjiang from Nanjing on the 23rd and personally discussed with He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Field and Grain Department: (1) Telemgraph the Ministry of Food, asking them not to purchase grain in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places along the line.

<p>[This newspaper, Wuxi, Twenty-third] The rice market here did not open this morning due to reports of soaring prices in Shanghai. The selling price of merchants in the afternoon was 330,000 per stone, which is 20,000 higher than yesterday.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, Twenty-third] Suzhou's rice market is deteriorating due to reports of soaring prices in Shanghai and Wuxi.

The rain made people feel even more uneasy. Suzhou County Mayor Shen Chenglong ordered the section chief of the Field and Grain Department to sit in the grain market every day to supervise transactions and investigate the black market.</p>
<h3>Food Prices in Beiping Continue to Rise</h3>

<h3>Japanese Zaibatsu Industries Prioritized for Reparations; Far Eastern Commission Stipulates Procedures for Dismantling and Removing Factories</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, Twenty-second] The Far Eastern Commission decided today to prioritize the industries of the Japanese Zaibatsu in the first of one thousand factories to be allocated for reparations. According to reliable sources, the Far Eastern Commission has stipulated the order in which these one thousand factories should be handed over to the Allied countries. The first to be dismantled and shipped are factories owned by the Zaibatsu, followed by factories owned by ordinary or private individuals; next are some factories owned by people from neutral countries, and the Japanese government will compensate the original owners for these neutral countries' properties; finally, some Allied countries' properties will be moved, and the Japanese government will also compensate the original owners. These procedures have been instructed to be executed by MacArthur.</p>
<h3>Japanese Concerned About Four-Power Joint Control</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding China's proposal that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China jointly administer Japan for thirty years after the signing of a peace treaty, Japanese sources here and some officials at MacArthur's headquarters appear greatly alarmed. While the official side has not expressed an opinion, the Japanese are quite concerned. The United States' desire to include domestic foreign assets in reparations, which China opposes, is also causing unease among the Japanese. The Soviet Union's insistence on treating Japanese assets in the Northeast as war spoils has also diminished the recent hope among the Japanese that the reparations issue might gradually be resolved. Most of Japan's key industrial assets are in China and the Northeast. If these assets are excluded and then distributed, Japan will be unable to meet its reparations obligations. The Japanese government anticipates that after the peace treaty is concluded, Japan will be subject to some form of international joint control.</p>
<h3>Ms. Yang Yunzhu Arrives in America and Speaks</h3>
<p>[United Press Los Angeles, 22nd] Yang Yunzhu, advisor to the Chinese delegation to the Far Eastern Commission, arrived here today en route to Washington. According to her, Japan's full trade rights should await the restoration of national sovereignty. MacArthur's proposal to restore Japanese trade is interpreted by some as being done before the peace treaty is drafted, but in the case of Germany, no such proposal was made. For the sake of economic efficiency, the Japanese people still need to improve their rationing system. The success of the occupation policy seems to be generally recognized.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report, Continued from Yesterday's First Edition, Finances and Economy</h3>
<p>The current financial and economic situation in China can be described as very serious. Although we can call ourselves an agricultural country, even before the war, China was not a self-sufficient country in terms of food and clothing. Rice, wheat, and cotton all required some degree of imports. As a result of the eight-year war against Japan, our losses, according to preliminary estimates by the Reparations Commission of this Yuan, amount to approximately US$33.1 billion in direct losses, US$20.4 billion in indirect losses, and US$4.1 billion in war expenses. The losses in the northeastern provinces and the areas occupied by the Communists have not yet been estimated. After the war ended, due to domestic division and unrest, domestic production continued to shrink, prices continued to rise, transportation was disrupted everywhere, and people's lives were difficult. This desolate economy naturally reflected on the finances. The total national revenue and expenditure budget for this year has already been submitted to the Resident Committee of your esteemed assembly for preliminary review. The original expenditure budget was over 930 billion, but due to the continued rise in prices, the average monthly overspending by the end of April this year was 900 billion yuan. Based on this figure, it is possible that it will reach 20 trillion by the end of this year. On the revenue side, the income is listed at over 730 billion yuan. Even if the tariff revenue increases due to foreign exchange rate adjustments, it may increase to 10 trillion yuan according to current estimates. Adding the US dollar bonds and US dollar treasury bills issued this year, totaling 400 million (approximately 4.8 trillion in legal currency), it is still a large deficit compared to the expenditure. It relies on the handling of state-owned enterprises and surplus goods to make up for it. If prices rise further, the deficit will increase even more. The current financial and economic illnesses can be said to be mutually causative. It is really difficult to increase revenue, reduce expenditure, and balance the budget. However, under these circumstances, no matter what, the government's approach to finance is to try to increase revenue as much as possible on the one hand, and to save expenditure as much as possible on the other. All the money that can be saved is saved as much as possible, and all non-urgent and non-fundamental construction projects are eliminated as much as possible, using all our strength and determination to gradually balance the budget. In the emergency economic measures announced at the beginning of February this year, the first method proposed was to balance the budget, which shows its importance. Because economic stability, social stability, political progress, and construction can only be carried out by starting with a balanced budget. If it cannot be achieved immediately, we should also strive to reduce the difference between income and expenditure in the budget. Only in this way can we control the issuance of currency, stabilize the currency value, and lay the foundation for the fundamental reorganization of the currency system. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Our Country's Attitude Towards the Japanese Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang, in his foreign policy report to the National Political Council, reiterated our country's basic attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue. He stated: "Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, we should seek a solution based on the demands of justice and fairness. The standard of living allowed to the Japanese people in the future by the Allied nations should also be determined in accordance with this principle. China has resisted for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses. According to any fair standard, China should receive the largest proportion of the total Japanese reparations." At the same time, Foreign Minister Wang also expressed the hope that this reparations issue can be resolved reasonably and fairly as soon as possible. In fact, at present, countries such as Britain and the United States all hope to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When the British House of Commons discussed the current foreign policy on the 16th, Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed particular concern about Britain's interests in the Far East, and said that Britain hopes to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, and Australia and Canada are particularly concerned about this. As for the United States, Secretary of State Marshall considered how to draft the peace treaty with Japan after returning from Moscow. Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces MacArthur has also repeatedly called for accelerating the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. However, among this series of Japanese issues, the most important link is the Japanese reparations issue, which is the core of the peace treaty with Japan. Without resolving this issue, the peace treaty will not be easy to draft successfully. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall convened the Far Eastern Commission on May 5 to listen to the opinions of the representatives of eleven countries to determine the percentage of distribution of Japanese reparations, so as to achieve a partial solution to this complex issue. However, the Australian representative insisted that the reparations issue should be resolved by the peace conference with Japan, so the Far Eastern Commission adjourned without results. Later, the Soviet Union also stated its position, advocating that reparations should be extracted from Japan's current production, making the stalemate on the reparations issue even more difficult to break.</p>
<p>However, the US State Department is still trying its best to break the deadlock on the Allied nations' demands for reparations from Japan. Therefore, after the Far Eastern Commission adjourned without results, it continued to meet in the past week and has reached agreement on three points: (1) All Japanese liquid assets should be used first to pay for US occupation expenses and relief expenses; (2) The removal of reparations materials should not hinder the minimum standard of living for the Japanese people based on 1934; (3) The proportion of reparations demanded by each country should be based on the standard of its actual losses and its contributions, and this should be used as the basis for future discussions. Can this effort by the United States break the deadlock? At least for now, it is still a serious question. Even the representatives of various countries attending the meeting are not too optimistic and unanimously believe that it will take several months to reach an agreement. However, the repeated delays and unresolved resolution of this issue will affect China the most. Today's China not only hopes that the Far East will achieve lasting peace as soon as possible, but also urgently needs to obtain reparations materials from Japan. Therefore, we cannot ignore this issue.</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of the percentage of Allied nations' distribution of Japanese reparations, our government has already issued a statement: "Our country has resisted for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses. China should enjoy a preferential ratio and priority of compensation for Japan's reparations to the Allied nations." This statement can be described as justified and forceful, so that the Allied nations cannot but express their approval. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the total loss of public and private materials was no less than US$300 billion, not including the deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians and the expenditure of national military expenses. Now, after our country has suffered great trauma and is engaged in post-war reconstruction, whether in terms of materials or economics, we need foreign assistance. It is reasonable to demand priority compensation and a preferential ratio from Japan. Wu Bannong, head of our reparations group stationed in Japan, stated in Osaka on May 10: "China hopes to extract reparations from Japan's current production. China needs to obtain materials that can be used immediately from Japan. China also hopes to obtain all daily necessities immediately as part of the reparations China should receive, such as cloth, locomotive heads, steel rails, and other materials that Japanese factories can produce." This passage can represent the true attitude of the Chinese government. However, our representative stationed in Japan has always been in a passive position, and the opinions of our delegation have not been valued by all parties. Therefore, we have to request the government to negotiate with MacArthur's headquarters, especially for the following two things, we must argue with reason: (1) Japan requested MacArthur's headquarters to reduce the number of reparations that would first be allocated to China, the Philippines, and other countries; (2) It is heard that the new US plan stipulates the ratio of each country, with the United States accounting for 31%, China accounting for 27%, and other countries totaling 39%.</p>
<p>The second issue is that the United States and the Soviet Union have completely different opinions on the Japanese reparations issue. Our country should adopt a detached attitude. No matter what the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are, our attitude should always be based on our own interests. For example, the Soviet Union moved all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, with a total value of more than US$20 billion. In the Soviet Union's view, this is the Soviet Union's "war spoils" and cannot be regarded as Japanese reparations. It opposes deducting it from the reparations it should receive. The United States insists that the industrial equipment in the Northeast is Japanese assets and can be used for reparations, and should be deducted from the reparations that the Soviet Union should receive. Our country has already expressed a clear attitude towards this issue. When the Soviet Union moved the industrial equipment in the Northeast, a patriotic movement to protect rights occurred in our country, protesting against the Soviet Union's actions. In the future, when discussing this issue, our country should still maintain its original position. For example, on the issue of extracting reparations from Japan's current production, in order to reduce its occupation burden, the United States not only opposes extracting reparations from Japan's current production, but also advocates raising Japan's industrial production level from 1928 to the 1934 standard. The Soviet Union firmly opposes the US proposal and has repeatedly accused the US authorities of condoning Japan economically, and that the defeated country will soon become a prosperous paradise. Regarding this issue, on the one hand, our country urgently needs Japanese reparations and naturally supports extracting reparations from Japan's current production. At the same time, our country will never allow Japan to maintain a high level of industrial development, so that our country will still be economically oppressed by Japan. We believe that President Truman's reparations commissioner Pauley's proposal to restore Japan's industrial production level to the 1928 standard is the most reasonable. For the sake of our country's security and the lasting peace of the Far East, our delegation must argue with reason and not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>In short, the issue of Japanese reparations is not only the core of the peace treaty with Japan, but also the security of the Far East and is closely related to our country. Our delegation should broaden its horizons and, on the one hand, argue with reason, so that all countries respect our country's demands for reparations, so that our country's due interests are not subject to any major losses. On the other hand, it should also use its skills to harmonize the opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union, so that this issue can be resolved reasonably and fairly as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>With the Unanimous Support of the Four Major Parties, Tetsu Katayama Elected Prime Minister; New Cabinet Lineup Expected to Be Decided Next Week</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 7:00 PM on the 23rd to elect the prime minister by roll call. As a result, Tetsu Katayama received 420 votes out of 426 and was elected as the first Japanese prime minister after the new constitution. The Senate then convened at 7:37 PM to elect the prime minister. The voting result was that Katayama received 205 votes out of 207 and was elected. The meeting adjourned at 8:05 PM. Katayama, who is now 59 years old and a native of Wakayama, graduated from the Third High School and then entered Tokyo Imperial University. In 1891, he graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University. Afterwards, he practiced law in this county. In 1898, he went to Tokyo and set up a law firm at the YMCA. From this time on, he devoted himself to social movements. In 1900, he served as a legal advisor to the General Federation. In 1906, the Social People's Party was established, and he served as its secretary-general. Later, he served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Social Masses Party. During the war, he lived in the countryside, immersing himself in reading and writing. In November 1945, he served as the secretary-general of the Japanese Socialist Party. In September of last year, he became the chairman of the Executive Committee. After the Socialist Party obtained the status of the first party this time, the elder of the Socialist Party, Anehiko, praised Katayama as the most suitable candidate for prime minister in Japan today.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Ten minutes after being elected as the new prime minister, Tetsu Katayama issued a statement saying: "Today, I was unanimously elected as prime minister by the entire parliament, for which I am extremely grateful. In order to overcome the crisis of the Japanese nation and build a new Japan, I will do my best with utmost sincerity."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After being formally appointed as prime minister on the 24th, Tetsu Katayama will ask the presidents of various parties to cooperate in forming a cabinet, and will convene the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party at noon to determine the future cabinet formation policy. It is planned to use the prime minister's official residence as the cabinet formation headquarters. The cabinet formation work will officially begin on the 26th, and will be carried out in accordance with the established policy agreement and the joint policy of the four parties: Social, Democratic, Liberal, and National Cooperative. As for the left-wing problem raised by the Liberal Party, it will also be decided according to the party's own views. It is generally expected that the entire list of cabinet members can be decided around the 28th.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Party's Attitude is Ambiguous, and the New Cabinet is Fraught with Crises</h3>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Although the four major Japanese political parties successfully elected Katayama as prime minister, according to people here who are familiar with the political situation, there are still great difficulties ahead in forming a cabinet. Although the Liberal Party has repeatedly expressed its support for Katayama, it is difficult to expect it to cooperate with the Socialist Party in any way today, when it has let other parties take over the positions of speaker and vice-speaker and has to move towards the status of an opposition party. As for the Democratic Party, although it changed its original intention at today's four-party talks and took the lead in suggesting that the prime minister should cede to Katayama, it emphasized that it must be conditional on the formation of a four-party cabinet. Its intention is probably nothing more than to realize that the Liberal Party has no intention of forming a cabinet and to shirk the responsibility for failing to organize a four-party cabinet to the Socialist Party, and to criticize Katayama for being unable to complete the four-party united cabinet to save the country, in order to achieve its own certain attempt. Therefore, as a result, the Socialist Party will be forced to take the path of forming a cabinet with the Social National Cooperative Party. However, judging from the current political situation, it is feared that forming a cabinet by only two parties will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] US government economic experts, who had hoped that Congress and the public would accept the plan to lend and aid several countries with billions of dollars, said today that they were extremely pleased because some of the government's fiercest political opponents also attached importance to the world economic issue. They also carefully studied the ten-year foreign economic plan of Stetson, the Republican presidential candidate. Although economic experts do not agree with Wallace's fierce criticism of the Truman Doctrine, they privately admit that Wallace's continuous discussion of the world economic issue and the issue of American responsibility has been very helpful to them in gaining public support for the government's global economic plan. The number of plans to solve the world economic issue has increased in quantity in the past few days. The government economic experts believe that what is satisfactory is that although the various plans to solve the world economic issue differ in principle and detail, they all recognize that this issue does exist and that the United States should play an important role in solving it.</p>
<h3>Economic Concentration in the United States Poses a Serious Threat</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 22nd] The unprecedented phenomenon of the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few industries in the United States after the war has now aroused the vigilance of some congressmen and President Truman's economic advisors. A generation of economic advisors believes that this phenomenon is a serious threat to the American way of life and small private enterprises. President Truman had previously requested Congress in February to study new anti-trust legislation to curb its development. The conclusions of the Senate Special Committee's research on small private enterprise problems also believe that the concentration of production power in the hands of large industries is a terrible problem for the country's future.</p>
<h3>The British Cabinet's New Plan Has Been Delivered to Indian Leaders</h3>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 23rd] According to reliable sources, Nehru has received the British Cabinet's new plan to hand over power to India, which predicts that if Indian leaders cannot accept the British Cabinet's original plan, three committees should be organized to divide the boundaries, allocate national assets, and handle the national defense army. It is reported that the plan has also been submitted to the Allied leader Jinnah and Defense Minister Singh. According to well-informed sources, the National Congress Party has expressed its willingness to accept the British Cabinet's recommendations, while Jinnah is unwilling to accept them under any circumstances.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 22nd] Related parties expect the development of the Indian issue to follow the following four stages: (1) Indian leaders decide on unification or division; (2) Assuming that a decision is made to divide, the Indian Governor-General will convene Indian leaders to propose a plan under the division that satisfies all major ethnic groups. The Indian Governor-General may suggest convening a constitutional conference of the Allied nations to obtain the democratic expression of the representatives of the Muslims; (3) Assuming that the leaders agree with this suggestion, the opinions of the representatives of all ethnic groups in India can be obtained in a short period of time. Britain expects this period to be no more than two or three months; (4) Convene a meeting of the highest leaders of India to give final approval to the Indian plan based on the response of the two major constitutional conferences.</p>

Earlier, it was telegraphed that the right-wing leader of Korea, Lee Seung-man, had announced that he had concluded a secret agreement with the United States to build an independent government in the US military occupied area of ​​South Korea, so the State Department made this statement. According to newsman White, the United States has not concluded any secret agreement with anyone on the future government of Korea.</p>
<h3>Partially Open News During U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Meetings; The Soviet Side Has Made Some Concessions in This Regard</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission advocated for open meetings to allow global press coverage. Today, they achieved a partial victory. Chief U.S. Representative Brown, after today's meeting, hosted the press for the first time. He reported that the committee had allowed him to informally brief the press on non-confidential matters. The committee decided that reporters would not be allowed to attend any meetings, unless both sides agreed to designate a specific meeting for public access. Subcommittee meetings were also closed to the press. The Soviet side had proposed that all meetings be open to journalists, but considering the experience of last year's seven weeks of meetings, which resulted in only seven communiqués, today's decision can be considered a concession from the Soviet side. It is reported that the committee will issue a joint communiqué tomorrow, reporting on the initial two meetings, and will assign personnel to form three subcommittees: (1) to study matters related to consultations with Korean political parties and social organizations; (2) to handle matters related to the structure of the interim government and the preparation of a constitutional platform; and (3) to handle the method of obtaining personnel for the interim government, and the plan for the interim government to take over the duties of the existing governments in North and South Korea. The committee will reconvene at the call of Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov, who will chair the next meeting according to the procedure predetermined by the delegations of both countries.</p>
<h3>First Meeting Progresses Well</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 22nd] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission recently began meetings here to discuss the Korean issue. The meetings are being held in absolute secrecy. Today's meeting lasted for three hours. Afterwards, Major General Brown, head of the U.S. delegation, only stated that the Joint Commission had discussed procedural issues and had made great progress. According to well-informed sources, today's discussion focused on the issue of newspaper publicity, and a decision will be made on this matter tomorrow. The agenda was also discussed, one of the most important items being the issue of hearing opinions from various Korean political parties. It is reported that both U.S. and Soviet representatives agreed to grant consultative rights to all Korean political parties, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, even those parties that refuse to accept the trusteeship plan drafted at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, Korean political parties must provide a promise not to hold demonstrations or give speeches against the trusteeship plan during the Joint Commission's meetings. Extreme left-wing parties and the Democratic Party, and even some conservative party leaders, have already provided such promises, but extreme right-wing leaders have refused to provide promises, and their attitude remains very tough. The two main figures are Kim Koo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Independence Party, and Syngman Rhee, Chairman of the Independent Korean Labor Federation. Both are sixty years old and veterans of the resistance against Japanese rule. Kim Koo replaced Syngman Rhee as Chairman of the Korean government-in-exile in Chongqing in 1943. After returning to Korea, Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee both actively participated in the movement against the trusteeship plan. Their position is that whether to accept trusteeship depends on whether the U.S. and Soviet sides can reach an agreement on General Hodge's definition of trusteeship, that is, trusteeship is meant for assistance and not foreign interference. The total electricity bill is US$5 million.</p>
<h3>North Korean Power Plant Bill; Soviet Union Has Delivered It to the U.S. Side</h3>
<p>The total electricity bill is US$5 million.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] A reliable source acknowledged to United Press today that the Soviet Union has sent a bill to the U.S. side for the electricity supplied by power plants in the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea to the south. The total electricity bill is US$5 million. However, this information has not been officially confirmed here. Most of the large power plants in Korea are located in the north, and they supply a significant amount of electricity to the south through power lines. There have been several power outages, but there is no indication that the Soviet side deliberately cut off the electricity. It is said that the power outages were due to the lack of experience of the electrical workers. It is also reported that the U.S. Army has inquired with U.S. civilian contractors about whether they are interested in building power plants in southern Korea, but the contractors have shown little interest. According to unverified reports, the U.S. occupation forces are considering installing mobile generators near the residential areas of U.S. military personnel and their families, in case of power outages.</p>
<h3>Truman to Submit to Congress Soon; Western Hemisphere Arms Standardization Plan; Brighton May Submit Resignation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Well-informed sources here recently stated that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, following the recommendation of a special committee organized by the Army, Navy, and State Department, have decided to submit a plan to Congress in the near future, advocating for the standardization of armaments in the Western Hemisphere and the training of senior military officers from South American countries in the United States. Following this important change in U.S. foreign policy, Brighton, Assistant Secretary of State for South American Affairs, may resign. Brighton has opposed this plan for some time, believing that it will cause the United States to lose credibility in South America. However, Marshall does not agree with Brighton's views. Marshall has promised the special committee organized by the Army, Navy, and State Department that he will prove to the Senate that this plan is in line with the principles of regional armament and that it will be easy to pass. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, has also promised to do his best to get the Senate Republicans to vote in favor of this "Truman Plan." General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff of the Army, also believes that the United States' implementation of this plan is sufficient to curb the arms race in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Soviet official newspaper "Izvestia" stated today that the amendments proposed by the British side during the recent negotiations on amending the Anglo-Soviet Treaty were sufficient to weaken the obligations contained in the original treaty. A British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement in response, stating that British policy is not intended to weaken the obligations stipulated in the original treaty, and that negotiations have been initiated in Moscow to strengthen the treaty and make it suitable for the current environment. For example, the British proposal to extend the validity of the treaty from twenty years to fifty years can indicate Britain's desire to consolidate long-term understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain's aim, as Foreign Secretary Bevin said, is to harmonize the amended Anglo-Soviet Treaty with the obligations of both countries to the United Nations organization, as well as Britain's obligations to other allies to safeguard security and prevent Germany from re-aggressing.</p>

<h3>Internal Disputes in Various Schools Intensify; Fights Occur at Fudan and Shanghai Law College; Fudan Student Yan Chongze and Others Seriously Injured; Mayor Guarantees Safety of Students Attending Classes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Fudan University students attended classes as usual yesterday morning, but unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM, many students from outside the school came to the school to incite a strike, attempting to expand the student movement. This was opposed by the majority of students attending classes, leading to a conflict. Fudan student Yan Chongze was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for emergency treatment. Other students, including Li Maoqun, Su Changgeng, and Hou Zhenyu, sustained minor injuries. The Xinshi Street Police Precinct, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched police officers to maintain order outside the school gate. Subsequently, the Police Headquarters also dispatched two police vehicles to suppress the situation. At that time, five students who committed the violence, Zhang Hengchang, He Qingrui, Liu Yuhua, Ling Youxian, and Lü Youwei, were identified by students who opposed the strike and handed over to the precinct for detention. Other students attempting to strike remained in the classroom. The school principal, Zhang Yi, and the heads of various departments convened an administrative meeting to discuss solutions. In the evening, Mayor Wu also personally went to the school to investigate, guaranteeing the safety of students attending classes to the school principal and withdrawing the police. A resolution was reached at around 9:00 PM. As of the reporter's deadline, more than one hundred students remained in the classroom.</p>
<p>[Another Report] More than ten groups, including the Anhui Students' Association of the school, established the "Fudan University May 23rd Bloodshed Support Association" at 9:00 PM last night. More than eighty representatives attended. It was decided to request the security authorities and the school authorities to severely punish the perpetrators and thoroughly investigate the masterminds. Also, two reporters from the Wenhui Daily were beaten when they went to the school yesterday to cover the news. They appealed to Mayor Wu, who expressed his condolences.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] As the student movement evolved yesterday, it formed a conflict between two factions of students, those advocating for resuming classes and those insisting on the strike. Internal disputes in various schools are intensifying. Yesterday, both Shanghai Law College and Fudan University saw incidents of students advocating for resuming classes being beaten. At the same time, the "May 20th Massacre Support Association," led by a small number of students from Jiaotong University, Jinda University, and other schools, dispatched propaganda teams yesterday, taking two large trucks and going to various middle schools to incite strikes. However, they were rejected by the majority of students in most schools. Therefore, although yesterday was the day of "General Strike" promoted by the "Support Association," the strike situation was not as serious as generally speculated. Some middle schools and girls' schools, fearing accidents, effectively suspended classes in the afternoon, and students left school to return home. Universities that completely went on strike yesterday included Jiaotong University, Jinda University, Tongji University, Shanghai University, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Datong University, Shanghai Art College, and China Vocational School of Industry and Commerce. Middle schools that went on strike or suspended classes included Pudong High School, Zhaoguang High School, Jiancheng High School, Chouneng High School, Huafa High School, Datong High School Affiliated, Meilun High School, Fudan High School, Shizhong High School, Jiaotong High School Affiliated, Chongde Girls' High School, Yangzheng High School, Tongji High School Affiliated, Jinyuan High School, Fudan High School Affiliated, and others. Partially suspended schools included Fudan University, Shanghai Law College, Soochow University, Tongde University, and others on the university side, and Xinjian High School, Yucai High School, Nanyang Girls' High School, Renyi High School, Peiming Girls' High School, Wuxing High School, Zhirenyong Girls' High School, Qixiu High School, and Nanyang Model High School on the middle school side. All other schools attended classes as usual. The situation in various schools is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua: Guanghua University still attended classes as usual yesterday. However, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a small number of students went to the Academic Affairs Office to prevent professors from going to the classroom to teach, causing a disturbance, but it was quickly quelled. Yesterday, the number of students attending classes accounted for more than two-thirds of the total. The school also issued a notice yesterday, advising students to attend classes, and those who do not attend classes will be marked as absent.</p>
<p>School of Commerce: The Bank Association, formed by some students of Shanghai School of Commerce, launched a plenary meeting yesterday, intending to organize a "Support Association." However, most of the students in the school had already signed condolences to the students of Central University some days ago, believing that their attitude of justice had already been expressed. They all advocated that academics should be the priority and that classes should be attended as usual. Therefore, very few people attended the meeting yesterday, less than one-fifth of the total. Most of those who attended also opposed participating in the "Nanjing Massacre Support Association" organized by various universities in the city. Therefore, they only decided to send a telegram to comfort the injured students of Central University and a letter to students across the country, and continued to attend classes as usual. More than one hundred students from Jiaotong University went to the school yesterday to promote and incite strikes, but were rejected by the school. The propaganda team left disappointed.</p>
<p>Tongde: Tongde Medical College launched a strike yesterday by the third-year students, and propaganda teams from Shanghai Medical College and Jiaotong University propagandized to other grades, but did not receive a response. As a result, except for the entire third-year class being absent, the entire school attended classes as usual.</p>
<p>Soochow: Soochow University's College of Arts and Sciences decided to strike for two days starting yesterday, in response to the "Massacre Support Association." The students of the school's Law College listed three methods: (1) sending a telegram to comfort the injured students of Central University, (2) striking, and (3) petitioning, as a public opinion test. The test results determined that the first method, sending a telegram of condolence, would be adopted, so classes were still attended as usual.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Zhejiang University school authorities issued a message yesterday stating: "Since the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association was organized last month, its constitution has not complied with the student self-government association rules promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The school authorities have ordered it to be amended, but it has not been completed so far. The representatives and staff members produced by it have not officially taken office. However, the association has been exercising its powers arbitrarily for the past two weeks and is taking an equal position with the school, not listening to guidance. Recently, it has become even more serious, announcing a strike, organizing a picket team, interfering with students' freedom, and threatening teachers and staff, adding insults. Its actions are outrageous and inexplicable. The school has been forced to dissolve the association on May 21st, according to the Ministry's regulations, and ordered the students to reorganize under the guidance of the Dean of Students. Now, during the storm, the school has notified the families of the students remaining at the school to take them back separately to avoid accidents. Classes will be notified again once the storm subsides." The School of Nursing of the National Shanghai Medical College's Resumption of Classes Movement Committee, in order to maintain its studies and oppose the strike, has issued a letter to the parents of students, urging them to supervise their children to abide by school rules and resume classes immediately.</p>
<p>St. John's: The strike propaganda team also went to St. John's University yesterday to propagandize. Among the more than 1,800 students in the school, only more than 180 students signed in favor of the strike, and more than 300 students signed in favor of sympathizing and consoling without striking. Therefore, the school still attended classes as usual yesterday. Zhang Jiongbo went to lecture yesterday, but the audience was not enthusiastic. The Jiaotong University Student Self-Government Association has recently been publicizing extensively outside the school, and invited Mr. Ping Xin, a member of the China Democratic League, to give a lecture at the school last night to incite strikes. It also posted large cartoons inside and outside the school, doing everything possible to insult the government. Among them, there were ten cartoons with the words "Who is the murderer? The government!" which aroused the righteous indignation of a student named Qin, who tore them down. He was then taken away by special members of the Self-Government Association, who searched his body and interrogated him under threat, arousing the public outrage of the majority of students. For a time, the order in the school was in chaos. The military police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and the Self-Government Association ordered the school police to close the school gates. Later, the principal came forward to mediate and released Qin. It is heard that most of the anti-strike students in the school have decided to organize the "Jiaotong University Student Justice Alliance" to actively launch a struggle to protect the school and resume classes, and to uphold justice.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Council Speaker Pan visited the five districts of Changshu, Xuhui, Changning, Jiangning, and Putuo in the rain yesterday. Secretary-General Xiang and representatives from the Public Works and Health Bureaus accompanied him. Councilors and district chiefs along the way provided the following opinions on municipal administration and reform: (1) Water supply is difficult in densely populated棚戶 areas. Please install public water fountains accordingly. (2) The road surface is uneven and garbage is everywhere at Wujiaochang Guihua Road Weishou Branch Road and other places. It is hoped that the road surface and environmental sanitation will be improved. (3) As soon as Zhaojia浜 is filled,棚戶build houses. It is hoped that this can be prevented in advance to avoid difficulties in demolition later. (4) Dung trucks on Anyuan Road stop at will, which is extremely detrimental to hygiene. It is hoped that they can be moved to the dung truck terminal. (5) Manufacturers in Xujiahui suffer from the arbitrary power outages by China Merchants Electric Company, resulting in no small losses. It is hoped that this can be improved. (6) The coffin station on Anyuan Road often stores one or two hundred coffins, which often emit foul odors. It is hoped that it can be moved to a remote place to emphasize hygiene. (7) Yuyao Road (Singapore Road) is severely damaged. Manufacturers there subsidized 140 million yuan, and construction has now begun. It is hoped that it will be completed soon. At present, it is difficult to start construction work with the municipal treasury's expenditures. It is hoped that all manufacturers in this city will follow suit, and Shanghai's construction will not be difficult to advance rapidly. (8) Meichou Elementary School on Changshou Branch Road is the first school dedicated to the city. Four classes have been opened, and more than 50 million has been spent.

<h3>Embezzlement of Fines Case, Customs Police Chief's Trial Concluded and Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Fang Junde, acting police chief of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Station, was accused of embezzlement and corruption. The case was heard by Judge Meng Tingke in the District Court yesterday.

However, all the public funds were stored in a safe deposit box and there was no intention of embezzling them. Subsequently, Wei Gongshuo, Deputy Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, and Zhang Hongkui, Acting Deputy Commissioner, were summoned as witnesses for questioning. The defendant's lawyer, Zheng Lintong, then stood up to defend, stating that the customs handled the case without following normal procedures, avoided the participation of Chinese and Western officials, and did not conduct an investigation by the investigation committee, so the transfer to the court was obviously inappropriate. He then stated that the cause of the case was due to a private feud with Duan Baike, the director of the Extra Port Bureau. Finally, he said that the defendant had received higher education and had been working in the customs for 15 years, so why would he embezzle this small amount of public funds. The court concluded the trial of the case and scheduled the judgment for the 30th.</p>

<h3>Inducement in Prison Cleverly Solves Murder Case, Truth of Killing Husband and Abandoning Corpse Revealed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang De, a Chongming native residing at No. 7, Qijia, Caozhen, Jiangxin River, Gaoqiao, wife Zhang Yinzi, 22 years old, beautiful appearance, romantic nature, so that the local idlers, pursuers quite a few. He was seduced by Huang Gengqing, who lived at No. 10 Yisha, into adultery. After a long time, the scandal spread, and the husband Huang De also heard about it, but there was no evidence. It was not until July last year that he was finally caught. At that time, for the sake of face, he was unwilling to make any announcement. In addition to warning the adulterer, he only monitored his wife's actions. Huang Gengqing was deeply afraid of revenge and harbored murderous intentions. On the night of December 21 last year, he instigated Tang Quansheng and Shi Xiaoyi to lure Huang De out,</p>
<p>Hire a Boat to Cross the River</p>
<p>Lace him to death in a deserted place and bury his body in the reeds on the beach, intending to remove the thorn in his side and be able to sleep soundly from now on. For the sake of万全, he later instructed Tang to send a letter under a false name to prevent his uncle from investigating. However, the net of heaven is wide, and this case of adultery and murder of the husband was finally revealed by the current director of the Gaoqiao Police Sub-Bureau, Sun Keqiang, and criminal section chief Yuan Lunli, police chief Jiang, and officers Chen Kunwang and Ma Jun after several investigations. The reason is that Huang De</p>
<p>Since Losing His Slippers</p>
<p>His uncle had sent people out to look for him for more than a month, but there was no news. Later, he suddenly received a letter signed by Huang De, which said, "I have been introduced by a friend to work in a certain unit in Chongming, everything is fine, don't worry." After comparing it with his past handwriting, it was obvious that it was not written by him, and there was no real address in the letter, which increased his doubts. After discussing it with the chief of the town, Xi Zhiliang, he decided to report it to the Gaoqiao Police Station and request an investigation. At that time, the director of the sub-bureau, Zhou Zhijian, immediately believed that his wife and tenant Shi Xiaoyi were suspected of a major crime. However, after being summoned, there were no suspicious points, so he</p>
<p>Release on Bail</p>

Recently, he filed another petition requesting a review, hoping to find out the truth. After reviewing the files, Director Sun believed that the case was indeed suspicious. He sent section chiefs to secretly investigate. After learning that Zhang Yinzi and Huang Gengqing had an affair, he arrested the pair of adulterers and adulteresses on the 10th of this month without making a sound and deliberately imprisoned them in one room. He also ordered the worker Qin Qiusheng to disguise as a prisoner and stay with them to obtain the truth from the two. That night, Qin chatted with Huang and asked why he was arrested. Huang thought that he was also a prisoner and said bluntly that he had killed his husband because he had an affair with this woman, but if he did not confess, the police bureau could not do anything about it.</p>
<p>Showing a Proud</p>
<p>Color. Late at night, Qin pretended to fall asleep, but Huang, who was emboldened by色, still tried to commit adultery with the woman. At this point, Qin showed his identity and escorted them to the director's office. The director interrogated them personally that night. Although Huang was cunning, he could not deny it. The next morning, according to the confession, the accomplice Tang Quansheng was arrested near Longhua, and Shi Xiaogou, the boatman who crossed the river that day, was arrested in Xingang. After interrogation, the confessions were roughly the same, and the whole case was revealed. However, although the body has been excavated for many days, it has not been found. It is expected that it has been washed away by the river. Except for Shi Xiaoyi, the accomplice who is still at large, the four male and female criminals who were arrested in the case have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday.</p>

However, there may have been imperfections in our division's allocation of relief materials, and there were various reasons for this, which we hope everyone can understand. Our division's allocation of materials has always prioritized children's institutions, and the quantity allocated to children's institutions has also been the largest. This is something we can assure everyone of. After our division closes, children's welfare matters will be handled by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association. Currently, our division still has materials such as floral cloth, khaki cloth, and used clothing, which are sufficient for several years of use and will be distributed by the Promotion Association. However, we hope that all organizations can treasure these resources and utilize them fully, with children as the target. Recently, we have heard that a few institutions will close after our division closes. This action violates the purpose of relief and social welfare, and we hope that they can grit their teeth and persevere in their service to the end."</p>
<p>Unite, Launch Work</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ms. Liu reported on the organization, plans, and working principles of the Promotion Association, stating that the association's service scope is very broad and hoping that all sectors can unite to launch work together.

Regarding materials, there are currently cotton quilts, military blankets, mosquito nets, etc., which will be distributed by the association's distribution committee after reviewing applications.</p>

Reports stated that the leader of the organization was a Korean youth named Li Yiping.

Judge Cai Jing presided over the hearing. Both Wang and Li appeared in court successively. Wang Qihua first presented the grounds for divorce: (1) Married for nine years, the eight-year-old child has been taken back to Seoul by the defendant, and the defendant already had a Korean wife in Seoul. (2) The defendant wanders around all year round, does not engage in production, is violent, and often beats her.

After Mrs. Jialing passed away, we, the plaintiffs, remained silent about this will. Now, citing Article 1199 of the Civil Code, we legally file this lawsuit, requesting that it be ordered to execute the will as soon as possible, in accordance with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' announced living index for March (6,614 times), and with reference to the amount separately bequeathed to each of the plaintiffs in the will (according to the Hardoon Foreign Company and Ai Li Garden employees noted in Mrs. Jialing's will, 100,000 yuan was distributed to fifty people, with an average of 2,000 yuan per person), and to order that the defendant bear the costs of this lawsuit." This case was heard yesterday by the Civil Court of the District Court. Representatives of both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. The court ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Meets with Reporters Yesterday, Reports on the Handling of the Student Unrest, In Order to Safeguard the Safety of Four Million Citizens of Shanghai, Will Never Tolerate Conspiratorial Elements Inciting Student Unrest</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu met with reporters at the Municipal Government office at 11:00 AM yesterday to report on the Municipal Government's handling of the student unrest: (1) The night before last (the 22nd), a mutual beating occurred among students at the Shanghai Law School, caused by some students publicly inciting the "Dragon Strike" (a city-wide strike of shops and factories). Three students reported the incident to the police station, and eleven students involved in the incident were arrested on the spot and sent to the court for investigation. The "Dragon Strike" is a loss for all citizens, and such actions by a few students clearly violate the Criminal Law and the Martial Law, disrupting social order. (2) The Freshmen College of Tongji University in the city had already resumed classes voluntarily. Yesterday, more than forty outside students suddenly went to the school to incite a strike. The school authorities formally requested the Municipal Government to provide protection. The Municipal Government has ordered the Jiangwan sub-bureau in charge to provide strict protection. In the future, if such situations occur again, they will be investigated and dealt with severely. (3) At Datong University, a small number of students occupied the school buildings. The Municipal Government received a letter from the school's president, Hu Dunfu, a few days ago and sent Councilor Ge Kexin to the school to persuade them. Mayor Wu also personally visited the school the day before yesterday (the 22nd) and ordered the students to withdraw within the prescribed time, otherwise the leaders will be arrested. (4) The Student Self-Government Association of Shanghai Medical College sent me an open letter in the Wenhui Daily a few days ago, asking me to answer it. It must be known that the four measures decided and promulgated by the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters are all based on legal regulations. According to Article 52 of the Police Offences Act, the police authorities have the right to question anyone who holds a meeting without the permission of the government. The Shanghai Medical College held a meeting without notifying the police or obtaining the consent of the president of the college, which is clearly inconsistent with the Police Offences Act and should be punished by law. Finally, Mayor Wu solemnly stated that the four million citizens of Shanghai need stability. In order to safeguard the safety of the four million citizens, the Municipal Government will never allow a few conspiratorial elements to disrupt social order and public peace. Those who do not abide by the law will be punished by law and will never be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Mutual Beating Occurs at Law School, Students Who Committed the Violence Are Detained for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A small number of students from the Shanghai Law School's News Association publicly incited a strike of classes, workers and businesses at around 1:00 AM on the 23rd, which was opposed by the majority of students, leading to a mutual beating. Three students, Mao Yong, Zhou Jiaji, Zhang Yimin, and others were seriously injured. After the Sichuan Road Police Station learned of this at 2:00 AM, it dispatched police officers to detain eleven students who committed the violence for questioning. They confessed without denial. The police station then sent them to the District Attorney's Office on charges of "disrupting social order." Afterwards, the school's president, professors, and more than 200 students went to the police station to demand their release, but were unsuccessful. The list of detained students is as follows: Li Shuxi, Zheng An, Yang Hui, Tang Kefei, Yu Xiaohe, Zhou Zuji, Xia Wei, Su Shuyuan, Qu Yuan, Cao Shitang, Tian Jiyi.</p>
<h3>Outside Students' Incitement Ineffective</h3>
<p>Daxia University Continues Classes as Usual</p>

Wang Lingji, the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, specially invited party and group leaders and leaders from all walks of life yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions to the student unrest at Zhengda University.

The professors and several gentry members should go to the school after the meeting to educate the students. The Nanchang Provincial Medical College of Medicine went on strike yesterday. The Self-Government Association of Provincial Secondary Schools and above in Nanchang responded one after another. The Zhengda May 21st incident also formed an anti-violence committee, and the situation is serious, indicating that sinister parties are secretly at work. The authorities attach great importance to this matter and are strictly preventing it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] The student unrest at Zhengda University has no obvious actions today, and the graduating class is still attending classes as usual.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Chaoyang Incident, President Shi Has Not Yet Handed Over the Murderer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] After the incident on the 22nd at Chaoyang College where reactionary students beat eleven students who were returning to school, Shi Zhiquan, the president of the college, and Zeng Zhishi, the dean of academic affairs, went to Beiping Garrison Headquarters to meet with Director Li, reported the incident, and asked for instructions on how to deal with it. According to President Shi's report on the cause of the incident, the students who were enthusiastic about returning to school had already resumed classes yesterday. However, the students who opposed the return to school issued a wall poster, scolding two students who were most strongly advocating for the return to school in every possible way. When these two students tore down the wall poster, the students who were cursing had already prepared and began to beat the students who advocated for the return to school and who were well-behaved, causing eleven students to be seriously injured one after another. Dean Zeng Zhishi tried to stop them but was unsuccessful, and other students who sympathized with the beaten students were also beaten by the students who caused the incident. President Shi believes that the students who caused the incident were acting in an organized and planned manner. Also, the security authorities respected the opinion of the college authorities. After consultation with President Shi of the college, it was agreed that the school authorities would be responsible for handing over the murderers of the students who were beaten. President Shi Zhiquan signed his agreement to be responsible for investigating and identifying the students who caused the incident and beat the students by 4:00 PM on the 23rd and transferring them to the District Court for investigation according to law.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] In the Chaoyang College incident, the president signed his agreement on the night of the 22nd, allowing the handover of the students who committed the violence by 4:00 PM on the 23rd.

Director Li of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters invited the school authorities to exchange opinions this afternoon, hoping to find a solution to the current student unrest problem.</p>
<h3>The "Eating Light" Movement Deepens the Farmers' Misery, Farmers' Associations in Jiaxing and Other Three Counties Oppose It</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Jiaxing on the 23rd] The Farmers' Associations of Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and Haiyan Counties believe that the recent strikes and demonstrations by students demanding an increase in non-staple food expenses and the expansion of publicly funded student places are tantamount to killing the hen to get the egg and deepening the farmers' misery. Therefore, they jointly issued a "Letter to the Gentlemen of the University Student Self-Government Associations," asking them to consider the farmers and seek improvements for the entire country, and quoting two ancient poems: "Hoeing millet at noon, sweat drips onto the soil, who knows that the food on the plate, is all hardship," "Planting one grain of millet in spring, harvesting ten thousand grains in autumn, there is no idle land in the world, yet farmers still starve to death." Therefore, they ask them to display the noble spirit of "sympathizing with the majority," curb the behavior of "small self-interest," and stop the "eating light" movement.</p>
<h3>United Service to China Donates a Large Number of Books to Our Country, University Textbooks, the First Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai, and Supplementary Readers for Primary and Secondary Schools Are Transported to China</h3>
<p>[US News Agency Report] United Service to China announced: The first batch of 655 educational books donated by United Service to China to five university libraries has recently arrived in Shanghai. The second batch will also be shipped soon. The schools receiving these books are Furen, Zhendan, Guanghua, Daxia, and Guangzhou University. These books were all published between 1937 and 1946 and were selected by Miss Witty莱, director of the Columbia University Teachers College Library, to help the schools catch up with the important developments in education during the war, as Chinese universities were unable to purchase books from abroad during the war. The five universities receiving these books all have educational colleges. In addition, United Service to China has also transported 1,800 supplementary readers for use in primary and secondary schools. These 1,800 books were donated by the New York City Board of Education. United Service to China's plan to assist Chinese private schools is very broad, and the donation of books is only part of the plan. The association also donates scholarships to help university teachers pursue further studies or engage in research in the United States. 225 teachers have applied for this scholarship and are currently being screened by five specialized committees. These committees are all composed of outstanding leaders in various fields of education, such as natural sciences, social sciences, agriculture, engineering, education, and psychology. In order to ensure impartiality, the members of the committees have no relationship with the schools where the applicants are serving. The first batch of applicants who receive the scholarship will depart for the United States this summer, and the second batch is scheduled to set sail next spring.</p>

<h3>Students of St. John's University, with a Democratic Style, Stand Independently and Are Not Attacked by Student Unrest</h3>
<p>[Our Special Article] Amid the surging wave of student unrest, most universities in the city have been affected to some extent, and many schools have even seen conflicts and even beatings due to differences of opinion among students. However, St. John's University has resolved the "strike of classes" dispute very democratically. The whole school is full of a free atmosphere and continues to attend classes very quietly.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a group of students held a lecture, with Ma Xulun and Li Pingxin attending to give speeches. However, it did not arouse much interest among the students. Ma Xulun spoke for three hours on "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," and the atmosphere at the venue was very calm. Many students sitting in the back were reading novels. When Li Pingxin brought up the topic of the student unrest in Nanjing and the anti-civil war, he was met with a lot of "boo" sounds.</p>
<p>Later, a Jiaotong University student came to the stage to give a speech, inviting St. John's to participate in the "General Strike," and the "May 20th Incident Support Association" was immediately formed, with a total of 180 students participating. However, a "School Protection Association" was also established. With the support of 300 students, the "School Protection Association" decided to oppose the strike of classes, but agreed to launch a donation to comfort the injured students in Nanjing. They democratically sought opinions from all 1,800 students in the school, posting slogans to express different positions and actions. The "School Protection Association" humorously posted an announcement at the gate: "We urge Mr. Ma Xulun and Mr. Li Pingxin not to come to the school to promote a strike of classes. We want to study with peace of mind." In order to win over the masses, the "May 20th Support Association" promoted: "Strike of classes for two days, drag it out for a few days, and credits can be easily obtained." The "School Protection Association" retorted: "We are here to continue studying, not to steal credits. Look at Shanghai University and Jiaotong University, the strike of classes has no end in sight, and credits are even more elusive."</p>
<p>Promotion is promotion, and opinions can be different, but actions depend on the students. Most students are unwilling to strike of classes, so they are still very quietly continuing to attend classes.</p>
<h3>Tonight, the Expeditionary Force Faces a Formidable Enemy; The Zheng Lun Team Confronts the Giants; From 7 PM at the City Gymnasium; Mayor's Cup Youth Group Finals Before the Match</h3>
<p>The Zheng Lun basketball team's arrival in Shanghai has resulted in five wins out of five games. Starting at 7 PM today, they will face the formidable "Giants" team from the city's Western community at the City Gymnasium's fitness room for their sixth expedition match. Prior to this, the Mayor's Cup youth group finals, featuring the Sino-French team against the Green Elite team, will be held. Since the beginning of the Mayor's Cup youth group competition, the Youth Group One champion has been determined to be the Sino-French team, while the Youth Group Two champion is the Elite team. The two group champions will compete for the overall championship in a best-of-three series. The first match will begin today at 6 PM, with the second match scheduled for 6 PM on the 30th, before the Zheng Lun versus Hua Lian match. The originally scheduled League matches for Group B and the Industry and Commerce Group have been postponed. Tickets are priced at 5,000 yuan upstairs and 8,000 yuan downstairs, and will be sold starting at 5 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 5:30 PM. In addition to military police maintaining order, members of the "Four Virtues Volunteer Corps" will also be assisting. The referees will be Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng.</p>
<p>Determination to Defeat the Enemy</p>
<p>This is the Zheng Lun team's second visit to Shanghai. They have previously defeated teams such as Chen You, Ren Yu, Shan, and John. The night before last, they defeated the foreign team "Enkas" with a score of 49 to 40. Facing the "Giants" today, they are carefully considering their lineup in order to maintain their winning streak. Yesterday, the team's manager, Mr. Wu, told reporters that although the team captain, Cai Zhongqiang, suffered a serious eye injury and bled heavily during the match against "Enkas" the night before last, the swelling has subsided after careful treatment by the military doctor. However, his spirit has not yet fully recovered. Nevertheless, he is determined to lead the team in this crucial match against the "Giants." The "Sharpshooter" Tu Wenlong, as well as Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan, and others are all determined to do their best to compete with the "Giants."</p>
<p>Tonight's Key</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Kaiji Miluofu, the "Giants" have many talented players. Funik is tall and strong, Tao Bolinki is short and skillful, and the tall Gu Fo is the most dangerous player. There will undoubtedly be a tense performance. According to insiders, the most noteworthy aspect of Zheng Lun's match against the Giants tonight will be the duel between Tu Wenlong and Gu Fo. Whether Zheng Lun can win depends on Tu Wenlong's ability to score, as well as their ability to monitor Gu Fo and control the rebounds. The matches between Cai Zhongqiang and Tao Bolinki, and Yu Ruizhang and Yerong, will also be evenly matched. Today's lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>[Sino-French] Fei Jiansheng, Cao, Hu Zhengkang, Li Xusen, Wang Muping, Zhang Peilin, Zhu Guan Hong, Gong Hehua.</p>

<h3>Control Measures for Transporting Gauze to Hankou – Textile Control Committee Petitions for Cancellation – Procedures for Transporting Gauze to Various Ports in Hebei and Northeast Similar to Control Measures in South China</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The 35th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. The meeting was attended by Wu, the concurrent chairman, Li, the vice-chairman, and committee members Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and the head of the committee's business division, Liu Wenteng. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. The three important resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District and the Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association listed reasons for requesting the cancellation of the control measures for transporting gauze to Hankou. Resolution: Passed a petition to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the cancellation.</p>
<p>(2) The Textile Control Committee regularly inspects cotton yarn from various factories each month. Some yarn factories often request a re-inspection. Resolution: Cannot be accepted, but the inspection method can be improved. The original inspection method used 20 cones of yarn. It has now been decided to increase this to 40 cones, so that the yarn samples taken are more representative.</p>
<p>(3) Discussed the draft charter for the Organization Committee for the Management of Cotton Production Promotion and Textile Industry Development Funds. Resolution: Amended and passed, to be implemented after approval by the ministry.</p>
<p>[Another report] The committee had previously suspended the review of applications from manufacturers for the transport of gauze to various ports in Hebei and Northeast because various parties had repeatedly requested revisions to the control measures. Now that the 35th regular meeting has passed a petition to cancel the control measures for Hankou, the review of applications for Hebei and Northeast ports will begin immediately, and the procedures will be the same as the control measures for gauze verification in South China. It is also estimated that the second quarter (May to July) quota for foreign cotton is currently set at US$20 million, equivalent to 100,000 bales of foreign cotton. However, the actual demand for foreign cotton by yarn factories nationwide in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 520,000 bales, so there is a significant shortage. Furthermore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has already allocated 60,000 bales of foreign cotton, with half allocated to national private yarn factories. At the time of allocation (early April), the market price of cotton was approximately 800,000 yuan, so the price was set at 750,000 yuan per dan. Now that the market price of cotton has reached 1.7 million yuan, the price adjustment will be considered for future cotton allocation.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Remain Weak; Foreign Stocks Steady</h3>
<p>Government bonds were weak yesterday but stabilized later in the day. Only Unified Ding bonds fell significantly. Room 552 and Room 503 took deliveries, while Room 360 and Room 420 were sellers. Unified Bing bonds opened at 13,800 yuan, fell from 14,100 yuan to a low of 13,000 yuan, and finally struggled around the opening price. As a result, Unified Jia, Yi, Bing, and Wu bonds all fell slightly compared to the previous close, while Unified Ding bonds fell by 800 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks opened lower yesterday. After Guang Bang's intention to sell foreign currency to Bang ceased, securities brokers also exited and then moved forward rapidly, eventually recovering. Shen Dian's quoted price was mediocre, and the market situation was still not very volatile. Yi Yarn opened at 65,500 yuan, which was a low price. The high price reached 71,000 yuan, and then stabilized. As a result, English League Airlines, Steel, and Shipping all rose slightly more than half a percent compared to the previous close. Hui Dejian Telephone was flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Parallel Line Checks Stimulate Confidence – Chinese Stocks Stop Falling and Rise Again – The Battle Between Bulls and Bears Has Subsided; Small Investors are Helpless</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks saw greatly reduced interest from all parties yesterday. Trading inside and outside the exchange was quiet, and fluctuations were unusually erratic. Guang Bang sold some, but yarn factories still had an appetite for buying. In addition, there was a rumor that parallel line checks had already entered the market, making it easier to recover after a decline. The situation for miscellaneous stocks remained depressed. The new shares of Sino-French Pharmacy had just debuted the day before yesterday. A large number of shares were sold at high prices, and yesterday, it even hit the limit down.</p>
<p>The opening situation in the morning was sparse and rather weak. After Di Yong Yarn opened at 7,000 yuan, numbers 157, 218, 76, and 223 were all sold, falling to a low price of 6,880 yuan. Numbers 232, 36, 89, 91, 106, 224, and 237 all advanced, rising to 7,280 yuan. Sino-French first hit the limit down. Numbers 157, 142, 22, and 97 were sold off, falling to 7,150 yuan. Numbers 117, 148, 142, 104, and 35 advanced to 7,300 yuan. Numbers 85, 60, 32, and 36 were still being liquidated, and once fell below 7,050 yuan. The quoted price outside the exchange was high, and numbers 65, 224, 112, 16, 160, 235, 231, and 237 were successively bought, and the market rose and fell. There was a rumor that parallel line checks were entering the market, recovering to 7,480 yuan. There was news that the bulls and bears had already joined forces, and numbers 226, 224, 85, 89, 196, 143, 160, and 188 advanced to 7,730 yuan. Numbers 85, 219, 218, 165, 89, 152, and 155 were sold at below 7,450 yuan. Number 143 and others continued to advance, and Yong Yarn spot goods still hit the limit up, closing at around 7,650 yuan. As a result, Yong Yarn hit the limit up compared to the previous close. Xin He, Meiya, Xin Guang, and Jing Fu all rose slightly more than half a percent, Xinhua rose by 10%, Qin Xing rose slightly, Yong Gong was uniquely flat, and Sino-French fell by the limit down, affecting the Chinese goods listed on the same day, dropping a little more than half a percent. Datong Matches rose slightly, Zhong Si was flat, Cement fell by half a percent, and Li An fell by slightly less than 10%. The rest of the stocks rose by half a percent each. Di Jiao calculated that Yong Yarn, Xin He, Meiya, Yong Gong, and Jing Fu all rose by half a percent, Xin Guang rose slightly, and Qin Xing fell slightly. Outside the exchange, the old stocks of the world were flat, Wuzhou Dasheng rose slightly, and the rest were flat or weak.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market opened relatively stable, but later, due to the decline in cloth prices, holders sold their spot goods, and the supply was abundant, causing prices to fall. The final price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 1.2 million yuan, a slight decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count and 16-count yarns all fell by small amounts, ranging from 50,000 to 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company sold cotton yarn as usual yesterday. Prices remained unchanged. A total of 826 pieces were sold, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 368 applications.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Initially Weak, Then Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was weak because the industry believed that credit was still tight, sales were not lively, buyers were hesitant to enter, and many dyeing factories were even selling white cotton cloth. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 296,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. B-character Five Blessings fine cloth, supplied by the Textile Construction Company, was sold for 68,000 yuan below cost. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal drill fell to 289,000 yuan. By the afternoon, due to the favorable news of coupon trading, the market rebounded. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 298,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five Blessings was 285,000 yuan, also an increase of 6,000 yuan. The remaining color ball, blue crane, and Zhenzhong fine cloths all rose by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen drill recovered by 5,000 yuan. Twill gray cloth and gray tribute satin also increased by 4,000 to 10,000 yuan. However, bleached cloth and Shilin cloth showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Cocoon Collection Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Silkworm Cocoon Sales Coordination Committee is scheduled to be held at 10 AM today at the China Silkworm Company on Laobazi Road. At that time, the cocoon collection situation will be reviewed based on reports from various parties, and discussions will also be held on accelerating the promotion of loan disbursement.</p>
<p>It is also learned that to date, the number of manufacturers approved by the coordination committee and who have signed loan contracts with the Bank of China Farmers Bank has reached 52. Among the two banks that disburse loans from the China Agricultural Bank, Jiangsu accounts for 20 and Zhejiang accounts for 16. The loans that have been remitted by the China Agricultural Bank to date have exceeded 30 billion yuan. It is reported that after this year's price of fresh cocoons was set at 1 million yuan per dan, the average profit for silkworm farmers is estimated to be 300,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, after this year's spring and two loans are expanded to 200 billion yuan, the amount of direct benefits to silkworm farmers is expected to reach 60 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes: More Declines Than Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw mainly small, retail transactions. Out-of-town peers dumped a considerable amount of Hardeman cigarettes, while the dumping of Great Britain cigarettes was firmer. The noon close was still 20,000 higher than the previous day, but in the afternoon, due to tight funds within the industry, weak buying sentiment, and supply sales, the market declined again. The result was 7.15 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife was 6.6 million yuan, also a decrease of 75,000 yuan. The prices of other Chinese brands such as Beauty Golden Mouse Bank Brandy all declined uniformly. However, the prices of several brands of 10-count Five Flowers Double Axe and 20-count Goods Golden Dragon Kress Crusader rose slightly.</p>
<p>[Another report] Yesterday, the price of San Wu brand cigarettes fell again as foreign ships continued to arrive, bringing a large number of goods to the market. The price fell from 44,000 yuan to 42,500 yuan. The cigarette flavoring market was generally calm, with little price fluctuation. However, because foreign companies slightly sold off "Triangular Glycerin," the price fell slightly from 1.35 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned from laborious to weak. The association judged the price of first-grade sand to be 400,560 yuan, a primary decrease of 10,000 yuan, rebounded midway to 410,000 yuan, then 400,780 yuan, and still fell by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Two-Zero medium sand white small 10,000+ yuan, 370,000 yuan. Shantou Green, De Green, and Ji Diaocing were all originally priced, with little transaction. Xinghua white was 385,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan. Xing red was 285,000 yuan to 280,000 yuan. Only dozens of baskets were traded. Fujian sliced ice opened at 580,000 yuan, and yellow common Jian ice was 520,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Soars Madly: White粳 Rice Sets New Record High Price, Jumping to 385,000 Yuan per Shi</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the rice market soared madly, with white粳 rice reaching a new high price of 385,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market is volatile, as price increases are reported from producing areas, making the rising trend unstoppable once trading begins. Someone was manipulating prices in the North Market, pushing them up to 400,000 yuan in a "passing the buck" manner, and has been arrested and sent to legal authorities. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that such unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate prices, harming people's livelihoods, should be severely punished.</p>
<p>The market arrivals yesterday were relatively scarce due to the wind and rain overnight. The South Market had 3,663 shi and 7 dou, while the North Market had 2,978 shi and 5 dou. High-quality white粳 rice was priced at 365,000 yuan in the South Market and 385,000 yuan in the North Market.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rapid Rise in Rice Prices</p>
<p>Ji Ming, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: Rice prices in the producing areas rise with those in the city, and prices in the city rise again because of the high prices in the producing areas. This cycle of cause and effect, coupled with human factors such as market manipulation and price-gouging, leads to continuous increases. Although the free trading of rice has been approved, it should be limited to maintaining legal profits. Any deliberate price-gouging, manipulation, or hoarding will be severely dealt with according to the "Measures for Combating Hoarding of Essential Daily Commodities during Extraordinary Times."</p>
<p>Direct Rice Allocation to be Implemented Within the Month</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The direct sale of rice to factories and schools in the city is currently undergoing active registration, application, and review. The number of employees reported by some factories differs significantly from the number previously registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, so the procedures cannot be completed in the short term. The Education Bureau is handling matters for schools and will submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for review once all the information is collected. It is hoped that sales can begin within this month. Due to the recent surge in rice prices, there are rumors that the Ministry of Food may raise the price to 200,000 yuan per dan. However, according to Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, they have received instructions from the Ministry of Food that the price for rice allocated to schools will remain at 168,000 yuan per shi. The price for rice purchased by factories on behalf of their employees (i.e., purchased by the factory through the Social Affairs Bureau) will be 240,000 yuan per shi. However, rickshaw pullers, dockworkers, and others without fixed employers or employers who do not provide meals can purchase rice at 168,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding rice allocation for the poor, the Social Affairs Bureau has already drafted measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government's Counselor's Office for discussion. Relevant agencies are scheduled to meet at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>In other news: Yesterday, flour prices followed suit, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran also became firm, with small packages rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake supply was abundant, with a slight increase of 300 to 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans remained stable. Mung beans were moving slowly, declining by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red sorghum arrivals and sales were scarce, and the market was firm. Corn was heavily purchased from the north, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame from foreign firms showed slight movement, becoming subtly tight. Raw peanuts and red beans were in short supply. The oil market saw continuous arrivals, but the volume was very small. Soybean oil was firm, raw oil was flat, clear oil was unchanged, sesame oil was similar, and vegetable oil was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Fourth Joint Office Discusses Wheat Loans: 58 Flour Mills Request 320 Billion in Loans</h3>
<p>The new wheat season is about to begin. To facilitate early purchases and increase production, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association has requested the Fourth Joint Treasury to establish a special project to handle loans. This document has been submitted to the Fourth Joint Office, which will submit it to the Office Committee for discussion. According to the person in charge, the amount of the requested loan is quite large, totaling over 320 billion yuan. Each flour mill will be loaned enough to purchase 20 days' worth of raw wheat for production. A mill producing 500 bags of flour per day needs 300 market dan of raw wheat. Assuming the market price of new wheat is 150,000 national currency per market dan, then a mill producing 500 bags should be loaned 900 million national currency. The association has 58 member mills, so the loan amount is over 320 billion, with a term of six months and the lowest possible interest rate, secured by the mills' movable and immovable property. Furthermore, the Fourth Joint Treasury established a wheat loan silver group in June of last year to cooperate with national policy and solve the people's food problems. However, due to the lack of consensus among the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, it was suspended. This year, the association has submitted another request, and it has not yet been decided whether to re-establish the silver group or have the Bank of Communications handle it.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises, Silk Goods Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon prices rose again, mainly because of recent strong sales and low inventory levels, leading holders of goods to hoard and raise prices. 120-count Gaoshan Youguang rayon opened at 17.7 million yuan with immediate transactions, then rose again to 8 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, actual buyers were deterred by the high prices and held back, causing the asking price to gradually decrease, eventually reaching 17.8 million yuan. However, the final price was still 600,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Dongyang and Jin Sanma brands also fluctuated accordingly. 75-count semi-gloss rayon was offered at 1 million yuan higher than the previous day, but no transactions occurred. Yesterday, silk goods continued to decline. Meiya bedspreads were offered at 8.3 million yuan in the market but saw no transactions. D誠格子壁縐 opened at 30,700 yuan and then gradually declined, eventually closing at 30,200 yuan, 400 yuan lower than the expected price, which was 1,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Although the raw material for rayon goods was expensive, the selling price was not easy to increase due to sluggish transactions.</p>
<p>The factory yarn market was quiet yesterday, with no transactions at any level. Asking prices remained unchanged from the previous day. High-grade Lingdan D-grade yarn was priced at 19.5 million yuan, and C-grade yarn was priced at 19.8 million yuan. Several packages were sold, purchased by knitting factories from other cities.</p>
<h3>Rosin for Varnish Nearly Exhausted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Varnish Industry Association recently reported that its stock of the main raw material, rosin, is nearing exhaustion, and import is difficult due to control regulations. They have petitioned the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office and the Transport Control Committee for assistance. The petition states that rosin was previously supplied by Texaco, Mobil, and Asiatic Petroleum Company. When asked to continue supplying, the companies stated that they could not ship the goods without our country's permit. According to representatives from Texaco, there are still thousands of bridges of this raw material stored in customs, but they cannot be released without a permit. Therefore, the varnish industry has submitted a document requesting assistance to avoid production stoppages due to a lack of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Western Suit Linings Trendy</h3>
<p>High-end black carbon, all-wool linings are particularly trendy, with rising prices and significant shortages. Lower-grade goods are abundant in stock, and prices are mostly flat and weak. French-style linings have balanced supply and demand, with prices generally stable. Sales of soft linings continue to be low, with most brands other than Hongsheng Jinqian brand being flat or weak. Printed cotton fabrics are selling well and are in short supply, with hardening market prices. Sleeve lining silks are in greater demand than supply due to silk yarn raw material and labor costs, and the lack of weaving capacity among small factories, causing prices to remain firm. Mercerized feather yarn production is strong and sales are booming, with consistently firm asking prices on the Tea Association and Yuan Yu Xing retail prices. Satin-backed yarn is awaiting actual sales, and few offer it.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the used soap market saw a drop in asking prices due to large shipments received by merchants from other cities, tightening their cash flow and forcing them to sell in the market. Huang Xiangmao soap, 120 bars per case, initially opened at 254,000 yuan, but buyers remained hesitant, and the closing price in the afternoon was 251,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. 100-bar cases also dropped by 5,000 yuan. Prices for other brands such as Guben, Arrow, and Daoguang also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The match market was also sluggish due to slow sales and a lack of vitality. Xin Fenghuang and Nanjing Dahua three brands were down 20,000 yuan per case from the previous day, while Xin Meili, Laohu, and Meigui brands remained flat.</p>
<h3>Fir Rises Again</h3>
<p>In the lumber market, fir prices, which had risen to 3,000 yuan, had slightly retreated to 2,600 yuan. Yesterday, due to increased transportation costs, they rose again to 2,800 yuan. Foreign pine market sentiment remains flat.</p>
<h3>How to Allocate Import Quotas for Industrial Raw Materials? Importers and Exporters Express Their Opinions</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of allocating import quotas for industrial raw materials, the City Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association decided at yesterday's meeting to request the Transportation Control Committee to directly obtain the right to allocate raw material imports, intending to avoid intermediary profiteering by importers. Our reporter specifically visited Song Binglun, director and secretary-general of the Importers and Exporters Association, who stated the following:</p>
<p>(1) Since the establishment of the Transportation Control Committee, the qualification review for importers has become stricter. When the association previously processed registration applications, it stipulated that: (A) Importers must obtain a certificate from the American manufacturer recognizing the importer as its resident agent in China; (B) The importer's business scope is determined and specified based on the individual import volume in 1946. Therefore, importers who still exist after this preliminary review have a non-negligible foundation.</p>
<p>(2) Outsiders often believe that importers are only intermediaries who profit and exploit, but this view is due to a lack of understanding of international trade. The idea that factories want to directly obtain the right to allocate imported raw materials is extremely narrow-minded. Most of our country's industrial raw materials rely on foreign countries, and not every factory in one country can directly order from abroad. (A) Market conditions and prices fluctuate constantly, and importers have more timely access to information; (B) Foreign manufacturers make the same goods with different qualities, and prices often change at any time. This kind of specialized commercial experience can only be mastered by those experienced in international trade.</p>
<p>(3) International traders are not only familiar with domestic industry but also with foreign industry. Importers' business scope involves ordering various goods and is flexible at any time, with no fixed items. Their preparations for importing goods cover a wide range to meet the needs of our various industries. The difficulties faced by factories individually ordering from abroad are unspeakable.</p>
<p>In other news: The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association held its 19th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, chaired by Director Zhang Huanzhang, to discuss several proposals. Because the outside world may not fully understand the position of importers and exporters, the association sent a letter to Director Zhang of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Committee, stating the main points as follows: "It is noted that importers and exporters are regarded as tools for implementing national policy in all countries around the world, and every effort is made to protect and assist their development. The development of import and export trade also promotes the prosperity of banking, insurance, transportation, and factories. Importers and exporters must be aware of the production situation, product standards, and price levels of foreign manufacturers, and they must also have accurate surveys and statistics on the actual situation and real needs of domestic factories. Most also have agency relationships with foreign manufacturers, which gives them accurate market prices for ordering materials to meet domestic needs. Therefore, importers and exporters are commercial organizations that cherish foreign exchange and prevent its wasteful use. Why abandon the fundamentals and pursue the branches, and request that the quota allocation be handed over to the autonomous management of each industrial association? Furthermore, importers have been reviewed and registered by your association and are legitimate organizations. Therefore, the ability to obtain allocation quotas is granted after careful consideration by your association, knowing that your association will never lightly believe rumors and hastily approve them to fulfill their selfish desires. However, in order to maintain the economic prosperity of the country and express the position of importers and exporters, this matter was raised at the 19th joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and it was unanimously decided to telegraph your office to request your review, grant justice, and we await your orders." (Remainder omitted).</p>
<h3>High-Grade Bituminous Coal Rises</h3>
<p>The market for high-grade bituminous coal, such as Kailuan, Fuxin, and Keelung coal, is gradually rising as manufacturers become more active and traders become more enthusiastic about stocking up. The market for low-grade bituminous coal, such as Jiaocheng and Poluo coal, remains sluggish due to numerous arrivals, and prices remain low. Arrivals of white coal lumps from various locations are gradually increasing, but they are mostly of poor quality and do not meet the actual sales standards in Shanghai, so the market for high-grade goods such as Jiaozuo coal lumps remains firm. Tianjin and Yingkou are showing interest.</p>
<h3>Sian New Roasted Green Tea</h3>
<p>Tianjin and Yingkou are showing interest.</p>
<p>Since the prices of red and green tea specifically for export have been gradually tightening from overseas, it is increasingly difficult to reach a negotiation. Recently, transactions have been like dead ashes, and the market has no vitality. It is understood that tea exporters, in view of the current situation of Chinese tea exports nearing extinction, will soon convene their colleagues to actively discuss ways to save the situation in order to continue their survival. As for domestic sales, there are exchanges and changes in the process. According to industry insiders, Tianjin and Yingkou are very interested in this year's new roasted green tea from Sian. There are reports that prices are very harsh, which may prevent smooth sales for a time.</p>
<h3>Cement Industry Applies for Permission to Import Gypsum</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Cement Industry Association stated that gypsum is the main raw material for cement production, and the domestic quantity of gypsum has sharply decreased, transportation is difficult, and supply is insufficient. It has petitioned the Transportation Control Committee to approve the supply of foreign exchange to allow import. It has been learned that the Transportation Control Committee replied on the 5th of this month, saying that it would "approve the amount within the possible range."</p>

<h3>British Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Boyd Visits Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— By Chen Zhengyu, Special Correspondent in Fuzhou, 19th by Airmail</p>
<p>On the 13th, Fuzhou received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that Vice Admiral Denis Boyd, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, would arrive in Fuzhou for a visit on the 16th. People from all walks of life in Fuzhou were extremely excited upon hearing this news. It was the first time since the war that such a high-ranking guest had visited Fuzhou with goodwill and friendship!</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to the history of World War II and international developments will likely know that General Boyd was a senior commander in charge of British Air Force operations during the war. In the battles against Japan and Germany, he commanded the British Royal Naval Air Service, using surprise attack tactics to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. He had an immortal record for the British Empire during the war. He was promoted from commander of the Naval Air Service to Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, awarded the rank of Vice Admiral, and rose to become the fifth most famous figure in the British Navy. Boyd is nearly sixty years old and has served in the British Navy for forty-two years.</p>
<p>Distinguished Guest Arrives, Crowd Goes to Mawei to Welcome</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 16th, over thirty leading figures from various circles in Fuzhou, including news reporters and British residents, traveled from Nantai by two motorboats to Mawei to greet him. The Alert, the ship on which Boyd was traveling, sailed into the Minjiang River estuary at noon and anchored at Mawei. The welcoming party immediately approached and boarded the ship. Boyd, accompanied by his wife and daughter, stood respectfully on the deck to greet them and shook hands with each welcomer, a lively scene. Accompanying Boyd were also Colonel and Mrs. White, Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Dulliel, Lieutenant Colonel Gullard, Captain Gibson, and Miss Milligan. These people had all fought against the Japanese Navy in Chinese waters during the war, were very familiar with the situation in China, and had a general liking for China. After arriving in Fuzhou, Boyd and his party stayed at the residence of the customs commissioner of the Fuzhou Cangqianshan Maritime Customs and the HSBC Bank of British merchants.</p>
<p>Three-Day Stay, Visit the "Living Buddha"</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM on the 16th, Boyd and his entourage went to the provincial government to visit Chairman Liu. This event kept the officials in the government busy. If not caught off guard, it could at least be said that they were not very familiar with this occasion. A platoon of new, fully equipped military police was temporarily transferred from the military police corps to act as a guard of honor, and the provincial government band was also temporarily reorganized. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, a "Rice Petition Group" organized by students from the entire Xiehe University arrived at the provincial government to petition. Chairman Liu hurriedly sent the students away with a "full promise." Soon after, the distinguished guest arrived, and the Chairman received him in the Chairman's reception room. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the Chairman hosted a Chinese-style dinner for Boyd and his wife that evening, inviting naval veteran Sa Zhenbing, Li Shijia, and leading figures from all circles in the provincial capital to accompany them. The scene of toasts and exchanges was a rare international dinner party in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>That same afternoon, Boyd visited the Chinese naval veteran, "Living Buddha" Sa. Sa was the first Chinese student sent to Britain to study naval affairs. Boyd had always admired Admiral Sa Zhenbing and paid his respects very respectfully during this visit, greatly admiring Sa's indelible contribution to the founding of the Chinese Navy.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 17th, Chairman Liu, Mayor Yan, and the heads of various departments of the provincial government went to Mawei to return the visit and were invited to a banquet on the ship. That same afternoon, Boyd visited British residents and consular officials from various countries in Fuzhou. On the morning of the 18th, naval officers and soldiers held a football match in Lin Sen Park (formerly the racecourse). This is the sport that the British love the most. He left Fuzhou on the 19th to return to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Meeting with Reporters, Expectations for the Chinese Navy</p>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, the reporter drove to Boyd's residence on Cangqianshan, took out a business card, temporarily added an English title on the back, and asked the waiter to report it. After waiting for a while, the general came out in casual clothes, with white hair on his temples and a burly physique. He appeared calm and serious, fully demonstrating the personality of the British nation. He expressed his pleasure at the reporter's visit and immediately began a question-and-answer session. Boyd said that there were three motives for his visit to Fuzhou: (1) a friendly visit; (2) a visit to the Mawei military port; and (3) a general tour to benefit his duties. At the same time, he brought his wife and daughter on a long sea voyage. Since the end of the war, he has visited Singapore, Yokosuka, Kobe, Tokyo, Qinhuangdao, Beiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Manila, Bangkok, and other places. This was his first visit to Fuzhou, because he had a deep impression of Mawei, the birthplace of the Chinese Navy, and had long cherished the idea of visiting Fuzhou. Regarding the composition of the Pacific Fleet, Boyd also explained in detail to the reporter that it included two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, eight battleships, two destroyers, fourteen small gunboats, and various auxiliary and transport ships, forming a powerful fleet. These ships are stationed in various strategic areas of the Pacific, and Boyd himself is mostly stationed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"After the war, is the Allied nation willing to assist in the construction of the new Chinese Navy?" When asked this question, he replied very politely: "The Chinese Navy was once strong, but unfortunately suffered great losses after the war against Japan. China is a country with an extremely long coastline. Rebuilding the navy is not only necessary for China but also important for stabilizing the Far East. I hope that there will be peace in China as soon as possible so that the foundation of heavy industry can be laid and then the navy can be developed. The Allied nation is willing to provide China with possible assistance. Chinese sailors trained in England have achieved excellent results, which is enough." He also praised the position of Mawei, praising it as a naval resort, suitable for becoming an excellent Chinese military port.</p>
<p>The General was very interested in our newspaper, which has the longest history and largest scale in China. The reporter brought a copy of our newspaper, gave it to him to read, and told him about the circulation situation of our newspaper before shaking hands and saying goodbye. Before leaving, the General also told the reporter that he would soon return to Hong Kong and head south to meet with Chief of Staff Montgomery somewhere in Nanyang.</p>
<p>General's Visit Enhances Sino-British Friendship</p>
<p>China and Britain have always had a traditional and deep friendship. During the war, they were allies. A gentleman values a friend in need, and a friend in times of adversity is the most valuable. China is influenced by its profound cultural heritage and has always valued morality. During the war, when China's domestic battlefield was in crisis, it did not forget the difficulties of its British allies and sent elite troops to Burma to relieve the crisis in northern Burma. The British will not forget this. After the war, some disputes over Hong Kong and Kowloon and their borders have stained the precious friendship between China and Britain. We hope that after General Boyd's goodwill visit to various parts of South China, it can promote the friendship between China and Britain. General Boyd's visit to Fuzhou this time has excited more than 300,000 citizens of Fuzhou. Let this friendship of welcoming allies be taken back to Britain by General Boyd.</p>
<h3>Ten Days in Southern Yunnan: The Life of a "Sha Ding" (Mining Coolie)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Ji, Kunming Telegraph Dispatch, 17th</p>
<p>In Gejiu, miners account for over 90% of the population. Therefore, the rise and fall of Gejiu's tin industry can be clearly seen from population changes. Although the tin industry in Gejiu is currently in a slump, many miners are still working hard to support this dilapidated situation. According to records from Mengzi regarding the origin of the miners: "... initially, Fanglian Cave was a haven, attracting no less than tens of thousands of people from all directions. Seventy percent came from Hubei, thirty percent from Jiangxi, followed by Shaanxi and Shanxi, and then other provinces..." This shows that most miners came from provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. However, in recent years, miners from Yunnan have become the vast majority.</p>
<p>The lives of these "Sha Ding" who carry ore on their backs are unimaginable to outsiders. This reporter personally spoke with them and learned about their conditions through their facilities, understanding how they endure days without sunlight. I deeply feel that if the welfare of laborers continues to be eroded like this, our construction work will truly be a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Most "Sha Ding" Recruited</p>
<p>There has never been an accurate count of the "Sha Ding" in Gejiu mines. They are recruited in batches and quickly fall ill or die in batches. Mine owners fill their pockets with their blood and sweat, so how can they have the leisure to care about these insignificant matters? However, from a humanitarian standpoint, we should speak out on their behalf.</p>
<p>The hiring of "Sha Ding" can be divided into two types: recruitment and voluntary factory entry. However, the latter is very rare, accounting for only about 5%. Recruitment usually begins around the Winter Solstice. Recruiters receive commissions, while the "Sha Ding" are only given some settlement money. Like black slaves, their lives after entering the mine are entirely controlled by the mine owner. Although contracts are used in form, the "Sha Ding" essentially lose their freedom. There are no set working hours, and wages are not guaranteed. The "Sha Ding" never think about their future lives, let alone plan their own lives. Their fate is in the hands of the mine owners, who have almost absolute power over their lives and deaths.</p>
<p>Poverty-Stricken and Helpless</p>
<p>Assistant Manager Lu of the Tin Industry Company said: The lives of "Sha Ding" have improved a lot now. The past situation was even more unimaginable. Because private mine owners are only interested in profit, they naturally don't care about the lives and deaths of the "Sha Ding". The "Sha Ding" come to work in the mines because of economic difficulties and extreme poverty. Coupled with their lack of knowledge, their life goals and methods are very simple, so they are helpless and never complain.</p>
<p>A Dark World Inside the Caves</p>
<p>The average age of the "Sha Ding" is mostly between 21 and 40 years old, but there are also many young "Sha Ding" around 12 years old. When the reporter visited a private mine in the Huangmaoshan mining area, I personally saw a "Sha Ding" faint and fall while carrying ore out of the cave. Of course, the cave is dark and the paths are rugged and winding. Their journey in the cave is measured in steps, and the hardship is evident. Mine owners dig into the mountains to save labor and improve efficiency. The caves are dug very small, allowing people to only enter by hunching over. In areas with loose soil, there are no fir wood supports. When the "Sha Ding" enter the cave to carry ore, they rely entirely on their steps. Once inside, they have difficulty breathing. Sand falls into their eyes, mouth, and lungs. As a result, the "Sha Ding" often suffer from eye diseases and lung diseases. The sand fills the gaps in their lungs until they die silently.</p>
<p>Private mine owners are very unreasonable to the "Sha Ding". After being recruited to the mining area, they almost lose their freedom. They have no way to think about their future lives, and they spend their days with sand and mud, rarely seeing sunlight and fresh air. Those who cannot withstand the pressure try to escape, but escaping the control of the mine owners is a difficult task. If they are caught, they will suffer endless hardships and may even be forced to work in shackles, becoming prisoners who must work for the mine owners until they die. A popular folk song in the mining area goes: "Like grass growing under the ground, never seeing the sun. A carrying pole and basket pair, a rope in each hand. If the ore is not carried enough, you can't wash the ore when it rains. In spring, the days are long and the nights are short, and the crowing of the rooster makes you panic. You have to endure hunger and work as usual from early morning to late night. If you walk a little slower, the foreman will scold you loudly. The 'Sha Ding' never see the sun, eating only old mother soup. Carrying a gas lamp, with a good pole and two baskets on your shoulder. Holding a funeral stick, with sweat cloths tucked behind your ears. The supervisor watches you from behind, so there's no way to be lazy. The tunnels are narrow and difficult to walk, and you have to crawl on your hands and knees. The ore bags become heavier and heavier, and blood and sweat flow down your chest. When you reach the entrance of the trough, you can finally see the sun. You take a deep breath slowly, and cough up mud. The tunnels are like hell, and coming out is like being reborn." From this short folk song, we can imagine the difficult lives of the "Sha Ding".</p>
<p>Uniform Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<p>The clothing, food, and housing of the "Sha Ding" are all uniform. The mine owner provides each person with a blue cloth vest, a pair of socks (used to cushion their seat when resting in the cave), and a set of off-work clothes. These items are deducted from their wages in installments. In addition, they can receive a small kerosene lamp, a sweat scraper, a hand pestle, and a set of burlap ore bags. In terms of food, they eat red rice and old mother soup (soybean soup) every day. Both of these contain large amounts of vitamins, and the "Sha Ding" rely entirely on them for nutrition. Gejiu has a severe water shortage, and drinking water is a major problem. In times of water scarcity, water must be used to wash the ore, making it extremely precious. The "Sha Ding" have a saying: "Wash your face and don't drink the soup, drink the soup and don't wash your face."</p>
<p>The "Sha Ding's" living quarters, where they cook and eat together, are commonly called "kitchens". They are built of random stones and mud, with straw covering the roof. The four walls have no windows, and there is insufficient sunlight and air, but they are slightly better than the mine tunnels. Cruel mine owners even force them to live with mules. When the reporter leaned inside, I felt nauseous because the inside was filled with smoke and dust, and the excrement of mules and horses flowed everywhere, like being in a public toilet on the street.</p>
<p>Dangerous Tunnels Filled with Unjust Souls</p>
<p>Due to the lack of safety equipment in most factory tunnels, many "Sha Ding" die each year from accidents such as tunnel collapses. Skin diseases and other illnesses caused by humidity and filth are also common. Typhoid, cholera, dysentery, stomach problems, skin diseases, parasitic diseases, and respiratory diseases are rampant in the mining area. A folk song in the factory area says: "The factory area is damp and dirty, there are no latrines, the diet is irregular, and there is no concern for hot or cold. In May and June every year, illnesses are unusually common. Look at the desolate wilderness, corpses are abandoned by the roadside. Who doesn't have a wife and children? Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have compassion? Who doesn't have a heart? Seeing this heartbreaking scene, they forget everything for money!" This short folk song vividly portrays the miserable lives of the "Sha Ding".</p>
<p>Public Mine Owners Pay Attention to Welfare</p>
<p>The management of the Tin Industry Company is certainly more reasonable, and they strive to improve the lives of the "Sha Ding". For example, the implementation of an eight-hour work system is a fair measure. In addition, there are holidays, weekly rests, and established methods for overtime and rewards. They have also organized a Workers' Advancement Association, which includes a supply cooperative, a literacy school, an arts and crafts group, and a recreation group, so that miners can have welfare facilities in addition to work. They also pay special attention to medical and health care. These are all things that other private mine owners in the Gejiu mining area should emulate.</p>
<p>In short, it is a fact that the "Sha Ding" in the mining area work hard and live in poverty. For the sake of national health and labor welfare, from any point of view, we should speak out on their behalf. The goals should be to improve their wages and improve their lives!</p>

<h3>Appeal to the Academic Community for Self-Control and Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>Editor: Recently, student movements have sprung up across the country, evolving from local demands to unified actions. Their slogans and propaganda have exceeded the bounds of national morality and state law, clearly indicating that someone is orchestrating them behind the scenes. Everyone knows that the country urgently needs stability at present, and only after stability can construction be undertaken. Only the Chinese Communist Party and a few dangerous elements have other agendas,妄想奪取政權, so since August of the previous year, although the government has repeatedly invited CCP leaders to discuss peace plans, the government has repeatedly made concessions, compromising and seeking reconciliation, the CCP has never been sincere, advancing step by step, so that negotiations have been fruitless. Recently, the constitution has been passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the National Government. The National Government has also been reorganized, accommodating many people from other parties and social elites. This shows that the government is indeed actively preparing to implement constitutional government. Only the CCP and its followers not only refuse to participate in the government, but also want to overthrow the constitution that has been deliberated and passed by the National Assembly representatives. Communist troops are harassing everywhere, and the CCP and its followers are instigating workers and students in major cities to carry out strikes and demonstrations, hoping to disrupt public order and echo the Communist army. We believe that democracy should be based on the rule of law. If the implementation of democracy disregards the rule of law, the result will inevitably degenerate into mob rule. The actions of students in various places, surrounding agencies, cursing officials, interfering in school administration, and even forcing classmates to strike, completely disregard the rule of law, violate the spirit of democracy, and are clearly excessive behaviors. Good students should certainly be protected. Why aren't the rioters sanctioned? The state runs education to cultivate talent, not to accommodate rioters. Therefore, we ask the government to severely punish any level that takes excessive action. If the identity of CCP members is confirmed, they should be detained and sent to the CCP-occupied areas, so that they can no longer operate in various regions under the rule of the National Government, so that discipline can be rectified and society can be stabilized. Nearly ten of my relatives and children are currently studying at Jiaotong University and Jinan University. Because rioters forced them to strike and even threatened them with pistols, making them unreasonable, they had no choice but to ask for leave to return home to rest. I sincerely hope that the government authorities will quickly deal with this matter so that the majority of good students can continue their studies. Your newspaper is an authority on public opinion, so please do your best to advocate and urge the government to deal with it as soon as possible, and at the same time advise blindly following students that saving the country depends on knowledge, and do not be used by ambitious elements to make unnecessary sacrifices. (Respectfully submitted by reader Zhang Dihua)</p>
<p>Scenes from the Life of a "Sha Ding":</p>

<h3>Green Willow Village - Continued Dreams of Yangzhou, Part 18</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Teahouses outside Yangzhou city that have a close relationship with tourists, such as Green Willow Village, Fragrant Shadow Pavilion, Qingsheng, and Zhichun, are all located on both sides of the suspension bridge in the northern suburbs. In the past, young people and women mostly liked to go to Green Willow Village, while older people preferred to stay at Fragrant Shadow Pavilion, probably because Fragrant Shadow Pavilion has a long history and an elegant name, making it easy for them to express nostalgic feelings.</p>
<p>Wang Yuyang's "Remembering Red Bridge" in the style of "Huanxi Sha" says: "A clear stream flows in the northern suburbs, the scenery of Red Willow is autumnal in my eyes, Green Willow city walls are Yangzhou." It seems that Green Willow is a unique symbol of Yangzhou. Since Yangzhou is called Green Willow city walls, it is natural to have a Green Willow Village teahouse to embellish it.</p>
<p>However, the Green Willow Village of the past is significantly different from the current Green Willow Village. The Green Willow Village of the past was almost entirely shrouded in willow smoke. White cloth flags were hung high on the treetops, with the three words "Green Willow Village" written in bright red. From a distance, it was quite reminiscent of the feeling of "a single red dot in a sea of green, captivating spring scenery needs no more." I remember my late father pointing to these three words "Green Willow Village" and asking me what I could pair with "White flag, red letters, Green Willow Village." At the time, I struggled to think of something. My father laughed and said I could pair it with "Blue stone, blue writing, Osmanthus Ridge." Unfortunately, I still don't know where Osmanthus Ridge is.</p>
<p>Green Willow Village faces the city river and is close to Red Bridge. Behind it is an earthen hill, which is the main road. There are no walls around it, and only a wooden sign with the three words "Green Willow Village" is erected at the entrance, which is considered the signboard. There used to be a small plank bridge here. Whenever dusk fell and the tourists had left, standing on the bridge and humming the lines "Standing alone on the small bridge, sleeves full of wind, after the setting moon in the forest, people return home," would add a lot of poetic and artistic charm.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, there is a short earthen road along the river, filled with large and small tourist boats. The more attractive boat girls wait here for customers. On the other side is a short bamboo fence. Inside the bamboo fence, there is an earthen hill, and a pavilion stands proudly. The hill is covered with bamboo and trees. Many people like to lie on rattan chairs in this area, sipping tea while leisurely gazing at the boats on the river from the gaps in the green shade, forgetting the passage of time and the disturbances of the world. This is the most elegant place in Green Willow Village, and it is also the most attractive place in Green Willow Village.</p>
<p>In addition, water is drawn into the interior from under the small bridge, forming a small lotus pond. On the north side of the lotus pond, there are several low houses. Each faces south and has a short railing with bamboo tables and chairs inside. From here, you can see the tea drinkers coming and going in Green Willow Village, and you can also see the boats on the river from afar. This is a place where people with families like to stay, and it is also a happy place for lovers to whisper sweet nothings. At the end of the earthen road, there is an extremely large open hall. You can fish on the side facing the river. Sparse fishing rods are reflected on the green water. The anglers have the joy of Haoliang, and the tourists who see it also feel it is elegant and pleasant. There are also some other tea-selling houses, but they are all located inside, far from the river. From the perspective of sightseeing, they are not as good as the above three places.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these situations are all in the past. The short earthen road in Green Willow Village has become a pedestrian avenue. The small bridge is gone, and so is the bamboo fence. Many of the bamboo and trees have been cut down, and there is no longer any willow smoke. In addition, the side facing the river is surrounded by a short wall. Occasionally entering it, it is a desolate scene, and there is even the feeling that the plank bridge is "not very visible in the sky." It is said that after the Anti-Japanese War, the owner has changed. Perhaps the minds of the old and new owners are different, which is why Green Willow Village has changed so much, not only because of the chaos of war!</p>
<h3>The Realm of Art</h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>Due to the development of art, although直觀arts such as sculpture and painting can give people a sense of satisfaction to some extent, their realm, in their essence, at most only achieves "beauty." However, the realm of "beauty" alone is narrow. Therefore, some aesthetic works are not easily appreciated by the public.</p>
<p>Since the aesthetic nature of art has problems, it is of course necessary to expand its realm. Thus, the two realms of truth and goodness appear. This enriches the content of literature and art.</p>
<h3>Short Note</h3>
<p>— Li Weichu</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the most painful day of your life will also be the day I remember most deeply. At the same time, it is also the first time I have seen the most solemn impression of the end of life. I will never forget it!</p>
<p>Without a hint of falsehood, my heart was most sorrowful yesterday, because it was the first time I met the most kind mother, the most gentle mother, the most enlightened mother, Wei Ci! Although this mother is yours, from the first time we met, we planted respect and love. There is solemnity and emotion. Children all over the world love this kind of old person. Didn't I once frankly express my envy to you? And didn't you say: "All mothers in the world are equally great?" How long ago was that…… So I cannot restrain my tears. Every memory increases a burst of grief.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I returned home for a long time and still couldn't erase the scenes I had experienced. Waking up in the morning, recalling the kind face, the gentle smile, the soft and quiet voice, I couldn't help but shed a few tears again, Wei Ci! I turned to think of you; suddenly losing so much, so great, so profound, so heavy, so important all of this, every time I saw a scene that evoked memories, I thought of your sorrow! Poor child, how can you bear it! But, Wei Ci! I want to comfort you! Life is ruthless, the physical body cannot last forever, and the shell will always disappear and be destroyed, but the spiritual life of the old people lives in the hearts of each of your children.</p>
<p>Writing these few lines, I originally wanted to comfort you, but at this point I don't know how to express it! You are an extremely intelligent person, and you will be able to free yourself from the sorrow and pain that this world has given you. You must think that your mother is still living in this room, she can hear your weeping, and she can also see your tearful face, so you must live as she used to love you.</p>
<p>Wei Ci! How many times have I thought of the impermanence of the physical body, the impermanence of life, and the ruthlessness of the destruction of life! My soul wants to escape from this world and ascend, so for so many years I have not been able to live like the secular world, and for so many years, I am still tirelessly writing, being a person, and arduously pursuing an ideal, an immortal truth, Wei Ci! Youth and beauty are lovely and moving, but they are also fleeting, so they are the least reliable. The physical body and matter cannot last forever, so it must disappear and be destroyed. No matter how much sincere love, weeping and wailing, can bring back the ruthlessness of the departed life! Taking away the dearest person and the loving heart. Therefore, for so many years, I would rather endure material hardships and endless torment, but also pursue a kind of ideal spiritual life, that is eternal and immortal!</p>
<p>I often think: if I had been born twenty years earlier, with my thoughts, emotions, and personality, I would definitely have entered the empty gate and converted to the Three Truths. But in this era, I am going to tirelessly and unyieldingly pursue an eternal and immortal existence. If you think like this, think about these things, maybe you can slightly reduce the sorrow in your heart? You know, Mom hasn't gone, Mom is scattered in your lives, so you must take care and cherish yourself!</p>
<p>I want to comfort you well, don't provoke your sadness, but if you want to cry, just cry; good Wei Ci! Crying may make you feel better. But, you must take care, don't let Mom worry in that world, and take care of each other in this world, as Mom loved you in the past.</p>
<p>These days, I want to see you, send my concern to you, and greet your other three people, bless you!</p>
<h3>Waste</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>At dusk or twilight, in the city or the countryside, we often encounter a person who carries a box filled with discarded items that are precious to him.</p>
<p>Waste? Apart from the arguments in books about "waste utilization," these useless things are by no means waste. Like zero and infinity, which can never be grasped, the closer something is to uselessness, the more infinite hopes it can be placed upon.</p>
<p>A broken tile, a small stone picked up from the riverbank, a piece of green glass bottle, a piece of patterned cloth, a tin can... If people haven't forgotten their childhood, these treasures would be treasured in their pockets, just like adults carrying locked leather bags.</p>
<p>After becoming "adults," we occasionally encounter these situations again: when we see two children quietly talking to a cardboard box or a blade of grass, we might laugh, not a knowing laugh, but feeling that the children are too naive. After the children become adults, we cleverly replace those waste items with banknotes, which are more useful. From then on, we close the door to that belonging to the innocent fantasy, but can it be closed?</p>
<p>Never, a stamp or a ticket stub with a corner cut off, a maple leaf or a petal replace those glass and tiles.</p>
<p>People put down this and then pick up that, until they are old: an old woman has a string of prayer beads, and an old man has a fake antique. A strand of hair, a cigarette butt, and a handful of sand become the most meaningful and priceless objects in the world.</p>
<p>A mushroom, overnight, makes millions of neat little folds, even the most incredible sculptor is surprised. The creation of a flower and a fruit is an engineering project that lasts for years and months. Even the smallest and most insignificant thing may contain a universe, and even the most rigid and immobile thing has life.</p>
<p>This life, this universe is less on top of these things than it is in our hearts. Life always has to have a basis, but a confidant, a lover, no one is as loyal as these little things.</p>
<p>A grain of sand contains a world. A handful of soil ignites the passion of a musician, the hardships and joys of a vast land; a work of nostalgia and anger appears. A handful of soil falls into the hands of a sculptor, and he捏makes his wish, an "學西"and a "巴爾扎克"流出from his hands.</p>
<p>Cherish these trivial things, don't laugh at the rag pickers.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Keng Qiang</p>
<p>Poetry is a bee with a sting, it uses honey to soothe good souls and stings to pierce false masks.</p>
<h3>Words from the Bi Xiang Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>To the Tune of *Man Ting Fang* – Sitting by the Moon</p>
<p>Dew wets the murmuring whispers, cold chills jade arms; a clear sky is neatly divided. Leaning on the balustrade, the flower shadows are naturally graceful. Ten thousand miles of boundless sky is like water, beyond the distant mountains, neither mist nor smoke. Raising my cup, I toast, this fine night of the fifteenth, people and moon perfectly round. Entwined, infinite thoughts, difficult to convey with brush and ink, I idly compose on silver stationery; yet I sit facing the beauty, secretly regretting her splendor. I wish to call upon Chang'e to rise and dance, but the Lunar Palace is far, who can gather all the immortals? At the place of gazing, containing affection, wanting to speak, leisurely appreciation prevents sleep.</p>
<p>To the Tune of *Chu Jiang Qiu Dan*</p>
<p>The Chu River is serenely clear in autumn, just as evening skies are clean of clouds, a season of light cold. With hands behind my back, the west wind comes and goes, startling the red leaves tinged with frost. Wild grasses entwine with yellow, sparse woods fade to green, a vast landscape of smoky villages. Bean flowers and thatched cottages, who painted them with such pure and exquisite beauty?  Alas, time flows like a steed glimpsed through a crack, childhood revisited, years passed in empty review. I wish to borrow Lu Yang's hand to hold back the setting sun, awakening heroes of the Central Plains. Such mountains and rivers, such scenery remains, how can I bear to see the golden goblet incomplete? On the road home, without words, a chest full of shattered bright moonlight.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare: Sonnet 57</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhen Qin</p>
<p>Being your slave, what should I do, if not to serve you, according to your pleasure? My time is utterly worthless, and I have nothing to do but await your command, my emperor! As I keep watch over the clock for you, I dare not curse the endless time, nor speak of the bitterness of painful separation. If, once, you bid your servant farewell! I dare not, with jealousy, inquire where you have gone, or guess at your delights, but like a sorrowful slave, without a single thought, only think: that you make those around you rejoice. Love is truly like a fool, no matter what you do, he always believes you mean well, and nothing more. Neither bronze, stone, earth, nor the vast waves, can escape being ruled by death, how then can beauty, whose power is weaker than a flower, resist that stern death? Oh, sweet summer breezes, how can they withstand time's daily violent assault, when even rocks and steel doors, however strong, must be destroyed by time? Oh, terrible thought! Time's truth, alas! How can one escape being gathered into time's coffers? Which powerful arm can pull back his swift feet? Who can forbid his act of plundering beauty? Oh, no one can, unless this miracle has the power to make my love forever bright in words. When I am dead, grieve for me no more, only when you hear the mournful knell warning the world that I have left sin and gone to dwell with worms. When you read this poem, do not think of the hand that wrote it; for I love you too much, and if you thought of me you would suffer, so I wish to be forgotten in your sweet thoughts. Oh, I say, when you see this poem, if I am already lying with the soil; then please do not speak my name; it would be best if your love were buried with me; lest clever people see through your sighs, and after my death ridicule you with it.</p>
<p>Sonnet 73 You can see this season in me, when the yellow leaves have all fallen, or a few still hang on the branches that tremble in the cold, the desolate choir loft of the birds of yesterday. You can see such an evening in me: when the light of the setting sun has already declined to the west, and night, like the incarnation of death, slowly drives away dusk, locking everything into peace. You can see this kind of fire in me, burning on the ashes of its own youth, like the bed it must die on, destroyed along with the fuel that feeds it. Seeing these things, your love will grow stronger, loving well what you are about to lose.</p>
<p>Sonnet 87 As waves rush towards the shore, so does my time rush towards decline; each minute taking away the one before, contending to move forward in haste. My guiding star first allowed me to be born in the sea of light, heading towards the peak of maturity, yet eclipses insist on competing with it, and time reclaims its old gifts. Time pierces the splendor of youth, digging wrinkles on the brow of beauty, devouring rare natural beauty, everything is cut flat by its knife. Away with its poisonous hands! My poems will still praise you in the future.</p>
<h3>A Painting of Weary Sighs</h3>
<p>— Xu Ju'an</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood (516)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Oh, what's happening now?" Hejian asked, flustered.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid these few characters aren't listening, and are acting up again... But it doesn't matter..."</p>
<p>Shouyi had just said this when he heard two light taps on the door. Before he could answer, the door had already opened. It was Zhengyan who had come; his expression was extremely anxious.</p>
<p>"Team leader, '012' and '02' both have urgent messages, asking the team leader to issue orders quickly. They say things are likely beyond salvage! ... They suspect that the Konoe cabinet has already signed the departure order..." As he spoke, Zhengyan's expression became even more tense.</p>
<p>"I know, Lao Yan, but what can one person do? ... But at twelve o'clock, no matter how things are here, whether Pingzi can get out, and no matter what instructions are hidden in Elder Aoki's ink circles, I have no choice but to use my old trick to give them a big shake-up. Whether it's effective or not, we'll just have to leave it to fate."</p>
<p>Hejian's old trick, of course, was to use telecommunications to create several false messages that would be unfavorable to the Japanese launch of their grand plan. First, he would try to pour cold water on their raging flames of private desire, perhaps sweeping away some of the military's enthusiasm, and putting the planned schedule on hold for a while.</p>
<p>"It's easy to handle now," Shouyi said suddenly. "Just now I was thinking; assuming we rushed to Hongzhen, there's no one here to relay the message. I'm afraid that Li Ming and the others on both sides, and the two groups of people we've already launched, will be waiting in vain on the Bund at the appointed time - they must wait for the two of us to arrive before heading towards Hongzhen... If we don't hurry there now, look, it's only nine forty-five, if we don't hurry there, I'm afraid that group of mischievous ones will start before us, and ruin the big plan."</p>
<p>It turned out that Shouyi had not heard Hejian's telephone message. At this time, he was still thinking about the problem on the Hongzhen side. His mind was focused, and he didn't pay attention to Zhengyan's report, and Hejian's opinion, so he only paid attention to the local situation; "I think, let's leave now, and let Zhengyan guard here... If they have a phone call, ask them to quickly go to Hongzhen to provide support, and tell them that the plan has changed, and we have to go ahead first."</p>
<p>"Why not call our three sides right now, ! Bai Ren Manor, Han Fang, Ben Ming -?" Hejian suggested.</p>
<p>"It's too late... They've all set off separately and piecemeal in advance, they're all on the road now, there's no way to make phone calls... It's okay, let Zhengyan go to the Bund first," Shouyi changed his mind again, "If our people come, the password is '0915,' after passing the password, tell them to rush there separately, anyway, we've already spread out our lines of scouts on the Hongzhen side."</p>
<p>"Team leader," Zhengyan was driving the car, speeding towards the Bund, when he suddenly called out to Hejian.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Wasn't that maid at Wansui Hall off duty and going home?"</p>
<p>"I know, didn't you tell me that?" Hejian replied in the back compartment.</p>
<p>"Didn't the team leader pay some attention to that maid?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suspect her actions are unusual; didn't you say she's also a veteran worker in the Han Fang group?"</p>
<p>"That's right, but..."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Hejian heard that Zhengyan's words had something more to them.</p>
<p>"She committed suicide!"</p>
<p>"Oh... Why?" Hejian was taken aback.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk from a Moored Boat</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>As the poet says well:</p>
<p>"In such a world, whether good intentions, kindness, friendship, love, loyalty, compassion... beside the evil of self-interest, money, privilege... etc., has completely lost its color, the greed and hunger before one's eyes cannot be healed by distant love. The values recognized by the world are tangible objects, while hope and ideals are mocked as foolish dreams. In fact, aren't these seemingly empty things that the dreamers are singing about today the more real reality and more perfect benefits of the future? Aren't the martyrs of ancient times considered, in the eyes of the world, as people who cannot even manage their own lives? They 'extravagantly talk' about beautiful statements, yet cannot even preserve this shattered one. Therefore, in today's secular world, true vanity is seen as reality, and true value is instead regarded as an illusion."</p>
<p>I have a good friend, who also explains it very thoroughly with a writer's mind. He believes that for a writer, being morbid (I think these two words should be carefully considered and appreciated by the reader) cannot be considered bad, and in a broader and deeper sense, all creators are morbid. You see, what others don't feel, he feels; what others don't consider a big event, he considers a big event; what others consider ordinary, he considers extraordinary; what others don't think is worth a laugh, he thinks is worth crying about... Isn't this morbidity? But precisely because he is morbid, he feels more sharply than ordinary people, and his explosions are more intense, thus giving ordinary people a kind of awakening, encouragement, impetus, and spur in real life. This is the true value of ordinary poets.</p>

<h3>First Concert by the Listening Sound Conservatory</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>The National Shanghai Listening Sound Conservatory held its first concert of teachers and students after its relocation on the 18th and 19th of this month at the Lyceum Theatre. In addition to the choir program, the programs on the two days were different, with teachers and students each accounting for half. The concert mobilized an eighty-person choir and ten famous professors from the school to participate in the performance. This is a grand event in the Shanghai music scene this year.</p>
<p>After listening to this concert, I couldn't help but be ecstatic about the many new musical talents that are being nurtured. Because of limited space, here I will only give a general description of a few of the programs and performers with the most distinctive achievements.</p>
<p>Regarding the students, I must first recommend Zhu Yaqing's piano solo. She soloed Bach and Rachmaninoff's "E Major Prelude" and Liszt's "Opera Rigoletto Italian". Her pure and skilled technique and her ability to understand the richness of the music were very successful. The second piece was played with great appeal, showing a perfect mastery. Secondly, the baritone Li Zhishu's solo had a full tone, a wide and deep volume, and he could control it freely. His portrayal of the music's emotions was quite skillful. There is no doubt that he will become an outstanding bass in our country. Huang Tangxin's violin solo had extremely flexible bowing and fingering, and she has a good chance of becoming a famous violinist; her performance of Rode's "A Minor Seventh Concerto" was beautiful and moving, and she was able to express the emotions of the music.</p>
<p>Regarding the professors, this time it was very rare that we heard several famous professors' solos and recitals. The cello solo, Professor Dukson's performance of Chopin's "Nocturne in D-flat Major", was deeply moving and fascinating! It immersed the audience's emotions in a gentle, tranquil, yet slightly melancholic musical tone. Professor Foa's violin solo displayed a high degree of skill, and he and Professor Magolinsky's piano coordinated very well. Madame Magolinsky sang five pieces by Mozart, Mendelssohn, and Brahms. This outstanding lyrical soprano had a beautiful tone and excellent expression. Professor Magolinsky's accompaniment helped her a lot, highlighting the beauty of the music's emotions everywhere. What I was most moved by was Magolinsky's piano solo. He soloed two piano pieces by Liszt adapted from Wagner's opera "The Flying Dutchman". His highly polished technique and grand spirit captured the audience in the entire hall. In the slow sections, the contrast between loud and soft was clear, and the rise and fall were pleasing to the ear; in the tense sections, the power was like thunder, but every note could be heard clearly. If one closed one's eyes and listened quietly, it was as if one was listening to a piano solo by the modern piano master Paderewski. The only "chamber music" program in this concert - the trio, Professors Foa (violin), Shekson (cello), and Magolinsky (piano) played Beethoven's "Trio in B-flat Major", which was extremely wonderful. They were able to display their strengths and cooperate, making people feel deeply moved by this brilliant and powerful work of the music saint.</p>
<p>As for the choral program, the two days were the same, singing the "Kyrie" and "Agnus Dei" from Mozart's "Mass", conducted by Professor B Zhaozhi. On the first day, the voices of the sections felt slightly out of tune, but the results were better on the second day. These two choruses fully revealed the pious, profound, and powerful religious meaning.</p>
<h3>High Heels</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Male A: Who invented high heels?</p>
<p>Male B: A beautiful little girl, people always kissed her forehead.</p>
<h3>Movie Fan</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Female A: That's a comet.</p>
<p>Female B: What's a?</p>
<p>Female A: A comet. You always know what a comet is, right?</p>
<p>Female B: No.</p>
<p>Female A: A star with a tail trailing behind it, you don't even know that?</p>
<p>Female B: Oh, so it's Mickey Mouse.</p>
<h3>"Chang'e"</h3>
<p>— Ma Gao</p>
<p>The author uses a folk tale to write this play, intending to satirize "Hou Yi-style" characters who are obsessed with military force through this myth. This idea is commendable, and it does indeed have many superficial successes, such as the exquisite lines, which have gained the audience's sharp "sense of the times." However, after a calm and quiet study, it is found that it only fully expresses the author's cleverness and witty talent. Because in this play, Chang'e's sorrow occupies too much of the composition, as well as too much showing off of novel and elaborate techniques. As the basic driving force of resistance - the people - in this play is merely a "supporting role that has become the main character," and it does not delve deeper into them or describe them, so that the death of Hou Yi at the hands of these pitiful insects seems a little impossible. This is not the right path for creation. Overly catering to the audience, manipulating techniques, and using the audience's intuition have the scent of speculation and profiteering.</p>
<p>The director appears disorganized here, and has not even determined the structure of such a play. It should be completely stylized, but the current state of the play is messy and mixed, with the set, costumes, and acting each going their own way.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Zhang Fa is good material, and he put a lot of effort into the character of Hou Yi, and there were some wonderful parts. Chang'e, Lü En seems unsuitable, her physique is too strong, especially when she is placed together with her three "little" sisters, it looks very uncomfortable. In her childhood, her innocence and liveliness were "acted" out, and after she was established as the queen, the audience only saw her "acting" in an ancient costume "play." Wu Gang, played by Xia Tian, ​​is one of his relatively poor performances in his several plays. He used his usual tricks, and did not have any new discoveries, so he was not outstanding at all. He Lu's Feng Meng has a spirit of integrity, but his muscles are not relaxed enough, which makes many scenes rigid.</p>
<p>As for the design of the costumes, I feel that there is a need for reconsideration. Not to mention that Chang'e's era is too far away to be researched, so it is just copied casually. Putting them together with the cave-dwelling set on stage is also inappropriate. Especially some of the so-called "extra" actors, even the 20th-century undershirts were seen by the audience, which seems unacceptable.</p>
<p>But, I don't say that this play is a bad play, why! Because it is more or less close to "reality," and this can be proved from the audience's reaction. I really don't want to say that it is a masterpiece, because it is incomplete and not profound.</p>
<h3>Professor Byrne on Smoking</h3>
<p>— Cun Yuan</p>
<p>Why does the first cigarette of the day taste particularly good? Someone took this question to Professor J.H. Byrne of the University of Oxford's Faculty of Pharmacy. He said, "Before you smoke your cigarette tomorrow morning, you can first sit in a chair and count your pulse. After you've counted, go smoke your cigarette. Then, within ten minutes, you'll find that your pulse has started to rise, from 70 beats per minute to 80, or even 90. At the same time, if you're willing to ask a doctor or nurse to measure your blood pressure, then you'll find that your blood pressure has also risen by about one inch."</p>
<p>"So, if smoking is harmful, what exactly are the harms"? In response to this question, Professor Byrne said, "We are now able to prove that the nicotine inhaled when smoking excretes a hormone from the pituitary gland in the brain, which we call Holland's, allowing it to seep into the blood.</p>
<p>"This hormone has the following effect on the heart - the heart's action allows blood to flow throughout the body, and the thick heart wall alternates between contracting and relaxing. This heart wall is made up of many living cells, and each cell needs a supply of air to do its job. Therefore, there is also a fine system of blood vessels within the heart wall.</p>
<p>"The hormone from the pituitary gland can narrow these blood vessels, thus reducing the blood supply to the heart. Therefore, an athlete must never smoke while training. If he smokes, the cells in his heart will only be able to get less blood, and he won't be able to run as well."</p>
<p>So, are there any scientific reasons for smoking? Professor Byrne's answer is: "We know that the blood vessels within the heart wall, i.e., the coronary arteries, often have problems in the fifty to sixty-year age group. Some doctors have long suspected that smoking is very related to this heart disease. Now that we know that smoking can allow the hormone from the pituitary gland to seep into the blood, then we can easily see a possible explanation for their point of view. However, we are still unable to clearly understand whether there is any relationship between smoking and coronary artery disease."</p>
<h3>The Organization and Reform of Small Seal Script</h3>
<p>— Dong Meng</p>
<p>Small seal script still has an important place in today's culture, and must not be ignored as an aesthetic appreciation; because official and private seals, and the most noble state seal, "The Seal of the Republic of China," are all made using small seal script. However, currently, when seal engravers want to use small seal script, they all rely on the "Shuowen Jiezi" as the only reference specimen, and there are no other books that can guide them. Therefore, regarding small seal script that cannot be found when applied, they have to imitate it according to their own psychology. As long as the form is similar, and it is close to reason, that is enough. Thus, seal engravers who are not proficient in seal studies engrave in a chaotic and unorganized manner, which is not in accordance with the system. Moreover, seals are used on documents to show faith and adherence, which is of the utmost importance. How can seal engravers be allowed to fabricate them at will? However, there is no prescribed template from the state, so it is no wonder that seal engravers do this, because they cannot find a clear path, resulting in numerous errors in people's private seals, and sometimes even official seals are engraved incorrectly. Therefore, in the current century, since seal script is still needed because of its relationship with seals, then the government authorities should take this opportunity to compile a "Nationally Approved Correct Seal Script Dictionary," adding the missing seal characters, to serve as a national seal template for all ages; this would not only be very beneficial to culture, but also a landmark reform, and it is a very necessary thing.</p>
<p>Now, because of the limited space, I will simply raise a few characters for discussion: for example, the surname Bian "卞," the "checkpoints" "卡," the "sail" "帆," these are all very common characters, but there are actually none in small seal script, or they are borrowed from other characters. Others such as "氣" and "乞," "刀" and "刁" are not distinguished, and "亨," "享," and "烹" are all represented by one character, etc. There are many such cases, and it is necessary to correct and distinguish them. If this humble opinion is adopted by the government authorities; then it will also be necessary for domestic seal script experts to seriously refer to it.</p>
<h3>The Education of Prodigies</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>I don't know if it's a sign of national auspiciousness, or a result of the nation's superior genes, but recently, our country has been producing prodigies one after another. A few months ago, a commissioner in Henan province was competing with others for a child prodigy. That child was originally a wandering orphan, but because he was a child prodigy, nutrients and dried goods were fought over by everyone to claim kinship. Later, somewhere in Taiwan province, another child prodigy appeared, who is said to have written a novel of several hundred thousand words. Moreover, it is a masterpiece that reflects the times and has rich content. Now, we see someone introducing a child prodigy in the newspaper again. It says that he "began to practice calligraphy at a young age, and loved to wield the brush… with vigorous and unrestrained strokes, as if dragons were dancing and phoenixes were flying," this is of course a calligrapher.</p>
<p>It seems that China has been producing child prodigies since ancient times. It is said that Wang Bo wrote the Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng at the age of seven, and Kong Rong, Sima Guang, and Han Yu were all child prodigies. Now that education and culture are more advanced and widespread than before, child prodigies will naturally also increase in production. But what I find strange is that these child prodigies often become obscure later on. It seems that child prodigies are only "miraculous in childhood"; after childhood, they are just ordinary people! Or even worse than ordinary people.</p>
<p>According to the views of biology, any good seed must have good germination and results. Then, if one is called a child prodigy, he must also become a great talent in the future. But why do our child prodigies all fade away like ephemeral flowers? Is it really like the saying about women: "Beauty" is destined to have a short life? Or is it still the case that "he was clever as a child," but he is not certain as an adult?</p>
<p>Regarding this difficult question of "child prodigy" but not "miraculous person," I later got an answer from a biologist. He said: It is not difficult to make a plant bloom and bear fruit early! You only need to cut off a few more roots of it, or damage some of the bark. Otherwise, you can just give it excessive nourishment. But in this way, its life will not last long. Because it has lost the proper beauty or received too much favor!</p>
<p>So I thought that the loss of our child prodigies is also the same! In society, for a child who "has a special talent in childhood," if he belongs to the class of wealth and power, his parents and relatives will naturally keep him in the greenhouse. If he comes from a poor family, there will also be a group of well-meaning people to take care of him. But these people who hope their son will become a dragon all hope to quickly recoup a sum of money, so the education they provide is a means of forcing growth. They either give the child prodigy excessive nutrients, or cut off his roots and stems. Such a child prodigy will eventually either have a short life, or become an "ungodly" person!</p>
<h3>Fighting Poison with Poison</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Madam, after you went out, the young master swallowed a stink bug. But don't worry, I've already given him a packet of stink bug powder.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Barely more than a week had passed, and Liuzhou quickly followed Guilin to become a city in peril directly threatened by enemy cavalry. Thus, as usual, came a series of evacuations, emergency evacuations, air raids, chaos, retreats, and exiles...</p>
<p>It was a brutally hot autumn morning. After expending tremendous effort, Old Zhu and the entire troupe—including Lan and Feifei—finally arrived in Jinchengjiang one after another.</p>
<p>The night before, Lan had already developed a fever and eaten nothing. She climbed onto the truck with everyone else; the mountain wind blew in gusts, and she felt her body shivering. However, she tried her best to remain calm, saying nothing, simply wrapping a white woolen blanket tightly around herself. Others mostly knew she had never been one to talk much, so no one noticed she was feeling cold, feverish, and shivering.</p>
<p>An exhausted Feifei was fast asleep in her arms, her plump head pressing against Lan's chest, making it difficult for her to breathe. But she didn't want to interrupt her beloved daughter's sweet sleep, so she endured it with great effort.</p>
<p>It wasn't until everyone got off the truck in Jinchengjiang that Old Zhu saw her pale face and her swaying body about to collapse, and he rushed over to inquire anxiously.</p>
<p>When he helped her off the truck, her icy cold fingers startled him even more.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? You're quite ill!"</p>
<p>Lan shook her head and gave him a bitter smile. However, she couldn't hold on any longer. Old Zhu planned to help her go to a small teahouse near the military station to rest, but after walking only four or five steps, Lan's body suddenly sank, almost causing Old Zhu to fall as well.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Lu! Hurry! Hurry!" Old Zhu immediately dropped the small suitcase in his left hand and held her up with both arms, while shouting frantically at the limping Lu, who was walking ahead.</p>
<p>"Don't panic! It's not... serious, I just... feel a little dizzy," Lan said in an extremely faint voice, trying to comfort Old Zhu.</p>
<p>Old Zhu didn't say much more to her. He and Lu Qian quickly divided up on the left and right, and supported her.</p>
<p>Feifei was sitting in the small teahouse with Zhang Chang and the others. When she saw her mother in this state, she immediately burst into tears. Fortunately, there were many people in the troupe, and they were often wandering outside, so everyone had some emergency experience. Some called for boiling water, some fetched medicine, some coaxed Feifei… finally, after a dozen minutes, they managed to revive Lan, who was on the verge of fainting.</p>
