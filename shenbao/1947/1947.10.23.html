<p>所陳述。彼稱：余不輕估中國所面臨之困難，亦不對中央政府所受之批評有所爭辯，但余堅信</p>
<p>蔣主席之決心，彼係依照民主方針，獻身於中國之解救者，彼強調若遠東與世界和平得能確保</p>

<p>華盛頓新聞等其他該系報紙謂，不發表魏</p>

<p>秘性。亦未能使美國人民深悉美政府對華政策究係如何。某評論家並懷疑是否馬歇爾關務卿認</p>
<p>爲中國「改革工作」尙不能適合渠所定立即大量援華所需之條件。如此一揣測屬實。該評論家</p>
<p>認爲則馬氏實已忽視中國方面自渠年前離華後業已呈現之一整個新形勢。渠幷認爲，中國目前</p>
<p>之問題，已非已純內政改革問題，而係一與共黨作生死存亡爭鬥之問題。</p>

<h3>社論　琉球必須歸還中國</h3>
<p>自從張行政院長出席駐會參政員會議，報吿</p>
<p>我國軍政外交措施，愼重提及：「琉球與我國關</p>
<p>係特殊。應歸還中國」後，華盛頓和東京方面，</p>
<p>對於我國的這一要求，都予以深切注意。本來，</p>
<p>關於日本領土的範圍，一九四三年十一月開羅會</p>
<p>議宣言僅決定：「東北四省，台灣，澎湖羣島等</p>
<p>歸還中華民國」。對於琉球未來地位，並未提及</p>
<p>。一九四五年七月波茨坦宣言，貫澈開羅宣言之</p>
<p>精神，規定：「日本之主權限於本州·北海道·</p>
<p>九州·四國及吾人所決定之其他小島」，是琉球</p>
<p>地位，仍懸而待決。日本外相蘆田均和老議員尾</p>
<p>崎行雄說：琉球應屬日本，並曲解波茨坦宣言所</p>
<p>指之「其他小島」，係包括琉球羣島等而言。琉</p>
<p>球人民反對日本的曲解，我國學者更列舉史實說</p>
<p>明中琉關係，大多主張琉球應歸還我國。</p>
<p>我們站在研究立塲，根據琉球史地及人文諸</p>
<p>關係，擁護政府的見解，並向盟國愼重聲明：琉</p>
<p>球必須歸還中國！</p>
<p>琉球與亞洲國家發生政治關係，最早的是中</p>
<p>國。在我國古書中，隋稱「流求」，唐作「琉求</p>
<p>」，「留仇」，或「流虬」，元代始見「琉球」</p>
<p>一名，以後便沿用至今。根據大英百科全書「琉</p>
<p>球」一節所載，中國和琉球的關係，可以追溯到</p>
<p>公元六〇五年，卽煬帝大業元年，此與中國載籍</p>
<p>（隋書等）所記相同。但琉球正式成爲中國的屬</p>
<p>國，則由明代初葉開始。此後不但年年入貢，世</p>
<p>世來朝；並且遣送官生，執禮甚恭。官史暨私家</p>
<p>著述，屢有紀載，斑斑可考。明代自嘉靖以後，</p>
<p>國勢漸衰，邊政不修，西人勢力侵入南洋，日本</p>
<p>對於琉球，也生了覬覦之心；然琉球王室之對於</p>
<p>中國，固依舊修貢如故。卽我國使臣之前往琉球</p>
<p>者，亦踵相接。至淸代中葉，琉球始終承認中國</p>
<p>爲宗主國，自處藩屬，就是其後在日本壓迫之下</p>
<p>，琉球人堅強的意志，並不稍變其對於中國的忠</p>
<p>誠。我們祗要一讀琉人文獻，便可立見。量近琉</p>
<p>球革命同志會「駁斥日本的野心」，尤足徵明琉球</p>
<p>人民對日人如蘆田尾崎之荒謬絕倫，不恥所爲。</p>
<p>從地理位置言，琉球與台灣同爲中國之肩，</p>
<p>具有民族相依爲命的關係。琉球爲一羣島，延亙</p>
<p>於台灣及日本九州問，形成一大弧形，位於中國</p>
<p>東海之外緣，自東北而西南，蜿蜓海上凡八百浬</p>
<p>，計包括七十餘島，而積五千方公里，人口共八</p>
<p>十萬。以經緯度言，琉球位於北緯二十四度至三</p>
<p>十一度，東經一百二十四度至一百三十度之間，</p>
<p>各占七度之多。大琉球爲冲繩島，小琉球爲奄美</p>
<p>羣島之大島，均地位衝要·當淸光緒廿一年日本</p>
<p>佔領台灣後，對琉球更銳意經營，成爲南侵跳脚</p>
<p>石，足徵日本據琉球，完全是爲了侵略。現在意</p>
<p>圖爭取琉球，實仍含有不放棄侵略之野心。我們</p>
<p>尤其必須指出的：琉球羣島總面積不過五千方公</p>
<p>里，人口八十萬，其經濟價値，亦極有限；然美</p>
<p>日兩軍爭奪大琉球時，合計動員廿餘萬，激戰八</p>
<p>十三日，美第十軍軍長巴克納將軍死於此役，日</p>
<p>軍死傷十一萬五千人，死守至最後一人，神風自</p>
<p>殺飛機無力發揮之時，東京始宣佈投降。這一切</p>
<p>說明了琉球羣島在戰略上所具價値之重耍。</p>
<p>日本據琉球，爲了鞏固海上內衛防綫，美軍</p>
<p>控制琉球，爲了打開艦隊到達中國及黃海之路，</p>
<p>從而進抵中國及朝鮮。我國從中琉關係上，要求</p>
<p>琉球歸還中國，是爲了和平，保障台灣及中國領</p>
<p>海之安全。中國並無意以琉球作侵略的支撐點，</p>
<p>同時我國爲台灣及海上之和平計，並不願望琉球</p>
<p>成爲任何一國之軍略地帶。我國要扶助琉球的，</p>
<p>是琉球人的高度自治；我國耍發展琉球的，是琉</p>
<p>球人民得自中國的傳統文化能夠保持。琉球人的</p>
<p>血統和文化，與中國有千年來的關係；今天琉</p>
<p>球人民還祭祀孔子、居住生活，具有唐風，我們</p>
<p>不忍將民族的脈膊割斷。我們爲了未來的和平安</p>
<p>全，必須以保有琉球爲條件。我們抗戰，爲的是</p>
<p>民族生存；開羅波茨坦等文獻，並未拒絕中國保</p>
<p>有琉球，對於這一懸而待決的問題，我們在法理</p>
<p>上是應該力爭的。</p>
<p>今天，琉球人民和琉球革命同志會，已剴切</p>
<p>發出他們的呼聲：「北緯三十度以南至與那國島</p>
<p>，是琉球古代的領土，又是中國的一環，防衛大</p>
<p>陸的前哨」「今日際此琉球民族解放的好機會，</p>
<p>希望中國政府正視吾等同志的呼聲。」由於張院</p>
<p>長的表示，我國政府對琉球應卽歸還中國的這一</p>
<p>決定，必爲八十萬琉球人民所擁護。我們希望明</p>
<p>快的友邦，尊重大西洋憲章的精神，正視琉球民</p>
<p>族求解放的現實，贊助中琉人民的要求，使琉球</p>
<p>得以早日歸還中國。</p>

<p>又關於中國</p>
<p>政府是否考</p>
<p>慮在軍事區</p>

<p>據董氏答稱：政府雖在目前剿匪</p>
<p>作戰之際，亦未有施行新聞檢査</p>
<p>之意，故在總動員實施綱要中，</p>
<p>並無限制新聞自由之規定。復査</p>

<p>密通訉之自由，惟於憲法第二章</p>
<p>第二十三條中規定，爲避免緊急</p>
<p>危難維持社會秩序或增進公共利</p>
<p>益所必要者，應行除外。國民政</p>
<p>府於民國二十三年十一月二十九</p>

<p>規定，戰爭之際，某一地域猶受</p>

<p>長董顯光今日承認國防部已令戰</p>
<p>區軍事當局實行郵電檢査，新聞</p>
<p>電訉亦不能例外，惟聲明中國政</p>
<p>府無意恢復新聞檢查。關於聯合</p>
<p>社靑島電被扣留一事，謂已電靑</p>
<p>島警備司令部查詢。董氏並稱：</p>
<p>臨時地方性之郵電檢查不足以影</p>
<p>響報紙，外國記者發往國外之新</p>
<p>聞，旣不受統制，亦不受檢査，</p>
<p>此爲無可置議之事實。惟外國記</p>
<p>者多人咸請董氏注意此言與事實</p>
<p>不符。</p>
<h3>杜月笙歡迎詞原文</h3>
<p>（上接一版）杜氏致詞稱：「</p>
<p>亞蒙勳爵團長，各位貴賓，英國</p>
<p>議會代表團六位貴賓蒞　訪問，</p>
<p>中國政府及人民均表示熱列歡迎</p>
<p>。上海工商團體得於今日舉行招</p>
<p>待，實懷着無限的愉快和奮興。</p>
<p>中英兩國素具友誼，商業關係</p>
<p>尤有悠久歷史，第二次火戰中駢</p>
<p>肩作戰，患難相共，友誼更爲</p>
<p>實。戰後此種友誼繼續增長，英</p>
<p>國議會代表團此次來華訪問，具</p>
<p>徵英國友人關懷中國之深切，當</p>
<p>使中英兩國友誼今後更爲增進。</p>
<p>中英兩國在戰時同遭嚴軍打擊</p>
<p>，戰後感受經濟恐慌亦復相同，</p>
<p>爲求兩國經濟復興與繁榮，切實</p>
<p>合作實有必要。英國是工業國先</p>
<p>進國家，勝利以後力謀復興，戰</p>
<p>時所遺留的制度因爲配合復興的</p>
<p>需要，依然繼續執行，一面想盡</p>
<p>種種方法以期增加生產，大量輸</p>
<p>出。這是何等的　嚴而沉着，價</p>
<p>値得我們的借鏡。中國自勝利以</p>
<p>後，除一般的困難外，更因共產</p>
<p>黨之叛亂，各項建設益遭阻礙，</p>
<p>工商業之發展亦受鉅大之影響，</p>
<p>然吾人深信共產黨叛亂之必能敉</p>
<p>平，猶如對日抗戰之收獲勝利。</p>
<p>我國工商界從業人負，現正本政</p>
<p>府之指導輔助，努力奮鬥以渡此</p>
<p>困難時期。中英兩國間除了親善</p>
<p>和睦的友誼，歷久而彌覺顯著。</p>
<p>此外，我們更深切地感覺到世界</p>
<p>各國的經濟榮枯，具有不可分離</p>
<p>的連環性，甚望素稱工商業發達</p>
<p>之英國友人，能予吾人以援助。</p>
<p>亞蒙動爵於離英來華前夕所稱，</p>
<p>「英國國會和人民今日關心中國</p>
<p>的程度，一如戰時」，其誠懇的</p>
<p>態度，和熱烈的關切，足使中國</p>
<p>人民刻念不忘。</p>
<p>中國需要英國器材物資之輸入</p>
<p>者誠屬甚多，故在戰前巾國實爲</p>
<p>英國出口商之廣大市場。戰後巾</p>
<p>英間商務尙待間展，英國今後貿</p>
<p>易之發展、亦正賴中國之廣大市</p>
<p>場能迅速繁榮爲之先導。因此中</p>
<p>英兩國之切實合作，實爲必然趨</p>
<p>勢。</p>
<p>吾人於招待貴賓蒞臨之時，謹</p>
<p>代表工商界致歡迎之忱，尙祈各</p>
<p>一位貴賓多多指敎！」</p>

<h3>川島芳子處死刑</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕金璧輝到庭時上</p>
<p>身着擁至頸項之雪白毛衣，下身</p>
<p>着綠呢西服褲，外罩黑呢大衣，</p>
<p>穿黑皮鞋，頭髮仍作男式分梳，</p>
<p>光亮可鑒，而敷薄粉，狀頗愉快</p>
<p>。吳庭長訉明金身份後，即宣判</p>
<p>：「金璧輝通謀敵國，圖謀反抗</p>
<p>本國，處死刑，褫奪公　終身，</p>
<p>財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒</p>
<p>收。」吳氏繼解釋，此係根據徵</p>
<p>治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款</p>
<p>判決，並吿以如不服，可於十天</p>
<p>以內上訴。金聆判後，意態自若</p>
<p>，毫無恐懼神色，宣判畢，扭頭</p>
<p>即自動走返女監還押，並照當進</p>
<p>午餐，吃窩頭兩個，飯後即出臨</p>
<p>於女監僅二方尺餘之鐵絲網窗口</p>
<p>，與本報記者晤談，詢以是否準</p>
<p>備上訴，答俟與律師李宜琛商量</p>
<p>後再定。金表示對死生觀念極爲</p>
<p>淡，「反正早晚都要死」，「</p>
<p>壞活不如早死」，而且充份表現</p>
<p>着他的現實主義，「死，我不發</p>
<p>愁，只是發愁冬天監襄沒有爐子</p>
<p>，我又沒有衣服，冬天可怎麼過</p>
<p>」，金說自己「被寃屈了」，「就</p>
<p>是判我一天，我也感到寃屈，你</p>
<p>們淪陷期有在北平的，可以打聽</p>
<p>打聽，我作過什麼壞事」，他一</p>
<p>口推翻在十一戰區軍法處的口供</p>
<p>、說那是被騙簽字的，說自已被</p>
<p>捕吃虧在名氣太大，問他爲什麼</p>
<p>有那麼大的名氣，他聰明的回答</p>
<p>：你想一個亡國公主，生長流亡</p>
<p>異國，怎麼不惹人家害猜測呢，</p>
<p>在　獄兩年後，他還頑強的用繪</p>
<p>畫，寫字，喂　、來消磨這將近</p>
<p>結束的鐵窗歲刀。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕海外僑</p>
<p>胞之競選問題，頃巳由有關部會</p>
<p>擬定辦法，兩三日內即可公布，</p>
<p>惟據選總主席委員張厲生稱，該</p>
<p>項辦法尙待立院完成立法手續，</p>
<p>且其根本問題亦尙待下屆國大會</p>
<p>議時討論。外次葉公超廿二日在</p>
<p>記者招待會中，曾答覆記者之詢</p>
<p>間稱：「關於僑民在國外投票所</p>
<p>發生技術上之困難情事，選舉事</p>
<p>務機閣現正考虜適當辦法　卑吏</p>
<p>民意所歸之海外候選人，均能在</p>
<p>不影響居留國主權之情况下，得</p>
<p>以提名。」又關於通訊投票事，</p>
<p>曾與英國進行交涉，未獲結果。</p>
<p>因通訓頒發選票，均爲公民權之</p>
<p>行使。其次在公海艦上進行選舉</p>
<p>，復為我國海軍力量所不能及，</p>
<p>故如他國未經同意時，決不能勉</p>
<p>強，亦即如不獲同意，當應放</p>

<p>一事，頃經選總解釋，認爲在學</p>

<p>委任以上之文職，不得謂非立院</p>
<p>立委選罷法第十三條所稱之官吏</p>

<h3>世界女青年大會代表　莫絲母女的感慨　墨西哥婦女地位低落　本報杭州通信　特派記者洪絮才</h3>
<p>這次抵杭州出席世界</p>
<p>女靑年會代表大會的墨</p>
<p>西哥代表共有三人，除</p>
<p>當地會長安琪絲夫人外</p>
<p>，尙有莫絲母女二人，</p>
<p>漂亮活躍，頗受全塲注</p>
<p>意。莫絲太太看上去不</p>
<p>過三十餘歲，而女兒却</p>
<p>已長得婷婷玉立了。莫</p>
<p>親同來，成爲大會中最年輕美麗的代</p>
<p>表。</p>
<p>她們都是第一次來到中國，對杭州</p>
<p>的印象是：和平，美麗，文雅，淸秀</p>
<p>。莫絲小姐因爲大會節日緊張，剝奪</p>
<p>了她遊西湖的時間，抱怨萬分，她說</p>
<p>：「汽車駛在湖旁，我眞恨不得跳下</p>
<p>去呀！」</p>
<p>莫絲母女二人都健談，對記者歷述</p>
<p>墨國風土人情的時候，大家指手劃脚</p>
<p>，滔滔不絕。</p>
<p>她們描摹下的墨西哥是環境幽美，</p>
<p>氣候良好，世界大戰也沒有使他們受</p>
<p>到致命的打擊，美國給他們的影響很</p>
<p>大，人民處處模仿美國，這傾向在戰</p>
<p>後更形顯著，墨西哥人愛唱歌，喜跳</p>
<p>舞，尙亨樂，生活輕鬆浪漫，然而，</p>
<p>婦女的地位却低落得可憐。</p>
<p>墨西哥的婚姻法律中，有一條明文</p>
<p>規定：凡丈夫發現妻子有不貞行爲時</p>
<p>，當塲可加殺戮，只要能提供具體證</p>
<p>據。因此妻十都奉守婦道，誰都不敢</p>
<p>和自己生命開玩笑。</p>
<p>那麼，那些丈夫呢？雖然法律規定</p>
<p>，每個男子只准娶一個妻子，然而願</p>
<p>意遵守的鮮如鳳毛麟角，多數丈夫，</p>
<p>皆不能以一個妻子爲滿足，除了家裏</p>
<p>放一個名正的髮妻外，外面的情婦或</p>
<p>多或少總是難免的，此風一長，簡直</p>
<p>就成為墨西哥男子默許的權利了，情</p>
<p>形之普遍，較之中國，唯過之而無</p>
<p>不及。</p>
<p>允許這種不合理現象存在的基本原</p>
<p>因，還在於女子地位之低落，社會上</p>
<p>處處歧視女子，使女子多無法自立，</p>
<p>離開丈夫，生活頓成間題，因此一切</p>
<p>只好逆來順受。而且因爲墨西哥男權</p>
<p>囂張，探偶容易，男子都不願意娶離</p>
<p>婚的女人，再加以該地離婚手續特別</p>
<p>難，所以妻子大多隱忍，而鮮有請求</p>
<p>離異的。</p>
<p>墨西哥貧富階級縣殊，這在婚禮儀</p>
<p>式上可充分表現。那裏人民多信奉天</p>
<p>主敎，婚禮皆在敎堂舉行，富有階級</p>
<p>，每每極盡豪華，隆重的儀式和禮節</p>
<p>，奢侈的晚餐和酒會，一夜千金，在</p>
<p>所不惜。而那些貧窮的，便只有最簡</p>
<p>陋的點心。墨西哥婚禮的表現是：不</p>
<p>是豪富，便是赤貧，從未有介乎兩者</p>
<p>之間的。</p>
<p>他們婚禮有特異的習俗是：一切晚</p>
<p>餐和酒會的耗費，全由女家負担，同</p>
<p>時新娘在結婚之前，要先舉行茶會，</p>
<p>向她親近的女友吿別，被邀的只是女</p>
<p>友，男子不准參加，這些女友赴會的</p>
<p>時候，每人必帶禮物一件，濫此禮物</p>
<p>多事先剖定範圍，譬如說，決定的是</p>
<p>廚房，大家便置備廚房中用的各種器</p>
<p>皿，到吿別會的那天，便搬來整套廚</p>
<p>房用具。</p>
<p>凡家境比較富裕的婦女，在結婚以</p>
<p>後，便不願出外任職，這也是女子職</p>
<p>業所以不能發達的原因之一。職業婦</p>
<p>女，大多總是未婚的，所担任的工作</p>
<p>，不外乎打字員，女秘書等職，更大</p>
<p>多數是做工的，不但婦女的職位低落</p>
<p>，而且待遇不平，同樣的工作，男女</p>
<p>報酬之差額極大。</p>
<p>假如要把墨西哥婦女歸納起來，大</p>
<p>體上可以分成三類：貴婦人，農婦，</p>
<p>和勞工。墨西哥是農業國，鄕村婦女</p>
<p>都須下田操作，和中國的農婦一樣，</p>
<p>除幫助丈夫種田外，還須管家和兼領</p>
<p>孩子，職務較男子更艱難繁重。此外</p>
<p>，城市中在生活綫上掙扎的勞工，因</p>
<p>男女的不平等，受到比男子更重一層</p>
<p>的剝削。就說是那些貴婦人吧，坐在</p>
<p>家裏亨福，好像不壞，但是說穿了，</p>
<p>還不是男人的附屬品，她得戰戰兢兢</p>
<p>，隨時提防被丈夫遺棄。</p>
<p>莫絲母女是墨西哥女靑年會代表，</p>
<p>她們對國內婦女情形自然瞭解得比較</p>
<p>深刻，提起婦女在政治，社會，職業</p>
<p>，婚姻，敎育各方面都沒有平等，國</p>
<p>內姊妹如何在苦難中熬煎的時候，莫</p>
<p>絲太太唯有搖首長嘆，而這位二十來</p>
<p>歲的莫絲小姐，則對記者咬牙切齒的</p>
<p>說：「我眞恨這些男人呀」！</p>

<h3>英議辯論開始　艾登抨擊政府妥協外交　並責蘇聯稽遲德國復興</h3>
<p>［路透社倫敦廿一日電］保守黨副領袖艾登於下院就政府之計劃舉行一般辯論時，謂政府之</p>
<p>計劃削减上議院權力，爲純粹黨派的政策，不能恢復國家之　榮或人民之幸福。艾登並曰政府</p>
<p>將國內艦隊减爲巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦四艘，竟使英艦隊校秘魯海軍猶小，此項局勢，引起國人</p>
<p>之嚴重關切。述及國際局勢時，艾登謂自議會於八月間休假以來，國際屆勢每况愈下，聯合國</p>
<p>機構殊不能有所建樹。就歐洲方面言，則有新共產國際之產生產共，對當對義兩國社會黨之加緊</p>
<p>活動，及保反對黨領袖貝特柯夫之被害。英國今應堅持其眞正民主及自由生活之信念，在國際</p>
<p>協定之義務下，履行其責任。僅事與他人妥協，決不能有所成就。艾登並曰：史達林最近接見</p>
<p>若干工黨議員時所述及之友誼，在莫斯科電台繼續對蘇聯之盟邦猛烈抨擊之際，殊難令人接受</p>
<p>。述及德國問題時’艾登調德國迄尙不能獲得經濟統一之待遇，此非英國政府之過，而由於蘇</p>
<p>聯之行動。英國已在其德境佔領區內，根據與歐洲未來和平最材利之原則，進行其工作。德國</p>
<p>對於本國之經濟復興，應從事最大之貢獻，同時德國亦決不能重整武裝，成爲對於和平的威脅</p>
<p>。艾登於述及英國之出售黃金準備金時，認爲乃極度嚴重之事件。艾登認歐洲十六國對馬　爾</p>
<p>計劃之反應，爲今年八月以來國際上最重大之事件，希望今後當能依照此一計劃，謀取發展，</p>
<p>使西歐經濟之復興，得以實現。但渠又日：「若僅事憑藉他人之援助，乃一嚴重之錯誤，吾人</p>
<p>必須本身從事全力努力，吾人必須面臨極度困難之局勢。」</p>
<p>艾德禮首相繼艾登之發言發宣布政府擬使上議院得以阻延立法案之期限自兩年减爲一年。</p>
<p>當艾德禮稱此一措施乃明智的預防措施時，反對黨領袖邱吉爾即加以駁斥，稱之爲故意的社會</p>
<p>侵略行爲。艾德禮繼曰：上議院如果無意使用其威脅性的權力，以阻撓民選下議院之決議，則</p>
<p>政府之建議削减上院權力，常與上院無損。</p>
<h3>國際局勢險惡英相深表不安</h3>
<p>艾德禮繼述及外交問題，對外交之緊張局勢及蘇聯在聯合</p>
<p>國機構中之態度深表不安，關於日內瓦之貿易談判，雖多困</p>
<p>難，但相信與會之十七國大部份當能成立協定。述及帝國貿</p>
<p>易優惠制時，艾德禮聲明，英國並無建立帝國優惠制整個制</p>
<p>度之意，英國始終不忘與西半球保特平衡的經濟關係，今已</p>
<p>得爲英國及其殖民帝國之生產品獲得市塲之出口，常能使英</p>
<p>鎊區增加美元之收入。艾德禮繼述及軍隊問題，謂在今後十</p>
<p>八個月內，軍隊將大事裁减，至於國內艦隊之削减，則完全</p>
<p>係暫時性質，軍隊人員至明年三月，常减爲總數九十三萬七</p>
<p>千人，較原定計劃再减五十五萬人。艾德禮承認自八月間國</p>
<p>會休假以來，經濟局勢日劣，其詳細情形常由克里浦斯及道</p>
<p>爾頓等在一兩日內宣布。最後渠表示必先整頓內部，渡過艱</p>
<p>難時期。</p>

<p>美洲銀行，以樹立西半球貿易；</p>
<p>貝氏則謂美國商人惟有投資于拉</p>
<p>丁美洲之工業化，方可獲得取償</p>
<p>。據霍氏宣稱，美國正常輸出，</p>
<p>現在漸見减少，非因各國不願購</p>
<p>買美貨，祗因缺乏美元付款。霍</p>

<p>辦，主要目的在鼓起兒童興趣，</p>
<p>啓發其愛羣愛社會之心理。留營</p>

<h3>袁希洛感情衝動跪求補助實山縣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日開會</p>
<p>討論莘莊及諸翟之轄屬</p>
<p>及新劃八市區之大塲貼</p>
<p>補等問題時，列席有關之市縣參議員，區長，民衆代表等唇槍舌</p>
<p>劍，激辯不休。寳山縣參議會議長袁希洛年逾古稀，亦參加辯論</p>
<p>，認爲當此原子世界，都市不宜集中，而須分設，免在戰爭時犧</p>
<p>牲過鉅。現上海人口已近五百萬人，故亟應疏散，斷不可再事擴</p>
<p>張。大塲爲寳山縣之精華，今被劃入市府，影饗稅收財政甚大，</p>
<p>故請市府援照民國十七年舊例十以補貼，袁議長爲地方人民爭利</p>
<p>，情感衝動，竟至下跪於主席祝平之前，唏噓申述上海市與寳山</p>
<p>縣猶如兄弟，今兄已發達，大塲區又被劃入市府，故對貧瘠之弟</p>
<p>，請予補助，經旁坐衆人攙扶始起。但上海市財政局長田永謙對</p>
<p>該一新劃人市區地帶縣方要求貼補問題，始終堅持反對。認爲院</p>
<p>令並未規定此點，且上海市財政自給自足，時感拮据，再欲每年</p>
<p>貼補縣方，實無此能力。經討論再三，終商定對江蘇省代表之此</p>
<p>點要求，候呈行政院核示。</p>

<h3>南天一角　海南島的呼聲</h3>
<p>﹝本報海南島十八日航訊﹞</p>
<p>正當北地菊開，梧桐葉落，西</p>
<p>風雁去，禾榖登塲的季節，這</p>
<p>僻處南天一角的海南島卻仍然</p>
<p>是四野蔥綠，風光旖旎，還沒</p>
<p>有一點兒寒冷的氣息。在街上</p>
<p>，健碩的女人們依然是袒胸露</p>
<p>臂，田野間，黝黑而健康的農</p>
<p>夫還赤着膊，流着汗，揮動着</p>
<p>他們的鋤頭，鋤掘着他們的希</p>
<p>望。正是風和日麗，海南島還</p>
<p>呼吸着「春天的氣息」。</p>
<p>只聞樓梯聲</p>
<p>海南島</p>
<p>改設特別</p>
<p>行政區，一年前便在醞釀，到</p>
<p>本年七月間，穗行轅主任張向</p>
<p>華上將携帶改制計劃晋京，算</p>
<p>是達到了最高潮。可是，因爲</p>
<p>軍力，財力等問題不能獲便解</p>
<p>決，改制的呼聲取隨着張上將</p>
<p>的飛台返穗，而吿消沉。海南</p>
<p>的民衆，不僅渴望改省，而且</p>
<p>渴望實現，但都只聞樓梯響，</p>
<p>失望到了色點。</p>
<p>八月，力主海南改制的國</p>
<p>府顧問陳籌碩海軍中將，穗行</p>
<p>轅新聞處長黃珍吾中將，會先</p>
<p>後返回海口。他們兩位都是海</p>
<p>南的聞人，海南的民衆曾舉行</p>
<p>歡迎大會，徵詢改制的意見。</p>
<p>當時，他們兩位答覆的語氣，</p>
<p>肯切而堅定，表示改制的實現</p>
<p>，是短期內的事。隨着，幾家</p>
<p>報紙便傳出了種種關於改制的</p>
<p>消息，並且刋載了特別行政長</p>
<p>官公署的各處室人選名單，空</p>
<p>氣極爲緊張。這時，恰巧京滬</p>
<p>記者團來海南島訪問，海口市</p>
<p>的報紙，一致以社論　請記者</p>
<p>團協助，敦促政府實現改制，</p>
<p>密鑼緊鼓，像煞有介事。可是</p>
<p>不久，又傳出張向華上將表示</p>
<p>不就特別行政長官，改制問題</p>
<p>開始走向了下坡路。</p>
<p>改制仍落空</p>
<p>九月底</p>
<p>，宋子文</p>
<p>主粤消息傳出後，一般人對改</p>
<p>制的實現又重新燃起了希望的</p>
<p>火炬。因爲宋氏是海南島的文</p>
<p>昌縣人，戰前，他對海南島的</p>
<p>建設便很有興趣，曾經計劃建</p>
<p>築環島鐵路。如果不是日本人</p>
<p>掀起戰爭，相信這計劃便已老</p>
<p>早完成了。</p>
<p>但是，事情是出人意料之外</p>
<p>，宋子文接事後，聽說他對改</p>
<p>制認爲並無必要。他並於十月</p>
<p>十三日在穗邀請海南聞人座談</p>
<p>鄕政，結果是大家都認爲改制</p>
<p>可以暫緩，另設綏靖區，綏靖</p>
<p>主任一職，則屬意於陳籌碩或</p>
<p>韓漢英，加強海南島的剿匪力</p>
<p>量。在經濟方面，宋子文擬在</p>
<p>海南島設實業警辦公署，督辦</p>
<p>一職，擬派私人秘畫陸文瀾出</p>
<p>任，主持實業的開發。這一來</p>
<p>，宋子文主粵將加速海南島實</p>
<p>現改制的希望，又落空了。</p>
<p>海疆一據點</p>
<p>本來，</p>
<p>海南島和</p>
<p>台灣雀同是我國海疆的軍要據</p>
<p>點。靠着台灣五十年的經營，</p>
<p>日本人曾因此而充實其國內的</p>
<p>經濟，靠着海南島的七年多的</p>
<p>開發，亦建立他南進的根據地</p>
<p>。今天的海南島還是瘡痍滿目</p>
<p>，可以說還是由於得不到繼續</p>
<p>的開發和繼續的建設，以致文</p>
<p>化落後，民情複雜，交通阻塞</p>
<p>，治安不良，似將成爲了國家</p>
<p>的累贅，是很可使人悲歎的。</p>
<p>假使希望抹去這些悲歎的情緒</p>
<p>，使海南島轉爲有用於國家，</p>
<p>把它從速扶植起來，是不容忽</p>
<p>視的。（陳梅靑寄自海口市）</p>

<h3>南湖船　南湖菱　南湖蟹　嘉興喜獲鉅額投資</h3>
<p>﹝本報杭州廿一日訊﹞今年杭州的</p>
<p>遊客特別多，由上海，杭州到嘉興去</p>
<p>的遊客也特別多，而且據嘉興當地的</p>
<p>老百姓說，盛况竟是空前的。自從春</p>
<p>夏一直到秋已深深的今天，遊客還是</p>
<p>絡繹不絕。嘉興可以玩的地方爲烟雨</p>
<p>樓。</p>
<p>烟雨樓</p>
<p>在鴛鴦湖(一名南湖</p>
<p>)的中央，因為嘉興</p>
<p>地處平原，所以南湖一到夏天的時候</p>
<p>，凉風習習，吹透心胸。南湖上有一</p>
<p>種小船，用篾蓆做棚，後梢搖櫓，載</p>
<p>客去遊烟雨樓，別饒風趣，據說這許</p>
<p>多船是由許家浜開出來的。許家浜村</p>
<p>上的人，生男則種田，生女則搖船，</p>
<p>南湖船娘，因以名動於京滬綫上。現</p>
<p>在這些南湖船中，陳設着一張凉床，</p>
<p>綢面的被頭，還放着兩個　着鴛鴦的</p>
<p>枕頭，小小的半桌倚在船棚邊，置着</p>
<p>一些茶杯之類，如果一二個遊客，便</p>
<p>可呌船放到湖中菱繞竹的旁邊，繫了</p>
<p>綫索，讓船娘剝一些鮮菱，或是弄幾</p>
<p>隻湖蟹，燙幾斤花雕，在船中與女孩</p>
<p>子對酌。好的船娘的船，大概每小時</p>
<p>要兩萬元光景。老太婆的船也要五六</p>
<p>千元一小時。這些搖船的女孩子們，</p>
<p>却不諳游泳，但膽子很大，船在搖擺</p>
<p>不定的時候，她一些也不慌張。曾問</p>
<p>他們爲什麼不學游泳，她們說：「姑</p>
<p>娘家不好出身露體在湖裏游泳的。」</p>
<p>南湖菱</p>
<p>行銷京滬杭一帶，菱</p>
<p>大無角，味美質嫩，</p>
<p>嚐過南湖菱沒有一個不愛它。相傳</p>
<p>乾隆皇帝到南湖烟雨樓，吃菱時覺味</p>
<p>甚芙，無意間慨嘆菱有雙角，以後南</p>
<p>湖菱就沒有角了。這個故事現在想來</p>
<p>，眞太可笑了。菱的產地在南湖四週</p>
<p>，產的時間爲夏初至冬初，菱分嫩，</p>
<p>老，最老三種，嫩可生吃，老可煮熟</p>
<p>吃，最老可風乾後吃，味均可口異常</p>
<p>。記者曾問一個船家今年的菱訊，她</p>
<p>說她家有菱塘十畝，兩個月來已賺得</p>
<p>了一二千萬元，今年菱的生意不錯。</p>
<p>在市上賣二千元一斤，如果你會讓價</p>
<p>的話，可買一千元一斤。約略算來至</p>
<p>少也有將近十億的收入，這筆收入就</p>
<p>投資在嘉興的市塲上了。另一名產爲</p>
<p>南湖蟹</p>
<p>蟹分　解與卵蟹，</p>
<p>蟹產於嘉興附近卅里</p>
<p>以內者爲佳，味鮮，肉實，個子大，</p>
<p>九月雌蟹爲佳，十月雄蟹爲佳。所謂</p>
<p>者，就是用小竹枝編成竹　形，阻</p>
<p>於河道中，蟹游過時游入迷陣，遂被</p>
<p>捕獲，河道中如水流湍急，則其蟹個</p>
<p>子愈大，味亦愈鮮，肉也愈爲結實。</p>
<p>嘉興新勝西北的思古橋所產的最為名</p>
<p>貴，不過產量每日只有二担，求過於</p>
<p>供，其他運河流域或其支流如嘉興附</p>
<p>近之次渠小川，均有斷有蟹。其中產</p>
<p>於南湖的，個子碩大無比，所以各爲</p>
<p>南湖大蟹。產於嘉興附近的蟹，每天</p>
<p>約可五十担，每担二百萬元。</p>
<p>柳蟹則產於嘉善附近，尤以嘉善西</p>
<p>塘爲最多。日產一百餘担，價一百四</p>
<p>十萬元。</p>
<p>嘉興蟹</p>
<p>約二百萬元一担，當</p>
<p>不批價，惟日產五十</p>
<p>担，已爲一萬萬元，再加水脚等售與</p>
<p>顧客時，當在四五萬万元以上。現在</p>
<p>，嘉興最上鲜蟹賣三千元一兩，次之</p>
<p>二千八百元一兩，再次爲二千元一兩</p>
<p>。上海市價最高有五千元一兩者，最</p>
<p>低爲三千元一兩者。</p>
<p>蟹最好的時節，是在　陽風起以後</p>
<p>，重陽以後，菊花慢慢的開了，正是</p>
<p>詩人雅客們持鏊賞菊的時候。</p>
<p>當然南湖船，南湖菱，南湖蟹，都</p>
<p>是屬於享受與消費的，但是在這南湖</p>
<p>船，南湖菱，南湖蟹產地的嘉興，倒</p>
<p>是歡迎許多消費者來投資的。像今年</p>
<p>這樣的熱鬧，這樣多的遊客，起碼也</p>
<p>有將近百億的收入，所以嘉興的市面</p>
<p>又復甦活起來。我們願嘉興人好好利</p>
<p>用道一筆資金，多做些復興地方的建</p>
<p>設事業。(特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>北方各院校　煤費問題解决　平津先向四聯處借支　東北由行轅就近貸款　西北貸款正在進行中</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京二十二日電﹞敎部對北方院校，本有冬</p>
<p>季煤費之撥濟，今年冬季北方專科以上學校需用煤斤數量之費，</p>
<p>業由敎部呈請行政院核撥中，惟北方天氣早寒，俟政院核准全案</p>
<p>及撥發款項，緩不濟急，且物價逐月飛漲，勢須提前籌措。前次</p>
<p>蔣主席與行政院張院長先後視察平津時，平津各院校當局，當面</p>
<p>請，並將學校員生人數及需要</p>
<p>煤斤數量，造報預算呈明。張院</p>
<p>長常時手論對平津專科以上學校</p>
<p>冬季煤費，即速辦理，因此敎部</p>
<p>先向四聯總處担保借支七十二億</p>
<p>元，爲平津兩地專科以上學校煤</p>
<p>費之用，俟政院核准全案撥發煤</p>
<p>費時，再行扣還。聞北平由北大</p>

<p>專科以上學校商議辦法，最近已</p>
<p>由張伯苓將會商結果及指定貸款</p>
<p>銀行，呈報敎部辦理。此外東北</p>
<p>方面之專科以上學校冬季煤費需</p>
<p>款之事，請由東北行轅就近酌量</p>
<p>各校情形。先爲貸款，以濟急需</p>
<p>。又西北各校（包括邊疆）冬季</p>
<p>煤費貸款，亦正在由敎部向四聯</p>
<p>銀行接洽進行中。</p>

<h3>香島足球大戰　傑志大勝星島　遠征歸來道次露臉七比二遭空前慘敗</h3>
<p>﹝本報香港航訊﹞轉眼</p>
<p>又是週末，足球聯賽單是</p>
<p>週六，便有四塲，球事紛</p>
<p>紜，看球人目不暇給，我</p>
<p>們先看了今日的戰果，再</p>
<p>看明天的星傑大戰。</p>
<p>南華會　渡海克敵</p>
<p>十八日</p>
<p>星期六</p>
<p>，華軍</p>
<p>出戰的兩隊，都奏凱歌還</p>
<p>，巴士在海軍塲以四比一</p>
<p>打倒海軍，球雖然贏了，</p>
<p>但巴士踢得不夠勁。勝的</p>
<p>原因是海軍實力太低，我</p>
<p>想，今年巴士雖擁有相當</p>
<p>實力，却必然鬱鬱不得志</p>
<p>。南華渡海征雙察球塲，</p>
<p>警察列陣迎敵，結果陳德</p>
<p>輝獨建三功，凈勝警察三</p>
<p>球，中落的南華，漸有生</p>
<p>氣了。兩幕洋兵內戰，迪雲勝空軍是四比一，聖約瑟也以三比一贏香港會。</p>
<p>東方會　竟和光華</p>
<p>十九日星期日，星傑大戰，吸盡球迷，其他</p>
<p>兩戰，便變成了冷門。東方今年銳志整頓陣</p>
<p>勢，最近又拉得朱永強効力，誰料今日竟被</p>
<p>華隊最弱之光華打和，前後失去五分，雖有奪標之心，奈大</p>
<p>勢難挽了。球賽在兩個十二碼球內決定大局，各得一個，一</p>
<p>對一和。一幕洋兵打鬥，燕尼斯以五比二勝砲兵。</p>
<p>銅鑼灣　球迷滿座</p>
<p>最惹人注目的</p>
<p>星傑大戰，在</p>
<p>銅鑼灣海軍塲</p>
<p>舉仃，球迷湧至，四時半已經關</p>
<p>鬥滿座。星島遠征球員、今年分</p>
<p>在星島傑志効力，傑志現以全勝</p>
<p>姿態在領導聯賽羣雄，星島又是</p>
<p>征英回港後的第一戰，滿以爲必</p>
<p>有劇鬥、孰料戰來一面倒，星島</p>
<p>竟以七比二慘敗。笛聲起處，但</p>
<p>見雙方陣容排出：</p>
<p>【傑志】</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>曾仲雲　侯　生</p>
<p>劉松生　宋靈星　劉慶村</p>
<p>景　　黎兆榮　郭英祺　何應芬　鄧廣森</p>
<p>【星島】</p>
<p>余　德</p>
<p>劉天申　鄭英</p>
<p>單友生　許竟成　李殿</p>
<p>曹秋亭　馮景祥　　煥章　張金　　黎仲賢</p>
<p>星島隊　失策失常</p>
<p>一看陣勢，星</p>
<p>島用殿祺，方</p>
<p>生作中衛，錯</p>
<p>排了陣，遂知其必敗無疑，加以</p>
<p>全隊失常，鄭英權又在一開賽便</p>
<p>受傷，使不穩的後防更　了，敗</p>
<p>是「失常」「失策」的後果。</p>
<p>由於星島踢出未見理想，當然</p>
<p>得傑志好，由衛綫及時出擊。</p>
<p>迫使星島在　打，是穩定勝利最</p>
<p>有力的一環，而兆榮的射門，勁</p>
<p>而刁，確使門將　寒。</p>
<p>下半時　一敗涂地</p>
<p>再戰、星島</p>
<p>傑志站脚未穩</p>
<p>，　煥章先湧</p>
<p>一球，再戰使見英　受傷，傑志</p>
<p>乘時反擊，廣森遠射成功，扳成</p>
<p>一比一。此時，星島全綫退守，</p>
<p>傑志攻雖多，只在蔡區內盤旋，</p>
<p>最後，煥章得景祥妙傳，可惜挑</p>
<p>射成野球，前半時成了和局。</p>
<p>再戰，甫開賽，自兆榮運射兩</p>
<p>球後，應芬又頂入一隻，八分鐘</p>
<p>間星島連失三球，傑志瞬以四比</p>
<p>一前導，斯時傑志完全控制局面</p>
<p>，跟着英祺又射入，五比一，天</p>
<p>下大勢已定，始見金海偶得衝門</p>
<p>機會建功，成五比二。再過，應</p>
<p>芬扣門，英祺廿碼外射罰球，都</p>
<p>吿得手，成七比二完場，全戰了</p>
<p>無精彩，只見射門。</p>

<h3>棉紗聯合配銷　綱要昨已商定　劉主委携京提經委會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕</p>
<p>紡調會於昨日</p>
<p>下午四時，召</p>
<p>開棉紗聯合配</p>
<p>銷辦法審查會</p>
<p>議，出席審查</p>
<p>委員臭味經，蔣迪先，王啓宇，唐星海，六區棉紡公會代表</p>
<p>劉丕　，韓志明，邵寶虎，張文魁，袁國樑，朱扶九等，亦</p>
<p>列席，由劉泗英主席。先由各列席代表分別報告民營廠對聯</p>
<p>合配銷辦法之意見，迄七時許始畢，各列席代表先退。繼即</p>
<p>開始討論，決議五點：　通鍋棉紗聯合配銷辦法網要。　該</p>
<p>項聯合配銷辦法，係屬全國性，惟先自上海區試辦。　紡調</p>
<p>會原有之成品運銷小紙會，改設棉紗聯合配銷委員會。　國</p>
<p>民營紗廠產紗，概憑紡調會證件配紗。　配銷委會每月將視</p>
<p>各地棉紗需要，及其存底實銷情形，造一配額預算表，以憑</p>
<p>配銷。至通過之配銷辦法網耍，已由該會主委劉泗英，於昨</p>
<p>夜携京，將提出於今日全國經委會席上討論。</p>
<p>聞棉紗聯合配銷辦法內容共九條，主要綱領：　組織棉紗</p>
<p>聯合配銷委員會，凡與紗布有關之各機關法團，均將聘爲委</p>
<p>員。　所有國民營紗廠產紗，均須憑配銷會證件酊售。　配</p>
<p>銷暫以棉紗爲限，配售優先對象，以複製業佔首，紗商次之</p>
<p>據紡調會某負責人談：棉紗聯合配銷辦法，爲政府旣定決</p>
<p>策，勢在必行。惟政府決推行合理之配銷政策，絕不委曲各</p>
<p>廠之生產，對棉紗議價，尤以　到廠商合法利潤爲前提。是</p>
<p>以在施行之前，先事徴取民營廠之意見，蓋證明當局決意在</p>
<p>求配銷辦法之合理化云。</p>

<h3>新美學</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>蔡儀著　羣益出版社刊行</p>
<p>讓過了著者的「新藝術論」，就應該　他的這本是新美學」，因之，我介紹了「新藝術論」，也得要介紹這本「新美學」。</p>
<p>從書名上看，就知道它是和舊美學對立的。因爲，舊美學已完全暴露了它的矛盾，所以不得不以新的方法建立新的美學體系。</p>
<p>什麼是舊美學？他在美學的方法論中指出：第一是形而上學的美學派，是完全由意識的自我反省去把握美的本質。邦格騰(Baumgarten)，康德(Kant），克魯齊(Croce），以至於茀徐納(Fechner）的主張由感覺去把握的本質，和柏拉圖（Plato）的主張由觀念去把握美的本質，柯恩（Colm），叔本華（Schopenhauer）的主張由感情去把握美的本質，都屬此類。第二是心理學的美學派，在美學方法上是和形而上學的美學相反的，不是從形而上學的哲學思想出發，而是從心理學的經驗出發，一方面排斥主觀意識的思辨的反省方法，而採用寳驗的方法；另一方面所考察的對象還是主觀意識的活動，並以主觀意識爲基準而規定的現象，它也分着：純粹心理學的美學派，偏於美感的意識活動的考察；實驗芙學派，偏於美的現象的考察。第三是客觀的美學，是從藝術來考察美，泰納（Taine），赫德爾(Herder），居友（Guyau）主張從社會硏究藝術的基本形式，格羅塞（Grosse)主張以人種學的立塲來硏究藝術；阿林(Allan)，斯賓塞（Spencer），格羅斯(Cross）主張以進化論的立場偏重個人的藝術衝動的考察。</p>
<p>這本「新美學」就在：「由主觀意識去考察美，或者只由藝術去考察美，但是藝術的美是憑籍主觀意識所創造的，而主觀意識的美感又是客觀存在的美的反應，所以結果都是失敗了。」(一六頁）的批判之下，指出新美學的途徑是：「美在於客觀的現實事物，現實事物的美是美感的根源，也是藝術美的根源，因此正確的美學的途徑是由現實事物去考察美，去把握美的本質。」（一七頁）</p>
<p>美學的全領域可分爲三方面：一，美的存在—客觀的美，二，美的認識—美惑，三，美的創造—藝術。而美的存在是最基礎的東西，而舊美學中，往往以美感與美混雜不淸，於是便發現了很多的矛盾。著者對「主觀的美」論者如茀徐納，里蒲士(Lipps），康德，克羅齊，以及吾國以著「文藝心理學」馳　的朱光潛，和客觀觀念論美學者等的矛盾，予以嚴正的批判，而確立了：「美是客觀的，不是主觀的；美的事物之所以美，是在於這事物本身，不在於我們的意識作用。但是客觀的美是可以爲我們的意識所反映，是可以引起我們的美感。而正確的美感的根源正是在於客觀事物的美。沒有客觀的美爲根據而發生的美感是不正確的，是虛僞的，乃至是病態的。………美的東西就是典型的東西，就是個別之中顯現着一般的柬西；美的本質就是事物的典型性，就是個別之中顯現着種類的一般。」(六八頁）</p>
<p>關於美的認識，即美感的一問題，著者把舊有的理論如：形效的直覺說，心理距離說，美感態度說，感情移入說，內模說與共他生理學的美學等作一檢討，指出芙的認識的正確過程與其特性，美感的性質與根源。著者認定；「美感原是變化的，　相對的斷續性便是芙感的變化的一個主要契機。」(一七○頁）</p>
<p>「美是客觀的，但可以爲我們的意識所反映。所謂美的事物，就是種類的屬性條件較之個別的屬性條件是優勢的事物，也就是「個別裏顯現一般」的與型。」（一七一頁）這便是著者對於美的基本規定，從這樣的規定來區別美的種類，分爲單象美，個體美，給合美，所謂單象美，是旨形豈，音響，顏色，氣和味，溫度和硬度等的美，過去形式主養的美學家非常重視它，並爲爲單象美便是美的一切。個體芙是須具它應有的單象芙，但並不是　象美的集合，同時：個體美不是僞於形式的，也不是偏於內容的，而是內容和形式恰好的配合，它引起的美感頗強，但不是超快感的，現實主義的藝術家極注意到它。綜合美是個體的必然的相互關聯，是種類的一般的屬性條件愈是優勢的是愈美，過去理想主義的美學家極注意它，並以綜合美便是美的一切。</p>
<p>同時，芙的種類，又有其第二種的分類法，即自然美，社會美與藝術美，自然美是非人爲的，和人的美的認識無關係的；社會美是人爲的，和人的美的認識無關係的；藝術芙是人爲的，根據人的美而產生的。因之：藝術芙較之自然美或社會美，一般地說是高級的。</p>
<p>美旣有如此的種類，而美感的種類，自然也有其不同。當芙的對象和美的觀念結合時，，面發生芙感，同時發生感性，智性及感情的種種伴隨的條件，反過來說：由這些伴隨的條件面致有種種不同的美感。這便是芙感形式的不同，可以分爲雄偉的美感和秀婉的美感，與悲劇的美感和笑劇的美感二組。就心理上說：雄偉的美感是矛盾的混合情緒活動，秀婉的美感就是調和的混合情緒活動。悲劇的美感是由雄偉擴充出來的，因美的對象的刺激強大，而引起逆受的精神反應，不僅是朦朧的心情緊張興奮，而是鮮明的悲哀。同樣，笑劇的美感是由秀婉擴充起來的，因美的對象的刺激更柔和，引起伴隨着朦朧的精神反應的美感。</p>
<p>藝術是美的創造，而美既有如此的分類，藝術當然也可以如</p>
<p>從來的美學家和藝術理論家，對藝術的分類有三：一，時間和空間的分類；二，　的和動的分類；三，造形的和音樂的，這種分類方法，表面看來，尙屬可行，但都沒一觸藝術的本質。因爲藝術的本質是：「藝術的本質是什麼呢？我們知道就是藝術的美，也就是藝術所反映的現實的美，現實的典型。現實的美的根源，現實的典型性，經藝術家的強化而創造爲藝術的美。」(二四九頁）於是藝術的種類應該就是根據藝術所反映的客觀事物的美的種類來分，便是單象美的藝術，即指音樂，建築，跳舞，圖案等，是偏於形式的；個體美的藝術，即指繪畫，彫刻，是偏於形式和內容的調和一致；綜合美的藝術是文學，戲劇，綜合美就</p>
<p>一般性質來說是高於個體美的，而社會美也就是綜合美哩。</p>
<h3>介紹「理化用高等算學」</h3>
<p>— 李宗海</p>
<p>商務印書館卅六年五月初版</p>
<p>譯述者　徐燮均</p>
<p>原著　J.W.Mellor</p>
<p>高等算學是研究自然科學必要的工具。自然界物體的性質都是在連續不斷的變化，只有靠了高等數學的法則才能研究這種永遠流動不居的現象。例如，微分法可以推究自然現象怎樣的刻刻在變化，以極限比巧妙地來表示任何均勻而連續的變化在片刻間的變化率。積分法可以從己知自然變化在片刻間的性質，而求支配全部變化過程的定律。無限級數供給自然變化一個近似觀念，以濟其他方法之窮。解析幾何能以幾何圖形表示自然變化。諸加此類，都足證明要硏究自然科學，必須對高等算學有番深切的認識；特別是對於高等算學怎樣的應用於自然科學，更非有確切的瞭解不可。</p>
<p>然而　通常的算學教本，每多只注重於算學理論的敍述，對於其在自然科學的應用，則語焉不詳。學生學了、只會解決算學題目，不能瞭解自然現象與形式算學的純粹抽象性之間的關係，更不能發現算學方法與自然變化問彼此的補充性。所以對於科學中有算學根據的定理或方程式，以及應用算學法則解決的問題，都不能明白其究免，一知半解。列談不到用算學法則來研究自然現象了。由此觀之，一本以自然科學爲出發點，而能詳述算學法則如何應用於自然現象之研討的算學書，實爲初習科學者所需。商務印書館最近出版的「理化用高等算學」，便是一本以自然科學爲出發點的算學畫。原著者Mellor在這本書中，解釋任何幾個有名的自然變化敍述出來，實爲該書最大優點。這不獨可以使讀者明瞭算學與科學息息相關之國，並且，從算學書的立塲說，它避免了那種應用抽象問題來敎授算學的老法子。例如，微係數（Differental</p>
<p>Coffieient)與極限比的意義，用化學反應的速度來敘述，自然界的複利律(Compound　Interdst　Law　inNature)是從指數函數的求微係數法引導出來；不連續函數引導出Mendelddff關於溶液中含水物存在性的工作；質量作用定律引出對於積分法的步驟作詳盡的研究；物體運動方程式爲硏究二次微分方程式的基礎；Harcourt與Esson的工作引入聯立微分方程式的硏究；傳氏級數(F.ouriers　Serise）應用於擴散作用等。讀者閱畢，對於算學原理應用於自然現象之硏討的方法，當可有番深切之認識。</p>
<p>原畫分微分法，解析幾何學，有奇異性的函數，積分法，無限級數及其用途，數値方程式解法，微分方式解法，傳氏定理，或然率與誤差論，變分法，行列式等十一章。書中之習題大都採自歐美近代出版的科學雜誌論文巾的實驗記錄。書末並附有公式集及數値表，頗合參考之用。全書分二巨册，約近一千頁，定價</p>
<p>讀者僅須讀過初等代數，三角，並對於物理化學的初步定理已有相當的熟習，便可無困能的閱讀本書。筆者願將此書鄭重的介紹給初入大學而有志研究科學的同學。</p>
<h3>革命史話</h3>
<p>— 余其若</p>
<p>陸丹林著</p>
<p>大東書局出版</p>
<p>近十多年來，關於國民黨史料的書，先後出版的有十多部，或屬專史，或屬逸事，各有他的特點。革命史話，是陸丹林氏繼續他的「革命史譚」而最近出版的。本書共收文章十七篇，其中有　事實的考證，如檀香山興中會的成立和民國前的黨務，大明順天國起義始末，黎元洪是否由床下拖出，雲南起義的實際策動者等皆是。屬於文學方面的，有黃花崗詩話，寫述三十多人憑弔黃花崗烈士的詩句，民國前革命黨人的文學，是夾叙夾議黨人們的文學，是提出他的時代性正義感。關於國父事跡的，有總理倫敦被難的二三事，中華銀行與革命黨，總理大本營手札等。海外黨史有關的，如同盟會成立的前後，士官生的丈夫團，四十年前的新世紀等。黃花崗是革命的聖地，描寫他的周遭的，有黃花崗全貌一篇。其他還有幾篇，都和革命有關的軼事秘史。</p>
<p>陸氏十多年來，是專研近代史，尤其是黨史，故寫來自與坊間道聽塗說的不同，每一篇，每一事，都是有他的實際性，因爲其中有許多資料，是他個人所獨有，而再經過一番詳細考訂分析纔定結論。如故宮從前出版的文獻　編所印的大明順天國檄文吿示兩張，一般人都以爲是太平天國時代的文物，他却考訂是光緒廿八年，洪全福李紀堂們在廣州起義文件。又如雲南起義，多數人都說是蔡鍔主動，而他却拿出眞實憑證，說蔡只是附從。而非主動。興中會在檀香山成立至今五十三年，當年的事跡，他從世間僅有的最初紀錄裏找出實際的直接資料和四十多年前的外國報紙做根據。這種考訂工夫，實有他的獨特之點存在的</p>
<p>葉恭綽的序文有云：「……丹林陸子，究心史事，以餘暇爲革命史話一册，體雖非正史，而所記頗多異聞實錄，誠史家所必采，而學者所應有者也。……丹林此書，記述詳愼，又宗旨無所偏倚，信可爲斯類佳著，固宜公之於世，且願丹林繼此續有所作，爲國史之副車，庶革命眞相，瞭然於民衆心目，其有助於建國大業，當非淺尠。……」葉氏此番話，說來也很公允的當，擇錄幾句，而和我的評介相參證。</p>
<h3>正義的洪鐘</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>讀羅曼羅蘭的「狼羣」</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭的一生，是獻身爲自由，人道，正義的奮鬥上，在他的不朽的巨著「約翰•克利斯朵夫」書前，曾寫着以此書：「獻給全世界受苦奮鬥，終必戰勝的，自由靈魂。」正養磅礴，不屈不撓的精神，誠如白虹貫日，足與天地永埀不朽！至於「狼羣」一劇，也是羅曼羅蘭的偉大的著作之一。亦足稱此精神之表現，好似一座正義的洪鐘，朗朗聲浪，震撼着大地。</p>
<p>「狼羣」是取材於一七九二年法國大革命時的歷史事件。那時法國的革命軍追擊亡命的貴族，但是被普魯士軍隊國困在萊茵河左岸上的一個呌迷羊斯市內，革命軍與敵對壘，作長久的籠城戰，傾全力圖突圍而出。全劇的進行，沉毅嚴肅，緊張熱烈；於靜默時，可聽見遠遠的大砲步槍聲，或街上軍隊的匆促步伐聾，軍樂，軍歌，號令等，混亂與動蕩的氣氛交織成一遍。</p>
<p>當國家瀕於危亡的關頭，革命軍內部的軍官復互相猜疑忌刻。劇中人「多瓦龍」，因爲出身在貴族階級，爲人傲慢的緣故，所以那冷靜沉着，注意周到，出身在學士會會員的「推里耶」，和勇猛組暴，出身在猪肉商人的司令官「維拉」都憎惡着他。這時維拉利用機會陷害了多瓦龍。然陷害事實的真相，被推里耶識破了，於是他毅然爲了正義，忘却平時的仇恨，面挺身爲多瓦龍辯護，一面要求敘判維拉的奸計。正在推里耶仗義發言時，維拉打勝了仗，所有同僚中的軍官，都盲目擁護有功的維拉，忘記了正義，終於推里耶獨力難戰，反爲正義犧牲了，全劇至此結束。</p>
<p>讀完此劇，我們同顧人類的歷史，其中經過不少千變萬化，滄海桑田，生死莫測，就像一幕最偉大的戲劇。在裏面最足可貴者，只有忠貞不移的正義的氣節，然因其最難保有，故愈見珍貴，値得萬世讚頌。</p>
<p>我國在宋室偏安後，因奸臣當道，天下日趨混亂，元兵加緊進攻。當時朝政却完全給昏庸誤國的奸臣把持着，只有民族英雄文天祥在艱苦破爛的局面下，作英勇的奮鬥。最後雖被囚入獄，然其志不移。他所作的「正氣歌」，說明了正氣爲何物：「當國家承平的時候，這種浩然之氣，可以在朝廷上大放光明，亂世能顯出人的節烈，這節烈的浩然之氣，就永遠名埀靑史，萬古流芳；共河山不朽，與日月爭光。」其壯志，其魄力，巳表現無遣！</p>
<p>現在我們試從「狼羣」中節引幾段推里耶的說話：</p>
<p>「我們在這裏捨身忘命的是為着什麼呢？這是爲幾個加可本（Jacobin)黨員的野心麼？格斯勒！國家用兵，是爲的正義。如果國家一旦侵犯了正義，那與我們揮　相同的暴君的巢窟何異？它會從世界上消滅去的……壓迫人的法蘭西，必蹈此覆轍。我寗肯用自己的手來將它破壞。」</p>
<p>「各位，你們知道我是如何痛恨多瓦龍的。昨天早上，我還攻擊過他。但對待一個仇人，應與對待一個朋友一樣，要嚴正地維持名譽。假使他的無罪的證據，偶然落在我手裏，我應當怎樣做呢？這不得不忘去平常的仇恨，而想一種匡救不正的方法」。</p>
<p>「我們應得從理性上說話。理性，理性，理性。這個聲音一響出，無人敢於反抗的。我服從理性，有必要時，我可以爲它犧牲我的友誼，我的憎惡，以至我的生命。你們也有聽着它的聲音的時候，你們應當總從它。假如你們要忌避它，它是極強硬的。它將要裁判一切。………</p>
<p>這是全劇的骨關，是羅曼羅蘭要對世人大聲疾呼的話。</p>
<p>最後推里那壯烈犧牲了，正如文天祥從容就義一樣，他們雖死，但是他們永遠能「留取丹心照汗靑」！他們　是象微着人類歷刦不減，亘長存的正直的靈魂！</p>
<p>目前中國社會的風氣，已是腐敗不堪，爲了挽救頹風，我們必須事不分大小，也要本着正義所在而奮鬥，做到「威武不能屈，富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移」。本此而行，蔚爲風尙；以忠義比日月，以正氣貫長虹，這樣才能打出巾國人民的一條活路來。羅曼羅蘭這本「狼羣」，我們最近能看見了沈起予的中譯本，（上海駱駝書店版），應値得我們特別注意。因爲它正好給我們改良社會風氣，一個絕大的警惕與鼓勵。</p>

<p>At 12:45 AM, the Chairman and his wife traveled by car to the Shanghai Wan Guo Public Cemetery on Hongqiao Road, laid flowers and paid their respects at the tomb of Madame Soong, and then drove south along Hongqiao Road, enjoying the autumnal scenery of the fields.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Remained in Qingdao for Five Days, Summoning Shandong Provincial Generals</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 21st]</p>

Admiral Cooke of the US Navy called at Zhengyangguan Road that day, spoke briefly, and then left. On the 17th, he visited Zhan Shan Temple at noon. The temple was not specially notified beforehand. After inspecting for a week, he left. Abbot Shanbo hurriedly arrived at the Mahavira Hall and paid his respects to the Chairman on behalf of the monks. On the same day, he also went to Guodao Island (at the mouth of Jiaozhou Bay, the most prominent part of Qingdao, where a fort was built in the past but is now abandoned). In the afternoon, he went to the Observatory Hill, which is 79 meters above sea level. The Chairman got out of the car and climbed up, surveying the entire city. The vast sea was in sight, and all kinds of ships in the port were clearly visible. Qingdao Garrison Commander Ding Zhipan, Mayor Li Xianliang, and others accompanied him to the above places. At 5:40 PM in the afternoon, when he arrived at the Municipal Government, it was already after office hours. Mayor Li Xianliang was still in his office. The Chairman briefly inspected the Mayor's office and the auditorium, praising the magnificent architecture of the Municipal Government. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, he went to the Naval Academy to address all the officers and students. Wang Yaowu, Li Yannian, Wang Shuming, and other generals above the division commander level from various places in Shandong arrived on the 17th and 18th successively. Gui Yongqing was originally in Qingdao. The Chairman summoned them separately for inquiries. On the 18th, Shen Changhuan flew in from Nanjing. On the 19th, the Chairman, dressed in casual clothes, paid a return visit to Admiral Cooke. On the 19th and 20th, the Chairman summoned the generals for talks at the Lishi Society. After having lunch with the generals at the Lishi Society on the 21st, he went to Cangko Airport to board the plane and leave Qingdao. During his five days in Qingdao, the Chairman got up at 6:00 AM every morning to read, paint, and pray, as usual, and often took walks by the sea.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 21st] The Chairman summoned various Shandong generals for conferences for three consecutive days, with Wang Shuming and Gui Yongqing also participating. It is reported that the inquiries and discussions included only the issue of clearing the remaining bandits in Shandong Province, and did not address overall military matters.</p>

<p>He finally stated in an affirmative tone:</p>
<p>The debate over freedom versus</p>
<p>control that has been going on for many years has come to an end. In other words,</p>
<p>the laissez-faire policy has been abandoned, because</p>
<p>everyone from the top down, whether in charge or in business,</p>

<p>he can offer many concrete and feasible</p>
<p>suggestions for improvement regarding finance, cotton yarn, fuel,</p>
<p>grain and oil, and economic administration, for the authorities to adopt.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons for the rising prices this time. Later,</p>
<p>due to reasons such as the tightening of credit, it has become stable.</p>
<p>The government will design effective</p>
<p>measures targeting various reasons. When asked about his impressions of this trip to Shanghai,</p>
<p>he believed that there is a need to strengthen cooperation among all parties, and</p>
<p>pointed out that official-civil relations still need to be fully communicated.</p>

<h3>Mr. Du Yuesheng Advocates Sino-British Joint Transport</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Since the British Parliamentary Delegation to China</p>
<p>expressed opinions on the issue of opening up inland waterway navigation rights, those concerned with the shipping industry have risen up in opposition.</p>
<p>A reporter interviewed Du Yuesheng, Director of the National Shipping Association,</p>
<p>to solicit his opinion. He said:</p>
<p>"Now that our country has recovered its inland waterway navigation rights, there is absolutely no reason to open them up.</p>
<p>However, in order to develop trade between China and Britain, our country's shipping industry is extremely willing to cooperate sincerely with</p>
<p>British shipping companies. The best way to do this is to hold</p>
<p>joint transport operations. Then Sino-British trade will definitely be smooth.</p>
<p>The transportation blockages that the delegation is concerned about</p>
<p>will not be a problem at all." As for expanding ship tonnage and improving driving techniques,</p>
<p>the government and the industry are working together. Given time, it will surely be able to</p>
<p>live up to the expectations of the people and friendly countries.</p>
<h3>Our Policy of Prohibiting Foreign Vessels from Inland Rivers Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Regarding the navigation rights of foreign</p>
<p>vessels on our inland rivers, our government</p>
<p>has not opened them up, nor has it considered changing them.</p>

<p>has not changed.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Political Committee Reviews Northeastern Military and Political Affairs</h3>

<h3>Airlifted Troops Reinforce Steadily; Jilin-Changchun Battle Situation Stabilizing; Air Force Squadrons Strafe, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] The Jilin-Changchun</p>
<p>battle situation is stabilizing. Airlifted troops have been continuously arriving</p>
<p>in Changchun and Jilin in recent days, and the strength of the defending forces in these two key cities has been</p>
<p>increased. Xiaofengman is also being held firmly. The National Army has been</p>
<p>largely passive in the past due to various difficulties.</p>
<p>In the future, it will gradually strive for local initiative, and then strive for overall initiative after</p>
<p>its strength is replenished. According to a certain military</p>
<p>official: the bandits' sixth offensive has now become chronic.</p>
<p>The bandits' goals of destroying transportation, looting</p>
<p>the autumn harvest, and eating small units of the National Army</p>
<p>may have been partially achieved, but the National Army's field army</p>
<p>has not been attacked, and it is working hard to defend major strongholds.</p>
<p>Success will be achieved by ensuring that small units are no longer eaten.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch of the 22nd] The Jilin defense</p>
<p>battle has been intense for days. The bandits are currently concentrating their</p>
<p>forces to attack Jilin City and Xiaofengman. Yesterday, the area</p>
<p>between Jilin and Fengman was disturbed by bandits. Military</p>
<p>observers here believe that although Jilin and Fengman have been split into two by bandits,</p>
<p>the defending forces in both places will absolutely not allow the invading</p>
<p>bandits to succeed within a week. Dehui and Changchun had no</p>
<p>contact all day yesterday. Air Force reconnaissance revealed that the bandits attacking Dehui were</p>
<p>advancing rapidly towards Jilin. Relevant sources have learned: The</p>
<p>reinforcements heading north from Siping have already passed Hersu, east of Siping, and are</p>
<p>advancing towards Yitong, pressing towards the Jilin-Changchun area. The bandits are currently</p>
<p>actively reinforcing Jilin. In the suburbs of Changchun, many bandits are gathering along the Jilin-Changchun Highway towards Bonihezi, and even</p>
<p>a new artillery force from Dunhua has arrived at Yantongshan, continuing</p>
<p>northward along the Jilin-Shenyang Line.</p>

The bandits who had been roaming around in various villages and towns along the Changchun-Gongzhuling section of the Middle-East Railway have also scattered to the Dehui and Jiutai areas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch of the 22nd] Today, the Air Force</p>
<p>participated in the Jilin defense battle in squadrons, strafing</p>

<p>by the Air Force's concentrated bombs. It is also learned that the bandit</p>
<p>combat troops in Shuangyang and Yitong counties south of Changchun have</p>
<p>successively fled eastward. Currently, the puppet district government of the bandits occupies and harasses the two cities,</p>
<p>massively requisitioning grain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jilin Dispatch of the 21st] On the</p>
<p>morning of the 20th, our ground forces in the Dachangtun area,</p>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee Decides Taiwan to Adopt Free Elections, Review of Three-Party Candidate Lists Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The review of</p>
<p>the National Assembly candidate lists for the three parties,</p>
<p>began on the 22nd, and the review of the lists for Taiwan and Zhejiang</p>
<p>provinces has also begun. The review work is being conducted by</p>
<p>a joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Steering Committee,</p>
<p>chaired by Zhu Jiahua. He first presented</p>
<p>the opinion of the Joint Provincial Election Committee, believing that the Joint Province</p>
<p>should only partially nominate candidates, with the rest being freely elected.</p>
<p>After discussion in the meeting, it was believed that partially nominating and partially freely electing</p>
<p>would cause some possible problems. It was decided that all of Taiwan</p>
<p>should adopt free election methods. The Zhejiang Province list</p>
<p>has not yet been fully reviewed, and it has been decided that</p>
<p>the candidate quota for some counties will be given to the Democratic and Youth Party</p>
<p>candidates. However, if the candidates are important Kuomintang</p>
<p>officials, they will not be given up. Otherwise, all will be nominated, but the Kuomintang will not adopt</p>
<p>intense electioneering. Furthermore, this meeting to review the lists</p>
<p>will be held continuously, first by region, then by</p>
<p>professional group. (News about overseas Chinese competing in elections can be found on page two, column five.)</p>
<h3>Proust Issues Statement, Advocates Immediate US Aid to China, Fully Agrees with Bullitt's Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Proust stated: In the struggle between Communism and Liberalism</p>
<p>currently unfolding in the world, a strong China should be the cornerstone of US foreign policy. He advocates immediately assisting China. Regarding Bullitt's suggestion that the United States</p>
<p>should provide $1.35 billion in aid to China, he stated: He fully sympathizes with Bullitt's position, but he is unwilling to make any</p>
<p>statements regarding the amount of dollars in this matter. He stated: I do not underestimate the difficulties faced by China, nor do I dispute the criticisms leveled at the Central Government, but I firmly believe that</p>
<p>President Chiang's determination is that he is dedicated to the salvation of China according to democratic principles. He emphasized that if peace in the Far East and the world can be ensured,</p>
<p>then aid to China is absolutely necessary. He believes that the Weidmeier Report will be released sooner than generally expected.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Since returning to the United States, Bullitt has been actively promoting a plan for the United States to immediately provide substantial assistance to the Chinese government</p>
<p>to combat Communism. It is reported that he is determined to implement his plan to aid China as described in Life magazine. The article has attracted the attention of diplomatic circles and senior government officials.</p>
<p>It is reported that he has met with Weidmeier and Eisenhower. He expressed optimism, believing that the US government may provide the Chinese</p>
<p>government with practical and substantial assistance.</p>
<h3>US Newspapers Consider Failure to Publish Weidmeier's Report a Mistake</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The Scripps Howard</p>
<p>newspaper chain criticized President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall</p>
<p>for delaying the release of Weidmeier's report, and reiterated that the situation in China</p>
<p>urgently requires emergency assistance from the United States. The New York World-Telegram and</p>
<p>Washington News, among other newspapers in the chain, stated that not publishing the Weidmeier</p>
<p>Report is a major mistake. This action has not accelerated American assistance to the Chinese government, nor can it increase people's confidence in the US government's policy.</p>
<p>To achieve these three outcomes, this long-delayed report must be released.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] The US State Department's statement released yesterday, which was only 128 words long, to explain why Weidmeier's report on his visit to China was not released,</p>
<p>greatly puzzled observers here, who all believed that this vague statement failed to clarify the mystery surrounding this issue. It also failed to make the American people deeply aware of what the US government's policy toward China actually is.</p>
<p>One commentator even suspected whether Secretary of State Marshall believed that China's "reform work" was not yet suitable for the conditions he set for immediate and substantial aid to China. If such speculation is true, the commentator</p>
<p>believed that Marshall has ignored the entirely new situation that has emerged in China since he left China the year before. He also believed that China's current</p>
<p>problem is no longer purely a matter of domestic political reform, but a struggle for survival with the Communists.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Ryukyu Must Be Returned to China</h3>
<p>Since Premier Zhang attended the Resident Councilors' meeting and reported on</p>
<p>our country's military, political, and diplomatic measures, carefully mentioning: "Ryukyu has a special relationship with our country.</p>
<p>It should be returned to China," the Washington and Tokyo sides</p>
<p>have paid close attention to our country's request. Originally,</p>
<p>regarding the scope of Japanese territory, the November 1943 Cairo</p>
<p>Declaration only decided: "The four northeastern provinces, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, etc.,</p>
<p>should be returned to the Republic of China." The future status of Ryukyu was not mentioned.</p>
<p>The July 1945 Potsdam Declaration, implementing the spirit of the Cairo Declaration,</p>
<p>stipulated: "Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido,</p>
<p>Kyushu, Shikoku and such other minor islands as we determine," meaning the status of Ryukyu</p>
<p>remains undecided. Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi and veteran parliamentarian Ozaki Yukio said: Ryukyu should belong to Japan, and misinterpreted the "other minor islands" referred to in the Potsdam Declaration</p>
<p>as including the Ryukyu Islands, etc. The Ryukyu people opposed Japan's misinterpretation, and Chinese scholars have cited historical facts to</p>
<p>explain the relationship between China and Ryukyu, mostly arguing that Ryukyu should be returned to our country.</p>
<p>Standing from a research standpoint, based on Ryukyu's history, geography, and human relations,</p>
<p>we support the government's view and solemnly declare to the Allied nations: Ryukyu</p>
<p>must be returned to China!</p>
<p>The earliest political relationship between Ryukyu and Asian countries was with</p>
<p>China. In our country's ancient books, the Sui Dynasty called it "Liúqiú," the Tang Dynasty called it "Liúqiú,"</p>
<p>"Liúchóu," or "Liúqiú," and the name "Liúqiú" first appeared in the Yuan Dynasty,</p>
<p>and has been used ever since. According to the "Ryukyu" section of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the relationship between China and Ryukyu can be traced back to</p>
<p>605 AD, the first year of Emperor Yang of Sui's Daye era, which is the same as recorded in Chinese records</p>
<p>(such as the Book of Sui). However, Ryukyu officially became a vassal state of China,</p>
<p>starting from the early Ming Dynasty. Thereafter, it not only paid tribute every year, but also</p>
<p>came to the court every generation; and sent government students, observing rituals with great respect. Official histories and private</p>
<p>writings have repeatedly recorded this, and there is ample evidence. After the Jiajing era in the Ming Dynasty,</p>
<p>the country gradually declined, border administration was neglected, Western powers invaded Nanyang, and Japan</p>
<p>also coveted Ryukyu; however, the Ryukyu royal family continued to pay tribute to</p>
<p>China as before. Our country's envoys to Ryukyu</p>
<p>also followed one after another. Until the mid-Qing Dynasty, Ryukyu always recognized China</p>
<p>as its suzerain state, treating itself as a vassal. Even under Japanese oppression later,</p>
<p>the strong will of the Ryukyu people did not change their loyalty to China in the slightest.</p>
<p>We only need to read Ryukyu's documents to see this immediately. Recently, the Ryukyu</p>
<p>Revolutionary Comrades Association's "Refutation of Japan's Ambition" further proves that the Ryukyu</p>
<p>people despise the absurdity of people like Ashida and Ozaki, and are not ashamed of what they have done.</p>
<p>From a geographical point of view, Ryukyu and Taiwan are both the shoulders of China,</p>
<p>with a relationship of national interdependence. Ryukyu is an archipelago, extending</p>
<p>between Taiwan and Kyushu, Japan, forming a large arc, located on the outer edge of China's</p>
<p>East Sea, winding across the sea for 800 miles from northeast to southwest,</p>
<p>including more than 70 islands, with an area of 5,000 square kilometers and a population of 800,000.</p>
<p>In terms of latitude and longitude, Ryukyu is located between 24 and 31 degrees north latitude, and 124 and 130 degrees east longitude,</p>
<p>each accounting for more than 7 degrees. Greater Ryukyu is Okinawa Island, and Lesser Ryukyu is the largest island of the Amami</p>
<p>Islands, both of which are strategically important. After Japan occupied Taiwan in the 21st year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, it further</p>
<p>intensified its efforts to manage Ryukyu, making it a stepping stone for southward aggression, proving that Japan's occupation of Ryukyu was entirely for the purpose of aggression. Now,</p>
<p>the intention to seize Ryukyu still contains the ambition to not give up aggression. We</p>
<p>must especially point out that the total area of the Ryukyu Islands is only 5,000 square</p>
<p>kilometers, with a population of 800,000, and its economic value is extremely limited; however,</p>
<p>when the American and Japanese forces fought for Greater Ryukyu, a total of more than 200,000 troops were mobilized, fighting fiercely for</p>
<p>83 days. American Tenth Army Commander General Buckner died in this battle, and</p>
<p>115,000 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, defending to the last man. When the kamikaze</p>
<p>suicide planes were unable to exert their power, Tokyo announced its surrender. All of this</p>
<p>illustrates the importance of the strategic value of the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>Japan occupied Ryukyu in order to consolidate its inner maritime defense line, and the US military</p>
<p>controlled Ryukyu in order to open the way for its fleet to reach China and the Yellow Sea,</p>
<p>and then advance to China and Korea. Our country, from the perspective of the relationship between China and Ryukyu, demands</p>
<p>that Ryukyu be returned to China for the sake of peace and to ensure the safety of Taiwan and China's territorial</p>
<p>waters. China has no intention of using Ryukyu as a support point for aggression.</p>
<p>At the same time, for the sake of peace in Taiwan and the sea, our country does not want Ryukyu</p>
<p>to become any country's military strategic zone. What our country wants to help Ryukyu with is</p>
<p>the high degree of autonomy of the Ryukyu people; what our country wants to develop in Ryukyu is that</p>
<p>the traditional culture of the Ryukyu people derived from China can be preserved. The Ryukyu people's</p>
<p>bloodline and culture have had a relationship with China for thousands of years; today, the Ryukyu</p>
<p>people still worship Confucius, live their lives with Tang Dynasty customs, and we</p>
<p>cannot bear to sever the pulse of the nation. For the sake of future peace and</p>
<p>security, we must insist on possessing Ryukyu as a condition. Our war of resistance was for the</p>
<p>survival of the nation; the Cairo and Potsdam documents did not reject China's possession</p>
<p>of Ryukyu. Regarding this undecided issue, we should strive for it legally.</p>
<p>Today, the Ryukyu people and the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association have earnestly</p>
<p>issued their calls: "The area south of 30 degrees north latitude to Yonaguni Island</p>
<p>is the ancient territory of Ryukyu, and is also a part of China, the front line for defending</p>
<p>the mainland." "Today, at this good opportunity for the liberation of the Ryukyu nation,</p>
<p>we hope that the Chinese government will pay attention to the calls of our comrades." Due to Director Zhang's</p>
<p>statement, our government's decision that Ryukyu should be immediately returned to China</p>
<p>will surely be supported by the 800,000 Ryukyu people. We hope that the enlightened</p>
<p>friendly nations will respect the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, recognize the reality of the Ryukyu</p>
<p>people's quest for liberation, and support the demands of the Chinese and Ryukyu people, so that Ryukyu</p>
<p>can be returned to China as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporter's Questions</h3>
<p>Wheat and Rice Shortage Approximately 60,000 Tons</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) According to current</p>
<p>estimates of our country's population and</p>
<p>food consumption, the national wheat requirement</p>
<p>is 24,478,000 tons, and the rice requirement is 51,436,000</p>
<p>tons. It is estimated that before the next harvest</p>
<p>season, there will be a wheat shortage of 2,950,000</p>
<p>tons and a rice shortage of 3,092,000</p>
<p>tons. In recent years, the main sources of China's imported</p>
<p>food have been UNRRA, the United States, Canada,</p>
<p>Indochina, etc.</p>
<p>Ample Coal Supply Expected This Winter</p>
<p>Director Dong said:</p>
<p>As for our country's</p>
<p>monthly coal production,</p>
<p>rough estimates are: North China 600,000 tons,</p>
<p>Northeast 300,000 tons, East China 100,000 tons, Central</p>
<p>China 100,000 tons, Taiwan 100,000 tons. Of the</p>
<p>600,000 tons in North China, 500,000 tons is sufficient for</p>
<p>consumption in that region, and 100,000 tons can be transported to help South</p>
<p>China and Central China. The current difficulty is the</p>
<p>transportation problem. However, the national coal supply this winter is expected</p>
<p>to be sufficient.</p>
<p>No Restrictions on Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>Regarding the question</p>
<p>of whether the Chinese</p>
<p>government is considering</p>
<p>implementing press censorship in military or non-military areas,</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: Even during the current bandit</p>
<p>suppression operations, the government has no intention of implementing press censorship.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no provisions restricting freedom of the press</p>
<p>in the Outline for the Implementation of General Mobilization. Furthermore,</p>
<p>Article 12 of Chapter II of the Constitution states that people have freedom of</p>
<p>secret correspondence, except as provided in Article 23 of Chapter II of the Constitution,</p>
<p>which stipulates that it should be excluded when necessary to avoid emergency</p>
<p>dangers, maintain social order, or promote public</p>
<p>interests. The National Government promulgated and implemented the Martial Law Act on November 29,</p>
<p>1934, Article 3 of which</p>
<p>stipulates that during wartime, when a certain area is surrounded by the enemy</p>
<p>or faces extraordinary changes, the highest commander of the area may declare temporary martial law.</p>
<p>Article 12 of the Judicial Regulations stipulates that within the martial law</p>
<p>area, the highest commander has the power to carry out the following matters: To suspend gatherings, associations, or ban new newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, slogans, etc.,</p>
<p>deemed to be detrimental to military affairs; To inspect</p>
<p>postal mail and telegrams, and detain or confiscate them if necessary. Currently, because</p>
<p>the Communist bandits are in full-scale rebellion, the government,</p>
<p>in order to protect military secrets and suppress bandits to quell the rebellion, is conducting temporary partial spot checks of postal and telegraphic communications in pacification</p>
<p>zones and areas near combat zones based on leads. However, it must still be submitted to higher authorities for approval before it can be carried out. If</p>
<p>Communist bandits flee to a certain area or Communist</p>
<p>subversives in a certain area attempt to riot, higher</p>
<p>authorities may also order it to be carried out at any time. In short, this</p>
<p>partial postal and telegraphic spot check method is neither</p>
<p>universal nor permanent, but an emergency measure</p>
<p>taken to avoid emergency dangers and maintain social order. Based on leads,</p>
<p>it is used to spot check postal and telegraphic communications suspected of providing secret information to the Communist bandits,</p>
<p>and does not hinder the freedom of communication of the general public, and especially does not affect</p>
<p>the transmission of news by mail or telegraph.</p>
<p>Foreign Correspondents' Cables Not Subject to Control</p>
<p>[United Press,</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd</p>
<p>Dispatch] News Bureau</p>
<p>Director Dong Xian Guang admitted today that the Ministry of National Defense had ordered military authorities in the war</p>
<p>zones to implement postal and telegraphic inspection, and news dispatches are not exempt. However, he declared that the Chinese government</p>
<p>has no intention of restoring press censorship. Regarding the detention of the United Press's Qingdao cable, he said that he had telegraphed the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>for inquiry. Dong also stated: Temporary local postal and telegraphic inspections are not enough to affect</p>
<p>newspapers, and foreign correspondents' news sent abroad is neither subject to control nor inspection.</p>
<p>This is an indisputable fact. However, many foreign correspondents asked Dong to note that this statement does not match the facts.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Du Yuesheng's Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Mr. Du said in his speech:</p>
<p>"Chairman Lord Ammon, distinguished guests, the six distinguished guests of the British</p>
<p>Parliamentary Delegation have come to visit.</p>
<p>The Chinese government and people express their warm welcome.</p>
<p>The Shanghai business and industrial community is very pleased and excited to hold this reception today.</p>
<p>China and Britain have always had friendly relations, and their commercial relationship</p>
<p>has an especially long history. They fought shoulder to shoulder in the Second World War, sharing weal and woe, and their friendship has become more</p>
<p>substantial. This friendship has continued to grow after the war. The British</p>
<p>Parliamentary Delegation's visit to China this time is a testament to the British friends' deep concern for China, and</p>
<p>will further enhance the friendship between China and Britain in the future.</p>
<p>China and Britain both suffered severe blows during the war.</p>
<p>They also suffered the same economic panic after the war.</p>
<p>In order to achieve economic recovery and prosperity in both countries, practical</p>
<p>cooperation is necessary. Britain is an advanced industrial country.</p>
<p>After victory, it is striving for recovery, and the system left over from the war</p>
<p>continues to be implemented in order to meet the needs of recovery.</p>
<p>It is trying every possible means to increase production and export in large quantities.</p>
<p>This is such a solemn and calm attitude, and its value</p>
<p>is worth our learning from. Since victory, in addition to general difficulties,</p>
<p>China's various constructions have been hindered by the Communist Party's rebellion,</p>
<p>and the development of industry and commerce has also been greatly affected.</p>
<p>However, we firmly believe that the Communist Party's rebellion will surely be quelled,</p>
<p>just like the victory we reaped in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Our country's business and industrial workers are now, under the government's</p>
<p>guidance and assistance, working hard to overcome this difficult period. The friendship between China and Britain, which is characterized by friendliness</p>
<p>and harmony, has become more and more prominent over time.</p>
<p>In addition, we deeply feel that the economic prosperity and decline of</p>
<p>countries around the world are interconnected and inseparable. We hope that our British friends, who are known for their developed industry and commerce, can provide us with assistance.</p>
<p>What Lord Ammon said on the eve of leaving England for China, that</p>
<p>"the British Parliament and people care about China today as much as they did during the war,"</p>
<p>his sincere attitude and warm concern will be unforgettable for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>China needs to import British equipment and materials.</p>
<p>Before the war, China was a large market for British exporters. After the war,</p>
<p>business between China and Britain remains to be developed, and the future development of British</p>
<p>trade also relies on the rapid prosperity of China's large market as a precursor. Therefore, the practical</p>
<p>cooperation between China and Britain is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>At the time of welcoming the distinguished guests, I respectfully</p>
<p>extend my welcome on behalf of the business and industrial community, and I hope that each</p>
<p>distinguished guest will give us more guidance!"</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Agreement on Handling Remaining Materials for Relief (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>All remaining relief materials in each sub-office</p>
<p>should be transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs around the closing date. These</p>
<p>relief materials include food (staple foods,</p>
<p>non-staple foods), clothing, textiles, shoes and socks,</p>
<p>and miscellaneous welfare materials; but medical equipment</p>
<p>is not included. The three parties agree that on the date when the materials</p>
<p>are transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs will allocate half of each item</p>
<p>to the United Welfare Organizations Federation (hereinafter referred to as "Fúlian"),</p>
<p>and Fúlian will immediately extract them from the warehouses. The Ministry of Social</p>
<p>Affairs should issue two receipts for the materials received,</p>
<p>sending one each to UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration. Fúlian should issue</p>
<p>four receipts, sending the original to the Ministry of Social Affairs,</p>
<p>and three copies to UNRRA, the Executive Relief Administration, and the Fúlian General Association.</p>
<p>When the aforementioned materials are transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Fúlian,</p>
<p>the Executive Relief Administration should also provide sufficient funds to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Fúlian</p>
<p>for the purpose of distributing the materials to the final recipients.</p>
<p>To save procedures, the three parties agree that the Executive Relief Administration should transfer</p>
<p>these funds to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Fúlian through the Central Bank; and set up</p>
<p>two accounts separately for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Fúlian to remit to various places for application</p>
<p>(excluding Shanghai). The total amount of the aforementioned funds should</p>
<p>be notified to the Ministry of Social Affairs in advance. The payment</p>
<p>of the aforementioned funds should be calculated based on the cost</p>
<p>required to distribute each ton of materials within each region. This basis</p>
<p>should apply to all materials, but should vary depending on the region.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Social Affairs should provide detailed reports on the inventory and distribution</p>
<p>of received materials to UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration, and Fúlian</p>
<p>should provide detailed reports to the Ministry of Social Affairs as well.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Gives 100 Vehicles to Guangdong Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] Today's</p>
<p>news: UNRRA, at the request of the Guangdong Provincial Government,</p>
<p>will give 100 trucks to the Guangdong Provincial Government to improve</p>

<p>to attend this meeting.</p>
<h3>Kawashima Yoshiko Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] When Jin Bihui arrived in court, she was wearing</p>
<p>a snow-white sweater that hugged her neck, green woolen trousers,</p>
<p>a black woolen coat,</p>
<p>black leather shoes, and her hair was still styled in a men's side part,</p>
<p>shining brightly. She wore light powder and looked quite cheerful.</p>
<p>After Judge Wu confirmed Jin's identity, he pronounced the sentence:</p>
<p>"Jin Bihui conspired with an enemy country, plotting to revolt against</p>
<p>this country, and is sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life,</p>
<p>and her property is confiscated except for a discretionary amount to be retained for the necessary living expenses of her family."</p>
<p>Wu continued to explain that this sentence was based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors,</p>
<p>and informed her that she could appeal within ten days if she disagreed.</p>
<p>After hearing the sentence, Jin remained calm</p>
<p>and showed no fear. After the sentence was pronounced, she turned her head and</p>
<p>automatically walked back to the women's prison for detention, and then had</p>
<p>lunch as usual, eating two steamed buns. After the meal, she came to</p>
<p>the wire mesh window of the women's prison, which was just over two square feet,</p>
<p>and met with this newspaper's reporter. Asked if she was preparing</p>
<p>to appeal, she replied that she would decide after consulting with her lawyer, Li Yishen.</p>
<p>Jin said that her concept of life and death was extremely</p>
<p>indifferent. "Anyway, I'm going to die sooner or later," "It's</p>
<p>better to die early than to live badly," and she fully expressed</p>
<p>her realism. "I'm not worried about death, I'm just worried that the prison</p>
<p>won't have a stove in the winter, and I don't have any clothes. How will I survive the winter?"</p>
<p>Jin said that she had been "wronged." "Even if you sentence me for one day, I feel wronged.</p>
<p>Those of you who were in Beiping during the occupation can inquire and see what bad things I did."</p>
<p>She flatly overturned her confession at the Eleventh War Zone Military Tribunal,</p>
<p>saying that she was tricked into signing it, and that she was captured because she was too famous.</p>
<p>Asked why she was so famous, she replied cleverly:</p>
<p>"Think about it, a princess of a fallen country, growing up in exile</p>
<p>in a foreign country, how can people not suspect her?"</p>
<p>After nearly two years in prison, she still stubbornly uses painting,</p>
<p>writing, and feeding insects to pass the nearly ending days behind bars.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Friendship Association and Others Oppose Packaged Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Kuomintang members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association,</p>
<p>the Kuomintang's carefully selected National Assembly representatives, and the Legislative Supervisory Comrades United Association</p>
<p>(including representatives from Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi,</p>
<p>and Beijing), as well as the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, all expressed their opinions, opposing the lists submitted by the local</p>
<p>election committees, opposing packaged elections, opposing non-vocational group employees participating in vocational group elections,</p>
<p>and advocating free elections. The former two</p>
<p>groups petitioned Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister of Organization Chen Lifu on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>The former group held a meeting in the afternoon. The association decided to ask</p>
<p>the Central Government to reconsider the list, otherwise it would not recognize</p>
<p>the National Assembly representatives elected this year.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] The Hubei Provincial National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, citing the fact that the bandit rebellion has not yet subsided,</p>
<p>telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government again, requesting that the election be postponed</p>
<p>in order to avoid diverting the strength to quell the rebellion.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Selection Methods to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese participating in elections, relevant departments have drafted methods that are expected to be announced within the next two to three days. However, according to Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters Committee, these methods still need to complete legislative procedures in the Legislative Yuan, and the fundamental issues still need to be discussed during the next National Assembly session. Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao stated in a press conference on the 22nd, in response to reporters' inquiries, "Regarding the technical difficulties encountered by overseas Chinese voting abroad, the election affairs authorities are currently considering appropriate measures so that the overseas candidates favored by public opinion can be nominated without affecting the sovereignty of their countries of residence." Regarding absentee voting, negotiations were conducted with the United Kingdom but were unsuccessful because the issuance of ballots is considered an exercise of citizenship rights. Furthermore, conducting elections on naval vessels in international waters is beyond the capabilities of our navy. Therefore, if other countries do not agree, we absolutely cannot force the issue and should abandon the idea if consent is not obtained.</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress of Overseas Chinese Elections in Australia and Other Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, 21st] The preparatory work for the election of one representative to the National Assembly by overseas Chinese in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Fiji, and the Samoa Islands is progressing smoothly. To date, the local authorities have not interfered. Except for New Zealand, 9,875 overseas Chinese have registered as eligible voters in various regions.</p>
<h3>Public School Principals Participating in Legislative Yuan Elections; School Location as Duty Station</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the question of whether principals of national universities or public secondary schools and above should resign to participate in the Legislative Yuan elections, the Election Headquarters has clarified that participation in elections in areas outside the school's location does not require resignation. The rationale is that principals of national universities or public secondary schools and above are civil servants appointed above a certain level and cannot be considered officials as defined in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan's Election and Recall Law. However, for the application of the same article, only the school's location is considered their place of duty, and there is no so-called jurisdiction. If they are candidates for Legislative Yuan in areas outside the school's location, they are not subject to the restrictions of the same article.</p>
<h3>Strike Once Occurred in Wuhu due to Disputes over Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 22nd] Shops on Wuhu's Chang Street closed down this morning in protest of tax collection.

This morning, when tax inspectors arrived at the Yu Cheng Fabric Store and the Gong Mao Yarn Company, disputes escalated into physical altercations. Three tax officials in the Gong Mao Yarn Company were injured with bleeding head wounds. Wu Junhua, the young owner of the Yu Cheng Fabric Store, was arrested by tax police but was rescued by over a hundred merchants in the street, leading to the strike. After negotiations between Wuhu County Magistrate Mi Shiheng and local gentry Gao Shouheng and others, a solution was reached, and the shops resumed business in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 21st] Even before the wheat ripened this year, merchants from Tianjin came to Sui with liquid capital to purchase unripe wheat. At that time, the provincial government strictly prohibited it. Now that the wheat is on the market, the buyers are demanding one shi of wheat from the sellers for every 100,000 yuan of advance payment, which is 250,000 yuan cheaper than the market price. Chairman Dong Qiwu, to support farmers and prevent hoarding, specially telegraphed to all commissioners and instructed all counties to allow sellers to refuse to deliver the grain.

<h3>Reflections of the World YWCA Delegates: The Mus Family; Low Status of Women in Mexico; Our Hangzhou Correspondence; Special Correspondent Hong Xucai</h3>
<p>Among the Mexican delegates attending the World YWCA Conference in Hangzhou, besides the local president, Mrs. Angeles, were Mrs. Mus and her daughter, who were beautiful, active, and attracted much attention. Mrs. Mus looked no more than thirty years old, while her daughter had already grown into a graceful young woman. Mrs. Mus and her daughter came together, becoming the youngest and most beautiful representatives at the conference.</p>
<p>This was their first time in China, and their impression of Hangzhou was: peaceful, beautiful, elegant, and refined. Miss Mus complained that the conference schedule deprived her of the time to tour West Lake. She said, "The car was driving by the lake, and I really wanted to jump in!"</p>
<p>Both Mrs. Mus and her daughter were talkative. When recounting the customs and traditions of Mexico to reporters, they gesticulated and spoke eloquently.</p>
<p>They described Mexico as having a beautiful environment, a good climate, and not having suffered fatal blows from the World War. The influence of the United States was very great on them, and the people imitated the United States in every way. This trend became more pronounced after the war. Mexicans love to sing, dance, and enjoy life in a relaxed and romantic way. However, the status of women is pitifully low.</p>
<p>Mexican marriage laws have an explicit provision stating that if a husband discovers that his wife has committed adultery, he can kill her on the spot as long as he can provide concrete evidence. Therefore, wives all abide by the way of women, and no one dares to joke with their lives.</p>
<p>Then, what about the husbands? Although the law stipulates that each man is only allowed to marry one wife, very few are willing to comply. Most husbands cannot be satisfied with just one wife. In addition to a legitimate wife at home, mistresses outside are always inevitable. Over time, this custom has simply become a tacit right for Mexican men. The prevalence of this situation is even greater than in China.</p>
<p>The basic reason for allowing this unreasonable phenomenon to exist is still the low status of women. Women are discriminated against everywhere in society, making it impossible for most women to support themselves. Leaving their husbands would immediately become a problem, so everything has to be endured. Moreover, because Mexican men have such powerful patriarchal rights and finding a new wife is easy, men are unwilling to marry divorced women. Furthermore, divorce procedures in that country are particularly difficult, so most wives mostly endure and rarely seek divorce.</p>
<p>The disparity between rich and poor classes in Mexico can be fully demonstrated in wedding ceremonies. Most people there are Roman Catholic, and weddings are held in churches. The wealthy class often goes to great lengths to be extravagant, with grand ceremonies and etiquette, and lavish dinners and receptions, spending thousands of dollars in one night without hesitation. And those who are poor only have the simplest refreshments. Mexican weddings are either very rich or very poor, and there is never anything in between.</p>
<p>They have a unique custom in their weddings: all the expenses for the dinners and receptions are borne by the bride's family. At the same time, before the wedding, the bride has to hold a tea party to say goodbye to her close female friends. Only female friends are invited, and men are not allowed to participate. When these female friends attend the party, each must bring a gift. Most of these gifts are predetermined in scope. For example, if it is decided that it is for the kitchen, everyone will prepare various utensils for the kitchen. On the day of the farewell party, they will bring a complete set of kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>Women from relatively wealthy families are unwilling to work outside after marriage, which is also one of the reasons why women's careers cannot develop. Most professional women are unmarried. The jobs they take are nothing more than typists, female secretaries, etc. The vast majority work as laborers. Not only are women's positions low, but their treatment is also unequal. The difference in pay between men and women for the same work is enormous.</p>
<p>If you were to summarize Mexican women, they can be roughly divided into three categories: noblewomen, farmers, and laborers. Mexico is an agricultural country, and rural women have to go to the fields to work. Like Chinese farmers, in addition to helping their husbands farm, they also have to manage the household and take care of the children, making their duties more difficult and burdensome than those of men. In addition, laborers in cities struggling on the poverty line are subjected to even greater exploitation than men due to gender inequality. Even those noblewomen who sit at home enjoying happiness seem to be doing well, but to put it bluntly, they are still appendages of men. They have to be cautious, always on guard against being abandoned by their husbands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mus and her daughter are representatives of the Mexican YWCA, and they naturally understand the situation of women in their country more deeply. When they mentioned that women have no equality in politics, society, occupation, marriage, and education, and how sisters in their country suffer in hardship, Mrs. Mus could only shake her head and sigh. And Miss Mus, who is in her twenties, said to the reporter through clenched teeth, "I really hate these men!"</p>

<h3>British Parliament Debate Begins; Eden Criticizes Government's Policy of Compromise; Also Blames Soviet Union for Delaying German Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Conservative Deputy Leader Eden, speaking in the House of Commons during a general debate on the government's plan, said that the government's plan to reduce the power of the House of Lords was purely a partisan policy that could not restore the nation's glory or the people's happiness. Eden also said that the government's reduction of the domestic fleet to one cruiser and four destroyers made the British fleet smaller than even the Peruvian navy, a situation that caused serious concern among the people. Referring to the international situation, Eden said that the international situation had deteriorated since Parliament adjourned in August, and the United Nations organization had failed to make any progress. Regarding Europe, there was the emergence of the new Communist International, the intensification of activities by the socialist parties of Italy and France, and the assassination of the leader of the Bulgarian opposition, Petkov. Britain should now adhere to its beliefs in genuine democracy and freedom, and fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements. Merely compromising with others would not achieve anything. Eden also said that Stalin's recent expressions of friendship when meeting with several Labour MPs were difficult to accept when the Moscow radio station continued to vehemently attack the Soviet Union's allies. Referring to the German question, Eden stated that Germany had not yet been given economic unification, not through any fault of the British government, but because of the actions of the Soviet Union. Britain had been carrying out its work in its German occupation zone in accordance with the principles most conducive to the future peace of Europe. Germany should make the greatest contribution to its own economic reconstruction, but Germany must never rearm and become a threat to peace. Eden, referring to Britain's sale of its gold reserves, considered it an extremely serious event. Eden believed that the response of the sixteen European countries to the Marshall Plan was the most significant international event since August, and hoped that future development would be pursued in accordance with this plan, so that the economic recovery of Western Europe could be realized. But he also said: "It is a serious mistake to rely solely on the assistance of others; we must make every effort ourselves; we must face the extremely difficult situation."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Attlee, following Eden's speech, announced that the government intended to reduce the time limit for the House of Lords to delay legislation from two years to one year.</p>
<p>When Attlee said that this measure was a wise precaution, opposition leader Churchill immediately refuted it, calling it a deliberate act of social aggression. Attlee continued: If the House of Lords has no intention of using its threatening power to obstruct the resolutions of the popularly elected House of Commons, then the government's recommendation to reduce the power of the Upper House will not harm the Upper House.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Expresses Deep Concern Over the Precarious International Situation</h3>
<p>Attlee continued to discuss foreign policy, expressing deep concern over the tense diplomatic situation and the Soviet Union's attitude in the United Nations organization. Regarding the trade negotiations in Geneva, although there were many difficulties, he believed that the majority of the seventeen participating countries would be able to reach an agreement. Referring to the Imperial Preference System, Attlee stated that Britain had no intention of establishing the entire Imperial Preference System. Britain had always remembered to maintain a balanced economic relationship with the Western Hemisphere, and now that it had been able to obtain markets for the export of British and its colonial empire's products, it had always been able to increase the US dollar income of the sterling area. Attlee then discussed the military issue, saying that in the next eighteen months, the military would be greatly reduced. As for the reduction of the domestic fleet, it was entirely temporary. Military personnel would be reduced to a total of 937,000 by next March, a further reduction of 550,000 from the original plan. Attlee acknowledged that the economic situation had deteriorated since Parliament adjourned in August, and the details would be announced by Cripps and Dalton in a day or two. Finally, he said that it was necessary to first straighten things out internally to overcome the difficult period.</p>
<h3>British-American Tariff Agreement Expected to be Concluded This Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 21st] The difficulties that previously arose in the tariff negotiations between Britain and its dominions and the United States due to the divergent opinions of a certain dominion on a certain point have now been overcome, bringing the conclusion of the agreement one step closer. It is reported that the United States and the British Commonwealth are expected to conclude a tariff agreement this week.</p>
<h3>US Assistant Secretary of State Calls on All Countries to Increase Production</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Boston, 21st] Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs Armore said today that the main concern of the United States in its aid plan for Europe is the value of humanity, especially the maintenance of human freedom. He also declared that the basic problem of the European crisis is production. He called for raising the level of world production so that the general public can obtain economic security, political stability, and lasting peace. He said that the goal of US foreign economic policy is to expand trade between countries so that all parties can benefit.</p>
<h3>Dismantling of German Factories Distributed to Allied Countries; Some Equipment Already Shipped Out of Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bad Dinsel, 21st] The Allied Reparations Commission announced that of the 682 German factories in the British and American zones of Germany that should be dismantled, 119 have already been distributed to the Allied countries, and the equipment of some factories has already been shipped out of Germany. The military authorities have also notified the Reparations Commission that there are another 111 factories available for distribution. The Allied Reparations Commission did not announce how many of the remaining 482 factories would be allocated to the Soviet Union. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union can obtain one-fourth of the 682 factories, and the rest will be distributed by the eighteen countries of the Allied Reparations Commission. The lists of all factories have not yet been fully compiled.</p>
<h3>International Bank's Capital Increased by $200 Million</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 21st] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development released its quarterly report today, showing that the bank added $200.06 million in capital in the three months ending September 30, bringing its total capital to $8,235.1 million, of which nearly $480 million is available for new loans. International Bank Vice President Garner delivered a speech in St. Louis on Monday, explaining the International Bank's lending policy, which focuses on expanding production, but its funds are only sufficient to meet the most urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Rockefeller Suggests Establishing an Americas Bank; Aimed at Establishing Trade in the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, St. Louis, Missouri, 21st] Howard, Vice President of the International Harvester Company, said today that once the US government's grant program ends, US foreign trade will collapse. Howard, along with Rockefeller, Mexican Finance Minister Betantai, and representatives of American agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups, jointly proposed a plan that would allow American businessmen to help the world and help themselves at the same time. Rockefeller advocated the establishment of an Americas Bank to establish trade in the Western Hemisphere; Betantai said that American businessmen can only get reimbursed by investing in the industrialization of Latin America. According to Howard, normal American exports are now gradually decreasing, not because other countries are unwilling to buy American goods, but because they lack US dollars to pay. Howard advocated that US tariffs should be drastically reduced across the board, which would not only encourage the confidence of various countries, but also guide them to follow suit, which would help the reconstruction of Western Europe.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Still Brewing in France</h3>

<p>Just as transportation workers in Paris have returned to work, the French Civil Servants' Union, representing 1.8 million civil servants nationwide, has also put forward a request for reclassification, threatening to implement work slowdowns if its request is refused. At the same time, the National Railway Workers' Union has expressed that unless negotiations are resumed, it will convene a national committee to decide on a strike, as the government is unwilling to handle its request for an 11% wage increase separately and is only willing to recognize it as part of the general wage increase request put forward by the National General Confederation of Labor. Postal workers have also demanded an emergency adjustment to the treatment of postal workers before the treatment of civil servants is resolved.

<p>cotton yarn to yarn merchants for distribution, in order to</p>
<p>smooth the source of goods and meet the urgent needs of the market, so that supply and demand can be adjusted and market prices can tend to stabilize. On the one hand, negotiate yarn prices and quickly make reasonable adjustments,</p>

<h3>Sheshan Catholic Church Children's Camp Visits - Selected from Various Educational Institutions - Divided into Seven Groups for Training</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Children's Camp, yesterday</p>
<p>To introduce the work of the camp, a special open invitation was extended to the city's press. The camp is located in the Sheshan Catholic Church in Songjiang. Around 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>they boarded a bus from the Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Federation on Sichuan Road,</p>
<p>and finally arrived at their destination at 11:30 a.m. After a short rest,</p>
<p>they had a simple meal. During the meal, the camp's honorary chairman, Lu Meiseng,</p>
<p>the chairman of the committee, Liu Dewei, Dong Bin, the general manager Cao Yourong, and the director of the document group, Ding Hao, and others, respectively reported on the various aspects of the camp, and</p>
<p>the activities of various children's welfare organizations in the city.</p>
<p>The camp is jointly organized by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Federation and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association and over forty other units. The main purpose is to stimulate children's interest,</p>
<p>and inspire their love for the community and society. Nearly a hundred children are staying at the camp, all of whom are selected from outstanding children from various children's educational institutions in the city, based on</p>
<p>actual ages of twelve to sixteen years old for both boys and girls, with a limit of three to five children per unit. The camp period is from the 15th to the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>The activity schedule for each day has been arranged, and there are small group activities every day, divided into seven groups: literature, nature, society, singing, drama, drawing, and dancing.</p>
<p>Each group is staffed with dedicated individuals to guide the training, in order to cultivate "little teacher"</p>
<p>talents in each group. When each child returns after the camp period, they can</p>
<p>serve as "little teachers" in various children's welfare organizations. The idea is to allow the unfortunate children who have suffered hardships</p>
<p>to have opportunities for recreational activities in addition to work-study.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the camp only raised 30 million yuan in funding,</p>
<p>and all the camp's expenses (including food costs)</p>
<p>must rely on this to maintain, which is quite a strain. Dong Bin, the chairman of the camp committee, continued to describe the difficulties in raising</p>
<p>funds, and the plight of the suffering children urgently needing relief. He could not help but shed tears. He loudly appealed to</p>
<p>society to quickly give the suffering children powerful sympathy. Who doesn't have children? In these difficult times, we should</p>
<p>extend our care to other people's children as we do to our own.</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m., the group of reporters, led by Father Faluo,</p>
<p>climbed the mountain to visit the Sheshan Basilica and the observatory, and returned to Shanghai around 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Yuan today</p>
<p>after being signed by representatives from both the province and the city.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., representatives from both sides met in the Shanghai Municipal Government</p>
<p>conference room. The Shanghai Municipal Government representatives present were Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau,</p>
<p>Chu Bingqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Yu Shuping, Director of the Police Bureau (represented by Sun Jialiang);</p>
<p>Wu Zunyi, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, and Secretary Yang Zhu were also present. The Jiangsu Provincial Government representatives present were Shen Peng, Director of the Civil Affairs Department,</p>
<p>Dong Zhe, Director of the Finance Department, Chen Zimin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Xie Chengbing, Commissioner of the Third Administrative Inspectorate District,</p>
<p>and Huang Sen, Provisional Provincial Councilor. Because of discussions regarding the requests of the people of Xinzhuang and</p>

<p>Zhuang Hongan, County Chief of Baoshan County, Yuan Xiluo, Speaker of the County Council, Xu Jinyu, County Chief of Songjiang County, Liu Jin, County Chief of Qingpu County, Sun Zaishi, Speaker of the County Council, Xu Zhuyi, County Chief of Jiading County, Yang Zhuofu, Representative of the County Council, and Shanghai Municipal Councilors Shi Junren, Zhang Xuelian, Zhang Shouxian, District Chief of Longhua District, and Long Yuyuan, District Chief of Xinjing District, were also present.</p>
<p>Xinzhuang Residents' Representatives Petition</p>
<p>First, Director Zhu and Director Shen successively reported on the significance of today's meeting, which was to listen to the opinions of the county chiefs and residents' representatives, so they were asked to express themselves as much as possible for reference.</p>
<p>The representatives then successively expressed their opinions, and both sides argued especially strongly on the issue of the jurisdiction of Zhucun and Xinzhuang,</p>
<p>engaging in heated debates. Zhang Shiqi and others, representatives of the Zhucun residents, requested that they be incorporated into Shanghai. At 3:30 p.m.,</p>
<p>over a hundred residents' representatives from Xinzhuang went to petition, also requesting to be incorporated into Shanghai. Wu Zunyi</p>
<p>and Xie Chengbing received them and told them that the meeting was in progress and promised to submit the public opinion for discussion at the meeting. Another</p>
<p>debate was triggered during the meeting. Finally, Chairman Zhu Ping summarized the opinions of all parties and said that they would seriously consider them. If an</p>
<p>agreement could not be reached, they would convey everyone's opinions to the central government. The meeting adjourned at 5:30.</p>
<p>Director Tian of the Finance Bureau Opposes Subsidies</p>
<p>At 5:45, a formal meeting continued, with only the official representatives of the province and the city present, still chaired by Zhu Ping.</p>
<p>After some discussion, the Jiangsu Provincial Government requested subsidies from the city government for Qibao, Dachang,</p>
<p>and other newly incorporated urban areas. Director Tian firmly opposed this and no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>Finally, it was agreed that the Jiangsu Provincial Government would submit a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government proposed that, in accordance with the wishes of the local</p>
<p>people, Zhucun Township should be incorporated into Shanghai, but the Jiangsu Province representatives could not agree, and it was agreed to submit the issue to the central government for resolution. Also,</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province may agree to the incorporation of Xinzhuang into Shanghai. Other points are listed below:</p>
<p>Boundary Issues May Be Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Boundary Section: Handled in accordance with the Executive Yuan's instructions,</p>
<p>but taking into account the actual situation, the boundary of the Beidachang District is the Yunzao Creek (the Executive Yuan's instructions originally stipulated the Huangni Creek as the boundary), and the boundary of the Hunanshinzhuang District is the Chunchunjiang (the Executive Yuan's instructions originally stipulated the Hengtang as the boundary). The Jiangsu Province representatives said that they may agree to the above boundaries, but because it involves changing the Executive Yuan's instructions,</p>
<p>it must be submitted to the central government for approval. Subsidy Section:</p>
<p>In 1928, the Executive Yuan's instructions designated the city government to subsidize the Shanghai and Baoshan Counties' surtax amounts, based on the average rate of provincial and municipal land</p>
<p>tax conversion rates. From January to December of this year, it is calculated based on the average of 160,000 yuan from the city side and 180,000 yuan from the province side (limited to the actual collection of grain and public grain).</p>
<p>Land Tax Split 50/50 in 1946</p>
<p>Land Tax Section: The land tax for newly划区 areas in 1946 will be collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government on behalf of the province, and the collected amount will be split evenly between the city and the county. In 1947, the land tax will be collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the land registry and grain registers should be transferred immediately.</p>
<p>Public Funds and Assets Section: 1. Public funds and assets belonging to the county shall remain under the jurisdiction of the county government, and those belonging to the district and township shall be transferred accordingly. 2. The original Public Funds and Assets Supervision Committee</p>
<p>should be restored, and personnel should be appointed by both the city and county in accordance with the original plan to form it. Armed Forces Section: Armed forces sections</p>
<p>belonging to the county shall be recovered by the county, and those belonging to the district and township</p>
<p>shall be transferred accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yuan Xiluo Emotionally Kneels and Pleads for Subsidies for Baoshan County</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] When discussing the jurisdiction of Xinzhuang and Zhucun and subsidies for the newly划区 Dachang and other areas yesterday, the city and county councilors, district chiefs, and residents' representatives present</p>
<p>engaged in a heated debate. Yuan Xiluo, the speaker of the Baoshan County Council, who is over seventy years old, also participated in the debate,</p>
<p>believing that in this atomic age, cities should not be concentrated, but should be dispersed to avoid excessive sacrifice in times of war. Shanghai's population is now close to five million, so it is urgent to disperse it and not expand it further.</p>
<p>Dachang is the essence of Baoshan County, and now that it has been incorporated into the city government, it has greatly affected tax revenue and finances. Therefore, please subsidize the county in accordance with the old practice of 1928. Yuan, out of local people wanting profit,</p>
<p>became emotional and actually knelt before Chairman Zhu Ping, weeping and stating that Shanghai and Baoshan Counties are like brothers. Now that the older brother has developed, and the Dachang district has been incorporated into the city government, please subsidize the impoverished younger brother.</p>
<p>He was helped up by the people sitting next to him. However, Tian Yongqian, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, always insisted on opposing the county's request for subsidies for the newly划区 areas,</p>
<p>believing that the Executive Yuan's instructions did not stipulate this point, and that the Shanghai Municipal Government is self-sufficient and often feels strapped for cash, and it is impossible to subsidize the county every year. After repeated discussions, it was finally agreed that this</p>
<p>request from the Jiangsu Province representatives would be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>A Corner of the South: The Voice of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hainan Island by Our Newspaper on the 18th]</p>
<p>Just as chrysanthemums bloom and parasol leaves fall in the north, as west winds carry geese away, and as crops are harvested,</p>
<p>Hainan Island, secluded in this corner of the south, remains lush and green, with picturesque scenery and no hint of cold.</p>
<p>On the streets, robust women still bare their chests and arms, and in the fields, dark and healthy farmers still work bare-chested, sweating and wielding</p>
<p>their hoes, cultivating their hopes. It is fair and sunny, and Hainan Island still breathes "the breath of spring."</p>
<p>Only the Sound of Footsteps on the Stairs</p>
<p>The idea of Hainan Island</p>
<p>being re-designated as a Special</p>
<p>Administrative Region has been brewing for a year, reaching</p>
<p>its climax in July of this year when General Zhang Xianghua, Director of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, carried a restructuring plan to the capital.</p>
<p>However, due to the inability to resolve issues such as military and financial resources, the call for restructuring subsided as General Zhang</p>
<p>returned to Guangzhou via Taiwan. The people of Hainan not only yearn for provincial status, but also yearn for its realization, but all they hear is the sound of footsteps on the stairs, leaving them deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>In August, Navy Lieutenant General Chen Chou, a government advisor and staunch advocate of Hainan's restructuring, and Army Lieutenant General Huang Zhenwu, Director of the News Department of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, returned to Haikou one after another. Both of them are prominent figures in Hainan, and the people of Hainan held</p>
<p>welcome rallies to solicit their opinions on the restructuring.</p>
<p>At that time, the tone of their replies</p>
<p>was earnest and firm, indicating that the realization of the restructuring</p>
<p>was a matter of time. Subsequently, several</p>
<p>newspapers reported various news about the restructuring and published a list of candidates for the various offices of the Special Administrative Chief Executive's Office, creating</p>
<p>an extremely tense atmosphere. At this time, a delegation of reporters from Beijing and Shanghai happened to visit Hainan Island, and the newspapers of Haikou City</p>
<p>unanimously published editorials</p>
<p>requesting the reporter delegation to assist in urging the government to implement the restructuring, in a well-coordinated and seemingly serious manner. However,</p>
<p>soon it was reported that General Zhang Xianghua had indicated that he would not serve as the Special Administrative Chief Executive, and the restructuring issue</p>
<p>began to decline.</p>
<p>Restructuring Still Falls Through</p>
<p>At the end of September,</p>
<p>after the news</p>
<p>of Song Ziwen's appointment as governor of Guangdong was announced, the general public rekindled their hopes for the restructuring.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Song is from Wenchang County, Hainan Island, and before the war, he was very interested in the development of Hainan Island, and had planned to build</p>
<p>a round-island railway. If the Japanese had not launched the war, it is believed that this plan would have been completed long ago.</p>
<p>However, things turned out to be unexpected.</p>
<p>After Song Ziwen took office, it was heard that he did not think restructuring was necessary. On October</p>
<p>13th, he invited prominent figures from Hainan to a symposium in Guangzhou</p>
<p>on local affairs, and the result was that everyone agreed that restructuring</p>
<p>could be postponed, and that a Pacification Zone should be established instead. Chen Chou or</p>
<p>Han Hanying were considered for the post of Pacification Director to strengthen the suppression of bandits on Hainan Island.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, Song Ziwen plans to set up an industrial police office</p>
<p>on Hainan Island, and plans to appoint his personal secretary Lu Wenlan</p>
<p>as the supervising director to preside over the development of industry. In this way,</p>
<p>the hope that Song Ziwen's appointment as governor of Guangdong would accelerate the realization of Hainan Island's</p>
<p>restructuring has fallen through again.</p>
<p>A Stronghold on the Sea Frontier</p>
<p>Originally,</p>
<p>Hainan Island and</p>
<p>Taiwan were both important military strongholds on China's sea frontier. Relying on the fifty years of management in Taiwan,</p>
<p>the Japanese had enriched their domestic</p>
<p>economy because of this. Relying on the seven years of</p>
<p>development on Hainan Island, they also established a base for their southward advance.</p>
<p>Today, Hainan Island is still scarred and devastated.</p>
<p>It can be said that it is still due to the lack of continued</p>
<p>development and construction, resulting in cultural</p>
<p>backwardness, complex public sentiment, obstructed transportation,</p>
<p>and poor public security, and it seems to be becoming a burden to the country, which is very lamentable.</p>
<p>If we hope to erase these lamentable emotions</p>
<p>and make Hainan Island useful to the country,</p>
<p>it is imperative to support it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It cannot be ignored. (Chen Meiqing, sent from Haikou City)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Issues Order to All Counties to Adopt Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 22nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently ordered all county governments to take the following two key emergency measures to stabilize grain prices: Strictly manage the grain market, supervise transactions, and crack down on formal grain merchants who purchase and sell at inflated prices. Send military police to investigate and prohibit grain transactions outside the market and those who hoard grain and refuse to sell, and prevent grain from flowing into bandit areas.</p>
<h3>Absolute Free Flow of Grain Within Jiangsu Province Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties Not to Prohibit Transportation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhenjiang Dispatch] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang [Maogong]</p>
<p>issued successive telegrams to all counties, ordering absolute freedom of flow for grain within the province and to various places in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that some counties in northern Jiangsu often violate the law and privately prohibit the export of grain, and that a</p>
<p>few authorized persons take the opportunity to manipulate and profit from smuggling, which leads to fluctuations in grain prices and affects people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Therefore, he has again telegraphed to all counties, strictly</p>
<p>ordering them not to arbitrarily impose transportation bans.</p>
<h3>Supervising County Administration Inspectors to Depart Soon Key Points of Chairman Wang's Instructions Yesterday</h3>

<p>Zhang Shoukun, Fei Jun, Xie Wencen, Zhang Boyu, Xie Tingbi, Peng Kunzhi, etc. yesterday and instructed them on key points of supervision: Streamlining the establishment of organizations, strengthening self-defense and public security, reorganizing financial revenue, and promoting grain administration and conscription.

<p>ethnic group, so their art is largely the same as that of Central Asian Muslim countries. Their dramas are almost entirely historical song and dance dramas of Arabia. This is the first time in hundreds of years that a formally organized Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe has visited the mainland for sightseeing, so local</p>
<p>cultural figures are eager for compatriots in the mainland to encourage them.</p>

<h3>Completing the Southwest Transportation Network Sichuan Rushes to Repair Three Major Railways</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] In order to cooperate with the central government's five-year railway plan</p>
<p>and build a southwest transportation network, the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Ministry of Communications have decided to immediately start the repair of the Sichuan-Yunnan,</p>
<p>Sichuan-Guizhou, and Chengdu-Chongqing railways. The Sichuan-Yunnan Railway is planned to enter Sichuan from Zhanyi via Xuanwei, Yongcheng, and Dading, and then connect to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway via Xuyong and Luxian to Longchang. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway was originally surveyed to enter Sichuan from Zunyi via Chishui to Xuyong. Now, because the route is too</p>
<p>long and the slope and rise are too large, it has been decided to change it along the Qinghua Highway, passing through Dading to Xuyong, because</p>
<p>the area near Dading is a coal and iron mining area, which is very convenient. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is the most active. The provincial government has urgently summoned 100,000 laborers to assist in the construction. The Fifth District Highway</p>
<p>Engineering Office of the Road Engineering Office stated that the Yongchuan to Jianyang section of the road crosses the highway in as many as 80 places, which has a significant impact on the internal trunk line transportation and it is necessary to divert the road. Recently, Chief</p>
<p>Engineer Li Changyuan was specially dispatched to lead a survey team to Tongnan and Anyue to conduct a field survey. The survey has now been completed. It has been decided to change the original route from Tongnan Tangba to Anyue to connect to the original Chengdu-Chongqing line. If this is done, the journey can be shortened by</p>
<p>62 kilometers, and the railway and highway can run side by side without conflicting with each other. It is estimated that the preliminary work on the Chengdu-Chongqing</p>
<p>Railway will be completed within this month.</p>

<p>a silk quilt, and two pillows with embroidered mandarin ducks.</p>
<p>A small half-table leans against the boat canopy, holding</p>
<p>some teacups and the like. If there are one or two tourists, they</p>
<p>can ask the boat to be placed next to the water chestnut and bamboo in the lake, tied with</p>
<p>a thread, and let the boat girl peel some fresh water chestnuts, or get a few</p>
<p>lake crabs, warm up a few pounds of rice wine, and drink with the girls</p>
<p>in the boat. A good boat girl's boat costs about 20,000 yuan per hour.</p>
<p>An old woman's boat also costs 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per hour. These girls rowing the boats,</p>
<p>however, do not know how to swim, but they are very brave. When the boat is swaying</p>
<p>unsteadily, they do not panic at all. I once asked</p>
<p>them why they didn't learn to swim, and they said, "It's not good for</p>
<p>girls to show themselves swimming in the lake."</p>
<p>South Lake Water Chestnut</p>
<p>Sold in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas, the water chestnut</p>
<p>is large, without horns, delicious, and tender.</p>
<p>Once you've tasted South Lake water chestnuts, no one doesn't love them. Legend has it that</p>
<p>when Emperor Qianlong went to the Mist and Rain Tower in South Lake, he found the taste of the water chestnut</p>
<p>very delicious when he ate it, and he casually sighed that the water chestnut had two horns. Since then, South</p>
<p>Lake water chestnuts have had no horns. Thinking about this story now,</p>
<p>it is really too ridiculous. The production area of water chestnuts is around South Lake,</p>
<p>and the production time is from early summer to early winter. Water chestnuts are divided into tender,</p>
<p>old, and very old three types. Tender water chestnuts can be eaten raw, old ones can be cooked,</p>
<p>and very old ones can be dried and eaten. The taste is exceptionally delicious.</p>
<p>The reporter asked a boatman about the water chestnut news this year. She</p>
<p>said that her family has ten acres of water chestnut ponds and has earned</p>
<p>10 to 20 million yuan in the past two months. The water chestnut business is good this year.</p>
<p>It sells for 2,000 yuan per catty in the market. If you know how to bargain,</p>
<p>you can buy it for 1,000 yuan per catty. Roughly calculated, there is at least</p>
<p>an income of nearly 1 billion yuan. This income is</p>
<p>invested in the Jiaxing market. Another product is</p>
<p>South Lake Crab</p>
<p>Crabs are divided into those caught in traps and those with eggs.</p>
<p>Crabs produced within thirty li of Jiaxing</p>
<p>are considered the best, with a fresh taste, firm meat, and large size.</p>
<p>Female crabs are best in September, and male crabs are best in October. The so-called</p>
<p>traps are made of small bamboo branches woven into a bamboo trap shape, placed</p>
<p>in the river channel. When crabs swim by, they enter the maze and are captured.</p>
<p>If the water flow in the river channel is rapid, the crabs will be larger,</p>
<p>the taste will be fresher, and the meat will be firmer.</p>
<p>The most famous crabs are produced near the Sigu Bridge in Xin-Sheng, northwest of Jiaxing,</p>
<p>but the output is only two dan per day, which is less than the demand.</p>
<p>Other rivers or their tributaries near Jiaxing,</p>
<p>all have crabs. Among them, those produced in South Lake</p>
<p>are exceptionally large, so they are called South Lake Large Crabs. Crabs produced near Jiaxing</p>
<p>amount to about 50 dan per day, at 2 million yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Willow crabs are produced near Jiashan, especially in Xitang, Jiashan.</p>
<p>The daily output is more than 100 dan, and the price is 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Crabs</p>
<p>Cost about 2 million yuan per dan. The price</p>
<p>cannot be discounted, but with a daily output of 50</p>
<p>dan, it is already 100 million yuan. Adding transportation costs, when sold to</p>
<p>customers, it will be over 40 to 50 million yuan. Currently,</p>
<p>the freshest crabs in Jiaxing sell for 3,000 yuan per tael, the next best</p>
<p>for 2,800 yuan per tael, and the next best for 2,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<p>The highest price in Shanghai is 5,000 yuan per tael, and the</p>
<p>lowest is 3,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<p>The best time for crabs is after the cold winds start,</p>
<p>after the Double Ninth Festival, when chrysanthemums are slowly blooming, it is the time</p>
<p>for poets and scholars to hold crabs and appreciate chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Of course, South Lake boats, South Lake water chestnuts, and South Lake crabs all</p>
<p>belong to enjoyment and consumption, but Jiaxing, the place of origin of South Lake</p>
<p>boats, South Lake water chestnuts, and South Lake crabs, welcomes many consumers</p>
<p>to invest. Like this year's liveliness, with so many tourists, there is</p>
<p>at least an income of nearly 10 billion yuan, so the Jiaxing market</p>
<p>has revived again. We hope that the people of Jiaxing will make good use of</p>
<p>this fund and do more to revitalize local construction projects. (Special correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Coal Fee Problem Solved for Northern Universities - Tianjin and Peking Advance Payments from Four Banks - Northeast Loaned Locally by Headquarters - Northwest Loans in Progress</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd) The Ministry of Education had previously allocated</p>
<p>winter coal fees to Northern universities. This year, the Ministry of Education has requested the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of</p>
<p>the amount of coal needed for higher education institutions in the North this winter. However, the weather in the North is cold early, and waiting for the Executive Yuan to approve the entire case</p>
<p>and allocate funds would be too late, and prices are rising monthly, so it is necessary to raise funds in advance. Previously, when</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and Executive Yuan President Zhang inspected Tianjin and Peking, the authorities of the universities in Tianjin and Peking made requests in person,</p>
<p>and submitted budgets showing the number of students and staff and the amount</p>
<p>of coal needed. President Zhang immediately issued an instruction that</p>
<p>the winter coal fees for higher education institutions in Tianjin and Peking should be processed immediately. Therefore, the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>first guaranteed a loan of 7.2 billion yuan from the Four Banks to be used for the coal</p>
<p>fees of higher education institutions in Tianjin and Peking. When the Executive Yuan approves the entire case and allocates the coal</p>
<p>fees, the loan will be deducted. It is reported that in Peking, Peking University</p>
<p>President Hu Shih presided over a meeting of higher education institutions in Peking to discuss distribution and lending methods, and</p>
<p>reported to the Ministry of Education for a guaranteed loan. In Tianjin, Nankai</p>

<p>bank to the Ministry of Education for processing. In addition, the Northeast</p>
<p>authorities were requested to provide loans to higher education institutions in the Northeast based on the</p>

<p>negotiated with the Four Banks by the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Match - Kitchee Defeats Star Island - Return from Overseas Tour Suffers Unprecedented 7-2 Defeat</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch from Hong Kong) In the blink of an eye,</p>
<p>it's the weekend again, and there are four football league matches on Saturday alone.</p>
<p>The football scene is chaotic, and football fans are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Let's first look at today's results and then at tomorrow's Star-Kitchee match.</p>
<p>South China - Cross-Harbor Victory</p>
<p>Saturday, 18th,</p>
<p>both teams</p>
<p>from South China</p>
<p>won. The Bus Company</p>
<p>defeated the Navy 4-1 at the Navy stadium.</p>
<p>Although the team won,</p>
<p>the Bus Company didn't play well enough.</p>
<p>The reason for the victory is that the Navy's strength is too low.</p>
<p>I think that although the Bus Company has considerable</p>
<p>strength this year, they will inevitably be frustrated.</p>
<p>South China crossed the harbor to challenge the Police at the</p>
<p>Police stadium. The Police were lined up to face the enemy. As a result, Chen Dehui</p>
<p>scored three goals, winning by three goals against the Police. The declining South China</p>
<p>is gradually coming back to life. In two internal battles between foreign soldiers, Devon defeated the Air Force 4-1, and St. Joseph also defeated Hong Kong Club 3-1.</p>
<p>Eastern - Draws with Kwong Wah</p>
<p>Sunday, 19th, the Star-Kitchee match</p>
<p>absorbed all the fans, and the other</p>
<p>two matches became unpopular. Eastern</p>
<p>has been determined to reorganize its lineup this year,</p>
<p>and recently recruited Zhu Yongqiang to join,</p>
<p>but unexpectedly, they were held to a draw by Kwong Wah, the weakest team in the Chinese League,</p>
<p>losing five points in total. Although they have the desire to win the championship, the overall</p>
<p>situation is difficult to reverse. The game was decided by two penalty kicks,</p>
<p>each team getting one, resulting in a one-to-one draw.</p>
<p>In a battle between foreign soldiers, Yannis defeated the Artillery 5-2.</p>
<p>Causeway Bay - Stadium Full</p>
<p>The most eye-catching</p>
<p>Star-Kitchee match was held at</p>
<p>the Navy stadium in Causeway</p>
<p>Bay. Fans flocked to the stadium, and the gates were already closed and the stadium was full by 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Star Island's overseas players are now playing</p>
<p>for Star Island and Kitchee this year. Kitchee is currently</p>
<p>leading the league undefeated, and Star Island's match</p>
<p>is their first after returning from their tour of England. Everyone thought there would be a</p>
<p>fierce battle, but unexpectedly, it was a one-sided affair, and Star Island</p>
<p>suffered a crushing 7-2 defeat. The lineups at the start of the match were:</p>
<p>[Kitchee]</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongyun - Hou Weicheng</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng - Song Lingxing - Liu Qingcun</p>
<p>Jing - Li Zhaorong - Guo Yingqi - He Yingfen - Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>[Star Island]</p>
<p>Yu De</p>
<p>Liu Tianshen - Zheng Ying</p>
<p>Shan Yousheng - Xu Jingcheng - Li Dian</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting - Feng Jingxiang - Wei Huanzhang - Zhang Jin - Li Zhongxian</p>
<p>Star Island - Mistake and Abnormality</p>
<p>Looking at the lineup,</p>
<p>Star Island used Dian</p>
<p>Qi and Fang</p>
<p>Sheng as central defenders. It was clear that they would lose due to the poor arrangement of the lineup.</p>
<p>In addition, the entire team played abnormally, and Zheng Yingquan was injured at the beginning of the match,</p>
<p>making the unstable defense even weaker. The defeat was the result of "abnormality" and "mistakes".</p>
<p>Because Star Island didn't play as well as expected,</p>
<p>Kitchee, of course, played well, attacking from the defense line in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Forcing Star Island to defend was the most powerful link in securing the victory, and Zhaorong's shot,</p>
<p>which was powerful and cunning, certainly made the goalkeeper tremble.</p>
<p>Second Half - Complete Rout</p>
<p>At the start of the second</p>
<p>half, before Star Island</p>
<p>and Kitchee had a chance to stabilize themselves,</p>
<p>Wei Huanzhang scored first. Zheng</p>
<p>Yingquan was injured again. Kitchee</p>
<p>took the opportunity to counterattack, and Guangsen's long shot was successful, tying the score at</p>
<p>1-1. At this time, Star Island retreated completely,</p>
<p>and although Kitchee attacked a lot, they only circled within the Cai area.</p>
<p>Finally, Huanzhang received a wonderful pass from Jingxiang, but his lob shot turned into a wild ball.</p>
<p>The first half ended in a tie.</p>
<p>In the second half, as soon as the game started, after Zhaorong scored two goals,</p>
<p>Yingfen headed in another, and Star Island conceded three goals in eight minutes.</p>
<p>Kitchee took a 4-1 lead in an instant. At this time, Kitchee completely controlled the situation,</p>
<p>and then Yingqi scored again, making it 5-1. The overall situation was set.</p>
<p>Jin Hai then had a chance to break through and scored, making it 5-2. Again,</p>
<p>Yingfen scored, and Yingqi scored a penalty kick from 20 yards,</p>
<p>making the final score 7-2. The entire match was unremarkable, with only shots on goal.</p>

<p>Baseball Team arrived in Shanghai, the capital sports community is actively</p>
<p>preparing a grand welcome to show its welcome to the visiting team.</p>
<p>However, there is a lack of opponents in the capital, so a match is unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>The visiting team will be provided with sightseeing and hospitality.</p>
<h3>Baseball Vanguard Expedition: Coal Corporation and Taiwan Compatriots Alliance Team to Face Fuxing Today at Jiangwan Fudan University Field This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Taiwan Provincial Coal Corporation baseball team played their second match in Shanghai against the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance team, organized by Taiwanese expatriates in Shanghai, at the professional baseball field. The audience was slightly smaller, but the atmosphere remained enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Before the game, Li Weiguang, president of the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance, accompanied by the daughter of Wang Ming, chairman of the alliance's board of directors, entered the field and presented flowers to the visiting team. Xiao Dezong, captain of the Coal Corporation team, responded by presenting a team flag to express camaraderie. The visiting team used their reserves throughout the entire game, ultimately winning with a score of 23 to 3.</p>
<p>Taiwan Compatriots Alliance Suffers a Setback</p>
<p>The game started at 3:30 PM, with Liang Fuchu, Yu Chang, and Gu Degang as referees. After both sides positioned their players, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance started the attack, but were unable to get on base due to the fierce pitching of Lin Jianwei from the visiting team. The visiting team countered, and the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance made numerous errors. The Coal Corporation team took an early lead of 3-0 in the first inning.</p>
<p>In the second inning, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance was powerless, allowing the visiting team's Bai Qingchuan, Xue Yongshun, and Chuan Junnai to safely reach base, resulting in another six points for the Coal Corporation team. In the third inning, the visiting team seemed to relax, and the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance rallied, scoring three points. In the fourth inning, the Coal Corporation team became rampant again, ending with a score of 3-0. Riding on their momentum, they continued to press in the fifth inning, initially leading with a score of 6-0. Subsequently, Xue Yongshun was injured in the ankle and left the field. The Taiwan Compatriots Alliance urgently brought in pitcher Li Tiancheng, but it was ineffective. The visiting team ended the fifth inning with a score of 10-0.</p>
<p>By the sixth inning, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance had completed their attack. Originally, it was the Coal Corporation team's turn to retaliate. However, at this point, with the visiting team leading by a large margin of 23-3, both sides agreed not to continue. The visiting team ultimately won with a score of 23-3, delivering another victory. The game statistics are as follows:</p>
<p>Principal Zhang Yi Throws the First Pitch</p>

<h3>"Pre-Announcement" Import Licenses: Validity Period Extended to the End of This Year; Woolens Excluded, Still Limited to July 31st</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the secretariat of the Export-Import Control Committee: It has been found that for various goods ordered by importers before November 17, 1946, that have not yet been declared and imported, and that meet the various conditions stipulated in the Executive Committee Announcement No. 1 of the former Export-Import Control Committee, "Pre-Announcement" import licenses have been issued separately. However, it was stipulated that all goods must arrive by the end of June of this year, so those arriving in July were refused import by customs or sealed in warehouses. In order to expedite the processing of these imported goods, the committee has now decided on a flexible approach: 1. The validity period of previously issued "Pre-Announcement" licenses is extended to the end of this year, except for woolens, which are subject to separate regulations. (For goods listed in the attached table that still cannot be shipped by the end of this year, a valid supporting document must be prepared and sent to the committee to apply for a "Post-Announcement" import license.) 2. The letter of credit for the "Pre-Announcement" license referred to in the preceding paragraph should be (A) opened before March 1, 1946, and all foreign exchange cleared; or (B) opened before November 17, 1946, and all foreign exchange cleared, or expired without extension, but sold back to the designated bank and definitively paid with foreign deposits before February 17, 1947, with proof. 3. For "Pre-Announcement" licenses for woolens, where the payment has been fully made before February 14, 1946, with conclusive proof, the validity period is extended to July 31st of this year. 4. Any discrepancies between the quantity and value stated on the "Pre-Announcement" license and the goods, or any discrepancies between the starting and ending dates filled in the application and the actual shipping date, shall be handled by the competent department of this committee.</p>
<h3>Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution: Outline Agreed Upon Yesterday, Chairman Liu Takes to Nanjing for Discussion by the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the joint cotton yarn distribution measures. Review committee members Chu Weijing, Jiang Dixian, Wang Qiyu, and Tang Xinghai attended, as well as representatives from the six cotton spinning associations: Liu Pi, Han Zhiming, Shao Baohu, Zhang Wenkui, Yuan Guoliang, and Zhu Fugu. The meeting was chaired by Liu Siying. First, each of the attending representatives reported on the opinions of private factories regarding the joint distribution measures, which lasted until after 7:00 PM, when the attending representatives first withdrew. Discussion then began, and five points were decided: Establish the outline of the joint distribution measures for general cotton yarn. The joint distribution measures are national in scope, but will first be piloted in the Shanghai area. The original finished product transportation and sales small paper meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be renamed the Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution Committee. Production yarn from both national and private yarn factories will be allocated based on Textile Adjustment Committee documents. The Distribution Committee will, each month, review the cotton yarn needs in various regions and their actual sales situation, and create an allocation budget table for distribution purposes. The approved outline of the distribution measures has been taken to Nanjing last night by the chairman of the committee, Liu Siying, and will be presented for discussion at today's meeting of the National Economic Commission.</p>
<p>It is heard that the joint cotton yarn distribution measures consist of nine articles, the main outline: Organize a cotton yarn joint distribution committee, with all agencies and legal entities related to yarn and cloth to be invited as members. All yarn production from both national and private yarn factories must be sold with the documentation of the distribution committee. Distribution will temporarily be limited to cotton yarn, with priority given to the replication industry, followed by yarn merchants. According to a person in charge of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the joint cotton yarn distribution measures are a fixed government policy and will be implemented inevitably. However, the government is determined to implement a reasonable distribution policy, and will absolutely not harm the production of each factory, and the price of cotton yarn, will especially ensure that manufacturers receive legitimate profits as a prerequisite. Therefore, before implementation, opinions from private factories are being solicited first, to prove the authorities' determination to seek the rationalization of distribution measures.</p>

<h3>Hua Shares Once Moved Upstream, Finally Closed Lower</h3>

<h3>New Aesthetics</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Written by Cai Yi, Published by Qunyi Publishing House</p>
<p>Having let go of the author's "New Art Theory," one should then read his "New Aesthetics." Consequently, I introduced "New Art Theory," and I must also introduce this "New Aesthetics."</p>
<p>From the title, it is evident that it stands in opposition to the old aesthetics. This is because the old aesthetics have completely exposed their contradictions, making it necessary to establish a new aesthetic system with new methods.</p>
<p>What is the old aesthetics? In his methodology of aesthetics, he points out: first, the metaphysical school of aesthetics, which relies entirely on conscious self-reflection to grasp the essence of beauty. The propositions of Baumgarten, Kant, Croce, and even Fechner, which advocate grasping the essence through sensation, and those of Plato, which advocate grasping the essence of beauty through ideas, and those of Colm and Schopenhauer, which advocate grasping the essence of beauty through emotion, all fall into this category. Second, the psychological school of aesthetics, which is the opposite of the metaphysical school of aesthetics in terms of aesthetic method. It does not start from metaphysical philosophical thought but from psychological experience. On the one hand, it rejects the speculative and reflective methods of subjective consciousness and adopts experimental methods. On the other hand, the objects it examines are still the activities of subjective consciousness, and the phenomena are determined based on subjective consciousness. It is also divided into: the pure psychological school of aesthetics, which focuses on the investigation of the conscious activities of aesthetic feeling; and the experimental school of aesthetics, which focuses on the investigation of aesthetic phenomena. Third, objective aesthetics, which examines beauty from art. Taine, Herder, and Guyau advocate studying the basic forms of art from a social perspective. Grosse advocates studying art from an ethnological standpoint. Allan, Spencer, and Cross advocate focusing on the investigation of individual artistic impulses from an evolutionary standpoint.</p>
<p>This "New Aesthetics" lies in the criticism that: "Examining beauty from subjective consciousness, or only examining beauty from art, but the beauty of art is created by subjective consciousness, and the aesthetic feeling of subjective consciousness is a reaction to objective beauty, so the results are all failures" (page 16). It points out that the path of new aesthetics is: "Beauty lies in objective reality, the beauty of reality is the root of aesthetic feeling and the root of artistic beauty. Therefore, the correct path of aesthetics is to examine beauty from reality and grasp the essence of beauty" (page 17).</p>
<p>The entire field of aesthetics can be divided into three aspects: one, the existence of beauty—objective beauty; two, the cognition of beauty—aesthetic feeling; three, the creation of beauty—art. The existence of beauty is the most fundamental thing. In the old aesthetics, aesthetic feeling and beauty are often confused, and many contradictions are discovered. The author makes a serious criticism of the contradictions of "subjective beauty" theorists such as Fechner, Lipps, Kant, Croce, and Zhu Guangqian, who is famous in our country for his "Literary Psychology," and objective idealism aestheticians, and establishes that: "Beauty is objective, not subjective; the reason why beautiful things are beautiful lies in the things themselves, not in our conscious activity. However, objective beauty can be reflected by our consciousness and can arouse our aesthetic feeling. And the correct source of aesthetic feeling lies in the beauty of objective things. Aesthetic feeling that occurs without objective beauty as a basis is incorrect, false, and even morbid... Beautiful things are typical things, that is, things in which the general is manifested in the individual; the essence of beauty is the typicality of things, that is, the general of the species is manifested in the individual" (page 68).</p>
<p>Regarding the recognition of beauty, that is, the question of aesthetic feeling, the author reviews old theories such as: the intuitive theory of form, the theory of psychological distance, the theory of aesthetic attitude, the theory of emotional transfer, the theory of internal models, and the aesthetics of other physiologies, and points out the correct process and characteristics of the recognition of beauty, and the nature and source of aesthetic feeling. The author believes that: "Aesthetic feeling is originally changing, and the relative discontinuity is a major opportunity for the change of aesthetic feeling" (page 170).</p>
<p>"Beauty is objective, but it can be reflected by our consciousness. The so-called beautiful thing is a thing in which the species' attribute conditions are more dominant than the individual's attribute conditions, that is, the "general appears in the individual" and the type" (page 171). This is the author's basic definition of beauty. From this definition, the types of beauty are distinguished, divided into simple beauty, individual beauty, and combined beauty. The so-called simple beauty refers to the beauty of form, sound, color, Qi, taste, temperature, and hardness. The aestheticians of the past who advocated form attached great importance to it, and believed that simple beauty was everything of beauty. Individual beauty must have its due simple beauty, but it is not a collection of simple beauties. At the same time: individual beauty is neither biased towards form nor biased towards content, but a good match between content and form. It evokes a strong aesthetic feeling, but it is not a super-fast feeling. Realistic artists pay great attention to it. Comprehensive beauty is the inevitable correlation of individuals, and the more dominant the general attribute conditions of the species, the more beautiful it is. Idealistic aestheticians in the past paid great attention to it, and believed that comprehensive beauty was everything of beauty.</p>
<p>At the same time, beauty also has a second classification method, namely natural beauty, social beauty, and artistic beauty. Natural beauty is non-artificial and has nothing to do with human aesthetic recognition; social beauty is artificial and has nothing to do with human aesthetic recognition; artistic beauty is artificial and produced based on human aesthetic sense. Therefore: artistic beauty is generally higher than natural beauty or social beauty.</p>
<p>Since beauty has such types, the types of aesthetic feeling naturally also have their differences. When the object of beauty is combined with the concept of beauty, aesthetic feeling occurs, and at the same time, various accompanying conditions of sensibility, intellectuality, and emotion occur. Conversely, various different aesthetic feelings are caused by these accompanying conditions. This is the difference in the form of aesthetic feeling, which can be divided into majestic aesthetic feeling and delicate aesthetic feeling, and tragic aesthetic feeling and comic aesthetic feeling. Psychologically speaking: majestic aesthetic feeling is a mixed emotional activity of contradictions, and delicate aesthetic feeling is a harmonious mixed emotional activity. Tragic aesthetic feeling is expanded from majestic beauty. Because the stimulus of the beautiful object is strong, it causes an inverse mental response, which is not only a vague feeling of tension and excitement, but also a distinct sadness. Similarly, the aesthetic feeling of comedy is expanded from the delicate beauty. Because the stimulus of the beautiful object is softer, it causes an aesthetic feeling accompanied by a vague mental response.</p>
<p>Art is the creation of beauty, and since beauty has such a classification, art can of course also be</p>
<p>Aestheticians and art theorists have traditionally classified art in three ways: one, classification of time and space; two, classification of still and moving; three, classification of formative and musical. This classification method seems feasible on the surface, but none of them touch the essence of art. Because the essence of art is: "What is the essence of art? We know it is the beauty of art, that is, the beauty of reality reflected by art, the typicality of reality. The source of the beauty of reality, the typicality of reality, is strengthened by artists and created into the beauty of art" (page 249). Therefore, the types of art should be divided according to the types of beauty of the objective things reflected by art, that is, the art of simple beauty, that is, music, architecture, dance, patterns, etc., which are biased towards form; the art of individual beauty, that is, painting, sculpture, which are biased towards the harmonious unity of form and content; the art of comprehensive beauty is literature, drama, and comprehensive beauty is</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is higher than individual beauty, and social beauty is also comprehensive beauty.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Higher Mathematics for Physics and Chemistry"</h3>
<p>— Li Zonghai</p>
<p>First edition, May 1947, Commercial Press</p>
<p>Translated and compiled by Xu Xiejun</p>
<p>Original work by J.W. Mellor</p>
<p>Higher mathematics is a necessary tool for studying natural sciences. The properties of objects in the natural world are constantly changing, and only the laws of higher mathematics can be used to study this ever-flowing phenomenon. For example, differential calculus can investigate how natural phenomena change from moment to moment, and ingeniously use limit ratios to express the rate of change of any uniform and continuous change in an instant. Integral calculus can derive the laws governing the entire process of change from the known properties of natural change in an instant. Infinite series provide an approximate concept of natural change, supplementing the inadequacy of other methods. Analytical geometry can express natural change in geometric figures. All of this proves that to study natural sciences, one must have a deep understanding of higher mathematics; in particular, one must have a clear understanding of how higher mathematics is applied to natural sciences.</p>
<p>However, most common mathematics textbooks only focus on the description of mathematical theory, and do not provide detailed explanations of its application in natural sciences. Students who have learned it can only solve mathematical problems, but cannot understand the relationship between natural phenomena and the pure abstractness of formal mathematics, and cannot discover the complementarity between mathematical methods and natural changes. Therefore, they cannot understand the ultimate meaning of theorems or equations in science that have a mathematical basis, as well as problems solved by applying mathematical laws, and only have a superficial understanding. It is even more impossible to use mathematical laws to study natural phenomena. From this point of view, a mathematics book that takes natural science as a starting point and can describe in detail how mathematical laws are applied to the study of natural phenomena is indeed what beginners in science need. The "Higher Mathematics for Physics and Chemistry" recently published by the Commercial Press is a mathematics book that takes natural science as a starting point. The original author, Mellor, explains several famous natural changes in this book, which is the greatest advantage of the book. This not only allows readers to understand the close relationship between mathematics and science, but also, from the standpoint of a mathematics book, it avoids the old method of teaching mathematics by applying abstract problems. For example, the meaning of the differential coefficient and the limit ratio is described by the speed of chemical reactions, the law of compound interest in nature is derived from the method of finding the differential coefficient of exponential functions; discontinuous functions lead to Mendeléev's work on the existence of hydrated substances in solutions; the law of mass action leads to a detailed study of the steps of integral calculus; the equation of motion of objects is the basis for studying second-order differential equations; the work of Harcourt and Esson introduces the study of simultaneous differential equations; Fourier series is applied to diffusion, and so on. After reading this, readers should have a deep understanding of the method of applying mathematical principles to the study of natural phenomena.</p>
<p>The original book is divided into eleven chapters: Differential Calculus, Analytical Geometry, Functions with Singularities, Integral Calculus, Infinite Series and Their Uses, Solution of Numerical Equations, Solution of Differential Equations, Fourier's Theorem, Probability and Error Theory, Variational Calculus, and Determinants. The exercises in the book are mostly taken from experimental records in scientific journal articles published in Europe and the United States in recent times. At the end of the book, there is also a collection of formulas and numerical tables, which are very useful for reference. The whole book is divided into two large volumes, about 1,000 pages, and the price is</p>
<p>Readers only need to have read elementary algebra and trigonometry, and have a considerable familiarity with the preliminary theorems of physical chemistry, to be able to read this book without difficulty. The author would like to solemnly introduce this book to students who are just entering university and are interested in studying science.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Revolutionary History</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiruo</p>
<p>Written by Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Published by Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>In the past ten years or so, more than a dozen books on the historical materials of the Kuomintang have been published one after another, some are specialized histories, and some are anecdotes, each with its own characteristics. Anecdotes of Revolutionary History is recently published by Lu Danlin as a continuation of his "Tales of Revolutionary History." This book contains a total of seventeen articles, some of which are textual researches of historical facts, such as the establishment of the Xingzhong Association in Honolulu and party affairs before the Republic of China, the whole story of the uprising of the Great Ming Shuntian Kingdom, whether Li Yuanhong was dragged out from under the bed, and the actual instigators of the Yunnan Uprising. In terms of literature, there are Poems on Huanghuagang, which write about the poems of more than thirty people mourning the martyrs of Huanghuagang, and the literature of the revolutionaries before the Republic of China, which is an interweaving of narration and commentary on the literature of the party members, which is to put forward its era's sense of justice. Regarding the deeds of the Father of the Nation, there are the second and third things about the President's imprisonment in London, the China Bank and the Revolutionary Party, and the President's handwritten letters from the headquarters. Related to the overseas party history are the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the husband regiment of the officer students, and the New Century forty years ago. Huanghuagang is the sacred place of the revolution, and there is an article describing his surroundings, Huanghuagang in full view. There are also several other articles, all related to revolutionary anecdotes and secret histories.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, Lu has been specializing in the study of modern history, especially party history, so what he writes comes from a different perspective from the hearsay circulating in the market. Each article, each event, has its practicality, because many of the materials in it are unique to him personally, and the conclusions are drawn after a detailed textual research and analysis. For example, the two proclamations of the Great Ming Shuntian Kingdom published by the Literature Compilation Institute of the former Palace Museum are generally regarded as cultural relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, but he textualizes that they are the documents of the uprising in Guangzhou by Hong Quanfu and Li Jidang in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu. Another example is the Yunnan Uprising, which most people say was initiated by Cai E, but he takes out real evidence to say that Cai was only an follower, not an initiator. The Xingzhong Association was established in Honolulu fifty-three years ago, and he found the actual direct information from the only earliest records in the world and foreign newspapers from more than forty years ago. This kind of textual research has its unique points.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo's preface says: "...Lu Danlin is devoted to historical affairs, and uses his spare time to write a book on the anecdotes of revolutionary history. Although the style is not orthodox history, the records are mostly extraordinary news and facts, which historians must adopt and scholars should have... Danlin's book is detailed and cautious in its narration, and its purpose is unbiased. It can be regarded as a good work of this kind, and it should be made public to the world. Moreover, I hope that Danlin will continue to make more contributions to the vice carriage of the national history, so that the true face of the revolution will be clear in the minds of the people, and its contribution to the great cause of nation-building will be no small matter..." Ye's remarks are also very fair and appropriate, so I have selected a few sentences to cross-reference with my comments.</p>
<h3>The Chimes of Justice</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Reading Romain Rolland's "The Wolves"</p>
<p>Romain Rolland's life was dedicated to the struggle for freedom, humanity, and justice. In front of his immortal masterpiece "Jean-Christophe," he wrote that this book was "Dedicated to all free souls in the world who suffer and struggle and will eventually triumph." The upright and indomitable spirit is like a white rainbow piercing the sun, enough to be immortal with heaven and earth! As for the play "The Wolves," it is also one of Romain Rolland's great works. It can also be called a manifestation of this spirit, like a chime of justice, its loud sound shaking the earth.</p>
<p>"The Wolves" is based on historical events during the French Revolution in 1792. At that time, the revolutionary army of France was pursuing the fleeing nobles, but was trapped by the Prussian army in the city of Miennes on the left bank of the Rhine. The revolutionary army confronted the enemy and fought a long siege war, trying its best to break through. The progress of the whole play is steady and serious, tense and enthusiastic; in silence, you can hear the distant sound of cannons and rifles, or the hasty footsteps of soldiers on the street, military music, military songs, commands, etc., and the atmosphere of chaos and turbulence is interwoven.</p>
<p>When the country was on the verge of ruin, the officers within the revolutionary army suspected and were jealous of each other. "D'Avaron" in the play was hated by "Thulié," who was calm and considerate and came from the Society of Scholars, and Commander "Vila," who was brave and violent and came from a pork merchant family, because he was born in the aristocratic class and was arrogant. At this time, Vila took the opportunity to frame D'Avaron. However, the truth of the framed facts was seen through by Thulié, so he resolutely defended D'Avaron for the sake of justice, forgetting his usual hatred, and at the same time demanded that Vila's treachery be tried. Just as Thulié was speaking righteously, Vila won the battle, and all the officers in the colleagues blindly supported the meritorious Vila, forgetting justice. In the end, Thulié was unable to fight alone and sacrificed for justice. The whole play ends here.</p>
<p>After reading this play, we look back at the history of mankind, which has undergone many changes, seas and mulberry fields, unpredictable life and death, just like the greatest drama. Among them, the most valuable thing is the unswerving integrity of justice, but because it is the most difficult to maintain, it is all the more precious and worthy of praise for all ages.</p>
<p>After the Southern Song Dynasty took a partial peace, the world became increasingly chaotic due to the presence of treacherous ministers, and the Yuan army stepped up its offensive. At that time, the government was completely controlled by昏庸 misgoverning the country treacherous ministers, and only the national hero Wen Tianxiang made heroic struggles in a difficult and dilapidated situation. In the end, although he was imprisoned, his ambition did not change. His "Song of Righteousness" explains what righteousness is: "When the country is peaceful, this righteous energy can shine brightly in the court; in troubled times, it can show people's integrity; this righteous energy of integrity will forever be famous in history, and will last forever; together with the mountains and rivers, it will compete with the sun and moon." His ambition and his魄力 have been fully expressed!</p>
<p>Now let us excerpt a few sentences from Thulié's speech in "The Wolves":</p>
<p>"What are we sacrificing our lives for here? Is it for the ambition of a few Jacobin party members? Gesler! The country is using troops for the sake of justice. If the country once violates justice, then what is the difference between it and the lair of the tyrant who wields the same spear? It will be eliminated from the world... Oppressive France will inevitably follow this path. I would rather destroy it with my own hands."</p>
<p>"Everyone, you know how much I hate D'Avaron. Yesterday morning, I even attacked him. But treat an enemy as you would a friend, and maintain your reputation with integrity. If the evidence of his innocence happens to fall into my hands, what should I do? You have to forget the usual hatred and think of a way to correct injustice."</p>
<p>"We should speak from reason. Reason, reason, reason. No one dares to resist when this voice sounds. I obey reason, and if necessary, I can sacrifice my friendship, my hatred, and even my life for it. You also have times when you hear its voice, and you should always follow it. If you want to avoid it, it is extremely tough. It will judge everything...</p>
<p>This is the bone gate of the whole play, and it is what Romain Rolland wants to loudly shout to the world.</p>
<p>In the end, Thulié that heroically sacrificed, just as Wen Tianxiang died calmly, although they died, they can always "leave their loyalty to illuminate history"! They symbolize the upright souls of mankind that have been reduced but will last forever!</p>
<p>At present, the atmosphere of Chinese society is already corrupt. In order to save the decline, we must fight for the sake of justice, no matter how big or small, and do "Unable to be subdued by force, unable to be seduced by wealth, unable to be moved by poverty." If we act on this and create a good atmosphere; if we compare loyalty and righteousness to the sun and moon, and use righteousness to penetrate the rainbow, then we can find a way out for the people of the scarf kingdom. Romain Rolland's "The Wolves," we have recently been able to see Shen Qiyu's Chinese translation, (Shanghai Camel Bookstore edition), which should be worthy of our special attention. Because it just gives us a great warning and encouragement to improve the atmosphere of society.</p>
