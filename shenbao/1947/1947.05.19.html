<h3>國府頒布臨時辦法　安定社會維持秩序　禁聚衆遊行及越級請願</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國民政府十八日令：邇來物價彼動，影響民生，政府正積極籌措有效方案，以期安定，詎意京，滬等地竟有若千學校學生及一部份工商界職工相　集衆請願，迭提過當要求，出以越軌行動，妨害公務，阻碍交通，顯係有意鼓動風潮，擾亂社會秩序，破壞行政措施，長此不戰，將愈使物價波瀾繼長增高，而趨於紊亂，旣這公衆福利之目的，尤貽國家民族之禍害，當　明智者所不忍爲，寅亦政府所難坐視。查妨害秩序與公務刑法及違警罰法，均有明確制裁，除將各有關法律條文擇要公吿，　彭警惕外，並經國務會議第一次臨時會議根據施政方針第十條之規定，通過左列維特社會秩序臨時辦法六條，自即日起公布施行，（一）凡人民團體或學校學生，如向政府有所請求應向當地主管機關呈請，主管機關不能解決時，應候主管機關向其上級機關呈請核辦，不得越級請願。（二）凡人民團體或學校請願時，應派代表向主管機關陳述意見，其代表人數以十人爲限，不得聚衆脅迫，違者應依刑法第一百四十九條之規定，予以解散。（三）各學校學生如有罷課或遊行示威，或其他擾亂公安情事，各該管敎育政機關，應採取必要指施或予以解散。（四）各地人民團體如有罷業罷工或游行示威，或其他擾亂</p>

<h3>爲整飭學風維護法紀　蔣主席誥誡學生　自愛自重勿中奸陰謀</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕蔣主席爲整飭學風，維護法紀，特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>立國之道，首重綱紀，建國之本，全在敎育，必須學校有優良之學風，社會有安定之秩序，而後國家乃有建設之基礎，人民乃有福利之可言。我國八年抗戰，犧牲慘重，戰後復興，備遭艱阻，全賴我全國同胞，共體艱難，認濟事實，守法重紀，各盡天職，乃能完成建設，實現民主，解除我同胞之痛苦，使我中國建設爲現代之國家，而後我國靑年乃不失爲現代愛國之靑年。</p>
<h3>共黨策動學潮　破壞社會秩序</h3>
<p>乃近來各地學生，時有越軌騷擾之行動，及達理逾分之要求，　廢課業，相習成風，假遊行請願之名，爲擾亂治安之舉，甚至佔　車帽，阻礙交通，擾亂秩序，如比干法亂紀，必非我純潔的愛國青年學生之所爲，而顯受反　共軍黨直接問接之策動。蓋共產黨在北方加緊其武裝之叛亂，在各地即加緊破壞秩序，擾亂社會，　　造成無法紀無秩序之無　府狀舉，以　成其奪取政權，　國中　民國之企圖。而其所百　　　，　供利用之工具者，首　　各學校之學生。</p>
<h3>學生應加省察　勿爲奸徒玩弄</h3>
<p>在本年黃花崗革命紀念日，曾爲我全國靑年指出共產黨破壞國家，阻撓建設，及擾亂社會之陰謀。余曾明吿我靑年，以共產黨搗亂吾人秩序，窒息吾人生機，使學生不能求學，工人不能作工之險惡的用心，余今日更欲提起我全體靑年學生之警覺。須知共產黨潛伏各大學內之搗亂分子，正以各種之姿態，利用各種之口號，多方煽動，擴大學潮，以遂行其犧牲靑年，破壞秩序之預定的陰謀。觀於此次學潮之離奇怪誕，爲已往任何時期所未有，我靑年學生即應本其明晰之理智，加以審愼之省察，切勿爲暴亂奸徒所脅制與玩弄，而甘心斷送國家之生命與自身之前途。</p>
<h3>不合理之要脅　政府決不許可</h3>
<p>政府不忍使無辜靑年爲共產黨陰謀作犧牲，亦決不能任令非法行動之蔓延。政府爲整個國家，爲全體人民，負有維護公衆安寗之責任，凡我愛國民衆人人皆有尊重國家法紀之義務，而靑年學子更須愛護國家，遵守秩序。如人民之行動妨及公衆之利益與他人之自由，則其自由即不受法律之保障，而應受法律之制裁。當此戰後元氣未復之時，無論靑年學生與一般人民，一切言論行動，均須以法律與事實爲依歸，尤須以整個國家與民衆利益爲前提；凡不顧國家艱難而爭持少數人一部分之利益，甚至脅迫羣衆，煽動暴亂，以不合法之舉動，爲不合理之要脅者，決非政府所能許可，亦決不能有所姑息。</p>
<h3>公費爲民血汗　不應過份要求</h3>
<p>最近中央大學與金陵大學等校一部份學生，因公費生膳食問題，或因學校本身細故而罷課請願，竟至包圍公署妨害公務，行同暴徒，實已越出常軌。須知各大學公費生之制度，原爲戰事之臨時辦法，戰爭結束以後，本應早日停止，惟因共產黨在各地暴力叛亂，經濟秩序未能恢復，多數學生之家屬接濟困難，政府不忍靑年學業中斷，故仍予繼續，所以體恤淸寒學子者實已盡其應盡之力量。我青年學生，亦須知公費之來源出於人民血汗之負祖，今日我一般貧苦同胞，其食不果腹，衣不蔽體、飢寒困苦之狀况，耳不忍聞，而前綫爲國效命之士兵，其每月所得，乃遠低於公費生膳食費用之數額。自抗戰至今，政府對靑年學生必需生活，無不時刻注意，預爲代謀、故此十年間，一般人民生活雖極端困窮，國家財政雖極端困難，而對我大多數學生，不僅使之免於飢餓，且使之繼續學業，政府實已竭其心力，我靑年學生稍有理智，應不願自視爲特殊階級而作過分與不可能之要求。</p>
<h3>毀法亂紀行動　決採斷然處置</h3>
<p>總之，今日國事尙極艱難，人人應共體時艱，刻苦自矢，而守法重紀，尤爲重要，國家法紀之尊嚴，應爲全體國民所共同擁護，學校爲培育靑年而設置，更應爲一般民衆之表率。最近發生之學生行動，實已越出國民道德與國家法律所許可之範圍，顯係共產黨直接間接所指使，如長此放任，不但學風敗壞，法紀蕩然，勢必使作育靑年之敎育機關，成爲毀法亂紀之策源地，國家何貴有如此之學校？亦何惜於如此恣肆暴戾之靑年？爲保障整個國家之生命與全體靑年之前途，將不能不採取斷然之處置。用特剴切諾誡，務望我愛國靑年，崇尙理智，明禮義，知廉恥，自愛自重，勿爲奸人之陰謀所陷害，而各校當局負有敎育之責者，均應竭盡職責，嚴整法紀，力挽頹風，以保存國家之元氣，維護社會之安寗也。</p>
<h3>敎部擬定計劃　充實各校經費</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕關於充實各校經費曁設備事，據敎長朱家驊稱：復員以來，本部對各校內部之種種困難，深爲了解，多方設法，謀取解決，至對於經常費暨設備各費，無不悉力籌指，惟因受物價波動之影響，各校原領各項經費不敷甚鉅，更增困難，茲又擬定緊急措施，經費計劃，包括外匯，以解決目前各校之困難，政府極爲重視，本部必使此項計劃於最短期內實施。</p>
<h3>臨時國務會議通過　陳啓天長經濟部　僑務委長許世英即履新</h3>

<p>〔本部南京十八日電〕僑委會頃接許世英委員會來電，謂已於十七日離港，十九日可抵滬，略作勾留，即來京履新。又該會副委長以李承新呼聲最高。</p>

<h3>維持社會秩序之道</h3>
<p>近幾日來各地的學潮此伏彼起，情勢至爲澎湃。對於學生的請願，倘使目的純正，行動不踰常軌，而且又復合理，全國的人民及輿論，自無不樂予支持。對於當前的敎育問題，本報曾著論，有所指陳：除同情學生請願的正當目的外，對於學生行爲之有毀法亂紀者，深致其扼腕。不料各地的學潮如今不但沒有消弭，抑且變本加厲。政府對於學生之正當要求，無不樂於接受考慮，原爲愛護靑年；乃晚近之趨勢，却已顯出了踰越正當合理的範圍。南京旣有所謂「喫光運動」的發起，並有結隊遊行請願，甚至將行政院戰員的膳食，也「一喫而光」。各地的學校，多有先後起而遙爲呼應，罷課請願，凡此行徑，國人總不免戚到突兀。當今國步艱難之會，安定第一，已爲舉國一致的要求；，我們自不能讓此種動盪的局勢長此發展下去。爲了確保社會安寗，此種頹風，自必應及早設法息止。我們於此有不能不言的，可以槪括爲下列的幾點：</p>
<p>第一，社會秩序的維持，端賴大衆的努力，學生的罷課請願，其有踰越常軌者，固爲國人所不諒；就是其它一般人民團體，亦不應聚衆要挾擾亂治安，今日各地的請願運動，此起彼伏，花樣翻新，原已越出正當的請願行徑：其目的是很明顯的，就是一方面與政府爲難，一方面在搖惑人心；是其行爲，何堪聞問；人民對於政府如果有所請願，原有正當途徑可循；今日在各地此起彼伏的請願，與其說是請願，無寧說是「要挾」，更何况所取行徑，毀法亂紀；論其性質，實已觸犯刑章，應負刑事責任。旣係「要挾，」我們早就希望政府能够採取較爲嚴厲的措施，來將這股頹風撲滅。此風斷不可長，爲了保全國本。我們早就希望政府能够有所行動。</p>
<p>第二，從法律的觀點論，人民有請願之權，載明憲法；但請願也有正當的解釋。請願決不是要挾，更不是暴亂。假遊行請願之名，爲擾亂治安之舉，尤不爲國法所容許。我們決不能以爲憲法上有人民請願權的規定，而可以濫用這種權利，甚至將國法執在自己手裏。爲了國法的尊嚴，我們萬不能採取姑息政策。此項政策的採取，適足以表示政府的無能。</p>
<p>因此，當我們讀到蔣主席於昨日所頒發的文吿而戚到欣慰。此一文吿的頒發一方面旣昭示政府的如何愛護人民，爲懇切的勸吿，一方面又明白指出，晚近的種種風潮，實爲共黨的一貫陰謀，更表明了政府此後對於此項事件的處理，將採嚴厲的政策，以維法紀，力挽類風，此一表示，適符我們的宿願。同時，國府委員會臨時國務會議，昨又通過維持社會秩序臨時辦法六項，規定凡人民團體或學校學生，應向當地主管機關呈請，不得越級請願；凡有請願情事，應推代表向主管機關陳述意見，其人數以十人爲限，不得聚衆脅迫，違者依法處置：學生罷課或其它擾亂公安情事，各該主管機關，應採必要措施或解散；人民團體罷業罷工或其它擾亂公安情事，應採必要措施或解散；當地政府如有必要並應採取緊急措施。觀乎上列各點可知此樣辦法的制定，其性質似多少與過去所採取的各種緊急措施相似。由於此一辦法的公布，我們希望它能切實執行，以收維持社會秩序之實效。</p>
<p>我們於此又有不得不指出的，就是欲使此一辦法能够收到實效，必人人各就其本位起而協助。靑年熱情揚溢，往往情戚未能克服理智，校長的責任，或學校的責任，便在啟發他們的理智，使他們不致有盲目的行動。這是校長對於維持社會秩序之責。爲人父母者爲家長，也有訓導子女的責任，亦不能將此責任，完全推給學校。至於一般社會，更應發揮正論，明辨是非。亂世應用重典，此古人早已言之。今日而欲維持社會秩序，此點斷不可忽。這是在這一意義下，我們認爲維持社會秩序臨時辦法，不失爲一種合時的舉措。當今國家多故，全國人民，尤宜仰體政府的一番至意，共同起而協助，則社會秩序的維持，當不致爲一種不可能的事。</p>

<h3>希臘爲防止侵略　決與土密切合作　將利用美貸款陸編軍整</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕希臘總理馬克西莫斯頃於本日答覆合衆社所提出之書面問題，其大意略謂：美國貸予希臘之借款，大部份將用以整編陸軍，保加利亞所持之好戰與侵略態度，余仍引以爲憂，但今得美國軍事援助之後，希臘人民已高枕無憂，可以致力於和平工作，希臘今後之外交政策，乃以與土耳其合作爲基本原則，同時美國之援助，大部份亦將用以從事戰後之復興工作。茲分誌各項問答如次：</p>
<p>（問）希臘對於美國貸予之款項，其用途計劃如何？（答）爲恢復國內之正常情形，及應付國外之侵略起見，當先充實吾國之軍事力量，故大部份借款將用以整編軍隊，添置供應設備，使之現代化，俾希臘人民可以安居樂業，致力於和平工作。同時亦將用以購買國家所急需之輸入消耗品，原料及其他物資，…其中約三千萬美元，必需購置糧食，以彌補本年收獲之不足。</p>
<p>（間）土耳其總統伊諾努答覆余之詢問，曾謂土耳其政策之原則，乃在多方面增强與希臘少合作關係，素知閣下過去之行政方針亦然，今請一述對土耳其之將來關係。（答）蔡爾達里斯政府時，余担任外長一職，曾於一九三四年與土耳其簽訂協約，其後希臘政策亦以在多方面與土耳其促進友好合作關係爲基本原則，希臘各界輿論亦素抱消除宿怨，促進友好合作，及和平相守之主張。希臘與土耳其保持密切合作之原則，並非黨派性質之政策，而係希臘國會全體政黨之一貫主張。</p>
<p>（問）希臘對阿爾巴尼亞與保加利亞之領土要求，尚未獲如願，不知閣下將如何求其實現？（答）希臘決不放棄對北伊庇魯斯之要求，此一領土自於一九四〇年經希軍解放後，至今仍未獲與希臘統一，希臘人民對此，莫不引爲一種極大失望，而在該領土內所作之重大流血犧牲，竟未能博得希臘友邦之承認，亦屬憾事。今須先將希保疆界稍加修改，然後始可保障對付保加利亞之新侵略。該國好戰成性，在最近卅年間曾三次無故侵犯希臘，而其目前挑撥性之態度，殆亦包藏將來侵略之禍心云。</p>
<h3>土耳其獲美協助　建現代化國防　全部計劃即將付實施</h3>
<p>〔聯合社土耳其伊斯丹埠十七日電〕美國援助土耳其樹立緊密的防禦軍事機構之計劃，將於下星期實行，着重於交通網之改良，以便現代軍隊之迅速調動。美國發言人稱：初部考慮將爲改良現有設備及建築新港口，公路與鐵路目前無一種設備，能滿足現代軍事需要。例如伊斯丹埠爲土耳其最大港口，現貨船不能直駛港內，必須由駁船在遠處駁運。官方人士力言此種援助，目的在指導土耳其軍隊發展爲純粹防禦機構，而不出以攻擊，結果或將大規模縮編軍隊員額，遠較目前之七十萬人爲少。由此間接改進國家之經濟，使退役士兵從事於生產事業。消息靈通人士稱，自配備觀點而論，土耳其最需要卡車·高射槍砲·平射砲及小型防禦軍器，至於飛機將否在該計劃中受多大注意，不無疑問，因指撥之一憶美元，不擬用於此一方面。</p>
<p>准許美公司開掘油井</p>
<p>〔法國新開社安加拉十八日電〕半官機關「亞克薩姆」報今日載稱：土耳其政府已授權美國某公司，在土國境內開掘油井，倘若發現油源，並不出讓開採權，因土政府反對以採油權讓予外國公司故也。消息靈通人士稱，美國之援助土耳其計劃，不能使土國改變此項政策。按美副總統畢萊士最近抨擊政府之援助希土計劃在覬覦中東油源。</p>
<h3>土政府將實行　肅清極端分子</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社土京十七日電〕土耳其政府爲鎭壓共黨及右翼急進份子，即將實行肅淸工作，幷將仿效美國，組織一「反土耳其活動」調查委會，使之長司其事。據半官方面消息，政府或將先行個別檢舉，然後再對整個政黨實施立法程序。</p>
<h3>希大赦問題</h3>
<p>擬向美提兩項對案</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十七日電〕頃據消息靈通人士談稱：希臘政府對於大赦，將提出兩項草案，（一）游擊隊凡於政府規定日期之前，向政府等投降者，均得赦免；（二）克里特島在佔領期內犯罪者亦得赦免。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十七日電〕頃悉：美駐希大使麥維昨晨會訪晤希臘外長蔡爾達理斯，告以希政府特赦投降之游擊隊，倘與時局有利，美國願予考慮。會後蔡爾達理斯即往謁見國王，報告關於此一問題討論之現階段，旋復出席閣議討論此同一問題。聞美國所供獻之意見，乃主張希政府應採取有效之措施，遏阻恐怖份子之越境活動，但鎭壓叛亂則應寬大從事。美方繼建議希臘應邀請中立國觀察員監視執行特赦措施。</p>
<h3>埃軍事團　訪美使命</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕埃及陸軍參謀長阿泰拉所率埃及軍事團抵美後，此間或傳美國將協助埃及建立近代化之陸軍。最常聞之報告乃埃及軍事國此來，曾與美方談及借款之事，而若干非正式方面則謂，兩國加緊軍事合作，尤其是蘇彝士運河防務之計劃，已在此次談判中安置基礎。華盛頓官方對於前述各項報告，均尚不能予以證實。陸軍部官員聲明埃軍事團此來，僅爲視察美軍事設備，硏究美國練兵方法，及空戰技術。總之埃軍事團此次來美，不論其是否能獲美國具體援助，然其所獲之不明顯的利益當不在少。</p>
<h3>國際復興銀行　計劃發行債券</h3>
<p>目的在充實該行基金</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日專電〕國際復興銀行將於六月或七月向私人投資者，出售二億五千萬美元之債劵，以籌集基金，俾用以貸予各需要國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕國際復興銀行發言人本日證實法國財政部長許曼曾於本月九日致函該行董事長麥克羅提供諾言，表示法國願予國際復興銀行一切便利，以管制其貸與法國二億五千萬美元之用途。許曼之來函，係附於貸款合同之後，該函所言，與勃蘭登森林國際貨幣協定之規定完全相符。據國際復興銀行經濟專家稱：所有國家，凡曾簽署國際貨幣協定，且將自國際復興銀行取得貸款者，均必須同樣提供諾言，予該行以一切便利，以管　莫貸款之用途，　於　際復興銀行之成功，端賴其在美國市塲發行公債而定，故上述條件實爲取得美國認購者之信心所不可缺少者，此一經濟條件純爲技術性質，無論如何不能視爲狂政治上千涉接受貸款國家之內政。</p>
<h3>緬甸火車出軌</h3>
<p>乘客死傷近百人</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播：緬甸東部科密拉地方附近火車出軌，死卅人，傷六十一人，其中二十人傷勢危殆。據非官方消息：在出事地點附近，發見破壞路軌用之工具。</p>
<h3>美蘇混合委會開會期間　禁止韓國民衆遊行示威　韓南行政長官頒佈命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城十七日合衆電〕朝鮮南部民政長官安弟宏頃頒令，於美蘇混合委會開會期間，禁止舉行一切支持或反對託管之羣衆遊行示威集會，此舉顯係針對「反託管協會」而發，蓋該會定於明日舉行羣衆抗議示威遊行也。該協會係由李承晚之三親信領導，李承晚雖否認與該協會有任何正式關係，然該協會之一領袖即爲李氏於去年十一月赴美前不久所組一團體總部負責人。該團體對託管極爲反對，李承晚告記者稱：軍事長官劉區中將今晨邀渠一晤，劉區將軍謂，李氏若不能令明日舉行之反託管示威遊行取消，渠即將辭職返美。李氏告記者謂：渠與反託管協會無正式關係。渠曾告劉區將軍，由於朝鮮人民一般反對託管之熱烈情緒，故任何領袖實無阻止之力。霍奇二級上將，劉區中將，李承晚以及朝鮮其他政治領袖，將於明日集商，是時美方官員諒將作最後努力，以停止上述之示威遊行。記者後就此事詢問劉區中將，渠證實民政長官發佈之命令，但否認渠曾表示辭職之意。</p>
<h3>美對韓國問題　處於有利地位</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城十八日電〕此間美方軍事當局雖極願對蘇作若干所謂「讓步」，以便早日促成朝鮮之獨立，然相信渠等握有三張王牌在手：（一）巨前美國已有一具體計劃，即杜魯門主義，美國建議對南部朝鮮之經濟援助，使蘇聯在朝鮮北部失却面子；（二）目前對混合委員會之重行召開，似已爲全世界所注意，美國當局承認世界輿論目前之傾向，將予美國代表團極端有利之道義上支持；（三）朝鮮北部之生活情况在過表一年業已逐漸趨於惡劣，蘇聯顯然發現其地位難於維持。</p>
<h3>幅射性雲霧</h3>
<p>破壞力勝過原子彈</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕美國著名飛機製造家馬丁頃談稱：現有一種新式武器，其破壞力遠在原子炸彈之上，刻正在美國加以硏究之中。此項新式武器，係爲一種「幅射性雲霧」，由飛機在高空施放擲下，並不發生任何爆炸。據稱：此種「雲霧」發出後或可收回，如同澳洲土人所用之投擲武器然。</p>
<h3>蒙巴頓啓程赴英　出席重要會議研討印局</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里十八日電〕印督蒙巴頓偕夫人·僚屬·及印度革新委員梅農，今日乘私人飛機啓程赴倫敦，預計可於星期二抵達。蒙巴頓返國期間，將由孟賈總督代其行使職務。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕印督蒙巴頓與英內閣印度問題專家之重要會議，將在倫敦郊外四十哩處白金漢厦之首相鄉村別墅蔡克別墅內舉行。國會於耶穌昇天節時按例休假，屆時艾德禮首相當可集中心力於印度問題之研究，而印度事務部大臣李斯托威爾·商務大臣克里浦斯·國防大臣亞歷山大·印度事務部次官漢特森·自治領部大臣艾迪蓀·次官波東萊等內閣印度問題專家，亦母庸參與議會之答辯，俾得專心致力於印度問題之討論。在印督與內閣之各次談話中，均將由艾德禮苜相親自主持。議會定六月二日復會，而印督亦定該日以前返德里，參加印度領袖之會議，故倫敦會談之結果，屆時可望同時在倫敦及新德里宣布。</p>
<p>分治勢難避免　英作最後努力</p>
<p>觀察家認爲印度局勢，已逐漸顯示分治之不能避免，然英內閣方面當然仍圖作最後努力，以給予一九四六年五月十六日英內閣計劃以一最後的機會。一說印督之報告中，曾建議英國於一九四八年六月以前提早退出印度，此說刻猶未能證實。然就本年二月廿二日英方正式宣言觀，退出印度之期無論如何不致在一九四八年六月之後，故關於移交政權方式之協定，務須於今後一年之內成立。職是之故，英閣對六月二日在德里召開之印度領袖會議，予以莫大之注意。</p>
<h3>英蘇將交換物資</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播：此間保守黨及左翼報紙載稱，在今後六個月內英國將與蘇聯實行大規模之物物交換。該報等指摘美國外交政策，謂英國被迫求助於蘇聯云。</p>
<h3>司徒燕生等　抵達舊金山</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山十七日電〕我出席聯合國代表團顧問司徒燕生及我國其他外交官員頃抵此。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾力促各國成立　國際貿易新憲章　美國希望减低貿易璧壘</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國務鄉馬歇爾今日發表「國際貿易　」之開幕獻詞，促請各國就未來國際貿易機構　　成立協定，作爲一大步驟。馬卿稱：經濟衝突與貿易戰爭，不免造成政治分裂狀態。今日各民族間需要團結一致，較歷史上任何時期更爲重要。美國雖在日內瓦國際貿易會議中創設减低貿易壁壘，並同意未來世界貿易機　之最後草案，但大功之成就，端視參加會議之十八個國家全體合作。同時國務院發表日內瓦方面之報告，謂美國已與十五國預定國家中之十國，展開貿易談判。至本月底爲止，日內瓦會議之各國代表間，可望進行一百組單獨談判云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日內瓦十七日電〕美國副國務卿克雷登在返華盛頓之前夕宣稱：渠對於貿易談判進行之情形甚爲滿意。</p>
<h3>德秘密檔案公布　擬與蘇訂停戰協定　但此奸謀終未遂願</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕美英兩國海軍部今日公佈俘獲德國海軍檔案，據稱，一九四三年德國曾希望與蘇聯成立秘密停戰協定，不使西方各盟區知悉，一面蘇聯仍繼續向美國取得軍備租借物費，此項奸謀幸未遂願。檔案內並披露其他眞相兩端：（一）德國曾考慮利用高速長程六引擎新飛機轟炸美國，但在一九四三年七月因「該式飛機爲數不多，恐無效果，反足激勵美國民衆決心抗拒」，終於作罷。（二）德海軍總司令杜尼資要求使用「空軍新武器」（顯指V-1或V-2型火箭而言），在一九四三年夏季襲擊直布羅陀盟軍艦隻，但遭希特勒拒絕，當年即發動犬舉空襲英倫。</p>
<p>關於與蘇聯停戰計劃，曾否遞交蘇聯，事實不明。該節全文如次：「吾人惟有停止消耗東綫兵力，方能希望勝利。截至目前爲止，此事勞及日本，蓋恐日本若在北方作戰，南方兵力勢將削弱，加之，日本或不能徵集兩綫必要給養。日本關東軍百萬名待命備戰，日本顯已深感有插足西伯利亞之必要，蘇聯在經由遠東取得大批物資，故問題厥在日本以參加對蘇作戰爲威脅，能否促使蘇聯接受東綫不宣而停戰之建議，且保守秘密，勿令英美兩國知悉。蘇聯仍當繼續取得美國租楷物資，此事値得犧牲一切，如其不能，則應從速築東部防綫」。</p>
<h3>聯合國新聞小組　今日在紐約開會</h3>
<p>美提保陣新聞自由計劃</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日電〕聯合國新聞出版自由小組委員會，將於十九日在此間開會，會期二週，將討論明年國際新聞自由會議之議程草案。頃美國政府已向該小組委員會提出五點計劃，備作考慮。美國是項計劃，尚爲收到之各項計劃中，包括最廣泛者，其內容乃保證消除各種報紙廣播電影，在新聞採集傳遞及應用方圓之各種阻碍，並要求世界各主要新聞中心之記者，建立自守之道德法則。美國此項計劃，將速同法國所提性質類似，惟較簡略之計劃，同時交十二人小組委會討論。</p>
<p>國際記者組織　將在捷京開會</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十七日電〕國際新聞記者組織第二屆年會，將於六月三日起在捷克京城布拉哈舉行，爲期三天，十五國家代表參加者，將達二百四十人。據此間該組織總部消息，此次會議程中之主要事項，爲　定關於世界新聞自由憲章之實際措置，該憲章將提付明年聯合國發起之世界新聞自由大會討論。</p>
<h3>弗朗哥視察　巴塞隆納區</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社瑪德里十八日電〕關於弗朗哥現在巴塞隆納視察一事，西班牙政界人士皆在紛紛猜測其原因。據有資格方面稱：弗朗哥此行或與巴斯克省最近之工潮有關，或在企圖防止要延至卡泰隆尼省之分裂運動。其他觀察家則謂：此行或爲弗朗哥將對巴塞隆納西南泰魯爾區不穩份子採取描蕩行動之先聲云。</p>
<h3>蘇境發現大鋁礦</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十八日電〕莫斯科電台今日宣布：蘇聯採礦家已在伊爾庫茨克區發現豐富之鋁礦，聞其蘊藏之富，在全世界佔首位。</p>
<h3>美國國會或將停止　對外績作經濟救助　范登堡在參院外委會稱</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕參院外交委員會主席范登堡今日表示俟此次對戰災國之三億五千萬元救濟援助案經國會批准後，國會或將不再批准其他對外直濟救濟援助案。渠向記者表示預料當不致再有其他對外武接救濟之要求。然觀察家則謂杜魯門總統或將再事要求撥款以援助受職爭打擊最甚之國。參衆兩院代表昨已議定對戰災國救濟費額爲三億五千萬元，但附帶建議僅能撥其中之一千五百萬元救濟中國，波蘭，希臘，吳，匈牙利，義大利及特里埃斯特自由區以外之國家。該案尚待兩院作最後批准。</p>
<h3>日社會黨內部糾紛　對組閣前途投下暗影</h3>
<p>〔國際社東京十八日電〕日四黨聯合新內閣之首相問題，經過艱鉅之步履後，至十七日因自由黨幹部會議之支持片山出任首相，及民主黨之隨聲附和，大致已告解決。惟同時另一暗影又復投入組閣工作之前途，即自由。民主兩黨對於閣僚分配問題，尤其部位問題，堅持以拒絕社會黨左派份子入閣爲先決條件之意向，已漸見表面化。爲此，社會然入閣候補人之該黨左派代表鈴木。加藤兩人，數日前曾公開發表與共黨絕緣之聲明，以謀緩和自由，民主兩黨之此項反對空氣，詎兩人之聲明，在十七日之社會黨中執會席土竟掀起重大問題，痛遭黨內左右兩派之責難，故組閣工作前途顯有因社會黨內部糾紛而益趨複雜之可能。現該黨首腦片山。西尾等，正就此事感覺無法收拾。</p>
<p>〔東京十八日電〕日民主黨幹部會議，十七日在首相官邸舉行，就該黨總裁人選經詮衡至十八日最，一致推定蘆田均爲黨總裁，幣原爲名譽總裁，齋藤孝雄爲最高顧問。按該幹部會議曾由黨內全體授權對黨總裁人選作全權決定。</p>
<p>日投降未及兩年　竟提出建軍要求</p>
<p>〔路透社東京十八日電〕日本戰敗僅廿一個月，今日居然已提出設立陸軍及空軍之要求。日外務省某官員最近曾向各盟國人士探詢，對於日本於佔領狀態終止後，設立十萬人之陸軍以接替美軍及其他盟軍任務之要求，將取何種態度。該官員力言此一陸軍，爲維持內部秩序，尤其是防止工潮及走私等所必要。渠指出今年二月間之總罷工，經麥帥一紙命令而未爆發，日本政府若無兵力，決不能予以制止。渠並暗示　本尚需要少數空軍，以巡邏日本海岸防止走私。據悉，盟國政府對此項要求迄猶未有反響。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯發表演說　暢論美蘇兩國關係　謂兩國人民皆不欲戰爭</h3>
<p>〔聯台社華盛頓十七日電〕美國前任國務卿貝爾納斯今日發表演親稱：美蘇兩國關於戰爭之談論太多，關於和平之談論太少。實則兩國人民皆不欲戰爭，惟有政治家之錯誤可以引起另一戰爭，美蘇兩國應各瞭解彼此均不能口授和平條件，命人「不願取即留下」，此種態度在今日並無地位。　在此未臻完備之世界中，固無完備之和平，各大國不宜太固執，美國人民亦不宜求全責備，聯</p>
<h3>傳蘇聯業已組成　德國陸軍百萬人　史達林一旦下令即可開入德境</h3>
<p>〔路透社史都特迦特十七日電〕五分之四之德人均相信有實力堅强之德國陸軍存在於蘇聯境內，祗待史達林之下令，即可開入德國，設立德意志蘇維埃國。此間盛傳在蘇聯境內某處有蘇聯組織之德軍一百萬人以上存在，彼等仍穿德軍制服，佩德軍符號，僅制服上之卍字徵，已代以蘇維埃之鐮刀鐵錘標誌而已。</p>
<p>此等部隊，諒係由賽特利資將軍及前在史達林格勒投降蘇軍之保魯斯元帥部下將官所統率，其武器及配備想係烏拉爾區之蘇聯軍工廠所供給。每一德人均信戰爭結束時，蘇聯境內有德軍三百萬人，前述一百萬之數，即係以此數除去蘇聯政府所公布之德國戰俘數字而得。</p>
<p>自戰爭結束以來，一般人民對謠言之信任，更在報紙電台所傳消息之上，因此前項傳說，竟被大部份之德人信以爲眞</p>
<p>賽特利資將軍之夫人，現居不萊梅東南廿五哩之處之凡爾登鎭，渠對此項傳說當然表示否認。本社記者最近曾訪夫人。據云渠對其夫近况，知悉甚少，僅知其現居離莫斯科四十哩處之將官俘虜營內，其夫定期來信，其所用信箋，並非戰俘所用之正式明信片，其夫飲食供給甚佳，並可不時出外作體育遊戲。渠與保魯斯元帥及另一戰時參加自由德國運動之高級德軍官同居一處。賽特里資夫人又謂：「余夫居在鐵絲網後，根本不知此等與其有關之謠言，事實上亦並無賽特里資統率之陸軍，或外界所傳者乃戰爭末期投降蘇軍參與蘇方作戰之德軍而言，余夫僅爲自由德國運動之領袖，渠欲早日結束戰爭，故曾在電台作宣傳云。」</p>
<p>一般德人除相信養特里資在蘇秘密組軍外，並相信渠曾派遺渠所訓練之德國軍官，隨蘇軍於一九四五年攻入德國，此等人均已在德國行政機構及社會統一黨中担任重要職務。此項傳說當然亦無法證實，但知蘇軍區內之德國警察則確有原自蘇歸來之德國戰俘在內。</p>
<p>合國應彼此平等協商，此非謂其應樣牲基本原則，但請其對於何者爲原則問題，何者爲政策問題，應有賢明之決定。戰爭若果來臨，此非因人民要有戰爭，乃因主持各國政府之人缺乏能力所致，予不信政治家竟致破產。予否認衝突必不能避免。予相信我人能締造和平及維持和平。予亦明瞭此事之困難，惟我人終可與以克服。</p>

<h3>法院橡隻鐘　法警是齒輪　他們正在加緊訓練自己　成爲良好助手發揮效力</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕這幾天，犯罪的案子似乎特別多，者守所裏大有人滿爲患，便是個明　，人們大家計翅着旅行，或者已經倦遊歸來，惟有法院裏的推事，部察官，都爲這獄訟繁興而傷腦筋，其實更忙的倒要算司法警察。地院的查院長比喩得好，他說：「法院像一隻鐘，推事和檢察官是鐘上的長針和短針，司法警察是裏面大小的齒輪，祗要壞了一個，全部就要停下來」。</p>
<p>上海究竟是國際性大都市，尤其是司法機關，祗少要比各地規模宏大，就說本市地院的司法警察吧，一共有一百人，分作七班，輪流分担，北浙江聞地　及薛劉立路地檢處的所有工作，院方的工作比較單純而輕鬆，檢察處工作則繁重而有技術性的。在檢察制度完善的國家，檢察官的權力高於一切，法警便是檢察官的助手，他們負責刺探，偵察，警衛和執行，他們也就是具體的與罪惡捧門者。</p>
<p>自憲法制定以來，中華民國已跨上民主大道，爲要保障人權，檢寨制度，已經確立，努力訓練檢察官的助手，亦爲當務之急。本市地院的法警已經在加緊這個準備工作，他們趁每天工作之餘，拼命學習刑民程序法，拘提法，及偵探學等科目。健全的組織，能發揮高度的工作效率，地檢處的法警，單就分送傳票，處分書每天要一千件以上，但是在分工合作的努力下，他們還綽有餘暇來研究學術科目，及組織足球隊，籃球隊，來鍜鍊身心。同時我們還布望地院現有的法警，不以此自滿，未來民主法治的中華民國，還迫切的需要你們呢！</p>
<p>司法界向來清苦，司法警察當然不能例外，現在他們的正薪是十七萬元，加上福利金，津貼等每月也不過二十萬元左右，所以地院的法警還是「光棍」的多，實在負担不起家庭。</p>
<h3>議長視察　滬東四區</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長，昨日再偕項秘書長及衛生·工務二局代表，分別於上下午視察提籃橋·楡林·楊樹浦及新市街區。當議長訪問各區時，均有各區區長，區民代表大會主席，及各該區參議員熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>議長昨赴提籃橋時，曾參觀該處猶太難民區，同時對於該區公平路路面破壞甚多，希望當局能速加修理。至楡林區參觀棚戶時，則發現棚戶居民，非特所處環境簡陋不堪，衛生方面尙談不到，即日常飲水亦感缺乏，故除轉請衛生，工務各局，特加注意外，並請公用局能予飲水之便利。</p>
<p>在楊樹浦方面，該處體育學校將他遷，故盼能在原址設立中心小學校。又引翔醫院現被中紡公司所接收，亦經該區區民請求，將原院歸還地方自辦。</p>
<p>又議長等定今日再往吳淞及江灣等區視察。</p>
<p>棚戶處境非特簡陋　日常飲水亦感缺乏</p>
<h3>本報第七次星期廣播　銀行與服務　專家孫瑞璜播講</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座合衆電台舉辦第七次星期特別廣播，請經濟專家新華銀行副總經理孫瑞璜播講「銀行與服務」。茲誌其演詞如下：「銀行究竟是什麼機關？什麼呌做銀行？銀行這個名詞，從廣的範圍說，可以包括銀行錢莊信託公司等等，牠們經營的業務，存款有活期存款，定期存款，儲蓄存款，信託有款；放款有活期透支，抵押放款，貼現放款，押匯放款；匯兌有國內匯兌，國外匯兌；投資有買賣證券，招募公司股票債券；保管有露封保管，密封保管，出租保管箱和倉庫堆棧；代理有經租，保險，和代理銀錢收付。從以上所說的各種業務看起來，銀行的業務，不僅僅是接受人的信用和授與人的信用，其他的業務，亦是同樣重要，互相輔助推進的。假如銀行的業務不在全盤上打算，不能全面發展，批整個的業務也就受了影響。譬如說，一個銀行牠能代理買賣證券，牠能經營匯兌和其他種種業務，這些要買賣證券和要匯兌的客戶，勢必要想在這個銀行來開立戶頭，這個銀行收授信用的力量，也就無形的增加了，這個增加的一份力量，就要歸功於銀行中有服務的部份，所以銀行也是服務社會的一種機構。</p>
<p>三項主要作用</p>
<p>銀行旣是服務社會的一種機構，牠對於社會的關係，自然非常的密切，所發生的作用，亦必相當鉅大。現在把牠歸納爲三點，分別講一講：（一）對於社會建設方面社會要繁榮，必須先經過建設的階段，要建設必有龐大的資金，這龐大資金絕非私人可以拿得出，就是政府方面有時亦難應付這龐大的費用，所以必須要靠銀行來協助。（二）對於工商業方面—工商業是發展社會經濟的主要份子，和人民生活有相當的關係，工商業在遝用牠的資金，來增加物品的效用，可以减輕經濟生活的威脅，尤其在現在原料和商品缺少的時候，更非要使工商業資金圓滑不可。銀行業務是以工商業爲對象，對於調劑工商業資金，不斷的努力，工商業是靠銀行，同時銀行亦要靠工商業。（三）對於日常經濟生活方面—銀行對人民日常經濟生活方面，牠也直接或間接發生關係，譬如牠的存款和投資業務，是代人民謀資金的出路，透支和放款，是調劑資金的缺乏，匯兌是互通兩地人民資金的有無，保管和倉庫，是保護人民資財的安全，使用票據和代理收付，是减輕人民收解的麻煩，以上種種，都足以帮助人民處理日常經濟。像美國的銀行，牠們的服務，尤爲週到，如辦房產信託和生活信託等，祇要客戶說要一座怎樣漂亮的房屋，銀行競可以照樣辦到，客戶要準備將來每月的生活費，銀行也可以事前代爲打算，銀行與人民生活的關係，更顯得親切。</p>
<p>以服務爲目的</p>
<p>前面說過，銀行是一個服務社會的機關，所以他的主要任務，當然應以服務社會爲目標，靠增進服務的效能，和推廣服務的區域，來推進銀行業務，業務上的廉錢，爲了自身維持生存，當然是需要的，但是不可太重於私利，而忽略了服務社會的原則。有時在某種情形之下，銀行對社會服務，非但不能賺錢，反而要受了虧蝕，祇要是有利於社會的，銀行亦在所不惜，銀行辦理業務，處處要抱着這種服務精神，相信在不知不覺中，就可以獲得社會的信仰，以及顧客的信任，樹立良好的信用，業務自可逐漸地擴大起來。所以服務第一，是經營銀行至上的信條。</p>
<p>要從正規前進</p>
<p>銀行是隨經濟發展而演進的，經濟愈發展，銀行事業愈發達，銀行發達，家數就逐漸增多，彼此也就免不了競爭。在營業競爭的環境下，要怎樣能博得社會的信仰？怎樣能取得高尙的地位？這全靠牠對於社會貢獻的力量，所以一個銀行要從正規前進，必定以服務社會爲起點，怎樣做一個爲社會服務的銀行呢？我們要認識的有五點：（一）要操持穩健，（二）要遵守法令，（三）要幫助生產事業，（四）不要圖近利，（五）要視顧客如生命。</p>
<p>要有事實表現</p>
<p>銀行爲社會服務，已成爲今日辦銀行的一種口號，但是這個。號，不是僅僅的靠廣吿宣傳，是要有事實的表現，這個事實上的表現，並非一朝一夕的功夫，是要經過許多年的奮鬥，才可以辦得到的。社會上人士對於服務性質的銀行，應當予以協助，使得牠服務的力量加强，服務的範園推廣，怎樣呌做協助呢，就是大家要認識眞正爲社會服務的銀行，和他發生業務上的關係，同時亦可以呌不做服務社會的銀行，知道警惕，統統走上爲社會服務的大道。</p>

<p>征輪力充沛爲主要制勝原因，屠文龍于瑞章之矢無虛發，不論地位角度及遠近，莫不得心應手有如神射，正式陣容之五虎外，餘子表演，亦均不弱，昨晚如程飛，稽德成輩，亦嶄然露頭角。汕隊去歲曾遭征輪毒手，昨晚原擬報復，但打來似嫌過火，陳淸江昨最得手，餘均勉力。十分鐘內形勢頗見平均，難解難分，但十九比十五之後，汕隊即一落千丈，每况愈下，終於不能抵抗而再遭敗挫。</p>
<p>汕隊力戰</p>
<p>兩隊於掌聲中開始比賽，隊長蔡忠强馬爍希互贈隊旗，裁判金家標宣鶴皋，鳴笛開賽，征輪以蔡忠强，屠文龍，于瑞章，劉政軍，王秉煥臨陣，汕隊以馬燦希，　演雄，陳淸江，林維聰，及何立德出塲。接觸後，忠强犯規，蔡演雄罰入開紀錄，迨劉政軍射中，淸江立德又取四分，汕隊以五對二領前，繼成七對四，屠文龍一擲一罰，各七首造平局。淸江演雄　管齊下，汕隊再抬頭，但瞬被迫成各十一平局。忠强近托，征輪超出，汕隊呼停，但未見效，十九對十五時，汕隊二次呌停，仍難邊其鋒芒，前半結果，征輪以廿四對十六，佔先八分。</p>
<p>勢臺破竹</p>
<p>易籃之後，征輪原班人馬，汕隊以陳明義替出蔡演雄，何立德二罰二中，征輪文龍忠强瑞章，各建一功，汕隊暫停，演雄重入，明義下野，征輪一路勢如破竹，比數愈差愈遠。四十二對廿九時，何立德五次犯規畢業，林子仁入代，時林維聽較爲活躍，但客軍于瑞章亦見順手，四十六比卅二，征輪蔡隊長犯規被黜，程飛入塲，程下馬即運中二球。最後四分鐘，屠文龍亦犯規卒業，　德臧入替，汕隊乘機而起，拚力追攻，無奈失分過多，終難挽狂瀾，及錄聲鳴處，征輪以五十六對卅八克汕隊，三戰三勝，</p>

<h3>證金改繳美金債券　經以人所擬變通辦法　洽商經過頗佳　今日可望照常開市</h3>
<p>〔本報訊昨日外傳財政部對證交經紀人保證金以美金縱券抵充之規定，決維特原議，記者特以此事詢諸證交某發言人，據稱：該項傳訊，不知何所據而云然，渠據實以吿：自經財兩部明令發表後，監管證交當局，曾以股市反應情形，與經紀人方面之意見，與中樞主管當局，以長途電話聯絡洽商，經過極爲良好。蓋中樞主管當局，對滬地反應情形，極爲暸解，並未表示有堅持原議之意。又昨日經濟部留滬某負實要員，亦曾與證交當局一度洽談，對若干事實上之困難，特別同情，故洽談經過，殊屬順利圓滿。該發言人認爲此次證交經紀人公會所擬陳之改進意見，頗能顧及事實，應稱合理。渠稱：政府及證交當局，對任何措施之實施，終求其不致發生窒礙，斷不願抹殺事實，獨斷獨行。此番經紀人公會旣已擬具變通意見陳部，而部中對滬市反應情形，又表示暸解同情，故相信對美金債券之繳納，必有緩和辦法頒行，現正靜候部令頒到，以便遵行。故外間傳聞兩部堅特原議之說，當非事實云。</p>
<p>又證交常務理事會日前決議將經紀人公會所擬意見，轉呈經財兩部候核，在未奉部示前，一切照舊辦法辦理，故在證交立塲，今晨當照常開市。經紀人公會日前下午會議結果，對本日之開市問題，經然烈討論一過，意見雖有參差，惟會塲空氣，終認爲爲顧全大局計，仍望以開市爲是</p>
<h3>華茶外銷困難重生　輪出業開緊急會議　擬就產銷計劃希中農採納</h3>
<p>華茶輸出業同業公會，前日在該會召開緊急理監事聯席會議。出席理監事唐季珊等十餘人，討論陳茶處理，及中農辦理茶貸條例苛繁等重要議案</p>
<p>（一）對客歲陳茶，仍由政府拆資收購一節，與金融當局磋商結束，未如理想。經商議今後進行方針，決將去歲七萬担茶集中後，由茶葉聯營公司，會同該業，於今日看樣估價，棄其不合出口標準者，餘均由該公司業務委員會聯合外銷。押款部份，仍擬要求政府儘量撥予。（二）本年度中農行承放八百億元茶貸，所定條例苛繁，茶商殊難接受，決會同茶葉聯營公司，擬就本年度會國茶葉產銷計劃，要求農行依照是項計劃，修訂本年度茶貸辦法。惟農行以難於更動爲辭，當由全體理監事即席議決，將華茶外銷困難，訴之與論界。並推定委員起草吿社曾人士書，定明日假銀行公會招待新聞界。</p>
<p>據關係方面透露：目前外銷茶在國際市堪交易情况，日趨惡劣。經營出口商極盼政府多方協助。茶商因去年陳茶無法處置，利潤一點，已願暫置不論外，至少須使茶商略獲保障。各地茶行對本年製茶，迄今猶裹足不前，且茶葉內銷無望，市塲沉寂，市價回入平疲，在此製茶之初，即遭遇此不利境遇，經營者不免胆寒云。</p>
<p>又據中農行戴聖理稱；政府對外銷茶向極關懷，扶植甚力，月來各地物價波動劇烈，而華茶價格未見提高，此因出口無法展開之故，茶商或巳損失不貲，金融當局可以考慮收購，但擬限於祁門，平水，溫州，三地產品。茶貸辦法容有過嚴，乃有鑒於去歲茶貸辦理經過不善，而不得不如此做者。新任輪廣會陳副主委，在抗戰期間，曾任貿易委會主委，辦理收購茶葉，爲數至鉅，故陳氏必能盡力解決外銷困難云。　聯總定於九月間結束，距目前僅有四月時間，尙有大批救濟物資規定運與我國者，已在積極趕運中，估計於今年九月前定可運畢。</p>
<p>據悉：其中以農漁物資較多，如棉花籽有一千噸運抵華後，準備無價配給各地災農。肥料有二十二萬五千噸，一半發售，一半發放。曳引機有一千五百套，用以助災農墾田。小型農具有一百三十萬件，亦準備發給災農。柴油引擎一千八百部，價售與農墾處。油水機。　井機。七于七百七十七部，亦準備價售與農林部及農墾處。</p>
<p>軋花機二十套，麵粉機二十套，榨油機二十套，小型罐頭設備一百五十噸，將分發各地。積極防治病蟲獸醫藥械三千一百二十七噸，將分發各地防治病畜病疫。漁輪一百六十四艘，及漁業器材九萬噸，將價售與農林部及漁管處。其他尙有水牛一千頭，將公開價售。目前我國各地晨村需要該項物資，故極盼聯總能早日運來，分配應用。</p>
<h3>日本對外貿易活動　日商可以貸物售與商務局　經局核准生再輸往外國</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕外交界息，美國商業公司，原爲盟軍總部統制日本貿易代理人。該公司近聲明，關於日本對外貿易事宜，除棉織品外，其他商品之查詢，自即日起，可逕向日本商人或日本政府商務局，或盟軍總部國外貿易組接洽。惟交易手續，日本商人仍不能直接辦理，須將應售貨物，先行售與日本政府商務局，再由該局代理，經總部核准後，轉售與國外承購者。按日本對外貿易一切事宜，自佔領後，歸盟軍總部統制，並由美政府指定美國商業公司代理總部承辦一切出入口貿易。最近該公司以各國對日通郵限制已自本年一月二日起，經總部放寬，准許使用郵電，作商業情報之交換，故採取上述措施</p>
<h3>新麥轉瞬備採購　購麥貸款數額當局尙無決定</h3>
<p>第四區麵粉工業同業公會，上週言分呈行政院·糧食部·經濟部。四聯總處等有關機關，請求指示本年收購小麥計劃，並從速舉辦粉麥貸款，希望貸與三千億元，迄未獲覆。</p>
<p>該業負責人榮毅仁日前習京，與糧食部當局作非正式交換意見，藉利進行。同時該業因去歲交通銀行曾參加麥貸，故現已向交行商請繼續協助收購。但由於小麥整個收購計劃與貸款數額，須經糧部核准，而新麥六月初旬即將登塲，各方籌備工作迄未見進展。兼之中樞最近人事更調，致遲遲未有切實表示，粉廠殊爲焦急。</p>
<p>現廠方根據本市及近郊消費量加以統計，認爲本市各廠至少須千億元始能週轉。連日與金融當局接談結果，成認此次麥貸實甚重要，各廠決定如下週間當局仍無若何決定者，各廠商將單獨先行籌集資金，前往產地收購，俾增加生產，供匯需要。</p>
<h3>中農行舉辦　糧食生產貸欵</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行爲增加糧食生產，擬舉辦糧食生產貸款。除普通貸放外，並擬對綏靖區及黃淮兩河汎區各縣，多加配貸，協助農民復耕，增加糧食供應。貸款用途以購買種子，肥料，耕牛，農具等爲限。茲悉該案經四聯總處核准，在二百億元限額內分配貸放，並准向國行九折轉抵押。</p>
<h3>出口商請求展緩　寄售品結滙期</h3>
<p>進出口業公會鑒於最近國外市塲銷路呆滯，貨價步跌，僅皮毛一項即已下跌五成以上。然中央銀行對出口業裝運國外之寄售貨物，凡委託銷售之外匯，概須限於五月廿四日結售，否則即委託中央信託局國外代理人不限價售出，以致羣情惶惶。均認爲出口商過去爲政府爭取外匯基金，曾蒙受極大犧牲，而目前則因國外市價步跌，旣不准從國外運回，更須限期結售外匯，如此情形，不僅有達政府鼓勵出口原則，更將迫使今後出口商再不敢從事輪出業務。</p>
<p>該會將於今日具呈中央銀行，列述理由，要求體念商艱，收回成命，展延結售外匯日期，使出口商少　損書，以符政府鼓勵２出之原旨。</p>
<h3>燃管會主委徐樂天談　華北東北煤礦現况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會主任委員徐榮天由京返滬，接見記者時稱：華北東北煤礦之產量均有增加，但鐵路因時道破壞，兼以車皮不够分配，故運輸力尙待增强。政府爲保證華中華南煤斤供給不斷，將致力於淮南及其他新煤田之發展。淮南經兩三個月之準備工作，一切已有頭緒，通裕溪口之鐵路亦將加强，以便煤斤運輸。至於礦煤之提高價格與及華北行商之要求加價問題，在京時曾與開灤淮南華東及東北六礦負責人會商，並向王副院長請示，政府在不妨碍生產之原則下，願作合理之調整。本月份因政府繼續實施補貼政策，不擬有所變動，燃管會正擬具辦法，將於六月份提出物價會議作整個之解決。華出各煤礦之保護問題，在說時亦有詳盡商討，決定增強護礦兵力，以策安全。過去共軍佔領煤礦，常用以繼續生產，並以煤斤易取我方之物資。近則政策變更，佔領煤礦後，對設備盡情破壞，例如大同煤礦，經日本數年之經營、已有開灤之規模，自經共軍攻佔後，破壞不堪目前僅以土法生產，而產量亦徵不足道。博山煤礦之機器，經中共拆除後運往烟台，未來之恢復工作，將難於進行。諸如此類之事，不一而足，故護礦工作，異常重要。又煤斤水運運費，航業界亦要求提高，現由交通部航政司李司長景潞與航業界洽商中。</p>
<h3>食油自由交易　油市塲今開市</h3>
<p>吳市長爲穩定本市民食主要物資價格，除飢水已准自由買賣，茲悉現又特許食油自由交易，取銷限價制度，並由油商業公會開設食油市塲，定於今（十九）日上午十時，正式開市。吳市長，市參議會潘議長公展，淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，社會局長吳開先等將蒞臨致訓。</p>
<p>又悉：最近本市油糧來源甚感困難，前途未許樂觀。因東北營口秦皇島等地，嚴厲禁止出口，聞油糧業已擬具意見，請求吳市　長向營口等當地政府交涉。俾疏暢貨源。</p>
<h3>汽車商業　同業公會成立</h3>
<p>本市汽車車商業同業公會，昨日上午十時，價大西洋菜社舉行成立大會。到各機關代表及會員等八十餘人。　由臨時主席陳克２致開會辭，劉靖昇報吿籌備經過。次由黨政　開代表及來賓等先後致詞，繼討論會章，票選理監事，計理事朱大勛，周夢賢等十五人當選。</p>
<h3>上海乳品製造廠　新出淡白脫</h3>
<p>上海乳品製造廠，創設多年，專製「安健兒」「金獅牌」全脂奶粉及白脫奶油等，最近添設新型機器，除仍供應「安健兒」「金獅牌」奶粉外，並發行新鮮消毒牛奶，推行以來，已達數千戶。並又新「安健兒」鹹淡白脫二種，分一磅半磅裝及四分之一磅裝三種。遠勝外貨。現由各大洋酒糖菓食物號普遍發售。</p>
<h3>台灣肥料副產品　擬運滬供組工廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處息：台灣肥料副產品製肥料及其副產品。肥料方面，氣氣肥料年產一萬二千噸，磷質肥料年產三萬二千噸。副產品方面，硫酸六六度者，月產一百至二百噸，五十度者月產五百至八百噸，此外電石月產三百至五百噸，電極（即炭精）月產六十噸。炭精出品，共分三吋，八吋，十二吋三種。硝　月產十一噸以上，聞產品中，肥料將留作台灣自用，副產品則擬銷滬，惟不擬作爲一般商品銷售，而望能供應各工廠直接需用。其分配辦法，聞將由工商輔導　召集各工廠洽商云。</p>
<h3>香業公會　組香斗聯營處</h3>
<p>市香業公會香斗組，鑒於過去經營未能共同連絡，以致承接定貨貨價及壘質參差不齊，過來又以原料價增，工資膳食等開支益形浩大，爰經組織聯營處，以提高品質，　一價格，自即日開始承　定貸云。</p>

<h3>魏道明蒞台記</h3>
<p>— 台北十五日航訊　本報記者楊育</p>
<p>治理從日本人竊據了五十餘年後解放的台灣省的重任，自今天起開始，由有着一年半歷史的長官公署的陳儀長官處，卸到新省府的首任主席魏道明博土的肩上。這是光復後的一件大事。人的更動，台胞沒有過份驚奇，然而人人在担憂着從二二八事件直到如今的政治上的無形停頓與脫節，焦急着接替者的姍姗來遲。很多人這樣說：「日本統治時代，換一個總督，只要三天就接上了。」這樣等待等待，畢竟在昨天上午十一時零五分，千萬隻滿含着希望的眼睛，看到魏主席同他夫人鄭毓秀博士，從中航ＸＴ－Ｔ六八號的飛機裏，走下在台北郊外的松山機塲上。南國早熱，太陽像火一般灼人肌膚，機塲上洶湧着興奮熱列的人浪</p>
<p>機塲廣播</p>
<p>魏主席穿着深色的夾西裝，精神健旺。魏夫人脫下了黑眼鏡，含笑接受了兩束鮮豔的獻花，並立着讓二，三十集鏡頭從容攝下了這可紀念的一刹那。在軍樂聲中，儀仗隊的鋼盔刀刺間，長長的歡迎行列的人頭與旗幟間，看到魏主席移步走到了機塲休息室前而的麥克風旁。省參議會黄議長代表全省民衆致詞歡迎：「中央特地派了在外交上極有成就的魏主席來主持台政，亦可見中央重視台省的一般。」這些話用台灣語，客家語，日本語敵譯出來。魏主席的答詞雖簡單，他很省力。他說：一台灣被日本人竊據五十多年，經過八年血戰，才從新歸入祖國懷抱，初來此地，極悠興奮。今後願竭全力與合胞共謀台省的幸福。」這些話播向海島的每一個角落，誰都祈求着幸福，相信新主席在這些心聲傳出以後，確能爲台胞帶來新幸福。</p>
<p>從機塲一直排到賓館的學生隊伍，足足購了兩小時的烈日，這時候望着二八〇〇一號汽車，有的揮旗，有的歡呼，魏主席頻頻點首，魏夫人則在車內傴僂了體軀，向行列擺手。</p>
<p>施政方針</p>
<p>魏主席在當天下午三時假台北賓館招待記者的時候說：「我很願意知道地方的民意與與論。」觀乎他下機後休息不足三小時，就趕着和記者們作第一次的會面，就很足以使記者們感到安慰，同樣也値得記者們在今後的工作上更作一重警惕。主政治，應該要尊重人民的公意，但也須要遵循法治途徑。在經濟方面，將以最大努力來求安定，從安定中再求發展，繁榮。」經濟自由政策之推進，雖屬必要，但原則上還在無書於經濟的安定。」他復補充說：「原則決定了，但具體問題須要詳細研究，個別硏究，然後再通盤計劃，通盤解決，似乎比較切合實際。」同時他也用這些話來答覆了很多記者所提出有關的問題，如經濟的扶助方式，公敎人員待遇的調整，魏主席很肯定這一種見解；弄淸楚一個問題決不容易，單憑簡單的思考來決定一個措置，往往會失敗的。</p>
<p>強調考慮</p>
<p>記者們最關心的是過去公署機構的調整問題，交通處，工礦處，警務處，有着一個如何改動的可能？專賣，貿易兩局會有怎樣的對策？公營事業如何處理？小之於舞塲，公娼的問題，魏主席多這樣答覆：「這是我考慮問題之一。」他表示，目前在新機構未曾調整前，一切仍維持現狀。他強調「考慮」兩個字。</p>
<p>談到新聞界的本身，魏主席說：省府當專設一個機構，經常與新聞界取得聯齊，他本人也希望能時時與記者們保持接觸。關於本省報紙上的日文版，魏主席認爲在過渡時期，似亦有存在的價値，但重心還在國語的積極推行。</p>
<p>有一個記者這樣詢問魏主席：「魏夫人有意於領導本省的婦運嗎！」魏主席被引得發笑，　面笑一面說：「那還是去問她本人吧！」</p>
<p>四時，魏主席又接着要招待各界代表，他在結束了這個記者招待會就離去了。臨行時，他招呼記者隨意用點茶點。由警備司令部的　光銘參謀長代表了主人和我們談笑風生。</p>
<p>新的一頁從現在揭開，建設新台灣的步調將作更進一層的開展，六百萬人民將永遠關注着，希冀着！（五月十六日）</p>
<p>魏主席用書面報吿來說明政方針：「有秩序的民</p>

<h3>跟槍兵在一起　重溫箇舊美夢　滇南十日　（一）</h3>
<p>— 昆明十二日航訊　本報特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>三迤的民性，一般說來是勤苦耐勞，因爲自然的環境孕育了這一種特性，而此中滇南的人民更表現得十分强悍。在這一個廣大的區域裏，生活着許多倚賴力氣靠天吃飯的人羣。只是表現在另一面的。滇南正是文物薈萃之區，才士輩出，造成了滇省文化的重心。</p>
<p>昆明的外勤記者很早便有集體視觀滇南的打算，分頭接洽以後，上月二十六日我們這一個臨時組合終得如願成行，其中的份子除了昆市九家日晚報各派一人外，還加上了京滬各大報駐昆記者四人，一路說說笑笑，倒也不怎麽寂寞。來回一共耗費了十天，足跡到了宜良，呈貢。開遠。箇舊·蒙自幾個縣份，然而時間躭擱得較長的是箇舊，因爲那兒是中國的「錫都」我們都很小心地參觀了一下。</p>
<p>熱圈裏的城市：開遠</p>
<p>經過了整一天又半日的火車和汽車，我們到達了箇舊，旅途上一是够辛苦的，滇越鐵路的窄軌和小火車頭，爬起坡來特別顯得吃力，而滇南的氣候又遠不如昆明的陰凉。我們一步步地走近了熟圈，在車廂裏有如置身在蒸籠中，再加上那些多得難以數計的大小山洞，乘客的窒悶程度是只有自己知道的，幸好路局方面對於行車時刻還很準確，整整耗費了十一個鐘頭，在當天下午六點鐘抵達了滇南大城城——開遠。</p>
<p>開遠的天氣已經十足是江南的初夏風光了。一條石坂街道，冷寂而又懶散地展延在市區的中心，店舖裏的小學徒，穿着汗背心，在應付數得淸的顧主。商塲是不很景氣的。石坂上留下一兩聲木拖鞋「踢躂」的饗聲，沉重而且嘹喨，它突破了開遠城的死寂空氣。</p>
<p>在鐵路飯店的凉棚下，我和滇越鐵路特別黨部書記長劉鏡明談起了大家關心的滇越路。他的嗓子提得非常嚮亮說：「滇越路必需迅速修復，這確實是當前的一個最迫切的工作。」接着他說明了開遠在滇越道中以及對國外貿易的重要性。目前碧色寨至河口一段的修復工作，一直還在延擱中。看情形，明年雨季以前能够完工，便是天大的好事，交通部對於工程費方面雖早批准了九十三億元，只是錢不到手，總是「紙上談兵」，現時僅是收到先行撥交的十億元，物價如此，人力如此，又濟得了些啥事？</p>
<p>修復滇越鐵路　困難尙待克服</p>
<p>說來，要修復滇越鐵路，困難實在是太多了，首先中法權利的爭執問題，迄今還沒有定案，我方認爲接收以後的滇越鐵路，至少在國境內的幹綫，法方無權過問，而法國人却一再要求實行共管，這在任一方面都是很難說得通的，在所謂「利益均霑」的前提之下，如果中國的國際地位不能提高，法方恐怕還很難得有放鬆的徽象。</p>
<p>再說越南局勢不靖，在材料運輸方面便是一個個最大的問題，枕木鋼軌之類，姑無論是否有錢購買，或是否能購買到手，但如何運到這一個地區來舖設，依然不得解決，而雨季一到，季候上的阻梗更是一層大大的牽制，在這樣多多的困難之下，來談修復滇越路，自然是敎人感到萬分氣沮的。</p>
<p>帶着滿腹疑團在開遠的旅店裏睡了一夜，我想負責路政的人都是束手無策，那麼，我這門外漢又能得到什麼結論？翌日一早，我們爬上了一輛大卡車，把一些問題甩在腦後，向採訪中心地－－箇舊——進發了。</p>
<p>開遠到箇舊僅只有五十三公里，如果坐「箇碧石鐵路」的火車需要十小時，走公路只要坐三個鐘頭的汽車，兩相比較之下，想還是汽車快便，只是，天喲！開動後在我的旅行經歷中，還從來不曾遇到這樣壞的路面，碎石嶙峋，亂草叢生，哪里算得上是一條公路？</p>
<p>物們的錫都：箇舊</p>
<p>好吃力地就這樣一顚一拐地把我們帶進了箇舊縣城，到達一個新的地方以後，三個鐘頭的驚險與疲勞又早已丢在腦後了。</p>
<p>雲南錫業公司爲我們佈署了歇宿的地方，他們的盛情招待使長途跋踄者减少了若干不便。在茶會上，呂協理接到了警衛隊長的報吿，一們粤籍礦工地帶着兩條香烟，被匪徒以爲是鈔票，竟在大街上被小刀戮死了。這消息對陌生的旅客說來，自然是不寒而慄，每個人都在叩問着自己：箇舊竟是這麽一個恐怖之城麽？</p>
<p>疑惑與恐懼交熾在心頭，傍晚，錫業公司派了四個槍兵護送，讓我們有了一次全城巡禮。我和警衛隊長走在前頭，不規則的石頭路，便依山勢的高低舖成了一條長長的坡道，我一任脚步在亂石中移動，終於不耐地發問了：「城究竟在哪裘呢？」</p>
<p>繁榮早成過去　箇舊在嗚咽着</p>
<p>「先生，我們一直都在城中呀！」衛隊長提醒了我，於是我才定睛朝各處打量，道一個舉世聞名的錫都，竟破落得成這樣，不親歷其境的話，眞敎我難於置。　旁店舖門關閉得緊緊的，山包圍着城，一片荒蕪的景象，我恨我的無用的筆不能刻劃在讀者的眼前。</p>
<p>於是，我由警衛隊長的口中，得悉了箇舊在這些一年來的興衰演變。「箇舊眞是個破落戶了。「說話者眞不勝今　之感，他鐵掉入了回憶的深淵裏，開始溫習繁榮時期的美夢。他說在簡舊的全盛時代，單說礦上的砂丁便近二十萬人，廠哥（即開礦的資本主）也很多，那時候，戲院，電影院都有，舶來品是先到箇舊，哪裏會輪得上昆明人講時　？廠哥們把成噸的錫礦換成了鈔票，塞進了荷包，上好的雲土，金子做成的烟其，試問：哪裏找得着這點排塲？</p>
<p>說到吃：山珍美味，熊掌燕窩，當時在箇舊算得了什麽？臙客是常事，一請便是三五百桌，不算稀奇。廠哥們的威風是不可一世的。可惜好景不常，時過境遷，到今天不要說人，便是這一個城市也在暗暗地嗚咽，這一個除了錫之外什麽也不生產的地方，面臨今天這點凄凉的情况，眞有點彷彿大少爺落了難似的。</p>
<p>市政千頭萬緒　不知從何着手</p>
<p>繁榮的日子早就過去了，眼前箇舊蕭條不堪，這個以礦興起的城市，正在向新舊廠哥們召喚，希望黄金時代再現，又回復到當年的鬧熱。</p>
<p>箇舊在抗戰中一共遭受了敵機的十八次轟炸，在雲南全境內說來，損失相當可觀，市街上還留有炸後的遺痕，一任其荒蕪蕪着。在這錫業尙待昭蘇的時候，誰還能有心情注意到市政的復興？</p>

<p>箇碧石鐵路之窄軌與小火車頭</p>
<p>（持派員徐繼濂攝）</p>
<p>廣東一道防綫</p>
<p>馬鞍圍防潦農田水利工程，是以偉大的人力，來和天然暴力抗爭一種最具體的表現。馬鞍團是在廣東惠陽縣境內，東江及其支流泗江的匯流處。那裏地士肥美，物價豐饒，全區平原一片，約一百七十平方里，農田達二十萬畝，但因過去水利未興，農田失利，每年雨季降臨，洪潦泛濫，淹漫田野，爲害至烈。明萬曆年間，當地鄉民曾沿東江築長圍二十一公里，後經大潰過一次，嗣後隨修隨毁，已失防洪之效，而且當時對東江支流的泗江，未加顧及，東江水漲，即倒流入泗江，淹沒兩岸田野，莫之能禦。距今二十年前，該圍更曾潰決達兩公里，洪流夾砂而入，覆田五千餘畝，至今沙漠一片，寸草不長。據當地父老談：當時兩塊錢一畝田也沒有人要，使全區二十萬肥沃的田畝，幾乎變爲荒地，這是一件多末可惜的事情！所以當地有識之士，便認爲非興辦此一水利，不足以使鄉民安定生聚，這可以說是馬鞍圍興築的動機；但一件偉大的工程完成，當非一朝一夕的事，除了時間，財力和人力之外，還要毅力和決心，才有今天的成功哩。</p>
<p>建築經過　歷時四載</p>
<p>關於馬鞍圍建築的經過，從測量，設計和數次籌劃興工以至完成，中間費時四年有餘。這期間在當地策動的鄕紳曾經奔走呼籲，排難解紛，歷盡勞苦，更有過壯烈犧牲的事蹟。現在，該圍圍董會董事長丘兆琛將軍，便是這工程的最努力的推動者，抗戰時他是湖南長沙警備司令，也是惠陽縣的紳士，因戰時洋米來源斷絕，粤全省發生普遍糧荒之象，東江各縣危機尤甚。該地鄕紳如丘兆琛將軍等，感於該地水利不修，致影響民食，遂於民國三十一年冬天，發起修築馬鞍圍之議，當時惠陽縣長劉炳綱先生倡導尤力，不料惠陽不久即被敵侵陷，劉縣長因四處奔跑鼓吹興辦馬鞍圍水利，不及逃出，終放被俘不屈，積勞成疾致死，後獲國府明令褒獎，所以他可算是爲馬鞍圍而犧牲的。後惠陽失而復得凡三次，丘將軍等對這工作仍繼續努力不懈，於卅二年六月，呈准省府派隊前往測量，次年八月全部設計工作亦已完成，正擬動工興築，惠陽又第四次淪陷，以致籌建工作祗好停頓。</p>
<p>六十萬人　安定生聚</p>
<p>勝利以後，羅卓英將軍回主粤政，樹起建省大計首重民生的目標，因此農田水利建設，成爲主要的工作項目；馬鞍圍水利工程的興建便舊事重提，最初本擬利用日俘，以節省工費，但不久日俘悉被運送返國，而偌大之工款又不易籌措，致又不能實現。及去年六月，謝文龍接長建廳，亦亟謀這工程能迅速實施，恰好當時伍智梅，林翼中，陸幼剛，胡木蘭，蕭次妖，　翼羣等組織廣東糧食救濟協會，以粤省糧荒嚴重，急須增產救濟，標本兼施，特撥賑款一億四千餘萬元，對這工程首作倡導，後復得農行貸款八億六千餘萬元，及水利委員會撥借墊款九千餘萬元，粤善救分署撥賑工糧一千二百餘噸，再由當地的圍董會自籌工款三億餘元，於是這個偉大的工程，便於去年十二月五日奠基，至本年五月初旬全部完成；共計歷時一五閱月，耗資二十八億餘元，動員當地的民工達九十萬人，在政府與人民通力合作之下，來完成了這一道保衛民生的防綫，從此可使這二十萬畝的農田，不再受東江洪水的威脅，全縣六十萬鄕民，亦得安定生聚。這不單是奧省復員後建設最大的成就，而且據水利委會的紀錄，它還是勝利復員後，中國的最大農田水利工程哩</p>
<p>偉大基圍　六十華里</p>
<p>五月十一日，羅全席親往主持這個馬鞍圍防潦工程的落成典禮，記者隨往參與盛會，並得親睹這一偉大工程的全貌：它是一道漫長的基圍，蜿蜒平坦，彷彿像萬里長城；全長達六十華里，全工程土方一百一十萬公方。其中約可分爲兩段：一是自馬鞍山起，沿惠平公路內側，跨龍蟠，歷林村，大湖溪而達崩山，再跨臨江瀝折而東北向直達東江江岸，至譚屋山爲止，長七，八八〇公尺，圍基高度高出洪水位一公尺，頂寬取二公尺，內外坡取一比二。經過各溪瀝以大湖溪爲最大。另一是舊圍，自譚屋山起，沿東江江岸，直趨上游，經萬年村，水口墟，蓬瀛村等地，而達三山止，長二二六公里，是大湖溪源流所經之地，也是全區僅有由區外流入之溪水，發源地點離合山門約二公里。沿圍共計有水閘七座，均以紀念各長官策劃督導的功績和各機關的協助而取名，其中最大的大湖溪水閘，爲紀念羅主席的功勳，特名爲一慈威閘」，其餘是「瑞夫閘」，「中農聞」，「糧救閘」，「善救閘」，「文龍閘」，「羣賢閘」等，其中除合山門的羣賢閘是採用豎板式外，其餘均爲捲蓬式。</p>
<p>廿萬畝田　蒙受利益</p>
<p>負責主持這工程的，是李澤敷工程師，他對農田水利工程有豐富的經騐，從民國卅一年開始，他便爲這工程而努力。據他估計這一工程的價値，不但可使廿萬畝農田，不爲洪潦所侵，而且還可賴水閘來節制水量，以蘊蓄區內湖塘溪瀝之水，而資灌漑溉。所以這工程的利益預計是這樣：</p>
<p>（一）直接受防潦之益者－現有可耕之地一十五萬市畝，每年可增收稻穀三十萬市担，雜糧三萬市担。</p>
<p>（二）利用水閘節蓄湖溪水永量兼收灌漑之利者－上項一十五萬市畝中，大半爲湖塘溪瀝交錯者，每年可增收稻穀五萬市担，雜糧二萬市担。</p>
<p>（三）藉防潦之功而收墾荒之利者－開墾牧馬塲大草原二萬餘市畝，及其他各處荒地二萬餘市畝，初年約可增產稻穀十萬市担，雜糧二萬市担。</p>
<p>以上總計每年增產稻穀四十五萬市担，雜糧七萬市担，這數目已足担負了本省缺糧總額四分之一，在糧食問題嚴重的今日，這數字對全省遺食的調　，已有不少的助力了！</p>
<p>開墾增產　尙待努力</p>
<p>誠然，這巨大的工程是完成了，但是以後的問題還是多着。正如羅主席所說：「這才是工作的開始，這工程有如一這城墻，但我們還須善爲保養，方不致再讓洪水敵人來攻破；而且如何使區內的農田受益確能大量生產，則尙有待於大家的努力。」的確，園是修好了，但這僅是防潦的消極辦法，要眞正大量生產，還要有具體的計劃和廣大的人力。同時，我們還不能忽略了將來地權利益分配的問題，因爲區內的地價，當然會隨着工程完成而上漲，將來地　糾紛是難以避免的，所以這更有賴於當地政府和明達鄕紳以遠大的眼光，公平處理，爲多數的民衆着想。一切權利義務，規定淸楚，並領導他們積極開墾增產，這工程才有眞正的價値，予可以使民衆在千百年後得到永久的利益。</p>
<h3>皖相六安印象</h3>
<p>— 合肥八日快訊　本報記者寶白萍</p>
<p>屏障東南水陸通，此州不與別州同</p>
<p>山環英霍千重秀，地控江淮四百雄</p>
<p>——汪洪詠六安州詩</p>
<p>春雨半濕了記者衣衫時，安徽公路局的敞車好容易走完一百零一公里的途程，把記者從合肥帶到皖西重地的六安。</p>
<p>六安瀕淮河支流渒河上游的東岸從皖中平原向西去，到此已是小邱陵地。</p>
<p>宋代葉適所作「六安縣新學記」說：「六安，皋陶故國，亡後四百餘年，而英布（據六安州志載，英布是六安人），與項羽滅棄，又助漢畔楚，再王其地云」。現在六安東二十里外，六合公路的旁邊，有皋陶祠和皋陶墓，城內有英布墓，但是荒草野蔓，已找不出遺跡，這只是一個傳說，六安的老人們都不敢向記者斷定那是眞實。、</p>
<p>明代以後，六安以茶而著名，「徽六名茶」，茶商們一直把它懸作吸引顧客的招牌，而六安的地名，也藉此特別稱著了。</p>
<p>物產豐富百姓窮</p>
<p>民國二十年，六安西部一部份劃歸增設的立煌縣，全縣面積現有三千七百九十三方公里，散居着七十萬人口，在安徽設來，比之各縣，它面積佔第三位，人口佔第六位。地在山岳與平原之間，最高溫度爲攝氏二十九度半，最低爲六度半，一年間平均是十八度，總雨量是九〇四·九公厘，就在縣境廣大溫度雨量適宜的天然環境優越條件下，構成它是安徵一個富庶的縣份。現屬第二行政督察區，列爲一等縣，在從事縣政工作人們的眼中，往往認它是一個理想的好地方。</p>
<p>在六安五十二個鄕鐵中，嚴格說起來，有平原，有邱陵。有山地，因此，出產種類很多，著名的是茶蔴竹木米麥，據不太精確的統計，茶葉年產最多時。有三萬四千多祖，少時也有一萬三千餘担，蔴產豐收時有七萬九千担，西南部山地，遍地竹木，米麥供給本縣食用，綽有餘裕，假使拿它來和窮小的縣份相比，六安可說是得天獨厚了。</p>
<p>然而，六安雖是物產富庶，在今天並不是家給戶足的，農民們辛辛苦苦所收穫的土產，都被商人們用最低的成本轉到手中，運鑰外埠去織　　了。農民們僅是懷抱着些微賸餘的產物，來打發終年愁苦的歲月，他們並不因自有土地上的財富而得着生活上絲毫享受，並且永是輾轉在高利貸壓迫下呻吟。就在距離六安卅多里地方，記者乘坐的汽車拋錨，得便見到路旁有一家住民的草棚連門也沒有，其生活糟到什麽程度，由此可以想見！</p>
<p>銅頭鐵嘴　豆腐腔</p>
<p>記者踏進六安街道，第一印象是淸潔寗靜。城牆已在抗戰期中奉令拆除，據說是預防如被日本軍侵進，便於向它作游擊戰的。六安嘗在二十七年七月起淪陷過四個月，敵人撤走後·就一直恢復了自由的日子。因爲地近合肥淪陷區，自邪惡八年到勝利時，曾有一度極大的繁榮。那時候，茶蔴走私出口。布鹽走私進來，遂令六安走了「抗戰運」，盛極一時，到今天，六安旅社多，飯館多，可說是當時繁榮的遺跡，而目前呢，已是百業蕭條，看不到熙攘攘的情形了。</p>
<p>六安向有「銅頭鐵嘴豆腐腔」之諺，這是形容六安人的習性。在六安，不論祁寒或感暑·出門很少有人戴帽子，乃稱之爲「銅頭」。除掉最熱的天氣·一年中總是把菜放在火鍋裏吃，稱之爲「鐵嘴」。朋友們往來，論事也好，撩天也好，愛在牀上或睡椅上躺躺·稱之爲「豆腐腔」。記者在六安第一次進館店用飯時，茶房首先就送上一個火鍋，裏面是原已煮好的紅燒魚，最初頗引爲奇，已是暮春季·節，何以還用火鍋，後來才知道這是當地鄕風。但是那個紅燒魚放在火鍋裏，邊煮邊吃，味道很好，雖是初試這種吃法，甚覺滿意。比之重慶冬天的羊肚火鍋，實有過之而無不及。</p>
<h3>李培恩博士談學潮</h3>
<p>— 杭州十二日快訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>國立英士大學學生，爲了校舍和校長的問題，向敎育部請願，不辭勞苦跋涉，由金華搭　贛路車抵杭，想循杭滬·滬京鐵路到南京向教育部陳訴去。在此，滬杭路一度中斷，糾紛迭起，此時記者正在由滬返杭途中，受阻於嘉興。返杭後，走訪之江大學校長李培恩博士，相談良久，一致認爲今日國內的學術風氣漸次衰頽，我們僅見有人捐助學金，捐築校舍，而未見有捐贈教授，捐贈儀　　書者。其原因大抵爲捐獎學金，捐築校舍，可以得名，　　　儀器圖書，埍贈敎授者沒有什麽了不起。但是敎授與設備爲學生智識的源泉。此番英大發生這一問題，當也爲了沒有好敎授和沒有好設備所致啊！</p>

<h3>女傭</h3>
<p>— 陳家驊</p>
<p>她是一個典型的鄉下婦人，無論從行動，穿着及打扮上，她那種土裏土氣的樣子，馬上可以看得出來的。</p>
<p>王媽介紹進來，說是有三個優點；一，同鄉；二，老實；三，個性特別馴良。然而數日以後，我只發現了她的老實。所謂老實，不也是愚笨的別稱嗎！</p>
<p>譬如孩子哭了，你不告訴他去逗，她一直會把兩隻破爛的襪底，揍七揆八的耐心的補綴着，表示很「能做」的樣子。而且有客人來時，倒茶是非催之又催不可的，要呌她弄一點點心之類的話，問這問那，簡直比賽自己動手還麻煩。</p>
<p>臉上又有「破相」，妻說她的丈夫是給她的面相「釘死」的。因爲她的臉部肌肉特別發達，尖尖的，看上去的印象有些像釘子一般。這樣，最頑皮的三弟，便取笑　，呌她爲釘子。「釘子」，這樣呌她一聲時，她竟蹣跚的走來了。「什麼」！她的聲音是低低的</p>
<p>於是大家便呌她爲「釘子」了，「釘子」「釘子」，她便忙得國團聽了、</p>
<p>她不但愚來，眼睛也似乎特別運鈍，她簡直沒有做過一件較好的給人家激美的事。譬臺我想換一身衣服，她一定把妻的也拿了來。</p>
<p>「你這人——是師母的１」</p>
<p>有時不免責斥幾句，但她仍一樣。甚至早晨上市去買些小菜，油瓶同醫汕瓶常常換）錯。菜油盛在醬油瓶裏還不妨，然而菜汕瓶裏裝了醬油，這就糟了。雖說妻再三可囑着，甚至在瓶口上纏了黃色及黑色的絨綫，作爲記號，但還是纏不淸楚。</p>
<p>有人來訪問而我倆沒有在家的時候，那更麻煩。她只聽得懂餘姚的家鄉話，紹屬人來訪我們的話，此較還好；至於不是紹屬人，那末這樣那樣，至少得　上半天。</p>
<p>一天北平的菁來訪妻，菁問：「太太在家嗎」？竟給回絕了。菁第二次又來，又給回絕。第三次來訪時，却巧妻站在門口，這樣才見面。原因是「釘子」只知道家中有「先生」與「師母」，不知道「太太」其人的。</p>
<p>於是妻常常埋怨着，緊咬着牙，咒咀着：</p>
<p>「眞眞是釘子，很好的事，給梗壞了。」</p>
<p>因她常常做着很使人掃興的事情，有一天，我同她談了兩小時。雖說我們是同鄉，只是自己多年在外鄉飄泊，鄉音很少，所以我們的談話很不順利。</p>
<p>釘子不但不能聽懂我的話，而且她又不會講，除了「是格」「儂得」以外，簡直不會再發另外的聲音了。本來我想在同她談話的機會裏，科正她的缺點，告訴她幾點普通的應酬常識。然而這結果，眞使我啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>妻常常嚷着換一個，因爲她說「這樣人，反而增加麻煩。」然我只有委婉的勸妻忍耐，必要的事情自己動手，</p>
<p>我勸妻忍耐的緣故，我覺得「釘子」的一點誠實特別可愛。她雖不似先前的張嫂的伶俐，然而她也不會似張嫂的玩花樣。張嫂到市上去，五千一萬元的零用，常常決不會給回來的，「報脹」簡直是沒有的事。她却相反她或許小菜買得差一點，做得不够滋味。但每天－當市塲裏回來時，便向妻「報賬」一次。多一元便找還，少一元則要回。假如記不起來了，她會急得什麼似的，大聲嚷着：「師母讓我再報一遍」。萋雖說算了，算了，但她不肯就算了的。「肉五千」，她便把大姆指一伸；「魚千五」，又把食指一伸；這樣要把五個屈着的指頭頭完全伸直爲止，因爲家裏限定每天買五樣小菜的。</p>
<p>待完全知道她的個性以後，妻便不再責斥她。比較重要的事情，常由妻自己動手，這樣「釘子」的工作，遂由外勤而變爲做僅逗弄初生的孩子毛兒，及看家洗衣之類。</p>
<p>「唉唉小官人不要哭，媽上市去呢，」毛兒哭了時，她會用濃重的鼻音，喃喃的念着，輕拍着他。</p>
<p>現在有人來看我們的時候，她也會凑上一二句，或是說：「請留個條吧」！</p>
<p>一年以後，我們便把她認爲自己人了，和隣居家的傭人們也相處得很好。因她的誠實與勤儉，妻亦十分高興。常常說：「釘子給我們訓練好了」，而有時，她也會同我談幾句：「先生嘛」，「師母嘛」，語音已十分淸晰，不似初來時的重濁，纏夾不淸</p>
<p>有一天，她向妻低低的啜泣着，說是要回家去了。這突如其來的事情，使妻摸不着頭腦。對她已有一分信任的妻，自然挽留她，而且追問她辭職的原由。</p>
<p>但她並不說什麼，雙眼的淚水瀉個不停。晚上我從報社裏回去的時候，她的眼睛已完全紅腫了。</p>
<p>「師母，二月以後再來吧，」什麽挽留也沒有用，她終於走了，僅僅留了這句話。</p>
<p>她離去後的第三天，在一家穩婆的門口，我見到她一眼，我奇怪她沒有回家去。她手裏做着一個靑布包袱、後面跟着我家的隣居張公館的一個門房，呌做老姜的。她見着我彷彿很怕羞的樣子。</p>
<p>又過了一天，老姜惶急急地來找我，要我助一點後，說是「釘子」死了，預備買一口棺材。</p>
<p>妻急得什麽似的，追問她。</p>
<p>「小產」老姜吶吶的說：</p>
<p>「小產？」妻大呼起來，抓着頭，不信任的樣子。</p>
<p>我看着老姜這樣尷尬的神情，又聯想到四五天以前他同「釘子」一道走進穩婆家去的情形，我已知道這不幸的故事的槪梗了</p>
<p>果然，第二天在自己的報上，看到一隻花邊新聞，說是某公館的一個女傭，因爲「打胎」，竟致橫死，並說穩婆及關係人姜阿雲已被逮捕云云。</p>
<h3>葡萄游魚</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<h3>翠園　——楊州貫夢之十七</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>幼年嬉遊之地，到了傷於哀樂的中年，總會時時在念。偶或還鄉復經其地，見到景物全非，更易於發生滄桑之感。在昔揚州舊城七　的倒城旁，原是一片的荒烟蔓草。到了前淸宣統末年，曾有人在那裏建築房屋，創設大同戲館，一時也還鐵鼓喧　，仕女雜沓。可是爲時極短，即遇光復，戲館也便閉歇。房屋爲風雨所侵襲，時日旣久，便覺頽敗不堪。隔了好幾年以後，才爲一些人集資購去，國以短牆，栽種了許多樹木，並略建事台，襯以假山，名爲翠園。其時新城倉巷嶺南會館鄰近，有一鹽商休息的處所，名爲小花園。在這小花園中，每天都有人宴集。在宴集時徵歌選色，珠園翠繞，眞個是銷魂之地。翠園之成，似乎很受了小花園的影響。不過小花園一直到閉歇，始終是鹽商的俱樂部，而翠園却曾開放賣茶，所賣點心，以盒子酥最好。因爲地方相當大，房屋不多，兼以花木扶疏，頗令人生城市山林之感。靠近翠園有一板橋通柳巷，此橋因即名爲翠園橋。可是揚州舊城茶社，生意總不會怎樣發達，因而翠園開放賣茶，不久以後，也就步戲館後塵而閉歇了。</p>
<p>翠園閉歇以後，也曾有一度租給　州鹽務稽　所裏日本派來監督的人高洲，因爲高洲有包車往來於小板橋感到不便，就改爲磚橋。到了稽核所另建新屋，高洲又離揚，於是翠園又變成極冷落的地點，在翠園未有以前，曾與小友在那里放風箏，翠園開放賣茶以後，也曾隨着家長去吃茶。及至高洲寄住其中，鬥雖設而常關，偶經其地，便祗好從短牆外眺望着裏面婆娑的樹木，疏落的亭台。</p>
<p>誰知這翠園在淪陷期間又換了主人。一時土木大興，竟將翠園改建的極爲華麗，變成一座私人花園。因爲新主人是熊氏育衡，翠園旣改爲衡園，連翠園橋也就有人勒石橋上，改爲衡園橋，到了勝利以後，衡園一再爲軍事機關借用着，據說將米要改爲縣參議會，大約衡園即當變爲歷史上的名詞。至於衡園橋在最近又恢復原名翠園橋，可是翠園已沒有了，翠國的一切景色，祗是給一班中年人留下一段回憶而已。</p>
<p>據說，翠園改爲衡園時，園中曾有兩株極名貴的牡丹，一紅一白，每開花必數百朶幹有碗粗，是數百年物，原栽在東關銜陳某花國中，後爲熊氏移來。熊氏離揚後，此兩株碩大無朋的牡丹也不知何在。榮枯存歿，莫能得其消息，或者和翠園遭遇到同樣的摧殘了。</p>

<p>秋聲像老遊各似的踱進國中來</p>
<p>念小園已充滿夕陽</p>
<p>山喜鵲整日嘈雜在樺樹上</p>
<p>此際久已樓空人散了</p>

<p>我徒追懷於過往的年華</p>
<p>你來而又去的</p>
<p>山中匆匆的行客</p>
<p>何年何月再來此小園駐足呢</p>
<p>任華髮綴滿疏星</p>
<p>你竟如天際飄渺的白雲</p>
<p>從來莫有舊地重遊的快感</p>

<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>關秀印白蘭，有「嘯餘草詩藥」，如柳絮云：「抱質輕盈是處宜，隨風飄泊下淸溪，日斜漁父朦朧看，庾嶺梅花略過期，」詩頗淸綺，第不脫脂粉織媚之氣。</p>
<p>「哀樂中年有萬端，不堪夢裏見金　，久知賤女成我錯，祗覺生兒似汝難；惆悵今宵空會面，沉吟往事欲摧肝，刹那縱識浮漚幻，孤枕殘燈自寡歡。」此錢錢嚴鐵橋夢亡女阿淸詩也。詩本發乎情，嚴詩尤出於至情者。</p>
<p>翁閣學覃谿，純乎以詩爲學者。自諸經傳疏以及史傳之考訂，金石文字之爬梳，皆君徹洋溢於其詩，洪北江輓翁詩云：「最喜客談金石例，略嫌公少性靈詩，」亦篤論也。予嘗見其「石洲詩話」一種，凡八卷，乃閣學視學粤東時，與學侶論詩所條記。施愚山謂其論詩宗旨，一如作室者，瓴　木石，一一就平地築起，固迥異於華嚴樓閣耳。</p>
<p>浦江叔能戴良，生値元季，貞堅有奇氣；縱崎嶇阨塞，卒不稍挫其志，洵忠義之士也。所作詩薈薈凉凉，聲情激越，多變徵之音。如營邱一律云：「空壕廢堞繞營邱，一望悽然使我愁，賜履封侯千古在，委端當業此時休；鴉啼古木西樛暮，雁落平蕪北海秋，回首江南萬餘里，異鄉如此爲誰留？」</p>
<p>詩固病在窠臼然能推陳出新，亦不至流入下劣。如九靈山人偶會一律其五六聯即是。句云：「百年世事醯鷄錢，一夜鄉心謝豹啼。」按醯鷄即　　，微蟲名。莊子：「丘之於道也，其猶醯　歟？」謝豹即杜宇，鳥名。禽經云：「杜宇啼苦，則自懸於樹、自呼曰對豹。」</p>
<p>宋張舜民倚賣花聲題岳陽樓云：「木華下君山，空水漫畫，十分斟酌歛芳顏，不是謂城西去客，休唱陽關，醉袖撫危瀾，天淡雲閒，何人此路得重澴？回首夕陽紅蓋處，應是長安。」筆意豪健，與老坡相近，後人尤愛誦四首二句，不知此二句乃出白樂天岳陽樓詩：「春岸綠時運夢澤，夕波紅處近長安。」文獻通考載舜民有「畫塲集」一百卷，奏議十卷，第自明以來，即散佚不傳。今所存者，僅自永樂大典中蒐輯　印之八卷而已。</p>
<p>張耒哭子殤一首云：「醫之不得其方耶？抑其命有短長耶？獨爾能使我悲若此耶？抑爲父者皆愛其子耶？薈顱夷顙，秀眉淸目，今其存亡，其猶有鬼也，使無物，則吾復何思？其尚有知也，則夫荒屋野寺，風霜雨露，食息誰視汝也？」此樂府歌詞之以至情流露，不可或假者，非若吟風弄月，可以妝點而成也。</p>
<p>魏程曉詩云：「今世褦襶子，觸熱到人家。」字書褦２，音耐戴，原義暑月所戴凉笠，以靑繪綴其檐而蔽日者，今謂世之不曉事者曰褦襶。頃讀張耒詩，亦有「頗遭褦襶驚午夢」句，想即脫胎於程詩。太白送王屋山人還山有云：「五月造我語，知非怡儗人」。翁方綱謂佁儗音義，並與褦襶相似，太白亦用程詩，實則李供奉詩，乃用司馬相如大人賦：「沛艾赳螑，仡以佁儗」。怡讀如熾，儗讀如膩。觸熱一語，後見關漢卿謝天香雜劇中亦曾用之，其第一折一煞有云：「我去這觸然也似官人行將禮數使。」</p>
<p>奎律髓載楊萬里言，謂肥仙詩自然，確是　論。肥仙，南宋人所以稱張耒也。　著「柯山集」五十卷，詩佔過半。律詩中如秋興一聯云：「佳樹已彫今歲葉，西風還是去年秋」；和柳郞中舒州潛庵云：「野鶴避人巢古木，淸猿乘月嘯寒嚴」；夏日云：「蝶衣晒粉花枝午，蛛網添絲屋角晴」；和周康彥云：「新月已生飛鳥外，落霞更在夕陽西」。詩格淸新自然，非善於體物者不能出此。</p>
<h3>生死之間</h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>當病勢轉入危險期時，三哥派車和亞萌將我送入醫院。那時精神雖常爲病痛所攪亂，心情倒意外的淸朗，但四肢已軟弱無力，想作點事，說點話，已經心有餘而力不足了。</p>
<p>病如果早五六天去診，不僅手術可以隨時施行，痛苦也可以减輕，更不致會如此的危險了。這完全是我自己躭擱下來的。最初，我沒料到是盲腸炎，也想去檢查一番，可是手頭沒有錢。</p>
<p>躺在病榻上，我一夜不曾安眠。勤懇的護士，一會兒來試溫度，一刻調換冰袋，我睜開眼，瞧着她們臉上的愁容她們在耳語，我髣髴聽到一些不利的字句，找知道我床欄上已懸起一塊「禁絕食物」的小牌。恐怖的疑慮一再聲着我，我預感到我的末日，我的神志頃刻頽喪了！</p>
<p>我後悔，前些日子，還能言談時，爲什麽不請朋友爲我書一紙遺囑，這樣的死亡，不是等於一種可憐的脫逃麽？有許多事，我還有一些話要說。</p>
<p>幾天後，我的病痛輕淡了，心神異常的舒適。我想，這也許是一個人死前的迴光反照，可是，這麽的死去，宛如夢幻一般，倒也十分恬靜，在個人，也算得上飄然的超脫罷－我等待着，我將要看到另外一個世界！那麽的自然，我一點都不苦惱，靜待着生與死的交代！</p>
<p>我的境界，淸靜而安泰，沒有絲毫紛擾，世間一切都和我隔絕了，我再看一到，想不到什麼，靜靜的夜，就在這靜靜的夜裏我的靈魂將離開我的肉體！</p>
<p>五百西西的鹽水針正在注射，我驚醒了。我發覺我還活着，而且有活的希望。床　，有親朋送來的禮物和鮮花，醫師和護士們全帶着一付笑容，問我是否止痛？睡眠怎樣？我微微點首，表示還好。</p>
<p>一片陽光，正晒着我的床褥，使人感到春的到臨。一會兒亞萌來了，三哥也來了，幷且接續來了許多親戚朋友，他們說到許多人患盲腸炎的經過，怎樣得的，怎樣開刀，怎樣復元，從不曾提到一個死字。我明知道他們是在給我精神上以鼓勵，我也感覺無限的溫暖。他們希望我活着，看着我，聽着我的說話。而我對於生之意義，至少有三十餘年的實感了；生的快樂，祗有活着的人，才能體味，才能享有的啊！</p>
<p>生的慾念重新盤據了我的靈魂，我依然活下去！雖然我已有了死的體騐了，那麽恬靜，那麽自然</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血512</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「佩服佩服！」鶴見用誇贊小老虎一樣的詞句，恭維了這位小姐。「您拳法高明得很。</p>
<p>「沒有關係！」她淡淡地，却是滿面笑容；還說，邊自坐到原位上，把　下的手槍，往身邊小圓桌上放下；</p>
<p>「我還有兩句話請敎！」</p>
<p>「很好，很好，」鶴見也坐下了，　出了一方手絹擦着，「有什麽話，您繼管賜教罷</p>
<p>「你別見怪：我想請問，您到底真是中國人，還日本？」</p>
<p>「哈…」鶴見一聽這突如其來的疑問，打了一個冷哈哈，就像一位于思滿腮的老人，確到一個天眞爛瘟的孩子問他；「怎麽你臉上長了這多毛？」一般情景；如要仔細解釋，不僅要南扯到許多高深學理，並且費唇舌，也不見得能說服這好奇的孩子。可是　兌一個冷哈哈之後，面上却又立即　罩了一層慘烈不樂的神情；因這問題，在他思考的機構上，攪動了一下，隨即就像了一根尖銳的刺，突地向他心坎的深處刺入，頓覺痛徹肺腑。</p>
<p>這根刺觸動了他的身世之感；他猛烈憧憬到他未見過面的慈母，追想到他爲國事奔走，積勞成疾，壯志未酬，半道撒手的生父。他憧憬到他兒時的異地孤寂生活，雖然有義母梅子的愛護，鶴見淸的撫視，小源夫人的親切，菊子的手足情意，然而心靈的深處，天然產生有種種不調協的色度存在着；這是無法加以慰藉的。</p>
<p>他對於這位女郞的問話，還感覺到一個莫名其妙的恐怖襲聲；因由這位小姐說話的口氣，可以推想到其他許多接觸過，或未接觸過的「朋友」們，安知他們對於他的身世，不也有這同樣的？」「在各人的心頭上？這個「！」安知不演成一種「察問又不好意思，不察問又不能釋疑」的猜測？</p>
<p>鶴見天性，固然磊落瀟洒，然而像這樣鋒利的芒刺，直入心坎，也不能不感到慘痛。就是其他所謂胸襟磊落的奇男子，碰到這相類似的創痛，未嘗不發生鶴見同樣的敏感，不過他似感覺在心，而表面上只是不動聲色罷了。設若眞個沒有感覺，那便心靈麻痺的人，心靈一麻痺，還成什麽奇男子？不就是渾蛋一個？</p>
<p>况且，鶴見的兒童和少年時期，完全在一個扁狹思想的日本社會習氣中長成，要呌他能怎樣特別超脫這種後天的教育勢力範疇，做到十分曠達不屬地步，未免呌人有些相信不過。他這時聽了這位古怪小姐的一問，心境上不能不感到一陣慘痛。可是他不想用言語來替自己分析。他知道愈分析愈將呌人生疑，他想用客觀的方式來證明一下。正在這還沒抓住一個客觀方式的當口，房中的電話鈴聲，陡地打破了這個尷尬而又沉悶的局面。</p>
<h3>異哉「無謂之戰爭」</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>英國前首相邱吉淾日　前在蘇格關埃爾城接受市　權時，發表演說，宣稱第二次世界大戰乃一切戰爭中最易制止的戰爭。他又追述一九四三他和美國故總統　斯　的對答：羅問此次大戰，應取何名。邱答「第二次世界火戰應稱之爲無謂」戰爭」。我們不知道原文是句什麽話，祗看有此報導上譯之爲「不必要之戰爭」，可知中文與它的原意不會會差多遠了。</p>
<p>邱氏說出這一句話來，令人欽佩他不是一位誇耀過去功　的英雄。因爲第二次大戰倘然眞是一件無謂之事，他那時候撑持危局使英國渡過危機的一番作爲，也就變成一件不足　哉的陳跡了。奇怪的是他何以對於二次大戰竟懷抱這樣的觀念，而且在大　尚在進行之中，竟如此坦白的向同明國的盟主羅斯福來說出來。胸襟偉大的羅氏，未必會因此感到侮辱，可是老邱肚子裏的心思，大濤經看出來了。老邱根本沒有把她國這個敵人放在心上。</p>
<p>可是這句話在抗戰八年的中國人聽來，總覺得它侮辱了這一次戰爭中流過血流過汗的無數前綫士兵興後方的老百姓，尤其是侮辱了我們中國抵抗侵略爭取解放的神聖意義。我們是被逼了掌起槍來抵抗的，絕無一時權術存在其中。這先一個民族自衛戰，與邱氏的所謂容易制止或不易制止截然是兩件事情。</p>
<p>話雖如此說，邱氏的話，却也有其警惕的作用。他把勝利之菓　得一個錢都不値，我們又如何呢？我們有沒有將它丟在角裏，讓它潰爛？倘然如此，則我們的態度又何異於他的一筆抹煞？也許他們不過是老頭兒一句頑固的話，賓際却在珍愛並且充分利用這些菓子的。</p>
<p>這是一句可怕的話。是勝利兩年後由一個大胆的老人公開說出來了。它否定了二次大戰的意義。我們不要讓這句括的心境傳染開來才好，丙爲這究竟不是應該不應該說的問題！</p>
<p>自由淡</p>
<h3>安哥拉鬧鬼</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>前幾天，中央社的土京安哥拉航訊，報道英國駐土大使館鬧鬼的消息，原文繪聲繪色，不厭其詳，大意只不過是大使館陸軍關武官阿士萊中校的官舍，本來是築在墳地上的，房舍之下，有回敎牧師的墓，覺在地下不時抗議，使這座房子成了凶宅，更使臨時屋主人－那位中校的美麗的太太，聽見鬼的聲音，看見鬼的顏色，（白衣老人）並且還和鬼談過話，說得那末活靈活現，若有其事，</p>
<p>假如這種鬼話，發生在迷信鬼神的回敎家庭或土國土著人口頭上，那本不算一回新奇事，最怪的是發生在外交團　要人物的官舍內，而且是在相信科學不相信鬼怪的英國人的家裘，於是使得迷信靈魂的朋友振振有詞了。</p>
<p>過云，我讀過伍遷芳博士靈魂的書，報紙上也記載過他　家人拍照時，他那位已死多年的夫人忽然在相片上現形了等等奇聞。</p>
<p>不多天，我在舊書攤上，發現一本孟憲承先生譯的一本「鬼語」，裏面記戴許多和鬼通訊的奇聞，這些都是二十世紀的新聊書，爲浦松齡所不曾有過的。玄學好像眞要抬頭似的，但不久也仍被最現實的科學打倒了。</p>
<p>其實白晝見鬼的事，在這人爲的鬼影幢幢的世界中，應該是「司空見愼」的了，又何止安哥拉一地有鬼呢？</p>
<p>大家看過「郞心發鐵」那張有名的影片吧，故事發生在也是一座鬧鬼的房子裏，也是呌一個年靑美麗太太怕得要死，但那座房子裏的鬼，原來就是會變戲法的男主人自己扮演出來的。</p>
<p>這世界，鬼比人多，鬼就是人，人也就是鬼，鬼者，歸也，更何必分判什麼人鬼關頭呢？</p>
<p>我對於安哥拉英國阿士萊中校的官舍內所鬧的鬼也作如是的聯想和推論，因爲它和「郞心如鐵」中的情節太相似了。</p>
<p>回敎可蘭經上每段開頭語常有「上帝把妖鬼驅走」這一句，其實倒應該改作「上帝把人　走」，才是正經。</p>
<h3>蔣英獨唱會　——著名抒情女高音</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>五月是音樂的季節，最近的上海樂　顯得那樣蓬勃，活躍，繼市府交嚮　團第二次演奏以後，國立上海音專於本月十八十九兩日舉行盛大的師生着樂會了，然而，一個更値得注意的獨唱會——著名抒情女高音（Lycric　Soprano）蔣英女士底獨唱會，將於本月卅一日在蘭心舉行了，這是她在上海首次舉行的獨唱會，我願以興奮的心情把這位飲　歡洲樂壇最近返國的我國著名抒情女高音推薦於滬上着樂聽衆之前　　蔣英女士是我國已故名軍事專家蔣百里先生的第三女公子，自幼酷嗜音樂，曾就讀於本市中西女中，她在一九三六年的春天隨父遊歐，一九三七年入柏林音樂院深造，至一九四二年畢業。於是從極負蔣名的現代聖曲歌唱家杜亞里果研究聖曲，適逢歐戰正酣，乃轉學端士，她一方面跟瓦格納歌劇專家柯嘉專攻歌劇，並爲柯嘉氏祖任助敎；一方面她又進蘇里克音樂院，從柏斯忌習理論，在一九四四及一九四五年中間，她因爲成績極好，被邀請參加國際音樂節出席演唱。</p>
<p>她留歐專攻音樂藝術已逾十年之久，此次返國之後，曾於本月十六日下午四時半，由本市敎育局長顧毓琇特假淸華同學會，介紹她跟本市文化界人士相見，在大家熱烈地歡迎和盛意相邀之下，她即席唱了兩支動人的歌曲——歌劇「卡門」中的詠歎曲及舒柏脫的「永生之歌」。音色淸麗，咬字淸晰，且富表情，流露着精湛的修養與造詣。</p>
<p>獨唱會定本月卅一日在蘭心舉行，這是她歸國後的第一次音樂會，演唱節目，共有德，意，法各國名家歌曲及著名歌劇作品，由國立上海音專名敎授馬哥林斯　担任伴奏，我們預料這次獨唱會將爲上海樂壇介紹一位出色的女高音，她底歌聲必將吸引廣大的聽衆。</p>
<h3>談救濟品</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰結束後，最使全世界人民受惠的，是聯合國救濟總署分發至世界各受災國的救濟品。此類救濟品，種類甚多，非但包括衣食住各項需要，還有機器車輛藥品等等，可說無所不有。</p>
<p>這些救濟品運至別國後的情形如何，不得而知。在中國，有行總和各地分署管理這事，種種情形，報上常常見到，不必多說。這裏只談談一般公敎人員和學校機關所受到的一些普通的救濟品。</p>
<p>這些普通救濟而，主要的大約只有衣食二項。</p>
<p>先談衣：救濟署所分發的衣，當然大都是舊衣，但照筆者所見的，舊衣也可分二類，一類大概是美國老百姓所捐贈，比較混雜，什麽男人的西裝，大衣，襯衫，女人的外套，褲子，長裙，貴重至皮大衣，蹩脚至破襪子，統統俱全。另一類是美國兵的舊軍服，呢質的，卡其的，布質的，還有美國女子服軍役穿的卡其衣裙，統統一個式樣，一種顏色，比較整齊。二類舊衣，前者雖然混雜，却比較實用些，尤其是西裝大衣等能禦寒之物。去年筆者在浙江某城居住，看見縣府分發舊衣給全縣公敎人員，爲了好壞不均，用抽籤方式，結果運道好的抽蒲西裝大衣，運這壞的抽着些破襪破帽子，有一位老先生，竟抽着一根「衛生帶」，弄得啼笑皆非，眞可謂「惡作劇」矣。至於舊軍服，有些破爛不堪，只好墊墊鞋底，有些很新，可以穿得，但外國兵身材高大，中國人穿上之後，像「薈蠅躱在豆殻裏」，不甚雅觀。再有一件麻煩的本：那些舊軍服，註着「鈕子退還」，因爲鈕子上有美國國徽，別國人不可穿，但那種鈕子，用機　軋上，除非將衣服剪成一洞，無法法除下，據說有幾個窮人捨不得剪破衣服，未除下鈕子，穿着上街，給美國兵看見，被逼今晚下不算，還吃了二個耳光。此事不知確否？如若眞的，亦可悲矣。</p>
<p>再談食，救濟署所分發出來的食物，種類之繁多，簡直令人吃驚，除了主　米麥豆灶之外，那堆積臺山　的鐵頭食物，真呌人眼花撩亂。什麼牛奶，肉類，水葉，糖醬，……眞是三日三夜也數不淸１當然，這些食物都是好吃而寓於滋養料的，都是一羣窮苦病弱的人所急需要的，但八年大戰，窮苦病弱的人實在太多了，杯水車薪，無濟於事。筆者去年在浙江時，看見某慈善機關領到十箱牛肉，頓時有七八百苦人擁擠門口不散，主持人無法，結果分給他們每人一碟子，給他們「嘗嘗滋味」。</p>
<h3>秘密秘密</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>莉麗：「露絲告訴我你告訴了她我告訴你不要告訴她的那個秘密。」</p>
<p>佩警：「她眞是一個卑鄙的東兩！我告訴她不要告訴你的。」</p>
<p>莉麗；「是啊：我告訴她我不會將　告訴我的來告訴你的，所以你千萬別告訴她我告訴你了。</p>
<h3>從玻璃筷說起</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>如果檢查一下這個都市里的市民，每個人至少有一件以上的尼隆的製品，即使是一個最樸質無華的人，他也會有支玻璃梳子或是一個玻璃牙刷。至於作爲一位應登小姐，那更能全身配備一普拉司得克」（Piastic）。從玻璃襪子，一直到玻璃別針。本來塑料工業家早已說過，這是一個塑料時代，但是它能佔有我們的百貨公司，却誰也不會想到它還會深入我們東方式的生活的。</p>
<p>聯合社前兩天從西雅圖拍來一個電訊，說一個呌做凡拉貢塑料製品公司，現在正以一具灰色的鋼製機製造着玻璃　，每分鐘可出十二隻，質輕如羽，顏色鮮艷，而且在華氏二百度時亦不會走樣。這批筷子大部將遝至由國銷售，將與中國手工業要筷相競爭。所以眞如其他尼隆製品之受國人歡迎一樣，聯合社記者最後預料它將在遠東風行。</p>
<p>看了這個電訊，其中有一句話是令人顫慄的，這句話是它將與中國手工業製筷相競爭。當我們的民族工業還充滿手工色彩時，這句話有太多的威脅，我們相信，玻璃鎮一旦東來，我們的竹筷和人造象牙筷就會黯然失色，因爲這些美麗的玻璃筷眞如聯合社記者所特別指出的是一具灰色的鋼製機造的，旣美觀又合乎衛生。</p>
<p>聯合社記者先生如果拍這個電訊不是預爲凡拉貢公司宣傳，那一定是滿懷同情警告我們的製筷工人趕快轉業，　　我們看，這是一個風球，他預示我們東方生活已崩毀就從這西方的工業製造東方的筷子起。魯氏</p>
<h3>俞陛雲太史軼事</h3>
<p>— 魯氏</p>
<p>太史字階靑，浙西德淸人，生於同治戊辰年，故小字阿龍，爲淸季大儒曲園老人兪樾之孫，而近代文學家平伯先生之尊翁也。天生異秉，體短膚晳，頭顱特巨，手可及膝，因有羅漢轉世之傳說，光緒戊戌以一甲三名，探花及第，　翰林院　修外放四川主考，嗣後運遭了憂，宦途不顯，淸　曁革益無意仕進，　居故都作寓公今猶健在，藍遜清　甲，如　果之僅存者矣。</p>
<p>戰前太史南來掃萬，寓西湖俞樓約半月，鬚眉如雪，絕類畫中老壽星，惟侍女雪兒給事左右，雪兒曼妙工詩畫。太史　注秀挺而　纎弱，雪兒仿之亂眞，索太史畫者半爲此姝捉刀，當月夜泛畫舫於湖山深處，太史度崑曲，雪兒吹笛，遊客　聲往觀者不識太史，翌日杭州盛傳有仙人不降，亦西湖佳話也。</p>
<p>晚年居北平，値政潮起伏，戰禍紛紜，著述之事，輟而不作，　遊仙詞百首，借間香張碩等故事。描寫世間男女情愛，極悱惻頑艷之致，異日平伯先生輯而付祥。則中國文學史上，將另有一家風格已。</p>

<h3>塔兒寺的生意經</h3>
<p>— 李朴園</p>
<p>西寗有過這樣的事：一個漢族或是回族所開的百貨店，有一天，有一個哈薩族去買布，因爲語言不通，店管伸出五個指頭，說明一尺布的價實，買主搖了搖頭，搯出五塊白洋，付了價，那時西寗洋價是十七元法幣對一。一個同志把故事告訴作者，我說：「這不一定是店家想騙少數同胞，而是語言作祟！」</p>
<p>塔兒寺晒經的前後，不單吃食，英國貨，印度貨，西藏貨，內地貨，都依着魯沙爾　的規定，在大路的旁邊兒，搭上一丈五左右見方的棚子，一個捱一個地接迎里把長，招得各種種族，各種口音，各種服式的人，整天蜂擁而至地買東西，就是在唱情歌那全部小山上，例如買賣牲畜之類的人物，也是到處散布着。</p>
<p>是個淸和明朗的下午，我同一兩個同志，出文華鎭往西，從另一個便通走上山頭，喘息還沒定，就看到一件怪事。眼前是一個牲畜市，蒙古羊，藏羊，牲牛，藏馬，靑海騾子，都用一條繩子，一端套在牲畜的脖子上，一端鑒在地下的靑草上－樣子很猾稽，好像風一吹就把牲畜吹開似的在牲畜邊兒，蹲着哈薩，番子，蒙古……各式各樣的生意人，其中有一個，二十多歲，細細的，中等身材，臉上血色很好，而有一雙相當聰明的大眼睛的人，彷彿從前在魯沙爾着到過的，也蹲在那裏，同一個賣藏羊的番子講價錢；這個人的藏語很好，他把手伸進羊主白板的羊皮袍兒袖筒裏的時候，他的動作把我們吸引住了，我們在看着他們。</p>
<p>講着我們怎麼也聽不懂的話，他同那戴着白毡帽的藏胞嘀咕了好半天，然後，很高興地向另外一個回胞請了幾句土耳其語，那回胞好像也很高興，立刻從他的腰包裏搯出十圓一張的法幣，由他轉交給那羊主，這藏胞的面部表情非常驚訝，講着藏語，要把那錢交回去，可是，那年靑的經紀人不肯收，好像還在諷言諷語地　他，譏笑他，那羊主氣了，旣然把錢送在經紀人手裏不肯收，他就丟在地下，立刻牽住那藏羊的　繩，蹲在那裏，經紀人彷彿要用强，但，看到了我們幾幾個穿草线制服的人，他退縮了！</p>
<p>我們了解他的心情，躱向山那邊的百貨攤子去，一路，我想着西密的那五個指頭，五塊白洋。</p>
<p>在一家布攤上問一塊英國嗶嘰的　價，他說：「賣給番子是六十塊國幣，先生要，給三十好了！」但，恰巧一堆玉樹一帶的女土司來了，我們替那布商不好意思，沒敢成交，趕快走向第二家！</p>
<p>啊，塔兒寺的生意經！你要邊　的少數同胞如何可以心服啊！</p>

<h3>National Government Promulgates Temporary Measures: Stabilizing Society and Maintaining Order; Prohibiting Gatherings, Parades, and Bypassing Protocol for Petitions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Government issued an order on the 18th: "Recently, commodity prices have fluctuated, affecting people's livelihoods. The government is actively preparing effective solutions to stabilize the situation. Unexpectedly, in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, some students and a portion of industrial and commercial employees have gathered to petition, making excessive demands and engaging in disruptive actions, obstructing public affairs, and hindering transportation. This is clearly intended to incite unrest, disrupt social order, and undermine administrative measures. If this continues unchecked, it will only exacerbate the fluctuations in commodity prices, leading to chaos. It not only undermines the purpose of public welfare but also brings disaster to the nation and the people. This is something no wise person would tolerate, and the government cannot stand idly by. Investigations reveal that the criminal law and regulations for punishing violations of order and public affairs have clear sanctions. In addition to publicly announcing relevant legal provisions to serve as a warning, the first temporary meeting of the State Council, based on Article 10 of the policy guidelines, has passed the following six articles of temporary measures for maintaining social order, which will be promulgated and implemented from today: (1) If people's organizations or students have requests to make to the government, they should submit them to the local competent authorities. If the competent authorities cannot resolve the issue, they should wait for the competent authorities to submit the request to their superiors for review and approval. Bypassing protocol for petitions is prohibited. (2) When people's organizations or schools petition, they should send representatives to present their views to the competent authorities. The number of representatives shall be limited to ten. Gathering crowds to coerce is prohibited. Violators shall be disbanded in accordance with Article 149 of the Criminal Law. (3) If students in various schools engage in strikes, marches, demonstrations, or other activities that disrupt public safety, the relevant educational and administrative authorities shall take necessary measures or disband them. (4) If people's organizations in various places engage in strikes, work stoppages, marches, demonstrations, or other activities that disrupt</p>

<h3>To Rectify Academic Morale and Uphold the Law, Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Students: Self-Love, Self-Respect, Do Not Fall for Treacherous Schemes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Chairman Chiang, in order to rectify academic morale and uphold the law, issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"The way to establish a nation places primary importance on principles and discipline, and the foundation of nation-building lies entirely in education. It is essential that schools have a good academic atmosphere and society has a stable order. Only then can the nation have a foundation for construction and the people have the possibility of well-being. Our nation endured eight years of the War of Resistance, with heavy sacrifices. Post-war reconstruction has encountered numerous difficulties. We rely on all our compatriots to share the hardships, recognize the facts, abide by the law, emphasize discipline, and fulfill their respective duties in order to complete construction, realize democracy, alleviate the suffering of our compatriots, and build China into a modern nation. Only then will our youth not fail to be modern patriotic youth."</p>
<h3>Communist Party Incites Student Unrest; Disrupts Social Order</h3>
<p>"However, recently, students in various places have frequently engaged in disruptive actions that go beyond the bounds of propriety, and demands that exceed reason. Abandoning studies and imitating each other has become a trend. Using the name of marches and petitions to disrupt public security, even seizing vehicles and hats, obstructing traffic, and disrupting order, such behavior violates laws and disrupts discipline. This is definitely not the work of our pure and patriotic young students, but is clearly instigated directly and indirectly by the anti-government Communist Party. The Communist Party is intensifying its armed rebellion in the north and is also intensifying its efforts to disrupt order and society in various places, creating a state of lawlessness and disorder, in order to achieve its attempt to seize political power and subvert the Republic of China. And those who are used as tools are primarily students in various schools."</p>
<h3>Students Should Reflect and Not Be Manipulated by Traitors</h3>
<p>"On this year's Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day, I pointed out to the youth of the country the Communist Party's plot to undermine the country, obstruct construction, and disrupt society. I clearly told our youth the insidious intentions of the Communist Party to disrupt our order, stifle our vitality, and prevent students from studying and workers from working. Today, I want to raise the awareness of all our young students even further. It must be understood that the subversive elements lurking in various universities are using various guises and slogans to incite and expand student unrest in order to carry out their pre-planned conspiracy of sacrificing youth and disrupting order. Observing the bizarre and absurd nature of this student unrest, which is unprecedented in any past period, our young students should use their clear intellect to carefully examine it and not be coerced or manipulated by violent traitors, and willingly forfeit the life of the nation and their own future."</p>
<h3>Unreasonable Coercion Will Never Be Permitted by the Government</h3>
<p>"The government cannot bear to allow innocent youth to be sacrificed for the Communist Party's conspiracy, and it certainly cannot allow the spread of illegal actions. The government, for the entire nation and all the people, has the responsibility to maintain public tranquility. All patriotic citizens have the obligation to respect national laws and discipline, and young students must cherish the nation and abide by order. If the actions of the people harm the interests of the public and the freedom of others, then their freedom will not be protected by law, but should be subject to the sanctions of the law. At this time when the nation's vitality has not yet recovered after the war, all speech and actions of young students and the general public must be based on law and facts, and especially on the premise of the interests of the entire nation and the people. Any action that disregards the nation's difficulties and strives for the interests of a few people, or even coerces the masses, incites riots, and uses illegal actions to make unreasonable demands, will definitely not be permitted by the government, nor will there be any leniency."</p>
<h3>Public Funds Are the Blood and Sweat of the People; Excessive Demands Should Not Be Made</h3>
<p>"Recently, some students from National Central University and Jinling University, due to the issue of meals for publicly funded students, or due to minor issues within the schools themselves, went on strike and petitioned, even besieging government offices and obstructing public affairs, behaving like rioters, which has gone beyond the bounds of normalcy. It must be understood that the system of publicly funded students in universities was originally a temporary measure during the war. After the end of the war, it should have been stopped long ago. However, because the Communist Party is engaged in violent rebellion in various places and the economic order has not been restored, many students' families have difficulty providing support. The government could not bear to interrupt the education of young people, so it continued to provide it, so that those who felt sorry for poor students were able to put forth their best effort. Our young students must also know that the source of public funds is the ancestral tax of the blood and sweat of the people. Today, the situation of our ordinary poor compatriots, who are not fed and clothed, and are hungry and cold, is unbearable to hear. The monthly income of soldiers serving the country on the front lines is much lower than the cost of meals for publicly funded students. From the War of Resistance to the present, the government has always paid attention to the essential lives of young students and has planned for them in advance. Therefore, during these ten years, although the lives of the general public have been extremely difficult and the national finances have been extremely difficult, the government has not only spared most of our students from hunger but also allowed them to continue their studies. The government has exhausted its efforts. If our young students have any sense of reason, they should not regard themselves as a special class and make excessive and impossible demands."</p>
<h3>Decisive Action Will Be Taken Against Actions That Destroy the Law and Disrupt Discipline</h3>
<p>"In short, the affairs of the nation are still extremely difficult today. Everyone should share the difficulties, endure hardship, and be self-reliant. Abiding by the law and emphasizing discipline is especially important. The dignity of national laws and discipline should be jointly upheld by all citizens. Schools are established to nurture young people and should be a model for the general public. The recent student actions have exceeded the scope permitted by national morality and national laws and are clearly directed directly or indirectly by the Communist Party. If this is allowed to continue, not only will the academic atmosphere be corrupted and laws and discipline will be destroyed, but the educational institutions that cultivate young people will inevitably become a source of destruction of the law and disruption of discipline. What is the value of such a school to the nation? And what is there to regret about such unrestrained and violent youth? In order to protect the life of the entire nation and the future of all young people, decisive action must be taken. I hereby offer these earnest admonitions, hoping that our patriotic youth will admire reason, understand propriety, know integrity, have self-love and self-respect, and not be harmed by the schemes of traitors. And the authorities of each school, who bear the responsibility of education, should all do their utmost to fulfill their duties, strictly enforce laws and discipline, and reverse the decline in order to preserve the vitality of the nation and maintain social tranquility."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Plan to Replenish Funding for Various Schools</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the replenishment of funding and equipment for various schools, according to Education Minister Zhu Jiahua, since the restoration, the Ministry has deeply understood the various difficulties within each school and has made every effort to seek solutions. As for routine expenses and equipment costs, every effort has been made to raise funds. However, due to the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the original funding received by each school has been far insufficient, further increasing the difficulties. Now, emergency measures and funding plans, including foreign exchange, have been formulated to solve the current difficulties of various schools. The government attaches great importance to this, and the Ministry will ensure that this plan is implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>

The date should be within this week. The selection of two vice ministers for the Ministry will be decided after discussing with Premier Zhang.

<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Taihang Mountains: Fu Zuoyi's Troops Sweep Westward, Heading Straight for Lingqiu; National Army in Northern Henan Recaptures Qixian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 18th] The National Army under Fu Zuoyi is sweeping westward from Laiyuan, heading straight for Lingqiu, threatening Wutai, in order to relieve the siege of Taiyuan in one fell swoop. In the mountainous area southwest of Laiyuan, at Zoumayi and Chajianling, Communist troops are transporting supplies and ammunition day and night towards Pingxi. The National Army on the Pinghan Railway is actively deploying, preparing to coordinate with Fu's troops when necessary to complete the joint defense mission of Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi, and completely destroy the last base of the Communist troops in the Taihang Mountains.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The remnants of the Hebei-Chahar Communist troops under Nie Rongzhen have mostly fled back to Wanxian and Tangxian. The headquarters of the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Military Region has also moved from Pingshan to Pingxi. After the National Army around Baoding was redeployed, the Communist troops are now gathering again in Sizhen. The garrison troops launched an attack today to sweep through Dazhuangzhen on the western border of Gaoyang. More than a thousand remaining Communist troops retreated south to Zhangdengzhen. The National Army is expanding its victory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 18th] The National Army, advancing north from Jixian, overcame the stubborn resistance of the Communist troops yesterday and recovered Hongxian at 11:00 AM on the 17th.

<h3>Communist Troops East of Mengyin Flee Northward: National Army Presses on Mingshui Station; Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming Flies to Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] The offensive of the Communist troops, who invaded the eastern side of the Xintai-Mengyin-Qingtuosi highway in the Yimeng Mountain area, has begun to be frustrated. The Third Column of the Communist troops, which launched a counterattack against Aoyangzhen southeast of Xintai, has fled back to Gushenbanpo northeast of Xintai on the 18th. The First Column of the Communist troops, which invaded east and south of Mengyin and Taoxu, has retreated to Tanbu east of Mengyin. The National Army is following up in pursuit and is dividing its forces to encircle and suppress the area east of Duozhuang. There are no more traces of Communist troops near Heyangzhen and the north and south of Zuoquan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] The Communist troops east of Mengyin suffered heavy casualties in a five-day attack by the National Army and fled north on the 18th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which is sweeping eastward from Zaotuansi, had advanced to the vicinity of Mingshui Station by the 18th, and the station will soon be recovered. The National Army, which is sweeping eastward of Pingyin and west of Feicheng, recovered Pingyin City on the 17th, which had once again fallen into the hands of the Communist troops. The Communist troops suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The main battle that the National Army has repeatedly sought is continuing in the four-corner area of Mengyin, Yishui, Juxian, and Tangtouzhen. The number of Communist troops concentrated in this area has increased to eight columns, about 200,000 men, accounting for four-fifths of the total force of the Shandong Communist troops.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] According to military observers, Jiaodong is the second largest base area of the Shandong Communist troops, second only to the Yimeng Mountain area. The Communist troops have established large-scale military factories here, and they can obtain assistance from a certain side across the sea from Yantai. Therefore, it would be an exaggeration to assume that the Communist troops will flee north across the Yellow River after their defeat in the four-corner area of Yi, Ju, Meng, and Tang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which circled around Mengyin to the south, continued to sweep through the Yiqin Mountain area on the afternoon of the 18th and recovered Binshan Town, ten kilometers east of Mengyin, after a fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Student Anti-Strike Movement Unfolds in Capital Universities; Conflict Erupts Between Students and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 18th] A student anti-strike movement is currently unfolding in various universities in the capital, arguing that strike movements should clearly define their goals and motivations. Initiating a full-scale strike due to increased food costs and escalating the unrest is considered to be a departure from the spirit of student movements. This anti-strike movement is expanding. Coupled with Chairman Chiang's address on the 18th, urging the rectification of academic conduct, and the Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order passed by the State Council, it is hoped that the student unrest in the capital will subside in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] This afternoon at 4:00 PM, a faction of striking students from Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beiping, clashed with a group of young soldiers on leave who had entered the city, during a lecture and poster campaign in Xidan, due to differences of opinion. As a result, both sides sustained injuries. Upon hearing the news, Director Li of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, in addition to ordering Division Commander Wu of the youth army to investigate and punish the soldiers responsible, also sent personnel to express condolences to the injured students.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Today, Peking University students clashed with soldiers from the 208th Division while conducting an anti-civil war and anti-famine campaign in the streets. Striking students from Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beiyang University, and other schools, mobilized in teams today to deliver lectures and post slogans and cartoons throughout the city, shouting slogans such as "Oppose civil war" and "Oppose famine." Among them, a team of over a hundred students from Peking University arrived at Xidan Guai Bei at 5:00 PM, dividing into groups to lecture and post slogans. Suddenly, they received a report that several classmates in Xidan had been assaulted. The students immediately gathered, leading to another clash with dozens of uniformed personnel riding in trucks. The scene was extremely chaotic at the time, and the military police were unable to quell the situation. Several students were injured, the most seriously wounded being Zhang Qiliang, a freshman in the Department of Land and Trade at Peking University, who sustained a severe head injury. After the incident, Chen Xueping, the Dean of Students at Peking University, and Secretary-General Zheng Tianting rushed to the scene. Chen Xueping told the students that he would negotiate with the Beiping Executive Headquarters on their behalf. Zhang, who was seriously injured, was taken to Peking University Hospital for treatment. The exact number of those injured today has not yet been determined. In addition, during the melee, the driver of a streetcar parked nearby was also beaten, and a Tsinghua University school bus traveling near Xisi was attacked, with a passenger beaten and the bus vandalized.</p>
<p>Li Zongren States: Severely Punish the Perpetrators</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] After the incident of Peking University students being assaulted, the reporter visited Director Li Zongren of the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Li stated that he attached great importance to the incident and had immediately informed Chief of Staff Wang Hongzhao and summoned Wu Xiaoya, the Division Commander of the 208th Youth Army, to inquire about the details. He vowed to severely punish the perpetrators according to the law.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Hu Shi, the President of Peking University, was unwilling to express much opinion regarding the conflict between the university's students and the 208th Division, only saying that it was a truly unfortunate incident. Dean of Students Chen Xueping stated that the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Students at the Beiping Railway Management Institute went on strike several days ago to demand the restoration of the Beiping Jiaotong University. The Beiping branch of Beiyang University also went on strike to protest the relocation to Tianjin. Tsinghua University students began a three-day strike on the 17th to support the demands of students at the Central University in the capital for increased food allowances and improved treatment. Peking University and Yenching University are both in the process of deliberations. In addition, the Beiping Normal College established a committee to restore the university on the 17th, and the Beiping Art College established a committee to recover school buildings, both with specific demands and actions. A spokesman for the Beiping Municipal Council issued a statement today, hoping that students would be rational, discerning right from wrong, and not overstep the bounds of the law. Director Li of the Council also invited the presidents and senior officials of various universities to discuss persuasive measures. The Peking University authorities convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and issued a public notice afterward, urging students to consider carefully and not lightly neglect their studies. The original text is as follows: "In light of the strike brewing among our school's students in recent days, we recognize our teaching responsibilities and feel compelled to say a few words to you all. We are always concerned about the lives of the students. Recently, prices have risen sharply, affecting everyone's meals. The school is always trying to find ways to allocate funds and advance them in advance. Now, the food allowance is being adjusted, and the calculation of grain prices is also being improved. We hope that we can achieve a reasonable solution in this difficult situation. We earnestly hope that students will not lightly sacrifice their studies for this issue. As for the faculty and staff, although their lives are extremely difficult, they would never bear to see young students sacrifice their studies for their livelihoods..."</p>
<p>(Note: The last paragraph appeared in yesterday's issue of this newspaper.)</p>
<p>Students from Two Tianjin Universities Hold Emergency Meetings</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch of the 17th] Following the strikes at Tsinghua and Peking Universities, the student unions of Nankai University and Beiyang University in Tianjin held emergency meetings overnight on the 17th and decided to strike for three days in response. The reporter went to both schools today for inspection. No posters or slogans were found at Beiyang University, while several posters bearing the names of individuals responding to the Beiping action appeared at Nankai University. It is rumored that representatives from Tsinghua University came to Tianjin today to liaise with various schools, but the reporter ultimately failed to meet them.</p>

Only after this newspaper received his suicide note yesterday afternoon did the truth become clear. In his lengthy suicide note, he explained that his suicide was due to the oppression of life. His monthly income was only NT$4,600, equivalent to 184,000 legal tender. Daily life was already extremely difficult. Last month, he suddenly suffered from chronic appendicitis and was unable to afford the cost of surgery. He only sought medication from a doctor. Over the past month, he has accumulated a lot of debt. Recently, he received a letter from his wife, informing him that there was no grain at home and that his young son was ill. As a result, his chronic appendicitis suddenly worsened. In grief, he decided to end his life by suicide. The suicide note also stated: "My suicide is a kind of resentment towards society. Today's society has deprived me of my right to survival. This is not just my tragedy, but the common tragedy faced by countless civil servants. Chairman Wei is coming to Taiwan tomorrow. I am unable to go to welcome him. I sincerely express my regret. However, I hope that Chairman Wei will save the civil servants of Taiwan. Farewell, friends in the world!"</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Hunan Grain Coupon Dispute</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Way to Maintain Social Order</h3>
<p>In recent days, student movements have been erupting one after another in various places, and the situation is extremely turbulent. If the students' petitions are for pure purposes, their actions do not overstep the bounds of normalcy, and are also reasonable, the people and public opinion throughout the country will naturally be happy to support them. Regarding the current educational problems, this newspaper has published articles pointing out: in addition to sympathizing with the legitimate purpose of student petitions, we deeply regret students' acts of violating laws and disrupting order. Unexpectedly, the student movements in various places have not only not subsided, but have intensified. The government is happy to accept and consider students' legitimate demands, originally to protect young people; but the recent trend has clearly overstepped the bounds of what is proper and reasonable. In Nanjing, there has been the launch of the so-called "Eat It All Up Movement," as well as organized marches and petitions, and even the meals of the administrative staff of the Executive Yuan have been "eaten up." Schools in various places have successively risen up in remote response, with class boycotts and petitions. People across the country cannot help but feel taken aback by all these actions. At this time of national difficulty, stability is paramount and has become the unanimous demand of the country; we must not allow this turbulent situation to continue to develop. In order to ensure social stability, this kind of decline must be stopped as soon as possible. Here, we have some things that we must say, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>First, the maintenance of social order depends on the efforts of the masses. The class boycotts and petitions of students, if they overstep the bounds of normalcy, are naturally not tolerated by the people of the country. Other general people's organizations should also not gather crowds to threaten and disrupt public security. Today, petition movements are rising and falling in various places, with new tricks and patterns. They have already exceeded the proper bounds of petitioning. The purpose is very obvious: on the one hand, to make things difficult for the government, and on the other hand, to shake the hearts of the people. These actions are unworthy of mention. If the people have petitions to the government, there are proper channels to follow. Today's petitions rising and falling in various places are not so much petitions as "blackmail." Moreover, the actions taken violate laws and disrupt order. In nature, they have already violated criminal statutes and should bear criminal responsibility. Since it is "blackmail," we have long hoped that the government can take more severe measures to put out this declining trend. This trend must not be allowed to continue, for the sake of protecting the foundation of the country. We have long hoped that the government can take action.</p>
<p>Second, from a legal point of view, the people have the right to petition, as stated in the constitution, but petitioning also has a proper interpretation. Petitioning is definitely not blackmail, let alone riots. Using the name of marching and petitioning to disrupt public security is especially not allowed by national law. We must not think that because the constitution has provisions for the people's right to petition, we can abuse this right and even hold the national law in our own hands. For the dignity of national law, we must not adopt a policy of indulgence. Adopting this policy is tantamount to showing the government's incompetence.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel gratified when we read President Chiang's proclamation issued yesterday. On the one hand, the proclamation shows how much the government cares for the people, with earnest exhortations. On the other hand, it clearly points out that the recent trends are a consistent conspiracy of the communists. It also indicates that the government will adopt strict policies to deal with these events in the future, to maintain law and order and to reverse the tide. This statement is in line with our long-held wishes. At the same time, the Provisional State Council of the National Government Committee yesterday also passed six articles of temporary measures to maintain social order, stipulating that people's organizations or school students should apply to the local competent authorities and may not petition over levels; in the event of a petition, they should send representatives to present their opinions to the competent authorities, with the number of people limited to ten, and they may not gather crowds to coerce, otherwise they will be punished according to law; if students boycott classes or other disturbances of public order occur, the competent authorities should take necessary measures or disband them; if people's organizations strike or other disturbances of public order occur, they should take necessary measures or disband them; if necessary, the local government should also take emergency measures. Judging from the above points, it can be seen that the nature of these measures is somewhat similar to the various emergency measures taken in the past. With the promulgation of these measures, we hope that they can be effectively implemented to achieve the practical effect of maintaining social order.</p>
<p>Here, we also have to point out that in order for these measures to be effective, everyone must rise up and assist in their respective positions. Young people are full of enthusiasm, and often their emotions fail to overcome their reason. The responsibility of the principal or the school lies in enlightening their reason, so that they do not act blindly. This is the responsibility of the principal to maintain social order. Parents also have the responsibility to teach their children, and they cannot completely push this responsibility to the school. As for the general society, it should also express its views and distinguish right from wrong. In times of turmoil, heavy penalties should be used, as the ancients have long said. Today, if we want to maintain social order, this point must not be ignored. It is in this sense that we believe that the temporary measures to maintain social order are a timely move. At a time when the country is facing many difficulties, the people of the whole country should especially uphold the government's good intentions and rise up together to assist, so that the maintenance of social order will not be an impossible task.</p>

<h3>Greece Determined to Cooperate Closely with Turkey to Prevent Aggression: Will Use U.S. Loan to Reorganize Army</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Greek Prime Minister Maximos, in response to written questions submitted by United Press today, stated in essence: Most of the loan granted to Greece by the United States will be used to reorganize the army. He remains concerned about Bulgaria's belligerent and aggressive attitude, but now that it has obtained U.S. military assistance, the Greek people can rest assured and devote themselves to peaceful work. Greece's future foreign policy will be based on cooperation with Turkey as a fundamental principle. At the same time, most of the U.S. assistance will also be used for post-war reconstruction. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Q) How does Greece plan to use the funds loaned by the United States? (A) In order to restore normalcy in the country and cope with foreign aggression, we must first strengthen our military strength. Therefore, most of the loan will be used to reorganize the army, add supply equipment, and modernize it, so that the Greek people can live and work in peace. At the same time, it will also be used to purchase urgently needed imported consumables, raw materials, and other materials... About 30 million U.S. dollars will be needed to purchase food to make up for the shortfall in this year's harvest.</p>
<p>(Q) Turkish President Inönü replied to my inquiry, saying that the principle of Turkish policy is to strengthen cooperation with Greece in many ways. I know that Your Excellency's past administrative policy is also the same. Please tell me about the future relationship with Turkey. (A) When Tsaldaris was the Foreign Minister, I signed an agreement with Turkey in 1934. Since then, Greek policy has been based on promoting friendly cooperation with Turkey in many ways. Greek public opinion has also always advocated eliminating old grievances, promoting friendly cooperation, and living together in peace. The principle of maintaining close cooperation between Greece and Turkey is not a partisan policy, but a consistent proposition of all political parties in the Greek parliament.</p>
<p>(Q) Greece's territorial demands on Albania and Bulgaria have not yet been realized. How will Your Excellency seek to achieve this? (A) Greece will never give up its demands on Northern Epirus. This territory has not yet been unified with Greece since it was liberated by the Greek army in 1940. The Greek people are extremely disappointed by this, and it is also regrettable that the significant bloodshed and sacrifices made in that territory have not won the recognition of Greece's allies. Now, the Greek-Bulgarian border must be slightly modified before it can be guaranteed against Bulgaria's new aggression. The country is belligerent by nature and has invaded Greece three times without cause in the past 30 years, and its current provocative attitude is likely to harbor future aggression.</p>
<h3>Turkey Receives U.S. Assistance to Build Modernized National Defense: Entire Plan Soon to be Implemented</h3>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 17th] The U.S. plan to assist Turkey in establishing a close-knit defense military structure will be implemented next week, emphasizing improvements to the transportation network to facilitate the rapid movement of modern troops. A U.S. spokesman said: The initial consideration will be to improve existing facilities and build new ports, highways, and railways. Currently, none of the facilities can meet modern military needs. For example, Istanbul is Turkey's largest port, but cargo ships cannot sail directly into the port and must be transported by barges from afar. Officials emphasized that the purpose of this assistance is to guide the Turkish army to develop into a purely defensive organization, not to launch attacks. The result may be a large-scale reduction in the number of troops, far fewer than the current 700,000. This will indirectly improve the country's economy and allow retired soldiers to engage in productive careers. Well-informed sources said that from an equipment perspective, Turkey most needs trucks, anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting guns, and small defensive military equipment. As for whether aircraft will receive much attention in the plan, there is some doubt, as the allocated one hundred million U.S. dollars are not intended for this aspect.</p>
<p>Permitting U.S. Companies to Drill Oil Wells</p>
<p>[French New Open Agency, Ankara, 18th] The semi-official "Aksam" newspaper reported today that the Turkish government has authorized a U.S. company to drill oil wells in Turkey. However, if oil is discovered, the right to exploit it will not be transferred, as the Turkish government opposes transferring oil extraction rights to foreign companies. Well-informed sources said that the U.S. aid to Turkey plan cannot make Turkey change this policy. U.S. Vice President Byres recently criticized the government's aid to Greece and Turkey plan for coveting Middle Eastern oil resources.</p>
<h3>Turkish Government to Implement Purge of Extremists</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Ankara, 17th] The Turkish government is about to implement a purge to suppress communists and right-wing radicals, and will imitate the United States by organizing a "Anti-Turkish Activities" Investigation Committee to be in charge of this matter for a long time. According to semi-official sources, the government may first conduct individual indictments, and then implement legislative procedures for the entire political party.</p>
<h3>Greek Amnesty Issue: Proposing Two Counter-Proposals to the U.S.</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] According to well-informed sources, the Greek government will submit two draft amnesty proposals: (1) Guerrillas who surrender to the government before the date stipulated by the government will be pardoned; (2) Those who committed crimes on Crete during the occupation period will also be pardoned.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] I have learned: U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Mai Wei, visited the Greek Foreign Minister Mr. Cai Erda Lisi yesterday morning and informed him that if the Greek government’s amnesty of the surrendered guerrillas is beneficial to the current situation, the United States is willing to consider it. After the meeting, Mr. Cai Erda Lisi went to visit the King and reported on the current stage of discussion on this issue, and then attended a cabinet meeting to discuss the same issue. It is heard that the opinions offered by the United States are that the Greek government should take effective measures to curb the cross-border activities of terrorists, but the suppression of the rebellion should be lenient. The U.S. side further suggested that Greece should invite neutral observers to monitor the implementation of the amnesty measures.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Military Delegation Visits the U.S. on a Mission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Following the arrival of the Egyptian military delegation led by Egyptian Army Chief of Staff Attala in the United States, there are reports here that the United States will assist Egypt in establishing a modernized army. The most frequently heard report is that the Egyptian military delegation came to discuss loans with the U.S. side, while some informal sources say that closer military cooperation between the two countries, especially the defense of the Suez Canal, has been placed on the basis of this negotiation. Washington officials have not been able to confirm any of the aforementioned reports. Army officials stated that the Egyptian military delegation came only to inspect U.S. military equipment, study American training methods, and aerial combat techniques. In short, regardless of whether the Egyptian military delegation can obtain concrete assistance from the United States during this visit, the non-obvious benefits it will gain should be considerable.</p>
<h3>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Plans to Issue Bonds</h3>
<p>Aiming to Replenish the Bank's Funds</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th Special Dispatch] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will sell $250 million in bonds to private investors in June or July to raise funds for lending to needy countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] A spokesman for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development confirmed today that French Finance Minister Schumann sent a letter to the bank's chairman, McCloy, on the 9th of this month, offering a promise that France would provide the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with all conveniences to control the use of the $250 million lent to France. Schumann's letter was attached to the loan contract, and what it said was fully in line with the provisions of the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement. According to economic experts at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development: All countries that have signed the International Monetary Agreement and will obtain loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development must similarly provide the bank with all conveniences to control the use of the loans. The success of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development depends on its issuance of public bonds in the American market, so the above conditions are essential to gaining the confidence of American subscribers. This economic condition is purely technical in nature and should not be regarded as political interference in the internal affairs of the loan-receiving country.</p>
<h3>Train Derailment in Burma</h3>
<p>Nearly One Hundred Passengers Killed or Injured</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: A train derailed near Comilla in eastern Burma, killing 30 people and injuring 61, 20 of whom are in critical condition. According to unofficial sources: tools used to damage the tracks were found near the scene of the accident.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Demonstrations by Korean People During the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Meeting - Order Issued by the Chief Administrator of South Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 17th, United Press] The Chief Civil Administrator of South Korea, Ahn Jae-hong, recently issued an order prohibiting all mass parades and demonstrations supporting or opposing trusteeship during the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission meeting. This move is clearly aimed at the "Anti-Trusteeship Association," as the association is scheduled to hold a mass protest demonstration tomorrow. The association is led by three close associates of Syngman Rhee. Although Syngman Rhee denies any formal relationship with the association, one of the leaders of the association was the head of a group that Rhee formed shortly before going to the United States last November. The group is extremely opposed to trusteeship. Rhee told reporters that Lieutenant General Liu Yu-chung, the military commander, invited him for a meeting this morning. General Liu Yu said that if Rhee could not cancel the anti-trusteeship demonstration scheduled for tomorrow, he would resign and return to the United States. Rhee told reporters that he has no formal relationship with the anti-trusteeship association. He told General Liu Yu that due to the general opposition of the Korean people to trusteeship, no leader has the power to stop it. Lieutenant General Hodge, Lieutenant General Liu Yu, Syngman Rhee, and other Korean political leaders will gather tomorrow to discuss the matter, at which time U.S. officials are expected to make a final effort to stop the aforementioned demonstration. When reporters later inquired about this matter with Lieutenant General Liu Yu, he confirmed the order issued by the Chief Civil Administrator but denied that he had expressed any intention to resign.</p>
<h3>The U.S. is in an Advantageous Position on the Korean Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 18th] Although the U.S. military authorities here are extremely willing to make some so-called "concessions" to the Soviet Union in order to expedite the independence of Korea, they believe they hold three trump cards: (1) The United States already has a concrete plan, namely the Truman Doctrine, and the United States' proposal for economic assistance to southern Korea makes the Soviet Union lose face in northern Korea; (2) The reconvening of the Joint Commission seems to have attracted worldwide attention, and the U.S. authorities acknowledge that the current trend of world opinion will provide the U.S. delegation with extremely favorable moral support; (3) The living conditions in northern Korea have gradually deteriorated over the past year, and the Soviet Union has clearly found its position difficult to maintain.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Cloud</h3>
<p>Destructive Power Exceeds the Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] The famous American aircraft manufacturer Martin recently said that there is a new type of weapon whose destructive power far exceeds that of the atomic bomb, and it is currently being researched in the United States. This new weapon is a "radioactive cloud," which is released by an airplane at high altitude and does not cause any explosion. It is said that this "cloud" can be recovered after being released, just like the throwing weapons used by Australian aborigines.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten Departs for England to Attend Important Meeting to Discuss the Indian Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th] Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, along with his wife, staff, and Indian Reform Committee member Menon, departed for London today on a private plane and is expected to arrive on Tuesday. During Mountbatten's absence, Governor-General of Bengal Mookerjee will act on his behalf.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The important meeting between Indian Governor-General Mountbatten and British cabinet experts on Indian issues will be held at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire, 40 miles outside London. Parliament will be on its customary break for Ascension Day, at which time Prime Minister Attlee will be able to concentrate on the study of the Indian issue, and Secretary of State for India Listowel, Minister of Commerce Cripps, Minister of Defense Alexander, Under-Secretary of State for India Henderson, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Addison, and Under-Secretary of State Bottomley, etc., cabinet experts on Indian issues, will also not need to participate in parliamentary debates, so they can devote themselves to the discussion of the Indian issue. Prime Minister Attlee will personally chair all the talks between the Governor-General and the Cabinet. Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on June 2nd, and the Governor-General is also scheduled to return to Delhi before that day to attend a meeting of Indian leaders, so the results of the London talks are expected to be announced simultaneously in London and New Delhi at that time.</p>
<p>Partition is Difficult to Avoid, Britain Makes a Final Effort</p>
<p>Observers believe that the Indian situation has gradually shown that partition cannot be avoided, but the British Cabinet will certainly still try to make a final effort to give the British Cabinet plan of May 16, 1946, a final chance. It is said that the Governor-General's report suggested that Britain withdraw from India earlier than June 1948, but this statement has not yet been confirmed. However, judging from the British formal declaration of February 22 this year, the date of withdrawal from India will not be later than June 1948 in any case, so an agreement on the method of transferring power must be reached within the next year. For this reason, the British Cabinet is paying great attention to the meeting of Indian leaders to be held in Delhi on June 2nd.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union to Exchange Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: Conservative and left-wing newspapers here report that Britain will carry out large-scale barter trade with the Soviet Union in the next six months. The newspapers criticized American foreign policy, saying that Britain was forced to seek help from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Stuart Yan-sheng and Others Arrive in San Francisco</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 17th] Advisor to our delegation to the United Nations, Stuart Yan-sheng, and other Chinese diplomats recently arrived here.</p>
<h3>Marshall Strongly Urges Countries to Establish a New Charter for International Trade - U.S. Hopes to Reduce Trade Barriers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered today the opening address of the "International Trade [Conference]," urging countries to take a major step in establishing an agreement for the future international trade organization. Marshall said: Economic conflicts and trade wars inevitably lead to political divisions. Today, unity among nations is more important than at any time in history. Although the United States has created reduced trade barriers at the Geneva International Trade Conference and agreed to the final draft of the future World Trade Organization, the success of the great achievement depends on the full cooperation of all 18 countries participating in the conference. At the same time, the State Department released a report from Geneva, stating that the United States has begun trade negotiations with ten of the fifteen countries scheduled to participate. It is expected that by the end of this month, representatives of the countries at the Geneva Conference will conduct one hundred sets of individual negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 17th] U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton declared on the eve of his return to Washington: He is very satisfied with the progress of the trade negotiations.</p>
<h3>German Secret Files Released - Planned to Sign Armistice Agreement with the Soviet Union - But This Treachery Ultimately Failed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S. and British navies today released captured German naval files. According to the files, Germany hoped to establish a secret armistice agreement with the Soviet Union in 1943, without the knowledge of the Western Allies, while the Soviet Union continued to obtain Lend-Lease materials from the United States. Fortunately, this conspiracy failed. The files also revealed two other truths: (1) Germany considered using high-speed, long-range, six-engine new aircraft to bomb the United States, but in July 1943, because "the number of this type of aircraft was small and the effect would be insignificant, but it would be enough to encourage the American people to resolve to resist," it finally gave up. (2) German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz requested the use of "new air force weapons" (obviously referring to V-1 or V-2 rockets) to attack Allied ships in Gibraltar in the summer of 1943, but Hitler refused, and a dog-like air raid on Britain was launched that year.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the plan to cease hostilities with the Soviet Union was ever delivered to the Soviet Union. The full text of the section is as follows: "We can only hope for victory if we stop consuming troops on the Eastern Front. So far, this has bothered Japan, fearing that if Japan fights in the north, the strength of the south will be weakened, and Japan may not be able to collect the necessary supplies for both lines. The million-strong Kwantung Army of Japan is standing by, and Japan clearly feels the need to step into Siberia. The Soviet Union is obtaining a large amount of materials through the Far East, so the question is whether Japan's threat to participate in the war against the Soviet Union can prompt the Soviet Union to accept the proposal of a silent armistice on the Eastern Front, and keep it secret, without the knowledge of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union should still continue to obtain American Lend-Lease materials. This matter is worth sacrificing everything for. If it cannot, then an eastern defense line should be built as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>United Nations News Panel Meets Today in New York</h3>
<p>U.S. Proposes Plan to Guarantee News Freedom</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The United Nations Sub-Committee on Freedom of the Press and Publication will meet here on the 19th for two weeks to discuss the draft agenda for next year's International Conference on Freedom of the Press. The U.S. government has submitted a five-point plan to the subcommittee for consideration. The U.S. plan is the most comprehensive of the plans received, and its content is to ensure the elimination of various obstacles in the collection, transmission, and application of news in newspapers, radio, and film, and to require reporters in the world's major news centers to establish self-governing moral codes. The U.S. plan will be discussed by the twelve-member subcommittee at the same time as a similar, but simpler, plan proposed by France.</p>
<p>International Organization of Journalists to Meet in Prague</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The second annual meeting of the International Organization of Journalists will be held in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, starting on June 3rd for three days. Representatives from fifteen countries will number 240. According to news from the organization's headquarters here, the main item on the agenda of this meeting is to [finalize] practical measures regarding the World Charter on Freedom of the Press, which will be submitted to the World Conference on Freedom of the Press initiated by the United Nations next year for discussion.</p>
<h3>Franco Inspects the Barcelona Area</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 18th] Regarding Franco's current inspection in Barcelona, Spanish politicians are speculating about the reasons for this. According to qualified sources: Franco's trip may be related to the recent labor strikes in the Basque Province, or in an attempt to prevent the separatist movement from extending to the Catalan Province. Other observers say: This trip may be the prelude to Franco's action to depict and eliminate unstable elements in the Teruel area southwest of Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Large Aluminum Mine Discovered in Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 18th] Moscow Radio announced today that Soviet miners have discovered a rich aluminum mine in the Irkutsk region, and it is said that its reserves rank first in the world.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress May Stop Economic Aid to Foreign Countries - Vandenberg Says in Senate Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said today that after Congress approves the $350 million relief aid to war-torn countries this time, Congress may not approve other direct relief aid to foreign countries. He told reporters that he did not expect any other requests for foreign direct relief. However, observers said that President Truman may again request appropriations to assist countries most affected by war. Representatives of the House and Senate agreed yesterday that the amount of relief funds for war-torn countries would be $350 million, but with a recommendation that only $15 million of it be allocated to countries other than China, Poland, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and the Free Territory of Trieste. The case is still awaiting final approval by both houses.</p>
<h3>Internal Disputes in Japanese Socialist Party Cast a Shadow on the Future of Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>[International Press, Tokyo, 18th] The issue of the prime minister of the four-party coalition new cabinet of Japan, after arduous steps, was largely resolved on the 17th due to the Liberal Party's executive meeting's support for Katayama's appointment as prime minister and the Democratic Party's echoing. However, at the same time, another shadow has been cast on the future of the cabinet formation work, that is, the Liberal and Democratic parties' insistence on rejecting the entry of left-wing members of the Socialist Party into the cabinet as a prerequisite for the allocation of cabinet members, especially positions. For this reason, Suzuki and Kato, the party's left-wing representatives among the Socialist candidates for cabinet positions, publicly declared their separation from the Communist Party a few days ago in order to ease the opposition air of the Liberal and Democratic parties. Unexpectedly, the statements of the two caused a major problem at the Socialist Party's Central Executive Committee meeting on the 17th, and were severely criticized by both the left and right wings of the party. Therefore, the future of the cabinet formation work may become more complicated due to internal disputes in the Socialist Party. Currently, party leaders such as Katayama and Nishio are feeling unable to cope with this matter.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 18th] The executive meeting of the Japanese Democratic Party was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 17th. After weighing the candidates for the party president, it unanimously nominated Ashida Hitoshi as the party president, Shidehara Kijuro as the honorary president, and Saito Takao as the chief advisor. According to the meeting, the party's entire membership authorized the meeting to make a full decision on the selection of the party president.</p>
<p>Japan Submits Request to Build Military Less Than Two Years After Surrender</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] Only twenty-one months after Japan's defeat, it has actually submitted a request to establish an army and air force today. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official recently inquired of officials from various Allied countries about their attitude towards Japan's request to establish a 100,000-strong army to take over the tasks of the U.S. military and other Allied forces after the end of the occupation. The official insisted that this army was necessary to maintain internal order, especially to prevent labor strikes and smuggling. He pointed out that the general strike in February this year did not break out due to MacArthur's order. If the Japanese government had no troops, it would not be able to stop it. He also hinted that Japan also needs a small number of air force to patrol the Japanese coast to prevent smuggling. It is understood that the Allied governments have not yet responded to this request.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Delivers Speech, Discusses U.S.-Soviet Relations, Says People of Both Countries Do Not Want War</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in a speech today: There is too much talk about war and too little about peace between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In fact, the people of both countries do not want war. Only the mistakes of politicians can cause another war. The U.S. and the Soviet Union should understand that neither can dictate peace terms and order people to "take it or leave it." This attitude has no place today. In this imperfect world, there is no perfect peace. Major countries should not be too stubborn, and the American people should not be too demanding. The United Nations should negotiate with each other on an equal footing. This does not mean sacrificing basic principles, but please make a wise decision on what is a matter of principle and what is a matter of policy. If war comes, it is not because the people want war, but because those who run the governments of various countries lack the ability. I do not believe that politicians will go bankrupt. I deny that conflict is inevitable. I believe we can create peace and maintain peace. I also understand the difficulty of this, but we can overcome it in the end.</p>
<h3>Rumors that the Soviet Union Has Already Formed a German Army of One Million - Stalin Can Order It to Enter Germany at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stuttgart, 17th] Four-fifths of Germans believe that a strong German army exists in Soviet territory, waiting only for Stalin's order to enter Germany and establish a German Soviet state. It is widely rumored here that there are more than one million German troops organized by the Soviet Union somewhere in Soviet territory. They are still wearing German military uniforms and German symbols. Only the Swastika on the uniform has been replaced with the Soviet hammer and sickle symbol.</p>
<p>These troops are believed to be commanded by General Seydlitz and officers under Marshal Paulus, who surrendered to the Soviet army in Stalingrad. Their weapons and equipment are thought to be supplied by Soviet military factories in the Ural region. Every German believes that there were three million German troops in Soviet territory at the end of the war. The aforementioned number of one million is obtained by subtracting the German prisoners of war figures announced by the Soviet government from this number.</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, the general public's trust in rumors has been higher than in the news transmitted by newspapers and radio stations, so the previous rumors have been believed by most Germans to be true.</p>
<p>General Seydlitz's wife currently lives in Verden, a town 25 miles southeast of Bremen. Of course, she denied these rumors. A reporter from this agency recently visited Mrs. Seydlitz. According to her, she knows very little about her husband's recent situation. She only knows that he is currently in a prisoner of war camp for generals 40 miles from Moscow. Her husband sends letters regularly, and the stationery he uses is not the official postcard used by prisoners of war. Her husband's food supply is very good, and he can go out from time to time for sports games. He lives in the same place as Marshal Paulus and another senior German military officer who participated in the Free Germany Movement during the war. Mrs. Seydlitz also said: "My husband lives behind barbed wire and knows nothing about these rumors related to him. In fact, there is no army commanded by Seydlitz, or what the outside world says is that the German army that surrendered to the Soviet army at the end of the war participated in the Soviet side's operations. My husband is only the leader of the Free Germany Movement. He wanted to end the war as soon as possible, so he did propaganda on the radio."</p>
<p>In addition to believing that Seydlitz secretly organized troops in the Soviet Union, ordinary Germans also believe that he sent German officers trained by him to enter Germany with the Soviet army in 1945. These people have all held important positions in German administrative institutions and the Socialist Unity Party. Of course, this rumor cannot be confirmed, but it is known that there are indeed German prisoners of war who have returned from the Soviet Union in the German police in the Soviet zone.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant General Fukuda Ryosaburo, an important Japanese war criminal who was escorted to Shanghai from Taiwan at the end of last month, has been sent to the military court of the First Pacification Zone, and the court has begun investigating his crimes.

<h3>Collective Hunger Strike by Former Workers of the Hong Kong Branch of the China Bookstore - Requesting the Company Authorities to Resume Work</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] More than 280 iron-printing workers from the China Bookstore were sent to work at the Hong Kong branch by the company.

<h3>Representatives of Two Railway Lines Return to Shanghai, Expanded Propaganda Movement for Railway Protection</h3>
<p>Employees of the two railway lines previously appealed for adjustments to fares and freight rates, as well as employee benefits, and have obtained over 10,000 signatures from sympathetic passengers. On the 16th of this month, the general union of the railway lines appointed three representatives, including Gao Qifu, to take fifteen signature books from passengers, along with a request for adjustments to benefits, to Beijing to report to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and to request a speedy investigation to adjust fares and increase employee benefits. Minister Yu personally met with them and promised to submit the matter for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday, and comforted the representatives to inform all employees to work with peace of mind and wait for the adjustment of fares to increase employee benefits. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai last night. The union held an emergency meeting of all directors yesterday and decided to continue the expanded propaganda movement for railway protection on the 19th and 20th, urging the government authorities to take effective measures quickly, and appealed that the benefits of the employees of the railway lines should be promptly adjusted to the same level as those of postal, telecommunications, aviation, and China Merchants institutions. However, they were determined to bear the pain and maintain the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) transportation, so as to realize this reasonable demand as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Courthouse is a Clock, The Bailiffs are the Gears, They are Intensifying Training to Become Good Assistants and Exert Their Effectiveness</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] These days, there seem to be especially many criminal cases. The detention centers are overcrowded, which is obvious. Everyone is planning to travel or has already returned from their travels. Only the judges and prosecutors in the courthouse are racking their brains because of the many lawsuits. In fact, the judicial police are even busier. Chief Judge Cha of the District Court put it well, saying, "The courthouse is like a clock. The judges and prosecutors are the long and short hands of the clock, and the judicial police are the gears inside. If one breaks, the whole thing will stop."</p>
<p>Shanghai is, after all, an international metropolis. Especially the judicial organs are at least more grand in scale than those in other places. Take the judicial police of the District Court in this city, for example. There are a total of one hundred people, divided into seven shifts, taking turns to handle all the work of the District Court on North Zhejiang Road and the District Prosecutor's Office on Xue Liuli Road. The work of the court is relatively simple and easy, while the work of the Prosecutor's Office is heavy and technical. In countries with a sound prosecution system, the power of the prosecutor is above all else, and the judicial police are the assistants of the prosecutor. They are responsible for probing, investigation, guarding, and execution. They are also the ones who specifically confront evil.</p>
<p>Since the Constitution was formulated, the Republic of China has embarked on the road of democracy. In order to protect human rights, the prosecution system has been established, and it is imperative to make efforts to train assistants for prosecutors. The judicial police of the District Court in this city are already stepping up this preparation. They take advantage of their spare time every day to desperately study criminal and civil procedure law, arrest law, and detective studies. A sound organization can exert a high degree of work efficiency. The judicial police of the District Prosecutor's Office alone have to deliver more than a thousand summons and disposition letters every day. However, with the efforts of division of labor and cooperation, they still have ample time to study academic subjects and organize soccer teams and basketball teams to temper their body and mind. At the same time, we also hope that the existing judicial police of the District Court will not be complacent with this. The future democratic and rule-of-law Republic of China still urgently needs you!</p>
<p>The judiciary has always been poor, and judicial police are of course no exception. Their current salary is 170,000 yuan, plus welfare benefits, subsidies, etc., which is only about 200,000 yuan per month, so most of the judicial police of the District Court are still "bachelors" and cannot afford a family.</p>
<h3>Speaker Inspects the Four Districts of Pudong</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, accompanied by Secretary-General Xiang and representatives from the Health and Public Works Bureaus, inspected the Tilanqiao, Yulin, Yangshupu, and Xinshijie districts yesterday, respectively in the morning and afternoon. When the Speaker visited each district, he was warmly welcomed by the district chiefs, the chairmen of the district people's representatives' assemblies, and the district councilors of each district.</p>
<p>When the Speaker went to Tilanqiao yesterday, he visited the Jewish refugee area there. At the same time, he hoped that the authorities could quickly repair the badly damaged road surface of Fair Road in the district. When visiting the shantytowns in the Yulin district, it was found that the residents of the shantytowns not only lived in extremely simple and crude environments and had no access to sanitation, but also lacked daily drinking water. Therefore, in addition to requesting the Health and Public Works Bureaus to pay special attention, he also asked the Public Utilities Bureau to provide convenient access to drinking water.</p>
<p>In Yangshupu, the Sports School there will be relocated, so it is hoped that a central primary school can be established at the original site. In addition, the Yinxiang Hospital has now been taken over by the China Textile Company, and the residents of the district have requested that the original hospital be returned to the local area for self-management.</p>
<p>It was also decided that the Speaker and others would inspect the Wusong and Jiangwan districts today.</p>
<p>The Conditions of Shantytowns Are Not Only Simple and Crude, There is Also a Lack of Daily Drinking Water</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's Seventh Weekly Broadcast, Banking and Services, Expert Sun Ruihuang Speaks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Our newspaper held its seventh weekly special broadcast at the Hezhong Radio Station yesterday, inviting economic expert Sun Ruihuang, Deputy General Manager of Xinhua Bank, to speak on "Banking and Services." The following is a record of his speech: "What exactly is a bank? What is called a bank? The term bank, in its broadest scope, can include banks, native banks, trust companies, etc. The businesses they operate include: deposits, including current deposits, time deposits, savings deposits, and trust deposits; loans, including current overdrafts, mortgage loans, discount loans, and export negotiation loans; remittances, including domestic remittances and foreign remittances; investments, including buying and selling securities, and recruiting company stocks and bonds; safekeeping, including open safekeeping, sealed safekeeping, rental of safe deposit boxes and warehouses; and agency, including property management, insurance, and agency for money collection and payment. From the various businesses mentioned above, it seems that the business of banks is not only to accept people's credit and grant people's credit, but other businesses are equally important and mutually supportive and progressive. If a bank's business is not planned on a whole, and cannot be fully developed, the entire business will be affected. For example, if a bank can act as an agent for buying and selling securities, and it can operate remittances and various other businesses, customers who want to buy and sell securities and want to remit money will inevitably want to open an account at this bank. The bank's power to accept and grant credit will also increase invisibly. This increased power should be attributed to the service aspect of the bank, so a bank is also an institution that serves society.</p>
<p>Three Main Functions</p>
<p>Since a bank is an institution that serves society, its relationship with society is naturally very close, and the role it plays must be quite large. Now, let's summarize it into three points and talk about them separately: (1) In terms of social construction, society must prosper and must first go through a stage of construction. Construction requires huge amounts of funds. These huge amounts of funds can never be provided by private individuals. Even the government sometimes finds it difficult to cope with these huge expenses, so it must rely on banks to assist. (2) In terms of industry and commerce, industry and commerce are the main components of developing the social economy and have a considerable relationship with people's lives. Industry and commerce use their funds to increase the utility of goods, which can alleviate the threat of economic life, especially when raw materials and commodities are scarce now, it is even more necessary to ensure the smooth flow of industrial and commercial funds. The business of banks is aimed at industry and commerce, and they are constantly striving to regulate industrial and commercial funds. Industry and commerce rely on banks, and at the same time, banks also rely on industry and commerce. (3) In terms of daily economic life, banks also have a direct or indirect relationship with people's daily economic life. For example, their deposit and investment business is to find an outlet for people's funds, overdrafts and loans are to regulate the lack of funds, remittances are to communicate the availability of funds between people in two places, safekeeping and warehouses are to protect the safety of people's property, and the use of negotiable instruments and agency collection and payment are to reduce people's troubles in receiving and delivering money. All of the above are sufficient to help people deal with daily economic matters. Like banks in the United States, their services are especially thoughtful, such as handling real estate trusts and living trusts. As long as customers say they want a beautiful house, the bank can do it. If customers want to prepare for future monthly living expenses, the bank can also plan in advance. The relationship between banks and people's lives is even more intimate.</p>
<p>Taking Service as the Goal</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a bank is an institution that serves society, so its main task should of course be to serve society as its goal, relying on enhancing the effectiveness of services and expanding the area of services to promote banking business. The cost of business is, of course, necessary for its own survival, but it should not be too focused on private interests and neglect the principle of serving society. Sometimes, under certain circumstances, banks not only cannot make money from serving society, but even suffer losses. As long as it is beneficial to society, banks will not hesitate. Banks should conduct business with this spirit of service everywhere. I believe that unconsciously, they can gain the belief of society and the trust of customers, establish a good reputation, and business can gradually expand. Therefore, service first is the supreme creed for running a bank.</p>
<p>To Move Forward in a Standard Way</p>
<p>Banks evolve with economic development. The more the economy develops, the more developed the banking industry. As banks develop, the number of banks gradually increases, and competition is inevitable. In an environment of business competition, how can you win the belief of society? How can you achieve a noble position? It all depends on its contribution to society. Therefore, a bank must move forward in a standard way, starting with serving society. How can you be a bank that serves society? There are five things we need to recognize: (1) To be prudent in management, (2) To abide by laws and regulations, (3) To help production enterprises, (4) Not to seek immediate gains, (5) To treat customers as life.</p>
<p>Must Have Factual Performance</p>
<p>Banks serving society has become a slogan for running banks today, but this slogan is not just about advertising and publicity, it must have factual performance. This factual performance is not a matter of one day or one night, it must go through many years of struggle to be achieved. People in society should assist banks that are service-oriented, so that their service power can be strengthened and the scope of service can be expanded. How can this be called assistance? It is to recognize banks that truly serve society, and establish business relationships with them. At the same time, you can also ask banks that do not serve society to be aware and all embark on the road of serving society.</p>

<h3>Manager of Yongfeng North Goods Store Sued for Encroaching on Land Foundation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On January 1, 1946, eight people from Ningbo, including Li Xingkang, Li Xingshu, and Mei Zhongqi, jointly opened the Yongfeng Xinji North Goods Store at 55 Zhonghua Road. Li Xingshu was appointed as supervisor, Mei Zhongqi as manager, and Li Xingkang as accountant. Later, due to disagreements, the business was announced to close at the end of June of the same year, but Mei Zhongqi delayed settling the accounts until today. At the end of March, without the consent of the shareholders, he transferred the Yongfeng Xinji signboard at 55 Zhonghua Road and replaced it with the Renhehang signboard. Later, he moved all the clothes and other items in Li Xingkang's room to the corner of the stairs, forcing him to move out, and moved his own furniture in. Subsequently, while Li was out, he moved his luggage and other items to the Datong North Goods Store in Huacheng Lane on Yanghang Street without authorization. Li Xingkang reported this to the Yimiao Police Sub-bureau a few days ago. After the judicial section chief Zhou Nan ordered the police to summon Mei Zhongqi to the bureau for questioning, it was determined that he intended to encroach on the land foundation and moved other people's property without authorization, hindering others from exercising their rights. The case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Doctor Involved in Housing Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Chu Linxun Ordered to Move Within Three Months</p>
<p>Chu Linxun, a doctor in this city who served as the director of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Hospital during the enemy and puppet period, rented the house at 1827 Linsen Middle Road from his fellow doctor Wu Tianmin during the war to open Chu Linxun Hospital. Because Wu said that the house was originally the site of his Xiafei Sanatorium established before the war, and Chu's lease period had long expired, Wu repeatedly asked to take it back to resume business, but was refused. Wu then filed a lawsuit. The case has been judged by the 10th Division of the District Court, which found that the lease relationship between the two parties had terminated and that the defendant Chu Linxun should move out within three months. Plaintiff Wu Tianmin was allowed to execute the judgment provisionally after providing security.</p>

<h3>Professors of National Central University Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Student Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing, 18th] The National Central University Professors' Association held its fourth meeting at 3 PM on the 18th to discuss how to persuade students to resume classes. More than 40 professors attended, and it was generally agreed that sympathy could be expressed for the student movement, but an indefinite strike due to demands for supplementary food expenses was inappropriate. Therefore, it was decided that the executive members of the Professors' Association would verbally persuade students to resume classes, and that student demands would be mentioned when professors petition the government and would be advocated on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Students from National Central University, Jinling University, etc., to Petition the National Political Council Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang University Continues Strike, Zhijiang Student Unrest Also Not Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 18th] The Zhejiang University strike continues, and petition representatives have all gone to Nanjing. The Zhijiang student unrest is also ongoing. The student assembly resolved to authorize the student union to refute the principal's true reasons for granting vacation in order to comfort parents, and to question Principal Li in Shanghai. Various normal schools in Zhejiang, due to unsuccessful petitions to the provincial government, have organized a normal school association and have scheduled school strikes from the 20th. Also, regarding the "eat everything" movement brewing at the Hangzhou Art School, the school's student union claims that this is not the case. [Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing, 18th] Student representatives from Jiaotong University's school protection group, Zhu Bao Bin, Zhang Gong Wei, Ding Zhong Yan, Xi Zu Gang, Tao Long, Cheng Liang He, Wu Zhen Dong, Luo Qi Sen, Hu Guo Ding, Cao Guo Xiang, Zhang Hai Wei, Ding Qi Zhong, Hu Qing Zheng, Wang Zhi Sui, Zhang Peng Bao, and others, totaling fifteen people, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 18th. After the Jiaotong University principal and professors arrive in Nanjing on the 19th, a final discussion will be held, and they will petition the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan on the 19th. They met with reporters at 4 PM on the 18th to report on the purpose of the petition and its reasons. According to them: (A) The purpose of this trip is based on the last item of Minister Zhu's five replies, believing that there are still outstanding issues, so representatives are sent to Nanjing for face-to-face consultations. Zhu's reply was in principle, and we hope for details, so the petition will be carried out on the 19th. (B) The origin of the school protection is that the Ministry of Education discriminates against Jiaotong University, and the facts are approximately: (1) The Ping and Tang sub-colleges were divided last year. (2) The College of Science was also ordered to be closed last year, and after vigorous efforts, the order was withdrawn. (3) The suspension of the marine engineering and navigation departments. (4) The hydraulic engineering and textile departments may also be suspended, and the handling of the chemical engineering department is still under consideration and is extremely difficult to approve. (5) The Ministry of Education intends to rename Jiaotong University. (6) The distribution of funds to various universities is uneven. Jiaotong University's monthly recurring expenses are only over 10.5 million, while expenditures are 50 million, with a deficit of 40 million. (7) The number of faculty and staff is too small. From August to December of the 35th year, calculated according to the number of classes opened, the number of faculty and staff should be 553, school workers 248, and technicians 40. However, the Ministry of Education only approved 373 faculty and staff, 120 school workers, and 1 technician. From January to July of this year, there were 423 faculty and staff, 205 school workers, and 1 technician, but the actual salaries paid were even less than the approved number. According to the approved 423 faculty and staff, only 307 were paid, and out of the 205 workers, only 125 were paid. Therefore, there is a monthly salary deficit of 30 million, plus the 40 million owed in recurring expenses, totaling 70 million. Fortunately, the donation from alumni to build the auditorium was used to cover the deficit. (8) The Ministry of Education has set up funds for improving equipment and expansion this year. Jiaotong University has 800 million, but only 300 million has been issued so far. Tongji has 1.8 billion, National Central University has 2 billion, and Zhejiang University has 5.2 billion. (9) There are too few faculty and staff. National Central University has 5,000 students and over 1,300 faculty and staff, while Jiaotong University has 3,000 students and 423 faculty and staff. (10) Comparison of the number of colleges in various universities: Jiaotong University has only three colleges; those with four colleges are Northwest University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Hunan University, Guizhou University, and Yingtu University; those with five colleges are Northeast University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Chung Cheng University, Fudan University, Chongqing University, Shandong University, and Lanzhou University; those with six colleges are Wuhan University, Changchun University, Henan University, and Taiwan University; those with seven colleges are Sun Yat-sen University and Zhejiang University. (10) (1) All schools have added departments, increased classes, and built new buildings, but Jiaotong University is the only one that has not.</p>
<h3>Fudan Launches School Protection Movement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Students from various national schools in this city mostly express sympathy for the demands of National Central University and Jinling University for increased public funding and supplementary food expenses, but believe that continuing strikes and responding to the so-called "eat everything" movement have other purposes and have risen up to oppose it. Fudan students have already begun signing their names yesterday to launch a school protection movement. They believe that all demands can be made through proper channels to the school authorities and the education authorities and should not continue to strike or use the "eat everything" movement as a threat. The signing students are scheduled to convene a meeting today to discuss the next steps and may decide to resume classes today.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Jinan University Student Union, Wang Shi Hua, Missing, Kidnapped by Another Student Organization Within the School</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] According to sources from the Jinan University Student Union, the newly appointed chairman Wang Shi Hua was kidnapped by another student organization within the school at around 5 PM on the 16th and is still missing as of last night. Also, about 150 students from the school went to Principal Li Shou Yong's residence in the afternoon the day before yesterday, demanding "food." Principal Li happened to be out, and Mrs. Li was extremely alarmed by the sudden arrival of so many "uninvited guests" and jumped from the upstairs, causing serious injuries. She was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment by her family.</p>
<h3>Jinan University School Affairs Meeting Decides to Retain Principal Li</h3>
<p>Further news: After Jinan University President Li Shou Yong telegraphed his resignation to the Ministry of Education, the school's school affairs meeting urgently convened at 3 PM on the 17th. It was unanimously agreed that since Mr. Li took over the school when it returned to Shanghai, he has been working diligently for a year to build a scale and is now striving for progress. If he suddenly retires, the school's construction plan will inevitably be affected. Therefore, it was unanimously resolved that the association should represent all the professors of the school and earnestly retain him; telegram the Ministry of Education to promptly urge Mr. Li to return to the school and resume his duties; and send representatives Zhou Shao Lian and others to Mr. Li's residence to personally ask him to dismiss his intention to resign.</p>
<h3>Datong University Students Hosted Reporters Yesterday, Claiming They Will Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Datong University Student Union, in order to demand reform of school administration, caused a strike that has lasted for two days. The school has still not sent anyone to take responsibility and seek a resolution. Yesterday morning, the student union sent the eight major demands and various detailed items in writing to the school board, demanding a reply within two days, otherwise, they will go to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education and request that the school be converted into a national school. The union hosted reporters at the school at 10 AM yesterday to report on the strike process and the school's measures. It is said that the students in the school do not have publicly funded treatment, and most poor students rely on the economic cafeteria run by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to maintain themselves. Now that the economic cafeteria is about to be closed with the end of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, they decided to run a cooperative on their own two months ago to find a solution and submitted a request to the school for approval. However, the school has been delaying approval. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the second general student representative meeting was convened. Because the school disregarded student welfare, and summarizing the school's various unreasonable facilities in peacetime, it was decided to put forward eight demands: (1) Request the school to accept the four demands put forward by the economic cafeteria: 1. Resolutely request the school to allow the establishment of a cooperative and provide a location for the cooperative, otherwise, subsidize the cafeteria's expenses. 2. Please provide the school with a kitchen and three cooks, stoves, and fuel. 3. Please do not unreasonably interfere with the administration of the economic cafeteria in the future. 4. Please reply immediately. (2) Request the school to abolish all unreasonable systems. (3) Notices and publications with names should not be torn down. (4) Abolish all unreasonable fees. (5) Guarantee students' freedom of thought and freedom of assembly. (6) Abolish the student organization registration system. (7) Improve all facilities. (8) Request the school to publicly recognize the current student union. The above points were requested to be answered by Acting President Hu within one day. However, there was still no response on the 16th, so the strike began on the afternoon of that day, and they collectively walked to President Hu's private residence to petition. Mr. Hu heard the news in advance and avoided meeting them. To this day, the school has not sent any person in charge to reply, so it was decided to send representatives to Nanjing to petition. It is reported that Datong University President Hu Gang Fu is currently lecturing in the United Kingdom and is being represented by his younger brother Hu Dun Fu.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Professors' Association</h3>
<p>Decides on New Method for Calculating Grades</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Student Union, a private university in this city, launched a strike some time ago to demand that the school abolish the grade point system. It is now learned that the school's Professors' Association has formed a subcommittee to study an alternative method for this problem. After detailed research over the past few days, it was deemed that Chapter 7 of the Ministry of Education's "Regulations on Student Status in Specialist Schools and Universities" promulgated on March 27 of this year, regarding the calculation of grades, is quite complete. It was therefore formally recommended to the Professors' Association that starting this semester, the method of calculating students' academic grades should be handled in accordance with these regulations. The Professors' Association has accepted this recommendation. It is heard that after students received this news, they may attend classes today (the 19th).</p>
<h3>Provincial Shanghai High School Alumni Association Decides to Build Alumni Building</h3>

Principal Shen Yi Zhen reported on the restoration and enrichment of the school and the addition of a student dormitory. The conference then discussed school affairs and decided to build an alumni building, with a fundraising target of 800 million yuan and a payment deadline of the end of July this year.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Hosted Reporters to Report on Efforts to Obtain Supplies</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Educational Groups in This City Working to Secure Supply Allocations for Colleagues in Private Schools hosted reporters at the Da Xin Friendship Association on Liu He Road at 2:30 PM yesterday. Chairman Lin Rong reported on the association's petition process and stated that the three demands put forward aim to secure a one-time allocation of 1 billion yuan for private school subsidies for the first item. For the second item, the request for academic advancement fees will be determined by the municipal government and passed by the city council. For the third item, the request for the allocation of supplies, in addition to the municipal government submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for approval, the association decided to directly report to the Executive Yuan in the coming days to request it.</p>
<h3>Zhijiang School Affairs Meeting Yesterday Decides Not to Calculate Grade Points</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the Zhijiang University students' strike to demand the abolition of the grade point system, the school held a school affairs meeting yesterday (the 18th) to discuss the merits of the grade point system in detail.

<p>Letter of Correction</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper on May 18 that the Sino-French Pharmaceutical strike was in response to the "eat everything movement," which is inconsistent with the facts. The Sino-French Pharmaceutical Department requests the Ministry of Education to set up a college of pharmacy for the future of pharmacy. Because the Ministry of Education did not give a concrete reply, the strike was to express the determination to strive for it. The goal is simple and there are no other intentions. Please correct it to avoid confusion. Student Union of the Private Sino-French University School of Pharmacy (May 18th)</p>

<h3>Expeditionary Force Sweeps All Before Them: Expeditionary Wheel Wins Three Out of Three, Shantou Team Suffers Another Defeat</h3>
<p>The Fifty-Six This Thirty-Eight Guest Team’s Basketball Skills Advance Fiercely</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Expeditionary Army Luoyang Expeditionary Wheel basketball team is fighting more and more bravely. At 7 PM last night at the city gymnasium, they defeated Shantou Team with a score of 56 to 38, creating a record of three wins in three games after coming to Shanghai. The team's substantial strength and the remarkable progress in their skills are further proven here, which is admirable. There were over a thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The main reason for Expeditionary Wheel's victory is its strong strength. Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang rarely miss their shots, regardless of position, angle, distance, or proximity. In addition to the five tigers in the official lineup, the performances of the other players are also not weak. Last night, players such as Cheng Fei and Ji Decheng also emerged prominently. Shantou Team suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Expeditionary Wheel last year, and they originally planned to take revenge last night. However, their play seemed overly aggressive. Chen Qingjiang was the most successful player yesterday, and the rest tried their best. The situation was quite balanced within the first ten minutes, and it was difficult to tell who would win. However, after a score of 19 to 15, Shantou Team declined sharply and got progressively worse. In the end, they could not resist and suffered another defeat.</p>
<p>Shantou Team Fights Hard</p>
<p>The game began between the two teams amidst applause. Captains Cai Zhongqiang and Ma Shuoxi presented each other with team flags. Referees Jin Jiabiao and Xuan Hegao blew the whistle to start the game. Expeditionary Wheel started with Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan, while Shantou Team started with Ma Canxi, Cai Yanxiong, Chen Qingjiang, Lin Weicong, and He Lide. After the initial contact, Zhongqiang committed a foul, and Cai Yanxiong scored a point on the free throw, opening the scoring. When Liu Zhengjun scored, Qingjiang and Lide also scored four points. Shantou Team took a 5-2 lead, followed by a 7-4 lead. Tu Wenlong scored one point on a free throw, tying the game at 7-7. Qingjiang and Yanxiong took charge, and Shantou Team raised its head again, but they were soon forced into an 11-11 tie. Zhongqiang made a close shot, and Expeditionary Wheel took the lead. Shantou Team called a timeout, but it was ineffective. At 19-15, Shantou Team called a second timeout, but they still couldn't stop their momentum. At the end of the first half, Expeditionary Wheel led with a score of 24-16, taking an eight-point lead.</p>
<p>Momentum Like Splitting Bamboo</p>
<p>After switching sides, Expeditionary Wheel used the same lineup, while Shantou Team substituted Chen Mingyi for Cai Yanxiong. He Lide scored on two free throws. Expeditionary Wheel's Wenlong, Zhongqiang, and Ruizhang each made contributions. Shantou Team called a timeout. Yanxiong re-entered, and Mingyi was taken off. Expeditionary Wheel continued its momentum like splitting bamboo, and the score difference widened. At 42-29, He Lide was disqualified for committing five fouls. Lin Ziren took his place.

<h3>Hunan Province Strengthens Secondary Vocational School Association: Generous Allocation of Practice Consumption Fees. The Ministry of Education Believes It Is Essential and Orders All Provinces and Cities to Refer to It for Implementation.</h3>

<h3>Securities Firm Changes to Paying with US Dollar Bonds: The Amended Method Proposed by the Economic Sector Has Been Discussed Favorably, and It Is Expected to Open as Usual Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored that the Ministry of Finance had decided to maintain its original proposal regarding the provision that securities brokers' margin deposits be offset by US dollar bonds. A reporter specifically inquired about this matter with a spokesperson for the Securities Exchange. According to him, "I don't know on what basis that news is being said." He truthfully stated: "Since the Ministry of Finance and Economics jointly issued the order, the authorities supervising the Securities Exchange have been in contact with the central authorities in charge by long-distance telephone to discuss the situation of the stock market's response and the opinions of the brokers. The process went very well. The central authorities in charge are very aware of the situation in Shanghai and have not expressed any intention of insisting on the original proposal." Also, a responsible official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stationed in Shanghai also had a discussion with the Securities Exchange authorities once yesterday, and was particularly sympathetic to some of the factual difficulties. Therefore, the discussion went smoothly and satisfactorily. The spokesperson believed that the proposed improvement opinions submitted by the Securities Brokers Association this time took into account the facts and should be called reasonable. He stated: "The government and the Securities Exchange authorities ultimately seek to ensure that the implementation of any measures does not cause obstacles, and they will never want to ignore the facts and act arbitrarily. Since the Brokers Association has already prepared amended opinions for the Ministry, and the Ministry has expressed understanding and sympathy for the situation in the Shanghai market, it is believed that there must be a mitigated method for the payment of US dollar bonds to be promulgated. We are currently waiting quietly for the Ministry's order to be issued so that we can comply with it. Therefore, the rumors circulating outside that the two ministries insist on the original proposal are not factual."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Standing Council of the Securities Exchange recently resolved to forward the opinions proposed by the Brokers Association to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for review. Before receiving instructions from the Ministry, everything will be handled in accordance with the old method. Therefore, from the perspective of the Securities Exchange, trading will open as usual this morning. At the meeting of the Brokers Association the day before yesterday, the issue of opening trading today was hotly debated. Although there were differences of opinion, the atmosphere at the meeting ultimately concluded that, for the sake of the overall situation, it was still hoped that trading would open.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Exporting Chinese Tea Reemerge: The Export Industry Holds an Emergency Meeting, Plans to Formulate a Production and Sales Plan, and Hopes That the Central Agricultural Bank Will Adopt It</h3>
<p>The Chinese Tea Export Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the association the day before yesterday. More than ten directors and supervisors, including Tang Jisan, attended the meeting to discuss important issues such as the disposal of old tea and the harsh and complicated regulations for tea loans handled by the Central Agricultural Bank.</p>
<p>(1) The negotiations with the financial authorities on the government's dismantling of funds to purchase old tea from last year did not end as desired. After discussing the future course of action, it was decided that after concentrating the 70,000 dan of tea from last year, the Tea Joint Company would jointly estimate the price with the industry today, abandon those that do not meet export standards, and the rest would be jointly exported by the Business Committee of the company. It is still planned to request the government to allocate as much of the deposit as possible. (2) The Central Agricultural Bank's 80 billion yuan tea loan this year has harsh and complicated regulations, which are difficult for tea merchants to accept. It has been decided to jointly formulate a national tea production and sales plan for this year with the Tea Joint Company and request the Agricultural Bank to revise this year's tea loan method in accordance with this plan. However, the Agricultural Bank argued that it was difficult to change, so all directors and supervisors unanimously decided to appeal to the public opinion community on the difficulties of exporting Chinese tea. A committee was also appointed to draft a letter to social figures and to host the press at the Bankers Association tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to sources, the trading conditions of export tea in the international market are deteriorating. Export merchants are eager for the government to provide assistance in various ways. Due to the inability to dispose of the old tea from last year, the profit is willing to be put aside for the time being. At least, tea merchants must be given some guarantee. Tea firms in various places are still hesitant to produce tea this year, and there is no hope for domestic sales of tea. The market is sluggish, and market prices have returned to mediocrity. At the beginning of tea production, they have encountered this unfavorable situation, and operators cannot help but be daunted.</p>
<p>According to Dai Shengli of the Central Agricultural Bank, the government has always been very concerned about export tea and has strongly supported it. Commodity prices in various places have fluctuated sharply in the past month, but the price of Chinese tea has not increased. This is because exports cannot be expanded. Tea merchants may have already suffered losses. Financial authorities can consider purchasing it, but it is proposed to limit it to Qimen, Ping Shui, and Wenzhou products. The tea loan method may be too strict, but this is because the handling of last year's tea loan was not good, and it had to be done this way. Chen, the new deputy director of the Wheelchair Association, served as the director of the Trade Commission during the Anti-Japanese War and handled the purchase of a large number of tea leaves, so Chen will definitely be able to do his best to solve the difficulties in exporting. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is scheduled to end in September, with only four months left. There are still a large number of relief supplies stipulated to be shipped to our country, which are being actively rushed. It is estimated that they will be shipped before September this year.</p>
<p>It is understood that agricultural and fishery materials are more common among them. For example, after 1,000 tons of cotton seeds arrive in China, they will be distributed to disaster-stricken farmers in various places at no cost. There are 225,000 tons of fertilizer, half of which will be sold and half of which will be distributed. There are 1,500 sets of tractors to help disaster-stricken farmers reclaim land. There are 1.3 million pieces of small farm implements, which are also prepared to be distributed to disaster-stricken farmers. There are 1,800 diesel engines, which will be sold to the Agricultural Reclamation Office at a price. Oil and water machines. 777 well drilling machines will also be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Agricultural Reclamation Office at a price.</p>
<p>20 cotton gins, 20 flour machines, 20 oil presses, and 150 tons of small canning equipment will be distributed to various places. 3,127 tons of active prevention and control of diseases, insect pests, veterinary medicine, and machinery will be distributed to various places to prevent and control diseased livestock and epidemics. 164 fishing vessels and 90,000 tons of fishing gear will be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fishery Management Office at a price. There are also 1,000 water buffaloes, which will be sold publicly at a price. Currently, Chen Cun in various parts of our country needs these materials, so he is extremely eager for the UNRRA to ship them as soon as possible and distribute them for application.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade Activities: Japanese Merchants Can Lend Goods to the Bureau of Commerce. The Bureau Will Approve the Re-export to Foreign Countries.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to diplomatic sources, the American Commercial Company was originally the agent of the Allied Headquarters for controlling Japanese trade. The company recently stated that, regarding Japanese foreign trade matters, except for cotton textiles, inquiries for other commodities can be directly contacted by Japanese merchants or the Japanese government's Bureau of Commerce, or the Allied Headquarters' Foreign Trade Group, from now on. However, for transaction procedures, Japanese merchants still cannot handle them directly. They must first sell the goods to be sold to the Japanese government's Bureau of Commerce, which will act as an agent and resell them to foreign purchasers after approval from the headquarters. According to the Japanese foreign trade affairs, since the occupation, they have been under the control of the Allied Headquarters, and the US government has designated the American Commercial Company as the agent to undertake all import and export trade for the headquarters. Recently, the company announced that the restrictions on postal communications with Japan in various countries have been relaxed by the headquarters since January 2 of this year, allowing the use of postal and telegraphic services for the exchange of commercial information. Therefore, the above-mentioned measures have been adopted.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Will Soon Be Available for Purchase. The Authorities Have Not Yet Decided on the Amount of Wheat Purchase Loans.</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Flour Industry Association submitted a statement to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week. They requested instructions on this year's wheat purchase plan from relevant agencies such as the Fourth Joint Administration Office and requested that flour and wheat loans be organized as soon as possible, hoping to lend 300 billion yuan, but no reply has been received yet.</p>
<p>Rong Yiren, the person in charge of the industry, visited Beijing a few days ago to exchange opinions informally with the authorities of the Ministry of Food in order to facilitate the process. At the same time, the industry has approached the Bank of Communications, which participated in the wheat loan last year, to continue to assist in the purchase. However, since the entire wheat purchase plan and loan amount must be approved by the Ministry of Food, and the new wheat will be launched in early June, the preparatory work for all parties has not seen progress. In addition, the recent personnel changes in the central government have caused delays in the issuance of concrete statements, and flour mills are very anxious.</p>
<p>Currently, the factory is based on the consumption in this city and its suburbs to make statistics, and believes that each factory in this city needs at least 100 billion yuan to turn around. After consecutive days of talks with the financial authorities, it has been confirmed that this wheat loan is indeed very important. Each factory has decided that if the authorities still have not made any decisions within the week, each manufacturer will independently raise funds and go to the production area to purchase wheat in order to increase production and supply foreign exchange needs.</p>
<h3>Central Agricultural Bank Holds Grain Production Loans</h3>
<p>The Chinese Farmers Bank plans to launch grain production loans in order to increase grain production. In addition to ordinary loans, it also plans to allocate more loans to counties in the pacification area and the Pan area of the Yellow River and Huai River to help farmers resume cultivation and increase grain supply. The loan is limited to purchasing seeds, fertilizers, cattle, and farm implements. It is learned that the case has been approved by the Fourth Joint Administration Office and allocated for lending within a limit of 200 billion yuan, and it is approved to re-mortgage to the National Bank at a 10% discount.</p>
<h3>Exporters Request Postponement of Settlement Period for Consignment Goods</h3>
<p>The Importers and Exporters Association, in light of the recent sluggish sales and declining prices in overseas markets, with even fur prices having fallen by more than 50%, notes that the Central Bank requires all foreign exchange from consigned goods shipped overseas by exporters and entrusted for sale to be settled by May 24th. Otherwise, the Central Trust Bureau's overseas agents will be entrusted to sell the goods at any price, causing widespread anxiety. It is generally believed that exporters have made great sacrifices in the past to secure foreign exchange funds for the government. However, due to the current decline in overseas market prices, they are not allowed to ship goods back from overseas, and are further required to settle foreign exchange within a limited time. This situation not only fails to adhere to the government's principle of encouraging exports, but will also deter exporters from engaging in outward processing business in the future.</p>
<p>The association will submit a petition to the Central Bank today, listing the reasons and requesting that the bank understand the difficulties of businesses, withdraw its order, and extend the settlement period for foreign exchange, so that exporters can suffer fewer losses and align with the government's original intention of encouraging exports.</p>
<h3>Chairman Xu Letian of the Fuel Management Committee Discusses the Current Situation of Coal Mines in North and Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Xu Rongtian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, upon returning to Shanghai from Beijing, stated during an interview with reporters that the coal production in North and Northeast China has increased. However, due to railway damage and insufficient allocation of railcars, transportation capacity still needs to be strengthened. To ensure a continuous supply of coal to Central and South China, the government will focus on the development of Huainan and other new coalfields. After two to three months of preparation, everything in Huainan is on track, and the railway to Yuxikou will also be strengthened to facilitate coal transportation. Regarding the issue of raising coal prices and the requests for price increases from merchants in North China, he discussed the matter in Beijing with the heads of Kailuan, Huainan, East China, and the six Northeast mines, and consulted with Vice President Wang. The government is willing to make reasonable adjustments without hindering production. Due to the government's continued implementation of subsidy policies this month, no changes are planned. The Fuel Management Committee is drafting measures to be submitted to the Price Conference in June for a comprehensive solution. The protection of coal mines in various parts of China was also discussed in detail, and it was decided to increase the strength of the mine protection forces to ensure safety. In the past, the Communist army often used occupied coal mines to continue production and exchange coal for our materials. Recently, the policy has changed, and after occupying coal mines, they destroy the equipment thoroughly. For example, the Datong coal mine, which had been developed by the Japanese for several years and had reached the scale of Kailuan, has been devastated since the Communist army occupied it. Currently, it is only producing using indigenous methods, and the output is insignificant. The machinery of the Boshan coal mine was dismantled by the Chinese Communists and transported to Yantai, making future restoration work difficult. Such cases are numerous, so mine protection work is extremely important. In addition, shipping companies have also requested higher water transportation costs for coal, which is currently being negotiated by Li Jinglu, Director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, with the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Free Trading of Cooking Oil; Oil Market Opens Today</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, to stabilize the prices of essential food materials for the residents of this city, in addition to allowing the free buying and selling of rice, it is learned that he has now also specially permitted the free trading of cooking oil, abolishing the price control system. The Oil Merchants Association will open a cooking oil market, which is scheduled to officially open at 10:00 a.m. today (the 19th). Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council, Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, and others will attend to give instructions.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the supply of oil and grain to the city has been difficult recently, and the future is not optimistic. Because Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, and other places in the Northeast have strictly prohibited exports, it is reported that the oil and grain industry has drafted proposals requesting Mayor Wu to negotiate with the local governments of Yingkou and other places to ensure the smooth flow of goods.</p>
<h3>Automobile Business Association Established</h3>
<p>The Automobile Business Association of this city held its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. at the Atlantic Restaurant. More than 80 people attended, including representatives from various agencies and members. Chen Ke, the interim chairman, delivered the opening remarks, and Liu Jingsheng reported on the preparations. Next, representatives from the party and government and guests delivered speeches. Then, the articles of association were discussed, and the directors and supervisors were elected by ballot. Fifteen people, including Zhu Daxun and Zhou Mengxian, were elected as directors.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Dairy Factory Introduces New Unsalted Butter</h3>
<p>Shanghai Dairy Factory, established for many years, specializes in producing "An Jian Er" and "Golden Lion" brand full-fat milk powder and butter. Recently, it has added new-style machinery and continues to supply "An Jian Er" and "Golden Lion" brand milk powder, and has also launched fresh sterilized milk, which has reached thousands of households since its introduction. It has also newly released "An Jian Er" salted and unsalted butter in one-pound, half-pound, and quarter-pound packages. These surpass foreign products. Currently, they are widely sold in major foreign liquor, candy, and food stores.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Fertilizer By-products Planned to be Shipped to Shanghai for Supply to Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Taiwan Fertilizer produces fertilizer by-products. Regarding fertilizer, it produces 12,000 tons of gaseous fertilizer and 32,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer annually. Regarding by-products, it produces 100 to 200 tons of 66-degree sulfuric acid and 500 to 800 tons of 50-degree sulfuric acid monthly. In addition, it produces 300 to 500 tons of calcium carbide and 60 tons of electrodes (i.e., carbon electrodes) monthly. The carbon electrode products are divided into three sizes: 3-inch, 8-inch, and 12-inch. It also produces over 11 tons of saltpeter monthly. It is reported that the fertilizer products will be reserved for Taiwan's own use, while the by-products are planned to be sold to Shanghai. However, they are not intended to be sold as general commodities but are hoped to be supplied directly to various factories. The allocation method is said to be that the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office will convene various factories to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Incense Association Forms Joint Operation Office for Incense Sticks</h3>
<p>The Incense Stick Group of the Municipal Incense Association, in view of the fact that past operations have not been jointly coordinated, resulting in inconsistent order prices and uneven quality, and that raw material prices have increased and labor and food expenses have become increasingly large, has organized a joint operation office to improve quality and standardize prices. It will begin accepting orders from today.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Markets Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>This year's silkworm season in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is expected to be bountiful due to the warm weather in recent days. In particular, Zhejiang has started cultivating silk early. After discussion, it has been decided that all cocoon markets in each district of the province will open uniformly around the 20th of this month. The province is divided into sixteen groups, and the candidates for group leaders have been selected by the three district associations from the list of member manufacturers, which has been approved by the association. The group leaders have gone to prepare for the opening of the cocoon markets and the purchase of cocoons. It is estimated that the total amount of cocoons collected in the province will be about 120,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Calculated at 280 jin per dan of dried cocoons, this would yield more than 43,000 dan of dry cocoons. If calculated at 420 jin per dan, it would yield more than 10,000 dan of spring silk.</p>

<h3>Wei Daoming's Arrival in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 15th (Air Mail) Special Report by Our Reporter Yang Yu</p>
<p>The heavy responsibility of governing Taiwan Province, which was liberated after being occupied by the Japanese for more than fifty years, has been passed on today from Governor Chen Yi of the Governor-General's Office, which has existed for a year and a half, to Dr. Wei Daoming, the first chairman of the new provincial government. This is a major event since the restoration. The people of Taiwan are not overly surprised by the change of personnel, but everyone is worried about the intangible stagnation and disconnection in politics from the February 28th Incident until now, and anxious about the slow arrival of the successor. Many people say, "During the Japanese rule, it only took three days to replace a governor-general." After waiting and waiting, finally at 11:05 a.m. yesterday, tens of millions of eyes filled with hope saw Chairman Wei and his wife, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, step down from China Airlines XT-T68 at Songshan Airport outside Taipei. The Southern country is early hot, the sun like fire scorches the skin, the airport surged with excited and enthusiastic waves of people.</p>
<p>Airport Broadcast</p>
<p>Chairman Wei was wearing a dark suit and was energetic. Madam Wei took off her black glasses, accepted two bunches of bright flowers with a smile, and stood still while two or thirty cameras freely captured this memorable moment. Amidst the military music, between the steel helmets and bayonets of the honor guard, between the heads and flags of the long welcoming line, Chairman Wei moved to the microphone in front of the airport lounge. Speaker Huang of the Provincial Assembly delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the people of the province: "The Central Government has specially sent Chairman Wei, who is extremely accomplished in diplomacy, to preside over the administration of Taiwan, which shows that the Central Government attaches importance to Taiwan Province." These words were translated into Taiwanese, Hakka, and Japanese. Chairman Wei's answer was simple, and he conserved his energy. He said: "Taiwan was occupied by the Japanese for more than fifty years. After eight years of bloody war, it was newly returned to the embrace of the motherland. I am extremely excited to come here. In the future, I am willing to do my best to work with my compatriots to seek the happiness of Taiwan Province." These words were broadcast to every corner of the island. Everyone is praying for happiness, and they believe that after these voices are heard, the new chairman will surely bring new happiness to the people of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The student队伍排队从机场一直到宾馆,足足晒了两个小时的烈日,这时候望着28001号汽车,有的挥旗,有的欢呼,魏主席频频点头,魏夫人则在车内佝偻了体躯,向行列摆手.</p>
<p>Policy Direction</p>
<p>Chairman Wei said when he received reporters at the Taipei Guest House at 3 p.m. that day: "I am very willing to know the local public opinion and consensus." The fact that he rushed to meet with reporters for the first time less than three hours after getting off the plane is enough to make the reporters feel comforted, and it is also worthy of the reporters to be more vigilant in their future work. "Governing should respect the public will, but it must also follow the path of the rule of law. In the economic field, we will make the greatest efforts to seek stability, and then seek development and prosperity from stability. The promotion of a free economic policy is necessary, but in principle, it should not hinder economic stability." He further added: "The principles have been decided, but specific problems need to be studied in detail, individually, and then planned and resolved comprehensively, which seems more practical." At the same time, he also used these words to answer many questions raised by reporters, such as the method of economic assistance and the adjustment of the salaries of public and educational personnel. Chairman Wei affirmed this view: It is not easy to clarify a problem, and deciding on a measure based solely on simple thinking often leads to failure.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Consideration</p>
<p>What reporters are most concerned about is the adjustment of the previous public office structure. What is the possibility of changing the Transportation Department, the Industry and Mining Department, and the Police Department? What countermeasures will be taken for the Monopoly and Trade Bureaus? How will public enterprises be dealt with? As for the smaller issues of dance halls and prostitution, Chairman Wei often replied, "This is one of the issues I am considering." He stated that before the new structure has been adjusted, everything will remain as it is. He emphasized the word "consideration."</p>
<p>Speaking of the press itself, Chairman Wei said that the provincial government should set up a special agency to maintain regular contact with the press, and he himself hopes to maintain contact with reporters at all times. Regarding the Japanese version of newspapers in this province, Chairman Wei believes that it still has value in the transitional period, but the focus is still on the active promotion of Mandarin.</p>
<p>One reporter asked Chairman Wei, "Does Madam Wei intend to lead the women's movement in this province?" Chairman Wei was amused and said with a smile, "Then ask her herself!"</p>
<p>At four o'clock, Chairman Wei continued to receive representatives from all walks of life. He left after ending this press conference. Before leaving, he invited the reporters to have some refreshments. Chief of Staff Zhou Guangming of the Garrison Headquarters represented the host and chatted with us humorously.</p>
<p>A new page has now been opened, and the pace of building a new Taiwan will be further developed. The six million people will always be watching and hoping! (May 16)</p>
<p>Chairman Wei uses a written report to explain the political direction: "Orderly Democracy"</p>

<h3>With the Gun-Carrying Soldiers, Reliving the Old Gejiu Dreams: Ten Days in Southern Yunnan (1)</h3>
<p>— Kunming, 12th by Air Mail. Special Correspondent Xu Jilian of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the people of the Three Yi region are known for their diligence and hard work, as this characteristic is nurtured by the natural environment. Among them, the people of Southern Yunnan demonstrate even greater fortitude. In this vast area, many people live by relying on their strength and depending on the weather for their livelihoods. However, on the other hand, Southern Yunnan is a region where culture and talent converge, producing numerous scholars and forming the cultural center of Yunnan province.</p>
<p>The out-of-town reporters in Kunming had long planned a collective visit to Southern Yunnan. After various arrangements, our temporary group finally set off on the 26th of last month, as we had wished. The members included one representative from each of the nine daily evening newspapers in Kunming, as well as four reporters stationed in Kunming from major newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai. The journey was filled with laughter and conversation, so it wasn't lonely at all. The round trip took a total of ten days, with stops in Yiliang, Chenggong, Kaiyuan, Gejiu, and Mengzi counties. However, we spent a longer time in Gejiu because it is China's "Tin Capital," and we carefully toured the area.</p>
<p>A City in the Hot Circle: Kaiyuan</p>
<p>After a full day and a half of train and car travel, we arrived in Gejiu. The journey was quite arduous. The narrow-gauge tracks and small locomotives of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway struggled, especially when climbing slopes, and the climate in Southern Yunnan was far from as cool as in Kunming. We gradually approached the scorching heat. In the train car, we felt like we were in a steamer. Adding to this were countless large and small tunnels, and the passengers' suffocation was something only they could understand. Fortunately, the railway bureau was quite punctual with the train schedule. After a full eleven hours, we arrived in Kaiyuan, a major city in Southern Yunnan, at six o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The weather in Kaiyuan already felt like early summer in the Jiangnan region. A stone-paved street, quiet and lazy, stretched through the city center. The young apprentices in the shops, wearing sleeveless shirts, were attending to the few customers. Business was not very prosperous. The sound of wooden clogs "clattering" on the stone pavement echoed once or twice, heavy and clear, breaking through the deathly silence of Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>Under the awning of the Railway Hotel, I spoke with Liu Jingming, the secretary-general of the special party branch of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, about the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which everyone was concerned about. He raised his voice and said, "The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway must be repaired quickly. This is indeed the most urgent task at hand." He then explained the importance of Kaiyuan in the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and in foreign trade. Currently, the repair work on the Bisezhai to Hekou section is still being delayed. It would be a great thing if it could be completed before the rainy season next year. Although the Ministry of Transportation had already approved 9.3 billion yuan for the construction cost, the money has not yet been received, so it is all just "talking on paper." At present, only 1 billion yuan has been received as an advance payment. With such high prices and labor costs, what can be accomplished?</p>
<p>Difficulties Still Need to be Overcome in Repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway</p>
<p>In fact, there are too many difficulties in repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. First of all, the dispute over the rights between China and France has not yet been resolved. Our side believes that after the takeover, France has no right to interfere with the main line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, at least within the national borders. However, the French have repeatedly demanded joint management, which is difficult to accept in any way. Under the premise of so-called "equal sharing of benefits," if China's international status cannot be improved, France may be unlikely to relax their demands.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the unstable situation in Vietnam poses a major problem for the transportation of materials. Whether there is money to buy sleepers and steel rails, or whether they can be purchased, it is still impossible to solve the problem of how to transport them to this area for laying. Moreover, the rainy season brings another major obstacle. With so many difficulties, talking about repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway naturally makes people feel extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>I spent a night in a Kaiyuan hotel, filled with doubts. I thought that those in charge of road administration were helpless, so what conclusions could I, an outsider, reach? Early the next morning, we climbed onto a large truck, leaving the problems behind, and headed towards the interview center: Gejiu.</p>
<p>It is only 53 kilometers from Kaiyuan to Gejiu. If you take the "Ge-Bi-Shi Railway" train, it takes ten hours. Traveling by road only takes three hours by car. Compared to the two, it seems that the car is faster and more convenient. However, heaven! After starting, I have never encountered such a bad road surface in my travel experience. The road was covered with jagged gravel and overgrown with weeds. How could it be considered a highway?</p>
<p>The Tin Capital of Ours: Gejiu</p>
<p>With great difficulty, we were brought into the county seat of Gejiu in this bumpy manner. After arriving in a new place, the three hours of thrills and fatigue were long forgotten.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Tin Corporation arranged our accommodation, and their hospitality reduced some of the inconvenience for long-distance travelers. At the tea party, Associate Manager Lu received a report from the security team leader: a Cantonese mine worker, carrying two packs of cigarettes, was mistaken by bandits for carrying cash and was stabbed to death on the street with a knife. This news naturally sent chills down the spines of the unfamiliar travelers. Everyone was asking themselves: Is Gejiu such a terrifying city?</p>
<p>With doubt and fear intertwined in our minds, the Tin Corporation sent four gun-carrying soldiers as escorts in the evening, allowing us to have a tour of the entire city. I walked in front with the security team leader. The irregular stone road was paved into a long slope according to the height of the mountain. I allowed my footsteps to move in the chaotic stones and finally asked impatiently, "Where exactly is the city?"</p>
<p>Past Prosperity Turned to Lament: Gejiu is Sobbing</p>
<p>"Sir, we have been in the city all along!" the team leader reminded me. So I finally focused my eyes and looked around. The world-famous tin capital had fallen into such a state of dilapidation that it was hard to believe if you hadn't experienced it yourself. The shops on the side were tightly closed. The mountain surrounded the city, and the scene was desolate. I hated my useless pen for not being able to depict it before the readers' eyes.</p>
<p>Then, from the mouth of the security team leader, I learned about the rise and fall of Gejiu in these years. "Gejiu is truly a bankrupt," the speaker said with deep emotion. He fell into the depths of memory and began to relive the beautiful dreams of the prosperous period. He said that in the heyday of Gejiu, there were nearly 200,000 sand miners on the mines alone. There were also many "factory bosses" (i.e., mining capitalists). At that time, there were theaters and cinemas. Imported goods arrived in Gejiu first. How could Kunming people talk about fashion? The factory bosses exchanged tons of tin ore for cash, stuffed it into their pockets, and used the best Yunnan soil and gold-made smoking sets. Tell me, where could you find this kind of extravagance?</p>
<p>Speaking of eating, what were delicacies from the mountains and seas, bear paws, and bird's nests, considered in Gejiu at that time? Banquets were commonplace, with three to five hundred tables at a single invitation, which was not uncommon. The power of the factory bosses was unmatched. Unfortunately, good times don't last forever. Times have changed, and today, not to mention people, even the city is sobbing in secret. This place, which produces nothing but tin, is facing such a bleak situation today, a bit like a young master fallen on hard times.</p>
<p>Countless Municipal Affairs: Not Knowing Where to Start</p>
<p>The days of prosperity are long gone. Today, Gejiu is desolate. This city, which rose from mining, is calling out to new and old factory bosses, hoping that the golden age will reappear and return to the hustle and bustle of the past.</p>
<p>Gejiu suffered a total of eighteen bombings by enemy planes during the Anti-Japanese War. In the entire Yunnan province, the losses were quite considerable. Remnants of the bombings remain on the streets, left to decay. At a time when the tin industry is yet to be revitalized, who can be in the mood to pay attention to the restoration of municipal administration?</p>

<p>A Line of Defense in Guangdong</p>
<p>The Ma'an Polder Flood Control and Farmland Irrigation Project is a concrete expression of the struggle against the forces of nature with great human power. Ma'an Polder is located in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, at the confluence of the East River and its tributary, the Si River. The land there is fertile, and the prices are abundant. The entire area is a plain of about 170 square miles, with 200,000 acres of farmland. However, due to the lack of water conservancy in the past, the farmland suffered losses. Every year, when the rainy season comes, floods inundate the fields, causing severe damage. During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, local villagers built a 21-kilometer-long embankment along the East River. After it was breached once, it was repaired and destroyed repeatedly, losing its flood control effect. Moreover, the Si River, a tributary of the East River, was not taken into account. When the East River rose, it flowed back into the Si River, flooding the fields on both banks, which could not be prevented. Twenty years ago, the embankment was breached by two kilometers, and the floodwaters carried sand into the fields, covering more than 5,000 acres, which remain barren to this day. According to local elders, no one wanted an acre of land even for two yuan at that time, making the fertile 200,000 acres of farmland in the entire area almost turn into wasteland. This is a very regrettable thing! Therefore, local enlightened people believe that the construction of this water conservancy project is essential to ensure the stability and livelihood of the villagers. This can be said to be the motivation for the construction of Ma'an Polder; however, the completion of a great project is not a matter of one day or one night. In addition to time, financial resources, and manpower, it also requires perseverance and determination to achieve today's success.</p>
<p>Construction Process Takes Four Years</p>
<p>The construction of Ma'an Polder, from surveying, design, and several planning stages to completion, took more than four years. During this period, the local gentry who mobilized the project traveled and appealed, resolved difficulties, and endured hardships. There were also heroic sacrifices. Now, General Qiu Zhaochen, chairman of the Polder Council, is the most diligent promoter of this project. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was the commander of the Changsha Garrison in Hunan and also a gentleman from Huiyang County. Because the supply of foreign rice was cut off during the war, there was a widespread famine in Guangdong Province, and the crisis was even more severe in the counties along the East River. Local gentry such as General Qiu Zhaochen felt that the lack of water conservancy in the area affected the people's food supply. Therefore, in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), they initiated the proposal to build Ma'an Polder. At that time, Mr. Liu Binggang, the magistrate of Huiyang County, strongly advocated the project. Unexpectedly, Huiyang was soon invaded by the enemy, and Magistrate Liu was captured and died after refusing to surrender because he ran around to promote the construction of Ma'an Polder water conservancy. He was later commended by the National Government, so he can be said to have sacrificed for Ma'an Polder. Later, Huiyang was lost and regained three times. General Qiu and others continued to work tirelessly on this project. In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), they submitted a request to the provincial government to send a team to survey the area. The entire design work was completed in August of the following year. Just as they were about to start construction, Huiyang fell for the fourth time, and the construction work had to be suspended.</p>
<p>600,000 People Settled and Able to Make a Living</p>
<p>After the victory, General Luo Zhuoying returned to take charge of Guangdong's administration and set the goal of prioritizing people's livelihood in the construction of the province. Therefore, farmland water conservancy construction became a major project. The construction of the Ma'an Polder water conservancy project was brought up again. Initially, it was intended to use Japanese prisoners of war to save construction costs, but soon all Japanese prisoners of war were transported back to their country, and it was difficult to raise such a large sum of money, so it could not be realized. In June of last year, Xie Wenlong took over as the head of the Construction Department and also sought to implement this project quickly. At that time, Wu Zhimei, Lin Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Hu Mulan, Xiao Ciyao, Yi Qun and others organized the Guangdong Food Relief Association. Because the food shortage in Guangdong Province was serious and needed to be increased to provide relief, both the symptoms and the root causes were addressed. They allocated 140 million yuan in relief funds to advocate this project. Later, they obtained a loan of 860 million yuan from the Agricultural Bank, an advance payment of 90 million yuan from the Water Conservancy Commission, and 1,200 tons of relief grain from the Guangdong Good Rescue Branch. The local Polder Council also raised 300 million yuan in construction funds. Thus, this great project was laid the foundation on December 5 last year and was fully completed in early May of this year, taking a total of 15 months and costing more than 2.8 billion yuan. It mobilized 900,000 local laborers. Under the joint cooperation of the government and the people, this line of defense to protect people's livelihood was completed. From then on, the 200,000 acres of farmland would no longer be threatened by the floods of the East River, and the 600,000 villagers in the county would be able to settle down and make a living. This is not only the greatest achievement of Guangdong Province's reconstruction after the war, but also, according to the records of the Water Conservancy Commission, the largest farmland water conservancy project in China after the victory.</p>
<p>Great Embankment, Sixty Li Long</p>
<p>On May 11, Chairman Luo personally presided over the completion ceremony of the Ma'an Polder flood control project. The reporter followed to participate in the grand event and was able to see the entire picture of this great project: it is a long embankment, winding and flat, resembling the Great Wall; it is 60 Chinese li long, and the entire project involves 1.1 million cubic meters of earthwork. It can be divided into two sections: one starts from Ma'an Mountain, runs along the inner side of the Hui-Ping Highway, crosses Longpan, passes through Lin Village, Dahu Creek, and reaches Beng Mountain, then crosses Linjiang Drain and turns northeast to the bank of the East River, ending at Tanwu Mountain, with a length of 7,880 meters. The height of the embankment base is one meter higher than the flood level, the top width is two meters, and the inner and outer slopes are one to two. Among the various creeks and drains, Dahu Creek is the largest. The other section is the old embankment, which starts from Tanwu Mountain, runs along the bank of the East River, goes straight upstream, passes through Wannian Village, Shuikou Market, Pengying Village, and reaches Sanshan, with a length of 22.6 kilometers. It is the area through which the source of Dahu Creek flows and the only stream in the area that flows in from outside the area, originating about two kilometers from Heshanmen. There are a total of seven sluice gates along the embankment, all named in memory of the merits of the officials who planned and supervised the project and the assistance of various agencies. The largest of these is the Dahu Creek sluice gate, named "Ciwei Sluice" in memory of Chairman Luo's achievements. The others are "Ruifu Sluice," "Zhongnongwen Sluice," "Liangjiu Sluice," "Shanjiiu Sluice," "Wenlong Sluice," and "Qunxian Sluice." Except for the Qunxian Sluice at Heshanmen, which uses a vertical board type, the others are all roll-up types.</p>
<p>200,000 Acres of Fields Benefit</p>
<p>The engineer in charge of this project is Li Zefu, who has extensive experience in farmland water conservancy projects. He has been working on this project since 1942. According to his estimation, the value of this project is not only that it can protect 200,000 acres of farmland from floods, but it can also rely on the sluice gates to control the water volume, to accumulate the water in the lakes, ponds, creeks, and drains in the area and use it for irrigation. Therefore, the expected benefits of this project are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Direct benefits of flood prevention - 150,000 mu of existing arable land can increase rice production by 300,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 30,000 dan per year.</p>
<p>(2) Benefits of irrigation by using sluice gates to store the water volume of lakes and streams - Most of the above-mentioned 150,000 mu are interspersed with lakes, ponds, streams, and drains, and rice production can be increased by 50,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 20,000 dan per year.</p>
<p>(3) Benefits of reclaiming wasteland by virtue of flood prevention - Reclaim more than 20,000 mu of large grassland in Mumachang and more than 20,000 mu of wasteland in other places. In the first year, rice production can be increased by about 100,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 20,000 dan.</p>
<p>The total annual increase in rice production is 450,000 dan and miscellaneous grains 70,000 dan. This number is enough to bear a quarter of the total food shortage in the province. In today's severe food problem, this number has a lot of help for the allocation of food in the province!</p>
<p>Reclamation and Increased Production Still Need Effort</p>
<p>Indeed, this huge project has been completed, but there are still many problems in the future. As Chairman Luo said, "This is just the beginning of the work. This project is like a city wall, but we must maintain it well so that we will not allow the flood enemies to break through again; and how to make the farmland in the area benefit and produce a lot still depends on everyone's efforts." Indeed, the garden has been repaired, but this is only a passive way to prevent floods. To truly produce a lot, there must be a concrete plan and a large amount of manpower. At the same time, we cannot ignore the future distribution of land rights and interests, because the land price in the area will certainly rise with the completion of the project. Land disputes will be difficult to avoid in the future, so this depends more on the local government and enlightened gentry to deal with it fairly with a long-term vision, considering the majority of the people. All rights and obligations should be stipulated clearly, and they should be led to actively reclaim and increase production, so that this project can have real value, and the people can get permanent benefits after thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Liu'an, Anhui</h3>
<p>— Hefei, 8th Express News. Reporter Bao Baiping of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Shielding the southeast, with land and water routes open, this state is different from other states.</p>
<p>Mountains surround Yinghuo with a thousand layers of beauty, the land controls the Jianghuai with four hundred heroes.</p>
<p>— Wang Hong's poem about Liu'an Prefecture</p>
<p>When the spring rain half-soaked the reporter's clothes, the open car of the Anhui Highway Bureau finally completed the 101-kilometer journey, bringing the reporter from Hefei to Liu'an, an important town in western Anhui.</p>
<p>Liu'an is located on the eastern bank of the upper reaches of the Pai River, a tributary of the Huai River. From the central Anhui plain, it is already a small hilly area.</p>
<p>Ye Shi of the Song Dynasty wrote in "New School Records of Liu'an County": "Liu'an is the ancient state of Gaotao. More than four hundred years after its demise, Ying Bu (according to the Liu'an Prefecture Chronicle, Ying Bu was from Liu'an) helped Xiang Yu destroy it and then helped Han betray Chu, reigning over its land again." Now, 20 li east of Liu'an, next to the Liuhe Highway, there are the Gaotao Shrine and the Gaotao Tomb, and there is the Ying Bu Tomb in the city, but the wild grass and weeds have made it impossible to find the relics. This is just a legend, and the old people of Liu'an dare not determine its truth to the reporter.</p>
<p>Since the Ming Dynasty, Liu'an has been famous for its tea. "Huiliu Famous Tea," tea merchants have always used it as a sign to attract customers, and the name of Liu'an has also become particularly well-known because of this.</p>
<p>Abundant Products, Poor People</p>
<p>In 1931, a part of western Liu'an was划歸to the newly established Lihuang County. The county now has an area of 3,793 square kilometers, scattered with 700,000 people. In Anhui, compared to other counties, it ranks third in area and sixth in population. Located between mountains and plains, the highest temperature is 29.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest is 6.5 degrees Celsius, the average temperature throughout the year is 18 degrees Celsius, and the total rainfall is 904.9 mm. Under the excellent natural environmental conditions of the county's vast area, suitable temperature, and rainfall, it constitutes a wealthy county in Anhui. In the eyes of people engaged in county administration work, it is often considered an ideal place.</p>
<p>Among the 52 townships in Liu'an, strictly speaking, there are plains, hills, and mountains. Therefore, there are many kinds of products, the most famous being tea, hemp, bamboo, wood, rice, and wheat. According to not very accurate statistics, the annual tea production at its peak was more than 34,000 dan, and at its lowest was also more than 13,000 dan. The hemp production at harvest was 79,000 dan. The southwestern mountainous area is full of bamboo and wood, and the supply of rice and wheat for consumption in the county is more than sufficient. If you compare it with the small and poor counties, Liu'an can be said to be blessed by nature.</p>
<p>However, although Liu'an is rich in products, it is not self-sufficient today. The local products that the farmers have worked hard to harvest are transferred to the hands of merchants at the lowest cost and transported to other places to weave. The farmers are just holding on to a little surplus product to get through the years of hardship. They do not get the slightest enjoyment in life because of the wealth on their own land and are always groaning under the oppression of usury. Just more than 30 li away from Liu'an, the car that the reporter was riding in broke down, and I had the opportunity to see a resident's thatched shed by the roadside that didn't even have a door. You can imagine how bad their life is!</p>
<p>Copper Head, Iron Mouth, Tofu Accent</p>
<p>The reporter stepped into the streets of Liu'an, and the first impression was cleanliness and tranquility. The city wall was ordered to be demolished during the Anti-Japanese War, supposedly to facilitate guerrilla warfare if the Japanese army invaded. Liu'an was occupied for four months starting in July 1938. After the enemy withdrew, it has been free ever since. Because it is close to the occupied area of Hefei, it once had a great prosperity from 1939 to the time of victory. At that time, tea and hemp were smuggled out, and cloth and salt were smuggled in, so Liu'an took the "Anti-Japanese fortune," and it was very prosperous for a time. Today, there are many hotels and restaurants in Liu'an, which can be said to be the relics of the prosperity at that time, but now, all industries are depressed, and there is no bustling scene to be seen.</p>
<p>Liu'an has the saying "copper head, iron mouth, tofu accent," which describes the habits of the people of Liu'an. In Liu'an, whether it is cold or hot, few people wear hats when going out, which is called "copper head." Except for the hottest weather, people always put vegetables in a hot pot to eat throughout the year, which is called "iron mouth." Friends come and go, whether discussing matters or chatting, they like to lie on the bed or on the sleeping chair, which is called "tofu accent." When the reporter went to a restaurant in Liu'an for the first time, the waiter first served a hot pot, which contained braised fish that had already been cooked. At first, I was quite surprised. It was already late spring, so why still use a hot pot? Later, I learned that this was the local custom. However, the braised fish in the hot pot was very delicious while cooking and eating. Although it was the first time to try this way of eating, I was very satisfied. Compared to the mutton tripe hot pot in Chongqing in winter, it is even better.</p>
<h3>Dr. Li Peien Talks About Student Unrest</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 12th Express News. Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Students of National Yingshi University, for the sake of the issue of school buildings and the president, petitioned the Ministry of Education, and, undeterred by hardship, travelled from Jinhua by train to Hangzhou, wanting to follow the Hangzhou-Shanghai and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways to Nanjing to appeal to the Ministry of Education. Here, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road was once interrupted, and disputes arose repeatedly. At this time, the reporter was on his way back to Hangzhou from Shanghai and was blocked in Jiaxing. After returning to Hangzhou, I visited Dr. Li Peien, president of Zhijiang University, and after a long discussion, we both agreed that the domestic academic atmosphere today is gradually declining. We have only seen people donating scholarships and building school buildings, but we have not seen anyone donating professors or donating instruments and books. The reason is probably that donating scholarships and building school buildings can get fame, while donating instruments and books and donating professors is nothing remarkable. But professors and equipment are the source of students' knowledge. The problem at Yingshi University this time is probably due to the lack of good professors and good equipment!</p>

<p>Regarding the reader's letter "Muddy Luofu Road Awaits Repair" published in this column on March 11th, we have now received a letter from the Shanghai Public Works Bureau stating that the drains on that road were dredged on April 28th. This is specially published for your information.</p>

<p>Reply to the Returning Soldiers from Australia. Regarding your letter appealing for funds to return home, we have received a reply from the General Headquarters of the Joint Logistics Command stating: "Upon investigation, when the 303 soldiers of this group arrived in Shanghai on January 8th via Labul transport, this Headquarters, to show its appreciation for their loyalty, immediately ordered the First Supply Region Command and the Shanghai Garrison Command, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government and other organizations, to launch a慰勞慰劳 (consolation) campaign, hold a welcome meeting, prepare food and lodging, issue bonuses, and pay them three months' salary based on their original rank, as well as provide generous travel expenses and transportation to send most of the soldiers back to their hometowns. However, more than 20 people among them returned to Shanghai on their own halfway and worked as porters or laborers at the docks. Those who have failed to find work or have been squeezed out by labor unions are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Under the current circumstances of financial hardship and meager treatment of the National Army (currently, the monthly salary of a combat soldier is only over 20,000 yuan), giving each of these soldiers tens of thousands or even two hundred thousand yuan at once was originally intended to express our sympathy for these soldiers who were captured during the war of resistance and stranded overseas, and urgently needed to be sent back to their hometowns. As for those who turned back halfway and voluntarily stayed in Shanghai, there is no way to arrange for their settlement. Upon receiving your letter, we have ordered the Shanghai Port Command to send personnel to properly persuade them to return home quickly, and will still provide transportation to send them away. This is a special reply for your information." Please be aware.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Feng Tianmo: Regarding your letter pointing out that the ticket sellers at Jiaxing Station lacked courtesy, we have received a reply from the Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration stating: "Upon investigation by the head of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Transportation Section, it was stated that the incident was due to passengers being unaware of the seat allocation for reserved train tickets, leading to a misunderstanding. On February 20th of this year, twelve passengers, holding official letters and travel permits, wanted to purchase twelve second-class tickets for the Jinling train to the North Station. At that time, the train was about to arrive at the station, and there were only seven second-class tickets left on the Jinling train. The ticket seller immediately explained the situation, stating that the remaining five tickets could only be changed to first class. However, the passengers did not understand the situation and thought it was a deliberate obstruction, leading to a dispute. The stationmaster then intervened to resolve the situation, and the passengers boarded the train. The ticket seller at the station did not show any discourtesy. After verification, the statement is factual. This is a special reply for your information."</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The Maid</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiahua</p>
<p>She was a typical country woman. From her actions, her clothing, and her appearance, one could immediately tell that she was rustic.</p>
<p>Mother Wang introduced her, saying that she had three advantages: first, she was from the same hometown; second, she was honest; third, she had a particularly docile personality. However, after several days, I only discovered her honesty. Isn't so-called honesty just another name for stupidity!</p>
<p>For example, if the child cried, unless you told her to comfort him, she would continue to patiently mend the two worn-out sock bottoms, showing that she was very "capable." And when guests came, it was only after being repeatedly urged that she would pour tea. If you asked her to prepare a little snack, she would ask this and that, making it more troublesome than doing it yourself.</p>
<p>Her face also had a "blemish." My wife said that her husband was "pinned down" by her appearance. Because the muscles in her face were particularly developed, and sharp-looking, giving the impression of a nail. Because of this, the most mischievous of the three younger brothers nicknamed her "Nail." When she was called "Nail," she would stagger over. "What!" Her voice was low.</p>
<p>So everyone called her "Nail." "Nail," "Nail," and she would bustle around.</p>
<p>Not only was she foolish, but her eyes also seemed particularly dull. She had hardly ever done anything well enough to be praised. For example, if I wanted to change my clothes, she would always bring my wife's as well.</p>
<p>"You—these are Madam's!"</p>
<p>Sometimes I couldn't help but scold her, but she would still do the same. Even when she went to the market in the morning to buy some groceries, she would often mix up the oil bottle and the soy sauce bottle. It wasn't a big deal if cooking oil was put in the soy sauce bottle, but it was terrible when soy sauce was put in the cooking oil bottle. Even though my wife repeatedly instructed her, and even tied yellow and black threads around the bottle openings as markers, she still couldn't tell them apart.</p>
<p>It was even more troublesome when someone came to visit and we weren't home. She could only understand the dialect of Yuyao, her hometown. If someone from Shaoxing visited us, that was still alright; but if they weren't from Shaoxing, it would take at least half a day to get through to her.</p>
<p>One day, Jing from Beiping came to visit my wife. Jing asked, "Is Madam home?" but was turned away. Jing came again a second time, and was turned away again. On the third visit, it happened that my wife was standing at the door, and they finally met. The reason was that "Nail" only knew that there was a "Sir" and a "Madam" in the house, and didn't know of a "Mrs."</p>
<p>So my wife often complained, gritting her teeth and cursing:</p>
<p>"Really a nail, ruining everything."</p>
<p>Because she often did things that were very disappointing, one day, I talked to her for two hours. Although we were from the same hometown, I had been wandering away from home for many years, and my hometown accent was fading, so our conversation was very difficult.</p>
<p>Not only could Nail not understand what I was saying, but she also couldn't speak well. Besides "Yes, sir" and "I understand," she hardly made any other sounds. Originally, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to her and correct her shortcomings, and tell her some common etiquette. But the result was truly both funny and exasperating.</p>
<p>My wife often clamored for me to change her, because she said, "This kind of person only adds to the trouble." But I could only tactfully persuade my wife to be patient, and do the necessary things ourselves.</p>
<p>The reason I persuaded my wife to be patient was that I found "Nail's" honesty particularly endearing. Although she wasn't as clever as the previous Zhang sister-in-law, she also wouldn't play tricks like Zhang sister-in-law. When Zhang sister-in-law went to the market, she would never return the small change from five or ten thousand yuan. "Padding the bill" was simply never an issue. She, on the contrary, might buy slightly inferior vegetables or not cook them well enough. But every day when she returned from the market, she would "report the accounts" to my wife. If she had more than a yuan, she would return it; if she was short a yuan, she would ask for it back. If she couldn't remember, she would get anxious and shout, "Madam, let me report it again." Even if my wife said, "Forget it, forget it," she wouldn't let it go. "Meat, five thousand," she would hold up her thumb; "Fish, one thousand five," she would hold up her index finger. She would do this until all five of her bent fingers were completely straightened, because we had limited the purchase to five kinds of vegetables each day.</p>
<p>After fully understanding her personality, my wife stopped scolding her. More important things were often done by my wife herself. So "Nail's" work changed from external duties to just teasing the newborn baby Mao'er, and looking after the house and doing laundry.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, little master, don't cry, Mama is going to the market," when Mao'er cried, she would mutter in a heavy nasal tone, gently patting him.</p>
<p>Now, when someone came to visit us, she would also chime in with a word or two, or say, "Please leave a message!"</p>
<p>After a year, we regarded her as one of our own, and she got along well with the maids in the neighboring houses. Because of her honesty and frugality, my wife was also very happy. She often said, "Nail has been trained by us." And sometimes, she would talk to me a few words: "Sir," "Madam." Her pronunciation was already very clear, not as heavy and slurred as when she first came.</p>
<p>One day, she sobbed softly to my wife, saying that she wanted to go home. This sudden event caught my wife off guard. Having a degree of trust in her, my wife naturally tried to persuade her to stay, and asked her the reason for her resignation.</p>
<p>But she didn't say anything, and tears streamed from her eyes. When I returned from the newspaper office in the evening, her eyes were completely red and swollen.</p>
<p>"Madam, I'll come back after February," no amount of persuasion was useful. She finally left, leaving only this sentence.</p>
<p>On the third day after she left, I saw her in front of the door of a midwife. I was surprised that she hadn't gone home. She was carrying a blue cloth bundle in her hand. Behind her was a doorman from my neighbor Zhang's residence, called Old Jiang. When she saw me, she seemed very shy.</p>
<p>The next day, Old Jiang came to me in a fluster, wanting me to help a little, saying that "Nail" had died and he was preparing to buy a coffin.</p>
<p>My wife was frantic, asking him repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Miscarriage," Old Jiang stammered:</p>
<p>"Miscarriage?" my wife exclaimed, grabbing her head, looking incredulous.</p>
<p>Looking at Old Jiang's embarrassed expression, and thinking back to the scene of him and "Nail" walking into the midwife's house four or five days ago, I already knew the outline of this unfortunate story.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the next day, I saw a news item in my own newspaper, saying that a maid in a certain residence had died tragically due to an "abortion," and that the midwife and the related person Jiang Ayun had been arrested, and so on.</p>
<h3>Grapes and Swimming Fish</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<h3>Cui Garden — Seventeenth of Yangzhou Dream</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>A place where one played in childhood is always missed in middle age, when one is hurt by sorrow and joy. Occasionally returning to one's hometown and passing through that place, seeing that the scenery is completely different, it is easier to feel the vicissitudes of life. In the past, beside the collapsed city wall of Yangzhou's old city, there was originally a vast expanse of desolate smoke and weeds. At the end of the previous Qing Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Xuantong, someone built houses there and established the Datong Theater. For a time, the drums and gongs were loud and bustling, and ladies and gentlemen mingled. But it was short-lived. It soon met with the restoration. Then, the theater closed. The houses were eroded by wind and rain. Over time, they became dilapidated. Several years later, some people pooled funds to buy the land, enclose it with low walls, plant many trees, and build a small stage with artificial hills, calling it Cui Garden. At that time, the Lingnan Guild Hall in the Cangxiang Alley of the new city was nearby. There was a place for salt merchants to rest called Small Garden. In this Small Garden, people gathered for banquets every day. During the banquets, they would sing and select beauties, surrounded by jewels and greens, truly a place to lose one's soul. The establishment of Cui Garden seemed to have been greatly influenced by the Small Garden. However, the Small Garden remained a club for salt merchants until it closed, while Cui Garden was once open for selling tea. The pastries they sold were best with box cakes. Because the place was quite large, with few houses, and because the flowers and trees were sparse, it gave people a sense of being in the mountains and forests within the city. Near Cui Garden was a plank bridge leading to Willow Lane. This bridge was then named Cui Garden Bridge. However, the teahouse business in Yangzhou's old city never really flourished, so Cui Garden's tea sales soon followed in the footsteps of the theater and closed down.</p>
<p>After Cui Garden closed, it was once rented to Gao Zhou, a Japanese supervisor sent by the Yangzhou Salt Affairs Inspectorate. Because Gao Zhou found it inconvenient to travel back and forth to Xiaoban Bridge by carriage, the bridge was changed to a brick bridge. When the Inspectorate built a new house and Gao Zhou left Yangzhou, Cui Garden became a very deserted place again. Before Cui Garden existed, I used to fly kites there with my little friends. After Cui Garden opened as a teahouse, I also went with my parents to drink tea. When Gao Zhou resided there, although the lights were on, the doors were always closed. Occasionally passing through that place, one could only look at the swaying trees and scattered pavilions inside through the short wall.</p>
<p>Who knew that Cui Garden would change owners again during the period of the Japanese occupation? For a time, construction was in full swing, and Cui Garden was rebuilt to be extremely luxurious, becoming a private garden. Because the new owner was Xiong Yubeng, Cui Garden was renamed Heng Garden, and even Cui Garden Bridge had someone inscribe the name on the bridge, changing it to Heng Garden Bridge. After the victory, Heng Garden was repeatedly borrowed by military organizations. It is said that it was going to be changed to the County Council, so Heng Garden would become a historical term. As for Heng Garden Bridge, it has recently been restored to its original name, Cui Garden Bridge, but Cui Garden is gone. All the scenery of Cui Garden is just leaving a memory for a group of middle-aged people.</p>
<p>It is said that when Cui Garden was changed to Heng Garden, there were two extremely precious peonies in the garden, one red and one white. Each time they bloomed, they had hundreds of flowers and trunks as thick as bowls. They were hundreds of years old. They were originally planted in the Flower Kingdom of a certain Chen in Dongguan, and were later moved here by Xiong. After Xiong left Yangzhou, the whereabouts of these two enormous peonies were unknown. Whether they flourished, withered, survived, or died, no one could find out. Perhaps they encountered the same destruction as Cui Garden.</p>
<h3>Seasons</h3>
<p>— Li Bai</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The seasons are about to make people old</p>
<p>Among the trivial mountains and fine grass</p>
<p>Autumn sounds like an old traveler pacing into the country</p>
<p>I remember that the small garden is full of sunset</p>
<p>Magpies are noisy on the birch trees all day long</p>
<p>At this moment, the building is empty and people are gone</p>
<p>Where is the old lotus fragrance left</p>
<p>Is the summer shirt of June already worn out</p>
<p>I only miss the past years</p>
<p>You come and go</p>
<p>Hasty travelers in the mountains</p>
<p>What year and month will you come back to stop at this small garden</p>
<p>Let white hair adorn the sparse stars</p>
<p>You are like ethereal white clouds in the sky</p>
<p>Never have the joy of revisiting the old place</p>
<p>Although this place has the beauty of lakes and mountains</p>
<p>There is nowhere to stop for you</p>
<p>In the eighth month of Xiaoxiang, you will come again with the mountain rain.</p>
<p>(1939, Hunan)</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Guan Xiu's "White Orchid" from the "Grass Poetry Medicine After Whistling" collection, such as the poem about willow catkins: "Embracing lightness, it is suitable everywhere, drifting with the wind and falling into the clear stream. The setting sun shines on the fisherman's blurred gaze, surpassing the plum blossoms of Yuling," the poem is quite exquisite, but it does not escape the air of rouge and powder, weaving flattery.</p>
<p>"Middle age has countless sorrows and joys, unbearable to see the golden hairpin in dreams. Long knowing that becoming a lowly daughter was my mistake, I only feel that giving birth to a son is as difficult as giving birth to you; I am saddened tonight to meet in vain, pondering the past events that want to break the liver, even if I momentarily recognize the illusion of floating foam, I am lonely and happy with a solitary pillow and a dim lamp." This is Qian Qianyi's lament for his deceased daughter A Qing. Poetry should originate from emotion, and Qian's poem especially comes from deep affection.</p>
<p>Weng Tonghe, a scholar of the Grand Secretariat, was purely a scholar through poetry. From commentaries on the Confucian classics to textual research in history and biographies, and the combing of inscriptions on metal and stone, all are permeated in his poems. Hong Liangji lamented Weng's poetry, saying: "Most happy to hear him talk about examples of metal and stone, slightly disliking that the public has little spiritual poetry," which is also a sound argument. I once saw his "Shizhou Poetry Talks," a collection of eight volumes, which were the notes taken when the scholar discussed poetry with his colleagues when he was inspecting education in Guangdong. Shi Yushan said that his purpose in discussing poetry is like a builder who lays out the tiles, bricks, wood, and stones, and builds up from the ground, which is very different from the magnificent Hua Yan towers.</p>
<p>Dai Liang, also known as Shushu of Pujiang, lived during the late Yuan dynasty, with unusual integrity and firmness. Even when he was rugged and blocked, he did not slightly frustrate his ambition. He was truly a loyal and righteous person. His poems were vast and cool, with passionate voices, mostly with the sound of the Zheng scale. For example, in the first verse of "Yingqiu": "Empty moats and abandoned ramparts surround Yingqiu, a desolate sight makes me sad. Bestowing shoes and conferring marquises remain for thousands of years, entrusting the cause to rest here at this time; crows crow in the ancient trees in the west, geese fall on the plains in the autumn of the North Sea. Looking back at the more than ten thousand miles of Jiangnan, who am I leaving this foreign land for?"</p>
<p>Poetry is indeed sick with clichés, but the ability to push the old and bring forth the new does not lead to inferiority. Such as in the fifth and sixth couplet in one verse of the casual meeting of a hermit of Jiuling Mountain. The sentences say: "Hundred years of world affairs are like vinegar flies, one night's homesickness makes the leopard weep." According to 醯雞 is 蠛蠓, a tiny insect. Zhuangzi: "Qiu's relationship to the Way is like a vinegar fly?" Xie leopard is Du Yu, a bird name. Qin Jing says: "Du Yu cries bitterly, then hangs himself on a tree, calling himself 'to leopard'."</p>
<p>Zhang Shunmin of the Song dynasty used the tune "Relying on the Voice of Selling Flowers" to write about Yueyang Tower: "Mu Hua descends from Junshan, the empty water is full of paintings, carefully gathering beautiful faces. Not for the departing guests of the west of the city, stop singing Yangguan, drunk sleeves caress the dangerous waves, the sky is light and the clouds are idle, who can get to revisit this road? Looking back at the setting sun in the red canopy, it should be Chang'an." The writing is bold and healthy, close to that of Old Slope. Later generations especially love to recite the second sentence of the fourth verse, but they do not know that these two sentences come from Bai Letian's poem "Yueyang Tower": "When the spring bank is green, the dream Ze is transported, and when the evening waves are red, it is near Chang'an." The Wenxian Tongkao records that Shunmin had a "Painting Field Collection" of one hundred volumes and memorial of ten volumes, but since the Ming dynasty, they have been scattered and lost. Only the eight volumes collected and printed from the Yongle Encyclopedia are preserved today.</p>
<p>Zhang Lei's lament over his son's death says: "Is it that the doctor could not find the right prescription? Or is it that his life had a short length? Is it only you who can make me so sad? Or do all fathers love their sons? The skull is flat and the forehead is smooth, the eyebrows are beautiful and the eyes are clear, now that he exists or is dead, is he still a ghost? If there is nothing, then what do I still think about? If he still has knowledge, then who will look after him in the desolate house and wild temple, in the wind, frost, rain, and dew?" This is a folk song with true feelings revealed, which cannot be faked, unlike chanting about the wind and playing with the moon, which can be dressed up and made up.</p>
<p>Wei Chengxiao's poem says: "Today's world is full of people with 褦襶子, touching the heat and going to people's houses." The dictionary says 褦２, pronounced nai dai, originally refers to the cool hat worn in summer months, with a green painting to decorate its eaves to block the sun. Now people who do not know what they are doing are called 褦襶. Recently, while reading Zhang Lei's poems, I also found the sentence "often being disturbed by 褦襶惊午梦," which I think is taken from Cheng's poem. Li Bai's "Sending Wangwu Mountain People Back to the Mountain" says: "In May, create my words, knowing that I am not a suitable person." Weng Fanggang said that the sound and meaning of 佁儗 are similar to 褦襶, and Li Bai also used Cheng's poem. In fact, the poem by Li Gongfeng used Sima Xiangru's "Ode to the Great Man": "沛艾赳螑，仡以佁儗." 怡 is read as Chi, and 儗 is read as Ni. The phrase "touching the heat" was later used in Guan Hanqing's "Xie Tianxiang Zaju," in the first fold there is a cloud: "I went to this touch is also like an official's line to make etiquette."</p>
<p>Kui Lv Sui records Yang Wanli's words, saying that Fei Xian's poems are natural, which is indeed a definite theory. Fei Xian was a man of the Southern Song Dynasty, so he was called Zhang Lei. He wrote "Kuo Shan Collection" in fifty volumes, with poems accounting for more than half. In the regulated verses, such as the couplet "Autumn Excitement": "Good trees have carved this year's leaves, the west wind is still last year's autumn"; "He Liulangzhong Shuzhou Qian'an": "Wild cranes avoid people's nests in ancient trees, Qing apes ride the moon and howl in the cold"; "Summer Day" says: "Butterfly clothes bask in powdered flowers at noon, spider webs add silk to the corners of the house on a clear day"; "He Zhou Kangyan" says: "The new moon has grown outside the flying birds, and the setting sun is more in the west of the sunset." The style of the poems is fresh and natural, and those who are not good at observing things cannot produce this.</p>
<h3>Between Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>When my illness became critical, my third brother sent a car and Ya Meng to take me to the hospital. Although my mind was often disturbed by pain at that time, my mood was unexpectedly clear, but my limbs were already weak and powerless. I wanted to do something or say something, but my heart was willing but my strength was not enough.</p>
<p>If I had gone to see a doctor five or six days earlier, not only could the surgery have been performed at any time, but the pain could also have been reduced, and it would not have been so dangerous. This was entirely due to my own procrastination. At first, I didn't expect it to be appendicitis, and I wanted to have it checked, but I didn't have any money.</p>
<p>Lying on the hospital bed, I didn't sleep all night. The diligent nurses would come to check my temperature every now and then, and change the ice pack every moment. I opened my eyes and looked at the sorrow on their faces. They were whispering, and I seemed to hear some unfavorable words. I knew that a small sign saying "No Food Allowed" had been hung on my bed rail. Terrifying doubts kept echoing in me. I had a premonition of my end, and my mind collapsed instantly!</p>
<p>I regretted that I didn't ask a friend to write a will for me when I could still speak a few days ago. Isn't such a death equivalent to a kind of pitiful escape? There are many things I still want to say.</p>
<p>A few days later, my pain eased and my mind was unusually comfortable. I thought, maybe this is a person's last reflection before death, but dying like this, like a dream, is also very peaceful. For me, it can be regarded as an ethereal detachment - I waited, I was about to see another world! So natural, I was not distressed at all, waiting quietly for the exchange between life and death!</p>
<p>My realm was clear and peaceful, without any disturbance. Everything in the world was isolated from me. I looked again and again, but I couldn't think of anything. Quiet night, in this quiet night my soul would leave my body!</p>
<p>Five hundred cc of saline solution was being injected, and I woke up. I realized that I was still alive, and that there was hope of living. On the bedside table were gifts and flowers sent by relatives and friends. The doctors and nurses all had smiles on their faces, asking me if the pain had stopped and how I was sleeping. I nodded slightly, indicating that I was okay.</p>
<p>A ray of sunlight was shining on my bedding, making people feel the arrival of spring. After a while, Ya Meng came, and my third brother also came, followed by many relatives and friends. They talked about the experiences of many people with appendicitis, how they got it, how they had surgery, and how they recovered, never mentioning the word "death." I knew they were giving me encouragement in spirit, and I also felt endless warmth. They hoped that I would live, looking at me and listening to me speak. And I have had more than thirty years of real feeling for the meaning of life; the joy of life can only be experienced and enjoyed by those who are alive!</p>
<p>The desire for life reoccupied my soul, and I continued to live! Although I had already had the experience of death, it was so peaceful, so natural.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 512</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Admirable, admirable!" Tsurumi complimented the young lady with phrases like praising a little tiger. "Your boxing skills are very high."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter!" She said lightly, but with a face full of smiles; she also sat back down in her original seat and placed the pistol she had taken out on the small round table next to her.</p>
<p>"I have two more questions to ask!"</p>
<p>"Very good, very good," Tsurumi also sat down, took out a handkerchief and wiped himself, "You may continue to enlighten me."</p>
<p>"Don't take offense: I want to ask, are you really Chinese, or Japanese?"</p>
<p>"Ha..." Tsurumi, upon hearing this sudden question, gave a dry laugh, like an old man with a full beard being asked by a naive child, "Why are there so many hairs on your face?" A similar situation; to explain it carefully would not only involve many profound theories and waste words, but it also might not convince this curious child. However, after letting out a dry laugh, his face immediately covered with a miserable and unhappy expression; because this question stirred his thinking mechanism, and immediately felt like a sharp thorn, suddenly piercing deep into his heart, and he immediately felt pain throughout his body.</p>
<p>This thorn touched his sense of identity; he strongly yearned for his mother, whom he had never met, and recalled his father, who had worked hard for national affairs, fell ill from overwork, and passed away halfway without fulfilling his ambitions. He yearned for his lonely life in a foreign land as a child, although he had the love of his adoptive mother Meiko, the care of Tsurumi Kiyoshi, the kindness of Little Source's wife, and the affection of his sibling Kikuko, there were still all kinds of uncoordinated hues naturally produced in the depths of his heart; this was impossible to console.</p>
<p>He also felt a inexplicable terror from this young lady's question; because from the tone of this young lady's speech, he could deduce that many other "friends" who had contacted or had not contacted him, how could he know that they did not have the same thoughts about his background? In everyone's mind? How could this "!" not evolve into a kind of "guess that is embarrassing to ask, and impossible to dispel doubts without asking"?</p>
<p>Tsurumi's nature was indeed upright and unrestrained, but even with such a sharp barb piercing straight into his heart, he could not help but feel miserable. Even other so-called magnanimous men of outstanding character, encountering similar pain, would not fail to have the same sensitivity as Tsurumi, but he seemed to feel it in his heart, and only remained silent on the surface. If he truly had no feeling, then he would be a person with a numb heart, and if his heart was numb, what kind of outstanding man would he be? Wouldn't he just be a fool?</p>
<p>Moreover, Tsurumi's childhood and adolescence were entirely formed in a narrow-minded Japanese social habit, it would be difficult for him to be particularly detached from the scope of this acquired educational force, and to achieve a very open-minded and unattached state, it would be a bit unbelievable. At this time, hearing this strange young lady's question, he couldn't help but feel a burst of pain in his heart. However, he didn't want to use words to analyze himself. He knew that the more he analyzed, the more he would cause suspicion, he wanted to use an objective way to prove it. Just as he hadn't grasped an objective way, the telephone bell in the room suddenly broke the awkward and dull situation.</p>
<h3>Strange "Unnecessary War"</h3>
<p>— Leike</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech when he accepted the city charter in Edinburgh, Scotland, declaring that World War II was the easiest war to prevent of all wars. He also recalled his conversation with the late US President Roosevelt in 1943: Roosevelt asked what name should be given to this war. Churchill replied, "The Second World War should be called an 'unnecessary war'." We don't know what the original words were, but judging from the report that translated it as "unnecessary war," it can be seen that the Chinese translation is not far from its original meaning.</p>
<p>Churchill's statement is admirable because he is not a hero who boasts about past achievements. Because if World War II was indeed an unnecessary thing, then his efforts to support the critical situation and help Britain through the crisis at that time would become an insignificant relic. It is strange why he held such a view of World War II, and even spoke so frankly to Roosevelt, the leader of the Allied countries, while the war was still in progress. Roosevelt, with his great mind, would not necessarily feel insulted by this, but old Churchill's thoughts were probably seen through. Old Churchill simply did not take the enemy seriously.</p>
<p>However, to the Chinese who fought for eight years against the Japanese, this sentence always feels insulting to the countless soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear who shed blood and sweat in this war, especially insulting to the sacred significance of our Chinese resistance to aggression and struggle for liberation. We were forced to take up arms to resist, and there was absolutely no expediency involved. This national self-defense war is completely different from Churchill's so-called easy or difficult to prevent.</p>
<p>Having said that, Churchill's words also have a warning effect. He made the fruits of victory worthless, so what about us? Have we thrown it in a corner and let it rot? If so, then how is our attitude any different from his sweeping negation? Perhaps they are just stubborn words from an old man, but in reality, they are cherishing and fully utilizing these fruits.</p>
<p>This is a terrible sentence. It was publicly spoken by a bold old man two years after the victory. It negates the significance of World War II. We must not let the mentality of this sentence spread, because this is ultimately not a question of whether it should or should not be said!</p>

<h3>Angola is Haunted</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Central News Agency's dispatch from Ankara, Turkey, reported the news of haunting in the British Embassy in Turkey. The original text was vivid and detailed. The general idea was that the residence of Lieutenant Colonel Ashley, the army attaché of the embassy, was originally built on a cemetery. Under the house, there was the tomb of a Muslim pastor, who seemed to be protesting from underground from time to time, making the house a haunted house, and even making the temporary homeowner - the beautiful wife of that lieutenant colonel, hear the ghost's voice, see the ghost's color (an old man in white), and even talk to the ghost. It was said so vividly, as if it were true.</p>
<p>If this kind of ghost story happened in a Muslim family that believes in ghosts and gods, or among the native Turks, it would not be a new thing. The strangest thing is that it happened in the official residence of an important figure in the diplomatic corps, and in the home of a British person who believes in science and does not believe in ghosts and monsters, which made friends who believe in souls argue strongly.</p>
<p>It is said that I have read Dr. Wu Qianfang's book on souls, and the newspaper also recorded that when his family took a photo, his wife, who had been dead for many years, suddenly appeared in the photo, and other strange news.</p>
<p>Not many days later, I found a book translated by Mr. Meng Xiancheng called "Ghost Language" in an old bookstore, which recorded many strange stories of communicating with ghosts. These are all new ghost stories of the 20th century, which Pu Songling never had. Metaphysics seems to be on the rise, but it will soon be defeated by the most realistic science.</p>
<p>In fact, seeing ghosts in broad daylight should be "commonplace" in this world of man-made ghostly shadows, and it is not just Angola that is haunted.</p>
<p>Everyone has seen the famous movie "The Blue Angel", right? The story takes place in a haunted house, which scares a young and beautiful wife to death. But the ghost in that house was originally played by the male owner who could perform magic tricks.</p>
<p>In this world, there are more ghosts than people. Ghosts are people, and people are ghosts. Ghosts are the returning, so why bother to distinguish between people and ghosts?</p>
<p>I also make such associations and inferences about the ghosts in the official residence of British Lieutenant Colonel Ashley in Ankara, because it is too similar to the plot in "The Blue Angel".</p>
<p>The opening phrase of each paragraph of the Islamic Koran often has the sentence "God drives away demons and ghosts". In fact, it should be changed to "God drives away people", that would be the right thing to do.</p>
<h3>Jiang Ying Solo Concert — Famous Lyric Soprano</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>May is the season of music. The recent Shanghai music scene appears so prosperous and active. Following the second performance of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music held a grand concert of teachers and students on the 18th and 19th of this month. However, an even more noteworthy solo concert - the solo concert of Ms. Jiang Ying, a famous lyric soprano, will be held at the Lyceum on the 31st of this month. This is her first solo concert in Shanghai. I would like to recommend this famous Chinese lyric soprano, who recently returned from the European music scene, to the Shanghai music audience with excitement. Ms. Jiang Ying is the third daughter of the late famous Chinese military expert Mr. Jiang Baili. She has been fond of music since she was a child. She studied at McTyeire School in this city. In the spring of 1936, she traveled to Europe with her father. In 1937, she entered the Berlin Conservatory of Music for further study, and graduated in 1942. Then, she studied sacred music with Duari, a modern sacred music singer with a very famous Jiang. Just in time for the fierce European war, she transferred to Switzerland. On the one hand, she specialized in Wagner's opera with Koga, an expert in Wagner's opera, and served as Koga's teaching assistant; on the other hand, she also entered the Zurich Conservatory of Music, learning theory from Persky. Between 1944 and 1945, she was invited to participate in the International Music Festival for performance because of her excellent grades.</p>
<p>She has been specializing in music art in Europe for more than ten years. After returning to China this time, Mr. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, specially introduced her to the cultural figures of this city at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 4:30 pm on the 16th of this month. Under the enthusiastic welcome and invitation of everyone, she sang two moving songs on the spot - an aria from the opera "Carmen" and Schubert's "Song of Eternal Life". The tone is clear and beautiful, the pronunciation is clear, and it is full of expression, revealing exquisite cultivation and attainments.</p>
<p>The solo concert is scheduled to be held at the Lyceum on the 31st of this month. This is her first concert after returning to China. The program includes famous songs and famous opera works from Germany, Italy, and France. Mr. Magolins, a famous professor at the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music, will be in charge of the accompaniment. We expect that this solo concert will introduce an outstanding soprano to the Shanghai music scene, and her singing will surely attract a wide audience.</p>
<h3>Talking About Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, the most benefited people in the world were the relief supplies distributed by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the affected countries around the world. There are many types of such relief supplies, including not only the necessities of clothing, food, and housing, but also machinery, vehicles, medicines, etc., which can be said to be all-encompassing.</p>
<p>It is not known what happened to these relief supplies after they were transported to other countries. In China, the Executive Yuan Relief Committee and local branches managed this matter. The various situations are often seen in the newspapers, so there is no need to say more. Here, I will only talk about some common relief supplies received by general public and educational personnel and school institutions.</p>
<p>These common relief supplies are mainly clothing and food.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about clothing: The clothes distributed by the Relief Administration are of course mostly old clothes, but in my opinion, old clothes can be divided into two categories. One category is probably donated by the American people, which is more mixed, including men's suits, overcoats, shirts, women's coats, pants, long skirts, valuable to leather coats, and awkward to broken socks. The other category is old military uniforms of American soldiers, wool, khaki, cloth, and khaki dresses worn by American women in military service, all in one style and one color, which are more uniform. Of the two categories of old clothes, the former is more practical although it is mixed, especially things that can keep warm such as suits and overcoats. Last year, I lived in a certain city in Zhejiang, and saw the county government distributing old clothes to all public and educational personnel in the county. In order to ensure that the quality was not uneven, they used a lottery method. As a result, those who had good luck drew suits and overcoats, and those who had bad luck drew broken socks and broken hats. An old gentleman even drew a "sanitary belt", which made people laugh and cry, it can be said to be a "prank". As for the old military uniforms, some were so tattered that they could only be used as shoe pads, and some were very new and could be worn, but foreign soldiers were tall, and Chinese people looked like "flies hiding in bean pods" after wearing them, which was not very elegant. There is another troublesome thing: those old military uniforms were marked with "buttons returned", because the buttons had the American national emblem, and people from other countries could not wear them, but that kind of button was crimped on with a machine, and it was impossible to remove them unless the clothes were cut into a hole. It is said that several poor people were reluctant to cut the clothes, did not remove the buttons, and wore them on the street. When they were seen by American soldiers, they were forced to take them off, and they were slapped twice. I don't know if this is true? If it is true, it is also sad.</p>
<p>Let's talk about food again. The variety of food distributed by the Relief Administration is simply amazing. In addition to the main staples of rice, wheat, and beans, the iron-headed foods piled up like mountains are really dazzling. Milk, meat, fruits, sugar, sauce, ... It really takes three days and three nights to count them all! Of course, these foods are all delicious and nutritious, and they are all urgently needed by a group of poor, sick, and weak people, but after eight years of war, there are really too many poor, sick, and weak people, and a drop in the bucket is of no help. Last year, when I was in Zhejiang, I saw a certain charity organization received ten boxes of beef, and suddenly seven or eight hundred miserable people crowded at the door and refused to leave. The host had no choice but to give each of them a dish to "taste the flavor".</p>
<h3>Secrets Secrets</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Lily: "Ruth told me that you told her about that secret that I told you not to tell her."</p>
<p>Peggy: "She's such a despicable thing! I told her not to tell you."</p>
<p>Lily: "Yes, I told her I wouldn't tell you what she told me, so don't tell her that I told you."</p>
<h3>Starting with Glass Chopsticks</h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>If you inspect the citizens of this city, everyone has at least one nylon product, even the most plain person, he will have a glass comb or a glass toothbrush. As for being a modern lady, she can be fully equipped with "plastic" (Plastic). From glass stockings to glass pins. Originally, plastic industrialists had already said that this is a plastic era, but it can occupy our department stores, but no one would have thought that it would also penetrate into our Eastern way of life.</p>
<p>Two days ago, the United Press sent a telegram from Seattle, saying that a company called Fanlagong Plastic Products Company is now manufacturing glass chopsticks with a gray steel machine, which can produce twelve chopsticks per minute. The chopsticks are light as feathers, bright in color, and will not change shape at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of this batch of chopsticks will be sold in China, competing with Chinese handicraft chopsticks. Therefore, just as other nylon products are popular among Chinese people, the United Press reporter finally predicted that it will be popular in the Far East.</p>
<p>After reading this telegram, there is one sentence that is chilling, which is that it will compete with Chinese handicraft chopsticks. When our national industry is still full of handicraft colors, this sentence has too many threats. We believe that once glass chopsticks come to the East, our bamboo chopsticks and artificial ivory chopsticks will be eclipsed, because these beautiful glass chopsticks are indeed made by a gray steel machine, as specially pointed out by the United Press reporter, which is both beautiful and hygienic.</p>
<p>If the United Press reporter sent this telegram not to promote Fanlagong Company in advance, then he must be warning our chopstick-making workers to change careers with sympathy. Look, this is a typhoon signal. It predicts that our Eastern life has collapsed, starting from the Western industry manufacturing Eastern chopsticks. Mr. Lu</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Grand Historian Yu Biyun</h3>
<p>— Lu Shi</p>
<p>The Grand Historian's name is Jieqing, and he is from Deqing, West Zhejiang. He was born in the Tongzhi year of Wuchen, so his nickname is Along. He is the grandson of Yu Yue, the great Confucian of the late Qing Dynasty, and the father of Mr. Pingbo, a modern literary figure. He was born with an extraordinary talent, short in body and fair in skin, with a particularly large head and hands that could reach his knees, so there was a legend that he was the reincarnation of an arhat. In the Guangxu year of Wuxu, he was the third place in the first class, and was selected as a Tan Hua (third place in the imperial examination) and edited in the Hanlin Academy and was later sent to Sichuan as the chief examiner. Afterwards, he encountered misfortune, and his career was not prominent. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, he had no intention of serving as an official. He lived in the old capital as a lodger and is still alive and well. Mr. Lan Xunqing is like the only survivor of the Jia Dynasty.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Grand Historian came to the South to sweep tombs and resided in Yulou on the West Lake for about half a month. His beard and eyebrows were as white as snow, very similar to the old god of longevity in the painting. Only the maid Xueer served him on the left and right. Xueer was graceful and skilled in poetry and painting. The Grand Historian's brushstrokes were delicate and weak, and Xueer imitated them with lifelike skill. Half of those who asked the Grand Historian to paint were done by this beautiful woman. That month, they floated on a painted boat in the depths of the lake and mountains at night. The Grand Historian played Kunqu opera, and Xueer played the flute. Tourists came to watch the spectacle. The Grand Historian was not recognized, and the next day, Hangzhou spread the news that immortals had descended, which was also a beautiful story of the West Lake.</p>
<p>In his later years, he lived in Beiping and encountered political upheavals and wars. He stopped writing. He has a hundred poems of wandering immortals, borrowing stories from Xiang Zhangshuo, etc. He describes the love between men and women in the world with the utmost tenderness and flamboyant charm. One day, Mr. Pingbo will edit and publish them. Then, there will be another style in the history of Chinese literature.</p>
<h3>Art and Literature Circle</h3>
<p>Ms. Tang Yunyu's oil painting exhibition has been held on the second floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. Since the week of the exhibition, the audience has been enthusiastic and well received. In response to the requirements of all parties, a special extension will be held on the 19th (Monday).</p>
<p>Wu Zuguang's mythological farce "Catching Ghosts" has been published by Kaiming Bookstore.</p>
<h3>The Business Philosophy of Taer Monastery</h3>
<p>— Li Puyuan</p>
<p>There was such a thing in Xining: A department store opened by a Han or Hui person. One day, a Kazak went to buy cloth. Because of the language barrier, the shopkeeper stretched out five fingers to explain the price of one foot of cloth. The buyer shook his head and took out five silver dollars to pay the price. At that time, the price of Xining silver dollars was 17 legal currency to one. A comrade told the author the story, and I said: "This is not necessarily the shopkeeper wanting to deceive ethnic minorities, but the language is to blame!"</p>
<p>Before and after the Taer Monastery sunning scriptures, not only food, British goods, Indian goods, Tibetan goods, and inland goods are all based on the regulations of Rushar, and are set up next to the main road, with tents of about 15 feet square, one after another to welcome people from various races, various accents, and various costumes. They swarm to buy things all day long. Even on the entire small mountain where love songs are sung, people who buy and sell livestock are scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>It was a clear and bright afternoon. I went west from Wenhua Town with one or two comrades and walked up the mountain from another convenient path. Before my panting had settled, I saw a strange thing. In front of me was a livestock market. Mongolian sheep, Tibetan sheep, cattle, Tibetan horses, and Qinghai mules were all tied with a rope, one end tied around the neck of the livestock and the other end fixed on the green grass on the ground - the appearance was very funny, as if the livestock would be blown away by the wind. Next to the livestock, there were Kazaks, Tibetans, Mongols ... all kinds of businessmen. Among them, there was one who was in his twenties, thin, of medium build, with a very good complexion and a pair of quite intelligent big eyes. He seemed to have been seen in Rushar before. He was also squatting there, bargaining with a Tibetan who was selling Tibetan sheep. This person spoke Tibetan very well. When he reached into the sleeve of the sheep owner's white felt sheepskin robe, his movements attracted our attention. We were watching them.</p>
<p>Talking in words that we couldn't understand at all, he whispered to the Tibetan wearing a white felt hat for a long time. Then, he happily asked a few sentences in Turkish to another Hui. The Hui seemed very happy too, and immediately took out legal currency of ten yuan from his waist pocket and handed it to the sheep owner through him. The Tibetan's facial expression was very surprised, and he spoke in Tibetan, wanting to return the money. However, the young broker refused to accept it, and seemed to be satirizing him, mocking him. The sheep owner was angry. Since the money was given to the broker and he refused to accept it, he threw it on the ground and immediately pulled the rope of the Tibetan sheep and squatted there. The broker seemed to want to use force, but when he saw us wearing straw-woven uniforms, he retreated!</p>
<p>We understood his feelings and slipped to the department store stalls on the other side of the mountain. All the way, I thought of the five fingers and five silver dollars of Xining.</p>
<p>At a cloth stall, I asked about the price of a piece of British serge. He said: "Selling it to the Tibetans is 60 national currency, if you want it, sir, I'll give it to you for 30!" But, just as a group of female chieftains from the Yushu area came, we felt embarrassed for the cloth merchant and did not dare to make a deal, and quickly walked to the second store!</p>
<p>Ah, the business philosophy of Taer Monastery! How can you convince the ethnic minorities in the border areas!</p>
