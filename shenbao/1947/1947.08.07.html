<p>〔本報兗州六日電〕魯西南大殲滅戰激劇進行，國軍已勝算在握，原被國軍分別包圍之劉伯誠，陳毅殘部，其中陳毅之第一·四·八·十·四個縱隊及五縱隊之十三師，經國軍連日闈擊、已僅剩約兩萬人，於四日夜突圍，竄運河以西地區，企圖與劉伯誠部合流，再渡黃河北竄，五日起經嘉祥，鄆城與渡運河追擊部隊夾盤後，該匪又被包圍於聞口中，大長溝一帶，刻正包圍中。劉伯誠之第一·二·三·六·七等五個縱隊殘部，經連日糾集，向黃口臨淮集國軍作孤注一擲後，冀口雖因眾寡懸殊被侵入，並有一部殘匪强渡黃河，後經濮縣陽穀向冠縣急竄，但其丰刀仍被國軍包國於臨濮集，仲　堆，范屯之中間地區，不難全殲。連日國空軍正無分書夜轟炸共匪在沿河所設數百渡船及數十渡口，共匪被炸落水者日以千計。</p>

<h3>對日貿易指導委會　經部正積極籌組　日掠取我物品歸還困難</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕對日貿易指導委會，正由經部積極籌組中，此一機構成立後，赴日商務代表團人選即經其審查，然後由政院通過公布，聞代表團最早亦須於九月一日方可啟行。又工協理事長吳缊初七日來京後，將招待新聞界，報告對開放對日貿易意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京六日電〕中國駐日代表團賠償歸還組組長吳半農稱：中國被掠之大批物品，雖知現存日本，唯因中國原主所提證據不足或因要求方法不合，致使此種贓品之歸還極爲困難，至少歸還期日將大為延緩。若干物主僅謂：彼等所有財產為日人掠去，唯未提出證據證明物品爲其所有，而支持其聲明，此種於手續不合之申請，使中國代表團須興中國政府往還函件七八次，方能獲得可以爲盟國當局接受之表格。中國物主不明瞭歸還要求手續，因之物品之歸還日期拖延甚久。中國被日本擄來之物品中，計府船隻一三〇艘，工廠二十所（大部係自廣州掠來者），汽車若干翻以及其他物品，然目前歸還原主者，僅有少數般隻與工廠，公事手續以及日本政府之無效率，使歸還時日緩延甚久，中國代表團每週提出申請十五至廿件，然未獲何種結果，國人之申請歸還物品者，首應提川文件或照片，，證明其所有權，繳入登記證，並略述物品被掠之時間地點與當時情形，如以汽車爲例，引擎及車身號碼均應提出。又如所有權之證明或登記證遣失毀　，則美國及其他國家之出售店或海關，均可予以協助。總之，物主如不能提出充分設明以證明其請求，則被掠物品之償還，爲期當緩延甚久。</p>
<h3>對日和會問題　美將照會蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓五日電〕此間消息靈通方面稱：目前對於蘇聯之局勢倘能及時加以廓淸，則美國將發出請柬，邀請各國出席九月初之封日和會，美國現將於一二日內照會蘇聯，糾正蘇聯所言和約應由外長會議草擬，而不許遠東委員會十一國以平等地位參加和會之立塲，倘蘇聯仍堅持其立塲，則美國將徵詢其他國家之意見，倘多數國家贊成不必蘇聯參加則進行其事，則美國當即發出請柬。</p>
<p>此外又悉：澳大利亞大使馬金會通知國務院，告以澳政府認爲召開和會不應如美國所提代表標準之建議，應有較高之標準，懊政府由希望其外長能自始即行參加此項和會，此即不贊成召開外次會議之謂。據官方稱：美國不致堅持其立塲，可能先由主要人員進行此項會議，然後再行舉行外次會議。</p>
<p>中國對於日本和約，主張各項決麟應由中，蘇，英，美四强中之三國及十一國中三分之二之多數票表示同意後，始能成立。美國認爲中國乃因若不修改否決權深恐將危及其利益，遂提出此項主張，關於保留日本大量經濟復興力一事，聞中國與英，美之立塲亦不一致，今中國主張三分之二票數之表決程序，殆可藉此取得蘇聯之支持，以維持中國之立塲，但在召開對日和會時，賠償問題倘仍未能由遠東委員會加以解決，則中國惟能賴美國之支持能取得較大之分配額。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：夏威夷國會議員法林登建議，對日和約應在夏威夷簽訂，謂太平洋戰爭在此爆發，且地據太平洋中心，故夏威夷實爲簽訂對日和約最理想之地點。</p>

<h3>制止港澳大量走私　我已採嚴峻措置　董顯光葉公超答記者問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕政院新聞局今日下午四時半舉行記者招待會，董顯光局長答復記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>（問）聯總建議將五萬噸教濟物資運往中共區域，政府表示同意否？聯總停止以物責運華北，是否合理，</p>
<p>（答）政府對於共區久受苦難之人民，極為切，渴顯聯總物資眞能到達共區人民之手，如果確與上述救濟人民之目的不相背馳，則政府對於物資運往共區，并不反對。至於聯總暫停以物資運華北，是否合理，似宜留給聯總答覆。</p>
<p>（問）孚中及揚子兩公司進口之物品，何者政府認爲違背進口條例？</p>
<p>（答）據財政部八月一日發表之調查報告，孚中及楊子兩公司所進口之物品，並無違背進口條例者，孚中公司有代客經手之卡特拉克牌汽車二輛，起初海關不准放行，旋經證明此兩車係用過之舊車，一九四二年造，且係代客報關，並非出售者，故得依法進口。</p>
<p>（問）向香港，澳門走私進口之數量，中國政府之佔計如何？何者爲走私之生要物品？馬尼刺訛傳，自澳門有大量黃金進口，是否屬實？政府採取何種步驟制止走私，曾否要求港，澳，英，葡當局協助制止走私？</p>
<p>（答）自香港澳門走私之數量，即使粗作估計，倘非不可能，亦屬漢分困難。據一九四六年統計，全國各地所沒收之進出口走私物品，約共值一百十三億元，走私入口之主要物品，爲毛織品，紙烟，肥皂，蘇打，化粧品，棉紗，人參，與麵粉，其中以毛織品爲最，走私出口之物品類，皆經由港澳兩地，爲鎢，蛋類，銀幣，及國產藥材等項。關於自澳門偷運黃金入口一節，並無所聞。政府已採取各種嚴唆措置，以杜絕走私，最近派駐隣近香港邊界之緝私人員，業已加倍，現緝私設備亦大爲改善，除原有緝私船隻而外，已增加快速艦艇。</p>
<p>關於自香港澳門之走私一問題，外部業次長公超曾作補充報告如下：中國政府對於香港及澳門方面日漸增加之大量走私，表示嚴重之關切，外部曾迭次要求英外交部及香港政府，及早與我方成立一有效之緝私協定，但英方迄無答復，中國雖己在研究嚴峻之緝私辦法，準備施行於我國邊境，但仍切望英國政府同樣了解此問題之嚴軍　，使出入香港之大量走私，可根據中英雙方所同意之合作緝私辦法，而被有效地制止。</p>
<p>（問）美國裴發教授關於主張藉停止援華以促成中國改革之言論，董局長有何意見？</p>
<p>（答）裴斐教授最近發表「退出中國之時」一文，其中稱：制止蘇聯在華發展有三種可資抉擇之方法：（一）中國政府實施政治革新，裴氏謂·此事需要時間。（二）美國至少以一百萬軍隊駐在中國邊境，惟謂此非美國民意所許可。（三）美國退出中國，同時使蘇聯亦作同樣行動，據謂此係避免對蘇戰爭之唯一辦法，裴氏此文，似暗示中國爲國際戰爭之　生地，予當聲明中國絕無將美國或其他國家牽人戰爭之企圖。過去之戰爭，中國已備受苦痛，如再有戰爭，對吾人有害而無利。斐氏所稱中國需要革新政治一節，不失爲建設性之意見，然若曲解中國革新政治為敷衍門面，以期獲得國外財政這援助，則祇足爆露其對中國國策之隔膜，中國實施革新政治之發動，已有相當時間，所以不能有　著之成效者，質因共匪叛亂，時爲阻障之故。政府雖有其缺點，然中國倘能舉行民意測騐，深信絕大多數之人民，仍必擁護政府，而鄙棄造成混亂而　渔利之共匪。</p>
<h3>北塔山事件二次抗議　我接獲蘇聯答覆　葉外次稱政府正加考慮</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕外部葉次長公超六日於新聞局記者招待會中，答覆有關於外交問題之詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，關於新疆事件之第二次抗議，已接瑛蘇方或外裴之答覆否？</p>
<p>答，外交部已於八月五日收到蘇聯政府答糧中國政府對於北塔山事件第二次抗議之照會，我政府現正根據蘇方之新答覆加以考慮。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京六日電〕葉公超稱，關於中英商約英方草案，中國早已提出對案，送達英外交部將近六月，但英方迄未闡明立塲。此事或係由於印度，緬甸及馬來等地局勢變化所致。</p>
<h3>今後五個月追加預算　約達一萬四千億　文武待遇合一本月實施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕政院預算審查委會，六日晨開會，王　五主席，重要決議：（一）文武職人員待遇合一，八月起實施。（二）八，九，十，十一，十二五個月，追加預算總約一萬四千億。（三）八月份公務員薪津調整後，預算另予增加。（四）原擬依據職務給薪，現按階級支付，中校以下按藘委任，上校·少將·中將安簡任，上將安特任，上述各案定下週二提政務會，下週五提國務會，俟通過公布施行。又會中通過故宮博物院古物遷移費三十餘億，北平文化整理費廿億。</p>
<h3>中常會昨舉行例會　通過四中全會議題　李濟琛鼓動民變開除黨籍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國民黨中常會六日上午九時舉行例會，戴傳賢主席，通過要案如下；（一）中央黨團聯席會識及四中全會議題爲「如何加强本黨革命組織，革新政治，完成戰亂建國貫澈後期革命之任務」。（二）各級黨國統一組織辦法。（三）中央監察委會決議，以李濟琛最近在港擅發宣言，鼓動民變，應予開除黨籍，決議照辦。（四）對民肚黨請求分配立委。監委名額一百餘名事，不作任何保障，惟國民黨願予民社黨協助，下午一時半散會。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕民社黨昨晨九時舉行全代大會後之首次中常會，出席常委十六人，由張君勱主席，討論一般例案外，溪議謂整中央人事如次：（一）秘書長金侯城，副秘書長楊毓滋，孫亞夫，（二）組織部長戰翼翹，副部長程緝之，馮今白，（三）宣傳部營長徐傳霖，副部長蔣勻田，崔心一，（四）社會部長吳正，副部長陳逃昆，李志愼，（五）海外部長由楊凌明暫代，副部長楊灘明，鄭天械，（六）婦女長羅靜軒，副部長陳定秀，（七）選舉事務所主任王世憲，（八）政務研究委員會總幹事李微　，（九）中常會秘書劉中一，（十）發言人崔心　，（十一）駐京代表蔣勻田。</p>
<p>〔本報訊」民社黨「革新委員會」與「海外各總支部」，昨日午後三時半招待新聞界，發表聯合聲明，要點爲：（一）不承認民肚黨召開之全代大會。（二）民社黨係由國家社曾黨與海外民憲黨合併組成，今革新派與海外黨員聯合，依黨之租成力量此較，已佔全黨四分之三。（三）推副主席伍憲子爲代理主席，並定八月十五日在滬召開第一次代表大會。據革新派要員表示：「將來出席全代大會之代表在七十人以上，海外代表至少有四人。張東孫已決定參加，費孝通·潘光旦等尚無正式表示。余等對內之卞張爲和平民主統一，在外交上則主張在美蘇兩强之間，居於不偏不倚之中立地位」。</p>
<h3>民社地方代表　亦組織聯誼會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨之內部裂痕］除革新派及海外總支部之外，經此次全代大會後］又發生一　新的糾紛：因在此次大會中，省市代表七十餘人已組成一聯誼會，彼等與民社黨中央衝突甚烈，據出席代表汪仁俊·李襄東等表示：中央用「遴選代表」之辦法，使本應居於多數地位之省市代表，根本無法表達其意見，而在重要表決中，均居於劣勢地位，而在選舉中委時，盡由少數人士把持，出席代表對開票無監督權，致弊端重重。同時代表之產生，作風亦欠民主。例如貴州中委伍行之，本已選出，然張君勱命其辭職。目前民社黨中央已視省市代表聯誼會爲「第二們革新委員會」，而聯誼會亦決心鬥爭，希望達成兩目的：（一）使張君勱走上正道，（二）淸除張君勳左右之把持人物。同時，聯誼會代表指出民社黨內不少要員於戰時有附敵嫌疑，現正搜集證據，將公開檢舉。</p>

<h3>社論　華南走私的嚴重！</h3>
<p>香港政府最近發表了這半年來的貿易統計，其中有一項特別使我們注意。這就是過去半年間香港輸出鎢砂九百五十噸，而有同一時期內，輸入鎢砂僅四百噸，而且更值得我們注意的是；在過去六個月間蘇聯商務機關代表在港大事搜購鎢砂，香港對蘇聯的鎢砂輸出，包括了同一時期輪入的鎢砂而有餘，可見蘇聯代表在港搜購鎢砂，不遺餘力。此項消息的傳來，使我們對於若干問題，不得不再度加以注意。第一，自然是華南走私問題的嚴重；第二是資源委員會的收購政策；第三，便是蘇聯對於鎢砂需要的激增。</p>
<p>鎢是鍊鋼所必需。中國的鍊鋼事業雖不發達，但我們得天獨厚，世界鎢砂的產量却要占到百分之七十五以上。粵桂贛邊區便是世界著名的產鎢區域。自抗戰起後，鎢砂因爲是我國主要的礦齋輪出，便由資源委員會統制其事。當年美國飛機一架一架地越駝峯而來到我們中國的時侯，載去的也就有了鎢砂。鎢砂便是我們換取外匯的一種主要商品。如今抗戰雖告勝利結束，我們因爲有債務的關係需要換取外匯，所以鎢砂還歸資源委員會統制。香港政府所發表的統計，明示我們在過去六個月間香港輸入的鎢砂爲四百噸，而輸出的爲九百五十噸，是則至少有五百五十噸的鎢砂是以走私的方式輸入香港的；其中以走私輸入而尚未輸出的數字，自然更無法統計。鎢既是華南的礦產，從而可知華南的走私是如何嚴重。</p>
<p>本來講到華南的走私，一般人的猜測，以爲奸商利用香港，而逃避了我們的關稅和貿易管制，他們大都著重在輸入，其實在輸出方面的走私也早已是一個大漏洞。並且這種種驚人的走私，幾乎自抗戰初期起就存在着，不過「於今爲烈」罷了。政府有關當局，對於華南走私局勢的嚴重，原不竹忽視；輪出入當局曾一再南行，商討防制之策。其奈利之所在，眾人所趨，此風終不能戰，近且有變本加厲之勢。據說其中糾織嚴密，規模宏大，不但奸商活躍。而且有官僚和軍人爲其後台，其營私誤國，眞是駭人聲聞，如何逃止走私，從根本上言，自應積極設法收回港九，使香港不再享有特殊地位，但這似乎一時未必就能實現。我們應該嚴加緝私，並且對於緝私人員應該待遇從優，重其獎賞，而尤要者，是對貪官污吏，不法軍人，以及和他們勾通的奸商，須亳不寬假的嚴懲，走私之風，或可稍息。</p>
<p>然而走私之所以有走私，當然還有主要的經濟原因，就是有利可圖。單以鎢砂而論，香港市塲每擔的價格，約在美金一百元，而中國政府收購的價格，據說僅抵市塲價格三分之一，就是說政府以相等於美金三十元的官價收購鎢砂，在產鎢或經營鎢砂的人，要使他們每擔損失六十餘元美金。此一損失，是相當可觀的，在此情勢之下，鎢砂的走私，乃成爲他們唯一的出路。我們所不解的是；收購官價的太低，無異鼓勵走私。這究竟是否是政府的正當政策？還是政府裏有若干官吏故意製造這個漏洞？如果我們要制止鎢砂的走私，那未，從根本上著想，便得將收購官價重行考慮，使從事於走私的人無利可圖，然後走私之風，不禁而自戢。</p>
<p>我們於此，又不能不想起的是蘇聯的大量收購鎢砂，無　地，表示它的積極有充實它的鍊鋼軍需工業，實爲它的整飭軍備的象徵。原來蘇聯自實施第三五年計劃以來，它的一切努力，便在集中於軍備。鎢砂的收購，無疑地，在表示它的在積極準備製造兵器，以備世界第三大戰的來臨。我們握有世界鎢產的控制權，而我們自己却未能利用此自然的賦予，怎不令人痛心！</p>
<h3>我對印荷爭端　政策堅定明顯　雙方筆下突須立即終止</h3>
<p>外部發言人談</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於印荷衝突，我外部經愼重考慮後，六日由發言人發表談話云；中國政府政策甚爲堅定明顯，第一，在政治原則上，中國政府同情於印尼之解放，並主張印荷軍事衝突必須立即終止。基於此一政策我政府在此次印荷實突發生前，曾與英美政府一致求取衝突之避免，在衝突發生後，我駐安全理事會代表立即投票主張由聯合國鄧令停戰，此與英法比三國當時所採之立塲絕不相同；第二，我政府訊爲荷蘭政府必須履行其對保護華僑之法律責任，印尼必須停止適用焦土政策於華僑之生命財產，中國之此種要求，實即國際公法與人道主義之要求，我政府決不以任何原因而予忽視。此次荷方曾在若干地方搶救受難華僑，較諸過云顯然更為盡力，印尼方面亦經應允阻止印尼軍隊之暴行，現衝突雖告停止，我政府對於華僑安全與救濟問題，仍在繼續交涉中。</p>
<p>閩僑務處建議　護僑辦法四點</p>
<p>〔本報福州六日電〕荷印戰亂，我百萬僑胞生命財產亳無保陣，閩省僑務處頃電中央，建議護僑辦法四點：（一）請國聯安理會鄧令荷印雙方切實保護中立國僑民；（二）中國應參加制裁；（三）中央速派大員赴荷印宜慰難僑及向當地政府交涉賠償損失；（四）運送難僑返國或請國際難民機構協助派輪運僑，在國內設廠安置。</p>

<p>諸君（指洖洲人民）想必認織吾人已遭攻擊，安現會茍不要求侵略者退出佔領之土地，則安理會之宗旨，顯然己遭擊敗。荷蘭蔣其發動之戰爭·而獲得之目標，如不僅依照此一方式予以制裁，則調處亦屍無用。其先夏氏向共和國議會工作委員會致辭，聲明共和國不能接受調處，祇能接受聯合國委員會之仲裁。渠指責於停戰令生效後之兩小時半，荷軍又佔領日惹迤西一百哩處之岡朋。印尼副總統哈泰在蘇門答臘廣搖，聲言荷方既已破壞停戰令，共和國亦得還擊。荷軍公報則稱，荷軍目前所採行動爲「保護措施」，與上屋期之「警察行動」不同，聲明荷電在馬圖拉島之活動係保護產米區，至於爪哇東部泗水迤西一帶及中部岡朋一帶之行動，則均於停戰令生效之前完成。此間觀察家相信，印荷幾方對於停戰令均未遵從。</p>

<h3>數千年宗敎陶冶　五族獲堅強團結　潘議長茶會歡迎回敎朝聖國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕回敎朝聖國一行四十人，由團長艾伯都拉大毛拉，副團長乃孜爾大阿　率領，前往聖地阿刺伯麥加，參興九月三日之朝聖大典·道經京滬，在京曾觀見蔣主席，報告邊情，於日前搭車抵滬，候輪首途，連日拜訪本市各黨政機關及宗教團體。市參議會潘議長，昨日上午十一時舉行茶會歡迎，謝請該會同教徒參議員多人作陪，席問潘議長致詞，表示歡迎之意。並謂：中國爲一文化古國，國內之宗教及民族，原不止一種，惟數千年來之陶冶，已將各民族及各宗教之同胞，團結一致，蔚爲一偉大之中華民國。</p>
<p>値得吾人永久紀念</p>
<p>回敎自阿刺伯傳人中國以後，我國人民，不論爲何種民族，信徒均日有增加，以地域而論，則西北各省及邊疆爲如此，即長江珠江及黃河流城亦然，各地均有淸眞寺及同教信徒，由此可以證明同教文化亦巳構成中國文化之一部份，而與中國文化不能分離；偶人認爲文化溝通爲國家團結之要素，吾人必需在溝通文化工作方面去努力，然後才能獲得五族團結之堅强黨　。今日新疆靑海及西北各省之朝聖團同胞來滬，此尚爲勝利後第一次，尤以此行目的在赴回教聖地朝觀，而所經路程已縱貫中國國土及首都上海等大都市，對於溝通文化工作，帮助甚大，故此行之意義，至爲深長，值得吾人永久紀念。</p>
<p>對於國家貢獻甚大</p>
<p>同想中國歷史上，尤以隋唐之世，在唐太宗之全盛時代，以及郭子儀之中興時代，政治軍事方面很多有名人物，均爲回教信徒，或回　及突厥人，對國家有很大貢獻。換言之，新無及邊省同胞過去對國家已有很大功動，並且相信此後必定如歷史上所表現之事蹟，邊涯同胞將繼續對國家作種種更偉大之貢獻。中庸有言；「萬物並育而不相害，道並行而不相悖」，此即爲中國精神之最高表現，吾人願以此相勉。就上海言，參議會爲民意機關，參議員中籍貫，宗教信仰雖不同，然均能一致爲市政建設而合作，吾人希望於全體回教同胞者亦復如是，一致爲國家建設而努力。</p>
<p>市長舉行茶會招待</p>

<h3>岳陽永成垸復耕　湖南農業機械革命的曙光</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙訊〕湖南過去爲中國之米倉，民間有「湖廣熱，天下足」之　，但我們中國全國的農業，都還停留在原始時代’純恃風調雨順，天時地利，假如風不調，雨不順，則不論水畢蟲各種災歉一來，農民皆無力抗拒。戰後農村中被毀壞的，除了一片憔悴的枯野之外，凡耕種所需的人力，畜力，農具，種子，肥料，塘壩等，一無所有，湘分署自卅四年冬成立以來，即曾竭全力使農村復耕，發給農具，稻種，菜種，肥料，貸款，購牛，補助治蟲，力求農村及時復耕。去年得以勉强波過災荒，今年則豐收可望。惟此種發放工作，終屬治標，湘分署給束後，恐很難繼續，我國農業實有革新之必要，興辦新農業，方是治本的久遠之計。</p>
<p>湘分署對於此一方面之工作，以岳陽曳引機復耕訓練區爲機械農塲之示範，曾向總　請配曳引機四十部，現已到二十部，已招收學員五十人，訓練復耕永成垸。永成垸有面積六萬畝，現有三萬畝爲荒地，蘆柴高達七八尺，飛禽走獸，藏匿其間，待全部復耕後，可容一萬五千戶，農戶每戶以五口計算，則將有七萬五千戶靠此生活。永成垸工作之試騐，使農民深感興趣，而且發生信念，可見農民並不是太保守的，只要有毅力做，還是可改革。永成垸只是新農業的開端，整個湖南農業的革新，前程尙屬遠大。　湘分署所辦農村中之新事業，尙有開塘機訓練班，曾訓練七個技師，在衡陽開塘廿口，成績甚佳。現在岳陽永成垸之工作，配到抽水機四十一部，已由湘分署組織水利灌溉隊，於七八兩個月中，往需要之縣份工作。</p>
<p>農村中另一嚴重問題，爲牲畜瘟疫，一家農戶，以一絛耕中爲最大之財產，如死掉一條牛，眞此死掉一個兒子還傷心。湘分署曾組織牲畜治療隊，至各縣爲農人免費注射耕牛，起初他們還躊路不前，後來看見果然不罹疫，而且保證永遠不罹疫，便都爭先恐後請求注射，該隊原在郡陽防治牛瘟，現已分組二隊，在長沙，寗鄕，瀏陽一帶，防止豬瘟。</p>
<p>頃據分署統計，該署農業善救業務，有以下各項項目：（一）發給種子肥料，（二）辦理耕牛貸款，（三）發放農具，（四）防治獸疫，（五）修復永成垸及辦理曳引機訓練區等，永成垸爲機械示範農塲，墾田六萬畝，修復後可容一萬五千農戶分耕。</p>
<p>至於工業善後業務，有以下各項項目：（一）工商貸款，（二）貸放小本工業貸款，（三）發放小本經營貸款，（四）協助各工業廠商申請器材，（五）配售工業器村等。至於湘省受湘分署補助之醫護機構，共一百廿三單位。</p>
<p>今年辦理急振，湘分署係委託國際協濟會辦理，湘分署和聯總共負監督的責任。事實上，今年糧食來源不繼，它只就災荒最嚴重的衡山，湘鄕，茶陵，安仁，衡陽，（市縣）耒陽，郴縣，常寗，祁陽，邵陽，零陵，東安，道縣等十四縣市辦理急振，其餘報災者尙有十七縣，僅派員查報而已，所需糧粉，除湘分署提撥米與麵粉五千噸，罐頭五千噸外。湘省府配發，就各縣市積殼內發放米五千噸，共一萬五千噸。目下，各市縣待振災民人數，各照上年七月份災民數百分之廿估計，以爲本年應振人數，每人日給糧食半市。（二日，平）</p>

<p>〔本報梧州訊〕自廣西的陸川，博白等縣，以迄廣東的靈山，欽縣，防城，廉江，合浦，　遍及雷州一帶，兩廣人都籠統呼之爲「南路」。南路奸匪，以往皆在粵桂路邊境山林匿跡，在粵受學，北走入桂，在桂被剿，南下入粵，迤西則爲桂越，粵越　界，三不管的地段，最易使歹徒乘機作惡，再加以一部有組織能力的「說客」紛成入幕之賓，東拉西攏，因之構成一支半帶政治色彩半是野人作風的行伍，又加一些「得風氣之先」的靑年學生推波助瀾，處在這末一堆「有利條件」之下，粵桂邊開始迅速地深藏下千百顆毒瘤的種子，從而四百傾注，直使到人民深陷水火，卒至引起政府深切的注意。</p>
<p>新式武器大量配發</p>
<p>搜剿之下，匪徒往往迅即化整爲零，很像極守本分，各安生理樣子，官軍拿到一個不能亂殺，拿到兩個，也不能亂殺，看看沒有證據，又放回去。地方團隊實力尙見單薄，無論桂粵境內，匪徒挾聲勢以俱來之際，往往怯於匪勢，不敢進擊，以致釀成地方禍患，亦非無因，自從領略這末一個敎訓，當局已決定增强地方武力裝備，最近配發新式輕重武器一批，有衝鋒槍，火箭砲，輕重機槍，以及大量彈藥，如果說以如此兵力武器去對付一些無足輕重的毛匪毋寗說是政治上的意義遠重於軍事上的意義，今後的局面，似乎已經爲武力的增强而走向表面上的平穩，粵桂邊境重兵駐守—自陸川至盤龍，石角一帶，即駐有大批保安隊—數月來桂境內算得上平靜安謚，粵境匪徒雖然依舊橫行鄉間，然而猖獗之勢，近日來已稍歛跡，地方官爲求一勞永逸，莫不紛紛召開治安緊急會議，集全區縣地方紳耆，基層幹部，商討根本解決辦法，莫不認爲非以政治解決不足以從根消滅禍患。故此林英將軍亦曾有所指示，一方面念救淪陷之鄕村，速作復鄉遝動，一方面要嚴辦失職幹部。同時發動學生組織大規模宣傳隊，下鄕宣傳，實施感化政策。最近各地曾先後舉行剿匪宣傳大會。</p>
<p>女賊率部盤據山林</p>
<p>男有男「賊」同，女有女「賊」，桂南靈山迤西一帶，淞滬抗日名將張炎—已因「貽誤戎機」於卅三年在廣西玉林槍決—之妻鄭坤儀，就率領舊部二千餘人，盤踞山林，打家刦舍，「解放」老百姓的腰包，成爲中共在華南的一支死黨羽，新華日報譽之爲「女英雄」。算是動亂局面裏的一幕有趣插曲。</p>
<p>人民苦難無盡，災害侵襲着整個廣西的時候，這一片「廣西的穀倉」，亦不能免於洪潦的侵襲，廣闊的肥原上遍地是水，自鬱林以達梧州一帶，遭受的損失不可以數計，其中尤以岑溪，梧州兩地最爲慘重，附廓田疇，悉入水底，梧州地處珠江，桂江交合之地，洪水所至，竟至全城淹入水中，記者寄寓客旅高層，來往各地，竟要跑天橋作要子，直登北山，俯視全城，茫茫海市，眞使人有天何不憫之嘆！（三日）</p>

<p>陳述對日開放貿易意見　滬工業代表昨晉京　　呼籲原料分配權決定暫緩請願　　〔本報訊〕本市工業國體，爲政府決定開放對日貿易，推派代表胡柏翔，毛聖棟，田和卿，程守中，劉慶一等十餘人，於昨晚十一時專車晋京向當局陳述意見四點：（一）輸入之原料及機器，暫先以「修正進出口貿易暫行辦法」中所准進口者爲限。（二）商務考察團代表必須愼重產生，確定其職權，根絕爲私人謀利。（三）嚴防走私舞弊，加强緝私機構，由工商團體協助。（四）抉助國貨工廠，促其改進生產，以與外貨抗衡。　　又爲呼籲工業原料分配權，工業公會，工業協會原定同時晋京請願，惟昨日臨時因輸管會主任委員張嘉璈，挽市商會駱淸華請暫緩晋京，再行談判磋商，經各代表會議結果，決定暫緩三天晋京，在此三天中先與張主委接洽，如無甚結果，再行晋京。買戶觀望客帮不動　綿紗布一致挫落　四二支藍鳳紗續跌二十萬元　　昨日棉紗市况，塲上做開頗淸，外埠津粵籌帮納意依然鬆懈，惟織廠稍有進添，市勢仍形不振。結果四二支藍鳳紗價爲一千六百七十萬元，比上日續跌二十萬元。四十支藍鳳亦小二十萬，爲一千四百八十萬元。二十支特雙馬爲一千二百十萬，軋小二十萬元。輕雙馬跌十萬，爲一千零三十萬元。其餘天女金城人鐘十六支光明紅蜂海龍，及十支卅二支等粗細紗，亦均較上日步小二三十萬元不一。　　昨日棉布市况，初開以報載大批日本紗布經滬運銷南洋，並悉各地國棉收成頗佳，新花登塲期近，可使紗布成本减輕，塲內買戶成抱觀望，客銷亦無動靜，本街祗有零星胃口，而執貨者因成本關係，不願輕脫，市面一度擯持。詎近午收時，散戶吐售，斬殺頻起，塲上一片賣聲，喊價下潟，結果十二磅龍頭細布低至四十二萬三千元，比上日繼跌三千元。五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴等各細布，亦均續降一二千元至一萬五千元。其餘漂布粗布細斜及色布藍布等價，亦小二三千至五六千元不等。　　紡建售紗　　又訊：中國紡建公司昨循例開紗，共售各支紗一六八件，廠商申購單六十九張。因紗市疲軟，該公司掛牌價，以六支日光粗紗比上期低二十萬，爲五百七十萬元。卅二支三股八馬紗低七十萬，爲一千三百八十萬元。三十二支仙桃筒紗一千二百八十萬元，較議價小二十萬。四十支日光筒紗低十萬，爲一千四百五十萬元。四二支粟子小三十萬，掛一千四百七十萬元。六十支日光筒紗低三十萬，爲二千零二十萬元。六十支雙股栗子低五十萬，爲二千一百萬元。其他各支粗細紗，與上期相仿。　　又民營廠開紗，日前永紗開出金城牌各支紗約二百件，絲益開出金鷄牌各支紗約一百件。昨日安達開出卅二支飛虎牌約近百件，申新開出紅人鐘數十件，均遵議價開售。惟昨日市况下跌，若干紗號受買後，已無利可圖。　　現棉轉佳　　昨日現棉市况轉佳，紗布雖跌，但紗廠進意尙濃，惟限價收購，客戶不敷成本，交易大都中途擱淺。執貨者以新棉登塲，尙須兩月，在此靑黃不接之際，不願貶價脫手，故成交不旺。各檔做開送廠價靈費二二〇萬，二二三萬，棧交價靈寳一二一萬，二一一萬五千，二一二萬，一一三萬，鄭州細絨二二〇萬，漢細二一二萬，南太倉一七六萬，周浦籽花每組三二萬。　　又訊：中國紡建公司昨與本市棉花商成交國棉一批，共計三千二百餘包。成交價格，計經陽花二一五萬元，靈寳花二一四萬元，漢口細絨一九八萬元，沙市花二〇五萬元。　　美棉運滬　　又訊：順亨洋行斯的林凡爾號，前日由美抵滬，運來棉花六千零十餘件，鋼板鐵絲五百四十餘梱，汽油柴油火油計八千餘桶，滑潤油八百餘桶，墨灰一千一百餘袋。又　來公司華盛頓號郵船，由美　來木材二十三萬呎，金鋼鑽計二十箱，機器七十三件，係供廠局開礦用之器械。又油墨二十九噸，汽車五輛，救護車一輛，計八百餘噸。　　收購外棉　　〔又訊〕關於未獲輸入許可蹬之外棉，早經中央信託局奉命收購在案。茲悉：持有該項外棉之進口商，有請求中信局以棉易紗之說，以彌補彼等已付外匯之虧損。茲中信局爲此事已特派該局購料處副理張煦，晋京出席四聯總處會議，俾作最後之決定云。對配售人造絲事　中信局發表聲明　絲織業代表向市府請願　　〔本報訊〕中央信託局某負責人，昨爲該局配售人造絲事，有所聲明：　　（一）配售方式：尙係該局主管處人員力爭而得。按本局出售各項政府物資，向採拍賣或標售方式。今對人造絲仍保持配售方式，是對原配戶已予優先配受之權利，如並此項配售方式而仍有不滿，則本局勢將被迫而改以拍賣或標售方式出售。　　（二）配價問題：本局去年開始配人造絲時，配價本係按市機動調整。過去配價一度呆着未動，實係請示行政院調整絲價公文，往返費時，致一度歷久未變。後獲政院批示；由本局酌辦，乃開始調整。其調整方式，係由本局各主管處人員會商，按一週人造絲平均市價，並參照一週最後一日之市價，再予撞低百分之十，即作爲下週之配價。　　（三）各絲織廠聲稱：照現時配價購絲織造，各廠將因成本高漲，無法生產而閉歇。實則前數月本局因人造絲缺貨，而配貨一度中斷，亦未聞有絲織廠閉歇者，今有配絲而反使閉歇，此說不擊自破。至絲織廠對本局配貨貨款，須先一週繳納一點，如有未便，儘可提請改善本局無不樂於考慮接受云。　　又訊：絲織業代表昨赴市政府謁吳市長請願，昨日下午又在該業公會內舉行小組會議，呈文市政府申述目前廠商困難情形，要求合理减低配售價格，以利生產。必要時當赴南京請願，並決議自今日起，各廠均自動停止購買黑市人造絲，倘原斜吿絕，寗願全體被迫停工云。　　人絲市價上落徴細　　又訊：人造絲中信局配售單子已送交絲織業公會，惟因要求减低配價問題未解決，故未繳款。昨市價上落仍微，一二〇號高山及旭字等有光，上午價二千五百萬元，下午價二千五百二十萬元，比上日短二十萬元。　　廠經因實銷甚淡，昨市喊價稍疲。C字等級討價二千九百二十萬元，尙乏受主。高零担略有成交，價二千八百五十萬元。二十八分干經有單子貨喊價一千八百萬。綱貨亦疲，華强被面開市在一千〇四十五六萬元之問，收市價爲四十八萬元。大誠被面關市喊一千〇四十七八萬元，收市爲五十萬元即期價。格子　縐喊三萬四千元有人要，但無成交。　　社會局吳局長洽　商減低配價　　社會局吳局長爲人絲事前晚親赴國行張總裁私邸商洽，張總裁允予設法。昨晨中信局長吳任滄又與吳氏交換意見，吳氏希望中信局能體恤商艱减低配價，按照以前增價之比例，以上期配價每箱九百六十萬增加百分之五十爲限。吳任滄氏曾請社會局將絲織業之呈文轉交中信局，再行商洽定奪。　　據吳開先氏向記者表示：絲織業本身已在不景氣狀况之下，如政府欲使維持，應設法如何使减輕成本，此不但關係物價，亦且爲絲織工廠之生存問題，該項人造絲中信爲自日本運來，係獨行生意。每箱成本爲一百九十元美金，如加運費關稅及保險費以黑市結算，成本亦祗四五百萬元一箱。若依官價一萬二千元結算更賤，目前每箱配價欲二千三百六十萬元，實屬過鉅。社會局對工商界之苦痛不能不管，故希望中信局能减低配價，能不超過增加上期配價百分之五十。社會局對絲織業具呈之理由認爲有理，且可向中信局證明絲織業目前因成本高及產銷困難等關係，處境確爲慘澹，現今各廠已非賺錢多少之問題，而爲能吾生存問題。空方頻施壓力　華股交易寥落　　華股昨以掉期關係，放空者猖獗，永紗穩後仍吿屈服，交易見减，市容冷落，小型股尙形穩健，勤興不甘雌伏，昨忽異軍復起，驟呈反動，中途度次迫到漲停限度，人心稍受感應，過程即以此時爲最穩。終以新買不繼，臨收終遭空方所壓倒，信和遞交最後一天交易，市價每低於現交，形成倒掛。　　晨開榮辱不一，遞永紗開後，自二三九元起，經二三二號四號八五號二〇七號賣出，　面帮亦賣，低至二二二元。二二四號出後忽進，二一八號亦納現永紗，二二三號一六七號亦進，曾盤升至二二八元。七六號六五號八四號八三號六〇號仍賣，五〇號二二三號亦賣現永紗，退至二二四元左右而掙扎，形勢十分平庸。　　十時三刻後，勤興忽吿脫頴而出，一九三號一八八號力購，屢迫八〇元四角漲停限度，於是散戶人心稍受激動。永紗經一〇四號納現，一一六號二一八號進遞交，同時三六號亦力事補轉現永紗，曾回漲到二二八元。一四號二二四號二三二號二三五號七八號趁勢脫手，仍形屈伏。　　十一時三刻後，二二四號一六三號力售現永紗，而迫低至規遞都屬二一九元低價。新光於是際現遞倒掛，而信和亦然。良以信和遞交做至當日爲止，一四號二三號趁賤吸納現永紗，一五七號二四號補進遞交，午收遂以二三〇元及二二二元收市。　　收後一九〇號之猛供，遞永紗最後喊價低至二二〇元大關結果較前收即交股計永紗美亞華　新光永公微挫，中法景福微升，新華漲半成强，勤興好起成半，信和跌半成强，中紡內衣平平，大通中絲榮豐，火柴水泥微降，統益跌而景綸漲各計半成弱。遞交股計永紗美亞新光景福微挫，華豐信和各跌半成左右，塲外各老股頗形平和。　　大中華火柴實行增資，自八月十五日起暫停賣買。聯營各廠積極進行　拓展南洋市塲　正日夜趕製外銷棉織品　　據中國棉織業產銷聯營公司負責人稱：關於推銷南洋一帶製成品之原料供應問題，經該公司主持人向中國紡建公司接治結果，可於短期內陸續撥，深表慶幸。惟此時距離日本開放時間僅一週有餘，如所預定準備外銷出品不能如期啓運一批，則國貨棉織品必較日貨之抵達南洋落後一步，此中利弊不言可喩。現該公司所屬各廠純係民營工業，因受開放日本對外貿易問題之刺激，始創立聯營機構，乃我國工業界開始團結之徵象。現參加該公司之各廠商，雖原料與貨款之撥付較遲，然正日夜開工趕製，俾能在本月十五日前輸出一部份云。統債外股平定　　公債昨轉平庸，丙戊略升而雜牌均平，成交亦减少至四百萬左右。統丙晨開一〇三〇〇元，即由五五二室五五〇室進至一一〇〇〇元，五〇三室三六〇室有供，最後在一〇八〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙丁均平，統丙回升三〇〇元，統戊微升一〇。元。　　外股昨見穩健，除會德豐外均形平和，怡紗晨開雖會低至八四三〇〇元，證券帮有納，盤升至八七〇〇〇元而後轉定，洋行帮則出，結果與前收相較計紙業恰啤航萊電話均平，怡紗英聯鋼業業廣微升，會德豐獨見微挫。因投機倒閉　　〔合衆社香港六日電〕此間成和銀行（譯音）在國內外皆設有分行，已於六日晨倒閉，傳該行在投機中蝕去二百萬港幣，五日晚各董事會議，決定予以關閉，但六日官方對此事尙未加以評述。據經濟界訊：該銀行利用大量國外匯款，從事投機，以爲國幣幣値將銳降，但未能如願，致損失不貲（按該行係向英國註册）茶葉交易轉淡　　上月一度復甦之洋莊茶市，最近以來，又趨僵特狀態。揆厥原因。目前各出口商仍在積極趕辦運銷非洲　各哥之九百頓珍眉。對於任何花色咸取觀望。以言趨勢，因人心尙平，猶能維持不墜。至於內銷茶，本街及客帮續有染指，惟以胃納漸吿足够，致活動之意，不若隔日之興奮，交易亦轉遜落，惟過程則續吐秀氣。國行招待新聞界　報告貼放業務　七月底止核准貸款五六四億　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會，爲使外界明瞭該會最近工作情形，特於昨日下午四時，在該會會議室，招待新聞界，發表工作概况，各點如次：　　（一）貼放委員會自成立以來，貼放數字，逐月增進。而其對象有，亦逐漸普及於各類工業。截至七月卅一日止，申請案件計三百七十九件，金額一·一五三億餘元。其中核准申請貸款案三一八件，金額五六·四二百〇萬元。計廠商二九〇家，其中工廠二七二家，出口商十三家，及申做進出口中押匯廠商五家。以貸款方式言，計重貼現五八件二·七七〇百萬元，轉質押二五四件五〇·〇五〇百萬元，轉押匯六件三·六〇〇百萬元。以貸款性質言，計工業貸款二九九件四九·三一〇百萬元，出口物資貸款一三件三·五一〇元，押匯物資貸款六件三·六〇〇百萬元。以承貸行莊言，計省市銀行二家，商業銀行五五家，錢莊二八家，信託公司四家。　　（二）就過去核准貸款之約三百家工廠而言，此等廠商，有半數以上，以前從未在任何國家銀行獲得低利貸款，而在貼放委員會成立後，此種廠商，始獲得國家銀行低利貸款之資助。其次貼放會貸款之工廠，以屬於中小型工業佔最多數。因貼放會之放款額，頗能適應中小型工廠之需要。一旦獲得貸款，足以解除其資金週轉之困難，促進生產之效能。貼放會七月底以前所核放之五六四億餘貸款，其金額分配如下：（一）五千萬以下者九二件，佔總數百分之廿九。（二）五千萬以上一億以下者五八件，佔總件數百分之十六。（三）一億以上二億以下者八一件，佔總件數百分之廿六。（四）二億以上三億以下者四三件，佔總件數百分之十四。（五）三億以上四億以下者十五件，佔總件數百分之五。（六）四億以上五億以下者廿六件，佔總件數百分之九。（七）五億以上十億以下者三件，全爲進出口轉押匯，佔總件數百分之〇九。　　（三）截至七月底止，申請廠商，共計三百餘家。以上海七千餘家工廠而言，其比例當然太小，大多數均不免有向隅之感。推其原因，蓋因格於章則規定，廠商必須透過商業行莊，始能向貼放會申請貸款。遇商業行莊對於申請廠商之經營狀况，及其信用等方面不明瞭時，爲避免風險計，自難望樂予承轉。而另一主要原因，即爲貼放會成立未久，各廠商對於中央銀行貼放政策，及貸款手續，尙未盡明瞭。　　（四）審查貸款申請案件之標準，屬於工業貸款者，前經工業貸款審查會訂有審查工業貸款案件處理程序一種。現因出口物資貸款審查會，亦訂有處理程序，內容大體相同。爰將兩種合併爲「中央銀行貼放委員會審查工業出口物資貸款案件處理程序」，業經貼放會第十九次會議通過，俟奉准後即予施行。　　（五）貼放委員會自在上海方面自實行新辦法，三價餘月以來，對於本市工業，確能盡其協助之使命。而本市銀錢業，亦認爲辦法適當。至於上海以外之其他都市·鑒於上海貼放辦法之成效，甚望其能及早推廣，以應各地工商之急需，並已有當地銀錢公會商會工業同業公會等團體，正式來文商請設立貼放分會。此舉如確爲各地工商業所必需，中央銀行自　樂予考慮。惟以各地情形，與上海不盡相同，須先由本會蒐集各項有關材料，嚴密考慮，然後擬定計劃，呈奉張總裁核准後，　便舉辦。　　（六）關於貸款之事後稽核，依照奉准之稽核辦法，對於貸款廠商，由承貸行莊，負責經常稽核。而由中央銀行派員抽查其經常稽核報吿格式，昨已提出例會，即將印發各承貸行莊負責辦理。食米庚續下游　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧二千三百餘石，市况因消化呆而不動，　續下游。粳米步跌萬餘元，秈米再跌一二萬元，白元亦隨之挫落萬元。浦東新粳南北兩市共見一百五六十石，交易平淡，繼續挫跌三五千至萬元。　　麵粉零化納胃仍懈，形勢不振，修削千元。洋粉猛跌五六千元，妹皮疲中徘徊，微挫三五百元，市勢供多於求，仍趨軟化。豆餅逐步下降，盤低一二千元。黃豆陳貨去化略動，回疲二三千元，新豆來源漸涵，猛跌六七千元。紅糧存到兩稀，脚地頗堅，苞米北方動而不旺，漲定之格。　　菉豆去胃仍淡，少神乏交，中次回小三五千元。莞豆汕頭續進，市勢挺硬，蠶豆客帮續取堅穩之狀，赤豆貨少銷活，價格上漲六七千元。芝蔴洋莊本街均無納胃，供者尙多，求者寥寥，成交極微，暴跌一二萬元。生仁華南猛吸，異常俏利，節節高翔，形成直綫上升，飛騰一二萬元，迫近六十大關。　　油市廣方進胃轉懈，零化不爽，生油初堅後回，軋低萬元，豆油平平，菜油疲乏，淸油平席，蔴油鮮有變動。紡調議價小組　定今日開會　　〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會，將於今日下午四時，再度舉行會議，俾參照市況，重訂合理議價。大衣呢看好　　呢羢零躉交易，近受炎暑影響，靑黃不接，門市寥落。標準行情，因此悉見平穩，無甚大上落。各種貨品銷路，首推大衣呢類最佔優勢，因其產存頗缺，香港方面絕少運到，中紡開價每週扒高，賣買雙方手貨空乏，人心因多堅固看好。</p>

<p>社會服務讀者諮詢　　法律釋疑　　宗法社會一子兼祧　修譜正名幾涉訴訟　新人物玩的舊把戲　　編輯先生：我是一個沒有母親的女孩子。現在一個敎會大學念書，一面做事，半工半讀。爸爸是留美學生，媽媽是醫學博士。他倆於民國十一年在香港結婚。　　大公公和公公只有一個兒子，那便是爸爸，爸爸是一子兩祧，在爸爸媽媽結婚以前，爸爸並沒把這情形吿訴媽。只說是沒有給婚，這樣欺騙媽媽，不過給婚證書上主婚人却寫大公公的名字（本來大公公是爸爸的伯伯），那媽便是大公公的媳婦，結婚後爸才告訴媽。說他家中還有妻子兒女，母親聽了氣憤不己，當時便要離婚，但因那時思想很封建，離婚的事不當見，不能不顧到輿論，旣是一子兩祧，也是正室，與名譽並無損失，也就算了。　　民國廿五年我們在南京家中要修譜，母親因而趕回九江，譜當然是照「一子兩祧」修了。第二年抗戰開始，我們又　九江，上廬山，那冒媽發現譜有兩種，另一種是把她立在黃姆媽（爸的另一妻子）名下爲妾，母親身體虛弱，極度的刺激後，患了肺病，在廬山療養院醫治，戰爭時我們東奔西逃家諧的事置於一旁。　　媽的病勢日益沉重，在廿八年夏天，拋下我們去了，　　抗戰雖已勝利家人還是分散外邊，今天突然接到胞妹的信，吿訴我堂姊來信給爸爸，談及修　的事，說一定要把姆媽立在實姆媽名下。吾則將以法律解决云云。爸爸看了信，非常生氣，我們的意思是這樣的，媽如要立在他人名下爲妾，則決不上諧。爸爸年紀大了，我們當然也不願他受任何法律上的制裁。現在有幾個問題請你解答。　　（一）媽媽在譜上能否算大公公的媳婦而是正室？（二）如果媽媽弟弟不上譜，我們能否要父親貼出生活費及給予一部份產？（三）如果他們强要把媽媽弟弟依他們的意思上譜，我們可否控訴？（四）媽媽自己買的田地，契約是否可交給我們？（現由爸爸保管着）　敬請撰安　藍霓敬上　　藍霓鑒；來信所述，對於你媽媽的處境我們表示非常同情。你的爸爸在封建的宗法社會制度下，爲了「一子兼祧」，而同時娶了兩個妻子，這不是他本人的罪惡，這是一種不良制度造成的惡果，如果在今日的法律制度下，也許就不會造成這種悲劇。你所提的問題，我們已請本欄法律顧問朱亞揆律師爲你解答，現在把它照錄如後：（一）宗祧繼承業已廢止似非法律所許。（二）上譜與否非法律上之必要條件，即非婚生子經認領後亦得與婚生子享受同等權利。（三）家庭糾紛萬勿各走極端，即令控訴勝訴亦未必能操左券。（四）可。光華診所施診　　李琛韓斌兩醫師合組之光華診所，地址在公平路五八〇號，專治內外各科，該區民衆，都勞動階級，生活艱苦，兩醫師慈悲爲懷，暑期施診，掛號只收一千元，藥費祗收成本，病家嘖嘖稱謝，診務日見發達。訪人生出版社　　本報雲南　江縣讀者王宇彥君來函，查詢重慶人生出版社遷滬後之地址，因該社未加入同業公會，一時未能查悉，如出版界諸君有知該社地址者，希即示知爲幸！</p>

<p>出版界周刋遐菴彙稿  陸丹林　　（遐遐菴稿年譜再版印行會編印。上下兩册。非賣品。）　　遐菴彙稿，是葉遐菴（恭綽）先生的門生故吏為葉氏所編印的專集，前後共出版三次：第一次為葉氏五十壽辰時所出版的。屬第一輯，綫裝四冊。第二次為葉氏去年六十六壽辰時所出版，屬第二輯，洋裝一冊。第三次，為今年出版，洋裝兩册。共內容，第一輯是由葉氏十五歲起至五十歲的文稿，第二輯是由第一輯未發刋之稿而至六十六歲止，而十之九文稿，是從五十一歲至六十六歲爲止。第三次印行的，却將第一二兩輯全部稿件，分別部居，彙合而成。其中尙有小部分在第二輯出版之後的新作品，或是以前遺漏的文稿，也盡量的收入，以前一二兩輯閒有昏漏的字句，也詳關的修訂，可以說是最完善的本子了。　　葉氏自廿六歲起，即參與中國交通事業，始自末僚，終參大政，民九·十一·十四，三任交通總長，民十三任廣州大本營財政部長，民廿一任國民政府鐵道部長，前後主特交通四政三十多年，直接的間接的，都爲中國數十年來交通大計，有最密切之關聯。彙稿內容，分爲三編，一公牘，包含葉氏執政的時候，閣議提案，各項會議提案，計劃草案，以及街司署　奏咨照會呈函電令條陳等，悉入此編。其中案牘十之八九，屬葉氏手稿，間有由僚屬屬草，經他改定後發布的。二詩文，包含詩詞雜詠，和論文序跋記述書啓哀祭墓碣銘贊雜文等。三演講，其中演講訓詞，或屬自撰，或屬門生從僚的筆記或社團的記錄，包括交通四政和學術文化的演講。第一二兩輯和第三版彙刋，都是如此的分類，體例是一律的。　　葉氏在中國的政治。文化各方面，幹了四十多年的大事，建設了偉大的功績，奠定了中國交通的基礎，他的立身行事，治學修養，必有和普通的人相異的，後他的「四十年求知的經過」，便可以知道一般，他說：　　「我知道我的思想行爲，頗有幾個特點。第一，是矛盾而相容的，平常人的個性，往往偏於一方，如歡喜靜的就不歡喜動，歡喜圓融的就不臺歡拘執，講事功的就不談哲理，躭藝術的就忽略實務，這是大抵皆然的。不過我却不然。我一方面在討論工業上技術問題，同時却可以談談宗敎哲學，一方面研究一個公司要怎樣組織，同時又會想到音樂書畫上的問題，而且，似乎不會混亂與偏頗。所以老友　鶴亭常說葉某的腦子大概像一個貨倉，把各種貨物分類的存儲，要用時一樣一樣的取出。第二，是實際而超脫的，平常人於所專注的事情，每教而不舍，反之，則一切管不認眞。我對於一切的事情來到面前，從來沒有忽略過絲毫，但從來沒有執滯過絲毫，祇是盡心竭力去做，到不得已的時候，我却會全織創捨拋棄，一無留戀，這大概多少有點道德哲學上的修養之故。……」　　看他這　的　　的自白，比之旁　的魚　描寫，自然來得深刻和實　的了。　　茅以昇所寫的序文有說：「　哥書是選　先生事功的寫照，但是將來歷史上留名的，是他的事功呢？還是他的文章呢？這部　博大精微，深入淺出，一般人護完了的感想，是仰慕作者的成就，畢生效法，還是徒賞奇文，付諸一歎呢？中國前途的命運，恐怕就是一個試騐吧！」我們知道茅氏的這番話，意在言外，實在是「慨乎言之」的。在此世界戰爭結束之後，我國正在努力經濟建設之時，而使一位素有經綸抱負建設極有勛績的國之天老，任他伏處一隅，不能不說是建國進程中的一件遺憾的事！雖然近十餘年的一切設施，早在他的計中劃，門生故吏，多能够繼續他的事工。爲了道，更加使人在仰慕中而有無限的寄意。那麼，這一部遐菴彙稿，當然不只是奇文共賞、而是經濟建國的圭果的了。中國地方行政制度  孟琨　　羅志淵著　獨立出版社印行　　在實騐政治學的行政學諸部門中，行政制度是一較重要的對象，而地方行政，不問以省或縣爲單位，總之是國家行政措施的基礎；因此，地方行政制度的研究，或對於負實際責任的官吏，或對於進入了民主時代的百姓，都成了不可缺少的常議。　　中國要實行憲政了。在實行憲政的當兒，多少要注意到地方分地使地方政治冊成為中央政治的底層，如何才冊完全地發揮地方自治所於國於民的功利，都是目前急切需要討論的問題。以往，這方面的書不是沒有，但太少了，但太簡單或抽象了，很難舉出一種可以供最近期一般專家及平民參考瀏覽的。這一冊「中國地方行政制度」是比較不能算壞的一本書，至少已談到現行的地方制，雖然還不够追上這回憲法頒布後所對於地方政制的檢討。沒有更新的更詳的書來塡補此一亟須的空隙，那麼這書是有其該被注意和被推荐的價値的，推荐給無數國民們。　　題目是「中國地方行政制度」，似乎是叙述的，可是也批評地提供了不少理論上的精華，即使不够詳備，但祗少已駕乎一般專摘法令和加些按語而成的行政手册之上。牠是一册介紹的，報吿的書，歷史地，並且新聞地給我們看到關於「中國地方行政制度」諸角隅的種切。　　上中下三篇約各占百頁左右，平均地從傳統，學理，和現狀的三不同的視野來解釋和研究。　　上篇「地方政制的史的發展」，從中國自有一統以來，自有地方制度以來，一直述到封建末年的淸代的各時代所實行過的地方政制。共八章，每一章劃分着一段朝代的史跡。每一章與另一章之間有着連遞的對照和指出其演變的步驟，這是讀史者所應有的方法及態度。同是郡縣制，秦代的和南北朝的當然有異；同是州縣制，唐代的和元代的亦自歧紛。尤其可以提出的是在討論某一時代的地方行政制度時，不僅論其直接與中央有關的各層地方制，甚至於也未忽略掉再低細的自治單位，如在秦，元，明的各童裏，都另有一節關於當時「鄕制」的檢討。再則，每一時代的地方政制，作者能抽擇出他的特點。　　第九章「中央地方權限的劃分」和第十章「省縣行政區域問題」合爲中篇，總題是「地方行政之權限問題」。這二章是偏於理論的部分。作者在前一章內，先駁斥掉集權和分獲的各家學說，然後肯定均權的合於科學法則性；詮釋了「地方」的意義，舉出「存省論」及「廢省論」的諸人議論，並批評　方的得失；專檢討現行法令中的權限劃分，列釁各治權的隸屬；結論是說在演變中，一切當視客觀的需求而定。後一章的主要重心在於地理的人爲分割，其實也是　限問題，與上一章所不同者，是從縱的移轉到橫的而已；跟着淪省區的縮小，隨即批判掉聯省自治的疵瑕；登後講現行政區域的整理，使不合理的現狀如何改變得有效率，這一篇的參考徴引及統計材料均極富　。　　最末的七八萬言，　是「現行地方行政制度」的叙述。作者並無創見，祗是用巧妙的手法來一序序地分析着，從省到行政督察專員，從行政督察專員到縣，另外一章是市。每一層制度的淵源，演進，都有並不枯燥的叙說；每一組織的具體特徴，也都經濟不漏地介紹出來；再論到每一制度的弊點和作者所試擬的補救辦法，或甚至於存廢及改良的路綫和決策。作者在下篇裏徵引的資料到新縣制爲止，所以缺去不少新法令，但這是可補訂的。　　綜觀本書，有優點，也有缺點。優點是淸晰，明朋，而有系統，使得讀者在過目後，可有一　狀留在腦際。若是需要作進一步的學習，那麼只須注意到本書的各小節目，也可算是能得到無數的行政知識。　　缺點方面，　不打斷，可是應有較詳的批評。這些缺點，議屬於形式，或屬於內容，都是可能補正的，在形式上言：本書的編排次序未能視爲怎樣合理，最適宜的方法也許是把全部理論及學說的部分，搬到最前去，成爲一專章，以便給讀者在最先的關讀中可以得調一關於理論的認識；同時批評的地方還太少，作者未曾充分地發揮他主觀的見解，而純是姑在旁觀的立塲；再則，作者理論方面的疏忽，使他無暇將外國的行政制度穿插進來，即在對中國古代的地方行政制度的介紹中，也似乎有些機械，這使得一本書的資料性超過了他的立說；此外，本書雖然够活潑，可是爲格式所限，處處不可免地引用了太多的法令和條例。在內容上言：作者在構論現行地方制的時候，對於縣以下的區鎭鄕村，甚至於保甲的各基層都未詳細地申說，這怕是本書的最大憾事；另外本書雖說是地方行政制度，但顯著地，這裏所謂的行政是一般的，所以該兼論到地方的立法機構和司法機構，不過作者沒有注意。　　但雖如此，在出版界缺乏着可以代替的書時，本書仍有其特獨的價値；至少，牠可以使你能對於你所身處有關的地方行政制度，能有一較够應用的常識。英文演說文範  晴巒　　方樂天著　商務印書館出版　　研究文學的人，文思和筆調，每苦不能暢達，研究西文的人，更多有這種感覺。縱使他和西人談話，能應對如流，但敎他作長篇而有組織的演說來，那就往往有拮據艱澀的苦悶。這原因是在學校所讀的文學書，大半偏重故事，小說，戲劇一類，至於議論辯駁的文字，尤其適合於演說用的，實在太少。學校裏是這樣，書坊間當然也是這樣。我們走到坊間去尋幾部西文演說文字的書，是很不容易的。要想尋一本適合中國，適合現在的中國，適合我們今天研究用英文演說的書，那就更難找到了。　　商務印書館出版方樂天著的英交演說文範，確是解決這種困難的一本好書。這書的內容，就中國各方面現實的情形，用作者本身的感想，來發揮，假設種各機會和境地，作爲演說的標題。內容就文章作法，分爲叙事，描寫，議論，說明四大類，共二十四篇。說明類有海陸空軍，雷遠，原子彈，國防，的意義，鐵路交通，森林福利，社會敎育，個人與社會，中國與戰後世界之善後，研究英文的方法，英語演說的技術等，均闡明盡致，有條不紊。議論類有抗戰必勝，中國外交，華僑任務，吏治民生，和出版界的責任，均獨具見解，妮妮動人。叙事類有同事多年的話別，作者生平的小史，惡劣環境的生活，均能一綫相承，又如潯陽琵琶，淸凄婉轉。描寫類有海陸空大戰的回憶，理想的家庭，西湖的風光，均能繪形繪聲，歷歷如畫，使讀者如置身其地。　　全書文筆，極簡潔明朗，流暢生動，更能就各篇之性質及體例，亦陽剛，亦陰柔，亦雄健，亦細試，作研究演說的參考書可，作茶餘酒後的消遺品亦可。巒閱讀一過，覺其彌有興趣，故樂爲介紹，以公同好。本書各篇之後，均附有作法，極合學者研究之用。代郵　　李雪中，祺，　傳文，魯元，顧文彬五先生請即示通信地址爲荷。編後語  統先　　近來編者特別與奮，外來的稿子越來越多，水準越來越高了。「出版界」的園地向極公開的，大部分的投稿者和編者都不熟悉的，地們能從北平，濟南，杭州，南京……　稿子給我們。當然有時我們也特約專家的稿子，不過我門的態度是客觀的。我們還需要讀者多多的指示我們，你們想讀那一類的書籍和雜誌，我們總盡力介紹的。　　由於稿子的擁擠，於是我們選擇的標準比較高。所以謂選擇的標準一是被評介的書籍雜誌本身的價値；二是評介本身文字思想的優美；三是批評的客觀性和建設性。這樣一來，有一部分可愛的投稿者們必會感覺到失望。但是學問和寫作都是可以進步，我們不妨再接再厲。我們是尊重先進，鼓勵後進的。不過讀者和投稿者注意，本刋的範圍希望是多方面，關於科學者述（無論是通俗的或專門的）和社會理論的書籍，我們請多投稿。　　最後還得聲明一點，許多稿子我們想用的，一時限於篇幅，短期不能登出，可是我們希望投稿諸君稍爲耐心一點，因爲實在想留待後用而不願割愛退回的。這得請諸位原諒。讀「索特」  石碚　　（列昂諾夫著·董秋斯譯·新知雷店　）　　俄國自一九一七年大革命後，即接連在內亂和被協約國的封鎖中，使俄國文壇呈現荒凉悽落的景象，作家們流散在世界各地，一班靑年作家多傾向在浪漫故事的寫述。然經過了幾年，新經濟政策（允許個人自由經商）和五年計劃實行後，文壞上一時的低潮，復得蓬勃奮發起來，這時作家們的筆鋒轉向日常生活和個人心理的寫作。列昂諾夫便是這一轉變時期中的新起作家，　　列昂諾夫生於一八九九年，他發表處女作以民間故事爲題材的短篇「布爾依卞」時才是二十三歲的靑年，後來接着發表一些短篇。作品中充滿非凡的天分，文質渾然，技巧純靑，使他享有崇高的地位。一九三〇年發表了這一部長篇小說「索特」後，更鞏固了他的第一流作家的聲望。　　索特是蘇聯北部一處偏僻蠻荒的地方，這本小說的定名和所攝取的背景就是這一個地區。在那裏有急湍的河流，有蔽天的森林，有鳥鳴與自然的天籟相和應，也有寂寞閉塞的修道院，院裏的僧人和當地的富　，便成了這地方的統治集團，管轄那些愚昧的和保持有原始迷信的居民。在這時新的力量到來了，技術人員和工程師如烏伐捷夫，伐伏洛夫，波帖木金，蘇珊妮……都來了。他們像新的人類要用炸彈一般猛烈的力量根除紫特的古老的平靜。他們要建設大規模的造紙廠，採伐森林，疏濬河道；馬達機聲軋軋不竭，將這藍空下的一角永久停滯的死寂氣氛劃破了。但是這一批新的生力軍，受到舊有頑固者險惡的破壞，直至全書完結，新舊的鬥爭還沒有結束。不過，所有參加艱巨建設工程的人員，他們已經知道素特的面貌正在改變，而且連那些一向被壓抑和蒙騙的居民也在改變了。　　　　開始在第一章裏，鳥伐捷夫對新的工作便有了這　的幻想：「沿着素特單調的水面，發出漂浮的木料的動亂聲和嘈雜聲，相隔不遠，一座一座的工廠建築物，像畸形的結晶體一般閃光；在那裏，在整個龐大的黑色卵形物中，在平息下來的狂亂寂靜中，纖維質綏緩地產生出來……」這是寫得多美麗多具體的　景。當我們慢慢地讀完這本書時，我們會相信烏伐捷夫的幻想，不是一個飄渺的夢，而是眞正能够到來的事實，是五年計劃用血和爲所交織造下的成績。　　列昂諾夫所寫下的，沒有利用羅曼斯的小說綫索，作爲全書故事的引導，更沒有離奇舖張的情節。但是我們讀起來，並不覺得過於枯燥乏味，我們看到昂諾夫運用複雜技巧的寫作方法，他在純熟而淸新的詩意的表現間，能和淳樸的農民的對話語法，取得可驚的調和，表現得明晰而官有生氣。這都是新穎　滿有力的風格，是最値得我們學習的。高爾基曾經隆重熱情地推　這本書，關於列昂諾夫寫作的風格，高爾基說；「假如我們說托爾斯泰『用鐵來鑄造他的書』，屠格湼夫「用銀和銅來鑄造」，那末列昂諾夫應當被看作用很複雜的合金來鑄造了。在他的景物描寫中，時常含有特由切未的『天然抒情詩』的意味；在他的人物的　畫上，我們可以覺出　義托夫的散文的嚴峻的正確性。」逍也是說明了列昂諾夫獨特的地方。　　這本書，有曹靖華先生從俄文　譯過來譯本名「侵略」，董秋斯先　譯的是照莽大古和諾爾班道夫兩人的英譯本譯出的。在我國文壇的創作中，我們還沒有讀過類似「索特」的作品。讀了這本書，使人更盼望着我國復興建設的工作，能够早日實現，使荒蕪苦悶的文搜，留下此「素特」更偉大的作品！滬濱絮語陸地行舟  十郎　　這兩天，淫暑連天以後，又遭到在風暴雨，氣象台又在報吿，第二次颱風又將來了。　　不管颱風來不來，但大雨傾盆，上海馬路上又在「陸地行舟」了。　　南京路，霞飛路一帶，水都有尺把深，如若上海可以地美維納斯，到也未嘗不可，但是大水浪浪，對於一般市民，實在不方便。　　陸地行舟—只是一個風雅的名詞，我們幷不希望有；我們只希望上海市能够把溝渠的積水，用量科學的方法疏通出去；用最快的方法，使積水不數留在馬路上。　　自然，這也許要章涉到許多問題，比如馬路本身太低；上海市民不愛　溝渠，垃圾雜物，汚　孔道，致大雨如注時，積水一時無法出淸。　　但是，這是管理與技術上的問題，勝利二年以來，每逢大雨，上海還是一片「陸地行舟」的風景畫！　　希望市政當局，能够用最快的速度，改善這一景象。因為天氣煉然，溝水倒灌，於衛生淸潔都大有妨碍。　　尤其是國際觀瞻所在的一個東方的大都市，連溝渠都未能管理完善，使那些洋人們又在翹着鼻子嘆息，我們聽了，也不能不紅臉呵！自由談「專員」蔣經國  路珊　　蔣經國—現在正在嘉興，任一千數百人的夏令營的營主任。　　他在贛南的幾年「專員」，對於他政治生活的磨練，是有着非常大的影響的。　　他在贛南時，老百姓都叫他「專員」，靑年團的幹部，則喊他「主任」。　　他任「專員」時，自己經常下鄕，和鄕里父老作娓娓淸談；他也和孤苦兒童的小學生，嬉皮笑臉的踢小皮球；他也會赤着膊，參加贛州「不夜天」的羣衆火炬遊行；在專員公署，他親自接見「老百姓」。　　我所以說這些，說明蔣經國明顯地想打破兩點：（一）撕碎官僚作風；（二）探索民隱，以作政治上的明鏡。　　過去有人傳說老百姓有喊他「蔣靑天」的，亦即爲此。　　就因爲如此，蔣經國便多少帶着點「傳奇」的色彩。　　比如他禁止他下屬的賭博，犯禁的，不論男女，罰他敲石子，遊街，跪中正公園。當時有一位秘書夫人，犯了禁，照樣脆公園，奄不徇情。　　有人說他化裝出巡，其實不一定有；但他親自率警捉烟查賭，自然是可能的。　　常他初到贛南的時候，他所遭遇到的困難，恐怕任何一個官吏，都會望而却步。　　但他站在贛南，始終矻然不動，他和惡勢力奮鬥，他和有限的專署經費奮鬥。尤其是他手創的許多公店公賣的制度，公營自給的辦法，很可以作爲全國行政機構效法。　　公家發售配給米，配給油，鹽，使奸商無從操縱，使物價更形穩定；這種公營制度，官家自然有利可圖，但是「取之於民，用之於民，」他拿那些錢來辦公，辦學校，辦報紙，經營工廠收容孤苦兒童，創立理想的「兒童新村」—，這一條綫路下來，確立了新贛南新政治的搖籃，的確也並非偶然的。　　我們並不是過作譽詞，但蔣經國本身確也不少「出人頭地」的地方。比如他不貪汚，你能否認麼！他有血氣，你能說不壓！他肯和老百姓接近，一般官吏做得到麼！　　靑年人對他，更具信心。　　他直率，坦白，他有他的革命奮鬥的理論，他也肯和靑年打成一片。本來，他本身也只是個中年，他當然深知靑年人的思索與苦悶。　　他在蘇聯很久，他的豪邁，爽朋的作風，有人說他是受了蘇聯的影響。比如美記者愛金生訪問贛南時，就曾經問到過這一點　　其實，蔣經國以蘇聯的「大刀闊斧」爲底子，却以「謹愼小心」贛南多年的政治經騐，作爲他今後政治生活的考騐；對於他，是只有增加多少魄力，多少剛强，與多少深思與冥想的。水滸駢枝太尉  愛竹　　水滸傳裏邊有三個太尉，最顯赫的自然是殿帥府掌兵太尉高俅，另外兩個是效走妖魔的洪太尉和奉旨進香的宿太尉，從秦漢以來太尉一向是中央最高長官三公之一，從唐以後活太尉是很少見的，大抵都是死後的追封。宋徽宗官爵儘管濫，也不得同時有三個太尉。其實他們三個都不是貨眞價實的太尉，這是宋朝對於高級武官的一種尊種或者俗稱。南宋時有一位文官加了武職，人家就稱太尉，他大不高興，同時却也有以此自喜的。　　高俅的實官只是殿前司。馬步軍都指揮使。這個殿前司是滄州橫海郡柴大官人的祖宗柴世宗設立的，在當時是集合中央與地方最精銳部隊所組成，仗着這枝殿前軍柴世宗立了好多戰功。這枝軍隊由皇帝親自帶頷，所以沒有大將，最高級的將領稱爲都點檢。後來趙匡胤憑了都點檢的地位，受軍士擁護，做了皇帝，就把這一個官裁掉，所以在宋朝殿前司的組織截去了頭，都指揮使倒變成了最高長官。　　殿帥府黨兵太尉統領八十萬蔡軍，這個數目倒也不是　空揑造。宋朝禁兵頂多的時期有一百二十餘萬，徽宗時還有八十餘萬，可是吃空額，開小差之餘，等到金兵圍城實際上只有數萬禁軍而已。並且據說有些兵士上了馬就發抖，兩手拉着繮繩不敢放，連兵器都合手不住。高俅常都指揮使的時期相常久，此時雖已卸任，對於禁軍的腐敗多少也應負一點責任。不過積習相沿已久，仁宗時候就公開准許每營吃空額若干名，而且那些兵士領了餉米也久已拿不動而雇人代背了。統領禁軍的除了殿前司之外還有侍衛司，所以要附帶說明，這個八十萬的數目應該有半數屬於另一個機關，　　水滸傳的寫成固然較晚，但是所根據的傳說却由來已久，所以大體上和當時背景相合，不像蕩寇志胡亂把淸朝的官制牽合，還認眞把高俅當作了太尉。旅美什錦  徐菽園　　西瓜加鹽，美國風味　　美國人有許多古怪作風，在我們看來有些反常，但他們却自以爲別饒風味，最普通的機件事，就是他們吃西瓜時，將西瓜擱在冰箱裏凉過，切成片片，抓起　罐，把鹽往西瓜上灑，西瓜向來是甜的，加了鹽便變成鹽瓜，改甜而又鹽，怪難吃的，但美國人却吃得津津有味。更有人喜　加胡椒末的，又甜又鹽又辣，如果再加一匙酸甜，便甜酸苦辣（鹽有苦味）四味皆備了。他們吃金瓜（即香瓜Cantaloup，蜜露瓜Honey　Dew）也要加　加　椒，我們覺得瓜不够甜時，有加白糖或菓子汁的必要，却未聞有用鹽巴及胡椒的，可是要沾染一些美國作風，就得大啖椒鹽西瓜，如果上海有餐館特設椒鹽西瓜，而榜其玻璃窗日：「美國食品」，定可大廣招徠，引致一班摩登仕女。再一種作風便喝茶加糖，而咖啡不加糖，美國喝的咖啡，都是像　汕般濃黑，苦不堪言，比吃中國葉還苦十倍，加了糖已不容易喝下去，不加糖如何可以下嚥，而眞正喝咖啡者決不加糖，有些咖啡店化五分錢買一大盃咖啡，喝完之後，照例可以再冲一盃，謂之Refill，這一盃是免費的，因爲吃卿啡的目的，在乎過癮，沒有過癮，理應再喝，至興盡意滿而之，喝牛奶是不應當放糖的，牛奶原帶有甜味，旣不難下嚥，有何理由再浪費白糖，所以你在任何餐館進膳，你呌咖啡時，他們可能給你一小紙碟糖（約一英直徑），但呌牛奶時他們絕對不給你糖，如何你使用桌上的糖罐，也未嘗不可，但終覺過於浪費物資，給旁桌食客看了，不免投來驚奇的眼色。麵包上已加牛油，便不應再用果　，有些餐館不把牛油包括在餐費內，每小塊牛油另收美金一角，果醬亦然，因此曾引起一部分顧客的反對，認爲大為小家氣，但牛油也曾受過物價統制局的統制，爲什麼不可以算錢，在餐館方面並未濫收。美國牛油很少有眞的，多半用的是人造牛油，有牛油氣而無牛油味，像人造猪油一樣，毫無油質，燒一樣蔬菜，用四兩猪油還吃不出油味，美國買不到荳油或蔴油，所以祇可用人造猪油，我喜歡用牛油燒菜，比較有香味，然過的猪油另外盛放着，積成大量，獻給政府，可以用來製造炸藥，製造炸藥一定要用熬過的猪油向民間微集，最爲經濟方便，廢物利用，在人民方面毫無損失之可言，眞是拔一毛而利天下者也。（三七）喜團圓  胡盧　　獄裏漢奸准吃西瓜—見本市新聞。　　甘心賣國，全成冷血，沒有靈魂！雖然天氣交關熱，熱不進牢門！　　冰甎被拒，西瓜准吃，喜煞奸羣—可能「假釋」，團圓預兆，返見親人？　　註：漢奸罪刑合於刑法「假釋」規定二者，可予保釋，曾載本報。紀念華亭（上）  因　　—殉難報人介紹之一　　民國二十三年冬，聖誕節前兩天，琅玕，華亭，和我三人，去徐家匯訪問馬相伯老人。一路上寒風蕭索，落葉飄零；除了朋友問的溫情外，四週的環境了無暖意。經過了雙塔尖高矗着的大禮拜堂，迂邇曲折地，便到達相老人所居的土山灣一角小樓上。　　正和冬夭的太陽一般可愛，相老人誠摯而和靄地給我們談了許多話。他對於日本軍閥在東三省和上海發動的陰謀侵略，非當債懣。他老人家瞧不起那些島夷，說道，他們可用三個「無」字來形容：「男無信義，女無康取，花無香氣。」　　華亭對於時事的分析，瞭如指掌，而且又長辭令，他和相老人談得格外投契。本來相老年紀雖大，却極風趣，談笑中富有幽默感，當我們進門之初，各自通姓報名，相老人注視着華亭的名片，又朝着他臉上端詳了一會，呵呵地笑着說道：「…金華…是地名…，華…華亭…也是地名…」大家一陣笑聲。　　這一年，相老人的高齡已是九十五歲，而我們三個小伙子的年齡，合加起來還差着他一歲呢。華亭爲老人攝影，他從各種不同的角度或　或蹲，忽遠忽近，只聽得幾聲「克勒…克勒」的響，已把這一位從同治十一年創刋號申報讀起，六十多年來從未間斷的本報眞正老讀者，攝入了他的「籠」—當日同事喜呼他那隻方型的反光照相機爲烏籠—中了。臨走前十多分鐘，我們又叩問相老人攝生和長壽的方法，華亭表示着極大的興趣，他還特別提出了幾個人生問題，然後道別。　　華亭在十三年前，爲馬相伯先生所攝的像片，至今還很究整的保藏在本報資料室中。而他本人呢，在我國神聖的抗戰過程中，民國三十年二月三百，完成了人生最偉大，最崇高，最寳貴的任務；以生命貢獻於國家，爲新聞事業而捐軀；世界上任何東西可以數目字來估計，惟有華亭的犧性是沒有價値可以代表的。　　華亭給奸僞狙擊，殺身成仁，其死也爲千古盛事，浩氣長存。從肉體上講，他以四十歲的英年，中道翰　，在我們朋友中間，在私人的情感方面，總覺得他死事慘烈，爲之痛惜不已。但是就他本人來講，他在天地正氣之中，已完成了一環，完成了我們報人的正氣之一環。他上無愧於父母，下無作於妻孥，正是我們做朋友的可以爲他驕傲的地方。古人以德參天地爲人間最綿長的壽微。華亭雖死猶生，還有什麼遺憾呢！　　就職業立塲講，他才學兼優，　識過人，眞是一個標準的優秀外勤記者，待人接物，熟情奔放，總給人家一個極好的印象；及至相處旣久，他對任何朋友，無不披肝瀝胆，相見以誠，他捨生取義的精神，從這些地方，已能體會得到。　　華亭天生聰明，旣善於了解別人的心理，更能表現自己的長處；他對於任何事物，能吸收，能融會，而更能利用。</p>

By evening, the vanguard had crossed Xiajiazhuang and Xiaoying, approaching the east bank of the Zi River. Another route, from Linqu and Jiangyu, pursued the National Army southeast, also reaching the vicinity of Daguan on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The highway from Jining via Wenshang, Dongping, and Dong'a to Jinan was reopened on the 5th, with the remaining bandits retreating to the west bank of the Grand Canal. Furthermore, the highway between Jinan and Yanzhou is now open, and there are no traces of bandits in the triangular area between the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Yellow River, and the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] With the recovery of Yidu, the Communist bandits' resistance was not fierce. Many believe this symbolizes the depletion of their forces. The National Army now finds itself in an increasingly advantageous position in the central Shandong war situation. The National Army is dividing its forces to suppress bandits towards Zibo and Boshan. Battles are unfolding from the outskirts of Boshan to Tusikou. The equipment and families of the Zibo bandit army are being evacuated to Huantai, indicating a wavering and preparations for a northward retreat. It is expected that the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway can be reopened sooner than expected.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] After defeating the Communist bandits west of the Dagu River, a unit of the National Army entered Jiaoxian City on the 5th and is currently mopping up the remaining bandits in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 6th] The equipment of the remaining bandits in the southwestern and central Shandong areas of Linzi and Huantai is being transported north across the river. The National Air Force has been bombing over a hundred crossings of the Yellow River and the Xiaoqing River used by the Communist bandits for days, with great success.</p>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The major annihilation battle in southwestern Shandong is proceeding intensely. The National Army is confident of victory. The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, originally surrounded by the National Army, including Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, 8th, and 14th Columns and the 13th Division of the 5th Column, after days of encirclement and attack by the National Army, had only about 20,000 men left. On the night of the 4th, they broke through and fled west of the Grand Canal, attempting to merge with Liu Bocheng's troops and then flee north across the Yellow River. Starting on the 5th, after being夹盘 by units pursuing them across the Grand Canal via Jiaxiang and Yuncheng, the bandits were again surrounded in the area between Wenkou and Dachanggou and are currently being encircled. The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, after days of regrouping, made a desperate attempt against the National Army in Huangkou and Linhuaiji. Although Jikou was invaded due to the disparity in numbers, and some of the remaining bandits forcibly crossed the Yellow River, they fled rapidly towards Guanxian via Puxian and Yanggu. However, their main force is still surrounded by the National Army in the central area of Linpuji, Zhongdui, and Fantun and will be easily annihilated. For days, the National Air Force has been bombing hundreds of boats and dozens of crossings set up by the Communist bandits along the river, day and night. Thousands of Communist bandits have been bombed and fallen into the river every day.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The National Army in Hebei has launched a mop-up operation in the triangular area of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding. The encirclement began from three directions on the morning of the 6th, with the goal of converging at Yongqing and Chaoxian. One route advances eastward from Anxin and Rongcheng, one route advances southward from Anci, and one route advances westward from Yangliuqing and Shengfang south of Tianjin. It is expected that this triangular area will be cleared up soon.</p>
<h3>Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan; Ministry of Economy is Actively Organizing; Difficulties in Returning Items Plundered by Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan is being actively organized by the Ministry of Economy. After this organization is established, the candidates for the business delegation to Japan will be reviewed by it and then approved and announced by the Executive Yuan. It is said that the delegation will not be able to depart until September 1st at the earliest. Furthermore, Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the Industrial Association, will hold a reception for the press after arriving in Nanjing on the 7th to report on his views on opening trade with Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Wu Ban-nong, head of the Compensation and Return Group of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, stated: Although it is known that a large number of items plundered from China exist in Japan, the return of these stolen goods is extremely difficult due to insufficient evidence provided by the original Chinese owners or because the methods of request are inappropriate. At least the return date will be greatly delayed. Some owners only stated that their property was plundered by the Japanese, but failed to provide evidence to prove that they owned the items to support their claims. Such applications that do not comply with procedures require the Chinese delegation to exchange letters with the Chinese government seven or eight times before obtaining forms that can be accepted by the Allied authorities. Chinese owners are not clear about the procedures for requesting returns, so the return date of the items is delayed for a long time. Among the items plundered from China by Japan, there are 130 ships, 20 factories (mostly plundered from Guangzhou), a number of cars, and other items. However, only a small number of ships and factories have been returned to their original owners so far. Official procedures and the inefficiency of the Japanese government have greatly delayed the return date. The Chinese delegation submits 15 to 20 applications every week, but has not received any results. Those who apply for the return of items should first submit documents or photos to prove their ownership, submit a registration certificate, and briefly describe the time, place, and circumstances of the item being plundered. For example, in the case of a car, the engine and chassis numbers should be provided. If the certificate of ownership or registration certificate is lost or destroyed, assistance can be provided by sales stores or customs in the United States and other countries. In short, if the owner cannot provide sufficient evidence to prove his request, the return of the plundered items will be delayed for a long time.</p>
<h3>Problems with the Peace Conference with Japan; US Will Inform the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Well-informed sources here say that if the situation with the Soviet Union can be clarified in time, the United States will issue invitations to countries to attend the peace conference with Japan in early September. The United States will inform the Soviet Union in the next day or two, correcting the Soviet statement that the treaty should be drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference and that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should not participate in the peace conference on an equal footing. If the Soviet Union still insists on its position, the United States will consult with other countries. If a majority of countries agree that the Soviet Union's participation is not necessary, then the United States will proceed with the matter and issue invitations immediately.</p>
<p>In addition, it is learned that Australian Ambassador Makin informed the State Department that the Australian government believes that the proposed representation standards for convening the peace conference by the United States should have higher standards. The Australian government hopes that its Foreign Minister can participate in this peace conference from the beginning, which means that it does not approve of convening a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers. According to officials, the United States will not insist on its position and may first have the main personnel conduct this meeting and then hold a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, China advocates that all resolutions should be established after the consent of three of the four major powers (China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and two-thirds of the eleven countries. The United States believes that China made this proposal because it fears that modifying the veto power will endanger its interests. Regarding the issue of retaining Japan's substantial economic recovery capabilities, it is said that China's position is also inconsistent with that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Now that China advocates a two-thirds vote procedure, it may be able to obtain the support of the Soviet Union to maintain China's position. However, if the compensation issue still cannot be resolved by the Far Eastern Commission when the peace conference with Japan is convened, then China can only rely on the support of the United States to obtain a larger allocation.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 6th, broadcast: Hawaiian Congressman Farrington suggested that the peace treaty with Japan should be signed in Hawaii, saying that the Pacific War broke out here and that it is located in the center of the Pacific, so Hawaii is the most ideal place to sign the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>President Chiang's Golden Statue</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon Dedicate Funds to Cast [Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th] The Overseas Chinese Dedication Committee in Hong Kong and Kowloon began casting President Chiang's golden statue on the afternoon of the 5th. The gold used was all donated by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon after the war. The golden statue is a half-length portrait of President Chiang without a hat, wearing the uniform of a Grand Marshal. The statue work will take about five days to complete, and it will be presented to President Chiang after completion.</p>
<h3>To Stop Large-Scale Smuggling in Hong Kong and Macao; We Have Adopted Strict Measures; Dong Xian-guang and Ye Gong-chao Answer Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM today. Director Dong Xian-guang answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) suggested transporting 50,000 tons of relief supplies to the Communist areas. Does the government agree? Is it reasonable for UNRRA to stop transporting materials to North China?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government is extremely concerned about the people who have suffered for a long time in the Communist areas. It hopes that the UNRRA materials can really reach the hands of the people in the Communist areas. If it does not contradict the above-mentioned purpose of relieving the people, then the government does not oppose the transport of materials to the Communist areas. As for whether it is reasonable for UNRRA to temporarily stop transporting materials to North China, it seems appropriate to leave it to UNRRA to answer.</p>
<p>(Question) Which of the items imported by Fu Chung and Yangtze companies does the government consider to violate import regulations?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the investigation report released by the Ministry of Finance on August 1st, none of the items imported by Fu Chung and Yangtze companies violated import regulations. Fu Chung Company handled two Cadillac cars on behalf of customers. At first, the customs did not allow them to be released. Later, it was proven that the two cars were used old cars, manufactured in 1942, and were declared on behalf of customers, not for sale, so they could be imported according to law.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Chinese government's estimate of the amount of smuggling imported from Hong Kong and Macao? What are the main items of smuggling? It is falsely rumored in Manila that a large amount of gold is imported from Macao. Is this true? What steps has the government taken to stop smuggling? Has it asked the authorities in Hong Kong, Macao, the United Kingdom, and Portugal to help stop smuggling?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is difficult, if not impossible, to make even a rough estimate of the amount of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao. According to the statistics for 1946, the value of smuggled import and export goods confiscated throughout the country was about 11.3 billion yuan. The main items of smuggled imports were wool textiles, cigarettes, soap, soda, cosmetics, cotton yarn, ginseng, and flour, with wool textiles being the most important. The smuggled export items, all passing through Hong Kong and Macao, were tungsten, eggs, silver coins, and domestic medicinal materials. Regarding the smuggling of gold from Macao, we have not heard of it. The government has taken various strict measures to stop smuggling. Recently, the number of anti-smuggling personnel stationed near the border of Hong Kong has been doubled, and the equipment for anti-smuggling has also been greatly improved. In addition to the original anti-smuggling vessels, fast vessels have been added.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao, Vice Minister Ye Gong-chao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following supplementary report: The Chinese government expresses serious concern about the increasing amount of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly requested the British Foreign Office and the Hong Kong government to establish an effective anti-smuggling agreement with us as soon as possible, but the British side has not responded. Although China has been studying strict anti-smuggling measures and preparing to implement them on our border, it still hopes that the British government will also understand the seriousness of this issue and effectively stop the large amount of smuggling in and out of Hong Kong based on the cooperative anti-smuggling methods agreed upon by both China and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>(Question) What are Director Dong's opinions on the remarks of Professor Pei Fa of the United States regarding advocating for the cessation of aid to China to promote reform?</p>
<p>(Answer) Professor Fei recently published an article "The Time to Withdraw from China," in which he stated that there are three options for stopping the Soviet Union's development in China: (1) The Chinese government implements political reforms. Pei said that this will take time. (2) The United States stations at least one million troops on the Chinese border, but he said that this is not permitted by American public opinion. (3) The United States withdraws from China and at the same time makes the Soviet Union take the same action. It is said that this is the only way to avoid war with the Soviet Union. Pei's article seems to imply that China is a breeding ground for international war. I should state that China has absolutely no intention of dragging the United States or other countries into war. China has suffered greatly from past wars. If there is another war, it will be harmful to us and not beneficial. What Fei said about China needing to reform its politics is a constructive suggestion. However, if he misinterprets China's political reform as a superficial gesture in order to obtain financial assistance from abroad, it will only expose his lack of understanding of China's national policy. China has been promoting political reform for a considerable amount of time, but the reason why it has not achieved remarkable results is because the Communist bandits' rebellion is always an obstacle. Although the government has its shortcomings, if China can hold a public opinion poll, it is deeply believed that the vast majority of the people will still support the government and despise the Communist bandits who create chaos and profit from it.</p>
<h3>Second Protest Against the Beitashan Incident; We Received a Reply from the Soviet Union; Vice Minister Ye Said the Government is Considering It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Vice Minister Ye Gong-chao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs answered questions about diplomatic issues at the press conference of the Information Bureau on the 6th as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the second protest against the Xinjiang incident, has the British, Soviet, or foreign side replied?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a note from the Soviet government on August 5, replying to the Chinese government's second protest against the Beitashan incident. Our government is currently considering it based on the new reply from the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Ye Gong-chao said that China had submitted a counter-proposal to the British draft of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty to the British Foreign Office nearly six months ago, but the British side has not yet clarified its position. This may be due to changes in the situation in India, Burma, and Malaya.</p>

<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Splits Again; Central Personnel Already Decided by the Standing Committee; Reformers Break Away from the Mother Body; Wu Xianzis' 代主氏</h3>
<p>[Our City Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held its first Standing Committee meeting after the National Congress at 9:00 AM yesterday. Sixteen standing committee members attended, chaired by Zhang Junmai. In addition to discussing general routine cases, it was resolved to reorganize the central personnel as follows: (1) Secretary-General: Jin Houcheng, Deputy Secretary-Generals: Yang Yuzi, Sun Yafu, (2) Director of the Organization Department: Zhan Yiqiao, Deputy Directors: Cheng Qizhi, Feng Jinbai, (3) Director of the Propaganda Department: Xu Chuanlin, Deputy Directors: Jiang Yuntian, Cui Xinyi, (4) Director of the Social Affairs Department: Wu Zheng, Deputy Directors: Chen Tao-kun, Li Zhizhen, (5) Director of the Overseas Department: Yang Lingming (acting), Deputy Directors: Yang Tanming, Zheng Tianxie, (6) Director of the Women's Department: Luo Jingxuan, Deputy Director: Chen Dingxiu, (7) Director of the Election Office: Wang Shixian, (8) Executive Director of the Political Research Committee: Li Wei, (9) Secretary of the Standing Committee: Liu Zhongyi, (10) Spokesperson: Cui Xin, (11) Representative in Nanjing: Jiang Yuntian.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The "Reform Committee" and the "Overseas General Branches" of the Democratic Socialist Party held a reception for the press at 3:30 PM yesterday, issuing a joint statement with the following main points: (1) They do not recognize the National Congress convened by the Democratic Socialist Party. (2) The Democratic Socialist Party was formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Democratic Constitutional Party. Now the Reformers and Overseas Party members have joined forces, accounting for three-quarters of the party's total strength according to the party's constituent forces. (3) They elected Vice-Chairman Wu Xianzi as the acting chairman and scheduled the first congress to be held in Shanghai on August 15. According to key members of the Reformers, "In the future, more than 70 representatives will attend the National Congress, and there will be at least four overseas representatives. Zhang Dongsun has decided to participate, and Fei Xiaotong and Pan Guangdan have not yet made a formal statement. Our internal proposition is peaceful, democratic, and unified. In diplomacy, we advocate a neutral position between the United States and the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Local Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party Also Organize a Friendship Association</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In addition to the Reformers and Overseas General Branches, another new dispute has arisen after this National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party: More than 70 provincial and municipal representatives have formed a friendship association at this congress. They have a strong conflict with the central leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party. According to the attending representatives Wang Renjun and Li Xiangdong, the central leadership used the method of "selecting representatives," making it impossible for the provincial and municipal representatives, who should have been in the majority, to express their opinions at all, and they were in a disadvantageous position in important votes. The election was controlled by a small number of people, and the attending representatives had no supervisory rights over the vote counting, resulting in many abuses. At the same time, the way the representatives were produced lacked democracy. For example, Wu Xingzhi, a central committee member from Guizhou, had already been elected, but Zhang Junmai ordered him to resign. Currently, the central leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party regards the provincial and municipal representatives' friendship association as the "second reform committee," and the friendship association is also determined to fight, hoping to achieve two goals: (1) To get Zhang Junmai on the right track, (2) To clear away the manipulators around Zhang Junxun. At the same time, the representatives of the friendship association pointed out that many key members of the Democratic Socialist Party had suspicions of collaborating with the enemy during the war, and they are currently collecting evidence to make a public accusation.</p>

<h3>River Water Levels Continue to Rise, Bandits Redig Dikes, Flood Area in Northern Jiangsu Expands, Guanyun, Suqian, and Xiao Counties Become Marshlands</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 6th] Rivers in northern Jiangsu have overflowed, and the affected area continues to expand. According to reports today, the water level at Tanshaji on the Grand Canal has reached 26.8 meters, and both the old and new dikes have collapsed. The water level in Huangdun Lake in Suqian is very high, and the dike projects in Zhouguan and Lincheng are in urgent condition. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau has been rushing to transport burlap bags, lead wire, etc., overnight and has sent personnel to supervise the emergency repairs. In addition, Guanyun, Suqian, and Xiao counties have also become marshlands due to excessive rainfall and rising river water levels. Today, this reporter inquired with Director Xiao of the Construction Department whether there was a possibility of flooding in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu this year. According to him, the water level in the Grand Canal south of the Huai River has not yet reached a dangerous level. If there are no major changes within ten days, the counties of Dongtai and Taixing in the Lixiahe area may be able to avoid flooding.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xinpu, 6th] In the Haizhou area, bandit troops recently dug up the Huang Dadi dike on the Chaimihe River again, causing the water level in the flooded area to rise by one foot. The suburbs of Zhuoyun City in Donghai County are several feet deep in water, and the autumn crops have been tragically submerged, leaving millions of people homeless and without food.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 6th] In view of the increasing severity of the floods in Xuhai and Huaihe, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed the counties in northern Jiangsu to mobilize a large labor force to repair the river dikes and has also telegraphed the central government, urging them to expedite the allocation of flour to the counties of Pi, Su, and Sui, which have been hit hardest by the disaster, for emergency distribution. It is reported that more than 1,000 men, women, and children have died from drowning and starvation in Pi County alone, and the disaster victims are crying out for food, making the situation extremely tragic. It is reported that the remaining communist bandits in Huaihai believe that the floods in the Yi and Shu Rivers have caused widespread disasters, bringing trouble to northern Jiangsu, which they see as an opportunity to be seized. They have secretly sent a large number of bandit military and political workers to infiltrate the disaster area and induce disaster victims to join the army. The authorities have telegraphed all counties to take strict precautions and rescue the disaster victims.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 6th] The flooded area in northern Anhui has expanded. Siyang County has been experiencing prolonged rainfall, and the nine townships in the northwest have become marshlands, with the disaster situation being extremely severe and the autumn harvest hopeless. The Huai and Fei Rivers in Shouxian and Fengtai have also risen, and the bridge outside the north gate of Shouxian has been submerged, with the water approaching the city gates.</p>

<h3>Severe Drought in Yikezhao League, Refugees Flee, Many Children Abandoned and Urgently Need Shelter</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guihua, 6th] The Yikezhao League drought inspection team, led by Chang Peisan, crossed the river from Baotou into Yikezhao League on the 4th. According to the team's report to Suiyuan, disaster victims in the Shanbei area of Yikezhao League are fleeing the area in two directions. One route passes through Yikezhao League and heads east to the Shakoutang area of Ningxia, seeking refuge in western Suiyuan. The other route passes through Dongsheng Dalate Banner and crosses the river at Dashuwan to the Baotou area. There is now a large number of famine victims gathered at Dashuwan. On the way, the famine victims cannot support themselves due to hunger and cannot carry their young children. They tie them to trees with ropes, and the parents cry bitterly and leave after the children die. Because the disaster situation in Yi Meng is so tragic, Chang Peisan telegraphed Chairman Dong, instructing the relief agencies in Baotou, Fengzhen, Guihua, and Wuyuan to accommodate the refugees as much as possible to provide relief. Du Pinshan, Director of the Suiyuan Social Affairs Department, has allocated special funds to supplement the relief agencies in various places and has sent special personnel to quickly establish a relief agency in Wuyuan to accommodate the refugee children who have fled to western Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guihua, 6th] Qi Yongquan, Director of the Provisional Rehabilitation Committee of Jungar Banner in Yikezhao League, sent a telegram on the 29th of last month to Director Zuo Yi and Chairman Dong Qiwu, urgently reporting the drought situation in Jungar Banner. The original telegram read as follows: "The disaster situation in this banner has reached a critical and severe stage. The crops have withered and died due to drought, and people's hearts are panicked and uneasy. Driven by hunger, they are fleeing one after another, with an average of nearly hundreds of households fleeing every day. Many children are abandoned by disaster victims along the way, which is extremely tragic. The method is to bury the child in sand after the child falls asleep, and the parents abandon them with unspeakable grief. Who doesn't have children? Who doesn't love their children? But if there is a glimmer of hope, they would not perform this tragedy. This telegram is submitted urgently. Please provide a large amount of material relief quickly to stabilize the area and save the people's lives."</p>
<h3>Widespread Disaster Area in Hebei, Social Affairs Department Releases Statistics</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] This year's severe drought in Hebei Province has caused a tragic disaster situation. According to statistics from the Provincial Social Affairs Department's drought disaster survey over the past month, the disaster has affected 35 counties and cities, including Jixian, Pinggu, Tongxian, Xincheng, Zhuoxian, Rongcheng, Qingyuan, Mancheng, Dingxing, Xushui, Baxian, Wenan, Tianjin, Sanhe, Wuqing, Douli, Miyun, Huairou, Shunyi, Yutian, Ninghe, Fengrun, Jinghai, Qingxian, Cangxian, Gengchang, Lilin, Qian'an, Funing, Beidaihe, Daxing, Anci, Tangshan, and Xianghe, with a total of 5,184,719 people affected, accounting for more than half of the total population of the above-mentioned areas. The disaster situation is most severe in Jixian and Tongxian counties. According to the person in charge of the Hebei Social Affairs Department, the disaster situation in the recovered areas of Hebei Province is also severe, including drought, floods, insect plagues, earthquakes, and communist banditry. According to reports obtained by the department, the number of people affected in 59 counties and cities, including Shijiazhuang, Yongnian, Changyuan, Dongming, Yuanshi, and Zhao County, accounts for more than 76% of their total population, with Shijiazhuang and Yongnian being the worst affected, with the number of people affected accounting for more than 90% of the population in both areas.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Counties Report Disasters and Request Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 6th] Various counties in Shanxi have reported drought disasters to the provincial government and requested relief to avoid starvation. Traveling south along the Zhengtai Railway, from Taiyuan to Taigu, except for the area near Taigu, where there are many wells and the fields are lush for hundreds of miles, most of the autumn crops are withered. The farmers go to the fields, look up at the sky and sigh, saying, "Good to plant wheat if it rains during the three伏 days." If there is no rain, not only will the autumn harvest be hopeless, but also the sowing of wheat will become a problem.</p>
<h3>Hankou Water Level Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Hanyang River Water is Level with the Shore</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 6th] Today, the water levels in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and along the Lishui River have fallen. The water level at Xin'di Jianli rose slightly. The water level in Hankou continues to rise, reaching 25.08 meters today. The river water along the eastern gate of Hanyang is level with the shore.</p>
<h3>Government Cooperates with Cotton Textile Industry to Compete for Overseas Sales Market in Southeast Asia, Decides to Assist Production and Sales through Weaving on Commission Basis</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Recently, several cotton textile manufacturers, in view of the fact that Japanese goods are planning to dump goods in Southeast Asia, have jointly organized production and sales agencies and requested government assistance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly consulted with relevant agencies and has now decided to adopt the principle of weaving on commission. The method is that the government will lend cotton yarn, lend labor costs, and give reasonable profits. The finished products will be collected by the government for export. The detailed production and sales plan is being drafted by the department's competent authority to help reduce the cost of cotton textile products with government assistance, so as to compete for the Southeast Asian market. Cotton textiles belong to the current revised temporary measures for import and export trade, Annex (3) B, and will be temporarily suspended from rotation before a separate announcement is made, so Japanese cotton textiles will not be dumped in our country for the time being. The ways to help reduce the cost of cotton products supplied domestically are: (1) Raise funds to increase domestic cotton production. There are about 40,000 spindles in the country, which requires about 1,200 dan of cotton. It is estimated that the total domestic cotton production this year is about 10 million dan. Except for cotton for self-use (estimated at about 5 million dan), the difference is quite large. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the former Textile Industry Management Committee to allocate 20 billion yuan of national currency from the surplus of yarn and cloth in its custody as a fund to promote the increase of domestic cotton production, in order to achieve the goal of increasing domestic cotton production by 15 million dan. (2) Stipulate cotton industry loans. This year's cotton industry loans have been approved for 120 billion yuan and are now being supervised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for lending.</p>
<h3>Transfer and Transport of Mines and Factories in Northeast and North China to the South is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] After the rumor that the mines and factories in Northeast and North China under the Resources Commission would be dismantled and transported to the south spread, it greatly affected people's hearts. According to Wei Shiliang, director of the Pingjin Office of the Commission, the rumor is not accurate, or it may be a mistake in the allocation of machinery. The south needs a large amount of coal and iron from the north, but due to inconvenient transportation, the transportation is very difficult. Therefore, there are plans to strengthen mining in stable areas in the south such as Hunan and Jiangxi, and at the same time increase the steel production in Ma'anshan and Daye. The insufficient machinery is planned to be dismantled from the wealthy parts of the Northeast for application, without the distinction between north and south. For example, more than 700 boxes of equipment from the Chongqing Radio Factory were transported to Tianjin for application. In addition, some of the hardware and equipment produced by various factories in Northeast China have recently been transported to Tianjin and Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Sun Yueqi, deputy director of the Resources Commission, did not come to Beiping today because the "Bawang" aircraft did not arrive. Sun came to Beiping to go to the Northeast to preside over the restoration of industry and mining after the five major destructions by the communist army. Tai Shihui once telegraphed the central government, requesting to send a senior official to go quickly.</p>
<h3>This Year's Heavy Summer Rainfall Affects Salt Production in the North</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Due to heavy rainfall in the summer, the output in the North has been greatly affected. In the past, the Changlu in Hebei and the Lianqu area near Qingdao in the city could produce 13 million dan of salt between April and August, but it is estimated that only 7 million dan can be produced this year, and the Yongli Factory alone needs 3 million dan of salt annually.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Promotes People's Economy, Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Shops are Scrambling to Reduce Prices</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 6th] Shanxi Province is actively promoting the people's economy. Merchants, unable to obtain excessive profits, are transferring funds to Pingjin, Shanghai, Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, Baotou, and Xi'an. The business of shops in the city is also restricted, and a frenzy of selling off goods has erupted. The streets are plastered with advertisements such as "Sacrifice Capital at Great Discount" and "Celebration Commemoration, 20% Discount", etc. After the sharp drop in prices, there is a scramble to sell off goods at reduced prices, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in the city.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Develops Production, Establishes Nine Factories Including Steel and Chemical</h3>

<h3>More Than 370,000 Ounces of Gold Smuggled from the Philippines to Shanghai and Macau, Philippine Ministry of Finance Orders Customs to be Strictly Prepared</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 6th] It was learned today that several aircraft recently transported 377,000 ounces of gold from Manila to Macau. Last September, the Hong Kong government banned the import of gold, and this spring it banned the transit of gold to Macau, making the area a major hub for gold imports in southern China. In Manila, after receiving this report, Philippine Finance Minister Guadeño ordered the Customs to be strictly prepared. The black market price of gold in Macau is US$51 per ounce, so the value of the smuggled gold is US$19,227,000.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Seriousness of Smuggling in South China!</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government recently released its trade statistics for the past six months, one of which is particularly noteworthy. That is, Hong Kong exported 950 tons of tungsten ore in the past six months, while importing only 400 tons of tungsten ore in the same period. What is even more noteworthy is that during the past six months, representatives of Soviet commercial agencies in Hong Kong have been vigorously purchasing tungsten ore. Hong Kong's exports of tungsten ore to the Soviet Union included the imported tungsten ore in the same period and more, which shows that Soviet representatives in Hong Kong are sparing no effort to purchase tungsten ore. The transmission of this news makes us have to pay attention to some issues again. The first is naturally the seriousness of the smuggling problem in South China; the second is the purchasing policy of the Resources Commission; and the third is the surge in the Soviet Union's need for tungsten ore.</p>
<p>Tungsten is necessary for steelmaking. Although China's steelmaking industry is not developed, we are blessed with unique advantages, and our tungsten ore production accounts for more than 75% of the world's total. The border area between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi is a world-famous tungsten ore producing area. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, tungsten ore has been controlled by the Resources Commission because it is our country's main mineral for export. In those years, when American planes came to our China one after another across the Hump, they also carried tungsten ore. Tungsten ore is one of our main commodities for earning foreign exchange. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has ended victoriously, we still need to earn foreign exchange because of our debts, so tungsten ore is still controlled by the Resources Commission. The statistics published by the Hong Kong government clearly show that Hong Kong imported 400 tons of tungsten ore and exported 950 tons in the past six months, so at least 550 tons of tungsten ore was imported into Hong Kong through smuggling; the number of smuggled imports that have not yet been exported is naturally even more impossible to count. Since tungsten is a mineral product of South China, it can be seen how serious smuggling in South China is.</p>
<p>When it comes to smuggling in South China, most people guess that unscrupulous merchants use Hong Kong to evade our tariffs and trade controls, and they mostly focus on imports. In fact, smuggling in exports has long been a big loophole, and this kind of shocking smuggling has almost existed since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it is only "more serious now." The relevant government authorities have not neglected the seriousness of the smuggling situation in South China. The import and export authorities have repeatedly traveled south to discuss countermeasures. However, the lure of profit is where everyone is going, and this trend cannot be stopped, and there is even a trend of intensifying. It is said that the organization is tight-knit and large-scale, and not only are unscrupulous merchants active, but also bureaucrats and soldiers are behind the scenes. Their pursuit of private gain at the expense of the country is really shocking. How to stop smuggling, fundamentally speaking, we should actively find ways to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon, so that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a special status, but this seems unlikely to be achieved in a short time. We should severely crack down on smuggling, and we should give anti-smuggling personnel preferential treatment and reward them heavily. Most importantly, corrupt officials, lawless soldiers, and unscrupulous merchants who collude with them must be severely punished without leniency. The trend of smuggling may be slightly abated.</p>
<p>However, there is also a major economic reason why smuggling occurs, which is that it is profitable. Taking tungsten ore alone, the price per load in the Hong Kong market is about US$100, while the price purchased by the Chinese government is said to be only one-third of the market price, that is to say, the government purchases tungsten ore at an official price equivalent to US$30, causing people engaged in tungsten ore production or operation to lose more than US$60 per load. This loss is considerable. Under these circumstances, smuggling tungsten ore has become their only way out. What we do not understand is that keeping the official purchase price too low is tantamount to encouraging smuggling. Is this the government's proper policy? Or are there some officials in the government who deliberately create this loophole? If we want to stop the smuggling of tungsten ore, then, thinking from the root, we must re-consider the official purchase price, so that those engaged in smuggling have no profit to be made, and then the trend of smuggling will stop without being suppressed.</p>
<p>At this point, we cannot help but think of the Soviet Union's large-scale purchases of tungsten ore, which undoubtedly shows that it is actively supplementing its steelmaking military industry, which is a symbol of its military preparedness. Since the implementation of the Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan, all its efforts have been concentrated on military preparations. The purchase of tungsten ore undoubtedly shows that it is actively preparing to manufacture weapons in preparation for the coming of World War III. We have control of the world's tungsten production, but we ourselves have failed to make use of this natural endowment, how can it not be heartbreaking!</p>
<h3>My Stance on the Indo-Dutch Dispute: Firm and Clear; Calls for Immediate End to Hostilities</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the Indo-Dutch conflict, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after careful consideration, issued a statement on the 6th through its spokesperson, saying: The Chinese government's policy is very firm and clear. First, on the principle of politics, the Chinese government sympathizes with Indonesia's liberation and advocates that the Indo-Dutch military conflict must be terminated immediately. Based on this policy, before the outbreak of this Indo-Dutch conflict, our government had jointly sought to avoid the conflict with the British and American governments. After the conflict occurred, our representative to the Security Council immediately voted in favor of the United Nations' demand for a ceasefire, which was completely different from the position adopted by the British, French, and Belgian governments at the time. Second, our government strongly believes that the Dutch government must fulfill its legal responsibility to protect overseas Chinese, and Indonesia must stop applying the scorched-earth policy to the lives and property of overseas Chinese. China's demand is in line with international law and humanitarianism. Our government will never ignore it for any reason. This time, the Dutch side has been more diligent in rescuing distressed overseas Chinese in some areas, which is significantly better than in the past. The Indonesian side has also promised to stop the atrocities of Indonesian troops. Although the conflict has stopped, our government is still in continued negotiations regarding the safety and relief of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office Suggests Four-Point Measures for Protecting Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Office, 6th] In the Dutch-Indonesian war, the lives and property of our millions of overseas Chinese are not protected. The Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office recently telegraphed the central government, suggesting four measures for protecting overseas Chinese: (1) Request the UN Security Council to order both the Dutch and Indonesian sides to effectively protect the neutral nationals residing in the territory; (2) China should participate in sanctions; (3) The central government should send high-ranking officials to the Netherlands and Indonesia to console the distressed overseas Chinese and negotiate compensation for losses with the local governments; (4) Transport distressed overseas Chinese back to the country, or ask international refugee organizations to assist in dispatching ships to transport overseas Chinese, and set up factories in the country for resettlement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Fujian Provincial Assembly Committee accused the Dutch and Indonesian sides of killing our overseas Chinese and looting property during the war and telegraphed the central government to lodge a protest.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Brebes Report on Their Suffering</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 6th] Regarding how the overseas Chinese in Brebes, twelve kilometers west of Tegal, became homeless and destitute, refugees from Tegal have prepared a report to the Chinese General Association. The report stated: On July 24, one thousand overseas Chinese in Brebes were all concentrated in the Chinese General Association. The next day, they were ordered by the Indonesian military to evacuate, walking to an undeclared area and not allowed to carry heavy objects. The report also stated that the reason for not allowing them to stay in the Chinese General Association was that the association had hoisted the national flag. The Indonesian army also tore up our national flag. It continued: On the third day, July 26, they evacuated further to a place called Bawah Gambir. Dutch and Eurasian mixed-race refugees in that area were assassinated by local terrorists. The overseas Chinese refugees were then divided into several groups, living in thatched huts. Fortunately, they still had money and were able to buy food from the locals. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, they fell into the hands of the Dutch army. On the 28th, the overseas Chinese, under the protection of the police, returned to Brebes, but their houses were either burned to ashes or looted. Therefore, they flocked to the small town of Parisdeng, with one hundred and two people crammed into small rooms that could only accommodate up to twenty-five people. The Indonesian police not only did not provide protection, but also locked the prison doors and fled. Three hours later, the Dutch army came to the rescue. The reporter visited the area on the 29th, and the tragic scene was indescribable. They have now been evacuated to Tegal, where our Chinese General Association is taking care of them.</p>
<p>More Than 3,000 Overseas Chinese in Salatiga Missing</p>

Salatiga and Ambarawa are both located south of Semarang. When our consul went to inspect the area, he discovered traces of various acts of destruction by the Indonesian army. According to reliable sources: The evacuated overseas Chinese are now living in rubber forests twenty kilometers east of Salatiga, but some have also fled south.</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Matsumoto Impersonates Taiwanese, Sneaks into Taiwan and is Arrested for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] On the 4th, the Taiwan Provincial Police Department arrested a Japanese man named Matsumoto in Xizhi Town, Qingshui District, Taipei County, No. 38, Xinwangli, for impersonating a Taiwanese person to sneak into Taiwan. They also found on his person various documents such as a food ration coupon from the Hou Sheng Department of the Taiwanese Compatriots Association in Japan and a repatriation permit from the Representative Delegation in Japan.

He then boarded the Tainan ship to Taiwan in May of this year. The Police Department is now investigating the case according to law. Furthermore, the department recently received a report that the Zhongxing ship sailing from Shanghai to Taiwan was carrying a large number of smuggled goods and colluding with personnel from a certain agency to engage in smuggling. They immediately sent personnel to investigate and have now seized more than 1,200 cartons of Marlboro cigarettes and Western medicine.

<h3>Scientific Expedition Team Climbs New High Mountain; Low Air Pressure Causes Tired Limbs, Dizziness, and Blurred Vision; Locals Walk Very Fast, Far Beyond Ordinary People</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Office, 6th] Your reporter accompanied the sixteen-member Scientific Expedition Team to New High Mountain and arrived at 5:00 PM on the 4th. Everyone embraced maximum courage to climb this only peak in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Walking 21 kilometers from Alishan to Er Yu, they finally arrived at New High Mountain. Due to the steep and dangerous mountain road, at an altitude of 3,950 meters, facing wind, rain, and cold currents, and with low air pressure, the reporter and others felt tired limbs, dizziness, and blurred vision. They already had altitude sickness. There is only one weather station on New High Mountain, established in the 31st year of the Showa era (1956), it is the highest weather station in Southeast Asia. The six observers feel both physical and mental pain. Director Kiki Kazuo gave the expedition team the most sincere welcome. The station employs eight indigenous people to transport luggage for the group, walking very fast, far beyond the reach of ordinary people. Your reporter and others will spend three lonely but meaningful nights in the high mountains below freezing point. Researchers will use New High Mountain as the object and carry out investigations in various departments. It is even more interesting for the reporter to send telegrams from here. Shi Yanhai, Director of the Meteorological Bureau, and Bi Zhichang, Director of the Geological Survey Institute, and others, believe that the original name Wang Mountain should be restored for New High Mountain, because the Chinese people have no reason to continue to abide by the Emperor's decree. The New High Mountain is 200 meters higher than Mount Fuji. In the past, it was the highest in Japan. After the restoration, it returned to Chinese territory.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States to Hold Meeting to Review the British Economic Crisis; Terms of Loan Agreement May Be Relaxed; British Government Suddenly Submits New Economic Bill to Parliament</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 6th (Broadcast): British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the United States has agreed to discuss with Britain the relaxation of the US-British loan agreement. Attlee told the House that the agreement was established at a time when the United States gradually advanced credit loans of 3.75 billion yuan, which deepened the British economic crisis. Attlee said that the loan was originally intended to be used until 1950 and will be exhausted by the end of this year. Attlee said that if we can concentrate our efforts, the result will definitely be better. We remove restrictions or go through processes. Some workers do not realize that while shortening working hours and raising wages, they must intensify their efforts in their work. However, in general, the people have done their best and a large number of construction projects have been completed. Attlee specifically emphasized "increasing production and exports," saying that at the end of last year, British overseas sales increased by one percent compared to 1938.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Labor government yesterday suddenly submitted a new bill to Parliament, giving the North (government) extensive control over industry and labor. Opposition leader Churchill immediately convened a meeting of the opposition party after the bill was introduced to discuss countermeasures. The government's move came as a surprise, so angry opposition party members said they would force an extension of the current Parliament. However, a government spokesman has stated that the introduction of the bill is not a shortcut to socialism. It is expected that the Conservative Party leader will try to amend the bill to limit the government's powers to cope with the current economic situation. It is reported that the government's advisors strongly advocated the introduction of the bill. They believe that although the 1945 bill largely regulated the same powers, there were still some weaknesses and legal loopholes. The purpose of the previous bill was to enable the government to change the wartime economy to a peacetime economy, but whether this power can be applied to the dollar shortage crisis is still questionable. The new bill is named the Supply and Services Transitional Period Powers Bill, submitted to the Lower House by the Prime Minister himself and supported by the Cabinet's Economic Group, namely Privy Councilor Morrison, Finance Minister Dalton, Trade Minister Cripps, and Labor Minister Isaacs. The key points of the bill are: (1) The productive capacity of industry, commerce, and agriculture; (2) Promoting and guiding exports and reducing imports from various countries to balance trade; (3) Ensuring that national resources are fully utilized to serve the interests of the country.</p>
<h3>British Government Denies Prime Minister Will Visit the United States for Consultations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 6th (Broadcast): According to sources revealed by the government, Britain has requested the United States to discuss Britain's dollar problem as soon as possible, and it is expected that the US government will agree to this request. However, the government denied reports that Prime Minister Attlee would lead a delegation to Washington when the meeting is held.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Unofficial sources say that Prime Minister Attlee may lead Foreign Minister Bevin, Minister of Commerce Cripps, and others to Washington. President Truman has been notified of this. It is expected that it will be formally announced after the two-day economic crisis debate in the House of Commons is over. Observers believe that the purpose of this trip may be to explore the possibility of the United States providing financial assistance to Britain.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It was learned today that regarding the US loan of 300 million US dollars to Greece to support the country's resistance to communism, the State Department has decided to assist in the construction of highways, railways, and ports as soon as possible.

<h3>Bidault Cancels Visit to Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Authoritative sources here confirmed that French Foreign Minister Bidault has decided to cancel his visit to London to discuss the French plan to ratify the Anglo-French alliance treaty with Bevin.

<h3>US Diplomatic Officials Hold Meeting in Paris</h3>
<p>Considering the New US Economic Policy Toward Europe</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The arrival of four senior US diplomatic officials (Douglas, Clayton, etc.) in Paris has led general observers to believe that they will discuss the economic crisis in various countries between Britain and France here on the 5th, and its impact on the shifting of countries out of production. Calling experts said: Four diplomats are carefully considering the new US economic policy toward Europe to support non-communist countries in Western Europe. Diplomatic circles said: The meeting is already discussing the crisis of the British gold pound, and the result may be to find ways to reduce the burden of British occupation expenses. At the same time, the United States wants to make France agree to immediately increase German industrial production, so the result of the ambassador's meeting may also try to adapt to France's security requirements to prevent future German aggression.</p>
<h3>US Suggests Mediating the Indo-Dutch Dispute; Indonesian Response Remains Cold; No Conflicts Since the Ceasefire Order Took Effect</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yogyakarta, 6th] Indonesian dignitaries, including Prime Minister Sjahriruddin, broadcast to Australia today, refuting Dutch claims that a ceasefire has been in effect since midnight on the 4th. Sjahriruddin said that not only has the Dutch side not stopped military activities, but it is currently expanding its military gains through aggressive actions, causing the Indonesian archipelago to fall back into a state of slavery. Although US Consul General in Batavia Mr. Smith has made suggestions to the Republic's Deputy Prime Minister regarding mediation, we welcome mediation by the disaster-stricken country, but unless UN agencies can force the Dutch to retreat to the positions before the outbreak of the conflict, we remain doubtful as to whether mediation will have good results.</p>
<p>You (referring to the people of Oceania) must recognize that we have been attacked. If the Security Council does not require the aggressor to withdraw from the occupied land, then the purpose of the Security Council has obviously been defeated. If the goals achieved by the Netherlands through its launched war are not sanctioned in this way, then mediation is also useless. Prior to this, Sjahriruddin addressed the Working Committee of the Republic's Parliament, stating that the Republic could not accept mediation and could only accept the arbitration of the United Nations Committee. He accused the Dutch army of occupying Gomgong, one hundred miles west of Yogyakarta, two and a half hours after the ceasefire order took effect. Indonesian Deputy President Hatta announced in Sumatra that since the Dutch side has violated the ceasefire order, the Republic can also retaliate. The Dutch military bulletin stated that the actions currently taken by the Dutch army are "protective measures" and are different from the previous "police actions," stating that the Dutch activities on Madura Island are to protect the rice-producing areas, and the actions in the area west of Surabaya in eastern Java and in Gomgong in central Java were all completed before the ceasefire order took effect. Observers here believe that neither the Indonesian nor the Dutch side has complied with the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 6th] US Consul General in Batavia Mr. Smith formally handed over to Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Gani this morning the US statement expressing its willingness to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, and urged Indonesia to accept this suggestion. It is said that a mediation by one country may be more effective than mediation by a multi-country committee. Gani said that he would send it to the Yogyakarta government immediately, hoping to receive a reply tonight. The US statement also promised to send a delegation immediately once Indonesia agrees. However, Mr. Smith said that he knew nothing about the rumors that the delegation would be led by General Li Qi, former Chief of Staff of President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 6th] According to the Aneta news agency, citing Yogyakarta broadcasting: Indonesia will invite the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, China, Arab countries, India, Siam, the Philippines, Australia, and Newfoundland to send observers to Indonesia to conduct on-site investigations of the situation.</p>

<h3>Egypt Stresses Modification of the Treaty; British Representative Rejects the Request; Requests the Security Council to Withdraw the Indictment</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] British Representative Cadogan responded to Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy's request at the United Nations Security Council yesterday, denying Egypt's right to request modification of the 1936 treaty. He said that the treaty is still valid for nine years and neither party has the right to request modification before the expiration date. Therefore, since the treaty is still valid, Egypt has no reason to request the Security Council to handle it. Britain's inability to conduct treaty negotiations now is also not to blame. Therefore, he specifically requested the Security Council to withdraw the Egyptian case. At this point, the Security Council announced a recess and decided to debate again next Monday.</p>
<h3>Security Council Continues to Debate the Balkan Issue; Guerrillas on the Southern Border Are Active Again</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] Authoritative sources said today: If the United Nations Security Council is unable to deal with the Balkan issue due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto, the United States is prepared to submit it to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

<h3>The US-Japan Exchange Rate is Outdated; US Merchants Advocate for Revision; Plan to Use 200 Yen per US Dollar</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to informal sources from the US side on the 6th, the quota system for US businessmen visiting Japan may be cancelled by the end of the year due to "no need to do so." This assumption is based on the fact that by the end of the year, there will be sufficient convenience to deal with everyone who wants to come to Japan. The issue currently being discussed in Tokyo is when an international exchange rate can be established. On the one hand, the Allied Headquarters intends to stimulate trade and knows that the exchange rate is still the biggest factor in encouraging it. On the other hand, if the value of the US dollar is set too high, although it can satisfy foreign businessmen, its impact may cause Japanese inflation to rise in a straight line and promote the collapse of the Japanese economy. US merchants intend to stipulate an exchange rate of about 200 yen per US dollar, which is four times higher than the current military exchange rate advocated by the Allied Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Massive Fraudulent Withdrawal from City Bank: Most Funds Recovered, Two Criminals Arrested, Fugitive Chen Zhihe Allegedly Purchased Airplane Ticket to Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the incident of fraudulent withdrawal of a large sum of money from a certain bank using a forged seal, which was exposed by this newspaper yesterday, the following is an account of the police's investigation: The bank in question is the Shanghai City Bank. The incident occurred at 9:00 AM on the 26th of last month, when the bank opened for business. Two well-dressed young men, speaking with a Hangzhou accent, presented an immediate check from the Police Security Headquarters for 176 million yuan, along with three sacks to store the legal tender after receiving the payment. After the bank clerk verified the seal and registered the transaction, the full amount was paid. In a show of special consideration, the teller paid 90 million yuan in large ten-thousand-yuan notes. After receiving the money, one of the young men asked the teller to borrow the telephone, and it was learned from the phone call that they were contacting the Gu National Car Company to dispatch a car. Shortly thereafter, the car arrived, and the two men calmly carried the three sacks full of legal tender into the car and left. At 4:40 PM that day, the City Bank discovered that the Police Security Headquarters had overdrawn a large amount and inquired by telephone. The Headquarters denied the matter and stated that there had been no overdraft. When the bank re-examined the huge check and carefully verified the seal, it was discovered that the seal was forged. The bank immediately reported the information to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau, requesting investigation and pursuit. Under the direction of Section Chief Li, officers Ma Fei Mu and Sun Zhen Ying investigated and arrested the key suspect Qin Zheng Ming (26 years old, from Hangzhou, currently employed by the Police Security Headquarters) that evening in western Shanghai. After interrogation, Qin confessed that there were a total of three accomplices in the case, including Chen Zhihe (26 years old, from Hangzhou, a dismissed police officer) and Yang Yu Shan (23 years old, from Hangzhou). Qin had previously taken advantage of his position to steal a blank check from the City Bank. After discussing it with Chen and Yang, they decided to forge the three seals originally used by the Headquarters and issued a check for 176 million yuan dated the 26th. Chen and Yang went to withdraw the money. Qin was deeply afraid of being discovered by the bank, so he only accompanied them to the entrance of the City Bank and then went to a friend's house in western Shanghai until he was arrested. Therefore, he did not know anything about what happened after the withdrawal, he said.</p>
<p>Driven to the Weida Hotel: Plan to Dismiss the Driver</p>
<p>The police officers in charge planned to investigate again the next day, but because of the sudden case involving the "Golden Metropolis" conscript, the entire Criminal Investigation Division was ordered to investigate the truth, and the investigation had to be temporarily suspended. Soon after, Section Chief E ordered Ma Fei Mu to continue the investigation, and it was learned that after the two men got into the car with the money that day, they had ordered the driver to drive to the Weida Hotel. When they got out of the car, they asked him to help carry a sack to room 107. After paying the fare, they ordered him to drive to Jiangwan to pick up a Mr. Li, saying, "Everyone knows Mr. Li in Jiangwan Town, go quickly and come back quickly." When the driver returned empty-handed from Jiangwan and intended to report back to them, the two men had already settled their room bill and disappeared. Later, after the police inquired at the Weida Hotel, they learned that after the driver left, the two men bought three suitcases nearby, stored the money in them, and ordered the tea boy to settle the room bill, hiring two rickshaws to escape to the west.</p>
<p>Investigating a Strange Letter in Hangzhou, Leading to the Retrieval of Stolen Money in Shanghai</p>
<p>At this point, the police officers had no choice but to investigate the families of the two criminals and learned of Yang Yu Shan's Hangzhou address (22 Huixing Road). On the 31st, Ma and another officer, Wu Zuzhi, disguised themselves and went to Yang's home, where they found a strange letter sent from 16 Changsheng Lane, Changning Road, Shanghai, with many clues related to the case. They immediately telegraphed Section Chief E to report, and sent officers Chen Guangrong, Han Yongchang, and Sun Zhenying to the address, where they found two suitcases containing 104 million yuan in legal tender. They then waited at the location until late at night and arrested Yang Wangshan. According to Yang's confession, the two men had used the aliases Wang Qin and Zhou Guoming, and booked rooms 301 and 302 at the Xiang Sheng Hotel. When they rushed to the Xiang Sheng Hotel, Chen had already fled upon hearing the news. However, Chen had entrusted the Xiang Sheng Hotel to deposit 30 million yuan in legal tender, which has been seized by the police. Chen originally planned to go to Qingdao as a "safe haven" with the money, and Chen had already purchased a plane ticket from China National Aviation Corporation to Qingdao for the 1st of this month. At the Xiang Sheng Hotel, the police also seized two Western suits and three official seals belonging to the two criminals. In total, the recovered stolen money amounted to 155 million yuan, with 21 million yuan still missing. Currently, the police are continuing to pursue Chen Zhihe, and the two arrested criminals have been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

Later, Liu Gulin shouted 'robber.' What I had in my hand was all fines, and I did not rob anyone." Liu Gulin claimed: "Zhu and Chen asked me for more than one million, saying it was for expenses.

After questioning the witness Liang Changqing, Judge Rao declared: "The defendant has been detained for the full three-month statutory period, and it is necessary to extend it by two months due to factual needs." The defendant's defense lawyer stood up and stated: "The defendant Zhu Kai has been detained for several months, and this case has been delayed and has not been concluded.

<h3>Thousands of Years of Religious Cultivation: Five Ethnic Groups Achieve Strong Unity, Speaker Pan Welcomes the Pilgrimage Delegation from Islamic Countries at a Tea Party</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A delegation of forty pilgrims from Islamic countries, led by the head of the delegation, Aibodu La Damao La, and the deputy head of the delegation, Nai Zi Er Da A Ah, went to the holy land of Mecca in Arabia to participate in the pilgrimage ceremony on September 3. They passed through Nanjing and Shanghai, and met with Chairman Jiang in Nanjing, reporting on the border situation. They arrived in Shanghai by train a few days ago to wait for a boat trip. In recent days, they have visited various party and government agencies and religious organizations in the city. Speaker Pan of the City Council held a tea party to welcome them at 11:00 AM yesterday, and many Muslim senators from the council were invited to accompany them. During the tea party, Speaker Pan delivered a speech expressing his welcome and said: China is an ancient country with culture, and there is more than one religion and ethnic group in the country. However, over thousands of years of cultivation, the compatriots of all ethnic groups and religions have united together to form a great Republic of China.</p>
<p>Worthy of Our Permanent Remembrance</p>
<p>Since Islam was introduced to China from Arabia, the number of believers in our country, regardless of ethnicity, has been increasing day by day. In terms of region, this is the case in the northwestern provinces and border areas, and the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Yellow River basins are also the same. There are mosques and co-religionists everywhere, which proves that co-religionist culture has also constituted a part of Chinese culture and cannot be separated from Chinese culture. Some people believe that cultural communication is an essential element of national unity, and we must strive to work in the area of cultural communication in order to achieve the strong party of the unity of the five ethnic groups. Today, pilgrims from Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other provinces and border areas come to Shanghai, which is the first time since the victory. Especially since the purpose of this trip is to go to the holy land of Islam for pilgrimage, and the journey has traversed Chinese territory and major cities such as the capital Shanghai, it is of great help in communicating culture. Therefore, the significance of this trip is very profound and worthy of our permanent remembrance.</p>
<p>Made Great Contributions to the Country</p>
<p>Looking back on Chinese history, especially during the Sui and Tang dynasties, in the golden age of Emperor Taizong of Tang, and during the revitalization of Guo Ziyi, many famous figures in politics and military affairs were all Islamic believers, or Muslims and Turks, and made great contributions to the country. In other words, the compatriots in the border provinces and border areas have made great achievements for the country in the past, and it is believed that they will definitely continue to make greater contributions to the country in the future, just as the deeds shown in history. The Doctrine of the Mean says; "All things grow together without harming one another, and ways run parallel without conflicting with one another," which is the highest expression of the Chinese spirit, and we are willing to encourage each other with this. Speaking of Shanghai, the Council is an organ of public opinion. Although the senators have different ancestral homes and religious beliefs, they can all cooperate to build the city. We hope that all Muslim compatriots will also be like this, and work together to build the country.</p>
<p>Mayor Holds Tea Party Reception</p>
<p>After Speaker Pan finished his speech, the head of the delegation, Mr. Ai, delivered a speech in the Hui language to express his gratitude, and said: Muslims from various countries will participate in the pilgrimage to Mecca, and they will take the opportunity to promote our country's strong national power, advanced political facilities, and entry into the path of democratic politics. The speeches of Mr. Pan and Mr. Ai were translated by Ma Yunwen and Tu Le'gan respectively. The tea party ended at noon. The delegation went to the City Party Department to visit Director Fang, and Secretary Xie received them on behalf of Director Fang. Mayor Wu held a tea party at the City Hall in the afternoon. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai by boat the day after tomorrow.</p>

According to the complaint, Yuan Zhize, a bandit from their hometown, broke into Yuan's residence in the middle of the night in April of last year with a group of armed men and kidnapped the woman Aying.

<h3>Restoration of Cultivation in Yongcheng Dike, Yueyang: The Dawn of Agricultural Mechanization Revolution in Hunan</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Changsha] Hunan used to be the granary of China, and there was a saying among the people that "If Hunan and Guangdong are rich, the world will be full." However, our country's agriculture is still stuck in primitive times, relying purely on favorable weather. If the weather is unfavorable, regardless of floods, droughts, insect plagues, or other disasters, farmers are powerless to resist. After the war, in addition to a desolate wilderness, the rural areas were destroyed, and everything needed for cultivation, such as manpower, animal power, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, ponds, and dams, was lost. Since its establishment in the winter of 1945, the Hunan Branch has made every effort to restore cultivation in rural areas, distributing farm tools, rice seeds, vegetable seeds, fertilizers, loans, purchasing cattle, and subsidizing pest control, striving for timely restoration of cultivation in rural areas. Last year, they were able to barely overcome the disaster. This year, a bumper harvest is expected. However, this type of distribution work is ultimately a temporary solution. It is feared that it will be difficult to continue after the Hunan Branch ends. It is necessary to innovate our country's agriculture and develop new agriculture, which is a long-term solution.</p>
<p>The Hunan Branch takes the Yueyang Tractor Restoration Training Area as a demonstration of a mechanized farm in this regard. It has requested the headquarters to allocate 40 tractors, and 20 have already arrived. Fifty students have been recruited to train to restore cultivation in Yongcheng Dike. Yongcheng Dike has an area of ​​60,000 mu, and 30,000 mu are currently wasteland. The reeds are seven or eight feet high, and birds and beasts hide among them. After all the land is restored to cultivation, it can accommodate 15,000 households. If each household is calculated with five people, then 75,000 households will rely on this for their livelihood. The experiment of Yongcheng Dike's work has made farmers deeply interested and created belief, indicating that farmers are not too conservative. As long as there is perseverance to do it, it can still be reformed. Yongcheng Dike is just the beginning of new agriculture, and the innovation of the entire Hunan agriculture has a long way to go. The new businesses that the Hunan Branch has established in rural areas also include the pond-digging machine training class. Seven technicians have been trained and 20 ponds have been dug in Hengyang, with excellent results. Now, for the work in Yongcheng Dike in Yueyang, 41 water pumps have been allocated. The Hunan Branch has organized a water conservancy irrigation team to work in the counties that need it in July and August.</p>
<p>Another serious problem in the rural areas is livestock plague. For a farming household, a plow ox is the greatest asset. Losing a cow is more painful than losing a son. The Hunan Branch has organized a livestock treatment team to give farmers free injections to their plow oxen in various counties. At first, they hesitated, but after seeing that they did not suffer from the plague and were guaranteed to never suffer from the plague, they all rushed to request injections. The team was originally preventing cattle plague in Guanyang, but now it has been divided into two teams to prevent pig plague in Changsha, Ningxiang, and Liuyang.</p>
<p>According to the branch's statistics, the branch's agricultural relief work includes the following items: (1) distribution of seeds and fertilizers, (2) handling loans for plow oxen, (3) distribution of farm tools, (4) prevention and treatment of animal epidemics, and (5) restoration of Yongcheng Dike and management of tractor training areas. Yongcheng Dike is a mechanized demonstration farm. After 60,000 mu of wasteland is cultivated, it can accommodate 15,000 farm households to divide and cultivate.</p>
<p>As for industrial relief work, it includes the following items: (1) industrial and commercial loans, (2) lending small-scale industrial loans, (3) issuing small-scale business loans, (4) assisting various industrial manufacturers in applying for equipment, and (5) allocating and selling industrial equipment. As for the medical institutions subsidized by the Hunan Branch in Hunan Province, there are a total of 123 units.</p>
<p>For the urgent relief this year, the Hunan Branch entrusted the International Relief Committee to handle it, and the Hunan Branch and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) are jointly responsible for supervision. In fact, the food supply this year is unsustainable. It only carries out emergency relief in the 14 counties and cities with the most serious disasters, including Hengshan, Xiangxiang, Chaling, Anren, Hengyang, (city and county), Leiyang, Chen County, Changning, Qiyang, Shaoyang, Lingling, Dong'an, and Dao County. For the remaining 17 counties that reported disasters, only personnel were sent to investigate and report. In addition to the 5,000 tons of rice and flour and 5,000 tons of canned food allocated by the Hunan Branch, the Hunan Provincial Government distributed 5,000 tons of rice from the county and city granaries, for a total of 15,000 tons. At present, the number of disaster victims awaiting relief in each city and county is estimated at 20% of the number of disaster victims in July of last year, as the number of people to be relieved this year. Each person receives half a catty of food per day. (February, Ping)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Rushing to Complete the Work: Laying Track in Five Sections</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 6th] The Ministry of Railways originally planned to open the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to traffic by the end of the year, but it will only be open to traffic to Quzhou by the end of this month. In order to rush the work, the Railway Bureau has specifically set the track-laying progress, planning to carry out the work in five sections to complete the entire line by the end of November. The Pingxiang Gaokeng branch line is scheduled to open to traffic by the end of October to facilitate coal transportation. [Another telegram] The security agencies in the nine provinces south of the Yangtze River have been reorganized successively, and police security offices have been established. However, at the time of the recent mobilization to suppress the chaos, when the suppression of bandits was tense, the provinces had requested permission to establish garrison commands to facilitate military operations. It is now learned that Zhejiang Province, due to its better security, had been explicitly ordered not to establish one. Now that the police and security have been merged, the two ministries of National Defense and Interior Affairs have ordered the retention of the Security Commander. It is heard that other provinces will do the same. As for how to retain the Security Command, clarification is still needed.</p>

As they did not receive a satisfactory answer from the newspaper today, the newspaper was forced to suspend publication starting today.</p>
<h3>Bengbu High Court Investigates Zhang Licheng's Property Confiscation and Sale After Confiscation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Bengbu] Zhang Licheng, the former supervisor of the police station of the puppet provincial capital who was previously executed, was known for his tyranny and corruption. After the victory, he was captured on the spot by Liao Tiezheng, the former director of the city police station, and executed immediately. After Zhang's death, the huge amount of property he left behind was still enjoyed by his wives and children. Last month, the prosecutor of the First Branch Court here impeached him according to law. Subsequently, the Criminal Court pursued the judgment, confiscating all the property left behind by the traitor Zhang Licheng, except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

<p>[Report from our newspaper in Kaifeng] Countless passengers were burned to death in the Mangshan Tunnel on the Pinghan Railway the other day. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. According to a gentleman who was on the same train to Bian at the time: The smoke emitted from the locomotive chimney was black during the day and red at night. The weather that day was unusually hot. When the train traveled into the Mangshan Tunnel (which is about several miles long), the passengers sitting on top of the first two cars closest to the locomotive were the first to be hit by the smoke and fire emitted from the chimney. As a result, the passengers on top of the car cried out loudly due to the fierce fire, to no avail. Therefore, there was chaos with screams and wails. Some risked jumping off the train (jumping off the train in the tunnel was even more difficult to escape), some were burned to death with their hands holding their heads, and some women rolled under the car while holding their children. After the train arrived at Nan'an Station and stopped, it was found that there were 15 corpses on top of the car, all with their hands holding their heads, shaped like foot-long little monkeys, black and charred all over, and it was impossible to tell their gender. The situation was extremely tragic. The gentleman was riding in the rear car and was fortunate enough to escape the disaster. The exact number of people who fell off the car and died in the tunnel is still impossible to count. (3rd)</p>

<p>Yingda University to Build Temporary School Buildings; Relocation of the School is Temporarily Shelved; Construction of Permanent School Buildings Requires 40 Billion</p>
<p>[Our Jinhua Special Dispatch] The relocation of the Yingda University campus is now temporarily shelved. In order to meet the needs of expanding departments next year, the school authorities plan to find a suitable environment in Jinhua. In addition to continuing to lease some of the existing school buildings, such as the Fifth Prison, the Dacheng Hall, the Pagoda Temple, and the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall for a short period of time, the school affairs meeting has approved the construction of some temporary school buildings, including six large classrooms, one material testing room, one power plant, and one storage room. In addition, the county-run Jian Teachers' School will be borrowed and renovated into the school buildings for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The project is expected to start in mid-month.</p>
<p>In addition, the drawings of the permanent campus of Yingda University were drafted by the German engineer Paulick during the tenure of President Yang Gongda. The drawings include four colleges of Arts and Sciences, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering (the Medical College was not included at that time), as well as the Yingshi Memorial Hall, sports field, faculty dormitory, student dormitory, gymnasium... and dozens of other buildings, covering an area of more than a thousand acres. The estimated cost at that time was more than 20 billion, but due to the continued rise in prices, it was revised to 35.7 billion. According to the calculations of the professors of the College of Engineering, it is now impossible to start without more than 40 billion. The ideal base at that time was the Jinhua Lake Seawall, but after surveying, it was found that the soil was loose and could not be used. Although the principle of relocating from Jinhua has been decided, the school authorities still believe that this drawing is quite satisfactory, and it will inevitably be carried out according to this plan after the relocation is successful. The school now has only about 4 billion left for construction. It is said that if construction starts, friends of Mr. Yingshi during his lifetime are willing to help, so this plan still has hope of being realized.</p>

Central was originally the seed of the Yin Group and the champion of that group. Because they lost to Zhejiang Xing in their first match, their hopes of winning the championship were greatly reduced.

<p>Chen States Opinions on Opening Trade with Japan; Shanghai Industrial Representatives Go to the Capital Yesterday; Urges Temporary Suspension of Petition to Determine Raw Material Allocation Rights</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai industrial community, due to the government's decision to open trade with Japan, sent representatives Hu Baixiang, Mao Shengdong, Tian Heqing, Cheng Shouchong, Liu Qingyi, and more than ten others to the capital by special train at 11:00 PM last night to state four points of opinion to the authorities: (1) The raw materials and machinery imported should be limited to those allowed to be imported under the "Provisional Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade."

After discussions among the representatives, it was decided to postpone the trip to the capital for three days. During these three days, they will contact Director Zhang first. If there are no results, they will go to the capital.</p>
<p>Buyers Watch and Wait, Outport Merchants Remain Inactive; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Continues to Fall by 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was relatively quiet. Merchants from Tianjin and Guangdong remained slack. Although weaving factories added a little, the market remained sluggish. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn was 16.7 million yuan, continuing to fall by 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 200,000 yuan, to 14.8 million yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse was 12.1 million, down 200,000 yuan. Light Double Horse fell 100,000 yuan, to 10.3 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn such as 16-count Guangming Red Bee Hailong, and 10-count and 32-count, also decreased by varying amounts of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially opened with reports that a large quantity of Japanese yarn and cloth was being shipped from Shanghai to Southeast Asia, and that the cotton harvest in various places was quite good, with the new cotton season approaching, which would reduce the cost of yarn and cloth. Buyers in the market adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and outport sales were also inactive. Only local merchants had sporadic interest, and holders were unwilling to sell cheaply due to cost concerns, resulting in a stalemate. However, near the close, scattered sellers dumped their goods, and price cuts were frequent, with a chorus of selling in the market, and prices plummeted. As a result, 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth fell to 423,000 yuan, continuing to fall by 3,000 yuan from the previous day. Various fine cloths such as Fufu Blue Chicken Rainbow Ball Yanghe also continued to decline by 1,000 to 15,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and blue cloth also fell by varying amounts of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fangjian Sells Yarn</p>
<p>Also, China Fangjian Company opened yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 168 pieces of various counts, and manufacturers submitted 69 purchase orders. Due to the sluggish yarn market, the company's list price was 200,000 yuan lower for 6-count Sunlight Coarse Yarn than the previous period, at 5.7 million yuan. 32-count Three-Strand Eight Horse Yarn was 700,000 yuan lower, at 13.8 million yuan. 32-count Xiantao Cone Yarn was 12.8 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the negotiated price. 40-count Sunlight Cone Yarn was 100,000 yuan lower, at 14.5 million yuan. 42-count Chestnut was 300,000 yuan lower, listed at 14.7 million yuan. 60-count Sunlight Cone Yarn was 300,000 yuan lower, at 20.2 million yuan. 60-count Double-Strand Chestnut was 500,000 yuan lower, at 21.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn were similar to the previous period.</p>
<p>Also, private factories opened yarn. Yongsha opened about 200 pieces of various counts of Jincheng brand yarn a few days ago, and Siyi opened about 100 pieces of various counts of Jinji brand yarn. Yesterday, Anda opened nearly 100 pieces of 32-count Flying Tiger brand, and Shenxin opened dozens of pieces of Hongren Bell, all sold at negotiated prices. However, due to the market decline yesterday, some yarn numbers were no longer profitable after being purchased.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Market Improves</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market improved. Although yarn and cloth fell, yarn factories were still keen to purchase, but due to price limits, transactions mostly stalled halfway. Holders believe that it will take two months for new cotton to enter the market, and they are unwilling to sell at a discount during this lean period, so transactions were not active. The asking prices for delivery to factories were 2.2 million yuan and 2.23 million yuan. The warehouse prices were 2.11 million yuan, 2.115 million yuan, 2.12 million yuan, and 1.13 million yuan. Zhengzhou Fine Velvet was 2.2 million yuan, Han Fine was 2.12 million yuan, Nantai Cang was 1.76 million yuan, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton was 320,000 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Also, China Fangjian Company traded a batch of domestic cotton with cotton merchants in the city yesterday, totaling more than 3,200 bales. The transaction prices were 2.15 million yuan for Jingyang Cotton, 2.14 million yuan for Lingbao Cotton, 1.98 million yuan for Hankou Fine Velvet, and 2.05 million yuan for Shashi Cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Also, the Shunheng Company's Steaming Vessel Lin Fan'er arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday, carrying more than 6,010 pieces of cotton, more than 540 bundles of steel plates and iron wires, more than 8,000 barrels of gasoline, diesel oil, and kerosene, more than 800 barrels of lubricating oil, and more than 1,100 bags of ink ash. Also, the Lai Company's Washington Liner arrived from the United States carrying 230,000 feet of lumber, 20 boxes of gold diamonds, and 73 pieces of machinery, which are equipment for factory bureaus to mine. Also, 29 tons of ink, 5 cars, 1 ambulance, totaling more than 800 tons.</p>
<p>Purchasing Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding foreign cotton that has not obtained an import license, the Central Trust Bureau has long been ordered to purchase it. It is learned that importers holding this foreign cotton have requested the Central Trust Bureau to exchange cotton for yarn to compensate for their foreign exchange losses. The Central Trust Bureau has specially appointed Zhang Xu, deputy manager of the Bureau's Purchasing Department, to go to the capital to attend the meeting of the Four Joint Offices to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Central Trust Bureau Issues Statement on Distribution of Rayon; Representatives of the Silk Weaving Industry Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau issued a statement yesterday regarding the Bureau's distribution of rayon:</p>
<p>(1) Distribution Method: This is still what the personnel in charge of the Bureau have been fighting for. The Bureau has always adopted auction or bidding methods for the sale of various government materials. The fact that the Bureau is still maintaining the distribution method for rayon means that the original distributors have already been given the right of priority distribution. If there is still dissatisfaction with this distribution method, the Bureau will be forced to change to auction or bidding methods for sale.</p>
<p>(2) Price Issue: When the Bureau started distributing rayon last year, the distribution price was originally adjusted dynamically according to the market. The fact that the distribution price had once remained unchanged for a period of time was due to the time-consuming process of requesting the Executive Yuan to adjust the silk price. After the Executive Yuan approved the Bureau to handle it at its discretion, the adjustment began. The adjustment method is that the personnel in charge of the Bureau consult and set the distribution price for the following week based on the average market price of rayon for one week, and with reference to the market price on the last day of one week, and then reducing it by 10 percent.</p>
<p>(3) The Silk Weaving Factories Claim: If the silk is woven at the current distribution price, the factories will be forced to shut down due to rising costs. In fact, in the previous months, the Bureau's rayon distribution was once interrupted due to a shortage of rayon, and no silk weaving factories were heard to have shut down. The claim that the distribution of silk will cause shutdowns is self-defeating. As for the silk weaving factories' claim that the payment for the Bureau's distribution of goods must be paid one week in advance, if there is any inconvenience, they can propose improvements and the Bureau will be happy to consider accepting them.</p>
<p>Also, representatives of the silk weaving industry went to the Municipal Government yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu to petition. Yesterday afternoon, a small group meeting was held in the industry association to submit a document to the Municipal Government stating the current difficulties of the manufacturers, requesting a reasonable reduction in the distribution price to facilitate production. If necessary, they will go to Nanjing to petition, and it was decided that from today onwards, all factories will automatically stop buying rayon on the black market. If the original silk cannot be sold, they would rather be forced to stop work completely.</p>
<p>Slight Fluctuations in Rayon Market Price</p>
<p>Also, the Central Trust Bureau's distribution list for rayon has been sent to the Silk Weaving Industry Association, but because the issue of requesting a reduction in the distribution price has not been resolved, the payment has not been made. The market price fluctuated slightly yesterday. The price of 120-count Gaoshan and Asahi, etc., with gloss, was 25 million yuan in the morning and 25.2 million yuan in the afternoon, 200,000 yuan less than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory operators said that the actual sales were very light, and yesterday the market price was slightly tired. Grade C was asking for 29.2 million yuan, but there were few takers. Gao Zero Lot had a slight transaction, priced at 28.5 million yuan. 28-count Dry Warp had orders asking for 18 million. Net Goods were also tired. Huatong Bedspread opened at 10.456 million yuan, and the closing price was 480,000 yuan. Dacheng Bedspread closed at 10.478 million yuan, and the closing price was 500,000 yuan for the spot price. Checked crepe was asking for 34,000 yuan, and there were buyers, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Discusses Reducing the Distribution Price</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau went to the private residence of President Zhang of the National Bank the night before last to discuss the rayon matter. President Zhang agreed to find a way. Yesterday morning, Bureau Director Wu Rencang of the Central Trust Bureau exchanged opinions with Wu again. Wu hoped that the Central Trust Bureau could understand the difficulties of the merchants and reduce the distribution price, according to the previous percentage increase, limited to 50% of the previous distribution price of 9.6 million per box. Wu Rencang asked the Social Affairs Bureau to forward the document submitted by the silk weaving industry to the Central Trust Bureau for further consultation and decision.</p>
<p>According to Wu Kaixian's statement to reporters: The silk weaving industry itself is in a recession. If the government wants to maintain it, it should find a way to reduce costs. This is not only related to commodity prices, but also to the survival of silk weaving factories. The rayon of the Central Trust Bureau is shipped from Japan and is a sole business. The cost per box is 190 US dollars. If you add freight, tariffs, and insurance, and settle in the black market, the cost is only 4.5 million per box. If you settle at the official price of 12,000, it is even cheaper. The current distribution price per box is 23.6 million, which is too high. The Social Affairs Bureau cannot ignore the suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors, so it hopes that the Central Trust Bureau can reduce the distribution price to not exceed 50% of the increase in the previous distribution price. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the reasons given by the silk weaving industry are reasonable, and can prove to the Central Trust Bureau that the silk weaving industry is currently in a dire situation due to high costs and difficult production and sales. The current problem for each factory is not how much money to make, but whether to survive.</p>
<p>Frequent Pressure from the Short Side; Lackluster Trading in Shanghai Stocks</p>
<p>Shanghai stocks were rampant with short selling yesterday due to the roll-over effect. Yongsha stabilized and then succumbed, trading decreased, and the market was bleak. Small stocks were relatively stable. Qinxing was unwilling to succumb and suddenly made a comeback. The price was forced to the limit in the middle of the session, and the market sentiment was slightly affected. The process was the most stable at this time. However, new buying was insufficient, and the market was finally overwhelmed by the short side at the close. Xinhe's last day of trading was lower than the current trading price, forming an inversion.</p>
<p>The opening was mixed. Yongsha opened at 239 yuan, and was sold at 232, 234, 238.5, and 232.07. The market side also sold, falling to 222 yuan. After 222.04 was sold, it suddenly advanced. 222.18 also accepted the current Yongsha. 222.23 and 221.67 also advanced, once rising to 228 yuan. 222.76, 222.65, 222.84, 222.83, and 222.60 continued to sell, and 222.50 and 222.23 also sold the current Yongsha, retreating to around 224 yuan and struggling. The situation was very mediocre.</p>
<p>After 10:30, Qinxing suddenly emerged. 193 and 188 strongly bought, repeatedly forcing the price to the 80.4 yuan limit. As a result, the retail investors were slightly agitated. Yongsha was accepted at the current price by 104, and 116 and 218 advanced to deliver. At the same time, 36 also worked hard to cover the current Yongsha, and once rose back to 228 yuan. 14, 224, 232, 235, and 78 took the opportunity to sell, and the price remained subdued.</p>
<p>After 11:30, 224 and 163 strongly sold the current Yongsha, forcing the price down to the low price of 219 yuan for both roll-over. As a result, Xinguang's current and roll-over were inverted, and so was Xinhe. Because Xinhe's roll-over trading was done until that day, 14 and 23 took the opportunity to buy the current Yongsha cheaply, and 157 and 24 covered the roll-over, and the noon close was at 230 yuan and 222 yuan.</p>
<p>After the close, 190's fierce supply made the last asking price for roll-over Yongsha as low as 220 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, the current shares were Yongsha, Meiya, and Hua, Xinguang and Yonggong fell slightly, Zhongfa and Jingfu rose slightly, Xinhua rose by 50% strongly, Qinxing rose by 50%, and Xinhe fell by 50% strongly. Zhongfang Innerwear was flat, Datong, Zhongs, Rongfeng, Matches, and Cement fell slightly, Tongyi fell, and Jinglun rose by 50% weakly. The roll-over shares were Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu fell slightly, and Huafeng and Xinhe fell by about 50%. The old shares outside the market were quite peaceful.</p>
<p>Great China Matches Implements Capital Increase, Temporarily Suspended Trading Starting August 15</p>
<p>Jointly Operated Factories Actively Promote Expansion of Southeast Asian Market; Working Day and Night to Produce Exported Cotton Textiles</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Marketing Joint Operation Company: Regarding the issue of raw material supply for the promotion of finished products in Southeast Asia, the person in charge of the company has reached a settlement with China Fangjian Company, and it can be allocated continuously in the short term, which is deeply gratifying. However, there is only one week left before the opening of Japan, and if the planned export products cannot be shipped as scheduled, domestic cotton textiles will inevitably lag behind the arrival of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia. The advantages and disadvantages of this are self-evident. The various factories under the company are purely private industries. They started to establish a joint operation mechanism under the stimulus of the opening of Japan's foreign trade, which is a sign that China's industry has begun to unite. Although the allocation of raw materials and funds to the various manufacturers participating in the company is relatively late, they are working day and night to rush production, so that a part of it can be exported before the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stabilize</p>
<p>Government bonds turned mediocre yesterday, with Bingwu rising slightly and miscellaneous brands flat. Turnover also decreased to around 4 million. Unified Bing opened at 10300 yuan, and advanced from 552 and 550 to 11000</p>
<h3>Illegal Tax Collection: Fan Xinwei Arrested</h3>
<p>[Reported by our Suzhou office on the 6th] Fan Xinwei, the head of the Huqiu branch of the Suzhou Tax Bureau, was today transferred to the District Procuratorate by the county government for illegally collecting taxes. The court immediately opened the trial, which lasted three hours, and ordered his detention.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Suzhou Grain Bureau, with the collection of actual grain about to begin this year, is devising methods to reform the malpractice of tax evasion as soon as possible. A sound plan has been drafted and will be implemented as soon as it is approved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding special criminal cases such as banditry and opium, which were previously subject to military law under the Emergency Measures for Pacification Zones, the Ministry of Justice recently presented to the Executive Yuan for approval that cases of banditry and opium outside war zones be transferred to judicial trial. However, military legal institutions at all levels have not yet received orders to transfer jurisdiction, making the transfer difficult. The extent of their authority is therefore crucial to the severity of sentencing, which is of great concern to society. Our reporter specifically visited the Suzhou High Court to inquire. According to reports, in order to seek coordination between the two sides, the Suzhou judicial community does not intend to demand immediate transfer based on the ministerial order. However, if the parties voluntarily submit to judicial trial and apply for retrial, they will decide to apply for retrial to the military authorities at any time in accordance with the Retrial Law, as a compromise.</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Guangxi Border: Thousands of Seeds of Malignant Tumors, Zhang Zai's Wife Leads Bandits in Raiding Homes</h3>
<p>[Reported from our Wuzhou office] From Luchuan and Bobai counties in Guangxi to Lingshan, Qin County, Fangcheng, Lianjiang, and Hepu in Guangdong, and extending to the Leizhou area, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi collectively call it "Nanlu" (Southern Road). In the past, the treacherous bandits of Nanlu hid in the mountain forests along the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, learning in Guangdong and fleeing north into Guangxi, or being suppressed in Guangxi and fleeing south into Guangdong. Further west were the tri-border areas of Guangxi-Vietnam and Guangdong-Vietnam, which were easily exploited by criminals. Furthermore, a group of "lobbyists" with organizational skills became guests of honor, attracting and gathering people, thus forming a semi-political, semi-savage force. Add to this some young students who are "ahead of the curve" adding fuel to the fire. Under these "favorable conditions", the Guangdong-Guangxi border began to rapidly conceal thousands of seeds of malignant tumors, causing turmoil and plunging the people into misery, eventually attracting the deep attention of the government.</p>
<p>Large quantities of new weapons were distributed</p>
<p>Under suppression, bandits often quickly dispersed and went to ground, appearing to be law-abiding and minding their own business. Government troops cannot randomly kill one or two of them without evidence, and so they are released. The local militia is still weak. Whether in Guangdong or Guangxi, when bandits come with great momentum, they are often intimidated by the bandit forces and dare not attack, which contributes to local disasters. Having learned this lesson, the authorities have decided to strengthen local military equipment. Recently, a batch of new light and heavy weapons has been distributed, including submachine guns, rocket launchers, light and heavy machine guns, and large quantities of ammunition. If we say that using such troops and weapons to deal with some insignificant petty bandits, it can only be said that the political significance far outweighs the military significance. The situation seems to be moving towards superficial stability due to the increase in military force. Heavy troops are stationed on the Guangdong-Guangxi border - from Luchuan to Panlong and Shijiao, where a large number of security forces are stationed. The situation in Guangxi has been relatively calm for several months. Although bandits in Guangdong are still rampant in rural areas, their rampant momentum has slightly subsided recently. In order to seek a permanent solution, local officials have convened emergency security meetings, gathering local gentry and grassroots cadres from the entire region and county to discuss fundamental solutions. They all believe that only a political solution can eradicate the root of the problem. Therefore, General Lin Ying also gave instructions, on the one hand to save the fallen villages and quickly restore them, and on the other hand to severely punish derelict cadres. At the same time, he mobilized student organizations to form large-scale propaganda teams to go to the countryside to promote the policy of conversion. Recently, anti-bandit propaganda rallies have been held successively in various places.</p>
<p>Female bandit leads her troops to occupy the mountains</p>
<p>Just as there are male "bandits", there are also female "bandits." In the Lingshan area west of Guinan, Zheng Kunyi, the wife of Zhang Yan—a famous general of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War who was executed in Yulin, Guangxi in 1944 for "delaying military opportunities"—led more than 2,000 of her former troops to occupy the mountains, raiding homes and "liberating" the pockets of the people, becoming a die-hard faction of the Chinese Communist Party in South China. Xinhua Daily praised her as a "female hero." This is an interesting episode in the turbulent situation.</p>
<p>When the people are suffering endlessly and disasters are ravaging the entire Guangxi, this "granary of Guangxi" cannot escape the floods. The vast fertile plains are covered with water. From Yulin to Wuzhou, the losses are incalculable, especially in Cenxi and Wuzhou. The fields around the city are all submerged. Wuzhou is located at the confluence of the Pearl River and the Gui River. The floodwaters have completely submerged the entire city. The reporter is staying in a high-rise hotel and has to travel on the overpasses, climbing directly to Beishan to overlook the entire city. The vast mirage makes one sigh at the lack of pity from Heaven! (3rd)</p>

<h3>Municipal Primary and Secondary School Principals Held Meeting Yesterday, Deciding on Tuition Fees for Next Semester, Junior High Tuition and Fees 220,000, Senior High 270,000, Primary School Construction Fee Including Fees 120,000</h3>
<p>[Reported by our office] The municipal primary and secondary school principals' meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the Pudong Building and Aurora University, respectively, and was presided over by Director Gu, Deputy Director Li, Director Xie, and Director Zhu of the Education Bureau. Details are recorded as follows: (A) Municipal secondary school principals' meeting, attended by more than ten municipal secondary school principals, resolved: (1) The tuition fee standard for the next semester was decided not to be increased, and will still be collected according to the standard of 20,000 for junior high and 30,000 for senior high. Miscellaneous fees are 54,000, health fees are 6,000, supplementary renovation fees are 120,000 for junior high and 160,000 for senior high, and compensation reserve fees are 20,000, totaling 220,000 for junior high and 270,000 for senior high, each being the highest amount. The fees charged by each school shall not exceed this standard, and it is stipulated that the fee collection date is from August 25th to September 5th. (2) The salaries of newly hired teachers in each school will be paid from September, according to convention. (3) The standards for board and lodging fees and specialist school fees will be resolved by a separate small group meeting; the deposit for normal school students is set at 20,000. (B) Municipal primary school principals' meeting, attended by more than 70 municipal primary school principals, resolved: (1) The request previously submitted by each municipal primary school to add classes has been approved by the municipal government to add 192 classes (including 64 newly established schools), and another 100 classes are reserved as birthday celebration schools. When there are no difficulties with housing facilities, they can be appropriately increased. (2) The children in the rural national education classes should strive for normalization and implement full-day classes. The national education classes and civil education classes run by public and private schools in the urban area have achieved remarkable results in the previous semester, and it is planned to expand and promote them further in the next semester. (3) The fee standard for the next semester, after detailed discussion and wide solicitation of opinions, was decided to be 80,000 for construction fees and 40,000 for miscellaneous fees (including 4,000 for health fees). The above fees are also the highest amounts, and each school shall not exceed them when collecting fees. The cost of books will be determined separately and is a service fee, not compulsory. According to Director Gu, in order to reduce the burden on parents and based on the principle of building the nation through education, the Education Bureau has made every effort to reduce the fees for municipal schools.</p>
