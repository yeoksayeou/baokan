<h3>美政府將要求國會撥款三億美元援華　詳細計劃下週即可提出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十一日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾國務　今日在兩院外交委員會中繼續　請　速援助曾遭兵　各國。渠稱：政府要求國會以美金約三億元援助中國。馬歇爾謂，據美國佔計，中國每月需要美金約二千萬美元，　示美國之援助將延長至十五個月之時期，對華第一批援助，預定為六千萬美元。馬卿發言時，副國務　洛維特坐於其旁，洛氏謂援華數額，僅屬約數。據悉，此項數額之規定，與日下尙未發表之　德　報吿　，顯有關係。</p>
<p>（路透社華盛頓十日電）副國務鄉洛雜特今晶宣稱：政府將於十一月十七日向國會特別會議提出援助中國之詳細計劃，此一計劃之目的，在穩定中國經濟，並非爲完成若歐州之大規模建設計　，此間盛傳援華額為十五億美元，洛氏對此一數字柜絕發表意見。</p>
<p>（中央社華盛頓十日電）美衆院議長馬丁，及衆議員周以德等共和黨領袖，均贊成將援華計劃列入國會特別會議之討論事項中。</p>
<p>（本報南京十一日電）政院新聞局長董顯光宣稱：「中國人民對於馬歇爾國務　宣吿美政府正準備經濟援華之確切計劃，以便及早提出議會一節，甚爲欣慰，中國緊急之情况，已為美政府所充分認識，我政府對此頗予注視」。</p>
<p>（本報南京十一日電）權成人士頃評馬歇爾國務　在美參，衆兩院外委會聯席會議中宣稱「渠正草擬一確切之經濟援華計劃，俾便早日提出國會之報吿」稱：馬鄉並未說明援華計劃是否將於本月十七日提出國會特別會議，而此種含混之宣布，實有興趣之行動。當前美國朝野人士對援華之立塲，顯有兩派，一派主張立即全面援華，以援歐計劃與援華計劃並置於國會考慮下，俾美國在東·西兩方採取平衡安全之政策，此派主張包括司徒大使·魏德邁·蒲立特·范登堡·馬丁·周以德諸人之全部或一部意見。另派主張先行援歐，以對付蘇聯在東歐勢力之擴張，而於援華則稍候時日。馬　此種意見之決定原因，這使其中歐計劃之龐火支出得在國會獲得順利支持，此兩派意見之分歧，自　立特「訪華觀感」問世一月來，極爲明顯，且已在與論界成爲領導民意之有力因素。主張立即援華人士，對馬歇爾·杜魯門不健康之單面政策之猛烈攻擊，使馬鄉不得不在國會外委會聯席會中先爲說項，以爲緩和之計，然此種策略是否可使反對派沉默並停止彼等促成將援華計劃與援歐計劃並提國會之活動，殊難預料。現距國會特別會開會尙有一週，馬　究將利用此適常時問於說服反對派，抑趕速草擬完成其「確切之援華計劃」。將於此一週中由反對派意見之堅持與否及馬　進一援華保證之有無，作最後決定。該人士認美國物價將於其對外援助之數量上有所影響，而不致撼動其基本原則，如馬　爲爭取援歐數量而稽延援華計劃之提出，實乃欠公正者。</p>
<h3>周以德在美談話　目前遠東局勢如不改觀蘇聯將不流血控制全亞</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕共和黨衆議員周以德，考察中國與日木事畢返此，今日宣稱：麥帥之最大煩惱　爲中國局勢，　在日本時承其見告，謂共黨如果控制中國，美在日木與朝鮮之計劃必不能成功。麥帥在日本工作艱鉅，令人幾難置信，但渠完全認識中國局勢。日本與朝鮮方面工作無論如何美滿，茍不使中共受抑制，則仍不免功虧一簣。中國目前局勢，由於共產黨得寸進尺，恰與半年前之希臘相同。美國拒絕支持中國國民政府，已使整個遠東計劃瀕於危境，或將不可救　，本人已將此意連同建談通知國務　馬歡爾，馬氏去年以駐華特使地位，企圖促成國共和解，此舉未免不智，蓋美國保守中立，共產黨依然繼續擭得援助，而吾人則拒絕援助中國盟友。又謂局勢如不改觀，蘇聯將毋須流血即控制亞洲全部。美國雖擊敗日本，但勝利屬諸蘇聯。就現狀而論，美軍退出日本，適足將該國拱手讓予共產黨，蓋日本無論在麥　管理下如何民主，共產黨一旦控制中國，日本亦必不能維持其民主。日本經濟前途與中國關係密切，中國方面並未完全失望，但吾人對華必須推行一種切實計劃。</p>
<h3>援華重於援歐塔虎特發表演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十一日電〕美國共和黨總統競選人參議員塔虎特十一日在紐約奧海渥州協會宴席上發表演說，對馬歇爾計劃及國務院不公布魏德邁報吿一節大事批評。氏稱：美國在考慮援歐前，應先考慮援華之建議，渠詢稱：「魏德邁報吿在那裏？除非吾人同時考慮援華之建議及吾人在南美洲之責任，吾人不應考慮歐洲。」氏强調魏德邁報吿被留中不發，成爲政府之最大秘密，並詢問「誰知道這些是什麼？」</p>

<h3>明年度預算草案　財政部決定不編制　留待行憲後立法院決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財次徐柏園表示：明年度之預算，應由行憲後之立法院決定，其起草工作固仍由財部負，但當由立法院先指示方針。明年度之預算草案，財部決定不編製，而擬將今年度之預算延長三個月，以待行憲。據徐次長之個人看法，明年度預算內將有改革　制之考慮，財政之開源方面，現正多方設計，惟如何能减省不必要之支出，亦至關重要。</p>

<h3>國父誕辰紀念感言</h3>
<p>在全國行將舉行普選的今日，我們又逢到了國父的　辰；除了熱烈慶祝而外，我們緬懷國父誕生八十一年以來的歷史，再展望我國建國復興的前程，眞是感　多端，不知從何說起。國父爲革命奮鬥了四十年，爲的就是救亡與建國；他的一生，始終燃燒着愛國救世的熱情，倡導革命建國的三民主義，艱苦奮鬥，不怕艱險，不避危難，以至大至剛的精神，領導國民革命，直到臨終的一刹那，猶不忘「和平，奮鬥，救中國。」今天我國在抗戰勝利以後，備受共匪的擾亂，使建國工作大受打擊，我們後死者對於　國父在天之靈，只有深深　感到悲愧。在國父逝世之後，假定大家都能照國父的精神去幹，「和平，奮鬥，救中國」，那末三民主義的新中國，早可出現於我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>我們紀念國父誕辰，首先要明瞭國父致力國民革命四十年的目的，不僅在求中國的自由平等，而且也要謀得中國政治經濟的民主化。全國人民受了國父革命精神的感召，在蔣主席領導之下，艱苦抗戰了八年，終於獲得了勝利，解除了百年來不平等條約的束縛，可謂已達成國父民族主義的目的；但是在勝利之後，因爲共能問題的接踵而起，勝利沒有帶來和平與光明，反而帶來了新的糾紛，以致今日全國各地都在戰亂狀態之下。因此，國父所提倡的民權主義，目前固尙有待於推行，而民生主義的實施，尤其感到幾乎尙未着手。中國在表面上看來，好似已綠自由平等了，但是按之實際，內在的危機日見深刻，我們若不能秉承　父的遺志，加倍努力實行三民主義，則我國仍有亡國滅種危險。我們稍一硏究內在危機深化的原因，就不難明瞭其癥結乃在共匪的問題，而共匪之所以成爲問題，固由於無產階級專政現論之作祟，可是政治的未盡淸明，民生的日趨凋敝，終究是培養共匪的重要因素。蔣主席旣一再昭示國人，要集中一切力量，加緊進行剿匪的工作，我們就該有種要求政府痛切革除病民的秕政，肅淸殃民的貧官，以杜絕製造共匪之來源，同時我們也有責任，喚起全民消滅共匪，以爲建國斬除荆棘。</p>
<p>其次，我們要與剿縣同時進行的，就是憲政的實施與民生主義的推行。國民政府去年十一月十五日毅然召開國民大會，完成我國制憲的偉大事業，並定於本年十二月廿五日實施，離今僅有四五十天了，全國刻正積極準備普選。這是我國實施憲政的開端，也就是我國人民行使四權的第一步。所謂「作事愼於始謀」，不論是行使選擧權的人民，或是競選的人士，都應該特別愼重。在人民，應該特別珍重自已的一票，不僅要踴躍參加投票，而且還要自由表示自己的意志，不受利誘，也不屈於威脅。在競選者，更要特別注意政治的道德，學習民主國家的作風，千萬不能用非法手段，以求達個人的私欲。人民行使四權，是國父民權主義的特色，而在四權之中，以選擧權爲言，我們今天行使選擧權，自應特別愼重將將事。以言民生主義的推行，我國在八年抗戰期間，受了敵人的摧毀，早已精疲力　，在勝利之後，又無休養生息的機會，到今天實已有「民不聊生」之　。政府尤尤應當機立斷，毅然實施新政，使久受壓迫曾不能一得溫飽的農民得以稍蘇喘息，更進而實行平均地權的政策，使他們能自有其耕地。我們相信，政府常局如果篤信三民主義，——尤其是民生主義，而貫之以毅力，則大多數農民得了生機，傾心擁護，共匪縱欲利誘威迫，農民亦必望望然去之，何致甘受欺騙，終為工具？故剿匪的軍事行動，必須配合着針對農村的新政策，解除農民痛苦，方能收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>最後，我們應知中國雖不幸而遭逢內亂，但是中國在國際上仍處非常重要的地位，中國實在有極可樂觀的光明前程；不要說全國上下應有此共同信念，就是各友邦也莫不盼望中國能成爲一强大的，統一的，民主的新中國。强大，統一，民主，可謂我國今後努力唯一的方針。我們前天看了英文大美晚報社論「中華聯邦國」的一文中，所引某外人的意見，高談闊論中國政制，竟有劃分中國爲二個三個國家的分治謬論，不能不提高國人的特別警惕了。中國必須統一，才能强大；亦唯有統一而强大的中國，才能有助於遠東的和平或世界的和平。反之，任何分割中國的方案，不管是怎麽好的幻想，只有削弱中國的力量，構成禍害世界的因素。國父對於中央集權與地方分權，均表不滿，因而首創均權制，折衷至當，可謂反對聯省制最烈的一人。今天我們紀念國父誕辰，對於這些藥不對症的謬說，不能不乘便加以糾正。</p>

<h3>若干美商缺乏信用　港進口行怨聲載道</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港十一日電〕遠東經濟評論報十一日載稱，若干香港與中國之美貨進口商，頃對美國出口商近所運出之商品往往與合同中之條件及種類不符一事，怨聲載道。商人之怨恨多集中於不能恢復之信用書制度上，蓋美商在其貨物抵達目的地前，即可向銀行取得貸款。定貨人發現貨物與合同不符或係次貨時，提出伸訴已太遲。該文幷列擧各事實於后：</p>
<p>向美國定購每箱二百八十隻至二百二十隻之大號橘子，而到貨時每箱竟有三百三十隻至三百四十五隻之小橘，致賣價不俏，故進口商受損匪淺。</p>
<p>定購之玻璃品及透明木梳，在到貨時發現乃賽璐珞製品。</p>
<p>所訂購之出名老牌之汽車胎，在貨品抵達時竟爲不出名牌子之次貨。</p>
<p>百分之三百强度之顏料，牴達時竟有百分之一百至一百五十度，與定貨時之包裝及脾名均相異。</p>
<p>該文又指出亞洲買主多認購老牌子之貨物，故進口商常因新貨而遭損虧。</p>
<p>進口商雖有騐關員所簽置之證件，寄與美國時多不予置答。若經由美領事館追究此事，則費時過多。</p>

<h3>范特堡質問援歐計劃　馬歇爾續有說明　本會計年度內需款二十六億餘美元　强調應使德國自給自足</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紐約十一日廣播：華盛頓訊，在參院外委會主席范登堡質詢之下，馬歇爾答稱：據渠佔計，美國之對外援助之總數，在截至明年六月卅日止之會計年度中，約需二十六億五千七百萬美元，此項款項，將分成對奧地利，法國，義大利三國之緊急援助五億九千七百萬美元，美國佔領各區車費五千萬美元，馬歇爾計劃第一批正式援助十五億美元，以及對華首批援助六千萬美元。</p>
<p>在范登堡繼續質詢之下，馬氏又稱，對希土援助或須再予增加，惟本會計年度內不致提出。馬氏力言美國必須使德國自給自足，惟以不致恢復其作戰能力爲條件。渠對其他國家指責美國企圖使德國重振軍備之說，力予否認，指之爲歪曲事實。渠謂恢復德國經濟之目的，第一爲使戰敗國不致繼續爲美國之負担，第二，可有助於整個歐洲之經濟復興。馬氏言，顯係對蘇聯前曾在外長會議中所作之指責而發。范登堡復提出質問，詢以美國發動之歐洲四年復興計劃，是否將在東西之間樹立壁壘？馬氏答稱：美蘇間之現行關係母需詳述，但渠認爲前途尚有「希望」，此種分裂不致成爲永久的。馬氏對於德國問題，尤爲重視，認為歐洲安危，實繫於此。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十日電〕塔虎特自稱贊成「合理」之援歐，惟反對龐大之支出。渠坦白稱：國會特別會議啟幕時，渠將要求將爲歇爾計劃之一切部門及結果，加以縝密研究及辯論。渠稱：杜魯門政府經過國際銀行，榨得四十億元，以貸給英国，並爲進出口銀行榨得基金，且將三十億元助與聯總，而此等款項之大部已被浪費。塔虎特提出對馬歇爾計劃四大反對意見：　依歐洲受援國自定之援助規模，明年美國將加征八十億元新稅，實屬危險至極。　出口過多，必將發生通貨膨脹。塔氏指斥政府在國外浪費以</p>
<p>維持美國之高經濟水準，並警告稱：如此經濟定將崩潰，一九三〇年之不景氣前車可鑑。　馬歇爾計劃能否產生預計之效果？塔氏稱：美國過於重視金元之重要性，歐洲國家對共產主義之迎拒在於理想，而不在美國之借款。　出口過多，戰時管制將應運復活。渠認物價管制之恢復爲美國承平時代之大不幸，馬歇爾計劃雖可能獲得利益，並不足加以抵消。</p>
<h3>緊急援歐法案細則　美政府提交國會　對歐洲貨幣穩定基金尚未決定</h3>
<p>（路透社華盛頓十日電〕國務院十日向國會委員會提出緊念援歐之詳細立法案，根據該一法案，法國將獲得一億一千萬元之小要，三百萬元之牛乳產品，二千萬元之油脂，一億一千六百萬元之美國煤斤，九百萬元之德國煤斤，二千二百萬元之石油產品，三千八百萬元之棉花，九百萬元之肥料；奧國將獲二千萬元之糧食，一千三百萬元之煤斤，七百萬元之種子及肥料，二百萬元之醫藥用品；義大利將獲一億二千八百萬元之　物，一千二百萬元之油脂，五百萬元之大豆，二百萬元之牛乳產品，三千六百萬元之美國煤斤，一千萬元之德國煤斤，一千三百萬元之石油產品？一千九百萬元之農業供應，包括肥料等，二百萬元醫藥用品。美國將與法，義，奧成立個別協定，以使其充分利用救濟物資，供救濟及建設之用，並責成受惠國充分宣揚美國之援助意志，受惠國有破壞此條件者，總統有權下令停止援助。</p>
<p>（路透社華盛頓十日電）副國務卿洛維特在記者招待會中稱：巴黎經濟合作會議建議以三十億元作爲歐洲貨幣穩定基金，國務院於此尚無決議。洛氏此項聲明係於馬歇爾向兩院外委會宣佈其援外計劃後發表。洛氏謂：義大利最近數週之急需，將移用已核准之聯德結束後對奧救濟項下之款項。</p>
<h3>英歡迎陶格拉斯執行馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>（合眾社倫敦十日電）據華盛頓十日傳出美駐英大使陶格拉斯可能被選爲馬歇爾計劃之執行人之訊抵達此間後，外交部對此表示歡迎。外交部發言人稱：哈里曼之報告正在審愼研究中。</p>
<h3>歐洲二十一國關稅會議揭幕</h3>
<p>（路透社布魯塞爾十日電）討論歐洲關稅同盟之二十一國研討會議，已於十日再此舉行首次會議。會議之召集爲荷，比，盧三國，印度，巴基斯坦，南菲，加拿大，澳洲，紐西蘭亦均派觀察員列席。比總理史巴克致開會辭，謂歐洲經濟同盟之促成，須以合作及犧牲之需要爲基礎。</p>
<h3>傳蘇曾試驗第一枚原子彈</h3>
<p>（路透社巴黎十一日電）巴黎晚報記者自莫斯科經由普拉格發出電報稱，蘇聯之第一枚原子彈，已於今年六月十五日在西伯里亞荒僻處爆炸、當時在塲者有蘇炸彈專家二百五十名及若干政府官員，距試投地最近之城市為距具加爾湖南端五十哩·外義邊界一百四十哩之伊爾庫次京城。該彈乃一小型彈，重僅十三磅，然效能俱全，周　卅公里以內，均感覺爆炸效果。該記者並曰，渠自極端機密方面獲知，蘇原子專家承認蘇聯在原子彈製造方面較為美國落後五年。</p>
<p>「路透社倫數十一日電」與英外部接近人士對上項傳說，表示懷疑，認爲或係外長會前夕蘇聯麥帥關懷美援華諾言</p>
<h3>日本經濟前途　擊於中國局勢　麥師關懷美援華諾言</h3>
<p>（聯合社東京十一日電〕聯合社今日獲悉，麥師會向新近來日訪問者稱，日本在政治上級經濟上均與亞洲思想戰之結果息息相關。今南韓已陷入共產黨勢力，中國之命運則尚未定。麥帥承認亞洲面突之形勢嚴重，並曾表示蘇聯勢力可能向南方侵入，直至海濱。</p>
<p>美國務卿之援華諾言，無疑將博得此間外人及日人之有力援助。日本再目前雖未亞洲最平安國家，但被牽向遠東騷亂之頂點，已相去漸近。麥師及其發言人近，嘗力言日本之經濟前途擊於亞洲，尤其是中國，此為日本之天然市場，日本必須獲得充分對外貿易，以維持其每年所需百分之十五至二十之食糧進口，此則以中國維其主要因素，蘇聯如能控制亞洲大陸之大部份，則其對日本所處之地位，將與其在東歐對德國所處之地位相等。政治侵潤，可隨經濟動＃之比奉加速，而藉日高度組織化之共黨槍頭進行。</p>
<p>朝鮮危機未許樂觀</p>
<p>對於南韓情形，亦約略相似，惟日本在經濟上依賴南韓較少。此間一部份外交家對朝鮮亦與麥帥同抱悲觀，認為北韓之蘇聯組織，可於美軍撤退以後，直接達半島尖端。但據麥帥表示，確信美國偉大之空軍與太平洋基地，可粉碎對日本之任何侵略企圖，而限制蘇聯勢力於大陸，麥帥會宣稱，蘇聯在亞州戰役中獲得陸地，而西方盟過則獲得海洋，此再太平洋將為蘇聯之軍事絕地。</p>
<h3>印接受珍那迦巴基斯坦抗議</h3>
<p>「路透射拉雷爾十日電」巴基斯坦斯為印度軍接受珍娜　那迦邦行政，已向印政府提抗議。</p>
<h3>對暹羅鑾披汶政權　中美持保留態度　暹新閣成立九十日內舉行大選</h3>
<p>「本報南京十一日電〕王外長今日在政務會議席上表示，關於　羅新政權問題，我政府暫持保貿態度。下午五時許，王外長會約　駐華大使杜拉了塞古安，聞對我在　僑胞安全與現存食米以及商民大選等事，均有所商洽。　使對該國政變，認係一革命行動，泰然處之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電）國務部今日宣稱：關於遷羅政府被傾覆一事，尚待更詳盡之報告，方能決定是否承認新政府問題。蓋鑾披汶被指爲戰時與日本合作者。</p>
<p>「路透社曼谷十一日電」　披　元帥取得政權後廿四小時，即於十日夜宣佈　羅將另行其一切對外國至義務。同時渠並任命一廿八人之軍事委員，自任為委員長，復任命二十人內閣，由阿　　為總理，後者於一九四四年日人佔領時曾任總理之職。前總理鑾丹龍及抗日領袖巴諾榮於事變後逃亡無鏦，料仍避匿曼谷。同時原有之攝政會已解散，代以最高國務會議。</p>
<p>（合衆社曼谷十一日電）　新內閣業於今日接管行政，阿斐璜在三年中，第三度出任總理，鑾披　自願推舉幕後操縱一切。軍政府決定解散國會，制定新憲法，規定在九十日內舉行大選。內閣其他新部長如後：</p>
<p>外長李亞伐卡，財長阿查揚親王，司法長普拉莫，內長錫納育哈拉中將，農長薛鐵豐親王，宣傳長　蘇孔代。</p>
<h3>蘇聯誣蔑英國艾德禮表不滿</h3>
<p>（聯合設倫敦十日電）艾德禮首相今日渝倫敦新市長威爾斯就職禮中演說，批評蘇聯指責英人爲帝國主義者及戰爭販子，艾氏稱，以一國政府官員對一友邦政府官員用此名稱，殊屬不遜。英國準許印度自治，緬甸獨立，均為並非帝國主義者之明證。</p>
<h3>英緊急預算案今日提交下院</h3>
<p>（路透社倫敦十一日電）財相　爾頓今日向內爾報告將於十二誒提出下議院之臨時進擊預算案該案主要目的在防止克服經濟危機計劃施行時之通貨膨脹，</p>
<h3>土耳其陸海軍　秋季大演習</h3>
<p>（路頭社伊斯坦埠十日電）土總理偕國防部長及陸軍將領多人，自安加拉抵此，參觀在士國特拉斯省及韃靼尼爾海峽舉行之陸海軍秋季大演習。</p>
<h3>明年五月一日前　英結束聖地委治　美蘇兩國代表獲致協議</h3>
<p>（聯合社成功湖十日電）關於巴勒斯坦分治問題蘇聯提案，美蘇兩國代表今日已商定折衷方案，即交聯大巴勒斯坦分治小組會審查。內容主張：</p>
<p>英國於明年五月一日前結束委任統治。　阿拉伯與猶太兩國之獨立，應於明年七月一日或可能較早之日期實現。　設立三人或五人委員會，委員由聯大推選小國代表組成之。該委會當負責主持委治結束後興獨立實現前之過度期內巴勒斯坦行政事宜。該團應在安理會指導下行使職權，每月提出報告一次。　在聯大會批准分治與委治結束之過渡時期內，英國對巴勒斯坦之法律治安與公用事業應繼續負責。</p>
<p>（合衆社成功湖面十日電）聯大政委會在痛斥蘇聯使用否決權阻止若干國家申請人會後，以壓倒多數之表決，要求安理會在本屆大會結束前，對義·奧·芬·葡·愛爾蘭·外約但之申請，重加審查。</p>

Marshall said that according to U.S. estimates, China needs approximately twenty million U.S. dollars per month, indicating that U.S. aid will be extended to a period of fifteen months, with the first batch of aid to China estimated at sixty million U.S. dollars. While Secretary Marshall was speaking, Under Secretary of State Lovett sat beside him. Lovett said that the amount of aid to China is only an approximation. It is understood that the stipulation of this amount is clearly related to the still unpublished Wedemeyer report.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 10th) Deputy Secretary of State Lovett announced today that the government will submit a detailed plan to Congress special session on November 17 to aid China. The purpose of this plan is to stabilize China's economy, not to complete a large-scale construction like that of Europe. It is widely rumored here that the amount of aid to China will be 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Lovett declined to comment on this figure.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Washington, 10th) U.S. House Speaker Martin and Republican leaders such as Congressman Judd are in favor of including the aid to China plan in the agenda of the special session of Congress.</p>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th) Director of the Information Department of the Executive Yuan, Tung Hsien-kuang, declared: "The Chinese people are very gratified that Secretary of State Marshall announced that the U.S. government is preparing a concrete plan for economic aid to China in order to submit it to Congress as soon as possible. The urgent situation in China has been fully recognized by the U.S. government, and our government is paying close attention to this."</p>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th) Authoritative sources recently commented on Secretary of State Marshall's announcement in the joint session of the U.S. Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees that "he is drafting a concrete plan for economic aid to China in order to submit a report to Congress as soon as possible," saying: Secretary Marshall did not specify whether the aid to China plan will be submitted to the special session of Congress on the 17th of this month, and this ambiguous announcement is indeed an interesting move. Currently, there are clearly two factions among American officials and the public regarding their stance on aiding China: one faction advocates immediate and comprehensive aid to China, placing the aid to Europe plan and the aid to China plan under consideration by Congress in order to adopt a balanced security policy in the East and West; this faction includes all or part of the opinions of Ambassador Stuart, Wedemeyer, Bullitt, Vandenberg, Martin, and Judd. The other faction advocates aiding Europe first to counter the expansion of Soviet power in Eastern Europe, while postponing aid to China. The reason for Secretary Marshall's decision on this opinion is to enable the huge expenditures of the aid to Europe plan to gain smooth support in Congress. The divergence of these two opinions has been extremely evident since the publication of Bullitt's "Impressions of a Visit to China" a month ago, and has become a powerful factor in leading public opinion in the journalistic community. The fierce attacks by those who advocate immediate aid to China on Marshall and Truman's unhealthy one-sided policy have forced Secretary Marshall to speak out in the joint session of the congressional foreign affairs committee in advance as a means of easing tensions. However, it is difficult to predict whether this strategy can silence the opposition and stop their efforts to promote the joint submission of the aid to China plan and the aid to Europe plan to Congress. With only one week left before the special session of Congress, whether Secretary Marshall will use this appropriate time to persuade the opposition or expedite the completion of his "concrete aid to China plan" will be finally determined in this week by the insistence of the opposition and the existence or absence of Secretary Marshall's further guarantee of aid to China. The source believes that American prices will be affected by the amount of its foreign aid, but will not shake its fundamental principles. If Secretary Marshall delays the submission of the aid to China plan in order to win the amount of aid to Europe, it is truly unfair.</p>
<h3>Judd's Speech in the United States: If the Current Situation in the Far East Does Not Change, the Soviet Union Will Control All of Asia Without Bloodshed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Republican Congressman Judd, having completed his investigation of China and Japan, declared today that MacArthur's greatest worry is the situation in China. He acknowledged having been told by MacArthur in Japan that if the Communists control China, America's plans in Japan and Korea will not succeed. MacArthur's work in Japan is arduous, almost unbelievable, but he fully understands the situation in China. No matter how perfect the work in Japan and Korea is, if the Chinese Communists are not contained, it will still be in vain. The current situation in China, with the Communists gaining ground inch by inch, is exactly the same as Greece half a year ago. The United States' refusal to support the Chinese National Government has endangered the entire Far East plan, or may be beyond salvation. I have notified Secretary of State Marshall of this intention along with my suggestions. Marshall's attempt to promote reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communists in his capacity as a special envoy to China last year was unwise, because the United States maintained neutrality, the Communists continued to receive assistance, while we refused to aid our Chinese allies. He also said that if the situation does not change, the Soviet Union will control all of Asia without bloodshed. Although the United States defeated Japan, the victory belongs to the Soviet Union. As it stands, the withdrawal of American troops from Japan is tantamount to handing the country over to the Communists, because no matter how democratic Japan is under MacArthur's administration, Japan will inevitably be unable to maintain its democracy once the Communists control China. Japan's economic future is closely related to China. China has not completely despaired, but we must implement a concrete plan for China.</p>
<h3>Aid to China is More Important Than Aid to Europe, Taft Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] Republican presidential candidate Senator Taft delivered a speech at the banquet of the Ohio State Association in New York on the 11th, criticizing the Marshall Plan and the State Department's failure to publish the Wedemeyer Report. He stated that the United States should consider the proposal to aid China before considering aid to Europe. He asked, "Where is the Wedemeyer Report? Unless we simultaneously consider the proposal to aid China and our responsibilities in South America, we should not consider Europe." He emphasized that the Wedemeyer Report was kept secret and became the government's biggest secret, and asked, "Who knows what these are?"</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Declines Candidacy, Formally Notified Central Party Headquarters; Negotiations on Democratic Socialist Party List Continue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] After reviewing the list of National Assembly delegate candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, where he was nominated as a candidate for Fenghua County, President Chiang today formally notified the Central Party Headquarters of his decision to decline. He reiterated the essence of his speech at the memorial week meeting this past Monday, saying: "Today, we should dedicate ourselves more to revolutionary responsibilities and focus on our duties. My responsibilities are numerous and important, and I have absolutely no desire to participate in the election, so that local public opinion can elect suitable local people or other comrades to serve as delegates, thus establishing a model of democracy."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's list of National Assembly delegate candidates made no progress on the 11th, and appears to have reached a deadlock. Xu Chuanlin stated his intention to visit Chairman Chiang to seek a decision. He believes that Chairman Chiang may not be fully aware of the Democratic Socialist Party's current demands and insistence. Therefore, he specifically contacted Wu Dingchang today to discuss the possibility of visiting the Chairman. Xu told reporters that if there is no hope for negotiation, he will return to Shanghai and decide to notify the branches in various provinces and cities not to participate in the National Assembly elections. However, he emphasized that this matter is unrelated to participation in the government. Xu repeatedly explained that if they do not participate in the National Assembly, it is imperative that Chairman Chiang and the outside world understand the truth. Jiang Yuntian, Zhan Yiqiao, Lei Zhen, and others returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 11th. The meeting between Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Junmai has also not yet reached a conclusion. It is only known that Zhang Junmai is now willing to reduce the original seventy-four candidates requiring adjustment by ten names, but cannot concede further. The Kuomintang, through Chen Lifu's negotiation, can only offer fifteen more names, so the gap remains considerable.</p>
<h3>Election Expenses for Next Year Still Included in Local Budgets; Deficits Supplemented by Central Government</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The legislative elections are about to begin. According to the regulations of the legislative election process, while the elections can be completed by the end of January of the thirty-seventh year, continued expenditure will be required after the beginning of the thirty-seventh year, which should therefore be supplemented by the central government. The National Government has recently approved this, and Chairman Chiang has approved the request to include the expenses, calculated according to actual monthly needs and original payment standards, in the general local revenue and expenditure budget of each province and city for the thirty-seventh year. If there is a deficit in the revenue and expenditure of each province and city budget, it will still be supplemented by the central government.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Expands Tax Police Corps; Training to Begin Next Month; Wen Yingxing Appointed Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, November 11th] Zhu Ziwen has begun to devote all his efforts to addressing the issue of public security in Guangdong Province. It has been learned that in terms of increasing security forces, in addition to expanding the existing security forces, Song Ziwen will separately establish ten tax police corps, using the original Sixth Tax Police Regiment stationed in Guangdong and the Seventh Regiment stationed in Guangxi as the foundation. The rest will be formed by recruiting strong young men. Training is scheduled to begin next month in Xiamao, and all expenses will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance. These ten tax police corps will later become the main force for public security in South China. Wen Yingxing will serve as the commander-in-chief. Wen has already arrived in Guangzhou from Shanghai. Yao Yuping, the chief supervisor of the Ministry of Finance's tax police training, also arrived in Guangzhou to discuss organizational training matters with Song Ziwen.</p>
<h3>Beitashan</h3>
<p>Geographers Prove Beyond Doubt That It Belongs to Our Territory</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, made a statement in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th regarding the attack by armed forces of the Mongolian People's Republic on the Beitashan area of our territory. He also refuted the Soviet claim that Beitashan is not within Chinese territory. Today, the reporter specifically visited Fu Jiaojin, a geographer and the current Director of the Fangyu (Territorial) Department of the Ministry of Interior, to request him to provide evidence from historical facts and documents regarding the border, in order to prove that Beitashan is indeed within the territory of China. Fu stated: Beitashan is also known as Beida Shan, Baitakeshan, or Baitashan. It is located northeast of Qitai County in Xinjiang Province of China, more than 600 li (approximately 300 kilometers) from the border of Outer Mongolia, approximately at 91 degrees 1 minute east longitude and 45 degrees 3 minutes north latitude. It is extremely clear that the mountain should be under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province, China. Fu then listed evidence from three aspects: relevant official documents regarding the Xinjiang-Mongolia border, historical records, and Chinese and foreign maps, proving that Beitashan is within the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province beyond any doubt.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday</h3>
<p>Today, as the entire country is about to hold general elections, we are once again celebrating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. In addition to celebrating enthusiastically, we recall the history since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth eighty-one years ago, and we look forward to the future of our country's founding and revival. We are truly filled with all sorts of emotions, and do not know where to begin. Dr. Sun Yat-sen fought for the revolution for forty years, for the sake of national salvation and nation-building. Throughout his life, he always burned with patriotic enthusiasm, advocated the Three Principles of the People for revolutionary nation-building, struggled arduously, feared no difficulties, and avoided no dangers. With a spirit of great righteousness and strength, he led the National Revolution until the very moment of his death, when he still did not forget "Peace, struggle, save China." Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, our country has suffered from the disturbances of the communist bandits, which has greatly impacted the work of nation-building. We, who are survivors, only feel deeply ashamed before Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, if everyone could have acted according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, "Peace, struggle, save China," then a new China based on the Three Principles of the People would have already appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>In commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we must first understand that the purpose of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of dedication to the National Revolution was not only to seek China's freedom and equality, but also to seek the democratization of China's political and economic systems. The people of the whole country, inspired by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, fought arduously for eight years under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and finally won the victory and lifted the shackles of unequal treaties that had existed for a century. It can be said that the goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism has been achieved. However, after the victory, due to the successive communist problems, the victory did not bring peace and light, but instead brought new disputes, so that today the whole country is in a state of war. Therefore, the Principle of Democracy advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen still needs to be promoted, and the implementation of the Principle of Livelihood is felt to be almost untouched. On the surface, China seems to have achieved freedom and equality, but in reality, the internal crisis is deepening day by day. If we cannot inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and work harder to implement the Three Principles of the People, then our country will still face the danger of national subjugation and extermination. If we study the reasons for the deepening of the internal crisis, it is not difficult to understand that the crux of the problem lies in the communist bandits. The reason why the communist bandits have become a problem is due to the harm caused by the theory of proletarian dictatorship. However, the lack of political integrity and the increasing impoverishment of the people are ultimately important factors in cultivating the communist bandits. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly told the people of the country that they must concentrate all their efforts to intensify the work of suppressing the bandits. We should demand that the government thoroughly eliminate the corrupt politics that harm the people and eliminate the corrupt officials who plague the people, in order to stop the source of communist bandits. At the same time, we also have the responsibility to awaken the whole people to eliminate the communist bandits in order to clear the thorns for nation-building.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we must carry out at the same time as suppressing the bandits is the implementation of constitutional government and the promotion of the Principle of Livelihood. The National Government resolutely convened the National Assembly on November 15th last year, completing the great undertaking of drafting a constitution for our country, and set it to be implemented on December 25th of this year, just forty or fifty days from now. The whole country is now actively preparing for general elections. This is the beginning of our country's implementation of constitutional government, and it is also the first step for our people to exercise the four powers. As the saying goes, "Be careful in starting things." Whether it is the people who exercise the right to elect, or the people who are running for office, they should be particularly careful. The people should especially cherish their own vote, not only actively participate in voting, but also freely express their own will, not be lured by benefits, and not succumb to threats. Those who are running for office should pay special attention to political morality, learn the ways of democratic countries, and never use illegal means to achieve personal desires. The people's exercise of the four powers is a characteristic of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy, and in the four powers, in terms of the right to elect, we should be particularly careful in exercising the right to elect today. In terms of the promotion of the Principle of Livelihood, our country has been destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, and has long been exhausted. After the victory, there was no opportunity to recuperate, and today it has reached the point where "the people have no means of livelihood." The government should make a decisive decision and resolutely implement new policies, so that the farmers who have been oppressed for a long time and could not get enough to eat and keep warm can breathe a sigh of relief, and then implement the policy of equalizing land ownership, so that they can have their own cultivated land. We believe that if the government is determined to implement the Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of Livelihood, and perseveres with it, then the vast majority of farmers will be given a chance to live and will wholeheartedly support it. Even if the communist bandits want to lure and coerce them, the farmers will inevitably turn away from them. Why would they be deceived and become tools in the end? Therefore, the military action of suppressing the bandits must be combined with new policies aimed at the countryside to alleviate the suffering of the farmers, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Finally, we should know that although China is unfortunately suffering from internal strife, China still occupies a very important position in the international arena, and China really has a bright future that can be viewed with great optimism. Not to mention that the whole country should have this common belief, even friendly countries all hope that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic new China. Strong, unified, and democratic can be said to be the only direction of our country's efforts in the future. Yesterday, we read the editorial of the English-language "The China Daily News", "The Federal Republic of China", which quoted the opinion of a foreigner, talking nonsense about China's political system, and even had the absurd theory of dividing China into two or three countries. We cannot but raise the special vigilance of the people of the country. China must be unified in order to be strong; and only a unified and strong China can contribute to peace in the Far East or peace in the world. Conversely, any plan to divide China, no matter how good the fantasy, will only weaken China's strength and constitute a factor that endangers the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen expressed dissatisfaction with both central centralization and local decentralization, and therefore pioneered the system of balanced power, which is moderate and appropriate, and can be said to be one of the most vehement opponents of the federal system of provinces. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we cannot but take this opportunity to correct these erroneous theories that are not the right medicine for the disease.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Commodity Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanchang, November 11th] Commodity prices in Jiangxi are trending upwards again.

<h3>Shanghai Yarn Merchants Petitioned Ministry of Economy, Agreed to Consider</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association believes that the industry is responsible for regulating the reproduction and rural sideline industries across the country. However, the joint distribution method does not value the industry's position. Therefore, the association publicly recommended Tang Zhiliang and nine others to come to Beijing to petition.

<h3>Some American Merchants Lack Credit; Hong Kong Importers Full of Complaints</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, November 11th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported on the 11th that some Hong Kong and Chinese importers of American goods have recently complained that the goods shipped by American exporters often do not match the conditions and types in the contract. Merchants' grievances are mostly concentrated on the irrevocable letter of credit system, where American merchants can obtain loans from banks before their goods arrive at their destination. By the time the orderers discover that the goods do not match the contract or are of poor quality, it is too late to file a claim. The article also listed the following facts:</p>
<p>Large oranges, ordered from the United States, numbered 280 to 220 per box, but when the goods arrived, there were 330 to 345 small oranges per box, resulting in poor sales and significant losses for importers.</p>
<p>Glassware and transparent combs were ordered, but when the goods arrived, they turned out to be celluloid products.</p>
<p>Well-known brand-name car tires were ordered, but when the goods arrived, they turned out to be inferior tires of unknown brands.</p>
<p>Pigments with a strength of 300% had a strength of only 100% to 150% upon arrival, and the packaging and brand names were different from those ordered.</p>
<p>The article also pointed out that Asian buyers mostly purchase well-known brand-name goods, so importers often suffer losses due to new goods.</p>
<p>Although importers have documents signed by customs officers, most of them do not receive replies when sent to the United States. If the matter is pursued through the US Consulate, it takes too much time.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Awaits Export; Tea Merchants Fund Repair of Roads and Bridges</h3>

<h3>Adjustment of Subsistence Allowances for Provincial and Municipal Air Defense Officers and Soldiers</h3>

<h3>Vandenberg Questions European Aid Plan, Marshall Continues to Explain: More Than $2.6 Billion Needed in Current Fiscal Year, Emphasis on Making Germany Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>(News from this newspaper) New York, 11th Broadcast: Washington News - Under questioning from Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Marshall replied that according to his estimates, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid would be approximately $2,657,000,000 in the fiscal year ending June 30th of next year. This amount would be divided into: emergency aid of $597,000,000 to Austria, France, and Italy, $50,000,000 in transportation costs for U.S. occupied areas, $1,500,000,000 in the first batch of formal aid under the Marshall Plan, and $60,000,000 in the first batch of aid to China.</p>
<p>Under further questioning from Vandenberg, Marshall also stated that aid to Greece and Turkey might need to be increased, but it would not be proposed within the current fiscal year. Marshall strongly stated that the U.S. must make Germany self-sufficient, but only on the condition that it does not restore its war-making capabilities. He strongly denied accusations from other countries that the U.S. was attempting to revive German military strength, calling it a distortion of facts. He said that the purpose of restoring the German economy was, first, to prevent the defeated country from continuing to be a burden on the U.S., and second, to help the economic recovery of all of Europe. Marshall's remarks appeared to be in response to accusations previously made by the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference. Vandenberg then asked whether the four-year European recovery plan initiated by the U.S. would create a barrier between East and West. Marshall replied that the current relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union did not need to be described in detail, but he believed that there was still "hope" for the future, and that this division would not be permanent. Marshall placed particular emphasis on the German problem, believing that European security was truly tied to it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Taft claimed to support "reasonable" European aid, but opposed large expenditures. He frankly stated that when the special session of Congress opens, he will demand that all aspects and results of the Marshall Plan be thoroughly studied and debated. He claimed that the Truman administration, through the International Bank, extracted $4 billion to lend to Britain, secured funding for the Export-Import Bank, and contributed $3 billion to the UNRRA, but most of these funds have been wasted. Taft raised four major objections to the Marshall Plan: It would be extremely dangerous to impose 8 billion in new taxes in the coming year based on the scale of aid self-determined by European aid recipients. Excessive exports will inevitably lead to inflation. Taft criticized the government for wasting money abroad to maintain the U.S.'s high economic level, and warned that such an economy would collapse, citing the Great Depression of 1930 as a warning. Can the Marshall Plan produce the expected results? Taft claimed that the U.S. overemphasized the importance of money; European countries' acceptance or rejection of communism depended on ideals, not U.S. loans. Excessive exports will revive wartime controls. He believes that the restoration of price controls is a great misfortune for the U.S. during peacetime, and the benefits that the Marshall Plan might bring are not enough to offset it.</p>
<h3>Details of Emergency Aid to Europe Bill Submitted to Congress by U.S. Government; No Decision Yet on European Currency Stabilization Fund</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 10th) The State Department submitted a detailed legislative bill for emergency aid to Europe to the Congressional Committee on the 10th. According to the bill, France will receive 110 million in grains, 3 million in dairy products, 20 million in fats and oils, 116 million in American coal, 9 million in German coal, 22 million in petroleum products, 38 million in cotton, and 9 million in fertilizer. Austria will receive 20 million in grain, 13 million in coal, 7 million in seeds and fertilizer, and 2 million in medical supplies. Italy will receive 128 million in grains, 12 million in fats and oils, 5 million in soybeans, 2 million in dairy products, 36 million in American coal, 10 million in German coal, 13 million in petroleum products, 19 million in agricultural supplies, including fertilizer, etc., and 2 million in medical supplies. The U.S. will establish individual agreements with France, Italy, and Austria to ensure that they fully utilize the relief materials for relief and construction purposes, and will require recipient countries to fully publicize the U.S.'s willingness to provide aid. The President has the power to order the cessation of aid to recipient countries that violate these conditions.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 10th) Undersecretary of State Lovett said at a press conference that the State Department has not yet made a decision on the Paris Economic Cooperation Conference's proposal to establish a European currency stabilization fund with 3 billion. Lovett's statement was made after Marshall announced his foreign aid plan to the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses of Congress. Lovett said that Italy's recent urgent needs will be met by transferring funds from the UNRRA relief program to Austria after the end of the UNRRA, which has already been approved.</p>
<h3>Britain Welcomes Douglas's Execution of the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 10th) After the news arrived here from Washington on the 10th that US Ambassador to the UK Douglas might be selected as the executor of the Marshall Plan, the Foreign Office expressed its welcome. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Harriman's report was being carefully studied.</p>
<h3>Opening of Twenty-One Nation European Customs Conference</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Brussels, 10th) The research conference of twenty-one countries discussing the European customs union held its first meeting here on the 10th. The meeting was convened by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. India, Pakistan, South Africa, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also sent observers to attend. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak delivered an opening speech, saying that the establishment of a European economic alliance must be based on the needs of cooperation and sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Rumor that the Soviet Union Has Tested its First Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 11th) A reporter for the Paris Evening News, reporting from Moscow via Prague, claimed that the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb was detonated in a remote area of Siberia on June 15 of this year. Present at the scene were 250 Soviet bomb experts and several government officials. The closest city to the test site was Irkutsk, 50 miles from the southern tip of Lake Baikal and 140 miles from the Outer Mongolian border. The bomb was a small one, weighing only 13 pounds, but it was fully effective, and the effects of the explosion were felt within a radius of 30 kilometers. The reporter also said that he learned from extremely confidential sources that Soviet atomic experts admitted that the Soviet Union was five years behind the United States in the manufacture of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>"[Reuters, London, 11th] People close to the British Foreign Office expressed skepticism about the above rumor, believing that it may be related to Soviet General MacArthur's concern before the Foreign Ministers' Conference and his concerns about US aid to China."</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy Depends on the Situation in China; General MacArthur's Concern and Promises of U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 11th) The United Press learned today that General MacArthur told recent visitors to Japan that Japan's political and economic future is closely related to the outcome of the ideological war in Asia. South Korea has now fallen into the hands of communist forces, and the fate of China has not yet been determined. General MacArthur acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in Asia and expressed that Soviet forces may invade southward, all the way to the coast.</p>
<p>The US Secretary of State's promise of aid to China will undoubtedly gain strong support from foreigners and Japanese in this area. Although Japan is currently the most peaceful country in Asia, it is gradually approaching the forefront of the turmoil in the Far East. General MacArthur and his spokespersons have recently stated that Japan's economic future depends on Asia, especially China, which is Japan's natural market. Japan must obtain sufficient foreign trade to maintain the 15% to 20% of its annual food imports that it needs, and China is the key factor in this. If the Soviet Union can control most of the Asian continent, then its position towards Japan will be equivalent to its position towards Germany in Eastern Europe. Political infiltration can be accelerated along with economic movements, and can be carried out through Japan's highly organized Communist Party spearhead.</p>
<p>Optimism is not Allowed in the Korean Crisis</p>
<p>The situation in South Korea is roughly similar, but Japan is less economically dependent on South Korea. Some diplomats here share General MacArthur's pessimism about Korea, believing that the Soviet organization in North Korea can directly reach the tip of the peninsula after the withdrawal of US troops. However, according to General MacArthur, he is convinced that America's great air force and Pacific bases can crush any attempt to invade Japan and limit Soviet forces to the mainland. General MacArthur declared that the Soviet Union had gained land in the Asian war, while the Western allies had gained the ocean, making the Pacific a military dead zone for the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>India Accepts Junagadh Accession; Pakistan Protests</h3>
<p>"[Reuters, Larel, 10th] Pakistan protested to the Indian government against the Indian military's acceptance of Junagadh State's administration."</p>
<h3>Drafting the German Peace Treaty Committee Issues - The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Fail to Reach Agreement - Today Discussing the Agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) London, November 11th agricultural broadcast: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference held its fourth meeting today. As a result of the debate, no agreement was reached on the issue of member states for the committees drafting the German peace treaty. The Soviet representative insisted that the German peace treaty should be drafted solely by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The United States, on the other hand, advocated that the four powers should include a "suitable number" of other allied countries. The efforts of Britain and France to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union were unsuccessful. Another report states that the four-power deputy foreign ministers debated for two hours today and agreed on one point: they will begin discussing the agenda for the four-power foreign ministers' conference this Wednesday.</p>

<p>Public Utility Rate Hikes Again - Expected to be Implemented in Late November - Automatic Adjustment Method to be Used as Standard - Public Utility Bureau to Meet with Company Representatives Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) According to a responsible person from the Public Utility Bureau, speaking to a reporter yesterday: Adjustment of public utility rates is inevitable this month. Fuel, foreign exchange, and the cost of living index have all risen steadily, with the cost of living index showing the highest percentage increase, making it impossible for various public utility agencies to bear the burden. The four major companies in the city - electricity, telephone, tap water, and gas - formally submitted requests for rate increases at the beginning of this month. After careful review by the Public Utility Bureau, it was determined that they were indeed facing difficulties. If rates were not increased, it would be difficult to maintain operations. If rate increases were allowed, the burden on citizens would increase. Director Zhao has scheduled a meeting with representatives of various public utility companies tomorrow, hoping to reach a compromise on the percentage of increase.</p>
<p>The adjustment of public utility rates this month will use the automatic adjustment method as a standard. This method has been approved by the central government and will be implemented uniformly across the country starting from New Year's Day next year. The full text of this method will arrive in Shanghai within days, and the city's public utility rates can then be adjusted accordingly. It is estimated that the rate increase will occur in late November. According to the Public Utility Bureau, the tap water company has the most urgent need for rate adjustment because water rates were not adjusted in October. As for streetcar and bus fares, it is hoped that they can be maintained at their original prices, with increased ridership serving as a compensatory plan. There will probably be no further increase this month.</p>
<p>(Another report) According to Director Zhao, speaking to a reporter: Since the implementation of electricity conservation measures, citizens have achieved remarkable results in saving electricity. Moreover, the Zhongfang Company has begun generating electricity, approximately 4,500 kilowatts, so temporary power outages for factories and yarn mills have been cancelled, and industrial production is returning to normal.</p>
<p>Fourteenth Resolution of the Economic Inspection Meeting</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Resolution of the Economic Inspection Meeting -益記興 and other Paper Companies are Cleared of Hoarding Suspicion - Paper Factories Ordered to Report Customers Storing Paper</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The fourteenth municipal economic inspection meeting was held yesterday in the municipal government meeting room, presided over by Mayor Wu, with the attendance of more than 20 representatives from relevant agencies. First, the head of the fuel group reported that the coal supply at the Kai mines was abundant, and transportation conditions had improved. A telegram had been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense to request the United Service General Headquarters to dispatch transportation vehicles to transport the coal stored there to Shanghai, so that there would be no shortage of coal in the city.</p>
<p>Next, the heads of the gold and yarn groups and the food group reported on their recent work, which was generally normal. The following matters were then passed:</p>
<p>益記興, 義昌, 元記, 强華 and other paper companies were cleared of suspicion of hoarding and speculation, and the matter should be dismissed and the account books returned.</p>
<p>國華, 大華, 達豐, 唐寅記 and other four paper cutting factories, since they engage in paper cutting, should not store large quantities of paper. They are ordered to report in detail the names, occupations, and addresses of customers storing paper. Those who do not belong to formal bookstores or paper companies storing paper should be prosecuted according to the crime of hoarding.</p>
<p>The paper stored in 大華 paper mill is its own production and should be dismissed from discussion.</p>
<p>Passed the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee's request from the Coal Business Association to amend Article 4 of the Interim Management Regulations for Coal Storage in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The 同康信記 company at 386 Jiangxi Middle Road requested the return of the confiscated telephone, which was resolved: the return is difficult, and it will be temporarily managed.</p>
<p>Passed the rules for handling gold and banknote cases by the Gold and Banknote Group.</p>

<p>Recently, the number of refugees from northern Jiangsu who have fled to Shanghai has been increasing day by day.

In his original letter, he stated that he was awaiting a thorough investigation from his superiors. He also stated that the squadron's horse food was distributed daily according to the current fixed amount and that there were books available for verification. As for the alleged deduction of 1,600 bags of horse feed in July, August, and September, he pointed out that there were a total of 160 horses stationed at the racecourse at that time, and the monthly horse feed was 500 bags. The total for three months was only 1,700 bags. The amount alleged was inaccurate. As for the accusation of "eating empty salaries," all police officers who took leave had original leave vouchers and salary books available for verification, which did not match the facts at all.</p>
<p>In addition, the Luobosen Road Gongda Horse Food Company issued a statement denying that it was selling horse feed to Li.</p>
<p>Pan's Sincere Remarks at the Celebration of the First Industrial Festival - Only by Eliminating the Communists Can the Industrial Future Have Hope</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Yesterday, the industrial sector warmly celebrated the first Industrial Festival. All factories in the city flew flags to celebrate, and all newspapers published special editions. The Shanghai Industrial Association and various industrial trade associations held a celebration ceremony at the New World First Building at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, with the attendance of the heads of various agencies, representatives of various groups, and industrial giants, totaling more than 100 people. Hu Boxiang, Jin Runxiang, Tang Chengzong, Rong Hongyuan, Yu Mingyu, Hong Nianzu, Yan Yaoqiu, Fang Xiaofan, Dong Shuying and other nine people served as the presidium. Jin Runxiang (representing Wu Yun Chu) served as chairman and gave the opening remarks, stating briefly that this was the first Industrial Festival, which was of great significance. Its purpose was to encourage colleagues to work hard to develop the immature industry at any time and to hope that non-industrial people would participate in production. China's industry is now in urgent need of capital, talent, and social guidance. Subsequently, the heads of various agencies, guests, and representatives of the General Federation of Trade Unions gave speeches one after another, and the meal began at 12:30 p.m. and dispersed in high spirits.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan explained in his speech that our country now needs more factories, and small factories should be developed into large factories, so that costs can be reduced and management can be centralized. In this transitional period, we must cultivate China's fragile and meager industry and not engage in power struggles again. He also pointed out two reasons why China's industry currently feels difficult and pessimistic:</p>
<p>The communists are destroying peace, wars are frequent, and production is therefore hindered. We should all realize that if the communists are not eliminated, the industrial future is hopeless.</p>
<p>There is a deep gap between the government and the people, and they do not believe each other. The government should know that "wealth lies with the people," because the sum of the wealth of the people is the country's wealth. If you want to avoid the escape of the people's wealth and capital, you can only do so with openness and transparency. The government does not take from the people outside the law. He also pointed out painfully that China's social organization is not as good as that of foreign countries. With this system lacking organization, it is only engaged in regulation, which is not the right medicine. For example, if the allocation of cotton yarn is uneven, the result will be the opposite. Only the rule of law is the bulwark of China's emerging industry and democratic politics. Finally, he called on the industrial sector to stand up and speak out, saying that only by breaking down the gap between the government and the people and eliminating the communists can the industrial future have hope.</p>
<p>Wang Jiashu, on behalf of Director Wu, delivered a speech, explaining three points:</p>
<p>To cooperate with the government in implementing constitutional government, we must first improve our own organization. It is hoped that the organization of the Shanghai Industrial Association will be completed as soon as possible in accordance with the Industrial Association Law, so as to become a bridge between the government and the people.</p>
<p>The industrial sector should pay special attention to the general election and be able to participate in practical politics.</p>
<p>The psychological gap between labor and capital should be broken down. The capital side should improve the living standards of workers and improve workers' welfare. Workers should be educated and strictly abide by production discipline. He also emphasized that the government is determined and courageous to solve difficulties and enforce discipline, and asked the industrial sector to help the government.</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun requested that labor and capital work together in the same boat, and that the industrial sector should treat workers legally and not exploit them. Working hours should also be regulated. Because the unhealthiness of workers is a loss to the industrial sector, and for the construction of the General Federation of Trade Unions, workers are requested to donate half of today's salary to the General Federation of Trade Unions. In addition, Zhou Lianze (on behalf of Fang Zhi), Zhao Zukang, Zhang Wei, Zhi Huan, and Ouyang Lun spoke one after another. Finally, the celebration unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Auditing Income Tax Extorted 10 Million - Rice Shop Reported by the Guild for Prosecution - Two Auditors Tried Yesterday</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Wang Lianlu and Hu Jinzhang, auditors of the Direct Taxation Bureau, were also tried in the District Court on suspicion of corruption. It turned out that in August of this year, the Direct Taxation Bureau implemented a sampling method for auditing the income tax of profit-making enterprises in 1941. The Yuantai Xing Rice Shop on Nanjing West Road was selected. At 9:00 a.m. on the 19th of the same month, the manager of the shop, Chen Pengfei, sent the account books to the bureau for verification. Wang and Hu were responsible for the inspection, but without careful inspection, they said that there were many errors and that it should be calculated according to last year's turnover, and that 50 million to 70 million yuan should be paid. When asked how to calculate it, Wang said that he would discuss it later. At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, Hu Jinzhang went to the Rongkang Restaurant to wait first, and Wang then went to Yuantai Xing to ask Chen to go to Rongkang for negotiations. After bargaining, Wang and Hu said that if Chen was willing to pay 10 million yuan, the matter could be settled. Chen refused, and Wang and Hu asked Chen to send the general account table of last year to the bureau. The next morning, when Chen sent the account table to the bureau, Hu Jinzhang said again that it did not conform to the format and that he should admit that the account books did not conform and provide written proof, but Chen did not agree. At 9:00 p.m. on the 21st, Wang went to Yuantai Xing again to ask for written proof that the account books were incomplete, but was unsuccessful. They agreed to discuss it again the next morning, and he still asked for 10 million yuan. Chen had no choice but to report it to the Rice Industry Association, which was transferred by the Inspector of the Ministry of Finance to order the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to detain Wang Lianlu and Hu Jinzhang and send them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution on corruption charges. Yesterday afternoon, Wang Jiazhuan, the judge of the 8th Criminal Court of the District Court, tried the case. Wang and Hu denied that they had gone to Yuantai Xing and Rongkang, saying that they had only been to Yuantai Xing last year to check the stamp tax account, so the staff in the shop all knew them. Then Chen Pengfei gave a detailed account of the whole process, and witnesses Wang Guanpei and Yan Liubao proved that Wang had gone to Yuantai Xing twice on August 19th and 21st. After the first visit, he asked Chen Pengfei to go out, and Chen told him before leaving, "I'm going to the Rongkang Restaurant. If anyone comes to find me, you can call me at Rongkang." Finally, after the defendant's lawyer gave a defense, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>Fellow Villagers of Sheng County in Shanghai Feel Unfair for Zhang Chunfan - Xiao Ling's Death Attributed to Leng Shan - Lawsuit Filed for Obstruction of Freedom</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Yue Opera actress Xiao Danggui committed suicide, and Zhang Chunfan, who had lived with her for many years, became the target of public criticism. The District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against Zhang on suspicion of inciting suicide, and Zhang is now in custody. His fellow villagers expressed their indignation, believing that Leng Shan (also known as Jin Zhaoyuan), the actor and director of the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre, one of the main characters in the case, was the fuse that led to Xiao Danggui's suicide. The Sheng County Fellow Villagers Association and the family of the victim specially hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to draft a lawsuit to accuse Leng Shan of "obstructing freedom" in the District Court. There are three points listed as suspected crimes:</p>
<p>The lawsuit is still being polished. After visiting lawyer Mao to inquire about the results, the reporter learned that its main points included:</p>
<p>Leng Shan, as the director and playwright of the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre, was very familiar with Xiao Danggui and Zhang Chunfan. He was well aware of the relationship between Xiao and Zhang. However, Leng Shan admired Xiao Ling's wealth and beauty and wanted to take advantage of her. He devised a play called "Qinhuai Moon," which described a woman being forced by her circumstances and then jumping into the Qinhuai River to commit suicide. Xiao played this role. In the scene where she jumped into the river, in order to make the performance more realistic, he specially ordered Xiao to jump from a high place on the stage to the backstage. Leng Shan waited in the backstage and hugged her when she jumped down. "Qinhuai Moon" was a great success, and it was performed more than a hundred times. Leng and Xiao had intimate actions in each performance, and over time, feelings arose, which caused the feelings between them and Zhang Chunfan to deteriorate day by day. This was the first step in Leng Shan's plan to seduce Xiao Danggui.</p>
<p>After Leng and Xiao fell in love with each other, they immediately communicated secretly in order to connect with each other. From April to June this year, Xiao went on trips at home and abroad and returned late at night, which involved seducing the actor.</p>
<p>Xiao was a woman with a very old-fashioned mindset and was accustomed to playing the leading role in tragedies, which greatly affected her outlook on life. After returning from a night trip with Leng Shan on the evening of October 7, Zhang strictly questioned her. There were many rumors from the outside world, and Xiao, a weak woman, could not bear this blow, so she committed suicide the next day to seek relief. In summary, Leng Shan was guilty of kidnapping Xiao Ling. The lawsuit will be completed today, and after Zhang has reviewed and signed it, it will be delivered to the District Court tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>On the Luang Phibunsongkhram Regime in Siam, the United States and China Hold a Reserved Attitude; Siamese New Cabinet to Hold General Election Within Ninety Days</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 11th dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang stated at today's Political Affairs Conference that our government is adopting a cautious attitude regarding the new regime in Siam. Around 5 PM, Foreign Minister Wang met with the Siamese Ambassador to China, Dullah Saekuraan, and it is heard that they discussed matters concerning the safety of our overseas Chinese in Siam, the existing rice supply, and the general election for merchants and civilians. The ambassador viewed the coup in his country as a revolutionary act and remained calm.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th dispatch] The State Department announced today that further and more detailed reports are needed regarding the overthrow of the Siamese government before a decision can be made on whether to recognize the new government. This is because Luang Phibunsongkhram is accused of collaborating with Japan during the war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 11th dispatch] Twenty-four hours after seizing power, Marshal Phibunsongkhram announced on the night of the 10th that Siam would revise all its obligations to foreign countries. At the same time, he appointed a 28-member military committee, with himself as the chairman, and also appointed a 20-member cabinet, with Aphaiwong as Prime Minister, who had previously served as Prime Minister when the Japanese occupied the country in 1944. Former Prime Minister Luang Thamrong and anti-Japanese leader Pridi Banomyong disappeared after the incident, presumably hiding in Bangkok. Meanwhile, the existing Regency Council has been dissolved and replaced by a Supreme State Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 11th dispatch] The new cabinet took over administration today. Aphaiwong has assumed the post of Prime Minister for the third time in three years, with Luang Phibunsongkhram voluntarily manipulating everything from behind the scenes. The military government has decided to dissolve the parliament, draft a new constitution, and stipulate that a general election be held within ninety days.

<p>(United Press, Lake Success, 10th Dispatch) Regarding the Soviet proposal on the partition of Palestine, representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union have today agreed on a compromise plan, which will be submitted to the UN General Assembly's Palestine Partition Subcommittee for review.

A committee of three or five members should be established, with members composed of representatives of small countries elected by the UN General Assembly. This committee will be responsible for administering Palestinian affairs in the transitional period between the end of the mandate and the realization of independence. This group should exercise its powers under the guidance of the Security Council and submit a report once a month. During the transitional period between the approval of the partition by the UN General Assembly and the end of the mandate, Britain should continue to be responsible for law and order and public utilities in Palestine.</p>
<p>(United Press, Lake Success, 10th Dispatch) After condemning the Soviet Union's use of the veto power to prevent the admission of several applicant countries, the UN Political Committee, by an overwhelming vote, requested the Security Council to re-examine the applications of Italy, Austria, Finland, Portugal, Ireland, and Transjordan before the end of this session of the General Assembly.</p>
