<h3>少數黨參加大選　週內再舉行談判</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕國民黨中央黨部某氏，對往訪記者稱「民社黨與國民黨關於參加大選之商談，所以未能達到協議之　結，在於如何使能達到少數黨有相當人數當選之技術問題，蓋各地選民有投票之自由，即國民黨提名之候選人，亦難担保其必能當選，國民黨人深望能與少數黨在大選中密切合作，而在技術上如何能達到各黨派均有相當人數當選，則略感困難，故尙待繼續研究。至於少數黨推舉黨員參加民選之地方民意機構問題之如何解決，亦須待續作商討，但參加各地臨時參議會一節，則並無困難之可言」。</p>

<p>對於商業登記法草案，本報業於本月一日著論，粗陳意見，而意有未盡，茲再申論如次：</p>
<p>省去重複手續。　辦過公司登記的，照例不必再辦商業登記；爲的是公司名稱已於登記時一併確定了，其商號權已不發生問題，自可毋　再求保護。照此推論，則凡依照其他洗令，其商號權已得所保陣時，如果再辦商業登記，在手續上即是多餘。所以糧商行號及典當等，凡已照章領得部照的，立法上似可許其除外，這在商人方面，固可以省去一道重複的手續，而於政府的管理方面，却也並無何等欠缺。</p>
<p>多設登記機構。　現行法規定，商業登記之主管署，在縣為縣政府，在院轄市為社會局。這在市的方面尙無大妨礙，因爲商號比較集中，而且距離有限，交通工具較多，即使爲手續關係，往返奔走數次，勉强還受得了。至於縣的情形，可就大不同了。除掉城廂以外，其四鄉市集，近者數十里，遠或至數百里，如果照現行辦法，必須一律逕向縣府申請，則其食宿舟車等川旅費用，勢必數倍於登記費用，那就未免太病商了。爲解隊這項困難起見，似可規定，准由縣府委托各地區公所代辦或承接，以卹商艱。</p>
<p>代辦登記手續。一切登記手續，包括證件和費用等等，看起來，似乎並不十分困難。但在一般商民，疏於法令，闇於表格，往往望洋興嘆，弄得手足無措。即如上海一埠，號稱風氣早開，商人水準較高，但有許多商家，還不得不另化一筆費用，請求專家來代辦，何况內地城市？上海市社會局深知這種情形，曾經頒行了一種公會代辦的規則，這也無非爲解除商民的困難起見。內地專家旣少，隔閡更多，也可明定辦法，酌取費用，凡是不會塡表申請的，准由主管機關指定人員，一一指導，代爲塡寫，以免東碰西撞，使商人感受到精神與物質上無窮的損失。</p>
<p>仍許自由登記以上各項，均係爲便利商民起見。但如照草案所訂，商業登記改爲强迫登記，一切勒限飭辦，違即罰辦，則保商政策（保護商號權）仍不免踰淮爲枳，變面爲厲民的　政。所謂强迫登記，無補於政府的管理，其理由已見前文。顧有人以爲不辦強迫登記，在政府便不能窺見商業的全貌，從而無以定補偏救敝的適當方針；換句話說，凡主張強迫登記的，其目的乃在於獲得關於商業的調査統計，以爲施政之參考，這原也無可厚非。但須知行政上的調査統計，應由政府自行舉辦，不應勞民傷財，責令全體商民，在商業登記的名義，勞費，與罰則之下，滿足其副作用的欲望。例如去年本市，曾有某某等機關團體，辦過一次勞工狀况關査，即是自發表格，自行收集，自派人員指導，在各工廠，不過依據事實，各　所知，擴說結果很爲圓滿。我們認爲，這種良好的慣例，凡是要辦商業調查的，正不妨　效一下。</p>
<p>而且商人貪圖簡便，其偷惰的心理相當濃厚，縱使雷厲行，一律强制登記，其結果也未必十分圓滿。何以見得？現在同業公會的必須參加，在法律上是强制的，而且還訂有罰則，但沒有入會的，依舊很多。工人，必須加入工會，在法律上，也是硬性規定的，但沒有入會的，工人也同樣很多。又如現在的商業登記，根據部令，也朱嘗不是强制的，上海創辦之初，並且還劃定區域，限期竣事，常時本市的單行法，實比草案還要嚴峻得多，但是時將兩年，多方督促，屢次展期，到如今，已辦登記的，聽說還不過六萬家左右。至於內地各縣，非但商人毫不關心，即主管其事的縣府，多半也　無暇及此。照此推論，要　商業登記來獲得一種全　的商業調査統計，恐不免近於理想。</p>
<p>五，增加限制條款。　彼據　　，可以推動登記的，倒不在法的强制，而在利的引誘。拿上海來說，凡是蹂躪登記，登記竣事，而且登記得太多的，只有有貨可配的各行業。據說：本市的糧食行號，其總數在四千家以上。某有關方面　嫌其多，很想加以限制；但是條件其備，憑甚麽條文來拒絕其登記？還有幾個公會配貨之故，新會員突然暴增，非但粥少僧多，削弱了他們固有的利益，抑且喧賓奪主，搖動了他們原來的地位，曾經動公事，請官　設法限制，但是在現行法下，又有何法可予以限制？</p>
<p>大家知道：上海地方，還有一類形同虛設的滑頭字號，專以投機詐欺爲業；但他們只須備具條件，請求登記，却也無法加以拒絕。又依照非常時期農礦工商管理條例第二十條，對於製造奢侈品，或其他非必要之企業，原可加以限制，但在商業登記法中並無芷條。最可異的是，賭博明明違禁，而賭具的製造售賣，登記法中亦並無可以禁止的明文。諸如此類，其例甚多。我們認爲施行細則第六條所定限制登記的條件，即「不背於公共秩序」，及「善良風俗」這爾句，實在不够，有予以補充的必要。</p>
<p>草案第七章規定：「本法施行前尙未登記之商業，應於本法施行後一年內，依照本法規定，聲請設立登記。」這個限期，亦嫌太促。但着上海辦理兩年，據從寬估計，已登記的，還不過三分之二，則在其他尙未推動，或轄境遼關的各縣市，其需要更多的時問，自可想見。須知道項限期，若經訂入條文，便是硬性規定。設使期滿尙未辦竣，非但未登記的商號，將一槪陷於非法，便是各市縣的主管機關，也少不得負有奉行不力之咎。所以登記期限，最好不必列入條文，可讓各地行政機關自行酌量伸縮。</p>

<h3>宋子文發表談話</h3>
<p>（上接一版）宋氏稱：「關於管理外匯及進出口貿易各項暫行辦法，均係經國防最高委會核准施行，本人任行政院長，負依法執行之責，凡任內所結匯之各項外匯，經本人核准者，均係依照規定，經審査合於管理辦法，准許結匯，絕對無絲毫不合規定之處。自卅五年二月政府召開政治協商會議後，一般人民皆以爲國家從此可以安定，故政府傾全力於機定物價，安定金融，俾久經戰禍之人民可稍蘇息，不料共產黨　背協定，復起戰事，交通工　多被破壞，生產能力减低，同時，軍費加多，發行劇增，此稱演變情形，自不能由本人一身負其責任，社會自有公論，無待　言。至孚中。揚子及建設銀公司所結外匯之事，迭經財政部詳細調查，並已公布數額，計祇合外　總數百分之點五，即爲千分之，前次美國聯合社發表消息，以爲此三公司　　外匯，　佔進　貿易，自經財政部調表公有情　，即可　示聯合社之消息絕無根據，亦決　獨佔進出；貿易之可能，本人對孚中。揚子兩公司素未聞問。至對中國建設銀公司、本人於就行政院長時，即已辭去理事名義，各公司即使或有不合規定之經營，亦應山各該公司負責人負責，與本人決不相干，監察院所公布全文，今日尙未全部見及，茲就報上所戰，摘要略　意見。」</p>

<h3>監院報告書全文</h3>
<p>（續昨）　自三十五年十一月十七日政府頌布修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，並成立臨時輸入管理委會調整外匯率爲三·三五〇後，除個人及其他非進口所需外匯仍由指定銀行繼續核准結　外，關於進口貨需要外匯之申請，在十一月十七日以前　並經指定銀行開立信用狀式、在十一月廿四日以前（香港以十一月廿日爲限）起運來華者，除附表物品應向輸入臨時管理委會秘書處申請外，其餘一切進口物品，均向央行外匯審核處申請輸入許可證，其定貨日期在中一月十七日以後者，則依貨物類別分送　　　時管委會各處辦理審核事宜，即修正進出口貿易暫行辦法附表一之貨品，應向該會秘書處申請，附表二之貨品，應向限額分配處或輪入品管理處申請，附表三甲之貨品，應向央行外匯審核處申請，指定銀行對於進口商申請之外匯，非經各該主管機關事先審核許可者，不得自由結售（但附表一及附表三甲所列之貨品，其價値在美金二千兀以內者，指定銀行仍得核結外匯）。至於個人及其他非進口（如出口保險費運費等）之結售，央行於卅五年十二月十六日，以第六十九號通兩，規定自即日起，須由央行核准後方可向指定銀行結售。經此管制，進口數量乃逐漸减少，而外匯之浪費情事亦少發現</p>
<p>本年二月　，黃金風潮發生，物價飛漲外匯之黑市，二月一日爲七六〇〇元，二月五日升至九〇〇〇元，十日升至一三五〇〇元，二月十四日升至一四〇〇〇元，於是政府乃不得不頒　緊急經濟措據方案，禁止黃金及美鈔自由買賣及使用，同時調整匯率爲一二〇〇〇元，當時出口於短期內頗呈活躍，進口則愈感困難　近月以來，黑市死灰復燃，復　官價脫節，出口商亦覺束手，僑匪進口均逃避於香港一帶，各指定銀行外匯業務日形鋭减，於是政府乃更有八月十七日將外匯牌價除固定官價外，同時採用視市價情形隨時變更之辦法，對於進口物品，自八月十八日起，更明令一切自備外匯者亦暫行停止進口，以求外匯之使用作更進一步之緊縮。</p>
<p>（丙）外匯使用數字之分析</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利以後，外匯管理機構及使用政策屢有變更，已如上述，在各期中之外匯使用，經査下列各項數字：</p>
<p>中央銀行及各指定銀行共售給一般工商業及私人合法所需外匯數量，除自三十四年八月十九日至三十五年三月三日，共計出售美金六四，二〇〇，八四五，九五元，已如前述外，計自三十五年三月四日起至同年十一月十七日止，八個半月中，依照進出口貿易暫行辦法之規定，除附表乙所列各項貨物應予禁止進口，附表甲所列各項須經向海關申請許可後方准進口外，其未經列入兩附表之各種貨物，均可自由進口，僅須向海關依照規定稅則申請納稅，並無一定數量之限制，其所需　付價款之外匯，亦應依照申請數類　量供給。在此一時期內，中央銀行及各指定銀行共售出外匯計美金三八一，五二二，四六一，一三元，英金一六，七六一，六六〇鎊，港幣二四，三二五，五八九，八八元。至三十五年十一月十七日，政府修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，自同月十八日起，至三十六年二月十五日，按照修正辦法附表一，售出美金二，三四〇，三三三，二〇元，英金七七，一七七鎊，港幣八一，七二〇，八三元，按照附表二，售出美金一〇，五五九，四六〇，八〇元，英金三四九，六九八鎊，港幣二五五，三七五，〇〇元，按照附表三甲，售出美金七，二一二，二四六，八〇元，英金四四七，〇二九鎊，港幣三，二一二，〇八三，四二元。總計自三十五年三月四日至三十六年二月十五日止，共售出美金四〇一，六六三，五〇一，九三元，英金一七，六三五，五六四鎊，港幣二七，八七四，七六九，一三元。其中自三十五年十一月十八日至卅六年二月十五日所售者，計美金二〇，一一一，〇四〇，八〇元，英金八七三，九〇四鎊，港幣三，五四九，一七九，二五元，僅相當於總額百分之五。在此兩期中，以其總數論，自三十五年十一月十八日至卅六年二月十五日，因修正進出口貿易暫行辦法之公布，外匯使用數量已大見　　。以其使用者之對象論，行政院核准結售與政府機關者，共合美金二〇，四三四，〇八五，六六元，核准進口之貨品約合美金四億八千餘萬元，核准個人及工商業之申請約合美金二千三百餘萬元。自本年二月十六日起，至八月卅日止，各指定銀行共計售出外匯，計按照附表一者，售出美金四，九八一，八七八，五二元，英金六三五，九六五鎊，港幣一五五，九九八，〇〇元。按照附表二售出者，計美金一〇〇，六五五，六八八，〇〇元，英金四，〇一八，七九八鎊，港幣四，二九三，七一八，〇〇元。依照附表田會出者，計美金七，四九五，八九二，〇〇元，英金九四五，五八二鎊，港幣二，〇九九，六三三，〇〇元。共約合美金一億五千萬元，（詳附件五，六）</p>
<p>以進口物品內容言，最大數量爲棉花，計自去年三月四日至本年八月三十日，其進口總値爲美金一二〇，七九四，一七八，〇〇元，英金一，八九四，八二〇鎊，港幣一七六，七三七，〇〇元，印幣六五，〇五六，〇五六盧比，約合美金一億八千萬元。其次爲液體燃料，約合美金一億二千五百萬元，烟葉與香烟約合美金四千五百萬雹，化學藥品約合美金七千八百五十萬元，　類食品約合美金二千七百五十萬元以上，五金機器約合美金八千萬兀，交通器材（包括汽車）約合美金二千六百萬元，（詳附件五）。由此可知一年餘以來之鉅額外匯，用之於消發方面者較多，而用之　設方面者實少。</p>
<p>（丁）中央信托局物資供應局及世界司使用外匯訂購物資之情形</p>
<p>中央信託局　査該局經辦向國外訂購物資，係由購料處統籌負責，其經辦物資約可分為三類，第一類為代政府處理國外進口物炎，計自三十四年至本年八月底止，計有洋米，麵粉，活動房屋，白報紙，紙漿，煤炭，棉花及汽車等項，（詳附件七）。其中汽車一項，係奉行政院令訂購者（詳下節）。第二類爲代各機關向國外訂購之物資計自卅四年九月份起，至木年八月底止，共計一百七十九起，有六十二起爲代液體燃料管理委員會，航空委員會，軍政部，聯動總部，空軍總司令部機關所訂購之汽油·機油，飛機用油，卅二起爲各機關購買汽車及車胎等項，大都經行政院或財政部核准結匯者。此外各起爲　張，機器，藥品，化學用品，圖書議器，蔴袋等，尙無若何　侈性質之物品（詳附件八）。第三類爲中信局向國外自購物資，計自卅四年九月至本年入月底止，共計十四起，其中除報紙，蔴袋，馬口鐵，燕麥，黃凡士林等項，或以自用，或以配售爲必需用品外，其中遵林紙二一三噸計美金九一，九五〇，〇〇元，美國洋松五，二一〇，四〇三板呎，計美金五一五，四四一，四二元，雪佛蘭汽車七輛，計美金一七，〇〇〇，〇〇元，以該局擁有外匯之便不免有用非急要之處（詳附件九）。</p>
<p>物資供應局　物資供應局設立之主要目的，一以補助政府平衡預算收支，利用物資，吸收法幣換取外匯，同時對於抗戰後各方剩餘物資，集中保管，適當分配，以免浪費。據該局報吿，自成立迄本年八月底止，經辦各案，計有租借接購物資，世界貿易公司物資，加拿大貸款物資，出口銀行物資，租借剩餘物資，美國剩餘物資，英信貸款物資，接收經濟部重慶器材總庫物資，世界貿易公司存印物資，英信貸款存印物資，其他存印物資等案，共計收入美金一七四，八〇一，一一六，三二元，英金三四五，〇七五鎊，國幣五，八六〇，八四六，八六三，〇〇元（詳附件十）。此項物資之內容，均爲軍需品，鐵路器，材，機器配件，兵工器材，紡織品及其設備，航空器材，化學工程，藥品儀器等。惟美軍剩餘物資內有車輛一項，共値美金七，七九四，三五二，一五元，其車輛均原爲美軍使用之吉普車卡車等。又世界貿易公司物資內，有汽車零件，共値美金一八五，九二七，二六元。此外査悉該局先後購進小汽車十輛，計卅五年九月六日進口澳斯丁牌汽車五輛，廠慣尙不超出規定限額，但未經報由海關査驗，即行提出價賣，卅六年二月廿八進口小汽車五輛，內福特牌車四輛，卡特拉克牌車一輛，據稱係奉行政院秘書處從伍字第一一二二六日號函核准，亦未報經海關査驗。又卅五年九月九，卅六年四月十七日，先後進口碧克牌車三輛，均領有許可證，報經海關驗訖。此外該局於卅五年十二月二十二日購進冰箱三隻，査該局之任務，原爲根據法案，代孜府購運戰後剩餘物資，此類汽車冰箱之購運，實已　越該局業務範圍，且該局藉交通運輸工具之便利，及平日運進物資不必按一般進口手續報關査驗，此項汽車　行進口，在手續上實有不合之處。</p>
<p>世界貿易公司（UnlversalTrading　Corporation）査世界貿易公司之組織（按即合衆社所指之一統公司），係民國二十七年十月經貿易委員會核准，於紐約註册成立，當時該公司所負任務，爲代政府以本國出口桐油及其他生產在美銷售，償　美國借款，貿易委員會在國內組織復興公司及富華公司，主持辦理，各公司資金，均由財政部撥充，嗣借款雖經償淸，惟戰時各方需要物資　多，委託該公司在美購買。査該公司設於紐約，以陳光甫為董事長，總經理爲洛海（Lechhead），副總經理任嗣達，夏鵬，其業務除代行貿易委員會之原有委託工作外，本年七月行政院復訓令接　華盛頓物資供應委員會工作，所有對外訂購及催運物資等工作，均由該公司負責辦理。惟該公司自成立迄今，雖在其性質上爲財政部機構之一部分，而在國內迄無正式辦事機構，故外間多不明眞相，中外報章甚至誤爲「豪門資本」之組織，且該公司旣爲財政部之附屬機構，而其歷年營業決算，均未編報（見財政部財庫陸寅宥電），本年三月經催，始呈送去年決算表，其中總務管理及間接費用，（General　adminstiueand　ceuerhead　for　expenses）達美金三六一，二九〇，〇六元，意外準備金（Reserueler　contingencies）美金一，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇元。又外匯審核委員會曾向行政院建議、資源委員會駐美代表辦事處，駐美中國物資委員會，交通部駐美辦　處，術生部駐美辦事處等，應合併統一機構，以節省經費，除駐美中國物資委員會已撤銷外，其他機構均繼續存在，似此不惟政府向外採購物資有紛歧之象，且浪費外匯，　有早日統一合併之必要。即世界貿易公司本身採購物資內容，以其在美辦公，無從審核，今後似亦宜有嚴密之審核監督辦法，以免有浪費之處。且物資供應局及中央信託局購料處之業務，亦復與該公司不免雷同，（査中信局各機關託購物資及物資供應局購運物資，均有該公司委託項目），亦有儘速統一之必要。（關於世界貿易公司有關文卷存財政部）。（下接第五版）</p>

<h3>東西集團形成對峙局面　美蘇妥協希望渺茫　聯大進入第四週毫無成就</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖六日電〕蘇聯之新國際共產組織，六日使聯合國大會陷於混亂之中，同時將東西集團可能在本屆大會及不久舉行之其他會議中重歸於好之希望，片片碎作蝴蝶舞，在此驚人消息宣佈之同時，聯合國各國代表益感美國原定爭取領導權之諾言釆能兌現，國務卿馬歇爾並未順從衆望負起領導，而至今採取超然熊度。若干聯大代表解釋蘇聯之行動，爲數月來與西方國家進行多時之「外交戰」之正式宣佈。歐洲九國之共黨集體組織事實上之新共產國際一舉料不久將在大會各委會中表現，蘇聯及其衛星國家之代表先是已在委會中大事攻訐美國之「販　戰爭」「帝國主義」及「統治世界」。各小國現下預測在今後數月中，大規模政治戰即將發</p>
<p>美國在聯合國之計劃，已產生下列可疑之進步：　美國方面聯大主席候選人澳外長伊伐特竟吿失敗。　美國雖居少歡，强硬拒絕由烏克蘭代波關爲安理會理事，刻正爲印度請命。　美國原曾嚴詞譴　南·保·阿三國爲侵略，而今如三國同意接受聯合國新使節團，且與之合作，美國準備護步。　美國將韓國問題提交聯大，蘇聯之反響則爲建議美蘇兩軍在今年底前自瑚　撤退，美國尙不能協議得一詳盡之反建機。　美代表團仍大驚小怪，研究對付維辛斯基「販賣戰爭」指斥之對策。　馬歇爾仍拒絕發表美國對巴勒斯坦之地位。　馬歇爾「小型大會」之計劃，反響不熱烈，美國至友如英國亦不感興趣。過去三週中之僵局及宣傳性演說，令人懷疑五十七國之大會委員會是否能解決安理會之麻痺。</p>
<h3>美國秉不屈不撓精神　世界自由繁榮　奧斯汀駁覆共產黨宣傳</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約五日電〕美駐聯合國首席代表奧斯汀，五日向全國廣播，各方成認係答覆歐洲共黨攻擊美國資本主義體制之一項公報者。</p>
<p>奧氏雖未提及共黨之名，亦未直接提及蘇聯，然渠明白　明：美國並不受任何宣傳運動之恐嚇，同時，渠駁斥共黨之攻擊，類美國在經濟上，思想上皆未以馬歇爾計劃，杜魯門主義，或其他方法，力圖操縱其他國家。吾人正努力完成任何國家不能支配其他國家之局勢。吾人寗願爲世界復興，爲世界難設，以及爲世界安定及自由繁榮而堅決奪鬥。予相信在聯合國大會中現正熱烈進行之建設性力量，以及最近十六國所草成之復興計劃，最後必能獲得成功。</p>
<h3>伊頓率直批評　蘇聯威嚇運動</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕衆院外委會主席伊頓，昨日批許最近蘇聯指責美國爲「戰爭販子」一事，爲成嚇運動之一部份。渠指出：「吾人早已應該由另一獨裁者（此獨裁者現已不再與吾人在一起）之處學得敎訓，即最大聲與最激烈之　　，乃一種心理攻勢，有時用以　言敗績，有時爲轉移國人之注意力，以掩蔽其獨裁者對國人所加之死傷。」</p>
<h3>聯大特委會辯論　巴勒斯坦問題　各方正靜待美宣示態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約六日廣播：成功湖訊：今日上午十一時四十分，聯大特別委員會將恢復辯論巴勒斯坦問題，首光發言者爲巴拿馬代表雷葉斯。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖五日電〕聯合國關於巴勒斯坦爭端，聞已接近重要發展階段？在六日至九日間，美國關於巴勒斯坦之將來，必將表明其能度，究採取何種途徑加以解決，關於爲歇爾對此一問題之立塲，雖外界謠傳紛紜，然其能度究屬如何，當不得而知。猶太復國派官員相信，除非美國對成立猶太國採取友好之堅決立塲，猶太復國派很少有機會實現渠等之希望。渠等深懼美國能度曖昧，足使阿拉伯人獲得實際勝利及貫澈巴勒斯坦阿拉伯國家獨立要求。</p>
<h3>美援歐計劃　實現希望轉濃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約六日廣播：莫斯科宣佈共產國際之復活，可使美國國會中支持社魯門總統援歐計劃之力量增强。政府方面希望能在十二月一日前召開國會特別會議，刻正等特國會方面人士作最後之決定。研究援歐計劃之專家認爲美國政府能設法撥出二億元，以應本年底前歐洲方面之各種急需。國會如不召開特會，則在明年一月間復會時，可能核准六億至八億元，以待實施馬　爾計劃時再作統盤籌戲。又訊，杜魯門刻正物色有能力之民政人負規劃援獻計劃事宜，先前起草原子能國際管制之巴　　氏，呼聲甚高。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕參院撥款委會主席勃列傑斯召集該委會於十一月十八日開會，審查杜魯門總統對歐五億入千萬元之臨時緊急援助計劃。此乃該一計劃實行前，必須得其批准之國會四機構之一。參院外委會則定十一月十日開會。</p>

<h3>杜魯門馬卿向國人廣播　呼籲節食援西歐　俾對世界和平有所貢獻</h3>
<p>〔聯合華盛頓六日電〕杜魯門總統今日發動對西歐　荒作空前之「克己」攻勢，主張議性口腹，爲美國對和平之　獻。總統請全國人民於星期二不吃肉類，星期四不吃蛋及家禽，並每日節省麵包一片。</p>
<p>此外又要求雜糧交易所將買方應付現金提高至百分之卅三又三分之一，以防止投機。白宮另一要求爲釀酒業應在最早期內停工六十日，釀酒商稱爲晴天霹　。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾廣播稱，食糧爲美外交政策之最切要因素，美人民對食糧之態度，能促成或破壞舉世之和平與安全。「自今日起，至多到冬季終了爲止，美國男女老幼均將對國際事務發揮個人之力量。美國個人及世事間之關係已昭然若揭。我國之外交政策已進入美國人之家庭，且已與美人同桌而食，如今冬發生　　嚴寒及匱乏，歐洲經濟可能立即崩潰，吾人亦將受嚴重影響。」</p>

<h3>坂垣征四郎受審　竟謂我軍引起東北事變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕東京戰犯法庭六日關始審詢主要戰犯之一關東軍副參謀長板垣征四郞。渠堅稱：一九三一年九一八東北事件，僅爲偶然之遭遇，並非有計劃之侵略，且實由中國軍隊不時之破壞行動所引起者。辯護律師又稱板垣之入近衛內閣任陸相，目的在協助近衛，商議撤退日軍以求中日事件之和平解決。</p>

<h3>共產國際宣告復活　展開全面反美運動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕此間政界人士認歐洲九國共黨之在具爾格勒特設立聯合局，意在團結共黨力量以反抗馬歇爾援歐計劃及美國一般政策．義法兩國在此一新共產國際中之地位，乃在針對美國對於兩國發展之重視。猶憶馬歇爾援助建議初次提出之時，義共黨初贊成義國之參加，捷克及波蘭之共黨亦未反對。</p>
<p>歐洲共產黨人最近活動情形</p>
<p>自二月間許多國這共產黨在倫敦參加英國共產黨之大會後，西歐共黨之企國採取獨立行動，已益趨明顯。其後法國，比利時，及義大利之共產黨，即相率退出聯合內閣，而最近英國之共產黨，亦自有條件的支持工黨政府一變而爲無條件的　　工黨政府；而法國共黨復宣布將對黨員施行信任史達林主義之敎育。在東歐方面，共產黨與他黨之聯繫亦吿脫離。波蘭，匈牙利，捷克之企圖成立社會黨協定，以合倂政黨，已吿失敗。匈牙利捷克之最近社會黨執委會會議，匪特拒絕與共黨合併，且拒絕於今後發表任何共同宣言。羅馬尼亞及保加利亞之社會黨，對於與共產黨之關係尙在待決之中，預料在東歐國家內，抨擊社會黨內反對與共黨合併者么攻勢，必將加緊。自對前敵國之新約生效後，盟國與前敵國政黨組繼聯合機構之技術上的障礙，已吿廢除。在歐洲國家中，尙有米參加此一新共產國際之共產黨，即斯坎的那維並該國，芬關，荷蘭，比利時，德，奧，瑞士，希臘，及英國之共產黨。大致而論，此等國家之共產黨，均難望有合理的機會，以獲得政權。</p>
<p>莫斯科觀察家認為意義重大</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科五日電〕此間觀察家咸認九國共黨委員會之在貝爾格勒之成立，爲一九四三年共產國際解散以來共產政治最重要之發展。蘇聯共產黨之會同國外共產黨，公然宣佈世界業已裂成兩大陣綫，尙屬第一次，實爲動員共產勢力以抗帝國主義第一步公開具體行動，其意義之重大，因法義兩國共黨勢力雄厚而益增。其用意在對以美國爲中心之帝國主義，公然宣戰，亦在向全世界各處擴張共黨實力，同時亦爲共同擬具反抗金元帝國主義計劃之前奏。</p>
<p>共黨全面反美華府密切注視</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕莫斯科宣布之歐洲九國共產黨會議及其對美政治宣言，美國官方今日認爲戰前蘇聯操縱之國際共產運動現已復活。莫斯科宣布此事，證明其決心展開全面運動，反對美國及其外交政策與領袖人物，以爭取西歐乃至世界其他軍略地點之控制。此種行動與蘇聯現在聯合國大會中進行者如出一轍，直至最近爲止，蘇方曾公開否認共產主義爲一有組織之國際運動。史達林在戰時宣布解散共產國際以增强對英美之關係，尤其是對美關係，以取得租借法下之軍備，從事對德戰爭；惟今昔異時，第三國際似可再被利用矣。</p>
<p>英國共黨表示完全出於意外</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕英國共黨某員稱，設立共產國際機構之消息，完全出於英共黨意料之外　左翼工黨議員「叛黨」領袖克洛茲曼稱，余認莫斯科給予各國共黨之獨立性，似欠滿意，故有予以糾正之必要。但就西歐之社會黨言，正可以此爲警惕，速即組織西歐社會黨共同機稱，以實行共同政策。</p>
<p>法國政界觀察蘇將採新政策</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六日電〕法政界人士認新共產國際之成立，爲蘇聯對西方國家，尤其是法義兩國，採取新政策之先聲。若干觀察家認此舉係表示克里姆林之恐懼於十一月之四强外長會後，蘇聯將更陷於孤立。九國共黨領袖之宣言，意在使法共義共完全投入蘇聯懷抱。法共秘書長陶萊士今日在法國南部貝比農向一萬民衆致辭，譴責美國銀行家之壓迫法政府，不使共黨參加內閣。</p>
<p>戴高樂奧外長猛烈抨擊蘇聯</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎六日電〕戴高樂五日在此間政治集會發表演說稱：美國之堅決反蘇，對法安全，極屬重要。戴氏稱：美國保存其實力未動，以對抗蘇聯在世界之野心，吾國人民尤其了解此種保障，雖屬間接，然頗重耍。</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納五日電〕奧人民黨黨員五萬人今日在此召開大會，奧外長葛魯勃蒞會致辭，評述共黨組國際機構之事，謂共產黨業已出動，將利用奧國人民之　要以奪取政權。葛氏繼猛烈抨擊共黨之宣傳，並曰，奧國之基本利益，在希望鄰邦，尤其是蘇聯，勿支持共產黨發動之內部傻略。奧內政部次長格拉夫痛　共黨籌備整套陰謀，並聲言奧國決不屆服於其威脅之下。</p>

<h3>同學母子情侶　關係三重奏　曲折姻緣家庭奇變　自由戀愛罔顧倫常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院昨接受一光怪陸離，跡近亂倫之案件，情節曲折，極富戲劇意味。男女主角六年前爲同學，三年前爲母子，目前則爲「夫婦」。緣有李成三者，係廣東人經商爲業。有女名佩華，現年廿五，係中韓混血兒。绮年玉貌，風姿綽約。太平洋戰事爆發後，成三堆存香島之貨物被搶一空，損失極大。成三欲　補　損，向其稔友解敬商借現款。解慨然允諾，惟以髮妻於戰時被炸身死，欲娶李佩華續絃，以爲借款條件。李成三滿口答應。不意李佩舉與解子之雄係中學時代同學，平素情投意洽，交往頗密，若嫁解敬齋，將來處境勢將大窘，且敬　年過半百，紅顏白髮，實不相配，因此佩華堅拒不從。嗣李成三以自殺爲要挾，强令佩華農解敬　結　，佩華無法，允之，並電吿時在柏林求學之解之雄，促其歸來，及之雄返國，則佩華已　解敬齋，昔日密友，已變繼母。解敬齋為顧全家庭起見，命之雄與一女子名蘇逸雲者訂婚。至本年婚期前夕，解之雄突偕繼母李佩華雙雙由穗逃走，各留一函致解敬　，略謂現代婚姻應兩相情願，自由戀愛，豈能仍效封建社會之買賣式强迫施行，今我等遠離汝之罪惡家庭，汝雖欲千里訪尋，亦屬徒勞云云。解敬　未予根究，但蘇逸雲擬另嫁他人，因曾與解之雄訂有婚約，擬請解除，關解之雄與李佩華在滬，特具狀陳明上述經過，向本市地院聲請准于解除婚約。</p>
<h3>借名敲詐慰勞金·　·民政局派人澈查</h3>

<h3>南京路上薄暮火警　華聯同樂會焚燬　鄰居多家遭殃及</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京路一九四號華聯同樂會，昨晚六時因二樓廚房間不愼起火，致延及店面房屋　豐烟號，文　文具公司及上海市興業信託社。其樓上部份俱遭焚毀，損失頗鉅。同時二〇八弄中之一·二·三號亦被燒毀。西鄰大公報營業處，幸救火車於六時半陸續趕到，未被殃及，僅二樓略受水漬及飽受山塲虛　而已。當火起一刻鐘後，因有風勢之助，瞬即穿穿屋頂，是時正當南京路華燈初上，行人熙攘之際，故一時情形極爲混亂。少頃警員齊集，各區救火車相率前來，始極力將火勢撲滅，交通至八時許始吿完全恢復。</p>
<h3>班底待遇指數計薪　五劇院損失三萬萬　千元一諾歡然解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天蟾·黃金·中國·大舞台及共舞台五平劇院班底胡待遇糾紛，由社會局召集勞資雙方於昨日下午三時在局調解，商談至六時圓滿解決，當塲簽訂筆錄。</p>
<p>昨日資方出席代表爲平劇院聯誼會理事長周劍星，中國大戲院汪其俊，一黃金大戲院周禧如，共舞台張善珊，大舞台范恒裕，天蟾舞合唐平凡。勞方出席代表爲馬慶雲·邱王成·吳四寳·柏文亮·局振和·沈季生。社會局派　夢松出席主持。</p>
<p>三項條件</p>
<p>除商討關於工資折合底薪依生活指數計算問題外，資方復提出三項條件：　賠償四日晚各戲院之損失。　職工登報道歉。　停演晚之職工工資照扣。經　夢松局間勸導再三商談，職工先登報道歉。停演晚工資照扣一點，因職工收入有限，經商得資方同意，由職工共出一百萬元捐助平劇院聯誼會及伶界聯合會各半。關於賠償五戲院因停羅損失三億元一點，雙方爭執頗烈，職工因收入微薄，根本無力負祖。周劍星稱，雖明知職工無力賠償，然即使賠一元亦可。周言畢，勞方代表馬慶雲即自袋中掬出中央銀行一千元之法幣一紙，聲稱代表全體職工賠償。周照樣伸手接受。全室　之一片歡笑及鼓掌聲，勞資雙方即在此融治空氣中簽訂　録。</p>
<p>商定底薪</p>
<p>根據規定，雙方同意　　之底薪如下，凡工資在七十萬以下者一律折合底薪，十月份爲四十元，十一月份爲四十二元，以後不得再行變更。如超出七十萬元者，以七十萬爲基數，折合爲四十二元，其餘按當月指數類推，以原薪二百萬元爲限。</p>
<p>又將漲價</p>
<p>又據周劍星及汪其俊向記者表示，此次職工待遇調整後，支出較前增加百分之七十五，故票價亦將予以調整。唯目前娛樂事業己處於困境中，調整票價不能過高，否則營業將更不易開展。</p>
<h3>董家渡盜刦殺人　雀戰正酣突來暴客　萬盛醬園死傷三人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚九時許，南市董家渡南區街一〇九號萬盛醬園，突來身穿　　制服之盜匪一名，出示木壳槍，時店堂中有胡士基（卅歲上海入住復善堂街），黃福榮（四十歲本地人住硝皮弄）等正在雀戰，常被攔入左側一室內，（係保長辦公室）因胡等大聲呼援，該盜即發槍數響，彈中胡黃兩人要害，應聲路地身死。流彈並傷學徒張鳳葆（廿一歲崇明人）左腿。盜在賬桌上攫取法幣若干，因不敢由大門外出，即　登屋頂，跳入鄰舍而逸。此時董家渡派出所已據報，繆巡官即報吿蓬萊警分局，同時飭派全體便莖制服警保警中隊等馳往，總局得報，亦飭摩托軍隊賈隊長督率警員四十名，趕往包圍。直至今最一時許，警員尙在搜查中，據悉已在附近拘獲嫌疑人　警一名。</p>

<h3>商號宣告破產所欠稅欵　應與一般債權平均分配　司法院統一解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於商號因營業不良，而依法宣吿破產，其欠納稅款應如何追繳一案，前經財政部於本年二月兩請司法院解釋後，據覆：「茲經本院統一解釋法令會議議決，納稅義務人受破產宣吿時，其在破產宣告前所欠之稅，由破產法第一百另三條第一款之規定推之，非不得爲破產債權，此項破產債權，如法律別無優先受償之規定，自應與其他破產債權平均分配」等語。簡言之，凡商店破產後，其所欠稅捐，倘法律上別無「優先受償」之規定，則應與一般債權平均分配，反之，則應先將所欠政府之稅捐，悉數淸償後，方能償付其他倩務。現本市財政局即擬酌量實施云。</p>

<h3>少婦艶裝謾藏誨盜　三輪車夫見義勇為　劇盜槍傷兩人　卒被擊倒擒獲　查係過犯出獄未久</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新閘路東斯文里七號，住有少婦江陳鵑。昨晨十時五十分，　裝携筐至陳家浜小菜塲購菜，腕　金鐲二枚，爲盜匪所見，迨其返寓，正擬路入七號後門時，即被兩盜上前刦奪金　，納入衣袋中，婦放聲大呼，致觸盜怒，開槍一　，彈中左腿踣地，共時有隣居六十八歲老叟唐阿生見狀，協助呼喊，致亦爲彈片擦傷左踝部。二盜見已肇禍，拔步飛逸，甫至弄外，即爲一三榆車夫蔣榮生在後力追，沿新閘路由西朝東，折入成都北路，沿途民衆助追者殊多。斯時成都路派出所崗警一五四五號周吉汀聞訊，亦隨衆追捕，迨抵成都路，一盜卒被蔣榮生趕上抱住，該盜即連發二槍，射中蔣之右臂和臀部，痛極釋手，一五四五號崗警乃迎發六彈，將該執槍之盜擊倒，計中左腿小腹二槍，擒住後，幷奪下所執之快慢機槍一支，檢査膛內，尙餘十彈十五發。時另一盜已被乘混亂中遁去。同時該管新成警分局已據報，由丁副分局長率股員顧啟關·警長馬仁勇·趙永吉等大批幹警承警備車趕到調査之後，亟將受傷事主及見義勇爲三輪車夫蔣榮生先送醫院醫治，至受傷之悍匪，帶局偵訊，據供名唐如友，卅二歲，南通人，向在原書籍務農，四年前曾投入匪軍為班長，新近來滬云云。後據警員檢査其指紋，發覺曾犯盜案二次，判處徒刑十年，甫於上月期滿釋放，遂將其送警察醫院施治，至被刦之金鐲一對，仍被逸盜携走，現正在追緝中。</p>

<h3>滬國民黨黨部　舉行盛大茶會　歡迎張治中蔣經國程天放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬國民黨黨部各區分黨部於昨日午後三時，假警察聯歡社舉行盛大茶會，歡迎張治中·蔣經國·程天放等。到各界人士六百人以上，吳國　·吳開先·　叔平等均出席參加。由方治主席致歡迎　後，即由張治中致詞，謂來滬小作休憩，軍事外交均不便談，在滬看過話劇「美男子」及「假　虛　」，甚爲幽默輕鬆，並暗示兩點做人道理：「即老實人雖有小虧吃，最後終佔便宜」及「如能破除虛偽，任何問題終能解決。」並稱：「黨團合併爲一英明偉大之措施，希望同志間能互諒互讓互信，使黨成爲一純潔革命性之團體。今日火敵當前，不容再閙糾紛與摩擦，寗可個人吃小虧，不可使革命吃大虧，誠能如此，則目前之諜重時期，必能很快過去。」</p>
<p>造成革命新上海</p>
<p>張氏辭畢，繼請蔣經國致詞，蔣氏略謂舉命來滬辦理黨團合併，當以學習態度處理一切。個人足跡遍全國，最喜歡迪化，最不喜歡上海。但上海究爲我國之心臟，必須建立新精神，造成革命的新上海。程天放致詞，則詳述在美觀感，謂在好的方面，美國交通與電訊發展驚人，生產技術日新月異，而戰後大學生數量激增，全國專科以上學生達三百萬人之多，較之戰前大數倍，高等敎育如此普及對於未來之社會，尤有深遠之影響。其國民生活程度之高，尤非他國所能比擬，平均每人每年以入在一千三百美金，國民所得之高，令人欣羨。現美國之失業總數不過五十萬人，不足爲社會安全之威脅。</p>
<p>美社會有其缺點</p>
<p>但在另一方面，美國社會亦有其缺點，舉其要者如：　浪費物資，　社會道德低落，犯罪行爲增加，尤以幼年犯罪激增，更爲可　現象。據美政府統計，去年一年中之幼年犯罪者達二十萬起，殊足驚人。　物價上漲不已，迄未能加以控制，工潮時時發生，據專家推測不景氣恐不能避免。程氏至此復將美國對華態度詳加分析，指出美國近對我國之誤解及　　，實由於下列各種原因：　美共及中共在美國長期而有組織之惡意宣傳，　美新聞記者戰時在我國陪都深受物質生活之苦，對戰時新聞檢査制尤爲深痛疾惡，故返國後作種種不利於我之　　。且在今日之美國，唯有批評我國之著作，方可名利雙收。例如美記者Woodvaw　White本無　　名、　　返國後寫「中國之　　」一書，內容對我國盡情曲解，　能暢銷四五十萬本，一舉成名。</p>
<p>致詞時之張治中（本報攝）</p>
<p>應加強對美宣傳</p>
<p>美陸空軍人員戰時在華服務者，均感物質生活之苦，而發生不滿情緖，返國後常有於我不利之言論。　美政府官吏中頗多左傾人士，往往故意公佈不利於我國之文件，而對有利於我者，拒不發表。　我國旅美人士之反政府宣傳，此類人士包括高級官吏及交換　授等，於政府信用損害甚大。猶　　林斯登大學二百週年紀念時，會舉行遠東問題演講，我國某教授此評政府之猛烈，遠過於美人之批評我國政府，當地報紙認爲重要新聞。同時另一方面，我國在海外之宣傳機構，對政府之政策及國民黨之主義立塲，從未有積極性之　揚，此亦為美國人士對我誤解之一因。惟程氏認為此種情形，不必悲觀，而應體量加強中美間之宣傳聯絡，以糾正美國朝鮮對我之錯誤印象。大會至五時許，在和　空氣中始告結束。</p>

<h3>淄博　礦區　復員中遭遇的困難</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南二日航訊〕此次淄博之行，所給我的概括印象是：「走是走的　王道，喝是喝的麵糊湯，住是住的寡婦莊」。</p>
<p>所謂「走是走的閣王道」，一方面是指公路之壞到簡直令人不能想像，我們的六輪道奇大卡車走在上面，正如同水牛在水田裏耕田一樣的遲慢而吃力。如我們第一天費了廿五加侖汽油濟南走到龍山總共只是卅五公里，翻了一次車，和不下十餘次幾乎要翻車，大家都在提高警覺，準備隨時到閻王老爺處註册，此其一。其二，沿途兩側土八路仍時常出沒，我們參觀南定輕金屬工廠時　遇到共匪襲擊，在張店周村之間的芽莊又遇到規模更大的襲擊。當我們的車尚未到芽莊之前的馬尚莊時，車就</p>
<p>陷入泥淖</p>
<p>不能自拔，好容易找到許多木板，迎拖帶拉，開出了泥坑，及至芽莊，莊在小淸河一支流上，正碰上共匪已將橋上石板搬走數塊，準備裝信管，埋地雷，幸而車子早到幾分鐘，雷未及埋，五六十個土八路聽到汽車馬達響，就向河兩側靑紗帳裏藏，更幸運的是車在過河時，我們都下了車，不然，如匪集中向車上射擊時，就難免沒有死傷，但不奉的是我們所帶的廿幾個兵是工兵團各連雜凑而成，表面上由一連指導員統率，臨危時不聽指揮，各自逃命，而僅帶的兩挺輕機關槍又因射手心慌，子彈脫了簧，一顆也打不出來，於是，常我們的車子剛過河，河兩面高粱田裏的匪集中火力向我們射擊時，我們的兵除掉亂放了一陣步槍外，大家只落得衝出重圍，各自奔命，這樣狂奔了五六里外始算進入安全區，當天到周村時，據說在同一地點，前後被搶刧的還鄉難民凡五批，共卅餘人，死二，傷三，被俘五，老百姓沒有武力做了難民還被刧，這不是閻王路是什麼呢？</p>
<p>我沿途所經村莊，目擊老百姓的生活水準已被壓低到不能再低，每天喝的是麩皮，小米麵，高粱粉等所雜凑成的湯，這種湯，無以名之，只可名之曰「麵糊湯」。而在沿途各村莊裏，除掉老頭子和成羣的精光裸體的小孩以外，只是女人，問起他們的「掌櫃」（山東人對丈夫的通稱），不說：「逃往濟南尚未歸來」，就說已被八路殺死或被八路擄走了！這情形，不是</p>
<p>寡婦莊</p>
<p>又是什麽呢？但據剛由沂蒙山區進駐博山的聯勤總部周支部長樑告訴我：「能够有寡婦莊住還算好的，在沂蒙山區裏往往數百里不見人烟，不見一完屋，野草長得比樹還要長，遠比往年贛南瑞金興國還要凄慘上十倍」。</p>
<p>由於魯中一帶原有地方武力於今春萊蕪之役撤退時，因經費無着，都被一律改編爲省保安團，此次復員後所有保安團不一定能駐原縣，因此，地方武力遂甚單薄，由後方回鄉復員的難民即幸而通過了閻王路，除掉各城的可以回家外，其餘原住鄉間的到了縣城依然不能還鄉，情形比較好</p>
<p>一點的亦只是白天回家，晚上仍回城裏居住，這其中主要的原因乃是整個鄕間廣大的面仍是土八路的世界，共匪且爲「保護貧農所分得的鬥爭果實」，在各地組纖了「保家大隊」，同時爲便利其作戰，嚴禁民衆斬割高粱，如違處死，而各地農作物，雖告　收，農民仍多</p>
<p>徘徊觀望</p>
<p>不敢收割，縣政府所原有的一套鄕鎭保甲長，至此自亦多住城內，不敢下鄕，如此政令不僅無法推行，並形成道般在後方的難民到了本縣仍依然是難民的怪現象。（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>監院報吿書全文　（上接第二版）　全文　（戊）汽車進口情形之調査</h3>
<p>自抗戰勝利還都以後，京滬各地華麗汽車，日見增加，在此節約雞國時期，有此現象，不免爲各方所指摘，查此等汽車，除敵僞時代公家及私人所存留者外，兩年以來陸續由下列來源輸入，　在去年三月四日以前，因一切物資均自由進口，旣無限額，亦無限價，故在此期中，私人向國外購人之華貴汽車甚多。　自去年三月四日以後，禁止出廠價格在美金一千二百元以上之汽車入口，同時限制廠價在美金一千二百元以下之汽車入口，計去年冬季共計核准進口汽車一，二五一輛，共値美金一，八〇六，九二四，〇〇元，分配於中外商號四十六家，其中以福特公司最多，計三八二輛，値美金五〇〇，九八四，〇〇元，（詳附件十八），本年春季停止進口，本年夏季共核定進口汽車五百輛，亦以福特最多。　行政院特准進口汽車，計有兩案，第一案爲宋前院長令中央信託局購進新舊轎車一百九十輛案，中信於卅五年七月九日接華盛頓物資供應委員會電稱：「宋院長授權在美洽購汽車運滬，並報告數飛到局」，當經中信局簽准行政院秘書處通知交由該局代為辦理，分配各機關購用，報由有政院核定支配，准予結購外匯美金五十萬元，並電財政部，飭知關務署轉飭江海關准予進口，同時中信局叉奉行政院宋前院長上年八月二日電，飭於該項汽車運滬時隨時具報，由院統籌分配，九月廿七日由中信局以國幣一十六億八千五百萬元，向巾央銀行按當時三三五零元折合美金匯率，於九月間結得美金五十萬元，共折合法幣一十六億八千五百萬元，此項汽車截至廿六年六月十六日止，共到新車九十八輛，舊車卅輛未到，新車六十二輛已到之車，均已分配（宋前院長任內分配），未到之車，預爲分配十九輛，只餘四十三輛尚未分配（現在陸續運到汽車卅七輛，只餘六輛未到，由現任張院長分配與各機關使用），所有已分配之汽車，其屬於中央黨政機關者，則有國民政府·行政·司法·考試·立法·監察五院·國防部·中央黨部卅餘單位，其屬於各地方機關學校者，則有十一戰區·江蘇·甘肅·南京·杭州等省市政府及北京·淸華各大學等十餘單位，其屬於私人或私人附有官銜稱謂者（即機關首長），則有宋子文先生·黃　白夫人·李石曾先生·蔣秘書長夢麟·孔委員·白部長·朱副秘書長忠道·朱參事光沐·陳秘書康齊·江參事季平·尹秘書仲容·許參事世　等（均爲行政院參秘）等卅餘人，其屬於社會團體者，則有中央婦運會，中國紅十字會兩單位，（均詳附表十一），因査行政院檔案並無購進汽車定案原卷，其有關此案之卷宗，只有報告車別數字牌號，請購機關私人函牘，與分配數量等而已，旣無定案之原文，究竟分配辦法如何，某機關應分配與不分配，應分配若干機關首長，以及私人社團具備某種條件始得分配，均無明白合理之規定，遂致分配之時漫無標準，以意爲之，有分配與各機關者有分配與各機關首長者，有分配與私人社團者，又有分配與行政院少數參事秘書者，其分配與各機關之汽車，自係公物，列入交代，其分配與機關首長之汽車，如首長變動，是否留交後任使用，已成問題，而分配與私人或社會團體，乃至行政院少數參秘之汽車，爲其私有，常無疑問，試思行政院非政府營業機關，其購進之汽車，物美價廉，僅折合法幣一千萬元上下，市價比此高出十倍以上，如儘數分配與各機關公用，任何中外商人必無閒言，而行政院除分配與各機關外，竟以五分之二，分配與機關首長私人社團參秘，於法實有未合，第二案爲本年六月新綏公司向行政院請求特准進口卡車八百輛，經行政院秘書處函請輸入臨時管理委員會核辦，該會於七月七日輸書第四三六二號函復：「以卡車係屬附表　（乙）暫停進口貨品，目奉鈞院特令暫停進口，復以新綏公司總經理朱炳，於本年八月二十六日呈稱：該批車輛價款，連同運費，約美金一，九〇〇元，八百輛共約美金一百五十餘萬元，請准由指定銀行，按掛牌市價出售，上述八百部車輛之美金外匯，行政院以該公司前稱自備外匯，今又請購外匯，前後矛盾，乃一面批復該公司、追詢：「究竟該項汽車八百輛價款已否籌撥完畢，仰即翔實呈復憑核」，一面於九月十二日急電輸出入管理委員會，命「暫緩發給許可證，另候通知」。（原卷存行政院。）至此，該批卡東之特准入口，尚成懸案。査政府旣已禁止一般汽車入口於前，今復大批特准入口於後，政令威信，自受不良影響，今後此類事實，應請行政院予以注意。（詳附件十一）。　按照規定：凡私人出國返國時，可以隨同行李帶回舊汽車一部，其標準以曾經使用半年以上，係折舊價格在一千二百美金以下，並領有使用牌照者爲限。年餘以來，以出國回國人員甚多，故此項車輛，自勝利後至本年八月底止，共計入口一八六〇輛之多，且大都爲華麗轎軍，並有一部份人設法藉此入口，而轉售牟利者，今後宜有更嚴厲之取締辦法，或根本禁止此類車輛入口。　各國在華使領人員來華時，得以自用名義，携帶汽車入口，至八月底止計一百七十四輛。　抗戰期中及兩年來，換防來華之美國官兵，以軍用關係携來之吉普車及卡車甚多，中途或返國時，有以轉議與機關或個人者，（無詳數可査。）　聯總及行總在其運輸來華之物資內，包括有吉普車及卡車，以備救濟運輸之中，且有一部份正式出售者。　自香港走私運輸入華南華中一帶之汽軍。以上八點，爲形成今日京滬各地汽車充斥之原因。關於商民購買卡車，暫停進口，行政院及海關執行情形如下：　卅五年四月廿日行政院節伍字第一二五五四號訓令：「商人在國外訂購之卡車，除已在途者外，不准進口」。經海關於四月廿九日，以五十一號布告施行。　同年五月十八月，行政院京伍巧代電：「如四月廿九日以前，向國外訂購之卡車，以現款或押匯付淸購價，並向海關提出證明者，仍准進口」，經海關於五月廿三日以五十五號佈告施行。　以外商對於上述命令，紛紛抗議，經總稅務司往返請示結果，乃於十月九日由海關以八十號布告：「凡在四月廿九日以前訂購，於此次布告日前已起運在途者，權准通融進口」。（詳附件十二），査上項命令，屢作變更，雖云爲顧全國際貿易習慣，然商民則無所適從，而社會上亦易滋誤會。（下接明日第二版）</p>

<p>布疋飛騰</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開盤旋，嗣至十點半後，陽光細布靑島帮搜吸，北帮則進深色各布，並傳外匯又將調整，利買空氣籠罩市場，一片喊買聲，行情再告飛騰。迨至最後，龍頭各檔細布一致狂升六萬五至七八萬元，其他漂布粗布元布嗶嘰直貢士林等布，價均比週六上漲自三五萬至十萬元不一。</p>

<h3>股買氣旺盛·永紗創新高價</h3>
<p>華股昨受物價之蠶動，買氣更爲興奮，惟一部份活動份子，轉向洋股打出路，是以華股雖漲而籌碼未免鬆動，漲來十分吃力。後市長空頭二一二號，突來補進，於是永紗越出三百元大關而創高價。</p>
<p>農開</p>
<p>見秀，開後永紗升至即交二八五元，遞交二九〇元。隔週浮多獲利出籠而告回，然因有三一號一八〇號之力購現永紗，二二三號等進遞永紗，中途有盤，八五號等了結遞永紗，一四八號等拋賣現永紗，塲外息價仍開二角二分半及二角七，曾將永紗迫低至即交二八〇元，遞交二八三元。一五七號等不時購買，紗布匯三者齊飛，塲外喊高甚多，近午逐步漲到二九三元，此時除永紗外，餘股成奄然無生氣，逢高有一七三號等之供給，小挫至二八八元，終以大戶集中全力向永紗進襲，九四號等速袂收買，臨收時即交漲達二九〇元，遞交二九四元半，而後以二九〇元及二九三元之價收市。結果較上週六計即交股新華漲成半，永紗信和美亞勤興水泥新光商務中絲榮豐升半成，景福華豐火柴景綸統益中紡中興恒豐小升，餘尚見平。遞交股計新光華豐景福微升，永紗信和美亞勤典漲半成。</p>
<p>後巿</p>
<p>二二三號等俱進，商務由一六三號，新華由一七二號，水泥由四〇號，掛高至漲停板，永紗乃穿出三〇〇元大關。八四號等脫手而稍盤，二一二號大事補空，三一號猛購現永紗，三五號等通袂吸收，一五二號二三七號亦扒即交，美亞信和現交均曾迫停，國行交換差出而漲到即交三〇九元，遞交三一三元新高價，二二三號等乘高了結，盤低至三〇三元左右，三一號力購即交永紗，五四號一九九號尚買，臨收在三〇五元左右掙扎。結果較晨收計即交般永紗信和美亞華豐景福統益中紡升半成，景綸麗安漲一成，中興平平，新華水泥商務漲達限度，餘均微漲。遞交股永紗信和新光景福微升，美亞華豐各升半成光景，場外各老股除世界巾華大生微升外，餘見穩定。</p>
<p>勤興昨開股東會，通過贈三認四增資辦法。</p>
<h3>統債回挫外股高漲</h3>
<p>公債昨已開始回跌，統丙晨開一六二〇〇元，自一六三〇〇元盤低至一四三〇〇元左右結束，五五二室二三〇室有買，三六〇室五五五室均售，結果較上週六計甲乙丁各跌一千三，丙挫一千八，戊低五百元，成交不過三百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨大批游資參加搜羅，證券帮二二四號亦來吸納，黑市橫行，買風擴大，熱股均創新高價，橡皮股更有改票面及發息刺激，所昂更多。怡紗自一四五〇〇〇元漲到一六五〇〇〇元，英聯目一八三〇〇〇元升至二〇〇〇〇〇元外，會德　自三二〇〇〇〇元起，盤升至三八〇〇〇〇元高價收市。金號·紗花·洋商·廣帮都扒，散戶則出。結果較上週除集廣升半成强外，餘股均昂一成至二成强不等。</p>
<h3>行局雖有差出暗息仍喊二角</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差出一七〇億元，惟各業資金，因物價波動，均傾向搜購物寳，致暗息仍喊二角，華股塲外多方貼息則再減至二角七分。昨日中央出一〇一億元，大交換入三五六億元，外商入二三五億元，小交換出六二一億元。</p>
<p>其他行局，中國出三六億元，交通入一三億元，中農出四五億元，中信入二五億元，郵匯出二二億元，合作金庫出三億元。</p>
<h3>受物價動盪影響食米油餅一致上升</h3>
<p>雜糧高挺生仁暴漲十萬元</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬八千五百餘石，市勢因內地回升，運費增價，場外各種物價動盪甚烈。食米油餅雜糧一致上升，粳米回漲一二萬元，秈米猛加二三萬元，窰種百哥猛漲三萬元，白元亦加萬元。</p>

<h3>愛倫坡及其作品</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>愛氏逝世九十年祭</p>
<p>在美國許多知名的文學巨人中，愛倫坡（Edgan　Allan　Poe）是比較傑出的，他的一生雖然是放蕩而潦倒，但他的作品却具有一種卓越的風格。他的詩與小說都寫世界文　所推祟，曾被　　成十餘種文字。</p>
<p>愛伽·愛倫坡以一八〇九年一月十九日生於馬蕯諸塞州的波士頓．他的父母都是　　的伶人，行踪飄忽；在他三歲以前就全都棄他而死去了。隨後他爲他的叔父約翰·愛倫所收養作義子，遂在他的原名愛伽坡上加上了「愛倫」的姓字。愛倫坡自幼就天資敏　，先後在英格蘭與維金尼亞州的里區曼城　書；他的叔父是一個里城的大烟草商，家財豪富，足有餘力來扶植這一個孤兒。一八二六年他就被送入維金尼亞大學唸書，在學校裏他的天才很爲敎授們所賞識，拉了文與法文都得到極榮譽的奬評。</p>
<p>他於十五歲（一八二四年）就開始寫詩，在大學裏他已能寫出一手好詩了。可惜他生活太放蕩，常常酗酒與賭博，以至於有一次在年終時負了二千五百元的賭債，這筆賭債雖然是由他的叔父償付了，但他也從此失去了求學的機會。後來他又在車隊裏與西點軍校服役，但終因他不能檢束自己的私生活而被開革。一八三五年，他去里區曼城的「南方文學前驅報」祖任助理編輯，這期間他在該刊上發表了許多詩與小說，因此他的文名大震。</p>
<p>他在波士頓成爲一個名人了；一八三六年他就與京雷蒙小姐結婚，婚後生活極爲愉快。只是他放蕩不　的性格依舊未改，終於又失去了他的職位。此後他與他夫人行踪無定，直到一八四四年才卜居於紐約。他曾辦過一張日報，但不久就因經濟結據而停刊。一八四七年他的夫人去世，此後他就爲憂悒所包圍，雖然他也曾一度整肅過自己的生活，但終因生活放蕩，酗酒過甚而死去。他死於一八四九年十月七日，死時還只四十歲。</p>
<p>愛倫坡的全集有好幾種版本，其中較普通的，是亨利·凡·特克所　的，全集共十冊，包括文學批評小說，詩各部門。他底小說可分爲二種；一種是用科學的綿密的推理，去解決偵探事件的，代表作是「麥根街之殺人」（The　Murders　in　the　RuedMorgue）與「金甲虫」（TheGole　Bug）等；另一種是神秘的，　想的，代表作是「威廉·威爾遜」（Wiliam　Wilson）與「奧雪爾家的衰落」（TheFall　of　the　Houseof　Usher）等。其他著名的小說，尙有「里奇亞」（Legeia）「阿蒙梯拉社底木桶」（TheCask.of　Amontilado），「黑貓」（The　Black　Cate），「告發的心」（The　Tell-Tale　Hert）…等。他小說的文體，曾是深深地影響了西歐諸國的作家們。</p>
<p>愛倫坡的詩更是後來美國詩歌的先導，具有極大的價値。差不多與愛氏同時的幾位法國詩人與小說家，波特萊爾與高地亞，都非常推崇他的詩。波特萊爾甚至將愛氏的一篇「詩的要義」（Poetical　Princiles）奉爲最佳的詩論。後人都批評波特萊爾的傑作「惡之華」是深受了他的影響。愛倫坡最出名的詩作是「大鴉」（The　Raven）代表他那種神秘而深刻的作風，與「大鴉」作風相近的尚有「鐘」（TheBells），「海裏的城市」（TheCity　in　The　Sea），「睡者」（TheSleepers）…等，愛氏另有一種抒情的詩，亦爲舉世讀者所稱道，其中最出名的是「安納裴·麗」（Annabel　Lee）其一他尚有「給海倫」（To　Helen），「列娜」（Lenore）「給一個在天國中的愛人」（To　One　inPanaoise）等篇。他的文學批評亦很嚴正而鋒利，在常時佔有很高的地位。</p>
<p>許多不同的批評家，國內的與國外的，當時的與後世的，都一致地承認他有創作的天才。他的作品裏有一種熱情和光輝，爲這種熱情與光輝的來源，是含在他愛感覺，愛色彩和愛活潑的條件裏的。固然有少數批評家惡意地批評他的作品過於象徵與頹廢，但他的作品終究是光芒萬丈地留傳下來永垂於不朽。（愛氏肖像已載六月十八日本刊—編者）</p>
<h3>小草與石塊</h3>
<p>— 葛尙德</p>
<p>小草</p>
<p>晚上，偶然跑到面街的廊廡。淡眉一樣的月亮浮上遠處的屋頂，給雲幕掩住了，讓街燈映照這廊廡的全面。究竟爭節已是輪到初秋，晚風習習，迎燈光也似帶有些凉意。</p>
<p>把視綫悠然地向四周移動，那底下街道上的深夜寥落的行人，那遠處巨厦的糢糊的輪廓，那互厦中的點點燈光，逐一映入眼簾。然後回過頭來，看看白　的牆，和那從三樓屋　倚着牆壁下垂的鐵製水管。這時，一　小草，突然吸引了我的視力。</p>
<p>這一叢小草，生植在水管的接縫處。大概除掉從街頭飛揚起來的泥　，和下雨時從屋頂上隨着雨水下注的塵埃之外，再沒有什麽可資營義的資料了。但是，它是生得那麽蓬勃，那麼葱翠，那麽嫵媚，那麽有勁。</p>
<p>對於這樣一個奇迹似的存在，定然沒有人注意的，當然更不會有人給與憐惜和愛撫了。但是，它也已經邁過了春夏二季。它有着欣欣向榮的生命歷程，它也有着茁壯輝煌的黃金時代。它有　　的記憶作伴，它大概不會感到寂寞。</p>
<p>我向這　小草凝視了良久良久。它的綠色的枝葉，在街燈的光映照下，閃閃亮。它似乎在傲視蔚水管，牆壁，周遭的一切，連原想慷慨地給它以一點憐憫的我在內。</p>
<p>我默默地離開了廊廡。</p>
<p>石塊</p>
<p>每次走過那條里弄，我總要諦視一會那些　成路面的石塊。</p>
<p>它們是經受了無數無數的人們和車輛的踐踏的：小販，商賈，市民，馬車，三輪車，以及汽車。它們已經被布履，皮鞋，車輪磨折成平坦和光滑了。這平坦和光滑，便是它們歷盡滄桑的紀錄。</p>
<p>但是，它們不會歎息，它們也有着無數光榮的回憶，來供作陶醉的資料。在若干年若干年之前，它們正是雄渾山嶽的一環。它們　立在山巔，與明月爲伴，與淸風爲友。山濤在爲它們奏樂，浮雲在禮讚它們的堅碩　它們傲然仰視着穹天，又傲然俯　着大地。它們是純潔而且孤傲的。</p>
<p>不知在那一年那一天，它們被石匠斫伐了下來，經受了一番支解，最後被運到這裹鋪塡了路面。</p>
<p>這也無傷於它們過往的光榮。</p>
<p>而且，在今日的被踐踏之中，它們也正有着精神上的愉悅。每天在用着舌尖，細細嘗味着路人的氣息，它們明白了誰是應予咒詛的和誰是値得讚美的。它們有着强烈的恨和愛。它們引咒詛爲愉悅，同時也以唱　美歌爲樂事。</p>
<p>我也不禁爲石塊禮　了。</p>
<h3>花腔</h3>
<p>— 高歌</p>
<p>人力車</p>
<p>他出了一筆錢，由我走路，他不必動步，而他到了。</p>
<p>梭哈</p>
<p>胆大的　胆小的，腰包充實的　虛有其表的。</p>
<p>那一張仆着的紙牌，不但掩蓋了它自己的面目，也掩蓋了座中人的誠實，友情，以及理智。</p>
<p>天天在　塲合裏逗留逗留，　包充實的也漸漸歸入虛有其表的一類了，於是即或曾爲胆大英雄的人也漸成了胆小的需夫。</p>
<p>茶館</p>
<p>這是個離奇的地方，備了那麼大量的開水供給靈魂，空虛時間空虛的人塡灌那並不空虛的腸胃。</p>
<p>然而被灌滿了腸胃的人，靈魂與時間却依然空虛。</p>
<p>慷慨</p>
<p>把撤下的耀汚給拿去作肥料。</p>
<p>把耗子打來喂貓吃。</p>
<p>把自己咬不動的骨頭　給狗啃。</p>
<p>吸了一萬個人的血，抺下　角染着的一點，給別人聞一聞腥味。</p>
<p>你的是我的，我的也是——我的。</p>
<p>酒席</p>
<p>給吃得很好的人多迭一些吃得更好的機會，</p>
<p>給活在「魚獵時代」的人能够活下去了，因爲他們貢獻了山珍海味。</p>
<p>慰官迷詞</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>北邊有句市語：「十個土混子，抵不了一個京油子；十個京油子，抵不了一個衛嘴子！」這衛嘴子指的天津人，這句市語，表示天津人的嘴頭厲害。據說，像四川人擺龍門陣似的，你要是想從天津人口裏叨敎一句話，他可以跟你說上三天三宿，說得頭頭是道；臨了，仍舊呌你聽了。還是莫明其妙。</p>
<p>耀羣不大　悉天津情形，偌大一個天津，耀羣只是一隻孤雁似的。况且這時的天津，市區之外，還有零碎槍砲和飛機轟炸的聲　，市內人心惶惶，可說草木皆兵；一句話說得不對，霎時就是滔天大禍。這麼一來，每個「衛　子」早把那「嘴」上了封條了，牙縫裏那裏肯漏半個字出來？耀羣略一沉吟，便想到一個入手盤問的方式。</p>
<p>「討厭！」　羣回身朝屋子裏走了兩步，把這兩個字說得很響，眼睛瞧着穿堂長凳上坐着的那兩位招待，自曾自語似的。這是一篇八股的破題。緊接，她豐起雙眉，又微微含着些笑意，冲着一們年齡較長的招待點了點頭：「勞您駕，我得麻煩您給我換間屋子！」</p>
<p>「換間屋子？」這是招待的職務，不能不說話：「跟您大姑娘說，您那問屋子，數這底層最好的一間；又大，又明亮，又透風，哪一條都好。再說二樓三樓，哪一間屋子也不及咱們這底層涼快。這麽大熱天，您……」</p>
<p>「不換也成。要不您把牌子給取消，只當屋子沒人住……」耀羣天眞爛漫地一笑，「您知道，我害怕有人來麻煩……</p>
<p>「取消牌子？」招待早搖着頭：「一層，這是咱們這小店的規矩；　出屋子，就得寫脾子。二層，不掛牌，萬一又有人來，指定這間屋子，咱們還是　，還是不　？……大姑娘讀書明理，不是嗎？……再說，怕人麻煩，那是您自家兒的事；您愛理，理；不愛理，不理！……」</p>
<p>「不成！」耀羣抓住了這句話：「愛理不理嗎？像剛才這一位呌什麼買什麼夫的，想必是您貴店什麽……什麽……耀羣存心要　他一冤。</p>
<p>「她呀？……　！……您是說剛才那個穿四服的娘兒們，那個三分像人，七分鬼怪的玩意兒？……她與小店，毫無關係，可是您得對付着點兒，不理不成！」這位招待也許不是天津人？倒是心直口快似的。</p>
<p>「因爲什麼？」耀羣不肯　囌，只這麼提撥式的問了一句，省得打斷了他的興致。</p>
<p>「她是給日本人當調査員的……」</p>
<p>「嗐，調査員，就是她媽的偵探狗！……」這人的嗓十更大。從旁補充了這一句；「偵探狂」三個字，並且是恨恨不已地咬着的牙縫　迸出來的。這是那第二立招待。說着，還對　羣用力地點了一個頭，加軍他說話的力量。</p>
<p>這人的補充，給耀羣吃了一大驚，不只是大驚，還透着詫異，也不只詫異，詫異之中還混合　高興，快樂；這高興快樂，又似乎有些過了頭，　地侵入了一股莫名的感觸，差一點感動得掉下淚來。</p>

<h3>廣島——是和平城？</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>譯者按：美國生活雜誌九月號刊載了這篇關於日本城市的文字，很足以說明戰後的日本怎樣在謀取復興之道，美國的資本家們又怎樣的帮助他們，是不是値得我們一　的呢？　八月六日，兩年前的這天，是歷史上第一顆原子彈正式應用於戰爭的日子，它的威力摧殘了整個廣島，日本人除了對廣島的居民表示深深的哀悼外，祇有感到驚奇而已。</p>
<p>現在，一個傳奇式的故事在廣島展開，日本人認爲它將成爲和平的新世界，他們在這裏種植了一棵樟腦樹，按照日本的舊俗，這是長生的象徵，他們爲此日夜祈　着。整齊的街道顯示着廣島已自死亡中復活過來，日本人民有意思把這個曾經毀滅了的城市，搬回到地圖上去，他們的口號是：「忘記過去的戰爭，看我們以後的！」</p>
<p>假使以步行作譬喩，那末廣島的復興該是驚人的「高視闊步」了，曾經從二十五萬人銳减到十七萬五千人的廣島，已漸增至二十一萬人；六萬幢房屋被破壞於戰爭中，替代的是二萬三千幢新的建築；商店的開設帮助了廣島的繁榮，雖然一切都还沒有達到戰前的程度，可是，僅僅二年的時間，要在一塊廢墟的土地上建立起一個新的城市，這種精神連美國人也都感到佩服，看一個駐在廣島的美國將領的話：「我們不知道什麼是眞正的原動力，使他們這麼興奮的工作，我所熟悉的都是廣島的居民，或許他們需要和平……。」</p>
<p>的確，今日的廣島人民正在埋頭苦幹着，他們一個遠大的理想—全市人民共同的目標，能够在一個和平的慶祝日中，使破碎了的廣島完全復原，他們不想把它造成一個「理想樂園中的烏托邦廣島」，不過，他們要盡最大的力量，把它形成一塊最美麗的土他，日本的要塞。</p>
<p>廣島種種的改造，完全做　美國的式樣，街道，店面，高樓大　，一切的一切都與美國的城市相似，關於這些，美國人很願意在這裏投資金元，與日本人携手起來，建設新的廣島。</p>
<p>今年的「廣島日」（八月六日），廣島曾經舉行了一次隆重簡單的儀式，市長親自在樟腦樹下植土，樹上高懸一塊木牌，上面刻着：「樹乃和平Peace　treein　menorial」。正在兩年前那天原子彈爆發的時刻，整個的廣島響澈着紀念鐘聲，日本老嫗們拭淚哀悼着她們的子女。高級女子學校的學生，穿着整齊的海軍　白色的制服低吟「和平頌」。小孩們表演着竹槍閱兵典禮（竹是生長極速的預兆），日本的母親們深信她們的孩子，會生長得像竹一樣。其他的學生們，爲了籌募戰時孤兒們的　金，出動銷售紀念章。</p>
<p>廣島的人民已總動負，廣島在飛躍的進步中，以「戰勝國」自居的中國人民作何感想呢？</p>
<h3>「畫寢」與「畫寢」</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>「宰予畫寢，子曰：朽木，不可雕也。糞土之牆，不可枵也。於予與何誅！」——論語</p>
<p>宰予睡了一次畫覺，便挨着孔老夫子一頓臭駡！駡他是「朽木」；駡他是「糞土之牆」，最後還狠狠地來上一句：「於予與何誅」！未免太覺過分。日長人倦打打瞌睡，原屬人情生理之常，夫子何以如此大動肝火，溢出喜怒哀樂發而皆中節的範圍，眞是不可解的事？硬要像他老夫子栖栖皇皇，席不暇煖，正襟危坐，煞有介事，嚴　是夠嚴肅了，其奈身體吃勿消何？掉句現代術語，也就太不懂得生活的藝術啦！聖人們的矯情，倒不如高人逸士適性隨緣的舒泰寫意。陶淵明的「北窗高臥，凉風乍至，自謂是羲皇上人」。及「我醉欲眠君可去」。試間是何等高致！眞要令人五體投地的嚮往呢：筍子謂：「人性本惡，其善者僞也」。我亦要說：「人性本好逸惡勞，其硬裝緊張嚴肅者僞也」。我此說不是主張荒怠放逸，而是說要在嚴肅的時候嚴肅，休閒的時候休閒。亦即西洋人所謂工作的時候工作，休息的時候休息之意。比如宰予睡一次畫覺，身體得到休息，理來精神泡　，　起書來一定有勁些！孔老夫子却不懂得這道理，而要强迫實行「疲勞轟炸」式的　書法，不獨有背敎　原理，而且要大傷宰于自尊之心！元論從何種觀念上講，都是過了分的。</p>
<p>正因這樣，有一位朋友曾經告訴過我說：這句書的原文是有錯誤的。他說：宰予「畫寢」的「畫」字應該是「畫」字。以孔子聖之，他從不駡人，即不得已而有所訓斥，亦是恰如其分，不偏不倚，不過火亦無不及的，何至有此不倫不類的駡語？至於「畫寢」應作何解釋？却可按文索義，大約宰予愛好藝術，又有幾分藝術天才，和一腔濃厚的興趣！他想在寢室裏的牆頭裝點一下，不知用的是那種工具，在牆壁上圖畫起來，只因宰予的宿舍並不富　堂皇！牆壁梁柱亦不過是因陋就簡，粗具規模，與顏淵的陋巷相去不遠。所以孔子看着這塲面，毫無圖畫裝飾的必要。而好勝的宰予，偏要在上面大畫特畫，所以夫子看見了便敎訓他說：朽壞的木頭是不好雕琢的，糞土的牆上是不堪圖飾的。換句話說，他老夫子的意思就是茅屋上用不着裝綉球，就是凡事要得其宜如其分。這樣的解釋恐怕不免有些臆度牽强和附會吧？但請恕我無法加以考證，暫且姑妄言之。不過我倒是有幾分同意「畫」字應該爲「畫」字的說法的。因爲這樣正可替聖人們開脫辯護，並且是用以完成聖人們整個人格的唯一妙法。不然，我們對孔老夫子，總不免要引起懷疑，打些折扣。即以此午睡一事而論，千載之下，我們是還要替宰予抱不平，向他老夫子提出抗議，請他予以更正的。</p>
<h3>人的感情</h3>
<p>— 袁聖</p>
<p>熱水瓶中總有一股水蒸汽向上　的力，塞子蓋得不緊，就那麼「嘆」的一下跳了出來，洩去一部份氣，鬆了一點力；蓋得過緊的話，說不定整個的瓶子都會被炸掉；不加上塞一十，熱氣都跑光，變成了冷水，便不成其爲熱水瓶了。</p>
<p>而整個的人也就像　熱水瓶，七情—喜，怒，哀，懼，愛，惡，欲—便是一股有力的氣，使人活潑，有生氣，各人的壓制力就好比是塞子。壓制力弱一些，發洩出來點情感，倒是無所謂的；壓制力過强，情感旣不能洩出，只好內向攻心，於是這個身體便成問題了；不加壓制力則情感過份發洩，必受到意外的打擊，如疾病和失望等，弄到後來，萬念如灰，沒有什麽情感，成為凉血動物，當然稱不得人了。</p>
<p>所以熱水瓶也能給我們敎訓。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的婚姻觀</p>
<p>美國男女對於婚姻看得極平淡，感情好時立刻可以結婚，感情消失時立刻可以離婚，女子都有自立的本領，離婚不要瞻養金，世界一切都時時刻刻在變化，男女結合不能保其不變，想透闢了，自然把結婚離婚看得無足輕重，那末社會也就不致於發生許多家庭慘劇，諸如討姨太太遺棄髮妻等等。反之，美國絕對不會有這種演出，夫妻一言不合，往法院聲請離異，明天各找各的愛人去了。在我們看來，好像拆開了一個家庭，而實際則解決了一個同床各夢的悽慘家庭，組成了一個美滿恩愛的家庭，對於社會是有百利而無一弊的。美國女子把個人自由看得很重，如果丈夫拔了她一根毫毛，她立刻提出訴訟，非這樣不能打倒雄閥的統治，同樣一個人，爲什麽女子要被男子屈服呢？美國女子把個人自由放在婚姻之前，如果沒有自由，實可放棄丈夫，另找出路，她又不完全靠丈夫生活，爲什麽要受他的管束。美國小姐把結一次婚，看做搬一次家，甚至比搬一次家更便宜，早晨結婚，傍晚離婚的不知凡幾，此種辦法，固不足為訓，但「從一而終」「一女不事二夫」的舊觀念不知葬送多少好女子的終身幸福。世界人類總有一天要脫離婚姻的梏桎，把媒婆拋　在角落裏，那時三姑六婆失業了，美團給婚也沒有了生意，市長可以少了一件證婚工作，把精神用到改革市政上去，禮服商不再能加新婚夫婦剝削一筆租錢，還可省下幾十萬元一對的結婚證書，什麼給婚照片，一拍就是幾百萬元，也是無爲浪費，美國小姐在這種種方面化的錢，比中國新娘少得多了。</p>

<h3>宣布遜位的荷蘭女皇</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>在海牙的洛丁德街上，時常有一個矮胖的老婦人，戴着一頂敝舊的帽子，騎着脚踏車在人羣中走。她到了皇宮，踏進大門，下車時一個衛士跑來扶持她，她揮揮手，自己把脚路車放在車架上。</p>
<p>她就是現代歐洲僅在幾個君主國家中，在寶座上坐得最長久的一人，成廉明娜•海倫，寶琳。瑪麗——「荷蘭的維多利亞」。</p>
<p>威廉女皇今年六十七歲了，主持荷蘭國政已有四十九年，據路透社的電訊，她預備遜位給她的女兒裘麗安娜公主，等待國會兩院聯合會議通過後，便由裘麗公主接位。女皇遜位的動機，實在在十年以前，早就提出。但是那時正在歐陸風雲緊急之秋，希特勒領導下的納粹軍隊，企圖併呑荷蘭。荷蘭雖然弱小，但畢竟不甘屈服，因此，這倔强的老婦人又支撐了十年之久。</p>
<p>女皇倔强的性格，在小時候已經養成。歷史上有着這麽一個著名的傳說：</p>
<p>當荷蘭前王威廉第三崩殂後，女皇以沖齡踐祚，只是一個年甫十齡的女孩子（後來在十八歲時舉行加冕。）當時由母后攝政，約束女皇極嚴。但是這女孩子終於在一天受了母親過度的督責後，大發脾氣了：「我要站在皇宮的露台上，向國人宜佈，你是怎樣的虐待我！」使她母親不得不軟化。這軼事曾經傳遍荷蘭。</p>
<p>一九一八年，德皇威廉戰敗逃入荷蘭，女皇予以收容，曾遭到各方不滿。英相勞合喬治要求引渡德皇到倫敦受審，她只是冷冰冰的冋答：『你們太幼稚了！』使英廷大爲震動。</p>
<p>還有一個例子：十年以前，她的女兒裘麗安娜——就是不久的荷闌新女皇，與德國貝拉特親王結婚時，她禁止在禮堂中縣掛　字旗，希特勒知道了大發雷霆。她寫信給那位獨裁者說：「這是我女兒和她的愛人結婚，可不是荷蘭和德國結婚。」</p>
<p>她有着堅强的固執的意志，使荷蘭在一個婦人的統治下，一切都顯得很安謚良好。第二次歐戰逼她倉惶逃出海牙皇宮，納粹黨徒追緝她，謀刺她，在到英國去的輪船上，她和裘麗公主幾乎被德軍的水雷所炸死。然而她終於到達了了倫敦，組織了流亡政府。</p>
<p>女皇在二十歲時與德國麥倫堡親王亨利結婚。這位亨利親王，結婚後備受拘束，只掛了一個「荷蘭紅十字會會長」的空銜頭，國會不肯授以「荷蘭親王」的頭銜，或是批準他一點歲俸。他也明知反抗無益，只得以行獵旅行自遺。第一次大戰時，因爲他是德國人，還被女皇命令警察嚴密監視。這位倒霉的丈夫，現在不知怎麼樣了。</p>
<p>裘麗安娜公主在一九〇九年誕生。女皇鑒於自己在幼年時備受桎梏，特准予以新敎育，敎她到公立學校去讀書，與其他學生同樣待遇。公主生性總頴，愛好音樂及運動。在巴黎和貝拉特認識，他比裘麗小兩歲，很窮，在巴黎德國顏料公司任職，但立刻他倆戀愛了，一九三七年一月七日宣告結婚。</p>
<p>威廉女皇，在結婚日發表廣播稱：「貝拉特雖然只有二十五歲，但他實在是一個很努力的工作者。」婚後，貝拉特宣布與德國國社黨絕緣，在精神與靈魂上他算是一個荷蘭人。</p>
<p>當公主與貝拉特在法國里維拉作蜜月旅行時，一個星期日的晚宴上喝了鷄尾酒，（這在女皇的規律上是絕對禁止的。）荷蘭報紙的記者把這事在報上披露出來，女皇大為震怒，立刻召他們回國，禁閉在Soestdyk宮內。幾個月後，公主懷有身孕，翌年一月生了一個女孩子。——假使荷蘭的君主政體不變，很可能地，這女孩將是二十年後荷蘭的第三個女皇。</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Leads Eight European Nations to Form New Communist International, Issues Joint Declaration Against the United States, Clear Division Between Two Major World Camps</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here on the 5th that the communist parties of nine European nations have established a common party program, refusing to compromise with American "imperialism," and have established a headquarters in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, to act in unison. Earlier, sources in Paris said that the communist parties of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy held a meeting in Poland at the end of September to determine the basic program, the content of which is now being published here. Pravda and various European communist newspapers stated: the leaders of the nine communist parties gathered in a certain location in Poland last month, with the Soviet Union sending Politburo members Zhdanov and Malenkov to attend. Their reports are considered an important part of today's one-thousand-word declaration. Zhdanov was one of the signatories to the resolution to dissolve the Third International, announced on May 15, 1943.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Pravda today published a piece of news of great significance to the international situation: representatives of the communist parties of Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, France, and Italy held a meeting in Poland at the end of September and resolved to establish an information bureau with its headquarters in Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia). The purpose of establishing the information bureau is to exchange experiences and decide on coordinated actions. It will be organized by two representatives from the central committees of each national party who attended the aforementioned meeting, and they will be appointed by the central committees. The bureau will publish a monthly magazine in Russian and French, and may also issue a weekly magazine in the future. Zhdanov, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reported on the international situation at the meeting. After hearing the report, a declaration was issued stating: The world is now divided into two major camps. The Soviet Union is currently fighting for peace and democracy, while the United States is attempting to control the world. The declaration strongly criticized Truman, Marshall, and the socialist parties of Britain and France, calling the right-wing elements of the socialist parties traitors. It also stated: American imperialism is attempting to enslave Europe, China, Indonesia, and South America, and to turn the big capitalists of Germany and Japan into its pawns. In addition to criticizing British Prime Minister Attlee, French Socialist Party leader Blum, French Prime Minister Ramadier, President of the Italian Constituent Assembly Saragat, Austrian Chancellor Renner (Social Democratic Party), etc., the declaration also pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is enthusiastically pursuing British imperialism. The declaration finally encouraged the communist parties of all countries to strive for national independence and democracy, and to resist imperialist plans in politics, economics, and ideology. The representatives attending the aforementioned meeting were all important figures in the communist parties of their respective countries, such as Zhdanov of the Soviet Union and Minc of Poland (the country's Minister of Industry).</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today refused to formally comment on Moscow's announcement of the re-establishment of the Communist International, but other officials privately admitted to being deeply concerned, fearing that this move foreshadows the Soviet Union intensifying its aid to the Chinese Communists. It is said that few Chinese people believe that the Communist International has indeed been dissolved. Moscow's announcement makes the Soviet Union's plans even more obvious. Chinese officials will closely monitor the future development of the situation. (Reactions from the United States, Britain, and France can be found in the left corner of page three.)</p>
<h3>Shandong Recovers Weihaiwei; Gui Yongqing Commands Naval Landing, Armor Mountain Area Sweeping Campaign Begins</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Qingdao, 6th] The navy, aboard ships such as "Taikang," "Yongning," and "Emei," landed at Weihaiwei on the morning of the 5th, personally commanded by Gui Yongqing. The remnants of the bandits fled to the southeast, and order in the urban area has now been restored. The important port of the Communist bandits in Shandong has now been completely recovered, and they are continuing to advance towards Wendeng and Rongcheng. The sweeping campaign in the Armor Mountain area has begun, with the air force conducting reconnaissance flights, and ground troops have penetrated deep into the mountainous area.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The battle to encircle and annihilate the fleeing remnants of the bandits by land and air forces on the border of the four counties of Gaomi, Pingdu, Changi, and Weixian has become even more intense today. More than half of the remaining 20,000 bandits have been killed or wounded. Our reinforcements have arrived from all directions, completing a major encirclement. With the assistance of a large air force, the remnants will be completely annihilated. The Qingwei Highway has just been repaired, but due to the fleeing bandits, the Dahe Bridge and Wulonghe Bridge have been destroyed again. The personnel supervising the repair of the Weihe Bridge have retreated from Jingzi Mountain to Fangzi, and the Qingwei transportation has been interrupted again.</p>
<h3>Coal, Finance, Food: Yantai Faces Three Difficulties, Authorities Seek Solutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] The three major difficulties facing the military and civilians in Yantai are being addressed by the military and political authorities here. Regarding coal, a portion will be temporarily prepared in the city. Regarding finance, according to Director Yu Jimin of the Shandong Administrative Office, an agreement has been reached with the Central Farmers Bank and the Central Bank to quickly expand the business of the two banks in Yantai, and to collect a portion of banknotes from Qingdao and transport them to Yantai. Regarding food, the military authorities here have ordered the National Army in Fushan, Laiyang, and other places to search for Communist bandits' hidden food in the mountains and send it to Yantai.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch from Yantai] This morning, citizens stood at the docks, welcoming the first repatriation ship, "Zhongtai," from Qingdao. Repatriated staff from the post office, telecommunications bureau, city party headquarters, youth corps, and municipal government, totaling more than 500 people, disembarked amidst enthusiastic cheers from the public. The "Zhongtai" carried more than 4,000 tons of cargo, bringing a large number of public goods and food. The post and telecommunications bureau is scheduled to start work on the 7th, and citizens eagerly await the arrival of banks in Yantai to revive the city's finances.</p>
<h3>National Army Reinforcements Arrive by Land and Water, Situation in Northern Jiangsu Stabilizes</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] The situation in northern Jiangsu is nearing a resolution. The Communist forces that invaded Yancheng, Chefu, and the Xinghua County area will soon face inevitable defeat under the National Army's active strategy. Daolu in Xinghua was recovered in one day, and the situation in Xinghua has indeed stabilized. Traffic between Gaoyou, Xinghua, Taixian, and Dongtai is as usual. Powerful National Army corps from a certain unit's two divisions, rushing to support northern Jiangsu, arrived in Xinghua and Dongtai yesterday and today by land and water. As a result, the people who evacuated from Dongtai and Xinghua counties a few days ago have returned to their villages.</p>
<h3>British Delegation to China Arrives in Nanjing Tomorrow, US Military Survey Team Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] According to diplomatic sources, the British delegation to China encountered a hurricane en route from Bangkok to Hong Kong on the 6th and returned to Bangkok. It is now reported that the delegation plans to fly from Bangkok to Hong Kong again on the 7th and arrive in Nanjing on the 8th. Their itinerary in Nanjing will therefore be changed, and the protocol department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will renegotiate with the relevant agencies. (Hurricane news on the sixth column of page two)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] A fifteen-member U.S. Congressional Global Military Survey Team arrived in Beiping this afternoon from Seoul. In the afternoon, they visited military and political authorities in Beiping and discussed with the U.S. Consul in Beiping the itinerary for inspecting U.S. Army and Navy forces in China. They decided to fly to Qingdao on the 8th for a meeting with the U.S. Navy Advisory Group, fly to Nanjing on the 10th, and plan to meet with Chairman Chiang. On the 11th, they will fly to Shanghai and then travel to Okinawa, the Philippines, Myanmar, India, Turkey, North Africa, and Europe. The team includes six congressmen: Cole, Herbert, Scrivner, Classon, Reece, and Norblad, as well as nine staff members, including two financial experts, five army officers, and one navy officer. In addition, a staff member from the U.S. Embassy in China will guide the inspection.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Herbert, a Democratic congressman on the U.S. Military Survey Team, stated that their main inspection sites in China are Qingdao and Shanghai, where they will inspect U.S. military equipment and the work of the military advisory group. Their visit to Beiping is purely for sightseeing.</p>

<h3>Improving the Livelihood of Civil Servants: Original Proposal Reviewed and Four Measures Decided, to be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan Plenary Session Today for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The proposal to improve the livelihood of civil servants and teachers was reviewed again by the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 6th. Chairman Liu Tong presided over the meeting, and more than ten people including Liu Butong, Liu Zhiping, and Cheng Yuanzhen attended. After two hours of heated discussion, it was resolved to rename the "Civil Servants and Teachers' Life Loan Project" to "Civil Servants and Teachers' Livelihood Improvement Project," and the following decisions were made:</p>
<p>1.  Starting from September, the minimum standard of living for civil servants and teachers should be based on the salary earned before the war, at 30 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index. Salaries exceeding this amount will be paid at one-tenth of the cost of living index. The calculation formula is as follows: 2.  Maintain the current method of purchasing physical goods.</p>
<p>2.  Provide dormitories for civil servants and teachers. a. Request the government to continue building new civil servant and teacher villages. b. Request the government to allocate enemy and puppet properties to civil servants and teachers as dormitories.</p>
<p>3.  Civil servants and their direct relatives receive free medical care when they are sick, and their children are exempt from tuition fees when they study in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Three supplementary resolutions: Stop private construction loans, and loans that have been issued should be recovered immediately. For special circumstances, interest should be calculated at the private interest rate of ordinary banks. The treatment of civil servants and teachers should be equal. The Housing Leasing Regulations should be revised as soon as possible. After this proposal is decided, it will be submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 7th.</p>

<h3>Control Yuan Continues Investigation of Overseas Foreign Exchange Usage, Song Ziwen Expresses Opinions on Control Yuan Report</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] According to reliable sources, although the domestic part of the investigation into the use of foreign exchange has been completed, the most important data in the United States remains to be collected. After all, the use of the US$500 million that the United States loaned to us in the past has not yet been fully clarified, and there are some doubts about it. For this reason, the Control Yuan has asked the Ministry of Finance to instruct the agencies in the United States to provide the Control Yuan with information on the use and quantity of materials supplied for loans in the United States, so as to conduct further investigations. The entire work will be difficult to complete in the short term. It is also heard that this investigation is not related to the deposits of Chinese people in the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] After the Control Yuan published the "Investigation Report on the Use of Foreign Exchange and the Business Conditions of Various Companies," which was published in various newspapers, Guangdong Chairman (former Premier) Song Ziwen made a statement on this matter. (Continued on the first column of page two)</p>
<h3>Du Zhenyuan Visits Song Ziwen, Discusses Building a Branch Line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Transport Coal from Gouyadong to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau, stated that he and Chairman Song discussed the security of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the construction of a branch line from Pingshi to Gouyadong. Gouyadong is a coal-producing area in northern Guangdong. There are currently more than 30 million tons of unmined coal in the area that no one is mining and transporting. Therefore, it is planned to build a branch line from there to connect to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway so that coal can be continuously transported to Guangzhou. At that time, the coal shortage in Guangdong Province can be solved. The line is 35 kilometers long and requires 50 billion yuan. He met with Chairman Song at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th to prepare to apply to the Executive Yuan for funds for construction and to mobilize investment from all parties for development. He also stated that Chairman Song paid great attention to the Huangpu Port. The branch line from Guangzhou to Huangpu has been completely completed. He personally inspected the road on the 4th. Although the project is simple, it is barely usable.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Summons Subordinates</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Song Ziwen summoned the heads of various units under the provincial government in the past few days and gave instructions on security, finance, finance, and economic construction. Mr. Song has great hopes for the Industrial Division and is determined to actively develop it. It is heard that the most large-scale textile factory and the Shunde Sugar Factory will first be allowed to be reorganized and expanded.</p>
<h3>Members of the Engineers Association Visit Industrial Construction</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Members attending the annual meeting of the Engineers Association set off in two groups on the morning of the 6th to visit industrial construction near the capital. More than 300 people went to visit the Yongli Chemical Plant and returned to Nanjing in the afternoon. The factory was built in February of the 26th year and is the only large-scale chemical factory in Asia. The maximum daily output of ammonium sulfate (fertilizer) can reach 150 tons, and sulfuric acid can reach 500 tons. However, it was occupied by the enemy during the war, and it was greatly damaged. Currently, it can only produce 100 tons of ammonium sulfate and 80 tons of sulfuric acid per day. Expansion is currently being sought, and some of the machines purchased from the United States have been shipped. Two factories are planned to be set up to double the existing production. The reason for the current reduction in output is the difficulty in obtaining coal sources. The large scale of the factory has made its neighboring Liuhe County famous as a chemical city.</p>
<h3>Minority Parties Participate in General Election, Negotiations to be Held Again Within the Week</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] According to sources close to Zhang Junli, Zhang's visit to Nanjing to negotiate the general election issue did not reach an agreement. Before leaving, he agreed with Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng to continue negotiations within this week. Whether it will be in Nanjing or Shanghai has not been decided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] An official from the Central Committee of the Kuomintang told visiting reporters that "the reason why the negotiations between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Kuomintang on participating in the general election failed to reach an agreement is the technical problem of how to enable a considerable number of minority parties to be elected. After all, voters in various places have the freedom to vote, and even candidates nominated by the Kuomintang cannot guarantee that they will be elected. The Kuomintang people deeply hope to cooperate closely with minority parties in the general election, but it is slightly difficult to achieve a situation where each party has a considerable number of people elected in terms of technology, so it remains to be studied further. As for how to resolve the issue of minority parties recommending party members to participate in popularly elected local public opinion institutions, it also needs to be discussed further, but there is no difficulty in participating in local temporary councils."</p>

<h3>Traffic Blockade in City and Suburbs, Changchun City Defense Further Consolidated, National Army in Shenyang Holds Defense Exercise</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changchun, 6th] The bandit Independent Fourth Division, which had fled from Wanbaoshan to Xiaolong, is close to the suburbs of Changchun, but no attempt to attack Changchun has been found. Mengjiatun in southern Changchun was once again occupied by bandits last night. Bandits on horseback have now been found on the south, west, and north sides of Changchun, totaling nearly 20,000. However, after the National Army announced the blockade of traffic between the city and the suburbs starting from the 5th, public order in the city became more consolidated. However, Songjia Jiazi in the north of the city was harassed by bandits yesterday, and the police station arrested more than ten disguised bandits in the area. According to National Army generals in charge of the city defense, Changchun is now a "steel Changchun," and the small bandits are not to be feared. The Sixth Column of bandits, which attacked Danantun and Gongzhuling from Yitong, has now been determined by the military to have crossed the Siping area via Helusu on the east side of the China Changchun Railway and is participating in the battle south of Siping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The city of Changchun has not been alarmed by the proximity of the bandits to the suburbs in recent days. Shops and stalls in the city are operating as usual, and cinemas and entertainment venues are as prosperous as usual. Public order in the city is as usual. The city defense fortifications around the city, which 600,000 citizens have built by hand for several months, meander through the suburbs, making them seem to live in solid bunkers. The military authorities in Changchun announced the blockade of traffic between the city and the suburbs starting yesterday and conducted a household census all night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The magnificent pace of Changchun's men, women, and children concentrating their efforts to defend Changchun is about to enter its climax. The military and political authorities in Changchun are now launching all men and women in the city to organize a wartime work corps, whose detachments will be scattered in various defense areas to undertake various logistical tasks. Civil servants and students from various agencies and schools in Changchun will be the basic members of the corps.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] The garrison troops held a defense exercise this afternoon, with Chu Xichun as the commander-in-chief. Streets and alleys were equipped with well-equipped National Army troops, ordered to deploy defenses as if facing a formidable enemy. According to the person in charge of the Defense Headquarters, the significance of the exercise lies in guarding against the infiltration of small groups of Communist bandits and the activities of Communist bandits' latent elements.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] At the Hunhe Grand Iron Bridge in the south of Shenyang on the night of the 5th, a team of more than 70 people suddenly arrived. Four soldiers went forward and claimed to be there to change defenses. The defending army replied that they had not received orders and waved them away. Not long after, the other party fired at the iron bridge, but was repelled by the defending army. The bandits' trick failed. (News about price controls in Panjin on the fourth column of page two)</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Fierce fighting continues in the Gaoling area along the Beining Railway outside the Guan. The National Army is unusually strong, and the Pingjin Army inside the Guan is now unimpeded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] The situation in western Liaoning is calm. A unit of the Fifth Division of the Seventh Column of bandits attacked Gaotai Mountain, Liusha River, and other places northeast of Xinmin on the morning of the 5th. After a fierce attack by the National Army, almost the entire army was wiped out and has now fled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The important town of Wulajie in northern Jilin is still firmly defended by the National Army. The two sides are facing each other across the Songhua River in Wulajie. There was no fighting in eastern Jilin yesterday.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Draft Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>Regarding the draft Commercial Registration Law, our newspaper expressed initial opinions in an article on the 1st of this month, but felt the need for further elaboration. Therefore, we now present the following additional arguments:</p>
<p>Eliminate Redundant Procedures: Businesses that have already completed company registration should, as a rule, not be required to undergo commercial registration again. This is because the company name has already been determined during the registration process, and the issue of trade name rights does not arise, so there is no need for further protection. Following this logic, whenever a business's trade name rights are already protected by other regulations, requiring further commercial registration is redundant. Therefore, for businesses such as grain merchants and pawnshops that have already obtained official permits, the law should allow for exceptions. This would save merchants from going through repetitive procedures and would not compromise the government's administrative oversight.</p>
<p>Establish More Registration Agencies: Current regulations stipulate that the competent authority for commercial registration is the county government at the county level and the social affairs bureau in municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. This poses no major obstacle in cities because businesses are relatively concentrated, distances are limited, and transportation is readily available. Even if the procedures require multiple trips, it is still manageable. However, the situation in counties is very different. Outside the urban areas, the rural markets and villages can be tens or even hundreds of miles away. If the current system requires all businesses to apply directly to the county government, the costs of food, lodging, and transportation will inevitably exceed the registration fees, placing an undue burden on merchants. To alleviate this difficulty, it should be stipulated that county governments may delegate the handling or acceptance of applications to local district offices, thereby easing the burden on businesses.</p>
<p>Provide Assistance with Registration Procedures: All registration procedures, including required documents and fees, may appear simple. However, many ordinary merchants and citizens are unfamiliar with laws and regulations and struggle with filling out forms, leaving them feeling helpless. Even in Shanghai, a city known for its progressive atmosphere and higher levels of business acumen, many businesses still have to pay experts to handle the application process. How much more difficult is it in inland cities? The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing this situation, has introduced rules for public associations to assist with the registration process, precisely to ease the burden on merchants and citizens. Given the scarcity of experts and greater barriers in inland areas, clear guidelines should be established, allowing designated personnel from the competent authorities to provide one-on-one guidance and assistance with filling out forms for those who are unable to do so, charging reasonable fees, to avoid unnecessary delays and minimize the substantial mental and material losses suffered by merchants.</p>
<p>Maintain Voluntary Registration: The above suggestions are all aimed at facilitating commercial activity. However, if the draft law is adopted, making commercial registration mandatory and enforcing strict deadlines with penalties for non-compliance, the policy of protecting businesses' trade name rights will inevitably deviate from its intended purpose and become an oppressive measure. As mentioned previously, mandatory registration does not enhance government administration. Some argue that without mandatory registration, the government cannot gain a comprehensive overview of commercial activity, thus hindering its ability to formulate appropriate policies to address deficiencies. In other words, those who advocate for mandatory registration aim to obtain commercial data and statistics for policy-making, which is understandable. However, it should be recognized that administrative surveys and statistics should be conducted by the government itself and should not burden the public, forcing all merchants to expend resources and face penalties under the guise of commercial registration to satisfy the desire for secondary benefits. For example, last year, certain agencies and organizations in this city conducted a survey on labor conditions by distributing forms, collecting data, and assigning personnel to provide guidance. The results were satisfactory because they were based on factual information and general knowledge. We believe that this is a good practice that should be emulated when conducting commercial surveys.</p>
<p>Moreover, merchants tend to be lazy and seek convenience, and even with strict enforcement of mandatory registration, the outcome may not be entirely satisfactory. Why do we say this? Currently, membership in trade associations is legally mandatory, and penalties are in place for non-compliance, yet many businesses still do not join. Similarly, workers are legally required to join labor unions, but many still do not. Furthermore, current commercial registration, based on ministerial orders, is already mandatory. In Shanghai, when it was first introduced, specific areas were designated, and deadlines were set for completion. The local regulations were even stricter than the draft law. However, after nearly two years of urging and repeated extensions, it is said that only about 60,000 businesses have registered so far. In inland counties, not only are merchants indifferent, but the county governments responsible for this task are often too busy to attend to it. Therefore, relying on commercial registration to obtain comprehensive commercial data and statistics may be unrealistic.</p>
<p>Add Restrictive Clauses: It is not legal coercion but the allure of benefits that drives registration. In Shanghai, for example, the only industries with high registration rates are those with access to goods allocation. It is said that the total number of grain merchants in this city exceeds 4,000. Concerned about the excessive number, some relevant authorities wish to impose restrictions. However, given the available resources, what legal grounds are there to reject registrations? Furthermore, due to the allocation of goods through several trade associations, the number of new members has surged, leading to a situation where resources are spread thin, and the interests of existing members are diluted. The newcomers have even taken over the dominant positions, disrupting the original order. These members have appealed to the authorities to impose restrictions. However, under the current laws, what legal means are available to impose such restrictions?</p>
<p>As we all know, Shanghai is home to unscrupulous businesses that exist in name only, specializing in speculation and fraud. However, as long as they meet the requirements for registration, there is no way to refuse their application. Moreover, according to Article 20 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Enterprises During Extraordinary Periods, restrictions can be imposed on the manufacturing of luxury goods or other non-essential enterprises. However, the Commercial Registration Law does not contain any such provisions. Most surprisingly, gambling is explicitly prohibited, but the registration law does not explicitly prohibit the manufacturing and sale of gambling paraphernalia. Examples of this kind are numerous. We believe that the conditions for restricting registration, as stipulated in Article 6 of the Implementing Rules, namely, "not contrary to public order" and "good customs," are insufficient and require supplementation.</p>
<p>Chapter VII of the draft law stipulates: "Businesses that have not been registered before the implementation of this law shall, within one year after the implementation of this law, apply for establishment registration in accordance with the provisions of this law." This deadline is also too short. Given that it has taken Shanghai two years to complete registration, and even with lenient estimates, only about two-thirds of businesses have registered, it is conceivable that other counties and cities that have not yet initiated the process or have vast jurisdictions will need more time. It is important to recognize that once this deadline is written into the law, it becomes a rigid requirement. If the registration is not completed by the deadline, not only will all unregistered businesses be considered illegal, but the competent authorities in each city and county will also be held accountable for failing to implement the law effectively. Therefore, it is best not to include the registration deadline in the law but to allow local administrative authorities to adjust it based on their specific circumstances.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Mr. Song stated: "The provisional measures for the administration of foreign exchange and import-export trade have all been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council for implementation. As President of the Executive Yuan, I am responsible for enforcing the law. All foreign exchange converted during my tenure, with my approval, has been vetted to ensure compliance with the administrative measures before being approved for conversion. There has absolutely been no instance of non-compliance. After the government convened the Political Consultative Conference in February of the 35th year of the Republic, the general public believed that the country could finally be stabilized. Therefore, the government devoted its full efforts to stabilizing prices and finance so that the people, who had suffered from prolonged warfare, could find some respite. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party violated the agreement and resumed hostilities. Transportation facilities were largely destroyed, production capacity was reduced, and military expenditures increased, leading to a sharp increase in currency issuance. These developments cannot be solely attributed to my responsibility. The public will judge fairly, and there is no need for me to elaborate. As for the foreign exchange converted by the Fuzhong, Yangzi, and China Construction Bank companies, the Ministry of Finance has conducted detailed investigations and published the figures. It accounts for only 0.5% of the total foreign exchange converted, which is one-half of one percent. When the Associated Press of America published news claiming that these three companies monopolized foreign exchange, thus monopolizing import-export trade, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement clarifying the situation, refuting the Associated Press's report as completely baseless and denying any possibility of monopolizing import-export trade. I have never inquired about the affairs of Fuzhong and Yangzi companies. As for the China Construction Bank, I resigned from my position as director when I became President of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, if there were any irregularities in the operations of the company, the responsible persons of the company should be held accountable, and I bear no responsibility. I have not yet seen the full text released by the Control Yuan. I am providing these comments based on what I have read in the newspapers."</p>
<h3>Opening Up Local Political Power</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party are taking a relatively proactive stance toward opening up local political power. The nominees of the Democratic Socialist Party for the three provincial committees have been finalized as Zhang Zhongxuan (Hubei), Tan Kaiyun (Anhui), and Zhong Jiemin (Guangdong). Li Yunian, a member of the China Youth Party, has announced the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Committee. After the National Congress, Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and Liu Dongyan were designated as representatives to visit Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng separately to discuss the opening up of local political organs and the protection of the party members' activities in various regions. Zhang and Wu stated that "opening up local political power is the government's established policy and will be implemented gradually. Orders have already been issued to local authorities to adopt a friendly attitude toward the activities of the China Youth Party." Furthermore, according to party members, four party members were arrested and killed while campaigning in Luzhou and Peng'an, Sichuan Province. In addition to pursuing legal solutions locally, the five representatives have also reported the case to the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Report, 6th] Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party lodged a protest with the government on the 4th regarding the detention of party members. The protest letter was delivered to Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Military and Official Discipline Supervisory Group Submits Suggestions to Improve the Handling of Enemy Property in the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Report, 6th] The Military and Official Discipline Supervisory Group, responding to accusations regarding the handling of enemy property by the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Enemy Property Management Bureau, conducted an investigation and discovered instances of corruption. They have prepared a set of recommendations and submitted them to the Control Yuan via telegram for transmittal to the Executive Yuan. The recommendations stated: "Real estate that should be returned is not returned, while real estate that should not be returned is returned. In terms of materials, collusion with unscrupulous merchants or purchases and auctions dominated by influential figures have occurred." The Bureau is scheduled to cease operations soon and transfer responsibilities to the China Trust Bureau. However, due to the urgency of the matter, the current staff still numbers over 400. Therefore, the China Trust Bureau will be understaffed after taking over. Establishing a separate organization would result in a top-heavy structure. Therefore, the recommendations suggest that after the Bureau ceases operations, the China Trust Bureau, representing the Executive Yuan, should jointly form a committee with local governments and public opinion organizations to avoid the abuses of power by a single entity. The committee should conduct a thorough investigation of the past work.</p>

<h3>Major Event in the Capital Tomorrow Morning: United Nations Flag Parade</h3>

<h3>Li Shutian Delivers Speech: The Major Port in the North Should Still Be in Qinghekou; Tanggu New Port Is Prone to Freezing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Li Shutian, Dean of the College of Engineering at Beiyang University, recently delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, discussing the Hai River, the Tanggu New Port, and the major port in the North. Mr. Li began by stating, "We should use a telescope, not a microscope, when looking at seaports." He continued, "Throughout history, the Yellow River has flowed into the sea through Tianjin, and the silt carried by the river has clogged the harbor, making it impossible to build a major port at Dagu. Comparing the major port in the North in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan with the Tanggu New Port, the major port in the North is only a few miles away from a 40-foot deep-water area, and the surrounding waters do not freeze in winter. The Tanggu New Port, on the other hand, lacks flowing river water and is prone to freezing. Therefore, the major port in the North should still be in Qinghekou." Mr. Li also discussed the functions of Tanggu New Port, stating, "The navigation channel in the Japanese-built new port plan is 200 meters wide and 6 meters deep, which is only sufficient for coastal vessels. The New Port Engineering Bureau plans to deepen the channel to 8 meters. Although this standard can be technically achieved, it will be difficult to maintain."</p>
<h3>Rao Invites Minister Gu to Attend the Asian Labor Conference in India</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The International Labor Office (ILO) will convene the Asian Labor Preparatory Conference in Delhi from October 27th to November. ILO Director-General Phelan has invited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in his capacity as the head of the labor administration department, to attend. Indian Ambassador to China Menon recently forwarded a letter from Indian Labor Minister Rao to Minister Gu, representing the Indian government, welcoming him to visit India as a guest to participate in the conference. They also stated that if he is unable to attend the entire conference due to official duties, he should at least attend some of the meetings to enhance the impact of the first-ever labor conference held in Asia due to his presence. It is said that Minister Gu is unable to accept the invitation due to his busy schedule and the approaching general election, as well as his important responsibilities related to vocational and women's organizations' election affairs. If arrangements can be made in the near future, he may be able to accept the invitation.</p>

<h3>Full Report of the Supervisory Yuan</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Since the government promulgated the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 17, 1946, and established the Provisional Import Management Committee to adjust the exchange rate to 3.350, in addition to individuals and other non-import foreign exchange needs that continued to be approved and settled by designated banks, applications for foreign exchange required for imported goods, where letters of credit had been opened by designated banks before November 17, and shipments had commenced to China before November 24 (November 20 for Hong Kong), except for items listed in the attached schedule which should be applied for at the secretariat of the Provisional Import Management Committee, all other imported goods should be applied for import permits from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. For orders placed after November 17, they should be sent to the various departments of the Provisional Management Committee for review according to the type of goods. That is, for goods listed in Schedule 1 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, applications should be submitted to the secretariat of the committee; for goods listed in Schedule 2, applications should be submitted to the Quota Allocation Department or the Import Management Department; for goods listed in Schedule 3A, applications should be submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Designated banks should not freely settle or sell foreign exchange applied for by importers without prior review and approval from the relevant competent authorities (however, designated banks may still approve and settle foreign exchange for goods listed in Schedule 1 and Schedule 3A if their value is less than US$2,000). As for the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for individuals and other non-import purposes (such as export insurance premiums and freight), the Central Bank stipulated in Notice No. 69 on December 16, 1946, that from that date onward, settlement and sale to designated banks must be approved by the Central Bank. As a result of this control, the quantity of imports gradually decreased, and instances of foreign exchange waste were rarely discovered.</p>
<p>In February of this year, a gold rush occurred, and prices soared. The black market exchange rate was 7,600 yuan on February 1, rose to 9,000 yuan on February 5, rose to 13,500 yuan on February 10, and rose to 14,000 yuan on February 14. Therefore, the government had no choice but to promulgate emergency economic measures to prohibit the free trading and use of gold and U.S. dollars, and at the same time adjusted the exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. At that time, exports were quite active in the short term, while imports became increasingly difficult. In recent months, the black market has revived, and the official price has become detached from the market price. Exporters also feel constrained. Overseas Chinese merchants evade imports in the Hong Kong area. The foreign exchange business of various designated banks has decreased sharply. Therefore, the government further adopted the method of changing the foreign exchange rate based on market conditions at any time on August 17, in addition to the fixed official price. For imported goods, from August 18, it was explicitly ordered that all those with self-provided foreign exchange should also temporarily suspend imports, in order to further tighten the use of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(C) Analysis of Foreign Exchange Usage Figures</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, there have been repeated changes in foreign exchange management institutions and usage policies, as mentioned above. Regarding the foreign exchange usage in each period, the following figures have been investigated:</p>
<p>The total amount of foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank and designated banks to general industry, commerce, and individuals for legitimate needs, excluding the US$64,200,845.95 sold from August 19, 1945, to March 3, 1946, as mentioned earlier, is calculated from March 4, 1946, to November 17 of the same year. During this eight-and-a-half-month period, according to the provisions of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, except for the various goods listed in Schedule B that should be prohibited from import, and the various items listed in Schedule A that must be applied to the customs for permission before import, all kinds of goods not listed in the two schedules can be freely imported, only needing to apply to the customs for tax payment according to the prescribed tariff, without any specific quantity restrictions, and the foreign exchange required to pay the price should also be supplied according to the requested quantity. During this period, the Central Bank and designated banks sold a total of US$381,522,461.13, £16,761,660, and HK$24,325,589.88. From November 17, 1946, when the government revised the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, from November 18 of the same month to February 15, 1947, according to Schedule 1 of the revised measures, US$2,340,333.20, £77,177, and HK$81,720.83 were sold; according to Schedule 2, US$10,559,460.80, £349,698, and HK$255,375.00 were sold; according to Schedule 3A, US$7,212,246.80, £447,029, and HK$3,212,083.42 were sold. In total, from March 4, 1946, to February 15, 1947, US$401,663,501.93, £17,635,564, and HK$27,874,769.13 were sold. Among them, the amount sold from November 18, 1946, to February 15, 1947, was US$20,111,040.80, £873,904, and HK$3,549,179.25, accounting for only 5% of the total amount. In these two periods, in terms of the total amount, the quantity of foreign exchange used decreased significantly from November 18, 1946, to February 15, 1947, due to the promulgation of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. In terms of the users, the Executive Yuan approved the settlement and sale of a total of US$20,434,085.66 to government agencies, and approved the import of goods worth approximately US$480 million, and approved applications from individuals and industries and businesses worth approximately US$23 million. From February 16 to August 30 of this year, the designated banks sold a total of US$4,981,878.52, £635,965, and HK$155,998.00 according to Schedule 1; US$100,655,688.00, £4,018,798, and HK$4,293,718.00 according to Schedule 2; and US$7,495,892.00, £945,582, and HK$2,099,633.00 according to Schedule 3. The total is approximately US$150 million (see Attachments 5 and 6 for details).</p>
<p>In terms of the content of imported goods, the largest quantity was cotton, with a total import value of US$120,794,178.00, £1,894,820, HK$176,737.00, and Indian Rupees 65,056,056 from March 4 of last year to August 30 of this year, totaling about US$180 million. The second largest was liquid fuel, worth approximately US$125 million, followed by tobacco leaves and cigarettes worth approximately US$45 million, chemical drugs worth approximately US$78.5 million, various foods worth approximately US$27.5 million, hardware and machinery worth approximately US$80 million, and transportation equipment (including automobiles) worth approximately US$26 million (see Attachment 5 for details). From this, it can be seen that a large amount of foreign exchange in the past year or so has been used more for consumer goods and less for construction purposes.</p>
<p>(D) The Central Trust Bureau, Materials Supply Bureau, and World Trade Corporation's Foreign Exchange Usage for Ordering Materials</p>
<p>Central Trust Bureau: It is found that the bureau's handling of overseas material orders is coordinated by the purchasing department, and the materials handled can be divided into three categories. The first category is materials imported from abroad on behalf of the government, including rice, flour, mobile housing, newsprint, pulp, coal, cotton, and automobiles from 1945 to the end of August this year (see Attachment 7). Among them, the automobile item was ordered under the order of the Executive Yuan (see the next section). The second category is materials ordered from abroad on behalf of various agencies, totaling 179 cases from September 1945 to the end of August this year, including 62 cases for gasoline, motor oil, and aviation oil ordered by the Liquid Fuel Management Committee, the Aviation Committee, the Ministry of Military Administration, the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and the Air Force Headquarters, most of which were approved for foreign exchange settlement by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance. In addition, there are various items such as paper, machinery, medicines, chemicals, books, instruments, and burlap bags, with no extravagant items (see Attachment 8 for details). The third category is materials purchased abroad by the Central Trust Bureau itself, totaling 14 cases from September 1945 to the end of August this year. Among them, newsprint, burlap bags, tinplate, oats, and yellow Vaseline are necessary items for self-use or distribution. In addition, 213 tons of Zunlin paper cost US$91,950.00, 5,210,403 board feet of American pine cost US$515,441.42, and seven Chevrolet cars cost US$17,000.00. Because the bureau has the convenience of owning foreign exchange, it is inevitable that it is used for non-urgent needs (see Attachment 9 for details).</p>
<p>Materials Supply Bureau: The main purpose of establishing the Materials Supply Bureau is to supplement the government's budget balance of revenue and expenditure, use materials to absorb legal currency in exchange for foreign exchange, and at the same time concentrate and properly distribute the remaining materials from various parties after the Anti-Japanese War to avoid waste. According to the bureau's report, from its establishment to the end of August this year, the cases handled include Lend-Lease reception materials, World Trade Corporation materials, Canadian loan materials, Export Bank materials, Lend-Lease surplus materials, American surplus materials, British credit loan materials, receiving materials from the Chongqing Equipment General Depot of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, World Trade Corporation's stored materials in India, British credit loan stored materials in India, and other stored materials in India, totaling US$174,801,116.32, £345,075, and National Currency 5,860,846,863.00 (see Attachment 10 for details). The content of these materials includes military supplies, railway equipment, materials, machine parts, ordnance equipment, textiles and their equipment, aviation equipment, chemical engineering, and pharmaceutical instruments. However, there is a vehicle item in the U.S. military surplus materials, totaling US$7,794,352.15, and the vehicles were originally jeeps and trucks used by the U.S. military. In addition, there are automobile parts in the World Trade Corporation's materials, totaling US$185,927.26. In addition, it is learned that the bureau successively purchased 10 small cars, including five Austin cars imported on September 6, 1946. The factory habits did not exceed the prescribed quota, but they were put up for sale immediately without reporting to the customs for inspection. On February 28, 1947, five small cars were imported, including four Ford cars and one Cadillac car, which were said to have been approved by the Executive Yuan Secretariat in letter No. 11226 from the Congwu section, and were also not reported to the customs for inspection. In addition, on September 9, 1946, and April 17, 1947, three Buick cars were imported successively, all of which had permits and were inspected by the customs. In addition, the bureau purchased three refrigerators on December 22, 1946. It is found that the bureau's mission was originally to purchase and transport war-surplus materials on behalf of the government according to the law. The purchase and transportation of such cars and refrigerators has exceeded the bureau's business scope, and the bureau uses the convenience of transportation tools, and the usual import of materials does not need to be declared to the customs for inspection according to general import procedures. The import of these cars is actually not in compliance with the procedures.</p>
<p>World Trade Corporation (Universal Trading Corporation): It is found that the organization of the World Trade Corporation (referred to as the Unified Company by the Associated Press) was approved by the Trade Commission in October 1938 and registered in New York. At that time, the company's task was to sell domestic export tung oil and other products in the United States on behalf of the government to repay American loans. The Trade Commission organized the Fuxing Company and Fuhua Company in China to preside over the handling. The funds of each company were allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Although the loan was repaid, various parties needed more materials during the war, and the company was entrusted to purchase them in the United States. It is found that the company is located in New York, with Chen Guangfu as the chairman and Lechhead as the general manager, and Ren Sida and Xia Peng as the deputy general managers. In addition to the original entrusted work of the Trade Commission, the Executive Yuan instructed in July of this year to take over the work of the Washington Materials Supply Committee. All foreign ordering and urging of materials are handled by the company. However, since its establishment, although the company is a part of the Ministry of Finance in nature, it has no formal office in China, so the outside world is mostly unaware of the truth. Chinese and foreign newspapers even mistakenly regard it as an organization of "rich capital." Moreover, since the company is an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Finance, its annual operating accounts have not been reported (see the telegram from Lu Yinyou of the Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department). After urging in March of this year, the last year's balance sheet was submitted, in which general management and indirect expenses (General adminstiueand ceuerhead for expenses) reached US$361,290.06, and the reserve for contingencies (Reserueler contingencies) was US$1,800,000.00. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee once suggested to the Executive Yuan that the representative office of the Resources Committee in the United States, the Chinese Materials Committee in the United States, the office of the Ministry of Communications in the United States, and the office of the Ministry of Health in the United States should merge and unify the institutions to save expenses. Except for the Chinese Materials Committee in the United States, which has been abolished, other institutions continue to exist. In this way, not only does the government's foreign procurement of materials have a divergent appearance, but it also wastes foreign exchange, and it is necessary to unify and merge them as soon as possible. The content of the materials purchased by the World Trade Corporation itself is based on its office in the United States, and it is impossible to audit it. In the future, there should be strict audit and supervision methods to avoid waste. Moreover, the business of the Materials Supply Bureau and the purchasing department of the Central Trust Bureau is also similar to that of the company (the entrusted materials of the Central Trust Bureau and the purchased and transported materials of the Materials Supply Bureau all have the company's entrusted items), and it is also necessary to unify them as soon as possible. (Relevant documents on the World Trade Corporation are stored in the Ministry of Finance). (Continued on page 5)</p>

<h3>The Formation of Confrontation Between the Eastern and Western Blocs, the Hope of Compromise Between the United States and the Soviet Union is Slim, the United Nations General Assembly Enters its Fourth Week with No Achievements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, October 6] The Soviet Union's new international communist organization plunged the United Nations General Assembly into chaos on October 6, shattering any hopes that the Eastern and Western blocs might reconcile at this session of the General Assembly and other meetings to be held soon. At the same time as this shocking news was announced, representatives of various countries in the United Nations felt more and more that the United States' original promise to strive for leadership could not be fulfilled. Secretary of State Marshall did not follow the expectations of the public and take on leadership, but has so far adopted a detached attitude. Some representatives to the General Assembly interpreted the Soviet Union's actions as a formal declaration of a "diplomatic war" that has been going on with Western countries for months. The collective organization of communist parties in nine European countries, the de facto new Communist International, is expected to soon be reflected in the various committees of the General Assembly. Representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries have already launched a major attack in the committees on the United States' "war-mongering," "imperialism," and "domination of the world." The smaller countries now predict that a large-scale political war is about to break out in the coming months.</p>
<p>The United States' plan at the United Nations has produced the following questionable progress: 1. The American candidate for the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, has failed. 2. Despite being in the minority, the United States strongly refused to have Ukraine replace Poland as a member of the Security Council, and is now advocating for India. 3. The United States had previously condemned Iran, Burma, and Afghanistan in strong terms as aggressors, but now, if the three countries agree to accept a new United Nations mission and cooperate with it, the United States is prepared to step back. 4. The United States submitted the Korean issue to the General Assembly. The Soviet Union's response was to suggest that the U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea before the end of this year. The United States has not yet been able to agree on a detailed counter-mechanism. 5. The U.S. delegation is still making a fuss and studying countermeasures against Vyshinsky's "war-mongering" accusations. 6. Marshall is still refusing to express the U.S.'s position on the status of Palestine. 7. Marshall's "small General Assembly" plan has not been met with enthusiasm. Even the United States' best friends, such as Britain, are not interested. The stalemate and propaganda speeches of the past three weeks have raised doubts as to whether the 57-nation General Assembly committee can resolve the paralysis of the Security Council.</p>
<h3>The United States Upholds the Spirit of Unyielding Perseverance for World Freedom and Prosperity, Austin Rejects Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, October 5] The U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, made a nationwide broadcast on October 5, which various parties recognize as a public statement in response to the European Communist Party's attack on the American capitalist system.</p>
<p>Although Austin did not mention the name of the Communist Party, nor did he directly mention the Soviet Union, he clearly stated that the United States is not intimidated by any propaganda campaign. At the same time, he refuted the Communist Party's attacks, saying that the United States has not tried to manipulate other countries economically or ideologically through the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, or other methods. We are working to achieve a situation where no country can dominate another. We are willing to fight resolutely for world recovery, world peace, and world stability, freedom and prosperity. I believe that the constructive forces currently being vigorously pursued at the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the recovery plan recently drafted by the sixteen countries, will eventually be successful.</p>
<h3>Eaton Frankly Criticizes the Soviet Union's Intimidation Campaign</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, October 5] The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eaton, yesterday criticized the recent Soviet accusation that the United States is a "war-monger" as part of an intimidation campaign. He pointed out: "We should have long ago learned a lesson from another dictator (this dictator is no longer with us), that the loudest and most violent cries are a kind of psychological offensive, sometimes used to conceal defeats, and sometimes to divert the attention of the people, in order to cover up the casualties inflicted on the people by the dictator."</p>
<h3>The UN Special Committee Debates the Palestine Issue, All Parties are Waiting for the US to Announce its Attitude</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] New York, October 6 Radio: Lake Success news: At 11:40 this morning, the UN Special Committee will resume its debate on the Palestine issue, and the first speaker will be Panama's representative Reyes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, October 5] It is heard that the United Nations' dispute over Palestine is approaching an important stage of development? Between October 6 and 9, the United States will definitely state its attitude regarding the future of Palestine, and what path it will take to resolve it. Although there are many rumors about Marshall's position on this issue, it is not known what his attitude is. Zionist officials believe that unless the United States adopts a friendly and firm position on the establishment of a Jewish state, the Zionist movement will have little chance of realizing its hopes. They deeply fear that the ambiguity of the United States' attitude will allow the Arabs to gain a practical victory and implement the demands of the independent Palestinian Arab state.</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Implementation of the US Aid to Europe Plan are Growing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] New York, October 6 Radio: Moscow's announcement of the revival of the Communist International may strengthen the forces in the US Congress that support President Truman's aid to Europe plan. The government hopes to convene a special session of Congress before December 1, and is currently waiting for members of Congress to make a final decision. Experts studying the aid to Europe plan believe that the US government can find a way to allocate 200 million yuan to meet the various urgent needs of Europe before the end of this year. If Congress does not convene a special session, it may approve 600 million to 800 million yuan when it reconvenes in January next year, and then make a unified plan when implementing the Marshall Plan. Also, it is reported that Truman is currently looking for a capable civil servant to be responsible for planning the aid plan. Baruch, who previously drafted the international control of atomic energy, has a very high voice.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, October 6] The Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bridges, convened the committee to meet on November 18 to review President Truman's temporary emergency aid plan of 527 million yuan to Europe. This is one of the four congressional bodies that must approve it before the plan can be implemented. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on November 10.</p>
<h3>300,000 Romanian People Hold a Grand Parade Demanding Severe Punishment of Opposition Party Leaders</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, October 5] Moscow Radio today broadcast a Tass news agency report from Romania, stating that 300,000 people participated in a parade and rally held in Romania to commemorate the 6th anniversary of the Greek National Liberation Front. According to Tass, the marching crowds carried small flags, demanding severe punishment of the arrested Romanian opposition leader Maniu. They accused him of being a puppet of the imperialists, preparing to make Romania suffer the fate of bloodshed again.</p>
<h3>The French Prime Minister's Official Residence is Bombed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] London, October 6 Radio: Paris News, French Prime Minister Ramadier's official residence in Decazeville, south-central France, was bombed today. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. It is reported that Ramadier went to Decazeville on Sunday to participate in the municipal election campaign, but the Prime Minister had already returned to Paris hours before the bomb exploded.</p>
<h3>Truman and Marshall Broadcast to the Nation, Calling on People to Fast to Help Western Europe to Contribute to World Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, October 6] President Truman today launched an unprecedented "self-denial" offensive against the famine in Western Europe, advocating frugality in diet as America's contribution to peace. The President asked the people of the country not to eat meat on Tuesdays, eggs and poultry on Thursdays, and to save a slice of bread every day.</p>
<p>In addition, he also asked the grain exchange to increase the cash payable by the buyer to 33.33% to prevent speculation. Another White House request was that the brewing industry should stop work for 60 days at the earliest, which brewers called a bolt from the blue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, October 5] Secretary of State Marshall broadcast that food is the most critical factor in American foreign policy, and the American people's attitude towards food can promote or destroy world peace and security. "From today until the end of winter at the latest, American men, women and children will exert their personal power in international affairs. The relationship between American individuals and world affairs has become clear. Our foreign policy has entered the homes of Americans and is eating at the same table with Americans. If there is a severe winter and scarcity, the European economy may collapse immediately, and we will also be severely affected."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, October 5] President Truman's Civil Food Committee initiated a campaign to save wheat by the bushel to help Western Europe, and today has secured a partial guarantee from the national industry, allowing the savings of 7.5 million bushels of wheat.</p>
<h3>Turkish Military Delegation Visits the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, October 5] Turkish Chief of Staff General Tak, leading 15 senior staff officers, left Turkey for the United States by plane today to negotiate with the U.S. military authorities on providing military supplies to Turkey. On the way back, Austin should visit the UK at the invitation of the British General Staff.</p>

<p>today, through former mayor of Hokkaido's Esashi City, Ando, appealed to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee for the return of three islands currently occupied by the Soviet Union, including Shikotan. The Japanese fundamentally do not recognize Shikotan Island as part of the Kuril Islands. The Foreign Affairs Committee has already submitted the matter to a small committee for study. According to a resolution passed by the Hokkaido prefectural assembly last August, the government demanded that the three islands be returned to Japan.</p>
<h3>Itagaki Seishiro on Trial Claims Our Army Started the Northeast Incident</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal began hearing the case of Itagaki Seishiro, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, one of the main war criminals, on the 6th. He insisted that the September 18, 1931 Northeast Incident was merely an accidental encounter and not a planned invasion, and was in fact caused by constant acts of sabotage by Chinese troops. The defense lawyer also claimed that Itagaki's entry into the Konoe Cabinet as Minister of the Army was for the purpose of assisting Konoe in discussing the withdrawal of Japanese troops in order to peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese Incident.</p>
<h3>Gold Mine Discovered in Northern Burma, Reserves Richer than India</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 6th (broadcast): Rangoon dispatch. Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu announced at a press conference today that two large gold mines have been discovered in northern Burma, with reserves even larger than India's Kolar Gold Fields. The Burmese government is currently planning to develop them. The Kolar Gold Fields produced 221,976 ounces in 1944.</p>
<h3>Crisis in India's Civil War</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 6th] On the 6th, Indian naval, land, and air forces suddenly landed in the Princely State of Junagadh, located between Bombay and Karachi, occupying 3,000 square miles, sharply increasing the risk of armed conflict between India and Pakistan.</p>
<h3>Rotary International President to Visit China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canberra, 6th] Rotary International President Corns, currently traveling here in the name of a world tour for the organization, will be leaving here for China in the near future. However, due to the hurried nature of Mr. Corns's world tour, he only intends to make a goodwill visit to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Communist International Declares Revival, Launches Full-Scale Anti-American Campaign</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Political figures here believe that the establishment of a joint bureau in Belgrade by the communist parties of nine European countries is intended to unite communist forces to resist the Marshall Plan and general American policy. The position of Italy and France in this new Communist International is intended to counter the importance the United States places on the development of the two countries. It is worth remembering that when the Marshall Aid proposal was first put forward, the Italian Communist Party initially supported Italy's participation, and the communist parties of Czechoslovakia and Poland did not oppose it.</p>
<p>Recent Activities of European Communists</p>
<p>Since the conference of communist parties from many countries in London in February to attend the British Communist Party congress, the efforts of Western European communist parties to take independent action have become increasingly clear. Subsequently, the communist parties of France, Belgium, and Italy withdrew from coalition cabinets one after another, and recently the British Communist Party has also changed from conditionally supporting the Labour government to unconditionally opposing the Labour government. The French Communist Party has announced that it will implement education for party members to instill trust in Stalinism. In Eastern Europe, the connection between the Communist Party and other parties has also been severed. The attempt by Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia to establish a Socialist Party agreement to merge political parties has failed. Recent executive committee meetings of the Socialist parties of Hungary and Czechoslovakia not only refused to merge with the Communist Party, but also refused to issue any joint declarations in the future. The relationship between the Socialist parties of Romania and Bulgaria and the Communist Party is still pending. It is expected that in Eastern European countries, the offensive against those within the Socialist Party who oppose merging with the Communist Party will be intensified. Since the new treaties with former enemy countries came into effect, the technical obstacles to the formation of joint organizations between Allied countries and political parties in former enemy countries have been removed. The communist parties in European countries that have not yet joined this new Communist International include those of Scandinavia, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, and the United Kingdom. Generally speaking, the communist parties in these countries are unlikely to have a reasonable opportunity to gain power.</p>
<p>Moscow Observers See Great Significance</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] Observers here generally believe that the establishment of the nine-nation Communist Party Committee in Belgrade is the most important development in communist politics since the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943. It is the first time that the Soviet Communist Party, together with foreign communist parties, has openly declared that the world has been split into two major fronts. It is a public and concrete action to mobilize communist forces to resist imperialism, and its significance is increased by the strength of the communist parties in France and Italy. Its intention is to openly declare war on US-centered imperialism, to expand communist power everywhere in the world, and to jointly formulate a plan to resist financial imperialism.</p>
<p>Washington Closely Watching the Communist Party's All-Out Anti-American Campaign</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The US government today believes that the European Nine-Nation Communist Party Conference and its political declaration against the US, announced by Moscow, show a revival of the pre-war Soviet-manipulated international communist movement. Moscow's announcement proves its determination to launch a full-scale campaign against the United States and its foreign policy and leaders in order to gain control of Western Europe and other strategic locations in the world. This action is identical to what the Soviet Union is currently doing at the United Nations General Assembly. Until recently, the Soviet side had openly denied that communism was an organized international movement. Stalin announced the dissolution of the Communist International during the war to strengthen relations with the United Kingdom and the United States, especially with the United States, in order to obtain military equipment under Lend-Lease for the war against Germany; however, times have changed, and the Third International seems to be reusable.</p>
<p>British Communist Party Expresses Complete Surprise</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] A member of the British Communist Party said that the news of the establishment of the Communist International organization came as a complete surprise to the British Communist Party. Left-wing Labour MP "rebel" leader Crossman said, "I believe that Moscow is not satisfied with the independence granted to the communist parties of various countries, and therefore it is necessary to correct it." But for the Socialist parties of Western Europe, this can serve as a warning to quickly organize a joint organization of Western European Socialist parties to implement a common policy.</p>
<p>French Political Circles Observe that the Soviet Union Will Adopt a New Policy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] French political figures believe that the establishment of the new Communist International is a precursor to the Soviet Union's adoption of a new policy towards Western countries, especially France and Italy. Some observers believe that this move indicates the Kremlin's fear that the Soviet Union will become more isolated after the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in November. The declaration of the leaders of the nine communist parties is intended to make the French and Italian communist parties completely embrace the Soviet Union. French Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez addressed 10,000 people in Béziers, southern France, today, condemning American bankers for oppressing the French government and preventing the Communist Party from participating in the cabinet.</p>
<p>De Gaulle and Austrian Foreign Minister Vigorously Criticize the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 6th] De Gaulle said at a political gathering here on the 5th that the United States's resolute anti-Soviet stance is extremely important for French security. De Gaulle said that the United States has preserved its strength to counter the Soviet Union's ambitions in the world. The people of our country especially understand this guarantee, although indirect, is very important.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 5th] 50,000 members of the Austrian People's Party convened a conference here today, and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber attended the conference and delivered a speech, commenting on the Communist Party's organization of international organizations, saying that the Communist Party has been mobilized and will use the needs of the Austrian people to seize power. Gruber then vigorously criticized the Communist Party's propaganda, and said that Austria's basic interest lies in hoping that neighboring countries, especially the Soviet Union, will not support the internal conspiracies launched by the Communist Party. Austrian Deputy Minister of the Interior Graf denounced the Communist Party for preparing a complete set of conspiracies and declared that Austria would never submit to its threats.</p>

<h3>Sino-US Air Route Officially Opens, "Nanjing" Arrives Safely in Guam, Flies to Honolulu Today, Arrives in San Francisco on the 9th, Journalists and Others Invited to Visit the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Sino-US direct air route, which has been in preparation for many years, officially opened its first flight at the Shanghai airport yesterday morning. A DC-4 type four-engine "Nanjing" "Sky Master" giant aircraft stood majestically in the center of the airport. Under the bright morning sun, the silver gleamed brilliantly, and the Chinese and American flags fluttering on the left and right sides of the aircraft's nose complemented each other, greatly increasing its magnificence. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) General Manager Liu Jingyi arrived at the airport at 7:30 AM to warmly greet the guests. Mayor Wu and his wife, US Consul General Davis and his wife, Speaker Pan, and the press figures who were invited to visit the United States, including Zeng Xubai, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Information Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Chen Xunyu, General Manager and Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, Zhao Minzhi, Editor-in-Chief of the Xinwen Daily, Fei Yimin, Deputy Manager of the Ta Kung Pao, Yu Bin, Chairman of the Yishi Daily, Bu Qingmao, Publisher of the Tianjin Minguo Daily, and more than ten others, as well as 15 CNAC employees traveling to the United States and 12 ordinary passengers, arrived one after another. Wang Xiaolai also took off his long robe yesterday and changed into a brand-new Western suit that he rarely wore, frequently nodding and saying goodbye to the business representatives and Shanghai Miss Wang Yunmei and others who were seeing them off.</p>
<p>The Sino-US air route opens, and journalists and others are invited to take the first passenger plane to visit the United States. (Top photo) This newspaper's General Manager Chen Xunyu and Wang Xiaolai pose for a photo with the send-off party when boarding the plane. From right: Speaker Pan, Chen Xunyu, Wang Xiaolai, Mayor Wu and his wife, and US Consul General Davis. (Bottom photo) The Mayor's wife performs the bottle-breaking ceremony, pouring the seawater onto the nose of the plane. Standing behind is CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi. (Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM, a simple opening ceremony was held. First, Liu Jingyi delivered a speech, briefly stating: "The opening of Sino-US flights not only shortens the distance between China and the United States and enhances friendly relations, but also opens a new page in the history of international civil aviation." The original speech was recorded by CNAC and made into a film, which will be combined with the Pan American Airlines commemoration of the opening ceremony in San Francisco and preserved as a permanent memorial. Subsequently, Mayor Wu's wife performed the bottle-breaking ceremony. The white long-necked bottle was filled with seawater brought from San Francisco Bay. Because it was carefully carried from a long distance, the mouth of the bottle was tightly sealed. Liu Jingyi used force to peel it off, and it took five minutes to open it. In front of more than 200 guests, Mrs. Wu slowly poured the bottle of water onto the nose of the plane. This ceremony was completed, and the engines started accordingly.</p>
<p>The "Nanjing" aircraft was piloted by pilot Chen Qifa yesterday. He joined CNAC in 1935. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was responsible for transportation work and flew over the Hump 600 times. He is one of the most outstanding aviation talents in our country. There were 44 seats in the cabin, and everyone took their seats according to their assigned numbers. Flight attendants He Shuzhen, Deng Xiuzhen, and Chen Menghua provided onboard service. The aircraft took off at 9:10 AM and arrived safely in Guam at about 7:00 PM. It is reported that after arriving in Honolulu today, it will stay for one day for all the tourists to visit, and it will fly to San Francisco at noon on the 9th.</p>
<p>After the personnel on the plane arrive in San Francisco, some of them will be accompanied by CNAC staff to visit New York, Washington, and other places. Others, such as Liu Jingyi, will go to Brazil, and Yu Bin will stay in the United States for a month and then go to Rome on a special mission. The aircraft will return to Shanghai on the 12th and will fly to the United States again on the 17th. The group of visitors will return to China in due course on appropriate flights.</p>
<p>The Sino-US air route was prepared based on the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement signed on December 20, 1946. In January of this year, the Ministry of Communications designated CNAC as the company to operate Sino-US flights. CNAC then sent aircraft for two test flights on January 23 and March 29, which were successful. The route via Guam, Wake Island, Honolulu, and San Francisco was officially decided. In May of this year, CNAC applied for permission from the US Civil Aeronautics Administration, and it was officially opened after President Truman signed and approved it recently.</p>
<p>According to CNAC officials, the company's South Pacific route has been in trial operation since August, and everything is now ready, and it will be opened soon. The company is also applying to the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo for the Sino-Japanese route. Once approved, it can be started.</p>

<h3>Classmate, Mother and Son, Lovers, A Triple Relationship, A Tortuous Marriage, A Strange Family Change, Free Love Disregards Ethics</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The District Court accepted a bizarre case yesterday, which was almost incestuous in nature, with a tortuous plot and full of dramatic meaning. The male and female protagonists were classmates six years ago, mother and son three years ago, and are currently "husband and wife". There is a person named Li Chengshan, who is a businessman from Guangdong. There is a daughter named Peihua, who is now 25 years old. She is of mixed Chinese and Korean descent. She is beautiful and graceful. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chengshan's goods stored in Hong Kong were looted, resulting in huge losses. Chengshan wanted to make up for the losses and borrowed cash from his friend Jie Jing. Jie readily agreed, but on the condition that he wanted to marry Li Peihua as his second wife, as his wife had been bombed to death during the war. Li Chengshan readily agreed. Unexpectedly, Li Peiju and Jie Zixiong were classmates in middle school and had a good relationship and close contacts. If she married Jie Jingzhai, her future situation would be very difficult, and Jing was over half a hundred years old, and the combination of beauty and white hair was not suitable, so Peihua firmly refused to obey. Later, Li Chengshan threatened to commit suicide and forced Peihua to marry Jie Jing, and Peihua had no choice but to agree, and telegraphed Jie Zhixiong, who was studying in Berlin at the time, urging him to return. When Zhixiong returned to China, Peihua had already married Jie Jingzhai, and the former close friend had become a stepmother. In order to take care of the family, Jie Jingzhai ordered Zhixiong to get engaged to a woman named Su Yiyun. On the eve of the wedding this year, Jie Zhixiong suddenly fled from Guangzhou with his stepmother Li Peihua, each leaving a letter to Jie Jingzhai, roughly saying that modern marriage should be voluntary and free love, how can we still follow the feudal society's buying and selling method and force it to be implemented? Now we are far away from your evil family, even if you want to find us for thousands of miles, it will be in vain, etc. Jie Jingzhai did not investigate, but Su Yiyun intended to marry someone else. Because she had a marriage contract with Jie Zhixiong, she intended to request its dissolution. Guan Jie Zhixiong and Li Peihua are in Shanghai, especially stating the above process and applying to the Shanghai District Court for permission to dissolve the marriage contract.</p>
<h3>Extorting Comfort Money in Someone Else's Name, Civil Affairs Bureau Sends People to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Xiaosong made a statement: Although Shanghai is richer than the mainland, the wealth of each district and bao is different. Citizens donate comfort money and physical objects out of willingness to help, and they naturally consider the differences in wealth in each district and bao, so they naturally cannot be uniform. However, recently, rumors have spread that soldiers from a certain unit have personally gone to each district and bao with fellow volunteers to solicit comfort money and cashmere sweaters, forcing districts and baos to pay car fees, and even forcing them at midnight. If there are people who come to extort money in someone else's name, the people of the district and bao can ignore them. This bureau has sent people to investigate.</p>
<h3>Fire in Nanjing Road at Dusk, Hualian Tongle Club Destroyed, Several Neighbors Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Hualian Tongle Club at No. 194 Nanjing Road caught fire due to carelessness in the kitchen on the second floor at 6:00 PM last night, which spread to the storefronts of Fenghua Tobacco Shop, Wenxin Stationery Company, and Shanghai Xingye Trust Company. The upper parts were all destroyed by fire, causing considerable losses. At the same time, Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in Lane 208 were also burned down. Fortunately, the fire trucks arrived one after another at 6:30 PM, and the business office of the Ta Kung Pao next door was not affected, only the second floor was slightly stained with water and suffered a false alarm. A quarter of an hour after the fire broke out, with the help of the wind, it quickly penetrated the roof. At that time, it was when the lights of Nanjing Road were just starting to come on, and pedestrians were bustling, so the situation was extremely chaotic for a while. Soon, police officers gathered, and fire trucks from various districts came one after another, and they tried their best to put out the fire. Traffic was not fully restored until about 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Base Pay, Index-Based Wages, Five Theaters Lost 300 Million, 1,000 Yuan Promise Resolved Happily</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The labor-capital dispute over the salaries of the troupe at the Tianchan, Huangjin, China, Da Stage, and Gong Stage five Peking opera theaters was mediated by the Social Bureau, which convened both labor and capital parties to negotiate at the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was resolved satisfactorily at 6:00 PM, and minutes were signed on the spot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the representatives of the capital side who attended were Zhou Jianxing, Chairman of the Peking Opera Theater Association, Wang Qijun of the China Grand Theater, Zhou Xiru of the Huangjin Grand Theater, Zhang Shanshan of the Gong Stage, Fan Hengyu of the Da Stage, and Tang Pingfan of the Tianchan Wutai. The representatives of the labor side who attended were Ma Qingyun, Qiu Wangcheng, Wu Sibao, Bai Wenliang, Ju Zhenhe, and Shen Jisheng. Meng Song from the Social Bureau attended and presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Three Conditions</p>
<p>In addition to discussing the issue of converting wages into base pay based on the cost-of-living index, the capital side also proposed three conditions: Compensation for the losses of the theaters on the evening of the 4th; employees publish an apology in the newspaper; and wages for employees who stopped performing that evening will be deducted. After Meng Song from the Bureau repeatedly persuaded and negotiated, the employees first published an apology in the newspaper. Regarding the deduction of wages for the evening of the performance, because the employees' income was limited, the capital side agreed that the employees would jointly donate 1 million yuan, half to the Peking Opera Theater Association and half to the Lingjie United Association. Regarding the loss of 300 million yuan to the five theaters due to the suspension of performances, the two sides argued fiercely. The employees could not afford it at all due to their meager income. Zhou Jianxing said that although he knew that the employees could not afford to pay compensation, even paying one yuan would be acceptable. After Zhou finished speaking, Ma Qingyun, a representative of the labor side, took out a piece of 1,000 yuan banknote from the Central Bank from his pocket and claimed that he represented all the employees to pay compensation. Zhou took it in the same way. The whole room was filled with laughter and applause, and the labor and capital sides signed the minutes in this harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Agreed on Base Pay</p>
<p>According to the regulations, both parties agreed to the following base pay: Those whose wages are below 700,000 will be converted into base pay. It will be 40 yuan in October and 42 yuan in November, and it will not be changed again in the future. For those who exceed 700,000, 700,000 will be used as the base, converted to 42 yuan, and the rest will be extrapolated according to the monthly index, limited to the original salary of 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Prices Will Rise Again</p>
<p>According to Zhou Jianxing and Wang Qijun, after this adjustment of employee treatment, the expenditure increased by 75% compared to before, so ticket prices will also be adjusted. However, the entertainment industry is already in a difficult situation, and ticket prices cannot be adjusted too high, otherwise it will be more difficult to develop business.</p>
<h3>Dongjiadu Robbery and Murder: A Mahjong Game Interrupted by Thugs, Three Deaths and Injuries at Wansheng Soy Sauce Shop</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 9 PM last night, a robber in uniform suddenly appeared at Wansheng Soy Sauce Shop, No. 109, South District Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Brandishing a wooden-cased gun, he encountered Hu Shiji (30 years old, residing in Fusantang Street, Shanghai), Huang Furong (40 years old, a local resident living in Xiaopi Lane), and others who were playing mahjong in the shop. They were forced into a room on the left (the Baozhang's office). When Hu and the others shouted for help, the robber fired several shots, fatally hitting Hu and Huang in vital areas, causing them to fall to the ground and die. A stray bullet also injured Zhang Fengbao (21 years old, from Chongming), an apprentice, in the left leg. The robber grabbed some legal tender from the counter and, afraid to leave through the main door, climbed onto the roof and escaped into a neighboring house. The Dongjiadu police station was notified, and Inspector Miao reported to the Penglai Police Branch, simultaneously ordering all plainclothes and uniformed police officers, including the police squad, to rush to the scene.

<h3>Five Robbery Suspects with Multiple Offenses: Hiding in Shanghai and Suzhou, Arrested One After Another</h3>

<h3>Business Bankruptcy, Owed Taxes: Should Be Distributed Equally with General Creditors, Unified Interpretation by the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the case of how to collect outstanding taxes from businesses that have declared bankruptcy due to poor business performance, the Ministry of Finance requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan twice in February of this year. The response stated: "After deliberation by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Yuan, it is resolved that when a taxpayer is declared bankrupt, the taxes owed before the declaration of bankruptcy, according to the provisions of Article 103, Paragraph 1 of the Bankruptcy Law, are not prohibited from being bankruptcy claims. If the law does not have provisions for priority of payment for such bankruptcy claims, they should be distributed equally with other bankruptcy claims." In short, after a store goes bankrupt, if there are no legal provisions for "priority of payment" for the taxes owed, they should be distributed equally with general claims. Otherwise, the taxes owed to the government should be paid in full before other debts can be paid. The city's Finance Bureau plans to implement this accordingly.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Flaunting Attire Hides Thief, Tricycle Driver Acts Righteously, Violent Thief Shoots Two People, Finally Shot Down and Captured, Turns Out to Be a Recent Ex-Convict</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Jiang Chen Juan, a young woman, lives at No. 7 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinzha Road. At 10:50 AM yesterday, dressed elegantly and carrying a basket, she went to the Chenjiabang vegetable market to buy vegetables. She wore two gold bracelets on her wrist, which caught the eye of a thief. As she returned home and was about to enter the back door of No. 7, she was accosted by two thieves who snatched the gold bracelets and put them in their pockets. The woman screamed, angering the thieves, who fired a shot, hitting her left leg and causing her to fall to the ground. At the same time, Tang Asheng, a 68-year-old neighbor, saw what was happening and helped to shout for help, which resulted in him also being grazed in the left ankle by shrapnel. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the two thieves fled. As they reached the lane, a tricycle driver, Jiang Rongsheng, chased after them, along Xinzha Road from west to east, turning into Chengdu North Road. Many people along the way helped in the chase. At this time, police officer Zhou Jiting, No. 1545, from the Chengdu Road Police Station, heard the news and joined the pursuit. When they reached Chengdu Road, Jiang Rongsheng caught up with one of the thieves and grabbed him. The thief fired two shots, hitting Jiang in the right arm and buttocks. In extreme pain, he let go. Police officer No. 1545 then fired six shots, hitting the thief holding the gun, two in the left leg and abdomen. After capturing him, he also confiscated the fast/slow machine gun he was holding, and checked the chamber to find fifteen bullets remaining. The other thief had escaped in the confusion. At the same time, the Xin Cheng Police Branch was notified, and Deputy Branch Chief Ding led squad members Gu Qiguan, Police Chief Ma Renyong, Zhao Yongji, and a large number of police officers in police vehicles to investigate. They immediately sent the injured victim and the righteous tricycle driver Jiang Rongsheng to the hospital for treatment. The wounded violent thief was taken to the station for questioning. He identified himself as Tang Ruyou, 32 years old, from Nantong, and had been a farmer in his original hometown. Four years ago, he joined the bandit army as a squad leader. He recently came to Shanghai. Later, police officers checked his fingerprints and discovered that he had committed two robbery cases and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He had just been released last month. He was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment. The stolen pair of gold bracelets were still taken away by the escaped thief, and are currently being pursued.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shankun's Accusation Case: Prosecutor Discusses Reasons for Delay</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of film figures Zhang Shankun, Chen Yunshang, and others, who were accused of being suspected traitors, has been under investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office for ten months without resolution. Yesterday, prosecutor Qu Rong, who is handling the case, stated: "Because it was rumored that Zhang Shankun and others were hiding in Hong Kong, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding it to the Hong Kong government, requesting the extradition of Zhang Shankun and others. Unexpectedly, no reply has been received for several months, which has made it impossible to close the case. A letter was recently sent to urge them. The reason for the delay of the case to this day lies in this." When asked about Zhang Shankun currently being wanted by order of the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, prosecutor Qu stated that he had not heard of it.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Silver Hidden in a Tobacco Shop: 10,000 Taels</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau raided Zhengyu Tobacco Shop at No. 507 Sichuan Middle Road yesterday afternoon and seized smuggled silver, including 8,100 silver dollars, 4,350 silver dimes, 17 silver ingots weighing 50 taels each, 55 weighing 20 taels each, 55 weighing 10 taels each, 15 silver bars, and a bag of small silver ingots, totaling over 12,000 taels, worth over 400 million legal tender at market prices. According to Liu Yusan, the manager of the shop, this silver was gradually purchased at the store during the occupation of Shanghai, fearing that the enemy and puppets would discover it, so it was secretly hidden in a specially made concealed wooden box, covered with rice and placed on a small shelf on the second floor. Recently, the structure collapsed due to excessive load, leading to its discovery and a confidential report that the shop was engaged in black market trading of gold and currency.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Kuomintang Party Headquarters Holds Grand Tea Party to Welcome Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Cheng Tianfang</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Kuomintang Party Headquarters and district party branches held a grand tea party at the Police Recreation Center yesterday afternoon to welcome Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Cheng Tianfang. More than 600 people from all walks of life attended, including Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, and Shao Shuiping. After Chairman Fang Zhi delivered a welcome address, Zhang Zhizhong gave a speech, saying that he came to Shanghai for a short rest and that it was inconvenient to talk about military or diplomatic affairs. He had seen the plays "Handsome Man" and "Fake Falsehood" in Shanghai, which were very humorous and relaxing, and implied two principles of life: "Honest people may suffer small losses, but ultimately benefit," and "If hypocrisy can be eliminated, any problem can be solved." He also said, "The merger of the party and the youth league is a wise and great measure. It is hoped that comrades can understand, tolerate, trust each other, and make the party a pure and revolutionary group. With the enemy at the door today, there is no room for disputes and friction. It is better for individuals to suffer small losses than to let the revolution suffer big losses. If we can do this, the current difficult period will surely pass quickly."</p>
<p>Creating a New Revolutionary Shanghai</p>
<p>After Zhang's speech, Chiang Ching-kuo was invited to speak. Chiang said briefly that he came to Shanghai to handle the merger of the party and the youth league, and would handle everything with a learning attitude. He said that he had traveled all over the country and liked Dihua the most and Shanghai the least. But Shanghai is the heart of our country and must establish a new spirit and create a new revolutionary Shanghai. Cheng Tianfang's speech detailed his impressions of the United States, saying that the United States was amazing in its development of transportation and telecommunications, its rapid technological progress, and the surge in the number of university students after the war, with more than three million students in colleges and universities across the country, many times more than before the war. Such widespread higher education has a profound impact on the future of society. The high standard of living of its people is unparalleled by other countries, with an average annual income of $1,300 per person. The high national income is enviable. The total number of unemployed people in the United States is only 500,000, which is not a threat to social security.</p>
<p>Shortcomings of American Society</p>
<p>But on the other hand, American society also has its shortcomings. The main ones are: extreme waste of resources, low social morality, and increased crime, especially the dramatic increase in juvenile delinquency, which is even more worrying. According to U.S. government statistics, there were 200,000 cases of juvenile delinquency in the past year, which is alarming. Prices continue to rise and have not been controlled, and labor strikes occur from time to time. Experts speculate that a recession is inevitable. Cheng then analyzed the United States' attitude towards China in detail, pointing out that the recent misunderstandings and prejudices of the United States towards China are due to the following reasons: The long-term and organized malicious propaganda of the American Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party in the United States. American journalists suffered material hardships in China's wartime capital during the war and were deeply resentful of the wartime news censorship system, so they made various comments unfavorable to China after returning home. And in today's America, only works that criticize China can gain both fame and fortune. For example, American journalist Theodore White, who had no reputation before, wrote a book "Thunder Out of China" after returning home, which completely distorted China, but sold 400,000 to 500,000 copies and made him famous.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong giving a speech (Our newspaper photo)</p>
<p>Strengthening Publicity to the United States</p>
<p>U.S. Army and Air Force personnel who served in China during the war felt the hardship of material life and developed dissatisfaction. After returning home, they often made unfavorable remarks about China. Many officials in the U.S. government are left-leaning and often deliberately publish documents unfavorable to China, while refusing to publish those favorable to China. The anti-government propaganda of Chinese living in the United States, including senior officials and visiting professors, greatly damages the credibility of the government. For example, at the 200th anniversary of Princeton University, a lecture on Far East issues was held, and a Chinese professor criticized the government more fiercely than the Americans criticized the Chinese government, which local newspapers considered important news. At the same time, on the other hand, China's overseas propaganda agencies have never actively promoted the government's policies and the Kuomintang's ideology, which is also a reason why Americans misunderstand us. However, Cheng believes that there is no need to be pessimistic about this situation, and that we should consider strengthening propaganda and communication between China and the United States to correct the wrong impressions of the United States and South Korea about us. The conference ended at about 5 p.m. in a harmonious atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Difficulties Encountered During the Rehabilitation of the Zibo Mining Area</h3>
<p>[Our report from Jinan, 2nd dispatch] My general impression of this trip to Zibo is: "The roads are fit for ghosts, the drinks are gruel, and the lodging is in widows' villages."</p>
<p>The expression "The roads are fit for ghosts" refers, on the one hand, to the fact that the roads are so bad that it is unimaginable. Our six-wheeled Dodge truck was driving on them as slowly and laboriously as a water buffalo plowing a paddy field. For example, on the first day, we used 25 gallons of gasoline to travel from Jinan to Longshan, a total of only 35 kilometers, overturning once and almost overturning more than ten times. Everyone was on high alert, ready to register with King Yama at any time, this is the first point. Secondly, the local guerrillas still often appeared along both sides of the road. We encountered a Communist attack when we visited the Nandings lightweight metal factory and a larger attack at Yazhuang between Zhangdian and Zhoucun. Before our car reached Mashangzhuang, before Yazhuang, the car</p>
<p>got stuck in the mud</p>
<p>and could not get out. With great difficulty, we found many wooden boards, used towing ropes and pulling, and drove out of the mud pit. When we reached Yazhuang, the village was on a tributary of the Xiaoqing River, and we happened to meet the Communists who had removed several stone slabs from the bridge, ready to install fuses and bury landmines. Fortunately, the car arrived a few minutes early and the mines had not been buried yet. When fifty or sixty guerrillas heard the sound of the car engine, they hid in the green gauze tents on both sides of the river. Even more fortunate was that we all got out of the car when it crossed the river. Otherwise, if the bandits concentrated their fire on the car, there would inevitably have been deaths and injuries. However, it was unfortunate that the twenty or so soldiers we were carrying were composed of various companies of the engineering corps, superficially led by a company instructor, but they did not obey orders in danger and fled on their own. The only two light machine guns we had could not fire a single bullet because the gunners were flustered and the bullets came loose. So, when our car had just crossed the river and the bandits in the sorghum fields on both sides of the river concentrated their fire on us, our soldiers, in addition to firing a few rifles randomly, only managed to break through the encirclement and flee on their own. After running wildly for five or six miles, we finally entered a safe zone. When we arrived in Zhoucun that day, it was said that five groups of returning refugees, a total of more than thirty people, had been robbed at the same location before and after us, with two deaths, three injuries, and five captured. The common people had no military force, became refugees, and were robbed. Isn't this the road to King Yama?</p>
<p>In the villages I passed along the way, I witnessed that the living standards of the common people had been depressed to the lowest level. Every day they drink soup made of bran, millet noodles, sorghum flour, etc. This kind of soup cannot be named, it can only be called "gruel". And in the villages along the way, except for old men and groups of naked children, there were only women. When asked about their "shopkeeper" (the Shandong term for husband), they either said: "He fled to Jinan and has not returned" or said that he had been killed or captured by the Eighth Route Army! Isn't this situation</p>
<p>a widows' village?</p>
<p>But Liang, the head of the Zhou branch of the United Logistics Headquarters who had just entered Boshan from the Yimeng Mountain area, told me: "Being able to live in a widows' village is considered good. In the Yimeng Mountain area, you often can't see anyone for hundreds of miles, you can't see a complete house, and the weeds grow taller than the trees. It is ten times more miserable than Ruijin Xingguo in southern Jiangxi in the past."</p>
<p>Since the original local military force in central Shandong was reorganized into provincial security regiments when they retreated during the Laiwu campaign this spring due to lack of funds, all the security regiments may not be stationed in their original counties after this rehabilitation. Therefore, the local military force is very weak. The refugees who returned to their hometowns from the rear were lucky enough to pass the road of King Yama. Except for those in the cities who could return home, the others who originally lived in the countryside still could not return to their hometowns when they arrived in the county seat. In better situations, they only returned home during the day and still lived in the city at night. The main reason for this is that the vast area of the entire countryside is still the world of the guerrillas. The Communists also organized "Home Guard Brigades" in various places to "protect the fruits of struggle distributed to poor farmers." At the same time, in order to facilitate their operations, they strictly prohibit the people from cutting sorghum, on pain of death. Although the crops in various places have</p>
<p>a good harvest, farmers</p>
<p>are still mostly hesitant and dare not harvest. The original system of township chiefs and Baos and Jias of the county government mostly live in the city and dare not go to the countryside. In this way, not only can government orders not be implemented, but it also forms the strange phenomenon that refugees who have arrived in their own county from the rear are still refugees.

<h3>Communist Attack on Xinfeng City Fails</h3>
<p>[Our report from Jingjiang, 4th dispatch] About 500 members of the Communist pseudo-Jingjiang Independent Regiment were stirring up trouble in the Lao Jujia Village north of Shenghuo Town, destroying the roads and power lines in the vicinity, and attacking Xinfeng City.

<h3>Wu Asks Zhejiang Province's Ten Districts and Counties to Change Field Tax to Coarse Rice, Cereal Department's Reply Denies</h3>
<p>[Our report from Pinghu, 5th dispatch] The councils of the ten districts and counties previously sent a joint telegram to the provincial government asking it to forward to the central government a request to change the grain tax to coarse rice because they were not used to storing grain. Recently, they received a reply from the Ministry of Food, stating that it was not appropriate to allow it. The provincial government has forwarded the reply to each county for notification.</p>
<p>[Our report from Yixing, 5th dispatch] The county council of this county believes that the field tax for the 36th year is scheduled to be levied on October 1st, but the autumn harvest period in this county usually does not begin until the last ten days of October (around the Frost's Descent), and the medium-colored indica and japonica rice have not yet been harvested. With the start of the levy approaching, the people are unable to pay, and there are real difficulties. A separate telegram was sent to the provincial government and the Provincial Grain Office, requesting that the start date of the field tax be postponed by one month to November 1st, in order to relieve the farmers' difficulties.</p>
<p>[Our report from Shangrao, 4th dispatch] The Jiangxi Provincial Field Tax and Grain Management Office believes that Huang, the county magistrate of Yujiang County, has handed over the allocated and transported grain in full, and has even over-transported it, especially in assisting grain transport agencies on weekdays. His efforts have been presented to the provincial government for approval and recorded as a major merit for encouragement.</p>
<h3>Inspector Zhu Arrives in Haining, Talks to Our Reporter About Impressions of Trip</h3>
<p>[Our Haining Dispatch, 5th] Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang, accompanied by his secretary Lu Qimei, arrived in this county from Chongde on the evening of the 4th to inspect. On the morning of the 5th, he inspected various county-level agencies and the county-run middle school. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, he convened a symposium with various agencies and organizations. The reporter visited him and he expressed: This inspection covered ten districts, including Jiashan, Tongxiang, and Chongde counties. He listened to reports from the people's representative bodies in each county. The most important issues that could potentially lead to corruption were military service and grain requisition. It is regrettable that the counties only provided oral reports on the lack of integrity among tax collectors, without providing substantial evidence. In all counties, household registration, land administration, and civil administration were generally completed on time, but opium and gambling could not be completely eradicated. The general state of hygiene in all counties was very poor, rivers were unclean, and education funding was limited. Inspector Zhu concluded: Simplifying county administration and enhancing the authority of county magistrates is an urgent matter. The tax burden on the counties in the ten districts is relatively high, which is very unfair. He hopes that the central government can find ways to rectify this in the future. However, self-sufficiency in food and military strength is a national policy already set by the central government, and he hopes that all efforts can be made to minimize all malpractices.</p>
<p>[Our Tongxiang Dispatch, 3rd] Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang and his party of three arrived in to inspect on the afternoon of the 2nd, and convened a grain industry symposium at the County Government Auditorium on the 3rd. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, accompanied by his secretary Qimei and two others, they took a boat to Chong to inspect.</p>

<p>The Hengyuan Fabric Factory, located on Sanbao Street outside the West Gate of this county, recently expanded its factory buildings and added a new boiler. It was installed and tested on the evening of the 4th. Because the workers were unfamiliar with the boiler's properties and were negligent in their inspection, the steam overheated, causing a sudden explosion. With a thunderous sound, three rooms housing the boiler and starch vats were destroyed. Copper smith Chen Baolin was killed instantly, and Qin Tugeng was severely injured, his flesh mangled beyond recognition, a truly horrific sight. Two other workers, Wang Gengsheng and others, suffered minor injuries. It is reported that the losses will be over six to seven hundred million.</p>

<h3>Falsely Accused of Stealing Clothes, Nearly Died - Villager Hanged from Beam, Rope Breaks, Seriously Injured - Liu Houqing Summoned by the Judicial Office of Chuansha County Government</h3>
<p>[Chuansha Dispatch, 6th] Chu Gengsheng, a 22-year-old villager of Qingxiang Township, Chuansha County, makes a living by farming and has no siblings, relying on his mother and son to depend on each other. He was falsely accused of stealing woolen clothes from a neighbor surnamed Wu. On the 30th of last month, he was arrested by armed members of the Self-Defense Corps, Niu Hancheng, and others dispatched by Liu Houqing, the township head, and taken to the township office. That night, he was subjected to brutal torture, including the use of "tiger benches" and "three hangings", to force a confession. While being hanged from a beam, the rope broke and he fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. He fainted on the spot and foamed at the mouth with blood. The perpetrators, seeing this, feared that he might die and immediately called for a doctor to treat him. After he woke up, he was sent back home and his family was threatened not to publicize the matter. Neighbors who witnessed this felt indignant. The mother of the victim, Chu Gengsheng, cried day and night. Later, with the help of relatives and friends, she sued the county government on the 4th. County Magistrate Wu was extremely angry upon hearing this and immediately ordered the Judicial Office to issue a warrant for interrogation, which is scheduled to begin today. The victim, Chu Gengsheng, hired a boat to go to the city to treat his injuries on the morning of the 5th. When he set off, he was threatened and enticed by people sent by the township head to stop him from returning home. The township head, Liu Houqing, relying on the support of influential figure Song in the county, usually incites his subordinates to be tyrannical in the village, forcibly collecting various unwarranted donations and arbitrarily detaining villagers, which has long aroused resentment among the people of the whole village. In this case, after the regular bureau's interrogation, Liu and others will find it difficult to escape the clutches of the law.</p>

Others are still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Supervisory Yuan Report (Continued from Page 2) Full Text (E) Investigation of Automobile Imports</h3>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance and the return to the capital, the number of luxurious cars in Beijing, Shanghai and other places has been increasing. This phenomenon is unavoidable to be criticized by all parties during this period of thrift and national construction. After checking, these cars have been continuously imported from the following sources in the past two years, in addition to those left by public and private institutions during the enemy and puppet era. Before March 4th of last year, because all materials were freely imported, there was no limit to the amount or price, so during this period, many private individuals purchased luxurious cars from abroad. Since March 4th of last year, the import of cars with a factory price of more than US$1,200 has been prohibited. At the same time, the import of cars with a factory price of less than US$1,200 has been restricted. A total of 1,251 cars were approved for import in the winter of last year, with a total value of US$1,806,924.00, distributed among 46 Chinese and foreign companies, of which Ford Motor Company had the most, with 382 cars, worth US$500,984.00 (see Annex 18). Imports were suspended in the spring of this year. A total of 500 cars were approved for import in the summer of this year, with Ford having the most. The Executive Yuan specially approved the import of cars in two cases. The first case was the case of former President Song ordering the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 190 new and used sedans. The CTB received a telegram from the Washington Materials Supply Committee on July 9th, 35, stating: "President Song authorized the purchase of cars in the United States and shipped them to Shanghai, and reported the number to the bureau." The CTB approved the notification from the Executive Yuan Secretariat to handle it on its behalf, allocated it to various agencies for purchase and use, reported it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and approved the settlement of US$500,000 in foreign exchange. It also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inform the Customs Administration to instruct the Jianghai Customs to allow import. At the same time, the CTB received a telegram from former President Song of the Executive Yuan on August 2nd of last year, ordering it to report the shipment of these cars to Shanghai at any time for unified distribution by the Yuan. On September 27th, the CTB settled US$500,000 from the Central Bank at the then exchange rate of 3,350 yuan to the US dollar, for a total of 1,685 million yuan in legal currency. As of June 16th, 26, a total of 98 new cars and 30 used cars had not arrived. 62 of the new cars had arrived and were distributed (distributed during the tenure of former President Song). 19 of the cars that had not arrived were pre-allocated, leaving only 43 cars unallocated (37 cars are now being shipped and only 6 have not arrived, which are being distributed to various agencies by the current President Zhang). All the allocated cars that belong to the central party and government agencies include the National Government, the Executive, Judiciary, Examination, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and more than 30 units of the Central Party Headquarters. The local agencies and schools include the 11th War Zone, Jiangsu, Gansu, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other provincial and municipal governments and more than 10 units such as Beijing and Tsinghua Universities. Those who belong to private individuals or individuals with official titles (i.e., heads of agencies) include Mr. Song Ziwen, Mrs. Huang Yanbai, Mr. Li Shizeng, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Committee Member Kong, Minister Bai, Deputy Secretary-General Zhu Zhongdao, Counselor Zhu Guangmu, Secretary Chen Kangqi, Counselor Jiang Jiping, Secretary Yin Zhongrong, Counselor Xu Shijun, etc. (all are counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan), etc. More than 30 people. The social organizations include the Central Women's Movement Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society (see Annex 11 for details). Because the Executive Yuan's files do not have the original file for the purchase of cars, the files related to this case only contain reports on car brand numbers, letters from requesting agencies and private individuals, and the amount of distribution, etc. There is no original text of the decision, so how the distribution method is, which agencies should be allocated and which should not, how many agency heads should be allocated, and what conditions must private individuals and social organizations meet before they can be allocated are all unclear and unreasonable. As a result, there is no standard for distribution, and it is done arbitrarily. Some are allocated to various agencies, some are allocated to the heads of various agencies, some are allocated to private individuals and social organizations, and some are allocated to a few counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan. The cars allocated to various agencies are public property and are listed for handover. The cars allocated to the heads of agencies, if the head changes, whether they will be left for the successor to use has become a problem, and the cars allocated to private individuals or social organizations, and even a few counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan, are their private property, which is undoubtedly. Thinking that the Executive Yuan is not a government business organization, its purchased cars are of good quality and low price, only worth about 10 million yuan in legal currency, and the market price is more than 10 times higher than this. If all of them are allocated to various agencies for public use, no Chinese or foreign businessmen will have any complaints, but the Executive Yuan, in addition to allocating them to various agencies, actually allocates two-fifths of them to the heads of agencies, private individuals, social organizations, and counselors and secretaries, which is not in accordance with the law. The second case is that in June of this year, Xinsui Company requested the Executive Yuan to specially approve the import of 800 trucks. The Executive Yuan Secretariat sent a letter to the Temporary Management Committee for Importation and Exportation for verification. The committee replied on July 7th with Letter No. 4362: "Because the trucks are listed in the attached table (B) of goods that are temporarily suspended from import, the Jun Yuan has ordered the temporary suspension of import, and because Zhu Bing, the general manager of Xinsui Company, stated in his report on August 26th of this year: The price of the batch of vehicles, including freight, is approximately US$1,900, and the total price of 800 vehicles is approximately US$1.5 million. Please approve the sale by designated banks at the listed market price. The foreign exchange of the above-mentioned 800 vehicles, the Executive Yuan, because the company previously claimed to have its own foreign exchange, is now requesting to purchase foreign exchange, which is inconsistent. Therefore, it replied to the company and inquired: "Whether the payment for the 800 cars has been fully raised, please report truthfully for verification." On September 12th, it urgently telegraphed the Import and Export Management Committee to "temporarily suspend the issuance of permits and wait for further notice." (The original file is stored in the Executive Yuan.) So far, the special approval for the import of this batch of trucks is still pending. The government has prohibited the import of general cars before, and now it has specially approved the import of a large number of cars, and the credibility of the government's orders has been adversely affected. In the future, the Executive Yuan should pay attention to this type of fact. (See Annex 11 for details). According to regulations: Any private individual who goes abroad and returns to the country can bring back a used car as part of their luggage. The standard is that it has been used for more than half a year, the depreciated price is less than US$1,200, and it has a license plate. In the past year, there have been many people who have gone abroad and returned to the country, so this type of vehicle has been imported a total of 1,860 vehicles from the victory to the end of August of this year, and most of them are luxurious sedans, and some people have tried to use this to import and resell for profit. In the future, there should be more stringent crackdown measures, or a complete ban on the import of this type of vehicle. When the envoys and consuls of various countries come to China, they can bring cars for their own use, and a total of 174 vehicles were brought in by the end of August. During the War of Resistance and in the past two years, many American officers and soldiers who were rotated to China brought in many jeeps and trucks for military use. Some of them were transferred to agencies or individuals during their return to the country (no detailed number can be found). UNRRA and CNRRA included jeeps and trucks in their materials transported to China for relief transportation, and some were officially sold. Cars smuggled from Hong Kong to South China and Central China. The above eight points are the reasons for the proliferation of cars in Beijing, Shanghai and other places today. Regarding the purchase of trucks by merchants, the Executive Yuan and the Customs have implemented the suspension of imports as follows: On April 20th, 35, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 12554 of the Ministry of Economy: "Trucks ordered by merchants abroad are not allowed to be imported, except for those that are already on the way." The Customs implemented it with Announcement No. 51 on April 29th. On May 18th of the same year, the Executive Yuan issued an urgent telegram: "If trucks ordered abroad before April 29th have paid the full price in cash or by remittance and have submitted proof to the Customs, they will still be allowed to be imported." The Customs implemented it with Announcement No. 55 on May 23rd. Because foreign merchants protested against the above orders, the Inspector General of Customs requested instructions back and forth, and the Customs issued Announcement No. 80 on October 9th: "Those who ordered before April 29th and are already on the way before the date of this announcement are allowed to be imported with accommodation." (See Annex 12 for details). The above orders have been changed repeatedly. Although it is said to be for the sake of international trade customs, merchants are at a loss, and society is prone to misunderstandings. (Continued on Page 2 tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Edgar Allan Poe and His Works</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>A Tribute to Poe Ninety Years After His Death</p>
<p>Among the many well-known literary giants in the United States, Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most outstanding. Although his life was dissolute and impoverished, his works possess a remarkable style. His poems and novels are revered in world literature and have been translated into more than a dozen languages.</p>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were both itinerant actors, and they abandoned him before he was three years old. Subsequently, he was adopted by his uncle, John Allan, and became his foster son. He then added the surname "Allan" to his original name, Edgar Poe. Poe was intellectually gifted from a young age and studied in England and Richmond, Virginia. His uncle was a wealthy tobacco merchant in Richmond, with ample means to support this orphan. In 1826, he was sent to study at the University of Virginia, where his talent was highly appreciated by the professors, and he received honors in Latin and French.</p>
<p>He began writing poetry at the age of fifteen (1824), and at the university, he was already able to write good poetry. Unfortunately, he lived too dissolutely, often indulging in alcohol and gambling, to the point where he accumulated a gambling debt of 2,500 yuan at the end of the year. Although this debt was paid off by his uncle, he lost the opportunity to study. Later, he served in the military and at West Point Military Academy, but was eventually dismissed because he could not control his private life. In 1835, he went to Richmond to work as an assistant editor for the "Southern Literary Messenger," during which time he published many poems and novels in the journal, and his literary reputation soared.</p>
<p>He became a celebrity in Boston. In 1836, he married Miss Jing Leimeng, and their married life was extremely happy. However, his dissolute and unrestrained nature remained unchanged, and he eventually lost his job again. Thereafter, he and his wife traveled aimlessly until they settled in New York in 1844. He once started a newspaper, but it soon ceased publication due to financial difficulties. In 1847, his wife passed away, and he was enveloped in melancholy. Although he had once reformed his life, he eventually died due to dissolute living and excessive drinking. He died on October 7, 1849, at the age of only forty.</p>
<p>There are several editions of Poe's complete works, the more common of which is edited by Henry van Dyke, totaling ten volumes, including literary criticism, novels, and poetry. His novels can be divided into two types: one uses scientific and meticulous reasoning to solve detective cases, with representative works such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and "The Gold Bug"; the other is mysterious and imaginative, with representative works such as "William Wilson" and "The Fall of the House of Usher." Other famous novels include "Ligeia," "The Cask of Amontillado," "The Black Cat," "The Tell-Tale Heart," etc. The style of his novels has deeply influenced writers in Western European countries.</p>
<p>Poe's poetry is a precursor to later American poetry and has great value. Several French poets and novelists who were roughly contemporary with Poe, such as Baudelaire and Gautier, greatly admired his poetry. Baudelaire even regarded Poe's essay "The Poetic Principle" as the best theory of poetry. Later generations have criticized Baudelaire's masterpiece "Les Fleurs du Mal" as being deeply influenced by him. Poe's most famous poem is "The Raven," which represents his mysterious and profound style. Similar in style to "The Raven" are "The Bells," "The City in the Sea," and "The Sleepers." Poe also has a type of lyrical poetry that is praised by readers around the world, the most famous of which is "Annabel Lee." He also has pieces such as "To Helen," "Lenore," and "To One in Paradise." His literary criticism is also very rigorous and sharp, occupying a high position at the time.</p>
<p>Many different critics, domestic and foreign, contemporary and later generations, have unanimously recognized his creative talent. There is a passion and brilliance in his works, the source of which is contained in his love of feeling, love of color, and love of lively conditions. Although a few critics maliciously criticize his works as being too symbolic and decadent, his works will ultimately be transmitted with radiant splendor, remaining immortal. (Poe's portrait was published in this journal on June 18—Editor)</p>
<h3>Small Grass and Stone Blocks</h3>
<p>— Ge Shangde</p>
<p>Small Grass</p>
<p>In the evening, I happened to run to the veranda facing the street. A crescent moon floated above the distant rooftops, obscured by the clouds, letting the streetlights illuminate the entire veranda. After all, the season had already turned to early autumn. The evening breeze was gentle, and the light seemed to carry a hint of coolness.</p>
<p>My gaze leisurely moved around. The sparse pedestrians on the street below at night, the vague outlines of the distant buildings, and the scattered lights in the buildings gradually came into view. Then, I turned back to look at the white walls and the iron drainpipe hanging down from the third-floor roof against the wall. At this moment, a clump of small grass suddenly attracted my attention.</p>
<p>This clump of small grass grew in the joints of the drainpipe. It probably had no other source of nourishment other than the dirt blown up from the street and the dust washed down from the roof with the rain. However, it grew so vigorously, so lush, so charming, and so full of vigor.</p>
<p>No one would pay attention to such a miraculous existence, and of course, no one would give it pity or caress it. However, it has already passed through the spring and summer seasons. It has had a thriving life course, and it has also had a flourishing golden age. Accompanied by memories of the past, it probably does not feel lonely.</p>
<p>I gazed at this clump of small grass for a long, long time. Its green branches and leaves sparkled in the light of the street lamps. It seemed to be looking down on the drainpipe, the walls, everything around it, including me, who had originally wanted to generously give it a little pity.</p>
<p>I silently left the veranda.</p>
<p>Stone Blocks</p>
<p>Every time I walk through that alley, I always look closely at the stone blocks that make up the road surface.</p>
<p>They have been trampled on by countless people and vehicles: vendors, merchants, citizens, carriages, rickshaws, and cars. They have been worn down by cloth shoes, leather shoes, and wheels, becoming flat and smooth. This flatness and smoothness is a record of their long history.</p>
<p>However, they do not sigh. They also have countless glorious memories to provide them with intoxicating material. Many years ago, they were part of a magnificent mountain range. They stood on the summit, accompanied by the bright moon and the gentle breeze. Mountain waves played music for them, and floating clouds praised their firmness. They proudly looked up at the dome of the sky and proudly looked down at the earth. They were pure and aloof.</p>
<p>I don't know in what year or on what day they were hewn down by stonemasons, subjected to a series of dissections, and finally transported here to pave the road surface.</p>
<p>This does not detract from their past glory.</p>
<p>Moreover, they also have spiritual pleasure in being trampled on today. Every day, they use their tongues to carefully taste the breath of passers-by. They understand who should be cursed and who is worthy of praise. They have strong hatred and love. They take pleasure in curses and joy in singing praises.</p>
<p>I could not help but salute the stone blocks.</p>

This saying indicates the fierceness of the Tianjin people's mouths. It is said that like Sichuan people telling stories, if you want to ask a Tianjin person for a sentence, he can talk to you for three days and three nights, saying everything logically; in the end, he will still call you listen. Still confused.</p>
<p>Yaoqun is not very familiar with the situation in Tianjin. Yaoqun is just a lone goose in such a big Tianjin. Moreover, at this time in Tianjin, outside the urban area, there are still sporadic gunshots and plane bombings. The people in the city are panicked and can be said to be terrified. If a word is said incorrectly, it will be a terrible disaster. In this way, every "Wei mouth" has already sealed that "mouth," and where is there any willingness to leak half a word from the teeth? Yaoqun pondered slightly and thought of a way to start questioning.</p>
<p>"Annoying!" Yaoqun turned around and took two steps towards the house, saying these two words very loudly, looking at the two waiters sitting on the long bench in the hallway, as if talking to herself. This is the opening of an eight-legged essay. Immediately, she raised her eyebrows, and smiled slightly, nodding to the older waiter: "Excuse me, I have to trouble you to change the room for me!"</p>
<p>"Change the room?" This is the duty of the waiter, and he had to speak: "Let me tell you, young lady, your room is the best one on this bottom floor; it's big, bright, and ventilated, and it's good in every way. Besides, no room on the second or third floor is as cool as our bottom floor. In such hot weather, you..."</p>
<p>"It's okay if you don't change it. Or you can cancel the sign, just pretend that the room is unoccupied..." Yaoqun smiled innocently, "You know, I'm afraid someone will come to trouble me..."</p>
<p>"Cancel the sign?" The waiter shook his head early: "First, this is the rule of our small shop; when a room is vacated, it must be signed. Second, if there is no sign, and someone else comes and specifies this room, do we check in or not? ...... Miss, you are educated and reasonable, aren't you? ...... Besides, being afraid of trouble is your own business; if you want to pay attention, pay attention; if you don't want to pay attention, don't pay attention! ......"</p>
<p>"No way!" Yaoqun seized this sentence: "Pay attention or not? Like this lady who just called something something, she must be something from your store...something... Yaoqun intends to accuse him of injustice.</p>
<p>"Her? ...... Humph! ...... Are you talking about that woman in the Si clothing just now, that thing that looks three parts human and seven parts ghost? ...... She has nothing to do with the small shop, but you have to deal with it, you have to pay attention!" This waiter may not be from Tianjin? But he seems to be straightforward.</p>
<p>"Why?" Yaoqun was unwilling to nag and just asked this question in a provocative manner, saving himself from interrupting his interest.</p>
<p>"She is a surveyor for the Japanese..."</p>
<p>"Bah, surveyor, she is her mother's detective dog! ......" This person's voice was even louder. He supplemented this sentence from the side; the three words "detective maniac" were also spit out from the teeth with hatred. This is the second waiter. While saying that, he nodded vigorously to Yaoqun, adding to his words.</p>
<p>This person's addition gave Yaoqun a big surprise, not just a big surprise, but also a trace of astonishment, and not just astonishment, astonishment also mixed with joy, happiness; this joy and happiness seemed to be a little over the top, unconsciously invading a nameless feeling, almost moved to tears.</p>
<h3>Smoke</h3>
<p>— Qian Jinxi</p>
<p>When the waterfowl feels the warmth of the river flow, the hospitable youth has become contemplative, listening intently to the weeping sound of the water clock in front of the lamp. What is that shining grain of sand in the sea? Even if there are newly sprouted tender branches in the flower garden, he misses an ancient statue. In that city, that imprisoned person has crossed countless turbulent waves and countless dangerous passes. When the dream is over, there are still brilliant afterdreams. When the smoke dissipates, it also takes away the truth. Therefore, in the chapel, the youth is still confused by the joys and sorrows of human life. Is that God's will? He doesn't believe it.</p>

<h3>Hiroshima—Is it a City of Peace?</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Translator's Note: The American Life magazine published this article about Japanese cities in its September issue, which is enough to illustrate how Japan is seeking revival after the war, and how American capitalists are helping them. Is it worth our consideration? August 6, two years ago, was the day when the first atomic bomb in history was officially used in war. Its power destroyed the entire Hiroshima. In addition to expressing deep condolences to the residents of Hiroshima, the Japanese could only feel surprised.</p>
<p>Now, a legendary story is unfolding in Hiroshima. The Japanese believe that it will become a new world of peace. They planted a camphor tree here. According to Japanese customs, this is a symbol of longevity. They pray for it day and night. The neat streets show that Hiroshima has been resurrected from death. The Japanese people intend to move this once-destroyed city back to the map. Their slogan is: "Forget the past war and look at our future!"</p>
<p>If a walking metaphor is used, then Hiroshima's revival should be an astonishing "strutting." Hiroshima, which had once been sharply reduced from 250,000 people to 175,000, has gradually increased to 210,000 people. 60,000 houses were destroyed in the war, replaced by 23,000 new buildings. The opening of shops has helped Hiroshima's prosperity. Although everything has not yet reached the pre-war level, however, in just two years, to build a new city on a ruined land, this spirit is admired even by Americans. Listen to what an American general stationed in Hiroshima said: "We don't know what the real driving force is that makes them work so excitedly. All I know are the residents of Hiroshima. Perhaps they need peace..."</p>
<p>Indeed, the people of Hiroshima today are working hard. They have a great ideal—the common goal of all the people in the city is to completely restore the shattered Hiroshima in a peaceful celebration day. They do not want to create a "Utopian Hiroshima in an ideal paradise," however, they want to do their best to form it into the most beautiful land, a Japanese fortress.</p>
<p>All kinds of renovations in Hiroshima are completely done in the American style. The streets, shop fronts, high-rise buildings, everything is similar to American cities. Regarding these, the Americans are very willing to invest gold dollars here and join hands with the Japanese to build a new Hiroshima.</p>
<p>This year's "Hiroshima Day" (August 6), Hiroshima held a grand and simple ceremony. The mayor personally planted soil under the camphor tree, and a wooden sign was hung high on the tree, with the inscription: "Tree of Peace Peace treein menorial." At the moment when the atomic bomb exploded two years ago, the entire Hiroshima was filled with memorial bells, and Japanese old women wiped their tears and mourned their children. Students of senior girls' schools, wearing neat navy blue and white uniforms, chanted "Ode to Peace" in a low voice. Children performed a bamboo spear military parade (bamboo is a sign of extremely rapid growth). Japanese mothers firmly believe that their children will grow like bamboo. Other students sold commemorative badges to raise funds for war orphans.</p>
<p>The people of Hiroshima have been fully mobilized, and Hiroshima is progressing by leaps and bounds. What do the Chinese people, who consider themselves "victors," think?</p>
<h3>"Sleeping in a Painting" and "Painting a Bedroom"</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>"Zai Yu slept during the day. Confucius said: 'Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dung and earth cannot be troweled. What is the use of scolding Yu!'" - *The Analects*</p>
<p>Zai Yu took a nap during the day and received a scolding from Confucius! He was scolded as "rotten wood"; scolded as a "wall of dung and earth," and finally, hit with a stern sentence: "What is the use of scolding Yu!" Isn't that a bit too much? It is normal for people to doze off when the days are long and they feel tired. Why did the Master get so angry, exceeding the boundaries of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, all expressed in moderation? It's truly incomprehensible! To insist on being like the Master, always restless, without time to warm the seat, sitting upright with a solemn air, being strict enough, how can the body endure it? To use modern terminology, he just didn't understand the art of living! The affectation of sages is not as comfortable and unrestrained as the free and easy nature of hermits and recluses. Tao Yuanming said, "Lying high by the north window, a cool breeze suddenly arrives, I think of myself as a person of the ancient Xi Huang era." And "I am drunk and want to sleep; you may leave." What a noble sentiment! It truly makes one want to prostrate in admiration! Xunzi said, "Human nature is inherently evil; goodness is artificial." I also want to say, "Human nature is inherently inclined to ease and averse to labor; those who force themselves to be tense and solemn are being artificial." My saying this is not to advocate idleness and indulgence, but to say that one should be solemn when it is time to be solemn, and leisurely when it is time to be leisurely. That is, as Westerners say, work when it is time to work, and rest when it is time to rest. For example, if Zai Yu takes a nap, his body gets rest, and he should feel refreshed in spirit. When he picks up a book, he will surely have more energy! Confucius, however, did not understand this principle and insisted on implementing a "fatigue bombing" style of reading and writing. This not only goes against educational principles but also greatly hurts Zai Yu's self-esteem! No matter from what point of view, it is excessive.</p>
<p>Because of this, a friend once told me that there was an error in the original text of this passage. He said that the "畫" (huà, draw/paint) in Zai Yu's "畫寢" (huà qǐn, sleeping in a painting) should be "畫" (huà, to delineate/plan). Even if Confucius was a sage, he never scolded people. Even if he had to reprimand someone, it would be appropriate, neither biased nor excessive, neither too much nor too little. How could there be such an inappropriate and absurd scolding? As for how to interpret "畫寢" (huà qǐn), one can derive meaning from the text. Perhaps Zai Yu loved art and had some artistic talent and a strong interest! He wanted to decorate the walls of his bedroom, but I don't know what kind of tools he used to draw on the walls. It was just that Zai Yu's dormitory was not rich and magnificent! The walls and beams were only simple and crude, not far from Yan Yuan's humble lane. Therefore, Confucius saw no need for drawing and decoration. But the ambitious Zai Yu insisted on drawing a lot on it, so the Master saw it and taught him: Rotten wood is not good for carving, and the walls of dung and earth cannot be painted. In other words, the Master meant that there is no need to decorate a thatched cottage with embroidered balls, that is, everything should be appropriate and proportionate. Such an explanation is perhaps somewhat speculative, far-fetched, and contrived? But please forgive me for not being able to verify it. I will tentatively offer my opinion. However, I somewhat agree with the idea that "畫" (huà, draw/paint) should be "畫" (huà, to delineate/plan). Because this can exonerate and defend the sages, and it is the only wonderful method to complete the entire personality of the sages. Otherwise, we cannot help but harbor doubts and reservations about Confucius. Even regarding this midday nap incident, thousands of years later, we still have to stand up for Zai Yu and protest to the Master, asking him to make corrections.</p>
<h3>Human Emotion</h3>
<p>— Yuan Sheng</p>
<p>There is always a force of steam rising upwards in a thermos bottle. If the stopper is not tight, it will "sigh" and jump out, releasing some of the pressure and relieving some of the force. If the stopper is too tight, the whole bottle may explode. If there is no stopper, the heat will escape, turning into cold water, and it will no longer be a thermos bottle.</p>
<p>The whole person is like a thermos bottle. The seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire—are a powerful force that makes people lively and energetic. Each person's ability to suppress these emotions is like the stopper. If the ability to suppress is weaker, expressing some emotions is fine. If the ability to suppress is too strong, emotions cannot be released and can only turn inward, attacking the heart. Then, there is a problem with the body. If there is no suppression, emotions are excessively expressed, and one will inevitably suffer unexpected blows, such as illness and disappointment. In the end, one becomes disillusioned, without any emotions, becoming a cold-blooded animal, and of course, cannot be called a person.</p>
<p>Therefore, the thermos bottle can also teach us a lesson.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America's View of Marriage</p>
<p>American men and women take marriage very lightly. When feelings are good, they can get married immediately. When feelings disappear, they can get divorced immediately. Women all have the ability to be independent. Divorce does not require alimony. Everything in the world is constantly changing. The union of men and women cannot guarantee that it will not change. Thinking it through thoroughly, naturally, marriage and divorce are seen as insignificant. Then, society will not have so many family tragedies, such as taking concubines and abandoning wives, etc. On the contrary, the United States will never have such a performance. If husband and wife disagree, they apply to the court for divorce, and tomorrow they each find their own lover. In our view, it seems like a family is being torn apart, but in reality, it is solving a miserable family where people sleep in the same bed but have different dreams and forming a happy and loving family. This is beneficial to society in every way. American women take personal freedom very seriously. If her husband pulls out even one hair, she immediately files a lawsuit. Only in this way can the rule of male dominance be overthrown. Why should a woman be subjugated to a man? American women put personal freedom before marriage. If there is no freedom, she can give up her husband and find another way out. She does not completely depend on her husband for life, so why should she be controlled by him? Miss America views getting married as moving house, even cheaper than moving house. There are countless cases of getting married in the morning and divorced in the evening. This method is certainly not to be emulated, but the old ideas of "remaining faithful to one husband until death" and "a woman not serving two husbands" have buried the lifelong happiness of many good women. One day, mankind will break free from the shackles of marriage and throw matchmakers into a corner. At that time, the "three aunts and six grannies" will lose their jobs, and matchmaking agencies will also lose business. The mayor can have one less wedding to officiate and devote his energy to reforming the city. Formal dress merchants will no longer be able to exploit the newlyweds for rental fees. One can also save tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding certificate. Wedding photos, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to take, are also a waste. Miss America spends much less money in these areas than Chinese brides.</p>

<p>Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road: No Need to Change to One-Way Traffic; Reply from the Police Bureau's Administrative Department</p>
<p>Received your letter of September 10, relaying a letter from reader Mr. Zhang Zixian, stating that "Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road are narrow, and stalls are lined up all day long. There are many banks and money houses in the area, and there are many vehicles coming and going, often causing congestion. It seems that they should be changed to one-way streets to facilitate traffic." We thank you deeply for your concern for municipal affairs. However, after investigation, the roads that run across Ningbo and Tianjin Roads are all major arteries for north-south traffic, with very heavy traffic. Therefore, the intersections of Ningbo and Tianjin Roads are often congested. This is the reason why traffic cannot flow smoothly. As for the proposal to change to one-way traffic, it does not seem necessary. In addition to instructing the Huangpu Branch Bureau to pay attention to guiding the vendors and diverting traffic at any time, we hereby reply to you. Please take note of this. Addressed to: Social Service Department, Shen Bao Newspaper; From: Administrative Police Department, Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau</p>

<h3>The Queen of the Netherlands Announces Her Abdication</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>On the Lotingde Street in The Hague, there is often a short, plump old woman wearing a worn-out hat, riding a bicycle through the crowd. When she arrives at the palace, she enters the gate, gets off her bicycle, and a guard runs over to support her. She waves her hand and puts the bicycle on the rack herself.</p>
<p>She is one of the longest-reigning monarchs in the few remaining monarchical countries in modern Europe, Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Marie - "The Victoria of the Netherlands."</p>
<p>Queen Wilhelmina is sixty-seven years old this year and has presided over the affairs of the Netherlands for forty-nine years. According to a Reuters dispatch, she is preparing to abdicate in favor of her daughter, Princess Juliana. After the joint meeting of the two houses of Parliament passes the resolution, Princess Juliana will succeed her. The Queen's motivation for abdication was actually proposed ten years ago. But at that time, the situation in Europe was critical. The Nazi army under Hitler's leadership attempted to annex the Netherlands. Although the Netherlands was small and weak, it was not willing to succumb. Therefore, this stubborn old woman has persevered for ten years.</p>
<p>The Queen's stubborn personality had already developed in childhood. There is a famous legend in history:</p>
<p>When the former King William III of the Netherlands died, the Queen acceded to the throne at a young age, being just a ten-year-old girl (later she was crowned at the age of eighteen). At that time, her mother, the Queen Dowager, acted as regent and strictly controlled the Queen. But one day, after being excessively scolded by her mother, the girl finally lost her temper: "I will stand on the balcony of the palace and announce to the people of the country how you mistreat me!" This forced her mother to soften. This anecdote has spread throughout the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In 1918, when the German Emperor Wilhelm was defeated and fled to the Netherlands, the Queen sheltered him, which was met with dissatisfaction from various parties. British Prime Minister Lloyd George demanded that the German Emperor be extradited to London for trial, but she coldly replied, "You are too naive!" This shocked the British court.</p>
<p>Here is another example: Ten years ago, when her daughter Juliana - who will soon become the new Queen of the Netherlands - married Prince Bernhard of Germany, she forbade the hanging of the swastika flag in the hall. When Hitler found out, he was furious. She wrote to the dictator saying, "This is my daughter and her lover getting married, not the Netherlands and Germany getting married."</p>
<p>She has a strong and stubborn will, which has made everything in the Netherlands seem peaceful and good under the rule of a woman. The Second European War forced her to flee the Hague Palace in a hurry. Nazi partisans hunted her down and plotted to assassinate her. On the ship to England, she and Princess Juliana were almost killed by German naval mines. However, she finally arrived in London and formed a government-in-exile.</p>
<p>The Queen married Prince Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin of Germany when she was twenty years old. After the marriage, Prince Henry was subjected to many restrictions. He was given only an empty title of "President of the Netherlands Red Cross," and Parliament refused to grant him the title of "Prince of the Netherlands" or approve any salary for him. He also knew that resistance was useless and could only amuse himself by hunting and traveling. During the First World War, because he was German, the Queen ordered the police to closely monitor him. It is not known what happened to this unlucky husband now.</p>
<p>Princess Juliana was born in 1909. In view of the restrictions she herself had suffered in her childhood, the Queen specially allowed her to receive a new education, teaching her to go to public schools and be treated the same as other students. The princess was clever and loved music and sports. She met Bernhard in Paris. He was two years younger than Juliana, very poor, and worked for a German paint company in Paris. But they immediately fell in love and announced their marriage on January 7, 1937.</p>
<p>On the wedding day, Queen Wilhelmina broadcast a message saying, "Although Bernhard is only twenty-five years old, he is indeed a very hardworking worker." After the marriage, Bernhard announced that he had severed ties with the German National Socialist Party, and in spirit and soul, he was a Dutchman.</p>
<p>When the Princess and Bernhard were honeymooning on the French Riviera, they drank cocktails at a Sunday dinner (which was absolutely forbidden under the Queen's rules). A reporter from a Dutch newspaper disclosed this in the newspaper, and the Queen was furious. She immediately summoned them back to the country and confined them in Soestdyk Palace. A few months later, the princess became pregnant, and she gave birth to a girl the following January. - If the Dutch monarchy does not change, it is very likely that this girl will be the third Queen of the Netherlands in twenty years.</p>
