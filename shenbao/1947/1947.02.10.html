<h3>魯南臨沂指日可下　入新泰國軍向蒙陰推進　豫東太康收復寗陸激戰</h3>

<p>〔本報徐州八日電〕魯南國軍八日進抵臨沂近郊。又共軍萬餘人七日向郯城東南地區竄犯，圖迂迴至國軍側背騷擾，廢國軍與郝鵬舉部已將其包圍於石寨·竹墩及歡敦埠以西地區，正痛擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州九日電〕竄被白塔埠及歡敦埠以南地區之共軍萬餘人，現已被國軍層層包圍，共軍日來僅亡慘重，即可一彭殞滅。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南九日電〕國軍王耀武部之　練成軍，八日收復新泰穢，即續向魯共補給最大基地之蒙陰繼續前進，該城共軍已呈動搖，前日以來，正將兵工廠及糧彈倉庫等紛向沂水·泗水搬運，沂泗道上牛馬車排列如長蛇陣。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南八日電〕兩日來國軍三路由萊蕪向新泰進兵，與共軍解四師廖容標及警一旅劉國柱部在山地激職甚烈，迄八日晨中路抵距新泰十五公里之蒙陰寨，東路在歷山以南，西路在黃楊山南對戰，迄八日下午七時國軍進駐新泰，共軍萬餘向南潰退。境之山區，整頓補充。又共軍新八團千餘人，七日夜竄單縣，碭山邊境之朱集滋擾。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州八日電〕竄犯商邱小壩地區之共軍劉伯誠部第二·三·四·六等縱隊，經國軍逋日在劉口集·張莊·楚寨包圍痛擊，損失慘重，現共軍已喪失作戰力，其殘部近日化整為零，沿商邱東西之隴海邊綫流竄，窟隙破路，國軍正分別驅逐中·又徐州·商邱間客貨車均暢通。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州九日電〕豫東共軍劉伯誠之殘部，日為分為若干小股，窺隙流竄，八日晨一時許又將小壩柳河間之隴海路破壞廿餘里，刻國軍正掩護搶修中。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州九日電〕太　八日經國軍收復，共軍向北靈去。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州九日電〕九日晨有共軍七百，由豐縣以西之終興集南竄，圖向我周塞進犯，刻於周寨附近被國軍圍擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南九日電〕魯南共軍集中四師，匯力攻隴海路東段以北郝鵬舉部，東海西北之沙河鎭，已被共軍攻陷。共軍有自此再度切斷隴海東段，回竄蘇北企圖，國軍正堵截中。</p>
<h3>某軍事觀察家談戰局　魯南已入新階段</h3>
<p>共軍圖越津浦路與劉伯誠部會合</p>
<p>〔本報濟南九日電〕自魯中王耀武部大軍收復新棗後，魯南全局已進人一新階段。據某權威軍事觀察家談：在包圍圈中之骨南共軍，原可作下列五種行動，（一）逃避山地，（二）死守臨沂，（三）退竄膠東，（四）穿越津浦路，與劉伯誠部合流，（五）回竄蘇北。其中原以第一項可能為最大，惟自北路國軍進佔萊一無，新泰，突入魯共山區心臟後，其保存實力逃避山區之企圖，顯已消滅。然自日來共軍集中主力向隴海東段郝鵬舉部猛攻觀之，共軍似在一方藉此報復郝部背叛之仇，一方亦以郝部為國軍全綫較弱一環，故其進攻顯係企圖突破包園，回竄蘇北，再劉伯誠股自兩側北可再行鉗攻徐州，南亦仍可威脅京滬，惟國軍對此已予嚴防，共軍詭計絕不得逞，如此共軍之第五企圖亦成泡影。共軍戰略原則，向係保存實力，避免決戰，故死守臨沂之希望亦甚少，至退竄膠東則正如老鼠鑽入牛角，雖可稍安於一時，然非萬不得已，共軍決不出此。故據目下情勢判斷，自以採第四着穿越津浦與劉伯誠合流希望為最大。某觀察家末笑謂，邇來各地消息稱國軍克復臨沂，此種過分誇張宣染，實不必要，蓋國軍當前最大目的，乃在設法捕捉共軍主力，一舉而殲滅之，始能策長治久安之局，不然即令收復臨沂，打通津浦路，共軍主力存在，依然不能解決問題也。</p>
<h3>共軍援毫受創　回竄鹿邑柘城</h3>

<h3>主席宴王雲五　垂詢國內經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕主席九日下午七時，召宴王雲五等，即席乘詢當前國內經濟情况，並有所指示。</p>

<p>〔本報潘陽九日電〕大連來人談，大連有大兵工廠兩處，製造步槍，輕重機關槍，迫擊砲，及槍砲彈等，一由蘇軍控制，一由共軍控制，因而大連僅為遼南一帶共軍補給藝地，亦為膠東及魯南共軍械揮策源地。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕根據憲法所擬定之五院組織法草案初稿，大體上與目前各院組織法無大出人，立院仍將說院長·副院長各一人，由立委互選之，立委人數將自目前之九十九名增至八百名左右，由各省市邊省僑胞及職業團體選出之，任期三年，連選連任，立院委會，因立委增多，工作加重，原擬由五個增至十四個，後因經濟·勞資·民刑法等委會其工作可併入其他委會，最後決定設財政·國防·外交·農林·預算·交通·廳郵電·敎育·法制等十個委會，其組織由法律定之，考試院現僅有銓叙部，考選委會等兩個機構，聞將來將增設一公務員保障委會，以確定文官制度。又根據憲法，考試院設考試委員若干人，因之，考選委會是否繼續存在，尙不一定。此外，憲法又規定，以後公務員之選拔，應實行公開競爭之考試制度，非經考試及精者”不得任用、考試院業務旣擴大，其在各地之機構，勢必亦須擴大。行政院組織法，與去冬國防委會所通過者無大歧異。司法行政部仍隸行政院，監察院組織法草擬時，本有人建蠶變更各地監察使署組織及職掌，聞最後仍維原狀。</p>
<h3>國大區域代表　根據憲法生者　將達二千一百人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕據權威力估計，將來根據憲法所以產生之區域國大代表，其數目將達二千一百人。至職業團體代表與婦女代表名額，究應如何規定，此次所擬議之國大代表選舉法初稿，未作最後決定。職業團體前曾建議，職業代表比例增加，果爾則總額恐近二千人，據洪蘭友估計，國大會堂最多僅能容納二千七百人，因之，下屆國大開會時，會址恐將成問題。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨在政府改組時，已決定參加立法監察兩院，人選尙未作具體決定，但短時內必可商妥。赴京之代表團人選，亦將於日內決定，可能由張君動氏親自率領晋京。據某負責人表示；民社黨之參放政府，有兩項指導原則：一爲如何結束訓政，二爲縮小政府與中共間之鴻溝，最後造成全國各黨派之合作團結。目前第二點明顯地難於做到，故此時之參加立法監察兩院，目的在完成行憲。至於國府委員會及政院均不擬參加，以便仍以在野黨之身份，促進中國之民主與憲政。民社黨將來對於地方之選舉，將熱烈參加。又此次參加政府之方式，乃折衷黨內各種不同意見而決定者，相信不致爲北方黨員所反對。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府改組，日形具體，記者今日訪民盟某氏，探詢對此問題之看法，歸納其意見如下：（一）目前之改組政府方式，不能終止國內之軍事衝突，與國事無補，中共與民盟均不致參加。（二）以對外之意義而言，美國目前所關切者，爲中國能恢復和平，以便於其資本及商品之輸出，今改組政府不能達到此項目的，故五億貸款是否因此而成功，殊有問題，但在另一方面，中國之經濟崩潰亦非美國之利益，故政府改組之後，可能有經濟援助，但不會十分痛快。（三）就對內之意義言，問題在政府之政策是否有革新，是否有提高行政效能之決心。在野各黨之人員，在素質上未必優於政府現職人員。在現實政治情形之下，各黨派及社會賢達參加政府後，是吾能發揮監好之作用，亦頗有問題。</p>

<h3>日臨時賠償辦法　十三種工業設備先拆遷　我國希望獲總噸數之半</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據南京方面可靠消息：遠東委員會之賠償委員會，對於日本臨時賠償辦法，已指定十三種軍事性工業設備，先期拆遷：（一）火力發電廠，（二）鋼鐵廠，（三）造船廠，（四）飛機製造廠，（五）海陸兵工廠，（六）酸廠，（七）　廠，（八）鋼珠軸承廠，（九）工具機製造廠，（十）輕金屬廠（鋁工業），（十一）民營兵工廠，（十二）人造石汕廠，（十三）人造橡皮廠。據日政府估計，以上工業設備總噸位爲一千二百萬噸，因種類繁多，賠償委員會尙不能決定每國應得之分配量。美國政府正攷慮，依各盟國實際需要，擬就臨時賠償範圍內，先提出一部分分與各豐國。先期分配數量，美方有主張應爲臨時賠債總額百分之二十五者，亦有主張百分之二十者；豐國間有主張百分之三十者。截至目前止，尙未確定。我國政府以國內工業亟待恢復，曾依據實際需要，向美方交涉，希望在先期拆遷總數額中，取得半數，但尙無結果。</p>
<p>我行政院所設之賠償委員會下，分設六小組：（一）工具機組，（二）造船組，（三）鋼鐵組，（四）化工組，（五）火力發電組，（六）輕金屬組，分別擬具拆遷計劃，但因建廠費用龐大，刻正就財政能力可能範圍內，攷慮分年建設計劃，俾與拆遷工廠配合利用。關於先期拆遷部分，駐日盟軍總部，最近屢邀我國參觀工具機及火力發電廠，以便選擇，並以工具機二萬五千部，火力發電廠十二所供我參觀，參觀日期，或將在本月十五左右云。</p>

<h3>社論　從裁軍問題看美蘇關係</h3>
<p>馬歇爾國務卿於七日舉行其就職後第一次記者招待會，席間暢談美國對於裁减軍備問題所採取之立塲，其要點凡五：（一）吾人所企求之目標，厥爲確保和平，俾爲集體安全奠定鞏固基礎；（二）國際管制原子能以及其他有效之保障，至爲重要，原子能若不加以管制，則人類卽無安全可言，吾人特別重視此項問題之解決，其原因亦卽在此；（三）在歐洲及遠東和平解決之前，任何眞正裁减軍備，均難望實現；卽使任何實際裁减軍備，亦不可能；美國政府將設法避免一九二一年後由片面裁减軍備及限制軍備所造成之悲劇，不致重演；（四）在集體安全制確立之前，美國決不裁减軍隊；（五）美國若不實施義務兵役制，則將無法以其必要之軍事力量，爲美國外交政策之後盾。</p>
<p>由此可知，馬歇爾國務卿是完全贊成奧斯汀於四日向安全理事會所提出的裁軍方案的。我們翻閱美國建議的全文，綜合起來，要點不外乎下列三項：（一）設立裁軍委員會，由安全理事會全體理事國組織之，其任務乃在向安全理事會提出關於管制並裁减軍備與軍隊之實施措置，包括有效保隙之方法在內；但有若干問題，依照聯合國大會於去年一月二十四日及十二月十四日所通過之議案應由原子能委員會管轄者，當不在裁軍委員會的任務範圍之內。（二）設立一安全委員會，在裁軍委員會職務之範圍內，向安全理事會提出建議，允應決定裁軍委員會，軍事參謀委員會。曁原子能委員會間之相互關係。（三）安全理事會下决開會時，應卽開始審議原子能委員會於去年一月三十一日所提出之第一次報吿書，允應注意報吿書中第三章所提出之各項建議。</p>
<p>這一個裁軍新方案，在現行國際環境之下，的確値得稱道的。常時我國出席安全理事會代表郭泰祺博士首先表示贊同，並謂美國方案，『特別着重國際管制原子能問題，且主張優先討論原子能問題，中國代表團將以全力爲其後盾。』就是，和美國站在相反的立塲之蘇聯代表，對於美國代表建議設立裁軍委員會，在原則上也不能不表示同意，但是葛羅米柯對美國建議的三點：一卽爲奧斯汀所謂原子能必須交付國際管制，並須採取監察制，以作爲有效的保障，對於違反協定之任何國家，均應予以集體制裁。二卽爲美國限制裁軍委員會之職務範圍，不得干涉原子能委員會所管轄的範圍；三卽爲美國主張先行討論原子能間題，然後再討論裁軍備問題。蘇聯代表對於這三點均表示異議。美蘇雙方各執一詞，均不肯讓步，幾乎使裁軍問題陷於僵局，無法再進行討論。</p>
<p>因此素以調人自居的法國代表，便挺身而出，排難解紛，企圖調和美蘇雙方的意見，使安全理事會對於裁軍問題早日成立協議，不致再引起美蘇兩國間的磨擦，法國代表繆維爾稍試其外交手腕，居然立卽奏效，使美蘇雙方均同意將法國代表於一月九日所提出的草案作爲討論的基礎；蘇聯代表忽採妥協態度，頓使裁軍問題火可樂觀。至於法國草案的內容，要點有二：（一）設立一裁軍委員會，於三個月內提出建議，以實行聯合國大會對於裁减及限制軍備所通過之決議案；（二）安全理事會應儘速審議國際管制原子能計劃。這個草案的最大特色，乃在折衷至當，使美蘇雙方均能接受，作爲繼續討論的基礎。後經六國小組委員會討論，蘇聯代表立卽表示同意三點：（二）立卽設立裁軍委員會，開始起草普遍裁减軍備之計劃；（二）立卽討論國際管制原子能問題；（三）從速組織國際軍隊。</p>
<p>本來這樣，美蘇對於裁减軍備問題所造成的僵局，就可以打開了；但是美國代表奧斯汀仍堅持着，草案中應規定一項保證，就是裁軍委員會不得侵入原子能委員會的活動範圍內。同時蘇聯代表葛羅米柯也不甘示弱表示堅決反對，因此事敗垂成，裁軍問題陷於僵局，也就無從打開，使美蘇諒解合作的前途，又蒙上了一層陰影。奧斯汀爲打開現行僵局起見，乃在會外與蘇聯代表葛羅米柯直接進行談判，但其結果，因爲雙方意見鑿枘如故，奧斯汀的努力又告失敗。同時六國代表也束手無策，祗好決定將美蘇雙方的意見，一併提交安全理事會於本星期三開會討論了。</p>
<p>美蘇對於裁軍問題的意見不一致，終未能成立協議，不論對於美蘇兩國的關係，或對於整個世界和平，都是一件令人失望的事情，尤其是我們一般渴望國際合作共同維持世界和平的人民，看到去年十二月紐約四國外長會議及聯合國大會第二屆大會相機圓滿閉幕的情形，莫不喜形於色、，而滿以爲國際局勢今後必能漸趨於明朗，不僅英美與蘇聯之間的關係，可望逐漸好轉。而且戰後眞正的世界和平，也可於本年得以實現，故對於下月莫斯科四國外長會議，莫不抱着滿腔的熱望；殊不料在外長會議開幕之前夕，美蘇兩國討論裁軍問題，仿未能以互忍互讓的精神，謀得此一問題的澈底解決，從此看來，美蘇關係好轉的可能性，仍不能言之過甚。</p>
<p>現在，這個世界安危所繫的裁軍問題，又將由安全理事會公開討論了。我們當然希望美蘇雙方，均能秉有互忍互讓的精神，大家平心靜氣來討論這個問題，據聯合社八日華府電，美國現正小心翼翼，設法避免因裁軍問題而與蘇聯在安全理事會中「攤牌」，足見美國已準備讓步了；此在蘇聯，雖然迄無妥協約表示，但是裁軍問題係蘇聯外長莫洛托夫首先提出的，自不致堅持成見，聽任此一問題長此陷於僵局的。</p>

<h3>五國和約今日簽字　義大利擬要求保留修正權　錢泰大使代表我國簽署對義和約</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕據政府方面消息：對養和約定十日在巴黎簽訂，外部已訓令駐法大使錢泰代表簽字。又訊，據外交界息，義政府　對和約雖已決定簽訂，但因其要求未被四強外長接受，故曾向四外長聲明保留將來以雙邊條約之形式要求修改之權。日前義駐華大使並曾奉義政府之命，將前項致四外長之聲明，面陳我王外長。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕頃悉對義，羅，匈，保，芬五國和的簽字典禮，定於明日在法國外交部舉行，將向國家博物院借用法王路易十五世，及十六世御用寫字檯，作爲簽字之用。按此一寫字檯，在法國一七九三年至一七九五年革命時期，曾爲當時之革命政府，即公共安全委員會所使用</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕五前敵國和的定明日舉行簽字儀式，似尙有若干一般人所關切之問題，未曾獲得肯定答案。整個巴黎在問：「南斯拉夫是否將加入他國簽字於各和的？」常南外長西密樞自貝爾格勒啓程來此之時，南政府之公報曾謂，西氏此行任務在簽署匈，保，羅三國和的，對於義大利和的竟未提及。西氏昨抵巴黎時，對此事亦不願發表聲明。另一令人關切之事，即爲昨日公布之四强決議，在簽字儀式中不許前敵國提出口頭或書面聲明之一點，一般皆知五前敵國屆時均準備發表聲明。此五國對四强決議，目前尙無表示，但料彼等若不獲於簽字時發表意見，或將有抗議之表示。芬羅保三國代表團已於昨夜抵巴黎，義匈兩國代表尙未抵達，今夜或均能趕到。巴黎之空氣猶如去夏召開廿一國和平會議時之景象。</p>
<h3>對德和約起草程序　美代表提出計劃　白俄羅斯要求德巨額賠款　四強同意結束奧佔領原則</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕白俄羅斯代表今日向四外次會議陳述意見，要求自德國取得價値十五億美元之賠款。魯爾區應交由蘇聯參加管制，</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦八日專電〕四外决會議，本日在原則上同意對奧和的生效時，結束奧國之佔領，當局並於和的生效以後九十日內撤退明國駐軍。關於奧戰俘遣送問題，決定交回軍委會處理。</p>
<h3>希政治犯　處決問題</h3>
<p>安理會今開會討論</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖九日電〕安理會於明晨召開之特別會議，將討論被判死刑之希臘遊擊隊員之問題。聯合國之調査團已請示安理會，是否得代希北部被判死刑之遊擊隊員六名出面干涉。希政府雖已下令暫綏執行死刑，然同時則訓示其駐紐約之代表，反對調査團之十涉。然星期五來電則謂，已有遊擊隊員三名，因延期執行令到達太遲，已被處決。而紐約可靠方面則謂，希政府之延期執行令，於星期五午夜即到期，故全部人犯均已處決。英國之意見乃爲調査團之活動範圍，旣不僅希臘一國，尙有保·南，及阿爾巴尼亞等三國，故如欲干涉，必須及於四國，不可僅以希臘爲限。一般預料若安理會決定干涉，恐將促成希臘政府之危機。</p>
<h3>希臘採取戒備　預防左派活動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典八日電〕希臘陸軍衛戌司令部及當地警察局，今日命令其所屬軍警全部戒備，準備應付希臘左派陣綫傳將於星期日舉行之非法示威運動。警察及陸軍當局均謂，計劃中之反政府民衆大會，不致在此間或巴特拉斯或薩朗尼加舉行。</p>
<h3>美國重視　貿易政策</h3>
<p>國會政府意見不一致</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美國參衆兩院共和黨領袖今日表示彼等或將對於一項重大外交政策，分道揚鑣，即國務院有權减低關稅而不與國會諮商一項政策。共和黨各主要參議員雖欲採取折衷辦法，以防互惠貿易協定法案之立即廢止，但共和黨各主要衆議員則命將此計劃全盤檢討。共和黨衆院預算委會主席宣布，該會將於本月廿四日舉行秘密會議，開始聽取各方意見，此舉障示不贊成</p>
<p>折衷辦法</p>
<p>聞折衷辦法係得國務院高級人員之贊同，規定在對各國之協定中，列入補充條文，並規室關稅之裁定權屬諸總統，藉以保護美國經濟。準此，則保持最後權力者爲總統而非國會，一部份衆議員即反對此點。互惠貿易計劃，旨在樹立世界貿易，准許國務院儘量减低關稅以百分之五十爲度，以報答採取同樣讓步之其他國家。據共和黨參議員范登堡之左右稱，范氏認爲共和黨決定保持</p>
<p>互惠貿易</p>
<p>計劃與否，似半決定兩黨一致外交政策之是否繼續。范氏有一九四八年共和黨總統候選人之目，渠顯欲防止共和黨在下屆競選運動時，被民主黨指爲「孤立主義者」。西部各州一部份參議員見解從同。故衆議院倘若力促通過澈底之改革方案，參議方面或將阻其通過。此乃范氏不欲伴同國務鄕馬歇爾參加三月間莫斯科外長會議開幕式之主要原因之一。</p>
<h3>范登堡不致出任　下屆總統候選人</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社密歇根州大　比特城八日電〕共和黨參議員范登堡今日在此發表演說，籲請勞資息爭。略謂：美國目前之形勢，勞資雙方無限制互扼咽喉，簡直等於自殺。政府應採取新勞工法，特別用以代替罷工禁令。因罷工損毁公共財產，等於內亂。同時范氏又向報界談稱：本人不致出任下屆總統候選人。</p>
<h3>本哲布回盟份子　被捕者萬三千人</h3>

<h3>紅外綫的軍事用途　戰時一大秘密今已揭曉</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕紅外綫硏究之情形，在戰時爲一極端之秘密，今此項禁令已吿撤除，乃知此項紅外綫亦曾被適用於作戰方面。譬如以紅外錢作信號，他人不能望見而具有特殊裝置者則可收得之。　繫德袖珍主力艦「寶畢資」號及另一日主戰艦之小型潛艇，一九四四年九月整沉挪威貝爾根港巨型浮動船塢之役，　斷太平洋海底電綫之活動，以及北菲登陸戰時均曾使用之。此外地下運動人士之秘密活動，盟俘之脫逃以及黑夜波萊茵河之役等，均曾藉紅外綫之指禾。皇家空軍之夜間戰鬥，亦藉紅外綫爲信號，在兩樓戰中紅外綫更爲海陸空間最神妙之連絡。自動武器配有紅外綫自動瞄準器者亦已發明，但因戰事結束還早，尙未正式用於戰塲。</p>
<h3>原子能管制計劃　美不願有所讓步　范登堡明告蘇聨巧言無裨實際　裁軍問題已陷於僵局</h3>
<p>〔路透社密歇根州大瀑布城八日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡在此談稱：吾人決不單獨解除武裝，今世界大部份土地尙爲鐵幕所隔。鐵幕後面之情形，非經目睹，實難以令人信任。但若有制裁違背裁軍之約定，吾人亦願與他國同時栽軍。爲表示國際善意起見，美國準備放棄原子彈之利益，但此項放棄必須有完善之檢査及管制制度保護之，更須世界各國尤其是蘇聯，迅速同意制裁違的行爲者。此乃吾人所索之代價，而此一代價非付不可。吾人決不信任任何善變的言辭，良以雅爾達，波茨坦之的定，以及波蘭最近之諾言，被破壞實已太多故也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖九日電〕美蘇兩國代表在安理會小組會中，對於未來裁軍委會之職權範圍，意見朱能完全一致，此間聯合國人士頗爲氣餒而悲觀。査美國希望裁軍委會組織法中規定勿牽涉原子能委會職權範圍內之事務，蘇聯則反對在草案中作此規定。故本月十一日安理會開會時，雙方有劍拔弩張之勢，預料會中不致運用否決權，但蘇聯僅僅出以反對，已足使任何裁軍委會之組織有名而無實。故在安理會表決此案前，雙方當盡力獲致協議。大抵美蘇間之不和，由於猜忌而起，因美代表團深信蘇聯希望栽軍委會終於包括原子能委會之範闡與作用故也。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦問題　英新方案內容</h3>
<p>設立五年託管制</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕出席巴勒斯坦會議之阿拉伯代表團，今晨在埃及大使館開會後，宣布正在起草覆文，將於星期一向英代表團提出，以答覆英政府最近關於巴勒斯坦之新方案。同時據巴勒斯坦阿拉伯黨秘書戈里表示，阿族對英國新建議，顯然不能滿意。猶太協會定今晚討論英國新方案，據悉，後者之內容爲設立五年託管制，召開制憲議會，以決定永久憲法。在託管期內，設猶太及阿拉伯顧問委員會，以輔助英中央政府。</p>
<h3>日本全國普選　五月中旬舉行　兩新黨將實行合併</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京九日電〕日閣議八日決定於三月底前優速完成此次議會應行任務，在此期間內謀憲法附屬法案獲得通過，至於何時解散議會，因與參議員之選舉及地方選舉等有關，故未決定。內相植原今日表示實行普選日期，大抵在五月中旬。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕據報：協同民主黨與國民黨將合併，準備參加下屆總選，此乃對麥克阿　致函首相士田茂，囑其現行議會會議閉會後，儘速舉行總選之最近應。該兩黨均係新黨，黨員不多，兩黨合併，在選舉時較多當選機會，兩黨合併，足能在議會中佔得七十八席，故合併後可在現內閣中成爲一大黨。</p>
<p>社會黨內部意見未一致</p>
<p>〔改造社東京九日電〕社會黨議員今日開會討論組織聯合內閣問題，武藤運十郞，森三樹二等主張放棄聯合工作。杉本勝次，吉川兼光等則贊成聯合工作。書記長西尾表示，如目前立即實行普選，自應放棄聯合工作，然此次議會議案甚多，會期勢必延長至四月廿日左右，至五月廿日左右始能實行普選，新內閣之成立，當在五月杪至六月初之間，在此期間內，政治是否可以委諸保守政權，殊有考慮之餘地。</p>

<h3>英煤荒嚴重　政府臨危機</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕英國工業今日瀕於大規模停頓之境，同時工黨發言人提出警吿稱，煤荒危機使工黨政府有結束之虞，社會主義興起，此其時矣。據悉倫敦孟却斯特及伯明罕等大工業地帶情形殆已混亂，工人四百萬名將於星期日午夜起宣吿失業。</p>
<p>〔路透社敦九日電〕保守黨將於週末召開會議，討論煤斤危機，結果可能決定在下院動議不信任政府案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕燃藥部長興威爾昨在下院宣布，因煤斤缺乏，致使半個英倫停電後，現成爲英國各報（包括工黨報紙在內）抨擊之目標。三家保守黨地方報紙稱，「興威爾該滾！」工黨機關報「每日前鋒報」稱，「直言之，吾人認爲若千閣員無異自欺欺人」。興氏對停電時日久暫程度不願置詞，但報界堅信至少須二星期。自由黨少數人士在倫敦會議中要求興氏退位讓賢，但興氏吿記者稱，渠無辭職之意。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕法國內閣今日在歐禮和總統主持下開會，通過一項決議，規定阿爾薩斯與勞關二地人民前被希特勒徴入軍伍進攻法國致今日仍居留在德國俘處營內者，法國政府今將盡其所能，早日遣送彼等回返原籍。最後通過一大赦令草案，但通敵犯不在其內。</p>
<h3>解除美國赤色威脅　共和黨決全力以赴　美眾院議長馬丁表示</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕衆院議長馬丁今日接見記者時，保證共和黨將進行解除美國赤色威脅。渠稱：共和黨將與衆院匪美國人活動委會通力合作，對付該委會主席湯麥斯所謂共黨陰謀。該委會目的在自美國解除赤色威脅，將其逐出政府。蓋少數盤踞戰略地位之有力人士業已發動破壞美利堅制度，而代之以共產主義。馬氏復稱：「彼等即係居戶內之敵人，身居顯要，企圖搖動政策，左右興諭」。又據湯麥斯稱：上星期四該會與美國共黨領袖艾斯勒之抗衡，僅係揭破共黨推翻美政府陰謀運動之發端。</p>

<h3>美國政府的一個嚴正報告　蘇聨戰力的剖視（上）</h3>
<p>— 張德乾節譯</p>
<p>美國國會圖書館近應伊利諾州衆議員賣克遜之請，編印一本硏究蘇聯現狀的書，題名爲「共產主義的實踐」，由政府印刷局出版。該書係據官方檔案，加以精密分析，編纂而成，取材廣博，立論公正，極有價値。下面所節譯的爲該書關於蘇聯軍備的一章。</p>
<p>五個五年計劃努力趕上英美</p>
<p>一九四六至一九七領年的二十五年間，蘇聯定下五個五年計劃，準備接連着分期實行。蘇聯的國防軍備也大部係以該項五年計劃爲根據。由史達林近來所發表的演說中可以看出，他要想把蘇聯的戰力提高到和目前美國的戰力相等。史達林曾說過，照他預料，將來的世界是難免要發生衝突的。他曾爲科學硏究和農工生產（實際就是軍事生產）定下幾個目標，使蘇聯能够應付一切可能的事故與後果。</p>
<p>在一九四六至一九五〇年的那個五年計劃中，有一項主要的工作就是繼續提高蘇聯的國防力量，以現代化的配備供應她的軍隊。</p>
<p>這個五年計劃極注重科學研究，允其是攸關國防計劃的科學。原子硏究最佔優先。他們用極大的力量促使全國專家努力硏究，以期趕上英美。</p>
<p>在一九四六至一九七〇年的五個五年計劃中，其有關國防者大致如下；</p>
<p>（一）鋼鐵生產增加到每年六千萬噸（美國在一九四五年內的產八千萬噸）；</p>
<p>（二）生鐵生產增加每年五千萬噸（差不多和美國一九四五午的產量相等）；</p>
<p>（三）每年產煤五萬萬噸（美國在一九四五年內產瀝靑煤五萬七千五百萬噸）；</p>
<p>（四）每年產汕四萬二千萬桶（美國在一九四五年內產汕的十七萬萬桶）。　在研究上列數字時，我們得記住，美國一九四五年的生產量是因爲戰局迫切，竭力擴充工廠範圍，才得達到這樣大的數字的。現在戰事已經結束，在最近幾年內美國的生產量或許會逐漸低落下去。同時蘇聯却在計劃將戰時所設的工廠加以擴充。</p>
<p>美國已經開始發覺她有幾種最富的資源快要採光了。同時蘇聨卻宣稱，世界上對於工業發展和國防有重大關係的許多種礦物和原料，有一半以上都在蘇聯境內。尤其是，據蘇聯宣稱，世界上已經知道的油礦和鐵礦有一半以上都在蘇聯手中。農業對於國防極爲重要，世界上也只有美國才能和蘇聯相比。</p>
<p>蘇聨政府已經計劃爲工業疏遣程序，將來如果有敵國進攻，就決不至於再會把她的工業重心一網打盡了。疏散程序由戰時加速進行，現在仍在繼續中。</p>
<p>廿五年後兵力可達五國總和</p>
<p>蘇聯目前的兵力是比不上美國的。她雖然尙保持着一個强大的陸軍，可是她曾在二次大戰中損失過幾百萬靑年，後來補充進去的新兵，都未受過訓練，而且有許多人尙未達到兵役年齡。蘇聯雖能生產大量坦克和槍砲，但尙不能製造够得上和人家競爭的長距離飛機。蘇聯的電子工業也不發達。蘇聯的海軍，在最近幾年內是大大地強化了，但和英美海軍比起來，還是弱小得很。然而，無論如何，蘇聯的潛在的戰力終是値得吾人嚴密注意的。</p>
<p>如果照史達林於一九四六年二月九日所發表的演說去實行，那末，照官方預料，在二十年之內，蘇聯的原有人口（就是二次大戰以前蘇聯原有版圖內的人口）將增加到二萬五千萬。如果把戰後併入蘇聯版圖的波羅的各國計算在內，那木，到一九七〇年蘇聯的人口還可以增加幾百萬，或許更多些。到那時候，光是蘇聯原有人口中或許就有三千二百萬在二十歲至三十四歲之間的男子，其中有二千二百萬在二十歲至二十九歲之間，屬於最合理想的兵役軍　。</p>
<p>在同時期內，美國的人口將達到一萬六千萬人，其中有一千八百萬人爲廿歲至卅四歲的男子，在廿歲至廿九歲之間的約有一千零五十萬人。</p>
<p>蘇聯在一九七〇年中所有的三千二百萬男子，差不多等於美英法德義五國所有兵役年齡人力的總和。</p>

<p>昨晨九時有人以「愛用國貨抵制美貨　備委員會」名義，召集各工會工人，舉行籌備大會。其所發通知之開會地址，爲新都酒樓。各工會接獲通知後，未明眞相，多造派代表前往參加。時新都空無一人，復傳改在大新公司樓上，結果亦復如是。最後始悉係在南京路三三四號中華勸工銀行大樓三樓舉行。陸續參加者共有百餘人。大會由郭沫若，鄧初民主持，並當塲散發「愛用國貨抵制美貨吿各界人士書」，及「美國貨害人精」，「製造內亂的混蛋」。「趕不走那美軍心不甘」，「美國軍隊快滾蛋」等歌曲。一部份參加者，羣起合唱。同時繼續到會者尙有羅隆基，馬叙倫，馬寅初等，惟旋即離去。</p>
<p>突起鬥歐　秩序大亂</p>
<p>多數參加者，原係爲提倡愛用國貨而來，到會後，始悉並非愛用國貨運動，而係具有政治作用之反美運動，乃羣起反對，一時秩序大亂，竟致發生毆打情事。毆打中，並有人高呼一打倒國民政府」等口號。毆打發生後，市警局黄浦分局接獲報吿，即派警前往彈壓，維持秩序。當將互毆羣衆十八名，（其中一名梁仁達，因受重傷，轉送仁濟醫院救治），帶至黄浦分局。內十一人受輕傷，到局後即由該分局派警陪同赴仁濟醫院包紮後回局，經第二股詢問一過，於昨日黄昏時分別交保釋出。該案將於今晨以妨害秩序罪，移解法院辦理。</p>
<p>十七人名單</p>
<p>該項帶局並經當晚釋放之十七人，名單如次：（一）曹振坤，（中紡第一廠），（二）沈俠峰，（中華烟草公司）（三）王玉祥，（工人），（四）王福根，（中紡十六廠），（五）蔡福田，（工人），（六）孟智勝，（工人），（七）陳恂貫，（住國貨公司宿舍），（八）李拔雄，（新新公司職員），（九）孫壽康，（先拖公司職員），（十）楊俊，（工人住新新公司宿舍），（十一）沈世魁，（住國貨公司宿舍），（十二）杜學三，（冠生園），（十三）徐緯成，（新新公司出店），（十四）劉宗德，（康樂酒家），（十五）李瑞椿，（永安公司），（十六）曾永全，（永安公司），（十七）宋勇，（永安公司）。</p>
<h3>俞副局長　慰問傷者</h3>
<p>又市警局副局長兪叔平，昨日下午三時，特偕黄浦分局長張人佑，前往仁濟醫院慰問重傷者梁仁達。時梁已人昏迷狀態，經醫師診斷爲「顧底骨折，腦震盪出血」，兪氏除囑醫師細心診治外，並對梁君家屬，備予撫慰。後兪副局長並至黄浦分局親詢帶局五人，至梁仁達則延至下午四時卅分，傷重身元。</p>
<h3>死者梁仁達　父母雙亡　結婚未久</h3>
<p>記者昨晚赴浙江北路永樂新村六號被毆慘死之梁仁達，寓所訪問，時梁君嬸母梁區氏甫由黃浦分局啼哭返家，據稱：「死者三十歲，廣東中山人，曾於香港培新英文學校肄業，來滬後，即服務永安公司皮鞋部，迄今十數載。今晨八時自家赴公司，十時許聞有人打架，我即偕其妻赴公司尋找，不遇，遂即返家，不意至四時醫院派車前來，通知受傷，四時半即斃命。事後聽說其至公司後，有人吿知勸工大樓開會，渠即隨同前往，不料在樓梯中，被打受傷。」繼謂：「梁去年五月結婚，其妻高紹珊，亦在永安三廠條子部作工，現已懷孕五月，平時並無積蓄，將來生活頗成問題。」伊又稱：「死者少年父母雙亡，由其叔及我撫養成人，今遭此不幸，實甚寃枉，刻善後事宜，僅有永安公司兩同事帮同照料，我已赴黄浦分局請求伸寃，經囑於明晨九時偕同侄媳再往」云。</p>
<h3>俞叔平發表談話　互毆者被捕後已准保釋　不惜任何代價救治傷人</h3>
<p>警察局兪叔平副局長，昨日下午四時向記者發表談話，對昨晨南京路互毆案表示兩點（一）今晨工人集會，本局於事先並未接獲通知，警察局爲負責全滬治安之機關，凡有擾亂社會秩序安寗者，不論其爲何人，均有予以制止逮捕之權故此兇毆案　里後，警局聞警趕到，即執行職權，不論其雙方毆鬥之內幕如何，見有互毆者，即一律予以逮捕。茲接市長諭令，對各被捕者，准予交保釋放，現正辦理交保手續中，於今晚（即昨日）前可一律保釋，並將此案移送地方法院依法辦理。（二）本人與黄浦分局張分局長，於下午三時，特往慰問在此次互毆事件中受傷最重在仁濟醫院救治中之梁仁達，梁君傷在頭部，現在昏迷狀態中，本人已囑主治醫師不惜任何醫藥用品之代價，盡力救治。</p>
<h3>事先若能獲知　相信不致肇事　黄浦分局長答覆兩點</h3>
<p>自昨晨因一愛用國貨抵制美貨籌備委員會」開會發生毆打事件後，下午六時許，黄浦分局正在辦理互毆羣業保釋手續時，有郭沫若，沈鈞儒，馬寅初，胡子嬰等，以「中國學術工作者協會」代表名義，前往該局慰問受傷者。郭等向張分局長提出兩點詢問：（一）今晨事件，因何洋得如此糟？（二）警局對本案如何處理？當由張分局長答覆：「（一）今晨開會，警局事先並未得知，打榮後，醫局才曉得因開會而引起毆鬥。本局於獲報後，立即派遣警員，馳往維持秩序，並將互相毆鬥者帶局，依法辦理。假如今晨之集會，警局能於事先獲知，則相信不致發生此不幸事件。（二）互相毆鬥，爲妨害治安，妨害秩序之行爲，此案將移送法院辦理，所有因毆鬥而被捕者，除梁仁達送醫院救治外，餘均將於今晚前交保釋放。」</p>
<h3>建議中區消防隊民辦　陳霆銳提供具體方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參政員陳　銳前曾爲西摩路武定路大火案，向市參議會建議將中區消防隊改爲民辦，旋經該會送交警政委員會決議，請陳氏提供具體方案，以便提交大會討論。茲悉該會已經接獲陳氏致正副議長復函，首先說明本市中心區消防事業之弊病：（一）事權不能統一，上級長官之精神光陰，泰半耗費於等因奉此之中，即經長時間之公事往返，亦每不能獲得具體之結果。（二）消防處缺乏專門人才，如新式雲梯車與化學救火，均因乏人運用，致不能發揮作用。（三）消防員待遇菲薄，不足溫飽，以致形成上失尊嚴，下無法紀之局面。消防員失職固有負於市民，但政府失職亦豈不有負於消防員與市民，如將一切責任加之於消防員，殊非公允之　。（四）經費太不充裕。（五）消防技術日趨低落。</p>
<p>次言改善滬市消防，惟有出於民辦一法，並分述優點如下：（一）事權統一。毋虞牽制。（二）消防員除上級職員，顧用專門人才外，可用義勇制度，經費可以大省。（三）義勇消防員有服務義勇精神。（四）凡事民辦，決無官僚化。添置設　，配購零件，統可公開，無處貪汚。</p>
<h3>美軍法庭結束後　楊格主任仍留滬</h3>
<p>美駐華軍事法庭自執行審訊日德國國戰犯工作以來，自一九四五年秋至今年春，已將兩載，先後審判漢口謀殺案，杜立德飛行員受害案，以至德國納粹間謀案等大小案件，共計二十件之多。自歐哈德案審結後，美軍事法庭工作亦吿結束，美戰犯調査委會之人員亦先後返國，但該會之主任楊格上校，則仍在滬，因美軍方面尙有少數案件，未能結束，而德國戰犯遣撤回國之工作，亦須處理，故將稍作逗留。</p>
<h3>催請發還舊欠　前工部局華員　組索償委員會　要求依照生活指數核算　數額龐大市府不勝負担</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前工部局及法公董局職員爲要求發還退職金儲畜金養老金問題，自勝利後催償至今，迄未獲得解決。去年吳市長接任後，曾組織上海市前租界官。有債權與債務淸理委員會，下設小組，專門討論此事，但因種種困難，亦朱能即刻解決。其中法公董局部份，至今猶在調査賬册名額等事中。工部局部份據傳已擬定辦法，但其內容，雖經記者一再探詢，官方皆秘而不宣。據市府某職員吿記者，如依目前生活指數計算，其數額約與本年市府之全部澦算相等，自非地方政府所能負担。</p>
<p>根據一九四三年一月十一日英美與我國政府所簽訂之撤銷治外法權條約，其中有規定前工部局之債權與債務統由我政府承繼，負責處理。故前工部局職員認爲我政府應尊重條約，履行此義務，償還彼等之退職，養老及儲蓄金。條約旣係中央政府負責簽訂，故償付亦應由中央政府負責，非地方政府之事。如言數額過鉅，則政府出售敵僞產業之進益甚多，遠過此數，可以其一部份撥付。</p>
<h3>堅持三月底前　必須全部發清</h3>
<p>前工部局羣員總會同人，包括該局總辦處，財務處，捐務處，工務處，衛生處，敎育處，消防處，華文處，法律處全體華員五千七百人（警務處除外），爲此特組織索償委員會，於昨日下午招待記者，發表吿各界人士餮，要求政府當局無論如何在本年三月底前全部發淸，並堅決要求按照發放時之生活指數計算，因此款係根據民國二十五年之底薪扣算者。當局會一度有意依去年十二月指數五千餘倍發給，但　　至今，指數已升至八千餘倍，長此拖延，祗與政府無利，據估計二每人存款，平均約四千元。</p>
<p>此外關於日期之計算，彼等堅特中國職員應與英美籍職員完全同等辦理。</p>
<h3>今後飛機如再有失事　將以過失殺人罪起訴　兩公司機航人員　灰心提辭呈</h3>
<p>中國，中央兩航空公司客運，已由交通部於上週五命令恢復，惟兩公司客機，於上週迄未復航。據悉，因準備工作尙未就緒，均將展緩二三日後復航。唯郵貨運方面，兩公司仍照常飛行。又據其他方面消息，兩公司機航組負責人，因地檢處議吿彼等，如客機再度失事，則地檢處將以過失殺人罪對機航組負責人提出公訴，因此兩公司機運組負責人，以客機失事非人力能預測，機航組方面對今後客運，無法保證絕對安全，均分向公司當局提出辭呈。公司當局除慰留機航組人員仍安心工作外，一面呈請交通部批示處理之辦法。</p>

<h3>各業工會發表宣言　詳敍騙參加經過　請示政府澈查業辦</h3>
<p>上海市各業工會，為工友多名昨日（九日）受騙參加「愛用國貨抵制美貨」大會被毆事件，發表宣言如次：</p>
<p>「親愛的同胞們：昨日下等同，我們各工會接到一件通知，是「愛用國貨抵制美制　備委員會」發來回的，要我們今天上午九時到文本路天津路口新都劇塲開會，討論推行國國貨方針，那通知開首便敍明集會目的，是「為推行國貨，挽救工商業危機」，我們工人最感受工商凋敝的痛苦，天天用盡勞力，想增加一點生產來支撐這危難的局面，「推行國貨」。早已是我們心底的要求，因之我們抱了一勝熱誠，今天大昨晚上便趕到新都劇塲。到達之後，門口兩位衣襟上佩帶紅花的朋友行嘛換們，會塲臨時改在　工大樓，於是我又趕到勸工大樓，但到我們趕到的時候，裏似乎已經在開會了。台上有敦沫若，鄧初民兩位先生，台下一部分人，正在大唱「美國軍隊快滾蛋」，「趕不走那美軍心不廿」，「製造內戰的混蛋」，「美國貨害人精」四只歌曲，歌詞裏面，除了激動反美情緒外，根本沒有提到推行國貨。我們開始感到不安，心裏想，一定又是什麽黨派在利用「推行國貨」的口號，來發動其「反美行為」，正大　躊躇間，忽然大喊打到「國民政府」，「擁護共產黨」等口號，至此其眞面目竟完全暴露，吾人這羣工人，也正和在塲許多羣眾一樣，內心突然涌起一股被欺騙後的憤慨，我們責問那些身佩紅花，手持革報的朋友，為什麽不「推行國貨」的事情，而專在「驅農美軍」，「打倒國民政府」題目上，大做文章。不料這些話竟觸犯了那般佩紅花的朋友，不容分說，開口罵「搗亂份子」，高呼一聲「打」，桌椅板櫈一齊飛來，可憐無辜羣眾，紛紛被擊倒。事後得悉七人受傷，其中一人已傷重斃命，眞未想到高唱「民主」「自由」的人們，此種無恥手段，愚弄善良的工人，以作其政治門爭的犧牲品，實在令人不寒而慄！</p>
<p>人民的眼睛是亮的，這種把戲，只能欺騙一時，不能蒙蔽我們，工人知識雖低，自信當能判別是非，決不為少數別具肺腑的野家所利用，這次的欺騙，使人們感到被強姦一樣的侮辱，我們不會玩弄動人的名詞，更不會花言巧語，只是老老實實，把事實眞象，公諸社會，願公正人士，給予我們以正義的同情。</p>
<p>最後我們願以嚴肅的心情，表明我們的態度。（一）我勿堅決支持推行國貨運動，並請本市參議會，領導各界，即刻組織眞能代表民意的推行國貨運動機構，硏究積極推動之。（二）我勿堅決反對竊「推行國貨」之口號，以從事其政治陰謀之勾當。（三）我們認此次不幸事件，應由「愛用國貨抵制美貨等備委員會」完全負責，衣求政府澈查該會主持人，嚴予懲辦！</p>
<h3>神奇奧妙　虹僑盲童學校一青年　失明十五年恢復視覺　奧籍眼土名醫富敎授妙手回春　將他從黑暗和失望中拯救出來</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕即使這不是奇蹟至少也是世界上罕有的事情，一個失明了十五年的少年，經過奧籍眼科名醫師富克斯敎授神妙手術後，今天已能重見光明，這不僅會使受惠者本人感到歡欣，相信每一個聽到這消息的人，都會覺得這世界上的事，是多麽的神奇奧妙，而富敎授的妙手回春之術更不能不令人欽佩，令人驚異。</p>
<p>三歲時候雙目失明</p>
<p>這幸運兒名呌王大衛，今年二十歲，福建漳州人，據他吿訴記者，三歲的時候，雙目即失明，後來給一位外國人帶到了新加坡去，醫治無效，即在他七歲那年把他送到上海盲童學校來。初來時還能看見些陽光，以後愈久愈深，致失去了全部光明。在盲童學校挨過了十三個年頭，這十幾年來，物質上雖能得到安慰，可是眼前一切都是黑暗和失望。像天腸給他的謀一般，富敎授在四個月前由維也納來到中國講學，入盲童學校專任醫治，富敎授即開始檢査八十多個學生的眼睛，發現了有二個還可以設汰恢復視覺的，童二個中的一個就是王大衛。</p>
<p>眼珠開洞已能賭物</p>
<p>富敎授硏究王大衛的眼睛，發現他的右眼有希望，但施行手術很複雜，若按普通方法，把別人的　人移給他是不適通的，於是在他眼珠上開了一個洞。開刀的結果非常良好，僅僅不過二十天來，大衛已能在四米突外看得見手指，草地中間站的人，對面的窗子都能看出。富敎授說：「再過幾個月他的目光即可漸漸恢復，但他現在要學習利用眼睛的幫助來走路，看東西。眼膜淸楚後即可分辨餌色。」其實，大衛在昨天見到許多記者圍巾的顏色，已能正確的辨別出十之七八了。他還能講一些不太壞的英語，認識幾個英文字，經此他將開始好好學習中文，正式讀書了。</p>
<p>另外，還有一個期待着重見天日的是一個山車男孩名邵恩承，今年七歲，將在下週內施行手術，我們當爲他祈禱，使這孩子也能脫雖黑暗世界。</p>
<p>盲童學校慘淡經營</p>
<p>虹橋路盲童學會，是在三十五年前由英國人的　弗來亞所創設，剛開辦時有經費美金七萬元和銀子五萬兩，後來買了些股票，靠利息維持下去，到今天已到了山窮水盡的時候了。老弗來亞死後，由他兒子喬治繼承父志，繼續辦理，現在他到英美各國去硏究百人新的敎育方法，預備回來後給中國的盲童有更大的造福。在他離校期間，由鮑桑代理，副校長何子健在該校服務已達三十餘年，對於肓童敎育提問，不遺餘力。</p>
<p>校舍佈置到處整潔</p>
<p>當記者們被領導參觀肓童學校校舍時，發現一切佈置均極整潔，富敎授再三向記者說他初來之時，第一件使他感到，驚訝和感動的事是這學校到處都是非常淸潔他說他從來沒有見過一個盲人的地方有這樣淸潔的，而這些整理草木，搬運石塊，掃除工作都是盲童自已做的。這時，他又忙介紹女生部的主任葉重華女士和鮑夫人說都是他們兩位督導的結果。院內中道，往到轉角處的地方，都用石塊舖成（其他是水門汀），這是特地作為盲童走路時記號的。</p>
<p>臨別他然無窮感慨</p>
<p>校內的經費是非常拮据的，學生們做的手工可以在該校出售，但究竟有限得很。他們收費的標準是有錢者繳，不能者免，按規定半年學費膳宿一共四十一萬元，但能繳者僅十分之一。因此一切開支都祗能靠捐助度日了。鮑代校長哭喪着臉陪記者參觀校內僅有的一只破打字機說：這只打字機實在有二十年的歷史了，要想敎學生學打字，可是沒有錢買打字機，希望能借報章一角之地呼籲請求任何打字機行捐助一二舊打字機，也可勉強利用，對學生是得益匪淺的了。</p>
<p>當我們眼看着一羣天眞活潑的孩子。站在陽光底下嬉戲，然而他們却見不到陽光，每個人心中都會浮起一陣悲酸惋惜的情緒，我們希望世界有許許多多富克斯敎授，把每個盲人都從黑暗中拯救出來。</p>
<h3>太古碼頭工潮　昨日調解未成</h3>

<h3>上海城始末記</h3>
<p>— 本報特稿</p>
<p>三十年前到上海來觀光的人，看見沒有城墻，認爲一件奇事。上海得風氣之先，鼎革以後，早就實行拆城築路了。上海拆城、雖比別處平，可是築城却比別處遜。明嘉靖三十二年，因倭寇騷擾而築城，迄民國三年，改建馬路完竣，前後祗有三百六十年的歷史。</p>
<p>最上海是一片荒涼沙灘，僅有極少數的漁戶居住着，直至元至正廿九年始改稱爲上海縣。改縣之後，又過了二百六十一年尙未建築縣城。蓋海疆民風强悍，常習武事，足以自衛，海盜不敢輕易光降。而且那時人齋不多，財政据拙，也無法籌揹這筆造城費用。所以在門戶開放之下，度過了二百多年。</p>
<p>至明代中葉，商業日盛，戶齋漸繁，殷實之家，亦都遷至縣治所在。其時倭寇縱橫海上，上海也曾光顧幾次。嘉靖三十二年四月十九日，倭寇又至，勢甚猖獗，政連賓華橋等處，知縣俞顯科逃遁，縣市大遭蹂躪。五月間，高昌渡水師又爲倭寇擊潰，市民逃散，聽其恣意刦掠，縣署半成焦土。六月中海盜自金山駕艦來，威脅滬市。兩個月間，連遭寇禍，於是官吏市民，始知防守之要，遂創建城之議。</p>
<p>嘉靖三十二年以前，邑紳顧從禮曾奏請築城，但未經工部審度，倭寇已臨，遂未與築。其時上海屢這寇禍，創鉅痛深，松江知府方廉見人民慘受刦掠，創議築城。於是糾衆籌畫，徵集田糧，並出庫藏羨餘，以充經費。令通判李國紀監工，隨即相度基址，於九月間開始動工，日夜趕築歷二月即竣工。</p>
<p>當籌議築城之時，富家巨室，因房價頗高，不願拆屋捐地，所以反對的人很多。其後有許多明白事理，急公好義的士紳，首先捐資拆屋，以助其成，使反對者無所藉口，祗得服從衆意，忍痛贊助。費用不足，也賴邑人捐輸。其中如王相堯是拆屋捐地，傾囊助役的第一人，城雖築成，他已從富，一變爲貧民了。貢生張泮，不僅盡散家財以助，並親自持鉀眷土，參加工作，以致積勞成疾而死。陸文裕公夫人梅氏，捐銀二千兩，毀市房數千間，在中幗中亦爲難得。</p>
<p>這所新築的上海縣城，周團共長九里，高二丈四尺，闢城門六處，即朝宗·跨龍·儀鳳·晏海·寶帶·朝陽六門是，水門祗設三處：在東西的都跨肇嘉浜，另一處則跨方浜。城上有雉堞三千六百多個，敵樓兩座。城濠長一千五百餘丈，廣六丈，深一丈七尺，環繞城外，通接潮汐。　城垣築成後的第二年正月，倭寇駕臨，直逼城下。可是這次有了城墻，按察司僉事董邦正閉城固守，倭寇始終未能侵入城內。此後又屢遭攻擊，均未破城而入。</p>
<h3>漫話東西兩城門　一個是國際貿易市場　一個是宗敎滙集之地</h3>
<p>上海城東臨黄浦江，在租界未開闢前，縣城是最熱鬧的地方，香舶沿浦江而來，城東浦濱，成爲碼頭焦點。所以這裏很早已有國際貿易市塲。小東門大東門乃萬商雲集之處。</p>
<p>現在民國路外，舟山路和高橋路之間，有一條短短的馬路，呌做洋行街的，即是最早外商集中之所。這條洋行街，在淸嘉慶十九年所修的上海縣志上，已有記載，可見其歷史之長久，同時洋行街之成名，並不是五口通商以後之事。常初有裏洋行街和外洋行街，兩條是並行的，如今祗剩一條了。</p>
<p>海關舊址</p>
<p>上海海關，最初也設在東門以外。當淸康熙二十三年，廢除海禁後，决年即設海關，稱爲「江海大關」。面對黄浦，坐鎭其間，船舶進港，都要在那裹經過。至道光二十三年，上海闢爲商埠，接着英法僑民在城北闢爲租界，於是北市商業漸興，南市盛况，漸爲所奪。上海道乃於北門外頭壩另建新關，又稱北關。小東門的大關變爲南關，一稱老關。</p>
<p>至於西門，最先應該提到黄家闕路，那是元代黄銘的故居。他的住宅呌做西郊野趣軒，人家稱他爲西郊先生。其時上海雖已設治，然尙沒有縣城，縣治設在舊城中心，所以「西郊」云云，即等於後來的「西門外」。</p>
<p>文廟公園</p>
<p>文廟公園，對於住在西門一帶的人，特別有利，這正像住在中山公園復典公園附近的人一樣的方便。文廟原是紀念孔子的建築物，全國各城各縣都有。上海之有文廟，的已六百餘年，但在六百餘年間，廟址却變更了五次，現今的文廟，建築至今，不過八十餘年，乃上海開埠以後之事。最初將鎭學改爲縣學，是在元代貞元元年，（一二九五年）地點在方浜橋長生橋東北。不久遷至現在的敬業路，廟基略加擴大。至大三年（一三一〇年）三决遷移，在湘沙塲一帶，收買民田五十餘畝，建築新學宮，文廟纔和西門發生關係。到了延裕元年（一三一四年），縣丞王珪又把它遷回了老家，這一次很久，廟址亦愈宏大，安然地經過了五百餘年。直到淸咸豐三年（一八五三年）小刀會佔領上海縣城，文廟成爲他們發號施令的大本營。待小刀會退出時，廟中殿閣祠堂，幾已燬壊殆盡。戰事平定之後，興工重建此即現今的文廟。文廟在東西兩門，數度遷移，結果終於回到了西門。</p>
<p>十方業林</p>
<p>西門可說是宗敎的集合地，除了儒敎中心的文廟以外，還有一個道敎的中心，即方斜路的白雲觀是，始創於光緒八年（一八八二年），最初不過一座小小的雷祖殿，過了六年，領得道藏，才仿照京師白雲觀的成例，定爲「十方業林」，改稱白雲觀。</p>
<p>基督敎在西門也凑了一份子，那裏有一所裨文女學和一所婦孺醫院，都是敎會所辦的。裨文女中紀念美國基督敎公理牧師裨治文的。婦孺醫院爲美國女公會敎士羅斯耐德所創辦，成立於淸光緒十一年。這兩所敎會所辦的事業，與文廟白雲觀在西門成爲鼎足三分之勢。</p>
<h3>闢設小南門　一段小掌故</h3>
<p>小南門在縣城初築時即有，萬曆縣志上寫得淸淸楚楚。另有一說，係爲邑廟豫園中那塊玉玲瓏石而闢的，則似乎在其他五門之後了。但計算起來，此事離嘉靖葺城不遠，即在萬曆之前，亦與事實不連。姑且把他寫下來，以待硏究上海歷史的人來考證。</p>
<p>豫園本爲明代尙書潘恩的別墅。內有香雪堂，爲該園名勝之一，堂前置有巨石三塊，均極名貴，其中有名玉玲瓏者爲最大，高丈餘，色靑黝，萬孔靈通，更屬珍品。</p>
<p>此石原是浦東三林莊南園的舊物。當儲昱退休林下時，常摩挲此石以自娛。他曾把香爐放在石底，靑烟從每一個石孔裹，嬝嬝而出。又曾以水一盆，從石頂上灌下去，則全石孔孔流泉，玉玲瓏之得名，實非過譽。</p>
<p>儲昱和潘恩是兒女親家，儲的女兒，嫁給潘的兒子允亮。儲死後無嗣，允亮就把這玉玲瓏石移置於自己的豫園中。</p>
<p>三林莊距上海縣城十餘里，復有一浦之隔，運送此石，着實費了些錢，不料在渡浦的時候，風浪大作，迎舟帶石，一齊沉入江心。於是雇善泅水者，入水搜尋，以巨綆擊石，牽曳上岸。時水底另有一石，在繫綆時一併取了起來，原來就是玉玲瓏石的座子，天綠巧合，眞是塞翁失馬，安知非福了。</p>
<p>玉玲瓏石連座曳至岸上後，又嫌城門路遠，那時鄉紳勢盛，逕毀城垣而進。這因玉玲瓏而毀的城墻缺齋，事後不僅未曾修合，反而改爲城門，即小南門是也。</p>
<h3>拆城塡壕築路　幾番波拆　卒底於成</h3>
<p>辛亥革命後，上海情勢大變，拆城一事，又爲人所注意。分別呈請蘇滬兩都督及上海縣民政長，旋經批准。</p>
<p>批准後，即成立城濠路工事務所，由縣民政長吳警擔任所長，市長莫錫倫爲副所長，除評議員外，並設總務，工程，地畝，交涉各科。全部工程估計約需三十萬元，時已籌得五萬元，先從北半城拆起。</p>
<p>保產公會　起來阻撓</p>
<p>拆城並不能順利地進行，中間經過了幾番波折，第一是城壕租戶所組織的保產公會，起來阻撓。按慣例城濠公地是由防營管理，召人承租，以濟軍用。當淸末倡議拆城之時，即有保產公會出現，在縣屬城區自治公所與駐防綠營爭奪城壕公產中已大顯身手。這時又藉口城壕爲軍用地，抗命不遷，後又要求改狹路綫，早定租價，聲勢汹汹，揚言將與拆除者爲難。當局仍冷靜對付，除自小東門沿城根向北至丹鳳樓一段酌與改狹外，城壕所有權問題，經與蘇督程德全和江蘇水陸合營公產分局長朱大斌商定，歸縣署管理，風潮始平。</p>
<p>英軍義塜　阻止路綫</p>
<p>其次：在北半城的城根，有英軍義塜一處，阻住路綫，外交當局一再商請英領擇地遷移，而英領則堅持改直路綫幾瀕決裂。其後市政廳查得工部局在成都路北築路交涉案，乃請縣署轉請交涉使酌議。結果以大通路上一分七厘四毫的中國墳址，調換英軍義塚所讓出的土地。問題總算是解決了，可是照會公文往返，已延宕了許多時候。</p>
<p>拆牆塡壕　改築馬路</p>
<p>另一件是和法租界的交涉。北半城原和法租界毘連，正常拆城築路的工程進行間，又發生了路權問題。經縣知事和法領事會商的結果，簽訂了南市市政廳和法公董局管理華法馬路聯絡辦法七條，並有附件說明，後又續訂附件四條。對於界綫的劃分和管理權，均分別規定。　拆墻塡壕·改築馬路</p>
<p>工程於民國元年七月間開始，一面拆除城牆，隨即塡沒城壕與河浜，改築馬路。北半城的路面，計長八百五十丈，至民國二年六月方纔竣工。在和英法領事交涉之時，南半城的拆城工程已在進行中了，迨北半城路面完共長八百九十丈，於民國三年冬竣工。南半城路面稱中華路，北半城稱民國路。現在所謂「尙文路」「福佑路」「肇嘉路」，乃上海城門的紀念物。</p>
<p>餘下基地　繳價承領</p>
<p>塡壕築路所餘的基地，共有一百四十餘畝，經上海知縣呈准省方，由地方目治團體繳價承領，以補所缺經費。在召領期內，爲預防私售外人，滋生交涉起見，由縣署行文交涉使，轉行會丈局，不准在城內土地轉換道契，通諭書保遵守。民國三年五月，財政部令設城壕官產丈放局。該局總辦陶湘，會辦朱鈞弼實行變售，裁撤路工事務所，前已承領之地產同時取銷，所總產價發還。丈放局至民國五年結束，共收地價銀一百二十餘萬兩，除工程費外，上海鎭守使鄭汝成曾以工賑名義，提用三十萬元，餘款則悉解財政部。</p>
<h3>拆城未成　添闢城門　旣要守舊保留城墻　又想促進市面繁榮</h3>
<p>曹驤的折中辦法</p>
<p>自海禁大開以後，西洋船堅砲利，這座古老的城垣，已不足防守，却反成爲商業發展上的一個累贅，於是有拆城之議。</p>
<p>遜淸光緒三十二年，縣紳姚文枬等因城垣阻碍，商業難興，呈請上海道袁樹勛專奏，請援天津成案，准許拆除城墻，改造馬路，以利交通。時袁道雖十分同情，但守舊士紳，仍起而反對，始終米經兩江總督批准。</p>
<p>拆城計劃，不能實現，而北市繁榮，日甚一日，城內必常改進。次年，（宣統元年）曹讓建議一折中辦法，即開闢城門，以通車馬。經幾度籌商後，竟得政府許可，興工修建先從小西門着全</p>
<p>這新城門在大南門之北三里許，在城墻上擊一大洞，高十四英尺，寬十六英尺，頂作月弓形，題日尙文，添做鐵門兩扇。常時手部費用計銀二千餘兩，並設守城一員。</p>
<p>尙文門完成後，又添闢拱辰·福祐兩門，俱在宣統二年完竣。故除了原有六門，及太平軍時代添闢的新北門外，上海城又添三門。</p>

<h3>漫談輸入限額分配制度</h3>
<p>— 步兵</p>
<p>限額分配制度，在貿易政策上是一個極大的轉變；它直接對於某種進口貨物，在數量或價値上，加以限制，以保護或救濟國內產業，改善國際貸借，實現滙兌管理；所以它是一個主要的產業保護政策；然而它與向來所施行的保議政策相較，却有許多全新的特點。</p>
<p>第一是直接限制進口貨的數量：從來的保護政策，如爲保育幼稚產業，便施行育成關稅；爲保護獨占產業，便採用卡迭爾關稅；或是要維持一般的產業，則實行所謂救濟關稅；總之，一切都是利用關稅做保護的工具。——就是用增加關稅的方法，直接使外國貨進口價格提高，間接使進口貨數量减少，以保護國內的產業。但是，這種間接的方法，近來在國際經濟狀態之下，已不必能發揮其效果了。因爲金本位停止，滙兌率貶低，在所謂滙兌傾銷之下，縱然提高關稅，也不必定可以使進進口貨價增高；而且即使進口貨價可以增高，但因爲商品種類的不同，也不必能限制它的進口數量；所以要想獲得適當的限制進口，乃產生了限額合配制度——用直接的方法，限制進口貨的數量</p>
<p>第二，它並不僅僅乎實行進口限制的方法而已，它對於進口貨的數量或價値，從開頭起，便有一定的限制。因爲別用關稅爲間接的限制，究竟能限制進口數量到何種程度，是不能確定的；然而限額分配制度，則是參照某種商品的國內消費量與國內生產量，而後決定它的從外准許進口的數量。其决再對於此種已經決定的進口總量，考慮其如何分配。即（一）對外的分配——對於進口各國，按均等或按比例分配？（二）對內的分配——對於本國內的進口商人，如何決定其各個的輸入數量？（三）季節的分配如何將進口總量，適宜的分爲每月或每季的進口數量？以上各項，都不單限制進口數量而已，在限制之外，還加上一種分配的意味，所以被稱爲限額分配制度。</p>
<p>第三限額分配制度自從被使用以來，在許多國家都是利用法律的緊急處分，而爲臨時的施行。換言之，即不是法律事項而是命令事項。——這也是它的一個特點。向來用關稅以限制進口時，因爲關稅與租稅是類似的，（伸縮關稅除外）在原則上，要增徵關稅，是屬於法律的事項；但是限額分配制度，則並不要特別的立法，多是用緊急命令施行。例如：法國一九一〇年關稅法第三條所承認的緊急處分，即法國政府爲對抗外國政府一切足以妨害法國貿易的處置，有施行緊急處分的權力和義務。法國政府便依據這一條規定，對於許多商品實行限額分配制度。所以它大概都是附帶着期限，而爲一時的限制，大概最長不過一年。我們應當注意這一點，即限額分配制度，不過是一時的例外的緊急處置，並不是貿易政策上任何的重要變革；可是，現在却有不少的人這樣主張着。所以這種一時的緊急處分，頗有漸漸轉化爲永續的常設制度的傾向。</p>
<p>限額合配制度，在實行上，也有許多有關的問題：</p>
<p>第一：實行限額分配制度，是否與最惠國條款衝突。這在國際聯盟中，便曾經成爲討論的問題。——大槪須視限額分配的內容如何而定，有違反最惠國條款的，也有不違反的。例如：對於壤地粗接的國家，規定其陸路輸入的比率，對於遠隔的第三國家，事實上並不給與何等損害。又如，對於各國的進口比率，依照合理的過去的基準，而爲公平的比例分配，則在實質上，亦不能說是違背最惠國條條款。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕鄂省學生何國傑，因其妹何芳坽在鄂省立第二女師讀書，以證件不賣，開除學籍後失蹤，乃建議敎部，謂學校敎育廳以學業成續爲主，宜取銷證件制度。鄂賓敎育廳，因同時尙有學生七人亦因證件不實被開除學籌，懇請暫行留校附讀，特呈敎部請示。敎部令飭該廳，對失蹤學生何芳玲一名，黃成原校校長與該生家長共同探尋下落。至於其餘學生七人。證件不實，未便核定學籍，暫準留校附護，至學年考試及格，如可核定正式學籍。據某敎育家談：此一問題，値得硏究。如果某一學生，具有同等學力，成績優良，只因設件不實而開除其學籍，可說是合法，而不能說是合理。抗戰軍興以來，產生兩種學生：（一）家在淪陷區域內，不願肇業為校，在父兄或專師指導之下，　自進修者；（二）在學費極度高漲之際，因家清寒，無力求學，每於業餘自力修者。此二種學生之學力。往往不遜於學校出身之學生，惟其唯一缺陷，只是升學時證件不足，敎育當局為珍惜此輩好學靑年計，似有予以補救必要云。</p>

<h3>甲組足球第二循環戰　優游慘敗於猶太　四比一猶太報復首戰敗辱　十二碼優游得免全軍敗覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕足球聯賽甲組戰第二循環，優游以一比四慘敗於猶太，上半時優游連失四球，遂成不可挽救之局，下半時射中十二碼球，未吃鴨蛋，猶太得以報復首戰敗辱，逸園觀衆三千餘人，情况相當熱烈。</p>
<p>猶太佬　連中四球</p>
<p>雙方勢均力敵優游中重後調，後衛森嚴，而猶太亦有雪盤司汀及里士堡二後衛，益以麥尼蒂之鐵門鼎足而三，故雙方混戰一刻鐘之久，均無所獲。然因優游中軍後調，中路傳遞，失球累累，廿分鐘時，張榮廣救球心切，界內犯手球，猶太却畢斯基主罰十二碼，鵠中門角，一比〇猶太佔先。卅五分鐘時，猶太愛德華獨夫闖關，張榮才棄城來救，結果球竟慢慢滾入，優游又失一城，全軍散漫，猶太鮑傑乘機又來，成三比〇，前半時終塲前，張榮廣擅離職守，致遭愛德華再度攻入，前半時猶太以四比〇佔絕對優勢。</p>
<p>優游隊　打破鴨蛋</p>
<p>休息過後，易門再戰，猶太原班人馬登塲，優游則以曹琴芳任左冀，亞托瑪利任右內鋒，朱侮龍退守中路。接觸後，優游發動總反攻，二分鐘時曹老三單騎挺進，十五碼外叩門，爲麥尼幫接個正着，未幾陳効平於　區內倒地絆球，司脫侖有意斜射，致成野逸。十五分時雷樹萍殺入番兵帳前，卡普司汀救球心切，觸犯禁律，十二碼曹琴芳操刀，球從左角入網，一比四，優游打破鴨蛋。士氣雖見轉旺，奈麥尼蒂身手矯捷，一一化險爲夷。廿分鐘時，麥尼蒂抱球，連跑四步，判爲籬笆球，曹老三主罰，球飛出界。此後雙方戰來頗爲激烈，番將愛德華數次挺進，均未得逞，於是氣上心頭，遂有粗魯行動，大受警告，時間完舉，猶太以四比一擊敗優游。</p>

<h3>籃球聨賽　華陽初敗於晨友　鐵路京敗於恩卡斯　強華女子勝女青紅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽，昨晚二塲，女子組强華以六十三比二十三大勝女靑紅，甲二組華陽首次敗於晨友，四十五比三十六，壓軸恩卡斯大敗鐵路京，四十七比十九。各塲戰况如下：</p>
<p>女組</p>
<p>首幕女子組强華戰女靑紅，曹家班大顯顏色，曼麗曼媞加上黄峻，三分天下，黄峻首建奇功後，分數扶搖直上，女靑紅僅由吳民爵擲進一球，首節强華以二十一比二佔光，第二節女靑紅仍未見起色，曾昭淸參戰，聲勢稍爲一振，前半時三十三比七。易陣再戰，女靑紅吳民爵吳漢蓮頗有點綴，然曹家班仍極猖獗，第三節五十二比十二，末節女靑紅加强防守，兩隊各得十一分，結果六十三比二十三，强華大勝。</p>
<p>甲二</p>
<p>次幕華陽逢晨及，雙方均爲甲二組中之常勝軍，故戰來緊張之至。晨友史久全首破籃圈，華陽季有崑還以顏色，於是此後兎起鶻落，互以一分上下，七比六，八比七，形勢頗爲緊張，終因胖子動作較緩，遂漸落後，上半時十七比十一，晨友佔先。易籃後，華陽益見落後，季有崑又因犯規五次提業，氣勢更挫，晨友黄存瑞王炳福近托遠擲，四十一比二十六，天下大定，胖子後勁頗充，惜時不我待，結果四十五比三十六，華陽首次吃敗仗。</p>
<p>一甲</p>
<p>壓軸戰，恩卡斯對鐵路京，鐵路蔣國平首罰建功，恩卡斯克羅斯基回敬二分番，將政勢猛烈，轉瞬以九比一佔先。鐵路京改以慢傳戰略對付，奈番將身長力大，鐵路京一籌莫展，前半時二十二比七，恩卡斯遙領。易陣交鋒，仍是番將天下，鐵路京僅由楊賢基略爲點綴分數而矣。結果四十七比十九，鐵路京慘敗。</p>

<h3>立信會計專校　在抗戰多難中孕育長成</h3>
<p>— 賈</p>
<p>立信會計師專科學校，是以潘序倫會計師所組織的立信會計師事務所爲火本營。　分爲二部份。補習學校成立於十七年春，已有二十年的歷史，但補習學校不便訓練高級人才，故有二十六年創設專科學校之議。</p>
<p>當時由陳其采王雲五二氏任正副董事長，潘序倫氏任校長，錢新之，江恒源，宋漢章，劉攻芸，吳蘊初，吳　梅，杜月笙，榮鴻元，章劍穏，查濟民，潘序倫，李文杰，錢迺澂，陳文麟，李鴻壽，王逢辛諸氏先後加入爲校董，以立信會計師事務所，所捐贈之立信會計業書版權値十萬元，中外圖書四千册，設備基金五千元及潘氏歷年執業餘款陸萬元爲建築基金，綜計逾十七萬元，爲辦理立信會計專科學校之基金。乃以八一三抗戰，遭逢首决挫折。及二十八年，滬市市况漸復，乃呈准敎部正式開辦，迨至三十年，舉行第一屆畢業典禮，又逢租界淪陷，再遭挫折。三十一年內遷四川北碚，經三四年之勞力，置校舍十幢，規模粗具。勝利後，應員來滬，房荒嚴重，首由潘氏將原有自置蒲石路四六六弄三層樓五開間洋房一幢，作爲臨時校舍，並就原置徐家滙校基，計劉與建校舍。現初步計劃，已見實現，計興建大小房屋四幢。</p>
<p>紡織樓與宗敬堂爲一座三層樓水泥鋼骨的建築，題名是紀念紡織業的鉅額捐款的，其中包括足容千人之大禮堂，及可容七八十人至一百四五十人之大小敎室十四間。又思源堂紀念立信同學校友之募捐熱誠，寓飲水思源之意。全部校基四十餘畝，各項建設，正在開展中，行見此一抗戰多難中孕育成長之幼芽，發育滋長，未可限量。</p>

<h3>魯西戰場三百里</h3>
<p>— 本掃徐州記者縱春林</p>
<p>徐州三日航訉</p>
<p>徐州三日航訊本報駐徐記者縱春林</p>
<p>正是大雪的時候，魚台，微山湖濱的一座古城，挺立在凜冽的朔風裏，雪瀰漫着，冰天緊鎖着。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，魚台曾經一度淪入共軍手裏，因爲當地的民衆受不了「扒路軍」的壓迫，曾經掀起了全魚台的反抗，那時武裝義民有兩萬多人，終於把魚台光復。在這以前，這縣城非常堅固結實，可是它已經統統被共軍拆毀了。</p>
<h3>魚臺　微山湖畔古城</h3>
<p>現在的城，是一個土圩子，由無數個小的碉堡聯擊成一座大碉堡，千千萬萬個射擊孔，像繁星一樣密佈在城週的圍牆上。</p>
<p>在豐縣以北，我們便嗅到「解放區」的氣息，領略到「解放區」的「德政」了。各村莊裹都冷寂的像一池死水，牆已倒，屋已塌，房子已被拆毀，門窗樹木也都一掃而光，甚至村裘的狗都統統被共軍打死，因爲狗已被認爲是夜間行軍的障碍物。</p>
<p>魚台，有一條東西大街，并不算很長，商店有兩百多家，但是都風燭殘年了，它窮困得像一羣垂老的病人，沒有一家能够開門的，因爲連他們僅存的糧食，破棉絮，破盆碗……都早已給「扒路軍一解放去了。</p>
<p>微山湖畔的這座小城，從前它是北方的天國，因爲湖濱的淤地，特別肥沃，農夫們可以不勞而檴。從前，這裹是麥倉，魚市，花生，豆油，棉花，湖米的出產地，每年的暮春三月，春風解凍，漁民們把貨物用小船運過來，運回去，還有時嬌陽初上，古路上行走的小伙子們，也快意的哼出一兩句他們慣唱的情歌，但是，現在一切都變了，都被「扒路軍」「扒」光了，「解放」完了</p>
<h3>方先　叱咤風雲</h3>
<p>沉毅，堅決，勇敢，方將軍是一位典型的靑年軍人。</p>
<p>似若大家對三年前的事情，記憶猶新，可以回想到日本人曾經調動了駐東北的關東軍，以疾風迅雷的壓倒優勢，進攻三湘。但在衡陽城，却碰了一個極大的釘子。那時我們的方將軍，整整的死守了四十七天，這震憾中外的史實，到現在還活鮮鮮的生長在每一個愛國者人們的心裏，</p>
<p>方將軍，個子很魁梧，臉上表情深沈，正與其堅毅性格相配合</p>
<p>他是徐州警縣人。「九里山前古戰塲」（白居勿詩）的徐州便生長了這位忠勇愛國的將領。他現在擔任徐州守備兵團的司令官，和整編第八十八師師長，只有三十多歲，黄埔軍校第三期畢欒生，和現在駐節濟甫的王耀武將軍是同期同學，而且是頂要好的朋友。</p>
<p>在他指揮部的小房子裹，有一幅條山，是一位詩人給　的：「丈夫貴氣濟，豈獲　一身，安得萬里裘，蓋裏周四垠，羅暖皆知我，天下無寒人」。</p>
<p>他是一位篤信基督的人，一本「聖經」正是他行坐不順的東西</p>
<h3>金鄕　山一樣的不動</h3>
<p>金鄉周國，和魚台城北的開國地帶，便是八十八　的弟兄，為了保衛國家，保衝大徐州，而會力奮門的地區。</p>
<p>共軍抄　土肥　的故技，企圖對徐州外國作　作鉛形次擊。劉伯誠和楊勇，率領三個縱隊和一個詼的兵力，根據俘　和情報的估計，約計三十個匯，還有同來的兩個僞專員公署，和九個僞縣政實，連同地方風隊，總數當在十五萬以上。</p>
<p>整整的一個月了，金鄕城還是園若金湯，整個八十八師的李文密旅長，苦據苦　，　金據的　眾勿，也都參加戰鬥，共軍從鉅廣，束明，東平，東河，寗陽，泗水，强迫科集了無數的老百餘，敎他們背着一捆高　柴去塡鍼壕，敎他們手上綁着一個　　　爬城牆，敎他每人扛着一個大手當去轟炸國軍的潤堡。</p>
<h3>星期論壇　向「自殺敎育」制度提抗議！</h3>
<p>— 張霆潮</p>
<p>關於重訂中小學課程標準的幾點意見</p>
<p>目前中國一方面是人浮於事，失業的人多得無可計數，另一方面却感覺到人才缺乏，不論那一種工作，要找一個勝任愉快的人才，往往不易其選，這種畸形的現象，究竟是甚麼原因？我們姑且把「奔走夤緣」，「任用私人」等惡劣風氣放開不談，事實吿訴我們，主要的原因還是在靑年們的學問不切實用，而學問之所以不切實用，都由於敎育制度之不良。試看每年成千成萬的中學畢業生離開學校，想到社會上去服務，他們中間不論是高中或初中畢業，即使程度很高，成績很好的，在實際上究竟可以擔任些甚麼工作？一切的一切不是還得從頭學起麼？程度差的，成績壊的更不必說了。「李白是明朝人」，「浙江的省會是吳縣」，那些笑柄不都是辦敎育者的恥辱麼？中學生如此，大學生又怎樣呢？說來眞够痛心，除了少數特殊機關外，一般普通機關大都見了大學先就頭痛。一紙文憑，一頂方帽子，把他們的身價抬高了，對於實際工作却一檄不通。照這樣子下去，不久的將來，敎育一定會破產，所謂「普及敎育」「培植人才」將永遠沒有實現的日子！</p>
<p>現在的敎育制度，行之已經二十多年了，所收的效果，大略已如上述。就拿課程標準來講罷，據說這標準當初是由敎育部會同了全國專家研討訂定的。我記得常這標準將頒佈未頒佈的時候，上海市敎育局曾經召集本市各學校代表分組討論，當時筆者也是代表之一，我一看了那課程標準便對生席說：「在逐項詳細儉討之前，我有一個問題—像這樣繁重的課程，對於學生的健康方面是否相宜？」而那位主席的答覆是：「這是敎育部特請專家訂定的，大槪不會有錯！」我聽了這句話，只覺得啼笑皆非，立刻退席。這不能責備這位主席先生，因爲全國各階層多的是這種人。其實所謂「專家擬訂」，不過是會集了幾個比較有地位的人，閉門相商，想到那裹寫到那裹，各憑各的理想，好高務遠，但求表面上好看，而是否可以實行，實行之後有甚麼利弊，一概不問。所謂「專家」呢，無非是幾位高級長官，加上幾個有來歷的留學生罷了！在這種情形之下訂定的課程標準，那就難怪他「無濟於用」了。所奇怪的，這許多年來，始終沒有一個人出來講一句話，坐視地學校敎育的日向下游，而不想加以補救。這至少證明了所有從事敎育事業的人們，都抱着「這是敎育部請專家訂定的，不會有錯」的幼稚觀念。現在許多人都高唱着「敎育第一」，可是照這樣因循下去，即使有經費，有人才，這口號終究不過是一個口號而已。所以我希望敎育部把中等學校敎育制度，澈底重加硏討，另訂章則，務使切合實際，適應環境，讓我們勿再聽見「讀書有甚麼用？」這種謬論。而所聘的專家，不一定是繪紳長官或者留學生，第一個條件是要在現行敎育制度之下至少確有十年以上敎室經騐的好敎師。</p>
<p>現行課程標準的最大缺點是：（一）多而不精，（二）忽視現實。照現行標準所規定這樣繁重的課程決不是天資平庸的人所能應付的，而敎育的目的當然不是專爲造就天資特出的學生，却在造或一般的人才，尤其是比較魯鈍一些的，因爲聰敏人到底是少數啊！決不該爲了適合少數聰敏學生的能力而犧牲了大多數天資較差的衆人，何况運用聰敏學生的才力，使他們不受愚鈍學生的牽累，自另有其可行的適當辦法（詳後），何必一定要削足就屨呢？試看現在每個中學生所要修的課程，有算學，代數，幾何，三角，大代數，解析幾何，生物，化學，物理，國文，英文，歷史，地理，公民這麼許多名目，而且都不是簡單淺近，相反的都是相當高深詳盡，別說天資拙劣的了，即使羅力在水準以上的，也感覺到應接不睱。結果，肯用功的，鎭年鎭日埋頭苦讀，但求應付考試，根本談不到興趣，更沒有機會在課本以外吸收一些應有的知識，甚至有把生命都葬送在書本裹面的。不肯用功的呢，望而生畏，對於這件多課程，根本絕望了，認爲決不是自己的智力所能對付，心一橫，索興置之不理，另向偏路上求出路。這偏路便是挾帶，抄襲，頂替等等不誠實的做法，比較規矩而不善作弊的學生，只好白費了多年光陰，中途輟學。難道這許多人，都是不堪造就之材麽？絕對不是，他們中間有很多很多天才卓絕，在某種學科上大可造就，大有發展的靑年，只因爲這許多繁重而不切實用的科目把他們緊緊的束縛住了，把他們登高的階梯阻塞了，千里良駒，終於「　死於　櫪之間」。這是國家的損失，敎育當局的罪惡，也是民族的羞恥！</p>
<p>講到實用吧！一般的說，全中國有幾個人能够受到高中敎育？高中畢業生在社會上該是奇貨可居了，然而事實上一個高中畢業生，無論農工商界，究竟在那一個部門裹可望做些切乎實用的工作呢？我敢大胆說，他們中間，能寫一張普通便條，稱得上淸順無疵的，已經是寥若晨星；初中畢業生更不必說了。其他像幾何，代數，生物，理化道一類東西，根本沒有使用的地方。也許敎育當局編製這樣課程標準，有兩種理由：（一）這許多科目，都是當議，一個高中學生，一個受過敎育的人廳該都知道；（二）作爲升學的準備，因爲各人的趣向不同，有的專修工，有的專修醫，有的政，有的農，不得不在每種學科上，打下一個基礎。關於第一層，我們不必拿理論來講，我們只要試找一位律師，請他解一個極普通的幾何或者代數間題，看他能不能　付。或者問一位醫師，平漢鐵路經過那幾個城市，看他能不能詳答無訛。解答不出，應付不了，我們很有理由說他們沒有常戲。可是事實上像這樣的常議全都具備的能有幾個？當初他們在學校的時候，一般的下過一番苦功，一般地經過幾十次考試，而且有的還得過獎狀，只因爲他們的　房裹久儲不下這許多材料，新貨一進去，存貨隨贛出淸，當初所下的苦功，統統付之東流，大部份的光陰等於盧擲。老實說，這出所謂言識，在一個學生踏進專門學校的門的時候，除了與她所修學科有關的科目以外的東西，早就忘記為一乾一凈，何必等到他做律師做醫生呢？編製課程標準的原意，希望每一個人能解般　分問題，結果連加减乘除都弄不淸，希望每一個都知道蘇州有個虎丘，結果連喜馬拉亞山都忘了。與其這樣以深書淺，欲詳反略，何不在大處要處多下些工夫呢？</p>
<p>根據上面所說，第二個理由——「為升學作準備」，不攻自破。旣然學生的志趣不同，專修的圖目各異，那末所謂「藝義」，「準備」，也得分個輕重。爲甚慶一定要强迫一個預備做醫生的學生，跟着大家在文學歷史上下工夫，一個做律師的人，在生物地理上下工夫？課程標準的不合理，就爲了要迎合這不合邏輯的升學考試。課程標準有澈底修正的必要，便是升學考試急需變通辦理的明證。况且升學的是少數，還有大多數不升學的又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>世界各國，尤其是中國，現在所迫切需要的，無疑是專『人才，這是鐵一般的事實。所以敎育當局的責任，就是趕緊製造這種專門人才—有根有蒂，學騐豐富的專門人才，不是徒知皮毛，有名無實的專門人，，更不是甚麽都曉得一些，而甚慶都不精通的馬浪蕩式的人才。那末爲甚麽要把靑年們求學時代的光陰，百分之八十犧牲在不切實用的「雜碎」學科上呢？假使再不改絃易轍，急起直追，中國將永久患着人才荒，即使敎育普及，至多也不過四萬五千萬個「馬浪蕩」罷了！</p>
<p>除了上述的弊病以外，現行敎育制度還有一種極大的缺點，就是學生們只知道在規定的課本裹捉迷藏，而在社會和世界的大園地裹，可以說眼是瞎的，耳是雙的，口是啞的，尤其是一雙手，簡直是有若無，實若虛，百無一用。一個弱不禁風的身體，更抵不住西風落葉的打擊。試問即使全中國每一個人多是這樣的大學生，對於社會國家究竟有甚麼好處？科舉時代的四書五經，八股文章誤盡了全國靑年，漸送了國家生機，這種愚民誤國的敎育，永遠爲國人所痛恨詛咒，想不到科舉廢了三四十年後的今日，所謂敎育，依舊是封建時代的愚民政策，把這許多不切實用的書本，塡鴨式地儘向靑年們的頭腦裹塞，再加上左一個考試右一個考試，這重重的壓迫，使得學校，學生，都是暮氣沉沉，連一個透氣的機會都沒有。這種敎育是「自殺敎育」，非儘速加以澈底改革，中國將永無進步的希望！</p>
<p>籠統的說起來，現行敎育制度是把學生完全放在被動地位，他們祗許接受，不許自發，對胃口的東西固然要他們吃，不對胃齋的東西也得硬吞下去。在專門學校的周圍砌上了銅墻鐵壁，成了極少數人的禁，再在每個學生的頭上加上一個金鏡，除了跟着唐僧走，休想越雷池一步。我眞不懂，那些巍峨煊赫的所謂敎育大家，到底把敎育兩個字當甚麽解釋？是否以爲唱唱高調，玩玩公文，就算了事了呢？還是眞的不知敎育爲何物物，不知道中國所需要的是怎樣的人？如果是屬於前者的話，那我無須多說，這奔騰澎湃的民主洪流，遲早終會把這些時代的渣滓沖洗盡凈。如果是屬於後者的話，我還存着一錢希望，希望他們放棄「故步自封」的劣根性，把這旣倒的狂　，設法挽回一下，救救國家，救救靑年！</p>
<p>我沒有後台，所以稱不上專家；不是專家，便沒有「擬具方案，以供參考」的份兒。不過我憑着數十年學校敎育的經騐，目擊學校敎育之瀕於破產，雖然爲了生活的壓迫，一年前脫離了敎育界，然而心所謂危，不甘長此統默，大略提供幾點意見，藉以引起社會賢達，敎育先進的注意，進而督促政府，「勒令」改進，那末拋磚引玉，對於敎育的前途，也就是中國的前途，說不定大有裨益哩。</p>
<p>現在的所謂受敎育，總是：朝晨挾了書本上學校，進敎室，坐在那裹靜聽敎師講解，講來講去，逃不出敎本的範團，這謀一運三個　頭，吃中飯了，飯後再是這據三價　頭，就此各各分散，學校就算是　了好的責任，學生和敎員算是做完了一天的工作。天天如此，月月如此，年年如此，直到畢業。如果這樣就算是敎育，那未免把敎育二字看得太簡單了。任何人不都知道德智體羣四育並重麽？然而偈這然的學校敎育，除了培植「書蠶」以外，還有何「育」可言？我以爲：第一，此後的學校敎育，應該减少敎室鐘點，坩加課外作業。在敎室裏面，敎師只處於指導地位，課本只是一種敎導的範匯。一個敎師貴在能引起學生硏究的興趣，使學生能把一切言論理想表現於事實。現在中國說大話，發議論，講大道理的人固然不少，而目光如豆，不知社會國家世界爲何物的，允是多得不可勝計。眞正能够領導羣衆，實事求是，脚踏實地做事的，眞是千中少一。要矯正道個弊病，須先打倒已往的塡鴨式敎育，而致力於增强學生的自動力，養成他們的合作習慣和服務精神。在課程方面，鼓勵他們自由閱讀，自由發揮，自由寫作，尤其要注重實騐工作，儘量利用環境，和現有的器材，作爲實騐的工具。最可笑的，有許多學校，甚至於把化學物理之類的課程，也常作了「文學」課程看待，依文講解，照公式潰繹，沒有半點實騐工作，眞可說是荒天下之大唐了！在修養方面，應該隨時隨地矯正他們的奢華，處浮，欺詐，怠惰等習慣，准許他們自由開會，自由結社，舉辦各種競賽，獎勵服務工作，學校裘的用具，儘量由學生自己做，淸潔工作由學生自己理，此外像園藝，音樂，美術，義務學校等等，都該列入正常學程之內，由敎師負責指導，隨時考核成績，因材制宜。敎員在敎書和批閱課卷以外，尤其應該深入學生羣中，和他們多接觸，多來往，隨時注意他們的言行，個性，特長，隨時加以指導，褒獎鼓勵。說到這裹，「師資」就大成問題了。優良的師資，不一定是大學畢業生，留學生，或者碩士博士之類，最重要的還是在操守方面，必定要心地光明，沒有時下惡習，可能以身作則，才配做敎師。像現在有不少敎師，把學校當作政治活動的根據地，或者把牠當做暫時棲身的擺渡船，或者不求前進的養老院，甚至有的在學生身上轉鈔票念頭，也有和學生結爲酒肉朋友，以圖耳目口鼻之娛的，不問他們的學問怎樣了不起，壓根兒不配做「人師」。當然要求優良的師資，第一先要提高敎師待遇，這裹不過就事論事罷了。</p>
<p>第二，在課程編製方面，應該注意實用，一方面要顧到各級學校的畢業生在社會上多少可以做些實際工作，另一方面使有力量再求深造的可以升學。學生的健康問題尤須特別顧到，小學發育未充，更加應該多活動，少讀書。所以小學課程應該儘量减輕，我認爲應修的課程只須四種：國文，數學，常識，勞作。平均每天在敎室裹的時間，不得多於四小時（高年級不妨酌量稍稍增加）。英文根本不須要，因爲小學生一年所讓的一些英文，大概中學生一個月就可以讀好了，而且這一些英文，假使小學畢業之後，不再升學了，根本毫無實用。國文的目標，只要能看得懂報紙，自己的意思可以用文字達得出，所佔的時間至少該是全部課程的三分之二。數學只要把「四則」學得又精又熟，百分之八十以上的時間，該化在數字上，儘量减少應用問題，比較艱灤和需要溧思的問題，應該絕對摒除。常議包括史地理化，只要一些極普通的綱領，愈簡愈好，而且大部份可以包括在國文裏。臂如地理，只要世界上有幾個洋，幾個洲，幾個大國，中國分幾省幾市，幾條主要的鐵路山脈河流，和袖們的位置，全國主要的出產，甚麽呌地球日球月豫，這幾項已經是足够了，不過一定要不憚重複，他們牢記在心，對答起來，和回答自己的姓名一般熟才行。</p>
<p>初中課程仍舊以國文數學爲主，英文常識爲附。國文的目標，在提高思想，充實資料，實用方面在能發表意見，普通魯札文件都能應付，數學注意實用算學，諸如損益，利息，度量等等，數目不妨繁冗，問題務必直載，目的在求演算迅速準確，輕快流利，其他若代數幾何，允貴淺近精熟，切忌深奧。英文除訓練發音準確外，敎以基本文法，尤其是字典的運用，養、成自修的技能，着重簡易文句的構造，根絕死記章則定義等惡習。科學史地，仍舊列入常識範圍，但舉其落落大者，較之小學課程，不妨略增一二，却仍以精熟爲主。</p>
<p>高中絕對必須分科，除國文和外國語規定爲普通必修科外</p>
<p>（本必高深，非文科學生不必研究舊文學），其餘的按　分配，大概可分工程，數理，商業，法政，醫藥，文學六系，第一年偏重基本學科，第二三年專門學科。除文學，法政，數理外，應儘量减少理論，注重實用。譬如一個公式，不必細究牠的來源，但求能够運用自如。此外每個學生應選修一種隨意科像速記，打字，圖畫，書法，音樂第。每一高級中學至少須有二糸，牠應有的設備和學生的分配，必須要有明確的規定。</p>
<p>這樣，在學生的出路方面，一個小學畢業生，如果出來做一個公司行號工廠的學徒，至少懂得書算。一個初中畢業生做些抄寫，收發，記賬，校對，普通信札等工作，至少也可以自立。高中畢業生更是學有專長，只要政治上軌道，不愁沒有出路，比之現在的大學畢業生，相差大槪不致於太遠了。只要經過短期的實際訓練，縱不能做工程師，做一個監工技士之類却可以應付了，縱不能做法官醫師，做一個書記官或是護士總够資格了。至於高中畢業之後，要繼續升學的話，大學人學考試的科目，當然也應該和高中所修的課程分類銜接，另訂標準。高中旣然分科，大學專修科的程度也可以提高不少，而在實習工作方面，更可以增加重量。</p>
<p>依照上述的辦法，也許對於少數天資特出的學生，似乎是太輕鬆些。如果道句話可以成立的話（事實上是不成立的，因爲學問不會厭其太精，而且讀書以外，應該學習的東西正多着），學校當局可以酌量情形，准許特升，一方面節省他們的光陰，同時也是一種極好的獎勵辦法。說到這裹，我們該聯想到現行敎程的嚴格限制了，——沒有初中畢業證件不能投考高中，沒有高中畢業文憑不能投考大學，非經學校當局的證明，不能轉學，這些和其他很多不合理的限制，不知道使多少靑年失學，使多少家長呌苦，使多少天才埋沒！敎育當局定下道種規矩，究竟根據甚麽理由，殊令人莫測高深。如果國家眞要普及敎育，造就人才，這種荒謬絕倫的限制，非剷除不可；否則無異用敎育自殺制度來戕賊人才！</p>
<p>現在的學生還有一件極痛苦的事，這便是應付考試。拿一個高中畢業生來說，在他畢業的前後，先來一决大考，有些學校還要另來一决畢業考試，接着又是會考。在投考大學的時候，爲了自留退步，至少得投考兩處。這樣在短短的大的一個月裘，他得應付五决考試，每天埋頭在緊張氣氛裏，而且時候剛剛在暑期，烈日當空，炎熱鬱悶，這種制度實在近於殘酷。除非政府承認學校敎育沒有上軌道，否則該承認這些考試都是矛盾的。學校旣然是政府核准設立的，那末這學校的畢業生，當然是合格的了，那曉得政府却不予承認，一定要來一次會考。畢業考試及格了，會考及格了，分明是有資格進大學了，大學偏又不予承認，還是要經過一决考試。直截痛快的說一句，這分明是政府自己不信任自己，結果害得學生徒然吃苦，否則三决考試併成一决，又何嘗不可？可是這話又得說回來，以前有許多中學生，在會考裏鬧出許多笑話，像上面所述「李白是明朝人」，「浙江的省會是吳縣」等等，都是會考的煌煌成績。像這樣的學生，結果當然是不准畢業。也許因此有人說：會考所以不能廢止，不過旣然有了會考，那末學校考試該是多餘的了。同時學校方面准許這樣遠在水準以下的學生畢業，參加會考，分明是辦學不善，誤人子弟，應該嚴加取締，決不能含糊過去。而歸根一句話，還是課程標準不合理，政府不能辭其咎</p>
<p>最後，我要喚起國人同情的是學生們太不注重體育。中國人的體格，平均都在外國人之下，而且差得很遠，當然食物營餐是一大原因，可是缺少運動，實在是一個無可否認的主要廠結。一方面由於課程太繁，另一方面由於環境不良，以致大多數的學生不是弱不禁風的白面書生，便是意志頹喪的懶惰蟲。所以急應把課程减輕，由學校訂定辦法，强迫學生多運動，使他們對運動發生興趣。這不但有助於體格的健全，而且可以避免他們耽於不正當的娛樂。</p>
<p>上面所說的，不過用來供作改進學校敎育的一個議題。現在乘着敎育部正着手重訂中等學校課程標準的機會，把他提出來和全國關心敎育諸君子商討一下。至於詳細實施方案，和其他急需改良的許多問題，都有待於敎育常局和敎育「專家」們的大才斟酌定奪的了。</p>

<h3>混亂的一週</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>上週市場，極度混亂，一般生產事業竟有無所適從之感。照這個局面，預算無從確立，生產無從計劃，實在不是好現象。</p>
<p>本來中國的生產事業，首先受到國外製成品低價傾銷的影響一蹶不振。在勝利之後生產用品進口極少，銷費用品進口較多，因此成本增加，出口難與舶來品競爭。現在混亂情形，如果不早日停止，前途困難，將更為嚴重！</p>
<p>投機取巧，祗圖自利的心理，應即消除，但最大的前提，還是在於政府的早日澄清。</p>
<h3>挽救蠶絲業</h3>
<p>— 任衝亮</p>
<p>去年工商各業，一片不景氣之聲，尤以蠶絲事業，千瘡百孔，虧蝕特鉅。整個絲業有總崩潰之趨勢。雖政府鑒於蠶絲事業在出口地位之重要，實行收買蠶絲，但因收買範圍，僅限於貸款所繅之生絲，且中蠶對於收買價格，非常嚴格，廠商尚感不敷成本，去年秋季，又以天氣關係，秋繭收成惡劣，原料匱缺，以致多數廠家，均已於去年年底告一結束。無錫絲廠數十家，今年開車者，僅「永泰」「嘉泰」「美新」三家，但無錫乾繭存量，據熟諳是業者估計，尚不足供三百部車廠家維持至新繭上市期。故今年之絲廠，大部分將被迫停車，直至廢曆五月。然接新之後，瞻望前途，亦殊不容樂觀。蓋日絲之競銷，因為致命之打擊；「尼隆」「人造絲」之發明，尤為影響絲業前途榮枯之根本原因。前因後果，錯綜複雜。茲特將蠶絲業對於農村之重要，及挽救之道，就鄙見所及，略述如下。</p>
<h3>黃金時代　國產絲與日絲抗衡</h3>
<p>我國自有蠶絲業以來農民利用農事餘隙，種桑養蠶，天時地利，均所適合。江浙農民賴是以為主要之副業。惟因國人墨守成法，不求改進，以致出品惡劣，海外市場，反為日本搶奪。戰前，少數先覺份子，大聲疾呼，力求改進，故民廿五六年時，其出品已可與日絲相埒。不幸抗戰軍興，僅存基礎，幾盡為日寇摧殘，巧敗垂成，良可惋惜。勝利以還，以外匯與物價之脫幅，工資之高昂，外銷之呆滯，絲業一蹶不振，造成今日可怕之蕭條局面。</p>
<p>查蠶絲事業，對外足以換取外匯，對內足以繁榮農村，與國家經濟命脈，息息相關，自不能隨其自生自滅。挽救之道，約有數端：</p>
<p>（一）育蠶之改良　日本之乾繭三百斤，即可繅製生絲一担，我國照去年所收原料，須六百斤方能繅製生絲一担。照目下繅絲成本，原料約佔全成本十分之五。故同一之機械人工，以同一價格出售，在日商已可有利可圖，在我則尚須虧本。故原料惡劣，實為我蠶戶與絲廠虧蝕之一大原因。戰前永泰絲廠等有鑒及此，首先實行「共育催青」，創辦養蠶合作社，訓練拔術人員指導村民育蠶，結果成績優良，農民產量增多，廠商繅製容易，繅拆减低，品位增高。廠商育戶雙蒙其益。故關於養蠶合作社，允宜首先恢復，以期繭品質佳良，成本减减低。</p>
<h3>今後改進　以日本為競爭對象</h3>
<p>（二）改裝日本最新式繅絲機械　我國多數繅絲機械，大都為一種老式之坐繅車。有「多條式」立繅車者，已寥寥無幾。一般廠商，大都資本短絀，狃於近利，故不求改進。以立繅繅絲機與坐繅繅絲機化較，其成績約可高出坐繅十分之七。然立繅繅絲機，與日本最進步之機械比較，出數相差又幾達一倍。故當務之急，宜速派蠶絲導家赴日，學習是項機械之製造及繅製，反而為國人倡導，始克臻功。</p>
<p>（三）工人之訓練　去年本市合　製絲所，曾請未撤退之日籍技師來廠參觀。據該技師談，日本從前以此種立繅車工作時，（指合豐之立繅多條車）成績尚可高出若干，足見工人之訓練，尚未能盡善盡美。而日本女工之服務精神，尤可欽佩，增加工資，輒能顧慮到廠方之成本。反觀我國工人，工資越多越好，對於廠方之是否能維持，絕不顧到。殺雞求蛋，此種觀念一日不割除，則蠶絲業之前途，必有自趨滅絕之一日。</p>
<h3>人造纖維　也應着手研究了</h3>
<p>（四）人造纖維之研究　溯自「尼隆」人造絲發明以來，為時不過八年，但進步一日千里，據本刊某君尼隆製造法一文，內載有，美國社邦公司年出人造絲二千萬磅，可製絲襪四萬五千萬雙，銷路驚人。故上海自尼隆絲襪侵入市場之後，國產蠶絲絲襪銷路大减！尼隆之慢於天然絲，不辯自明。尼隆係科學之產物，進步一是千里。反觀蠶絲方面，因有天然之條件，其進步必不能與蠶絲並駕齊驅。以育蠶之改良為例，乾繭達三百斤繅製生絲一担，已為最進步方法育成之繭，苟發奮而研究之，二百斤繅製生絲一担，或亦屬可能之事。但苟欲一百斤乾繭繅成生絲一担，此乃絕不可能之事。故研究人造絲之製造，亦係刻不容緩之事。是乃不可抗衡者。若固執於育蠶繅絲一項，不求人造纖維之研求，則無異以卵敵石必有破碎落伍之日。</p>
<p>總之，目下蠶絲業挽救之道，原料，機械，人工三項均須力求改進。以日本之現存蠶絲業為參考。而人造纖維之研究，亦屬不容緩，蓋如此方能適合「巧奪天工」之科學原則也。</p>
<h3>僱主的心理</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>一椿事業的成功，得力於職工的努力的成份不少。欲求職工努力，僱主必須深懂用人之道。不幸大部份的僱主都昧於此道，以致所經營的事業，不能臻於成功之境。現在將一般僱主所易犯的，較大的錯誤略舉兩端，以資參考。希望僱主們留意一下，對於自己的事業的發展是有很大的幫助的。</p>
<p>有些僱主對於勤奮的職工，雖然在背地裏或心裏加以讚美，可是總不肯當面對他們讚賞。吝於讚賞的僱主的心理是惟恐對職工加以讚賞後，他們就會聯想到較大的薪水。</p>
<p>僱主的讚賞對於職工是極大的鼓勵，他們將因而更加勤奮，工作効率大增，即使多領一些薪水也是受之無愧的。</p>
<p>一個有特殊的功績的職工，對於僱主是有極大的利益的。僱主因此而賺錢，在此情形之下，祗少功績要歸於那位職工的。但是有一種僱主却對有功績的職工加以妒忌，竟用「有我才有店，有店才有你」的邏輯推論出，「你的功績實際上是我的功績的表現」的結論。</p>
<p>這種僱主太短視了。職工因此而懊悔，為什麽不勤吃懶做呢？並且常會激怒他另圖發展，擇木而棲，這對於原僱主是極大的損失。</p>
<h3>一架立式繅絲機</h3>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>二，合作精神</p>
<p>要使職工增長他們的服務時期，首要問題，是雇主與職工之間，要有合作的精神，在普通一般情形之下，雇主與職工是處於對立的地位的，雇主以為職工是機械性的，並不能了解他們的真價值，在職工方面，以為雇主都是唯利是圖，而以職工作為一種生利的工具。雙方有了這種心理。就不能談到合作了。所以要談到合作，那末先要去除這種心理，在雇主方面，凡是能力所能辦到的事情，凡是可能的時候，就立刻施行，使職工方面可以心悅神服，這一種精神的表現，應該由雇主方面多加注意，設法實行，並且最好不時有這種精神的表現。</p>
<p>這當然也要看企業組織或工廠的情形而定的，如果本身的情形很好，那末就容易實施，萬一企業本身的情形很壞，如遇到市面不景氣，或本業無從發展，或受時局影響，一時不能進行業務，那末在雇主方面，就有力不從心的苦痛，但即使在這種情形之下，也應該開誠佈公地和職工們說明，使他們了解而產生同情，從前電影中有「偉人安迪生」那部影片，當時安迪生因為發明沒有成功，欠了別人的債務，祗能躲在桌子下面，他也沒有力量分發薪俸，因此祗得解散他所有的職工，但那些職工都能够明瞭他的困難，願意不拿薪俸為他做工，這一種合作的精神，是很可以使人感動的，但凡事事在人為，尤其是處理人事方面的事務，祗要有那一種動機，就可以實行的。</p>

<h3>文以人傳</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>人以文傳的，的確很多。有些立德立功的人，為了也能立言，就此流芳百世的，固然不必說；而窮儒寒士，甚至鄉曲細民，既沒有赫赫之功，可以震動一時，也沒有巍巍之德，可以領袖羣倫，只為了他有著作，或者多到等身，或者片言隻語別有動人之處；於是也為人所看重，立於不朽之林。因此，我們這個稽古右文之國，千百年來都重視文，大家除了以之獲取功名以外，有的著書立說，有的吟風弄月，都希望自己藉此垂之久遠。他們就祗在文上用工夫，他們確想人以文傳。甚至有些其文不佳的人，能够在大文豪，大詩人的集子裏被引證一二句，留下一個名字，也引以為榮。人以文傳，成了極普遍而又極堅固的一般信念。</p>
<p>但是奇怪，我們看看現在所流傳下來的著作，到底多不多呢？這些希望流芳百世的文人，到底我們知道了多少呢？雖然一部四庫全書，也可以說汗牛充棟，但幾千年來的流傳，不應該只有這許多吧！當然，歷代的變亂，使書籍散失，是一大原因，然而有許多書籍，何以又不會散失呢？秦始皇的一把火，到底無奈伏生的記憶何，也終於不能消滅漢代立於學官的民間獻書者。這是鐵一般的事實吧！隨國詩話之類所推崇的詩人，我們到底有幾個是耳熟能詳的呢？看這些詩話的人，一遇見這些詩人，也只當他們是過眼的雲烟吧！因此，我不能不說，這到底不是人以文傳，而是文以人傳！</p>
<p>是的，文以人傳。惟其是立德立功的人，所以他的言也能立岳武穆並非文學家，何以他的「滿江紅」詞連小孩子都會唱呢？惟其是無德無功而又禍國殃民的，雖然他的文字妙盡妙絕，如秦檜嚴高之流，他們的文字有幾個博古的人看見過的呢？此外，我們不妨將中國一部文學史，略略檢視一下，其中著名的文人，有極壞極壞的壞蛋在裏面麽？我想沒有。曹操固然為「亂世之奸雄」，然而也確實是「治世之能臣」，他可以算為著名文人之一。王安石到今日已經真相大白，他到底不是「辨姦論」中的人物，他的為著名文人，也是毫無愧色的，果然在他生前，就也成了著名文人之一。所以古今著名文人，要說個個都是立德立功的人，當然不可以，風流誕放的，迂拘頑固的，或某事未能盡如人意的，當然不乏其人，然而，只要他「大德不逾閑」，自然「小德出入可也」。這樣的人文竟以也許傳起來，却總不能推翻文以人傳的定理，因為他果然壞到極點，我相信：不是文學史上沒有他的名字，便是他的作品隻字都不能流傳下來！於今居然流傳下來了，當然他不是頂壞的人，而我們如果去查考一下他的生平，也恐怕正是如此，他的流傳下來是公平的，如果他的文也的確好。這還是文以人傳！</p>
<p>我這樣說，不是想發一些空議論，矜奇炫博，或者拾人牙　，誇為獨得之秘。這些話原是大家都知道的。我的意思只是想提醒一聲今之為文人者，不要拚命在文字上用工夫，却忘了做人！「人生於世」，做人第一要緊！人而不能文，終不失為人；文而不成人，將為什麽呢？</p>
<p>我也不是叫今之文人，一定要為了其文之傳，才須好好地做人，似乎好好地做人便是為了其文之傳。這種沽名約譽的行動，決不能使其文有價值。我只是說，好好地做人的人，如果有文，其文必傳，用不着顧慮，更不必將文之傳不傳放在做人之先。文即使不傳，又有什麽要緊！人總是做成功了！</p>
<p>更加壞的是：為人之道既已置之腦後，便連文字上的工夫，也毫不講究，却一天到晚只想以文出風頭，博功名富貴，更想獨霸文壞，流芳百世。我真為他担心：他終不能傳；即使能傳，恐怕正是「遺臭萬年！」</p>
<p>那末，我們應該做怎樣的人呢？又怎樣做法呢？這個，我想你也是曉得的吧，用不着我多說，是不是？</p>
<p>作家趣事</p>
<h3>大仲馬</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>大仲馬（Alexancre　Dumas　1803－1870）是法國的富翁作家，他也很慈善，常常把錢財分散給一些窮人。他又是一個多產的作家，有一年，他竟出版過四十册小說。但據說：他的作品有許多是抄襲偷竊和別人代寫的，他開過一個「小說製造廠」（Fiction　Factory），廠裏僱了二百多個工人製造，他自己就是指導和監工的工頭。</p>
<h3>江南書簡</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>鄉居懷念着你，真有「恩君令人老」之感，昨日接到你自渝來書，回憶極多，猶記得去年冬天住在渝郊紅岩邨的時候，每天坐在嘉陵江邊看着靜靜的流水，幻鄉繽紛，鄉思纏綿，天天，想念着兒時江南，我底可愛家鄉，春天來了以後遷住市區神仙洞，有一天晚上偶然翻翻舊籍，忽然翻到姜白石先生底一首好詩說：「笠澤茫茫簑影微，玉峯重疊護雲衣，長橋寂寞春寒夜，祗有詩人一舸歸」那時候全重慶正當一片大江東去之聲，祗有我還孤另另的住在神仙洞畔，讀了這首小詩真是百感交集，根觸萬端，恨不能插翅凌空，乘風歸去，但誰又想得到一年以後的今天却又孤另另的在江南鄉間天天懷念着「何當共剪西窗燭，却話巴山夜雨時」的天富之國，人真是個何等勞碌的生物。</p>
<p>如今也用不着再抱着一束荒蕪的詩稿去向誰泣訴，不過今夜昌着風寒與夜露，獃呆的站在你底門外，請打開你底門來，我將帶着十年的花與愛情到你心的深處去，十年以後才明白，痛苦是人底惟一貴顯，為着要編織我生命底神秘的冠冕，即使像古代棕　城散逸的珍飾，不知名的純金，和海底的夜光，任令你親手採來，也不够織就這冠冕底華嚴燦爛。</p>
<p>這些日子我底秩序已經穩定，一些思想，一條嘆息的小河……</p>
<p>歌德先生在一八三一年重登伊門腦山巔，驀見他三十八年前在這裏留下的詩句，曰：「俄頃，你也將安息了…」他老人家忍不住流下淚水來，因為這時候的歌德，真如他底少年戀人夏綠蒂所說的：祗能望到最後的報償——死，也就是把偉大的自然化成火熖的最後一幕，乘上他所歌頌的「精神的車」而羽化登仙，歌德——這位永久美學的大父親，最後終於殉於他所信奉的神——自然，人生，藝術，完全化成了一束火焰，這個犧牲，這個身殉，是多應使人感動的。</p>
<p>近來夢想更多，想北碚風光，想譬山鄉情，想昔日少壯，想嘉陵江秋日行吟。</p>
<p>我總是寂寞得要命，像失去了知覺似的寞寂，我需要說話，需要有一個善全的心靈容納我底愛情，想從這陰森森的早晨，從這寂寞的時辰向你說一點希望，如果我們能隔着重重的山水，日月，星辰取得一點可憐的呼應和回聲，在亮着炭火的爐邊在寒夜的風雪中，你底聲音和笑貌常在我身邊盤桓，我好像每天都可以見你底發光的眼睛，聽見你底否看Soprano的華美的歌聲，還記青木間底聖誕之夜，我們兩人悄悄走向松林崗路上的携手和心跳？還記否溫泉底日光下的回眸和淺笑，這些都像烟一般散了。</p>
<p>如今我底財富也僅僅是這麽一點點語言，我愛牠們，庇護它們，儲蓄牠們，要使牠們成為我落難日子裏的忠心僕役。</p>
<p>你來信說：托爾斯泰是種音樂，他使罪犯懺悔，使作惡的向善，使慳吝人　為慷慨，……我佩服你抒情得可愛，你又說托爾斯泰像一座莊嚴的大山，你在努力爬上他底峯巔，在我認為他不僅是一座大山，而且也是一種心懷，就看你有多少誠懇，多少仁愛去接近他，去爬上他，去呼吸生命高空的隆重的大氣，每種努力，每個步驟，都是一種圓全，都是一種佔領，最前的和最後的都是同樣的香客，誠心一致，意志聯結着意志，如托翁自己所說，神之王國不在天上，在於人類自己的心裏。</p>
<p>讀你底熱情的來信，使我非常感動，祗要我們能有誠懇和公愛的努力，宛如身處晨光朝霞之中，滿身全是莊嚴和希望。</p>
<h3>風箏</h3>
<p>— 翟放</p>
<p>童年的故事，隨着風箏的記憶又在隱約的顯現了。</p>
<p>記得幼小的時候，每當春天的陽光，不惜犧牲地播送給大地上的人們的時候，和煦的風拂着人們的衣裳，我們一羣跑上那朝着陽光的山崗上，作一次最偉大的「風箏」比賽。看誰的高，誰的遠，還有誰的講究。有時一不小心，風箏的綫斷了！斷了綫的風箏徐徐地下降，而我們的頭上的汗珠也不住地流；大家迫呵追，追過了溪水上的木橋，越過小小的山崗，跨過遼闊的田埂，又作了一次更偉大的賽跑；大家　尋着那一只斷了綫的風箏。尋到了後，又將綫結起來，讓它再到春天的陽光裏去沐浴，冲刷落地後沾上的泥土，……我們一羣又開始唱着歌子：</p>
<p>風箏飄！</p>
<p>風箏高；</p>
<p>誰個遠，</p>
<p>誰個高？</p>
<p>昇起來，</p>
<p>更昇高。</p>
<p>今天，我推開了窗子，遠眺着天上的風箏，在春天的陽光裏翱翔。藍色的天際，白色的風箏，多麽美麗，多麽詩意！然而我只得孤仃地憑窗羡慕。童年的故事換來了一個沉鬰的回憶啊！</p>
<h3>雪　（攝影）</h3>
<p>— 趙澄</p>
<h3>記金松岑</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>金松岑先生是死了。</p>
<p>當報端報導他的死訊的幾個鉛字，躍進眼簾時，我懷疑怕不是真的吧！因為任何一個和他老先生熟識的人也都認為最好不是真的。可是，他終究是死了。</p>
<p>一副厚花眼鏡，是那麼莊靜而即之溫然的學者，我永遠記着，同他共事的一個時期，雖然這時期太短暫了，他是光華的中文系主任，我們知道，光華以「文學」鳴於時的，這扢揚之功就完全出諸他的一手。所以，當時張壽鏞校長非要他出來不可的。他很熱忱，如果被關懷的學生，幾天沒有碰見，便記掛着：「為什麽不見，不知進境怎樣了？」那時我在「大夏」只兼任了光華「中國文學批評」一課，每星期跑兩次，但差不多常到他那兒去，他的房間，祖孫倆合住着，也因為孫兒在校念書，而他老眼中很寶貴這第三代，據說同鄉康成之于小同一樣，手文似已，才屈就了這一席的。寇氛侵進這僅有的租界一角，他就帶小同順鄉間了，光華在改名分地的潛藏策略下維持着絃歌，然而他無論如何不肯再踏上這塊土。</p>
<p>在鄉間，他吟詩自遣，當然，文字的流露很容易指為犯罪的，而平凡的風月之句，又不是一個在野的憂世之士所甘為。於是，他把帝的東西來引喻，寫出滿胸的積憤，這樣，不失其風人之比興。曾經寄過我很多長句，尤許登在我編的「今人詩文錄」，都是偕題諷刺時事的，如「驚蛱蝶」，「獅鬚裘」等。很抱愧，那時不敢全登出來，他的原稿，是安徽通志館的稿紙，一直到現在還珍留着我的篋中，末一首針對着敵寇的，這裏把它錄下來，讓我們瞭解這艱貞學者的忠忱與卓見，詩題：螺螄吞大象。（自註此山谷詩中語）</p>
<p>「象王生是渾勃族，只有象齒美勝玉，螺螄旋掩本小鮮，咀嚼憑人棄溝瀆，巴蛇古有食象志，三年出骨盡其肉，法螺亦集龜　羣，力弱未許扛大陸，蜿蜒爬上軸心去，老羆獰笑勾留住。蠻腰素口一溫存，正是梟雄姦絕處，情瀾妬火雙前熬，和戰關頭百慮焦，草閣臨江三度卸，泥螺槃辟渚蝦跳。」</p>
<p>他的詩，古風最勝，同樣，古文浸淫直駕於歐柳之間，他自己也這麽說：「章太炎以後，不作第二人想。」這確不是自負的話，不過一邊屬於隱潛守默而已。現在，先生去矣，誰又能溯承流風呢！</p>
<h3>踏雪尋梅</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>提起了梅花，使我們產生了一種高標絕俗，玉潔冰清抽象的美感。他為詩人所歌詠，名士美人所贊賞，畫人墨客所描寫，在朔風凜冽的嚴寒中，凝芳吐艶，疏影橫斜，獨標了風格。他象徵一個守樸存真，偉大而崇高的人生。</p>
<p>住在江南的人，祗曉得杭州的西溪，蘇州的鄧尉，無錫的梅園萬頃堂，是梅花集中的香雪海。可是遼遠的地方就無人注意了。人間天堂，四時氣候溫和的昆明，我曾觀賞過唐梅宋柏，玉樹瓊枝，嘆為觀止。去歲參殘冬臘月，我適在故鄉　縣，曾踏雪尋梅，到西郊幽徑，通過一座　麗綪工的太平石橋，瞻仰一代詩宗的太白褸，入西千風景區，經數道曲折，達到梅花古衲墓道，雖無梅林香雪海之盛，却也老幹鐵枝，可算百年古樹，其上就是長慶塔和披雲峯，我在朔風怒號，滴水成冰的山麓寫成殘雪稿本，得慶此行之不慮。</p>
<p>「出汚泥而不染，濯清漣而不妖，」這是周敦頤愛蓮花的評語。「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山。」和「菊殘猶有傲霜枝。」這是田園詩人，淵明陶潛所持的風格，「衆芳搖落獨鮮妍，占斷風情向小園；疎影橫斜水清淺，暗香浮動月黃昏。」這說明了林處士所以要愛梅花的原因。但是梅花的本身感想如何呢？容我將唐詩人王淇的詠梅詩寫在下面，作為本文的結尾。</p>
<p>「不受塵埃半點侵，竹籬茅舍自甘心；</p>
<p>只因誤識林和靖，惹的詩人說到今。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血164</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「〇四」剛去，鶴見似乎又想起了什麽，立刻向　羣和我們道歉了一聲：「對不起」，便直趨電話所在，呌起號碼來。</p>
<p>我一聽號碼，知道他呌的日本潛伏在北平的軍部總辦事處，換句話，就是特工駐平總部。耀羣和小老虎不懂日文，都楞着一雙圓眼珠子，呆呆的瞧着。</p>
<p>「不管事態如何，只要問清了他呌吳鼎元，瘦瘦個子，三四十歲，北平口音，多半西裝，也許化裝，工程師，以前在長辛店，現在有些精神病，不管事態如何嚴重，我要這個人，不能損傷一點！」</p>
<p>這是鶴見電話中的字句，很像一道特殊命令。鶴見僅僅一個新進上校，有什麽權力，命令松井和酒井？這呌做「在京和尚出外王」，况且近衛重視鶴見的情形，不出二十四小時，軍部和特務機關頭腦，只要不是一隻呆鳥，早已打聽明白。鶴見等級雖說不十分高，國內國外是十二分吃香的。</p>
<p>這個電話出去之後，鶴見才感覺安定了一些，耀羣，小老虎和我，同時舒了一口氣。尤其是耀羣，經我把鶴見電話中的辭意，大體譯出之後，臉上才略略恢復了些顏色，同時那對剪水雙瞳，發出異樣欣悅的光彩：</p>
<p>「古先生，您真是古道熱腸，這樣愛護朋友。」</p>
<p>「不，吳先生此去，等於自殺，我料想他是去復仇的，殺日本人，您想辦得到嗎？至於我本人作事，耀小姐，您慢慢會明白，我究竟是怎樣的一個人。」鶴見不知為了什麽，面頰上竟泛起了一片紅色。</p>
<p>「別人也許不知道，我可不能不明白您的為人；不過今天的事，應當看作例外，其中厲害不是太大了些嗎？」「厲害」二字，是指鶴見不顧本身嫌疑而說。耀羣說到這裏，臉上也泛起了一層紅暈。</p>
<p>這時小老虎，張着兩隻大眼，骨碌碌地忙得厲害，從鶴見臉上看到耀羣臉上，又從耀羣臉上，看到鶴見臉上。</p>
<p>這是屋子裏又靜默了起來。</p>
<p>「小姨，您不是還有話嗎？」小老虎竟衝破了這靜默的氛圍。看樣子，他是鼓足了勇氣，才敢發言；因他說話的時候，兩隻手攢成了緊緊的兩隻拳頭，好像預備拚命似的。</p>
<p>耀羣被小老虎這們一提醒，才如夢方覺似的！</p>
<p>「哦……！岳先生，」她冲着我微微一笑，「乘古先生也在這裏，我想跟您提一提。我同虎弟從協和出來，順便　到北京飯店，凑巧見着張金龍，就是請到通州帮忙的那一位。我告訴他，我同虎弟，立刻要上潼關，或娘子關這一帶去了。問他能不能設法火速通知寨子裏一聲，問問咱大爺，能派多少人去帮忙。……」</p>
<p>「這事w君已經通過了嗎？」我插口問了一句。前幾天從通縣回來，收到鶴見的密電，一面盼望我到日本一走，一面又說，蘭組土肥原預備積極進入山西，呌我也準備移植山西。我把這話向w君提過，但未有具體討論移植計劃；却沒想到耀羣和虎城，把這事實地進行起來。所以我聽了她向寨子裏要弟兄帮的話，便問她是否已經通過了w君。這，關係着兩個問題；（一）耀羣和虎城，已經加入了w君的組織，諸事要聽命令行事；（二）行動必須經濟和器械兩種供給。這不是一二人的行動，可以隨隨便便的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>敬老大會</h3>
<p>— 心耳</p>
<p>據報載，說是瀋陽又在「敬老」了。又是舉行了「敬老大會」。據說是到有七十一歲以上的老人九十一人，並請九十五歲的老人王錫候為壽星，還贈送各人衣料一件云云。</p>
<p>「敬老大會」，也舉行得多了。如閉目一想，華顛籠鐘，羣老畢集，其態可掬，一定頗為好看的。這個年頭，人命似草芥，活下去已經為難，活得老自然更不容易。不說砲彈忽然自天而降，即是安然浸在黃水裏或安然吃草根吧，總不見得是延年之道。竊以為「敬老」之由，實在是頗為深長的。</p>
<p>救濟人員一跑到災區去，看到平民都面黃肌瘦，立刻下成斷語曰：缺少營養。於是弄一點罐頭牛奶或奶粉去，名之日救濟。「救濟」與「營養」相對，不免有些——上海人打話尷尬吧？然而這些營養實物却又會在半路失踪。看樣子，中國人在水裏浸浸，吃吃草根，已成習慣，說不定真能熬鍊成一付銅筋鐵骨來，不是我們的學者已發明「中國人是天生能吃苦的民族」的學說了嗎？這些年來，我們還是處處「敬老大會」，「人生七十古來稀」，早有成語，本來如此，應該稀奇的。但這是不是與銅筋鐵骨有關，則一時不得而知了。</p>
<p>中國平民活滿三十歲的便成為新聞人物，大抵我們總不希望有這樣的日子吧？</p>
<p>除此之外，也實在再想不出「敬老」的道理來。如說活得長便稀奇，稀奇而已，何須要敬呢？如果這個人有事業文章，寓國利民，那麼就是不老也值得敬，又何須待其老？又如果這人不過白活了快一世紀，過的寄生生活，胃囊中塞足了燕窩白木耳或維他命丸，真所謂「飽食終日，無所用心」，因此而活得長，下焉者更弄得混身是病，濃痰滿地，仗人服侍而活下去，更何值得去敬？（湯禮和鄭孝胥敬不敬？）</p>
<p>「敬老尊賢」，「古有明訓」，但那「古」是什麽時代？沒有像今日那麼多的金條，那麼多的燕窩白木耳。禮運大同　還是現在的政治理想，如要敬老，我想在實現了這個理想之後，是不會嫌遲的。現在來對一把白鬍子焚香三叩首，說得實際一點該是「慶」吧？</p>
<p>科學智識</p>
<h3>碘與偵探</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>碘Clodine的用途，除去化學教本上所載的幾項以外，現在又可以用來做偵探的工作。凡隱藏的指紋，以及偽造或塗改的紙票等，都可利用牠偵探出來。手續非常簡單，但先要曉得碘的製法。</p>
<p>工業製碘法，從前都以海藻灰Kelp為來源，現在大部分則仰給於智利硝石Chile　saltpeter。至於家常要取碘做試騐，可用碘酒（是碘溶化在酒精中而成的），只須從中將酒精提去即得。其法先將碘酒倒入一大玻璃試管中，然後用燈漸漸將管烘熱。待酒精完全蒸發後，則管中放出一種氣體，色如紫茄，味臭刺鼻。這就是碘蒸氣的特徵。碘蒸氣很重有毒不可嗅吸，牠一到平常溫度時，就成為固體，其性質和氯氣類似。</p>
<p>碘蒸氣一接觸到試管上部的冷壁，牠就在那裏凝成固體。這樣從固體不經過液體而直接變為氣體，再從氣體而直接回復到固體的碘，用化學的術語來說，就呌「昇華」。</p>
<p>碘可做「化學偵探」的試騐。此種「化學偵探」上所需要的碘，不是固體的碘，却是紫色的碘蒸氣。試騐時，將我們的手指在一張白紙上一壓壓後，紙上當然看不出留着什麽痕跡。但若將此紙和碘蒸氣接觸，則指壓處就會現出指紋來，非常清楚，若將剛才被手指所壓過的紙收藏起來，等到數月後來試騐，碘蒸氣仍能將紙面上隱藏着的指紋顯出。</p>
<p>碘蒸氣又可用來偵查偽造物，凡未觸過的紙，和用橡皮等擦過的紙，或乾燥的紙和經水濕過而後再弄乾的紙，都可利用碘蒸氣在紙上所顯出的顏色來判別。就是不鋒利的東西在紙上所作的痕跡，也可以用同法來顯出。</p>
<h3>失火</h3>
<p>— 助譯自Esquire</p>
<p>「聽說貴廠火燒了是不是？」</p>
<p>「是啊！損失很大呢！」</p>
<p>「貴廠出品的是不是引火物呢？」</p>
<p>「不是，是滅火機。」</p>
<h3>春晨之窗（一）</h3>
<p>— 伊凡</p>
<p>每一間屋子有它自己的窗子，迎接春晨；每一個人也有他自己的窗子，迎接春晨。</p>
<p>你每天早晨打開了屋子的窗子，打開了你自己的窗子，看看這個大都市：這不過是春天嗎？一點也不像吧？</p>
<p>着頭彩</p>
<p>好新聞：「四大名山賊黨，來滬活動落網」，假冒空軍長官的劉航俠，據供是現年廿一歲，是其中的「參謀長」，普於民國卅年春，在重慶市陝西街美金市場盜竊行政院長宋子文美金票三萬元。</p>
<p>宋子文，美金票，而且是三萬，比着什麽頭彩都强。</p>
<p>神童讚</p>
<p>可是你可曾算一算，那時這位劉航俠君不過十五歲吧，普通的孩子大約正在初級中學上學，而他却已做了「參謀長」，雖然不見得有什麽任命狀之類。</p>
<p>他是奇才。先生，你以為如何？</p>
<p>毀天才</p>
<p>因此，對於路局警務處的破獲工作，就不能不表示扼腕了。他們毀壞了天才。</p>
<p>劉君的才能倘若發揮下去，一定有超過三萬元美金之類的成績的。</p>
<p>譏迂腐</p>
<p>不消懷疑，還有人因此會論教育問題的。那麼我預先說一句：這位先生迂腐透頂，他這人的一生，在中國可算已經完了。</p>
<p>不可兼</p>
<p>住在對過的一位朋友又在發牢騷了。</p>
<p>他本月收入廿萬元，但他有一個大計劃：本月份除開買兩担米外，再買一雙新皮鞋。看看這兩天的物價，十分憂愁，說是計劃破產，新皮鞋要落空了。</p>
<p>這個人多笨，難道赤了脚就不好吃飯嗎？我可打賭，到月底，他這廿萬元還可以買米來吃的。</p>
<p>顧前後</p>
<p>還有一層，也可以證明此人之笨。活該愁煞。因為他對過去與未來都沒有想得周全。</p>
<p>拿了現在的月薪，他可以設想是生活在一年以前的春天，收入廿萬元等於收入三十担米。就會很開心。</p>
<p>以此類推，他還可以設想是生活在一年以後，他這些錢只能買到一斗米的可能。那麼現在可以買兩担米，豈不賺得很多了嗎？也會很開心的。</p>
<p>效文豪</p>
<p>而且這個人顯然決不能做文豪。</p>
<p>譬如巴爾札克。他可以自己簽一張空頭大額支票藏之於自己的荷包，儼然以為自己很闊，招搖過市。——闊佬也不過是多一張支票而已。</p>
<p>學學文豪吧。</p>
<h3>一九四七年　美國人的流年</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>贏得和平的機會幾何呢？</p>
<p>你在一九四七年中會遭遇任何一件事，這在數學上是可能的。你可能得到一百萬美金，但是機會不易遇到；你也許可能死去，不過這機會也難得。</p>
<p>給你一個今年機會的數學觀念，幸福雜誌選了很多普通的和不平常的，但可能遇到的事實；這裏也列舉了許多你在戰時不能買到的東西，今年你可以計算你的機遇去把它買來。</p>
<p>當然，這些數字不是絕對的準確，譬如說罷工能影響了整個的貿易機構，不過這裏所舉的種種機遇是完全根據已知的事實—包括政府的統計和作家的意見，如失事的機遇是根據保險公司的統計，你去買一輛新汽車的機會是根據它的生產數字。這裏是一九四七年的：</p>
<p>婚宴</p>
<p>假使你已結婚了，你在本年度得到一個孩子的機會是十二分之一，今年在全美的產嬰數字中，將有九十分之一是雙胞胎，八千分之一是三胞胎，六十萬分之一是四胞胎。</p>
<p>因閃電而死亡的機會是三十五萬分之一，今年全美將有四百人死於閃電中。</p>
<p>死亡</p>
<p>今年死亡的平均機會是九十四分之一：如果你在二十歲以下，死亡的機會是一百九十分之一；二十歲至四十歲是二百六十分之一；四十歲至六十歲是一百分之一；七十歲以上則是十三分之一。</p>
<p>夜盜的機會是四百二十分之一。</p>
<p>溺死的機會是一萬九千分之一，前年（一九四五年）美國人因此喪失生命者共七一五零人。</p>
<p>入獄的機會是二百七十分之一，在一九四四年下獄的共四八八九七六人，今年的總數必將提高。</p>
<p>車禍</p>
<p>汽車失事的機會是三千四百分之一，在一九四五年的總數是二八六零零次。</p>
<p>自殺的平均機會是一萬分之一：如果你的年齡在二十歲以下，那末這機會是十萬零七千七百分之一。三十歲至五十歲是五千六百分之一。</p>
<p>跌斃的機會是四千九百分之一，今年將有二萬七千八百人因失足喪生。</p>
<p>失火的機會是一百零二分之一，在一九四五年中，三十五萬幢房屋受火災損傷。</p>
<p>橋戲中得全色的機會是六三五零一三五五九六零零分之一。</p>
<p>結婚的機會是九分之一，這雖然是根據年齡的，但在今年，三百萬的美國公民將結婚，同時有五十萬的嬰孩降生。</p>
<p>離婚的機會是六十分之一，今年約有五十萬對配偶將認為他（她）們的結合是錯誤的。</p>
<p>發財</p>
<p>獲得百萬美金的機會是二百十萬分之一，這個數字是根據去年美國財部的報告，祗有四十人凈賺百萬巨金。</p>
<p>買一輛汽車的機會是二分之一，美國汽車公司的生產已能供給這種需要。</p>
<p>其他日用家具：買洗衣機是二分之一；無綫電三分之一；電灶二分之一；冰箱二分之一，真空清潔器二分之一；全套的傢具二分之一。這些　示美國人的購買力。</p>
<p>建築一幢新屋的機會是十分之一，修築的機會是四分之一，（以上譯自幸福雜誌新年號）</p>
<p>但是，我們要問：這一年中美國人民贏得和平的機會又是幾何呢？</p>
<p>大小事</p>
<h3>國際地位考騐年　僑胞處處遭浩刦</h3>
<p>— 武弘</p>
<p>暹羅，　為中國的屬國，稱臣我邦，歲納貢品，後為英國所奪，現在雖已獨立，但仍受英國「保護」。這個昔與中國曾有「君臣之雅」的新興國家，對其「故主」，顯然懷有「舊恨」，不十分「親善」。對於華僑，一向懷着鄙夷輕視的心理，既加殺戮在前，復不准華僑受祖國教育於後，去年政府對此曾提出「嚴重抗議」，但暹羅却不予理會，一無結果。</p>
<p>暹羅警察總監，於本月三日接見中央社記者稱：「此間現有三百餘名華僑，等候交通工具出境；彼等大部曾犯「殺人搶刦」，「違反治安」等罪。其中若干名早應在上次戰爭中。即予以驅逐出境，惟因船隻缺乏，故　留迄今。……</p>
<p>不驅逐則已，一驅逐就是三百餘名，這是中國僑民在國外特受的「殊遇」，筆者據熟悉內情者言：這些被逐出境的華僑，大部份係於戰前因犯抗日嫌疑罪被捕，拘禁數載，祖國重光後，並未受到獎勵，此刻却被暹羅當局，冠以「殺人搶刦」，「違反治安」等「莫須有」的罪名，驅逐出境。</p>
<p>美國評論界曾言：「一九四七年為中國國際地位之考騐年」，這一個多月來我們所見到的是；和談渺茫，法軍在西沙羣島登陸；華僑在國外受到輕視，欺凌，「封鎖」驅逐。……這些「考騐」所得的「成績」，已經「洋洋大觀」，以後的當然可以想見。</p>
<h3>「可怕的半打」</h3>
<p>— 明桂</p>
<p>加州大學漢彌爾登博士，二月一日向美國物理學會報告：已發現六種新毒質，皆係由原子分裂而來的非氣體全金屬物質，為科學界所知毒質中的毒性最烈者。此六種毒質即「鐠」，「錢」，「　」，「鈰」，「銀」，和鐵的同位原素，故名之為：「可怕的半打」，　和鈾分裂時，都可以產生此六種毒質，但鈾的本身不如其產物之毒，此六種新毒質都是普通金屬，惟由原子分裂產生時，因係同位原素，發出幅射綫可歷數月之久。人類受幅射綫攻擊時，骨髓為其最大弱點，幅射綫殺滅骨髓，較殺峭其它組織為速，毒質侵入骨的裏層，就可達到骨髓。如與食物同吃，則並不運入血流，所以不能達到骨而排洩出體，並不為害。如果用噴霧法呼吸入肺，或使創口與毒質接觸，即可達到骨，而使人致命。</p>
<p>原子能的力量，能使人生，也能使人死，能醫療人類的疾病，也能毀滅人類的生命；能威脅和平，也能保障和平。利與害，有着絕對不同的效用，原子彈發明後，日本廣島十萬人的生命財產，作了第一次「實地試騐」下的犧牲品，也加速結束了戰爭，减少不少消耗。現在在製造原子彈時，又發現了六種烈性新毒質，不知又將有多少人的生命，在等待着做這六種新毒質的「實騐品」？</p>
<h3>殘廢人駕汽車</h3>
<p>— 高武弘</p>
<p>我們常常想：「一個靠拔術吃飯的人，如果成了殘廢，那怎該辦」？「一個駕駛汽車的司機，他的手萬一成了殘廢，改行又不可能，不是將就此賦閑，坐以待斃了嗎」？事實上，這種過去為人力所不能挽回的缺憾，在科學發達的前進國家中，是無時無刻不在設法以謀補救的。</p>
<p>據倫敦英國新聞處發表的電訊：英國某汽車公司為便利四肢殘廢裝有假手假足者駕駛汽車起見，經十個月不斷繼續研究，並聘請醫師及汽車專家作顧問，現已發明一種新型汽車，在車內裝有九旦機械，製成後由四肢殘廢的退伍軍人協助試騐，結果成績極為良好，行駛便利，一如導當車輛。</p>
<p>現此種新型汽車業已在英國大量生產，但目前因本國需要頗大，尚不直接受其他各國的預定。</p>
<p>過去所認為的難題，現在都一一迎刃而解，人定勝天，科學真是萬能的東西！</p>

<h3>Lunan Linyi Imminent; National Army Entering Xin Tai Advances Towards Mengyin; Fierce Battle in Recovering Ningling, Ydong, Taikang</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] After the National Army in Southeastern Shandong captured Laiwu and Mengyin Hanhou, they continued to advance. Xin Tai was recovered at 5:00 PM on the 8th, and Linyi is expected to fall soon. The two armies on the Longhai Railway are engaged in a fierce battle near Ningling, west of Shangqiu.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The National Army advanced to Fuzhuang and Dashagou, six miles south of Linyi, at noon on the 9th. The Communist army in the city has begun destroying buildings. The National Army is currently investigating the location of the Communist army's main force to engage in a decisive battle.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The National Army in Southern Shandong advanced to the outskirts of Linyi on the 8th. Furthermore, more than ten thousand Communist troops attempted to attack southeast of Tancheng on the 7th, planning to harass the National Army from the rear. The National Army and Hao Pengju's forces have surrounded them in the area west of Shizhai, Zhudun, and Huandunbu and are severely attacking them.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] More than ten thousand Communist troops who fled to the area south of Baitabu and Huandunbu are now heavily besieged by the National Army. The Communist army has suffered heavy casualties in recent days and is expected to be completely annihilated soon.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The Trained Army of Wang Yaowu's unit of the National Army recovered the filth of Xin Tai on the 8th and continued to advance towards Mengyin, the largest supply base for the Shandong Communist army. The Communist troops in the city are showing signs of wavering. Since the previous day, they have been transporting ordnance factories and ammunition depots to Yishui and Sishui. The ox and horse carts on the Yishui-Sishui road are arranged like a long snake.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] For the past two days, the National Army has been advancing towards Xin Tai from Laiwu in three routes. They engaged in fierce battles with the Fourth Division of the Communist Army, led by Liao Rongbiao, and the First Police Brigade, led by Liu Guozhu, in the mountains. By the morning of the 8th, the central route reached Mengyinzhai, fifteen kilometers from Xin Tai, the eastern route was south of Lishan, and the western route was fighting south of Huangyang Mountain. By 7:00 PM on the 8th, the National Army had entered Xin Tai, and more than ten thousand Communist troops retreated southward. Mountainous areas of the territory, reorganize and replenish. Furthermore, more than a thousand troops from the Communist New Eighth Regiment infiltrated Zhu Ji on the border of Shan County and Dangshan on the night of the 7th to cause disturbances.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist army, which infiltrated the Xiaoba area of Shangqiu, suffered heavy losses after being surrounded and severely attacked by the National Army in Liukouji, Zhangzhuang, and Chu Zhai for several days. The Communist army has now lost its combat capability, and its remnants have recently been broken up into smaller units, fleeing along the Longhai line east and west of Shangqiu, creating loopholes and destroying roads. The National Army is currently driving them out separately. Furthermore, passenger and freight trains between Xuzhou and Shangqiu are running smoothly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 9th] Tai was recovered by the National Army on the 8th, and the Communist army fled northward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] On the morning of the 9th, seven hundred Communist troops fled south from Zhongxingji, west of Feng County, attempting to attack our Zhou Sai. They are currently being surrounded and attacked by the National Army near Zhouzhai.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The Communist army in Southern Shandong concentrated the Fourth Division and joined forces to attack Hao Pengju's troops north of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. The town of Shahe, northwest of Donghai, has been captured by the Communist army. The Communist army intends to cut off the eastern section of the Longhai Railway again and flee back to Northern Jiangsu. The National Army is currently blocking them.</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Observer Discusses the War Situation: Southern Shandong Has Entered a New Stage</h3>
<p>The Communist Army Attempts to Cross the Jinpu Railway and Join Forces with Liu Bocheng's Troops</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] Since Wang Yaowu's large army in Central Shandong recovered Xin Zao, the overall situation in Southern Shandong has entered a new stage. According to a certain authoritative military observer: The Communist army in Southern Shandong, which is surrounded, could take the following five actions: (1) Escape to the mountains, (2) Defend Linyi to the death, (3) Retreat to Jiaodong, (4) Cross the Jinpu Railway and join forces with Liu Bocheng's troops, (5) Flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Among them, the first option was originally the most likely. However, since the National Army in the north occupied Laiyi, Xin Tai, and broke into the heart of the Shandong Communist mountain area, their attempt to preserve their strength and escape to the mountains has been eliminated. However, judging from the Communist army concentrating its main force to launch a fierce attack on Hao Pengju's troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the Communist army seems to be retaliating against Hao's betrayal on the one hand, and on the other hand, regarding Hao's troops as the weakest link in the National Army's entire line, so their attack is clearly an attempt to break through the encirclement and flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, Liu Bocheng's troops can once again encircle and attack Xuzhou from both sides in the north, and can still threaten Nanjing and Shanghai in the south. However, the National Army has taken strict precautions against this, and the Communist army's plot will never succeed. In this way, the Communist army's fifth attempt will also be in vain. The Communist army's strategic principle has always been to preserve its strength and avoid decisive battles, so the hope of defending Linyi to the death is also very small. As for retreating to Jiaodong, it is like a mouse burrowing into an ox's horn. Although it can be safe for a while, the Communist army will never take this step unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, according to the current situation, the hope of adopting the fourth option of crossing the Jinpu Railway and joining forces with Liu Bocheng is the greatest. The observer jokingly said that the news from various places recently claiming that the National Army has recovered Linyi is an unnecessary and excessive exaggeration. The National Army's greatest goal at present is to find a way to capture the main force of the Communist army and annihilate it in one fell swoop, so as to plan for long-term peace and stability. Otherwise, even if Linyi is recovered and the Jinpu Railway is opened, the problem cannot be solved as long as the main force of the Communist army exists.</p>
<h3>Communist Army's Aid to Hao Suffers Setback; Flees Back to Luyi and Zhecheng</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] (1) The Communist army that disturbed Hao County fled back to Luyi and Zhecheng. (2) According to captured Communist soldiers, the Communist troops fighting the National Army in Hao County and its northwestern areas were the entire Sixth and Seventh Columns and part of the First Column that arrived south of the railway on the evening of the 3rd, totaling twenty-two regiments and thirty-two thousand people. After several days of fierce fighting from noon on the 2nd to the evening of the 4th, the Communist army suffered about six thousand casualties, leaving more than two thousand bodies (in addition to more than two hundred prisoners). The Sixth and Seventh Columns suffered particularly heavy casualties, followed by the First Column. Among them, there was one injured brigade commander and one injured regimental commander, as well as many officers below the battalion commander level.</p>
<h3>Hao Pengju Expresses His Feelings</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] Hao Pengju recently sent a telegram to the military authorities here, expressing his feelings.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned Wang Yunwu and others for a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 9th, and inquired about the current domestic economic situation on the spot, and gave some instructions.</p>
<p>Dalian Armaments and Ordnance Factory is Already a Supply Base for the Communist Army in Eastern Liaoning; The Issue of Takeover Still Needs to be Negotiated with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Our Panyang Dispatch, 9th] A person from Dalian said that there are two large ordnance factories in Dalian, manufacturing rifles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars, and bullets, etc. One is controlled by the Soviet army, and the other is controlled by the Communist army. Therefore, Dalian is only a supply base for the Communist army in southern Liaoning and also a source of arms for the Communist armies in Jiaodong and southern Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] It is reported that the issue of taking over Dalian is difficult to realize in the short term due to the difficult-to-resolve prerequisites such as the economic cooperation proposed by the Soviet Union to our government.</p>

<h3>US Military Dependents Returning Home; Still Needs Some Thinking</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Amidst the voices of the US military withdrawing from China, US troops and their dependents in Peiping and Tianjin have been requesting repatriation. It is learned that the US military's sudden withdrawal this time has caused many personnel problems. Most of their dependents, who arrived in China last autumn, sold or transferred their houses or part of their furniture before leaving the United States, in preparation for staying in China for three to five years. Initially, they did not expect that things would turn out unexpectedly. In the current period of rising prices and housing shortages around the world, US military dependents will still need some thought after returning to the United States. After the US military withdraws, in addition to the personnel responsible for training work who will continue to stay, there is also a part of the population in the US military cemetery registration office that will also need to stay in China for a while until the task is completed.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Destroys Zhengtai Railway; Trains Between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan Suspended; Communist Army in Shaanxi-Gansu Border Area Continues to Harass</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] Semi-official news, the railway tracks near Shouchang on the Zhengtai Railway were destroyed by the Communist army. Passenger and freight trains between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan were suspended all day yesterday. The Railway Bureau has dispatched engineers to rush to repair them.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] According to a person from Taiyuan, there was recently a large-scale battle of two hundred thousand troops on the banks of the Qin River. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. It is said that the Communist army captured the filth of Xiaoyi, gathered twelve brigades, and planned to go north from Pingyao and Wenshui to capture Taiyuan in one fell swoop. Governor Yan, considering the seriousness of the situation, personally led eight brigades to supervise the battle in Pingyao. The two sides then launched a large-scale battle of two hundred thousand troops. After a week of fierce fighting, both sides suffered more than 20,000 casualties. The Communist army's offensive began to weaken, and the situation turned stable. Currently, the National Army is going north from Linqin and has reached Huoxian. Another unit entered Xiaoyi, and the Communist army was attacked from the north and south. The crisis in Taiyuan has passed.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] A certain military observer said that in order to open up the transportation line between Yan'an and the Northeast, the Communist army still has a tendency to invade Datong. The National Army is standing by.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 9th] The Communist army in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area has successively harassed Yijun and the north of Gouyi in the past week. Zhengning County was also occupied.

<h3>No Major Changes to the Organization of the Five Yuans; Initial Draft Has Been Prepared in Accordance with the Constitution; The Legislative and Examination Yuans Will Expand Their Scope</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] According to the initial draft of the organizational law of the Five Yuans prepared in accordance with the Constitution, there are generally no major changes compared to the current organizational laws of the various Yuans. The Legislative Yuan will still have one president and one vice president, who will be elected by the members of the Legislative Yuan. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan will increase from the current ninety-nine to about eight hundred, who will be elected by the provinces, cities, border provinces, overseas Chinese, and professional organizations. The term of office is three years, and they can be re-elected. Due to the increase in the number of members of the Legislative Yuan and the increased workload, the original plan was to increase the number of committees from five to fourteen. Later, because the work of the Economic, Labor, Civil and Criminal Law committees could be merged into other committees, it was finally decided to establish ten committees: Finance, National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Budget, Transportation, Posts and Telecommunications, Education, and Legal System. Its organization is determined by law. The Examination Yuan currently only has two institutions: the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Committee. It is said that a Civil Service Protection Committee will be established in the future to determine the civil service system. Furthermore, according to the Constitution, the Examination Yuan will have a number of examination committee members. Therefore, it is not certain whether the Examination Committee will continue to exist. In addition, the Constitution also stipulates that the selection of civil servants in the future should implement a public competitive examination system, and "those who have not passed the examination" shall not be employed. Since the business of the Examination Yuan has expanded, its institutions in various places must also be expanded. The organizational law of the Executive Yuan is not significantly different from that passed by the National Defense Committee last winter. The Ministry of Judicial Administration is still under the Executive Yuan. When drafting the organizational law of the Control Yuan, some people originally suggested changing the organization and functions of the local supervisory envoy offices, but it is said that the original state was maintained in the end.</p>
<h3>Regional Representatives to the National Assembly; Born Under the Constitution; Will Reach Two Thousand One Hundred People</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] According to authoritative estimates, the number of regional National Assembly representatives who will be produced under the Constitution in the future will reach two thousand one hundred. As for how the number of representatives from professional organizations and women should be determined, the initial draft of the National Assembly representative election law currently being drafted has not made a final decision. Professional organizations have previously suggested increasing the proportion of professional representatives. If so, the total number may be close to two thousand. According to Hong Lanyou's estimate, the National Assembly Hall can only accommodate a maximum of two thousand seven hundred people. Therefore, the venue for the next National Assembly meeting may become a problem.</p>
<p>[Central Stomach, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The National Assembly Resident Professional Representatives Association held its second meeting on the morning of the 9th, with more than fifty people attending. Li Hongru presided over the meeting and resolved: (1) To request the National Government to establish a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association as soon as possible in accordance with the preparatory procedures for implementing the Constitution to be responsible for promoting constitutional work. (2) The association will send a telegram on behalf of the Central Committee, the National Government, the Supreme National Defense Committee, and the Legislative Yuan, requesting that when formulating the next National Assembly representative election law, in accordance with precedent, professional representatives should account for 36% of the total number. Li Hongru, Tang Qiyu, Dai Tianqiu, Guo Heng, Zhao Xuan, Jiang Zhengxiang, Chen Huanzhang, and Chen Yixiu were appointed to explain everything to all parties, and were authorized to draft preliminary principles for the election law for reference.</p>
<h3>Constitution Regulation Committee; To Begin Work Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Legislative Yuan's Constitution and Law Regulation Committee will begin work immediately.

The main tasks of the committee are: (1) To draft laws and regulations based on the principles of the six organizational laws and four election and recall laws drafted by Wang Chonghui and others. (2) To revise various laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Students' Anti-Violence Association; Authorities Decided to Ban It</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] In Chongqing City on the 8th, the so-called Student Anti-Violence Joint Association launched a parade and publicity campaign at 10:00 AM. More than ten unidentified people participated. Their actions exceeded the scope of publicity and forced citizens to donate money. They verbally abused citizens who refused to donate as "traitors" and "foreign slaves," which aroused public outrage and led to conflicts and minor injuries. The public security organs are handling the matter in accordance with the law. In addition, the people affected in the ninth and second districts are filing lawsuits with relevant agencies.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Mayor Zhang and Commander Sun specially invited all sectors of Chongqing City at 4:00 PM on the 9th to report on the events. More than sixty heads of agencies and journalists attended. Mayor Zhang delivered a speech first, and then Director Ren of the Education Bureau, Director Tang of the Xi Shi Bureau, Director Xu of the Social Bureau, and Secretary-General Liu of the Provisional Headquarters reported successively. Commander Sun then announced that the Anti-Violence Joint Association was an illegal organization that had not been registered, and had repeatedly caused incidents and disturbed public order under false pretenses, and would be strictly banned. The responsible persons of the Dagong, Xinmin, and Central Newspapers also expressed their opinions one after another, which were summarized as preventing problems before they occur and guiding students to the path of the rule of law. Finally, Mayor Zhang expressed that the government must still care for students, and is determined to maintain the safety and order of the city, and hopes that the media will play a positive role in providing guidance and assistance.</p>

<h3>Supreme Economic Committee; The Legislative Yuan Still Insists on Abolishing</h3>
<p>The Case Will be Submitted to the Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the Supreme Economic Committee, when the Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget案 last month, it suggested that the committee and its affiliated import control committee be abolished because they had no legal basis. The authorities have not made a final decision on this matter. The Finance and other committees of the Legislative Yuan recently reviewed the organizational law of the committee again and still insisted on abolishing it. It is said that the case will be submitted to a joint committee for review. The draft organizational law of the Public Works Committee, which belongs to the Supreme Economic Committee, has also been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. In addition, the Finance, Economic, and Legal System committees of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to meet on the 11th to discuss the issue of the existence or abolition of the nine-member committee organized previously.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrendered, the Dalian was declared a free port, and Lushun was a naval base jointly used by China and the Soviet Union, as stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Looking back on the achievements of the Japanese in the past, we should make some active preparations before taking over Lushun and Dalian. Picture (top) Dalian's bustling street.

<h3>Import Control Committee Issues Statement; Refutes United Press's Criticism of the Committee; All Speculation is Absolutely Baseless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Provisional Import Management Committee issued a statement yesterday, clarifying some of the United Press dispatches issued on the 2nd of this month. The statement said:</p>
<p>"A dispatch from New York by the United Press on the 2nd of this month severely criticized the measures of this committee, saying: According to reports, the Import Control Committee is biased and unfair, uses political pressure, and allows companies set up by certain 'privileged parties' to take advantage of opportunities to engage in activities, etc. This committee firmly denies all accusations that this committee is biased and unfair, and delays issuing permits, intending to give assistance to those who attempt to 'monopolize the market.' This committee does not ignore the fact that some people use unethical methods to try to seize import profits from import business firms, but will take a firm stand to prevent such activities from taking effect. At the same time, all accusations that any person enjoys privileges for any reason and obtains permits from this committee are malicious slanders against this committee. This committee will never allow its staff to engage in any illegal activities. At the same time, it cannot tolerate any slander against the staff of this committee. It is especially warned to people from all walks of life and foreign manufacturers not to be deceived by such absolutely baseless accusations and rumors."</p>

<h3>Government Reorganization Becomes Increasingly Concrete; The Democratic Socialist Party Decides to Participate in the Legislative and Control Yuans; The List of Candidates for the Delegation to Beijing Will Be Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party has decided to participate in the Legislative and Control Yuans during the government reorganization. The list of candidates has not been specifically decided, but it will be negotiated soon. The list of candidates for the delegation to Beijing will also be decided within days. It is possible that Mr. Zhang Junmai will personally lead the delegation to Beijing. According to a responsible person, the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the government has two guiding principles: one is how to end political tutelage, and the other is how to narrow the gap between the government and the Chinese Communist Party, and ultimately create cooperation and unity among all parties in the country. At present, the second point is clearly difficult to achieve. Therefore, the purpose of participating in the Legislative and Control Yuans at this time is to complete the implementation of the constitution. As for the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, they do not intend to participate, so as to continue to promote China's democracy and constitutionalism as an opposition party. The Democratic Socialist Party will enthusiastically participate in future local elections. Furthermore, the method of participating in the government this time is a compromise decision made after considering various different opinions within the party, and it is believed that it will not be opposed by members in the north.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Government reorganization is becoming increasingly concrete. The reporter visited a certain member of the Democratic League today to inquire about their views on this issue. Their opinions can be summarized as follows: (1) The current method of reorganizing the government cannot end the domestic military conflict and is of no help to national affairs. Neither the Chinese Communist Party nor the Democratic League will participate. (2) In terms of external significance, what the United States is currently concerned about is that China can restore peace in order to facilitate the export of its capital and goods. If the government reorganization cannot achieve this goal, there are questions about whether the five hundred million dollar loan will be successful as a result. However, on the other hand, China's economic collapse is also not in the interests of the United States. Therefore, after the government reorganization, there may be economic assistance, but it will not be very generous. (3) In terms of internal significance, the question is whether the government's policies are innovative and whether it has the determination to improve administrative efficiency. The personnel of the opposition parties are not necessarily superior in quality to the current government personnel. Under the current political situation, it is also questionable whether the parties and social elites can play a good role in supervision after participating in the government.</p>
<p>[This City Dispatch] Mr. Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 7th to report to the party on the negotiations with the government on reorganization in Beijing. He is scheduled to go to Beijing again this morning (the 10th). It is reported that the list of the party's participation in the Legislative and Control Yuans has been taken to Beijing by Mr. Zuo for submission to the government.</p>
<h3>Temporary Japanese Reparations Plan: 13 Types of Industrial Equipment to be Removed First; Our Country Hopes to Obtain Half of the Total Tonnage</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to reliable sources in Nanjing: The Reparations Committee of the Far Eastern Commission has designated thirteen types of military industrial equipment to be removed first under the temporary Japanese reparations plan: (1) Thermal power plants, (2) Steel plants, (3) Shipyards, (4) Aircraft manufacturing plants, (5) Naval and army arsenals, (6) Acid plants, (7) *[illegible character]* plants, (8) Steel ball bearing plants, (9) Machine tool manufacturing plants, (10) Light metal plants (aluminum industry), (11) Privately-owned arsenals, (12) Artificial petroleum plants, and (13) Artificial rubber plants. According to estimates by the Japanese government, the total tonnage of the above industrial equipment is 12 million tons. Due to the wide variety of types, the Reparations Committee has not yet been able to decide on the distribution amount for each country. The U.S. government is considering, based on the actual needs of each Allied country, to first allocate a portion within the scope of temporary reparations to various countries. Regarding the quantity of the initial allocation, the U.S. side has proposed either 25% or 20% of the total amount of temporary reparations, while Allied countries have proposed 30%. As of now, nothing has been determined. The Chinese government, in light of the urgent need to restore domestic industry, has negotiated with the U.S. side based on actual needs, hoping to obtain half of the total amount of equipment removed in the initial phase, but there has been no result yet.</p>
<p>The Reparations Committee under our Executive Yuan has established six sub-groups: (1) Machine Tool Group, (2) Shipbuilding Group, (3) Steel Group, (4) Chemical Industry Group, (5) Thermal Power Generation Group, and (6) Light Metal Group, to separately formulate removal plans. However, due to the enormous cost of building factories, they are currently considering annual construction plans within the possible scope of financial capacity to coordinate with the utilization of the dismantled factories. Regarding the initial removal phase, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan has recently repeatedly invited our country to visit machine tool and thermal power plants for selection, and has provided 25,000 machine tools and 12 thermal power plants for our inspection. The inspection date may be around the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Looking at US-Soviet Relations from the Perspective of Disarmament</h3>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall held his first press conference on the 7th after taking office, during which he spoke freely about the US stance on the issue of arms reduction. The main points are five: (1) The goal we seek is to ensure peace and lay a solid foundation for collective security; (2) International control of atomic energy and other effective safeguards are of paramount importance. If atomic energy is not controlled, there is no security for mankind. We attach particular importance to the solution of this problem, and that is the reason why; (3) Any real reduction of armaments is difficult to achieve before a peaceful settlement in Europe and the Far East; Even any practical reduction of armaments is not possible; The US government will seek to avoid a repeat of the tragedy caused by unilateral disarmament and arms limitation after 1921; (4) The US will not reduce its forces until a collective security system is established; (5) If the US does not implement a conscription system, it will not be able to back up its foreign policy with its necessary military strength.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Secretary of State Marshall fully agrees with the disarmament plan proposed by Austin to the Security Council on the 4th. We review the full text of the US proposal, which can be summarized into the following three points: (1) To establish a Disarmament Committee, composed of all members of the Security Council, whose task is to submit to the Security Council implementation measures on the control and reduction of armaments and forces, including methods for effective safeguards; However, some issues that, according to the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly on January 24 and December 14 last year, should be under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission, are not within the scope of the Disarmament Committee's tasks. (2) To establish a Security Committee to make recommendations to the Security Council within the scope of the Disarmament Committee's duties, it should determine the relationship between the Disarmament Committee, the Military Staff Committee, and the Atomic Energy Commission. (3) When the Security Council decides to convene a meeting, it should immediately begin reviewing the first report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission on January 31 last year, and should pay attention to the recommendations made in Chapter 3 of the report.</p>
<p>This new disarmament plan is indeed commendable under the current international environment. Dr. Guo Taiqi, the representative of our country to the Security Council, first expressed his approval, saying that the US plan "particularly emphasizes the issue of international control of atomic energy and advocates giving priority to discussing the issue of atomic energy. The Chinese delegation will fully support it." That is, the Soviet representative, who stood on the opposite side of the United States, could not but express his agreement in principle to the US representative's proposal to establish a Disarmament Committee. However, Gromyko disagreed with the three points suggested by the US: First, atomic energy must be handed over to international control and a monitoring system must be adopted as an effective safeguard, and collective sanctions should be imposed on any country that violates the agreement. Second, the US limits the scope of the Disarmament Committee's duties and must not interfere with the scope under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission; Third, the US advocates discussing the issue of atomic energy first, and then discussing the issue of armaments. The Soviet representative disagreed with all three points. The US and the Soviet Union each held their own views and refused to give way, almost bringing the disarmament issue to a standstill and making it impossible to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Therefore, the French representative, who has always been a mediator, stepped forward to resolve the difficulties and attempted to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union, so that the Security Council could reach an agreement on the disarmament issue as soon as possible and avoid causing friction between the US and the Soviet Union again. The French representative, Maurice Couve de Murville, tried his diplomatic skills and actually achieved immediate results, enabling both the US and the Soviet Union to agree to use the draft proposed by the French representative on January 9 as the basis for discussion; the Soviet representative suddenly adopted a compromise attitude, which suddenly made the disarmament issue optimistic. As for the content of the French draft, the main points are two: (1) To establish a Disarmament Committee to submit recommendations within three months to implement the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly on the reduction and limitation of armaments; (2) The Security Council should review the international atomic energy control plan as soon as possible. The greatest feature of this draft is that it is a moderate compromise that can be accepted by both the US and the Soviet Union as a basis for continued discussion. After discussion by the six-nation subcommittee, the Soviet representative immediately expressed his agreement on three points: (2) To immediately establish a Disarmament Committee to begin drafting a plan for universal disarmament; (2) To immediately discuss the issue of international control of atomic energy; (3) To organize an international army as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Originally, the stalemate created by the US and the Soviet Union on the issue of arms reduction could be broken; however, the US representative Austin still insisted that the draft should stipulate a guarantee, that is, the Disarmament Committee should not intrude into the scope of activities of the Atomic Energy Commission. At the same time, the Soviet representative Gromyko also refused to be outdone and expressed his firm opposition, so the matter failed before success, and the disarmament issue fell into a stalemate, making it impossible to open up, and casting a shadow over the prospect of understanding and cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union. In order to break the current deadlock, Austin directly negotiated with the Soviet representative Gromyko outside the meeting, but the result was that Austin's efforts failed again because the views of both sides remained incompatible. At the same time, the six-nation representatives were also helpless and had to decide to submit the views of the US and the Soviet Union to the Security Council for discussion at a meeting this Wednesday.</p>
<p>The disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union on the issue of arms reduction and the failure to reach an agreement is a disappointing thing for the relations between the US and the Soviet Union, or for the peace of the entire world, especially for us ordinary people who yearn for international cooperation to jointly maintain world peace. Seeing the satisfactory conclusion of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second UN General Assembly in December last year, we were all overjoyed and fully believed that the international situation would gradually become clearer in the future. Not only the relations between Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union are expected to gradually improve, but also a true world peace after the war can be achieved this year, so we all hold full hope for the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference next month; but unexpectedly, on the eve of the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the US and the Soviet Union discussed the issue of disarmament and failed to thoroughly resolve this issue with the spirit of mutual understanding and concession. From this point of view, the possibility of improved US-Soviet relations cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Now, the disarmament issue on which the safety of the world depends will be publicly discussed by the Security Council again. We certainly hope that both the US and the Soviet Union can uphold the spirit of mutual understanding and concession and discuss this issue calmly. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 8th, the US is now carefully trying to avoid a "showdown" with the Soviet Union in the Security Council over the disarmament issue, which shows that the US is ready to compromise; as for the Soviet Union, although there has been no indication of compromise so far, the disarmament issue was first proposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, so he will not insist on his own views and allow this issue to remain in a stalemate for a long time.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Aid for Farming Revitalizes Rural Areas: Su-Ning Branch Office Plans for Distribution After On-Site Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Huaiyin Correspondent] Zhou Likun, a technician from the Xingzheng Yuan Su-Ning Branch Office, came to Huaiyin to investigate information related to agricultural machinery relief work. He convened a meeting with representatives from various agencies at the Huaiyin Relief Association on the afternoon of the 4th to discuss investigation methods, which were resolved.

<h3>Bandits Gather in the Countryside of Changshu: Garrison Troops Rush to Suppress at Night, Killing One and Wounding One on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Correspondent] The Qingxiang work in the three counties of Chang, Jia, and Tai is about to be expanded. The city defense youth army here received a report late on the 6th that the bandits of Lu Genxing's unit were gathering and gambling in the Nanhu area of Guli Town outside the Dadongmen, intending to stir up trouble. They immediately rushed to search and suppress them at night. They found a noisy crowd in Xu Xiaocheng's teahouse in Zhangjia Bridge and entered for inspection. Upon seeing this, the bandits extinguished the lights and opened fire at the flashlights of the youth army. The youth army immediately returned fire. The scene became chaotic, and the bandits fled in all directions. Wang Laohe was killed on the spot, and Lu Jinshan was wounded. Fifteen suspects were arrested and sent to the city for interrogation. At the same time, teams were dispatched to continue the search in order to clear away the bandit atmosphere. Meanwhile, the city defense headquarters announced that if there are lurking bandits in various villages, the heads of the Baojia and the people should be responsible for actively reporting and assisting in the suppression according to the law. Do not allow bandits to gather for meetings, disrupt public security, hinder Qingxiang work, and increase local suffering. If anyone is found to have seen bandits but not reported them or harbored bandits, they will be punished equally with the bandits and will not be pardoned.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Military Service: A Sergeant Cao Zheng Sentenced for Extorting Money After the Scheme Failed</h3>
<p>[Our Songjiang Correspondent] Tang Chengxi, a resident of Yexie Town in the county, was drafted into the army last year. Shan Liyan, who knew Tang, said that he could find a way to avoid military service. Shan then introduced Cao Zheng, a sergeant and clerk of the county security brigade. On November 3rd of last year, Tang's wife, He Qiaoyun, met with Shen and He at the Xinxin Hotel in the city. They discussed the matter. Cao would arrange for someone else to replace Tang Chunpei in military service for 15 shi of rice (equivalent to 700,000 yuan in national currency). He Qiaoyun paid 200,000 yuan in advance, with another 50,000 yuan for clothing expenses. The remaining amount would be paid after the matter was completed. Unexpectedly, Tang Chengxi thought of escaping over the wall at the conscription office on December 4th. Cao Zheng, claiming that 450,000 yuan was still owed, went to Yexie with Shan Liyan to demand payment from He Qiaoyun. He refused to pay because her husband had not returned home. She reported the case to the local police station for extortion and hindering freedom, and Shan was arrested and transferred to the court for interrogation. The court transferred Cao Zheng, who was an active military officer, to the county government's military law office for handling. The military law office sentenced Cao Zheng to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for eight years on charges of hindering military service, corruption, and hindering freedom.</p>

<h3>Highway Administration Bureau Allocates Funds to Repair the Ping-Zha-Jia Road</h3>
<p>[Our Pinghu Correspondent] The Ping-Zha-Jia highway, the main artery connecting this county to the outside world, has been closed since the 1st of this month due to uneven road surfaces and collapsing bridges, as ordered by Director Mian Li of the Construction Department of the Provincial Government. Recently, the Hangzhou Engineering Office of the First District Management Bureau of the Highway Administration Bureau, recognizing the importance of the highway and that it should not be closed for too long, dispatched Engineer Li to conduct a detailed survey along the Ping-Zha-Jia line with relevant personnel from the Transportation Engineering Office. After returning to Hangzhou, they quickly drafted the entire bridge and road surface repair cost, which requires 200 million yuan. The expenditure has been approved for full payment by the business unit and construction can begin soon.</p>
<h3>Robbers who Seized Guns in Zhangyan Apprehended in Shanghai: Jinshan County Government Sends Personnel to Solve the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Jinshan Correspondent] The No. 1 Company Headquarters of the Security Corps stationed in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, was attacked by bandits. Li, the magistrate of Jinshan County, was extremely angry about this unfortunate incident. In addition to strictly supervising the military and police to search and suppress the bandits in separate teams for days, he personally rushed to the scene of the incident to deploy everything, arrange informants, and send Captain Yuan and plainclothes officers to Shanghai to search according to the map. Finally, they arrested Wu Huanan, Zuo Shengnian, Wu Zizhi, and Zhu Guixian, Yin Jianming, Liu Jun, Liu Shilin, Dai Yongnan, Wei Huashan, Chen Yu and other gang members from Chaohu in two hotels in the south of Liangxi. More than ten confiscated machine guns were reportedly buried in Songjiang, and personnel have been dispatched to retrieve them. The rapid solving of this case has caused all the people in the county to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Fighting After the Dragon Dance</h3>
<p>[Our Wujiang Correspondent] Mei Shi Li, outside the west gate of the city, has always had a very strong folk custom. When things happen, fighting is the first premise. On the night of the Lantern Festival, there is usually a dragon banquet, which generally scares farmers. At that time, Shi Lai-sheng, leader of the tenth Bao of Shi Mei Township, led the dragon to add to the fun. When the meeting was dismissed, the dragons nodded and saluted each other. The southern dragon started fighting because the northern dragon was not polite enough. The whole group fought together. As a result, the northern dragon team was badly defeated and suffered many injuries. Among them, the young man Zhang Rongguan was the most seriously injured. He fell to the ground on the spot and lost consciousness. The next day, he was sent to the court to examine his injuries and was diagnosed with severe internal abdominal injuries, and his life was at risk.</p>
<h3>Bandits Harass Zhuangqiao in Wujin</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent] The eighth district of this county, bordering Taihu Lake to the south and bordering Xiyi, has always been an area where scattered bandits roam. Although the Taihu Anti-Bandit Area and local self-defense teams have repeatedly launched campaigns to suppress them, they have not been effective. On the evening of the 6th, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived in Zhuangqiao Town, Huangnian Township, in the district. They were in groups, carrying weapons, and were very fierce. They openly distributed leaflets and posted slogans in the town, and detained Shu Linquan, the chief of the fourth Bao, forcibly demanding 70 zu of rice. They were only released after others persuaded them and promised to pay them all over again. Later, the district learned of this and sent a team to pursue them, but the bandits had heard the news and fled far away.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Salt Freely Negotiated Prices: Ministry of Finance Approves Principles</h3>
<p>Highest price limited to rice per thousand salt shi</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The Zhejiang Salt Affairs Administration will implement free negotiation of prices at various important sites, instructing various salt farms to begin implementation in the middle of this month. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the production of salt in Zhejiang is closely related to the food supply of the eastern region. If it is not properly managed, it will inevitably be manipulated and affect the food supply of the people. Therefore, it has specially approved the principles and instructed them to be implemented. The important methods are that the salt produced by each salt farm must be handed over to the designated storage site and managed by the salt affairs authority. The price sold by the salt producers is determined by the salt affairs authority by convening salt producers periodically, announcing the price for implementation. The highest price is temporarily limited to rice per thousand salt shi. When salt producers hand over salt to the warehouse, they may be issued a part or all of the production loan, which will be returned without interest when it is sold. All salt producers should form an organization and elect a responsible person to represent the salt farmers in price negotiations.</p>
<h3>Girls Disappear: Happens in Suzhou for Days</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 9th] Recently, bizarre disappearances have occurred in Suzhou. The disappeared are all girls aged 14 or 15. There have been as many as five reports to the police station for investigation in the past two days. It is feared that there are still unreported cases. The police authorities are now paying close attention and believe that it is a planned action by abductors. They have ordered their subordinates to arrest and rescue them, and hope that residents will not let girls go out alone.</p>
<h3>China Silk Company Donates Mulberry Seedlings in Haining</h3>
<p>[Our Haining Correspondent] This county has traditionally relied on rice, silk, and tea as its main industries. After the war, the tea industry was declared obsolete. The silkworm industry was also in a state of decline due to the destruction of silkworm farms in various villages by the enemy, resulting in a sharp drop in production. The Fifth Silkworm Industry Promotion Zone requested relief from the China Silk Company in order to revitalize the silkworm industry as soon as possible and increase farmers' production. The China Silk Company has approved the allocation of 3,000 dan of Guang mulberry seedlings, 190,000 Japanese mulberry seedlings, and 40,000 Zhejiang mulberry seedlings for free distribution for grafting rootstock to quickly create mulberry orchards and benefit silkworm farmers. The county government has been instructed to have various townships and silkworm farmers' cooperatives quickly estimate and report the required quantities. Public and private silkworm farming institutions can also apply to the local silkworm industry promotion center or improvement zone for registration and collection.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Rewards House Construction: New Houses Exempted from Donations for Three Years</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Correspondent] The county tax collection office of this county has been ordered by the provincial government that in order to invest social floating capital in building houses and solve the housing shortage among the people, all cities and counties in the province will be allowed to exempt newly built houses from land tax for one year and house donation for three years from September 1, 1945.

<h3>Grain Hoarding Found in Mudu: Rice Shops Submit a Statement to Defend Themselves</h3>
<p>The truth is still under secret investigation</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 9th] Regarding the case of rice merchants hoarding grain in Mudu, the rice shops jointly submitted a statement to the county government, claiming that they were stored food rations and that the actual rice reserves were less than 20,000 shi. The county government is now secretly investigating the truth based on the accounts being reviewed. County Magistrate Shen stated that if there is evidence of hoarding, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Yu Jingde, Communist Cadre in Shazhou, Defects</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Police Administration in Various Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the counties south of the Yangtze River in this province have long been stable, and the entire northern Jiangsu has now been recovered. The police offices originally established in various counties have been reorganized into police stations, and the water police corps have been reorganized into water police stations. In order to understand the actual work of the municipal police agencies throughout the province in order to improve it, police supervisor Cha Jiyu has been specially dispatched to various counties to strictly supervise and assess them.</p>
<h3>Six Central Tasks for Taixian County's Construction This Year</h3>

<p>Suzhou Lifts Dance Ban for 20 Days: Raises 30 Million Yuan in Funds</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Tiger Hill, a famous scenic area in this city, has been in disrepair for many years. With the bright spring weather and increasing numbers of tourists, it is inevitable that it will lose its appearance. Military and government leaders here have paid attention to this and have recently organized a committee to organize and renovate the Tiger Hill scenic area and launch a campaign to raise funds. The method is to lift the ban on dancing for 20 days to raise 20 million yuan. As of the 10th of this month, the full amount has been raised and work will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Five-Nation Peace Treaty Signed Today: Italy Plans to Request the Right to Retain Amendments: Ambassador Qian Tai Represents Our Country in Signing the Treaty with Italy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] According to government sources: The Peace Treaty with Austria will be signed in Paris on the 10th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Qian Tai stationed in France to sign on behalf of the country. Furthermore, according to diplomatic sources, although the Italian government has decided to sign the treaty, it has declared to the four foreign ministers that it reserves the right to request amendments in the future in the form of bilateral treaties because its requests were not accepted by the four foreign ministers. The Italian ambassador to China recently presented the aforementioned statement to the four foreign ministers to our Foreign Minister Wang on the orders of the Italian government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] It is reported that the signing ceremony for the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland will be held tomorrow at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The writing desks used by King Louis XV and Louis XVI of France will be borrowed from the National Museum for the signing. According to reports, this writing desk was used by the revolutionary government of the time, the Committee of Public Safety, during the French Revolution from 1793 to 1795.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] As the signing ceremony of the peace treaties with the five former enemy countries is scheduled for tomorrow, it seems that some issues of general concern have not yet received definite answers. The entire Paris is asking: "Will Yugoslavia join other countries in signing the peace treaties?" When South Foreign Minister Simic departed from Belgrade, the Yugoslav government's communique stated that Simic's mission was to sign the peace treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, without mentioning the peace treaty with Italy. When Simic arrived in Paris yesterday, he declined to comment on this matter. Another matter of concern is the four-power resolution announced yesterday, which does not allow former enemy countries to make oral or written statements at the signing ceremony. It is generally known that the five former enemy countries are all prepared to make statements at that time. These five countries have not yet expressed their views on the four-power resolution, but it is expected that they will protest if they are not allowed to express their opinions at the signing. Delegations from Finland, Romania, and Bulgaria arrived in Paris last night. Representatives from Italy and Hungary have not yet arrived and may all be able to arrive tonight. The atmosphere in Paris is like the scene when the 21-nation peace conference was held last summer.</p>
<h3>Procedure for Drafting the Peace Treaty with Germany: U.S. Representative Proposes Plan: Belarus Demands Huge Reparations from Germany: The Four Powers Agree to End the Principle of Occupation of Austria</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] Regarding the procedure for drafting the peace treaty with Germany, the U.S. delegation recently submitted a plan to the Council of Foreign Ministers, stipulating that the four foreign ministers should hold a meeting one month before the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to draft the peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the instructions separately given by the four foreign ministers. All countries that have participated in the war against Germany with significant military forces should send representatives to attend the meeting. At that time, the four foreign ministers' meetings will establish four committees responsible for handling the following four issues, namely (1) the German political system and its constitution; (2) territorial issues; (3) economic issues and reparations; and (4) disarmament and demilitarization. Each committee will be organized by one representative from each of the four powers. Each member may elect a United Nations representative to join the committee, and experts must be appointed with the unanimous consent of the four committees. The Allied Nations of the United Nations may clearly state their opinions during discussions and may obtain copies of all documents submitted to the foreign ministers for public discussion. The peace treaty with Germany drafted by the four foreign ministers' meetings should first be submitted to the governments of the participating countries and then to the four foreign ministers' conferences.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Belarusian representative presented his views to the Council of Foreign Ministers today, requesting reparations worth US$1.5 billion from Germany. The Ruhr area should be handed over to the Soviet Union for joint control.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th Special Dispatch] The Council of Foreign Ministers agreed in principle today to end the occupation of Austria when the peace treaty with Austria comes into effect, and to withdraw the occupying Allied forces within 90 days after the treaty comes into effect. Regarding the issue of repatriation of Austrian prisoners of war, it was decided to hand it over to the Military Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Greek Political Prisoners: Issue of Execution</h3>
<p>The Security Council will meet today to discuss</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 9th] A special meeting of the Security Council will be convened tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of Greek guerrillas sentenced to death. The United Nations investigation team has asked the Security Council whether it can intervene on behalf of six guerrillas sentenced to death in northern Greece. Although the Greek government has ordered a temporary reprieve of the execution, it has also instructed its representative in New York to oppose the investigation team's intervention. However, a telegram from Friday stated that three guerrillas had already been executed because the order to postpone the execution arrived too late. Reliable sources in New York said that the Greek government's order to postpone the execution expired at midnight on Friday, so all the prisoners had been executed. The UK's opinion is that the scope of the investigation team's activities is not limited to Greece alone, but also includes Bulgaria, South, and Albania, so if it wants to intervene, it must include all four countries, and not just Greece. It is generally expected that if the Security Council decides to intervene, it may lead to a crisis in the Greek government.</p>
<h3>Greece Takes Precautions: Prevents Leftist Activities</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 8th] The Greek Army Garrison Command and local police stations today ordered all their military and police forces to be on alert, preparing to respond to the illegal demonstrations that the Greek Left-wing Front is rumored to be holding on Sunday. Police and army authorities said that the planned anti-government mass rally would not be held here or in Patras or Thessaloniki.</p>
<h3>U.S. Emphasis: Trade Policy</h3>
<p>Congressional and Governmental Opinions Diverge</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 8th] Republican leaders in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives stated today that they may part ways on a significant foreign policy issue: the State Department's authority to reduce tariffs without consulting Congress. While key Republican senators seek a compromise to prevent the immediate repeal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, key Republican representatives are demanding a complete review of the plan. The chairman of the House Budget Committee announced that the committee will hold a closed-door meeting on the 24th of this month to begin hearing opinions from various parties, signaling disapproval of the</p>
<p>Compromise</p>
<p>It is reported that the compromise has the support of senior State Department officials, stipulating the inclusion of supplementary clauses in agreements with other countries, and granting the President the authority to adjudicate tariffs, thereby protecting the U.S. economy. Accordingly, the ultimate power remains with the President, not Congress, which is opposed by some representatives. The Reciprocal Trade Program aims to establish world trade by allowing the State Department to reduce tariffs by up to 50 percent in return for similar concessions from other countries. According to sources close to Republican Senator Vandenberg, Vandenberg believes that the Republican decision on whether to maintain the</p>
<p>Reciprocal Trade</p>
<p>program seems to partially determine whether a unified foreign policy between the two parties will continue. Vandenberg is a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1948, and he clearly wants to prevent the Republican Party from being labeled "isolationist" by the Democratic Party in the upcoming election campaign. Some senators from Western states share this view. Therefore, if the House of Representatives strongly pushes for a thorough reform plan, the Senate may block its passage. This is one of the main reasons why Vandenberg did not want to accompany Secretary of State Marshall to the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Will Not Run: Next Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 8th] Republican Senator Vandenberg delivered a speech here today, urging labor and management to cease their disputes. He stated: "The current situation in the United States, where labor and management are engaged in unrestricted mutual strangulation, is simply suicidal. The government should adopt new labor laws, especially to replace strike bans. Because strikes damage public property, it is tantamount to civil disorder." At the same time, Vandenberg told the press: "I will not run for the next presidential candidate."</p>
<h3>13,000 Arrested: Supporters of the Punjab Muslim League</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 8th] Seventy-four of the seventy-nine Muslim League members in the Punjab Provincial Assembly have been arrested due to disturbances by Muslim League members in the province, in violation of the Punjab Public Safety Act. These disturbances have been going on for fourteen days. According to estimates by Muslim League members, 13,000 Muslim League supporters have been arrested.</p>
<h3>Military Uses of Infrared Rays: Wartime Secret Now Revealed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Research on infrared rays was a top secret during the war. Now that the ban has been lifted, it is known that infrared rays were also used in combat. For example, infrared rays were used for signaling, which others could not see but could be received by those with special equipment. The sinking of the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" and another Japanese battleship by small submarines in the giant floating dock of Bergen, Norway, in September 1944, the cutting of underwater telegraph cables in the Pacific, and the North African landings all used infrared rays. In addition, the secret activities of underground movements, the escape of Allied prisoners, and the Battle of the Bulge at night all relied on infrared guidance. Night combat by the Royal Air Force also used infrared rays for signaling. During the two World Wars, infrared rays were the most magical means of communication for the sea, land, and air. Automatic weapons equipped with automatic infrared sights have also been invented, but because the war ended too early, they were not formally used on the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Control Plan: U.S. Unwilling to Compromise Vandenberg Makes It Clear to Soviet Union That Eloquence Is of No Practical Use Disarmament Issue at a Standstill</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 8th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg stated here: "We will never unilaterally disarm, as most of the world is still separated by the Iron Curtain. The situation behind the Iron Curtain is difficult to believe without seeing it firsthand. But if there are sanctions against violating disarmament agreements, we are willing to disarm simultaneously with other countries. To show international goodwill, the United States is prepared to give up the benefits of the atomic bomb, but this abandonment must be protected by a perfect inspection and control system, and all countries in the world, especially the Soviet Union, must quickly agree to punish those who violate the agreement. This is the price we demand, and this price must be paid. We will never trust any fickle words, because the agreements of Yalta and Potsdam, as well as the recent promises to Poland, have been broken too many times."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] The representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Security Council subcommittee have completely conflicting views on the scope of authority of the future Disarmament Committee. United Nations personnel here are quite discouraged and pessimistic. The United States hopes that the organizational law of the Disarmament Committee will stipulate that it should not involve matters within the scope of the Atomic Energy Committee, while the Soviet Union opposes making such a provision in the draft. Therefore, when the Security Council meets on the 11th of this month, there will be a tense atmosphere, and it is expected that the veto power will not be used in the meeting, but the Soviet Union's opposition alone is enough to make the organization of any Disarmament Committee exist in name only. Therefore, before the Security Council votes on this case, both sides will do their best to reach an agreement. In general, the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union arises from suspicion, because the U.S. delegation firmly believes that the Soviet Union hopes that the Disarmament Committee will eventually include the scope and function of the Atomic Energy Committee.</p>
<h3>Palestine Problem: New British Plan Details</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Five-Year Trusteeship</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The Arab delegation attending the Palestine Conference announced this morning after a meeting at the Egyptian Embassy that they are drafting a reply, which will be submitted to the British delegation on Monday, in response to the British government's recent new plan for Palestine. At the same time, according to Ghori, secretary of the Palestinian Arab Party, the Arabs are clearly dissatisfied with the new British proposal. The Jewish Agency is scheduled to discuss the new British plan tonight. It is reported that the latter's content is to establish a five-year trusteeship and convene a constitutional assembly to decide on a permanent constitution. During the trusteeship period, a Jewish and Arab advisory committee will be established to assist the British central government.</p>
<h3>General Election in Japan: Mid-May Two New Parties to Merge</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese Cabinet decided on the 8th to expedite the completion of the parliamentary tasks before the end of March, and to secure the passage of the constitutional subsidiary bills during this period. As for when to dissolve the parliament, it has not been decided because it is related to the election of senators and local elections. Interior Minister Uehara stated today that the date of the general election will be roughly in mid-May.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] According to reports: The Cooperative Democratic Party and the People's Party will merge to prepare for participation in the next general election. This is in response to MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, instructing him to hold a general election as soon as possible after the current parliamentary session is adjourned. Both parties are new parties with few members. The merger of the two parties will increase the chances of being elected during the election. The merger of the two parties can occupy 78 seats in the parliament, so after the merger, it can become a major party in the current cabinet.</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions within the Socialist Party</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] Socialist Party members held a meeting today to discuss the issue of forming a coalition cabinet. Unjuro Muto, Mikiji Mori, and others advocated abandoning coalition work. Katsuji Sugimoto, Kanemitsu Yoshikawa, and others supported coalition work. Secretary-General Nishio stated that if a general election is held immediately, coalition work should be abandoned. However, the current parliamentary session has many bills, and the session will inevitably be extended to around April 20, and the general election can only be held around May 20. The establishment of a new cabinet will be between the end of May and the beginning of June. During this period, whether politics can be entrusted to conservative power is worthy of consideration.</p>

<h3>Severe Coal Shortage in Britain: Government Faces Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 8th] British industry is on the verge of a large-scale shutdown today. At the same time, a Labor Party spokesman warned that the coal shortage crisis threatens the end of the Labor government, and the rise of socialism is at hand. It is reported that the situation in major industrial areas such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham is chaotic, and four million workers will be unemployed starting at midnight on Sunday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The Conservative Party will hold a meeting this weekend to discuss the coal shortage crisis. The result may be a motion of no confidence in the government in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 8th] Fuel Minister Shinwell announced in the House of Commons yesterday that half of England was without power due to the lack of coal, and he has now become the target of criticism in British newspapers (including Labor Party newspapers). Three Conservative Party local newspapers said, "Shinwell should get out!" The Labor Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," said, "Frankly, we think some cabinet members are just deceiving themselves." Shinwell declined to comment on how long the power outage would last, but the press firmly believes that it will be at least two weeks. A minority of Liberal Party members demanded Shinwell's resignation at a meeting in London, but Shinwell told reporters that he had no intention of resigning.</p>
<h3>Heavy Snow in London</h3>

Finally, a draft amnesty decree was passed, but collaborators were excluded.</p>
<h3>Eliminate the Red Threat in the U.S.: Republicans Determined to Go All Out House Speaker Martin Says</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 8th] House Speaker Martin told reporters today that the Republican Party will eliminate the red threat in the United States. He said: "The Republican Party will work with the House Un-American Activities Committee to deal with what Committee Chairman Thomas calls the Communist conspiracy. The purpose of the Committee is to eliminate the red threat from the United States and drive it out of the government, because a small number of powerful people occupying strategic positions have launched a campaign to destroy the American system and replace it with communism." Martin added: "They are enemies within the household, occupying prominent positions, trying to shake policies and influence public opinion." According to Thomas, last Thursday's confrontation between the Committee and U.S. Communist Party leader Eisler was just the beginning of a campaign to expose the Communist conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government.</p>

<h3>A Serious Report by the U.S. Government: An Analysis of Soviet Strength (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Abridged Translation by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>The U.S. Library of Congress recently compiled and printed a book studying the current situation in the Soviet Union at the request of Illinois Representative McKinnon. The book is titled "The Practice of Communism" and is published by the Government Printing Office. The book is based on official archives and carefully analyzed, and it is broad in scope, fair in argument, and very valuable. The following is an abridged translation of the chapter on Soviet military equipment.</p>
<p>Five Five-Year Plans to Catch Up with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>In the twenty-five years from 1946 to 1970, the Soviet Union has set up five five-year plans, preparing to implement them in stages. The Soviet Union's national defense equipment is also largely based on these five-year plans. It can be seen from Stalin's recent speeches that he wants to increase the Soviet Union's military strength to be equal to the current military strength of the United States. Stalin once said that, according to his prediction, future conflicts are unavoidable. He has set several goals for scientific research and agricultural and industrial production (actually military production) so that the Soviet Union can cope with all possible accidents and consequences.</p>
<p>In the five-year plan from 1946 to 1950, one of the main tasks was to continue to improve the Soviet Union's national defense capabilities and supply its army with modern equipment.</p>
<p>This five-year plan places great emphasis on scientific research, especially science related to national defense plans. Atomic research is the top priority. They are using great efforts to urge experts across the country to work hard to catch up with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In the five five-year plans from 1946 to 1970, those related to national defense are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increase steel production to 60 million tons per year (the United States produced 80 million tons in 1945);</p>
<p>(2) Increase pig iron production to 50 million tons per year (almost equal to the United States' production in 1945);</p>
<p>(3) Produce 500 million tons of coal per year (the United States produced 575 million tons of bituminous coal in 1945);</p>
<p>(4) Produce 420 million barrels of oil per year (the United States produced 1.7 billion barrels of oil in 1945). When studying the above figures, we must remember that the United States' production in 1945 reached such a large number because the war situation was urgent and it tried its best to expand the scope of factories. Now that the war has ended, the United States' production may gradually decline in recent years. At the same time, the Soviet Union is planning to expand the factories established during the war.</p>
<p>The United States has begun to realize that several of its richest resources are about to be depleted. At the same time, the Soviet Union claims that more than half of the world's many minerals and raw materials that are important to industrial development and national defense are located in the Soviet Union. In particular, according to the Soviet Union, more than half of the world's known oil and iron ore are in the hands of the Soviet Union. Agriculture is extremely important to national defense, and only the United States can compare with the Soviet Union in the world.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union government has already planned an industrial dispersal procedure, so that if an enemy country invades in the future, it will never again wipe out its industrial center in one fell swoop. The evacuation procedure was accelerated during the war and is still continuing.</p>
<p>Military Strength May Reach Total of Five Countries in 25 Years</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's current military strength is not comparable to that of the United States. Although it still maintains a strong army, it lost millions of young people in World War II, and the new recruits who were later added have not been trained, and many people have not reached the age of military service. Although the Soviet Union can produce a large number of tanks and artillery, it cannot manufacture long-range aircraft that can compete with others. The Soviet Union's electronics industry is also underdeveloped. The Soviet Union's navy has been greatly strengthened in recent years, but it is still very weak compared to the British and American navies. However, in any case, the Soviet Union's potential military strength is worthy of our close attention.</p>
<p>If Stalin's speech on February 9, 1946, is implemented, then, according to official predictions, the original population of the Soviet Union (that is, the population within the original territory of the Soviet Union before World War II) will increase to 250 million within 20 years. If the Baltic countries incorporated into the Soviet Union after the war are included, the population of the Soviet Union can increase by several million, perhaps more, by 1970. At that time, there may be 32 million men between the ages of 20 and 34 in the original population of the Soviet Union alone, of which 22 million are between the ages of 20 and 29, belonging to the most ideal military service force.</p>
<p>During the same period, the population of the United States will reach 160 million, of which 18 million are men between the ages of 20 and 34, and about 10.5 million are between the ages of 20 and 29.</p>
<p>The 32 million men in the Soviet Union in 1970 are almost equal to the sum of the military-age manpower of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.</p>

<h3>Assembly to Promote Domestic Products Turns Into Brawl One of Twelve Injured Dies 17 Arrested and Released on Bail After Police Station Interrogation to be Transferred to Court this Morning on Disorderly Conduct Charges</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, someone, in the name of the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," convened a preparatory meeting. Most of the participants, after arriving at the meeting, discovered that the gathering had political motives and was not a movement to promote domestic goods, so they rose up in opposition, leading to a brawl in which as many as twelve people were injured. Among them, Liang Renda (clerk in the Western shoe department of Wing On Company, Cantonese, 30 years old) died of serious injuries. The circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Distributing Leaflets and Singing Anti-American Songs</p>
<p>At nine o'clock yesterday morning, someone, in the name of the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," convened workers from various labor unions to hold a preparatory meeting. The meeting address stated in the notice was the Xindu Restaurant. After receiving the notice, the various labor unions, unaware of the truth, mostly sent representatives to participate. There was no one at Xindu, and it was rumored that it had been changed to the upstairs of the Daxin Company, but the result was the same. Finally, they learned that it was being held on the third floor of the China Industrial Bank Building at 334 Nanjing Road. There were more than a hundred participants in succession. The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo and Deng Chumin, and "A Letter to People from All Walks of Life on Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," as well as songs such as "American Goods Are Evil Spirits," "Rascals Who Create Internal Strife," "Can't Drive Away the American Troops, We Are Not Satisfied," and "American Troops, Get Out Quickly" were distributed on the spot. A portion of the participants rose up and sang in unison. At the same time, Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, and others continued to arrive, but left shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Sudden Brawl, Great Disorder</p>
<p>Most of the participants had originally come to promote domestic goods, but after arriving at the meeting, they realized that it was not a movement to promote domestic goods, but an anti-American movement with political motives, so they rose up in opposition. For a time, there was great disorder, leading to a brawl. During the brawl, some people shouted slogans such as "Down with the National Government." After the Huangpu Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau received a report, it immediately dispatched police to suppress and maintain order. Eighteen members of the crowd involved in the brawl (one of whom, Liang Renda, was seriously injured and transferred to Renji Hospital for treatment) were taken to the Huangpu Branch. Eleven of them were slightly injured. After arriving at the bureau, they were accompanied by police officers from the branch to Renji Hospital for bandaging and then returned to the bureau. After being questioned by the Second Section, they were released on bail separately at dusk yesterday. The case will be transferred to the court for handling this morning on charges of disrupting public order.</p>
<p>List of Seventeen People</p>
<p>The list of the seventeen people taken to the bureau and released that evening is as follows: (1) Cao Zhenkun (China Textile First Factory), (2) Shen Xiafeng (China Tobacco Company), (3) Wang Yuxiang (worker), (4) Wang Fugen (China Textile Sixteenth Factory), (5) Cai Futian (worker), (6) Meng Zhisheng (worker), (7) Chen Xunquan (resident of the Guo Huo Company dormitory), (8) Li Baxiong (clerk at the Sun Sun Company), (9) Sun Shoukang (clerk at the Sincere Company), (10) Yang Jun (worker, resident of the Sun Sun Company dormitory), (11) Shen Shikui (resident of the Guo Huo Company dormitory), (12) Du Xuesan (Guanshengyuan), (13) Xu Weicheng (Sun Sun Company outlet), (14) Liu Zongde (Kang Le Restaurant), (15) Li Ruichun (Wing On Company), (16) Zeng Yongquan (Wing On Company), (17) Song Yong (Wing On Company).</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Yu Visits the Injured</h3>
<p>Furthermore, Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, specially accompanied Zhang Renyou, Director of the Huangpu Branch, to Renji Hospital at three o'clock yesterday afternoon to visit Liang Renda, who was seriously injured. At that time, Liang was already in a coma. After the doctor diagnosed him with "fractured base of the skull, concussion and bleeding," Yu instructed the doctor to treat him carefully and comforted Liang's family. Later, Deputy Director Yu personally inquired about the five people brought to the bureau at the Huangpu Branch. Liang Renda died of his injuries at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Deceased Liang Renda: Parents Deceased, Recently Married</h3>
<p>Last night, the reporter visited the residence of Liang Renda, who was brutally killed in a brawl, at No. 6, Yongle New Village, Zhejiang North Road. At that time, Liang's aunt, Liang Qu, had just returned home from the Huangpu Branch in tears. According to her, "The deceased was thirty years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He studied at Pui Ching English School in Hong Kong. After coming to Shanghai, he served in the shoe department of Wing On Company for more than ten years. At eight o'clock this morning, he went to the company from home. At about ten o'clock, I heard that there was a fight, so I accompanied his wife to the company to look for him, but we couldn't find him. So we returned home. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock, the hospital sent a car to inform us that he was injured. He died at half-past four. Afterwards, I heard that after he went to the company, someone told him that there was a meeting at the Quangong Building, so he went with them. Unexpectedly, he was beaten and injured in the stairwell." She continued, "Liang got married last May. His wife, Gao Shaoshan, also works in the ticket department of Wing On's third factory. She is currently five months pregnant. He usually has no savings, and his future life will be a problem." She also said, "The deceased's parents died when he was young. He was raised by his uncle and me. It is very unjust that he has suffered this misfortune. Currently, only two colleagues from Wing On Company are helping to take care of the aftermath. I have gone to the Huangpu Branch to ask for justice. I was instructed to go with my niece-in-law again at nine o'clock tomorrow morning."</p>
<h3>Yu Shuping's Statement: Those Involved in the Brawl Have Been Released on Bail Will Spare No Expense to Treat the Injured</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Deputy Director Yu Shuping made a statement to reporters at four o'clock yesterday afternoon, expressing two points regarding the Nanjing Road brawl yesterday morning: (1) The bureau did not receive a notice of this morning's worker gathering in advance. The Police Bureau is an organization responsible for the security of the entire Shanghai area. Anyone who disrupts social order and tranquility has the right to be stopped and arrested. Therefore, after the brawl occurred, the police bureau rushed to the scene upon receiving the alarm and immediately carried out their duties. Regardless of the inside story of the brawl, anyone who was found to be fighting was arrested. Now, upon receiving instructions from the mayor, all those arrested have been granted bail. The bail procedures are currently being processed, and they can all be released on bail before tonight (that is, yesterday). This case will be transferred to the local court for handling in accordance with the law. (2) Director Zhang of the Huangpu Branch and I specially went to Renji Hospital at three o'clock this afternoon to visit Liang Renda, who was the most seriously injured in this brawl and is being treated at Renji Hospital. Mr. Liang was injured in the head and is currently in a coma. I have instructed the attending physician to spare no expense on medical supplies and do their best to treat him.</p>
<h3>If Foreknowledge Existed, Incident Believed Avoidable: Huangpu Branch Chief Responds on Two Points</h3>
<p>Following the clashes yesterday morning stemming from a "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods" meeting, at around 6:00 PM, while the Huangpu Branch was processing bail for those involved in the mutual assault, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Ma Yinchu, Hu Ziying, and others, representing the "China Academic Workers Association," visited the branch to express their condolences to the injured. Guo and others posed two questions to Branch Chief Zhang: (1) Why did this morning's incident degenerate so badly? (2) How will the police handle this case? Branch Chief Zhang responded: "(1) The police were unaware of this morning's meeting beforehand. It was only after the fighting broke out that the bureau learned that the clash was due to the meeting. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched officers to maintain order and brought those involved in the mutual assault to the station to be dealt with according to the law. Had the police been aware of this morning's gathering in advance, we believe this unfortunate incident would not have occurred. (2) Mutual assault constitutes a disturbance of public order and a threat to peace. This case will be transferred to the court for handling. All those arrested for assault, except for Liang Renda who was sent to the hospital for treatment, will be released on bail before tonight."</p>
<h3>Suggestion for Private Management of Central District Fire Brigade: Chen Tingrui Provides Concrete Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Councilor Chen Tingrui, regarding the major fire on Seymour Road and Wuding Road, previously suggested to the Municipal Council that the Central District Fire Brigade be converted to private management. The council then submitted the matter to the Police Affairs Committee for resolution, requesting Mr. Chen to provide a concrete plan for submission to the plenary session for discussion. It is now learned that the council has received Mr. Chen's reply to the chairman and vice-chairman, first outlining the drawbacks of the city's central district fire service: (1) Authority cannot be unified. The superiors' time and energy are largely spent on bureaucratic formalities, so that even after lengthy official correspondence, concrete results are often not achieved. (2) The fire department lacks specialized personnel. New aerial ladder trucks and chemical fire extinguishers cannot be used effectively due to the lack of trained operators. (3) Firefighters' salaries are meager, insufficient for basic needs, resulting in a situation where superiors lose dignity and subordinates disregard discipline. Firefighters are certainly responsible to the citizens when they fail to perform their duties, but is the government not also responsible to the firefighters and the citizens when it fails to do its job? It is unfair to place all the responsibility on the firefighters. (4) Funding is severely inadequate. (5) Firefighting technology is declining.</p>
<p>Next, he argued that the only way to improve the Shanghai fire service is through private management, outlining the advantages as follows: (1) Unified authority. No need to worry about interference. (2) Besides higher-level staff and specialized personnel, the fire department can use a volunteer system, which can greatly reduce expenses. (3) Volunteer firefighters have a sense of service and dedication. (4) All matters managed privately will avoid bureaucratization. The addition of equipment and the purchase of spare parts can all be done openly, eliminating opportunities for corruption.</p>
<h3>US Military Tribunal Concludes; Director Yangge Remains in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The US Military Tribunal in China, since the execution of its work in trying Japanese and German war criminals, from the autumn of 1945 to the spring of this year, has been working for two years, having tried successively the Hankou murder case, the case of the victims of the Doolittle pilots, and the German Nazi espionage case, and other cases large and small, for a total of twenty cases. Since the conclusion of the Ohlhaver case, the work of the US Military Tribunal has also come to an end, and the personnel of the US War Crimes Investigation Committee have also returned to their countries one after another, but Colonel Yangge, the director of the committee, is still in Shanghai, because the US military still has a few cases that have not been concluded, and the work of repatriating German war criminals must also be handled, so he will stay for a while.</p>
<h3>Urging Repayment of Old Debts: Former Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Form Compensation Committee, Demand Calculation Based on Cost of Living Index, Large Sum Poses Financial Burden for Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Former employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have been demanding repayment of their retirement funds, savings funds, and pension funds since the victory, but have not yet received a resolution. After Mayor Wu took office last year, he organized the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official. The Claims and Debts Liquidation Committee established a team specifically to discuss this matter, but due to various difficulties, it could not be resolved immediately. The French Municipal Council portion is still under investigation for matters such as account books and personnel lists. The Municipal Council portion is said to have drafted a plan, but despite repeated inquiries by reporters, officials have kept its contents secret. According to a municipal government official who spoke to our reporter, if calculated according to the current cost of living index, the amount would be roughly equivalent to the entire municipal government budget for this year, which is clearly beyond the financial capacity of the local government.</p>
<p>According to the Treaty on the Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China, signed by the British, American, and Chinese governments on January 11, 1943, it stipulates that the Chinese government inherits all the claims and debts of the former Municipal Council and is responsible for handling them. Therefore, former Municipal Council employees believe that the Chinese government should respect the treaty, fulfill this obligation, and repay their retirement, pension, and savings funds. Since the treaty was signed by the central government, the repayment should also be the responsibility of the central government, not a matter for the local government. If the amount is said to be too large, the government has profited greatly from the sale of enemy and puppet assets, far exceeding this amount, and a portion of it could be allocated for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Insist on Full Payment Before the End of March</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Association, including the general office, finance office, tax office, engineering office, health office, education office, fire department, Chinese office, and legal office, a total of 5,700 Chinese employees (excluding the police department), specifically organized a compensation committee, which hosted reporters yesterday afternoon to publish a statement to people from all walks of life, demanding that the government authorities make full payment before the end of March this year, and resolutely demanded that it be calculated according to the cost of living index at the time of payment, because this amount is based on the base salary deducted in the Republic of China 25th year. The authorities once intended to issue it based on the December index of more than 5,000 times, but even now, the index has risen to more than 8,000 times. Prolonging it in this way is only detrimental to the government. It is estimated that the average savings per person are about 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the calculation of dates, they firmly believe that Chinese employees should be treated completely equally with British and American employees.</p>
<h3>If Aircraft Accidents Reoccur, Prosecutions for Negligent Homicide Will Be Pursued; Pilots from Two Airlines Despondent, Submit Resignations</h3>
<p>Passenger transport on the China and Central Airlines has been ordered to resume by the Ministry of Communications last Friday. However, the two companies' passenger aircraft have not yet resumed flights as of last week. It is understood that because preparatory work is not yet ready, resumption of flights will be delayed for two or three days. However, postal and cargo transportation are still operating as usual for both companies. According to other sources, the heads of flight operations for both companies have been informed by the district attorney's office that if passenger aircraft accidents reoccur, the district attorney's office will file public charges of negligent homicide against the heads of flight operations. As such, the heads of flight operations for both companies believe that passenger aircraft accidents cannot be predicted by human effort, and that the flight operations departments cannot guarantee absolute safety for future passenger transport, and have submitted their resignations to the company authorities. In addition to retaining flight operations personnel to continue working with peace of mind, the company is submitting a request to the Ministry of Communications for instructions on how to handle the situation.</p>

<h3>Elimination of a Menace on the Beijing-Shanghai Night Train: Notorious Thief Liu Hangxia and Accomplices to Appear in Court Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the capture of Liu Hangxia, the leader of the "Four Famous Mountains" gang of thieves, the Railway Bureau Police Department yesterday released a detailed account of the case's resolution. According to Liu's confession: They impersonated air force personnel and specialized in stealing from passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai night train, only targeting large sums of money. They committed numerous crimes over the past two months, and the exact number could no longer be remembered. When asked by the Railway Bureau Police Department where the stolen money went, they replied that it was spent on hotels and dance halls. When asked which dance hostesses they were friendly with at the dance halls, they replied that Lu Ping and Da Luo (another accomplice of Liu's) were relatively close, like mistresses. She works the late shift at the Da Hu Dance Hall. Liu Jinshan (another accomplice) had a relatively affectionate and close relationship with Zhang Meihua, a hostess at the MGM Dance Hall. However, according to a letter from Lu Ping yesterday, she stated: "Having read the news in your newspaper on February 9 about the arrest of notorious thief Liu Hangxia, which included a photo of myself, I have investigated and found that I have never had any dealings with this Mr. Liu, and I certainly did not give him my photo. I previously had a photo that I was planning to give to a Filipino musician colleague, but it was discovered missing from my purse. The back of the photo has a note indicating it was intended as a gift to a foreign colleague, which can serve as proof, and I am from Zhejiang Province, so the report of overseas Chinese Lu Ping is also untrue." Liu, Zhang, and the other three criminals are scheduled to be brought to the District Attorney's Office today.</p>
<h3>Military Criminals Meeting Amnesty Requirements: Twenty-Nine More Released</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Prison continued to release 29 military criminals who met the requirements for amnesty. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent military judges to the prison to verify their identities and release them after confirmation. This is the first time military criminals have been released in this city since the amnesty order was issued. A total of 111 criminals have been released.</p>
<h3>Fight over Razor Leads to Violence; Scissors Puncture Abdomen</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Yongbin (30 years old, from Yangzhou), a worker at the No. 1 Barber Shop on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district, got into an argument with barber Cao Kaili (20 years old) yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM over who would use the razor. The argument escalated into a violent brawl. In a fit of anger, Zhou grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed Cao in the abdomen, causing a serious injury with intestines protruding and profuse bleeding, leaving him unconscious on the spot. Police officers took the injured man to the hospital and detained the assailant at the Songshan Branch for questioning.</p>

<h3>Various Trade Unions Issue Declaration, Detail Deceptive Participation, Request Government Thoroughly Investigate the Organizing Body</h3>
<p>The various trade unions of Shanghai City, regarding the incident yesterday (the ninth) in which many workers were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Boycott American Goods" meeting and were assaulted, issued a declaration as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear Compatriots: Yesterday, we, the various trade unions, received a notice from the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American-Made Goods," asking us to attend a meeting at the Xindu Theater at the intersection of Wenben Road and Tianjin Road at 9:00 AM today to discuss the promotion of domestic goods. The notice stated at the outset that the purpose of the gathering was "to promote domestic goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis." We workers feel the pain of industrial and commercial depression the most, and work hard every day to increase production and support this difficult situation. "Promoting domestic goods" has long been a demand in our hearts. Therefore, we, with a sense of enthusiasm, yesterday evening rushed to the Xindu Theater this morning. After arriving, two friends wearing red flowers on their lapels changed the location, saying that the meeting would be held at the Workers' Building, so I rushed to the Workers' Building again, but when we arrived, the meeting seemed to be already in progress. Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Deng Chumin were on the stage, and some people in the audience were singing the four songs "American Troops Get Out Quickly," "Can't Drive Away the Americans," "Bastards Creating Civil War," and "American Goods Are Harmful" The lyrics did not mention the promotion of domestic goods at all, except to stir up anti-American sentiments. We began to feel uneasy, and thought to ourselves, it must be some party using the slogan of "promoting domestic goods" to launch its "anti-American behavior." While hesitating, suddenly the shouts of "Down with the Nationalist Government" and "Support the Communist Party" were raised, and at this point, the true colors were completely exposed. We, this group of workers, were just like many other people in the hall, and a feeling of indignation after being deceived suddenly surged in our hearts. We questioned those friends wearing red flowers and holding leather bags, why were they not "promoting domestic goods" but focusing on "driving out American troops" and "overthrowing the Nationalist Government." Unexpectedly, these words offended those friends wearing red flowers, and without allowing any explanation, they opened their mouths and cursed "saboteurs," shouted "fight," and tables, chairs, and benches all flew over, and the innocent masses were knocked down. After the incident, it was learned that seven people were injured, one of whom had died from serious injuries. I never thought that people who sing the praises of "democracy" and "freedom" would use such shameless means to fool good workers and make them sacrifices for their political infighting. It's really chilling!</p>
<p>The people's eyes are bright, and this kind of trick can only deceive for a while, and cannot deceive us. Although workers have low knowledge, we are confident that we can judge right from wrong, and we will never be used by a few people with ulterior motives. This deception makes people feel as insulted as being raped. We will not play with moving terms, nor will we use flowery language. We will just honestly present the facts to the public and ask for justice and sympathy from fair-minded people.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to express our attitude with a solemn mood. (1) We will firmly support the movement to promote domestic goods, and we ask the Municipal Council of this city to lead all sectors of society and immediately organize a movement organization that truly represents the public opinion to promote domestic goods and study the active promotion. (2) We will resolutely oppose stealing the slogan of "promoting domestic goods" to engage in political conspiracy. (3) We believe that the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods" should be fully responsible for this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Miraculous and Profound: Youth at Hongqiao School for the Blind Regains Sight After Fifteen Years of Blindness Thanks to Skillful Healing of Austrian Eye Specialist Professor Fuchs, Saving Him from Darkness and Despair</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Even if this is not a miracle, it is at least a rare occurrence in the world. A young man who has been blind for fifteen years, after undergoing miraculous surgery by Austrian eye specialist Professor Fuchs, can now see the light again. This will not only make the beneficiary happy, but I believe everyone who hears this news will feel how magical and profound the things in this world are, and Professor Fuchs' skillful healing technique cannot but be admired and amazed.</p>
<p>Blind Since Three Years Old</p>
<p>This lucky man's name is Wang Dawei, and he is 20 years old this year, from Zhangzhou, Fujian. According to what he told reporters, he went blind in both eyes when he was three years old. Later, he was taken to Singapore by a foreigner for treatment, but it was ineffective, so he was sent to the Shanghai School for the Blind when he was seven years old. When he first came, he could still see some sunlight, but later it became deeper and deeper, until he lost all light. After spending thirteen years at the School for the Blind, although he was able to get comfort materially for these past ten years, everything in front of him was darkness and despair. Like a gift from heaven, Professor Fuchs came to China from Vienna four months ago to lecture, and took up the exclusive task of treating students in the School for the Blind. Professor Fuchs began to examine the eyes of more than 80 students, and found that there were two who could still be restored to sight, one of the two was Wang Dawei.</p>
<p>Eye Bulge Hole Allows Him to See Objects</p>
<p>Professor Fuchs studied Wang Dawei's eyes and found that his right eye had hope, but the surgery was very complicated. If he used the ordinary method of transplanting someone else's eye, it would not work, so he made a hole in his eyeball. The result of the surgery was very good. In just over 20 days, Dawei was able to see fingers from four meters away, and people standing in the middle of the lawn and the windows opposite could be seen. Professor Fuchs said: "In a few months, his eyesight will gradually recover, but now he has to learn to use the help of his eyes to walk and see things. After the membrane is clear, he can distinguish the bait color." In fact, Dawei was able to correctly identify seven or eight of the colors of the scarves worn by many reporters he saw yesterday. He can also speak some not-too-bad English and knows a few English words. After this, he will start to study Chinese well and read formally.</p>
<p>In addition, another person looking forward to seeing the light again is a mountain boy named Shao Encheng, who is seven years old this year, and will have surgery within the next week. Let's pray for him so that this child can also escape the dark world.</p>
<p>Meagerly Operated School for the Blind</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Road School for the Blind was founded 35 years ago by the British man, Mr. Fryer. When it first opened, it had funds of US$70,000 and 50,000 taels of silver. Later, it bought some stocks and relied on interest to maintain it. Today, it has reached the point of exhaustion. After the old Mr. Fryer died, his son George inherited his father's ambition and continued to run it. Now he is going to the United Kingdom and the United States to study new education methods, preparing to return and give greater benefits to blind children in China. During his absence from the school, it is represented by Bao Sang, and Vice President He Zijian has been serving at the school for more than 30 years, asking questions about child-rearing education and doing his best.</p>
<p>School Building Is Clean Everywhere</p>
<p>When the reporters were led to visit the School for the Blind, they found that everything was extremely clean. Professor Fuchs repeatedly said to the reporters that the first thing that surprised and moved him when he first came was that the school was very clean everywhere. He said that he had never seen a blind place that was so clean, and that these tasks of tidying up the grass and trees, moving stones, and sweeping were all done by the blind children themselves. At this time, he was busy introducing Ms. Ye Chonghua, the director of the girls' department, and Mrs. Bao, saying that they were both the results of their supervision. In the middle of the courtyard, the places where you turn the corner are all paved with stones (the rest is cement), which is specially used as a sign for blind children to walk.</p>
<p>When Leaving, He Had Endless Emotions</p>
<p>The school's expenses are very tight, and the handicrafts made by the students can be sold at the school, but the income is very limited. Their standard for fees is that those who have money pay, and those who cannot are exempt. According to regulations, the tuition and accommodation fee for half a year is 410,000 yuan, but only one-tenth can pay. Therefore, all expenses can only rely on donations to survive. Acting Principal Bao showed a sad face and accompanied the reporters to visit the only broken typewriter in the school, saying: This typewriter is really 20 years old. If you want to teach students to learn to type, but there is no money to buy a typewriter, I hope to borrow a corner of the newspaper to appeal to any typewriter store to donate one or two old typewriters, which can also be used reluctantly, which will be very beneficial to the students.</p>
<p>When we watched a group of innocent and lively children. Standing in the sun and playing, but they can't see the sun, everyone's heart will be filled with a sad and regrettable mood, we hope that there will be many Professor Fuchs in the world to save every blind person from the darkness.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Wharf Labor Dispute: Mediation Failed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor dispute over the scramble for wharf labor at the Taikoo Company has not yet been resolved. Mayor Wu recently summoned labor leaders Chen Shanyu and Zhou Ruisun, among others, to mediate the dispute. Zhou Ruisun was ordered to be detained after making disparaging remarks against officials, and Mayor Wu has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to be responsible for handling his outstanding matters and has ordered Chen Shanyu to use more experienced workers. Zhao Banfu, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically convened negotiations between Chen and Zhou at noon yesterday in the office of Deputy Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Chen Shanyu, Zheng Ziliang, Cai Wen'er, Hou Mengfang, Zhou Chengxiang, and others. On the Taikoo Company side, except for Chen Shanyu, all were Zhou's workers. The meeting was chaired by Director Zhao, who briefly stated that legal matters would not be discussed at today's meeting, but rather matters of friendship. In order to resolve the matter, Chen Shanyu was asked to propose a good strategy so that a satisfactory result could be achieved. Zhou's workers dispersed in a huff because Chen Shanyu did not make any response at the time, resulting in the meeting being fruitless. The Social Affairs Bureau will report to the mayor again, requesting that he find a solution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tobacco Industry Union Welcomes Zhou Xuexiang's Return to China</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the factory unions and the first, second, third, and fourth district unions of the Shanghai tobacco industry jointly held a tea party at the Atlantic Restaurant to welcome Mr. Zhou Xuehu, who had attended the International Labor Conference and returned to China.

<h3>A Complete Record of the History of Shanghai City</h3>
<p>— Special Article by This Newspaper</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, people who came to Shanghai for sightseeing considered it a strange thing that there were no city walls. Shanghai was at the forefront of adopting new trends, and it had already implemented the demolition of the city walls and the construction of roads after the change of dynasty. Although demolishing the city walls in Shanghai was easier than in other places, building them was inferior. It was built in the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty due to disturbances by Japanese pirates, and it was not until the third year of the Republic of China that the reconstruction of the roads was completed, a history of only 360 years.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai was a desolate beach, inhabited only by a very small number of fishermen. It was not until the twenty-ninth year of the Zhizheng reign of the Yuan Dynasty that it was renamed Shanghai County. Even after being renamed a county, it took another 261 years before the county town was built. This was because the people of the coastal areas were strong and brave, often practiced martial arts, and were able to defend themselves, so pirates did not dare to visit easily. Moreover, there were not many officials at that time, and the finances were meager, so it was impossible to raise the funds for building the city. Therefore, they spent more than 200 years under the open door policy.</p>
<p>By the middle of the Ming Dynasty, commerce was flourishing, the number of households gradually increased, and wealthy families also moved to the county seat. At that time, Japanese pirates roamed the seas, and Shanghai had also been visited several times. On the nineteenth day of the fourth month of the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign, Japanese pirates arrived again, their forces were very rampant, and they attacked places such as Zheng Lianbin Bridge. The county magistrate Yu Xianke fled, and the county was severely ravaged. In the fifth month, the Gaochangdu naval forces were defeated by Japanese pirates, the citizens fled, allowing them to plunder at will, and the county government office was reduced to ashes. In the sixth month, pirates from Jinshan sailed in ships to threaten Shanghai. In two months, they suffered consecutive disasters, so the officials and citizens began to realize the importance of defense, and then proposed the construction of the city.</p>
<p>Before the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign, the local gentleman Gu Congli had requested to build the city, but it was not reviewed by the Ministry of Works. The Japanese pirates had already arrived, so it was not built. At that time, Shanghai repeatedly suffered from pirate disasters, causing great pain and suffering. Fang Lian, the prefect of Songjiang, saw the people suffering miserably from plunder and proposed building the city. So he gathered the people to plan, collect land taxes, and take out the surplus from the treasury to cover the expenses. He ordered the assistant magistrate Li Guoji to supervise the construction, and immediately surveyed the site and started construction in the ninth month, rushing to build day and night, and it was completed in two months.</p>
<p>When discussing the construction of the city, wealthy families were unwilling to demolish their houses and donate land because property prices were quite high, so there were many opponents. Later, many gentlemen who understood the principles and were eager to do good deeds for the public first donated funds to demolish their houses to help with the construction, so that the opponents had no excuse and had to obey the will of the people and reluctantly support it. The expenses were insufficient, so they relied on donations from the locals. Among them, Wang Xiangyao was the first person to demolish his house and donate land, contributing all his wealth to help with the project. Although the city was built, he had changed from rich to poor. Gong Sheng Zhang Pan not only scattered his family property to help, but also personally held armor and participated in the work, eventually dying from overwork. Lady Mei, the wife of Lu Wenyu, donated 2,000 taels of silver and destroyed thousands of houses in the market, which was also rare among women.</p>
<p>This newly built Shanghai county town had a circumference of nine li, a height of two zhang and four chi, and six city gates: Chaozong, Kualong, Yifeng, Yanhai, Baodai, and Chaoyang. There were only three water gates: one each across the Zhaojiabang in the east and west, and another across the Fangbang. The city wall had more than 3,600 battlements and two watchtowers. The city moat was more than 1,500 zhang long, six zhang wide, and one zhang and seven chi deep, surrounding the city and connected to the tides. In the first month of the second year after the city walls were built, Japanese pirates arrived, approaching the city. But this time, with the city walls, the investigating censor Dong Bangzheng closed the city and defended it firmly, and the Japanese pirates were never able to enter the city. After that, they were attacked many times, but they did not break into the city.</p>
<h3>A Casual Talk About the East and West City Gates: One is an International Trade Market, the Other is a Gathering Place for Religions</h3>
<p>Shanghai City is located east of the Huangpu River. Before the concessions were opened, the county town was the most bustling place. Ships came along the Huangpu River, and the Pudong waterfront of the city became the focus of the dock. Therefore, there was an international trade market here very early. The Xiaodongmen (Small East Gate) and Dadongmen (Great East Gate) were places where merchants gathered.</p>
<p>Now, outside of Minguo Road, between Zhoushan Road and Gaoqiao Road, there is a short road called Yanghang Street, which is the earliest place where foreign firms concentrated. This Yanghang Street was already recorded in the Shanghai County Chronicles revised in the nineteenth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, which shows its long history. At the same time, Yanghang Street became famous not after the opening of the five ports for trade. In the beginning, there were two parallel streets, Inner Yanghang Street and Outer Yanghang Street, but now only one remains.</p>
<p>Old Site of the Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Customs was also initially located outside the East Gate. When the sea ban was abolished in the twenty-third year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the customs was established in the following year, called the "Jianghai Great Customs." Facing the Huangpu River and sitting in the middle, ships entering the port had to pass through there. In the twenty-third year of the Daoguang reign, Shanghai was opened as a commercial port, and then British and French expatriates opened concessions in the north of the city. As a result, the commerce in the northern part of the city gradually flourished, and the prosperity of the southern part of the city was gradually taken away. The Shanghai Daotai then built a new customs house outside the North Gate, also known as the North Customs. The Great Customs at Xiaodongmen became the South Customs, also known as the Old Customs.</p>
<p>As for the West Gate, the first thing that should be mentioned is Huangjiaque Road, which was the former residence of Huang Ming in the Yuan Dynasty. His residence was called Xijiao Yequxuan (West Suburban Wild Interest Pavilion), and people called him Mr. Xijiao (Mr. West Suburb). At that time, although Shanghai had been established as a county, there was still no county town. The county seat was located in the center of the old city, so "Xijiao" (West Suburb) was equivalent to the later "outside the West Gate."</p>
<p>Temple of Literature Park</p>
<p>The Temple of Literature Park is particularly beneficial for people living in the Ximen (West Gate) area, just like the convenience for people living near Zhongshan Park and Fuxing Park. The Temple of Literature was originally a building to commemorate Confucius, and every city and county in the country has one. Shanghai's Temple of Literature has a history of more than 600 years, but in those 600 years, the temple site has changed five times. The current Temple of Literature was built only more than 80 years ago, after Shanghai opened as a port. Initially, the town school was changed to a county school in the first year of the Zhenyuan reign of the Yuan Dynasty (1295), located northeast of Fangbang Bridge and Changsheng Bridge. Soon after, it was moved to the current Jingye Road, and the temple base was slightly expanded. In the third year of the Zhida reign (1310), it was decided to move again, purchasing more than 50 mu of farmland in the Xiangsha field area to build a new school palace, and the Temple of Literature began to be related to the West Gate. In the first year of the Yanyou reign (1314), the county magistrate Wang Gui moved it back to its old home. This time it lasted a long time, and the temple site became more and more grand, safely passing through more than 500 years. Until the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1853), the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai County, and the Temple of Literature became their headquarters for issuing orders. When the Small Swords Society withdrew, the temple's halls and ancestral halls were almost completely destroyed. After the war was quelled, construction was started to rebuild it, which is the current Temple of Literature. The Temple of Literature moved several times between the east and west gates, and finally returned to the West Gate.</p>
<p>Ten Directions Forest of Karma</p>
<p>The West Gate can be said to be a gathering place for religions. In addition to the Temple of Literature, the center of Confucianism, there is also a center of Taoism, namely the Baiyun Temple on Fangxie Road, which was founded in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign (1882). Initially, it was just a small Leizu Temple. After six years, it received the Taoist canon and was modeled after the example of the Baiyun Temple in Beijing, and was named "Ten Directions Forest of Karma," and renamed Baiyun Temple.</p>
<p>Christianity also had a share in the West Gate. There was a Biwen Girls' School and a Women's and Children's Hospital, both run by the church. Biwen Girls' School was established in memory of Bi Zhwen, an American Congregational minister. The Women's and Children's Hospital was founded by Rose Nader, a missionary of the American Women's Missionary Society, in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. These two undertakings run by the church, together with the Temple of Literature and Baiyun Temple, formed a three-legged balance in the West Gate.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate) – A Little Anecdote</h3>
<p>The Xiaonanmen existed when the county town was first built, as written clearly in the Wanli County Chronicles. Another theory is that it was opened for the Yu Linglong stone in the Yuyuan Garden of the Town God Temple, which seems to have been after the other five gates. But calculating it, this matter is not far from the Jiajing renovation of the city, that is, before Wanli, which is also inconsistent with the facts. Let's write it down for now, so that people who study Shanghai's history can verify it.</p>
<p>Yuyuan Garden was originally the villa of Pan En, a Ming Dynasty minister. There is a Xiangxuetang (Fragrant Snow Hall) inside, which is one of the famous scenic spots in the garden. There are three large stones in front of the hall, all of which are very precious. Among them, the one named Yu Linglong is the largest, more than ten feet high, with a cyan-black color and ten thousand holes, which is even more precious.</p>
<p>This stone was originally an old object of the Nanyuan Garden in Sanlinzhuang, Pudong. When Chu Yu retired to the forest, he often stroked this stone for self-entertainment. He once put an incense burner at the bottom of the stone, and green smoke curled out of every hole in the stone. He also poured a basin of water from the top of the stone, and water flowed from all the holes in the stone. The name Yu Linglong is truly not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Chu Yu and Pan En were relatives by marriage. Chu's daughter married Pan's son Yunliang. After Chu died without an heir, Yunliang moved this Yu Linglong stone to his own Yuyuan Garden.</p>
<p>Sanlinzhuang is more than ten miles away from Shanghai County, and there is a river between them. It cost a lot of money to transport this stone. Unexpectedly, when crossing the river, a storm broke out, and the welcoming boat and the stone sank into the river together. So they hired good swimmers to search underwater, and used huge ropes to tie the stone and drag it ashore. At that time, there was another stone at the bottom of the water, which was also picked up when tying the rope. It turned out to be the base of the Yu Linglong stone. The coincidence of nature is truly a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>After the Yu Linglong stone and its base were dragged ashore, they also complained that the road to the city gate was too far. At that time, the local gentry were powerful and directly destroyed the city walls to enter. This gap in the city wall that was destroyed because of Yu Linglong was not only never repaired afterwards, but was instead changed into a city gate, which is the Xiaonanmen.</p>
<h3>Demolishing the City Walls and Filling the Moats to Build Roads: Several Twists and Turns, But Finally Completed</h3>
<p>Cao Xiang's Compromise Solution</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, the situation in Shanghai changed greatly, and the demolition of the city walls was once again paid attention to. Petitions were submitted to the two governors of Suzhou and Shanghai and the civil administrator of Shanghai County, which were subsequently approved.</p>
<p>After the approval, the City Moat Road Engineering Office was established, with the county civil administrator Wu Jing serving as the director, and the mayor Mo Xilun as the deputy director. In addition to the councilors, there were also general affairs, engineering, land, and negotiation departments. The entire project was estimated to cost about 300,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan had already been raised, starting with the demolition of the northern half of the city.</p>
<p>The Property Protection Association Rose Up to Obstruct</p>
<p>The demolition of the city walls did not proceed smoothly, and there were several twists and turns in the middle. The first was the Property Protection Association organized by the tenants of the city moat, which rose up to obstruct it. According to convention, the public land of the city moat was managed by the defense camp, which summoned people to lease it to subsidize military expenses. When the demolition of the city walls was proposed at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Property Protection Association appeared and showed its skills in the competition between the autonomous office of the urban area under the county and the stationed Green Battalion for the public property of the city moat. At this time, they again used the excuse that the city moat was military land, and disobeyed the order to move, and then demanded to change the narrow road line and set the rental price early, with a surging momentum, threatening to make trouble for those who demolished it. The authorities remained calm in dealing with it. Except for slightly narrowing the section from Xiaodongmen along the city wall to Danfenglou, the issue of the ownership of the city moat was resolved through consultation with Su Dudu Cheng Dequan and Zhu Dabin, the director of the Jiangsu Water and Land Joint Public Property Bureau, and was managed by the county government. The storm subsided.</p>
<p>The British Military Cemetery Prevented the Road Line</p>
<p>Secondly: On the city wall of the northern half of the city, there was a British military cemetery that blocked the road line. The diplomatic authorities repeatedly requested the British consul to choose another site to relocate, but the British consul insisted on changing the straight road line, which almost led to a breakdown. Later, the municipal government found the case of the Public Works Department building a road in Chengdu Road North, so it asked the county government to forward it to the diplomatic envoy for discussion. As a result, the Chinese cemetery with 1.74% of the land on Datong Road was exchanged for the land given up by the British military cemetery. The problem was finally resolved, but the exchange of official documents had delayed a lot of time.</p>
<p>Demolishing the Walls and Filling the Moat to Reconstruct the Road</p>
<p>Another matter was the negotiation with the French Concession. The northern half of the city was originally adjacent to the French Concession. During the normal construction of demolishing the city walls and building roads, the issue of road rights arose again. After consultation between the county magistrate and the French consul, seven articles of the "Joint Measures for the Management of the China-France Road by the Nanshi Municipal Government and the French Municipal Council" were signed, with an attached explanation, and then four additional articles were added. The division of the boundary line and the management rights were separately stipulated. Demolishing the walls and filling the moat to reconstruct the road.</p>
<p>The project started in July of the first year of the Republic of China. While demolishing the city walls, they filled in the city moat and the river, and reconstructed the road. The pavement of the northern half of the city was 850 zhang long, and it was not completed until June of the second year of the Republic of China. While negotiating with the British and French consuls, the demolition project of the southern half of the city was already underway. By the time the pavement of the northern half of the city was completed, it was 890 zhang long, and it was completed in the winter of the third year of the Republic of China. The pavement of the southern half of the city is called Zhonghua Road, and the northern half is called Minguo Road. The current "Shangwen Road," "Fuyou Road," and "Zhaojia Road" are memorials to the city gates of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Remaining Base Land: Surrender the Price and Accept the Lead</p>
<p>The base land remaining from filling the moat and building the road was a total of more than 140 mu. After the Shanghai magistrate presented it to the provincial government, it was approved to be surrendered to the local autonomous group for a price to make up for the missing funds. During the recall period, in order to prevent private sales to foreigners and cause negotiations, the county government sent a letter to the diplomatic envoy to forward it to the land bureau, prohibiting the conversion of land deeds within the city and issuing a general notice to the bookkeepers to comply. In May of the third year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance ordered the establishment of a city moat official property measurement and release bureau. The director general of the bureau, Tao Xiang, and the co-organizer, Zhu Junbi, implemented the sale, abolished the road engineering office, and simultaneously cancelled the land that had been previously accepted, and the total land price was returned. The measurement and release bureau ended in the fifth year of the Republic of China. A total of more than 1.2 million taels of silver were collected for land prices. In addition to the project costs, Zheng Rucheng, the garrison commander of Shanghai, used 300,000 yuan in the name of work relief, and the remaining funds were all transferred to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>The Demolition of the City was not Completed, Adding City Gates: Wanting to Maintain the Old and Preserve the City Walls, and also Wanting to Promote the Prosperity of the Market</h3>
<p>Cao Xiang's Compromise Solution</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea ban, Western ships have been strong and cannons have been sharp. This ancient city wall is no longer enough to defend, but has become a burden on commercial development. Therefore, there is a proposal to demolish the city.</p>
<p>In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the county gentleman Yao Wenyan and others requested the Shanghai Daotai Yuan Shuxun to play a special role, citing the Tianjin case, allowing the demolition of the city walls and the transformation of the road to facilitate transportation. At that time, Daotai Yuan was very sympathetic, but conservative gentlemen still rose up to oppose it, and it was never approved by the two governors of Liangjiang.</p>
<p>The plan to demolish the city could not be realized, but the prosperity of the northern city was increasing day by day, and the city must be constantly improved. The following year (the first year of Xuantong), Cao Rang proposed a compromise solution, that is, to open city gates to allow vehicles to pass through. After several discussions, the government finally permitted it, and construction started from the Xiaoximen first.</p>
<p>This new city gate is about three miles north of the Dananmen. A large hole was made in the city wall, 14 feet high and 16 feet wide, with a crescent shape on top, titled Shangwen, and two iron gates were added. At that time, the manual expenses were estimated at more than 2,000 taels of silver, and one city guard was set up.</p>
<p>After the Shangwenmen was completed, the Gongchen and Fuyou gates were added, all of which were completed in the second year of Xuantong. Therefore, in addition to the original six gates and the Xinbeimen (New North Gate) added during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, Shanghai City added three more gates.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Documents to Various Provinces and Cities: Discussing Comprehensive Price Controls, Measures to be Taken Against Excessive Floating Capital</h3>
<p>Affected by the recent gold and banknote fluctuations, the prices of essential daily necessities in various places have risen uniformly, such as rice, oil, sugar, and miscellaneous grains, all showing alarming increases, becoming more and more serious, and having a profound and significant impact on people's livelihoods. The way to suppress and stabilize prices urgently requires a comprehensive price control policy. It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already sent documents to various provinces and cities, soliciting suggestions and opinions on price controls for reference and implementation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau of this city yesterday drafted a letter of suggestions and opinions on controlling prices in this city. It is reported that it advocates strictly restricting the prices of raw materials in producing areas based on quality, and also advocates strengthening the implementation of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is said that these price control measures are expected to be announced and implemented in the next few days.</p>
<p>The recent price increases in this city have many reasons, but the overabundance of floating capital and the unusually loose money supply are also major causes. In recent days, the amount of money remitted to Shanghai from various places has been increasing, gathering in the gold and commodity markets, which has caused a sharp rise in prices. It is learned that the authorities have taken appropriate measures to prevent the concentration of floating capital in this city. The Central Bank has recently imposed strict restrictions on the amount of weekly remittances to Shanghai from various commercial banks and firms. If the amount exceeds the prescribed standard, they must state the reasons to the Central Bank, and the remittance will only be allowed after the bank's approval. The exchange rates of remittances from various places are also regularly adjusted to strengthen the implementation of management work.</p>
<h3>A Small Number of Improper Manufacturers: Using Loans for Speculation</h3>
<p>Lending Banks and Firms Have Dispatched Personnel for Spot Checks and Have Found Evidence: It is Decided to Recall the Loans in Advance and Request Punishment</p>
<p>Previously, government financial institutions had held various loans one after another in order to relieve industry and commerce, so that industry and commerce could obtain funds and resume production after the war. Unexpectedly, some manufacturers borrowed funds and used the loans for speculative businesses and hoarding goods for improper purposes. It is learned that the authorities have discovered the secret, and have dispatched auditors from various lending banks and firms to conduct spot checks on the borrowing manufacturers. As a result, it has been found in this city and Zhenjiang that there are indeed many manufacturers who have used loans for improper purposes. The authorities believe that this kind of action not only violates the purpose of holding loans, but also promotes the bad trend of speculation. Therefore, the banks and firms plan to recall the loans from these manufacturers in advance, and at the same time submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on punishment measures. It is also learned that the authorities attach great importance to the recent surge in gold prices and its relationship to the flow of loans into the speculative market. They are currently planning countermeasures and will severely crack down on these improper manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Pig Bristles Exported to England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] In 1946, a total of 10,684 dan of pig bristles were imported into the UK from China, valued at £1,500,000. In 1945, it was 5,575 dan, valued at £680,000, and in 1938, it was 17,589 dan, valued at £460,000. These figures represent 70%, 60%, and 50% of the total value of UK pig bristle imports, respectively.</p>
<h3>A Total of 564 Financial Institutions in this City</h3>
<p>With the influx of floating capital into Shanghai from various places, there have been many newly established financial institutions in this city in recent months. According to statistics from the Audit Department of the Central Bank, as of recently, there are a total of 564 various financial institutions in this city. Among them, commercial banks are the most numerous, with a total of 206. Qianzhuang (money shops) are the second most numerous, with a total of 92. There are a total of 61 state-run and province-run banks and branch offices, 6 county and city-run banks, 7 yinhao (silver shops), 13 trust companies, and 131 insurance companies, totaling 564. The authorities are paying close attention to the use of funds by various banks and firms, and are currently stepping up inspections. If it is found that they are secretly participating in speculative manipulation, they will be dealt with severely according to law.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Wine Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Shaoxing wine is one of the special products of Zhejiang Province, produced in Shaoxing and sold in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hebei, and Tianjin. During its heyday before the war, the output could reach 300,000 jars per year, with each jar containing 500 jin. Due to the destruction by the enemy and puppets, the output after the war is less than one-tenth or two-tenths of that. According to the Goods Tax Bureau's investigation, only more than 25,000 jars were produced last year, and the selling price is determined by the year of manufacture. The newly manufactured ones last year were only 40,000 yuan. Since the Lunar New Year, the price of raw material glutinous rice has risen, and the price has increased by 30%. Each bian (50 jin) of new goods is 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, three-year-old Chenshao is more than 80,000, five-year-old Huadiao is between 100,000 and 130,000, ten-year-old Taidiao is 160,000, and those over 15 years old have no fixed price. The export situation is still good. Last year, about 70,000 jars were sold to Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangxi and other places. According to those familiar with the matter, if the traffic in various places recovers, it can catch up with the heyday before the war in two or three years.</p>
<h3>Orchid and Bamboo Branch Prices Rise</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's telegram from the producing area, high-quality orchid and bamboo branches have risen by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Good goods such as Kuilan bamboo require 330,000 to 340,000 yuan, so the inventory in Shanghai is gradually becoming tight, but actual sales have not moved, and it is not easy to be too high for a while.</p>
<h3>Longan Turns Upward</h3>
<p>A large number of miscellaneous large-grain longan, called Fang, has been opened for more than one hundred pieces. Because the market is quite appetizing, the price has tightened, and it has risen by about 20,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Filament Shortage</h3>
<p>Tungsten filament, the main raw material for manufacturing light bulbs, has recently been difficult to obtain due to the lack of American goods and the dwindling inventory in the Northeast, as well as difficulties in searching and carrying. Osaka merchants are hesitant to move forward, so the goods arriving are becoming scarcer and scarcer, and the inventory in the market is gradually lacking. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and the prices are getting higher and higher.</p>
<h3>Southbound Yarn Market Applies for Permit: Textile Control Commission to Start Handling This Week</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The Textile Control Commission has decided to start handling applications for permits for southbound yarn and cloth for this month starting this week. The amount of southbound transportation has been approved at the regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission on the 6th, namely 5,546 pieces of yarn and 133,299 bolts of cloth. For special projects, there are 2,400 pieces of yarn and 59,679 bolts of cloth.</p>
<p>In addition, the commission's purchase of cotton yarn will also be distributed batch by batch starting this week. The approved purchase notices will allow each yarn factory to submit the stack receipt and receive payment. The commission's inspection and sampling work has already been completed for 16 factories. However, because there are as many as 100 types of cotton yarn, it has been decided to find ways to complete the inspection work next week to facilitate the purchase work.</p>
<h3>Black Market for US Dollars Soars: Export Industry Not Optimistic: Export Goods are Smuggled to Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Since the promulgation of the export subsidy measures, the prices of China's main exports have soared. Pig bristles are quoted at 1.8 million yuan per dan, an increase of 60% to 70% compared to before, and there is a price but no market. Tung oil prices have also risen to about 270,000 yuan. According to a person in charge of an export company, at the above prices, even with a 100% subsidy, there will still be losses after export. Therefore, the export of pig bristles and tung oil is not better than before the export subsidy measures were announced. In addition, the black market for US dollars has soared recently, and various export goods have been transferred to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. If the outlet in Hong Kong cannot be cut off, and the government does not have other effective measures for export, then it may be impossible to seek the normalization of China's export business. The effect of this subsidy measure is only to increase the domestic prices of various exports, so that a variety of industries on the verge of collapse can get a slight respite. Its effect on the entire export business is minimal.</p>
<h3>Egg Industry Plans for Export: Lowering Costs through Collective Purchasing</h3>
<p>Since the government announced subsidy measures for export goods, various export trading firms have been actively planning for the export of goods. Egg trading firms in this city are also currently preparing and have already telegraphed importers in the United States and Britain to make contact. Once replies arrive and the market prices are favorable, they plan to ship large quantities for export. According to Zheng Yuanxing, General Manager of Maochang Foreign Firm, egg product exports were substantial before the war, with five categories: fresh chicken eggs, frozen eggs, egg yolks, egg whites, and dried egg sheets. Before the war, the annual export of fresh chicken eggs was 400,000 cases, with 360 eggs per case. Frozen eggs were 40,000 to 50,000 tons, and egg yolks, egg whites, and dried egg sheets were 5,000 tons, with a current value of about 200 billion yuan. After the war, due to production being less than half of pre-war levels, egg product exports were only about one-third of pre-war exports. If civilian production increases and inland transportation becomes smooth, it is hoped to restore the previous state within two years. Recently, the import price of fresh eggs in the United States is USD 0.33 to 0.35 per dozen, while the retail price is USD 0.50 to 0.60. Britain has agreed to import one-third of our pre-war export volume, but prices are still under negotiation. Currently, the overseas market price and the domestic purchase price, even with subsidies, still have a 50% difference. To achieve balance, either prices need to be raised overseas, or purchase prices must be lowered. Once negotiations are settled, a meeting with industry members will be convened to discuss concrete details. Plans are also being made to lower costs and engage in collective purchasing to increase exports.</p>
<h3>Spring Overcoat Fabrics Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overall trend of woolen fabrics remained firm, with standard market prices holding both overtly and covertly. Fine wool, lustrous woolens, and patterned woolens were even more popular, with both wholesale and retail prices rising. Spring overcoat fabrics like Harris Tweeds, Homespuns, Four-Ply Herringbone, etc., saw active sales, especially with Hangzhou merchants making eager purchases. The transaction price of the Shanghai-produced Harris Tweed was from 30,000 to 55,000 yuan per yard, and Herringbone from 18,000 to 65,000 yuan. Imported Four-Ply Homespun was quoted at 140,000 yuan for the top grade, 110,000 yuan for the second grade, and 75,000 yuan for the third grade. Yuanfeng-branded Xuangwei woolen fabric with markings was 85,000 yuan, without markings 82,500 yuan, 777-striped Xuangwei 95,000 yuan, and 555-branded patterned woolen fabric 100,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Raise Funds to Purchase Rice for Relief in Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou dispatch, 9th] Since the Spring Festival, the price of rice in Guangzhou has surged from 60,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) to break through the 100,000 yuan mark. Other commodity prices have also risen simultaneously, causing widespread suffering among citizens. According to a spokesperson from the provincial government, the reasons for the rice price increase are: first, the rise in gold and foreign currency; second, the increasing smuggling of rice. The provincial authorities are currently holding daily meetings to prevent the outflow of grain and stabilize rice prices. Furthermore, Huang Kaiying, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Relief Association for the Motherland's Famine in South Vietnam, recently met with Chairman Luo to report that the association has raised 40 million Vietnamese dong to purchase 4,000 tons of rice, of which 500 tons are designated for Fujian and 2,500 tons for Guangdong for relief. Export procedures are currently being processed in Vietnam. Amidst the rice shortage, this is truly a blessing for the people of Guangdong and Fujian.</p>
<h3>Book Industry Resolves to Raise Prices: Calculated at 1400 Times the Original Price</h3>

<h3>British Imports of Raw Silk: China Accounts for Slightly Less Than One-Tenth</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] In 1946, British imports of raw silk totaled only 326,109 pounds, compared to 576,411 pounds in 1945 and 5,296,860 pounds in 1938. The respective values were £1,140,000, £1,750,000, and £1,920,000. The largest quantity was imported from Italy, totaling 270,883 pounds, valued at £981,818 (compared to 170,498 pounds in 1945, valued at £509,603, and 142,218 pounds in 1938, valued at £56,320). Imports from China totaled 27,746 pounds, valued at £11,975 (compared to 124,676 pounds in 1945, valued at £386,153, and 278,534 pounds in 1938, valued at £85,391).</p>

<h3>New Great Weaving Factory: Rumor of Chuan Liangjun Taking Over</h3>
<p>The "New Great Weaving Factory," which was liquidated on December 5th of last year, was a large-scale operation located on Xinfengzhou Road in Nanshi, covering an estimated 12-13 mu (a unit of area) of land and housing 500-600 rooms with over 400 silk weaving machines. At the time, various circles expressed regret. Although the labor and management sides went through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Besides high-interest loans, labor disputes were also a major factor in the liquidation.</p>
<p>It is reported that recently, the factory has negotiated a takeover with Mr. Chuan Liangjun of the "New Light" company. A draft agreement has been signed, and the takeover process is currently underway.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on the Import Quota Allocation System</h3>
<p>— Infantryman</p>
<p>The quota allocation system represents a significant shift in trade policy. It directly restricts the quantity or value of certain imported goods in order to protect or aid domestic industries, improve international lending, and implement exchange control. Therefore, it is a key industrial protection policy. However, compared to the protection policies that have been implemented in the past, it has many entirely new characteristics.</p>
<p>First, it directly limits the quantity of imported goods. Traditional protection policies, such as nurturing tariffs for nascent industries, cartel tariffs for protecting monopolistic industries, or so-called relief tariffs for maintaining general industries, all used tariffs as a tool for protection. This involved directly increasing the import price of foreign goods through increased tariffs, and indirectly reducing the quantity of imported goods, in order to protect domestic industries. However, this indirect method has recently become less effective in the current international economic climate. Because the gold standard has been suspended and exchange rates have depreciated, tariffs may not necessarily increase the price of imported goods under so-called exchange dumping. Moreover, even if the price of imported goods can be increased, it may not necessarily limit the quantity of imports due to differences in commodity types. Therefore, the desire to achieve appropriate import restrictions has led to the creation of the quota allocation system, which uses a direct method to limit the quantity of imported goods.</p>
<p>Second, it is not merely a method of implementing import restrictions. It places a specific limit on the quantity or value of imported goods from the outset. Because indirect restrictions using tariffs cannot definitively determine the extent to which import quantities can be limited, the quota allocation system determines the quantity of goods to be allowed for import from abroad after considering the domestic consumption and domestic production of a certain commodity. It then decides how to allocate this determined total import volume. This includes (1) external allocation – whether to allocate equally or proportionally to importing countries; (2) internal allocation – how to determine the import volume for each domestic importer; and (3) seasonal allocation – how to appropriately divide the total import volume into monthly or quarterly import quantities. The above items not only restrict the quantity of imports, but also add a sense of allocation, hence the name quota allocation system.</p>
<p>Third, since its introduction, the quota allocation system has been implemented as a temporary measure through emergency legal actions in many countries. In other words, it is a matter of administrative order rather than law. This is also one of its characteristics. When tariffs are used to restrict imports, the increase in tariffs is in principle a matter of law because tariffs are similar to taxes (except for sliding-scale tariffs). However, the quota allocation system does not require special legislation and is often implemented through emergency orders. For example, Article 3 of the French Tariff Law of 1910 recognizes the right and obligation of the French government to take emergency measures to counter any actions by foreign governments that may hinder French trade. The French government has implemented the quota allocation system for many commodities based on this provision. Therefore, it is generally accompanied by a time limit and is a temporary restriction, usually lasting no more than a year. We should note that the quota allocation system is merely a temporary and exceptional emergency measure, not any significant change in trade policy. However, there are now many people who argue otherwise. Therefore, this temporary emergency measure tends to gradually transform into a permanent and established system.</p>
<p>There are also many relevant issues in the implementation of the quota allocation system:</p>
<p>First: Does the implementation of the quota allocation system conflict with the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause? This has been a subject of discussion in the League of Nations. The answer largely depends on the content of the quota allocation. Some cases violate the MFN clause, while others do not. For example, stipulating the rate of land imports for neighboring countries does not, in fact, cause any harm to distant third countries. Similarly, allocating import ratios to various countries based on reasonable past standards and fair proportions cannot be said to violate the MFN clause in substance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Expulsion for False Credentials: Female Student He Fangling Disappears from Hubei Women's Normal School; Ministry of Education Orders Original School to Search for Her</h3>
<p>Remaining Students with False Credentials Temporarily Allowed to Audit Classes</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 9th] Hubei student He Guojie suggested to the Ministry of Education that schools and educational bureaus should prioritize academic performance and abolish the credential system after his sister, He Fangling, a student at the Hubei Provincial Second Women's Normal School, disappeared after being expelled for false credentials. The Hubei Provincial Department of Education, because seven other students were also expelled for false credentials at the same time, requested permission to temporarily allow them to audit classes and specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education ordered the department to instruct the principal of the original school, along with the student's parents, to jointly search for the missing student He Fangling. As for the remaining seven students, as their credentials were not genuine, it was inconvenient to approve their student status. They are temporarily allowed to audit classes, and if they pass the end-of-year examinations, their formal student status may be approved. According to a certain educator, this is an issue worth studying. If a student possesses equivalent academic ability and excellent performance, but is expelled solely due to false credentials, it can be said to be legal but not reasonable. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, two types of students have emerged: (1) those whose families are in occupied areas and do not want to work for the enemy, and who study on their own under the guidance of their fathers, brothers, or private tutors; (2) those who, in times of extremely high tuition fees, are unable to afford education due to poverty and study on their own in their spare time. The academic abilities of these two types of students are often no less than those of students from schools, but their only shortcoming is insufficient credentials when applying for further education. For the sake of cherishing these diligent young people, the educational authorities seem to have a need to provide remedies.</p>

<h3>Students of Sino-French Middle School Demand to Repeat Grade: Oppose Demotion</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Sino-French Middle School Protection Association held a reception for reporters at the Huazhong Road Youth Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday. Liu Jisheng, Chen Ruiliang, Zeng Yiliang, Pan Jinlong, Cao Xiuzhou, and other student representatives of the association stated that although the principal of the Sino-French Middle School is a Chinese national, Ma Yunxiang, the power is still wielded by the French principal of the Mother's Academy, Jules. Its educational methods still follow the style of the past concession era, and the oppression of students is extreme. This time, more than 60 of the 80 students in the second year of high school were demoted (i.e., demoted from the first semester of the second year of high school to the second semester of the first year of high school, or even to the third year of junior high school; first-year high school students were demoted to the third year of junior high school). They have made four demands to the school authorities and the Municipal Education Bureau: (1) to repeat the grade without being demoted (i.e., those who were originally in the first semester of the second year of high school should remain in the original grade); (2) to make up for past missed classes; (3) to use Mandarin Chinese to teach subjects such as geometry and algebra, except for French; and (4) to hope that the school will reform and adopt student opinions. They also said that the Municipal Education Bureau has promised to investigate and reply, but since the Sino-French Middle School has already started school today, the students are impatient and, in order to avoid the pain of dropping out of school, appeal to people from all walks of life for assistance.</p>

<h3>Group A Football Second Round: Youyou Suffers Crushing Defeat to Jewish Team: 4-1, Jewish Team Avenges Defeat in First Match; Penalty Kick Saves Youyou from Total Defeat</h3>
<p>[Our report] In the second round of the Group A football league, Youyou suffered a crushing 4-1 defeat to the Jewish team. Youyou conceded four goals in the first half, leading to an insurmountable situation. In the second half, they scored a penalty kick, avoiding a shutout. The Jewish team was able to avenge their defeat in the first match. There were more than 3,000 spectators at Yiyuan, creating a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Jewish Team Scores Four Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>Both sides were evenly matched. Youyou adjusted their midfield and defense, making their defense strong, while the Jewish team also had two defenders, Xipansi Ting and Lisibao, plus McNitti as their goalkeeper, forming a formidable trio. Therefore, the two sides fought fiercely for a quarter of an hour without any gains. However, due to Youyou's midfield being shifted back, losing the ball repeatedly in the middle, Zhang Rongguang was too eager to save the ball and committed a handball inside the boundary at 20 minutes. The Jewish team's Quebisiji took the penalty kick and scored in the corner of the goal. The Jewish team took the lead 1-0. At 35 minutes, the Jewish team's Edward dribbled past alone, and Zhang Rongcai abandoned the city to save, but the ball slowly rolled in, and Youyou lost another goal. The whole army scattered, and the Jewish team's Baojie took the opportunity to score again, making it 3-0. Before the end of the first half, Zhang Rongguang abandoned his post, causing Edward to score again. The Jewish team had an absolute advantage of 4-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Youyou Team Breaks Shutout</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides switched sides and fought again. The Jewish team started with the same lineup, while Youyou replaced Cao Qinfang as the left winger and Yatuomali as the right inside forward, with Zhu Meilong retreating to defend the middle. After the contact, Youyou launched a general counterattack. At two minutes, Cao Lao San single-handedly advanced and shot from 15 yards, but McNitti caught it directly. Not long after, Chen Xiaoping fell and tripped the ball in the penalty area. Si Tuolun intentionally shot at an angle, resulting in a wild shot. At 15 minutes, Lei Shuping broke into the enemy's territory, and Kapusiting was too eager to save the ball and violated the rules. Cao Qinfang took the penalty kick, and the ball went into the net from the left corner, 1-4. Youyou broke the shutout. Although morale improved, McNitti's skills were agile, and he defused the danger one by one. At 20 minutes, McNitti caught the ball and ran four steps, which was ruled as a free kick. Cao Lao San took the free kick, and the ball flew out of bounds. After that, the two sides fought fiercely. The enemy general Edward made several advances, but all failed. As a result, he became angry and took some rough actions, receiving a major warning. When time ran out, the Jewish team defeated Youyou 4-1.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: A Protest Against the "Suicide Education" System!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tingchao</p>
<p>Some Opinions Regarding the Revision of Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Currently, China is experiencing a peculiar phenomenon: on the one hand, there is a surplus of manpower with countless people unemployed; on the other hand, there is a perceived lack of talent, making it difficult to find competent individuals for various jobs. What is the cause of this distorted situation? Leaving aside the negative influences of "lobbying and seeking connections" and "nepotism," the reality tells us that the main reason lies in the impracticality of young people's knowledge. The impracticality of knowledge stems from the flaws in the education system. Consider the thousands upon thousands of secondary school graduates who leave school each year, hoping to serve society. Whether they are high school or junior high school graduates, even those with high grades and excellent performance, what practical work can they actually undertake? Don't they have to start learning everything from scratch? The situation is even worse for those with poor grades and weak performance. Aren't the jokes like "Li Bai was a Ming Dynasty person" and "The capital of Zhejiang is Wu County" a disgrace to educators? If secondary school students are like this, what about university students? It is truly heartbreaking to say that, except for a few specialized institutions, most ordinary organizations get a headache when they see university graduates. A piece of paper and a square hat elevate their worth, but they are completely clueless about practical work. If things continue this way, education will inevitably go bankrupt in the near future, and the so-called "universal education" and "cultivating talent" will never be realized!</p>
<p>The current education system has been in place for over twenty years, and its effects are roughly as described above. Take the curriculum standards, for example. It is said that these standards were initially formulated by the Ministry of Education in consultation with experts from across the country. I remember that when these standards were about to be promulgated, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education convened representatives from various schools in the city to discuss them in groups. I was one of the representatives at the time. After reviewing the curriculum standards, I said at the meeting: "Before examining each item in detail, I have a question—are such heavy curricula suitable for students' health?" The chairman's response was: "These were specially formulated by experts invited by the Ministry of Education, so there probably won't be any mistakes!" Hearing this, I felt both amused and exasperated and immediately left the meeting. This cannot be blamed on the chairman, as there are many such people in all strata of society. In reality, the so-called "expert formulation" is nothing more than gathering a few people of relatively high status, closing the door for discussion, writing whatever comes to mind, relying on their own ideals, aiming high and far, and only seeking superficial beauty, without considering whether it is feasible or what the advantages and disadvantages of implementation are. The so-called "experts" are nothing more than a few high-ranking officials, plus a few returned students with connections! It is no wonder that the curriculum standards formulated under such circumstances are "useless." What is strange is that for so many years, no one has come out to say a word, watching the school education decline day by day without trying to remedy it. This at least proves that all those engaged in education hold the naive view that "these were formulated by experts invited by the Ministry of Education, so there won't be any mistakes." Many people are now advocating "Education First," but if we continue to follow this old path, even with funding and talent, this slogan will remain just a slogan. Therefore, I hope that the Ministry of Education thoroughly re-examines the secondary school education system, formulates new regulations, and ensures that they are practical and adapt to the environment, so that we no longer hear the fallacy of "What is the use of studying?" And the experts hired should not necessarily be high-ranking officials or returned students; the first condition should be good teachers who have at least ten years of classroom experience under the current education system.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcomings of the current curriculum standards are: (1) too much and not thorough enough, (2) neglect of reality. The heavy curricula prescribed by the current standards cannot be handled by people with average intelligence. The purpose of education is not just to create students with outstanding talent, but to create general talents, especially those who are less intelligent, because intelligent people are ultimately a minority! We should not sacrifice the majority of people with lower intelligence in order to suit the abilities of a few intelligent students. Moreover, there are other feasible and appropriate ways to utilize the talents of intelligent students without hindering the less intelligent ones (detailed later). Why must we force the shoe to fit the foot? Consider the many courses that every secondary school student has to take: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, advanced algebra, analytic geometry, biology, chemistry, physics, Chinese, English, history, geography, and civics. And none of these are simple or superficial; on the contrary, they are all quite advanced and detailed. Not to mention those with poor talents, even those with above-average abilities feel overwhelmed. As a result, those who are willing to work hard bury themselves in books day and night, just to cope with exams, without any interest at all. They have no opportunity to absorb some necessary knowledge outside of textbooks, and some even bury their lives in books. Those who are unwilling to work hard are daunted and give up on these many courses, believing that their intelligence cannot cope with them. They harden their hearts and simply ignore them, seeking a way out on the wrong path. This wrong path includes cheating, plagiarism, and substitution, among other dishonest practices. Students who are more disciplined but not good at cheating have no choice but to waste years of their lives and drop out of school halfway. Are all these people incapable of being cultivated? Absolutely not. Among them are many young people with outstanding talents who can be cultivated and developed in certain disciplines. However, these many heavy and impractical subjects tightly bind them, block their path to advancement, and a thousand-mile steed ultimately "dies in the stable." This is a loss to the country, a sin of the education authorities, and a shame to the nation!</p>
<p>Speaking of practicality, generally speaking, how many people in China can receive high school education? High school graduates should be in high demand in society, but in reality, in which sector of agriculture, industry, or commerce can a high school graduate be expected to do some practical work? I dare to say boldly that among them, those who can write an ordinary note that is considered clear, smooth, and flawless are as rare as morning stars; not to mention junior high school graduates. Other things like geometry, algebra, biology, physics, and chemistry have no place to be used at all. Perhaps the education authorities have two reasons for compiling such curriculum standards: (1) These many subjects are common knowledge that a high school student, a person who has received education, should know; (2) As preparation for further education, because everyone has different interests, some specialize in engineering, some specialize in medicine, some in politics, and some in agriculture, so it is necessary to lay a foundation in each subject. Regarding the first layer, we don't need to talk about theory; we just need to try to find a lawyer and ask him to solve a very common geometry or algebra problem, and see if he can handle it. Or ask a doctor which cities the Pinghan Railway passes through, and see if he can answer in detail without error. If they cannot solve it or handle it, we have good reason to say that they have no common knowledge. But in reality, how many people possess all such common knowledge? When they were in school, they generally put in a lot of hard work, generally went through dozens of exams, and some even received awards, but because their brains cannot store so much material, new goods come in and the stored goods are cleared out. The hard work they put in at the beginning is all in vain, and most of the time is wasted. To be honest, this so-called common knowledge, when a student steps into the door of a specialized school, except for things related to her field of study, everything else is forgotten completely. Why wait until he becomes a lawyer or a doctor? The original intention of compiling curriculum standards was to hope that everyone could solve common problems, but the result is that they can't even figure out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They hoped that everyone would know that there is Tiger Hill in Suzhou, but the result is that they even forget the Himalayas. Instead of going into shallow things with deep books and trying to be detailed but being superficial, why not put more effort into the important and essential aspects?</p>
<p>Based on what was said above, the second reason—"preparing for further education"—is self-defeating. Since students have different interests and specialize in different subjects, the so-called "artistic cultivation" and "preparation" should also be given different priorities. Why must a student who is preparing to become a doctor be forced to put in effort in literature and history along with everyone else, and a person who wants to become a lawyer be forced to put in effort in biology and geography? The unreasonableness of the curriculum standards is to cater to this illogical entrance examination. The need to thoroughly revise the curriculum standards is clear evidence that the entrance examination urgently needs to be reformed. Moreover, those who go on to further education are a minority, so what about the majority who don't go on to further education?</p>
<p>What the world, especially China, urgently needs now is undoubtedly specialized talent. This is an ironclad fact. Therefore, the responsibility of the education authorities is to quickly create this kind of specialized talent—specialized talent with roots, solid foundations, and rich experience, not superficial and nominal specialized talent, and certainly not jacks-of-all-trades who know a little bit about everything but are not proficient in anything. So why should we sacrifice 80% of young people's time during their studies on impractical "miscellaneous" subjects? If we don't change course and catch up quickly, China will forever suffer from a talent shortage, and even if education is universal, at most there will be 450 million jacks-of-all-trades!</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned drawbacks, the current education system also has a major flaw: students only know how to play hide-and-seek in the prescribed textbooks, and in the large fields of society and the world, it can be said that their eyes are blind, their ears are deaf, and their mouths are mute. In particular, their hands are virtually useless. A frail body cannot withstand the blow of the west wind and falling leaves. Even if everyone in China is such a university student, what good will it do for society and the country? The Four Books and Five Classics and the Eight-legged Essay of the imperial examination era misled the youth of the country and gradually sent the country to its doom. This kind of education that fools the people and harms the country will always be hated and cursed by the Chinese people. It is unexpected that today, thirty or forty years after the abolition of the imperial examination, the so-called education is still the policy of fooling the people in the feudal era, stuffing these many impractical books into the minds of young people in a cramming style, plus one exam after another. This heavy pressure makes schools and students lifeless, without even a chance to breathe. This kind of education is "suicide education." If it is not thoroughly reformed as soon as possible, China will never have hope of progress!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the current education system puts students completely in a passive position. They are only allowed to accept, not to initiate. They have to eat what they like, and they have to swallow what they don't like. The specialized schools are surrounded by copper walls and iron walls, becoming a forbidden area for a very few people. A golden hoop is added to each student's head, and they can't step beyond the prescribed boundaries. I really don't understand what those majestic and prominent so-called education experts interpret the word "education" as. Do they think that just singing high praises and playing with official documents is enough? Or do they really not know what education is and what kind of people China needs? If it belongs to the former, then I don't need to say more. The turbulent democratic torrent will sooner or later wash away these dregs of the times. If it belongs to the latter, I still have a glimmer of hope. I hope they give up the bad habit of "sticking to old ways," try to save this ruined situation, save the country, and save the youth!</p>
<p>I have no backing, so I don't qualify as an expert; if I'm not an expert, I don't have the right to "formulate a plan for reference." However, based on decades of experience in school education and witnessing the near bankruptcy of school education, although I left the education field a year ago due to the pressure of life, I am unwilling to remain silent. I will roughly provide a few opinions to arouse the attention of social elites and education pioneers, and then urge the government to "order" improvement. In that case, throwing a brick to attract jade, for the future of education, that is, the future of China, may be of great benefit.</p>
<p>The current so-called education is always: in the morning, they take their books to school, enter the classroom, and sit there quietly listening to the teacher's explanation. The explanation always escapes the scope of the textbook. This is the same for one, two or three lessons, and then they eat lunch. After lunch, it is still these same three lessons. Then everyone disperses, and the school thinks it has fulfilled its responsibility, and the students and teachers think they have completed a day's work. It's the same every day, every month, and every year, until graduation. If this is considered education, then it is an understatement to view education as such a simple thing. Doesn't everyone know that moral, intellectual, physical and communal education are equally important? However, what "education" is there besides cultivating "bookworms" in this kind of school education? I think: First, future school education should reduce classroom hours and increase extracurricular work. In the classroom, the teacher is only in a guiding position, and the textbook is only a guide. A teacher should aim to arouse students' interest in research, so that students can express all their words and ideals in fact. There are many people in China who talk big, make arguments, and preach great truths, but there are countless who are short-sighted and don't know what society, the country, and the world are. Those who can truly lead the masses, seek truth from facts, and do things in a down-to-earth manner are truly rare. To correct this problem, we must first overthrow the previous cramming education and focus on enhancing students' initiative, cultivating their cooperation habits, and fostering a spirit of service. In terms of curriculum, we should encourage them to read freely, express themselves freely, and write freely. In particular, we must pay attention to experimental work, and make full use of the environment and existing equipment as experimental tools. The most ridiculous thing is that many schools even treat courses such as chemistry and physics as "literature" courses, explaining according to the text and translating according to the formula, without any experimental work at all. It can be said that this is a great absurdity! In terms of self-cultivation, we should always correct their extravagant, frivolous, fraudulent, and lazy habits, allow them to hold meetings freely, form associations freely, organize various competitions, and reward service work. School supplies should be made by the students themselves as much as possible, and cleaning work should be done by the students themselves. In addition, things like gardening, music, art, and volunteer schools should all be included in the normal curriculum, with teachers responsible for guidance, assessing grades at any time, and adapting to individual talents. In addition to teaching and grading papers, teachers should especially go deep into the student population, interact with them more, pay attention to their words and deeds, personality, and strengths at any time, and provide guidance, commendation, and encouragement. Speaking of this, "teacher qualifications" become a big problem. Excellent teachers are not necessarily university graduates, returned students, or masters and doctoral students. The most important thing is in terms of integrity. They must have a clear conscience, be free of current bad habits, and be able to lead by example to be qualified to be teachers. There are many teachers now who use the school as a base for political activities, or as a temporary ferry boat for shelter, or as a nursing home that does not seek advancement, or even think about turning students into cash cows, or make friends with students for pleasure. No matter how outstanding their learning is, they are not worthy of being "teachers." Of course, to demand excellent teachers, the first thing is to improve teacher salaries. This is just talking about the matter.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of curriculum compilation, we should pay attention to practicality. On the one hand, we must consider that graduates of all levels of schools can do some practical work in society. On the other hand, those who have the strength to pursue further education can go to school. Students' health must be especially taken care of. Elementary school students are not fully developed, so they should do more activities and read less. Therefore, the elementary school curriculum should be reduced as much as possible. I think the courses to be taken should only be four: Chinese, mathematics, common knowledge, and labor. The average time in the classroom each day should not be more than four hours (the senior grades may be slightly increased appropriately). English is not necessary at all, because the English that elementary school students learn in a year can probably be learned well by middle school students in a month. Moreover, if these English students do not go on to further education after graduating from elementary school, they are of no practical use at all. The goal of Chinese is only to be able to understand the newspaper and express one's own meaning in writing. The time it occupies should be at least two-thirds of the entire curriculum. Mathematics only needs to learn the "four arithmetic operations" well and skillfully. More than 80% of the time should be spent on numbers, reducing application problems as much as possible. Relatively difficult problems that require thinking should be absolutely rejected. Common knowledge includes history, geography, physics, and chemistry, and only needs some very common outlines. The simpler the better, and most of it can be included in Chinese. For example, geography only needs to know how many oceans, continents, major countries, provinces, cities, main railways, mountains, and rivers there are in the world, and their locations, the main products of the country, and what the earth, the sun, and the moon are. These items are already sufficient, but they must be repeatedly repeated to keep them firmly in mind. The answers should be as familiar as answering one's own name.</p>
<p>The junior high school curriculum is still mainly Chinese and mathematics, with English and common knowledge as supplements. The goal of Chinese is to improve thinking, enrich information, and be able to express opinions and handle ordinary documents in practical terms. Mathematics should pay attention to practical arithmetic, such as profit and loss, interest, measurement, etc. The numbers can be cumbersome, and the questions must be straightforward. The purpose is to seek rapid, accurate, smooth, and fluent calculation. Other things such as algebra and geometry should be superficial, refined, and skilled, and avoid being profound. Science and history are still included in the scope of common knowledge, but we should mention the most prominent, and compared with the elementary school curriculum, we may slightly increase one or two, but still focus on refinement and skill. In addition to training accurate pronunciation, English should teach basic grammar, especially the use of dictionaries, cultivate self-study skills, and focus on the construction of simple sentences, eliminating bad habits such as memorizing rules and definitions.</p>
<p>High school must be divided into subjects. In addition to Chinese and foreign languages, which are prescribed as common compulsory subjects</p>
<p>(This must be advanced, and non-liberal arts students do not need to study old literature), the rest are assigned according to categories. It can be roughly divided into six departments: engineering, mathematics and physics, commerce, law and politics, medicine, and literature. The first year focuses on basic subjects, and the second and third years focus on specialized subjects. Except for literature, law and politics, and mathematics and physics, we should reduce theory as much as possible and focus on practicality. For example, for a formula, we don't need to study its source in detail, but just be able to use it freely. In addition, each student should take an elective course such as shorthand, typing, drawing, calligraphy, or music. Each senior high school must have at least two departments, and its equipment and student allocation must have clear regulations.</p>
<p>In this way, in terms of students' prospects, if an elementary school graduate comes out to be an apprentice in a company, firm, or factory, he at least understands reading and calculation. A junior high school graduate can be self-sufficient by doing some copying, dispatching, accounting, proofreading, and ordinary letters. High school graduates are even more specialized in their studies. As long as the politics is on the right track, they don't have to worry about finding a way out. It's probably not too different from the current university graduates. As long as they undergo short-term practical training, even if they can't be engineers, they can handle being a supervisor or technician. Even if they can't be judges or doctors, they are qualified to be clerks or nurses. As for high school graduates who want to continue their studies, the subjects of the university entrance examination should of course also be classified and linked to the courses taken in high school, and separate standards should be formulated. Since high school is divided into subjects, the level of university specialized courses can also be greatly improved, and the weight of practical work can be increased.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned method, it may seem too easy for a few students with outstanding talents. If this statement is true (in fact, it is not true, because learning will not be too refined, and there are more things to learn outside of reading), the school authorities can assess the situation and allow special promotion, on the one hand to save their time, and on the other hand it is an excellent reward method. Speaking of this, we should think of the strict restrictions of the current curriculum—no junior high school graduation certificate cannot apply for high school, no high school diploma cannot apply for university, and cannot transfer schools without the certification of the school authorities. These and many other unreasonable restrictions do not know how many young people lose their studies, how many parents cry out, and how many geniuses are buried! The education authorities have set these rules. It is not known on what grounds these were established. It is truly unfathomable. If the country really wants to popularize education and create talents, this absurd and outrageous restriction must be eliminated; otherwise, it is no different from using the education suicide system to harm talents!</p>
<p>Students now have one more extremely painful thing to do, and that is to cope with exams. Taking a high school graduate as an example, before and after his graduation, there is a big exam, and some schools have to have another graduation exam, followed by a joint exam. When applying for universities, in order to leave a way out, they have to apply to at least two places. In this way, in just one short month, he has to cope with five exams, burying his head in a tense atmosphere every day, and the time is just in the summer, the sun is scorching, and the weather is hot and stuffy. This system is really close to cruel. Unless the government admits that school education is not on track, it should admit that these exams are contradictory. Since the school is approved by the government, then the graduates of this school are of course qualified, but the government refuses to admit it and must have a joint exam. If the graduation exam passes and the joint exam passes, it is clear that they are qualified to enter the university, but the university refuses to admit it and still has to go through an exam. To say it straight, this is clearly the government not trusting itself, and as a result, students suffer in vain. Otherwise, why not combine the three exams into one? But then again, many middle school students have made many jokes in the joint examination before, such as "Li Bai was a person of the Ming Dynasty" and "The capital of Zhejiang is Wu County", etc. These are all the brilliant achievements of the joint examination. Of course, students like this are not allowed to graduate. Perhaps because of this, some people say that the joint examination cannot be abolished, but since there is a joint examination, then the school exam is superfluous. At the same time, the school allows students who are far below the standard to graduate and participate in the joint examination, which is clearly poor school management and misleading children. It should be strictly prohibited and must not be ambiguous. In the final analysis, the curriculum standard is unreasonable, and the government cannot shirk its responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to arouse the sympathy of the Chinese people is that students do not pay enough attention to physical education. The average physique of Chinese people is below that of foreigners, and the difference is very large. Of course, food and nutrition are a major reason, but the lack of exercise is indeed an undeniable major factor. On the one hand, the curriculum is too heavy, and on the other hand, the environment is bad, so that most students are either weak white-faced scholars or lazy worms with depressed wills. Therefore, we should urgently reduce the curriculum, and the school should formulate measures to force students to exercise more, so that they become interested in exercise. This will not only help the soundness of the physique, but also prevent them from indulging in improper entertainment.</p>
<p>The above is just to serve as an issue for improving school education. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity that the Ministry of Education is working on revising the curriculum standards for secondary schools, I have brought it up to discuss with gentlemen across the country who care about education. As for the detailed implementation plan and many other problems that urgently need to be improved, they all need to be considered and decided by the education authorities and education "experts".</p>

<h3>Basketball League: Hua Yang Suffers First Defeat to Chen You, Railway Jing Defeated by Encas, Qiang Hua Women's Team Wins Against Women's Youth Hong</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In the second Basketball League, two matches were held last night. In the women's division, Qiang Hua defeated Women's Youth Hong by a large margin of 63 to 23. In the second division of Group A, Hua Yang suffered its first defeat to Chen You, 45 to 36. In the final match, Encas defeated Railway Jing by a large margin, 47 to 19. The details of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Women's Division</p>
<p>In the first match of the women's division, Qiang Hua played against Women's Youth Hong. The Cao family team showed their strength, with Manli, Manti, and Huang Jun dominating the game. Huang Jun scored the first point, and the score quickly rose. Women's Youth Hong only managed to score one goal by Wu Minjue. In the first quarter, Qiang Hua took a commanding lead of 21 to 2. In the second quarter, Women's Youth Hong still did not improve. When Zeng Zhaoqing joined the game, their momentum slightly increased, but at halftime, the score was 33 to 7. After switching sides, Wu Minjue and Wu Hanlian of Women's Youth Hong made some contributions, but the Cao family team was still very dominant. In the third quarter, the score was 52 to 12. In the final quarter, Women's Youth Hong strengthened their defense, and both teams scored 11 points. In the end, Qiang Hua won by a large margin of 63 to 23.</p>
<p>Group A Second Division</p>
<p>In the second match, Hua Yang faced Chen You. Both teams were perennial winners in the second division of Group A, so the game was very intense. Shi Jiuquan of Chen You scored the first basket, and Ji Youkun of Hua Yang responded. From then on, the score went back and forth, with only one point separating the teams, 7 to 6, 8 to 7. The situation was very tense. Eventually, because the "fatty" (referring to a player) was slower in his movements, they gradually fell behind. At halftime, Chen You led 17 to 11. After switching sides, Hua Yang fell further behind. Ji Youkun was also called for his fifth foul and was removed from the game, further demoralizing the team. Huang Cunrui and Wang Bingfu of Chen You made near-shots and long-shots, making the score 41 to 26, securing their victory. The "fatty" had plenty of stamina left, but time was not on his side. In the end, Chen You won 45 to 36, and Hua Yang suffered their first defeat.</p>
<p>Group A First Division</p>
<p>In the final match, Encas played against Railway Jing. Jiang Guoping of Railway Jing scored the first point with a free throw, but Krosky of Encas responded with two points, gaining strong momentum and quickly taking the lead 9 to 1. Railway Jing switched to a slow-passing strategy, but the opposing team was tall and strong, leaving Railway Jing helpless. At halftime, Encas led by a wide margin of 22 to 7. After switching sides, the game was still dominated by the foreign players. Yang Xianji of Railway Jing managed to score a few points, but that was all. In the end, Encas won by a large margin of 47 to 19. Railway Jing suffered a crushing defeat.</p>

<h3>Lixin Institute of Accounting Flourishes Amidst the Hardships of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Lixin Institute of Accounting was built upon the foundation of Lixin Accounting Firm, founded by accountant Pan Xulun. It is divided into two parts. The preparatory school was established in the spring of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928] and has a history of twenty years. However, the preparatory school was not suitable for training high-level talents, so there was a proposal to establish a vocational school in the 26th year [i.e., 1937].</p>
<p>At that time, Chen Qicai and Wang Yunwu served as chairman and vice-chairman of the board, respectively, and Pan Xulun served as the president. Qian Xinzhi, Jiang Hengyuan, Song Hanzhang, Liu Gongyun, Wu Yunchu, Wu [missing character] Mei, Du Yuesheng, Rong Hongyuan, Zhang Jianwen, Zha Jimin, Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, Qian Naicheng, Chen Wenlin, Li Hongshou, and Wang Fengxin successively joined the board of directors. The copyright of Lixin's accounting books, donated by Lixin Accounting Firm, was valued at 100,000 yuan. The school also possessed 4,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books, a startup fund of 5,000 yuan, and 60,000 yuan from Pan's years of professional earnings, totaling over 170,000 yuan, which served as the foundation for establishing Lixin Institute of Accounting. However, the August 13th Incident [beginning of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937] brought about an initial setback. By the 28th year [i.e., 1939], the situation in Shanghai gradually recovered, and approval was obtained from the Ministry of Education to formally open the school. By the 30th year [i.e., 1941], the first graduation ceremony was held, but the school encountered another setback due to the fall of the foreign concessions. In the 31st year [i.e., 1942], the school moved inland to Beibei, Sichuan. After three or four years of hard work, ten school buildings were established, and the scale was roughly formed. After the victory [of the war], the staff returned to Shanghai. Due to a severe housing shortage, Pan first used his own three-story, five-bay Western-style house at 466 Pulishi Road as a temporary school building and planned to build a new campus on the original site in Xujiahui. The preliminary plan has now been realized, with four buildings of various sizes being constructed.</p>
<p>The Textile Building and Zongjing Hall are a three-story reinforced concrete structure, named in commemoration of the large donations from the textile industry. It includes a large auditorium that can accommodate 1,000 people and fourteen classrooms of various sizes that can accommodate 70-80 to 140-150 people. Siyuan Hall commemorates the enthusiastic donations of Lixin's students and alumni, with the implication of "when you drink water, remember the source." The entire campus covers more than 40 mu, and various constructions are underway. It is envisioned that this young sprout, which has grown amidst the hardships of the war, will develop and flourish without limit.</p>

<h3>Three Hundred Miles of the Lu-Xi Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Zong Chunlin, Special Correspondent from Xuzhou</p>
<p>Three Days of Aerial Reporting from Xuzhou</p>
<p>Three Days of Aerial Reporting from Xuzhou, Zong Chunlin, Our Correspondent in Xuzhou</p>
<p>It was the time of heavy snow. Yutai, an ancient city on the shores of Weishan Lake, stood tall in the biting north wind. Snow swirled, and ice locked everything down.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Yutai once fell into the hands of the Communist army. Because the local people could not bear the oppression of the "road-ripping army," they launched a revolt throughout Yutai. At that time, there were more than 20,000 armed righteous people, who finally recovered Yutai. Before this, the county seat was very solid and strong, but it had all been torn down by the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Yutai: An Ancient City on the Shores of Weishan Lake</h3>
<p>The current city is an earthen stockade, formed by connecting countless small bunkers into a large bunker. Thousands upon thousands of firing holes are densely distributed on the walls around the city like stars.</p>
<p>North of Fengxian, we already smelled the air of the "Liberated Zone" and experienced the "benevolent rule" of the "Liberated Zone." The villages were desolate, like a pool of stagnant water. Walls had collapsed, houses had been demolished, and doors, windows, and trees had all been swept away. Even the dogs in the villages had been killed by the Communist army, because dogs were considered obstacles to night marches.</p>
<p>Yutai has an east-west street, which is not very long. There are more than 200 shops, but they are all in their twilight years. It is as poor as a group of aging patients, and none of them can open their doors, because even their remaining food, tattered cotton wadding, and broken basins and bowls... have long been "liberated" by the "road-ripping army."</p>
<p>This small city on the shores of Weishan Lake was once a paradise in the north, because the silted land on the lake was particularly fertile, and farmers could reap without laboring. It used to be a place of wheat barns, fish markets, peanuts, bean oil, cotton, and lake rice. Every year in the late spring, when the spring breeze thawed the ice, fishermen transported goods by small boats. Sometimes, when the sun was just rising, the young men walking on the ancient roads would hum a few lines of the love songs they were accustomed to singing. But now everything has changed, and everything has been "ripped" away and "liberated" by the "road-ripping army."</p>
<h3>Fang Xian: A Man of Great Valor</h3>
<p>Calm, resolute, and brave, General Fang is a typical young military officer.</p>
<p>As if everyone still has fresh memories of what happened three years ago, one can recall that the Japanese mobilized the Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China, using overwhelming force to attack Hunan. However, they ran into a major obstacle in the city of Hengyang. At that time, our General Fang stubbornly defended the city for forty-seven days, a historical event that shocked both China and the world, and still lives vividly in the hearts of every patriot.</p>
<p>General Fang is very tall, and his face has a deep expression, which matches his resolute character.</p>
<p>He is from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. This loyal and patriotic general was born in Xuzhou, "the ancient battlefield in front of Mount Jiuli" (Bai Juyi's poem). He is currently the commander of the Xuzhou Garrison Command and the commander of the 88th Division, and is only in his thirties. He graduated from the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy and was a classmate of General Wang Yaowu, who is currently stationed in Jinan, and they are very close friends.</p>
<p>In the small house of his headquarters, there is a scroll of poem given by a poet: "A husband values vitality, not seeking it for himself alone, how can one obtain ten thousand li of fur, to cover all four borders within, may the masses all know me warm, and there be no cold people in the world."</p>
<p>He is a devout Christian, and the "Bible" is always with him.</p>
<h3>Jinxiang: Immovable as a Mountain</h3>
<p>The area around Jinxiang and the founding area north of Yutai are the regions where the brothers of the 88th Division are fighting hard to defend the country and protect the greater Xuzhou area.</p>
<p>The Communist army copied the old trick of "encircling" and "attacking the fertile soil," attempting to launch attacks on the periphery of Xuzhou. Liu Bocheng and Yang Yong led three columns and a group of bandits, according to estimates from prisoners and intelligence, totaling about 30,000, along with two puppet commissioners' offices and nine puppet county governments, plus local bandits, totaling more than 150,000.</p>
<p>For a whole month, the city of Jinxiang remained as impregnable as a golden soup. Li Wenmi, the brigade commander of the entire 88th Division, fought hard, and the people of Jinxiang all participated in the battle. The Communist army forcibly collected countless old people from Juye, Shuming, Dongping, Dong'e, Ningyang, and Sishui, and taught them to carry bundles of sorghum stalks to fill the trenches, taught them to tie large knives to their hands and climb the city walls, and taught them to carry a large hammer to bomb the national army's bunkers.</p>
<h3>A Week of Chaos</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The market last week was extremely chaotic, and general production enterprises felt lost. In this situation, budgets cannot be established, and production cannot be planned, which is not a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Originally, China's production enterprises were already struggling due to the low-price dumping of foreign manufactured goods. After the victory, imports of production goods were very few, and imports of consumer goods were more numerous, which increased costs and made it difficult for exports to compete with foreign goods. If the current chaotic situation does not stop soon, the future will be difficult, and the situation will become even more serious!</p>
<p>The mentality of speculation and self-interest should be eliminated immediately, but the biggest prerequisite is the government's early clarification.</p>
<h3>Saving the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Ren Chongliang</p>
<p>Last year, all industries and businesses were in a slump, especially the silk industry, which suffered from many problems and huge losses. The entire silk industry is trending towards total collapse. Although the government recognized the importance of the silk industry in exports and implemented silk purchases, the scope of purchases was limited to raw silk reeled from loans, and the standards for purchase prices were very strict, so manufacturers still felt that it was not enough to cover costs. Last autumn, due to weather conditions, the autumn cocoon harvest was poor, and raw materials were scarce, so that most factories had already closed by the end of last year. Of the dozens of silk factories in Wuxi, only "Yongtai," "Jiatai," and "Meixin" have opened this year, but the stock of dried cocoons in Wuxi, according to experts in the industry, is not enough to support the factories with 300 machines until the new cocoons are available. Therefore, most of the silk factories this year will be forced to shut down until May of the lunar calendar. However, after receiving the new cocoons, the prospect is still not optimistic. The competition from Japanese silk is a fatal blow; the invention of "nylon" and "rayon" is the fundamental reason affecting the future prosperity of the silk industry. The causes and consequences are complex and intertwined. Here, I would like to briefly describe the importance of the silk industry to rural areas and the ways to save it, as far as my humble opinion can reach.</p>
<h3>The Golden Age: Domestic Silk Competes with Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>Since the emergence of the silk industry in our country, farmers have used their spare time from farming to grow mulberry trees and raise silkworms. The climate and land conditions are all suitable. The farmers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely on this as their main side business. However, because Chinese people adhered to old methods and did not seek improvement, the quality of their products was poor, and the overseas market was seized by Japan. Before the war, a few insightful people shouted loudly and strived for improvement, so that in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic [i.e., 1936 and 1937], their products could be compared with Japanese silk. Unfortunately, the War of Resistance broke out, and the remaining foundation was almost destroyed by the Japanese invaders. The near success was a pity. Since the victory, due to the devaluation of foreign exchange and prices, high wages, and sluggish foreign sales, the silk industry has been in a slump, creating today's terrible depression.</p>
<p>The silk industry can earn foreign exchange and prosper rural areas, and is closely related to the national economic lifeline. It cannot be allowed to take its own course. There are several ways to save it:</p>
<p>(1) Improving Sericulture: 300 catties of Japanese dried cocoons can be used to reel one dan [a unit of weight] of raw silk. According to the raw materials received last year, 600 catties are needed to reel one dan of raw silk in our country. According to the current cost of reeling silk, raw materials account for about five-tenths of the total cost. Therefore, with the same machinery and labor, and selling at the same price, Japanese merchants can make a profit, while we still have to lose money. Therefore, poor raw materials are a major reason for the losses of our silkworm farmers and silk factories. Before the war, Yongtai Silk Factory and others recognized this and first implemented "cooperative rearing and forced hatching," established silkworm rearing cooperatives, and trained technical personnel to guide villagers in silkworm rearing. As a result, the results were excellent, the farmers' output increased, the manufacturers' reeling was easier, the reeling costs were reduced, and the quality was improved. Both manufacturers and rearing households benefited. Therefore, it is appropriate to first restore the silkworm rearing cooperatives, in order to improve the quality of cocoons and reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Future Improvements: Competing with Japan</h3>
<p>(2) Remodeling Japanese Latest Silk Reeling Machines: Most of the silk reeling machines in our country are old-fashioned sitting reeling machines. There are only a few with "multi-spindle" standing reeling machines. Most manufacturers have short capital and cling to short-term benefits, so they do not seek improvement. Comparing the performance of standing reeling machines with sitting reeling machines, the results are about 70% higher with standing reeling machines. However, compared with the most advanced Japanese machinery, the difference in output is almost doubled. Therefore, the urgent task is to send silk industry experts to Japan as soon as possible to learn the manufacture and reeling of these machines, and then advocate it for the people of the country, so that it can be successful.</p>
<p>(3) Training of Workers: Last year, the Hefeng Silk Mill in this city invited Japanese technicians who had not yet withdrawn to visit the factory. According to the technicians, when working with this kind of standing reeling machine in Japan, (referring to Hefeng's standing multi-spindle machine), the results could be much higher, which shows that the training of workers has not been perfected. The service spirit of Japanese female workers is especially admirable, and they can consider the factory's costs when increasing wages. In contrast, Chinese workers want more wages, and they do not care about whether the factory can maintain its operations. The mentality of killing the chicken to get the eggs, if this concept is not eliminated one day, then the future of the silk industry will inevitably lead to its own extinction.</p>
<h3>Artificial Fibers: Research Should Also Begin</h3>
<p>(4) Research on Artificial Fibers: Since the invention of "nylon" rayon, it has only been eight years, but the progress has been rapid. According to an article on nylon manufacturing in this publication, DuPont in the United States produces 20 million pounds of rayon per year, which can make 450 million pairs of silk stockings, with amazing sales. Therefore, after nylon stockings entered the market in Shanghai, the sales of domestic silk stockings have decreased greatly! The slowness of nylon compared to natural silk is self-evident. Nylon is a product of science, and its progress is rapid. In contrast, because silk has natural conditions, its progress cannot keep pace with silk. Taking the improvement of sericulture as an example, 300 catties of dried cocoons to reel one dan of raw silk is already the most advanced method of breeding cocoons. If we work hard to study it, it may be possible to reel one dan of raw silk with 200 catties of cocoons. But if you want to reel one dan of raw silk with 100 catties of dried cocoons, this is absolutely impossible. Therefore, research on the manufacture of rayon is also a matter of urgency. This is something that cannot be resisted. If you cling to sericulture and reeling and do not seek research on artificial fibers, it is like hitting a stone with an egg, and you will inevitably be crushed and fall behind.</p>
<p>In short, the way to save the silk industry at present is to strive for improvement in raw materials, machinery, and labor. The existing silk industry in Japan should be used as a reference. And research on artificial fibers should also be expedited, because this is the only way to conform to the scientific principle of "outdoing nature."</p>
<h3>The Employer's Psychology</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>The success of a business depends largely on the efforts of its employees. In order to get employees to work hard, employers must understand how to use people. Unfortunately, most employers are ignorant of this, so that the businesses they run cannot achieve success. Here are two of the more common mistakes that employers tend to make, for reference. I hope employers will pay attention to them, as it will greatly help the development of their businesses.</p>
<p>Some employers praise hardworking employees in secret or in their hearts, but they are always reluctant to praise them in person. The psychology of an employer who is stingy with praise is that they are afraid that after praising the employees, they will think of higher salaries.</p>
<p>The employer's praise is a great encouragement to the employees, and they will become more diligent and work efficiency will increase greatly. Even if they receive a little more salary, they deserve it.</p>
<p>An employee with special merits is of great benefit to the employer. The employer makes money because of this, and in this case, the credit should be given to that employee. However, some employers are jealous of employees with merits, and even use the logic of "only I have the store, and only the store has you" to deduce the conclusion that "your merits are actually a manifestation of my merits."</p>
<p>Such employers are too short-sighted. The employees will regret, why not be lazy? And it will often anger him to seek development elsewhere, and choose a better tree to perch on, which is a great loss for the original employer.</p>
<h3>A Standing Silk Reeling Machine</h3>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>2. Cooperative Spirit</p>
<p>To make employees increase their service period, the first key point is that there must be a cooperative spirit between the employer and the employees. Under normal circumstances, the employer and the employees are in a position of opposition. The employer thinks that the employees are mechanical and cannot understand their true value. On the employees' side, they think that the employers are all profit-seeking and use the employees as a tool to make money. If both sides have this kind of mentality, then there is no way to talk about cooperation. So to talk about cooperation, then the first thing is to remove this mentality. On the employer's side, whatever can be done, whenever possible, should be done immediately, so that the employees can be sincerely convinced. The expression of this spirit should be paid more attention to and implemented by the employer, and it is best to have this spirit expressed from time to time.</p>
<p>This of course also depends on the situation of the enterprise organization or factory. If the situation is good, then it is easy to implement. If the enterprise itself is in a bad situation, such as encountering a market downturn, or the industry cannot be developed, or is affected by the situation and cannot carry out business for a while, then the employer will have the pain of being unable to do what he wants. But even in this situation, he should openly and honestly explain to the employees, so that they can understand and sympathize. In the movie "The Great Man Edison", Edison owed debts to others because his invention was not successful, and could only hide under the table. He also did not have the power to distribute salaries, so he had to dismiss all his employees. But those employees were able to understand his difficulties and were willing to work for him without taking salaries. This kind of cooperative spirit is very touching. But everything depends on human effort, especially in handling personnel affairs. As long as there is that kind of motivation, it can be implemented.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn (a literary section)</p>
<h3>文以人傳</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>It is indeed common for people to be known through their writings. It goes without saying that some people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds are remembered for generations because they also established their words. But even impoverished scholars, humble commoners, and even villagers, who have neither earth-shattering achievements to shake the times nor towering virtues to lead the masses, are valued and immortalized simply because they have writings, whether voluminous or containing poignant words. Therefore, in our country that reveres antiquity and values literature, for thousands of years, everyone has valued literature. Besides using it to obtain fame and fortune, some write books and establish theories, while others compose poetry, all hoping to make themselves last for a long time through it. They only focus on their writing, and they truly want to be remembered through their writing. Some, whose writing is not particularly good, are even proud to have a few lines quoted in the collections of great writers and poets, leaving behind their names. To be remembered through one's writing has become a widespread and deeply ingrained belief.</p>
<p>But strangely, when we look at the works that have been passed down to the present, are they really that numerous? How many of these writers who hoped to leave a lasting legacy do we actually know? Although the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections) can be said to be vast, shouldn't there be more after thousands of years of transmission? Of course, the chaos of past dynasties has caused the loss of books, which is a major reason. However, why have many books not been lost? The burning of books by Qin Shi Huang ultimately could not overcome Fu Sheng's memory, nor could it eliminate the common people who presented books to the imperial court during the Han Dynasty. This is an ironclad fact! How many of the poets praised in works like "Sui Guo Shihua" (Poetry Talks of the Sui Kingdom) are truly household names? Those who read these "poetry talks" only regard these poets as fleeting clouds. Therefore, I cannot help but say that it is not people who are remembered through their writing, but writing that is remembered through people!</p>
<p>Yes, writing is remembered through people. It is because they are people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds that their words can also stand the test of time. Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei) was not a literary figure, so why is his "Man Jiang Hong" (All Red River) poem sung even by children? Conversely, those who lacked virtue and accomplished nothing, and even harmed the country and the people, even if their writing was ingenious, like Qin Hui and Yan Gao, how many learned people have seen their writings? Furthermore, we might as well briefly examine a Chinese literary history. Are there any extremely bad villains among the famous writers? I think not. Cao Cao was indeed a "cunning hero in a chaotic world," but he was also a "capable minister in a peaceful world." He can be considered one of the famous writers. Wang Anshi has been completely vindicated today. He was definitely not the person described in "Bian Jian Lun" (On Distinguishing Traitors). He is also undoubtedly a famous writer, and indeed, he became one in his own lifetime. Therefore, it is impossible to say that all famous writers throughout history are people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds. There are certainly those who are romantic and unrestrained, those who are pedantic and stubborn, or those whose actions were not entirely satisfactory. However, as long as they do not "exceed the bounds of great virtue," then "small deviations are acceptable." The writings of such people may be passed down, but this cannot overturn the principle that writing is remembered through people. Because if someone is truly extremely bad, I believe that either their name will not be in literary history, or not a single one of their works will be passed down! If they have been passed down to this day, then they are certainly not the worst people. And if we were to investigate their life, it would probably be the case, and their transmission would be fair, if their writing is indeed good. This is still writing being remembered through people!</p>
<p>I say this not to make empty arguments, show off my knowledge, or pick up on the words of others and boast as if I have discovered a secret. These words are originally known to everyone. My intention is simply to remind today's writers not to put all their effort into writing while forgetting about being a good person! "Living in this world," being a good person is the most important thing! A person who cannot write is still a person in the end; but what will writing amount to if it doesn't make a person?</p>
<p>I am not telling today's writers that they must be good people in order for their writing to be passed down, as if being a good person is for the sake of their writing being passed down. Such actions of seeking fame and reputation will never give their writing value. I am simply saying that if good people have writing, their writing will surely be passed down. There is no need to worry about it, let alone putting the transmission of writing before being a good person. Even if the writing is not passed down, what does it matter! The person is still successful!</p>
<p>What is even worse is: those who have put the way of being a good person behind them, and do not even bother with the effort of writing, yet all day long they only think about using writing to show off, seek fame and fortune, and even want to dominate the literary world and leave a lasting legacy. I am truly worried for them: they will ultimately not be remembered; even if they are, it will probably be "infamous for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p>So, what kind of people should we be? And how should we act? This, I think you also know, so there is no need for me to say more, isn't that right?</p>
<p>Writer's Anecdotes</p>
<h3>大仲馬</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>Alexandre Dumas (1803-1870) was a wealthy French writer. He was also charitable and often distributed his wealth to the poor. He was also a prolific writer; in one year, he published forty novels. However, it is said that many of his works were plagiarized and ghostwritten. He ran a "Fiction Factory," which employed over two hundred workers. He himself was the foreman who directed and supervised the work.</p>
<h3>江南書簡</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>In my rural residence, I miss you, truly feeling "kind sir, you make me age." Yesterday, I received your letter from Chongqing, bringing back many memories. I still remember last winter when I lived in Hongyan Village in the suburbs of Chongqing. Every day I sat by the Jialing River watching the quiet water, my hometown appearing vividly in my mind, my homesickness lingering. Every day, I thought of my childhood Jiangnan, my lovely hometown. After spring came, I moved to Shenxian Cave in the city. One evening, I accidentally flipped through old books and suddenly came across a beautiful poem by Mr. Jiang Baishi, which said: "Vast is the misty Lake Ze, a fisherman's silhouette faint, Jade Peaks layered protect cloud garments, The Long Bridge is deserted on this cold spring night, Only a poet returns in a lone boat." At that time, the whole of Chongqing was filled with the sound of the Yangtze River flowing eastward, and only I was living alone by Shenxian Cave, reading this little poem, I was filled with mixed emotions, touching on countless feelings, wishing I could sprout wings and ride the wind home. But who would have thought that a year later, I would be alone again in the rural Jiangnan, every day missing the "When shall we trim the west window candle together, and talk about the night rain of Bashan" land of heavenly abundance? People are truly such busy creatures.</p>
<p>Now there is no need to hold a bundle of barren poems and weep to anyone. However, tonight, braving the cold wind and night dew, I stand blankly outside your door. Please open your door for me. I will bring ten years of flowers and love to the depths of your heart. Only after ten years do I understand that pain is the only noble thing for people. In order to weave the mysterious crown of my life, even if it were like the scattered treasures of ancient bronze cities, unknown pure gold, and the nocturnal light of the seabed, letting you pick them yourself would not be enough to weave the splendor of this crown.</p>
<p>These days my life has become stable, some thoughts, a small river of sighs...</p>
<p>In 1831, Goethe climbed the Ilmenau mountain peak again and saw the poem he had left here thirty-eight years ago, saying: "Soon, you too will rest..." The old man couldn't help but shed tears because, at this time, Goethe, as his young lover Charlotte said, could only look forward to the final reward - death, which is the final scene of turning the great nature into flames, riding on the "spiritual chariot" he praised and ascending to heaven. Goethe - the great father of eternal aesthetics, finally martyred to the gods he believed in - nature, life, and art - completely transformed into a bundle of flames. This sacrifice, this martyrdom, is so moving.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been dreaming more, thinking of the scenery of Beibei, the rural feelings of Bishan, my youthful years, and the autumn walks along the Jialing River.</p>
<p>I am always terribly lonely, a loneliness like losing consciousness. I need to talk, I need a kind heart to accommodate my love, I want to say a little hope to you from this gloomy morning, from this lonely hour. If we can get a little pitiful echo and response across the heavy mountains and rivers, sun, moon, and stars, by the charcoal fire, in the cold night wind and snow, your voice and laughter often linger by my side, I seem to see your shining eyes every day, and hear your beautiful Soprano singing. Do you still remember the Christmas night among the green trees, when we quietly walked hand in hand on the Songlinggang Road and our hearts beat? Do you still remember the glances and gentle smiles in the sunlight of the hot springs? These have all scattered like smoke.</p>
<p>Now my wealth is only this little bit of language. I love them, protect them, save them, and want them to become my loyal servants in my difficult days.</p>
<p>You said in your letter: Tolstoy is a kind of music, he makes criminals repent, makes evildoers turn to good, makes misers become generous... I admire your lovely lyricism. You also said that Tolstoy is like a solemn mountain, and you are working hard to climb to his peak. In my opinion, he is not only a mountain, but also a state of mind. It depends on how much sincerity and love you have to approach him, to climb him, to breathe the solemn atmosphere of the high sky of life. Every effort, every step, is a kind of completeness, a kind of occupation. The first and the last are the same pilgrims, with sincere hearts united, will linked with will. As Tolstoy himself said, the kingdom of God is not in heaven, but in the hearts of mankind.</p>
<p>Reading your passionate letter, I am very touched. As long as we can have sincere and public-spirited efforts, it is as if we are in the morning light and rosy clouds, our whole body is full of solemnity and hope.</p>
<h3>風箏</h3>
<p>— 翟放</p>
<p>Childhood stories, along with the memory of kites, are vaguely reappearing.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, every time the spring sun generously shone on the people of the earth, and the gentle wind brushed people's clothes, we would run to the sunny hillside to hold a grand "kite" competition. Seeing whose kite was high, whose was far, and whose was exquisite. Sometimes, if we weren't careful, the kite string would break! The kite with the broken string would slowly descend, and the sweat on our foreheads would drip continuously. We would eagerly chase after it, across the wooden bridge over the stream, over the small hill, across the vast field ridges, and hold an even greater race; everyone would search for that kite with the broken string. After finding it, we would tie the string back together and let it bathe in the spring sunlight again, washing away the dirt it had picked up after landing... We would then start singing songs again:</p>
<p>The kite floats!</p>
<p>The kite is high;</p>
<p>Whose is far,</p>
<p>Whose is high?</p>
<p>Rise up,</p>
<p>Rise even higher.</p>
<p>Today, I opened the window and looked up at the kites in the sky, soaring in the spring sunshine. The blue sky, the white kites, how beautiful, how poetic! However, I can only envy them alone by the window. Childhood stories have been replaced by a melancholy memory!</p>

<h3>記金松岑</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Songcen has died.</p>
<p>When the few words reporting his death on the newspaper leaped into my eyes, I doubted whether it was true! Because anyone who was familiar with him also thought it was best if it wasn't true. But, he ultimately died.</p>
<p>A pair of thick-rimmed glasses, so dignified and gentle, I will always remember. During the period when I worked with him, although this period was too short, he was the head of the Chinese Department of Guanghua University. We know that Guanghua was famous at the time for its "literature," and this promotion was entirely due to him. Therefore, Principal Zhang Shouyong insisted on him coming out. He was very enthusiastic. If a student he cared about hadn't been seen for a few days, he would be concerned: "Why haven't I seen him? I wonder how he's progressing?" At that time, I only held a concurrent position at Guanghua teaching "Chinese Literary Criticism" at "Daxia," running over twice a week, but I almost always went to his place. He and his grandson lived together in his room, also because his grandson was studying at the school, and he valued this third generation in his old age. It is said that he was like Kang Cheng to Xiao Tong of the same hometown, his talent being bent for this position. When the bandit atmosphere invaded this only concession, he took Xiao Tong to the countryside. Guanghua maintained its studies under a strategy of changing its name and dividing its territory to conceal itself, but he refused to set foot on this land again no matter what.</p>
<p>In the countryside, he indulged himself in poetry. Of course, the expression of words is easily pointed to as a crime, and ordinary poems about wind and moon are not what a concerned recluse would do. Therefore, he used allusions to the emperor to express the accumulated anger in his chest. In this way, he did not lose the allegorical nature of poetry. He once sent me many long poems, and I also allowed them to be published in the "Collection of Contemporary Poetry and Prose" that I edited, all of which satirized current events, such as "Startled Butterfly" and "Lion's Mane Fur." I am very ashamed that I dared not publish them all at that time. His original manuscripts were on Anhui Provincial Annals Hall paper, and I still treasure them in my chest to this day. The last poem was aimed at the enemy invaders, and I will record it here so that we can understand the loyalty and insight of this steadfast scholar. The title of the poem: Snail Swallows Elephant. (Self-note: This is a saying in Huang Shangu's poem)</p>
<p>"The elephant king is born of a strong tribe, Only the ivory is more beautiful than jade, The snail slowly covers its small freshness, Chewing by others, discarded in the ditch, The Bashe anciently had the ambition to eat elephants, In three years, the bones are exhausted, The conch shell also gathers turtle and crab groups, Its weak strength does not allow it to carry the continent, Wriggling and climbing to the axis, The old bear grins and lingers. A tender waist and a gentle mouth, Are the most treacherous places for cunning heroes, Passion and jealousy, both front and back are tormented, Peace and war are at a crossroads, with a hundred anxieties, The thatched pavilion faces the river, unloaded three times, Mud snails spin and prawns jump."</p>
<p>His poems are best in the ancient style. Similarly, his mastery of ancient prose surpasses that of Ouyang Xiu and Liu Zongyuan. He himself also said: "After Zhang Taiyan, I can't think of a second person." This is certainly not a self-important statement, but rather a matter of being hidden and silent. Now, Mr. has passed away, who can trace the flowing wind!</p>
<h3>踏雪尋梅</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>Speaking of plum blossoms, it gives us an abstract aesthetic of noble transcendence, jade purity, and ice purity. They are praised by poets, admired by celebrities and beauties, and depicted by painters and calligraphers. In the severe cold of the north wind, they condense fragrance and bloom, with sparse shadows and horizontal slants, uniquely marking a style. They symbolize a simple and authentic, great and lofty life.</p>
<p>People who live in Jiangnan only know that Xixi in Hangzhou, Dengwei in Suzhou, and the Wanqing Hall of the Plum Garden in Wuxi are concentrations of plum blossoms and fragrant snow seas. But remote places go unnoticed. Kunming, a paradise on earth with a mild climate in all seasons, I have seen Tang plum and Song cypress, jade trees and jade branches, and I was amazed. Last year, in the last month of winter, I happened to be in my hometown of Zhijiang County. I once went to find plum blossoms in the snow, to a secluded path in the western suburbs. Through a delicate and beautiful Taiping stone bridge, I looked up to the Taibai Tower of a generation of poetry masters, entered the Xiqian scenic area, and after several twists and turns, reached the Plum Blossom Ancient Na's tomb path. Although there was no grand scene of a plum forest and fragrant snow sea, there were also old trunks and iron branches, which can be regarded as century-old trees. Above them are the Changqing Pagoda and the Pi Yun Peak. I wrote a draft of the remaining snow at the foot of the mountain where the north wind howled and water dripped into ice, and I am glad that this trip was not in vain.</p>
<p>"Emerging from the mud without being stained, washing in the clear water without being seductive," this is Zhou Dunyi's comment on loving lotus flowers. "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," and "Although the chrysanthemums are gone, there are still frost-resistant branches," this is the style held by the pastoral poet Tao Yuanming Tao Qian. "The flowers are all withered and only they are fresh and beautiful, occupying the scenery in the small garden; Sparse shadows slanted horizontally in the clear and shallow water, and a faint fragrance floated in the yellow dusk of the moon," this explains why Lin Chushi loves plum blossoms. But what are the plum blossoms' own feelings? Allow me to write Tang poet Wang Qi's poem about plum blossoms below as the ending of this article.</p>
<p>"Not subject to a speck of dust, content with a bamboo fence and thatched hut;</p>
<p>Only because he mistakenly knew Lin Hejing, he angered the poets to talk about him to this day."</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血164</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>A drop in the bucket 164</p>
<p>- Ye Jinfeng</p>
<p>Just as "zero four" (04) had passed, Tsurumi seemed to remember something again, and immediately apologized to Yaoqun and us, "Excuse me," then went straight to the telephone and called out the number.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard the number, I knew he was calling the Japanese military headquarters' office secretly located in Beiping; in other words, it was the headquarters of the special services stationed in the city. Yaoqun and Little Tiger didn't understand Japanese, and stared blankly, their round eyes open wide.</p>
<p>"No matter what the situation is, just ask for Wu Dingyuan, a thin man in his thirties or forties with a Beiping accent, mostly in a suit, perhaps disguised, an engineer, formerly at Changxindian, and now somewhat mentally ill. No matter how serious the situation, I want this man, and he must not be harmed in the slightest!"</p>
<p>These were Tsurumi's words on the phone, sounding like a special command. What authority did Tsurumi, just a newly promoted colonel, have to command Matsui and Sakai? This is called "a monk from the capital is king when he's abroad." Moreover, given how much Konoe valued Tsurumi, it wouldn't take twenty-four hours for the brains of the military and intelligence agencies to figure it out, as long as they weren't complete fools. Although Tsurumi's rank wasn't particularly high, he was extremely popular both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Only after making this call did Tsurumi seem to feel more at ease. Yaoqun, Little Tiger, and I all breathed a sigh of relief. Especially Yaoqun. After I had roughly translated the meaning of Tsurumi's words on the phone, the color returned to her face, and her pair of clear eyes sparkled with an unusual joy:</p>
<p>"Mr. Gu, you're really a warm-hearted person, so protective of your friends."</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Wu is practically committing suicide by going there. I imagine he's going for revenge, to kill Japanese people. Do you think he can succeed? As for my own actions, Miss Yao, you'll slowly understand what kind of person I really am." For some reason, Tsurumi's cheeks flushed red.</p>
<p>"Others may not know, but I can't not understand what kind of person you are. However, today's matter should be seen as an exception. Isn't the danger a bit too great?" The word "danger" refers to Tsurumi speaking regardless of his own suspicion. As Yaoqun said this, a blush also appeared on her face.</p>
<p>At this time, Little Tiger, with his large eyes wide open, was busily darting them back and forth, from Tsurumi's face to Yaoqun's face, and then from Yaoqun's face back to Tsurumi's.</p>
<p>The room fell silent again.</p>
<p>"Aunt, don't you have something else to say?" Little Tiger broke the silence. It seemed that he had mustered up all his courage to speak, because his hands were clenched into tight fists as he spoke, as if preparing to fight.</p>
<p>Yaoqun seemed to wake up from a dream after being reminded by Little Tiger!</p>
<p>"Oh...! Mr. Yue," she smiled at me slightly, "Since Mr. Gu is also here, I'd like to mention something to you. After leaving Xiehe, Tiger and I happened to run into Zhang Jinlong at the Beijing Hotel, the one we invited to help out in Tongzhou. I told him that Tiger and I were immediately going to the Tongguan or Niangziguan area. I asked him if he could find a way to quickly notify the fort and ask our elder what is the number of people can he send to help..."</p>
<p>"Has Mr. W approved of this matter?" I interjected. A few days ago, after returning from Tongxian, I received a secret telegram from Tsurumi, on the one hand hoping that I would go to Japan, and on the other hand saying that the Lan Group of Doihara was preparing to actively enter Shanxi, and calling me to prepare to move to Shanxi as well. I had mentioned this to Mr. W, but there had been no concrete discussion of the relocation plan. I didn't expect Yaoqun and Hucheng to have begun to implement it in reality. Therefore, when I heard her asking the fort for brothers to help, I asked her if she had already received approval from Mr. W. This involves two issues: (1) Yaoqun and Hucheng have joined Mr. W's organization and must follow orders in everything; (2) The action must be economical, and there must be provision of armaments. This is not an action by one or two people, and cannot be done casually.</p>

<h3>敬老大會</h3>
<p>— 心耳</p>
<p>According to reports, Shenyang is "respecting the elderly" again. Another "Respect for the Elderly Assembly" was held. It is said that there were ninety-one elderly people over the age of seventy-one, and the ninety-five-year-old Wang Xihou was invited as the birthday star, and each person was given a piece of clothing material.</p>
<p>"Respect for the Elderly Assemblies" have been held many times. If one closes one's eyes and imagines it, the white-haired, wrinkled-faced old people gathered together, their expressions endearing, it must be quite a sight to see. In this day and age, human lives are like weeds. It is already difficult to survive, and it is naturally even more difficult to live to an old age. Not to mention a cannonball suddenly falling from the sky, even calmly soaking in yellow water or calmly eating grass roots is hardly a way to prolong life. I believe that the reason for "respecting the elderly" is quite profound.</p>
<p>When relief workers rush to a disaster area and see that the civilians are all pale and emaciated, they immediately conclude: they lack nutrition. So they get some canned milk or milk powder and call it relief. "Relief" is the opposite of "nutrition," which is a bit... awkward, as Shanghainese would say, isn't it? However, these nutritious items will disappear halfway. It seems that Chinese people have become accustomed to soaking in water and eating grass roots, and perhaps they can truly be refined into bodies of copper bones and iron tendons. Haven't our scholars already invented the theory that "Chinese people are a nation born to endure hardship"? In recent years, we have still been holding "Respect for the Elderly Assemblies" everywhere. "It is rare for a person to live to seventy years old since ancient times" is a well-known saying, which is originally the case, and should be rare. But whether this is related to copper bones and iron tendons is not known for a while.</p>
<p>If a Chinese civilian lives to be thirty years old, it becomes news. Generally, we don't hope for such days, do we?</p>
<p>Apart from this, I really can't think of any other reason for "respecting the elderly." If one says that living long is rare, and it is rare, why should one respect it? If this person has a career and writings that benefit the country and the people, then even if they are not old, they are worthy of respect, so why wait until they are old? And if this person has only lived a century in vain, leading a parasitic life, filling their stomach with bird's nest, white fungus, or vitamin pills, truly "eating their fill all day long, without using their minds," and therefore lives long, or worse, becomes riddled with illness, with phlegm everywhere, relying on others to serve them in order to live on, what is there to respect? (Should Tang Lhe and Zheng Xiaoxu be respected?)</p>
<p>"Respect the elderly and honor the virtuous" is an "ancient teaching," but what era is that "ancient"? There weren't as many gold bars and as much bird's nest and white fungus as there are today. The Great Harmony of the Book of Rites is still the political ideal of today. If we are to respect the elderly, I think it won't be too late after we have realized this ideal. Now, to burn incense and kowtow three times to a white beard, to put it more practically, should it be "celebration"?</p>
<p>If someone can be seen as living a thirty year life, it would be news, though most certainly such times shouldn't occur.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reasons for "venerating old age" are difficult to surmise. To say that longevity is rare is merely, rare - what reason is there to venerate? If the old-aged person performs heroic deeds or writes great texts, it would be worthy to venerate him if he benefits state and people, even were he not yet old. Yet what to do if some old aged man has lived a century merely to be parasitic, his stomach filled with luxury foods while idling, or more often, is riddled with illness, spitting phlegm as a burden to others, existing merely to survive. Is such a person worth venerating? (Should we venerate Tang Lhe and Zheng Xiaoxu?)</p>
<p>The common line "venerating old age and respecting the moral" comes from antiquity, but what specific ancient age is the one in question? There weren't as many gold bars and luxury foods then. I think only after a certain utopian dream is realised would it not be so late to venerate the old. It seems that burning incense and bowing to some white bearded old person is merely 'celebrating' his existence.</p>

<h3>Iodine and Detection</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Besides the few uses listed in chemistry textbooks, iodine (Clodine) can now also be used for detection work. It can be used to detect hidden fingerprints, as well as forged or altered paper bills. The procedure is very simple, but first, you need to know how to make iodine.</p>
<p>Industrially, iodine was previously derived from kelp ash. Now, most of it comes from Chilean saltpeter. As for making iodine at home for experiments, you can use tincture of iodine (iodine dissolved in alcohol). You only need to extract the alcohol from it to obtain iodine. The method is to pour the tincture of iodine into a large glass test tube, then gradually heat the tube with a lamp. After the alcohol has completely evaporated, the tube will emit a gas, purple like an eggplant and with a pungent, acrid smell. This is the characteristic of iodine vapor. Iodine vapor is very heavy and poisonous and should not be inhaled. When it reaches normal temperature, it becomes solid, and its properties are similar to chlorine gas.</p>
<p>When iodine vapor comes into contact with the cold wall of the upper part of the test tube, it condenses there into a solid. This direct transformation from solid to gas, and then directly back from gas to solid, without passing through the liquid state, is called "sublimation" in chemical terms.</p>
<p>Iodine can be used for "chemical detection" experiments. The iodine needed for this kind of "chemical detection" is not solid iodine, but purple iodine vapor. During the experiment, after pressing our fingers on a piece of white paper, of course, no trace will be visible on the paper. However, if you bring this paper into contact with iodine vapor, fingerprints will appear at the point of pressure, very clearly. If the paper just pressed by the fingers is stored away and tested several months later, the iodine vapor can still reveal the hidden fingerprints on the paper.</p>
<p>Iodine vapor can also be used to detect counterfeits. Whether it is paper that has not been touched, paper that has been erased with rubber, or dry paper and paper that has been wetted and then dried again, the colors revealed on the paper by iodine vapor can be used to distinguish them. Even traces made on paper by blunt objects can be revealed in the same way.</p>
<h3>### Fire</h3>
<p>— Translated from Esquire</p>
<p>"I heard your factory caught fire, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Yes! The losses are huge!"</p>
<p>"Are your factory's products flammable?"</p>
<p>"No, they're fire extinguishers."</p>
<h3>### Window of a Spring Morning (1)</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>Every house has its own window to welcome the spring morning; every person also has his own window to welcome the spring morning.</p>
<p>You open the window of your house every morning, open your own window, and look at this big city: is this really spring? Doesn't look like it, does it?</p>
<p>Winning the Lottery</p>
<p>Good news: "The four notorious mountain bandit gangs, operating in Shanghai, have been captured." Liu Hangxia, who impersonated an air force officer, reportedly confessed to being 21 years old and serving as their "Chief of Staff." It is alleged that he stole $30,000 in U.S. dollar bills belonging to Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen from the U.S. dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941).</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, U.S. dollar bills, and thirty thousand of them, that's better than winning any lottery.</p>
<p>Praising a Prodigy</p>
<p>But have you ever calculated that at that time, this Mr. Liu Hangxia was only fifteen years old? Ordinary children are probably in junior high school, while he was already serving as "Chief of Staff," although there might not have been any official appointment letter or anything like that.</p>
<p>He is a prodigy. What do you think, sir?</p>
<p>Destroying Talent</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but express our regret for the Railway Bureau's police department's success in cracking the case. They destroyed a genius.</p>
<p>If Mr. Liu's talent had been allowed to develop, he would definitely have achieved results exceeding thirty thousand U.S. dollars or the like.</p>
<p>Mocking Pedantry</p>
<p>No doubt, some people will discuss the issue of education because of this. So let me say in advance: this gentleman is extremely pedantic. His life can be considered over in China.</p>
<p>Incompatible</p>
<p>A friend living across the street is complaining again.</p>
<p>He earns 200,000 yuan this month, but he has a big plan: in addition to buying two dan of rice this month, he also wants to buy a new pair of leather shoes. Looking at the prices these days, he is very worried, saying that his plan is bankrupt and the new leather shoes will be in vain.</p>
<p>How stupid this person is. Is it really bad to eat without shoes? I bet he can still buy rice with those 200,000 yuan by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Considering the Past and Future</p>
<p>There's another aspect that also proves this person's stupidity. Serves him right to be worried. Because he hasn't thought comprehensively about the past and the future.</p>
<p>With his current monthly salary, he could imagine he is living in the spring of a year ago, when an income of 200,000 yuan was equivalent to 30 dan of rice. He would be very happy.</p>
<p>By analogy, he could also imagine that he is living in a year from now, when his money can only buy one dou of rice. So being able to buy two dan of rice now, wouldn't that be a great profit? He would also be very happy.</p>
<p>Emulating a Literary Master</p>
<p>Moreover, this person clearly cannot become a literary master.</p>
<p>For example, Balzac. He could sign a blank check for a large amount and hide it in his pocket, pretending to be very rich and swaggering through the market. -- A rich man is just someone with an extra check.</p>
<p>Learn from the literary masters.</p>
<h3>### 1947: The American Year</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>What are the chances of winning peace?</p>
<p>Any event that you encounter in 1947 is mathematically possible. You might get a million dollars, but the chances are slim; you might die, but that chance is also rare.</p>
<p>To give you a mathematical idea of the opportunities this year, Fortune magazine selected many ordinary and unusual, but possible, facts; it also lists many things that you couldn't buy during the war, and this year you can calculate your chances of buying them.</p>
<p>Of course, these numbers are not absolutely accurate. For example, strikes can affect the entire trading structure. However, the opportunities listed here are entirely based on known facts—including government statistics and writers' opinions. For example, the chances of an accident are based on insurance company statistics, and your chances of buying a new car are based on its production figures. Here is 1947:</p>
<p>Wedding Banquet</p>
<p>If you are married, your chance of having a child this year is one in twelve. One in ninety of the babies born in the United States this year will be twins, one in eight thousand will be triplets, and one in six hundred thousand will be quadruplets.</p>
<p>The chance of dying from lightning is one in 350,000. This year, 400 people will die from lightning in the United States.</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>The average chance of death this year is one in ninety-four: if you are under twenty, the chance of death is one in one hundred and ninety; twenty to forty is one in two hundred and sixty; forty to sixty is one in one hundred; seventy and over is one in thirteen.</p>
<p>The chance of burglary is one in four hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>The chance of drowning is one in nineteen thousand. In the year before last (1945), 7,150 Americans lost their lives this way.</p>
<p>The chance of going to jail is one in two hundred and seventy. In 1944, 488,976 people were jailed, and this year's total will definitely increase.</p>
<p>Car Accident</p>
<p>The chance of a car accident is one in three thousand four hundred. In 1945, the total number was 28,600.</p>
<p>The average chance of suicide is one in ten thousand: if you are under twenty, then the chance is one in one hundred and seven thousand seven hundred. Thirty to fifty is one in five thousand six hundred.</p>
<p>The chance of falling to death is one in four thousand nine hundred. This year, 27,800 people will die from falls.</p>
<p>The chance of a fire is one in one hundred and two. In 1945, 350,000 houses were damaged by fire.</p>
<p>The chance of getting a full hand in bridge is one in 635,013,559,600.</p>
<p>The chance of getting married is one in nine. Although this is based on age, three million American citizens will get married this year, and 500,000 babies will be born at the same time.</p>
<p>The chance of getting divorced is one in sixty. This year, about 500,000 couples will think that their union was a mistake.</p>
<p>Getting Rich</p>
<p>The chance of earning a million dollars is one in two million one hundred thousand. This number is based on last year's report from the U.S. Treasury Department. Only forty people netted a million dollars.</p>
<p>The chance of buying a car is one in two. American car companies' production can now supply this need.</p>
<p>Other household furniture: the chance of buying a washing machine is one in two; radio one in three; electric stove one in two; refrigerator one in two, vacuum cleaner one in two; full set of furniture one in two. These indicate the purchasing power of Americans.</p>
<p>The chance of building a new house is one in ten, and the chance of repairing one is one in four (translated from Fortune magazine's New Year's issue)</p>
<p>But we must ask: what are the chances of the American people winning peace this year?</p>
<h3>### A Year of Testing International Standing; Compatriots Overseas Face Disaster Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>Siam, once a tributary state of China, paid tribute to our country every year. Later, it was seized by Britain. Although it is now independent, it is still under British "protection." This newly emerging country, which once had a "courtly relationship" with China, clearly harbors an "old grudge" against its "former master" and is not very "friendly." It has always harbored a psychology of contempt and disdain towards overseas Chinese. Not only did it massacre them in the past, but now it does not allow overseas Chinese to receive education from their motherland. Last year, the government lodged a "serious protest" against this, but Siam ignored it and nothing came of it.</p>
<p>The Commissioner-General of the Siamese Police met with a Central News Agency reporter on the 3rd of this month, saying: "There are currently more than 300 overseas Chinese here waiting for transportation to leave the country; most of them have committed crimes such as 'murder and robbery,' 'violation of public security,' etc. Some of them should have been deported during the last war, but due to the lack of ships, they have been stranded until now..."</p>
<p>If they don't deport them, that's fine, but if they do, it's more than 300 people. This is the "special treatment" that Chinese citizens abroad receive. According to someone familiar with the situation, most of these deported overseas Chinese were arrested before the war for allegedly being anti-Japanese, and have been detained for several years. After the restoration of the motherland, they were not rewarded. Now, however, the Siamese authorities are accusing them of "murder and robbery," "violation of public security" and other "trumped-up" charges and deporting them.</p>
<p>American commentators have said: "1947 is a year of testing China's international standing." What we have seen in the past month or so is: peace talks are distant, French troops are landing in the Xisha Islands; overseas Chinese are being despised, bullied, "blocked" and deported abroad... The "achievements" of these "tests" are already "spectacular," and what will happen in the future is of course imaginable.</p>
<h3>### "The Terrible Half-Dozen"</h3>
<p>— Ming Gui</p>
<p>Dr. Hamilton of the University of California reported to the American Physical Society on February 1 that six new toxins have been discovered, all non-gaseous, all-metal substances derived from atomic fission, and are the most virulent toxins known to the scientific community. These six toxins are "praseodymium," "promethium," "americium," "cerium," "silver," and isotopes of iron, hence the name "The Terrible Half-Dozen." Americium and uranium can produce these six toxins when they split, but uranium itself is not as toxic as its products. These six new toxins are all ordinary metals, but when produced by atomic fission, they emit radiation as isotopes for months. When humans are attacked by radiation, bone marrow is their greatest weakness. Radiation kills bone marrow faster than other tissues. Toxins can reach the bone marrow by penetrating the inner layers of the bone. If eaten with food, they will not be transported into the bloodstream, so they cannot reach the bones and are excreted from the body without harm. If inhaled into the lungs by spraying or if the wound comes into contact with the toxin, it can reach the bone and be fatal.</p>
<p>The power of atomic energy can give life and can also cause death; it can heal human diseases and can also destroy human life; it can threaten peace and can also safeguard peace. Benefit and harm have absolutely different effects. After the invention of the atomic bomb, the lives and property of 100,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, were sacrificed in the first "field test," which also accelerated the end of the war and reduced a lot of consumption. Now, six new highly toxic substances have been discovered during the manufacture of atomic bombs. I wonder how many people's lives will be waiting to be "experimented on" with these six new toxins?</p>
<h3>### The Disabled Driving Cars</h3>
<p>— Gao Wu Hong</p>
<p>We often think: "What should a person who makes a living by technique do if they become disabled?" "If a car driver's hand becomes disabled, it's impossible to change careers, wouldn't they be unemployed and waiting for death?" In fact, in scientifically advanced countries, these kinds of shortcomings that were impossible to overcome by human power in the past are being remedied at all times.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch published by the British Information Service in London: In order to facilitate the driving of cars by people with artificial hands and feet due to disabilities of the four limbs, a certain British automobile company has been continuously researching for ten months and hired doctors and automotive experts as consultants. A new type of car has now been invented. Nine units of machinery are installed in the car. After it was manufactured, it was assisted and tested by disabled veterans. The results were excellent, driving was convenient, just like an ordinary vehicle.</p>
<p>Now this new type of car is already in mass production in the UK, but at present, because the domestic demand is quite large, it is not directly accepting reservations from other countries.</p>
<p>What was considered a difficult problem in the past is now being solved one by one. Man will conquer nature, science is truly omnipotent!</p>
