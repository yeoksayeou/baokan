<h3>策進收復區綏靖工作　白部長卽出巡蘇魯　蘇北綏區督導團隨行</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕確息：中樞爲策進收復區綏靖工作，安定民生，完成復與大計，業令由國防部綏靖區政務委員會組織督導團，至各綏靖區巡視，研討收復區當前待決之各項重大問題，就近設法解決，並切實督導施行，以宏實效。聞首批督導人員，將由國防部長白崇禧上將於本星期內親自率領，出發蘇北綏靖區巡視。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕白部長定下月一日前，親率蘇北綏靖區督導團要員一行十餘人，由京來鎭，省垣各機關，法國已準備作盛大歡迎。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕省主席王懋功，定下月初陪同白部長至蘇北綏站區巡視。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕據悉：蘇北綏靖區督導團來鎭時，將小作勾留，俾於出發蘇北收復區以前，在鎭舉行各界座談會，聽取政軍黨各方報告。據一般民意代表之意見，屆時適逢蘇省臨時參議會舉行大會之時，白部長或將應邀親臨該會，藉便聽取各代表提貢有關綏靖大計一切與革之寶貴意見。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿八日電〕據悉，國防部白部長，將於旬內來濟視察，魯南戰局將隨白氏之北來及郝鵬舉之接受政府任命，迅速開展。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕空軍總司令周至柔，廿八日千飛赴徐視察。</p>
<h3>郝鵬舉今赴徐請示　該部防區劃定七縣</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿八日電〕郝鵬舉率所部兩萬餘人，廿七日就任國民政府任命之魯南綏靖區司令官兼四十二集團軍總司令新職後，共軍極為惶恐不安。郝氏原定廿八日來徐請示，因事改廿九日由海州首途。</p>
<p>〔本報新浦廿七日電〕反正投誠之郝鵬舉，於廿七日下午二時三十分由包莊乘車來新，各界舉行盛大歡迎會，並設宴為郝氏洗康，下午五時乘車返原地。國防部任命郝鵬舉為魯南綏靖區司令官兼四十二集團軍總司令，防區為莒縣·蒙城·臨沂·日照七縣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕郝鵬舉部反正後，據中共駐京辦事處稱：尙未接獲此項電　，亦未加否認。對報載郝之通電，不表示任何意見。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕郝鵬舉率部反正之消息傳出後，蘇魯邊區之局勢已急轉直下，聞郝部一師於擊潰隴海東段北側之一部共軍後，現正會合二路國軍，向魯邊郯城急進，郯城共軍現正倉皇作退向台棗支綫之準備。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿八日電〕郝鵬舉部反正後，現正集中主力，準備向臨沂進擊，以搗魯南共軍之老巢。陳毅極為恐慌，正抽調部隊前往防阻。又收復邳縣之國軍，廿七日繼續推進，已到達溝上集迄沂水以西之綫，共軍狼狽北竄。</p>
<h3>流血苦戰兩晝夜　單縣守軍昨突圍　共軍對徐詐鉗形攻勢迄未收效</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿八日電〕魯西共軍劉伯誠部萬餘人，圍攻單縣，守軍流血苦戰兩晝夜，於今晨突圍，轉移陣地。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿八日電〕共軍三千餘人，廿五日夜進攻單縣東南廿里之龍王廟，國軍正堵擊中。又膠濟路中段已無大股共軍竄擾，臨魯境內刻僅有共軍李峯之獨立營四五百人活動。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿八日電〕由於共軍對徐州再度發動鉗形攻勢，以徐州爲中心之會戰序幕，現已正式揭開，共軍仍係以陳毅，劉伯或為東西兩鉗，惜此兩鉗始總未奏夾擊之效，當陳毅猛攻臨棗台支綫時，劉伯誠被國軍抑留於金鄕外圍，而無法脫身南窺隴海。今劉伯誠雖已進迫隴海邊緣，陳毅又被國軍以延翼競爭運動，迫其以主力自臨棗台支綫向海濱伸張，正面擴張至五百華里，戰塲正向「離心」方面發展，共軍之兩鉗愈夾愈開，此就戰略上而言，共軍已遜一籌，共軍在戰術上，仍係助少數牽制多數以多數殲滅少數，戰鬥上則迷信其以人海塡塡塞火海之蔑視人道觀念，國軍自蘇北魯南兩部會師後，對此已籌有對策。</p>
<p>〔又電〕魯西共軍劉伯誠部，積極向隴海路附近竄犯，意圖切斷汴徐交通，以威脅徐州，目前碣山以北及單縣附近已竄到共軍萬人，其先頭部隊約一個團，到達碭山北十公里處。又豐縣西二十公里亦發現共軍三四千名，另股共軍的兩個縱隊，廿七日竄向民權東西兩側地區，有圍攻民權之勢，該處國軍已嚴予戒備。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕碭山山民權間小扒車　，廿六日晚由北竄來共軍千餘，破壞附近鐵路。並燬大橋一座，該處一帶交通暫斷。</p>
<h3>某軍事觀察家　談魯西南戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿八日電〕舉國戰事重心，顯已移至魯南，由於嶧縣，城武，棗莊等地及共軍所宣傳誇張之決定性勝利，更引起國人對該區戰事之普遍關切。記者爲此特走訪某軍事觀察家，據談：共軍自撤出蘇北後，乃分三部分向國軍發動攻擊，（一）以自蘇北北撤之正規部隊與魯南原有部隊及魯中之解四，解九等師相配合，向臨，棗，嶧，台迤東與新安鎭隴海東段之綫猛烈攻擊。（二）以晋，冀，魯，豫邊區劉伯誠部精銳，向荷澤，定陶，城武，金鄉等魯西南地區全面進優。（三）以蘇，皖，豫邊區張太生等部，分向永城，亳縣，渦陽出擾，其整個企圖乃在鞏固魯南及重建魯西南根據地，逐漸及破壞隴海東段交通，重行進入蘇北，並進而威脅徐州。戰事進行半月餘以來，國軍因受停戰令限制，軍事上處處居於被動挨打劣勢地位，除蘇，皖，豫邊區方面共軍一度攻佔渦陽，旋即由國軍收復，但仍分攻永城，鹿邑外，津浦綫以東方面，嶧縣，棗莊相繼不守，臨城，台莊則被包圍，鐵路以西，黃河以南整　魯西南，除金鄉，鉅野，荷澤，嘉祥，魚台，定陶，單，曹等八縣城仍在我手，迄今在共軍各別圍攻中外，餘皆先後被共軍侵佔。總上所述，甫行展開之魯南決戰，共軍雖於初期略佔小惠，然此絕非如共軍所宣傳決定全盤戰局之勝利。再者，共軍近復自東北征調民主聯軍第四軍兩個師及一砲兵團在烟台登陸，並自晋，冀，察方面繼續調兵南下，足徴其過去犧牲之重及眞正決戰時期當在今後數月以內，而共軍之如此迷信武力，嚴拒和談，必致重踏長春及四平街戰事復轍，自食惡果，徒苦人民而已。</p>
<h3>運抵烟台共軍　內有日兵千餘</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿八日電〕中共東北民主聯軍第四軍魯濤部，已由大連運抵烟台，人數不詳，惟悉內有日軍一千四百人，部隊長爲谷野剛益，化名徐志雄。</p>
<h3>法軍登陸西沙事件　我已向法提抗議　越法當局竟稱該島屬法</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿八日電〕據可靠消息：中國外交部已向法國駐華大使梅里　提出關於法軍在西沙羣島登陸之抗議。時中同國駐法大使錢泰亦已以同樣照會送達法國政府，此間法風人士對此拒不加以評論，僅謂中國所提抗議，現正在加以研究中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿七日電〕此間法國當局頃向報界發表關於西沙羣島爭端之聲明，略謂：法國在兩個月前即已準備佔領該羣島，但派遣船隻前往一事，因海上氣候惡劣，遂一再遷延至今。自托倫港開出之法軍艦「東京人」號，載有少數軍隊，一部份奉命在波西島登陸，餘者在巴特爾島登陸。上述二島有一九三八年法軍所建軍隊營房碼頭及氣象合，可見主權屬於法國。「東京人」號於本月十七日駛抵波西島，獲悉島上駐有中國軍隊，法軍司令乃往吿知駐華軍長官此係法國領土，華軍無駐在島上之權。法軍繼即奉命重行登陸，在該島附近停泊廿四小時後，乃於十九日載一部份至巴特爾島登陸，發現該島幷無人駐防。此間官方人士幷謂「東京人」號開往四沙羣島前，中國報章載有會軍佔領之消息，但法方曾派飛機前往偵察，幷不見有華軍佔領之痕跡。法海軍陸戰隊且曾於去年五月間在西沙登陸，逗留十五日，幷未遇見華人。</p>
<h3>皖豫邊區共軍　有擾毫無渦企圖</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿八日電〕皖豫邊區共軍到處流竄，張太生，魏鳳樓部一萬二千餘人，盤踞鹿邑東北棗天集一帶，有進竄毫渦企圖</p>
<h3>中航失踪客機　依然幷無下落</h3>
<p>南川幷未發見該機</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕中國公司一〇三號飛機，廿八晨八時繼續出發，往南川等縣搜尋一三八號失事之穗渝客機，並於南川，巴縣交界處之石龍場上空，低飛盤旋甚久，下午飛返機場，失踪航機下洛仍無所獲。外傳石龍塲境內發現失踪客機之說，似有不確。據該公司負責人語記者稱：渠等除將繼續派機前往有降落可能之縣份搜索失事客機外，並將聽候總公司電示辦理一切應盡事宜。</p>
<h3>中航「南京」號　已安抵舊金山</h3>
<p>二月八日可返抵滬上</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿八日電〕中國航空公司DC—4型四引擎機「南京」號，載十九人，上星期五自上海飛出，今日安抵此間，中國民航機首决從上海至舊金山作調查飛行，遂吿完成。機上載中國人八名，及美國人十一名，抵此時，中國駐舊金山總領事張紫常在塲歡迎。「南京」號機員稱，返國時料將於二月二日左右到達上海。</p>
<h3>皮爾遜幫兇　定明日開審</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿八日電〕美軍强姦北大女生沈崇一案，其第一被告皮爾遜早由美軍法庭審訊定罪，尙有第二被吿將於本月三十日開審，惟被吿之姓名在起訴前不即宣布。其被控之罪，並非强姦，僅爲已知皮爾遜犯「姦非」罪，却未能盡力偵查，拘捕，使受懲處。此外並將控以毆打女生之罪。據沈崇前在法庭作證稱，當皮爾遜强姦時，第二美軍，曾握住其兩腿。</p>
<h3>徐海間修公路　電話亦正架設</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿八日電〕徐海間刻正就鐵道旁興工暫修公路，徐海間電話亦正架設中。</p>
<h3>立院審查總預算　聽取各有關方面之報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立院二十八晨開五委會聯席會議，審查三十六年度國家總預算，聽取各有關方面報吿。宋子文未列席，僅主計長徐堪及財部其負責人列席報吿，下午未開會，二十九日晨將繼續審查。</p>
<h3>顧總司令　日內返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕軍聞社訊：兼鄭州綏署主任顧祝同，因陸軍總部公務繁忙，未備兼顧，已奉令於日內返京。聞該署主任一職，以胡宗南繼任呼聲最高。</p>
<h3>定縣城內昨大火　飛機偵察證明縣城失陷　新樂鐵橋全遭共軍炸毀</h3>
<p>〔本報保定廿八日電〕廿八日干飛機偵察定縣，城內大火，縣城廿八日午十一時已失陷。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕平漢北段新樂與東畏壽兩車站均於廿六日夜陷共軍手，新樂縣城及定縣城仍在共軍圍攻中。東長壽爲新樂行唐兩縣政府所在地，黨政人員可能於廿六日晚隨軍撤出，現國軍正於東長壽南六里之幄刀溝隔河激戰，該鐵橋已被炸毀，國軍漸轉優勢，另辛安車站亦被共軍二個團攻擊中。石家莊北上車，僅通决站正定，平石段第二大橋之新樂鐵橋廿餘孔完全被共軍炸毀。平漢北段管理局副局長楊毅今吿記者，此次損失甚慘重，保石段已全入共軍掌握，鑑於平一保修復之艱難，且乏材料，縱重一行打通，亦難估計修復日期。另悉，孫連仲曾電交部速撥材斜，今接覆電，謂目下無辦法。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿八日電〕軍息：共軍自本月廿二日至廿六日進犯定縣城郊，集結兵力二萬五千餘，現仍繼續猛攻，新樂方面戰事亦甚激烈。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿八日電〕定縣城內守軍彈藥吿罄，危急萬分，二十七日晨由平空運補給，人心振奮，士氣旺盛，車站方面，鐵田車固守陣地。</p>
<p>〔又電〕滿城迤南順民村一帶共軍野二旅蕭印堂部三千餘，竄定縣北吳村鎭西山等地，企圖向定縣增援。又據定縣廿七日下午六時電報，車站仍在國軍手中，城內安然無恙，城郊正激戰中。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿八日電〕遼東半島右翼國軍收復石河西方簸箕島後，其東南之前後大連島，共軍已撤向石河方面，所有蘇軍哨兵亦已撤退。</p>
<h3>中長線附近共軍　仍圖進犯各車站</h3>
<p>松花江南路橋悉被毀</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿八日電〕企圖威脅中長路四平至泉頭間路綫之共軍，近日仍以小股部隊竄擾鐵路沿綫附近村落。據悉：雙廟子車站南四十里之棉花街，廿七日晨竄入共軍約千餘人，有山砲四門，輕重機搶十餘挺，企圖進攻泉頭，滿井，雙廟十等車站，國軍正戒備中。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿七日電〕松北共軍，自渡江南犯至被擊潰退之半個月間，將松花江南岸至德惠的三十五里之鐵道及大小橋梁盡行拆毀破壞，並燒毀松花江老少溝，廟北，達家溝，仲德等車站房屋達數百處，所有鐵路員工私人雜物，亦掠奪一空，高達四六七米爲中長路所有橋梁中基垜最高之狐狸洗三孔鐵橋（廟北達家溝間），亦慘遭破壞，該橋修復工作至爲艱鉅。</p>
<p>國防部闢謠</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕國防部軍事發言人，廿八日下午發表談話稱：本日報載鎭江消息稱，「今晨紅花埠又爲共軍攻佔」，「現新安鎭車站瓦窰兩跑雙方激戰慘烈」。又「共軍自嶧縣·宿羊山兩地對台兒莊採取夾攻形勢，另一路將由趙數車輻山直撲台兒莊」，幷謂「國軍繼續向台兒莊西北馬蘭屯反擊」等語，查紅花埠·新艾鎭車站·趙墩車站·瓦窰·宿羊山·車輻山·馬蘭屯等處，均早爲國軍駐守，日來上述各地並無戰鬥，乃鎭江方面近又不斷傳播此種絕對不確之謠言，顯係有人蓄意捏造，淆惑聽聞，希社會人士今後對鎭江方面所發出之消息，勿予輕信。</p>

<h3>和談暫無恢復希望　吳鐵城訪兩黨領袖</h3>

<h3>社論　德國問題的分析</h3>
<p>四國外次會議在倫敦開幕以來，即積極開始討論對德和的問題，不僅有關各國，尤其是荷蘭比利時浪蘭等國，紛紛提出對德要求，而且在英美與法蘇之間，對於德國問題的意見，各不相同。使四國外决會議遭遇到極大的困難，能否爲三月十日在莫斯科舉行的四國外長會議，完成其預備的任務，此際也不能斷言了。對德和的是歐洲問題的核心，有關於歐洲將來的安危；同時對德和的的內容如何規定，又是對日和的的一個榜樣，所以我們爲歐洲和平計，同時也爲遠東和平計，對於德國問題的解決，不得不特別重視。</p>
<p>蘇聯爲了加速解决德國問題，對於對德和約，特向四國外决會議，提出一項程序計劃，將起草對德和的的工作，分做三個階段：（一）在聽取各有關盟國陳述意見之後，由四強起草對德和的草案；（二）至德國中央政府成立之後，召開盟國會議准許德國政府派遣代表到會，陳述意見，然後再討論對德和的草案；（三）四强決定對德和的最後條款，然後由各國簽字，再交各盟國政府批准，即發生效力。</p>
<p>這一個提案，英美法三國代表的觀感如何，目下雖無從探悉；但從這三個程序看來，即可證明：對德和的的成立非易。何况各盟國的意見，因爲利害的不同，立塲的懸殊，又極不一致。怎樣在紛歧的意見中求得大同？又在求得大同之後，怎樣消除各國的小異？都是非常嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>對德和的中最主要的問題，一爲德國賠償的總額及其償付的方式；二爲如何管制德國？在積極方面，要實行德國人民的再敎育，肅淸德人所受納粹的麻醉及其餘毒，俾使德國也成爲愛好和平的國家，不復成爲歐洲和平的威脅；在消極方面，也要監督德國在軍事上經濟上解除其武裝，不致在數年之後，德國又能東山再起，再事侵略。但自德國投降之後，即由盟國加以管制，迄今將近兩年，至於管制的成績如何？各人所見，各不相同，據歐洲問題國際研究會所發表的報告稱，兩年來肅淸納粹工作竟遭完全失敗，在盟國管制下的德國境內仍保留着納粹的餘孽，企圖利用逃避在國外的資金，有裨於將來復國。這一篇報吿，雖不能完全置信，但値得負責管制德國的當局深思的。今後如何管制德國，以防止德國侵略勢力的東山再起？的確要從長討論的。</p>
<p>自去歲紐約四國外長會議與第二屆聯合國大會閉慕以來，英美與蘇聯的關係，雖已見好轉的端倪，但對於許多問題，尤其是對德和的問題，意見仍未能一致。盟國管制德國委員會於本月廿日開會時，德境蘇軍總司令索相爾斯基元帥就在席間發表演說，指摘英美兩國代表，對於調整委員會起草四國聯合報吿書，横生阻撓，務使其起草不成。英國官方雖已予以否認，並表示英國政府的見解，也正與索元帥的意見相同；但是英美與蘇聯對德政策的不一致，也可於此獲一明證。據聯合社華府電，美國新任國務卿馬歇爾元帥將於三月間莫斯科四國外長會議時，提議訂立英美法蘇四國禁止德國重整軍備四十年同盟條的；馬帥的提議，能否獲得四國外長會議的通過，此際殆難逆料。</p>
<p>緣此項禁止德國重整軍備四十年條約。在一年前早已由美國前任國務卿貝爾納斯所提出，史丹林元帥雖在原則上亦表示贊同，但經外長莫洛托夫的反對，因此未能見諸事實，而無形擱置了。現在馬歇爾國務卿舊事重提，事前雖得到蘇聯外交當局的諒解，紐約外長會議曾同意將此項四强同盟條約列入莫斯科四國外長會議的議程內，但是能否獲得外長會議的通過而告成立，則將視英美與蘇聯的關係如何而定。平心而論，馬帥所提出的四國同盟條約，實為防止德國侵略勢力東山再起的最好辦法。</p>
<p>要之，四國外次會議討論德國問題，雖已遭遇許多障礙，但是四國外長若能高矚遠瞻，咸以世界和平為重，則任何棘手的問題，都不難謀得解決辦法。索柯爾斯基元帥的指摘英美，顯為蘇聯奧英美仍缺乏互信互忍的精神的表示。在此舉世盼望四強合作早日解決德國問題的今日，我們對此不能不表示扼腕。</p>
<h3>華北奇寒　大沽口外冰凍　鄂北大雪交通阻塞</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿七日電〕據華北氣象台報吿：自西伯利亞寒流侵入華北以來，北平因連日皆在此寒流控制區域內，氣溫曾連日大降，昨夜因天空晴朗，地面熱之輻射增强，加以地上雪面不斷漲發，繼續吸收空氣之熱，於是氣溫益降，於今晨二時半降低爲攝氏零下十九。五度，此低溫繼續的一小時左右，始漸上升，因當時風力極弱，且正在深夜，故吾人稍有感覺，此種低度爲平市近廿年來所未有，現寒流勢力已漸轉弱，溫度當可略升。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿七日電〕津市連日酷寒，低溫在攝氏零下十六度點六，爲十年來罕有奇寒，大沽口外凍冰卅海里，自民國廿五年二月中旬以來之首次，輪船多艘均被凍陷，現正營救中，新港甫行修成之閘口亦被凍壞，秦皇島港口亦經封凍，十餘艘輪船均無法進港。</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖春蠶期近　繭貸預定三百億</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州訊〕中蠶公司為發展國內蠶絲事業，對本年度蘇浙皖三省之春蠶貸款，已進行籌　中，預定貸款數字為三百億元。又關於日繭運華問題，連日又喧傳市上，據悉：去年中蠶公司　向來帥總部提出物物交換辦法，以吾國食鹽換取日本剩餘幹繭，當時擬定繭價每磅穩美金－尤，迨至去年九月間，日本推翻前議，未將剩餘乾繭運華，經一再交涉，亦無結果。至最近始　將以一千萬磅乾繭，每磅以美金二元七角七分價售予吾國，但每磅生絲之　成，平均至少須乾繭三磅半，目前生絲市價每磅僅值美金六元至七元左右，若以每磅價值美金二元七角七分之價給　製生絲，則每磅生絲之成本將超渝美金八元，與現行市儂相差甚遠，且國內　絲勞最近大部均已停業，故日繭運華問題，尚難領期。</p>

<h3>日本內閣總辭職　吉田茂將受命組織新聯合內閣　昨日全國舉行倒閣大會</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日電〕吉田茂內閣總辭職，吉田將受　組織新聯合內閣，正式文吿，可望於本日午後二時宣布。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿八日電〕日首相吉田昨已認爲聯合內閣可以組成，今日決心俟社會黨方面表明最後態度，即召開臨時閣議，實行總辭職。然社會黨委員長片山今日仍謂政府方面迄未正式或非正式向社會黨表示任何意志，社會黨對聯合政府問題。仍堅主改變石橋藏相之財政政策，樹立新政權，必須由自由，進步，社會，協民，國民五黨共同協商，以上數點，絕對不能讓步。政府倘能接受社會黨之主張，則社會黨當欣然與之談判，否則請由自由進步兩黨自行踏破危局。至自由黨方面則堅主石橋藏相留任，故石橋問題已成組織聯合內閣之極大障礙。</p>

<h3>日本黷武主義　一時尚難撲減</h3>
<p>我駐日代表團首席顧問見解</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿八日電〕中國駐日代表團首席顧問沈君頃發表談話稱：日本之復員在「形式上」進行順利，但其黷武主義在短期內則尙難加以撲滅，故吾人尙需密切注意日本黷武主義根苗之封建傳統思想是否能先予澈底剷除，中國代表團對於日本之解除軍備及實行民主化，當能在各方面予以合作，俾使日本成爲和平國家，此與亞洲及世界皆有裨益。最近莫斯科報童所稱約有日本軍官百人，取得日本當局之同意後，即將前往中國協助中國政府軍，此說「純係無稽之談」，又傳有日本軍官多人，偽裝爲中國軍官在南京軍隊中工作一說，本代表團亦並無所聞。其次，日本國內情形，吾人今應查究有無復員軍人潛入社會之間活動，今日本警察局頗多起用此輩軍人，對於復員軍人雖爲自然出路，但亦應注意其後果，如去歲澀谷事件，警察開槍擊斃台胞六人，廿人受傷一事，即可見其未脫强暴根性，日本憲法中詆毀戰爭之條款，自値得加以讚揚，但其眞正價値尙需視其能否忠實履行而定，中國對此，當力促日本尊重此條款。關於國際裁減軍備一項計劃，余常視爲力人類最崇高之目標之一，亦即聯合國東大工作目標之一，日本待其有加入聯合國之資格時，其自衛權一事將成一「微妙」之問題，但大國政治家遏阻戰爭之努力，當不致徒勞無功，故亦不致使日本處於爲難之地位中，中國乃愛好和平之國家，莫不痛恨再發生第三次世界大戰云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕今日自權威方面得悉，一部份日本資產，即將開始分配與提出要求各國，作爲賠償。按照目前決議，此項被分配資產，計有軍需工廠一千一百所。分配方法將由美國向麥帥發出訓令執行，美國爲佔領日本之主要國，故賦有此權。惟日本軍需工廠之即行拆運分配，並未能解決全部賠償問題，遠東委會各國間仍將繼續發生爭執委會對於進行分配工作雖守口如瓶，惟聯合社記者敢言，與賠償問題有關係之各方面已可指示，委員會與其他關係方面對於根據一九三一年份之日工業機稱決定日本戰後所需設備一點，殆已同意。日本戰時工業發展，着重於鋼鐵及其有關部份，不致影響根據此點所定之全部賠償方案。一九三一年即日本發動瀋陽事變，開始侵略冒險行動之一年，聯合國將根據事變前之情形，起草賠償方案。最近美國提議請遠東委會各國對此提出建議，即爲加速進行起見，惟委會中若干國家仍不願參加，故其進步遲緩。各國似以為一旦承認美國提議，將使全部問題爲美國一手把持，且以爲美國最近之提議，其基本目的在避免蘇聯對於日本賠償問題之攻擊。</p>
<p>美蘇意見　顯然不同</p>
<p>遠東委會最初企圖召開會議解決此項問題，因遭蘇聯反對而中止。嗣後，美國務院即考慮另行召開會議，亦因蘇聯不允將紅軍在中國東九省所獲「戰利品」作為賠償物資論，國務院遂放棄此意。若干國家對於臨時分配賠償物資辦法不免提出疑問，以爲未必能適應賠償國家之目前需要。日本工廠具有高等之技術設備，需技術人員加以運用，分得此等工廠各國，是否有充分技能之人與以有效利用，不能無疑。至於接受賠償物資之國雖未經指定，大的以中國與菲律賓居重要地位。</p>
<h3>美代表團抵日</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿八日電〕美國賠償代表團一行七人，奉陸軍部長柏德遜之派，前來與麥帥討論日本賠償問題，已於今晨抵此。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日電〕日官方稱：美駐日代表艾其森將於明靈機返國與國務院作例行之諮商，同機赴美者，有前法駐華大使貝志高。艾氏可望於三四週內返日，離日期間職務由弼活代理。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕遣送船隻自海外載來日本孤兒寡婦，日益增多，此輩之父親與丈夫，均爲「大東亞戰爭」之犧牲者。多數婦人，其丈夫一去戰塲，即無下洛。婦女遣送協會估計，海外歸國之婦孺的三百萬人，其中多數爲陣亡軍人家屬。</p>
<h3>希臘宣布外交政策　願與鄰邦保持友誼　決用全力消減國內游擊隊</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿七日電〕新總理馬克西莫斯所組成之七黨聯合政府，今日宣佈新政府擬進行與盟國列強作平等友交及與巴爾幹地中海諸鄰邦維持友好關係政策。馬氏在衆院宣稱：希臘之外交政策，乃就其歷史與地理之地位而制定者。希臘旣爲巴爾幹國家之一，同時又爲地中海國家之一，故願與其巴爾幹及東地中海諸鄰邦維持友好關係，締結商業聯繫，以求相互獲益。馬氏又聲明政府對於國中之游擊隊，擬取堅決應付政策，政府決議修正前敵僑解送回國辦法。關於婦孺解送命令，將中止執行，並將大赦於限期內投到之叛徒。</p>
<p>今日下午復有部長十六人决長七人宣誓就職，新政府現仍未完備，因前右翼游擊隊首領齊爾伐斯將軍所領導之國民黨，對於公安部與郵電部二席尙未決定人選也。新政府七黨之席位，乃依七黨在衆院所佔之勢力分配，新政府計有人民黨（保王黨）十六人，自由黨四人，國民自由黨三人，社會民主黨四人，工聯改革黨國民然谷一人。</p>
<h3>蘇駐英大使　與貝文晤談</h3>
<p>料與盟約事有關</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：據官方稱：英外相貝文昨在倫敦與蘇聯駐英大使柴羅平會談時，曾檢討貝文最近與史達林互通函件內涉及之問題，但該方面並未說明昨日談話究係何種性質。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕蘇駐英新大使柴羅平今日下午至英外部第一次拜會外相貝文。消息靈通方面相信，貝文曾與之討論展長一九四二年英蘇盟約期限之可能性，而將史達林最近與英外相交換函件時所述及的中之「保留」刪除。同時據可靠消息，英法盟約已在外部起草中，惟尙未提交內閣，一面並與法當局商議進行正式談判之最佳方法。</p>
<h3>遠東軍法庭上　日本戰犯猶圖卸罪</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿八日電〕遠東國際軍事法庭今日續審日本戰犯，前華中日本派遣軍司令松井之辯護律師，爲南京大屠殺案代被吿提出辯訴稱：攻擊南京之命令係東京大本營所頒發，松井司令部設於蘇州，對日軍殘殺及强姦之事，並不知情。前日本駐華大使重光葵則稱：僅在日本外交界供職，與日軍侵略之事並無關係。彼曾反對德日義三國同盟，且除傳達聯合國對於日軍虐待俘虜之抗議外，其他概不負責。</p>

<h3>二次大戰秘聞</h3>
<p>投在廣島和長崎的原子彈，是當時美國僅有的兩枚。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕前任陸軍部長史汀生今日在本期「哈波」雜誌發表一文稱：一九四五年八月在廣島及長崎投擲之原子炸彈，乃當時美國僅有之兩枚。軍事當局深信除非施用原子彈，戰爭最早非至一九四六年下半年不能結束，是則美國軍隊即須單獨死傷一百萬人以上。</p>
<p>美保守秘密　日不知底蘊</p>
<p>美國對於原子炸彈極端保守秘密，日方因之無從得知究竟，以爲吾人實施原子攻擊之能力無限，必要時可以大隊飛機同時攻擊，遂決定投降，實則吾人已罄其所有矣。吾害相較取其經，原十炸彈投落廣島長　結束大戰，並充分召示吾人切不可再有戰爭。</p>
<p>史汀生並稱：自一九四一年至一九四五年之間，余迄未聞羅斯福總統或政府其他主管人員有原子能不應用於戰爭之意。一九四五年四月廿五日，余曾面吿杜魯門總統。謂美國已能製造及利用原子彈，其他各國數年內均望塵莫及。</p>
<p>當時日兵力　尚有五百萬</p>
<p>一九四五年夏季日本總兵力計有陸軍五百萬人，突擊飛機五千架。是年七月，日本海軍，除足以牽制進攻其本土之美國艦隊外，殆已蕩然無存。美國決定進攻日本本土戰略時，並朱將原子彈計算在內。吾人如照此計劃，於預定之一九四五年十一月一日進攻日本本土，則Ｂ—二九型空中堡壘再加五次大轟炸，日本人生命財產之損失必超過兩次原子彈轟炸。惟原子彈在心理上之威力尤大。</p>
<p>史汀生並稱：原子彈之製造過程複雜，僅有少數人知其底細。史氏在一九四五年四月廿五日致杜魯門之備忘錄中，宣布其他國家不能於數年內到達美國之地位。並稱將來較小國家製造原子炸彈，或較大國家在極短時期內製造原子炸彈，未必可能云。</p>
<p>施用原子彈　杜魯門決定</p>
<p>〔聯合社波士頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統曾於戰時親自決定施用原子彈進攻日本。此事在二月號「大西洋月刊」總統致麻州理工學院院長康普敦一函中透露。康普敦曾在該月刋撰文，謂原子炸彈曾拯救美國與日本數十萬人甚至數百萬人之生命，並將戰爭縮短數個月。總統函稱：「大西洋月刋所載大作，實爲對於實際情形之公正的分析，惟此事最後決定不得不出諸總統，且於事前統盤作周密檢討。日本人曾接到無綫電警吿，並在原子彈落下前曾獲悉屈服條件，此項條件終被接受，余以爲此乃原子彈之功」。康普敦在原子彈投擲前兩個月，曾供職於馬尼刺麥帥總部，據稱，事後與日本科學家談話證明大多數日本人相信彼等正在戰勝中，直至宣布投降，始如夢初醒。</p>
<h3>建立集體安全制　端賴管制原子能　奧斯汀宣布美國政策不變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國駐聯合國機構首席代表奧斯汀，今日與國務卿馬歇爾進行會談後，向人談稱：美國對於國際管制原子能之政策，幷不改變。據悉：奧斯汀與馬卿進行會談，歷一小時四十分鐘之久，關於裁减軍備及管制原子能問題，展期至二月四日由安理會提出討論一事，聞奧斯汀已決定屆時不再提出展期之要求。美國素來創導裁軍，現當益加積極。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿七日電〕聯合國安理會業代表奧斯汀頃在紐約州律師協會發表演說，謂建立原子能及其他軍備國際管制制度，包括懲處違犯者之規定，乃建立集體安全制度之重要工作。渠謂建立集體安全制度係當前亟務，若此項制度果能建立，而有效國際管制（包括國際視察）及懲處違犯者之規定亦能具備，則吾人當能獲致某種保障，俾世界各國能安然縮軍。若無此項制度，世界各國均無從獲致安全，亦無法縮軍。世界各國建立此項制度之代價，爲進一步委以主權，此事且與文明有關。人類之抉擇已不再爲下次大戰勝負誰屬，今後之抉擇在於防止第三次犬戰及免受原子彈及其他摧毀力更大之或有武器之害。吾人對於吾人前途上之障礙，不能加以掩飾，忽視或誇大之。吾人不能曲解當代之基本概念及必要之條件。聯合國之基礎奠定於現實，其憲章及所屬機構之潛在力量，實遠在一般臆測之上。奧斯汀重申其立塲謂，美國反對安理會五常任理事國之一致原則有任何變更，渠復指出聯合國憲章第一條款及第五十一條款曾有規定，防止常任理事國輕易使用否決極以使安理會無法擴展工作。</p>
<h3>蘇聯無誠意</h3>
<p>秘密從事科學研究　美參議員施抨擊</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕參議院原子能委會主席即民主黨參議員麥克瑪洪曾主持草擬國內原子管制方案，今日在參院發言，促請成立國際管制協定。據稱，原子智識必須立即實行管制，吾人擁有此項炸彈固無危險，但他人亦有之，媽足致吾人於死命。今日吾人無法獲悉其他國家對於原子武器之製造，已進步至若何程度，但知其他國家正在日夜研究。吾人長此無正確之知識，即將受恐怖與懷疑之困惱。例如不久以前接到蘇聯方面報吿，謂該國之核子物理學家卡比柴因犯某種罪而放逐至西伯利亞，自余觀之，不如解釋爲卡比柴現正在烏拉爾山脈背後，忙於原子分裂實騐所之建造工作。蘇聯如誠心希望禁止原子彈及其他火規模破壞武器，極應接受美國之管制方案。美國會原子能聯合委會主席一職，現已由共和黨參議員希根洛柏繼任，該會即將於下週一與杜魯門總統之聯邦原子能委會進行研究工作。</p>
<h3>原子能用於工業　兩三年內可成功</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日電〕商務部科學技術司主任高登今日宣稱：原子能當於兩三年內用作工業能之源泉。釷質與　質（原子材料）可用作燃料，散發熱力蒸氣與電力，並無疑問云。</p>

<h3>艾帥發表演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美參謀總長艾森讓威爾今日在某一美國報紙婦女俱樂部發表演說稱，蘇聯之人民均極願建立對美國之友誼。渠稱，俄人對其祖國均有深切之愛，並又謂，「某一俄人吿余云，俄國領袖深悉，蘇聯人民即使不爲共黨而鬥爭，亦將爲俄國而鬥爭」。艾氏斷言無一任何大國，眞正在挑撥戰爭，因無國家已準備就緖，更無國家能忍受戰爭，然此亦非戰爭不將發生之謂。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕法國總司令部今日宣布：越盟軍隊正自河內西北兩面後退，秩序混亂，紅河與大湖間整個區域現完全在法軍控制下。河內亞洲人住居區域附近，越盟軍隊數次小規模進攻，均被擊退，越軍損失重大</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：駐河內中英美領事承認彼等曾出席維明政府官方之宴會，但切實否認對於維明電台所宣傳之王張，曾從旁加以鼓勵，英美兩國領事謂彼等及中國領事應維叫政府之邀請，於一月廿二日前往維明地區，以便視察當地情形，並商討有關民衆撤退之問題。</p>
<h3>印外交部宣布　暫不選派　駐外使節</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新德里廿七日電〕印度外交部今日宣稱：國內外報載印度即將選派駐外使節，純係捕風捉影之談，毫無根據。外間猜測多集中於可能任命尼赫魯之姊潘狄德夫人爲駐蘇聯大使一事。</p>
<h3>貝文宣布　英埃談判　正式破列裂</h3>
<p>埃衆院通過信任案</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕貝文外相今日在下議院宣布，英國與埃及修改一九三六年同盟條約談判，已因埃及堅持兼併蘇丹而告破裂。同時據開羅電，埃及總理諾克拉奇亦向該國議會宣稱，埃及要求英軍撤退，希望將來談判時，英方能度能較爲寬大，英埃同盟條約將於一九五六年滿期作廢，目下埃及自當加以遵守</p>

<h3>掌握美國國運的　共和黨領袖羣像</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室譯述</p>
<p>雖然白宮中僅有一個總統，但華盛頓却有着很多握有集體權力的幕後　統，那就是國會中的共和黨領袖們。在這次國會中，共和黨以闊別十六年的姿態，重回華盛頓，掌握議會的權力。現在他們是美國內政外交政策的實際決定者。</p>
<p>國會中美國人民最熟悉的共和黨領袖們是塔虎脫，范登堡，鮑爾和馬丁。他們都是能直接影響國策的國會人物；同時，他們對於下年度的稅收，軍備，建設和勞工政策等都有決定的力量。他們希望减少政府的行政經費，限制聯邦政府的極力，取消華盛頓的商業干預政策，並大大變更現行的勞工法規。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我們對這些共和黨的首領們作一點簡略的介紹：</p>
<p>塔虎脫是參議院中共和黨議員的領袖，他有左右國內立法的力量。塔氏態度文雅，和靄可親，像個敎書先生，在上决國會中，他對於各種主要法規的修訂曾有很大的貢獻，同時也曾對杜魯門總統的物價統制法案作有力的抨擊。去年夏天，杜魯門總統以軍力鎭壓鐵路工人罷工時，塔氏也立於反對的地位。他是共和黨中保守派的領袖，主持着參院的敎育與勞工問題委員會。現在塔氏是共和黨中對國內問題的發言人。</p>
<p>在外交方面，共和黨中最主要的人物自然是范登堡。</p>
<p>范氏是參院外交委員會主席，對於外交政策的決定，有極大的影響力量。這個人頭腦開明，可以說是共和黨中除威爾基之外最最有「天下一家」思想的人物。范氏是新聞記者出身，因爲他善於詞令，在參院中確已出了不少風頭。現在，在議會中，他尋股反對孤立主義的熱情，實在任何一個共和黨員之上，但是追溯他的過去，他却是個十是的孤立主義者，甚至在一九四〇年德軍佔領法國的時候，他和大多數共和黨員都曾依然反對軍備方案。及至珍珠港事件爆發以後，他才放大眼光，採取國際主義的政策。</p>
<p>其次我們說到馬丁。馬氏在衆議院有相當勢力，將來可能成爲衆議院的發言人。他態度也極和議，而且富有組織力，不抽烟不飲酒，主張加强黨紀，制止反叛。考究馬氏的過去，也是和范登堡一樣的孤立政策者，所以在一九四〇年時他曾遭受過羅斯福總統的猛烈抨擊。</p>
<p>馬氏五風時開始做報童，十八風任一家報館的採訪記者，二十四歲時任紀事晚報的發行人，從未受過高等的學校敎育，他的槪念是：</p>
<p>「共和黨的責任是拯救國家，以保持美國人的生活方式。」</p>
<p>最後來談鮑爾。飽氏高大而粗　，做過新聞記者，一九四〇年因史塔生的引進而投身政界。他以促進國際合作的主張引起了全美國人士的注意。以後他又從事剝弱勞工集團權力的運動。鮑爾現年四十二歲，他的妻子彼蒂女士幫助他處理政務。他們家裏不用女傭，鮑爾先生從議會回來就幫助太太洗碟子</p>
<p>總之，從今以後，美國的大部份命運確已在這輩有力議員的掌握之中了，但美國傳統的「平衡」制度，也仍是有效地存在着。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦英國高等專員　限令猶人交出被綁英人</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撤冷廿七日電〕駐巴勒斯坦英國高等委員克寗漢爵士今夜吿知猶太領袖，謂茍非將猶太恐怖黨現拘禁之二英人於指定時間內安全送返，則將在某某區撤退民政與種種便利，而够置軍事管制之下。二英人一為前陸軍少校，一為地方法院法官，聞已限令於四十八小時內送返。此項「哀的美敦書」乃致與猶太公會執行部委員邁爾斯夫人及台爾阿維夫市長羅加樞者，合爾阿維夫地方猶太恐怖黨益見猖獗，大局顯頗嚴重，自日暮至黎明，猶太全城嚴禁宵行，聞非猶太人之英國平民現紛紛離城，以免有被綁之虞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撤冷廿八日電〕英軍第六空運師大隊士兵於今日淸晨飛至台拉維夫，開始搜尋昨晨被綁之區法院首席法官溫丹。</p>

<h3>郭泰祺房產訟　租戶不允遷讓　奉判上訴高院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利以來本市房荒嚴重，金條頂屋之風盛行，房東與房客之間亦因而時生糾紛。最近有黨國要人郭泰祺之在滬房產，亦因租賃關系涉訟，緣郭氏在本市泰安路置有房產四幢，武康路置有房產兩幢。向由吳商公和洋行地產部代為經租。勝利後的移轉上海銀行信託部經租，數月前以房主收回自用為理由，書面通知各租戶限期遷讓不再續租。各住戶因值此房荒嚴重時期無力遷移，迄未遷行，經房主訴諸法庭，判令遷讓，並予假執行。但各住戶以租住該處房屋歷有年所，政府對於房客保障會迭有規定，且郭氏眷　已住其中一宅，故奉判不服，巳向高等法險上訴。</p>
<h3>蔣經國訪問難童　勗勉努力學技能　一千六百餘個流浪兒　收容所中得到了新生</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕當你走進漕河涇收容所以後，你見到廣大的操塲，整齊的院舍，塲內數百個孩童，小至七八歲，大的十八九歲，一個個都穿得非常整潔。淡灰的棉童軍裝，黑跑鞋，白襪白手套，臉色紅潤，上操時精神抖擻，舉動整齊。你又會聽到小軍樂隊熱練的奏樂，歌詠隊歌聲宏亮。閱覽室內擠滿了小朋友搶着圖書，上課時津津有味靜聽講師講解。自由遝動的時候，穿上了跑冰鞋，溜來又溜去的，讓你感到充滿了生氣和活力。可是，你能相信他們中間大部份都曾做過乞丐，扒手，小偸，小三，水老鼠，小流氓嗎？記者昨日參觀該所的時候，正由庇寒所送進去六十個馬路小朋友，有幾個是受了後母虐待經家裏逃出來的還有一個小和尙因爲經不起老和尙惡打逃出來偸東西混日子。有癩痢頭的，也有滿頭蓬髮的，大多臉上手上衣服上都是骯髒，和操塲上的孩子們一比，眞是差遠了。其實，據說那些訓練好的孩子，在初進去時比昨天所見那些新來的更不如，因爲那批新的已經在庇寒所內有吃有穿的住過三個月了。</p>
<p>難童來自不同的地方。有警察局捕送進去的流浪兒，有家長無法管敎的頑童，有迷途的，有被人拋棄的，過去一年來，在所長周祖望辛勞主持下，已收容過四千個難童。現有一千六百名：其中包括少數成人及一百多個小女孩。所中新收到孩子時，第一件事是登記，然後是剃光頭，洗澡，消毒，換衣服，檢査身體，最筏送心理感化室編號。</p>
<p>收容所的組織嚴密有紀律。孩子們一切活動。都自己照顧，除了少數職員外，洗衣，煮飯，管理，都是幾位「爺叔（大　三）」或難民担任的。而最令人感覺有趣和欽佩的，是他們自己有小法處。這小法庭絕對民主，三四個小法官都是「吳選」出來的。昨天記者們去參觀時，小法正在審問案件，倒也頗審愼周到。據說逢到大一些的案件，法官還須和其他陪審官商量後，始能宣判。最重的罪是偸竊同伴物品，（如鉛筆　子之類），或欺詐同伴糖果等，還有企圖逃走的，受到的處罰有關在黑房子內二星期之久，或禁閉等等。</p>
<p>孩子們分組各種隊伍，有許多大小隊長，甚至還有癩痢頭隊長，專管癩痢頭小朋友。患有惡疾的則都隔離治療。</p>
<p>學習技術留待國用</p>
<p>昨天，孩童們特別感到興奮的，是到了一位貴賓，就是蔣敎育長經國。蔣敎育長由靑年團上海分團長吳紹澍和書記長曹俊陪同，在十一時半到所內參觀，首先檢閱隊伍，參觀各種活動，並致訓詞，略稱：「希望你們不要以爲自己窮而灰心，你們應該好學習有用技術，將來爲國家服務。」</p>
<p>眞的，誰能說，這許多孩子們中，將來沒有一個出類拔萃的大人物呢！即以目前而論，這些孩子們對於社會、也並非絕無貢獻。他們除了把自己改造成一個新的兒童外，還幫助上海市民，天天淸除堆積着垃圾，又組織掘河隊，挖掘陰溝內的汚物。</p>
<p>可是單算精神感導是不够的，也須給以物質上的供養。收容所當局，尤其是周所長，對這些孩子們抱著地限希望，早就定了各種計劃。可是沒有社會人士的幫助，工作是難以進行的。所內每月開支約在三千萬以上，吃的麵粉由行總供給。市府限於經濟，每月津貼的極有限，其他收入全都賴熱心慈善事業的先生太太們陸續捐助。吳市長夫人參觀該年後，十分感動，常常送些肉給孩子們吃，固爲平時他們每人每餐祇吃些靑菜麵團羹。他們夜問睡在水門汀上，但都舖有草褥，每人並有棉被一條。整潔紀律，不亞於軍隊。難怪蔣敎育長說，他們操練整齊，比空軍幼年學校的</p>
<p>大慈善家損贈巨欵</p>
<p>周所長希望今年能把院舍改造，鋪上地板，那末孩子們睡眠時不致太冷。此外計劃舉辦國民敎育。現在校舍幸而不成問題，已有某大慈善家認捐二萬萬元興建。此外計劃舉辦國民敎育，並爲訓練專業，籌劃設立（一）汽車駕駛修理幼年班，（二）造紙印刷班，（三）音樂戲劇舞誦幼年班，（四）應用美術幼年班，（五）幼年紡織班，（六）農業幼年班，（七）縫級製革幼年班，（八）無綫電管理幼年班，（九）建築幼年班，（十）侍應生幼年班，（十一）看護幼年班，（十二）打字員幼年班，（十三）電話接綫生幼年班，（十四）理髮幼幼年班。但據周所長表示，其他各班都有本市大工廠商帮助解決，惟有汽車駕駛修理一班，無法開辦，而也是孩子們最喜歡的一件工作，所以正為着這事傷腦筋呢！</p>
<p>一面錦旗受之有愧</p>
<p>記者們昨天到所參觀，還承難童們的熱誠歡迎，並特備「噓枯吹生」錦旗一面贈送。我們非敢因此而爲牧容所宣傳，可是我們要拿同胞的立塲，人道的立塲，籲請社會人士，伸出你們的手來，救救這些可愛的孩子們，給他們勇氣戴新好好做人，給他們機會學習一技之長！</p>

<h3>火災調查會首次會議　受害人暢所欲言　痛陳消防員不法情形希望澈究　決定步驟三天以內查淸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陜西北路（即西摩路）火災調査委員會，於昨午三時在市府舉行首次會議，到吳市長國楨，市府參事葛克信，參議會代表張迺作，警察局督察長張達，江寗區區長侯雋人，保長蔡國樑，甲長張志文，江蘇監察使署列席人科長張立三，調査專員張權，及受害人鄭敝堅（原住西摩路六六〇弄二七鮮）。會議由吳市長主持，市長致詞稱：西摩路武定路於本月廿二日（舊曆元旦）夜發生大火，對此不幸事件，市府及警察局極感慚愧。對於外界所傳消防人員有失職處，本人與警局宣局長及消防處周處長，均認爲事關全體市民公益，調査及處理必須絕對公開。市府與警局決不粉飾，應予澈査。消防隊應具義勇精神，本人現已傳令消防處，以後每遇火災，允須努力撲救，有功績者可專案請獎，但必須嚴禁任何弊端。此次組織調査委員會之目的，即在於明瞭事實眞相，冀杜絕今後弊端之再生。故凡在塲人員，均應勇於作證。</p>
<p>關於調査委員會之任務，吳市長認爲有下列三項：（一）行政調査，譬如何時起火，何時報警，消防隊何時到達，救火當時情形如何，是否無油無水，機械有無損壞處。（二）勒索情事，此點擬請市參議會代表，江寗區區保甲長及受災居民充分調査與陳訴。（三）打刦情事，如有趁火打刧情事，一經査實，定予嚴辦。</p>
<p>關於調査委員會如何進行，由葛主任委員主持，吳市長特建議數點如下：（一）詢問受災居民。（二）請當塲到達之新聞記者及美軍作證。（三）詢問到塲之消防隊指揮人及隊員。</p>
<p>吳市長末稱：中國必須走向民主之路，對於這件大事，必須公開而鄭重。自明日起盼於三天以內調查淸楚，以憑處理。</p>
<p>鄭載堅述·火災實況</p>
<p>繼由受害人鄭敝堅歷述火災時情形，略謂：起火之晚，本人正與姪子下棋作樂。突聞有人喊隔壁失火，登樓推窗探視，火勢已旺。即囑家人將箱子細軟等搬到樓下。但未幾火勢即吿頓挫，料已無事，復將箱籠等重又搬回樓上。家人等均額手稱慶，不料貼鄰王雲甫寓所突被延及，致再度倉皇奔避。時火勢已熾，終至無法收拾地步。</p>
<p>本人於火勢延燒時，始終在塲，僅見三個消防員曾施救，且態度極爲悠閑。詢以二十九號已遭延燒爲何不救？一消防員即怒聲相對，答曰，水龍無水，你懂什麼？待火勢已這及二九號上下三層時，消防員竟袖手旁觀，並謂：媽的，隨他去吧！</p>
<p>擅取雜物·警察苦笑</p>
<p>鄭氏又謂當時並曾目睹某消防員擅入廿九號內，竊取熱水瓶二隻，往戈登路泰然而去。鄭氏當即拉住在該路口之警察問：救火員搶東西你爲什麼不去抓人？警察僅搖頭苦笑，毫無動作。</p>
<p>質問兩點</p>
<p>鄭氏復提出二點質問：（一）消防員全屬毫無經騐，蓋西摩路之救火龍頭開放後，竟先接上壓水機，致水勢猛烈，皮帶無法接上，結果徒然浪費時間。（二）救火車有雲梯設備，爲何始終未見應用。若當銅匠作起火時，即以水龍分向廿九號上下層猛澆，則保險可吿無事。鄭氏末稱，事關大衆利害，當局必須加以澈査！</p>
<p>市長鼓勵儘量檢舉</p>
<p>當鄭氏詳述其諷歷經過時，吳市長連連點頭稱是，並鼓勵在塲者儘量檢舉。故會中出席者情緒激昂，江寗區區長侯雋人亦憤然稱：若王雲甫無家產，則不致引起此番大禍！我雖不敢咬定消防員有敲詐行爲，但保險箱被打開，及手飾箱失蹤確屬事實！</p>
<p>阻止美兵施救</p>
<p>甲長張志文並報吿，當火勢大熾時，南面之美國兵營曾放出皮帶企圖施救，但爲在塲之消防員所阻，後美兵祗得於營房內將皮帶管子横過二宅洋房再行射水。張並列舉當受難區婦女携雜物逃避時，消防員曾有輕薄調戲行爲。</p>
<p>保長蔡國樑則謂，確知王雲甫宅有日光燈一具，及手電筒一只，某消防員借來用於救火者，結果始終未見歸還。又據王小姐談，渠房內有衣橱一隻，未遭殃及，但事後發現斧痕纍纍，裏面之手飾箱一隻已不翼而飛，箱內有鑽鐲等名貴飾物多件，其價値一時尙無法估訂。</p>
<p>希望市民多予協助</p>
<p>參議會代表張迺作於聽取各方報吿後，發表意見謂：對於本市之消防人員，素來有「救火先講金條」之流言，此項流言，迄今尙未打破。此次事件發生後，吳市肯長親自主持調査，深信必可水落石出，今後消防員紀律若經整飭，弊端當可絕跡。然必須市民予以切實協助，中國人民習性，往往認爲「多一事不如少一事」，將一切付諸命運，致受難者猶不願出而作證。故此番深盼市民能够多予協助。</p>
<p>決定調查步驟</p>
<p>末由葛主任委員報吿調査會任務，及決定調査步驟如下：廿九日上午九時在蔡保長辦公處（小沙渡路三五〇號）集合，出發災區實地調査，製定災區圖案。廿九日下午二時仍在上列地點集合，召集各受火人發表意見，如受災人有不願出席，或由委員會親往訪問之。三十日上午仍繼續上項訪問。三十日下午訪問消防隊。三十一日上午訪問美軍，調査當時情形。委員會並表示歡迎各報記者參加，以示市府一切公開之意。</p>
<p>程監察使密切注意</p>
<p>昨日上午，程監察使，接見警察局兪副局長，聽取關於火案各種報吿，並於十一時，由兪副局長陪同，到武定路察勘火場，在火塲垂詢事主及鄰戶，並由消防處第一科王科長，說明當時施救情形。聞使署方面，正在繼續調査中。</p>

<h3>三檢查官勘察火場　王家衣櫥劈壞　珍飾不翼而飛　救火皮管反被壓於圮墻之下</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地檢處楊守成，沈祖壽，黄達平三檢察官，昨晨九時率領畫記官法警等七人，赴西摩路六六〇弄火災塲勘察，並訪問被災住戶，調査當時消防人員有無凟職情形。首至損失最鉅之王雲甫家，王本人適外出，有一女眷領檢察官至谷處踏勘，並稱首飾箱一隻確已遺失，內藏有小金條鑽戒等物。該首飾箱係藏三樓一衣橱內，事後發現衣櫥已被劈壞，被砍落之橱門上一木塊尙遺留室內，檢察官以此木塊在證實罪行上頗有價値，故即命法警收藏携回。次至永勤橡膠廠査詢，據其中一職員答稱，因廠中備有滅火機，火災時曾使用，頗爲得力，故廠中損害較輕。至於消防人員有否「講斤頭〕等情，彼無從知悉。叧發現一救火用大橡皮管被壓於坍墻下，檢察官認爲此點亦大有研究價値，蓋如消防員努力灌救，當能隨時顧到水管。據當時目睹者向檢察官吿稱，消防員根本未灌救，而將橡皮管任意放置地上，後該處房屋延燒，墻壁坍倒，故橡皮管亦遭埋置。三檢察官至十一時許始歸去，將視案情需要，於今日傳訊有關人員，以備自動檢舉。</p>
<h3>三漢奸案提公訴</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕誣吿楊文道之吿發人曾元，於上海淪陷期間，曾任敵憲兵隊密探，經張灃浦向高檢處吿發，經高檢處提起公訴。昨日高院傳訊吿發人張灃浦，據稱，我在忠義救國軍充任副官處長，曾派弟張森來滬工作，爲曾元吿密，被敵憲兵捕去，備受非刑，終至身死，同時蒙難者尙有情報人員六七人等語。庭諭：本案改期傳證再訊。</p>

<h3>標賣物資涉嫌案　三被告到庭受訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕主席密令澈査之市府接收物資管理處及警局員警福利委員會標賣物資舞弊嫌疑案，昨日下午二時地院再度關庭，被吿潘樹藩，徐靜波，廖公劭各偕辯護律師準時到庭，推事黄先鈺點名過後，首訊潘樹藩，據供；據供：任管處副處長，負責處中例行公事，閱卷後始知有人吿發。至於標賣布疋數目已不復記憶，根據「標賣物資辦法」僅貼公吿，未曾登報，當開標時之監標人員係由警局派來，一切皆呈准上級辦理，有案可稽。庭上傳物管處處長沈士華未到，僅由代理律師呈一狀，稱處中事務本人雖爲處長，實無暇兼顧，所有事務均由副處長督屬辦理云。繼訊徐靜波，供稱：任警局員警福利委員會主任委員，購回棉布擬充實福利委員會基金，當時曾經簽呈局方批准。當由酈鰲奎律師繳呈該簽呈之抄稿。</p>
<p>廖公劭供稱：任警局總務購回棉布係爲公岡利，因當時員警發放米貸金在在需款，標賣購回皆係經錢市長核准，並謂錢市長大槪亦經</p>
<p>主席核准，警局市府均有案可查。徐靜波又供：該批棉布購回後市價突回跌，反在標價之下，故當時員警福利委員會開會有人反對，並不予以承認，如現任新</p>
<h3>上海監獄釋犯忙　發還存款捺留指紋　諄諄曉諭不得再犯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲上海監獄釋放適合大赦條例罪犯之第五日。上海監獄經數日來之粉刷，奐然一新。大門横額「上海監獄」四字漆成金色，二門漆繪藍底白字「明禮義知廉恥負責任守紀律」大字標語，大門屋頂矗立藍白相間花條旗桿，國旗迎風招展，似爲重獲自由人犯慶幸者。門口兩旁鵠立犯人家屬，手提換身衣褲包袱，不時向內張望。監獄內辦公室熱鬧異常，看守所長柏其林親自點詢釋放犯人，先問姓名，籍貫，釋放後向何處去，幷嘵諭嗣後不得再犯，然後捺留指紋，手續完畢後，由叧一法警集合四五犯人，手持出門證，引導犯人步出監獄大門。在監獄內儲有存款者，憑摺隨即發還，有名劉林生者，僅有二百七十元存款，均經如數發給，一絲不茍。昨日共計釋放犯人二十八名，大多爲吸毒竊盜等犯。記者幷訪上海監獄負責人詢及五日來該獄釋放犯人總數，據稱，第一日二百八十一名，第二日六百十二名，第三日二十五名，第四日八十四名，連同昨日二十八名，共計釋出適合大赦條例犯人一千零三十名。成分局長卓淸寳，及前任秘書陳紹英皆曾與會，可以證明。因之該批棉布即陸續發售，結果非唯無利可圖，反有虧蝕。來往款項皆登載公賑可查。黃推事再傳前物管處業務副組長及正組長溫廣鋒道賢模兩證人，詢問標售情形，皆稱當時係奉處長與副處長之命辦理。棉布標價照市價打七五折，由榕茂棉布號標得，至於榕茂老闆及何人介紹等皆稱不知。庭上以該案尙需收集證據，諭改期再審。潘之辯護律師王善祥起立提供意見稱：被吿一切皆係奉命辦理，標賣手續之是否合法亦不以登報與吾爲斷，潘殊光明磊落，故請庭上從速調査證據，以盼早明事實眞相。最後庭上將三被吿賣付三律師，並諭今後開庭，應隨傳隨到，不得規避。</p>
<h3>京滬路局　致力現代化工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京訊區路局現正致力於軍擬現代化計劃，其重心爲擴大車站，加强機廠修理能力，訂購新式車輛及車頭，增加電器號誌等。</p>
<p>路局第一期復舊計劃，於二月底期滿，嗣後即致力現代化工作。唯京滬·滬杭兩路，原擬更換枕木三十餘萬根，因枕木來源困難，目前所更換者，不過一二萬根。</p>

<h3>前法公董局華員儲金　靜待淸理委員會解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前工部局華籍職員爲要求發還養老金及儲養金事，曾向英駐滬領事館請願。但因勝利後本市已有上海市前租界官有產權債務淸理委員會之組織，故此問題乃移由該會處理，惟至今尚獲得未解決。而最近前法公董局華籌職員亦提出同一性質之要求，請發還歷年儲蓄金。</p>
<p>推派代表·申述意見</p>
<p>彼等於日前乘上海市前租界官有產權債務淸理委員會法租界小組開會時，推派徐耀庭，沈渭濱兩代表到會說明情形，申述前法公董局華籍職員共有二·一四九人，現登記要求發還該項儲蓄金者已達二千一百人左右。其中河南，山東籍者甚多，現今流落上海，近况基為困苦。故望此一間題能早得解決。</p>
<p>法方表示·未扣薪水</p>
<p>惟據法方表示：當偽府接收租界時，公董局本擬將儲蓄金發予華籍職員，後因偽府恐發放後，所有職員將辭退，如此則原有組織頓吿瓦解。故請求公董局不發，且此項儲蓄金係由公董局在每年編預算時，假定有百分之十華籍職員退職，將此應發之退職金列入預算，作爲支出之一部份，並非由各職員之薪水中所扣出云。</p>
<p>現淸理委員會飭令前公董局華籍職員代表編造全部人員名册，註明中文姓名住址，應發數目及現今是否仍在警局服務，並擬於審查過去法公董局之賑冊後，再定解決辦法。</p>
<h3>地局謀增進效率　舉行業務檢討會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地政局以復員迄今，已逾一載，爲檢討過去一年工作，以謀增進今後工作效率起見，特定於今明兩日舉行業務檢討會議。</p>

<h3>央行繼續管制下　烚赤益見平穩</h3>
<p>外幣旣無波動　華股大多挫跌</p>
<p>烚赤昨仍由央行管制，惟實銷逢低暢暢，尙有回頭，晨開則破三九〇萬關，央行隨市仍售，盤低至三八五萬光景，而後吿定。十時後，央行以三八七萬之價，配給一九〇〇條，此後漸形回穩，經實力派等買意吿暢之下，午刻步升至三九三萬左右。午後隔日交割，曾微漲至三九六萬，復經央行壓力而回降，低價再見三八七萬，而後者定。結果與前收相彷彿。飾金掛低至四〇萬五，銀元平平，暗拆銀根仍緊，息價在一角八左右。</p>
<p>外幣平庸萬分。美鈔暗盤在六千七至六千九間徘徊，自晨迄午，毫無變化，午刻仍在是價徘徊，與前收相彷彿。港票亦然，結果較前收微降二十元。港匯昨因申電回升，及金鈔影響，退至一三一〇元左右，有成交，印匯一五九〇元，英匯二〇九〇〇元，有行無市。</p>
<p>公債昨成交仍少，過程平庸萬分，成交僅一百萬左右。統丙晨開二一二〇元，即步降至一九六〇元，而後回升至二〇五〇元，最後平盤，結果較前收回跌三百元，甲乙跌四十元，統丁統戊各降二百元。</p>
<p>華股昨多方潰散，成交極稀，不易支持。晨開已低，開後八九號八五號九七號一八六號即有納胃，而吿拉高，二一二號一五六號尙售而有盤頭，惟九一號一五五號一三三號一八八號等有買，永業地產由一三三號掛漲停，遞永紗盤高至八三五元，一五六號八九號二二號九七號二〇七號一再供售，塲外息價仍開高爲一角九分半至二角四，十一時後，復盤旋而下，迫八百元關，二二四號一五二號一五一號趁低有補，曾拉上二十元，二〇七號一八六號二二四號仍賣，始跌落至現永紗七九〇元，遞永紗七九九元價。午收稍盤，結果較前收計永紗，華豐良降，信和，新光，景福各跌半成，美亞降一成，勤興跌一成半弱，冷股景綸，永業漲停外，餘音微挫迄跌一成不等，遞交永紗，華豐微挫，信和，新光跌半成，午後交易更少，散戶有納，金市亦先高繼低，一五六號售出現永紗，一四五號亦賣，遞永紗自八一五元光景，步降至八百元大關，一九八號趁低維持現永紗，一七八號亦有買胃，而吿盤旋，景綸由六八號掛高至漲停，三時後，八九號一五四號等均進，而一六號三五號則進現永紗，臨收時迫八二〇元光景，結果較前收計永紗，新光微挫，美亞，信和，景福，勤興各跌半成，華豐微升，冷股景綸漲停，永業午前漲停，而午後無市，新亞，商務，永公尙穩，餘微降，遞交華豐微升，餘者微挫。</p>
<p>外股昨亦回落，各股過程平庸，結果較前收計怡紗，英聯合跌半成，會德豐，業廣，怡啤跌半成弱，航業，鋼業，紙業跌落甚微。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣委員會　在最近期內成立　於資金方面予商人便利　外傳統購統銷絕對不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠方面消息，輸出推廣委員會，將在最近期內成立，下月初可望有正式消息發表。該會將在中國銀行大厦內設立執行委員會，聞將由貝祖貽任主任委員，並聘請有關各業專家担任顧問，該會成立宗旨，係在獎勵輸出，擬於資金與船舶運輸方面，儘量予出口商人以便利，並將討論出口津貼辦法，俾我國出口事業，在政府獎勵之下，積極發展。外界所傳統購統銷之說，絕對不確。</p>
<p>並悉輸入管理委員會，爲配合獎勵輸出起見，對於若干種與鹼出有關之貨品，如花邊，漂白粉等，係爲我國輸出品繡貨與豬鬃漂白之用，此項貨品，將列入不限額進口之例云。</p>
<h3>米價轉平油市暗降</h3>
<p>昨滬南閘北到源各糧，共計三千石左右，西貢米供應仍續，南北市塲共計成交三百三十包。粳秈高貨來源雖稀，但店方因價高，門售出手困難，進胃見懈。中央信託局由海列輪運抵泰國米八萬六千包，正在上卸之中，仍交社會局配配售，是以人心虛軟，粳秈米暗中回跌一二千元，形勢已轉平疲。油市亦因植物油廠正在配油之中，消化頓形淸閒，塲外市價，暴跌一萬餘元，市塲仍少正式成交。黄豆各消紛起，高而愈固，步升五六百至千元，油廠本街汕頭內地互相購納，後形尙挺。豆餅台灣汕頭去化蟬聯，略升二一百元。麩皮漲定，麵粉洋粉供源繼續，統粉供給仍續，市勢站立，惟本粉因內地高昂，續升一二千元，苞米到消兩稀，價無榮辱，赤豆平庸，彔豆亦無軒輊，生仁則廣帮依然暢辦，續見高翔，再漲三四千元，芝蔴南洋活絡，實消甚旺，步挺二三千元，豇豆南洋汕頭收吸，獨漲六七千元。</p>
<h3>社局拋售西貢米　達一萬餘包</h3>
<p>本市食米，自春節後因四鄕來源較减，米蠧從中作祟，米價即見上漲，昨日白米黑市價已喊八萬元大關，社會局爲抑平米價起見，昨在南北兩米市塲拋出之西貢米，達一萬餘包之多，價格仍爲六萬三千元，門售限價爲七萬元，據悉社局拋出之西貢米，米質較劣，且滬地市民大多有喜食白米之習慣，此爲造成白米上漲之叧一原因云。</p>
<h3>輸入許可證　發出一萬六千份</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行外匯審核處消息：該處辦理附表之各項輸入申請許可事宜，對去年十一月十七日以前所訂購之貨，業已處理達百分之九十八以上。所發出之許可證，共計在一萬六千份左右。至該日以後所訂購之貨，該處亦已接到申請書約三千份，惟以審核費時，故核發許可證者，尙佔少數。</p>
<h3>中信局購蠶絲　川絲源源到滬</h3>
<p>中信局自本月廿一日收購D級秋絲及叧烘春蠶秋絲以來，截至前日止，由貸款總管處解送者計秋絲六三五担，另烘蠶絲二三五担，總計八百七十祖，已達秋絲總額半數以上。昨日由生絲檢騐所交貸款總管處經騐合格之生絲械騐單計一百担，不日即可解往中信局。按前預計於一個月內收竣者，若照此情形順利收解，恐僅二週，即可完畢。</p>
<p>又四川去年所產春秋生絲，業已源源運滬，本月份運到者共計一百五十餘祖，聞尙有三四百祖亦在途中，均將由中信局收買，惟收買價較江浙皖三省所產之生絲爲低，因其生產成本較廉，聞正由當局決定中。</p>
<h3>央行滙兌課改稱外滙課</h3>

<h3>紐約市況調查　我國出口貨物　在美國之需要與價格</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕聯合社近在紐約調査中國出口貨之需要及價格，結果如下：</p>
<p>羊皮——羊皮市况稍後當可安定，惟目前殊極不應。市價已見跌落，但賣方索價與美國物價趨勢比較</p>
<p>兎皮——情形大體與全皮相同，惟進口數額較多。</p>
<p>羽毛（製被褥用之鴨毛）——市况競爭頗烈，價値暴落，一部份因被褥套布太少，一部份因綜合製品競爭者多。進口貨之品質使買主望而却步，數量又多寡無定。花色貨情形相同，戰前係由中國輸入，但其需要隨婦女所喜式樣而變動。</p>
<p>大黄——價格被投機操縱，對於銷費量所開之價爲每鎊迎運費美金一元四角至一元四角半，市價將趨向下游。</p>
<p>麝香——受人造麝香之競爭日烈，惟乾貨每兩有出價至美金八十五元者，由飛機運美，但須看貨成交。中國方面開價，近日最低曾至每兩七十八元，包括海運費或在中國航空站交貨。</p>
<p>桐油標準出品在美國之售價，每磅自美金三角八分三七五至三角九分半，惟中國方面每磅索價四角。美商以運費及保險費高昂，照此價格無意輸入。</p>
<p>猪鬃——政府剩餘貨物已於一月六日處分，美商希望能以較低價格買進，目前無意向國外輸人。</p>
<p>蜂蠟——目前祗有粗貨可以銷售，四處來源之價格各不相同，自一每磅四角八分到五角四分紐約交貨，至每磅五角到五角三分菲洲口岸交貨不等，據某大買主稱，將俟蜂蠟價格回至每磅二三角之平常水準，再行採辦。</p>
<p>五倍十、五倍子被投機家抬價，戰後在紐約普通貨每磅曾高至四角六分，近巳回落至平均每磅兩角，而運費每噸需四十元，保險費每百元需一元零三分，外加其他費用，由華商視之，此價自屬太低。</p>
<p>生絲——中國輪美生絲，與日絲相較，數量甚微，價格亦受官價限制。</p>
<h3>大批肥料運華</h3>
<p>行總處理農漁物資，向與農林部合作辦理，去年聯總運到之農漁物資，約達十萬噸，其中以肥料佔大半，漁業器材次之，惟聯總所運來之肥料，逐有減少，每使該署無法分配，各地所需之肥料均甚緊急，聯總曾聯電華府，請其早日如數撥運，據悉本年春季，聯總可有三千噸肥料運載來華，該署現對農墾機械之利用等均訂有詳細計劃，今年將儘力推行，俾使各地農田可以增產云。</p>

<h3>廠商紛請解僱工人　社局苦乏對策</h3>
<p>在工商業不景氣之下，各工廠度過年關，但春節後若干工廠迄未開工，紛請社會局准予解僱工人，聞社會局於兩日內收到各廠商解僱工人之申請呈文達十餘件，社會局對此問題極爲重視，正在籌商對策中云。</p>
<h3>來貨清稀賣戶觀望　焦作塊新盤高</h3>
<p>煤市白煤焦作塊，因來貨淸稀，賣戶觀望，故紅盤遲遲未做出，昨開八十四萬元高價，較前市漲達五六萬元之巨，後又高至八十六萬元，求者甚殷。其他白煤鴻基塊等，均承前趨勢，並無上落，烟煤開平塊屑，交易步暢，市價平穩，煤球大小廠廠盤每噸均漲二萬元，大廠卅八萬元自車，小廠卅六萬元自車云。</p>

<h3>明年世界運動會　倫敦積極籌務中　五千名選手食宿成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報編譯室譯路透社倫敦電〕下屆奧林匹克世界運動會，將於一九四八年在倫敦舉行，自七月廿九日起至八月十四日止。世運籌備委員會頃發表正式佈吿，初次宣佈籌備詳情，略稱：屆時將有廿五國（德日兩國未曾邀請）著名選手的五千人參加競賽。此大批選手之住宿問題，必須政府協助，方能圓滿解決，預料將建設一奧林匹克新村，專供選手居住，地點政府尙未決定。組織工作現已開始。自溫布萊車站至運動塲間，現正鋪築新路，特種更衣室，淋浴及浸浴設備，亦在建築中。此外並擬建築一露天游泳池，及運動員特種跑道。</p>
<p>火炬接力　第二個困難問題爲燃點奧林匹克火炬，此項火炬在運動會舉行期間，無論風雨陰晴，必須繼續燃點，並在白畫可以望見，至閉幕日始行熄滅。該火炬將在希臘奧林帕斯山上用巨型放大鏡，攝取日光燃點，然後由賽跑，脚踏車駕駛及騎馬各項運動選手，携帶該火炬接力賽跑，越過歐洲大陸，最後置於運動塲內，作爲開幕典禮之點綴。</p>
<p>建築新村　但最難於處置之問題，當爲五千運動員及職員之膳宿問題。奧林匹克新村之建設，似已不成問題，但其地點在何處，則尙不可知。此項地點之選擇，必須以運動會閉幕以後，所有房屋可供民用或軍用爲標準。且新村地點，必須距離溫布萊車站及運動塲愈近愈佳。曾有人建議美國及其他各國可以大型郵船載送選手至倫敦，碇泊於泰晤士河上，使彼等開會期間，住宿於船上。一九二八年世運會在阿姆斯德丹舉行時，美國曾採取此項辦法，惟該處船塢距離運動塲較近，而倫敦船塢距離溫布萊則較遠。</p>
<p>飛機運送　聞美國現正考慮於比賽時用飛機分批載送各項運動之選手，如此則選手之膳食及住宿問題，均可迎刃而解，此項辦法對於不能長時期離開職務之業餘運動家，允感便利，但可能得到假期之選手則反對此項辦法。最後，有一消息爲全世界長跑家所不願聞者，即去年在挪威京城奧斯羅獲得歐洲一萬米賽跑錦標之英國長跑健將伍特遜重申其不願參加國際比賽決意。</p>
<p>競賽節目　〔英國新聞處倫敦廿八日電〕明年將於英國舉行之世界運動會，刻已開始籌備，英政府爲招待世界各國五千名運動健將起見，已成立一委員會，討論此五千名選手之居住問題，一般預料此乃籌備人所遭問題中之最大者。運動節目將包括馬術，划船，劍術，射撃，拳術，游泳，足球，籃球，舉重等十七項，藝術比賽如文學，彫刻，音樂，建築，繪畫，木刻之類，亦將循例形成運動會節目中之一部分。政院重新調整</p>

<h3>美國對華政策　一場雄辯！</h3>
<p>— 秋雁寄紐約</p>
<p>十四日航訊</p>
<p>這是去年八月二十日的一次言論，似乎已經過時。但是雙方的意見儘管不同，到今天依然代表了不少的美國人。參加者的風度，也很令我們欽佩。我們中國今天旣然要向着民主的方向走，自然不可不學他們的辯論方式。</p>
<p>發起者：美國空中論壇（無綫電廣播機構）</p>
<p>辯論題目：我們對中國應該怎樣？</p>
<p>辯論人：福爾曼，（Harrison　Forman）著作家兼探險家。</p>
<p>坎納德博士（Dr.J.Spencer　Kennard）前駐華傳敎士。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士，（FredaUtley）著作家。</p>
<p>考爾伯格博士（Dr.　Alfred　Kohlberg）美華政策協會會員。</p>
<p>主席：雷博士，（Dr.Josrph　M.　Ray）瑪麗蘭大學政府及政治糸主任。</p>
<p>報吿員—我們的對華政策是否走向世界和平？我們應否抽身而退？我們應否參加某一方？我們對中國應該怎樣？</p>
<p>這一個重大的問題，今天又在你們的美國空中論壇上討論了，（鼓掌）。</p>
<p>太太們，先生們，晚安！從你們的首都曉嵐飯店（The　Shoreham　Hotel），互助廣播公司很驕傲地向你們介紹美國的無錢電廣播服務的前輩，十八年前就已由格蘭尼克先生創辦了的美國空中論壇，格蘭尼克先生是檢察官兼伸裁官。美國空中論壇，每週都把重要的問題提出來，請具有影響決策的力量的人舉行辯論。</p>
<p>今天格蘭尼克先生因似期外出，我們特請一位來賓作爲主席，瑪麗蘭大學政府及政洽糸主任雷博士。</p>
<p>雷主席—晚安！</p>
<p>現在巴黎的口舌之爭十分激烈，而亞洲的槍彈之爭也依然繼續進行。中國的血浸之土，沒有乾燥的機會。中國人差不多已經有十年不曾見到和平。今天，並無一個外敵使全中國的人一致對外，而是內戰把中國撕開。</p>
<p>中國的糾紛的基礎是國民政府與共產黨之間的長期仇殺。今天此項仇殺似乎離開或以解決的程度最遠。我們的駐華代表馬歇爾，據報在上星期曾經說過他已經放棄短期解決的希望。　今天早晨，延安的共產黨首腦部，命令全體動負，對國民政府進行全面內戰。他們說，這一個決定是爲了摧毁蔣介石元帥的攻勢。</p>
<p>我們的對華政策，據杜魯門總統派遣馬歇爾將軍時的聲明，是川一切可能方法帮助中國復興成爲一個統一而民主的民族，足以担負她在太平洋及作爲國際家庭之一員的責任。關於這一個政策的說明了的目的，各方並無爭論。但是美國輿論界中熟悉情形的份子，就如何達到此項目的一層，却有很大的爭執。</p>
<p>有一羣人以爲我們的政策僅使增加了蔣介石無帥的軍隊與共產黨　衝突。他們　國務部在進行此項政策之時把他們所稱爲一個法西斯蒂的派系的武力建樹起來，並且在事實上他們認爲共產黨是改革家。</p>
<p>他們要求我們中止此項政策，應該援助中國的人民，不要援助這一個他們認爲不肯給人民以起碼的民主觀念的派系。</p>
<p>另一羣人態度同樣堅決，而且對於中國的情形同樣熟悉，主張我們要繼續支持國民政府，作爲對於俄國支配該國的一個最大的堡壘。他們的依據是我們傳統的門戶開放政策。他們說，倘若共產黨得勢，這一個政策便要付諸東流了。</p>
<p>美國的整個對太平洋外交政策發生問題了。是在太平洋，戰爭的種子曾經埋下。我們現在不可走錯路，以免未來再有糾紛。</p>
<p>今天晚上，美國空中論壇繼續牠的關於國際問題的重大討論，牠請來了四位具有親身經歷的經騐，懂得中國問題的權威。從他們四位的不同意見之中，我們相信你們可以獲得足够的事實以形成你們自己的意見。</p>
<p>現在，他們在此地。第一，烏特麗女士，做過不少關於中國的書籍的名作家。烏特麗女士！請你談談罷！</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—中國今天的情形有很多地方與二次大戰以前的西班牙相像。我想，我們應該給我們的盟友，合法的中國政府，以完全而有效的支持，以抵禦紅色的法西斯蒂暗探，他們正在設法毀滅中國的獨立與一切可以發展爲民主國家的希望，以便把中國變成俄羅斯獨裁下的一個附庸。我們應該中止强迫中國的政府興莫斯科的暗探，即中國共產黨共享政權，他們的目的是要保持中國於分裂，無力而貧困的狀態之中，只要中國政府對美國友好一天。</p>
<p>我們在歡洲所受到的敎訓應該叫我們當心，不要再受同樣的欺騙，再上同樣的當，我們已經賣了米卡勞非基與波蘭人，讓俄羅斯人在全歐洲嘲笑大西洋憲章。</p>
<p>反，我們的全副力量該用來　　中國的眞正自由份子之手。當我們假定共產黨是民主份子之轉，我們恰好說了反面。自然，自從我們把赤色恐怖與極權獨裁認爲可以和民主一詞相混以後，中國內部的反動份子也抬了頭。</p>
<p>雷主席—謝謝你，烏特麗女士。其次，福兒曼，著作家兼探險家。福爾曼先生！</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—雷博士，我相信在中國政治的一團糟之中，誰是誰非已經無庸討論。美國軍隊之繼續留駐中國，違反成百萬的中國人之願望（不管他們在政治上是紅是白是藍），只能解釋爲一種明明白白，不折不扣的我國干涉他國內政的打算。</p>
<p>而且將武裝與軍事交通工具給這一個中國的派系去反對那一個派系，不僅是恰好與我們的調停使命背道而馳的假冒爲善的行動，而且無論用怎樣的尺度來衡量都是在基本上的不道德。</p>
<p>倘若把那些武器給中國共產黨，我也要認爲同樣地不道德。因爲說到最後，你不能解說，把槍桿遞到這一個中國人之手讓他去殺他的中國同胞，不管這兩人於互相爭吵之中誰是誰非。</p>
<p>讓我們把中國人還給中國人。</p>
<p>雷主席—謝謝你，福爾曼先生。其次，考爾伯格先生，美華政策協會會員。考爾伯格先生！</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—根本，雷博士，中國的情形極其簡單。德國是第一個，中國是第二個，在俄羅其征服世界的程序之上。征服德國，是爲了牠的工業；征服中國是爲了她的人力。中國共產黨，正如任何一地的共產黨一樣，是莫斯科約有訓練的工具。美國今日而對的問題，是應否帮助俄羅斯征服中國，或堅守美國的傳統外交政策，即門戶開放與中國之獨立及領土完整。</p>
<p>雷主席—謝謝你，考爾伯格先生。現在，坎納德博士，曾經到過中國的傳敎士。坎納德博士！</p>
<p>坎納德博士—讓我們承認俄國人相信他們自己的生活方式好，正如英美的人相信英美的生活方式好，而問題是如何傳佈那種特殊的哲學。我相信我們現今所用的保持美國聲譽的方法很壞。我們現今正在武裝法西斯蒂的派系，牠們將來會反過來對美國不利。强迫中國人走入共產之途，使得中國人民除此以外，別無避免外國（美國）軍事支配之路，是很壞的。中止正常的經濟活動（貿易），而指定中國人必須有怎樣的一個政府形式，使得內戰永久不停，對於美國也是很壞的。我們需要那些快樂的五萬萬顧主。在亞洲擴展一種戰爭，如我們今日所做，予頑强的派糸以鼓勵，對於美國是很壞的。這一個戰爭可能變成世界性的。第三次世界大戰已經開始了！</p>
<h3>中國背後有俄國　俄國企圖把美國摔出去</h3>
<p>雷主席—謝謝你們，烏特麗女士與三位先生。現在問題弄淸楚了，雙方的立塲也明白了。</p>
<p>爲了開始討論，福爾曼先生，你以爲我們應該退出中國嗎？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—雷博士，堅決的一個「是」字。把俄羅斯牽涉到中國的問題來，等於在畫面上加一條紅鈎（拖進來一條紅魚）。除非我們願意用五萬的無辜的中國人之血沾汚我們的手，他們將要而且已經死在美國製造的槍彈與炸彈之下，否則讓我們退出中國，而且快些！</p>
<p>雷主席—烏特麗女士！</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我想向對方兩位，尤其是福爾曼先生，發一個問題，因爲他們曾經談到加强法西斯蒂派糸的軍事力量。在我們繼續討論以前，我想應該先弄淸楚他們所謂法西斯蒂是指的什麼。所以我想問福爾曼先生是否同意愛崙堡先生（Mr.　Ehrenberg）的定義：凡是反對共產主義俄羅斯的都是法西斯蒂。倘若如此，你是否以爲凡是反對俄羅斯侵略或支配的中國人及美國人，便是法西斯蒂？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—烏特麗女士，愛崙堡先生和你關於法西斯蒂的定義，令我想起今日美國流行的關於共產黨的定義？今天，凡是一個與你意見　不同的人便是共產黨。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我問你是否同意愛崙堡先生的定義。我不曾說我與她一致。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我和愛崙堡先生不一致，和你也不一致。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—你可否說出你對於法西斯蒂的定義。我指當你把這個名詞用到中國的時候。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—一個法西斯蒂，便是不給人民以民主生活方式的人。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—那末，中國共產黨也是法西斯蒂，因爲他們追隨俄羅斯，而俄羅斯是完全不給人民以民主生活方式的。</p>
<p>福爾受先生—我同意一半。中國共產黨依照我的定義，也許是局部的法西斯蒂，但是我不同意你所說的他們與俄羅斯有任何關係。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—雷博士，在我看來，我們似乎已經談到問題的核心了。福爾曼先生以爲中國共產黨與俄羅斯毫無關係。然而他們從一九二一年到一九四三年共產國際表面解散時。曾經做了共產國際的會員，他們不能做會員如此之久，除非極有紀律，極知服從。</p>
<p>而且，我願意向福爾曼先生宣讀，中國共產黨的老板或獨裁者，倘若你願意這樣稱呼，也就是福爾曼先生心目中的英雄，毛澤東，自己所說的話：「全世界今天期待共產主義做他們的救星，中國也是如此。社會主義的蘇聯與帝國主義的英美之間衝突，正在一步逼緊一步。中國倘若不站在這一邊，必須站在那一邊。」</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—考爾伯裕先生，我個人却向毛澤東先生鼓掌，他如此坦白的說出自己的意見。但是你所宣讀的是毛澤東先生前些時說過的話，美國很少人知道蔣介石氏兩年前在「中國之命運」裏說些什麼，凡是讀過那本書的人都說這是中國所出版的最排外的一本著作。這一本「中國之命運」經過蔣氏的批准，是成百萬的中國人必讀之書，正如希特勒的「我的奮鬥」之在德國。但是——</p>
<p>烏特麗女士（插入）—請你注意，福爾曼先生！</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—但是在美國，他們不許人讀。請你原諒我一會兒。讓我說完這個，如何？此地，在美國京城國務部，有一本英文的「中國之命運」譯本，但是上面標明「極機密」。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我想說的是，我們已經離開本題。自然，像中國這樣一百年來遭遇此去彼來的列强侵略之國家，自然免不了某種限度以內的排外思想。今日的問題是，倘若說成百萬的中國人要美國人退出中國，如你們二位所說，實在完全是錯誤的。我在中國所得的經騐，恰好與此相反。你們也許聽到，最先到滿洲的美國新聞記者爲當地居民所歡迎，拍他們的肩章，求他們救出自己於俄國人及共產黨之手。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我可否給你看一張照片，烏特麗女士，這是關於上海的十萬學生向美國在上海的軍隊示威，要求他們退出中國。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—你可以做任何一件事。</p>
<p>坎納德博士（插入）—我可以加一句，即使在我的學校，華西大學，爲了叫學生向俄羅斯示威，校長必須先向願意參加的人，允許三十天的假期。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—福爾曼先生，你吿訴了我，上海曾經有十萬人民示威反對政府。請問在什麼別的地方……</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我不曾說他們反對政府，我是說他們反對美軍留駐中國。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—是的，也反對政府。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我不曾說他們反對政府，考爾伯格先生。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—請問在中國以外，有那一個法西斯蒂國家曾經有過十萬人民示威，反對政府所行的政策？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—那是一個奇怪的論辯方式，考爾伯格先生，你在曲解。我所說的是中國人不要美軍駐在中國，你不能曲解爲在蔣介石氏的政府之中有民主。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—你是否曾經贊同放棄對日戰爭？因爲汪精衛代表了不少你所說的那些主張「讓中國人管中國自已的事」的人。我們爲什麼要和日本作戰？你是否願意讓中國人歸日本的傀儡統治？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—請你說明白，我們今天在中國還要和誰作戰？</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—正如我所解釋過的，我們都很完全知道背後有俄羅斯。俄羅斯是在試行摔出美國，把中國的門戶關起，使得中國成爲牠的極權帝國的一部份。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我同意你的話，情形正如在西班牙一樣；所不幸的，是我們代替了希特勒與羅索里尼進行武裝干涉。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我的老天！我們曾否進到滿洲加以掠奪？是我們從滿洲搬走機器？是我們做的那些事嗎？我說錯了沒有？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—你是否願意把俄國人的搶掠與美國人的凶殺相比？美國海軍正在殺中國人。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—請你注意！你曾否贊成把軍火租借給俄羅斯？牠現在不僅用這些軍火對付自己的人民，而且對付我們昨日的盟友！</p>
<p>雷主席—請等候一下。讓我們把坎納德博士引進此地的程序來，讓他答覆一個指給他的問題。你是否相信門戶開放與領土完整的原則仍應作爲今後美國對華外交政策的基礎？</p>
<p>坎納德博士—我最確定相信門戶開放是我們在中國應行的政策。不過，我現在看到我們正在強迫中國人實行我們所選定的一種政府與一種經濟制度，事實上，結果是要關閉這個門戶。在和平時代與正常的門戶開放政策之下可以作為美國顧客的五萬萬人，今天被逼得快要抵制美貨，而過去的門戶開放政策將不再存在。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—坎納德博士，你該把做買賣的事情留給我談。這是我的一行啊。你的一行，是宗敎。我可否建議我們不必太懊惱於五萬萬顧主的問題。我們等到鐵幕代替了開放之門，正如已經被共產黨實現於華北及東北的情形，那時候便無庸再懊惱於顧主了。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—考爾伯格先生，所難辦的是我們今天那些身藏手槍的商人，他們定要拿着槍桿逼着中國人做生意，這種流氓手段很容易引起暴動，世界性的暴動，許多無辜的旁觀人民將要被原子彈炸死於克庫克，敖德薩，科凡屈與馬賽。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我生平從來不曾見過如此的是非倒置，用武力强迫人家買東西！中國人無論貧富，於對日作戰八年以後，十分迫切地需要貨物和做買賣，而共產黨用毁壞鐵路的方法來阻止買賣。問題完全是他們買不起所迫切需要的美國貨。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—我根本不能同意，烏特麗女士。是我們在保持中國於混亂狀態之中，因爲倘要在今天中國實現和平，問題是准否中國若干村莊與城市之中僅有的形似民主的東西由中國人自己作主繼續維持？在共產黨與中央政府之間，所爭執的僅有一個問題，即若干如我們美國已經選了縣長與地方官的地城，准否繼續於民主的形式之下存在？</p>
<h3>烏特麗女士挑戰　辯明民主化的眞正道路</h3>
<p>烏特麗女士—你叫牠民主嗎？在只許一黨存在的地方，如中國共產黨所控制下的地城？—只有一個黨，一種報紙，一個無綫電廣播，只有共產黨！</p>
<p>坎納轉博士—請你原諒，我從一切的調査中知道，而且福爾曼先生可以作證。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我也到過那裏。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—在每一處共產黨所控制的地方，我總是就這一點調査了又調査。我又到過上海…</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—我向你挑戰，要求你說出在共產黨地域以內有任何一種共產黨以外的報紙，共產黨以外的無綫電。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—問匙是，當全村的人多數表決了要辦的一種報紙或一個無綫電廣播，這報紙與無綫電是否還可以稱爲共產黨的？</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—請你注意，坎納德博土。我在俄羅斯住過，我懂得這個。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—中國與俄羅斯不同。我不曉得俄羅斯的事。但是我知道在中國這些地域（共區），他們是有民主的。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—又是紅魚來了！</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—這不是紅魚。</p>
<p>雷主席—我們是要談在中國問題是否眞是共產主義？</p>
<p>烏特麗女士，此地有一個請你答覆的問題。倘若共產主義是眞正的問題，爲什麼中央政府要取締民主同盟或自由主義份子，甚至那些反對獨裁的實業家？</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—第一，我不同意如此的說法。民主同盟是追隨共產黨路綫的一小羣不滿意現實的智識份子。比牠大得多而重要得多的各政黨是獨立的，例如靑年黨在某些地方是反對政府的，但在反對共產黨一點上却和政府一致。說政府取締民主同盟等等，這是不確的。在中國的首都，有一半的報紙是反對政府的，其餘的一半報紙，有一半的時候也反對政府。在中國共產黨所控制的地域，你找不到任何一個人被允許說一句反對政府的話！</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—你說得對，鳥特麗女士，他們用不着取締那些與蔣介石氏意見不合的共產主義自由份子，—他們只要施行暗殺。讀你的報紙罷！</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—這是否等於說美國也沒有民主，因爲有人「就地解決」（Lynch）犯罪的黑人。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—這不是「就地解決」幾個黑人的問題。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—那並沒有阻止了美國民主的進展。我並不是說中國已經是一個民主國家。我是說，中國在蔣介石氏之下想做一個民主國家。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—中國在蔣介石氏的報個派系之下，不能成爲一個民主國家，因為那些派系是由於地主的結合，將要自動地被解決的。</p>
<p>鳥特麗女士（插入）—你贊成解決地主嗎？</p>
<p>坎納德博士—我不贊成解決任何人。</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—坎納德博士，我不懂得你有什麼意思要設法叫此地的聽衆相信任何共產黨地域有民主。在一年前，你也許可以辦到。在今天，要叫聽衆相信這句話，你的工作很難做了。</p>
<p>雷主席—此地有一個與這一點有關的問題，是對你而發的。爲個麼所有在美國的中國學生只許習科學的課程？</p>
<p>考爾伯格先生—事實並非如此。我認得很多中國學生所學的是文學與社會科學（各種自由藝術（Liberai　arts）。那個問題的說法是錯誤的。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—學文學與社會科學的太多了。他們需要習科學來建設國家。這是唯一的合理辦法。他們的錢很少，他們很需要工程師及其一類的人，還有醫生，比需要律師更加迫切。</p>
<p>坎納德博士—他們需要各種的人。但是你完全知道，烏特麗女士，中國學生在未來美國以前要先被仔細檢査，是否與陳立夫—及其派系的思想方式相合。他們來了以後，他們的課程也被密切監視。在我們的哥倫比亞小山（哥倫比亞大學所在地）有成百的偵探散佈在學生之中。</p>
<p>烏特麗女士—你應該先到一個共產黨國家去，體騐眞正的味道，坎納德博士，嘗一點暴政的滋味！</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—我恰好有關於這個問題的東西。在我的前面，有一份中國敎育部公文的英文譯本，關於管理留美學生的，第十四條……</p>
<p>考爾柏格先生（插入）—什麽時候的？</p>
<p>福爾曼先生—一九四三年十一月十四日。第十四條說，「自費留學生在留美期間，應該接受大使館督學處關於其思想與行動之指導與管制。」</p>
<p>考爾柏格先生—我很想談談中國的這些「反動份子與法西斯蒂份子。」我認得他們。其中有兩個著名的，常常被你們那一邊的人提起的，何應欽將軍與趙霖將軍（？）。他們都是我的朋友，我同他們交涉過。</p>
<p>雷主席—我很抱歉，考爾柏格先生，時間已經到了。倘若我們能停一下，來總括一下今天晚上的論斷。福爾曼先生，你可否總括一下你這方面的意見？</p>
<p>福爾受先生—雷博士，我想我們重要的事是決定什麽是中國當前的問題。美國的「仇俄」人士花的氣力太多。我並不替俄國人解釋，但是我仍舊堅持，不該把紅魚拖進中國的畫面來。問題是，我們該不該留在中國？</p>
<p>昨天「紐約時報」有一個電報，今天上午「紐約時報」又有一個電報，說一個紐約時報記者訪問駐華的美國海軍，據答他們自己不知道留在中國幹什麼，他們很想離開中國。我把牠剪下來了，標題是「海軍茫然於他們在中國的工作。很多人據說同情共黨。」本文說：「海軍向人表示，他們對現今國民黨政府及其機構失望，而最令人注意的是（這對我很重要）儘管他們在中國執行任務之時常要受到攻擊，侮辱，綁票，甚至有性命的危險，多數的美國海軍暗中同情共產黨所遭遇的危機。（海軍當然不是共產黨）他們認爲今天的情形不能更壞了」。</p>
<p>雷主席—我很抱歉。你的時間過了，福爾曼先生。烏特麗女士，你可否總括一下你這方面的意見？</p>
<p>鳥特麗女士—我想對方的論斷多半是集中到中國政府是否民主的問題。我從來沒有說過牠民主，我現在也不認爲牠已經民主，但是我堅持這是中國唯一可以達到民主的政府。倘若專談牠怎樣不完全民主的問題，我認爲是超出範圍。沒有一個遭遇過像中國近年來所遭遇的國家能够立即民主。</p>
<p>福爾曼先生常常談到我們　到桌面上的紅魚。爲了總括我們這一方面的觀點，我敢說我們相信紅魚已經在那裏了，很大而且發臭！</p>
<p>我願意答覆這個海軍問題。因爲幾個月前，我還在華北的美軍地域，而且回來渡過太平洋是坐的美軍飛機。我的經騐與那位記者的完全不同。差不多每一個和我談過話的海軍官兵都說：「你以爲我們應該留在此地嗎？很顯然，俄羅斯要幹美國。」</p>
<p>他們知道得很淸楚。他們聽國僅到延安的共產黨廣播說，美與日本兩帝國主義所「不」同的，在於美國的一個力量較强而外表較爲文明。海軍官兵，我知道他們，我在華北兩個月，到處旅行，都和他們在一塊，他們是絕對地憤恨俄羅斯的所作所爲。他們把情形知道得很淸楚，在中國共產黨的背後是俄羅斯。</p>
<p>主要的一點，我認爲還不曾討論得充份，實際上還沒有談到，就是倘若美國抽出對於牠的盟友中國政府的支持，情形將要變化得怎樣？對方常常躱開這一點，他們旣不解釋，也不承認。倘若是把中國還給中國人，我絕對和他們一致。那是再好沒有。但是據我們在歐洲所得的經騐，這就是把中國交給俄羅斯與牠的傀儡「中國共產黨！」</p>
<p>雷主席——我很抱歉，我們的時間到了。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>你們所聽到的是美國空中論壇，關於『我們對中國應該怎樣』的一塲辯論。講演的人是福爾曼先生，著作家兼探險隊長，坎納德博士，前駐華傳敎士；烏特麗女士，做過不少關於中國的書籍（指「日本之泥足』等等——編者註）之名作家；考爾柏格先生，美批評華政策協會會員。你們倘若或來信，我們十分歡迎。這位是你們的報吿員，貝次先生（Carl　Bates）。</p>
<p>報吿員——謝謝你，雷博士！</p>

<h3>義大利法西斯　捲·土·重·來　賈尼尼：墨索里尼第二？</h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯自This　Week雜誌</p>
<p>在今日的義大利國內，有一位肥碩赤髮的前法西斯黨員，正懷着極大的廚心，積極組織自己的政黨，準備接受義大利政府。這人便是主筆　評論家的賈尼尼。他整潔地穿着短襯衫和運動短衣，戴着單眼鏡，腰際佩着一枝自動手槍，走起路來大模大樣地活像一位德國陸軍少校。</p>
<p>不久以前賈尼尼曾接見美國合衆通訊社記者，指責第二次世界大戰的發生，羅斯福應負其責。最近傳說有人企圖加害於他，當另一位記者問他對此作何感想時，他拍拍身邊的手槍說：「我有這傢伙做保鑣呢！」</p>
<p>義大利的深謀遠慮的政論家亞爾法羅曾經對筆者說：「儘管人們對着蘇聯有所疑懼，共產主義不會立刻在義大利佔有優勢。今日義大利的眞正危機是一種新典的法西斯主義。」最近的事實已證明他的說話沒有錯誤。一個新興的法西斯黨正在擴張着，不久也許就會獨攬大權的。</p>
<p>共黨威信失墮</p>
<p>去年四月某夜，四個人闖入米蘭附近的墓地，把墨索里尼的屍身盜了去，臨行時還留下一封信，上面寫着：「元首又和我們在一起了。不久躺在棺材裏面的元首就要在義大利的馬路上遊行了…………」信末具名「民主法西斯黨」。</p>
<p>現在這幾個盜屍賊已經鎯鐺入獄了；但是最近在戈里齊亞，羣衆高呼着「元首！」，企圖衝散反法西斯示威遊行隊伍。這新興的法西斯黨並非在地下工作，却是公開活動着。</p>
<p>義大利的共產黨本來不受打擊的。但是，當史達林支持狄托要求義大利人所不肯割愛的特港時，他把義大利共產黨的臺柱拆毀了。共產黨的威信因此失墜，結果在共和制憲議會選舉時二千八百萬票中，僅獲得四百廿八萬四千票，不到全部票數的百分之二十。社會黨獲得三十八萬七千餘票。但是賈尼尼所領導的新法西斯黨，即「平民陣綫黨」竟一嗚驚人，在制憲議會中獲得一百十九萬八千票，三十席之多，比較墨索里尼在一九二二年進軍羅馬以前的末次選舉所得票數，僅少五票。</p>
<p>義大利的新法西斯黨團遍布全國各地，而以賈尼尼的黨派勢力最大，裏面夾雜着許多墨索里尼的老法西斯黨負，總數約二百萬人。一九四五年曾任義大利首相的遊擊隊領袖派里敎授批評他們「不是一個政黨，只是烏合之衆而已。他們是毫無組織的一羣不滿政府者，很可能是另一極權政體的煽動者。」</p>
<p>他們的出發點是賈尼尼主編的「平民」週報。該報在羅馬出版，每期平均銷數五十萬份，有時達八十萬份，是義大利銷路最大的報紙。該報滿幅充溢着誹謗謾罵的文字，對政府，聯合國和共產黨極盡惡意攻擊之能事。</p>
<p>生平最恨民主</p>
<p>賈尼尼主編「平民」週報，主張組織由「平民」而非由「政治家」指揮的「行政」國家。賈氏是一位口若懸河的演說家。他演說時姿態生動，語調激昂。他對於民主主義恨如切齒。他和他的黨徒贊成一位强有力的領袖，施用斬釘截鐵的手腕來治理國事。</p>
<p>此刻賈氏還沒有施用鐵腕政策，可是現在大多數的義大利人已經加人他的黨派了。這並非說義大利人不需要民主，反之，他們多數是竭力促其實現，但是義大利的新民主政府意見紛歧，各項問題無法解決，使他們對之發生觖望。在混亂的威脅下，在嚴冬的逼近中，義大利人民渴望着緊急的救濟。</p>
<p>義大利整個復興問題的重心在於糧食問題。欲獲得糧食，義大利的工業必須生產農具供國內應用，生產製造品運銷海外。欲使工廠開工，必須有煤。但是義大利每月所能生產的十二萬噸煤斤也不能開採，因爲礦工爲了養家活口，不得不停止工作去乞求食物。義大利的麺包配給量已經減少一半，義大利人一天所得到的加路里比歐洲的任何他國人民爲少。</p>
<p>義大利今昔觀</p>
<p>新法西斯主義一旦抬頭，已往的歷史必將重演於今日。在距今廿五年以前墨索里尼在羅馬召集第一次法西斯黨大會。當時正値全國民衆對於不利的和平條件深表忿懣，法西斯黨即利用此機會，並以救濟失業及通貨膨脹爲號召，募集了數千名黨員。不到一年墨索里尼的武裝挺進嚴即向羅屬進發，墨氏便一躍而爲義大利首相。</p>
<p>已故羅斯福總統的助手美國問題專家寇利博士曾在義大利居住兩個月，最近對人說；「當初使法西斯主義抬頭的一般經濟狀况依然存在於今日的義大利。正如在第一次世界大戰以後一樣，今日的義大利人對於和約否認義大利有控制特港及阜姆之權。法國已經把義大利北部的土地割去了幾小塊。義大利人覺得他們的對德宣戰，他們對聯合國勝利的貢獻，不應一筆抹煞。</p>
<p>正如一九二一年一樣，義大利目前正鬧着通貨膨脹和普遍的失業。義國人口只有四千五百萬，失業的倒有二百二十萬人。罷工和暴動與日俱增。去年秋間羅馬曾有數千失業者圍攻政府所在地維明那宮。事後警務當局查明此次暴動的主使者是兩個法西斯黨員。現政府不能防止暴動，正和一九二一年的情形一樣。</p>
<p>墨索里尼第二</p>
<p>在這一切現狀之下，賈尼尼的「平民陣綫」很可能成爲義大利的優勢政黨。在十月廿八日進軍羅馬紀念日，法西斯黨員數千人手執黑旗和手工製造的炸彈。</p>
<p>賈尼尼給我的印象幾乎十足是墨索里尼第二。他以第三流劇作家的資格，於一九二六年祖任電影雜誌編者，一九三〇年在宣傳部中祖任次要的職位，一九四一年正式加入法西斯黨。</p>
<p>一九四四年羅馬陷落以後幾個月，賈氏初次發行「平民」週報，作爲他的喉舌。第一期共印二萬份，當天售完，並再版三次。一時全國風從，趨之若鶩，政府頗具戒心，遂以　　法西斯的罪名對他起訴，勸令他的報紙暫時停刊，同時英國議會中對賈尼尼痛加斥責。但是義大利法院把他開釋了。</p>
<p>賈尼尼有富商兄弟二人給她支持。他們希望恢復帝制，因為帝制曾經支持了墨索里尼而使他們發了財。賈氏在編的「平民陣綫」召開第一次全國大會，加入了君政主義黨。</p>
<p>義國唯一希望</p>
<p>義大利的政黨各自爲謀，不　團結一致。假使各黨　　不及早團結，賈尼尼也許會有成功的一天。</p>
<p>目前義大利唯一的希望寄託在現任總理加斯貝利，是一位果敢的反法西斯主義者，他領導着義大利最强大的黨派基督敎民主黨。可惜加氏代表義國出席和平會議，不能爭得有利的和平條件，錯失了恢復義大利威望的機會。他此刻正以幹練外交家的風度，竭力覓求妥協，以保持他的岌岌可危的內閣。然而最關重要的一點是解決民衆的食糧問題和遏制通貨膨脹。他認為　　　東以後，義大利必須從海外獲得援助，以維持工廠的生產，否則法西斯必然要捲土重來的。</p>
<p>聯合國的態度</p>
<p>爲什麽聯合國容許新法西斯黨在一個盟佔領的國家滋長起來呢？那是因為法西斯黨紀　　常散漫，除了幾個　　　　以外，是無法加以壓制的。而況「平民」報的發行得到義大利某新閣統制機關的許可，盟軍對於該機關已經放棄其統制權。</p>
<p>到目前爲止，賈尼尼還沒有做出足以引起盟軍干涉的事情來。可是，萬一他果眞發動政變的話，那麽根據休戰條約的規定，英美軍隊可以立刻出動。除此以外，我們欲防止義大利再度遭殃，只有帮助它的人民重建一個健全而富有的的國家。</p>
<p>— 墨索里尼魅影籠罩下的新法西斯黨魁賈尼尼</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>四外次會議開幕　對德奧和約已開始了！</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>英美法蘇四國外次會議，於十四日在倫敦開幕，由英國外相貝文親臨主持，並向各國外次致歡迎辭，希望今後不復造成足使德國東山再起之局勢。從十五日起，正式開始討論對德奧兩國的和約草案，並將爲三月十日在莫斯科舉行的四國外長會議，擬就議事日程。所以這一次的四國外次會議，實爲對德奧和談的序慕。我們站在一九四七年的歲首，對於今年第一次國際會議，不得不表示殷切的期望。因爲這次會議對於今後國際局勢的發展，實有非常重大的關係。</p>
<p>德奧問題　分別處置</p>
<p>德國是第二次大戰的罪魁禍首，盟國對於德國自應予以嚴懲，責成其賠償各國所受的損失，同時並須特別重視其人民的再敎育，以肅淸人民所受納粹的麻醉與餘毒，務使其也成爲愛好和平的國家，不再威脅歐洲的和平與安全。此在奧地利，她是希特勒侵略主義者的犧牲品，盟國對於奧國，自應負起扶助其獨立的義務。不僅須在口頭上文字上允許其獨立，而且在實際上也應該予以經濟的援助，使其成爲中歐的安定勢力，做東歐與西歐的橋樑，所以四國外次討論對德奧兩國和約，係採取隔日討論的辦法，俾能分別處置。</p>
<p>英對奧國提出方案</p>
<p>對德奧問題，實爲今日歐洲最複雜的問題，四强對此意見旣不一致，就是，荷，比，盧，丹麥，捷克等國，均各有主張，在四國外次會議開幕之前，即已紛紛發表備忘錄，在政治上經濟上提出許多要求，使四國外次會議的工作益感困難。我們預料對德問題，一時不易解決，非留待至四國外長會議時不能商有成議。但是對於奧地利問題，列强意見比較接近，不難成立解決方案，英國代表所提出的和約草案，可望在原則上獲得通過，其要點如次：（一）恢復自由獨立之奧國；（二）盟國駐在奧境的軍隊一律撤退返國；（三）多瑙河航行自由；（四）允許奧國加入聯合國機構爲會員國；（五）恢復一九三八年奧國的疆界；（六）不承認南捷兩國所提出之對奧領土要求；（七）不要求賠款；（八宗敎自由，貿易自由，不得歧視。法國國民大</p>
<p>法國政局　英法締盟</p>
<p>法國國民大會與參議院於十六日舉行聯席會議，選舉法蘭西共和國總統，社會黨領袖歐禮和，以四五二票的絕對多數獲選；甫自倫敦返國的勃魯姆內閣，即依照法國憲法的規定，向歐禮和總統提出辭呈。歐禮和乃任命社會黨要人賴馬迪埃爲內閣總理，與各方接洽組閣事宜。新閣乃在各黨派的合力支持之下成立了，從此法國的政治也就將臨時政體吿一段落，而走上民主憲政的　正軌了。</p>
<h3>動盪中之阿拉伯</h3>
<p>— 成琮</p>
<p>中東正在多事之秋。在報紙上我們讀到種種變亂的消息，如巴勒斯坦炸彈案，開羅的亂事，和蔓延各個阿拉伯國家的示威運動。中東的局勢對世界影響很大，牠可以決定我們和下一代所處的是怎樣性質的世界，因爲在這種種紛擾中蘇聯利英美的利益直接發生磨擦。數百萬的阿拉伯人，在此再生時代，動盪不安，至今還沒有決定往那裏走：走向東方，還是西方？走向共產主義，還是民主政治？</p>
<p>阿拉伯人正在劇烈的轉變中。在大馬士革有戴着面紗，在深閨潛修的少女，而貼鄰的現代婦女，却穿着最時式的好萊塢服裝，駕駛自備汽車，到城市去參加婦女大會，爭取婦女選舉權。</p>
<p>沙漠裏逮河民族的酋長，操着一族人民的生殺之權。高興的時候，可以用火刑燒死妻妾，有時他這樣殺了人，一方面却駕着飛機到開羅去向敎主禱吿。</p>
<p>西里亞阿拉波城某一區城裏，陳列着工業革命的全部程序。一方面有織工在窰洞式的店舖背後，用老式織機織布。每天的收入只値美金五角。而同一區域的另一端，有現代的紗廠，擁有一千二百名工人，和最新式的機器，還有自助餐室，淋浴，醫院，和宿舍等設備。</p>
<p>中東大部份城市以外的地方，封建制度仍舊存在着。整個村鎭，往往屬於一個地主。他和別個族長聯合起來。許多同等的族長，再向較大的族長効忠。　但是也有若干進步的地方。像在伊拉克這封建情形最壞的地方，有限的良田，酋長竟有每人佔有十萬畝的。伊拉克政府尙無沒收這些財產的力量，就實行一種訐劃，把底格里斯下流的荒地，劃成每塊面積八十五畝的農塲，免費分配給願意耕種的人。五年這後，這塊田就算彵的財產。</p>
<p>需要改良的是勞工方面。阿拉伯工人至今還沒有法律保障。童工也不受法律的限制，優良著名的東方地毯是童工的柔弱的手織成的。他們坐在織機面前狹板上，雙足踏動織機，每天工作十個多小時，造成骨胳的畸形發展。廠主把工廠當作學校，敎育是强迫的。每天一小時半讀書寫字和算術，九小時半織毯子。</p>
<p>在奧斯曼帝國統治之下，巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人幾乎全是文肓。現在有十二萬人入學讀書。在耶路撒冷有一所大學，最近二十五年內，埃及建立了二個國立大學。</p>
<p>反對猶太主義　不信任英帝國</p>
<p>阿拉伯人並不信任英帝國主義。過去阿拉伯的經濟全操在英國人手裏，對外商業也大都限於英國貨，雖然他們自己承認，英國勢力一旦撤退，影饗並不有利，他們總是想獲得自決的機會。</p>
<p>對於法國惡感更深，在委任統治勒波諾，和西里亞的過程中，法國施用武力對付阿拉伯人甚至在一九四五年轟炸大馬士革種種措施，久已使法國與中東的聯繫趨於絕望。</p>
<p>阿拉伯是極反對猶太主義的。巴勒斯坦問題很難和平解決。各阿拉伯國家團結很堅，在開羅亂事之後，到處有示威運動法國在大馬士革的舉動，把整個阿拉伯世界刺激得發在。猶太主義又使阿拉伯人更形團結。</p>
<p>阿拉伯人向那裏走？轉向蘇聯嗎？蘇聯對於阿拉伯各邦，確是非常注意。每一個都會，蘇聯使館的規模比英美的使館宏大，雖然她的商業關係比英美小。每一個蘇聯使館是蘇聯的宜傳中心。最近克林姆宮方面，似乎對蘇聯境內的回敎徒非常關切，千方百計，使他們和阿拉伯回敎徒聯繫起來，許多蘇聯人民，還參加開羅的回敎大學。</p>
<p>東方文化發源於阿拉伯。當一千二百年以前，謨罕默德的信徒結合地中海東南一帶民族，組成單一宗敎的帝國的時候，阿拉伯文化達到頂點，可是後來被外來民族征服了。在土耳其族四百年統治中，停止進步。當西方文化流入阿拉伯的時期，還是始終停滯着。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰給與阿拉伯反抗土耳其的機會。他們和協約國駢肩作戰，深信可以獲得自由。可是戰後協約國會議把巴勒斯坦，外約但，和伊拉克給英國委任統治，把西里亞，黎巴嫩給法國統治。埃及成爲英國的保護國。</p>
<p>阿拉伯人曾經反對，這種統治，交涉的結果過所得無幾，並沒有眞正的獨立。第二次大戰之後，英法仍想留在那裏。阿拉伯人表示不歡迎。現在英法勢力在撤退了，留下一部份的空隙。</p>
<p>戰時美國曾給他們以物質上的資助。現在只留下商業航空綫和敎育事業。（譯自讀者文摘）</p>

<h3>女性的風格</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>蘇州這一個城市，在二千多年以前，吳王夫差和吳王闔　遺留了下來許多美麗的故事，中國歷史上出名的女子之一西施，曾在這裏度過她的靑春的歲月；在二千多年以後的今天，這城市密佈着河港，池塘和古井，叢生着茉莉，攻瑰和紫蘿蘭，到處是淸澈的水和濃郁的花，水和花象徵着這裏所生長的男安的性情。</p>
<p>絳燕是典型的蘇州女性她的作品「微波辭」是一種織巧的安性的風格底表現，她的窄狹的生活圈，使我們聯想到籠子裏的畫眉和玻璃缸裏的金魚。</p>
<p>從詩歌的語主來說，或者從詩歌的形式來說，絳燕依舊滯留在五四時代的階段，她受了舊詩詞太多的影響，不能擺脫那些陳舊的語彙的拘束，甚至寫出「相像古代飛龍馳聘的神姿，乃失笑於高秋鷹隼之迅疾」（空軍頌）這種空洞而晦澀的句子，到抗戰後期。她的語言和型式都有了一種解放比較能够自由地抒發她的感情，形象地描寫她的素材，然而解放有着限度，就像纏脚的人去掉纏脚布以後，仍舊不能完全恢復天然的美感。</p>
<p>現實的世界如此廣闊，現實的社會如此豐富，絳燕只是生活在她自己的想像所美化的環境裏，因此，她寫着：</p>
<p>瓶花縈迴着溫柔的香氣，</p>
<p>輕軟的被褥也全都是溫柔的。</p>
<p>小病是有着閑適的趣味的。</p>
<p>繡枕邊的細語是低低地，</p>
<p>一些煦問，一些憐惜的眼光，</p>
<p>今天你有更多的溫柔的，</p>
<p>你的聲音更低更低</p>
<p>就不淸，什麽，一個吻嗎？</p>
<p>親愛的可以，但是要輕輕的，</p>
<p>「小病是有着閒適的趣味的」最能槪括地說明絳燕的意識形態，充份地顯示了她的唯美的享樂的傾向，在古代，西施之所以被人欣賞，是因爲她的病態，而在今天，中國的智識婦女已經進步到以疾病爲本身的享受了！</p>
<p>一個詩人必須在思想上有哲學的基礎才能做到內容的充實，才能進入藝術的領械，才能深深地體味生命的眞諦。而她只有小兒女的纏綿的愛情，而道一種愛情使她在從事詩歌創作的時候，不允許她有冷靜地觀察現實世界和現實社會的機會。</p>
<p>女性的溫柔也許是生理條件決定的，女詩人的作品裏的溫柔氣氛也許是無法避免，甚至不必避免的，然而太多的溫柔對於一個女性無疑是嚴重的病態，對於詩歌藝術更是烈性的麻醉，除了給予變態心理的讀者以滿足之外，沒有任何意義可言的。</p>
<p>絳燕曾經描寫過抗戰，雖然描寫得這樣觀念化，這樣隔膜，其實也可以看作爲一種進步，並且不是全然徒勞的，經過這種嘗試，或者說是考騐，她自己應該知道和這個科學的羣衆的時代距離得多麽遙遠？而織巧的風格和這苦難的壯烈的民族戰爭是多麼地不調和！</p>
<p>女作家女詩人往往在作品裘洋溢着崇高的母性，母性的愛是一種純粹給予者的愛，當我們在讀冰心的「寄小讀者」，就好像自己的母親或姐姐在親切地和我們說話。絳燕所表現的溫柔，僅僅是女性的，「乳兒」一詩，她嘗試表現母性的愛，不但勉强，並且完全是對成人的口吻，沒有一分母性愛的自然流露。</p>
<p>「微波辭」以及它的作者是寂寞的，正如一株瓶花，在溫室裏寂寞地開放寂寞地謝落，寂寞地發散着香氣，只有在溫室喪生活的人們去欣賞。</p>
<p>從土星筆會到中國詩藝社，他們這一個集團始終擁有一部份唯美主義傾向的詩人，而到現在，組織的本身是整個解體的了，這是使人不勝今昔之感的。孫望常任俠，在銘竹，林咏泉和絳燕，在中國詩藝社是五位最有前途的詩人，爲了讀者，爲了中國詩歌運動，我希望他們開發自已的新底道路。</p>
<p>聽說蘇州的寒山寺裏的鐘，在敵僞盤據期間被盜，我覺得這是一種象徵蘇州應該結束它已往的歷史，而展開生命的新頁了。</p>
<p>我希望十年以後的蘇州，在這平曠的田野上矗立着像樹林般密集的烟突，開設無數的工廠，爲中國的工業化而建設，而蘇州的居民，不再陶醉於溫柔和閒適情調，走出窄狹的生活圈，努力從事生產。我爲詩人絳燕和她的故鄉祝福。</p>
<h3>楹聯閒話</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>楹聯雖小道有可觀焉，兪曲園言：楹帖最難，須有魄力，有風韻，兼之乃稱佳作。因舉二聯，粤中五層樓聯云：「千萬劫危樓尙存，問誰摘斗摩星，目空今古。五百年古侯安在？祇我倚欄看劍，淚灑英雄！」越秀山觀音閣聯云：「現大士化身，問誰仙佛因緣在？弔越王遺蹟，從古英雄感慨多。」此四明李棣華作，魄力風韻，兼而有之。曲園激賞，非偶然也。</p>
<h3>荒島</h3>
<p>— 郊奔</p>
<p>幾千年都是死寂寂地，</p>
<p>無人烟的荒島呵……</p>
<p>然而有一年，</p>
<p>荒島上發出了靑草，</p>
<p>靑草裏出現一個優美的女孩，</p>
<p>她像那荒島上的一朶小白雲，</p>
<p>愉快而純眞，</p>
<p>她在那兒過着她底生活，</p>
<p>像靑草一樣沒有憂鬱，</p>
<p>陽光每天給她送來溫暖，</p>
<p>海波每天給她送來淸凉，</p>
<p>因此養成她熱情而寧靜的性格，</p>
<p>崇高的思想——　　就這樣在她腦子裏慢慢地醞釀而成長。</p>
<p>然而有一天，</p>
<p>颶風從海那邊吹來，　　吹來了一個老頭兒——　　他是她底父親，　　他用一夜的工夫，</p>
<p>向她講叙他怎樣把她放在這荒島上的故事，　　他以一種哀惋的音調，</p>
<p>說這幾年的時光是怎樣過去的，　　他像寒冬的溪流，</p>
<p>絮絮地談叙他底一生——　　他哭了，</p>
<p>他底女兒哭得更傷心，</p>
<p>這時天黑得很呵……</p>
<p>又一陣颶風，</p>
<p>吹來了一個富翁，</p>
<p>他頭上戴着皮帽，</p>
<p>身上穿着皮衣，</p>
<p>手裏還拿着一根皮鞭子，</p>
<p>皮鞭上面包一塊亮的黄金——</p>
<p>他向那老頭做了一個眼色，　　老頭便將女孩交給了他，</p>
<p>像交換着一件東西。</p>
<p>荒島慌亂地抖擻起來，</p>
<p>海瘋狂地在滾轉……</p>
<h3>失業者</h3>
<p>— Herbert　Shaw著　兪中欣譯</p>
<p>三個月的失業，已使得他變成粗暴及魯莽了；他的面頰也瘦削得難以使人相信，處處都流露出一種萎頓，疲憊的神采。他差不多將近有兩天沒有碰着一些麵包屑，那兩天前的食物彷彿在他的眼前眩耀着，啊！他是多麼想念着食物呀！</p>
<p>他的右手插在衣袋裏，將他唯一的財產——兩個辨士——揑得緊緊的，好似是怕它會遺失掉。雖然他見絞盡了腦汁；想暹了心思；始終不能撇開道個念頭，可是飢餓是不會饒恕他的，這却使他有些難以忍受，不時地吐出幾聲怨言，至於他的視綫，却時常射向商店的橱窗內，望着各種鮮艷而誘人的色彩發楞，這彷彿能給他一些欣慰吧！</p>
<p>刺骨的寒風像核利刃戳進了他的心中，不由使他戰慄着，突然憤怒的火花在他的心中，血管內散開了，一個秘密的慾望指使着他越過了馬路，藏蔽在一間房子的門前，靜覷着他唯一痛恨的仇人——商店主人——在公共汽車站前徘徊着，至於他的種種苦楚——飢寒，失業等等，那一樣不是他仇人給予他的——一個狡黠的商人造成的一切。</p>
<p>三年前，砲火的氣息充滿了世界上，不景氣的潮流向四方汜濫着，他的一爿商店在這風浪中傾搖不定，幸賴他的努力，他的奮鬥方才渡過危險，然而他的商店却已破舊了；在不多時之後，不幸的他，厄運又重新降臨到他的頭上，原來那狡點的商人依頓着靈活的手腕，籠絡着官長，用着卑鄙的手段，將那爿商店强横地收買去，讓他流浪在街頭上，孤單地擺設着小攤，以維特生活，可是，現在他已經沒有資本再繼續擺設牠。……</p>
<p>他在擁擠中隨着那商人跨上了公共汽車，掏出他最後的二辨士，換了一張車票，於是他隨便揀了一隻靠近那商人的座位坐下，雙目盯住他的一隻皮包，他知道皮包內是塞滿了錢的。</p>
<p>在公共汽車尙未到目的地時，他已將計劃打算好了：——</p>
<p>他知道那商人下車後，必定要沿着一條通到他那辦事處的石子路上走過，那是一條冷僻的地方，很少有警察在那處巡邏的，那時候的確是動手的好機會了——他料想着那商人挾着貴重的皮包，僅有單手可以抵禦，那却不碍事的——他準備劫走那皮包。至於那守財奴的生命，尙可以饒恕他的。</p>
<p>——一連串得意的微笑，現出於他的臉上，他並不覺得這種手段的卑鄙及殘酷，祇覺得這是那狡黠者應得的懲戒。</p>
<p>一陣雜亂的聲音打斷了他的心想：</p>
<p>「胡說，我明明將一先令交給你的，並且軍票和找頭都在我的皮夾裏呢？」一個時髦的婦女憤怒地對賣票者說這。</p>
<p>「太太，你大槪攪錯了吧！」賣票者冷冷地說着：「假使你已經買過了，那麼車票呢？」</p>
<p>她在皮夾裏探索了一會，依然尋不出車票，祗好承認了自己的錯誤，補給了車資，跨下了公共汽車。</p>
<p>突然，他在他的脚旁發現了一片微小的光亮閃礫着，他貪婪地望了一眼，於是俯下了身，經他重新挺直了身體的時候，已待有着一個先令緊揑在手掌中，他向四周望望，發出了得意的笑聲，又朝窗外看看，明顯的廣吿映在他的眼簾上，又快樂似地笑着。剛才預備搶刧，復仇的念頭，早已被喜悅同化了。</p>
<p>公共汽車漸漸地慢着，慢着……一來直到停下，他望着對面的飯店的巨大廣吿，站起身，匆忙地奔下公共汽車，跨向人行道去。</p>
<p>一陣濃厚而誘人的香味，調和在喧嘩的氣氛中，他戰憟地推開了飯店的門。啊！他是多麼想念着食物呀！</p>
<h3>村景</h3>
<p>— 洛萊</p>
<p>（法國近代名畫）</p>
<h3>鴨綠江畔之冰　桐窗雜憶之三</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>鴨綠江，可以說是中國和朝鮮分界的一條江，的確，鴨綠江的水綠得像鴨頭上的毛。但冬天，這江是完全冰凍了。和朝鮮分界處水陸交通的樞紐是安東。從安東這地名，可以想見古唐代征服高麗的光榮，和安東相對，隔着江，是朝鮮的新義州，曾經，日本人在這江上造着條鐵路橋，中國人，日本人，朝鮮人，在這橋上下分彼此地走過，西服，和服，大褂，白褂子，是這裏幾國人民的區別。從六月起，鴨綠江就下着雪，江口因冰凍而封鎖了，江面上的冰很厚，冰上加雪，雪凍爲冰，江岸上稷稜的冰塊，人在路上走，很容易滑倒，但道裏的人常從冰上渡江，不僅冰上可以走人，牲口拉的大車，也可以從冰上過去，小汽車也從道上面駛過這很好看，雪白的冰面上，黑色的人們繁密地來往，像白麵粉上撒着些芝麻，但最好看的是朝鮮人，冬天，他們也穿着白外衣，白布籠着髮，個個像丁憂的孝子，他們大半將東西頂在頭上，在冰上走着。更好看的是朝鮮的少女，她們，穿着水紅色的上衣，白色的裙子，　着短帶，挽着髮髻，有特殊的風韻。如果說朝鮮是箕子之後，而他們的服裝沒有經過改變的話，這大的就是古代女人的風度了。</p>
<p>望着這一種冰天雪地中來往行人的忙迫，會發生特殊的感想，但決下能以爲他們履冰如地的習慣沒有危險，常有冰塊忽然裂開，人掉下水去的時候，有時可以看見人從冰上爬起來，但有時，人下去之後就不見了。</p>
<p>從安東走過鐵橋，是朝鮮的新義州，那是朝鮮的風土了。一幢幢不很高的，四</p>
<p>而有迴廊的房舍，在成列的常靑樹的隙地裏，屋子的建造是矮小的亭榭式，外面沒有圍牆的阻隔，晚上，人睡在這樣的家裏，僅是關上出入的門，就可以過夜，我很懷疑，朝鮮難道至今還是夜不閉戶，路不拾遺的國家嗎？</p>
<p>聽，淸雅悅耳，圓轉如珠，女子也特別長得秀美，苗條約姿態，倒有點近乎姑蘇。在松花江上駛着的是獨木船，那是整個大樹幹，挖空了肚子，用以作爲渡水的工具，所以，那船是特別長，坐船的人，應該是兩個一排，兩個一排，成一條雙行的縱隊似的坐在裏面，倒很有秩序。晚上，獨木船都靠在江邊。和幾個朋友，買點酒菜，坐在這獨木船的肚子裏，好像駕着一條大魚，望見月亮從南山後升起來，漸漸地升到天半，照着江水，像一片碧琉璃，「月光映水水映天」，在這情况之下，高唱「將軍三箭定天山，壯士長歌入漢關」之句，再來一個吉林的女朋友，嘿！你會覺得東三省是美極！了</p>
<h3>洞庭落　桐窗雜憶之四</h3>
<p>— 前人</p>
<p>奇怪的是，許多湖南朋友不大談到洞庭的美，但我，直到現在忘不了洞庭湖。那是二十多年前，坐在輪船上，駛到洞庭湖的北口，拋了錨。是傍晚，太陽掛在西天，離湖面一丈多高，照着岳州山上的城牆，像醉翁的臉，俗稱「八百里洞庭」，洞庭湖的水面的確很寬。和岳州相對的一面，看不見界限，是天水相接的一綫。水和長江一樣黄濁，而且有險惡的波濤，對着這湖，像浮在海面上一樣，夕陽照着湖面，萬道金光，閃閃波動，實在很是壯觀。遠遠望見湖的南口，許多靑山，浮在水面，從那裹面進去，是湘江，長沙，衡山，那裏面包藏着許多名城和古蹟，而洞庭湖上的落日，漸漸由水而墮下去的時候，遠遠地，在湖心雄峙着的，像爬着的獅子似的君山，也漸漸地隱沒到黄昏的黑暗中去了。那山裏面好像藏着多神秘，幾點漁燈在湖面上閃起光來。</p>
<p>有一次，我從岳陽樓畔坐着船到君山去，船夫搖了差不多一天，靠近君山，又是落日低埀在湖面上的時候了。從滑足的亂石上爬上去，那裏面是另外一個世界，築在山腿上的君山書院，早已頽廢了。從破敗的龍王廟轉過去，尋到了瀟湘妃子的墓，那附近，有叢叢的斑竹。竹之所以有斑，據說是妃子曾經在這上面洒了淚，從此可以想見妃子之傷心，而竹之所以可貴。雖然這不過是古老的傳說，但常作眞有其事想，君山裏面的一切，好像更有意義了。在這裹面可以看見稻田，漁船，村洛，蘆葦，森林，也有耕牛和漁網，但住着的人實在不多，生活得異常簡陋。餓了，找不到飯店，和打漁人家商議，給些錢，請他下些麵，也不過是將晒乾了的黑麵煮熱了，放上一把鹽而已。他們其實有魚，但他想留着到岳州去賣，決不取出款待遠道而來的客人。君山的四周是無盡的蘆葦，被水冲着，被風刮着，蕩蕩漾漾，顯山這裏形勢的險惡，秋天，無際的蘆花，在秋風中搖擺，這裏是孤寂，凄凉。</p>
<p>在君山上，在洞庭湖畔，會常想起屈原，古舜，娥皇，女英的故事，比在别處想起這些故事更能引起許多的幻想。</p>
<h3>斷章</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>螢</p>
<p>閃爍的，有着微藍光澤的流螢，多少感傷的詩人替你寫下了多少魄麗的，含着濃郁的憂鬱的詩篇。</p>
<p>在黑夜裏跋踄的人，摸紫在黝暗的路上，無邊的夜的暗流，汛濫在山野，一片迷茫。路沒有了，路被黑暗吞噬了。跋踄的人找不到自己應該朝向那個方向走的路，他們焦灼的期待着一星光亮。然而在這荒凉空漠的山野，那裏去找光亮呢！</p>
<p>於是他們想起螢來了，他們就這樣靠着那一星幽光的螢火走完一條漫長的崎嶇而陡峭的夜路。</p>
<p>波浪</p>
<p>波浪是船家女郞懷想遠征在海上同風暴撙鬥的情人而流的淚。</p>
<p>波浪是船家悲泣海上生活的黯淡而流的淚。</p>
<p>波浪是船家目睹着自己底隻被野蠻的海盜們搶走無以爲生而流的淚。</p>
<p>那些洶湧的滾翻的浪濤呢！你知道你曾經捲滅過多少個悲苦的匍匐在生活的鞭子下終日守望着海的那些善良忠厚的海之子底生命。他們生在海上，長在海上，把自己底寳貴的春靑和那一串珍珠般發蒲金色光澤的日子交給了海，同海一起生活，同海一起呼吸。</p>
<p>然而他們底生活是愁慘的。</p>
<p>他們底生命同他們底生活那樣愁慘的覆滅在無情的浪濤捲翻裏。</p>
<p>帆</p>
<p>住在南方的海島上使我有着許多美麗的記憶的是；那些一片片飄浮在海上的風帆，慣於海上生活的人，扯起一葉飄泊的風帆同滔天的狂濤駭浪搏鬥，他們用自己底血寫下了多少英雄們底英勇的戰鬥壯烈的犧牲的那些可歌可泣的詩篇。在海濱生長的人，他們一個個都慕戀海上點點的風帆和那光亮闪耀的燈塔。常他們看到那個在黑暗的海上照耀的燈塔，他們會想起在晴夜裏航駛迷失了方向幾乎爲海所呑噬的那個風帆的故事，許多人都感謝海上的燈塔。因此燈塔爲航海者所懷戀。</p>
<p>海鷗</p>
<p>我懷戀那些同波浪搏鬥的風帆。然而我更懷戀那些繞着風帆拍着浪花飛翔的海鷗，它們長年翱翔在海上，放歌在海上，它們是勇於戰鬥的。</p>
<p>暴風雨來了，它們仍然安詳的飛翔在海上，一雙矯健的翅膀擊起無數白沫浪花，跳着神秘的海底舞，於是我人迷了。</p>
<p>從此我便懷戀着海鷗。</p>
<p>如今八年了，我沒有看到過海，我不知道海鷗還繞着風帆放歌否？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>酷寒話皚雪</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>鵝毛大雪　伴着財神</p>
<p>在傳說中的「財神下凡」的日子，鵝毛般的大雪下個不停。是給希望中的人民澆一頭冷水哩？抑是「上天」歡送「財神爺」而撒下一片六出之花呢？</p>
<p>我們都與伴着風雪而生的感情熟悉。那寗靜，產生風雪的低掛的雲層使人憂鬱；但是一待雪花飛揚下降，興奮就代替了憂鬱。對於我們，蟄伏的突然變成了活動的。在神經，腦細胞和身體中，我們對這種突然的變化發生反應。</p>
<p>雪花的模樣如此的變化無窮，可說沒有一個人曾經看見過兩片完全相同者。在一次風雪中，一位美國科學家曾經估計在一畝地上舖蓋着一千萬億片雪花。每一片都是一朶微小的結晶的花。它們有一些小得僅長百分之一吋；就是最大的，直徑也不會超過半吋。</p>
<p>一簇雪堆中的無數的雪花反映自然的無底的創作力。它是個別的。但是，每一片雪花都是由於它的過去的經騐而成型的。一位專家從一具顯微鏡中窺視，能够發現雪花的肇始的端倪和它的隨後的變異奇事的徵候。雖然有許多關於雪花的和生活的事情始終還是一個謎，但是比希臘人稱雪花爲「羊毛水」的時期淸楚得多了。</p>
<p>每一朶鉛色的冬雲都是一所巨大的貯藏結晶品的倉庫，在它後面製造雪花的工作在進行蒲。一片雪花通常是一朶冬雲的微小的凍結的殘片。原料是大氣中的不可見的蒸汽和水氣。</p>
<p>皚皚白棉　怎樣形成</p>
<p>過去，雪花的構造的基本規則是：它們和蜂房的小窩一樣都是六角形的。從前的學者相信這條規則是沒有例外的。現在，我們却知道：像三角形雪花之類的變態，也時常發生。但是記錄在影片和圖畫上的十萬種雪花中，的確全是縮小的六出之花，並且每一個凸角都幾乎不變的是六十度。</p>
<p>似是而非的，皚雪並非眞正是白色的。至少，當它在空中結晶時不是白色的。它大部份和玻璃一樣的透明。但是，常它成堆的降落到地面上時，結晶體反射各方向的光綫，產生一種純白的觀感。</p>
<p>許多的學者們和科學家們都同樣的獻身於研究雪花的私生活，美國紐约州的通用電氣公司研究實騐室的科學家文山特，夏弗也是其中之一。近年來，他發明了一種保持雪花的精緻形態的方法，這方法很簡單，就是讓雪花降落在一種透明的可塑體的流質內，這種可墪體流質能够迅速的變硬，使降落其中的雪花變成不走樣的化石一般，這種「化石化的雪花」能够一片片的銼下來製成玻璃幻燈片，於空閒時，在顯微鏡下或照相中觀察。它們不受時間或氣候的變化，是永久被保持下來了。</p>
<p>爲了替學生們蒐集雪花，夏弗曾經到華盛頓山的嶺峯上去過。有一次，他在一架每小時飛行二百哩，在地面上一萬呎高穿越一陣風雪的陸軍轟炸機中收集雪之結晶體。</p>
<p>雪花象徵　瞬息即逝</p>
<p>在藝術中，雪花的形整代表最短促與消失性，它是美麗的脆弱性的極端的代表。在所有的降雪的區域中，在無數的從冬雲中降落下來的結晶形的詩的大軍中，僅有相對的幾千種形態被筆或者攝影機保持下來。其餘的，永遠的消逝了，甚至在人類的記憶中都已不知。</p>
<p>但是，在自然中，這種美麗的脆弱性並未引起嘆息。自然沒有樹起紀念碑。從鉛色的天氣成堆下降而消失的雪花並沒有要求也來應得我們的憐憫。你假定它是什麽，它就是什麽。圍爐賞雪與單衣抖擻的人，對雪花的感情，不是南轅北轍嗎？</p>
<h3>尾巴</h3>
<p>— 殊晌</p>
<p>一大羣蘇聯老鼠，從中國逃回，蘇聯母鷄問牠：</p>
<p>「你們爲什麽逃回來的」？</p>
<p>這羣老鼠回答說：「中國人極喜歡我們尾巴，差一點全被他們截去了！」</p>
<h3>年鑼鼓聲在尾響　緊密鼙鼓動地來</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>中国尾年頭，年鑼鼓的聲音，東也「砰砰硼」！西也「砰砰硼」的敲着，眞感到熱鬧非常，充滿着「昇平的氣象」。</p>
<p>但是新歲已經過了好幾天，年鑼鼓的聲音將成「尾饗」了！</p>
<p>而繼之以代的，却是戰塲的「聲鼓」，正敲得多麽「緊密」！這一種聲鼓的的聲調，是「打！打！打！」「光！光！光！」「打光！打光！打打光！」</p>
<p>年鑼鼓和鼙鼓敲出來的聲調，顯然大大不同，一是「歌舞昇平」，而一是「兵荒馬亂」！</p>
<p>當然，我們歡喜聽「歌舞昇平的年鑼鼓」，而憎惡着「兵荒馬亂的鼙鼓！」</p>
<h3>當心「牌九司務」</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>陰曆新正，上海人除看戲跳舞外，不論商店居家，莫不麻將牌九，興高彩烈，好在一般店夥，工友，娘姨等輩，衣袋中大都塞滿了年賞花紅，及時行樂，輸贏幾個錢，是滿不在乎的。因此，牌九司務看準這個機會，設法混進來參加戰陣，撈你一筆外快。</p>
<p>前天報載鎭江路天和染坊，各職員在號中聚賭牌九，有吳學羣者，偕同不知姓名者二人，前往參加，约半小時，當塲有孫馨東者，已輸去現鈔三十餘萬。內中一賭客名傅致良，忽說彼　來人，其中有詐，恐係牌九司務。吳學羣等旣被識破，出門跑去云云。照此新聞看來，這種牌九司務，一定是下駟之材，所以被人識破。技術高明的牌九司務，在整百整千萬的塲面上，始肯一展他的手段，一年生活，全賴在元且至元宵這幾天裏頭。</p>
<p>什麽叫做牌九司務？他們有着一對尖銳限光，和十個靈活的手指。一付三十二隻龍牌，上面大半用竹背　成，竹背上面有隠约綫條約竹脈，牌的竹脈，每隻不同，在牌九司務眼中，只要他翻閱兩三遍。隻隻都能認識，無異透視的X光。他的手指，也有極大的功用，兩粒牙豆擲出去，使它翻個身，確定幾點，他都有把握。順着這種精技的賭徒，眞是無往不利。奉勸迷於睹博的人們，務須小心嚴防，不要再上牌九司務的大當。</p>
<h3>羅斯福的故事</h3>
<p>— 春良</p>
<p>碰壁</p>
<p>一個使人最心愛的羅斯福故事是講白宮的訪問者，他對羅斯福批評着說：『總統光生，你怎樣竟能够在這個世界上得到這樣良好的忍耐性———每天你所遇到的煩惱糾紛又是這樣的多？」</p>
<p>羅斯福厲害地回答着說：「假使你化費了二年功夫去學習如何碰壁，碰壁碰得你的足趾腫痛得甚麼似的了，然從，你就獲得了忍耐性。』</p>
<p>年齡</p>
<p>在雅爾達會議的最後一天，有一個休息的時間，讓大家互相交際一下。陶格拉斯，康乃爾來和羅斯福閒談，他問：「總統先生，你現在幾歲了？」</p>
<p>羅斯福回答着說：『根據日曆上計算，我的年紀是六十二歲，但是在要做工作的時候，我是三十五歲。」</p>
<p>大家都對</p>
<p>一個傳說講兩個爭執着的人們，在報告總統時竟得到同樣的回答，某一個時候，一個參議員在羅斯福面前訴說了他的理由，羅斯福對他說：「不錯，你是對的！」</p>
<p>後來，叧外的一個參議員來了，他把相反的爭論的理由說了出來，羅斯福對他說：「不錯，你是對的！』</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人，她一直立在勞邊，後來，她說：「但是你根本不可能贊成兩個完完全全相反的理由呀！」</p>
<p>羅斯福總統據說這樣的回答她：「不錯，你是對的！』</p>
<h3>不是笑話</h3>
<p>— 殊響</p>
<p>一盜於伏法時，警察持槍謂之日：「我因爲吃這碗殺人飯，沒有辦法，你死後不要怨我。」盜曰：「我也爲吃飯而死，怨你做什麽。」</p>
<p>蘇北被淸算後，民衆還鄕，在牆上看到×××的肖像，兒子問父親說：「這是啥人」？「這是×××」。「這人幹什麽的」？「這人幹解放的，解放我們的鍊條」。「鍊條是什麼」兒子又怪異地問。「鍊條是母親的金鍊條，和我的銀錶鍊」</p>
<p>新兵上火綫，遇砲彈炸去一隻手大喊曰：「這怎麽得了，我一生完了」。傍一戰友曰：「那是小事，你看王得勝頭炸去了，他一聲都不響」。</p>
<p>西湖靈隱寺飛來峯前亭中有聯句曰：「泉是幾時冷起，峯從何處飛來」？有人加句於下曰：「着杭州市政府查明具報。」</p>
<h3>「空帶」</h3>
<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>防水·防熱·防冷·　戰爭的貢獻</p>
<p>自從戰爭結束以來，有一種新的秘密武器，報章上始終未曾提到隻字，甚至日本屈膝後六個月，也僅有少許科學家知道它。</p>
<p>這件謎樣的東西不是雷達，也不是原子機。它是一段織物！一種新的織物，有着奇異的興奮的性質，叫做「空帶」。</p>
<p>一件空帶製成的外套能够防冷，防熱和防水。</p>
<p>液狀的「空帶膠」能够用噴霧器使之覆蔽在你的汽車的內部的表面（包括玻璃），使它能適合於最熱的夏季氣候或是冬季的酷寒。這並無窒息的危險，因爲空帶能够「呼吸」，換句話說，就是讓空氣在它的表面進出。</p>
<p>運動衣的　最好原料</p>
<p>空帶業以替各地的運動家解决着衣的問題，假如你在熱帶狩獵穿着熱帶的物質加上空帶的衣飾，你便不會熟了。反之，你在寒帶穿了合着的空帶羊毛衫，便能使你抵禦寒冬和冷霜。</p>
<p>捕鱒的漁夫知道橡皮靴並不完全滿意，加上空帶能造成一雙溫暖的防水的靴子，即使你站在水中有兩呎深，還會使你的脚出汗。</p>
<p>假如，在搖船的時候，你失足落水，水的深度超過你的身長，你用不着發急的游泳。空帶的物質有完全的浮力，能救你的性命。</p>
<p>除了以上各優點外，雷貝克在「摩托新聞」上說：「空帶可以縫製任何厚度，式樣或者顏色的衣着，這種新物質保護人類對抗氣候和潮濕的可能性是無限的」。</p>
<p>密西根大學的兩位敎授：紐堡博士和巴泰爾博士是創造這個新的神奇的織物的大功臣。當紐堡在戰時任「國家研究所」的研究員時，他看到一種簡單的衣服迫切的需要，這種衣服能够在變化的高度中或者被迫降落水中時，保護我們的飛行員。</p>
<p>沒有一樣已知的物質令人滿意。羊毛有優良的保暖性，但是不能抗禦潮濕。橡皮能够防水，可是非常稀少並且防冷的效果非常之小。</p>
<p>紐堡和巴泰爾在註明「秘密」兩個宇的實騐室中長時間的工作，加上軍部和民間硏究員的協助，終於在一九四四年九月發明了空帶。</p>
<p>壯志未酬　戰爭结束</p>
<p>一架運輸機忽促的起飛，將第一批貸運到冲繩島。在那裏，健兒們熱烈的接受這種防禦的，奇異的新物質。但是，在空帶能够輸送到所有的戰綫之前，戰爭結束了。</p>
<p>今天，高度的機械在大量製造着空帶，供給全美武裝的和平時期的隊伍，也同樣的供給意料之外的民間的需要。</p>
<p>按照專家的說法，這種新的織物將用爲兩種通常所有的物質（如棉布，螺縈，或者絲綢）的夾層，這樣，便能使一件衣服對抗氣候和潮濕的侵襲。</p>
<p>製造空帶的詳情還是一個秘密。可是，我們已知道基本的原料是一種叫「矽酸乳膠」的普通的化學品。同時，也洩露出來：在製造空帶的某一階段，配合一種似絨毛的東西以製成一種救生帶用的可驚塡空物，因爲它的浮力比軟木或者塡枕褥用的絲棉樹一種子上的柔毛更大。</p>
<p>「假如這種物質在聯合國侵人歐陸之前已經準備好了」，貝克說，「八千名兵士就不會進醫院了；，皮革加上空帶能够保護戰塲中的脚」。</p>
<p>平民已經繼承了這稱爲武裝隊伍而製的秘密武器的享用。這將賜給人類更大的健康和快樂。（譯自本年二月份雜誌文摘）</p>

It is reported that the first batch of supervisory personnel will be personally led by General Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, to depart this week to inspect the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] Minister Bai is scheduled to arrive in Zhenjiang from Nanjing before the first of next month, leading a group of more than ten key members of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area Supervisory Group. Various agencies in the provincial capital are already preparing a grand welcome.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong is scheduled to accompany Minister Bai to inspect the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] It is learned that the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area Supervisory Group will stay in Zhenjiang for a short time before departing for the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu, holding a symposium with representatives from all sectors to hear reports from political, military, and party officials. According to the opinions of general public representatives, the timing coincides with the general assembly of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council.

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 28th] It is reported that Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense will come to Jinan within ten days to inspect. The battle situation in Southern Shandong will rapidly unfold with Minister Bai's northern arrival and Hao Pengju's acceptance of the government's appointment.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, flew to Xuzhou on the 28th to inspect.</p>
<h3>Hao Pengju to go to Xuzhou Today for Instructions; Seven Counties Designated for His Department's Defense Zone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Hao Pengju, leading his more than 20,000 troops, assumed the new position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Area and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Group Army, appointed by the National Government on the 27th, causing extreme panic and unease among the Communist army. Hao was originally scheduled to come to Xuzhou on the 28th for instructions but changed it to the 29th, departing from Haizhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xinpu, 27th] Hao Pengju, who defected and surrendered, arrived in Xinpu by car from Baozhuang at 2:30 PM on the 27th. All sectors held a grand welcome ceremony and hosted a banquet to welcome Hao. He returned to his original location by car at 5:00 PM. The Ministry of National Defense appointed Hao Pengju as Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Area and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Group Army. The defense zone includes seven counties: Ju County, Mengcheng, Linyi, and Rizhao.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Hao Pengju's department's defection, the CCP office in Nanjing stated that they had not yet received this telegram and did not deny it. They did not express any opinion on Hao's public statement as reported in the newspaper.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] After the news of Hao Pengju's defection spread, the situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area took a sharp turn. It is reported that a division of Hao's troops, after defeating a part of the Communist army on the northern side of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, is now joining forces with two other National Army units, advancing rapidly towards Tancheng on the Shandong border. The Communist army in Tancheng is now preparing to retreat hastily towards the Taierzhuang-Zaozhuang branch line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 28th] After Hao Pengju's troops defected, they are now concentrating their main forces, preparing to attack Linyi, to destroy the Communist army's stronghold in Southern Shandong. Chen Yi is extremely panicked, drawing troops to defend. Furthermore, the National Army, which recovered Pi County, continued to advance on the 27th, reaching the line from Goushangji to the west of Yishui. The Communist army fled north in a panic.</p>
<h3>Bloody Fighting for Two Days and Nights; Single County Garrison Broke Through Yesterday; Communist Army's Feigned Pincer Offensive Against Xuzhou Remains Ineffective</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Over 10,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's Communist army in Western Shandong besieged Single County. The garrison fought bloody battles for two days and nights and broke through this morning, shifting positions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Over 3,000 Communist troops attacked the Dragon King Temple, twenty miles southeast of Single County, on the night of the 25th. The National Army is intercepting and attacking. Furthermore, there are no major Communist troops disrupting the central section of the Jiaoji Railway. Only Li Feng's independent battalion of 400-500 Communist troops are active within the Shandong border.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 28th] As the Communist army launched another pincer offensive against Xuzhou, the prelude to the battle centered on Xuzhou has officially begun. The Communist army is still using Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng as the eastern and western pincers, but unfortunately, these two pincers have never achieved the effect of a coordinated attack. When Chen Yi fiercely attacked the Lin-Zao-Tai branch line, Liu Bocheng was held back by the National Army outside Jinxiang and could not escape south to spy on the Longhai Railway. Although Liu Bocheng has now approached the edge of the Longhai Railway, Chen Yi has been forced by the National Army's flanking maneuvers to stretch his main force from the Lin-Zao-Tai branch line towards the coast, expanding the front to 500 li. The battlefield is developing in a "centrifugal" direction, and the Communist army's two pincers are opening wider and wider. Strategically, the Communist army is already at a disadvantage. Tactically, the Communist army still relies on using a few to control the many and using the many to annihilate the few. In combat, they believe in their inhumane concept of using human waves to fill the sea of fire. Since the National Army's two forces in Northern Jiangsu and Southern Shandong joined forces, they have devised countermeasures for this.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Liu Bocheng's Communist troops in Western Shandong are actively fleeing and attacking near the Longhai Railway, intending to cut off the Bian-Xu transportation to threaten Xuzhou. Currently, about 10,000 Communist troops have fled to the north of Jieshan and near Single County. Their advance troops, about a regiment, have reached ten kilometers north of Dangshan. Furthermore, 3,000-4,000 Communist troops were discovered twenty kilometers west of Feng County. Another Communist army force of two columns fled to the east and west sides of Minquan on the 27th, threatening to besiege Minquan. The National Army there is on high alert.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] More than a thousand Communist troops who fled from the north destroyed the nearby railway and destroyed a large bridge. Transportation in the area is temporarily cut off.</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Observer Discusses the Battle Situation in Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 28th] The focus of the national war has clearly shifted to Southern Shandong. The so-called exaggerated decisive victories of the Communist army in Yixian, Chengwu, Zaozhuang, and other places have aroused widespread concern among the people of the country about the war in that area. For this reason, this reporter specially visited a military observer. According to the discussion, after withdrawing from Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army launched attacks on the National Army in three parts: (1) Using the regular troops withdrawn from Northern Jiangsu in conjunction with the original troops in Southern Shandong and the Fourth and Ninth Divisions in Central Shandong to launch fierce attacks on the line east of Lin, Zao, Yi, Tai, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in Xin'an Town. (2) Using the elite troops of Liu Bocheng's troops in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border area to launch a comprehensive advance in the Southwestern Shandong area, including Heze, Dingtao, Chengwu, and Jinxiang. (3) Using Zhang Taisheng's troops in the Su-Wan-Yu border area to harass Yongcheng, Boxian, and Guoyang, their entire attempt is to consolidate Southern Shandong and rebuild the Southwestern Shandong base, gradually damaging the Longhai eastern section of traffic, re-enter Northern Jiangsu, and further threaten Xuzhou. For more than half a month since the war began, the National Army has been restricted by the ceasefire order, and the military has been in a passive and defensive position everywhere. Except for the Communist army in the Su-Wan-Yu border area, which once occupied Guoyang, which was immediately recovered by the National Army, but still divided into attacks on Yongcheng and Luyi, on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Yixian and Zaozhuang successively fell, and Lincheng and Taierzhuang were surrounded. West of the railway, south of the Yellow River, the entire Southwestern Shandong, except for Jinxiang, Juye, Heze, Jiaxiang, Yutai, Dingtao, Dan, Cao and other eight county towns are still in our hands, and the rest have been occupied by the Communist army one after another. In summary, in the Southern Shandong decisive battle that has just begun, although the Communist army slightly gained a small advantage in the early stage, this is by no means a victory that determines the overall battle situation as the Communist army has publicized. Furthermore, the Communist army recently transferred two divisions of the Democratic Allied Army and an artillery regiment from the Northeast to land in Yantai, and continued to transfer troops south from Jin, Ji, and Cha, which shows the weight of their past sacrifices and that the real decisive battle period will be within the next few months, and the Communist army's blind faith in force and strict rejection of peace talks will inevitably lead to a repeat of the Changchun and Siping Street battles, and they will suffer the consequences and only make the people suffer.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Among Communist Troops Transported to Yantai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao, 28th] The Lutao troops of the Fourth Army of the Communist Northeast Democratic Allied Army have been transported from Dalian to Yantai.

<h3>French Troops Landing on the Xisha Islands: We Have Lodged a Protest with France; The Vietnamese and French Authorities Claim the Islands Belong to France</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Nanjing, 28th] According to reliable sources: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with French Ambassador to China Merillon regarding the landing of French troops on the Xisha Islands. At the same time, Chinese Ambassador to France Qian Tai has also sent a similar note to the French government. French sources here refused to comment on this, saying only that the protest lodged by China is currently under study.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Saigon, 27th] The French authorities here recently issued a statement to the press regarding the dispute over the Xisha Islands, saying: France had already prepared to occupy the islands two months ago, but the dispatch of ships was repeatedly delayed until now due to bad sea weather. The French warship "Tonkinois," which sailed from Toulon, carried a small number of troops. Part of them were ordered to land on Pattle Island, and the rest landed on Woody Island. The above two islands have military barracks, wharves, and weather stations built by the French army in 1938, which shows that sovereignty belongs to France. The "Tonkinois" arrived at Woody Island on the 17th of this month and learned that Chinese troops were stationed on the island. The French commander then informed the commander of the Chinese troops that this was French territory and that the Chinese troops had no right to be stationed on the island. The French troops were then ordered to re-land, and after anchoring near the island for 24 hours, they transported a part of the troops to Pattle Island to land on the 19th, and found that no one was stationed on the island. Official sources here also said that before the "Tonkinois" sailed to the Xisha Islands, Chinese newspapers carried news of a military occupation, but the French side sent planes to reconnaissance and did not see any traces of Chinese troops occupying the islands. Furthermore, the French Marines landed on the Xisha Islands in May last year, stayed for fifteen days, and did not encounter any Chinese.</p>

<h3>Accomplice of Pierson Scheduled to Go to Trial Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 28th] In the case of the rape of Peking University student Shen Chong by the American soldier Pierson, the first defendant Pierson was already tried and convicted by the American military court. The second defendant will go to trial on the 30th of this month, but the name of the defendant will not be announced before the indictment.

In addition, he will be charged with assaulting the female student. According to Shen Chong's testimony in court, the second American soldier held her legs when Pierson raped her.</p>

The Baoding-Shijiazhuang section is now completely in the hands of the Communist army.

<h3>English Translation of China's Destiny</h3>
<p>MacMillan Edition is the Authorized Edition; Zhang Pingqun Issues Statement in the United States</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 27th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul in New York, recently issued a statement to American readers regarding the English translation of Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny," stating that: The only authorized English translation of Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny" has been published by MacMillan in New York. In view of the fact that another bookstore has also published another English translation with the same title, and includes "Another work by Chairman Chiang, entitled "Chinese Economic Theory," I must inform the general readers that all other English translations except the English translation published by MacMillan have not been agreed or authorized by the author. Regarding the so-called Chinese Economic Theory translation, there has never been such a work published in China. The one that is barely similar to this work is only a private record of the outline of the progress of Chinese economic thought given by the Chairman to a research group when discussing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood ten years ago. This article was only used as reference material and was never published. This painting has not been seen in other translations, so the above-mentioned translations, except for the one published by MacMillan, cannot be regarded as representing the author's true opinions, so readers should beware of misstatements and inaccuracies.</p>

Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, submitted a letter of thanks on behalf of Chairman Chiang, stating in the letter: "American industrialists training Chinese students in production technology in the United States not only helps China solve the problem of reconstruction, but also deepens the friendship arising from this work, enhancing understanding and cooperation between the two countries. China currently desperately needs men and women with modern technical training, and we hope this training work can continue." Ambassador Gu also expressed this hope. Former Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces in China (now Commander of the Second US Army), General Albert Coady Wedemeyer, continued, "I have great faith in China's future. Chinese industrial learning technology is very agile." Wedemeyer continued to call on the United States to continue to assist China's rehabilitation and reconstruction. Robertson, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the recipient of the thanks, said, "Westinghouse will help China establish an electrified industry and can train 300 Chinese students to learn modern American manufacturing technology." Mallory, President of the China Institute in America, said in his welcoming speech, "The China Institute in America has been invited to be the host because it is non-political, and the Chinese government and people recognize that it has a significant responsibility to promote good and beneficial relations between China and the United States." Those invited today included some of the most famous figures in American industry and commerce, as well as He Yingqin, Guo Taiqi, General Jin Kai, former New York Mayor Lehman, and Lu Zuofu.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Original Letter of Thanks</p>

The full text is as follows: "On behalf of the Chinese government, I am pleased to thank you and the members of your organizations for your cooperation in training personnel selected by our country during the war to study production technology in the United States. Thanks to the efforts of the US State Department and the China Institute in America, you and other American industrialists and businessmen have contributed more to assisting our country in completing huge construction projects than you may realize. Moreover, friendship best promotes understanding and cooperation between our two countries, and this project will soon have this effect. Now that the wartime training program has come to an end, I sincerely hope that this important task can be continued by other means. China urgently needs men and women trained in modern technology, and as we face the important years ahead, we sincerely hope for the assistance of the United States."</p>

<h3>Peace Talks Have No Hope of Resumption, Wu Tiecheng Visits Leaders of Both Parties</h3>
<p>The Democratic Socialist Party Reaches a Consensus on Joining the Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing and met with Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party for courtesy visits. When reporters visited Wu's private residence yesterday and inquired about the current situation, he said: "The government has never given up its efforts for peace talks, but since the CCP has firmly rejected this, there is no hope of resumption for the time being. The reorganization of the government is actively underway according to plan and should be realized in the short term."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lei Zhen visited Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party yesterday morning to exchange views on the reorganization of the government. Li Huang left after a short stay, and the rest continued to talk, but the content is unknown. According to Zuo Shunsheng to reporters afterward: "The conversation was not specific, and the reorganization of local governments and the selection of government personnel were not discussed. As for the rumors that the Youth Party has submitted a list of participants in the government, this is 'deliberate propaganda, absolute rumors.'" After Lei Zhen left Zuo's residence, he went to visit Zhang Junmai, and they met.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party continued to meet yesterday to discuss matters related to joining the government. According to spokesperson Sun Baoyi to reporters: "The opinions of the participants are very close, and a general agreement has been reached. There are still one or two minor details that will be decided at today's meeting. The content of all resolutions will be notified to Secretary-General Lei Zhen, who has been dispatched to Shanghai. A declaration on the current situation has been decided not to be issued, because it is deeply felt that the crisis of the previous month cannot be resolved by empty meetings. The government's intention to reorganize and reform is very sincere, and in principle, the prerequisites for the Democratic Socialist Party to participate in the government have been accepted. In terms of government reorganization, from the government's perspective, it is actually difficult to proceed simultaneously from the central to the local levels. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Sun believes that it is impossible to proceed under the current situation, and the reorganization of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference does not close the door to peace. The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly to formulate a constitution, whether in opposition or in power, will definitely support and endorse the work of constitutional governance."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to continue its meeting at 3:00 pm today (29th) to discuss the basic principles of the party's participation in the government and the detailed methods of government reorganization. The final decisions will be made today, and the results of the meeting will be formed into concrete opinions and handed over to Lei to take to Nanjing. According to relevant sources: "The internal opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party on participating in the government have become consistent. The meetings in recent days have focused on studying various issues of how to reform politics, so as to ensure that the promotion of constitutional government will be unimpeded after the coalition government is realized." It is also heard that the Democratic Socialist Party will ask the government to present a reorganization plan as a basis for negotiation.</p>
<p>Democratic League Has No Intention of Mediating Peace</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter visited Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League yesterday and asked whether the Democratic League is currently preparing to mediate peace. He replied: "It is still too early. The government has not expressed anything to the Democratic League. Although Chairman Chiang said to the Democratic League personnel in Nanjing, 'The government does not close the door to peace, and hopes that the Democratic League will make more efforts,' there are no concrete measures. The Democratic League is currently holding some internal meetings. The Democratic League hopes to achieve peace as soon as possible, but the current reorganization of the government will increase the difficulty of reopening peace talks."</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Tax-Exempt Counties and Cities, Ministry of Finance Decides on Standards, 20 Billion Yuan to Be Allocated First in Five Grades</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Finance has decided on the standards for subsidizing tax-exempt counties and cities in the pacification zone. As the disaster situation in the recovered counties and cities in the pacification zone is serious, in addition to the inability to collect land taxes, the national treasury will provide appropriate monthly subsidies. The standards are: (1) For all recovered counties and cities, the province should apply to the central government for exemption from the current year's land tax if the disaster situation is indeed serious. The number of counties exempt from tax in each province should not exceed 80% of the total tax amount of each recovered county and city. (2) All recovered counties and cities will be subsidized according to the county level (1st to 5th grade). (3) The amount of monthly subsidies will decrease in stages, with three months as a period, starting from the date of recovery and ending at the end of the tax-exempt year of the 35th year of the Republic of China. (4) For partially recovered counties and cities, the national treasury will allocate one-quarter of the standard amount for the recovered counties to the provincial government for overall distribution. (5) Recovered counties and cities should selectively carry out various autonomous undertakings to the extent of their financial resources and should not impose arbitrary levies. Other undertakings that should be carried out should be done when the locality has legal income. (6) In addition to the statutory taxes and levies that should be levied in appropriate amounts, recovered counties and cities should follow legal procedures if special taxes are to be levied. The Ministry of Finance has now issued an emergency order based on the above six standards and will allocate 20 billion yuan first, and then verify and allocate the funds after determining the recovered areas, counties, and grades. The subsidy standards are divided into five grades: 153.2 million yuan for first-grade counties, 130 million yuan for second-grade counties, 110 million yuan for third-grade counties, 95 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 80 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The funds will be allocated in four installments, with three months as a period. The first installment will be 60 million yuan for first-grade counties, 50 million yuan for second-grade counties, 40 million yuan for third-grade counties, 35 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 30 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The second installment will be 43.2 million yuan for first-grade counties, 40 million yuan for second-grade counties, 35 million yuan for third-grade counties, 30 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 25 million yuan for fifth-grade counties.

<h3>Difficulties in the Transportation Office of the Third District Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Director Reports to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 28th] Ma Junxian, Director of the Transportation Office of the Third District Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, recently hosted reporters and reported on the business, saying: "The office is responsible for the operation of the highways in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces, with districts in Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hengyang, Liuzhou, Zhanjiang, and Xingning, with a total of 716 vehicles, of which 64% were received from the enemy and puppet regimes. A total of 154 vehicles are distributed in Guangdong Province. The office has recently counted a total of 5,370 tons of freight and 763,470 passengers in the past three months, accounting for one-seventh of the national transportation volume." Ma also stated the difficulties of the office's business, saying: "The security of each route is poor, merchants and travelers are insufficient, and the highways are too damaged, making the parts easy to damage. Especially the transportation lines in the wood district have railway and waterway competition. For example, although the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway has been completed, it takes 11 hours from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, while the train takes only 3 hours and the plane takes only 40 minutes, so the highway has no way to compete. To overcome this difficulty, we will handle intermodal transportation between highways, railways, and waterways in various places."</p>
<h3>Twelve Executive Headquarters Sailing Vessels Encountered Bandits on the Way from Guangzhou to Beihai County, All Supplies and More Than 100 Personnel Missing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Executive Headquarters authorities recently received an unfortunate and shocking news. Twelve sailing vessels of the Executive Headquarters were carrying relief supplies from Guangzhou to Beihai County, Guangdong in September last year. On the way, they encountered bandits, and all 250 tons of supplies on board and more than 100 Executive Headquarters staff were missing. After receiving the report, the Guangdong Provincial authorities sent patrols to search nearby, but there is still no news. A hurricane occurred in the South China Sea at that time, and pirates took advantage of the wind to rob. Some ships may have encountered risks or been robbed. The Guangdong Provincial authorities believe that banditry often occurs near the Leizhou Peninsula, affecting the safety of passing ships, and have sent police to suppress them. However, the living conditions of the local residents have always been very difficult, resulting in some people being forced by livelihood to take risks. The Executive Headquarters has now allocated a large amount of supplies to relieve the local residents, and the number of beneficiaries before and after has reached about 100,000.</p>
<h3>The Scope of the UNRRA Organization in China to Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[This City] There are varying rumors about the deadline for the UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters to end. It is learned that all UNRRA organizations in Europe are scheduled to end in March this year, and the Asian part is scheduled to end in June this year, while the entire end of the Executive Headquarters organization will be in September of this autumn. The UNRRA China Branch is scheduled to reduce its scope in March this spring, and the shipment of UNRRA relief supplies to China will end at the end of June, but after March this year, the scope of the UNRRA organization in China will be smaller than it is now. It is estimated that the number of UNRRA staff in China is as many as 1,200 to 1,300 people, and there are 700 to 800 people in Shanghai alone, while the number of staff in the national organizations of the Executive Headquarters is more than 15,000 people. (The news of the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, scheduled to be held at 9:00 am today (29th), can be found in yesterday's issue of this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>The Nantong Corruption Case, the Chief of the 13th District Is the Most Suspected, Huang Qiming Is on the Run and Being Wanted</h3>
<p>[Nantong Correspondence] Regarding the case of the 13th district of Nantong County embezzling bandit relics and apportioning cotton, involving Ji Fang, the county magistrate of the county, after the Su Province government received a telegram from Commander Li Moyan of the Pacification Zone, Chairman Wang immediately proposed a meeting of the provincial government and resolved to dismiss Yang Fang. At the same time, he secretly sent Mi Shi from the Department of Construction to Nantong to thoroughly investigate and transfer the entire case to the judiciary for handling, and ordered Yang Fang to surrender to the headquarters for interrogation. At this time, Yang Fang came to the province, and the provincial police bureau was immediately ordered to strictly monitor him and not allow him to leave without permission. During the process, all circles in the provincial capital paid great attention to the development of the case, and there was a rumor that Yang Fang had absconded with bail, which led to the punishment of Chuan Zhaoren, the director of the provincial police bureau responsible for monitoring, and Liu Chunyang, a major staff member of the security headquarters, who acted as a guarantor. After inquiring from all parties, the reporter learned that after the Bird Association Police Bureau was ordered to monitor Yang Fang, it found Yang at Liu Chunyang's residence and monitored him. Liu, because Yang was a close friend, strongly guaranteed that he would not leave the case and provided a written guarantee. The police bureau took the liberty of signing and submitting a request to the provincial government for approval and ordered him to continue to be responsible for monitoring, but Yang was no longer in the residence. Although it was said that he had gone to meet relatives and friends and would return soon, there was still some favoritism. After receiving the report, the provincial government severely reprimanded the person in charge of the police bureau and ordered Yang Fang to surrender by a deadline. Liu Chunyang was placed under investigation for privately guaranteeing the monitored person, which was purely a matter of responsibility. When Yang Fang surrendered himself after the matter was over, Liu was also released from custody. It is now heard that Commander Li has sent the case files and other documents to the province, and it is heard that Huang Qiming, the chief of the 13th district of Nantong, is the most suspected in this case, and has fled without a trace after the case was discovered. The provincial government has issued an arrest warrant for him. Before he is arrested, Yang is still necessary to be sent to the court for investigation and interrogation first. The provincial government has sent the police bureau chief to personally lead the police and comrades with the entire case file to the Suzhou High Court and reported the progress to Commander Li and reported to the central government.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Population and Commodity Index Showed Signs of Decline Last Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] The Hong Kong Entry and Exit Department recently used the wholesale price index of goods in 1938 as a comparison base to create the wholesale convenience index of goods in 1941 and 1946. The food category in 1941 was 15.4 and in 1946 it was 708.95. The textile category in 1941 was 138.3 and in 1946 it was 769.25.

Observing these figures, the wholesale price of food last year was seven times that of 1938, textiles were seven and a half times, metal and minerals were three times, and miscellaneous goods were six times. However, compared with the various indexes in the second half of last year, they all showed signs of decline, which indicates that the wholesale price of imported goods is gradually decreasing, and it is expected that the price of goods this year will tend to decrease further.</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Tani Hisao Case Completed, Corpses of Victims Exhumed, Piles of White Bones on Yuhuatai Hillside Are Shocking</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense has been opening a temporary investigation court at the District Office of the 11th District outside Zhonghua Gate since the 25th of this month, summoning the family members of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. More than 100 people went to testify every day, and the last investigation court was opened on the 28th, and the number of people who testified was even more crowded, reaching more than 180 people. Chief Judge Shi Meiyu personally presided over the investigation every day, divided into three courts for interrogation, from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm. According to Chief Judge Shi to reporters: "The work of investigating witnesses has basically come to an end. More than 600 people have come to testify in recent days, all of whom are civilians living in the Zhonghua Gate area, which shows that the long-term enemy army massacre was the most tragic in this area. According to the records of the Nanjing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society regarding the burial of corpses, the burial team of the association buried more than 40,000 corpses in this area, which were buried near Yuhuatai Hillside. A large tomb behind the District Office of the 11th District, buried more than 2,000 corpses. The family members of the victims collected the bodies by themselves, or the more than 5,000 victims in the ordnance factory were first massacred and then burned, and there were no corpses to collect, which is not included." The Chief Judge, at about 1:00 pm on the 28th, accompanied by citizens and the person in charge of the former Red Cross Society who handled the burial of the victims, went to the back mountain of the District Office of the 11th District to exhume the corpses of the victims. In just one moment, more than ten skeletons were seen. According to nearby residents: "There are more than 400 corpses in the common tomb, all of whom are innocent civilians who did not have time to hide when the Japanese invaders entered the city." The tomb is divided into upper and lower layers, all of which were buried by the Red Cross after the victims were killed. It is heard that Shi also plans to allocate more civilians to exhume the corpses on the morning of the 29th, and concentrate all the excavated skeletons to be presented as evidence during the public trial of the Tani Hisao criminal on the 6th of next month, so as to avoid the criminal's cunning denial.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Analysis of the German Problem</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference in London, active discussions have begun on the German peace treaty. Not only have the relevant countries, especially the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland, etc., put forward their demands on Germany, but the opinions on the German issue also differ between Britain and the United States and France and the Soviet Union. This has caused great difficulties for the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference, and it cannot be said at this time whether it can complete its preparatory tasks for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Moscow on March 10. The German peace treaty is at the core of the European issue, which is related to the future safety of Europe. At the same time, the contents of the German peace treaty are an example for the Japanese peace treaty. Therefore, for the sake of European peace and for the sake of Far Eastern peace, we must pay special attention to the resolution of the German issue.</p>
<p>In order to accelerate the resolution of the German issue, the Soviet Union has submitted a procedural plan to the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference for the German peace treaty, dividing the work of drafting the German peace treaty into three stages: (1) After listening to the opinions of the relevant Allied countries, the four major powers draft a draft of the German peace treaty; (2) After the establishment of the German central government, convene a conference of the Allied countries to allow the German government to send representatives to the meeting to present their opinions, and then discuss the draft of the German peace treaty; (3) The four major powers determine the final terms of the German peace treaty, which are then signed by the countries, and then submitted to the governments of the Allied countries for approval, which will take effect.</p>
<p>It is not known what the views of the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France are on this proposal, but from these three procedures, it can be proved that the establishment of the German peace treaty is not easy. What's more, the opinions of the Allied countries are extremely inconsistent due to different interests and different positions. How to seek common ground while reserving differences in divergent opinions? And after seeking common ground, how to eliminate the small differences of various countries? These are all very serious issues.</p>
<p>The most important issues in the German peace treaty are: one is the total amount of German compensation and the method of payment; the other is how to control Germany? In the active aspect, it is necessary to re-educate the German people and eliminate the Nazi anesthesia and its residual poison suffered by the Germans, so that Germany can also become a peace-loving country and no longer pose a threat to European peace; in the passive aspect, it is also necessary to supervise Germany's military and economic disarmament, so that Germany will not be able to rise again and invade again in a few years. However, since Germany surrendered, it has been controlled by the Allied countries for nearly two years. As for the results of the control? Different people have different opinions. According to a report published by the International Research Association for European Issues, the work of eliminating the Nazis has completely failed in the past two years. Nazi remnants are still preserved in Germany under the control of the Allied countries, trying to use funds escaping abroad to help the future revival of the country. Although this report cannot be completely believed, it is worth pondering by the authorities responsible for controlling Germany. How to control Germany in the future to prevent the resurgence of German aggression? It is indeed necessary to discuss it at length.</p>
<p>Since the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and the closing of the Second United Nations General Assembly last year, although the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union has shown signs of improvement, opinions on many issues, especially the German peace treaty, have not yet been unified. When the Allied Control Council for Germany met on the 20th of this month, Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, delivered a speech at the meeting, accusing the representatives of Britain and the United States of obstructing the drafting of a joint report by the council, trying to prevent it from being drafted. Although the British official has denied this and expressed the view of the British government, which is also the same as Marshal Sokolovsky's opinion; however, the inconsistency of the German policy of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union can also be clearly demonstrated here. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press, U.S. Secretary of State Marshal will propose at the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in March to conclude a four-power alliance treaty prohibiting Germany from rearming for 40 years; it is difficult to predict at this time whether Marshal Ma's proposal will be adopted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>The treaty prohibiting Germany from rearming for 40 years was proposed a year ago by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Although Marshal Stalin also expressed his approval in principle, it was shelved invisibly due to the opposition of Foreign Minister Molotov. Now, Secretary of State Marshall is reviving the old issue. Although he has obtained the understanding of the Soviet diplomatic authorities in advance, and the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference agreed to include this four-power alliance treaty on the agenda of the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, whether it can be adopted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference and established will depend on the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. In all fairness, the four-power alliance treaty proposed by Marshal Ma is the best way to prevent the resurgence of German aggression.</p>
<p>In short, although the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference has encountered many obstacles in discussing the German issue, if the Four-Power Foreign Ministers can look ahead and take world peace as their priority, then any thorny issue can be easily resolved. Marshal Sokolovsky's accusations against Britain and the United States clearly show that the Soviet Union still lacks the spirit of mutual trust and mutual tolerance with Britain and the United States. Today, when the world is looking forward to the four powers cooperating to resolve the German issue as soon as possible, we cannot help but express our regret.</p>
<h3>Unusual Cold in North China, Freezing Outside Dagu Port, Heavy Snow and Traffic Obstruction in Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] According to the report of the North China Meteorological Observatory: Since the Siberian cold wave invaded North China, Beiping has been within the control area of this cold wave for several days, and the temperature has dropped sharply for several days. Last night, due to the clear sky, the radiation of heat from the ground increased, and the snow surface on the ground continued to expand and absorb the heat of the air. Therefore, the temperature dropped further, dropping to minus 19.5 degrees Celsius at 2:30 this morning. This low temperature continued for about an hour before gradually rising. Because the wind was extremely weak at that time, and it was in the middle of the night, people felt it slightly. This low degree has not been seen in Ping City in the past 20 years. Now the force of the cold wave is gradually weakening, and the temperature should rise slightly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Tianjin has been experiencing severe cold for several days, with a low temperature of minus 16.6 degrees Celsius, which is a rare cold in the past ten years. The sea outside Dagu Port is frozen for 30 nautical miles, which is the first time since mid-February 1936. Many ships have been frozen in, and are currently being rescued. The newly completed gate of Xingang has also been frozen and damaged. The port of Qinhuangdao has also been sealed, and more than ten ships cannot enter the port.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 28th] Heavy snow has fallen in the Xiangyang area of Northern Hubei. It has not stopped from the 19th to the 25th, and traffic is blocked, which is only seen in the past ten years.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] In order to develop the domestic silk industry, the China Sericulture Corporation is planning for spring silkworm loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year, with a planned loan amount of 30 billion yuan. In addition, the issue of Japanese cocoon transportation to China has been rumored in the market for several days. It is learned that last year, the China Sericulture Corporation proposed a barter method to Marshal Lai's headquarters to exchange our country's edible salt for Japan's surplus dried cocoons. At that time, the planned cocoon price was a stable US$1 per pound. By September of last year, Japan overturned the previous agreement and did not transport the surplus dried cocoons to China, and no result was achieved after repeated negotiations. It was only recently decided to sell 10 million pounds of dried cocoons to our country at a price of US$2.77 per pound, but the cost of each pound of raw silk on average requires at least 3.5 pounds of dried cocoons. The current market price of raw silk is only about US$6 to US$7 per pound. If each pound is valued at US$2.77 to produce raw silk, the cost of each pound of raw silk will exceed US$8, which is far from the current market price, and most of the domestic silk mills have recently suspended operations. Therefore, the issue of Japanese cocoon transportation to China is still difficult to expect.</p>
<h3>Conversations with Two Leaders of the Jiangsu High Court: A Summary of the Handling of Traitor Cases; Prosecution Office Accepted More Than 5,500 Cases; More Than 1,600 Cases Transferred to the Criminal Court</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 28th dispatch] This newspaper's reporter visited the two leaders of the Jiangsu High Court on the 28th to inquire about the statistics of handling traitor cases in 1946, and was informed that the Prosecution Office accepted more than 5,500 cases, of which 5,200 cases have been prosecuted or dismissed respectively, and only more than 350 cases are still under investigation. The Criminal Court accepted a total of 1,633 cases, all of which were transferred by the Prosecution Office after the investigation was concluded. Among them, 1,352 cases have been adjudicated separately, and the remaining 281 cases are being tried.</p>
<p>Confiscated Traitor Property to be Organized</p>
<p>According to Chief Prosecutor Han, the county governments in this province have separately checked the real estate of those suspected of being traitors in their respective jurisdictions. Up to now, more than 1,000 cases have been reported to this office, requesting instructions on disposal methods. However, although the owners of the real estate were reported by the county to have filled puppet positions, they did not send evidence of being traitors to the office for investigation, nor did they file a complaint with the office. According to law, they cannot be confiscated. Therefore, it is urgent to organize them. The steps decided are to first order the counties to submit concrete evidence of the crimes of the original owners of the confiscated real estate. If the investigation is true, it will be transferred to the Criminal Court for trial and judgment. If the confiscation is abnormal, it should be returned to protect property rights. The reporter then asked that if the traitors who are at large cannot be brought to justice, will the confiscated property remain in a state of detention, or will other disposal methods be determined? He replied that according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, the property of traitors who are at large after being wanted originally had the stipulation of being confiscated by a special division, but there is no precedent for doing so. Therefore, this office has now submitted a special case to the Ministry of Justice for explanation.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 28th dispatch] Hui Ni Bingshi, who had served as the head of the police training center of the puppet Wuxian Special Bureau, was previously pronounced not guilty and released by the First Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court. The public opinion in Muyi was in an uproar, and the prosecutor also refused to accept it and filed an appeal. He was once reported to the Control Yuan, alleging that the personnel handling the case were derelict in their duties. Therefore, all circles in Suzhou are extremely concerned about the outcome of this case. Now the Supreme Court has ruled to overturn the verdict of innocence and returned it to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. The Criminal Court has now scheduled to summon Hui Ni for retrial on February 7.</p>

<h3>A Puppet Secret Agent in Wuxi Still Carries a Gun and Runs Wild, Captured by the County Government</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Wuxi dispatch] Xu Yunsheng, a resident of Wuxi, served as a liaison officer and intelligence agent in enemy and puppet organizations such as the Liaison Office during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, he has not had a proper occupation. Recently, he often carries a handgun and specializes in extortion. A Chinese and Western medicine doctor, Cao Chunnian, was extorted 500,000 yuan in Taosha Lane a few days ago. The day before yesterday, Xu went to the Oriental Garden Hotel in Tongxiang Bridge and stayed in the room overnight. The tea attendant, Tang Aquan, was asked to provide a guarantee and collect the room fee. Xu used a gun to shoot a hole in his head. After the incident, someone reported it to the Criminal Police Team of the County Government. Captain Wang Yiming sent personnel to arrest Xu, and both the person and the gun were taken to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bandit Alert in Chenmu Township, Repelled After Two Hours of Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] Around the Lunar New Year, the wind of theft was rampant in the four townships of Suzhou, and cases were frequently reported. At 10 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Zhou Siguan, a habitual bandit from Chenmu Town, led more than 50 people, carrying various long and short guns, on small boats, trying to land and plunder. Fortunately, the sentry police discovered and reported the alarm, and the garrison police, together with the local self-defense team, launched a head-on attack.

<h3>A Huge Mansion in Gusu Destroyed by Fire Due to Careless Worship During New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] A huge Chinese-style house at No. 41 Weidao Guanlong, Pingjiang Road, Suzhou, is the old residence of the Pan family, a large family in Suzhou. It has four courtyards inside and outside, with more than 40 rooms. It also has gardens, flower pavilions, bridges, and study rooms. The structure is exquisite and has always been praised by the people of Suzhou. At about 3 a.m. on Lunar New Year's Eve, the residents were awakened from their sleep due to the uncleaned ashes of the offerings to the heavens, causing a fire. They were unable to save anything and only escaped with their lives. By the time the fire brigades from various districts arrived to put out the fire, the fire had spread uncontrollably. As a result, 18 rooms in the second, third, and fourth courtyards of the house, as well as flower pavilions and large halls, were burned to the ground. The fire was extinguished at about 6 a.m. The losses are huge and difficult to estimate for the time being.</p>

Since the Lunar New Year, three money shops have opened one after another, namely Tongyu Money Shop, Henglong Money Shop, and Dacheng Money Shop. Since the victory in Shi, only Jinyuan Money Shop has established an office. The establishment of these three shops this time has greatly helped the industrial and commercial sectors.

In addition, the Bank of China, the Local Bank, and the Farmers Bank have all established offices in Stone.</p>
<h3>Four Unregistered Money Shops in Jiaxing, Including Tongyuan, Close Down</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Jiaxing dispatch] The four money shops in the urban area of Tongyuan, Jianxing, Dada, and Shengda were previously ordered to suspend operations by the County Government because their registration was not approved.

<h3>Pan En Ship Arrives in Hangzhou from Shanghai, Successful Trial Voyage at the Mouth of the Qiantang River</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th dispatch] The Pan En ship, a 222-ton vessel of the Executive Yuan, arrived safely at Sibao, Hangzhou City at 8:22 yesterday, setting a new record in the history of the Qiantang River. Due to the shallow water level at Zimen, Shanghai ships could not enter the Qiantang River. The ship and another auxiliary boat made six trial voyages from Shanghai, and finally entered the Qiantang River after much hardship. According to Captain Geng Pushan, if navigation signs are installed in the vicinity of Sancha and Shibao, and the water depth is measured at any time, then ships with a deadweight of 600 tons and a draft of 6 feet can enter and exit the Qiantang River at high tide without any problems. The ship is going to Tangshan to transport stone, and Hangzhou Mayor Zhou specially hosted a banquet.</p>
<h3>Changshu Strictly Pursues Those Who Resist Tax Payment, Large Grain Households Summoned and Taken into Custody to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Changshu dispatch] The collection of tax grain here to meet military needs has slightly improved after the Ministry and Provincial sent personnel to Changshu to supervise, but it has not yet reached the planned quota. According to the numbers reported by the offices of the various districts to the county, the results of the Liantang and Tangqiao districts are better, followed by the three districts of Zhitang, Shazhou, and Dongtang, the Chengguan and Meili districts are very different, and the Wushi district is the worst. The historians Qian Erxian and others who were taken into custody to urge collection have been released on bail. Large grain households who stubbornly resist will be summoned and taken into custody to pay taxes starting from the 27th, in order to report and resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>Surcharge for Late Payment of Land Tax Extended to March</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Jiaxing dispatch] The land tax collection in this county was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of January. If it is not paid within the time limit, a surcharge will be added from February 1. Now the surcharge period is approaching in an instant. The County Council believes that the collection of grain tax this time has been delayed in practice due to planting reasons. In addition, it has been raining continuously in recent days, and the fields are wet and unable to operate. Even if it is delivered, the collection office will refuse to accept it because the grain is wet and easy to damage. Moreover, the time limit is also at the beginning of the Lunar New Year, and farmers have the habit of enjoying themselves for several days. Therefore, the Council sent a telegram to the superior authorities to extend the collection period to February 1 to add a surcharge in order to help the people in need.</p>
<h3>Tense Tax Collection in Wuxing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Wuxing dispatch] The County Government received an urgent telegram from the Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the collection of land tax in 1946 is closely related to the supply of military grain, the finances of the province and county, the regulation of civil food in the coming year, and the stabilization of prices. Recently, it also received an order from the National Government to collect the full amount on time for military grain allocation as quickly as possible, so it should be expedited to complete the task. The annual land tax in the county must be collected in full by the end of January, and the bonus and penalty criteria are that those who exceed 90% will be rewarded with preferential treatment, and those who are less than 80% will be severely punished. Now that there are few days left until the deadline, all civil servants of the County Government and townships should be mobilized as soon as possible, cooperate with local gentry, and actively urge collection so as not to delay, etc. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Yuan ordered the townships to collect the full amount within the time limit without any delay, so as to emphasize the importance of orders.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Department of Jiahe Chutian Xu Postpones Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Mingguang dispatch] The Joint Defense Headquarters of the five counties of Jiahe Chutian Xu, under the Eighth Pacification Zone, recently received a telegram from Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, stating that the establishment of the Department has reached its expiration date, but due to the uncleared banditry, and the winter defense period, the Department will be extended by two months to facilitate suppression. Chen Kairong, Joint 指㮠 official, and Zhu Yuancai, Deputy 指㧓 official, have notified the county magistrates of Jiashan, Lai'an, Chuxian, Tianchang, and Xuyi.</p>
<h3>Henan Native Cloth Industry</h3>
<p>(This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch) The Ministry of Finance has stipulated the method of reducing or exempting the 食业 and 祝免 taxes for the sake of 식업. For all native cloths, whether spun by farmers by hand or manufactured by 工厂, those who sell them directly are exempt from tax, and it is scheduled to take effect from January 1947. As for the native cloth sales industry, except for those who pick up loads to sell, all others should be taxed uniformly. The food industry will continue to be exempted for one year from October last year to the end of September 1947. Since the preparation situation in the transportation industry has gradually returned to normal, it will continue to be taxed in accordance with regulations. Henan Province is a cotton producing area. Most of the cotton produced each year is spun by farmers by hand, except for foreign exchange. Therefore, the native cloth weaving industry in southern Henan has always been very developed. After the victory, it declined due to the impact of prices, which was a major blow to the rural areas. According to people in the native cloth industry, now that the government has explicitly stipulated that native cloth weaving is tax-free, if it can be improved, improved, and the cost reduced, it can restore its past glory.</p>
<h3>Minhang Town Plans to Organize a Cooperative</h3>

It is heard that a general meeting of members will be convened soon to begin organizing.</p>
<h3>Economic Hardship Fully Exposed During Suzhou's Lunar New Year: 20-30% of Businesses Bankrupt</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Following Suzhou's ingrained customs, the emphasis remains on the old year. The sounds of firecrackers have not ceased in all directions these past few days. Shops are closed, and residents brave rain and snow to visit and offer New Year greetings. The streets are filled with sightseers. Government offices are effectively on holiday, entertainment venues are thriving, and gambling is also rampant. However, due to the influence of high-interest loans and excessively heavy taxes, coupled with substantial expenses, high costs, stable prices, and the public's weak purchasing power, the 500 million yuan industrial and commercial loan is a mere drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Approximately 20-30% of businesses have tragically declared bankruptcy. Last spring, due to the government's crackdown on underground banks, unregulated mutual aid societies flourished everywhere. Ultimately, because the methods of bidding lacked a foundation of trust, and the funds acquired could not generate normal profits, it was like drinking poison to quench thirst. People were passing around the "poison," and as the year's end approached, poverty was fully exposed. In teahouses everywhere, people were demanding repayment of already-dissolved association funds, creating a noisy atmosphere devoid of smiles. Even during the New Year, sounds of scolding and quarreling could still be heard in the streets, fully revealing the hardship of the social economy.</p>
<p>Those who only earn commissions by acting as agents for buying and selling can barely manage, but they are few in number. Consequently, the number of bankrupt and closed businesses is remarkably high. Statistics show that dozens of businesses throughout the city have ceased operations, an unprecedented situation.</p>
<h3>The Scenery in Songjiang During the Spring Festival is also Desolate</h3>
<p>[Our Songjiang Dispatch] Since the Lunar New Year, Taiyi County has experienced continuous rain and snow, leading to a bleak market situation. Even the most bustling Yue Temple market is deserted. The overall scene is nothing like it used to be. In the commercial sector, losses far outweigh profits, resulting in business closures across various industries, including silk fabrics, oil, pastries, water tobacco, grain, dried goods, meat, and local produce. All have reported losses. Banks and money houses have also found it impossible to make a profit due to high expenses. Only the brewing, paper goods, incense, and traditional Chinese medicine industries have seen profits. Soap, cigarettes, and Western medicine businesses are doing averagely. As for the rice and grain businesses...</p>
<h3>Suzhou Celebrity Extortion Case: Granted Amnesty, Trial Halted</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The famous extortion case involving celebrity Fan Junbo, which had captured public attention, has been halted. After the county court prosecutor's office filed a public prosecution, the criminal court conducted a public trial. However, following the promulgation of the amnesty decree and because the case fell within the scope of the amnesty, the criminal court has decided to halt the trial and issue a dismissal of the charges. Furthermore, another case involving suspicion of corruption by Fan Junbo was investigated by Prosecutor Sun, who concluded that there was insufficient evidence of wrongdoing and has decided not to prosecute.</p>
<h3>Local News from Various Places</h3>

However, nearby residents were greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Changshu News: Due to substantial losses, the newspapers here, originally scheduled to resume publication on the 27th after the Spring Festival holiday, have failed to do so. They are separately convening meetings to discuss solutions, hoping to resume publication soon.</p>

<p>Hai Ning News: To facilitate price evaluation, alleviate the burden on the County Chamber of Commerce, and serve the business community, the Township Chief initiated the formation of a town chamber of commerce.

<p>Water Shortage in Daxu Lane</p>
<p>Daxu Lane on Roberts Road is not particularly remote, yet access to tap water is very difficult. Most of the residents work in factories, and there is crowding when fetching water and washing rice, which wastes valuable time. Although there is well water available in the lane, it is muddy and unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, I request that the Public Works Bureau quickly improve the situation. (Yang Jiemin)</p>
<p>Requests for Cleanliness on Changshou Road</p>
<p>I am a junior high school student, and I must pass through the intersection of Wohua Road and Changshou Road every day on my way to school. However, two weeks ago, a large pile of garbage suddenly accumulated at this intersection. At the time, I thought that the Sanitation Bureau might be temporarily storing it here because they were unable to move it in time. But to this day, not only has the garbage not been removed, but it has accumulated more and more, taking up a large portion of the road. This area is a necessary route for workers leaving nearby factories. It is not only inconvenient to walk but also the stench is unbearable and harmful to health. There are also many dead babies' coffins discarded on top of the pile. I ask the sanitation authorities to pay attention. (A Reader from the Western District)</p>
<p>Views on Elected District Chiefs</p>
<p>With the promulgation of the Constitution, the whole country rejoiced. To realize a democratic system, there is the election of district chiefs, which is the initial step in returning power to the people. The heads of Baojia, as representatives of the people, share the joys and sorrows of the masses, and people of high moral character and reputation should be carefully selected to fill these positions. As for the existing heads of Baojia in the city, some held false positions during the enemy puppet regime. After the victory, they continued to maintain their position and still behaved in the same old way, arbitrarily exercising power. The public should expose them, and the authorities should thoroughly eliminate them to achieve lasting peace, lay the foundation for self-governance, promote democracy, and not let them do as they please. As far as I can see, I dare to express my humble opinion, hoping to help cleanse the soil. (Xia Shoufu)</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Resigns En Masse: Shigeru Yoshida to be Commissioned to Form New Coalition Cabinet; Nationwide Demonstrations Held Yesterday to Overthrow the Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Shigeru Yoshida Cabinet has resigned en masse. Yoshida will be commissioned to form a new coalition cabinet. The formal announcement is expected to be made at 2 PM today.</p>
<p>[Kaizo News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida decided that a coalition cabinet could be formed. Today, he is determined to convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting and implement a mass resignation after the Socialist Party expresses its final stance. However, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama stated today that the government has not formally or informally expressed any intention to the Socialist Party. Regarding the issue of a coalition government, the Socialist Party insists on changing Finance Minister Ishibashi's financial policy. The establishment of a new regime must be jointly negotiated by the Liberal, Progressive, Socialist, Cooperative, and National parties. These points are absolutely non-negotiable. If the government can accept the Socialist Party's proposals, the Socialist Party will gladly negotiate. Otherwise, the Liberal and Progressive parties should resolve the crisis themselves. The Liberal Party insists on keeping Finance Minister Ishibashi in office, so the Ishibashi issue has become a major obstacle to forming a coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>Approximately 400,000 People Participated in the Demonstration</p>
<p>[Kaizo News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] With the date for the planned strike by the Japanese labor sector, February 1st, fast approaching, and the Yoshida Cabinet tottering, the Cabinet Overthrow Implementation Committee and the Japan National Trade Union Joint Struggle Committee held "National Rallies to Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and Break Through the Crisis" across the country today. In Tokyo alone, approximately 400,000 members of the industrial associations, the General Federation of Labor, and the National Association of Public Servants gathered at the Imperial Palace Plaza at 11 AM. Kato Kanji, a leftist leader of the Socialist Party, was elected as the chairman of the rally. A representative of the National Public Servants Association stated in a speech that the Yoshida Cabinet had rejected their minimum demands. They must resolutely overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and move towards the establishment of a democratic people's government. They will strike on February 1st to achieve their goals. Communist leaders Tokuda Kyuichi and Nosaka Sanzo also delivered impassioned speeches. Starting at 1 PM, the entire procession began a demonstration march, passing by the Prime Minister's official residence and the Metropolitan Police Department, lasting for two hours. In Osaka, 150,000 people participated in the rally, carrying slogans such as "Oppose Harsh Taxes and Evil Laws," and marched through the city. In Nagoya, 50,000 people participated in the rally, starting the demonstration march at noon. In Kanagawa and Yokohama, 50,000 people participated in the rally, shouting slogans such as "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet," and marched through the city. In Kobe, 30,000 people participated in the rally, and after the meeting, they marched in demonstration. In Kyoto, 30,000 people participated in the rally, carrying a large flag with the words "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet," and marched through the city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Militarism Difficult to Eradicate Immediately</h3>
<p>Views of the Chief Advisor of Our Delegation to Japan</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Shen Jun, the chief advisor of the Chinese delegation to Japan, stated recently that the repatriation of Japanese soldiers is progressing smoothly "in form," but their militarism will be difficult to eradicate in the short term. Therefore, we still need to closely monitor whether the feudal traditions that are the roots of Japanese militarism can be thoroughly eliminated first. The Chinese delegation will cooperate in all aspects regarding Japan's disarmament and democratization, so that Japan can become a peaceful country, which will benefit Asia and the world. The recent claim by the Moscow newspaper that about 100 Japanese officers, with the consent of the Japanese authorities, will go to China to assist the Chinese government army is "pure fabrication." Furthermore, our delegation has no knowledge of the rumor that many Japanese officers, disguised as Chinese officers, are working in the Nanjing army. Secondly, regarding the situation in Japan, we should now investigate whether there are any demobilized soldiers infiltrating society. Today, the Japanese police department is employing many of these soldiers, which is a natural outlet for demobilized soldiers, but the consequences should also be noted. For example, the Shibuya incident last year, where police officers shot and killed six Taiwanese people and injured 20 others, shows that they have not shaken off their violent nature. The article in the Japanese Constitution that condemns war is worthy of praise, but its true value still depends on whether it can be faithfully implemented. China will strongly urge Japan to respect this article. Regarding the international disarmament plan, I have always regarded it as one of the most noble goals for humanity and also one of the major working goals of the United Nations. When Japan has the qualifications to join the United Nations, its right to self-defense will become a "delicate" issue, but the efforts of major country politicians to curb war will not be in vain, so it will not put Japan in a difficult position. China is a peace-loving country and hates the outbreak of a third World War.</p>
<h3>A Portion of Japanese Assets to be Distributed as Reparations Soon; Full Reparations Issue Still Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that a portion of Japanese assets will soon begin to be distributed to countries that have made requests as reparations. According to the current decision, the assets to be distributed include 1,100 military factories. The method of distribution will be executed by the United States issuing instructions to MacArthur, as the United States is the main occupying country of Japan and therefore has this power. However, the immediate dismantling and distribution of Japanese military factories will not solve the entire reparations issue. Disputes will continue to arise among the countries of the Far Eastern Commission. Although the commission is keeping silent about the distribution work, United Press reporters dare to say that all parties related to the reparations issue can indicate that the commission and other related parties have largely agreed on determining Japan's post-war equipment needs based on the 1931 Japanese industrial standard. Japan's wartime industrial development, focusing on steel and related parts, will not affect the entire reparations plan determined based on this standard. 1931 was the year Japan initiated the Mukden Incident, starting its aggression and adventurism. The United Nations will draft a reparations plan based on the situation before the incident. Recently, the United States proposed that countries of the Far Eastern Commission submit suggestions for this to accelerate the process, but some countries in the commission are unwilling to participate, so progress is slow. It seems that various countries believe that once they acknowledge the United States' proposal, the entire issue will be controlled by the United States, and they believe that the basic purpose of the United States' recent proposal is to avoid the Soviet Union's attacks on the Japanese reparations issue.</p>
<p>US and Soviet Views Clearly Different</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission initially attempted to convene a meeting to resolve this issue, but it was suspended due to Soviet opposition. Later, the United States Department of State considered convening another meeting, but it gave up on this idea because the Soviet Union refused to consider the "war booty" obtained by the Red Army in the eastern nine provinces of China as reparations materials. Some countries have raised doubts about the temporary distribution of reparations materials, believing that it may not meet the current needs of the countries receiving reparations. Japanese factories have advanced technical equipment that requires technical personnel to operate. It is doubtful whether the countries that receive these factories have enough skilled personnel to use them effectively. As for the countries accepting reparations materials, although they have not been designated, China and the Philippines are of great importance.</p>
<h3>US Delegation Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 28th] A seven-member U.S. reparations delegation, dispatched by Secretary of the Army Patterson to discuss the Japanese reparations issue with MacArthur, arrived here this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Japanese officials stated that U.S. Representative to Japan Atcheson will return to the United States by plane tomorrow to conduct routine consultations with the Department of State. Former French Ambassador to China, Pechkov, will travel to the United States on the same plane. Atcheson is expected to return to Japan in three to four weeks. During his absence, his duties will be handled by Byroade.</p>
<h3>Sudden Action by a Japanese Person: Meeting MacArthur Like an Assassination Attempt</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Reliable sources informed our correspondent today that when MacArthur entered the Allied headquarters on the morning of the 26th, a Japanese carpenter, holding a long package, rushed forward, intending to throw the package at MacArthur, but MacArthur personally caught him and seized the package. Inside the package was a wooden sword and a letter requesting assistance. It briefly stated that the Japanese people have been in dire straits since the defeat in the war. He requested MacArthur to provide more assistance and hoped that MacArthur would create a democratic Japan. He would not regret being shot dead by the guards. Afterwards, MacArthur instructed an American military police officer to teach him proper etiquette and immediately released him. However, the wooden sword has been given by MacArthur to his 11-year-old son as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Representative of the Moscow Patriarchate Denied Entry into Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 28th Broadcasting: According to Moscow TASS, MacArthur's staff has refused to allow the representative of the Moscow Patriarchate to go to Japan, saying that this act is "an unfriendly act towards the Soviet Church."</p>
<h3>Japanese Orphans and Widows Returning Home from Abroad in Succession</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] Ships carrying Japanese orphans and widows from overseas are increasing in number. Their fathers and husbands were all victims of the "Greater East Asia War." Many women have had no news of their husbands since they went to the battlefield. The Women's Repatriation Association estimates that three million women and children will return from overseas, most of whom are family members of fallen soldiers.</p>
<h3>Greece Announces Foreign Policy: Willing to Maintain Friendship with Neighboring Countries; Determined to Use All Efforts to Reduce Domestic Guerrilla Forces</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 27th] The seven-party coalition government formed by the new Prime Minister Maximos announced today that the new government intends to conduct a policy of equal friendship with the Allied powers and maintain friendly relations with the Balkan and Mediterranean neighbors. Mr. Maximos declared in the House of Representatives that Greece's foreign policy is formulated based on its historical and geographical position. Greece is both a Balkan country and a Mediterranean country, so it is willing to maintain friendly relations with its Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean neighbors and establish commercial ties to seek mutual benefit. Mr. Maximos also declared that the government intends to take a resolute approach to the guerrilla forces in the country. The government has decided to amend the previous method of deporting enemy overseas Chinese back to their countries. The order regarding the deportation of women and children will be suspended, and an amnesty will be granted to traitors who surrender within the deadline.</p>
<p>This afternoon, another 16 ministers and seven secretaries swore in. The new government is still incomplete because the National Party, led by former right-wing guerrilla leader General Zervas, has not yet decided on candidates for the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The seats of the new government are distributed according to the strength of the seven parties in the House of Representatives. The new government has 16 members from the People's Party (Royalist), four from the Liberal Party, three from the National Liberal Party, four from the Social Democratic Party, and one from the Workers' Union Reform Party and the National Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the UK Meets with Bevin</h3>
<p>Likely Related to Alliance Treaty</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 28th Broadcasting: According to officials, British Foreign Secretary Bevin reviewed the issues involved in the recent exchange of letters between Bevin and Stalin during a meeting with Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Zharovin, in London yesterday, but that side did not specify the nature of yesterday's talks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The new Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Zharovin, paid his first visit to Foreign Secretary Bevin at the British Foreign Office this afternoon. Well-informed sources believe that Bevin discussed with him the possibility of extending the term of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty and deleting the "reservations" mentioned by Stalin in his recent exchange of letters with the British Foreign Secretary. At the same time, according to reliable sources, the Anglo-French alliance treaty is being drafted in the Foreign Office, but it has not yet been submitted to the Cabinet. On the one hand, it is discussing with the French authorities the best way to conduct formal negotiations.</p>
<h3>At the Far East Military Tribunal, Japanese War Criminals Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. The defense lawyer for former Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Central China, Matsui, submitted a plea on behalf of the defendant in the Nanjing Massacre case, stating that the order to attack Nanjing was issued by the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters. Matsui's headquarters was located in Suzhou and was not aware of the killings and rapes by the Japanese army. Former Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, stated that he only worked in the Japanese diplomatic circle and had no connection with the Japanese military's aggression. He opposed the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Japan, and Italy, and he was only responsible for conveying the United Nations' protests against the Japanese army's mistreatment of prisoners of war, and nothing else.</p>

<h3>Secret Stories of World War II</h3>
<p>The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the only two the United States had at the time.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Former Secretary of War Stimson stated in an article published in this month's "Harper's Magazine" that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 were the only two the United States possessed at the time. Military authorities firmly believed that unless atomic bombs were used, the war could not end until the second half of 1946 at the earliest, which would mean the United States military would suffer at least one million more casualties.</p>
<p>America Keeps Secrets, Japan Unaware of the Facts</p>
<p>The United States kept the atomic bomb a closely guarded secret, and the Japanese were unable to ascertain the true situation. They believed that our ability to carry out atomic attacks was unlimited and that we could attack with large formations of aircraft simultaneously whenever necessary. Consequently, they decided to surrender. In reality, we had exhausted our entire supply. Comparing the lesser of two evils, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the great war and fully demonstrated that we must never have war again.</p>
<p>Stimson also stated that from 1941 to 1945, he never heard President Roosevelt or other government officials express any intention that atomic energy should not be used in the war. On April 25, 1945, he told President Truman that the United States was capable of manufacturing and utilizing atomic bombs, something other countries would not be able to achieve for many years.</p>
<p>Japan Still Had Five Million Troops at the Time</p>
<p>In the summer of 1945, Japan's total military strength was five million soldiers and five thousand kamikaze aircraft. By July of that year, the Japanese navy was almost completely destroyed, except for what was needed to contain the American fleet attacking its homeland. The United States included atomic bombs in its plan to invade the Japanese mainland. If we had followed this plan and invaded Japan on the planned date of November 1, 1945, the loss of Japanese life and property from B-29 Superfortress bombings alone, plus five major bombing raids, would have exceeded the casualties from the two atomic bomb attacks. However, the psychological impact of the atomic bombs was even greater.</p>
<p>Stimson also said that the manufacturing process of atomic bombs was complex, and only a few people knew the details. In a memorandum to Truman on April 25, 1945, Stimson announced that other countries would not reach the United States' level for several years. He also said that it may not be possible for smaller countries to manufacture atomic bombs in the future, or for larger countries to manufacture them in a very short period.</p>
<p>Truman Decided to Use Atomic Bombs</p>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 27th] President Truman personally decided during the war to use atomic bombs to attack Japan. This was revealed in a letter from the President to the President of MIT, Compton, in the February issue of "The Atlantic Monthly." Compton had written an article in the magazine saying that atomic bombs had saved the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Americans and Japanese and shortened the war by several months. The President's letter stated: "The article in the 'Atlantic Monthly' is a fair analysis of the actual situation. However, the final decision had to be made by the President and was thoroughly reviewed in advance. The Japanese received wireless warnings and were informed of the surrender terms before the atomic bombs were dropped. These terms were eventually accepted, and I believe this was the achievement of the atomic bombs." Two months before the atomic bombs were dropped, Compton had been working at MacArthur's headquarters in Manila. Reportedly, conversations with Japanese scientists after the war proved that most Japanese believed they were winning the war until the surrender was announced, when they woke up as if from a dream.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Collective Security System Depends on Controlling Atomic Energy: Austin Announces No Change in US Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Austin, told reporters after meeting with Secretary of State Marshall today that the United States' policy on international control of atomic energy will not change. It is understood that Austin and Marshall met for one hour and forty minutes. Regarding the postponement of the discussion on disarmament and the control of atomic energy to February 4 by the Security Council, it is said that Austin has decided not to request another postponement at that time. The United States has always advocated disarmament and is now even more active in doing so.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 27th] UN Security Council Representative Austin recently gave a speech to the New York State Bar Association, saying that establishing an international control system for atomic energy and other armaments, including provisions for punishing violators, is an important task in establishing a collective security system. He said that establishing a collective security system is an urgent task. If this system can be established and effective international controls (including international inspections) and provisions for punishing violators can be in place, we can obtain some assurance that all countries in the world can safely reduce their armies. Without this system, no country in the world can achieve security or reduce its army. The cost of establishing this system for all countries in the world is to further delegate sovereignty, and this matter is related to civilization. Humanity's choice is no longer who will win the next great war. The choice now is to prevent a third world war and avoid the harm of atomic bombs and other, even more destructive, potential weapons. We cannot hide, ignore, or exaggerate the obstacles in our future. We cannot misinterpret the basic concepts and necessary conditions of our time. The foundation of the United Nations is laid on reality, and the potential power of its charter and its affiliated organizations is far beyond general speculation. Austin reiterated his position that the United States opposes any changes to the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council. He further pointed out that Article 1 and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter contain provisions to prevent permanent members from easily using their veto power to prevent the Security Council from expanding its work.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Lacks Sincerity</h3>
<p>Secretly Engaged in Scientific Research - US Senator Shea Criticizes</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Senator McMahon, chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and the person who drafted the domestic atomic control plan, spoke in the Senate today, urging the establishment of an international control agreement. He said that atomic knowledge must be controlled immediately. It is not dangerous for us to possess this bomb, but it will be fatal if others have it as well. Today, we cannot know how advanced other countries are in the manufacture of atomic weapons, but we know that other countries are researching day and night. If we continue to lack accurate knowledge, we will be troubled by terror and suspicion. For example, not long ago we received a report from the Soviet Union stating that the country's nuclear physicist, Kapitza, had been exiled to Siberia for committing some kind of crime. From my point of view, it is better to interpret this as Kapitza now being behind the Ural Mountains, busy building an atomic fission laboratory. If the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to ban atomic bombs and other large-scale destructive weapons, it should accept the United States' control plan. The position of Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Joint Committee has now been succeeded by Republican Senator Hickenlooper. The committee will conduct research with President Truman's Federal Atomic Energy Commission next Monday.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Can Be Used for Industry Successfully in Two or Three Years</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Gordon, director of the Science and Technology Division of the Department of Commerce, announced today that atomic energy should be used as a source of industrial energy in two or three years. There is no doubt that thorium and uranium (atomic materials) can be used as fuel to emit heat, steam, and electricity.</p>
<h3>Powerful Radio Station Built Northwest of Manila, Broadcasting American Programs to China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 28th] State Department telecommunications experts have built a powerful radio station 25 miles northwest of Manila to broadcast American programs to China and the Soviet Union. It is now complete and ready for testing. This radio station has been under construction for years, but officials have not announced its purpose. However, according to reliable sources, this is a state-of-the-art, most powerful device that can broadcast three programs simultaneously to any location in the world. According to the tentative plan, the Philippine government will use it for domestic broadcasting during the day, and at night it can broadcast programs to China, Siberia, and Southeast Asian countries, including India. It is said that American radio programs can only be clearly received through this rebroadcast.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] US Chief of Staff General Eisenhower said in a speech to a women's club of an American newspaper today that the people of the Soviet Union are very willing to establish friendship with the United States. He said that Russians have a deep love for their country and added, "A Russian told me that Soviet leaders know very well that the Soviet people will fight for Russia even if they do not fight for the Communist Party." Eisenhower asserted that no major power is truly provoking war, because no country is ready and no country can endure war, but this does not mean that war will not happen.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Troops Retreat Northwest of Hanoi</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] The French High Command announced today that Viet Minh forces are retreating from the northwest of Hanoi in disarray, and the entire area between the Red River and the Great Lakes is now completely under French control.

<p>[This newspaper] London, 28th broadcast: The British and American consuls stationed in Hanoi admitted that they attended official banquets of the Viet Minh government, but firmly denied that they had encouraged the Wang Zhang (propaganda) promoted by the Viet Minh radio station. The British and American consuls said that they and the Chinese consul went to the Viet Minh area on January 22 at the invitation of the Viet Minh government to inspect the local situation and discuss the issue of civilian evacuation.</p>
<h3>Indian Foreign Ministry Announces: No Foreign Envoys Will Be Selected for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] The Indian Foreign Ministry announced today that domestic and foreign reports that India will select foreign envoys are purely speculation and have no basis. Much of the speculation has focused on the possible appointment of Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, as ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Bevin Announces: British-Egyptian Negotiations Officially Break Down</h3>
<p>Egyptian House of Representatives Passes Vote of Confidence</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that negotiations between Britain and Egypt to revise the 1936 alliance treaty have broken down due to Egypt's insistence on annexing Sudan. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy also announced to the country's parliament that Egypt is demanding the withdrawal of British troops and hopes that the British side can be more lenient during future negotiations. The British-Egyptian alliance treaty will expire and become invalid in 1956, and Egypt will naturally abide by it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy announced in the House of Representatives tonight that his cabinet had decided to submit the British-Egyptian treaty issue to the United Nations. The members then passed a vote of confidence in the cabinet by a vote of 175 to 15, with six abstentions. The members of the opposition party all voted in favor of the vote of confidence.</p>

<h3>Polish Note to Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Submits Requests Regarding Germany; Two Proposals on Austrian Peace Treaty Passed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Polish Ambassador to Britain submitted another memorandum to the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference this afternoon, making several requests regarding Germany and advocating the liquidation of Prussia so that it would no longer pose a threat to European peace. The specific measures include the following: (1) Even after the implementation of the peace treaty with Germany, Germany should still be controlled by the Allied countries until Germany's peaceful and democratic revival. (2) German industry can only be developed for peaceful purposes, and the Allied countries must guarantee that assisting the war-torn countries should take precedence over assisting Germany. (3) Regarding the border between Germany and Poland, Poland has the right to submit detailed plans in the future. (4) Poland can also demand equipment from Germany as compensation. (5) Poland requests that the peace treaty with Germany be signed in Warsaw, because Poland suffered the most from German aggression. (6) Germany should quickly disarm. The work of eliminating the Nazis has also been unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference unanimously adopted the proposal made by General Clark, commander of the US occupation forces in Austria, to establish a military subcommittee to quickly consider the military clauses of the draft peace treaty with Austria in the British and American proposals. The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference also adopted the Soviet representative's proposal that the Allied Control Commission in Vienna should submit an accurate report on the disarmament and restriction of Austria's military potential.</p>

<h3>Group Portrait of Republican Leaders Who Control the Fate of the United States</h3>
<p>— Translated and Described by the Newspaper's Information Office</p>
<p>Although there is only one president in the White House, Washington has many behind-the-scenes rulers who wield collective power, and that is the Republican leaders in Congress. In this Congress, the Republican Party has returned to Washington with the power of parliament after an absence of sixteen years. Now they are the actual decision-makers of American domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<p>The most familiar Republican leaders in Congress to the American people are Taft, Vandenberg, Ball, and Martin. They are all congressional figures who can directly influence national policy. At the same time, they have the power to decide on next year's tax revenue, armaments, construction, and labor policies. They hope to reduce government administrative expenses, limit the power of the federal government, abolish Washington's commercial intervention policies, and greatly change the current labor laws.</p>
<p>Here, let us give a brief introduction to these Republican leaders:</p>
<p>Taft is the leader of the Republican senators in the Senate, and he has the power to influence domestic legislation. Taft's attitude is gentle, kind, and approachable, like a teacher. In the last Congress, he made great contributions to the revision of various major regulations. He also strongly criticized President Truman's price control bill. Last summer, when President Truman used military force to suppress the railway workers' strike, Taft also stood in opposition. He is the leader of the conservative faction in the Republican Party and presides over the Senate Education and Labor Committee. Taft is now the Republican Party's spokesperson on domestic issues.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, the most important figure in the Republican Party is naturally Vandenberg.</p>
<p>Vandenberg is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has a great influence on the determination of foreign policy. This person is open-minded and can be said to be the most "one world" thinker in the Republican Party other than Willkie. Vandenberg was a journalist. Because he is good at speaking, he has made a lot of headlines in the Senate. Now, in Congress, he is more passionate about opposing isolationism than any other Republican. However, tracing his past, he was indeed a complete isolationist. Even in 1940, when the German army occupied France, he and most Republicans still opposed the arms program. It was not until the Pearl Harbor incident broke out that he broadened his vision and adopted an internationalist policy.</p>
<p>Next, we talk about Martin. Martin has considerable power in the House of Representatives and may become the Speaker of the House in the future. He is also very kind, has organizational skills, does not smoke or drink, and advocates strengthening party discipline and stopping rebellions. Examining Martin's past, he is also an isolationist like Vandenberg. Therefore, in 1940, he was strongly criticized by President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Martin started as a newsboy at the age of five, was a reporter for a newspaper at the age of eighteen, and was the publisher of the Chronicle Evening News at the age of twenty-four. He never received higher education. His concept is:</p>
<p>"The responsibility of the Republican Party is to save the country to maintain the American way of life."</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about Ball. Ball is tall and rough. He worked as a journalist and entered politics in 1940 because of Stassen's introduction. He attracted the attention of people all over the United States with his advocacy of promoting international cooperation. Later, he also engaged in a movement to weaken the power of labor groups. Ball is forty-two years old. His wife, Betty, helps him handle political affairs. They do not use a maid at home. Mr. Ball helps his wife wash the dishes when he comes back from Congress.</p>
<p>In short, from now on, most of the fate of the United States is indeed in the hands of these powerful congressmen, but the traditional American system of "checks and balances" still exists effectively.</p>
<p>The three key members of the US Republican Party, from right to left, are Vandenberg, Martin, and Taft. (Special photo sent by the New York Times of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>British High Commissioner for Palestine Orders Jews to Hand Over Kidnapped Englishmen</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 27th] The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Cunningham, informed Jewish leaders tonight that if the two Englishmen currently detained by the Jewish terrorist group are not safely returned within the specified time, civil administration and various conveniences will be withdrawn in certain areas and placed under military control. The two Englishmen are a former major in the army and a judge in the local court. It is said that they have been ordered to return within forty-eight hours. This "ultimatum" was addressed to Mrs. Myers, a member of the Executive Board of the Jewish Public Association, and Logashu, the mayor of Tel Aviv. Jewish terrorist groups in the Tel Aviv area are becoming increasingly rampant, and the overall situation is quite serious. From dusk to dawn, the entire Jewish city is under strict curfew. It is said that British civilians who are not Jewish are now leaving the city to avoid being kidnapped.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 28th] Large numbers of soldiers from the British 6th Airborne Division flew to Tel Aviv this morning and began searching for Wyndham, the Chief Justice of the District Court who was kidnapped yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Arab Representatives Oppose Partition</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] The vice chairman of the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine, Husseini, addressed the session of the Palestine Conference here today, severely criticizing the Jews' attempt to establish a state in the Holy Land and declaring that the Arabs will do everything possible to oppose the so-called Arab-Jewish partition plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Dr. Gurion, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish National Movement, held talks with Jones, Minister of the British Colonial Affairs Department, today.</p>

<h3>The Four Lines Barracks' Lone Army and Returning Soldiers - Fighting the Enemy and Establishing Merit - All Sectors Express Respect and Admiration - Enthusiastic Participation in慰劳 - Two Wives Narrate Hardships of Life, Breaking Down in Tears</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A Shanghai municipal各界慰劳 conference for the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and soldiers returning from Australia was held yesterday at the Military Friends Society on Zhapu Road. More than 500 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Chairman Fang, and representatives from various agencies. According to the arranged慰劳 program, at 9:00 AM, people were sent to the residences of the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers to welcome them. At 10:00 AM, the movie "Ode to the Police" was screened at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall to entertain the attendees. At noon, lunch was provided to all attendees in the Military Friends Society auditorium, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. During the meal, Chairman Fang delivered a speech, stating that Hongkou District was the origin of the "August 13th" War of Resistance. The comrades of the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers from 淡 were all meritorious in the War of Resistance, and gathering here had even deeper significance. Fang specifically pointed out that the 19th Route Army were national heroes of the War of Resistance, and others participating in the War of Resistance were also national heroes. Mayor Wu continued with a speech stating that those who fought in the War of Resistance to save the nation were national heroes. Those who quelled internal strife, helped the government stabilize social order, and worked hard to increase production were all nameless heroes of the Chinese nation. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, expressing his deep慰劳 to the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers. Finally, he said that the construction of world peace depends entirely on one's own strength. Soldiers can be prepared but not used, but they cannot be absent for even a day. Therefore, he deeply hoped that all sectors of Shanghai would assist the government in promoting the conscription system, and he hoped that the citizens of Shanghai would enthusiastically participate in military service.

<h3>Attention Should Be Paid to Circumstances Favorable to the Defendant - Not Just to Excel at Exposing and Uncovering Villains - Ministry of Justice Instructs High Courts of Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has recently issued instructions to the presidents and chief prosecutors of high courts in various provinces and cities regarding matters that should be noted when handling cases. The main points are as follows: (1) Not only should they excel at exposing and uncovering villains, but they should also pay attention to all circumstances favorable to the defendant. (2) They should carefully investigate whether the accusations and reports are maliciously framed or abused before proceeding. Unless necessary, the defendant should not be summoned. (3) Defendants without a fixed residence, who are at risk of fleeing, who may conceal or collude with witnesses, who have committed crimes punishable by death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of five years or more as the lightest principal sentence, and who are suspected of committing a serious crime, may be detained or arrested without summons or detention. Those who meet the statutory requirements for detention but do not necessarily need to be detained may still be released on bail or restricted from residing elsewhere. (4) Defendants who are detained and currently suffering from a disease that is unlikely to be cured without medical treatment outside prison, who are seven months pregnant or more, or who have given birth less than one month ago, and whose crimes are punishable by imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or a fine, shall not be rejected if they apply for suspension of detention with bail. (5) When interrogating defendants, not only should they avoid violence, coercion, enticement, fraud, and other improper methods, but they should also treat them with a sincere attitude and give them the opportunity to clarify the suspicion of crime and make continuous statements about the beginning and end of the matter. (6) If the evidence of the crime is clear and there are circumstances under Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law or Article 74 of the Criminal Law, they may still not be prosecuted or granted probation. All of these provisions are intended to reduce the harm of being implicated. As for major social 巨 and national 蟊賊, it is not appropriate to show slight leniency.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Banquet Donations and Entertainment Tax - To be Implemented from Next Month</h3>

<p>[Our Report] This reporter made a special visit yesterday to the person in charge of the Social Bureau to inquire whether the ticket prices will also be generally lowered after the reduction of the entertainment donation tax.

Recently, movie ticket prices have risen by 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and the highest ticket price for Peking opera has risen from 20,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan, which seems excessive. After the tax reduction, it is hoped that the movie and theater operators can voluntarily lower the ticket prices.

<p>During the dinner, Pan gave a speech saying: "Today is the 'January 28th' in the Gregorian calendar. Looking back fifteen years, it was when our army bravely fought the enemy in the Battle of Shanghai. This glorious date is worth our deep commemoration. At the same time, today is also the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, which coincides with 'Human Day.' Under these two meanings, it inspires us to strive hard, be good people, and the reason why this gathering is held in Hongkou is to urge us to be vigilant. Its significance is even greater as the country moves forward in construction.</p>
<p>Today, I am hosting comrades from Shanghai's news, literary, writer, and drama departments. Due to space limitations, I regret that I cannot meet everyone. In the future, I plan to continue to meet with each department separately so that we can have more opportunities to connect and exchange opinions. Recalling the past during the War of Resistance, all comrades in the cultural circles have adhered to their posts and served the country. During this time, they endured hardships, and their unyielding spirit is worthy of our heartfelt admiration."</p>

<h3>Style of Hanging National Flags - Ordered to Pay Attention to Improvement - Yuanfang Vegetable Vendor's Stall Case - A Suitable Location Has Been Determined Separately - Municipal Government Responds to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Government has begun to implement and respond to the resolutions of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council one after another. Regarding the Council's suggestion: (1) Please order the Police Bureau to rectify the way national flags are hung to ensure uniformity. The Municipal Government replied that it has ordered the Police Bureau and its branches to pay attention to improvement and has produced three types of slides, totaling 120, which are distributed to cinemas for three weeks to show, so that citizens can understand the regulations for hanging national flags. (2) It is requested that the Yuanfang Road Vegetable Market stalls continue and that the small triangular site be leased to set up stalls. The Municipal Government stated that the land rights at that location belong to Yunshide School, which has agreed to the school's request to clear the vegetable vendors. The Health Bureau and the Police Bureau have now verified that there is a Tongzhou Road vegetable market nearby that can be used to set up stalls, and it has been determined that an open-air stall can also be set up in the Dongyuyao Road vegetable market. Therefore, the Yunshide School site does not need to be leased. (3) The Council requested that the Women's Education and Rehabilitation Center be established quickly.

<h3>Acquainted with a Dancer - Two Hearts Entwined - Tobacco Merchant's Love Affair Dispute - Each Has His Own Story About Chasing the Diamond Ring</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Pang Liansheng, General Manager of Lianji Tobacco Company and Chinese Manager of Sino-American Lianhe Rainy Tobacco Leaf Company, is over fifty years old and resides at No. 6, Block B, Lane 1451, Xinzha Road. Before the Lunar New Year, he became acquainted with Meng Yunwei, a red dancer from Guangdong at the Dadong Dance Hall (pictured, 25 years old), and the two hearts were entwined. Pang opened a long room at No. 505 of the Dadong Inn. Meng said that she had no residence, so Pang opened Room 408 of Dadong on New Year's Eve for her to sleep in. The two were near the water and the tower, and often visited each other. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Pang presented Meng with a diamond ring weighing 1.95 carats, valued at 4.5 million yuan. According to Pang, he told Meng: I am specially offering this as an engagement ring for both parties, hoping to enhance our relationship and grow old together. Meng nodded and accepted the ring and left. Unexpectedly, Pang suddenly regretted it after Meng left, and that night he went to the Lao Guan Branch to accuse Meng of stealing his diamond ring. The branch immediately sent officers to the Dadong Dance Hall to investigate the truth. At that time, Meng Yunwei happened to be at the Yangzi Dance Hall for tea dancing, which was contrary to the police officers. It was not until about 8:00 PM that Meng arrived at Dadong. After being asked about the diamond ring by many handkerchief friends, she was also told that the police had come to investigate the case. Meng suddenly realized and was unhappy. It was not until about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon that Meng went to the Lao Zha Branch and told the whole story, admitting to the ring as a gift. Later, the bureau sent police to summon Pang to the bureau for individual interrogation. According to Pang, the ring was sold to his wife at home, and she paid for it after seeing it. He brought it to the room of the Dadong Inn, but unexpectedly it was stolen by him. According to Meng Yunwei: It was indeed given by him the day before yesterday, intending to get engaged. After I accepted it, he made a further request, wanting to do something indecent. After strict refusal, he broke up unhappily. Not long after, I went out in anger. Who knew that he became angry and reversed the facts, coming to the bureau to falsely accuse me of stealing the diamond ring. After interrogation, both parties insisted on their own stories, and they were ordered to go out temporarily for further investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>A Tragedy on the Lower Level of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's Elevator - Worker Repairing the Switch - Elevator Driven Down and Crushed</h3>
<p>Shen Xingen, a Ningbo native, who lives upstairs at the Guofeng Cigarette and Paper Store on Xiaoshadu Road, is 40 years old this year.

<h3>Tianjin Baihe Freezes - Ships Temporarily Unable to Navigate</h3>

<h3>Guo Taiqi's Property Lawsuit: Tenants Refuse to Move, Appeal Filed with the High Court</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the victory, the housing shortage in our city has been severe, and the practice of demanding gold bars as "key money" is rampant, leading to frequent disputes between landlords and tenants. Recently, a property in Shanghai belonging to Guo Taiqi, an important figure in the party and the country, has also been involved in a lawsuit due to a lease relationship. It is said that Mr. Guo owns four houses on Tai'an Road and two houses on Wukang Road in this city. These properties were formerly managed by the real estate department of Wu Shang Gong and Yangxing. After the victory, the management was transferred to the Shanghai Bank Trust Department. Several months ago, the tenants were notified in writing, on the grounds that the landlord needed to reclaim the property for personal use, that their leases would not be renewed and they had to move out by a deadline. The tenants, due to the severe housing shortage, were unable to move and did not do so. The landlord then filed a lawsuit in court, which ruled that the tenants must move out and granted immediate enforcement. However, the tenants, citing that they have lived in the premises for many years, that the government has repeatedly stipulated protections for tenants, and that Mr. Guo's family members already live in one of the houses, were dissatisfied with the judgment and have appealed to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Visits Child Refugees, Encourages Them to Study Skills Diligently: Over 1,600 Street Children Find New Life in Shelter</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] When you enter the Caohejing Shelter, you will see a vast drill ground, orderly buildings, and hundreds of children, from seven or eight years old to eighteen or nineteen years old, all dressed very neatly. They wear light gray cotton scout uniforms, black sneakers, white socks, and white gloves. Their faces are rosy, and they are energetic and orderly during drills. You will also hear the small military band practicing enthusiastically and the choir singing loudly. The reading room is crowded with children grabbing books, and they listen attentively to the lecturers in class. During free time, they put on roller skates and skate around, making you feel full of life and vitality. However, can you believe that most of them were once beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, "little thirds" (referring to those involved in petty theft as part of a group), "water rats" (referring to those who steal from ships), or juvenile delinquents? When this reporter visited the shelter yesterday, 60 "street children" had just been sent in from the Bi Han Shelter. Some had run away from home after being abused by their stepmothers, and one young monk had run away from the temple because he could not endure the abbot's abuse and had resorted to stealing to survive. Some had scabies, and others had unkempt hair. Most of them had dirt on their faces, hands, and clothes. Compared to the children on the drill ground, they were very different. In fact, it is said that the well-trained children were even worse off than the newcomers seen yesterday when they first arrived, because the new arrivals had already been fed and clothed at the Bi Han Shelter for three months.</p>
<p>The child refugees come from different places. Some are street children sent in by the police, some are unruly children whose parents cannot control them, some are lost, and some are abandoned. In the past year, under the diligent leadership of Director Zhou Zuwang, the shelter has taken in over 4,000 child refugees. There are currently 1,600, including a few adults and over a hundred girls. When new children arrive at the shelter, the first thing is registration, followed by shaving their heads, bathing, disinfection, changing clothes, physical examination, and finally, they are sent to the psychological rehabilitation room for numbering.</p>
<p>The shelter is well-organized and disciplined. The children take care of all their activities themselves. Apart from a few staff members, washing clothes, cooking, and management are all handled by several "grand uncles" (older children) or refugees. What is most interesting and admirable is that they have their own "small court." This small court is completely democratic, and the three or four "judges" are all "elected by Wu." When reporters visited yesterday, the small court was hearing a case and was quite careful and thorough. It is said that when larger cases arise, the judges must consult with other jurors before announcing the verdict. The most serious crimes are stealing items from companions (such as pencils, erasers, etc.), cheating companions out of candy, and attempting to escape. The punishments are confinement in a "black room" for up to two weeks, or solitary confinement, etc.</p>
<p>The children are divided into various teams, with many team leaders of various sizes, even scabies team leaders, who are in charge of children with scabies. Those with serious illnesses are isolated for treatment.</p>
<p>Learning Skills to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Yesterday, the children were particularly excited because a distinguished guest arrived: Education Director Chiang Ching-kuo. Accompanied by Wu Shaoshu, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League, and Cao Jun, the secretary-general, Director Chiang visited the shelter at 11:30 AM. He first inspected the teams, visited various activities, and delivered a speech, stating briefly: "I hope you will not be discouraged because you are poor. You should study useful skills well and serve the country in the future."</p>
<p>Indeed, who can say that among these many children, there will not be a standout figure in the future! Even in the present, these children are not without contributions to society. In addition to transforming themselves into new children, they also help the citizens of Shanghai by cleaning up piles of garbage every day and organizing teams to dredge the sewers.</p>
<p>However, moral guidance alone is not enough; they must also be provided with material support. The shelter authorities, especially Director Zhou, have great hopes for these children and have long established various plans. However, without the help of people in society, the work is difficult to carry out. The shelter's monthly expenses are about 30 million yuan or more, and the flour for food is supplied by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The municipal government, limited by its finances, provides very limited subsidies each month. Other income all relies on successive donations from enthusiastic philanthropists. After visiting the shelter last year, Mayor Wu's wife was very moved and often sent meat for the children to eat, because normally they only eat some vegetable noodle soup for each meal. They sleep on cement floors at night, but they all have straw mats and each person has a cotton blanket. The cleanliness and discipline are no less than that of the military. No wonder Director Chiang said that their training is so orderly and even better than that of the Air Force Preparatory School.</p>
<p>Great Philanthropist Donates Huge Sum</p>
<p>Director Zhou hopes to renovate the shelter this year and lay flooring so that the children will not be too cold when they sleep. In addition, he plans to conduct national education. Fortunately, the school building is not a problem, and a certain great philanthropist has pledged to donate 200 million yuan to build it. In addition, he plans to conduct national education and, for vocational training, plans to establish (1) a young automotive driving and repair class, (2) a papermaking and printing class, (3) a music, drama, dance, and recitation class, (4) an applied art class, (5) a young textile class, (6) an agricultural class, (7) a sewing and leather making class, (8) a radio management class, (9) a construction class, (10) a waiter class, (11) a nursing class, (12) a typist class, (13) a telephone operator class, and (14) a barber class. However, according to Director Zhou, major factories and businesses in this city have helped to solve the problems of other classes, but the automotive driving and repair class cannot be opened, and it is also a job that the children like the most, so he is racking his brains for this matter!</p>
<p>A Commemorative Banner Received with Shame</p>
<p>When the reporters visited the shelter yesterday, they also received a warm welcome from the child refugees and were specially presented with a banner inscribed with "Turning Decayed into Living." We dare not use this as propaganda for the shelter, but we want to take the position of compatriots and the position of humanity to call on people in society to extend your hands to save these lovely children, give them the courage to behave well and be good people, and give them the opportunity to learn a skill!</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Fire Investigation Committee: Victims Speak Freely, Bitterly Accuse Firefighters of Illegal Activities, Hoping for Thorough Investigation; Steps Decided to Investigate Clearly Within Three Days</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shaanxi North Road (i.e., Seymour Road) Fire Investigation Committee held its first meeting at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those in attendance included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Municipal Government Advisor Ge Kexin, Municipal Council Representative Zhang Nai Zuo, Police Department Inspector Zhang Da, Jiangning District Head Hou Junren, Bao Chief Cai Guoliang, Jia Chief Zhang Zhiwen, Section Chief Zhang Li San, Representative from the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy Office, Investigation Specialist Zhang Quan, and victim Zheng Bijian (formerly residing at No. 27, Lane 660, Seymour Road). The meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu. The Mayor stated in his speech: A major fire occurred on Seymour Road and Wuding Road on the night of the 22nd of this month (Lunar New Year's Day). The Municipal Government and the Police Department deeply regret this unfortunate incident. Regarding rumors from the outside world that firefighters were derelict in their duties, the speaker, along with Police Department Director Xuan and Fire Department Director Zhou, both believe that the matter concerns the public interest of all citizens, and the investigation and handling must be absolutely open. The Municipal Government and the Police Department will not whitewash anything and should thoroughly investigate. The fire brigade should have a spirit of volunteerism. The speaker has now ordered the Fire Department that they must strive to put out fires in the future. Those who have made meritorious achievements may request special awards, but any malpractices must be strictly prohibited. The purpose of organizing this investigation committee is to clarify the truth and hope to prevent the recurrence of malpractices in the future. Therefore, all those present should be brave in testifying.</p>
<p>Regarding the tasks of the Investigation Committee, Mayor Wu believes that there are the following three items: (1) Administrative investigation, such as when the fire started, when the alarm was reported, when the fire brigade arrived, what was the situation during the firefighting, whether there was no oil or water, and whether there was any damage to the machinery. (2) Extortion, for this point, representatives from the Municipal Council, Jiangning District Baojia Chiefs, and affected residents are invited to fully investigate and report. (3) Looting, if any looting during the fire is verified, it will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Regarding how the Investigation Committee will proceed, it will be presided over by Director Ge. Mayor Wu especially suggested the following points: (1) Inquire with the affected residents. (2) Invite the newspaper reporters and American soldiers who arrived at the scene to testify. (3) Inquire with the commander and members of the fire brigade who arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu concluded: China must move towards democracy. For this major event, it must be open and solemn. It is hoped that the investigation will be clear within three days from tomorrow to serve as a basis for handling the matter.</p>
<p>Zheng Zaijian Narrates the Actual Situation of the Fire</p>
<p>Zheng Bijian, the victim, then narrated the situation at the time of the fire, stating briefly: On the evening the fire broke out, the speaker was playing chess and enjoying himself with his nephew. Suddenly, he heard someone shouting that the house next door was on fire. He went upstairs, pushed open the window, and saw that the fire was raging. He immediately told his family to move the boxes and valuables downstairs. But soon the fire seemed to subside, and he thought it was over, so he moved the boxes and trunks back upstairs. His family all rejoiced. Unexpectedly, the fire suddenly spread to the adjacent residence of Wang Yunfu, causing them to flee again in a hurry. At that time, the fire was raging and could no longer be brought under control.</p>
<p>The speaker was always at the scene when the fire was spreading and only saw three firefighters attempting to rescue. And their attitude was very leisurely. When asked why they did not save No. 29, which had already been affected by the fire, one firefighter replied angrily, "There is no water in the hose, what do you know?" When the fire had spread to all three floors of No. 29, the firefighters simply stood by and watched, saying, "Damn it, let it go!"</p>
<p>Taking Sundries at Will, the Police Smile Bitterly</p>
<p>Zheng also said that at the time he also witnessed a firefighter enter No. 29 at will and steal two thermos bottles, and then calmly left for Gordon Road. Zheng immediately grabbed the policeman at that intersection and asked: "The firefighter is robbing things, why don't you arrest him?" The policeman only shook his head and smiled bitterly, doing nothing.</p>
<p>Two Questions</p>
<p>Zheng then raised two questions: (1) The firefighters were all completely inexperienced. After the fire hydrant on Seymour Road was opened, it was first connected to a water pressure machine, resulting in a violent water flow and the belt could not be connected, which wasted time. (2) The fire truck has a ladder equipment, but why was it never used? If a water hose had been used to vigorously pour water from the upper and lower floors of No. 29 when the fire first started at the coppersmith's shop, then it could have been insured and nothing would have happened. Zheng concluded that the matter concerns the interests of the public, and the authorities must thoroughly investigate it!</p>
<p>Mayor Encourages Reporting As Much As Possible</p>
<p>When Zheng described his experience in detail, Mayor Wu nodded repeatedly in agreement and encouraged those present to report as much as possible. Therefore, the attendees at the meeting were agitated, and Jiangning District Head Hou Junren also said angrily: If Wang Yunfu had no property, this disaster would not have happened! Although I dare not say definitively that the firefighters were extorting money, the fact that the safe was opened and the jewelry box disappeared is indeed true!</p>
<p>Preventing American Soldiers from Rescuing</p>
<p>Jia Chief Zhang Zhiwen also reported that when the fire was raging, the American barracks to the south released a hose in an attempt to rescue, but it was stopped by the firefighters at the scene. Later, the American soldiers had to run the hose across two houses in the compound and then spray water. Zhang also listed examples of firefighters making frivolous and teasing remarks when women from the affected area carried sundries to escape.</p>
<p>Bao Chief Cai Guoliang said that he knew for sure that Wang Yunfu's house had a fluorescent lamp and a flashlight, which a firefighter borrowed to use for firefighting, but it was never returned. According to Miss Wang, there was a wardrobe in her room that was not affected, but afterwards she found that it was full of axe marks, and a jewelry box inside had disappeared. The box contained many valuable items such as diamond bracelets, and its value cannot be estimated for the time being.</p>
<p>Hoping for More Assistance from Citizens</p>
<p>After listening to the reports from all parties, Municipal Council Representative Zhang Nai Zuo expressed his opinion, saying: There have always been rumors about the city's firefighters that "you have to talk about gold bars before fighting the fire." This rumor has not been dispelled to this day. After this incident occurred, Mayor Wu personally presided over the investigation. It is firmly believed that the truth will come out. If the discipline of firefighters can be rectified in the future, malpractices can be eliminated. However, citizens must provide practical assistance. Chinese people are often accustomed to thinking that "it is better to do nothing than do something," entrusting everything to fate, so that even the victims are unwilling to come forward and testify. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that citizens will be able to provide more assistance this time.</p>
<p>Steps Decided for Investigation</p>
<p>Finally, Director Ge reported on the tasks of the Investigation Committee and decided on the following investigation steps: At 9:00 AM on the 29th, gather at Cai Bao Chief's office (No. 350, Xiaoshadu Road) and depart to the disaster area to conduct an on-site investigation and draw a map of the disaster area. At 2:00 PM on the 29th, gather at the above location again and convene all the fire victims to express their opinions. If the fire victims are unwilling to attend, the committee will visit them in person. Continue the above visits on the morning of the 30th. Visit the fire brigade in the afternoon of the 30th. Visit the American soldiers on the morning of the 31st to investigate the situation at that time. The committee also welcomed reporters from various newspapers to participate to show the Municipal Government's intention to be open in everything.</p>
<p>Supervisory Envoy Cheng Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Supervisory Envoy Cheng received Deputy Director Yu of the Police Department to hear various reports about the fire case, and at 11:00 AM, accompanied by Deputy Director Yu, went to Wuding Road to inspect the fire scene, inquired with the owners and neighbors at the fire scene, and Wang, Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department, explained the rescue situation at that time. It is heard that the Envoy Office is continuing its investigation.</p>

<h3>Three Prosecutors Inspect the Fire Scene: Wang's Wardrobe Smashed, Valuable Jewelry Disappeared; Fire Hose Pinned Under Collapsed Wall</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Three prosecutors from the District Procuratorate, Yang Shoucheng, Shen Zushou, and Huang Daping, led seven people, including a recorder and bailiffs, to the fire scene at No. 660, Seymour Road yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to inspect the scene and interview the affected residents to investigate whether the firefighters were derelict in their duties. They first went to Wang Yunfu's house, which suffered the most losses. Wang himself was out, and a female relative led the prosecutors to various places to investigate and stated that a jewelry box was indeed missing, containing items such as small gold bars and diamond rings. The jewelry box was hidden in a wardrobe on the third floor. Afterwards, it was found that the wardrobe had been smashed, and a piece of wood from the chopped off cabinet door was still left in the room. The prosecutors believed that this piece of wood had considerable value in proving the crime, so they immediately ordered the bailiffs to collect it and take it back. Next, they went to Yongqin Rubber Factory to inquire. According to one of the employees, because the factory was equipped with fire extinguishers, they were used during the fire and were quite effective, so the damage to the factory was relatively light. As for whether the firefighters demanded money, he had no way of knowing. It was also discovered that a large fire hose was pinned under a collapsed wall. The prosecutors believed that this point was also of great research value, because if the firefighters had been working hard to put out the fire, they would have been able to take care of the water hose at any time. According to eyewitnesses who reported to the prosecutors, the firefighters did not put out the fire at all and simply placed the fire hose on the ground. Later, the houses in that area caught fire, and the walls collapsed, so the fire hose was also buried. The three prosecutors returned at about 11:00 AM and will summon relevant personnel today as needed to prepare for voluntary reporting.</p>

<h3>Three Defendants Interrogated in Court in Case Involving Suspicious Sale of Materials</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The case involving the suspicion of corruption in the sale of materials by the Municipal Government's Receiving Materials Management Office and the Police Department's Police Welfare Committee, which was ordered to be thoroughly investigated by the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) in a secret order, was heard behind closed doors again at the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The defendants Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao, each accompanied by their defense lawyers, arrived in court on time. After presiding judge Huang Xianyu called the roll, he first questioned Pan Shufan, who stated: "As the Deputy Director of the Management Office, I am responsible for the routine work in the office. I only learned about the accusation after reading the case file. As for the number of fabrics sold, I no longer remember. According to the 'Measures for Selling Materials,' only public notices were posted and no advertisements were placed in newspapers. The supervisors at the time of the bidding were sent by the Police Department, and everything was reported to and approved by the superiors, and there is a record to check." Shen Shihua, the Director of the Material Management Office, was not present in court, but a lawyer acting on his behalf presented a statement stating that although he is the Director of the office, he really has no time to take care of everything, and all matters are handled by the Deputy Director and his subordinates. Xu Jingbo was then questioned and stated: "I am the Chairman of the Police Department's Police Welfare Committee. The purchase of cotton cloth was intended to enrich the foundation of the Welfare Committee. At that time, it was signed and submitted to the bureau for approval." Lawyer Li Aokui presented a copy of the signed submission.</p>
<p>Liao Gongshao stated: "As the Chief of General Affairs of the Police Department, the purchase of cotton cloth was for the benefit of the public, because at that time the police needed funds for issuing rice loans. The sale and purchase were all approved by Mayor Qian (Daxin)," and he said that Mayor Qian probably also approved it by the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek), and both the Police Department and the Municipal Government have records to check. Xu Jingbo also stated: "After the batch of cotton cloth was purchased, the market price suddenly fell back, which was lower than the bid price. Therefore, some people opposed it at the meeting of the Police Welfare Committee and did not recognize it, such as the current new...</p>
<h3>Shanghai Prison Releases Inmates Busily: Returning Deposits, Taking Fingerprints, Repeatedly Admonishing Against Reoffending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the fifth day of the Shanghai Prison releasing inmates eligible for the amnesty decree. The Shanghai Prison, after several days of painting, has a completely new appearance. The four characters of the horizontal plaque on the main gate, "Shanghai Prison," are painted in gold. The second gate is painted with the large character slogan "Understand Propriety and Righteousness, Know Integrity and Shame, Take Responsibility and Observe Discipline" in white characters on a blue background. A blue and white striped flagpole stands tall on the roof of the main gate. The national flag flutters in the wind, seemingly congratulating the inmates regaining their freedom. Family members of the inmates stood anxiously on both sides of the entrance, carrying bundles of clothes for changing, constantly looking inside. The prison's offices were unusually bustling. Warden Bai Qilin personally questioned the released inmates, first asking for their name, native place, and where they would go after release, and admonishing them not to reoffend in the future. Then, they took their fingerprints. After the procedures were completed, another bailiff gathered four or five inmates, holding exit permits, and led them out of the prison gate. Those who had deposits in the prison received their money back immediately upon presenting their passbooks, without the slightest error. Yesterday, a total of twenty-eight inmates were released, mostly for drug addiction and theft. The reporter also interviewed the person in charge of the Shanghai Prison to inquire about the total number of inmates released from the prison in the past five days. It was reported that on the first day, 281 inmates were released; on the second day, 612; on the third day, 25; on the fourth day, 84; and together with yesterday's 28, a total of 1,030 inmates eligible for the amnesty decree were released. Sub-bureau chief Zhuo Qingbao and former secretary Chen Shaoying both attended, which can prove it. As a result, the batch of cotton cloth was sold successively, and not only was there no profit, but there was a loss. All the incoming and outgoing funds are recorded in the public relief and can be checked. Judge Huang then summoned two witnesses, Wen Guangfeng and Dao Xianmo, the former deputy group leader and the current group leader of the former Property Management Office, to inquire about the bidding situation. They both said that they were acting on the orders of the director and deputy director at the time. The bidding price of the cotton cloth was 25% off the market price, and Rongmao Cotton Cloth Store won the bid. As for the owner of Rongmao and who introduced them, they all claimed not to know. The court stated that the case still needed to collect evidence and ordered a postponement for another hearing. Pan's defense lawyer, Wang Shanxiang, stood up and offered his opinion, stating that the defendant was acting under orders and whether the bidding procedures were legal or not should not be determined by newspaper announcements. Pan was particularly upright, so he asked the court to quickly investigate the evidence to clarify the truth as soon as possible. Finally, the court turned the three defendants over to three lawyers and ordered that they should be present whenever summoned for future court sessions and not evade them.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau: Devoted to Modernization Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau is currently devoted to a military-proposed modernization plan, the focus of which is to expand stations, strengthen the repair capabilities of the locomotive plants, order new types of vehicles and locomotives, and increase electrical signals.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Railway Bureau's restoration plan expired at the end of February, and thereafter, it will devote itself to modernization work. However, for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, it was originally planned to replace more than 300,000 sleepers, but due to the difficulty in obtaining sleepers, only 10,000 to 20,000 sleepers have been replaced so far.</p>

<h3>Former French Municipal Council Chinese Staff Savings Fund: Awaiting Resolution by the Liquidation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council petitioned the British Consulate in Shanghai to request the return of their pension and savings funds. However, since the city already had an organization called the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official Property Rights and Debt Liquidation Committee after the victory, the issue was transferred to the committee for handling, but it has not been resolved to date. Recently, former Chinese employees of the French Municipal Council also made the same request, asking for the return of their savings funds over the years.</p>
<p>Appointing Representatives to State Opinions</p>
<p>They appointed Xu Yaoting and Shen Weibin as representatives to attend a meeting of the French Concession Sub-committee of the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official Property Rights and Debt Liquidation Committee to explain the situation, stating that there were a total of 2,149 Chinese employees of the former French Municipal Council, and about 2,100 people have now registered to request the return of the savings funds. Many of them are from Henan and Shandong provinces and are now stranded in Shanghai, and their current situation is very difficult. Therefore, they hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>French Side Stated: No Salary Deduction</p>
<p>However, according to the French side, when the puppet government took over the concession, the Municipal Council originally intended to distribute the savings funds to the Chinese employees, but the puppet government was afraid that all the employees would resign after the distribution, which would lead to the collapse of the original organization. Therefore, they requested the Municipal Council not to distribute the funds, and this savings fund was a part of the budget set aside by the Municipal Council each year, assuming that 10% of the Chinese employees would retire, and this retirement fund was included in the budget as an expenditure, and was not deducted from the salaries of the employees.</p>
<p>The Liquidation Committee has now ordered the representatives of the former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council to compile a complete list of all personnel, indicating their Chinese names, addresses, the amount to be distributed, and whether they are still serving in the police bureau, and plans to determine a solution after reviewing the past relief register of the French Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Under Continued Control by the Central Bank, Shanghai Dollar Shows Stability</h3>
<p>Foreign Currencies Remain Unchanged, Chinese Stocks Mostly Decline</p>
<p>The Shanghai dollar was still under control by the Central Bank yesterday, but actual sales were brisk on dips, and there was some rebound. The morning opening broke the 3.9 million mark, and the Central Bank still sold in response to the market, pushing the price down to around 3.85 million before stabilizing. After 10:00 am, the Central Bank allocated 1,900 bars at a price of 3.87 million, after which it gradually stabilized. With the buying interest from strong players, it rose to around 3.93 million at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery briefly rose to 3.96 million before falling back under pressure from the Central Bank, with the low price returning to 3.87 million before settling. The result was similar to the previous close. Gold ornaments were quoted lower at 400,500, silver dollars were flat, and the informal interbank market remained tight, with interest rates around 1.8%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were extremely ordinary. The informal market for US dollars hovered between 6,700 and 6,900, with no change from morning to noon, and remained at that price at noon, similar to the previous close. The same was true for Hong Kong dollars, with the result slightly lower than the previous close by 20 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate retreated to around 1,310 yuan due to the rise in Shanghai telegraphic transfers and the influence of gold notes, with some transactions.

<h3>Export Promotion Committee to be Established in the Near Future: Providing Convenience to Merchants in Terms of Capital, Wholesale Purchasing and Sales Absolutely Untrue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to reliable sources, the Export Promotion Committee will be established in the near future, and official news is expected to be announced at the beginning of next month. The committee will establish an executive committee in the Bank of China Building, and it is said that Bei Zuyi will serve as the chairman and experts from relevant industries will be hired as consultants. The purpose of the committee is to encourage exports, and it plans to provide as much convenience as possible to export merchants in terms of capital and shipping, and will discuss export subsidy measures, so that China's export industry can actively develop under the government's encouragement. The traditional notion of wholesale purchasing and sales from the outside world is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Import Management Committee, in order to cooperate with the encouragement of exports, will list certain commodities related to alkali exports, such as lace and bleaching powder, which are used for the embroidery and pig bristle bleaching of China's exports, as examples of unlimited imports.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Turn Flat, Oil Market Declines Quietly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, about 3,000 piculs of grain arrived in Shanghai's South Gate and Zhabei, and Saigon rice continued to be supplied. A total of 330 packages were traded in the North and South Markets. Although the source of high-quality japonica and indica rice was scarce, shopkeepers saw their appetite waning due to high prices and difficult retail sales. The Central Trust Bureau shipped 86,000 packages of Thai rice by sea, which is being unloaded and will be distributed by the Social Affairs Bureau. As a result, people's hearts were weakened, and japonica and indica rice fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan in the black market, and the situation has turned flat and tired. The oil market has also been quiet because vegetable oil factories are distributing oil, and off-market prices have plummeted by more than 10,000 yuan, with few official transactions in the market. Soybean prices have been rising steadily, and the more expensive they are, the more solid they become, rising by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Oil factories have been buying from Shantou and inland areas, and the market is still bullish. Soybean cake has been continuously shipped to Taiwan and Shantou, rising slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran has been stable and rising. Flour and starch have continued to be supplied. Unified flour has continued to be supplied, and the market has stabilized. However, local flour has continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to high prices in the inland areas. Corn has been scarce in terms of arrivals and sales, and prices have remained unchanged. Red beans have been ordinary, mung beans have also been unchanged, and raw peanuts have been actively traded in Guangzhou, continuing to rise sharply, rising by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame has been active in Southeast Asia, with very strong actual sales, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Cowpeas have been absorbed by Southeast Asia and Shantou, rising alone by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Sells Over 10,000 Packages of Saigon Rice</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, the supply of rice in the city has decreased, and rice weevils have been causing problems, so rice prices have risen. Yesterday, the black market price of white rice reached 80,000 yuan. In order to suppress rice prices, the Social Affairs Bureau released more than 10,000 packages of Saigon rice in the North and South rice markets yesterday. The price was still 63,000 yuan, and the retail price was limited to 70,000 yuan. It is learned that the quality of the Saigon rice released by the Social Affairs Bureau is relatively poor, and most Shanghai citizens are accustomed to eating white rice, which is another reason for the rise in white rice prices.</p>
<h3>16,000 Import Licenses Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, the department has processed more than 98% of the import license applications for goods ordered before November 17th of last year. A total of about 16,000 licenses have been issued. As for goods ordered after that date, the department has received about 3,000 applications, but because the examination takes time, only a small number of licenses have been issued.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Purchases Silk: Sichuan Silk Arrives in Shanghai Steadily</h3>
<p>Since the China Trust Bureau began purchasing Grade D autumn silk and other baked spring and autumn silkworm silk on the 21st of this month, as of the previous day, the Loan Management Office has delivered 635 piculs of autumn silk and 235 piculs of other baked silkworm silk, totaling 870 piculs, which is more than half of the total amount of autumn silk. Yesterday, the Raw Silk Inspection Institute delivered 100 piculs of raw silk inspection forms that passed the inspection to the Loan Management Office, which will be delivered to the China Trust Bureau in a few days. It was previously estimated that the purchase would be completed within a month, but if the delivery proceeds smoothly as planned, it may only take two weeks to complete.</p>
<p>In addition, the spring and autumn raw silk produced in Sichuan last year has been steadily shipped to Shanghai. A total of more than 150 piculs have arrived this month, and it is said that another 300 to 400 piculs are also on the way, which will all be purchased by the China Trust Bureau. However, the purchase price will be lower than that of the raw silk produced in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces because its production cost is lower. It is said that the authorities are currently deciding on this.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Exchange Department Renamed Foreign Exchange Department</h3>
<p>According to news from the Secretariat of the Central Bank, the department recently notified all branches and offices of the Central Bank that the exchange department of the branches has been approved to be renamed the Foreign Exchange Department, and the words "exchange department" or "group" in Articles 6, 7, and 13 of the branch organization regulations have been amended to "foreign exchange department" or "group".</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn to be Purchased by the Government: Reported in Three Batches</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Control Committee has not yet received notification slips from various yarn factories regarding the purchase of cotton yarn.

The first batch is from the 2nd to the 12th of this month, the second batch is from the 13th to the 19th, and the third batch is from the 20th to the 26th.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants' Appetite Declines: Green Tea Sales are Desolate</h3>
<p>According to people in the industry, the Dafang Zhulan and Shuangdang green teas, which used to be popular in Tianjin, have been quiet since the New Year. The reason is that actual sales there are currently very sluggish, so imports have been declining. And among the local industry in this city, before the tea has been sold out, it is difficult to develop the market based on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil and Rubber: High Prices and No Market</h3>
<p>In the city markets after the Spring Festival, red boards have opened for almost everything, but the edible oil and rubber markets remained unopen yesterday. The edible oil market's limited prices are so low, it is hard to break the logjam, and the market can not be opened. Outside the market, the very rare transactions prices are shockingly high. Rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and crude oil are all as high as 150,000, and soybean oil is even as high as 200,000. People from the other provinces are bulk buying bean cake at the market. People in the rubber market are expecting high prices, but customers are mostly afraid to make deals at the outside prices, and the factories are in a hurry to ship their products. It is said that the authorities are paying close attention to the freezing stagnation in these two markets, and have expressed that they will not allow black market trading at high prices.</p>
<h3>Private Industrialists Demand Compensation from Japan: Plan to Establish Ten Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Our country's demand for compensation from Japan has a plan written up about compensation from Japan on the side of privately owned industries. According to Zhuang Zhihuan, the general director of the Industrial Association, there are two points of significance in the demand for compensation from Japan: first, what are the present needs of our country? Second, what is a possible number for compensation by Japan to our country? Under these two major premises, composing a plan will not be too big and unachievable. At present, the total sum of compensation by Japan to our country is yet unknown. The sum of compensation possibly gained by the privately owned industries may be 20 percent of the total sum. If machines of this compensation is at all possible, they will be used to establish ten factories, which are categorized as below: (1) shipbuilding factory; (2) bearing factory; (3) machine factory; (4) electric machinery factory; (5) electric appliance factory; (6) steam boiler factory; (7) steam engine factory; (8) internal combustion engine factory; (9) hydraulic machinery factory; (10) agriculture tool factory. These factories are planned to be established in Shanghai or the regions close to Shanghai. The machines required are said to be between 5,000 and 8,000. The shareholders will be the manufacturers who suffered damages during the war. The stocks will be distributed in proportion to the size of the losses suffered. This final plan is to be presented to the Economic Ministry in a week's time.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Distributes Goods as Before: Rayon Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon prices plunged on the black market because the China Trust Bureau continued to distribute goods to the silk weaving industry at the same prices as before. The 120-count, glossy Dongyang brand opened at 3.6 million yuan, but there were no transactions. It then plunged to 460,000 yuan, and closed at 420,000 yuan at noon, a decrease of 180,000 yuan from the previous day. Factory operations remained sluggish, and the market situation was the same as yesterday. Yesterday, the silk market was quiet because the red board prices were raised. Mayer bedspreads were quoted at 3.1 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Regulations of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department on the Handling of Foreign Cotton Purchases</h3>
<p>Regarding the application for import licenses and foreign exchange settlement for cotton imports, the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank recently notified all designated foreign exchange banks that the settlement of transactions for cotton imports already concluded by the state must be handled in accordance with the following regulations: (1) From now on, cotton import licenses can only be applied for by yarn factories. After approval, the license will be issued directly to the yarn factory. (2) For transactions concluded before November 17, 1946, the import licenses will be issued to the respective yarn factories after prior approval by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department. (3) All other license applications already submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department will be regarded as applications made after November 17. These will be returned to the designated banks by this department for delivery to the original applicants, who should follow the designated methods of the Import Cotton Allocation Committee. All applicants should pay attention to the following procedures: (A) Each applicant should directly apply to the Import Cotton Allocation Committee for an import license, which will issue a cotton allocation certificate. The designated subcommittee will issue the certificate to each yarn factory based on their actual needs (calculated according to the number of spindles already in operation), after deducting the existing cotton inventory and the quantity already approved for import. (B) If the raw cotton purchased by a yarn factory is classified as a transaction after November 17, the yarn factory can use the allocation certificate to apply for import. However, the quantity stated on the license shall not exceed the quantity stated on each allocation certificate. (C) Importers must pay attention to the following points: (1) Goods already sold to non-yarn factories must be resold to yarn factories. (2) Goods already shipped and en route but not yet sold as of November 24, 1946, can be sold to yarn factories. (3) All transactions classified as after November 17 must apply for and be issued import licenses based on the allocation certificate. The sale of such goods must target yarn factories lacking cotton. (4) Import licenses will not be issued for cotton not yet sold or shipped as of November 24, 1946. (5) The Central Bank reserves the right to settle and sell foreign exchange for the above-approved cotton imports, unless it believes that the applicant has no foreign exchange position and cannot obtain foreign exchange from other sources. (6) All future transactions for purchasing cotton from abroad must be handled in accordance with the regulations for transactions after November 17. Ge Zi Bi Zou was quoted at 500 yuan, Hua Zhong Zou at 3,600 yuan. Sheng Huo goods had listed prices but no transactions. New Hang Zhou goods were also high, and Luo Fang still had a way to go.</p>
<h3>Weak Clearance of Cotton Cloth, Cotton Market Remains Buoyant</h3>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, Shi Lin cloth was scarce due to limited factory output, and there was a slight clearance of goods from local merchants. Therefore, the asking price rose by 2,000 yuan per bolt. Fine cloth and Si Jun Zi Pi Ji were scarce on the market, but fortunately, purchases were not smooth, so the price was slightly firm. Other cloths were stable.</p>
<p>Among cotton textiles,絨衫 (velvet shirts) were out of season and the market declined. However, socks woven with 32-count yarn were selling strongly, and the market was very firm.</p>
<p>Also, in the cotton market, small yarn factories made some purchases. Bai Luo cotton and Da Zhong Ji fine lint cotton each sold two to three hundred bales, and the market was very buoyant.</p>
<h3>Joint Treasury Establishes Circuit Audit to Implement Production Loan Verification, Meeting Held Yesterday, Work Begins February 1st</h3>
<p>Post-loan auditing of production business loans is extremely important. The Joint Treasury has specially established a circuit audit, with two representatives each from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Trust Company, three representatives each from commercial banks and commercial money houses, and three representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, totaling nineteen people. Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, was appointed as the Chief Auditor, and Luo Meizhong was designated by the Joint Treasury as the Deputy Chief Auditor.

The first meeting was held at 10:00 AM yesterday on the second floor of the Bank of China Building to discuss work progress. Xu Boyuan, Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, attended and gave instructions, explaining the significance and key points of the audit in detail. He stated that the purpose of establishing this production loan circuit audit is to verify the results of loan utilization in order to determine the direction of future production loans, which is of utmost importance. All personnel participating in this audit are key cadres in the financial sector and will surely achieve the expected tasks. However, attention should be paid to close liaison between the circuit audit and the lending banks and money houses during the work. It is hoped that the audited cases will be carefully reviewed in advance, and the situation of each factory should be studied with an open mind. Subsequently, Chief Auditor Li Lixia reported on the circuit work procedures and passed several important cases, including the circuit work report format, matters requiring attention by circuit personnel, and work progress procedures and methods. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. It is reported that the circuit audit is scheduled to begin work on February 1st and will be divided into groups for auditing, with a duration of two months.</p>

<h3>New York Market Survey Demand and Prices for Chinese Export Goods in the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] The United Press recently surveyed the demand and prices for Chinese export goods in New York, with the following results:</p>
<p>Sheepskin—The sheepskin market is expected to stabilize later, but it is currently not doing well. Market prices have fallen, but sellers' asking prices are high compared to US price trends.</p>
<p>Rabbit Skin—The situation is generally the same as for sheepskin, but with larger import volumes.</p>
<p>Feathers (Duck Feathers for Bedding)—The market is highly competitive, and values have plummeted, partly due to too few bedding covers and partly due to competition from many synthetic products. The quality of imported goods deters buyers, and quantities are inconsistent. The situation is the same for patterned goods, which were imported from China before the war, but their demand changes with women's preferred styles.</p>
<p>Rhubarb—Prices are being manipulated by speculators. The price for consumption is US$1.40 to US$1.45 per pound, including freight. The market price will trend downward.</p>
<p>Musk—The competition from synthetic musk is increasing. However, dry goods are being offered up to US$85 per tael when transported to the US by air, but transactions must be based on inspection of the goods. Chinese offers have recently been as low as US$78 per tael, including ocean freight or delivery at Chinese airports.</p>
<p>Tung Oil—The standard product sells for US$0.38375 to US$0.395 per pound in the United States, but Chinese sellers are asking for US$0.40 per pound. American merchants are unwilling to import at this price due to high freight and insurance costs.</p>
<p>Pig Bristles—Government surplus goods were disposed of on January 6. American merchants hope to buy them at lower prices and are currently unwilling to import them from abroad.</p>
<p>Beeswax—Currently, only crude beeswax can be sold. Prices vary depending on the source, ranging from US$0.48 to US$0.54 per pound for delivery in New York to US$0.50 to US$0.53 per pound for delivery at African ports. According to a major buyer, purchases will resume when beeswax prices return to the normal level of US$0.20 to US$0.30 per pound.</p>
<p>Gallnuts and Myrobalan are being inflated by speculators. After the war, common gallnuts in New York were as high as US$0.46 per pound, but have recently fallen back to an average of US$0.20 per pound. Freight costs are US$40 per ton, and insurance is US$1.03 per US$100, plus other expenses. Chinese merchants consider this price too low.</p>
<p>Raw Silk—Chinese raw silk shipped to the United States is very small in quantity compared to Japanese silk, and prices are also restricted by official prices.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Fertilizer Shipped to China</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's relief agency (行總) collaborates with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in handling agricultural and fishery materials. Last year, the UNRRA shipped approximately 100,000 tons of agricultural and fishery materials, with fertilizer accounting for the majority and fishery equipment coming in second. However, the amount of fertilizer shipped by UNRRA has been decreasing, making it difficult for the ministry to allocate it. The demand for fertilizer in various regions is very urgent. UNRRA has telegraphed Washington, D.C., urging them to ship the full amount as soon as possible. It is reported that UNRRA may ship 3,000 tons of fertilizer to China this spring. The ministry has detailed plans for the utilization of agricultural machinery and will strive to implement them this year to increase agricultural production in various regions.</p>
<h3>Ample Cigarette Inventory, Market Prices Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market was stable, with the exception of Yizhong Company cigarettes, which were slightly popular, because the inventory of fellow merchants was ample and sales were not brisk.</p>
<p>Among daily necessities, Gu Ben and Arrow Brand soap had strong demand from local merchants, and prices continued to rise. Mei Li Feng Huang (Beautiful Phoenix) matches were scarce on the market, and prices were firm.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Requesting to Lay Off Workers, Social Affairs Bureau Lacks Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Amid the economic downturn, factories have made it through the Lunar New Year, but some factories have not yet resumed operations after the Spring Festival and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to approve layoffs. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has received more than ten applications from manufacturers to lay off workers in the past two days. The Social Affairs Bureau attaches great importance to this issue and is currently discussing countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Scarce Arrivals, Sellers Hesitant, High New Quotation for Jiaozuo Lump Coal</h3>
<p>The coal market for white coal Jiaozuo lump coal was characterized by scarce arrivals and sellers being hesitant. Therefore, the opening price was delayed. Yesterday, a high price of 840,000 yuan was quoted, an increase of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Later, it rose to 860,000 yuan, with strong demand. Other white coal Hongji lump coal, etc., followed the previous trend with no fluctuations. Transactions of bituminous coal Kaiping lump and fines were smooth, and market prices were stable. Coal briquettes from large and small factories all increased by 20,000 yuan per ton, with large factories quoting 380,000 yuan ex-factory and small factories quoting 360,000 yuan ex-factory.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Resumes Shipping South, Guangzhou Factories Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Previously, the suspension of cotton yarn shipments to the south led to the closure of over 300 textile factories in Guangzhou. Now that cotton yarn has resumed shipping south, yarn prices have fallen, and supply and demand are balanced. Many merchants from Southeast Asia have come to Guangzhou to order cloth, and the factories have resumed operations one after another.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee Actively Developing Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee, jointly organized by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Trust Company, and the China Silk Company, provides raw materials to the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture, which produces various types of silk fabrics. The committee then ships these fabrics to England, France, India, and Southeast Asia for sale to earn foreign exchange. The committee's work is now actively underway. It is reported that the cost of raw materials accounts for half of the export price of these manufactured goods, with the remainder being labor costs, which can double the foreign exchange earned compared to exporting raw silk alone. If China's total output of qualified raw silk this year reaches 30,000 bales, and half of it is used to weave silk fabrics for export, it can be worth US$30 million. For example, the committee's first phase of providing 1,400 bales of factory silk to the Joint Venture costs approximately US$1.12 million, and 2,400 cases of rayon cost approximately US$860,000, totaling US$1.98 million. After three months, over 80,000 bolts of wide-width export silk fabrics can be woven, which can be worth around US$5 million at current overseas market prices. The remaining US$3 million represents labor costs that can also be converted into foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Chinese English Studies Association Recently Purchased Land to Build Association Headquarters Awaits Solicitation of Members Before Formal Establishment</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 28th] The Chinese English Teaching Research Association, expanded and reorganized from the Ministry of Education's English Teaching Research Association, was initiated and planned by over 20 English professors and experts from Central University, Jinling University, and universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and other locations. Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, Vice Minister Hang, and Cao, Director of the Secondary Education Department, are all supporters. Qian Gechuan, a specialist member of the Ministry of Education, is in charge of the association's affairs and has held an initial meeting. The Ministry of Education has allocated 150 million yuan for the construction of the association's headquarters. It has recently purchased land in Lanjiazhuang, Chengxian Street, Nanjing, as the association's address and is planning the construction of the headquarters. It is awaiting the solicitation of English teachers from secondary schools and above across the country (or those who have served as English teachers for more than two years, and current English teachers who have been introduced and qualified, can join as members) to join as members before holding an inaugural conference. The association's initiators in Nanjing have been conducting research work in the past month and will publish a monthly magazine on English teaching in a short period, which will be a great help to those teaching English in secondary schools and above. The Ministry of Education's existing English teaching research institution will be abolished upon the formal establishment of the Chinese English Teaching Research Association.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Cultural Association Invited Xiao Qian to Lecture Yesterday Conducted Comparative Study of Chinese and British Writers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association held its first academic lecture yesterday (28th) at 5:30 PM at the association's new headquarters in the HSBC Building, presided over by Mr. Oxden, the British Consul-General in Shanghai. Xiao Qian, a professor at Fudan University, was invited to lecture on "Trends in British Novels in the Past 20 Years." Mr. Xiao reviewed the development of British novels from the end of World War I in 1919 to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the main characteristics of British novels during that period. He also briefly commented on the works of Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Forster, and Lawrence.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao compared and studied the intellectual and emotional state of Chinese writers with British writers, believing that there are some fundamental differences between the writers of the two countries. For example, British writers loathe machinery, while Chinese writers praise heavy industry; British writers such as Forster focus on private relationships, while Chinese writers regard this as a source of nepotism and corruption. Mr. Xiao concluded that the reason why Chinese and British writers have these differences is not due to the different languages, but because our country still needs to work hard to overthrow the "Corn Laws" and strive for the "Reform Act." The gap between China and Britain is at least one century.</p>

<h3>Two British Female Educators Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month to Give Public Academic Lectures in Various Places</h3>
<p>The British Council, in order to strengthen cultural ties between China and Britain, recently hired two renowned female educators from Britain, Dr. Clarke and Miss Greer, to come to China and give public academic lectures for four months. They are about to arrive in Hong Kong and will transfer to Shanghai. The British Council has sent a representative to Hong Kong to meet them, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month.

<p>Miss Lynda Greer developed a strong interest in economics and modern art at a young age. After graduating from the Department of Oriental Studies at Cambridge University, she worked at her alma mater. After the outbreak of World War I, she taught economics at Cambridge, becoming the first woman to teach at the university, which caused a sensation nationwide. In 1921, she became the principal of Margaret College at Oxford University.</p>
<p>Dr. Mary Clarke, a Scottish national, studied education and medieval and modern linguistics at Aberdeen University and Girton College, Cambridge University. Afterward, she served as the principal of Edinburgh Ladies' College and Manchester High School for Girls for a total of twenty-one years. In 1942, Aberdeen University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 1931, she was one of the British female principals who visited universities in Canada, and is thus well-known in educational circles around the world.</p>

<h3>London Actively Preparing for Next Year's World Games: Accommodation for 5,000 Athletes Becomes a Problem</h3>
<p>[Translated by our Editorial Office from Reuters, London] The next Olympic World Games will be held in London in 1948, from July 29th to August 14th. The World Games Organizing Committee has recently issued a formal announcement, initially announcing the details of the preparations, stating that 5,000 well-known athletes from 25 countries (Germany and Japan have not been invited) will participate in the competition. The accommodation problem for this large number of athletes must be resolved with the assistance of the government. It is expected that a new Olympic Village will be built specifically for athletes to reside in, but the government has not yet decided on the location. Organizational work has now begun. A new road is being paved from Wembley Station to the sports field, and special changing rooms, showers, and bathing facilities are also under construction. In addition, an open-air swimming pool and a special track for athletes are also planned to be built.</p>
<p>Torch Relay: The second difficult problem is to light the Olympic torch. This torch must continue to burn during the Games, regardless of wind, rain, or sunshine, and must be visible during the day, and only be extinguished on the closing day. The torch will be lit on Mount Olympus in Greece using a giant magnifying glass to capture sunlight, and then carried by athletes in running, cycling, and equestrian events in a relay race across the European continent, and finally placed in the sports field as a decoration for the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Building a New Village: But the most difficult problem to deal with is the accommodation and meals for the 5,000 athletes and staff. The construction of the Olympic Village does not seem to be a problem, but its location is still unknown. The choice of location must be based on the standard that all houses can be used for civilian or military purposes after the Games are closed. The new village must also be as close as possible to Wembley Station and the sports field. It has been suggested that the United States and other countries can use large postal ships to transport athletes to London and moor them on the Thames, allowing them to stay on board during the conference. The United States adopted this method during the 1928 World Games in Amsterdam, but the dock there was closer to the sports field, while the London dock is farther from Wembley.</p>
<p>Air Transportation: It is heard that the United States is currently considering using airplanes to transport athletes in batches during the competition. In this way, the food and accommodation problems of the athletes can be easily solved. This method is very convenient for amateur athletes who cannot leave their jobs for a long time, but athletes who can get a vacation oppose this method. Finally, there is a piece of news that all long-distance runners around the world do not want to hear, that Mr. Watterson, the British long-distance runner who won the European 10,000-meter race championship in Oslo, the capital of Norway last year, reiterated his determination not to participate in international competitions.</p>
<p>Competition Program: [British News Agency, London, 28th] Preparations for the World Games to be held in the United Kingdom next year have begun. The British government has established a committee to discuss the housing problem for the 5,000 athletes from all over the world, and it is generally expected that this is the biggest problem faced by the organizers. The sports program will include seventeen items such as equestrian, rowing, fencing, shooting, boxing, swimming, football, basketball, and weightlifting. Art competitions such as literature, sculpture, music, architecture, painting, and woodcut will also form part of the Games program as usual. Readjustment of the Executive Yuan</p>

<h3>US Policy Toward China: A Grand Debate!</h3>
<p>— Autumn Goose Sends from New York</p>
<p>Airsmail dispatch dated 14th</p>
<p>This is a speech from August 20th of last year, and it seems outdated. However, despite differing opinions, it still represents many Americans today. The participants' demeanor is also admirable. Since China is now moving in the direction of democracy, we must naturally learn their debate methods.</p>
<p>Organizer: American Air Forum (Radio Broadcasting Organization)</p>
<p>Debate Topic: What Should We Do About China?</p>
<p>Debaters: Forman (Harrison Forman), writer and explorer.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard (Dr. J. Spencer Kennard), former missionary to China.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley (Freda Utley), writer.</p>
<p>Dr. Kohlberg (Dr. Alfred Kohlberg), member of the American-China Policy Association.</p>
<p>Chairman: Dr. Ray (Dr. Joseph M. Ray), Director of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p>Reporter: Is our China policy leading to world peace? Should we withdraw? Should we side with one party? What should we do about China?</p>
<p>This important question is being discussed again today on your American Air Forum (applause).</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! From your capital city of the Shoreham Hotel, the Mutual Broadcasting Company is proud to present the pioneer of American free radio broadcasting services, the American Air Forum, founded eighteen years ago by Mr. Granik, a prosecutor and arbitrator. Every week, the American Air Forum raises important issues and invites people with the power to influence decisions to hold debates.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Granik is away on assignment, and we have specially invited a guest to serve as chairman, Dr. Ray, Director of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray: Good evening!</p>
<p>The verbal disputes in Paris are very fierce, and the gun battles in Asia continue. The blood-soaked land of China has no chance to dry. The Chinese have not seen peace for almost ten years. Today, there is no foreign enemy that unites all Chinese people against foreign aggression, but rather a civil war that tears China apart.</p>
<p>The basis of China's disputes is the long-term feud between the National Government and the Communist Party. Today, this feud seems farthest from being resolved. Our representative to China, Marshall, reportedly said last week that he has abandoned hope for a short-term solution. This morning, the Communist Party headquarters in Yan'an ordered full mobilization to wage a full-scale civil war against the National Government. They said that this decision was made to destroy the offensive of Marshal Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Our China policy, according to President Truman's statement when he sent General Marshall, is to help China rebuild into a unified and democratic nation by all possible means, capable of shouldering its responsibilities in the Pacific and as a member of the international family. There is no dispute over the purpose of this policy. However, informed members of American public opinion have great disputes over how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>One group believes that our policy only increases the conflict between Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the Communist Party. They believe that the State Department is strengthening what they call a fascist faction while pursuing this policy, and they believe that the Communist Party is a reformer.</p>
<p>They demand that we stop this policy and should aid the people of China, not aid a faction that they believe is unwilling to give the people basic democratic ideals.</p>
<p>Another group is equally resolute and equally familiar with the situation in China, and argues that we should continue to support the National Government as the greatest bulwark against Russian domination of the country. Their basis is our traditional open-door policy. They say that if the Communist Party gains power, this policy will be lost.</p>
<p>The entire American foreign policy in the Pacific is being questioned. It was in the Pacific that the seeds of war were planted. We must not go wrong now to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p>Tonight, the American Air Forum continues its important discussion on international issues, inviting four authorities with first-hand experience and understanding of the China issue. From their different opinions, we believe that you can obtain enough facts to form your own opinions.</p>
<p>Now, they are here. First, Ms. Utley, a well-known writer of many books on China. Ms. Utley! Please speak!</p>
<p>Ms. Utley: The situation in China today is similar to that of Spain before the Second World War in many ways. I think we should give our ally, the legitimate government of China, full and effective support to resist the red fascist spies who are trying to destroy China's independence and all hope for the development of a democratic country, in order to turn China into a vassal under Russian dictatorship. We should stop forcing the Chinese government to share power with the Moscow spies, the Chinese Communist Party, whose purpose is to keep China divided, weak, and poor, as long as the Chinese government is friendly to the United States.</p>
<p>The lessons we have learned in Europe should warn us not to be deceived again and not to be fooled again. We have already sold Mikolajczyk and the Poles, allowing the Russians to laugh at the Atlantic Charter throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Instead, we should use all our strength in the hands of China's true freedom fighters. When we assume that the Communist Party is a transformer of democracy, we are saying the opposite. Naturally, since we have recognized red terror and totalitarian dictatorship as being mixed with the word democracy, the reactionary elements within China have also raised their heads.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray: Thank you, Ms. Utley. Next, Mr. Forman, writer and explorer. Mr. Forman!</p>
<p>Mr. Forman: Dr. Ray, I believe that in the mess of Chinese politics, who is right and who is wrong is no longer worth discussing. The continued presence of American troops in China, against the wishes of millions of Chinese people (regardless of whether they are red, white, or blue in politics), can only be explained as an undisguised and blatant plan for our country to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.</p>
<p>Moreover, giving weapons and military transportation equipment to one Chinese faction to oppose another Chinese faction is not only a hypocritical act that is exactly contrary to our mediation mission, but also fundamentally immoral no matter how it is measured.</p>
<p>If I were to give those weapons to the Chinese Communist Party, I would also consider it equally immoral. Because in the end, you cannot explain handing a gun to one Chinese person to let him kill his Chinese compatriots, regardless of who is right and who is wrong in their mutual quarrel.</p>
<p>Let us return the Chinese people to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray: Thank you, Mr. Forman. Next, Mr. Kohlberg, a member of the American-China Policy Association. Mr. Kohlberg!</p>
<p>Mr. Kohlberg: Basically, Dr. Ray, the situation in China is extremely simple. Germany is the first, and China is the second, in Russia's process of conquering the world. Conquering Germany is for its industry; conquering China is for its manpower. The Chinese Communist Party, like the Communist Party anywhere, is a trained tool of Moscow. The question facing the United States today is whether to help Russia conquer China or to adhere to America's traditional foreign policy, namely, the open door and the independence and territorial integrity of China.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray: Thank you, Mr. Kohlberg. Now, Dr. Kennard, a missionary who has been to China. Dr. Kennard!</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard: Let us admit that the Russians believe that their own way of life is good, just as the British and Americans believe that the British and American way of life is good, and the question is how to spread that particular philosophy. I believe that the method we are currently using to maintain the reputation of the United States is very bad. We are now arming fascist factions, which will turn against the United States in the future. Forcing the Chinese people to take the path of communism, so that the Chinese people have no way to avoid foreign (American) military domination except for this, is very bad. Stopping normal economic activities (trade) and stipulating what kind of government form the Chinese must have, making the civil war never stop, is also very bad for the United States. We need those happy 500 million customers. Expanding a war in Asia, as we are doing today, giving encouragement to stubborn factions, is very bad for the United States. This war may become global. World War III has already begun!</p>
<h3>China Has Russia Behind It; Russia Attempts to Wrestle America Out</h3>
<p>Chairman Ray—Thank you, Ms. Utley and gentlemen. Now the problem is clear, and the positions of both sides are understood.</p>
<p>To start the discussion, Mr. Foreman, do you think we should withdraw from China?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Dr. Ray, a resounding "yes." Involving Russia in the China issue is like adding a red herring to the picture. Unless we are willing to stain our hands with the blood of 50,000 innocent Chinese people, who will and have already died under American-made guns and bombs, let us withdraw from China, and quickly!</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—Ms. Utley!</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I would like to ask the two gentlemen on the other side, especially Mr. Foreman, a question, because they have spoken about strengthening the military power of the Fascist faction. Before we continue the discussion, I think we should first clarify what they mean by Fascist. So I would like to ask Mr. Foreman if he agrees with Mr. Ehrenberg's definition: that anyone who opposes Communist Russia is a Fascist. If so, do you believe that any Chinese and Americans who oppose Russian aggression or domination are Fascists?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Ms. Utley, Mr. Ehrenberg's and your definition of Fascist reminds me of the current American definition of Communist? Today, anyone who disagrees with you is a Communist.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I asked if you agree with Mr. Ehrenberg's definition. I never said I agreed with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I disagree with Mr. Ehrenberg, and I disagree with you.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Could you please give your definition of Fascist? I mean when you use that term in relation to China.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—A Fascist is someone who does not give people a democratic way of life.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Then the Chinese Communists are also Fascists, because they follow Russia, and Russia completely denies people a democratic way of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I agree in part. The Chinese Communists, according to my definition, may be partially Fascist, but I disagree with your statement that they have any connection with Russia.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Dr. Ray, it seems to me that we have already reached the heart of the matter. Mr. Foreman believes that the Chinese Communists have no connection with Russia. However, from 1921 until the Comintern was ostensibly dissolved in 1943, they were members of the Comintern. They could not have been members for so long unless they were extremely disciplined and obedient.</p>
<p>Moreover, I would like to read to Mr. Foreman what the boss or dictator of the Chinese Communist Party, if you will call him that, that is, Mao Zedong, Mr. Foreman's hero, himself said: "The whole world today expects Communism to be their savior, and so does China. The conflict between socialist Soviet Russia and imperialist Britain and America is becoming increasingly tight. If China does not stand on this side, it must stand on that side."</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Mr. Colberg, I personally applaud Mr. Mao Zedong for being so frank in expressing his views. But what you read was said by Mr. Mao Zedong some time ago. Few people in the United States know what Chiang Kai-shek said two years ago in "China's Destiny." Anyone who has read that book says it is the most xenophobic work ever published in China. This "China's Destiny," with Chiang's approval, is required reading for millions of Chinese people, just like Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in Germany. But—</p>
<p>Ms. Utley (interrupting)—Please pay attention, Mr. Foreman!</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—But in America, they don't allow people to read it. Please forgive me for a moment. Let me finish this, okay? Here, in the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C., there is an English translation of "China's Destiny," but it is marked "Top Secret."</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I want to say that we have strayed from the topic. Naturally, a country like China, which has suffered from the aggression of various powers for a hundred years, will inevitably have a certain degree of xenophobia. The problem today is that it is completely wrong to say that millions of Chinese people want Americans to withdraw from China, as you two have said. My experience in China is exactly the opposite. You may have heard that the first American journalists to arrive in Manchuria were welcomed by the local residents, who patted their epaulets and asked them to save them from the Russians and the Communists.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—May I show you a photo, Ms. Utley, of 100,000 students in Shanghai demonstrating against the American troops in Shanghai, demanding that they withdraw from China.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—You can do anything.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard (interrupting)—May I add that even in my school, West China University, in order to get students to demonstrate against Russia, the president had to first grant a thirty-day vacation to those who were willing to participate.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Mr. Foreman, you told me that 100,000 people in Shanghai demonstrated against the government. Where else…</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I didn't say they were against the government, I said they were against the U.S. military staying in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Yes, and also against the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I didn't say they were against the government, Mr. Colberg.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Outside of China, which Fascist country has ever had 100,000 people demonstrate against the government's policies?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—That's a strange way of arguing, Mr. Colberg, you're twisting things. What I'm saying is that the Chinese people don't want the U.S. military stationed in China, you can't twist that into saying that there is democracy in Chiang Kai-shek's government.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Did you ever agree to give up the war against Japan? Because Wang Jingwei represented many of those who advocated "letting the Chinese run their own affairs." Why should we fight Japan? Are you willing to let China be ruled by a Japanese puppet?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Please make it clear, who are we still fighting in China today?</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—As I have explained, we all know perfectly well that Russia is behind it. Russia is trying to wrestle America out, close the door to China, and make China part of its totalitarian empire.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I agree with you, the situation is just like in Spain; unfortunately, we replaced Hitler and Mussolini with armed intervention.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Good heavens! Did we ever go to Manchuria to plunder? Did we move machinery from Manchuria? Did we do those things? Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Are you willing to compare Russian looting with American murder? The American navy is killing Chinese people.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Please pay attention! Did you ever approve of lending arms to Russia? It is now not only using these arms against its own people, but also against our allies of yesterday!</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—Please wait a moment. Let us bring Dr. Kennard into the process here and let him answer a question addressed to him. Do you believe that the principles of open door and territorial integrity should still be the basis of future American foreign policy towards China?</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—I most certainly believe that the open door is the policy we should pursue in China. However, I now see that we are forcing the Chinese to implement a government and an economic system of our choosing, which in fact results in closing the door. The 500 million people who could be American customers in times of peace and normal open door policies are today being forced to boycott American goods, and the past open door policy will no longer exist.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Dr. Kennard, you should leave the business matters to me. That's my line of work. Your line of work is religion. May I suggest that we don't have to be too upset about the problem of 500 million customers. We will wait until the iron curtain replaces the open door, as the Communists have already done in North China and the Northeast, and then there will be no need to worry about customers anymore.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Mr. Colberg, the difficulty is that today our merchants with pistols hidden on their bodies are bound to force the Chinese to do business with guns, and this kind of rogue behavior can easily cause riots, worldwide riots, and many innocent bystanders will be killed by atomic bombs in Kirkuk, Odessa, Coventry, and Marseille.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I have never seen such a reversal of right and wrong, using force to force people to buy things! The Chinese, whether rich or poor, are in desperate need of goods and trade after eight years of war against Japan, and the Communists are blocking trade by destroying railways. The problem is entirely that they cannot afford the American goods they desperately need.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—I simply cannot agree, Ms. Utley. We are keeping China in a state of chaos, because if peace is to be achieved in China today, the question is whether to allow the Chinese themselves to continue to maintain the only semblance of democracy in some Chinese villages and cities? The only issue in dispute between the Communists and the central government is whether some areas, such as those in which we Americans have elected county magistrates and local officials, will be allowed to continue to exist in a democratic form?</p>
<h3>Ms. Utley's Challenge: Clarify the True Path to Democratization</h3>
<p>Ms. Utley—You call that democracy? In a place where only one party is allowed to exist, as in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists?—Only one party, one newspaper, one radio broadcast, only the Communist Party!</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—Please forgive me, I know from all my investigations, and Mr. Foreman can testify.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I've been there too.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—In every place controlled by the Communist Party, I have always investigated this point again and again. I have also been to Shanghai…</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I challenge you to name any newspaper or radio station other than the Communist Party's in the Communist area.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—The key is, when the majority of people in the whole village voted for a newspaper or a radio broadcast, can this newspaper and radio still be called Communist?</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Please pay attention, Dr. Kennard. I have lived in Russia, I understand this.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—China is different from Russia. I don't know about Russia. But I know that in these areas of China (Communist areas), they have democracy.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Here comes the red herring again!</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—This is not a red herring.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—Are we going to talk about whether the problem in China is really communism?</p>
<p>Ms. Utley, here is a question for you to answer. If communism is the real problem, why does the central government ban the Democratic League or liberals, even those industrialists who oppose dictatorship?</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—First, I do not agree with this statement. The Democratic League is a small group of dissatisfied intellectuals who follow the Communist line. The much larger and more important political parties are independent, such as the Youth Party, which opposes the government in some places, but agrees with the government on the point of opposing the Communist Party. It is not true to say that the government has banned the Democratic League, etc. In the capital of China, half of the newspapers are against the government, and the other half are also against the government half the time. In the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists, you cannot find anyone who is allowed to say a word against the government!</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—You're right, Ms. Utley, they don't need to ban those Communist liberals who disagree with Chiang Kai-shek—they just carry out assassinations. Read your newspaper!</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Does this mean that the United States has no democracy, because some people "lynch" criminal black people?</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—It's not a question of "lynching" a few black people.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—That hasn't stopped the progress of American democracy. I'm not saying that China is already a democratic country. I am saying that China wants to become a democratic country under Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—China cannot become a democratic country under Chiang Kai-shek's faction, because those factions are the result of the combination of landlords, which will be automatically resolved.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley (interrupting)—Do you support resolving the landlords?</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—I don't support resolving anyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—Dr. Kennard, I don't understand what you mean by trying to convince the audience here that any Communist area has democracy. A year ago, you might have been able to do it. Today, it's going to be hard work to convince the audience of that.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—Here is a question related to this point, addressed to you. Why are all Chinese students in the United States only allowed to study science courses?</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—That's not the case. I know many Chinese students who are studying literature and social sciences (various liberal arts). The wording of that question is wrong.</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—Too many are studying literature and social sciences. They need to study science to build the country. This is the only reasonable way. They have very little money, and they desperately need engineers and the like, and doctors, more than they need lawyers.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennard—They need all kinds of people. But you know perfectly well, Ms. Utley, that Chinese students must first be carefully examined before they come to the United States to see if they are in line with the way of thinking of Chen Lifu—and his faction. After they arrive, their courses are also closely monitored. There are hundreds of detectives scattered among the students on our Columbia Hill (the location of Columbia University).</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—You should go to a Communist country first, experience the real taste, Dr. Kennard, taste a little tyranny!</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—I happen to have something on this issue. In front of me, there is an English translation of a Chinese Ministry of Education document regarding the management of students studying in the United States, Article 14…</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg (interrupting)—When was it?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—November 14, 1943. Article 14 states, "During their stay in the United States, students studying at their own expense should accept the guidance and control of the inspectorate of the embassy regarding their thoughts and actions."</p>
<p>Mr. Colberg—I would like to talk about these "reactionaries and fascists" in China. I know them. Among them are two famous generals, often mentioned by people on your side, General He Yingqin and General Zhao Lin (?). They are all my friends, and I have dealt with them.</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—I'm sorry, Mr. Colberg, time is up. If we can stop for a moment, let's summarize tonight's arguments. Mr. Foreman, can you summarize your side's views?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman—Dr. Ray, I think the important thing for us is to decide what the current problem in China is. The "anti-Russian" people in the United States are putting in too much effort. I'm not explaining for the Russians, but I still insist that the red herring should not be dragged into the China picture. The question is, should we stay in China?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "New York Times" had a telegram, and this morning, the "New York Times" had another telegram, saying that a New York Times reporter visited the American Navy stationed in China, and according to the answer, they themselves did not know what they were doing in China, and they wanted to leave China very much. I clipped it out, and the headline is "Navy is unaware of their work in China. Many are said to sympathize with the Communist Party." The article says: "The Navy has expressed its disappointment with the current Kuomintang government and its institutions, and most notably (this is important to me) that despite the fact that they are often attacked, insulted, kidnapped, and even have their lives endangered while carrying out their missions in China, most of the American Navy secretly sympathizes with the crisis faced by the Communist Party. (The Navy is certainly not Communist) They believe that the situation today could not be worse."</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—I'm sorry. Your time is up, Mr. Foreman. Ms. Utley, can you summarize your side's views?</p>
<p>Ms. Utley—I think the other side's arguments are mostly focused on whether the Chinese government is democratic. I have never said it is democratic, and I don't think it is democratic now, but I insist that this is the only government in China that can achieve democracy. If we only talk about how incompletely democratic it is, I think it is beyond the scope. No country that has experienced what China has experienced in recent years can be democratic immediately.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman often talks about the red herring that we brought to the table. To summarize our point of view, I dare say that we believe the red herring is already there, big and stinking!</p>
<p>I would like to answer this navy question. Because a few months ago, I was still in the American military area in North China, and I returned across the Pacific by American military plane. My experience is completely different from that reporter's. Almost every naval officer and soldier I talked to said, "Do you think we should stay here? It's obvious that Russia wants to take on America."</p>
<p>They know it very well. They have only heard the Communist Party radio from Yan'an say that the difference between the two imperialisms, the U.S. and Japan, is that the U.S. is stronger and more civilized on the surface. The naval officers and soldiers, I know them, I was with them everywhere I traveled in North China for two months, they are absolutely resentful of what Russia is doing. They know the situation very well, that Russia is behind the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The main point, I think, has not been discussed sufficiently, and has not actually been talked about, is how will the situation change if the United States withdraws its support for its ally, the Chinese government? The other side often avoids this point, they neither explain it nor admit it. If it is to return China to the Chinese people, I absolutely agree with them. That would be the best thing. But according to our experience in Europe, this is to hand China over to Russia and its puppet, the "Chinese Communist Party!"</p>
<p>Chairman Ray—I'm sorry, our time is up. (Applause)</p>
<p>What you have heard is the American Air Forum, a debate on "What Should We Do About China." The speakers are Mr. Foreman, writer and explorer; Dr. Kennard, former missionary in China; Ms. Utley, a famous writer who has written many books about China (referring to "Japan's Feet of Clay," etc.—Editor's note); Mr. Colberg, member of the American Association for the Criticism of Chinese Policy. We welcome you to write to us if you wish. This is your reporter, Mr. Carl Bates.</p>
<p>Reporter—Thank you, Dr. Ray!</p>

<h3>Italian Fascism Returns - Giannini: A Second Mussolini?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Xi from This Week magazine</p>
<p>In Italy today, there is a stout, red-haired former Fascist member who, with great ambition, is actively organizing his own political party, preparing to take on the Italian government. This man is the editor and commentator Giannini. He dresses neatly in short shirts and sportswear, wears a monocle, carries an automatic pistol at his waist, and walks with the swagger of a German army major.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Giannini met with a reporter from the United Press, blaming Roosevelt for the outbreak of World War II. Recently, rumors have circulated that someone intends to harm him. When another reporter asked for his thoughts on this, he patted the pistol at his side and said, "I have this fellow as my bodyguard!"</p>
<p>The insightful Italian political commentator Alfarro once told me, "Despite people's fears about the Soviet Union, communism will not immediately gain an advantage in Italy. The real crisis in Italy today is a new form of fascism." Recent events have proven his words to be true. A new fascist party is expanding and may soon seize power.</p>
<p>Decline of Communist Prestige</p>
<p>One night last April, four people broke into a cemetery near Milan, stole Mussolini's body, and left a letter stating, "The leader is with us again. Soon the leader lying in the coffin will parade on the streets of Italy..." The letter was signed "Democratic Fascist Party."</p>
<p>Now these grave robbers are in jail; but recently in Gorizia, crowds shouted "Leader!" and tried to disrupt an anti-fascist demonstration. This emerging fascist party is not operating underground but is active in public.</p>
<p>The Italian Communist Party was originally unaffected by setbacks. However, when Stalin supported Tito's demands for Trieste, which the Italians were unwilling to cede, he destroyed the pillar of the Italian Communist Party. As a result, the Communist Party's prestige declined, and in the election for the Republican Constituent Assembly, it received only 4,284,000 votes out of 28 million, less than 20 percent of the total. The Socialist Party received over 387,000 votes. But Giannini's new fascist party, the "Common Man's Front," surprisingly won 1,198,000 votes, 30 seats in the Constituent Assembly, only five votes less than Mussolini obtained in the last election before his march on Rome in 1922.</p>
<p>New fascist groups are spreading throughout Italy, with Giannini's party being the most powerful, mixed with many old Fascist members of Mussolini, totaling about two million people. Professor Peri, a guerrilla leader who served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945, criticized them as "not a political party, just a mob. They are a disorganized group of discontented people, likely to be agitators for another totalitarian regime."</p>
<p>Their starting point is Giannini's "Common Man" weekly newspaper. Published in Rome, it has an average circulation of 500,000 copies per issue, sometimes reaching 800,000, making it the best-selling newspaper in Italy. The newspaper is filled with defamatory and abusive language, maliciously attacking the government, the United Nations, and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Life's Greatest Hatred: Democracy</p>
<p>Giannini, editor of the "Common Man" weekly, advocates organizing an "administrative" state directed by "common people" rather than "politicians." Giannini is an eloquent speaker. His gestures are lively and his tone is impassioned when he speaks. He hates democracy with a passion. He and his followers favor a strong leader who uses decisive means to govern the country.</p>
<p>At this moment, Giannini has not yet used iron-fisted policies, but most Italians have joined his party. This does not mean that Italians do not need democracy; on the contrary, most of them are working hard to achieve it, but Italy's new democratic government is divided and unable to solve various problems, causing them to become disillusioned with it. Under the threat of chaos and the approach of winter, the Italian people yearn for urgent relief.</p>
<p>The core of Italy's entire reconstruction problem lies in the food issue. To obtain food, Italy's industry must produce agricultural tools for domestic use and manufacture goods for export. To get factories running, coal is needed. However, Italy cannot even mine the 120,000 tons of coal it can produce each month because miners have to stop working and beg for food to feed their families. Italy's bread ration has been reduced by half, and Italians receive fewer calories per day than the people of any other country in Europe.</p>
<p>Italy: Past and Present</p>
<p>Once the new fascism raises its head, the history of the past will inevitably repeat itself today. Twenty-five years ago, Mussolini convened the first Fascist Party Congress in Rome. At that time, the nation was deeply resentful of unfavorable peace terms, and the Fascist Party seized this opportunity, calling for relief from unemployment and inflation, and recruited thousands of members. In less than a year, Mussolini's armed march moved towards Rome, and Mussolini leaped to become Prime Minister of Italy.</p>
<p>Dr. Curley, an American problem expert and aide to the late President Roosevelt, who lived in Italy for two months, recently said, "The general economic conditions that led to the rise of fascism still exist in Italy today. Just as after World War I, Italians today are denied the right to control Trieste and Fiume in the peace treaty. France has taken away small pieces of land in northern Italy. Italians feel that their declaration of war against Germany and their contribution to the victory of the United Nations should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Just as in 1921, Italy is currently experiencing inflation and widespread unemployment. The country has a population of only 45 million, but 2.2 million people are unemployed. Strikes and riots are increasing daily. Last autumn, thousands of unemployed people in Rome besieged the Viminale Palace, the seat of government. Afterwards, the police authorities found that the instigators of the riot were two Fascist members. The current government cannot prevent riots, just as in 1921.</p>
<p>A Second Mussolini?</p>
<p>Under all these circumstances, Giannini's "Common Man's Front" is likely to become the dominant political party in Italy. On October 28, the anniversary of the march on Rome, thousands of Fascist members carried black flags and handmade bombs.</p>
<p>Giannini gives me the impression of being almost entirely a second Mussolini. With the qualifications of a third-rate playwright, he was appointed editor of a film magazine in 1926, held a minor position in the propaganda department in 1930, and officially joined the Fascist Party in 1941.</p>
<p>A few months after the fall of Rome in 1944, Giannini first published the "Common Man" weekly as his mouthpiece. The first issue had a print run of 20,000 copies, which sold out on the same day and was reprinted three times. For a time, the whole country followed suit, and the government became very wary and prosecuted him on charges of being a Fascist, advising him to suspend his newspaper temporarily. At the same time, the British Parliament strongly condemned Giannini. But the Italian court acquitted him.</p>
<p>Giannini has the support of two wealthy brothers who hope to restore the monarchy because the monarchy supported Mussolini and made them rich. Giannini's "Common Man's Front" convened its first national congress and joined the monarchist party.</p>
<p>Italy's Only Hope</p>
<p>Italy's political parties are self-serving and disunited. If the parties do not unite early, Giannini may have a successful day.</p>
<p>Currently, Italy's only hope rests with the current Prime Minister Gasperi, a courageous anti-fascist who leads Italy's most powerful party, the Christian Democratic Party. Unfortunately, Gasperi represented Italy at the peace conference and failed to win favorable peace terms, missing the opportunity to restore Italy's prestige. He is now seeking a compromise with the style of a capable diplomat to maintain his precarious cabinet. However, the most important thing is to solve the problem of people's food and curb inflation. He believes that after the East is settled, Italy must obtain assistance from abroad to maintain factory production, otherwise fascism will inevitably return.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the United Nations</p>
<p>Why does the United Nations allow the new fascist party to grow in an Allied-occupied country? That is because the fascist party's discipline is usually lax, and it cannot be suppressed except for a few key figures. Moreover, the publication of the "Common Man" newspaper was permitted by a new cabinet control mechanism in Italy, and the Allied forces have given up their control over this mechanism.</p>
<p>So far, Giannini has not done anything that would warrant Allied intervention. However, if he does launch a coup, then according to the armistice treaty, British and American troops can immediately move out. Apart from this, the only way to prevent Italy from suffering again is to help its people rebuild a sound and prosperous country.</p>
<p>— Giannini, the new Fascist leader under the shadow of Mussolini's specter</p>

<h3>The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Opens - The German and Austrian Peace Treaties Have Begun!</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened in London on the 14th, presided over by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who personally extended a welcome to the Deputy Foreign Ministers of various countries, hoping that the situation that would allow Germany to make a comeback would not be created again in the future. Starting from the 15th, the draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria will be officially discussed, and an agenda will be prepared for the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held in Moscow on March 10. Therefore, this Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting is actually the prelude to the German and Austrian peace talks. Standing at the beginning of 1947, we have to express our earnest expectations for the first international conference this year. Because this meeting has a very important relationship to the development of the international situation in the future.</p>
<p>The German and Austrian Issues Will Be Dealt With Separately</p>
<p>Germany is the culprit of World War II, and the Allied countries should severely punish Germany, order it to compensate for the losses suffered by various countries, and at the same time pay special attention to the re-education of its people, so as to eliminate the anesthesia and residual poison of the Nazis received by the people, and make it also become a peace-loving country, no longer threatening the peace and security of Europe. As for Austria, she is the victim of Hitler's aggression, and the Allied countries should assume the obligation to help her independence. Not only must its independence be allowed in words and writing, but it should also be given economic assistance in practice to make it a stable force in Central Europe, a bridge between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, so the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' discussion of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria will take the method of discussing them every other day, so that they can be dealt with separately.</p>
<p>Britain Proposes a Plan for Austria</p>
<p>The German and Austrian issues are the most complicated issues in Europe today. The four major powers do not agree on this, that is, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Czech Republic and other countries have their own opinions, and before the opening of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting, they have successively issued memorandums, putting forward many requirements on political and economic terms, making the work of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting even more difficult. We predict that the German issue will not be easily resolved for a while, and it will not be possible to have a successful agreement until the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting. However, the opinions of the major powers on the Austrian issue are relatively close, and it is not difficult to establish a solution plan. The draft peace treaty proposed by the British representative is expected to be adopted in principle, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Restore the free and independent Austria; (2) All Allied troops stationed in Austria should withdraw and return home; (3) Freedom of navigation on the Danube River; (4) Allow Austria to join the United Nations organization as a member state; (5) Restore the boundaries of Austria in 1938; (6) Do not recognize the territorial demands on Austria put forward by South Czech Republic; (7) Do not demand reparations; (8) Freedom of religion, freedom of trade, and no discrimination.

<p>The French Political Situation - Britain and France Conclude an Alliance</p>
<p>The French National Congress and the Senate held a joint meeting on the 16th to elect the President of the French Republic. The leader of the Socialist Party, O Lihe, was elected with an absolute majority of 452 votes; the Blum Cabinet, which had just returned from London, submitted its resignation to President O Lihe in accordance with the provisions of the French Constitution. O Lihe then appointed Lai Madiai, an important figure in the Socialist Party, as Prime Minister to discuss cabinet formation with all parties. The new cabinet was established with the joint support of various parties, and from then on, the French political system also came to an end of the provisional regime and embarked on the right track of democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<h3>The Arab World in Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Cheng Cong</p>
<p>The Middle East is in a time of trouble. In the newspapers, we read about all kinds of turmoil, such as the Palestine bombing case, the riots in Cairo, and the demonstrations spreading in various Arab countries. The situation in the Middle East has a great impact on the world, and it can determine what kind of world we and the next generation will live in, because in these disturbances, the interests of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States directly clash. Millions of Arabs, in this era of rebirth, are in turmoil, and have not yet decided where to go: to the East, or to the West? To communism, or to democracy?</p>
<p>Arabs are undergoing drastic changes. In Damascus, there are girls wearing veils and studying in the inner chambers, while modern women next door are wearing the most fashionable Hollywood costumes, driving their own cars, and going to the city to participate in women's conferences to fight for women's suffrage.</p>
<p>The chiefs of the desert-dwelling river people wield the power of life and death over a people. When happy, they can burn their wives and concubines to death with fire, and sometimes after killing people like this, they take a plane to Cairo to pray to the teachers.</p>
<p>In a certain city in Syriac Arab City, the entire process of the Industrial Revolution is displayed. On the one hand, there are weavers weaving cloth with old-fashioned looms behind the kiln-style shops. The daily income is only worth five U.S. dollars. On the other hand, at the other end of the same area, there is a modern spinning mill with 1,200 workers and the latest machines, as well as self-service restaurants, showers, hospitals, and dormitory facilities.</p>
<p>Outside most cities in the Middle East, feudalism still exists. The entire village and town often belongs to a landlord. He and other chiefs unite. Many chiefs of the same level then pledge allegiance to the larger chiefs. But there are also some progressive places. Like in Iraq, where the feudal situation is the worst, the chiefs have 100,000 acres of limited good land. The Iraqi government does not have the power to confiscate these properties, so it implements a plan to divide the wasteland downstream of the Tigris into farms with an area of 85 acres per plot, and distribute them to people who are willing to cultivate them for free. After five years, this field will be his property.</p>
<p>What needs to be improved is the labor aspect. Arab workers still have no legal protection. Child labor is also not restricted by law. The excellent and famous Oriental carpets are woven by the tender hands of child laborers. They sit on the narrow planks in front of the loom, step on the loom with their feet, and work for more than ten hours a day, causing skeletal malformation. The factory owner treats the factory as a school, and education is compulsory. One and a half hours a day is spent reading, writing and arithmetic, and nine and a half hours is spent weaving carpets.</p>
<p>Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, almost all Arabs in Palestine were illiterate. Now 120,000 people are enrolled in school. There is a university in Jerusalem. In the past 25 years, Egypt has established two national universities.</p>
<p>Oppose Judaism - Distrust the British Empire</p>
<p>The Arabs do not trust British imperialism. In the past, the entire Arab economy was controlled by the British, and foreign trade was mostly limited to British goods. Although they themselves admit that once the British forces withdraw, the impact will not be beneficial, they always want to obtain the opportunity for self-determination.</p>
<p>They have even deeper resentment towards France. In the process of entrusting the rule of Le Pono and Syria, France used force to deal with the Arabs and even bombed Damascus in 1945. All kinds of measures have long made France's connection with the Middle East desperate.</p>
<p>The Arab world is extremely opposed to Judaism. The Palestine issue is difficult to resolve peacefully. Various Arab countries are very united. After the riots in Cairo, there were demonstrations everywhere. France's actions in Damascus stimulated the entire Arab world to erupt. Judaism has further united the Arabs.</p>
<p>Where are the Arabs going? Turning to the Soviet Union? The Soviet Union is indeed paying very close attention to the Arab states. In every city, the scale of the Soviet embassy is larger than that of the British and American embassies, although its commercial relations are smaller than those of Britain and the United States. Every Soviet embassy is the Soviet Union's propaganda center. Recently, the Kremlin seems to be very concerned about the Muslims in the Soviet Union, and is doing everything possible to link them with the Arab Muslims. Many Soviet people have also participated in the Islamic University in Cairo.</p>
<p>Eastern culture originated in Arabia. When the followers of Muhammad united the peoples of the southeastern Mediterranean to form a single religious empire 1,200 years ago, Arab culture reached its peak, but later it was conquered by foreign peoples. In the four hundred years of Turkish rule, progress was halted. The period when Western culture flowed into Arabia was still stagnant.</p>
<p>World War I gave Arabia the opportunity to resist Turkey. They fought side by side with the Allied Powers, believing that they could gain freedom. However, after the war, the Allied Powers Conference entrusted Palestine, Outer Jordan, and Iraq to British rule, and Syria and Lebanon to French rule. Egypt became a British protectorate.</p>
<p>The Arabs have opposed this rule. The result of the negotiations was that they gained little and did not achieve true independence. After World War II, Britain and France still wanted to stay there. The Arabs expressed that they were not welcome. Now the British and French forces are withdrawing, leaving part of the gap.</p>
<p>During the war, the United States provided them with material assistance. Now only commercial airlines and educational undertakings remain. (Translated from Reader's Digest)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Style of Women</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>More than 2,000 years ago, King Fuchai of Wu and King He　of Wu left behind many beautiful stories in the city of Suzhou. One of the famous women in Chinese history, Xi Shi, spent her youth here; more than 2,000 years later, the city is densely covered with river ports, ponds and ancient wells, overgrown with jasmine, roses and violets, and everywhere is clear water and lush flowers. Water and flowers symbolize the temperament of the men and women who grow here.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan is a typical Suzhou woman. Her work "Microwave Words" is a manifestation of a skillful and feminine style. Her narrow circle of life reminds us of caged finches and goldfish in glass tanks.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the language of poetry, or from the point of view of the form of poetry, Jiang Yan is still stuck in the stage of the May Fourth era. She has been too influenced by old poems and cannot get rid of the constraints of those outdated words, and even wrote such empty and obscure sentences as "Like the ancient flying dragon galloping, I laughed at the swiftness of the falcon in high autumn" (Ode to the Air Force). In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, her language and style have a kind of liberation that can more freely express her emotions and vividly describe her materials, but the liberation has a limit, just like people who bind their feet cannot fully restore the natural beauty after removing the foot-binding cloth.</p>
<p>The real world is so vast, and the real society is so rich, Jiang Yan only lives in an environment beautified by her own imagination, so she writes:</p>
<p>Bottled flowers linger with a gentle fragrance,</p>
<p>The soft quilt is also all gentle.</p>
<p>A slight illness has a leisurely taste.</p>
<p>The whispers beside the embroidered pillow are low,</p>
<p>Some warmth, some pitying eyes,</p>
<p>Today you have more gentleness,</p>
<p>Your voice is lower and lower</p>
<p>I can't hear clearly, what, a kiss?</p>
<p>Darling, you can, but be gentle,</p>
<p>"A slight illness has a leisurely taste" can best summarize Jiang Yan's ideology, fully showing her aesthetic and hedonistic tendencies. In ancient times, Xi Shi was appreciated because of her morbidity, but today, Chinese intellectual women have progressed to taking disease as their own enjoyment!</p>
<p>A poet must have a philosophical foundation in his thoughts to achieve the fullness of content, to enter the realm of art, and to deeply understand the true meaning of life. And she only has the tender love of young children, and this kind of love does not allow her to have the opportunity to calmly observe the real world and the real society when she is engaged in poetry creation.</p>
<p>The tenderness of women may be determined by physiological conditions, and the atmosphere of tenderness in the works of female poets may be unavoidable, and even unnecessary, but too much tenderness is undoubtedly a serious morbidity for a woman, and it is even more a strong anesthetic for poetic art. In addition to giving satisfaction to readers with abnormal psychology, it has no meaning whatsoever.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan has described the Anti-Japanese War, although the description is so conceptualized and so alienated, it can actually be regarded as a kind of progress, and it is not entirely futile. After this kind of attempt, or rather test, she should know how far away she is from this scientific and mass era? And how incompatible is the skillful style with this arduous and magnificent national war!</p>
<p>Female writers and female poets often exude lofty motherhood in their works. Maternal love is a kind of purely giving love. When we read Bing Xin's "To Young Readers", it is as if our mother or sister is talking to us kindly. The tenderness that Jiang Yan expresses is only feminine. In the poem "Infant", she tries to express maternal love, which is not only forced, but also completely in the tone of an adult, without a trace of the natural outpouring of maternal love.</p>
<p>"Microwave Words" and its author are lonely, just like a potted flower, blooming lonely and falling lonely in a greenhouse, emitting fragrance lonely, only people who live in the greenhouse appreciate it.</p>
<p>From the Saturn Pen Club to the Chinese Poetry and Art Society, this group of them has always had a group of poets with aesthetic tendencies, and now, the organization itself is completely disintegrating, which makes people feel a sense of the past and the present. Sun Wangchang, Ren Xia, Zai Mingzhu, Lin Yongquan and Jiang Yan were the five most promising poets in the Chinese Poetry and Art Society. For the sake of readers and for the Chinese poetry movement, I hope they develop their own new bottom roads.</p>
<p>I heard that the bell in Hanshan Temple in Suzhou was stolen during the period when the enemy and puppets occupied the area. I think this is a symbol that Suzhou should end its past history and start a new page of life.</p>
<p>I hope that in Suzhou ten years from now, chimneys that are as dense as forests will stand on this flat field, and countless factories will be opened to build for China's industrialization, and the residents of Suzhou will no longer be intoxicated by the gentle and leisurely mood, but will walk out of the narrow circle of life and work hard to engage in production. I wish the poet Jiang Yan and her hometown well.</p>
<h3>Casual Chat on Couplets</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Although couplets are a minor art, there is much to appreciate in them. Yu Quyuan said: "Couplets are the most difficult. One must possess both boldness and elegance to create a masterpiece." He cited two couplets as examples. One, a couplet from the Five-Story Pagoda in Guangdong, reads: "For countless eons, this precarious tower has stood; I ask, who plucked stars from the Dipper, casting a disdainful gaze upon the past and present? Where are the ancient lords of five hundred years ago? Only I lean on the railing, gazing at swords, shedding tears for heroes!" The other, a couplet from the Guanyin Pavilion on Yuexiu Mountain, reads: "Manifesting the incarnation of the Great Being, I ask, in whom does the karmic connection to immortals and Buddhas reside? Lamenting the relics of King Yue, from ancient times, heroes have inspired much emotion." This was composed by Li Dihua of Siming, possessing both boldness and elegance. Quyuan's admiration was not accidental.</p>
<h3>Deserted Island</h3>
<p>— Jiao Ben</p>
<p>For millennia, it has been utterly still and silent,</p>
<p>A deserted island, uninhabited...</p>
<p>Yet one year,</p>
<p>Green grass sprouted on the deserted island,</p>
<p>And within the green grass, a graceful girl appeared,</p>
<p>Like a tiny white cloud on that deserted island,</p>
<p>Joyful and innocent,</p>
<p>She lived her life there,</p>
<p>Without sorrow, like the green grass.</p>
<p>The sunlight brought her warmth every day,</p>
<p>The ocean waves brought her coolness every day,</p>
<p>Thus nurturing her passionate and serene character,</p>
<p>And lofty thoughts—slowly brewing and growing in her mind.</p>
<p>Yet one day,</p>
<p>A hurricane blew from across the sea,</p>
<p>Blowing in an old man—her father.</p>
<p>In one night, he recounted to her</p>
<p>The story of how he had left her on this deserted island.</p>
<p>With a sorrowful tone,</p>
<p>He spoke of how the past few years had gone by.</p>
<p>Like a stream in the dead of winter,</p>
<p>He babbled on about his life—he wept.</p>
<p>His daughter wept even more sorrowfully,</p>
<p>At this moment, the sky was very dark...</p>
<p>Then another hurricane,</p>
<p>Blew in a wealthy man,</p>
<p>Wearing a fur hat on his head,</p>
<p>Dressed in fur clothing,</p>
<p>And holding a leather whip in his hand,</p>
<p>The leather whip inlaid with a piece of shiny gold—</p>
<p>He gave the old man a knowing look,</p>
<p>And the old man handed the girl over to him,</p>
<p>As if exchanging an object.</p>
<p>The deserted island trembled in panic,</p>
<p>The sea churned madly...</p>
<h3>The Unemployed</h3>
<p>— By Herbert Shaw, Translated by Yu Zhongxin</p>
<p>Three months of unemployment had made him crude and reckless; his cheeks were so gaunt as to be unbelievable, and everywhere he exuded an aura of weariness and exhaustion. He had barely touched a crumb of bread for nearly two days, and the food from those two days ago seemed to dazzle before his eyes, oh! How he missed food!</p>
<p>His right hand was thrust into his pocket, gripping his only possessions—two pennies—tightly, as if fearing he would lose them. Although he had racked his brains and exhausted his thoughts trying to shake off the thought, hunger would not forgive him, which made it somewhat unbearable, and he would occasionally utter a few complaints. As for his gaze, it often shot towards the shop windows, staring blankly at the various bright and alluring colors, which seemed to give him some solace!</p>
<p>The biting cold wind stabbed into his heart like a sharp blade, causing him to tremble involuntarily. Suddenly, sparks of anger burst forth in his heart, spreading through his veins. A secret desire directed him to cross the road and hide in front of a house, quietly watching his only hated enemy—the shop owner—loitering at the bus stop. As for his various sufferings—hunger, cold, unemployment, etc.—were they not all inflicted by this enemy, everything created by a cunning merchant?</p>
<p>Three years ago, the air of cannon fire filled the world, and the tide of recession flooded in all directions. His shop tottered precariously in this storm, and only through his efforts and struggle did he manage to weather the danger. However, his shop was already dilapidated; before long, unfortunately, misfortune descended upon him once more. It turned out that the cunning merchant, relying on his nimble skills, colluded with officials, using despicable means to forcibly buy up his shop, leaving him wandering the streets, setting up a small stall alone to make a living. But now, he no longer had the capital to continue setting up his stall…</p>
<p>In the crowd, he followed the merchant onto the bus, took out his last two pennies, and exchanged them for a ticket. He then casually chose a seat near the merchant, his eyes fixed on the merchant's leather bag, knowing that the bag was stuffed with money.</p>
<p>Before the bus reached its destination, he had already planned his scheme:—</p>
<p>He knew that after the merchant got off the bus, he would have to walk along a pebble path leading to his office. It was a secluded place, rarely patrolled by the police, and that would indeed be a good opportunity to strike—he planned to rob the bag. As for the miser's life, he could be spared.</p>
<p>—A series of smug smiles appeared on his face. He did not feel the baseness or cruelty of this means, only that it was the punishment the cunning one deserved.</p>
<p>A jumble of voices interrupted his thoughts:</p>
<p>"Nonsense, I clearly gave you a shilling, and the military notes and change are all in my wallet!" a fashionable woman said angrily to the ticket seller.</p>
<p>"Madam, you must be mistaken!" the ticket seller said coldly. "If you've already bought a ticket, then where is it?"</p>
<p>She rummaged through her wallet for a while, but still couldn't find the ticket, and had to admit her mistake, pay the fare again, and get off the bus.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he noticed a tiny gleam flickering beside his foot. He glanced at it greedily, then bent down. By the time he straightened his body again, he had a shilling clutched tightly in his palm. He looked around and let out a triumphant laugh, then looked out the window again, and a prominent advertisement reflected in his eyes, and he laughed happily as if everything was alright. The thoughts of robbery and revenge he had held only seconds ago had already been assimilated by joy.</p>
<p>The bus gradually slowed down, slowed down… until it stopped. He looked at the huge advertisement for the hotel across the street, stood up, and hurriedly ran off the bus, stepping onto the sidewalk.</p>
<p>A thick and enticing fragrance mingled in the noisy atmosphere, and he tremblingly pushed open the hotel door. Ah! How he missed food!</p>

<h3>Ice by the Yalu River, Third of Random Recollections from a Paper Window</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>The Yalu River can be said to be a river that divides China and Korea. Indeed, the water of the Yalu River is as green as the feathers on a duck's head. But in winter, this river is completely frozen. Andong is the hub of land and water transportation where it borders Korea. From the name Andong, one can imagine the glory of the ancient Tang dynasty conquering Goguryeo. Across the river from Andong is Sinuiju in Korea. The Japanese once built a railway bridge across this river. Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans walked across this bridge, differentiating themselves. Western suits, kimonos, gowns, and white jackets were the distinguishing features of the people of these countries here. From June onwards, the Yalu River is covered in snow. The river mouth is blocked by ice, and the ice on the river surface is very thick. Snow is added to the ice, and the snow freezes into ice. The ice blocks on the riverbank are jagged, and it is easy for people walking on the road to slip and fall. However, the people there often cross the river on the ice. Not only can people walk on the ice, but also large carts pulled by animals can pass over the ice, and even cars drive over it. It's a beautiful sight. On the snow-white ice surface, black figures come and go densely, like sesame seeds sprinkled on white flour. But the most beautiful sight is the Koreans. In winter, they also wear white outer garments, and their hair is wrapped in white cloth, each one resembling a filial son in mourning. Most of them carry things on their heads, walking on the ice. Even more beautiful are the Korean girls. They wear crimson tops, white skirts, short belts, and their hair is tied in a bun, giving them a special charm. If it is said that Korea is descended from Jizi, and their clothing has not undergone any changes, then this greatly is the demeanor of ancient women.</p>
<p>Watching the hurried pace of pedestrians coming and going in this snowy landscape evokes special feelings. But one must never assume that their habit of treading on ice is without danger. Often, ice blocks suddenly crack open, and people fall into the water. Sometimes you can see people climbing up from the ice, but sometimes, people disappear after going down.</p>
<p>Walking across the iron bridge from Andong is Sinuiju in Korea, and that is the local customs of Korea. Row upon row of not very tall houses with surrounding corridors are in the gaps of rows of evergreen trees. The construction of the houses is in the style of small pavilions, without the barrier of outside walls. At night, people sleep in such houses, and they can spend the night simply by closing the door. I really wonder if Korea is still a country where doors are not closed at night and no one picks up lost items?</p>
<p>Listen, clear and pleasing, round and like pearls, and the women are especially beautiful, slim and graceful, somewhat resembling Suzhou. On the Songhua River, there are dugout canoes. These are entire tree trunks, hollowed out to be used as a means of crossing the water. Therefore, the boat is especially long. Those who sit in the boat should be two in a row, two in a row, sitting inside in a double-row column, which is very orderly. At night, the dugout canoes are all docked on the riverbank. With a few friends, buy some wine and dishes, sit in the belly of this dugout canoe, as if riding a big fish, watching the moon rise from behind the South Mountain, gradually rising to the middle of the sky, shining on the river water, like a piece of blue glass, "moonlight reflects water, water reflects sky," in this situation, sing loudly the line "The general fixed Tianshan with three arrows, the brave man sang a long song to enter the Han pass," and then have a Jilin girlfriend, hey! You will feel that the three northeastern provinces are extremely beautiful!</p>
<h3>The Falling of Dongting, Fourth of Random Recollections from a Paper Window</h3>
<p>— Previous Person</p>
<p>What is strange is that many Hunan friends do not talk much about the beauty of Dongting, but I, to this day, cannot forget Dongting Lake. It was more than twenty years ago, sitting on a steamboat, sailing to the northern mouth of Dongting Lake and dropping anchor. It was evening, and the sun hung in the western sky, more than ten feet above the lake surface, shining on the city walls of Yuezhou Mountain, like the face of a drunken old man. Commonly known as "eight hundred miles of Dongting," the water surface of Dongting Lake is indeed very wide. On the side opposite Yuezhou, there is no visible boundary, it is a line where the sky and water meet. The water is as yellow and turbid as the Yangtze River, and it has dangerous waves. Facing this lake, it is like floating on the sea. The setting sun shines on the lake surface, with ten thousand rays of golden light, sparkling and undulating, it is really magnificent. In the distance, you can see the southern mouth of the lake, with many green mountains floating on the water surface. Going in from there is the Xiang River, Changsha, Hengshan, which contain many famous cities and historical sites, and when the sunset over Dongting Lake gradually falls from the water, in the distance, standing tall in the heart of the lake, like a crouching lion, is Junshan Mountain, which gradually disappears into the darkness of dusk. It seems that there are many secrets hidden in that mountain, and a few fishing lights flicker on the lake surface.</p>
<p>Once, I took a boat from the side of Yueyang Tower to Junshan. The boatman rowed for almost a day, and as we approached Junshan, it was again the time when the setting sun was low on the lake surface. Climbing up from the slippery and messy rocks, it was another world inside. Junshan Academy, built on the mountainside, had long been dilapidated. Turning past the dilapidated Dragon King Temple, I found the tomb of the concubine of the Xiaoxiang River, and nearby were clumps of spotted bamboo. It is said that the bamboo has spots because the concubine once shed tears on it, and from this one can imagine the concubine's heartbreak, and why the bamboo is precious. Although this is just an old legend, I often imagine it to be true, and everything inside Junshan seems to be more meaningful. Here you can see rice fields, fishing boats, villages, reeds, and forests, as well as oxen and fishing nets, but not many people live here, and they live an exceptionally simple life. When hungry, you can't find a restaurant. You negotiate with the fishermen, give them some money, and ask them to cook some noodles, but it is just heating up the dried black noodles and adding a handful of salt. They actually have fish, but they want to keep it to sell in Yuezhou, and they will never take it out to entertain guests from afar. The surroundings of Junshan are endless reeds, being washed by the water and blown by the wind, swaying and swaying, showing the dangerous terrain here. In autumn, the boundless reed catkins sway in the autumn wind. Here it is solitary and desolate.</p>
<p>On Junshan Mountain, by the side of Dongting Lake, one often thinks of the stories of Qu Yuan, the ancient Shun, Ehuang, and Nüying, which can evoke more fantasies than thinking of these stories elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Fragments</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>Fireflies</p>
<p>Flickering fireflies with a faint blue luster, how many sentimental poets have written for you how many magnificent poems containing a rich melancholy.</p>
<p>Those who trek in the dark, groping on the dark road, the boundless dark current of night, flooding the mountains and fields, a blur. The road is gone, the road is swallowed by darkness. The trekkers cannot find the road they should be heading, they anxiously await a spark of light. But in this desolate and empty wilderness, where to find light!</p>
<p>So they think of fireflies, and they rely on that spark of faint light from the fireflies to complete a long, rugged and steep night road.</p>
<p>Waves</p>
<p>The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl thinking of her lover who is fighting the storm at sea.</p>
<p>The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl grieving for the bleakness of life at sea.</p>
<p>The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl witnessing her only boat being robbed by savage pirates and having no way to make a living.</p>
<p>Those surging and tumbling waves! Do you know how many miserable lives of the children of the sea, crawling under the whip of life, watching the sea all day long, have you once engulfed? They were born at sea, grew up at sea, gave their precious youth and those pearl-like golden days to the sea, lived with the sea, and breathed with the sea.</p>
<p>But their lives are sad.</p>
<p>Their lives, as sad as their lives, are destroyed in the overturning of the ruthless waves.</p>
<p>Sail</p>
<p>Living on a southern island gave me many beautiful memories; those sails floating on the sea, people accustomed to sea life, hoist a wandering sail and fight against the monstrous waves, they used their blood to write down many heroic battles and tragic sacrifices of those heroic and moving poems. People who grow up on the seashore, each of them admires the sails on the sea and the bright shining lighthouse. Often when they see the lighthouse shining on the dark sea, they will think of the story of the sail that lost its way on a clear night and was almost swallowed by the sea, and many people thank the lighthouse at sea. Therefore, the lighthouse is missed by sailors.</p>
<p>Seagulls</p>
<p>I miss those sails that fight the waves. But I miss even more the seagulls that fly around the sails, flapping their wings and splashing the waves. They soar on the sea all year round and sing on the sea, and they are brave in battle.</p>
<p>The storm is coming, and they still fly peacefully on the sea, a pair of strong wings stir up countless white foam waves, dancing a mysterious seabed dance, and I am lost.</p>
<p>From then on, I missed the seagulls.</p>
<p>Now it's been eight years, I haven't seen the sea, I don't know if the seagulls are still singing around the sails?</p>

<h3>Speaking of Pure White Snow in the Bitter Cold</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Goose Feather Snow Accompanies the God of Wealth</p>
<p>On the day of the legendary "God of Wealth Descending," goose feather-like snow fell incessantly. Is it pouring a bucket of cold water on the hopeful people? Or is "Heaven" scattering a shower of six-petaled flowers to bid farewell to the "God of Wealth"?</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the feelings that accompany wind and snow. The serenity, the low-hanging clouds that produce wind and snow make people melancholy; but as soon as snowflakes flutter and descend, excitement replaces melancholy. In our nerves, brain cells, and bodies, we react to this sudden change.</p>
<p>The shapes of snowflakes are so endlessly varied that it can be said that no one has ever seen two completely identical ones. In one snowstorm, an American scientist once estimated that one acre of land was covered with ten quadrillion snowflakes. Each one is a tiny crystalline flower. Some are so small that they are only one-hundredth of an inch long; even the largest ones do not exceed half an inch in diameter.</p>
<p>The countless snowflakes in a cluster of snow reflect nature's bottomless creative power. It is individual. But each snowflake is shaped by its past experiences. An expert peering through a microscope can discover the beginnings of a snowflake and the signs of its subsequent variations and strange events. Although many things about snowflakes and life remain a mystery, it is much clearer than the period when the Greeks called snowflakes "woolly water."</p>
<p>Every lead-colored winter cloud is a huge warehouse storing crystalline products, and behind it the work of making snowflakes is in progress. A snowflake is usually a tiny, frozen fragment of a winter cloud. The raw materials are the invisible steam and moisture in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>How is the Pure White Cotton Formed?</p>
<p>In the past, the basic rule of snowflake structure was that they were hexagonal, like the cells of a honeycomb. Former scholars believed that this rule had no exceptions. Now, we know that variations such as triangular snowflakes also occur frequently. But among the hundred thousand types of snowflakes recorded in films and pictures, they are indeed all miniature six-petaled flowers, and each corner is almost invariably sixty degrees.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, pure white snow is not truly white. At least, it is not white when it crystallizes in the air. Most of it is transparent, like glass. But when it falls to the ground in heaps, the crystals reflect light in all directions, creating a perception of pure white.</p>
<p>Many scholars and scientists are equally dedicated to studying the private lives of snowflakes, one of whom is Vincent Schaefer, a scientist at the General Electric Research Laboratory in New York State. In recent years, he has invented a method of preserving the delicate form of snowflakes, which is simple: let the snowflakes fall into a transparent plastic liquid that can quickly harden, turning the snowflakes that fall into it into fossils that do not change shape. These "fossilized snowflakes" can be filed into glass slides one by one for observation under a microscope or photography in one's spare time. They are permanently preserved, unaffected by changes in time or climate.</p>
<p>To collect snowflakes for his students, Schaefer once went to the summit of Mount Washington. On one occasion, he collected snow crystals in an Army bomber flying 200 miles per hour through a snowstorm 10,000 feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Snowflakes Symbolize Fleeting Moments</p>
<p>In art, the shape of snowflakes represents the briefest and most ephemeral quality, it is the ultimate representation of beautiful fragility. In all the snow-covered areas, among the countless crystalline armies of poetry falling from the winter clouds, only a relatively few thousand forms are preserved by pen or camera. The rest are lost forever, even unknown in human memory.</p>
<p>But in nature, this beautiful fragility does not cause sighs. Nature does not erect monuments. The snowflakes that fall and disappear in heaps from the lead-colored weather do not ask for or deserve our pity. You assume it is what it is. Aren't the feelings towards snowflakes completely different for those who appreciate the snow around the stove and those who shiver in single clothes?</p>
<h3>Tail</h3>
<p>— Shu Shang</p>
<p>A large group of Soviet rats fled back from China. The Soviet hen asked them:</p>
<p>"Why did you flee back?"</p>
<p>The group of rats replied: "The Chinese like our tails very much, and we were almost all had our tails cut off!"</p>
<h3>The Sound of New Year Drums Echoes in the Tail, the Tight Drumbeats Shake the Ground</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>At the end of the year in China, the sound of New Year drums, "peng peng peng!" East also "peng peng peng"! West is also "peng peng peng" beating, it really feels very lively, full of "atmosphere of prosperity".</p>
<p>But the New Year has passed for several days, and the sound of the New Year drums is about to become an "echo in the tail"!</p>
<p>What replaces it is the "war drum" of the battlefield, which is being beaten so "tightly"! The tone of this kind of war drum is "Fight! Fight! Fight!" "Light! Light! Light!" "Fight until it's light! Fight until it's light! Fight! Fight! Light!"</p>
<p>The tones beaten out by the New Year drums and the war drums are obviously very different. One is "singing and dancing in prosperity," while the other is "the chaos of war"!</p>
<p>Of course, we like to listen to "the New Year drums of singing and dancing in prosperity," and we hate "the war drums of the chaos of war!"</p>
<h3>Beware of the "Pai Gow Scammer"</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, Shanghainese people, in addition to watching plays and dancing, whether in shops or homes, are all happily playing mahjong and pai gow. Fortunately, the shop assistants, workers, nannies, and others have their pockets filled with year-end bonuses and are enjoying themselves in time, and they don't care about winning or losing a few dollars. Therefore, the pai gow scammer seizes this opportunity to find a way to join the battle formation and make some extra money from you.</p>
<p>The other day, the newspaper reported that at the Tianhe Dyeing Shop on Zhenjiang Road, various employees were gambling on pai gow in the shop. A person named Wu Xuequn, accompanied by two unknown persons, went to participate. After about half an hour, a person named Sun Xindong had already lost more than 300,000 yuan in cash on the spot. One of the gamblers, named Fu Zhiliang, suddenly said that the people who came were suspicious and were probably pai gow scammers. Wu Xuequn and others were exposed and ran out the door, etc. Judging from this news, this kind of pai gow scammer must be a person of inferior ability, so he was exposed. Highly skilled pai gow scammers are only willing to show their skills on tables with hundreds and thousands of dollars, and they rely on these few days from New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival for their livelihood throughout the year.</p>
<p>What is a pai gow scammer? They have a pair of sharp, limited eyes and ten nimble fingers. A deck of thirty-two dragon tiles, most of which are made with bamboo backs, and on the bamboo backs are faint lines and bamboo veins. The bamboo veins of each tile are different. In the eyes of a pai gow scammer, as long as he flips through them two or three times, he can recognize each one, no different from a penetrating X-ray. His fingers also have great power. He is confident that he can flip two dice to make them turn over and determine how many points. Gamblers with this kind of exquisite skill are truly invincible. I advise those who are addicted to gambling to be careful and vigilant, and not to be scammed by the pai gow scammer again.</p>
<h3>The Story of Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— Chunliang</p>
<p>Hitting a Wall</p>
<p>One of the most endearing stories about Roosevelt is about a visitor to the White House who criticized Roosevelt, saying, "Mr. President, how were you able to attain such excellent patience in this world—you encounter so many troubles and disputes every day?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt answered sharply, "If you spend two years learning how to hit a wall, hitting it until your toes are swollen and aching, then you will gain patience."</p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>On the last day of the Yalta Conference, there was a break for everyone to socialize. Douglas, Cornell, came to chat with Roosevelt and asked, "Mr. President, how old are you now?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt replied, "According to the calendar, I am sixty-two years old, but when it comes to doing work, I am thirty-five years old."</p>
<p>Everyone is Right</p>
<p>A story tells of two disputing people who received the same answer when reporting to the President. At one point, a senator presented his reasons to Roosevelt, and Roosevelt said to him, "Yes, you are right!"</p>
<p>Later, another senator came and presented the reasons for the opposite argument, and Roosevelt said to him, "Yes, you are right!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, who had been standing nearby, later said, "But you can't possibly agree with two completely opposite reasons!"</p>
<p>President Roosevelt reportedly replied to her like this: "Yes, you are right!"</p>
<h3>Not a Joke</h3>
<p>— Shuxiang</p>
<p>When a thief was about to be executed, the policeman, holding a gun, said to him, "I have no choice but to make a living killing people, so don't resent me after you die." The thief said, "I am also dying to make a living, why would I resent you?"</p>
<p>After the Subei region was purged, the people returned to their hometowns. A child saw a portrait of ××× on the wall and asked his father, "Who is this person?" "This is ×××." "What did this person do?" "This person was liberating us, liberating our chains." "What are chains?" the son asked strangely again. "Chains are your mother's gold chain and my silver watch chain."</p>
<p>A new recruit on the front line had his hand blown off by a shell and shouted, "How could this happen, my life is over!" A comrade beside him said, "That's a small matter, look at Wang Desheng, his head was blown off and he didn't make a sound."</p>
<p>In the pavilion in front of Feilai Peak at Lingyin Temple in West Lake, there is a couplet that reads: "When did the spring become cold, from where did the peak fly?" Someone added a line below: "Instruct the Hangzhou Municipal Government to investigate and report."</p>
<h3>"Air-Belt"</h3>
<p>— Yuqiang</p>
<p>Waterproof · Heatproof · Coldproof · The Contribution of War</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, there has been a new secret weapon that newspapers have never mentioned a single word about, and even six months after Japan's surrender, only a few scientists know about it.</p>
<p>This mysterious thing is neither radar nor an atomic engine. It is a piece of fabric! A new type of fabric with strange and exciting properties, called "Air-Belt."</p>
<p>A coat made of Air-Belt can prevent cold, heat, and water.</p>
<p>Liquid "Air-Belt glue" can be sprayed onto the interior surfaces of your car (including the glass), making it suitable for the hottest summer climates or the bitterest winter cold. There is no danger of suffocation because Air-Belt can "breathe," in other words, it allows air to enter and exit its surface.</p>
<p>The Best Material for Sportswear</p>
<p>The Air-Belt industry is already solving the clothing problems of athletes everywhere. If you wear tropical material plus Air-Belt apparel while hunting in the tropics, you won't get too hot. Conversely, if you wear a fitted Air-Belt sweater in cold regions, it will protect you from the cold and frost.</p>
<p>Trout fishermen know that rubber boots are not entirely satisfactory. Adding Air-Belt can create a pair of warm, waterproof boots that will keep your feet sweating even if you are standing in water two feet deep.</p>
<p>If, while boating, you accidentally fall into the water, and the water depth exceeds your height, you don't need to swim frantically. Air-Belt material has complete buoyancy and can save your life.</p>
<p>In addition to the above advantages, Rebeck said in "Motor News": "Air-Belt can be sewn into any thickness, style, or color of clothing. The possibilities for this new material to protect humans against climate and humidity are limitless."</p>
<p>Two professors at the University of Michigan, Dr. Newburgh and Dr. Bartell, are the great contributors to the creation of this new magical fabric. When Newburgh was a researcher at the "National Institute" during the war, he saw an urgent need for simple clothing that could protect our pilots at changing altitudes or when forced to land in water.</p>
<p>No known material was satisfactory. Wool has excellent warmth retention, but it cannot resist moisture. Rubber is waterproof, but very scarce and has very little cold-proofing effect.</p>
<p>Newburgh and Bartell worked long hours in laboratories labeled "secret," with the assistance of military and civilian researchers, and finally invented Air-Belt in September 1944.</p>
<p>Unfulfilled Ambitions, the War Ends</p>
<p>A transport plane took off hastily, carrying the first batch of cargo to Okinawa. There, the soldiers enthusiastically received this defensive, strange new material. However, before Air-Belt could be delivered to all the battle lines, the war ended.</p>
<p>Today, high-powered machinery is mass-producing Air-Belt, supplying it to the armed forces in peacetime America, as well as unexpectedly meeting civilian needs.</p>
<p>According to experts, this new fabric will be used as a lining for two commonly used materials (such as cotton, rayon, or silk), so that a garment can resist the attacks of climate and humidity.</p>
<p>The details of manufacturing Air-Belt are still a secret. However, we already know that the basic raw material is a common chemical called "silicon latex." At the same time, it has also been revealed that at a certain stage in the manufacture of Air-Belt, it is combined with a down-like substance to make a surprisingly good filling for life belts, because its buoyancy is greater than that of cork or kapok (the floss from the seeds of the kapok tree).</p>
<p>"If this material had been ready before the Allied invasion of Europe," Baker said, "eight thousand soldiers would not have ended up in the hospital; leather combined with Air-Belt could have protected feet on the battlefield."</p>
<p>Civilians have already inherited the enjoyment of this secret weapon made for the armed forces. This will grant humanity greater health and happiness. (Translated from the February issue of Reader's Digest)</p>

<h3>Clever Answer</h3>
<p>— Baozhe</p>
<p>Father: "You are a high school student now, let me ask you a question: Why does the distance between the train tracks appear narrower the further away you look at them?"</p>
<p>Son: "That's because the train gradually gets smaller when it gets there."</p>
<h3>Ode to Gold Bars (Yu Meiren)</h3>
<p>— Sui</p>
<p>True gold bars are not afraid of fire,</p>
<p>Gold is refined from fire.</p>
<p>The moon is dark and the wind is high, red everywhere,</p>
<p>Water without gold is useless!</p>
<p>The five elements restrain and generate each other,</p>
<p>Transactions depend on public success.</p>
<p>What is more important than protecting your family and saving your life?</p>
<p>Stock up on gold bars so you don't cry to heaven in a crisis!</p>
