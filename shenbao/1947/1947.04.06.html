<p>〔中央社徐州五日電〕魯南國軍四日已將臨棗支綫與費縣間之零星共軍掃蕩盡净，並會同津浦正面與由濟南下國軍加强沂蒙山區西北南三面之封鎖。</p>
<p>〔又電〕困據沂蒙山區之共軍，現改稱華東野戰軍，原有新編解放各師，統編爲十個縱隊，每縱隊轄三個師，衆信共軍此舉係作化整爲零之準備，期於國軍搜山時，謀個別之逃竄。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州五日電〕共軍劉伯誠糾集七萬之衆，向豫北平漢綫及道淸路傾巢猛犯，岡作最後掙扎，迄四日止已慘遭敗北，幾全軍覆沒，殘餘共軍狼狽回竄，潰不成軍，沿途三五成羣，紛紛向國軍投誠，被俘及投誠共軍官兵，均險腫眼赤，足破跛行，鬼形　面，緣此次作戰之共軍，多係劉伯誠在魯西新裹脅之壯丁，晝夜奔走，每日僅食小米稀粥兩餐，今竟強迫驅至豫北前綫填塞火海，實慘無人道已極。如楊勇三十日至三日曾率共軍　萬餘猛攻黃河鐵橋四畫夜，結果共軍僅有一人攻至鐵絲網，後被擊斃，其餘均於未至鐵絲網前已喪命，國軍火力之強烈，可以想見。</p>

<p>〔中央社西安五日電〕陝北急賑大隊祝兼大隊長紹周，爲謀解決延安難民衣着問題，特飭由急振款內撥支一億元購買白洋布七百疋，刻正包裝中，俟運輸工具商妥，即行北運。按此批布疋足資延安難民每人縫製服裝一套之用。</p>

<p>〔合眾社北平五日電〕據美海軍官方宣布，五日淸晨，美海軍陸戰隊在塘沽附近抗禦人數不詳之「暴徒」襲擊，「暴徒」在夜半後潛入該地區，攻擊美軍軍火倉庫之衛兵，進襲者之目的，顯爲希望刦奪手溜彈與他種軍火，海軍陸戰隊總部所發第一次消息，並未透露進襲究吾刦奪軍火而去，稍後之消息稱：陸戰隊向北追擊來襲者。按塘沽位於直隸灣，距天津紙數英里，爲美軍所利用之華北主要海口，自美陸戰隊於一九四五年十月在華北登陸後，渠等即利用之作爲接濟與補充人員之海口，並在該處成立接濟美軍之軍火倉庫，在此軍火庫之四週，美陸戰隊衛兵常與不知屬於何方之軍隊不斷發生衝突，但大部分之不幸事件，據信，皆爲企圖竊盜而已。去年十月三·四兩日，在塘沽區內，曾有敵對勢力一隊，攻擊美海軍陸戰隊第一師之軍火接濟倉庫，該次有一海軍陸戰隊受微傷，一華人被擊死，另一華人受傷，該受傷之華人被俘，告調查之美方官員稱：該决攻擊目的，在獲得軍火，以供駐紮於塘活鄰近共軍某旅之用。今日之攻擊，使美睦戰隊死傷率較去年七月之「安平事件」爲高，在該次事件中，共軍暗襲一輛自天津運輸接濟品至北平軍調部之戴貨卡車，死美兵四人，傷十一人。遭受攻擊塘沽附近之軍火庫，位於共黨活動區之邊緣，最近消息，曾述及共黨自東徂西成一剪刀形軍事行動，目的顯然在切斷國軍所控制天津至唐山長達百哩之鐵路綫，在該區之戰事日趨激烈中，美軍之軍火倉庫，對於交戰雙方，皆爲有價值之鹵獲品。據消息靈通方面稱：共軍第五十九旅，最近在塘活區附近極爲活躍，去年美軍有一陸戰隊被架，亦爲該部所爲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津五日電〕國軍第二軍六百名，五日開往塘沽援助美軍對付共軍，據稱：共軍五日晨襲擊塘沽附近美軍軍火庫，死傷的一百人，激戰時，此間曾有小型戰車兩輛駛往增援，沿途地雷爆炸，致未能開到戰區，國軍開到時，共軍已退去。據議于軍當局稱：遺屍身上搜獲文件，證明係屬共軍，襲擊目的顯在搶刧軍火，如有被刧去，恐亦不多。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕塘沽附近五哩處美軍軍火庫，五晨一時十五分被暴徒襲擊，駐守該處之美兵，與之激戰四小時又一刻鐘，美兵除死傷外，並有戰車一輛被地雷炸毀。激戰時，庫內軍火爆炸數决，美軍戰鬥機開到時，暴徒已退走，故未參加作戰。受傷美兵已由飛機送往天津救治，其中六名恐無生望。六個月來該處美軍軍火庫被共軍襲擊，今爲第二次。第一次襲擊係發生於去年十月十日，其時共軍約二百名，刧去軍火若干，並傷美兵一名，共軍遺下屍體若干具，目下平，津，靑島三處，仍駐有美軍八千至一萬名，據美軍當局五日宣布：美軍撤退計劃不致變更。</p>
<p>〔合眾長社華盛頓五日電〕華盛頓海軍總部五日稱：該部迄未直接正式接獲塘沽美軍火庫遭暴徒襲擊，美兵死五人，傷十六人之報告，迄未接獲之原因，係電訊遲慢之故。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約五日電〕據此間所得廣播消息，塘沽附近美軍需庫遭襲擊，美海軍陸戰隊人員死五人，惟消息傳來太晚，五日晨報第一次版未及刋嚴。</p>

<h3>政府改組日內實現　府委人選各方均已確定　主席返京後名單即公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕民社黨張君勱，定六日晨自滬抵京，以民社黨參加府委名單提交政府，青年黨之府委名單，五日在滬決定，亦可望於六日提交政府。五日曾琦有電致京，左舜生告以正在決定中。左氏告記者，本晚可作最後決定。據悉：青年黨國府委員四人，已經決定為曾琦，余家菊，何魯之，陳啟天。又社會賢達之國府委員人選，由主席提出，據確息，其名單為莫德惠，陳輝德（光甫），王　五，胡適（惟胡以北大校務紛繁為說，不願就斯職，主席堅邀出任，並請兼長北大，如胡堅辭不就，將為部從恩）。綜上以觀，政府之改組，僅待主席返京予以公佈，即可完成矣。</p>
<p>〔又電〕雷　晤記者：民青兩黨參加國府委會暨行政院，已無問題，惟尚待主席返京後作最後一次之高談，始可公佈，大致國府委會公佈在前，政院公佈在後。雷氏又稱：關於各黨參加地方政權問題，政府在原則上乃極表歡迎。</p>

<h3>孫院長在滬談話　政府改組確為實行多黨訓政　然後再達到民主憲政之階段</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕立法院孫院長，昨在青年團園遊會中，為各報記者包圍，詢以政府改組，及職業團體要求增加國大代表與立法委員名額等各項問題。孫氏對政府改組事不願發表意見，笑謂：此須問民社青年兩黨及政府負責商談人士。某記者告以今日青年黨機關報中華時報社評，對孫氏所稱：「改組政府乃由一黨訓政改為多黨訓政」一點，表示此是國民黨人的看法，青年黨人不能茍同。孫氏乃重複闡述稱：「黨政政府，必須由人民直接選舉，此次各黨派參加政府之人物，皆係由各黨內產生，既未經民選程序，當然不能稱其為憲政，且在本年十二月廿五日憲法正式實施以前，訓政時期約法，仍屬有效，蓋國家決不能一時無法也。故今日之改組政府，確為自一然訓政，改為多黨訓政，然後再達到民主憲政之階段」。關於職業團體要求增加國大代表及立法委員名額問題，孫氏認為：國大代表選舉罷免法暨立法委員選舉罷免法，業經立法院正式通過頒布，殊難變更。記者又問：全國各職業團體，已聯合向政府當局請願，要求對國大代表及立法委員之職業團體名額，重行複議，至少須增加至百分之卅六，院長對此之意見如何？孫氏答謂：「余無意見，但此增加名額問題，須待改組後之新政府決定矣」云云。</p>

<h3>王懋功出巡江南　今視察奉賢後返鎮江　據談各縣治安已無虞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江蘇省主席王懋功氏，連日出巡江南各縣，現定今日視察奉賢後，即搭夜車返鎮江。行前語記者；江南各縣境內已無匪踪，治安已告無虞。惟地方財政，仍感困難。今年之中心工作，為肅清蘇北殘匪8現蘇北有十五縣已完全肅清，尚有十餘縣則猶待清勦。殘匪之盤據於蘇北者，約在三萬人以上，進勦部隊以國軍為主力，輔以地方自衛力量，分區肅清。蘇北在過去，民間武力甚為雄厚，一縣有擁有民槍五六萬枝以上者。惟自經共軍佔領後，民間藏槍盡被搜括，現省符積極培植民間自衛力量，各縣民間藏槍，多者三四千枝，少者亦有千餘枝，民間自衛隊已有三萬餘人。蘇北治安之恢復，關係江南者甚大，蓋如蘇北殘匪之力量不肅清，則長江千里，防不勝防，江南將無寗日。希望在今年青紗帳起之前，蘇北之秩序能全部恢復。王氏並稱：蘇北農佃糾紛，雖不能免，但並不如外傳之甚。蘇北地瘠，擁田數十畝，尚不能解決一家之生活，故中共之分田政策，證明為一失敗。且其分田之目的在征收軍糧，最高有一畝征收至八斗者，故重征之下，民不聊生。至於蘇北收復後難民之遣送，沿途由省政府與行總蘇寗分署免費輸送並供膳宿，抵達目的地後再由中央統一救濟，一切尚稱順利。目前尚滯留外埠者，頗多為鄉里仍由殘匪盤據，而不願返籍者。</p>

<h3>蘇州團管區役政　壯丁調查將竣免緩役審查開始　安家費每名每月至少十五萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州五日電〕蘇州團管區司令部於五日邀集蘇滬新聞界，舉行最近工作概况座談會，司令社緒就兵役步驟閘述甚詳，茲簡誌如後；實施兵役法之初步工作，為身家調查，凡年滿十九歲至四十五歲之人民，均在調查之列，現常熟吳江兩縣業已完成，蘇州則展綏至四月十五日完成。次則為免緩役審查，目前常熟吳江兩縣已開始辦理，其方法為根據申請，召開保民大會參加審衣意見，層轉核定，其申請適用範圍，除兵役法已規定者外，續經國防部迭令補充如下：（一）中中交農四行及同屬銀行性質職員，各機關公務員中之現役及齡男子，凡曾在高中以上學校畢業，取得軍訓及格證書者可緩徵，（二）醫藥人負同前條資格，或曾在抗戰時服務軍事機關一年以上，有軍醫署正式證件者緩徵，（三）護士助產士藥劑師等學校學生未畢業者緩征，（四）交警担任綏靖守備勤務者緩徵，（五）曾在教部認可之師範學校畢業，現任小教一年以上者緩召，（六）患病經證明不堪服作戰任務有緩召，（七）獨負家庭生計之獨丁，或同胞弟兄均已應召，或年未滿十八歲者緩召，（八）犯最重大刑為有期徒刑以上之刑，尚在追訴或執行中者緩召，（九）中紡公司專門技術員工緩召，綜上可見其緩役範圍實極廣泛，且兵役征召額僅佔全人口千分之一，以徵召年次計亦不過八分之一，故人民服兵役之機會堪云極少，今日社會心理之恐懼，純係意識上之錯誤，及杞人之憂而已，最近統計，蘇虞吳三縣人口共一百五十一萬二千餘名，內及齡男子為四十六萬三千餘名，惟正式徵兵額究　多少，及何種年次，尚須待身家調查全部究竣後決定。所堪告慰者，乃征屬之優待業已具體訂定辦法，將來應徵壯丁之安家費，每名每月至少可在十五萬元以上，就微召方式而言，亦力求公允祛弊，抽籤將以縣為單位或由適齡壯丁自行抽取，設茍發現雇丁代役規象，則決照兵役法處死刑或無期從刑或十年以上徒刑之無懲罰。</p>

<h3>十五年來的中國土地改革運動</h3>
<p>— 蕭錚</p>
<p>為中國地政學會年會作</p>
<p>自民國廿一年中國地政學會成立，中國士地改革運動有了新號召與新奮鬥。雖十五年來艱辛的國運，使土地改革運動無輝煌的發展和成績，但總算已畫了應盡的努力：在這十五年來，中國地政學會的事業，可舉者如左：</p>
<p>（一）憲法運動五五憲法國民經濟章，關於土地事項之規定，即係全部採納中國地政學會之一再建議而訂立者。該會之建議，係根據兩次憲草研究會之結論六項，於廿一年六月及十月送達立法院訂入五五憲草，至去年十二月廿五日新憲法公佈，已將本會主張全部採用。</p>
<p>（二）修正土地法運動自土地問題討論會制定十項原則後，中國地政學會即繼續研究如何修正土地法，並促其實現。廿三年八月土地委員會正式委托該會研究中央政治委員會交下之有關土地問題提案四件，即為修正土地法運動之正式開始。十月召集土地法研究會，十一月提出意見書，卒於廿五年十月有中央土地專門委員會提出之修正土地法原則二十四項。經中政會集議三次，逐條討論，於二十六年五月五日正式通過二十二項。嗣由立法院逐條提出意見，對中政會保留之地價稅採累進制一項，尤具反對之論，與本會往復辯難。直至三十五年四月二十九日國民政府公佈修正土地法，始正式規定地價稅照法定地價按累進稅率徵收之。</p>
<p>（三）地籍整理運動地盤整理不僅為實行土地政策之先河，且為增加財政收入之途徑。中國地政學會主張以科學方法作根本整理，得本會各團體會員採納。迄抗戰時各省地籍整理工作之進行，頗為迅速。該會多數會員均參加此項工作。二十六年中央擬定五年計劃時，且擬將全國測量登記分為三期完成。抗戰車興，地籍整理運動突遭非常之打擊。然國都西遷後，西南西北各省仍繼此運動之餘緒，於艱難中逐步推進其工作。現復員開始，各地會員正積極從事地籍整理之推行。</p>
<p>（四）租佃改革運動租佃制度在吾國有悠久之歷史與甚深之弊害。中國地政學會對此向有最澈底最理想之主張，初擬試行於江蘇啟東，繼擬實現於陝北，均以地方政府缺乏強固之信仰與推行之力量，未能實施。然至去年十一月，綏靖區土地處理辦法通過施行，明訂保護租佃及限制佃租為正產物三分之一暨佃農有優先獲得土地之權已證明本會主張可得農民之熱烈擁護與一般社會之好評。而規章之擬訂與步驟之釐定，均將日漸成熟。租佃制度之澈底改革與土地分配之調整，同一脈絡，本運動之展開，正方興未艾也。</p>
<p>（五）戰時墾殖與戰士授田運動在抗戰以前，中國地政學會即已注意西南西北之移墾。關於各該區荒地開墾及農地利用改良等，均已陸續加以調查與規劃。抗戰開始以後，本會首先提出戰時土地政策，進行戰時墾殖及戰士授田運動，以促國人注意。且向中央與各地政府及公私團體建議實施方案。終以時代之要來，公私墾區之成立，幾若雨後春筍。逮二十九年中央墾務總局成立，可為戰時及戰後墾殖運動行將急劇推行之明證。此外戰時田糧徵實政策開始時之戰時土地政策綱領，即係本會建議，經最高當局採納施行者。</p>
<p>（六）建立土地金融制度與土地行政制度運動土地金融制度與土地行政制度之完整，為推行土地政策之　翼。中國地政學會屢次表示設立完整系統之土地銀行與地政機關之必要，且多方為直接間接之推動，卒能逐漸完成省縣地政機關之法規與實際上之逐步設立。逮二十九年七月，中央第七次全會決議設立中國土地銀行，三十年六月，中國農民銀行暫設土地金融處，掌理其事，於是土地金融制度亦日雛形。雖距本會之理想尚逮，然本正確主張，繼續奮鬥，當能觀成於異日也。</p>
<p>（七）農地改革運動本會成立之初即以致力於農地改革為一切運動之中心。在戰前即發動實騐縣運動期於小範圍內先求本會主張之實現，以為全體之示範。故如浙之平湖，粵之連縣，陝之綏德，鄂之旅南均先後以地政實騐縣姿態出現，異或因戰事或因政局關係，卒未有成效，其比較可引為滿意者為閩之　巖與甘　之湟惠渠區與陪都之北碚區是為標準自耕農制實行之初階。三十五年八月，本會鑒於局勢之推演，已達實際採取土地改革之行動時機，乃由本會向最高當局建議以實施農地改革，為經濟改革之中心並提出實施五年經濟建設計劃綱要，當經國防國高委員會通過即將付諸實施矣。</p>
<p>（八）設立中國地政研究所及建國法商學院中國地政學會之研究工作，往時係與中央政治學校地政學院配合進行。自政校改制，地院停辦以後，該會鑑於研究之進行，不可或輟。乃決意創設地政研究所。自二十九年開始籌備，迄是年十二月正式成立。且經呈准教育部，於三十一年暑假起逐年招收研究生。三十五年春，地政研究所由渝還都，為造就建國人才起見，乃擴充設立建國法商學院，設法律，政治，經濟，合作，會計銀行等五糸。</p>
<p>（九）發行「地政月刊」及「人與地」半月刊與各種叢書叢刊本會宣傳品前此有地政月刊及地政週刊兩種，均因戰事停版。迄三十年春，發行「人與地」半月刋，負繼續宣揚土地改革之責。三十四年四月，改由地政研究所編印地政學報（季刋），以為較深研究之園地，並先後發行叢書十六種，業刋三十餘種。本會各地分會亦先後編有各種刋物，以事宣傳。</p>
<p>建國運動已實際開始，本會責任益感重大。深望海內志士共起努力，以實現平均地權建立民生主義之新經濟制度和新社會制度，是為企幸。</p>

<h3>調整委會開會達八小時　德政治問題仍僵持　奧境德資產定義亦未確定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科四日電〕調整委員會於今晨十一時卅分舉行會議，接連達八小時之久，直至晚間八時始宣告散會。四國代表團對於德國之臨時政治組織問題意見仍與以前同樣之紛歧，僅獲致一項決議，即定於明晨織續會議。四國外長原定本日午後六時開會，旋因　整委員會陷入僵同，故已展期至明日舉行。調整委員會本日昌討論之問題有三，即：（一）設立中央行政機構，以經濟部之地位行使職權，，法國代表堅持德人不得出任部長或閣員，但同意在重要行政機構與次要行政機構之間有所區別，僅後者得交付德人管理；（二）德國詻詢委員會（附屬於盟國管對委員會者）之任務與構成；（三）關於德國臨時憲法之一沒問題。此外四國外次本日亦開會討論　境德國資產問題，由蘇聯代表古塞夫主席，當即決定要求經濟委員會就此一問題提出報告。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科四日電〕外長之奧國問題代表今日繼續討論奧境德資產之定義，仍無結果，反使蘇聯與英美意見之衝突，益趨尖銳化。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科五日電〕據悉：馬歇爾爲使會議織續進行起見，將於下週提議將德國工莢心臟之魯爾區及現在波蘭手中之西里西亞農工業區，置於聯合國監督管理之下。按蘇聯前已主張將魯爾區交四强共管，波蘭則始終要求獲得西里西亞，並有蘇聯支持其要求。今馬歇爾之意乃爲整個歐洲之利益着想，故擬主張將兩地交聯合國管理，英代表勞柏特遜在調整委員會休會之前，建議四强應先決定下述各點：（一）德國人民是否有一個國籍，抑須由其所住居之州內，定其籍貫。（二）德國各州是否各自獨立，有分別樹立外交關係與簽訂條約之權。（三）中央政府是否可由人民直接選出而取得治權抑爲代表各州政府。</p>
<h3>賠償問題　無法解決</h3>
<p>〔聨合社莫斯科五日電〕今日據可靠消息，外長會議對於德國賠償問題，僵局無法打開，經濟委員會已放棄覓取折衷方案，並已停止集會討論。據蘇聯外長莫洛托夫宣稱，杜魯門總統援助希臘方案，不信其能恢復該國民主。莫氏要求不干涉希臘。德國其他問題均以賠償問題爲重心，賠償問題旣無法解決，則本屆外長會議能否有何成就，希望甚微。此後美英兩國不得已而思其次，或將設法　攏法國，使法國佔領區在經濟上與美英佔領區合併。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科四日合衆電〕西方國家今日期望莫洛托夫在德國賠償爭執上有所妥協，以配合馬歇爾於接受德國賠償可自德國目前生產量中付出之原則一點所作之協調姿態。馬氏之舉動，至少常係一旨在打破外長會議中主要僵局之策略，次一步驟當由蘇聯爲之。蘇聯方面，拒絕馬歇爾之提議，認爲不滿意，迄今在妥協方面，尚未有任何舉動。馬歇爾之提議與蘇聯所提一百億美元賠償之要來，相距頗遠。</p>
<h3>麥克奈尼闡述　德內現狀</h3>
<p>指責蘇軍事當局行動</p>
<p>〔合衆社華監頓四日電〕前駐歐美佔領軍司令麥克奈尼將軍本日聲稱：如四國外長不能獲致對德和的之協議，則德國西部或將組成另一單獨國家，包括目前英美法三國之佔領區在內。但此舉即有可能，目前尚談不到。麥氏指斥德境蘇聯當局之行動，完全根據向全世界散佈共產思想之意向。但共產主義希能滲人美軍佔領區，區內居民在最近選舉中選舉黨產共者不足百分之十。麥克奈尼又謂，德境美軍並非基於戰術之組織，不足抵抗任何强國之侵犯。而蘇聯佔領軍人數竟達四十五萬人，等於英炎法三國佔領軍之總數云。</p>
<h3>史泰遜遊蘇</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科四日電〕美國共和黨下屆總統候選人史泰遜，現以私人資格在歐洲考察，今日由莫斯科出發，至蘇聯各地旅行，數日內返此，取道列寗格勒離蘇。</p>
<h3>南副總理　發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科五日廣播：日前抵此之南斯拉夫副總理卡德爾奇，今日招待記者，抨擊奧大利，謂奧國曾兩次充作德帝國主義之工具，現仍有再蹈覆轍之可一能。南斯拉夫應曰奧國獲得一億五千萬美元之賠償，已要求一部份自奧大利生產中獲取之。</p>
<h3>蘇聨設農林部</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科五日電〕莫斯科電台宣佈：蘇聯最高議會已決定設立農林部。</p>
<h3>國際貿易機構　籌委會將開會</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕中國等十七國之代表的六七百人，將於四月十日在日內瓦舊國際聯盟之會址，舉行國際貿易機構籌備委員會之第二屆會議。</p>
<h3>防止蘇聨勢力擴張　美應負起此項責任　美議員喬治在參院宣稱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕參議院今日核准杜魯門總統听提四億元援助希臘土耳其案。參議員喬治宣稱，美國現在必須有所舉動，否則蘇聯將席捲歐洲。阻止蘇聯勢力擴展，責在吾人。如不加以阻止，則蘇聯勢力不免席捲歐洲，伸入亞洲及南美，必無止境。現有證據指示蘇聯勢力已侵入印度云。喬治續稱，蘇聯在西方控制巴爾幹各國，並在捷克與德國東部保有據點，在中國東九省及朝鮮亦切實保有勢力。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社芝加哥四日電〕國務院中東司司長韓特遜頃在此間向外交委員會宣稱，美國援助希土兩國計劃，不僅不致引起戰爭，反而能鞏固和平之基礎。希臘有民主制度，並正爲民主而奮鬥，即使忽視希臘獨立之共產黨，亦有權發行報紙。議會反對派並得批評政府，但在希臘北部則不然。至於土耳其問題，美國願與各國在聯合國機構內合作云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播，雅典保守黨報紙載開羅電稱，美國擬在希臘之萊諾斯島設立海空軍基地，但未詳細說明。萊諾斯係愛琴海中之一島，在韃靼尼爾海峽西面的五十哩。</p>
<h3>調查團應留希</h3>
<p>安理會英代表提建議</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖四日電〕英國今日草擬聲明，主張聯合國安全理事會使調查團留於巴爾幹半島，對於美國總統杜魯門之援助希臘土耳其方案則未作直接批評。據英方人士稱，英國首席代表賈德幹將在今日安理會中發言，重行聲明調查團留駐希臘北部邊境之必要，以待安理會討論其所提出之報告書，並隨時提出補充事實。</p>
<p>〔合衆社雅典五日電〕蘇聯駐希大使館官員五日稱：雖四日蘇大使館發表公報稱，蘇大使不歸國，但現蘇大使及其僚屬已決定離希返國。大使定六日返國，但將因運輸困難而展期。</p>
<h3>土議會改選　民主黨將予抵制</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安哥拉四日電〕土耳其民主黨決定不參加行將於本月六日舉行之議會局部改遷，故土國之內政局又發生新危機。民主黨與目前執掌政　之人民共和黨間之主要爭執，乃爲選舉法。民主黨認爲選舉法予政府以過份之權力，使其能控制選舉。據此間觀察家稱：民主黨之意向，乃在爭取新普選，但因政府認爲局部改選係屬合法，現行選舉法亦頗公允，故普選之權會殊爲渺茫。按民主黨自上年六月選舉以還，不斷要求修正選舉法，該黨於本年二月舉行全國會議時，曾決定該黨在議會之議員（共六十名左右）將退出議會，本月六日議會局部改選，民主黨決定予以抵制，將在事實上使土國政治恢復一黨專政矣。</p>
<h3>保議會開會　兩派議員動武</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞　保加利亞四日電討輪社會部之預算問題，反對派　員輿政府　員發生　執，竟至動式，一時會塲秩序大亂，議長乃宣布停止討黝，縱績會議時，反黝　朧頁並未出席。</p>
<h3>英遺送船遇險</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷四日電〕英國遣送船「帝國勁敵」號，昨夜一自海發港開出後，發生爆炸，詳情不明。按上星期三遣送船「精壯」號在寨浦路斯島觸水當，船底炸成一洞，聞水雷係猶太水鬼繫於船底。</p>
<h3>義經濟局勢嚴重　總理籲請美國速予援助</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬四日電〕義大利總理蓋斯貝里今日招待記者，發出警告稱，義大利非獲國外援助，不能渡過目節離關，若經濟危機加深至於無法控制，則惟有實行獨裁。當蓋氏發言時，那不勒斯之工潮已漸顯普遍。羅馬郵工因生活費高漲提出抗議，全國電訊交通亦告停滯。史奎柴諾警察與失業工人發生衝突，十一人受傷，內有警察四名。蓋氏一面發言，一面用拳擊桌，加重語氣，謂政府將採取一切方法，實行防止通貨膨脹之十四項新方案。若人民自已不能和協，則獨裁或將不免，惟爲右派或左派獨裁，蓋氏並未言明。美國國會遲不通過聯總結束後美國對美大科之援助，蓋氏表示不解，但希望美國提議援助希臘土耳其兩國不致因此减少其對義大科之援助。</p>
<h3>貝文與莫洛托夫密談　商四強公問題　莫氏含糊其詞未肯定答覆</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科四日電〕英國外相貝文昨日與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫與行秘密會議。頃悉，貝文外相曾詢問蘇聯對於四强公約之意見，莫洛托夫外長含糊其詞，未作肯定之答復。此外貝文外相昨日又與蘇聯外决維辛斯基討論與增强英蘇盟約有關之各項問題，但未獲任何進展。</p>
<p>（路透社莫斯科四日電〕官方息，修改英蘇盟約之談判，將於下週二恢復舉行。</p>
<h3>國大黨向英提出要求　印僵可望打開　英印攻守同盟在醖釀中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕此問消息靈通全預料印度問題隨時將急轉直下，包括英國與印度舉行攻守同盟之可能性在內，一俟新任印督蒙巴頓與國大黨及回盟領袖完成現階段之談話後，英國即將討論各種辦法，以打開當前僵局。聞國大黨提出下列三項要求：（一）英國立即授予印度臨時政府以自治領政府所享有之全權，不出以任何限制（二）在憲法採納以前，印度臨時政府應對制憲議會負責，制憲議會應爲臨時立法機關；（三）英國駐印度總警僅可成爲印度國家憲法上的領袖，以上之建議範圍廣大，結果所屆，回盟若不被迫參加制憲議會，惟有在臨時政府中撤退回盟各部長。衆信國大黨曾通告英政府，上項提案倘被接受，則印度願與英國談判攻守同盟條約。</p>
<h3>韓南美軍總督　主張韓人治韓　今後美軍將處監督地位</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城四日電〕朝鮮南部美軍總督勒契少將今日宣布，韓人在美軍佔領區內將擔負更大責任，以處理其自身政務。此後美國管制，僅在防止政治危機，對於不甚重要之事件，殊不欲以美國之意見或方法強加於韓人。軍政府未來政策，除去少數例外，美國人員均將退出實際工作，僅在各省各部從旁監察，藉以提出建議，糾正錯誤。軍政府之目的在建設一自由獨立及團結統一之朝鮮，由韓人主政，並自經濟，敎育有文化方面復興朝鮮。若僅欲完成第二目的，其事頗易，富有經騐之美國人可辦理朝鮮工業，藉美國專家及美國資本之援且。即可使朝鮮在短期內復興。</p>

<h3>為國定敎科書敬復鄧恭三先生（三）</h3>
<p>— 陸殿揚</p>
<p>初中六册選文作者近人居多，不下一百餘人，大公報亦有一文在內，佚名者且有多篇，可見選文時毫無成見。至鄧光生之獨排斥王光祈與常乃惪二人，亦令人不索解。王光祈對於童樂之造詣，國內外皆極著名，所作「音樂與人生」一文，與豐子愷之「美術與人生」，堪爲雙絕。常乃惪之「侵略者的失敗」，用生動之筆，記叙拿破崙侵俄之失敗，正司爲當時及今後之借鑑，似無不可選讀之處。鄧光生旣指摘部編課本內容的黨化成分，以爲擯斥別黨別派，而同時又反對選取非國民黨王光祈，常乃惪等人之文，若非別有作用，殊難合於邏輯。依照課程標準附注（一）先黨國進言諭固應選取，但全書鈑人作品一百五十餘篇中，其作者之非隸於國民黨者必多於國民黨，可以斷言。鄧光生黨化之說，可以不攻自破。選錄近人作品本極困難，稍有不愼，即近標榜，「近錄」，最不妥穩爲人，無如初中國文宜多選語體文，則近人作品勢所難免。本書取舍之間，一依課程標準中重要原則及消極條件而定，希望海內賢達批評教科書時，先詳閱課程標準，然後賜教，較爲貼切。如課程標準有欠妥之處，亦可建議修改，目前教育部正在分別邀請專家修訂課程標　，望加注教。</p>
<p>（三）鄧先生之主張爲編輯同人所不敢苟同之處有二，其一爲鄧先生之民族主義觀，爲全文中最重要之點。鄧先生主張排斥蒙古，滿淸，樹立漢人本位，是爲狹義的民族主義。在革命宣傳文字中，儘可暢所欲言，用最惡劣之字句排斥其他民族，如國父所領導之國民革命時固不妨用「驅除韃虜，恢復中華」等字句以激勵人民，推翻滿淸政治，但若在今日各民族融合爲大中華民族時，仍特此狹隘之觀念，排斥他民族，則其復果有不堪設想者。昔日之日本以及今日之列强，無時不在焗動他國內民族之分裂，以遂其侵占之慾。今環顧我國邊疆各地民放情勢，實覺不寒而慄，若再强調夷夏之防，在歷史上加意渲染元淸蹂躪漢人事蹟，引起民族間仇恨，則正中强鄰分化之計，所謂民族自決獨立運動將不旋踵而起矣。同人深深贊同本年一月十六日大公報社評「對新疆應有開明的政策」一文，覺與同人編輯初中歷史之主旨正相符合。部頒初中歷史課程標準第一條目標云：「叙述中華民族之演進，特別注意各支族間之融合與其相互依存之關係，以闡發全民族團結之歷史的根據，而於歷史上之光榮，以及近代所受列强之侵略與其原因，允宜充分說明，以激發學生復興民族之意志與決心。」部編初中歷史課本，即本此意編輯。編輯要旨中所云「以民族主義爲中心」者，指大中華民族而言，包含漢•滿·蒙·回·藏•苗等各支族，不分夷夏，不分文野，是廣義的民族主義也，其實編寫史書，固應如此。</p>

<h3>明年世運加速籌備　英籌備委員會發表聲明　首相保證政府全面支持</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕英政府最近禁止在假期以外舉行大規模運動比賽，以免吸引觀衆，妨礙生產工作，一般人因而深恐一九四八年在倫敦舉行之世界運動會，或將受阻礙。英國世運　備委員會發言人今日特發表聲明，加以闢正稱：首相艾德禮已保證支持吾人爲世運盡地主之誼，吾人現以全部速率　備，世運不致取消，延期，或改在他國舉行。首相公署發言人亦稱：政府以前保證贊助世運並無變更，經費亦無問題，供給運動塲之溫勃萊運動公司，已允許籌備委員會預支經費四十萬美元，將來在門票收入項下償還。</p>
<h3>香島球訊　滬星征港記</h3>

<p>比賽採國際賽法，五人輪戰，先勝十三局者得勝，開賽以來，雙方爭奪甚烈，由七時至十一時許，比數仍爲十一對十一，直至最後一局，東方始奮奪兩點，壓倒滬星。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况做開仍告熱鬧，尤以客帮扒吸更夥，聞近日隴海路及廣帮客人採辦甚盛，對低檔貨如元嗶幾淺色士林及細布漂布，均有相當收吸，致塲上喊價頻升。十二磅龍頭細布由十六萬六千元做高至十七萬元，較上日步昂四千元，其餘藍鷄藍鳳五福彩球ABC等細布，價俱續高，自二千元至五六千元。四君子及跳鯉嗶嘰亦上揚四千元至六七千元，其他藍布斜紋布漂布府綢等，時值銷令，價亦漲自二三千元至一萬元。紡建公司昨照例開售布疋，五福細布掛牌十五萬四千五百元，該業均肯加價四千五百元收進。市塲形勢惟高檔士林仍屬平定。</p>

<h3>統價欲漲乏力</h3>
<p>公債昨中途曾起蠢動，統丙自一二四〇〇元，開後盤高至一四三〇〇元，散買未能持久，浮多乘高出籠，復被迫低至一二五〇〇元以內結束。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊尚形微升，統丙則跌落七百元。成交有限，不到三百萬元。</p>

<h3>糖業公會緊急措置　交易以現貨為限　嚴標棧單非法買賣</h3>
<p>鈑日糖價迭見高翔，癥結所在，純係受投機者非法買賣所致。糖業公會特採取緊急措置，嚴加制止，茲錄其佈告如次：「查同業買賣向以現貨交易，近因有發現棧單交易，茲經第七十决理監緊急會議，決自即日起禁止棧單交易。同業買賣，不論何糖，一律以本棧現貨為限。各糖交易決不得超過合法利潤，如有陽奉陰違，一經查實，買賣雙方概行取消會員資格。如有經紀人居間者，該經紀人亦受除名處分，並規定本會下午停止交易」云。</p>
<p>暫行停市</p>
<p>〔又訊〕連日糖市以客需較暢，趨勢頗緊。昨公會為避免發生黑市起見，各經紀人決走停市五天，以示限制。查土糖如順德靑最高爲十五萬元，興化白廿三萬二千元，興赤十四萬八千元，海南赤十三萬入千元，刁靑十四萬一二千元。經此壓制後，糖市或可轉鬆云。</p>
<h3>明前龍井上市</h3>
<p>昨爲農曆淸明，本市各大茶舖新茶業已應市。按此批新茶係由杭州溫州平山產地，於節前採摘烘焙後，運來上海，稱爲明前龍匪。全數極　，　數不過數十斤，而由茶商携至上海，向著名茶舖分售，俗稱報信茶，索價　昂。頭批西湖龍井每斤爲十六萬元，溫州貨約减低三成，以上二茶售價則减半。據悉：今春明前因雨水不多，色香味均佳，如榖雨前後天光睛好，則高山茶市收穫更可良好。據茶業中人談：今年全國茶葉收成估計，當較去年加增五成，其原因：（一）茶農逐漸注意及此，加去冬施肥爻草等工作、已見改良。（二）茶貸放寬，茶農茶商表示極大興趣。（三）經勝利後慘淡經營，各地受摧殘之茶塲力謀恢復。</p>
<h3>金山枝回升</h3>
<p>金山元枝近因產價禮緊，劃申需四十五萬元，查前市號盤開四十二萬左右，前日開升四十四萬元，昨呌四十五萬元後市防緊。</p>
<h3>茶市云化欠旺</h3>
<p>龍井等各式內銷茶，目前雖漸屆產新之期，但執貨者對握在手一中之陳貨，售意咸不鬆弛。查買戶鑒於本街及客帮之去化，均極式徵，因此僅零星染指，昨全日經過情形，吐納依然相埒，市勢遂鮮起伏，至洋莊茶市，一般貨主仍頻頻出籠，然問津者袖手旁觀，情况迄少抬頭，行市徘徊疲途。</p>
<h3>本市製革工業　遭遇三點力學哥難　減工或停業者數見不鮮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：本市製革工業同業公會會員共有三百三十家，分爲甲乙丙丁四組。甲組製造底皮，共十四家。乙組製造面皮，共一百十三家。丙組製造箱子面皮·白菉皮·羊皮。共一百三十八家。丁組製造手套·皮夾·共六十五家。</p>
<p>甲乙兩組會員，多備有簡單之機器。其他皮作坊，多係手工業，規模不大，每月出品少則十餘張，多則數十張。工作無一定計劃，遇市面好轉或經濟充裕，則購進生皮，從事製造。如情况不好，則時作時輟。</p>
<p>本市製革廠最近產置，每月可產底皮三十萬磅，而子牛皮四萬五千尺，面子羊皮六萬尺。其中底皮之三月份總產量，已减至二十萬磅。內政府接收敵僞工廠，每月約產六萬磅。該項底皮品質，遠勝舶來品，惟面子皮則不如。</p>
<p>該業目前困難情形有三：（三）新增貨物稅率，爲百分之十五。按該業最鈑之產景計，可收稅款僅一七〇，六二五，〇〇〇元。國庫收入爲數甚微，而製革工業之負担，則增重不少。故該業希望政府於皮革業發展時，再行征收。</p>
<p>（二）目前以洋貨傾銷，該業爲維持營業起見，只得貶價求售。三四月來各同業以賣得貨款，祗足以抵付工資及業務上之開支，故紛紛减工或停工。現在停頓狀態中者，已達十分之二。故該業希望政府禁止熱皮之進口。</p>
<p>（三）該業因高利貸之負担，成本增加。如能獲得低利貸款，則底皮每磅成本，可减二千元，面子皮亦可减低成本八百元。故希望政府准予貸給小額貸款云。</p>
<h3>保險公司資要一　起碼額度一億</h3>
<p>財政部爲整頓保險制度，充實各保險公司賠款然金，達成保險穩妥目的起見，特定各保險公司資金起碼額度爲一億元。按原爲五百萬元。已經立案開業之公司，其資本不足一億者，限本年六月底以前完淸增資查騐手續，吾則即飭令與各資金薄弱公司合併組織。至新設立者，其資金收足五千萬，可准予開業。又據保險界人士談，此次調整，實爲八年來之大改革。</p>
<h3>新大織造廠　已正式開工</h3>
<p>新大織造廠，在上海織造廠中，向稱規模宏大之絲綢廠，計有毛織絲織及棉織等部份。該廠出品，運銷南洋各地，頗負信譽。惜以管理及營運未臻局密，因而周轉不靈。自上月由新光內衣公司傅良駿氏承購全部資產以來。即詳加籌劃，健全組織，刻已正式開工。所製出品，除供製造內衣之用外，更將有新出品數種問世，據專家估計，該廠全部資產，至少在五十億以上云。</p>
<h3>國營生產事業　分別進行估價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部王部長，業於昨日抵滬記者以國營生產事業，業由政府規定以一部份充作卅六年短期庫券基金，是否仍將估價出售，叩詢王氏。渠答稱：國營生產事業之估價出售事宜，仍積極進行。此緣國營生產事業，種類繁多，機構龐大。雖有一部份栘充短期庫劵基金，惟估價出售事宜，並不因此中輟。但將來已移充短期庫劵基金之國營生產事業，當不致出售。其他部份，則仍計劃出售，讓渡民營云。</p>
<h3>多頭乘機出籠　華股高後盤低</h3>

<h3>評醫師法的「不古鳴」</h3>
<p>— 屠夫</p>
<p>三年以前，在一本中華醫學雜誌上，讀到林幾敎授評論醫師法的一篇文章，其後就很少見到有系統的檢討。復員以後，醫師法也來到了淪陷區。大家對於這倆生疏的面孔，起始感覺異樣。年來頗引起了些批評，尤其最令人不滿的是第三條約第三項，關於中醫，曾執行中醫業務五年以上卓著聲望者。即得應醫師檢覈的一點。這顯然降低了造就醫才的資格。雖中醫界的人士，並不感覺這是一種污辱歧視，至少在報章上尚不曾見到中醫公會或個人用文字表示異議。却見到有西醫公會和資歷不明的個人，紛紛抗議，要求平等待遇。換句話說，就是自認爲西醫者流，「曾經執行西醫業務五年以上卓著聲譽者」也應當可以檢覈合格。可是醫師法中，檢覈非中醫的醫師，却沒有和此相似的條文。難怪這些人「不平鳴」了。</p>
<p>其實醫師法對於中醫檢覈資格，不和科學醫同，說不上「不平一，　是中國立法的一大污點。等到幾十年或幾百年以後，我們四十孫會怎樣的怨恨嘲笑他們廿世紀的祖宗，那是不難想像的！</p>
<p>台灣淪入敵人手中之後，早　民國前十年，就停止了中醫的驚記，而努力於科學醫師的培植。到原子彈一響，敵人投降爲止，台灣的中國問題，已是完全解決。天花在台灣巳經絕跡了多年·福建的鼠疫，上海的霍亂，也已許久不能衝入。但是一經光復，台灣又回到祖國的懷抱，面不科學的中醫和已經絕跡的疫癘也都復了原料、</p>
<p>日本維新遠在中國人研究洋務以後，但是把握着了科學，努力邁進，一日千里。我們則總是徘徊在中學爲體，西學爲用的歧路上。日本軍閥雖是領導着他們的民衆走上了　武的路，然而我們不能不佩服他們對於科學的造詣和認識。日本維新的步驟，終必是我們圖强的必由之路。單就衛生的建設來說，早晚中國也必需採取日本一次登記以後停止的辦法，先行解決不科學的中醫問題，衛生建設纔可以免去一重阻碍，否則衛生建設勢必延遲下去，幾百年也不一定。而衛生事業的失敗，更必影饗到整個的建國工作。那會發生怎樣的惡果？眞令人不寒而憟！</p>
<p>醫師法的缺點甚多，然而對於科學醫師的資格克循正途。那是惟一令人差堪告慰的一點。不難想像這是立法大員中的開明份子，想爲國家保存一綫生機，力爭的結果。希望後代的子孫們在體怨你們廿世紀的祖宗的時候，不要忘記他們裏邊也有一部份是開明的。尤其是衛生當局，能做到韋宣科學個蘭細正的立塲，就</p>
<p>以往評論醫師法的人，無不把這一點去體責衛生署，要知衛生當局能勉强做到保持科學醫師的水準，已是難能可貴。要想他們能據理力爭，說服了黨國元老，即刻效法日本維新，走上科學建國的路，那就希望太高了。</p>
<p>有人說「我們的衛生當局，不是低能，而是太柔弱，沒有宵骨。」運話是對的。他們沒有輿論的支持，缺少靠山的扶助。他們不敢想應當做的事，祗是競競業業的敷衍着做一點能做的事。他們是弱者，毫沒有力量抵拒那些元老們的勢力。但是這也就是他們的罪狀，千百年後的子孫們是不會原諒的！</p>
<p>醫師法需要完全推翻，因爲他是違背了科學，不合乎時代的。况我中國憲法上又經規定了要推行公醫制度，這是世界潮流民族健康迫切的需要。理有必然，勢所必至的。於是醫師法必將從根本上重行修訂。因限於篇幅，容當另行申論之。</p>
<h3>新中醫之謎</h3>
<p>— 港貫之</p>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>中醫究竟是什麽需有一個明確的答案，這是討論中醫問題的先決條件。但是我這個發問，或許有人也要懹疑我「不通」，中醫就是中醫，沒有什麽可說。對的，中醫就是中醫，但是以往的「中醫學說」，牠是不能代表現在「職業中醫」的，「學說」和「人」必須分開來講；所以要有個明確分際的答案，並非易事。中醫學說的龐雜，和職業中醫的程度不齊，形形色色，決不是一語可以了之。中醫的「學說」是「玄一而不實的，但是不能說中醫的「人」，也是「玄」而不實的，從前西醫界的一部份人，就犯了這處毛病，他因中醫學說的要不得，就把中醫（人）也看做要不得，這種觀點，顯然是錯誤的，現在不云管他，我們回頭來看中醫自己，對中醫的本質，作何種看法，原來也是很不一致的，中醫本身就有兩種矛盾：一種是學理上的予盾，古方與時方的對時，是矛盾，空想與經騐的並立，是矛盾，其餘辯癥上的予盾，藥性論的矛盾，祗要讀過中醫書的，就知道這種矛盾多至不勝枚舉，隨手翻來，觸目皆是，說來說去，至多只能算是一家之言，連中醫自身，也是不曾「公認」的，這是講過去的中醫「學說」。再看現在的職業「中醫」吧！他們也始終沒有找到一條正確的出路，完全的保守派，不必說，可是中醫固有學說已是破產了，所以有志於中醫學的，都在盡力想發掘一個寳藏出來，到了這個末路窮途的時候，就非變法不行，那麽究竟從那一方面去變呢！運自然就是「土學化」了！照例，中醫土池代的呼聲，並不始於今日，但是化了十多年，化來化去，總沒有化得多少，這又是現在職業中醫的矛盾，還沒有認識科學化的眞諦。說起來眞也可笑，最近竟還有人說：「中醫科學化，不要西醫化」，（原文見新中華醫藥月刋第二卷三期）這種主奴之見，似乎「西醫」並不是「科學的」，可謂妙論；也有人仍認中醫是「科學與哲學」的合成品，（丁仲英先生語）同時又有陸某在友聲醫刋一經騐與玄學」一文裏，却說：中醫和玄學和哲學，並沒有什麽關聯，他們都是現在的中醫師，而自相矛盾至此，此外自署中醫叛徒的章次公先生，則謂中醫理論，可全部廢除而接受科學醫學的一切，那麽將來的「新中醫」，換句話說，就是西醫應用中藥罷了。請看他們的高論，互相鑒枘，一至於此，可見我上面的「中醫是什麼」？這個發問，實在「並無不合」，無論是過去成現在的中醫界，總沒有把自己的本質，攪得淸楚，你還能希望他們會有什麽改進嗎？不過話要說回來，中醫界眞能科學化的，也並不是沒有，而且恩個也　湯細，所以劉京周先生在上月文區！的人民警刋發表了「嘮叨」一文，說起他在「新聞報中醫主辦的刋物中」看見幾篇文字，差不多沒有一句憑着「陰陽五行」來立輸，於是對這幾位作者，表示莫大的敬意，的確中醫是進步了。可惜總先生要高明而澈底得多。誠如龐先生所說「一時轉不過身來」這裏國雖有多種原因，一部份是思想上的不澈底，及頑固派的阻力，然而睫毛令上並沒有給弛們「專身」的機會，也是事實；因爲大部份的中醫，在敎育的過程上基礎下够不能再云學習西醫，（頑固保守的當然除外）中醫旣然仍然是中醫，政府又沒有特別的設施，指示他們的「出路」，另一方面，西醫界中，也還有人反對「中醫」科學化，而且極力主張中醫應該讓他目生自滅，不必理他，這就呌他們欲「轉身」變法而不能了。所以我在這裏，希望西醫界對於道一批服從科學的新中醫，加以扶植，導八正軌，以消滅這個中丁對峙的「二元醫學」（聽京周先生語）紛爭擾攘的局面，　　　　　　　　　　　　　的前途，　　十分大關係的；因為我們　得　　在文章上寫幾個「新　　語，」總是一夠的，還要　關辦法，進一步給他們一團補充科學知識，和改良臨床忽用技衛的機會，才是眞正的科學化職權！好了，這個前言，已經寫得下少了，下面　人把現在代表一部份中醫思翅，見以阻馮中盤土學化的緯脚石，及誤解中醫科學化的學說，予以指出。於「中醫究竟是什麽？」也可附帶說明，因爲這　阻力，實在較之　先生所說「正統派」的頑固，似乎更足誤人，舏而聞之，也是決不可少的。（待續）</p>

<h3>麻疹漫談（續）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>（四）麻疹的預防和死亡率</p>
<p>在上面已經講過，麻疹一般的預後，可以說是良好的，但是和患者的健康狀態，極有關係，譬如有結核軟骨病，百日咳的患者，預後大多不良。成人的麻疹，有時也有發生重篤的症候。還有和流行的性質有關，往往在某一年大流行的時候，死亡特多。講到死亡率和年齡很有關係，吾們從統計上，知道百分之九十的麻疹死亡者，多是六歲未滿的幼兒，據德國富蘭克市一九三令年對人口十萬的各種年齡的麻疹患者及死亡數率如下表：</p>
<p>患者數　死亡數</p>
<p>〇——一歲　一八〇·〇　四五·〇</p>
<p>一——五歲　六三七·〇　二五·〇</p>
<p>六—十五歲　二五三·〇　一·四</p>
<p>十六—廿歲　一·〇　〇·〇</p>
<p>二〇—卅歲　三·三　〇·一</p>
<p>三十歲以上　〇·七　〇·〇</p>
<p>還有麻疹的死亡率，和貧富有關係，據裴氏（Blr-tillon的統計，對人口十萬比例的死亡率如下表：</p>
<p>巴黎　柏林　維也納</p>
<p>最豪富者　二·八　九·一　一·一</p>
<p>最貧者　二四·三　二八·八　十三·六</p>
<p>（五）麻疹的預防法</p>
<p>麻疹是一種傳染病，隔離當然是一種重要的方法，如果一家族中，有一個小兒發生麻疹的話，其他沒有發生麻疹的小兒，應當隔離避去，尤以麻疹的性質惡性時，更應如此。但事實上一家族中有一個小兒發生時，他兒雖則避去，也是無效，因爲在麻疹的潛伏期中（就是發疹前四天起），已有傳染力的緣故，所以有人主張除了麻疹流行惡性時，三歲未滿的小兒，患有腺病質和結核者以外，聽其傳染發生。</p>
<p>台氏（Degkwitx）應用麻疹恢復期患者血淸，即已獲得免疫性者，來預防麻疹，得到優良的效果。就是選擇沒有合併症的麻疹患者，等到他退熱以後七—九天，採取他的血淸，注射於被傳染可疑的小兒，得以預防傳染。在潛伏期中五六天以前，容易見效，七天以後，就不發生效力。如果沒有麻疹恢復期患者血淸的話，用兩親的血淸，也是有效，本法對於上面所講的麻疹惡性流行時以及三歲以下的小兒兼患有結核和百日咳等的時候，是爲適宜。</p>
<p>（六）看護麻疹的幾電注意</p>
<p>世人對於疾病，往往注決定到醫藥，而忽略於看護；實際上看護很重要，一不小心的話，可以差之毫厘，失之千里，現在把看護麻疹應當注意的地方，沛條約寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）保持溫暖，麻疹需要溫暖，是大家都知道的事情，最好室溫保持攝氏十八度，但是也有疏忽的父母，任令小兒受寒，則或夜間不小心，小兒自己被褥踢去，因爲受寒的緣故，容易引起肺炎。</p>
<p>（二）使室內空氣濕潤，用噴霧器使水蒸氣散佈室內，可以令咳痰順利。</p>

<h3>跑馬廳改建問題</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>英法人在上海租界的時期，固然是一種殖民政策，但文化方面，也不能說沒有一點成績。工部局辦的學校，及公園街道，房屋建築物，也頗影響中國內地的改造。此次接收淪陷區，大家把視綫集中在物資上却很少有人注意到文化！</p>
<p>英法人在上海都有博物院圖書館，如亞洲文會辦的博物院，收藏豐富，特別是人類學，收藏着許多珍品，驚動世界的「北京人」頭蓋骨，也在其中。此外還有五萬多册西文書。法人方面如震旦博物院，除動植物外，特別是昆虫其中尚有米經人研究過的種類。法文協會圖書館，藏書也有數萬册。這都是英法人所留下來的成績，都經營了八九十年，至少也有五六十年之久！這種文化寳庫，我們應當切實繼續扶持它，也應該由國際文化機關，多多補助他經費。</p>
<p>日前本報曾主張將上海跑馬廳改建公園，我覺得非常合理，並且建議在這座偉大的公園裏，附建世界博物院，院內陳列中國自然佔主要部分，還可以請聯合國文化科學敎育會，微求各國文物，這樣，自不難造成最豐富而冠美的東方唯一的大博物院，俾歐美人士初到中國者，就能窺見東方文化的珍貴，且可與各國文化比較，這是何等偉大的事業呀！</p>
<p>博物院旁，如空地寬廣，財力充裕，還可建築一座圖書館，一座劇院和一座美術館，以及運動塲，音樂台等等，這樣往日的跑馬廳便成了上海的文化中心區。空塲上還可以舉行農工等業博覽會，可以舉行市民大會，也可以舉行體育競賽，露天音樂演奏……</p>
<p>我們理想的上海，是全世界最新式的花園都市，也是東亞的文化中心，世界文化的總匯。一切設施，都用最新的科學工業的技術修建起來，再用最高的文學美術的形式裝飾起來；把人生的興趣提高，使人類的文化積極的交流，使國際的文化城，是擁護人道主持正義的光榮城市，好像古希臘的雅典一樣。不過雅典所象徵的是狹窄的愛國思潮，還沒有世界大同的健全意識呢！</p>
<h3>藝海勺嘗錄</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>昔梅聖俞有詩云：「野性好書畫，無力能自致；每遇高趣人，常許出以視。」余每誦此語輙爲啞然，蓋不啻若自其口出也。余旣觀張子伯駒所藏寳繪法書，以其皆絕塵之品，輙爲疏記。番禺葉遐菴師於報端見之，亦欲一觀。而同時伯駒友好顧　諸公亦緣見報而集於伯駒館舍，余復數得追陪而縱覽焉。其中有前記所未備者。因再追記之如次。</p>
<p>一·趙孟頫小楷蓮華經卷此松雪所書妙法蓮華經第三卷。通卷首尾完整。世傳趙吳興小楷落筆如飛，蓋不惟工整之難，而惟其速之難也。若非運筆神速則公傳世小楷決無如此之多。此卷非公最精之品。然用筆起落轉折處，軒豁可尋。</p>
<p>二·趙孟類草書千文淸宮舊藏，其引乎錦裝已破損矣。此卷紙墨均遠較前卷爲佳。公所書千文甚多，余所見者以此本爲甲觀。其用筆圓勁豐逸，純乎智永之法，而結體特多章草。蓋是有意學水師，而故弄狡獪以變化結體者耳。後有柳貫跋作懷素草書。余所見貫跋尾書皆半寸許楷字。此作草似欲以醉僧配永師耶。其書不高。又千文紙尾一行上有「松雪齋圖書記」長方印，篆文甚小，亦不常見。</p>
<p>三·文徵明閩荔吳栽卷此爲衡山精心興會之作。所謂「閩荔吳栽」者，據圖後衡山所賦新荔篇詩序云，「常熟顧氏，自閩中移荔枝數種，經歲遂活。沈石田令人折枝視之，桂葉森森，未敢自信。以視閩人，良是！因作新荔篇命壁同賦。」居頃之，又爲寫生。即此閩荔吳栽卷也。在昔山川間阻，異鄉殊不及目覩。是以「見駱駝以爲馬腫背。」而「桂葉森森，」遂使石田翁不敢信其爲荔。此滬人今　所謂「阿木林」也。若使文沈之流生於今日，飛航之便，不崇朝而至，豈特鮮荔不奇，且有在危城淪陷之時以飛機載狗者矣！然今之貴人雖能以飛機載狗，顧無山以絹素　荔。此又使石田　山得以「阿木林」而奴視「康白度」也！衡山所畫絹木閩荔十枝，書冊極妍，皆用古法。全　讀吳荷屋辛丑消夏記，載蔡君漢所繪荔枝。余未見蔡畫，不知神妙何如。若衡山此卷，枝葉扶疏，絳衣班駁，使人心折矣。卷後紙本衡山自書和沈石田新荔篇長古。詩旣秀發，書允流美。中有誤書添注一二處。正姜白石所謂偶有誤書不以爲病者。</p>
<p>四·方從義雲林鍾秀圖卷此方方壺雲林鍾秀卷紙本墨畫。畫首「雲林鍾秀」四字。畫尾上端「洪武丁已方壺子作贈鄧止菴還朝」十四字，畫中高崗斗絕有若摩崖書者「方方壺畫」四字此三者皆隸書。後有沈石田題詩云「上淸仙子本天仙，下謫來修水墨緣。聞道琵琶嶺頭月，照歸黃鶴又千年」。余觀此畫雖大體用米氏雲山之意，然其岡　峻特，雲氣氤氳。其畫雲筆力橫恣瀟洒，非米氏之法所能限，而於岡頭署名，亦遠溯唐人之例。葉遐菴師云，此畫計有叫木。贋品之多可想。其語繁，不備記。而以此本爲眞。</p>
<p>又余前記伯駒五元人畫卷，今又得重觀，計爲趙仲穆，王　，朱澤民，張規，方方　，其朱澤民一輻左下角有朱文「沈周寶玩」四字小印，補記於此。</p>
<p>五·吳歷興福菴感舊圖卷此畫絹本。吳漁山甲寅年所繪，以追悼方外之友默容和尚者也。上有漁山手記與默師爲筆墨良友，附以追悼二詩。按興福菴在常熟，其菴今尚存。漁山此圖叢柯落葉，羣鴉翔止，經房空寂，孤鶴不鳴。一種悲風颯瘋之情狀，聽之仿彿有聲。古人云，情以生文，文亦生情。此畫情筆相生，觀之悽愴，使人慨然增死生朋友之重。眞絕作也！</p>
<p>六·錢舜舉山居圖卷此卷紙本。用小李將軍金碧山水之法。其淸綠凝重之中，自有一種淸逸曠遠之趣，所以爲高也。葉遐菴師云，曾見一本與此本意境用筆，及紙冠全相似。此本後無款識。而彼本有之。此本前有「山居圖」三字而彼本無之。疑是一本，在明代已割而爲二矣。未知何故。此卷，原是高江村所藏，有其跋尾。入民國歸邵松年。邵跋書凡數則。皆小楷精　。蓋邵小眞書，當時亦頗有聲云。</p>
<p>七·米友仁姚山秋齋圖卷此卷後有趙肅題定爲米虎兒所書。肅字彥恭，松雪之子也。</p>
<p>八·文徵明三友圖文待詔墨畫蘭菊及竹三幅，紙本，皆有題詩。畫蘭書作東坡體，菊作山谷體。題竹書則自家面目也。稚柳云，世傳沈石田畫多豪健之筆，文衡山則所傳多工緻者。故世以「粗文細沈」爲貴。衡山此三幅意境蕭然，在筆墨之外，蓋一時遺興之作，而自得天眞者也。</p>
<p>九·宋徽宗雪江歸棹圖卷眞蹟此爲希世之寳。即王　洲兄弟所藏，張江陵在相位時欲强奪之而不遂者也。如此劇蹟，不宜草草爲記。當俟暇日晴窗，心情曠悅之時細識之。</p>

<h3>古代美的特質</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>推究美的壓史可以說是與人顚的歷史同時開始，這不僅在廣義上被稱爲文化學的考古學，人種學以及地質學等立塲可以證實。而且在其他如可謂生物學之美學的各種藝術起源論或者社會學和藝術學上，也可以明白的證實。尤其是近代藝術科學的發達，越使我們相信美的發生與人類的發生是在同一個時期的。——就是人類在其發端已有美的創造，雖然他是極幼稚的——這我們也用不着引用古羅斯·格勒施·菲隆·翁特·赫然史太因·哈巴特·麗都·拉羅等之學說。</p>
<p>由於可認爲原始古代人創造的發掘物的詳細而嚴密的調查與推論結果，我們可以知道，在數萬年以前的地球上，有長於美的工作技術的生物，至少有屬於比動物高等之生物的原人存在。原人的存在在學問上的範圍以內，不過是由在法國曁西班牙發見的骨格，在岩石上畫的圖骨片彫刻，拿野牛等作題材且極簡單的畫等，可以推想。可是我們很容易想到這種原始人不僅在這幾個地方而且在亞洲以及其他大陸上也可能有其存在的。</p>
<p>話雖如此，可是時代是四·五萬年以前的事情，而且這稱最古原始人是經過考古學上的古石器時代，新石器時代以及靑銅與鐵的金屬器時代，所謂原始文化的三個時代，分種種階段，逐漸進化而來的。其美的表現方法亦因人種與地方而不同。所以對於原始人的生活狀態或藝術特質很難予以概括陳述，例如有的人種對於彫刻或繪畫的高級描寫藝術表現造形才能，而另外一個人種不過在身體裝飾或舞隔上表現出若干藝術才能。因此在其美的標凖或文化程度自有高低的差別。</p>
<p>拿現象看來，最初的古石器時代有狩獵與邀牧生活，新石器時代有農耕生活的開端，而在最後的金屬器時代始有漸用日常器具的家族生活歷史。</p>
<p>就是在此時期，始可發見遊收生活變成集團生活的初期徵象，同時也可以知道由各種生活條件發生的各種美的表現方式，將徐徐變成次一代的眞正文化古代人及古代生活。——即有組織的社會機構中，造成高度集團藝術文化的古代民族及古代國家。——這說社會學者或人種學者所稱的「原始民族」或「自然民族」的未開化的太古人種，將進化成更開化的古代文明民族；而且這種較開化的民族，擁有有組織的狩獵撈漁牧畜耕種以及石和金屬的生產或發明。而從這種文化生活中漸漸產生適應這種生活的美的理想或表現，就是水準較高的造形美術。</p>
<p>從此開始民族的大移動，和古代以此時代爲轉機，由前世紀跳到新世紀而劃出顯然的兩個世代。這種新世代的民族已經不是沒有組織的自然民族，其藝術文化也不是前一個世代那樣簡單。亞洲系最古的黃褐色人種埃及人斯美利亞人巴比侖人以及歐洲系最古的白色人種，希臘人各各建立的古代國家和古代美術，就是這種民族。</p>
<p>如此，眞正像樣的文化，像稱的藝術是隨着國家的成立而形成的。在古代民族中被稱爲三大民族的哈姆族系埃及人，米索彼塔米亞地方的賽姆族系民族白人文化始祖的阿里盎系希臘人，他們雖然稍有前後，可是略在同一時期，就是在紀元前十數世紀或數世紀的古時代建設文化國家。在這兒我們可以發見古代社會，古代民族，古代藝術，密切結合而發展的歷史。</p>
<p>美之於古代，換言之古典美是可謂與此種三大民族之興隆同時開始的高度文化現象，同時代的古代民族尚有其他波斯人希伯莱人菲尼基人，以及多島海一帶的所謂地中海民族，更有繼承希臘文化的古代羅馬人等；不過古代藝術文化均以前述跨在菲洲，西方亞洲，南方歐洲的三大民族爲其始源。所以可以埃及，米索波塔米亞，希臘認爲古代的典型。」</p>
<p>這種三大民族所代表的古代美雖然各有各的性格，可是應該注意埃及，米索波塔米亞，希臘的藝術文化有一個共通普遍的美的特質：這個普遍性是三個古代國家各各有其神，有其爲公服務的生活目標，有其火的理想美。就是說都有如同與民族創造精神密切結合的神話，表現崇拜祖先之神性美的神廟神像；表現共同歡喜的國民祭典，由崇拜帝王，英雄，或自然而來的對於巨大物的服務等民族大理想的美的象徵，以及其造形表現。</p>
<h3>紐約十夜（哥倫比亞大學門前）（水彩）</h3>
<p>— 王少</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血309</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見想了一想，便吩咐下女，打電話到大使館，問明中村小姐什麼時候到那裹，是否還在那裘。要是離開了，什麼時候離開的。</p>
<p>下女答應着，走了兩步却又回頭，瞧着鶴見：</p>
<p>「也許中村小姐還上別的地方去？」</p>
<p>「噢！」鶴見定睛瞧着下女；「你怎麼推想到這一點？」</p>
<p>「中村小姐剛要出去，收到過一封信；我看見小姐把信看過，很仔細把信上的什麼字句，寫在小手册　了，也許就是地名？……」</p>
<p>「信呢？……還在小姐房子裏嗎？」鶴見更加不安起來。</p>
<p>「還在屋子裏吧。我……」</p>
<p>「是的，快去拿來罷！」鶴見揮着手。</p>
<p>下女翩然出去，立即奔回，手上拿着</p>
<p>一封折開過的信。鶴見接過信來，見信封上。兩而都沒有收信及回信地址，顯然是差人遞來的；取出信來，信箋上用日文寫着：</p>
<p>「中村小姐：收到電訊，知小姐南來，未注明上海寓處，乃着人訪投。小姐收到此信，如得暇，即請於上午八時至下午四時之間，移玉江邊外灘公園，見一着白色和服，手挾紅色西書者，即懇接見。西平手上。」</p>
<p>「還是請去先打電話罷。」鶴見吩咐下女。下女應聲而去。</p>
<p>「上海竟這等複雜，這等厲害！倒沒料到哩……鶴見負起手來，在屋子裏空處，來回　蹀着。</p>
<p>「這由於隊長沒到上海來過，一時抓不到頭緒；其實並不十分複雜：『租界』裏，支那軍政活動除外，只有靑紅兩個帮口，却是有組織的，比軍政界組織還有决序。靑帮最活躍，表面似乎紛繁，可是最高廣命令，可以直達最低層，只要『一句話』，百分之百有效力。……」</p>
<p>「噢？……有這門嚴緊的組織？」鶴見有些懷疑。</p>
<p>「那是由於傳統的迷信潛力造成的——江湖義氣——支那現政府軍隊北上，用過他們一次，上次閘北衝突事件（指一，二八之戰）他們也有良好的表現……」</p>
<p>「這很有趣味哩……」鶴見似乎很注意。</p>
<p>「其餘是主管『租界』的兩個西洋人勢力團；這，隊長當然知道，……可是這勢力團底層，還有一種華洋組織，也有一種勢力——一面依仗西洋勢力，一面也與靑帮發生些關係——不過，最亂糟糟的，還是我們這一方面的，（指“倭一邊的）。所以關於支那方面的，只須　網　領，跟他們頭目交涉，就可弄明白…」</p>
<p>「你剛才說的那個朋友，就是這些帮裹的人？」鶴見記起了正岩「託朋友打聽」的那句話。</p>
<p>「哦！」正岩來不及更正似的，「不，不是！那是另外一個神秘而又公開的組織，團體十分淸潔；只有十幾位高等人物。」</p>
<p>「什麼樣的高等人物？」鶴見更加注意了。</p>
<p>「一時說不明白，」正岩有些恍惚似的，「連部下也沒有弄淸楚。看他們的行動，好像古代的劍道俠客……</p>
<h3>零的增加</h3>
<p>— 報童</p>
<p>對任何算式都是可資學習的，然而唯有零的增加，使我們覺得異常的不幸。在從前，個人收人上，零的增加是一種奇跡，但是在今天，紙幣已從單數肥胖到五位數字時，這之間，衡量起生活，是不能以道里計的。這在數學上也許是不可謬忍的錯誤，可是，在現實間，就我們所知，零的增加與未增零以前的數字恒常是相等的，你當然不承認四位數字與五位數字能够相等，因爲多了一位數字，多了一個零；可是，在生活的溫度計上，我們常可以作這樣的算式，在半年前的四位數字與半年後的五位數字間劃下一個正確的等號。</p>
<p>也許這是一種遊戲吧，一種數字的遊戲吧。</p>
<p>願每個人能從零中探出頭來，能從一串零旁挨向前去，不幸的是眞如字宙的無限大一樣，零的增加也是無限大的，這樣的長途競走終究是疲困之至的，趕過一零？又是一個零。</p>
<p>詩曰：山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村。祇怕是前面雖有憇脚處，而行百里者半九十，這最後的一段辰光，誰的脚力都不勝任。論起生活，我們已如邱吉爾先生一樣，認爲最好莫如一九四六年以前了。一九四六年以後的路是一條最窄的路，窄得不能容下人走。</p>
<p>現在，衹有作這樣的希望，對零的增加，命令它：停止！</p>
<h3>一個標幟</h3>
<p>— 心耳</p>
<p>又是「兒童節」。</p>
<p>早上打開報紙才知道。這時才想到一點感想，可見得感覺的遲鈍。有兒童節顯然是一種進步，因爲說明我們已注意到兒童了。</p>
<p>兒童節轉眼一天，就要過去，然而兒童是還存在的。我總覺得「兒童節」彷彿是大人們的一種恩典。猶如長輩給孩子們壓歲錢，固然有讓孩子們歡喜的或份，然而大抵則是裝面子的。</p>
<p>如果有人說，民國以來的中國，實在沒有什麼進步。這說法誠然是使我們動氣的。</p>
<p>譬如「兒童節」，民國以前當然沒有，而現在有了。其實這還是大人的東西，大人沒有什麼辦法的時候，大抵還是裝不出什麼面子來的。因此也難說兒童節便是一種進步。不過旣然有了，總是算注意到孩子了，我想孩子們總會一年年好起來吧，這才是眞的進步了。</p>
<p>記得亞當斯密斯在「原富」一書中很多部份描寫到中國，有一處說結婚，在中國是受到獎勵的，但獎勵的方法是什麼呢？是有殺害兒童的自由。在各個大城市衷，每天晚上有棄嬰發現在街頭巷尾，或者簡直被拋入水裏。而且據傳還有一種靠殺嬰吃飯的職業者。</p>
<p>亞當斯密期說這話時，離開我們丸的是一百七十年。而這話對目前的上海或全中國仍然適用。</p>
<p>亞當斯密斯的原意，當然頗易明白，他並不是說眞有獎勵殺害兒童的法律訂出來。中國的社會倫理中，父母的絕對權力，正反映出封建專制的政治制度。結婚之後，即隨時可以成爲父母，一爲父母，這絕對權力便俱與偕來了。「小杖則受，大杖則走。」古之聖人，對怎樣爲兒子已頗有敎訓了。</p>
<p>斯密斯頗爲幽默地說着「殺害兒意的自由」，說着「職業者」，意在表明中國社會的停滯。這是事實，這種停滯雖然經過辛亥革命和八年抗戰，還沒有中止，所以這種現象至今依然。</p>
<p>斯密斯說過一句欠通透頂的話。說中國雖然停滯，却還沒有退步，因爲被居民遺棄的城市還未見過。</p>
<p>居民固然未曾遺棄都市，而都市却在遺棄居民。這在一百七十年以前的斯密斯老先生，實在是不易辨解的。</p>
<p>儘管裝點着兒童節，而實際上社會還是停滯。我們大的已看到英國生育子女的政府津貼，以及日本兒童都營養得很好的報童紀載吧？看社會的進步或退步，以如何對待兒童爲標幟，大約是不會錯的。（四月四日）</p>

<h3>弟弟年紀比哥哥大</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>在這世界上，眞有不少的希奇古怪的東西和事情。這裏筆者來告訴你們一件更奇怪的事情，就是弟弟的年紀會比哥哥大。</p>
<p>我們知道，在太平洋上有一條日期變更錢，照地理學上說，是東西經一八〇度的子午綫。事實上這條綫並不是劃直的，因爲要避去陸地的緣故，在這條綫上經過就會跳過二十四小時，譬如十二月卅一日從東向西過這條綫，就是第二年的一月二日，可說是少過了一年的元旦，但是十二月卅一日末和一月二日的始，是接連的並不是日曆上少了一張。</p>
<p>若是一個孕婦，在渡太平洋的船上，從中國到美國去，剛巧在經過這日期的時候，假定是一九四七年的一月一日十二點鐘產了一個男孩，隔了十五分鐘，又產了一個孼生子，這位小弟弟的生日，是一九四六年的十二月卅一日，不是弟弟的年紀比哥哥大了嗎？</p>
<p>在日期綫一邊的一九四六年除夕，用無綫電收到一九四七年慶祝元旦的音樂。反過來就是今年又可聽到去年的唱歌，一個人在十二月卅一日死的，但是有人曾在第二年的元旦，實實在在還看見過他活着的。這都是日期綫弄的把戲。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦獸鷗</p>
<p>老祝從徐胖子那裏已經也聽到了一些關於她和諸老頭兒的事了，可是他對於這一個意志不定的女人，向來就祇有一種鄙薄的憐憫，並不如何關切，因此也就沒有深究。</p>
<p>「想上藝術館去，還沒有一定」。他坦率地告訴她。</p>
<p>「那末請我吃一次點心怎麼樣？明天我就要走了」！她把身子靠近着老祝，　柔地說。</p>
<p>老祝向她看了一眼。金愛麗正用着懇求的神氣注視着他。</p>
<p>「好吧！你願意上那裏去」？</p>
<p>對方的臉上頓時透出了一種興奮的神情。</p>
<p>「鳳北路的熱麵包，你愛吃嗎」，她的聲音是更柔媚了。</p>
<p>老祝點點頭，拉着她就望汽車裏鑽。</p>
<p>「這大概是協座的賽車吧」？他調侃似的說。</p>
<p>金愛麗很忸怩地一笑，耳根有一些红，並不回答。老祝也就不再追問下去。</p>
<p>賣熱麵包和豆漿的廣東店裹生意很淸，人們急於逃難，連食慾也减退了。</p>
<p>「風聲緊得很，你們還不想走嗎」？金愛麗很關心地問。</p>
<p>老祝正端着豆漿狂飲。</p>
<p>「眞的，不騙你！昨兒老諸他們都說黎公館的一架專機也飛走了，情形眞不對呢」！金愛麗又强調着說。</p>
<p>「可是，我们走不成也沒法啊」！老祝搖搖頭，仍然是嬉皮笑臉的。「他們要人坐飛機，你們闊人坐汽車，還有路道粗一些的人坐火車，我們呢？只能拼囤條腿不着，到眞要逃的時候再說」！</p>
<p>金愛麗正在斯文地嚼吃一塊塗滿牛油的麵包，聽了老祝的話，也有些戚然不歡起來。</p>
<p>「老祝」！她的头凑近着老祝的肩膀，用極低的聲音說：「你要錢嗎」？</p>
<p>祝兆年差一些哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>「有人說諸老頭兒給了你許多美金，是不是」？他向她反問，但並不對她看。</p>
<p>被問的人底面頰完全漲紅了，低下頭，不說什麼；一會兒，眼眶裏便充满了熱淚。</p>
<p>老祝並沒有注意她，取起一只熱氣蒸騰的圓麵包來，大口的吞嚼。（三六）</p>

<h3>Intensified Blockade of Mountainous Areas in Shandong Province; Communist Troops Prepare to Disperse and Flee; National Army Conducts Large-Scale Sweep in Northern Henan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The National Army on the east side of the Jinpu Railway continues to sweep through the mountainous areas, and on the 4th, it recovered Liangshan, Wo Niu Mountain, Zao Shu Ling, Shangxia Wan, and other strongholds located 25 kilometers southwest of Feixian County.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, 5th] On the 4th, the National Army in Southern Shandong had completely cleared out the scattered communist troops between the Linzao branch line and Feixian County, and joined the National Army on the Jinpu front and those advancing from Jinan to strengthen the blockade of the northwest, south, and three sides of the Yimeng Mountain area.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The communist troops trapped in the Yimeng Mountain area are now renamed the East China Field Army. The original newly formed liberation divisions have been reorganized into ten columns, each column with three divisions. It is widely believed that this move by the communist troops is a preparation to disintegrate into smaller units, hoping to individually flee during the National Army's search of the mountains.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The communist troops under Liu Bocheng, gathering a crowd of 70,000, launched a desperate attack on the Pinghan Railway and Daoqing Railway in Northern Henan, making a final struggle. By the 4th, they had suffered a disastrous defeat, with almost their entire army annihilated. The remaining communist troops fled in disarray, no longer able to form any organized resistance. Along the way, in groups of three or five, they surrendered to the National Army. The captured and surrendered communist officers and soldiers all had swollen eyes, red eyes, broken feet, and limped, appearing like ghosts. This is because the communist troops in this operation were mostly strong men newly coerced by Liu Bocheng in Western Shandong, who traveled day and night, only eating two meals of thin millet porridge each day. Now they have been forcibly driven to the front line in Northern Henan to fill the sea of fire, which is extremely inhumane. For example, from the 30th to the 3rd, Yang Yong led more than 10,000 communist troops to fiercely attack the Yellow River Railway Bridge for four days and nights. As a result, only one communist soldier reached the barbed wire fence before being shot dead. The rest all perished before reaching the barbed wire fence, demonstrating the intense firepower of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] Telegraph and train services from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang were both restored on the 4th. On the 3rd, the National Army in Northern Henan launched a large-scale sweep northward along the Pinghan Railway from Yuancun. On the evening of the 3rd, they joined forces with the National Army in Xinxiang. The remaining communist troops along the way collapsed and fled eastward along the Pinghan Railway in different directions. Furthermore, the 2nd, 3rd, 12th, 13th, and 4th brigades and the guard brigade of the 17th Division of the communist troops attacking Xinxiang fled northwest of Huixian County on the afternoon of the 4th at 6 p.m. The 2nd, 7th, 6th, and other columns of the communist troops attacking Jixian County retreated northeast toward Huaxian County on the afternoon of the 4th. The National Army is in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The remnants of the communist troops under Jin Shaoshan, Wang Qimei, and Wei Fenglou in Eastern Henan were annihilated by the National Army regiment on the 3rd. On the afternoon of the 4th, they collapsed and fled in different directions. One group of over 4,000 fled to Yangyipu, 10 kilometers west of Milin, and another group of over 1,000 attacked Ningling, where they are engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops. However, the National Army has completed the encirclement and will soon annihilate them.</p>
<h3>National Army in Northern Shaanxi Continues to Advance; Recovers Anding, Baotuan, and Jiulishan; Key Pass of Laoduyaguan Also Captured</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Battle News from Northern Shaanxi: (1) The National Army advancing from both east and west after recovering Wayaobao continues to progress. The western advance forces recovered Anding City again on the afternoon of the 4th at 5 p.m., and the communist troops retreated toward Hengshan. The eastern advance forces have joined up with the forces bypassing Jiulishan north from Qingjian at Nangoucha, southwest of Suide. (2) On the morning of the 4th, the National Army ascended the key pass of Jiulishan. Three stone fortress positions on the mountain have been occupied. The communist troops counterattacked more than ten times, but were all repelled. The ferocity of the battle was unprecedented in the Northern Shaanxi campaign. Jiulishan is now surrounded on the east, west, south, and three sides. (3) Laoyaguan, northeast of Qingjian, was fiercely attacked by the National Army from three sides. After the remaining 500 communist troops defending the pass ran out of ammunition, they retreated to Zhendongjie. The key pass was finally recovered. (4) The Ma Hongbin troops, which recovered Dingbian, continued to advance eastward and were pressing on Anbian Fort on the 4th. (5) In the Battle of Wayaobao, the communist troops suffered heavy casualties. Over 4,000 bodies were left behind by over 20,000 casualties, over 1,000 were captured, and over 500 surrendered. Both the east and west cities were flattened by artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After recovering Pinglu, the National Army in Northern Shanxi is advancing along the east bank of the Yellow River toward Pianguan, Hequ, Baode, and Xingxian, guarding against communist troops in Northern Shaanxi crossing the river eastward. The Liu Zongyi unit of the Yanmen Military Region of the communist troops, with over 12,000 men, is currently concentrated in the Ningwu area, appearing to be holding onto the Yanmen Mountains. The Yao Zhe unit of the Suiyuan-Mongolia communist troops also shows signs of moving toward Wusai and Pianguan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Taiyuan, 5th] The National Army recovered Mengxian County on March 28. Nineteen of the city walls and civilian houses were destroyed. Refugees who had fled are returning to their hometowns one after another. The provincial government is preparing to implement emergency relief measures.</p>
<h3>Another Major Battle to Unfold in the Nong'an and Fuyu Area</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th] The National Army and the communist troops who recklessly crossed the Songhua River northward for the fifth time may engage in another major battle in the Nong'an and Fuyu area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jilin, 5th] Due to the National Army's continuous suppression, the small group of communist troops disturbing Changshantun (30 kilometers north of Huadian) in Southern Jilin has now crossed the river and fled eastward. Furthermore, there is a communist regiment in the Huashulinzi area northeast of Huadian, attempting to make trouble. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. It is also learned that the 8th and 9th Brigades of the communist troops in Jinchuanlou Street (southeast of Chaoyang Town) have fled southwest after being swept by the National Army. It is further learned that about one division of communist troops has gathered in the Yushu Lalin River area. Also, the communist troops in Xiushuidianzi have been moving westward in large numbers in recent days, with some having reached the riverbank. Communist troops from Yushu have arrived in Xiushuidianzi, seemingly preparing to defend against the National Army's advance.</p>
<h3>Tumenling Tunnel to Be Thoroughly Repaired</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 4th] The Jilin Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has allocated a budget of 20 million circulating currency to start the restoration project of the Tumenling Tunnel on the Jilin-Changchun Railway to ensure the safety of transportation between Jilin and Changchun. The tunnel, which is four kilometers long, was severely damaged when the communist troops launched their third offensive in Southern Songjiang in late February. Because the railway was anxious to resume traffic, it only temporarily cleared the rubble and sand that had collapsed inside the tunnel. Now, it plans to completely repair it to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Press Corps Visits Yan'an, Interviews Civilians and Captives</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaozhou Will Speak on His Return and Issue Relief</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 5th] On the morning of the 5th, the press corps visited wounded soldiers and inspected the defensive works built by the communist troops. In the afternoon, they inspected war spoils, interviewed civilians and captives, and attended a symposium with Director Deng Wenyi and Director Gu Xiping. In the evening at 7 o'clock, Chief Hu held a reception. The group is scheduled to fly back to Xi'an on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 5th] From morning to noon on the 5th, the press corps, in addition to visiting war spoils and the luxurious headquarters residences of Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Ye Jianying in Wangjiaping, spent most of their time in the First and Second Patriotic Youth Reception Centers, which housed the captured communist officers and soldiers. According to statistics, the National Army captured a total of 10,184 communist officers and soldiers during the Yan'an campaign. 1,705 were sent to hospitals due to illness, 1,514 died from serious injuries, 3,578 were sent back to their hometowns, 2,330 were sent to Xi'an, and 1,057 remained in Yan'an. The First Reception Center housed 898 people, and the Second Reception Center housed 159 people. In addition to the generally more sincere talks with the civilians, the Deputy Commander of the 1st Brigade of the communist police Chen Guodong, the Commander of the 771st Regiment Wu Yuxian, and the Chief of the Special Operations Section of the Security Department of the Communist Party of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Han Ji'en, were interviewed in detail. Chen and Wu were stubborn and delusional, spouting nonsense. Han, who had been handling special operations for the Communist Party for many years and was extremely familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party, spoke at length to the press corps about his participation in the Communist Party, internal contradictions within the Communist Party, and the communist troops' preparations to defend Yan'an to the death. The details of how the Communist Party forced the people to grow opium in Yan'an and how they plundered the people were all told to the reporters by the militiamen who had been taken in.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 4th] The largest press corps, consisting of more than 40 units, and the first to arrive in Yan'an, the Beijing-Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Press Corps, inspected the relics of the Communist Party in the suburbs by car after participating in the review of the National Army stationed in Yan'an at 2 p.m. on the 4th. Apart from a library that was burned down by Mao Zedong, everything in places such as the Communist Party's Social Department and Kang Sheng's residence in Yan'an, the Central Auditorium of the Communist Party in Yangjialing, and the offices and residences of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Lu Dingyi, was in good condition. The furniture was displayed as before, and even baby beds and toys had not been taken away. Many places even had a seal affixed by the Administrative Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party with the words "Entry without permission is prohibited." This shows the urgency of their escape. In front of the Communist Party Central Party School in Wenhua Gou, there were slogans discrediting the head of state and the government. Inside, the tables and chairs were broken and littered with wheat straw, and the place was in a state of disarray because the 6th Cavalry Division of the communist troops had occupied it as a barracks before the Communist Party fled. This is sufficient proof of the decay of the communist troops' military discipline. Qingliang Mountain in the north of Yan'an City was the location of the Communist Party's Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Xinhua News Agency, and Liberation Daily. It has also been burned down, but regrettably, due to the lateness of the hour, there was no time to climb up and see it. It is only known that one part of the machinery has been taken away and another part buried underground. There are many remnants of newspapers in the ruins. On the way, we saw groups of kidnapped civilians returning, with unkempt hair and dirty faces, looking pitiful.

The President and Madame Chiang walked briskly and chatted and laughed freely. During the ceremonies, they reminisced with the clan elders and expressed great concern for their recent situation. After the ritual, the President and Madame Chiang and their descendants and attendants went to the tomb of his father, Chiang Gong, behind the mountain for a simple and solemn ceremony. After returning to town, they held sacrifices at the Chiang clan ancestral hall. After the sacrifices, they returned to Fenzhuang and went to Madame Wang's tomb in Yulin'ao at 3:30 p.m. The mountain was lush and green, with dense pine forests. The words "Cian An" are inscribed on the tomb chamber, followed by an epitaph. The back of the monument commemorating the National Father's sacrifice to Chiang's mother is engraved with a brief account of President Chiang's libation to his mother, painted by Yu Youren. There are six stone tablets erected on both walls, all of which are the National Government and Kuomintang's awards for President Chiang's literary tablets. To the right of the pavilion is the President's residence, simple and unadorned. Today, the President and Madame Chiang presided over the sacrifices. Shen Honglie, Chen Yaoqing, Wu Xiao and others all sent wreaths, and Shen Honglie accompanied them in the sacrifices, expressing the utmost grief. Afterwards, they went down the mountain to the former residence of Fenghao, where twelve clan brides performed a temple visit to the President and Madame Chiang, offering tea as a gesture of respect. Madame Chiang smiled and offered her congratulations, and the President repeatedly said, "Good, good." They then watched the villagers' festival near Wuling, with dragon dances, boat races, and gongs and drums. Firecrackers filled the sky, and music sounded in all directions, making it the liveliest day in Xikou in ten years. At around 7 p.m., the President hosted a banquet for more than 30 members of the clan at the Fenghao official residence, divided into five tables. In previous years, when he returned home, there was only one table. This time, he was particularly excited. During the banquet, they discussed ancient and modern times and inquired about recent situations in great detail. The President said that this trip was the most enjoyable, as he had been working hard for the country for the past ten years, and this was his first rest. After the meal, a lantern procession was held under the command of Chiang Guoquan, the head of the clan, and the scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xikou, 5th] The people of Xikou believe that the President's return after a decade of absence has added luster to the mountains and rivers, and the whole clan is rejoicing. It was decided by the people of the village and the disciples of the Chiang and Ren clans that a lantern festival would be held by the whole town and that the Chiang and Ren clans would perform Ping opera for three days in the Chiang clan ancestral hall to show their welcome. The President, not wanting to dismiss the villagers' gracious intentions, agreed to their request. Today, after the clan members worshiped their ancestors in the Chiang clan ancestral hall, they began to perform plays on the stage in the hall. The people of the whole town, young and old, helped each other and went to watch the plays. Some came from dozens of miles away. In the evening, a lantern festival was held, with various colored lanterns and various miscellaneous items of local scenery. The sounds of cheers and firecrackers resounded throughout the sky.

<h3>Tanggu Northwest US Armory Attacked by Communist Troops in Planned Assault; US Marines Repel Attack, Five Killed, Sixteen Wounded</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 5th] According to an announcement by the US military stationed in Tianjin, at approximately 1:00 AM on the 5th, an unidentified unit of unknown size attacked the munitions supply depot of the US Marine Corps First Division near Tanggu. By 5:10 AM, the attack was repelled by the Marines, with the attacking force fleeing north. Five US soldiers were killed and sixteen wounded. Also, at dawn on the 5th, the US ammunition depot in the Xinhe area east of Tianjin was also attacked by Communist forces, but they were repelled by dawn.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] The US armory near Tanggu was suddenly attacked on the morning of the 5th by approximately 2,000 armed men of unknown origin. According to a statement from the First Marine Division's press office, at 1:15 AM on the 5th, an unspecified number of troops attacked the First Division's armory near Tanggu. At 5:30 AM, the attacking force was driven back north. Five US defenders were killed and sixteen wounded.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Tianjin reports: The US armory attacked near Tanggu is located at Sidaoqiao, five miles northwest of Tanggu. The Communist attack was highly organized, with the aim of overwhelming the small garrison in the area. The Communist offensive appeared to be a coordinated effort, simultaneously cutting off supply lines between the area and Tanggu. When US reinforcements from Tanggu arrived at Xinhe Village, they nearly encountered disaster. The US troops stationed in Tanggu consist of the First Battalion of the First Marine Division, numbering one thousand men.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] According to an official US Navy announcement, on the morning of the 5th, US Marines near Tanggu repelled an attack by an unspecified number of "rioters." The "rioters" infiltrated the area after midnight and attacked the guards at the US armory. The attackers' objective was clearly to seize hand grenades and other munitions. The initial message from Marine Corps headquarters did not reveal whether the attackers succeeded in seizing any munitions. A later message stated that the Marines were pursuing the attackers northward. Tanggu is located in the Gulf of Zhili, a few miles from Tianjin, and is used by the US military as a major port of entry for North China. Since the US Marines landed in North China in October 1945, they have used it as a port for receiving supplies and personnel, and have established an armory there to supply US forces. Around this armory, US Marine guards have constantly clashed with troops of unknown affiliation, but most of the incidents are believed to be attempted thefts. On October 3rd and 4th of last year, a hostile force attacked the First Marine Division's munitions supply depot in the Tanggu area. In that incident, one Marine was slightly wounded, one Chinese was killed, and another Chinese was wounded. The wounded Chinese, who was captured, told US investigators that the purpose of the attack was to obtain munitions for a Communist brigade stationed near Tanggu. Today's attack resulted in a higher casualty rate for the US Marines than the "Anping Incident" in July of last year, in which Communist forces ambushed a convoy of trucks transporting supplies from Tianjin to the Beiping headquarters of the Military Mediation Team, killing four US soldiers and wounding eleven. The armory attacked near Tanggu is located on the edge of a Communist-controlled area. Recent reports have mentioned a Communist scissor-shaped military operation from east to west, aimed at cutting off the 100-mile railroad line between Tianjin and Tangshan controlled by the Nationalists. Amid the escalating conflict in the area, the US armory is a valuable prize for both sides. According to well-informed sources, the Communist 59th Brigade has recently been very active near the Tanggu area. The abduction of a US Marine last year was also attributed to this unit.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 5th] Six hundred Nationalist soldiers from the Second Army were dispatched to Tanggu on the 5th to assist the US military in dealing with the Communist forces. It is claimed that the Communist forces attacked the US armory near Tanggu on the morning of the 5th, resulting in one hundred casualties. During the fierce fighting, two light tanks were dispatched as reinforcements, but they were unable to reach the combat zone due to exploding landmines along the way. By the time the Nationalist troops arrived, the Communist forces had already retreated. According to military authorities, documents found on the bodies of the deceased proved that they belonged to the Communist forces, and the purpose of the attack was clearly to loot munitions. If any were looted, the number would likely be small.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 5th] The US armory five miles from Tanggu was attacked by rioters at 1:15 AM on the 5th. US troops stationed there engaged in a fierce battle for four hours and fifteen minutes. In addition to casualties, one US tank was destroyed by a landmine. During the fighting, several explosions occurred inside the depot. US fighter planes arrived on the scene, but the rioters had already retreated and did not participate in the battle. The wounded US soldiers have been flown to Tianjin for treatment, but six of them are not expected to survive. This is the second time in six months that the US armory has been attacked by Communist forces. The first attack occurred on October 10th of last year, when approximately 200 Communist troops looted some munitions and wounded one US soldier. The Communist forces left behind several bodies. Currently, there are still 8,000 to 10,000 US troops stationed in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. According to an announcement by US military authorities on the 5th, the US troop withdrawal plan will not be changed.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The Navy Department in Washington stated on the 5th that it had not yet received a direct, official report of the attack on the US armory in Tanggu, in which five US soldiers were killed and sixteen wounded. The reason for the delay in receiving the report is due to slow communication.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] According to broadcast news received here, the US supply depot near Tanggu was attacked, and five US Marines were killed. However, the news arrived too late to be included in the first edition of the morning newspapers on the 5th.</p>

<h3>Government Reorganization to Be Realized Soon; Candidates for Government Committee Positions Confirmed by All Parties; List to Be Announced After Chairman Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Zhang Junmai of the China Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th to submit the Democratic Socialist Party's list of candidates for the Government Committee to the government. The Youth Party's list of candidates for the Government Committee was finalized in Shanghai on the 5th and is also expected to be submitted to the government on the 6th. Zeng Qi sent a telegram to Nanjing on the 5th, and Zuo Shunsheng informed him that the decision was being made. Zuo told reporters that the final decision could be made tonight. It is understood that the four Youth Party members of the National Government Committee have been decided as Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, He Luzhi, and Chen Qitian. In addition, the candidates for the National Government Committee from among social leaders will be nominated by the Chairman. According to reliable sources, the list includes Mo Dehui, Chen Huide (Guangfu), Wang _, and Hu Shi (however, Hu stated that he was unwilling to take the position due to the busy affairs of Peking University, but the Chairman insisted on inviting him and asked him to concurrently serve as the president of Peking University. If Hu firmly declines, Bu Congen will be appointed). From the above, it can be seen that the reorganization of the government is only waiting for the Chairman to return to Nanjing to announce it, and then it can be completed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Lei _ told reporters: There is no problem with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, but it still needs a final high-level discussion after the Chairman returns to Nanjing before it can be announced. Generally speaking, the announcement of the National Government Committee will be made first, and then the announcement of the Executive Yuan will follow. Lei also said: Regarding the issue of various parties participating in local governments, the government welcomes it in principle.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] There was no contact between the Youth Party and the government today. The all-day talks on the 4th had reached a concrete stage. Zuo Shunsheng met with reporters tonight and said that he had discussed the reorganization of the government and local governments in detail with Zhang Qun, and had submitted concrete measures, including the regions and candidates, etc. However, the National Government Committee must first be reorganized and established before the next step can be taken.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the Youth Party is very eager for local government positions and has submitted a specific list to the government, including the names of county magistrates and commissioners in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian provinces, and the municipalities of Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. This point is still subject to negotiation between the two parties.</p>
<h3>President Sun Yat-sen's Remarks in Shanghai: Government Reorganization is Indeed to Implement Multi-Party Tutelage, and Then Reach the Stage of Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>[Local News] Yesterday, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan was surrounded by reporters at the Youth League Garden Party, who asked him about various issues such as the government reorganization and the demands of professional organizations to increase the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators. Sun was unwilling to express his opinion on the government reorganization, and said with a smile: "This must be asked of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and the people responsible for the government negotiations." A reporter told him that today's editorial in the Youth Party's newspaper, the China Times, expressed that Sun's statement that "the reorganization of the government is to change from one-party tutelage to multi-party tutelage" was a view held by the Kuomintang and that the Youth Party could not agree with it. Sun then repeated his explanation, saying: "The party-state government must be directly elected by the people. The people who participate in the government by various parties this time are all generated from within each party, and have not gone through the process of popular election, so of course it cannot be called constitutional government. And before the Constitution is officially implemented on December 25th of this year, the provisional constitution during the tutelage period is still valid, because the country must not be without law at any time. Therefore, today's reorganization of the government is indeed to change from one-party tutelage to multi-party tutelage, and then reach the stage of democratic constitutionalism." Regarding the issue of professional organizations demanding an increase in the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators, Sun believed that the National Assembly Representatives Election and Recall Law and the Legislators Election and Recall Law had been formally passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and it was difficult to change them. The reporter then asked: "Professional organizations across the country have jointly petitioned the government authorities, requesting that the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators from professional organizations be re-deliberated, and at least increased to 36 percent. What is your opinion on this?" Sun replied: "I have no opinion, but the issue of increasing the number must be decided by the new government after the reorganization," and so on.</p>
<h3>Kailuan Mines Actively Increases Production; Monthly Output Can Reach 350,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Kailuan Coal Mines is actively increasing production. This month, it is estimated that production can increase from 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons.

The price of Kailuan coal in the area was also adjusted in March, with lump coal increasing to 255,000 yuan per ton. Kailuan has reserves of over 350 million tons of bituminous coal. Before the war, it was a Sino-British joint venture and the largest mine in the country. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, most of the coal produced was transported to Japanese "Manchuria." The equipment was not destroyed after the victory.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The US government has authorized MacArthur to handle the distribution of Japanese reparations materials and decided to allocate 50% (15% of the total amount) of the first batch of reparations materials to China. The Chinese government has not yet received a formal notice, but the preparatory work of the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee has long been completed. According to a person in charge of the committee, the amount of these 15% of materials will reach 1.35 million tons. China has decided to dismantle and transport them back to the country in two batches, using China's existing ships and 16 ships from Japanese reparations materials as transportation tools. As for transportation personnel, the Ministry of Transportation, the Resources Committee, private factories, and various provinces will send personnel to supervise and transport them. The estimated transportation cost is approximately 800 million yuan.

The amount of funds allocated to each district is as follows: Subei District, 6 counties, 300 million yuan; Shandong Military District, 14 counties, 700 million yuan; Southwestern Shandong District, 10 counties, 500 million yuan; Henan District, 23 counties, 1.15 billion yuan; Hubei District, 19 counties, 950 million yuan; Southern Hebei District, 3 counties, 150 million yuan; Central Eastern Hebei District, 11 counties, 550 million yuan; Rehe District, 4 counties, 200 million yuan; Chahar District, 3 counties, 150 million yuan; Suiyuan District, 1 county, 50 million yuan; Northern Shanxi District, 5 counties, 250 million yuan; Southern Shanxi District, 9 counties, 450 million yuan. In the above figures, each district is allocated relief funds for three additional counties, with a reserve of 150 million yuan, in order to coordinate with military progress and carry out emergency relief at any time. These relief funds are designated for the emergency relief of refugees in the pacification areas. As for general emergency relief work in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Social Affairs has requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 1 to 1.5 billion yuan to each province to handle other relief efforts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 5th] The six counties of Qingyang, Zhenning, Zhenyuan, Cha, Huan, and Taishui in eastern Gansu have long been occupied by the Communist army, and the people are living in misery.

<h3>Wang Maogong Inspects Southern Jiangsu; To Inspect Fengxian Today Before Returning to Zhenjiang; Says Security in All Counties is No Longer a Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong has been inspecting various counties in southern Jiangsu for several days. It is now scheduled to inspect Fengxian today and then take the night train back to Zhenjiang. Before leaving, he told reporters that there were no bandits in the territory of the counties in southern Jiangsu, and the security situation was no longer a concern. However, local finances are still difficult. The central task this year is to eliminate the remnants of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu. Fifteen counties in northern Jiangsu have been completely cleared, and more than ten counties are still waiting to be cleared. The remnants of the bandits occupying northern Jiangsu number more than 30,000. The main force in the suppression is the Nationalist army, supplemented by local defense forces, who are clearing the areas separately. In the past, the civilian armed forces in northern Jiangsu were very strong, with one county owning more than 50,000 or 60,000 civilian guns. However, since the Communist army occupied it, all the guns hidden by the civilians were confiscated. Now the provincial government is actively cultivating civilian defense forces. Each county has 3,000 to 4,000 guns, and some have more than 1,000 guns. The civilian self-defense team has more than 30,000 people. The restoration of security in northern Jiangsu is very important to southern Jiangsu, because if the strength of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu is not eliminated, the Yangtze River, which is thousands of miles long, cannot be defended, and there will be no peaceful days in southern Jiangsu. It is hoped that the order in northern Jiangsu can be completely restored before the green gauze tents rise this year. Wang also said that although disputes between farmers and tenants in northern Jiangsu are inevitable, they are not as serious as rumored. The land in northern Jiangsu is barren, and owning dozens of acres of land is not enough to solve the livelihood of a family. Therefore, the Communist Party's land distribution policy has proven to be a failure. Moreover, the purpose of their land distribution is to collect military food. At the highest, one acre of land is levied up to eight bushels. Therefore, under heavy levies, the people are miserable. As for the repatriation of refugees after the recovery of northern Jiangsu, the provincial government and the Executive Yuan's Jiangsu-Nanjing branch provide free transportation and accommodation along the way. After arriving at the destination, they are uniformly rescued by the central government. Everything is going smoothly. At present, there are many people who are still stranded in other places because the villages are still occupied by bandits and they do not want to return to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture Forbids Cutting Down Mulberry Trees</h3>
<p>Circular Issued to Construction Departments of Nine Provinces Including Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a circular to the construction departments of nine provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, instructing them to order all silkworm-raising cities and counties to make clear and strictly prohibit the cutting down of mulberry trees. It is not allowed to cut them down arbitrarily due to temporary price changes and sell them as firewood, because China is based on agriculture, and sericulture is a profitable sideline for farmers. Since ancient times, agriculture and sericulture have been equally important.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Garrison District's Military Service Affairs: Draft Surveys Nearing Completion, Exemption and Postponement Reviews Begin; Family Allowance at Least 150,000 Yuan Per Man Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 5th] The Suzhou Garrison District Headquarters invited representatives from the Shanghai and Suzhou press on the 5th to hold a meeting regarding recent work. Commander She Xu provided a detailed account of the military service steps. A summary is as follows: The initial step in implementing the Military Service Law is a background investigation, which includes all people between the ages of 19 and 45. Changshu and Wujiang counties have already completed this, and Suzhou is expected to complete it by April 15th. Next is the review of exemptions and postponements. Currently, Changshu and Wujiang counties have begun processing these, using a method that involves convening a Baojia assembly to gather opinions, which are then submitted for approval. The scope of application, in addition to what is already stipulated in the Military Service Law, has been supplemented by repeated orders from the Ministry of National Defense as follows: (1) Employees of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of China, as well as employees of other banks with similar natures, and active-duty men of draft age in various government agencies, who have graduated from senior high school or above and obtained a military training certificate, may have their conscription postponed. (2) Medical personnel with the same qualifications as the previous article, or who have served in military agencies for more than one year during the Anti-Japanese War and have official documentation from the Army Medical Administration, may have their conscription postponed. (3) Students of nursing, midwifery, and pharmacy schools who have not yet graduated may have their conscription postponed. (4) Traffic police performing pacification and defense duties may have their conscription postponed. (5) Those who have graduated from teacher training schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and are currently serving as primary school teachers for more than one year may have their call-up postponed. (6) Those with illnesses that prove they are unfit for combat duties may have their call-up postponed. (7) Only sons who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families, or whose brothers have all already been conscripted, or who are under the age of eighteen, may have their call-up postponed. (8) Those who have committed the most serious crimes, such as imprisonment for a definite term or more, and are still under prosecution or serving their sentences, may have their call-up postponed. (9) Specialized technical employees of the China Textile Industries Corporation may have their call-up postponed. In summary, it can be seen that the scope of postponement is extremely broad, and the conscription quota accounts for only one in a thousand of the total population, and no more than one in eight in terms of conscription years. Therefore, the chances of people serving in the military are extremely small. The fear in today's society is purely a mistake in awareness and unnecessary worry. According to recent statistics, the total population of Suzhou, Yuxian, and Wu counties is over 1,512,000, of which over 463,000 are men of draft age. However, the exact number of formal conscripts and the years of conscription will be determined after the entire background investigation is completed. What is gratifying is that the preferential treatment for conscript families has been concretely defined. In the future, the family allowance for each conscript will be at least 150,000 yuan per month. In terms of the conscription method, efforts will be made to ensure fairness and eliminate abuses. The drawing of lots will be done by county, or draft-age men can draw lots themselves. If any case of hiring substitutes is discovered, the perpetrators will be punished according to the Military Service Law with the death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>China's Land Reform Movement in the Last Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zheng</p>
<p>Written for the annual meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese Land Administration Society in the 21st year of the Republic of China, China's land reform movement has had a new appeal and a new struggle. Although the difficult national destiny of the past fifteen years has prevented the land reform movement from achieving brilliant development and results, it has at least made the efforts that should be made. In the past fifteen years, the achievements of the Chinese Land Administration Society can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Constitutional Movement: The provisions on land matters in the National Economic Chapter of the Fifth and Fifth Constitution were formulated entirely by adopting the repeated suggestions of the Chinese Land Administration Society. The society's suggestions were based on the conclusions of two Constitutional Draft Research Conferences, which were sent to the Legislative Yuan in June and October of the 21st year to be included in the Fifth and Fifth Constitutional Draft. The New Constitution was promulgated on December 25th of last year, and all the society's proposals have been adopted.</p>
<p>(2) The Movement to Amend the Land Law: After the Land Problem Discussion Conference formulated ten principles, the Chinese Land Administration Society continued to study how to amend the Land Law and promote its realization. In August of the 23rd year, the Land Committee officially entrusted the society to study four relevant land problem proposals submitted by the Central Political Committee, which was the official start of the movement to amend the Land Law. The Land Law Research Conference was convened in October, and a written opinion was submitted in November. Finally, in October of the 25th year, the Central Land Special Committee proposed 24 principles for amending the Land Law. After three meetings of the Central Political Committee, the items were discussed one by one, and 22 items were officially passed on May 5th of the 26th year. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan submitted its opinions on each item, and especially opposed the progressive tax system on land value reserved by the Central Political Committee, and debated with the society back and forth. Until April 29th of the 35th year, the National Government promulgated the amended Land Law, officially stipulating that land value tax should be levied according to the legally stipulated land value at progressive tax rates.</p>
<p>(3) The Land Registration Movement: Land consolidation is not only the forerunner of implementing land policy, but also a way to increase financial revenue. The Chinese Land Administration Society advocates fundamental consolidation using scientific methods, which has been adopted by the society's member organizations. Until the Anti-Japanese War, the land registration work of various provinces was progressing rapidly. Most of the society's members participated in this work. When the central government formulated a five-year plan in the 26th year, it also planned to complete the national surveying and registration in three phases. The Anti-Japanese War suddenly dealt a major blow to the land registration movement. However, after the capital was moved to the west, the southwestern and northwestern provinces continued the legacy of this movement and gradually advanced their work in difficult circumstances. Now that the reconstruction has begun, members in various places are actively engaged in promoting land registration.</p>
<p>(4) The Rent and Tenancy Reform Movement: The rent and tenancy system has a long history and deep-seated abuses in our country. The Chinese Land Administration Society has always had the most thorough and ideal proposals for this. It was initially planned to be trialed in Qidong, Jiangsu, and then planned to be realized in northern Shaanxi. However, it failed to be implemented due to the lack of strong belief and promotion power of the local government. However, until November of last year, the "Land Disposal Measures for the Pacification Area" were passed and implemented, clearly stipulating the protection of rent and tenancy and limiting rent to one-third of normal produce, and that tenant farmers have the right to obtain land with priority has proved that the society's proposals can win the warm support of farmers and the general social evaluation. The drafting of regulations and the determination of steps will gradually mature. The thorough reform of the rent and tenancy system and the adjustment of land distribution are of the same vein. The development of this movement is in full swing.</p>
<p>(5) The Wartime Reclamation and Soldiers' Land Grant Movement: Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Land Administration Society had already paid attention to the migration and reclamation of the southwest and northwest. Investigations and planning have been carried out successively regarding the wasteland reclamation and farmland utilization improvement in various regions. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the society first proposed a wartime land policy to promote wartime reclamation and soldiers' land grant movement, in order to promote national attention. It also suggested implementation plans to the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations. Eventually, due to the needs of the times, the establishment of public and private reclamation areas sprang up like mushrooms after the rain. The establishment of the Central Reclamation General Bureau in the 29th year can be regarded as clear evidence that the wartime and postwar reclamation movements will be promoted sharply. In addition, the wartime land policy outline at the beginning of the wartime grain requisition policy was the society's suggestion, which was adopted and implemented by the highest authorities.</p>
<p>(6) The Movement to Establish a Land Finance System and a Land Administration System: The completeness of the land finance system and the land administration system is the wing of promoting land policy. The Chinese Land Administration Society has repeatedly expressed the necessity of establishing a complete and systematic land bank and land administration agency, and has made many direct and indirect efforts to promote them, which has gradually completed the regulations and the gradual establishment of land administration agencies in provinces and counties. In July of the 29th year, the Central Seventh Plenary Session resolved to establish the China Land Bank, and in June of the 30th year, the China Farmers Bank temporarily established a land finance department to manage the matter, so the land finance system is also gradually taking shape. Although it is still a long way from the society's ideal, with correct proposals and continued struggle, it will be able to see success in the future.</p>
<p>(7) The Farmland Reform Movement: At the beginning of the establishment of the society, it focused on the promotion of farmland reform as the center of all movements. Before the war, it launched an experimental county movement to first realize the society's proposals in a small range as a demonstration for the whole. Therefore, Pinghu in Zhejiang, Lianxian in Guangdong, Suide in Shaanxi, and Linan in Hubei all appeared as land administration experimental counties one after another, but they did not achieve success due to war or political situation. The more satisfactory ones are Kaiyan in Fujian and the Huanghui Canal area in Gansu and the Beibei District of the capital are the initial stages of the implementation of the standard self-cultivating farmer system. In August of the 35th year, in view of the evolution of the situation, which has reached the point where actual land reform actions should be taken, the society suggested to the highest authorities to implement farmland reform as the center of economic reform and proposed an outline for the implementation of a five-year economic construction plan, which was approved by the National Defense Council and will soon be implemented.</p>
<p>(8) Establishment of the Chinese Land Administration Research Institute and the Jian Guo College of Law and Commerce: The research work of the Chinese Land Administration Society used to be carried out in cooperation with the Land Administration College of the Central Political School. After the reorganization of the Political School and the closure of the Land Administration College, the society decided to establish a Land Administration Research Institute in view of the fact that research could not be suspended. Preparations began in the 29th year and were officially established in December of the same year. It was also approved by the Ministry of Education to recruit graduate students every year from the summer vacation of the 31st year. In the spring of the 35th year, the Land Administration Research Institute returned to the capital from Chongqing. In order to cultivate talents for national construction, it expanded and established the Jian Guo College of Law and Commerce, with five departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Accounting and Banking.</p>
<p>(9) Publishing "Land Administration Monthly" and "Man and Land" Semimonthly and Various Series of Books and Journals: The society's propaganda products previously included two types: Land Administration Monthly and Land Administration Weekly, both of which were suspended due to the war. In the spring of the 30th year, the "Man and Land" Semimonthly was published, responsible for continuing to promote land reform. In April of the 34th year, it was changed to the Land Administration Journal (Quarterly) edited and printed by the Land Administration Research Institute as a forum for deeper research, and 16 series of books and more than 30 professional journals were published successively. The society's local branches have also compiled various publications for publicity.</p>
<p>The national construction movement has actually begun, and the society's responsibility is even greater.

<h3>Adjustment Committee Meeting Lasts Eight Hours; German Political Issues Still Deadlocked; Definition of German Assets in Austria Also Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 4th] The Adjustment Committee held a meeting at 11:30 this morning, lasting for eight hours continuously until it adjourned at 8:00 in the evening. The opinions of the four-nation delegations on the issue of the temporary political organization of Germany are still as divergent as before. Only one resolution was reached, namely to continue the meeting tomorrow morning. The meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries was originally scheduled for 6:00 pm today, but was postponed until tomorrow due to the Adjustment Committee's deadlock. The three issues discussed by the Adjustment Committee today were: (1) The establishment of a central administrative agency to exercise the powers of the Ministry of Economy. The French representative insisted that Germans should not serve as ministers or cabinet members, but agreed to distinguish between important administrative agencies and secondary administrative agencies, with only the latter being entrusted to German management; (2) The tasks and composition of the German Advisory Committee (attached to the Allied Control Council); (3) The issue of a temporary constitution for Germany. In addition, the foreign ministers of the four countries also held a meeting today to discuss the issue of German assets in Austria, chaired by the Soviet representative Gusev, and immediately decided to request the Economic Committee to submit a report on this issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 4th] The representatives of the foreign ministers on Austrian issues continued to discuss the definition of German assets in Austria today, but no results were achieved. On the contrary, the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States became more acute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] It is reported that: In order to ensure the continuation of the meeting, Marshall will propose next week to place the Ruhr region, the industrial heart of Germany, and the agricultural and industrial area of Silesia, which is now in Polish hands, under the supervision and management of the United Nations. According to reports, the Soviet Union had previously advocated that the Ruhr region be jointly managed by the four powers, while Poland has always demanded to acquire Silesia and has the support of the Soviet Union for its demand. Marshall's intention now is to consider the interests of the entire Europe, so he intends to advocate that the two places be managed by the United Nations. Before the adjournment of the Adjustment Committee, the British representative Robertson suggested that the four powers should first determine the following points: (1) Whether the German people have a single nationality, or whether their place of origin should be determined by the state in which they reside; (2) Whether the German states are independent of each other and have the right to establish diplomatic relations and sign treaties separately; (3) Whether the central government can be directly elected by the people to obtain governing power or represent the governments of various states.</p>
<h3>Compensation Issues Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, May 5] According to reliable sources today, the Foreign Ministers' meeting is deadlocked on the issue of German reparations. The Economic Committee has abandoned its search for a compromise solution and has ceased meeting to discuss it. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reportedly stated that he does not believe President Truman's aid plan for Greece can restore democracy in that country. Molotov demanded non-interference in Greece. Other German issues are centered on the issue of reparations. Since the reparations issue cannot be resolved, hopes are slim for any achievements at this session of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The United States and Britain may have to resort to a secondary plan, perhaps attempting to win over France, merging the French occupation zone economically with the American and British zones.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, May 4, United Press] Western countries today hoped that Molotov would compromise on the German reparations dispute, to align with Marshall's conciliatory gesture of accepting that German reparations could be paid from Germany's current production. Marshall's move is, at the very least, a strategy aimed at breaking the major deadlock in the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The next step should be taken by the Soviet Union. The Soviet side has rejected Marshall's proposal, considering it unsatisfactory, and has not yet made any move towards compromise. Marshall's proposal is far from the Soviet demand for $10 billion in reparations.</p>
<h3>McNarney Explains Current Situation in Germany</h3>
<p>Accuses Soviet Military Authorities of Actions</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, May 4] Former U.S. Commander of Occupation Forces in Europe, General McNarney, stated today that if the four Foreign Ministers cannot reach an agreement on Germany, then western Germany may form another separate nation, including the current occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France. However, while this is possible, it is not yet being discussed. McNarney criticized the actions of the Soviet authorities in Germany, stating they are entirely based on the intention of spreading communist ideology throughout the world. However, communism has little hope of penetrating the American occupation zone; residents in the recent elections elected fewer than ten percent communists. McNarney also stated that the U.S. forces in Germany are not organized for tactical purposes and are insufficient to resist any strong nation's invasion. The Soviet occupation forces number as many as 450,000, equal to the total number of occupation forces of Britain, the United States, and France combined.</p>

<h3>U.S. Should Take Responsibility for Preventing Soviet Expansion of Power, Senator George Declares in Senate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, May 4] The Senate today approved President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. Senator George declared that the United States must take action now, or the Soviet Union will sweep across Europe. It is our responsibility to prevent the expansion of Soviet power. If it is not stopped, Soviet power will inevitably sweep across Europe, extending into Asia and South America, without end. There is now evidence indicating that Soviet power has invaded India. George continued, saying that the Soviet Union controls the Balkan countries in the West, and maintains strongholds in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, and also effectively maintains power in the three eastern provinces of China and Korea.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, May 4] State Department Middle East Director Henderson recently declared to the Foreign Affairs Committee here that the U.S. aid plan to Greece and Turkey will not only not cause war, but will strengthen the foundation of peace. Greece has a democratic system and is fighting for democracy, even communists who ignore Greek independence have the right to publish newspapers. The parliamentary opposition can also criticize the government, but this is not the case in northern Greece. Regarding the Turkish issue, the United States is willing to cooperate with all countries within the United Nations framework.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, May 4] Moscow Radio broadcast today that an Athens conservative newspaper carried a report from Cairo stating that the United States plans to establish naval and air bases on the Greek island of Lemnos, but did not elaborate.

<h3>Investigation Team Should Remain in Greece</h3>

The ambassador is scheduled to return home on the 6th, but it will be postponed due to transportation difficulties.</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliament to Hold By-elections, Democratic Party to Boycott</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, May 4] The Turkish Democratic Party has decided not to participate in the partial by-elections to be held in parliament on the 6th of this month, so a new crisis has occurred in Turkey's internal political situation. The main dispute between the Democratic Party and the ruling Republican People's Party is the election law. The Democratic Party believes that the election law gives the government excessive power to control elections. According to observers here, the intention of the Democratic Party is to seek new general elections, but because the government believes that the partial by-elections are legal and the current election law is quite fair, the chances of general elections are very slim. Since the elections in June of last year, the Democratic Party has continuously demanded amendments to the election law. At its national conference in February of this year, the party decided that its members in parliament (about sixty in total) would withdraw from parliament. The Democratic Party's decision to boycott the partial by-elections on the 6th of this month will, in effect, restore one-party rule in Turkey.</p>

<h3>Italian Economic Situation Serious, Prime Minister Urges U.S. to Provide Assistance Quickly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, May 4] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi hosted a press conference today, issuing a warning that Italy cannot overcome the current difficulties without foreign aid. If the economic crisis deepens to the point of being uncontrollable, then the only option is to implement dictatorship. As De Gasperi spoke, the labor unrest in Naples gradually became widespread. Rome postal workers protested over high living costs, and national telecommunications were also paralyzed. Police in Scisciano clashed with unemployed workers, and eleven people were injured, including four police officers. While speaking, De Gasperi pounded the table to emphasize that the government will take all measures to implement the fourteen new plans to prevent inflation. If the people cannot agree among themselves, then dictatorship may be inevitable, but De Gasperi did not specify whether it would be a right-wing or left-wing dictatorship. De Gasperi expressed incomprehension at the U.S. Congress's delay in passing U.S. aid to Italy after the UNRRA ended, but hoped that the U.S. proposal to aid Greece and Turkey would not reduce its aid to Italy.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, May 5] Well-informed sources predict that the Indian issue will take a sudden turn at any time, including the possibility of Britain and India forming a defense alliance. Once the new Viceroy of India, Mountbatten, completes the current stage of talks with the leaders of the Congress Party and the Muslim League, Britain will discuss various ways to break the current impasse. It is heard that the Congress Party has made the following three demands: (1) Britain immediately grants the Indian interim government all the powers enjoyed by a dominion government, without any restrictions; (2) Before the constitution is adopted, the Indian interim government should be responsible to the Constituent Assembly, and the Constituent Assembly should be the interim legislative body; (3) The British Governor-General of India can only become the head of the Indian state constitutionally. If the above proposals are accepted, India is willing to negotiate a treaty of defense alliance with Britain.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, May 4] U.S. Military Governor of South Korea, Major General Lerch, announced today that Koreans will assume greater responsibility in the U.S. occupation zone to handle their own affairs. From now on, U.S. control will only be used to prevent political crises. For less important events, the U.S. does not want to impose U.S. opinions or methods on Koreans. The future policy of the military government, with a few exceptions, is that U.S. personnel will withdraw from practical work and only monitor from the sidelines in various provinces and departments, in order to make suggestions and correct errors. The purpose of the military government is to build a free, independent, united and unified Korea, governed by Koreans, and to revive Korea in economic, educational and cultural aspects. If only the second purpose is to be achieved, it will be quite easy. Experienced Americans can manage Korean industry, and with the assistance of American experts and American capital, Korea can be revived in a short period of time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] In the case of Ma Wenlin, a traitor who was previously sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the High Court, someone suddenly submitted a secret letter of accusation to the High Prosecutor's Office, stating that Ma Wenlin had solicited favors and there were suspicious clues in the letter, involving Wang Jian'e, the current district chief of the Xincheng District, who used to practice law; lawyers Chen Xingmin and Xu Ying; and Shi Jiutang, who used to practice law in the past. The reporter visited Wang Jian'e, the district chief of the Xincheng District, about this matter. According to him, "The High Prosecutor's Office sent an official letter asking me to go there for a talk at 9:00 AM on the 31st of last month. When I went to the office, Prosecutor Ye Yushao talked to me in the reception room. Prosecutor Ye asked me if I had accepted Ma Wenlin's entrustment. I immediately told him that since I took office as district chief, I could not practice law at the same time and had not accepted entrustments for litigation for a long time. I did not know Ma Wenlin, so it was very strange. The content of the conversation was very simple and the time was very short. It is rumored that the High Prosecutor's Office held a court hearing to investigate, which is not in line with the facts."</p>

<h3>Sino-US North Route Airline: Destination Extended to Washington</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to open the Sino-US North Pacific air route, Northwest Airlines of the United States decided to send a plane to Shanghai two months ago to inspect the route and collect flight information in preparation for officially opening the Sino-US North Route airline this summer. According to the person in charge of the Northwest Airlines office in Shanghai, the company has submitted a request to the US Civil Aeronautics Board to allow the company's passenger planes to land in Washington, DC, so that passengers flying from Shanghai to the United States can directly reach Washington, DC. The application is being reviewed by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Sino-US North Route airline planned by Northwest Airlines will start from Tokyo, pass through Shanghai, Manila, and other places, cross Alaska, and reach Washington, DC, taking two days for the entire journey. The company also plans to use express supersonic aircraft on the route starting next year, reducing the Sino-US journey to one day.</p>

<h3>Former Residence of Mitsui: Short-Lived Cherry Blossoms: Youth League Invites All Circles to Appreciate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The cherry blossoms in the garden of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League on Zhongzheng South First Road (Father Kim Road) are in full bloom. Wu Shaozhu, director of the league branch, specially invited city councilors, local leaders, and celebrities from all walks of life to the garden from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM yesterday to enjoy the flowers and tour the garden. About 500 people attended, including Sun Ke, Li Shizeng, Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, and others. Director Wu, Zhao Yangxiong, director of the league's general affairs department, and Cao Jun, secretary-general, warmly welcomed the guests. At the same time, Senator Zhang Zhongyuan invited many well-known painters from the city to paint under the cherry trees and jointly create a painting of "A Hundred Flowers Offering Auspiciousness" as a souvenir. The New Motion Broadcasting Company broadcasted a special program from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM to welcome the guests.</p>
<p>According to Zhao Yangxiong, director of the league's general affairs department, this garden was originally the residence of the general manager of the Japanese Mitsui Foreign Firm. It covers an area of thirty acres and has a history of thirty years. There are more than 200 cherry trees in the entire garden, all transplanted from Japan. They were designed and arranged by horticultural experts, so when viewed from the ground, each tree stands separately, but when viewed from the roof or a high place, it is a sea of pink, which is beautiful beyond words. Unfortunately, the lifespan of cherry blossoms is very short, only one week from blooming to withering, and they disappear with a rain. Even on a sunny day, they will wither in two or three days. When the reporter visited yesterday, he saw cherry blossoms swaying in the wind and sprinkling on the green grass.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Replies to User Inquiries</h3>
<p>Dear Sir: We are sending you a copy of this bureau's public reply to telephone users' inquiries. Please review it and publish it in the social services column of Shen Bao. Sincerely, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>To a User Who Cares About This Bureau: Your letter of March 19 has been received. The public replies to the suggestions for improving the telephone are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The "02" platform is installed by the American Shanghai Telephone Company. When users of that company need to call users of this bureau's Nanshi and Zhabei platforms, they must be transferred by the "02" platform operators. These operators are employed by that company and are not under the jurisdiction of this bureau. However, since there are misconnections as indicated in the letter, this bureau has notified the responsible personnel of that company to correct them. (2) The telephone number for the repair platform of this bureau is 101 or 112. The technicians who measure the machine value have been strictly instructed to use peaceful and sincere wording when accepting users' requests for repair obstacles. If there is indeed any rude or perfunctory behavior, users can record the date and time and report it to this bureau, and we will investigate it.</p>
<p>(3) The types of long-distance calls include calling, calling a person, and paging. The calculation of the call time for a calling number starts from the time when the designated called telephone number and the calling user start talking. If, after the connection, waiting time is required to find someone else to answer the call, the intermediate waiting time is included in the calculation. Calling a person starts from the time when the designated recipient or the designated extension or a certain part of the designated store or agency speaks to the recipient. The recording time of this bureau's long-distance platform follows the above regulations. As for the operators, they are never allowed to leave their seats without authorization. The inaccurate recording of call times indicated in the letter may be due to the user not knowing the type of call or wasting time. In the future, when users call long distance, please analyze whether it is calling a number or calling a person according to their needs and notify the long-distance telephone recording platform to register in order to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>(4) The various fees of this bureau are handled in accordance with laws and regulations. The amount of long-distance prepaid fees is also collected in accordance with regulations, but recently we have been ordered to reduce it to 50,000 yuan per household. Sincerely.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Designates Six Normal Schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Study the Teaching Process of Teachers' Affairs and Orders Normal School Teachers in Twenty-Three Provinces and Cities to Engage in Academic Research</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education believes that normal schools are the source of cultivating national teachers and are closely related to basic education. All facilities of normal schools are very important, and the teaching process of each subject should be studied and improved. The Ministry of Education recently designated six schools, including Nanjing Municipal Normal School, Jiangsu Provincial Jiangmi Normal School, Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, Xinlu Normal School, Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School, and Hangzhou Normal School, to earnestly study the teaching process of normal schools and awarded each school a research grant of one million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] In order to encourage normal schools to engage in academic research, the Ministry of Education designated 23 provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Xikang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Hebei, Henan, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Taiwan, Chongqing, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as the four normal schools, including the National First and Second Overseas Chinese, Chengdu, and Longdong, to select excellent teachers to engage in academic research. It stipulates that the research grant for each topic is 50,000 yuan. The research topic is self-determined by each researcher, and the research scope is mainly to enhance the professional knowledge and skills related to the teaching of the subject being taught. The research personnel are limited to those who have passed the qualification examination and have continued to serve as full-time teachers in normal schools for more than five years and have achieved results. Application forms and project proposals for each researcher must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review before the end of this month. If any special value is found after the review, additional awards will be given.</p>
<h3>Ancient University Professors Plan to Improve Teacher Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beigu, 5th] The Normal Education Movement Week, organized by the National Beiping Normal College, has come to a successful conclusion. Yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen professors from the Department of Education of various universities in the city, including Chen Yousong, were invited to discuss "How should normal education in our country be improved in order to meet the needs of nation-building and the trend of the world?" Regarding the system, the professors believed that normal education should be an independent academic system, normal colleges should be renamed normal universities, universities should have education departments, teacher training should have a five-year or ten-year plan, higher normal teachers should produce 54,000 people annually, primary normal teachers should produce 340,000 people annually, and they must be specialized. Education funds should be increased by 15 times for those with higher living standards and 20 times for those with primary living standards. Normal education should have a consistent policy to avoid disconnection and deterioration. Li Jinxiong, dean of academic affairs of Beiping Normal College, proposed "National Normal Universities should be divided into nine districts to establish an independent academic system," which was unanimously approved by the attending professors. The above discussion results were submitted by the Normal College to the Ministry of Education for adoption.</p>
<h3>The Capital's Children's Entertainment World Celebrated Children's Entertainment Festival Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Today is the 5th Music Festival. In the capital's various squares, starting at 10:00 AM, the National Government Orchestra, the Central Training Corps Orchestra, and other thirteen military bands gave public performances. The audience was very crowded and enthusiastic. At 2:00 PM, the music community of Nanjing held a tea party celebration at the Cultural Hall.

<h3>Youth League to Build Chiang Kai-shek Library in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] To commemorate Leader Chiang, the Youth League plans to build the "Chiang Kai-shek Library" in Nanjing. A preparatory committee has been established, appointing Jiang Fucong and nine others as preparatory committee members.</p>
<h3>Publishers Plan to Request Ministry of Education to Provide Standardized Paper and Loans to Mass Produce National Textbook Harm</h3>
<p>Massively Printing National Textbooks Hurts</p>
<p>The methods and detailed rules for printing national textbooks have been successively formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education. A portion of the publishing industry in this city held a special meeting yesterday to discuss the issue. Everyone agreed that after the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, it is still unknown whether the national textbook system will be changed. Moreover, the new curriculum standards will be announced soon. The effective sales time for these old national textbooks is at most one semester this autumn. What will be the way out for the remaining books in the future? This is a major problem. Therefore, many investors are hesitant. In addition, the production cost of each book is very high. Taking the format as an example, it is not convenient to use the format of the Joint Printing Office, which may involve legal disputes. If printers design and typeset on their own, each set will cost more than 200 million yuan, which will inevitably lead to business losses. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Education to centrally produce the plates in the shortest possible time and distribute the finished products free of charge, so that publishers can reduce costs and avoid non-compliance with the prescribed formats. Moreover, since the restriction on paper imports, not only has the price soared, but it is also difficult to purchase. Since the promulgation of the detailed rules for the national textbook printing payment, the price of paper has increased by another 20%. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Education to find a way to allocate cheap paper to cooperate with the textbook price limit policy. It is also planned to request the Ministry of Education to contact the National Bank to arrange loans and provide guarantees, with a loan of 2 billion yuan for every 10,000 reams printed, so that a large number of books can be printed to avoid a book shortage after the copyright is made public.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Students Appeal to Continue Running Navigation and Marine Engineering Departments</h3>
<p>Since their establishment in the Republic of China, the Navigation and Marine Engineering departments of Jiaotong University have been suspended once. They were restored in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), but last summer, the Ministry of Education ordered their suspension again. It is now reported that the students of the university have established a "School Protection Committee" at the departmental representative conference the day before yesterday, launching a school-wide signature campaign to appeal to alumni and the authorities, hoping to continue running the two departments, so that the cultivation of navigation talents will not be interrupted.</p>

<h3>Northeast Soil Research Institute Was Formerly the Continental Science Institute Established by the Japanese; It Has Now Been Reorganized and Temporarily Managed by Changchun University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Twelve years ago, the Japanese established a science museum (Continental Science Institute) in the puppet Manchurian capital, Xinjing, claiming it to be the largest in Asia. After the victory, due to the repeated turmoil in Changchun, the internal damage was extremely severe, with estimated losses of more than 40%. Currently, most of the research work has been suspended. It is now only engaged in the production of a small amount of ergot, using wheat bran and microorganisms to extract drugs specifically for women's blood disorders. This once painstakingly managed economic construction base camp for the development of puppet Manchuria by the Japanese still cannot be used for our prosperity in the Northeast after the recovery. After the National Army recovered Changchun last summer, the institute was managed by the original Chinese staff members dispatched by relevant parties. In June last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over and organized a management committee to rectify the damaged instruments and equipment. On March 1st of this year, it was officially renamed the Northeast Science Research Institute of the Northeast Administrative Office Economic Committee. The Executive Yuan's regular meeting approved the transfer of the institute to the National Changchun University for temporary management. The reorganized Northeast Science Research Institute on March 1st now has a research department and an experimental factory, divided into 23 groups.</p>

<h3>A Respectful Reply to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding National Textbooks (3)</h3>
<p>— Lu Dianyang</p>
<p>Most of the selected authors in the six volumes of junior high school textbooks are contemporary, with no less than one hundred people. There is even an article from the Ta Kung Pao included, and there are many anonymous articles. This shows that there was no prejudice during the selection of articles. As for Deng Guangsen's unique exclusion of Wang Guangqi and Chang Naide, it is also puzzling. Wang Guangqi's accomplishments in children's music are extremely well-known both domestically and internationally. His article "Music and Life" and Feng Zikai's "Art and Life" can be regarded as masterpieces. Chang Naide's "The Failure of the Aggressors" vividly recounts the failure of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, which serves as a lesson for both the present and the future. There seems to be no reason not to select it for reading. Deng Guangsen has already criticized the party-oriented components of the Ministry-compiled textbooks, believing that they exclude other parties and factions, but at the same time, he opposes the selection of articles by non-Kuomintang members such as Wang Guangqi and Chang Naide. If there is no other purpose, it is difficult to conform to logic. According to the notes attached to the curriculum standards, it is certainly appropriate to select speeches and exhortations from the party and the country. However, among the more than 150 articles by various people in the entire book, it can be asserted that the authors who are not affiliated with the Kuomintang must outnumber those who are Kuomintang members. Deng Guangsen's claim of party orientation can be refuted without attack. It is extremely difficult to select works by contemporary people. With a little carelessness, it immediately becomes a label, "recently recorded," which is most inappropriate. However, since junior high school Chinese should mostly select vernacular works, works by contemporary people are inevitable. The selection and exclusion of this book are based on the important principles and negative conditions in the curriculum standards. It is hoped that when domestic scholars criticize textbooks, they will first read the curriculum standards in detail before giving their advice, which will be more appropriate. If there are any deficiencies in the curriculum standards, suggestions for modification can also be made. Currently, the Ministry of Education is separately inviting experts to revise the curriculum standards. It is hoped that they will pay attention to teaching.</p>
<p>(3) There are two points in Mr. Deng's views that the editors dare not agree with. One is Mr. Deng's view of nationalism, which is the most important point in the entire article. Mr. Deng advocates excluding Mongolia and the Qing Dynasty and establishing a Han-centric position, which is a narrow nationalism. In revolutionary propaganda texts, one can speak freely and use the most malicious words to exclude other ethnic groups. For example, during the National Revolution led by the Founding Father, it was fine to use phrases such as "drive out the Tartars and restore China" to motivate the people and overthrow the Qing Dynasty's politics. However, if in today's era when various ethnic groups are integrated into a large Chinese nation, this narrow concept is still emphasized, excluding other ethnic groups, then the consequences are unimaginable. In the past, Japan, and today's great powers, are always stirring up ethnic divisions in other countries to achieve their desire for encroachment. Looking around at the ethnic situation in various border areas of our country, one cannot help but feel chills. If the defense against the barbarians is further emphasized and the history of the Yuan and Qing Dynasties trampling on the Han people is deliberately exaggerated, causing hatred between ethnic groups, then it will precisely hit the strong neighbor's plan of division, and the so-called ethnic self-determination and independence movements will arise soon. The editors deeply agree with the Ta Kung Pao editorial "An Enlightened Policy Should Be Adopted Towards Xinjiang" on January 16th of this year, feeling that it is in line with the editors' aim in compiling junior high school history. The first goal of the Ministry-promulgated junior high school history curriculum standards is: "Narrate the evolution of the Chinese nation, paying special attention to the integration and interdependence of various ethnic groups, to elucidate the historical basis of the unity of the entire nation, and to fully explain the glory in history and the aggression of the great powers in modern times and its causes, to inspire students' will and determination to revitalize the nation." The Ministry-compiled junior high school history textbooks are edited based on this intention. The phrase "taking nationalism as the center" mentioned in the editing guidelines refers to the great Chinese nation, including the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, and other ethnic groups, regardless of barbarian or civilized, which is a broad nationalism. In fact, writing history books should be like this.</p>

<h3>Extra Time Decides the Outcome; Group B Jump Ball Decides the Final Again; Qingbai Fortunate to Defeat Railway; Wind Pure Helps by Sending in a Goal at the End</h3>
<p>The Group B football league championship final rematch, Qingbai vs. Railway, was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. There were about 2,000 spectators. Zhang Le was the referee. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to separate. Railway's offense was frequent, and forwards Zhang Jie, Xiao Ziwen, and Lu Qingxiang had shooting opportunities, but they were all saved by Huang Shijie. Qingbai's counterattacks were also unsuccessful. The score was 0-0 in the first half. After the break, Yu Bai replaced Shan Tongquan with Cai Shengmiao. Railway made no changes. After the contact, the two sides attacked and defended each other, but both lacked a final point. The score was still tied at the end of the match. In extra time, both teams showed signs of fatigue. The stalemate lasted until ten minutes before the end of the match when Qingbai's Li Songyun got the ball and dribbled to the right, lifting his foot and passing it to the front of the goal. Railway goalkeeper Liao Qingxiong did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, due to the wind's assistance, the ball was sent into the net. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Qingbai fortunately defeated Railway by one goal to win the championship. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Preparation of the National Games to Be Determined by Shanghai Itself</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education had previously drafted the regulations for the preparatory committee of the 7th National Games. Now, since the meeting is being held in Shanghai, the regulations must be revised according to the local actual needs, following the precedents of the meetings held in Hangzhou and Shanghai in the past, such as the number of members of the preparatory committee and the increase or decrease of groups. All the revisions in the regulations shall be determined by Shanghai itself and reported to the Ministry for record.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Next Year's World Games to Be Accelerated; British Preparatory Committee Issues Statement; Prime Minister Guarantees Full Government Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] The British government recently banned large-scale sporting events outside of holidays to avoid attracting spectators and hindering production work. This has led to widespread concern that the World Games to be held in London in 1948 may be hindered. A spokesman for the British World Games Preparatory Committee issued a statement today to clarify, saying: Prime Minister Attlee has guaranteed his support for our role as hosts for the World Games. We are now preparing at full speed. The World Games will not be canceled, postponed, or held in another country. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office also said: The government's previous guarantee to sponsor the World Games has not changed, and there are no problems with funding. Wembley Stadium, which provides the sports venue, has allowed the preparatory committee to advance $400,000, which will be repaid from ticket sales in the future.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Island Soccer News: Shanghai Stars' Tour of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] The Shanghai Stars table tennis team visited Hong Kong. On the evening of the 20th, they played their first match at the China Youth Gymnasium against the Eastern team. The audience was exceptionally crowded to watch the match. As a result, the Eastern team fought hard and defeated the visiting team with a score of 13 to 11.</p>
<p>The match adopted international rules, with five players rotating. The first team to win 13 games won. Since the start of the match, the two sides competed fiercely. From 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM, the score was still 11 to 11. It was not until the last game that the Eastern team finally won two points, overwhelming the Shanghai Stars.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Shanghai Stars won 3 to 2. In the second game, the Eastern team won 3 to 2. In the third game, the Shanghai Stars won 3 to 2. In the fourth game, the Eastern team won 3 to 2. In the final game, the Eastern team won again 3 to 1. In this match, Wang Youxin of the Shanghai Stars performed very well and did not encounter any opponents.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 21st, the Shanghai Stars continued to clash with the Confucian Society. In terms of talent, the Confucian Society was indeed better than the Eastern team. However, the Shanghai Stars, feeling the loss of the previous night, used all their strength. Lu Hanjun and Xue Xuchu had already regained their level. Wang Youxin, who had won all the previous night, was defeated by Zhong Zhancheng. With the efforts of all the generals, the Shanghai Stars won with a score of 13 to 8 after only 21 games. The lineups of both sides were:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Stars) Fu Qifang, Xue Xuchu, Wang Youxin, Lu Hanjun, Huang Zhijun.</p>
<p>(Confucian Society) Li Ping, Zheng Guorong, Zhong Zhancheng, Xiao Shaoqiu, Zhu Jizhi.</p>
<p>The final battle continued on the evening of the 22nd. The venue was still the China Youth Gymnasium. The Hong Kong United team was formed to face the Shanghai Stars. Although the fans were not as enthusiastic as in the first battle, they were more crowded than in the second battle.</p>
<p>Because the Shanghai Stars had the experience of two battles, they were already familiar with the playing styles of the Hong Kong players and had coping methods. When they fought, they repeatedly gained the upper hand. In this battle, the Hong Kong team responded with:</p>
<p>Zhong Zhancheng, Zhou Zhenqiu, Huang Yecheng, Chen Nengli, and Li Ping as the five generals. The Shanghai Stars used the same lineup as the previous battle. After the engagement, both sides played steadily. Until the eighth game, it was still alternating wins and losses, and it was difficult to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>However, after the ninth game, the Shanghai side won three points in a row, followed by two advantages in the thirteenth and fourteenth games. In the fifteenth game, the Hong Kong side made a counterattack and regained three points. After that, there was no more improvement. The Shanghai Stars finally defeated the Hong Kong United team with a score of 13 to 8.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stars' tour of Hong Kong is over. They are scheduled to go to Macau on the 24th. If time permits, they will go to Guangzhou for a trip before returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still lively, especially with more hucksters buying up. It is said that customers from the Longhai Railway and Guangdong are buying in large quantities recently. Low-end goods such as Yuan Bijie, light-colored shirting, and fine cloth bleaching cloth are being bought up, causing prices to rise frequently in the market. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 166,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other fine cloths such as Blue Chicken, Blue Phoenix, Five Blessings, Colored Balls, and ABC all continued to rise, ranging from 2,000 yuan to 5-6,000 yuan.

<h3>Initial Weakness and Subsequent Stability in Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks initially weakened yesterday, then stabilized. Fearn Silk opened at 29,000 yuan, with a low price of 28,800 yuan. It was then pushed up by securities firms and speculative capital, rising to 30,300 yuan before settling. Small stocks did not follow the rise. The result was a slight drop for Yeguang Paper compared to the previous close, while Fearn Silk, Fearn Beer, and British-American Tobacco rose slightly. Steel and shipping remained unchanged. Trading was not brisk.</p>
<h3>United Price Desire to Rise Lacking Strength</h3>
<p>Public bonds experienced a brief surge yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 12,400 yuan and rose to 14,300 yuan, but scattered buying could not be sustained. Many short-term speculators took profits, forcing the price down to below 12,500 yuan at the close. As a result, A, B, D, and E bonds showed slight gains compared to the previous close, while Unified C bonds fell by 700 yuan. Turnover was limited, less than three million yuan.</p>

<h3>Emergency Measures by the Sugar Industry Association - Trading Limited to Spot Goods - Strict Prohibition of Illegal Trading of Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>The price of sugar has been soaring repeatedly. The crux of the matter is purely due to illegal trading by speculators. The Sugar Industry Association has taken special emergency measures to strictly prohibit it. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It is found that the industry has always traded spot goods. Recently, warehouse receipt trading has been discovered. The 70th emergency meeting of the directors and supervisors decided to prohibit warehouse receipt trading from now on. All industry trading, regardless of the type of sugar, is limited to spot goods in this warehouse. No sugar transaction shall exceed legal profits. If anyone violates this secretly, once verified, the membership of both the buyer and seller will be revoked. If there is an intermediary agent, the agent will also be expelled and it has been stipulated that the association will suspend trading in the afternoon," it is said.</p>
<p>Temporary Market Closure</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The sugar market has been relatively strong in recent days due to strong customer demand. Yesterday, in order to avoid black market activity, the association decided to close the market for five days as a restriction. It is found that the highest price for local sugar such as Shunde Green is 150,000 yuan, Xinghua White 232,000 yuan, Xinghua Red 148,000 yuan, Hainan Red 137,000 yuan, and Diao Green 141,200 yuan. After this suppression, the sugar market may ease, it is said.</p>
<h3>Pre-Qingming Longjing Tea on the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, and the new tea from the major tea shops in this city has already been on the market. According to reports, this batch of new tea was harvested and baked in the Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Pingshan producing areas before the festival, and then shipped to Shanghai, called Pre-Qingming Longjing. The total quantity is extremely small, no more than dozens of catties, and it is brought to Shanghai by tea merchants and sold to famous tea shops, commonly known as "reporting tea," with asking prices being extremely high. The first batch of West Lake Longjing is 160,000 yuan per catty, and Wenzhou goods are about 30% lower. The selling price of the above two teas is halved. It is reported that this spring, Pre-Qingming tea is of good color, aroma, and taste due to little rain. If the weather is clear and sunny around Grain Rain, the harvest of alpine tea will be even better. According to tea industry insiders, the national tea harvest this year is estimated to increase by 50% compared to last year. The reasons are: (1) Tea farmers are gradually paying attention to this, and the work of fertilizing and weeding last winter has been improved. (2) Tea loans are relaxed, and tea farmers and tea merchants have expressed great interest. (3) After the victory, the tea gardens that were devastated in various places are striving to recover.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches Rise</h3>
<p>The price of Jinshan yuanzhi (元枝, a type of local product), has recently been tight. The asking price is 450,000 yuan. It was checked that the previous market quotation opened at around 420,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, it opened up to 440,000 yuan. Yesterday, it was quoted at 450,000 yuan and the market is expected to remain tight.</p>
<h3>Weak Circulation in Tea Market</h3>
<p>Although the peak season for the new production of various domestic teas such as Longjing is approaching, those who hold the goods are not willing to relax their sales intentions for the old stock in hand. Due to the fact that both sales in this street and to visiting merchants are extremely sluggish, buyers are only purchasing in small amounts. Yesterday's situation remained the same, with the amount of tea sold being roughly equal to the amount purchased, and the market trend was relatively flat. As for the foreign tea market, the general cargo owners still frequently offered their goods, but those who asked about the price stood by and watched, and the situation remained unchanged. The market price hovered on a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Leather Industry in This City Encounters Three Difficulties - Reduced Work or Shutdowns are Common</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: There are 330 members of the Leather Industry Association in this city, divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A manufactures sole leather, with a total of 14 members. Group B manufactures upper leather, with a total of 113 members. Group C manufactures suitcase leather, white green leather, and sheepskin, with a total of 138 members. Group D manufactures gloves and wallets, with a total of 65 members.</p>
<p>Members of groups A and B mostly have simple machines. Other leather workshops are mostly handicrafts, and the scale is not large. The monthly output is as little as ten pieces and as much as dozens of pieces. There is no fixed plan for work. When the market improves or the economy is abundant, they purchase raw hides and engage in manufacturing. If the situation is not good, they work intermittently.</p>
<p>The recent production of leather factories in this city is 300,000 pounds of sole leather, 45,000 feet of calfskin, and 60,000 feet of upper sheepskin per month. Among them, the total output of sole leather in March has been reduced to 200,000 pounds. The factories taken over by the government from the enemy and puppet regimes produce about 60,000 pounds per month. The quality of this sole leather is far superior to imported products, but the upper leather is inferior.</p>
<p>The difficulties currently facing the industry are three: (1) The new commodity tax rate is 15%. According to the industry's most prosperous production scene, the tax revenue is only 170,625,000 yuan. The national treasury revenue is very small, while the burden on the leather industry has increased significantly. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will collect taxes again when the leather industry develops.</p>
<p>(2) Currently, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the industry has to depreciate prices in order to maintain business. Since March and April, the funds earned by various businesses are only enough to pay wages and business expenses, so they have reduced work or stopped work. Those who are in a state of stagnation have reached two-tenths. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will prohibit the import of hot leather.</p>
<p>(3) The industry's costs have increased due to the burden of high-interest loans. If low-interest loans can be obtained, the cost of sole leather can be reduced by 2,000 yuan per pound, and the cost of upper leather can also be reduced by 800 yuan. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will approve small loans.</p>
<h3>Insurance Companies Require Capital of at Least 100 Million</h3>
<p>In order to rectify the insurance system, increase the compensation funds of various insurance companies, and achieve the goal of insurance security, the Ministry of Finance has specifically set the minimum capital amount for each insurance company to 100 million yuan. The original amount was 5 million yuan. Companies that have already been established and operating with capital of less than 100 million yuan must complete the capital increase verification procedures before the end of June of this year. Otherwise, they will be ordered to merge with companies with weak capital. For newly established companies, operations will be approved when the capital reaches 50 million. According to insurance industry insiders, this adjustment is the biggest reform in eight years.</p>
<h3>New Da Weaving Factory Officially Starts Operation</h3>
<p>The New Da Weaving Factory, among the weaving factories in Shanghai, has always been known as a large-scale silk factory, with sections for wool weaving, silk weaving, and cotton weaving. The factory's products are sold to various parts of Southeast Asia and enjoy a good reputation. Unfortunately, due to mismanagement and operational issues, its finances were not stable. Since it was purchased in full last month by Mr. Fu Liangjun of the New Light Underwear Company, it has been carefully planned, the organization has been improved, and it has now officially started operation. In addition to being used for the manufacture of underwear, several new products will be launched. According to experts, the factory's total assets are estimated to be at least 5 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>State-Owned Production Enterprises Valued Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs arrived in Shanghai yesterday. When reporters asked whether state-owned production enterprises would still be valued and sold since the government had stipulated that a portion of them would be used as a short-term treasury bond fund for the 36th year, Mr. Wang replied: "The valuation and sale of state-owned production enterprises is still actively underway. This is because there are many types of state-owned production enterprises and the institutions are large. Although a portion has been transferred to the short-term treasury bond fund, the valuation and sale will not be interrupted because of this. However, in the future, state-owned production enterprises that have been transferred to the short-term treasury bond fund will not be sold. Other parts will still be planned for sale and transferred to private operation," he said.</p>
<h3>Bulls Seize the Opportunity - High and Then Low in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were high and then low yesterday. Because the large yarn and flower merchant Mr. Hong was selling, the general bull also took the opportunity to sell, resulting in a high opening followed by a decline. The resistance of new buyers was weak, and the market closed at a low price near noon, causing scattered investors to feel panicked again. The morning opened high and then fell. Numbers 185, 16, 83, and 180 all advanced, and Deyong Yarn saw a high price of 2,680 yuan. Numbers 223, 89, 198, 84, 222, 160, 104, 13, and 232 were sold at a high price of 2,620 yuan. Numbers 196, 97, 89, and 142 still advanced and rose slightly, but soon Numbers 154, 199, 198, 218, 133, 232, and 185 were all sold, and by 10:15, the price had fallen to 2,580 yuan. Numbers 106, 198, 107, 207, 180, and 71 had a strange desire to buy, and they were pulled back up to 2,670 yuan. Numbers 223, 105, 156, 145, 84, and 171 were sold one after another, and the price fell again to 2,580 yuan. Numbers 24, 223, 198, and 107 once advanced to 2,640 yuan. Numbers 143, 153, 186, 218, 2, 235, and 102 all added to the close. The selling pressure suddenly increased near noon. Matches were sold from number 32 to the limit down, and Deyong Yarn fell to around 2,520 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, Deyong Yarn, Huafeng, Xinguang, Qin Xing, French, and Xinhua all fell slightly compared to the previous close. Xinhe fell by half a percent weakly, and Meiya rose slightly. Settlement prices for Deyong Yarn and Huafeng decreased, Meiya rose slightly, and Xinhe and Xinguang fell by half a percent weakly. Cold stocks such as underwear and matches fell to the limit down. Rongfeng was stable, China Textile fell by less than 10%, Tongyi by less than half a percent, and Guohuo, Jinglun, Cement, Xin Asia, and Yonggong were all weak. The fates of various stocks outside the market were mixed.</p>
<h3>Adulteration of Tobacco Leaves in Tobacco Producing Areas Such as Xuchang</h3>
<p>Xuchang and Xiangxian in Henan Province have always been major areas for the production of American tobacco leaves. In recent years, due to the lack of supervision, tobacco farmers have been accustomed to cheating. The amount of tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities accounted for more than 40% of the original weight. As a result, the quality has declined day by day, causing suffering to tobacco firms, tobacco factories, and merchants. The local administrative police commissioner's office, county government, county council, commodity tax bureau, tobacco industry association, and the tobacco production improvement office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have all recognized this. They held discussions to ban adulteration and actively improve the situation. After discussions, eight penalty rules for banning adulteration were agreed upon and implemented starting from April 1st.</p>
<p>1.  It is forbidden for tobacco buyers to indiscriminately purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities in the urban and rural areas of this county. If anyone purchases the above-mentioned tobacco leaves, in addition to confiscating 30% of the total value of the adulterated tobacco leaves purchased, they will also be ordered to reorganize the adulterated tobacco leaves purchased.</p>
<p>2.  If tobacco firms purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities on behalf of tobacco buyers, those who commit the offense for the first time will be fined a seven-day suspension of weighing. Those who commit the offense again will be fined a fifteen-day suspension of weighing. Those who commit the offense a third time will be ordered to cease operations, and the tobacco industry association will post a notice at the entrance of the firm.</p>
<p>3.  If tobacco firm tobacco masters purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities on behalf of tobacco buyers, after investigation, those who commit the offense for the first time will be fined 300,000 yuan. Those who commit the offense again will have their tobacco master qualifications revoked, and all tobacco firms will be prohibited from employing them.</p>
<p>4.  If tobacco farmers and tobacco merchants sell tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities, after investigation, in addition to demolishing and burning the bad tobacco on the spot, 3% of the total value of the tobacco leaves sold will also be confiscated.</p>
<p>5.  The County Council, Tobacco Leaf Improvement County Chamber of Commerce, Tobacco Industry Association, and Commodity Tax Bureau will send personnel to conduct detailed investigations at any time. If there are any violations, the names of the buying and selling merchants, the names of the tobacco firms, and the number of catties of mixed tobacco will be recorded immediately. Written evidence from the tobacco firm will be obtained, and the Tobacco Industry Association will be notified immediately to impose penalties in accordance with the regulations. If there is any resistance, the matter will be submitted to the county government for punishment in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>6.  In addition to the personnel sent by the above-mentioned agencies to investigate, anyone may report to the executing agency (the Tobacco Industry Association). After verification, half of the fine will be used as a reward for the informant, and their confidentiality will be maintained.</p>
<p>7.  All of the above fines will be deposited in the county treasury in a special account for local public welfare undertakings.</p>
<p>8.  These penalty rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>On the "Injustice" of the Medical Practitioner Law</h3>
<p>— Butcher</p>
<p>Three years ago, I read an article by Professor Lin Ji criticizing the Medical Practitioner Law in a Chinese medical journal, and since then I have rarely seen any systematic reviews. After the restoration, the Medical Practitioner Law also came to the occupied areas. Everyone felt strange about these two unfamiliar faces at first. In recent years, it has aroused some criticism, especially the most dissatisfaction is the third item of the third article, regarding traditional Chinese medicine, those who have practiced traditional Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputations. That is, they are eligible for medical practitioner review. This clearly lowers the qualifications for creating medical talent. Although people in the traditional Chinese medicine community do not feel that this is an insult or discrimination, at least no written dissent from traditional Chinese medicine associations or individuals has been seen in newspapers. Instead, I have seen Western medical associations and individuals with unclear qualifications protest one after another, demanding equal treatment. In other words, those who consider themselves Western doctors, "who have practiced Western medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputations," should also be able to pass the review. However, the Medical Practitioner Law does not have similar provisions for reviewing non-traditional Chinese medicine doctors. No wonder these people "cry out in injustice."</p>
<p>In fact, the Medical Practitioner Law's qualifications for traditional Chinese medicine review are not the same as those for scientific medicine, which is not a matter of "injustice," but a major stain on Chinese legislation. It is not difficult to imagine how our descendants in a few decades or centuries will resent and ridicule their 20th-century ancestors!</p>
<p>After Taiwan fell into the hands of the enemy, as early as ten years before the Republic of China, the practice of registering traditional Chinese medicine was stopped, and efforts were made to cultivate scientific doctors. By the time the atomic bomb exploded and the enemy surrendered, the Chinese problem in Taiwan had been completely resolved. Smallpox had been eradicated in Taiwan for many years, and the plague in Fujian and cholera in Shanghai had not been able to invade for a long time. However, once restored, Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland, and unscientific traditional Chinese medicine and already eradicated epidemics were also restored to their original state.</p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration in Japan was far behind the Chinese in studying Western affairs, but it grasped science, worked hard to advance, and made rapid progress. We always waver on the wrong path of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning as the application." Although the Japanese militarists led their people on the path of militarism, we cannot but admire their knowledge and understanding of science. The steps of the Japanese Meiji Restoration will eventually be the only way for us to strengthen the country. From the perspective of health construction alone, sooner or later China must also adopt the Japanese method of stopping after one-time registration, first solve the problem of unscientific traditional Chinese medicine, and health construction can be free from one obstacle, otherwise health construction will inevitably be delayed, and it may not be possible for hundreds of years. And the failure of health undertakings will inevitably affect the entire nation-building work. What kind of evil consequences will occur? It is truly terrifying!</p>
<p>The Medical Practitioner Law has many shortcomings, but the qualifications for scientific doctors follow the correct path. That is the only thing that is somewhat comforting. It is not difficult to imagine that this is the result of the enlightened people in the legislative officials wanting to preserve a glimmer of hope for the country and fighting for it. I hope that future generations will not forget that there were also some enlightened people among their 20th-century ancestors when they resent you. Especially the health authorities, who can achieve a scientific and upright position,</p>
<p>In the past, those who commented on the Medical Practitioner Law invariably criticized the Ministry of Health for this point. It should be known that it is commendable that the health authorities can barely maintain the standards of scientific doctors. To expect them to be able to argue on the basis of reason, persuade the party and state elders, and immediately imitate the Japanese Meiji Restoration and embark on the road of scientific nation-building is too high a hope.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Our health authorities are not incompetent, but too weak, without backbone." That statement is correct. They lack the support of public opinion and the assistance of backers. They dare not think about what should be done, but only work diligently to do what can be done. They are weak and have no power to resist the power of those elders. But this is also their crime, which descendants a thousand years later will not forgive!</p>
<p>The Medical Practitioner Law needs to be completely overthrown, because it violates science and is not in line with the times. Moreover, the Chinese Constitution has stipulated that a public medical system should be promoted, which is an urgent need for the world trend and national health. It is inevitable in reason and inevitable in trend. Therefore, the Medical Practitioner Law will inevitably be fundamentally revised. Due to space limitations, it will be discussed separately in another article.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— A Hong Kong Native</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>What exactly is Chinese medicine? There needs to be a clear answer, as this is a prerequisite for discussing Chinese medicine. However, my asking this question might make some suspect my "ignorance." Chinese medicine is simply Chinese medicine, nothing more to say. True, Chinese medicine is Chinese medicine, but the "theories of Chinese medicine" of the past cannot represent the "practicing Chinese medicine doctors" of today. "Theories" and "people" must be discussed separately; therefore, it is not easy to have a clear and distinct answer. The complexity of Chinese medical theories and the uneven level of practicing Chinese medicine doctors, in all their forms, cannot be summed up in a single sentence. The "theories" of Chinese medicine are "profound yet unsubstantial," but one cannot say that the "people" practicing Chinese medicine are also "profound" yet unsubstantial. In the past, some in the Western medical community made this mistake, believing that because Chinese medical theories were unacceptable, Chinese medicine doctors (people) were also unacceptable. This viewpoint is obviously wrong. We won't concern ourselves with that for now; let's turn back to Chinese medicine itself and see what kind of views they have on the essence of Chinese medicine. It turns out there is much inconsistency. Chinese medicine itself has two contradictions: one is the contradiction in academic theory—the opposition between ancient and contemporary prescriptions; the other is the coexistence of fantasy and experience. As for other contradictions in differentiation and the contradictions in theories on drug properties, anyone who has read Chinese medicine books knows that these contradictions are too numerous to count. Turning any page at random, one is immediately struck by them. In the end, at most, they can only be considered the opinion of one school of thought, not even "officially recognized" by Chinese medicine itself. This is speaking of the "theories" of Chinese medicine in the past. Now, let's look at the "practicing Chinese medicine doctors" of today! They have also never found a correct way out. Needless to say, the complete conservatives are still there, but the inherent theories of Chinese medicine have already gone bankrupt. Therefore, those who are ambitious in Chinese medicine are doing their best to excavate a treasure. When they reach this dead end, reform is imperative. So, from which aspect should they reform? Naturally, it becomes "Westernization!" As usual, the call for Chinese medicine to be Westernized did not begin today. However, after more than ten years of Westernization, there has not been much progress, which is another contradiction of today's practicing Chinese medicine doctors: they have not yet understood the true essence of scientification. It's really laughable. Recently, some people even said, "The scientification of Chinese medicine should not be Westernization" (original text from New China Medicine Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 3). This kind of master-slave mentality seems to imply that "Western medicine" is not "scientific," which is a wonderful argument. Some still believe that Chinese medicine is a synthesis of "science and philosophy" (Mr. Ding Zhongying's words). At the same time, someone named Lu, in an article titled "Experience and Metaphysics" in the Yousheng Medical Journal, said that Chinese medicine has nothing to do with metaphysics or philosophy. They are all Chinese medicine doctors today, yet they contradict each other to this extent. In addition, Mr. Zhang Cigong, who calls himself a traitor to Chinese medicine, says that Chinese medical theory can be completely abolished and that everything from scientific medicine should be accepted. In that case, the "new Chinese medicine" of the future would simply be the application of Chinese herbal medicine by Western medicine. Look at their brilliant arguments, conflicting with each other to this extent. It can be seen that my question "What is Chinese medicine?" is actually "not inappropriate." Whether it is the past or present Chinese medical community, they have never clarified their own essence. How can you expect them to have any improvements? However, it must be said that there are indeed some in the Chinese medical community who can truly be scientified, and these people are quite meticulous. Therefore, Mr. Liu Jingzhou published an article titled "Nagging" in the People's Police Journal last month, saying that he saw several articles in the "publications hosted by the Chinese medicine section of the News Daily" that hardly relied on "Yin-Yang and the Five Elements" to make arguments. Therefore, he expressed great respect for these authors. Indeed, Chinese medicine has progressed. It is a pity that the gentlemen are much more insightful and thorough. As Mr. Pang said, "It's hard to turn around for a while." Although there are many reasons for this, partly due to incomplete thinking and the resistance of conservatives, the fact is that they have not been given the opportunity to "turn around" because most Chinese medicine doctors are not educated enough to learn Western medicine (of course, the stubborn conservatives are excluded). Since Chinese medicine is still Chinese medicine and the government has not provided special facilities to guide their "way out," on the other hand, some in the Western medical community still oppose the scientification of "Chinese medicine" and strongly advocate that Chinese medicine should be allowed to live and die on its own, ignoring it. This is why they want to "turn around" and reform but cannot. Therefore, I hope that the Western medical community will support this group of new Chinese medicine doctors who obey science and guide them onto the right track in order to eliminate this situation of "dualistic medicine" (Mr. Liu Jingzhou's words) where Chinese and Western medicine are in conflict. The future of Chinese medicine is closely related to this. It is not enough to write a few "new terms" in articles. We must also take concrete measures to further provide them with opportunities to supplement their scientific knowledge and improve their clinical application skills. This is the true scientification of Chinese medicine! Okay, this introduction has already been written too long. Below, I will point out the thoughts that represent a part of Chinese medicine, the stumbling blocks that hinder the process of Westernization, and the misunderstandings of the theory of the scientification of Chinese medicine. The question "What exactly is Chinese medicine?" can also be explained incidentally, because this resistance is actually more misleading than the stubbornness of the "orthodox faction" mentioned by Mr. Pang, and it is also essential to expose it.

<h3>A Discussion on Measles (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>(IV) Prevention and Mortality of Measles</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the general prognosis of measles can be said to be good, but it is extremely related to the patient's health condition. For example, patients with tuberculosis, rickets, or whooping cough often have a poor prognosis. Adult measles can sometimes also develop severe symptoms. It is also related to the nature of the epidemic. Often, during a major epidemic in a certain year, there are many deaths. Speaking of mortality, it is very related to age. From statistics, we know that 90% of measles deaths are young children under the age of six. According to the statistics of the city of Frankfurt, Germany, in 1909, the number of measles patients and the death rate per 100,000 people of various ages are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Patients Number of Deaths</p>
<p>0-1 year 180.0 45.0</p>
<p>1-5 years 637.0 25.0</p>
<p>6-15 years 253.0 1.4</p>
<p>16-20 years 1.0 0.0</p>
<p>20-30 years 3.3 0.1</p>
<p>Over 30 years 0.7 0.0</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mortality rate of measles is related to wealth and poverty. According to Blr-tillon's statistics, the mortality rate per 100,000 people is as follows:</p>
<p>Paris Berlin Vienna</p>
<p>Richest 2.8 9.1 1.1</p>
<p>Poorest 24.3 28.8 13.6</p>
<p>(V) Prevention Methods for Measles</p>
<p>Measles is an infectious disease, and isolation is certainly an important method. If one child in a family develops measles, other children who have not developed measles should be isolated and avoid contact, especially when the nature of the measles is malignant. But in fact, when one child in a family develops it, even if other children avoid contact, it is ineffective, because the measles is already contagious during its incubation period (that is, from four days before the rash appears). Therefore, some people advocate that, except when measles epidemics are malignant, children under the age of three who have glandular diathesis and tuberculosis should be allowed to become infected.</p>
<p>Degkwitx obtained excellent results by using serum from patients in the recovery period of measles, that is, those who have already acquired immunity, to prevent measles. That is, choose measles patients without complications, wait seven to nine days after they have recovered from the fever, take their serum, and inject it into children suspected of being infected to prevent transmission. It is easy to see results five to six days before the end of the incubation period; after seven days, it is ineffective. If there is no serum from patients in the recovery period of measles, using the serum of both parents is also effective. This method is suitable for malignant measles epidemics as mentioned above, as well as for children under three years old who also have tuberculosis and whooping cough, etc.</p>
<p>(VI) Several Important Notes on Caring for Measles</p>
<p>People often focus on medicine when it comes to illness and neglect nursing care; in reality, nursing care is very important. A little carelessness can make a big difference. Now, I will write down the points to pay attention to when caring for measles below:</p>
<p>(1) Keep warm. Everyone knows that warmth is needed for measles. It is best to keep the room temperature at 18 degrees Celsius, but some careless parents let their children get cold. For example, at night, the child accidentally kicks off the blanket, and the cold can easily cause pneumonia.</p>
<p>(2) Keep the indoor air humid. Using a nebulizer to spread water vapor in the room can facilitate the cough and expectoration of phlegm.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The Problem of Reconstructing the Racecourse</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>The period when the British and French had concessions in Shanghai was indeed a kind of colonial policy, but culturally, it cannot be said that there were no achievements at all. The schools, parks, streets, and buildings built by the Municipal Council also greatly influenced the transformation of the Chinese mainland. This time, when we took over the occupied areas, everyone focused their attention on materials but few people paid attention to culture!</p>
<p>The British and French both had museums and libraries in Shanghai, such as the museum run by the Royal Asiatic Society, which had a rich collection, especially in anthropology, containing many treasures. The skull of "Peking Man," which shocked the world, was also among them. In addition, there were more than 50,000 Western books. On the French side, there was the Aurora Museum, which, in addition to flora and fauna, especially insects, included species that had been studied by the Jesuit Father Heude. The library of the French Association also had tens of thousands of books. These are all achievements left by the British and French, which have been in operation for eighty or ninety years, or at least fifty or sixty years! We should earnestly continue to support these cultural treasures, and international cultural organizations should also provide them with more funding.</p>
<p>The newspaper has previously advocated rebuilding the Shanghai Racecourse into a park, which I think is very reasonable. I also suggest that a World Museum be built in this great park. The museum should mainly display Chinese natural artifacts, and can also ask the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to solicit cultural relics from various countries. In this way, it is not difficult to create the richest and most beautiful museum in the East. People from Europe and the United States can get a glimpse of the preciousness of Eastern culture when they first arrive in China, and compare it with the cultures of various countries. What a great undertaking this is!</p>
<p>Next to the museum, if the open space is wide and there are sufficient financial resources, a library, a theater, an art gallery, a sports field, a music stage, etc. can also be built. In this way, the old racecourse will become the cultural center of Shanghai. Agricultural and industrial expositions can also be held in the open space, citizen assemblies can be held, and sports competitions, open-air music performances...</p>
<p>Our ideal Shanghai is the most modern garden city in the world, and also the cultural center of East Asia, and the gathering place of world culture. All facilities are built using the latest scientific and industrial technologies, and decorated with the highest forms of literature and art; raising the interests of life, and actively promoting the exchange of human culture, making the international cultural city a glorious city that upholds humanitarianism and justice, just like Athens in ancient Greece. However, Athens symbolizes a narrow patriotic ideology, and does not yet have a sound sense of global harmony!</p>
<h3>A Taste of the Arts</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>In the past, Mei Shengyu had a poem that said: "A wild spirit loves books and paintings, but lacks the strength to acquire them; whenever he meets people of high taste, he always asks to show them." Whenever I recite this verse, I can't help but smile, because it's as if it came from my own mouth. After I saw the precious paintings and calligraphy collected by Zhang Ziboju, because they were all exceptional works, I made a detailed record of them. Ye Xia'an, from Panyu, saw it in the newspaper and also wanted to see them. At the same time, Gu and other gentlemen, friends of Boju, also gathered at Boju's house after seeing the report, and I was able to accompany them several times and browse through them. Among them were some that were not included in the previous record. Therefore, I will re-record them as follows.</p>
<p>1. Zhao Mengfu's Small Script Lotus Sutra Scroll: This is the third volume of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra written by Songxue. The entire scroll is complete from beginning to end. It is said that Zhao Wuxing's small script is written with a flourish, because it is not only difficult to be neat, but also difficult to be fast. If his brushwork were not so swift, there would definitely not be so many of his small scripts passed down to the world. This scroll is not one of his finest works, but the starting and ending points of the brushstrokes and the turning points are clearly discernible.</p>
<p>2. Zhao Mengfu's Cursive Script Thousand Character Classic: Formerly in the Qing Palace collection, its brocade mounting is already damaged. The paper and ink of this scroll are far better than the previous one. He wrote many Thousand Character Classics, and the one I have seen is the best of them all. His brushwork is round, vigorous, and full of spirit, purely in the style of Zhi Yong, but the structure has many Zhang Cao elements. It seems that he deliberately studied the water master and played tricks to change the structure. After that, Liu Guan's inscription is in the style of Huaisu's cursive script. The inscriptions I have seen are all small regular script characters about half an inch in size. This one is written in cursive script, as if trying to match the drunken monk with Yong Shi. His calligraphy is not very good. Also, on a line at the end of the Thousand Character Classic paper, there is a small square seal in seal script that says "Songxuezhai Tushuji," which is also rarely seen.</p>
<p>3. Wen Zhengming's Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu Scroll: This is a work of Hengshan's meticulous interest. The so-called "Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu" refers to the preface to the New Lychee Poem composed by Hengshan after the painting, which says, "The Gu family of Changshu moved several lychee trees from Fujian, and they survived after a year. Shen Shitian asked someone to break off a branch to look at it, and the cassia leaves were dense, and he dared not believe it. He showed it to a Fujianese, and it was indeed so! Therefore, he wrote a New Lychee Poem and ordered Bi Tong to compose one as well." After a while, he also did a sketch. This is the Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu Scroll. In the past, mountains and rivers were separated, and foreign lands were not visible. That's why "seeing a camel, they thought it was a horse with a swollen back." And "the cassia leaves were dense," which made old man Shitian dare not believe it was lychee. This is what people in Shanghai call "Ama Ling" today. If people like Wen and Shen were born today, with the convenience of air travel, they would arrive in no time. Not only would fresh lychees not be strange, but there would also be people who would use airplanes to carry dogs even when besieged cities were falling! However, although today's dignitaries can use airplanes to carry dogs, no one like Hengshan can paint lychees on silk. This allows Shitian and Hengshan to look down on "Kang Baidu" as "Ama Ling"! Hengshan painted ten branches of Fujian lychee on silk, and the colors are extremely beautiful, all using ancient methods. I recently read Wu Heyu's "Summer Records in Xin Chou," which mentions the lychees painted by Cai Junhan. I have not seen Cai's paintings, so I don't know how wonderful they are. But in this scroll by Hengshan, the branches and leaves are sparse, and the crimson peel is mottled, which is captivating. At the back of the scroll, Hengshan himself wrote a long ancient poem in response to Shen Shitian's New Lychee Poem on paper. The poem is both elegant and the calligraphy is beautiful. There are one or two places where there are typos with annotations. This is exactly what Jiang Baishi meant when he said that he didn't mind the occasional typo.</p>
<p>4. Fang Congyi's Yunlin Zhongxiu Scroll: This Fang Congyi's Yunlin Zhongxiu Scroll is an ink painting on paper. The four characters "Yunlin Zhongxiu" are at the beginning of the painting. At the top of the tail of the painting are the fourteen characters "Hongwu Dingyi Fang Huzi Made as a Gift to Deng Zhi'an Returning to the Court." The four characters "Fang Huzi Hua" are written in the middle of the painting on a high peak like a cliff inscription. All three of these are in the official script. Later, Shen Shitian wrote a poem: "The Shangqing Immortal is originally a celestial being, descending to cultivate the ink relationship. I heard that the moon on the top of the Pipa Ridge shines on the yellow crane returning for thousands of years." I observe that although this painting generally uses the meaning of Mi's cloud mountains, its hills and peaks are steep and the clouds are misty. His brushstrokes in painting clouds are unrestrained and unrestrained, not limited by Mi's method, and signing his name on the top of the hill is also a practice that goes back to the Tang Dynasty. Master Ye Xia'an said that there are several forgeries of this painting. The number of forgeries is imaginable. His words are numerous and cannot be fully recorded. But he believes that this book is genuine.</p>
<p>Also, I have had the opportunity to re-examine Boju's Five Yuan Dynasty Paintings that I mentioned earlier, which are Zhao Zhongmu, Wang Meng, Zhu Zemin, Zhang Gui, and Fang Congyi. In the lower left corner of Zhu Zemin's painting is a small red seal with four characters "Shen Zhou Bao Wan," which is recorded here.</p>
<p>5. Wu Li's Xingfu Temple Nostalgic Painting Scroll: This painting is on silk. It was painted by Wu Yushan in the year of Jia Yin to commemorate his monastic friend, Monk Merong. On it, Yushan wrote by hand that he was a good friend with Monk Merong in writing and painting, and attached two poems of mourning. According to records, Xingfu Temple is in Changshu, and the temple still exists today. In this picture by Yushan, the branches and leaves are falling, the crows are flying and resting, the scripture room is empty and silent, and the solitary crane does not croak. A kind of sad wind and desolate situation can be heard as if there is sound. The ancients said that emotion generates writing, and writing also generates emotion. This painting is intertwined with emotion and writing. Watching it is sad, and it makes people sigh and increase the importance of life, death, and friends. It's a real masterpiece!</p>
<p>6. Qian Shunju's Mountain Dwelling Map Scroll: This volume is on paper. It uses the method of the green and gold landscape of General Li. In its clear green and heavy, there is a kind of clear, leisurely and distant interest, so it is high. Master Ye Xia'an said that he had seen a book with the same meaning, brushwork, and paper crown as this one. This book has no inscription at the back. But the other book has it. The three words "Mountain Dwelling Map" are in front of this book, but not in the other. It is suspected that it is the same book, which was cut into two in the Ming Dynasty. I don't know why. This volume was originally collected by Gao Jiangcun and has its inscription at the end. It was returned to Shao Songnian in the Republic of China. Shao's inscription is several. They are all small and fine regular scripts. Shao's small true script was also quite famous at that time.</p>
<p>7. Mi Youren's Yao Mountain Autumn Study Map Scroll: Zhao Su inscribed at the back of this volume that it was written by Mi Huer. Su's name is Yan Gong, and he is the son of Songxue.</p>
<p>8. Wen Zhengming's Three Friends Picture: Wen Dai Zhao's ink paintings of orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo are three scrolls on paper, all with poems. The orchid painting is written in the style of Su Dongpo, and the chrysanthemum is written in the style of Shangu. The bamboo inscription is in his own style. Zhi Liu said that the world has passed on Shen Shitian's paintings in a bold style, and Wen Hengshan has passed on more delicate paintings. Therefore, the world values "rough Wen and fine Shen". Hengshan's three works have a lonely artistic conception, beyond the brush and ink, and are the work of a temporary recreation and self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>9. Song Huizong's Snow River Returning Boat Map Scroll True Work: This is a rare treasure. It was collected by Wang Mengzhou's brothers. When Zhang Jiangling was in the phase, he wanted to take it by force but failed. Such a dramatic work should not be recorded in a hurry. We should wait for a clear window on a sunny day, when the mood is broad and happy, to carefully recognize it.</p>

<h3>The Special Characteristics of Ancient Beauty</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>The history of the pursuit of beauty can be said to have begun simultaneously with the history of mankind. This can be proven not only in the broad sense of cultural archeology, ethnology, and geology, but also clearly demonstrated in various theories of art origins, which could be called the biology of aesthetics, or in sociology and art. In particular, the development of modern art science has increasingly led us to believe that the emergence of beauty occurred in the same period as the emergence of mankind—that is, mankind already possessed the creation of beauty at its inception, although it was extremely naive. We do not need to cite the theories of Groos, Grosse, Philon, Ount, Herrenstein, Habert, Lido, Lalo, and others.</p>
<p>As a result of detailed and meticulous investigations and inferences of the excavations considered to have been created by primitive ancient people, we can know that tens of thousands of years ago on Earth, there were creatures skilled in the working techniques of beauty, at least proto-humans belonging to creatures higher than animals. The existence of proto-humans within the scope of learning can only be inferred from skeletons found in France and Spain, drawings on rocks, bone carvings, and extremely simple paintings with wild cattle as subjects. However, we can easily imagine that these primitive people may have existed not only in these few places but also in Asia and other continents.</p>
<p>That being said, the era was 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, and these so-called most ancient primitive people went through the Paleolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, and the Bronze and Iron Age of metal tools in archeology, the three eras of so-called primitive culture, gradually evolving through various stages. The methods of expressing beauty also differed depending on the race and region. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a general statement on the living conditions or artistic characteristics of primitive people. For example, some races possessed advanced artistic expression and shaping abilities for sculpture or painting, while others only demonstrated some artistic talents in body decoration or dance. Therefore, there are differences in their aesthetic standards or cultural levels.</p>
<p>From a phenomenal perspective, the initial Paleolithic Age involved hunting and nomadic life, the Neolithic Age saw the beginning of agricultural life, and the final Metal Age began with a family life history of gradually using daily utensils.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the initial signs of nomadic life transforming into group life could be discovered. At the same time, it could be known that various forms of aesthetic expression arising from various living conditions would gradually transform into the genuine cultural ancients and ancient life of the next generation—that is, in organized social institutions, ancient peoples and ancient countries created a highly collective art and culture. The uncivilized ancient races, which sociologists or ethnologists call "primitive peoples" or "natural peoples," will evolve into more civilized ancient civilizations; and these more civilized peoples possess organized hunting, fishing, animal husbandry, farming, and the production or invention of stone and metal. From this cultural life, ideals or expressions of beauty that adapt to this life gradually emerge, which are higher-level plastic arts.</p>
<p>From here began the great migration of peoples, and the ancient era took this era as a turning point, jumping from the previous century to the new century and marking out two distinct generations. These new generations of people were no longer unorganized natural peoples, and their art and culture were not as simple as the previous generation. The most ancient yellow-brown races of Asian descent, the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Babylonians, as well as the most ancient white races of European descent, the Greeks, each established ancient states and ancient art.</p>
<p>In this way, a truly decent culture, like art, was formed with the establishment of the state. Among the ancient peoples, the Hamitic Egyptians, the Semitic peoples of Mesopotamia, and the Aryan Greeks, the ancestors of white culture, although slightly earlier or later, built cultural states in roughly the same period, that is, in the ancient era of the ten or several centuries before the Christian era. Here, we can discover the history of ancient society, ancient peoples, and ancient art closely combining and developing.</p>
<p>Beauty in ancient times, in other words, classical beauty, can be said to be a high-level cultural phenomenon that began simultaneously with the rise of these three great peoples. Other ancient peoples of the same era included the Persians, Hebrews, Phoenicians, and the so-called Mediterranean peoples in the archipelago area, as well as the ancient Romans who inherited Greek culture; however, ancient art and culture all originated from the aforementioned three great peoples spanning Africa, Western Asia, and Southern Europe. Therefore, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece can be considered the archetypes of ancient times."</p>
<p>Although the ancient beauty represented by these three great peoples each had its own characteristics, it should be noted that the art and culture of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece have a common and universal aesthetic quality: this universality is that each of the three ancient countries had its own gods, its own service-oriented life goals, and its own fiery ideal of beauty. That is to say, all had myths closely combined with the creative spirit of the nation, temples and statues expressing the divine beauty of ancestor worship; national festivals expressing common joy, symbols of the beauty of national ideals such as the worship of emperors, heroes, or nature, and the service of huge objects derived from them, and their shaping expressions.</p>
<h3>### Ten Nights in New York (In Front of Columbia University) (Watercolor)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shao</p>
<h3>### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 309</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Tsurumi instructed the maid to call the embassy and ask when Miss Nakamura would arrive there and if she was still there. If she had left, when did she leave?</p>
<p>The maid agreed and took two steps but turned back and looked at Tsurumi:</p>
<p>"Perhaps Miss Nakamura went to another place?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Tsurumi stared at the maid. "What makes you think of that?"</p>
<p>"Miss Nakamura was just about to go out when she received a letter. I saw Miss Nakamura read the letter and carefully wrote down some of the words on the letter in a small notebook. Maybe it's a place name?..."</p>
<p>"The letter?... Is it still in Miss Nakamura's room?" Tsurumi became even more uneasy.</p>
<p>"It's probably still in the room. I..."</p>
<p>"Yes, go get it quickly!" Tsurumi waved his hand.</p>
<p>The maid flitted out and immediately rushed back, holding an opened letter in her hand. Tsurumi took the letter and saw that neither side of the envelope had a return address, obviously delivered by someone. Taking out the letter, it was written in Japanese on the stationery:</p>
<p>"Miss Nakamura: Received a telegram informing me of your arrival in the south, but without specifying your Shanghai residence, so I had someone deliver this. If you have time, please come to the Bund Park by the river between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. and meet someone wearing a white kimono and holding a red Western book. I earnestly request a meeting. Xi Ping."</p>
<p>"Please call first," Tsurumi instructed the maid. The maid responded and left.</p>
<p>"Shanghai is so complex, so powerful! I didn't expect it... " Tsurumi clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth in the empty space in the room.</p>
<p>"This is because the captain hasn't been to Shanghai and can't get a handle on things right away; actually, it's not very complex: In the 'Concessions,' apart from the activities of the Chinese military and government, there are only the Green and Red Gangs, which are organized and have more order than the military and government. The Green Gang is the most active, seemingly chaotic, but the highest command can directly reach the lowest level, and as long as there is 'one word,' it is 100% effective..."</p>
<p>"Oh?... There is such a tight organization?" Tsurumi was somewhat skeptical.</p>
<p>"That's due to the traditional superstitious potential created by—Jianghu loyalty—the Chinese current government army used them once when heading north, and they also performed well in the last Zhabei conflict (referring to the January 28th Incident)..."</p>
<p>"This is very interesting..." Tsurumi seemed very attentive.</p>
<p>"The rest are the two Westerner power groups in charge of the 'Concessions'; of course, the captain knows this... But under these power groups, there is also a kind of Sino-foreign organization, which also has a kind of power—relying on Western power on the one hand, and also having some relations with the Green Gang on the other hand—however, the most chaotic is still our side (referring to the Japanese side). So, regarding the Chinese side, you only need to grasp the outline and negotiate with their leaders to understand..."</p>
<p>"The friend you just mentioned, is he someone from these gangs?" Tsurumi remembered Iwasaki's words "ask a friend to inquire."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Iwasaki seemed unable to correct himself. "No, no! That is another mysterious and public organization, the group is very clean; there are only a dozen high-ranking figures."</p>
<p>"What kind of high-ranking figures?" Tsurumi paid even more attention.</p>
<p>"It's hard to explain in a moment," Iwasaki seemed somewhat dazed, "Even his subordinates haven't figured it out. Looking at their actions, it's like ancient kendo swordsmen..."</p>
<h3>### The Increase of Zero</h3>
<p>— Newsboy</p>
<p>Any formula is worthy of learning, but only the increase of zero makes us feel particularly unfortunate. In the past, the increase of zero in personal income was a miracle, but today, when banknotes have grown from single digits to five digits, the measure of life in between cannot be measured in miles. This may be an intolerable error in mathematics, but in reality, as far as we know, the increase of zero is always equal to the number before the zero was increased. You certainly don't admit that a four-digit number can be equal to a five-digit number, because there is one more digit, one more zero; however, on the thermometer of life, we can often make such calculations, drawing an exact equal sign between the four-digit number half a year ago and the five-digit number half a year later.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a game, a game of numbers.</p>
<p>May everyone be able to stick their head out from the zero, be able to move forward from a string of zeros. Unfortunately, like the infinity of the universe, the increase of zero is also infinite. Such a long-distance race is ultimately exhausting. Overcoming a zero? There is another zero.</p>
<p>As the poem says: When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you suspect there is no road, but willows are dark and flowers are bright, and there is another village. I am just afraid that although there is a resting place ahead, the one who travels a hundred miles is halfway at ninety, and no one's foot strength can handle this last stretch of time. When it comes to life, we, like Mr. Churchill, think that it is best before 1946. The road after 1946 is the narrowest road, too narrow to accommodate people walking.</p>
<p>Now, there is only such hope, to order the increase of zero: Stop!</p>
<h3>### A Symbol</h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>It's "Children's Day" again.</p>
<p>I only found out when I opened the newspaper in the morning. Only then did I think of some feelings, which shows the slowness of my senses. Having Children's Day is obviously a kind of progress, because it shows that we have paid attention to children.</p>
<p>Children's Day will pass in the blink of an eye, but children still exist. I always feel that "Children's Day" is like a kind of grace from adults. It's like elders giving children lucky money, which certainly makes the children happy, but it's mostly a show of face.</p>
<p>If someone says that China since the Republic of China has really made no progress, this statement is certainly infuriating to us.</p>
<p>For example, "Children's Day" certainly did not exist before the Republic of China, but now it does. In fact, this is still something for adults. When adults have no way, they mostly can't even put on a show of face. Therefore, it's hard to say that Children's Day is a kind of progress. However, since it exists, it always counts as paying attention to children. I think children will get better year by year, this is real progress.</p>
<p>I remember that Adam Smith described China in many parts of "The Wealth of Nations." In one place, he said that marriage is rewarded in China, but what is the method of reward? It is the freedom to kill children. In every big city, abandoned babies are found on the streets and alleys every night, or simply thrown into the water. And it is said that there is also a profession that relies on killing babies for food.</p>
<p>It was one hundred and seventy years ago when Adam Smith said these words. And these words still apply to the current Shanghai or all of China.</p>
<p>Adam Smith's original intention is of course quite easy to understand. He is not saying that there is really a law that rewards killing children. In Chinese social ethics, the absolute power of parents reflects the feudal autocratic political system. After marriage, one can become a parent at any time, and once one is a parent, this absolute power comes with it. "Accept small punishments, run away from big punishments." The ancient sages had quite a few teachings on how to be a son.</p>
<p>Smith said quite humorously about "the freedom to kill children" and "professionals," intending to show the stagnation of Chinese society. This is a fact. This stagnation has not stopped even after the Xinhai Revolution and the eight-year War of Resistance. So this phenomenon still exists today.</p>
<p>Smith said a not-so-thorough sentence, saying that although China is stagnant, it has not regressed, because cities abandoned by residents have not been seen.</p>
<p>Residents have certainly not abandoned the cities, but the cities are abandoning the residents. This was really not easy to discern for the old Mr. Smith of one hundred and seventy years ago.</p>
<p>Despite adorning Children's Day, society is actually still stagnant. We have all seen reports of government subsidies for childbearing in the UK and that children in Japan are well-nourished, right? To see the progress or regression of a society, taking how it treats children as a symbol is probably not wrong. (April 4th)</p>
<h3>### Ye Chucang's Humorous Poems</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chucang participated in politics with the status of a poet. He loved wine and was good at poetry all his life, and enjoyed drinking and chanting poems every day. He was friendly with Shao Boqian, Liu Shannong, Wu Lianzhou, and Wu Sanchi. Lianzhou was hunchbacked, Shannong had a pockmarked face, Sanchi was hard of hearing, and Boqian was a dwarf. One day, they gathered for a drink, and Chucang's poetic inspiration suddenly surged. He immediately composed four poems and gave them to his friends. The poem for Liu Shannong said: "Why bother to decorate with powder if you are not beautiful? Even if you decorate with powder, you can't hide it. Marrying a pockmarked face is not a good match, it is no different from a tortoise shell. Leaving traces beyond the beard and eyebrows, with flaws in the mouth and nose. How can it be that you are only greedy for a midday nap under the eaves? The plum blossoms fall on your forehead in the wind?" The poem for Wu Lianzhou said: "Your body seems burdened and your hands seem to carry it, your appearance is truly worthy of lamenting regret; your hunchback is like a new moon, your giant shoulders are like late-blooming rainbows. Although picking things has been convenient, it always feels uneven when you are dressed in blue. May I ask what causes this disfigurement? Why do you always lower your head when you meet people?" The poem for Wu Sanchi said: "You have not become a master, yet the disease has already formed, Heaven is playing tricks too mercilessly. You raise your head to ask repeatedly before you understand, you listen carefully before you understand. To make friends, you must draw words to be humorous, please raise your voice when you talk and laugh. It is said that there is an ancient method of treatment, it is appropriate to drink heavily on the day of the community." The poem for Shao Boqian said: "The most annoying thing in the world is to chant about dwarfs, who is difficult to fill five feet of body. The Chu Kingdom welcomed guests and used dogs to write letters, He Lang played with friends like monkeys; How can Zhong Cuo be a true poet? You are still a small man. Even if you have the talent to pass the imperial examination, how can you avoid ridicule with half a body?" Each poem sings the characteristics of each friend, with humor and laughter, enough to make the hall laugh.</p>

<h3>### Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>According to the Social Bureau's survey, the number of unemployed workers in this city has reached 250,000.</p>
<p>If each unemployed worker originally had to support three wives and children, then one million people in Shanghai will feel the hardship of life and cry for hunger and cold.</p>
<p>This terrible and staggering huge number is truly a hidden worry of society and a source of social crisis!</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>### The Younger Brother is Older Than the Older Brother</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>In this world, there are really many strange and bizarre things. Here, the author will tell you an even stranger thing, that is, the younger brother's age can be older than the older brother's.</p>
<p>We know that there is a date line in the Pacific Ocean, which, according to geography, is the meridian of 180 degrees east and west longitude. In fact, this line is not drawn straight, because it avoids the land. Passing through this line will skip twenty-four hours. For example, if you pass this line from east to west on December 31, it will be January 2 of the following year. It can be said that you have missed the New Year's Day of the past year, but the end of December 31 and the beginning of January 2 are connected, and there is no missing page on the calendar.</p>
<p>If a pregnant woman is on a ship crossing the Pacific Ocean from China to the United States, and she happens to give birth to a boy when passing this date line, suppose it is at 12 o'clock on January 1, 1947, and then gives birth to a twin brother fifteen minutes later, this little brother's birthday is December 31, 1946. Isn't the younger brother's age older than the older brother's?</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve of 1946 on one side of the date line, music celebrating New Year's Day of 1947 was received by radio. Conversely, you can hear the songs of last year again this year. Someone died on December 31, but someone saw him alive on New Year's Day of the following year. These are all tricks played by the date line.</p>
<h3>### Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Old Zhu had already heard something from Xu Fatty about her and Old Zhu, but he had always had only a kind of contemptuous pity for this indecisive woman and did not care about her, so he did not investigate further.</p>
<p>"I want to go to the Art Museum, but it's not certain yet." He told her frankly.</p>
<p>"Then how about treating me to some snacks? I'm leaving tomorrow!" She moved her body closer to Old Zhu and said softly.</p>
<p>Old Zhu glanced at her. Jin Aili was looking at him with a pleading expression.</p>
<p>"Okay! Where do you want to go?"</p>
<p>A look of excitement suddenly appeared on the other person's face.</p>
<p>"Hot bread on Fengbei Road, do you like to eat it?" Her voice was even more charming.</p>
<p>Old Zhu nodded, grabbed her and dived into the car.</p>
<p>"This is probably the chairman's racing car, right?" He said jokingly.</p>
<p>Jin Aili smiled shyly, her ears were a little red, and she didn't answer. Old Zhu didn't ask further.</p>
<p>The Guangdong store selling hot bread and soy milk had very little business, and people were eager to flee, even their appetites were reduced.</p>
<p>"The rumors are very tight, don't you want to leave yet?" Jin Aili asked very concerned.</p>
<p>Old Zhu was drinking soy milk like crazy.</p>
<p>"Really, I'm not lying to you! Yesterday, Old Zhu and the others said that a special plane from Li Gongguan had also flown away, the situation is really wrong!" Jin Aili emphasized again.</p>
<p>"But, we can't leave even if we want to!" Old Zhu shook his head, still with a playful smile. "They want people to take airplanes, you rich people take cars, and people with thicker legs take trains, what about us? We can only fight to save our legs, and talk about it when we really want to escape!"</p>
<p>Jin Aili was eating a piece of bread smeared with butter elegantly. After hearing Old Zhu's words, she also felt a little sad and unhappy.</p>
<p>"Old Zhu!" She moved her head closer to Old Zhu's shoulder and said in a very low voice: "Do you need money?"</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"Someone said Old Zhu gave you a lot of US dollars, is that true?" He asked her back, but did not look at her.</p>
<p>The person being asked's cheeks were completely flushed, she lowered her head and said nothing; after a while, her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>Old Zhu didn't pay attention to her, picked up a steaming round bread and swallowed it in big bites. (36)</p>
