<p>〔本報鎭江十一日電〕蘇省會各界十一日召開戡平匪亂運動談話會，幷定廿日舉行擁護總動員戡亂救國大會。</p>
<p>〔本報太原十一日電〕晋籍參政員李培德，劉杰，武誓彭，張一善，頃上電主席，擁護「七七」訓詞，願喚起三晋民衆，以竟戡亂全功。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會席上　白部長報告軍政　加強地方武力尤屬重要</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕參政會駐委會，十一日上午九時在國民大會堂舉行第二次會議，由莫德惠主席，秘書處作報吿事項後，即請國防部長白崇禧報吿最近軍政情形，據稱：全國總動員令頒布後，軍政計劃主要在充實第一綫兵幽，建設第二綫兵國，同時，在官兵待遇方面，希求得一合理之調整，現行政院原則上已決　亦加。士飽馬　，剿匪軍事。　　早日完成。惟軍政計劃，必須與民政配合，方能收預期之效果，軍隊雖在作戰上，可得到點與綫之控制，而面之把握，端頓全體民衆，倘全國民衆均能加緊組織訓練，地方武力能予加强，且全國之財力。物力亦能同時動員，則當前之全國總動員，始不致洛空。白部長於此，並詳述民衆組訓之重要及渠個人在廣西組訓民衆之經騐稱：根據本人過去之經騐，本人不惟對此感到極大興趣，幾已迷信民衆武力可克服一切。</p>

<h3>洩漏機密新聞　各參政員均主査究</h3>
<p>〔又電〕參政會駐委會若干機密新聞之洩漏問題，經彭革陳參政員，於十一日該會第二次會議中提出後，已引起全體與會參政員之極大注意，咸以為政府各機關首長每次被邀出席駐會委員會之報吿，均係將各該機關已經辦理、正在辦理或即將辦理之事，提出詳細報吿，內容方面，多少帶有機密性質，僅作參攷，非供發表者。今若干新聞竟然洩漏，此不惟影響駐會委會之信譽，使今後各政府首長出席報吿時有所顧忌，不能暢所欲言，且洩漏者本身，在道義上，法律上，均負有責任，尤其駐會委會第一次會議時，外長王世杰之報吿，曾一再請求不能外露，但結果仍有數外報刋出，且與王外長之原報吿不無出入，增加外交上困難殊多，故各參政員對此項新聞之洩漏，均主張査究。</p>
<h3>魯南收復水　青島外圍轉緊</h3>

<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕共軍四縱隊萬餘人，連日分路竄犯棗莊·嶧縣·現國軍已將其歸路切斷，正分別聚殲中。</p>
<p>〔本報臨沂十一日電〕魯南國軍所展開之殲滅戰，已獲局部勝利，共軍殘餘主力又紛紛突圍北竄。國軍於收復河陽，湯頭，靑駝，界湖等重要據點後，正與沂水，蒙陰國軍向各路殘匪追擊中亡至少在六萬至八萬之間。</p>
<p>〔本報兗州十一日電〕泰安以一北戰事，十一日已由界延伸至萬德苾村舖一帶，共軍傷亡頗重。膠濟綫龍山方面及黃河北岸桑梓店一帶平靜，惟靑島外圍即墨方面共軍兵力驟增，行動轉緊。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十一日電〕濰縣外圍共軍，昨犯大圩河，小圩河據點，並携大量藥包，岡炸大小圩河鐵路橋樑，當被擊退。坊子濰縣無虞，共軍有向東回竄模樣。濟南東南地區共軍集結達四萬人以上，有三個縱隊番號，不無窺濟企圖。</p>

<h3>平包即可通車</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日日電〕平包通車即可開始，張垣來人談：平綏路破壞之橋七十餘座，即可修好，行車已可恢復正常之速度。平包綫各橋樑旁之七十餘處便道未拆去，藉防共軍隨時破壞橋樑，便道不拆，則不啻雙軌。又包寗綫現已開始測量，修築可期。</p>
<h3>孔祥熙抵青</h3>

<h3>海防艦隊將改組　決成立第一第二兩艦隊　劉存鈞李國嗣分任司令</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島十一日電〕中國海防艦隊將改組為第一·第二兩個艦隊，已發表現任海防艦隊司令劉存鈞為第一艦隊司令。，李國嗣為第二體隊司令，劉刻在京受訓，不日返靑，兩氏將同時就職。劉受訓期間，艦隊調度由第二基地司令　述曾就近代理指揮。至食有南巡任務艦隊，係由海部直接指揮。　艦隊之組織，係海軍組織系統上之重要調整。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十一日電〕海軍界重要人十答記者詢問稱：中國政府如不格於顧慮，可採斷然措施，宣布某一領海區域為綏靖區域，禁止任何船隻出入，事實上，政府早已禁止本國船隻駛往烟·威等區，但對於外船，如基於國際正常友好交誼與諒解，此種禁令殊無必要，衡諸目前情形，倘將禁令發布，我海防艦隊當採斷然行動，或將引起嚴重衝突，但我國當不能負責，刻政府已宣布共黨為叛匪。國內局勢已吿澄淸，至與叛匪合作之國家，已失國際間正常友好之意義，倘發布禁令，則對於澄淸國際局勢，大有關係，然目前尙未至實現時機。</p>
<h3>傷病將士犒賞費　自六月份起調整</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕作戰傷病將士一次犒賞費，原規定負傷將官每員發給十萬元，校官五萬元，尉官三萬元，士兵一萬元，患病官兵照負傷例四分之一發給，自上年九月份起實行以來，已逾半截。陳總長以最近各地物價日趨高昂　特呈請主席，將是項犒賞費自六月份起增為負傷將官發給二十萬元，校官十五萬元，尉官十萬元，士兵五萬元，患病將官發十萬元，校官五萬元，尉官三萬元，士兵一萬元。茲聞主席業已批准，並經國防部通飭各部隊長曁該部各級新聞機構，負責會同辦理。</p>
<h3>陳總長今飛瀋勞軍　代主席舉行授勳　在平曾出席行轅軍事會</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕陳誠總長昨夜在外交大樓聽取保定綏署主任孫連仲及高級將領報吿，至十時半始畢。十一日上午出席北平行轅之軍事會議，李宗仁·孫連仲等皆與會，下午五時在市黨部召集黨團幹部訓話，晚間與下午來平之傅作義晤談。陳總長定十二日飛瀋勞軍，是否去四平·長春，俟到瀋陽後再定。陳氏此行　主席頒獎陳明仁·劉翰東等之勛章，獎章及勞軍品甚多，到達東北後，將代表主席舉行授勛儀式。陳氏十一日接見記有稱：一動員戡亂令頒布後，戡亂工作即可切實進行。過去一年中，我們打的是「黑仗」，不敢徵兵，也不敢徵糧，可以說處處吃虧，所以戡亂工作往往不能依預定進度進行。談及山東戰局稱：國軍在魯已獲得極大成功，中共巢穴之魯南山地即十二　國軍已深入堂握大部，如東里店，南麻皆經收復，南麻一地，即有工廠三處。記者問魯中·魯西戰局對魯南山地戰果有無一影響，陳氏表示，國軍將鞏固已收復之魯南共軍巢穴，至魯中，魯西流突發竄共軍，政府將令調部隊堵擊。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十一日電〕津黨政軍要人綏署副主任上官雲相，第二軍長林偉儔，市長杜建時，黨部代書記長李曜林，十一日赴平參與重要會議。</p>
<h3>東北設兩綏署說杜聿明稱無所聞</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕此間傳陳總長東北之行與調整東北軍事機構有關，並有東北成立兩綏署（由孫立人·鄭洞國分任主任）後，將直籍東北行轅，而撤消東一北保安長官部說。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕杜聿明腿病漸痊，精神轉佳，蓄有短髭，在病榻上接見記者，對東北將設兩綏靖署說，謂尙無所聞</p>
<h3>黃紹竑談話　主張恢復戰時節約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕監察院副院長黃紹竑頃對時局發表意見，謂抗戰勝利之後，本不應立即復員，蓋欲恢復國力，仍需維持戰時之刻苦生活，例如英國即表現此種精神，故今日總動員之實施，不僅有軍事上之意義，且有建國之意義。至於我國經濟上之出路，本人有兩點看法：一為經濟政策應為大多數人打算，少數人之利益應為多數人而受相當限制，但我國目前則為少數之私利妨礙多數之利益。二為戰後浪費太多，應恢復戰時節約。詢以對共黨問題之看法，黃氏表示：因不負軍事責任，對實際形勢不甚瞭解，但自根本上看，如大多數人民之生活得有解決，則共黨勢力必趨消沉。黃氏　為監察院工作，對貫澈總款困難員令關係重大，主張恢復監委巡迦視察辦法。至於提高公務人員待遇，政府除考慮財政負担之能力外，尤須促使社會諒解，蓋此舉勢將增加人民之負担也。</p>
<h3>白德華滯留檀島　蒲立德即來遠東</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美駐華大使館公使白德華，現被阻滯於檀香山，本週末可望抵此。白氏擬於十四日向馬歇爾提出報吿。國務院並無任何象徵顯示即將派遣新大使駐華，以代替司徒雷登。</p>
<p>〔中央社檀香山十日合衆電〕前美國駐蘇大使蒲立德，今在赴華途中經此。渠稱，赴遠東為私人行動，並不代表官方。渠將往中國觀察局勢。</p>
<h3>駁斥虛偽抵賴答覆　我再向外蒙抗議　侵入新疆蒙軍應即撤退</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕外交界息，外蒙政府對於我國關於北塔山事件之抗議，曾於六月二十二日答覆，作種種虛偽抵賴之詞，嗣復於六月廿七日來文，誣我軍於六月十七日有越界射擊之事　。茲悉，外交部已根據事實，於七月八日及十日，電令傅大使（七月十日及十一日）二度以照會向外蒙嚴重抗議。該兩照儕之內容要點為：（一）中國政府在承認外蒙獨立之時，曾宣吿外蒙應以當時之邊界為邊界，其意義係指外蒙在獨立後之邊界，應為外蒙獨立，前經中國中央政府所劃定之外蒙疆界，北塔山係在新疆省內，新疆當局在承認外蒙獨立之前後，均在該地設有警察及地方駐軍崗哨。（二）外蒙軍深入中國境內二百餘公里之地，對北塔山中國駐軍施行攻擊，不得目為普通邊界糾紛。（三）縱令六月五日之事，係導源於所謂「邊界糾紛」，外蒙政府何以不循國際慣例或現時聯合國憲章，以求和平解決，而遽以四十八小時為限之最後通牒，送致當地中國駐軍，隨即動用武裝力量，攻擊該駐軍。此種行為，顯示外蒙政府無尊重國際和平與國際社會所共同信守之規約之意義。（四）自六月六日至六月三十日之期間，續有外蒙武裝部隊越界政擊中國駐軍，並續有飛機侵入中國新疆境偵察轟炸及掃射之事實。（五）中國政府除要求懲兇，保證不再有類似行動及保留要求賠償之要求，外蒙政府立即令飭其侵入新疆之軍隊撤退。</p>
<h3>我照會蘇聯維持原抗議</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕關於北塔山事件，蘇聯政府曾照會我政府，否認蘇機參加。茲悉，我政府對此事曾一再詳査，並已再席照會蘇方，維持我方之原抗議</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕塔斯社今日聲言，蘇聯政府從未反對在旅順大連設立中國行政機構並駐紥中國軍隊，並鄭重否認中國外交部所稱蘇聯反對中國政府前項要求之說。塔斯社並曰，外傳蘇聯諒已允許中共在旅大附近組織軍隊之說，亦屬無稽。</p>
<h3>傅作義抵平談　剿共如捕鼠　軍能擊攻其主力</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕傅作義十一日乘平方往迎飛機，下午五時飛抵平，當晚與陳總長晤談。傅氏對目前軍事局勢，持樂觀能態度，渠吿本報記者稱：目前社會人士應糾正一種錯誤的戰略戰術觀念，社會人士每因共軍之到處流竄，而動搖其對政府軍力之信心，實際上在目前國軍可以打敗共軍的主力和使共軍的力量愈來愈小，却不能根本上使共軍不流竄，例如屋內老鼠，我們雖有幾個人，也不一定能够捉住他，民國以來不說白　會經流竄數千里，就是小如綏遠的土匪楊猴小，也剿了許多年才　淸。傅氏又稱：綏蒙與外蒙邊境尙屬安定，渠不考慮於國境綫上駐兵，渠對國境綫之政策，為以安定求安定，少猜疑，避刺戟。</p>

<h3>十一國遠東委會員宣布　完成對日基本政策　賠償數額我將佔最大部份</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕遠東委員會十一日發表：日「降服後之日本政策」業已究成。此使自日本現行及將來生產中提出賠償，變為可能。此一政策之方式，將以最大數量，給予中國</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕十一國遠東委員會本日通過關於日本投降後對日政策之基本原則。上項政策，係於今年六月十九日獲致決定，而待對日和約生效後始予實施。委員會並根據此項政策，決議之訓令一件，送交東京盟國最高統帥部，以備增訂。一般政策之序文中宣稱：日本在決心全部放棄軍國主義，且願與其他國家在和平中共處，以及在政治經濟及文化生活之各部分，均已建立民主原則之前，不能准其控制其本國之命運。</p>
<p>日本投降後，盟方之「最後目標」，乃（一）保證日本不再成為世界和平及繁榮之威脅，並傳連成立民主和平之政府，俾能履行其國際責任，尊重他國之權利，並支持聯合國之目標，此一政府之建立，須符合日本人民自由發表之意志。</p>
<p>（二）上述目標可藉限制日本主權，於本州，北海道，九州，四國及其他留待決定之外衝島嶼，解除日本武裝，與廢止軍政，鼓勵民主制度，與實施保留工業，以支持其經濟及准予提取公正賠償等項辦法以完成之，而非遵循足使日本重新武裝，從事戰爭之措置。最後將准許日本參加世界商務關係委員會，在「盟國機關」之名義下，反對曾領事將置於美國任命之最高統遇之下，日皇及日本政府，亦應聽命於最高統帥。後者在必要時，得裁撤日本政府各省首長，並任命新人，以補空缺。最高統帥將保護聯合國各會員國在日本之權利與利益，佔領之進程，將向全世界作充分之發表，委員會並訓令積極使日本解除武裝，並廢止軍政。</p>
<p>不准研究軍事</p>
<p>日本將無任何陸海空軍秘密警察組織，或任何民航機構及憲兵，而僅許有適當之民事警察，日本帝國大本營高級官員，以及極端國家主義與軍國主義機構之參謀領袖等，將予以拘捕，幷再作處置，所有戰犯，均應施以嚴格之裁判，其中包括以殘酷手段，施諸聯合國戰俘之罪犯。信仰之自由，將予明令宣布，並將予以保證中欲求個人自由，及民主進步之願望，均將預以鼓勵，凡表現對民族國籍宗敎，或政治主張歧視之法律或條例，均將予以廢除。委實會並訓令日本戰事力量之現存經濟基礎，應予消毀。日本不准生產旨在維持軍事力量或軍事設施之貨物；日本不能從事有且於發展軍事力量之任何研究，日本將根據委會之原則，及波茨坦宣言，將其工業限於保持經濟水凖生活，及標準之限度，其勞工工業，及農業機構，均應根據民去之歷史，不能被相信能指導日本經濟上之努力，以　於和平及民主之目的者，均由最高統帥帥禁止其恢復重要地位。（二）制定關於大工業及銀行聯合之解放，並在更較廣大之管制及所有權之基礎上，代以其他組織之計劃，日本並應供給貨物及勞役，以應盟國佔領軍之需要，其範圍在最高統帥認為不致引起飢饉，疾病蔓延，及身體上之極大痛苦為限，而日本官員之責任，首先在避免劇烈之經濟災禍，次在保證供應品公平而不偏頗之分配。</p>
<p>規定賠償物資</p>
<p>（三）在說明提交賠償時之必要條件。（四）在從事貯備以應日本人民之需要。關於賠償及歸還問題。遠東委會訓令，賠償品將會日本現有資金及設備中提取，並將自現有之日本貨物及將來可以生產之貨物中提取，而上項賠償品，係在遠東委會所定政策下，遵循該會之參考條款時，規定應用以充賠償物資者，各國在日本賠償數額中所獲部分，將在廣泛之基礎上決定之。各要求賠償國家，因日本凖備並進行侵略之結果，在物資生命之毀滅以及所遭之損失，均將計及，而各國對戰敗日本之貢獻，其抵抗日本侵略之程度與時間之長短，亦將計算在內，凡被刧掠，轉移，查抄，或以毫無價值之通貨為抵償之財產，均需予以充分而積極之復原。日本國內財政金融及信用政策，必須經最高統帥批准，在佔領期內，日本將准自外國購買為和平目的所需之原料，且可對外出口，以償付經批准後之進口額，對所有進口出口對外貿易及財務上之交易，均將保持管制。委綢會將制定管理日本進出口之政策，所有聯合國會員國之商務組織，均將獲得對日本貿易及商業之平等機會。日本對所有聯合國家，將予以相同之待遇。最後委員會訓令日本皇家產業，在執行佔領目的必需之行動上，亦不得享受豁免。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本臨時賠償優先實施</h3>
<p>東京麥帥總部。本月九日非正式宣布：日本第一批賠償品，卽將分給中·菲·荷·印·緬甸與馬來，各該國應卽提出申請。賠償品包括機械工具，前兵工廠中之冶金機器，以及人造橡膠設備，皆非日本平時工業所需要。復據華盛頓消息：麥帥宣佈依照「臨時賠償方案」，分配第一批日本賠償品，係麥帥執行遠東委員會之政策麥帥有全權實行，分配中菲等五國，此項賠償品之分配率，中國預定得百分之十五，菲律濱荷印各得百分之五，緬甸與馬來合得百分之五，總計則為整個賠償百分之卅。這是麥帥執行日本臨時賠償方案的迅速措施，這是遠東委員會優先賠償決定成功的先聲。當此整個賠償問題懸而難決的時候，我們對於麥帥此一措施，是應當表示贊同的。</p>
<p>本來，所謂「賠償」，是戰敗國對戰勝國履行的義務，早已存在於國際公法，見之於國際戰爭慣例。關於日本戰敗後的賠償，波茨坦宣言早有規定：「日本可被准許足以維持其經濟並支付公正之實物賠償之工業，但決不包括能藉以武裝再起之工業」。根據這個旨趣，美國在一九四五年十月公佈對日初步政策，規定日本對於其侵略行為之賠償，須採下列方式：（甲）凡在日本所准予保留之領土以外之日本財產，須依照盟國當局之指示，移充賠償之用：（乙）凡非日本和平經濟或供應估領軍所必須之貨物，或現有資本配備，皆應移充賠償。至於日本刦奪之物品，如現在可以査明者，皆應立刻全部歸還。根據美國對日初步政策看來，日本賠償包括了三項原則：（一）日本國外資產，應完全移充賠償，作為抵償該戰勝國賠償的一部份：（二）日本國內資產，除依和平經濟水準保留部份工業外，其餘概充賠償之用：（三）凡屬日本刦奪物品，均應歸還。如果同盟國合作無間，上述原則是不應有疑義的。日本整個賠償問題，不致延宕到今天，仍未解決。</p>
<p>疑義的發生，實為同盟國自身的遺憾。首先關於日本和平經濟水準的保留，美國兩次的報吿書，和遠東委員會保留日本一九三〇至三四年工業水準，無形保謎了日本的現存工業，而削减了日本應充賠償牧資的比重。其次，蘇聯拆遷東北的日本工廠設備和物資，蘇聯認為是「戰利品」，不但不允退回，就是計算在蘇聯已得賠償之內，也不予同意。因此，遠東委員會感覺整個問題難於解決；而中菲各國亟待賠償，以補戰爭期間的鉅大損失，於是自一九四六年五月起，對日本十二項工業，陸續通過了暫准保留額，這就是所謂「臨時賠償方案」；幷依一九四五年十二月之莫斯科決議，規定美國實施「緊急」計劃時，無需徵求遠東委員會同意，並授權麥帥有處理這個方案的全權。盟軍總部接受華府訓令後，開始研究日本軍事工業之拆除，以及應行賠償的種類，麥帥於今年幷提出整個賠償的折衷方案。據美國報道，整個賠償折衷方案，數額僅相當於鮑萊計劃的百分之六十至六十五，美國可獲百分之卅的賠償，中國可取得百分之四十五，蘇聯約得百分之十，但蘇聯獲得日本國內資產，則不逾百分之二。很顯然的，蘇聯是反對這個計劃，幷且它握有遠東委員會的否決權，隨時可以阻礙日本整個賠償計劃。戰勝國自身「放棄」了權利，能不遺慷麽？</p>
<p>中菲各國是受戰爭損失最重的國家，亟待賠償問題解決，且無放棄自身權利之意。因此，遠東委員會乃於今年四月間，權衡輕重緩急，決定臨時賠償方案，應以優先的百分之三十，分配中菲名國。麥帥對於這個優先賠償的處置，手腕靈活，顧慮周詳，於執行此方案之先，以日本軍檻九十二艘，抽籤分配於中英美蘇四國，其第一批三十二艘，於六月廿八日順利完成。緊接着七月力日便宣佈第一批日本賠償品百分之三十，分配於中菲各國。看情勢，如果英蘇無疑義，這百分之三十分配以後，其餘百分之七十就不難成立。因為整個賠償問題的分歧，現在祗是原則之爭。百分之三十的原則優先實行，此後的辦法應該是很順利的了。我們贊同麥帥此一措施，我們主張中國和菲律賓各國，迅速提出申請，早日進等賠償的分配，便是基於這個道理。</p>
<p>臨時賠償辦法百分之三十優先賠償，包括何種物資？數量多少？這些是値得重視的問題。據東京報道：百分之三十優先賠償，如以噸計，為一百五十六萬噸。中國獰優先之半，計七十八萬噸，但尙未確實。至物資種類，為機器工具及兵工設備，大約完全係日本軍事工業之拆除。本來，這些軍事性的重工業，中國獲得以後，對於建設並無大的裨益；但為了防止日本軍國主義的再起，我們也贊同這一次的優先賠償，能早日順利完成，同時希望以此換取得整個日本賠償問題的解決。現在蘇聯對於日本賠償問題，態度相當沉默，而日本國內的怪聲却很多，老議員尾崎行雄對賠償問題，近來也發出狂妄論調。所以設，盟總管制日本政策不能寬縱，而賠償問題尤其不能寬縱。</p>
<p>至於這批賠償物資的處置，技術問題很多，如拆除，船運，倉庫，裝設以及分配，我國行政院賠償委員會，應詳愼規定，並應對賠償物資的種類，提出詳細的計劃。聞政府對於分配，擬以賠償物資之可供民營者，先行價賣，而不採取直接賠償各地公私損失。這個原則是可行的。但提出計劃於麥帥總部時，就必須注意物資的種類，及許多技術上的問題。俟此優先賠償獲得以後，關於整個日本賠償問題，及日本刧奪我國物資的歸還問題，希望我國政府提出具體意見，萬不可事事落後，坐失機先！</p>
<h3>聯合國與世界政府</h3>
<p>我們剛紀念過聯合國憲章誕生兩周年不久，從美國傳來的電訊，郤說有參議員十人向參議院提出議案，主張召開聯合國憲草修正會議，改組聯合國機構，可能剔除蘇聯為會員國。根據此十參議員一的意見，聯合國機構應改組為世界政府，賦予制定，解釋及執行法律之權。如蘇聯不合作，則加以剔除。對於此項報道的傳來，我們並不感到希奇；不過聯合國機構，旣是一種國際組織：似乎不能憑美國參議院的決定而能變更其憲章，且此項提案能否成為決議也還是問題。値得我們注意　是至少美國一部分人士已經感覺到有組織世界政府的必要。這就是說，他們預備將美國一部的主權移轉到一個强有力的國際組織上去。我們猶憶當年召開舊金山會議，擬訂聯合國憲章的時侯，我們中國代表就在大會席上提出移轉一部國家主權的呼號，惜乎這呼號至今還僅是一個理想。我們當然希望聯合國這一國際組織的權力能够加强，但如何加强此一機稱的權力，與其說從修改憲章入手，似母寗就現有的憲章下加强彼此間的合作。憲章僅是一種文件，而應該重視的郤是此一文件所寄的精神。</p>

<h3>歐洲會議今揭幕　捷克中途變卦拒絕參加　蘇聯控制下東歐諸國一律不出席</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕歐洲經濟復興會議，於東西歐分裂形勢下，十二日在法外交部大餐　開幕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社捷克京城十日電〕捷克原已決定接受英法邀請，參加巴黎會議討論馬歇爾計劃，今日突然變卦，證明不能參加，以免被人誤解為反對蘇聯及重歐于諸國。捷克內閣接戈特華特總理自莫斯科以電話及來訓令，遂有此決定，至此，東歐方面蘇聯勢力範圍內各國無一參加巴黎會議，形勢殆已確定。捷克共產黨總理戈特華特昨夜在莫斯科會見史達林總理後，即以電話傳令內聞，匆匆召開緊急會議，討論六小時之久，民族陣綫各黨遂全體一致贊成撤回原議。並即通知英法美三國大使館，聲明捷克「處境」礙難接受英法邀請。據法國外交部宣布，已接波蘭。匈牙利·羅馬尼亞。南斯拉夫·保加利亞·阿爾巴尼亞及芬蘭七國復電，聲明謝絕參加。正式復電接受邀請者則有吳地利·比利時·丹麥·希臘·愛爾蘭·冰島·義大利·盧森堡·挪威·荷蘭·葡萄牙·瑞士·土耳其·捷克及瑞典等十五國，捷克茲已退出，故僅有十四國矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕美國外交官今日宣稱：捷克聲明退出巴黎會議，實爲蘇聯控制東歐各國政府「最粗暴之表現」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：據捷克政界方面稱，蘇聯通知捷克退出巴黎會議之照會不啻「摑捷克共產黨之頰」。緣捷克最初決定參加會議，必先獲得共產黨閣員十人之贊同。惟捷克共黨領袖謂接受邀請一節，事前曾得蘇聯之同意，嗣因得悉其他各國不滿捷克態度，可能因此而修正其態度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播：芬蘭已謝絕英法邀請，決定不參加巴黎會議。莫斯科電台稱：「芬蘭京城方面已宣佈，該國政府昨日全體一致議決拒絕參加巴黎會議」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕莫斯科電台今夜宣稱：阿爾巴尼亞政府業已拒絕應邀出席巴黎會議，以討論馬歇爾之援歐計劃。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎十日電〕美國高級方面九日晩警告稱：十二日在巴黎開幕之歐洲復興會議，將成為歐洲要求美國援助之最後機會，凡目前不參加之國家，以後將無獲得經濟援助之希望。</p>
<h3>英外相飛抵巴黎　將向歐洲會議致開幕辭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：貝文於今夜乘機抵達此間，下機時笑容滿面。又訊：蘇聯實施外交壓力結果，東歐各國均拒絕參加馬歇爾歐洲計劃，至此蘇聯已贏得第一回合。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕官方宣稱：貝文外相將於今晚率英代表團啓程赴巴黎，參加討論馬歇爾計劃之歐洲會議。英外交部發言人謂：關於巴黎會議之進展，當設法通知蘇聯政府。渠指出此一會議，毫無政治性質，故對蘇聯及其他歐洲國家，仍將保持門戶之開放，冀其隨時參加。此間預料貝文向大會致開幕辭時，將强調聲明此次會議之純粹經濟性質。倫敦方面復料至下星期一，建議設立之合作委員會以及糧食農業，燃料電力，鋼鐵及運輸等四小組委員會即可成立。貝文於星期一晚即可返倫敦，由弗蘭克斯爵士領導英代表團參如會議之具體事項討論。隨貝文赴巴黎者有外交部副常務次官巴樞及經濟專家。巴樞將於週一隨貝文返倫敦，其餘繼續留於巴黎參加會議之英代表有外交部經濟司長史蒂文，前駐美大使館經濟參事哈理斯以及財政，商務，糧食，農事，運輸，燃料等部之專家顧問等。盟國賠償管理會主席稱</p>
<h3>歐洲會議討論　德賠償問題</h3>
<p>盟國賠償管理會主席稱</p>
<p>〔路透社布魯塞爾十日電〕盟國賠償管理會主席呂埃夫今日談稱；討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之巴黎會議中，應考慮德國之賠償問題。德國西部之以工業配備作爲賠償，得爲使歐洲從事復典之有力供獻，與巴黎會議所將草具之任何計劃，亦有密切連繫云。</p>
<h3>杜魯們與專家　商美援歐計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕杜魯門總統統於本日午前與經濟諮詢委員會主席諾爾斯暨若干委員舉行會議，討論美國對於歐洲復興問題所能爲者，事後杜魯門總統接見報界，對於拒不接受英法邀請之各國，不願加以評論，僅謂國會領袖定於下星期在白宮舉行會議，討論歐洲流亡人員問題。至於馬歇爾國務卿之援歐計劃以及有關歐洲之若千問題，亦將加以討論。此外余是否前往巴西京城出席泛美會議，此際尙未決定云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕參議院外交委員會定於明日舉行秘密會議，屆時國務卿馬歇爾將發表演說，報吿美國經濟援助歐洲之計劃。</p>
<h3>美國會通過　總統繼承法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕衆議院十日以三六五對十一票，通過總統繼承法案，並送交杜魯門總統批准。根據此項法案，如杜魯門不能完畢總統任期，則將由衆院議長馬丁綱任。</p>
<h3>魯爾煤產問題　英美將開談判</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫郭十日電〕英外部發言人稱，英國已決定接受美政府之邀，派員赴華盛頓與美政府討論魯爾區煤產之問題。英代表人選尙未宣佈，預料將以德境英當局之高級官員及專家担任之。按外次梅秀曾於週一在下院聲明，英國使魯爾煤礦收歸國營之政策並不變更，並日美當局認爲蘇佔領區內之煤礦所有權，在五年以內應交由保管人行使，同時甫赴魯爾區視察之美商長哈立曼聲言美國希望明暸妨碍魯爾煤產增加之原因何在。據此以觀，可見美國之邀英國派員赴美從事會談，當與英美就魯爾煤礦所有權及經濟問題意見未能一致之狀態有關。</p>
<h3>蘇指責西方國家　有分裂德國企圖</h3>
<p>〔合衆社日內瓦十日電〕蘇聯駐捷克大使兼出席聯合國歐洲經濟委員會代表團團長左林頃在該會全體會議席上談稱：西方國家乃欲分裂德國，遠犯波茨坦協定之規定，幷欲阻止德國恢復民主政治，要知處理德國事件，若不將其有關統一之各項問題加以解決，則一切均難圓滿解決云。保與蘇匈訂新貿易協定</p>
<h3>法與比盧簽訂　物物交換協定</h3>

<h3>捷匈訂臨時商約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社捷克京城十日電〕捷克政府今日宣布已與匈牙利簽訂臨時商約。捷克對蘇貿易佔其全部國外貿易百分之十三，其貨物輸往蘇聯者多於自蘇聯輸入之貨物。</p>
<h3>聯合國招貼競賽　加拿大榮獲首獎</h3>
<p>〔聯合國駐滬辦事處成功湖七月十日電〕聯合國舉辦本年度宣傳招貼競賽，業已揭曉，最先三名得獎藝術家爲艾佛萊（加拿大），龐斯（荷蘭），及浦林斯（南非）·獎金第一名美金一千五百元，第二名一千元，第三名五百元。艾氏繪雙手　植一顆樹苗，樹葉爲聯合國各會員國之國旗。林語堂亦爲審查員之一。</p>
<h3>蘇聯或將採取新行動　對抗馬歇爾計劃　東西經濟分裂勢難避免</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕蘇聯今似準備以政治經濟及宣傳等武器，與馬歇爾助歐復興計劃，從事苦戰。歐洲分裂形勢已成，美蘇兩方將作若干次實力考騐。美國務卿馬歇爾今日開始與參院外交委員會進行一連串半秘密會議，並將以其上月五日在哈佛大學同學會所發表之演說爲張本，加强共和民主兩黨一致外交政策，以便應付未來數月之微妙局勢。</p>
<p>美國負責方面以爲蘇聯將隨馬歇爾計劃進展情形，針對其每一部門發動實傳攻勢，並嗾使西歐共產黨同時進攻。法義兩國共產黨且有力運用政治性罷工及其他破壞手段，在討論時阻止其通過，或通過後阻止其實行。另一方面，蘇聯亦有種種困難：（一）蘇聯現已明顯處於反對美國援助歐洲復興之地位。（二）蘇聯控制波蘭捷克等國政府之程度，暴露或嫌過早。（三）蘇聯已使無數人民不得享受援助復興其工商業，反對此種局勢之政治勢力自必强大。（四）蘇聯並已使西歐共產黨在政治上處境兩難。以法國共產黨而論，其將採取莫斯科之反對路綫乎，抑將採取法國政府之贊成路綫乎，如何抉擇，煞費周章。其結果或足使其處境益窘，甚或不免失去勢力。此間外交官員並揣測捷克共產黨總理戈特華特與史達林一談之下，即以非常手段將捷克內閣所決定之外交政策推翻，然則捷克外長馬薩克其將留任乎。</p>
<h3>法公務人員　醖釀大罷工</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十一日電〕巴黎會議開幕前夕，法國面臨歷史上空前大罷工之威脅。</p>
<p>全國一百五十萬公用事業職工代表頃稱：公務人員將發動全面及無限期之罷工，被等在十日深夜繼續秘密研究賴瑪迪之最後解決辦法，直至十一日淸晨四時罷工委員會發表公報稱，「委員會已負責研究政府之建議，頃要求所屬各會員靜候命令保守紀律」。委員會將於下午二時再度集議，會後即將發布其決定。如罷工委會決定罷工，則法國對外一切郵電電話與無綫電交通均將斷絕。法內閣昨晚自九時集議至淸晨一時，今晨九時賴馬迪又召集閣議，謀求解決辦法。　〔合衆社雅典十日電〕希臘公安部長不顧各騷擾區之日益緊張，頃謂雅典城內不致宣佈戒嚴，關於薩朗尼加所傳「國際縱隊」已開入希境，及共黨業已組成新政府之說，總理表示並無所知。希政府雖在左翼各級激烈抨擊之下，十日仍進行大捕共黨陰謀之掃蕩工作。</p>
<h3>史達林打破成例　當夜接見後捷總理　蘇聯對捷克領袖訪問極為重視</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十日電〕史達林元帥於捷克總理戈特華特與外長馬薩克九日到達此間後，即於當夜在克里姆林宮破例加以接見，與之進行會談，蓋史達林以前從未即於當日接見外來貴賓，今打破此成例，因此名人皆認爲蘇聯今極重視捷克領袖之訪問，當時並舉行冗長之會談，但談話內容，則無從探悉。聞捷克總理一行，將於今日與蘇聯領袖賡續進行會談，並悉經濟代表團已在草擬補充商務協定，希望蘇聯以糧食及其他物品，接濟提克。</p>
<h3>聯合國機構成政治戰塲　美蘇兩集團對立　安理會主要議題均未成立協議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖十日電〕此閒若干小國代表及聯合國官員，現正日益恐懼美蘇兩國利用聯合國機構爲　權政策之角逐地，而逐漸毀滅聯合國機構。彼等雖未公開發表此項意見，但在聯合國會議室及走廊間，不難發現此項潛意識之存在，即美蘇兩國同樣犯有以聯合國爲政治戰塲之錯誤。對於原子能管制，普遍裁軍，及巴爾幹問題等，美蘇似僅以槍來刀往之姿態，表演於世界觀衆之前，而絕無協議之企圖。巴爾幹問題在美國堅持之下，正臨「攤牌」階段，已引起各小國之無上焦慮，美國謂聯合國半永久性邊境巡查隊之建議如吿削弱，美國決難接受，而蘇聯代表葛羅米柯對此一建議，似又將使用否決權，果爾，勢將引起西方列强之更激烈之報復。各小國現認為聯合國憲章之精神，已爲美蘇兩國在安理會四次討論巴爾幹問題時屢加破裏，列强如繼續利用聯合國爲政治戰塲，則聯合國終致殘廢云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕安全理會今日議事三起，結果如下：</p>
<p>奧入會申請蘇獨持反對</p>
<p>（一）「奧地利申請入會問題」蘇聯代表葛羅米柯以對奧和約尙未簽訂爲由，表示反對。美代表詹森間接指責對奧和約係被蘇聯躭擱，最後提付表決，以九對零票決定將奧地利之由請列入議程，蘇聯與澳洲葉權。</p>
<p>國際警備軍蘇護提數字</p>
<p>（二）「設立國際警備軍問題」葛羅米柯仍拒絕提出蘇聯方面對警備軍之初步估計數字。美英法三國已於上星期提出，蘇聯認爲應先在原則上決定管辖問題。</p>
<p>（三）「特港行政長官人選問題」亦未成立協議，交由波蘭。澳洲與哥倫比亞三國小組會討論。</p>
<p>阿要求結束聖地委治權</p>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖十日電〕沙地河拉伯十日領導阿拉伯各國提出一項新要求，請聯大會立即給予巴勒斯坦之獨立。沙地阿拉伯駐美公使法奎已正式請求將此項要求，列入九月大會議程，要求聯合國「結束巴勒斯坦之委任統治，幷承認其爲獨立國。我國要求食糧二百萬噸</p>
<h3>國際糧食會議　錢泰演說</h3>
<p>我國要求食糧二百萬噸</p>
<p>〔法國新阻社巴黎十日電〕國際糧食會議本日繼續開會，席間由中國駐法大使錢泰發表演說稱，目下糧食匱乏情形，歸根結底，必須由進口國家增加生產，始能克服。中國目下要求配得之糧食，實已爲最少限度，中國在來年雖尙缺少食米及穀物五百四十萬噸之多，但吾人所要求配得者，則僅一萬噸而已。中國本身之糧食供應情形，雖不能令人滿意，但仍願以黃豆及其他植物油輸往國外，以應他國之需。吾人亟需大量之肥料，尤以台灣需要肥料最殷，因該處淡民均慣於使用肥田粉故也。吾人之生產方法已為戰爭所破報，若能重予利用，當能自給自足。</p>
<h3>美報人一行　自檀香山東飛</h3>
<p>〔聯合社檀香山十日電〕美國報紙雜誌編輯十人，應陸軍部之邀，乘飛機赴遠東考察，今日自此間飛往東京。美國前任駐蘇駐法大使蒲立德亦乘該機而行。據稱，係以私人資格，視察日本·中國。朝鮮及越南現狀，回國後吿知國人。</p>
<h3>蘇聯在管制會議席上　抗議美經濟援奧　指為與盟國協定相抵觸</h3>
<p>〔合眾社維也納十日電〕奧境蘇聯軍事專員柯拉索夫將軍頃在盟管委會例會席上，正式宣讀其聲明書，文長七百言，譴責美國欲藉美奧經濟援助協定之條件，控制奧地利之內部經濟。並謂，此項條件皆與盟國協定相抵觸，故蘇聯主張應加以取消云。</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納十日電〕蘇聯已於今日向盟國管制委員會抗議美國之決定以美元向奧支付佔領費用，美國之計劃爲以美元向奧國購取美軍駐奧所需之奧幣許令。美國務院指出此舉，可使在和約生效以前，即减少佔領之負担，奧國因此而擭得之美元，將有助於其經濟之復興。據本社外交記者稱，倫敦方面對於蘇聯此一抗議，甚感驚異，對其抗議所據之理由亦尙未明暸。美國之計劃已於七月一日起實行，奧政府對之甚爲歡迎，奧內長且已籲請英法蘇三其他佔領國，採取同一步驟。英國之立塲乃爲英政府雖極願採取同一步驟，惟以英國本身財政困難，故不免有力不從心之感。</p>

<h3>「假鳳虛凰」試映風波　理髮師封鎖大光明　李麗華石揮扮鬼臉　來賓遭無妄之災肇事一人官裏去</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕石揮李麗華主演之「假鳳虛凰」，最近由文華影片公司拍攝完成，昨晨十時假大光明戲院試映。公司方面事前宜傳已久，並發出請柬甚多，故昨晨雖天氣炎熱，但前往觀劇者，仍踴躍異常，不下千餘人。</p>
<p>詎觀衆絡繹前往之際，大光明戲院竟為本市理髮業職工會會員及同業公會會員八百餘人所包圍。所有入口處亦均被派員把守，凡遇觀衆持柬入塲，俱遭阻擋門外。一時觀衆莫明所以，如墮五里霧中。</p>
<p>此次所以引起理髮業會員之不滿者，原因為該片喜劇性之劇情中，有描寫理髪師石揮逢新寡文君徵婚，化裝自稱華僑　室，前往應徵一段，致理髮業方面認為諷刺，大不謂然。並對石揮用蘇北口音說聲「乖乖」，及求婚時擬用剃刀自殺等等鏡頭，極感不滿。</p>
<h3>上海市兵役協會議決　安家費每名四百萬元　公推潘公展繼任主委</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市兵役協會，昨午三時，在市政府大禮堂舉行首次會議，由議長潘公展主席，出席吳國楨·杜月笙·方治·張曉崧·徐寄　·王先青等十餘人，決議事項如下：（一）主任委員杜月笙因病請辭，公推潘公展為主任委員。（二）推選方治·杜月笙·王先青為常務理事。（三）決議每三個月舉行常會一次。（四）推定王先靑·張曉崧負責草擬兵役協會之辦事細則。（五）決議本市應征壯丁法，交常務委員會擬定。（六）籌辦本市征屬工廠案，原則通過。（七）緩征召壯丁繳納優待余暫行辦法，決重行擬訂。</p>
<p>擁集門前·散髪傳單</p>
<p>該會曾在一週之前，提出幾點意見，要求改正。一度並曾向社會局要求制止該片上演，未得要領。迨昨晨聞悉該片正式試演消息後，遂齊集全市理髮業會員擁集大光明門前，極力阻撓開演。同時並散發「敬吿本市各界仕女書」，歷述反對理由八項四條。</p>
<p>當時公司方面以事出倉卒，雖與職工代表幾經解釋，終因人多嘴雜，一無結果。且因一部份理髮師情緖激昻，致有一名繆觀慶之粵籍學生，因不知裏情，堅欲入塲觀劇，為把守大門之理髮業會員數人毆傷。此時新成警局聞訊，早經派有大批警士前來維特秩序，迨見發生毆打事件，遂當塲捕獲兇手杭榮坤一名（卅四歲揚州人，住愚園路二五五號）。</p>
<p>木牌高掛·暫停試映</p>
<p>事情演變至此，已至不可收拾地步，而一般應邀前　觀劇之來賓，深恐遭殃，大半紛紛散去。同時警局方面為恐事態擴大，乃　吿公司方面暫吿停映，經各方商談結果，掛出「談判未妥，暫停試映」之木牌一塊。理髮業工會會員以目的已達，遂亦逐漸散去，時已十一時許矣。</p>
<p>廣告牌上·面目全非</p>
<p>惟理髮師一面在大光明阻撓開演之時，一部份理髮師則　扶梯携各色漆桶，先後在仙樂斯附近及黃坡路口之廣吿路牌上，將所有「假鳳虛凰」之廣吿畫，如數塗以紅藍白三種油漆。石揮與李麗華之面部，均為紅白漆抹得十分難着，以致「面目全非」。主演者李麗華及黃佐臨之名字下，並畫有小烏龜一隻。</p>
<p>又當大光明門前緊張之際，石揮亦曾在塲，後睹事態惡化，乃避入卡爾登內，與黎明暉等靜候發展，結果終因「談判未妥」，廢然而返。</p>
<h3>新麗琴接到一封怪信　美國花旦自殺之謎　哄動全滬平劇界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨夜本市平劇界盛傳「美國花且」華達（見圖）在蘇自殺，致引起各戲院後台譏論紛紛，咸為之嘆惜不止。此事乏發生經過，頗為曲折離奇，可稱週來自殺案中　當有戲劇性者。</p>
<p>首先傳出此項消患　，為現在中國大戲院演唱花且之新麗琴。蓋新　琴於昨晨接獲一信，署名金妙生。信中謂華達在蘇，遺失價値二三千萬之鑽戒一枚，因遍尋無着，吞服安眠藥片後跳井自殺。由蘇州友好為其料理後事用去治喪費三四千萬元，並　業已安葬五日之久矣。　當時新麗琴即將此信交友人傳觀，致一時平劇界中人咸為之驚愕不止嗣經與華交好者細加分析，忽發現此中顯然別有隱情，蓋研究此信筆跡，以及經過情形，頗多矛盾不合理之處，故斷定信為偽造無疑。因平劇中界並無金妙生其名，而僅有金妙聲其人，蓋金藝著名之青衣也。由此推測，寫信者意在</p>
<p>再經研究，發現華達係於星期一前往蘇州，而新麗琴所接獲之信，係星期三所寫，星期四寄出，昨晨始接到，故對信中所謂業已安葬五天之說，顯然不符。</p>
<p>再金妙聲現在北平，最近曾匯來家用一百萬元可作明證故最後對字跡細加硏究，忽發現筆跡與華達本人所書者無異，因而此事，更覺撲朔迷　。如果此信確係華所書，則推測華達寫此信時之心理，或係因不滿金妙聲，而有此惡作劇或另有用意也。聞華達最近自資島　戲返滬時，曾謂金妙聲在靑與其「吃鬥」，故頗表不滿，而於日前怏怏不樂赴蘇小遍　。</p>
<p>當事出之初，其母聞之，惶急萬狀，迨後知其為偽，始稍放心，故昨夜記者往訪華母於寓時，終於破涕為笑，欣然送出門外，連呼「對不起，多承關注」不已。　按華達現年廿二歲，為混血兒，故有「美國花旦」之名。五年前曾拜王瑤卿之徒本市名票黃靜波為師，訂有八年「關書」，涇黃盡心指導，學成名劇十餘齣。</p>
<h3>合包工程遭人獨佔　父死子又溺斃　叔侄被控謀害</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕荀鶴年，荀百計叔侄二人昨被婦人　劉劉氏等向地檢處控吿謀財害命。據訴狀中所述事實如下：劉慶記主人劉阿慶，（住浙江南路寳裕里二十一號），承包和豐造船廠鋒銹工程。劉於一月間因資金週轉不靈，邀其友人荀鶴年，荀百計（住北四川路公益坊廿二號）叔侄兩人參加，為承包工程經濟後台。劉阿慶於二月間突患病逝世，荀鶴年叔侄二人，竟乘機將劉慶記重要錀匙圖記竊佔應用，並將劉慶記改為荀鶴記，獨佔營業。同時荀又制止和豐造船廠付款與死者之子劉志富，經劉志富向船廠大班交涉，荀即約志富於上月二十七日過江前往該廠領款。詎志富出們以後，即告失蹤。隔兩日後其屍身浮於黃浦江面，其母劉劉氏，妻邱氏，姊劉巧雲，於非慟之餘，以荀氏叔侄涉有重大嫌疑，聯名向地檢處控訴。</p>
<h3>四示範郵局　定今晨開放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市思南路，靜安寺，福建路，提籃橋四郵政支局，現由管理局指定為示範局，曾將營業處及一切設備大事刷新，重新佈置，服務人員一律穿着制服。</p>
<h3>仙樂一舞客被捕　姜公美案中有關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕仙樂舞　九日晚，曾有舞客一名被捕，據悉名曾月明，江蘇人，現年四十，因與業經伏法之前上海憲兵隊長姜公美貪汚案有關，經當局下令通緝。曾於本市淪陷期內任職偽警局股員，勝利後即被姜公美羅致，充任要職，直至姜被捕，始潛逃赴港，最近因認姜案已吿段落，故又潛返本市，不時也入各舞塲，卒為當局偵悉拘獲。</p>
<h3>十八家民營電台　同等待遇難照準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議會以前據中華自由電合十八家民營電台請求與其他電台同樣待遇案，特轉函交通部核辦。茲據交部復稱：「所請每一電台得用一個週率一節，因週率數目有限，碍難照准，如該台等因各置機件，間日輪流播昔，工作人員及國家捐稅，均不能减半，而難於維特，則可由各該台自行治商，每兩台合用同一機件，經報由本部核准後，可准予逐日播音，籍資筋省」。</p>
<h3>蠶眠中的造幣廠　當年全國財富吐納地　而今敗如式微世家</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕經過十年滄桑的中央造幣廠，好比一個式微的世家，門庭冷落，殘破不堪，使人有不勝今昔之感了　十多年以前，當幣制尙未改革，銀本位實行的時候，它是全國財富的吐納地。一塊塊的銀元角子，從它幾十部機器裏鑄出來，流通到民間。那時候它擁有六百多個工人，整日機聲隆隆，緊張異常。曾幾何時，幣制改革，紙幣發行以後，從此衰落。再經過八年抗戰，廠址被敵人佔據，熔製工塲淪為馬廄，機器拆的拆，燬的燬，到勝利接收時平已面目全非。雖然如此，到底還保持着世家的門面。從造幣廠橋下望，就看見它週圍八十多畝的廠址。走進鐵門，兩蒂是草坪，中間那座江海關式的三層建築，仍能使人體味出它昔日的聲勢。</p>
<p>由該廠陸處長的引導，還有幾位老職員陪着我們參觀各個部門，一一加以說明，眞好像是「白頭宮女談天寳」，令人感慨無窮。</p>
<p>我們走進Ｕ字形的工塲。首先是一間磅稱間墻垣灰暗，塵埃滿室。有兩架可以秤一噸重的磅秤，靜靜地安放着，左邊角洛裏原是可稱重幾噸的地秤，現在祗剩了一個窟窿。另一邊則是一扇拆下的已經銹毀的庫房門。這種庫房門原是外洋的特製品，用法與銀行的保管庫庫門相同，廿六年抗戰起時，拆下後本擬移運內地，可惜因為時間不及，就此堆在倉庫裏毀壞了。現在的庫門還是日本人裝的鐵板門，因為在淪陷期問他們曾把造幣廠作為車火倉庫。</p>
<p>熔爐四十剩了四座</p>
<p>從磅秤間進去就是熔煉工塲，看上去感覺得一番殘敗氣象，室中央兩道深約呎餘地溝，原為裝煤氣管子的，現已蕩然無存。原來四十座溶爐祗剩了四座，而且還是修理後燒柴油的。溶煉工塲左手是保管庫，庫門亦已拆燬。裏面放着三十多萬兩每塊一千多兩的銀塊，那是中央銀行在勝利以後接收敵偽產業所得的散銀，委託廠中溶塊化騐成份的。保管庫對面Ｕ字形轉灣過去是軋鑄工塲，原有十幾部軋片機祗剩了三部。烘片間裏機器則已全部拆光。再折入鍋爐間，但見鐵門緊鎖，牆上還有日文「當値室」的痕跡，三架鍋　祗餘殘焦的二架。</p>
<p>水塔四周　茂草沒脛</p>
<p>鍋　間外邊空地上有高大的水塔，曾被機關槍射得彈痕累累。現已修復，週圍茂草沒脛。像游泳池一般的鍋鑪換水池中，噴水管亦早已拆除。另一邊是頗像防空洞般的地道，通到Ｕ字形中間的工人浴室。原來當年廠方為防止工人偷竊，凡一天工作完畢後，都要到浴室去沐浴，脫下的衣服，被詳細檢査後，始准離廠，這地道便是浴後出廠的道路。地道長約三丈餘，戰時曾被日人用作防空洞，直到現在地道另一邊出口處前面還有一塊鐵板擋着。Ｕ字形工塲的另一邊，大部份現在被海軍當局所借用，堆置廢棄的魚雷等軍火。小部份由廠方當作物料儲藏庫，放着大天秤四座，小天秤十二座，印花機兩架。印花機是產生銀幣的最後一架機器，高約六英呎，形狀有點像「吃角子老虎」。冷淸的放在角落裏，它若有　。回想昔日吐出一塊塊銀洋的盛况，也當自悲身世了。</p>
<p>兼製銅片　賴以維持</p>
<p>這樣一個龐大的工廠，破壞到如此地步，如果要恢復到原狀，估計需要三百萬至四百萬美金，道眞是談何容易，何况硬幣時代早已過去。那末我們要問，中央造幣廠現在究竟做些什麼工作呢？從民國二十一年開始，造幣廠開始鑄造銀圓，其初岡案為帆船上有三只飛鳥，下有一個太陽，可是這樣圖案的銀元所鑄極少，便奉命將圖案上之飛鳥及太陽取銷。幣制改革以後，仍製造輔幣。迨抗戰發生，先後在武昌成都桂林昆明蘭州五地設立分廠，鎔化雜銀黃金。勝利後各地分廠撤銷，現在總廠的工作仍是代央行熔化雜銀黃金，代敵產處理局熔燬銅元制錢。同時以所餘機力人力，兼營製造銅片（作熱水壼壳等用）之副業，維持一百多員工之生活。</p>
<p>開鑄硬幣　全是謠言</p>
<p>最近外間曾傳中央造幣廠已在開始替政府製造硬幣，其實完全是謠言。其起因或者由於中央銀行為淸理小票，有大批鈔票箱，因無處堆存，借造幣廠的一間廠房另搭一間草棚存放。這種鈔票箱子的形狀與從前裝五千元一箱銀幣的木箱，完全相同。中央銀行一批批的把箱子運至造幣廠，外界的謠言因此就不脛而走了。不過無論如何，浩幣廠雖然經過十年滾桑，政府始終保持着它的規模，和員工，我們可以預料這式微的世家，終有中興的一天，雖然道一天不知在何年何月。　〔本報訊」中庸洋行經營黑市金鈔，擾亂金融一案，昨地檢處傳該行經理愛司加登，會計錢孟初偵訊。昨日調査要點有三：（一）中庸洋行有無經營銀行業務情事。（二）自二月十七日，國府頒佈經濟緊急揹施方案以後，該行收付款項，是否以法幣為單位。（三）經濟緊急措施方案頒佈以後，該行付出及收進美金幾何。據愛司加登供稱：該行共有經理三人，係共同負責，渠不能一人單獨負此責任。庭上以賬目方面尙須再予審査，論知被吿仍交原保，改期再訊。</p>
<h3>計口配油取消</h3>
<p>食油煤球專配各廠工人</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中央銀行張總裁在私邸召集有關各機關，商討本市一般配售問題。決定計口配油取消，改為專配廠工，每人每月二斤，配價每斤四千五百元。同時並對工人配售煤球，由燃管會供給社會局白烘屑，再由社會局處予各煤球廠製造煤球後，配予工人，每月一担，價格尙未決定，但總可較市上為廉，其配售辦法相同於配米。凡各廠工人申請配米已經核准者，皆得享受配售食油及煤球之權利。</p>

<h3>社局召各業談話　商棧單交易限期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕為擬訂限制棧單交易辦法事，社會局於昨日上下午，分別召集食油豆餅米糧燃料等業負責人談話。（一）油業方面出席廠商代表胡燕，油商及豆餅業代表張超，經商定食油棧單，仍照過去規定，期限不得超過十天。豆餅業因每年四月十五日至九月十五日為交易旺盛時期，經商定存棧期限最長不得超過一個月。（二）米糧方面出席碾米廠代表江澄慶，米商代表楊式舫，雜糧商代表邢志剛，因食米現今皆為現貨交易，並無棧單，故無從限制期限。（三）燃料業方面表示，目前當局希望本市每月存煤二十萬噸，並獎勵白煤進口，故如貿然限制棧單交易，將影響燃料之輸入，社會局表示對此允予考慮。</p>
<h3>法租界華員請願　退職金問題解決</h3>

<h3>羣聲過不了五關（下）　球迷無聯大賭勝負</h3>
<p>有些觀衆，對羣聲這一些舉動，大為不滿，爭執時一直呌駡嚷打，菓層雜物亂擲羣聲隊員，比賽終止後，又圍擁住羣聲隊員不離塲，有的簡直就向前衝，幸得在塲童軍極力維持秩序，最後並由星聯隊員護送離塲，方未發生意外，但被困於塲內已達一小時之久了。平心而論，此次不偷快事件之發生，羣聲隊員隨便當塲抗議之壞習慣，與不顧體育精神，固應譴責，但親衆之興波作浪，無理呌囂，亦不能辭其咎。同時因為兩地的裁判習慣，有所不同，容易引起誤會，難免也是引致糾紛的原因之一。談起觀衆之無理呌囂，眞屬無聊、星洲有極多球迷與外地相同，不只迷球而且迷賭，或賭球險之勝負，或賭進球多寡，向來籃球沒有足球貽得兇，但此番羣聲征星，球隊好，賭迷無形活躍，第一戰對混合隊時，即有人以羣聲必勝十八分以上而下賭注叻幣五千元，（相當於國幣五千萬以上）結果羣聲只勝十三分，賭迷們大輸一塲。此次羣聲對星聯，棋逢敵手，賭的尤為起勁，每進一球輸贏可達五十元，因是看賽球竟如看賽馬，一起爭執，首先呌囂騷動者，多半為這一批人。球賽是在快樂世界遊藝塲體育館舉行，為全馬最好之籃球房，全部水門汀竊築，座位可容一萬人，我雖不敢說一萬人，都在亂泮嚷·但縱僅有半數，亦已够「熟鬧」了。　國內評論說羣聲於打敗或打平手時亦會慌張，這話說得最對，他們這次之所以失態，完全與打敗有關。過去幾塲球，陳金德陳金置蔡文章，亦曾數度當塲抗議，但當時他們恒佔上風，明知必勝，故抗議無效，亦只一笑了事，這次情形不同，第四節開始時還輸六分，於是抗議無效，就不干休，而至索性不打，但是羣聲為什麽會輸？這除了「演出失常」和「強中自有强中手」外，難以解釋，誠然羣聲隊員之個人技術高超，進攻之花樣亦多，但却失之於防守疏弱，他們打慣五攻五守，攻得快，却守得慢，這如遇着攻勢弱的對手，當不成間題，但遇着星聯可糟了糕。當晚星聯有很多球妙傳至籃底，而進得清脆，便是明顯的例子。羣聲此戰，除文華金置各得十四分外，其餘都失常，球怪蔡文章一向以「掛分」聞各，竟只得三分，一籌莫展。不過，話雖這樣說，假使羣聲在第二節不輸得太「一面倒」，這塲結局，勝負也許還很難分的。試看下面的詳細積分表，第一節十二－七菲勝，第二節三－十七星勝，第三節十五－十二，菲勝，第四節十一－十，菲勝，總計四十一比四十六，菲敗。羣聲輸了，但後面還有兩塲球，很多人祖心這次弄出不愉快之事，羣聲亦許不會再打，但據今天確實的消息，羣聲已決照原定程序繼續進行，主辦此次球賽之中華體育促進會以前車可鑒，亦決由該會會長吳再興，及星洲第一流籃球指導陳詩水，親任裁判。這最後二賽，守關的是檳城隊和馬華聯隊，雖然都是很堅强的隊伍，但羣聲如勿失常，相信終不會一敗再敗，無論如何，輿論界却都勉勸雙方勿把勝負放在心裘，尤其熱望羣聲隊好好打一塲，庶幾挽回失去的聲譽。（六月廿五日中央社記者蔡柏靑寄）</p>

<h3>華股升沉互見　北幫紗幫出籠</h3>
<p>華股昨初俏虛疲，中途倍形恍惚，交易有限，信和仍見生氣勃勃，景福新光亦時露雄岡。惜銀根甚緊，永紗不久復吿頹廢，終露鬆弛之象。塲外貼息，永紗仍需三角六至四角〇五，而小型股則開二角二分半至二角七，新買無意活動，北幫紗帮出籠較多，證券大戶及廣帮之買進，僅不過略事點綴而已。結局升沉互見，晨開時以隔前國行交換差出而開高盤。開後遞永紗自一一二〇元起，由二二四號二二三號九四號賣到一九九七〇元。一七七號一四三號雖進，不過在一一〇〇〇元左右稍事掙扎而已。二一八號一四九號一五二號八五號供給，退至一〇八〇〇元。一七七號一四號二三一號尙進至一一〇〇〇元外，二一八號一一七號一五三號九四號六九號賣意甚切，而將遞永紗迫低至一〇六二〇元低價。遞信和亦由一五七號一〇四號一六五號等力售，而降至四三五〇元以內。八九號一六三號一五四號一〇四號趁低來進，稍形拉上，盤旋至十一時三十分，始有　動。信和由二三號二三二號八四號一〇四號八五號等進至四五五〇元左右，永紗復由一五二號五四號一五五號二二三號二三四四號二三一號二一五號二四號一〇二號一一六號等之買胃加强，十二時一刻，銀根大鬆，曾再穿出一一〇〇〇元外。遞景福在大衆追逐之下，躍升至一八九元高價，塲外開息甚昂，散買之哄抬，不過予股市之回頭加速而已，七一號二三一號一八五號四五號均加了結，迫於時間之浮多，亦加爭售，永紗首先回瀉，信和新光亦被帶小，最後遞永紗以一〇七〇〇元，即交永紗以一〇三〇〇元結束。收後遞永紗喊一〇七五〇元左右，結果較前收現交各股計新光信和美亞動典新華微升，永紗華麗尙平，中法永公景　稍降，商務國貨跌半成，麗安升半成，縈綸水泥平平。遞交各股計新光美亞尙平，縈福信和華　　升，永紗永公勤興小挫。塲外各老股除世界仍難扳停外，餘再見　少許。</p>

<h3>統債續挫外股平庸</h3>
<p>公使昨賡續下挫，過程平淡，銀根見緊。統丙晨開六千七，寳隆及五〇三室賣出，五三三室雖進，仍吿步降至六千三左右結束。成交約一百萬左右，結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各小二百元，統丙再跌五百元。</p>
<p>外股雖形軟化，但過程平庸逾恒，廣幫雖買，北幫證券帮及銀行方面稍加出籠，業外刺激性，反吿助賣，怡紗自晨開七九五〇〇元，降至七七五〇〇元結束，結果較前收計鋼業獨降半成外，餘股均吿微挫。</p>

<h3>紡調會主委談　會務推進概況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會主委鄒秉文，昨日接見記者時，就訪調會會務推進概况，舉其犖犖大者一，為記者縷述祥精。茲分誌如次：（一）棉紗價格，自紡調會成立後，即確立議價制度。對紗價就其實際生產成本，加合法利潤後評議合理價格。同時按照實際情形，採取彈性譏價制度。故今後紗價之趨向，可望走上正軌途徑。（二）行總四，五，六，三個月中所供給各紗廠之棉花六萬餘包，產紗約三萬餘件，已決定全部由紡調會按廿支紗每件六百五十萬元之價格，即日開始收購。紡調會已於昨日與國行訂立一千五百億元之透支契約，以備收購該批棉紗之需。（三）第六區棉紡公會所屬各廠，提供共同配銷之棉紗一萬件，刻已交到預約單棉紗八〇三二件，本會已分枇撥交中國紡建公司，代為配銷。（四）自第二季限　外棉起，政府將全部採行代一紡代織政策。估計在六個月中，十政府可掌握國民營各紗廠產紗量百分之七十，尚餘百分之三十產紗量，政府藉調簡紗布施策，將加以約束。故政府對紗布之前途，有充份把握，使其發展平穩。又據鄒氏語記者：渠原任聯合國晨業糧食組織，執行委員，本應常川駐美京華盛頓辦公。此次為籌劃紡調會事應召返國，刻農糧組織，已定於本年八月二十三日起，在日內瓦舉行第三屆年會。會期前後須三星期，並定於八月十六日起，光開始舉行籌備會議。故渠須即日飛美，料理農糧組織公務。紡調會主委一職，在出國期間，將由副主委童季齡暫代。惟童氏現亦滯留日內瓦，在童氏返國前，主委將由紡調會委員曁經濟部代理常次劉　英暫代云。</p>
<h3>營業稅期限屆滿後　糧商請繼續免徵　決組織請願團赴京呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖贛四省及京滬兩市糧商公會，於昨日中午十二時，　讀假靑年會舉行聯席會議。對政府免征全國糧商營業稅期限，即將於本年十月底屆滿一案，仍繼續討論。各地出席代表，以糧商在戰時損失綦重，而糧食又為一般人民之必需品，征稅結果，對一般貧民增加負担尤甚。基此理由，要求政府於期限屆滿後，繼續豁免營業稅。當決定組織四省兩市糧商請願團，推王桐生張超等十餘人為代表，於今晚晋京，分向行政立法兩院，經財糧三部請願。並定於十三日在京招待新聞界，報吿請願目的。最後通過浙省代表王桐生臨時動議，籌組全國糧商公會聯合會，四省兩市糧商公會為當然發起人，即日起開始推進籌備工作云。</p>
<p>去化清懈食米略升</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千六百石左右，店方零華有動，市塲交易尙可。早市開盤上漲，午時轉疲，結果粳秈米較昨軋升一二萬元，但去華甚懈，形成盤旋之局。</p>
<p>麵粉先漲後回，無甚榮辱，形勢略呈緊俏。洋粉微升一二千元，麩皮廠方不開，貨主堅挺，回漲二千元。　豆阱實銷淸淡，市面平正，營口餅客消不動，步跌三四千元。黃豆汕幫進取尙濃，挺進三五千元。菉豆南洋續辦，按步上漲，盤升萬元。赤豆亦然跟漲三五千元，蠶豆去化平常，價格疲軟，紅糧平庸，苞米少神。生仁再低三五千元。</p>
<p>芝蔴貨稀獨挺，莞豆彷彿，小麥堅挺，市形看緊，缸豆穩固。油市廣方猛吸，菜油暴漲三四萬元，豆油隨之帶升萬元，淸油貨稀加一二萬元。蔴油平正，惟生油來貨尙接，回疲萬元，形勢則漲跌互見。</p>
<p>洋米兩批即可到滬</p>
<p>〔本訊〕中信局向緬甸听訂購之洋米，上月廿八日，自仰光由昌興惠民兩輪，裝出食米一萬二千餘噸，估計可於本月中旬到滬。又該局向美國及南美巴西　，厄瓜多爾等地所訂購之洋米約十萬噸，可望於本年八月底前，一全部裝華。</p>
<p>該局對日易貨人造絲一批，數額不詳，亦可於月內裝滬。</p>
<h3>出口貨水險保費及運費等　可先行結匯再作事後審核</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行非進口貨外匯申請審核委員會，自開始工作以來，迄已審核自費留學生之申請案件三百餘起，商人出口水險旅行等費案件三十餘起，經該會作初步之審核後，將於日內彙轉行政院外匯審核委員會，提交該會下週四例會時作最後之核定。</p>

<h3>中國農民銀行限期歸還　卅五年度茶商押款　本年份茶產綠茶可佔多數</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行以三十五年度茶葉押款，本月已絡續到期，而各茶商迄今尙有大部份未將押茶　回，統計尙有一百七十億元押款未曾收回。現中信局已奉令收購新茶，並可予商人以合法利潤，故晨行刻限期各茶商，將押茶售於中信局，俾歸還押款。</p>
<p>又據該行負責人談稱：自中信局奉令宣佈收購茶葉後，近日各茶晨茶商做茶已較前踴躍，迄目前止，本年度箱茶已有二千箱運滬。該批箱茶經該行評議後，認為品質較往年為佳，並無陳茶參雜，此足證茶商在茶葉有銷路陸，其茶產品質亦可改良，藉廣外銷。又最近紅茶已收完，僅綠茶尙有一部份可收，預料本年度茶產，綠茶將多於紅茶云。</p>
<p>外銷茶葉求過於供</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，向銷非洲摩洛哥之抽珍，珍眉等綠茶，買戶雖仍接踵而來，但以上項花色，自日前由永興同孚兩洋行，及午昌等茶葉公司搜求後，市上存底漸轉枯竭。且加以執貨者售意趨堅，致市勢頗呈有求乏供之象，交易未免凋零，行情則益露鋒芒。至於各種內銷茶，去化依然蟬聯，其中尤以毛紅茶，楓涇嘉善一帶需求愈切，售價方面均極俏利，前途續在看漲之中。</p>
<h3>糖價一致勝昂</h3>
<p>昨糖市台糖俱已漲足，土糖中靑赤白亦跟蹤上展，公會劃盤，現貨秘魯砂為七十二萬五千元至七十二萬元，現貨二〇中砂白初為七十萬元，旋即回至六十九萬五千元及六十八萬元。二四粗白七十八萬元。四半車白六十九萬五千元至六十九萬元。台赤六十三萬元。汕提青高貨四十八萬元，次之四十六萬五千元。棉赤五十二萬元，次之四十八萬元，計百餘包。海南赤高貨四十八萬元，次之四十七萬元至四十五萬元。普通四十一萬五千元，計二百數十包。興化白高貨六十二三萬元，興赤四十八萬至四十七五萬元，計二百　弱。刁靑僅數十包交易，高貨四十三萬元至四十三萬五千元。</p>

<h3>已到滬不準進海關重訂處理辦法　限期轉運外洋或予放棄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關頃以報關人對不准進口貨物，常多積壓，不予設法轉運，現特揭示第一三九號公吿，另訂處理辦法。該公吿略稱：查自上年三月一日暫行進出口貿易辦法，曁上年十一月十七日修正暫行進出口貿易辦法，以及政府限制某項指定物品進口辦法實施以來，到滬貨物，每有因不能呈騐進口許可證，或有違政府限制進口辦法經關不准進口者，該項不准進口貨物，如無違犯海關緝私條例情事，得准轉運外洋，惟報關人多不即設法轉運，致未了案件積壓甚多。</p>
<p>茲規定凡以前積壓之不准進口貨物，應即轉存關棧，或予放棄　，交由海關處理，否則應於本布吿之日起，四十天內轉運外洋。　嗣後如遇不准進口貨物應改存關棧，或予放棄，或受貨人或其代理報關人，於收到海關通知該貨照章不能進口之日起，四十天內轉遝外洋。如將貨物聲明放棄者，所有堆存貨棧之應納棧租，仍應由報關人負責繳付。如報關人對於以上規定，不切實　辦，本關對於該報關行呈遞之新報單一，不論報運何項貨物，於積案未一辦理完竣前，將不予接受。</p>

<h3>人造絲堅挺</h3>
<p>人造絲終因存貨日枯，昨市又呈堅挺。一二〇號高山有光，開盤價喊三千〇七十萬元，但實銷戶大都持觀望態度，乏人過問，以致旋即下降。中午收盤已退做三千〇二十萬元，下午隔日期喊大二十萬元，最後仍為三千〇四十萬元。一五〇號有光去路較少，市價反短於一二〇號有光，可謂時過境遷而異。</p>
<p>廠經因求過於供，且實銷清淡，連朝堅持，昨市成交價已呈疲軟。做開Ｃ字等級一檔，價三千三百五十萬元。有開天期頭，高一級零担二百五十萬及七十萬均有</p>
<h3>粗紗市氣步秀</h3>
<p>棉紗市况，晨開因需朮見遜，市價微挫，迨至收時，塲內有見低搜吸，長江幫進取亦殷，尤以二十支為最。結果二十支特雙馬昂至一千二百五十萬，雙馬紗為一千一百五十萬，比上日俱升二十萬元。藍鳳天女人鐘等牌亦升十萬至十五萬元，十六支光明天女紅蜂軋升五至十萬，惟細紗卅二支藍鳳銀月反降卅萬至六十萬元，四十二支紗平定。</p>
<p>紡建配紗</p>

<h3>長春一角　四面邊聲連角起　長煙落日孤城閉</h3>
<p>— 三日長春航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>長春危困一月，並不如外間想像得那末緊張，現在長春有實力强大的國軍，不僅能守，且能出擊，目下國軍長南挺進兵團正已馳解四平之圍，可作一個強有力的證明。</p>
<p>但是，此次東北局面的激蕩，是國軍接收東北以來最激劇的情勢。一般人在心理上受了很大的威脅，特別是關內來的人，恐懼動搖了他們的信念。聽說瀋陽逃難的人很多，有錢的人，一聞概號，就收拾細軟，乘「機」南飛；在長春，準備逃難的人不是沒有，是沒有來得及逃。眼看這種令人痛心的現象，記者實不敢緘默。</p>
<p>這一個月來，憂鬱在人的心頭打結，生活龍罩在陰沉的氣氛中。六月十三日，小豐滿長春輸電綫彼破壕，全城大部陷於黑暗。火力發出有限的電量，只能照明一部份重要機關。停電沒有水，主婦們天天爲此傷腦筋。自來水不來，許多大建築的便所散發着令人作嘔的臭氣，六十萬市民只得暫用艱貴而不淸潔的井水。</p>
<p>市內電車也因停電而停駛，長市沒有公共汽車，這唯一平民化的交通工具的中　，「行」成了大問題。市郊有幾個大機關，是新聞來源地，記者因停電關係，也只好减少去的次數，來去馬車費流通券一千元，合法幣一萬二千五百元。在今日生活的高壓之下，以馬車代步已非一般平民所能負担了。長春孤立之後，中長路局閒散無事，往日北站車水馬龍，現在門前靜可羅雀。吉林鐵路同忙着搶運營城子產煤，我們還能聽到火車的吼聲。</p>
<p>「民以食爲天」，糧食領頭漲價，鬧得人心惶惶，一月之間，大米由每斤二五〇元漲到三五〇元，高粱米由七〇元，漲到一二〇元、煤由一七，〇〇〇元漲到二四，〇〇〇元，平均上漲三分之一，靑菜肉類漲了一倍。其他日用品成了「日漲品」，紙烟登龍有術，身價一抬十倍。</p>
<p>價的一漲再漲，當歸咎於管理不害，雖有評價委員會之設，但不足以應付如此艱鉅的局面，一週之前，各報曾對某種有背景的蛀米虫大舉撻伐，後來，市政府的發言人出面解釋一番，各報才掩旗息鼓。長春的糧食靠附近各縣接濟，目前正積極向農安，德惠，九台等地搶糧。存糧亦足軍民食用數月，現在不是「糧荒」問題，而是「糧價」問題</p>
<p>長春可以說是經過戰學考騐的，記得五月十八日最緊張的那一天，清晨聽到飛機傳來的濃密砲聲，一般人信爲國軍實彈演習，下午宣佈緊急戒嚴的時候，臨時把中山公園的遊人趕出來，靑年的情侶才感到緊張了。共軍曾衝入市區綠國，混戰一陣。娛樂塲所同樣保持　崢態度，到廿六日動員市民築城，電影才停映。有一家「新中國」戲院的門口，士兵們正忽忙堆積沙包架設鐵絲網，裏面則放映「篤燕流香」，好萊塢的大腿舞非常呌座。現在電影又准演了，影院大登愛情鉅片，自動發電的廣吿，招徠生意。</p>
<p>築城工作一再延期完成，因爲原定計劃爲應付緊急局面，嗣以情勢緩和，乃又加强工事。自五月廿六日起，至六月十六日止，工作二十天，動員累積數達五十萬人，完成環城二十五公里的外壕工事，長春城防大爲鞏固。在封鎖綫未解除前，市郊空房內居留自松北逃來的兩千餘難民，欲退不得，欲進不能，苦哉流民，茫茫無歸宿！共黨「窮人大翻身」政策，翻出了多少老弱孤苦的難胞，點綴着東北的一角錦綉山可！</p>
<p>熊主任式輝在長曾召集黨政軍幹部訓話。這位以不見新聞記者出名的人物，被記者包圍了，他說明了國軍在部署中。孫立人三度來長，他負有坐鎭長春的任務，孫氏對長春城防至爲重視，他說：「長春與瀋陽同樣重要」，他花很多時間偕新一軍高級將領視察城防工事，指示防守機宜。蔣經國及王叔銘來長，是奉主席命來東北　問各級將領的專使。從這些人物的來來去去，顯示長春地位的重要性。</p>
<p>同行是寃家，這句話不錯，我們常聽見新聞界的朋友說：長春的幾家報紙，不是黨的喇叭，就是軍的喇叭，言論旣無可取，編採亦無長處，大有卑不足道的意思。其實，要說長春沒有反對黨的報紙存在是事實，要說沒有民營報紙，則爲無稽。「國民公報」，「工商報」，「正大報」等都是民營的，言論素稱自由，這三家報紙雖都因經濟問題停刋，但也確曾爲民營報紙爭一口氣。在多事之秋的東北，辦報眞是一個難題，現在長春僅存的八家日報，也都在風雨飄搖之中，尤其自長春危困以來，局而更加艱苦了，隨時有夭折的可能。雖說有黨報和軍報，言論都還相當溫和，在東北問題如此洶湧激蕩的時候，各報言論都相當持重，沒有那個報紙肯拉下面皮，公開責備蘇聯炮兵團參加四平之戰。其實軍方所發現的蘇聯武器與鹵獲蘇聯炸藥（附照片）都是蘇聯干涉中國內政的鐵證。我們應該爲長春的報業說一句公范話，在此風雲險惡的時局之下，苦力支撑一張報紙，眞需要艱苦卓絕的精神。現在日報由對開一張縮减爲四開一張，它是在拚命掙扎中。隨着夏季的來臨，晚報竟如雨後春筍，氣象蓬勃，「松花江」，「新生」，「民報」，「新生活」，「今天晚報」等，共有五家晚報。然而這些晚報是先天與後天哺育都不好的孱弱嬰兒，究能經得幾番風雨？希望能隨着時間的進程而茁壯强大起來！</p>
<p>共軍第入旅，前曾一度炸毀海龍梅河口一段鐵路，遭國軍守兵截擊後倉皇遁去，遺棄蘇聯炸藥達十二箱之多。（本報記者趙展寄）（石萬里攝）</p>
<p>槍攤林立</p>
<p>，任人選購，而南寗便是最大的轉遝站，究竟銷向何地，參照上文，即可瞭然。　越南戰事爆發後，給與南寗的影響實不在小。爭自由的「甕提」（安南語，先生之謂），吃了敗仗，便拿起一堆香爐紙（法鈔）跑過鎭南關，到南寗招兵買馬，一個陸軍少尉跑到那邊，保險是一個少將旅長師長之類——儘管一師人數不到一百個兵。馬賽英雄爲了只會跳跳舞，喝喝酒，難耐爭戰之苦，所以也着實看中了這些能征愼戰的三南子弟，大量法卹捧過來，</p>
<p>一批人馬</p>
<p>拉過去作戰，眞是創天下之奇聞，政府雖然一再嚴禁，然而利之所在，拿人家的錢打人家的仗的還是大不乏人。</p>
<p>苦只是苦了越南僑胞，一批一批的流浪入到廣西，邊界，有錢的南寗作萬公，沒錢的連業米也沒得　。憑祥縣新添了一條越僑街，四百多僑胞，沒飯吃的倒有三百多，光靠政府救濟度日，眞是苦得可以。同時越南爲了一塲大打，僑胞歇業之後，差不多已變得民窮財盡，百業着條，昔日自安南太批流入的安南貨，不但已是絕跡桂南，而南寗市塲的米糧布疋雜貨，反而在安南企望之下，大批倒流傾銷，商人獲利，越人獲物，眞是皆大歡喜，現在</p>
<p>桂越道上</p>
<p>，還有大批越盟軍武裝保護自南寗入越銷貨的護商隊組織，也算得上是一件人咬狗的新聞。　爲了這麼一扯，南寗的物價遂創立了廣西的最高記錄，（大概比桂林要高上三分之一有奇），附近各縣的米價，已有高到卅二萬一担的，人民生活的苦處，也就不堪言狀，譬如這裏的公務員待遇，却反低於桂柳不下三分之一。這似乎不很正常吧。這裏的</p>

<p>，向極落伍，一年之前如此，一年之後還是不變，自從國立桂林師院遷此後，似乎稍乘車一點生氣。然而敎育界却似極多事，前些時，省立南寗高中有一批學生爲了操行不及格留級，竟公然把兩個導師打到死去活來，引起教師公憤，全體辭職，至今還未解決。另外兩個中學爲了爭校舍，兩校學生居然全體動員，互相毆擊，竹木石子紛飛，傷人不少，說起來眞是咄咄怪事，納悶已極！</p>
<p>愁雨窘人，百無聊賴，在南寗所可讀頌者，只有三百元一斤的西瓜，一千五百元一斤的荔枝而已。</p>

<h3>最經濟的空氣發動機　（上）</h3>
<p>— 程義坤</p>
<p>上一世紀的初葉，曾經有人想利用空氣的漲力，來作發動機的原動力。一千八百十六年，有一位蘇格蘭的技師施斗林（Sterliug），依據精密的原理，造成了一個熱氣發動機的模型。可惜那時候的工業科學技術尙低，，無法把他的原理造成一經濟合用的發動機。因爲它的効率太低，不能和蒸氣機競爭。後來用汽油和柴油的內燃機，逐漸進步，這熱氣發動機就無法存在，彼工程界所遺忘；連一千九百年以後出板的物理學言籍上，亦極少有再提到它的了。</p>
<p>飛利浦物理試騐室裏，有幾位科學家，經騐到許多地方爲了沒有電力，就無法使用無綫電，電燈和其他一切利用電力的機械，因此就想造一效力高超的發動機，來作發電的原動力，結果想起了這早已被人遺忘的熱氣發動機。因爲它的原理相當好，若能用新的方法加以製造，它的效力一定極高，決不會像以前那樣失敗</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰之前，飛利浦早已開始作進一步的研究：研究如何造成一新的空氣發動機，不辛大戰發生，德軍侵入荷蘭，這種研究和試騐，祇能在極端秘密狀態中進行，因爲這種計劃，如其落到德人手中，他們一定要用來作爲製造武器的原動力。　汽油機和柴油機都是內燃發動機，熱氣機則是一種外燃發動機——這是它們基本不同的地方。汽油機的原動力，是以汽油混和空氣之後，在氣缺之內，用火星塞的火星，使之爆炸，產生熱力和漲力，這漲力即推動氣缸內的活塞。一次爆炸燃燒完畢後，新的汽油和空氣再加進去，再利用火星使之爆炸燃燒，如此連續不斷在氣缸內繼續燃燒，活塞就被不停的推動，它就推動飛輪，產生原動力，柴油機的原理，事實上和它完全一樣。</p>
<p>新式原動機　二週一循環</p>
<p>空氣發動機的原理和上一節所說的完全不同，它的燃燒，不在汽缸內一次一次的進行，而是在缸汽外連續不停的燃燒着。它除用熱力外，并不用爆炸法所生的爆炸力。它每轉動一次，定量的熱空氣（或其他氣體）即輸入至汽缸內，經過——加熱膨脹，冷却，壓緊，等四個不同的步驟而成一週率。但它和普通四週一循環的內燃機不同。因爲內燃機在每兩轉中僅實際產生原動力一次，飛利浦空氣機每轉一次，即實際產生原動力一次。換言之，它是一種二週一循環的原動機。</p>
<p>任何以熟力產生動力的發動機，都希望以最少的熱力產生最大的動力，發動機的效率亦依此而定，目前各種發動機的效率，以柴油機爲最高，汽油機次之，蒸氣機是低，飛利浦空氣機的效率在柴油機和汽油機之間。至于爲何各種發動機，幷不因其效率高底而依然被人們在各處應用着，這是因爲各處的需要和其他種種條件的不同。</p>
<p>飛利浦空氣機是一全新的發動機，幷不是改良老機。</p>
<p>許多人聽到空氣機這名字，一定以爲它是一種老式熱氣機——如上面所說的施斗林式，尹立生（Ericson）式或其他一千八百年式的熱氣機經改良製成渚。這是一種誤會。實際飛利浦空氣機非但在製造方面，即理論方面，都與老式熱氣機有多許多不同的地方。老式熟氣機用相當大的汽缸和活塞，全機重量極大，轉動速度極慢。飛利浦空氣機體積和軍量都極小，轉動速度則極快，每分鐘在三千轉以上。且因其所用傳力，傳熱，以及全機製法，都用完全新的理論和方面製成。它的効率，事實上它和理論上所認爲最高可能効率已相去甚近。</p>
<p>飛利浦空氣機內氣缸中所受最大壓力，約爲大氣壓力的五十倍，它的最高熱度約在攝氏六百五十度左右。因爲它的燃燒工作在汽缸外面進行，汽缸和燃燒工作完全隔離，汽缸內部的熱力和壓力同內燃機汽　內　　　也差不多，決無因熱力或壓力過高，而致炸裂的危險。它的汽缸是用阻熱力極高的特種合金所製成，它可以承受極高的壓力和熱力。它的其他配件，如鍋墟，冷却器，和調節器等都係特製；所以輸熟工作，效力極高。</p>
<p>最重要機構熱力再生器</p>
<p>空氣機上最重要的一件東西是熱力再生器；它是專爲節省全機所需的熟力而設計的。它的位置在汽缸頂上（下簾第一圓）它近汽缸的一面是一塊隔離板（這是用極細的合金絲所製成的，粗看像一堆很鬆的棉花。）板後另外裝着一只汽缸。這汽缸呌做冷汽缸，它亦有一活塞。這活塞並不產生原動力，但和產力動力的活塞連在同一飛輪上。</p>
<p>當鍋爐中產生的熱空氣，輸入至汽缸，即在汽缸中被壓緊而膨漲，推動活塞，再推動飛輸，完成工作而產生動力。這曉汽缸中那已經用過的熱氣，即被熟力再生器吸去，傳至冷氣缸中。冷氣缸的活塞受飛輪的推動，把這已冷下去的空氣，强力壓緊。大約百分之一秒鐘內冷氣活塞轉動一次，即可把這已冷的空氣，由攝氏百度壓至六百五十度左右。這再生的熱氣，依然經過隔離板而輸入至動力汽缸中，用作產力原動力的熱力。</p>
<p>如眞沒有這熱力再生器，則發動機所需的熱力，須全部由鍋爐供給。用了這熱力再生器之後，鍋爐僅須供給四分之一的熱力，已可使全機工作。其它四分之三的熱力，由它利用廢氣再生熱力補足之因用鍋爐的體積和經常所需的燃料，就大大的節省了。</p>
<h3>走馬看南寗</h3>
<p>— 南寗四日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>南陲來去，出入災區，小駐南寗兩日，居處這邊疆重鎭，細細體會一年來的多少變化，總覺得又饒興味，又乏興味！……</p>
<p>南寗古稱宣化，爲桂南第一也是唯一富饒的區域，所以以往做官的流行着這末一句湯頭歌，呌做「金北流，銀宣化，不得貴縣也罷」，便是爲了三地都是有名的肥缺之故，以往如此，現在還是如此，闊別南寗近年，重蒞斯土，不但以往的商店沒有關門，連以前關門的現在都已開張大吉，熙熙攘壤，廣西的都市，除了梧州差可比擬之外，桂柳市塲，眞是望塵莫及！</p>
<p>這一個擁有十三萬人口的小都市，並不見得純粹是一個生意塲合那末簡單，自從注越一戰，平地裏便使它也跟着複雜，再加上一個「將有事於南疇」的政治禍亂，南寗人過的生活够得上緊張。</p>
<p>匪患，似乎還値得注意·據傳盤據於</p>
<p>寗桂邊境</p>
<p>十萬大山小董大塘的「民主聯軍」，對南寗確是「寤寐求之」久矣，雖然現在還在輾轉反側，却已足使人心驚胆跳，五家金店同時接到「籌募軍費，共裏義舉」的通知書。時而一聲戒嚴令下，家家深閉門，眞是多事之秋——在南寗·上思·防城（粵屬）交境一帶據險而居的「刁民」，不納糧，不當兵，反而收糧拉兵，已經是一塲公開的秘密，打家却苦，殘殺無辜，開口便是「我們南路縱隊，我們共軍」之輩，約二千人，嘯集草莽之間，官兵到時，無踪無影，官兵一去，又復橫行到處，日前又有一批向粵屬靈山竄入　寗橫縣境內，更加增加不安，養　貽患，事實上，已非諱疾忌醫可以自安之時。</p>
<p>市面上近日流行着這末一句歌謠，呌做</p>
<p>南寗三禍</p>
<p>：偽鈔，煙土與軍火。三者的來源，大抵是互有淵源，僞鈔之多，是爲了「民主鬥士」財政支絀。因而高唱「翻版自由」，毋容資言之外，單表鴉片這門花樣，眞够得上洋洋大觀，盛極一時，差不多每日自百色（爲桂西一小都市，通滇黔孔道）東下的汽車輪船，確是無日無之，猖獗之勢，已使緝私人員不勝其煩，掀開輪船艙板，有三二百斤，打開汽車馬達，也有一二百斤，旅館裘挖開天花板，也有一兩担，前幾日還有一般輪船爲了載運大批鴉片抵邕至遭封閉，無法無天之狀，已使此間成爲冒險家的最大樂園。據說自桂西運毒東下港粵，如果不會走風，一轉手總有四倍到十倍的利潤，而以各種方式通過憲警耳目過關者，大約每日總在十担八担左右，在南寗成交的，亦復不少。　至於私遠軍火買賣私槍之類，大抵爲腰間有槍的英雄們所傑作，上思一縣，「兵工廠」林立，出產土造手槍以至快慢輕機，手溜彈之類，質地尙佳，一桿手槍約在三四十萬之間，每逢圩期，市塲中</p>

<h3>英游偶談　訪莎士比亞故里</h3>
<p>— 幫叔異</p>
<p>一個中秋節後二日，我們訪問了江南縈色的劍橋大學，把鄕邨遊覽的興趣，越發提高了。繼續作英國大文豪莎翁故里的拜謁，同行的旅伴有鄭師曉滄及子瑞，希震二兄。我們在倫敦，邋請了久客英倫的承緖兄導遊，自然旅途一切順利！提起了莎翁的大名，誰都知道他是英國文學界的巨　，全世界劇壇的祖師，他雖然死了三百多年，但是他劇迭了三十七部不朽的偉大傑作，正像三十七顆光芒四射的明星，永遠照亮了文藝界前進的航程。我一邊正在想今天應該如何景仰先賢？進入莎翁故居第一個印象是什麽……忽然火車停了，知已到了斯脫拉福城的車站。出站門就有英國文化會（British　Council）的招待先生駕了小車來接。我們預定的旅館呌做「威靈與美麗」在斯市的古城（Old　Town）這個旅館用莎翁的名字William和他母親的名字Mary命名，是一種極有意義地引人投宿的方法！這旅館創辦於一六九〇年佈置相當典雅，會食堂的裝飾，完全用刀劍和野獸皮革，主人設計要顯出古色古香的意義。煞費苦心，我們一行五人，費了整天功夫，訪問莎翁的古蹟，可以記載的：</p>
<p>莎士比亞的房于（Shakespear's　House）——包括新地方（New　Place）和莎翁的妻子安哈珊蕙的屋子。此屋在一八四七年歸為國有，到了一八五七年才歸還原主。在此屋中還可以看到許多依利沙白（Elizabethan時代的木，石工程。</p>
<p>在橋角（Hridge　St.）的轉角，有一座規寗屋（Quiney　Heuse）這座房子是Judith　Shakespeart莎翁之女與她的酒商丈夫所居住的房十。但現在已經變成為一個茶館了。在道街另一面有一座哈佛崖（Hovard　House）是一座一五九六年的半木建築物。這座房子的得名，是因為凱絲玲（Katharine　Rogers）早年曾居住這屋中，她後來成為哈佛大學創辦者的母親。此屋於一九〇九由馬立斯先生（Mr.Edward　Morris）送給哈佛大學，作為美國遊客的集會所。</p>
<p>在市府廳（Town　Hall）中，有莎士比亞的像為Wilson听繪。</p>
<p>在敎堂街（Chapel　St.）之底，是新地方（New　Place　Esrate）新地方本來是史脫拉福城最大的房子，是克勞伯頓爵士（Sir　Augh　Clopton）由一四八八年所建成。莎翁在一五四七年把它買下，他也就在此屋中逝世。莎翁死後，此屋幾經糾紛，在一七五七年為加思居而Rev.Francis　Gastrell所拆毀。</p>
<p>在逍座屋子的隔壁有座納喜（Nash's　House）為莎翁之孫女所承繼，現在此屋已改為「新地方博物院」（New　place　Estate　Museum）內包括莎翁拆毀占屋之紀念物，莎翁五十週年之紀念物，以及其他許多當地有趣之物。</p>
<p>在新地方（New　place）的封面，有一吉而德敎堂（GuildChapel）在一四九五年由克勞伯頓爵士重新建造，接聯着這敎堂，有一吉而德堂（Guild　Hall）是一座半木材的建築物、在這房子的上層有一小學（Grammar　School）莎翁兒童時代曾在這裏開始受敎育。我會考究他的史實，他父親呌John　Shakespear。是一個無名的羊毛商和雜糧商。他自己既非書香家世，讀過小學之後，就自己努力奮鬥造成了這採一位空前偉大的詩聖，我一而欽佩他那包羅萬象的天才，同時不由地欣賞這銀色阿鳳河（Avon）　　　的美麗地斯脫拉福鄕邨。</p>
<p>從敎堂（Chapel　St.）到老城（Old　Town）經過Halps　Croft這座老房子據說是屬於莎翁的女婿好而博士(Dr.JohnHan）我們在菩提樹　中阿鳳河的旁邊可以看到有名的三位一體敎堂（Trinity　Church）。</p>
<p>距史脫拉福西面約一哩之遠，與史鎭有幽靜小徑柑通，是肅脫連（Shottery）為莎翁之　安，哈珊蕙(Anne　Hathaway）的小屋，是依麗沙白式（Elizabethan）的半木做的美麗農屋，草蓋的屋頂。室內的一切還保持原來的樣子，很希奇古怪的床和其他許多紀念物，並有一個很引人的古式小花園。</p>
<p>此遊的感想：第一是可愛的「斯脫拉福城」其是名符其實的可愛地（Lovely　Place），可是何以那裏獨多詩意的古蹪，那當然是誕生了大文　莎士比亞的　故，照我們中國地靈人傑的意思來解釋，那末這條淸潔細長的阿鳳河(River　Avon）曲折秀麗，靜靜地流動着，有着處女般的嫵媚，加上垂條的綠柳，拂動在河邊的綠草地帶，河上淸波，照出變幻不定的白雲，像孩子們在藍空遊戲！小麻雀不時地跳躍在林蔭花間，彷彿報道明靜的銀河「阿鳳」早已穿上淸淡的秋裝，迎接詩人們的徘徊，吟唱！</p>
<p>第二，英國人好保守。同時也不忘情於「新奇」所以在斯城的建設計劃，一面盡力保留莎翁古蹪，一面設計一個最新式的劇院，建築在富有歷史性的阿　河邊。就是名聞全球的莎翁紀念（Shakespeare　Memorial）劇院。據說這座劇院，一九二六年毀於火，後由司各得（Elizabeth　Scott）萬新設計建築，為英國最現代化的劇院。專演莎翁遺著名劇，隊了（Titus　Androncus）一種外，都由班生爵士（Sir　Frank　Benson）在這個劇院演出，等到每年的演出時期看戲的人，有從歐洲美國趕來的！可以想見名劇的轟動一時！在莎翁紀念地，還有一個紀念圖　館，　書萬卷，除陳列莎翁遺像外’莎翁時代之名作以及莎翁生時所用夾針及手套等物，也保存在這裏。在莎翁紀念地的附近空地上，並建立莎翁紀念碑(Shakespeare　Monument）此行　師，瑞兄唱和佳作極多，我因為訪持聖有詩友偕行，似不可以無詩，所以讀了瑞兄「樂府馳名三百年，斯城韻事共流傳，徘徊不盡蒼茫意，古道西風又暮烟」一絕，就有一首續貂，記得是「寂寞詩雄年復年，千秋樂府絕薪傳，飛來萬里東方客，吟盡斯城晚樹烟」。算是萬里走訪莎士比亞故里的雪泥鴻爪，工拙當然在所不計。</p>
<h3>老道</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>十月天，那是一個溫暖的下午，五點鐘，下班的鈴聲，玎玲玲的招呼我從辦公室裏奔出，疲倦的腰背，彷彿是剛才釋下了重負，我那麼輕鬆的，無力的，那麽歡喜，又微微地煩惱的，我從中華路走向臨江路，為的是要到宿舍裏趕那一席晚餐。當我拐進了臨江路，那貼在牆上的報紙的副頁，吸引了我，我就停下了脚步，站立在那兒去注視，有一小會兒，身後一個聲音驚動了我：</p>
<p>「小姐。給點錢吧！」</p>
<p>我回頭看，見是一位鬢髮雪白的老道，一雙明亮的眼，彷彿是很胆怯的，視綫裘充滿了央求和誠懇，對於老年人一向是心軟的我，為了這眼光和白髮，我就動手打開我手中的皮包，但是正當我把皮包打開，我聽見他說：</p>
<p>「小姐，多給幾個吧，來生修男子！」</p>
<p>一句話觸怒了我，我想：就是為了自己是一個女子，才在這社會上受多少痛苦，忍多少氣，辦公室裏多少煩惱多少委曲，偏你這個老道，修行人，也道樣的看輕女子。－我就拍的一下把皮包又關上了，也不知那兒來的一陣怒氣，我竟脫口而出的對那可憐的老返說：「為什麽要修男子？我不願意，我就要做女子！」我心裏還想想假如眞有來生的話，閻王爺蚪我做男子我也偏不做，一定的就要做女子。我說了這殃句話就邁開脚步走了，但是我還聽見他咕嚕着說；</p>
<p>「修男子好做官呀！」我也還是實在的忍不住了，我就邊走邊回答他說：</p>
<p>「我不要做官，我不喜歡做官！」</p>
<p>「做了官富貴享福呀！」</p>
<p>隱隱的我還聽見他這麽說，我更氣了，回頭看去，那是那樣的一種目光，多麽令人不忍的，胆怯而失望的目光呀！但這時，一個更熱的情緒佔據着我，彷彿是一陣猛烈澎湃的巨浪，把一個平靜溫柔的微波沖激去了，並沒有能心軟下來，同時心裏却這樣想：你這介修行學道的老道，也都滿口的功名富貴，怪不得那些男人們都想做官，發財了……我這麽想，彷彿同誰生氣似的，撅着嘴，等我走進了飯堂，同桌的早已半碗下肚了；幸虧她們還不是狼吞虎嚥，瞧別桌上的男士們吧，好些菜都早已一掃而光了。</p>
<p>「喂，想心事的人哪，快些兒報告，為什麽出神？為什麽遲到？」</p>
<h3>Recamier肖像</h3>
<p>— 達維</p>
<p>達維（Jacques　Louis　David　1748-1825）生於巴黎，初期作品極幼稚，游學羅馬希臘回法之錄，仍然默默無聞，經法國革命巨頭羅貝司比推薦於革命政府，製作大幅壁畫，始一舉成名，</p>
<p>拿破崙執政時，達維更為得寵，於是專為爭氏歌功頌德，成了當時畫壇之權威。</p>
<p>直到拿氏敗北，達維亦被放逐國外，遁跡白耳義，繼續繪事，廣收生徒，創古典主義。其門徒中最著名者有葛洛（Ｂ.Gros）安格爾（J.A.Ingres）戴拉克窪（E.Delacroix）等。</p>
<p>代表作有「拿破崙加冕」，「Recamier夫人肖像」等。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血340</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「是的……」我知道Ｗ君的意思；他大概想說，昌平以後的這一段，必得我自己去摸索前進；換句話，就是要揑着性命，一步一探，逐步前進。這裏我可以幻想到，除了兩邊軍事佈置之外，還有各方面的諜探，當地的混混，土匪，以及各色各式的危險動作。這可以說，這十來里路，步步都是荊棘，陷阱。要走過這一帶，無異穿過刀山箭林；危險是無法形容的了。但，使命是神聖的；使命大於一切，縱今再危險些，也行向前。</p>
<p>「不過，」Ｗ君有些猶預；「我還不敢斷定耀　小姐，究竟是過去了，還是在昌平一帶，跟敵人苦鬥着，還是大繞灣子，走別一條路上萬全張北去了。這都無從來。這也難怪她，也許隨時都有報告，在中途耽擱着，就像她的天津電訊，竟延遲到三天才到。……除此以外，虎臣的行踪，也呌人捉換不定——總之，沒有消息，是個最大的困難；呌人無從着手————這只好等着忙辛苦一趟了。」</p>
<p>我決定把北平的一切公務，都交託給Ｗ君，代為處理或轉達。為了要情報暢通，當然要呌「〇四」和兩三個副手一路去。那一架法式手提無綫電機，當然是個重要的工具。到了山西之後，也全靠牠來辦理各項通訊工作。但要妥保這件無價工具，不被攘奪或損壞，也是我們此行重大工作之一。</p>
<p>人員方面，「〇四」之外，還有一對夫　，男的呌社二和尙，人家呌他二和尙，我們呌他杜二，滄州人，四十幾歲；據他自己說，十來歲練過把子，因那是遜淸時代，很想從把子上頭考武秀才，中武舉，做武官，好光耀門楣。但民國光復以後，只能改行、在軍隊裏做過小伙子，馬弁，後來做到火頭軍，打雜。</p>
<p>他的太太，也是滄州本籍。要把她的容貌舉止，描摹起來，　單一些說，大概就像水滸一百單八將裏的猛夜叉孫二娘。她慣常用的軍器，乃是一隻降魔杵。她這軍器（一根槓麵杖）不作別用，專門用來對付她口裏的「老茶壺」，火頭軍杜二老爺的。「茶壺」兩字，相當于南方的「忘八」。</p>
<p>這一對賢夫婦在我們長辛店總站裏，也担任的上灶職務；男的採買兼燒煮，女的幹着　房雜務兼任漿洗。別看他們這一對很粗糙，臨時要呌他們打聽些什麽謠言，傳說，消息，等等，倒很能用點詭心計。而且兩人都能動刀放搶；靶子還打很準。可惜兩人都自幼沒念過書，兩人合起來，大概可以寫出五個字，三個字是「杜二和」，是杜老爺的官印；其餘二字是「劉氏」；那是太太的簽名式。為了我們這有許多手續，需要簽字，所以二人花了半條性命，把這四個半字描劃熟了。為什麼只有四個半？因「劉」字筆劃太多，這位猛夜叉杜太太，無論怎樣下苦工，都描劃不來，只能應用减筆的「劉」字；旣是减筆，所以只好算半個字。</p>
<p>慧頑皮的說着，我就把適才的所遇一五一十的說出，惹得她們都笑了。</p>
<p>「那他才眞是個倒　蛋，硬是碰着小姐您的怒氣上啦！」那個小胖子玩笑的說。</p>
<p>但我仍鎖着眉的，無可奈何的分辯着：</p>
<p>「在這個社會上，我們的痛苦，悲哀，煩惱，難道你還不知道嗎？你要是個傻瓜你才能不生氣，你要是個冷心腸的你也才能不關情哩。」</p>
<p>由於我的認眞，晚餐的空氣也變得沉重了。</p>
<p>在第二天的早晨，在辦公室裏，當我想起了昨天的情縈，昨天的我的那種率眞和缺少涵養，我就不由的笑了，但當我想到那可憐的老道，憑空的碰了我這釘子·這藏在我心底的綠因，怎能知道呢？那雪白的鬚髮，龍鍾的老態，胆怯的，期望的目光，我不禁一陣深深的羞愧而懺悔了！我責備着自己，我想我為什麼要那樣的容易生氣呢？我想我為什麽不在把錢給了他之後再發脾氣呢？我想當我忽然把打開的皮包猛又關上，我那臉色一變，生氣的話莫明其妙的吐了出來，在他那時的心上，該不是一陣很難過的打擊嗎？那可憐的心，不會深深的失望着，悲傷着一個施予無端的失去嗎？這樣想着、我眞是後悔而難過了，一種說不出的情緒侵襲着我，在無可無中、我只好默祈着，但願讓我在哪兒再遇見他，那時我要多多的給他一些錢，而且讓我用我的心，我的眼光，我的態度，誠懇的向他致歡。當着黃昏，別人都匆匆的奔向餐廳，我却獨自的徘徊在那條馬路上，等待，尋視，企望着發現那位鬚髮雪白的人影，但是在第二天，第三天，第四天，直到今天，我也一直沒有遇見他。而我的惦念，直到今天，也就不能釋止。</p>
<p>老道！鬚髮雪白的老道！到那兒去了呢？在這生活昂貴，生活艱難的都市，你是怎樣乞討的？到那兒乞討去了呢？——我心裏常這樣默念着：『但願你乞討的手指水遠接受好心人的賜予和溫情，再不要遇見我這樣無禮的使你心靈受歷折的人！」我也常常的在心裏這樣默祈着，彷彿只有這樣才能稍减我心上一點敷仄似的。</p>
<h3>愛爾蘭千年詩選</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>愛爾蘭的詩歌遠比英國史詩「皮奧胡爾夫」（Beowulf）為古舊。何格蘭（K.Hoaglan）小姐所編的「愛爾蘭千年詩選」（1000　Years　of　Irish　Poetry　）是從艾馬金(Amergin）開始的，他的生年比耶穌還要早好幾百年。早期的愛爾蘭，官家詩人的權力僅次於帝王。在愛爾蘭文化上昇期，英國國五阿弗立德甚至離開本國，拜倒在愛爾蘭敎裡們的肢下。這位國王用蘇格蘭高地Gaels人的假名寫詩。</p>
<p>這部愛爾蘭千年詩選是第一部蘇格蘭高地和盎格羅愛爾蘭詩人的選集，對於世界文學貢獻極大。除希臘外，愛爾蘭的詩在歐洲要算是最古舊最純潔的文學了。它的文化影　冰期傳說，尼伯龍琪歌以及澳洲的羅曼斯「古德能尼德」（Gudrunlied）。莎士比亞「羅密歐與朱麗葉一裏的馬伯Mab王后就是從愛爾蘭的Maeve而來；Puck則從愛爾蘭古代的Puca而來。</p>
<p>編者又介紹了兩大諷刺詩，一苜是十四世紀的「理想的樂土」，還有一首是十八世紀的「夜半法庭」。她特別聲明，史維夫特，高爾斯密，王爾德，唐珊南等作家，一般人常認他們為英格蘭人，其實都是愛爾蘭人，應該歸還他們為英格蘭人，其實都是愛爾蘭人，應該歸還他們的市民權。</p>
<p>這詩選裏有愛爾蘭人對於英國暴政的地下抵抗，也有　荒的袁吟，此外幽默的愉快的詩尤多。還有醉酒歌和祈　歌。</p>
<p>這一詩集可稱為詩海。伊卡魯(Icarus)的兩翼翱翔，在風浪中　播。浪漫的戀愛，要求土地的熱情，渴望自由，神秘地與大自然結合為一——這樣都是愛爾蘭人民的聲音，表現在這詩選的最末一首詩裏。</p>
<p>何格蘭女士的序言中詳述愛爾蘭詩歌的歷史，還有一個大事年表。</p>
<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>方回　奎律髓載：夏竦守安州日，宋庠兄弟以布衣遊學，席上各賦落花詩，竦以為有　輔器。趙令　「侯鯖錄」亦云：「二宋落花詩，為時膾炙。實則此落花詩不過晚唐濃豔之格，尙未盡其所長。如宋庠咏西湖之「鑿開魚鳥忘情地，展盡江湖極目天」，始為絕唱』。庠著元憲集三十六卷，詩中雋句，絡繹紛披，如題高明堂後池雜景：『蛙怒愛為先雨呌，燕輕多作逆風飛』；晚春小園觀物：『新筍偶隨枯篠出，野花閒抱故藤開』諸聯，皆極瑰麗秀拔。</p>
<h3>談「選舉」</h3>
<p>— 十郞</p>
<p>去年曾一度舉行所　民意選舉保長，當時曾經造成許多使人啼笑皆非的塲面；假造民意的選舉票，一大把一大把塞進選舉　，兩個集團因為勢均力敵，竟因此造成團毆的塲面，這些，在一個剛剛實施憲政的現象看來，我們的人民與民意機構，還需要好好地學習與鍛鍊。</p>
<p>中國人民一向不習慣民主國家人民應享受的權利。對於民意選舉，向來更漠不關心，因此，雖然政府已　把選舉檢交給人民，但人民大多都沒有好好地運用這個基本權利</p>
<p>你看杜魯門七月六日由浮琴尼亞州坐汽車馳返華府，因為車子開得太快，紐約時報，就寫了：「太快了，總統先生」一文，抨擊這位美國大總統。</p>
<p>在美國，這種人民基本權利的運用，在一個民主國家看來，是極平常的事情。</p>
<p>而我們今年度的保長選舉，又在鬧着什　「違法　票，」，「保民提出控告」等問題，這使英美國家見着了，怎麼不呌人義愧欲死！</p>
<p>我們必須使每一個民衆，了解而且去參與每一個憲政時期人民應參加的活動。在每一區，每一保，使人民習慣於一切民主活動，那麼，對於這些「民意選舉」，當然不致再鬧出什麽「違法塡票」的惡習了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>伊莉莎白和蒙巴頓</h3>
<p>— 雷嬰</p>
<p>英國未來的女皇伊麗莎白公主今年已經滿二十一歲了，在二十一歲生日的那一天，就有人預言，她今年可能訂婚，因為她不幸生在帝皇家，一定要成年之後才有訂婚的資格。</p>
<p>果然，在本月九日，白金漢宮終於傳出了喜訊，英王已經正式同意她和菲列浦·蒙巴頓上尉訂婚。白金漢宮在十日特為舉行了慶賀嘉禮的盛大茶會，一對新人欣然出席，大概結婚大典也不會很遠了。</p>
<p>蒙巴頓本米是希臘的菲列浦親王，是第六名王位繼任人，但是在今年他毅然捨棄了國籍，捨棄了尊號，變成一個英國的海軍上尉。旣然是軍人，當然他自有他的工作，可是伊麗莎白公主却一往情深，每星期總是要寄給他三封信，如果他正好請假在英，那麼他總是溫莎宮裏的常客。伊麗莎白的妹妹，聰明伶俐的十六歲的瑪格麗德公主，常常把菲列浦的事向她的姊姊取笑，可是，據一位皇室裏的賓客說，他總沒有見過伊麗莎白為了這種取笑而生氣。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白是一個極孝順的女兒，她簡直可以說是崇拜她的父親的－正像英王喬治六世一樣，她對任何小節都不有放鬆，喜歡戶外運動，討厭多說多話的人；但是許多人却說她的性格實在還有些像她的「大衛叔叔」，就是那位為了愛情而毅然敝屣尊榮的遜皇愛德華第八，現在的溫莎公爵。他們同樣的喜歡和平民接近，厭惡過分的禮儀拘束，菲列浦居然也來一下放棄入承大統的權利，自然更深鐫在伊麗莎白的芳心裏了。</p>
<p>早在四歲的時候，已經有人和伊麗莎白公主物色未來佳壻，有一家英國的雜誌在那一年還開了一張名單出來，列舉着八個有希望雀屛中選的人物。有一個時期，謠傳她要和丹麥的皇子喬治親王訂婚；又說，比她年長二十五歲的比利時太子查理也很有希望。有一陣，她和漂亮的猶斯頓侯爵過從甚密，但是侯爵不久就被派到印度，悄然到總督府供職去了。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白和蒙巴頓正小相識，他們本來是表兄妹，幼時當常一同在他的母舅蒙巴頓勛爵（現任印度總督）的家裏見面。他一滿週歲就離開了希臘，住在他母舅的府邸裏，後來就在英國學海軍，以最優等自達德茅海軍大學畢業。以後就加入了英國海軍。他在「勇敢」號戰艦上參加了西西利登陸戰，他也目覩了重京灣內日本投降的盛典。但是他長大後祗回到希臘去過一次，住了幾個星期，希臘話他根本就不會說</p>
<p>最初，英王和英后對蒙巴頓是不大滿意的－主要的原因是因為他是希臘人。蒙巴頓一再要求取得英國國籍，然而一連兩次都沒有成功，到第三次才終於如顯一以償了。</p>
<p>可是，伊麗莎白今年已經成年，婚約也終於公布了－上文不是已經說過，她的性格不是和她那位頗為倔強的「大衛叔」有些相像麼？</p>
<h3>儒家之地位</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>元世祖旣滅南宋，混一中國，其典章制度，遂據遼金兩宋之當，並參以四大汗國之餘，於定鼎北京後，下韶制定之，其中特出者，如種族之階級，職業之等第是。前者，元人分種族階級為四，一為蒙古人，次為色目人，再次為南人，最下為漢人。蒙古人為國家之主人，自不待言，色目人乃四大汗國屬，即今之東歐近東諸民族，南人即漢族之久居遼金之地，亡國較早者，漢人即南宋遺民，此四者階級基嚴，互不同化，以迄於元亡。後者，元人又分職業等第為：一官二吏，三僧四道，五醫六工七匠八娼，九儒十丐，置儒於丐之上，娼之下，誠可謂　天下之大稽矣。蓋我國自漢武崇儒以來，儒家思想，即控制社會數千年，今一旦倒行逆施，故違其序，宜乎「儒者」揭竽而起，繫不兩立，然事實並不如此者，（如許衡虞集之仕元是）足知儒家風氣之下，至元已極，後元雖短祚，然其亡國並非由於輕儒，况朱元　，陳友諒，張士誠等，與儒家尤無關係，然則「儒」者云何？直不過以統治階級自命，治則行，不治則藏之滑頭主义者而已。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐茲圖</p>
<p>自來水筆毒氣槍及其他</p>
<p>留心美國的小商店，可以買到無數的小東西，有小得像口紅般的電筒，有比手掌還小的無綫電收音機，有像手錶那麽大小的照相機，有長不盈五寸的磅秤，有九角五分錢一只的八倍望遠鏡，有可以摺疊的浴缸，有可以吸住在牆壁上的曬衣裳　，有比骨牌還小的日曆，有像火柴匣那麽大小的計算器，有灌在紙條上的留聲片，有比火柴匣還小的鬧鐘，有可以摺疊了放在衣箱裏的電船（不是玩具），有六塊錢一只的鑽戒（不是假的），有十塊錢一支的手槍（林肯牌），還有一種自來水筆毒氣槍。便衣偵探都佩有這種自來水筆，一般暴徒祗注意到警察腰間的手槍，却不注意到便衣偵探西裝口袋裏的自來水筆，所放毒氣以催淚性者為多。大概一支筆所放的毒氣量足以使十二個暴徒涕淚泗流，使用自來水筆毒氣槍的人不限於警察，許多在交際塲中活動的女子，手提袋中也可以找到這種東西，碰到不正經的男子，這自來永筆，便可成為她的護身符。出賣自來水筆毒氣槍的舖子很多，他們在偵探雜誌像True　Detective　Stories　等登有廣吿廣每支不過十元左右，自來水筆型的女用手槍也有得賣，價錢比較貴，約在五十元以上，普通考爾脫女用三號手槍，不過三十元左右。此外還有打字機式的桌上鋼琴，按歌譜在打字機上打就成為節奏，有小家庭裏使用的小型升降機，數百元可以裝一只。還有其大無匹，其廉無比的東西，有一千五百元一架飛行堡壘，祗要你有本事搬走任你挑選B-17,B-24,B-29，有可以捲成舖蓋的飛機跑道，可以買來代替四川灌縣的索橋，有水陸空三棲的小飛機，放在汽車行櫥窗裏待價而沽。（十七）</p>
<h3>「布里達之驢」</h3>
<p>— 王玨</p>
<p>當一三〇〇年至一三五八年之間，法國流行着一種譬喩，這響喻是首先出之于哲學家布里達Buridan之口。他說：</p>
<p>設若有二堆草料，放在一匹驢子的面前，草料的容積大小都是一般的。這一匹驢子在這二堆容積大小相同的草料之間，徬徨躊躇，不知道應該選擇那一堆草料先吃起才好？左一個然旋，右一個盤旋，旋得來昏天黑地，結果竟活生生的餓死了。這個諷刺在當時很有名，大家傳說着「布里達之驢」，變成習慣援用的名詞了。</p>
<p>一直到今天，我們還會常在這個世界上遇見此等「布里達之驢」式的人物，縱不至于為着左盤右旋不知所擇而餓死，也當為着左繼右旋不知所擇而　撞死或悽惶死了。</p>
<p>驢是西方　笨拙之物的代表，他們經常駡人為Donkey為Ass，這個Donkey或Ass除　的本義而外，還有義漢和愚人的意思。中國人有時候黎然也不能于驢子之議，然而却會賣弄點小聰明，例如三國志上孫權嘲弄長面孔的諸葛子瑜，拿一塊寫了「諸葛子瑜」名字的牌子，掛在這頭上，在宴客的時候，當着諸葛子瑜的面，開他的玩笑。然而他的小兒子名呌恪的，借了一支筆，在他爸爸名下添上「之　」兩個字，成為「諸葛子瑜之驢」，於是他的爸爸便不是被嘲弄的對象了。這自然博得了舉座的笑聲和贊賞聲。諸葛屬的神童的佳譽，便洋溢四方，並且一直流傳到現在。</p>
<p>可是這只能當作趣事或佳話講講，仍不能為人類解除掉「布里達之驢」的諷刺。</p>
<p>只有詩人有時是會說老實話的，東坡送其姪安筋小詩十四首之中有二句云：「應笑謀生拙，團團如磨　」，他就老實承認自己為了生活竟團團而轉和磨坊中的驢子一般了。這其實決非東坡一人如此，我們誰個眞能免於「布呈避之　」的　　呢？</p>
<p>在一個日本人寫的書上說：一支都是驢兒的國慶，那心情，個不是在支那從南到北旅行過，目覩　壓兒在山隈水邊急走着的情景的人，是領略不到的」。</p>
<p>這好像是有意要侮辱中國人的話，其實不但是中國人，便是日本人，乃至全世界所有國度中的人民，都不免於為驢。</p>
<p>布里達先生竟是個先知，不愧為一個哲學家啊。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>曇花</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>去年七月二十六日晚上八時四十分，本埠黃河路九十二號陳覺吾君培養的曇花兩盆，曾同時開花各一朶，翌日的報紙上都紛紛記載，某報記者，曾用相當美麗的文字，作如下的描寫：</p>
<p>「在强烈電燈光照射下，在厚實而濃綠的葉片間，兩朶曇花都漸漸開放了。粉紫紅色的花蕚的柄，細長如野百合花，直可呼之為『粉頸」。她羞人答答地低下頭，可是，這一瞬間，她已經鼓足勇氣，微抬粉臉，張開暈紅的花瓣來了。花瓣微紅而呈純潔透明狀，極似牡丹，中央有一撮花蕊，顏色顯出粉黃，與荷花的蕊相彷。」</p>
<p>莖葉的形狀則是：「有三四枝硬幹與二十個左右的葉片，葉片形狀宛如仙人掌，在羽狀的葉柄上，有枝狀葉片分裂出葉片來，葉片上，復有新葉片滋生。曇花生長的過程，原來也與葉片相同。更奇怪，花　的柄，是直接從葉片邊緣上鑽出來的。」</p>
<p>最近，七七紀念日的下午七時，西門路山東同鄉會種植的曇花，也開了一朶，據記載，「它的形狀有點類似白色的海棠菊，特別是花托完全與菊花一樣，花瓣的顏色是白的，花蕊是深黃的顏色，花托的顏色比花蕊淡一點。開放後在十點鐘時為最大，大約圓徑在八寸左右；最奇怪的是花蕊特別大，在花蕊的中間，還垂着另一個花形（？），花莖像蓮蓬莖一樣，不渦它是攀在小木架上長成的。花的形狀並沒有什麼奇異，倒是那翠綠色的花紫怪可愛的。」</p>
<p>前述陳覺吾君栽培的曇花，今年也開放了，曾於九日晚在威海衛路新生活俱樂部公開義展，當有多數人已經見到了曇花的眞面目。</p>
<p>去年九月間，蘇州某報記載武進談氏花園栽培的曇花形態，尤為簡明：「兩蓓蕾生於深綠色葉片下端之花梗上，梗作紫醬色，花白如玉，花瓣如帶，計廿餘瓣，略似菊花，花蕊細而柔長，中有一莖，若一枝小花，狀若龍爪菊，挺生其間，如蛭舌之外伸。」</p>
<p>綜合以上幾則記載，我們大略可以斷定，曇花是一種仙人棠科植物。仙人掌科植物葉往往退化，莖肉質而色綠，在植物學上稱為漿莖——是一種變態莖。前文「葉片形狀宛如仙人掌，」「兩蓓蕾生於深綠色葉片下端之花梗上」云云，所謂「葉片」，都是「枝條」之誤。</p>
<p>關於花的形態，記載的文字雖然美麗，但因為沒有應用植物學上一般的術語，如花冠，雌蕊，雄蕊，子房，藥等等習用的名稱來作詳細的·分析的叙述，正像舊籍中對於動植物形態的記載一樣，過於簡單模糊、讀了以後，使人不能獲得明確的印象，那是很可惜的。</p>
<p>編者按：最近曇花開放，編者特請賈祖璋先生撰寫關於曇花之可續有觀。茲先發刊上篇，還有中下二篇，擬於一二日內連續發刊。中臨據作者說係寫「曇花目擊記」；下篇則略作考證。統希讀者注意。</p>
<h3>「日本人」</h3>
<p>— 亞綠蒂</p>
<p>日本人的朝泰暮楚，翻雲　雨的妓女作風是早為世界所熟悉的了，他們是澈頭澈　的機會主義者。上次戰爭中，他們忽而呌松岡獻一架屛風給史太林，忽而又在張鼓峯和蘇聯打起來，忽而派野村，派來栖僕僕於白宮道上，又忽而在珍珠港偸偸摸摸地把美國的艦隊一掃而光，從震駭一時到俯首請降，幾乎只有從櫻花的繁密到凋零的那麽久。</p>
<p>他們極盡取媚拍馬之能事地獻一些歌功頌德的詩文於麥帥之前，把西方民主國的作風捧上天去。所有的日本人都知道這是怎麽一回事，他們是贊同這種舉動的，這樣做往往使他們得了實惠。現在，他們甚至於要求成立軍隊了，飛一個媚眼又撒一會兒嬌，日本人的「做功」眞到了爐火純青的境地。</p>
<p>但是，東京的小伙子們究竟直落些，不愛裝腔，他們是厭棄美國人的。載有美國人的車輛經過時，他們投石子，高聲喊駡，使車上的乘客不得不放下窗幔。還有呢，一個美國人在街上走着，忽然一個日本人迎面衝來，站在他的面前不動，在阻住他的去路的時候，翻白眼給他　，走着的美國人只好讓開，拐一些路再走。</p>
<p>無論是怎樣地穿外套，戴假面具，日本人究竟是變不的</p>

<h3>Simultaneous Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction; Mobilization Outline to be Drafted Soon; Supervisory Yuan Regular Meeting Discusses Coordination</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Executive Yuan held a political review meeting at 10:00 AM on the 11th. Chairman Zhang Qun presided, and the implementation methods of the general mobilization plan were discussed at length. It was resolved that the political commissars of the non-ministerial departments would draft the implementation outline of the general mobilization. It was also decided to base the draft on the overall leadership of the wartime general mobilization, with the key points being: to concentrate the will of the military and civilians nationwide, mobilize national strength, intensify the suppression of the rebellion, and actively promote reconstruction to remove obstacles to constitutional government and achieve the goals of peaceful nation-building, strengthen economic construction, renovate local politics, mobilize manpower and resources, improve grain administration and conscription, maintain social security, alleviate the suffering of the people, protect the legitimate rights of the people, practice thrift in consumption, increase agricultural and industrial production, and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers. The Ministries of National Defense, Food, Finance, Conscription, Economy, and Social Affairs will each draft relevant mobilization plans, to be submitted by the 13th for discussion at a group meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 14th, submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 15th, and passed by the State Council on the 18th before being promulgated for implementation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 107th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th to discuss how supervisory work should be coordinated with the general mobilization plan. Supervisors He Hanwen and Zhang Lu each put forward a proposal, which was discussed in combination. It was decided: (1) to intensify supervisory work in the pacification areas; (2) to intensify the inspection of the work of central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments to see if they are in line with the mobilization plan; (3) for supervisory commissions in various regions to intensify the reporting of corruption; (4) for the Supervisory Yuan to send supervisors to various regions to inspect the actual situation of mobilization; and (5) to strengthen supervisory work over military organs. The proposal is currently being revised and finalized. The meeting, personally chaired by the President of the Yuan, did not end until after 12:00 noon. In addition, the Yuan is also closely monitoring financial controls and speculators manipulating the market.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Refugees from eastern Hebei sent a telegram supporting the general mobilization order, stating that after reading Chairman’s "July 7th" broadcast, they learned of the government's determination to suppress the bandits and seek unity in the suppression of the Communists. The people pledge to follow the general mobilization order and fight to the death with the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] All sectors of society in the Jiangsu provincial capital convened a meeting on the 11th to discuss the campaign to suppress the bandit rebellion and decided to hold a grand meeting on the 20th to support the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion and save the nation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 11th] Shanxi-native Senators Li Peide, Liu Jie, Wu Shipeng, and Zhang Yishan recently sent a telegram to the Chairman supporting the "July 7th" instruction and expressed their willingness to awaken the people of Shanxi to accomplish the entire task of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<h3>At the Resident Committee Meeting of the Senate, Minister Bai Reports on Military Affairs, Emphasizing the Importance of Strengthening Local Armed Forces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Resident Committee of the Senate held its second meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on the 11th. After Chairman Mo Dehui and the Secretariat made their reports, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi was invited to report on the recent military and political situation. According to the report: After the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, the main focus of military and political plans is to strengthen the front-line troops and build up the second-line reserves. At the same time, with regard to the treatment of officers and soldiers, a reasonable adjustment is sought, and the Executive Yuan has in principle decided to increase it. "Well-fed soldiers and horses" will allow for an early completion of the military suppression of the bandits. However, military and political plans must be coordinated with civil administration in order to achieve the desired results. Although the army can achieve control over points and lines in combat, grasping the overall situation depends entirely on the entire population. If the entire population can intensify organization and training, local armed forces can be strengthened, and national financial and material resources can be mobilized at the same time, then the current national general mobilization will not be in vain. Minister Bai elaborated on the importance of organizing and training the people and his personal experience in organizing and training the people in Guangxi, saying: Based on my past experience, I am not only very interested in this, but almost believe that people's armed forces can overcome everything.</p>
<h3>Senate Passes Proposals to Request Disaster Relief for the Guangdong Floods</h3>
<p>After Minister Bai finished his report, the Senators asked some questions and then proceeded to discuss the proposals. The following were passed: (1) The proposal by Senator Juan Ying and others requesting the government to quickly rescue displaced youth and children in the north was passed and sent to the government for consideration and implementation. (2) The proposal by Senator Qian and others requesting the government to designate Nanjing as a national education demonstration area was passed and sent to the government for practical implementation. (3) The proposal by Senator Fang Shaoyun and others requesting the government to quickly send a senior official to Guangdong to supervise disaster relief in order to provide substantial assistance was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. (4) The proposal by Senator Lin Zhong and others requesting the government to allocate large sums of money to relieve the flood disaster in central Taiwan was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. (5) The proposal requesting the government to quickly complete the Yellow River breach closure project to prevent floods and protect people's lives was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. Those present at the meeting today included Chairman Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Wu Yifang, Senators Zheng Kuiyi, Wang Juan Ying, Peng Gechen, Zong Heng, Zhang Qianhua, Yu Bin, Yin Shuxian, Lin Zhong, Fan Yusui, Wu Chunwu, Chen Shaoxian, Lu Qian, Zhou Qianchong, Xue Mingjian, Fang Shaoyun, Pan Chaoying, Cai Zhisheng, Yu Nanqiu, Huang Yanpei, and Secretary-Generals Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen.</p>
<h3>Senators Advocate for Investigating Leaks of Confidential News</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The issue of leaking confidential news from the Resident Committee meetings of the Senate, raised by Senator Peng Gechen at the second meeting of the committee on the 11th, has aroused great attention among all participating senators. They believe that the heads of various government agencies are invited to attend the committee meetings to report on the matters that have been, are being, or will be handled by their respective agencies, and these reports contain detailed information, some of which is confidential and only for reference, not for publication. Now that some news has been leaked, it not only affects the credibility of the Resident Committee and makes government heads hesitant to speak freely when attending future reports, but also the leaker himself is responsible morally and legally. In particular, during the first meeting of the Resident Committee, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie repeatedly requested that his report not be disclosed, but as a result, several foreign newspapers published it, and it differed from Foreign Minister Wang's original report, adding to many diplomatic difficulties. Therefore, all senators advocate investigating the leakage of this news.</p>
<h3>Yishui Recovered in Southern Shandong; Tightening Encirclement of Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th, 11:00 PM] The National Army advancing east from Motiangling entered the city of Yishui at 3:00 AM on the 11th and has completely recovered the city.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th] More than 10,000 Communist troops from the 4th Column have been moving in different directions to raid Zaozhuang and Yixian in recent days. The National Army has cut off their retreat route and is concentrating on annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Linyi, 11th] The annihilation battle launched by the National Army in southern Shandong has achieved local victories. The remaining main force of the Communist troops has been breaking through and fleeing north. After recovering important strongholds such as Heyang, Tangtou, Qingtuo, and Jiehu, the National Army, together with the National Army in Yishui and Mengyin, is pursuing the remaining bandits in all directions. Casualties are estimated to be at least between 60,000 and 80,000.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yanzhou, 11th] The fighting north of Tai'an has extended to the Wandebichunpu area on the 11th, and the Communist troops have suffered heavy casualties. The Jiaoji Railway area of Longshan and the Sangzidian area on the north bank of the Yellow River are calm, but the Communist troop strength around Jimo on the outskirts of Qingdao has suddenly increased, and their movements have intensified.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] Communist troops on the outskirts of Weixian attacked the Daweihe and Xiaoweihe strongholds yesterday and carried a large number of explosive packages to bomb the railway bridges of Daweihe and Xiaoweihe, but were repelled. Fangzi and Weixian are safe. The Communist troops appear to be fleeing back east. The Communist troops gathered in the southeast area of Jinan have reached more than 40,000 people and have three column numbers, so there is an attempt to take Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Dongtai, 11th] The National Army's mobile units are currently launching a mopping-up operation in the area east of Dongtai. Fighting is taking place near Xiaohai. According to relevant sources, the National Army is taking the initiative to search for and annihilate the main force of the Communist troops.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Discovered in Northern Chahar; Still Attempting to Open the Northeast Corridor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Currently, two brigade numbers of Communist troops have been newly discovered in northern Chahar, and it seems they have not forgotten their attempt to open the corridor from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 11th] Communist bandits on the Jilin-Shenyang Railway are retreating steadily. The Communist bandits entrenched near Panshi have completely retreated to the south, and the main force of the Communist bandits in the Chaoyangzhen-Hailong area is also fleeing to the Zhuliu River.</p>
<h3>Women's Groups Gather to Fight for National Assembly Seats; Plan to Request the Government to Consider Increasing the Number</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] National women's groups hosted the press at 4:00 PM on the 11th to make a report. Lü Xiaodao reported on the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the number of women's National Assembly delegates and decided on three points: (1) The government should be asked to reconsider increasing the number of national women's group representatives. (2) The deprivation of the right to vote for national women's groups without branches should be protested to the Legislative Yuan. (3) If the provisions of the election law conflict with the current laws of the government, the government should ask the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. It was decided that each women's group would send one representative to petition the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Government, and the Legislative Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Pingbao Railway Ready for Traffic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The Pingbao Railway will soon be open to traffic. A person from Zhangjiakou said that more than 70 bridges destroyed on the Ping-Sui Railway can be repaired, and traffic can return to normal speed. The more than 70 detours next to the bridges on the Pingbao Line have not been dismantled to prevent the Communist troops from destroying the bridges at any time. Keeping the detours is equivalent to having double tracks. Also, surveying of the Bao-Ning Line has now begun, and construction can be expected.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] Kong Xiangxi flew from Beiping to Qingdao at 5:00 PM on the 11th and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Coastal Defense Fleet; Decision to Establish the First and Second Fleets; Liu Cunjun and Li Guosi Appointed Commanders</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] The Chinese Coastal Defense Fleet will be reorganized into the First and Second Fleets. It has been announced that the current Commander of the Coastal Defense Fleet, Liu Cunjun, will be the Commander of the First Fleet, and Li Guosi will be the Commander of the Second Fleet. Liu is currently training in Nanjing and will return to Qingdao soon. The two will take office at the same time. During Liu's training, fleet deployment will be temporarily directed by the Commander of the Second Base. The fleet on its southern patrol mission is directly commanded by the Ministry of the Navy. The organization of the fleet is an important adjustment to the naval organization system.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] An important figure in naval circles answered reporters' questions, saying: If the Chinese government is not constrained by considerations, it can take decisive measures and declare a certain territorial waters area as a pacification zone, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. In fact, the government has already prohibited domestic ships from sailing to Yantai, Weihai, and other areas, but for foreign ships, based on normal international friendly relations and understanding, such a ban is not necessary. Judging from the current situation, if the ban is issued, our Coastal Defense Fleet will take decisive action, which may cause serious conflicts, but our country cannot be held responsible. The government has announced that the Communist Party is a rebel. The domestic situation has been clarified. As for countries that cooperate with the rebels, they have lost the meaning of normal international friendship. If a ban is issued, it will be very important for clarifying the international situation, but the time for its implementation has not yet arrived.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Wounded and Sick Soldiers Adjusted from June</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The lump-sum compensation for wounded and sick soldiers in combat was originally set at 100,000 yuan for wounded generals, 50,000 yuan for colonels, 30,000 yuan for lieutenants, and 10,000 yuan for soldiers. Sick officers and soldiers were given one-quarter of the wounded rate. It has been implemented for more than half a year since September of last year. Chief of Staff Chen believes that local prices have been rising sharply recently, so he has specially requested the Chairman to increase the compensation from June to 200,000 yuan for wounded generals, 150,000 yuan for colonels, 100,000 yuan for lieutenants, and 50,000 yuan for soldiers. Sick generals will receive 100,000 yuan, colonels 50,000 yuan, lieutenants 30,000 yuan, and soldiers 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the Chairman has approved it and the Ministry of National Defense has notified the commanders of all units and the news agencies at all levels of the ministry to be responsible for handling it together.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen to Fly to Shenyang Today to Boost Morale; to Hold Medal Conferral on Behalf of the Chairman; Attended Military Conference at the Headquarters in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng listened to reports from Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baoding Pacification Office, and senior generals at the Diplomatic Building last night until 10:30 PM. He attended the military conference of the Beiping Headquarters on the morning of the 11th. Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong also attended. He summoned party and group cadres for instruction at the city party headquarters in the afternoon and met with Fu Zuoyi, who came to Beiping in the afternoon, in the evening. Chief of Staff Chen is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 12th to boost morale. Whether he will go to Siping and Changchun will be decided after arriving in Shenyang. During this trip, he will bring many medals, awards, and morale-boosting items that the Chairman awarded to Chen Mingren, Liu Handong, and others. After arriving in the Northeast, he will hold a medal conferral ceremony on behalf of the Chairman. Chen said in a meeting with reporters on the 11th: After the promulgation of the mobilization order to suppress the rebellion, the work of suppressing the rebellion can be carried out effectively. In the past year, we have been fighting a "black war," not daring to conscript soldiers or grain. It can be said that we have suffered losses everywhere, so the work of suppressing the rebellion has often not been able to proceed according to the planned schedule. Regarding the Shandong war situation, he said: The National Army has achieved great success in Shandong. The Communist nest, the mountains of southern Shandong, is already in the deep control of the National Army in the 12th. Donglidian and Nanma have been recovered. In Nanma alone, there are three factories. When reporters asked whether the war situation in central and western Shandong had an impact on the results of the war in the mountains of southern Shandong, Chen said that the National Army will consolidate the recovered Communist nest in southern Shandong. As for the Communist troops fleeing in central and western Shandong, the government will order troops to intercept them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 11th] Important party, government, and military figures in Tianjin, including Uang Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Pacification Office, Lin Weiliao, Commander of the Second Army, Du Jianshi, Mayor, and Li Yaolin, Acting Secretary-General of the Party Headquarters, went to Beiping on the 11th to participate in important meetings.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Says He Has Not Heard About the Establishment of Two Pacification Offices in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] It is rumored here that Chen Chief of Staff's trip to the Northeast is related to the adjustment of the Northeast military organization, and there are rumors that after the establishment of two Pacification Offices in the Northeast (with Sun Liren and Zheng Dongguo as directors respectively), they will be directly under the Northeast Headquarters and the Northeast Security Commander's Office will be abolished.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Du Yuming's leg disease is gradually recovering, and his spirits are improving. He has grown a short mustache and met with reporters on his sickbed. Regarding the establishment of two Pacification Offices in the Northeast, he said he had not heard of it.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong Speaks, Advocating Restoring Wartime Austerity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Huang Shaohong, Deputy President of the Control Yuan, recently expressed his views on the current situation, saying that after the victory of the War of Resistance, we should not have immediately demobilized. To restore national strength, we still need to maintain the hard life of wartime. For example, Britain has shown this spirit, so the implementation of today's general mobilization is not only of military significance, but also of nation-building significance. As for the economic way out for our country, I have two views: one is that economic policy should be for the majority of people, and the interests of the few should be appropriately limited for the sake of the majority. However, in our country today, the private interests of the few hinder the interests of the majority. The second is that there has been too much waste after the war, and wartime austerity should be restored. When asked about his views on the Communist Party issue, Huang said: Because he is not responsible for military affairs, he does not fully understand the actual situation, but from a fundamental point of view, if the lives of the majority of the people are solved, the Communist Party's power will inevitably decline. Huang said that the work of the Control Yuan is of great importance to the difficulty of carrying out the orders and advocated restoring the method of control committee inspections. As for improving the treatment of civil servants, the government should not only consider the capacity of the finances to bear it, but also promote social understanding, as this move will inevitably increase the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Walter Robertson Delayed in Honolulu; Pawley to Come to the Far East Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Walter Robertson, Minister of the US Embassy in China, is currently delayed in Honolulu and is expected to arrive here this weekend. Robertson plans to submit a report to Marshall on the 14th. The State Department has no indication that it will send a new ambassador to China to replace Stuart.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 10th, United Press] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Averell Harriman is passing through here on his way to China. He said that his trip to the Far East is a private one and does not represent the government. He will go to China to observe the situation.</p>
<h3>Refuting False and Evasive Replies, We Protest to Outer Mongolia Again; Mongolian Troops Invading Xinjiang Should Withdraw Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] According to diplomatic circles, the Outer Mongolian government replied to our country's protest regarding the Beitashan incident on June 22, making various false and evasive statements. Then, on June 27, it sent a letter falsely accusing our army of shooting across the border on June 17. It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the facts, telegraphed Ambassador Fu twice on July 8 and 10 (July 10 and 11), lodging a serious protest with Outer Mongolia. The main points of the two notes are: (1) When the Chinese government recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia, it declared that Outer Mongolia should take the then-existing boundary as the boundary. The meaning of this is that the boundary of Outer Mongolia after independence should be the border of Outer Mongolia that was delineated by the Chinese central government before Outer Mongolia's independence. Beitashan is located within Xinjiang Province, and the Xinjiang authorities had police and local garrison outposts there both before and after the recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence. (2) The Outer Mongolian army's deep penetration into Chinese territory for more than 200 kilometers to attack the Chinese garrison at Beitashan should not be regarded as an ordinary border dispute. (3) Even if the events of June 5 originated from the so-called "border dispute," why did the Outer Mongolian government not follow international practice or the current United Nations Charter to seek a peaceful resolution, but instead send an ultimatum to the local Chinese garrison with a 48-hour deadline, and then use armed forces to attack the garrison? This behavior shows that the Outer Mongolian government has no respect for international peace and the conventions jointly observed by the international community. (4) From June 6 to June 30, Outer Mongolian armed forces continued to cross the border to attack Chinese garrisons, and aircraft continued to intrude into Chinese Xinjiang to reconnoiter, bomb, and strafe. (5) In addition to demanding that the perpetrators be punished, guaranteeing that there will be no similar actions, and reserving the right to demand compensation, the Outer Mongolian government should immediately order its troops invading Xinjiang to withdraw.</p>
<h3>We Inform the Soviet Union to Maintain Our Original Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the Beitashan incident, the Soviet government informed our government, denying that Soviet aircraft participated. It is learned that our government has repeatedly investigated the matter in detail and has again sent a note to the Soviet side, maintaining our original protest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] TASS announced today that the Soviet government has never opposed the establishment of Chinese administrative agencies and the stationing of Chinese troops in Lushun and Dalian, and solemnly denied the Chinese Foreign Ministry's claim that the Soviet Union opposed the Chinese government's previous request. TASS also said that the rumor that the Soviet Union has allowed the Chinese Communists to organize troops near Lushun and Dalian is also unfounded.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Talks About Arriving in Beiping: Suppressing the Communists Is Like Catching Rats; the Army Can Attack and Defeat Their Main Force</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Fu Zuoyi took a special plane to meet him in Beiping on the 11th and flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM. He met with Chief of Staff Chen that night. Fu holds an optimistic attitude towards the current military situation. He told our reporter: Currently, people in the community should correct a wrong strategic and tactical concept. People in the community are shaken in their confidence in the government's military strength because the Communist troops are running around everywhere. In fact, at present, the National Army can defeat the main force of the Communist troops and make the Communist troops weaker and weaker, but it cannot fundamentally prevent the Communist troops from running around. For example, even if we have a few people in the house, we may not be able to catch the rat. Since the Republic of China, not to mention the "White Wolf," which ran around for thousands of miles, even small bandits in Suiyuan, such as Yang Houxiao, were suppressed for many years before they were eliminated. Fu also said: The border between Suiyuan and Mongolia and Outer Mongolia is still stable. He does not consider stationing troops on the border. His policy on the border is to seek stability with stability, with less suspicion and avoiding stimulation.</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations Announces Completion of Basic Policy Toward Japan; China Will Receive the Largest Share of Reparations</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] The Far Eastern Commission announced on the 11th that the "Policy Toward Japan After Surrender" has been finalized. This makes it possible to extract reparations from Japan's current and future production. The policy will provide the largest amount to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 10th] The Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations today passed the basic principles regarding policies toward Japan after its surrender. The policy was decided on June 19th of this year and will be implemented after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Based on this policy, the Commission also resolved to send instructions to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo for revision. The preamble to the general policy declares that Japan cannot be allowed to control its own destiny until it is determined to completely abandon militarism, is willing to coexist peacefully with other countries, and has established democratic principles in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.</p>
<p>The "ultimate goals" of the Allied Powers after Japan's surrender are (1) to ensure that Japan no longer becomes a threat to world peace and prosperity, and to establish a democratic and peaceful government capable of fulfilling its international responsibilities, respecting the rights of other countries, and supporting the goals of the United Nations. The establishment of this government must be in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>(2) The above goals can be achieved by limiting Japan's sovereignty to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other outlying islands to be determined; disarming Japan and abolishing military administration; encouraging democratic institutions; implementing industrial restrictions to support its economy; and allowing fair reparations to be extracted. Measures that could lead to Japan's rearmament and engagement in war will not be followed. Japan will eventually be allowed to participate in the World Trade Organization. Under the name of the "Allied Organization," the former consulate will be placed under the Supreme Commander appointed by the United States. The Emperor and the Japanese government should also obey the Supreme Commander, who, if necessary, may dismiss the heads of various provinces of the Japanese government and appoint new people to fill the vacancies. The Supreme Commander will protect the rights and interests of the member states of the United Nations in Japan. The progress of the occupation will be fully publicized to the world. The Committee also instructed to actively disarm Japan and abolish military administration.</p>
<p>No Military Research Allowed</p>
<p>Japan will have no army, navy, air force, secret police organization, civil aviation agency, or military police, but only a suitable civil police force. Senior officers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and staff leaders of extreme nationalist and militarist organizations will be arrested and dealt with further. All war criminals should be subjected to strict trials, including those guilty of cruel treatment of Allied prisoners of war. Freedom of belief will be expressly proclaimed and guaranteed. The desire for individual freedom and democratic progress will be encouraged. All laws or regulations that discriminate against race, nationality, religion, or political beliefs will be abolished. The Committee also instructed that the existing economic foundations of Japan's war machine should be destroyed. Japan is not allowed to produce goods aimed at maintaining military forces or military facilities; Japan cannot engage in any research that is conducive to the development of military forces. Japan will limit its industry to a level that maintains economic living standards and standards, in accordance with the principles of the Committee and the Potsdam Declaration. Its labor, industrial, and agricultural institutions should be based on history and should not be believed to be able to guide Japan's economic efforts. Those who are not conducive to peaceful and democratic purposes will be prohibited by the Supreme Commander from resuming important positions. (2) Plans for the liberation of large industrial and banking conglomerates should be formulated, and other organizations should be substituted on a broader basis of control and ownership. Japan should also supply goods and services to meet the needs of the Allied occupation forces, to the extent that the Supreme Commander deems not to cause famine, widespread disease, and extreme physical suffering. The responsibility of Japanese officials is, first, to avoid severe economic disasters, and second, to ensure the fair and impartial distribution of supplies.</p>
<p>Stipulations for Reparation Materials</p>
<p>(3) Explain the necessary conditions for submitting reparations. (4) Engage in reserves to meet the needs of the Japanese people. Regarding reparations and restitution, the Far Eastern Commission instructed that reparations will be extracted from Japan's existing funds and equipment, and from existing and future production in Japan. These reparations will be used to replenish reparation materials in accordance with the principles set by the Far Eastern Commission and the terms of reference of the Commission. The share of each country in the amount of reparations from Japan will be determined on a broad basis. The destruction of materials and lives and the losses suffered by each country requiring reparations as a result of Japan's preparation and implementation of aggression will be taken into account, as well as each country's contribution to the defeat of Japan and the extent and duration of its resistance to Japanese aggression. All property that has been looted, transferred, seized, or compensated with worthless currency must be fully and actively restored. Japan's domestic financial, monetary, and credit policies must be approved by the Supreme Commander. During the occupation period, Japan will be allowed to purchase raw materials from abroad for peaceful purposes and may export goods to pay for approved imports. All imports, exports, foreign trade, and financial transactions will be kept under control. The Commission will formulate policies governing Japan's imports and exports. All commercial organizations of the United Nations member states will be given equal opportunities for trade and commerce with Japan. Japan will give the same treatment to all United Nations countries. Finally, the Commission instructed that Japan's imperial property should not enjoy immunity in actions necessary for the purpose of the occupation.</p>

Then, Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu was invited to report on the disaster situation in Guangxi. Mr. Huang said: Guangxi suffered heavy losses during the occupation period. After the victory, its vitality has not recovered, and disasters have continued. The counties in northern Guangxi rely on relief every day to survive. Without relief, they would have long become deserts. Last month, eastern and southern Guangxi were hit by heavy rains, causing floods. About 30 counties were flooded, with over two million disaster victims waiting to be fed. The situation is extremely tragic. The Executive Yuan recently approved an appropriation of 2 billion to provide emergency relief, but it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. I earnestly hope that all circles in Shanghai will help generously and express my utmost gratitude on behalf of the people of Guangxi. Huang Shaohong also made a speech, hoping that all circles in Shanghai would provide assistance. Du Yuesheng gave a reply, expressing his determination to do his best to raise funds to live up to expectations.

<h3>American Friends Service Unit Prevents and Treats Kala-Azar in Henan Province; 3,000 Patients Treated in the Past Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Local News] Kala-azar is quite rampant along the Yellow River, and many people have died from the disease. The Friends Service Unit, led by representatives of the American Friends Service Committee in China, has been actively preventing and treating the disease in Henan Province. According to a report by Director Dr. McDonald, remarkable results have been achieved in the past year. Three thousand patients have been treated, and more than 90% have recovered. The disease is most common in children aged 6 to 12 and is transmitted by sandflies. The germs enter the bloodstream when bitten and go directly to the liver and spleen, where they grow and multiply, causing the liver and spleen to enlarge several times their normal size. Patients become emaciated, suffer from anemia and edema, and then develop skin and intestinal ulcers. In severe cases, cancer can also occur. Kala-azar is not difficult to cure if treated early. If left untreated, 96% of patients will die from it. The treatment is quite simple and only requires intravenous injection of a drug called "Neostibosan" once a day for twelve days.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Interim Reparations Should Be Implemented with Priority</h3>
<p>General MacArthur's Headquarters in Tokyo informally announced on the 9th of this month that Japan's first batch of reparations goods would soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, India, Burma, and Malaya, and that each country should submit applications immediately. The reparations goods include machine tools, metallurgical machinery from former arsenals, and synthetic rubber equipment, all of which are not needed by Japan's peacetime industry. According to news from Washington, MacArthur announced that the first batch of Japanese reparations goods would be distributed in accordance with the "Interim Reparations Plan," as MacArthur implemented the policy of the Far Eastern Commission. MacArthur has full power to implement this plan and distribute goods to the five countries including China and the Philippines. The allocation rate for this batch of reparations goods is estimated to be 15% for China, 5% each for the Philippines and the Netherlands Indies, and 5% combined for Burma and Malaya, totaling 30% of the entire reparations. This is a rapid measure taken by MacArthur to implement Japan's Interim Reparations Plan, and it is a precursor to the successful decision of the Far Eastern Commission to prioritize reparations. At a time when the entire reparations issue is difficult to resolve, we should express our approval of MacArthur's measure.</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called "reparations" are the obligations of a defeated country to the victorious countries. They have long existed in international law and are seen in international war practices. Regarding Japan's reparations after its defeat, the Potsdam Declaration had already stipulated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those industries which would enable her to re-arm for war." Based on this spirit, the United States announced its initial policy toward Japan in October 1945, stipulating that Japan's reparations for its acts of aggression should be carried out in the following ways: (A) All Japanese property outside the territory permitted to be retained by Japan shall be transferred for reparations in accordance with the instructions of the Allied authorities; (B) All goods or existing capital equipment not necessary for Japan's peaceful economy or the supply of the occupying forces shall be transferred for reparations. As for items looted by Japan, if they can be identified now, they should be returned in full immediately. According to the initial US policy towards Japan, Japanese reparations included three principles: (1) Japan's overseas assets should be completely transferred for reparations as part of the compensation for the victorious countries; (2) Japan's domestic assets, except for the part of industry retained according to the peaceful economic level, should be used for reparations; (3) All items looted by Japan should be returned. If the Allies cooperate seamlessly, the above principles should be unambiguous. The entire Japanese reparations issue would not have been delayed until today without resolution.</p>
<p>The occurrence of doubts is a regret for the Allied countries themselves. First of all, regarding the retention of Japan's peaceful economic level, the United States' two reports and the Far Eastern Commission's retention of Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934 have virtually protected Japan's existing industry, while reducing the proportion of Japan's resources to be used for reparations. Secondly, the Soviet Union dismantled Japanese factory equipment and materials in the Northeast, which the Soviet Union considered "war trophies." Not only did it refuse to return them, but it also did not agree to include them in the reparations already received by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Far Eastern Commission felt that the entire issue was difficult to resolve; while China and the Philippines were in dire need of reparations to compensate for the huge losses during the war. Thus, since May 1946, the Far Eastern Commission gradually approved the temporary retention quota for Japan's twelve industries, which is the so-called "Interim Reparations Plan." In accordance with the Moscow Resolution of December 1945, it stipulated that the United States did not need to seek the consent of the Far Eastern Commission when implementing "emergency" plans, and authorized MacArthur to handle the entire plan. After accepting the instructions from Washington, the Allied Headquarters began to study the dismantling of Japan's military industry and the types of reparations to be made. MacArthur also proposed a compromise plan for the entire reparations this year. According to US reports, the amount of the entire reparations compromise plan is only equivalent to 60% to 65% of the Pauley Plan. The United States can obtain 30% of the reparations, China can obtain 45%, and the Soviet Union can obtain about 10%. However, the Soviet Union's acquisition of Japanese domestic assets does not exceed 2%. Obviously, the Soviet Union opposes this plan, and it holds the veto power of the Far Eastern Commission and can hinder the entire Japanese reparations plan at any time. Can the victorious countries not regret "abandoning" their rights?</p>
<p>China and the Philippines are the countries that suffered the most from the war and are in dire need of a resolution to the reparations issue, and they have no intention of giving up their own rights. Therefore, in April of this year, the Far Eastern Commission weighed the priorities and decided that the interim reparations plan should allocate the initial 30% to China and the Philippines with priority. MacArthur's handling of this priority reparations was flexible and thoughtful. Before implementing this plan, he allocated 92 Japanese warships to China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union by drawing lots, and the first batch of 32 ships was successfully completed on June 28. Immediately following that, on July 1st, he announced that 30% of the first batch of Japanese reparations goods would be allocated to China and the Philippines. Looking at the situation, if the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have no doubts, it will not be difficult to establish the remaining 70% after this 30% is allocated. Because the differences in the entire reparations issue are now only a matter of principle. The 30% principle is implemented with priority, and the subsequent methods should be very smooth. We agree with MacArthur's measure, and we advocate that China and the Philippines submit applications quickly and distribute reparations as soon as possible, which is based on this principle.</p>
<p>What kind of materials and how much do the 30% priority reparations under the interim reparations plan include? These are issues that deserve attention. According to reports from Tokyo, the 30% priority reparations, calculated by tonnage, is 1.56 million tons. China has half of the priority, totaling 780,000 tons, but it is not yet confirmed. As for the types of materials, they are machine tools and military equipment, which are almost entirely dismantled from Japan's military industry. Originally, these military heavy industries would not be of great benefit to China's construction after they are obtained; but in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism, we also agree that this priority reparations can be successfully completed as soon as possible, and at the same time, we hope to exchange this for the resolution of the entire Japanese reparations issue. Now, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue is quite silent, but there are many strange voices in Japan. Old Congressman Yukio Ozaki has also recently issued arrogant remarks about the reparations issue. Therefore, it is believed that the Allied Headquarters' control of Japan's policies should not be lenient, and the reparations issue should not be lenient in particular.</p>
<p>As for the disposal of this batch of reparations materials, there are many technical issues, such as dismantling, shipping, warehousing, installation, and distribution. The Reparations Committee of our Executive Yuan should carefully stipulate and propose a detailed plan for the types of reparations materials. It is heard that the government plans to sell the reparations materials that can be operated by private enterprises in advance for a price, instead of adopting direct compensation for public and private losses in various places. This principle is feasible. However, when submitting the plan to MacArthur's headquarters, we must pay attention to the types of materials and many technical issues. After obtaining this priority reparations, we hope that our government will put forward concrete opinions on the entire Japanese reparations issue and the return of materials looted by Japan, and must not lag behind in everything and miss the opportunity!</p>
<h3>The United Nations and World Government</h3>
<p>We have just commemorated the second anniversary of the birth of the United Nations Charter. However, according to telegrams from the United States, ten senators have submitted a proposal to the Senate, advocating convening a conference to amend the United Nations Charter and reorganize the United Nations organization, possibly excluding the Soviet Union as a member state. According to the opinion of one of these ten senators, the United Nations organization should be reorganized into a world government, empowered to formulate, interpret, and enforce laws. If the Soviet Union does not cooperate, it should be excluded. We are not surprised by the transmission of this report; however, since the United Nations organization is an international organization, it does not seem possible to change its charter based on the decision of the US Senate, and whether this proposal can become a resolution is still a question. What deserves our attention is that at least some people in the United States have already felt the need to organize a world government. This means that they are preparing to transfer part of the sovereignty of the United States to a strong international organization. We still remember when the San Francisco Conference was convened to draft the United Nations Charter, our Chinese representatives made a call to transfer part of national sovereignty at the conference, but unfortunately, this call is still just an ideal. We certainly hope that the power of the United Nations, this international organization, can be strengthened, but how to strengthen the power of this organization, it seems better to strengthen cooperation with each other under the existing charter, rather than starting with amending the charter. The charter is just a document, and what should be valued is the spirit embodied in this document.</p>

<h3>European Conference Opens Today; Czechoslovakia Changes Its Mind Midway and Refuses to Participate; All Eastern European Countries Under Soviet Control Do Not Attend</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] The European Economic Recovery Conference opened on the 12th in the grand dining hall of the French Foreign Ministry, amidst the division between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 10th] Czechoslovakia, which had originally decided to accept the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan, suddenly changed its mind today, proving that it could not participate to avoid being misunderstood as opposing the Soviet Union and other European countries. The Czechoslovak cabinet received instructions by telephone and telegram from Prime Minister Gottwald from Moscow, which led to this decision. As a result, none of the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe participated in the Paris Conference, and the situation has almost been determined. Czechoslovak Communist Prime Minister Gottwald met with Soviet Prime Minister Stalin in Moscow last night, and immediately telephoned the news to convene an emergency meeting, which lasted six hours. All parties in the National Front then unanimously agreed to withdraw the original proposal. They immediately notified the embassies of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, stating that Czechoslovakia's "situation" made it difficult to accept the invitation from Britain and France. According to the French Foreign Ministry's announcement, it has received replies from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Finland, stating that they declined to participate. The countries that formally replied accepting the invitation included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. With Czechoslovakia's withdrawal, there are only fourteen countries left.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] US diplomats stated today that Czechoslovakia's announcement of its withdrawal from the Paris Conference was "the most blatant expression" of Soviet control over Eastern European governments.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 11th Broadcast: According to Czech political circles, the Soviet Union's note to Czechoslovakia to withdraw from the Paris Conference is tantamount to "slapping the Czech Communist Party in the face." The reason is that Czechoslovakia's initial decision to participate in the conference must first obtain the approval of the ten Communist Party cabinet members. However, Czech Communist leaders said that the acceptance of the invitation had been agreed upon by the Soviet Union in advance. Later, after learning that other countries were dissatisfied with Czechoslovakia's attitude, they might revise their attitude accordingly.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Moscow Radio broadcasted today that Finland had declined the invitation from Britain and France and decided not to participate in the Paris Conference. Moscow Radio said: "It has been announced in the Finnish capital that the country's government unanimously decided yesterday to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Moscow Radio announced tonight that the Albanian government has refused the invitation to attend the Paris Conference to discuss Marshall's aid to Europe plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] Senior US officials warned on the evening of the 9th that the European Recovery Conference, which will open in Paris on the 12th, will be the last chance for Europe to ask the United States for assistance. Countries that do not participate at present will have no hope of obtaining economic assistance in the future.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Minister Arrives in Paris by Plane; Will Deliver Opening Speech to European Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 11th Broadcast: Bevin arrived here by plane tonight and was smiling when he got off the plane.

So far, the Soviet Union has won the first round.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Officials announced that Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the British delegation to Paris tonight to participate in the European Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that efforts will be made to inform the Soviet government about the progress of the Paris Conference. He pointed out that this conference has no political nature, so the door will remain open to the Soviet Union and other European countries, hoping that they will participate at any time. It is expected here that Bevin will emphasize the purely economic nature of this conference in his opening speech to the conference. London also expects that by Monday next week, the proposed cooperation committee and the four subcommittees on food and agriculture, fuel and electricity, steel, and transportation can be established. Bevin will return to London on Monday evening, and Sir Franks will lead the British delegation to participate in the discussion of the specific matters of the conference. Those who accompanied Bevin to Paris included Bathsu, Deputy Under-Secretary of State of the Foreign Office, and economic experts. Bathsu will return to London with Bevin on Monday, and the remaining British representatives who will continue to stay in Paris to participate in the conference include Stevens, Director of the Economics Department of the Foreign Office, Harris, former Economic Counselor of the Embassy in the United States, and experts and advisors from the departments of finance, commerce, food, agriculture, transportation, and fuel.

<h3>European Conference Discusses German Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Allied Reparations Management Council said</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] Rueff, Chairman of the Allied Reparations Management Council, said today that the German reparations issue should be considered in the Paris Conference discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe.

<h3>Truman and Experts Discuss US Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] President Truman held a meeting this morning with Edwin Nourse, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and several members to discuss what the United States can do for the issue of European recovery. Afterwards, President Truman met with the press and declined to comment on the countries that refused to accept the invitations from Britain and France. He only said that congressional leaders are scheduled to hold a meeting at the White House next week to discuss the issue of European exiles. The Marshall Secretary of State's plan for aid to Europe and several issues related to Europe will also be discussed. In addition, it has not yet been decided whether I will go to the Brazilian capital to attend the Pan-American Conference.</p>

<h3>British and American to Begin Negotiations on Ruhr Coal Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that Britain has decided to accept the invitation from the US government to send personnel to Washington to discuss the issue of coal production in the Ruhr region with the US government. The British representatives have not yet been announced and are expected to be senior officials and experts from the British authorities in Germany. According to a statement by Deputy Minister Mayhew in the House of Commons on Monday, the British policy of nationalizing the Ruhr coal mines will not change, and the US authorities believe that the ownership of the coal mines in the Soviet-occupied zone should be exercised by a trustee within five years. At the same time, Harriman, the US businessman who had just inspected the Ruhr region, stated that the United States hopes to understand the reasons that hinder the increase in Ruhr coal production. From this point of view, it can be seen that the United States' invitation to Britain to send personnel to the United States for talks is related to the state of disagreement between Britain and the United States on the ownership and economic issues of the Ruhr coal mines.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Accuses Western Countries of Attempting to Divide Germany</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 10th] Zorin, the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia and head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said at a plenary session of the Commission that Western countries are trying to divide Germany, violating the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, and want to prevent Germany from restoring democracy.

<h3>Soviet Union May Take New Actions to Counter the Marshall Plan; East-West Economic Split Seems Inevitable</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union now appears prepared to engage in a fierce battle against the Marshall Plan for European recovery, using political, economic, and propaganda weapons. The division of Europe has become a reality, and the United States and the Soviet Union will conduct several tests of strength. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall began a series of semi-secret meetings today with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and will use his speech at the Harvard University alumni meeting on May 5 as a basis to strengthen the bipartisan foreign policy to deal with the delicate situation in the coming months.</p>
<p>U.S. officials believe that as the Marshall Plan progresses, the Soviet Union will launch a propaganda offensive against each of its components, and instigate Western European communist parties to attack simultaneously. The communist parties in France and Italy will forcefully use political strikes and other destructive means to prevent its passage during discussions, or to prevent its implementation after passage. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also faces various difficulties: (1) The Soviet Union is now clearly in a position to oppose American aid for European recovery. (2) The extent to which the Soviet Union controls the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia is exposed or may be too early. (3) The Soviet Union has made it impossible for countless people to enjoy assistance in restoring their industry and commerce, and the political forces against this situation will inevitably be strong. (4) The Soviet Union has also placed Western European communist parties in a political dilemma. For the French Communist Party, will it adopt Moscow's opposition line or the French government's support line? The choice is difficult and the result may make its situation more difficult, or even lose its power. Diplomats here also speculate that after Czech Communist Prime Minister Gottwald spoke with Stalin, he used extraordinary means to overturn the foreign policy decided by the Czech cabinet. In that case, will Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk remain in office?</p>
<h3>French Civil Servants Brewing a Major Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] On the eve of the opening of the Paris Conference, France faces the threat of an unprecedented major strike in history.</p>
<p>Representatives of 1.5 million public utility workers nationwide recently stated that civil servants will launch a full and indefinite strike. They continued to secretly study LeMaire's final solution late into the night of the 10th. Until 4 a.m. on the 11th, the strike committee issued a public statement saying, "The committee has been responsible for studying the government's proposals and has asked all its members to await orders and maintain discipline." The committee will meet again at 2 p.m. and will issue its decision after the meeting. If the strike committee decides to strike, all postal, telegraph, telephone, and radio communications to and from France will be cut off. The French cabinet met from 9 p.m. last night to 1 a.m. this morning, and LeMaire convened another cabinet meeting at 9 a.m. this morning to seek a solution. [United Press, Athens, 10th] Despite the increasing tension in the disturbed areas, the Greek Minister of Public Security recently stated that martial law will not be declared in the city of Athens. Regarding the rumors circulating in Thessaloniki that "international columns" have entered Greek territory and that the Communist Party has formed a new government, the Prime Minister stated that he was unaware of them. Although under intense criticism from all levels of the left wing, the Greek government continued its sweep of Communist conspiracies on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Stalin Breaks Precedent and Receives Czech Prime Minister on the Same Night; Soviet Union Attaches Great Importance to the Visit of Czech Leaders</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Marshal Stalin, after Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk arrived here on the 9th, unusually received them on the same night at the Kremlin and held talks with them. Stalin had never received foreign dignitaries on the same day before, so everyone believes that the Soviet Union now attaches great importance to the visit of the Czech leaders. A lengthy meeting was held at that time, but the content of the conversation is unknown. It is reported that the Czech Prime Minister and his party will continue to hold talks with Soviet leaders today, and it is learned that the economic delegation is drafting a supplementary commercial agreement, hoping that the Soviet Union will provide food and other supplies to the Czech Republic.</p>
<h3>United Nations Organs Become Political Battlegrounds; U.S. and Soviet Blocs Confront Each Other; No Agreements Reached on Major Agenda Items in the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] Representatives of several small countries and United Nations officials here are increasingly fearing that the United States and the Soviet Union are using United Nations organs as arenas for power politics, gradually destroying the United Nations system. Although they have not publicly expressed this view, it is not difficult to find this subconsciousness in the United Nations conference rooms and corridors, that is, both the United States and the Soviet Union are committing the mistake of using the United Nations as a political battlefield. Regarding atomic energy control, universal disarmament, and the Balkan issue, the United States and the Soviet Union seem to be merely performing before a world audience in a posture of guns and knives, without any intention of reaching an agreement. The Balkan issue is approaching a "showdown" stage under the insistence of the United States, which has caused great anxiety among the small countries. The United States stated that it would be difficult for the United States to accept the proposal for a semi-permanent border patrol team in the United Nations if it were weakened, and Soviet representative Gromyko seems to be about to use his veto power against this proposal. If so, it will trigger more intense retaliation from the Western powers. The small countries now believe that the spirit of the United Nations Charter has been repeatedly violated by the United States and the Soviet Union in the four discussions of the Balkan issue in the Security Council. If the great powers continue to use the United Nations as a political battlefield, the United Nations will eventually be crippled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] The Security Council held three meetings today, with the following results:</p>
<p>Soviet Union Opposes Austria's Application for Membership</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the "issue of Austria's application for membership," Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his opposition on the grounds that the Austrian peace treaty had not yet been signed. U.S. representative Johnson indirectly accused the Soviet Union of delaying the Austrian peace treaty. Finally, a vote was taken, and the decision to include Austria's application on the agenda passed with a vote of nine to zero. The Soviet Union and Australia abstained.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Protects Numbers for International Police Force</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the "issue of establishing an international police force," Gromyko continued to refuse to submit the Soviet Union's preliminary estimate of the number of troops for the police force. The United States, Britain, and France had already submitted their estimates last week. The Soviet Union believes that the issue of jurisdiction should be decided in principle first.</p>
<p>(3) No agreement was reached on the "issue of the selection of the administrative director of the Port of Trieste," which was handed over to a three-nation group consisting of Poland, Australia, and Colombia for discussion.</p>
<p>Arabs Demand End to Trusteeship of Holy Land</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] Saudi Arabia led the Arab countries on the 10th to make a new demand, requesting the United Nations General Assembly to grant Palestine its independence immediately. Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Faquel, has formally requested that this request be included on the agenda of the September General Assembly, demanding that the United Nations "end the mandate of Palestine and recognize it as an independent state." My Country Requests Two Million Tons of Food</p>
<h3>International Food Conference; Qian Tai Speaks</h3>
<p>My Country Requests Two Million Tons of Food</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The International Food Conference continued its meeting today. Chinese Ambassador to France Qian Tai delivered a speech, stating that the root cause of the current food shortage is that importing countries must increase production to overcome it. The food that China currently requests is already the minimum limit. Although China still lacks as much as 5.4 million tons of rice and grain in the coming year, we are only requesting 10,000 tons. Although China's own food supply situation is not satisfactory, it is still willing to export soybeans and other vegetable oils to foreign countries to meet the needs of other countries. We urgently need a large amount of fertilizer, especially Taiwan, which needs fertilizer the most, because the local farmers are accustomed to using fertilizer. Our production methods have been destroyed by the war. If they can be reused, we will be able to become self-sufficient.</p>
<h3>Group of American Journalists Fly East from Honolulu</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 10th] Ten editors of American newspapers and magazines, invited by the Department of the Army, flew to the Far East for inspection today, departing from here for Tokyo.

<h3>Soviet Union Protests U.S. Economic Aid to Austria at Control Council Meeting; Accuses it of Contradicting Allied Agreements</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 10th] Soviet military commissioner in Austria, General Kolasolov, formally read his statement at the Allied Control Council meeting, condemning the United States for attempting to control Austria's internal economy through the conditions of the U.S.-Austria Economic Assistance Agreement. He stated that these conditions contradict Allied agreements, so the Soviet Union insists that they should be cancelled.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] The Soviet Union today protested to the Allied Control Council the United States' decision to pay for occupation costs in Austria in U.S. dollars. The U.S. plan is to use U.S. dollars to purchase Austrian currency needed for the U.S. military stationed in Austria. The U.S. State Department pointed out that this move can reduce the burden of occupation before the peace treaty takes effect, and the U.S. dollars obtained by Austria will help its economic recovery. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, London is surprised by the Soviet Union's protest and has not yet understood the reasons for its protest. The U.S. plan has been implemented since July 1st, and the Austrian government welcomes it very much. The Austrian Minister of Interior has also called on the other occupying powers, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to take the same steps. Britain's position is that the British government is very willing to take the same steps, but is unable to do so due to its own financial difficulties.</p>

However, King George VI has indicated his readiness to approve the appointments of the two men immediately after the bill is passed. Prime Minister Attlee made his remarks during the second reading debate of the Indian Bill in the House of Commons. He expressed hope that the princely states of India would join the two Dominions of India in the short term.

<h3>"Fake Phoenix, False Dragon" Trial Screening Storm; Barber Locks Down the Grand Theater; Li Lihua and Shi Hui Make Funny Faces; Guests Suffer Innocent Disaster; Perpetrator Taken Away by Officials</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] "Fake Phoenix, False Dragon," starring Shi Hui and Li Lihua, was recently completed by Wenhua Film Company and had a trial screening at the Grand Theater at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The company had been promoting it for a long time beforehand and had issued many invitations, so despite the hot weather yesterday morning, the number of people attending the screening was exceptionally high, no less than a thousand.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as the audience flocked to the theater, the Grand Theater was surrounded by more than 800 members of the city's barber trade union and industry association. All entrances were guarded, and any audience members presenting invitations were blocked from entering. For a time, the audience was baffled, as if they were lost in a fog.</p>
<p>The reason for the barbers' dissatisfaction was that the film's comedic plot depicted Shi Hui, a barber, disguising himself as an overseas Chinese businessman to apply for a marriage advertisement from a widow named Wen Jun. The barbers felt this was satirical and highly inappropriate. They were also very dissatisfied with Shi Hui's use of the Subei dialect to say "Guai Guai" (goody goody) and the scene where he pretended to commit suicide with a razor during the marriage proposal.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Military Service Association Decides: 4 Million Yuan in Settlement Allowance Per Person; Pan Gongzhan Publicly Elected to Continue as Chairman</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Military Service Association held its first meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Speaker Pan Gongzhan presided, and more than ten people attended, including Wu Guozhen, Du Yuesheng, Fang Zhi, Zhang Xiaosong, Xu Jiyin, and Wang Xianqing. The following resolutions were made: (1) Chairman Du Yuesheng resigned due to illness, and Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as Chairman. (2) Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xianqing were elected as executive directors. (3) It was decided to hold a regular meeting every three months. (4) Wang Xianqing and Zhang Xiaosong were assigned to draft the detailed rules for the Military Service Association. (5) The Shanghai conscription law was decided to be drafted by the Standing Committee. (6) The plan to establish a factory for the dependents of conscripts in this city was approved in principle. (7) The interim measures for collecting preferential treatment fees from conscripts were decided to be revised.</p>
<p>Crowds Gathered in Front of the Door; Leaflets Distributed</p>
<p>The association had raised several points for correction a week earlier. It had even requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to ban the film's performance, but to no avail. When they learned yesterday morning that the film was officially being screened, they gathered members of the barber trade from all over the city in front of the Grand Theater, vehemently obstructing the screening. At the same time, they distributed a "Respectful Notice to Ladies and Gentlemen of All Circles in This City," listing eight reasons and four articles for opposition.</p>
<p>At that time, the company was caught off guard. Although they tried to explain to the representatives of the workers, they achieved nothing due to the large number of people and their varied opinions. Because some of the barbers were emotional, a student from Guangdong named Miao Guanqing, who was unaware of the situation, insisted on entering the theater and was beaten by several barbers guarding the door. Upon hearing the news, the Xincheng Police Station dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. When they saw the beating incident, they immediately arrested the perpetrator, Hang Rongkun (34 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at 255 Yuyuan Road).</p>
<p>Wooden Sign Hung Up; Trial Screening Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The situation had escalated to an uncontrollable point, and most of the guests who had been invited to watch the screening, fearing disaster, scattered. At the same time, the police, fearing that the situation would escalate, advised the company to temporarily suspend the screening. After discussions between various parties, a wooden sign was hung up stating, "Negotiations Are Not Complete; Trial Screening Temporarily Suspended." The members of the barber trade union, believing that their goal had been achieved, gradually dispersed, by which time it was already past 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Advertisements on Billboards; Faces Unrecognizable</p>
<p>While the barbers were obstructing the screening at the Grand Theater, some barbers carried ladders and buckets of paint of various colors and successively smeared all the "Fake Phoenix, False Dragon" advertisements on billboards near the Sin Wah Theater and the Huangpo Road intersection with red, blue, and white paint. The faces of Shi Hui and Li Lihua were smeared with red and white paint, making them completely "unrecognizable." A small turtle was also drawn under the names of the lead actors, Li Lihua and Huang Zuolin.</p>
<p>When the situation was tense in front of the Grand Theater, Shi Hui was also present. After witnessing the deterioration of the situation, he took refuge inside the Carlton Hotel and waited quietly with Li Minghui and others for developments. In the end, he returned dejectedly because "negotiations were not complete."</p>
<h3>Xin Liqin Receives a Strange Letter; The Mystery of the Suicide of an American Actress; Stirring Up the Peking Opera Circle in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night, the news that "American Actress" Hua Da (pictured) had committed suicide in Suzhou spread widely in the Peking Opera circle in this city, causing much discussion and regret in the backstage areas of various theaters. The details of this incident are quite tortuous and bizarre, and it can be called the most dramatic of the recent suicide cases.</p>
<p>The first person to hear of this news was Xin Liqin, who is currently performing in the role of a female impersonator at the China Grand Theater. Xin Liqin received a letter yesterday morning signed Jin Miaosheng. The letter stated that Hua Da had lost a diamond ring worth 20 to 30 million yuan in Suzhou and, after searching everywhere without success, had swallowed sleeping pills and jumped into a well to commit suicide. A friend in Suzhou had taken care of the funeral arrangements, which cost 30 to 40 million yuan, and she had already been buried for five days. Xin Liqin immediately showed the letter to her friends, causing alarm among people in the Peking Opera circle. After careful analysis by those who were close to Hua Da, it was suddenly discovered that there was clearly something hidden behind this. An examination of the handwriting in the letter, as well as the sequence of events, revealed many contradictions and inconsistencies, and it was determined that the letter was undoubtedly a forgery. There is no one named Jin Miaosheng in the Peking Opera circle; only Jin Miaosheng, the famous Qingyi actress. From this, it can be inferred that the writer of the letter intended to...</p>
<p>After further research, it was discovered that Hua Da had gone to Suzhou on Monday, while the letter received by Xin Liqin was written on Wednesday, mailed on Thursday, and received yesterday morning. Therefore, the letter's claim that she had already been buried for five days was clearly false.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jin Miaosheng is currently in Beiping and recently remitted 1 million yuan for household expenses, which can serve as proof. Finally, a careful examination of the handwriting revealed that it was no different from Hua Da's own handwriting, which made the matter even more confusing. If the letter was indeed written by Hua Da, then it can be speculated that Hua Da's state of mind when she wrote the letter was either out of dissatisfaction with Jin Miaosheng, resulting in this prank, or for some other purpose. It is said that when Hua Da recently returned to Shanghai after financing a play herself, she said that Jin Miaosheng was "fighting with her" in Qingdao, so she was quite dissatisfied and went to Suzhou in low spirits a few days ago for a short visit.</p>
<p>When the incident first occurred, her mother was extremely anxious. However, after learning that it was a forgery, she was relieved. Therefore, when reporters visited Hua's mother at her residence last night, she finally smiled through her tears and happily saw them off, repeatedly saying, "I'm sorry, thank you for your concern." Hua Da is 22 years old and is of mixed race, hence the name "American Actress." Five years ago, she became a student of Huang Jingbo, a famous amateur actor in this city who was a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, and they agreed to an eight-year "contract." Huang devoted himself to her guidance, and she mastered more than ten famous plays.</p>
<h3>Contracting Project Unfairly Dominated; Father Dies, Son Drowns; Uncle and Nephew Accused of Murder</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xun Henian and Xun Baiji, an uncle and nephew, were accused of murder for financial gain by Liu Liu, a widow, and others at the District Procuratorate yesterday. According to the facts stated in the complaint: Liu Aqing, owner of Liu Qingji (residing at 21 Baoyu Lane, Zhejiang South Road), contracted the rust removal project for the Hefeng Shipyard. In January, due to financial difficulties, Liu invited his friends Xun Henian and Xun Baiji (residing at 22 Gongyi Lane, North Sichuan Road), an uncle and nephew, to participate as the financial backers for the contracting project. Liu Aqing suddenly died of illness in February, and Xun Henian and his nephew took the opportunity to steal and use the important keys and seals of Liu Qingji, changed the name of Liu Qingji to Xun Qingji, and monopolized the business. At the same time, Xun also prevented the Hefeng Shipyard from paying Liu Zhifu, the son of the deceased. Liu Zhifu negotiated with the shipyard's foreman, and Xun arranged for Zhifu to cross the river to the factory on the 27th of last month to collect the money. However, Zhifu went missing after leaving home. Two days later, his body was found floating in the Huangpu River. His mother, Liu Liu, his wife, Qiu, and his sister, Liu Qiaoyun, were deeply saddened and, believing that the Xun uncle and nephew were highly suspicious, jointly filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate.</p>
<h3>Four Model Post Offices Scheduled to Open This Morning</h3>

<h3>Nightclub Patron Arrested; Connected to the Jiang Gongmei Case</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A nightclub patron was arrested at the Sin Wah Cabaret on the evening of the 9th. It is reported that his name is Zeng Yueming, a native of Jiangsu, 40 years old, and he is related to the corruption case of Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, who has already been executed. During the Japanese occupation of this city, Zeng served as a section member in the puppet police station. After the victory, he was recruited by Jiang Gongmei to serve in an important position. After Jiang was arrested, he fled to Hong Kong. Recently, believing that the Jiang case had come to an end, he secretly returned to this city and frequented various dance halls. He was eventually detected and arrested by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Equal Treatment for Eighteen Private Radio Stations Difficult to Approve</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council, based on a previous request from the Eighteen Private Radio Stations of the China Free Radio Association for equal treatment with other radio stations, specially forwarded a letter to the Ministry of Communications for review. According to the Ministry of Communications' reply: "The request that each radio station be allowed to use a frequency is difficult to approve because the number of frequencies is limited. If these stations find it difficult to maintain operations because they have to purchase equipment and cannot reduce staff and national taxes by half by taking turns broadcasting on alternate days, they can negotiate among themselves and, with the approval of the Ministry, two stations can be allowed to use the same equipment to broadcast every day, thereby saving money."</p>
<h3>The Mint in Hibernation; The Place Where the Nation's Wealth Was Once Handled; Now as Decayed as a Declining Aristocratic Family</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Mint, which has experienced ten years of vicissitudes, is like a declining aristocratic family, with deserted gates and dilapidated conditions, making people feel a sense of the changing times. More than ten years ago, when the currency system had not yet been reformed and the silver standard was in effect, it was the place where the nation's wealth was handled. Silver dollars and coins were minted from its dozens of machines and circulated among the people. At that time, it had more than six hundred workers, and the sound of machines was constant and intense. However, after currency reform and the issuance of paper money, it declined. After eight years of war, the site was occupied by the enemy, and the melting workshop became a stable. Machines were dismantled and destroyed. When it was recovered after the victory, it was almost unrecognizable. Nevertheless, it still maintained the facade of an aristocratic family. Looking from the Mint Bridge, you can see its surrounding 80-acre site. Walking through the iron gate, there are lawns on both sides, and the three-story building in the Jianghai Customs style in the middle can still make people appreciate its former grandeur.</p>
<p>Guided by Director Lu of the factory, and with several old employees accompanying us to visit the various departments and explain them one by one, it was truly like "an old palace maid talking about Tianbao," making people feel endless emotion.</p>
<p>We walked into the U-shaped workshop. The first room was a weighing room, with dark walls and dusty rooms. There were two scales that could weigh a ton, quietly placed there. In the corner on the left was a ground scale that could originally weigh several tons, but now only a hole remains. On the other side was a warehouse door that had been removed and was already rusted. These warehouse doors were special products from overseas, used in the same way as bank vault doors. When the War of Resistance against Japan began in 1937, they were removed with the intention of being moved inland, but unfortunately, due to lack of time, they were piled up in the warehouse and destroyed. The current warehouse door is still a steel plate door installed by the Japanese, because they had used the Mint as a vehicle and fire warehouse during the occupation.</p>
<p>Forty Furnaces Remaining Four</p>
<p>Entering the melting workshop from the weighing room, one feels a sense of decline. In the center of the room, two ditches about a foot deep were originally for installing gas pipes, but now they are gone. Originally, there were forty furnaces, but only four remain, and they have been repaired to burn diesel fuel. To the left of the melting workshop is the vault, and the vault door has also been dismantled. Inside are more than 300,000 taels of silver ingots, each weighing more than a thousand taels, which were scattered silver received by the Central Bank after the victory when it took over enemy and puppet property, entrusted to the factory to melt into ingots and verify the composition. Across from the vault, turning around the U-shape, is the rolling mill workshop. Originally, there were more than a dozen rolling machines, but only three remain. The machines in the annealing room have all been dismantled. Turning into the boiler room, you can see the iron door tightly locked, and there are still traces of the Japanese words "Duty Room" on the wall. Only two of the three boilers remain burned out.</p>
<p>Tall Grass Surrounding the Water Tower</p>
<p>Outside the boiler room, in an open space, is a tall water tower, which has been riddled with bullet holes from machine guns. It has now been repaired, and the surrounding grass is knee-deep. The water pipes in the swimming pool-like boiler water changing pool have also been removed long ago. On the other side is a tunnel that looks like an air-raid shelter, leading to the workers' bathroom in the middle of the U-shape. Originally, to prevent workers from stealing, the factory required them to go to the bathroom to bathe after a day's work, and their clothes were thoroughly inspected before they were allowed to leave the factory. This tunnel was the road for leaving the factory after bathing. The tunnel is about thirty feet long and was used as an air-raid shelter by the Japanese during the war. Even now, there is still an iron plate blocking the exit on the other side of the tunnel. Most of the other side of the U-shaped workshop is now being used by the Naval Authorities to store discarded torpedoes and other munitions. A small portion is being used by the factory as a material storage warehouse, with four large scales, twelve small scales, and two stamping machines. The stamping machine is the last machine to produce silver coins. It is about six feet tall and shaped like a "slot machine." It sits quietly in the corner. If it had consciousness, recalling the glory of spitting out silver dollars in the past, it would also be sad about its fate.</p>
<p>Making Copper Sheets to Maintain Operations</p>
<p>Such a large factory, destroyed to such an extent, would require an estimated US$3 million to US$4 million to restore it to its original state. It is truly easier said than done, especially since the era of coins has long passed. So we must ask, what is the Central Mint actually doing now? Starting in 1932, the Mint began minting silver dollars. The initial design was a sailboat with three flying birds and a sun below, but very few silver dollars with this design were minted. It was then ordered to remove the birds and sun from the design. After the currency reform, it continued to manufacture subsidiary coins. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, branch factories were established in Wuchang, Chengdu, Guilin, Kunming, and Lanzhou to melt scrap silver and gold. After the victory, the branch factories in various places were closed. The current work of the head factory is still to melt scrap silver and gold for the Central Bank and to melt copper coins for the Enemy Property Administration. At the same time, it uses its remaining machinery and manpower to engage in the side business of manufacturing copper sheets (for use in hot water heater shells, etc.) to maintain the livelihoods of more than one hundred employees.</p>
<p>Minting Coins All Rumors</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the Central Mint has begun to manufacture coins for the government, but this is completely false. The reason for this may be that the Central Bank, in order to clear small bills, had a large number of banknote boxes that it had no place to store and borrowed a factory building from the Mint to build a shed to store them. The shape of these banknote boxes is exactly the same as the wooden boxes that used to hold 5,000 yuan in silver coins. The Central Bank transported the boxes to the Mint in batches, and the rumors spread like wildfire. In any case, although the Mint has experienced ten years of vicissitudes, the government has always maintained its scale and employees. We can foresee that this declining aristocratic family will eventually be revived, although we do not know when that day will come. [Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of Zhongyong Foreign Firm operating in the black market for gold and banknotes and disrupting the financial market, the District Procuratorate summoned the firm's manager, Ess Gardin, and accountant, Qian Mengchu, for interrogation yesterday. The key points of the investigation yesterday were three: (1) Whether Zhongyong Foreign Firm engaged in banking activities. (2) Whether the firm's receipts and payments were denominated in legal tender after the National Government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on February 17. (3) How much U.S. dollars did the firm pay out and receive after the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan? According to Ess Gardin, the firm has three managers who are jointly responsible, and he cannot bear this responsibility alone. The court found that the accounts needed to be further reviewed and ordered the defendant to remain on bail and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Oil Rationing Based on Population Canceled</h3>
<p>Edible Oil and Coal Briquettes Exclusively Rationed to Factory Workers</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, President Zhang of the Central Bank convened relevant agencies at his private residence to discuss general rationing issues in this city. It was decided to cancel oil rationing based on population and instead exclusively ration it to factory workers at two catties per person per month, at a price of 4,500 yuan per catty. At the same time, coal briquettes will be rationed to workers. The Fuel Control Committee will provide sawdust to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which will then distribute it to the coal briquette factories to manufacture coal briquettes and distribute them to workers at one dan (about 100 pounds) per month. The price has not yet been determined, but it should be cheaper than the market price. The distribution method is the same as for rice rationing. All factory workers who have applied for and been approved for rice rationing are entitled to oil and coal briquette rationing.</p>
<h3>Qiu Lianhuan Murder Case; Fifteen Defendants Recant</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Qiu Lianhuan murder case was first investigated at the District Procuratorate yesterday morning. The suspects arrested one after another, Mao Qingyun, Sheng Shugen, Wei Xiaoyang, Chu Shutang, Chai Liangjiang, Li Desheng, Ye Dongying (nicknamed Hercules), Ma Wenkui (nicknamed August 13), Chen Fugen (nicknamed Little Brother), Fu Qifu (nicknamed Little Afu), Ma Caide, Chen Yonggui, Zhang Ruting (nicknamed Little Aha), Bao Yongfa, and Xiang Yinquan, a total of fifteen people, were brought from the detention center for questioning. In addition, Xue Fuyuan, manager of the Gaoshiman Ballroom, and witnesses Wang Aixiang, wife of Xiang Yinquan, Wu Zhishun, Liu Bingcai, and Zhu Shusheng, teahouse workers at Leyuan Bookstore, a total of five people, were interrogated by Prosecutor Xu Dingkan. The interrogation lasted from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The defendants all denied their previous confessions to the police. However, Xiang Yinquan, Mao Qingyun, Ye Dongying, Sheng Shugen, and Wei Xiaoyang had injuries or bloodstains on their bodies, and the evidence was solid, making them highly suspicious. The court found that the case was complex and required further investigation and ordered that the suspects be returned to custody and the witnesses dismissed.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Calls for Talks with Various Industries to Discuss the Time Limit for Warehouse Receipt Transactions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To formulate measures to restrict warehouse receipt transactions, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned responsible persons from the edible oil, bean cake, rice, grain, and fuel industries yesterday morning and afternoon for talks. (1) Representatives of the oil industry, Hu Yan, and representatives of the oil merchants and bean cake industry, Zhang Chao, agreed that the term for edible oil warehouse receipts should not exceed ten days, as in the past. Due to the peak trading season for the bean cake industry being from April 15 to September 15 each year, it was agreed that the maximum term for storage receipts should not exceed one month. (2) Representatives of the rice and grain industry, Jiang Chengqing, representatives of the rice merchants, Yang Shifang, and representatives of the miscellaneous grain merchants, Xing Zhigang, stated that all rice transactions are currently spot transactions and there are no warehouse receipts, so there is no way to limit the term. (3) Representatives of the fuel industry stated that the authorities currently hope that this city will have a monthly coal reserve of 200,000 tons and are encouraging the import of white coal, so rashly restricting warehouse receipt transactions will affect the import of fuel. The Bureau of Social Affairs stated that it would consider this.</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Children of Soldiers Participating in Combat; Order to Prioritize Approval of Public Funding</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Education has approved the National Defense Ministry's request for preferential treatment for children of soldiers directly participating in combat to attend school free of charge.

In addition to free schooling in public schools at all levels, national schools or public schools in various provinces and cities with public funding slots, or private schools without public funding slots but with free slots, should give priority to the children of soldiers. Since the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents have not been repealed, those who have not been demobilized or discharged and hold certificates of direct participation in combat should still be given priority for approval of public funding or free treatment when their children apply for free schooling.</p>

The decision not to rehire the 30 professors was made by the heads of the various departments and the school through consultation, and it was purely an administrative decision of the school and did not involve any political relations. Zhou strongly denied external rumors that the school was under pressure from outside to dismiss the professors.</p>

<h3>The Crowd Can't Pass Five Barriers (Part 2): Fans Irrationally Gamble on the Outcome</h3>
<p>Some spectators were very dissatisfied with the actions of the Qunsheng team. During the disputes, they constantly shouted abuse and threats. Miscellaneous objects and debris were thrown at the Qunsheng players. After the match ended, they surrounded the Qunsheng players, preventing them from leaving the field. Some even rushed forward. Fortunately, the Boy Scouts present worked hard to maintain order, and the Xinglian players escorted them away from the field, preventing any accidents. However, they were trapped inside the field for as long as one hour. In all fairness, the bad habits of the Qunsheng players in casually protesting on the spot and disregarding the spirit of sports should be condemned, but the crowd's troublemaking and unreasonable shouts cannot be excused either. At the same time, the different refereeing habits between the two places easily lead to misunderstandings and are inevitably one of the causes of disputes. Speaking of the audience's unreasonable shouting, it is truly absurd. Many fans in Singapore, like those in other places, are not only fans of the sport but also of gambling, either on the outcome of the game or on the number of goals scored. Basketball has never been as risky as football, but this time, with Qunsheng touring Singapore, the team is good, and the gambling fans are invisibly active. In the first match against the mixed team, someone bet 5,000 Singapore dollars (equivalent to more than 50 million National Currency) that Qunsheng would win by more than 18 points. As a result, Qunsheng only won by 13 points, and the gamblers lost heavily. This time, with Qunsheng against Xinglian, it was a close match, and the betting was even more intense, with winnings and losses reaching 50 dollars for each goal scored. As a result, watching the game was like watching horse racing, with constant disputes. Most of those who started the shouts and disturbances were this group of people. The basketball match was held at the Happy World Amusement Park Gymnasium, the best basketball venue in Malaya. It is entirely built with cement tile and has a seating capacity of 10,000. Although I wouldn't dare say that all 10,000 people were shouting and making noise, even if only half of them were, it was still lively enough. Domestic commentators said that Qunsheng would panic when losing or drawing. This is very true. The reason why they lost their composure this time was entirely related to losing. In the past few games, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Cai Wenzhang had also protested on the spot several times, but at that time, they always had the upper hand and knew they would win, so their protests were ineffective and they just laughed it off. This time, the situation was different. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, they were still losing by six points, so when their protests were ineffective, they didn't give up and simply refused to play. But why did Qunsheng lose? This is difficult to explain except for "abnormal performance" and "there is always someone better." Indeed, the individual skills of the Qunsheng players are superb, and they have many offensive tactics, but they lack defensive strength. They are used to five-man offense and five-man defense, attacking quickly but defending slowly. This is not a problem when facing weaker opponents, but it was terrible against Xinglian. That night, Xinglian had many excellent passes to the basket, resulting in clear scores, which is a clear example. In this battle, except for Wen Hua and Jin Zhi, who each scored 14 points, the others were out of form. Ball freak Cai Wenzhang, known for "hanging points," only scored three points and was at a loss. However, having said that, if Qunsheng had not lost so "unilaterally" in the second quarter, the outcome of this game might have been difficult to predict. Take a look at the detailed score table below. First quarter: 12-7, Philippines wins. Second quarter: 3-17, Xing wins. Third quarter: 15-12, Philippines wins. Fourth quarter: 11-10, Philippines wins. Total: 41 to 46, Philippines loses. Qunsheng lost, but there are still two games ahead. Many people are worried that Qunsheng may not play again due to this unpleasant incident, but according to reliable news today, Qunsheng has decided to continue as originally scheduled. The Chinese Sports Promotion Association, which is organizing this tournament, will learn from the past and have the association's president, Wu Zaixing, and Singapore's top basketball coach, Chen Shishui, serve as referees. The final two games will be against the Penang team and the Malaysian Chinese Joint Team. Although they are both very strong teams, if Qunsheng does not perform abnormally, it is believed that they will not lose again and again. In any case, the media is urging both sides not to focus on winning or losing, and especially hoping that the Qunsheng team will play a good game to restore their lost reputation.

<h3>Fluctuations Seen in Chinese Stocks: Northern and Shanghai Cotton Brokers Emerge</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially appeared lively yesterday, but soon became fatigued. Trading was limited. Xinhuo still showed vitality, and Jingfu and Xinguang also occasionally revealed their strength. Unfortunately, due to tight credit conditions, Yongsha soon reported a decline again, eventually showing signs of loosening. Over-the-counter interest rates remained high. Yongsha still required 3.6 to 4.05, while small stocks opened at 2.25 to 2.7. There was no intention to actively buy, and more brokers from the North and Shanghai emerged. Purchases by securities giants and those from Guangdong were only slight embellishments. In the end, fluctuations were seen. The morning opened with a high trading price due to the previous day's difference in exchange rates at the National Bank. After opening, Yongsha rose from 1120 yuan, sold by numbers 224, 223, and 94 to 10970 yuan. Numbers 177 and 143, although entering, only struggled slightly around 11000 yuan. Numbers 218, 149, 152, and 85 supplied, retreating to 10800 yuan. Numbers 177 and 14 and 231 were still around 11000 yuan, but numbers 218, 117, 153, 94, and 69 were very eager to sell, forcing Yongsha down to a low price of 10620 yuan. Xinhuo also fell below 4350 yuan due to strong sales from numbers 157, 104, and 165. Numbers 89, 163, 154, and 104 took advantage of the low prices to enter, pulling it up slightly. It was not until 11:30 that there was any movement. Xinhuo rose to around 4550 yuan, bought by numbers 23, 232, 84, 104, and 85. Yongsha also strengthened with purchases from numbers 152, 54, 155, 223, 2344, 231, 215, 24, 102, and 116. At 12:15, credit conditions greatly eased, and it once again exceeded 11000 yuan. Jingfu, under the pursuit of the masses, soared to a high price of 189 yuan. The high over-the-counter interest rates and the hype of scattered purchases only accelerated the stock market's turnaround. Numbers 71, 231, 185, and 45 all closed out, and due to the excess of time, they also competed to sell. Yongsha was the first to fall back, and Xinhuo and Xinguang were also dragged down. In the end, Yongsha closed at 10700 yuan, and the spot Yongsha closed at 10300 yuan. After closing, the closing prices for the current delivery of various stocks showed that Xinguang, Xinhuo, Meiya, Dongdian, and Xinhua rose slightly, Yongsha and Huali remained unchanged, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Jingfu fell slightly, Shangwu and Guohuo fell by half a percent, Lianan rose by half a percent, and Yinglun and Cement were flat. The closing prices for the deferred delivery of various stocks showed that Xinguang and Meiya were flat, Yingfu, Xinhuo, and Hua rose, and Yongsha, Yonggong, and Qinxing fell slightly. Except for Shijie, which was still difficult to recover, the other old stocks outside the market showed a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Board of Directors Holds 19th Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The 19th regular meeting of the Stock Exchange Board of Directors was held yesterday afternoon, with directors Du, Xu Zaming, Shu, Zheng Xiaozhou, Qu Ji, Xu Ji, and Secretary Chen Xingsun attending.

(2) Passed six articles on preventing the circulation of lost stocks. (3) Passed the stock exchange's participation in the Shanghai Municipal Economic Supervision Committee report.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Continue to Decline, Foreign Stocks are Mediocre</h3>
<p>National bonds continued to decline yesterday, and the process was uneventful. Credit conditions were tight. National Bond C opened at 6700, and Baolong and Room 503 sold out. Although Room 533 entered, it still declined to around 6300 at the close. The total transaction volume was around one million. The result was that Grades A, B, D, and E each fell by a small amount of 200 yuan, and National Bond C fell by another 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Although foreign stocks softened, the process was mediocre and consistent. Although the Guangdong brokers bought, the Northern brokers, securities brokers, and banks slightly sold off. Extra-market stimulation反而助賣告, which instead prompted selling. Yisha fell from an opening of 79500 yuan in the morning to a close of 77500 yuan. The result was that, apart from the steel industry, which fell by half a percent, all other stocks declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Negotiate Purchase Issues with the China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Cotton Textile Association Chairman Sun Pingsun and member representative Sun Zhizhi visited Zhang Xu, deputy manager of the purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau, at around 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the purchase of imported cotton without import licenses. They stated that members of the association had already paid for part of the imported cotton and that the losses suffered by cotton merchants according to the China Trust Bureau's purchase methods were too great, requesting a flexible solution. Zhang stated that the methods had been determined and could only be followed, but that the purchase was not mandatory. If each cotton merchant was willing to settle the matter, they should provide all the procedures for ordering the imported cotton individually for direct negotiation. If there were indeed difficulties and the purchase methods were not agreeable, they could choose not to coordinate. Liu and others immediately notified all members of the association via a public letter to check the situation and said that those who needed to contact the China Trust Bureau individually should first explain the situation to the association for introduction.</p>

If Japan's foreign trade is officially opened, the Southeast Asian market will inevitably face fierce competition, directly harming the national economy and indirectly affecting the government's foreign exchange. The plan they drafted was supported by Executive Yuan President Zhang, government leaders Chen Lifu, Zhang Jia'ao, and Shu Yunzhang. It will be submitted for discussion and approval at the National Economic Commission meeting. It is reported that the company received a telegram from the Executive Yuan yesterday, summoning representatives to attend the National Economic Conference to report on the plan for developing foreign cotton textile markets. It is said that the company's Vice Chairman, Mr. Fu Liangjun, flew to Beijing yesterday to attend today's National Economic Commission meeting.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee Discusses the General Situation of Committee Affairs Promotion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chairman Zou Bingwen of the Textile Adjustment Committee met with reporters yesterday and explained in detail the general situation of the committee's affairs promotion, focusing on the most important aspects. The details are recorded as follows: (1) Cotton yarn prices: Since the establishment of the Textile Adjustment Committee, a price negotiation system has been established. The committee discusses and evaluates reasonable prices based on the actual production cost of yarn plus a legitimate profit. At the same time, a flexible pricing system is adopted according to the actual situation. Therefore, the trend of yarn prices in the future is expected to move onto the right track. (2) More than 60,000 bales of cotton supplied to various yarn factories by the Executive Yuan in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months produced about 30,000 pieces of yarn, and it has been decided that the Textile Adjustment Committee will purchase all of them at a price of 6.5 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn, starting immediately. The Textile Adjustment Committee has signed an overdraft contract of 150 billion yuan with the National Bank yesterday to prepare for the purchase of this batch of cotton yarn. (3) The factories under the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association have provided 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn for joint distribution. 8032 pieces of pre-ordered cotton yarn have been delivered to the China Textile Construction Company for distribution. (4) Since the second quarter's import quota for imported cotton, the government will fully implement the policy of commissioning spinning and weaving. It is estimated that in six months, the government can control 70% of the yarn production of national and private yarn factories. For the remaining 30% of yarn production, the government will impose restrictions by adjusting the cloth policy. Therefore, the government has full confidence in the future of yarn and cloth, ensuring stable development. According to Zou, he was originally an executive member of the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization and should have been stationed in Washington, D.C. all year round. This time, he was summoned back to the country to plan the Textile Adjustment Committee. The Agriculture and Food Organization has scheduled its third annual meeting to be held in Geneva starting on August 23rd of this year. The meeting will last for three weeks before and after, and preparatory meetings are scheduled to begin on August 16th. Therefore, he must fly to the United States immediately to handle the official business of the Agriculture and Food Organization. During his absence, the position of Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be temporarily filled by Vice Chairman Tong Jiling. However, Tong is currently also stranded in Geneva. Before Tong returns to China, the chairman will be temporarily filled by Liu Ying, member of the Textile Adjustment Committee and acting Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>After the Expiration of the Business Tax Deadline, Grain Merchants Request Continued Exemption: Decide to Organize a Petition Group to Appeal to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Merchants Associations of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi and the two municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing held a joint meeting at the Youth Association at 12:00 noon yesterday. Discussions continued on the government's exemption of business tax for grain merchants across the country, which is set to expire at the end of October this year. Representatives from various regions believe that grain merchants suffered heavy losses during the war and that grain is a necessity for the general population. As a result of taxation, the burden on the general poor will increase even more. Based on this, they request that the government continue to exempt them from business tax after the expiration of the deadline. It was decided to organize a petition group of grain merchants from the four provinces and two municipalities, and more than ten people, including Wang Tongsheng and Zhang Chao, were selected as representatives to go to Beijing tonight to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the three ministries of economy, finance, and food. A press conference is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 13th to report the purpose of the petition. Finally, a temporary motion by Wang Tongsheng, a representative from Zhejiang Province, was passed to form a joint association of grain merchants across the country. The grain merchants associations of the four provinces and two municipalities are the natural initiators, and preparations will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Unpolished Rice Slightly Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 4,600 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Retail sales at stores were active, and market transactions were acceptable. The market opened higher in the early morning, but turned sluggish at noon. As a result, japonica and indica rice increased by 120,000 yuan compared to yesterday, but sales were very sluggish, forming a fluctuating situation.</p>
<p>Wheat flour rose first and then fell back, with no significant gains or losses. The situation was slightly tight. Foreign flour rose slightly by 1000-2000 yuan. Bran factories did not open, and the owners were firm, rebounding by 2000 yuan. Soybean oil sales were sluggish, and the market was stable. Yingkou cake customers could not sell, and prices fell by 3000-4000 yuan. Soybean oil merchants were still eager to buy, rising by 3000-5000 yuan. Mung beans continued to be processed in Southeast Asia, rising step by step, increasing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans also followed, rising by 3000-5000 yuan. Broad bean sales were average, and prices were weak. Red sorghum was mediocre, and corn lacked vitality. Raw peanuts fell again by 3000-5000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame seeds were scarce and strong, and peas were similar. Wheat was firm, and the market looked tight. Cowpeas were stable. Oil merchants were aggressively buying, and vegetable oil soared by 30,000-40,000 yuan. Soybean oil followed, rising by 10,000 yuan. Clear oil was scarce and increased by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Sesame oil was stable, but raw oil was still being received, falling back by 10,000 yuan, so the situation showed mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>Two Batches of Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>[This report] The foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Myanmar was shipped out of Yangon on the 28th of last month by the Changxing and Huimin lines, with more than 12,000 tons of edible rice. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month. In addition, the foreign rice ordered by the bureau from the United States and South America, Brazil, Ecuador, and other places, totaling about 100,000 tons, is expected to be fully shipped to China before the end of August this year.</p>
<p>A batch of Japanese artificial silk, the amount of which is unknown, which was obtained through barter trade with Japan, may also be shipped to Shanghai within the month.</p>
<h3>Export Cargo Water Insurance Premiums and Freight Charges Can Be Settled First and Then Audited After the Fact</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the start of its work, the Non-Import Cargo Foreign Exchange Application Review Committee of the Central Bank has reviewed more than 300 self-funded student applications and more than 30 cases of merchants' export water insurance travel expenses, etc. After preliminary review by the committee, they will be transferred to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee of the Executive Yuan within days to be submitted to the committee's regular meeting next Thursday for final approval.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is reported that to reduce the difficulties for merchants and meet practical needs, for merchants' export water insurance premiums and export freight charges, each designated bank may settle and sell foreign exchange based on the No. 72 circular issued by the Business Bureau of the National Bank, based on the exporter's documents, and then report to the committee for post-event review. The committee will submit the report to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee of the Executive Yuan for filing. The above measures have been approved by President Zhang of the National Bank and notified to the designated banks to comply with.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Sets Deadline for Returning 1946 Tea Merchant Deposits; Green Tea Expected to Dominate This Year's Tea Production</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank's 1946 tea leaf deposits have been successively maturing this month. However, most tea merchants have yet to return the deposited tea, with a total of 17 billion yuan in deposits still outstanding. The Central Trust of China (CTC) has now been ordered to purchase new tea and provide merchants with legitimate profits. Therefore, the bank is setting a deadline for tea merchants to sell their deposited tea to the CTC to repay their deposits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the bank's负责人 (responsible person): Since the CTC was ordered to announce the purchase of tea leaves, tea merchants have been more enthusiastic about producing tea. To date, 2,000 cases of tea for this year have been shipped to Shanghai. After evaluation by the bank, the quality of this batch of cased tea is considered to be better than in previous years, with no old tea mixed in. This proves that with a sales outlet for tea leaves, tea merchants can also improve the quality of their tea production, thereby expanding exports. In addition, black tea collection is complete, with only some green tea remaining. It is expected that green tea production will exceed black tea this year.</p>
<p>Export Tea Demand Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firms' tea market, there was continued demand for "Chou Chen," "Chen Mei," and other green teas destined for Morocco, Africa. However, after Yongxing and Tongfu foreign firms, as well as Wuchang and other tea companies, sought these varieties, market inventories have gradually dwindled. Furthermore, holders are becoming more insistent on higher prices, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply, hindering transactions and driving prices upward. As for various domestic sales teas, the selling trend remains strong, particularly with "Mao" black tea, where demand from Fengjing, Jiashan, and surrounding areas is increasingly urgent. Prices are exceptionally favorable, and the outlook continues to be bullish.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices from Taiwan Sugar Corporation have fully increased, native sugar varieties including Qing (blue), Chi (red), and Bai (white) followed suit. The public association board shows that the current price of Peruvian raw sugar is 725,000 to 720,000 yuan, the initial price for current 20 medium-grain white sugar was 700,000 yuan, but it immediately fell back to 695,000 yuan and 680,000 yuan. 24 coarse white sugar is 780,000 yuan. Half-car white sugar is 695,000 yuan to 690,000 yuan. Taiwan red sugar is 630,000 yuan. Shantou "Qing" (blue) high-quality goods are 480,000 yuan, and lower quality is 465,000 yuan. Cotton red is 520,000 yuan, and lower quality is 480,000 yuan, totaling over a hundred bags. Hainan red high-quality goods are 480,000 yuan, and lower quality is 470,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan. Ordinary goods are 415,000 yuan, totaling two hundred plus bags. Xinghua white high-quality goods are 623,000 yuan, and Xinghua red is 480,000 yuan to 475,000 yuan, totaling slightly under two hundred. There were only a few dozen bags of "Diao Qing" sugar traded, with high-quality goods at 430,000 yuan to 435,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Draft Industrial Association Law to be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Review</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] According to the National Industrial Association of China, the draft Industrial Association Law has been prepared by the Ministry of Social Affairs and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review in the shortest possible time. The content is divided into nine chapters and a total of fifty-nine articles, the outline of which is as follows: Chapter 1: General Provisions; Chapter 2: Establishment of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 3: Members of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 4: Staff of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 5: Meetings of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 6: Finances and Accounting of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 7: Liquidation of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 8: Supervision of Industrial Trade Associations; Chapter 9: Joint Organizations.</p>
<h3>Revised Handling Procedures for Goods Arrived in Shanghai But Not Permitted to Enter; Deadline for Transshipment Overseas or Abandonment</h3>
<p>[This Paper Report] The Jianghai Customs has recently issued Public Notice No. 139 to establish new handling procedures for import goods not permitted to enter the country. The notice states that since the implementation of the provisional import and export trade regulations on March 1 of last year, the revised provisional import and export trade regulations on November 17 of last year, and the government's restrictions on the import of certain designated goods, there have been instances where goods arriving in Shanghai were not permitted to enter the country due to the inability to present an import license or a violation of government import restrictions. The announcement said that such goods not allowed to be imported may be allowed to be transferred abroad if there is no violation of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, but many declarants do not immediately arrange for transfer, resulting in a large backlog of unresolved cases.</p>
<p>It is now stipulated that all previously accumulated goods not permitted to be imported should be transferred to customs warehouses immediately, or abandoned and handed over to the customs for disposal. Otherwise, they should be transferred abroad within forty days from the date of this announcement. Subsequently, if goods not permitted to be imported are encountered, they should be transferred to customs warehouses, or abandoned, or the consignee or their agent should transfer the goods abroad within forty days from the date of receiving the customs notice that the goods cannot be imported according to regulations. If the goods are declared abandoned, all warehouse storage fees should still be paid by the declarant. If the declarant does not earnestly comply with the above regulations, the customs will not accept any new declarations submitted by the declarant, regardless of the goods being declared, until the accumulated cases have been completely processed.</p>
<p>Ships Traveling to Hong Kong and Macau Must First Declare and Pay Taxes</p>
<p>[Further News] The Customs issued two additional announcements yesterday, stipulating that: (1) From now on, all trade vessels under 200 tons traveling between Hong Kong and Macau and various domestic locations should first declare and pay taxes to the branch customs office under the jurisdiction of Kowloon and Gongbei Customs near those locations before arriving in Hong Kong and Macau or after departing from Hong Kong and Macau. (2) The Customs Lanlu Office will be renamed the Jianghai Customs Lanlu Branch Office from July 10th of this year.</p>
<h3>Rayon Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Rayon prices strengthened again yesterday due to dwindling inventories. The opening price for 120-count Takayama glossy rayon was 30.7 million yuan, but most buyers were in a wait-and-see mode and showed little interest, causing the price to fall quickly. By the midday close, the price had retreated to 30.2 million yuan. The afternoon price for deferred transactions was shouted up by 200,000 yuan, but the final price remained at 30.4 million yuan. 150-count glossy rayon had fewer buyers, and the market price was lower than 120-count glossy rayon, indicating that times and circumstances have changed.</p>
<p>Factory-spun yarns remain steadfast due to demand exceeding supply and sluggish actual sales. The traded price for C-grade yarns opened at 33.5 million yuan. There were small lots of higher grade yarns trading at 2.5 million and 700,000 yuan respectively.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Market Showing Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, prices declined slightly at the opening yesterday morning due to weaker demand. However, as the market closed, some buyers were seen snapping up lower prices, and merchants from the Yangtze River region were also actively purchasing, especially 20-count yarns. As a result, 20-count Special Shuangma yarn rose to 12.5 million yuan, and Shuangma yarn rose to 11.5 million yuan, both increasing by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Brands such as Lanfeng, Tiannv, and Zhong also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming Tiannv Hongfeng also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, 32-count Lanfeng Yinyue fine yarn declined by 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, and 42-count yarn remained stable.</p>
<p>Spinning and Construction Allocation Yarn</p>
<p>[This Paper Report] China Textile Construction Company yesterday followed its usual procedure to handle the joint allocation of yarn by the Spinning and Negotiation Council. Private yarn factories provided cotton yarn for joint distribution, participating in the allocation for the first time yesterday. A total of 1,633 pieces of yarn were allocated, all to the reproduction industry, with a total of 389 application forms.</p>
<p>Regarding the procedures for obtaining purchase permits and paying for exchange of warehouse receipts, for yarn allocated by China Textile Construction Company, the purchase permit is still obtained on the afternoon of the opening of goods, payment is made the next day, and the warehouse receipt is exchanged four days later. For yarn allocated by private factories, the purchase permit is obtained on the afternoon of the opening of goods, the reservation form is obtained from China Textile Construction Company before 4 pm the next afternoon, and payment is made to the delivery factory's office on the third day to exchange for the warehouse receipt, which is invalid after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Show Strength</h3>
<p>Cigarette transactions were particularly brisk yesterday, and the market continued to be strong. The final price for ten-pack Da Ying cigarettes rose to 8.9 million yuan, an increase of 250,000 yuan from the previous day. Lao Dao cigarettes also rose to 7.72 million yuan, an increase of 140,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the trend was better for Yizhong Company paper cigarettes, while Chinese merchant cigarette sticks only rose or fell by 300 to 500 yuan. Sales of 50-stick Qielike canned cigarettes were slightly more active, rising by 1,800 yuan per can, to 59,300 yuan. The 3-5 brand also rose by 1,300 yuan, while other Seaman, Craven, and American cigarette sticks also remained stable.</p>

<h3>A Corner of Changchun: Sounds of Battle on All Sides; Setting Sun over the Solitary City Wall</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Changchun Three Days Ago — By Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>The siege of Changchun for a month is not as tense as imagined from the outside. Currently, Changchun has a strong National Army, capable of not only defending but also launching attacks. The National Army's Advance Corps in the south of Changchun is already relieving the siege of Siping, which serves as strong proof.</p>
<p>However, the recent turbulence in the Northeast is the most intense situation since the National Army took over the Northeast. People in general have suffered a great psychological shock, especially those who came from inside the pass, whose beliefs have been shaken by fear. It is said that many people are fleeing Shenyang. Those with money pack up their belongings at the first sign of trouble and fly south. In Changchun, those who wanted to flee have not had the chance to do so. Seeing this distressing phenomenon, I cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Over the past month, worry has been weighing on people's minds, and life has been shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. On June 13th, the power line from Xiaofengman to Changchun was destroyed, plunging most of the city into darkness. The limited electricity generated by thermal power plants can only illuminate some important government offices. Without electricity, there is no water, and housewives are racking their brains every day. The water supply has stopped, and the toilets of many large buildings are emitting a nauseating odor. The 600,000 residents are forced to use expensive and unsanitary well water.</p>
<p>The city's streetcars have also stopped running due to the power outage. Changchun does not have buses, making "travel" a major problem for this only affordable means of transportation. Several large government offices are located in the suburbs, which are sources of news. Due to the power outage, reporters have had to reduce the number of visits. A round trip by horse-drawn carriage costs 1,000 yuan in circulation notes, or 12,500 yuan in legal tender. Under today's high pressure of life, traveling by horse-drawn carriage is beyond the means of ordinary people. After Changchun was isolated, the China Chang Railway Bureau was idle. The once bustling North Station is now deserted. The Jilin Railway is busy transporting coal from Yingchengzi, and we can still hear the roar of trains.</p>
<p>"Food is the first necessity of the people." Food prices are leading the way in rising, causing widespread panic. In one month, the price of rice has risen from 250 yuan per catty to 350 yuan, sorghum rice from 70 yuan to 120 yuan, and coal from 17,000 yuan to 24,000 yuan, an average increase of one-third. The prices of vegetables and meat have doubled. Other daily necessities have become "daily-rising products," and cigarettes have mastered the art of climbing, increasing in value tenfold.</p>
<p>The repeated rise in prices is due to poor management. Although there is a price evaluation committee, it is not enough to cope with such a difficult situation. A week ago, the newspapers launched a major attack on rice weevils with a certain background. Later, a spokesman for the municipal government came forward to explain, and the newspapers lowered their flags and ceased their attacks. Changchun's food supply relies on assistance from nearby counties. Currently, efforts are being made to seize grain from Nong'an, Dehui, Jiutai, and other places. The existing grain reserves are sufficient for the military and civilians to eat for several months. The problem now is not "grain shortage" but "grain price."</p>
<p>Changchun can be said to have undergone a wartime examination. I remember that the most tense day was May 18th. In the early morning, we heard dense artillery fire from the planes. Most people believed that it was a live ammunition drill by the National Army. When a state of emergency was announced in the afternoon, tourists in Zhongshan Park were rushed out. Only young couples felt the tension. The Communist army once rushed into the urban area and engaged in a fierce battle. Entertainment venues maintained a calm attitude. On the 26th, when citizens were mobilized to build the city walls, movies were stopped. In front of a "New China" theater, soldiers were busy piling up sandbags and erecting barbed wire, while inside, "Du Yan Liu Xiang" was playing, and the Hollywood leg dance was very popular. Now, movies are allowed to be shown again, and cinemas are showing major love films, using self-generated electricity advertisements to attract business.</p>
<p>The construction of the city walls has been repeatedly delayed because the original plan was to cope with an emergency. Later, as the situation eased, the fortifications were strengthened. From May 26th to June 16th, the work lasted for 20 days, mobilizing a cumulative total of 500,000 people, completing the outer trench works of 25 kilometers around the city, greatly consolidating Changchun's defenses. Before the blockade line was lifted, more than 2,000 refugees who had fled from Songbei lived in empty houses in the suburbs. They could not retreat, nor could they advance. How miserable are these displaced people, lost and without a home! The Communist Party's policy of "the poor turning over" has produced many old, weak, orphaned, and impoverished refugees, adorning a corner of the Northeast's beautiful mountains and rivers!</p>
<p>Director Xiong Shihui once convened a meeting of party, government, and military cadres in Changchun to give instructions. This figure, known for not meeting with journalists, was surrounded by reporters. He explained that the National Army was in the process of deployment. Sun Liren came to Changchun three times, tasked with sitting in Changchun. Sun attached great importance to the defense of Changchun, saying, "Changchun is as important as Shenyang." He spent a lot of time inspecting the city's fortifications with senior generals of the New First Army, instructing on defense measures. Jiang Jingguo and Wang Shuming came to Changchun as special envoys of the Chairman to inquire about the situation of generals at all levels in the Northeast. The coming and going of these figures shows the importance of Changchun's position.</p>
<p>Competition is the mother of resentment. We often hear friends in the news industry say that the newspapers in Changchun are either the Party's trumpets or the military's trumpets. The opinions are not worth taking, and the editing and reporting are not strong. They are too insignificant to be mentioned. In fact, it is true that there are no opposition party newspapers in Changchun, but it is unfounded to say that there are no private newspapers. "Guomin Gongbao," "Gongshang Bao," "Zhengda Bao," and others are all private, and their opinions are known to be free. Although these three newspapers have all ceased publication due to economic problems, they have indeed fought for the cause of private newspapers. In the turbulent Northeast, running a newspaper is a real challenge. The only eight daily newspapers remaining in Changchun are also in a precarious state, especially since the siege of Changchun, the situation has become even more difficult, with the possibility of an early demise at any time. Even though there are Party newspapers and military newspapers, their opinions are still relatively moderate. At a time when the Northeast issue is so turbulent, the opinions of all newspapers are relatively cautious. No newspaper is willing to lower its face and openly accuse the Soviet artillery regiment of participating in the Battle of Siping. In fact, the Soviet weapons and captured Soviet explosives (with photos) discovered by the military are ironclad proof of Soviet interference in China's internal affairs. We should say a fair word for the newspaper industry in Changchun. In this dangerous situation, it takes a spirit of perseverance to support a newspaper. Now, the daily newspaper has been reduced from a full sheet to a quarter sheet, and it is struggling desperately. With the advent of summer, evening newspapers are springing up like mushrooms, showing a vigorous trend. There are five evening newspapers in total: "Songhua River," "Xin Sheng," "Min Bao," "Xin Shenghuo," "Jintian Evening News," etc. However, these evening newspapers are weak infants with poor congenital and postnatal care. How many storms can they withstand? I hope that they will grow stronger with the passage of time!</p>
<p>The Communist Army's 8th Brigade once destroyed a section of the Hailong-Meihekou railway. After being intercepted by the National Army's guards, they fled in a panic, abandoning as many as twelve boxes of Soviet explosives. (By our reporter Zhao Zhan) (Photo by Shi Wanli)</p>
<p>Gun stalls are everywhere,</p>
<p>allowing people to choose and buy weapons. Nanning is the largest transit station. As for where these arms are being sold, one can see it from the above.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in Vietnam, the impact on Nanning was substantial. The freedom-seeking "Ong Ti" (Annamese for "teacher") suffered a defeat and brought stacks of altar paper (French banknotes) across the Zhennanguan Pass to Nanning to recruit troops. A lieutenant in the army would instantly be a major general or division commander there — even if the division had fewer than a hundred soldiers. The heroes of Marseille, who only knew how to dance and drink, could not endure the hardships of war. They favored those able-bodied young men from the three regions of southern Guangxi and made large numbers of promises of French francs,</p>
<p>recruiting forces</p>
<p>to fight for them, a truly miraculous event. Although the government has repeatedly forbidden it, the lure of profit is strong, and many are still willing to take the money of others to fight other people's wars.</p>
<p>The only suffering came to the Vietnamese overseas Chinese, who migrated in droves to Guangxi's border regions. Those with money could act like millionaires in Nanning, while those without money had nothing to eat. A Vietnamese overseas Chinese street was built in Pingxiang County, housing more than 400 overseas Chinese, but more than 300 of them had nothing to eat and relied solely on government relief to survive. At the same time, Vietnam, because of the war, had become impoverished after the overseas Chinese businesses had been forced to close down. The Annamese goods that had flowed in from Annam in large quantities in the past had disappeared from southern Guangxi. Instead, the rice, cloth, and sundries from the Nanning market flowed back to Annam in large quantities, making merchants and Vietnamese people happy. Now,</p>
<p>on the Guangxi-Vietnam road,</p>
<p>there are armed escort teams of the Viet Minh army protecting goods coming from Nanning for sale in Vietnam, which is also a strange piece of news.</p>
<p>As a result of these complications, Nanning's prices have set the highest record in Guangxi (probably more than one-third higher than in Guilin). Rice prices in nearby counties have soared to as high as 320,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), making the people's livelihood extremely difficult. For example, the salaries of civil servants here are lower than those in Guilin and Liuzhou by no less than one-third, which seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>culture and education</p>
<p>here are extremely backward. It was like that a year ago, and it is still the same. Since the National Guilin Normal College moved here, things seem to be a bit better. However, the education community seems to be extremely troubled. Some time ago, a group of students at the Provincial Nanning High School, who had failed their conduct grades and were forced to repeat the grade, publicly beat two teachers to death, causing public outrage among the teachers, who all resigned. The situation has not yet been resolved. In addition, students at two other middle schools fought each other over school buildings, with bamboo sticks, stones, and tiles flying everywhere, injuring many people. It is truly an astonishing and puzzling situation!</p>
<p>The constant rain is depressing, and there is nothing to do. The only things to enjoy in Nanning are the watermelons, which cost 300 yuan per catty, and the lychees, which cost 1,500 yuan per catty.</p>

<h3>The Most Economical Air Engine (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yikun</p>
<p>In the early years of the last century, some people considered using the expansive force of air as a prime mover for engines. In 1816, a Scottish engineer named Stirling, based on precise principles, created a model of a hot air engine. Unfortunately, the industrial science and technology of that time were still underdeveloped, making it impossible to build an economically practical engine based on his principles. This was because its efficiency was too low to compete with steam engines. Later, as internal combustion engines using gasoline and diesel oil gradually improved, the hot air engine became obsolete and was forgotten by the engineering community. Even physics textbooks published after 1900 rarely mentioned it again.</p>
<p>In the Philips Physics Laboratory, several scientists realized that in many places, the lack of electricity prevented the use of radio, electric lights, and other electrical machinery. Therefore, they wanted to create a highly efficient engine as a prime mover for generating electricity. As a result, they recalled the long-forgotten hot air engine. Because its principle was quite good, they believed that if it could be manufactured using new methods, its efficiency would be very high, and it would not fail as it had before.</p>
<p>Before World War II, Philips had already begun further research, studying how to create a new air engine. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and German troops invaded the Netherlands. This research and experimentation could only be carried out in extreme secrecy, because if the plan fell into German hands, they would definitely use it as a prime mover for manufacturing weapons. Gasoline and diesel engines are both internal combustion engines, while the hot air engine is an external combustion engine—this is their fundamental difference. The driving force of a gasoline engine is produced by mixing gasoline with air, then igniting it with a spark plug inside the cylinder, creating heat and expansive force. This expansive force then pushes the piston inside the cylinder. After one explosion and combustion is complete, new gasoline and air are added, and the spark is used to ignite it again, continuing the combustion inside the cylinder. The piston is thus pushed continuously, driving the flywheel and generating the driving force. The principle of the diesel engine is essentially the same.</p>
<p>New Prime Mover: Two-Stroke Cycle</p>
<p>The principle of the air engine is completely different from what was described in the previous section. Its combustion does not take place in the cylinder in a series of explosions, but rather burns continuously outside the cylinder. It uses heat, but not the explosive force generated by explosions. Each time it rotates, a fixed amount of hot air (or other gas) is introduced into the cylinder, going through four different steps—heating and expansion, cooling, compression, etc.—to complete one cycle. However, it is different from a typical four-stroke internal combustion engine. Because an internal combustion engine only actually generates driving force once every two rotations, the Philips air engine actually generates driving force once every rotation. In other words, it is a two-stroke prime mover.</p>
<p>Any engine that generates power using heat hopes to generate the greatest power with the least amount of heat. The efficiency of the engine is determined accordingly. Currently, among various engines, the diesel engine has the highest efficiency, followed by the gasoline engine, and the steam engine is the lowest. The efficiency of the Philips air engine falls between the diesel and gasoline engines. As for why various engines are still used everywhere despite their different efficiencies, this is because of different needs and various other conditions in different places.</p>
<p>The Philips air engine is a completely new engine, not an improvement of an old one.</p>
<p>Many people who hear the name "air engine" will definitely think that it is an old-fashioned hot air engine—such as the Stirling engine, the Ericson engine, or other 1800s-style hot air engines that have been improved and manufactured. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, the Philips air engine differs from old-fashioned hot air engines not only in manufacturing but also in theory. Old-fashioned hot air engines use relatively large cylinders and pistons, and the entire machine is very heavy, with a very slow rotational speed. The Philips air engine is very small in size and weight, and its rotational speed is very fast, above three thousand revolutions per minute. Moreover, its force transmission, heat transfer, and the entire machine's manufacturing process are all made using completely new theories and methods. Its efficiency is, in fact, very close to the highest possible efficiency considered in theory.</p>
<p>The maximum pressure inside the cylinders of the Philips air engine is about fifty times the atmospheric pressure, and its maximum temperature is about 650 degrees Celsius. Because its combustion work takes place outside the cylinder, the cylinder and the combustion work are completely isolated. The heat and pressure inside the cylinder are roughly the same as in an internal combustion engine, so there is no danger of explosion due to excessive heat or pressure. Its cylinder is made of a special alloy with extremely high heat resistance, which can withstand extremely high pressure and heat. Its other components, such as the boiler, cooler, and regulator, are all specially made, so the heat transfer work is extremely efficient.</p>
<p>Most Important Mechanism: Heat Regenerator</p>
<p>The most important component on the air engine is the heat regenerator, which is specifically designed to save the heat required by the entire machine. It is located on top of the cylinder (see the first circle in the lower picture). The side closest to the cylinder is an isolation plate (made of extremely fine alloy wire, looking like a pile of very loose cotton). Behind the plate is another cylinder, called the cold cylinder, which also has a piston. This piston does not generate driving force, but is connected to the flywheel on the same shaft as the piston that generates the driving force.</p>
<p>When the hot air generated in the boiler is introduced into the cylinder, it is compressed and expanded in the cylinder, pushing the piston and then the flywheel, completing the work and generating power. The hot air that has already been used in the cylinder is then absorbed by the heat regenerator and transferred to the cold cylinder. The cold cylinder's piston, driven by the flywheel, forcefully compresses the cooled air. In about one-hundredth of a second, the cold air piston rotates once, raising the temperature of the cooled air from about 100 degrees Celsius to about 650 degrees Celsius. This regenerated hot air is then passed back through the isolation plate and introduced into the power cylinder, where it is used as the heat for generating the driving force.</p>
<p>If there were no heat regenerator, the engine would need to have all heat supplied by the boiler. By using this heat regenerator, the boiler only needs to supply one-quarter of the heat to keep the entire machine working. The other three-quarters of the heat is supplemented by it using waste gas to regenerate heat, greatly saving on the size of the boiler and the fuel constantly required.</p>
<h3>A Quick Look at Nanning</h3>
<p>— Nanning Four-Day Airmail Report, Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Traveling to and from the southern border, entering and exiting disaster areas, and staying briefly in Nanning for two days, I reside in this important border town, carefully experiencing the many changes of the past year, and I always find it both interesting and uninteresting! ...</p>
<p>Nanning, formerly known as Xuanhua, is the first and only rich area in southern Guangxi. Therefore, in the past, officials circulated a soup head song that said, "Gold is in Beiliu, silver is in Xuanhua, it doesn't matter if you don't get a noble county," because these three places were all famous lucrative posts. It was like this in the past, and it is still like this now. After being away from Nanning for many years, I have returned to this land. Not only have the stores that existed in the past not closed, but even the ones that were closed before have now opened and are doing brisk business. Bustling with activity, Guangxi's cities, with the exception of Wuzhou, are comparable. The markets in Guilin and Liuzhou are far behind!</p>
<p>This small city with a population of 130,000 is not necessarily just a business marketplace. Since the war with Vietnam, the situation has become complicated, coupled with the political turmoil of "something is about to happen in the southern fields," the people of Nanning live a tense life.</p>
<p>The bandit problem still seems to be worth noting. According to legend, the "Democratic Allied Army" based in</p>
<p>The Nanning-Guizhou Border Area</p>
<p>The "Democratic Allied Army" in the Shiwandashan Xiaodong Datang has long sought "day and night" to capture Nanning. Although they are still tossing and turning, it is enough to make people shudder. Five gold shops simultaneously received a notice to "raise military funds and jointly promote righteousness." Occasionally, a curfew is issued, and every household closes its doors tightly. It is truly an eventful autumn—in the area where Nanning, Shangsi, and Fangcheng (Guangdong) meet, the "unruly people" who live in dangerous terrain refuse to pay taxes or serve in the military, and instead collect grain and recruit soldiers, which has already become an open secret. They beat up the poor, kill the innocent, and constantly say things like "We are the Southern Route Column, we are the Communist Army." There are about 2,000 of them, gathering in the wilderness. When government troops arrive, they disappear without a trace. When government troops leave, they run rampant everywhere again. A batch recently fled into Lingshan (Guangdong), which is in the territory of Ningheng County, further increasing anxiety. Nurturing problems and allowing them to become a threat, in fact, it is no longer a time to be complacent by avoiding medical treatment.</p>
<p>Recently, a folk song has been circulating in the market, called</p>
<p>The Three Disasters of Nanning</p>
<p>: Counterfeit money, opium, and firearms. The sources of the three are generally interrelated. The abundance of counterfeit money is due to the financial difficulties of the "democratic fighters," so they loudly advocate "freedom of copying," which is beyond doubt. But opium is a sight to behold, at its peak for a time, almost every day cars and boats coming down from Baise (a small city in western Guangxi, a thoroughfare to Yunnan and Guizhou) are carrying it. The rampant momentum has made the anti-smuggling personnel overwhelmed. Open the hatches of the boats, there are two or three hundred catties. Open the car engines, there are also one or two hundred catties. Dig into the ceilings of hotels, and there are also one or two dans. A few days ago, a general ship was sealed off for carrying a large amount of opium to Yong. The state of lawlessness has made this place the greatest paradise for adventurers. It is said that transporting drugs from western Guangxi to Hong Kong and Guangdong, if you don't reveal your plans, a single turnover will yield four to ten times the profit, and about ten or eight dans pass through the ears and eyes of the military and police every day in various ways. A lot of trading also happens in Nanning. As for private sales of firearms and private guns, they are mostly the masterpieces of heroes with guns on their waists. In Shangsi County, "arsenals" are everywhere, producing homemade pistols and even fast and slow light machine guns, hand grenades, etc. The quality is still good. A pistol costs about three or four hundred thousand. Every market day, in the market</p>

<h3>Random Chat in England: Visiting Shakespeare's Hometown</h3>
<p>— Bang Shuyi</p>
<p>Two days after a Mid-Autumn Festival, we visited Cambridge University, a picturesque spot in Jiangnan, which further enhanced our interest in touring the countryside. We continued our pilgrimage to the hometown of the great English writer Shakespeare, accompanied by teachers Zheng Xiaocang and his sons Rui and Xizhen. In London, we hired Brother Chengxu, who had been living in England for a long time, as our guide, and naturally everything went smoothly on the trip! Speaking of Shakespeare's great name, everyone knows that he is a giant in the British literary world and the ancestor of the world's drama scene. Although he has been dead for more than three hundred years, his thirty-seven immortal masterpieces are like thirty-seven shining stars, forever illuminating the course of progress in the literary and art world. As I was thinking about how I should admire the sage today and what my first impression would be upon entering Shakespeare's former residence... suddenly the train stopped, and I knew we had arrived at Stratford-upon-Avon station. As we exited the station, a representative from the British Council was already there to greet us in a small car. The hotel we had booked was called "William and Mary" in the Old Town of Stratford. The hotel was named after Shakespeare's first name, William, and his mother's name, Mary, which was a very meaningful way to attract guests! The hotel was founded in 1690 and is decorated in a rather elegant style. The dining hall is decorated entirely with swords and animal skins, which the owner designed to highlight the meaning of the antique style. It took our group of five an entire day to visit Shakespeare's historical sites. The following can be recorded:</p>
<p>Shakespeare's House—including New Place and the house of Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway. This house became state property in 1847, and was returned to the original owner in 1857. In this house, you can still see many wooden and stone works from the Elizabethan era.</p>
<p>At the corner of Bridge Street, there is a Quiney House. This house was where Judith Shakespeare, Shakespeare's daughter, and her wine merchant husband lived. But now it has become a tea house. On the other side of the street is Harvard House, a half-timbered building from 1596. This house is named because Katharine Rogers lived in this house in her early years, and she later became the mother of the founder of Harvard University. This house was given to Harvard University by Mr. Edward Morris in 1909 to serve as a gathering place for American tourists.</p>
<p>In the Town Hall, there is a portrait of Shakespeare painted by Wilson.</p>
<p>At the end of Chapel Street is New Place Estate. New Place was originally the largest house in Stratford, built by Sir Hugh Clopton in 1488. Shakespeare bought it in 1547, and he died in this house. After Shakespeare's death, this house went through several disputes, and in 1757, it was torn down by Rev. Francis Gastrell, who lived there.</p>
<p>Next to this house is Nash's House, inherited by Shakespeare's granddaughter. This house has now been converted into the New Place Estate Museum, which includes memorials to Shakespeare's demolition of the house, memorials to Shakespeare's 50th anniversary, and many other interesting local items.</p>
<p>On the cover of New Place, there is a Guild Chapel, rebuilt by Sir Clopton in 1495. Connected to this chapel is a Guild Hall, a half-timbered building. On the upper floor of this building is a Grammar School, where Shakespeare began his education as a child. I researched his historical facts. His father's name was John Shakespear. He was an unknown wool merchant and grain merchant. He himself was not from a scholarly family. After studying in elementary school, he worked hard on his own to create this unprecedentedly great poet saint. I admired his all-encompassing talent, and at the same time, I couldn't help but admire the beautiful Stratford countryside on the silvery River Avon.</p>
<p>From Chapel Street to Old Town, passing through Halps Croft, this old house is said to have belonged to Shakespeare's son-in-law, Dr. John Han. We can see the famous Trinity Church next to the River Avon in the shade of the linden tree.</p>
<p>About a mile west of Stratford, a quiet path leads to Shottery, the cottage of Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway, a beautiful Elizabethan half-timbered farmhouse with a thatched roof. Everything in the room is still in its original state, with very strange beds and many other souvenirs, as well as a very attractive old-fashioned garden.</p>
<p>Impressions of this trip: First, the lovely "Stratford-upon-Avon" is truly a lovely place, but why are there so many poetic antiquities there? Of course, it is because it is the hometown of the great writer Shakespeare. According to our Chinese meaning of "a place with outstanding people," then this clean and slender River Avon is winding and beautiful, flowing quietly, with the charm of a virgin, plus the drooping green willows, brushing the green grassland by the river, the clear waves on the river reflecting the ever-changing white clouds, like children playing in the blue sky! Small sparrows jump from time to time in the shade of the trees and flowers, as if to announce that the bright silver river "Avon" has already put on a light autumn dress, welcoming the poets to wander and chant!</p>
<p>Second, the British are very conservative. At the same time, they do not forget "novelty." Therefore, in the construction plan of the city, while trying to preserve Shakespeare's antiquities, they also designed a brand-new theater, built on the banks of the historically rich Avon River. It is the world-famous Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. It is said that this theater was destroyed by fire in 1926, and was later redesigned and built by Elizabeth Scott as the most modern theater in the UK. It specializes in performing Shakespeare's famous plays. Except for (Titus Andronicus), Sir Frank Benson performed them in this theater. By the time of the annual performance season, people come from Europe and the United States to see the plays! It is conceivable that the famous play was a sensation at the time! In the Shakespeare Memorial, there is also a memorial library with tens of thousands of books. In addition to displaying Shakespeare's portraits, famous works from Shakespeare's era, as well as clips and gloves used by Shakespeare during his lifetime, are also preserved here. In the open space near the Shakespeare Memorial, there is also the Shakespeare Monument. On this trip, the teachers and Brother Rui composed many wonderful works. Because I was accompanied by a poetic friend on this visit, it seemed that I could not be without poetry, so after reading Brother Rui's "Le Mansion is famous for three hundred years, and the charm of this city has been passed down together. The boundless meaning is lingering, and the ancient road is the west wind and the evening smoke," I added a sequel, remembering that it was "The lonely poet hero is here year after year, and the Le Mansion of the ages has been passed down, the Eastern guests fly from thousands of miles away, and chant the smoke of the evening trees in this city." It can be regarded as the mud and claws of a wild goose visiting Shakespeare's hometown from thousands of miles away. Of course, the craftsmanship is not important.</p>
<h3>The Old Taoist</h3>
<p>— Li Weichu</p>
<p>It was an warm afternoon in October. At five o'clock, the bell rang for the end of the workday. Dinglingling, it called me to run out of the office. My tired back and waist felt as if it had just been relieved of a heavy burden. I felt so relaxed, so weak, so happy, and also slightly troubled. I walked from Zhonghua Road to Linjiang Road in order to hurry home to the dormitory for dinner. As I turned into Linjiang Road, the supplement page of the newspaper posted on the wall caught my attention. I stopped and stood there to watch for a little while. A voice startled me from behind:</p>
<p>"Miss, give me some money!"</p>
<p>I looked back and saw an old Taoist with snow-white hair and temples. His bright eyes seemed very timid, and his gaze was full of pleading and sincerity. I have always been soft-hearted towards the elderly. Because of this gaze and the white hair, I reached out to open my purse, but just as I opened my purse, I heard him say:</p>
<p>"Miss, give me a few more. I'll cultivate into a man in the next life!"</p>
<p>These words angered me. I thought: Just because I am a woman, I suffer so much pain and endure so much anger in this society. So many troubles and grievances in the office, and yet you, an old Taoist, a cultivator, also look down on women in the same way. - I slammed my purse shut. I don't know where the anger came from, but I blurted out to the poor old man: "Why do you want to cultivate into a man? I don't want to. I just want to be a woman!" I still thought in my heart that if there really is a next life, even if the King of Hell forces me to be a man, I will refuse. I will definitely be a woman. After I said this, I started walking, but I still heard him grumbling:</p>
<p>"It's better to cultivate into a man so you can become an official!" I still couldn't help myself, so I walked and answered him:</p>
<p>"I don't want to be an official. I don't like being an official!"</p>
<p>"Becoming an official means enjoying wealth and fortune!"</p>
<p>I faintly heard him say this, and I was even more angry. Looking back, it was such a kind of gaze, so unbearable, a timid and disappointed gaze! But at this moment, an even hotter emotion occupied me, as if a violent and surging wave had washed away a calm and gentle ripple. I couldn't soften my heart, and at the same time, I thought to myself: You, this old Taoist who cultivates and studies the Tao, are also full of fame and fortune. No wonder those men all want to become officials and get rich... As I thought this, I pouted as if I was angry with someone. By the time I walked into the dining hall, the others at the table had already finished half a bowl. Fortunately, they weren't wolfing it down. Look at the men at the other tables; many dishes had already been wiped clean.</p>
<p>"Hey, you daydreamer, hurry up and report. Why are you distracted? Why are you late?"</p>
<h3>Portrait of Madame Récamier</h3>
<p>— David</p>
<p>Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) was born in Paris. His early works were extremely immature. After studying in Rome and Greece, he returned to France and was still unknown. He was recommended to the revolutionary government by Robespierre, a giant of the French Revolution, to create large-scale murals, and he became famous in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>When Napoleon came to power, David was even more favored, so he specialized in singing the praises of the clan and became an authority in the art world at that time.</p>
<p>Until Napoleon's defeat, David was also exiled abroad, hiding in Belgium, continuing to paint, and widely accepting students, founding classicism. Among his most famous disciples were Gros (B. Gros), Ingres (J.A. Ingres), and Delacroix (E. Delacroix).</p>
<p>Representative works include "The Coronation of Napoleon," "Portrait of Madame Récamier," etc. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>A Foot of Land, A Foot of Blood 340</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Yes..." I understood what Mr. W meant; he probably wanted to say that this part after Changping, I would have to explore and advance on my own. In other words, I would have to hold onto my life, probing step by step, advancing gradually. Here, I could imagine that besides the military deployments on both sides, there were also spies from various factions, local hoodlums, bandits, and all sorts of dangerous activities. It could be said that these dozen or so miles were fraught with thorns and traps at every step. To pass through this area was like traversing a mountain of knives and a forest of arrows; the danger was indescribable. But, the mission was sacred; the mission was greater than everything else, even if it was more dangerous, I would still move forward.</p>
<p>"However," Mr. W hesitated a little, "I still can't be sure whether Miss Yao has already passed through, or is still fighting bitterly with the enemy in the Changping area, or has taken a big detour, taking another road to Zhangbei for safety. It's all impossible to know. It's no wonder she's delayed, perhaps reports are being held up along the way, just like her Tianjin telegram, which was delayed for three days. ...Besides that, Tiger Chen's whereabouts are also hard to pin down - in short, the biggest difficulty is the lack of news; it leaves people with no way to start - we'll just have to wait for a busy and difficult trip."</p>
<p>I decided to entrust all official business in Beijing to Mr. W, to handle or convey on my behalf. In order to ensure smooth information flow, of course, I had to bring "04" and two or three deputies along the way. That French-style portable wireless machine was certainly an important tool. After arriving in Shanxi, we would also rely entirely on it to handle various communication tasks. But ensuring that this priceless tool was not seized or damaged was also one of the major tasks of our trip.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, besides "04," there was also a couple, the man was called She Erheshang, people called him Erheshang, we called him Du Er, from Cangzhou, in his forties; according to him, he practiced some martial arts when he was a teenager, because it was the late Qing Dynasty, and he really wanted to take the martial arts exam to become a martial arts scholar, pass the martial arts imperial examination, and become a military officer, to bring glory to his family. But after the founding of the Republic of China, he could only change careers, working as a young soldier and groom in the army, and later becoming a cook and doing odd jobs.</p>
<p>His wife was also a native of Cangzhou. To describe her appearance and demeanor simply, she was probably like the fierce Yaksha Sun Erniang in the Water Margin's 108 heroes. Her commonly used weapon was a vajra pestle. This weapon of hers (a rolling pin) was not used for anything else, but specifically to deal with the "old teapot" in her mouth, the cook Du Er. The word "teapot" is equivalent to the southern "bastard."</p>
<p>This virtuous couple also served as cooks at our Changxindian terminal station; the man did the purchasing and cooking, and the woman did the kitchen chores and laundry. Don't look at how rough they are, when we temporarily need them to inquire about rumors, legends, news, etc., they are quite capable of using some cunning tricks. Moreover, both of them can use knives and rob; they are also very accurate with targets. Unfortunately, neither of them had read since childhood, and together they could probably write five characters, three characters being "Du Er He," which was Du's official seal; the other two characters are "Liu Shi"; that was the wife's signature. Because we had many procedures that required signatures, the two of them spent half their lives familiarizing themselves with these four and a half characters. Why only four and a half? Because the character "Liu" had too many strokes, and this fierce Yaksha Mrs. Du, no matter how hard she worked, could not draw it, so she could only use the abbreviated "Liu" character; since it was abbreviated, it could only be counted as half a character.</p>
<p>Hui said playfully, and I told them everything that had happened, which made them laugh.</p>
<p>"Then he really is an unlucky egg, he just happened to run into Miss's anger!" the little fat boy said jokingly.</p>
<p>But I still frowned, helplessly defending:</p>
<p>"In this society, don't you still know our suffering, sorrow, worries, and troubles? You can only not be angry if you are a fool, you can only not care if you are cold-hearted."</p>
<p>Due to my seriousness, the atmosphere at dinner also became heavy.</p>
<p>In the morning of the next day, in the office, when I thought of yesterday's feelings, yesterday's genuineness and lack of cultivation, I couldn't help but laugh, but when I thought of that poor old Taoist, who was hit with the nail by me out of nowhere, how could he know the cause hidden in my heart? That snow-white beard and hair, the decrepit state, the timid, expectant gaze, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of shame and repentance! I blamed myself, I thought why I was so easily angered? I thought why I didn't give him the money before getting angry? I thought that when I suddenly closed the opened bag, my face changed, and angry words came out inexplicably, wasn't it a very sad blow to his heart at that time? Wouldn't that poor heart be deeply disappointed, saddened by an undeserved loss? Thinking like this, I really felt regretful and sad, an indescribable emotion invaded me, in the absence of anything else, I could only pray silently, hoping that I would meet him again somewhere, then I would give him a lot more money, and let me use my heart, my eyes, my attitude, to sincerely express my joy to him. At dusk, everyone rushed to the restaurant, but I wandered alone on that road, waiting, searching, hoping to find the figure with snow-white beard and hair, but on the second day, the third day, the fourth day, until today, I have never met him. And my thoughts of him, until today, cannot be relieved.</p>
<p>Old Taoist! Old Taoist with snow-white beard and hair! Where did you go? In this expensive, difficult city, how are you begging? Where did you go to beg? - I often think to myself: "May your begging fingers always receive the gifts and warmth of kind-hearted people, and never meet someone as rude as me who makes your heart suffer!" I also often pray silently in my heart, as if only in this way can I slightly reduce the unease in my heart.</p>
<h3>### A Thousand Years of Irish Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Irish poetry is much older than the English epic "Beowulf." "A Thousand Years of Irish Poetry," compiled by Miss K. Hoaglan, begins with Amergin, who was born several centuries before Jesus. In early Ireland, the power of official poets was second only to that of emperors. During the rise of Irish culture, even the English King Alfred left his country and bowed down at the feet of the Irish clergy. This king wrote poetry under the pseudonym of the Scottish Highland Gaels.</p>
<p>This anthology of a thousand years of Irish poetry is the first collection of Scottish Highland and Anglo-Irish poets, making a great contribution to world literature. Apart from Greece, Irish poetry is the oldest and purest literature in Europe. Its cultural influences include ice age legends, the Nibelungenlied, and the Australian romance "Gudrunlied." Queen Mab in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" comes from the Irish Maeve; Puck comes from the ancient Irish Puca.</p>
<p>The editor also introduced two major satirical poems, one is the 14th-century "Land of Cockaigne," and the other is the 18th-century "Midnight Court." She specifically stated that Swift, Goldsmith, Wilde, Sheridan, and other writers, who are often considered English, are actually Irish and should have their citizenship returned to them.</p>
<p>This collection of poems includes the Irish underground resistance to English tyranny, as well as desolate poems, and many humorous and joyful poems. There are also drinking songs and prayer songs.</p>
<p>This collection of poems can be called a sea of poetry. The two wings of Icarus soar, scattering in the wind and waves. Romantic love, the passion for land, the desire for freedom, mysteriously united with nature - these are all the voices of the Irish people, expressed in the last poem of this collection.</p>
<p>Miss Hoaglan's preface details the history of Irish poetry, and there is also a timeline of major events.</p>
<h3>### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Fang Hui's "Kuilv Sui" records: When Xia Song was guarding Anzhou, Song Xiang's brothers were traveling and studying as commoners. At the banquet, they each composed poems on falling flowers. Song thought they had the talent to assist the government. Zhao Lingzhi's "Hou Qing Lu" also said: "The two Song's poems on falling flowers were very popular at the time. In fact, these poems on falling flowers are just in the style of the late Tang Dynasty, and have not fully shown their strengths. For example, Song Xiang's poem on West Lake, 'Opening up a place where fish and birds forget their feelings, unfolding a vast view of rivers and lakes,' is the best." Xiang's "Yuan Xian Collection" has thirty-six volumes, with brilliant lines of poetry appearing frequently, such as the inscription on the mixed scenery of the pond behind Gaoming Hall: "Frogs are angry and love to call before the rain, swallows often fly against the wind"; observing things in the small garden in late spring: "New bamboo occasionally emerges with withered bamboo, wild flowers idly embrace old vines." These couplets are extremely beautiful and outstanding.</p>
<h3>### On "Elections"</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Last year, a so-called popular election of Bao Chiefs was held, which caused many ridiculous scenes at the time; fake election votes were stuffed into the ballot box in large quantities. Two groups were evenly matched, and this even caused a group fight. From the perspective of a newly implemented constitutional government, our people and popular opinion institutions still need to learn and practice hard.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have always been unaccustomed to the rights that people in democratic countries should enjoy. They have always been indifferent to popular elections. Therefore, although the government has delegated the election to the people, most people have not made good use of this basic right.</p>
<p>You see, when Truman drove back to Washington from Virginia on July 6, because the car was driving too fast, the New York Times wrote an article, "Too Fast, Mr. President," criticizing the American president.</p>
<p>In the United States, the exercise of this basic right of the people is extremely common in a democratic country.</p>
<p>And this year's Bao Chief election is again making a fuss about "illegal votes" and "Bao people filing lawsuits," etc. If the British and American countries see this, how can people not feel ashamed to death!</p>
<p>We must make every citizen understand and participate in every activity that people should participate in during the constitutional era. In every district and every Bao, we must make people accustomed to all democratic activities, then, of course, there will be no more evil habits of "illegal voting" in these "popular elections."</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Elizabeth and Mountbatten</h3>
<p>— Lei Ying</p>
<p>The future Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth, has already turned twenty-one this year. On the day of her twenty-first birthday, someone predicted that she might get engaged this year, because she was unfortunately born into the royal family and must be of age to be eligible for engagement.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the ninth of this month, Buckingham Palace finally announced the good news that the King had formally agreed to her engagement to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. Buckingham Palace specially held a grand tea party on the tenth to celebrate the auspicious event. The new couple happily attended, and the wedding ceremony will probably not be far away.</p>
<p>Mountbatten was originally Prince Philip of Greece, the sixth in line to the throne, but this year he resolutely abandoned his nationality and his title, and became a lieutenant in the British Navy. Since he is a soldier, of course he has his own work, but Princess Elizabeth is deeply in love with him, and she always sends him three letters every week. If he happens to be on leave in England, then he is always a frequent visitor to Windsor Castle. Elizabeth's younger sister, the clever sixteen-year-old Princess Margaret, often teases her sister about Philip, but, according to a guest in the royal family, he has never seen Elizabeth get angry because of this teasing.</p>
<p>Elizabeth is an extremely filial daughter, she can almost be said to worship her father - just like King George VI, she does not relax on any small details, likes outdoor sports, and hates people who talk too much; but many people say that her personality is still somewhat like her "Uncle David," that is, the abdicated Emperor Edward VIII, the current Duke of Windsor, who resolutely abandoned his honor for love. They equally like to be close to commoners and hate excessive etiquette and restraint. Philip also giving up the right to inherit the throne naturally etched himself deeper into Elizabeth's heart.</p>
<p>As early as when she was four years old, people were already looking for a future husband for Princess Elizabeth. One British magazine even published a list that year, listing eight promising candidates. For a time, there were rumors that she was going to be engaged to Prince George of Denmark; and it was said that Prince Charles of Belgium, who was twenty-five years older than her, was also very promising. For a while, she was very close to the handsome Marquis of Euston, but the Marquis was soon sent to India and quietly went to work in the Governor's Palace.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and Mountbatten knew each other when they were young. They were originally cousins. As children, they often met at the home of his maternal uncle, Lord Mountbatten (the current Governor-General of India). He left Greece when he was just one year old and lived in his maternal uncle's residence. Later, he studied naval warfare in the UK and graduated from Dartmouth Naval College with the highest honors. He then joined the British Navy. He participated in the landing in Sicily on the battleship "Valiant" and also witnessed the grand ceremony of Japan's surrender in Tokyo Bay. But he only returned to Greece once after growing up, staying for a few weeks. He doesn't speak Greek at all.</p>
<p>Initially, the King and Queen of England were not very satisfied with Mountbatten - mainly because he was Greek. Mountbatten repeatedly requested to obtain British citizenship, but he was unsuccessful twice in a row, and it was not until the third time that he finally got his wish.</p>
<p>But, Elizabeth has come of age this year, and the engagement has finally been announced - hasn't it already been said above that her personality is somewhat similar to that of her rather stubborn "Uncle David"?</p>
<h3>### The Status of Confucianism</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>After Emperor Shizu of Yuan destroyed the Southern Song Dynasty and unified China, his institutions and systems were based on the best of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties, and also incorporated the remnants of the four great Khanates. After establishing his capital in Beijing, he ordered the formulation of these systems, among which the most prominent were the racial hierarchy and the occupational ranking. In the former, the Yuan people divided racial hierarchy into four: first, the Mongols; second, the Semu people; third, the Southern Chinese; and last, the Han Chinese. The Mongols were naturally the masters of the country. The Semu people were from the four great Khanates, that is, the various ethnic groups of Eastern and Near Europe today. The Southern Chinese were the Han Chinese who had long lived in the lands of Liao and Jin, and had been conquered earlier. The Han Chinese were the survivors of the Southern Song Dynasty. The hierarchy of these four was strictly enforced, and they did not assimilate with each other until the fall of the Yuan Dynasty. In the latter, the Yuan people also divided occupational rankings into: first, officials; second, clerks; third, monks; fourth, Taoists; fifth, doctors; sixth, craftsmen; seventh, artisans; eighth, prostitutes; ninth, Confucian scholars; and tenth, beggars. Placing Confucian scholars above beggars and below prostitutes can truly be called the greatest joke in the world. Since the worship of Confucianism by Emperor Wu of Han, Confucian thought has controlled society for thousands of years. Now, to reverse this and violate the order is bound to cause the "Confucian scholars" to rise up and be irreconcilable. However, the fact that this did not happen (as evidenced by Xu Heng and Yu Ji serving the Yuan Dynasty) shows that the influence of Confucianism had reached its limit by the Yuan Dynasty. Although the later Yuan Dynasty was short-lived, its downfall was not due to the belittling of Confucianism. Moreover, Zhu Yuanzhang, Chen Youliang, Zhang Shicheng, and others had even less connection with Confucianism. So, what is a "Confucian scholar"? They are simply opportunists who regard themselves as the ruling class, serving when there is order and retreating when there is chaos.</p>
<h3>### American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Zitu</p>
<p>Fountain Pen Gas Guns and Others</p>
<p>If you pay attention to small stores in the United States, you can buy countless small things, such as flashlights as small as lipsticks, radios smaller than the palm of your hand, cameras the size of watches, scales no more than five inches long, eight-power binoculars for ninety-five cents, foldable bathtubs, clotheslines that can be attached to the wall, calendars smaller than dominoes, calculators the size of matchboxes, phonograph records printed on paper strips, alarm clocks smaller than matchboxes, electric boats that can be folded and placed in a suitcase (not toys), diamond rings for six dollars each (not fake), pistols for ten dollars each (Lincoln brand), and fountain pen gas guns. Plainclothes detectives all carry this type of fountain pen. Ordinary thugs only notice the guns on the police's waists, but they don't notice the fountain pens in the plainclothes detectives' suit pockets. The gas released is mostly tear gas. The amount of gas released by one pen is probably enough to make twelve thugs cry. The people who use fountain pen gas guns are not limited to the police. Many women active in social settings can also find these things in their handbags. When they encounter unscrupulous men, this fountain pen can become their amulet. There are many shops selling fountain pen gas guns. They advertise in detective magazines such as True Detective Stories, etc. Each pen costs only about ten dollars. Fountain pen-shaped pistols for women are also available, but they are more expensive, about fifty dollars or more. Ordinary Colt No. 3 pistols for women cost only about thirty dollars. In addition, there are typewriter-style tabletop pianos. Press the music score on the typewriter to become the rhythm. There are small elevators for use in small families, which can be installed for several hundred dollars. There are also things that are extremely large and incredibly cheap. There are flying fortresses for one thousand five hundred dollars each. As long as you have the ability to move them away, you can choose from B-17, B-24, B-29. There are aircraft runways that can be rolled up into bedding, which can be bought to replace the cable bridge in Guan County, Sichuan. There are amphibious small airplanes, placed in car store windows for sale. (17)</p>
<h3>### "Buridan's Donkey"</h3>
<p>— Wang Jue</p>
<p>Between 1300 and 1358, there was a popular metaphor in France, which was first spoken by the philosopher Buridan. He said:</p>
<p>Suppose there are two piles of hay placed in front of a donkey, and the volume of the hay is the same. This donkey hesitates between these two piles of hay of the same volume, not knowing which pile to choose to eat first? It wanders left and right, circling until it is dizzy, and as a result, it starves to death alive. This satire was very famous at the time, and everyone talked about "Buridan's Donkey," which became a commonly used term.</p>
<p>Even today, we still often encounter "Buridan's Donkey" type of characters in this world. Even if they don't starve to death because they don't know which to choose by circling left and right, they should crash to death or die miserably because they don't know which to choose by continuing left and right.</p>
<p>The donkey is the representative of clumsiness in the West. They often scold people as Donkey or Ass. This Donkey or Ass has the meaning of idiot and fool in addition to its original meaning. Sometimes Chinese people cannot agree with the donkey's opinion, but they will show off a little cleverness. For example, Sun Quan in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms ridiculed Zhuge Ziyu, who had a long face, by hanging a plaque with the name "Zhuge Ziyu" written on it on his head, and making fun of him in front of Zhuge Ziyu during the banquet. However, his young son, named Ke, borrowed a pen and added the two characters "Zhi Donkey" under his father's name, becoming "Zhuge Ziyu's Donkey." Then his father was no longer the object of ridicule. This naturally won the laughter and praise of the audience. Zhuge Ke's reputation as a child prodigy spread far and wide, and has continued to this day.</p>
<p>But this can only be told as an anecdote or a good story, and it still cannot solve the satire of "Buridan's Donkey" for mankind.</p>
<p>Only poets sometimes tell the truth. Su Dongpo's fourteen short poems sent to his nephew Anjin have two lines that say: "Should laugh at the clumsiness of making a living, spinning around like a millstone." He honestly admitted that for the sake of life, he was spinning around like a donkey in a mill. In fact, this is definitely not just Su Dongpo. Who can truly avoid the predicament of "Buridan's Donkey"?</p>
<p>A book written by a Japanese person said: "The national celebration of a country full of donkeys, that mood, cannot be appreciated by anyone who has not traveled through China from south to north and witnessed the scene of hired mules hurrying along the mountains and rivers."</p>
<p>This seems to be intentionally insulting the Chinese, but in fact, not only Chinese people, but also Japanese people, and even people in all countries in the world, cannot avoid being a donkey.</p>
<p>Mr. Buridan is indeed a prophet, worthy of being a philosopher.</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Epiphyllum</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>Last year, on July 26th, at 8:40 PM, two pots of Epiphyllum cultivated by Mr. Chen Jue Wu at 92 Huanghe Road in this city simultaneously bloomed, each with a single flower. The next day, newspapers all reported on it. A reporter from a certain newspaper used quite beautiful language to describe it as follows:</p>
<p>"Under the strong light of electric lamps, between the thick and lush green leaves, two Epiphyllum flowers gradually opened. The stems of the pinkish-purple sepals were as slender as wild lilies, truly deserving to be called 'pink necks.' She lowered her head shyly, but in that instant, she had mustered the courage to slightly raise her pink face and open her blushed petals. The petals were slightly red and purely transparent, very much like peonies, with a tuft of stamens in the center, the color appearing pinkish-yellow, resembling the stamens of lotus flowers."</p>
<p>The shape of the stems and leaves was: "There were three or four hard stems and about twenty leaves. The shape of the leaves was like a cactus, with branching leaves splitting from the pinnate petioles, and new leaves growing on the leaves. The growth process of the Epiphyllum was originally the same as that of the leaves. Even more strangely, the stems of the flowers emerged directly from the edges of the leaves."</p>
<p>Recently, on the afternoon of the Seventh-Seventh Anniversary, at 7:00 PM, an Epiphyllum planted by the Shandong Native Place Association on Ximen Road also bloomed. According to the record, "Its shape is somewhat similar to a white begonia chrysanthemum, especially the receptacle is exactly like a chrysanthemum. The color of the petals is white, the color of the stamens is dark yellow, and the color of the receptacle is slightly lighter than the stamens. It was largest at ten o'clock after opening, about eight inches in diameter; the strangest thing is that the stamens are particularly large, and in the middle of the stamens, there is another hanging flower shape (?). The flower stem is like a lotus seedpod stem, but it is grown on a small wooden frame. The shape of the flower is not peculiar, but the emerald green sepal is strangely lovely."</p>
<p>The aforementioned Epiphyllum cultivated by Mr. Chen Jue Wu also bloomed this year and was publicly exhibited for charity at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road on the evening of the 9th, when many people had already seen the true appearance of the Epiphyllum.</p>
<p>Last September, a Suzhou newspaper recorded the morphology of the Epiphyllum cultivated in the Tan Family Garden in Wujin, which was even more concise: "Two buds grow on the flower stalks at the lower end of the deep green leaves, the stalks are purplish-brown, the flowers are white as jade, the petals are like ribbons, with more than twenty petals, slightly like chrysanthemums, the stamens are slender and soft, with a stem in the middle, like a small flower, shaped like a dragon claw chrysanthemum, standing upright in between, like a leech's tongue stretching out."</p>
<p>Combining the above records, we can roughly conclude that Epiphyllum is a kind of cactus plant. The leaves of cactus plants often degenerate, the stems are fleshy and green, which in botany is called a cladode—a type of modified stem. In the previous text, "The shape of the leaves is like a cactus," "Two buds grow on the flower stalks at the lower end of the deep green leaves," the so-called "leaves" are all mistakes for "branches."</p>
<p>Although the descriptions of the flower's morphology are beautiful, because they do not use common botanical terms such as corolla, pistil, stamen, ovary, anther, etc. to make detailed and analytical descriptions, just like the records of animal and plant morphology in old books, they are too simple and vague. After reading, people cannot get a clear impression, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Recently, Epiphyllum has bloomed, and the editor specially invited Mr. Jia Zuzhang to write about the Epiphyllum so that further views could be provided. The first part is published here, and there are two more parts, middle and lower, which will be published continuously in one or two days. According to the author, the middle part is written as "An Eyewitness Account of Epiphyllum"; the lower part will make a slight textual research. We hope readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>"Japanese People"</h3>
<p>— Ya Ludi</p>
<p>The Japanese people's fickleness and the prostitute-like behavior of changing allegiances at dawn and dusk have long been known to the world. They are thorough opportunists. In the last war, they suddenly asked Matsuoka to present a folding screen to Stalin, then suddenly fought the Soviet Union at Zhanggufeng, then sent Nomura and Kurusu bustling to the White House, and then suddenly wiped out the American fleet at Pearl Harbor with stealthy movements. From shocking the world for a time to surrendering with bowed heads, it was almost only as long as from the flourishing to the withering of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>They exhausted their flattery and adulation by offering poems and essays of praise to MacArthur, praising the ways of Western democracies to the skies. All Japanese people know what this is all about, and they agree with this behavior, as it often brings them practical benefits. Now, they are even asking to form an army, casting a flirtatious glance and acting coy for a while. The Japanese people's "acting" has truly reached a state of perfection.</p>
<p>However, the young men in Tokyo are ultimately more straightforward and do not like to put on airs. They despise Americans. When vehicles carrying Americans pass by, they throw stones and shout abuse, forcing the passengers on the vehicles to lower the curtains. Also, when an American is walking down the street, suddenly a Japanese person rushes towards them, stands in front of them without moving, and rolls their eyes at them while blocking their way. The walking American has no choice but to make way and take a detour.</p>
<p>No matter how they wear coats or masks, the Japanese people ultimately cannot change.</p>
