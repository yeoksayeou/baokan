<p>〔本報瀋陽二日電〕杜聿明對記者表示長春軍調分部共方人員，願赴平赴哈，我方決負責送回。至東北前途，則仍　政府命令辦理，我方決不首先進攻，至外間測將有大戰發生，未免方之過早，杜氏稱：決盡力保護交通安全，並決在長春，瀋陽，錦州，山海關各地，澈底整理交通秩序。馬占山副長官，日內即將來瀋，其所屬部隊，將一併前來。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕軍調部共產黨人員，可能於五日開始撤退。共產黨一日自美方照會提出撤關係，共產黨尙未答覆。共產黨前派往長春調査電台事件之王良科，今下午已返抵平。據稱：長春共產黨電台，確經政會發還，現彼處人員，亦正準備撤退中。據共產黨方面稱：截至今日，延安尙未有指示到平，關於軍調部共產黨人員之調遺，亦無明令發表。共產黨對此次軍調部之解散，似持愼重而不感興趣之態度。某共產黨要員吿記者：美方人員雖明令撤出，但國共兩方並未下令解散軍調部，故其今日之解散，似不合法，彼認爲應以另外方式，對軍調部作正式結束。</p>

<h3>青年黨意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京日電〕靑年黨發言人左舜生頃談稱：政府若不闡明能態度，則本黨不擬參加政府之改組。本黨行動路綫，國家觀念重於政治觀念。將來之行政院長，其人應得共和國總統之信任，享有國際聲譽，爲各黨所擁護，並應爲理財專家。不寗唯是，改組政府與改組國府委員會，改組行政院及改組地方政府同時進行，國府委員會中之共黨席次，應始終予以保留。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城返抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕吳鐵城二日七時由滬返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勱氏預定在短期內發表論文十八篇，作爲民社黨「黨義」之基礎。並擬在本年之內，赴各省重要城市作公開講演，邊疆省份則擬至省會爲止。至於中共之控制　區，因限制太多，不擬前往。</p>

<h3>改組政府等問題　民社黨盼政府提出辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕民社黨將勻田，前於舊歷除夕返皖故里度歲，旋接雷震自滬去電，促其早日赴滬，共商國事，蔣業於卅一日抵京，並定三日訪政府要中吳鐵城，邵力子，定三日夜車赴滬。記者頃訪蔣，詢以民社黨參加改組政府之意見，承談如次：民社黨自參加國大後，對於行憲之責即不能推諉，故參加改組政府，其基本原則當不變，惟目前尙作考慮者，實有以下兩點：（一）廿年來。一黨局面所造成之政治風氣，如不能改進，則民社參加政府後，是否能使之煥然一新，對國家危機有所挽救。（二）民社與政府共同制定憲法，其對行憲之責，決不推卸，但對此局勢，如不更改，則是否負起行憲之責，尙無把握。又據蔣稱：本日南京某晚報所載，左爵生談話謂：「民社黨張君　與民盟張東蓀，又有多少瓜葛」等語，並非事實，因本黨頃正考慮上列兩項問題，決非所謂「牽牽掣掣」顧到私交問題也。</p>

<h3>解決遠東問題　美蘇應先撤軍　美軍華德報發表評論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約一日電〕霍華德報今日社論山稱；「我人已在波蘭與南斯拉夫等地得見莫斯科式之「聯合政府」，實不欲再見此種聯　政府之出現。美蘇在遠東殊有成立協定之必要，然苜需撤退在朝鮮·滿州及中國各解放地之美蘇軍隊，如是則各該國之人民才得依照其一己之需要與志願，自由組織其自己之政府，此爲大西洋憲章之規定，且由俄國在德黑蘭與耶爾泰加以承認者也」。</p>

<h3>和平運動發起人　對時局畫面談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕和平運動發起人，頃對時局發表書面談話如下：</p>
<p>吾人發起此一運動之月的，實慶於目前之兵　，內足以　滅國本，外足以招致外侮。尤以對日和的會議將開，如中國不能以和平統一之局出現於國際舞台，則八年苦戰之功，可能毀於一且。竊思今日兵禍歷久不止者，一由以武力從事政爭之　習猶存，二則由左右袒（Partisanship）之空氣，對於戰事均爲一種鼓勵。吾人以爲鼓勵性之偏見愈少，戰爭必愈能早日結束，故發起此一遝動之時，即堅持兩項精神，一爲超黨派之公正精神，二爲無政治企圖之純潔精神。工商及自由職業者，無偏袒及政治企圖之必要，而盼望和平之心，亦最急切，故自爲參加者之主幹。吾人深信，全國公正意見一日集中，即能有偉大無比之追德力量，此即吾人四項公約（見一月卅一日各報）所包含之內容是也。自一二六宣言發出以後，各方或表重視，此固切望和平，人同此心，而亦爲吾人之公正不阿，足與世共見也。一二六宣言發表以後，吾人曾得普遍之同情，然亦有對吾人賜敦者，的可分爲五類，一謂吾人應形成一種組織，成爲新第三方面，吾人可答曰，第幾方面，仍爲客氣之詞，吾人愛國民，亦即主人，無第幾方面可言。二謂吾人應與雙方接洽，參加調解，吾人又可答曰，雙方果能重開　判，吾人抱歡迎及觀察態度，但無意捲人統渦，吾人之呼籲和平，與其謂爲請求式的，母寗謂之爲督促式的，此爲現代國民應有之態度。第三·第四兩種主張，則或　吾人應助田反乙，或謂應助乙反甲，吾人更可答曰，此均揚湯止沸之舉，而必須絕對避免者，蓋無論偏袒任何一方面，均足以鼓　戰爭而不利於和平。最後尚有勸吾人須明是非者，今戰爭方酣，追溯旣往，徒使問題責趨紛歧，國民之所求者，早一時一分實現和平統一民主而已，此吾人對於一二六以前之種種，不欲加以評判者也，今日之是非如何，可云和平即是一是一，不和平即是「非」。</p>
<p>吾人決本一二六宣言及四大公約之精神，織續呼籲，價至和平實現爲止，無論戰事形勢如阿，作戰理由爲何，吾人所希望者，僅爲隨時隨地立即停戰，達到和平統一，實現民主。吾人深信，全國人民一致以主人立塲，發揮公論力量，必能早日促成和平，目前吾人正廣徵各界簽名加入發起，任何職業人士，凡不爲黨派私見所拘束者，均表歡迎，此後將在全國各地進行廣泛之呼籲和平簽名，並將推定代表，分赴各大都市，如南京·平·津·重慶·武漢·廣州等處，與當地超然於黨派私見外之工商及其他　　人士聯絡，共同從事此一運動，期以全織之公論力量，終止自減性之內，最後，吾人喚起國人注意一嚴重事實，即美國退出調人地位以復，對日間題，會議以前，國民自行解決國是，之責任愈加重大，美國　解之未能成功，吾人深表痛惜，今日國內問題，在於國人自行解決，已爲各方一致之認識，此亦即吾人發起此一運動之意義。吾人深信，此一公正之和平運動精神，深入全國人心之時，即爲和平實現之日，國民須自知爲國家之主人，堅信公論，始爲最不可抗之力量，確認促成和平統一民主，實自救救國之共同大道。</p>

<h3>社論　秀視巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>戰後英國最感棘手的巴勒斯坦問題，經過整整兩年的紛擾·恐怖·流血，終於發展到最嚴重的階段，猶太恐怖份子的暴行，愈演愈烈，去年七月間耶路撒冷的英軍司令部「大衛王旅館曾遭猶太地下組織伊爾根黨的爆炸；到了今年一月下旬，英國僑民二人一爲溫特漢法官，另爲柯林斯少校，又被猶太恐怖份子綁去。凡在巴勒斯坦的英國僑民，人人自危，莫不惶惶然不可終日，因此使英國高級專員克寧漢將軍不得不採取緊急安全措置，一方面在猶太各城實行宵禁及戒備，另一方面將襲擊　令部的猶太人葛羅納判處死刑。這樣使猶太人的情緒，不啻火上添汕，益趨緊張，恐怖暴行處處可見，幾使這塊聖地成爲恐怖的地獄。於是英國政府當局爲保護僑民的生命財產的安全起見，乃於上月卅一日下令英國婦孺先行撒退回國，同時又令政府人員進入安全地帶。英國採取這種緊急安全措置之後，全世界的視綫也就集中在這個巴勒斯坦問題上了。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦在第一次大戰之後，原是英國的委任統治地；但在第二次大戰之後，巴勒斯坦的猶阿之爭怎樣安排？在英國看來，當然也是一個極嚴重的問題。起初英國拉住了美國，共同組織了一個聯合調查團，到巴勒斯坦去實地調查，結果發了一個報告書，建議先移殖十萬猶太人到巴勒斯坦去。但在巴勒斯坦境內，猶太人與阿刺伯人，因爲了種族上的歧視與經濟上的競爭，幾乎成爲兩個水火不相容的民族，英美建議先移十萬猶太人到巴勒斯坦去，自然要引起阿剌伯人的反對，阿刺伯人住在巴勒斯坦，己有幾百年的歷史，早己認爲巴勒斯坦是阿刺伯人自己的地方了。怎能容忍大批異族移入境內呢？何况猶太人不論在知識上財力上，都比較阿刺伯人優越呢？</p>
<p>英國對巴勒斯坦所採取的政策，在其本身就是一個矛盾，英國一方面贊成猶太人移往巴勒斯坦，而另一方面又主張扶植阿刺伯民族的統一運動，一九四三年艾登任外相期內，並會聲明英國願促成阿刺伯聯盟約產生。但是英國採取這種矛盾政策的結果，竟引起猶太人與阿刺伯人雙方的不滿，所謂「兩面不討好」，因此英國殖民部便擬就了兩個方案，第一個擬請美國駐兵巴勒斯坦，以保護猶太人入境；第二個則想把巴勒斯坦劃分爲兩個聯邦，這就是我們所謂的猶阿分治。關於前者，要美國駐兵巴勒斯坦，不啻要美國火中取栗，杜魯門總統對於此事的利害得失，當能洞若觀火；英國的如意算盤，自無實現的可能。至於後者，將巴勒斯坦劃分爲兩個聯邦，英國要實行這個計劃，首應徵得阿剌伯人與猶太人的同意，因此英國殖民部便決定於去年九月九日在倫敦召開巴勒斯坦圓桌會議，但是到會議開慕的一天，阿刺伯代表首先表示：「巴勒斯坦應屬於我人；巴勒斯坦與猶太人，毫無關係，猶太難民問題，需要多方合作始能解決，」此在猶太人，他們所要求的，是復國；他們所希望的，是獨立。對於英國分治的計劃，也不感興趣，故猶太人始終未派代表出席。倫敦會議在暗淡的空氣中開幕，未及十日也就陷於停頓狀態了。</p>
<p>當英國無法解決巴勒斯坦問題的時候，杜魯門總統忽又發表協助猶太人的聲明，主張猶太難民立即大批移殖巴勒斯坦，並贊成猶太人在巴勒斯坦境內，建立猶太國。而對於英國所欲實行的猶阿分治的計劃，則表示異議。因此使巴勒斯坦問題更加複雜，更加微妙了；英國分治計劃，不僅爲猶阿雙方所不滿，而且美國也表示反對，英美步調的異趨，只有使英國所處的立塲，更加困難更加脆弱。其後英國殖民部與外務部雖仍作極大的努力，希望此一問題能獲得圓滿解決；但也深知此一間題的棘手，鮮有圓淸解決的把握，故決定將此事至今年一月杪巴勒斯坦會議復會時，作最後決議。依據貝文外相的預定的計劃，巴勒斯坦會議如再失敗，則英國擬將此一問題提請聯合國大會處理。</p>
<p>現在倫敦圓桌會議己經如期復會了，不僅巴勒斯坦問題沒有澈底解決的希望，而且巴勒斯坦局勢較前更爲嚴重，使英國政府不得不下令撒退婦孺；預料巴勒斯坦問題，除了由英國至來秋提請聯合國大會解決而外，實在找不出第二條道路。這是戰後英國外交的苦悶，同時也是現時代的悲劇。</p>

<h3>春節悄然過去　鎭江各業　尙未全部上市</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江訊〕春節己在風雪中悄然過去，而各業仍遲遲未能全部上市，記者以此事甚爲各方關懷，特走訪本邑金融界某鉅子，即詢對此有無救濟對策，據稱：此種現象，不獨鎭地如此，即其他各地亦然，惟官辦銀行，雖四聯總處已有命令囑寬放工商貸款，以謀救濟，但以各銀行本身之立場關係，故祗能經營一般放款，即貨物抵押放款，其他如不動產抵押放款，江蘇銀行曾一度做過，但以該行頭寸短少，故僅放出六七千萬元即吿停止，目前中農雖亦經營建築放款業務，但以總行命令少做，故限制亦頗嚴裕，至央行爲銀行之銀行，其放款對象似僅爲銀行，故亦愛莫能助。最近金融市塲幸尙無大波動，今後商塲如各自善爲運用本能，其前途自可較爲好轉。</p>

<h3>要求文展易地開放</h3>
<p>這一次北四川路横浜橋抗戰文物展覽，意義極爲重大，各報頗予以好評，向時因準備大考無暇往觀，又因一·二路電車擁擠不堪，住在南區的我，要冒這麼大的困難在北區參觀展覽，至爲不便。今提議將該文物展覽移至中區開放數日，如靑年會（八仙橋）大新公司等處，俾我等靑年，對抗戰艱苦過程，窺見一斑，得了解抗戰事業之偉大和民族奮鬥之不易。（余冠鰲）一，二十日</p>
<h3>學級公考的建議</h3>
<p>戰後百業亟待建設，尤其敎育方面，更要格外努力。敎育當局，雖然公佈了學費限額，但要照那限額去找學校，是很困難的。况旦窮家子弟終少有入正式學校的機會。但是堅苦自學的靑年，因爲沒有資格證明文件可以得到，在他們求學的勇氣上，受了不知有多少打擊。</p>
<p>要扶助這些求學如渴的人們達到成功的目標，使他們個個成爲優秀的國民，敎育當局，實在負有督導獎勵的責任。這種任務怎樣可以完成，就是舉辦學級公考。學級公考的舉辦，就是由敎育當局，派員考試自修求學的學識是否及格，及格者給予學級證明書，其資格與同等的正式學校要相同，以後不論是升學或服務，均得作爲正式的證件。考試當然要嚴格，以試探其眞才，使其努力上進。現在急須舉辦的，是初中·高中·大學三種學級公考，其考試的决數可以訂爲：每年一次，或每二年一次。這樣自修的人，或自己研究的人，才能有興趣，有出路，另外還可以鼓勵正式學校的學生，勤學努力上進。不然；他們學識也會被人不信任的。投考的人，不拘男女老幼，均可應考，這樣可以提高國民敎育的水準，同時也增强了文化國防的邊圉。（周作霖）</p>

<h3>中東英人作秘密活動　外約但陳兵叙邊　企圖實現「大叙利亞」計劃　俾打開巴勒斯坦問題僵局</h3>
<p>〔合衆社開羅一日電〕阿拉伯語「約姆」週報本日載稱：外的但軍隊刻正集中叙利亞邊境，國王阿勃社拉並擬用武力開入叙利亞。此間阿拉伯人士對此未表驚奇，並稱，此事如果屬實，則有兩訊威：（一）阿勃社拉爲實現其成立「大叙利亞」之野心，欲併吞叙利亞。（二）爲便利解決巴勒斯坦之僵局起見，將巴勒斯坦之阿拉伯部分，倂入大叙利亞之內，而成立區域較小之猶太族巴勒斯坦。該戰並稱，外的但大致將造成某種事件，作爲開入叙利亞之藉口。英國特務人員曾秘密鼓勵阿勃社拉，有利用阿氏以解決巴勒斯坦問題之遠大眼光云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷一日電〕據未證實消息稱，外的但王阿勃社拉允儘量收容自巴勒斯坦撒退頣赴外久但之英國婦孺。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約一日電〕美國名作家即自由巴勒斯坦聯盟副主席勃朗姆斐爾特本日談稱，英婦孺退出巴勒斯坦使人想起英國將向猶太人民發動眞正的戰爭，英國在愛爾蘭及印度早已鑄成大錯，而今又在巴勒斯坦重蹈覆轍，一誤再誤，殊可扼腕。須知人民之意志固爲不可抑制者也，猶太復國運動與英方合作，共同鎮壓巴勒斯坦猶太人反抗運動，亦屬非是云。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦英駐軍　佈鐵綱如臨大敵　必要時將實施戒嚴　猶太恐怖黨表示奮鬥決心</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷一日電〕此間謠傳判處死刑之猶太地下運動份子格魯納，將於下星期二絞決，英軍今日冒雨在各處布置新鐵絲網，加强防禦，並與警察合組巡邏隊，每隊八人至十人。耶路撒冷若干猶太人區域，被一重鐵絲網劃分爲半哩見方之圈攔。據可靠方面稱，巴勒斯坦政府已通告猶太公會領袖，格魯納如執行絞刑，巴勒斯坦將實施宵禁廿四小時。恐怖團號若發生暴動，並將在若干部份施行戒嚴。格氏現在耶路撒冷獄中，其起草之上訴狀仍未簽字。耶路撒冷加太孟區有房屋二十宅，外用雙層鐵絲網圍繞，大的係供奉命遷入安全區之政府官員應用。軍界曾開緊急會議，顯係討論維持治安辦法。巴勒斯坦政府昨令英婦孺一律於下週二撒退。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷一白電〕英籍婦孺積極準備撒退聲中，台拉維夫發現伊爾根黨之傳單炸彈聲稱，該黨將繼續進行其與英人之戰鬥。撒退二千戶英國家屬之工作，定於星期二開始，屆時將由陸空兩路，將撒退人員輸往輪船口岸。巴勒斯坦英陸空軍高級人負以及警務最高當局，今日曾在耶城英車總部召開歷時四十五分鐘之極端秘密會議，猶太協會執委會，亦有緊急會議之召開。億英軍總司令巴格將軍已於今夜離耶城赴海發，同時猶太恐怖犯葛羅納被判死刑後延期執行之期限，將於星期日屆滿，執行以後預料恐怖份子之報復行動，將立時趨於積極。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦問題　分治計劃已成過去　將提請聯合國處理</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕「世界新聞」中東特派記者稱二巴勒斯坦分治計劃已成過去，巴勒斯坦之未來，顯然僅有由聯合國機稱處置之一途。在上週之英國阿拉伯代表會談中，貝文並未表示贊成分治，且曰分治不在委治國職權範圍以內，任何越出委治職權範圍以外之解決辦法，應請聯合國機構決定。貝文認爲莫理遜之聯邦計劃較合暹輯，惟以阿猶兩族均予堅決反對，亦碍難强迫施行。阿拉伯代表團仍堅持去年十月彼等可提之方案，即建立阿拉伯民主國佔居民三分一之猶太人可以享受全權，在內閣中可享受三分之一之代表權，貝文於上週之談話中，曾請阿拉伯代表再事讓步，然此項希望成爲事實之可能性殊少，故至最後巴勒斯坦問題當仍不得不向聯合國機構提出。</p>

<h3>希境調查團開會　我代表發表見解</h3>
<p>主張迅速完成責負使命</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典一日電〕聯合國事實調查委員會今晨十一時，在此問舉行會議，討論現行一般局勢，以及其履行職務所雷採取之方式，歷時頗久，至午後一時卅分，始告敵會。席間中國代表即該國駐比利時大使金間泗　士，發表演說，敦促調查委員會迅速進行其所負使命，路謂：吾人所當完成之工作，至爲難亘，世界與情，均集中視綫於本委員會云。調查委員會最後當一致同意，遷延時日，足以引起各方之批評與削减聯合國之勢力。該會並決定總反有關四國代表列席陳述意見定於本月三日開始，將由阿爾巴尼亞代表首先陳述其本國之觀點，繼之則將爲希臘代表。據希臘代表開勞通知調查委員會稱：渠將就邊界衝突提出兩項文件云。</p>
<h3>出席莫斯科會議　美代表團達百人　英蘇將商談軍事同盟</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓一日電〕美國務院頃宜佈：美國出席莫斯科四國外長會議代表團，將包括專家一百人，美政府已將美代表團人數通知蘇聯政府，此將爲美國在戰後出席國際會議最重要之代表團。此外報紙及廣播電台記者七十三人，曾要求國務院准其隨同代表團前往莫斯科採訪新聞，蘇聯政府現正就此事加以研究。衆信參院外委會主席即共和黨議員范登堡·及民主黨參議員康納利將隨同馬歇爾國務卿前往莫斯科，但官方對此則迄未發表聲明。又國務院顧問柯亨及蘇聯事務顧問波倫，亦有前往莫斯科之可能。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二日電〕「世界日報」外交記者本日聲稱：英外相貝文將於下月告知史達林，英國歡迎與蘇聯締結與現行英美協議相同之條約。世界日報披露此文，謂莫斯科外長會議開會時，貝文將與史達林秘密商談此事，並將探悉現行英蘇協定內史達林所反對之「弱點」。據稱，具文屆時將鄭重聲明，英蘇之間與英美之間皆不能締結在聯合國機構範圍外之條約云。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀草就　普遍裁軍案</h3>
<p>蘇聯代表持異議</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕擴權威方面消息：美國準備向安理會提出之世界普遍裁軍方案，己因蘇聯之反對而受阻。此項計劃係美代表奧斯汀與杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿磋商後所草成，將軍備與原子限制併爲一個方案，已預先向安理會其他十國代表秘密接洽。奧斯汀會晤蘇代表葛羅米柯時，葛氏即表反對，美國是否將讓步或堅持方案中全部主要條款，尚不可知。大的奧斯汀將與其他代表非正式協商後，再作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕美代表奧斯汀所擬之普遍裁軍方案，包括三點：（一）安理會應設立十一國裁軍委員會，提出種種建議。此一委會不討論原子彈或其他大規模破壤武器，原子武器將仍由目前之原子能委會處理之。（二）另設起草少組會議，制定特別條文，以供裁軍委會參考。（三）安理會下屆會議時，應開始考慮原子能委會之首次報告書。</p>
<p>設徵詢會</p>
<p>此外將由四強外長代表及關係國代表合組「情報及徵詢委員會」，該一委會將與外長會議平行工作，使所有其他盟國均得知曉和的準備工作之發展。例如於討論德國西部疆界問題之際，該委會應包括四强外長代表以及荷比盧森堡之代表，於討論東疆之際，波蘭及捷克當然應列爲關係國。在第二階段中年法國主張使各盟國均得參閱外長會議中與各該國特殊利益有關之各種文件，各盟國並得以觀察員之身份。列席四强外長代表會關於任何一點一之討論。</p>
<p>保持聯絡</p>
<p>同時四強外長代表，在第二階段內，亦得任命專家組織小組，其他盟國有參加此等小組者，一四強之專家代表完全處於平等地位。故當開始第三階段之際，所有盟國均已先期獲知四强初期討論之情形，是與前此巴黎和會討論五德國附庸國和約之情形，已大不相同。在第四階段中，「情報及徵詢委會」又將開始活動，以爲盟與四國強外長會議間之直接運絡。此間外交觀察家，相信法國之程序備忘錄，已糾正巴黎和會程序上之缺點，可望博得廣大的同情。</p>
<p>魯爾計劃</p>
<p>又悉法政府今日向英美蘇三國駐巴黎大使所提關於國際管制魯爾區工業之備忘錄，純屬經濟文件，具有管制德國主要工業之詳細計劃。</p>
<h3>草擬對德和約　法提程序問題</h3>
<p>分爲四階段進行</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕法國所提關於德國和約準備程序之備忘錄，提交外長會議秘書處後，將於下週二在四外長代表會中討論。茲悉備忘錄建議和的準備應分四個階段，即（一）三月間在莫斯科召開之四强外長會議；（二）外長代表會議根據莫斯科會議之討論結果，提出德國和的之第一次草案；（三）召開廿二個盟國之和平會議，討論該一草案；（四）再度召開四强會議完成最後和的。法備忘錄爲滿足其他盟國要求參加和的早期討論之志願起見，建議在莫斯科會議時，即應設立徵詢機構，四強外長得邀請任何盟國參加主要討論。</p>
<h3>美太平洋艦隊　將舉行海空大演習　美菲基地談判僵屍可打開</h3>
<p>〔聯合社桑狄哥二日電〕美國太平洋艦隊第一機動部隊司令蒙高萊今日宜布：自本月下旬起，該隊將在中太平洋舉行演習，直至月底止，各式艦船及飛機均將參。第一機動部隊係由第五艦隊改編而成，此次演習，將較去年十二月間第五艦隊在加州沿海舉行之演習規模更爲廣大，並有流動之供應與修理設備，參加海空演習。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕美陸軍部今稱：陸軍地面部隊總司令特孚斯，今出發往阿拉斯加，視督特種部隊在北極環境下試騐冬季配備。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺一日電〕美菲軍事基地協定，談判己逾六星期，自美國駐菲大使麥克納德突向菲律賓政府提出如欲美國撤兵，美軍即可全部撤退之議，今日又傳談判己將近完成。菲總統羅哈斯及外交部長奎里諾對美方提議立加拒絕，顯己打開因基地地點問題所釀成之僵局。羅哈斯本星期曾向議會報告稱：美國甚願撤退所有軍隊，但於同時慎重聲明美國自認有按照菲人願望保障菲律賓安全之基本義務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕美國陸軍部與海軍部今日宣稱：爲惟備「全球立體戰爭」，將以混合之訓練以統一陸海軍軍官之軍事思想。據稱，現有選定之海陸空軍軍官的九百人，在高級軍校共同學習。</p>
<h3>歐洲工業復興的障礙　煤斤缺乏是最大的致命傷</h3>
<p>本文原載於美首都華盛頓出版的「世界報告週刊」中，係採集最近自倫敦，巴黎，柏林，華盛頓及其他各地之調查報告撰成。本文之研究結果爲「目前展開之煤荒，阻梗了西歐工業的生產」。因爲缺乏煤斤鐵路，工廠，水電廠和家庭工業都進行緩遲，戰爭損失的復原都受了影響。</p>
<p>西歐的煤礦出產尚不及戰前產額三分之二。最重要的補充來漁就是美國。美國的煤產出口規定每月爲二百萬噸，但是往往因爲生產和航運的阻斷使出口煤量不能達到這個噸數。</p>
<p>去年春天美國的煤礦工人罷工使歐洲受到嚴重的影響。接着，夏天來到，解決了問題。而現在正是嚴寒的季節，西歐極須美國的煤產來推動機械和保持溫暖。目前美國煤礦的生產减低直接影響了歐洲工業的復興。</p>
<p>因爲輪船海員的罷工，去年九月和十月間美國的煤產輸人歐洲使抵預計的半數。自去年春季的罷工停止以後，歐洲的安全已經逐漸地有了保障。</p>
<p>美國煤產的出口對於西歐的重要可以從下面的統計裏表示出來：</p>
<p>（美國供給歐洲各國用煤佔其用煤全數的百分比）。</p>
<p>義大利　百分之七十</p>
<p>芬蘭　百分之六十</p>
<p>挪威　百分之四十五</p>
<p>葡萄牙　百分之四十二</p>
<p>瑞典　百分之三十二</p>
<p>丹麥　百分之三十二</p>
<p>瑞士　百分之二十五</p>
<p>荷蘭　百分之二十二</p>
<p>法國　百分之十三</p>
<p>比利時　百分之八</p>
<p>（根據一九四六年八月的數字）</p>
<p>去年八月裘，當美國煤產出口合乎規定的時候，歐洲各國仰給於美國的煤產總計是佔百分之廿一。</p>
<p>依賴美國最甚的是義大　，她從美國輸入煤量達其全部消耗量的百分之七十。所有在斯坎的那維亞半島上的幾個國家（挪威，瑞典等）都大量仰給於美國。法國和幾個低地國家（荷蘭，丹麥，比利時）當美國未發生罷工的時候，從美國輸入煤產比較自德國西部輸入的爲多。因爲美國礦產開採的延擱對於煤產輸入各國的效率也就引起了嚴重的影響。</p>
<p>美國出口煤產的重要足以影響美國本身生產。去年前十個月之中，美國輸入西歐的總量是一千五百萬噸，與美國一個星期階通的生產量相等。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>德國原先是西歐煤產的唯一的出口國。但是現在却也停止輸出到鄰近各國去。德國英軍佔領區內食物缺乏情形很是嚴重。最近數星期來，煤產的數量是急驟地减低。因此，幾個鋼鐵工廠關了門，電力廠的產品也减少了。</p>
<p>英國決定减少魯爾和萊因一帶的出口來支持工業的生產。這個提議的理由是英國打算自足自給。他們對於德國目前的內部政治糾繼也頗感困煩。</p>
<p>德國英軍區的煤產出口從去年十七月到今年五月將要减少去年九月九十三萬五千噸出口額的三分之一。</p>
<p>德國法軍區之內，包括薩爾河流域，每月出口十二萬五千噸，大部均供應法國本土之用。每一個礦工的產量，較英軍區爲高。其生產率也接近戰前的標準。</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>法國受魯爾區域困難的影響甚钜。德國西部的電工業生產减少影響到法國。目前德國工業的半數已經停滯狀態中。</p>
<p>直接影響到的是，德國的全部電力消費量至少减少百分之二十。</p>
<p>法國煤料的供應是在一種不穩定的情况下。法國的公用事業目前只有十七天的儲煤量。</p>
<p>法國的煤產，今年是五千萬噸，超過了一九三八年的標準。很多的戰犯，被雇用在煤礦裏工作。但是效率並不很高。因爲人數的衆多，尚足以瀰補效率不高的缺陷。可是生產額仍然遠不及法國本士的需要。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰之前，法國輸入了全部煤產消耗額的百分之二十八。其中的三分之一是從德國運輸過來的。在美國海員罷工之前，法國進口美國的煤料來補充供應，其數量達到每月七十萬噸之多。</p>
<p>因爲從德國輸入煤產已經中斷，因此法國十分急切地增加購買美國的煤料。因此美國運輸的停滯，就使法國戰後復員以及工廠和運輸的恢復受了嚴重的影饗。</p>
<p>義國</p>
<p>義大利消費的煤料大部都是仰給於他國的。義國的煤礦開採達到戰前百分之七十五的數字，但是仍舊只足抵消費額百分之十三。義國消費的煤料都是從美國輸入的，同時有一部份是用聯合國善後救濟總署的款　來購買的。</p>
<p>倘若美國煤產出口被阻中斷，義大利無疑要逍到崩潰了。波蘭也把小量的煤供給義大利。英國可能罄其所有的數量供給義大利，但是沒有美國的煤和購買煤料的款項，義大利要遭遇猛烈的經濟危機和政治混亂了。</p>
<p>比國</p>
<p>比利時可以從德國輸入小部份的煤料，倘若美國的煤產不能輸人的話，所受的影響截之西歐的其他國家要輕得多。</p>
<p>比利時消耗的煤產，在去年八月閱，約從美國輸入百分之八。從其他來源輸入的，主要是魯爾區域，是百分之五。</p>
<p>但是煤料的缺乏仍然對於比利時的工業有相當的影響。主要的是鋅鑛的開採，倘着沒有煤的燃燒，是只有停頓工作魄。</p>
<p>荷蘭</p>
<p>荷蘭倘着沒有美國的煤產供應，其工業將必嚴重地殘廢了。她每月煤斤全部消費量的百分之廿二，要從英國輸人。另有百分之十五是仰給於德國，但是這其中三分之一將要被阻斷了。荷蘭本國的煤礦開採只比戰前的半數略高一點。</p>
<p>荷籣的工業要從戰爭所蹂躪的廢墟中復興起來，勢必遭遇到長期困難的日子。目前最嚴重的問題也就是煤的缺乏。</p>
<p>斯堪的那維亞半島上的國家是不出產煤的。他們大多數從英國，德國西部，波蘭和美國獲得煤料。</p>
<p>較諸戰前，英國的出口是减退了。但是波蘭的出口是可能增加的。</p>
<p>德國西部和美國的煤產出口的减少，對於斯堪的那維亞幾個國家是很嚴重的，尤其是瑞典和丹麥的鋼鐵工業，將受到嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>波蘭</p>
<p>波蘭增加煤礦生產的進步很爲迅速。去年達到四千九百萬噸的記錄。即使將德國東部的西里西亞省的礦區也估計在內，仍然低於戰前的標準。</p>
<p>波蘭煤產的四分之三是被蘇聯攫去的，其餘的大部份輸往斯坎的那維亞半島。</p>
<p>在西歐極端缺乏煤料的現在，波蘭有一個最好的機會來控制西歐的市塲。但是因爲蘇聯生產恢復的綏慢，波蘭任何大規模的出口都不能達到歐洲西部去。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>英國戰前是世界首要的煤產出口國。輸出年達到五千五百萬噸，以今年的數字相比，是覺得膛乎其後了。</p>
<p>自從英國生產跌落，國內的消費昇高，煤礦的出口眞是寥寥得問憐了。英國缺乏煤的情况十分緊張，因此若干電工　　迫停頓，以保持煤的　量。所有的工業對於用煤的預算是必須縝密地計劃，謀的供應較一年前减少百分之十一。</p>
<p>整個的團的西歐，將因煤的缺乏而使生　　凖劇烈地低落。倘若美國的煤礦不能保持適當充足的數量來供應西　，那麽嚴重的情况將變成緊急的時期了。倘若能夠保持火車運　不受　陰，那麼工業生產就不必受到限制了。然而用以取應的　斤，却逐漸不容易得到了。（俞晶）</p>

<p>〔改造社東京二日電〕日政府當局針對二月一日後各工會所採策略，決定禁止各工會於二日以後分別實行軍獨罷工，內務省警保局長谷川一日談稱：預定於二月一日實行總罷工之各工會，倘於二日以後個別實行罷工，即視爲二月一日罷工之延續，違反麥帥命令，當依旣定方針加以取締，各工會今後如欲單獨罷工，須重新向當局提出要求，進行談判，談判失敗，則向中央勞動委員會提訴，再經一個月不獲解決，方可實行罷工。又全國公務員共同鬥爭委負會隨二月一日罷工之中止而解體後，所屬各工會一日舉行代表會議，決定設置聯絡會議，今日召開籌備會議結果，咸以總罷工旣爲麥帥命令所禁止，今後己不能以共同鬥爭方式實行罷工，談判倘不以罷工爲後盾，難期成功，聯絡會議等組織機關，在目前階段，己無存在之必要，且此類機關將束縛各工會之個別交涉，故聯絡會議亦決定於以撤銷，今後通過全國工會組織保持聯絡。去年十月以來，動員二百六十萬公務員，計劃歷史性大罷工之共鬥組織，遂正式宣告解體。</p>
<h3>製造原子彈發見　六種性新毒質　輻射綫能深入骨髓殺人易如反掌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕加州大學海密爾登博士，今日向美國物理學會報告，己發見六種新奮質，皆由原子分裂而來，係非氣號全金屬物質，爲科學界所知毒質中之毒性最烈者，故名之爲「可怕的半打」。銀分裂時可產生此六種毒質，其本身之毒，與原子分裂所產生者相等。鈾分裂時亦可產生此六種毒質，維　之本身不如其產物之毒。此六種新毒質均爲普通金　，但由原子分裂產生時，係同位原素，發出幅射綫可歷數月之久。此種金屬原子錯配之爲害，係因其本身及母質鎭沉　於骨之裏層，靠近骨髓。人類受幅射綫攻擎時，骨髓爲其最大弱點。幅射綫之殺滅骨髓，較殺滅其他組織爲速，毒贊在骨之裏層，即可達到骨髓，但與食物同吃時，並不進入血流，故不能達到骨而排洩出體，並不爲害。若用噴霧法呼吸入肺，或使創口與之接觸，即可達到骨，而使人致命，此六種毒質即銀，錯，　，及　之同位原素。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火調查委員會，曾於昨午赴新閘路振華油漆公司察看被消防員以利斧劈開之王家衣櫥，見樹門裏面破洞邊在指印纍纍，宛然可辨。當由警局督察處長張達電令警局將該項指紋拍攝照片，俾與消防員之指紋互相對證。張處長說：「這是最公正，也是最有把揮的。罪犯的頭顱，料想已難保全」。</p>
<p>調委會曾於昨日續訪證兵廿三團外事组憲兵宋志鵬，彼當日親自在塲，與美軍取得聯絡，曾目睹消防員不努力救火，而集於十五號洋房內取食橘子花生等。據彼稱：到達火塲時，大火已延燒至二十一號洋房，曾遇見十一號居戶唐姓者，當即告以火勢尚未延後，趁早搶救東西，常時曾協助其搬出女用自由車一輛。在十五號中看見許多消防員在談天，其中一個問我：「憲兵，我們可否喝杯開水？」他們便拿起地上的熟水瓶取飲，我說：「喝完了趕快去救」，即返身引退。當我第二次再進去時，看見一身材矮小，似隊長模據之消防警正欲取食橱中之食物，並問我：「橘子要吃嗎？」我說「不要」，但這人的號碼已記不淸，到翌日三時始離開火塲。</p>

<h3>律師界一盛會　四百辯士各逞詞鋒　陳霆銳姜屏藩等當選理監</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一向門前冷落車馬稀的黃陂南路律師公會，昨天下午忽然車水馬龍，幾乎全上海的律師都動員起來了，參加抗戰以來已經間斷了十年的會員大會。</p>
<p>在報紙上常常看到的名律師一個個出現在簽名簿上，握手，談話，滿塲洋溢着愉快的笑聲，女律師也有二十餘位。陳霆銳感慨地脫：「二十六年開了一次會員大會，接着盧溝橋七七事變，轉眼十年過去了，今天是抗戰以來律師界第一次盛會啊」！沈鈞僑老先生搖幌着壽星的腦袋說：「我進了律師公會大門，宛如出嫁的女兒回到娘家。」江一平進來，逐一的握手，名律師氣派，畢竟不凡。　黃陂南路律師公會的會址是會員自己出費建築的。抗閘中曾租與大同大學作校舍，勝利後收回，但裏面四壁蕭然，開會用的椅子是從寗波同鄉會借用的。</p>
<p>全滬律師數達千餘　該會現有會員一千零七十四人，昨日出席者的四百餘人（按照規定，出席三分之一已足法定人數）。</p>
<p>下午二時起開會，陳霆銳主席報告；「憲法已經公布了，中國走上法治的道路，因此，我們當律師的責任比以前更加重大。如何推進憲法？如何促成法治？如何改良司法？均爲吾人今後之課題。我們要互相勉勵，互相督促，以求完成此時代的使命。」繼由社會局代表陳肅致詞，陳霆銳再報告會務後，接着討論上海市律師公會章程草案，至此，各會員發揮激辯，舌劍唇槍，咬文嚼字，一切的看家本領都拿出來了。</p>
<p>第一個爭論的問題，是會費一萬元與五千元之爭；原案訂會員應按朋納經常費一萬元，瞿誠認爲太多，主張五千元。江一平駁他：「現在坐一次三輪車起碼也要兩三千元，一萬元實在不算多。」瞿誠又反駁：「我們現在吃一頓飯要好幾萬，是不是會費也應該定幾萬呢？」雙方爭論還未解決，半路中又殺出程咬金，覺得一萬元還少，主張每月二萬元。表決結果，仍維持原案。</p>
<p>收取公費根據指數　另一個爭論的問題，是原草案第七章第二十七條「酬金」，爲全體會員的利益所在，大家都聚精會神的討論。薄鑄，周宏基均認爲原案所定的數額太低，江一平提議將「酬金」改爲「公費」，表決結果，改爲「會員受當事人之委託，辦理訴訟案件，得收公費，其數額依民國二十六年生活指數爲標準比例增加之。」</p>
<p>集四百餘名辯士於一堂，你一言，我一句，大家搶着台下的「麥克風」，合上的主席則極力控制住會塲的秩序。窗外，在幕已慢慢地垂下來了，三樓會堂中沒有電燈，臨時懸上了一盞大汽油燈。</p>
<p>改選理監事的結果，計選出理事二十一位，監事七位，下面是一張名單，我再略加分析一下他們所隷屬的系統：</p>
<p>新任理監當選名單　理事：陳　銳，江一平，災紀梅，鄭麟同，湯覺先，俞恩良（以上東吳系），沈鈞儒，張且平，張致果，馮嵩，居簡生（法學院系）；單瀛輝，吳象賢，韓學意，張光宗，王善祥（法政學院系），王劍鐸，周餛，陳化鵬，尹勇（持志學院系）；俞鍾駱（浙江法專系）。監事姜屏藩，許之森（東吳系）；錢錚，王培基（法學院系）；吳變華（法政學院系）；黃濟元（持志學院系）；徐佐良（浙江法專系）。</p>
<p>散會時已經暮色蒼茫，萬家燈火。大家一擁而出，輕鬆地踏上歸途，心裏還忘記不了一句：「十年來的律師界第一次盛會啊！」</p>

<h3>影院懷舊汞</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>每天，有三十萬人在全市數十家電影院中擁進擁出。電影在上海市民的娛樂生活中，已佔得了最重要的位置，然而上海設置電影院，正式峽演電影，却不過在二十世紀第一個十年內的事情。</p>
<p>電影的前身——幻燈片，在淸光緒十一年的十月裏，曾由顏永京氏在格致畜院峽演過，內容大槪是些「世界集錦」之類，因爲是業餘性質，並沒有發生了怎樣大的影響。</p>
<p>光緒二十九年（一九〇三），有一個西班牙人雷瑪斯（A.　Ramos），帶了一架半舊的電影放映機，和幾卷殘舊的片子來到上海，在福州路昇平茶樓放映，每夭　了些印度人在門口大吹大擋，門票每人三十文。數年後，雷氏把獲得的利潤，在海寗路乍浦路建了座鉛皮影戲院，（即今虹口大戲院），第一次開映的片子名「龍巢」（The　DragonNest），繼又在海寗路北四川路口建立「維多利亞影戲院」，裝璜陳設，比較華麗。此爲上海有正式電影院之始。</p>
<p>由於雷氏經營的成功，有葡籍俄人郝思倍（S.　G.　Hertzberg）在宣統二年創設「愛普廬影戲院」於北四川路，與維多利亞力事競爭。另有西人林發（A.　runiahn日）就海寗路北江西路口的鳴盛梨園改組爲「愛倫影戲院」，（後改名「新愛倫」，一二八戰事後廢。）虬江路的中華大戲院也由粵商曾煥堂改設爲「上海大戲院」，營業都很發達。雷瑪斯爲了在營業上競爭起見，竭力在本市設立電影院，現在大華工人戲院的原址，即雷氏經營的夏令配克影戲院，在當時很出過風頭。此外雷氏又先後建恩派亞，卡德，萬國於南，中，東各區，雷氏的經理古藤倍（B.　Goldenberg）又在梧州路設立中國影戲院，在方浜橋設立共和影戲院，雷氏勢力益形雄厚，因此現在還有人稱雷瑪斯爲「上海影院大王」。</p>
<p>民國十二年，天津的「中國影戲院公司」來滬創設「卡爾登大戲院」，當時它的規模，在上海已是獨步，是年二月九日以名片「盧宮秘史」啓幕，票價高達二，比起那時花八九個銅元就好去看一看的小影戲院，自然是了不起。開幕後得觀衆一致讚譽，稱爲「上海第一影戲院」。</p>
<p>繼卡爾登而起的是北四川路的「奧油安大戲院」，爲永泰和烟草公司總理陳伯昭獨資建造，佈置華麗，足與卡爾登相頡頏。陳氏又經營「奧迪安電影公司」，辦理電影配給事務，美國派拉蒙出品的影片都歸其經理，聲勢大振，繼又在東區建立「百老匯大戲院」，在中區建立「新光太戲院」。二十一年，奧迪安燬於淞滬事變，同時因爲南京，大光明，國泰，大上海等一流電影院已先後建立，新光已不能稱雄，百老匯更不足道，奧迪安電影公司的黃金時代，乃成過眼烟雲。</p>
<h3>國片之宮</h3>
<p>中國的電影製片業，比電影院業落後了約莫十年光景。因此最初期的電影院，都只放峽些西片，實在說起來，在維多利亞和愛普區走紅時候，電影院中的觀衆，十分之九是外國人，國人往觀者還極少。民國初年，當中國製片業正在開始興盛起來的時候，製片多在上海進行，但國人自製的影片，却無自營的大電影院，不得不仰仗雷瑪斯系的影戲院，當時的夏令配克影戲院，確一時成爲國產片首輪公映的場所。</p>
<p>但是中國的製片公司在上海出映片子的利益，處處受雷瑪斯的操縱，不免感受影響。製片界羣謀挽救之策，起初擬聯合各有力的製片公司，承包租雷氏各電影院，卒以租價不合，未成事實。民國十四年，明星影片公司提議自辦電影院，與百代公司會商，收買北海路雲南路口申江共舞台，改建爲中央大戲院，從此明星有了它自己的戲院，作品的出路自然不成問題，其餘製片公司如上海，百合，國光，長城，神州，中華等所有出品，大都薈萃於中央。彼此都曾受過外界托辣斯壟斷的痛苦，所以中央取夏令配克而代之爲「國片之宮」，製片業才有大轉機。中央大戲院的開幕宣言上也說：『上海影戲院也不少，再添有何必要？有，有，上海的影戲院太不替中國人打算，我們不願意給外人操縱電影太過，所以認爲確有添設之必要。』</p>
<p>這「國片之宮」在民國十四五年間，確實宣楊過它的使命，更由於五卅慘案的發生，市民對外片的興趣也陡形冷淡，國產片產量增加，甚有起色。十五年三月，雷瑪斯挾其二十年來在上海經營電影事業的盈餘，滿載返國。明星公司等立起招股，承租夏令配克，維多利亞，恩派亞，萬國，卡德等五院，同時組織「中央影戲公司」，除夏令配克轉租於愛普廬主人郝恩倍外，餘均自行管理，維多利亞經改名爲「新中央」，下久又吸收中華平安二電影院。以「提倡國產電影」標榜，以原設的中央大戲院爲領銜戲院。</p>
<p>不幸的是，國產影片並沒有力求進取，神怪片·武俠片和胡鬧片充斥影壇，粗製濫造，斷喪了它自己的前途。十五年七月下旬，中央影片公司開始用歐美片子加人放映。且因所屬各電影院的建築，不能與新建影院相比，地位日跌，峽片輸决亦低落。國產片的首輪權，從「中央」移到了「新光」，又從「新光」移到了「金城」。民國二十五年，中央影戲公司停止營業，所轄戲院，都分別出租，計其成立至　業，先後適爲十年。</p>
<h3>故都春夢·大受歡迎</h3>
<p>話題仍轉到民國十五年，那時期有一家嶄露頭角的戲院，即北京路的北京大戲院，創辦的是怡怡公司，它是以頭等的設備，放峽二三輪的西片，又因始創加映中文字幕，使不懂劇情的中國人易於了解，營業甚發達。民國十九年刷新後，放映聯華影業公司第一次出品「故都春夢」，大受觀衆歡迎，此後聯華出品在滬第一輪映權，十之八九歸北京，直至金城大戲院落成後，始消失此項專權。民國二十三年重建，改名「麗都」，隸聯怡公司，仍映西片。</p>
<p>當北京展幕的前不久，林森路上也設立了一家東華影戲院，就是現在的巴黎。决年租與孔雀電影公司，改名「孔雀東華」，十九年主人再次改易，院名方改爲「巴黎」。</p>
<p>在北京東華之後，建造於蘇州河畔的光陸大戲院以第一流電影院姿態出現，開幕片爲「採花浪蝶」（Ivan　Mosjukine　in　“Casanova”）。起初專映歐片，營業不利，十八年由遠東遊藝公司接辦，裝置有聲映片機，專峽派拉蒙有聲對白片，生意之佳，爲光陸全盛時代。隨後轉租予英人經營，自國泰，大光明等相繼建立後，光陸營萊，陡受打學，加以聯合影片公司重價收購派拉蒙上乘影片，光陸益形不支，終告破產。後由蘭心大戲院所收羅，重行開幕，以映歐洲片爲主體，自蘭心輟演電影後，光陸乃專映二輪美片。</p>
<h3>大光明舊址　卡爾登舞塲</h3>
<p>民國十七年到廿一年間，電影院的成長有着可驚的速度，次等影院如東海，蓬萊，山西，光華，明星，西海，等先後建立不計外，規模偉大，設備究善的第一流影院如南京，大光明，國泰，大上海等也在是時建成。（右圖大光明大戲院）</p>
<p>大光明舊址爲卡爾登舞塲，十七年冬造成，爲中美合資組織。當時地位還不足與卡爾登抗衡。十九年由南怡怡公司經營的南京大戲院在愛多亞路上建成，始壓倒卡爾登，奧迪安，和當時坐每一把交椅的光陸分庭抗禮。它的魏築採用「雷納桑」古式，塲內設備，冬煖夏凉。開幕時，美國紐約日報稱它爲「美國的洛克賽（Roxy）」。二十一年元且，霞飛路邁爾西愛路角的國泰大戲院以瑙瑪希拉「靈肉之門」啓幕，佈置堂皇，專峽米高梅名作，於是第一流影院又增加了一座。</p>
<p>這裘要提到一個加入英國籍的「敝國」人，名時盧根的，向在中國各地經營影院，和經理外國影片公司的出品。二十一年，他和中外鉅商發起組織聯合電影公司，計劃收買全市一流電影院，第一步就把靜安寺路上的大光明大戲院拆去重建，投資一百十萬兩，全部建築採用現代立體式，內部設噴水泉三座，設備上又有冷氣間，RCA有聲電影放映機等，當次年夏以「熱血雄心」開幕時，全市爲之風處。盧根雄心勃勃，他以大光明爲聯合公司的主將，除了建築設備力求完善外，又把座價壓低，使別的頭輪戲院不能招架，首先受其影響的，是光陸被逼關了門。而國泰，，卡爾登以及巴黎，融光，上海，明珠，華德等中小戲院也歸入了聯合公司旗幟之下。</p>
<p>和聯合公司足以對峙的，是聯怡公司，（前身即南怡怡公司，再前稱怡怡公司。）除北京大戲院及南京大戲院爲其轄下外，二十三年又接管了大上海大戲院。大上海原爲融融公司創辦，在當時聲勢着實煊赫。北京改建麗都後，專消納南京，大上海所映各片的二輸映演權。</p>
<p>話說盧根的托辣斯好夢做得並沒有多久，只因把所有股金，悉數投賣於電影院的不動產，而經營時　轉不　，積欠甚鉅，終被債權人控訴，弄得聯合公司幾乎瓦解，幸而措置得宜，風潮沒有擴大，於是放棄了許多小戲院，單　動國泰與大光明，改稱「國光公司」。直到民國廿七年的六月裏，因鋻於電影院有組織合陣綫的必要，和南京，大上海，麗都等合併成「亞洲影院公司」。</p>
<p>孤島時代的上海，因爲電影商業的發達，新設立約有靜安寺路卡德路的大華大戲院，和戈登路的美琪大戲院。此外在愛多亞路上的滬光，福照路上的金都，也以首輸織產片的地位與金城，新光相競爭。</p>
<p>至於現有電影院，　　心杜　等都算入，已有十七家放峽言輪電影。其中美琪·大光明·鑰寨·南京四院放映　納·羅斯·派拉　·及哥倫比亞出品，大華專峽米高梅出品，大上海專峽實電華作品，金門巴黎映華納米高梅，運光新光有時映環球作品，蘭心有時映演英國片，杜美多數量蘇聯片。國產片除在金城。新光等院映演外，由平劇院改裝的皇后大戲院，也經常開映國產新片。因爲國片產量不多，幾乎都是美國片的天下。現有電影院的名稱，請翻閱本報第十二版。話已說得太多，恕我不再　　了。</p>
<h3>一段插曲　美英日僑大開打</h3>
<p>上海最早的電影院—虹口大戲院開辦時，所映的片子都是些日俄戰爭的新闻片。看客以英美僑民居多，都坐在前排看，後排都是些日本人。那些英美僑民看到片中日本人滑稽的動作，不禁拍手在笑起來，坐在後排的日人惱羞成怒，雙方起了爭執，把木製的椅檔拆下來作交戰武器，打得頭破血流，戲院中落花流水收塲。</p>
<p>上圖爲皇后大戲院</p>
<p>右圖大華大戲院，其前身爲夏令配克</p>
<h3>九點一刻俱樂部</h3>
<p>九點一刻正是晚塲電影放映的時間。九點一刻俱樂部」也是一個放映電影的塲所，那裏沒有日塲，祗在晚上放映，所以名之爲「九點一刻俱樂部」。</p>
<p>這是一個影迷所組織的一個秘密團體。當上海淪爲孤島的時候，日寇對租界所施的壓力，一天一天地加强。許多有刺激性的美國影片不能在戲院中放映。於是有許多英美的影迷，組織團號，專映外面所看不到的影片。這時日寇尚未進駐租界，所以這秘密團體遠能立足。</p>
<p>「九點一刻俱樂部」在南京路外灘沙遜大厦八樓，那處有可容二百觀衆的命塲。規定每星期放演二次，映了許多很新的片子，像卓別靈的大獨裁者，早就在那裏演過了。這俱樂部維持了兩年之久，至太平洋戰事發生後，　無形解散。</p>
<p>美琪大戲院</p>
<p>以航空爲題材國產片鐵島係戰前聯華影片公司出品</p>
<h3>第一部有聲電影</h3>
<p>在一般觀衆看厭了黑白片，而爭看五彩片的現在，提起了從前只許看不能聽的默片時代，想想眞不禁亞然失笑。小時候坐在露天影戲塲裹，看着銀幕上的「荒江女俠」嘴巴一張一闔，却渾不知道「主角」在說些什麽，那一種瞪目結舌，心癢難熬的樣兒，心裏總怪不舒服。科學進展驚人，曾幾何時，銀幕上己變了如此「有聲有色」，報上的電影廣告已發現了「幻麗原子十彩」的字樣。不久，除「有聲有色」以外，還加上「有者有味」也說不定。</p>
<p>廿一年前，美國紐約市一個酷熱的黃昏，全世界第一部成功的有聲電影—華納公司的「Don　Juan」公開獻映！音樂伴奏着畫面的演出，（但竟　不見音樂隊在什麼地方！）銀幕上的Don　Juan竟會開口演講！從此，沉默了好久的銀幕，永不再是啞口無言的了！</p>
<p>而有聲電影傳到中國，上海的電影院開始映演有聲片，又隔了五年之久！</p>
<p>第一家裝置福托風有聲設備的上海電影院，是一九二九年的影院權威夏令配克。第一部與上海觀衆相見約有聲片是「飛行將軍」（Captain　Swagger）。靠了「獨家映演有聲片」的廣告，夏令配克在上海稱雄了半年。不久大光明·光陸·卡爾登·奧迪安等都裝置有聲設備，再後除了「巴黎」曾一度「鷄立鶴羣」，專映默片外，中小影院也一律添裝有聲機了。</p>
<p>實在，在夏令配克放映有聲片以前，上海已有過二次片邊發音有聲影片的試映了。一次在民國十五年的十二月，一次在十七年的十一月。</p>
<p>十五年冬，上海百星大戲院從美國裝來時福萊（De　Forest）有聲短片數種，在院裏公映了六天，其內容多爲音乘舞曲，及短劇。公映時，美國技師對於片邊發音原理，盡力解釋。</p>
<p>敎育年　的西幹事　　　簿士在十七年十一月回來，帶了一副特　萊有　電影　，在是月十一日　　通常試片，關映的片子也多數是音樂歌舞短片。壓軸戲是「長島旅行記」，內容精采，有本報記者之紀錄爲體：</p>
<p>『火車由遠而近，　　輪聲亦　之而起。到了長島，長島的鄉邨風光一一映入；童子軋牛乳聲·　聲·鴨聲·牛鳴聲·犬吠聲·運有一個小孩子被窗外的一　花狗呌醒了，揉着眼購哭。啊，僞太妙了』！</p>
<h3>譯意風</h3>
<p>踏進峽演西片電影院，大多數觀衆聽不懂銀幕上的英語對白，不免引爲憾事。爲了這，電影商也想盡腦筋，如何來彌補此項缺憾，解決的辦法：是裝置「譯意風」。</p>
<p>現在一般規模較大的電影院，都有了譯意風的設備，每一個座位後裝置了撲落，只消租用那具「無錢電耳機」式的譯意風，套在兩耳上，再將綫頭插入撲落，便和影院中一切聲息隔絕，聽担任說明的小姐吐着流利淸脆的國語，翻譯着銀幕上的對白。這樣，不懂英語的觀衆，也能完全了解劇情以及劇中人的言語，這辦法自然比加映華文字幕高明得多了。</p>
<p>最初應用譯意風的影院是大光明，在民國二十八年十一月開始裝　，此項設備還是由美國的製造廠家爲大光明特製的，租用代價，每具一角，確甚便宜。十一月四日，大光明柬邀中西各報記者，試峽「奇俠歸來」片，首次應用譯意風，成續異常圓滿，博得一致好評。</p>
<p>担任譯意風說明的小姐們，多數是敎會學校的女學生，英語根抵很好，翻譯正確，口齒流利。當銀幕上女在角開始歌唱的時候，效會告訴你取下譯意風來，於是你的耳朵又換了一個世界，欣賞着悠揚曼妙的歌聲了。</p>
<p>租用譯意風適宜於情節複雜對白冗長的影片，「錦繡天堂」「夜夜春宵」等的歌舞片根本不需用譯意風，就是情節比較簡單的劇本，你不懂英語，也寗可去體會，因爲戴了譯意風，銀幕上的配奏音樂及其他應該「聽」的地方倒不能欣賞了。至於租了譯意風去看「幻想曲」，那更糟糕！</p>
<h3>卅五年度影壇小拾</h3>
<p>去年度的影境，有着這樣幾個特色：</p>
<p>五彩片大量輸人；</p>
<p>大腿歌舞片如「出水芙蓉」之類鍛受觀衆歡迎；</p>
<p>以二次大戰爲背最，用「間謀」，「反侵略」等爲題材的影片特別多；</p>
<p>西片充斥影壇，國片寥落無幾；</p>
<p>黃牛黨大肆活躍。</p>
<p>傳記片中，「幽默大師」「左拉傳」「國族之光」「居禮夫人」挺不錯。值得大書特書的，是卡通大師華德狄斯耐給我們不少好作品：「小飛象」，「鐵翼長征」，「小鹿班比」，「南海幻遊」，和「幻想曲」等。</p>
<p>西片中，美國片佔到百分之九五·一强，英國片僅佔千分之四，其除是蘇聯影片。</p>
<p>國產片中，多數以「抗戰」做題材。美片中，也有不少片子如「中華萬歲」之類把「中國抗盛」用來做題材，只可惜有點兒「隔靴搔癢」，並且導演時也許忽略了中國的實際情形，却一味地捧自己，因此在許多片子中，電找不到一張好的。</p>
<p>「危險性的曲綫」，「春色無邊」，「拚命向女人進攻」，「殺搏猛烈」，「空中飛人」，「立體轟炸」，「納粹大亨色迷迷，春閏少婦嬌滴滴」，「危險塲面更多更狠」，「照眼生春撩人欲醉」……</p>
<p>猗歟盛哉！猗歟盛哉！</p>

<h3>美國各業代表　反對减低關稅</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕美國各項工業之代表人對於當局减低某種商品，或原料之進口稅率，曾發表言論，表示反對。彼等曾提供多數意見，以備將來由國務院主持貿易協定談判時作爲參考。反對减稅者唯恐政府官員將利用前國會所授與之權力，准許現行之多種稅率减低百分之五十。造紙商，織物商，化學原料公司代裏人，光學用玻璃及玻璃沙製造商，以及其各種工業之發言人，曾親自向國務院官員提供意見。按進口貨販賣商及應用進口原料之廠商等曾提出减稅建議。此項减稅建議在美國國會中之結果如何，經濟學者大都不敢加以猜測，但美國國會中共和黨員佔據多數爲十年以來之創見。目前之减稅權力乃民主黨在國會中以多數票決授與總統者。</p>

<h3>台糖公司積極　恢復戰前產糖量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：台灣糖業公司刻正積極修復台灣之糖廠及鐵路，以便恢復戰前之產糖量。修復鐵道所需器材，業已向美國定妥。本年六七月間，可望全部運到。預期十一月前，即可全部修復供用。據悉：鐵道未修復前，產蔗區之甘蔗，無法運至各地糖廠製糖。且甘蔗係二年一熟。太平洋戰爭時，蔗田受損慘重，生產奇缺。故自勝利後，迄去年春之產糖量，的僅八萬噸。去年冬迄今春之產糖量，約僅三萬噸。茲者以肥料問題，業已解決。甘蔗之產量，可望逐步增加。預計本年十一月間，鐵道修復後，對其蔗運輸量，可增加至三百萬噸，則今冬至明春一階段間之產糖量，可望增加至三十萬噸。此後如甘蔗增產順利，計劃進行盡如理想，則公司每年之產糖量，可望達到五十萬噸之目標。據可靠估計：目前我國全年消耗食糖之數量，的爲十萬噸至二十萬噸。將來如交通復原，則消耗量將遞增至三十萬噸。故以台糠產量而言實足供全國耗用而有餘。目前該公司在台灣之存糖量，經常維持在十二萬噸左右。每月對合灣省七百餘萬人口，須負担配糖量的二千噸。該公司在滬之存糖，亦經常維持在五萬噸左右。滬公司自去年五月間成立迄今，已配出食糖約五萬噸。滬公司每逢週四配糖一决。去年共計配售二十九期，本年亦已配售四期。第一期配售四八三五〇包，第二期九〇五〇包，第三期二七二〇〇包，第四期三一一五〇包云。</p>

<h3>粗鹽向日本易貨　並不致影響食用</h3>
<p>中信負責人發表之意見</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕化工界巨　李燭　氏，於上月二十一日電請中央，反對以大量粗鹽向日本易貨，其意謂日太民食及農牧漁礦用鹽，一向皆能自給，此番要求供給粗鹽，純爲製鹼之用，如予大量供給，則無異培植整個日本之化學工業，記者特以此事向中央信託局方面探詢，據該局某負責人稱，李氏之意見雖不無理由，然謂供給粗鹽，爲培植整個日本之化學工業，則屬過慮，對於此事，吾人應注意二點，第一我國以粗鹽向日本易貨，純係以過剩之鹽類，向日本易取急需之品，故供給日本食鹽，決不致影響我國之民食與工業，且易貨之舉，必須斟酌緩急，權衡輕重，組鹽在我國爲剩餘之品，交通器材與工礦器材爲急需之品，以此易彼，不能不謂爲計之得者也，第二，日本現由四强管制，一切自有統籌，如四强確欲日本培植之工業，則供給粗鹽，亦爲整個計劃之一部份，不能謂爲不當，如四强不欲培植日本工業，則此項粗鹽亦不致轉趨於發展日本工業之用途，故吾人所宜注意者，爲日本管制問題，對於中日易貨之貨品數量，可不必斤斤計較也。</p>

<h3>士氣不振小將敗挫　猶太昨大勝龍傑　五比一猶太佬大施報復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕甲組足球聯賽，昨日午後二時半，龍傑再戰猶太於逸圓球塲，球迷四千餘人。相當熱烈，交戰結果，猶太以五此一勝龍傑，上半時猶太以二比零佔先。</p>
<p>猶太復分連發連中</p>
<p>龍傑先攻，金綠生首謝被麥尼蒂倒身抱住，脫離險境。番帥有德華與左右兩異默契，攻入龍傑腹地，趙永芳擋住去路，周永久逃出一刻鐘之久。十八分鐘時，麥律希得球傳中，愛德華順水推舟，直入龍傑門首，脚頭稍差，被門傳左，却畢司基冷路飛起一腳，遂建一功，一比〇猶太首開紀錄。龍傑痛失一城，合力反攻，奈猶太防務極嚴，不爲所乘·廿八分鐘時，愛德華再入，依樣葫蘆，却學司基趕來一脚，梅開二度，二比〇龍傑又失一城。至此龍傑陣勢搖動，腹地任憑番兵縱横蹂躪，上半時結束，猶太以二比〇佔先。</p>

<h3>悼綱球藝人許承基</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>日前病逝英京的網球名手許承基，是我國運動員揚威海外的第一人。許君係荷屬市印度爪哇烏華僑，今年僅三十四歲，自幼嗜習網球，技己楚楚可觀，曾奪得全爪哇網球冠軍。民國二十二年國慶日，第五屆全國運動大會在首都舉行，許君代表巴達維亞華僑回國參加網球賽，該隊雖於複賽中爲上海隊擊敗，但許君一嗚驚人，保持個人不敗的戰績，尤以戰勝宿將邱飛海一役，深受觀衆稱賞，當時許君祗二十歲。</p>
<p>首次參加台維斯杯</p>
<p>南歸以後許君努力不懈，球事進境迅速，因與鄭兆佳同時中選爲一九三五年度我國出席台維斯盃網球賽代表，不意初戰即遇强敵美國，美方主將爲曾獲惠勃爾登世界網球單打冠軍之勃琪（按：勃琪早經轉入職業網球界。）許君乍逢大敵，仍能發揮精湛的球藝，比數爲：四—六，一—六，八—六，二—六，許君雖敗猶榮。</p>
<p>其後，許君技術突飛猛進，曾執上海單打冠軍數載的美人卡遜，置决敗辱我國手，許君數度挫之，爲國人爭回榮譽。二十四年，六屆全國運動會在上海舉行，許君仍代表爪哇區出席，得全國網球單打冠軍，復與乃弟承位合作雙打，獲得亞軍（按：冠軍爲林寳華·邱飛海組。），成爲我第一名國手。</p>
<p>我國參加一九三六年度台維斯杯網球賽，仍由許君與鄭兆佳君出席，抽籤結果，首遇歐洲帶中之覇王法國，不幸敗績。</p>
<p>一九三七年的台杯網球賽，我國代表爲許君及蔡惠全，首遇紐西蘭隊，許君力勝兩單打，因蔡君的軟弱，卒以二比三遭淘汰，但國際間的評論，認爲中國代表球藝己竿頭日上，此次係「光榮的失敗。」許君更被指列爲世界第一流選手。</p>
<p>惠勃爾登綱球大會</p>
<p>同年，許君首次參加惠勃爾登世界網球大會，被選爲種子選手，單打連捷三週，達到最後三十二人的階段，晋至第四週，以四盤劇鬥，敗於美國名手梅谷。許君又與瑞典選手薛洛特合作雙打，戰績亦不弱。此外，許君復在歐洲各國，參加各種錦標賽，在十二個比賽中，奪得九决冠軍，迭决擊敗英義第一流國手奧斯汀·史蒂芬尼·休士等，法國名宿勃魯尼翁，也被許君兩度以直落三擊敗。許君曾參加英國伯明罕敎寺綱球賽，連得冠軍三年，遂得永遠享有錦標。</p>
<p>英商鄧祿普橡膠公司爲世界有名廠商，除車胎出品馳譽國際以外，所製綱球，暢銷海外，該公司當事人，鋻於許君藝名廣播，便邀請許君作週遊世界的壯舉，借此宣傳。我國運動員得此殊榮寵者，以許君爲第一人。</p>
<p>中英聯姻傳爲佳話</p>
<p>民國二十九年一月二十六日，許君與英國網球健將琴·包爾馥小姐在倫敦結婚，中英網球明屋聯烟，一時傳爲佳話。包爾馥小姐的父親，曾任錫蘭島的法官。</p>
<p>戰事爆發之初，許君供職巴達維亞英商鄧祿普橡膠公司，日人侵入以後，遂遭監禁，疏於練習，去年被派担任我國台杯選手，以四比一淘汰丹麥於初賽之中，許君爲我隊主將。决賽遇比利時，許君雖力取兩單打，因同伴蔡惠全的軟弱，結果以二比三遭失敗。去年度的意勃爾登網球賽，許君曾晋達第三週，始遭淘汰。</p>
<p>據網球專家意見，一致認許君爲世界第一流選手，惟因體力所限，故不能造成更完滿的戰績。</p>
<p>勞苦功高體育大使</p>
<p>許君正當少年有爲，國人無不寄予深切的期望，噩耗傳來，令人不勝震悼！</p>
<p>去年，許君曾在倫敦向聯合社記者發表談話，說明我國網球界的缺點。是缺少新進人材，他說：「我們最大的需要是新設備，多年以來，上海並無眞正的草地網球塲，我們甚至不得不用舊球廢拍作球賽」。這一句遺言，至少，我國體育當局負責人，應該牢記！</p>
<p>許君是離開我們了，但是他替中國掙得來的光榮，是每一個同胞所永遠不會忘懷的。我們要用最有意義的舉動，來紀念這一位勞苦功高的「體育大使」，不是眼淚，用不着也花圈，我們應該設法造就，產生第二個許承基！</p>

<h3>老虎頭　雪中探</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者丁匡華</p>
<p>南京一月卅一日快訊</p>
<p>周逆佛海，預簽「十年以後眞知我」，「並作簽呈」</p>
<p>羅逆君强，自命爲「發言人」，侈談「政治休息」</p>
<p>常周逆佛海判處死刑的那一天，記者在他還押老虎橋監獄之際，曾爬上囚車，探訪過周逆，他那時巳喟然說：「我的死，在戴雨農將軍死的那一天，已經註定了，今天大成殿上的判定，不過是公開宣佈而巳，當然沒有什麽希罕。」在他懷着「命運註定殆不知我」的心情下，幷簽題「十年以後眞知我」七字，此亦可謂人之將死，其當也「哀」吧！</p>
<h3>病中一紙簽呈　哀訴王道不離人情</h3>
<p>一個天氣淸朗陽光將落的下午，踏着融雪後的泥濘道路，走進了老虎橋高院看守所，取出卡片，接見萬所長，說明訪問周逆佛海的來意。經萬所長請示了趙院長，概然允諾。當記者步入看守所後，那時，監獄醫官溫鳳年正在診治周逆的病，用着一支一百CC的針管在注射專治心臟哀弱針劑。經過半小時之久，藥水始全部射進肌肉內。據溫醫師告記者稱：周命難以保全，隨時有死的可能，平常人的呼吸，却有二十六次至三十二决，且脈最多已經達到一百三十二次，最少至九十八决之多，朝夕有「停擺」之處。現在的針劑，不過是維持現况而已。病勢旣然如此嚴重，自不能接見交談，反由那狹小的長方形孔洞，窺見了他曲着腿蜷臥在被內，顯得非常的悽凉。</p>
<p>有一個監獄官在旁告訴記者：在昨日上午周逆尚用西式信箋，親書簽呈一紙，內謂：「竊本人已經最高法院維持死刑原判，執行當在朝夕，個人生死，本早置之度外，但對於家屬不能不有所慰藉。王道不外乎人情，懇乞對於本人家屬接見，勿限定日期及决數，至感德便」，下面簽着「周佛海」三字，是由本人親自特呈的。經記者打聽這張懇乞「王這不外乎人情」的東西，尚安放在所長的辦公桌玻璃版下，雖沒有正式允諾，但總給他方便多了。所以這幾天，伊妻楊淑　當然是接二連三的去接見他。昨日下午二時許，伊妻偕同伊女　海又前往接見，詎知周竟大發牢騷。「你們來幹什麼？更有什麽可談的，趕快替我回去，一切我自己知道，不用你們多管！」伊妻聞斥，號啕大哭不休。　海在旁，亦苦淚流出眼眶。周逆速說：「哭又有什麽用？我是不在乎死的，你們快去吧！」說到這裏，「周逆雖然鎮靜，然亦不免兒女情長，流下兩行淚了。」陳所官也告訴記者在剛押進時候，他的脾氣放肆之極，誰也壓不住他，近來却安寗得多。</p>
<h3>羅君強自爲發言人　花生米招待記者</h3>
<p>周逆旣然是病入膏肓了，訪問也沒得用，記者還這而來，難道就讓它一無所獲嗎？那麼，訪問其次丁逆默邨羅逆君强自然爲要訪問的目標了。記者站立四號門前，周佛海舖在右側，羅君強舖在左側，了默邨舖正迎着門。丁逆發言時，均發出一聲「哈哈」的奸笑。羅君强以小丑的姿態表白道：「你們想見周佛海，我可以代表，你們有什麼要問的，問我好了。我過去是周先生的秘書長，現往還是秘書長。我們同在一起，有一年多，要談的甚麼，我們都談完了，而且我可以保證的，沒有一點秘密。我就是四號的發言人，句句忠實，決不騙人。」他見記者未及發問，先說了個開頭語：「我們在此處整夭的除了聊天，就是看書，周先生大都是看外國雜誌一類。」羅逆又說：坐牢是「愉快」的一件事，用了數十年的「政治腦筋」，此時有一個機會「休息」，也是好的。不過精神上顯得「難過」而已。說到這裏，他還從舖旁，拿起了一隻太平春的四方茶鐵罐，倒出一堆靑島花生米給記者說：「今天是我很簡陋的執行，下次來，照樣執行你。」他自己很得意的笑着，他更告訴記者：「每日有妻子來送飯，生活倒不爲苦。記者藉此取笑曰：「夫妻本是同林鳥，大難臨頭各自飛。」那麼，你的妻子倒很不錯：「那就是「大難臨頭在一增」了」。他笑了，記者又追說了一句：「在一堆這三個字不大盡善吧！」他通忙加添了「精神」兩個字。</p>
<h3>丁默邨覺得無話可講　「已失賭博資本」</h3>
<p>丁迪這時走來，帶來「悔悟」的語氣說着：「我實在是失去賭博資本的一個角色，現在又有什麼話好說？」</p>
<p>最後，羅逆題了兩首詩：「落紅不是無情物，化作春泥更獲花，」「絕業名山幸早成，更何方法遺今生？」在周逆睡臥的牆頭信插內，記者發現了一串一百零八粒的佛珠，即問：「周佛海是不是念佛？」羅逆說：「是太太送來的。」同時，信插內還有一本「彼羅密般若心經」，談的時間不算短，足足約有三刻鐘，走出看守所，馬路兩旁的電燈，早己亮了，寒風還在瑟瑟地吹來。</p>

<h3>紫陽之邦</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者俞寗頗</p>
<p>婺源十八日訊</p>
<p>番踞徽饒三百里，平分吳楚兩源頭；</p>
<p>白雲有脚乾坤合，遠水無波日月浮。</p>
<p>明汪循詠鄣山詩</p>
<p>上面這首詩句：是表示鄣山的高峻和偉大，雄跨吳楚兩朝。不僅是作皖南外　的屏障，而且蘊吐出了許多的特產以及紫陽文物之書香。</p>
<p>大槪婺源這縣名，許多人是很少熟識的，記者今不妨把這裘的山水，人物，特產，交通，等情形，作一個詳明的介紹：</p>
<p>婺源，是處在皖南贛北的邊陲，是宋理學大師朱晦庵，已故鐵路工程大師詹天佑（字春誠）的故鄉。以前是屬安徽省舊徽州府所管轄。民二十三年爲便利剿匪，歸劃贛轄的。四周崇山峻嶺，無論縣城和鄉鎭村落，都被靑的山緊緊擁抱着。蘇杭一帶多水鄉，這裏適成一反比，山多於水，很充分地表現着仁壽之徵。居民多服田貿遷爲業，鄉村房屋，大半是磚築的多，富麗古雅。每一村莊，襯着綠水靑山的圍繞，風景至爲幽蓓。但是每一村落，又少不了和農人共處，農家和商家及士紳住屋，有似三合土凑集而成。所以不缺少和其他地方一樣地有着美的和醜的成份。</p>
<p>叢山交通　陸多於水</p>
<p>婺源位置在鄱陽樂江的上游，又爲錢培，新安江的發源處，都是邑北浙嶺的瀑布，岐着南北兩面的分流。所以該山又叫做浙源山，即浙水發源於此的史證。</p>
<p>全境只有東北兩大河流，一發源於東鄉譚公嶺，經江灣，汪口，詞坑，至武口，計長六十五華里，一發源於北鄉浙源山和大都山，經施村，虻關，鳳山，羅紋，清華，龍騰，思口，至武口，計長一百華里，由武口匯合東北兩水經縣城，太白，新村，入德興，計長又百餘華里。爲婺源直達樂江，鄱陽，航綫交通的要道。兩河通舟揖，北河由縣治達淸華，東河由縣城達江灣，西南兩郎多屬一葦可跨的澗溪。</p>
<p>四境水陸交通，北連皖之休寗·祁門，東鄰浙之開化·常山，南昆贛之德興·樂平，西接浮梁·景德鎮，除德樂一路可通航行，其餘各綫，都屬旱道。境內通衢道路，全爲完整靑石舖築，寛坦異常。名敎育家黃炎培先生，曩曾履經斯地，譽爲道路工程的偉大，國內實所罕見。</p>
<p>民十八年以後，本縣鄰境修竣之公路，有　景。（據）婺華·（浙省華埠）婺摔·（興）婺屯·（溪）四綫，抗戰時因軍事上關係，都被拆除·民二十二年因贛境內地商貨，多由河口·屯溪轉接運輪，又　關了河·休·手車運一錢，由河口經此間直達屯溪，但此綫開　後，迄未行駛車輛，現在是蓬蒿沒徑，沙石　途，己成為泥滑難行的捷徑了。</p>
<p>朱子讀書處：白鹿洞</p>
<p>蚺城：天香亭　（實頗攝）</p>
<h3>佳山麗水　畫意不盡</h3>
<p>婺源無處無青山。這句話的確是切合婺源所處地位的身份。桂林山水甲天下，這裏的山水，似別逼肖。蜀中山繁挺健，形險嵯峨，這裏的山，崇高不逮，柔麗過之，在有嵐峯擁翠，畫意不盡。而且青山處處，綠水環流，仁智之樂，足供欣賞。春之日排松適青，山花艷發：夏之日堂開綠野，署　生涼，秋之日碧溪紅樹，好放扁舟，多之日蠟象銀蛇，寒江獨釣，四時之景不同，而樂意亦是無窮盡的。</p>
<p>上面四時的景色，猶是此間普遍之風勝，特出最著的景色，還有高湖山雲舖海，在鄣山的瞰鄱湖，靈巖洞的奇景仙跡，楓水覃的紹社的台，洞賓廟的仙牛望月，朱故里的虹幷祥雲，浙源山的玉帶瀑布，溪頭溪的繡水秋波，長灘村的龍溪閣，洪源村箭頭崖，芙蓉峯的對鏡，石峽高池，夭香亭的賞雪，石耳觀雲，嚴源九曲，百里花橋，這都是婺源的風景綫，或以人傳，或以幽著，或是山形狀物，或是秀拔出神，含奇蘊勝，各有天造地設的優美。</p>
<p>時事新報青光，載驅人遊廣西，帶來的。都是佳山麗水，令人神馳。果使王濟遠先生履游此間，記者必料它所携去的，當不亞於粵西所獲的　稔。</p>
<h3>特產三珍：茶·魚·硯</h3>
<p>產物稱之曰珍，當然和同質的物產有分別，今寫在下面，以見它所眞珍字的優點。</p>
<p>鄣山雲霧茶</p>
<p>茶名雲霧，名貴可知。距縣城約七十里的邑北集和鄉附近，有一座偉大的高山，叫做大鄣山，周圍縣百數十里，界跨浮梁，休　，婺源，三縣，廣　　翠，高與雲齊。山頂平原和依山坡的地方，都植了茶樹，每年產量很巨，爲山農年恃收益的大宗。山間出產的茶葉，與別處的茶葉迥異，葉面是純綠色，背面的帶淡黃，一葉顯分兩個顏色，每葉遍露如透明紗眼的小孔，但都不穿通。飲時用開水沖泡，茶法是久久不出的，顏色雖然清不見綠，質味却特甘郁香醇。取鄣茶一葉，與取他處茶一撮沖泡比較，味能以少許勝多許。以視浙之龍井，閩之武彝，有過無不及。　山茶最珍貴的，要數八卦峯懸崖峭壁間的雲霧茶，因山峯如廬山的經年不見眞面，常被雲霧所籠罩，茶業飽受露霧淸新的空氣，故葉身厚白，徵現銀毫，味苦澀而深有幽香。用開水冲泡孟內，蓋覆少頃，揭開時，隨有白氣一道上冲，繞繚如雲，茶名雲霧，由是而稱。這茶生產甚稀，僅於懸崖腰隙間，靑靑的長育數警，山人採擷茶葉，如婆羅洲人的採燕窩相似，用長繩繋木椅，以兩人扯由繩端，人坐椅上，由崖頂徐徐放下，抵茶處，　枝採摘，盡產擷焙，不過得茶斤許，用縝密裝，饋贈嘉友，物稀爲珍，彌足可貴。</p>
<p>龍溪桃花魚</p>
<p>魚號桃花，可和雪裏紅的菜名，同樣的引人生愛。這魚產於此間北鄉龍　河流中，魚長不盈寸，首碩而身圓，因它腹底有紅紋數點，彷彿似桃花，故名。每值春初杏放，夭桃含蕊未開的時候，魚羣團集於淺水沙石間，逐波散孵，以它身的渺小，　看之，不見所在。漁人到此時結草網，依沙拖撈，終日捕取，至多得魚數兩，隨用溫火焙乾，盛諸錫器，經過若千時日，等它羅熱退去回軟，取食浸入少許醬油，味奇鮮美，功能消食開胃。</p>
<p>桃花魚產地有爾處，一是北鄉龍騰，一是東鄉汪口，爾村都屬俞姓，惟龍產優於汪口，最奇的是，此魚的捕取期，至多旬日，過此就無所獲。因此魚在桃花含蕊時，目肓多團集，至花放，則睛光不羣，見人逸散矣。</p>
<p>武溪龍尾硯</p>
<p>硯是一種礦石黃帝以玉爲硯海，是爲世所共知的。硯材並不祗一種，有水晶硯，鐵硯，銅硯，磁硯，竹硯，等種種名稱，我國各硯材中，以肇慶的端石，徽州的歙石，號州的澄泥，最爲適用。自此以後，端歙澄三硯石，遂盛行於世，尤以歙硯的龍尾石爲最晞珍。</p>
<p>世人只知歙硯是產於徽州的歙縣，但不知產目婺源東鄉武溪能尾山，耦耕居士新安竹枝詞云：「硯名以歙歙無之，能尾山源在武溪，山本屬整州統歙，硯仍名歙：「名迷。」看這首詞句中，足以證實硯的產源所在。蘇東坡龍尾硯歌云：「黃琮白琥天不惜，顧恐貪夫死懷璧，君看龍尾豈硯材。玉聽金聲寓於石。與天作石未幾時，與人作硯初不辭。詩成鮑謝石何與，筆落鍾王硯不知，錦菌玉匣俱沉垢，搗練支牀亦何有，况　蘇子鳳珠銘，戲語相嘲作牛後，碧天照水風吹雲，明窗大几淸無塵，我生天地亦閒物，蘇子亦是支離人，組言細語都不擇，春蚓秋蛇隨意畫，願從蘇子老東坡，仁者不用生分別。」蘇老的歌，又是證明歙硯的珍責。　婺源產硯的坑，有十四，（一）龍尾山，（二）羅紋山，（三）眉子坑，（四）金星坑，（五）碧裏坑，（六）水舷坑，（七）水蕨坑，（八）溪頭坑，（九）葉九坑，（十）盧坑，（十一）濟源坑，（十二）靈巖坑，（十三）麻石，（十四）棗心，硯石有三品，（一）龍尾，（二）羅紋，（三）眉子，這三種硯的石質。大抵都堅勁瑩潤發墨，以有金星而斑顯鮮明，燦如泥金的爲貴。最上的其形如龍尾，謂之龍尾金星。散佈如花草落滿者次之。凡有金星的硯石帶綠色，除金星外，其他或紋似蘆花，或如織羅樣，或如眉毛，或爲刷絲，紋俱白色，隱隱如銀，以上能硯，都是潤嫩潔膩，能貯水不耗，發墨如油無聲，停墨浮斃，護毫增秀，用久鋒芒不鈍，識者莫不珍視。</p>
<p>龍硯開於南唐，塞於北宋，據古老相傳：開坑取硯時，縣令將溪流改道，盡吸其水取之，所賽多屬上品·令其鄉人迷風永，復將溪水導回原路，水深不可復得。迄後年湮代遠，礦苗已矣所在·民二十二年五省預備軍剿匪總司令陳調元駐節婺源。聽知本地產硯，會找尋該村年紀最老的人士，研詢硯源，並出現金二千元，令往窮源探採，結果一無所獲。</p>
<p>曠世所稀的文明寳藏，久任它長理地下，不爲世用，　令人有和　理光之感！</p>

<h3>現代淘金記　專機在港失事　黃金滿佈山頭</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>香港一月廿六日航訊</p>
<p>這一個月來，航空的「災星」出現於世界各大飛機站的上空，當這顆「災星」在地球上巡廻的時候，有好幾回掠過香港的軌路外；上海站出事於前，菲律賓站出事於後，香港人滿以爲「幸運」當頭，也許能夠逃過大刧，不料「災星」再三照臨，香港航空站終不免列入世界受災地點之一：一架載有價值一干五百萬美元黃金的專機，廿五日從菲律賓開來香港，當駛至只隔一個高山，便可看見啓德機塲的時候，雲霧遮閉了視綫，便向山頭撞去，於是金元隨天飛，飛機起火，機員殞命，「災星」帶着稱心的微笑，離開了香港。</p>
<p>在全球陷入「航空災」的今天，又一架飛機失事，常然加深刺激人類的神經，而剛巧這架飛機，數的不是乘客，却是計重兩噸半而分載五十餘箱的纍桑黃白物，在人命草芥的社會裏，似乎倍覺震撼心絃。那四個機員之死，眞算得「以身殉金」了！</p>
<p>那是一架C四七式運輸機，在來港前，已一度失事於菲律賓北部，幸得安全降落。然而那些黃金，好像招天之妬，特派「災星」追隨牠，總要「得之」然後快心，所以，當牠駛近最後的目標，也難逃出刧運。廿五日那天的氣候，上午晴明，天開氣淸，適逢正月初四，港中遊人如織，甚是熱鬧，不料到了下午，天外吹來陣陣陰雲，氣壓頓低，不多時，山頭堆積雲霧，灑下絲絲細雨，正在這個時候，「災星」出現於香港上空，菲律賓航空公司那架運金專機，剛好飛抵香港東部筲箕灣附近，「災星」作法，烟霧迷濛，機師視綫失明，說得暹那時快，（下午三時零二分）專機直向拔海一千七百三十四英尺的山頭撞去！專機碰撞之點，離山峯僅五十英尺，假如當時飛行稍高，此番不幸，也許可能避免吧。</p>
<p>專機失事後，當晚因氣候惡劣，無從發現落在何方。及至廿六日上午九時許，始被發現，於是警察大員和銀行大亨紛紛駕車趕往失事地點去。專機載黃金價值一千五百萬美元，計值港幣六千萬元之巨。但一說謂祗值法幣二千萬元。據調查所知，係上海匯　銀行，比利時銀行，大通銀行，運通銀行，東亞銀行，鹽業銀行及交通銀行所有，此外還有一部分屬於少數商人者。經警察嚴密搜查，已拾回黃金三分之二。據稱有一部分金元，已隨飛機爆炸時飄散天外，有一部分金條則爲烈火所熔化。繼續搜尋結果，也許續有發現。讀者閱讀至此，試閉目幻想，一個山頭滿佈金元，若干人聚精會神在旁發掘，若干人手持短槍在旁監視，若干人憂心忡忡在計算搜尋結果，而在有生命者之外，則有半具飛機殘骸，四個燒成黑　的不幸「殉金」者，那是一個何等的景象象！那是「金」而不是「人」，爲什麽要國惡劣天氣，「不屈不撓」趕來香港「送命」？那個解釋，便揭開了這個社會不合理現象的一角！同日，由港飛渝的中航機又告失事，但那裏載的是「人」，而不是「金」，所以，一般人對牠的反響便似乎淡簿了許多！</p>

<h3>星期論壇　我所知道的西沙羣島</h3>
<p>— 黃强</p>
<p>邇來報章所載，中法兩國當局，因西沙羣島主權問題，發生爭執，在我國自日人手中收回後，法國兵艦復派兵登陸，事體不算不離奇，不嚴重。筆者於民國十年，民國十七十八兩年，及民國廿五廿六兩年，三次服務於瓊崖，對於該羣島情形，頗知梗槪，概述於后，以告國人：</p>
<p>（一）西沙羣島的歷史及日人經營經過　該羣島爲我國極南之領主，誌書史冊，均有記載，向爲海南島漁民捕魚之所烏上有孤魂廟一座，即係彼輩所築，年代久遠，已不可考。民國十年問，台灣專賣局長池田氏等，利用何瑞年，以西沙羣島實業公司名義，瞞請政府，乘辦西沙羣島墾殖採礦漁業各項，飭由崖縣發給承墾證書，同時併案請領昌江港外浮水洲，開辦漁墾，而實際上經營者，則爲日本人所組織之南興實業公司，因招各方反對，至十七年春間，始行撤銷原案。時筆者適任廣東南區善後公署參謀長，以案經撤銷，亟須繼續經營，隨於五月間呈准省府派遺海瑞艦進行調查，並縣備一切業務，除由善後公署派遺按師數人外，並由粵建設廳派出技正，中山大學派出敎授等共廿餘人，前往該羣島從事調查設計。事後據彼等調查所得，在林鳥有日人遺落日記簿一册，知民國八年，即有台灣人及琉球人死於島中，該公司曾於十四年七月十四日綴花環弔　之，而明記其事，可見日人之經營西沙羣烏，前後凡歷九年也。又在該島中除上述海南漁人所築高的六尺之孤魂廟一所外，尚有日人經營之建築物，計林島西南隅有管理人辦事室住室一所，廣六十三尺，深十八尺。辦事室後方有食料及雜物儲戲室一所，廣六十六尺，深二十四尺。辦事室左旁有小賣店一所，廣二十四尺，深十二尺。小賣店之左有工人宿舍二所，離立成曲尺形，長各九十尺，寛十五尺。宿舍之前，有工人食堂一所，長四十八尺，寛十五尺。小賣店之前。有炊　室一所，長三十尺，深十八尺。附近有廚房一所，長二十叫尺，深十二尺。旁有水井一座，井旁安置抽水器，並有巨大之水管，管與辦事室後之畜水池及前之抽水機相通者。蓄水池大小四座，爲儲藏雨水之川，小池用舊鐵板造成，的四五方尺，大池由三合土製成，長闊各十二英尺，高六尺，天雨時，各屋瓦而之水，盡注池內。蒸水機則裝置於海濱，機後有鐵工室一所，寛廿四尺，深十二尺。各建築物之上蓋及牆，均以鋅片爲之，亦間有以木板或樹枝者。此外在儲藏室左側有養鷄塲一所，迤右有倉庫一所，長二百二十八尺，寛四十八尺，其中尚存島糞的千五百噸，又距數十丈外之林中，存有機油數罐。島中除廠舍外，尚有輕便鐵路長的五里，沿東南海岸分數支以入林中，幹綫則經倉庫以達碼頭之鐵橋，鐵橋之畏，凡一千二百五十餘尺，寛十尺，高約十七八尺，橋面橫木，俱用美國紅松，共六百二十九條。至其留存島上之物品，有電船兩艘，大小駁艇各兩艘。存於儲藏室及工人宿舍中者，有鋤頭數　　十把，竹箕百餘担，大目鐵節數十具，運搬車數十台，大籐　數十個，笠帽數十頂，草鞋百餘對，士敏土約百包，炭化　燃料數罐，其鐵匠用具及廚房用器，大致尚好。查日人之經營林島，可謂苦心慘淡，種種設置，至爲周備，若辦事室儲藏室宿舍食堂倉庫鐵道貨棧橋樑木船電船以及運送用之台車籘籮，採掘用之鋤畚網篩，無不齊全。有蓄水池蒸溜機井泉，以供給飲料，有食物貯藏室豚舍鷄栖撈魚船蔬菜圃以供食用，有小賣店以供給日常用品，有醫師以調理疾病，故能安全作業數年，捆載而去。</p>
<p>（二）島上產物之價值吾國領土在熱帶者，只此區區十餘里。查烏糞化石須在熱帶始獲產生，故西沙羣島之憐酸礦，謂爲吾國領土內僅有之產物，實無不可，吾國以農立國，得此天然肥料，爲益正屬不少。又珊瑚礁石，均可作灰，運銷內地，建築培田，爲用至廣，而海產豐富，聚集一隅，當大有經營之價值也。</p>
<p>（三）十七年以後之情况自經此次調查後，乃訂立經營　礦捕魚各種計畫，並有儘先設置氣象台與燈塔兩事之決定。嗣以廣東政變，中央固無法過問，粵省又無暇顧此，因而廢置。民國廿五年統一西南後，法國政府因日本在東北華北各處，蠶食日烈，有恐南太平洋爲日人侵佔之慮，乃藉口安南歷史「大南統一志」內載某朝皇帝，曾派人至黃沙島立嗣捕魚等語，要求我國將該羣島屬彼所有，我國政府，常然依理拒絕。至二十八年中日正在鏖戰之際，法乃派兵佔領，迨歐戰發生，法國戰敗，日又取而代之。夫黃沙島，是否即西沙羣島，固不必論，而寥寥數字，何能即認爲安南領土？日人之承辦該凝島之採礦墾植漁業等項，不向越南當局請領，而向我國政府請領，允爲國際上屬於我國領土之鐵證。又日人承辦之前與撒銷之後，未聞法政府發一言，直至廿五年，始向我政府提議，推其初意，或因如上所述南太平洋安全問題，明知我國不能保守，因彼之佔領，可使日本投鼠忌器，杜其妄取也。何期歐戰發生，彼亦不能保，終爲日人取去，今日吾人在日人手中收回自己原有之土地，眞是天經地義，法人無端爭奪，，實爲吾人夢想所不到</p>
<p>（四）西沙羣島與我國國防我國復興海軍，當然須以海南島之榆林港，爲軍港之一。而西沙羣島，實爲榆林之屏障，亦可謂海軍之前哨，萬一太平洋有事時，且可爲潛航艇之根據地。面羣島東端海面，更爲中日菲三國與南洋各地輪船往之來之要綫。</p>
<p>（五）西沙羣島位置與地形　西沙羣島，位於赤道北緯十五度四十六分至十七度五分，東經一百一十度十四分至一百十二度之四十五分，距海南榆林港東南約一百四十五里，爲盞國最南之領土，北起北砂島，南至南極鳥，東界林康島，西接七洲洋，統計大小島嶼礁灘二十餘座，星羅海面，約二百餘方里，乃一羣珊瑚礁結成之低島，西人統名之曰Paracesl。其迤東一帶，西人名之曰Amphitrite，迤西一帶名之曰Chroissant，各島多成環狀，或隋圓形，其大者的數十方里，其小者則不及十分之一方里。林島面積，爲一·五〇〇，一〇〇方公尺，石島較小，其面積六八，七五〇方公尺，登近烏面積，爲四三二，五〇〇方公尺，羣島面積亦小小，爲七六，二五〇方公尺，名島高出海面以石島爲最，高約有十五公尺，其他不過數公尺而已，各島上面，皆爲珊瑚及他種動物之遺跡，邊際較高，中間低　如普通珊瑚礁內盆也，而登近島中，尙有一小湖焉，七爲爲曾經勘查各島听得之情形也，</p>
<p>（六）西沙羣島之地質與土壤　丁沙羣島，爲珊瑚蟲窠及其他動物遺　所構成。昔日海面較高，珊瑚在水結成環形之礁，及海面低落，礁乃露出海面，珊瑚離水死去，遂成今日各島之形狀。而其他各種軟體動物，如頭足類腹足類瓣腮類等，又如賴皮動物之海　類海百合類等，以及甲殼類之殼魚類之首，均爲構成各島也質之一，島上除堅硬之珊瑚遺該及各種甲殼外，祗有烏糞及糞化石堆積其間，表面作灰色，內作稷色，此即所謂燐酸礦也，烏中土壤，俱由珊瑚及介殼類風化而成，故多爲細砂質土及礫質砂土，驟視之似石英，其實爲珊瑚及介穀之碎屑風化之物，其中含石灰量甚多，並富於鹽分，如堂烏東部小湖中之水，及南部椰樹下井水，均帶鹹味，又爲林島之波羅椰子，其甜味亦少，均爲土質含有鹽分之證明。林島爲　島棲息之總匯，土中含島糞最多，就大槪而論，各島林木業生，經歷年載，其根莖枝葉，腐朽而成爲腐植物質者，所在皆是。故谷島土壤，除海邊荒坦聚積白砂外，林地及草地之間，其土皆褐黑色，鬆軟異常，且極爲肥美。</p>
<p>（七）西沙羣島之氣候與海流西沙羣烏位置，正當熱帶之中，氣候炎熱，寒暑表最低時，在七十度以上，大率爲海洋氣候，一歲之中，無嚴寒酷暑，惟午問日光直射，熟度較高，終年時見驟雨，多南風，一日之問，午前六時與午後二時，溫度相差，常十餘度，年中最低溫期之一月，平均在華氏七十五度以上，最高溫期之夏季，平均在八九十度之間，冬季氣壓高而風強烈，夏秋氣壓低而風緩和，此就林島觀測言之，餘則未甚詳密，然亦可知其大槪矣。南海沿岸各處之海流，每因洋海之深淺，氣壓之變化，風向之差異，不能一律，即其發生之時率亦頗不同，西沙羣島之海流允無規則，常因風向而變，由十月至四月底，因東北風而生之西南水流，較之由五月至十月間因西南風而生之東北水流爲大而有常，水流之急，以十二月及一月爲最，其速度爲一海里至一海里半，羣島中間之水流，又與東西兩側不同，東側林島及石烏附近，常有由西至西北之水流，其速度的二海里，亦有由東而來極緩之水流，西側甘泉島及金銀島附近，亦常有西或西北之水流，而東北水流，亦間有之，其複雜如此者，蓋因位置關係，風向無定，　生此不規則之現象焉。</p>
<p>（八）西沙羣島之交通與物產西沙羣烏，還在南海中，其林康島迤東一帶，爲香港南洋羣島間航行之要衛，其金銀島迤西一帶，爲安南香港間交通之孔道，亦爲往來歐亞兩洲航綫之所經，其地位頗爲重要，且可爲吾國遠洋漁業之根據地。相因島無居民，礁石棋布，旣無港灣以停泊船隻，又無高山以屏蔽風浪，近岸處暗礁開繞，近則太淺，遠則太深，欲求一適當錨而位不可得，島面甚低，從遠處極難瞭望，風向無定，水流多變，有時有颶風，在無浮標燈塔，及氣象台無綫電台等之設備之情况下，當春期濛霧，或天候惡劣時，航經該烏附近，至爲艱險，四望海天無際，但見少數來自三亞榆林之漁船，寂寞徘徊於羣島之間而已。計由樹島至海口，約二百四十里，由樹島至林島，約九里，由林島至林康島，的二十四里，由林島至登近烏，的四十里，由登近島至金銀島，的十三里，由金銀島至榆林島，的一百四十五里。各島物產甚多，茲分類述之：</p>
<p>（一）動物　西沙羣島以產烏糞著稱，是等島糞，槪由　烏科之一種白腹鏗烏所排泄，白腹鰹烏多生長於熱帶鳥嶼，成羣棲飛。其卵較雞蛋略小，有斑褐色，雛烏羽純白，成烏羽灰黑色，腹部白色，嘴綠足紅，其肉味劣，不供食用，林島及小林烏棲息極盛，金銀島中亦多見之，此外則有海燕一種，爲數甚少。　類中惟林島多鼠，爬蟲類有蜥蝎一種，林烏當島皆有之，昆蟲類如蝶蛾等亦多，惟毒蛇惡蝎蚊蟲蟻蠅等，則絕無之。</p>
<p>（二）植物　谷島植物種類不多，大槪爲海南島之三亞榆林一帶所通有者，喬木有三亞樹一種，高三數丈，林島　島均甚茂盛，灌木則屬於大戟科桑科者皆有之，亦有相思子，雜草中有生齒類者一種，禾本科者一種，馬齒莧科者二種，林島及掌島有椰樹數株，珊瑚島有棕樹三株，皆高十丈左右，足爲島之標識，其餘各島之植物生長情形，大略相同，惟南極沙島爲尚礦。</p>
<p>（三）礦物　西沙羣島旣由珊瑚所構成，故除砂石及海島糞外，並無其他礦產。烏糞與糞化石積成之磷酸礦，其色狀有二，鈿如粉末者作機色，凝結成塊者內作稷色，外作灰色，其分佈狀況，在林島則成一層覆於表面，平均厚度爲二五生的米突，每塊重約數斤至數十斤，鮮有極大塊者，其下爲白砂，此種島　層，以要林島爲最多，石島次之，其餘登近島，掌島，金銀島，珊瑚島，林門島，樹島等，離亦有少量存在，但無開採價值，林島島養儲量按照測量結果，島糞與化石，所占面積爲一二九，一六〇〇平方米突，因礦質平均厚度爲二五生的米突，故其體積爲三二二，九〇〇立方米突。在此體積之中，植物之根所占體積，約爲十分之一，故煒酸礦體積實爲二九〇，六一〇立方米突，又以島上規有之裝礦手車容量計之，每車體積爲。〇六五立方米突，裝礦重半噸，如此則全島礦量爲二二三·五五〇噸，其已爲日人倫採之處，約占面積二八〇，〇〇〇平方米突，以同一方法計之，的被採礦量四八，五〇〇噸，則島上礦量，除已採者外，尚存有一七五，〇五〇噸，此林島一島之現在儲量也。燐酸礦用途，以作培田料爲主，蓋其中之燐淡鉀等質，均爲農田所需，若用新法化騐，將內含憐質，分別配裝，其利尤大。日人招工開採時，每名每日採島糞一噸，給銀二元，及運赴大阪，經溶解配合後，每担值銀二十餘元，可以知其利益矣。茲將日本大阪製肥所所發表甲乙兩種肥料配合成分抄錄如下，以供參考，（一）甲種溶解配合法之百分中之主要成分：室素全量，六·〇〇，亞摩尼亞，四·〇〇，燐酸全置，八·三〇，水溶性燐酸，五·五〇。（二）乙種溶解配合法之百分中之主要成分：　素全量，三·〇〇，亞摩尼亞，二·六〇，憐酸全量，一五·〇〇，水溶性憐酸，一一·〇〇，加里全量，一·〇〇。</p>
<p>（四）水產　各島之週圍淺海中，有海藻，海菜，海草，海棉，海參，海贈，珊瑚，蝶螺，蚌粭，墨魚，菓蟹，海龜，玳　，魚，蝦，石斑貝類等，由海南來漁者，多捉　拾蚌，所獲甚夥，　大者徑三四尺，重逾百斤，蚌類極美，其閉殻，盤長約二三寸，漁人乾晒之，視同瑤柱也。魚及海參墨魚，出產亦多，漁人不能就地乾製，不便運輸，但少取之以供日常食用而日。海南漁船，每船可容漁夫二十餘人，年中來往凡二次，春初來者夏初歸，秋末來者冬末歸，春來多捉龜，秋來多拾蚌，海龜玳　蚌蛤，各島均有，海參則登近島爲獨多。</p>
<p>西沙羣島漁業憐礦之豐富，及國防上之重要性，已如上述，所望我國朝野，急謀開發，與設防，否則門戶之側，有此龐然棄物，眞居室者之恥也。</p>

<h3>成品的檢查</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>在十一月十六日的本欄中已經談過工業應標準化，我想諸位讀者一定已　到了。但是標準底維持是什麽？即檢査也。現在筆者略加解釋於下：</p>
<p>設立各種標準並不見得十分繁難，，但要使這些標準完全實現，卻是十分困難，因爲事實上絕對的精確，是差不多辦不到的。進一步說，即使工具極乎精緻，工人極乎小心，極乎精巧，大小及形式和標準絕對相符的複本，也難以製出。所以在實用上，理論的標準，必代以實用的標準，所謂實用的標準，就是表明出品可以和理論標準差異到什麼程度，而仍舊可以十分完美。理論的標準可以容許的差異，隨工作底性質而異。大槪粗的工作，在性質工手及精治的工夫方面所能差異底範圍可以略大一些。而精細的工作，如果用的卡平槍之類在部分交換可能性方面，所需的完全程度是十分重要的，那麼其各部分底尺寸所能差異的範圍，就非極小不可，而且除非工作十分小心，也不容易得到完美的成績。最近美國製造卡平槍及其他軍用品的工廠，所得到的經騐，就可以說明道個原則。</p>
<p>所謂檢査，就是將各種材料出品及動作和所立的標準互相比較的一種按術。所以如沒有精確的標準，就完全沒有完善的檢査，在實行檢查的時候各種檢査的東西，有的是超出已經寬大的差異限量之外，有的是正在差異限量之中，有的是極近於所定的標準。檢査就是一種技術想在這三種的出品中，檢出那最適宜於手邊的工作的一種。所以假使標準底差異限度，略小一些，檢査底工作就要非常精細纔行。此外，我們還要注意檢査並不常常是純粹的機械式的工作，同時還需要檢査員底很好的判斷力。誠然，就一般的生產工業而論，實在是沒有一種像檢査底工作那樣需要銳利的判斷力和對於工作的深邃學識的，道種情形尤以差異限度極小的工作如精確出品底大量生產等，更爲顯明。</p>
<p>有時工作的標準不能精確地寫在越上，因之不能不借助於貨樣。因爲出品底色彩及完工以後的潤色工夫，凡不能用筆下寫出來的，都可以用貨樣來表明。又在化學工廠裏，我們到可以時常得到百分之一百純凈的出品，幷可以和標準的說明想付。所以工作標準和理論標準底相似問題，實在是隨工業及工作底性質而異。從事檢査的人員，如對於這些限制沒有淸晰的觀念，是一定不會有完美的檢査的。</p>
<p>檢査材料底必要條件可以根據下例任何一個或幾個的特徵：</p>
<p>（一）數量的，就是關於材料底數量或件數。（二）品質的；就是關於材料底物質上或化學上的特質。（三）尺度的；就是關於材料底形式，及完工以後的情形。（四）銷售的；就是關於材料是否適合其原來目的的問題。　就大槪情形而論。專由一個部分或一組人員祖負所有檢査底工作，這總是不大方便，而且也不大妥當，所以大多數的工廠總是將他們分成三個分立的部分，雖各部分底工作有時可以互相重疊。大概原料是由存貨主任管轄的存貨部檢査；尺度及其他製造方法是由總監工轄上的工塲檢查員檢査；而完成的製品則可以由其他人員祖任最後的檢査。在工程工廠及其他應用科學方法的製造廠裏，則最後的檢査和動作的測騐，大槪是由工程部或設計部担任。</p>
<h3>大家來做推銷員</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本年度的重要工作之一，可以說是推銷問題。因爲牠與增產計劃有密切的關係。按照學理來說，要制定一個增產計劃，必須以銷路作爲對象。而一個工業或商業純正的獲利，是應該由貨品的實銷方而獲得利潤的。</p>
<p>在敵偽盤踞時代，因爲幣制貶値，貨源缺乏，沒有人會顧到貨品的銷路問題，也無需顧到銷路，祇要把原料或製成品囤積起來，就可以得到盈利，因此向來被人忽略的推銷術，更爲擱置一旁，不去應用。</p>
<p>可是現在的情形不同，貨品擱置起來，祗會捐失利息，不會有助於生產，唯有以優美的貨品，擴展銷路，可以使本身繁榮，而且可以奠定今後的基礎。</p>
<p>一個善於利用推銷術的人，能够把貨品售得較高的價格，較多的數量，較廣遠的區域，而得到更多更滿意的主顧。</p>
<p>一般人對於貨品的銷路，實在有一點知其然而不知其所以然的情形。這神情形一方面是人才缺乏，同時在中國要實行市塲調査或市况分柝，也不容易進行。但是爲今之計，一定要用更多的力量，時間和精神來按照科學方法實行推銷工作。因爲一方面在生產者本身急需要擴展銷路，同時在購買力薄弱的時候，更需要用科學化的推銷術來解除困難，克服障礙。</p>
<p>筆者以爲從本年起，每一個組織中的每一個人，應該訓練成爲一個優良的推銷員。這裏所說的推銷員是廣義而不是狹義的。</p>
<p>狹義的推銷員是推銷一件貨品，完成售貨的工作，廣義的推銷員是造成社會良好的印象，獲得社會的同情，購買的動作，未必立刻產生，但已經預先做了一點基本的工作，到了相常時候就會引成購買的動作的。</p>
<p>把這個廣義的推銷，說得明顯一點，那末商店工廠職員和二悅色的接待顧客，主管人員日夜努力的精神表現，使對內對外能產生好感，資方勞方能推誠相見的情感結果獲得勞資協調，几此種種，都可以說是廣義的推銷的效果。</p>
<p>本來推銷術Salesmanship是一種最實用的學術，無論個人，工廠，國家都可以應用而獲得成功。按照目前的情形，大家來做推銷員，也許是一僩很合宜的提議。</p>
<h3>農業改進要目</h3>
<p>— 范希</p>
<p>（一）種子改良：要使農業生產增加，必需改良種子，試想沒有良種，怎樣繁殖出優秀的後代來呢？關於種子的改良，最好設置育種塲，育成優良純種，然後再分配給農民：勝利後，育種塲的設立，還是少得可憐！</p>
<p>（二）病蟲防治：我國農作的病蟲害屢見不鮮，例如蝗蟲，螟蟲，銹病等，每年總是要在稻麥上發生的；因爲連年的兵災，農作的病蟲防治，幾乎被忽略了，農業生產的前途，多麼令人焦慮啊！</p>
<p>（三）農產加工：農產品要使它保存久遠，必需要加工處理，稻穀，棉花，蔬果……無一不需加工的，道種加工的技術，也是亟待硏究改良的！</p>
<p>（四）改進運輸</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>人事管理的實施　（五）如何使職工工作</p>
<p>因爲使職工能够長時期地爲一個企業組織或工廠服務，可以說是人事管理方面一個重要原則。因此在招請和選擇職工的時候，一定要嚴格從事，等到應用以後，那末，就要想方法使他們長時期地服務，因爲職工的一再調動，對於企業組織或工廠方面，都是不利的。　在這種地方，尤其是專門的技術人才，更不能讓他們自由調動，對於使職工長時期爲企業組織或工廠服務，通常有下列幾種方法：</p>
<p>一，同業協定</p>
<p>無論製造那一種貨品，或是經營那一種事務，在市面上終有同業存在着，譬如說，我們開設一家製藥廠，那末市面上有許多其他藥廠，在我們廠裏的工作人員，如果辭職而到了別個製造廠去的時候，對於我們廠中的秘密或製造方式，不免洩漏。這在我們是不利的，反轉來講，如果別家的職工，到了我們的廠裏來時，那末那一家製造廠，就要有不利的情形，果然有時候爲了營業上的關係，不免互相鈞心鬥角，用盡方法去羅致別家的職工，但是我們能够去爭奪別家的職工，別家廠商，同樣地也可以爭奪我們的職工，爲了彼此的利害起見，於是就有同業協定的方法，就是由幾家比較接近的同業，來一個協定，說明決不雇用對方的職工，就是甲廠裏決不雇用乙廠的職工，也不用其他任何手段去羅致工廠的職工，這個辦法，能够使甲乙兩廠同時得到保障。但是這方法還是屬於消極方面的，除了消極方面防止以外，還需要做積極方面的工作，那就是考慮到職工的待遇問題，一定要使他們能够安心工作，如果他們能够安心工作，那末也決不願意到外面去謀發展了。</p>
<h3>農業產量日低　危機急待挽救</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>中國是以農立國的邦國，在增產運動聲中，如何使農產增加，當然是一個十分重要的問題。然而使我們失望的，近來農村經濟，每况愈下，勝利以來，非但不能使農產增加，相反地，竟在减少下來。筆者對於此一問題，曾作觀察與調査，就研究所得，略輸管見如下。</p>
<p>敝鄕松江，是個產米之區，全縣居民之中，務農爲業者佔百分之几十以上，就調査結果，知道平常的年頭，如果風調雨順，變幻不生，那一畝稻田可產白米三担。就是年成稍爲差些，也得二担以上。但近年以來，却在减少，尤其今歲，天時相當好，蟲害也不發現，而一般的農田，最佳者僅產米兩担，壞些的不到兩担，否則如此年頭，總有三担希望。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？主要的一點當然爲了農村經濟已感枯竭，好多農民，在借貸中生活，借米借錢，受到高利貸的壓迫。借錢月息兩角以上，借米每担月利一斗。要求田產的增加施肥充分，是件要事，然而在米價過賤，肥料昂貴的情形下，多數農民，不能把充分的肥料施下由中，肥料一少，自然要影響到生產效果。每年如此，經不得兩三年的壓迫和歉收，一部分農民已有無力種田的苦衷，迫他們離開晨村到都市中去找工作，而都市又在鬧不景氣，進退不得，陷於絕境。兩三年沒人種的荒田，正逐漸加多，長此以下，米糧的生產，勢必有减無增，危害將日深呢！</p>
<p>針對上面幾點，非先使農民解除高利貸的壓迫不可，所以銀行的農村貸款，不能再遲，且須普遍，使各村的貧農，得以低利向銀行貸款，俾在施肥之時，可有力多購。而使各種肥料，抑低售價，也是要務。而且上面所說的一畝產米三担，多數田畝尙未達最高產量，換句說話，若使施以更多的肥料，則產米可達三担以上。所以當局更要鼓勵農民，比戰前施以更多的肥料。最後，米價與各種物價的比率，也應平均，否則各物皆貴，惟米獨賤，也足迫使農民少施肥料，離田他去，影響農業生產。所謂毅賤傷農，小則影響農民生活，農村經濟，大則有關國家生產效果，前途危害，莫甚於此，是不可不防的！</p>

<h3>文藝與進步</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>文藝與促進社會有很大的關鍵。維多利亞時代的作家，雖然以離開眞實爲一時風尙，近於虛飾，但却助長了良好政風。自從象徵主義，新理想主義代替了寫實　流，心理學，自然科學闖進了象牙塔的大門，它又佐證了科學。文獻學也在十餘年前世界化了，如沙特威爾之流，他們簡直將文藝的研究，當做科學，承繼着泰奴，都另具一個非純文學的步調。</p>
<p>究竟將文藝效用化，或使之其有促進社會的功能，單在表現上講，應帶些什麽原素呢？這一點，各有見解與立塲。而能使之在將來具着存在價値的，自當離不了新。過去的方式與內容思想，無論怎樣估它的價値，都不能認爲有時代性。具備了新的條件，然後再求適合別的足以稱爲促進社會的條件。</p>
<p>我們需要一些像狄福而比他更舉術的作家：需要拉伯萊，法朗士，使我們輕鬆的發笑；需要雪吳，安特蓀寫農村裏平常的故事；需要亞列克謝，託爾斯陶，寫歷史的民族的英雄；需要威爾士寫科學的幻想，足以昭示未來的預言報道；需要的翰沁孤那迷離的夢似的傳奇；需要梅特林克那象微的手法，啓迪着光明的理想。</p>
<p>不必多說文藝以外的培植與輔修，生活以外的生活默察與歷險，這些手段，助長於新內容，那就是一個學生也知道的。現實是科學的，但每個人都容易從它感覺煩惱。理想是哲學一元化的，但它容易逃遁，容易踏空，似乎完全沒有它，也不免覺得藝術本身的空泛。</p>
<p>忘掉了現實，幾乎是過去十多年與目前一致傾向。一九四三至四四年的西南文壇，差不多以抽掉那時候的現實作爲求得安慰的手段。當今何嘗不是一樣？求得非現實的安慰與享樂，忘掉昨夜的光與創傷，這成了一般心理的趨勢，不能說是非過。但我們希望在這潮流中要求藝術化，要求適應促進社會的一條目。古希臘的繆斯有九個，每一個司一部份。豈可說抒情詩就是詩，興表現劇就是戲劇麽？廿七，十二，民卅六，</p>
<h3>殘箋</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>扳着指頭算算，恰正是一年了。</p>
<p>一年了！假使你在天的靈魂裏還留着一縷未滅的記憶，也許你會和我同樣地想着。當然我決不願意你這樣想，也決不願意我自己這樣想。在生死遙闊的阻隔下，更絕對不容許我們這樣想。可是在這雪厚風緊的正月初邊，在這凄凉寂寞的寒冬的夜裏，在這黯然無聲的燈光之下，我終於一又記起了你。記起了你，雖然我不再像以前一樣的唏噓流淚，但我還是按不住一顆沉痛的心，明知道你不能聽見，却依然要痴痴地吿訴你。</p>
<p>吿訴你，我是五個月以前離開那個小城的。那個小城，不是我早就對你說我要離開。我說我是一頭振羽待飛的小島，等到時機成熟，向天一衝，永不歸來。我又說我是籬下的落花，期待着豪俠的風暴，把我帶往自由的洋海和藍天。我還說最遲到四月杏花盛開的時候，我一定僕僕地在旅途上了。然而那裏想到，我負着一個小小的包裹離開小城的日子，四月的杏花早已開過，五月的薔薇也已凋謝，六月裏野攻塊的枯瓣落遍了小城的田野，七月的驕陽已經懶懶地西偏了。</p>
<p>當然我不敢騙你，對你說一切都是爲着你。我也不敢騙你，說是那些日子裏始終念着你。但是我決不騙你：當那個雷雨交作的晚上，我的脚尖踏上那個繁華的都市的時候，心中只有一樣東西，就是你！</p>
<p>你不要以爲這是兒戲，以爲年輕人最灼熟的情感，也不過像一個奇異的花炮，即使在黑暗的夜色中放出過奇絕豔絕的光彩，也終必在無聲無息的時間的洪流裏熄滅。何况我們，經過了生的掙扎，死的磨鍊，數不淸的驚濤駭浪和數不淸的困苦艱難，最後像二片狂風中的殘葉，偶然落在一起，又偶而分開，這有什麼希奇？有什麼値得回憶和慨嘆？</p>
<p>我們的生命是草尖的露珠，滾滾而來，滾滾而去，消滅自己吧！只要讓枯了的小草復活過來！記得有一位詩人曾這樣說過，我也這樣承認。所以當初你用乞憐的眼光向我舉起那隻杯子，我明知道那杯子裏盛着的不是芬芳的瓊漿，而是難嚧的苦液，也終於毅然接了過來，含着眼淚吞下了。你聽見我愉快的聲音：「我願意。」但是你沒有聽見我心裏的一句話：「爲了你！」</p>
<p>我曾千百次的懊悔，萬千次的悲怨：爲什麽在那個濃霧瀰漫的日子以前；在我們年靑的生命如鮮花一樣澯爛的春天；在生的斬頭，死的鎖鏈，千重的苦難和萬重的威脅未壓上我們肩胛的時候，我不能够認識你？不能够和你一同披上了堅硬的戰甲，去抵禦那迎面撲來的風濤和霹靂？</p>
<p>我認識你的時候，豈但是濃霧瀰漫，竟是在風暴雨，渾沌的天地，幾乎到了毁滅的時候了！</p>
<p>我何嘗不知道自己的軟弱，何嘗不知道你是住在光明的天涯，我是經住暗黑的海角。除非山海翻騰，除非生靈毁滅，除非有一天眞理的火焰燒毀了這邪惡的世代，縱使我們奮鬥得骨碎肉裂，也永遠無法消除那阻隔在我們中間的距離。</p>
<p>然而縱然隔着無法測量的距離，我們終於不顧一切，毅然把生命和靈魂同時獻上了眞理的祭台！</p>
<p>你就此在那眞理的祭台上儀牲了自已；永離了我；永別了光明的天日和美麗的人間！</p>
<p>一年了！我孤獨地離開了那個小城，孤獨地走進繁華的都市。我在都市的馬路上尋找過你的足跡，尋找過你的音容笑顏，尋找過你殷紅的鮮血和枯乾的白骨。我幾乎像一個痴狂的瘋子，在車馬矗　和燈光迷眩中，奔來跑去。四個月工夫，勝過冗長的四年。我的黑亮的頭髮枯黄了，圓潤的臉頺尖瘦了，那雙圓大明亮的眼睛，是你以前引爲驕傲得意的，快失去活人的光彩。我至在深夜的黄浦江頭，喊着你，苦苦地喊着你。……</p>
<p>然而我喊不到你。你的虫，你的骨，你的音容和你的足跡，早已給許多巨大的脚底，粗硬的脚底，釘着鐵錘的脚底，……踏去了，無情地路去了！</p>
<p>我失望地離開繁華的都市，在一個月前，某一個細雨濛濛的日子。我跨上一節擁擠的火車，摸出一塊籃色的手帕抹着眼角的淚珠，那塊手帕的角上，還留着你親筆寫的名字。</p>
<p>一年了！在這凄凉寂寞的陌生的小地方，連一朶小花都尋找不到。祗有兩行苦淚和一顆不變的心，敬獻於你受離周年的今天。（卅六年二月審於雲間）。</p>
<h3>高植的爲人</h3>
<p>— 鳴春</p>
<p>中國文壇上，有人以十年的時間，埋頭譯著，一任生活報子的抽擊，却始終堅守崗位，默默自得；等到他的譯著問世，別人才驚其卷帙浩繁，暗暗歎一聲「好傢伙，讀一遍都不容易，虧他耐心譯出。」高植就是這種人。</p>
<p>假使一個人注意過戰前的新月，北斗，東方雜誌，申報月刊，新中華，國聞周報，大公報等刊物，高植這名字大的並不陌生吧？</p>
<p>大學讀書時，他還是班上頂有趣的大孩子。聽講時，他常在請義上畫些小人小狗一類的滑稽畫，或者分給隔座同學幾顆花生米。他大衣口袋裏，往往不離零食。</p>
<p>他怪聰明，英文挺好，小說散文也寫得够漂亮，他改造漢字的主張，林語堂先生曾極端贊許。</p>
<p>十年一別，他不但做了敎授，並且成爲研究托爾斯泰的專家，幾乎是中國唯一的專家了。假如你看過大公報星期文繭（卅五，十二，十五）他發表的「托爾斯泰描寫心理轉變時的伴奏法」那篇文字，你不會懷疑我的結論的，對托氏著作不窺全豹的人，那種文章是不能著一字的。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的重要著作，如「戰爭與和平」，「安娜·卡列尼娜」，「復活」，「幼年，少年，靑年」，他全部譯過了。</p>
<p>據說上海有位以譯俄國社會科學書籍出名的大學者翻譯時，故把俄文原本擺在書桌上，抽屜裏面却放了日譯本，有人訪他却只看到桌上擺的俄文原本，好呌人震驚他的語言天才。</p>
<p>高植不求人震驚，他認爲直譯俄文算不得什麽一回事。</p>
<p>因爲他英文好，俄文也好，許多人都問他是那一國留學生，或者是否從莫斯科回來。殊不知他是曾從南京到重慶，現又由重慶回南京的道道地地的中華民國留學生。</p>
<p>他熱愛譯作生活，正如熟愛其生命。他又憧憬着人生與世界的遠景。他想把自己和別人一同渡到充滿陽光與花草的彼岸。</p>
<p>他對生活有目的，有信心，無煩惱，少寂寞，堅守着文化崗位，固執的進取。他下知失敗爲何事，而失敗也永遠不會光臨一個充滿活力的人的。</p>
<p>筆者認爲在人欲横流，急功近利的今日，而文藝界究竟還能露顯些璀璨，類乎高植這種人是値得尊敬的。</p>
<h3>梅花古衲—新安派畫人之一</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>釋弘仁，字漸江，歙人，性愛梅，人稱梅花古衲；俗姓江，名韜，字六奇，號鷗盟，少孤，事母至孝；明諸生。母棄世，不婚不仕，入閩游武夷，依古航禪師爲　，嘗居黄山齊　，所作山水，早年學宋人，後師雲林，得蕭疎澹逸之趣，與　殘道濟齊名，而能獨創一格。</p>
<p>漸江上人，筆精　妙，與休寗汪之瑞，海陽査士標，徽州孫無逸，合稱新安派四大家，汪，査，孫三氏，高情横逸，品格獨絕。</p>
<p>歙縣西門外，越太平橋，經太白樓；而入西干風景區，流水淙淙，喬木蔭天，拾級而上，築有梅花古衲　道，路旁遍植梅花，横斜疎影，境極幽邃，其上即漸江上人裏。抗戰前，邑人江彤侯議長，生持重修者，長慶塔，披雲峯，分列前後，隔岡新建洗桐居士汪采白先生墓，邑人公葬於此，兩代藝人，各峙東西，與河嶽日星同埀不朽矣！</p>
<h3>題多慈畫岩松圖</h3>
<p>— 許紹棣</p>
<p>縣崖　刺千萬千，虬枝夭矯摩天闕；籠吟萬　生悲風，眼底烟雲幻奇話；人間桃柳總玲瓏，翻咲髯翁嗚高潔；君不見天寒地凍山拆裂，萬木蕭蕭齊摧折；唯有瓊台松，凌霜犯雪鱗如鐵</p>
<h3>歙縣西干寫景</h3>

<h3>迎春草</h3>
<p>— 胡訥</p>
<p>在嚴寒的冬天裏，大地像是罩上了一層灰暗的紗籠似的，天空老是浮着灰色的雲塊，不是下雨，就是飄雪，使人幾乎透不出氣，陶中像是壓着沉重的鉛塊似的。</p>
<p>幸喜春天可能會在冬夭的後面跟踪而至，大地的陰沉也會一掃而空，帶來的是蓬勃，新鮮，美麗，使人有生氣的時日。</p>
<p>正如英國詩人雪萊說得好：「冬天來了，春天還會遠嗎？」</p>
<p>不是嗎？那時候，大地上是一片的生氣勃勃，田野裏農人們唱着單調可愛的收歌，草木長起了一片新綠，迎接着新春的陽光，一片煥發的朝氣，散佈在整個的自然界。</p>
<p>潛伏着的，死去了的，都在春天新生了。</p>
<p>春，象微着年靑有爲的靑年，進取的雄心，遠大的前程，多少有爲的哲人學者，不都是在靑年立下了他們不朽的基業，讓光輝的，明亮的光耀，永遠照着世人！</p>
<p>春天啊！我們歌頌你，你帶給世人多少新生的希望！</p>
<h3>散文二章</h3>
<p>— 莊然</p>
<p>燈</p>
<p>電燈熄滅之後，我燃起了蠟燭。</p>
<p>從黑暗的統治中，掙扎了出來，我對周遭熟悉的一切，投以親切而熱情的眼光。</p>
<p>從今，無視那黑暗中陰森的，猙獰的面孔，一切混亂和空虛。一點光明，帶來了我們的溫暖和信心。</p>
<p>就想起了窗外天空裏的寒星，亮晶晶的發射着它美麗的光芒，在寒風凜冽的夜裹，給多少無眠的人帶來了崇高的慰藉！而對着穹蒼，想着壯觀的宇宙，一顆顆星星的光明，會織成千萬條宇宙的經緯。</p>
<p>而人類也畢竟有了燈，有了燈就有了光明，在黑夜裏，也織成了人類的壯觀的宇宙。</p>
<p>「那麼，老誰，別讓燈給窓外的寒風吹熄了！」我們在燈下要趕完一件工作，窓外夜色更濃了，雨點打在窗格上，燈光搖搖欲墜。</p>
<p>「喂！看遠處也有燈光近了」。而接着更鑼饗了。</p>
<p>我們在走向黎明。</p>
<p>雨</p>
<p>下雨了，感覺得厭煩嗎？</p>
<p>泥濘的路，再加上寒風，傘幾乎撐不住了。一不留神，便會失足滑倒在泥漿裏，或許倒在道旁積滿汚水的田溝裏，——而前面還有很遙遠的路。</p>
<p>該怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>想着春天的雨點會使那靑靑的草兒茁長，想着夏天的雨點會洗凈滿天的　囂，而帶來無限的淸新：</p>
<p>想着雨點會洗去地上的汚濁；想着雨點會雙作長江的洪流，汹汹的奔流向大海……</p>
<p>想着掙扎在凄風苦雨中的人們，苦難的一羣，爲自己的理想；也想着在有着狂風暴雨的夜裏，燈塔的守望者燃起那一星燈光，爲多少迷路的指示方向……</p>
<p>想着風暴後的安靜；想着雨後的一個美麗的晴期的天氣。那麽，就議雨繼續的下着吧</p>
<p>而我該從跌倒的地方爬起來了，再走上路。</p>
<p>明天該會是一個晴朗的日子。</p>

<p>第七章　「八」之秘密</p>
<p>「那麽，萍子也上這兒（北平）來了嗎」？</p>
<p>鶴見和我見面之後，他把到日本從參加黑龍會起，直到搜索「七封秘緘」失敗，受命飛回大陸爲止，一應細節，都繪聲繪形，一時京腔，一時日語，傾筐倒　，都給我說了一個磬盡。我把他所說這段故事，大綱節目和幾個要點，都記了下來，其中雖有幾點不大淸楚，現在可沒有閒空追問；心下却急於要曉得這位神秘小姐萍子的踪跡，無以靜心聽完了他的故事，才這們問了一句。</p>
<p>「我是趕飛機來的」，鶴見吿訴我，」萍子，還有萍子口裏的那個「滿洲雌狗」，皆在瀋陽總部落脚，大的還有些鬼勾當…不過」！鶴見說到這裏，忽然頓住，好像想起了一件什麽很大困難的問題，需要細心思索似的，便重新燃上了一隻烟捲，在屋子裏來回　蹀着。這是他的老牌　我只好不驚擾他，僅僅坐在一旁，整理我的紀事册，把遺漏了的日，時，地點，等等，一一補上。</p>
<p>我們現在會面的地點，正是北平唯一安全隱秘的所在—「北平××飯店」（讀者請見諒，直到今日，這個所在，外有秘密的必要，未得某某機要機關同意，仍難宣佈）。我從通州，偕同耀羣小姐和小老虎回來之後，蒙W君美意，把我們幾個人一齊留下，盡量款待，除了有要事，必須出外，都在這第五層樓上盤桓。在「〇好四號」和幾個精悍手下也在這裏，秘密電訊，也都在這裏收發，樓上還有W君的通訊器具，十分方便。所以鶴見一到北平，我們就去把他接了來，好讓他安安靜靜休息一下。</p>
<p>鶴見在屋子裏來回走了幾轉，忽然站住，瞧着我「老大哥，您想這個「八」字，究竟怎麽解釋」？</p>
<p>「八一？我一時莫明其妙，反而問着他。</p>
<p>鶴見聽我這一問，大的看見我有些楞頭楞腦的一副呆像，有些好笑，不覺哈哈大笑起來：</p>
<p>「老大哥，您也不見得十分高明吧，也許腦筋用過了頭，有些不大靈敏了？怏怏…也弄根烟捲吧，機器無論如何精緻見巧，總是需要加油的」。他一面說笑，一面扔給我一根軍用的極品烟捲。</p>
<p>「你錯了」，我一面吸上烟捲，一面說，「我問的是萍子的率，你沒有把問題答覆完滿，忽然又扯上了『八』的問題；可是我的腦想中，還在思索萍子哩。」</p>
<p>「這個『八』正是萍子的事」，　見忽地收了笑容，滿臉堆總了心事，「我預料她替東京方面，負擔着很重要的使命。一路上用手指拍着電訊方式談話的常口，她老是有些神魂不定，這是心裏有事的表現。普通小問題，決計離她不倒；叫她神魂不定，必是很大的問題。我也曾經追問過她幾次，她却掩掩藏藏的，用閒話岔開，直到在瀋陽送我上飛機臨時才吐露了一句—叫我留心『八』的秘密。我想『八』的秘密，並不難解釋，可就料不　是哪一方面的一。</p>

<h3>健兒不復還！　許承基病逝英京　中國體育界一大損失</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>是中國體育界上一個無從估計的重大損失！網球國手許承基在上月卅一日病逝英倫，急性肺炎，毁滅了這曾經光耀世界體育舞台的巨星。從此，又不知等待何年何月，來做台維斯初勝的夢！</p>
<p>承基是網球天才，中國的體育界上什麼都及不上西方諸國，僅有的光榮是許君在默洲各國的網球賽中所獲得的各項錦標。他獲得過全英硬地網球冠軍，及德克柏林，英國伯明罕等地錦標，惠勃爾登世界網球大會的選手及歷屆台維司盃的中國代表。十年來揚威海外，替中國體壇着實爭得不少面子。</p>
<p>當民國二十二年第二屆全國遝動大會在首都舉行時，邊遠省區及海外僑胞不憚跋涉，相率參加，許承基以巴達維亞網球選手的資格，第一次在國內正式比賽，打敗了上海選手。全運會的報告書上有一段描寫着許君的技藝</p>
<p>『許君運用特殊高妙的手腕，左右逢源，無孔不入，發球軍如砲彈。急抽如矢，直射底綫，或輕挑網邊，或攔網截殺，有時又以高球壓擊，猛殺過網，精采百出，掌聲雷動，許氏之按術，表演神化，誠爲國內所僅見。』</p>
<p>年僅弱冠轟動全國</p>
<p>那時，許君還只是個二十歲的靑年，已經轟動全國。二十四年受政府指派，與鄭兆佳赴美參加台維斯盃，許鄭各勝一盤，爲我國參加台盃三年來第一次收穫，二十五年我國改入歐洲帶比賽，仍由許君參加，比賽後留滯歐洲，潛心練習。半年中，參加過十二次比賽，共得了九個錦標，南歐六决，希臘二次，英國伯明罕一决。二十六年度台盃中許君的球藝，益見高超，英國每日先驅報許爲「中國第一名手的傑作」，惜配手不佳，遭了寃枉的失敗。</p>
<p>他臻達過惠勃爾登最後八人之一，打敗過兩决奧斯丁，幾　入世界第一琉網球家之列。法國國際錦標網球賽中，擊敗過法國第三名選手勒蘇，轟動整個巴黎，被譽爲拉柯斯德重見。</p>
<p>生長南國書生模樣</p>
<p>在綱球塲上看，承基並不是一個身材魁梧的人，池是個典型的南方人，擊球的姿勢，還帶着些「書生」氣息，沒有過分劇烈的動作，但常他擊出的球落到對方的陣地上，大家就會感到它的分量來。抗戰初期，他在南洋各地獻賽，捐款政府，後來敵燄益張，太平洋戰爭後，他在巴達維亞的故鄕　居，（他的健康，也許正是在那時受到了損害。）去年重出參加台維斯盃，威風更勝當年，結果雖然失敗，然而承基的單打却是每次必勝。</p>
<p>他不吸烟，不飲酒，自十三歲開始學習網球以來，始終努力練習不稍懈怠，除網球以外別無嗜好。外表上是一個文弱的書生，在網球塲上却是能苦戰五盤的饒將。他並有着良好的運動家風度，雖不隘瞞自己戰勝的喜悅心，但也不埋沒人家的長處，沒有不良運動員那種驕氣凌人。他是閩籍的南洋僑胞，除他故　的鄉語外，他會說些國語，在居留歐洲的時日中，又會說英語和荷蘭語，德法文也可對付。民廿九年一月在倫敦和英國網球健將鮑爾馥小姐結婚，但去年三月裏就離了婚。乃弟球藝亦佳，允稱雙絕</p>
<p>這樣一位認眞苦幹的中國靑年，才三十四歲竟爾病死，在國際體壇上，將又有誰來做第二個許承基呢？</p>

<p>六百萬元美金普遍配給</p>
<p>假如在你居住的小村中突然來了一批新人物，把六百萬美金分發給城中的居民，人人可以拿到一筆夢想不到的巨款，你想這事情可能嗎？你一定會說這是痴人說夢的吧？</p>
<p>但是，事有不可逆料者，約在一年半以前，捷克斯拉夫東北隅的薩斯丁村，的確得到了一筆飛來橫財。</p>
<p>事情發生在一九四五年四月末。當時德軍還佔領着這個局處於捷奧邊境的薩斯丁小村，當地僅有農民數千人，是一個冷落的村莊。蘇軍正迫近該村的消息傳出後，當地德國駐軍恐慌萬狀，他們準備向北往奧地利境內撤退。</p>
<p>在當時當做司令部的薩斯丁市政廳中，納粹司令官的眼光，注視着幾只七横八豎的箱子，其中裝滿着捷國的鈔票。這筆款子原來是納粹份子從勃拉鐵斯拉伐的捷克期拉夫國民銀行的鋇庫中搶刧出來的。</p>
<p>現在紅軍追踪而至，這個心神錯亂的納粹司令官決心把這筆數額驚人的鉅款放棄了。在司令部門外，一輛汽車正等着把他送到安全區去。車中當然放不下像鈔票箱那樣的龐然大物，於是他就把這幾只箱子鎖起來，把鑰匙放在袋裏，繼即把兩個由德國戰爭機構徵用的年輕斯洛伐克農民叫了進來。</p>
<p>德軍狼狽逃遁留下大量鈔票　「我把這幾只箱子留給你們保管，把它們好好藏好。你們兩人應負全責，日後倘使我回來——我們的軍隊一定會回來的——你們可以得到獎賞，明白嗎」？</p>
<p>這　個兵士就啞然地點點頭。不一刻，納粹軍官走了。這兩個受驚不淺的斯洛伐克人趕緊剝掉了德軍的制服，換上平民的服裝，嬌上自由車，飛也似的跑到鄕下去了。至於這幾只箱子，仍舊　在老地方。</p>
<p>翌儲，蘇軍一營佔領薩斯丁，當然　，蘇軍第一個搜尋的目標，無疑是前納粹司令部，而最引人注意的就是這幾只箱子。營長把其中的一只打開，檢起了幾扎鈔票。怎樣處置它們呢？倒是一個難題。</p>
<p>爲了要明瞭這位蘇聯軍官的此一行動，我們必須記得這批蘇聯軍隊是屬於柯聶夫將軍麾下的，遠自史達林格勒，，輾轉推進。他們不斷地作戰，一週復一週，一月復一月，心裏祗存着一個念頭：「攻入柏林或者死」。</p>

<h3>感慨話西沙！</h3>
<p>— 高武弘</p>
<p>勝利以後，中國列爲「四强」之一，法國因國內尙待整頓，而未曾列入。後來「四强」改爲「五强」，加了一强，以法國塡中國之位，而將中國退居末位。我們眼看人家迅速地回復了國際地位，而我們則甫上台階，又退了下來，眞覺得無窮慚惡。最近法軍突又藉詞「代安南收回主權」，在西沙羣島登陸，侵害我國主權，使中法邦交，發生了遺憾。法蘭西在淪陷時，中國曾寄以極大的同情和呼援、中法二國，同是　求自由和平的國家，而今法國竟趁我國內局勢未定之際，以武力侵佔西沙羣島，實深遺憾。</p>
<p>即使西沙羣島的「主權」屬於安南，法國要「代」安南「收回」，也應以外交方式進行，不應遽以軍隊進駐，何况據白　　聲明：「歷史上證明該島　　中國一，法國　種行　，自是　　佔，　　　　　權？　又建議請國際仲裁這一問題。我們認爲，西沙羣島事件，純粹是中法二國的外交問題，可由中法自己來解決，不必勞動國際，如果法方有誠意的話。「國際仲裁」，等於二個小孩子吵翻了架，拉出大人來「打圓塲」，說句公道話，大人聽雙方的言語，各執一詞，究竟不知帮了那一面好，是不會有多大效果的。</p>
<p>「九一八」事件，「一二八」事件，都會請出國際來仲裁，有了什麼結果沒有？不想今日的法國又來玩這一套把戲，撫今追昔，眞覺感慨糸之，不勝唏噓！</p>

<p>生於美國檀香山的中國名醫師蕭（譯音）某，夏威夷大學畢業，現年三十歲，原任費城軍需庫生物實騐所長，現正率領美國科學家多人，從事研究消滅細菌的方法；該項菌類，在太平洋戰爭時，予軍事設備及服裝損耗甚大，醫學界雖已發明了好幾種殺菌藥，並可消滅四十萬種菌類，尙有　　　　，　　　　　　　　　殺滅·據陸軍部宣稱：「目前的研究，由蕭君領導，並有美國細菌學家，菌類學家與生物學家著名者多人爲輔助，現已頗有成就。……</p>
<p>曾經有一位外國的學者說過：一中國人有着聰明的頭腦和過人的機智，但是大多數人不能善加利用，或是限於經濟，無諭什麼事情，學得了一些皮毛，就半途而廢，不再深造。如能精益求精，細心揣摩，再加以經濟力量的帮助，其成就實可遠超他人之上。」</p>
<p>由蕭君領導美國科學家硏究滅菌方法這一件事看來更證明了此說言之非謬，希望大家看了這節消息，深自警惕，好自爲之，不要事負了天賦給我們的臘和手！</p>
<h3>如果羅斯福不死</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>一月三十日是美國故羅斯福總統的誕辰，美全國各地嗚鐘紀念，追思美國歷史上最偉大的總統之一。生前，羅斯福有不少政敵，可是死後却極少人說他壞話，羅氏人格之偉大，於此可見。羅斯福死後，迄蔣兩載，世界的局面，矛盾複雜，反不若戰時那樣能團結一致，在羅斯福總統的誕辰，我想每一個美國人，甚至世界上任可國家的人民，心由　存　　　問題，就是：假如今日羅斯福仍活着，世界的大局將怎樣？</p>
<h3>日本工人「進步」了！</h3>
<p>— 源</p>
<p>在過去一週中，日本醞釀大罷工，預定於二月一日全國一致發動。據說各地罷工工人包括同情罷工者在內，總數將達八百六十萬人之多，可以說是歷史上最大的工潮，假如日本勞工界眞的不顧麥帥禁令，如期舉行，實將「蔚爲奇觀」！所怪者，這輩會經爲日本軍閥効勞極久協助進行侵略戰爭的日本工人，突然間會變得如此「進步」，如此「民主」，好像比民主先進國家的工人還要激烈似的，是不是日本人眞的「醒覺」了？</p>
<h3>英國和蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 佳原</p>
<p>自從蒙帥訪問莫斯科後，英蘇關係的演變，又爲舉世所矚目。有人說英蘇盟約不但縱續有効而且要延長了，也有人說英蘇已訂立秘密協定，把近東和巴爾幹方面的勢力範圍都劃定了……可是另一方面，蘇聯却仍在抨擊英國，說效和美國已訂立聯合抗蘇的秘密協定，而英國也在冷　熟嘲，　責蘇聯的不是。實際上，今日的英議關係，和蒙帥未訪蘇前並沒有什麽兩樣，世人對於蒙帥訪蘇這一個插曲，未免太重視了！</p>

<h3>Communist Forces in Southern Shandong Decimated; National Army Clamps Down on Linyi from Two Directions; Pacification Work Begins in Tancheng</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Chairman Chiang flew to Xuzhou on the morning of the 2nd at 10:00 am aboard the Meiling special plane. Only Chen Cheng and Xue Yue greeted him at the Xuzhou airport. The Chairman had lunch in Xuzhou and met with Chen and Sa. He returned to the capital at 2:30 pm, with Chen Cheng returning to Nanjing on the same plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] (1) The main forces of the Communist army in southern Shandong are showing a tendency to flee towards the mountains, and Linyi is in a state of panic. (2) The National Army stationed in Tancheng is currently restoring local order and carrying out pacification work in the surrounding villages. (3) The three columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui were seen fleeing towards the territory of Luyi and Boxian on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] After the National Army captured Tancheng and pressed on Linyi, the Communist 9th Division had been dispatched from Mengyin, 54 miles northwest of Linyi, to reinforce the Communist forces defending Linyi. At the same time, the National Army under Wang Yaowu is also moving south from Jinan to attack Linyi from both sides.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist army in southern Shandong is nearing the end of its rope, becoming increasingly restless. Due to the previous fighting on the Heli branch line, where they suffered as many as 50,000 casualties, and the defection of Hao Pengju and his troops for dual reasons, their military and political control has completely collapsed. The main force of the Communist army in the area north of Lincheng has been rapidly advancing east towards Taierzhuang day and night, indicating their intention to concentrate their main force to defend and attack the area. The Communist army's illusion of pincering Xuzhou has now become a pipe dream.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army is currently advancing northward, stationing in Tiefo Temple, Shibu and other places on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong on the 1st. There are no longer any Communist disturbances in Pi County.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The war situation in southern Shandong took a sudden turn for the worse. The National Army recovered Dabu, 35 miles north of Tancheng, at 4:00 pm yesterday, and the Communist army was routed and retreated towards Linyi. In addition, the National Army advancing north from Pi County entered Changcheng Town in Luxu today, while another National Army unit is approaching Lanling Town.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] There are no major battles in Jiaodong and northern Shandong today. The Jiaoji Railway was not damaged by the Communist army last night, creating a peaceful situation not seen since the Spring Festival. The focus of the war is still in southern Shandong. Qualified observers believe that it should be absolutely no problem for the National Army to occupy Linyi, the highest command post of the Shandong Communist forces, ten days ago.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 2nd] Communist forces were discovered on the outskirts of Shangqiu, attempting to besiege Shangqiu. The Longhai Railway was damaged, and trains from Xuzhou to Bian only reached Shangqiu. Fighting occurred near Minquan.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 1st] Han Dedong, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, flew from Xuzhou to Haizhou by special plane yesterday afternoon to oversee the local pacification work.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Attack Qihe County; Fierce Fighting Near Xiguan; Tai'an City Widely Damaged by Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist forces attacked Qihe County starting at 9:00 pm on the 2nd, engaging in fierce fighting with the National Army several miles outside Xiguan.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist forces in various parts of Shandong are actively taking action, and a full-scale war is about to break out. Approximately 20,000 Communist troops from the wings of Qihe County are gathering more than ten miles west of the city, threatening to attack Qihe. In addition, the "Eleventh" and "Twelfth" Divisions of the Bohai Military Region of the Communist army have arrived north of Ancheng, preparing to attack Ancheng, and the National Army is strictly guarding against them. Xiong Jiming, the commissioner of the district, was injured while breaking through from Weizhai, and his whereabouts were still unknown as of the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 1st] After Li Yingxiang's troops broke through from Weizhai and retreated to Daweijiazhuang, the Communist army followed up with a fierce attack at midnight on the morning of the 1st. Li's troops counterattacked, retreating and advancing three times, and finally repelled the Communist army in February. However, Sanguancheng nearby, which was guarded by the Pingyin County Security Team, was captured by the Communist army. The above all occurred within Qihe County. Qihe and Zhencheng are firmly defended by the National Army and are safe, but the outskirts of Jinan are tense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] Large buildings inside Tai'an City have been widely damaged by the Communist army. Piles of firewood have been stacked in various places in Dai Temple, and the fate of this ancient site with thousands of years of history is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Fighting South of Baoding; Cannon Fire Shakes the City Walls</h3>
<p>The Communist Forces Attacking Xushui Have Been Repelled</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist forces that fiercely attacked Xushui on the 1st failed to achieve their goal and retreated at 6:00 pm. They returned in the evening to fiercely attack various strongholds of the National Army between Xushui and Caohejian but were again repelled by the National Army. In addition, Da Ran, south of Baoding, was also fiercely attacked by more than 3,000 Communist troops last night. The sound of cannon fire shook the walls of Baoding, and the fierce fighting continued throughout the night. The Communist army retreated at 4:00 am this morning, leaving behind sixty corpses.</p>
<h3>Major Bridge on PingSui Railway Blown Up</h3>
<p>Damaged Sections of PingHan Railway Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] A major bridge between Kangzhuang and Huailai on the Pingsui Railway was blown up by the Communist army last night, and service on the Pingzhang section has been suspended today.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] The Zibo branch line of the Jiaoji Railway was again damaged by the Communist army on the 31st. When the railway bureau sent a team to repair it, they were also attacked by mines buried by the Communist army, and eight people were injured and rushed to Jinan for treatment.</p>
<h3>Communist Company Commander Defects</h3>

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the 8th Army Group, arrived in Pulandian on the afternoon of the 31st for inspection. The residents of the area, who have valued Han official ceremonies for 52 years, were quite excited. Since Pulandian was ceded after the Sino-Japanese War, Liao is the highest-ranking official to have personally visited this place after its recovery by the National Army. In other news, part of an independent division of the Communist army is currently constructing strong fortifications along the east-west line of Xingshukou, south of Pulandian.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] There are still constant clashes between the National and Communist armies on the Pulandian front lines. Near Taishan, 20 li southeast of Pulandian, the Communist army fired mountain guns at the National Army positions on the evening of the 31st.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Suilamawan Disturb Helintuo County</h3>
<p>[Our Guisui Dispatch, 1st] The Communist forces in Lamanawan moved towards the northeast today and have formed a pincer attack on Helin County with another Communist force that has crossed the Da Hongcheng. Reinforcements have been dispatched from Guisui and are on alert at the line of Thief's Support (a few kilometers south of the city).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 2nd] On the afternoon of the 1st at 4:00 pm, more than 1,000 Communist troops were discovered a dozen li south of Heicheng, at the border between Helin and Tuo County, and have already made contact with our defending troops.</p>
<h3>Traffic Restored Between Beiping and Tianjin; Shangguan Yunxiang Arrives in Tianjin from Tangshan; Chen Jicheng Goes to Inspect the Beining Line</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] After the Pingjin Railway was damaged again, traffic was restored on the 2nd, but the Communist threat remains to be eliminated. Shangguan Yunxiang came to Tianjin from Tangshan at noon on the 2nd and has made some deployments for future military measures. After mines were quickly discovered on the Jinyu section for two consecutive days, the transmission line from Tangshan to Tianjin was also damaged by 200 meters before dawn on the 2nd, resulting in a loss of 4,000 kilowatts of power to Tianjin. Repairs are currently underway and are expected to be completed on the 3rd.</p>

<h3>Situation in Taiyuan Increasingly Tense; Communist Forces Discovered in Fenhe and Mengxian Areas; Yan Xishan Has Returned to Taiyuan to Personally Oversee Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The situation in Taiyuan is becoming increasingly tense. Yan Xishan returned to Taiyuan on the evening of the 29th to arrange defenses. It is reported that the "Twelfth," "Fifteenth," and "Thirtieth" regiments of the Communist army had moved from Taigu to villages near Liushigou, which belongs to Taiyuan, on the 30th. It is also reported that the Communist army in northern Shanxi is gradually moving south, attempting to attack the central Shanxi area. More than 10,000 troops under He Long have also been discovered west of the Fen River in Taiyuan, and a large force of Communist troops has also been discovered in the Mengxian area. Therefore, Yan Xishan hurriedly returned to Taiyuan to personally oversee operations. Since the Communist army gathered nine brigades in Fenxiao on the 16th of last month, Yan went to Pingyao on the 18th to supervise the troops. By the time he reached Xiaoyi, it had already fallen, and one force had moved to the Pingyao Jiexiu area, while another moved to Fenyang Wenshui. Yan immediately ordered Sun and Zhao's troops to block and attack in separate routes, inflicting considerable casualties on the Communist army.</p>
<h3>US Generals Hold Meeting; Discussing Procedures for US Military Withdrawal; Admiral Cooke and Minister All Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] US Army General Cooke, stationed in Qinghai, flew to Nanjing from Qinghai at 9:00 am on the 2nd. After disembarking, he went to the US Embassy, and the Minister summoned senior officials of the embassy and senior US Army and Navy generals in Nanjing to hold an important meeting to discuss the procedures and technical issues for the US military withdrawal from China. He left Nanjing by the same plane at approximately 3:00 pm to return to Qinghai.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 2nd] The families of nine US military officers from the Beiping Executive Headquarters were en route to Beiping aboard the transport ship "General Weigle." At the same time, the US Embassy in Nanjing happened to announce the withdrawal of US military personnel from the Executive Headquarters. The ship was thus moored in Tanggu Bay, awaiting instructions from Washington. The families remained on board. There is currently no definite date for the withdrawal of US military personnel from Beiping. It is reported that during the withdrawal period, the US Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force will be responsible for patrolling the Pingjin line.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of US Forces from North China; Announcement Possible Within Two Days</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] A United Press reporter learned today that the date for the withdrawal of US forces from North China may be announced within 48 hours. However, Communist guerrillas appear in the Pingjin Railway and highway, cutting off traffic. How to evacuate the 2,000 US personnel of the Executive Headquarters, including women and children, is quite complicated. In addition, the US military transport ship General Weigle, carrying the families of nine officers, twenty-one people, and one hundred and twenty-one soldiers, sailed to Tanggu. Originally, it was intended to ignore the US decision to withdraw from the Executive Headquarters and transport them to Beiping by plane, but this idea has now been abandoned, and the reason has not been explained. These officers' families do not intend to land in Tanggu.</p>
<h3>Communist Personnel of the Executive Headquarters</h3>
<p>Likely to Begin Withdrawal on the 5th</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The government side of the Executive Headquarters may end as early as next month, and Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi will be transferred to the position of military attaché at the US Embassy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] General Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the government side of the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to host a banquet at the Beijing Hotel on the afternoon of the 5th on behalf of government member General Zheng Jiemin to bid farewell to the Communist personnel of the department who are about to withdraw from Beiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] According to a person in charge of the government side of the Executive Headquarters, government personnel will withdraw from Beiping before the Communist and American personnel, and will await assignment. In addition, the Communist personnel have been busy packing for days and originally planned to start withdrawing on the 3rd. Due to flight availability, the departure will be delayed for two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] Du Yuming told reporters that the Communist personnel of the Changchun Executive Subcommittee who wish to go to Beiping or Harbin will be sent back by our side. As for the future of the Northeast, we will still act in accordance with the government's orders, and we will never attack first. External speculations that a major war is about to break out are premature. Du said: We are determined to do our best to protect traffic safety and are determined to thoroughly reorganize traffic order in Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Shanhaiguan. Deputy Commander Ma Zhanshan will come to Shenyang in the next few days, and the troops under his command will come together.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist personnel of the Executive Headquarters may begin their withdrawal on the 5th. The Communist Party submitted a note to the US side on the 1st regarding the withdrawal, and the Communist Party has not yet responded. Wang Liangke, previously sent by the Communist Party to Changchun to investigate the radio station incident, returned to Beiping this afternoon. It is reported that the Changchun Communist radio station has indeed been returned by the government, and the personnel there are also preparing to withdraw. According to the Communist Party, as of today, Yan'an has not sent any instructions to Beiping regarding the transfer of Communist personnel from the Executive Headquarters, and no clear orders have been issued. The Communist Party seems to be taking a cautious and uninterested attitude towards the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters. A certain Communist Party official told reporters: Although the US personnel have been ordered to withdraw, neither the Nationalists nor the Communists have ordered the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters, so its dissolution today seems illegal. He believes that the Executive Headquarters should be formally terminated in another way.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Regarding the proposal submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party to the government as rumored in Shanghai, the reporter inquired about Jiang Yuntian's proposal for even land distribution as its content. It is said that the Democratic Socialist Party's proposal was only a verbal opinion and not a concrete document. The Democratic Socialist Party hopes that the government will have a concrete opinion after the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and then the effective methods of the Democratic Socialist Party can also be put forward to help solve the current situation.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the China Youth Party</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng, a spokesman for the China Youth Party, said recently: "If the government does not clarify its attitude, this party does not intend to participate in the reorganization of the government. This party's line of action is that national concepts are more important than political concepts. The future Premier of the Executive Yuan should be trusted by the President of the Republic, enjoy international prestige, be supported by all parties, and be a financial expert. The reorganization of the government, the reorganization of the National Government Committee, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, and the reorganization of local governments should be carried out simultaneously, and the Communist seats in the National Government Committee should be reserved throughout."</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Returns to the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Wu Tiecheng returned to the capital from Shanghai at 7:00 pm on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Zhang Junmai is scheduled to publish eighteen essays in the short term as the basis for the "Party Doctrine" of the Democratic Socialist Party. He also plans to give public lectures in important cities in various provinces within this year, and only plans to go to the provincial capitals of the border provinces. As for the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, due to too many restrictions, he does not intend to go.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Commends Martyrs</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Executive Yuan, recognizing that Wang Yichong, the Kunshan County Library Director, and Lu Jian'an, a local gentleman, preserved documents and devoted themselves to education, both died of overwork. In addition, Deng Shaoyun, the County Magistrate of Hengshan in Xiang, died heroically defending the city during the enemy's attack on Hengshan. Yesterday, they were specially commended by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Imported into Hong Kong Reached 90,000 Taels Last Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd] According to statistics from the Hong Kong government customs, 90,000 taels of gold were imported into Hong Kong last year, worth (201,976,11) yuan, including gold bars (5,752,000) yuan and ink gold (14,445,611) yuan. Exports included (19,305,000) yuan to Macao and (4,243,700) yuan to North China. Last year, the Hong Kong government approved the import of 120,000 taels of gold, but only 90,000 taels were shipped to Hong Kong. The remaining 30,000 taels arrived in January of this year. The Hong Kong financial authorities believe that the influx of gold is sufficient to supply demand, and since the end of last year, they have stopped issuing gold import licenses. Gold merchants have instead applied for import licenses from Macao, requesting the Hong Kong government to allow them to transport gold through Hong Kong to Macao, with a requested amount of 500,000 taels, but only 250,000 taels were approved.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Hopes the Government Will Propose Solutions to Problems Such as Government Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Before the Chinese New Year's Eve, Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party returned to his hometown in Anhui for the New Year. Then, he received a telegram from Lei Zhen in Shanghai, urging him to go to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. Jiang arrived in the capital on the 31st and scheduled to visit Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and other important government officials on the 3rd. He will take the night train to Shanghai on the 3rd. The reporter recently visited Jiang and inquired about the Democratic Socialist Party's views on participating in the reorganization of the government. He replied as follows: Since the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, it cannot shirk its responsibility for constitutional government. Therefore, its basic principles for participating in the reorganization of the government will not change. However, there are currently two points to consider: (1) If the political atmosphere created by one party rule over the past 20 years cannot be improved, can the Democratic Socialist Party make a new change after participating in the government, and save the national crisis? (2) The Democratic Socialist Party jointly formulated the constitution with the government, and will not shirk its responsibility for constitutional government, but if the current situation does not change, it is not certain whether it can assume the responsibility of constitutional government. According to Jiang, the statement by Zuo Juesheng published in a Nanjing evening newspaper today, saying "how much connection is there between Zhang Jun of the Democratic Socialist Party and Zhang Dongsheng of the Democratic League?" is not true. Because this party is currently considering the above two issues, it is definitely not so-called "drawing and pulling" to take care of personal relationships.</p>

<h3>To Solve the Far East Problem, the United States and the Soviet Union Should First Withdraw Their Troops. "The US Herald" Published a Commentary</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] The "The US Herald" said in today's editorial: "We have already seen Moscow-style 'coalition governments' in places like Poland and Yugoslavia, and we do not want to see such a coalition government again. The United States and the Soviet Union should have a necessary agreement in the Far East, but they need to withdraw their troops from the United States and the Soviet Union from the liberated areas of Korea, Manchuria, and China. If this is the case, the people of those countries will be able to freely organize their own governments according to their own needs and aspirations. This is the provision of the Atlantic Charter, and it was recognized by Russia in Tehran and Yalta."</p>
<p>The author concluded: "For the United States and the Soviet Union, this is the only truly democratic way to solve the Far East problem."</p>
<h3>Serious Disaster in Anhui</h3>

<h3>Zhang Shaowu, Commander of the Communist Central China Region, Declares Defection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Zhang Shaowu, commander and political commissar of the Huaiyang Column of the Communist Central China Region, and his chief of staff, Liu Weifeng, led their troops to defect on the 22nd of last month and declared their separation from the Chinese Communist Party on the 29th, obeying the government and serving the country. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Since the Japanese invaders invaded China, the whole country was in turmoil. At that time, Shaowu was driven by conscience and participated in the anti-Japanese war effort in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, hoping to win glory for the nation. In the 27th year, the CCP used the united front as a slogan to strive for the final victory. Shaowu and others aimed to resist Japan, and the Communist Party also used the Anti-Japanese Resistance as its slogan, so they did not ask about the future and resolutely joined the CCP organization, hoping to strengthen our anti-Japanese camp. Unexpectedly, for eight years, the CCP repeatedly lied and used killings, and China has been devastated for several years after Japan's surrender. How can we bear to meet each other with weapons and only harm the people? If the CCP values the country and the nation, it should respect the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and work together harmoniously to build the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and then China can move towards unity and join the ranks of the powerful. Because every country, without government leadership, loses its center and the whole country will fall into chaos. Even if the CCP and the government have political disagreements, they should discuss them frankly. For a year, the government has endured patiently and convened peace talks, but the CCP has repeatedly overturned the previous case for excuses, creating a situation that cannot be resolved. The CCP is determined to undermine peace and fight among themselves, and its policy of murder and terror, and the launching of class struggle, have long been abhorred by Shaowu and others. In the future, it will abandon the Chinese people, launch civil wars, harm the country and the people, and destroy unity. Shaowu only knows to love the country, regardless of party and personal interests, and it is difficult to stay on the wrong path. Therefore, with the approval of Deputy Director Li, the Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative District, stationed in Huaiyin, we are allowed to be lenient. On the 22nd of January of the 36th year, we led more than a thousand officers and soldiers of this unit to defect, arrived in Yanghuaji, Suqian, and waited for orders, serving the country. From this day on, we break away from the Chinese Communist Party, obey the government's leadership, and hope that the armed comrades who have been deceived by the CCP will return as soon as possible so that the country can achieve peace and the nation can be fortunate. Sincerely declare, I hope you will consider it. Former Commander and Political Commissar of the Huaiyang Column of the Communist Central China Region, Zhang Shaowu, Chief of Staff Liu Weifeng (January 29th). (printed)."</p>
<h3>Fifth Army Participates in the Battle of Shanghai, Commander Twice Commended by Telegram, General Zhang Zhizhong Answers Reporter's Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] General Zhang Zhizhong, in response to a reporter's request on the 31st, answered the following questions: (Question) According to Shanghai newspaper reports, before holding the "January 28th" commemoration, General Zhang was invited to Shanghai to participate. Is this true? (Answer) On the morning of the 27th, I received a telegram from Mr. Huang Yanpei, which roughly stated, "The Shanghai community is holding the 'January 28th' Commemoration Meeting, and my colleagues have unanimously entrusted me to invite you to attend and give guidance. I am sending this telegram to respectfully request your early arrival," etc. However, because I had an important appointment on that day, I was unable to attend, and I am very sorry. I sent a reply telegram to Mr. Huang to express my gratitude. (Question) On the 29th, the Shanghai Wenhui News reported that during the "January 28th" commemoration meeting, someone said in a speech: "At that time, although the Fifth Army was ordered to ostensibly provide support, in reality it was monitoring, but the officers and soldiers were moved and resolutely participated in the war." General Zhang, as the commander of the Fifth Army at that time, what are your thoughts on this statement? (Answer) This point is absolutely inconsistent with the facts. I was ordered to purely assist the 19th Route Army in the war. The Supreme Commander at that time sent two telegrams, Xianxu and Qiaoxi, to instruct and encourage morale, with earnest words. The officers and soldiers were extremely moved, and the Fifth Army's bravery in battle, its heavy sacrifices, and its sincerity in uniting with friendly forces are all facts that are well known to both Chinese and foreign people. (Question) Regarding the withdrawal from the Military Three-Person Group and the Peiping Military Mediation Executive, General Zhang was the government representative in the Three-Person Group. What are your opinions on this? (Answer) I once represented the government and successively signed the plans for the restoration of transportation, reorganization, and unified compilation, as well as the Northeast Armistice Agreement, etc. Now they have all vanished, and I cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. The government has already issued a statement on this matter, and I have no other opinions. (Question) It is said that Ambassador Petrov visited General Zhang on the 27th for a long conversation. I wonder what the content of the conversation was? (Answer) The Soviet Ambassador came to meet me for a friendly visit only. The conversations were all broad and casual and did not involve any specific issues. (Question) What are General Zhang's recent activities? (Answer) I originally planned to return to my hometown at the end of the old lunar year to sweep the tombs, but I was subsequently ordered to prepare to go to Yan'an, so I canceled it. Now that the trip to Yan'an has been "blocked," I still plan to take a few days off after finishing my official duties and go back to Chaoxian County to take a look before returning to Xinjiang. The reporter then asked General Zhang's secretary to provide the original texts of the two telegrams, Xianxu and Qiaoyou, sent by Chairman Chiang during the "January 28th" Battle of Shanghai to General Zhang. The reporter believes that these are valuable historical documents and has specially transcribed them below: Xianxu Telegram (Titles omitted): Today, your brothers have decided to resist to the end in your original positions. Your spirit of struggle is extremely commendable. I hope that you brothers will work hard to unite and win glory for our Party and country... I hope that you will work together with comrades Chiang and Cai of the 19th Route Army, unite and struggle, and obey the orders of General Commander Chiang in a thorough and practical manner, without the slightest estrangement. If we do not demonstrate the spirit of national revolution here and resolve to sacrifice, when should we wait? Convey this meaning to all officers and soldiers. Qiaoyou Telegram (Titles omitted): Resisting Japan is related to the survival of the nation and is by no means a matter of the honor or disgrace of an individual or a certain unit. All my officers and soldiers in the front should thoroughly understand this meaning. Therefore, the honor of the 19th Route Army is the honor of the entire National Revolutionary Army. There is absolutely no distinction between each other's honor and disgrace. This time, the Fifth Army has joined the battle line. If it can consistently fight in the name of the 19th Route Army, it will further demonstrate the strength of our National Revolutionary Army's combat power, sharing life and death together. How can there be any consideration of honor or disgrace? Please earnestly convey this meaning to all officers and soldiers of the Fifth Army, and be sure to unite and struggle with my 19th Route Army. No sacrifice should be spared to complete the mission of the revolution.</p>

<h3>Prisoners Granted Amnesty, National Total Estimated at 70,000 to 80,000, Those Involved in the Assassination of Wang Jingwei May Be Released</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, recently told reporters: The total number of prisoners in the country is estimated to be about 220,000. Based on the assumption that one-third of them will be released this time, there will be 70,000 to 80,000 people. The Ministry of Judicial Administration previously issued a general order to courts across the country to actively prepare for the protection of released prisoners based on the existing precedents. Our country also has precedents for the proper handling of released prisoners. In the 31st year of the Republic, when I inspected Jian'ou, what I saw was quite well done. Since the implementation of the amnesty this year, the handling of post-release matters varies from place to place. In principle, courts cooperate with charitable organizations for relief, or request assistance from the Post-War Relief Administration. The methods include issuing winter clothing or providing travel expenses, or introducing job opportunities. In addition, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has paid close attention to promoting prison labor in courts across the country in recent years, urging courts across the country to mobilize prisoners to work, striving to cultivate work habits, and adopting bonus methods to give prisoners income. On the one hand, this enables prisoners to have appropriate labor, and on the other hand, it can also cultivate skills so that they do not have to rely on relief after being released.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The situation of the implementation of the amnesty in various places: (1) Wuchang: Eighty-eight people have been released, and one hundred and seventy-one people who have already been determined and whose cases have not yet been tried have also been pardoned according to law. (2) Xi'an: The first batch of two hundred and eight pardoned prisoners in Shaanxi were released, and the military amnesty cases are being processed. (3) Beiping: The Ping Court is clearing pardoned prisoners. Except for criminals whose sentences are reduced, who are still waiting for instructions from the Ministry, one thousand three hundred and forty-one people will be released in ten days. (4) Zhengzhou: Since the 30th of last month, more than forty people have been released. (5) Nanchang: On January 30th and February 1st, a total of more than twenty prisoners were pardoned. (6) Kunming: The Kunming District Court released fifty-eight criminals who met the amnesty requirements today, and three hundred and eighty cases of acquittal judgments have been completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 2nd] Yu Likui and He Biguang, who assassinated Wang Jingwei in Beijing before the War of Resistance, were transferred to Guizhou for trial after the war. They were originally sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each. The Guizhou Higher Court Prosecutor's Office appealed to the Supreme Court requesting another sentence. However, the judgment has not yet been received. Now that the state is implementing a general amnesty, it is learned that if the Supreme Court upholds the original sentence, it can be reduced to six years according to the amnesty order. If they are sentenced to life imprisonment, it will also be reduced to ten years. Moreover, Yu and He have been imprisoned for more than ten years, so no matter which of the above alternative sentences is given, they can be released immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 2nd] The two courts, Higher and District, here are rushing to handle amnesty cases. Although it is Sunday on the 2nd, they are not taking a holiday. More than ninety people have been pardoned in the past three days. Before being released, they all swore to start anew.</p>
<h3>Government Remits 400 Million Yuan for Emergency Relief to Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, French Side Principally Agrees to Compensation for Damages</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Recently, the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly serious, and the people of the country are quite concerned about the measures to protect overseas Chinese. A reporter specifically inquired with relevant government departments and was informed of the government's recent handling of this matter as follows: (1) Remittance for Relief: Two weeks ago, the government allocated and remitted 3 million Vietnamese currency (equivalent to 400 million National currency), which was handed over to our Consul General Yuan in Hanoi to handle emergency relief. The French side also voluntarily donated 5 million francs. (2) Evacuation of Overseas Chinese: Regarding the areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated, our side has proposed to the French and Vietnamese sides to establish safe zones. The French side has expressed agreement in principle. However, because the war situation is constantly changing, and the Viet Minh forces in the overseas Chinese area of Hanoi insist on holding on, although Consul General Yuan has ventured into the area eight times and actively negotiated with the Vietnamese side, there have been no results. As a last resort, we have started to evacuate the overseas Chinese first, and with the consent of the French side, houses have been vacated in the French area for accommodation. As of January 25, more than 2,000 of our overseas Chinese have been evacuated, and we are still continuing negotiations for evacuation. Yesterday, we reiterated to the French Embassy a solemn request that they should not attack the area before the overseas Chinese have been completely evacuated. (3) Supply of Food: Our side is planning to charter planes to fly from Nanning or Kunming to Hanoi or Haiphong to transport food and medicine. On the return trip, the elderly, weak, women, and children among the overseas Chinese will be evacuated in batches. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for dispatching planes, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is responsible for purchasing food and medicine, and has negotiated with the French side to allow our planes to enter and land. At the same time, as a result of our negotiations with the French side, they have issued some rice, vegetables, and salted fish rations to our overseas Chinese. (4) Damage Investigation: The losses of the overseas Chinese in this Vietnam war are very heavy. We have repeatedly requested compensation from the French side. The French side has agreed in principle, and we have instructed our consulate general in Hanoi to handle the registration and investigation of damages. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Xiao Jinfang as the consul in Haiphong and ordered him to take office as soon as possible to quickly handle the investigation of overseas Chinese in Haiphong. (5) Dispatch Personnel for Consolation and Investigation: The government has considered this several times, but because the war situation in Vietnam is very chaotic and the cities are in a state of isolation, it is difficult to visit all places even if personnel are sent. However, personnel will still be sent when necessary.</p>

<h3>Founder of the Peace Movement Talks About the Current Situation in Writing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The founder of the peace movement recently issued a written statement on the current situation as follows:</p>
<p>The goal of our launching this movement is to truly lament the current warfare, which internally is enough to undermine the foundation of the country and externally is enough to invite foreign insults. Especially with the opening of the Japanese peace conference, if China cannot appear on the international stage with a state of peaceful unification, then the achievements of eight years of arduous struggle may be destroyed at once. I believe that the reason why the scourge of war has lasted for so long today is that, on the one hand, the habit of engaging in political struggles by force still exists, and on the other hand, the atmosphere of partisanship encourages the war. We believe that the less encouragement there is for prejudice, the sooner the war will end. Therefore, when launching this movement, we adhere to two principles: one is the spirit of impartiality beyond party lines, and the other is the pure spirit of no political intentions. Industrialists, businessmen, and freelancers have no need for bias or political intentions, and their desire for peace is also the most urgent. Therefore, they are the main participants. We firmly believe that once the fair opinions of the whole country are concentrated, there will be an incomparably great moral force, which is the content contained in our four covenants (see various newspapers on January 31). Since the 126 Declaration was issued, various parties have expressed attention, which is a common desire for peace, and it is also because our impartiality is sufficient for the world to see. Since the 126 Declaration was issued, we have received widespread sympathy, but there are also those who have given us advice, which can be divided into five categories: One said that we should form an organization to become a new third party. We can answer that, the word "third party" is still a polite term. We are citizens of the country, that is, the masters, and there is no such thing as a third party. Second, it is said that we should contact both parties and participate in mediation. We can also answer that if both parties can reopen negotiations, we will adopt a welcoming and observant attitude, but we have no intention of getting involved in the vortex. Our call for peace is more of a urging than a requesting attitude, which is the attitude that modern citizens should have. The third and fourth arguments either suggest that we should help A against B, or that we should help B against A. We can further answer that these are all measures to stop boiling water by adding more cold water, and they must be absolutely avoided. Because no matter which side is favored, it is enough to encourage war and is not conducive to peace. Finally, there are those who advise us to be clear about right and wrong. Now that the war is in full swing, tracing the past will only make the problem more and more divergent. What the people want is to realize peaceful, unified, and democratic as soon as possible. This is why we do not want to evaluate the various things before 126. Today, how is right and wrong? It can be said that peace is right and not peace is "wrong."</p>
<p>We are determined to continue to call for peace in the spirit of the 126 Declaration and the Four Covenants until peace is realized. No matter what the war situation is like, and whatever the reasons for the war are, what we hope for is only an immediate ceasefire anytime and anywhere to achieve peaceful unification and realize democracy. We firmly believe that if the people of the whole country unanimously take the position of masters and exert the power of public opinion, they will be able to promote peace at an early date. Currently, we are widely soliciting signatures from all walks of life to join the initiative. We welcome people of any profession who are not bound by partisan bias. In the future, we will carry out extensive calls for peace and signatures throughout the country, and representatives will be nominated to go to major cities such as Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, etc., to contact local industrialists, businessmen, and other people who are outside of partisan biases, and jointly engage in this movement, hoping to use the power of the public opinion of the entire organization to end the self-destructive civil war. Finally, we call on the people of the country to pay attention to a serious fact: Since the United States has withdrawn from its position as a mediator, the responsibility for the people to solve their own national affairs before the conference on the Japan issue has become even greater. We deeply regret that the mediation of the United States has failed. Today, the domestic problem lies in the people of the country solving it themselves, which has been recognized by all parties. This is also the meaning of our launching this movement. We firmly believe that when this spirit of a fair peace movement penetrates the hearts of the people throughout the country, it will be the day when peace is realized. The people must know that they are the masters of the country, and firmly believe that public opinion is the most irresistible force. They must confirm that promoting peaceful unification and democracy is the common path to self-salvation and national salvation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 2nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce and the 59 commercial associations of Zhenjiang, believing that there can be no peace without stopping the war and no way to save the country without peace, telegraphed the whole country on the 2nd, calling for peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd] The Kowloon Chamber of Commerce and 14 other groups recently telegraphed the whole country, supporting the Shanghai community's declaration calling for peace.</p>
<h3>Chennault Flies to Guilin, Large Quantities of Relief Supplies Shipped Simultaneously, Executive Headquarters Air Transport Main Station to Be Established in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] Flying Tiger General Chennault flew to Guilin from Guangzhou on a giant C-45 aircraft at 9:00 am on the 2nd. This was the first flight after the establishment of the Executive Headquarters Air Transport Brigade, carrying 9,000 pounds of relief medicine and other supplies. Before taking off, Chennault told reporters at Tianhe Airport here: During the war, he felt that post-war construction in China must solve the transportation problem. Only by restoring transportation can various construction and relief efforts be carried out. His ideal has been realized with the help of various Chinese officials. The purpose of establishing the Air Transport Brigade is to supply all relief materials to the rear and to pay special attention to safety, because many of the flight personnel are from the 14th Air Force, who are all wealthy and experienced, while increasing air transport. Chennault stated that he came to Guangzhou in 1937 to train the Chinese Air Force. After inspecting, he was unable to come again due to the war, but he always missed Guangzhou. After the city fell, he led a team to bomb it, so he only bombed military areas and never bombed residential areas or injured civilians. He was very happy to see that the urban area was generally intact this time, not as badly damaged as London, Paris, and other places. Later, when reporters asked whether the Air Transport Brigade was preparing to undertake other entrusted transportation and commercial transportation, Chennault said no. Chennault also denied the news that a commercial transportation company from Honolulu to Tokyo was organized by Flying Tiger personnel. According to Zhang Zixuan, director of the brigade's Guangzhou area, the brigade currently has five aircraft capable of carrying three tons each, and fourteen aircraft capable of carrying six tons each will arrive here. They are all the best aircraft from Honolulu. In the future, the main air transport station will be established in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] General Chennault and his party of five arrived here by plane from Guangzhou at 2:00 pm on the 2nd. The provincial government hosted a banquet in the evening. Chennault is scheduled to return to Guangzhou by the original plane on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Talks in Taiwan, Building the Navy Cannot Be Delayed</h3>
<p>Training Institution to Be Established in Zuoying</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] Naval Acting Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Gui Yongqing met with reporters on the 2nd and stated: "Now is the best time for our country to develop the navy. Recalling the Sino-Japanese War, the fate of the country was determined by a naval battle of several hours, which illustrates the importance of the navy and that the establishment of a new navy cannot be delayed. As far as Taiwan is concerned, a history of Taiwan is a history of coastal defense. Zheng Chenggong's recovery of Taiwan and the Qing government's loss of Taiwan, the key to success or failure, lies in the superiority or inferiority of naval power. Taiwan's geographical and climatic conditions are the best naval base. A naval training institution will be established soon. The location will be selected in Zuoying to recruit naval cadets, and we especially hope that young people from Taiwan Province will participate enthusiastically." Gui also stated: "The current work focuses on the following four things: sorting out the received equipment, training talents, establishing systems, and eliminating factionalism." Speaker Chen Yiguan also invited former Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng and Gui to Caoshan, a scenic spot in the suburbs of Taipei, on the 2nd to spend a Sunday holiday together. They returned late at dusk.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] The Tanggu New Port thirteen-year plan has begun to be promoted. The project cost is a total of 115 billion yuan, which has been approved, and the central government has promised to allocate it in installments.

After the completion of the three-year plan, not only will the above-mentioned losses be avoided, but the New Port can also have a surplus of 5 billion yuan per year.</p>
<h3>Building the Yangtze River Dam and Power Plant: Mr. Bash Promotes US to Provide Electrical Equipment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st dispatch] Mr. Bash, who previously proposed the Chinese government's initial plan in 1944 to build a massive dam and hydroelectric plant on the Yangtze River at Yichang, today urged the United States to provide all necessary electrical equipment needed in the plan to strengthen China. Mr. Bash, now in charge of economic affairs for the Gladch Trading Company, said: "The entire investment of the United States can be repaid within fifteen years, because fertilizer produced in Yichang and antimony, which the United States lacks, can both be imported from China." Mr. Bash also said that he is still researching large-scale flood control and Yellow River water management plans. "If this plan is adopted, the world's largest reclamation project can emerge at the lowest appropriate cost, which is what I enjoy doing." Mr. Bash's Yangtze River hydroelectric plan was submitted to the Chongqing government in June and November 1944, but has not yet been announced. Mr. Bash continued, "This plan is also extremely important politically. Its implementation can stabilize China's political and economic situation, because as the Chinese government improves the economic status of farmers in densely populated areas, the people can feel that the government truly cares about and helps them. In this way, the government can also obtain the greatest support. If China's economy can be properly developed, it can be as powerful as the United States within twenty years."</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Bird's-Eye View of the Palestine Problem</h3>
<p>The Palestine problem, which has been the most difficult issue for Britain after the war, has finally developed to the most serious stage after two full years of turmoil, terror, and bloodshed. The atrocities of Jewish terrorists are intensifying. Last July, the British military headquarters in Jerusalem, the King David Hotel, was bombed by the Jewish underground organization Irgun. In late January of this year, two British expatriates, Judge Winterton and Major Collins, were kidnapped by Jewish terrorists. All British expatriates in Palestine felt threatened and lived in constant fear, which prompted British High Commissioner General Cunningham to take emergency security measures, on the one hand, imposing curfews and security measures in Jewish cities, and on the other hand, sentencing Galona, the Jew who attacked the headquarters, to death. This made the mood of the Jews even more tense, and acts of terrorism were seen everywhere, almost turning this holy land into a hell of terror. Therefore, in order to protect the lives and property of expatriates, the British government ordered British women and children to withdraw to their home country on the 31st of last month, and at the same time ordered government personnel to enter safe areas. After Britain took this emergency security measure, the attention of the whole world was focused on this Palestine problem.</p>
<p>Palestine was originally a British mandate after World War I, but how should the Jewish-Arab dispute in Palestine be arranged after World War II? In Britain's view, of course, this is also a very serious problem. At first, Britain pulled in the United States and jointly organized a joint investigation team to conduct on-the-spot investigations in Palestine. As a result, a report was issued suggesting that 100,000 Jews be transferred to Palestine first. However, in Palestine, Jews and Arabs are almost two incompatible ethnic groups because of racial discrimination and economic competition. The British and American proposal to transfer 100,000 Jews to Palestine first will naturally arouse the opposition of the Arabs. The Arabs have lived in Palestine for hundreds of years and have long regarded Palestine as their own place. How can they tolerate the entry of a large number of foreigners? What's more, Jews are superior to Arabs in terms of knowledge and wealth?</p>
<p>The policy adopted by Britain towards Palestine is inherently contradictory. On the one hand, Britain approves of Jews moving to Palestine, and on the other hand, it advocates supporting the unified movement of the Arab nation. In 1943, when Eden was Foreign Secretary, he declared that Britain was willing to promote the establishment of the Arab League. However, the result of Britain's adoption of this contradictory policy aroused dissatisfaction from both Jews and Arabs, which is what we call "not pleasing either side." Therefore, the British Colonial Office drafted two plans. The first plan was to ask the United States to station troops in Palestine to protect Jews entering the country; the second plan was to divide Palestine into two federations, which is what we call the Jewish-Arab partition. Regarding the former, asking the United States to station troops in Palestine is tantamount to asking the United States to pull chestnuts out of the fire. President Truman can see the gains and losses of this matter clearly. Britain's wishful thinking will naturally not be realized. As for the latter, to divide Palestine into two federations, Britain should first obtain the consent of the Arabs and Jews to implement this plan. Therefore, the British Colonial Office decided to hold a Palestine round table conference in London on September 9 last year, but on the day the conference opened, the Arab representatives first stated: "Palestine should belong to us; Palestine has nothing to do with the Jews. The Jewish refugee problem needs multilateral cooperation to solve." As for the Jews, what they want is to restore their country; what they hope for is independence. They are also not interested in Britain's partition plan, so the Jews have never sent representatives to attend. The London Conference opened in a dim atmosphere and fell into a state of stagnation in less than ten days.</p>
<p>When Britain could not solve the Palestine problem, President Truman suddenly issued a statement assisting the Jews, advocating that Jewish refugees should be transferred to Palestine in large numbers immediately, and supporting the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. He expressed disagreement with Britain's plan to implement the Jewish-Arab partition. Therefore, the Palestine problem became more complicated and more subtle; Britain's partition plan was not only dissatisfied by both Jews and Arabs, but also opposed by the United States. The divergence in the steps of Britain and the United States only made Britain's position more difficult and more fragile. Later, the British Colonial Office and the Foreign Office still made great efforts, hoping that this problem could be resolved satisfactorily; but they also knew that this problem was thorny and there was little chance of a satisfactory solution, so it was decided to make a final decision on this matter at the Palestine Conference at the end of January this year. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin's planned plan, if the Palestine Conference fails again, Britain plans to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for handling.</p>
<p>Now the London Round Table Conference has been reopened as scheduled. Not only is there no hope for a thorough solution to the Palestine problem, but also the situation in Palestine is even more serious than before, which has forced the British government to order the withdrawal of women and children; it is expected that the Palestine problem, in addition to being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by Britain until the fall, there is really no second way to find. This is the depression of British diplomacy after the war, and it is also the tragedy of the present era.</p>

<h3>Paratroopers Arrive in Jintan: Strengthening the Suppression in the Maoshan Area: Joint Defense and Suppression Begins on the Border of Xicheng</h3>

(2) The division, brigade, and regimental commanders in the townships and cities recovered by the national army should immediately select one officer with the strongest ability and four soldiers from each company and assign them to work in the political department or the regimental office. (3) The assistance in promoting local autonomy in the Pacification Zone is divided into three steps to complete. The first step is one month, the second step is two months, and the third step is three months. The key points of the first step are to restore local institutions at all levels, establish local power, investigate and organize the Baojia system, and organize and train local self-defense forces. The second step is to prohibit the circulation of illegally issued currencies, implement the joint guarantee and joint liability system, and assist in the supply of food for the people and military rations, etc. The third step is to promote cooperative enterprises, run production enterprises, and other work that must be assisted in promoting local autonomy.</p>

<h3>Xiangshan County Party Headquarters: Secretary-General Accused</h3>

<p>[This newspaper, Ningbo dispatch] Zhou Kaixuan, the current Secretary-General of the Xiangshan County Party Headquarters, served as the Xiangdong District Mayor of Xiangshan in 1943. Under the pretext of paying the Anti-Japanese War donation, he extorted 20,000 yuan from the wealthy household Huang Xianglin. At that time, Huang Xianglin avoided seeing him. Zhou Kaixuan did not achieve his purpose, so he sent a team to search the house again in October of the same year. Huang Xianglin's mother was intimidated and knew that it was difficult to escape, so she asked You Chuanshan Yu to intercede with Zhou. If she paid, in April 1944, Zhou Kaiyi recognized that the amount of the donation was too small and detained Huang Xianglin's mother, Qian, his wife, Xu, and his younger brother, Xianfu, in the district office for two days and nights. He still asked You Chuanshan Yu to intercede on his behalf and paid another 4,000 yuan before they were released. After the restoration, Huang Xianglin refused to accept the humiliation and narrated the situation in detail and asked the Chief Prosecutor's Office of the Third Branch of the High Court in this port to investigate.

<h3>Bandits in the Hubei-Anhui Border Region Executed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei News] Since the Anhui provincial government moved from Lihuang to Hefei in the winter of the year before last, banditry has risen in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, including the counties of Shangcheng, Gushi, Huoqiu, and Lihuang. Although the Second District Commissioner Wu Yingzhou repeatedly dispatched troops to search and suppress them last year, the bandits left when the soldiers came, and they were never completely eliminated. As winter approached, bandit activity became more rampant. The Wuhan Headquarters (武漢行轅) sent Yang Chuiye, Deputy Commander of the Ninth Security District of Hubei, with a regiment of troops, to set up a bandit suppression command post in Jizhen, an important town between Lihuang and Huoqiu in Anhui province. Troops were dispatched to search and suppress the bandits in different directions. At the end of the lunar year last year, Wan Shucheng, the major bandit who looted Yeji on the 4th of last month, and Hu Chuanyou, Wang Yingti, Liu Weiyuan, Zhang Yangshan (nicknamed Zhang Tianshi), a retired lieutenant platoon leader named Gao Mingcai, and more than 40 other well-known bandits who had not been captured for many years, were arrested, interrogated, and executed. The Shangcheng, Gushi, Huoqiu, and Lihuang counties are now undergoing a major crackdown on banditry, checking household registrations, and organizing people's self-defense teams to protect the local area and eliminate the source of bandits.</p>

<h3>UNRRA's Su-Ning Sub-Group to End in June This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] The UNRRA organization in China is scheduled to end in June this year. The reporter visited Mr. Buxis, the spokesperson of the UNRRA Su-Ning Sub-Group, on the 1st to inquire about the details.

All relief matters are carried out by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration (行總). Mr. Buxis expressed his deep regret for the economic depression of various industries in this city and inquired in detail about the price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>The Spring Festival Quietly Passes; Zhenjiang's Industries Not Yet Fully Operational</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] The Spring Festival has quietly passed in the wind and snow, but the various industries have still been slow to fully start operations. The reporter believes that this matter is of great concern to all parties, and specially visited a giant in the financial world of this city to inquire whether there are any relief measures. According to him, this phenomenon is not only the case in Zhenjiang, but also in other places. Although the head office of the four joint official banks has ordered to relax industrial and commercial loans to seek relief, due to the position of each bank itself, it can only operate general loans, that is, collateral loans. Jiangsu Bank once did real estate mortgage loans, but because the bank's funds were short, it only released 60 to 70 million yuan and then stopped. Although the Central Farmer's Bank is also currently engaged in construction loan business, the head office has ordered to do less, so the restrictions are quite strict. As for the Central Bank, as the bank's bank, its lending targets seem to be only banks, so it can't help. Fortunately, there has been no major volatility in the financial market recently. If the business community can use its abilities well, its future will naturally be better.</p>

<h3>Requesting the Exhibition of Cultural Relics to Be Moved and Opened Elsewhere</h3>
<p>This exhibition of anti-Japanese war cultural relics at the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road is of great significance, and various newspapers have given it high praise. I did not have time to visit it because I was preparing for a big exam, and the trams on the 1 and 2 routes were very crowded. It is very inconvenient for me, who lives in the southern district, to brave such great difficulties to visit the exhibition in the northern district. I propose that the cultural relics exhibition be moved to the central district for several days, such as the YMCA (八仙橋) and the Great New Company, so that we young people can get a glimpse of the difficult process of the Anti-Japanese War and understand the greatness of the Anti-Japanese War and the difficulty of national struggle. (Yu Guan'ao) 1, 20</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Academic Level Public Examinations</h3>
<p>After the war, all industries are in urgent need of construction, especially in education, which requires extra effort. Although the education authorities have announced tuition limits, it is very difficult to find a school that meets those limits. Moreover, poor children have few opportunities to enter formal schools. However, the youth who study hard on their own are hit with unknown numbers of blows to their courage to study because they do not have the qualification certificates to obtain.</p>
<p>To help these people who are eager to learn reach their goals and make them all outstanding citizens, the education authorities really have a responsibility to supervise and encourage them. How can this task be completed? That is to hold academic level public examinations. The holding of academic level public examinations is for the education authorities to send personnel to examine whether the knowledge of those who study on their own is qualified, and those who pass will be given an academic level certificate, which has the same qualifications as an equivalent formal school. In the future, whether it is further education or service, it can be used as a formal certificate. The exam should of course be strict to test their true talent and make them work hard to improve. What needs to be held urgently now are three types of academic level public examinations: junior high school, high school, and university. The number of exams can be set as: once a year, or once every two years. In this way, those who study on their own or research on their own can have interest and a way out. In addition, it can also encourage students in formal schools to study hard and improve. Otherwise, their knowledge will also be distrusted. People who apply to take the exam, regardless of gender, age, or age, can take the exam. This can improve the level of national education and strengthen the border of cultural defense.

<h3>British in the Middle East Conduct Secret Activities; Outside, Jordan Deploys Troops to the Syrian Border; Attempting to Realize the "Greater Syria" Plan; In Order to Break the Stalemate of the Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press Cairo, 1st] The Arabic-language "Yom" weekly reported today that outer Jordanian troops are currently concentrated on the Syrian border, and King Abdullah is planning to enter Syria by force. Arab figures here did not express surprise at this, saying that if this is true, there are two messages: (1) Abdullah wants to annex Syria in order to realize his ambition to establish "Greater Syria." (2) In order to facilitate the resolution of the Palestine stalemate, the Arab part of Palestine will be incorporated into Greater Syria, and a smaller Jewish Palestine will be established. The war also said that outer Jordan will generally create some kind of incident as an excuse to enter Syria. British agents have secretly encouraged Abdullah, with a long-term vision of using him to solve the Palestinian problem.</p>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] According to unconfirmed reports, Outer Jordanian King Abdullah has agreed to accept as many British women and children as possible who have been evacuated from Palestine to Outer Jordan.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] Parties concerned say that British women, children, and non-essential civilians evacuated from Palestine will be temporarily placed in various places in the Near East and Middle East, such as Cyprus, Sudan, the Suez Canal Zone, Kenya, and South and East Africa.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York, 1st] American writer and Vice Chairman of the Free Palestine League Brown Field said today that the British evacuation of women and children from Palestine is reminiscent of Britain launching a real war against the Jewish people. Britain has already made big mistakes in Ireland and India, and now it is repeating them in Palestine. It is a mistake to make again and again, which is regrettable. It must be known that the will of the people is irresistible. It is also wrong for the Zionist movement to cooperate with the British to jointly suppress the Palestinian Jewish resistance movement.</p>
<h3>British Garrison in Palestine Deploys Iron Net, as if Facing a Great Enemy; Jewish Terrorist Group Expresses Determination to Fight</h3>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] Rumors here say that Gruner, the Jewish underground member sentenced to death, will be hanged next Tuesday. Today, British troops braved the rain to deploy new barbed wire everywhere, strengthening defenses, and forming patrols with the police, each team consisting of eight to ten people. Some Jewish areas in Jerusalem are divided into half-mile square enclosures by heavy barbed wire. According to reliable sources, the Palestinian government has notified Jewish community leaders that if Gruner is executed, a 24-hour curfew will be imposed in Palestine. If terrorist groups riot, martial law will be implemented in certain areas. Gruner is currently in a Jerusalem prison, and the appeal he drafted has not yet been signed. Twenty houses in the Katamon area of Jerusalem are surrounded by double-layered barbed wire, mainly for government officials ordered to move into the secure zone. Military circles held an emergency meeting, apparently to discuss maintaining public order. The Palestinian government yesterday ordered all British women and children to evacuate by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 1st] Amid the active preparations for the evacuation of British women and children, leaflets and bombs from the Irgun party were found in Tel Aviv, claiming that the party will continue its fight with the British. The evacuation of 2,000 British families is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, when evacuees will be transported by land and air to port for embarkation. Senior British land and air force officers in Palestine, as well as the highest police authorities, held a highly confidential meeting lasting 45 minutes at the British motor headquarters in Jerusalem today. The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency also held an emergency meeting. General Barker, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces, left Jerusalem for Haifa tonight. Meanwhile, the deadline for the postponed execution of Jewish terrorist Gruner will expire on Sunday, and retaliatory actions by terrorists are expected to become active immediately after the execution.</p>
<h3>Palestine Problem: Partition Plan a Thing of the Past; Will Be Submitted to the United Nations for Handling</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 2nd] A Middle East correspondent for "World News" stated that the Palestine partition plan is a thing of the past, and the future of Palestine apparently lies solely in being handled by the United Nations. During last week's British-Arab delegation talks, Bevin did not express support for partition, saying that partition was not within the scope of the mandatory power. Any solution that goes beyond the scope of the mandate should be decided by the United Nations. Bevin believes that Morrison's federal plan is more logical, but it is difficult to force its implementation because both Arabs and Jews strongly oppose it. The Arab delegation still insists on the plan they proposed last October, which is to establish an Arab democratic state where Jews, who make up one-third of the residents, can enjoy full rights and one-third of the representation in the cabinet. During last week's talks, Bevin asked the Arab representatives to make further concessions, but the possibility of this happening is very small. Therefore, the Palestine issue will ultimately have to be submitted to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>US to Begin Broadcasting to the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>UN Investigation Team in Greece Holds Meeting; Chinese Representative Expresses Views</h3>
<p>Advocating for the Swift Completion of Assigned Mission</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] The United Nations Fact-Finding Committee held a meeting here this morning at 11 AM to discuss the current general situation and the methods to be adopted in fulfilling its duties. The meeting lasted for a considerable time and adjourned at 1:30 PM. During the meeting, the Chinese representative, Jin Jianshi, the country's ambassador to Belgium, delivered a speech, urging the Investigation Committee to proceed swiftly with its assigned mission, saying: "The work we must complete is extremely difficult, and world opinion is focused on this committee." The Investigation Committee finally unanimously agreed that delays would provoke criticism from all parties and reduce the influence of the United Nations. The committee also decided to begin hearing statements from the representatives of the four countries concerned on the 3rd of this month. The Albanian representative will be the first to present his country's views, followed by the Greek representative. According to the Greek representative, Karaos, he has notified the Investigation Committee that he will submit two documents on the border conflict.</p>
<h3>US Delegation to Moscow Conference Reaches 100 People; Britain and Soviet Union to Discuss Military Alliance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] The US State Department recently announced that the US delegation to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference will include 100 experts. The US government has notified the Soviet government of the size of the US delegation, which will be the most important delegation the United States has sent to an international conference since the war. In addition, 73 newspaper and radio reporters have requested permission from the State Department to accompany the delegation to Moscow for news coverage. The Soviet government is currently studying this matter. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican, and Senator Connally, a Democrat, will accompany Secretary of State Marshall to Moscow, but the authorities have not yet made a statement on this matter. In addition, Cohen, an advisor to the State Department, and Bohlen, an advisor on Soviet affairs, may also go to Moscow.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] The diplomatic correspondent for "World News" stated today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will inform Stalin next month that Britain welcomes concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union similar to the current British-American agreement. World News disclosed this article, saying that Bevin will secretly discuss this matter with Stalin at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and will explore the "weaknesses" in the current British-Soviet agreement that Stalin opposes. It is claimed that Bevin will solemnly declare at that time that neither Britain and the Soviet Union nor Britain and the United States can conclude treaties outside the framework of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Austin Drafts General Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Soviet Representative Disagrees</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] According to authoritative sources, the world general disarmament plan that the United States is preparing to submit to the Security Council has been blocked due to Soviet opposition. This plan was drafted by US Representative Austin in consultation with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, combining arms and atomic restrictions into one plan. It has been secretly discussed in advance with the representatives of the other ten countries on the Security Council. When Austin met with Soviet Representative Gromyko, Gromyko immediately expressed his opposition. It is not yet known whether the United States will make concessions or insist on all the main provisions of the plan. Austin will make a final decision after informally consulting with other representatives.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The general disarmament plan drafted by US Representative Austin includes three points: (1) The Security Council should establish an eleven-nation Disarmament Committee to make various recommendations. This committee will not discuss atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction; atomic weapons will continue to be handled by the current Atomic Energy Commission. (2) A drafting sub-group should be established to formulate special provisions for the Disarmament Committee to refer to. (3) The Security Council should begin considering the Atomic Energy Commission's first report at its next meeting.</p>
<p>Establish Consultation Committee</p>
<p>In addition, a "Information and Consultation Committee" will be formed by representatives of the four major powers and representatives of the countries concerned. This committee will work in parallel with the Foreign Ministers Conference, so that all other Allied countries will be informed of the development of preparations. For example, when discussing the issue of Germany's western borders, the committee should include representatives of the four major powers as well as representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. When discussing the eastern border, Poland and Czechoslovakia should naturally be listed as countries concerned. In the second stage, France advocated that all Allied countries should be allowed to consult various documents in the Foreign Ministers Conference related to the special interests of each country, and that all Allied countries should be allowed to attend the four Foreign Ministers' representatives meeting as observers for any point of discussion.</p>
<p>Maintain Contact</p>
<p>At the same time, during the second stage, the representatives of the four major powers may also appoint expert working groups, and other Allied countries may participate in these groups. The expert representatives of the four powers are completely equal. Therefore, when the third stage begins, all Allied countries will have already been informed of the initial discussions of the four powers, which is very different from the situation at the previous Paris Peace Conference when discussing the peace treaties with the five vassal states of Germany. In the fourth stage, the "Information and Consultation Committee" will begin to operate again to provide direct liaison between the Allies and the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers. Diplomatic observers here believe that France's procedural memorandum has corrected the shortcomings in the procedure of the Paris Peace Conference and is expected to win widespread sympathy.</p>
<p>Ruhr Plan</p>
<p>It is also learned that the French government's memorandum submitted to the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Paris today regarding the international control of the Ruhr region's industry is purely an economic document with a detailed plan for controlling Germany's major industries.</p>
<h3>France Proposes Procedural Issues for Drafting Peace Treaty with Germany</h3>
<p>Divided into Four Stages</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] The French memorandum on the preparatory procedure for the German peace treaty, submitted to the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers Conference, will be discussed at the Four Foreign Ministers Representatives Meeting next Tuesday. It is learned that the memorandum suggests that the preparation for the peace treaty should be divided into four stages: (1) The Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow in March; (2) The Foreign Ministers Representatives Meeting will submit the first draft of the German peace treaty based on the discussion results of the Moscow Conference; (3) A peace conference of 22 Allied countries will be convened to discuss the draft; (4) The Four Powers Conference will be convened again to complete the final peace treaty. In order to satisfy the desire of other Allied countries to participate in the early discussions of the peace treaty, the French memorandum suggests that a consultation mechanism should be established during the Moscow Conference, and the four foreign ministers may invite any Allied country to participate in major discussions.</p>
<h3>US Pacific Fleet to Hold Large-Scale Naval and Air Exercises; Deadlock in US-Philippine Base Negotiations May Be Broken</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, 2nd] Rear Admiral Mongal, Commander of the First Task Force of the US Pacific Fleet, announced today that the force will conduct exercises in the Central Pacific from the end of this month until the end of the month, with various types of ships and aircraft participating. The First Task Force was reorganized from the Fifth Fleet. This exercise will be larger in scale than the exercise held by the Fifth Fleet off the coast of California in December last year, and will have mobile supply and repair equipment participating in the naval and air exercises.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Department of the Army stated today that General Trusscott, Commanding General of the Army Ground Forces, departed today for Alaska to inspect the special forces testing winter equipment in the Arctic environment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 1st] Negotiations on the US-Philippine military base agreement have lasted for more than six weeks. Since US Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt suddenly proposed to the Philippine government that the US military could withdraw completely if it wished, it is now reported that the negotiations are nearing completion. Philippine President Roxas and Foreign Minister Quirino's immediate rejection of the US proposal has apparently broken the deadlock caused by the base location issue. Roxas reported to Congress this week that the United States is very willing to withdraw all troops, but at the same time solemnly declared that the United States believes it has a fundamental obligation to guarantee the security of the Philippines in accordance with the wishes of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy announced today that in preparation for "global three-dimensional warfare," mixed training will be used to unify the military thinking of US Army and Navy officers. It is claimed that 900 selected officers from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are studying together at senior military academies.</p>
<h3>Obstacle to European Industrial Revival: Coal Shortage is the Biggest Fatal Wound</h3>
<p>This article originally appeared in the "World Report Weekly" published in Washington, DC, and was written based on recent survey reports from London, Paris, Berlin, Washington, and other places. The conclusion of this article is that "the current coal shortage hinders the industrial production of Western Europe." Due to the lack of coal, railways, factories, power plants, and home industries are progressing slowly, and the restoration of war losses has been affected.</p>
<p>Western European coal production is still less than two-thirds of pre-war production. The most important supplement comes from the United States. US coal exports are stipulated to be two million tons per month, but often the amount of coal exported cannot reach this tonnage due to interruptions in production and shipping.</p>
<p>Last spring, the strike by US coal miners had a serious impact on Europe. Then, summer came and solved the problem. And now it is the severe winter season, and Western Europe urgently needs US coal production to drive machinery and stay warm. The current reduction in US coal production directly affects the revival of European industry.</p>
<p>Due to the strike of ship sailors, US coal production imported to Europe between September and October last year reached only half of what was expected. Since the cessation of the strike last spring, European security has gradually been guaranteed.</p>
<p>The importance of US coal exports to Western Europe can be expressed in the following statistics:</p>
<p>(Percentage of US coal supply to European countries out of their total coal consumption).</p>
<p>Italy 70%</p>
<p>Finland 60%</p>
<p>Norway 45%</p>
<p>Portugal 42%</p>
<p>Sweden 32%</p>
<p>Denmark 32%</p>
<p>Switzerland 25%</p>
<p>Netherlands 22%</p>
<p>France 13%</p>
<p>Belgium 8%</p>
<p>(Based on figures from August 1946)</p>
<p>Last August, when US coal exports complied with regulations, the total amount of coal in Europe that relied on the United States accounted for 21%.</p>
<p>The most dependent on the United States is Italy, which imports 70% of its total consumption from the United States. Several countries on the Scandinavian Peninsula (Norway, Sweden, etc.) also rely heavily on the United States. Before the US strike occurred, France and several of the Low Countries (Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium) imported more coal from the United States than from West Germany. Therefore, the delay in US mining also had a serious impact on the efficiency of coal imports into various countries.</p>
<p>The importance of US coal exports is enough to affect US production itself. In the first ten months of last year, the total amount of US imports into Western Europe was 15 million tons, which is equivalent to the weekly production in the United States.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Germany was originally the only coal exporting country in Western Europe. But now it has also stopped exporting to neighboring countries. The food shortage in the British-occupied zone of Germany is very serious. In recent weeks, the quantity of coal production has decreased sharply. As a result, several steel mills have closed, and the output of power plants has also decreased.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom decided to reduce exports from the Ruhr and Rhine areas to support industrial production. The reason for this proposal is that the United Kingdom intends to be self-sufficient. They are also quite troubled by the current internal political problems in Germany.</p>
<p>Coal production exports from the British zone of Germany will decrease from last July to this May by one-third of the export volume of 935,000 tons last September.</p>
<p>Within the French zone of Germany, including the Saar River basin, 125,000 tons are exported each month, most of which are used to supply mainland France. The output of each miner is higher than in the British zone. Its production rate is also close to pre-war standards.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>France is greatly affected by the difficulties in the Ruhr region. The reduction in electricity production in West Germany has affected France. Currently, half of Germany's industry is in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>What is directly affected is that Germany's total electricity consumption has decreased by at least 20%.</p>
<p>France's coal supply is in an unstable situation. French public utilities currently have only 17 days of coal reserves.</p>
<p>France's coal production this year is 50 million tons, exceeding the standard of 1938. Many war criminals are employed to work in the coal mines. But the efficiency is not very high. Because of the large number of people, it is enough to make up for the defects of low efficiency. However, the production volume is still far from meeting France's own needs.</p>
<p>Before World War II, France imported 28% of its total coal consumption. One-third of which was transported from Germany. Before the US sailors' strike, France imported US coal to supplement the supply, and the quantity reached 700,000 tons per month.</p>
<p>Because the import of coal from Germany has been interrupted, France is very eager to increase its purchases of US coal. Therefore, the stagnation of US transportation has seriously affected France's post-war recovery and the restoration of factories and transportation.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Most of the coal consumed in Italy is supplied by other countries. Italy's coal mining reaches 75% of the pre-war figure, but it is still only enough to offset 13% of consumption. The coal consumed in Italy is imported from the United States, and part of it is purchased with funds from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>If US coal exports are blocked and interrupted, Italy will undoubtedly face a collapse. Poland also supplies Italy with a small amount of coal. The United Kingdom may supply Italy with all its quantity, but without US coal and the funds to purchase coal, Italy will encounter a severe economic crisis and political chaos.</p>
<p>Belgium</p>
<p>Belgium can import a small part of coal from Germany, and if US coal cannot be imported, the impact will be much less than in other countries in Western Europe.</p>
<p>In August last year, about 8% of the coal consumed in Belgium was imported from the United States. The imported from other sources, mainly the Ruhr area, is 5%.</p>
<p>But the lack of coal still has a considerable impact on Belgian industry. The main thing is the mining of zinc ore, which can only be stopped without the burning of coal.</p>
<p>Netherlands</p>
<p>If the Netherlands does not have a US coal supply, its industry will be severely crippled. 22% of its total monthly coal consumption must be imported from the United Kingdom. Another 15% is supplied by Germany, but one-third of this will be cut off. The Netherlands' own coal mining is only slightly higher than half of the pre-war level.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for the Netherlands' industry to recover from the ruins ravaged by the war. The most serious problem at present is the lack of coal.</p>
<p>The countries on the Scandinavian Peninsula do not produce coal. Most of them obtain coal from the United Kingdom, West Germany, Poland, and the United States.</p>
<p>Compared with before the war, the United Kingdom's exports have declined. But Poland's exports are likely to increase.</p>
<p>The reduction in coal exports from West Germany and the United States is very serious for several Scandinavian countries, especially the steel industry in Sweden and Denmark, which will be severely hit.</p>
<p>Poland</p>
<p>Poland's progress in increasing coal production has been very rapid. Last year, it reached a record of 49 million tons. Even if the mining areas of Silesia province in eastern Germany are also included, it is still lower than the pre-war standard.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of Poland's coal production is seized by the Soviet Union, and most of the rest is exported to the Scandinavian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Now that there is an extreme shortage of coal in Western Europe, Poland has the best opportunity to control the Western European market. But because of the slow recovery of Soviet production, any large-scale exports from Poland cannot reach Western Europe.</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
<p>Before the war, the United Kingdom was the world's leading coal exporting country. The annual output reached 55 million tons. Compared with this year's figures, it is far behind.</p>
<p>Since the United Kingdom's production has fallen and domestic consumption has increased, coal exports are truly scarce and pitiful. The coal shortage in the United Kingdom is very tense. Therefore, several power plants have been forced to shut down to maintain the volume of coal. All industries must carefully plan their budgets for coal use, and the supply is 11% less than a year ago.</p>
<p>The entire Western Europe will suffer a sharp drop in production due to the lack of coal. If US coal mines cannot maintain an adequate and sufficient quantity to supply Western Europe, then the serious situation will turn into an emergency period. If the train transport can be kept from being disrupted, then industrial production will not be restricted. However, the coal used for taking turns is gradually becoming difficult to obtain.

<h3>Young Diet Members of Japan Progressive Party Advocate Establishing Coalition Cabinet: Liberal Party to Decide Attitude Today</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Young Diet members of the Japan Progressive Party are dissatisfied with the recent cabinet reshuffle by the Yoshida Cabinet, and the call for the speedy establishment of a coalition cabinet is growing. Nine Diet members from the party, including Arai, Kawasaki, Hosokawa, and Kanemitsu, visited Liberal Party executives Okubo and Ono today, urging them to quickly find a way to form a coalition cabinet. Okubo said that he was in favor of a coalition cabinet in principle, but the third attempt at a coalition cabinet must be fully considered, and the party's attitude would be decided after consulting with its official organs on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Japanese General Strike Declared Dissolved</p>
<p>[Reconstruction News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] In response to the tactics adopted by various labor unions after February 1, the Japanese government authorities decided to prohibit each labor union from carrying out independent strikes after the 2nd. Hasegawa, director of the Security Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, said on the 1st that if the labor unions scheduled to carry out a general strike on February 1 carry out individual strikes after the 2nd, they will be regarded as a continuation of the February 1 strike, violating MacArthur's orders, and will be dealt with according to the established policy. If each labor union wishes to strike independently in the future, it must re-apply to the authorities and conduct negotiations. If the negotiations fail, it must file a complaint with the Central Labor Relations Commission, and only after one month of unresolved issues can a strike be carried out. Furthermore, after the dissolution of the All Japan Government Employees Joint Struggle Committee following the suspension of the February 1 strike, the affiliated labor unions held a representatives meeting on the 1st and decided to establish a liaison conference. As a result of the preparatory meeting held today, it was generally agreed that since the general strike was prohibited by MacArthur's orders, it would no longer be possible to carry out strikes in a joint struggle manner. If negotiations are not backed by strikes, success is unlikely. Organizations such as the liaison conference are no longer necessary at this stage, and such organizations will restrict the individual negotiations of each labor union. Therefore, the liaison conference also decided to abolish itself. The joint struggle organization, which had mobilized 2.6 million public employees since last October to plan a historic general strike, was officially declared dissolved.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Six New Toxic Substances for Manufacturing Atomic Bombs: Radiation Can Easily Penetrate Bone Marrow and Kill</h3>
<p>[United Press dispatch from New York, 1st] Dr. Hamilton of the University of California reported to the American Physical Society today that six new elements have been discovered, all derived from atomic fission and are non-gaseous metallic substances. They are the most toxic substances known to science, hence the name "Terrible Half-Dozen." Silver fission can produce these six toxic substances, and its toxicity is equal to that produced by atomic fission. Uranium fission can also produce these six toxic substances, but its toxicity is less than that of its products. These six new toxic substances are all common metals, but when produced by atomic fission, they are isotopes that emit radiation for months. The harm of this mismatch of metal atoms is that they and their mother substance settle in the inner layer of the bone, close to the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the greatest weakness of humans when subjected to radiation attacks. Radiation kills bone marrow faster than other tissues. Toxins in the inner layer of the bone can reach the bone marrow, but when eaten with food, they do not enter the bloodstream, so they cannot reach the bone and are excreted from the body without causing harm. If inhaled into the lungs by spraying or brought into contact with a wound, it can reach the bone and be fatal. These six toxic substances are isotopes of silver, strontium, yttrium, and cesium.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Announces: No Evacuation of American Nationals in the Holy Land</h3>

<h3>Five-Person Investigation Committee Continued Inspection Yesterday: Obvious Fingerprints Photographed on Wang's Smashed Wardrobe: Criminal's Head Likely to Be Unsaved: Testimony of Clothing Store Owner Worth Noting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Ximo Road Fire Investigation Committee went to the Zhenhua Paint Company on Xinza Road yesterday afternoon to inspect the Wang family's wardrobe, which was chopped open by firefighters with axes. The interior of the wardrobe door was covered in fingerprints, clearly visible. Zhang Da, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, immediately ordered the police bureau to photograph the fingerprints for comparison with the fingerprints of the firefighters. Chief Zhang said, "This is the fairest and most effective method. The criminal's head is likely to be unsaved."</p>
<p>The Investigation Committee continued to interview Song Zhipeng, a military police officer from the 23rd Regiment, yesterday. He was present on the scene and contacted the US military. He witnessed the firefighters not working hard to put out the fire but gathering in the 洋房 at No. 15 to eat oranges, peanuts, etc. According to him, when he arrived at the scene of the fire, the fire had already spread to the 洋房 at No. 21. He met a Mr. Tang, a resident of No. 11, and immediately told him that the fire had not yet spread backwards, so he should rescue his belongings as soon as possible. At that time, he helped him move out a women's bicycle. He saw many firefighters chatting at No. 15. One of them asked him, "Military Police, can we have a drink of water?" They picked up bottles of boiled water from the ground and drank from them. He said, "Go put out the fire after you're done drinking," and then retreated. When he went back in a second time, he saw a short firefighter, who appeared to be a team leader, about to eat food from the cupboard and asked him, "Do you want an orange?" He said, "No," but he didn't remember the firefighter's number. He left the scene of the fire at 3:00 the next day.</p>
<h3>Fire Rekindled Twice: Said to Be Gasoline</h3>
<p>Song also said that he saw many firefighters sitting and resting in Xu Shun's and Zhu Youxin's clothing stores, talking and laughing. The Investigation Committee immediately interviewed the two clothing stores, but there was no new information. However, according to Zhu Wangshi, the owner of Zhu Youxin's clothing store, she heard Wang's coachman say that he had already agreed on a price with the firefighters, but because the gold bars were locked in the safe and could not be opened, the firefighters did not put out the fire. She also heard others say that the fire rekindled the second time because the firefighters poured gasoline on it.</p>
<p>Prepare a Report and Submit It to the Mayor</p>
<p>Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, met with Mayor Wu yesterday and reported on the work of the Investigation Committee in recent days. Mayor Wu said that the reason for the fire rekindling after being extinguished must be investigated in detail, and the Wang family's rubble site must be excavated urgently. The municipal government can bear all the costs, but representatives from the police bureau, the Bao Tian Chu, and the Wang family must be present to supervise. Mayor Wu also hoped that the Investigation Committee could collect information and prepare a report to be submitted to the municipal government today. The Investigation Committee has decided to send the administrative part of the case, including the time of the fire and the time it was reported, the rescue situation, and fire-fighting equipment, based on reports from all parties, to Mayor Wu today. As for the judicial part, a statistical table will be prepared, listing the people who still need to be investigated by category, such as when the firefighters arrived at the scene of the fire, which houses they entered, what kind of work they did, and what kind of improper behavior they may have had. Based on the reports of senior officials, fire victims, and eyewitnesses at the time, it should not be difficult to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>
<p>Improve Facilities, Do Not Offer Opinions</p>
<p>Regarding how to improve fire-fighting facilities in the future, the Investigation Committee does not intend to express its opinions for the time being, but awaits the Fire Department to automatically announce its improvement plan. The scope of fire-fighting is very large, and equipment, organization, command, training, etc. are all interconnected. After the Fire Department learns from the lessons of this fire, it is deeply believed that it will have new discoveries to seek improvement.</p>

<h3>Yang Bufi and Zheng Binggeng to Come to Shanghai to Take Up New Posts</h3>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu was summoned to Beijing. Because of physical exhaustion, he requested to resign. News has emerged that the supreme authorities, to maintain the overall picture, have arranged for Vice-Director Shu Ping to be promoted to acting director of the police department. In addition, there will be one additional vice-commander and one additional vice-director in the garrison command and the Shanghai branch of the Central Training Corps respectively. It has been decided that Yang Bufi, who is currently the secretary general of the Quzhou Pacification Command, will be transferred to Shanghai to serve as vice-commander. Zheng Binggeng, major general of the Central Training Corps, has been appointed to the Central Training Corps Shanghai branch vice-director position. As soon as the formal orders arrive, both Yang and Zheng will take up their new roles, coming from Zhejiang Province to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"What Kind of Morality Can One Speak of in Shanghai?": Purpose of Inspection from Government Officials Focuses on Maintaining Security: Police Department Drafts Unified Inspection Methods</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command has drafted uniform inspection methods in order to improve the method of inspecting hostels in Shanghai. Commander Xuan reviewed the measures a few days ago. According to Commander Xuan, all military police investigation offices and police departments can conduct hostel inspections to the extent of their powers. In view of current suggestions, unified inspections will be implemented in the future, and the methods will be announced in the next few days. The reporter asked what the purpose of hostel inspections was.  Is it to value morality over security?  Commander Xuan smiled and answered, "What kind of morality can one speak of in Shanghai today?" He said that the purpose of hostel inspections is primarily for security. In the past, many of the lairs for bandits in Shanghai that had been raided have been found to be hostel rooms, because it is easy to hide in hostels. Likewise, those who smuggle weapons and sell opium often hide in hostels. Thus, hostel inspections are an important task in maintaining security, and the inspection's focus is not as rumoured in valuing morality.</p>
<h3>"Second Fourth" Farmer's Day Will Open Commemorative Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Extraordinary Union: Li Shizeng Appreciates Trusted Friend: White Hair Ushers in New Groom</h3>
<p>Bride Lin Susang Has Hair Adorned with Red Flowers, with a Healthy Countenance</p>
<p>Childhood Friend Presides Over Wedding: Congratulations on Producing a Gifted Son; Echoes of Laughter: Door is Filled with Happiness</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Party stalwart Li Shizeng and Ms. Lin Sushan held their wedding at the "World Culture Cooperation China Association" on Lin Sen Middle Road yesterday afternoon. This pair of "Eternal Youth" in matrimony commenced their extraordinary union in a simple, grand, and warm ceremony. The small auditorium was packed, and the door was adorned with a congratulatory couplet written by Cheng Zhongheng: "Swear Together to Save the World, Sincere Love Will Rebuild the Home." The words "Mutual Aid" were written in the center of the auditorium. The groom and bride arrived by flower car at 4:30PM, and were surrounded by photographers at the stone steps at the entrance. The groom, in a long robe and riding jacket, was energetic, and the bride, with a red flower hairclip and cheongsam, had a healthy bearing and was always smiling. The wedding ceremony started shortly after, with Wu Zhilao as the officiator.</p>
<p>Wu Zhilao's congratulatory speech cited history and talked about the significance of marital union. His witty words drew applause from the guests from time to time. When he said, "Maybe you will have a son in the future," laughter echoed throughout the auditorium, filling it with happiness.  Finally, he hoped that the newlyweds could cooperate with each other to mutually benefit society.</p>
<p>The groom also said a few words. He said, "This wedding ceremony was originally intended to be very simple, but the skill of the journalists is too high, and it seems that there are so many guests here today, it seems not so simple after all. However, thank you all for coming to offer your congratulations. Thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>Someone among the guests shouted, "Please ask the bride, Ms. Lin, to say a few words too," but that wish was not realized. The wedding ceremony ended amidst the murmuring of refreshments and conversations.</p>
<p>Mr. Li is currently seventy-eight years old. His original wife, Yao Tongyi, died of illness in France during the War of Resistance Against Japan. While in the United States, Mr. Li formed a relationship with an American Jewish woman, Mrs. Rousou, with whom he bonded as a result of intellectual pursuits. Upon returning to China, because times have changed, they could not live together, and their relationship came to an end last year. Ms. Lin Sushan is currently over thirty years old. Formerly the wife of Jiao Juyin, a drama producer who studied in France, this union with Mr. Li comes with the following explanation in Mr. Li's written statement: "Ms. Lin Sushan and her former husband were both colleagues who I have known for many years.  Last year, there were domestic changes, and I attempted to mediate to no avail.  I learned much about Ms. Lin in the process, and grew to admire her.  After she terminated her marital relations, Ms. Lin and I cooperated at the "World" publication, and together researched people's philosophies. We found that our beliefs and goals matched, and I saw her as a virtuous helpmate.  I thus seek to form a new family with her, with hopes of advancing social change.  No one can do this better than Ms. Lin.  Despite my being close to my seventieth birthday, she did not forsake me. After rejecting my requests on many occasions, she eventually agreed, saying sincerely: "I see you as a mentor, and do not think of anything else." I am extremely grateful for this.  Society and friends call her "Ms. Lin," and I will likewise call her "Mr. Lin." It's not only because of English lessons. Overall, our respect and mutual aid and love will be for eternity.  I dare to disclose this most sincere sentiment."</p>

<h3>Transfer of Enemy Property Shares, Decision on Handling Method</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange Brokers Association stated that after enemy and puppet properties were reported, the stock transfer was suspended in accordance with the law. However, some tea seed stocks were obtained by brokers before the report, and it was unknown how to handle the situation. The association asked the Enemy Property Clearing Office for an explanation. The Clearing Office stated that the issue was whether the transfer of inverse stocks after the victory should be recognized as valid. According to regulations, the principle of handling the transfer of enemy and puppet properties in good faith before August 11, 1935, should be invalid, but the Executive Yuan also stipulated that if it was not clearly known that the property would be confiscated or that there was collusion, it could not be deemed invalid, so the office could not resolve the issue. Yesterday, the Reverse Property Review Committee decided that, unless there were special reasons, it should still be determined whether or not the transfer had been completed.</p>

However, the tax revenue figures for January can be offset by the partial collection of business tax, so it will not differ too much from December of last year.</p>

<h3>A Merchant Fails in Speculation, Commits Suicide by Poisoning Regardless of Wife and Children</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wan Shuzi, a native of Hangzhou, who worked for China Lianyi Products Company, was over forty years old, married Zhong Qiwen, and had six children. Recently, she became pregnant again and was about to give birth. Shuzi had recently failed in speculation and was under severe economic pressure. He had the idea of taking his own life, so he went to room 421 of the Nanjing Hotel at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, he asked the waiter to estimate the price of the wine and drank heavily. The waiter did not suspect anything else. The next day, at about 12:00 noon, Wan had not yet gotten up. The day waiter went and knocked on the door but there was no response. He managed to open the door and saw the guest lying stiffly on the bed, without any sound. He touched him and found that he had already died. A suicide note was found on the table, and an empty bottle of poisonous juice was found in the drawer. He knew that he had committed suicide by poisoning. In his suicide note to his wife, Zhong Qiwen, he claimed that it was not his intention to resort to this strategy, and said: "Don't be sad after death, because leaving me will make it impossible for the family to do anything. I hope you will support the family for the sake of the children, and the future will always be good. I am naturally clumsy and cannot escape this harsh environment. The only way is to die.

After the hotel waiter discovered the case, he reported it to the Huangpu Branch, which sent personnel to investigate. The deceased's family was still well-off, but he committed suicide due to failure in speculation. Because the deceased's wife was pregnant and about to give birth, the body was collected by his younger brother Wan Xiaozhong after the autopsy.</p>

<h3>A Grand Gathering of the Legal Profession, Four Hundred Advocates Show Off Their Talents, Chen Tingrui, Jiang Pingfan, etc. Elected as Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road, which used to be deserted, suddenly became busy yesterday afternoon. Almost all the lawyers in Shanghai were mobilized to participate in the members' congress that had been interrupted for ten years since the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>One by one, the famous lawyers who are often seen in the newspapers appeared on the signature book, shaking hands, talking, and the whole place was filled with happy laughter. There were also more than twenty female lawyers. Chen Tingrui said with emotion: "We held a members' congress in 1937, followed by the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge. Ten years have passed in a blink of an eye. Today is the first grand gathering of the legal profession since the Anti-Japanese War!" Mr. Shen Junqiao shook his elderly head and said: "I entered the gate of the Lawyers Association, as if a married daughter had returned to her parents' home." Jiang Yiping came in, shaking hands one by one, the demeanor of a famous lawyer, after all, is extraordinary. The Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road is a building built by the members themselves. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was rented to Datong University as a school building. It was recovered after the victory, but the interior was empty. The chairs used for the meeting were borrowed from the Ningbo Fellow Association.</p>
<p>The Number of Lawyers in Shanghai Reaches Over a Thousand The association currently has 1,074 members, and more than 400 people attended yesterday (according to regulations, one-third of the attendance is enough to meet the quorum).</p>
<p>The meeting started at 2:00 PM. Chairman Chen Tingrui reported: "The Constitution has been promulgated, and China is on the road to the rule of law. Therefore, our responsibility as lawyers is even greater than before. How to promote the Constitution? How to promote the rule of law? How to improve the judiciary? These are all our future tasks. We must encourage each other and urge each other to complete this mission of the times." Then, Chen Su, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech. After Chen Tingrui reported on the association's affairs, the draft of the Shanghai Lawyers Association Charter was discussed. At this point, the members expressed their fierce debates, with sharp tongues and lips, nitpicking, and all the housekeeping skills were brought out.</p>
<p>The first controversial issue was the dispute between 10,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan for membership fees. The original proposal stipulated that members should pay a recurring fee of 10,000 yuan per friend. Qu Cheng thought it was too much and advocated 5,000 yuan. Jiang Yiping retorted: "Now it costs at least two or three thousand yuan to take a rickshaw once, so 10,000 yuan is really not too much." Qu Cheng retorted: "Now it costs tens of thousands to eat a meal. Should the membership fee also be set at tens of thousands?" Before the dispute was resolved, Cheng Yaojin came out halfway and felt that 10,000 yuan was still too little and advocated 20,000 yuan per month. The result of the vote was still to maintain the original proposal.</p>
<p>Collection of Public Fees Based on Index Another controversial issue was Article 27 of Chapter 7 of the original draft, "Remuneration," which was in the interest of all members, and everyone discussed it with great concentration. Bo Zhu and Zhou Hongji both believed that the amount set in the original proposal was too low. Jiang Yiping proposed to change "Remuneration" to "Public Fees." The result of the vote was to change it to "Members who are entrusted by the parties to handle litigation cases may collect public fees, the amount of which shall be increased according to the standard ratio of the 1937 cost of living index."</p>
<p>Gathering more than 400 advocates in one hall, everyone spoke at once, scrambling for the "microphone" under the stage, and the presiding chairman tried his best to control the order of the venue. Outside the window, the curtain had slowly fallen, and there were no electric lights in the hall on the third floor. A large gasoline lamp was temporarily hung up.</p>
<p>The result of the re-election of directors and supervisors was that twenty-one directors and seven supervisors were elected. Below is a list, and I will briefly analyze the systems to which they belong:</p>
<p>List of Newly Elected Directors and Supervisors Directors: Chen [illegible] Rui, Jiang Yiping, Zai Jimei, Zheng Lintong, Tang Juexian, Yu Enliang (above are from the Soochow University system), Shen Junru, Zhang Qiping, Zhang Zhiguo, Feng Song, Ju Jiansheng (law school system); Shan Yinghui, Wu Xiangxian, Han Xueyi, Zhang Guangzong, Wang Shanxiang (law and political science school system), Wang Jianduo, Zhou Kun, Chen Huapeng, Yin Yong (Chih Tze College system); Yu Zhongluo (Zhejiang Law College system). Supervisors: Jiang Pingfan, Xu Zhishen (Soochow University system); Qian Zheng, Wang Peiji (law school system); Wu Bianhua (law and political science school system); Huang Jiyuan (Chih Tze College system); Xu Zuoliang (Zhejiang Law College system).</p>
<p>It was already dusk when the meeting ended, and the lights of thousands of homes were lit. Everyone poured out, easily embarking on the journey home, and could not forget the sentence in their hearts: "The first grand gathering of the legal profession in ten years!"</p>

<h3>Nostalgic Film History</h3>
<p>Special Article in This Newspaper</p>
<p>Every day, 300,000 people flock in and out of dozens of cinemas throughout the city. Movies have occupied the most important place in the entertainment life of Shanghai citizens. However, the establishment of cinemas and the formal performance of movies in Shanghai only happened within the first decade of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The predecessor of movies—lantern slides—was performed by Mr. Yan Yongjing in the Gezhi College in October of the eleventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, and the content was roughly some "World Compilations." Because it was amateurish, it did not have much impact.</p>
<p>In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu (1903), a Spaniard named A. Ramos brought a semi-old movie projector and several rolls of dilapidated films to Shanghai. He showed them in the Shengping Teahouse on Fuzhou Road, with some Indians shouting loudly at the door every day, and tickets were 30 cents per person. Years later, Mr. Ramos used the profits he earned to build a sheet metal movie theater on Zhabei Road, Haining Road (now Hongkou Grand Theater). The first movie he showed was called "The Dragon Nest". Later, he built the "Victoria Movie Theater" at the intersection of North Sichuan Road, Haining Road. The decoration and furnishings were relatively luxurious. This was the beginning of Shanghai having a formal cinema.</p>
<p>Due to the success of Mr. Ramos's operation, a Portuguese Russian named S. G. Hertzberg founded the "Apollo Movie Theater" on North Sichuan Road in the second year of Xuantong, competing with Victoria. In addition, a Westerner named A. Runiahn reorganized the Mingsheng Liyuan at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road, into the "Allen Movie Theater" (later renamed "New Allen", which was abandoned after the January 28th Incident). The Zhonghua Grand Theater on Qiujiang Road was also reorganized by Cantonese businessman Zeng Huantang into the "Shanghai Grand Theater", and the business was very developed. In order to compete in business, Mr. Ramos tried his best to set up cinemas in the city. The original site of the current Dahua Workers' Theater was the Summer Peacock Movie Theater operated by Mr. Ramos, which was very popular at the time. In addition, Mr. Ramos successively built the Empire, Carde, and Universal in the South, Central, and East districts. Mr. Ramos's manager, B. Goldenberg, also established the China Movie Theater on Wuzhou Road and the Republic Movie Theater on Fangbang Bridge. Mr. Ramos's power became increasingly strong. Therefore, some people still call Mr. Ramos the "Shanghai Cinema King".</p>
<p>In 1923, the "China Movie Theater Company" of Tianjin came to Shanghai to establish the "Carlton Grand Theater". At that time, its scale was unique in Shanghai. On February 9 of that year, it opened with the famous movie "Secrets of the Louvre", and the ticket price was as high as 2 yuan. Compared with the small movie theaters at that time, where you could watch a movie for eight or nine copper coins, it was naturally remarkable. After the opening, it was praised by the audience as the "No. 1 Cinema in Shanghai".</p>
<p>Following the Carlton, the "Audion Grand Theater" on North Sichuan Road was built by Chen Bozhao, the general manager of the Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, with his own investment. The layout was luxurious and could compete with the Carlton. Mr. Chen also operated the "Audion Film Company" to handle film distribution. Films produced by Paramount Pictures of the United States were managed by him, and his reputation greatly increased. Later, he built the "Broadway Grand Theater" in the East District and the "New Light Grand Theater" in the Central District. In 1932, Audion was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. At the same time, because first-class cinemas such as Nanjing, Grand Theater, Cathay, and Great Shanghai had been established one after another, New Light could no longer be the most powerful, and Broadway was even less significant. The golden age of Audion Film Company became a thing of the past.</p>
<h3>Palace of National Films</h3>
<p>China's film production industry lags behind the cinema industry by about ten years. Therefore, in the very early days, cinemas only showed foreign films. In fact, when Victoria and the Embankment areas were popular, about nine out of ten cinema audiences were foreigners, and very few Chinese people went to see them. In the early years of the Republic of China, when the Chinese film production industry was just starting to flourish, most of the production took place in Shanghai. However, there were no large cinemas operated by Chinese themselves to show domestically produced films, so they had to rely on the Remas circuit of cinemas. At that time, the Summer Picture Palace did become the venue for the first runs of domestically produced films.</p>
<p>However, the interests of Chinese film production companies in Shanghai were controlled by Remas in every way, which inevitably had an impact. The production industry collectively sought ways to remedy this. Initially, they planned to unite the powerful production companies and lease all of Remas's cinemas, but this did not materialize due to disagreements on rental prices. In 1925, the Star Film Company proposed to operate its own cinema. They consulted with the Pathé Company and purchased the Shenjiang Cooperative Stage at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Yunnan Road, converting it into the Central Grand Theatre. From then on, Star had its own theater, and the outlet for its works was naturally no longer a problem. The other production companies, such as Shanghai, Lily, Guoguang, Great Wall, Shenzhou, and China, mostly gathered at the Central Grand Theatre. They had all suffered from the pain of foreign trust monopolies, so the Central Grand Theatre replaced the Summer Picture Palace as the "Palace of National Films," which was a major turning point for the film production industry. The opening declaration of the Central Grand Theatre also stated: "There are already many cinemas in Shanghai, so why add another one? There is a need, because the cinemas in Shanghai do not consider the interests of the Chinese people enough. We do not want foreigners to control the film industry too much, so we believe it is indeed necessary to add one."</p>
<p>This "Palace of National Films" did promote its mission in 1925 and 1926. Furthermore, due to the May Thirtieth Incident, the public's interest in foreign films also cooled sharply. The output of domestic films increased significantly, showing improvement. In March 1926, Remas, laden with the profits of his twenty years of operating a film business in Shanghai, returned to his home country. Star Company and others jointly raised capital to lease Summer Picture Palace, Victoria, Empire, Universal, and Carlton theaters. At the same time, they organized the "Central Cinema Company." Except for Summer Picture Palace, which was subleased to Mr. Owen Bahl, the owner of the Embankment, the rest were managed independently. Victoria was renamed "New Central." Later, it absorbed the China Peace Cinema. It promoted "advocating domestic films" and used the originally established Central Grand Theatre as its flagship theater.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, domestic films did not strive for progress. Films featuring gods and monsters, martial arts, and farcical stories flooded the film industry. These were crudely made and destroyed their own future. In late July 1926, the Central Film Company began adding European and American films to its screenings. Furthermore, because the architecture of its cinemas could not compare with newly built theaters, its position declined daily, and the film input also decreased. The rights to first-run domestic films shifted from "Central" to "New Light," and then from "New Light" to "Golden City." In 1936, the Central Cinema Company ceased operations. The theaters under its jurisdiction were all leased out separately. From its establishment to its closure, it lasted exactly ten years.</p>
<h3>### Spring Dream in the Old Capital – Highly Popular</h3>
<p>The topic still turns to 1926. During that period, a newly emerging cinema, the Beijing Grand Theatre on Beijing Road, was founded by the Yiyi Company. It used first-class equipment to show second and third-run foreign films. Moreover, it pioneered the addition of Chinese subtitles, making it easier for Chinese people who did not understand the plot to understand. Its business was very prosperous. After its renovation in 1930, it screened the first production of the Lianhua Film Company, "Spring Dream in the Old Capital," which was very popular with the audience. After that, the first-run screening rights in Shanghai for Lianhua productions were mostly held by Beijing Grand Theatre, until the completion of the Golden City Grand Theatre, at which point this exclusive right disappeared. It was rebuilt in 1934 and renamed "Lido," affiliated with the Lianyi Company, and continued to show Western films.</p>
<p>Shortly before the opening of the Beijing Grand Theatre, the Donghua Cinema, which is now the Paris, was also established on Lin Sen Road. In the decisive year, it was leased to the Peacock Film Company and renamed "Peacock Donghua." In 1930, the owner changed again, and the name of the theater was changed to "Paris."</p>
<p>Following Beijing Donghua, the Guanglu Grand Theatre, built on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, appeared as a first-class cinema. The opening film was "The Wandering Butterfly Harvester" (Ivan Mosjukine in "Casanova"). Initially, it specialized in screening European films, and its business was unfavorable. In 1929, it was taken over by the Far East Amusement Company, which installed a sound film projector and specialized in showing Paramount sound dialogue films. Its business was so good that it was the heyday of Guanglu. Later, it was subleased to British management. After the Cathay and Grand Theatre were established one after another, Guanglu's business suddenly suffered a blow. In addition, the United Film Company acquired Paramount's top-notch films at a high price, Guanglu became increasingly unable to support itself, and eventually went bankrupt. It was later acquired by the Lyceum Theatre and reopened, focusing on screening European films. After the Lyceum ceased showing films, Guanglu specialized in showing second-run American films.</p>
<h3>### Former Site of the Grand Theatre – Carlton Dance Hall</h3>
<p>From 1928 to 1932, the growth of cinemas was surprisingly rapid. In addition to second-class cinemas such as Donghai, Penglai, Shanxi, Guanghua, Mingxing, and Xihai, which were established one after another, first-class cinemas with great scale and excellent equipment, such as Nanjing, Grand Theatre, Cathay, and Grand Shanghai, were also built at this time. (The Grand Theatre is pictured on the right)</p>
<p>The former site of the Grand Theatre was the Carlton Dance Hall. It was built in the winter of 1928 and was a Sino-American joint venture. At that time, its position was not enough to compete with Carlton. In 1930, the Nanjing Grand Theatre, operated by the Nanyi Company, was built on Edward Road and began to overwhelm Carlton, Odeon, and Guanglu, which was then holding a seat. Its building adopted the "Renaissance" style, and the interior was equipped with winter heating and summer cooling. At the opening, the New York Daily News called it "America's Roxy." On New Year's Day in 1932, the Cathay Grand Theatre at the corner of Xiafei Road and Meyer Road opened with Norma Shearer's "A Free Soul." Its furnishings were magnificent, and it specialized in screening MGM masterpieces, thus adding another first-class cinema.</p>
<p>It is necessary to mention a "our country" person who joined British nationality, named Shi Lugen. He operated cinemas in various parts of China and managed the productions of foreign film companies. In 1932, he and Chinese and foreign tycoons launched the United Film Company, planning to acquire the city's first-class cinemas. The first step was to demolish the Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road and rebuild it, investing 1.1 million taels. The entire building adopted a modern three-dimensional style, and there were three fountains inside. The equipment also included air conditioning and RCA sound film projectors. When it opened in the summer of the following year with "Hot Blood," the whole city was overwhelmed. Lugen was ambitious. He used the Grand Theatre as the main force of the United Company. In addition to striving for perfection in the construction and equipment, he also lowered the seat prices, making it impossible for other first-run theaters to resist. The first to be affected was Guanglu, which was forced to close its doors. And Cathay, Carlton, as well as Paris, Rongguang, Shanghai, Mingzhu, Huade and other small and medium-sized cinemas also joined the United Company banner.</p>
<p>The Lianyi Company (formerly the Nanyi Company, formerly known as the Yiyi Company) was enough to confront the United Company. In addition to the Beijing Grand Theatre and the Nanjing Grand Theatre under its jurisdiction, it also took over the Grand Shanghai Grand Theatre in 1934. The Grand Shanghai was originally founded by the Rongrong Company, and its momentum was really prominent at that time. After Beijing was rebuilt as Lido, it specialized in acquiring the second-run screening rights for the films shown by Nanjing and Grand Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is said that Lugen's trust dream did not last long, only because all the equity was sold to the real estate of the cinema, and the operation was not good. The debt was so high that the creditors sued, causing the United Company to almost collapse. Fortunately, the measures were taken properly, and the storm did not expand. So he abandoned many small theaters and only operated Cathay and Grand Theatre, renamed "Guoguang Company." Until June 1938, because it was considered necessary for cinemas to organize a united front, it merged with Nanjing, Grand Shanghai, Lido, etc. to form the "Asian Cinema Company."</p>
<p>During the isolated island period in Shanghai, due to the development of the film business, about the Dahua Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road and the Majestic Theatre on Gordon Road were newly established. In addition, Huguang on Edward Road and Jindu on Fuzhao Road also competed with Golden City and New Light for the position of first-run domestic films.</p>
<p>As for the existing cinemas, including Dooly, there are already seventeen showing films in sequence. Among them, the Majestic, Grand Theatre, Keyes, and Nanjing theaters show works produced by RKO, Paramount, and Columbia. Dahua specializes in MGM productions, Grand Shanghai specializes in Shidianhua works, Golden Gate Paris shows Warner MGM, Yunguang New Light sometimes shows Universal works, Lyceum sometimes shows British films, and Dooly shows a number of Soviet films. In addition to being shown in Golden City and New Light, domestic films are also regularly shown at the Queen's Grand Theatre, which was converted from a Peking Opera theater. Because the output of domestic films is not large, almost all of them are American films. Please refer to page 12 of this newspaper for the names of existing cinemas. I have said too much, please forgive me for not going into details.</p>
<h3>### An Episode – American, British, and Japanese Residents Engage in a Major Brawl</h3>
<p>When the earliest cinema in Shanghai, the Hongkou Grand Theatre, opened, the films shown were all newsreels of the Russo-Japanese War. Most of the audience were British and American residents, who sat in the front row. The back row was full of Japanese people. When those British and American residents saw the Japanese's funny movements in the film, they couldn't help but clap and laugh. The Japanese people sitting in the back row became angry, and the two sides started a dispute, tearing off the wooden chair backs and using them as weapons, fighting until their heads were broken and bleeding, and the theater was in a mess.</p>
<p>The picture above is the Queen's Grand Theatre</p>
<p>The picture on the right is the Dahua Grand Theatre, formerly the Summer Picture Palace</p>
<h3>### Nine Fifteen Club</h3>
<p>Nine fifteen is exactly the time for the evening film screening. The "Nine Fifteen Club" is also a place to show movies. There are no daytime screenings there, only evening screenings, hence the name "Nine Fifteen Club."</p>
<p>This is a secret organization formed by movie fans. When Shanghai became an isolated island, the pressure exerted by the Japanese invaders on the concessions increased day by day. Many stimulating American films could not be shown in theaters. So many British and American movie fans formed a group to specialize in showing films that could not be seen outside. At this time, the Japanese invaders had not yet moved into the concessions, so this secret organization was able to stand firm.</p>
<p>The "Nine Fifteen Club" is located on the eighth floor of the Sassoon Building on the Bund of Nanjing Road, where there is a life-or-death place that can accommodate 200 audiences. It is stipulated that it will be shown twice a week, showing many very new films. Chaplin's The Great Dictator had already been shown there. This club lasted for two years, and it was disbanded invisibly after the outbreak of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Majestic Theatre</p>
<p>The domestic film Iron Island with aviation as the theme was produced by the Lianhua Film Company before the war.</p>
<h3>### The First Sound Film</h3>
<p>Now that the general audience is tired of black and white films and vying to watch color films, recalling the era of silent films when they were only allowed to watch but not listen cannot help but make people laugh. When I was a child, sitting in an open-air cinema, watching the "Female Knight-Errant of the Desolate River" on the screen opening and closing her mouth, but not knowing what the "protagonist" was saying, that kind of wide-eyed, tongue-tied, itchy look always made me feel uncomfortable. Scientific progress is amazing. How long has it been, the screen has become so "colorful", and the film advertisements in the newspaper have discovered the words "fantastic atomic ten colors". Soon, in addition to "colorful", it may also add "having flavor".</p>
<p>Twenty-one years ago, on a hot evening in New York City, the world's first successful sound film, Warner Bros.'s "Don Juan," premiered! The music accompanied the performance of the picture (but the orchestra was not seen anywhere!). Don Juan on the screen would actually speak! From then on, the screen that had been silent for a long time would never be dumb again!</p>
<p>And it took another five years for sound films to be introduced to China and Shanghai cinemas began to show sound films!</p>
<p>The first Shanghai cinema to install the Photophone sound equipment was the Summer Picture Palace, the authority of cinemas in 1929. The first sound film to meet the Shanghai audience was "Captain Swagger". Relying on the advertisement of "exclusive screening of sound films", Summer Picture Palace dominated Shanghai for half a year. Soon, Grand Theatre, Guanglu, Carlton, Odeon and other cinemas installed sound equipment, and then, except for "Paris", which was once "a crane standing among chickens" and specialized in screening silent films, small and medium-sized cinemas also uniformly installed sound machines.</p>
<p>In fact, before the Summer Picture Palace screened sound films, there had already been two screenings of sound films with picture-side sound in Shanghai. Once in December 1926 and once in November 1928.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1926, the Shanghai Baixing Grand Theatre imported several De Forest sound short films from the United States and screened them in the theater for six days. The content was mostly music and dance tunes and short plays. During the screening, American technicians tried their best to explain the principle of picture-side sound.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi of the Education Department brought back a special Lai film projector in November 1928 and screened it on the 11th of that month. Most of the films shown were also short musical and dance films. The highlight was "Long Island Travelogue", the content of which was wonderful. There is a record of the reporter of this newspaper as the body:</p>
<p>"The train came from far to near, and the sound of the wheels also rose accordingly. When we arrived at Long Island, the rural scenery of Long Island was reflected one by one; the sound of children squeezing milk, the sound of birds, the sound of ducks, the sound of cows, the sound of dogs, and a little boy was awakened by a small flower dog outside the window, rubbing his eyes and crying. Ah, it's so wonderful!"</p>
<h3>### Translation Breeze</h3>
<p>Walking into a cinema showing Western films, most of the audience can't understand the English dialogue on the screen, which is inevitable regret. For this reason, film merchants have also racked their brains to figure out how to remedy this shortcoming. The solution is to install the "translation breeze."</p>
<p>Now, most of the larger cinemas have the equipment for the translation breeze. Each seat is equipped with a plug. You only need to rent that "no money electric earphone" style translation breeze, put it on your ears, and then insert the wire into the plug, and you will be isolated from all the sounds in the cinema, listening to the lady in charge of the explanation speaking fluent and clear Mandarin, translating the dialogue on the screen. In this way, the audience who do not understand English can fully understand the plot and the language of the characters. This method is naturally much better than adding Chinese subtitles.</p>
<p>The first cinema to use the translation breeze was the Grand Theatre, which began to install it in November 1939. This equipment was specially made for the Grand Theatre by the American manufacturer. The rental price was 10 cents per set, which was very cheap. On November 4, the Grand Theatre invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers to test the "Return of the Wonderful Man" film. The first application of the translation breeze was very successful and won unanimous praise.</p>
<p>Most of the ladies who are in charge of the translation breeze explanation are female students from church schools. They have a very good foundation in English, translate accurately, and speak fluently. When the female character on the screen starts singing, she will tell you to take off the translation breeze, and then your ears will change to another world, enjoying the melodious singing.</p>
<p>Renting the translation breeze is suitable for films with complex plots and lengthy dialogues. Song and dance films such as "Bathing Beauty" and "Every Night is Springtime" do not need the translation breeze at all. Even for scripts with relatively simple plots, you can understand them even if you don't understand English, because if you wear the translation breeze, you can't enjoy the music and other things that should be "heard" on the screen. As for renting the translation breeze to watch "Fantasia", that's even worse!</p>
<h3>### Small Pickups from the Film Industry in 1946</h3>
<p>The film scene last year had the following characteristics:</p>
<p>A large number of color films were imported;</p>
<p>Thigh song and dance films such as "Bathing Beauty" are very popular with the audience;</p>
<p>Films based on World War II, using "espionage", "anti-aggression" and other themes are particularly numerous;</p>
<p>Western films flooded the film industry, and there were few domestic films;</p>
<p>Scalpers were rampant.</p>
<p>Among the biopics, "The Great Dictator", "The Story of Emile Zola", "The Light of the Nation", and "Madame Curie" are pretty good. What is worth mentioning is that cartoon master Walt Disney gave us a lot of good works: "Dumbo", "Victory Through Air Power", "Bambi", "The Three Caballeros", and "Fantasia", etc.</p>
<p>Among Western films, American films account for 95.1% more. British films account for only 0.4%, and the rest are Soviet films.</p>
<p>Among domestic films, most of them use "anti-Japanese war" as the theme. Among American films, there are also many films such as "China Shall Rise" that use "Chinese anti-Japanese prosperity" as the theme, but it is a pity that it is a bit "scratching the surface", and perhaps the actual situation in China was ignored when directing, but they just praised themselves, so in many films, I can't find a good one.</p>
<p>"The Dangerous Curve", "Endless Spring", "Desperately Attacking Women", "Fierce Fighting", "Aerialist", "Stereoscopic Bombing", "Nazi Tycoon Sexily Bewitched, Spring Boudoir Young Woman娇滴滴", "Dangerous Scenes More and More Ruthless", "Dazzling and Charming", etc.</p>
<p>Oh, how grand! Oh, how grand!</p>

<h3>The Authorities are Determined to Stabilize Food Prices and Sell as Much Stocked Siamese Rice as Possible</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Handwritten Order to the Police and Social Bureaus: Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding and Price Manipulation</p>
<p>The problem of food rice is becoming serious again. The Social Bureau aimed at the opening of a red disc on the Shangxuan-Yihong board. Siamese rice was sold one after another. Up to Saturday last week, 42,550 zu were sold in a week. However, due to the rising news from the production areas such as Su, Xi, and Chang, the Taishi rice merchants took the opportunity to act, causing the long-term stable grain prices to fluctuate sharply in the past week. By the close of the market on Saturday, white japonica suddenly hit 90,000 major points, creating an unprecedented new record for rice prices. Although yesterday was Sunday and the market was closed, some retail stores privately raised the future price to 100,000 yuan, and some retailers even regarded the stored rice as a rare commodity and refused to sell it. Mayor Wu was furious when he heard the news. Yesterday, he issued an emergency handwritten order, ordering the Police and Social Bureaus to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter. If the above-mentioned situation is found, it will be punished as a crime of hoarding people's food during an emergency period and sentenced to the extreme penalty. He also sincerely expressed to reporters that the government has a major determination to stabilize food prices and stabilize people's livelihood. The recent rise in rice prices in this city is purely due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. The government has decided to focus on reality and do its best to stabilize food prices. The people of Tairen have already settled with the Shanghai Rice Storage Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. Starting today, Siamese rice will be sold without restriction. Those who illegally hoard and manipulate grain prices will be punished with the extreme penalty and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>President Song is Concerned about People's Food</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen expressed great concern about the sharp rise in rice prices in Taishi. He specially summoned Mayor Wu yesterday morning and ordered him to be responsible for suppressing the prices, and urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Food, ordering him to assist the Shanghai Municipal Government in implementing measures to stabilize food prices.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food Sells Siamese Rice</p>
<p>In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities specially sent Section Chief Ji of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau to visit Director Ye of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food to discuss measures. It was decided to sell the third batch of 95,000 bags of food rice shipped from Siam on the 24th of last month at 65,000 yuan per stone as much as possible in the market to suppress the rising trend. It is also heard that the fourth batch of foreign rice will also arrive in Shanghai one after another.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Implements Price Limits</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and both the North and South Rice Markets were closed. The prices of white japonica sold by rice shops varied greatly, exceeding the price limit greatly. It is reported that the grain management section of the Social Bureau has been ordered to implement the price limit order. In addition to sending personnel to the rice market today to supervise transactions, personnel will also be sent to various districts to inspect the door-to-door sales of rice shops. All rice shops should mark the rice prices uniformly. Those who do not mark the rice prices, arbitrarily raise prices, and hoard a large amount will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Cooking Oil Has Reached More Than 3,000 Piculs</h3>
<p>The Joint Rationing Office for Cooking Oil was still open as usual for oil rationing yesterday, although it was Sunday. Retailers went to register, pay, and clear the oil rationing, which was quite enthusiastic. As of yesterday, a total of 3,960 piculs of cooking oil had been rationed, with each household only receiving one barrel each of soybean oil and sesame oil. The price of soybean oil was 180,000 yuan per picul, and the price of sesame oil was 165,000 yuan. The office also stipulated that all retailers who fail to collect the oil after being notified twice will have their eligibility for rationing canceled.</p>
<h3>Provincial Bank United Exchange Office is Ordered by the Ministry to Start Preparation</h3>
<p>In order to invigorate finance and facilitate inter-provincial remittances, the Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment of joint remittance offices by provincial banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The articles of association of its organization have been approved by the Ministry of Finance on January 21 with Jingqian Wuzi No. 15327. After receiving this telegram order, the provincial banks in Shanghai have exchanged opinions with each other and decided to prepare for the establishment of the National Provincial Bank, Shanghai United Exchange Office, and have scheduled a meeting of the people in charge of the provincial banks stationed in Shanghai this week to discuss the implementation methods. The articles of association of the National Provincial Bank United Exchange Office approved by the Ministry of Finance are explored as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: In order to facilitate inter-provincial remittances to major ports outside the province, provincial banks, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, will establish National Provincial Bank United Exchange Offices in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, which are named National Provincial Bank, (a certain place) United Exchange Office (hereinafter referred to as the United Exchange Office). Article 2: Provincial banks may participate in the United Exchange Office in a certain place depending on the needs of their remittance business. Article 3: The United Exchange Office shall have one director to preside over all affairs of the office, who shall be elected by the participating banks. Article 4: The United Exchange Office shall appoint a number of staff members to handle affairs in groups, who shall be transferred from the participating banks by the director. In order to facilitate liaison with remittance business, each participating bank may also send personnel to the office to handle affairs. Article 5: The expenses of the United Exchange Office shall be distributed among the participating banks. Article 6: The remittance methods and accounting rules of the United Exchange Office shall be specified separately. Article 7: These regulations shall be reported to the Ministry of Finance for the record, and the same shall apply when modifying them.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Market Price of Flour Rationing of Foreign Flour Starting the Day After Tomorrow 320,000 Bags Still Rationing Domestic Flour Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Flour is one of the main people's food. In the past few days, due to the high price of flour, various flour-made foods have also risen in price, which has greatly affected the livelihood of ordinary people. The municipal authorities have agreed with Fuxin, Maoxin, Huafeng, Fufeng, and other five major flour manufacturers that 12,000 bags will still be rationed every day at a price of 25,000 yuan per bag today and tomorrow. Starting from the day after tomorrow (i.e., the 5th of this month), the Central Trust Bureau and the Ministry of Food will ration foreign flour (i.e., Lilang flour). There will be 160,000 bags of this foreign flour, and the combined domestic flour will reach about 320,000 bags, which will be rationed to retailers and can be rationed until the end of next month. Because the black market price of flour has soared recently, in order to prevent the flour bran guilds that operate this low-priced rationed flour from taking advantage of and engaging in fraudulent activities, the authorities have decided to closely monitor the rationing situation so that the commercial firms that actually operate flour-made foods can generally purchase this rationed flour.</p>
<h3>China Petroleum Corporation: 80,000 Tons of Oil Ordered; Tanker Company to Send Ships Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Due to the insufficient allocation of coal from various coal-producing regions transported to Shanghai by the Fuel Management Committee for general manufacturers in the city, gasoline is being used as a substitute to compensate for the shortfall. According to sources at the China Petroleum Corporation, the number of those applying to purchase gasoline from the company has been increasing monthly. Last month, 60,000 tons were allocated. Among the oil wells located in various regions, Gansu accounts for the largest portion, comprising 70% of the national output. The quality of the oil extracted is relatively poor. The original plan was to transport it via the Longhai Railway to Taiwan for refining. However, certain sections of the Longhai Railway are difficult to repair and have not yet been fully connected, so the plan has not been implemented. All crude oil produced is used locally. However, our country's consumption of various fuel oils is very high. If foreign merchants are allowed to freely transport and sell oil in China, not only will our rights and interests be lost, but it will also be difficult to control. In light of this, the company has decided to form the China Tanker Company to purchase oil directly from Iran. It is currently negotiating favorable terms with the British-Iranian and American-Iranian oil companies through diplomatic channels, and some progress has been made. Once the source quantity and other necessary procedures are completed, the tanker company will be notified to proceed with loading. The tanker company has a total of 22 tankers, including four of 10,000 tons each and eighteen of about 1,000 tons each, all of which were purchased from the United States last year and are being held in custody by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The tanker company will initially take over three ships, which will be refurbished before sailing to Iran. It is understood that 80,000 tons have already been ordered from the American-Iranian oil company. The three tankers taken over will make their maiden voyage and are scheduled to depart in mid-month. In the future, the company will coordinate with the Ministry of Communications regarding the domestic oil transportation, providing convenience during transportation to achieve the goal of combined water and land transport, ensuring speed and safety along the way.</p>
<h3>American Industry Representatives Oppose Lowering Tariffs</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] Representatives of various American industries have expressed their opposition to the authorities' reduction of import tariffs on certain commodities or raw materials. They have provided numerous opinions for reference when the State Department conducts trade agreement negotiations in the future. Those who oppose tax cuts fear that government officials will use the power granted by the previous Congress to allow a 50% reduction in many existing tax rates. Representatives of paper manufacturers, textile merchants, chemical raw material companies, optical glass and glass sand manufacturers, and spokespersons for various other industries have personally provided opinions to State Department officials. Merchants selling imported goods and manufacturers using imported raw materials have proposed tax cuts. Economic scholars generally dare not speculate on the outcome of these tax cut proposals in the United States Congress, but Republicans hold a majority in the United States Congress for the first time in ten years. The current power to reduce taxes was granted to the President by a majority vote in Congress by the Democratic Party.</p>
<h3>Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Merchants Prohibited from Selling Untaxed Tin Foil</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Trade Association, citing telegram No. 00596 from the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, which stated that the sale of smuggled Shaoxing tin foil by soldiers and private individuals had been repeatedly reported to the Ministry of National Defense for thorough investigation and handling. As Shanghai is a major distribution area for smuggled Shaoxing tin foil, it is necessary to strengthen inspection work and dispatch capable personnel to key smuggling routes to work with the military and police to strictly intercept smugglers. The association is also strictly instructed to prohibit foil shops in the city from purchasing smuggled goods and to manage them properly to ensure effective enforcement. The Bureau had previously received confidential reports that some cigarette, soap, and candle merchants were purchasing and selling smuggled tin foil for profit. It had requested that the association be informed that they should not privately purchase untaxed tin foil in a letter (沪税字第4167号). Therefore, in light of the previous situation, in addition to dispatching capable personnel to work with the city's military and police to strictly intercept smugglers and strengthen inspections, this letter is being sent to the association, hoping that it will strictly restrain its members to abide by the regulations, eliminate the purchase of smuggled goods, and avoid violating the law and being prosecuted.

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Actively Restoring Pre-War Sugar Production</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is actively repairing sugar factories and railways in Taiwan in order to restore pre-war sugar production. Equipment needed to repair the railways has been ordered from the United States and is expected to be fully delivered between June and July this year. It is expected that all repairs will be completed and ready for use by November. It is understood that before the railways are repaired, sugarcane from the sugarcane-producing areas cannot be transported to the sugar factories for sugar production. Moreover, sugarcane takes two years to mature. During the Pacific War, sugarcane fields were severely damaged, resulting in a severe shortage of production. Therefore, the amount of sugar produced since the victory until the spring of last year was only 80,000 tons. The amount of sugar produced from last winter to this spring is only about 30,000 tons. Now that the fertilizer problem has been solved, the production of sugarcane is expected to gradually increase. It is estimated that after the railways are repaired by November this year, the amount of sugarcane transported will increase to 3 million tons, and the amount of sugar produced from this winter to next spring is expected to increase to 300,000 tons. If sugarcane production increases smoothly and the plan proceeds as desired, the company's annual sugar production is expected to reach 500,000 tons. According to reliable estimates, the current national consumption of sugar is 100,000 to 200,000 tons per year. If transportation is restored in the future, consumption will increase to 300,000 tons. Therefore, the sugar produced in Taiwan is sufficient to meet the national consumption and more. Currently, the company's sugar reserves in Taiwan are regularly maintained at around 120,000 tons. It is responsible for allocating 2,000 tons of sugar per month to the more than 7 million people in Taiwan Province. The company's sugar reserves in Shanghai are also regularly maintained at around 50,000 tons. Since the establishment of the Shanghai company in May last year, it has allocated about 50,000 tons of sugar. The Shanghai company allocates sugar every Thursday. Last year, a total of 29 allocations were made, and four allocations have already been made this year. The first allocation was 48,350 bags, the second was 9,050 bags, the third was 27,200 bags, and the fourth was 31,150 bags.</p>

<h3>Bartering Coarse Salt to Japan Will Not Affect Consumption</h3>
<p>Opinions Expressed by Responsible Person of China Trust</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chemical industry giant Li Zhuming telegraphed the Central Government on the 21st of last month, opposing the bartering of large quantities of coarse salt to Japan. He argued that Japan has always been self-sufficient in salt for its people's food, agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and mining. The current request for the supply of coarse salt is purely for the production of alkali. Providing it in large quantities would be tantamount to cultivating Japan's entire chemical industry. A reporter inquired about this matter with the Central Trust Bureau. According to a responsible person of the Bureau, while Mr. Li's opinion is not without merit, it is an exaggeration to say that providing coarse salt would cultivate Japan's entire chemical industry. We should pay attention to two points regarding this matter. First, our country barters coarse salt to Japan purely to exchange surplus salt for urgently needed goods from Japan. Therefore, supplying Japan with salt will definitely not affect our people's food and industry. Moreover, bartering must be carefully considered based on urgency and importance. Coarse salt is a surplus product in our country, while transportation equipment and industrial and mining equipment are urgently needed. Exchanging these for each other cannot be said to be ill-conceived. Second, Japan is currently under the control of the four powers, and everything is centrally planned. If the four powers do want to cultivate Japan's industry, then supplying coarse salt would also be part of the overall plan and cannot be said to be inappropriate. If the four powers do not want to cultivate Japan's industry, then this coarse salt will not be used to develop Japan's industry. Therefore, what we should pay attention to is the issue of Japanese control, and we do not need to be overly concerned about the quantity of goods bartered between China and Japan.</p>

<h3>Private Primary and Secondary Schools Advocate Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>75% of Tuition and Fees</p>
<p>The issue of tuition fees in private schools has recently attracted considerable attention from society. The person in charge of the board of directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation issued the following statement yesterday: This resolution from the principal's meeting, which passed a high tuition fee of 120,000 yuan for primary schools, 170,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 220,000 yuan for senior high schools, plus miscellaneous fees of up to 40,000 yuan for primary schools and up to 80,000 yuan for secondary schools, is truly a last resort due to the recent increase in the cost of living. It has been submitted to the Education Bureau for record-keeping. At a time when the social economy is exhausted, there are quite a few students from poor families, and the treatment of public school teachers is meager, so their children should also be given preferential treatment when enrolling. Therefore, methods for students to receive free or reduced tuition have been stipulated, the main points of which are: (1) Students applying for free or reduced tuition must have passing grades, be from poor families, and submit an application form. (2) Children of public school teachers can be exempted from half of the tuition, and those from poor families can be exempted entirely. (3) All schools must approve the applications of students in the above two categories. (4) If the number of free tuition slots exceeds 20% in primary schools and 15% in secondary schools, please request subsidies from the government. According to the third provision, all students from poor families who have passing grades can enjoy preferential treatment for reduced or free tuition. In areas with poorer economic conditions, tuition fees should be lower, and the number of free tuition slots should be more than in other areas. In order to maintain the economic balance of students, it is necessary to request subsidies from the government. Although the fourth provision has not yet been approved by the government, it is hoped that all schools will adhere to the spirit of "education for all" and expand the number of free tuition slots as much as possible, so that no student will be deprived of education due to the inability to pay tuition fees. As for students who are unable to pay tuition fees at once, the schools originally had a plan for installment payments. The allocation of school finances is in accordance with the regulations for primary and secondary schools and the orders of the Education Bureau, with 70% allocated to salaries for teachers and staff. In recent years, teachers have lived in poverty, and many schools have increased the salaries of teachers and staff to 75%, with some exceeding 80%. This semester, all schools should still adhere to the principle of 75%. Miscellaneous fees and tuition fees are combined for allocation, and finances are open to the public, which has been repeatedly resolved. Last semester, thanks to the hard work of teachers and the assistance of parents, the effectiveness of training and education in private schools in this city has improved, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide encouragement.</p>

<h3>School Building of Mingde Primary School Forcibly Occupied by Landlord</h3>
<p>The private Mingde Primary School was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. It was originally located on Xietu Road. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the original site could not be used for classes. In August of the 27th year, the entire downstairs of Gu Pingfang's house at 157 Yaozhu Road was rented as a school building. At that time, a two-year contract was signed. Later, both parties agreed not to sign a contract for a fixed period, and it became an indefinite lease. Since the school opened and classes have been held there, eight and a half years have passed. All has been well. Unexpectedly, late at night on the 28th of this month, the Gu landlord took advantage of the winter vacation when teachers and staff returned home and the school workers were asleep, and led a group of people to break into the premises, forcibly throwing desks and school supplies out of the classroom, tearing up the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the national flag, and arbitrarily moving his personal furniture into the classroom. The head of the school heard the news in the morning and went to negotiate, but was met with insults due to the disparity in numbers and strength. He reported the situation to the Xujiahui Branch of the competent police station, requesting an investigation into the truth and ordering the police to protect education and maintain public order. Currently, the classrooms, etc., are still forcibly occupied by the Gu landlord, and the head of the school is appealing to all sectors of society.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper] In the Group A football league, Longjie played against Jewish again at Yiyuan Stadium at 2:30 pm yesterday. There were more than 4,000 fans. It was quite lively. As a result of the battle, Jewish won Longjie with a score of five to one. In the first half, Jewish took the lead with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>Jewish Team Scores Successively</p>
<p>Longjie attacked first, and Jin Lusheng was first thanked for being hugged by McNiti, escaping the danger. Fan Shuai You Dehua had a tacit understanding with the two wings and attacked Longjie's hinterland. Zhao Yongfang blocked the way. Zhou Yongjiu escaped for a quarter of an hour. After 18 minutes, Mai Lvxi got the ball and passed it to the center. Edward went with the flow and went straight to Longjie's door. The foot was slightly worse and was passed to the left by the goalkeeper, but Que Bisiqi flew a kick on the cold road and made a contribution. One to zero, Jewish team opened the record first. Longjie lost a city painfully and joined forces to counterattack, but Jewish defense was extremely strict and did not take advantage of it. After 28 minutes, Edward re-entered and followed suit, but Que Siqi hurried to kick it again, scoring twice, two to zero, Longjie lost another city. At this point, Longjie's formation shook, and the hinterland was allowed to be ravaged by foreign soldiers. At the end of the first half, Jewish took the lead with two to zero.</p>
<p>Morale is Low, Longjie Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>In the second half, Longjie transferred troops and launched a large-scale attack. After seven minutes, Jin Lusheng went straight along the edge and stopped to hook. The landing point was excellent. Gu Dirong was about to rush to the goal. McNiti turned over like a pigeon and pounced on the ball. The camera was extremely exciting. Jewish Wuji Tailai saw rampant again. Edward went straight in with a single knife. Zhou Yongfang came to seize him head-on. Edward flew up his left foot and went like a meteor. Sheng Peter could not save him and dedicated another city. Three to zero, Jewish arrogance became more and more intense. Longjie's defenders were unusually hard. After 15 minutes, Gu Dirong had a chance to shoot, but it was too late. Xue Pan Siting flew to the left to clear the siege, but the ball happened to fall at the feet of Tao Tingfu, and he passed it to the center in one fell swoop. McNiti stepped forward slowly, intending to get the ball. Unexpectedly, Lin Shaojun killed him on the cold road and the top blossomed. Three to one, Longjie broke the duck egg, but the world was already set. Longjie's morale did not improve. After 20 minutes, Jewish Sitolun shot fiercely at the goal post and bounced back, but Que Bisiqi caught up with a kick and hit again, four to one. Longjie was fundamentally shaken and was taken advantage of by Baojie. As a result, it became a five-to-one situation. Longjie lost again and again. Zhou Yongfang was high-spirited and acted rudely. He deliberately fouled twice and was sent off the field. The two sides fought until the end of the game.</p>

<h3>Mourning the Tennis Artist Xu Chengji</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Xu Chengji, the tennis master who died of illness in London a few days ago, was the first Chinese athlete to show his power overseas. Mr. Xu is an overseas Chinese in Uwa, Java, Dutch East Indies. He is only thirty-four years old this year. He has been fond of tennis since he was a child, and his skills are quite impressive. He once won the All-Java tennis championship. On National Day in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the 5th National Games was held in the capital. Mr. Xu represented Batavia's overseas Chinese and returned to China to participate in the tennis tournament. Although the team was defeated by the Shanghai team in the semi-finals, Mr. Xu became an instant hit and maintained his undefeated record in individual events. In particular, his victory over the veteran Qiu Feihai was deeply appreciated by the audience. Mr. Xu was only twenty years old at the time.</p>
<p>First Time Participating in the Davis Cup</p>
<p>After returning to the south, Mr. Xu worked tirelessly and his ball skills progressed rapidly. Because he and Zheng Zhaojia were selected at the same time as representatives of China to attend the 1935 Davis Cup tennis tournament, unexpectedly, the first battle encountered a strong enemy, the United States. The main general of the United States was Boqi, who had won the Wimbledon World Tennis Singles Championship (Note: Boqi had already switched to professional tennis). Mr. Xu met a strong enemy for the first time, but he was still able to display his superb ball skills. The score was: four-six, one-six, eight-six, two-six. Mr. Xu failed but was still glorious.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Xu's technology advanced by leaps and bounds. The beauty Carson, who had held the Shanghai singles championship for several years, was determined to humiliate our country's players. Mr. Xu defeated her several times and won back honor for the Chinese people. In the 24th year, the 6th National Games was held in Shanghai. Mr. Xu still represented the Java region and attended the games. He won the National Tennis Singles Championship and cooperated with his younger brother Chengwei in doubles, winning the runner-up (Note: The champion was Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai group.), becoming China's first national player.</p>
<p>China participated in the 1936 Davis Cup tennis tournament, still attended by Mr. Xu and Mr. Zheng Zhaojia. As a result of the draw, they first met France, the overlord of the European region, and unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>In the 1937 Davis Cup tennis tournament, China's representatives were Mr. Xu and Cai Huiquan. They first met the New Zealand team. Mr. Xu won both singles games with his strength. Due to Cai's weakness, they were eventually eliminated with a score of two to three. However, international comments believed that the Chinese representatives' ball skills had improved significantly, and this was a "glorious failure." Mr. Xu was even listed as a world-class player.</p>
<p>Wimbledon Tennis Championships</p>
<p>In the same year, Mr. Xu participated in the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships for the first time and was selected as a seeded player. He won three consecutive singles games and reached the stage of the last thirty-two players. He advanced to the fourth week and lost to American master Mei Gu in a four-set drama. Mr. Xu also cooperated with Swedish player Xie Luote in doubles, and his record was not weak. In addition, Mr. Xu participated in various championships in various European countries and won nine championships in twelve games, defeating British and Italian first-class players Austin Stephen Hughes, etc. French celebrity Bulunong was also defeated by Mr. Xu twice in straight sets. Mr. Xu once participated in the Birmingham Catholic Church tennis tournament in the UK and won the championship for three consecutive years, and then was able to enjoy the championship forever.</p>
<p>The British Dunlop Rubber Company is a world-famous manufacturer. In addition to its car tires, which are famous internationally, the tennis balls it produces are sold overseas. The person in charge of the company, in view of Mr. Xu's widespread reputation, invited Mr. Xu to make a world tour to promote it. Mr. Xu was the first Chinese athlete to receive this honor.</p>
<p>The Sino-British Marriage is a Legend</p>
<p>On January 26th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu and Miss Qin Bao'erfu, a British tennis player, were married in London. The marriage of Chinese and British tennis celebrities was a legend for a while. Miss Bao'erfu's father once served as a judge in Ceylon.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Mr. Xu worked for Batavia's British Dunlop Rubber Company. After the Japanese invaded, he was imprisoned and neglected to practice. Last year, he was assigned to be a Davis Cup player in China. With a score of four to one, Denmark was eliminated in the preliminary round. Mr. Xu was the main player of our team. In the finals against Belgium, Mr. Xu took both singles games with his strength. Due to the weakness of his teammate Cai Huiquan, the result was a failure with a score of two to three. In last year's Wimbledon tennis tournament, Mr. Xu reached the third week before being eliminated.</p>
<p>According to tennis experts, Mr. Xu is unanimously recognized as a world-class player, but due to physical limitations, he cannot create a more complete record.</p>
<p>Meritorious Sports Ambassador</p>
<p>Mr. Xu was at a young and promising age, and the Chinese people had deep expectations for him. The bad news came, and people were extremely shocked!</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Xu gave a speech to a reporter from the Associated Press in London, explaining the shortcomings of the tennis world in our country. It is a lack of new talents. He said, "Our biggest need is new equipment. For many years, there has been no real grass tennis court in Shanghai. We even have to use old balls and discarded rackets for matches." This last word, at least, the person in charge of the sports authorities in our country should remember!</p>
<p>Mr. Xu has left us, but the glory he has earned for China will never be forgotten by every compatriot. We must use the most meaningful actions to commemorate this meritorious "sports ambassador", not tears, no wreaths, we should find ways to create and produce a second Xu Chengji!</p>

<h3>Tiger Head - Snow Exploration</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Nanjing, January 31st, Quick Report</p>
<p>Zhou Ni Fohai, pre-signed "Ten Years Later, Zhen Zhiwo", "and Made a Submission"</p>
<p>Luo Ni Junqiang, self-proclaimed as "Spokesman", talks about "Political Rest"</p>
<p>On the day when Chang Zhou Ni Fohai was sentenced to death, the reporter climbed onto the prison car to visit Zhou Ni when he was being escorted back to Tiger Bridge Prison. At that time, he sighed and said, "My death was destined on the day General Dai Yunong died. Today's judgment in the Great Success Hall is just a public announcement, and of course there is nothing rare." With the mood of "Fate is doomed, I don't know me", and signed the seven characters "Ten Years Later, Zhen Zhiwo", this can also be said that a person is about to die, its appropriate also "sad" bar!</p>
<h3>A Paper Submission in Illness - Lamenting That Wangdao Cannot be Separated from Human Feelings</h3>
<p>One afternoon, with clear weather and the sun about to set, stepping on the muddy road after the melting snow, I walked into the Tiger Bridge High Court Detention Center, took out the card, and met Director Wan, explaining the intention of visiting Zhou Ni Fohai. After Director Wan asked Zhao Dean for instructions, he agreed in general. When the reporter entered the detention center, the prison doctor Wen Fengnian was diagnosing Zhou Ni's illness, using a 100CC syringe to inject a special injection for heart failure. After half an hour, the medicine was completely injected into the muscles. According to Dr. Wen told the reporter: Zhou's life is difficult to preserve, and death is possible at any time. Ordinary people breathe 26 to 32 times, and the pulse has reached a maximum of 132 times, and a minimum of 98 times, with "stoppages" sooner or later. The current injection is just to maintain the status quo. Since the disease is so serious, it is impossible to meet and talk. Instead, he was seen crouching in the quilt from that narrow rectangular hole, looking very desolate.</p>
<p>A prison officer told the reporter: Yesterday morning, Zhou Ni used Western-style letter paper to personally write a submission, saying: "I have been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court, and the execution will be sooner or later. I have long put my personal life and death aside, but I cannot but comfort my family. Wangdao is nothing more than human feelings, and I beg you not to limit the date and number of meetings with my family, I am very grateful." The following signed "Zhou Fohai" three characters, which was personally presented by himself. After the reporter inquired, this request for "Wang these are nothing more than human feelings" is still placed under the glass plate of the director's desk. Although it has not been officially promised, it always gives him more convenience. So these days, his wife Yang Shu is certainly going to meet him one after another. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00, his wife and his daughter Hai went to meet him again, but Zhou unexpectedly complained a lot. "What are you doing here? What else can you talk about? Hurry back for me, I know everything myself, you don't need to worry!" His wife heard the scolding and cried non-stop. Hai was also crying bitterly beside him. Zhou Ni quickly said, "What's the use of crying? I don't care about dying, you go!" Speaking of this, "Although Zhou Ni was calm, he could not help but show his love for his children and shed two lines of tears." Chen, the prison officer, also told the reporter that when he was first taken in, his temper was extremely presumptuous, and no one could suppress him, but recently he has been much more peaceful.</p>
<h3>Luo Junqiang Self-Proclaimed as Spokesman - Peanuts Treat Reporters</h3>
<p>Since Zhou Ni is already in a terminal illness, and the visit is useless, did the reporter come here for nothing? Then, visiting the next Ding Ni Mocun Luo Ni Junqiang is naturally the goal of the visit. The reporter stood in front of Gate No. 4, Zhou Fohai's shop was on the right, Luo Junqiang's shop was on the left, and Mo Cun's shop was facing the gate. When Ding Ni spoke, he always let out a treacherous laugh of "Haha". Luo Junqiang stated in a clownish posture: "You want to see Zhou Fohai, I can represent him. If you have anything to ask, ask me. I used to be Mr. Zhou's Secretary-General, and now I am still the Secretary-General. We have been together for more than a year, and we have talked about everything we want to talk about. And I can guarantee that there is no secret at all. I am the spokesman of No. 4, every sentence is loyal and will never lie." Seeing that the reporter had not had time to ask, he said a preface first: "We spend the whole day here chatting and reading books. Mr. Zhou mostly reads foreign magazines." Luo Ni also said that being in prison is a "pleasant" thing. After using "political brains" for decades, it is good to have a chance to "rest" at this time. However, it seems "sad" in spirit. Speaking of this, he also took a square tea iron can of Taipingchun from the side of the shop, poured out a pile of Qingdao peanuts and said to the reporter: "Today is my very simple execution, next time you come, I will execute you in the same way." He laughed very proudly, and he also told the reporter: "My wife sends me food every day, so life is not hard." The reporter took the opportunity to ridicule and said: "Husband and wife were originally birds in the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes." Then, your wife is very good: "That is "disaster strikes in a pile". He laughed, and the reporter chased after him and said, "The three words in a pile are not very good!" He was busy adding the two words "spirit".</p>
<h3>Ding Mocun Feels He Has Nothing to Say: "Already Lost Gambling Capital"</h3>
<p>At this moment, Ding Di approached, bringing with him a tone of "repentance," saying, "I am indeed a character who has lost his gambling capital. What is there to say now?"</p>
<p>Finally, the traitor Luo wrote two poems: "Fallen blossoms are not heartless things; they turn into spring mud to nourish the flowers," and "Renouncing worldly affairs and finding fame in the mountains is fortunately achieved early; what other method could I leave for this life?" In the letter slot near the bed where the traitor Zhou slept, the reporter discovered a string of one hundred and eight Buddhist beads, and immediately asked, "Does Zhou Fohai recite Buddhist scriptures?" The traitor Luo said, "His wife gave them to him." At the same time, there was also a copy of the "Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra" in the letter slot. The conversation lasted for quite some time, about forty-five minutes. Walking out of the detention center, the electric lights on both sides of the road had already lit up, and the cold wind was still blowing fiercely.</p>

<h3>Land of Ziyang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Yu Ning Po</p>
<p>Wuyuan, 18th Day</p>
<p>Encroaching on three hundred miles of Hui and Rao, equally dividing the sources of Wu and Chu;</p>
<p>White clouds have feet, uniting heaven and earth; distant waters are waveless, reflecting the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Ming Dynasty Wang Xun's poem on Zhang Mountain</p>
<p>The above poem expresses the height and greatness of Zhang Mountain, straddling the Wu and Chu dynasties. It not only serves as an outer barrier for southern Anhui but also nurtures many specialties and the scholarly atmosphere of Ziyang culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps many people are unfamiliar with the name Wuyuan County. Today, the reporter might as well provide a detailed introduction to this place's mountains, waters, people, products, transportation, and other aspects:</p>
<p>Wuyuan is located on the border of southern Anhui and northern Jiangxi. It is the hometown of Zhu Xi, the master of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism, and the late railway engineering master Zhan Tianyou (styled Chuncheng). It used to be under the jurisdiction of the old Huizhou Prefecture in Anhui Province. In the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], it was placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province to facilitate bandit suppression. Surrounded by towering mountains, both the county seat and the villages and towns are tightly embraced by green mountains. The Suhang area has many water towns, but this place is the opposite, with more mountains than water, fully demonstrating the characteristics of benevolence and longevity. Residents mostly engage in farming and trade. The houses in the villages are mostly built of brick, rich in splendor and antiquity. Each village, surrounded by green water and green mountains, has extremely secluded and beautiful scenery. However, each village inevitably shares its space with farmers. The houses of farmers, merchants, and gentry are like a mixture of three-part soil. Therefore, it does not lack the same elements of beauty and ugliness as other places.</p>
<p>Mountainous Transportation, More Land than Water</p>
<p>Wuyuan is located in the upper reaches of the Poyang Le River and is also the source of the Qianpei and Xin'an Rivers. These are all waterfalls from Zhelong in the north of the county, dividing into north and south streams. Therefore, this mountain is also called Zheyuan Mountain, which is historical proof that the Zhe River originates here.</p>
<p>The entire territory has only two major rivers in the northeast. One originates from Tan Gongling in the eastern township, passes through Jiangwan, Wangkou, Cikeng, and reaches Wukou, a total length of sixty-five li. The other originates from Zheyuan Mountain and Dadu Mountain in the northern township, passes through Shicun, Mangguan, Fengshan, Luowen, Qinghua, Longteng, Sikou, and reaches Wukou, a total length of one hundred li. From Wukou, the two northeastern rivers converge, pass through the county seat, Taibai, and Xincun, and enter Dexing, with a total length of more than one hundred li. This is the main route for Wuyuan to directly reach the Le River and Poyang, facilitating water transportation. Boats can pass through both rivers; the northern river reaches Qinghua from the county seat, and the eastern river reaches Jiangwan from the county seat. The southwestern regions are mostly creeks that can be crossed with a single reed.</p>
<p>The land and water transportation in all four directions is connected to Xiuning and Qimen in Anhui to the north, Kaihua and Changshan in Zhejiang to the east, Dexing and Leping in Jiangxi to the south, and Fuliang and Jingdezhen to the west. Except for the Dexing-Leping route, which is navigable, all other routes are dry roads. The thoroughfares within the territory are all paved with complete bluestone, exceptionally wide and flat. The famous educator Huang Yanpei once visited this place and praised it as a great road construction project, rarely seen in the country.</p>
<p>After the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the highways built in this county and neighboring areas include the Jing (Dezhen) Wuyuan Hua (Bu) in Zhejiang Province, the Wuyuan Shuai, and the Xing (Guo) Wuyuan Tun (Xi) (Anhui Province), and the (Xi) Wuyuan. During the War of Resistance against Japan, these lines were dismantled due to military reasons. In the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], because many goods from the inland of Jiangxi Province were transferred through Hekou and Tunxi, a handcart toll of one cent was charged from Hekou directly to Tunxi through this area. However, this route has never been used by vehicles after its opening. Now, it is overgrown with weeds and covered with sand and stones, becoming a slippery and difficult shortcut.</p>

<h3>Beautiful Mountains and Waters, Endless Artistic Inspiration</h3>
<p>There is no place in Wuyuan without green mountains. This statement accurately reflects Wuyuan's identity. Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, and the scenery here is similar. The mountains in Sichuan are numerous, tall, and sturdy, with dangerous and rugged shapes. The mountains here are not as high but more gentle and beautiful, with mist-covered peaks and endless artistic inspiration. Moreover, there are green mountains everywhere, with green water surrounding them. The joy of benevolence and wisdom is available for appreciation. In spring, the pines are verdant, and the mountain flowers bloom vividly. In summer, the halls open to the green fields, and a cool breeze arises. In autumn, the green streams and red trees are perfect for setting a small boat adrift. In winter, there are wax-like elephants and silver snakes, and solitary fishing on the cold river. The scenery is different in the four seasons, and the joy is endless.</p>
<p>The above four seasons are the general scenery of this place. The most prominent and outstanding scenery includes the clouds covering the sea at Gaohu Mountain, the view of Poyang Lake from Zhang Mountain, the wondrous scenery and fairy traces in Lingyan Cave, the Shao She Terrace in Fengshuitan, the Immortal Cow gazing at the moon in Dongbin Temple, the auspicious clouds over Hongbing in Zhu Zi's hometown, the jade belt waterfall in Zheyuan Mountain, the embroidered water and autumn waves in Xitouxi, the Longxi Pavilion in Changtan Village, the arrowhead cliff in Hongyuan Village, the mirror reflection in Furong Peak, the high pool of Shixia, the snow appreciation in Tianxiang Pavilion, the cloud viewing in Shi'erguan, the nine bends of Yanyuan, and the hundred-li flower bridge. These are all scenic lines of Wuyuan, either famous for their people, secluded, or shaped like objects, or outstanding and supernatural, containing wonders and beauty, each with its own natural beauty.</p>
<p>The Qingguang of the Current Affairs Daily News, which carries people to travel in Guangxi, brings all beautiful mountains and rivers, making people fascinated. If Mr. Wang Jiyuan were to travel here, the reporter would expect that what he brings back would be no less than what he gained in western Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Three Treasures of Local Products: Tea, Fish, Inkstone</h3>
<p>A product called a treasure naturally has differences from products of the same kind. I will write about them below to show the advantages of the word "treasure."</p>
<p>Zhang Mountain Cloud Mist Tea</p>
<p>The name of the tea is Cloud Mist, so its value is known. About seventy li from the county seat in the vicinity of Jihe Township in the north of the county, there is a great mountain called Da Zhang Mountain, which surrounds several tens of li, spanning the three counties of Fuliang, Xiuning, and Wuyuan. The broad and lush greenery is as high as the clouds. Tea trees are planted on the plains on the top of the mountain and on the slopes, and the annual output is huge, which is a major source of income for mountain farmers. The tea produced in the mountains is very different from the tea in other places. The leaf surface is pure green, and the back is light yellow. One leaf clearly shows two colors. Each leaf is covered with small holes like transparent gauze, but none of them are pierced through. When drinking, use boiling water to brew it. The tea infusion is slow to come out. Although the color is clear and not green, the taste is especially sweet, rich, and mellow. Taking one leaf of Zhang tea and comparing it with a pinch of tea from other places, the taste can be slightly better with less. Compared with Longjing in Zhejiang and Wuyi in Fujian, it is no less. The most precious of the Zhang Mountain tea is the Cloud Mist Tea on the cliffs of Bagua Peak. Because the mountain peaks are like Lushan, whose true faces are not seen for years, and are often shrouded in clouds and mist, the tea industry is full of the fresh air of dew and mist, so the leaf body is thick and white, showing silver hairs, and the taste is bitter and deep with a faint fragrance. When brewing in a teapot with boiling water, cover it for a while. When opened, a stream of white air rises, circling like clouds. The tea is named Cloud Mist, hence the name. This tea is very rare in production, and only a few are grown on the cliff waist. Mountain people picking tea leaves are like the people of Borneo picking swallow nests. They use long ropes to tie wooden chairs, and two people pull the ropes from the ends. People sit on the chairs and are slowly lowered from the top of the cliff. At the tea spot, they pick and prune the branches, and after harvesting and roasting the leaves, they only get about a catty of tea. They pack it carefully and give it to good friends. The rarity of the material makes it precious and worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Longxi Peach Blossom Fish</p>
<p>The fish is named Peach Blossom, which can be as endearing as the vegetable name "red in snow." This fish is produced in the Longteng River in the northern township of this place. The fish is less than an inch long, with a large head and a round body. Because it has several red lines on its belly, resembling peach blossoms, it is named Peach Blossom Fish. Every year in early spring, when the apricots bloom and the peach blossoms are budding but not yet in bloom, the fish gather in groups in the shallow waters between the sand and rocks, scattering and hatching with the waves. Because of its small body, it is invisible when viewed from afar. At this time, fishermen tie grass nets and drag them along the sand. They fish all day long and get at most a few ounces of fish. Then, they bake them dry with gentle heat and store them in tin utensils. After a certain number of days, wait for the heat to subside and soften, take it and soak it in a little soy sauce, and the taste is surprisingly fresh and delicious. It can eliminate food and stimulate the appetite.</p>
<p>There are two places where Peach Blossom fish are produced: one is Longteng in the northern township, and the other is Wangkou in the eastern township. Both villages belong to the Yu family, but Longteng is superior to Wangkou. The most peculiar thing is that the fishing period for this fish is at most ten days. After this, there will be no harvest. This is because the fish gather in groups when the peach blossoms are budding. When the flowers bloom, they scatter when they see people.</p>
<p>Wuxi Longwei Inkstone</p>
<p>The inkstone is a kind of mineral. The Yellow Emperor used jade as an inkstone sea, which is well known to the world. There is not just one kind of inkstone material. There are crystal inkstones, iron inkstones, copper inkstones, magnetic inkstones, bamboo inkstones, and other kinds of names. Among the inkstone materials in our country, the Duan stone from Zhaoqing, the She stone from Huizhou, and the Cheng mud from Haozhou are the most suitable. Since then, the Duan, She, and Cheng inkstones have become popular in the world, especially the Longwei stone of the She inkstone is the most precious.</p>
<p>The world only knows that She inkstone is produced in She County, Huizhou, but they don't know that it is produced in Longwei Mountain in Wuxi, eastern township of Wuyuan. The hermit Ougeng, a native of Xin'an, said in his bamboo branch poem: "The inkstone is named She, but She does not have it. The Longwei Mountain source is in Wuxi. The mountain originally belongs to Zheng Prefecture and governs She. The inkstone is still named She: the name is confusing." Looking at this poem, it is enough to prove the origin of the inkstone. Su Dongpo's Song of Longwei Inkstone said: "Yellow jade and white amber, heaven does not cherish, but fears that greedy men will die with a piece of jade in their arms. Look at Longwei, isn't it an inkstone material? Jade listens to the golden sound, dwelling in stone. Making stone with heaven has not been long, making inkstone with man has not been long. What does Bao and Xie's poetry have to do with stone? The pen drops, and Zhong and Wang's inkstone knows nothing. The brocade fungus and jade box are covered with dirt. What about the practice of supporting the bed with a branch? Moreover, how can Su Zi's Phoenix Pearl inscription be compared to the playful words made after the cow? The blue sky shines on the water, and the wind blows the clouds. The bright window and large desk are clean and free of dust. I was born between heaven and earth as an idle object. Su Zi is also a shattered person. Grouped words and fine words are not chosen. Spring worms and autumn snakes are painted at will. I wish to follow Su Zi to old Dongpo. The benevolent do not need to create distinctions." Old Su's song again proves the preciousness of She inkstone. Wuyuan produces inkstone in fourteen pits: (1) Longwei Mountain, (2) Luowen Mountain, (3) Meizi Pit, (4) Jinxing Pit, (5) Bili Pit, (6) Shuixian Pit, (7) Shui Jue Pit, (8) Xitou Pit, (9) Ye Jiu Pit, (10) Lu Pit, (11) Jiyuan Pit, (12) Lingyan Pit, (13) Mashi, (14) Zaoxin. There are three grades of inkstone stone: (1) Longwei, (2) Luowen, (3) Meizi. The stone quality of these three kinds of inkstones is generally strong, lustrous, and good at producing ink. It is more expensive if it has gold stars and the spots are bright and distinct, shining like gold powder. The best is shaped like a dragon's tail, called the Longwei Jinxing. The next best is scattered like flowers and plants. Inkstones with gold stars are generally green. In addition to the gold stars, other patterns are like reed flowers, or like woven silk, or like eyebrows, or like brush threads. The patterns are all white, vaguely like silver. The above inkstones are all moist, clean, and delicate, can store water without losing it, produce ink like oil without sound, stop the ink and float, protect the brush and increase its beauty, and the sharpness does not dull after long use. Scholars all cherish it.</p>
<p>The Longwei inkstone was opened in the Southern Tang Dynasty and closed in the Northern Song Dynasty. According to ancient legends: When opening the pit to take the inkstone, the county magistrate diverted the stream to absorb all the water to take it. Most of the ones that were harvested were of the highest quality. The magistrate ordered the villagers to confuse the wind forever and then directed the stream back to its original path, so the water was too deep to recover. After many years, the mines have disappeared. In the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], Chen Diaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the five-province preparatory army for bandit suppression, was stationed in Wuyuan. Hearing that the local area produced inkstones, he searched for the oldest people in the village, inquired about the source of the inkstones, and offered 2,000 yuan in cash, ordering them to explore the source. In the end, they found nothing.</p>
<p>A worldly rare treasure of civilization has been buried underground for a long time, not for the use of the world, which makes people feel the same way as Li Guang!</p>

<h3>Modern Gold Rush: Special Plane Crashes in Hong Kong, Gold Scattered All Over the Mountain</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zi Jian</p>
<p>Hong Kong, January 26th Air News</p>
<p>Over the past month, the "disaster star" of aviation has appeared above major airports around the world. As this "disaster star" circled the earth, it passed over Hong Kong several times. Shanghai station had an accident first, and the Philippine station had an accident later. Hong Kong people were full of the thought that "luck" was on their side and they might be able to escape the great calamity. Unexpectedly, the "disaster star" came again and again, and the Hong Kong airport was inevitably listed as one of the disaster-stricken places in the world: a special plane carrying gold worth one and a half million US dollars came to Hong Kong from the Philippines on the 25th. When it was only separated by a high mountain and could see the Kai Tak Airport, the clouds and fog obscured the vision, so it crashed into the mountain. As a result, gold coins flew with the sky, the plane caught fire, and the crew died. The "disaster star" left Hong Kong with a contented smile.</p>
<p>In today's world where the world is plunged into "aviation disasters," another plane crash naturally deepens the stimulation of human nerves. It just so happens that this plane was not carrying passengers, but weighed two and a half tons and was divided into more than fifty boxes of golden and white objects. In a society where human life is like grass, it seems to be even more shocking. The deaths of those four crew members can truly be considered "dying for gold"!</p>
<p>That was a C-47 transport plane. Before coming to Hong Kong, it had already had an accident in northern Philippines, but luckily it landed safely. However, those gold coins seemed to attract heaven's jealousy. A special "disaster star" was sent to follow it, determined to "get it" and then be happy. Therefore, when it approached its final destination, it was difficult to escape the calamity. The weather on the 25th was clear and bright in the morning, and the air was clear. It happened to be the fourth day of the first lunar month, and there were many tourists in Hong Kong, which was very lively. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, dark clouds blew in from outside the sky, and the air pressure dropped suddenly. Before long, clouds and fog piled up on the mountain, and drizzle fell. At this time, the "disaster star" appeared over Hong Kong. The gold-carrying plane of the Philippine Airlines just happened to fly near Shau Kei Wan in eastern Hong Kong. The "disaster star" cast its spell, and the smoke and fog were hazy. The pilot's vision was lost. In the blink of an eye, (2:02 p.m.) the plane crashed straight into the mountain, which was 1,734 feet above sea level! The point where the plane collided was only 50 feet away from the mountain peak. If it had been flying a little higher at the time, this misfortune might have been avoided.</p>
<p>After the plane crashed, it was impossible to find out where it fell that night due to the bad weather. It was not discovered until about 9 a.m. on the 26th. Therefore, police officers and bank magnates rushed to the accident site by car. The gold carried by the plane was worth 15 million US dollars, valued at 60 million Hong Kong dollars. However, one said it was only worth 20 million French currency. According to the investigation, it is known that it belonged to the Shanghai HSBC Bank, Belgian Bank, Chase Bank, American Express Bank, Bank of East Asia, Salt Industry Bank, and Bank of Communications. In addition, a part belonged to a few merchants. After a close search by the police, two-thirds of the gold has been recovered. It is said that some of the gold coins were scattered in the sky when the plane exploded, and some of the gold bars were melted by the fire. Continuing the search may lead to further discoveries. Readers, close your eyes and imagine: a mountain is covered with gold coins, some people are concentrating on digging beside it, some people are holding short guns and watching beside it, some people are worried about calculating the search results, and outside of the living, there are half of the wreckage of the plane, four unfortunate "dying for gold" people burned black. What a scene that is! That is "gold" and not "people." Why did they "send their lives" to Hong Kong in such bad weather? That explanation reveals a corner of the irrational phenomenon of this society! On the same day, the China Airlines plane flying from Hong Kong to Chongqing had another accident, but it was carrying "people," not "gold," so the public's reaction to it seemed much fainter!</p>

<h3>WEEKLY FORUM MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE XISHA ISLANDS</h3>
<p>— Huang Qiang</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have reported that the Chinese and French authorities are in dispute over the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands. After our country recovered them from the Japanese, French warships sent troops to land, which is both bizarre and serious. I served in Qiongyai three times in the years 1921, 1928-29, and 1936-37, and I know a lot about the situation of these islands. I will outline it below to inform the people of our country:</p>
<p>(1) The History of the Xisha Islands and the Japanese Management: The islands are our country's southernmost territory, and they are recorded in history books and annals. They have long been a place for fishermen from Hainan Island to fish. There is a lonely soul temple on Wushang Island, which was built by them, and its age cannot be determined. In 1921, Ikeda, the director of the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau, and others, used He Ruinian in the name of the Xisha Islands Industrial Company to secretly request the government to handle various matters such as reclamation, mining, and fisheries on the Xisha Islands, and ordered the Yai County to issue a land reclamation certificate. At the same time, they also applied for Fushui Island outside Changjiang Port to start fishing and reclamation. In fact, the operator was the Nanxing Industrial Company organized by the Japanese. Due to opposition from all parties, the original case was revoked in the spring of 1928. At that time, I was the Chief of Staff of the Guangdong Southern District Rehabilitation Office. Because the case had been revoked, it was urgent to continue the operation, so in May, I submitted a request to the provincial government to send the Hairui warship to conduct an investigation, and the county prepared all the business. In addition to sending several surveyors from the Rehabilitation Office, the Guangdong Construction Department sent a technician, and Zhongshan University sent a professor, etc., a total of more than 20 people, to the islands to conduct investigations and designs. According to their subsequent investigation, a Japanese diary was found on Lin Island, which showed that Taiwanese and Ryukyuans had died on the island as early as 1919. The company had laid wreaths to commemorate them on July 14, 1925, which clearly recorded the matter. It can be seen that the Japanese had been managing Xisha Islands for a total of nine years. In addition to the lonely soul temple built by Hainan fishermen on the island, which is six feet high, there are also buildings built by the Japanese, including an office and living room for managers in the southwest corner of Lin Island, which is 63 feet wide and 18 feet deep. Behind the office is a food and sundries storage room, which is 66 feet wide and 24 feet deep. To the left of the office is a small shop, which is 24 feet wide and 12 feet deep. To the left of the small shop are two workers' dormitories, which are L-shaped, each 90 feet long and 15 feet wide. In front of the dormitory is a workers' dining hall, which is 48 feet long and 15 feet wide. In front of the small shop is a cooking room, which is 30 feet long and 18 feet deep. Nearby is a kitchen, which is 20 feet long and 12 feet deep. Next to it is a well, with a water pump installed next to the well, and a huge water pipe connecting to the water storage pool behind the office and the pump in front. There are four water storage pools of different sizes for storing rainwater. The small pools are made of old iron plates, about four or five square feet. The large pools are made of cement, each 12 feet long and wide, and 6 feet high. When it rains, the water from the roofs of all the houses flows into the pools. The distiller is installed on the beach, and behind the machine is an iron workshop, which is 24 feet wide and 12 feet deep. The roofs and walls of the buildings are made of zinc sheets, and some are made of wood or branches. In addition, there is a chicken farm on the left side of the storage room, and a warehouse on the right side, which is 228 feet long and 48 feet wide. There are still 1,500 tons of island guano stored in it. There are also several cans of machine oil stored in the forest dozens of feet away. In addition to the factory buildings, there is also a light railway five miles long, with several branches along the southeast coast into the forest. The main line passes through the warehouse to the iron bridge of the dock. The length of the iron bridge is more than 1,250 feet, the width is 10 feet, and the height is about 17-18 feet. The horizontal wooden beams of the bridge deck are all made of American redwood, a total of 629 pieces. As for the items left on the island, there are two electric boats, two large and small barges each. Stored in the storage room and workers' dormitory, there are dozens of hoes, more than 100 bundles of bamboo baskets, dozens of large-mesh iron sieves, dozens of trolleys, dozens of large rattan baskets, dozens of bamboo hats, more than 100 pairs of straw sandals, about 100 bags of cement, and several cans of carbonized fuel. The blacksmith's tools and kitchen utensils are generally in good condition. It can be said that the Japanese worked hard to manage Lin Island, and all kinds of facilities are very complete, such as offices, storage rooms, dormitories, dining halls, warehouses, railways, freight yards, bridges, wooden boats, electric boats, trolleys, rattan baskets for transportation, hoes, baskets, nets and sieves for mining, all are complete. There are water storage pools, distilleries, wells and springs to supply drinking water, food storage rooms, pigsties, chicken coops, fishing boats and vegetable gardens for food, a small shop to supply daily necessities, and a doctor to treat diseases, so they can operate safely for several years and pack up and leave.</p>
<p>(2) The Value of Island Products: Our country's territory in the tropics is only this small area of more than ten miles. It is known that guano fossils must be produced in the tropics, so the phosphate ore in the Xisha Islands can be said to be the only product in our country's territory. Our country is based on agriculture, and this natural fertilizer is of great benefit. In addition, coral reef stones can be used as lime and transported to the mainland for construction and soil improvement, which is widely used, and the rich marine products are gathered in one place, which should have great business value.</p>
<p>(3) The Situation After 1928: After this investigation, a plan was drawn up to operate mining and fishing, and it was decided to set up a meteorological station and a lighthouse as soon as possible. Later, due to the Guangdong coup, the central government could not intervene, and Guangdong Province had no time to take care of it, so it was abandoned. In 1936, after the unification of the southwest, the French government, fearing that the South Pacific would be occupied by the Japanese due to the rampant encroachment of Japan in Northeast and North China, used the "Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi" in the history of Annam as an excuse, which stated that a certain emperor had sent people to Huangsha Island to establish successors and fish, and demanded that our country cede the islands to them. Our government naturally refused according to reason. In 1939, when China and Japan were in the midst of a fierce battle, France sent troops to occupy them. When the European war broke out, France was defeated, and Japan took over. It is not necessary to discuss whether Huangsha Island is the Xisha Islands, and how can a few words be considered Annam territory? The Japanese applied to our government for mining, reclamation, and fishing on the island, instead of applying to the Vietnamese authorities, which is ironclad evidence in the international community that it belongs to our country's territory. Moreover, before and after the Japanese undertook the project, the French government did not say a word. It was not until 1936 that they proposed it to our government. It is speculated that their initial intention was, as mentioned above, due to the South Pacific security issue, knowing that our country could not defend it, so their occupation could make Japan afraid to act rashly and prevent it from taking it by force. However, when the European war broke out, they could not protect it either, and it was finally taken away by the Japanese. Today, we have recovered our original land from the Japanese, which is really a matter of course. The French's unwarranted contention is something we never dreamed of.</p>
<p>(4) The Xisha Islands and Our National Defense: Our country's rejuvenated navy must of course use Yulin Port on Hainan Island as one of its naval ports. The Xisha Islands are a barrier to Yulin, and can also be said to be the outpost of the navy. In the event of a Pacific war, they can also be used as a base for submarines. The sea area at the eastern end of the islands is also an important route for ships traveling between China, Japan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(5) The Location and Topography of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are located between 15 degrees 46 minutes and 17 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, and 110 degrees 14 minutes and 112 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, about 145 miles southeast of Yulin Port in Hainan. They are the southernmost territory of our country, starting from Beisha Island in the north, ending at Nanji Island in the south, bounded by Linkang Island in the east, and connected to the Qizhou Ocean in the west. There are more than 20 islands, reefs, and beaches of various sizes, scattered on the sea surface, covering an area of about 200 square miles. They are a group of low islands formed by coral reefs, which the Westerners collectively call Paracels. The eastern area is called Amphitrite by Westerners, and the western area is called Chroissant. The islands are mostly ring-shaped or elliptical. The larger ones are dozens of square miles, and the smaller ones are less than one-tenth of a square mile. The area of Lin Island is 1,500,100 square meters, Shidao Island is smaller, with an area of 68,750 square meters, Dengjinyu Island has an area of 432,500 square meters, and the area of Qundao Island is also small, with an area of 76,250 square meters. Among the famous islands, Shidao Island is the highest above sea level, about 15 meters high, and the others are only a few meters high. The tops of the islands are all relics of coral and other animals. The edges are higher, and the middle is lower, like the inner basin of ordinary coral reefs. There is also a small lake in Dengjin Island. These are the conditions that have been surveyed on each island.</p>
<p>(6) The Geology and Soil of the Xisha Islands: The Dingsha Islands are composed of coral polyps and other animal remains. In the past, the sea level was higher, and corals formed ring-shaped reefs in the water. As the sea level dropped, the reefs were exposed to the sea surface, and the corals died away from the water, thus forming the shape of today's islands. Other various mollusks, such as cephalopods, gastropods, and bivalves, as well as echinoderms such as sea cucumbers and sea lilies, and crustaceans, are all part of the composition of the islands. In addition to the hard coral remains and various shells, there are only guano and guano fossils accumulated on the islands, which are gray on the surface and millet-colored inside. This is the so-called phosphate ore. The soil in the islands is all formed by the weathering of coral and shells, so it is mostly fine sandy soil and gravelly sandy soil. At first glance, it looks like quartz, but it is actually the debris of coral and shells weathered. It contains a lot of lime and is rich in salt. For example, the water in the small lake in the eastern part of Tangwu and the well water under the coconut trees in the south are salty. The pineapples and coconuts on Lin Island also have little sweetness, which are all proofs that the soil contains salt. Lin Island is a gathering place for birds, and the soil contains the most bird droppings. Generally speaking, the trees and forests on each island have been growing for many years, and their roots, stems, branches and leaves have rotted into humus everywhere. Therefore, the soil on Gu Island, except for the barren white sand accumulated by the sea, is dark brown and black between the forest land and grassland, and is unusually soft and fertile.</p>
<p>(7) The Climate and Sea Currents of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are located in the middle of the tropics, with a hot climate. The lowest temperature on the thermometer is above 70 degrees. It is generally a marine climate, with no severe cold or heat throughout the year. However, the direct sunlight at noon makes the temperature higher. There are often showers throughout the year, with mostly southerly winds. The temperature difference between 6:00 am and 2:00 pm in a day is often more than ten degrees. The average temperature in January, the coldest period of the year, is above 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average temperature in summer, the hottest period, is between 80 and 90 degrees. The air pressure is high and the wind is strong in winter, and the air pressure is low and the wind is gentle in summer and autumn. This is based on observations on Lin Island. The rest is not very detailed, but it can also be known in general. The sea currents along the coast of the South China Sea cannot be uniform due to the depth of the ocean, changes in air pressure, and differences in wind direction. The frequency of their occurrence is also quite different. The sea currents in the Xisha Islands are irregular and often change with the wind direction. The southwest water flow caused by the northeast wind from October to the end of April is larger and more constant than the northeast water flow caused by the southwest wind from May to October. The speed of the water flow is the fastest in December and January, with a speed of one nautical mile to one and a half nautical miles. The water flow in the middle of the islands is also different from the east and west sides. Near Lin Island and Shiwu on the east side, there is often a water flow from west to northwest, with a speed of two nautical miles, and there is also a very slow water flow from the east. Near Ganquan Island and Jinyin Island on the west side, there is also often a water flow from west or northwest, and there is also a northeast water flow from time to time. The complexity of this is due to the location relationship and the uncertain wind direction, which causes this irregular phenomenon.</p>
<p>(8) Transportation and Products of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are still in the South China Sea. The area east of Linkang Island is an important defense line for navigation between Hong Kong and the South Seas Islands. The area west of Jinyin Island is a thoroughfare for transportation between Annam and Hong Kong, and it is also a route for travel between Europe and Asia. Its position is very important and can be used as a base for our country's deep-sea fishing industry. Because the island has no residents and is full of reefs, there are no harbors to dock ships, and no high mountains to shield against wind and waves. There are hidden reefs around the coast, which are too shallow close to the shore and too deep far away. It is impossible to find a suitable anchoring position. The island surface is very low and difficult to see from a distance. The wind direction is uncertain, and the water flow is changeable. Sometimes there are hurricanes. Without buoys, lighthouses, meteorological stations, and radio stations, it is extremely dangerous to navigate near the island during the spring mist or bad weather. Looking around, the sea and sky are boundless, but only a few fishing boats from Sanya and Yulin are lonely wandering among the islands. It is about 240 miles from Shuwu Island to Haikou, about 9 miles from Shuwu Island to Lin Island, about 24 miles from Lin Island to Linkang Island, about 40 miles from Lin Island to Dengjinyu Island, about 13 miles from Dengjinyu Island to Jinyin Island, and 145 miles from Jinyin Island to Yulin Island. The islands have many products. They are classified and described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Animals: The Xisha Islands are famous for producing guano. These guanos are excreted by white-bellied boobies, a species of booby family. White-bellied boobies mostly grow on tropical bird islands and live in flocks. Their eggs are slightly smaller than chicken eggs, with mottled brown color. The chicks have pure white feathers, and the adult birds have gray-black feathers with white bellies, green beaks and red feet. Their meat tastes inferior and is not for consumption. Lin Island and Xiao Lin Island are the most inhabited, and they are also often seen in Jinyin Island. In addition, there is a kind of petrel, which is very small in number. Among the mammals, only Lin Island has many rats. There is a kind of lizard among the reptiles, which can be found on Lin Island and all the islands. There are also many insects such as butterflies and moths, but there are no poisonous snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, ants, flies, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Plants: There are not many kinds of plants on Gu Island. Generally, they are common in Sanya and Yulin on Hainan Island. There is a kind of Sanya tree among the trees, which is three or four feet high. They are very lush on Lin Island and Yu Island. Shrubs belonging to the Euphorbiaceae and Moraceae families are all available, as well as Abrus precatorius. Among the weeds, there is a kind of Dentate class and a kind of Gramineae class, and two kinds of Portulacaceae class. There are several coconut trees on Lin Island and Zhang Island, and three palm trees on Coral Island, all about ten feet high, which are enough to be the symbols of the island. The growth of plants on the other islands is roughly the same, but Nanji Sand Island is still mining.</p>
<p>(3) Minerals: Since the Xisha Islands are composed of coral, there are no other minerals except sand and gravel and sea island guano. The phosphate ore formed by guano and guano fossils has two colors and shapes. The powdered ones are millet-colored, and the ones that are solidified into blocks are millet-colored inside and gray outside. The distribution status is that on Lin Island, it forms a layer covering the surface, with an average thickness of 25 centimeters. Each block weighs about several catties to dozens of catties, and there are rarely very large blocks. Underneath is white sand. This kind of bird droppings layer is the most abundant in Yaolin Island, followed by Shidao Island. The rest of Dengjin Island, Zhang Island, Jinyin Island, Coral Island, Linmen Island, Shuwu Island, etc., also have a small amount, but there is no mining value. According to the measurement results, the storage amount on Lin Island is that the area occupied by island guano and fossils is 1,291,600 square meters. Since the average thickness of the ore is 25 centimeters, its volume is 322,900 cubic meters. Among this volume, the volume occupied by plant roots is about one-tenth, so the volume of phosphorus ore is actually 290,610 cubic meters. According to the capacity of the ore-loading handcart on the island, the volume of each cart is 0.065 cubic meters, and the ore-loading weight is half a ton. In this way, the total amount of ore on the island is 223,550 tons. The area that has been mined by the Japanese accounts for about 280,000 square meters. Calculated by the same method, the amount of ore mined is 48,500 tons. Then the amount of ore on the island, excluding the mined ones, is still 175,050 tons. This is the current storage amount of Lin Island alone. The use of phosphate ore is mainly as a soil cultivation material, because the phosphorus, potassium, etc. contained in it are all needed by farmland. If new chemical methods are used to separate and package the phosphorus content, the benefits will be even greater. When the Japanese recruited workers to mine, each person mined one ton of island guano per day and was given two yuan, and transported it to Osaka. After dissolving and mixing, each dan was worth more than 20 yuan, so you can know its benefits. The following is a copy of the composition of the two types of fertilizers A and B published by the Osaka Fertilizer Manufacturing Plant in Japan for reference: (1) Main components in the percentage of type A dissolved and mixed method: total nitrogen content, 6.00, ammonia, 4.00, total phosphoric acid content, 8.30, water-soluble phosphoric acid, 5.50. (2) Main components in the percentage of type B dissolved and mixed method: total nitrogen content, 3.00, ammonia, 2.60, total phosphoric acid content, 15.00, water-soluble phosphoric acid, 11.00, total potash content, 1.00.</p>
<p>(4) Aquatic Products: In the shallow sea around each island, there are seaweed, kelp, seagrass, sea sponges, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, corals, butterfly snails, clams, cuttlefish, coconut crabs, sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, fish, shrimp, grouper shellfish, etc. Fishermen from Hainan mostly catch and pick up shellfish, and they get a lot. The large ones are three or four feet in diameter and weigh more than 100 catties. Shellfish are extremely beautiful, and their shells are about two or three inches long. Fishermen dry them and regard them as scallops. There are also many fish and cuttlefish produced. Fishermen cannot dry them on the spot and it is inconvenient to transport them, so they only take a small amount for daily consumption. Each Hainan fishing boat can hold more than 20 fishermen, and they come and go twice a year. Those who come in early spring return in early summer, and those who come in late autumn return in late winter. Those who come in spring mostly catch turtles, and those who come in autumn mostly pick up shellfish. Sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and shellfish are all available on each island, and sea cucumbers are particularly abundant on Dengjin Island.</p>
<p>The abundance of fisheries and phosphate ore in the Xisha Islands and their importance in national defense have been described above. It is hoped that our country's government and people will urgently seek development and defense, otherwise, it is a shame for the residents to have such a huge abandoned object beside their door.</p>

<h3>INSPECTION OF FINISHED PRODUCTS</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>In the column on November 16, I have already talked about industrial standardization. I think you readers must have realized it. But what is the maintenance of the standard? That is inspection. Now I will briefly explain it below:</p>
<p>Establishing various standards does not seem very difficult, but it is very difficult to fully realize these standards, because in fact absolute precision is almost impossible. Furthermore, even if the tools are extremely sophisticated, the workers are extremely careful, and extremely skilled, it is difficult to produce a replica whose size and form are absolutely consistent with the standard. Therefore, in practical terms, the theoretical standard must be replaced by the practical standard. The so-called practical standard means indicating to what extent the product can differ from the theoretical standard and still be perfect. The allowable difference of the theoretical standard varies with the nature of the work. Generally, for rough work, the range of difference in terms of the nature of work, craftsmanship, and sophisticated workmanship can be slightly larger. For fine work, if the degree of perfection required in terms of partial interchangeability, such as with carbine rifles, is very important, then the range of difference in the size of its parts must be extremely small, and it is not easy to obtain perfect results unless the work is very careful. The experience recently gained by factories in the United States that manufacture carbine rifles and other military supplies can illustrate this principle.</p>
<p>The so-called inspection is a technique of comparing various materials, products, and actions with the established standards. Therefore, without precise standards, there is absolutely no perfect inspection. When carrying out inspections, some of the things to be inspected are beyond the already generous difference limit, some are within the difference limit, and some are very close to the set standard. Inspection is a technique to find the one that is most suitable for the work at hand from these three types of products. Therefore, if the difference limit of the standard is slightly smaller, the inspection work must be very precise. In addition, we should also pay attention to the fact that inspection is not always purely mechanical work, and also requires the inspector's good judgment. Indeed, in general production industries, there is really no work like inspection that requires sharp judgment and deep knowledge of the work. This situation is especially obvious for work with extremely small difference limits, such as mass production of precision products.</p>
<p>Sometimes the standard of the work cannot be accurately written on paper, so we have to resort to samples. Because the color of the product and the finishing touch after completion, which cannot be written down, can be indicated by samples. Also, in chemical factories, we can often get 100% pure products and can pay the standard explanation. Therefore, the problem of similarity between work standards and theoretical standards really varies with the nature of the industry and the work. Personnel engaged in inspection, if they do not have a clear understanding of these limitations, will definitely not have perfect inspection.</p>
<p>The necessary conditions for inspecting materials can be based on any one or several of the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Quantitative; that is, about the quantity or number of pieces of the material. (2) Qualitative; that is, about the material's physical or chemical properties. (3) Dimensional; that is, about the material's form and the condition after completion. (4) Sales-related; that is, about the question of whether the material is suitable for its original purpose. Generally speaking, it is always inconvenient and inappropriate for all inspection work to be handled by one department or a group of people, so most factories always divide them into three separate parts, although the work of each part can sometimes overlap. Raw materials are generally inspected by the inventory department under the jurisdiction of the inventory director; dimensions and other manufacturing methods are inspected by the workshop inspectors under the jurisdiction of the general foreman; and completed products can be inspected by other personnel to assume the final inspection. In engineering factories and other factories that use scientific methods of manufacturing, the final inspection and action test are generally carried out by the engineering department or the design department.</p>
<h3>Everyone Be a Salesperson</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>One of the most important tasks this year can be said to be the issue of sales promotion. This is because it is closely related to the production increase plan. According to theory, a production increase plan must be based on sales as the target. And the pure profit of an industry or business should be obtained from the actual sales of goods.</p>
<p>During the time when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, due to currency devaluation and lack of goods, no one cared about the sales of goods, nor did they need to care about sales. They only needed to hoard raw materials or finished products to make profits. Therefore, the art of sales promotion, which has always been ignored, was even more put aside and not applied.</p>
<p>But the situation is different now. Goods stored will only lose interest and will not help production. Only by expanding sales with high-quality goods can we make ourselves prosperous and lay the foundation for the future.</p>
<p>A person who is good at using sales promotion techniques can sell goods at higher prices, in larger quantities, in wider areas, and gain more and more satisfied customers.</p>
<p>In general, people really have a situation of knowing something about the sales of goods but not understanding why. This situation is partly due to a lack of talent, and at the same time, it is not easy to conduct market research or market analysis in China. But for the current plan, we must use more power, time, and energy to carry out sales promotion work in a scientific way. This is because, on the one hand, producers themselves urgently need to expand sales, and at the same time, when purchasing power is weak, there is an even greater need to use scientific sales promotion techniques to solve difficulties and overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>I believe that starting this year, everyone in every organization should be trained to become an excellent salesperson. The salesperson mentioned here is general rather than narrow.</p>
<p>A salesperson in the narrow sense sells a product and completes the sales work. A salesperson in the broad sense creates a good impression in society and gains social sympathy. The act of purchasing may not happen immediately, but some basic work has already been done in advance, and it will lead to the act of purchasing at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>To put this broad sense of sales promotion more clearly, the spirit of shop and factory employees and pleasant customer reception, and the hard work of supervisors day and night, can generate goodwill internally and externally, and the emotional result of mutual sincerity between capital and labor can achieve labor-capital coordination. All of these can be said to be the effects of sales promotion in a broad sense.</p>
<p>Originally, Salesmanship is the most practical academic discipline, and individuals, factories, and countries can all apply it and achieve success. According to the current situation, everyone becoming a salesperson may be a very appropriate proposal.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Agricultural Improvement</h3>
<p>— Fan Xi</p>
<p>(1) Seed Improvement: To increase agricultural production, it is necessary to improve seeds. Imagine, without good seeds, how can you breed excellent offspring? Regarding seed improvement, it is best to set up breeding farms to cultivate excellent purebred varieties, and then distribute them to farmers. After the victory, the establishment of breeding farms is still pitifully small!</p>
<p>(2) Disease and Insect Control: Agricultural crop diseases and insect pests are common in our country. For example, locusts, rice stem borers, and rust diseases always occur on rice and wheat every year. Because of years of war, the prevention and control of agricultural crop diseases and insect pests has almost been neglected. How worrying is the future of agricultural production!</p>
<p>(3) Agricultural Product Processing: To preserve agricultural products for a long time, they must be processed. Rice, cotton, vegetables, and fruits all need processing. The technology of processing is also in urgent need of research and improvement!</p>
<p>(4) Improve Transportation</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Implementation of Personnel Management (5) How to Make Employees Work</p>
<p>Because enabling employees to serve an enterprise organization or factory for a long time can be said to be an important principle of personnel management. Therefore, when recruiting and selecting employees, we must be strict. After they are employed, we must find ways to make them serve for a long time. Because repeated transfers of employees are detrimental to the enterprise organization or factory. In this place, especially specialized technical talents, cannot be allowed to transfer freely. There are usually several ways to make employees serve the enterprise organization or factory for a long time:</p>
<p>1. Trade Association Agreement</p>
<p>No matter what kind of goods are manufactured, or what kind of business is operated, there are always fellow businesses on the market. For example, if we open a pharmaceutical factory, there are many other pharmaceutical factories on the market. If our factory staff resign and go to another manufacturing factory, they will inevitably reveal our factory's secrets or manufacturing methods. This is unfavorable to us. Conversely, if employees from other factories come to our factory, then that manufacturing factory will have an unfavorable situation. Indeed, sometimes for business reasons, we inevitably try to outwit each other, using all means to recruit employees from other factories. However, if we can compete for employees from other factories, other manufacturers can also compete for our employees in the same way. For the sake of mutual interests, there is a method of trade association agreement, that is, several relatively close fellow businesses make an agreement, stating that they will never hire each other's employees, that is, Factory A will never hire Factory B's employees, nor will they use any other means to recruit factory employees. This method can provide protection for both Factory A and Factory B at the same time. However, this method still belongs to the negative aspect. In addition to negative prevention, we also need to do positive work, that is, consider the issue of employee treatment. We must make them feel at ease to work. If they can feel at ease to work, then they will definitely not want to seek development outside.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Output Declines Daily A Crisis Urgently Needs to Be Saved</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture. In the midst of the production increase movement, how to increase agricultural production is of course a very important issue. However, to our disappointment, the rural economy has been deteriorating recently. Since the victory, not only has agricultural production not increased, but on the contrary, it has been decreasing. I have observed and investigated this issue, and based on my research, I will briefly express my humble opinion as follows.</p>
<p>My hometown, Songjiang, is a rice-producing area. Among the residents of the whole county, more than a certain percentage are engaged in agriculture. According to the survey results, in normal years, if the weather is good and there are no sudden changes, one mu of rice paddy can produce three dan of white rice. Even if the year is slightly worse, it can still produce more than two dan. But in recent years, it has been decreasing. Especially this year, the weather is quite good, and insect pests are not found. However, the average farmland only produces two dan of rice at best, and the worse ones produce less than two dan. Otherwise, in such a year, there is always hope for three dan.</p>
<p>Why is this? The main point is of course that the rural economy has felt exhausted. Many farmers live on loans, borrowing rice and money, and are oppressed by high interest rates. The monthly interest rate for borrowing money is more than two cents, and the monthly interest rate for borrowing rice is one dou per dan. To increase field production, sufficient fertilization is an important matter. However, under the circumstances of excessively low rice prices and expensive fertilizers, most farmers cannot apply sufficient fertilizer. With less fertilizer, it will naturally affect the production effect. Year after year, after two or three years of oppression and poor harvests, some farmers are already struggling to farm and are forced to leave Chen Village to find work in the city. However, the city is in a recession, making it impossible to advance or retreat, and they are trapped in a desperate situation. The number of abandoned fields that have not been cultivated for two or three years is gradually increasing. If this continues, rice production will inevitably decrease rather than increase, and the harm will become increasingly serious!</p>
<p>In response to the above points, it is necessary to first relieve farmers from the oppression of high interest rates. Therefore, rural loans from banks cannot be delayed any longer, and must be widespread, so that poor farmers in each village can obtain low-interest loans from banks, so that they can have the strength to purchase more fertilizer when fertilizing. It is also important to reduce the selling price of various fertilizers. Moreover, as mentioned above, the yield of three dan of rice per mu has not yet reached the highest yield in most fields. In other words, if more fertilizer is applied, the rice yield can reach more than three dan. Therefore, the authorities must encourage farmers to apply more fertilizer than before the war. Finally, the ratio of rice prices to various other prices should also be averaged. Otherwise, if all goods are expensive and only rice is cheap, it will also force farmers to reduce fertilization and leave the fields, affecting agricultural production. The so-called low prices harm farmers. On a small scale, it affects the lives of farmers and the rural economy. On a large scale, it is related to the country's production effect. The harm to the future is greater than this, and it must be prevented!</p>

<h3>Literature and Progress</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Literature is crucial for promoting society. Although writers in the Victorian era temporarily favored departures from reality, leaning towards embellishment, they fostered sound political customs. Since symbolism and neo-idealism replaced realism, and psychology and natural sciences entered the ivory tower, it has also supported science. Philology has also become globalized in the past ten years. People like Schatterwell have simply regarded literary research as science, inheriting the pace of Taine, and have another non-purely literary pace.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when making literature effective or giving it the function of promoting society, what elements should it carry in terms of expression? There are different opinions and positions on this point. And what can make it have existential value in the future must be inseparable from novelty. No matter how the past styles, content, and ideas are evaluated, they cannot be considered to have timeliness. With the new conditions, and then seek other suitable conditions that can be called promoting society.</p>
<p>We need some writers like Defoe but more skillful than him; we need Rabelais and France to make us laugh easily; we need Sherwood Anderson to write ordinary stories from the countryside; we need Alexei Tolstoy to write about the historical national heroes; we need Wells to write scientific fantasies, enough to indicate future prophetic reports; we need Hankin's hazy dreamlike legends; we need Maeterlinck's symbolic techniques to inspire bright ideals.</p>
<p>There is no need to say more about the cultivation and supplementary revision outside of literature, and the life observation and adventure outside of life. These methods contribute to new content, which is something that even a student knows. Reality is scientific, but everyone easily feels troubled by it. Idealism is philosophically unified, but it easily escapes and stumbles. It seems that without it at all, one cannot help but feel the emptiness of art itself.</p>
<p>Forgetting reality has been almost the same trend in the past ten years and at present. From 1943 to 1944, the literary world in the Southwest almost took removing the reality of that time as a means of seeking comfort. Isn't it the same today? Seeking non-realistic comfort and enjoyment, forgetting the light and wounds of last night, this has become a general psychological trend, and it cannot be said that it is not excessive. But we hope to require artisticization in this trend, and to require adapting to a path of promoting society. There are nine Muses in ancient Greece, each in charge of a part. Can it be said that lyric poetry is poetry, and expression plays are drama? 27, 12, Republic 36,</p>
<h3>Scraps of Paper</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Counting on my fingers, it's exactly a year.</p>
<p>A year! If a wisp of unextinguished memory remains in your soul in heaven, perhaps you will think the same as me. Of course, I absolutely don't want you to think like this, nor do I want myself to think like this. Under the separation of life and death, we must never allow ourselves to think like this. But on the edge of this snowy and windy first month, in this desolate and lonely cold winter night, under this dim and silent lamplight, I finally remembered you again. Remembered you, although I no longer sob and weep like before, I still can't hold back a painful heart, knowing that you can't hear, but I still want to tell you foolishly.</p>
<p>Tell you that I left that small town five months ago. That small town, didn't I tell you long ago that I was going to leave? I said I was a fledgling bird, waiting for the opportunity to mature, rushing to the sky, never to return. I also said that I was a fallen flower under the fence, expecting the heroic storm to take me to the free ocean and blue sky. I also said that at the latest when the apricot blossoms bloom in April, I will definitely be on the journey. But who would have thought that the day I left the small town with a small package, the apricot blossoms in April had already bloomed, the roses in May had also withered, the withered petals of wild attacks in June had fallen all over the fields of the small town, and the scorching sun in July had already lazily slanted to the west.</p>
<p>Of course, I dare not deceive you and say that everything is for you. I also dare not deceive you and say that I have always been thinking of you in those days. But I will never deceive you: on that stormy night, when my toes stepped on that prosperous city, there was only one thing in my heart, and that was you!</p>
<p>Don't think this is a child's play, thinking that the most burning emotions of young people are nothing more than a strange firework. Even if it has released amazing and gorgeous brilliance in the dark night, it will eventually be extinguished in the silent torrent of time. What's more, we have gone through the struggle of life, the tempering of death, countless stormy waves and countless hardships, and finally like two tattered leaves in the storm, accidentally falling together and occasionally separating, what is so strange about this? What is worth recalling and sighing about?</p>
<p>Our life is the dewdrop on the tip of the grass, rolling in and rolling out, destroying ourselves! Just let the withered grass be resurrected! I remember a poet once said this, and I also admit it. Therefore, when you first raised that cup to me with pleading eyes, I knew that what was in that cup was not fragrant nectar, but a difficult bitter liquid, but I finally took it resolutely and swallowed it with tears. You heard my happy voice: "I am willing." But you didn't hear a sentence in my heart: "For you!"</p>
<p>I have regretted it thousands of times, and complained ten thousand times: why couldn't I have known you before that misty day; in the spring when our young lives were as bright as flowers; when the heads of life, the chains of death, thousands of hardships and ten thousand threats had not weighed on our shoulders? Couldn't we have put on hard armor together to resist the oncoming wind and waves and thunderbolts?</p>
<p>When I met you, it was not only misty, but also in a storm, in a chaotic world, almost at the time of destruction!</p>
<p>How could I not know my own weakness, how could I not know that you live on the bright horizon, and I live in the dark corner of the sea. Unless the mountains and seas are turned upside down, unless living things are destroyed, unless one day the flame of truth burns down this evil era, even if we struggle to break our bones and tear our flesh, we will never be able to eliminate the distance that separates us.</p>
<p>However, even across immeasurable distances, we finally disregarded everything and resolutely offered our lives and souls to the altar of truth at the same time!</p>
<p>You sacrificed yourself on that altar of truth; you left me forever; you said goodbye forever to the bright sky and the beautiful world!</p>
<p>A year! I left that small town alone and walked into the prosperous city alone. I searched for your footprints on the streets of the city, searched for your voice, appearance, and smile, searched for your bright red blood and dry white bones. I was almost like a crazy madman, running around in the crowds of cars and horses and the dazzling lights. Four months of work is better than a long four years. My black and bright hair withered and turned yellow, my round face became pointed and thin, and those big, round, bright eyes, which you used to be proud of, were about to lose the brilliance of living people. I even shouted your name at the head of the Huangpu River in the deep night, bitterly shouting your name...</p>
<p>But I can't shout to you. Your worms, your bones, your voice, appearance, and your footprints have long been stepped on and ruthlessly trampled by many huge feet, hard feet, feet nailed with iron hammers...</p>
<p>I left the prosperous city in disappointment, on a drizzly day a month ago. I boarded a crowded train, took out a blue handkerchief and wiped the tears from the corners of my eyes. On the corner of that handkerchief, there was still your handwritten name.</p>
<p>A year! In this desolate and lonely strange little place, I can't even find a small flower. Only two lines of bitter tears and an unchanging heart are respectfully offered to you on the anniversary of your death today. (Reviewed in Yunjian in February of the 36th year).</p>
<h3>Gao Zhi's Character</h3>
<p>— Mingchun</p>
<p>In the Chinese literary world, there is someone who has devoted himself to translation for ten years, enduring the blows of life, but always sticking to his post, silently content; when his translation is published, others are surprised by its voluminousness and secretly sigh "Good guy, it is not easy to read it once, thanks to his patience in translating it." Gao Zhi is this kind of person.</p>
<p>If someone has paid attention to publications such as Crescent Moon, Big Dipper, Eastern Miscellany, Shen Bao Monthly, New China, Guowen Weekly, and Ta Kung Pao before the war, the name Gao Zhi is not unfamiliar, is it?</p>
<p>When he was in college, he was still the most interesting big child in the class. When listening to lectures, he often drew some funny pictures of little people and dogs on the request for meaning, or distributed a few peanuts to the students sitting next to him. His coat pocket was often filled with snacks.</p>
<p>He is very smart, his English is very good, and his novels and essays are also pretty good. Mr. Lin Yutang has extremely praised his proposition to transform Chinese characters.</p>
<p>After ten years of separation, he not only became a professor, but also became an expert in the study of Tolstoy, almost the only expert in China. If you have read his article "The Accompaniment Method of Tolstoy's Description of Psychological Transformation" published in Ta Kung Pao's Sunday Literary Cocoon (35, 12, 15), you will not doubt my conclusion. People who do not have a full understanding of Tolstoy's works cannot write a single word in that kind of article.</p>
<p>He has translated all of Tolstoy's important works, such as "War and Peace", "Anna Karenina", "Resurrection", "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth".</p>
<p>It is said that there is a famous scholar in Shanghai who is famous for translating Russian social science books. When translating, he deliberately placed the Russian original on his desk, but put the Japanese translation in the drawer. When someone visited him, they only saw the Russian original placed on the desk, which shocked people with his linguistic talent.</p>
<p>Gao Zhi does not seek to shock people. He believes that translating Russian directly is not a big deal.</p>
<p>Because his English is good and his Russian is also good, many people ask him which country he studied in or whether he has returned from Moscow. But he is a genuine student of the Republic of China who has been from Nanjing to Chongqing and is now back from Chongqing to Nanjing.</p>
<p>He loves translation work as much as he loves his life. He also yearns for the prospects of life and the world. He wants to ferry himself and others to the other side full of sunshine and flowers.</p>
<p>He has a purpose, confidence, no worries, less loneliness in life, adheres to the cultural post, and stubbornly strives for progress. He does not know what failure is, and failure will never come to a person full of vitality.</p>
<p>I believe that in today's world where human desires are rampant and people are eager for quick success and instant benefits, and the literary world can still reveal some brilliance, people like Gao Zhi are worthy of respect.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Ancient Monk—One of the Xin'an School Painters</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>The Buddhist monk Hongren, whose style name was Jianjiang, was from Shexian. He loved plum blossoms and was known as the Plum Blossom Ancient Monk; his secular surname was Jiang, his given name was Tao, his style name was Liuqi, and his pseudonym was Oumeng. He was orphaned at a young age and was extremely filial to his mother; he was a Ming Dynasty student. After his mother passed away, he did not marry or take office. He entered Fujian and traveled to Wuyi, relying on the Buddhist monk Guhang as a teacher. He once lived in Huangshan Qiyun. His landscape paintings learned from Song people in his early years, and later learned from Yunlin, obtaining the interest of Xiao Shu Dan Yi, and was as famous as Hongcan Daoji, but he was able to create his own style.</p>
<p>The Buddhist monk Jianjiang's brushwork is exquisite and wonderful. Together with Xiu Ning Wang Zhirui, Haiyang Cha Shibiao, and Huizhou Sun Wuyi, they are collectively known as the Four Masters of the Xin'an School. Wang, Cha, and Sun have lofty sentiments and extraordinary character.</p>
<p>Outside the West Gate of Shexian County, cross the Taiping Bridge and pass through the Taibai Tower to enter the Xigan Scenic Area. The flowing water is gurgling and the tall trees shade the sky. Ascend the steps to build the Plum Blossom Ancient Monk's Abode. Plum blossoms are planted everywhere along the road, with transverse and sparse shadows, and the environment is extremely secluded. Above is the Former Residence of the Buddhist monk Jianjiang. Before the Anti-Japanese War, County Speaker Jiang Tonghou discussed rebuilding it with great care. The Changqing Pagoda and Piyun Peak are arranged in front and back. The tomb of Mr. Wang Caibai, the recluse of Xitong, was newly built across the hill. The county people publicly buried him here. Two generations of artists stand in the east and west, and will be immortal with the rivers, mountains, sun, and stars!</p>
<h3>Inscription on the Painting of Pine Trees on Cliffs by Duo Ci</h3>
<p>— Xu Shaodi</p>
<p>The cliffs are jagged with thousands upon thousands of thorns,</p>
<p>The twisting branches soar like celestial gates;</p>
<p>The pines whisper, generating sorrowful winds,</p>
<p>The mists and clouds conjure fantastical tales before my eyes;</p>
<p>The peach and willow trees of the human world are all delicate and exquisite,</p>
<p>But they mock the bearded elder for his noble purity;</p>
<p>Do you not see the mountains cracking in the freezing cold,</p>
<p>Ten thousand trees withered and broken together;</p>
<p>Only the pines of the Qiongtai,</p>
<p>Defy frost and snow, their scales like iron.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Spring Grass</h3>
<p>— Hu Ne</p>
<p>In the severe winter, the earth seems to be covered with a layer of gray gauze, and the sky is always floating with gray clouds, either raining or snowing, making people almost unable to breathe, and it feels like a heavy lead block is pressing down in the pottery.</p>
<p>Fortunately, spring may follow closely behind winter, and the gloom of the earth will be swept away, bringing vigor, freshness, beauty, and lively days.</p>
<p>As the English poet Shelley said well: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?"</p>
<p>Isn't it? At that time, the earth is full of vitality, the farmers in the fields sing simple and lovely harvest songs, the grass and trees grow a new green, welcoming the sunshine of the new spring, and a vibrant vigor is scattered throughout the natural world.</p>
<p>Latent and dead things are all reborn in spring.</p>
<p>Spring symbolizes promising young people, aspiring ambitions, and a bright future. How many promising philosophers and scholars have not laid their immortal foundation in their youth, letting the glorious and bright light forever shine on the world!</p>
<p>Spring! We sing your praises, you bring so much new hope to the world!</p>
<h3>Two Essays</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ran</p>
<p>Lamp</p>
<p>After the electric light went out, I lit a candle.</p>
<p>Struggling out of the reign of darkness, I cast a kind and passionate gaze upon everything familiar around me.</p>
<p>From now on, ignoring those gloomy, hideous faces in the darkness, all chaos and emptiness. A little light brings us warmth and confidence.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the cold stars in the sky outside the window, sparkling and emitting their beautiful light, bringing noble comfort to so many sleepless people in the chilling night! And facing the dome of the sky, thinking of the magnificent universe, the light of each star will weave into thousands of cosmic meridians and parallels.</p>
<p>And mankind, after all, has lamps, with lamps there is light, and in the darkness, a magnificent universe of mankind is woven.</p>
<p>"Well, you old fool, don't let the lamp be blown out by the cold wind outside the window!" We have to finish a piece of work under the lamp, the night outside the window is darker, raindrops beat on the window panes, and the lamplight flickers precariously.</p>
<p>"Hey! Look, there's a light approaching in the distance." And then the gong sounded.</p>
<p>We are heading towards dawn.</p>
<p>Rain</p>
<p>It's raining, do you feel annoyed?</p>
<p>The muddy road, coupled with the cold wind, the umbrella can hardly hold. If you are not careful, you will slip and fall into the mud, or perhaps fall into the ditch beside the road full of dirty water - and there is still a long way to go ahead.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Thinking that the raindrops of spring will make the green grass grow luxuriantly, thinking that the raindrops of summer will wash away the dust in the sky and bring endless freshness:</p>
<p>Thinking that the raindrops will wash away the dirt on the ground; thinking that the raindrops will converge into the torrent of the Yangtze River, rushing and flowing towards the sea...</p>
<p>Thinking of the people struggling in the bleak wind and bitter rain, a group of suffering people, for their ideals; also thinking of the lighthouse keepers lighting that star of light in the night of storms, pointing the way for so many lost souls...</p>
<p>Thinking of the tranquility after the storm; thinking of a beautiful sunny day after the rain. Then, let the rain continue to fall</p>
<p>And I should get up from where I fell and continue on the road.</p>
<p>Tomorrow should be a clear day.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 157</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: The Secret of "Eight"</p>
<p>"So, Pingzi has also come here (Beiping)?"</p>
<p>After Hejian and I met, he vividly recounted all the details from joining the Black Dragon Society in Japan to failing to search for the "Seven Sealed Secrets" and being ordered to fly back to the mainland. He spoke in both Beijing dialect and Japanese, emptying his heart, and told me everything. I recorded the outline, program, and key points of the story he told me. Although there were a few unclear points, I didn't have time to ask about them now. I was anxious to know the whereabouts of this mysterious Miss Pingzi. I couldn't calm down until I finished listening to his story, and then I asked this question.</p>
<p>"I came by plane," Hejian told me, "Pingzi, and the 'Manchurian Bitch' in Pingzi's mouth, are all settled in the Shenyang headquarters. The big one still has some tricks...but!" Hejian stopped here, as if thinking of a very difficult problem that needed careful consideration, and then relit a cigarette and paced back and forth in the room. This was his old habit, so I had to not disturb him, just sat aside and organized my diary, filling in the missing days, times, locations, etc.</p>
<p>The place where we are meeting now is the only safe and secret place in Beiping - "Beiping ×× Hotel" (Readers, please forgive me, until today, this place has the need for external secrecy, and it is still difficult to announce without the consent of a certain confidential agency). After I returned from Tongzhou with Miss Yaoqun and Little Tiger, thanks to Mr. W's kindness, he kept a few of us together and entertained us as much as possible. Except for important matters that required going out, we all stayed on this fifth floor. "No. 〇 Haosi" and a few elite subordinates are also here, and secret telegrams are also received and sent here. There are also Mr. W's communication equipment upstairs, which is very convenient. So as soon as Hejian arrived in Beiping, we picked him up so that he could rest quietly.</p>
<p>Hejian walked back and forth in the room a few times, then suddenly stopped and looked at me, "Old brother, what do you think this 'eight' character means?"</p>
<p>"August 1st? I was confused for a moment and asked him back.</p>
<p>Hejian laughed when he heard my question, as if he found my dazed look a bit funny.</p>
<p>"Old brother, you're not necessarily very smart, maybe your brain is overworked and a little unresponsive? Hurry up... have a cigarette, no matter how sophisticated the machine is, it always needs oil." As he spoke and laughed, he threw me a military-grade cigarette.</p>
<p>"You're wrong," I said, smoking the cigarette, "I'm asking about Pingzi's affairs. You didn't answer the question completely, and suddenly you brought up the question of 'eight'; but my mind is still thinking about Pingzi."</p>
<p>"This 'eight' is exactly Pingzi's business," Hejian suddenly stopped smiling, his face full of worries, "I predict that she is undertaking a very important mission for Tokyo. She always seemed a little distracted when using her fingers to tap out telegrams. This is a sign that she has something on her mind. Ordinary small problems would never bother her like that; what makes her distracted must be a very big problem. I also asked her a few times, but she always hid it and changed the subject with small talk. It wasn't until she saw me off at the airport in Shenyang that she blurted out a sentence - telling me to pay attention to the secret of 'eight'. I think the secret of 'eight' is not difficult to explain, but I can't predict which aspect it is."</p>

<h3>Athletes Never Return! Xu Chengji Dies in London A Great Loss to Chinese Sports</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>This is an immeasurable and significant loss to the Chinese sports world! Tennis player Xu Chengji died in London on the 31st of last month, acute pneumonia destroyed this superstar who once shone on the world sports stage. From now on, I don't know how many years we will have to wait to realize the dream of an initial Davis Cup victory!</p>
<p>Chengji was a tennis genius. China's sports achievements are inferior to those of Western countries in everything, and the only glory is Xu's various championships won in tennis tournaments in various European countries. He has won the All England Hard Court Tennis Championship and championships in Berlin, Germany, Birmingham, England, and was a player in the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships and a Chinese representative in the Davis Cup for many years. For ten years, he has shown his power overseas, and has really earned a lot of face for Chinese sports.</p>
<p>When the Second National Games were held in the capital in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, remote provinces and overseas Chinese compatriots traveled long distances to participate. Xu Chengji, as a tennis player from Batavia, participated in a formal competition in China for the first time and defeated a Shanghai player. The report of the National Games has a paragraph describing Xu's skills:</p>
<p>"Xu uses special and superb techniques, left and right, omnipotent, serving like artillery shells. Rapid draws like arrows, shooting straight to the baseline, or gently picking the edge of the net, or blocking the net and intercepting, sometimes using high balls to press and strike, slamming over the net, with wonderful performances, applause and thunder, Xu's technique is a magical performance, and is indeed the only one in China."</p>
<p>He stunned the country at the age of twenty</p>
<p>At that time, Xu was only a twenty-year-old youth, and he had already caused a sensation across the country. In the twenty-fourth year, he was assigned by the government to go to the United States with Zheng Zhaojia to participate in the Davis Cup. Xu and Zheng each won a match, which was the first harvest for our country in the three years of participating in the Davis Cup. In the twenty-fifth year, our country changed to participate in the European League, and Xu still participated. After the competition, he stayed in Europe and concentrated on practicing. In half a year, he participated in twelve competitions and won a total of nine championships, six in Southern Europe, two in Greece, and one in Birmingham, England. In the twenty-sixth year, Xu's tennis skills were even more superb in the Davis Cup. The British Daily Herald praised him as "the masterpiece of China's first master", but unfortunately, his partner was not good and suffered an unjust defeat.</p>
<p>He reached the last eight of Wimbledon and defeated two Austin, almost entering the ranks of the world's first-class tennis players. In the French International Tennis Championships, he defeated Lesueur, the third-ranked French player, causing a sensation throughout Paris and being hailed as the reincarnation of Lacoste.</p>
<p>He grew up in the South and looked like a scholar</p>
<p>Looking at the tennis court, Chengji is not a burly person, he is a typical southerner. The posture of hitting the ball still carries some "scholar" air, without overly violent movements, but when the ball he hits falls on the opponent's side, everyone will feel its weight. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he gave speeches in various parts of Southeast Asia and donated money to the government. Later, the flames of the enemy became more intense. After the Pacific War, he lived in seclusion in his hometown of Batavia (his health may have been damaged at that time). Last year, he reappeared to participate in the Davis Cup, and his power was even greater than in those days. Although the result was a failure, Chengji's singles were always a must-win.</p>
<p>He does not smoke or drink. Since he started learning tennis at the age of thirteen, he has always worked hard and practiced without the slightest slack. Apart from tennis, he has no other hobbies. On the outside, he is a frail scholar, but on the tennis court, he is a brave general who can fight hard for five sets. He also has good sportsmanship. Although he does not hide his joy of winning, he does not bury other people's strengths, and does not have the arrogance of bad athletes. He is a Minnan overseas Chinese. In addition to his native dialect, he can speak some Mandarin. During his stay in Europe, he can also speak English and Dutch, and can also cope with German and French. In January of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, he married Miss Bowulf, a British tennis player, in London, but divorced in March of last year. His brother's tennis skills are also excellent, and they can be called unparalleled.</p>
<p>Such a serious and hardworking Chinese youth died of illness at the age of only thirty-four. In the international sports world, who else will be the second Xu Chengji?</p>

<p>Old News on the Inside Story of World War II</p>
<h3>A Small Village in Czechoslovakia Receives a Windfall (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Six Million U.S. Dollars Distributed Universally</p>
<p>Suppose a group of new people suddenly came to the small village where you live and distributed six million U.S. dollars to the residents of the city, and everyone could get an unimaginable sum of money. Do you think this is possible? You would definitely say that this is a daydream, right?</p>
<p>However, things are unpredictable. About a year and a half ago, the village of Sastin in the northeast corner of Czechoslovakia did receive a windfall.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at the end of April 1945. At that time, the German army was still occupying the small village of Sastin, which was located on the Czech-Austrian border. There were only a few thousand farmers in the area, and it was a deserted village. After the news that the Soviet army was approaching the village spread, the local German garrison was in a state of panic. They were preparing to retreat north into Austria.</p>
<p>In the Sastin Town Hall, which was then used as a command post, the Nazi commander's eyes were fixed on several boxes lying in disarray, which were filled with Czech banknotes. The money was originally looted by the Nazis from the vaults of the Czech National Bank in Bratislava.</p>
<p>Now that the Red Army was in pursuit, the distraught Nazi commander decided to abandon the staggering sum of money. Outside the command post, a car was waiting to take him to safety. Of course, the car could not fit such large objects as banknote boxes, so he locked the boxes, put the key in his pocket, and then called in two young Slovak farmers who had been conscripted by the German war machine.</p>
<p>German troops fled in embarrassment, leaving behind a large amount of banknotes "I will leave these boxes to you for safekeeping, hide them well. You two are fully responsible. If I come back in the future - our army will definitely come back - you can get a reward, understand?"</p>
<p>The soldiers nodded dumbly. After a while, the Nazi officer left. The two frightened Slovaks quickly took off their German uniforms, put on civilian clothes, jumped on their bicycles, and fled to the countryside. As for the boxes, they remained in the old place.</p>
<p>The next morning, a battalion of Soviet troops occupied Sastin. Of course, the first target of the Soviet troops' search was undoubtedly the former Nazi command post, and the most eye-catching thing was these boxes. The battalion commander opened one of them and picked up a few bundles of banknotes. What to do with them? That was a difficult question.</p>
<p>In order to understand the Soviet officer's actions, we must remember that these Soviet troops belonged to General Konev's command, and they had advanced from Stalingrad. They fought continuously, week after week, month after month, with only one thought in their minds: "Invade Berlin or die."</p>

<h3>Welcoming Spring (To the tune of "West River Moon")</h3>

<p>Tomorrow is the Beginning of Spring again. Gold is not worth a penny.</p>
<p>Spring comes and winter goes, most heart-wrenching, all old habits are changed in one morning,</p>
<p>How much has white rice risen? Never again will the ground be dark and the sky be dim!</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Xisha Islands!</h3>
<p>— Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>After the victory, China was listed as one of the "Four Powers," and France was not included because it was still waiting for domestic consolidation. Later, the "Four Powers" were changed to the "Five Powers," and one power was added to fill China's position with France, and China was relegated to the bottom. We watched other countries quickly recover their international status, while we had just stepped onto the stage and then retreated, and we really felt endless shame. Recently, French troops once again landed on the Xisha Islands under the pretext of "recovering sovereignty on behalf of Annam," infringing on our country's sovereignty and causing regret in Sino-French relations. When France was occupied, China extended great sympathy and called for assistance. China and France are both countries seeking freedom and peace, but now France is taking advantage of our country's unstable domestic situation to occupy the Xisha Islands by force, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Even if the "sovereignty" of the Xisha Islands belongs to Annam, France should "recover" it on behalf of Annam through diplomatic means, and should not rush to station troops there. Moreover, according to the White Paper's statement: "History proves that the islands have always belonged to China, and France's actions are of course an occupation. What is the basis for claiming sovereignty?" It also suggests submitting this issue to international arbitration. We believe that the Xisha Islands incident is purely a diplomatic issue between China and France and can be resolved by China and France themselves without troubling the international community, if the French side is sincere. "International arbitration" is like two children quarreling and pulling an adult out to "mediate," saying a fair word. The adult listens to both sides, each with its own argument, and does not know which side to help, so it will not have much effect.</p>
<p>The "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident" both called for international arbitration. What was the result? Unexpectedly, today's France is playing the same trick again. Looking back on the past, I feel deeply emotional and cannot help but sigh!</p>
<h3>Chinese People Can Also Lead Americans</h3>
<p>— Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao (transliteration), a famous Chinese doctor born in Honolulu, USA, graduated from the University of Hawaii, and is currently 30 years old. He was originally the director of the Biological Laboratory of the Quartermaster Depot in Philadelphia. He is now leading a group of American scientists in researching methods to eliminate bacteria. This type of bacteria caused great damage to military equipment and clothing during the Pacific War. Although the medical community has invented several bactericides and can eliminate 400,000 types of bacteria, there are still some that cannot be killed. According to the Department of the Army, "The current research is led by Mr. Xiao, and many famous American bacteriologists, mycologists, and biologists are assisting. Significant progress has been made...."</p>
<p>A foreign scholar once said: "Chinese people have clever minds and extraordinary wit, but most people cannot make good use of them, or are limited by economics. No matter what they study, they learn some superficial knowledge and give up halfway, without further study. If they can strive for perfection, carefully ponder, and add economic support, their achievements can surpass others."</p>
<p>The fact that Mr. Xiao is leading American scientists in researching methods to kill bacteria proves that this statement is not wrong. I hope that everyone will take this news as a warning and do their best, so as not to betray the talent and hands that nature has given us!</p>
<h3>If Roosevelt Had Not Died</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>January 30th was the birthday of the late President Roosevelt of the United States. Bells were rung across the United States to commemorate and remember one of the greatest presidents in American history. During his lifetime, Roosevelt had many political enemies, but few people spoke ill of him after his death. Roosevelt's great personality can be seen from this. After Roosevelt's death, the world situation has been contradictory and complicated, unlike the unity during the war. On President Roosevelt's birthday, I think every American, and even people in any country in the world, have a question in their hearts: If Roosevelt were still alive today, what would the world situation be like?</p>
<h3>Japanese Workers Have "Progressed"!</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>In the past week, Japan has been brewing a major strike, scheduled to launch nationwide on February 1st. It is said that the total number of striking workers across the country, including those participating in sympathy strikes, will reach 8.6 million, which can be said to be the largest labor movement in history. If the Japanese labor community really ignores MacArthur's ban and holds the strike as scheduled, it will be a "spectacle"! What is strange is that these Japanese workers, who have served the Japanese warlords for so long and assisted in the war of aggression, have suddenly become so "progressive" and so "democratic," as if they are more radical than the workers in advanced democratic countries. Have the Japanese really "awakened"?</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Jiayuan</p>
<p>Since Montgomery's visit to Moscow, the evolution of British-Soviet relations has once again attracted worldwide attention. Some say that the Anglo-Soviet alliance is not only continuing to be effective but will also be extended. Others say that Britain and the Soviet Union have signed a secret agreement to divide the spheres of influence in the Near East and the Balkans... But on the other hand, the Soviet Union is still criticizing Britain, saying that it has signed a secret agreement with the United States to jointly resist the Soviet Union, while Britain is also coldly mocking and blaming the Soviet Union for its faults. In fact, today's British-Soviet relations are no different from what they were before Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union. The world has paid too much attention to this episode of Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union!</p>
