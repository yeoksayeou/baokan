<p>附陋營事業機關人員待遇辦法：（一）國營事業機關人員之待遇，得根據其向來習慣自行規定，但其所得總額不得低於各級公敎人員相當等級所得百分之二十，亦不得高於百分之卅。（二）前項給與，係指薪俸，公費　一切津貼而言，此外，不得有任何變相之　　，上級主管機關應　時嚴格考核。（三）如年終決算營營業有盈餘時，經主管機關核准，得發給獎金，但至多不得超過三個月之所得額。（四）嗣後除公敎人員給與有調整時，國營事業機關人員待遇，亦得隨時調整外，國營事業機關人員欲調整其人員之給與時，須由主管上級機關嚴格審核，轉呈政院核准後，始得實施。（五）所有國營事業機關人員，均為公務員，應負有關公務人員服務之一切法令。（六）國營事業機關任用之外籍人員及特種技術人員，其給與不能依照本辦法規定辦理者，應報該管上級機關轉呈政院核定之。（七）本辦法實施後，所有國營事業機關人員原有之給與與本辦法坻觸者，應即廢止。</p>
<h3>張嘉璈等飛抵京　商洽調整匯率後有待補充事項　緊縮貸款適宜穩定物價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，副總裁劉攻芸，廿一日晨由滬飛抵京，將與財長兪鴻鈞商治關於頒布新外滙管理辦法後之其餘有待補充事項，卅六年美金債券之處理，亦為其中之一端。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕財次兼四聯總處秘書長徐柏園，日前為管理外匯及進出口貿易辦法之變更，赴滬主持執行後，廿一日晨已飛返京。據悉：今後國家行局庫放款方針，將切實配合國策，協助新結匯管理辦法之施行，各總行局庫為暫時緊縮放款業務，已電全國各分支行局庫遵行，京市各分行局已奉電令，暫停放款一星期。但據金融界觀察，結滙辦法更定，進出口貿易正值活躍，而秋收已屆，農作物源源登市之際，國家行局怱停放款，商業行莊自當緊縮，短期內銀根趨緊，當在意料之中。惟此項臨時措施雖對頭寸枯缺之戶有所影響，但對整個市場及穩定物便言，此舉甚為適宜。四聯總處放款小組委會，對申請貸款之審核，今後將更嚴格。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕聯合徽信所訊：出口物資是否以新外匯及進出口管理辦法之頒布而上漲，因而調整匯率後之利益乃告冲鎖，一般人員對此表示極度關切。記者今晨特以此問題叩詢財長俞鴻鈞氏，承答稱：自新外匯及進出口管理辦法頒布後，市塲反應尙稱良好，政府對於各種出口物品及一般物價已密切考慮注意，並擬有整個　體辦法，故不會有其它因素影響調整後之利益。</p>
<h3>對蘇續佔大連　美二次提抗議　所受損失蘇應負完全責任</h3>

<p>又訊：美政府對於蘇聯繼續佔領大連，提出抗議，抗議書聲明，美方在大連所受損失，蘇聯應負完全責任。</p>
<h3>徐滬直達通報</h3>

<h3>加強軍中敎育　實施巡廻講學</h3>
<p>國防部舉聘學者担任</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕據軍聞社訊：國防部為加强軍中敎育提萬官兵學員生政治知識，及增進其學術研究興趣，特聽請國內名敎授及專家學者，舉辦三十六年度車中巡迥講學，以陸·海·空·聯，各總部官員，各軍事學校學員生，靑年軍各師士兵，及靑年訓導隊收訓靑年為對象，　暫分二組舉行，第一組為京滬杭組，由講師四人擔任，內一人兼任，第二組為徐洛西安組，由講師三人據任，巡講時間定為一個半月，自八月中旬開始，預計於九月底講舉，並悉：講師任卓宣·張九如，陳鐘浩·許鴻已分別出發。</p>

<h3>我實施外匯新政策　美英評論觀測各異　華府官員懷疑英報認為可控制投機</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕美國官員二十日對於中國新外滙政策，，能否在貿質上，有助於刺激中美兩國貿易之增加，表示懷疑。渠等之意見，認為此項新政策，可能有暫時刺激中國出口貿易之結果，但此項效果在甚短期內，即將為中國普遍經濟之混亂局勢所减弱。渠等稱，由於新政策之結果，中國之若干商品業已漲價。此項政　顯然不能停止通貨膨脹，事實上可能刺激通貨膨脹。某消息靈通官員相信，此後之出口為猪鬃，織地毯之羊毛及其他奢侈品如戰前出口之刺綉品等，或能突然增加，但此實為中國貿易之不重要部分。渠指出中國重要出口之一桐油，由政府加以統制而輸出者，並不能獲得新外滙中四萬法幣對一萬元之利益，而仍保持一萬二千對一之滙率，中國生絲或將仍遭遇美國市場之拒絕，因生絲在美早已受到日本生絲之競爭，美政府企岡將生絲在美出售並未獲任何重大成功。</p>
<p>若干官員宣稱，此類辦法，如中國經濟紊亂及通貨膨脹之主要原因不除，決無成效可言。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日電〕華爾街日報華盛頓辦事處今預測中國之新外滙政策不致對中美商務有多大裨益。中國政府雖希望增進出口，减少進口，俾確立美元供應，而使貿易差額較有改良，然此事或不能成功。中國主要出口貨物（包括桐油與蛋絲）之展望，甚為暗淡。同時美國之高度進口稅，刻亦阻碍中國蛋類及胡桃之對美進口。戰事及交通之不便，復阻止猪鬃·羊毛·羊皮·駱駝毛之出口，然其中則有一錢光明希望，此即為中國之奢侈品出口。刻中國可自每一美元獲得更多之法幣，望中國之出口商，可以此項奢侈品供給新典之奢侈品消費者。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿日電〕倫敦泰晤士報經濟編輯今評論我國一新外匯辦法之決定，認為此舉為良好動向，可能因此刺激出口。渠稱，逐日訂定外匯匯率，實含有幾許彈性性質，因匯率可作上下移動，不必一逕上升也。此舉且可控制投機。渠表示中國政府可以恢復控制外匯市場於一時，但中國外滙任何永久平衡，除非兩項障礙去除後，則無法實現。其一為國家財政不斷虧絀，終至大量通貨聯脹；其二為運輸受阻，內地貨物運至港口者，無法暢其流。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港廿日電〕香港電訊報評論我政府新頒布之外滙政策稱，此舉對於挽救法幣之貶值有數種作用：（一）外國購買者可因之返回中國市場，因其金元已可獲得相當數量之貨品，而前此按照官定滙率，則只能購買此數之四分之一。（二）進出口商人可獲更多之自由，尤以前此必須按官價交易之外商為然。（三）增加僑民滙款，是為對於中國出口留易最有影響之事。總之，中國政府決心挽救外滙危機，當有成功之望。</p>
<h3>各地反應良好　平津物價趨穩</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿一日電〕今日為政府改訂管理外匯辦法之第五日，平市物價之安定，為歷次調整外匯所未有，連日商情雖稍有變化，但今日均退回原價，美紗亦疲至四萬二。綠以一般投機者，均無法估計政府究對輸入限度放寬至何種程度，故多抱觀望態度，且有恐虧本而相繼拋會者。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州二十一日電〕今日此間外幣市價極穩定，港幣終日在七二〇〇至七三〇〇之間，美鈔一元折港幣仍為五元一角。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島二十一日電〕靑市物價二十一日各貨平穩，美鈔市價四二五〇〇元。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津二十一日電〕津中國銀行二十一日美匯掛牌，買進三九八〇〇元，售出四一二〇〇元。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北廿日電〕台灣銀行今美鈔掛牌為進台幣五五七元七角，出六三八元四角，市價為進台幣七二零元，出七三零元，惟無大交易。金融市場未見波動，出口貨物則見上漲，一級砂糖每斤一六三六元，紅茶每斤二萬二千元，募龍茶二萬八千元，蓬萊米每斤四十元。</p>
<p>〔中一央社香港廿一日電〕我政府公布貿易外滙管理新辦法後，港出口貿易雖無顯著變動，惟買賣轉疏，市價趨跌，桐油每担一六一元，茶油百斤二〇五元，生絲每兩一元七角，閩茶下貨每担二二元。市况疲滯原因，主要為：（一）輸出管制放寬後，我特產品輸出中心，自港移滬。（二）國內輸出貨品漲價，淮商多持觀望熊度。</p>
<h3>陳總長由瀋抵平　傳作義孫連仲趕來晉謁</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿一日電〕陳誠總長廿一日晨惜隨員平轉京、熊式輝等平機塲送行。隨陳來濟之高張兩主任，陳科長等，因須辦未完公務，暫不返京。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕陳誠廿一日上午八時十分　　飛平，陳氏本定途次赴承德視察，惟飛至承德時，因狹窄之機場中心體有飛機，致未能降落，逕轉飛北平，於十時半到達北平西苑機場，因北平各方成得通知過晚，下機時僅有空軍站人員在場照料，當乘空軍吉普車進城，途中與李宗仁往迎汽車相遇，即相偕赴太平胡同招待所休息。下午何思源，吳奇偉，陳繼承，張伯瑾等首長往訪，六時一刻陳氏往訪胡適談話，歷四十五分鐘始辭出。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕陳總長來平後，北平即有重要集議，今午後此間當局先後派機赴張垣·保定·接傳作義，孫連仲來平參加。傳已於下午四時半到達，孫氏入時抵平。李宗仁晚八時宴陳總長，邀傅·孫等作陪，參後赴國民戲院觀馬連良之「紅　烈馬」。</p>
<h3>普選延期問題　須有法律根據　惠氏在滬談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕最近若干人士要求普選延期，各方對此咸極矚目，記者昨特往訪國府委員玉寵惠氏博士，叩詢意見，承王氏病中延見，對普選延期問題就法律觀點詳加批判，具見王氏對此問題之調切　熱誠。王氏稱：各地選舉事務　業已次第成立，所有普選準備工作，亦正積極展開，此時若　行決定停辦，其為違背國大決議，事極顯然，結果所至，勢將影　今後國大任何決議案之效力，老將直接影響政府之信譽，關係之重大，不言可知。綠政府對執行國大決議，在法律上及道德上陶有義務，因此，就政府之立場　對任何國大決議，即使明　在執行過程中可能遭遇重重困難，亦不應瞻迥徇顧，以此次普選而言，匯否執行係一問題，而能够執行至何種程度，顯　另一問題。依余個人意見，政府為表示切實履行憲法之精神，自應盡力依法辦理，不可作其他種種考慮。王氏繼稱：以上所云並非表示余欲抹殺彼要求延期者所舉之理由，實則余對彼等所見亦具同感，惟余所顧慮者，乃國大決議不可輕率更改，即有　辦之必要，亦需遵循合法手續，鄭重辦理。報載若干國大代表擬以通信方式徵求多數國大代表意見，決定延期與否，余對此項通信決定方式是否合法，終感懷疑。</p>
<h3>新疆吐魯番　武裝暴徒蠢動</h3>
<p>〔本報西寗十九日電〕新疆吐魯番武裝暴徒數百人，在某方策動下發生暴動，於七月十二日最四時改向駐勝金口國軍國襲，國軍為保衛而遷擊，暴徒敗溃，至鄯善之連木沁，漢墩及托克遜之庫木什等地，仍發現外酋指揮下之匪徒搶刧軍　情事，經還擊後亦溃散，現國軍協同新省府正在宣慰中，並未窮迫追究，但迪化市近發現國軍殺害土魯番人民之言，據此所知，顯係某方有計劃之挑撥，企圖破壞軍民情感，謠惑人心。</p>

<h3>魏使後日飛東京　向主席提備忘錄說不確　我財政資料即提交使團</h3>

<h3>聯總物資運共區事　中央委會對我建議　原則上已接受　對運輸時間路綫提出修正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總中國分署昨日宣佈：聯總中央執行委員會本月二十日於華府開會時，對華北停運物資事曾有所討論。中國政府對聯總之新建議原則上已接受，但於運輸之時間及路綫曾提出若干修正。原建議中要求中國政府同意以五萬噸物資運入共區，半數取道烟台遝入山東，半數沿天津南之運河進一入共區。時問之支配為八月份由烟台運一萬噸，九十兩月份兩處各運二萬噸。中國目前所同意者，為八月份經由烟台運一萬噸，沿運河綫之運輸時間及數量，暫時不作規定。聯總中央執行委員會二十日開會時，決定將中國政府之建議通知中共，並作協商。又，自八月八日至八月十五日一週中，計有船十二艘在上海，香港，福州及台灣卸下聯總物資一七·四八八長噸，至是運華物資統計已達二·二二七·二九一長噸。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日電〕聯總中央委員會今舉行會議三小時，考慮我政府對聯總輸送及分配救濟物資予華北共產黨控制區之建議案所提出之對案。可靠消息謂：中央委員會建議聯總中國公署，應以與中國政府已成立之協議為基礎，與中國共產黨獲致協議，俾向烟台輸送物資。同時，聯總對於總量八萬九千噸之扣發物資，仍有決定權，其中五萬噸，原標明輸往中共區，餘供給國民政府區域。委員會進一步建議：與中國共產黨獲致協議後，輸烟台之第一批物資，將達一萬噸，輸往中國政府區之數量，可望增至二萬五千噸，推倘聯總駐華辦事處未克以其與中國政府已成立之協議為基礎，與中共成立協議，則此問題，將再度交還中央委員會討論。據悉：委員會之建議，並規定凡經由烟合轍往中國共產黨區之物資，必須經中央政府許可，及遵守下列條件：即物資不得被共產黨利用，作為軍事用遂，且應由聯總及行聯委員監督物資之分配。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>從學費問題談到搶救失學</h3>
<p>兩個多月的暑假，轉瞬就要期滿，大中小各級學校，都要在最近的幾個星期內開學了。這是三十六年度第一學期的開始，上學期小學畢業的，這一學期可以進初中，初中畢業的可以進高中，高中畢業的可以進大學，在求學過程上，都已獲得了一個新的進展；就是在原校求學的，也都可以昇一級。對於一般學生而言，在二個多月的暑假期滿之後，換一個新的環境，本應怎樣的興奮與愉快，盼望學校早日開學。但是在現行的情况之下，除了富有之家的子弟以外，大多數的靑年學生，都為了這學期的學費而發愁。家長也終日愁眉苦臉，在那裏打算如何籌措這一筆大支出；所以這幾天來，私立學校的收費問題，已成了當前最迫切的問題了。</p>
<p>本市私立專科以上的學校，在前一星期，曾舉行一次校長會議，決定這一學期徵收學費的標準，最低為二百萬元：詳情暫守秘密，外界尙不得而知；名私立中小學校長，前天也開過一次會議，決定學雜費的標準：是小學六十萬元，初中九十萬元，高中一百二十萬元。消息傳出。不僅已引起一般學生及家長的恐慌；而且也已引起社會的注意；市敎育局方面，並定於本日午後，招待大中小各級學校校長懇談，為一般貧苦的學生呼籲，請各校自動减低學雜費。</p>
<p>平心而論，在目前的經濟局勢之下，今後物價的高漲勢所難免；為一般敎師的生活着想，大中小各級學校增加學雜費，似乎未可厚非；但是辦理敎育與其性質的事業，終究有些不同。學校當局不能不顧及學生的經濟能力，決不可採取『無錢讀書莫進來」的態度，而聽任其失學或輟學。我們再按之事實，自本年一月至七月，物價上漲的倍數為三倍有半，但是校長會議所決定的收費標準，已在三倍半以上，似乎漲得太多了。至於校長會議決定增加收費，雖以改善敎師的待退為理由，但是依據過去各校的實際情形，敎師薪給增加的倍數，終在學費增加的倍數之下。所以我們認為各校校長對於收費標準，尙有重加考慮的必要！</p>
<p>在目前的環境之下辦理敎育，比較任何事業為困難；但是在建國期間，敎育第一，所謂「百年樹人」，敎育應該是國家的百年大計。照理，不論是大中小各級學校，都應該由國家辦理，但是國家在八年抗戰之後，元氣大傷，再加以共匪的稱兵作亂，使國家所有的精力，均將　耗殆　；以敎育最發達的上海市而論，據敎育局國民敎育處的報告，全市入學兒童，共計四十萬人，共中有廿五萬人入私立小學，僅有十五萬人入市立小學。而這一學期，各市小又因經費的支絀，均不能增加班次，準此而論，今後上海市初等敎育的推進，仍有賴私立學校的協助。所以社會人士對於各級私立學校，不僅不應抱着鄙棄的態度，而且應該隨時予以扶持。卽對於收費問題，也應該顧全各方面，謀得合理的解決；切不可高談闊論，不問事實上的困難，強令各學校減低收費，致使各學校校務無法進行。</p>
<p>要之，預料這學期的學費卽將激增，勢必有一部份的學生，因無力繳費而失學了。社會對此，決不可袖手旁觀，而應早作準備，擴大助學的數量與範圍，庶使這些淸寒學生不致徘徊於校門之外。本報為搶救失學靑年起見，已決定再度舉辦助學金。為社會倡導，探望各界人士，本着「助學最樂」之義，大家慷慨解囊，獻捐助學金，使上海市不致看成羣的失學靑年！</p>
<h3>關懷四川水災</h3>
<p>行政院十九日會議，通過救濟蘇省川省水災兩案。據本報京電，政府救濟蘇北徐海兩屬及淮屬等十七縣市水災，共七項緊急救濟辦法，治本治標兼施併行；這對於蘇北災黎，不失為可貴的慰安。關於川省水災救濟，辦法尙不可知，迭據坊聞報道，及京滬川籍人士的呼籲，川省水災情况，相當嚴重，急待各方的救濟，所以我們對於川省災患，無限關懷。</p>
<p>四川號稱「天府之國」，面積廣大，人日衆多，物產豐富，農業生產居西南各省之冠，手工業輕工業，，十年來更有飛躍發展的紀錄。抗戰八年，國府陪都重慶，政府與人民，得天時·地利·人和之助，完成抗戰勝利，八年中無一次水患，亦未遭一次旱災，歲歲豐收，人地安泰。今年大江南北，天災人禍頻仍，川省不幸，亦罹水患。成都為構華所聚，幾成一片在洋，岷江沱江及涪江流域，橫斷川西北各縣，為農業生產富庶之區，兩月來遭兩次大水，沿江災民遍佈，公路冲毀無法通車，損失詳情及災民數字，至今尙無法統計。僅成都一市，現無家可歸災民，即有十餘萬之多，財產損失，在百億以上。據川省人士說，今年川省的大水災，實為八年來所未有，人民受此浩刧，省政府僅一紙救濟空文、誰會給他們些溫情？誰會佈施他們些實惠？川省災民，走投無路，無計可施，眼看大由園秋收無望，治安可慮，他們如何活得了！</p>
<p>現在政院通過救濟川省水災案，京滬人士復有募款賬救之舉，這對於川人心理上，必發生極大的慰安與鼓舞。從這次抗戰的經過言，四川對於國家民族，曾有極大的貢獻：可謂抗戰的根據地；以言兵役，四川貢獻的人力是第一位；以言徵糧徵借，四川貢獻的物力是第一位；以　捐輸公債懄募，四川貢獻的財力是第一位。中國沒有四川，對日抗戰不能堅持到八年之久。抗戰八年中，沒有四川人民的忠誠合作，後方不能有那樣的穩定。抗戰勝利屆兩年，中央不應忘了四川，上海工商業不應忘了四川，曾寄居川省的南北人士不應忘了四川，無論從那方面說，四川遭受大水患、皆應對四川寄予同情，惠予援助。這并非恩情的報答，而是人類應具有的良知，應具有的正義。我們　懷川省水災，願各方人士能有更大的關懷，大家伸出援助的手來。</p>
<p>我們還要指出，川省這次水災的釀造，自然的因素居半，水利不振，人謀不臧實為水災最太因素。成都附風十餘縣，物產甲全用，其農田灌溉，潔於灌縣都江一　，然都江堰水利工程，仍為原始狀態，未臻現代化，加以史治欠淸，管理欠科學，都江堰不僅未造福人羣，反為人民生聚之禍，這是行政上的錯誤。我們關懷四川水災，更關切川省地方行政，及農田水利之建設，希望主管當局接受這次水災的敎訓，有所警惕！</p>

<h3>英美法會商德工業水準　蘇聯突提出抗議　謂此舉違反波茨坦協定　美決置不理仍定下週一在英開會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿一日廣播：關於提高德國工業水準之英美法三國談判，蘇聯已提出抗議。據美官方消息，美國務院已接獲蘇聯牒文一件，內容反對三強會議，認為此種會談，實已違反波茨坦協定。據美官方表示：美政府決對蘇聯抗議　諸不理，而遵照原來計劃，繼續進行一切。三強會談法於下週一在倫敦展幕。同樣性質之蘇聯抗議，已送達巴黎與倫敦。蘇聯此次抗議，其最大原因，乃由於法國已允許提高德國鋼鐵生產。按四強原已同意將德國鋼產限為每年五百八十萬噸，僅及一九三八年水準百分之五十。蘇聯認為舉凡一切提高德工業產量之行動，蘇聯有權參加與顧問。先是英美已同意在英美佔區內提高德工業產量，以便支持馬歇爾復興歐洲之計劃。美方堅持戰爭賠償不應取自現行生產，但莫洛托夫在歷次會議中，均主張自德國現行生產內，獲取賠償。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿日電〕此間美大使館宣稱：德境美軍總司令克萊中將及其政治顧問將於二十，一日乘機來倫敦，參加三强討論德國工業水準之會議。同時，國務部經濟安全司司長馬丁及德奧組組長茄可伯亦將來此，任陶格拉斯大使之顧問。</p>
<h3>停止以英鎊兌換美元　英美已成立諒解　美對英貸款剩餘部份暫不動用</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿日電〕財長道爾頓今日突然宣布金鎊暫時停止兌換美元、同時華盛頓消息，美國已同意採取緊急措施，防止英國美元儲備之涸竭。道爾頓之布告稱：今日午夜後，凡與英國政府或商行交易或因外滙買賣而獲得之金鎊之人，不再有將此項金鎊兌換美元之自動權利，但所謂美國存戶不在此限。目前英國經濟至爲嚴朮，截至七月底止，英國在卅七億五千萬美元貸款中已提取二十七億五千萬美元。自八月十日以來，又提取二億四千二百萬元，僅餘七億五千八百萬元，故美元不得不加節省。但持有金鎊之人得自由兌換美元以外之貨幣。限制美元兌換殆又難免引起商業方面之騷亂甚至妨碍一部份供應，殊可扼腕，但非得已。假令吾人遲疑不前，則形勢將愈惡化，深望各方諒解政府此種決定乃賢明措施，僅欲維持金鎊之堅定基礎，使成國際貨幣。此種措施亦可謂爲海外之接濟將繼續缺乏，甚至國內早已稀少的糧食配給亦將更爲减少，在此種緊急情形之下，賴惰實為罪惡，吾人欲恢復國家經濟，捨苦幹別無他道云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕英美經濟會議今日進入第三天，美國同意採取緊急措施制止英國美元存底趨於枯竭，英方則同意不再動用三十七億五千萬美元貸款中剩餘部份，以待磋商，並下令暫停英鎊自由兌換美金。此項決定已在華府與倫敦兩地同時宣佈，華府方面係由財政部長史奈特與副國務卿羅維特聯名簽署發表聲明。</p>

<h3>美要求將巴爾幹糾紛案　列入聯大議程　以對抗蘇聯濫用否決權</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿日電〕美國今日正式提議以巴爾幹糾紛案交由九月間聯合國全體大會討論，此乃蘇聯在安理會一再施用否決權及該會承認無力解決此案之結果。美代表詹森希望大會仃動，以制止希臘政治獨立與領土完整所受威脅。聯合國機構秘書長輯依擔保此一問題將列入大會臨時議程。按蘇蘇聯代表葛羅米柯昨日曾要求聯合國機構召回駐巴爾幹視察團，經賴依堅決拒絕，據賴氏向報界稱：巴爾幹調查委員會視察小組係奉安理會命令留駐希臘，將繼續留駐以待復命云。蘇聯認爲兩次使用否決權，巳自調查會及其小組自動淸算，此種態度使若干方面揣測蘇聯與波　或將立即退出調查會及其小組，但葛羅米柯與波代襲迄無表示。無論如何該小紙將被拒絕進入希臘鄰邦之蘇聯各附屬國，則無疑問。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾促美洲各國團結　保障西半球安全　聯防公約下月七日簽字</h3>

<h3>建立獨立統一朝鮮問題　漢城會議瀕破裂　美方準備交回四強處理</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日電〕據可靠方面訊：現在漢城舉行之美蘇混合委會，其結果料將完全破裂，南北韓佔領區之統一亦必告失敗，故美國聞已準備將整個朝鮮問題，交回莫斯科公約四簽字國（中美英蘇）處理。據日本所獲漢城消息，顯示蘇聯對馬歇爾八月十三日向莫洛托夫要求委員會就朝鮮提出充分報告一節，將不表同意。</p>
<p>又悉：美官員對朝鮮問題交四强處理後，能否獲得成功之解決，僅抱極少希望，而準備將其提交聯合國考慮，幷作最後決定。美官方對朝鮮問題之態度，或可於八月廿一日左右宣佈，是日爲馬歇爾指定委員會提出報告之期。據悉：出席漢城委會之美代表團，明日將向國務院提出報告以供考慮，美國幷將計劉採取何種步驟，以完成莫斯科協定建立一獨立統一之朝鮮。</p>
<p>韓共野心　益形露骨</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約二十日電〕「芝加哥每日新聞」記者赫爾斯，頃自漢城發電稱，此東方多事之地，已充滿恐懼共產大規模煽動革命暴發之情緒。據稱，企圖以武力佔領韓國之各種步驟主要計劃之副本，已落於美軍當局手中。蘇聯軍隊在此問所採取之初步行動，如在若干巴爾幹國家所採取之步驟相同，即訓練並裝備韓北軍隊，據估計，該處受訓之軍隊約十五萬人，最近可能已增至五十萬人。此間盛傳約有此等軍隊八萬人，正在中國東北作戰之中國共軍中接受作戰訓練。</p>
<h3>漢城會議展望</h3>
<p>— 潘世憲</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>美蘇兩國駐軍佔領朝鮮的情形，說來是與歐洲方面美英法蘇四國駐軍佔領德國的情形相似。在德國各佔領區壁壘分明，最近馬歇爾的援歐計劃與英法領導的歐洲經濟復興會議，已經與蘇聯的東歐集團形成了尖銳的對立。在朝鮮北緯三十八度界錢劃分，情形自然也很易瞭解。說到這裏，我不由得要替朝鮮人民表示一點不平之鳴。德國是納粹正兇，是第二次世界大戰的主犯之一，在今天遭受瓜分的統治是咎由自取；朝鮮則不然，她是遭受了日本帝國主義統治過四十餘年的民族，她也是經過盟國中四大國家保證過予以解放獨立的地域。而今分割佔領的情形，非僅使朝鮮人無法建立其統一獨立的國家、甚且使朝鮮人民無法解決其最低的個人生活問題。這一點，在曾允許協助朝鮮解放獨立的四大國家，都應該作深刻的反省。</p>
<p>美蘇沘合委員會今年復會以來，又已經兩個多月了。就漢城方面傳出的消息看，又重陷於去年五月以後的　局之中。擱淺的問題仍與去年一樣，仍舊是對朝鮮所有政黨團體的取捨問題。這情形短期內是不會解決的。魏德邁將軍尚未到朝鮮，等到魏將軍向美國務院提出關於朝鮮的報告以後，漢城會議立即可以反映出問題的解決或破裂的結果來。朝鮮問題不能在朝鮮解決，是決定於華盛頓與莫斯科的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>現階段中，美蘇雙方意見對立的政黨諮詢資格問題，只是美蘇會議的僵　的表面文章，實際上的問題乃是美蘇兩國各自對於「民主」解釋的問題。倘若兩種解釋可以慢慢接連，則朝鮮政黨問題亦可漸次解決。</p>
<p>除了上述的基本問題以外”還有些實際問題是頗難解決的。</p>
<p>第一：在朝鮮內政關係上，將來朝鮮南北統一政府成立以後，其土地政策將如何加以調整。這問題是頗値得事前研究的。在日本投降以後，美軍佔領區中，是由美方主持組成的新朝鮮公司接收了日人的土地，將來究如何分配給朝鮮人民，當然還應硏究。在蘇軍佔領區中，其接收與處置方法均不同。蘇聯在朝鮮北部不僅接收了日人的土地，並且也沒收了朝鮮人地主的土地，現在已經將這些接收沒收的土地分給了農民。前傳數千名朝鮮人偸越三十八度封鎖綫逃到美軍佔領區的，即是這些地主。美方是反對蘇方這種土地政策的，雙方政策旣然不同，而又各行其是，時間愈久，則間題愈難解決。</p>
<p>第二：在軍事組織方面，在美蘇兩佔領區裏，都進行着公開的或秘密的，正規的或非正規的軍事訓練計劃。蘇軍在朝鮮北部訓練朝鮮紅軍的報導已經傳遍了世界，此外，所謂共產主義靑年團的訓練，治安警察的訓練，亦均可以說是變形的軍事訓練。至於在朝鮮南部方面，雖然流亡在中國曾經實際與盟軍併屆對日作戰的朝鮮光復軍及朝鮮義勇隊，都被拒不准武裝返韓，但是，目前美佔領軍還是批准了以曾充日軍曹長的朝鮮人任敎官的軍官學校的設立。其他各種團體的軍事訓練與警察的政治軍事訓練，也是非常積極的。爲了維持地方治安，在沒有美軍駐屯的地方，又在組織地方警備隊。這也是一種軍事訓練與組織。</p>
<p>第三。在外交關係方面，日前無論朝鮮北部人民委員會或朝鮮南部臨時政府，所有與美蘇兩國所發生的關係，都不能認爲正常的外交關係，因爲雙方的朝鮮主體當局都沒有經過國際承認的。但是，美蘇兩國旣然都與她所扶持的政權發生了關係，而且取得了她所企求的利益，那末，在將來朝鮮組織統一政府，談判繼承兩地方政權的權利義務的時候，美蘇兩國又怎甘放棄其旣得權益呢？據傳蘇聯已與朝鮮北部人民委員會簽訂一種協定，朝鮮北部將允許蘇聯使用朝鮮的水道，公路及不凍港，此項協定的有效期問是三十年。將來刺鮮統一政府成立後，蘇聯是否肯放棄此項權益？如該項協定仍有效，那末是否也適用於朝鮮南部？美國方而是否也將要求同等的權利？這種條約對於朝鮮的獨立是否有問題？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>漢城會議，前途雖然未可樂觀，但是爲了三千萬朝鮮人民的死活問題，美蘇兩國應該用一切可能的手段來打開這僵局。倘美蘇兩國皆認爲直接商談的方法，像去年五月以前及目前所舉行談判方式，不能獲得結論，則亦可以改變方式。如果美蘇兩國均有誠意打開僵局，而願考慮比較中立，和緩，折衷的意見，是否可以邀請中英兩國參加解決朝鮮問題的談判。如此可以易於覓取調和折衷的意見，獲得合理解決朝鮮問題的方法。相信這是朝鮮人民所股切期待的。但是，總括一句，漢城會議的前途，　　於美蘇兩國有無解決朝鮮問題的誠意。</p>

<h3>浴業職工　請願風波　搗毀大觀園　理事長負傷　肇事四十四人被捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市西門浴室職工暨浴室業工會會員四百餘人，為要求釋放被捕之二職工，曾於前晚五時赴市府謁吳市長未遇，昨日上午十時，復往市府請願。當局以被捕工人，行爲越軌，業已移解法院訊辦，故未予接兌，請願羣衆，迄下午一時始散，沿途並勸告同業加入請願。詎至午後一時半，該業職工百餘人，因赴市府請願未得結果，整隊赴泥城橋大觀園浴室，要求現任浴業公會理事長之經理楊少雄，答復此次未能調處之原因。楊見來勢汹汹，恐生意外，即避於三樓小擱上，拒不出見，致觸衆怒，一部份職工竟將該園設備先予搗毀，繼即上樓衝進櫊樓。擱小人多，突然坍倒，楊當塲身受重傷。老　警分局很悉，即派大批員警到塲，將肇事工友拘獲四十四名帶局偵訊，並將受傷者車送醫院醫治。</p>
<p>據社會局勞工處長沈　表示：該浴室勞資糾紛，早經成立調解筆錄，原定於昨日復工，該浴室主人因惑於　信，堅欲　吉開張，致化誤會云。又據另一方面消息：資方於日前呈報社會局備案，聲稱將非　怠工生動職工彭兆麟，孔　實筆等十三人開除。社會局現函請蓬萊警局將此次勞資糾紛案處理經過見復後，再行核辦。</p>
<h3>公用事業請求調整價格　市府派員晉京報告請示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府實施外匯管制新辦法後，本市各公用事業成本勢將加重，而中央又曾有不准漲價以免刺激物價之規定，市府公用局爲欲使公用事業暫維原價，並顧及資方虧損起見，特派該局技術室主任徐肇霖及電務科長劉盛渠，於前晚晋京，向全國經濟委員會報告，並有所請示，定於今晨返滬。據悉，渠等赴京之主要目的，係請求中央對公用事業所需之燃料配件等，撥予官價外匯。若中央配煤之價格准予照舊，則本市之公用事業可望不漲云</p>
<p>據確悉：各公用事業公司請求調整價格之呈文，及收支細册，業經分別呈交公甩局，正在精密審核中。准予調整與否，俟徐主任等回滬後當可決定。</p>
<h3>預防物價波動　社局籌儲食米</h3>

<h3>電影延遲漲價　附加災捐　辦法未定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〔影院業允負祖兩廣及蘇北水災捐款卅億，惟因各院難於決定分担標準，目外國片商對此不表同意，社會局長吳開先昨乃表示將改變辦法，擬在每一電影票上附征若干水災捐，由財政局代收解繳。此項水災捐，須待提送參議會通過方可征收，故電影票原定增價百分之百，現如另行附征水災捐，則所漲成數將告减低。吳局長對此事將於今晨之市政會議中提出報告，故電影票加價事勢將延遲。</p>

<h3>市府明年度預算　目前尚無法編製</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市明年度市府預算，因收支相差過鉅，目前尚無法編製。昨據市府會計處長閔　帆語記者：已請各局處儘量核减支出，設法增加收入，如整頓稅收等，各部門之預算，僅限於明年度之經常維持費。臨時費用及新建事業費，俟明年市財政好轉時再予設法。上項預算，日內當可交到，若總數仍超過收入時，將再請核减，務以量入爲出爲原則。</p>

<h3>行總簿籍浩繁　檢閱偵查費時　徐劉互毆和解有望　分配廳長改期北飛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總新任總務處處長畢高奎已於昨日視事，其前任徐世長今後將專任專員職務。徐雖表示決對曾與其互毆之行總振卹廳福利組主任劉德　進行訴訟，然據行總若干職員稱，徐劉本屬至親，且劉之　砧向景雲（行總調查處長）昨已由湘飛返上海，故本案當有和解之望。</p>
<p>行總目六高級職員被控集團貪汚事發生後，空氣頗形緊張。但據　熟悉行總情形者稱，當局調查工作，進行頗多困難，以行總案卷簿籍之浩繁，非但需要相當之時間，尤需若干對技術工作極爲熟悉之專家，否則以行總如許物資之估價而論，恐即將發生無所適從之感。至外傳行總副署長李卓敏大權獨攬之說，則李氏於前署長蔣廷黻氏辭職時，確曾堅請辭職，而由霍署長堅留。霍氏因一切對外聯絡事務甚忙，故署中一切行政及人事方而事務，確係交李氏全權辦理。</p>
<p>劉廣沛被控　已非第一次</p>
<p>又該署東北分署署長一職，自劉廣沛撤職後，現已決定由該分署副署長南秉方繼任。據確悉，行總早在去年秋冬之間，即擬將劉內調總署顧問，並着現任賑卹廳長之盧廣綿繼任劉職，惟明令發表後，又因其他關係，收回成命，仍由劉氏留任。然劉之被控，此次實已非第一次，故此次該署分配廳長在伏生奉命前往調查，即曾携有專門人負若干人，傅從事較精密之考核工作。在氏本定昨日起程，因故改期。監察使署方面，嚴監察使除表示正在嚴查外，但對實際調查情形，嚴守緘默。據行總方面稱：監察使署並未派員前往該署調查。</p>
<p>重要賑目上　檢閱後蓋章</p>
<p>地檢處承辦該案之何惠民檢察官，因有其他案件待理，昨未赴行總及有關機關偵查。據談，行總賬一册浩如瀚海，一時難有端緒。惟在重要賬目上於查閱後加董渠之印章，以防塗改。至於封存賬册單據之舉，恐影響該署公務，尚未考慮及此。</p>
<p>至晋京述職之署長霍實樹，已定今日返滬。</p>

<h3>顏料號擅營拆放　經副理同被起訴</h3>

<h3>好男兒要當兵　兵役是國民義務　徴集時期談談應徽手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市今年應徵兵額三千人，國防部令於下月十五日前徵集完畢，兵役協會日前開會決定，志願兵自本月廿五日起開始登記，新兵營房也在開始修理，限半月完成，即行人營受訓。可是截至目前，很多人對於役政的各項設施，辦法及應徵手續還捉摸不淸，爲使讀者對於役政推行獲得明確的了解，我們在這裏作一次簡要的說明：</p>
<p>本市配賦兵額，當局規定征募兼施，就是說儘先募集志願兵，不足的數，前依法征足。按照人口比例，上海應徵六千人，上海因是國防工業重地，免緩役人數較多，减配爲三千名。依據戶籍調查結果，本市現役及齡男子共有二三一，五三七名，以三千名比例分配，平均七十七人中出兵一名、一般看法，認爲三千名志願兵很容易募足，果爾，今年上海便可免征了，萬一不足時，就　法征集。</p>
<p>兵役征集前，需要經過身家調查，壯丁申請審查，體格檢查，抽籤等四個步驟。本市的身家調查工作，早已完成，現在正在辦理壯丁申請審查中，這步工作，包括免緩役的申請與審查，牽涉範圍很廣，也最　劇，所以費時較久，假如這步工作做得好，以後體格檢查，抽籤工作，也就容易進行。</p>
<p>免禁緩召幾種規定</p>
<p>壯丁申請免役，禁役，緩役，緩召，限於下列幾種：（一）身體畸形殘廢或有痼疾不堪服役者（附醫師及保甲長證明書）（二）凡曾判處七年以上有期徒刑者，（附判決書），（三）因公出國者（附具政府核准證明書或其他證明文件），（四）高中以上學校學生未畢業者（附學校證明書），（五）犯最重本刑爲有期徒刑以上之刑罪在追訴中，或犯罪處徒刑在執行中者（附法院起訴書及其他證明文件或判決書），（六）現任有關國防工業之專門技術員工經審查核定者（附畢業證書，技術訓練合格證書，及主管機關服務證明書），（七）曾在敎育認育之師範學校畢業，現任小學敎師一年以上，經審查合格者（附審查合格證書），（八）獨負家庭生計責任而無同胞兄弟者，或有同胞兄弟而均已應召或均未滿十八歲者，（附保甲長證明書或在營服役證明書），（九）患病經證明不堪服作戰任務者（附醫師證明書），（十）高中以上學校畢業取得軍訓及格證書之各機關公務人員（附軍訓及格證書及機關主管長官證明書）。此外，凡是及齡壯丁，都在應徵之列。最近共方駐行總代表紀鋒，雖當現役年齡，吳市長認爲他已失了服役的資格，不准服役，由這些，我們正視服兵役對國家是一椿神聖的義務，背叛國家的人，不容玷辱國法的尊嚴。</p>
<p>主辦役政幾個機關</p>
<p>申請免緩役後，最初經保調查，次經區審核，最後由市政府及兵役協會召開審查會會同復核，並將核准免緩役壯丁的名單，分發各區公佈，此項工作，即告完成。然後就定期檢查體格，進行抽　的工作，中籤的壯丁，待命征集入營。</p>
<p>本市主管役政機關，除民政處之外，上海師管區司令部及上海團管區司令部，是兩個負責監督與訓練新兵的軍事機關，兵役協會依法是由各機關首長組成，協助推行役政的。該會下設宣傳，優待，體格檢查，免緩役審查，抽籤及監交等六委員會。關於志願兵的優待辦法，該會已經決定，每家發給安家費五萬元，安家補助費四百萬元，此項費用由免緩役壯丁，分甲（三十萬元），乙（十五萬元），丙（三萬元）三級，於發給免緩役證書時繳充，不足的數目，由不出壯丁的戶口捐助，辦法正在擬定中。至於志願兵徵集辦法，可向保辦公處索取志願兵應徵申請書及介紹保證書，塡註淸楚，經加蓋名章後，一併送繳保辦公處，報名（即登記）後，在原住地聽候通知體格檢查，檢查合格者，就送到新兵徵集所聽候撥交。在手續上，志願兵較應征壯丁要簡單些。</p>
<p>志願兵登記極踴躍</p>
<p>截至目前，自願投効，請充任志願兵，遵從國家法令，服務兵役的，一位是年已五十的曹祥霖，現任英商電車公司出納，他要用自已的熱忱，替上海二十三萬壯丁打一劑强心針，函請吳市長破例推薦。另有二位是國民黨上海市第六區黨部五分部執行委員並書記顧野菴及黨員方世豪，響應蔣主席的號召，率先申請志願服役，尚有多少知名不知名的志士，正紛紛請求登記爲志願兵。</p>
<p>相反的，征兵無端，販賣壯丁的醜劇，近來已迭有發生，經查獲的已有數起，吳市長表示決予嚴辦，傅正模司令盼望市民據實檢舉，張曉崧處長希望能獲得各方面的合作，把戰時役政的腐化現象，除惡務盡，使上海的　政，列爲全國的楷模。</p>

<h3>北塔山以北的來客　達公爺懷舊　布爾根河上怒潮澎湃　士旂駱駝銀鈴嗚咽</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日訊〕「總要在東土爾其斯坦運動的聲浪中讓人們知道新省還存有蒙古盟旂。」這是吳忠信先生當年任新疆省主席時慨然說出的一句話，在目前，哈薩克同胞在北塔山受難之際，又使人記憶起來。二十年前，在北塔山以北，富庶的布爾根河流械，十一個盟旂的蒙古同胞，早已陷入了魔掌。</p>
<p>達木鼎策德恩，是新疆蒙古霍碩特旂的扎薩克鎭國公，過了二十多年的流浪生活，在週前來到首都，見到了吳文官長，受聘爲蒙藏委會的顧問，不久就將回到蘭州去住。</p>
<p>二十年來　迄無蜜日</p>
<p>當記者訪到他時，通過了譒譯陳士鐸先生，他興舊的訴說着當年的史實和這二十九年來的心情，他思念着他生長起來的布兩根河上的沃土，　草，羊羣，牧夫。「民國二年，中俄和中蒙間訂定關於科不多與阿爾泰間的轄區和駐界劃分的約文以後，民國三年北京政府派了三個委員去查勘邊界，各旂都選派了旂官隨行，那時我才二十九歲，曾親自在阿爾泰的邊界上走過一趟。後來，阿爾泰改設阿山道，我們霍碩特一旂，札哈欽一旂和新土爾扈特二旂等，共四旂，設置布爾根縣，另外，烏梁海七旂，設置淸河縣，阿山額魯特蒙古十一旂過了十年平靖日子。但是到民國十四年陰曆四月里，禍患突然來了，外蒙軍越過邊界入侵，兩縣十一旂的人民，土地，財產，全部遭刦。十一旂的札薩克速我一共才逃出了三個。我當時到迪化後，見到楊增新督辦，他也主張我晋京一行，但是因爲交通不便，就沒有如願，後來，金樹仁作督辦時，情形已不許可行動，到盛世才時代，根本就不要談到內地來。最近北塔山又被侵入了，張主任便讓我來一次南京，把地方上的情形報告給當局知道。二十年來，北塔山以北從來沒安定過一天，淸河，布爾根，察汗通古，終至距阿爾泰科布多邊界六百多里的北塔山也受到了侵襲。</p>
<p>牧場金窮　寶藏無窮</p>
<p>停一停，他談起阿山區的富庶情形來：</p>
<p>「布爾根河流域是最好的牧塲，而且還有不少墾田，鳥梁悔七旗地方（淸河縣），是金礦最豐的區域。當地的人民從來過着富足的日子，獸皮，畜產，金銀，石油，數不　的寳藏。在兩條淸河（安樂河），一條察汗河（白河），一條布爾根河（泉河）等四條水滙流下游不遠處，一個呌作那倫滿圖（太陽興旺）的地方，有一座伏臥着的駱駝形狀的山丘，雪白的銀礦整個露出來，底下還不知道有多深。但是如今一切都完了。」</p>
<p>一座　牆　只進不出</p>
<p>「十一旂的蒙胞如今過得好嗎？他們想不想回來？」記者的問話使他臉上泛起苦笑。</p>
<p>「外蒙的疆界做一座錢　，進去就不用想出來，在迪化祗偶然有偷偸越界的商民來看我，說十一旗的人民生活，在征丁征物的壓榨下，連把自家的羊殺一隻來吃的自由都沒有。他們一致都希望能回到祖國來。這是國家的事，我相信國家不會放棄這一大塊豐籲的領士，更不會放棄成萬的愛養讓胞。」</p>
<p>「我們也希望那相當浙江一省大小的領土能很快的收回來，達公爺可以早日看到你旗下的人民。」記者在告辭時這樣說。</p>
<p>「啊！這是我今生唯一期望着的事呀！」他聲音激動得感人，我好像從他眼　裏看見零白的銀駱駝。（記者濮德玠）</p>

<h3>黃金外幣買賣黑市　國行決定加緊查緝　告密獎金不受財務罰鍰細則限制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕修正中央銀行管理外滙辦法，業經公佈實施。今後對於取締外幣黑市如何加强，又獎勵告密人之獎金，是否不受財務罰銀提獎分配細則第五條之限制，記者昨特向國行有關方面探詢。據稱：該行對於查緝黃金外幣黑市買賣，並未一日停頓。茲爲配合實施修正外滙管理辦法起見，對黃金外幣黑市買賣，自　加强澈查取締。其不法經營僑滙者，亦包括在內。倘經發現，當根據修正管理外滙辦法第卅二條之規定：「除沒收其外滙外，並處經理人五年以下之徒刑」。至於獎勵告密人之獎金，財政部曾制定告密黃金外幣買賣獎勵辦法，於本年三月以前，通飭遵行。查財務罰鍰提獎分配細則第五條：「提給舉發人之獎金，每案每人不得超過國幣三千萬元，主辦機關提給在事出力人員之獎金，每案每人不得超過三百萬元」之規定，原爲一般稅務罰鍰而設。而取締黃金外幣黑市買賣情形特殊現已商得財政部同意，對於獎勵告密人獎金，可不受該財務罰鍰提獎分配細則第五條規定之限制。此外並詢及市面銀根最近緊縮之原因何在，渠稱：政府現正催繳三十五年度直接稅，限定全年稅收應於本年八月底前全部繳淸。該項稅收，預計在上海一地，本月內可收入四千億至五千億元，故預料市面銀根，最近必現緊縮之象云。</p>
<h3>香港政府協助我國　取締走私消滅黑匯　協定備忘錄雙方代表已簽字</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據消息靈通方面透露：我國與香港政府，曾爲取締華南進出口走私，及消滅香港外滙外幣黑市諸問題，迭經洽商談判，終於本年八月十五日，獲得最後協議，並於是日在港正式交換協定之備忘錄（Memorandum　of　Agreement）。我國由中央銀行派赴香港談判之該行業務局副局長邵曾華代爲簽字，港方則由香港政府財政廳長福祿氏代爲簽字。</p>
<p>據悉：協定中對我國華南經港轉口之出口貿易結滙辦法，有詳確之規定。即華南出口貨，經廣州轉香港出口者，出口商應先將出口滙票，以港幣數値，結售予廣州之指定銀行。該項港幣外滙，以基金方式，存於香港。至該項港幣外滙之又付及動用方式，經規定四點：（一）香港政府對外輸入貨品，得動用之。（二）我國對外輸入貨品，亦得動用之。（三）基金經一定時期之支付及動用後，仍有餘額時，應結還予我國。（四）第三國之輸入貿易，不得動用該項基金。</p>
<p>基於上述之協議，香港政府決定：（一）協助我取締華南走私，（二）協助我消滅港地國幣與外滙外幣比率之黑市價。聞港政府對此次洽議經過，頗表誠意。良以香港經濟之生命綫，與華南息息相關，故處處應覓求密切之合作。港政府希望我應維持其應有及合法之中港貿易，勿予歧視。至協定全部條文，有於八月廿三日，由我及港政府同時發表之說。蓋港政府爲澈底執行協定中之規定計，現有之各有關行政機構，勢須經過一番調整及準備，以備協定公佈後，即予嚴格週密執行。據某權威人士觀察：我與港政府此次簽訂協定，復以國內頒行修正進出口貿易及外滙管理辦法，相互後先配合，則此綿延已近二載之華南走私及港地外滙黑市諸懸案，即可迎刃而解云。</p>
<h3>對進口貨處置辦法　進出口商發表意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自輸出入管理委員會對於未經領得許可證之已到　或已啓運之輸入貨品處置辦法公佈後，本市進出口商業同業公會負責人張耀章等頃發表意見如下：關於未經領得輸入許可證已到埠及已啓運之貨品，輸出入管理委員會頃已公告處理辦法兩項，凡在卅六年八月十六日以前啟運者，統可向該會辦理登記手續，靜候處理，此舉甚屬賢明，予商人之痛苦謀一解決途徑，但登記後之處置辦法，則尚需另行公佈。否人以爲此項登記後之物品，應予商人結關提取之便利。蓋此類已到已啓運之物品，大部均在上年十一月十七日以前所訂購，是時本國尚無輸入許可證之手續，故貨款幾已全部付淸，而國外出口商或廠商更不能忽因我國頒佈此項輸入許可手續而廢業交貨契約，自必照約交貨啓運也。又此項登記貨品處置以後，其在本年八另十七日以後未經領得輸入許可證以前，自不能再行治購或啓運。如有此類情事發生，吾人自當擁護公告辦法，從嚴辦理，蓋時至今日，官價外滙無市價外滙供應辦法，業已規定明白矣云。</p>

<h3>新買踟躕不前　華股市氣荏弱</h3>
<p>華股昨僅上塲時稍現秀色，多方乘萬紛紛了結，突現鬆濫，下月起財產稅實行開征，以及工廠貸款全數收還等說紛傳，美匯市價之掛牌，復有减低之謂，新買不繼，買方急於了結，除華豐搪瓷尚站堅定這局外，熱股紛紛跌至低價，中絲且迫跌停，美亞亦被帶低。</p>
<p>晨開尚穩，遞永紗開後，自二三八元起，由二一八號三二號二二三號二三二號一八六號九七號一〇四號二二四號賣出，二〇七號五〇號二二三號二八號九七號二二六號賣出現永紗，步降至二二六元。九七號八五號趁低維持，稍有回升。嗣後不利消息盛傳，一二五號二二六號三六號一五八號紛售現永紗，六八號一五七號則售出現永紗，而將遞永紗迫低至二二三元。</p>
<p>十時半，塲外息價仍開一角二及一角六分半原價，一一六號買進較多，又有微升。三六號四號一六號一五四號一一二號再售，三六號二二四號一八五號一二九號一五四號九四號八號復供給現永紗，近午步降至二一五元及二二一元低價。一六三號維持之下，八四號亦進即交永紗，午收以二一八元及二二三元之價結束。收後喊價稍低，雜股中中絲且曾迫跌停，僅華豐搪瓷有二二〇號興業銀行奮購遞交。一〇一號則吃進即交，曾現現遞倒掛之象，獨見俏利。</p>
<p>結果與前收計即交股華豐獨漲半成，永紗跌半成，新光景福勤興又跌半成，景綸跌一成半，中絲跌後有回，軋小一成，美亞亦降一成，麗安微升，餘股均告小挫。遞交股計華豐漲半成，美亞跌半成，永紗新光景福微挫，永公微升，塲外各老股除大生三廠及五洲見漲外，餘均平疲而已。</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，昨十分平定，交易亦見淸淡。永紗之貼價晨開五元，自五元八跌至四元半，而以四元八收市。美亞自十一元退至八元牟，而以九元半結束。新光在三元四元間，合息價約六分至一角。</p>
<p>一一五號遭受申斥</p>
<p>第一一五號經紀人羅殿臣，擅設分辦事處，監理官辦公室業已接到指令，該分辦事處勒令停業外，仍應予以申斥，如再故違，定予嚴懲不貸，證交業已於市塲公告。</p>
<p>統債外股挫跌</p>
<p>公債昨以美金庫劵財部有發還之訊，統債之迷夢，更爲遙遠而告回跌。統丙晨開一二五〇〇元。即告步降至一一五〇〇元，最後在一二〇〇〇元外掙扎，五五五室五〇三室五三八室均售，三六〇室及潤德則納，成交約六七百萬。結果較前收計甲乙丙各跌七百元，丁戊亦跌一千元。</p>
<p>外股昨見疲軟，證劵帮洋行帮有供，廣帮則進，美匯市價掛牌見低，怡紗自八萬五起，退至八萬三結束。結果較前收計紙業航業各跌半成，餘股各跌少許。</p>
<h3>收購無許可證外棉昨舉行第三次審查</h3>

<p>結果選出壽景偉，唐季珊，葉世昌·洪經五·在振寰·韓鈞衡·宋啓箎·陶振聲·寗蔚廷·朱衍慶·吳覺農·孫曉村·陳仲明·王向辰·十四人爲代表，定廿四日夜車赴京，分向主管機關陳明一切，並請酌予調整收購價格，以資彌補云。</p>
<p>又據該公會負責人告稱：此次政府當局以極大決心實施外滙管理新辦法，實爲適應現實，及挽救我國輸出貿易危機之有效方案，故中外茶商均表示一致擁護，此後自當積極推進，達成任務，決不使外銷箱茶價格暴升。關於去年及今年度箱茶推銷如何穩定價格之問題，並已壘經商討，不久即將以具體方案，建議政府云</p>
<h3>人造絲挫落</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因配售即須出貨，開盤頓告挫跌，一二〇號高山有光先喊二千五百二十萬元，中午收盤價爲五百萬元，期貨喊四百萬元，七天交貨。下午最後爲五百三十萬元賣出價，比上日跌落一百十萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市續疲，做開C字等級價三千萬元，C字優等貨亦有成交，價做三千〇七十萬元。E字等級有五包交易，做價二千九百萬元，貨款均有七天期頭。二十八分干經有單子五担頭，討價一千九百五十萬元，印度洋行略有納胃，不過還價八百萬元未成交。開口貨三十分另担，昨價稍短。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨眞絲被面比上日跌去十萬元，華强貨開市後在一千一百十三四五萬元之間盤旋甚久，最大會喊十八萬元，直至將近收市前，因散多出籠，於是告挫，傾刻間跌進十萬元關內，最後竟小至一百〇二萬元即期價，隔日期〇五萬元。大誠貨最短比華强貨只大二三萬元，收市隔日期做十萬元，格子　編三萬七千元原價未動。</p>
<h3>美匯基凖價　昨減低五百元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自外滙平衡基金委員會於十八日核定即期美滙結滙行市芬準價爲三萬九千元後，數日來各指定銀行遵照該項基準價買賣外滙結果，大部均係出口結滙，進口結滙較少，故各行幾均形成供過於求之勢，是改訂結滙辦法，已收初步效果。故昨日平衡委會當察酌市况實情，將天滙結滙基準價，核减爲三萬八千五百元，較前抑低五百元。照此比例推算，昨日指定銀行對即期美滙之買賣行市，亦告减低，計買進爲三萬八千元，賣出爲三萬九千元。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價　暫不變更</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會，昨日會議結果，對各支紗議價，決定仍維持原價，不予調整云。、</p>

<p>棉布</p>
<p>昨初開挺秀，迨近午收，大戶拋售，布勢頓告疲軟，最後龍頭細布價爲四十五萬元，比上日軋升二千元，藍鷄彩球亦好五千，五福陽鶴振中及二十支特細布，則續挫一二千至五千元，其餘漂布粗細布元布及藍布士林布等，至有升降。</p>
<h3>上海信託公司匯兌業務發達</h3>

<h3>可怕的子宮癌症</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>癌腫是一種惡性腫疣，在目下還沒有根治的療法；所以歐美婦女，一聽到醫師癌腫的判斷，好似宣告了她的死刑一樣，因之對於癌腫，就有一種警戒心。吾國民衆，對於癌腫，還沒有多大的認識，有的簡直連癌腫的名稱，也不明瞭，錯過治療的時期，是多麼可惜可憐的事情！鄙人在上月遇到了道樣的一段事實，就是去年有一個中年婦人，帶了她的小孩子來看病，她乘便談起她的母親，今年已經五十餘歲，近來身體不好，月經還沒有斷，是否因爲月經多來的關係，引起她的身體不好？她這樣的來問我；我當時就問她「白帶多不多」，她回復道；十女九帶，白帶總是有的。吾就告訴她，一個女子，在五十多歲以後，經期應當停止，如果再有白帶的話，就應當請醫師檢查一次，是否癌腫，癌腫是一種可怕的疾病，應當早期發現，早期治療才好，否則要後悔莫及呢！她姑妄聰之而去。到了今年，她自己來就診，談及她的母親，悔不聽吾勸告，目下已送入醫院，醫師告以子宮癌腫的病症，而且病勢已深，手術無望，只好用用雷錠。吾聽了以後，覺到醫學常識的需要普及，還是刻不容緩的事情。</p>
<p>（一）癌肺爲什麼可怕？上面已經講過，癌腫是一種惡性腫疣，究意惡性腫疣同良性腫疣有甚麼不同的地方呢！吾把她分述在下面。</p>
<p>A·良性腫疣，他外面有一種被膜包圍着，這個腫疣就是增大的話，也和別的組織有分明的境界，不去侵犯人家。惡性腫疣呢！他有一種破壞性增殖的能力，他的外圍沒有境界，儘量的向周圍發展，施行破壞的手段，不但柔軟的組織，被他破壞，就是堅硬的骨質也要受到他的侵蝕呢</p>
<p>B·良性腫疣，發生在某一個器官上，就此停止，不會從甲氣管蔓延到乙氣管。惡性腫疣呢！他的細胞能够從血液或淋巴液，由甲器官轉移到隣近的乙氣管，甚至遠隔的丙氣管，也可發生同樣的惡性腫疣。</p>
<p>C·良性腫疣用手術除去以後，就此完結，惡性腫疣呢！往往施行不至的手術以後，如果在隣近健康組織中，還有腫疣胚芽潛伏的話，隔了些時日，仍然可以再發。</p>
<p>D·良性腫疣對於整個人體，是沒有妨礙的，惡性腫疣呢！能够使病人形容憔悴，骨瘦如柴，痛苦不堪，奄奄一息的樣子，這在醫學上呌做「惡液質」。</p>
<p>（二）子宮癌的症候；子宮癌大多發生於四十到五十歲以上的婦人，尤以多次分娩的婦人爲多，本病的症候，第一：就是月經分量過多或是不定期的子宮出血（有一定週期的呌做月經，如果是十天廿天來一次的，並不是月經，是子宮出血。）大多數的婦人，以爲經期將斷時候的擾亂，不去注意。第二：是白帶，在初起的時候，白帶分量不很多，稍帶臭氣；迨後白帶淋漓，惡臭難堪，但是初期因爲「十女九帶」的口號掩護下，也不去注意牠。第三：是疼痛，癌腫初期，僅僅侵犯子宮本身，大多不覺到甚麼疼痛，侵犯到鄰近的臟器，譬如腹膜，膀胱，直腸，子宮周圍結締織的時候，病人就覺到疼痛，覺到疼痛，病勢已表示進行擴展。第四：在癌種初期，因癌腫毒素的關係，　慾减退，到了末期，全身狀態，更爲惡化，骨瘦如柴，形容憔悴，發生癌腫特有的惡液質，如果有混合傳染的話，還要發生寒熱，病人死刑的執行，就在目前了。</p>
<p>（三）子宮癌絕對沒有希望嗎？那不是一定，你能够在初期的時候，就是四五十歲的婦人，有月經過多，白帶淋漓，或是局部有異常的時候，就去請醫生檢查，檢查的結果，有癌腫的可疑，再用組織檢查，割取可疑的一部份組織，　　　微鏡的檢查，如果確定癌腫的話，就用手術把子宮完全拿出，再施行X光和雷鏡的照射　以防其復發，所以癌腫並不是浼有希望的。如果錯過手術的時期，就是癌腫已向周圍蔓延，日夜疼痛，形容憔悴的話，即使病人要求手術，醫師也只好袖手旁觀，愛莫能助。癌腫病人的早期診斷，是癌腫病人的莫大福音，但是國人因爲醫學常識的不普及，和婦人的羞恥觀念，使大好的手術時期，遷延錯過。眞是何等的可憐呀！</p>
<h3>范氏醫論集序</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>放眼一看，目前的中國情勢，社會環境，是如何的情况，就可以瞭然了：二十年前的情况，與二十年之後的目前情况，很少有改進的模樣。二十年前的「中醫問題」，到了二十年後的今日，還是一樣的沒有一個適當的具體解決；雖有一部分中醫界的前進分子和社會的進步人士，深感中醫不能獨立以爭存，大有接近科學，硏究新醫的傾向和風尚；但其中的守舊分子，倒底佔多數，他們仍在積極地大開其倒車，向着時代的逆流奔走；仍然抱着險陽五行不肯放手，以陰陽五行爲中醫的「科學」。一般的人士，對於醫學問題，仍然是十分的漠視，對於近代醫藥，仍很少有正確的認識和理解。大多數的民衆，對於醫學衛生的常識，仍然是異常隔膜，異常缺乏，對於自身的健康間題的不加重視，也是依然如故。傳染病的流行，每年四季，不論都市鄉村，照舊在不斷的流行，沒有達到遏止的標的。總之，一切的一切，二十年的歲月，好像是白白的過去，看不見一點顯著的進步的跡象。這一面現實社會的鏡子，放在眼前，不是看得淸淸楚楚的嗎？</p>
<p>不進步的原因，是很多的：政治的不能統一，連年連月的內戰，致使無法建國，無法安定民生，從事生產，這便是阻礙一切社會文化的進步的大原因。也就是阻礙醫學文化的進步的大原因。醫學文化，原是社會文化的一部分。他的發展進步，必須有其物質的條件——經濟基礎。二十年來，國家因長期內戰，及八年來的抗日戰爭，財政的困難——經濟基礎的薄弱，是不消說的了。當局對於醫事建設衡生設施，更抱掛名主義，敷衍了事；對於醫學政策，則旣欲順應潮流，信奉科學，而又徘徊於玄學，不肯放手，大開其倒車。意見分歧不一，態度模稜兩可。致使朝野人士，莫知適從，貽笑萬方，邦國之恥，識者惜之，識者痛之！抗戰八年，結果勝利了。人民大衆的願望，滿望中國的國運，雖不能從此一步登天，亦總可望其由此良機，進入和平統一，協力建國，逐漸完成一現代化的民主國家；而內戰分裂等恥名，定可永不再見諸於白紙黑字了。可是事與願違，內戰的烽火，隨政見的分歧，談商的失敗，而重見於國土；勝利之後的二年中，大有愈演愈烈的情勢，而無絲毫停息的跡象。這樣，政治不能和平統一，民生不能安定，又何從而致力建設，努力生產？因此，一切的社會文化，建設事業，都在停滯麻痺的階段中，醫學的文化事業，不消說，同樣地無法推進，無法展開。這，都是致使中國醫學文化，數十年如一日的少有進步的實際原因。</p>
<p>就因爲在這樣一個經過了數十年的悠長歲月，而仍不見進步的中國社會，我這些歷年所寫作的文字，還有刋行出版的價値，這些陳言陳跡的老唱片，還有重行傳播，反復開唱的必要。我寫作這些次章時的對象，是當時幼稚的社會，我現在把這些文字收集起來，刋行問世，其對象，也還是眼前的幼稚的社會。社會局其一年一月一日的不見其進步，我的這些文字，好像還不會死去，也還仍然是一些活着的文字。所以，我刋行這一部書，我的內心，實實在在、有些一啼笑皆非之慨哩！</p>
<p>要到什麼時候，才需要不到我這些幼稚的言論和淺薄的文字呢？這，就要看我們中國社會的進步的速度了。</p>
<p>如其中國社會到了某一新的進步的階段，即社會的人士，一般的民衆，對於我這集子裏的言論文字，都已感覺到幼稚和淺薄的時候，那也就是我近二十年來，寫作這些文字的最大目的和最高願望了。我希望着我這最大的目的和最高的願望，能够早日達到！因爲，這一願望，這一目的，也就是中國全體人民的共同目的，全體人民的共同願望呀！</p>
<p>俊青按：范守淵醫師爲本屆之上海市參議員歷年以來對於醫事方面之社會運動非常努力，早已蜚聲海上。目下又爲醫師公會內各位理事推舉爲醫師方面之國大代表競選人，將來發揚光大定必爲吾醫界放一異彩。本文所述之「范氏醫論集」爲其近廿年來之述作，即即其努力於「醫事方面之社會運動」之結晶。方今國家建設伊始，需才孔亟，吾人於欽佩范君之餘因即樂爲介紹如上。（續完）</p>
<h3>診餘漫談（續）</h3>
<p>— 吳濟華</p>
<p>安樂根在男性刺激素中並不是最進步的製劑，牠的地位介乎睪丸浸膏與純凈睪丸刺激素之間，簡單些說是一種嘗經生物學試騐測定其力價的睪丸製劑。較之粗製睪丸浸膏與司保命之類，固然優勝一籌，但是與近世最進步的純淨睪丸刺激素相比，則相差尚遠祗好算是落伍的製品。安樂根雖經鷄冠試騐測定其每公撮含有兩個鷄冠單位的力價，但其溶液中尚含有不少雜質，所以貯藏過久每有紅黃色的粒狀沉澱物柝出而逐漸减少其治療價値。目前黑市中所購得的安樂根大多有十年光景的年紀，這種陳腐老貨的效力較之新鮮出品早巳打了很大的折扣而售價乃招得如此之高，眞是出最高代價而買得二等宿貨，豈不寃哉枉也。假定喜歡用天然睪汍激素的話，不妨改用美國廠家所製的各種出品，例如Virosterone“Endo”每安　一公撮含有三個或五個鷄冠單位，祗售三四萬元錢，豈不經濟得多，而且據筆者試用功效也與安樂根不相上下。又或改用瑞士貨安達祿壽Androstin也可以得到近似的功效。</p>
<p>保妥酊Padutin乃胰臟中抽出的一種循環刺激素，功能抑制血管痙　，擴大身體表面的血管和心臟內冠狀動脈。牠的適應症是血管痙　末端靑紫麻木，問歇性跛行，雷瑙氏壞疽，阻塞性動脈內膜炎，榮養性潰瘍，胃潰瘍與十二指腸潰瘍，眞性高血壓症與狹心症等。普通多用於高血壓症，利用牠擴大表面血管的作用，使血壓降低。保妥酊因係刺激素，所以與一般刺激素相同，其功效甚易消逝而必須持續應用；據規定劑量起初每日注射一一次每次半安瓿，三日以後每日注射二次每次一安瓿，待功效减弱時尚須增高劑量至每日注射二次每次二安瓿或更高的劑量。以目前每安瓿五十五萬元的價格計算，病人在十日內約須化費藥價一千二百六十五萬元，豈不駭人聽聞。而化了如此奇昻的代價，試問確能治愈高血壓症馬？這是不能，決不能的。因爲眞性高血壓症的病原很複雜，迄今還沒有硏究得一致的結論，所以治療的方法雖多，而效果皆未能滿意。弛張血管與解除血管痙　的製劑，如保妥酊之類，不過是暫時降低血壓的一種藥物罷了。假定病人不知攝生或注射次數太少，血壓即緩緩上升而有復歸原位的可能。據筆者經騐，治療高血壓症以休養身心爲最有效騐，如能摒棄勞神勞力的職務而居家靜養不問世事，每日下午小臥二三小時，輔以調節飲食，戒除烟酒應用碘劑（碘化鉀爲最經濟）和鎭靜劑等，則血壓自然逐步低降而不易回升。萬一必需弛張血管的藥物，似宜採取功效相仿而遠絞低廉的Acetylcholine（羅氏出品每盒六安瓿僅十七八萬元）等劑。你若崇拜偶像踏破鐵鞋去求保妥酊，眞是上海人所謂天字第一號的大瘟生了。</p>
<p>度冷丁Dolantin是止痛解痙的藥，普通用爲嗎啡的代替品以避免嗎啡的副作用。止痛藥除嗎啡外尚有很多種類，何必一定用度冷丁。倘用爲解痙劑，則可以取德貨Octinum代替功效亦大同小異而價値便宜得多（瑞士產Octinum價格更廉）或改用原料Extract　Belladonna　Atropin尤爲經濟。總之，度冷丁是可以他藥代替而得到同樣效果的，何必搜求這貴貨呢。日前有一個姓周的女病人到我診所裏來我代她買一管度冷丁藥片，據說吃了可以興奮精神，引起快感，抑止頭昏頭重。我回答她說，這藥不應該値幾十萬元錢，我不願替你購買，順手就給她幾小片Phenobar-bital　1/2gr，敎她試試看。三日後她來說功效很好，還要購備少許，總算度冷丁的生意被我敲破了。</p>

<h3>小農村</h3>
<p>— Ｅ·左拉著　畢修勺譯</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>小農村在那裏？牠把牠的許多白屋藏在什麼崎　的地摺裏？這些白屋集合在凹地深處的敎堂周圍麽？或沿看大路一列地排着，　出愉悅的外貌呢？不然，牠們或者如頑皮的山羊一樣，爬上一個崗陵，把紅的一層一層或牛掩地陸在綠　的底下？</p>
<p>小農村，牠有悅耳的名稱麽？惟有一個易於法國人嘴層發音的溫柔名稱麽？不然他或者由許多德文子音拚成讀來非常生硬，　得簡直如烏鴉的叫聲一樣吧？</p>
<p>在這小農村中，人們是收穫小麥，還是採取葡萄呢？牠是小麥的產地呢？還是葡萄的區域？這時候，居民們在晒着太陽的土地上，究竟在做些什麼呢？晚上，沿着田間的小徑回來，他們也停住看看廣大的收穫物，因而感謝老天賜這幸福的一年麽？</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我高興想像牠在一個低矮的小崗上。牠立在那裏，如此隱蔽地藏於濃密的樹林之下，從遠處看來，牠簡直是一片傾坍的岩石，上面蓋着碧綠的苔蘚。但是炊烟從枝葉間冒出；循着斜坡下來的小徑上，許多孩子在推着小車。於是，從平原上，大家就以嫉妬的羡慕注視牠；人們過去，腦中就存着這半現窠巢的紀念。</p>
<p>不，我寗願相信牠在平原的一角，傍着一條美麗的小河。牠的範圍那樣小，一排帳幕似的白楊樹就可以給牠遮住一切人的眼睛。牠的茅舍，如貞潔的女浴者似的，消失在河邊的柳林中。一端碧綠的牧塲給牠作爲氈毯；一個荆棘離笆到處圍繞牠，使牠成為大的花園。人們在牠旁邊經過，可是看不見牠。洗衣婦的聲音響着，簡直如白頰鳥的鳴聲。沒有一縷炊烟。牠平靜地睡在牠綠　床第的深處。</p>
<p>我們中沒有一個人認識牠。隣近的城市也剛知道牠的存在，牠那樣微小，竟沒有一個地理學家注意牠。牠簡直空無一人。牠的名稱引不起半點回憶。在許多名稱魯亮的城市中，牠是一個無歷史，無光榮，無恥辱，謙抑地消失於一角的荒村。</p>
<p>就是因爲這樣，牠纔如此溫柔地微笑着，這可愛的小農村！牠的居民生活在僻靜的荒野中；許多兒童在河岸打滾，女子們則在樹蔭之下往來。牠呢，牠很幸福，牠過着隱蔽的生活，充滿天堂似的歡樂。牠離大城市的濘泥與暄噪那麽遠！牠的陽光就够牠享受了；牠的快樂就由牠的寂靜，牠的　抑，以及給牠遮住整個世界的這帳幕似的白楊樹造成。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>明天，全世界或者會知道這農村的存在。</p>
<p>啊！天外飛來的大禍—小河將被血流染紅了，帳幕似的白楊樹，將被砲彈炸平，被破毁的茅舍將指出各家的無聲失望，小農祠由此出名了。</p>
<p>再沒有洗衣婦的歌聲，再沒有孩子們在河邊打滾，再沒有收獲物，再沒有寂靜與幸福的謙抑。勝利或失敗，歷史上多一新的地名，多一血的新頁，多一悲壯的，由我們青年這血灌溉的新角落。</p>
<p>牠笑，牠睡，牠不知道會把自己的名字借給一個大屠殺，明天，牠將鳴咽，牠以臨終的喘息，響澈歐洲。然後，牠將如一點血斑似的留在地上。他，昨天還如此快活，如此溫柔，今日却圍上凄慘的陰暗，牠將看見臉色灰白的訪問者，在牠面前經過，如人們經過騐屍所的地板之前一樣。牠此後將被詛咒了。</p>
<p>我們，如果牠是奧斯丹里茨（Austerlitz）或馬襄達（Margenta）（一），我們將聽見牠以勝利的號聲響於我們的心中。如果他是滑鐵盧（Waterloo），我們的回憶中則有悲慘的迴聲，好像崇着黑紗的鼓聲，領着全國人的喪禮。</p>
<p>牠一定懷念牠的寂　的河岸，牠的無知的農民，牠的偏僻的角落，——離開人類那麽遠，只有每年春天回來的燕子，纔認識牠的存在！已被汚辱了，牠將羞恥地以牠充滿烏鴉飛翔的天，發着死屍臭味的地，如殺人越貨的危險地方一樣，永遠活在未來的世紀中，永遠留爲兩民族互相殘殺的可怕的古戰塲。</p>
<p>愛的巢穴，平和的安樂鄕，這小農村此後便成爲廣大的墳塲，公衆的掩埋所，連悲泣的母親們也不能到這裏來安放她們的花園。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>法國在世界各處散佈這些遙遠的墳塲。在歐洲的任何角落，我們都能跪下去祈蘇。我們安息的公墓不只是柏爾·賴雪士，蒙瑪特爾或蒙巴挪斯；牠們還有我們一切勝利與失敗之地的名稱。在天底下，從中國，到墨西哥，從俄羅斯的雪地，到埃及的黄沙，沒有一角土地，不睡着一個被一殺的法國人。</p>
<p>許多寂靜而荒凉的墳塲，沉重地睡在廣大鄕野的平和中。大多數，差不多全體，都聞在被毁壞村落的脚下，牠的傾坍墻垣還充滿可佈的景象。清鐵盧只是一個農莊，馬襄達僅有五十上下的房屋。一陣可佈的歪風吹在這些極小的村落上，牠們的字音，前一天還是無罪的，從此染上這樣大的血味與火藥的氣息，以致人類一嗅到牠的時候，就永遠會戰憟起來。</p>
<p>沉思地，我注視一張戰區的地圖。循着萊茵河兩岸，我詢問平原與山嶽。小農村在河的左面，還是在河的右面呢？應該在衝要地位的附近找牠呢？還是更遠一些，在廣大荒原的某處，發現牠的所在地？</p>
<p>於是，我閉着眼睛，沒法想像這平和的村落，這帳幕似的白楊樹垂在整堆白屋的前面這碧綠的，許多燕子在那邊接過的草塲的一端，這洗衣婦的歌聲，這將被戰爭强姦，將被軍隊喇叭聲一吹汚其地平綫的處女地。</p>
<p>這小農村，牠究境在哪裏呢？（二）</p>

<p>一</p>
<p>黄昏，第一顆大星在天邊出現了，我將窗紗輕輕的掩上，呌她們訴說自己的　　。</p>
<p>一個道：『我沒有願望』。</p>
<p>又一個却說：「我有太多的願望，說不　說』。</p>
<p>另一個說：『我只有一個願望，上帝原恕我，並沒有寬大的同情心，和博愛的精神，我只忠實的禱吿，但願一切我所　愛的人，我所憎恕的人，全都健康，平安，好好的活下去，別呌他們死亡；因爲如果來日方長，我還要深切的愛，痛切的恨，至於某他的人，我可管不着了。』</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the National Economic Council: Suspension of US Dollar Bond Sales; Treatment of State-Operated Enterprise Personnel According to Previous Regulations; No Procurement of Goods Other Than Silk Cocoons, Antimony, and Tungsten</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] The 12th routine meeting of the National Economic Council was held at the Executive Yuan from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 21st. The attendees included members Zhang Jia'ao, Lou Tongsun, Liu Hangchen, Sun Longji, Wang Xiaolai, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and more than thirty others, chaired by Zhang Qun. At the beginning of the meeting, Zhang first reported on the revisions to the regulations on foreign exchange and import-export trade controls, addressing the issues of gold note trading, whether to suspend the sale of US dollar bonds, and whether to continue procuring export goods. He also invited the attending members to express their opinions. After a heated discussion among the members, it was decided that the procurement of all export goods except silk cocoons, antimony, and tungsten would be suspended. As for the US dollar bonds, it was decided to suspend their sale. The Ministry of Finance was tasked with formulating detailed plans on how to handle the portions that had already been sold. The council also passed the following routine matters: (1) Regarding the regulations on the treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises, it was decided that, with the exception of the China Textile Industries Corporation and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, whose personnel treatment would be handled on a case-by-case basis, the treatment of personnel in other state-operated enterprises, such as national banks, would be handled according to the regulations passed by the former Supreme National Defense Council. This meant that the salaries and allowances of employees in state-operated enterprises should not exceed those of ordinary civil servants by more than 30%. If the enterprise had a surplus, dividends could be distributed once every three months. (2) Regarding the reorganization of provincial enterprises, it was resolved to appoint five members—Wang Yunwu, Weng Wenhao, Zuo Shunsheng, Pan Xulun, and Xiao Zheng—to review the matter, with Wang Yunwu as the convener. (3) Regarding cases of real estate among enemy and puppet properties being occupied, the Central Trust Bureau submitted a detailed report and proposed several opinions. After deliberation by the members, it was decided to have the Transportation Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee study the matter and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) Regarding the proposal by members Liu Hangchen, Wang Xiaolai, and Sun Longji to exchange domestically produced silk with Japanese rayon, it was resolved to have the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Central Bank study the matter before making a decision.</p>
<p>Attached: Regulations on the Treatment of Personnel in State-Operated Enterprises: (1) The treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises may be determined by the enterprises themselves according to their customary practices, but the total amount of their income shall not be less than 20% or more than 30% of the income of public school teachers and civil servants of equivalent rank. (2) The aforementioned compensation refers to salaries, public expenses, and all allowances. In addition, there shall be no disguised forms of compensation. The superior supervising authority shall conduct strict assessments on a regular basis. (3) If the enterprise has a surplus at the end of the year, bonuses may be issued with the approval of the supervising authority, but the maximum amount shall not exceed three months' income. (4) In the future, unless the compensation of public school teachers and civil servants is adjusted, the treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises may also be adjusted at any time. However, if state-operated enterprises wish to adjust the compensation of their personnel, they must have the proposal strictly reviewed by the superior supervising authority and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be implemented. (5) All personnel in state-operated enterprises are civil servants and shall be subject to all laws and regulations pertaining to the service of civil servants. (6) If the compensation of foreign personnel and special technical personnel employed by state-operated enterprises cannot be handled in accordance with these regulations, the matter shall be reported to the competent superior authority and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (7) After these regulations are implemented, all existing compensation for personnel in state-operated enterprises that conflicts with these regulations shall be immediately abolished.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao and Others Fly to Nanjing to Discuss Supplementary Matters After Exchange Rate Adjustment; Tightening Loans is Appropriate for Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, and Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor, flew to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st to discuss with Finance Minister Yu Hongjun other supplementary matters concerning the promulgation of the new foreign exchange control measures. The handling of the 36th year US dollar bonds is also one of the issues.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, returned to Nanjing by plane on the morning of the 21st after going to Shanghai to oversee the implementation of the changes in the management of foreign exchange and import-export trade. It is reported that the lending policy of national banks and treasuries will be closely coordinated with national policy to assist in the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement measures. Various head offices of banks and treasuries have telegraphed their branches nationwide to temporarily tighten loan operations. Various branches in the capital city have received orders to suspend lending for one week. However, according to observations in financial circles, with the settlement measures being revised and import-export trade being active, and with the autumn harvest approaching and agricultural products entering the market in abundance, the sudden suspension of lending by national banks and treasuries will naturally lead to tightening by commercial banks and financial institutions. It is expected that credit will tighten in the short term. Although this temporary measure will affect those with cash flow shortages, it is very appropriate for the overall market and stabilizing prices. The loan review committee of the Joint Treasury will be even stricter in reviewing loan applications in the future.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Joint Dispatch from Anhui Credit Agency: There is widespread concern about whether export commodities will rise due to the promulgation of the new foreign exchange and import-export management measures, thereby offsetting the benefits of the exchange rate adjustment. This morning, the reporter specifically inquired about this issue with Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, who replied: Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange and import-export management measures, the market reaction has been quite good. The government is closely considering and paying attention to various export commodities and general prices and has drafted overall comprehensive measures, so there will be no other factors affecting the benefits of the adjustment.</p>
<h3>United States Lodges Second Protest Against Continued Soviet Occupation of Dalian; Soviet Union Should Bear Full Responsibility for Losses Incurred</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 3:00 AM on the 22nd Broadcast: The US State Department announced: The US government has lodged a second extremely stern protest against the Soviet Union's continued delay in reopening the port of Dalian. This protest was delivered to Moscow on the 14th of this month. The first US protest on this matter was filed on January 3rd. In the first protest, the US argued that the Soviet Union had no reason to further delay opening the port of Dalian as a free international trade port, as this was clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 1945.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The US government lodged a protest against the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Dalian. The protest statement declared that the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility for the losses incurred by the US in Dalian.</p>
<h3>Direct Communication Between Xuzhou and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xuzhou, 21st] Telegraphs between Xuzhou and Shanghai, which previously had to be relayed through Nanjing, will be directly communicated starting on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Military Education; Implementing Circuit Lectures</h3>
<p>Scholars Hired by the Ministry of National Defense to Serve as Lecturers</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] According to the Military News Agency: In order to strengthen military education and enhance the political knowledge of officers, soldiers, and students, as well as increase their interest in academic research, the Ministry of National Defense has invited famous professors and experts to conduct circuit lectures in the 36th year. The targets are officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Headquarters, students of various military schools, soldiers of the Youth Army divisions, and young people receiving training in the Youth Training Corps. They are temporarily divided into two groups: the first group is the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou group, which is staffed by four lecturers, one of whom also serves as a兼任(concurrent post), and the second group is the Xuzhou-Luoyang-Xi'an group, which is staffed by three lecturers. The lecture period is set for one and a half months, starting in mid-August and expected to conclude at the end of September. It is learned that lecturers Ren Zhuoxuan, Zhang Jiuru, Chen Zhonghao, and Xu Hong have already departed.</p>
<h3>Canadian Delegation Meets with Chairman; Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Reception to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Mr. Creer, the head of the Canadian delegation to Japan (pictured), accompanied by Mr. Ling Qihan, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Canadian Ambassador Mr. and Mrs. Davis, went to the official residence to meet with Chairman Chiang at 5:00 PM on the 21st. Mr. Creer was very busy with social engagements throughout the day. In the morning, he visited Minister Wang Shijie, Minister Bai Chongxi, and President Zhang Qun. At noon, the Ambassador and his wife hosted a banquet for the delegation, to which President Zhang, Bai Chongxi, Yu Dawei, Shen Yi, Liu Shishun, Ye Gongchao, and others were invited. In the afternoon, Mr. Creer continued to visit Minister Yu Dawei. From 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM in the evening, Minister Wang hosted a cocktail reception at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. More than thirty government leaders, including President Zhang, Vice President Wang Yunwu, Secretary-General Gan Naiguang, Director Zheng Jiemin, Military Attaché Tang Junpiao, as well as British, Canadian, Indian, and Australian ambassadors and military officers, attended and enjoyed the gathering.</p>
<h3>Varying Comments and Observations from the United States and Britain on China's Implementation of New Foreign Exchange Policy; Washington Officials Skeptical; British Newspaper Believes it Can Control Speculation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] US officials expressed doubt on the 20th as to whether China's new foreign exchange policy would materially help stimulate increased trade between China and the United States. Their opinion is that this new policy may temporarily stimulate China's export trade, but this effect will be weakened in a very short period by China's general economic turmoil. They say that as a result of the new policy, the prices of some Chinese commodities have already risen. This policy clearly cannot stop inflation and may in fact stimulate it. A well-informed official believes that exports such as bristles, wool for rugs, and other luxury goods such as pre-war embroidered products may suddenly increase, but this is an insignificant part of China's trade. He pointed out that tung oil, one of China's important exports, which is controlled and exported by the government, does not receive the benefit of 40,000 Legal Tender for every US dollar under the new foreign exchange policy, but maintains the exchange rate of 12,000 to 1. Chinese raw silk may still encounter rejection in the US market because raw silk has long been subject to competition from Japanese raw silk in the US. The US government's attempt to sell raw silk in the US has not achieved any significant success.</p>
<p>Some officials stated that measures of this kind would be ineffective unless the main causes of China's economic disorder and inflation were removed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The Washington office of the Wall Street Journal predicted today that China's new foreign exchange policy would not be of much benefit to Sino-US commerce. Although the Chinese government hopes to increase exports and reduce imports in order to establish a dollar supply and make the trade balance more favorable, this may not succeed. The outlook for China's major exports (including tung oil and egg silk) is very bleak. At the same time, high US import taxes are currently hindering the import of Chinese eggs and walnuts into the United States. The war and transportation inconveniences have also prevented the export of bristles, wool, sheepskin, and camel hair, but there is a glimmer of hope among them, which is the export of Chinese luxury goods. Now that China can obtain more Legal Tender for each US dollar, it is hoped that Chinese exporters can supply new luxury consumers with these luxury goods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The economic editor of The Times of London commented today on the decision of our country's new foreign exchange measures, believing that this move is a good trend and may stimulate exports as a result. He said that setting daily exchange rates contains a certain degree of flexibility, because the exchange rate can move up or down without rising all the time. This move can also control speculation. He stated that the Chinese government can regain control of the foreign exchange market for a while, but any permanent balance of Chinese foreign exchange cannot be achieved unless two obstacles are removed. One is the continuous deficit in national finances, which eventually leads to massive inflation; the other is the obstruction of transportation, which prevents goods from the interior from flowing smoothly to the ports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] The Hong Kong Telegraph commented on the new foreign exchange policy promulgated by our government, saying that this move has several effects in saving the devaluation of Legal Tender: (1) Foreign buyers can return to the Chinese market because their gold yuan can obtain a considerable quantity of goods, whereas previously, according to the official exchange rate, they could only buy a quarter of this amount. (2) Import and export merchants can obtain more freedom, especially foreign merchants who previously had to trade at official prices. (3) Increase in remittances from overseas Chinese, which is the most influential thing for Chinese export trade. In short, the Chinese government is determined to save the foreign exchange crisis and has a hope of success.</p>
<h3>Good Reactions from Various Places; Price Stabilization Trend in Peiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 21st] Today is the fifth day of the government's revision of the foreign exchange management measures. The stability of prices in Peiping is unprecedented in previous exchange rate adjustments. Although market conditions have changed slightly in recent days, today they have all returned to their original prices. American yarn has also weakened to 42,000. Because speculators generally cannot estimate the extent to which the government has relaxed import restrictions, most of them are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and some are selling off one after another for fear of losing money.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] Today, foreign currency market prices here are extremely stable. The Hong Kong dollar has been between 7200 and 7300 all day, and one US dollar is still exchanging for 5.1 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 21st] Commodity prices in Qingdao on the 21st were stable, and the market price of the US dollar was 42,500 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] On the 21st, the Bank of China in Tianjin quoted a buying price of 39,800 yuan and a selling price of 41,200 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Today, the Bank of Taiwan quoted a buying price of 557.7 New Taiwan dollars and a selling price of 638.4 New Taiwan dollars for the US dollar. The market price was a buying price of 720 New Taiwan dollars and a selling price of 730 New Taiwan dollars, but there were no major transactions. The financial market did not see any fluctuations. Export goods, however, saw price increases. First-grade sugar was 1636 New Taiwan dollars per catty, black tea was 22,000 New Taiwan dollars per catty, Oolong tea was 28,000 New Taiwan dollars, and Penglai rice was 40 New Taiwan dollars per catty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] After our government announced the new measures for managing trade foreign exchange, Hong Kong's export trade has not changed significantly, but transactions have become sparse and market prices have fallen. Tung oil is 161 Hong Kong dollars per dan, tea oil is 205 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties, raw silk is 1.7 Hong Kong dollars per tael, and lower-grade Min tea is 22 Hong Kong dollars per dan. The main reasons for the sluggish market conditions are: (1) After the relaxation of export controls, the export center for our special products has shifted from Hong Kong to Shanghai. (2) Domestic export goods have risen in price, and Huai merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Arrives in Peiping from Shenyang; It is Said That Zuo Yisun and Lianzhong Hurry to Pay Their Respects</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in PanYang, 21st] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng took his staff to Peiping this morning and transferred to Nanjing. Xiong Shihui and others saw him off at the Peiping airport. Chiefs Gao and Zhang, Section Chief Chen, and others who came to Jin with Chen will not return to Nanjing for the time being because they have unfinished official business to attend to.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 21st] Chen Cheng flew to Peiping at 8:10 AM on the 21st. Chen had originally planned to visit Chengde en route, but when he flew to Chengde, he was unable to land due to airplanes in the narrow airport center. He flew directly to Peiping and arrived at Peiping Xiyuan Airport at 10:30 AM. Because the notification to various parties in Peiping was too late, only Air Force station personnel were present to take care of him when he got off the plane. He then took an Air Force Jeep into the city and encountered Li Zongren's welcoming car on the way. They went together to the Taiping Hutong reception center to rest. In the afternoon, Chief He Siyuan, Wu Qiwai, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Bojin, and others visited him. At 6:15 PM, Chen visited Hu Shi for a conversation, which lasted 45 minutes before he left.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 21st] After Chief of Staff Chen arrived in Peiping, there was an important meeting in Peiping. This afternoon, the local authorities successively dispatched planes to Zhangjiakou and Baoding to bring in Zuo Yi and Sun Lianzhong to Peiping to participate. Chuan arrived at 4:30 PM this afternoon, and Sun arrived in Peiping at the same time. Li Zongren hosted a banquet for Chief of Staff Chen at 8:00 PM in the evening, inviting Fu and Sun to accompany him. After participating, they went to the National Theater to watch Ma Lianliang's "Red Mane Fierce Horse."</p>
<h3>The Issue of Postponing the General Election Must Have a Legal Basis: Mr. Hui's Remarks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Our City] Recently, some people have requested the postponement of the general election, which has attracted widespread attention. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited State Councilor Dr. Yu Chonghui to inquire about his opinions. Mr. Wang agreed to see him despite his illness and provided a detailed critique of the issue of postponing the general election from a legal perspective, demonstrating Mr. Wang's careful and sincere concern for this issue. Mr. Wang said: The election affairs in various places have been gradually established, and all preparations for the general election are being actively carried out. If a decision is made to suspend it at this time, it would be a clear violation of the National Assembly's resolution. The resulting consequences will inevitably affect the effectiveness of any resolution passed by the National Assembly in the future and will directly affect the government's credibility. The importance of this matter cannot be overstated. The Green Government has both a legal and moral obligation to implement the National Assembly's resolutions. Therefore, from the government's standpoint, even if there are clearly many difficulties in the implementation process of any National Assembly resolution, it should not hesitate or yield. As far as this general election is concerned, whether to implement it is one question, and to what extent it can be implemented is clearly another question. In my personal opinion, in order to show a sincere commitment to fulfilling the spirit of the Constitution, the government should do its best to handle it according to the law and should not make any other considerations. Mr. Wang continued: What I have said above does not mean that I want to dismiss the reasons given by those who request a postponement. In fact, I share the same feelings as them, but what I am concerned about is that the National Assembly's resolutions cannot be changed lightly. Even if there is a need to do so, legitimate procedures must be followed and handled solemnly. It is reported that some National Assembly representatives intend to solicit the opinions of a majority of National Assembly representatives through communication to decide whether to postpone the election or not. I still have doubts about whether this method of communication is legitimate.</p>
<h3>Armed Rioters Stir Up Trouble in Turpan, Xinjiang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xining, 19th] Several hundred armed rioters in Turpan, Xinjiang, incited by a certain party, rioted and attacked the National Army stationed at Shengjinkou at 4:00 AM on July 12th. The National Army defended and counterattacked, and the rioters were defeated. In Lianmuqin, Handun, and Kumushi in Toksun, it was still discovered that bandits under the command of foreign chieftains were looting military supplies. They were dispersed after retaliation. Currently, the National Army is cooperating with the Xinjiang Provincial Government in offering comfort and is not pursuing the matter. However, rumors of the National Army killing people from Turpan have recently been discovered in Dihua City. From what is known, it is clear that a certain party is planning a deliberate provocation, attempting to destroy the feelings between the military and the people and to confuse the public.</p>

Wei's mission here is to investigate the facts and prepare a report for the US government's reference. There are no diplomatic documents between Wei and our country. The so-called presentation of a memorandum is not a fact. However, our government, at the beginning of the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional government, is determined to reform politics and economy, so it is quite hopeful to know Wei's opinion and believes that it will be able to consider the situation and adopt it.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] The government announced a blockade of Dalian, prohibiting foreign ships from entering or leaving, to prevent communication between the Shandong Communists and Dalian.

For months, the government has repeatedly spoken of the activities of Soviet ships between Dalian and Yantai. Once Yantai is secured, it can be used to supply troops by sea. According to a telegram from Jinan, the government admits that the entire Jiaoji Railway is in poor condition due to Communist sabotage and will take six months to a year to restore normal traffic.</p>
<p>[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] Due to the military victory in Shandong, various sectors in Shandong believe that the Ministry of Communications' original plan to repair the Jinpu Railway first and then the Jiaoji Railway after the rainy season next year is no longer applicable.

<h3>UNRRA's Transportation of Supplies to Communist Areas; Executive Yuan Committee Accepts Our Proposals in Principle; Modifications Proposed for Transportation Time and Routes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The UNRRA China Office announced yesterday: The UNRRA Central Executive Committee discussed the issue of suspending the transportation of supplies to North China at a meeting held in Washington on the 20th of this month. The Chinese government has accepted the new proposal from UNRRA in principle but has proposed some modifications to the transportation time and routes. The original proposal requested that the Chinese government agree to transport 50,000 tons of supplies to the Communist areas, with half being shipped through Yantai to Shandong and half entering the Communist areas along the canal south of Tianjin. The time allocation was for 10,000 tons to be shipped through Yantai in August, and 20,000 tons to be shipped through both locations in September and October. The Chinese government has currently agreed to ship 10,000 tons through Yantai in August. The transportation time and quantities for the canal route are temporarily unspecified. The UNRRA Central Executive Committee decided at its meeting on the 20th to notify the Chinese Communist Party of the Chinese government's proposal and to consult with them. Furthermore, during the week from August 8th to August 15th, a total of 12 ships unloaded 17,488 long tons of UNRRA supplies in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Fuzhou, and Taiwan. To date, the total amount of supplies shipped to China has reached 2,227,291 long tons.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The UNRRA Central Committee held a three-hour meeting today to consider the Chinese government's counter-proposal to UNRRA's proposed plan to transport and distribute relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas in North China. Reliable sources say that the Central Committee has recommended that the UNRRA China Office reach an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party, based on the agreement already reached with the Chinese government, to ship supplies to Yantai. At the same time, UNRRA still has the right to decide on the allocation of the total amount of 89,000 tons of withheld supplies, of which 50,000 tons were originally designated for Communist areas, and the remainder for areas controlled by the National Government. The Committee further recommended that after an agreement is reached with the Chinese Communist Party, the first shipment of supplies to Yantai will reach 10,000 tons, and the amount shipped to the Chinese government area is expected to increase to 25,000 tons. If the UNRRA Office in China fails to reach an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party based on its existing agreement with the Chinese government, the issue will be referred back to the Central Committee for discussion. It is understood that the Committee's recommendation also stipulates that all supplies shipped to the Chinese Communist Party area via Yantai must be approved by the Central Government and comply with the following conditions: The supplies must not be used by the Communist Party for military purposes, and the distribution of the supplies must be supervised by UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From the Tuition Problem to Rescuing Out-of-School Children</h3>
<p>The summer vacation of more than two months will soon come to an end, and schools at all levels, from elementary to university, will open in the next few weeks. This marks the beginning of the first semester of the thirty-sixth academic year. Those who graduated from elementary school last semester can enter junior high school this semester, those who graduated from junior high school can enter senior high school, and those who graduated from senior high school can enter university, representing new progress in their pursuit of education. Even those who are continuing their studies at the same school can advance to the next grade level. For most students, after more than two months of summer vacation, changing to a new environment should bring excitement and joy, and they should look forward to the early opening of school. However, under the current circumstances, with the exception of children from wealthy families, most young students are worried about the tuition fees for this semester. Parents are also frowning all day, figuring out how to raise this large sum. Therefore, the tuition fees of private schools have become the most pressing issue today.</p>
<p>Private vocational schools and universities in this city held a meeting of school presidents last week and decided on the standard for tuition fees for this semester, with the minimum being two million yuan. The details are being kept secret for now and are not yet known to the outside world. Presidents of famous private primary and secondary schools also held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided on the standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees: 600,000 yuan for primary school, 900,000 yuan for junior high school, and 1.2 million yuan for senior high school. The news has not only caused panic among students and parents but has also attracted the attention of society. The Municipal Bureau of Education has scheduled a meeting with the presidents of schools at all levels this afternoon to appeal on behalf of poor students and ask the schools to voluntarily reduce tuition and miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>In all fairness, under the current economic situation, the rise in prices is inevitable. For the sake of the livelihoods of teachers, it seems understandable that schools at all levels should increase tuition and miscellaneous fees. However, running a school is ultimately different from running a business. School authorities must consider the students' economic ability and must not adopt the attitude of "if you don't have money, don't come to school," allowing them to drop out of school. Looking at the facts, from January to July of this year, prices have increased three and a half times, but the fee standards decided by the school presidents' meeting are already more than three and a half times higher, which seems too much. Although the school presidents' meeting decided to increase fees in order to improve teachers' benefits, based on the actual situation of schools in the past, the increase in teachers' salaries is ultimately less than the increase in tuition fees. Therefore, we believe that the school presidents still need to reconsider the fee standards!</p>
<p>Running a school in the current environment is more difficult than any other business. However, during national reconstruction, education comes first. As the saying goes, "it takes a hundred years to cultivate a person." Education should be a national long-term plan. In principle, schools at all levels should be run by the state. However, after eight years of war against Japan, the country's vitality has been greatly damaged, and the Communist bandits' rebellion is consuming all of the country's energy. Taking Shanghai, the most developed city in education, as an example, according to a report from the National Education Department of the Bureau of Education, there are a total of 400,000 school-age children in the city, of which 250,000 attend private primary schools and only 150,000 attend municipal primary schools. This semester, the city's schools cannot increase the number of classes due to budget constraints. Based on this, the promotion of elementary education in Shanghai in the future will still rely on the assistance of private schools. Therefore, the public should not hold a contemptuous attitude toward private schools at all levels but should support them at all times. Regarding the issue of fees, all aspects should be considered to seek a reasonable solution. Do not engage in high-sounding rhetoric, ignore the actual difficulties, and force schools to reduce fees, which would make it impossible for schools to operate.</p>
<p>In short, it is expected that tuition fees will increase sharply this semester, and some students will inevitably drop out of school because they cannot afford to pay. Society must not stand idly by but should prepare early to expand the amount and scope of student aid so that these poor students will not be left wandering outside the school gates. In order to rescue out-of-school youth, this newspaper has decided to hold a scholarship campaign again. We advocate for society, hoping that people from all walks of life, with the spirit of "joy in helping students," will generously donate scholarships so that Shanghai will not see crowds of out-of-school youth!</p>
<h3>Concern for the Sichuan Floods</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's meeting on the 19th approved two relief cases for the floods in Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces. According to our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, the government's relief measures for the floods in the Xu-Hai and Huai areas and other seventeen counties and cities in northern Jiangsu include seven emergency relief measures, addressing both the root causes and the symptoms. This is a valuable comfort for the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu. The details of the Sichuan flood relief measures are not yet known. According to news reports and appeals from people from Sichuan in Beijing and Shanghai, the Sichuan flood situation is quite serious and requires urgent relief from all parties. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about the disaster in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance." It has a large area, a large population, abundant resources, and its agricultural production ranks first among the southwestern provinces. Its handicrafts and light industry have seen rapid development over the past decade. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chongqing, the wartime capital of the National Government, with the help of favorable weather, geographical conditions, and popular support, completed the victory of the War of Resistance. There was not a single flood or drought during those eight years, and there were abundant harvests every year, and the people lived in peace. This year, natural disasters and man-made disasters have occurred frequently in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and unfortunately, Sichuan has also suffered floods. Chengdu, the center of prosperity, has been largely submerged in water. The areas along the Min River, Tuo River, and Fu River, which cut across the northwestern Sichuan counties, are rich in agricultural production. In the past two months, they have suffered two major floods. Disaster victims are spread along the rivers, and highways have been washed away, making it impossible to travel by road. The details of the losses and the number of disaster victims are still impossible to count. In Chengdu alone, there are currently more than 100,000 disaster victims without homes, and property losses are estimated at over 10 billion yuan. According to people from Sichuan, this year's flood in Sichuan is unprecedented in the past eight years. The people have suffered this catastrophe, and the provincial government has only issued an empty document of relief. Who will give them some warmth? Who will provide them with some practical assistance? The disaster victims in Sichuan have no way out and can do nothing. Seeing that the autumn harvest is hopeless, security is worrying. How will they survive!</p>
<p>Now that the Executive Yuan has approved the Sichuan flood relief case, and people in Beijing and Shanghai are raising funds for relief, this will provide great comfort and encouragement to the people of Sichuan psychologically. Judging from the course of the War of Resistance, Sichuan has made a great contribution to the country and the nation. It can be said to be the base area of the War of Resistance. In terms of military service, Sichuan contributed the most manpower. In terms of grain requisition and loans, Sichuan contributed the most material resources. In terms of donations and public bonds, Sichuan contributed the most financial resources. Without Sichuan, China could not have persisted in the War of Resistance for eight years. Without the loyal cooperation of the people of Sichuan, the rear could not have had such stability during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Two years after the victory of the War of Resistance, the central government should not forget Sichuan, Shanghai industry and commerce should not forget Sichuan, and people from the north and south who once resided in Sichuan should not forget Sichuan. No matter how you look at it, Sichuan has suffered a major flood and should be sympathized with and helped. This is not a repayment of favors but a conscience and justice that human beings should have. We are concerned about the Sichuan floods and hope that people from all walks of life can have greater concern and extend a helping hand.</p>
<p>We must also point out that natural factors account for half of the cause of the Sichuan floods. The lack of water conservancy and poor planning are the greatest factors. The ten-odd counties surrounding Chengdu are rich in products. Their farmland irrigation relies on the Dujiang Dam in Guan County. However, the Dujiang Dam water conservancy project is still in its original state, lacking modernization. In addition, historical management is unclear, and management is unscientific. The Dujiang Dam has not only failed to benefit the people but has become a disaster for the people's livelihoods. This is an administrative error. We are concerned about the Sichuan floods and are even more concerned about the local administration and the construction of farmland water conservancy in Sichuan. We hope that the authorities in charge will learn a lesson from this flood and be vigilant!</p>

However, the chairman of the Chinese Association must submit the capitalists' new proposal to the strike committee for study, and a second negotiation will be held at 3:00 PM on the 21st after determining the counter-proposal.</p>

<h3>3,500 Tons of Siamese Relief Rice Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 20th] It is reported that, according to the established method, in addition to the allocation obtained from the World Emergency Food Conference, our country can still obtain 1,398 tons of rice from Siam for relief purposes. If, according to the established method, the Siamese Joint Rice Committee can collect 40,000 tons of rice from various rice mills for distribution to rice-deficient areas, then the overseas Chinese in Siam can obtain 5% of that amount as a "gift" for relief. If the rice mills cannot produce 40,000 tons of rice within a month, then this "gift" cannot be sent. However, if the rice mills produce more than 40,000 tons of rice, then the overseas Chinese relief organizations and other relevant institutions in Siam can obtain more than 5% of the rice. In March and April, the Siamese Joint Rice Committee will obtain sufficient rice and be able to ship 5,000 tons of relief rice to China.

<h3>Anglo-American-French Consultation on German Industrial Standards; Soviet Union Suddenly Protests, Claiming This Violates the Potsdam Agreement; US Decides to Ignore and Still Schedule Meeting in England Next Monday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): The Soviet Union has protested the Anglo-American-French negotiations on raising German industrial standards. According to US official sources, the US State Department has received a Soviet note opposing the three-power meeting, arguing that such talks violate the Potsdam Agreement. According to US officials, the US government has decided to ignore the Soviet protest and continue with all original plans. The three-power meeting is scheduled to open in London next Monday. Similar Soviet protests have been sent to Paris and London. The biggest reason for the Soviet protest is that France has allowed an increase in German steel production. The four powers had originally agreed to limit German steel production to 5.8 million tons per year, only 50% of the 1938 level. The Soviet Union believes that it has the right to participate and advise on any action to increase German industrial production. Earlier, the US and Britain had agreed to increase German industrial production in the US and British occupation zones in order to support the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe. The US insists that war reparations should not be taken from current production, but Molotov has argued in various meetings that reparations should be obtained from German current production.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The US Embassy here announced that Lieutenant General Clay, US military commander in Germany, and his political advisor will arrive in London by plane on the 21st to attend the three-power meeting to discuss German industrial standards. At the same time, Martin, Director of the Office of Economic Security of the State Department, and Gecob, head of the German-Austrian Group, will also come here as advisors to Ambassador Douglas.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Pound Conversion to US Dollars: Anglo-American Understanding Reached; Remaining Portion of US Loan to England Temporarily Frozen</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton suddenly announced today the temporary suspension of the conversion of pounds to US dollars. At the same time, Washington news indicated that the United States has agreed to take emergency measures to prevent the depletion of British dollar reserves. Dalton's announcement stated that after midnight today, anyone who obtains pounds in transactions with the British government or commercial firms, or through foreign exchange trading, will no longer have the automatic right to convert those pounds into US dollars, except for so-called American depositors. The current British economic situation is extremely severe. As of the end of July, Britain had withdrawn $2.75 billion of the $3.75 billion loan. Since August 10, another $242 million has been withdrawn, leaving only $758 million. Therefore, dollars must be conserved. However, holders of pounds are free to convert them into currencies other than US dollars. Restricting the conversion of US dollars will inevitably cause commercial turmoil and even hinder some supplies, which is regrettable, but unavoidable. If we hesitate, the situation will worsen. We hope that all parties understand that the government's decision is a wise measure, only intended to maintain the stable foundation of the pound and make it an international currency. This measure can also be said to mean that overseas assistance will continue to be lacking, and even the already scarce food rations in the country will be further reduced. In this emergency, laziness is a crime. We want to restore the national economy, and there is no other way than hard work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Anglo-American Economic Conference entered its third day today. The United States agreed to take emergency measures to prevent the depletion of British dollar reserves, while the British side agreed not to use the remaining portion of the $3.75 billion loan pending consultations and ordered the temporary suspension of the free conversion of pounds sterling into US dollars. This decision was announced simultaneously in Washington and London. In Washington, the statement was jointly signed and issued by Treasury Secretary Snyder and Deputy Secretary of State Lovett.</p>
<p>Five Policy Directions for the British Cabinet to Cope with the Economic Crisis</p>

He said that Britain will use five policy directions to resist economic difficulties: (1) Increase the production of necessities (coal, steel, and food); (2) Increase the quantity and value of exports so that Britain can purchase the necessary imports; (3) Reduce unnecessary or temporarily unnecessary consumption; (4) Reduce unnecessary or temporarily unnecessary investment and consumption; (5) Adjust overseas burdens.</p>
<h3>Applications for Membership by Italy, Austria, and Hungary Vetoed by the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): In today's Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union once again used its only magic weapon, the veto, and as a result, Italy and Austria's applications to join the United Nations were vetoed. Previously, US representative Johnson loudly appealed in support of the Italian and Austrian membership proposals.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): The Security Council today vetoed the Hungarian application for membership in the United Nations, with one vote in favor, one vote against, and nine abstentions.</p>
<h3>US Requests That the Balkan Dispute Be Included on the Agenda of the UN General Assembly to Counter Soviet Abuse of the Veto</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 20th] The United States today formally proposed that the Balkan dispute be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in September for discussion. This is the result of the Soviet Union's repeated use of the veto in the Security Council and the Council's admission that it is unable to resolve the case. US representative Johnson hopes that the General Assembly will act to stop the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece. United Nations Secretary-General Lie assured that this issue would be included on the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. According to Lai, Soviet representative Gromyko yesterday requested that the United Nations agency recall the inspection team stationed in the Balkans, which Lai firmly refused. Lai told reporters that the Balkan Investigation Committee inspection team was ordered by the Security Council to remain in Greece and would continue to remain until further notice. The Soviet Union believes that two uses of the veto have automatically liquidated the Investigation Committee and its team. This attitude has led some to speculate that the Soviet Union and Poland may immediately withdraw from the Investigation Committee and its team, but Gromyko and Podezin have made no indication. In any case, it is undoubtedly the case that the small paper will be denied entry into the Soviet Union's affiliated countries neighboring Greece.</p>
<h3>Marshall Urges American Nations to Unite to Protect the Security of the Western Hemisphere; Mutual Defense Treaty to Be Signed on September 7</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Petropolis, Brazil, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall said today at the Pan-American Conference that the economic reconstruction of Europe is extremely important to the economy of the Western Hemisphere. Marshall said in a speech to the General Assembly that the United States has undertaken a significant burden to meet the minimum economic needs of war-torn areas everywhere. But he also said: "In assuming this burden, we do not ignore the economic problems of the Western Hemisphere." The United States will continue to discuss economic issues with its sister republics and obtain a sound basis for practical cooperation. He said: "Our countries must do their best to achieve this goal." Marshall expressed his belief that the American republics will be able to solve the various problems encountered by the Western Hemisphere in the coming years. He said: "Today in Rio de Janeiro, we are concerned with the issue of mutual defense and security. Next January in Bogota (the capital of Colombia), we will continue to recognize and strengthen the American system."</p>
<p>[United Press, Petropolis, 21st] Reliable sources revealed that President Truman will address the Pan-American Defense Conference here on September 6, and the conference will continue until September 7, so that the Western Hemisphere Mutual Defense Treaty can be signed on the 125th anniversary of Brazil's independence.</p>

<h3>Scope of Operations Expanded for Foreign Banks in Japan</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur Headquarters previously permitted eight foreign banks to establish branches in Japan and start business. Now, it has further permitted these banks to handle various businesses related to Japan's foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Indonesia Actively Preparing for Protracted War; Hatta Appointed as Deputy Commander</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 21st (Broadcast): The Hague officially stated that if the Security Council cannot clearly order Indonesia to cease actions that violate the ceasefire agreement at the next meeting, the Dutch side will resume large-scale military operations. Although The Hague officials did not specify the nature of "large-scale military operations," it is widely expected that this is a prelude to the Dutch army's attack on the Indonesian capital.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta, 21st] Radio Yogyakarta broadcast today that the Indonesian North and Country is preparing to move the capital to Sumatra. Vice President Hatta, now in Sumatra, is the government's plenipotentiary representative and will be assisted by a committee composed of one representative from each department. Hatta was also appointed as Deputy Commander of the Indonesian Army.</p>
<h3>Seoul Conference on Establishing an Independent and Unified Korea Nears Collapse; US Preparing to Return the Matter to the Four Powers for Resolution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] According to reliable sources, the US-Soviet Joint Commission currently meeting in Seoul is expected to completely break down, and the unification of the North and South Korean occupation zones will inevitably fail. Therefore, the United States has reportedly prepared to return the entire Korean issue to the four signatory countries of the Moscow Agreement (China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union) for resolution. According to Seoul news obtained by Japan, the Soviet Union will not agree with Marshall's request to Molotov on August 13 that the Commission submit a full report on Korea.</p>
<p>It is also learned that US officials have very little hope that a successful resolution can be achieved after the Korean issue is handed over to the four powers, and are preparing to submit it to the United Nations for consideration and final decision. The US official attitude towards the Korean issue may be announced around August 21, which is the date Marshall designated for the Commission to submit its report. It is reported that the US delegation attending the Seoul Commission will submit a report to the State Department tomorrow for consideration, and the United States will also plan to take what steps to complete the Moscow Agreement to establish an independent and unified Korea.</p>
<p>Korean Communist Ambitions Increasingly Apparent</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] "Chicago Daily News" reporter Herles recently cabled from Seoul that this troubled land in the East is filled with fear of a large-scale communist-inspired revolution. It is reported that copies of the main plans for various steps to occupy Korea by force have fallen into the hands of the US military authorities. The initial actions taken by the Soviet army in this area are the same as the steps taken in some Balkan countries, that is, training and equipping the North Korean army. It is estimated that the number of troops trained there is about 150,000, and it may have recently increased to 500,000. It is widely rumored here that about 80,000 of these troops are receiving combat training in the Chinese Communist army fighting in Northeast China.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Seoul Conference</h3>
<p>— Pan Shixian</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The situation of the United States and the Soviet Union stationing troops and occupying Korea is, in a way, similar to the situation in Europe where the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union stationed troops and occupied Germany. In Germany, the occupied zones are distinctly divided, and recently, the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe and the European Economic Recovery Conference led by Britain and France have formed a sharp confrontation with the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc. The division along the 38th parallel in Korea is naturally also easy to understand. Speaking of this, I cannot help but express a bit of injustice on behalf of the Korean people. Germany was the main culprit of Nazism and one of the main perpetrators of World War II, and it deserves to be divided and ruled today. Korea, however, was a nation that suffered under Japanese imperialism for more than forty years, and it was also a region that the four major Allied powers guaranteed would be liberated and independent. The current situation of divided occupation not only prevents Koreans from establishing their unified and independent nation but also makes it impossible for the Korean people to solve their most basic personal living problems. The four major nations that allowed and assisted in the liberation and independence of Korea should deeply reflect on this.</p>
<p>It has been more than two months since the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission resumed its meeting this year. Judging from the news coming from Seoul, it has fallen back into the stalemate that existed after May of last year. The issues that have stalled the negotiations are still the same as last year, namely the selection of which Korean political parties and groups to include. This situation will not be resolved in the short term. General Wedemeyer has not yet arrived in Korea. Once General Wedemeyer submits his report on Korea to the U.S. State Department, the Seoul conference will immediately reflect the result of whether the problem will be solved or will break down. The Korean problem cannot be solved in Korea; it is determined in Washington and Moscow.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>At the present stage, the issue of the eligibility of political parties for consultation, on which the United States and the Soviet Union have conflicting opinions, is merely a superficial aspect of the deadlock in the U.S.-Soviet conference. The real issue is the differing interpretations of "democracy" by the United States and the Soviet Union. If the two interpretations can gradually converge, then the problem of Korean political parties can also be gradually resolved.</p>
<p>In addition to the fundamental issue mentioned above, there are some practical problems that are quite difficult to solve.</p>
<p>First: Regarding the internal political relations of Korea, how will the land policy be adjusted after the establishment of a unified North-South Korean government in the future? This issue is worth studying in advance. After Japan surrendered, in the U.S. occupation zone, the New Korean Corporation established under the auspices of the U.S. took over the land of the Japanese. How this land will be distributed to the Korean people in the future should certainly be studied. In the Soviet occupation zone, the methods of taking over and disposing of land are different. In northern Korea, the Soviet Union not only took over the land of the Japanese but also confiscated the land of Korean landlords, and has now distributed these taken-over and confiscated lands to farmers. The several thousand Koreans who reportedly secretly crossed the 38th parallel blockade line and fled to the U.S. occupation zone were these landlords. The U.S. opposes the Soviet Union's land policy. Since the policies of the two sides are different and each acts according to its own, the longer the time goes on, the more difficult the problem becomes to solve.</p>
<p>Second: Regarding the military organization, in both the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones, military training programs, whether open or secret, regular or irregular, are being carried out. Reports of the Soviet Union training a Korean Red Army in northern Korea have spread throughout the world. In addition, the training of so-called communist youth leagues and the training of public security police can also be said to be forms of disguised military training. As for southern Korea, although the Korean Liberation Army and the Korean Volunteer Corps, which had been in exile in China and had actually fought against Japan alongside the Allied forces, were denied armed return to Korea, the current U.S. occupying forces have approved the establishment of an officers' school with Koreans who had served as Japanese army sergeants as instructors. Military training of other various groups and political-military training of the police are also very active. In order to maintain local security, local defense forces are being organized in areas where there are no U.S. troops stationed. This is also a form of military training and organization.</p>
<p>Third: Regarding diplomatic relations, the relations between either the People's Committee of Northern Korea or the Provisional Government of Southern Korea and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot be considered normal diplomatic relations because neither of the Korean entities in power has been internationally recognized. However, since both the United States and the Soviet Union have established relations with the regimes they support and have obtained the benefits they seek, how can the United States and the Soviet Union be willing to give up their vested interests when a unified Korean government is formed in the future and negotiations are held on the rights and obligations to be inherited from the two regional regimes? It is said that the Soviet Union has signed an agreement with the People's Committee of Northern Korea that allows the Soviet Union to use Korean waterways, roads, and ice-free ports. The validity period of this agreement is thirty years. After a unified Korean government is established in the future, will the Soviet Union be willing to give up this right? If the agreement is still valid, will it also apply to southern Korea? Will the United States also demand equal rights? Will this kind of treaty be a problem for Korean independence?</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Although the future of the Seoul conference is not optimistic, for the sake of the lives of the thirty million Korean people, the United States and the Soviet Union should use all possible means to break this deadlock. If both the United States and the Soviet Union believe that the method of direct negotiation, like the negotiations held before May of last year and the current negotiations, cannot lead to a conclusion, then they can also change the method. If both the United States and the Soviet Union are sincere in breaking the deadlock and are willing to consider more neutral, moderate, and compromise opinions, can they invite China and Britain to participate in the negotiations to resolve the Korean problem? In this way, it would be easier to find conciliatory and compromise opinions and obtain a rational way to resolve the Korean problem. I believe this is what the Korean people earnestly expect. However, to sum up, the future of the Seoul conference depends on whether the United States and the Soviet Union have the sincerity to solve the Korean problem.</p>

<h3>Bathhouse Workers' Petition Incident - Great View Garden Destroyed - Chairman Injured - Forty-Four Perpetrators Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 400 bathhouse workers and members of the bathhouse industry trade union in the city, demanding the release of two arrested workers, went to the city government to see Mayor Wu at 5 p.m. the night before but did not meet him. At 10 a.m. yesterday, they went to the city government to petition again. The authorities did not receive them, stating that the arrested workers had acted improperly and had already been transferred to the court for interrogation. The petitioning crowd dispersed at 1 p.m. and advised colleagues along the way to join the petition. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 p.m., more than 100 workers in the industry, because their petition to the city government had yielded no results, marched to the Great View Garden Bathhouse on Mud City Bridge, demanding that the manager, Yang Shaoxiong, the current chairman of the bathhouse industry association, explain the reason for his failure to mediate this time. Seeing the threatening situation, Yang avoided an accident by hiding in a small loft on the third floor, refusing to come out. This provoked the anger of the crowd, and some of the workers destroyed the equipment of the bathhouse. They then rushed upstairs and into the loft. The loft was small and crowded, and it suddenly collapsed, seriously injuring Yang on the spot. The Old City Police Station, after being fully informed, sent a large number of police officers to the scene, arrested 44 workers involved in the incident and took them to the station for interrogation, and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>According to Shen, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor-management dispute at the bathhouse had already been settled with a mediation record, and work was originally scheduled to resume yesterday. The owner of the bathhouse was confused by superstition and insisted on choosing an auspicious day to reopen, leading to the misunderstanding. According to another source, the employer had previously reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, stating that they would dismiss Peng Zhaolin, Kong Shishi, and 13 other workers who were lazy and inactive. The Social Affairs Bureau has now sent a letter to the Penglai Police Station requesting a report on the handling of this labor-management dispute before further review.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Request Price Adjustments - City Government Sends Personnel to Beijing to Report and Request Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the government implemented new foreign exchange control measures, the cost of various public utilities in the city is expected to increase, but the central government has stipulated that price increases are not allowed to avoid stimulating inflation. In order to allow public utilities to temporarily maintain their original prices and to take into account the losses of employers, the City Government's Public Utilities Bureau sent Xu Zhaolin, director of the technical office, and Liu Shengqu, chief of the telecommunications section, to Beijing the night before, to report to the National Economic Commission and request instructions. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai this morning. It is reported that the main purpose of their trip to Beijing is to request the central government to allocate official foreign exchange for the fuel and accessories needed by public utilities. If the central government approves the original price of coal, the public utilities in the city are expected not to raise prices.</p>
<p>It is reliably learned that the public utility companies' requests to adjust prices and their detailed income and expenditure records have been submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for careful review. Whether or not to allow the adjustments will be decided after Director Xu and others return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Store Rice to Prevent Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the amendment to the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations, the municipal authorities have been closely monitoring price fluctuations. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently preparing to store a large amount of rice in preparation for the resumption of the dumping policy in case of rice price fluctuations, in order to suppress market prices. The authorities are also considering expanding the distribution scope and increasing the distribution volume.</p>
<h3>Movie Ticket Price Increase Delayed - Surcharge for Disaster Relief - Method Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The cinema industry agreed to contribute 3 billion yuan to the flood relief efforts in Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Jiangsu, but because the various cinemas found it difficult to determine the distribution standard, and foreign film distributors did not agree, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that he would change the method and propose to levy a certain amount of disaster relief surcharge on each movie ticket, to be collected and delivered by the Finance Bureau. This disaster relief surcharge must be submitted to the City Council for approval before it can be levied. Therefore, the originally planned 100% increase in movie ticket prices will be reduced if a separate disaster relief surcharge is levied. Director Wu will report on this matter at this morning's municipal government meeting, so the increase in movie ticket prices will be delayed.</p>
<h3>Party Member Representative Congress Opens on the 24th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Congress of Party Members of the Chinese Kuomintang, decided by the executive committee of the municipal party headquarters yesterday, will hold its opening ceremony at 9 a.m. on the 24th at the main hall of the Municipal Council, and re-elect all executive and supervisory committee members. Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, will be sent by the Central Committee to supervise the election. The congress is scheduled to last for two days, the 24th and 25th. Representatives from each district are scheduled to start registering at 2 p.m. today in the main hall of the municipal party headquarters, and the deadline is tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>City Government's Budget for Next Year Cannot Be Prepared at Present</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city government's budget for next year cannot be prepared at present due to the excessive gap between revenue and expenditure. According to Min Fan, director of the accounting office of the city government, he has asked all bureaus and departments to reduce expenditures as much as possible and find ways to increase revenue, such as rectifying tax collection. The budgets of all departments are limited to the routine maintenance costs for next year. Temporary expenses and new construction project costs will be handled later when the city's finances improve next year. The above budget is expected to be submitted within days. If the total still exceeds revenue, another reduction will be requested, with the principle of living within one's means.</p>
<p>It is also claimed that the supplementary budget for the city government's bureaus and departments this year has reached 48 times as of yesterday. Thirty-seven times have been submitted to the City Council for approval, and eleven have not yet been approved.</p>
<h3>Wedding Ceremony Innovation - Notarization by a Qing Dynasty Judge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shen Fuxiang and Cao Mingshan applied to the district court to have a judge attend and notarize their marriage.

<h3>UNRRA Records are Extensive - Inspection and Investigation are Time-Consuming - Hope for Reconciliation in Xu-Liu Brawl - Postponement of Distribution Director's Flight to the North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Bi Gaokui, the newly appointed Director of the General Affairs Department of UNRRA, took office yesterday. Xu Shichang, his predecessor, will now serve as a commissioner. Although Xu stated that he would sue Liu Dehui, director of the welfare section of the UNRRA Relief Department, who had brawled with him, some UNRRA staff members said that Xu and Liu were close relatives. Moreover, Liu's backer, Xiang Jingyun (Director of the Investigation Department of UNRRA), returned to Shanghai from Hunan yesterday, so there is hope for reconciliation in this case.</p>
<p>After the incident of six senior UNRRA officials being accused of group corruption, the atmosphere was quite tense. However, according to those familiar with the UNRRA situation, the authorities' investigation work is quite difficult. The sheer volume of UNRRA's files and records not only requires a considerable amount of time but also requires several experts who are extremely familiar with technical work. Otherwise, in terms of the valuation of UNRRA's supplies, there will be a feeling of being at a loss. As for the rumor that Li Zhuomin, the deputy director of UNRRA, has sole control of power, Li did firmly request to resign when the former director, Jiang Tingfu, resigned, but Director Huo firmly retained him. Because Director Huo is very busy with all external liaison affairs, the administrative and personnel affairs in the department are indeed entrusted to Li for full handling.</p>
<p>Liu Guangpei Accused More Than Once</p>
<p>In addition, the position of Director of the Northeast Branch of the Agency has been decided to be taken over by the Deputy Director, Nan Bingfang, after Liu Guangpei was dismissed. It is reliably learned that UNRRA planned to transfer Liu internally as an advisor to the General Department as early as last autumn and winter, and to have Lu Guangmian, the current Director of the Relief Department, succeed Liu, but after the official announcement, it was withdrawn due to other reasons, and Liu remained in office. However, this is not the first time Liu has been accused. Therefore, when the Director of the Department of Distribution, Fu Sheng, was ordered to go to investigate, he brought several specialists with him to conduct a more detailed assessment. Fu was originally scheduled to depart yesterday, but it was postponed due to some reason. On the Supervisory Commissioner's Office side, Supervisory Commissioner Yan stated that he was strictly investigating, but he kept silent about the actual investigation situation. According to UNRRA, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office did not send anyone to the Agency to investigate.</p>
<p>Stamping Important Relief Items After Review</p>
<p>He Huimin, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office handling the case, did not go to UNRRA and related agencies for investigation yesterday due to other cases pending. It is said that the UNRRA accounts are as vast as an ocean and it is difficult to find any clues for the time being. However, the Director's seal is added to important accounts after review to prevent alterations. As for the sealing of accounts and documents, it is feared that it will affect the agency's official duties, so it has not yet been considered.</p>
<p>As for Director Huo Shishu, who went to Beijing to report on his duties, is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Five More Illegally Installed Intercoms Removed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau continued to send personnel to the Mainland Building, Overseas Chinese Building, Enterprise Building, and the Sichuan Road area yesterday to remove illegally installed intercoms, together with personnel from the Public Utilities Bureau and the Telephone Company. As of the afternoon, Qingfu, Huayi, Qitai, Qicheng, and Gaoyi Securities Companies were found to have illegally installed intercoms and had them removed.</p>
<h3>Paint Store Manager and Deputy Manager Prosecuted for Unauthorized Lending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xue Berlin and Huang Jiming, who illegally operated an underground bank, were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to the indictment, Xue, residing at No. 6 Qujiang Lane, Hankou Road, is the manager of the Hua Kang Paint Store, and Huang is the deputy manager. Since October of last year, in addition to buying and selling paints, Hua Kang Store also engaged in unauthorized deposit and remittance services, with a deposit interest rate of 15% and a lending interest rate as high as 20%. The daily turnover reached 500 million yuan at its peak. Hua Kang Store also made a lot of profit from the intermediary exploitation. In May of this year, after the Garrison Headquarters learned of this, it sent the case to the Central Bank, which then requested the Ministry of Finance to investigate and then sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. After interrogation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the two defendants, Xue and Huang, were indeed suspected of illegally operating an underground bank and disrupting financial order.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng Has No Private Theatrical Performance - Charity Performance Held for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>August 30 is the 60th birthday of Mr. Du Yuesheng. Friends from all walks of life originally planned to launch a grand celebration ceremony. Taking advantage of the arrival of famous performers from the north and south in Shanghai to celebrate his birthday, they planned to hold a private theatrical performance to add to the festivities. After Mr. Du learned of this, he believed that at a time when the whole country was practicing thrift, he did not want to hold a celebration for himself and waste manpower and resources, and repeatedly declined the celebration ceremony. In order to comply with Mr. Du's wishes, the Preparatory Committee decided not to hold a private theatrical performance on Mr. Du's birthday. At that time, under the principle of no extravagance, a simple birthday celebration would be held at the Lido Garden, with only simple vegetarian noodles to entertain the guests. However, in order to commemorate Mr. Du's achievements, a call for contributions was issued to solicit poems and essays from celebrities at home and abroad, and compiled into a book for admiration. Moreover, Mr. Du has always adhered to the principle of self-denial and benefiting others. In view of the serious floods in various places, which urgently need relief, he plans to take advantage of the opportunity of the gathering of famous performers from the north and south to discuss and request them to perform a few days of charity performances, and all the proceeds will be used for disaster relief, which has nothing to do with the birthday theatrical performance. Du's friends deeply approve of this spirit of turning private matters into public service. As for the charity performance program, date, and location, they are still under discussion and have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Fu Zhengmo Reports on Conscription in His Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, hosted reporters at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon and reported that Shanghai was allocated 3,000 conscripts, and conscription will begin on September 5 and be completed before mid-September. In addition to a settlement allowance of 4.05 million yuan per recruit entering the camp in the city, each recruit will also be issued daily necessities such as military blankets, straw mats, shoes, and socks. The Military Service Association will donate a set of uniforms. Family members regularly enjoy various preferential treatments. Fu also reported on the conscription situation of the Wu County and Songjiang Regimental Districts under the jurisdiction of the Garrison District, stating that the Wu County Regimental District will conscript more than 3,500 people and the Songjiang Regimental District will conscript more than 4,300 people. The Wu County Regimental District has now conscripted more than 1,300 people and will be able to complete the conscription by the end of this month. The Songjiang Regimental District has dispatched cadres to various counties in its jurisdiction to receive recruits, and will be able to conscript two-thirds by the end of this month, and all of them can be conscripted by mid-next month. Fu appealed to all sectors of society to assist in promoting military service. If military service personnel are found to be involved in corruption, he hoped that citizens would report them and they would be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Uninvited Guest - Swindles Cash, Steals Jewelry</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Zhuang Zhikan, a resident of No. 14, Jingxi Lane, Changle Road, was not at home the other day when an uninvited guest suddenly appeared, claiming to be Xu Junli, a friend of Mr. Zhuang. He said Zhuang owed him 1,000,000 yuan in legal tender. He then took out a check for 1,200,000 yuan from his pocket, politely asking Mrs. He to cash it for 200,000 yuan. She, suspecting nothing, opened the drawer of her dressing table to retrieve the money. Inside, there were gold and diamond ornaments, which caught his eye with their dazzling brilliance. An evil thought arose. Taking advantage of Mrs. He stepping into the kitchen, he quickly stole a gold chain, gold lock, gold pound, jade ring, gold ring, gold bracelet, jade bangle, a set of longevity gold buttons, a pair of earrings, and two diamond rings before leaving.

<h3>Major Smuggling - Indictment for Corruption - Sun Keqin Case to Open on the 30th</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Meiqi General arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 7th of this month, carrying a large quantity of valuable smuggled goods, which upon investigation, belonged to Sun Keqin. Sun had previously served in the Jianghai Customs, the Headquarters of the Third War Area, and the Imports Management Office, using his personal connections to smuggle thirteen large boxes of goods, including woolens, on board the ship. These were seized by customs on the spot. The value of the smuggled goods was enormous, making it impossible to estimate immediately. The Jianghai Customs immediately handed the case over to the District Procuratorate for investigation, which indicted him on charges of corruption.

<h3>Good Men Should Enlist - Military Service is a National Duty - Talking About Conscription Procedures During the Conscription Period</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] This city's conscription quota for this year is 3,000 men. The Ministry of National Defense has ordered the conscription to be completed before the 15th of next month. The Military Service Association recently held a meeting and decided that volunteer soldiers will begin registering from the 25th of this month. The barracks for the new recruits are also being repaired and must be completed within half a month, after which the recruits will receive training at the Infantry Camp. However, as of now, many people are still unclear about the various provisions, procedures, and conscription formalities of the military service. To provide readers with a clear understanding of the implementation of military service, we will provide a brief explanation here:</p>
<p>The authorities have stipulated that the city's military quota will be achieved through both recruitment and conscription, meaning that volunteer soldiers will be recruited first, and the shortfall will be made up through conscription according to law. Based on population ratio, Shanghai should conscript 6,000 people. However, since Shanghai is an important center for national defense industries, there are more people who are exempt or have their service deferred, reducing the quota to 3,000. According to the household registration survey results, there are currently 231,537 men of military age in the city. With a ratio of 3,000 men, an average of one soldier will be selected from every 77 people. Generally, it is believed that it will be easy to recruit 3,000 volunteer soldiers. If that is the case, Shanghai can avoid conscription this year. If the number falls short, conscription will be carried out according to law.</p>
<p>Before conscription, four steps need to be completed: background investigation, application for exemption/deferment, physical examination, and drawing lots. The background investigation work in this city has already been completed. The review of applications for exemption/deferment is currently underway. This step involves a wide range of issues and is the most contentious, so it takes longer. If this step is done well, the physical examination and lottery will be easier to carry out later.</p>
<p>Several Regulations Regarding Exemptions, Prohibitions, Deferments and Postponements</p>
<p>Applications for exemption, prohibition, deferment, and postponement of military service are limited to the following categories: (1) Those with physical deformities or disabilities or chronic illnesses that make them unfit for military service (with certificates from doctors and Baojia chiefs); (2) Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for seven years or more (with judgment); (3) Those going abroad on official business (with government approval certificate or other documentary proof); (4) Students in high school or above who have not graduated (with school certificate); (5) Those who are being prosecuted for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a minimum of imprisonment or are serving a sentence of imprisonment (with indictment from court and other documentary proof or judgment); (6) Currently employed specialized technical personnel involved in national defense industries who have been examined and approved (with graduation certificate, technical training certificate, and service certificate from the competent authority); (7) Those who have graduated from teacher-training schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and are currently working as primary school teachers for more than one year and have passed the examination (with certificate of passing the examination); (8) Those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families and have no siblings, or have siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under 18 years of age (with certificate from Baojia chiefs or certificate of service in the military); (9) Those suffering from illnesses that have been proven to make them unfit for combat duty (with doctor's certificate); (10) Public servants of various government agencies who have graduated from high school or above and obtained a military training certificate (with military training certificate and certificate from the head of the government agency). In addition, all men of military age are subject to conscription. Although Ji Feng, the representative of the Communist Party stationed at the Head Office, is of military age, Mayor Wu believes that he has lost the qualifications for military service and will not allow him to serve. From these, we affirm that military service is a sacred duty to the country. Those who betray the country should not be allowed to dishonor the dignity of national law.</p>
<p>Several Agencies in Charge of Military Service</p>
<p>After applying for exemption or deferment, the application will first be investigated by the Bao office, then reviewed by the district, and finally jointly reviewed by the municipal government and the Military Service Association at a review meeting. The list of men of military age who have been approved for exemption or deferment will be distributed to the districts for publication. This work will then be completed. Then, physical examinations will be conducted on a regular basis, and lots will be drawn. The men of military age who are selected will await orders for conscription into the army.</p>
<p>In this city, in addition to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters are two military agencies responsible for supervising and training new recruits. The Military Service Association is legally composed of the heads of various agencies to assist in the implementation of military service. The Association has six committees: propaganda, preferential treatment, physical examination, exemption/deferment review, lottery, and handover. Regarding the preferential treatment measures for volunteer soldiers, the Association has already decided to give each family a settlement fee of 50,000 yuan and a housing subsidy of 4,000,000 yuan. This money will be paid by men of military age who are exempted or deferred, divided into three levels: A (300,000 yuan), B (150,000 yuan), and C (30,000 yuan), to be paid when the exemption/deferment certificate is issued. The remaining amount will be donated by households that do not contribute soldiers. The measures are currently being drafted. As for the volunteer soldier recruitment methods, application forms and guarantee letters for volunteer soldiers can be obtained from the Bao office. After filling them out clearly and affixing the seal, they should be submitted to the Bao office for registration. After registration, they should wait for notification of the physical examination at their original residence. Those who pass the examination will be sent to the new recruit conscription center to await assignment. In terms of procedures, volunteer soldiers are simpler than conscripted soldiers.</p>
<p>Volunteer Soldier Registration is Extremely Enthusiastic</p>
<p>As of now, there are those who voluntarily offer their services, asking to be enlisted as volunteer soldiers, complying with national laws, and serving in the military. One is Cao Xianglin, age 50, currently a cashier at the British tram company. He wants to use his enthusiasm to inject a dose of confidence into Shanghai's 230,000 men of military age, and has written to Mayor Wu requesting a special recommendation. There are also Gu Ye'an, the executive member and secretary of the Fifth Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and Party member Fang Shih-hao, who responded to Chairman Chiang's call and took the lead in applying for voluntary service. There are still many well-known and unknown patriots who are requesting to register as volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>Conversely, the ugly dramas of unwarranted conscription and selling soldiers have occurred frequently in recent times. Several cases have been investigated and found to be true. Mayor Wu has stated that he will deal with them severely. Commander Fu Zhengmo hopes that citizens will report the truth. Director Zhang Xiaosong hopes to obtain cooperation from all parties to eliminate the corruption of wartime military service and make Shanghai's military administration a model for the whole country.</p>

The slogans should be concise and eye-catching, and will be divided into first and second prizes. (2) The competent authorities will contact film companies to collect traffic safety materials and compile and produce films based on various car accident situations, which will be screened in rotation in various cinemas. (3) The Bureau of Education will issue a circular to all primary schools to fully instill traffic safety knowledge to school-age children in the common sense subject.</p>

The building was once occupied by the Japanese puppet regime. After the victory, the newspapers jointly recovered the building and resumed publication at the original site. The newspapers have repeatedly paid rent to the landlord and continued to rent the building, but the company refused, instead using this as an excuse to file a lawsuit in court requesting eviction.

<h3>Visitor from North of Beitashan - Grand Duke Reminisces - Turbulent Waves on the Bulgan River - Camel Bells Weep for Lost Territory</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] "We must let people know that the Mongolian banners still exist in Xinjiang, amidst the clamor for East Turkestan." This was a remark made by Mr. Wu Zhongxin when he was the Chairman of Xinjiang Province. Now, as the Kazakh compatriots suffer in Beitashan, it is again brought to mind. Twenty years ago, north of Beitashan, in the fertile Bulgan River basin, the Mongolian compatriots of eleven banners had already fallen into the clutches of evil.</p>
<p>Damdingtsereng, the Jasagh Zhenguo Gong of the Khoshut Banner in Xinjiang, after more than twenty years of wandering, came to the capital a week ago, met with Chief Administrative Officer Wu, and was hired as a consultant to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He will soon return to live in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>For Twenty Years, No Peace</p>
<p>When our reporter interviewed him, he spoke sadly about the historical facts of that time and his feelings over the past twenty-nine years, through the interpreter Mr. Chen Shiduo. He longed for the fertile land, grass, flocks of sheep, and herdsmen along the Bulgan River where he grew up. "In the second year of the Republic [1913], after the Sino-Russian and Sino-Mongolian agreements on the demarcation of territories and borders between Kobdo and Altai, in the third year of the Republic [1914], the Beijing government sent three commissioners to survey the border. Each banner sent banner officials to accompany them. I was only twenty-nine years old at the time, and I personally walked the border of Altai. Later, Altai was reorganized into the A-shan Circuit. Our Khoshut Banner, the Zakhchin Banner, and the New Torgut Two Banners, a total of four banners, were set up as Bulgan County. In addition, the Uriangkhai Seven Banners were set up as Qinghe County. The Alshan Oirat Mongolian Eleven Banners had ten years of peaceful life. But in April of the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], disaster suddenly struck. Outer Mongolian troops crossed the border and invaded, and the people, land, and property of the two counties and eleven banners were all looted. Only three of the eleven banner Jasaghs managed to escape. I went to Dihua at the time and saw Governor-General Yang Zengxin, who also suggested that I go to Beijing, but I couldn't do so because of transportation difficulties. Later, when Jin Shuren became Governor-General, the situation no longer allowed for action. By the time of Sheng Shicai, it was impossible to even talk about coming to the mainland. Recently, Beitashan was invaded again, so Director Zhang let me come to Nanjing to report the situation to the authorities. For twenty years, the area north of Beitashan has never had a day of peace. Qinghe, Bulgan, Chahan Tonggu, and finally Beitashan, which is more than 600 li from the Altai Kobdo border, have also been invaded.</p>
<p>Rich Pastures, Endless Treasures</p>
<p>He paused, and then talked about the richness of the A-shan area:</p>
<p>"The Bulgan River basin is the best pasture, and there is also a lot of farmland. The Uriangkhai Seven Banner area (Qinghe County) is the richest gold mining area. The local people have always lived a wealthy life. Furs, livestock products, gold, silver, oil, countless treasures. Not far from the confluence of the four rivers, two Qinghe Rivers (Anle River), one Chahan River (White River), and one Bulgan River (Spring River), there is a place called Nalen Mandu (Sun Flourishing), where there is a mountain in the shape of a reclining camel. The white silver ore is completely exposed, and no one knows how deep it is underneath. But now everything is gone."</p>
<p>A Cage That Only Lets In, Not Out</p>
<p>"How are the Mongolian compatriots of the eleven banners doing now? Do they want to come back?" The reporter's question brought a bitter smile to his face.</p>
<p>"The border of Outer Mongolia is like a money cage. Once you go in, you can forget about coming out. In Dihua, I only occasionally have merchants who sneak across the border to see me, saying that the people of the eleven banners live under the oppression of conscription and taxation, and they don't even have the freedom to kill one of their own sheep to eat. They all hope to return to their homeland. This is a matter for the country. I believe the country will not abandon this large and fertile territory, nor will it abandon the tens of thousands of loving compatriots."</p>
<p>"We also hope that the territory, which is about the size of Zhejiang Province, can be recovered soon, so that Grand Duke Da can see the people of his banner again as soon as possible," the reporter said as he said goodbye.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is the only thing I have hoped for in this life!" His voice was touchingly agitated. I seemed to see the white silver camel in his eyes. (Reported by Pu Dejie).</p>

<h3>New Director of Taiwan News Bureau, Lin Tzu-kuei Takes Office</h3>

During the War of Resistance, Mr. Lin served as a specialist committee member of the Central Propaganda Department, a member and secretary of the Chinese Language Committee, and a specialist committee member for general mobilization.

<h3>Corruption Cases Occur Continuously in Pingyang County; Selling Public Relief Flour to Obtain High Profits for Personal Gain</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 21st] Two corruption cases have occurred continuously in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province. The Pingyang section of the Ruiping Highway Construction Committee colluded with party leaders Xiao Han-chieh, Wu Bo, and others, using their positions and under the guise of resolutions, to privately contract with merchants such as Zhou Heng-shun to sell all 30 tons of public relief flour, and then withheld the proceeds. Upon receiving the report, the provincial government ordered strict punishment according to the law, and the county court has already filed charges. Furthermore, the North-South Port Water Conservancy Office of the county used over 200 tons of public relief flour to offset 50% of the advance payments to contractors, while still requesting the provincial government to allocate 240 million yuan, which was then transferred to the Wenzhou Zhenhai Industrial Bank and the Second Industrial Bank to obtain high profits for personal gain. This has been reported by the provincial bank and is currently being investigated by the Construction Department.</p>

<h3>Xiaoshan Nansha Embankment Construction Bureau Builds Bulkheads to Resist Sea Tides</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 21st] The Huangshan Nansha Embankment Construction Bureau, in addition to the previously allocated 400 tons of flour, will allocate another 1.2 billion yuan after the funds for this year arrive. As for the construction, the Embankment Construction Bureau has been handling it exclusively this month. The bulkheads built in the past half-month have already been able to resist the sea tides, with waves reaching heights of twenty to thirty zhang. However, the autumn tides are fierce and dangerous, so optimism is difficult.

<h3>Haining Chenwen Port Project Requires 13 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 21st] The Qianjiang Seawall Construction Bureau's Deputy Director told reporters today that the bureau's engineering funds for the 36th year, totaling 13 billion yuan, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Construction Department, along with the engineering plan. Once these funds arrive, the construction of a 1,000-meter-long reinforced concrete seawall at Haining Chenwen Port will begin. This project only accounts for one-third of the total gap. The remaining 2,300 meters will be funded by the Executive Yuan, which will allocate 8.6 billion yuan in February of next year. Additionally, the local collection of agricultural land beneficiary fees, amounting to 4.4 billion yuan annually, will be used as funding for further construction. The plan to build a long spillway dam near Jianshan to divert the Qianjiang River's flow is being actively developed, with mountain clearing, pile driving, and railway construction being carried out in three parts. The latter has already completed three kilometers. Furthermore, to alleviate transportation difficulties, the bureau has been allocated two steamers and seven tugboats by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, two of which will be used as ferries, and half of them have already arrived at Zhapu.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Council Declares Closing Yesterday; Most Proposals Passed According to Review Opinions; Fiercest Disputes Over Electricity and Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 21st] Today was the closing day of the Council. The entire day was spent discussing proposals, and the adjournment meeting was held two hours early to ensure that all 150 proposals could be fully discussed. Most were passed according to the review opinions. However, regarding proposal 693 from the Education Group concerning whether schools at all levels in the county could collect supplementary food fees or similar fees from students in the autumn of the 36th year, the councilors had differing opinions, with some advocating for allowing the collection and others opposing it. This sparked heated debate. Subsequently, the General Assembly resolved: (1) National schools should collect living subsidies ranging from 20,000 to 70,000 yuan. (2) County middle schools should handle it according to the county middle school's method, while county teachers' schools and county vocational schools should collect half. (3) City school miscellaneous fees should be increased to 44%, and the collection standards for private schools should be uniformly in accordance with the county schools, with the miscellaneous fee amount remaining at 20%. At this point, a temporary motion was made to request the cessation of excessive electricity fees and arbitrary price increases by the Suzhou Power Plant in June, which further intensified the atmosphere at the meeting, reaching another climax. Councilors unanimously condemned the situation, with voices rising one after another. Subsequently, the General Assembly decided on two principles: (1) The Council should send a letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting an explanation for the approval of the Suzhou Power Plant's price increase. (2) Councilors should be sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Beijing to investigate the content of the plant's request for a price increase, and to collect data on prices, coal consumption for electricity generation, and other information from power plants in Shanghai and Wuxi, conduct research, and then conduct on-site investigations of the internal situation of the Suzhou Power Plant to determine whether a price increase is warranted. The General Assembly held a closing ceremony at 7 p.m., bringing this once-a-month grand event to an end.</p>

<h3>Jiashen Loses Again in Second Match in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Air Dispatch] In the second match of the Shanghai Jiashen basketball team in Hong Kong, the opponent was the Zili team. Although the visiting team performed better than in the previous match, they were still unable to gain an advantage. As a result, they lost again by a score of 41 to 55.</p>
<p>Overall, the visiting team's skills were indeed lacking. The entire team lacked consistent tactics, and the offense and defense were naturally unable to be carried out cohesively. They also lacked experience, resulting in the first complete defeat of a visiting team in Hong Kong—most basketball teams visiting Hong Kong after the restoration had a predominantly winning record.</p>
<p>The visiting team has now gone to Guangzhou. The originally scheduled third match—against South China—had to be cancelled.</p>

<h3>Black Market for Gold and Foreign Currency: National Bank Decides to Intensify Crackdown; Informant Reward Not Subject to Financial Penalty Fine Details</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The amended Central Bank Management of Foreign Exchange Regulations has been promulgated and implemented. Regarding how to strengthen the crackdown on the black market for foreign currency in the future, and whether the reward for informants is not subject to the restriction of Article 5 of the Financial Penalty Reward Distribution Details, the reporter specifically inquired with relevant departments of the National Bank yesterday. It is said that the bank has not stopped cracking down on the black market for gold and foreign currency for even one day. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the amended Foreign Exchange Management Regulations, the crackdown on the black market for gold and foreign currency will be intensified. Those who illegally operate remittances from overseas Chinese will also be included. If discovered, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 32 of the amended Foreign Exchange Management Regulations: "In addition to confiscating their foreign exchange, the manager shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years." As for the reward for informants, the Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for rewarding informants of gold and foreign currency transactions, which were circulated for compliance before March of this year. The provision of Article 5 of the Financial Penalty Reward Distribution Details: "The reward given to the informant shall not exceed 30 million national currency per case per person, and the reward given to the personnel in charge of the case by the organizing agency shall not exceed 3 million national currency per case per person," was originally established for general tax penalties. The situation of cracking down on the black market for gold and foreign currency is special, and the Ministry of Finance has now agreed that the reward for informants can be exempted from the restriction of Article 5 of the Financial Penalty Reward Distribution Details. In addition, when asked about the recent tightening of credit in the market, they said that the government is currently urging the payment of the 35th year's direct tax, limiting the total tax revenue for the entire year to be paid in full before the end of August of this year. It is estimated that this tax revenue in Shanghai alone will reach 400 billion to 500 billion yuan this month, so it is expected that credit in the market will tighten recently.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Assists Our Country in Cracking Down on Smuggling and Eliminating the Black Market Exchange Rate; Memorandum of Agreement Signed by Representatives of Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to well-informed sources, our country and the Hong Kong government have repeatedly negotiated and discussed the problems of cracking down on smuggling of imports and exports in South China and eliminating the black market for foreign exchange and foreign currencies in Hong Kong. Finally, on August 15 of this year, a final agreement was reached, and a memorandum of agreement was formally exchanged in Hong Kong on that day. Our country was represented by Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, who was sent to Hong Kong for negotiations. The Hong Kong side was represented by Mr. Fuchs, Director of the Finance Department of the Hong Kong Government.</p>
<p>It is reported that the agreement contains detailed provisions on the method of settlement of export trade transshipped through Hong Kong from South China. That is, for export goods from South China that are transshipped to Hong Kong via Guangzhou, the exporter should first sell the export draft to the designated bank in Guangzhou at the Hong Kong dollar value. The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange is deposited in Hong Kong as a fund. The method of payment and use of the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange is stipulated in four points: (1) The Hong Kong government can use it for importing goods from foreign countries. (2) Our country can also use it for importing goods from foreign countries. (3) If there is still a balance after the payment and use of the fund for a certain period of time, it should be returned to our country. (4) The fund shall not be used for the import trade of third countries.</p>
<p>Based on the above agreement, the Hong Kong government decided to: (1) assist us in cracking down on smuggling in South China, and (2) assist us in eliminating the black market price of the national currency and the exchange rate of foreign exchange and foreign currencies in Hong Kong. It is said that the Hong Kong government showed great sincerity in the negotiation process. Because the lifeline of Hong Kong's economy is closely related to South China, it should seek close cooperation in all aspects. The Hong Kong government hopes that we will maintain its due and legitimate Sino-Hong Kong trade and not discriminate against it. As for all the articles of the agreement, it is said that they will be announced simultaneously by our government and the Hong Kong government on August 23. In order to thoroughly implement the provisions of the agreement, the existing relevant administrative agencies in Hong Kong must undergo a round of adjustments and preparations to ensure strict and thorough implementation after the agreement is announced. According to observations by an authoritative person, the signing of this agreement between our country and the Hong Kong government, coupled with the promulgation of the revised import and export trade and foreign exchange management methods in the country, will complement each other and solve the long-standing problems of smuggling in South China and the black market for foreign exchange in Hong Kong, which have lasted for nearly two years.</p>
<h3>Opinions Expressed by Importers and Exporters on the Disposal of Imported Goods</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Since the Import and Export Management Committee announced the measures for the disposal of imported goods that have arrived or have been shipped without obtaining a license, Zhang Yaozhang and other responsible persons of the Import and Export Chamber of Commerce in this city recently expressed the following opinions: Regarding the goods that have arrived at the port and have been shipped without obtaining an import license, the Import and Export Management Committee has recently announced two measures for handling them. All those shipped before August 16, 36th year, can register with the committee and wait for processing. This is very wise and seeks a solution to the suffering of merchants, but the disposal measures after registration still need to be announced separately. Otherwise, it is believed that the registered items should be given the convenience of customs clearance and extraction by merchants. Most of these items that have arrived and have been shipped were ordered before November 17 of last year. At that time, our country did not have the procedure for import licenses, so the payment for the goods was almost entirely paid. Foreign exporters or manufacturers cannot ignore the contract for delivery because our country promulgated this import license procedure, and they will definitely deliver the goods according to the contract. In addition, after the disposal of these registered goods, they cannot be purchased or shipped again without obtaining an import license after August 17 of this year. If such a situation occurs, we will definitely support the announcement measures and deal with them strictly. As of today, the official foreign exchange rate and the method of supplying the market foreign exchange rate have been clearly stipulated.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Slightly</h3>

All cases received before the application deadline of August 15 were completely reviewed. A total of 57 cases were reviewed before and after, totaling 36,486 bales of foreign cotton. Among them, more than 5,000 bales were applied for by importers and cotton merchants, and the remainder was applied for by the Textile Construction Company and private spinning mills. Each applicant is currently signing a transfer contract with the China Trust Bureau. However, a part of the above numbers arrived at the port later than the original stipulated date of April 30, and must be submitted to President Zhang for approval before they can be purchased. For all contracted cases, if the applicant is a spinning mill, the spinning mill will still spin on behalf of the China Trust Bureau, and the cotton yarn must be spun into cotton yarn or exchanged for fine cloth within one month to one and a half months. At the same time, the spinning mill will contact the Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau to negotiate export sales, in order to recover foreign exchange on a daily basis. As for the foreign cotton applied for by importers, the Textile Construction Company and the private spinning mills applying for spinning on behalf of the China Trust Bureau will spin on behalf of the China Trust Bureau according to the type and length of the foreign cotton, and the delivery for export will also be limited. In addition, among the more than 36,000 bales of foreign cotton that arrived at the port without a license and were purchased by the China Trust Bureau in this case, about 23,000 bales were US cotton, more than 8,000 bales were Indian cotton, more than 800 bales were Egyptian cotton, and more than 4,600 bales were cotton from Afghanistan, Brazil, Mexico, and Africa.</p>
<h3>Tea Export Association Held a Board of Directors Meeting Yesterday, Deciding to Present the Difficulties of Export Sales to the Government</h3>
<p>The Tea Export Association held a full board of directors meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Sun Xiaocun, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, and others attended. Tang Jisan chaired the meeting. The focus of the discussion was on selecting representatives to go to the capital to present the actual difficulties of tea and the remedial measures to be taken after the implementation of the new foreign exchange management method.</p>
<p>As a result, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Ye Shichang, Hong Jingwu, Zai Zhenhuan, Han Junheng, Song Qichi, Tao Zhensheng, Ning Weiting, Zhu Yanqing, Wu Juenong, Sun Xiaocun, Chen Zhongming, and Wang Xiangchen were selected as representatives. They are scheduled to go to the capital by night train on the 24th to clarify everything to the competent authorities and ask them to adjust the purchase price to compensate for it.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the association, the government authorities are implementing the new foreign exchange management method with great determination this time, which is an effective plan to adapt to reality and save our country's export trade crisis. Therefore, Chinese and foreign tea merchants have expressed unanimous support, and they will actively promote and accomplish the task from now on, and will never allow the price of exported boxed tea to rise sharply. The issue of how to stabilize the prices of last year's and this year's boxed tea sales has also been discussed repeatedly, and specific plans will be proposed to the government soon.</p>
<h3>Rayon Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of rayon fell sharply as soon as it opened because the allocated goods had to be shipped out. Number 120 of Takayama Yukari first called 25.2 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 5 million yuan. The futures price was called 4 million yuan for delivery in seven days. In the afternoon, the final selling price was 5.3 million yuan, which was 1.1 million yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>
<p>The market continued to be tired yesterday. The price of grade C silk was 30 million yuan, and the price of high-quality grade C silk was also traded at 30.07 million yuan. Five bales of grade E silk were traded at a price of 29 million yuan, and the payment was made in seven days. 28-minute dry warp had an order of five dan heads, and the asking price was 19.5 million yuan. The Indian firm had a slight interest in taking it in, but the counter-offer of 8 million yuan was not successful. The price of 30-minute single-dan open goods was slightly shorter yesterday.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of real silk quilts fell by 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Huagang goods hovered between 11.1345 million yuan for a long time after the market opened. The largest call was 180,000 yuan. Until near the close, because there were many retail sales, the price fell. In an instant, it fell within 100,000 yuan, and finally closed at 1.02 million yuan for the spot price and 1.05 million yuan for the deferred price. Dachen goods were only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan more expensive than Huagang goods. The closing price for deferred was 100,000 yuan, and the original price of checkered fabric, made of 37,000 yuan, remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Benchmark Price of US Dollar Reduced by 500 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee approved the benchmark price of 39,000 yuan for the spot US dollar settlement on the 18th, the designated banks have followed this benchmark price to trade foreign exchange in the past few days. As a result, most of the settlements were for exports, and settlements for imports were less, so almost all banks formed a situation of oversupply. Therefore, the revised settlement method has achieved initial results. Therefore, yesterday, the Stabilization Committee observed the actual market situation and reduced the settlement benchmark price of Tianhui to 38,500 yuan, which was 500 yuan lower than before. Calculated according to this ratio, the buying and selling prices of spot US dollars by designated banks were also reduced yesterday, with the buying price being 38,000 yuan and the selling price being 39,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Not Changed for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Pricing Subcommittee of the Textile Adjustment Conference decided at yesterday's meeting to maintain the original price of the negotiated price of each yarn and not adjust it.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Actual sales were sparse yesterday. The market continued to be tired in the afternoon. Finally, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 200,000 yuan compared to last month, to 16.7 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns were also reduced by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan to 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Fabric</p>
<p>The opening was strong yesterday, but near the noon close, large households dumped their goods, and the fabric market suddenly became tired. Finally, the price of Longtou fine cloth was 450,000 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Blue Chicken Colored Ball was also good for 5,000 yuan, and Wufu Yanghe Zhenzhong and 20-count extra fine cloth continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. There were some increases and decreases in the remaining bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth, raw cloth, and blue cloth, and Shilin cloth.</p>

<h3>Dreadful Uterine Cancer</h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>Cancer is a malignant tumor for which there is currently no radical cure. Therefore, when European and American women hear a doctor's diagnosis of cancer, it is as if their death sentence has been announced, and as a result, they have a sense of vigilance about cancer. Our Chinese people do not have much knowledge of cancer, and some simply do not even understand the name of cancer, so it is such a pity and how sad when they miss the treatment period! I encountered such a fact last month: Last year, a middle-aged woman brought her child to see a doctor, and she took the opportunity to talk about her mother, who is now over fifty years old and has not been feeling well recently. Her menstruation has not stopped yet. Is her poor health caused by excessive menstruation? She asked me this question; I then asked her, "Is there a lot of vaginal discharge?" She replied, "Nine out of ten women have vaginal discharge, so there is always some." I told her that a woman's menstrual period should stop after the age of fifty. If there is still vaginal discharge, she should ask a doctor to check for cancer, as cancer is a terrible disease that should be discovered and treated early, otherwise, it will be too late to regret! She simply listened to my advice and left. This year, she came to see me herself and talked about her mother, regretting not listening to my advice. She has now been sent to the hospital, and the doctor told her that she has uterine cancer, and the condition is already advanced, making surgery hopeless. They can only use radium treatments. After hearing this, I felt that the need to popularize medical knowledge is still a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>(1) Why is cancer so terrible? As mentioned above, cancer is a malignant tumor. What is the difference between a malignant tumor and a benign tumor? I will describe them separately below.</p>
<p>A. Benign tumors have a membrane surrounding them. Even if the tumor grows, it has a clear boundary with other tissues and does not invade them. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, have a destructive proliferative ability. Their periphery has no boundary, and they develop around the surrounding tissues as much as possible, using destructive means. Not only are soft tissues destroyed by them, but even hard bones are eroded by them.</p>
<p>B. Benign tumors, when they occur in a certain organ, stop there and do not spread from organ A to organ B. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, have cells that can transfer from organ A to a nearby organ B, or even to a distant organ C, through blood or lymph fluid, and the same malignant tumor can occur.</p>
<p>C. Benign tumors are completely removed after surgery. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, often recur after incomplete surgery if there are still tumor buds lurking in the nearby healthy tissues.</p>
<p>D. Benign tumors do not affect the entire human body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, can make patients look haggard, emaciated, and suffer unbearably, appearing near death. This is called "cachexia" in medicine.</p>
<p>(2) Symptoms of uterine cancer: Uterine cancer mostly occurs in women over forty to fifty years old, especially those who have had multiple births. The symptoms of this disease are, first, excessive menstruation or irregular uterine bleeding (bleeding with a certain cycle is called menstruation, but if it occurs every ten or twenty days, it is not menstruation, but uterine bleeding). Most women think it is just a disturbance when menstruation is about to stop and do not pay attention. Second, vaginal discharge. In the early stages, the amount of vaginal discharge is not very large and has a slight odor. Later, the vaginal discharge is profuse and has a terrible odor, but in the early stages, people do not pay attention to it because of the saying "nine out of ten women have vaginal discharge". Third, pain. In the early stages of cancer, it only invades the uterus itself, and most people do not feel any pain. When it invades nearby organs, such as the peritoneum, bladder, rectum, and connective tissue around the uterus, the patient feels pain. Feeling pain indicates that the disease is expanding. Fourth, in the early stages of cancer, due to the toxins of the cancer, libido decreases. In the late stages, the overall condition deteriorates further, the patient becomes emaciated and haggard, and develops the characteristic cachexia of cancer. If there is a mixed infection, fever and chills will also occur, and the patient's death sentence is imminent.</p>
<p>(3) Is there absolutely no hope for uterine cancer? That is not necessarily the case. If you can go to a doctor for examination in the early stages, that is, when women in their forties and fifties have excessive menstruation, profuse vaginal discharge, or local abnormalities, and the examination results show that cancer is suspected, then a tissue examination should be performed, taking a suspicious part of the tissue for microscopic examination. If cancer is confirmed, surgery should be used to completely remove the uterus, and then X-ray and radium irradiation should be performed to prevent recurrence. Therefore, cancer is not without hope. If the surgical period is missed, that is, if the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissues, causing pain day and night, and the patient looks haggard, even if the patient requests surgery, the doctor can only stand by and do nothing. Early diagnosis of cancer patients is a great blessing for cancer patients, but the lack of medical knowledge among the Chinese people and the sense of shame among women cause the best surgical period to be delayed and missed. What a pity!</p>
<h3>Preface to the Collected Medical Essays of Fan</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Looking around, one can clearly see the current situation of China and its social environment: the situation twenty years ago is barely improved today, twenty years later. The "problem of traditional Chinese medicine" from twenty years ago remains unsolved today. Although some progressive elements in the traditional Chinese medicine community and progressive people in society deeply feel that traditional Chinese medicine cannot survive independently and have a tendency and fashion of approaching science and studying new medicine, the conservative elements among them still account for the majority. They are still actively reversing course, running against the tide of the times, and still clinging to the theory of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, regarding Yin and Yang and the Five Elements as the "science" of traditional Chinese medicine. The general public is still very indifferent to medical issues and has very little correct understanding of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals. The majority of the people still have an abnormal lack of medical and hygiene knowledge, and their lack of attention to their own health issues remains the same. The epidemic of infectious diseases continues to occur every year, regardless of urban or rural areas, without achieving the goal of containment. In short, everything, everything, the past twenty years seem to have passed in vain, with no significant signs of progress. Isn't this mirror of the real society clearly placed before your eyes?</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the lack of progress: the political inability to unify and the years of internal warfare have made it impossible to build the country, stabilize people's livelihoods, and engage in production. This is the major reason that hinders the progress of all social culture. It is also the major reason that hinders the progress of medical culture. Medical culture is originally a part of social culture. Its development and progress must have its material conditions - economic foundation. For the past twenty years, the country has suffered from long-term internal warfare and the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. It goes without saying that there have been financial difficulties – a weak economic foundation. The authorities have adopted a nominalistic attitude towards medical construction and hygiene facilities, dealing with them perfunctorily; as for medical policies, they both want to follow the trend and believe in science, and yet they hesitate with metaphysics and refuse to let go, greatly reversing course. Opinions diverge and attitudes are ambiguous. As a result, people in the government and the public do not know what to do, making fools of themselves everywhere, a shame for the country, which those with knowledge regret and grieve! The eight-year War of Resistance ended in victory. The people hoped that China's national destiny, although it could not reach the sky in one step, could at least be expected to seize this good opportunity to enter peaceful unification, cooperate in building the country, and gradually complete a modernized democratic country; and that the shameful names of internal warfare and division would never again be seen in black and white. However, contrary to expectations, the flames of internal warfare, following the divergence of political views and the failure of negotiations, reappeared on the land; in the two years after the victory, the situation has greatly intensified, without any signs of stopping. In this way, with political inability to achieve peaceful unification and people's livelihoods unable to be stabilized, how can we devote ourselves to construction and strive for production? Therefore, all social and cultural construction undertakings are in a state of stagnation and paralysis, and the medical and cultural undertakings, needless to say, are similarly unable to be promoted and developed. These are all the actual reasons that have caused China's medical culture to have little progress for decades.</p>
<p>It is precisely because in such a Chinese society that has gone through decades of long years and still sees no progress, that the writings I have written over the years still have value for publication, and these old records of clichés still have the necessity to be retransmitted and repeatedly played. The target audience for my writing these chapters was the immature society at that time, and now that I have collected these writings and published them to the world, the target audience is still the immature society before my eyes. With the society showing no progress from one day to the next, my writings seem not to have died and are still living writings. Therefore, when I publish this book, my heart is truly filled with a sense of laughter and tears!</p>
<p>When will there be a time when my childish remarks and shallow writings are no longer needed? This depends on the speed of progress in our Chinese society.</p>
<p>When Chinese society reaches a new stage of progress, that is, when people in society and the general public feel that the remarks and writings in my collection are childish and shallow, that will be the greatest purpose and highest wish of my writing these writings for nearly twenty years. I hope that my greatest purpose and highest wish can be achieved soon! Because this wish, this purpose, is also the common purpose of all the Chinese people, the common wish of all the people!</p>
<p>Junqing's note: Doctor Fan Shouyuan, as a Shanghai Municipal Councilor in this session, has been working very hard in social movements in medical affairs for many years and has long been renowned in Shanghai. He has now been recommended by the directors of the Doctors' Association as a candidate for the National Assembly representative in the medical field. In the future, his great achievements will surely be a unique highlight in our medical community. The "Collected Medical Essays of Fan" mentioned in this article is his work of the past twenty years, which is the crystallization of his efforts in "social movements in medical affairs". Now that the country is beginning to build, there is an urgent need for talent. In addition to admiring Mr. Fan, I am happy to introduce it as above. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Random Chats After Diagnosis (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wu Jihua</p>
<p>Anleuron is not the most advanced preparation among male hormones. Its position is between testicular extract and pure testicular hormone. Simply put, it is a testicular preparation that has been tested for potency by biological assays. Compared with crude testicular extract and preparations such as Spohlin, it is certainly superior, but compared with the most advanced pure testicular hormones in modern times, it is still far behind and can only be regarded as an outdated product. Although Anleuron has been tested for potency by comb assay, each cc contains two comb units, but its solution still contains many impurities, so prolonged storage often results in reddish-yellow granular precipitates and gradually reduces its therapeutic value. Most of the Anleuron purchased on the black market today is about ten years old. The efficacy of this stale old product is far less than that of the fresh product, but the price is so high. Isn't it a great injustice to pay the highest price and buy second-rate goods? Assuming you like to use natural testicular hormones, you may wish to switch to various products made by American manufacturers, such as Virosterone "Endo", which contains three or five comb units per ampoule of 1 cc, and only sells for 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Wouldn't it be more economical, and according to my trial use, the effect is similar to Anleuron. Or you can switch to Swiss-made Androstin to get a similar effect.</p>
<p>Padutin is a circulatory stimulant extracted from the pancreas. Its function is to inhibit vasospasm and dilate blood vessels on the surface of the body and the coronary arteries in the heart. Its indications are vasospasm, acrocyanosis, intermittent claudication, Raynaud's gangrene, obliterative endarteritis, trophic ulcers, gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers, essential hypertension and angina pectoris, etc. It is commonly used for hypertension, using its ability to dilate surface blood vessels to lower blood pressure. Because Padutin is a stimulant, it is the same as general stimulants, its efficacy is easily lost and it must be used continuously; according to the prescribed dosage, initially inject half an ampoule once a day, and after three days, inject one ampoule twice a day. If the effect weakens, the dosage must be increased to two ampoules twice a day or even higher. Calculated at the current price of 550,000 yuan per ampoule, the patient will have to spend about 12.65 million yuan on medicine in ten days, which is shocking. And after spending such a high price, can it really cure hypertension? This is not possible, absolutely not possible. Because the pathogenesis of essential hypertension is very complex, and no consistent conclusion has been reached so far, although there are many treatment methods, the results are not satisfactory. Preparations that relax blood vessels and relieve vasospasm, such as Padutin, are only drugs that temporarily lower blood pressure. Assuming the patient does not know how to maintain health or the number of injections is too few, the blood pressure will slowly rise and may return to its original position. According to my experience, resting the body and mind is the most effective way to treat hypertension. If you can abandon strenuous work and live at home quietly without asking about world affairs, take a nap for two or three hours every afternoon, supplemented by regulating your diet, quitting smoking and alcohol, and applying iodine preparations (potassium iodide is the most economical) and sedatives, then the blood pressure will naturally gradually decrease and not easily rebound. If drugs that relax blood vessels are necessary, it seems appropriate to take preparations such as Acetylcholine (Roche products, only 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per box of six ampoules), which have similar effects but are far less expensive. If you worship idols and go to great lengths to seek Padutin, you are really what Shanghai people call the number one big fool.</p>
<p>Dolantin is a pain reliever and antispasmodic drug, commonly used as a substitute for morphine to avoid the side effects of morphine. There are many types of painkillers besides morphine, why must you use Dolantin? If it is used as an antispasmodic, you can take German-made Octinum instead, which has more or less the same effect and is much cheaper (Swiss-made Octinum is even cheaper), or you can switch to the raw material Extract Belladonna Atropin, which is even more economical. In short, Dolantin can be replaced by other drugs and achieve the same effect, so why seek this expensive product? A female patient named Zhou came to my clinic the other day and I bought her a tube of Dolantin tablets. It is said that taking it can stimulate the mind, cause pleasure, and suppress dizziness and heaviness. I replied to her that this medicine should not be worth tens of thousands of yuan, and I was unwilling to buy it for you, so I gave her a few small pieces of Phenobar-bital 1/2gr and told her to try it. Three days later, she said that the effect was very good and she wanted to buy a little more. In short, the Dolantin business was broken by me.</p>

<h3>The Small Village</h3>
<p>— By E. Zola, Translated by Bi Xiushao</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Where is the small village? In what rugged fold does it hide its many white houses? Are these white houses gathered in the depths of a hollow around the church? Or do they stand in a row along the main road, with a cheerful appearance? Or do they, like mischievous goats, climb up a ridge, overlapping layer upon layer of red, or half-hiding in the green?</p>
<p>Does the small village have a pleasant name? A gentle name that is easy for the French tongue to pronounce? Or is it spelled with many German consonants, sounding very stiff, almost like the croaking of a crow?</p>
<p>In this small village, do people harvest wheat or pick grapes? Is it a wheat-producing land or a grape-growing region? At this time, what are the residents doing on the sun-drenched land? In the evening, returning along the country lanes, do they also stop to look at the vast harvest and give thanks to God for this blessed year?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>I am happy to imagine it on a low hill. It stands there, so hidden beneath the dense woods that, from a distance, it looks like a collapsed rock covered with emerald moss. But smoke rises from the branches; down the sloping path, many children are pushing carts. Thus, from the plain, everyone gazes at it with envious admiration; people pass by, with the memory of this half-revealed nest in their minds.</p>
<p>No, I would rather believe it is in a corner of the plain, beside a beautiful stream. Its extent is so small that a row of poplar trees like a curtain can shield it from everyone's eyes. Its thatched cottages, like chaste bathing women, disappear into the willow groves along the riverbank. A verdant pasture serves as a carpet; a hawthorn hedge surrounds it everywhere, making it a large garden. People pass by it, but cannot see it. The sound of the washerwomen echoes, almost like the singing of white-cheeked birds. Not a wisp of smoke. It sleeps peacefully in the depths of its green bed.</p>
<p>None of us know it. The neighboring cities barely know of its existence; it is so small that not a single geographer has noticed it. It is almost uninhabited. Its name evokes no memories. Among the many famous and well-known cities, it is a humble village without history, without glory, without shame, vanishing into a corner.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this that it smiles so gently, this lovely little village! Its residents live in the secluded wilderness; many children roll on the riverbank, and women come and go under the shade of the trees. It, on the other hand, is very happy, living a hidden life filled with paradise-like joy. It is so far from the mire and noise of the big cities! Its sunlight is enough for it to enjoy; its happiness is created by its silence, its restraint, and the poplar trees like a curtain that shield it from the entire world.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the whole world may know of this village's existence.</p>
<p>Ah! A disaster from the sky—the stream will be dyed red with blood, the poplar trees like a curtain will be flattened by cannonballs, the destroyed thatched cottages will point out the silent disappointment of each family, and the small village will become famous as a result.</p>
<p>There will be no more songs of the washerwomen, no more children rolling on the riverbank, no more harvests, no more silence and humble happiness. Victory or defeat, one more new place name in history, one more new page of blood, one more tragic new corner irrigated by the blood of our youth.</p>
<p>It smiles, it sleeps, it does not know that it will lend its name to a great massacre. Tomorrow, it will sob, its dying breath echoing throughout Europe. Then, it will remain on the ground like a speck of blood. It, which was so happy and gentle yesterday, is now shrouded in tragic darkness. It will see pale-faced visitors passing before it, as people pass before the floor of a morgue. It will be cursed from then on.</p>
<p>We, if it is Austerlitz or Magenta (1), we will hear it echo in our hearts with the sound of victory. If it is Waterloo, our memories will have tragic echoes, like the sound of drums covered in black gauze, leading the funeral of the entire nation.</p>
<p>It must miss its quiet riverbank, its ignorant farmers, its secluded corner—so far from mankind that only the swallows that return every spring know of its existence! Already defiled, it will shamefully live forever in future centuries with its sky filled with the flight of crows, its land reeking of corpses, like a dangerous place of murder and robbery, forever remaining a terrible ancient battlefield where two nations slaughtered each other.</p>
<p>A nest of love, a peaceful paradise, this small village will henceforth become a vast cemetery, a public burial ground, where even weeping mothers cannot come to lay their gardens.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>France scatters these distant cemeteries all over the world. In any corner of Europe, we can kneel down and pray. Our resting cemeteries are not just Père Lachaise, Montmartre, or Montparnasse; they also have the names of all our victories and defeats. Under the heavens, from China to Mexico, from the snowy lands of Russia to the yellow sands of Egypt, there is not a corner of land that does not sleep a murdered Frenchman.</p>
<p>Many silent and desolate cemeteries sleep heavily in the peace of the vast countryside. Most, almost all, are found at the foot of destroyed villages, their collapsed walls still filled with terrifying sights. Waterloo is just a farm, Magenta has only fifty or so houses. A terrifying evil wind blows on these tiny villages, their syllables, which the day before were innocent, are henceforth stained with such a large taste of blood and the smell of gunpowder that mankind will forever tremble when they smell it.</p>
<p>Pensively, I gaze at a map of the war zone. Following the banks of the Rhine, I inquire about the plains and mountains. Is the small village on the left side of the river or on the right side of the river? Should I look for it near a strategic position? Or should I find its location further away, somewhere in the vast wilderness?</p>
<p>Then, I close my eyes, unable to imagine this peaceful village, the poplar trees like a curtain hanging in front of the whole pile of white houses, this verdant field where many swallows fly over, this end of the meadow, this song of the washerwomen, this virgin land that will be raped by war, its horizon defiled by the sound of military bugles.</p>
<p>This small village, where is it actually located? (2)</p>

<h3>After Bathing</h3>
<p>— Robert</p>
<p>Robert (1886-) is a Swiss painter famous in Paris. Thirty years ago, he waved the flag and shouted along with the Cubist movement. But in the past decade, he has been engaged in studying the classics and creating Neo-Classicism.</p>
<p>His works are mostly figures, with complex compositions and rich decorative meaning; the colors are bright and elegant, the tones are delicate, and the style is generally close to Ingres. Unfortunately, he is naturally lazy and has very few works. He is now sixty-one years old, and his entire body of oil paintings is still less than a hundred. Many of his sketches are also unfinished. This work can be called representative. (Liu Shi)</p>

<p>One</p>
<p>At dusk, the first big star appeared on the horizon. I gently closed the gauze window and asked them to tell their wishes.</p>
<p>One said, "I have no wishes."</p>
<p>Another said, "I have too many wishes to tell."</p>
<p>Another said, "I only have one wish. May God forgive me for not having great compassion and a spirit of universal love. I only faithfully pray that all the people I love and all the people I hate will be healthy, safe, and live well. Don't let them die, because if there is a long future, I will deeply love and bitterly hate. As for others, I can't care about them."</p>
<p>The other two shook their heads and cried, "This selfish person with the heart of a wolf!"</p>
<p>Yet, I don't know why, I seemed willing to forgive her ruthlessness. Perhaps her lack of universal love and compassion is wrong, but I was surprisingly pleased with this free and frank wish.</p>
<p>Without fierce hate, how can there be ardent love? Isn't it because of its thorns that we love the rose branches, making them appear so touchingly beautiful?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>"Dear friends," I asked, "if there were magical shoes in fairy tales, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"Wearing them, I would walk into the past," the round-faced girl, still with childlike innocence, blurted out, "to appreciate my adorable childhood again, and the childhoods of my father and mother, the childhoods of my grandfather and grandmother..."</p>
<p>"What a faithful slave to memories! Do you really believe that the 'future' is certainly better than the 'past'? My sweet little fool! If those magical shoes could also walk on the path of time, I would go forward, forward, to see the unknown and beautiful future, never looking back." These words were spoken by a lady with a strong personality.</p>
<p>The third person said, "Why are you just wandering on the path of time? I wouldn't. Dear, if I had a pair of magical shoes, I would wear them to the island where Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up, lives, to listen to his stories and the jade-like voices of the fairies. There are flowers as red as fire there, and there are four springs there—"</p>
<p>"There," the last person interjected, "do you know what kind of place it is?"</p>
<p>"I know, it's an island."</p>
<p>"Indeed, the name of that island is 'Neverland'," came the cold reply.</p>
<p>"Oh, 'Neverland'," a faint sigh, followed by the question, "Then what about you? What is the place you want to go to?"</p>
<p>"A place that is not magical, nor hard to find, perhaps not even needing magical shoes. It is the land of mankind, peaceful, safe, tranquil, without the terrible things of bloodshed and killing. Every child has a happy childhood, every old person has a comfortable old age, every person has a beautiful youth. There is no theft there, and no one goes hungry."</p>
<p>"That's not Neverland?"</p>
<p>"No." Shaking her head.</p>
<p>"That's not a memory of the past?"</p>
<p>"No." Stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Nor is it a dream of the imagined future?"</p>
<p>"No." Even more stubbornly.</p>
<p>"But where is it then? Searching high and low, everywhere is vague and unseen, perhaps it is even more eternally nonexistent than 'Neverland'."</p>
<p>"The place is not hard to find, and there is no need to search high and low. It is the land of mankind, which we all know—paradise is not far away, but only in a thought, the thought of countless people, isn't that like a pair of magical shoes?"</p>

<h3>The Shen Bao Newspaper and Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital Jointly Offer Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth</h3>
<p>Applications from poor women in the Zhabei district can be made in advance starting September 1st</p>
<p>This newspaper collaborated with Renhe Hospital at 36 Xiangshan Road to offer assistance for poor women in childbirth. The first phase of six months has expired, and the second phase is now beginning. It has been deeply praised by society, and people from all walks of life have continuously donated to jointly support this righteous cause, which is truly admirable! Now, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital at 909 Tanggu Road (intersection of North Fujian Road), upholding the aim of serving society by relieving the poor and sick, has added free beds to receive impoverished mothers and is willing to cooperate with this newspaper to offer "Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth." It has been decided to begin this service on September 1st. Any impoverished mothers in the Zhabei district can fill out an application form at the Social Service Department of this newspaper one month before delivery. After approval, they can be admitted to the hospital for childbirth at the due time. Except for the cost of meals during the hospitalization period, which is the responsibility of the mother, all other hospitalization fees, delivery fees, medical fees, and examination fees will be waived. For the extremely poor, meal costs will also be waived. Recently, several applications for childbirth assistance have been received daily. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively donate so that this righteous cause can continue unabated, be promoted and developed, and truly benefit society in no small measure.</p>
