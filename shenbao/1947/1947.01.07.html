<h3>馬特使將返國述職　昨分晤主席及司徒大使　來華與否抵美後可決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕馬特使重感冒已愈，六日上午十一時半往訪司使共進午餐，餐後並作長炎，下午五時半再訪蔣主席，談半小時辭出。據一般觀察，張治中五日訪馬使在前，六日馬使訪司使及謁主席在後，此中眞象不難揣測。又南開校長張伯苓，六日晨曾訪司徒大使晤談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕聯合社華盛頓電稱，馬特使近將返美一行，向杜魯門總統及國務卿貝爾納斯報告中國情形，馬使返美後，是否將再來華，須俟三人會晤後再定，記者爲此特訪美使館發言人康納斯，詢是否確實，據稱：「尙無所悉」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美國駐華特使馬歇爾，如無意外發展，將立即回國，向杜魯門總統及國務卿貝爾納斯述職。馬使是否即此結束其十三個月之外交使命，抑仍將返華，對調解國共之爭，出以新努力，繫於返國會商結果。局勢是否尙有可爲，尤須馬使自身決定。惟華盛頓多數消息靈通人士以爲，馬使返華之成份較少。果爾則將引起朱來之美國駐華大使問題，因外交界相信，馬使退休後，其親密之同僚司徒雷登大使亦將辭職。此外，馬使返國後另有其他兩種可能發展：（一）政界觀察家預料，一俟馬使有久居國內之徵兆，則其鼎鼎大名將成爲一九四八年總統候選人之談話資料。（二）馬使返國休養，其友人相信此一六十六歲之軍人外交家，將退隱浮吉尼亞州農塲，但官方預料，杜魯門仍將使其留居要職。關於此層，官塲方面曾論及馬帥代替李希海軍上將出任總統參軍長之可能。李希年已七十一歲，自戰爭初期以來，即任斯職，今後或將退休，或就外交職務。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷震來滬後，奔走極忙，五日晚曾與張君勵長談，張氏並介紹民社黨各中常委與雷氏相見。據民社黨宣傳部長徐傅霖氏稱：雷張兩氏會晤，僅爲交換意見，並無任何決定。民社黨內部對是否加入政府一點，意見仍未一致，徐氏指報載民社黨若干人士對參加政府事所發表之談話均爲「個人意見」，因黨的熊度始終尙未決定，徐氏曾的晤吳鐵城氏，因吳氏有病未果。此間一般人咸以爲，民社黨內部，於決定參加國大時已呈意見分歧之象，此次對政府改組之爭執，似益較前次嚴重，頗有引起分裂之可能。</p>
<h3>總預算全部審畢　參會駐委會彙編報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕參政會駐委會六日上午九時舉行第五次臨時會，出席傅斯年等二十餘人，首由政院會計長胡善恒列席報吿接收敵僞物資概况及收入數字，預算爲八千億，但目前尙有賸餘房屋無法售出（如上海百老匯大樓等），常有尹述賢等提出詢問，謂預算數額內未列　餘物品詳細數量，究竟賸餘何種物資，應予列入，胡答，賸餘者均爲地皮及房屋，由出席者相繼提出接收物資之之弊病問題甚多。繼由經濟部長王雲五報吿中紡公司預算情形，盼本年度增加收入，力謀增加生產，本年預算收人爲四千億，如能增產，即可盈利，惟必需與財政政策相配合。續由參政員提出質問，對花紗布之管制及黑市問題始終未予改善，頗表不滿，並對美軍賸餘物資問題有所討論。末對第一組審查意見修正通過，下午三時繼續開會，討論第二，第三兩組審查意見，至六時許始散，全部預算審議完舉，即將彙編一詳盡之審議報吿。</p>
<h3>民盟二中全會</h3>
<p>選張瀾等爲主席團</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟第一屆二中全會，六日上午開幕，出席者有張瀾，張東蓀，沈鈞儒，章伯鈞，黃炎培，羅隆基，張申府，史良，周鯨文，柳亞子，鮮英，葉篤義，劉王立明，鄧初民，楚圖南，周新民等三十餘人。並選出張瀾，張東蓀，沈鈞儒，章伯鈞，黃炎培，羅隆基，史良，張申府，鄧初民爲主席團。上午由黃炎培任主席，當由民盟各部負責人周新民，章伯鈞，羅隆基，沈鈞儒等提出工作報吿。下午由沈鈞儒主席，由民盟各地支部代表提出報吿，並通過決議二項：（一）紀念死難盟員，搜集遺著，刊行專集，籌建紀念堂。（二）對死難盟員家屬致敬，並予撫恤。張瀾於開幕禮　曾致詞，其要點如次：（一）民盟對政治制度，主張普選制度的議會制，且主張兩院制。對國家最高行政機構，則採內閣制。民盟主張應實行憲政，勵行法治，但不承認有了憲法就算憲政，故主張任何人或任何政黨，不得處於超法律的地位。（二）民盟今後努力目標有二，一爲迎取同情，二爲加强組織。（三）盟員必須把握自己的獨立性，不能隨便拋了自己的主張，而隨聲附和，不可爲一時苟且，而忽略長久遠大之圖。</p>
<h3>國大結束事務　商定三項辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕國大秘書處以結束期迫，六日下午三時舉行工作會報，由洪秘書長蘭友主席，檢討過去一切工作，並會商各項結束事務，常決定：（一）特殊努力工作人員，應分別獎勵。（二）除會計總務辦理結束事務外，其餘各單位事務，一律於十五日結束。（三）各單位將各種辦法規定資料圖表等，作有系統之彙編。存檔，以備將來參閱。</p>
<h3>趙琛談雷啓霖案　京高院有權受理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕首都高院院長趙琛，六日語本報記者，關於寗夏國大代表雷啓霖被捕後，向高院請求轉移管轄一事，本日已批令逕向該院檢察處呈請核辦。趙氏稱：雷案之「犯罪」地，起訴地，雖均爲寗夏，惟被訴人則在南京，其被控「罪」名爲「內亂嫌疑」、依法應以高院爲第一審法庭，爲求審判公允，自宜轉移管轄，首都高院有權受理此案，但此「內亂嫌疑」案尙未經偵查程序，故應由高檢處先予處理。</p>
<h3>蔣經國飛青</h3>
<p>阿合買提江同機前往</p>
<p>〔本報天津六日電〕蔣經國六日晨九時半專機過津飛靑，新疆國大代表阿合買提江一行隨機飛去。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島六日電〕新疆省副主席阿合買提江一行，六日午由津乘美齡號機抵靑，下榻迎賓館，午後遊覽市區，參觀水族館等，晚間市府舉行鷄尾酒會，招待參觀各工廠及中紡公司。</p>

<h3>兩民航公司迭次失事　交部決着手整頓　召集有關方面開始澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕交部因民航機迭次出事，事態嚴重，自六日起已令兩航空公司停航一週，幷定六日在部召集兩公司總經理及機航組主任等集會，籌商整頓事宜。交部主管人員，屆時亦將出席。頃悉，因氣候惡劣，兩公司人員昨未能乘機來京，改乘夜車離滬七日來京，已改七日召開此項會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕兩民航公司自七日起除郵件仍照常飛航外，客票悉遵令停售。中航央航兩總經理沈德燮，陳卓林，定七日自滬來京與交部會商善後各事。聞將對兩公司所有民航機機件及機塲設備等，將澈底予以檢查整理，藉保安全。</p>
<h3>民航局將重訂　起飛氣候標凖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因氣候不良及飛行設備之不充分，過去十二日之內，已有客機四架慘遭不幸，總計遇難之搭客及機上工作人員已達一百十三人。在民航業正待發展之際，連續發生意外，誠至不幸。前晚失事之班機，爲AC-46型之中國航空公司一二一號客機，該機係五日上午五時十分離滬飛平，全程預定五小時飛畢。但該機於離滬二小時半，本擬降落於青島美海軍陸戰隊之海濱飛機塲，結果因氣候惡劣，視綫不淸，竟至觸山焚毀。該機失事後，中國公司立派兩機至出事地點搜索，現已知其中駕駛員之一爲克樂格氏，搜索結果，立即報吿靑島方面，謂此機已損毀甚大，未見有生存之搭客，此時中國航空公司靑島辦事處當即組織救護隊，冒險進入失事所在地之中共控制區，於淸晨發現該機殘骸，乘客及機中人員已全部死難。按靑島海濱機塲有雷達設備，該機塲由美海軍陸戰隊航空隊使用，對於聯絡設備之完善，爲全國各機塲所罕有，但該機竟未與地面雷達取得聯絡，終致在地面視綫僅八百呎之氣候下，觸山焚毀，亦云慘矣！</p>
<p>中國航空公司總經理沈德燮，美籍董事杜偉德Tweedy，營業主任高大經，本於昨日奉召赴京，惟於晨間赴機塲時，因氣候惡劣，宋能成行。該公司昨日曾擬派專機赴靑趕辦善後事宜，亦因氣候關係未果。</p>
<p>據悉：交部聞悉此事後，頗爲標準，以增進今後旅客之安全。停飛令實施後，根據交通部之統計，將有民航機七十七架停航，其中屬於中國航空公司者有四十架（C-47，DC-3，C-53型廿三架，C-46二十架，DC-4，六架），屬於中央航空公司者共廿八架（C-47,DC-3,C-53，型十六架架，C-46十二架），兩公司每日出動之機數約為三十架。據民用航空局長戴安國表示：停航期內，將重行規定起飛氣候標準，上海機塲之起飛氣候標準尙稱滿意，但青島·北平·廣州等地，須加重訂。同時專家將在此期間會同兩公司負責人審查各該公司設備，必要時交部亦將派員參加。</p>
<h3>遇難人員　名單發表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司一二一號滬平班機失事後，遇難乘客共三十九人，全部名單如下：李潤紳（男），山東省國大代表。翁麗生（女），蔣逖先（男），李松亭（男），楊文獻（男），張世德（男），李子固（男），趙潛夫（男），李幼雲（男）張廷三（男），愛契生（Johli　Etohison）（聯總美籍男職員）秦秉常（男），陳文鈞（男），李聘之（男）（天津國大代表），傅秀山（男）（天津國大代表），梁世衡（男），洛期（男）（James　J．Ross）英商，蔣殿榮（男），王志亭（男），牟震東（男），李世芳（男），趙占一（男），言韋叙（男），張如彥（男）（大公報編輯），李民憲（男），張豪爲（男），徐錫榮（男）劉懷義（男），張輔仁（男），甘妮里絲（Sister　Mary　Gariglis）（女意籍），西塞爾（Sister　Elizabeth　Cecile）（女美籍），周古初（男），趙永絡（男），荆老太太（女），荆小虎（男），蔣淑源（女），周玉珠（女），周慶選（男），王　昌（男）。</p>
<p>機上工作人員罹難者，有正機師查爾斯沙凱，副機師萬漢光，無綫電報務員王成志等三人。合計遇難者四十二人。現兩公司已允將乘客屍體運回上海，至於撫卹及賠償問題，尙待從長計議。</p>
<h3>美機冒險出發　證實該機失事</h3>
<p>美軍發表處理詳情</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市美海軍當局發言人昨日深夜發表關於中國航空公司第一二一號客機在靑島墮毀一事，美軍方面處理之詳情經過。據該美方發言人稱：五日晨中航公司事前雖並未通知美方有機在靑降落，僅依一往慣例，美海軍之種稱降落設備，皆全部供給應用。美海軍最初接得中航「有機過時未抵達」之電吿，係在中午十二時十分，當時氣候雖極惡劣，海軍仍派遣水上飛機一架冒險出發搜索並援救。該機出發後不久，駕駛員史密斯（E．C．Smith）即接獲中航機發現墮毀機殘骸之報吿，地點係在離靑島機場東北五英里一座高一千一百呎之山麓。駕駛員史密斯乃飛至該處，證實此說非虛。　靑島機塲司令官麥金泰上校當即派出搜索救護隊，會同中航公司代表前往出事地點。當時發現飛機業已全毀，乘客飛行人員無一倖免。</p>

<h3>京區實行大赦令　地院已釋監犯三十餘人　平兩法院研究釋放手續</h3>
<p>〔太報南京六日電〕國府頒布大赦令後，首都區奉命即於元旦府令公布後開始施行，連日首都高地兩院忙碌異常，高院方面除將已判決之最重本刑爲有期徒刑以下之刑各案之申請覆判及上訴者，依刑事訴訟法第一九四條第三款規定，均論知免訴之判決外，趙琛院長並於六日召見該院監獄科長胡泰夫，對釋放監犯工作，詳爲指示，不日即可執行。地院方面則於四日開始執行，兩日來已釋監犯三十餘人，現老虎橋監獄普通監舍中囚犯，每日均以此爲話題，紛紛論計太身將如何獲赦减刑，倍極歡欣興奮，惟「　舍」中之漢奸羣頗爲不安，正醞釀要求教免，妄想逃罪。</p>

<h3>李世芳空中罹難　梅博士悼高足夜不成眠　姚玉芙嘆嬌婿歸諸命運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次罹難之乘客中，平劇名伶「小梅蘭芳」李世芳（見圖）亦在內。</p>
<p>李爲梅蘭芳得意弟子之一，此次來滬，寓居梅宅已半載有餘，最近經梅師親自指示，學得「玩藝」，「身段」不少，技藝益精，而梅蘭芳亦深感滿意。失事前兩日（即本月二日夜間），尙與其師梅蘭芳合　「金山寺」於中國戲院，不意此次演出後，竟成絕響，當此平劇人才凋零之際，實堪惋惜！</p>
<p>當前晚十時許，梅蘭芳獲得飛機失事消息後，痛悼不已，一夜失眠，已成「淚人兒」一般。迄至昨日，昏昏然食不進，意欲輟演最後一場之「鳳　還巢」，後經各方勸導，始勉强憂戚登台。</p>
<p>但昨夜梅蘭芳前往「中國」後台時，猶兩眼紅腫，「娥眉」雙鎖，呆坐於化粧室中，對鏡默然。其夫人在側，亦淚珠盈眶，不勝戚然。是時鑼緊鼓密，而梅似無動於中，其心緒之不寗，頗有不知如何擺佈之慨。</p>
<p>據李世芳之岳父姚玉芙談：李爲獨子，年僅廿六，結婚已四年，育有三女，其最幼之一女，猶未曾獲見一面，全家現均寓居北平。行前，梅蘭芳曾以飛機屢次失事，勸其緩行，改乘海輪，但終以爲不能如此巧遇，竟毅然就行。不意此去，果成永訣，姚慨然嘆曰：「吾復何言，唯有歸之命運而已耳」！</p>

<h3>中共阻撓堵口工程　薛篤弼提出抗議　盼切實保證不得再發生破壞事件</h3>

<h3>薛氏對記者談　堵口施工狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕記者六日防水利委會委員薛篤弼，渠就最近關於花園口堵口工程施工情形，說明如下：（一）堵口工程現況：口門舊綫椿工，於十二月十一日接合，現口門寬約二百公尺，深約二至三公尺不等，經普遞拋石後，水位逐漸抬高，於十二月二十七日起，已有一部分水流入故道，迄元旦止，渠頭已到達開封縣境；（二）復堤工程：我方堤段已陸續完竣，僅接近中共區　　，施工困難，難　如期完成。至由共區的堤段之修復，則距原來預定標準相差甚遠，且聞有　堤整段夷平，全失防水效力，一旦正式放水，危險堪虞。（三）堵口工程：前因汛期，一度停止進行，大汛後，九月間已復工，惟因汛期口門刷深，汛後水位時漲，另築新綫及石料運輸困難，致未達預定工程進度，估計合籠之期，約須在本年一月中下旬間，現正力排一切困難，日夜拼力趕辦。（四）堵口推進間中共對堵口之異議：中共在京·滬·汴·新歷次商中，對於堵口復堤工程，原則上表示贊同，但曾兩三聲明堵口與復堤及遷移故道河床居民問題，必須兼籌并顯，半年來，據對方對花園口進行堵口拋石及挖引水道事，迭次提出抗議，一則謂缺少工程麵粉，復堤未能竣工，二則請尚未領到遷移費，河床居民未能遷移，其籍故拖延阻撓，迄未稍止。（五）合籠放水，與共產黨區堤段之影響，在下游共產黨區內，復堤及居民遷移兩事未辦竣前，一旦合籠放水，其由中共指使所發生之事態，實無人能預測，縱令再獲協議，着實趕辦，亦須相當時日。</p>
<h3>救濟河床居民　賑款即可發放　行總糾正董必武抗議各節</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕行總與中共代表連日在滬會商救濟河床居民計劃，現已議妥，日內運放賑款。</p>
<p>〔本市〕訊日昨中共代表董必武氏突在京發表對聯總行總及水利委員會之抗議書，記者為明瞭真相，特走訪行總發言人，承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>「董必武先生發表之抗議書，係廣泛而言，其中關於花園口放水問題，係屬工程範圍，本署尚未接獲報告，正在調查。惟董先生所所提河床居民救濟費一節，涉及本署業務，不得不加以說明，以期各方人士明瞭真相：查黃河故道居民救濟費，於去歲十一月間呈奉政府核准後，本署霍署長立即邀請中共代表，聯總艾格頓將軍，及水利委員會負責人，會商實施辦法，經一致同意發放之原則為：在本年一月五日以膠發放總額之三分之二，餘額在本年一月底發放，原則既定，遂進行會商具體執行辦法。自去年十一月廿三日迄今，共開會六次，不意每次均遇困難，新的難題不斷的被提出，使本署謁望解決之救濟河床居民問題，至今尚未實現，以上六次會議，每次聯總均有代表參加會談，對於癥結所在，瞭如指掌，無論枝節如何橫生，本署始終委曲求全，以期實惠災民。在會談過程中，本署之基本立場係一本過去前蔣署長延黻與周恩來先生同意之原則（即救濟物資及款項，必須直接由本署給予被救濟之人民）除此以外，無不可讓步者。　　···</p>
<p>以上所述，係會談以過之實際情形，董先生抗議書中所稱：「河床救濟費，行總又以枝節問題，藉口拖延至今。」顯與事實經過不無出入，河床居民之救濟費用，政府已將第一期款項早經撥交本署。頃據負責人表示談判已大体同意，如無新問題發生，日內即可開始發放云，惟愿共体人民之痛苦，使救濟計劃順利完成」。</p>

<h3>調節民需平衡糧價　東北決設常平倉</h3>
<p>照市價購買農糧避免穀賤傷農</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽六日電〕東北物價，邇來頻頻上漲，惟為農民生計來源之農產品價，未能與一般物價平衡，致農民生計日艱，往年以糧一石可易布三疋，而今日一疋布反可易糧一石，穀賤傷農現象，已形成東北農村之嚴重威脅。東北經濟當局有鍳於斯，擬於近期成立常平倉，以調節民需，平衡糧價。據經委會田糧處處長梁敬錚稱：常平倉之設立，非為財政，而純以經濟為目的，政府絕無從中牟利之意，將來糧食之購買，即不假手地方政府，以免辦理不善，為害農民，而重蹈日人時壓榨農民之出荷制度，亦不由各大公司代為購買。常平倉辦法，乃根據市價購買，俾農民積存糧食，務糧茺時以平價出售，抑制糧價，如辦理得法，裨益國計民生，實深且遠。</p>

<h3>搶救飛機！搶救人命！</h3>
<p>— 黃厦千</p>
<p>去年我國航空界的不幸事件，接連發生，實在太嚴重了。遠在去年的春初，即有戴笠將軍乘機遇難，在此事件發生前後，另有航空公司飛機二架，航委會運輸機一架失事。十二月十四日中央公司飛機一架，在長興縣境失事之後，聖誕節在本市又跌毀中央公司飛機一架，中國公司飛機二架，死傷八十餘人。本年開始才數日，而五日晨，又有中國公司平滬班機一架，在青島附近失事，全部機員乘客共四十三人遇難，報載「血肉模糊，無法辨認，」慘狀可想而知。一架又一架的飛機跌傷，一堆又一堆的死人出現，一批又一批的財物損失，能不令人觸目驚心！我國的飛機，本來不多，添購亦大費錢，如此損失不已，豈不要枯竭？我國航空事業，方在開始，一堆又一堆的死人出現，豈不將使有意乘坐飛機者望而卻步？倘若有一國家更重要的人物，亦以乘坐飛機遇難，豈不更是國家民族永遠不能補償的損失？故在今日飛機屢次失事之後，我們不能不來一個大聲疾呼：「趕快搶救飛機！搶救人命！」</p>
<p>搶救飛機，其法不難，袛要就飛機失事的原因，　為分析，就很容易明白了。去年我國境內幾次飛機失事的原因，報上均有記載，總括一句說，不外天氣惡劣，前日中國公司滬平班飛機在青島失事的原因，仍然是天氣（霧）的關係，可知欲搶救未跌毀的飛機，未跌死的人命，亦惟有從天氣方面注意。天氣雖不能由人力造成，亦不容易用人力改變，但可用人力調查，并可用人力預測，預測的準確程度，已可達到百分之九十以上，除了細微未節以外，天氣方面足以影響飛行安全的變化，已完全可預測到了。試想在飛機出發以前，關於沿途及目的地的天氣狀況，倘能知道得清清楚楚，那裏還會有「飛蛾撲火」的笨飛機師？</p>
<p>美國近年因飛機失事，大多由於天氣關係，乃從注意天氣方面，謀航行的安全，各航空公司內咸有專司測候及預報天氣的氣象人員，每一飛機起飛之前，必須至氣象人員辦公室查閱天氣圖，并聽受氣象人員對於天氣方面的解釋，及飛行方面的指示，務使飛機師對於沿途及目的地的天氣狀況，知道得清清楚楚，然後起飛登程，近來美國各飛機場的調配員（即控制飛機出發與否的人員），亦改由氣象人員擔任，以加重氣象人員的職權，俾依據天氣情況，控制飛機出發與否，如近來這幾次飛機的失事，固然是由於天氣不佳，而這一種天氣，既不是突變，亦不是氣象方面所不能注意得到的。就拿聖誕節那天的事情來講：國防部第二廳氣象總站，在二十四日無綫電廣播天氣預告中，已講陰能見度（即能見到之距度）僅有一英里，二十五日上午十一時廣播預告中，更明白說出能見度將降至半英里及十六分之三英里，降落已屬十分困難。前日青島的濃霧，係屬冬令早晨，天氣方面常有的現象，日出較久乒乓極易消滅，可惜我國航空公司中，尚未切實舉辦氣象事業，更談不到美國境內飛機起飛前的種種辦法，因而除天黑能見度惡劣為害外，晨霧也能肇禍。往者不談，顧交通當局尺歷次飛機失事原因所得教訓，督促航空公司，切實注意天氣，舉辦氣象事業，搶救未失事的飛機，搶救未被犧牲的人命；縱然稍為增加一點支出，也較一次損失二十五億元，還賠了數十條人命為上算吧！</p>
<h3>上海市衛生行政之檢討</h3>
<p>— 周立</p>
<p>從第一次市參議會開會到現在，倐忽已將半年，此半年中市政當局的諸般措施，有令人稱慰之處，亦有令人失望之處。現在且就衛生方面作一探討。我們對於本市衛生行政，一個籠統的印象，是言詞多而實際少，而在實際上則又是機構與人事變更多而商務的推進少。</p>
<p>衛生工作本是最實際的工作，用不到「多言」。我們相信衛生局的負責人，也不致面對着上海市的無數實際問題而自造空中樓閣。可是衛生局向我們提出的計劃，竟是一個「二十五年計劃」。二十五年是多長的時間，我們處在這樣變動劇烈的時代，對於關係着計劃本身的許多因素，不要說無從控制，並且亦無法捉摸，所以要說計劃到二十五年，實在是難以想象。</p>
<p>回頭看看實際。第一，在醫藥管理方面，例如對於醫院診所的管制，中央有法規明白規定：如何為診所，如何為醫院，上海市有許多以醫院為名的，在設備條件上只能稱為診所，這一點照法令必須由衛生局加以審查與糾正，而這又是極容易辦的一椿事情，可是據我們所知，有些不成醫院的醫院，都由衛生局照原名批準登記了，試看報上所登調騐煙民的醫院名單，便可知道此一事實。對於藥品管理，中央也有法規規定未領許可證之成藥不許發賣，其審查取締之責任，亦屬之於當地衛生主管機關。上海市上不合格的藥品銷行甚多，衛生局并不加以干涉；最妙的是，藥品廣告必須經過衛生局的檢查方可在報上刊登，而衛生局對於未領許可證的藥品竟亦輕輕通過，如所謂治肺癆特效藥「使他肺安定」便是一例。直到後來，製藥業鬧起來了，與論界又有嚴厲的指謫，於是衛生局才開始登記通告來，說要對藥品執行管理了。就此二事，可以見到衛生局行事之遲鈍。</p>
<p>上海市的公營醫療事業，在勝利之初，利用了敵偽時代所遺機構作基礎，而加以整理充實，原已俱備了一個相當可觀的規模。可是最近半年來，所有這些市立醫院產院療養院等，幾乎沒有一個不鬧人事問題經費問題，尤其是經濟上的困難迫令此等事業搖搖欲墮。原來衛生局對於所有此行醫療機構改取了一個強制「自給自足」的政策。所謂「自給自足」，乃是衛生局不給錢了，各醫院要維持生存，由各醫院自己想辦法去找錢。這決策使各醫院當局痛心，尤其使一般民眾痛心。我們一方面聽見衛生局添醫院增病床的計劃，另一方面卻看到衛生局要病家負担市立醫院的經費；一方面聽見辦衛生行政的人　　不休的說要實行公醫制度，另一方面卻又隻看到他用「自給自足」的原則呌各醫院對貧苦民眾關起門來！此外，對於救濟物資，衛生當局并未能作適當的利用；對於接收所得的敵營藥店之類，我們在過去知道有個藥品供應處，利用了房屋與藥物，曾為市民一度服務，現在藥品供應處取消，那些房屋聽說多半作了職員宿舍，一部分還關閉着，連同原藏物資，滿屋子的堆上了灰塵。</p>
<p>第二，在保健防疫方面，我們知道衛生當局這半年來對於防疫工作非常注重，提起防疫成績，似乎又非常長得意，所以就從防疫說起吧。我們不能抹殺，去年上海發生霍亂的時候，衛生局的防疫人員，晝夜工作，確實盡了不少的勞力，而疫勢之不擴大，亦顯然是遏止之功，最要是開始時就有相當的準備。我們在此願意貢獻兩點意見：一·防疫應有經常的計劃，不可僅作一時的應付。二·各種防疫設施應視需要而予以維持。在醫院「自給自足」的原則下，兩個傳染病醫院也要呌他自給自足，之是絕對不合理的。</p>
<p>第三，在環境衛生方面：例如街道里弄的清潔問題，半年前沒有解決，半年後是沒有解決，而且顯得更嚴重，甚至沒有辦法。清道夫役不是不肯勤奮服務的，可是我們一直不曾見到他們對公家必揮出最大的工作效率。衛生局近來想出一個方法，呌做「清潔區管制」，想把這一責任嫁到組織示臻健全的保甲頭上去。我們覺得「清潔區管制」是個有趣的觀念，但若付之實行，因為保甲本身不夠健全，只怕清潔工作愈弄愈糟。不是說「清潔區管制」這樣一個新制度難行，就是呌每一里弄築一個垃圾箱，發動了這許多日子了，還是沒有築齊。不過我們以為築垃圾箱倒并不是一件太難的事，所差似在市政當局不夠督促。由垃圾箱我們聯想到公廁。上海市區遼闊，公廁數量不足，市府為此曾撥鉅款與衛生局，令其擇地添建公厠。我們知道衛生局早已收到此項專款，但沒有用在公廁上。傳說用到防疫工作上去了，又說是移充購買垃圾車輛之用了，不論用在何處，我們總覺得添建公廁确屬必要，市府此一措置是對的。衛生局沒有依照原定計劃執行，將指定用途的款項移作別用是不對的。</p>
<p>再如糞便的收運，衛生局這半年來也沒有一點改進的成績，糞夫勒索如舊，糞車滲漏如舊。在根本上，衛生局對於此項商務之維持市辦，或招商承包，半年來一直依違躊躇不已。上海的糞便商務，過去一直是招商承辦的。因為商辦弊端甚多，所以勝利之後，衛生局毅然收歸自辦，這實在是一個賢明的措置。但衛生局主管一經更易，商界之議便隨之而起，後來此議忽息；但最近又聽說決定改為商辦了。衛生局對此一件事，忽而繼續自辦，忽而又要招商承包。不知何以如此一再變卦？</p>

<p>目前自揚州南通以下，已恢復的主要幹路，揚淸綫通揚綫全程通車，通楡綫通至鹽城，假使隴海東段的國軍一會師，直達贛榆的公路交通，當可全面復員。此外連接在三條幹錢上的分支路，大小數十條，數也數不淸，譬如由本縣通到靖泰境內，由泰縣通到口岸江邊，由東合南通海門啓東通到海灘地帶，由高寳淸淮通到各鄉區的短程公路，都像蘇北內河的港汶一般，紛歧而四達。</p>
<p>這許多條公路，雖然有些地方，因爲車輛缺乏，未能全部駛行商車，但是大部份都已經有客車行駛，商旅便捷異常，造成超過戰前的交通發達現象。這裏面的原因有數個：一是綏靖區裏人民，恐怕沿途間有不穩，都希望利用很快的交通工具—汽車，早行早到。二是被戰亂擠逼出來的許多失業者，都走上了跑單帮的道路，不斷地洗來流去。三是在江南吃交通轉運飯的，利用着新開闢的道許多條公路，很多搬塲到蘇北，想在這一片荒蕪的土地上，淘起金來。</p>
<p>共軍無法破壞</p>
<p>共軍雖然以「扒路」附名，但是這一次在蘇北的扒路成績，却表現異常失敗。人民都不像在抗日期中，勇敢地帮助共軍破壞公路，相反地人民却組織了自衛隊，帮助政府和國軍保護公路，把少數打游擊打埋伏的共軍和政工人員，趕離了公路邊，由此可以窺見蘇北人民望治厭亂的心理，和共軍在蘇北軍事政治同這慘敗的跡象。到目前爲止，許多條公路上，沿途都有了守望的碉堡，由駐軍和當地自衛隊，切實守衛着，公路橋樑被毀斷的現象，更是百無一見。</p>
<p>由於公路事業的發展，的確也解決了一大羣人的生活，同時也使許多地方畸形繁榮起來。目前蘇北最繁榮的地方是三州，（揚州泰州通州）和泰縣的海安鎭，這些地方都是公路的交叉點。如皋縣城從前也是公路集中點，但是最近因爲如新（新生港路），如李（李堡）路未能暢通，城南車站，一時還未能顯得十分熱鬧，但是已經有一大批車站茶房，職員，攤販，搬運伕……獲得每天生活的收入了。</p>
<p>野鷄汽車充斥</p>
<p>這些公路上的汽車公司，大大小小，多到有數百個，比較設備饅好的是揚州鎭揚等公司，最近並爲便利旅客起見，計劃舉辦與江南京滬綫的火車聯運；其次是南通中央公司等，汽車裏尙可有一點座位，再以不差不多就都是些運貨車，人和貨物猪仔裝在一起，不但坐不下，有時連站都站不牢，車頂上連蓬布都沒有，刮風下雨，儘你去够受。坐在上面，遠不如在江南被人詛咒的四等火車，但是它的乘坐代價，常常要超過京滬路頭等車價好多。</p>
<p>這是蘇北公路當局的管理不嚴密，野鷄汽車公司太多，多不邀守行車章程，和公定的里程票價。有些野鷄『公司』，僅有一部汽車，全是幾個混空朋友和失業車伕合組起來的，他們向上海租到一輛舊貨車，每月租價一兩百萬元，可是裝一趟南通到東台的來回，據說就可以找到百十萬元，他們祗知死命的裝人裝貨，多掙鈔票，至於車身和公路橋樑的載重量，以及旅客的安全，一切在所不顧，最近單在通揚一錢，壓斷橋樑，撞車軋人的亂子，就都曾發現過。</p>
<p>黃牛黨的活動</p>
<p>有些車站的秩序尤其凌亂得可以，黃牛黨的勢力，比上海戲院門前的還要厲害。原來那些野鷄公司的事站都是露天，黃牛黨便做了露天公司的站長，售票員，接客茶房，沒有到過這些地方的外方旅客，你一走上那些小市鎭的汽車集中地，馬上會有人來問你要到那裏去，假使一吿訴，他是到什麼地方，馬上他便說；「車子五分鐘就開，票價若干若干，請你拿來！」你給了他的票錢，但是票子呢，他，黃牛，人便是票子，你得跟着他跑到這裏那裏，直等他把你送到一輛剛開的野鷄汽車上，和汽車快結渦賬，當面交代了，你才能穩心地爬上車去，否則準敎你再付第二筆車錢。</p>
<p>其次，還有一個値得注意的問題；就是蘇北的公路，够不上江南那樣修整，百分之八九十是泥土路面，一遇陰雨，簡直毫無辦法。照蘇北目前公路交通發達情形，養路費的收入一定不會少，蘇省公路當局，最好能自現在起，切實注意改進蘇北公路交通，將幾條主要的公路，首先改舖石子路面。此外對於車站的管理制度，客貨車載述里程票價，以及各站客車開行時刻，均須加以嚴密規定。或由公路當局，加派客車到蘇北各綫來行駛，嚴禁黃牛黨等需索搗亂情形，使商旅往來，能獲得理想的便利。</p>
<p>交通發達是促成文明和文化的推進的，閉塞和落後的蘇北，經這一番變亂後，的確需要改造，需要開發，改善公路交通，也是開發蘇北的重要施政之一，今後希望蘇省府和公路當局，對這一問題能多加注意爲幸。（十二月廿七日）</p>

<h3>杜魯門向國會演說　闡述本年施政大綱　籲請共和黨在立法計劃方面實行合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：杜魯門總統今日下午向參衆兩院聯席會犧，發表本年度施政大綱之演說，涉及國內國外問題十五種之多。總統　請兩院予渠以合作，否則必危及國家安全。總統指出美國對內對外施政之密切關係，其言有云：「我人在國內之旅政，其能否達到目的，實與對外措置發生密切連緊。鑒於美國領導世界之事實，我人維護健全與繁榮經濟及改善民生之工作，已有更大之意義。我人在國內所能做到與所不能做到者，不特與我人本身有關，日將影響全世界。我人如欲對本身及其他民族完成任務，必須促使美國在級濟，社會及政治方面，均臻於健全，如此，始可帮助造成其他國家之和平因素，此種因素亦即政治穩定，及經濟與社會進展是也。</p>
<p>對義·保·羅·匈各國之和約巳備妥，各該條約將於下月在巴黎簽訂，此後，即將送呈美參院批准。本政府認為各該和約，並不完全令人滿意，但無論其缺陷何在，我人甚願我人之戰時盟友能獲致協議，因任何延宕，均將危及關係各國之政治安定也。」</p>
<p>就國內問題而言，其要點如次：（一）以勞工法送呈兩院，禁止罷工，並成立委員會調査勞資關係。（二）新預算案收支平衡，建議在六月三十日滿期後，繼績實施戰時稅則。（三）以新的經濟計劃呈交兩院，要求繼續限制專利及不公允之商業方法。</p>
<p>保持強大軍力防禦閃電襲擊</p>
<p>關於軍縮及世界集體安全問題，杜魯門總統云：「我人必須雅持强大之軍力，直至在聯合國下之集體安全建立為止，此後，美國即可在集體軍縮方面，領導進行，但在此未實現前，美國不應減弱軍力，致遭他國之進攻。一九四六年我人巳完成戰時軍力之復員工作，現僅維持足能自衛及完成國際義務之軍力。若負有重責之國家放棄其責任，則世田穩定，必遭摧毀。在目前之時期中，不可預知之進襲，可在前所未有之速度下來臨。我人必須有充分力量，擊破此種可能之進襲。職是之故，我人必使我人之軍隊，護得精良之配備與訓練，並在緊急時期動員一切人力。在七月一日前，陸軍人數將减至一百另七萬人，海軍則减至五十七萬一千人，駐外佔領軍現亦僅能執行我人外交政策所需要之任務而巳，無論如何，維持足够軍力之責任，在於國會」。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕若干觀察家認杜魯門總統之演說已脫離華萊士領導之左翼新政系，而愈益接近貝爾納斯所領導之右翼保守系，當羅斯福總統在世時，貝爾納斯固嘗為羅氏內政方面之一大臂助也。若干接近總統之人謂總統之內政意見，與洪和黨之溫和派頗多相同之處，故當總統今白之演說發表後，即可證明政府與議會之黨派雖不同，但在內政方面之合作，仍具充分之可能性。</p>

<h3>國際經濟合作　美盼蘇能參加</h3>
<p>不容有兩國貿易世界</p>

<p>南極</p>
<h3>廿世紀新大陸　美欲分得一百萬方哩</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕此間官方透露美國擬要求分得南極六百萬方哩大陸之一大部份，獲得此項領土之策略，將於巴爾特少將南極探險歸來後定奪。南極政策關係當局今日向某訪員稱，來春將舉行種種會議，討論：（一）美國正式要求南極冰陸領土之時日。（二）提議將國際敵對的要求交由聯合國處理，以免爭論不休。（三）繼目前海軍探險隊之後，將來美國測量之性質，及佔據之努力，及較小之探險隊在羅納中校指揮下之立即出發。巴爾特為南極探險大家，現正乘航空母艦「菲律賓海」號，取追前往南極，加入探險大隊。該隊預定四個月後返國。美國之領土要求大抵以冰陸之西北區，即探險家埃爾斯華滋與巴爾將所到過之區域為根據。兩氏於一九三九——四一年測量後宣稱：美國至少可要求取得南極大陸一百萬方哩，或者更可多獲八十萬方哩。政府之政策，根據美國私人探險家與測量家之要求，不承認英·法·智利，挪威及其他國家之要求。此層副國務卿艾克森上星期已重行聲明·直接爭執之區域之一，在麥戈里特灣一帶，當霍恩角之南，英國探險隊一九四三年在以來，曾在巴爾特早期營地原址發掘。智利亦擬取得該區，羅納之探險隊即以該區為目標。</p>
<p>至於整個問題交由國際法庭公斷或由聯合國處理之議，己由數方面提出。截至目前為止，官方非正式稱此事僅在普通情形下　　之。牽涉南極爭端之各國，目的大抵在利用探險隊作　　測量與佔領，以强調其領土　　。羅納探險隊擬在目的地留駐十四至十八個月，或將抵消英國氣象　擴大佔領麥戈里特灣基址之效力。巴爾特歸來後，將參加會議，討論是否要求國會撥款，作探險之用，此種探險依永久軍路計劃進行，以便多少樹立永久設備。將來珍珠港政策乃以此項計劃為根據。</p>
<p>〔聯合社澳洲雪梨五日電〕「雪梨太陽報〕今日載稱：澳洲已要求取得南極大陸三分之一土地，殆將反對以南極區歸聯合國管理之任何提議。按聯合國管理南極一事，係「華盛頓郵報」最近所倡議，澳洲現正派遺巡邏隊前往南極區，繼之以較大的探險隊，以便要求二百五十萬方哩左右之領士云</p>
<h3>日本賠償問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報哀京特派員　傳俊儀</p>
<p>波茨坦家言規定賣物賠償篇日本所應履行義務之一。關於日本賠償方針，美賠償使節飽萊曾於去年十二月六日發表一中間報吿，規定作為賠償對象應行撤走之物資為：</p>
<p>（一）機器工具製造能力應減低半數（約三十五萬架至四十萬架），陸海軍兵工廠，航空機製造所，鋼珠，轉軸工塲及航空機發動機工塲等全部設備，均廠撤走。</p>
<p>（二）鋼鐵年產在二百五十噸以上者，應行撤走（現產一千一百萬噸）。</p>
<p>（三）造船廠二十處。</p>
<p>（四）火力發電之半數。</p>
<p>（五）最新式苛性碱工塲四十一處，應撤走二十處。</p>
<p>華府遠東委員會亦曾於八月廿日發表一案，同時盟國最高統帥部早巳於本年一月對日本軍需工廠，其研究所及航空機工堪六百八十二所，發出管理命令，指定為賠償對象。繼於八月廿四日再將造船工廠廿五處，民營軍需工廠二百七十五處，機城工具工塲九處，鋼珠工廠廿處，鋼鐵廠廿四處，等碱灰廠一處，苟性碱廠十八處及火力發電廠廿處，計五百零五工廠，指定為賠償工廠。同時更將前次指定之航空機工塲追加二虛　削除三十二處，在節後兩次所指定之工廠計　一千零二所。復於十一月六日再加以改訂，將不適合賠償水準之工廠予以削除，減為九百五十三工廠。於本月七七日再作第三次之改訂，除自硫酸，機械工具，精密鋼珠工榮，民機　需工臘中　除十二賓外，復追加二廠，現所指定之賠償，其數如下：</p>
<p>航空機工塲，陸海軍兵工廠，研究試騐所，四六六。</p>
<p>精密軸承工塲　三一。</p>
<p>造船所　二四。</p>
<p>蘇由工　　四一。</p>
<p>硫酸工廠　二三。</p>
<p>機械工具工廠　八五。</p>
<p>發電所　二〇。</p>
<p>民營兵工廠　二三〇。</p>
<p>製鋼製廠　二一。</p>
<p>合計　九四三</p>
<p>將此近千所工廠撤走作為賠償後，對於日本工業所受的影響，據金鑼鑽經濟雜誌所優點計，將令日本經濟水凖，倒退在十年以上，（昭利十二年即中日戰爭勃發之時）。</p>
<p>十一月廿八日所發表之鮑萊最後案，其內容較前次中間報吿，尤以機械，工具，鐵鋼，鐵道事輛，化學等工業部門為甚。鮑萊前次之報告，機械工具僅擬撤去現有台數之半數，計卅五萬架至四十萬架，免則擬徹去六十萬架，僅留十五萬五千架，平爐製鋼能力將撤去六百萬噸，電氣爐製鋼能力將撤去三百萬噸。昭和十九年的生產能力，平爐八百萬噸，電氣爐能力為三百萬噸，結果鋼塊年產將削减為二百廿五萬噸。昭和九年（一九三四年）之鋼材消費量為三百十五萬五千噸。據鮑萊提案，此後日本最低消費量為三百萬噸，結果日本侮年必須自亞洲各國輸入鋼材百萬噸。鐵道車輛部門，火車頭九百七十輛貨車三萬輛，由聯合國分配。戰後日本有保有之車輛計火車頭五千入百六十六輛，貨軍十一萬九千七百六十輛。關於微維工業，最後報吿限定為三百萬錠，戰前日本紡織機設備約一千二百萬錠，實際操業錠數計八百萬錠。據東洋經濟雜誌之估計，目前需六百五十萬錠，始足維持國內需要，及償付輸人原料棉花之代價。</p>
<p>茲將十二月二十八日發表之鮑萊案與八月二十十日之遠東委員案及昭和十二年（中日戰爭勃發之一九三七年）並本年十月之日本全要生產能力作一比校，有如下表：</p>

<h3>參議會二次大會　隆重舉行開幕禮　出席議員一四七人　今日會議中對警教等局將提質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第二次大會，昨晨九時半在安和寺路正始中學開幕。該會會址距離中區遙遠，而昨日天雨泥濘，但參議員表現精神頗佳。此次報到參議員共一六七人，昨日出席者一四七人。又各報總經理總編輯及社會名流被邀請參加者二十餘人，市府各局長官則亦列席。大會開始前，首舉行紀念週，由潘議長，吳市長，方主任委員，程監察使相繼致詞。休會十分鐘，由吳市長報告施政，歷一小時，各參議即紛紛提出質詢，市長則先作一簡單綜答覆，詳細情形將由各局長分別作答，大會第一次會議於十二時四十五分散會。</p>
<p>潘議長開幕詞　希望完成責任</p>
<p>紀念週出潘議長主持，行禮如儀後，致開幕詞，略謂：「市參議會第一次大會休會以來，已有三月有餘，大會所提各項決議案，市府已在逐步施行。今第二次大會在新年開幕，其意義甚為重大，所謂「一年之計在於春，」一年工作正應在此時計劃決定。此次會議日程，雖僅一週，但其任務並不下於上次大會，除須首先討論市府提出中心工作計劃外，對於卅六年度預算尤為重要。希望各位同仁代表各方意見，一方面須顧到人民負担，一方面亦須體諒市府施政之困難，在此大會中完成代表應盡之責任，謹在開幕之時，把個人意見簡單貢獻，同時請市長多予指教，俾在會議時作為參考」。</p>
<p>市長希望二點　達到繁榮市面</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞稱：個人有感想二點：（一）今後寫卅五年度上海歷史，一定會想到市參議會之成立及其成功，市參議會乃真正機構，對所有決議案均經詳細審核決定，市府亦必根據大會意見實施工作。（二）卅六年將為上海歷史中最困苦艱難的一年。兄弟負責行政，感到困難之處甚多，希望市參議會仍以上次大會精神，晝指教協助，則必可達到上海市安定繁榮之希望」。</p>
<p>方主委詞</p>
<p>旋由方主任委員致詞，略謂：「市參議員係由全市四百萬市民選舉出來，市民必在後面高呼「一定要替老百姓說話」，故希望各位參議員高度發揮能力，但亦希望能充分體諒政府。市長猶如汽車司機，市民如坐在汽車中，要汽車開得好，必須互相合作。</p>
<p>程監使詞</p>
<p>程監察使滄波亦發表感想及祝詞云：「卅六年為中國民主憲政開始的一年，上海民意機關在新年間開幕，是象徵民主。但國家目前有二種相反趨勢：（一）和平統一民主，（二）破壞和平統一民主。上海在各種社會惡勢力圍攻之下，不能安定，然要安定中國必須安定上海。故市參議會之責任，不但在討論方案，且須拿出許多力量來安定上海，使社會上許多不平事情可以消滅，民間痛苦減除。如此次攤販事件，參議員不避危險，親往調查，此種精神實可欽佩並仍望繼續，此即安定上海之表現。此外，主席曾昭示，上海奢靡荒淫，社會風氣敗壞，達官顯宦，每遇婚喪喜事，大事鋪張，此並非上海之光榮而係恥辱，如能加以改善，轉移風氣，亦可安定上海。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕上海市參議會第一屆第二次大會，定今日下午二時至五時舉行第二次會議，對警察社會衛生教育局等提出質詢。會前出席國大之代表，並將有所報告。</p>
<h3>對不起參議員　對不起滬市民　吳市長作施政報告　檢討工作認為未盡滿意</h3>
<p>休息十分鐘後，吳市長繼作施政報告，長歷一小時，略謂參議會第一次大會對於市政設施各決議案，本人曾盡力招待，迄今三月，檢討施政未能滿意，尤其如物價問題，社會秩序，攤販事件，以及最近學潮，深覺對不起參議會，對不起上海市民，但各局在可能範圍內，已作最大之努力，此應在報告前特別提出者。</p>
<p>戶籍調查準確</p>
<p>民政方面：（一）關於自治部份，現有保甲組織共卅區，一〇五六保，二四九六三甲。調整區劃，勘查蘇省與本市各界，警教衛各分區與自治區劃配合。今飭各區成立區調解委員會，調解民刑事糾紛，建造區公所房屋，訂立保甲規約，與民選區長之籌備。（二）關於戶政部份，辦理初次戶籍登記過錄與經常戶籍登記，（三）關於兵役部份，擬訂卅五年度壯丁調查實施辦法，優待征屬部份及籌設軍事科曁所屬各級區保隊附等工作。本人曾赴各區視察，如貧民窟，棚戶區等，均曾親自調查戶籍，結果可說百分之百皆極準確。此於辦理地方自治基層機構，關係甚鉅，差堪告慰。</p>
<p>警政較前進步</p>
<p>警政方面：如查騐民槍，防緝盜匪，整理娼妓，肅清煙毒，管理交通，整飭市容，整理戶口，管理特種營業，組織義務警察，成立刑警大隊，加強新警訓練，實施警管區制，添置消防設備，加強救護工作等，皆積極推進。警察人員待遇菲薄，雖經調整，仍感極低，警士每月薪金不足十五萬元，此為主管人員所最感困難之問題。在過去三月中，警察局對於破獲盜刧案件，勒贖案件，在報告書中均有詳表列載，不特發生於本市之案件，均能迅速破獲；且發生於外埠之案件，在本地破獲者亦甚多。此種情形，較以前租界時期頗有進步。</p>
<p>希望增加警察人數</p>
<p>上海現有警察一六一六〇人，預算中之警察人數為二二八三一人。全世界警政辦理最完善者為倫敦，約五百居民有一警察。美國紐約則為二百居民有一警察，上海人口現共四百餘萬，如需求社會安定，按照紐約二百萬居民一警察之比例來算，則需二萬餘人，現今每三月訓練出一批警察，故希市議會能通過預算，達到上海有二萬餘警察之數。</p>
<p>社會工作不易見功</p>
<p>社會方面：社會局所主管之事務甚多，易見過而不易見功。如勞資糾紛之調解，評定物價，推行勞工福利設施，推行全作事業，各種團體之組訓，度量衡檢定，設立救濟機構，辦理冬賑，救濟失業工人，農業推廣與農塲登記等。七八九三個月中工潮略見減少，但至最近又復增多，特別在舊歷年底將屆之時，調解各項工潮，煞費周章。關於年終獎勵金問題，社會局吳局長勞工處趙處長已盡最大努力，期使工潮減至最低限度。</p>
<p>教職員增加千餘人</p>
<p>教育方面（一）中等教育：整頓並扶助私立中學校，改善教師待遇及充實學校設備，提高師資及整理學籍。（一）國民教育：增加學校，修理校舍，整頓及維持私立小學，推行輔導制度，提倡健康教育。（三）社會教育：積極掃除文盲，推進社教事業，舉行社教活動，調整社教機構。（四）督導工作：實行分區督導，計劃專科督導，舉行座談會，處置緊急事項。市政府依據參議會第一次大會決議，增加教育經費，學校班數亦增，詳情均見書面報告。市政府全體員工曾裁減九百餘人，因教育事業費增加，學校數額旣增，班次亦增，因此約增加教職員千餘人，此係特殊情形。</p>
<p>工務</p>
<p>工務方面：在此三月中有兩事應特別提出報告者，一係海塘工程，經積極施行之結果，在秋冬潮汛時期浦東一帶，均免水患。一係防汛工程，經積極疏導溝渠</p>
<p>至改善中區交通問題，經二月之研究，逐步實施，故在去年九十兩月份，曾有顯著之進步。但最近中區情形，又恢復至去年九月以前之狀態。改善中區交通，誠為當前重大問題。詳加檢討，旣非執行不力，亦非辦法不善，實有兩大原因：一，由於車輛（包括機動車與非機動車）由十九萬餘輛增加至二十二萬餘輛。</p>
<p>取締攤販　由於妨礙</p>
<p>二，由於攤販妨礙交通，取締攤販並非為整頓市容，完全為中區交通，倘為整頓市容需全市從嚴取締其所以祗限於黃浦老攤，即由於該兩區交通過於擁擠之故。關於此事，市政府特擬具專案，送參議會請詳予指教，（五）水上交通：成立市輪渡公司，增闢市輪渡航線。（六）碼頭倉庫：籌復南市碼頭，籌組南市碼頭倉庫公司。（七）倉庫電話：加緊添裝路燈，改進電話設施。（八）其他：實施征收公用專業附加捐，調整公用事業價格。</p>
<p>地政方面</p>
<p>地政方面：（一）土地登記情形尚稱順利，凡以前未登記之土地，大致均已向地政局辦理登記手續，結束黃浦等主區土地總登記。清理外人土地權利，舉辦公地登記。（二）開徵地價稅，此係依據參議會第一次大會決議所實行者。（三）地權清理。（四）公地清查。</p>
<p>衛生</p>
<p>衛生方面：（一）改善清道清潔，充實運輸工具，改進運輸方法，加強管理方法。（二）增進防疫工作，去年秋間霍亂盛行，勢極猖獗，依據當時之情勢，深恐疫勢將較一九三八年為烈，經衛生局發動全體防疫人員積極工作，成效頗著，疫勢較一九三八年輕，殊非預料所及。他如防制赤痢傷寒，防禦白喉腦膜炎，秋冬種痘，減蠶消毒，減蚊防瘧，防制狂犬病，防治性病癆病，治本防疫設施，儲備防疫器材等，均積極推行。（三）充實醫療設備，擴充醫院床位，調整醫院分佈，開辦郊區醫院，增設平民診所，調整醫院免費，輔助急癥貸金。（四）擴展婦嬰保健，推廣安全助產，產前產後護理，擴充產床設備，增設保嬰門診，試辦兒童會。（五）加強學校衛生。（六）倡導兒童及青年健康活動。（七）厲行醫藥管理，取締醫藥廣告，扶持製藥工業，舉辦醫藥登記。（八）整飭衛生管理，清除積柩，整理菜塲檢查肉品，整理公墓，加強檢騐。</p>
<p>財政方面</p>
<p>財政方面：分收入，支出，各種稅捐之整頓，整理公產公債等點，市政府征收捐稅以不擾民為原則，財政局依據參議會之決議，一方面整頓稅收，一方面顧及市民負担，絕未有擾民情事。</p>
<p>檢討市政設施</p>
<p>槪括檢討過去三月市政一切設施，遜於去年七八九三月之一般情形，公教人員待遇微薄，能在刻苦艱難中勉力從公，可謂已盡最大之努力。當前眾所憂慮者為經濟危機，其因素有四：一高利貸，二高工資，三外貨傾銷，四交通破壞。本人於去年五月蒞滬，曾向工界全體理監事公開表示謂六個月後，經濟危機即將屆臨，不幸而言中。政府對於減輕工商界之高利貸，曾舉辦生產貸款。對於一般工資問題，認為不應採取殺雞求蛋之末策，深望工界設法不再提高工資。關於外貨傾銷，政府已實行進口貨管制。至於交通破壞乃係全國性問題，非一地方所能為力，除以上所述經濟危機之四項因素外，中央在本年中，決以全力穩定全國物價。上海係工商業中心所在地，深望民意機關之代表，提倡節約，遏止投機取巧；並望參議會在各種委員會之外，另組織一小組委員會，對於物價，經濟，以及安定社會秩序諸事，能經常對市政府予以指示。</p>
<p>市財政總預算已縮政策</p>
<p>至於三十六年度市財政總預算，當編制之初，市政府及各局處所需要之經費，約達五千八百餘億減至二千三百〇八億，意在顧到市民之需要，同時顧到市民之負担。編制三十六年度總預算之原則，係採取緊縮政策，與以前租界時期比較，與南京重慶等市比較，用人行政，均非擴大，例如現有警察一萬六千餘人，至今年十月擬增加至二萬二千八百餘人。又如教育局現有人數（包括中小學教職員）為七千餘人，今年擬增加至九千餘人。再如民政處因辦理徵兵，亦需增加職員，因上海係中央所指定之徵定模範區，倘每保增加保隊副一人，助理幹事一人，民政處職員將由二千餘人增加至四千餘人。故在總預算中，市府全體員工名額，共列五萬餘人。總之，本人對市參議會有絕對信心，凡所決定，無不嚴格執行，在此三十六年艱苦奮鬥之年度中，旣望民意機關對於當前經濟危機問題有所指示，並請對於行政部門，各參議員能經常至市府各局處實地視察，詳加指導，不勝榮幸。</p>
<p>強佔校舍　迄未遷讓</p>
<p>周參議員斐成亦問：公私立學校，被其他機關徵用，市府有何辦法處置？警察局保安隊佔用市立尚文小學校舍，迄未遷讓，但同時卻將建國西路前法租界巡捕房原地辦理私立達人中小學，其故安在？此端一開，將來市有公產頗多成為私有之危險，應如何防止？潘參議員介眉稱：本市市立小學教員之底薪過低，生活至苦，前曾出教育局擬具拉回底薪辦法，送請市府核批，市小教職員代表亦一再請求酌量增加，何以至今未曾批覆。王參議員立本書面提出質詢：（一）本學期市校同人待遇遼在私校之下，致市校師資恐慌，市府當局有何補救辦法？（二）市庫出納科對於各市校　取經費當有不禮貌之處，同人為爭取時間，常忍氣吞聲，不知市長能不能請當局嚴予申斥？</p>
<h3>火葬　祗能提倡不可強迫</h3>
<p>唐參議員世昌對於市府清理積極辦法認為不當，應加改善，謂市府十一月二十二日佈告，限本市十餘萬積柩一律於四月底前遷埋，或運回原籍，否則予以火化。關於此點特請市長注意：（一）吾國舊禮教對於飾終典禮，極為重視，市府祗能提倡火化，不能強迫火化。（二）吾國殮屍辦法，極為周密，即停柩數十年者，與衛生亦無妨礙。（三）本市公墓不多，取費極昂，而　鄉交通不便，故遷埋及遷回原藉均有困難。</p>
<p>張參議員中原問：對於社會局評斷委員評斷勞資間糾紛，經評斷後，無論任何一方發生疑問或不同意時：（一）能否申請重行評斷？（二）參議員是否可以參加列席。又前次市長曾說與跑馬廳總會交涉救回跑馬廳事，現在進行到如何程度？</p>
<p>配售物品　應加改善</p>
<p>參議員夏對公教人員配給物品措施表示不滿，（一）配給物品究竟是否由市府負責？流弊太多，如何改善？（二）如糖菓等類物品對於公教人員不需要可勿發。（三）手續過繁，可否簡化？（四）價格雖不能太低以免轉售黑市，但也不宜不予相當優待。（五）能否定期配售？</p>

屬六十餘人。會塲空氣悲憤嚴肅，塲內並置有死難乘客靈位，四壁張貼沈痛標語。受難家屬紛紛抒述家破人亡遺寡留孤之慘痛，一致指責公司當局措施不當。最後決議組織「十二，二五失事飛機罹難乘客家屬伸雪委員會」公推馬頌棣，盧平林，吳乾早，余建夫，姚逢子，丁垚，姚步烈，陶元高，吳錦明，樂俊偉，薛貫一，夏繼良，倪宗耀等十五人為常務委員，負責進行向公司交涉，並向社會呼籲。當塲議決要求政府處理六點：（一）懲辦公司當局負責人員疏忽之罪。（二）令飭兩公司於長短期內，改善一切設備，俾日後飛行得保安全而重乘客生命。（三）建築紀念塔，紀念死難乘客，並隨時警惕飛行員小心工作。（四）運柩回籍及安葬等費用悉由航空公司負担。（五）補償死者家屬，以適當之撫卹金。（六）死難乘客之行李，首飾以及一切錢物，應責令公司負責賠償（損失各物已在詳細登記中。該委員會定於今晨九時，在新生活俱樂部開會繼績商討未盡事宜。　　對於此次慘禍，公司方面失職之處，各家屬提供事實甚多。據稱：（一）一一五號機於中午十二時抵達漢口，如即能續飛，下午四時抵滬，即不致出事。但因機師用膳，耽擱二小時餘，斯時氣候已極惡劣，而公司方面並無高級人員負責指揮，僅憑機師個人意志冒險續飛。（四）四十八號機師陳瑞榮，去年因帶私貨傷機翼，被中國開除，中央竟不顧部章錄用。該機於下午一時抵達南京時，氣象台已宣怖氣候亞劣，但仍不顧危險，繼續飛滬。（三）失事各機在本市上空盤旋數小時，公司當局竟不作緊急措置。據當日至機塲迎接之家屬，目擊機塲中無一高級人員，至六時以後普通辦事人員亦均離丟。（四）失事以後，公司當局未能迅速救護，致有不少受傷之旅客，亦吿畢命，對於屍體又不能負責保護，致財物行李刦掠一空。除此之外尙有不少指賣，昨因時聞關係，改由各家屬用書爾伸述，結供委員會作為交涉挫訴之根據。　　昨晚該會業巳將前項六點要求，電呈交通部及國民參政會，三機失事調査委員會等有關機關呼籲。同時並發表吿全國同胞書。積竊大批　拘獲卅三名　各押兩星期　　〔本報訊〕老閘警局昨晨二時半許，先後在　　路五十二　　泰旅社，同路一四四號　　旅社，聲福建路同慶公旅社等處拘獲盜竊犯快馬，割包，落地爬，拋頂富，跑老西等男女共三十三名。諸犯姓名為王次根，賀志發，陳利祥，張阿毛，黃泉竇，蔣長之，周蘇生，鄭福根，楊根寶，嚴新霍，王德其，善長發，吳得償，沈新康，俞正才，丁阿三，張志財，陳阿三，王愛珍，陽秀英，揚菊英，王阿二，黃毛頭，王阿明，王根發，陳巧根，鄭福，吳德富，邱根弟，王友生，失貴生，茅天英，殷雙福等，一併帶局嚴予偵訊。彼輩年齡由十一歲起，四十餘歲止不等。細審指紋，均係累犯。內中甚且有曾犯案十次，二十次者。該分局施分局長諭令一體禁閉覊押二星期以儆。未核准電台　昨執行取締　　〔本報訊〕交通部上海電訊局奉令整理本市廣播電台，經交通部核准設立者，僅有「亞洲」·「合作」·「中華自由」等十八家，其餘統限於去年年底停止播音，並將電台撤除。唯仍有未遵令執行者。昨日上海電訊局請淞滬警備司令部執行取締，「蘇聯電台」亦在取締之列，據悉蘇聯副領事曾陪同前往，囑令停止播音。項秘書長建議　跑馬廳收回方式　　〔本報訊〕市參議會秘書長項昌欋，近建議將跑馬憲收回。項氏稱，該應原為西人仰仗特殊勢力，用着圈地又賣，賣了又圈的辦法，憑籍着一點口實，僅僅化一萬二千五百兩銀子（一說為一三·五二四·一一八兩），便收買了五百餘畝的歲地，無辜農民，被迫出走，故跑馬廳地皮來歷不正，且為上海市民受帝國主義蹂躪的一種痕跡。其次，跑馬應位置在本市最熱鬧的市中心區，依照目前的市政設計，交通狀况，均不適宜。　　項氏稱，跑馬廳包括本市黃浦區八圖藏字圩一號土地之全部，其中上海跑馬總會佔一三一·三四六畝，上海西僑體育會佔三八九·一二八畝，飛龍公司佔四·三〇八畝，馬立斯佔〇·二九四畝，共計五二五·〇七六畝，折合為五三一·二二五市畝。　　根據條約，法律，以及各項文件，並試擬收回方式如下：　　（一）請求政府以本市郊區相當面積之土地與跑馬廳交換應用，。此種辦法，如獲得雙方同意，便等於私人財物的交換，屬於私法範圍，理論簡單，並不値得作深長之研究，衡諸各國情形，跑馬競技並不禁止，但決不在市區以內闢塲跑馬，故要求跑馬廳交換到郊外，理由甚為充份。但實行時應注意：（甲）現在市中心區的跑馬應，在八十三年前還是一片荒掠的農田，故假定此時將郊區的土地與之交換，也許現在的郊區，數十年後又成熟鬧市區，故一旦實行交換應保留再交換之權利。換言之，何謂郊區，應視本市發展的情形而定。（二）政府是否有可供交換之偌大一塊空地存在？若為跑馬而征用大地，査與現行土地法所列征用土地的條件不合，此點亦値得考慮。　　（二）請求政府遵循外交途徑，與關係國交涉，將跑馬廳土地交還八十三年前的原業主，政府再依需要向原業主征用。依照平等新的的規定，我人對於西人已得權利，原應尊重，但一八六二年強迫農民出賣地皮時，淸延未加制止，事實上確係出於强追行為。西人雖以代價收購，原業主仍可以吾認西人的所有權，且三百廿五個業主中，尙有一百廿戶未去領款，故整個跑馬廳之產權尙有問題。若原有業主出而要求政府索還土地，自應遵値外交途徑代為交涉。如政府有需要，依土地法征收程序加以征用，中華民國之國民，當然服從中華民國之法律，不用懷疑。　　（三）請求政府逕即依照土地法之規定，征用跑馬廳。即已經承認跑馬廳土地為合法取得，根據新的與土地法，為公共事業之需要，加以征收。據跑馬總會給市長覆函中云：「市政府對征收跑馬廳地皮，跑馬總會當隨時可遵行」則征用本無問題，而問題則在征收補償金如何計算，如何籌措。　　征收跑馬廳土地補償金之計算，據我國土地法，土地征收量公法上的權力關係，其主要目的在取得土地所有權，以應公共事業使用的需要。補償金之發給，僅乎是對因征用而使地主所受到的一切損失，，依法予以相當的補償而已。故征收跑馬廳的補償費，應該由本市地政局估計一公平合理之數目。　　至經費如何籌揩一節，雖補償費徑費若干，一時尙難推測，但若跑馬廳房墜不合應用，我人可補償遷移費若千，請其遷移，以减少因征收跑馬廳而所加予市庫的負担。再如為實旅國家經濟政策或交通事業而征收，則尙可依法搭發土地債券，或先行使用。　　又跑馬廳在收買當時，上海通台與英領事雙方曾有換文，略謂「此地收買後專作跑馬與打球之用，永遠不得出售，並不准建造其他與跑馬打球無關之房屋，或出租，或出售。」故有人以為跑馬廳當局可以將改變跑馬廳用途以破壞都市建設計劃來相威脅，實為紀人之憂。且跑馬廳賽馬而附售香檳票，已經中央經釋為賭博，觸犯刑法，則跑馬應永遠不能再作賭博之用，我人為跑馬廳當局着想，為國際友誼計，實臘以極大之讓步，以協助建設新上海也。予囚犯自新機會　大赦令意義重大　地方法院查院長發表感想　　本市地方法院査院長良鑑，昨在該院接見記者：略述對赦免令頒布之感想謂：現時代各國之刑事制度，已非過去之報復王義，而着重於犯人之感化，使其覺悟，改過自新。此次國府於慶祝憲法成立紀念日頒布大赦令，其意義實屬重大，對於犯人之恩惠極厚，國家已予其更新向善之機會，希望囚犯於大赦出獄之後，養成良好的公民品德，為國家建設而努力。記者詢及地院上年度受理之案件數目，承吿上年度刑事案計受理二二·八三四件，民事案計七·八〇九件，民刑涉外案件的計七百餘件。檢察官會議　　〔本報訊〕地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，為商討國府頒布大赦令後，對舊案應如何辦理問題，特於昨晨召集全體檢察官朱錫瑜·季蘇·甘祟·周國瑛。丁同俊·劉用之·梁慶舜·吳啓華·顧宏標·楊守成·方正·郁懿新·全甸·張元鎭等十餘人會議。業徑正式決定，凡案情顯著在赦免範圍內者，一律暫停偵査，等待部令到後再行遵照辦理公訓同學勞軍　昨自南通反滬　　上海公調同學會代表三十七人，四日往南通向李默庵司令獻旗勞軍，由王曉籟任團畏，曾慶揖任總幹事，五日中午抵通·該地政治部主任李讓祺，會同當地紳士及軍樂隊等二百餘人，特在埠奏樂歡迎。該團上岸後，即至政治部略事休息，稍進茶點。旋李默庵司令蒞部，由曾總幹事分別介紹各代表後，即陪往參加新年軍民大會，主席李司令特致詞歡迎，代表團由王曉籟及代表胡西閱蔡仁抱先從致詞，吳人驥李玉書獻旗，並交上由各同業公會捐贈之勞軍物品名單，會畢，赴李司令邀請之座談會，由李司令報吿蘇北近狀，賀處長锄非加以詳細說明。李司令旋在新生活俱樂部設宴招待，八時宴畢返船，六日晨歸滬，隨船同往之各報記者及攝影記者十餘人，除一部份分往蘇北其他各地視察外，其餘亦原船歸滬。氣象預測　　西比利亞高氣壓中心在蒙古，籠單中國中部東部及東海，低氣壓於今日下午二時在北緯二十八度東經一百十七度，向東北東移動。　　天氣豫測：黃海，陰濛，局部　，淸勁東風，中浪。　　華中，陰濛，雨或霰，漸趨轉佳稍冷，中度北風。　　上海，陰濛，晨夕有霧，漸趨轉佳而冷，淸和東風至北風。　　東海，險，東南部曇，沿海雨或霧，淸勁東北風至東南風。中　　六日溫度：最高四八度，最低四二，七度。一一十四小時雨量〇，五耗（〇，〇二吋）</p>

經實行，東北與外國直接進口的口岸很多，所以也向中央請求這種辦法。最近經委會已經接到中央的批示，暫行直接辦理，由瀋陽中央銀行登記，以參酌目前柬北的需要，對自由貿易的人口商，稍予限制。　　王先生又說：輸出貿易一定要利用東北港口，規在出口貨物是先運往上海，然後出口，運費需要甚大，有時由上海到吳淞口以小船運到大船時的費用，較運往美國的運費還要多，所以現在國防部正商討開放東北商運的問題，如果大連不能利用，則一定要用葫蘆島，現在葫蘆島雖已開放商運，但沒有倉庫（原有倉庫現爲軍用），將來爲了便利商運，應當設立健全機構，專管商運事務，俾直接與國外發生貿易關係　　東北出口貿易的大宗貨物，除大豆外，還有猪鬃·煤·鐵·滑石·猪脂油和其他特產品等，這些也佔相當的數量。　　一篇細賬　　東北行轅經濟委員會主任張嘉激，除夕假私邸招待記者，縱談八個月來。東北經濟建設情形，他說：自從卅五年五月蘇軍撤退，中央開始接收以來，所得成果如下：　　鐵路　　（一）國有路通車路綫，五月份爲五六七公里，十二月份增爲二·五〇一公里。（二）中長路通車路綫，五月份爲三六八公里，十二月份六五八公里（三）國有路客運五月份六三六·三八七人，十一月份一·二五五·八八六人，貨運五月份一七五·一四二噸，十一月份四三四·四七六噸，（四）中長路客運五月份一五八·二六三人，十一月份八九七·八三〇人，貨運五月份一一·〇〇〇噸，十一月份一〇三·九三〇噸。　　電信　　電報電話：（一）通報通話綫路五月份一一·二〇〇對公里，十一月份一五·三六一對公里，（二）電信局五月份三八局，十一月份八五局，（三）電話用戶，五月份一六·八六七戶，十一月份二一·七九一戶，（四）市區電話，五月份十五市，十一月份二十一市。　　煤電　　（甲）煤，五月份產量一七二·〇五四噸，十二月份產量三一八·一七三噸，（乙）電力五月份發電量四〇·〇〇〇基羅瓦特，十二月份一八五·〇〇〇　羅瓦特。　　工廠　　復工工廠，資委會已復工十四單位，計劃復工者五單位，生產局已復工五十九單位，計劃復工七十七單位，瀋陽民營工廠一八〇廠。　　銀行　　銀行業務，七月份瀋陽有國家銀行六，商業銀行三十七，十二月份有國家銀行二十八，商業銀行六十五，銀行存款，七月份，國家銀行四億八千萬，商業銀行三億四千萬，十二月份國家銀行十八億八千萬，商業銀行十三億六千萬。銀行放款，七月份國家銀行一億一千萬，商業銀行一億九千萬，十二月份國家銀行六億二千萬，商業銀行八億，內國家銀行工業放款七月份增加七倍半，商業銀行工業放款七月份增加五倍。　　農業　　農產爲東北基本產業，生產多寡，關係民生甚大，本年農產耕地面積和收穫量，曾加以調查，在中央收復區，曾受各地兵災，治安影響，造成减少情形，尙不如預料之甚，去年耕地面積爲六·六九一·〇四四陌，本年爲六·三六七·四八〇陌，的爲百分之九十五，收獲量去年爲七·七三一·一九九公噸，本年六·八九六·九〇三公噸，約爲百分之八十九。　　物價　　關於物價和幣值，關係人民生活和人民心理，所幸物價與八·一五時相比較漲六倍餘，近數月來，尤見穩定，流通券一面開放工商匯款，由四聯分處審核准匯，一面中央銀行在山海關照公定行市公開買賣，黑市已消滅。　　關於經委會工作的進行順序，先求恢復經濟秩序，進而恢復經濟機能，經濟機能的重要部份，爲交通運輸，基本工業，金融機構，農業增產。　　交通運輸　　八·一五前，東北有車輛四萬餘輛，現僅有四千餘輛，祗十分之一，現在關內也須添置車輛，惟美國廠商表示須二年後交貨，因而補充十分困難，現正從事修理舊車工作，以渡難關。　　關於基本工業：明年擬增煤量至五百萬噸”本溪鋼鐵廠擬積極修復，先將現存原料四·五萬噸，製成成品，同時修滑鐵爐，熔鐵爐，計劃能產鋼二十萬噸，關於電量，擬自目前之十八萬基瓦增至二十萬基瓦。　　金融機構　　擬鼓勵各銀行多設分支行，並設立縣銀行，關於農業增產，擬與各省建設廳開會決定增產事宜，並爲防糧價與消費品價格相差太大，刻正由經委會研究對策，辦法是鼓勵農產品　人關內和國外。　　最後，他說：爲了挽救東北經濟危機，大家須有一個長時間的苦鬥，國家和人民，財力勞力完全集中於生產路途，纔有復興的希望。</p>

<p>香港歲寒图  十二月廿八日香港航戰　　英商務訪華團剛回去後，港中靈通消息人士一度盛傳宋院長行將來浦視察。現在事實證明了，來港的我方財政大員，不是宋院長，却是中央銀行總裁貝祖詒和英駕金融顧問羅傑士和其他經濟專家們。　　貝祖詒氏　來港任務之謎　　貝祖來港的任務，現已引起各方面的批測，有人說這與中英商約談判有關，也有人說這與國幣匯率改價有關，衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。貝氏接見記者時，祗說來港渡聖誕，別無其他任務、貝氏來港渡假而隨行的財政專家或要員計有十五人之多，怪不得各方面的推測，越來越勁。據經濟權威方面稱，貝氏此行主要工作，除視察中央銀行業務及整頓金融狀况外，厥爲：（一）推動出口貿易，（二）防止走私，（三）加强僑匯管理。　　貝氏於廿一日下午二時後抵港，港督楊慕騎當晚即在總督府設宴爲貝氏洗塵，傳貝氏將於廿三日與匯豐銀行總經理摩斯會談。中中交農四行定於廿日下午六時假座吿羅士打酒店九樓，爲只氏舉行盛大鷄尾酒會，招待本港各華資和其他外國銀行常事人，工商界領袖港府高級官員等。貝氏在港，將有一週的逗留。　　遊資逃港　月來貫有增加　　國內游資逃港，月來續有增加，初期每月逃港資金，的計國幣一百億元，最近已增至三百億元，今年下半年逃港資金的總數，的計一千億元以上，身爲中央銀行總裁的貝氏，常然不會忽視這個嚴車問題。但欲澈底制止國內游資逃港，必須取得港府的合作，貝氏不遠千里而來，這當爲其中原因之一吧。　　我國財政當局的措施，往往以上海爲軸心，而忽視香港的特殊性。香港的經濟與國內同源，但其直接的控制者却是倫敦政府。國內的游資到了香港便可套取外匯。國內限制外貨進口，香港便變爲一個走私中心，國內禁紗出口，國內統制外匯，僑匯便轉來香港，香港便採辦日紗應市。……因爲這種反作用的存在，時間愈久，則影響愈大，我們便不得不亟亟找尋補救的辦法了。　　訪華團長　稱日紗將運港　　英商務訪華團團長鮑埃斯爵士，曾向港商演說，英國決盡最大努力以工業原料供應港中工廠之需。　氏聲稱：由港府由東京盟軍總部接治結果，日輪一艘業已載有日紗二百萬磅，由日本首途來港，預料月底或下月初即可抵達。全港大小織造廠五百餘家，每月約需棉紗六十四萬磅，故首批日紗可供三月之用。港府已向織造商保證，繼續供給棉紗，至少以半年爲限。日紗每包成本値國幣八十萬元，滬紗現値二百萬元以上。那對滬紗前途有何影響，不問可知。目前港中花布，價格火跌，每碼僅售一元半至二元半。日紗抵港後，勢將更爲便宜，屆時，國內市塲將充斥由日紗製成的香港棉品織了！　　展望前途　港商多抱樂觀　　香港商界領袖展望一九四七年的前途，多抱樂觀。據他們檢討所得，約有下述數端：　　附載汽車的渡輪，往來於港九兩岸間　（本報香港特約記者子健攝）　　（一）香港因淪陷數年，外貨來源停滯，故勝利後，先到之舶來品備受搶購，均獲意外龐大之利率，然此是不正常之狀態，決不能持久者。　　（二）有種商人以爲可獲厚利，故紛紛大量定購，造成供求不均之象，致貨價日見低跌。　　（三）因戰後運輸船舶來去不定，迦以工潮頻頻發生，供應若斷若續，時而大量湧到，時而久候不來，業出入口者無法預算，羸虧歷定。　　（四）此種情形是戰後畸形狀態，將來貨價必能漸趨合理水準，而船舶往來亦當日趨正常，則商人雖不如以往驟獲暴利，然營業可能有預算有一定之利率，營業將能達到健全，前途自可樂觀。　　（五）雖國內施行入口統制甚嚴，然其目的欲使人超不致逐次增高，是穩定國內金融經濟之對策，惟國內必需物品須靠外貨輸入者仍多……。　　然而悲觀論者也有他們的理由：他們舉出最近三個月的香港出入口數字，證叫香港貿易已漸减的趨勢：　　這前後三個月間，入口貨物减少三千萬元，出口貨物减少一千四百萬元，各行生意因此日形冷淡。　　春季馬票　遲來即告向隅　　市上和平時一樣的沉寂，商人祗好寄希望於來日。港府的財政預算也呌不景氣，立法局通過徵收飲食稅（十分之一）增加烟酒稅，徵收物業買賣稅後，最後又傳考慮徵收舞稅，因此，不僅商人渴望早日繁榮，就是政府也急急期望早日繁榮呵！　　這幾天來，恰恰和一般的商號相反，香港馬會的出售馬票處，却擠擁異常。定期明年一月十四日開獎的春季馬票，現已售出三十萬條以上，遲來向隅，誰不想作一九四七年的當爲呢！經過這一年，香港的復員工作，什九已吿完成。美輪美奐的半島酒店，門前的汽車又見徘列成行，回復當年景象。附載汽車的渡輪，早已往來港九兩岸，而日軍遺留的醜惡紀念品「忠靈塔」，現已招商拆除。匯豐銀行門前兩隻大銅獅也從日本運回原有的石基上，香港外表的創痕，似已大體洗脫了，現在一般的注意力，却在看看如何渡過牠的蕭條時期，而轉上繁榮之路。附載汽車的渡輪，往來於港九兩岸間（本報香港特約者子健攝）東方花園式都市　福州即景  十二月廿八日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予　　記者於聖誕前夕自滬飛抵福州，抵達福州市空時，以機輪轉動失靈，幾肇大禍，卒於高空盤旋數匝後冒險降落，僅受震甚劇，幸無出事。機降福州郊外義嶼機塲，　市區約十餘里，在崎嶇的公路上驅車駛入城內，記者闊別故鄕七戰，今重睹閩中父老兄弟，不無感慨。　　社會經濟　　福州於抗戰過程中，先後於卅年，三十三年二度淪陷，雖敵人盤據時間甚暫，而物資則爲搜括一空，糧食允然，三十年間敵人退出福州後，台灣敵電台廣播敵人並未破壞福州而自動撤退，實在，福州市區內建築並沒有受到什麼摧殘，但是，敵人去後，福州接着受到空前的糧食恐慌，餓莩載道，福州人記憶猶新，福州本來糧食不能自給，仰賴於閩北及南洋洋米的接濟，論工業，也只有工藝品的製造，許多的日用品皆賴上海的輸入，又何能經得起敵偽二度的洗刦，所以，形成今日物資枯竭的局面。　　去年十一月省府還治福州後，福州人口激增，跟着物價飛騰，戰後沿海航運尙未恢復到戰前狀態，福州的輸出貿易也多少受着運輸上的限制，而且，在今日外貨傾銷聲中，整個民族工業窒息，入超日形嚴重，又豈限於福州的輸出貿易呢？福州手工業如漆器向馳譽於國內外，曾得美國芝加哥展覽會的獎賞，而今也感到銷路困難。福州沒有證券交易市塲，沒有大資本家的瘋狂投機，福州的黃金美鈔也不是以領導物價，那末物價的高漲是完全受供求律的支配是極其明瞭的，與上海比，情形比較單純。物價一漲，首當其衝的是持貨幣固定量收入的公敎人員，福州照中央薪津支給標準是列入第四級（最近調整已升格爲第三級），甲級公敎人員支薪僅得十餘萬元之譜，面對八萬元一担的白米如何仰事俯蓄呢？　　記者遇及友人，無不痛談物價高漲生活受到壓迫之苦，然以上海初來的記者，不無輕鬆之感，無論如何百物價格（除洋貨別論外）的指數是比上海低，生活程度則比上海稍高。　　政情一斑　　首先談到徵兵一事：福州一般老百姓習慣上不說徵兵，而說「拉壯丁」，可見老百姓的心理了，據聞福州市府尙未正式頒發徵集壯丁的命令，而區公所乃至保甲長已經開始「強拉壯丁」了，甚至有血案的造成，壯丁未出徵先掛彩，給福州市民作街頭巷尾的評論，福州輿論界爲此對當局抨擊甚力，聞發生血案的大橋區區長已撤職查辦，受傷的二名壯丁已送公立醫院醫治中，這種事件的發生誠屬不幸，且足以造成徽兵工作的困難。另而，冒名頂替的事也層出不窮，壯丁身價已突破百萬元大關，與廣州壯丁的身份可以媲美了，聞保甲長且有非法挨戶攤派壯丁安家費，數額之多寡，由保甲長酌情定之，以贈送志願者之家屬，此事聞市府當局已注意中。徵兵一政，在我國實行歷史甚短，而流弊則層出不窮，老百姓風聞徵兵，類皆杌隉不安，揆其原因，不外是辦理役政人員未能善盡職責，旣不按照兵役「三平原則」辦理，又不能予徵集入營之壯丁以安適的生活，優待其家屬使無後顧之憂，何能怪壯丁之逃役？　　娼妓與跳舞在福州，在現行法令上，仍在禁止之列，惟地下活動爲勢披猖，不久前，市府曾有開禁之擬議，後遭婦運會之反對而作罷，惟據有關方面表示：如澈底禁止娼舞，則此大批之妓女與歌女，生計將無法維持，更造成社會不安狀態，且若輩所受暗中之剝削更爲厲害，與其做暗盤生意，莫如讓其公開營業，市府也可在萬份拮據市自治財政中向舞男嫖客取到一筆經費—一個可靠的稅源爲何不知開闢呢？記者向友人言：爲整頓頹風，政府而行禁娼禁舞，原無不可，但是，禁了後呌她們向那裏討飯吃呢？政府又沒有許多生產機構讓她們去做直接的生產，於是，她們還不是偸偸摸摸地操其舊行業。　　「嚴懲貪汚，整肅官常」，這是舉國上下一致的要求，可是，在高喊檢舉貪汚的聲中，貪汚者仍然吾行吾素，與爾何干？福州不久前發生了利用職權，以公濟私的糧食舞弊案，民政應長高登艇及有關官史下了台，算是了結，近來，又發生了二椿舞弊案，福州新聞界加以揭發，其一是市府敎育科長許元培的貪汚凟職的嫌疑問題，事緣為其父治喪收受僚屬的餽贈，似有超過了友誼的限度，據說監察機關已派員澈查中，其一是市府稅捐征收處以處長楊東麟為首的集團大舞弊案，沒有佐證者有六百萬元之矩，在偵查中尙有千餘萬元之款，全案已由市府派員澈查中。　　福州風光　　約有四十多萬人口，集中在這「東方花化園式都市」的福州，福州文風甚盛，子弟皆以讀書爲無上光榮，敎育亦見發達，院校有三，中學林立，且多規模龐大，章上於途中可見莘莘學子着制服三五成陣快步上學，敎會在福州勢力甚大，福州較具規模之學府類皆敎會學校，如協和大學，英華，格致，三一中學皆是，孕育過不少人才。福州有日報六家，週報三種，雜誌以改進出版社及省立研究院所出版的數種爲佳，一般而有，福州中等敎育非常發達，高等敎育則有待擴充，蓋因福州子弟多於中學卒業後負笈北方或來滬求學。文化則　向凋敝，文壇貧之，此或因文人生活之艱難與出版事業壓於高物價之下無法抬頭。　　福州風光明媚，景色盎然，　江橫貫於前，三面繞山，保有純樸之古風，金石字畫福州人士每累代相傳，視爲塊寳。經書史乘，作爲家庭課本，福州方言，自成一系，外地人初到福州，最感不慣者即語言上之隔閡，相傳福州之方言，乃我國最早之語言，宋前江南各地皆用之，後我漢族別支之　家，福佬，　族等族目海上佔入福州，把他們的語言滲透入福州的語言，而形戚福州今日的方言。徴諸史乘，班斑可考。　　福州瀕海邊，出閩江口即東海，水路交通北上二日半可抵上海，南下一日可抵厦門，陸路有福　幹綫一日可抵厦門，此綫戰時破壞現在分期修築中。閩西北各地的木材·茶葉·香菰·水菓·紙·筍的輸出，上海洋貨的輸入皆以福州爲吐納口，福州南台面臨閩江，乃貿易中心，一如上海的外灘。戰後金甌無缺的香港快活谷跑馬廳（特的記者子健攝）台東行（四）　花連港  廿三日台北航訊　本報特派員江暮雲　　花蓮港—東台灣第一都市，新興的海港都市。東台灣，一般地槪括了台東，花蓮港，蘇澳，宜蘭。台東，花蓮港是兩個縣，蘇澳，羅東，宜蘭現在屬於台北縣，在本島的東北部地方人士現在正醖釀着復舊：恢復縣治。就台東和花蓮港而論，花蓮港實在比台東繁榮，鬧猛，台東是沉沒在沙漠裏的寂寥之都，黃昏街上就沒有人，爲燈的火炬發着暗澹的光，白天海風刮着風沙，滿是灰塵；花運港則像是披上了近代文明都市的外衣，低矮的房舍雖保留了三十年前的豐韻，但海港的繁榮，使它直接承受了島內外洪流的冲瀲，它還年靑！　　當地的人們，會把三十年前的凄凉景象（那時名筑陽）和現在作對比，那時是太平洋邊岸一個荒邱，二三十戶疏落的小村；卅年後的現在却具備了都市的雛形，儼然是東台灣的第一都市，花蓮港人是足以此自傲的。　　大山脈　　蘊藏山林礦產　　張文成縣長和縣轄的　　鐸給視察團安排了一個日程和舒適的住所，花蓮港的旅舍比台東多，還保持了純日本風味，供過路旅客憇息，常貴賓汽油車駛入車站時，我們便聽到了爆竹聲，成行列的歡迎代表在夜的街頭列隊以迎，我們之中，都深感不安，眞有像威爾　到重慶大歡迎時一樣的心情。　　張縣長說，因爲電信的不能暢通，早在兩天前便準備了，方在今天能接到。他很詳盡地吿訴我們以花蓮港的現况。他說給海港最大的打擊的是三十三年的大轟炸。這裏盛產着砂金地下有五十尺深的含金層，有水銀，石綿，石灰，大理石，不必仰求西部的煤礦，有百分之八十以上的林野，用之不盡的製材，有正在復興中的糖廠。　　縣府和台東一樣，三十六年度的預算十分之四要求省助，較本年度减縮了一千九百萬，縣長希望配合着其他各部門來建設農田水利，建設交通，他更希望某種事業，縣能做的交給縣辦，縣沒有力量辦的由省辦。　　背負着海港約有標高數千尺的大山峯三十二座，南湖大山，中央尖山，北合歡山，　萊主山，能高山，安東軍山，圓大山，秀姑蠻山等，全縣有十四萬人，五萬多高山族散處於平野和山間。這些散處在山間的高山族，他們愛以野火燒山，森林遭殃，所以陳長官特別交任處長帶了手諭，着嚴令禁止。縣長和我們所持有的見解一樣，東台灣不是農業，商業地帶而是天然條件具備的工業地帶。　　寄航地　港口亟需搶修　　日本人把地處米崙平野的花運港誇爲世界無比的掘入式港灣。在蘇花公路沒有開築以前，進出口貨物年達八萬噸以上，結果在民國二十年由日本政府撥款七五〇萬開始興建，二十八年十月完成。後來台東到花蓮間的鐵路也自花蓮市區向北延長到港埠，完成了海陸聯運，每年進出口貨物達二十萬噸。到二十九年再決定以五百萬預算擴充港埠，三十四年受了戰事影響，便陷於停頓。道個港口，完全是人工開鑿的小港，鑽深達十五公尺，東西兩座防波堤左右圍抱成外港，內港呈矩形，面積有七萬平方公尺的停泊之所，水面流速每小時的二千三百公尺，因爲年久失修，原先作爲寄航地，可以停泊三千噸級的輪船。現在基隆港務局花蓮分局正計劃着將六公尺水深加鑿到七·五公尺，同時修建燈塔，浮標和購置三十噸重的起重機，使具有一百萬噸的裝卸能力。目前該局最着重的是搶修東防波堤，今年五月間將被颱風波浪冲擊的部份趕修時，不意在完成時再度遭遇風災，堤身迎受最兇猛風浪部份被冲壞七十餘公尺，他們已決定製作大混凝土塊及搶修堤身爲明年度的中心工作，需要水泥六千噸，合價一千萬元台幣。該局很鄭重的指出，要是明年不能完成，再遭颱風災害的話，花蓮港將如夢幻蓮花似的完了！　　視察團得到　隆港務局長徐人壽和唐船長桐蓀的照顧，特用了該局的汽輪，給我們巡視港埠一週。恰巧從日本來的二千七百噸的L．S．T．停着，裝運二百六十多名的日僑返國。兩點在飄，浪濤大作，我們便離船在防波堤上稍爲察看，急待修復的情景，已是有目共覩的了。　　移民村　示範農塲巡禮　　日本人三十年前便有這樣的計劃，使合灣成爲日本人的台灣，而土着的世代生息於斯的台灣人，移植到南洋和其他各地去，台東官營移民村的設置就是這個意思。他們以台東花蓮港爲試騐地，由此而擴展到中部平原，早先便擇定了十五個村落，作爲收容之地。　　這個有計劃的純侵略味的移民，日本政府給予他們以莫大的便利。在政府機構中，特別設立了事務所，負監督獎勵自治訓練的責任，政府給予他們以官有地耕種，龐大的經費，村落　設備了托兒所，學校，醫院，會堂，合作社和一所理想的住宅，改善他們的生活，獎勵他們捕魚和集團自耕農移民，使經營科學化，管理合理化。境內吉野，豐田，林田，瑞穗四移民村，成績卓著，而吉野村更譽之爲模範村，這四村的總人口二七〇五人，五八五戶，全面積四萬一千九百餘畝，佔全縣面積百分之十點二。　　光復後農林處把他們接收過來，改爲示範農塲，現在種作着連作作物水稻，輪作作物甘蔗，烟草和甘諸，有甘藉，咖啡，加工工廠，精米廠，其農產的總收入佔全縣產量百分之十。示範農塲現在正期待着能採取集體耕作的辦法，因爲耕地平坦，採取大農經營制度，使用機器耕種，生產效率可以增高，也能適合於粗放的條件。　　鋁鎳廠　亟待從速復工　　花蓮有幾個工廠，較著的是鋁和鎳工廠。地方人士目前最感杞憂的是政府要將這兩個廠搬走，同時要把發電七萬六千K·W·現在僅能消耗二千多的電力設備移到福建去。這個電力設備，當初却完全爲了供應兩個廠，尤其是戰時工業的鋁，便需要三萬六千K·W·的消耗。　　港口的雨，帶有寒意的，我們仍照着預定的計劃去參觀.資本六億日元的鋁廠在港邊，過去日本人從馬尼刺運來砂塊，到這裹和高雄提煉着鋁，一噸鋁砂，通過電的分解，可以煉四十公斤鋁，一架飛機城一噸半的鋁。據說該廠每月生產量是二尤噸，記者在這個廠裏走馬看花了一下，滿目凄凉，幾乎是一片焦土，盟機的雷達沒有把它放鬆過，電解部份，水泥和炭塊，零亂的散着，雨水浸着。變壓器，大型的孤光整流器，都被炸得支離破碎。資源委會已決定了和加拿大鋁廠合作，而用全力先將高雄廠復工，花蓮港是準備放棄了。記者們都以爲　　這個　　　　　宜於花運　境的水產學校，倒是挺理想的，因爲這裏正面對着太平洋暖流的漁港。　　地下物　含鐵礦質最豐　　不久前本省曾傳說在台東發現煤　，可供開　，但後經本省地質調查所前往調查，證明所謂煤層者，僅爲埋賊於礫層中的一些已經炭化了的木塊而已，據該所所長畢慶昌對記者談起關於東台灣的地下資源，他說現在已經知這的，有天然氣（瓦斯），砂金與含　礦物三種，茲的略加以報道於後：　　在台東縣城之南郊及海岸山脈的南段，均各有若干天然氣的宣洩，上升的氣體，且有造成泥火山的，天然氣的本身固是一種燃料，但所以能引起人們的注意，實在因爲有可能在它下面發現石油、台灣產天然氣的地方很多，據多年探勘的結果，下層未必一定含有石油，由於東台灣緊依絕不能儲有石油的變質岩所造成的中央山脈，向東就是太平洋，加以海洋山脈的構造很複雜，所以地質條件比西部更不利，現在我們雖不能絕對否認，它是一個可能的油田，但是倘說要加以注意的話，只怕在本省中是最末一位了。　　關於東台灣的砂金多產在中央山脈的東坡，而以花蓮港縣境內的中央山脈中比較多。砂金通常多產在礫石所構成的較古的台地中，這種台地在山裏的分佈很廣，在七八年前有一個技師曾根據比較雜藏豐富的部份來推論全體，估計了一個驚人的藏金量，因此這個技師頓時像一個英雄似的，成爲前台灣總督小林　造的上賓。但到後來發現山中台地並不全是含有高度的含金率，幾乎鬧了一個大笑話。此後雖然沒有能得到比較準確的估計，但已經可以相當至多不過是一種普通的砂金礦床而已。因爲目下交通困難，一時還沒有開發的可能。　　東台灣的含鎂礦物，包括蛇紋石，橄欖石，綠泥石，白雲石，及石綿等。自蘇澳以至台東沿中央山脈及海岸山脈均有出產。已經具有經濟價値的，僅有花蓮縣豐田的石綿，現在因爲在製造化學肥料的過程中須用鎂素，而肥料則爲今後台灣最需要的東西，因此蛇紋石等亦將爲足以利用的東西。台灣的含鎂礦最近經地質調查所在全島普查的結果，以東台灣儲量最多，對於肥料製造的需要，是足可供應不虞匱乏的。半島酒店門前，汽車又排成長蛇陣了。（特約記者子健攝）福州鼓山風景——松陰道中（本報福州特派記者陳正予寄）周小燕女士近影演唱神妙·勝似國際演說家　化身千百·發為英法德語音　馳訪歌壇學者周小燕女士　巴黎留學界中一名妹  十二月廿一日巴黎航訊　本報巴黎特約記者宏員　　巴黎留學界，俱稱小燕女士之善歌，予因藝苑名流社交領袖之紹介，訂期的晤，遂以三時三十分許，馳訪璇居，女士鬢擁鳥雲，御黑色之西衫而略施朱綵，不更如良宵勝會之外加中國繡『團花嚴海』圖案短披風，女士生長漢皋，操北平上海語，莫不流利，周知法義英德諸國言文，壁縣蕭凌孝隱夫人繪坐像，妙肖逼眞，日影在窗，茶香盈儿，淸詞風發，妙緒環生。　　女士之尊人，初爲大銀行家，今任聯合救濟總署長，夙嗜音歌，力宏聲敎，家有三妹在國內，均　於榮，二弟一留內省，不幸於戰期捐軀，又一偕行來海外，旅法逝世，謂家母心甚憂傷，恒藉『無父之子皆我子』一念以自慰。　　至於音樂，我中國則人才多而機會絕少，國內各地，聽好音樂之機會更少，非若歐洲接境諸邦之使於相互求學，彼意學問之道欲深造，有三要件，不可或缺，一天才，二環境，三則工夫。第三要件，即謂凡事之求進步宜用功。本人上年十月國慶，曾到柏林演唱三次，第一次華人集會，由中國駐德軍事團繆參事培　主席，此後在Renaissance　Theater復典戲院，舉行個人音樂會，兩次皆客滿，德人對於音樂嗜之深，寗可使腹餓，而却不可缺此精神之食糧，此後在柏林無綫電台廣播一次，旋取德報論評見示，如云：『女士此唱，深深打入聽衆之心渦。』如云：「女士所唱各國文歌曲，字音之凖且淸，甚可誇異。』　　天才高音調清　　予因詢女士何以所唱英法德義諸語調，均能曲盡其妙？女士答稱：每習一國語言之歌詞，恒請此一國之人爲師，同時兼授言語課，且研誦報端文字，例如義國古典派西曲義文題Chi　vuol　la　Zirogarella譯以華文，即爲「何人悅此流浪女」？歐洲流浪民族Tzingari居處無定，大抵鬻技爲生，有類中國人之走江湖。又如英古典派西曲Zymphs　and　Shepherds即謂水上靈妃與牧童。又如德浪漫派西曲，乃自成一「體」（style）之虛白氏Schubert名作，德文題Wohinp之間，即謂「去何之」？又法新派西曲Colibri命題，即華文之「蜂雀」。一一道來，如數家珍而均得釋其字義，詳其本源，演唱時化身千百，發爲各國語音，善顯神奇，慣施狡獪，勝於第一流國際演說大家，自是我中華天造地設之對外宣傳健將，不僅足顯炎黃　胃天分之特高。　　蚌殼曲訴哀情　　至若家蕭子昇法文原作，而由俄人齊沛霖A．Tcherepnine演為法國典之蚌壳精下凡二十載別夫远逝一幕哀情。大指谓某甲務農，久爲獨身男，誠實而勞苦，三餐恒自炊，一日返舍飯已熟，似有人代煮，次日亦然，異而跡之，乃知每日有蚌壳精，化爲少女潛入其室善其事，心悅之而匿其殼，蚌壳精不得通，王帝乃許暫　此田舍漢為妻，偶合之姻緣，以二十年爲限，法國曲所演奏，正叙此一雙男女綠滿欲別之情，故其詞哀，其聲沈抑，蕭君草此，意在向世界各地，宣傳中華農國人民忠勤好和平之優良天性，唱來尙是西音，其以中國曲人四式　譜，而仍有東方韻味，足顯一　國之特性者，則以雲南山歌Chanson　Routiere爲最動聽，女士每唱此曲，座中男女西賓，　環請再唱一次，予詢每唱必兼中外諸曲之理由，女士答曰：我一方唱西歌，又一方面必向聽衆，介紹幾個中國歌。此舉不僅蘭揚國光，實欲使中西藝術，打成一片，破除外國人以中國爲太荒遠之售觀念。中國固有之音樂，比諸西樂，終覺其太簡單並太疏淺，西方香樂，每有抑揚nuance，而中國戲台鑼鼓，只是雜聲，萬萬比不上兼具鑼鼓之西方交響樂隊。又凡藝術，不足昭示一國之特性者無價値，世界是每日進步，中國須與之俱進，須與西方各國，同站在一條綫上，不進則退，勢所必然。例如俄國，其先慣彈斯烈夫族流浪北大陸之江湖琴balalaika，今亦改用世界文藝大一統之鋼琴，我今恪循各國通行之樂律，採取較有價値之中國歌，給西人聽，俾不至如歷來西人看到中國戲之情同看把戲，俾不至如西人無以了解中國事物時之只有驚奇而不能評判，蓋凡無關痛癢之詞，縱使博得好評，不免近於欺騙，演唱者自以爲好之好，更是欺己而又欺人，必使西人聽了中國歌，同時又聽外國歌，乃能了解，乃易評判。　　在倫敦耀聲光　　女士於本年三四月間，曾至倫敦，在白廈鐵院White　Hall　Theatre演唱，並不曾灌製留聲機片，俾向太平洋方而廣播，厥後八月一日，復應聯合國科學文敎總會之請，專程前往德，比，法交界地之螺堡Luxembourg國演唱，此誠學者藝術家對外耀聲光之破題兒第一遭，其在預約中者，有一九四七年二月二十五日舉行於巴黎之音樂大會，及三月間倫放方面耳目並用用之　視television播音，女士博聞好學，法文之造詣尤深，如謂曲譜法文題Ombres　chinoises中國影子戲即指定馬燈。，深見才長心細，即賦贈一詩如下：『曉日崇樓燕，高風上苑鶯，博聞眞好學，愛國見多情，　　傳刋遍，腴談滿座傾，　　彰泰運，　縵本天成。』</p>

<p>婦女與家庭每星期二出版婦女的道路  王新　　有的歷史家說，上古時候爲母權社會。倡導婦女解放運動的女鬥士，往往也據此爲理由，想恢復母權，至少也應做到男女平等的地步。我對於上古時候爲母權社會，却發生了懷疑，依我看來，上古時候並沒有夫婦關係，而和現在的哺乳動物差不多。於是也就談不到「母權」和「社會。」不過當時子女由母親單獨撫養，那時母親的負祖更比現在艱重而已。後來大概人類漸漸進步，漸漸社會化，於是由個人而家庭，而部落，而國家，而現在的國家集團，將來也許要進步爲人類大集團，由此看來，人類是一天比一天團結，一天比一天親密了。　　我們旣然都屬於人類當然所有的人都應該一律平等。自然界使我們有男女之別，因此人類的生活更加美滿。男女除掉生理上稍有不同外，原是同樣的人。但就因爲有了這一點兒生理上的差異，於是在責任上男女也就顯然不同了。男女結婚以後，生活怎樣解決？由於種種關係，這個責任當然應該委在男子的肩上，女人雖然有謀生的力量，可是家裏的各種事務，總不可以沒有人去管理。尤其重要的，如果有了孩子以後，敎養孩子的重大責務當然是人做母親的去負。也許有人這樣說：可以用奶娘，請家庭敎師。費用且不談，然則我們難道不可憐人家的孩子嗎？—人家的母親被我們的孩子奪了—這也不談，我們難道放心嗎？我們難道不願爲自己的孩子，盡母氣的天職嗎？由於以上種種原因和女人的天性，女人是宜於而且必須處理家務的。但我並不是說女人，就祗限於處理家務，在女子未結婚甚至未生育之前和停止生育以後，可能的話，也應該可以踏進社會。如果女性當中有非凡之才，自不妨犧牲家庭幸福，去謀人類的福利。女性而做了大科學家，大政治家，甚至是大總統，男子自也同樣敬服的。　　職業是無分貴賤的。並不是服務社會的就高貴，處理家務就低賤我們創造出美滿的家庭，這也是一種光榮的事業。我們帮助丈夫的事業成功，也是一樣地偉大。我們敎養兒女，使他們有强壯的身體，並且有禮貌，講道理，肯用功，將來成爲偉人，我們的功勞將永遠不會磨滅。希望大家都以孟子的母親，歐陽修的母親爲楷模。必要時我們也得做木蘭第二，費宮人第二。中外歷史上內助和母敎的偉大是永遠令人起敬的，願大家起來發揚光大。　　總之，男女祇應該合作，男子不應該壓迫女子，女子也不要想尅服男子，各有各應盡的義務。如果和敵國交戰起來，男子一定是衝先鋒的，但做看護就是我們應盡的義務。看護和鬥土不是一樣的神聖嗎？　　好像叔本華說過：「一男一女才是個完人」。所以男女是缺一不可的。男女都應該立即拋棄異已的觀念，而互相尊重，互相帮助，共同完成人類的使命。怎樣為孩子補已習  流雲　　在上海有好多受過敎育的父母，對自己子女的敎育頗爲關心，不但議子女在學校受敎而已，還要督促他們在家補習，這原是為父母者對子女敎育上的盡責，但若補習不得其道，其結果必無成效，倒是不可不注意的。筆者曾任小學敎師十一年，時作家庭訪問；現在自己的孩子也正在號讀，雙方兼顧，便體會到應怎樣爲孩子補習的方法，略述如左：　　應予遊戲時間：補習時間，最好在晚飯或早飯前，時間也不宜太久，至多一小時。有些父母呌孩子放學回家，便從事補習，實爲不智。那不但剝奪敢孩子遊戲時間，阻礙身子發育，且影響其腦力無休息機會。　　講解不必詳盡：有些父母為孩子補習，把日間所授課本，一一詳解，其實大可不必。反養成孩子在校不再留心聽講，以爲總有父母再敎授的機會。其實補習者，只補敎其所不明瞭處，複習更正其錯誤處而已！　　逗引孩子興趣：筆者以為求學之進步，端在乎興趣，所謂循循善誘，即啓發兒童對各科之興趣也。孩子怕習算術，父母可以日常應用題呌他習作；孩子不會作文，可買些兒童讀物給他閱讀：如此他對算術國文漸生興趣，其進步自速！　　多獎勵少訓斥：所謂獎勵，並不是以物質表示只是言語也好，比如今天的字比昨天寫得好，今天的書比昨天唸得熟，少有臻進，便予嘉許，自然會引起他的向上性；若一味說這字不好，那文不通，徒使孩子灰心意懶，不進而反退了。　　最好勿請敎師：有人特地另請家庭敎師，專爲孩子課後補習，其實並非善法。因當家庭敎師，多爲酬勞而來，自思並非學校敎師，似乎可不負責任，敷衍時間而已。而在孩子方面對家庭敎師，也以爲我不懂，你該吿訴我，甚至明天的功課要求代爲做好。在雙方如此情形之下，與補習二字，原意已錯，還有好結果麼裝飾與個性  朱恆如　　我常常冷眼旁觀許多女子的裝飾，她們似乎不管自己的身材是矮胖的還是瘦長的，也不顧自己的年齡正是一個十七八歲的小姑娘，或者是一個三十歲的少婦，以至於是一個四十歲的徐娘，她們都一意地跟隨着時代流行的裝飾，來打扮自己；腦額上捲着像小麵包一般的一個髮卷，嘴唇上和指甲上都塗着攻瑰色的口紅和寇丹，身上都穿着那些聳着肩膀闊袖，和領子向外翻轉一塊的外套，手腕上挾着玻璃皮包，脚上也穿着玻璃皮鞋，除了極少數的女子是例外，差不多裝飾得都成爲同一典型，眞所謂「千篇一律」着。因此使我懷疑到世界上對裝飾美最不注意個性的女子，莫非就是我們中國女子麼？　　其實裝飾和個性是有着極密切的關係，每一個女子都應該有自知之明，自己的個性，終究屬於那一種？嬌嫩的，雅靜的，恬淡的，還是妖艷的。自己究竟是適合濃裝呢？還是淡裝呢？在未爲自己設計打扮之前也該有一個深切的認識。同時還該注意到髮型和面部美容的相配，服裝和身材的適合，服裝的色彩和皮膚，髮色，年齡的調和，關於這些都必須經過一番細心的研究。例如就我的經騐來說：瘦長的人不宜穿直條子的衣服；矮胖的人不宜穿橫格子的衣服以及齊膝的短旗袍。頭髮黃色，皮膚白晳的人不宜穿黑色的衣服，相反的，頭髮黑色皮膚也黑的人該穿五顏六色花衣服最爲合適。臉蛋短或橫闊的人，不宜留前劉海，在臉部的兩旁却須留些頭髮，以掩蔽那闊度。頭部較小的人儘量地把頭髮向上梳，讓臉部整個的顯露出來。然後再觀察時下所流行的那一種髮型和服飾是最適合於自己，再決定取捨，採用一種最能表現自己特殊個性的裝飾來打扮自己。如果那些洗行的裝飾裏。竟沒有一樣是適合自己個性的話，寗可保持本來自已所用的老式樣，不爲爲了學時髦，專事盲目地仿效，反而把自己打扮得矯揉造作，顯得異樣地不自然。　　總之，一個女子的裝飾，必須憑着各人天生的資質，去分別配合，那末纔能看來很自然，很和諧，很適意，而且很美麗；要知道，女子的裝飾美也是一種深奧的藝術呢。瞎眼奶  吳宛華　　希望未來的母親們注意！　　我二十歲結婚，到現在已經有兩年了。去年的一月裏，我生下第一個男孩，當這孩子誕生以後，立刻使我担心起來：因爲我的乳部從幼受着先天發育不健全的影響，直至產後仍舊沒有奶頭（俗稱瞎眼奶），這呌孩子怎麼能够吸呢？後來據一個鄰居的婦人吿訴我，女人的乳頭包藏在裏邊祗要大人來呼便可以突出來，於是我忍受了不少痛苦，淌了許多眼淚，由我的丈夫來吮吸，但結果一連呼了兩夜，奶頭幷沒有呼出，皮肉反而因為被牙齒擦傷而紅腫了。顯然我這雙奶是沒有希望了，可是孩子沒有奶怎麼可以過活呢？想僱個奶媽吧，我丈夫的收入又非常徵薄，平時生活已很勉强，當然不能再加上這筆負担。有人勸我用奶粉來哺孩子，可是我計算着一個月奶粉的代價，也不少於雇用一個奶媽，無可如何中，我每天改用稀薄的米漿米代替了乳，可是未滿一個月，孩子的面龐漸斬地變成一副瘦黃的樣子，額上也添了幾條縐紋，這使我和我的丈夫都焦急起來。後來終於把孩子寄奶到鄕下一個產婦那邊，我自己又託人介紹到學校衷去敎書，每個月的薪水，恰恰够付孩子的寄奶費。以後，隔三個月我趁星期日便下鄕去探視一次，到現在忽忽將近一年了。一年間孩子生過六七次小病，又因爲那產婦奶水不足，孩子依然消瘦的很，自己的孩子寄託給別人終是不放心的，所以我決定待年假後寗願辭了學校的敎職，把孩子領回來斷了奶，以後給他　一點粥和其他營養比較豐富的東西，也許要好一點吧。　　寫到這裏，使我想起一般跟我同樣乳部不健全的姊妹們，應該趁早請醫師想法治療，免得以後飽嘗痛苦，或使將來你的孩子健康發生問題。但乳頭是否有方法可以使其突出？這祗有請專門的醫師來解答了。乳兒的大便  甜風　　乳兒的大便，少有人注意，其實就養育上來說：非十分注意不可。因爲這時候小孩還不會說話，消化器的良好與吾，無從知道，除了觀察他的大便之外，其他方法殊少，現根據醫學上的說法來替他定一個可靠的查察乳兒的身體上有某種疾病，希望賢良的慈母時常借用這個方法來注意你們小兒的身體健康。下面幾種大便的顏色是乳兒的各種疾病。　　綠色便—受了驚嚇。　　白色便—受了寒。　　深黃色便—受了　。　　細末狀便—食傷。　　金黃色軟膏狀有酸性臭味的便—康健。鑑別牛乳  麥繼賢　　鑑別牛乳的優劣，最簡單的方法有下面數種：　　（一）盛水於碗中，取數滴牛乳滴入碗內，倘使立刻沉到永底去，這就是良乳，滴下時向水面擴散開來，這是劣乳。　　（二）瓶底有沉澱物發見者，是不良的牛乳。　　（三）將牛乳一滴放在手指甲上，倘使形成珠狀體的是良乳，不形成珠狀體而洗散，是劣乳。　　（四）把少量牛乳煮沸，陳舊腐敗的牛乳，往往發生凝固，新鮮的牛乳決不會凝固。洗衣機之模型（紐約時報）正視你的丈夫—給年青的新娘們—  良鴻　　　　是一個婚前幾經選擇而解驗過的丈夫，再無須什麼調查的必要，唯有我們信心地去跟從他——這種想念，也許是有相當眞理的。不過，婚前的眼光究竟是否正確，這倒尙須一番審察的必要。　　並不是要你去拆穿丈夫的短處，乃應去找出丈夫的優點。過去祗見些有相當距離的或自表面得來的外形，現在是近你的身邊來了，你不妨就直接的去探察他的內心。　　早知一日丈夫的特點，便能早有一日調和的生活。爲了這，你應不斷的把他來分析，隨時地把他來正視。這並不是揭穿他往事的意思。　　尤其是以小智慧的手段，專去肅淸他與女人間的關係，此實非你成功之良法。信念着，旣已與你婚了的丈夫，切莫拘泥過去的小事。要理解丈夫，法非在於找住丈夫的紐小的缺陷與失敗，乃是要更坦白地從正面去觀察之。　　關於丈夫的性格，志趣，經濟及其交際的範圍，事業的種類，從事的手法等等，你總要盡可能，早些明瞭。但你不可用偵探的方式去實施。因爲這非但使他會起憎惡之念，而且雙方互相誤解，亦就像妒嫉的荆棘似地，日長夜大的繁生起來。別偸偸摸摸的，要光明正大地，你須以公明的理智，富有愛情的去探索就好了。千萬不要追根問究時去麻煩他。坦白地，耐心地去努力於理解的追求吧！這不是一件如何煩難的事，祗要你能留神的話，決定能達到成功的目的哩！　　然則，反過來說，這樣，你的丈夫亦莫不細心的來注意你；溫柔的來愛惜你了。於是，一個快樂的家庭，就此向堅實之途高築起來了。　　丈夫不加正視；目光不放遠大，永遠祗沈溺於愛火情慾中的婦女們，不久的將來，你定會發現自己莫大的錯誤來。那時的阻難，失望，必引入你於幻滅的浪濤中。（節譯自日本式塲隆三郞氏「人妻之敎養」）</p>

<p>春秋	悔  匈牙利Karolyklsfaludi著　兪欣中譯　　雖然大地依舊是黝黯的，可是在一所著名的外科醫生診所前，已經有一個病人——據他自稱病勢是很嚴重的——心焦地等候着。　　在診所內，耀人眼目的燈光射在病人蒼白的面容上，他那憂鬱的神氣，顯示出他是有着一種難以告人的苦楚。他的右手是用綳帶包紥着，在他的嘴中不時發出幾聲煩惱的呻吟聲。　　「早呀！醫生。」他怪客氣地對醫生招呼了一聲，顯然他是一個上流人物：「在我的右手上，大槪是患了一種惡疾吧！它使我已有幾夜失眠了，並且現在病勢也比昔日沈重，它簡直不容我有片刻的舒適，假使如此下去，我担心它會使我發在。醫生，我求你替我驅除我的苦楚吧！」　　「你別害怕，我當然盡我的能力，絕不使你受到一絲痛苦。」醫生竭力地安慰他。　　「不，絕不，你一定要施手術的，否則它會使我更痛苦的。」病人用着堅定的語調，回答醫生。同時他用左手去解鬆綳帶，看來這是很費力的。　　在醫生診視後，不由使他詫異起來，原來他斷定病人的手，並無一點與平常人所不同的，但是病人的動作，絕對不像是僞裝的。　　「你那兒痛！」當醫生放下他的右手，瞧見黃豆般的汗珠，沿着面頰淌着，吃驚地問了一聲　　病人指着手上畫了一個圓圈，說道：「喏，魷在這二根筋脈之間，那處皮膚不是稍微有點發紅嗎？」　　醫生重新仔細地檢查過一次，徒然的，他又是失望了。　　「醫生，你不要再嚕囌了，總之，你只要替我將這塊肉割去，一直割到能够看見手骨爲止。」病人有點不耐煩了，憤憤地說道：「你瞧，手術完畢後，我允許給你一千元的報酬。」　　「哼！你當是那一類人物，就是你拿千萬倍的代價，我仍舊不肯在一個沒有患病的人肢體上，施行我的神聖工作。」醫生嚴肅地說道：　　「呃……」病人的臉上稍現出一絲躊躇的意志：「好，你旣然不允許我的要求，但是我也有方法的。」他脫去了西裝，捲起衣袖，又從衣袋中掏出一把鋒利的小刀，望了望醫生，勇敢地在手上劃了一刀，鮮血汨汨地湧着。　　「天啊！我將要違背良心了，請你饒恕我一次吧！」醫生悲哀地呌着，因爲他恐怕那個病人遭遇到不測的危險。　　在施行手術時，病人的臉上不時地流露出勝利的笑容，他的雙目，炯炯地望着那把利刃，在他的右手上不停地創刮着，可是他一點都不露出肌怯的樣子。直待醫生的工作完畢時，病人方才深深地歎了一口氣，彷彿是表示他已經脫離了苦海，永遠沒有那種痛苦了。　　「你還覺得痛苦嗎？」　　「不，現在我一絲苦楚都沒有了。」病人帶着愉快的笑意，滿足地說着。　　從此，醫生常常往他所住的旅社中去探間，逐漸地，醫生在他的口中知曉他是一個名土，有着良好的知識，及優良的德行。在他的刀創痊癒後，方才和醫生分別，回到鄉下的別墅去。　　一個月的光陰過去了，那個病人又在醫生的診所前徘徊着，他的右手又用綳帶包綁着，他的臉沒有一絲血色。　　醫生解開他的衣袖，已經尋不出那次的刀痕，僅剩下二條刀疤而已，可是他却似上次一般，索索地顫抖着。醫生在他請求之下，仍照着上次的方法，了結他的手術，不過這一次病人雖然也覺快樂，可是臨別時，却以憂鬱的口氣，替代了上决的笑容。　　二星期之後，醫生展開了一封那個病人寄來的信：——　　「親愛的醫生：　　我的創傷又復發了，它灼傷了我的心，使我不忍再在這世界上度我的殘生。……我知道你是不相信我是患病的，現在道件事情的眞僞，我也不願再瞞住你，總之，它還是由你去判斷吧！　　一年前，我與一個年靑和藹的少女結了婚。　　她是一個伯爵夫人的陪伴，那時我是一個愉快而滿足的人。……半年後，我不知怎樣竟會產生這種卑鄙可恥的念頭——是我疑惑她對於我的情感全是虛僞的——結果而釀成一個不幸慘劇。　　她有一具縫紉機，而縫紉機的抽屜，却終年鎖着，就是爲了這一件事，而使我常常窺視她的動作，那時我猜忌着，忖度着，懷疑着，迎她脈脈的眸子，親愛的擁抱，我都認爲是她對我一種敷衍的手段吧了！　　某日，伯爵夫人的她到她的府邸去。當她們剛乘馬車走出園門，我便開始了我的偵探工作，用盡心機，始打開縫紉機上的抽屜，在抽屜內，終於被我發現了秘密，有一束用紅緞帶繫住的信札，那可確定它是一束情書。　　在信中，充滿了使我發怒的話，並且每一封信的時間，都是在我倆結婚後來往的。閱畢，我仍舊照原樣放好。　　當晚，我假裝無事，佯爲　和她閒談，同進晚餐，及各人回到自己臥窒中去。　　慘事就在當晚發生了。　　在鴉雀無聲的夜深，我的理智被信中的毒素所征服，它使我躡着足走近她的身畔，那時我的心，我的血都好似火般地燃燒着，我的神志模糊得很，不由自主伸出右手，用力扼住她的頸項，鮮紅的血從她的唇舌內流出，一不留心，有幾滴血淌在我的右手上，這就是被你割剜的地方。翌晨，這塊血漬方被我發覺。……我草草地將她埋葬掉，發出訃告，以免使人生疑，此後我並不感到它的殘酷，祗知這是她應受的處置。　　在喪事的後幾天，伯爵夫人又來了，起先我料想她是知道我妻亡故消息的，可是等她聞得此件噩耗後，幾乎使她暈倒。待她神志淸醒時，她搜查着我亡妻的遺物，彷彿是在尋什麼重要東西，可是最後却使她失望了，還是當她臨別時，她方才告訴我，有一束信札寄存在我的亡妻處。唉！天呀！當她這幾句話傳進我的耳朶內時，不啻是枝利刃刺碎了我的心。原來我錯殺了妻，我覺悟了，可是那已遲了。　　自她走後，我的右手濺着的血漬處，好似有尖刺刺在那處一般，其實這僅不過是我的心裏作用吧了！可是我希望再痛點，所以到你的診所處受刀割的痛苦，讓它算我的粗莽及殘暴的懲戒。　　她不幸遭到了死亡，這全是我的錯誤，我現在無顏看見她的朋友，甚至是一切人，我祇願請求效饒恕，求她不要憎恨我，我要追隨她？……醫生　　再會吧！一個罪人絕筆」松壑雲蔭  張哲惠詩談片  林風　　詩不是壓榨出來的，不是模仿來的，不是單憑豪性率意寫出來的，不是喝幾杯酒一揮而就的，它是由於强烈的需求和自然的感召而產生的。有如熱透的果于要落地，向靜水投石就生出圓暈，用指撥琴就發出幽音，—只有在這種情形之下才能創作出好詩。夢外樓詩  徐澄宇　　將峽矣別蜀中故舊　　　昔避寇初，征途倉皇發，撈人問所之，西指黑水窟。顚頓人峽州，山勢龍虎蹶。拂衣白帝城，先與拜昭烈。想像翠微中，猶有杜陵宅。今古同一　，世變孰能說。栖遲南浦縣，如秦人入越。（二十七年秋入蜀居萬縣一年半）適有山中李，（重人）聞聲走相謁。論文或不媿，况與俗人絕。歲月胡可居，虜勢益猖獗。春棹更西征，眷茲巴子國。（二十九年春虜窺宜昌再走重慶）味薄南泉酒，（時任中央政校敎授，居巴之南泉）車淹沙坪轍。（三十年移講席於中央大學）間登歌樂山，歌聲振林樾。東望五溪雲，西瞻二峨月。　表憂國賢，簫管何時歇。飛寇日夕至，小民嗟白骨。上庠媿尸素，弦誦有時輟。斯文儻未墜，直探儒玄訣。平生伍夫子，海內擅名墨。西山共酬唱，會當金石勒。（伍非百邀予講學西山書院凡兩月）賀子（藏雲）亦矯矯，音制嚼冰雪。名言超玄著，或入晋賢列。此邦富才彥，江山靈未歇。即予及門士，亦堪勝流埒。陪都傳鄭賦，（資中鄭文著陪都賦）墨妙留王帖。（華陽王生工書）猗歟卿雲鄉，後起踵猶躡。豈知喪亂中，心魂此同悅。無何妖寇淸，助順有回　。狐鼠中跳梁，所恃維憂黠。不義必自斃，氛祲行將豁。簿海正騰懽，吾亦中腸熱。巴渚候歸艎，且爲風雲別。神方能縮地，千里頗超忽。異時一尊酒，遲爾江漬捋。秋風紫鞠蟹，春水桃花　。消息有盈虛，浩然天地闊。風沙  施濟美　　「有朋自遠方來，不亦說了？……」何况，還是來自北平的朋友，北平，這黃沙遍野的古城，却是長靑的宮殿，在我回憶的國裏。　　握着手，又驚又怯，且喜且悲，說不出話來了，說什麼呢？有什麼好說？在這滄海桑田的大變亂之後，又是好些歲月不通音訊，從那一句開頭呢？寶貴的開頭，我想起兩句唐詩：『乍見翻欵夢，相悲各問年。』　　朋友說『你口音改啦！』我說：『你樣子變啦！要是路上碰見，我管保不認識，跟小時候完全不同。』　　又沒話說了，在舞臺上，這呌「啞塲」，啞塲，是僵持的沉默，心裏有萬千種話；感謝上帝，我領略到人生戲臺上啞塲的滋味了，今天。　　朋友忽忽的去了，臨行丟下一對小玩意，道地的北京貨，景泰藍的小盒，感謝這一份友情，這多年，還記得我歡喜這些無用的，却是有趣的小東西。　　我輕輕的掀開那盒上的蓋，「會不會這裹面藏着點古城的風沙？那令人懷舊的塵埃……」但是，　　，空空如也。原不該如此希望的，然而却止不住失望起來。　　我的眼眶濕了，道眼淚，雖然無名，却也不見得無因。一年  楊謀　　又是一年！　　是心底的憤鬱。是失望，是痛苦的呻吟。　　年頭，我也曾喜悅的打起精神，凝想着些什麼計劃，但是，這些紅光立刻就慢慢的黯淡，隨着些生活上的不快，早就把周圍儘抹上了灰黑。我虔誠地膜拜着工作，但是，歲月是蹉跎了，帶來的是可怖的空虛和寂寞。弱。我咒自己：懶惰，零亂，懦　　我也咒這時代。　　看看周圍這些人吧，都是這麼莊嚴，神聖，高潔，……儼然都是紳士，但是，拼凑起來，這社會却多麼汚　我要咒，但是又怎麼咒？　　假使這世界泛瀾着洪流，那末這世界該洗滌得乾凈；假使這世界蔓延着烈火，那末一切汚穢該燒個精光；然而，只是我微弱的咒詛，道波流是多麼渺小啊！　　時間像一匹沒有覊的野馬，它怱忽的跑完了一年，我們少掉了一年。一年，不能說長，但是，也不短呀！默算去了的日子，恰像是一筆無頭無緒的亂賬，眞不知如何去找出端倪。　　咒吧！歲月是無辜的，咒的是自已，還有，那些——人們「三十六」詩話  老雕蟲　　（三十六年）　　杜牧阿房宮賦「而望幸焉，有不得見者，三十六年」。「不得見」，言相別之久，相思之深也，惟其不得見故，希望更殷，其最後之限度，則爲民國三十六年明甚。　　（三十六鴛鴦）　　李商隱詩「盡知三十六鴛鴦」，此謂民國三十六年是鴛鴦年。但願有情人都成眷屬，而皆大歡喜也。　　（三十六宮）　　徐凝詩「三十六宮秋夜長」三十六宮爲衆女爭寵之象，夜長則難免夢多也。又駱賓王詩「漢家離宮三十六」三十六亦言其「皇后亞皇」之多也。　　（三十六鱗）　　彥周詩話釋段成式與溫庭筠雲藍紙詩「三十六鱗充使時」鱗謂，鯉魚，三十六鱗，三十六尾鯉魚也。故今年又是鯉魚年。鯉魚豈有跳不過龍門之理乎？篆聯  史志超一寸山河一寸血140  葉勁風　　他來回走了幾度，覺得更加煩躁起來，神經緊張得簡直超越了限度，只得又回到那張沙發上坐下，竭力地把情緒壓制下去；「急有何用？……隨他去罷，……事情的演變，再焦躁些，也是不能挽回的……。」他只能如此想了。如此一想，神經也寗靜得多了。　　就在這乍一寗靜的當口，　際忽然傳來一種玉盤走珠的淸脆聲音：　　「大哥，快走動罷！」……　　鶴見一聽到這個聲音，不覺大吃一驚，立刻一抬身，挺直了腰幹，聚精會神，張起了耳朶，一面查聽聲音的來路，一面要聽聽下面還有什麼話。靜候了好一會，却什麼也驢不見了。　　那聲音字字淸晰，然而細微柔軟，好像　遠幽谷中傳來的一個　聲。在那句話剛一說畢，鶴見從沙發裹抬身起來，本能地曾經回頭查視了一眼，但查視的動作未畢，早又知道這是一種愚笨的反應行爲；因爲聲音的來源，絕對不在左近；從正確知識上去斷定，這好像是一種「心音，」只有自己的潛在意識，在恍惚狀態中才能聽到的，所以他又趕緊聚會精神，預備再聽下去。　　然而這又是一種錯誤：因爲按實用心理學說，人的精神一提起，潛在意識立刻就要潛伏起來。潛在意識的活動，只在精神衰弱的恍惚狀態範圍之內。　　爲什麼說這聲音的來源，絕對不在左近呢？第一，這發聲的人，不在客室之內，那是毫無疑問的。那麼最可能的左近，必是富外，或是門外。窗外的話，可以不必多所　　，除了神親不正常，　覺有毛病的人外，一聽聲音，立時就可知道來源的正確方向。鶴見這時，雖說情緒緊張，但神經的感覺仍極正常。假使這聲音是從窗外傳來的話，他一聽魷知，並且用不着說，第一個動作，必是奔向窗口，要探明人在那裏。當時他却沒有這種動作，可以知道他早斷定，這聲音並非窗外傳來。　　再說門外的話，那倒有些通理；因爲那聲音雖是淸晰，音度確實細微得如同隔着一層牆壁，傳達過來的一樣。那麼鶴見一聽到聲音，就應該從沙發喪一躍而起，三脚兩步，趕到門外去追尋這個發話的人。然而他也沒有道一舉：原因極其簡單。三脚兩步，趕到門外，那是我們這些外行的直覺動作，誰也贊成應當這麼辦。但有修養的特務工作者，絕對沒有這樣粗糙的隨意動作。首先他的知識就已經告訴他，這

<p>自由談	又失事  少夫　　中國航空公司滬平綫一二一號客機，前天又在靑島失事了，死難者計四十二人，在上海三機墮毀慘案餘痛猶在的此時，再遇此事，實在不知悲痛何似？　　這一連串的失事慘劇，人命財產的損失，公司方面的損失，白不在話下的了，然而最重大的，却是影響了一般人們對於航空的觀念，在航空事業正待大踏步前進的今日，這一影響實不可忽視。　　有事實爲證的，據報載漢口電，滬三機失事後，漢口的乘客紛紛改搭輪船，以致航空公司漢口辦事處與往日之門庭若市情形，大不相同。我們想想看，凡是有別種交通工具可利用的，人們爲什麼拿性命開玩笑，來冒這個險呢？　　交通部對於前决滬三機失事案，已有一個行政上的處分了，罰令停航一星期。這一處分自然經過愼重考慮的，不過我們認爲對於問題的癥結——此後的飛航安全，並沒有重大的關係，反由於這一處分令航空公司加重損失。倘使航空公司的經濟狀况不佳，請問它怎樣更有餘力來充實或改善飛行或地面設備。這是很明顯的。測字先生秘訣　靈不靈無從試騐　凖不凖只有天知  渡雲　　在街頭角落，在人行道上，每見有測字攤頭擺着，一方灰色的檯布，舖在一個見方不過三尺的臨時檯面上，照樣中間寫着一個別號，什麼「賽諸葛」「時半天」等。兩傍貼着一副對聯，上首是「萬卷奇醫知禍福」，下首是「一枝禿筆度春秋」，此外中問置一紙盒，安放着不少細捲兒。朝外坐着一個穿長衣的先生—所謂測字先生，面前擺着一版白色水板，也有用玻璃襯在白紙上的，左右筆墨硯台水盂，連帶抹字的粗紙兒。見有過往行人，便嘴衷唸着：「大事有三十六樁，小事有七十二件。樁樁好談，件件好問。君子問災不問福，請過來談談拆拆，靈不靈當塲試騐，準不準過後方知。胸中若有疑難事，隨手拿起字捲兒來，無論流年，月建，尋人，失物，正財偏財，統統好問」。　　說起測字，種類甚多，有指畫，奇門，八卦等等，現在單就普通的測字而言，拿起字捲來，一個或兩個，先在白版上寫着字兒，再就字之結構，分爲什麼木旁土旁，或加寫口土等等，把分字兒加上筆劃，寫成某字，由口中講解意義，凑成吉凶好歹，有的三言兩語，有的分析仔細，總使人得到一個定論而後已，然後纔肯摸出錢來、作測字先生的酬勞而後跑開。　　測字可說是文人末路，在爲生活掙扎中，無可奈何地出來幹這一套。說一句愜意話，倒是自由職業，不受任何拘束。司是測字先生也有技巧，大多數從經騐得來，分析字體，固然熟能生巧；但要使測字人說他準確倒也有一點秘訣。這一套秘訣，向來不足爲外人道，極其保守秘密。江湖上有四句俗謠：所謂「江湖一點訣，莫對妻兒說；若對外人道，妻兒沒得吃！」連自己妻兒都不肯說，枉論外人了。　　測字的秘訣，說穿了倒也不見其怪，是在憑一己之聰明，信口開河，隨便說說！好在來測字的對測字先生至少有一點信仰心，都是唯命是從的，從沒有要過證據或保證，說得他好一點，固然會使他心花怒放，如說他壞些，也居然會引起他無語的悲哀；至於準不準靈不靈，在測字先生手段高明者，倒可謂十成有八成把握。把握在那裏，在乎說話的技巧上，說得模稜兩可，不負責任，能左能右，那般來測字的人，準會佩服你不錯。其實所謂「窮算命富燒香」，來測字的人，心慌不定，火都含右徼幸心理，所謂觸機，你就湊其機會，以勸喩安慰爲第一要旨，其結果自然連不準也會準了。　　問失物　　測字問失物，要有測字者是男或是女。男人偶因家中失竊，來觸機測字，是有可無不可態度；不妨爽爽快快回復他是找不到了。女人便有許多分別。有的女人好容易藏了幾錢或首飾，一時失竊，要是愛邊沒有同伴，定是記憶力弱，一時記不起安放何處，如此情形，便可呌她他細尋找定必尋見的。但也有女主人失物，由女傭敢藏，那女佣反來用測字表自她的心跡的，那要看她形色慌張，神氣如何，在方語中下一個驚吿纔好，也許她會當塲承認下來，還說先生是神仙哩！　　問歸期　　測字問出門人消息或歸期，大抵女人居多，對象不外乎丈夫或兒子，丈夫出門，久久未歸，也許是環境不好，無錢寄家，於是通家信也懶得寫了，這樣的人，很難肯定歸期。至於有些爲兒女情長，時切懸念，那麼只有安慰之一法，在字面上寫出一個日期來，最好是初三或月半，或說初三以後，十五以前；甚至說本月不來，要看下月初三到十五了。因爲男子在外，遲早總要歸來的。至於問兒子的消息，或旅外景况，更宜投共情緒，說照字面看來，你兒子理應離開本土，走得越遠越好，而目最好不要呌他回來，其實因靑年人出門，無非習業，若半途回來，豈非　　職業麼？如此爲娘的心中放心，反說先生測字正準呢！　　問尋人　　還有問尋人消息。尤其靑年女孩，易受人誘騙失蹤，做家長的，在氣忿之餘，就來測字；那麼你雖明知是跟人逃走，也只好說，照字看來，傍邊還有一人。這人不懷好意，防人暗算，人遲早會回來，不過要破些財。這也是一想便明的事實，女兒跟人出走，多半順手牽羊，捲帶財物，等到床頭金盡，便悄悄地回來了。在未回來而有消息時，爲父母的，不免托人東尋西找，在在須錢，一樣是要破財的。在男孩失走。年大些的，也許爲家中受了訓斥，去躲在親戚家裘，那麼簡單回答，期以三日，三月不見則五日，五日不見至七日，七日不見，是誠不能見矣，因在親戚那兒，直至七日，無有不回家的，除非出了碼頭，那麼要呌他設法尋找了。至於問小孩失蹤，多半一時走失，父母心急測字，也許測了去，孩子巳有人領回來了，測字只是安慰他不必心急要緊；但有時也被拐騙去的，在爲父母慌迷中，還是指示他尋找方法，或報警局，或就近查訪，事後小孩有着，他忘了理智，反以爲先生測字眞靈呢！　　問病人　　也有爲病人來測字的。第一種是老年久病，累得家人坐臥不安。所謂「久病無孝子」，延醫服藥，均失其效，使來測個字兒。這種問病人，只可直截了當地說，這病不十分有望，但孝不如順，還是買些病人喜吃的東西，讓他吃吃，也許心境寬舒，病有轉機之望。有一種病已十分嚴重，生者却抱着無限希望，不得巳問籤求卜而來測字，那麼還是用安慰之一法，說吉人天相，並不要緊，最好請個醫生看看，或送入醫院去，照字面看來，尙無大礙，儘可放心。這般的暗示，假若就診而愈，總說測字靈騐，萬一不幸，也第一去怪　生看得不好，而不會怪到測字先生的身上去的。　　工商蕭條　問謀事　　目前工商蕭條，失業者衆，尤其是勞工界，因了失業，便夾測字。測字先生還是投其心理，給予他安慰，老是說一套，機會是有的，但須從中有朋友帮忙，也許貴人相逢，儘可有意外成功，放心放心，不過等一些時問問題而已。其實說穿了，並無意義，因爲介紹職業，自然應由朋友推薦，而推薦的人，地位自然較高，那就是所謂貴人了。至於時間二字，更無肯定，大有伸縮，一月不會嫌短，一年也不能算長，總有一天，會找到職業的。還有的說，你的財運要過立春纔交進，其實在冬季可說立春，在秋季不妨說立冬，都是未來日子，和病人拖延日子般的，過了一天算一天。再吿誠一句，一交正運，千萬不要胡調接近女人，因爲正財最忌桃花，也許返而倒霉。其實所謂交正運，便是有了職業，若因此荒唐，不但金錢與精神兩失，自然會影響職業的。　　問正財　　做生意人問芷財，也來測字，那麼要探知其所執何業，也一面參透市情，多少可明瞭些某種生意，近日市情如何，也不過用些敷衍性質，人云亦云而已。至於農人間收成，村女問桑麻棉花之類，只要說看天時，或久晴不雨，或久雨不晴，參些理智來說幾句進進出出的話，比如久旱自無收成，棉花熟時，下了大雨，自然減收成等等，也不過鄕老常談而已！　　問偏財　　最有趣的是問偏財，測字先生什九可回說，老兄偏財不可靠，只有正財。其實偏財，指不正當的收入，不正當收入，怎會有把握呢？普通偏財指賭博而言。金聖嘆有云：「賭不輸錢，爲天下第一大利」，因爲凡是賭博，沒有不輸錢的。有人測字，問先生今天去賭錢，是輸是贏。回答的一句話，你依我的話，必不會輸。因爲照字看來，你的偏財不佳，只有一個方法，可保證不輸錢。這時他便問有什麼方法？說明了也是平淡，便是「不去賭」，不去賭還會輸錢麼！　　總之：測字的秘訣，在乎不着邊際，隨機應變，至於字的筆劃分析加减，不過還是工具性質。測字知禍福是未必，禿筆度生活，倒是實在。來測字者出錢買希望與安慰，那你就給他希望與安慰，便是惟一的秘訣了！早茶籃色多瑙河  藍寗節譯自「皇冠雜誌」　　一位作曲家的妻子，看着一大堆骯髒的襯衣歎氣。她丈夫旣然整日只是埋頭勤奮地寫作曲譜，襯衣上不應如此汚髒的啊！她又拿到了一件，看見袖口上竟寫着曲譜。　　顯明地她對這衣服樂譜並不感到興趣；但是剛想把襯衣放下的時候，她的極有音樂修養的雙目在上面一瞥，抓住了開始的幾段音符。她低低哼着，覺得調子很悅耳。　　因爲另外還有着一點事情，她匆匆將那一件襯衫放在一旁，却把其餘衣服捲了起來，等洗衣婦人來取。幾分鐘後，她發現那襯衫不見了。當件她上樓去的時候，那洗衣婦人業已來過，盒走了所有的衣服。　　她不知道那洗衣婦人住在那裏，但還是立即坐了馬車出去，跑遍全城尋覓——走過曲曲折折的街道，泥濘的小路。找了幾個鐘頭，一家酒店裏的一位老婦人陪她到了一個小村子裏，從這洗衣婦人手中奪下了那件寳貴的襯衫。稍遲一刻，它便要給浸入皂水中去了。這倖免付之皂沫的袖口上曲譜便是人所共知的史屈勞斯的不朽名曲「藍色多瑙河」。上海橫斷面叫化子的歌曲  黃嘉謨　　　　做乞丐都要會歜唱，雖然僅有極簡陋的樂器伴奏，但也唱得有腔有調。其中多半是丐頭傳擾下來的舊歌曲。可以通川於普通的塲合。尤其是對於一般商店與住戶，總是以吉利語編成的。但若對方一毛不拔，那就馬上改換詞鋒，狂放誅詞，以爲報復。有經騐的乞丐，還能够隨時編造歌詞，以投合特種的需要。茲舉例如下：　　（一）恭維　　「烏龜上門來，老板大發財。」　　「太太給我兩個錢，太太長壽萬萬年。」　　「老爺大發慈心，今年獲利千金。」　　「太太施恩，抱子抱孫。」　　（二）謾駡　　「不給我錢，怎過今年？」　　「不給財，我不來。剩下了錢買棺村。」　　「你不給，我不乞，看你子死急不急？」　　（三）調侃的　　「那邊要了道邊要，掌櫃的吃飯我來到。」　　「掌櫃的大發財，掌櫃的吃飯我正來。」　　「唉！掌櫃的你別生氣，早給一個早了的去。」　　「唉！掌櫃的給了個沙板錢，我呌他換換他爲了難。」　　（四）報喜的：〔冒充報子祝福〕　　「報報報，報給大老爺知道。　　大公子一品當朝，二公子兵部官高。　　三公子狀元及第，四公子出使西遼。　　五公子年紀雖小，皇宮裏駙馬新招。　　吩咐外邊快些升砲罷！（作放砲姿勢。）　　呼呼！潑　！一砲勿響，缺少錢糧。　　討個銅錢，買來再放，馬上就響。」　　（五）扮春牛　　「春牛到，生意好。　　　號一年四季賺元寶。　　摸摸青牛頭，生意一年好到頭。摸摸春牛脚，生意一年好到脚。　　發財發財，元寳搭台。　　窮人討過，下次勿來！」　　（六）送金磚　　「金磚到門來，添喜又添歡。　　年年多富貴，歲歲大發財。　　金磚四角方，寳號裏四時生意忙。　　金磚一聲響，寳號　黃金漲萬兩。」　　（七）棺材舖　　「打竹板兒邁大步，眼前來在棺材舖掌櫃做的棺材眞呌好。」　　盛上死人跑不了，盛上活人受不了　　呱打！呱打！呱打呱！」　　（八）搖錢樹（二丐合唱）　　『搖錢樹到門來。「好！」　　添喜又添財。「好！」　　年年生意好！「好！」　　元寶滾進來！「好！」　　搖錢樹搖一搖！「好！」　　寳號裏生意更加好。「好！」　　搖錢樹再搖搖。「好！」　　滿樹盡是金錢大元寶。。「好！」』停航一週  蕭亢石　　讀六日本報，說中航機又有一架在靑島墜毀，乘客及機師四十三人，全部罹難，血肉糢糊，可謂慘極！　　看到這件飛機失事，乘客和機師竟無一生還，比聖誕節那天的飛機失事，更見得悽慘！而一幕幕的這種慘案，不斷地發生，眞覺到愈演而愈烈了！　　在一般平民和我們這些窮文化人，根本沒有福份去乘飛機，而飛機的疊遭失事，與多數人沒有「痛癢相關」，所以也淡焉視之。可是爲了國家建設着想，和交通安全起見，却不得不使我們發生着一些感觸！　　我們想：聖誕日旣然飛機出了空前的岔子，那麼公司方面對於氣候的轉變，應該更加仔細預測，而在設備上更宜詳加補充！然而上海慘劇再隔一旬，而靑島慘案又已發生，在這裹可見公司方面，「未能改善」其飛行的業務，同時也顯見當局「未曾嚴加督飭管理」，實以致之！否則也決不會「一再失事」了？這責任，是極明顯而無可諱方的！　　現在竟於一旬之中，再發生了「前機之墜」，當局始令「停航一週」，詳細檢查各項設備，以策安全。然而何以不及早此謀？致枉死城中，又多添了四十三名，這是「誰之咎歟」？兩條功能狗  建華　　紐約日報近載：美國二功狗，一名『配興」，一名『海琪』，當在此次大戰的時候，二狗也參加戰爭，馳聘在鎗林彈雨中，救回傷兵二千零八十四人，爲國效勞，獲得獎金二十萬元。德國戰敗以後，美軍四百人，護送這兩隻功狗，榮歸加利福尼省，狗坐紥彩的汽車中，前面並有軍樂引導，所過的地方，觀衆拍手觀呼，情形非常熱烈。獎金二十萬元，現已全數捐入紅十字會，作爲二功狗的永久紀念。一月一日起，加省各報，將登廣吿一星期，祝賀功狗誕辰，（Birthday　of　Trumphant　dogs）藉以增加勝利的光榮。又一個　國產趣聞  甘來　　據廣州大光報載：該市軍事當局以軍人出入酒棋茶室，非但浪費金錢，更且『荒廢時間』，特明令由今年元且起，凡屬軍人一律不得進入酒樓茶室了。　　飲食也算『荒廢時間』，一向聞所未聞，這一條曠古絕今的「明令」，到目前爲止，似乎還祗限於廣州，因而「笑話」也祗限於一地。　　但是我們似乎應該問一句：將校份　軍人，不知也受此限制不？這位小朋友被稱爲“Mrs.　1960”，意爲在一九六〇年，她將是一位家庭主婦。圖示她在新式設備的小廚房中燙衣服。這是最近在英京舉行的「英國目己能够製造」的展覽會中的一景。這展覽會近由英皇主特在英京開慕。　　常識測騐一杯水的科學  丁一厂　　冬夜消閒的玩意兒　　冬天裏盡短夜長，而且不像夏天有那末多戶外生活。來吧，弄幾個玻璃杯子，添上杯杯淸水，照着下面的發問，請大家來考騐一下自己的科學常識，以消漫漫長夜吧！　　下文所述及的東西，除了杯子和水以外，大體上也是普通家庭所常有的東四，不必特別張羅。　　題目最好是先憑自己的腦子去思索一番，在每題下三項疑問中選出一項你認爲答案是「對」或「是」的畫個記號。明天再對對本欄發表的答案，便可知道猜中若干條。　　有幾項題目。對於你的弟弟妹妹或許頗感興趣。請把一些科學常識解釋給他們吧。趣味不一定是科學，然而，枓學是可以趣味此的。　　〔1〕鐵比水重，這是誰也知道的事實。但是，你以爲鐵做的東西扔在水面，一定毫無例外的沈下水底麼？請用一個盛滿淸水的玻璃杯來試試看，取出一片乾凈而不沾濕氣的保安剃刀片，慢慢的輕輕的放在水而，你以爲：　　A　它必定立即沈下杯底麼？　　B　刀片有三個以上圓洞子的話，即沈；無洞的，可浮呢？　　C　抑或，憑着水面的「張力」的支持它必可以浮而不沈呢？　　〔2〕同樣也是上頭的一杯水。拿出一根針來，在什麼地方先「磨磨」它使它帶上一點磁力，（比方用磁石朝着一個方向在針上擦動幾次，或者吸在有磁力的餐刀上一會兒之類），然後把針擱在兩個指頭之上，慢慢的沈入水內，（指頭出水時不可與針相碰）看着吶：　A　這鋼針兒也定石沈下杯底而毫無例外麼？　　B　針兒可以浮在水面麼？　　C　抑或，除了能浮水以外，假如針放下去的方向略近於「正北」與「正南」的話，這有磁力的針還可以轉動兩端而朝向正南呢？　　〔3〕拿一個喝啤酒或汽水用的大玻璃杯子，灌滿一杯熱水至不能再滿，然後，用茶匙勺一勺白糖，很慢很慢的傾糖人杯內，直至一匙糖完全傾盡爲止，你以爲：　　A　這杯糖水不會外溢麼？　　B　這杯糖水必定有些外溢，而溢出的水，共體積與傾進的糖相等呢　　C　抑或，燒開過的熱水則不外溢，沒有開過的熱水則外溢呢？　　〔4〕請取兩個大小相同的大玻璃杯，標明「甲」，「乙」，然後用一個小杯作爲量杯，在「甲」杯裏灌入一小杯酒精和一小杯水，在乙杯裏灌入兩小杯都是水，（每次小杯都灌得很滿才算一杯）請比較一下「甲」和「乙」兩大杯裏液體表面的高度即杯內物的體積，你以爲：　　A　甲乙兩杯都相同嗎？　　B　甲比乙來得多得嗎？　　C　抑或乙此甲來得多呢？　　〔5〕容積相同的甲·乙·丙三隻玻璃杯，分別滿注如下三種飲料，你以爲那是最重，次重，和最輕的呢？　　A　清水。　　B　啤酒。　　C　牛乳。　　〔6〕這裏有兩個戒指，大小不一樣，一個是純金，一個是鉛製鍍眞金，你能够用一杯水，和一把由國藥店借來僅可秤到幾錢幾分的小秤子，而分別兩者中那個戒指才是十足眞金的麼？　　〔7〕檯子上有三個玻璃杯子，用三片玻璃分別蓋着，但知三者之中僅有一杯是灌滿了淸水。不許你指觸杯身杯口，光憑一根沒有盒子的擦不亮火的黑頭安全洋火，看你有什麼方法指出那一杯是有水的，那兩杯是空的呢？　　〔8〕在一張光滑的餐桌上，放着一枚光滑的名片，但名字是訛都看不到，因爲一個杯底平滑的玻璃杯恰巧壓在卡片上頭，而杯裏還留着半杯左右的葡萄酒。請問有什麼方法，兩手不許碰動杯子，很輕易就一下子取出那張名片來，而且這酒杯還是留回原有的地方？　　〔9〕水平水平，一杯水的水面當然是平的。但我請問：在上海斟一杯水在杯子裏所成的水平面，和在羅馬斟一杯水在杯子裏所成的水平面，照你想：這兩個水平面之問：　　A　同是在一個水平面麼？　　B　雖不同一個水平面，但彼此平行麼？　　C　抑或，並不平行，而交叉成一個近於直角的角度呢？　　〔10〕杯子裏放滿冰塊，然後放入零度以下的電氣冰箱裏，時見水汽上騰，你以爲這現象是：　　A　固體不經先成液體而直接汽化的「昇華」？　　B　蒸發？　　C　溶解？　　答案請看明日本刊</p>

        <h1>1947.01.07</h1>
<h3>Special Envoy Marshall to Return Home to Report; Met with Chairman and Ambassador Stuart Yesterday; Decision on Whether to Return to China Will Be Made After Arriving in the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Special Envoy Marshall has recovered from his severe cold. He visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:30 AM on the 6th for lunch and a lengthy conversation. At 5:30 PM, he visited Chairman Chiang again, departing after a half-hour discussion. According to general observation, Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Marshall on the 5th preceded Marshall's visits to Stuart and Chiang on the 6th, and the true implications are not difficult to surmise. Additionally, Nankai University President Zhang Boling visited Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 6th for a meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] United Press reported from Washington that Special Envoy Marshall will soon return to the United States to report to President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes on the situation in China. Whether Marshall will return to China after his trip to the United States will be decided after the three-way meeting. The reporter specially visited the American Embassy spokesman, Connors, to inquire whether this was true. Connors stated, "Nothing is yet known."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshall, barring unforeseen developments, will immediately return to the country to report to President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes. Whether Marshall will conclude his thirteen-month diplomatic mission at this point or will still return to China to make new efforts to mediate the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists depends on the outcome of consultations upon his return. Whether the situation is still salvageable depends especially on Marshall's own decision. However, most well-informed sources in Washington believe that Marshall's chances of returning to China are slim. If this is the case, it will raise the question of a U.S. Ambassador to China, as the diplomatic community believes that after Marshall's retirement, his close colleague, Ambassador Stuart, will also resign. In addition, there are two other possible developments after Marshall's return: (1) Political observers predict that as soon as there are signs that Marshall will stay in the country for a long time, his illustrious name will become a talking point for the 1948 presidential election. (2) Marshall will return home to rest. His friends believe that this 66-year-old military diplomat will retire to a farm in Virginia, but officials predict that Truman will still keep him in an important position. Regarding this, officials have discussed the possibility of Marshall replacing Admiral Leahy as the President's Chief of Staff. Leahy is 71 years old and has held this position since the beginning of the war. He may retire in the future or take on a diplomatic position.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai, Lei Zhen has been extremely busy. On the evening of the 5th, he had a long talk with Zhang Junmai, who introduced Lei to the standing committee members of the China Democratic Socialist Party. According to Xu Fulin, the party's propaganda minister, the meeting between Lei and Zhang was only for exchanging opinions and no decisions were made. Within the Democratic Socialist Party, opinions on whether to join the government are still divided. Xu pointed out that the statements made by some members of the Democratic Socialist Party regarding participation in the government as reported in the newspapers were "personal opinions" because the party's stance had not yet been decided. Xu had attempted to meet with Wu Tiecheng, but was unsuccessful due to Wu's illness. It is generally believed here that the internal divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party, which emerged when deciding whether to participate in the National Assembly, seem even more serious this time during the dispute over the government reorganization, and there is a significant possibility of a split.</p>
<h3>General Budget Fully Audited; Participating Committee Compiles Report</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Participating Committee of the Political Consultative Council held its fifth temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 6th. More than 20 people, including Fu Sinian, attended. First, Hu Shanheng, the chief accountant of the Executive Yuan, reported on the general situation and income figures for the receipt of enemy and puppet assets. The budget was 800 billion, but there are currently remaining houses that cannot be sold (such as the Broadway Building in Shanghai). Yin Shuxian and others frequently raised questions, stating that the detailed quantities of remaining items were not listed within the budget amount. They stated that the specific types of remaining materials should be listed. Hu replied that the remaining items were all land and houses. Attendees successively raised many questions about the problems of receiving materials. Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu reported on the budget situation of the China Textile Corporation, hoping to increase income and strive to increase production this year. This year's budgeted income is 400 billion. If production can be increased, it will be profitable, but it must be coordinated with financial policy. Subsequently, councilors raised questions, expressing dissatisfaction that the control of cotton yarn and cloth and the black market had not been improved, and discussed the issue of surplus U.S. military materials. Finally, the amendments to the review opinions of the first group were passed. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM to discuss the review opinions of the second and third groups, adjourning at around 6:00 PM. The entire budget review was completed and a detailed review report will be compiled.</p>
<h3>Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League</h3>
<p>Zhang Lan and Others Elected to Presidium</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The First Session of the Second Plenary Meeting of the China Democratic League opened on the morning of the 6th. Attendees included Zhang Lan, Zhang Dongsun, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, Shi Liang, Zhou Jingwen, Liu Yazi, Xian Ying, Ye Duyi, Liu Wang Liming, Deng Chumin, Chu Tunan, Zhou Xinmin, and others, totaling over 30 people. Zhang Lan, Zhang Dongsun, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Zhang Shenfu, and Deng Chumin were elected to the presidium. Huang Yanpei chaired the morning session, during which Zhou Xinmin, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, and other heads of various departments of the League presented work reports. Shen Junru chaired the afternoon session, during which representatives from League branches in various regions presented reports and passed two resolutions: (1) to commemorate fallen League members, collect their posthumous works, publish special collections, and construct memorial halls; (2) to pay respects to the families of fallen League members and provide compensation. Zhang Lan delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, the main points of which were as follows: (1) Regarding the political system, the China Democratic League advocates a parliamentary system with universal suffrage and a bicameral system. For the highest administrative organ of the state, it adopts a cabinet system. The League advocates the implementation of constitutional government and the rule of law, but does not recognize that having a constitution equates to constitutional government, and therefore argues that no individual or political party should be above the law. (2) The League's future goals are twofold: to gain sympathy and to strengthen organization. (3) League members must maintain their independence and not abandon their own views casually, echoing the views of others. They should not seek temporary expediency and overlook long-term and greater plans.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Concludes Affairs; Three Measures Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] With the end of the National Assembly approaching, the Secretariat held a working meeting at 3:00 PM on the 6th, chaired by Secretary-General Hong Lanyou. They reviewed all past work and discussed various concluding matters, and the following was decided: (1) Personnel who have made special efforts should be rewarded separately. (2) Except for the accounting and general affairs departments handling the concluding affairs, the affairs of all other units shall be concluded by the 15th. (3) Each unit shall compile various regulations and data charts in a systematic manner and archive them for future reference.</p>
<h3>Zhao Chen Discusses the Lei Qilin Case; Nanjing High Court Has the Right to Hear the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Zhao Chen, President of the Nanjing High Court, told our reporter on the 6th that regarding the request from Lei Qilin, a National Assembly representative from Ningxia, for a transfer of jurisdiction after his arrest, he had instructed the court's procuratorate to submit a request for review. Zhao stated that although the "crime" and the place of prosecution in Lei's case were both in Ningxia, the defendant was in Nanjing, and the charge against him was "suspicion of internal rebellion." According to law, the High Court should be the court of first instance. In order to ensure a fair trial, it is appropriate to transfer jurisdiction. The Nanjing High Court has the right to hear this case, but this "suspicion of internal rebellion" case has not yet gone through the investigation process, so it should be handled by the High Procuratorate first.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Flies to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Ahmatjan Accompanies Him on the Flight</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 6th] Chiang Ching-kuo flew to Qingdao on a special plane at 9:30 AM on the 6th, passing through Tianjin. Ahmatjan, a National Assembly representative from Xinjiang, and his party accompanied him on the flight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] Ahmatjan, Vice Chairman of Xinjiang Province, and his party arrived in Qingdao on the 6th noon on the Meiling aircraft, taking up residence in the Yingbin Hotel. In the afternoon, they toured the city and visited the aquarium. In the evening, the city government held a cocktail party to host them, and they visited various factories and the China Textile Corporation.</p>

<h3>Frequent Accidents Involving Two Civil Aviation Companies; Ministry of Communications Decides to Start Rectification; Convenes Relevant Parties to Begin Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Due to the serious situation of frequent accidents involving civil aviation aircraft, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the two airlines to suspend flights for a week starting from the 6th, and has scheduled a meeting at the Ministry on the 6th, convening the general managers and heads of flight groups of the two companies to discuss rectification matters. Responsible personnel from the Ministry of Communications will also attend. It has just been learned that due to adverse weather, the personnel of the two companies were unable to fly to Nanjing yesterday and will take the night train from Shanghai on the 7th, and the meeting has been rescheduled for the 7th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Starting from the 7th, both civil aviation companies will suspend the sale of passenger tickets in compliance with the order, except for mail, which will continue to fly as usual.

It is heard that a thorough inspection and rectification will be carried out on all civil aviation aircraft parts and airport equipment of the two companies to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Administration to Revise Takeoff Weather Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to unfavorable weather and insufficient flight equipment, four passenger planes have unfortunately crashed in the past twelve days, with a total of 113 passengers and crew members killed. It is truly unfortunate that accidents have occurred continuously at a time when the civil aviation industry is waiting to develop. The plane that crashed the night before was China National Aviation Corporation's AC-46 type aircraft number 121, which departed from Shanghai for Beijing at 5:10 AM on the 5th, with the entire journey scheduled to take five hours. However, two and a half hours after leaving Shanghai, the plane intended to land at the U.S. Marine Corps' seaside airfield in Qingdao, but due to adverse weather and poor visibility, it crashed into a mountain and was burned. After the plane crashed, the China National Aviation Corporation immediately dispatched two planes to the accident site to search. It is now known that one of the pilots was Mr. Kellogg. The search results were immediately reported to Qingdao, stating that the plane had been severely damaged and no surviving passengers were seen. At this time, the Qingdao office of the China National Aviation Corporation immediately organized a rescue team to venture into the area controlled by the CCP where the accident occurred. In the early morning, they discovered the wreckage of the plane, and all passengers and crew members had died. It is reported that the Qingdao seaside airfield has radar equipment and is used by the U.S. Marine Corps Aviation, and its communications equipment is rarely seen anywhere else in the country, but the plane did not make contact with ground radar, and ultimately crashed into a mountain and burned in weather with only 800 feet of visibility, which is also a tragic event!</p>
<p>Shen Desie, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Tweed, the American director, and Gao Dajing, the business director, were summoned to Beijing yesterday, but were unable to travel in the morning due to adverse weather. The company also planned to send a special plane to Qingdao yesterday to rush to handle the aftermath, but it was unsuccessful due to weather conditions.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Communications was very concerned after hearing about this and will revise the takeoff weather standards to improve the safety of passengers in the future. After the suspension order was implemented, according to statistics from the Ministry of Communications, 77 civil aviation aircraft will be suspended, including 40 belonging to the China National Aviation Corporation (23 C-47, DC-3, C-53 types, 20 C-46s, and 6 DC-4s), and 28 belonging to the Central Air Transport Corporation (16 C-47, DC-3, C-53 types, and 12 C-46s). The number of aircraft deployed by the two companies each day is approximately 30. According to Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, during the suspension period, takeoff weather standards will be revised. The takeoff weather standards for Shanghai Airport are still satisfactory, but Qingdao, Beijing, Guangzhou and other places need to be revised more strictly. At the same time, experts will meet with the heads of the two companies during this period to review the equipment of each company, and the Ministry of Communications will also send personnel to participate when necessary.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The American Navy authorities in this city released a statement late last night regarding the details of the U.S. military's handling of the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's Flight 121 in Qingdao. According to the American spokesperson, although the China National Aviation Corporation did not notify the U.S. side in advance that a plane was landing in Qingdao on the morning of the 5th, in accordance with past practice, the U.S. Navy's landing equipment was fully supplied for use. The U.S. Navy initially received a telegram from the China National Aviation Corporation stating that "a plane was overdue and had not arrived" at 12:10 PM. Although the weather was extremely bad at the time, the Navy still dispatched a seaplane to venture out to search and rescue. Shortly after the plane departed, the pilot, E.C. Smith, received a report from the China National Aviation Corporation that the wreckage of the crashed plane had been found at the foot of a 1,100-foot-high mountain five miles northeast of Qingdao Airport. Pilot Smith flew to the location and confirmed that the report was true. Colonel McIntyre, the commander of Qingdao Airport, immediately dispatched a search and rescue team to the accident site, accompanied by representatives of the China National Aviation Corporation. It was discovered at the time that the plane had been completely destroyed and no passengers or flight personnel had survived.</p>
<h3>Central Air Transport Corporation's Freight and Mail Transport; Ministry of Communications Approves Flights; Post Office Still Accepts Airmail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Wenkuan, Chief of the Flight Group of the Central Air Transport Corporation, told our reporter that the company has already suffered heavy losses due to past plane crashes, and if all flights are suspended again this time, there will only be expenses and no income within a week, and the financial strength will not be able to support it. Therefore, the company specially requested the Ministry of Communications to suspend passenger transport but not freight and mail transport. The Ministry of Communications replied by telegram on the afternoon of the 6th, approving the request. As for the China National Aviation Corporation, the company in Beijing has also requested the Ministry of Communications to do the same. According to a person in charge of the Post Office, all airmail will still be accepted.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Area Implements Amnesty Decree; District Court Has Released More Than 30 Prisoners; Courts in Beijing Study Release Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] After the National Government issued the amnesty decree, the Capital Area was ordered to implement it after the publication of the decree on New Year's Day. In recent days, both the Capital High Court and District Court have been extremely busy. The High Court, in addition to ruling all cases where the most severe sentence already handed down was imprisonment for a definite period or less to be dismissed for those who have applied for reconsideration and appealed, in accordance with Article 194, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Chief Justice Zhao Chen also met with Hu Taifu, the head of the prison section of the court on the 6th to give detailed instructions on the work of releasing prisoners, which will be implemented soon. The District Court began implementation on the 4th, and has released more than 30 prisoners in the past two days. Currently, the prisoners in the ordinary cells of Tiger Bridge Prison are discussing this topic every day, calculating how they will be pardoned or have their sentences reduced, and are extremely happy and excited. However, the group of traitors in the "cell" is quite uneasy and is brewing a request for clemency,妄想妄想 to escape punishment.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The amnesty decree has arrived in Beiping, and the Hebei High Court and District Court in Beiping are investigating prisoners and studying release procedures. According to investigations, among the more than 1,800 prisoners held in the First Prison, excluding more than 600 traitors, about half of the remaining prisoners may have their sentences reduced or be pardoned.

<h3>Peking University Will Act as Guardian to Assist Violated Female Student; Hu Shi Hosts Reporters to Release Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Hu Shi hosted reporters at 7:00 PM today to discuss the rape of a Peking University female student, Ms. Shen, by an American soldier. Mr. Hu first denied the rumors that Ms. Shen had gone to Shanghai, saying that Shen was still in Beiping and maintained contact with the school and other relevant parties every day. The claim that Shen had lost her freedom was even more absurd, because Shen had no relatives in Beiping, and Peking University, acting as her guardian, hired three law professors from Peking University, Yan Shutang and Fei Qing, and Tsinghua University Professor Cai Shujing, as her legal advisors to provide assistance. In addition, Disctrict Court Prosecutor Ji Yuan is also collecting evidence. Shen suffered six injuries at the time due to the American soldier's violent behavior, and two still remain.</p>

<h3>Li Shifang Dies in Plane Crash; Dr. Mei Mourns His Prize Pupil, Unable to Sleep; Yao Yufu Sighs That His Beloved Son-in-Law's Fate Was Sealed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Among the passengers who perished in this disaster was the famous Peking opera star "Little Mei Lanfang," Li Shifang (see picture).</p>
<p>Li was one of Mei Lanfang's favorite disciples. He had been staying at Mei's residence in Shanghai for more than half a year. Recently, under the personal guidance of his teacher Mei, he learned many "skills" and "movements," and his artistry became even more refined. Mei Lanfang was also deeply satisfied. Two days before the accident (i.e., the evening of the 2nd of this month), he even performed "Jinshan Temple" with his teacher Mei Lanfang at the China Theater. Unexpectedly, this performance became his swan song. At a time when Peking opera talents are dwindling, it is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>When Mei Lanfang received the news of the plane crash at around 10 o'clock the night before, he was heartbroken and could not sleep all night, becoming like a "tearful person." Until yesterday, he was listless and unable to eat. He even considered canceling the last performance of "Feng Huan Chao," but after persuasion from all sides, he reluctantly appeared on stage with sorrow.</p>
<p>However, when Mei Lanfang went to the "China" backstage last night, his eyes were still red and swollen, and his "eyebrows" were furrowed as he sat blankly in the dressing room, silently looking at the mirror. His wife was by his side, her eyes also filled with tears, unable to bear the grief. At this time, the gongs and drums were loud, but Mei seemed unmoved, his mind in turmoil, feeling at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p>According to Yao Yufu, Li Shifang's father-in-law, Li was an only son, only 26 years old, and had been married for four years, with three daughters. His youngest daughter had not even had the chance to see him. The entire family currently resides in Peiping. Before the trip, Mei Lanfang, knowing that plane crashes happened repeatedly, advised him to postpone his trip and take a sea vessel instead, but in the end, he thought that such a coincidence would not happen, and resolutely departed. Unexpectedly, this trip became a permanent farewell. Yao sighed deeply and said, "What else can I say? I can only attribute it to fate!"</p>
<p>The Co-Pilot Wan Hanguang Was Also Studying at Guanghua University</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Co-pilot Wan Hanguang, a native of Hunan, was 26 years old. He lived at No. 29 Minde Lane, Huangdu Road, Sichuan Road. He was amiable and graduated from the first class of the Civil Aviation Driving Training Program in Labehe, China. In addition to working as a co-pilot at China National Aviation Corporation, he was also a sophomore in the Department of Biology at Guanghua University in this city (student number 7703). He had a girlfriend, Xiong Lanying, who was studying at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. During the New Year holiday, she came to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 5th, he left Shanghai Tower to go to Hangzhou to take the final exam, but he did not know that his beloved would die in the disaster. Before the flight, Wan Hanguang had left a leave application for the Guanghua University Student Guidance Group. The application had not been sent out when this misfortune occurred. Because he usually hid the fact that he was studying and working at the same time, the authorities at Guanghua University may not yet know the full story. (The picture is of Wan Hanguang.)</p>
<p>Flying Tiger Pilot, Sharkey, Also Perished</p>
<p>The American pilot of the crashed plane, Charles Joseph Sharkey, was originally scheduled to resign from the company in two or three months and return to the United States with his Russian wife, Lydia. Unexpectedly, the flight to Peiping became a permanent farewell. His wife was originally scheduled to go to the United States before Christmas, but she stayed in Shanghai waiting for Sharkey to go with her. Late last night, Lydia asked friends to call various newspapers to inquire about Sharkey's whereabouts.</p>
<p>According to reports, Sharkey used to be under the command of General Chennault's Flying Tigers. The first group of seven members of the team flew over the Hump to supply China. Six of them had already passed away, and Mr. Sharkey was the last surviving one. Mr. Sharkey had received a medal from the Chinese government.</p>
<p>British businessman James J. Ross served in the police station during the concession era and was one of the people in charge of the Jingnv Temple area. He had many friends in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhang Ruyan, an editor of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, was transferred to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao as an editor by order of the newspaper. Unfortunately, he encountered this catastrophe and died on the coast of Qingdao. This is indeed a great loss of a talented editor for the Ta Kung Pao, and also a loss of a strong general in the journalistic field. Before Mr. Zhang left Shanghai, he was in a "hot love" period, and the date of his engagement was not far away, but now he has "left forever," which is also sad! According to reports, Mr. Zhang graduated from the Department of Journalism at Yanjing University in Chengdu in 1944.</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Gives a Speech in Canada; The World Should Emphasize Morality</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Niagara Falls, Canada, 6th] He Yingqin, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, attended the North American Moral Re-Armament Conference here today and gave a speech, saying: The international germ is not in economic institutions, but is deeply hidden in the heart of every person in the world.

<h3>Communist Party of China Obstructs Dike-Closing Project; Xue Dubi Protests; Hopes for a Solid Guarantee That No More Acts of Destruction Will Occur</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, sent a letter to the delegation of the Communist Party of China on the 6th regarding the Yellow River management issue, protesting the destruction of the Luwang Dike Quarry by the Communist troops during the construction period and the disappearance of more than 200 workers. He also hoped that the Communist Party of China would guarantee that no similar incidents would occur in the future and release the captured workers. The full text of his letter is as follows: "Dear Sirs: The Luwang Dike Quarry in Xinxiang was destroyed by the Communist army in May last year. Later, Mr. Zhou Enlai of your party replied in a letter on June 11, stating: 'In addition to ordering the escort of the 15 captured workers back to work, the responsible authorities have been ordered to severely punish the perpetrators and ensure that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and to cooperate fully in accordance with the river management agreement,' etc. However, in December, this commission received telegrams from the Yellow River Dike-Closing and Restoration Project Bureau, stating that on December 9, at 12:00 PM, more than 600 bandits suddenly entered the Luwang Dike Quarry, destroying three mountain-opening machines, one bulldozer, and auxiliary tools such as ten large trucks, one large jeep, and auxiliary tool parts, burning 88 large barrels of gasoline, and kidnapping six workers from the quarry, seven guards, and six rifles. It was later found that this was done by the 51st Regiment of Huang Xinru's unit in the Fourth Sub-District of the Taihang Military Region. At the same time, this commission also received telegrams from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Hebei and Shandong Flood Prevention Offices of the commission, stating that Communist troops harassed the vicinity of a section of the construction site south of Changyuan County, Hebei Province, and kidnapped two workers, etc. In May last year, this commission, together with the representatives of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and your party, discussed and agreed on the implementation plan in Beijing. This commission has always followed this agreement and carried out the project accordingly. However, your party not only did not act in accordance with the agreement, but repeatedly violated its promises, even ordering the army to plunder the stone quarry and kidnap the workers. It is extremely obvious that this was a planned act of sabotage. It is hoped that your party will ensure that no similar incidents will occur in the future, and immediately order the release of the kidnapped quarry workers and guards to facilitate the work. I hope to receive a reply. Respectfully, To the Delegation of the Communist Party of China."</p>
<h3>Mr. Xue Discusses the Status of the Dike-Closing Construction with Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] On the 6th, a reporter visited Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, who explained the recent construction situation of the Huayuankou Dike-Closing Project as follows: (1) Current Status of the Dike-Closing Project: The old line caisson of the dike entrance was connected on December 11. The current width of the dike entrance is about 200 meters, and the depth varies from about 2 to 3 meters. After continuous rock throwing, the water level gradually rose. From December 27, a portion of the water has flowed into the old channel, and as of New Year's Day, the canal head has reached the territory of Kaifeng County; (2) Dike Restoration Project: The dike section on our side has been completed successively, only approaching the Communist area, the construction is difficult, and it is difficult to complete on schedule. As for the restoration of the dike section in the Communist area, it is far from the originally planned standard, and it is rumored that the entire dike section has been leveled, completely losing its flood prevention effectiveness. Once the water is officially released, the danger is worrying; (3) Dike-Closing Project: Due to the flood season, it was once suspended, and work was resumed in September after the major flood. However, due to the deep scouring of the dike entrance during the flood season, the water level rose from time to time after the flood, the difficulty of building a new line and transporting stone materials, the planned project progress has not been achieved. It is estimated that the completion of the dike will take place in mid-to-late January of this year. We are now working hard to overcome all difficulties and work day and night; (4) Communist Party of China's Dissent During the Dike-Closing Process: During the negotiations in Beijing, Shanghai, Bian, and Xin, the Communist Party of China expressed its support in principle for the dike-closing and restoration project, but it declared two or three times that the issues of dike-closing, dike restoration, and relocation of residents in the old riverbed must be considered and addressed comprehensively. In the past six months, the other party has repeatedly protested against the dike-closing and stone-throwing and digging of diversion canals in Huayuankou, firstly claiming that there was a shortage of engineering flour and the dike restoration could not be completed, and secondly claiming that they had not yet received the relocation fees and the residents in the riverbed could not be relocated. Their excuses for delaying and obstructing have not stopped at all; (5) Impact of Closing the Dike and Releasing Water on the Dike Section in the Communist Party Area: Before the restoration of the dike and the relocation of residents in the Communist Party area downstream are completed, once the dike is closed and water is released, no one can predict the situation that will occur under the direction of the Communist Party of China. Even if an agreement is reached again and work is rushed, it will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<h3>Relief Funds for Relocating Riverbed Residents to Be Disbursed Soon; UNRRA Corrects Dong Biwu's Protests</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] UNRRA and representatives of the Communist Party of China have been negotiating a plan to provide relief to riverbed residents in Shanghai for several days and have now reached an agreement. Relief funds will be transported and disbursed soon.</p>
<p>[Our City] News: Yesterday, Mr. Dong Biwu, the representative of the Communist Party of China, suddenly issued a protest letter in Beijing to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Water Conservancy Commission. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited the spokesman of UNRRA, who gave the following statement:</p>
<p>"The protest letter issued by Mr. Dong Biwu is broad, and the issue of water release at Huayuankou belongs to the scope of the project. This office has not yet received a report and is investigating. However, the section on the riverbed residents' relief fund mentioned by Mr. Dong involves the business of this office and must be explained in order to clarify the truth to all parties: After the riverbed residents' relief fund was submitted to the government for approval in November last year, Director Huo of this office immediately invited representatives of the Communist Party of China, General Egerton of UNRRA, and the person in charge of the Water Conservancy Commission to discuss the implementation plan. They unanimously agreed that two-thirds of the total amount would be issued on January 5 of this year, and the remainder would be issued at the end of January of this year. Once the principle was established, the specific implementation plan was discussed. Since November 23 of last year, six meetings have been held, but unexpectedly, difficulties have been encountered each time, and new problems have been constantly raised, so that this office's hope to solve the problem of relieving the riverbed residents has not yet been realized. Representatives from UNRRA attended each of the above six meetings and knew the crux of the matter like the back of their hands. No matter how many side issues arose, this office always sought compromise in order to benefit the disaster victims. During the negotiation process, the basic position of this office was based on the principle agreed upon in the past by former Director Jiang Yanfu and Mr. Zhou Enlai (that is, relief materials and funds must be directly given to the people in need of relief by this office). Other than this, nothing is impossible to concede...</p>
<p>The above is the actual situation of the negotiation process. Mr. Dong's protest letter states that 'UNRRA is using side issues to delay the riverbed relief fund until now,' which is obviously inconsistent with the actual situation. The government has already allocated the first phase of funds for the relief of riverbed residents to this office long ago. According to the person in charge, negotiations have largely agreed, and if no new problems arise, the disbursement will begin soon. I only hope to sympathize with the suffering of the people and facilitate the smooth completion of the relief plan."</p>
<h3>Huang Hua Returns to Peiping from Handan; Says the Water Release Issue Is Serious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Peiping, 6th] A member of the Communist Party of China's military delegation in Handan returned to Peiping yesterday. According to reports, after the Yellow River returned to its old course and water was released from the Second Diversion River on the 28th of last month, it has formed another serious problem. If the government does not allow the Communist Party's request (that is, closing the Diversion River mouth and reissuing 15 billion yuan for the relocation of riverbed residents and the remaining 4 billion yuan for dike repair), and postpones the dike closure for five months, the Communist Party will take appropriate action. It was also stated that the water flow is not fast, with an average depth of about one meter and a maximum width of about 20 li. There are about 600,000 residents in the riverbed in the Communist area, and more than 7 million residents on both sides. Shi Shushi, Zhou Enlai's representative, went to the front line from Handan on the 3rd at the call of Liu Bocheng to discuss countermeasures. Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 18th Army Group, is currently in Handan.</p>

<h3>The Procuratorate of the Nanjing High Court Interrogates Traitor Ding Mocun</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Procuratorate of the Capital High Court once interrogated the traitor Ding Mocun at 11:30 AM on the 6th, based on a telegram from the Military Statistics Bureau, concerning investigations into the location of the grave of the late Dai Jingyuan, a member of the Bureau who died in Shanghai.

<h3>To Regulate Civilian Needs and Balance Grain Prices, The Northeast Decides to Establish Ever-Normal Granaries</h3>
<p>Purchasing Agricultural Grain at Market Prices to Avoid Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Commodity prices in the Northeast have been rising frequently recently. However, the prices of agricultural products, which are the source of livelihood for farmers, have not kept pace with general prices, making farmers' livelihoods increasingly difficult. In the past, one stone of grain could be exchanged for three bolts of cloth, but today, one bolt of cloth can be exchanged for one stone of grain. The phenomenon of low grain prices harming farmers has become a serious threat to the rural Northeast. With this in mind, the economic authorities in the Northeast plan to establish ever-normal granaries in the near future to regulate civilian needs and balance grain prices. According to Liang Jingzheng, Director of the Field and Grain Department of the Economic Commission: The establishment of ever-normal granaries is not for fiscal purposes, but purely for economic purposes. The government has absolutely no intention of profiting from it. In the future, the purchase of grain will not be handled by local governments to avoid mismanagement that harms farmers, or to repeat the Japanese era's collection system that exploited farmers, nor will it be purchased by large companies. The ever-normal granary method is to purchase at market prices, allowing farmers to store grain, and to sell it at fair prices during times of shortage to suppress grain prices. If managed properly, it will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood in profound and far-reaching ways.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Rescue Airplanes! Rescue Lives!</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiaqian</p>
<p>The unfortunate incidents in China's aviation industry last year occurred one after another, which was indeed too serious. As early as the beginning of spring last year, General Dai Li died in a plane crash. Before and after this incident, two other airline planes and one transport plane of the Aeronautical Affairs Commission crashed. After a plane of the Central Company crashed in Changxing County on December 14, another plane of the Central Company and two planes of the China Company were destroyed in this city on Christmas Day, resulting in more than 80 casualties. Only a few days into this year, and on the morning of the 5th, another China Company Shanghai-Ping Plane crashed near Qingdao, killing all 43 crew members and passengers. Reports said, "The flesh and blood were blurred and unrecognizable," and the tragic situation can be imagined. One airplane after another crashes, piles upon piles of dead people appear, and batches upon batches of property are lost. How can this not be shocking! China's airplanes are already few in number, and purchasing more is also very expensive. If such losses continue, won't we be depleted? China's aviation industry is just beginning. The appearance of piles upon piles of dead people will surely make those who intend to fly retreat. If an even more important figure in the country also dies in a plane crash, wouldn't that be a loss that the country and the nation can never compensate for? Therefore, after the repeated plane crashes today, we cannot but shout loudly: "Quickly rescue the airplanes! Rescue the lives!"</p>
<p>Rescuing airplanes is not difficult. Just analyze the causes of the plane crashes, and it will be easily understood. The causes of several plane crashes in China last year have been recorded in the newspapers. In summary, it is nothing more than bad weather. The cause of the crash of the China Company Shanghai-Ping Plane in Qingdao the other day was still due to weather (fog). It can be seen that if we want to rescue airplanes that have not yet crashed and the lives of people who have not yet died, we can only pay attention to the weather. Although the weather cannot be created by human power, nor is it easy to change by human power, it can be investigated by human power and can be predicted by human power. The accuracy of prediction has already reached more than 90%. Except for minor details, the changes in weather that can affect flight safety can be completely predicted. Just imagine, if before the airplane takes off, the weather conditions along the way and at the destination can be known clearly, where would there be a foolish pilot like a "moth to a flame"?</p>
<p>In recent years, most of the airplane crashes in the United States have been due to weather conditions. Therefore, they seek safety in navigation by paying attention to the weather. Each airline company has meteorological personnel who are specially responsible for weather observation and forecasting. Before each airplane takes off, they must go to the meteorological personnel's office to check the weather map and listen to the meteorological personnel's explanation of the weather and instructions for the flight, so that the pilot knows the weather conditions along the way and at the destination clearly before taking off. Recently, the dispatchers of various airports in the United States (i.e., the personnel who control whether airplanes take off or not) have also been replaced by meteorological personnel to increase the authority of the meteorological personnel so that they can control whether airplanes take off or not based on the weather conditions. As for these few recent airplane crashes, although they were due to poor weather, this kind of weather was neither sudden nor something that the meteorological aspect could not pay attention to. Take the matter on Christmas Day as an example: the Meteorological General Station of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense had already said in the radio weather forecast on the 24th that the visibility was only one mile. The broadcast forecast at 11:00 AM on the 25th even clearly stated that the visibility would drop to half a mile and three-sixteenths of a mile, making landing very difficult. The heavy fog in Qingdao the other day is a common phenomenon in the morning of winter. It is very easy to dissipate when the sun rises for a long time. Unfortunately, the aviation companies in our country have not yet earnestly carried out meteorological work, let alone the various measures before the airplanes take off in the United States. Therefore, in addition to the harm caused by darkness and poor visibility, morning fog can also cause accidents. Without talking about the past, the transportation authorities should learn from the lessons of the previous airplane crashes, urge the aviation companies to pay close attention to the weather and carry out meteorological work, rescue the airplanes that have not crashed, and rescue the lives that have not been sacrificed. Even if it slightly increases the expenses, it is better than losing 2.5 billion yuan at a time and also losing dozens of lives!</p>
<h3>Review of Shanghai's Municipal Health Administration</h3>
<p>— Zhou Li</p>
<p>From the first meeting of the Municipal Council to now, half a year has passed in a flash. During these six months, the various measures of the municipal authorities have had commendable aspects and disappointing aspects. Now, let's explore the health aspects. Our overall impression of the city's health administration is that there are many words and few actions, and in practice, there are more changes in organization and personnel and less progress in business.</p>
<p>Health work is the most practical work, and there is no need for "many words." We believe that the person in charge of the Health Bureau will not build castles in the air when facing the countless practical problems of Shanghai. However, the plan proposed to us by the Health Bureau is a "Twenty-Five Year Plan." Twenty-five years is a long time. In this era of drastic changes, for many factors related to the plan itself, not to mention being unable to control, it is also impossible to grasp. Therefore, saying that the plan will last for twenty-five years is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>Looking back at reality. First, in terms of pharmaceutical management, for example, the control of hospitals and clinics. There are clear regulations in the central government's laws and regulations: what is a clinic, what is a hospital. Many so-called hospitals in Shanghai can only be called clinics in terms of equipment and conditions. According to the law, the Health Bureau must review and correct this. And this is a very easy thing to do. However, as far as we know, some hospitals that are not hospitals have been approved and registered by the Health Bureau under their original names. Just look at the list of hospitals published in the newspaper that are treating opium addicts, and you can know this fact. In terms of drug management, the central government also stipulates in laws and regulations that finished medicines without a license are not allowed to be sold. The responsibility for inspection and crackdown also belongs to the local health authorities. There are many unqualified drugs sold in Shanghai, but the Health Bureau does not interfere. The best thing is that drug advertisements must be checked by the Health Bureau before they can be published in the newspaper, but the Health Bureau also lightly passes drugs that have not obtained a license. The so-called "Setapyrine," a special drug for treating tuberculosis, is an example. It was not until later, when the pharmaceutical industry made trouble and there were severe criticisms from the public, that the Health Bureau began to register and announce that it would implement drug management. From these two things, we can see the slow pace of the Health Bureau's actions.</p>
<p>Shanghai's public medical undertakings, at the beginning of the victory, used the institutions left over from the enemy and puppet era as a foundation and reorganized and enriched them, which had already possessed a considerable scale. However, in the past six months, almost all of these municipal hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, etc., have had personnel problems and funding problems, especially the economic difficulties that have forced these undertakings to falter. Originally, the Health Bureau adopted a mandatory "self-sufficiency" policy for all of these medical institutions. The so-called "self-sufficiency" means that the Health Bureau does not give money, and each hospital must find its own way to find money in order to maintain survival. This decision made the hospital authorities heartache, and especially the general public heartache. On the one hand, we heard the Health Bureau's plan to add hospitals and increase beds. On the other hand, we saw the Health Bureau wanting patients to bear the expenses of the municipal hospitals. On the one hand, we heard the people in charge of health administration constantly saying that they wanted to implement a public medical system. On the other hand, we only saw them using the principle of "self-sufficiency" to tell the hospitals to close their doors to the poor! In addition, the health authorities have not been able to make proper use of relief materials; for example, for the enemy-operated pharmacies that have been taken over, we knew in the past that there was a drug supply office that used the houses and drugs to serve the citizens for a while. Now, the drug supply office has been canceled, and those houses are said to have mostly been used as staff dormitories, and some are still closed, along with the original materials, piled up with dust.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of health care and disease prevention, we know that the health authorities have paid great attention to disease prevention work in the past six months. When it comes to disease prevention achievements, they seem to be very proud of themselves, so let's start with disease prevention. We cannot deny that when cholera occurred in Shanghai last year, the disease prevention personnel of the Health Bureau worked day and night and did a lot of hard work, and it is obvious that the epidemic did not expand because of the containment efforts, most importantly, there was considerable preparation at the beginning. We would like to offer two suggestions here: 1. There should be a regular plan for disease prevention, and it should not only be a temporary response. 2. Various disease prevention facilities should be maintained as needed. Under the principle of hospitals being "self-sufficient," it is absolutely unreasonable to ask the two infectious disease hospitals to be self-sufficient as well.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of environmental hygiene: for example, the cleanliness of streets and alleys has not been resolved half a year ago, it has not been resolved half a year later, and it seems to be more serious, even without a solution. It is not that the sanitation workers are unwilling to serve diligently, but we have never seen them exert the greatest work efficiency for the public. The Health Bureau has recently come up with a method called "Cleanliness Zone Control," trying to marry this responsibility to the poorly organized Pao-Chia heads. We think that "Cleanliness Zone Control" is an interesting concept, but if it is implemented, because the Pao-Chia themselves are not healthy enough, I am afraid that the cleaning work will only get worse and worse. Not to say that such a new system of "Cleanliness Zone Control" is difficult to implement, even calling for building a trash can in every neighborhood, after mobilizing for so many days, has not been completed. However, we think that building trash cans is not too difficult, the difference seems to be that the municipal authorities are not督促 enough. From the trash cans, we think of public toilets. Shanghai is a vast urban area, and the number of public toilets is insufficient. To this end, the municipal government has allocated huge sums of money to the Health Bureau, ordering it to choose a location to add public toilets. We know that the Health Bureau has already received this special fund, but it has not been used on public toilets. It is said that it was used for disease prevention work, and it is also said that it was transferred to purchase garbage trucks. No matter where it is used, we always feel that adding public toilets is really necessary, and this measure of the municipal government is correct. The Health Bureau did not follow the original plan to implement, and it is wrong to transfer funds for designated purposes to other uses.</p>
<p>Then there is the collection and transportation of feces. The Health Bureau has not made any progress in this regard in the past six months. The extortion of the night soil carriers is still the same, and the leakage of the night soil trucks is still the same. Fundamentally, the Health Bureau has been hesitant about whether to maintain the city's management of this business or solicit business to contract it out in the past six months. In the past, Shanghai's night soil business has always been contracted out to merchants. Because there were many drawbacks in business, after the victory, the Health Bureau resolutely took it over for self-management, which was indeed a wise measure. However, once the head of the Health Bureau changed, the merchants' discussion followed, and later this discussion suddenly stopped; but recently, I heard that it was decided to change it to commercial management. The Health Bureau is continuing to run it itself, and then it wants to solicit merchants to contract it out. I don't know why it has changed so many times?</p>

<h3>Suzhou Holds First Public Trial of Prominent Figure for Extortion Case; Defendant Completely Reverses Previous Confession; Witnesses Suspected of Colluding in Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] The notorious case of celebrity Fan Junbo extorting a huge sum of money from an illegal underground bank, after being investigated twice by the Wu County District Procuratorate and found to be true, the District Court's Criminal Division held its first public trial this afternoon at 2:00 PM after indicting Fan Junbo on charges of fraud. The defendant, Fan Junbo, and witnesses Wang Yizhi, Lu Tiesun, and Wu Bingzhang, all reported on time for questioning. However, it seemed that they had colluded beforehand and completely overturned their original confessions in the City Defense Department and the District Procuratorate, claiming that Fan had borrowed from Wang Yangzhi and the other two in a private capacity, etc., causing Judge Wang Xiuqing presiding over the trial to become extremely angry. In addition to refuting Fan's testimony one by one, he also warned the three witnesses, Wang Yangzhi, Lu Tiesun, and Wu Bingzhang, that they were suspected of colluding in fraud. As a result, the court ordered that related parties such as the Li Zhenji Clothing Store be summoned for questioning, and adjourned the trial until a later date. The defendant Fan Junbo was still released on bail by the original three shop guarantors, and the others were ordered to return and await summons.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] In recent days, the prices of rice and flour in Suzhou have skyrocketed. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the lives of the poor are difficult to imagine. Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has received a report and specifically telegraphed the local county government today, ordering it to immediately convene the Rice and Grain Trade Association and relevant agencies upon receipt of the telegram to earnestly discuss effective suppression methods, strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation, strengthen control, and the county government, upon receiving the telegram, convened an emergency meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee this afternoon and decided on various emergency measures.</p>
<h3>Training Technical Personnel to Use Hydraulic Machinery; The Water Conservancy Commission Will Establish a Training Class in Haining</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will ship a large number of hydraulic engineering machinery to China this year, most of which will be allocated to the Yellow River, followed by the Qiantang River, and then the Pearl River, Yangtze River, and Huai River. If they can be used well, they will play a major role in the history of construction engineering in China, leading us out of the naive era of manual construction and into the mechanical era. Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, therefore specifically suggested that the Water Conservancy Commission establish a technical personnel training class in Haining. Chairman Xue Yuyu agreed to allocate additional funds. According to Wang's words to the reporter, there is no problem with funds and teachers. The school site is decided to be located beside the Sea God Temple, with the repair workshop of the Seawall Engineering Bureau as the laboratory, and mobile houses as dormitories, specializing in training machinery driving and young engineers, so as to cultivate technical talents and build a new China of machinery.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] The quarrying project of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau in Tangshan, Fuyang is progressing smoothly. Two transport ships have already been allocated for transportation today, and 15 barges, and trucks are also not a big problem. It is also reported from Tangshan that iron ore was discovered during quarrying, but the ore layer is still thin. If a large number of ore deposits are encountered in the future, it will be possible to find a way to mine them, which is an unexpected harvest.</p>
<h3>Wenling Borrows and Sells Tax Grain to Pay Civil Servants' Salary Arrears</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wenling Office] The living expenses of the employees of the various agencies affiliated to the Wenling County Government have been delayed due to the difficult local finances, causing the employees to repeatedly urge the county government to issue them. It is now learned that the county government, in order to cope with urgent needs, plans to allocate 900 shi of field tax grain, divided into six districts: Wenjiao, Taiping, Zeguo, Panlang, Zhuhong, and Xinhe, each allocating 150 shi, to be sold and converted into money to pay salaries. The price of the public sale was assessed at 18,900 yuan per shi, and the public bidding and sale will be held on January 6.</p>
<h3>Changshu has 920,000 People, 16,000 Conscripts</h3>
<p>[Report from our Changshu Office] The county government has completed the annual household registration statistics for the entire county at the end of the year, with a total of 82 townships, 994 pao, 15,075 chia, 307,281 households, 464,747 males, 456,902 females, totaling 921,649 people, including 16,267 conscripts.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Tianmu Mountain</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] West Tianmu Mountain in Zhejiang Province runs across Lin'an and Yuqian and is a famous scenic spot in the country. However, it was a guerrilla area during the Anti-Japanese War, and there are still many scars and the scenery is greatly diminished. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to reorganize East and West Tianmu Mountain, restore the original forests, protect the existing forests, repair tourist routes, and build hostels in West Tianmu Mountain, designating the mountain as a protected forest area. The Construction Department is preparing detailed plans.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Tenant Farmers Resist Rent; Landlords Request Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] More than a thousand landlords in Suzhou recently sent a telegram to the Provisional Council in the joint names of Shen Yizhuang and Fan Yizhuang, stating that since the collection of rent began on November 11 last year, it has been 50 days. However, due to the tenant farmers' united resistance to payment, the average collection rate across the county is only about 20%, making promotion difficult and causing deep anxiety. Furthermore, most landlords rely on winter rent for their daily needs, and some even live beyond their means, borrowing to make ends meet. Now the year is coming to an end, and the collection of grain taxes is very urgent. However, taxes come from rent, and rent comes from land. If there is no relief, it will not only affect the payment of grain taxes, but also have serious direct and indirect consequences for the survival of landlords and the adjustment of the entire social economy. The request is that the council quickly consult with the county government to strengthen the mediation mechanism and implement compulsory rent collection in order to maintain rent and taxes.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Strengthens Fisheries Protection; Under the Unified Coordination of the Water Police Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] In order to strengthen maritime security and protect the livelihoods of fishermen in Zhejiang Province, fishing protection vessels are being purchased and allocated to the Water Police Bureau for application. Personnel and weapons are also under the unified coordination and allocation of the Bureau. With the exception of the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas, where the aftermath of the fishing protection team still exists and there are still special forces, the fishing protection teams in other counties are not established. The fishing protection teams organized by the counties approved by the Seventh and Eighth District Commissioners are planned to be temporarily set up, referring to the Wenling example, and will still be under the unified management of the Water Police Bureau, and will be supervised and directed by the District Commissioners and the Fisheries Bureau, and the expenses will be the responsibility of the Fishermen's Association.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Land Registration to be Completed in Four Months</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Office] The Land Consolidation Office of this county is handling land registration in 21 townships in the urban area. In addition to issuing ownership certificates in Zhongyi, Zhonger, Zhongsanyi, and Zhongsiyi towns, the rest are still in the public announcement period. However, the land administration in Wuxi was largely destroyed during the enemy and puppet period, resulting in more than a thousand land dispute cases, which are currently being mediated separately. The Provincial Land Administration Bureau specifically stipulated that the registration period in this county is four months, which will be the end, and then land registration in the four townships will be handled.</p>
<h3>Bao Shan and Jia Ding Counties Urge the Establishment of Public Opinion Organizations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Bao Shan correspondent] The county government has repeatedly ordered various townships and towns in this county to complete the establishment of public opinion organizations within a set deadline and report back.

Therefore, separate telegrams have been sent to the heads of various townships and towns, setting a deadline of January 10 for the completion of the establishment of public opinion organizations.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jia Ding correspondent] The list of candidates for Type A and Type B public positions in this county has recently been submitted by the county government to the provincial government for approval and promulgation. The list includes 307 candidates for Type A positions, such as Gao Xiao-da, and 2298 candidates for Type B positions, such as Wu Bao-zhen. The county government has been dispatching personnel to various township and town people's representative conferences in recent days to actively supervise and guide the legal election of representatives. The deadline for completion is January 10, in order to continue the election of county councilors and formally establish a democratically elected county council.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County's Land Tax to Impose Late Payment Surcharges</h3>
<p>[Report from our Min Hang correspondent] Regarding the Shanghai County land tax for the 35th year of the Republic, the county government began collecting it as early as September 15th of last year. However, although more than three months have passed, only two-fifths of the total tax amount for the entire county has been paid. It is now learned that the county government, according to provincial government regulations, will impose a 5% late payment surcharge on all land taxes paid from now until the end of this month. If payment is still not made after the deadline, a 10% late payment surcharge will be imposed. If payment is not made within two months of the deadline, a 20% late payment surcharge will be imposed. In order to facilitate tax payments for farmers, the county government has decided to temporarily postpone the closure of land tax offices in Min Hang, Bei Qiao, Qiao Qiao, San Lin, Chen Hang, and other places.</p>
<h3>Nan Chang to Po Yang and Le Ping Shipping Routes to Use Shallow-Draft Steamers</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wu Yuan correspondent] The shipping route from Nan Chang to Po Yang, Le Ping has recently been experiencing difficulties due to the shallow waters of the lake. In order to facilitate water transportation, shipping companies have jointly formed a company to create more than a dozen shallow-draft steamers and new-style wooden barges to exclusively operate on this route. The cost of building each steam barge is estimated to be over 20 million yuan. Shipping from Jing De Zhen and Wu Yuan to Rao Zhou is also experiencing delays due to the low water levels in the winter river. Freight charges have increased by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per shi (unit of weight), and many boatmen have suspended operations due to frequent official duties along the way.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Mao Gong Continues to Inspect Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Report from our Yang Zhou correspondent on the 6th] Wang Mao Gong did not return to Zhen on the 4th. Instead, he went from Yang Zhou to Gao You, where he inspected the self-defense forces in Xian Nv Miao despite the rain. On the morning of the 5th, he went from You to Xing Hua and will return south to inspect Yi Zheng, Liu He, and Chang Heng.</p>
<h3>Ancient Coins Unearthed in Nan Zhao - A Jar of Coins with Brilliant Green Patina - Workers Get a Windfall and Grab Everything</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kai Feng correspondent] Nan Zhao County in Henan Province decided to repair its old and dilapidated city walls and deepen the city moat to prepare for emergencies. Recently, more than a hundred workers were excavating the city moat in the south of the eastern gate when they suddenly discovered an ancient magnetic jar about six feet deep in the soil. The jar was filled with ancient coins, with a brilliant green patina that was dazzling to the eye. At that moment, the workers, considering this a sudden windfall, rushed to grab the coins. In an instant, the entire jar of ancient coins was emptied. The ancient coins were covered in seal script inscriptions and a magnificent rust patina. Some said they were ancient coins from the Han Dynasty, while others claimed they were coins from the time of Cheng Yao Jin during the Tang Dynasty. Opinions varied, and no one could agree. However, it is a pity that these ancient artifacts have been scattered into the hands of workers. It is hoped that archaeologists will investigate and appraise them.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Assembly Concludes - All 117 Proposals Passed</h3>
<p>[Report from our He Fei correspondent on the 6th] The second session of the Anhui Provincial Assembly closed on the afternoon of the 5th. The session lasted a total of 17 days. In addition to listening to reports on the administration of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government, a total of 204 proposals were submitted, which were discussed and merged into 117 proposals, all of which were passed and sent to relevant parties for implementation.

Finally, Councilor Jin Wei Nong delivered a reply. The policy inquiries and proposal debates of the past seventeen days came to a successful conclusion.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Skyrocket - Increase of 10,000 Yuan at Once</h3>
<p>[Report from our Ru Gao correspondent] Amid rising prices everywhere, rice prices in Ru Gao have also recently skyrocketed. Ordinary rice has increased from 40,000 to 50,000, a jump of 10,000 yuan at once. Previously, rice prices in the city fluctuated, but only by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. This sudden jump of 10,000 yuan is due to the stimulation of other high prices. The situation is that the price of goods from other places has generally increased, and the rice price ratio has fallen sharply. Many farmers are unwilling to sell at this time and speculators are vying to hoard, resulting in a very scarce supply from the river in recent days. Merchants from Nan Tong and Bai Pu are eagerly purchasing, creating an unprecedented price surge, which is unlikely to fall in the short term.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Tun Xi Donate Funds to Help Dispersed Soldiers Return Home</h3>
<p>[Report from our Tun Xi correspondent] The Seventh District Commissioner's Office is handling the repatriation of dispersed officers and soldiers. The number of registered individuals has reached 180. Since the 19th of last month, vehicles have been dispatched to send them to Wu Hu, and then transferred to Han Kou. The travel expenses provided are being donated by local businesses, who have pledged 1 million yuan, and wealthy households in townships and towns, who have pledged 500,000 yuan. In addition to free transportation from Tun Xi to Wu Hu, each person is provided with 3,000 yuan per day for travel expenses for adults and 2,000 yuan for children.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Loans for Each County in the Tenth District of Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hai Ning correspondent] The provincial government previously allocated 10 million yuan in small-scale water conservancy loans to the counties in the Tenth District. The Tenth District Commissioner's Office has allocated the loan amounts based on the actual needs of each county. The allocations have now been announced. The allocations are as follows: Hai Ning 3 million yuan, Jia Shan and Chong De 2.5 million yuan each, Tong Xiang 2 million yuan. The loans have been approved and issued by the Hangzhou branch of the China Farmers Bank.</p>
<h3>Feng Xian County Orphanage Performs a Play to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from our Feng Xian correspondent] The Feng Xian County Orphanage was reorganized from an orphanage and houses more than 40 orphaned children. However, due to limited funding, it is difficult to maintain. Therefore, the orphanage requested the Mu Xian Reclamation Opera Troupe to perform famous plays on the 3rd and 4th to raise funds. Tickets are priced at 10,000 and 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Many Cigarette Factories Suspend Operations - Impacting Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kai Feng correspondent] The tax revenue in Henan Province for the first ten months of the 35th year of the Republic should have been 16,899,887,905 yuan according to the budget, but the actual revenue was only 14,418,520,189.91 yuan. This is a shortfall of 1,481,367,715.09 yuan. According to the person in charge of the tax bureau, cigarette tax is the main source of tax revenue in the province. Recently, due to the influx of British and American tobacco into the mainland, monopolizing the market, the domestic tobacco industry has been greatly affected. Currently, more than one-third of the cigarette factories in Henan Province have suspended operations, so tax revenue has also decreased accordingly. As for mining taxes in Henan Province, the coal mine taxes from Liu He Gou and Jiao Zuo are the largest. However, these two places were only recently recovered, and the mining taxes are still being organized.</p>

<p>[Poverty-Stricken People Should Get a Price Reduction for Quitting Smoking]</p>
<p>Recently, my relative received a notice from the police station stating that registered smokers must apply to designated public and private hospitals for examination within the year; otherwise, they will be severely punished. My relative immediately inquired about the prices at public and private hospitals, which generally charged as much as 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. While there are many wealthy smokers, there are also many poor and unemployed smokers. Moreover, with the Lunar New Year approaching, prices are soaring, and people are struggling to meet their basic needs, so how can they afford this heavy burden? The ruling authorities should be thorough in eliminating evil, and should act swiftly. However, the economic capacity of the common people should also be taken into account. Therefore, I would like to request that the authorities quickly establish measures to assist poor smokers, and require all hospitals to comply, so as to urge those who are unable to afford it to quit smoking in a timely manner, which will benefit the prohibition policy and is not insignificant. (Wu Mei-weng)</p>
<p>[How Can Poor Teachers Get Through the Lunar New Year?]</p>
<p>We are a group of poor teachers, and our monthly income is only over 100,000 yuan. With the high prices of everything today, we are really suffering. We are very concerned about the news of salary adjustments and hope that they can be implemented soon!</p>
<p>However, every time salary adjustments are announced, we have to wait one or two months before we can receive the increased salary. How much of a discount will this be against the soaring prices? The loss is on our shoulders again, and we can only endure it. Especially now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, we need a sum of money even more. Therefore, we hope that we can get an emergency loan before we receive the new standard salary, so that we can barely get through this Lunar New Year. This is what we ask of the education authorities. (A Group of Poor Teachers)</p>
<p>[Please Improve the Transportation on Qi Pu Road]</p>
<p>Qi Pu Road in this city was blockaded and severely damaged by the enemy during the war. It was reopened after victory last year, but the road surface is uneven and muddy after rain, making it difficult to pass. Also, because the Zhejiang Road Bridge restricts vehicles from passing, they must go around Qi Pu Road, creating a situation where the road is narrow and cars are crowded, which is very dangerous for pedestrians. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this and quickly improve it to facilitate transportation. (Feng Wu-qing)</p>
<p>[Request to Sell Surplus Materials]</p>
<p>I previously read in the newspaper that the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau, in order to facilitate the purchase of surplus daily necessities by the people in various districts nearby, entrusted various stores to sell them, which is truly a blessing for the people. Our cooperative is located in the Ti Lan Qiao area and has many members. We sent a letter to the bureau requesting to sell the materials, but we were rejected, which surprised us greatly. We think that cooperatives are also organizations that seek the welfare of the people, so why do they not have the right to sell? Therefore, we are taking this opportunity to appeal to the authorities to answer our questions and dispel the doubts of the group. At the same time, we hope that cooperatives in every district of Shanghai can enjoy the right to sell surplus materials, so as to resist the black market. Then the people will be very fortunate. (The Eighteenth District Cooperative)</p>

<h3>Developing Highway Transportation in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Report from Ru Gao, by our correspondent Wang Han-ou</p>
<p>"Adversity builds a nation" - this is an old saying. Despite the many difficulties, the highway business in Northern Jiangsu is developing in a new and different way. This is a miracle. Ever since the National Army troops marched and stationed themselves in various counties in Northern Jiangsu, the thing that many people were most concerned about was the transportation issue of Northern Jiangsu. It's because the transportation business in Northern Jiangsu was already less developed than in the Jiangnan area before the war. After two times of unrest, boats were almost all destroyed, and highways were dug up into a scattered mess. Restoring water and land transportation was truly not an easy thing to do. Who knew that the reality was contrary to what was imagined? Due to the efforts of military and political authorities overcoming the difficulties, and along with the enthusiastic help of people from various places, highway lines were laid out like stars in the sky in all directions everywhere where the National Army stationed.</p>
<p>[Highways Reach in All Directions]</p>
<p>Currently, from Yangzhou and Nantong downward, the main trunk roads that have already been restored, the Yang Qing line and the Tong Yang line, are fully open to traffic. The Tong Yu line goes all the way to Yancheng. If the National Army troops in the eastern section of the Long Hai railway can join forces, then the highway traffic to Ganyu should be fully restored. Apart from that, branches connecting the three trunk lines, dozens of large and small ones, too many to count, for example, the short-distance highways that run from this county to the border of Jingtai, from Taixian to the riverfront of the port, from Donghe, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong to the beaches, are just like the harbor channels in Northern Jiangsu's inland rivers, branching and reaching in all directions.</p>
<p>Although some of these highways lack vehicles, so not all of them have commercial vehicles running, most of them already have passenger cars running. This is extremely convenient for merchants and travelers, creating a transportation development phenomenon exceeding what it was before the war. There are several reasons for this: first, people inside the pacified districts, are afraid that there might be instability along the way, so they all hope to take advantage of quick transportation tools - cars - to get there early. Second, many of the unemployed, squeezed out by the chaos of war, have all taken the road of running single errands, constantly washing and flowing. Third, those who were previously eating from the Jiangnan transportation and transit business, taking advantage of these many newly opened roads, have moved to Northern Jiangsu, hoping to find gold in this barren land.</p>
<p>[The Communist Army Cannot Destroy Them]</p>
<p>Although the Communist Army has the notorious name of "digging roads," their success in digging roads in Northern Jiangsu this time has proven to be an unusual failure. People are not like they were during the Anti-Japanese War, bravely helping the Communist Army destroy the highways. On the contrary, people have organized self-defense teams to help the government and the National Army protect the highways, and driven out the few Communist Army members and political workers who were waging guerilla warfare and setting up ambushes away from the sides of the highway. From this, one can see the longing for stability and aversion to chaos in the minds of the people of Northern Jiangsu, and the Communist Army's signs of military and political defeat in Northern Jiangsu. Up until now, many highways have watchtowers for guard posts along the way, which are faithfully guarded by the stationed troops and local self-defense teams. The phenomenon of highway bridges being destroyed and broken is even more non-existent.</p>
<p>The development of the highway business has indeed solved the livelihood problems of a large group of people, and at the same time it has also made many places abnormally prosperous. Currently, the most prosperous places in Northern Jiangsu are Sanzhou (Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou) and Haian town in Taixian, all these places are highway intersections. Rugao County was also a gathering point for highways in the past, but recently, because the Ru Xin (Xinsheng port road), and the Ru Li (Libao) roads have not been opened and not smooth, the train station south of the city has not been able to show its bustle. But there is already a large group of train station teahouse staff, employees, vendors, porters... who earn their daily income.</p>
<p>[Full of 'Wild Chicken' Cars]</p>
<p>There are so many big and small car companies on these highways, up to several hundred. The companies that are relatively better equipped are Yangzhou and Zhenyang, etc. Recently, they have been planning to organize intermodal transportation with the Jiangnan Nanjing and Shanghai Railway lines for the convenience of travelers. Next is the Nantong Central Company, etc. Inside the cars, there might still be a few seats. As for the rest, almost all of them are cargo trucks. People and goods are crammed together like piglets. Not only can't they sit down, sometimes they can't even stand steadily. There aren't even tarpaulins on top of the cars. When the wind blows and the rain falls, you just have to suffer enough. Sitting on them is far worse than the condemned fourth-class train in Jiangnan, but the price of a ride is often several times the price of a first-class ticket on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway.</p>
<p>This is because the management of the Northern Jiangsu Highway authorities is not strict enough. There are too many "wild chicken" car companies who don't abide by the traffic regulations and the official mileage fares. Some "wild chicken" 'companies' only have one car. They are all put together by a few empty-handed friends and unemployed car drivers. They rent an old truck from Shanghai for a monthly rent of one or two million yuan. But it is said that just by loading people and goods on a round trip from Nantong to Dongtai, they can earn a hundred or a few hundred million yuan. They only know how to desperately load people and goods, and earn more money. As for the load-bearing weight of the car body and highway bridges, and the safety of passengers, they don't care about anything. Recently, just on the Tong Yang line alone, there have been cases of bridges being broken, and car crashes and people being crushed.</p>
<p>[The Activity of 'Scalpers']</p>
<p>The order in some stations is especially chaotic. The power of the "scalpers" is even more fierce than in front of the Shanghai theaters. Originally, the stations for those wild chicken companies were all open air. The scalpers became the station masters, ticket sellers, and customer service tea house staff for the open-air companies. Foreign travelers who have not been to these places, as soon as you step onto those car concentration points in the small towns, someone will immediately come and ask you where you want to go. If you tell them where you are going, they will immediately say: "The car will leave in five minutes, the fare is so and so, please bring it here!" You give them the money for the ticket, but where is the ticket? He, the scalper, is the ticket. You have to follow him running here and there, until he takes you to a wild chicken car that is about to leave, and faces the car to settle the account, then you can climb into the car with peace of mind. Otherwise, you will definitely be taught to pay the car fare a second time.</p>
<p>Next, there is another problem worth noting: the highways in Northern Jiangsu are not as well maintained as those in Jiangnan. Eighty or ninety percent of them are dirt road surfaces. When it rains, there is simply no way to deal with it. Considering the current state of highway traffic development in Northern Jiangsu, the income from road maintenance fees must not be low. The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Authority had better start from now and seriously pay attention to improving the highway traffic in Northern Jiangsu, and first convert the main highways into gravel road surfaces. Apart from that, the management system of the stations, the mileage fares for passenger and cargo vehicles, and the departure times of passenger vehicles at each station must be strictly regulated. Alternatively, the highway authorities can send more passenger cars to operate on the various lines in Northern Jiangsu, and strictly prohibit scalpers from demanding and causing trouble, so that merchants and travelers can obtain ideal convenience.</p>
<p>Developed transportation promotes the advancement of civilization and culture. Closed-off and backward Northern Jiangsu truly needs to be transformed and developed after this chaos. Improving highway transportation is also one of the important administrative measures for developing Northern Jiangsu. In the future, it is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the highway authorities can pay more attention to this issue. (December 27th)</p>

<h3>Truman Addresses Congress - Elaborates on Outline of This Year's Administration - Urges Republican Party to Cooperate on Legislative Plans</h3>
<p>[Report from our source] San Francisco, broadcast on the 6th: President Truman addressed the joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives this afternoon, presenting an outline of this year's administration, involving as many as fifteen domestic and foreign issues. The President asked the two chambers for cooperation, otherwise national security would be jeopardized. The President pointed out the close relationship between the United States' domestic and foreign policies, saying: "The success of our domestic policies is closely linked to foreign measures. Given the fact that the United States leads the world, our work to maintain a sound and prosperous economy and improve people's livelihoods has greater significance. What we can and cannot do domestically is not only related to ourselves, but will also affect the whole world. If we want to accomplish our mission for ourselves and other nations, we must ensure that the United States is sound in terms of economics, society, and politics. Only in this way can we help create peaceful factors in other countries, factors which are political stability, and economic and social progress.</p>
<p>The peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary are ready, and these treaties will be signed in Paris next month, after which they will be submitted to the US Senate for approval. Our government believes that these treaties are not entirely satisfactory, but whatever their shortcomings, we are very willing for our wartime allies to reach an agreement, because any delay will endanger the political stability of the countries involved."</p>
<p>Regarding domestic issues, the main points are as follows: (1) Submit a labor law to the two chambers to prohibit strikes and establish a committee to investigate labor-management relations. (2) The new budget balances revenue and expenditure, recommending that wartime tax rules continue to be implemented after they expire on June 30. (3) Submit a new economic plan to the two chambers, requesting continued restrictions on patents and unfair business practices.</p>
<p>[Maintain Strong Military Force to Defend Against Lightning Strikes]</p>
<p>Regarding disarmament and world collective security, President Truman said: "We must maintain a strong military force until collective security under the United Nations is established. After that, the United States can lead the way in collective disarmament. But before this is achieved, the United States should not weaken its military force, lest it be attacked by other countries. In 1946, we completed the demobilization of wartime military forces, and now we only maintain a military force sufficient to defend ourselves and fulfill our international obligations. If countries with heavy responsibilities abandon their responsibilities, the stability of the world will be destroyed. In the current period, unpredictable attacks can come at unprecedented speed. We must have sufficient power to defeat such possible attacks. Therefore, we must ensure that our troops have excellent equipment and training, and mobilize all manpower in times of emergency. Before July 1, the number of army personnel will be reduced to 1.07 million, and the navy will be reduced to 571,000. The occupation forces stationed abroad are now only able to carry out the tasks required by our diplomatic policy. In any case, the responsibility for maintaining a sufficient military force lies with Congress."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Some observers believe that President Truman's speech has departed from the left-wing New Deal system led by Wallace and is increasingly closer to the right-wing conservative system led by Byrnes. When President Roosevelt was alive, Byrnes was a great help to Roosevelt in domestic affairs. Some people close to the President say that the President's domestic opinions are very similar to those of the moderate faction of the Republican Party. Therefore, it can be proved after the President's speech today that although the government and the parliament belong to different parties, cooperation in domestic affairs is still fully possible.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Issues Statement: Fully Supports Bipartisan Foreign Policy; U.S.-Soviet Relations Will Depend on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 4th] Congressman Eaton, the newly appointed chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently stated that he fully supports bipartisan foreign policy. He said that the House Foreign Affairs Committee is the body that creates important foreign policy legislation, and therefore should not have "political bias." Eaton, a Republican Congressman from New Jersey, recently filled the vacancy left by New York Democratic Congressman Bloom, becoming the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He told reporters last Friday that the United States should continue to pay close attention to affairs in Europe, Latin America, and the Far East, as everything in the aforementioned regions is enough to affect human management. He expressed his support for Byrnes, saying that the Secretary of State's steadfast and outstanding spirit in the most special circumstances has greatly improved U.S.-Soviet relations over the past year. Eaton continued: "I fully support Byrnes, and I have always been the strongest supporter of the current government's foreign policy. The House Foreign Affairs Committee should not have political bias." Eaton also said that future U.S.-Soviet relations will directly depend on the Soviet Union. He concluded, "We will deal with our friends and enemies based on the principle of 'repaying kindness with kindness and resentment with resentment.' If they treat us with friendship, we will reciprocate with friendship. If they treat us as enemies, we will reciprocate with hostility."</p>
<h3>International Economic Cooperation: U.S. Hopes for Soviet Participation</h3>
<p>No Two-Nation Trade World Allowed</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 5th] Wilcox, Director of the Office of International Trade Policy at the State Department, recently stated forcefully: "Political cooperation mechanisms are of little significance unless countries also cooperate economically." He outlined the progress of economic cooperation through international trade organizations and described the world economic ailments caused by economic isolationism. Wilcox spoke on a national radio question-and-answer program, first mentioning that the purpose of international trade organizations is to strive to eliminate the various restrictions and discriminations caused by the First and Second World Wars, such as import quotas, foreign exchange controls, and priority rights. All of these reduce trade, reduce labor productivity, and lower living standards. The focus of the discussion was on the recent meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Eighteen Nations in London, which was established to arrange the International Trade and Employment Conference to consider the establishment of an International Trade Organization. Another task of the committee is to draft the organizational law of the World Trade Organization, which will be prepared for the second meeting in Geneva in April. Regarding the work of the London conference, Wilcox said: "We have unanimously reached an agreement on about nine-tenths of the revised charter, including some of the clauses that some people consider most important. However, the drafting work will still not be completed before the committee resumes its meeting in Geneva in April." Another question was, "Do you think the Soviet Union will join the International Trade Organization?" Wilcox replied: "I don't know. But I think the Soviet Union must participate. The door to the organization is open, and the Soviet Union's participation will have great benefits and no losses." The question was, "If there is no Soviet Union, will there be any problems in establishing an international trade organization?" Wilcox replied: "There are indeed problems. The Soviet Union controls very little in world trade, not even five percent. But what we are seeking is of course a trade world, not a two-nation trade world."</p>

<h3>British Parliamentary Delegation Report: Advocates Early Withdrawal of British Troops from Greece; Greek People Fear Communism</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The British parliamentary delegation visited Greece in August of last year at the invitation of the Greek government and returned home early. It recently released a report stating: "This delegation believes that it is highly possible for British troops to withdraw from Greece at an early date. The Greek government should take the opportunity of King George II's return to the country to adopt a completely new policy, and with British support, recruit all parties and factions to form a coalition government. However, extreme leftists may be excluded. The new government should adopt a lenient policy towards government political prisoners. Its main task is to restore national order and the freedom that the people should enjoy in accordance with the constitution. British troops should be withdrawn at an early date unless unforeseen circumstances occur. The Greek referendum clearly showed that the majority of citizens supported King George II's return to the country for three reasons: (1) The Greek people hope for peace and order; (2) The Greek people believe that voting against the king is equivalent to voting against Britain and supporting the Soviet Union; (3) The Greek people all fear communism."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The United Nations Security Council will organize a committee to conduct an on-site investigation of the situation in Greece.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Visits the United States</h3>
<p>Hopes for Assistance from the United States</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi arrived at Washington Airport this afternoon and will stay in the U.S. capital for four days as a guest of the U.S. government.

<h3>New Continent of the 20th Century: U.S. Wants to Divide One Million Square Miles</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Officials here revealed that the United States intends to request a large portion of the six million square miles of the Antarctic continent. The strategy for obtaining this territory will be decided after Rear Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition returns. Officials in charge of Antarctic policy told an interviewer today that various meetings will be held next spring to discuss: (1) The date when the United States formally requests Antarctic ice land territory. (2) The proposal to submit international hostile demands to the United Nations for handling to avoid endless disputes. (3) The nature of future American surveys after the current naval expedition, and the efforts of occupation, and the immediate departure of a smaller expedition team under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ronne. Byrd, a major Antarctic explorer, is currently taking the aircraft carrier "Philippine Sea" to Antarctica to join the expeditionary force. The team is scheduled to return home in four months. The United States' territorial claims are largely based on the northwest region of the ice land, the area visited by explorers Ellsworth and Byrd. After surveying from 1939 to 1941, the two declared: The United States can at least claim one million square miles of the Antarctic continent, or even eight hundred thousand square miles more. The government's policy, based on the demands of American private explorers and surveyors, does not recognize the demands of Britain, France, Chile, Norway and other countries. This layer was reiterated by Undersecretary of State Acheson last week. One of the areas of direct dispute is in the area of ​​Magawright Bay, south of Cape Horn, where a British expedition has been excavating at the site of Byrd's early camp since 1943. Chile also intends to acquire the area, and Ronne's expedition team is targeting the area.</p>
<p>As for the entire issue of submitting it to the International Court of Justice for arbitration or to the United Nations for handling, it has been proposed by several parties. As of now, officials have unofficially stated that this is only under normal circumstances. The purpose of the countries involved in the Antarctic dispute is largely to use expedition teams for surveying and occupation to strengthen their territorial claims. Ronne's expedition team plans to stay at its destination for fourteen to eighteen months, or it will offset the effect of the British Meteorological expansion occupying the Magawright Bay base. After Byrd returns, he will participate in meetings to discuss whether to request Congress to allocate funds for exploration, which will be carried out according to a permanent military road plan, so as to establish permanent equipment to some extent. Future Pearl Harbor policy is based on this plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, Australia, 5th] The "Sydney Sun" reported today that Australia has requested to acquire one-third of the Antarctic continent and will oppose any proposal to place the Antarctic region under the management of the United Nations. The United Nations management of Antarctica was recently proposed by the "Washington Post". Australia is now sending patrols to the Antarctic region, followed by a larger expedition team, in order to claim approximately 2.5 million square miles of territory.</p>
<h3>Japan's Reparations Problem (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Nanjing, Chuan Junyi</p>
<p>The Potsdam Proclamation stipulates that in-kind reparations are one of the obligations that Japan should fulfill. Regarding the Japanese reparations policy, American reparations envoy Pauley released an interim report on December 6th of last year, stipulating that the materials to be removed as reparations targets are:</p>
<p>(1) Machine tool manufacturing capacity should be reduced by half (approximately 350,000 to 400,000 units). All equipment from army and navy arsenals, aircraft manufacturing plants, steel ball, axle factories, and aircraft engine factories should be removed.</p>
<p>(2) Steel plants with an annual output of more than 250 tons should be removed (currently producing 11 million tons).</p>
<p>(3) Twenty shipyards.</p>
<p>(4) Half of the thermal power generation capacity.</p>
<p>(5) Twenty out of the 41 newest caustic soda plants should be removed.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission in Washington also released a plan on August 20th. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander had already issued management orders in January of this year for 682 Japanese military-related factories, research institutes, and aircraft factories, designating them as reparations targets. Subsequently, on August 24th, an additional 25 shipyards, 275 private military factories, 9 machine tool factories, 20 steel ball factories, 24 steel plants, 1 alkali ash factory, 18 caustic soda factories, and 20 thermal power plants, a total of 505 factories, were designated as reparations factories. At the same time, two aircraft factories previously designated were added and 32 were removed. The total number of factories designated in the two rounds was 1,002. The designation was revised again on November 6th, and factories that did not meet the reparations standards were removed, reducing the number to 953 factories. A third revision was made on the 7th of this month. In addition to removing 12 from sulfuric acid, machine tool, precision steel ball factories, private military factories, two factories were added. The number of reparations currently designated is as follows:</p>
<p>Aircraft factories, army and navy arsenals, research and experimental institutes, 466.</p>
<p>Precision bearing factories, 31.</p>
<p>Shipyards, 24.</p>
<p>Sulfur factories, 41.</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid factories, 23.</p>
<p>Machine tool factories, 85.</p>
<p>Power plants, 20.</p>
<p>Private military factories, 230.</p>
<p>Steel manufacturing plants, 21.</p>
<p>Total, 943</p>
<p>According to the analysis of the "Gold Drill" economic magazine, the impact on Japanese industry after removing these nearly one thousand factories as reparations is that it will push Japan's economic level back more than ten years (Showa 12, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out).</p>
<p>The final Pauley plan released on November 28th is more detailed than the previous interim report, especially in the machinery, tools, iron and steel, railway vehicles, and chemical industries. In Pauley's previous report, only half of the existing machine tools were planned to be removed, totaling 350,000 to 400,000 units. In the final plan, 600,000 units are planned to be removed, leaving only 155,000 units. The steelmaking capacity of open-hearth furnaces will be reduced by 6 million tons, and the steelmaking capacity of electric furnaces will be reduced by 3 million tons. In Showa 19 (1944), the production capacity of open-hearth furnaces was 8 million tons, and the capacity of electric furnaces was 3 million tons. As a result, the annual production of steel ingots will be reduced to 2.25 million tons. In Showa 9 (1934), the consumption of steel materials was 3.155 million tons. According to Pauley's proposal, Japan's minimum consumption after this will be 3 million tons. As a result, Japan must import 1 million tons of steel materials from various Asian countries every year. In the railway vehicle sector, 970 locomotives and 30,000 freight cars will be distributed by the United Nations. After the war, Japan has 5,566 locomotives and 119,760 freight cars. Regarding the textile industry, the final report limits it to 3 million spindles. Before the war, Japan had approximately 12 million spindles of textile equipment, with 8 million spindles actually in operation. According to the estimates of the Toyo Keizai magazine, 6.5 million spindles are currently needed to maintain domestic needs and pay for imported raw cotton.</p>
<p>The following is a comparison of the Pauley plan released on December 28th, the Far Eastern Committee plan of August 20th, Showa 12 (1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out), and Japan's total production capacity in October of this year, as shown in the following table:</p>

Mr. Gray, who is in charge of the Oriental antiquities section of the museum, expressed great excitement about this gift, but due to limited space, these treasures cannot be publicly displayed for the time being. Among the artworks awaiting exhibition, the most noteworthy is a statue of the Tathagata Buddha, over 1,300 years old, which was donated to the British Museum by the Chinese government in 1935. At the same time, a portion of Chinese pottery, jade, bronzes, and various carvings have been on display for several months, the most important of which are bronzes and jades from the Shang and Yin dynasties, a calligraphy board personally inscribed by Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, and some of the finest Chinese pottery ever produced. An unparalleled lacquer box from the Han Dynasty has never been exhibited before. To solve the problem of space limitations, the exhibits are rotated every year or eighteen months. The British Museum also plans to open an art room in the near future to exhibit the best of Chinese paintings. In addition, the Victoria and Albert Museum also houses a large collection of Oriental pottery, mostly from China.</p>

<h3>參議會二次大會　隆重舉行開幕禮</h3>
<p>Solemn Opening Ceremony of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>出席議員一四七人　今日會議中對警教等局將提質詢</p>
<p>147 Councilors Present, Questions to be Raised to Police and Education Bureaus in Today's Meeting</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The First Session of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council opened at 9:30 am yesterday at Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road. The venue was far from the central district, and the weather was rainy and muddy yesterday, but the councilors showed great spirit. A total of 167 councilors registered for this session, with 147 attending yesterday. In addition, over twenty general managers and editors-in-chief of various newspapers, as well as prominent figures in society, were invited to attend, and the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government were also present. Before the opening of the assembly, a memorial week was held, with speeches delivered successively by Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, Director Fang, and Supervising Commissioner Cheng. After a ten-minute recess, Mayor Wu reported on the administration, which lasted for an hour. Councilors then raised questions one after another. The Mayor first made a brief overall reply, and detailed information will be answered separately by the directors of each bureau. The first meeting of the assembly adjourned at 12:45 pm.</p>
<p>潘議長開幕詞　希望完成責任</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's Opening Remarks, Hope to Fulfill Responsibilities</p>
<p>The memorial week was presided over by Speaker Pan. After performing the rituals, he delivered the opening remarks, stating: "It has been more than three months since the adjournment of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Government has been gradually implementing the resolutions proposed by the assembly. Today, the Second General Assembly opens in the new year, which is of great significance. As the saying goes, 'The plan for a year lies in the spring,' and the work for the year should be planned and decided at this time. Although the agenda of this meeting is only one week, its task is no less than that of the previous assembly. In addition to first discussing the central work plan proposed by the Municipal Government, the budget for the 36th year is particularly important. I hope that all colleagues will represent the opinions of all parties, considering both the burden on the people and the difficulties of the Municipal Government's administration, and fulfill the responsibilities that representatives should fulfill in this assembly. I would like to offer my personal opinions simply at the opening, and at the same time, I would like to ask the Mayor for more guidance so that it can be used as a reference during the meeting."</p>
<p>市長希望二點　達到繁榮市面</p>
<p>Mayor Hopes for Two Points, to Achieve Prosperous City</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating that he had two thoughts: "(1) When writing the history of Shanghai in the 35th year in the future, one will definitely think of the establishment and success of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council is a true institution, and all resolutions have been carefully reviewed and decided. The Municipal Government will also implement its work based on the opinions of the assembly. (2) The 36th year will be the most difficult and arduous year in the history of Shanghai. As the person in charge of administration, I feel that there are many difficulties. I hope that the Municipal Council will continue to provide guidance and assistance with the spirit of the previous assembly, so that the hope of stability and prosperity in Shanghai can be achieved."</p>
<p>方主委詞</p>
<p>Director Fang's Remarks</p>
<p>Director Fang then delivered a speech, stating: "The municipal councilors were elected by four million citizens of the city, and the citizens must be shouting behind them, 'Be sure to speak for the people.' Therefore, I hope that all councilors will give full play to their abilities, but I also hope that they can fully understand the government. The mayor is like a car driver, and the citizens are like sitting in the car. To make the car run well, there must be cooperation."</p>
<p>程監使詞</p>
<p>Supervising Commissioner Cheng's Remarks</p>
<p>Supervising Commissioner Cangbo Cheng also expressed his thoughts and congratulations, saying: "The 36th year is the year when China's democratic constitutional government begins, and the opening of Shanghai's public opinion organs in the new year symbolizes democracy. However, the country currently has two opposing trends: (1) Peaceful, unified democracy, and (2) Destruction of peaceful, unified democracy. Shanghai cannot be stable under the siege of various social ills. However, to stabilize China, Shanghai must be stabilized. Therefore, the responsibility of the Municipal Council is not only to discuss proposals, but also to put forth a lot of effort to stabilize Shanghai, so that many unfair things in society can be eliminated and the suffering of the people can be reduced. For example, in the hawker incident, the councilors did not avoid danger and went to investigate in person. This kind of spirit is admirable and should continue. This is a manifestation of stabilizing Shanghai. In addition, the chairman once indicated that Shanghai is extravagant and dissolute, and the social atmosphere is corrupt. Whenever officials and dignitaries encounter weddings and funerals, they are extravagant. This is not the glory of Shanghai but a shame. If it can be improved and the atmosphere can be changed, Shanghai can also be stabilized."</p>
<p>[Also News] The Second General Assembly of the First Shanghai Municipal Council is scheduled to hold its second meeting from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm today, to raise questions to the police, social welfare, and education bureaus. Before the meeting, the representatives attending the National Assembly will make a report.</p>
<h3>對不起參議員　對不起滬市民</h3>
<p>Apologies to Councilors, Apologies to Shanghai Citizens</p>
<p>吳市長作施政報告　檢討工作認為未盡滿意</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Makes Administrative Report, Reviews Work and Finds It Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, Mayor Wu continued to make his administrative report, which lasted for an hour, stating that he had done his best to accommodate the various resolutions of the Municipal Council's First General Assembly regarding municipal facilities. After three months, he reviewed the administration and found it unsatisfactory, especially regarding the issues of commodity prices, social order, hawker incidents, and the recent student unrest. He deeply felt that he had let down the Municipal Council and the citizens of Shanghai, but the various bureaus had made their best efforts within the realm of possibility. This should be specially mentioned before the report.</p>
<p>戶籍調查準確</p>
<p>Accurate Household Registration Survey</p>
<p>Regarding civil affairs: (1) Regarding the autonomous portion, there are currently 30 districts, 1,056 bao, and 24,963 jia in the baojia organization. Adjusting the district boundaries and surveying the boundaries between Jiangsu Province and this city, the police, education, health, and various sub-district divisions were coordinated with the autonomous district divisions. The various districts were ordered to establish district mediation committees to mediate civil and criminal disputes, build district office buildings, establish baojia regulations, and prepare for the election of district heads by the people. (2) Regarding household administration, the initial household registration and regular household registration were carried out. (3) Regarding military service, the implementation methods for the survey of young men in the 35th year, the preferential treatment of military dependents, and the establishment of military service sections and affiliated district bao teams were drafted. He had personally visited various districts, such as slums and shantytowns, and personally surveyed household registration. The results can be said to be 100% accurate. This is of great importance to the handling of grassroots organizations of local autonomy and is gratifying.</p>
<p>警政較前進步</p>
<p>Police Administration More Progressive Than Before</p>
<p>Regarding police administration: Actively promoting the inspection of civilian guns, the prevention and arrest of bandits, the rectification of prostitutes, the elimination of opium, the management of traffic, the improvement of the city appearance, the management of household registration, the management of special businesses, the organization of volunteer police, the establishment of criminal police brigades, the strengthening of new police training, the implementation of the police district system, the addition of fire-fighting equipment, and the strengthening of rescue work. The salaries of police officers are meager. Although they have been adjusted, they are still very low. The monthly salary of a policeman is less than 150,000 yuan, which is the most difficult problem for supervisors. In the past three months, the police bureau has listed detailed tables in the report on cracking theft and extortion cases. Not only were the cases that occurred in this city quickly solved; but also, many cases that occurred in other ports were solved locally. This situation is more progressive than in the previous concession period.</p>
<p>希望增加警察人數</p>
<p>Hope to Increase the Number of Police Officers</p>
<p>Shanghai currently has 16,160 police officers, and the budgeted number of police officers is 22,831. London has the most well-managed police administration in the world, with one police officer for about 500 residents. New York City in the United States has one police officer for every 200 residents. Shanghai currently has a total population of over 4 million. If social stability is required, according to the ratio of one police officer for every 200 residents in New York, more than 20,000 people are needed. A batch of police officers are trained every three months, so I hope that the city council can approve the budget to achieve the number of more than 20,000 police officers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>社會工作不易見功</p>
<p>Social Work Not Easy to See Results</p>
<p>Regarding society: The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for many affairs, which are easy to see faults but not easy to see achievements. Such as the mediation of labor-management disputes, the assessment of commodity prices, the promotion of labor welfare facilities, the promotion of full-scale work, the organization and training of various groups, the measurement of weights and measures, the establishment of relief institutions, the handling of winter relief, the relief of unemployed workers, agricultural extension, and the registration of farms. Labor unrest decreased slightly in July, August, and September, but has recently increased again, especially as the end of the lunar year approaches. It takes a lot of effort to mediate various labor unrest. Regarding the year-end bonus issue, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director Zhao of the Labor Department have made their best efforts to minimize labor unrest.</p>
<p>教職員增加千餘人</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Teachers and Staff Added</p>
<p>Regarding education: (1) Secondary education: Reorganizing and supporting private middle schools, improving teacher salaries and enriching school equipment, improving teacher qualifications, and reorganizing student status. (2) National education: Increasing schools, repairing school buildings, reorganizing and maintaining private elementary schools, promoting the counseling system, and promoting health education. (3) Social education: Actively eliminating illiteracy, promoting social education, carrying out social education activities, and adjusting social education institutions. (4) Supervision: Implementing district supervision, planning specialized supervision, holding symposiums, and handling emergencies. The Municipal Government increased education funding based on the resolution of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council, and the number of school classes also increased. Details can be found in the written report. The Municipal Government laid off more than 900 employees, but because the education budget increased, the number of schools increased, and the number of classes also increased, the number of teachers and staff increased by about 1,000. This is a special situation.</p>
<p>工務</p>
<p>Public Works</p>
<p>Regarding public works: In these three months, two things should be specially reported: One is the seawall project. As a result of active implementation, the Pudong area has been spared from flooding during the autumn and winter tides. The other is the flood control project. After actively dredging the ditches, to improve the traffic problem in the central district, after two months of research, it was gradually implemented, so there was significant progress in September and October of last year. However, the situation in the central district has recently returned to the state before September of last year. Improving traffic in the central district is indeed a major current issue. After detailed review, it is neither due to poor execution nor to bad methods. There are two major reasons: First, the number of vehicles (including motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles) has increased from more than 190,000 to more than 220,000.</p>
<p>取締攤販　由於妨礙</p>
<p>Banning Hawkers Due to Obstruction</p>
<p>Second, hawkers obstruct traffic. Banning hawkers is not for the purpose of improving the city appearance, but entirely for the traffic in the central district. If it is for the purpose of improving the city appearance, strict bans should be enforced throughout the city. The reason why it is only limited to the Huangpu and Old Bund districts is because the traffic in these two districts is too congested. Regarding this matter, the Municipal Government has specially drafted a proposal and sent it to the Municipal Council for detailed guidance. (5) Water transportation: Establishing the Municipal Ferry Company and opening up municipal ferry routes. (6) Wharf warehouses: Preparing to restore the Nanshi Wharf and preparing to establish the Nanshi Wharf Warehouse Company. (7) Warehouse telephone: Intensifying the installation of street lights and improving telephone facilities. (8) Others: Implementing the levy of additional donations for public utilities and adjusting the prices of public utilities.</p>
<p>地政方面</p>
<p>Land Administration</p>
<p>Regarding land administration: (1) Land registration is proceeding smoothly. Most of the land that had not been registered before has been registered with the Land Administration Bureau, ending the general land registration in the Huangpu and other main districts. Clearing foreign land rights and carrying out public land registration. (2) Levying land value tax, which is implemented in accordance with the resolution of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council. (3) Clearing land rights. (4) Clearing public land.</p>
<p>衛生</p>
<p>Hygiene</p>
<p>Regarding hygiene: (1) Improving cleaning and sanitation, enriching transportation tools, improving transportation methods, and strengthening management methods. (2) Improving epidemic prevention work. Cholera was prevalent last autumn, and the situation was extremely rampant. Based on the situation at that time, there was a deep fear that the epidemic would be more severe than in 1938. The Health Bureau mobilized all epidemic prevention personnel to work actively, and the results were remarkable. The epidemic was milder than in 1938, which was unexpected. Other measures such as preventing and controlling dysentery and typhoid fever, preventing diphtheria and meningitis, autumn and winter vaccinations, silkworm disinfection, mosquito reduction and malaria prevention, preventing and controlling rabies and venereal diseases, implementing fundamental epidemic prevention facilities, and storing epidemic prevention equipment are all being actively promoted. (3) Enriching medical equipment, expanding hospital beds, adjusting hospital distribution, opening suburban hospitals, adding clinics for the common people, adjusting hospital fees, and subsidizing emergency loans. (4) Expanding maternal and child health care, promoting safe childbirth, prenatal and postnatal care, expanding maternity bed facilities, adding infant care clinics, and piloting children's associations. (5) Strengthening school health. (6) Advocating health activities for children and youth. (7) Strictly managing medicine, banning medical advertisements, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, and conducting medical registration. (8) Reorganizing health management, removing accumulated coffins, organizing vegetable markets and inspecting meat products, organizing public cemeteries, and strengthening inspections.</p>
<p>財政方面</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Regarding finance: Dividing into income, expenditure, the reorganization of various taxes and donations, and the reorganization of public property and public debt. The Municipal Government's collection of donations and taxes is based on the principle of not disturbing the people. The Finance Bureau, in accordance with the resolutions of the Municipal Council, reorganizes tax revenue on the one hand and takes into account the burden on the citizens on the other, and there has never been any disturbance to the people.</p>
<p>檢討市政設施</p>
<p>Review of Municipal Facilities</p>
<p>Generally reviewing all municipal facilities in the past three months, they are inferior to the general situation in July, August, and September of last year. The salaries of public school teachers and staff are meager, and they have been able to work hard in difficult circumstances, which can be said to be the best effort they have made. What everyone is worried about at present is the economic crisis, which has four factors: one is high interest rates, the second is high wages, the third is the dumping of foreign goods, and the fourth is the destruction of transportation. He came to Shanghai in May of last year and publicly stated to the entire council of the labor community that the economic crisis would arrive in six months, which was unfortunately confirmed. The government has launched production loans to reduce high interest rates for the industrial and commercial sectors. Regarding the general wage issue, it is believed that the short-sighted approach of killing the chicken to get the eggs should not be adopted, and it is hoped that the labor community will find a way to no longer raise wages. Regarding the dumping of foreign goods, the government has implemented import controls. As for the destruction of transportation, it is a nationwide problem and cannot be done by one place. In addition to the four factors of the economic crisis mentioned above, the central government has decided to stabilize national commodity prices with all its strength this year. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and it is hoped that the representatives of public opinion organs will promote thrift and curb speculation; and it is hoped that the Municipal Council will organize a small committee in addition to the various committees to provide the Municipal Government with regular instructions on matters such as commodity prices, economy, and stabilizing social order.</p>
<p>市財政總預算已縮政策</p>
<p>The Municipal Financial Budget Has Been Reduced</p>
<p>As for the total municipal financial budget for the 36th year, at the beginning of the preparation, the expenses required by the Municipal Government and its various bureaus and offices were reduced from approximately 580 billion to 230.8 billion, intending to consider the needs of the citizens and at the same time take into account the burden on the citizens. The principle of preparing the total budget for the 36th year is to adopt a tight policy. Compared with the previous concession period and with cities such as Nanjing and Chongqing, the use of personnel and administration are not expanded. For example, there are currently more than 16,000 police officers, and it is planned to increase to more than 22,800 by October of this year. Another example is that the Education Bureau currently has 7,000 people (including teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools), and it is planned to increase to more than 9,000 this year. Furthermore, the Civil Affairs Office also needs to increase staff due to the handling of conscription. Because Shanghai is the model district designated by the central government for conscription, if each bao adds one bao team deputy and one assistant staff member, the number of staff in the Civil Affairs Office will increase from more than 2,000 to more than 4,000. Therefore, in the total budget, the total number of Municipal Government employees is listed as more than 50,000. In short, he has absolute confidence in the Municipal Council, and everything that is decided will be strictly implemented. In this year of arduous struggle in the 36th year, he hopes that the public opinion organs will provide instructions on the current economic crisis, and that the various councilors will regularly visit the various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government to conduct on-the-spot inspections and provide detailed guidance.</p>
<p>強佔校舍　迄未遷讓</p>
<p>Forcibly Occupied School Buildings Have Not Been Vacated</p>
<p>Councilor Feicheng Zhou also asked: If public and private schools are requisitioned by other agencies, what measures does the Municipal Government have to deal with them? The security team of the police bureau occupied the school building of the Municipal Shangwen Elementary School and has not yet moved out, but at the same time, it is handling the private Daren Middle School and Elementary School on the original site of the former French Concession police station on Jianguo West Road. What is the reason for this? If this precedent is set, there is a risk that a lot of publicly owned property will become private in the future. How should it be prevented? Councilor Jie Mei Pan said: The basic salary of the teachers of the municipal elementary schools in this city is too low, and life is very difficult. The Education Bureau had previously drafted a plan to increase the basic salary and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. The representatives of the municipal elementary school teachers and staff have also repeatedly requested a discretionary increase. Why has it not been approved so far? Councilor Liben Wang submitted a written inquiry: (1) The treatment of municipal school colleagues in this semester is still lower than that of private schools, causing panic among the teachers of municipal schools. What remedial measures does the Municipal Government have? (2) The cashiers of the municipal treasury are impolite to the municipal schools when withdrawing funds. Colleagues often endure in silence in order to save time. I wonder if the mayor can severely reprimand the authorities?</p>
<h3>Director Xuan's Resignation Intention Expected to be Dismissed [Report from this Newspaper] Police Chief Yi Tiewu submitted his resignation again a few days ago due to physical weakness. However, according to information obtained by reporters, after Mayor Wu's earnest retention, it is expected that the intention to resign will be dismissed.</h3>
<p>Shanghai Middle School Students Organize Anti-Riot Association Opposition to Actions Exceeding Scope</p>
<p>After the incident of the rape of a woman by a U.S. soldier in Beiping, students in this city were indignant and advocated that the government lodge a protest. The purpose of this matter has already been achieved by the students' protest this time. Middle school students in this city believe that some students' behaviors, such as strikes and parades, have exceeded the scope and expressed their opposition. They specially organized the "Shanghai Middle School Students Anti-Riot Association," posted slogans, expanded publicity, consoled beaten teachers and students, and issued declarations.</p>
<p>Flour Mill Manager's Car Robbed at the Qiujiang Road Intersection [Report from this Newspaper] Gao Bingtai, the manager of the Sanxin Flour Mill, owned a black-plated car with license number 10530, driven by Xu Jinhua. At about six o'clock the night before, when Xu was driving the car to the Tonghai Automobile Company on North Sichuan Road for storage, a strong man suddenly appeared with a gun and jumped into the car at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. Two more bandits jumped on the car midway. One bandit took over the driving. When they reached East Tiyu Hui Road, they drove Xu out of the car. As of midnight last night, the car had not been found. Afterwards, Xu Jinhua reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Station and requested investigation.</p>
<p>Strengthening Administrative Efficiency is Not About Numerous Personnel Demanding Streamlined Government, Clear Laws, and Reduced Taxes Expressing Dissent on Most of the Budget [Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, some senators expressed dissent on the large municipal government budget for the 1947 fiscal year. The mayor's report mentioned that police personnel must be increased to improve public security. Senator Fei Shusheng said: (1) I "oppose" the mayor's budget for police personnel based on the urban population and professional prosperity, using a geometric progression ratio. The ratio should be lower than an algebraic progression. (2) There is no need to increase the number of police and civil servants in this city. Having more people does not necessarily mean things will be done well. We should strengthen administrative efficiency. Therefore, we demand that the municipal government achieve "streamlined government, clear laws," and "reduced taxes and levies." He also asked the mayor what concrete plan he had for stabilizing Shanghai and requested a report on the implementation of the previous conference's resolutions. Senator Zhang Xingbai also advocated that increasing administrative efficiency does not depend on increasing manpower, but on improving technology. Senator Jia Dechao said: Mayor Wu hopes that we, the representatives of the people, will uphold justice and improve the good social atmosphere. Indeed, we also hope that Mayor Wu can truly protect justice and crack down on illegal activities. In addition, many citizens say that Mayor Wu's entertainment expenses are quite large. I wonder if they are included in the city budget and whether they can be further reduced. I would like to hear the details to dispel the doubts of five million citizens. Senator Jiang Hao asked: At the first conference, the municipal government officials all said they had a plan to "reduce personnel and streamline government." How much has been reduced now? At the same time, regarding the reduction of personnel from the puppet regime and the prior employment of meritorious resistance personnel, has this been done? According to his personal informal investigation, the municipal government is still retaining 1,500 personnel from the puppet regime. Can you tell me the exact number of people hired? Also, how can the crisis in the city's industry and commerce be saved?</p>
<p>More People Doesn't Necessarily Mean Things Get Done Well Bargaining is Unacceptable Senator Lu Shidao also said that having more people does not necessarily mean things can be done well. It seems like the mayor has included unused personnel in the budget first, which smacks of bargaining and is really "unacceptable." Also, the crisis in industry and commerce is so serious, and local taxes are already too heavy, and there are many central taxes, such as the profit tax. Can you request a reduction? Senator Ye Ganwen also expressed the same opinion. Senator Ye Fenghu believes that the estimation standards for housing donations and municipal construction losses are unbalanced with the actual housing donations. Please pay attention. Senator Li Wenjie, after reviewing the Finance Bureau's report, found that the actual expenditure in November and December of the second half of last year was less than the approved budget. He asked: As of the end of December, what is the amount of accounts payable and receivable on both the expenditure and revenue sides? How much surplus will there be in the 1946 fiscal year? Please ask the Director of Finance and the Comptroller to prepare and submit a written report in advance.</p>
<p>President Song's Plan in Shanghai to Restore Steel and Cotton Production President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, left his residence at 8:00 yesterday morning and went straight to the Bank of China Building to work. He left around 1:00 in the afternoon. Among the events handled that day, two were most important: (1) Actively seeking to restore the operation of steel factories across the country, with the initial production target of reaching pre-war output. (2) Planning to improve national cotton production to reduce imports of American cotton, with an estimated production of 12.5 million dan of national cotton this year.</p>
<p>Charity Dinner Dance Great Enthusiasm in Participation from All Sectors End of a Song, Dancing Begins Exciting Balloon Release Program [Report from this Newspaper] The Charity Dinner Dance of the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee was held yesterday, the first day, at the Yiyuan Hotel. From 5:00 p.m. onwards, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Ji, Mayor Wu, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Xianqing, and over 1,000 male and female guests arrived one after another. The traffic was heavy, causing congestion on the road. The venue was full of artistic slogans, with three large bunches of colorful balloons hanging in the middle, which were extremely bright and eye-catching. At 8:00 p.m., the venue was already packed. The General Secretary of the Committee, Wang Xianqing, first briefly described the meaning of the establishment of the Committee and the fundraising process in front of the music stand's loudspeaker. Then, Deputy Speaker Xu delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude to all the guests for their generous donations to benefit the refugees. Then the music began, and after the end of a song, the male and female guests began to dance. Before long, Mayor Wu arrived and briefly said a few words to the guests, expressing his deep gratitude. Other programs, such as releasing balloons and various dances, were performed successively. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 midnight. The committee temporarily sold more than 60 tickets yesterday. Movie stars, dance stars, and divas will continue to participate in the dance accompaniment in the next four nights. (The picture above shows Mayor Wu on the right and Deputy Speaker Xu on the left, taken by a reporter from this newspaper)</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Venue The venue was decorated with a Christmas tree more than a丈tall, placed in front of the ballroom. Santa Claus was still staying on the front wall of the dance floor, surrounded by a group of suffering people. Santa Claus pointed to the guests in the seats and said: Please, these kind men and women, give more help. Many elderly ladies and children at the venue only dined and did not dance. Speaker Pan arrived at the ballroom at 6:30 p.m., looked around for a week, and then left. Yang Hu and movie star Wang Xichun entered the venue together and sat in the guest seats. Soon, Fan Shaozeng and Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong also arrived one after another. Wang Xichun and Yang Xiuqiong sat side by side, and everyone's attention was immediately focused on them. Yang Xiuqiong wore a black velvet bare-armed evening dress. Wang Xichun did not take off her coat at first, giving people a feeling of winter and summer arriving at the same time. Xu Ji was busy greeting guests everywhere in the ballroom. He said that he had lived in Shanghai for 35 years, and yesterday was the first time he had entered a dance hall.</p>
<p>The Severity of the Housing Shortage Has Not Decreased Zhao Junhao Asks the Municipal Government to Announce the List of Housing Occupiers as Soon as Possible Following Mayor Wu's report on government work, Senator Gu Jingzhou was the first to raise questions. Regarding the improvement of traffic, he expressed his opinion, saying: In the past, the traffic order in the concessions was better. One reason was probably that the vehicle licenses in Nanshi and Zhabei were not unified, and vehicles could not be driven arbitrarily. The current traffic in the city is so congested. The solutions for improvement are: (1) Can a system of zoned driving licenses be implemented again? (2) Has the city overestimated the vehicle capacity of its streets, thus issuing more vehicle licenses? (3) In addition to cracking down on vendors and improving traffic, have the Public Security Bureau and the Second Police Bureau compared and studied the occupation of roads and the driving conditions of pedicabs and rickshaws? Senator Zhao Junhao said: The severity of the housing shortage has not decreased. At the last conference, the mayor expressed his determination to solve it and said: Some troops in this city are occupying civilian houses. As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of officials, only be afraid of those in charge." I can negotiate with the superiors and promised to announce the list of those who illegally occupy houses in mid-September, but there has been no news so far. I would like to ask three questions: (1) Has the unfinished business of the Housing Allocation Committee been transferred to the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government? What is the progress now? (2) Has the number of housing occupants been thoroughly investigated? How many are there? (3) If so, please announce the list immediately. Senator Tao Baichuan raised questions regarding the city's public property, for which the municipal government has not yet taken concrete measures or provided a detailed report: (1) How much public property does the municipal government have? What is its value? Has there been any sale? Was there any sale during the puppet regime? Has there been any sale after the establishment of the municipal government? (2) How is the existing public property used? (3) What was the process of transferring public land during the 工部局era? If a survey report is not available this time, can it be prepared for the next conference? Senator Zhang Xuelian asked: Regarding the return of farmland forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, the municipal government officials at the last conference said they would handle it earnestly, but why has there been no progress to date? Also, you promised to temporarily exempt the land value tax, why haven't you done so?</p>
<p>Mayor's Response to Questions Illegal Housing Occupations Have Been Enforced According to Law The Method of Zoned Driving for Vehicles Will be Considered The mayor declared that, except for some matters beyond the scope of his authority, he would give a comprehensive answer to the various questions as follows: (1) The method of zoned driving for vehicles will be considered and submitted to the conference. (2) The central government has sought fundamental solutions to the economic crisis, and the local government should assist. (3) The matter of public property is being handled by the Public Property Clearance Committee of the Executive Yuan, and it is under discussion. (4) The municipal government's personnel reduction has been implemented in accordance with regulations. The new additions are education personnel. (5) Teachers and staff of municipal schools are civil servants. If the salary is increased according to the proportion of private schools, then the police and others can also make requests. The municipal government's disapproval is really unavoidable and should be planned by the central supervisory authority. (6) The municipal government has submitted a request to the central government for interpretation and instructions regarding the puppet personnel retained by the municipal government. (7) This time, the matter of winter uniforms was not handled directly by the municipal government. I sympathize with the fact that the winning merchant failed to complete the work on schedule. (8) The principle of frugality is followed in the use of personnel. The profit tax has been requested from the central government. (9) Regarding the issue of personal entertainment expenses, there are many international etiquettes in Shanghai that cannot be avoided. We have tried our best to save money. If there is wasteful spending on personal entertainment expenses, please ask Senator Jia to investigate. (10) Regarding the removal of accumulated coffins, we only hope that it can be done this way. Otherwise, we will hold another municipal meeting to discuss it at that time, and there will be a flexible solution. (11) Whether the municipal government's revenue and expenditure have a surplus will be reported after consulting the Finance Bureau for the figures. (12) The central government's interpretation of horse racing has been published in the newspaper. (13) Regarding the illegal occupation of houses, the occupants or institutions have been dealt with according to law. (14) Improving the management of the municipal government will be accepted.</p>

<p>Four Groups Petition Outside Vendors in Xincheng District 2,000 People Shouting and Waving Flags Students Urge the Conference to Reconsider the Dismissal of Art Teachers and Students The Wine and Vegetable Industry Shouts Slogans to Support the New Tax Law [Report from this Newspaper] During the Second Conference of the First Municipal Senate yesterday, four groups petitioned the conference. The details of each situation are as follows: Students from the Municipal Art Normal School, dressed in Boy Scout uniforms, lined up in front of the venue early in the morning and distributed leaflets to the attendees, stating three reasons and urging the conference to reconsider the case of dismissing the Municipal Art Normal School. The named representatives of student parents were Ma Gongyu, Lang Jingshan, Pan Boying, Lü Baike, and He Tianjian, among others. When Mayor Wu was making his government report, about 300 people from the Wine and Vegetable Business Association and the Western Food and Coffee Business Association suddenly appeared in the audience seats on the second floor. They held large white cloth banners and small red and green paper flags and carried leaflets. Their slogans were: support the new banquet tax law, oppose the tiered collection of banquet tax, please the senators decide on a fair tax threshold, businesses with music equipment should not be subject to entertainment tax, we are reducing the burden for citizens, we are petitioning for our own survival, please the senators uphold justice. Senators Wang Xianqing and Liu Jingji represented the Senate in receiving the petitioners, claiming that they would leave it to the conference for discussion and would give a reasonable solution. When the conference adjourned, more than 2,000 petitioners from the outside vendors in the 11th district (Xincheng District) were in front of the Zhengshi Middle School, holding red and green paper flags and riding on four trucks to petition the conference. They claimed that they had been setting up stalls for more than ten years, and this time they were suddenly banned, and their livelihood was uncertain. Therefore, they requested the authorities to allow them to continue setting up stalls to maintain their livelihood. Senator Tang Shichang represented the Senate in receiving the petitioners and, after consultation with Yu Shuping, the acting police chief who attended the conference, promised to resolve the matter properly.</p>
<p>Small Scenes at the Conference Mayor's Apt Metaphor Speaker Wears a Coat The first senator to sign in yesterday was Huang Zhenshi, who was recently formally prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for allegedly being a traitor. The lighting equipment in the venue was very thorough. In addition to a row of lights in front of the stage and several large lights hanging on top, there were four exposure lights on each side of the walls, and four large mercury lamps on the second floor, illuminating the stage, much like a theatrical stage. Du Yuesheng, a senator who did not attend the last conference, also rushed to the meeting yesterday. His seat was number 151, in the third row from the back. Zhu Fuzhen and Shi Bangfan sat side by side at the previous conference, and it happened that they drew side by side again this time, believing that "they were destined in a previous life." Senator Zhu said that he sat to his left last time and to his right this time. Someone said he was "the left and right prime minister." Yesterday was overcast and rainy. Although there were four stoves in the venue, the place was too large, and it was still cold and damp. Senators Li Wenjie and Chen Baotai saw that Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang did not wear coats and were sitting on the stage, and they sympathized very much. They specially sent a proposal paper, which read: "It's too cold, the Speaker and Secretary-General should put on coats." Half an hour later, the Speaker did put on a leather-collared coat. Mayor Wu said during his report: On the one hand, we must take care of the needs of life, and on the other hand, we must take care of the burden of the people. The municipal government and the Municipal Senate are like a sandwich,夹in the middle. After the government report, when the emcee announced the start of the questioning of the municipal government, the atmosphere on the seats of the municipal government attendees suddenly became very tense. The mayor and the heads of various bureaus secretly discussed countermeasures. At the last conference, Mayor Wu's ashtray was always full of cigarette butts. Yesterday, it was suddenly seen that the mayor had changed his style and started smoking a pipe. However, the habit of nodding frequently when listening to the senators' questions remained the same. Senator Shao Yongsheng, No. 149, personally went to the rostrum to submit written questions. When speaking, he gritted his teeth, clenched his fists, and was overly excited, so that his speech exceeded the time limit and was warned as many as nine times. Afterwards, the rostrum was afraid that the bell was too small to be heard clearly, so they added two more bells. In this way, when the speaker exceeded the time, several bells rang together, and the momentum was greatly enhanced. The questioning ended at 12:25 p.m. Mayor Wu took the stage to answer one by one. After answering quickly, the senators, eager to go home for dinner, did not pursue the matter further and dispersed in a rush, giving the mayor a break.</p>

<p>The Wolf of Changshu Executed Ugly Appearance Revealed After Hearing the Verdict Trembling All Over, Legs Weak, Face Pale Awaiting Approval by the Ministry, Execution Scheduled [Report from this Newspaper] Mi Cun Chunxi, formerly the captain of the Changshu enemy gendarmerie, nicknamed "The Wolf of Changshu," created many unjust prisons and killed innocent people during the war. After the victory, he was arrested and sent to the First Pacification District Military Court for trial. He was sentenced to death yesterday afternoon. The main text of the verdict is as follows: "Mi Cun Chunxi violated the laws of war, committed planned murder, sentenced to death; condoned subordinates to continuously torture non-military personnel to death and treat the people inhumanely, sentenced to death. Should be executed." When Judge Li Liang read the verdict and explained the reasons, Mi Cun trembled all over, and his legs softened, as if he was about to fall. Two court officers stepped forward to help him. However, by the time he was escorted back to prison, he had returned to normal. He bowed to the judge, the defense lawyer, and the audience, but the ruddy color of his face had turned pale. The date of Mi Cun's execution will be decided after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. According to the law, no appeal is allowed for this death sentence. However, Judge Li finally declared: "If the defendant has any statement to make, he may submit a statement of defense within ten days after the verdict is served, and the military court will forward it to the Ministry of National Defense for review."</p>

<p>Old Jew Collaborates with the Enemy The Court Orders Investigation and Retrial [Report from this Newspaper] Robert Peritz, 51 years old, is a stateless Jew. He was accused of colluding with the Japanese enemy. He was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and most of the audience were Jews. The defendant was burly, with gray hair, wearing a black suit. Standing in the defendant's column, he often showed impatience. He was accused of running for the enemy in 1940 when the enemy tried to control the administrative power of the Shanghai 工部局, fearing that the number of overseas Chinese votes was insufficient. He wooed German Jewish refugees to join the voting. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1942, the enemy stationed in the concession. The defendant was commissioned by the enemy navy to set up an organization at the Cathay Hotel. Under the command of the enemy, he secretly reviewed documents related to Britain and broadcast in German every day to publicize for the enemy. At the same time, he vigorously supported the pro-Japanese Shanghai Jewish newspaper and prevented the publication of other Jewish newspapers that were beneficial to our country. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been detained in a concentration camp by the enemy gendarmerie for five weeks. He claimed that the original informant, Stingle Hawthorne, sold black market goods in the concentration camp and was a public enemy of Jewish refugees. Then, an English Jewish Anming Staier came to court to testify. The court ordered that the investigation was still needed and rescheduled the retrial.</p>

<p>Soviet Enemy Gendarmerie Henchman Denies Extortion [Report from this Newspaper] Soviet citizen Paul D. Sifford, accused of working for the enemy gendarmerie, was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendant had sparse yellow hair on his head and wore a black leather coat and beige suit pants. He confessed that he had served as a secret agent of the Harbin enemy gendarmerie. After coming to Shanghai, he worked in the criminal section of the enemy gendarmerie on Broadway Road. He denied extorting huge sums of money from merchants by relying on the enemy's power. Then, a witness from Russia, A. Baba Mar索夫(a diamond merchant), testified that the defendant had used the excuse of buying diamonds from British and American侨民 and led the enemy gendarmerie to blackmail him.

<p>Bao Qihuang Ordered to Shanghai to Continue Interrogating Wang Renshan Since the Jiangwan Armory Explosion, after the head of the sub-warehouse, Wang Renshan, turned himself in, Bao Qihuang, the chief military judge of the Ministry of National Defense, was ordered to come to Shanghai again the day before yesterday to handle the continued interrogation of the case. It is learned that yesterday afternoon, Director Bao, together with Yan Zi, the deputy director of the Hudong Inspection Office of the Garrison Command, transferred the Wang Renshan case to the Military Court of the Garrison Command for interrogation. The interrogation lasted until 4:30 in the afternoon. Wang Renshan was still escorted back to the detention center of the First Supply Command. According to Director Bao, after the interrogation, he told reporters that Qin Decun, the president of the trial court in this case, was unable to come to Shanghai due to official duties. He was ordered to come to Shanghai to conduct the trial of this case. Today, he and Deputy Director Yan of the Inspection Office have conducted an interrogation. Tomorrow (that is, today), the trial judge, Hui Zhaoyi, Tao Yishan, military judge Xu Shigao, and he will jointly interrogate the case. After the interrogation, the interrogation situation will be reported to President Qin for review, and then submitted to the highest authority for a final decision. Regarding whether Wang Renshan's voluntary surrender can be commuted according to law, Director Bao said that Wang Renshan's return to the department this time was to surrender himself, not because he was caught. According to legal procedures, anyone who voluntarily surrenders after the occurrence of this case and before it is discovered is called Bai首(surrender). Now the case has come to an end, and Wang's return to the department is actually a surrender. Whether or not the sentence can be commuted will be decided by the trial judges in this case based on the actual situation after the joint trial.</p>
<p>More Than 2,000 Tons of Iron Estimated Value Exceeds 1 Billion Embezzled from Within Sun Zhuting Files a Secret Report in His Own Name Requests Investigation of Relevant Receivers [Report from this Newspaper] The investigation of the case of the Fuji Construction Factory hiding enemy assets has not yet ended. Unexpectedly, the District Procuratorate recently received a secret report signed by Sun Zhuting and co-signed by Cao Haishen and Zhu Shengyao, requesting the investigation of Lv Shishang, the former leader of the Investigation Team of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau and the person in charge of the Third Front Army Military Goods Receiving Committee, and Ding Guitang, the former deputy general tax officer of the Customs and former tax officer of the Jianghai Customs. The content roughly stated: On September 29, 1945, the secret report to the Military Goods Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army seized a large number of enemy assets hidden in No. 340 Deng脫Road, including coal, iron, oil, rice, wheat, etc. Among them, there were more than 2,100 tons of scrap iron and more than 26,000 strips of pig iron (i.e., white iron water pipes). The above-mentioned materials were transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau after the establishment of the Bureau on December 11 of the same year, and the Bureau handed them over to Jianghai Customs for receipt. The two items of scrap iron and pig iron were publicly auctioned by Jianghai Customs on December 23, entrusted to Da Zhong, Yi Zhong, Rui He, and Louis Mo 洋行. However, the Military Goods Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army did not transfer the original report file to the Processing Bureau, so the secret report bonus for this batch of materials has not yet been approved. After the original informants repeatedly urged Jianghai Customs, they recently replied that there were not more than 2,000 tons of scrap iron, only 900 tons, and only 400 tons were actually sold. There were still 250 tons of residual iron皮(iron皮). As for the number of 2,100 tons of scrap iron and 26,000 strips of pig iron at that time, some said "typo," some said "estimation error," and some said "the auction on December 23 was not the materials from Deng脫Road." However, Sun Zhuting and others have been able to confirm from various sources that the more than 2,000 tons of scrap iron and pig iron have been embezzled, and their estimated value should be more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, they submitted a document requesting an investigation into Lv Shishang, Ding Guitang, and the personnel who handled the receipt and auction, so that the truth would be revealed. Because the case is related to the case of the Fuji Construction Factory hiding enemy assets, it is still being handled by Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao. However, what Prosecutor Gu had previously investigated was only the enemy quality hidden in the warehouse on Yanping Road. This time, Deng脫Road is another case. Prosecutor Gu specially presented a reply first and then filed the case separately. The detention period of Shen Wenyuan, an important suspect in the previous case, was about to expire, so he should be prosecuted. Now, because of another school section, Prosecutor Gu has applied to the court to extend Shen's detention period to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<p>Central Cooperative Bank Shanghai Branch Opens The Shanghai Branch of the Central Cooperative Bank opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, presided over by General Manager Shou Miancheng. He gathered all the branch colleagues at 7:00 a.m. and gave a speech, encouraging them with the spirit of cooperation for the future development of the cooperative cause and mentioning the difficulties in establishing the Central Cooperative Bank and the Bank's business philosophy, with many warnings. The branch is divided into five groups: General Affairs, Business, Accounting, Treasury, and Guidance, providing financial guidance and assistance for various cooperative businesses in the area. The Central Cooperative Bank's main task is to restore and develop the cooperative economy in the pacification zone. However, Shanghai is the financial and economic center of the country, and its impact on the inland economy is profound and huge. All aspects, such as the transportation and sales of agricultural products, the supply of agricultural supplies, and the flow of urban capital to rural areas to support agriculture, must be closely linked with the city in order to be effective. The establishment of the Shanghai Branch is extremely important for the development of the Bank's cause.</p>

<p>Suspects in Vendor Case First Trial Yesterday All Allowed to Post Bail A Chorus of Thank You [Report from this Newspaper] Last year, when this newspaper selected the top ten news stories, the vendor incident was selected as the number one news story. The suspects detained in the case were Fang Daosheng, Liu Ouxiang, Lu Genlin, Lin Ajiang, Chen Abao, Xia Caigen, Ye Genfu, Si Huazhang, Qi Jiagu, Wu Changkang, Zhao Fuqing, Yu Quhua, Ni Shunxiang, Li Jinyuan, Wu Datou, Liu Cheng铮, Wang Yinyin, Xu Yuntao, Gu Lidao, Li Changgui, Zhang Rongqin, Gu Ermao, Liu Haiquan, Kang Zuyuan, Zhou Meilin, Qian Niulang, Ju Qiguang, Wu Hesheng, Ma Shulu, Yin Agen, Zhuang Gongmin, Zhang Xinfu, Sun Rongliang, Tang Youhua, Zhang Miaogen, Yan Yunbao, Chen Linsheng, Zu Shizi, Dong Xin竟, Sun Yuanchang, Zhou Mingde, Liu Xingfa, Han Akun, Zhang Amao, Ni Defu, and Wang Qichang. The 46 people were prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for obstructing public order. At 10:20 yesterday morning, the District Court held its first public trial. Of the 46 defendants, 20 were in custody and 26 were out on bail. All the defendants except one were present in court, and Shi Enjian, the director of the Lao閘 Police Branch, and Jiang Shangpei, the judicial section chief, were called as witnesses.</p>
<p>Amnesty Order Not Received · Trial Proceeded as Usual Judge Xie Zhiying first called the names of the 45 defendants and inquired about their ages and native places. Then the 검察官announced: The defendants' crimes have been seen in the indictment. However, now the National Government has issued an amnesty order, and all the defendants' crimes are within the scope of the amnesty. The defendants have requested bail, and the court is requested to grant bail in accordance with the law. After the Prosecutor's announcement, Judge Xie summoned Director Shi of the branch to state the process of arresting the defendants. Before the trial, Judge Xie told the defendants in a very gentle manner: The City Government's crackdown on the拟版has to do with 生计, but 等等 should request relief through proper procedures. Gathering crowds to riot and obstruct order is not permitted by law. Although the amnesty order has been posted, this court will proceed with the trial as usual before the order is received. It is hoped that all will confess the facts truthfully to avoid further summons and questioning. He also announced: The defendants who have previously been released on bail can remain on their original bail, and those in custody will also be allowed to post bail and be available at any time. It is hoped that they will understand this intention, repent, and start anew.</p>
<p>Formal Vendors Only One Third After the announcement, individual trials began. The defendants all denied the crimes of destroying shops, inciting strikes, obstructing vehicles, and spreading rumors. The defendants were not all vendors. For example, the first defendant, Fang Zhesheng, confessed that he was a blacksmith, the second defendant, Liu Zhiqing, confessed that he was a handyman, the third defendant, Lu Genlin, confessed that he was a printing worker, and the fourth defendant, Lin Ajiang, confessed that he was a shoe shiner. Formal vendors accounted for less than one-third of the total. The trial continued until noon, and all 45 people had been questioned. Judge Xie announced that all were allowed to post bail. A chorus of thank you was heard in the courtroom, and everyone left happily. However, among them, Ye Gengshi, who was only 17 years old, had lost both parents, and no one could find bail for him. He was the only one who was not released.</p>

<p>Hong Kong in the Cold Season</p>
<p>December 28th, Hong Kong Shipping News</p>
<p>Following the departure of the British Trade Mission to China, well-informed sources in Hong Kong and China once widely speculated that President Song would soon come to Shanghai for inspection. Now, the facts have proven that the high-ranking financial officials from our side coming to Hong Kong are not President Song, but rather the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, along with the British financial advisor, Mr. Rogers, and other economic experts.</p>
<p>Bei Zuyi's Mysterious Mission to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mr. Bei's mission to Hong Kong has now sparked various speculations. Some say it is related to the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations, while others say it concerns the adjustment of the national currency exchange rate. Opinions vary, and no consensus has been reached. When Mr. Bei met with reporters, he only said that he was coming to Hong Kong for the Christmas holidays and had no other missions. Mr. Bei's vacation to Hong Kong is accompanied by as many as fifteen financial experts or important officials, which is no wonder the speculation from various quarters is intensifying. According to economic authorities, Mr. Bei's main tasks on this trip, in addition to inspecting the Central Bank's operations and rectifying the financial situation, are: (1) to promote export trade, (2) to prevent smuggling, and (3) to strengthen the management of overseas remittances.</p>
<p>Mr. Bei arrived in Hong Kong after 2:00 PM on the 21st. That evening, Hong Kong Governor Young hosted a dinner at Government House to welcome Mr. Bei. It is rumored that Mr. Bei will meet with the General Manager of HSBC, Mr. Morse, on the 23rd. The four major banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) are scheduled to hold a grand cocktail party for Mr. Bei at the Gloucester Hotel on the 9th floor at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, to entertain the heads of local Chinese and other foreign banks, leaders of the business community, senior Hong Kong government officials, etc. Mr. Bei will stay in Hong Kong for a week.</p>
<p>Capital Flight to Hong Kong Continues to Increase Monthly</p>
<p>Capital flight from the mainland to Hong Kong has continued to increase in recent months. In the initial stage, the amount of capital fleeing to Hong Kong each month was estimated at 10 billion national currency, but recently it has increased to 30 billion national currency. The total amount of capital flight to Hong Kong in the second half of this year is estimated to be over 100 billion national currency. As the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei will naturally not ignore this serious problem. However, to thoroughly stop capital flight from the mainland to Hong Kong, it is necessary to obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. Mr. Bei's long journey here is likely one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Our country's financial authorities often focus on Shanghai as the axis, while neglecting the special characteristics of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's economy shares the same origin as the mainland, but its direct control lies with the London government. Capital from the mainland can be converted into foreign exchange in Hong Kong. The mainland restricts the import of foreign goods, and Hong Kong becomes a smuggling center. The mainland bans the export of yarn, and the mainland controls foreign exchange, so overseas remittances are transferred to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong procures Japanese yarn for the market... Because of the existence of this kind of backlash, the longer the time, the greater the impact, and we have to urgently find remedies.</p>
<p>The Head of the Trade Mission Claims Japanese Yarn Will Be Shipped to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Sir Bowes, the head of the British Trade Mission to China, gave a speech to Hong Kong merchants, stating that Britain is determined to make its best efforts to supply Hong Kong and Chinese factories with industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>He claimed that as a result of the Hong Kong government taking over from the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo, a Japanese ship has already loaded 2 million pounds of Japanese yarn and set sail from Japan to Hong Kong, which is expected to arrive at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The more than 500 large and small weaving factories in Hong Kong require approximately 640,000 pounds of cotton yarn per month, so the first batch of Japanese yarn can supply three months' worth. The Hong Kong government has assured the weavers that it will continue to supply cotton yarn for at least six months. The cost of each bale of Japanese yarn is valued at 800,000 national currency, while Shanghai yarn is currently valued at over 2 million national currency. It is easy to imagine what impact that will have on the future of Shanghai yarn. Currently, the price of printed cotton cloth in Hong Kong and China has plummeted, selling for only 1.5 to 2.5 national currency per yard. After the arrival of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong, it will inevitably become even cheaper. At that time, the domestic market will be flooded with Hong Kong cotton products woven from Japanese yarn!</p>
<p>Looking to the Future, Hong Kong Merchants are Mostly Optimistic</p>
<p>Hong Kong business leaders are mostly optimistic about the prospects for 1947. According to their analysis, there are approximately the following points:</p>
<p>Ferry Carrying Cars Between Hong Kong and Kowloon</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent for this newspaper in Hong Kong, Zi Jian, took this photo)</p>
<p>(1) Because Hong Kong was occupied for several years, the source of foreign goods was interrupted, so after the victory, the first imported goods were snapped up and received unexpectedly large interest rates, but this is an abnormal state and cannot last.</p>
<p>(2) Some merchants thought they could make huge profits, so they rushed to place large orders, creating an imbalance between supply and demand, causing prices to fall daily.</p>
<p>(3) Because the transport ships after the war came and went irregularly, and labor strikes occurred frequently, the supply was intermittent, sometimes arriving in large quantities, and sometimes not arriving for a long time, making it impossible for importers and exporters to budget, and profits and losses were uncertain.</p>
<p>(4) This situation is an abnormal state after the war. In the future, prices will gradually tend to a reasonable level, and ship traffic will become more normal. Although merchants will not get windfall profits as in the past, business may have a budget and a certain interest rate. Business will be able to achieve soundness, and the future can naturally be optimistic.</p>
<p>(5) Although the mainland implements very strict import controls, its purpose is to prevent people's expenditures from increasing gradually, which is a countermeasure to stabilize the domestic financial economy. However, there are still many essential goods in the mainland that must rely on foreign imports...</p>
<p>However, pessimists also have their reasons: they cite the recent three months of Hong Kong import and export figures to prove that Hong Kong's trade has gradually declined:</p>
<p>In these three months, imports have decreased by 30 million yuan, and exports have decreased by 14 million yuan, making business in all industries increasingly dull.</p>
<p>Spring Lottery Tickets: Latecomers Miss Out</p>
<p>The market is as quiet as usual, and merchants can only pin their hopes on the future. The Hong Kong government's financial budget is also calling for economic downturn. After the Legislative Council passed the collection of food and beverage tax (one-tenth), increased tobacco and alcohol tax, and collected property sales tax, it was rumored that it was considering collecting dance tax. Therefore, not only merchants are eager for early prosperity, but the government is also eagerly hoping for early prosperity!</p>
<p>In the past few days, contrary to the general business firms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club's lottery ticket sales office has been exceptionally crowded. More than 300,000 tickets for the spring lottery, which is scheduled to be drawn on January 14th next year, have already been sold. Latecomers will miss out. Who doesn't want to be the winner in 1947! After this year, Hong Kong's reconstruction work has been mostly completed. The magnificent Peninsula Hotel, the cars in front of the door are again lined up, restoring the scene of the year. The ferry carrying cars has long been traveling between Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the ugly souvenir of the Japanese army, the "Loyal Souls Pagoda," has now been put out for tender for demolition. The two large bronze lions in front of the HSBC bank have also been shipped back from Japan to their original stone base. The external wounds of Hong Kong seem to have been largely washed away. Now, general attention is focused on how to get through its recession and turn to the road to prosperity.

<p>Scenery of Fuzhou, an Eastern Garden City</p>
<p>December 28th, Flight News</p>
<p>Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>The reporter flew from Shanghai to Fuzhou on the eve of Christmas. When the plane arrived at Fuzhou Airport, the aircraft wheel malfunctioned, almost causing a major disaster. It finally landed dangerously after circling several times in the air, suffering only a severe shock, fortunately without any accidents. The plane landed at Yiyu Airport, located in the suburbs of Fuzhou, more than ten miles from the urban area. Driving into the city on the rugged road, the reporter, having been away from his hometown for seven years of war, was not without emotion as he saw the elders and brothers of Minzhong (Fuzhou).</p>
<p>Social Economy</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Fuzhou fell twice, once in the 30th year and once in the 33rd year of the Republic [1941 and 1944]. Although the enemy's occupation time was very short, materials were plundered. In the 30th year, after the enemy withdrew from Fuzhou, the Taiwanese enemy radio broadcast that the enemy had not destroyed Fuzhou and withdrew voluntarily. In fact, the buildings in the Fuzhou urban area did not suffer any destruction. However, after the enemy left, Fuzhou suffered an unprecedented food panic, and starvation was everywhere. Fuzhou people still remember it vividly. Fuzhou was originally unable to supply its own food and relied on the assistance of northern Fujian and Nanyang (Southeast Asia) rice. In terms of industry, there was only the manufacture of handicrafts. Many daily necessities relied on imports from Shanghai. How could it withstand two sieges by the enemy and puppet regimes? Therefore, the current situation of material exhaustion has been formed.</p>
<p>After the provincial government returned to Fuzhou last November, the population of Fuzhou increased sharply, followed by soaring prices. Post-war coastal shipping has not yet returned to its pre-war state. Fuzhou's export trade is also somewhat restricted by transportation. Moreover, in today's dumping of foreign goods, the entire national industry is suffocated, and the trade deficit is becoming increasingly serious. How can this be limited to Fuzhou's export trade? Fuzhou's handicrafts, such as lacquerware, have always been famous at home and abroad and have won awards at the Chicago Exposition in the United States. Now, sales are also feeling difficult. Fuzhou does not have a stock exchange market, and there is no frenzied speculation by big capitalists. The price of gold and US dollars in Fuzhou does not lead the prices. Therefore, it is very clear that the rise in prices is entirely dominated by the law of supply and demand, and the situation is relatively simple compared to Shanghai. As soon as prices rise, the first to bear the brunt are public school teachers and staff with a fixed amount of currency income. Fuzhou is listed in the fourth grade according to the central salary standard (recently adjusted to the third grade). A-level public school teachers and staff only receive a salary of over 100,000 yuan. How can they support themselves and their families in the face of white rice at 80,000 yuan per dan?</p>
<p>When the reporter met with friends, they all bitterly talked about the pain of high prices and the oppression of life. However, the reporter, who had just arrived from Shanghai, felt a sense of relief. In any case, the price index of all goods (excluding foreign goods) is lower than that of Shanghai, and the cost of living is slightly higher than that of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Political Situation</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about conscription: the general public in Fuzhou habitually do not say "conscription" but say "pulling strong men," which shows the psychology of the public. It is said that the Fuzhou Municipal Government has not yet formally issued an order to conscript strong men, but the district offices and even the Baojia heads have already started "forcibly pulling strong men," and even blood cases have been caused. Strong men were injured before they even went on an expedition, which became a topic of street gossip for the citizens of Fuzhou. The Fuzhou media has strongly criticized the authorities for this. It is heard that the district head of Daqiao District, where the blood case occurred, has been dismissed from his post for investigation, and the two injured strong men have been sent to public hospitals for treatment. The occurrence of this kind of incident is truly unfortunate and is enough to create difficulties for the conscription work. In addition, cases of impersonation are emerging one after another. The price of a strong man has broken through the one million yuan mark and can be compared with the status of a strong man in Guangzhou. It is heard that the Baojia heads also illegally apportioned resettlement expenses for the strong men to each household, and the amount was determined by the Baojia heads at their discretion to be given to the families of volunteers. It is heard that the municipal government authorities are paying attention to this matter. The policy of conscription has a very short history of implementation in our country, but malpractices are emerging one after another. When the public hears about conscription, they are all uneasy. The reason is nothing more than that the personnel handling military service have failed to fulfill their duties. They neither handle it in accordance with the "three equal principles" of military service nor can they provide the strong men who are conscripted into the camp with a comfortable life and treat their families well so that they have no worries. How can they blame the strong men for deserting?</p>
<p>Prostitution and dancing are still prohibited in Fuzhou under the current laws, but underground activities are rampant. Not long ago, the municipal government had a proposal to lift the ban, but it was rejected by the women's movement. However, relevant parties said that if prostitution and dancing are completely prohibited, the livelihoods of a large number of prostitutes and singers will be difficult to maintain, which will create social unrest. Moreover, the secret exploitation suffered by these people is even more serious. Rather than doing underground business, it is better to let them operate openly, and the municipal government can also obtain funds from dancers and patrons in the municipal financial autonomy, which is in dire straits—why not develop a reliable source of taxation? The reporter told a friend: In order to rectify the declining morals, it is not impossible for the government to ban prostitution and dancing. However, after the ban, where can she get food? The government does not have many production institutions for them to do direct production. Therefore, they still secretly engage in their old occupations.</p>
<p>"Severely punish corruption and rectify official norms." This is a unanimous requirement from all over the country. However, in the midst of shouting to report corruption, the corrupt officials still do their own thing. What does it have to do with you? Not long ago, Fuzhou had a grain corruption case that used power for personal gain. Gao Dengting, the director of civil affairs, and relevant officials stepped down, which was considered settled. Recently, two more corruption cases have occurred, which the Fuzhou media has exposed. One is the suspicion of corruption and dereliction of duty by Xu Yuanpei, the director of the Education Section of the Municipal Government. The matter originated from the fact that he accepted gifts from his subordinates for his father's funeral, which seemed to exceed the limits of friendship. It is said that the supervisory agency has sent personnel to investigate thoroughly. The other is the large-scale corruption case by the group headed by Yang Donglin, the director of the tax collection office of the municipal government. There are 6 million yuan without supporting evidence. There are still more than 10 million yuan in the investigation. The entire case has been thoroughly investigated by personnel sent by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Scenery</p>
<p>Approximately 400,000 people are concentrated in Fuzhou, this "Eastern Garden City." Fuzhou has a strong literary style, and children regard studying as the supreme honor. Education is also developed, with three colleges and numerous middle schools, and many are large in scale. On the way, you can see students in uniforms walking quickly to school in groups of three or five. The church has a great influence in Fuzhou. The more large-scale schools in Fuzhou are all church schools, such as the Union University, Yinghua, Gezhi, and Trinity Middle Schools, which have nurtured many talents. Fuzhou has six daily newspapers and three weekly newspapers. The magazines published by the Improvement Publishing House and the Provincial Research Institute are better. In general, secondary education in Fuzhou is very developed, and higher education needs to be expanded because many Fuzhou children go north or to Shanghai for further study after graduating from middle school. Culture is declining, and the literary world is poor. This may be because the life of literati is difficult and the publishing industry cannot rise due to high prices.</p>
<p>Fuzhou has beautiful scenery and pleasant scenery. The Min River runs through the front, surrounded by mountains on three sides, preserving a pure ancient style. The people of Fuzhou pass down bronze and stone calligraphy and paintings from generation to generation and regard them as treasures. Confucian classics and historical records are used as family textbooks. The Fuzhou dialect forms its own system. When outsiders first arrive in Fuzhou, the most uncomfortable thing is the language barrier. According to legend, the Fuzhou dialect is the earliest language in our country. Before the Song Dynasty, it was used in various parts of Jiangnan (the area south of the Yangtze River). Later, other branches of our Han nationality, Hokkien, and other ethnic groups occupied Fuzhou from the sea and infiltrated their languages into the Fuzhou language, forming the Fuzhou dialect today. This can be verified in historical records.</p>
<p>Fuzhou is located on the coast. Going out of the Min River estuary is the East China Sea. The waterway traffic can reach Shanghai in two and a half days to the north and Xiamen in one day to the south. The land route has the Fuxia Line, which can reach Xiamen in one day. This line was destroyed during the war and is now being repaired in stages. The export of wood, tea, shiitake mushrooms, fruits, paper, and bamboo shoots from northwestern Fujian and the import of Shanghai foreign goods all take Fuzhou as a port of entry and exit. The South Tai Surface in Fuzhou faces the Min River and is a trading center, just like the Bund in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Happy Valley Racecourse After the War, Golden Ounce is Intact (Special Reporter Zi Jian)</p>
<p>Taiwan East Travelogue (4) Hualien Port</p>
<p>Taipei News on the 23rd</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Hualien Port - the first city in eastern Taiwan, a new emerging port city. Eastern Taiwan generally includes Taitung, Hualien Port, Suao, and Yilan. Taitung and Hualien Port are two counties. Suao, Luodong, and Yilan now belong to Taipei County. Local people in the northeastern part of the island are now brewing a restoration: restoring the county administration. In terms of Taitung and Hualien Port, Hualien Port is actually more prosperous and lively than Taitung. Taitung is a desolate city submerged in the desert. There is no one on the streets at dusk, and the torches for the lights emit a dim light. The sea breeze blows sand during the day, full of dust; Hualien Port looks like it is wearing the coat of a modern civilized city. Although the low houses retain the charm of 30 years ago, the prosperity of the port makes it directly bear the impact of the torrents from inside and outside the island. It is still young!</p>
<p>The local people will compare the desolate scene of 30 years ago (then named Zhuyang) with the present. At that time, it was a desolate hill on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, a sparse village of twenty or thirty households; 30 years later, it has the prototype of a city and is indeed the first city in eastern Taiwan. Hualien Port people can be proud of this.</p>
<p>Great Mountain Range</p>
<p>Reserves of Mountain Forest Minerals</p>
<p>County Magistrate Zhang Wencheng and the county's Inspectorate arranged a schedule and comfortable accommodation. There are more hostels in Hualien Port than in Taitung, and they still maintain a pure Japanese style, providing accommodation for passing travelers. When the Changgui VIP gasoline car drove into the station, we heard firecrackers, and a line of welcoming representatives lined up in the night streets to greet us. Among us, we all felt uneasy, really feeling like when Wilkie received a grand welcome in Chongqing.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Zhang said that because the telecommunications were not smooth, preparations were made as early as two days ago, so they were able to receive the news today. He told us in detail about the current situation of Hualien Port. He said that the biggest blow to the port was the bombing in the 33rd year [1944]. It is rich in placer gold, with a 50-foot deep gold-bearing layer underground, with mercury, asbestos, limestone, marble, without having to look for the coal mines in the west, with more than 80% of the forest area, inexhaustible lumber, and a sugar factory that is being rebuilt.</p>
<p>The county government, like Taitung, requires provincial assistance for 4/10 of the budget for the 36th year [1947], which is a reduction of 19 million compared to this year. The county magistrate hopes to cooperate with other departments to build farmland irrigation and water conservancy, and build transportation. He hopes that any business that the county can do will be handed over to the county to do, and any business that the county does not have the power to do will be done by the province.</p>
<p>There are 32 mountains with a height of several thousand feet behind the port, including Nanhu Mountain, Central Jianshan Mountain, North Hehuan Mountain, Zhilai Mountain, Nenggao Mountain, Andongjun Mountain, Yuanda Mountain, Xiuguluan Mountain, etc. The whole county has 140,000 people, and more than 50,000 Gaoshan people are scattered in the plains and mountains. These Gaoshan people scattered in the mountains like to burn mountains with wildfires, and the forests suffer, so Director Chen specially appointed the director with a hand-written order to strictly prohibit it. The county magistrate and we have the same view that eastern Taiwan is not an agricultural or commercial area but an industrial area with natural conditions.</p>
<p>Port of Call: Ports Need Urgent Repairs</p>
<p>The Japanese boasted that Hualien Port, located in the Milun Plain, was an unparalleled excavated port in the world. Before the construction of the Suhua Highway, the annual import and export cargo reached more than 80,000 tons. As a result, the Japanese government allocated 7.5 million in 1931 to start construction and completed it in October 1939. Later, the railway from Taitung to Hualien was also extended northward from Hualien City to the port, completing sea-land transportation, with annual import and export cargo reaching 200,000 tons. In 1940, it was decided to expand the port with a budget of 5 million. In 1945, it was affected by the war and fell into a standstill. This port is a small port completely artificially excavated, with a depth of 15 meters. The east and west breakwaters surround the outer port, and the inner port is rectangular, with a berthing area of 70,000 square meters. The water surface flow rate is 2,300 meters per hour. Because it has not been repaired for many years, it was originally used as a port of call and could berth ships of 3,000 tons. Now the Hualien Branch of the Keelung Port Bureau is planning to deepen the water depth from 6 meters to 7.5 meters, while repairing lighthouses, buoys, and purchasing a 30-ton crane to give it a loading and unloading capacity of 1 million tons. Currently, the bureau is focusing on repairing the east breakwater. When the parts impacted by typhoon waves in May this year were rushed to repair, they unexpectedly encountered a wind disaster again when they were completed. More than 70 meters of the dike body facing the most violent wind and waves was washed away. They have decided to make large concrete blocks and rush to repair the dike body as the central work for next year, requiring 6,000 tons of cement, totaling NT$10 million. The bureau solemnly pointed out that if it cannot be completed next year and is hit by a typhoon again, Hualien Port will be over like a dreamlike lotus!</p>
<p>The inspection team received the care of Xu Renshou, Director of Keelung Port Bureau, and Captain Tong Sun of Tang Shipping. We used the bureau's steamship to inspect the port for a week. It happened that the 2,700-ton L.S.T. from Japan was parked there, carrying more than 260 Japanese expatriates back to their country. The two points were fluttering, and the waves were raging. We left the ship and inspected the breakwater slightly. The scene of urgent repair was already visible.</p>
<p>Immigrant Village: Tour of the Demonstration Farm</p>
<p>The Japanese had such a plan 30 years ago to make Taiwan a Taiwan of the Japanese, and the Taiwanese who had lived and thrived for generations were transplanted to Nanyang and other places. The establishment of the government-run immigrant village in Taitung meant this. They used Taitung Hualien Port as a testing ground and expanded it to the central plains. They had already selected 15 villages as shelters.</p>
<p>The Japanese government gave them great convenience for this planned and purely aggressive immigration. A dedicated office was established in the government agencies to be responsible for supervising, encouraging, and autonomous training. The government gave them official land to cultivate, huge funds, and the villages were equipped with nurseries, schools, hospitals, halls, cooperatives, and an ideal residence, improving their lives and encouraging them to fish and collectivize self-cultivation farmers and immigrants, making management scientific and management rationalized. The four immigrant villages of Yoshino, Toyota, Hayashida, and Mizuho in the territory have achieved remarkable results, and Yoshino Village is even known as a model village. The total population of these four villages is 2,705 people, 585 households, with a total area of more than 41,900 acres, accounting for 10.2% of the county's area.</p>
<p>After the restoration, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry took them over and converted them into demonstration farms. Now they are planting successive crops of rice, rotating crops of sugar cane, tobacco, and sweet potatoes, and have sugar cane, coffee, processing plants, and rice mills. The total income of its agricultural products accounts for 10% of the county's output. The demonstration farm is now looking forward to adopting collective farming methods, because the cultivated land is flat, and the adoption of a large agricultural management system and the use of machine farming can increase production efficiency and is also suitable for extensive conditions.</p>
<p>Aluminum and Nickel Plants: Urgent Resumption of Work</p>
<p>There are several factories in Hualien, the more famous are the aluminum and nickel factories. What the local people are most concerned about at present is that the government wants to move these two factories away, and at the same time move the 76,000 K·W· power generation equipment that can only consume more than 2,000 now to Fujian. This power equipment was originally completely to supply the two factories, especially aluminum, which requires 36,000 K·W· of consumption during wartime industrial production.</p>
<p>The rain in the port has a chill. We still follow the planned plan to visit. The aluminum plant with a capital of 600 million yen is located on the edge of the port. In the past, the Japanese transported sand blocks from Manila to be refined into aluminum here and in Kaohsiung. One ton of aluminum sand can refine 40 kilograms of aluminum through electrical decomposition, and one aircraft city requires 1.5 tons of aluminum. It is said that the monthly output of the factory is 20,000 tons. The reporter took a cursory look at this factory, which was full of desolation and almost a scorched earth. The Allied radar had not let it go, and the electrolytic parts, cement, and charcoal blocks were scattered in a mess, soaked in rainwater. Transformers and large arc rectifiers were all blown to pieces. The Resources Committee has decided to cooperate with the Canadian aluminum plant and use all its strength to resume work at the Kaohsiung plant first, and Hualien Port is preparing to give up. The reporters all believed that the Hualien Port Water Products School, which is suitable for Hualien, is quite ideal because it faces the fishing port of the Pacific warm current.</p>
<p>Underground Objects: Iron Minerals are the Richest</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a rumor in this province that coal was found in Taitung, which can be mined, but after the Geological Survey Institute of this province went to investigate, it proved that the so-called coal seam was only some pieces of wood that had been carbonized and buried in the gravel layer. Bi Qingchang, the director of the institute, told reporters about the underground resources of eastern Taiwan. He said that what is already known here are natural gas (gas), placer gold, and magnesium-containing minerals. The following is a brief report:</p>
<p>There are several natural gas leaks in the southern suburbs of Taitung County and the southern section of the Coastal Mountains. The rising gas has also created mud volcanoes. Natural gas itself is a fuel, but the reason why it can attract people's attention is actually because there is a possibility of discovering oil under it. There are many places in Taiwan that produce natural gas. According to years of exploration, the lower layer does not necessarily contain oil. Because eastern Taiwan is close to the Central Mountains made of metamorphic rocks that can never store oil, and to the east is the Pacific Ocean, and the structure of the Oceanic Mountains is very complex, the geological conditions are more unfavorable than the west. Although we cannot absolutely deny it now, it is a possible oil field, but if we say that we should pay attention to it, I am afraid it will be the last one in this province.</p>
<p>The placer gold in eastern Taiwan is mostly produced on the eastern slope of the Central Mountains, and it is relatively more abundant in the Central Mountains in Hualien Port County. Placer gold is usually produced in older terraces composed of gravel. These terraces are widely distributed in the mountains. Seven or eight years ago, a technician estimated an amazing amount of gold reserves based on the richer parts and inferred the whole, so this technician suddenly became a hero and became a guest of honor of Kobayashi Seizō, the former governor of Taiwan. But later it was found that not all of the terraces in the mountains contained a high gold content, almost making a big joke. Although a relatively accurate estimate has not been obtained since then, it can already be said to be at most an ordinary placer gold deposit. Because traffic is difficult at present, there is no possibility of development for the time being.</p>
<p>The magnesium-containing minerals in eastern Taiwan include serpentine, olivine, chlorite, dolomite, and asbestos. They are produced along the Central Mountains and Coastal Mountains from Suao to Taitung. The only one that already has economic value is the asbestos in Fengtian, Hualien County. Now, because magnesium is required in the process of manufacturing chemical fertilizers, and fertilizers are the most needed things in Taiwan in the future, serpentine and other things will also be useful things. The geological survey institute recently conducted a general survey of magnesium-containing minerals in Taiwan Island. The eastern Taiwan has the most reserves, which is sufficient to supply the needs of fertilizer manufacturing.</p>

<p>Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan's Recent Photo: Amazing Singing, Better Than an International Orator; Transforming into Thousands, Emitting Sounds in English, French, and German. Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan, a Visiting Singer and Scholar; A Famous Sister in the Parisian Student Community</p>
<p>December 21st, Parisian Aviation News</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Hong Yuan in Paris</p>
<p>The Parisian student community all praises Ms. Xiaoyan's singing ability. Because of the introduction of celebrities in the art world and leaders of social circles, an appointment was made to meet at her residence. At about 3:30, I rushed to her residence. Ms. Xiaoyan's temples were surrounded by dark clouds. She wore a black Western-style shirt and applied some vermilion color. It was even better than a good night's gathering with the addition of a short Chinese embroidered "Tuanhua Yan Hai" pattern cape. Ms. Xiaoyan grew up in Hubei (Hankou), and speaks both Beijing and Shanghai languages fluently. She is well versed in the languages and literature of France, England, Germany, and other countries. A portrait of Xiao Lingxiao's hidden wife is hung on the wall, which is lifelike and realistic. The sunlight is in the window, the aroma of tea fills the air, the clear words are refreshing, and wonderful thoughts are born.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiaoyan's father was originally a big banker, and now serves as the director of the United Relief Administration. He has always been fond of music and singing and has made great efforts to promote vocal music education. There are three sisters in the family in China, all who are accomplished. Two younger brothers, one remained in the province, and unfortunately, died in the war. Another accompanied her overseas and died in France. She said that her mother was very sad and always comforted herself with the thought that "all children without fathers are my children."</p>
<p>As for music, China has many talented people but very few opportunities. There are even fewer opportunities to hear good music in various parts of the country, unlike the countries bordering Europe, which are easy to learn from each other. She believes that there are three essential elements for pursuing knowledge in depth: one is talent, the second is environment, and the third is effort. The third element means that one should work hard to improve everything. Last year, on National Day in October, I went to Berlin to sing three times. The first time was a Chinese gathering, chaired by Miao Pei, a counselor from the Chinese Military Delegation in Germany. Since then, I held personal concerts twice at the Renaissance Theater, both of which were full. Germans are deeply fond of music. They would rather go hungry than lack this spiritual food. After that, I broadcasted once on the Berlin Radio Station, and then showed me the comments in the German newspapers, such as: "Ms. Xiao's singing deeply touched the hearts of the audience." Such as: "Ms. Xiao's pronunciation of songs in various languages is very accurate and clear, which is very commendable."</p>
<p>Talented Soprano with Clear Tone</p>
<p>I asked Ms. Xiao why she could sing the tunes in English, French, German, and Italian so perfectly. Ms. Xiao replied: Every time I learn a song in a certain language, I always ask a person from that country to be my teacher, and at the same time, I also teach language lessons and study the texts in the newspapers. For example, the Italian classical Western song, Italian title Chi vuol la Zirogarella, translated into Chinese means "Who Likes This Wandering Girl?" The European wandering ethnic group Tzingari live in no fixed place and mostly make a living by selling skills, similar to the Jianghu (wandering entertainers) in China. Another example is the English classical Western song Zymphs and Shepherds, which means water nymphs and shepherds. Another example is the German romantic Western song, which is a "style" of Schubert's famous work. The German title Wohinp is between them, which means "Where to Go?" Another example is the French new Western song Colibri, which means "Hummingbird" in Chinese. One by one, like counting family treasures, they were all able to explain their meaning and detail their origin. When singing, she transforms into thousands, emitting sounds in various languages, showing magic skillfully, and showing cunning skillfully, better than the first-class international orators. She is a natural propaganda fighter for China, not only showing the high talent of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Clamshell Song Expresses Sadness</p>
<p>As for Xiao Zisheng's original French work, which was performed by the Russian A. Tcherepnine as a French classic, the clamshell spirit came down to earth, and the sorrow of separating from her husband for twenty years. The general idea is that a certain person is a farmer, has been a single man for a long time, is honest and hardworking, and always cooks his own meals. One day, when he returned home, the meal was cooked, as if someone had cooked it for him. The same was true the next day. He was surprised and traced it, only to know that every day there was a clamshell spirit who transformed into a young girl and sneaked into his room to do her job well, and he was happy and hid her shell. The clamshell spirit could not get through, so the king allowed her to temporarily marry this country man as his wife, an occasional marriage, limited to twenty years. The French song is performing, describing the situation of this pair of men and women who are full of green and want to say goodbye, so the words are sad and the voice is suppressed. Xiao Jun wrote this to promote the excellent nature of</p>
<h3>Cremation: Only Promotion, Not Coercion</h3>
<p>Senator Tang Shichang believes that the city government's active cleanup measures are inappropriate and should be improved. He stated that the city government's proclamation on November 22nd stipulated that the tens of thousands of accumulated coffins in the city must all be moved for burial or transported back to their place of origin by the end of April; otherwise, they would be cremated. Regarding this point, he specifically asked the mayor to pay attention to the following: (1) Our country's old etiquette and moral teachings attach great importance to the ceremony of final arrangements. The city government can only promote cremation and cannot force cremation. (2) Our country's methods for preserving corpses are extremely thorough, and even those that have been coffined for decades do not pose a health hazard. (3) There are not many public cemeteries in the city, and the fees are extremely high. Moreover, transportation to the countryside is inconvenient, so relocating for burial or returning to one's place of origin are both difficult.</p>
<p>Senator Zhang Zhongyuan asked: Regarding the Social Bureau's assessment committee's adjudication of labor-management disputes, if either party has questions or disagrees after the adjudication: (1) Can a re-assessment be requested? (2) Can senators attend as observers? Also, what is the current progress regarding the mayor's previous statement about negotiating with the Race Club to reclaim the racecourse?</p>
<p>Rationing of Goods: Improvements Needed</p>
<p>Senator Xia expressed dissatisfaction with the measures for rationing goods to public and educational personnel: (1) Is the city government ultimately responsible for the rationing of goods? There are too many abuses. How can they be improved? (2) Items such as candy are not needed by public and educational personnel; they should not be distributed. (3) The procedures are too cumbersome. Can they be simplified? (4) Prices should not be too low to prevent resale on the black market, but appropriate preferential treatment should also be given. (5) Can rationing be scheduled regularly?</p>
