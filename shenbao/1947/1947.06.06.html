<h3>穩定中國秈值需要經濟援助</h3>
<p>程天放在美談稱</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山四日電〕出席聯合國經濟社會理事會巴黎會議之中國代表程天放，今日在此問宣稱：穩定中國貨幣與戰後經濟，需款甚巨，指定貸華之五億美元、將為其中第一期借款。程氏不欲揣測最後或將需要幾何借款。但但指出當初進出口銀行指定五億美元時，中國官定美匯為法幣二千元對美金一元，此刻官定匯率爲一萬二千元，黑市則為三萬三千元，除非美國在六月底以前對此借款有所決定，否則美國國會對於借款問題勢必重新討論。共和黨衆議員裘特及其他議員，近在華府告余謂，彼等將促國會在六月底以前，有所決定。國務卿馬歇爾確曾試謀實現國共間不可能的和解，但中共從未試謀和解，彼等從來不願合作，僅佯為出此，以爭取時間而欺騙外界。通貨膨脹之惡化循環，因與中共之繼續糾紛而更形惡化，結果通貨膨脹一再加甚。程氏最後表示，將在美國與加拿大游歷數月，然後返國。</p>
<h3>大連工業被拆除</h3>

<h3>無錫各報全停刊　負債超過資產無法維持</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫五日電〕錫邑日報，有錫報，人報，大錫報，江蘇民報，導報五家，因受物價上漲影響，負債額已超過資產總値，發行廣告諸費無法比例增加，半月以來，每報虧耗平均每天達一百萬元，印刷工友及職員工薪無法發放，今日日報公會召開緊急會議，決定自六日起，全部休刊，並呈請縣府查封資產，拍賣償債。據日報公會表示，休刊原因有二：（一）過去各報收支不能相抵，均高利倍貸，負債過鉅，拆息一項，不勝負擔；（二）印刷工友工資戰前底薪十二元至二十二元，勝利後工資以米計算，平均自二石二斗至三石三斗，因此各報能難以負祖，一再與工友磋商，應恢復戰前底薪，照生活指數以七折發給，工人方面表示必須照原來底薪以現市米價折合計算，雙方意見懸殊，終成僵局，不得已</p>
<h3>中共航空學校內幕</h3>
<p>— 中央社記者　王萬鈞</p>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕中國共產黨已開始其以飛機空襲南京之企圖。此種企圖，雖因中共目前並無空軍，且距離使用運輸機或偵察機之條件亦相去太遠，但中共黨人現正憑藉外力，在地處東北邊境之東安城附近山地中，設立航空學校，以訓練其欲使幻想成為事實之航空人才。彼等心目中之空軍搖籃地，現設置於北緯四十五度，東經一三三度，合江省東南中蘇邊境烏蘇里江以西，興凱湖以北，位於虎林至林口鐵路上之東安城西北山地中。據偽滿氣象報告所載，該地地處北寒帶，常有寒流侵襲，氣溫最高四十二度，秋未降雲，四月解凍，春夏多暴風。</p>
<p>中共於抗戰勝利後，立即自延安遺派其僅有之航空大隊，由會留一蘇學習駕駛之常乾坤領導，由山東龍。渡海至遼東半易之莊河，由莊河繼鐵道至瀋陽，轉赴通化。即於該地移用由某方協助取得之日本敎練機約四十架，設立航空總隊，嗣以通化行將被國軍攻佔，該隊乃聽遷松江省之牡丹江。卅五年初，該隊為取得供應方便計，乃自牡丹江移至合江省之東安，正式改為航空學校，由常乾坤任校長。該校現有學員一百餘人，飛行班僅有一期卒業，均係由抗日大學（山東莒縣）出身之共軍中挑選者，且係全部選自該校第五期之第五文化工作隊，共四十二人。數月前，一人被火車軋死，另一人因故負傷海汰，故其畢業飛行員只四十人，第二期另設機械科，有學生七十餘人，去年八月畢業，機械科學生多選自「忠實可靠」之共軍幹部中。東北籌共軍中雖有航空人才，亦決不選錄，中共對其唯一之航空學校，對外嚴守絕對秘密，雖屬幹部並不知有此航空學校，局外人更無法知悉內情。該校對外名義為「六一部隊」。</p>
<p>全校設校務處，敎育處及政治部，敎育處設飛行及機械兩科。飛行科主任王連曾，由延安派遺至蘇聯學習飛行，機據科主任為一韓共，乃由北韓調來者，領導飛行員隊長劉某，亦曾在蘇學習航空，副隊長為顯晋。教官約十餘人，均為被共軍强迫留用之日幃人。其中韓籍一人，餘為日籍。該校並附有機務隊（管理飛機）及修理廠二所，除主管人員外，多為日人。至其訓練方式，因所用敎官為日韓及曾留蘇者，故採日蘇制度，講義亦均由日蘇航校敎材，譯為中文。訓練分初高兩級，學科有飛行修理，飛行學，機械學，物理學，政治學，數學等數種。該校所用以訓練之飛機·均屬日本在東北殘留之敎　機，多九式單行擎。彼等所構之「雙機」，即雙引撃者，僅有四五校共有較完整及殘破飛機約百飛機年限旣久，機身復因隨時遷動，彈痕　體，無一完整，極難駕　衡，引擎發動不易，故因練習失事者，月必十餘起，受訓之飛行員，多不敢練習起飛，雖已畢業’而從未駕機凌空之學員，幾佔十九。</p>
<p>中國共產黨企圖以武力攫取政權，惟深苦地面部隊力量之薄弱，故陰謀訓練飛行人員，一且時機成熟，即可自空中獲得力量，遂其叛國野心。渠等寄託於此烏蘇里江岸上航空學校者，至為殷切，惟另有更堪注意者，即中共將此校設於東安，此地交通四達，故其以大批糧食物資，對外交換之飛機及航空器材，可運行無阻，取給便利，且若該校校址遭受國軍成脅時，則可由鐵道迅速他還，此亦在彼等計劇之中。記者撰述此文，乃根據近月向國軍投誠之該校第、一期畢業學員王景川，及該校學生孫善述所口述者。王景川係共黨山東抗大第五期學生，共黨黨員，在校學科成續，據自稱頗為優秀。渠以共黨前在陝北號召之「對日戰爭勝利後，即停戰」，年來迄未能兌現，反加厲流竄鬥爭，從使同胞受苦，乃毅然向國軍投減。以下為王君談話之一段，用作本文之結束，「共產黨高級領袖非常重視，並珍貴我們的學校，但我們雖已學習飛行將近一年，仍然對飛行是門外漢；原因是我們所學習駕駛的飛機，全是日本留存的破碎不堪的飛機。他們夢想有一日能够讓我們駕機空襲南京。同學們對此都暗自認為可笑。這簡直如神話一般荒唐。不過站在中國人民的立塲，我願政府注意一點：即共產黨為了獲得飛機，是會不惜手段的。他們除了用糧食和其他物資交換，還可以拿出賣祖國權益的條件，對付換其所需要的一切。我們校長曾數次告我們，現在用的教練機雖殘破不堪，但我們學習完成後，在國境某地，正有很多性能良好的飛機等着我們云使用。他更說現在我們航空設備不好，只要我們慢慢不斷的幹，未來總可綀出龐太的空中力量，助我們達到目的地至於目的地是南京，還是所有全中國四萬萬五千萬善良老百姓的頂上讓他們嚐嚐炸彈的滋味，我（王景川自稱）便不知道了。」</p>

<h3>片山哲發表談話　日擬派代表團來華　據謂兩國關係應予修正</h3>

<h3>鯉贈巡禮之三　曲阜「三月不知肉味」</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　章繩治</p>
<p>從兗州循着一條泥土公路，向東踏上了孔子家鄉的曲阜縣境。半路上遇着許多簇新的十輪大卡車，上面滿滿裝着軍用的補給品，這一連串的行列，正是說明了國軍在魯南戰鬥中佔據優勢的唯一條件。</p>
<p>公路的建築，出乎意外的平坦，因為彎道的不多，可以稱得上「捷徑」兩個字。原來這是山東平原上的一個特點，沒有河道，沒有山嶺，在路上劃出一條直綫來，就很容易成了一條平坦的公路。</p>
<p>因為天氣太乾燥的織故，好多小河道都枯涸了，河床的細沙全部暴露在太陽光底，遠遠的望去，顏色白白地，倒知像一條水泥築的公路。</p>
<p>公路兩旁，偌大無邊際的沙土層上，僅僅靠着幾業墳樹，作為唯一的點綴品，由此我們想到魯南的苦旱，該與缺乏樹林是有着述帶的關係。但是事實與理想却成了反比例，魯南原有的一些樹木，因為居民的鬧燃料荒和經年戰鬥中需要木料來作工事的緣故，非但沒有培養，反而連根多被拔去了。</p>
<p>最可惋惜的。尤其是風景區曲阜城外的「聖地御道」上，兩旁所有的　長的白楊樹，亦有好多被砍掉了，剩下來的，僅是一棵一棵白色的根頭，看上去覺得格外的刺眼。想起往昔濃蔭夾道的情景，該是多麼可咒罵的事！</p>
<p>曲阜這一個因孔子而成名的小城，唯一與衆不同的地方，它充滿了古色古香的情調，年齡在千百歲以上的古柏，和長衫曳地白髮飄飄的老年人，同樣的會令人的勾起思古的悠情。街道上假使沒有軍車的奔馳煩　，將是多麼的「幽靜」和「斯文」呢！</p>
<p>看到民屋上的門脾戶名，不難找出許多孔門的後裔來。當小學我飯學的時候，隨隨便便的就會遇到幾個姓孔的小學生，談起來，原來他們就是「聖府」裏面的小主人。</p>
<p>這襄的物價並不因偏處一隅的緣故，而與生活水準的低落成為正比例。相反的當我們向城裏的居民問及米價和肉價的時候，却給予我們一個値得傷感的答獲，一位主婦說：「我們吃不到這些東西，所以價錢亦知不到」！</p>
<p>想不到二千年前，孔夫子在安貧樂道的環境中，聽了音樂以後說的那句「三月不知肉味」的風凉話，竟在二千年後，就在他的家鄉內，因為兵荒馬亂和民生凋敝的緣故，而眞的「不知肉味」了。况且時間上又何止像他老人家所說「三個月」的短促呢？</p>
<p>在縣政府裏會到了王縣長，這位在山東打過游繫的大物，胖胖的個子，彪形的身材，說話倒是挺痛快。在他的談話中，除了報告一些縣政工作旣兄外，還希望記者替他呼籲呼籲，弄點救濟物資去。一切都和意料中一樣，亦與任何一縣的縣長的口吻一樣，說來說去，離不開一個「窮」字。</p>
<p>論到曲阜的情勢，我們可以從城門口的檢查哨上看出一般來：一個哨兵並不因為縣長和我們在一起，而肯輕輕放渦這一關，出城和進城一定要我舞把名字和人數寫下來，雖然結果我舞並沒有這樣做。此外這位哨兵還報告了一個「情報」，說有兩個穿軍裝帶武器的和兩個「便衣」乘着車子跑進城去了。事後，我們聽了他的話，和看到他的那副緊張的神態，不禁都大笑起來。原來進兩位「便衣」，就是這次同遊的同業。另外的兩位武裝者，一位是憲兵第三團的張團長，一位便是八十四師的新聞處長。</p>

<h3>上海市參議會的成就</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第三次大會自五月廿六日開慕以來，連日討論各種重要議案，原定於三日閉幕，惟因提案尙未討論者尙多，乃一再延會，至五日下午始圓滿閉幕。這次會議適在學潮洶湧社會動盪的時候舉行，全體參議員對於今後上海市政的應興應革，特將其重點置於「安定」的一點上，尤其對於疏導學潮所採取的辦法，値得我們的稱道。上海所以能安然渡過「六二」的難關，這次市參議會能介於市民與政府之間，努力疏導學潮，使當局與學生勿各趨於極端，實有極大的貢獻。凡是眞正能代表人民的意志去幹任何事情，沒有不會有相當的收穫的，亦可於此獲一明證。</p>
<p>惟我們默察一般市民對於此次市參議會的決議，所最感興趣者，與其說是在國家大事，市政大計，倒不如說在於與本身有切膚之痛的許多瑣碎問題上。因為所謂政治者，就是衆人之事，管理衆人之事的最高原則，就在乎能增進衆人的幸福，减少衆人的痛苦。現代民主政治的優點，也就是在民情得以上達，人民不論在物質生活方面有什麼痛苦，或是在精神上感覺到何種煩悶，都有其選出的代表為其喉舌，代其叫喊，促其解除。潘議長在這次市參議會開幕之前，特別赴上海各區訪問市民，探求民意之所在，同時又舉行了七天的各區市政座談會，籍以交換市政興革的意見，俾能提出參議會討論，商量出一個具體辦法，來交市政當局切實執行；這辦法是値得稱許的</p>
<p>潘議長按其視察各區區政的經過，綜合為十二個現實的問題，提供市參議會商討。這十二個現實問題，大率有關市民的日常生活，，似乎並不高談闊論，更無新奇之處。（一）確定各區民代表會暨各區公所之職權及其地位，以樹立地方自治之基礎；（二）應運解決各區民代表會·區公所·暨各保之辦公處所；（三）應卽與江蘇省政府確定劃界；（四）速以自來水供應貧民區，任一般貧民　飮，以免夏令發生時疫；（五）發展郊區之交通道路以及水電供應，俾人民能向效區移居：（六）迅速修築各區道路，以便利市民的行；（七）從速解決本市垃圾及糞便問題，以重公共衛生；（八）指導並糾正貧民搭蓋棚屋，以防火災；（九）增加浦西與浦東的輸渡，以改善交通：（十）機塲之佔地應分別征用給價或發還，其他民地民房民倉被佔者亦應一律交涉發還，以安民命：（十一）迅速淸除各郊區之浮厝；（十二）應速設法撥給各區建築學校之基地。以展開獻校運動。這些與市民生活有關的問題，並不需要用高深的理論來解釋和說明，但僅需要市政當局認眞實行而已。或許這些零碎的平凡的問題，不為一般高談市政者所重視，但我們却覺得非常切要</p>
<p>我們應該看到：今日之上海，在表面上雖披着一件繁榮美麗的外衣，但按之實際，早已投射下百業蕭條民不聊生的黑影！尤其在郊區僻壤，或者在貧民聚居的地方，如果拿來和酒綠燈紅，紙醉金迷的許多塲所相比，簡直可以看出今日之上海，已劃分了兩個截然不同的世界：一個是天堂，個個是幸運者，度着他們豪華的生活，所謂揮金如土的銷金窟；另外一個去是人間地獄，食不果腹，衣小廠體，上無片瓦，下無寸土，而且又在高物價的壓迫下，苟延殘喘，朝不保暮。我們若要繁榮市面，我們若要謀得上海的安定，在安定中更求進步，則上海市政當局不能不設注改進，以提高平民大衆的生活水準，因爲在目前的上海，市民之在天堂度其奢侈豪華的生活者，實在佔着極少數，而大多數的市民被　迫　生活的重祖下，幾乎連氣也喘不過來了！他們無時不迫切盼望市政當局，能够注意到他們非人的生活。市長以及各局處長，都是親民之官，如果也常常輪流分赴各區實地察訪，我們相信對於許寧在飢餓綫上掙扎的市民，一定能更多了解　由於他們惻隱之心的發動，積極的站在大多數平民方面設身處地以求改進他們的生活，則上海市政當有顯著的改觀。</p>
<p>其次，我們特別欽佩市參議會眼光的遠大，與決議的果敢。例如大上海都市計劃的審查報告與大會決護，雖祇寥寥數條，而對於該計劃之必須配合國防與東方大港之建設，以及劃區原則之決定，審查都市計劃常設委員會之設置，均為有關今後上海發展之百年大計，不失為從小處做起從近處行起之遠大目標。又如「遝反中國人民利益活動調查委員會」之倡議組織，雖自上海一市着手，而將來都可影響及於全國。在這一點，市參議會不啻指出了全國眞正民意機關在最近的將來所應共同努方的一種重要工作。這工作，站在國家和人民的立塲上看來，如何審愼正確的幹好，使得中國社會裏不復潛伏着居心違反中國人民利益的可怖分子，從事於破壞祖國的活動，實在是太重要了。美國國會裏早有「非美國活動調查委員會」的組織，他們對於一般遠反美國利益的人們的活動，調查得異常詳密，發表的報告為世人所重視，美國政府執行國策時也往往把這委員會的報告作為重要的參考材料。我國以前還沒有人民或人民代表自動起來為國家做這類工作，而此次市參議曾大會竟能首先發動，實已顯示了他們的遠見與果斷。我們很盼望市民能够充分的眞誠的，在參議會推動之下，負起精確調查的責在來，其於國家和平社會安定的貢獻，必極重大的。</p>
<h3>武漢行轅綏靖區今日開行政會議　房縣冰雹災重省府撥二千萬急賑</h3>

<h3>匈成立共產政府　杜魯門斥爲非法　英美向蘇索閱致匈文件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：杜魯門總統今日抨擊匈牙利共黨政府，指陔政府爲不法，並謂美國對此決不袖手旁觀。杜魯門總統今在招待會中言明國務院將調查整個匈牙利事件，因陔處局勢極爲嚴重也。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕國務院本日宣佈：該院請求盟國對匈牙利管制委員會美代表覓取該委會蘇聯主席提交匈政府全部情報之副本，「因各方消息一致認爲匈總理那　之辭職，係由於蘇方提出此項情報之結果」。國務院發言人說明此種文件，有關英美政府之利益，根據管制委會所定條文，美國有索閱此項文件副本之權利。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦五日電〕匈牙利盟國管制委會英代表，已與美國採取一致行動，向蘇代表索取蘇方交予匈政府使前總理那　辭職之文件。據此問一匈記者稱，那　之辭職，純以獲蘇方充分支持之匈國共產黨之「政治勒詐」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約四日電〕此間人士評述匈牙利之政局曰：那　總理之被迫辭職，及匈牙利設立親蘇政府一事。實可視爲莫斯科對杜魯門主義之第一次反擊。今美國停止以借款貸予匈牙利，此舉適足對該國反蘇人士予以最嚴重打擊。杜魯門總統與馬歇爾杰認爲此一措施徒勞無功，反將予以藉口，使蘇聯在該國建立　勞。閱華盛頓亦擬向蘇聯揚出抗議，觀察家對此則皆懷疑此舉能否收效，蓋遷延時日，蘇聯可乘機固其所已取得之據點，以底定其控制東南歐與中歐之　權故也。匈牙利受其控制後，則蘇聯可將羅馬尼亞與西方之聯絡切斷，該國實行西方之民主政治亦將因此不可能。捷克素欲成爲平衡東西三方勢力之樞軸，亦將因此處於蘇聯壓力之下。尤要者，奧地利亦將被　錐所夾住，無以摧行民主政治。匈牙利南面之南斯拉夫，其領袖蒂托最近發表之演說，且預示有與南方斯拉夫族成爲一個聯邦之意，凡此種種皆應注意及之云。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾坦率指陳　歐洲局勢殊嚴重　反對任何政府奴役他國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：馬歇爾今在哈佛大學同學會發表重要演說，籲請歐洲各國國結一致，進行偉大之重建工作，謂美國在此方面將盡其所能，予以協助。同時馬歇爾指出：「凡阻礙他國復興之政府，美國將反對之」。馬卿　未指明任何國家，但稱凡欲奴役他人以求本身利益者，將遭美國之猛烈反對。馬歇爾復稱：「在未來三四年中，歐洲必須獲得更多之援助，否則將發生經濟及政治上之崩潰。美國之政策，並不針對任何國家及主義，其所針對者，乃貧乏，飢饉與動亂而已。美國必盡其力，促使世界經濟復蘇，良以經濟不復興，則政治無從安定，政治不安定，則無和平可言。在美國未實施更多援助之前，歐洲各國必須就局勢之需要成立協議，俾明確其各個之職責」。最後馬歇爾强調稱：「歐洲方面，現已迅速發生一極爲嚴重之局勢，其對世界甚爲不利，對德奧和約未能成立協議，已使復興大爲阻緩」。</p>
<h3>美議員抨擊　蘇干涉匈內政</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕參議院今日繼續辯論前德國附屬國之和平條約，密西西比州右翼參議員伊斯特蘭，曾嚴重抗議蘇聯之使匈牙利成爲其「藩邦」，並力主由聯合國機構採取行動，以維護和平，保障匈牙利人民之自由。渠並謂突圍若僅事提出一紙抗議書，無　對蘇綏靖，英國茲當採取肯定的立塲及行動，如採取措施以驅逐蘇聯出於聯合國機構以外等。最後參院決定於明晨就批准　　匈保四國和約事作最後　決，聞阿干薩斯民主黨參議員傳彌勃萊特暨其他議員多人，正企圖使對義和約之批准延至明年一月廿五日決定，但料彼等之力量，猶不中以阻止該一和約之通過。</p>
<h3>蘆田談新閣外交政策　日覬覦冲繩等島　美銀行考慮對日本貸欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東京五日廣播：日外相蘆田均今招待外籍記者，據談日本並無重整軍備之意，而僅願「收回若干小島如硫磺，琉球等而已。」蘆田又稱：硫磺島對於日本之經濟並不重要，但日本全國「由於感情作用」，甚欲予以收回。關於和約，日本同意早日開始談判。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京五日電〕外務大臣蘆田均今日接見記者稱：如盟國允許日本能有必要之警察力量，可携有機關槍與手槍，則日政府在和約簽字以後，定能維持治安與秩序。「吾人無意於提出重整軍備問題，因吾人在新憲法之下，業已廢止戰爭也」。記者詢以日政府是否考慮防止侵略問題，蘆田答稱：「吾人或將依賴於聯合國，雖吾人尚不知在簽訂和平條約後，聯合國是否立即允許吾人加入」。蘆田又稱：渠尚未知初步和平談判，何時開始，迄今爲止，關於此一問題，日本尚未與各盟國代表，有過任何會議。渠稱：日政府對和約建議，已作「充分準備」。在答復記者問題時，蘆田稱：領土經濟問題，在未來和平條約談判中，或爲重要項目中之一。日本之國境，早由波茨坦宣言加以決定，但對於若干島嶼，如冲繩·千島列島·北海道以東，九州以南之各小島，仍有若干未加確定。蘆田又力持賠款問題，須作「切於實際之解決」。渠指出上次大戰後凡爾賽和約下之德國賠款解決，實爲一切實際之舉云。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕蘆田本日招待外國記者團時强調日本目前最大希望乃迅速步入等常之國際關係。蘆田稱：此事非僅在世界和平關係上，尤其復興東亞，更屬必要。在重建中日之友好關係上，亦爲一新出發點。關於賠償問題，蘆田希望早日獲知具體方案，如以何種工塲及何種生產品充賠償之用。最後，蘆田談及國際局勢時，認爲一般最關心之美蘇戰爭，不致發生。因美蘇兩國間並無非以戰爭手段不能解決之重大問題存在也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕傳願以五千萬美元貸予日本之兩銀妊發行人今日稱：此事仍在未定狀態中。紐約亨利許魯德銀行發言人，評論紐約時報東京訊所傳該行及舊金山美國銀行，已向麥帥提出願以五千萬美元貸予日本一事稱：談判僅討論貸款之性質，貸款數目並未確定。同時美國銀行之發言人稱：此訊係因各方嘗試討論資助日本進出口事業方法而來者，全部事實，仍在未定階段。據紐約時報東京訊稱：此項貸款，係與麥帥最近之建議有關，麥帥最近建議以日本銀行之黃金作抵押，俾資助日本之各項資本原料之進口，蓋日本之工業，必須增加若干進出口也。</p>
<h3>吉田發表談話　反對聯合內閣</h3>
<p>自由黨大野幹事長辭職</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕自由黨爲應付目前局勢，特制定反共親英美之政治路線，並重新起草黨綱，決定二十日召開黨員大會，而對上項路綫，予以載定。又自由黨總裁吉田茂頃以在　黨身份首次發表談話稱：「無反對黨則一切均無法求進步，余去年　與社會黨等，各政黨合組聯合內閣，因斯時與目前之情勢迥異也。現在日本已無須舉國一致之內閣」。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京五日電〕自由黨幹事長及該黨有勞力領袖之一之大野伴睦，已向吉田辭去幹事長職務，辭職原因未詳，前商工省　島二郎將繼大野之遺缺。</p>
<h3>南韓軍政廳　併入臨時政府</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城五日電〕勒琪將軍本日發表談話稱：「南韓軍政廳已決定併入臨時政府，因目下軍政廳中只有本人與　地少將二人爲美國人，其他均爲韓人，故最妥善之辦法莫如將該軍政廳併入南韓時政府。」</p>
<h3>美海軍重視　太平洋基地</h3>
<p>前進基地正移至關島</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：據美報　稱，美國在太平洋之海軍作戰基地，將集中珍珠港，關島·阿拉斯加三角地帶，其前進基地正自珍珠港至關島。</p>
<h3>蒙巴頓與印領袖會商　印分治實施辦法　甘地呼籲回印兩族合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：接受印度分治計劃之印度七大領袖今日與印督舉行會議，討論設立委員會，以研究建立兩自治領國家之辦法，據官方談稱，今後或將繼續舉行會議一二次，商討成立印回劃界委會等問題。準備分治之省區即將遭遇種種問題，如資產與負債之劃分，警務機關·法院·及其他省級機關之劃分等。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里四日電〕關於印度國民大會黨接受英國所宣佈之印度分治計劃一事，聖雄甘地頃特聲明與之並無聯緊。並謂即使不能迫使回盟接受印度統一之議，余亦不能對分治計劃表示茍同。余相信分治結果，必將危及吾四萬萬同胞之福利。甘地繼覆職請回盟會長　納，促其與國大黨合作，勿徒事求取印督之歡心。</p>
<h3>張院長評印度問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京五日電〕行政院張院長今日向本社發表談話，對於英國之決定將印度政權移交印度人民，深致重要，並希望能成立最後解決辦法，使印度全部均能因此本於其本身之利益而合作。張院長稱，中國對於印度之發展，極感興趣。印度面積廣大，種族複雜，統一之任務勢必艱難。不論最後之解決計劃爲如何，余個人切盼印度各族及其領袖，得以迅速完成有效方式之合作，以爲整個印度之利益着想。本人對於英國之決定將印度政權移交印度人民，尤表欽佩云。</p>
<h3>心臟病　發明新療法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社費城四日電〕康奈爾大學心臟副敎授高爾德博士，今日向費城心臟病學會年會致詞稱，由於發明簡單新療法之結果，心臟病患者可望獲得某種程度之解救，此在醫學史上前所未聞。該治療法緊於控制　與水之入口，並每日服用精製洋地黃（即狄吉妥克辛），與局部利尿劑，手續極簡單，且最有效，成功原因在此。無論醫院或家庭輕而易舉，僅需最低限度之看謹監督及飲食攝養。</p>
<h3>美阿決樹立親善關係　勃萊頓辭職照准　美駐阿大使亦有辭職可能</h3>
<p>「聯合社華盛頓四日電」杜魯門總統今日接受副國務卿勃萊登辭呈，適當美國決定與阿根廷重新樹立親善邦交之後二十四小時。勃氏曾率直批評阿根廷政策，現將於本月底卸任。據消息靈通人士揣測，所遣副國務卿一缺或有二法填補。一由國務卿馬歇爾指定外交經歷悠久人士主持勃氏重司之拉丁美洲政策，且兼及各種政治部門。一由馬氏率領助理國務卿總統直接處理西半球以外政務，而另行新覓一副國務卿專司拉丁美洲事宜。同時，駐阿根廷大使梅塞史密斯健康不佳，預料亦將辭職，使梅勃二氏問之爭執告一結束。</p>
<p>〔合眾社阿根廷京城五日電〕阿根廷對於美副國務卿勃萊頓之辭職消息甚表欣慰，但官方均不願發表此事之意見。</p>
<h3>美眾院通過法案　決限制工會活動　總統態度如何殊堪注目</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓四日電〕美眾院深信其能對總統可能提出之否決權，操必勝之把握，今日以三百二十票對七十九票之多數，提出通過折衷之工會統制立法，禁止工會發動罷工，作過去十二年來勞工法最澈底之改革。　料參院在星期四日將採取最後行動，以便該案能在星期四日晚或星期五日交付總統簽署。共和黨政策委員會之塔虎脫預料參院亦將對該案予以壓倒之多數通過，以便粉碎總統之否決權。如杜魯門總統簽受此項勞工法修正案渠即將最後放棄羅斯福新政遺下之親勞工政策。渠亦將犧牲下屆總統競選中之勞工投票。該法案經過參眾國院之幾度會商後始能最後起草成功，其中已取消不少眾院原來限制工會活動之嚴格條款，恢復較溫和之形式，但仍較今年一月杜魯門所交與國會之勞工管理計劃嚴格　甚。美國有組織之工會，業已冀去大量金錢，號召與論界，反對此項法案云。</p>

<h3>渡過警濤駭浪　參議大會閉幕</h3>
<p>議長感謝當局　苦心維護治安　市府施政應注重重點及建設</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第三次大會，自上月二十六日起舉行會議，討論各項提案，審查市府施政報告，確定預算，疏導學潮，歷時十日，業於昨日下午八時四十五分閉會。首由瀋　長致閉幕詞，略謂：本會第三次會議，共舉行十天，在十天會期內，大會及各種小組委員會均盡了相當責任，而正當開會期間，亦正上海社會最緊張之時，風聲鶴唳，我們一方面要討論提案，一方面要顧到社會動態，尤其是學潮問題。結果幸賴治安當局協力處理，使上海情勢從不安寗化爲最安定，這是很可慶幸之事。而對政府當局之苦心，應付辦法之適宜，值得代表市民稱頌。其間雖聽到一部分學生家長對當局措施偶有批評，但爲社會大眾之安寗及愛護青年起見，我們對於政府措施不能不予諒解。此次本會疏導學潮　種委員會會發表文告，並赴各校疏導，充分表示愛護青年之熱忱，及對青年學生之希望，此點亦　覺安慰。本市三十度重編及遍加預算，亦經審查通過，並建議市府以後施政注重重點及建設事業，緊縮機構，此數點均屬十分重要。</p>
<p>努力都市計劃</p>
<p>對大上海都市計劃亦有決議，雖議決者不够詳細，很覺慚愧，但該會特種委員會已相當盡力。今後且將成立常設委員會，當更可出力，有所貢獻，使此計劃能逐步推進實施。我們現在如能按照計劃建設大都市，則五十年後子孫必能受到極大益處。衹要整個國家統一和平，大上海都市計劃，不論靠自己力量或由國際人士協助，其開發之機會一定甚多，不須十年八年即可照我們理想完成。</p>
<p>市參議會大會閉幕時吳市長致詞（本報攝）</p>
<p>市長致詞三點</p>
<p>繼由市長致詞，謂本人有感想數點：（一）此次大會提案具體，討論深切，使本人得益匪淺，而更感到市府責任之重大，不能不格外努力。（二）大上海都市計劃，在現在提出，雖似乎是紙上談兵，但在百年以前，建設上海如有一計劃，則今日之交通等問題即不致如此混亂。正如議長所說，衹要中國能真正和平統一，都市計劃在十年以內，即可完成。否則上海長此以往，後代的人將責備我們。</p>
<p>感謝參會協力</p>
<p>（三）關於治安方面，本人非常感謝市參議會各種疏導，使此重大困難能安然渡過。現事情已過，但可以報告各位者，六月二日確有很大危險，賴軍警當局及參議會之努力得以安定至於市府逮捕學生，決非鹵莽，開列名單非常謹慎。上海學生共計有四萬五千人，經一年之調查，始確定此八十多人，但因公開後諸多不利，故除非到必要時不擬公開。然所有證據均極確實，其中有一學生曾在別處參加暴動，有證據可憑。其他有數人在臥室中公開張貼共黨所辦之「抗日大學」章程，並欲介紹同學投攷該校。</p>
<p>感化被捕學生</p>
<p>對於被捕學生有人主張送法院，但我們爲愛護青年，不予送院，因送法院後，依據證據，不論軍法司法均可判罪。此輩學生均係國家有爲青年而被人利用者，故不用法律制裁而重人情。本擬送往中共區，但爲遵照市參議會意見，決留予感化，使彼等將來均能成爲國家棟梁。</p>
<h3>以正義領導　爲人民服務</h3>
<p>最後陶參議員百川代表市參議員致詞略稱：本人對於此次大會有一感想，即我們討論議案，有小到一學校一區，大到國家，全世界。有人提到小事可不必化了大家許多時間鄭重討論。但本人認爲參議會對大問題固要過問，討論，對小問題亦應過問，討論。在原則上及技術上均應兼顧，所謂「官府之小事，即民間之大事」，我們認爲無是輕重者，在每個個人乃天大之事。參議會乃代表正義，是正義之旗，目前社會上太缺少正義感，我們必須爲市民發揮正義，否則一切計劃一切提案均變成「紙上談兵」。本會同人有此精神，值得繼續下去，以「官府之小事，即民間之大事」爲前提，以「正義」爲領導精神，不畏艱難，替人民服務。</p>
<h3>修正通過壯丁緩召標准　攤販違警不得沒收貨物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府擬訂之「上海市三十六年度壯丁獨負家庭生計聲請緩召標準」經市參議會潘議長交議，昨日大會討論，決議修正：（一）關於獨負家庭生計責任而無同胞兄弟者，應備下列各款：一，應負担家屬一人以上之生活者，二，全年收入每口平均不到食米六市石者（無田產者之其他收入，不及上列食米價值時，亦同）。（二）兄弟二人，其一已殘廢，呈准免役，全家生計惟賴一人獨力維持者，其緩召標準適用第一條各款之規定。</p>
<p>其他議長交議案件，經大會討論者有：（一）「准青島市參議會代電，爲建議中央改參議員爲有給職一案，應否響應，提請討論案」，決議：保留。（二）「本會第二次大會，未決臨時動議：爲攤販違警，其貨不得沒收案」，決議：函請市府令飭警局對攤販違警，其貨物不得予以沒收，依照違警罰法處理。（三）「本會第二次大會未決議案：對於衛生局垃圾車搭運菜販營私舞弊一案，提請公決案」，決議：函衛生局此後仍宜加强管理，以免繼續發生類似事件。</p>
<h3>大上海都市計劃　成立常設委員會</h3>

<h3>施政審查報告　修正文字備覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議大會對於市府施政之審查報告，大致亦已通過，推李文杰，陶百川，朱文德修正報告文將，俾送覆市府辦理。又第二次大會休會期間，各種委員會重要決議案五十三件，亦已由大會追認通過。另關於法規方面，市府交與該會審查本市各種稅捐征收細則及稽核辦法等九種，經大會決議：　　法規，財政二委員會，　納各參議員意見，議決後交下屆大會追認。</p>
<h3>戰前定期存款　請定償還辦法</h3>
<p>整理舊公債案　建議中央考慮</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日大會討論至最後階段時，有荘平等提臨時動議：「建議中央規定戰前吸收定期存款償還辦法，迅予施行，以保國民資產」一案，其原辦法中曾建議中央按目前生活指數償還，當有一部份參議員及徐副議長主張保留，但原提案人等均表反對，結果決議取消按照生活指數辦法，呈請中央規定償還辦法，同時對已到期者應限期償還。此案通過後，王維　·邵永生等又堅持公債案，亦同樣不應予以保留，經決議：「建議中央對於整理舊公債予以考慮」。</p>
<p>此外又通過臨時動議數件：計（一）「請市府轉飭第一區公所即日遷赴民政處原址辦公，以利工作而正觀瞻案」。（二）「請市府收回　沙公產撥充江　區及高橋區作發展敎育基金之用案」，決議：送請市府酌辦。（三）「請市府轉飭公用局，區分三輸送貨車自用車照與營業車照，以維三輪車拖貨工人生活，區別工作，而免糾紛案」，決議：送請公用局斟酌辦理。</p>
<h3>樓國威晋京未出席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海直接稅局局長樓國威，本定昨日再出席參議會繼續報告，後因昨晨樓奉召晋京，故未出席。</p>
<h3>指數不能照實發給　各業糾紛起伏不定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五朋份生活指數發表後，一般資方多表示不能照實發給，尤以機器，翻砂·電器業等爲最，機器工業同業公會且　　通知各會員依四月份指數發給，但各廠盈虧情形不同，故一部份已協議解決，一部份則尚在僵持中。昨日下午勞資雙方皆至社會局陳述困難情形，正由該局調解中。</p>
<p>四區機器業</p>
<p>區包括四十廠商，其中二十三家已決定一次或分期依二萬三千五百倍發給，其餘　中·沅豐·三星·求精·陳興記·上海正記·黃浦等廠則表示仍衹以一萬四千八百倍發給，勞資雙方現尚在爭執中。中國紡織機器公司日前因指數而引起工人　工行爲，經社會局吳局長排解之下，決定先依二萬三千五百倍發給百分之七十，其餘再謀協議，工人表示滿意，已恢復常態。</p>
<p>七區機器業</p>
<p>則因資方皆依照同業公會通知依一萬四千八百倍發給，工人特推代表至社會局請願，據稱如不得解決可能引起怠工情事。</p>
<p>西服業</p>
<p>方面，則有南京西路培琪·凱羅·吳興昌如記·兆豐·萬和祥·開林·隆茂·雷蒙·雷達·培蒙·友聯·恒泰·光明等十三家之縫工，因資方不同意照指數給薪，相率罷工。</p>
<p>又機器業資方昨曾方晤社會局吳局長，要求改變底薪，當爲吳局長所拒絕，認爲底薪已定，今如更改，徒然引起糾紛，目前唯有適度增加工作時間，或自底薪打折扣上想辦法。</p>
<h3>交通公司公共汽車　一度怠工旋即恢復　提兩項要求磋商後解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市公用局所轄公共交通公司之一至十一路公共汽車，昨晨一度發生意工，至十一時始全部恢復行駛。</p>
<p>緣該公司係市政府之事業機關，所有職工薪金，槪依公敎人員待遇爲標準，除茲數三十四萬元，底薪以一千八百倍計算外，另加營業獎金百分之四十。自五月份生活指數公佈後，該公司司機，售票等七百餘人，於前晚十一時集會商討，決議向當局要求二項：（一）依現有底薪，照生活指數實發。（二）實行工作八小時制。公用局趙局長聞訊後，當晚趕往磋商，工人堅持要求，延至昨晨仍未解決。所有司機，售票羣集公平路九五九號工會中等候答覆，俱不上班工作，致使各綫汽車一律停駛。九時許趙局長再度前往磋商，關於薪津問題，因公共交通公司非私人企業，仍依公務員待遇，亦准配給實物，一切依市府法規辦理，並允於實物未領前先發給配售實物與市價之差額金，每人三十萬元。至工作八小時制原則上完全同意，以後如須外担任工，另貼工資。全體工友認爲滿意，乃立即分赴各軍工作，各綫車輛紛紛出廠照常行駛。</p>
<h3>對指數問題　吳開先談話　另定統一變通辦法　目前情形殆不可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳局長昨爲指數解凍後引起工潮，發表談話稱：目前工業界困難，政府自應顧及，惟另定統一變通辦法，殆不可能，因各業業榮枯不同，而各業所屬各廠之生產及營業情形又互異。如能力尚能負担者，自應仍照規定指數發給，其確有困難者，亦應按其差別程度酌量變通，如勉强劃一，反一扦格難行之虞。故各廠如確有不能照指數發給工資困難時，仍應各個別解決，由勞資雙方自行協議折扣發給或延長工作時間以資補救，並望各廠將此項問題提交工廠會議討論，廠方亦應儘量公開生產成本及營業實况，俾勞資間增進諒解，共渡難關。當二月間，政府宣佈工人生活指數凍結之後，全市工人均一致服從，希望物價能不再漲，此種精神殊可嘉慰。歷二·三·四三個月之久，並無煩言。現因物價高漲不已，工人確實苦痛，政府乃另定工資調整辦法。同時亦顧至生產界之情形，故辦法之中除定有折扣外，且有第五條之規定：如各廠商確實不能負担時，可由勞資協議减少之。如協議不能成立時，提請勞資評斷會公　之。政府早有詳盡之辦法，今一部份同葉會會，不知善導各廠，如何分別依此辦理，使各廠與各工會直接開誠協商，而以其他不切實際之方法處理，徒增紛擾，不能解決問題，實屬不合。</p>

<h3>法學院代院長　探視在押學生　屈元小姐泫然涕下　說無書報看悶損甚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海法學院學生因發生互毆案，經地檢處偵查完畢，屈元等十一人，依傷害罪提起公訴，地院決定於下週由吳家祖庭長開審，惟本案被告中除情節較輕者四人已保釋外，現在押者尚有屈元等七人，日來外傳屈元瘦斃獄中，該院代理院長褚鳳儀往地院探詢究竟，並商得查院長之允准，由刑事紀錄科孫恒主科，陪往馬斯南路看守所，探視在押學生，於下午五時入內探視，迄六時許始離去。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全國物價會議通過之上海市工資調整辦法，規定底薪卅元至一百元間之數，以十元爲一級，逐級遞减百分之十之折扣，但一百元以上之數如何計算則未有載明。社會避長吳開先特電請社會部解釋，昨已接谷部長覆電稱：底薪一百元以上之折扣，原辦法未予規定。因此類工人爲數甚少，且多係高級技工，地位重要，關係生產前途甚鉅。故一百元以上部份之折扣，應由各廠自行斟酌情形，主工雙方協議規定，較爲妥當。如有爭執，再提勞資評斷會評斷。</p>

<h3>政院否决寂助經費　全運可能延期　郝更生來滬召籌委洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕郝更生因政院四日政務會議，否決全運會經費補助二十億元一案，特乘五日午車赴滬，與吳市長會商，即將召集全運　委常委會，商討是否由滬市自行設法全會經費，抑另作其他打算。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京五口電〕預定於本年雙十節在上海舉行之全國運動大會，現將宣吿無限期延期。行政院前曾通過撥付全運之補助費，現已改變初衷，據傳行政院所以決定停止撥款，係依照緊縮開支之政策故也。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕第七屆全國運動會籌備委員會總幹事敎育部體育督學郝更生氏，於昨日下午三時半，由京搭機來滬，於當日五時抵滬，據郝氏云：本人此次來滬，係爲全運之進行，對籌備委員會有所報吿。郝氏昨晚分別與有關當局一度洽商，並定今日下午三時半，假市體育館會議室，招待全滬各報社體育新聞記者，作公開之報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕原定本年雙十在滬舉行之第七屆全運會，以經費問題未獲解決，可能延期。按本年四日政院曾通過補助全運會經費十億元，上月初該會首次籌備會在流召開時，通過大會競賽規程，並列經費預算爲一百廿億，該會籌備主任吳國楨，希望中央能補助半數，後經　委會幾次會商，乃將預算緊縮，決定呈請中央補助二十億，昨日政務會議中辯論該問題時以全運會舉行辦法第五項中規定，大會經費如在省市舉行時，其經費田就地政府負担，而決定不予追加，故大會能否如期舉行，當視滬市當局能否負担大會經費而定。</p>
<h3>十二國家接受邀請參加世運</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會限額分配處對第二委若干種輸入品之限額，業已考慮放寬程度，大致照原定限額，增加百分之三十。已知放寬限額之輸入品，紙類中白報紙增加至美金二百五十九萬五千元。木漿方面；資委會紙廠仍爲美金十萬元，民營紙廠增加至美金六十二萬五千元。捲烟紙增加至美金七十八萬元。其他紙類增加至美金五十二萬元。該會各項限額輸入品，其分配比例，上海約佔百分之七十至八十，其餘則分配予外埠。惟肥為一項，以華南需要較多，分配情形例外。該會對二季限額外棉之核配，業已竣事。一俟輸管會執委會通過，即可公布。關於橡嘐之輸入分配事宜，將於下週問，召開該業廠商諮詢會後，再行決定。羊毛限額分配結果，實感不敷，現正由該會向當局洽商通融辦法，使該業有自備外匯者，得向國外輸入羊毛，以資補救云。</p>
<h3>對五縣布廠宣言　紡管會發表聲明　該會從未對各廠直接配紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會業務處劉處長昨爲本月三日武進，無錫，吳縣，常熟，江陰五縣染織工業公會發表敬吿各界書，涉及該會部份，有與事實不符之處，特聲明如次。</p>
<p>渠稱：本會從未直接配紗予各複製廠，惟去年八月三十日起，曾督導國民營紗廠，舉辦聯合配銷棉紗四期。第一期自去年八月三十日起至九月十八日止，共配紗二五七七九件。第二期自去年九月二十三起，至十月十八日止，共配紗一七九六六件。第三期自去年十月二十八日起，至十一月二十一日止，共配紗一九八四二件。第四期自去年十二月二日起，至本年一月六日止，共配紗一八二〇八件。</p>
<p>以上四時期配紗，係由國民營各紗廠通過複製業公會，配予各複製廠。本年一月一日起，因感聯合配銷制，收效不宏，乃予廢止。自本年一月一日起，改由本會按各廠存棉，收購其產紗之半數。尙餘半數，則歸各廠自由買賣。收購之半數棉紗，由本會委託紡建公司，按該公司原定辦法出售。本會對紡建公司營業辦法，向不過問。玆因五縣染織工業公會有所未明，特聲明如上。</p>
<p>紗布北運審核將竣</p>
<p>又該會辦理紗布輸往河北東北各口岸廠商資格審核事宜，今可吿一段落。一俟呈准吳兼主委後，即可核准家數一發表。至撤銷紗布輸往漢；辦法一事，此次該會業務處劉處長晋京時，曾與經濟部陳部長治商一過。陳部長表示可考慮改訂辦法，改由各業公會發證證明轉口云。</p>
<h3>紗布挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日紗市以銀根轉鬆，業外問津，染織廠乘機進取，客帮去胃亦佳，致市氣挺俏。四二支藍鳳紗最後高至一千三百萬元，比上日軋高二十萬元，廿支特雙馬爲八百六十五萬元，雙馬紗七百八十五萬元，均升廿五萬元。其餘三一支及二十支十六支等粗紗跟升一二十萬元不一。</p>
<p>棉布市况亦略形挺秀細布惟龍頭五福藍鷄彩球四牌軋小一二千元外，振中永字及王龍三牌軋升一萬元，士林布高檔一九〇雛鷄每疋猛漲三萬元，一統亦好萬元左右，色布斜紋及漂布嗶嘰府綢等，均趨堅硬，紡建公司開布三十種，價亦堅穩。</p>
<h3>浙區春繭豐收</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州五日電〕浙區今年春繭已吿豐收，全省四區，新嵊區杭州區即可結束，湖州區尙未上市，以嘉興區產數最旺，截至四日，各地收起總數已達七萬餘担，預計可能收足十萬担，各區已發貸款，計杭區四百五十億，嘉興五百億，新嵊三十餘億，湖州四十餘億，惟貸款不敷分配。現中蠶公司除已極力設法繼續貸款外，今已馳電四行，請求迅增貸款。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日電〕浙省春繭已成尾聲，若千繭行已陸續停秤，結果嘉區較遲，惟十日前當可全部結束。現貸款已耗一千一百餘億，惟嘉區各縣需款尙多已由省　急電京滬，以最速方式劃杭，因日前嘉興因繭款拖欠過多，　　　紛擾。</p>
<p>各地繭行全部開秤</p>
<p>農經兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，鑒於江蘇各地繭行，已於前日全部開秤。現値收繭旺季，爲明瞭當地實際情形及貸款狀况，該會主任委員譚熙鴻，常務委員湯錫祥，昨晨由京滬分別赴無錫，會同轉赴蘇州，吳江各重要產蠶區域，作普遍視察。預料行程，約以三天爲期。</p>
<h3>申請已合格者　儘先辦理配米</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配會會址尙在裝修中，在該會未成立前，一切事項暫由社會局糧食科辦理。本市工會學校配米，因由請者衆多，審査手續麻煩，辦事人員缺少，故一部份通知書雖已發出，至今尙未領得配米。</p>
<p>社會局吳局長因感辦事太慢，昨特下令糧食科，自即日起，對申請者停止審査，而儘先辦理審査已合格者之配米。吳氏因兼調配會主委，特召集該會常委張曉崧·任顯羣·葉寳甫·及糧食部上海糧食總倉庫主任葉新明，社會局糧食科長吉明齋等，於今日下午四時半，在社會局開會，商討調配會進行事宜。</p>
<p>食米平定雜糧疲挫</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千九百餘石，北市貨湧銷懈，粳秈米均見回跌三五千至萬元，白陰元提高殺次。南市早市依然喊緊，午時轉懈，結局相仿。秈米去化淸淡，略呈軟化，白陰元挺立，客元消化冷淡。</p>
<p>麫粉漲跌互見，洋粉回跌一二千元，廠粉亦小千餘元，惟下身統粉　園去　尙活，挺升一二千元。麩皮內地實銷轉動，微升千元。豆餅汕頭動辦，轉漲一二千元。油市連跌之後，店方乘巧納取，消化轉殷，形勢疲而復挺。</p>
<p>生油豆油回漲萬餘元，淸油菜油蔴油略見挺秀，暫成盤旋之格。赤豆胃呆不振，步削三五千元。菉豆最爲沉悶，猛跌萬元，紅糧去胃轉淡，狂落萬元。苞米靑島北洋天津均停辦，猛瀉二萬元。芝蔴供求兩稀，市形站局。</p>
<p>生仁趨勢平庸，黄豆逐步下降，再跌三五千元。新蠶豆來貨湧噻，供多求少，節節下游。高貨步削三五千元。中下猛挫萬元，小麥立定。</p>
<h3>捲菸市況續疲</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况疲憊，並傳中華公司續派「雙斧，全祿」，永泰和對外埠同行又有大量派配，每單位可派十四箱之多。十支大英步小至六百四十萬元，比上續跌七萬元，老刀五百四十九萬元，亦跌十六萬元。五華哈德門二姻脚地較堅，價回好二萬至十萬元，其餘華商姻及美貨條煙則互有升降。</p>
<h3>華股形勢轉好　臨收略露疲態</h3>
<p>華股昨以環境經前晚會議，似露曙光，人心轉俏。但因操之過激，俏後終難持久，臨收突吿怯疲。現遞掉期交易，昨永紗在三百元迄三八〇元間，信和在一三〇元至一七〇元間，小型股自六元半迄十一元，合息價自一角八至二角四不等。良以風波迭起，本屆存賬减少，以致套利較爲便宜也。</p>
<p>晨開即交各股已見穩健，永紗開高較多，遞永紗遂見俏俐。開後二號二二四號二二六號八五號二三一號二一八號二四號一八五號來進，一〇四號一八八號則力購現永紗，乃遞永紗不久即達漲停。暗市且喊高至七千元大關，麗安大通景綸中絲均吿漲停，一五七號一七七號七六號二三號趁高賣至六八〇〇元內，二二四號二二六號一九〇號一四八號七五號二八號二二號再進至六九〇〇元外。一五四號二〇〇號三六號二二三號一八〇號二一二號脫手，二〇一號亦賣即交，乃降至六七〇〇元內。七六號九九號二二號趁勢尙進，一一二號亦納即交永紗，於是遞永紗回升至六八七〇元。現永紗達六五〇〇元外，此後二〇二號雖不時吸納，九九號一七一號一二號一五二號一五三號一四二號以及散多陸續斬多，午刻浮多自相殘踏，遞永紗竟下挫至六五〇〇元低價。一一七號二〇四號等維持之下，新光急切回上，永紗亦稍見定，臨收以盤局結束。結果較之前收即交，計永紗中法微升，永公尙平，信和華豐新光景福勤興新華微降，中絲景綸漲停後有回，各升半成，大通漲停後有回，軋低半成，麗安漲停役有回，祇吿微升，新亞跌落一成，國貨中紡統益均平，內衣微挫，榮豐永泥商務微升。遞交各股計永紗漲停後有回，與永公同漲半成强，新光信和華豐景福勤興均吿微漲，塲外各老股僅五洲未見振作外，餘均回漲少許。</p>
<h3>統債初高後低外股交易仍少</h3>
<p>公債昨統丙初高後低，晨開一三八〇〇元。自一三九〇〇元起，盤低至一二九〇〇元，而後稍回，最後站定於一三〇〇〇元關，五五五室五五一室三六〇室有售，二〇八室五〇三室則進，結果較前收尙缺三百元。統戊最爲生色，獨漲五百元，甲乙升二百元，統丁祗升一百元，成交約六百餘萬。倍數還本又有渺望說，趨勢不定。</p>
<p>外股昨成交仍少，仍隨華股爲進退。散戶先進繼出，金業中人稍有吸收，但合盛有所脫售。怡紗晨開六七〇〇〇元，港申電報低至十四元七，高價見六八〇〇〇元。最後下挫至六五〇〇〇元低價結束。結果較前收計業廣怡啤航業鋼業墾植微漲，怡紗稍降，英聯會德豐紙業電話均平。</p>
<h3>人造絲市活躍　昨喊價直綫上升　廠經平靜交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲繼續高升，一二〇號高山有光上午開盤，仍喊上日最後價爲一千九百三十萬元，嗣因各方進胃甚好，喊價直綫上升，傾刻間即做到八十萬元有成交。午收盤竟冲出二千萬元關，下午因有乘高價擬脫手者，故喊價稍回，最後一千九百八十萬元爲賣出價，較上日仍漲起五十萬元。東洋牌子貨缺喊大十萬元，其餘各牌貨均隨之升降。</p>
<p>廠經昨日市况平靜，交易淸淡，只做開D字等級價二千四百五十萬至八十萬元幾檔，其他各級俱只有喊價而乏成交。因傳聞無錫鮮繭收價在一百二三十萬元之間，且繅折頗好，故各方均抱觀望態度，以致吸胃甚薄。</p>
<p>昨日綢貨市况頗形振奮，眞絲被面好起四五十萬元，大誠格子　縐大一千五百元，上午開市先做三萬五千二百元，經多方拉抬，最大喊到六千元，收市稍回，五千六百元有成交，隔日期做開六千元。人造絲貨市價平疲，因實銷淸淡，欲漲無力，華錦縐高檔昨做一萬七千元，盛杭等貨原盤未更。</p>
<h3>今秋我國原棉收成　估計可逾千萬擔　明年原料無需仰給外洋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國農業糧食組織執行委員鄒秉文，昨日接見記者，泛論我國棉產·菸葉·糧食諸事甚詳，茲摘誌大要如次：</p>
<p>原棉增產方面，去年十二月間，渠曾受行政院宋前院長之囑，籌劃全國棉產改進處原棉增產計劃，當承按照預定計劃，撥給該處全年經費九十八億元，故全部增產計劃得賴以推進。本年度下種之棉籽，計外國及我國之種籽各五百担，合共十萬担，分植全國各區。此中以湖北佔最多，陜西，河南，四川，浙江等次之。河北，山東，本為重要之植棉區，惜以戰事關係，工作發生陣礙</p>
<p>按照該項植棉計劃，本年九十月間，新棉登塲，估計可收原棉一千二百五十萬担。如依目前全國棉紡事業開足四百萬紗錠，每錠每年耗棉三担計算，則該項增產計劃完成，明年我國所需原料，已毌需仰給於外洋。惜國內各地戰事延續，且近來北方天旱，不無影響於計劃之完成。惟今年底之原棉產量，當可較上年之總產量七百萬担大大增加。同時，又可爲國家撙節大批外匯資金。現棉產改進處分支機構，普設全國各處。技術工作人員，多至四百人以上。預計明年度該處全年經費，將擴充至五百億元。</p>
<p>菸草增產方面，原定據點有三，即河南之許昌，山東之濰縣一帶，安徽門台子。目前山東因時局關係，安黴因地土關係，暫時只能集中於許昌增植菸葉。該地菸田，已自去年之四十萬畝，擴充至今年之七十萬畝。故今年菸葉之產量，當可較去年大量增加</p>
<p>糧食方面，渠認爲除向國外訂購洋米供應外，治本辦法，尙在增產。渠稱：我國戰前進口洋米，年在法幣二億以上。惟進口數額實僅佔我國產量百分之五。我國糧食不能增產，實由政府漠視農業所致。故爲今之計，仍應設法儘量增產，尤需顧到農民之生產成本云。</p>
<h3>江海關增訂　繫船浮筒租費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關頃揭示第一三七號公吿，略稱：査海關繫船浮筒租費，茲經呈准，自即日起，增訂如次：甲級浮筒（每日或未滿一日）國幣二十五萬元。丙級浮筒（每日或未滿一日）國幣十二萬元。再船舶在海關浮筒停泊超過原申請之期限者，其超過期間之租費，應照定額四倍徵收。又船舶在停泊海關浮筒期間，如　事修理，或有其他原因並不起卸貨物者，其租費亦按規定數目之四倍徵收。惟裝卸貨物而又同時從事修理之船舶，如修理工作未能於原准停聲時期內完成時，得申請延長停擊期限，其延長期間最初十日仍按定額收費，自第十一日起則按定額四倍收費。</p>
<h3>中信避標售　菩躉額陳茶一批</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據記者向茶業界探悉：中央信託局於昨日開始標賣之躉額外銷陳茶，由培豐·汪裕泰·午昌等出口行標進數百箱，計陳特貢侮擔以十七萬至卅五萬元標開，陳珍眉每擔爲卅五萬一千元。聞此次標售之陳茶。貨品尙佳，較市上至少便宜七折光景。又悉：尙有相當數是之內銷茶，中信局擬於下次公閉標售，其品質亦屬不惡。</p>
<h3>南京路商聯會　擁護簡化稽征</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市南京路商聯會，為抗議所利得稅査賬佔定，擁護市參議會簡化稽征，昨特發表宣言，略謂：査賬估定，僅堪適用於民生穩定之時，不堪嘗試於百業困窮之今日。我工商所爭，乃指目前査賬辦法之必不可行，非關資本如何而足勝宰割。以資本言，賬面數字愈增，實際物資愈少，所虧者實，所盈者虛，原有資本較多，虧且較巨。本會對市參議會議決之簡化稽征辦法，竭誠致其擁護云云。</p>
<h3>顧善昌晉京　傳達經紀人意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所經紀人公會，日前會議所決定之認購美金債券意見，業於昨日由該公會負責人，與證交當局口頭洽談一過。茲悉：證交協現顧善昌，已奉派於昨晚晋京，同行尙有財經兩部駐證交監理官王　堂吳公魯兩人。聞顧民此次晋京，除將向財經兩部傳達經紀人方面之意見外，尙搗有申請上市股票四種，呈部核定，俾便上市開拍。據悉：目前申請上市股票，共有四十八種。經證交上市證券審査委員俊審査認可者，目前尙僅四種云。</p>
<h3>出售國營事業　國行作初步商談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行張總裁，於昨日下午四時，在該行召集王　　，吳蘊初，李馥蓀，傅汝霖諸氏談話，迄六時許始散。聞會談內容，與如何加速出售國營生毒事業及敵僞產業有關。交換意見結果，將由張氏提交下週間召開之全國經委會議席上討論云。</p>

<h3>都市建設地方自治</h3>
<p>— 趙祖</p>
<p>——介縵「鄰里單元」設計這意義——</p>
<p>上海的都市計劃工作，一年餘來，經上海市政府的郡市計劃委員會與工務局積極推進，最近已將計劃「總圖」送請市參談會審核，再過幾例月，遺大上海的計劃定案，當可完成他技術設計的程序，而進入行政核定與實際施行的階段。</p>
<p>在此六月六日工程師紀念節，我想不揣　陋把「都市計劃」這名稱中所包含的「都市建設」的意義，和他對於「地方自治」的關係及可能的影響，略略談談，以祝頌我們中國工程師今後建國工作中一個艱鉅部門——即都市計劃的　利進行與成功。</p>
<p>都市建設以自然建設為基礎</p>
<p>一個國家有他各個主要方面的建設，如經濟建設，政治建設，軍事建設等等，一個都市亦然。他可以分成三個方面：一，經濟建設，二，社會建設，三自然建設，（Physical　Development）都市計劃的對象，便是自然魏設，不過計劃的人，乃是要從自然建設的有計劃的發展，產生他對於經濟建設和社會建設的力量，這可說是我們工程師的一種宏願。</p>
<p>舉一個例：假如上海都市計劃中，經過整個的詳細的調查研究與正反兩方面的辨難討論，決定亦計劃「總圖」裏，包括有浦江大橋或隧道，而由此總圖的決定，加强主張越江工程者的信心興努力，結果呢，竟能在數年紋在計劃所規定的年限內建築完成了，那他對於浦東浦西的其他自然建設及整個上海的經濟建設與社會建設，將產生一種何等有效的力量，是可以預料得到的，是以都市建設，雖有社會的，經濟的，自然的三方面，但一般人及學工程的人，都將都市建設着眼並着力於自然建設的一方面，好比講一個國家的經濟計劃時，其重點每每集中於工業建設，交通建設，農業建設等一樣。</p>
<p>一個都市的自然建設，可說是道都市的社會建設，經濟建設的基礎，而「都市建設」應當着眼並着力於自然建設方面，這是在「六六」祀念日我們工程師對於都市建設的認識與解釋。</p>
<p>地方自治要有新的保甲組織</p>
<p>都市建設與地方自治，究竟有何關聯呢？其關聯即在上邊所關述的都市之自然建殷與社會經濟建設相互影響這一點上，地方自治，在都市看，不啻即是都市的政治的或社會的建設。地方自治最要的一點，在乎一個地方的人民，能够自已選舉地方的官吏，來管理自已的事，能够自已辦理警察，來保障自己的生命財產之安全。照我們現行地方自治制度，則有鄉鎭保甲戶等的纖織，惟其有此組織，各種地方自治設施乃可推行，而要得到此種組織的構成與健全，以及此種組織與各種設施能配合，則都市計劃將是最有力量最合理的方法。</p>
<p>近代都市計劃的重要原則之一，便是「鄰里單元」（Neiggbourhood　Unit）的剙立。鄰里單元，可說是新的保甲組織。何謂「鄰里單元」？近代都市計劃者把都市看作一個有機體，希望道都市不論在自然的意養或社會的意義上都能鄉村化，於是有鄰里單元的設計。我們看到上海的市民，即使住在同一里弄，甚至貼鄰的，每每彼此不通姓名，不相聞問，但在二千數百年前的孔子，却很有意義地說渦：「里仁為美。」又說：「德不孤，必有鄰。」而今日的上海，今日的不少世界都市，偏偏不如此，結果呢？都市裏的人，離了家，只是工廠，「寫字間，」商店，俱樂部，娛樂塲等等，而喪失了鄰里交誼的友情與社團生活，於是都市的精神生活，似乎只有了競爭，奪取，或是痛苦，嫉恨，或是放縱的淫靡，享樂，這是近代都市文明的最大損失。鄰里單元，便是來補償這個損失的。</p>
<p>隣里單元之意義</p>
<p>現在看看上海都市計劃總圖二稿報告書中關於鄰里單元的構成的設計。</p>
<p>報告書中，許劃未來的上海市，要分為十二個區單元，（原又稱市區單位，）區單元之下，有「鎭單元」，（原文稱市鎭單位，）各　單地之間，有錄地帶（Green　Belt）把他們分開的。他有高　中學，醫院，敎堂，警察局，郵政局等。鐵單元之下，有「社團單元，」（原文稱中級單位，）社團單元，是由所謂「補助幹道」環繞而成的，其中應有初級中學一所及翳院，警察派出所等。社團單元之下，則有「鄰里單元，」（原文稱小單以。）</p>
<p>每個鄰里單元須有小學一所，每個完全小學有六個年級，每級設雙班，每班四十人，全校可有學生四百八十名。以上海情形論，小學適齡兒童，占人口分之十二，計足修四千人口入學子弟之需要。這是上海都市計劃的最小設計組織，除了小學校外，他要有公共圖書館，幼稚園，托兒所，運動塲，兒童遊戲塲及商店中心等。</p>
<p>自鄰里單元，社團單元，鎭單元以至區單元，除了上述具有各種設備的有機體性的設計規定外，尙有土地使用，位置　關於步行距離時間上之配合如下：</p>
<p>一，鄰里單元內，自住宅至日用品商店的步行時間，應不超過十分鐘。</p>
<p>二，鄰里單元內，小學生自住宅至學校的步行時間，景多為十五分鐘。</p>
<p>三，住宅到工作地點之路程，减低到三十分鐘的步行距離</p>
<p>四，娛樂地區與住宅須在不超過三十分鐘步行時間的距離以內。</p>
<p>五，自住家到經常的行政機關，應不超過四十五分鐘的步行距離。</p>
<p>由上所說，可見宋來的上海都市，如照都市計劃者的理想實行，將是一個配置很經濟很和　很有生命的有機體，而其基層組織在乎「鄰里單元」。</p>
<p>這種鄰里單元，在形式上看來，好像我國地力自治制度裏在縣市區鄉鎭之下，設有保與甲，（上文所稱新的保甲組織，）但是保甲組織是沿襲以往傳統的社會組織加以修改而成，在自然發展的基礎上，似乎已經央去了他的意義與作用，則如上文所說，以上海里弄而論，將一個里弄內數十戶人口組織為若干保，若干甲，但是他們還是不粗知名，不相往來的，各戶分別的生活着，如何能發生社會的自治的作用呢？何　在此房租不正常，房東不過問，公德低落之情形下，上海私人里弄內之垃圾與灣渠道路等淸潔修理問題之無法得到合理的解決了。</p>
<p>反之，鄰里單元却將一個單元中四千左右人口用房屋地位的設計，交通系統的設計，公共塲所如學校衛生所公共會塲等的設計，種種配合起來，使得確確成為一個極親密的近鄰，同里的有社會生活的團體，那時候你要他們選舉，要他們共同警衛，共同防疫，共同舉辦淸理垃圾修理這路溝渠，共同發展或改良小學敎育等等，將何等的便利而有效。這是鄰里單元的作用。</p>
<p>推而廣之，社團單元，鎭單元，區單元，也都可發揮他們各自的個性與作用。地方自治得此，便可舉重若輕的成功了。這是在今天工程師節中，我們工程師對於地方自治推進前途主張新關一條途徑的建醫。</p>
<p>我很希望：上海的工程師們，上海辦理地方自治的人們，—民政處及各區的人員，以及上海的熱心社會人士，和全體市民，都能確認都市建設與地方自治都要從都市計劃做起，而我國的新都市計劃，要能推行「鄰里單元」之組織與建設，要能將自治組織與都市計劃裏的都市之各層自然組織配合起來，這不但是地方自然建設，這也是社會改革，這是地方自治先決的自然條件，這是民主的然礎，這是全中國的事，這是我們工程師的宏願與責任。（三十六年六月一日稿）</p>
<h3>我國造船工程展望</h3>
<p>— 徐學禹</p>
<p>我國造船工程，一向未為世人所重視；與我國其他各工程部門相較，造船工程可稱是冷靜，最不受人注意的。</p>
<p>抗戰以前，我國治江沿海船舶，共計一百廿餘萬噸。其中六十餘萬噸為國藉船舶。因受外商經濟上的侵略，不平等條約的束神，以及我國航政法規不健全的影響，國籍船舶，大多是逾齡已久，陳腐不堪，航商們勉强度日，已是不易；當然無法添補新船。即使有，也是極少數。故其時我國造船工業，極為淸淡；同時也不健全，不受人注意，自為當然結果。</p>
<p>勝利以後，航權收回，復員期間，頓感船隻缺乏。於是各航業機構，為爭取時間計，向國外訂購大批船隻，至目前為止，我國現有船舶，已達七十萬噸。是項船舶的來源，大多為國外舊船，或為戰後剩餘船舶，在勝利後船隻缺乏的時候，當然可以暫時利用，以維水運。可是這類船舶若非噸位過大，即覺吃水太深。修理及維持費用，極為龐大，不僅對於我國港埠情形，大多不甚適宜；且極不經濟，絕對不能與外商相競爭。這種事實所推演的結論是：我們要獲得適合於本國港埠情形的船隻，或是我們要開闢外洋綫與外商競爭，我們非新造船隻不可。</p>
<p>同時，戰前我國沿江沿海的船舶一百廿餘噸，日本那時的沿舶總噸立約為五百萬噸假使我們在補滿以前沿江沿海噸位外，再代替日本戰前一部份的航運事業，則我國至少需要二百五十萬噸的商船，若每艘商船之規定年齡為廿五年，則我國每年至少須建造十萬噸新船，來陸　補充，方可維持這二百五十萬必需的噸位，對於軍艦漁船等特種師船之建造，尙不計在內。</p>
<p>所以此後迭船工程，極有逐漸發達的希望和需要。同時確為政府當局所注意，眲近資委會籌設中央造船廠，江南造船所之逐漸擴充設備，以及交通部擬籌辦船舶修造廠等，即為其例。</p>
<p>可是造船工業之建設，有幾個必要條件，必須逐步使其實現及改進，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>航政法規之制定</p>
<p>航政，法規對於新船設計的關係最大各國在其航政法規中。對於船舶各部份的構造，船舶防水防火的設備，船舶乾舷，鍋爐主機及副機，以及船員，房間及各故客位大小等均有很詳密的規定。換言之，航政法規，也可視為船舶構造及設備的標準。國際間也會會議多次，規定了國際航綫上各種船舶的安全標準及乾舷條例等，可是各國因其特殊情形，尙各有其特殊的規定。如美國有大湖及內河船舶的規定，日本有內海船舶的規定，英國有各殖民地移民船等的規定，蘇　士與巴拿馬運河以及其他各國政府，均各有其規定。我國航政法規，可稱毫無基礎，連最起碼的乾舷定律，都無規定。甚至有關船舶的各項名詞，亦漫無標準。所以我國的造船工程界，應從速協助政府制定很完善的航政法規。非僅我國以後的新船，可以依照一定標準去設計，而且我國航業界，也可以根機這標準去保養去維特他們的船舶安全和効能，這不僅是造船工程所念需，而且為航業前途計，實亦為必要且迫切的措施。</p>
<p>船模試驗池之設置</p>
<p>船用燃料之節省，大半　於船型及推進器之改良。關於船型及惟進器的研究可說是近廿年內造船工程最重要的發展。是項研究，全　船模試騐池。仳界各國如英美法蘇德日意荷奧西挪瑞等都有船模試騐池的設置，各國大學中亦往往均備有船模試騐池，以供實騐。對於各權船型之正確馬力，以及船型之改良與增加推進器効能等等，都須於試騐池中決定。我國沿江沿海水流的情形，有其特性，去配合這種水流的特性，亦應用特殊的船型和推進器，而其產生，必須有賴於試騐池。故我國若要建造新型的船舶，使其在特殊的航綫中，發揮其最高的効能，就必須建立一設備完善的船模試騐池，來詳細研討。同時設計新船，若欲確定其馬力，也非船模試騐池不可。</p>
<p>造機技術之改進</p>
<p>造船與造機，兩者唇齒相依，必須相輔而行，才能建造良好的船舶。我國對於普通的烟管或水管鍋爐以及通常的往復蒸汽機及半提士爾式柴油機，抗戰前即可製造。但其効能，都極平凡。若高汽壓鍋爐，高壓及低壓汽　機，新型蒸汽機高速柴油機及電動推進等較新頴較準確的機器，國內迄無工廠可惟製造，這是我國造船工程最大的缺點。當然造機的技術，與一般機器工業的改進，有密切的關係。同時鋼　冶鍊的技術，也發生很大的影響。關於這點，必須造船造機及冶鍊各方而的工程專家，大家一致努力，來建立船機工業，方可使造機的技術逐漸改進，以配合我們新建船舶的需要。</p>
<p>輔機工業之建立</p>
<p>船用輔機，種類繁多，不勝枚舉，通常造船廠中，並不全部製造。而另有各種專門工廠，統稱為輔機工業，如舵機·傳令鐘·起錨車·給水泵·循環泵·空氣泉·發電機·冷氣機以及錨·錨鏈·鋼絲系繩索等等，均可分別設廠專門制造。將來我國造船工業逐漸發達，是項輔機工業，勢必應運而生。政府方面，自願多多扶助，以期整個造船工業，可以全部雄立。</p>
<p>以上諸點，均為發展我國造船工業的必要條件，所以我特別提出，希望造船工程界多多注意，多多努力，使我國以後所需的船舶，都能由本國製造，都能發揮其特殊的効能，都能在國際航綫上與人家並駕齊驅，同時亦希望政府與航業界，多多予造船工程界協助，儘速建樹我國的造船寧業，以改進我們船隻的性能，才能眞正發展我國的航業。</p>
<h3>交通大學　為電信建設而創辦之：電信管理系</h3>
<p>— 郁秉堅</p>
<p>電信交通之於國家，猶人體之神經系統，凡電路之修短，機械之良竄，足為推測國力盛衰之準則，無論在國防上，經濟上，政治上，工業上，均佔有極重要地位。我國自前淸光緒五年（公元一八七九年）開始自辦電報，迄今已六十餘年，電話之創設，雖峧後於電報，但亦有四十餘年之歷史，全國報話局，據戰前統計，有千餘所，綫路達十餘萬里，乃以對日抗戰發生，東南半壁淪於敵手，電信交通，備遭摧殘，迨日寇屆膝，各大都市之電氣通信，已漸次恢復，然欲求配合時代需要，完成建國使命，則目前之電信事業，固猶徘繼續努力，茲就觀感所及，將改進一我國電信之希望，略述於下：</p>
<p>（一）有綫電報　有綫電報，在今日我國電信界中，仍佔相當地位，唯路綫受戰事之摧殘，損毀頗多，亟待修復，同時應增加綫條，重要廻路，宜改用銅綫，利用幻象及載波裝置，多用自動機械，并逐漸發展傳眞電報，打字電報。京滬宜改設地下電纜，至沿海各重要城鎭，尤宜沉佈水綫，以固國防，而保通訊之秘密。</p>
<p>（二）無綫電報　電信建設初期，宜充分利用無綫以補綫路建設之不足，多闢直達路綫，尤重邊疆通訊，凡業務較繁之局，最少限度，宜用一啟羅華特以上之發射機，以减少通訊時之衰落與千擾。</p>
<p>（三）有綫電話　有綫電話，為建設國內通訊網之　本，敷設綫路，改善機件，自應同時并進，凡　通都大邑，宜一律改用自動話機，并宜儘量利用載波設備，藉以提高長途電話傳遞效率，至地位偏僻之鄉鎭，為流通商情，守望相助計，更應添設電話，初步採用共電式或磁石式機件亦無不可，務使隨時隨地現都市取得聯絡。</p>
<p>（四）無綫電話　凡國際間以及國內距離較遠之各大都市暨桿設綫，工程艱鉅，普設無綫電話以通消息，實為目下之要務。</p>
<p>以上僅就改善電信設備方面，舉其犖犖大者，至如何發展我國電信事業，使之蒸蒸日上，其重心在於整個電信技術與管理是否健全，如僅有電信按術，而無健全之管理方法，將無以統率所屬，順利推進，所有電信主管人員自不能拘拘於每一技術之專長，某一學識之優良，而沽沽自喜，必待嫻熟「電信技術與管理」，或簡稱「電信管理」始能綢舉而目張，勝任而愉快，所謂「電信管理」者，並非即以技術人員，擔任行政管理之謂，其性質為技術與管理，互為體用，至少限度，須對技術有深切之研究，對行政管理，有相當之認識也。近聞美國人士，對於各種事業之管理財務與營業，極為在重，已有與工程技術，並駕齊騙之勢。</p>
<p>交通大學五十年來，以培植各種事業之技術與管理人材為目的，所有工學院，理學院與管理學院，均各有專長，歷年人才輩出；貢獻於社會國家者甚夥。前年交通部以我國電信建設事業，日漸擴充，除需訓練大批技術人員，以應調度外，對於「電信管理」人材之需要，更見迫切，爰添設「電信管理」一系，以期技術與行政，兼顧並重，不致使熟練技衛者，對於行政，漢然無知，一旦充任主管，常有不能應付裕如之感，一方面固可謂適應目前電信界之需要，另一方面，亦可謂融合該校工管兩院之電信技術與管理課程於一爐，以補過去之不足，電信管理系一年級學生入級試騐，以工管兩學院為標準，注重國文，英文，欺學，理化，並須具有管理興趣與能力者，俾入學前於　本各科，已具相當根底，而攻習高深之技術與管理，易求進步，入學後之課程，經交通部電信總局與交通大學各派專家手訂，計：</p>
<p>一年級</p>
<p>國文，英文，微積分，力學，熱學，聲學，光學，磁電學，經濟地理，簿記及會計，經濟學原理，法學通論，機械實。</p>
<p>二年級</p>
<p>英文，第二外國語，微分方程，電機工程，電信大意，熟力工程內燃機學，蓄電池學，理財數學，企業紙織與理財，高級會計，物理實騐，工程實習。</p>
<p>三年級</p>
<p>電報學，電話工程，綫路工程，電信傳轍，工程電子學，中外電信史，成本會計與討價原理，電信會計，工商與人事管理，材料管理，商法，電工實騐，暑期實習。</p>
<p>四年級</p>
<p>無綫電工程，載彼需信，電信濾波器與網路，電傳眞蹟，超短波學，說計學，經濟政策，財務報告分析，電信法規與業務處理，中外電信制度，電信實騐，論文。</p>
<p>該系創設伊始，暫由秉堅担任系主任，時感課程　訂，容未盡善，當視實際情形之需要，隨時修正，並祈賢達先進，示我周行，以匡不逮，則幸甚矣。</p>

<p>我國之有工程師節，自民國卅年始。其時後方各地，因抗職關係，對外交通隔絕，物資缺乏，朝野上下莫不以建設工業努力生產為唯一要圖。工程師之職務遂為一般人之所重說，工程師之地位與聲譽，更如旭日之升，蒸蒸日上，就工程師本　言，亦知努力警發，埋頭苦幹，凡戰前不敢嘗試之重大工程，必須　才國外者，我工程師能肩負重任輕快完成，凡戰前國內無法製造之物品，一般廠家不敢輕於製造者，我工程師能於萬分　苦環境中，每方研尤設法仿製以濟當時之急用。凡工礦，交通，事業日常必要之器材物料，在戰前完全仰給舶來，當時因設備關係，無法製造者，我工程師亦能於無可如何中，寧覓各種代魯品，以資應付，八年抗戰貢獻殊多，自廿七年起，連年於重慶，民明，成都，貴陽，蘭州，桂林等地，舉行年會，各地方政府以及社會人士爭相歡迎，熱烈招待，於大會之中，將當地迫切急要工程問題提付討論，於以見國人對於工程師　望之殷，信託之重，將來大規模建設工作開始，百廢俱舉，千鈞重擔，皆在吾儕之　肩，謹於本屆工程師節日，貢獻　蕘如次：</p>
<p>總裁中國之命運，及工業建設計劃內，皆列有將來需要技術人員之數額，然國內究有技術人員若干？各公私機關團體而無確切統計，抗戰以前，資源委員會曾經普遍調查，不過一萬餘人，戰前實業部戰時經濟部，所辦技師登記，總計僅數千人。戰時中央設計局曾舉辦調查，然未聞有統計數字發表。卅二年敎曾部曾根據大學工科，及中等職業學校畢業人數作一統計，高級者，約二萬人，中級者約五六萬人，但留學生，及各工廠自行訓練之技術人員，並未計及，將來建設開始，需用人才自多，必須訓練培植以補不足，然我國已有之人員，共有若干？分門別類各有若干？幾人從事私人事業？幾人服務政府機關？幾人業已改業？幾人尙在賦閒？我人之智慧，並不　後，端賴利用得宜，為未雨綢　計，似宜由政府機關，私人團體通力合作，普遍調查，毋使缺漏以為國家之參考，我工程師同仁，亦宜力謀配合。凡有調查表件，即便照實塡寄，倘或視為無足重輕，而置之不理，則此項工作仍難期其有成。</p>
<p>我工程人員之工作領域，概括言之不外交通事業，工談事業，政府機關，敎育機關，以及為社會服務之開業技師，以上各類以後者為絕對少數，且可斷　在此少數人員中，以土木建築兩科為最多，機械電織化工紡織等科，均屬無幾，方者英美諸國，相去誠不可以道里計。　其原因，係社會人士之未予重視亦抑我儕本身努力之不足。將來公私建設同時並舉，工　事業，突飛猛晋，舉凡新廠之建設，管理方法之改進，生產效率之提高，以及工程難題之解決等，必將紛至沓來，自行開業之顧問工程師，勢必有大量之需要，又專利法早由政府明令公布，不久即將付素實施，為發明人服務之代理人，各地律師及會計師固將分任其事，然我工程師亦為其中不可缺少之一員，證以英美諸國，發明專利案件之多，事務必甚繁劇，此苦我儕將來服務之園地，甚　共同注意及之。</p>
<p>我工程師學會成立已卅餘年，具有卓越之成演與夫悠久之歷史，然政府機關恒以學術團體視之舉凡各級民意機關之潠舉，均少參加之機會，我工程師同人亦當以此為憾事，然細加研究，癥結所在，不難明暸，律師為保障人權而服務，政府乃有律師法之訂立，會計師為稽核資產盈虧而服務，政府乃有會計師法之頒行，我工程師服務社會，影響所至，小則及私人資產，大則及於公共安全，其關係不可為不重，徒以未立專法，以保障其合法地位，致不為人所重視，再按技師之開業程序，先向考試院考選委員會申請檢　檢　及格，再向經濟部領取登記證外，最後向當地主管機關申請開業，所謂檢　僅係資格之審查，所謂登記，亦僅僅頒發證書，對於技師之服務，方式，責任，權利，義務等等，管無明文規定，經濟部對此早經見及，筆者亦會多方搜集參攷資料，準備試行起草，惜以輾轉遷延，愧無成就，為我工程前途利益計，似不能不及早圖之，深望我工程師同仁共策進行，擬議意見，提供主管機關之參攷。</p>
<p>以上所述，為筆者一時感念所及，不敢陳義過高，僅舉吾儕切身應有之努力，表而出之，以就敎於高明！</p>
<h3>我國工和師這當前責任</h3>
<p>— 周茲緒</p>
<p>自從一八四二年雅片戰爭以後，由國原來由小農業與家庭手工業所結合而成的經濟形態，已逐漸破壞以至於崩潰。到了一八六五年至一八七〇年之問，上海江南機器製造局，福州造船廠和天津機器製造局相繼設立，更促使我國經濟建設事業轉　到一個新的局面。就在這時候，工程師這三個字也開始給社會以一個嶄新的印象。</p>
<p>工程師的定義</p>
<p>可是在「形而上者謂之道形而下者謂之器」的傳統觀念之下，一般都認為工程師僅僅是較精進的機器匠而已。另一種不正確的看法，認為工程師在技術上僅僅是墨守西洋人的成法來裝置機器，運用機器，修理機器，在意義上，認為工程師僅僅是資本家一種必需的工具而已。這種看法雖則把工程師的重要性提高了不少，可是，同時對於工程師也可以說是一稱並不輕微的侮辱。</p>
<p>歐美人最初對於這名詞的印象，與我國也頗規似英語大字典中，對於工程師一辭所下的定義也不過是製圖設計者，監造或運用靜能態或動態之機器者而已。實在這些定義都不能包涵工程師一詞所應有的意義。所謂工程師的定義應該是「具有依據科學原理，以指揮進步及控制方法之實施之能力者」。</p>
<p>在這一次世界大戰的渦程中，各國由於原料的缺乏，工具的限制，產業界為了生產的關係，在各種客觀條件不旦備的環境中，要想打破其困難，工程師的地位，狠急速的提高。戰事結束之後，因為復員與復興工作之必要，工程師就益感需要。所以今日之工程師，不容氣的說，是不無有些優越感的。而如何去發揮這優越感，這在工程師本身應有其自覺性，在社會亦應有其普遍的再認識。這正是本文所特別提出而希望大家來共同商討的。</p>
<p>這一次我國抗戰勝利的結果，一方面固然證明了我國固有文化在民族道德上的成就，但一方面又證明了現代科學不可磨滅的輝煌効力。科學的實効組織，不僅可運用於自然物質上，而且可施之於社會秩序上，還就是西方文明的結晶，而為現代中國所迫切需要的。我國工程師，應該作為負起這一副擔子的前哨，將觸角深入於復興事業量重要的部門—生產界中，而發揮其運用。</p>
<p>為了達成這主要的任務，為了符合工程師的定義，其應行之步驟，實應加以考慮。現在把他分成團體與個人兩方面來說。</p>
<p>工程師團體組</p>
<p>關於團體方面，在理論上，當然團體的力量大於個人。工程師應打破我國傳統的思想，集合起來，組織起來，一方面擴大徽求，一方面嚴格甄別，這是當前所必需做的。</p>
<p>有了內涵充實而純粹的團體，然後能發揮團體的力量而達到其預定的任務。還有一個重要的因子，就是加緊團結。在重視個人超過團體的我國，多數人不大喜歡參加團體活動。他們以為這是多餘的，有間的，甚至認為道是為了某一個人的成功，而犧性了自己的。此外還有一個錯誤的見解，縱或在參加團體活動之後，也往往存在傳統的派別，與地域觀念。工程師旣然負有把科學的實效組織，施之於社會秩序的靑任，那末第一步必須把自己的組織健全化。</p>
<p>工程師的團體必須有一個信條。這信條就是工程師的定義——「具有議據科學原理以指揮進步及控制方法之實施之能力者」——的充份的實現。超時間超空間超黨派的永生。</p>
<p>其次根據道信條，團體就可以代替各個份子，而甲明其立塲。工程師在處理他的業務時，其性質是雙重的。一方面替廠方在生產的質量上謀取高度的進展；一方面替勞工在工作的過程上，謀取各方面的便利與安全。因此工程師的立塲，在勞資間是絕對中立的這應該有申明的必要。</p>
<p>以上五點，擴大組織，嚴格甄別，加强團結，宣布信條，申明立塲——皆是關於國體方面的。下面要談到個人方面的。責任問題，因　幅所限，容俟於續篇中詳述之。</p>

<h3>最近英國的劇壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>去年五月間美國有一羣人到倫敦新劇院（New　Theatre）去觀光，最近該劇院的阿里維爾（Laurence　Olivier）剛到美國去。美國這一羣演劇隊在倫敦上演魏爾德耐（Thornton　Wilder）的「我們的鎭」（OurTown）。這是一個優良的演劇隊，但賣座却平平。失敗的原因與編劇和演員無關，最重要的就是今日英國的趣味與從前不同了。例如魏爾德爾所寫的是生存，繁殖和死亡。他假借康勒爾斯鎭（Grovers　Corners上的人作哲學的沉思。像這樣的想像，戰後英國出版界是從來沒有的。英國現今不注重這類的人生問題。歐洲現正面臨着許多難解決的問題，還不能作玄學的夢想。彷彿有一個鐵幕，防止思想的東方化。哲學已不時髦，一般英國人所喜歡的是訴之與眼與耳的。英國觀衆總以爲從最富的美國來的演劇隊，佈景應該富麗堂皇，不料所看見的還只是幾張桌椅和洋傘，自然要大失所望。這結論是愚蠢的，恐怕是預先的成見所造的吧？</p>
<p>倫敦所演就大不相同。最大的成功是浪漫的古劇，以服裝和色彩取勝。除了老維克（Old　Vic），阿里維爾以及李査德生（Richardson）演莎士比亞的歷史劇以外，差不多都是玩弄服裝的色彩。最美麗的服裝上的成功就是王爾德「少奶奶的扇子」的上演。此外，觀衆還喜歡語方的色彩和音樂性，例如詩劇「到墳墓之路」（The　Way　to　the　Tomb）。</p>
<p>魏爾斯（Dadlers　Wells）劇院在一九四五年八月重新復活了，時常上演英國的舞踊劇。這劇院是一七六〇年建造的。去年二月間，珂凡特園（Coveut　Garden）劇院也重新開了起來，這也是一件可紀念的事。這所皇家歌劇院戰時曾改爲軍隊中人的跳舞廳，幸虧還不曾被敵人所破壞。紅絨座椅和粉紅燈罩仍舊是完好的。休息時在大樓梯上散步，使人有和平開始的暫時幻想。</p>
<p>這兩個歌劇院可說是塲塲客滿。倫敦人士極歡迎巴黎，美國和爪哇的歌劇和舞蹈去上演。</p>
<p>不久的將來，大約就要感覺到莎士比亞的歷史劇和「睡美人」的美麗是不適當的了吧？</p>

<h3>石榴花這戀</h3>
<p>— 姚妤</p>
<p>五月，石榴花紅遍了江南。</p>
<p>時間靜悄悄地過去，時代的輪子不斷地轉着，我，一個生活在無聲無色的日子裏的孩子，怎能不爲這殷紅之火而歡呼呢！？</p>
<p>在黑夜，我需要一盞燈來照耀我。在嚴冬，我需要一團火來溫暖我。在深秋，我需要一片機葉來陪伴我。然而在我靈魂的深處啊！我更需要一支生命的火炬</p>
<p>要生活有意義，就得戰鬥！不能了解戰鬥的意義，也就永遠不能了解生命的意義。</p>
<p>烈士長眠了。耶穌被釘在十字架上死了。但時間不會冲淡人類的記憶，殉難者所灑的熱血在千萬人的心坎中永遠是鮮明的。「竊火種」雖則是神話，然而普洛米修士的精神却爲世人永恒崇拜和歌頌。</p>
<p>於是，我愛「火」，我愛「血」我愛有着火和血一般顏色的「石榴花」。</p>
<p>我十分留戀於石榴花呵！爲了「生活」，爲了「生命」。……</p>
<p>石榴花—一頁用血寫成的詩篇，一面用火構成的旂幟，一支屬於年靑者的歌曲。</p>
<p>我記得很淸楚，是那年牆外石榴花燒紅了天空的時候，我第一次離鄉背井投向遠方了。……</p>
<p>郁李·蔦蘿　玞石</p>
<p>當憶念的白色的小花朶凋落的時節，我正戀於園中的一架郁李。</p>
<p>有些月夜曾經徘徊於花間，數天空的星星而馳想；或許是編一個近於緋紅的夢吧，那時我正寄情愛於隔園樓頭的帔霞娜。有誰家少女挑撥這鬱悒的離曲，訴無限幽怨於這漫長的良夜？於是我尋求溟　中的伊人，相思如落花之委於泥土。</p>
<p>彷彿離落難的郁李顫抖，揮斷我思念的游絲，搗碎了明月的夢；我乃黯然入室，安排我的夜之行程，自思已是中年了呵！</p>
<p>但，不，我仍是味然於自己的靑春，付年華於無情的流水而已……</p>
<p>該是蔦蘿爬上小木窗的季候了，而這裏却無綠色的行列，於是我懷念故鄕的廢園。</p>
<p>春天，它們爬出黑色的沃土；而長夏，它們爬上了小木窗，窺伺着我的書桌，偸吻我桌上的小水盂。</p>
<p>我珍重的記取着它們，惦念着那些載着露珠的枝蔓來探望我的一片慇戁。它們碧綠的長成於牆脚，點綴了醜陋的土牆的色彩，直到滿園秋風。</p>
<p>而今，故鄉的廢園荒了。小木窗失其所在，蔦蘿呢？更讓　息湮埋了昔日的戀念。</p>
<h3>薔薇</h3>
<p>— 儲品良</p>
<p>淸晨，秀妹從田園裏採回來了幾朶薔薇。薔薇的花色是紫紅的，十分鮮艷。</p>
<p>她把牠們投揷在寫字檯上的一個花瓶裏。同時，她又在那裏取出了一朶送給我。</p>
<p>我是樂於接受的，就伸手去取了，但手又立刻縮了回來，皺着眉頭呌痛。而秀妹在旁邊，却只是格格地發笑，說：</p>
<p>「大哥，這薔薇是有刺的。」</p>
<p>我很不高興地想責備她。</p>
<p>「這是不能怪我的！」</p>
<p>是的，刺是刺在我的手上怪別人有什麼用處呢。</p>
<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>仁和郁永河所撰「採　日記」一種，係于役臺灣所記；蓋臺灣之鷄籠，淡水，均產石硫磺。是書除日誌採硫而外，於全台山川·夷險·形勢·扼塞·番俗民情，紀之特詳，實眞魯亮儕「台灣始末偶記」，藍鹿洲「平臺紀略」等書，同爲有用之作。書中載詩頗多，茲錄其詠土番者數絕於此。「文身舊俗是雕靑，背上盤旋島　形，一變又爲文豹　，蛇神牛鬼共猙獰」。「胸背爛斑直到腰，爭誇錯錦勝鮫綃，冰肌玉腕都文遍，只有雙蛾不解描」。「覆額齊眉繞亂莎，不分男女似頭陀，晚來女伴臨溪浴，一隊　　蕩綠波。」「老翁似女女如男，男女無分總一般，口角有髭皆拔盡，鬚眉都作婦人顏。」</p>
<p>元季古愚胡助，自號純白老人，所作詩精縝華潤，而典雅雍容，又絕無綺靡浮薄之態。其松柏歲寒岡歌，起句云：「畫師不畫洛花妖艷萬枝紅，却畫峨眉嶺上長松；」又「不畫孤山横斜千點白，却畫孔明廟前一古柏，」詩　雄厚，直類唐人手筆。吳澄題「古愚詩　」云：「如春闌茁芽，夏竹含　，露滋雨洗之餘，馥馥幽媚，娟娟靜好」，五七言古近體皆然，洵非虛語。古愚手輯「純白齋類稿」，以薦經兵賽，卷册散佚，今所存者，乃其六世孫淮，重輯刋　者也。</p>
<p>純白老人題郭天錫山水云：「危峯千伋翠蒼蒼，彷彿匡　有草堂，聞道山人徵不起，紫芝春暖白雲香」。按郭天錫名畀，一字佑之，號雲山，元丹徒人。工書畫，曾學書於趙孟頫，妙得其法，爲寫松雪集，孟頫跋其後，稱當備至；畫作窠木竹石，極有天趣。不　純白所題者，近尙存乎世間否？</p>
<p>筆於書畫，　功至偉。昌黎傳毛顥，述其世系封爵勛烈特　，極　風趣。頃見胡助筆銘，則謂其進退始終之道，一與人合。銘云：「內剛外圓，其用不息，始銳終鈍，敗於　墨，運諸掌握，惟意所適，天祿石渠，嘉乃丕績，顏筋柳骨，心維正直，書匪徒書，允　　德。」</p>
<p>趙仲穆書，克紹松　家學，第其詩詞，流傳至尠，間見於卷軸間，不過單辭數言而止。烏程王天兩氏，藏有趙雍手　，微明題跋，即今「知不足齋叢書」所本也。仲雍詩詞，淸麗可誦，如蝶戀花一闋云：「顏色如花膚似雪，嬌眼傳波，密意曾低說；罷帶同心愁未結，情多不忍成離別。　別後相思心更切，異日重逢，鏡裏花難折；寳篆香銷姻漸歇，玉簫吹　黄昏月。」其水調歌頭一闋云：「春色去何急？春去尙微寒，滿地落花芳草，漸覺綠陰圓；馬足車塵情味，暑往寒來歲月，擾擾十餘年；嬴得朱顏老，孤負好林泉。</p>
<p>寳裝鞍，金作　，玉爲鞭，須臾得志，紛華滿眼縱相　，功名自來無意，富貴浮雲何濟，於我亦徒然！萬事付一笑，莫放酒杯乾。」則尤有興亡骨肉之感，默寓其中矣。</p>
<p>「靑山不趁江流去，數點翠收林際雨，漁屋遠模糊，姻村半有無。大癡飛醉墨，秋與天爭碧，淨洗綺羅塵，一巢棲亂雲。」此王國器題黄大癡畫卷詞也。國器字德璉，吳興人，長於今樂府，詞致風流瀟洒，玉潤冰淸，乃今氏名涇沒，志吳興者，寂寥無聞，良可慨已。</p>
<h3>杜鵑花開的季節</h3>
<p>— 李玉田</p>
<p>他走時，是一個黯淡的早晨，</p>
<p>一個杜鵑花開遍山坡的季節。</p>
<p>他臨別曾說：讓一切由它使命去安排，</p>
<p>也許明年杜鵑花開的季節，又會歸來——</p>
<p>日子像無聲的洗水，默默的；</p>
<p>溜過了一年，二年……</p>
<p>現在，又是杜鵑花開的時候了，</p>
<p>但是他仍未歸來，也沒有信息……。</p>
<h3>漢白馬　拓片</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南藏</p>
<h3>楊花</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>楊花朶朶飄浮在我回歸的路上。</p>
<p>我聞着白楊花　射出芳香。</p>
<p>我住在綠色的深幽的林中，一間猩紅的小樓，鵝黄色的窗，海靑色的簾帳……</p>
<p>從窗外，我望見被曉風飄揚起的楊花；白色的楊花，純潔的楊花……</p>
<p>我有着珍惜那白雪的楊花的心情，但我不喜愛她沒有堅定的意志，飄浮不定，隨意零落。</p>
<p>當她以織弱的素手，斜倚在我紫色的窗前的時候，她採摘着那綠的枝葉，我講述着童年的流浪的故事，一直到她繡花的彩裙，堆滿了點點的落花……</p>
<p>我苦難的飄浮的故事啊！三天三夜也說不完。</p>
<h3>夢之頌</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>我是一個平凡的人，我也有多少無法達到的愛與慾；而夢却是最親切地接近每一個人的，因此，我愛上了夢。</p>
<p>它更是一個忠實的友人，待你無微不至，聽憑你的情感的指揮，它給你盡情的安慰，給你驅除失意和煩惱。</p>
<p>於是我離不開它，一個無夢之夜，等於一夜的失眠。</p>
<p>你假如還恨它一次，一次地欺騙了你，我應爲它辯護；這種欺瞞是善意和無礙的，借問，人生何處是眞境？</p>
<h3>馬克吐溫</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>當美國作家馬克吐溫遊歷歐洲時，一回在車突然被個英國人攔着控苦道：「馬先生，我寗願出十英鎊而不看你的　Huckleberry　Finn（馬氏名著童話）。」這下把馬克吐溫詫異的瞪着雙眼說不出話來，這個英國人這時才大笑道：「你這樣又使我再度事受到初次讀它的樂趣。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血527</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>從子珊這段說明看，守一和鶴見進入匪窩，也只在四個淘氣辦事之後，十來分鐘光景。想是賊巢巡哨回去，發見萍子給人救走，頓時烏亂起來；一面胡亂開槍助威，一面施放警笛，這本無所謂，也許有了這麽一番動作，回到上司那裏，就可造些謠言，搪塞長官，卸去責任的意思。這本是日寇的遭遇失敗時的固定辦法。</p>
<p>守一和鶴見把窩子參觀完了，會合了各方面動員的人馬，說明所見情形。李明等大家的意見，法華，和滬西兩個窩子，禁閉的只是兩個軍訓學生，却費了一頓手脚，才把窩子毁掉，這裏性質似較嚴重，怎能這等輕描淡寫，就成功了？惟恐事情沒有這般簡易，恐怕還有作用，所以約定了再度招集辦法，暫時化整為零，各回本部，等候消息</p>
<p>百忍莊這次　共出動十一人，法華滬西兩方面，共去六人，帮助李明和韓方的手下去辦事。四位淘氣，本來應該在外灘等候大家聚齊，再分頭向虹鎭進襲，沒有想到她們依舊淘氣到底，先把事情辦完了。這種作風，本來不妥當，但因以前，每次都呌她們成功，連曉莊也無辦法應付她們。直到八一三日倭發動滬戰，守一的令兄羽白等，五位智囊，害怕這些淘氣誤事，便請曉莊裏明覺厂老人，定了嚴格約法，她們才就了範圍。</p>
<p>鶴見坐在汽草裏，心上一塊石頭，仍舊放不下；要求守一設法打電話向百忍莊探問四位淘氣小姐的行踪，和萍子的究竟消息。正岩說「到了外灘，就有公用電話可借；時間太晚，這虹口一路，雖也有些地方可借電話，但究竟不方便。……」</p>
<p>造一着也被四個淘氣料到，她們早已發了電話到大旅社，萬歲館和百忍莊三處，說「戲」已唱完，成績十分滿意，請守一等都到百忍莊「慶祝」。</p>
<p>午夜零時，百忍莊的覺厂老人，因靑木長老那個墨圈圈的神秘玩意究竟有些游戲三昧意味；可靠而又不大可靠。像這等阻遏倭寇秘謀發動大舉侵略的舉動，關係何等重大，怎麼能專靠催眠術心靈術這一類的勾當，來規劇大計？所以他老人家，把這個問題，劃分成兩個方式辦現：</p>
<p>第一個方式，讓萍子仍舊依照她自己從靑木長老那英所得傳授，進行探求「心靈傳訊」。同時，覺厂老人自己，也應用心靈術，在自己靜室「添籌舊遊」裏試騐，看看有無效果。如能發生感應，就將所獲效果，取來和萍子的消息對證一下，看看是否相同。</p>
<p>第二個比較實際一跌的方式，乃由百忍莊的五位智囊，加上鶴見正岩和守一，把鶴見方面收集的秘密電訊，和眼前的局勢，細細參詳一下，然後硏究一個切實可行的計劃方案。正岩又爲這事，預備花幾十分鐘工夫，跑回電訊部去把零時以前收到的秘訊搜集了來。</p>
<h3>訪梅蘭芳　（一）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>復員返滬後不久，我托友介紹，登門拜訪梅蘭芳先生。次日的申報自由談中曾有人爲文記載，並登出我和他合攝的照片來，我久想自己來寫一篇訪問記：只因意遠言深，幾次欲說還休。今夕梅雨敲窗，銀燈照壁，好個抒情良夜，不免略述予懷。</p>
<p>我平生自動訪問素不相識的有名的人，以訪梅蘭芳為第一次。闊別十年的江南親友聞知此事，或許以爲我到大後方放浪十年，變了一個「戲迷」回來，一到就去捧「伶王」。其實完全不然。我十年流亡，一片冰心，依然是一個藝術和宗敎的信徒。我的愛平劇是藝術心所迫，我的訪梅蘭芳是宗教心所驅。這眞是意遠言深，不讀完這篇文章，是教人不能相偌的。</p>
<p>我的愛平劇，始於抗戰前幾年，綠綠堂初成的時候，我們新造房子，新買一架留聲機。唱片多數是西洋音樂，略買幾張梅期芳的唱片作爲點綴。因爲五四時代，有許多人反對平劇，要打倒牠，我讀了他們的文章，覺得有理，從此看不起平劇。不料留聲機上的平劇音樂，漸漸牽惹人倩，使我終於不買西洋音樂片子而專買平劇唱片，尤其是梅蘭芳的唱片了。原來五四文人所反對的，是平劇的含有封建毒素的陳腐的內容，而我所愛好是平劃的誇張的象徵的明快的形式—音樂與扮演。西洋音樂是「和聲的」（Hfarmonic），東洋音樂是「旋律的」（Melodic）。平劇的音樂，充分地發揮了「旋律的音樂」的特色。試看：牠沒有和聲，沒有伴奏，（胡琴是助奏，）甚至沒有短音階，沒有半音階，只用長音階的七個字（獨來米法掃拉西），能够單靠旋律的變化來表出靑衣，老生，大而等種種個性。所以聽戲，雖然不熱悉劇情，又聽不懂唱詞，也能從音樂中知道其人的身分，性格，及劇情的大槪。推想當初創作這些西皮二簧的時候，作者對於人生情味，一定具有異常充分的理解；同時對於描寫音樂一定具有異常敏捷的天才，故能抉取世間賢母，良妻，忠臣，孝子，莽夫，奸雄等各種性格的精華，加以音樂的誇張的象徵的描寫，而造成洗練明快的各種曲調，顚扑不破地沿用到今日　抗戰以前，我對平劇的愛好只限於聰，即專注於其音樂的方面，故我不上戲館，而專事收集唱片。緣綠堂收蹟的百餘張唱片中，多數是梅蘭芳唱的。廿六年冬，這些唱片與綠緣堂同　於於盡；勝利後重置一套，現已近於齊全了。</p>

<h3>焦大與劉四</h3>
<p>— 杞人</p>
<p>駡人應該不是洩洩憤怒就了事的，洩憤之外還須要有敎育的目的，那才不孤負駡的意義。</p>
<p>目前因爲不滿人意的事太多，大家沉不住氣，彼此大駡，原也難怪，但假如只管駡，駡得來神昏顚倒，反而壞事，像一般人口頭筆下所常提的痛駡大觀園中人的焦大，三杯下肚，酒性發作，把主子們醜惡盡情暴露，說什麽大觀園裏裏外外，除了門口兩座石頭獅子，便沒有一樣東西是乾凈的。話也不能說它不對，但這樣洩憤了事的焦大態度，我們並不希望於今日的人們。因爲今日人們自己是主子的身份，並不是處在奴才的地位，和焦大絕對不同。</p>
<p>我們所望於主子身份者，大家寗可做劉四，不要做焦大。舊唐書記劉子翼事云：</p>
<p>「劉子翼性不容非，面折人短，友人李伯藥常稱曰：劉四雖復駡人，人都不恨。」</p>
<p>劉四何以能達到這樣的地位，因爲他自己有把握相信自己今日駡了人異日不會再挨人駡，他的駡人，完全是出於善意的，含着敎育的至情至理的，聽他駡的人，不但心甘，而且樂從，這就比較焦大的謾駡結果，除被塗進一嘴馬糞而外，別無所得，似乎高明多了。</p>
<p>大家應該努力學學劉四的行徑，切不要再以焦大自居了。焦大雖然也有過衛護買家老爺子的大功，也不必如此倚酒裝瘋，只圖痛快一時，應該想想後果，不要以洩憤爲最終的目的才是。</p>
<p>駡人的和被駡的，彼此都能以愛爲出發點，做到「不恨」的地步，這才是我們所竭誠希冀的。</p>
<h3>拒絕貸欵</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>戰後歐亞的許多國家多希望獲得外來的助力但葉門國的國王却乾脆地拒絕了人家的帮助。</p>
<p>法國新聞社開羅二日電：「報載葉門國京城消息：葉門國王伊曼已拒絕美國提供之貸款，理由爲此舉將使葉門之資源落於美國人之手」。我們能說伊曼頑固嗎？能說他不受抬舉嗎？就他的拒絕理由來說，倒還不是貿貿然的冒失舉措。他的自信力似乎很强，覺得無須藉他人之力來解決自己的問題。葉門這國度的名稱太陌生，大槪他沒有舉足重輕的關係，報紙上不大見到他的名字，他的情形也不甚淸楚；但可斷言的：他一定在現階段有「問題」，因此才有人「提供貸款」，然而伊曼却毅然加以拒絕了。</p>
<p>在我國，儘有人穿不暖，吃不飽，甚至無法活下去而自殺，裏華的塲面還到處可見；這豪華的塲面却掩蓋不了經濟危機的悲慘情景，反使這種情景更尖銳的顯露出來，因此「問題」多的是，如果在這時期有人給我們以助力，當然表示歡迎。不過遠水救不得近火，是以在此次國參會中有人喊出了「有錢出錢」的救急辦法，還有人提出了「徵用私人鉅額游資」的建議。我們沒有伊曼樣的舅氣來拒絕他人於千里之外，而國參會諸公的建議却有擁護的必要。我們不但在「報屁股」上表示擁護，還希望政府能將此項建議付之實施。</p>
<h3>感恩多</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>五百枚原子彈可毁滅全世界</p>
<p>——合衆社洛杉磯電，原子能會議閉幕席上有人這樣說。</p>
<p>好兇原子彈，廣島苗頭見，島民逃死難，覺心寒！</p>
<p>五百枚拋世界，大家完！大家完！只剩英雄，凱旋天外天？</p>
<p>註，「旋」字雙關。</p>
<h3>孟夏草木長</h3>
<p>— 子愷</p>
<h3>英王的茶會</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>英王喬治和王后伊里薩白日前在倫敦白金漢宮舉行了一次茶會，招待賓客五千人。這是一件作爲英倫社交界的盛事，每一個人都以被柬邀而引爲榮寵。但是這茶會使　至盡歡的並不是豐富的飲食和豪華的佈置，祗是一杯淸茶，一塊蛋糕，和樂隊奏送的修揚底音樂而已。</p>
<p>作爲君主，以這樣簡陋的茶點招待五千貴客，在東方，是會認做一種超乎常情的怠慢。如果以一個平民身份來如此接待客人，也會被輕視做寒酸相的，但是英王與王后是這樣來招待客人了。這裏，不容我們設想王室的貧窮，因為以英王與王后來豪華的招待客人是可以充分做到的。</p>
<p>在這裏，包含着一種深遠的意義。</p>
<p>這意義是告訴英國人民要節約，要以節約來促使戰後復興。</p>
<p>當這個茶會的報導，讓我們讀到時，我們所想到的是，英國是以君主的平民身份來維護它的民主制度的。在法律前面，英王與王后是最最遵守的模範公民，他們在戰時與平民一樣領取衣物配給證，得到同樣的購買點數，在戰後，他們也同樣響應工黨內閣的節儉的呼籲。</p>
<p>反觀諸己，在我們國內，一般社曾的流俗觀念，都以豪華擺闊眩人，以豪華擺闊爭面子，千百人的奢靡建築在億萬人的貧困上。尤其上層社會整年整月都在酣歌歡舞之中，不是園遊，就是鷄尾酒會，以一點一茶　客，宋之聞也。</p>
<h3>賀話劇界大集合</h3>
<p>— 風雲</p>
<p>聽說六月底觀衆演出公司也將退出辣斐戲院，以後除了蘭心戲院還可以借一借塲子以外，就沒有　本的戲院可以上演話劇。</p>
<p>現在上海十一個話劇團體，已經決定經常假海光戲院作爲經常演出的塲子，在商借戲院如此困難的情形下，我們應當爲全上海的話劇團體致賀，因爲他們從今天想已經有一個共同演出的戲院了。</p>
<p>這十一個劇社的名稱是：上海劇藝社，中華劇藝社，中國演劇社，上海實騐劇社，新中國劇社，觀衆演出公司，市立劇校，中萬劇團，郵工劇團，兒童劇團等。首次演出，是由新中國劇社獻演歐陽予倩的歷史劇「桃花扇」，預定十一日起正式上演，十日晚彩排招待各界。</p>
<p>上海話劇界爲了慶祝話劇界的大團結，決定於七八兩日日夜塲舉行聯歡大會，兩天節目，大約如次：</p>
<p>（一）大合唱：中華昔樂學校。</p>
<p>（二）朗誦：白楊，泰怡，舒　文，楊薇，陶金，李健吾，金燄，趙丹。</p>
<p>（三）號外：田漢，曹禺，歐陽予倩，熊佛西，應雲衛，周伯勳，顧仲彝，吳祖光。</p>
<p>（四）獨唱：呂鑄洪，周璇，朱球，歐陽敬如。</p>
<p>（五）舞蹈：市立劇校：錢風，塲國輝。</p>

<p>（八）話劇：「處女的心」—郵工劇團「早餐之前」—劇校。「女房東」—中萬劇團。（九）滑稽：楊華生，張樵農。</p>
<p>最後希望話劇界團結一致，共同携手，爲中國戲劇奮鬥，爲中國文化遝動奮鬥！</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>緋緋讓一位女團員攙着，挨在效母親的藤椅的旁邊，眼淚汪汪的　哭，好幾個人用糖菓去哄她也沒有用。</p>
<p>蘭勉强睜開眼睛，瞪了她一眼，心裏想跟她銳許多話，但站上的人聲那麼嘈雜，她實在沒有力氣可以把聲音提高起來。</p>
<p>「緋緋，乖孩子，別哭！過兩三天你又可以跟媽在一起了」！那個女團員帮着勸慰。</p>
<p>「我怕，我怕……我不會再見到媽了……」。這個七歲的女孩子竟意外地說出了一句怪不詳的話語來。</p>
<p>祝兆年正好拉着張昌走過來，聽緋緋這樣說，心裏也覺得很不快，忙俯下身去，用手拖住了她的嘴，一面凑在她耳朶邊輕輕地說：「別這樣說，緋緋，這樣說媽媽和祝伯伯都要不歡喜你了」！</p>
<p>可是這孩子却反而嚎啕大哭起來。</p>
<p>「朱小姐，請你暫時把她抱開去」。束手無策的祝兆年祗能也用一次强迫手段，請那女團員立刻把緋緋拖走。</p>
<p>蘭無聲息地　了一口氣。</p>
<p>祝兆年想向蘭勸慰幾句，可是一陣喧擾，那四位咤叱風雲，掌生殺大權的司機老爺已發出了開車的命令。搭客誰敢躭延，四輛車上立刻亂成了一片。年輕的張昌也開始慌亂起來，他也想奮勇搶上前去，但馬上又想到了自己同行的還有一位書着重病的女太太，便又縮住了脚步，回頭來向祝兆年望，想等待他決定。</p>

<h3>Shandong Western Newly Recovered County Assemblies Send Representatives to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Strengthening River Defense and Building Local Armed Forces</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The county assemblies of the newly recovered counties in southwestern Shandong have dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the government to strengthen river defenses and assist in building local armed forces. They held a press conference at 3 PM on the 5th, where Guo Junqing, speaker of the Heze County Assembly, Lian Ruan, member of the Pu County Assembly, and Zhang Chunting, member of the Dingtao County Assembly, reported separately. It was claimed that the purpose of this petition is threefold: (1) To request the rapid consolidation of river defenses, as the Communist forces entrenched on the north bank of the Yellow River are constantly planning to create artificial breaches. According to reliable intelligence, the Communist forces are actively building boats, with over a hundred already completed that can hold two hundred people, ready to flee to the south bank at any time. The people of southwestern Shandong are eagerly hoping that the government will send more troops to take responsibility for river defense and quickly allocate more funds and materials to repair the south bank dikes in the area controlled by the Nationalist forces from Lanfeng to Shou Zhang. (2) To request the government to quickly assist in building local armed forces. Currently, the Nationalist forces are concentrated in several garrisons, and Communist forces are still found in the villages, even subjecting them to their reign of terror. All parties cannot tolerate its harm, so they rise up empty-handed and launch joint village self-defense. However, they suffer heavy casualties due to the lack of weapons. If the government can allocate firearms and ammunition to assist in building local armed forces, the situation will definitely greatly improve. (3) To request the government to order the garrison troops and border Nationalist forces to pay market prices when requisitioning grain. Southwestern Shandong has suffered a decade of disaster, with the people impoverished and wealth exhausted. The grain requisitioned by the Nationalist forces is paid at less than one-third of the market price, which affects the income of the people and makes their livelihoods more difficult. It is heard that they will petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and other relevant agencies in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Gunboat Detachment Seizes Smuggling Sea Vessel</h3>
<p>Ship Owner Dai Anhua Already Sent to Qingdao Under Custody</p>

<h3>Communist Forces Transferring to Western Hebei, Preparing for Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>Nationalist Forces Along Beining Line Increase Defenses</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 5th] The Communist forces in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have all been transferred to western Hebei and are gradually pressing towards the west side of the railway. The situation on the Pingbao Line is becoming increasingly tense. The Communist forces have a tendency to seize the opportunity to invade. Also, it is rumored that Zhu De and Xu Xiangqian are leading a cavalry unit to Fuping, where they have been holding meetings with Communist commanders in Hebei for days, claiming to launch a summer offensive in Hebei and Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Communist forces in Hebei are continuing to increase. More than 3,000 Communist soldiers arrived near Changli yesterday, and they have the intention of attacking Tangshan and cutting off the Beining Railway.

The members of the Democratic Socialist Party who have joined the Full Faction account for about two-thirds of the total, with the most in North China and Northeast China. Wu Xianzis ability has now been shown and he is expected to return to Hong Kong in about a week.</p>
<h3>Hu Haimen to Offer Opinions on the Issue of Protecting Human Rights</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] People from the Democratic Socialist Party are deeply concerned about the issue of those arrested in various places. Hu Haimen plans to raise an appeal for the protection of human rights at the State Council meeting to be held on the morning of the 6th.

<h3>Siege of Longhua in Western Rehe Lifted; Comfort Mission to Chengde to Offer Condolences</h3>

<p>[Another Dispatch] After the Longhua siege was lifted, General Shi Jue, commander of the Rehe Western Suijing District, told reporters: The Communist forces' offensive in Western Rehe this time, like the May offensive of Yunnian, was aimed at annihilating the 13th Army and occupying Rehe. However, its failure is exactly the same as in Yunnian. More than half of the five brigades of the Communist forces were casualties, and the total number annihilated should reach two brigades. The remnants are retreating towards Wangtaifu (under Chifeng). The Nationalist forces are still pursuing and suppressing them. Shi continued: The Communist forces have been heavily damaged, and they probably dare not face Western Rehe directly again.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In order to comfort the Nationalist troops in Xinghua and the public and religious personnel who died in the disaster, and to provide relief to merchants and civilians, the Chengde All Circles Comfort Mission was specially established. It has raised a total of 120 million yuan, 17 tons of flour, 35 pigs, and 500 cigarettes. Today, Li Shoulian, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Deng Wuliang, the Commander of the Suijing Emergency Relief Brigade, led representatives of the party, government, and people to Longhua.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 5th] Military news: The Nationalist forces from Chahar supporting Western Rehe reached Fengning at 6 PM on the 4th.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Shaanxi and Henan Nationalist forces are continuously entering Shanxi. Most of the previously lost ferries have been recovered. After the Maojin Ferry on the north bank was recovered, the Nationalist forces continued to capture Guanzhuang and have approached the suburbs of Xia County.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Ruicheng in southern Shanxi was recovered yesterday afternoon. The Da'an Village and other ferries on the north bank of the Yellow River have all returned to the hands of the Nationalist forces. Also, the Nationalist forces outside Ji County in western Shanxi have recovered San Ai in southern Jing and are attacking Xiang Ning in the vicinity.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 5th] The situation in southern and western Shanxi is not as optimistic as rumored. In addition to recovering Maojin Ferry, Ruicheng, Jiexian, Pinglu in southern Shanxi and establishing contact with Anyi, Yuncheng, and Xia County, there are no new developments. Western Shanxi is only defending Ji County, and the focus of the battle is now on Xiangling, with a tendency to turn to Linfen. The telephone communication in Xiangling and Linfen was interrupted on the 4th.

The small arsenal in Tutancun, Lingqiu, has also been moved to Xiaguanzhen (east of Pingxingguan).</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] It is reported that after the Nationalist forces in northern Shaanxi launched another offensive against Mizhi, they broke into Mizhi city yesterday, and street fighting is fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhengzhou Dispatch, 5th] The Nationalist forces garrisoning Anyang launched an attack on the 5th and recovered the Anyang airport. They are currently repairing the equipment.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 5th] More than 2,000 troops of the Communist 9th Column, Rao Zijian's unit, fled from Suqian back to Chishan Luomiao northeast of Sixian, occupied Sishan and Gaoji, and plotted to capture the cities of Si and Ling counties. The Sixian government appealed to the garrison troops to conduct a suppression campaign. As the new wheat came on the market, grain prices plummeted, with rice falling by 150,000 yuan per dan.

<h3>In Response to the Current Economic Situation, Zhang Qun Plans to Propose a New Plan; To Be Submitted for Discussion at Today's State Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nandong Dispatch, 5th] The Financial Committee of the National Economic Commission held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the issue of industrial downsizing. It is heard that the amount of subsidies will be reduced as much as possible, and the expenses of government agencies will also be tightened.</p>

<h3>Minister of Finance Talks to the Press on the Issue of Principal and Interest on Public Bonds</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun hosted the press tonight and said that the government will redeem public bonds issued before and during the war at face value. The government has redeemed public bonds during the war at face value, including principal and interest. The National Political Council's proposal that the government pay double the principal and interest on public bonds at face value is unfair to those who have not redeemed the bonds. Also, since public bonds can be transferred, if double the amount is paid to those who currently hold the bonds or those who were not the original purchasers, only a limited number of bondholders will benefit, while taxpayers will bear a heavier burden.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Chinese Currency Requires Economic Assistance, Cheng Tianfang Says in the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco Dispatch, 4th] Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese representative attending the Paris meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, announced here today that stabilizing China's currency and postwar economy requires a large amount of funds, and the $500 million designated for loans to China will be the first installment. Cheng did not want to speculate on how much more money might be needed in the end. However, he pointed out that when the Export-Import Bank initially designated $500 million, the official Chinese exchange rate was 2,000 yuan of legal tender to one U.S. dollar. Now, the official exchange rate is 12,000 yuan, and the black market rate is 33,000 yuan. Unless the United States makes a decision on this loan before the end of June, the U.S. Congress will inevitably re-discuss the loan issue. Republican Congressman Jute and other congressmen recently told me in Washington that they will urge Congress to make a decision before the end of June. Secretary of State Marshall did try to achieve an impossible reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists, but the Chinese Communists never tried to reconcile. They never wanted to cooperate and only pretended to do so to buy time and deceive the outside world. The deteriorating cycle of inflation is further worsened by the continuing conflict with the Chinese Communists, resulting in repeated exacerbations of inflation. Cheng concluded by saying that he will travel in the United States and Canada for several months before returning home.</p>
<h3>Dalian Industry Being Dismantled</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] It was learned today that the government's mission to inspect Lushun and Dalian arrived in Dalian on the 4th and discovered that most of the heavy industry had been dismantled and transported to the Soviet-occupied areas of Korea as "war booty." The rest was transported south to Yantai, which is under the control of the Communist forces.</p>
<h3>All Newspapers in Wuxi Suspended Publication; Liabilities Exceed Assets and Cannot Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 5th] Due to the impact of rising prices, five newspapers in Wuxi, namely Wuxi Daily, Youxi News, Renbao, Daxi News, Jiangsu Minbao, and Daobao, have liabilities exceeding the total value of their assets. Advertising and distribution costs cannot be increased proportionally. For the past half month, each newspaper has been losing an average of one million yuan per day. The wages of printing workers and staff cannot be paid. Today, the Daily Newspaper Association held an emergency meeting and decided to suspend all publications from the 6th and apply to the county government to seal up the assets and sell them to repay debts. According to the Daily Newspaper Association, there are two reasons for the suspension of publication: (1) The income and expenses of the newspapers have not been able to offset each other in the past. High-interest loans have been borrowed, and the burden of interest alone is unbearable. (2) The wages of printing workers were originally 12 to 22 yuan before the war. After the victory, wages are calculated in terms of rice, averaging from 2.2 dan to 3.3 dan. As a result, each newspaper has difficulty bearing the costs and has repeatedly consulted with the workers, suggesting restoring the pre-war basic salary and paying it at 70% of the cost of living index. The workers insisted that it must be calculated based on the original basic salary converted to the current market price of rice. The opinions of the two sides differed greatly, resulting in a deadlock.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Chinese Communist Aviation School</h3>
<p>— Central News Agency Reporter Wang Wanjun</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] The Chinese Communist Party has begun its attempt to bomb Nanjing with aircraft. Although this attempt is far from materializing due to the CCP's current lack of an air force and its distance from possessing the means to utilize transport or reconnaissance aircraft, CCP members are currently relying on external assistance to establish an aviation school in the mountainous areas near Dong'an City on the northeastern border. Their dream air force's cradle is currently located at 45 degrees north latitude and 133 degrees east longitude, west of the Ussuri River on the southeastern Sino-Soviet border of Hejiang Province, north of Lake Khanka, in the northwestern mountains of Dong'an City on the Hulin to Linkou Railway. According to the puppet Manchukuo meteorological reports, this area is in the northern frigid zone, frequently experiences cold currents, has a maximum temperature of 42 degrees, first clouding up in late autumn, thaws in April, and experiences frequent storms in spring and summer.</p>
<p>After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CCP immediately dispatched its only aviation contingent from Yan'an, led by Chang Qiankun, who had studied piloting in the Soviet Union. They crossed the sea from Longkou, Shandong, to Zhuanghe in eastern Liaoning, and from Zhuanghe, they continued by rail to Shenyang and then to Tonghua. There, they transferred approximately forty Japanese training aircraft obtained with the assistance of a certain party and established an aviation headquarters. Subsequently, with Tonghua about to be captured by the National Army, the team moved to Mudanjiang in Songjiang Province. In early 1946, to facilitate supplies, the team moved from Mudanjiang to Dong'an in Hejiang Province and was formally renamed the Aviation School, with Chang Qiankun as the principal. The school currently has over one hundred students. Only one class has graduated from the flight program, all of whom were selected from the Communist army who were graduates of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Juxian, Shandong), specifically, all forty-two members were selected from the Fifth Cultural Work Team of the university's fifth class. A few months ago, one student was killed by a train, and another was injured and dismissed for other reasons, so only forty pilots graduated. A second class was established, the mechanics program, with seventy students. The mechanics program students were mostly selected from "loyal and reliable" Communist army cadres. Although there are aviation talents in the Northeast Communist army, they are not selected. The CCP maintains absolute secrecy about its only aviation school. Even cadres are unaware of its existence, and outsiders have no way of knowing the inside story. The school's external designation is "Unit 61."</p>
<p>The school is organized with a school affairs office, an education office, and a political department. The education office has flight and mechanical departments. The head of the flight department, Wang Lianzeng, was sent to the Soviet Union from Yan'an to study aviation. The head of the mechanical department is a Korean Communist, transferred from North Korea. The leader of the pilot squadron, a Mr. Liu, also studied aviation in the Soviet Union, and the deputy leader is Xian Jin. There are approximately ten instructors, all of whom are Japanese forced to remain by the Communist army. One is Korean, and the rest are Japanese. The school also has a maintenance team (managing aircraft) and two repair shops, staffed mostly by Japanese, except for the supervisors. As for the training method, because the instructors are Japanese, Korean, and Soviet-trained, they adopt the Japanese and Soviet systems, and the lectures are translated into Chinese from Japanese and Soviet aviation school materials. Training is divided into basic and advanced levels. Academic subjects include flight repair, flight science, mechanics, physics, political science, and mathematics. The aircraft used for training are all Japanese trainers left behind in the Northeast, mostly Type 91 single-engine aircraft. Their so-called "twin-engine" aircraft number only four or five. The school has a total of about one hundred relatively complete and damaged aircraft. The aircraft are old, and the fuselages have been moved frequently, with bullet holes everywhere. None are intact, making them extremely difficult to control. The engines are difficult to start, so accidents during training occur more than ten times a month. Many of the trainees are afraid to practice takeoffs. Almost nineteen of the graduates have never flown an aircraft in the air.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party attempts to seize power by force, but it is deeply troubled by the weakness of its ground forces, so it is plotting to train pilots. Once the time is ripe, it can obtain strength from the air, fulfilling its treasonous ambitions. Their hopes are pinned on this aviation school on the Ussuri River. However, what is even more noteworthy is that the CCP established this school in Dong'an because the area has convenient transportation. Therefore, it can exchange large quantities of grain and materials for aircraft and aviation equipment without obstacles, making procurement convenient. Moreover, if the school site is threatened by the National Army, it can be quickly moved elsewhere by rail. This is also part of their calculations. This article is written based on the accounts of Wang Jingchuan, a graduate of the school's first class who recently defected to the National Army, and Sun Shanshu, a student at the school. Wang Jingchuan was a student in the fifth class of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Shandong and a member of the Communist Party. According to his own account, his academic performance was quite excellent. He said that the Communist Party's call in northern Shaanxi for a "ceasefire after the victory of the war against Japan" has not been honored over the years. Instead, there has been intensified roaming and infighting, causing the people to suffer. Therefore, he resolutely defected to the National Army. The following is an excerpt from Wang's remarks, used as the conclusion of this article: "The Communist Party's senior leaders attach great importance to and cherish our school, but although we have been studying aviation for nearly a year, we are still laymen in aviation. The reason is that the aircraft we are learning to fly are all broken and dilapidated aircraft left behind by the Japanese. They dream of one day being able to let us fly aircraft to bomb Nanjing. The students all secretly find this ridiculous. It is simply as absurd as a myth. However, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, I would like the government to pay attention to one point: the Communist Party will stop at nothing to obtain aircraft. In addition to exchanging grain and other materials, they can offer conditions that sell out the interests of the motherland to get everything they need. Our principal has repeatedly told us that although the training aircraft we are using now are dilapidated, after we complete our studies, there are many aircraft with good performance waiting for us to use in a certain place in the country. He also said that our aviation equipment is not good now, but as long as we work slowly and continuously, we can train a huge air force in the future to help us reach our destination. As for whether the destination is Nanjing or the heads of all 450 million kind Chinese people so that they can taste the taste of bombs, I (Wang Jingchuan speaking) do not know."</p>

<h3>Kātayama Tetsu Speaks: Japan Plans to Send Delegation to China, Says Relations Should Be Revised</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Kātayama Tetsu told Central News Agency reporters today that the Japanese people hope to restore relations with China on the basis of candid and sincere cooperation and peace. He will take active steps to organize and send a delegation, after the peace conference (if he is still serving as prime minister at that time), to apologize to the Chinese people on behalf of the Japanese people for the pillage by Japanese troops in China. The reporter said: When the war ended, Prime Minister Higashikuni also had similar plans, but was blocked by the opposition. Will such figures still block this delegation from going to China? Kātayama said that when Higashikuni was prime minister, some officials and bureaucrats responsible for the war held positions in the government, but they have now been purged. He believes that the Japanese people should support the delegation to China. Kātayama also said that past Japanese talk of Sino-Japanese cooperation was mostly false. However, in the future, the Japanese people should demand that they maintain proper relations with China and avoid the recurrence of the past. Because of the lessons learned from the last war, the relationship between the Japanese people and the people of other countries, especially China, should be revised.</p>
<p>Central News Agency hosted a luncheon for Kātayama Tetsu this afternoon, the first time Kātayama has attended a private banquet since taking office as prime minister. He said that he will do everything possible to make the Japanese people and people all over the world understand any actions of his government. He wants to make it impossible for anyone to suspect that Japan and the Japanese people have any secret plans like the Germans did after World War I. Regarding the terms of the peace treaty, the Japanese government does not intend to engage in secret activities to influence any Allied country. The reporter asked if he understood the Chinese people's concern about Japan's true intentions and their concern about Japan's desire to restore its dominant position in the Far East's economy. Kātayama said that he believes that China should use its resources to improve the lives of the people of Asian countries and hopes that Japan can demonstrate its new attitude of true friendship and its desire to seek genuine cooperation for mutual benefit and prove that it is qualified to participate in the community of nations. Regarding the restoration of Japanese industry, Kātayama said that certain industrial activities are necessary for Japan to survive in the modern world. The textile industry is the most important, but this is only one of the most important economic problems facing the country today. His government will mobilize efforts both internally and externally, mobilize the people, and curb black market activities and the extravagant lifestyles of some people. Kātayama said that he believes he has the support of the people, and the people can make the government's policies on these issues effective. He believes that the people follow the government, and the past government's use of force has had no significant effect because the people do not like this bureaucratic attitude. Moreover, under the current circumstances, a coalition of various parties is most beneficial to Japan, but the Liberal Party seems to be unable to join his government. He said that he plans to formulate a plan based on a long-term foundation, which will include a period of time after the peace conference. If the people continue to support him at that time, it can be realized.</p>

<h3>Lin Shuyan Suggests Methods for Absorbing Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Results Achieved in Consultations in Beijing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Lin Shuyan, Chairman of the Nanyang Chinese Remittance Association, came to Beijing via Hong Kong and Xiamen some time ago to investigate the situation of overseas remittances and request the authorities to formulate measures to absorb overseas remittances.

<h3>Carp Gift Tour Series 3: Qufu, "Not Knowing the Taste of Meat for Three Months"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>Following a dirt road from Yanzhou, I embarked on the territory of Qufu County, the hometown of Confucius. On the way, I encountered many brand-new ten-wheeled trucks, fully loaded with military supplies. This series of convoys is precisely the sole condition demonstrating the advantage of the National Army in the battle of southern Shandong.</p>
<p>The construction of the highway is unexpectedly smooth. Because there are not many bends, it can be described as a "shortcut." This is originally a characteristic of the Shandong Plain: there are no rivers, no mountains. Drawing a straight line on the road easily becomes a flat highway.</p>
<p>Because the weather is too dry, many small rivers have dried up. The fine sand of the riverbed is fully exposed to the sunlight. Looking from a distance, the color is white, making it look like a cement-built highway.</p>
<p>On both sides of the highway, the vast and boundless layer of sand and soil relies solely on a few graveside trees as the only decorations. From this, we think that the severe drought in southern Shandong is related to the lack of forests. However, reality and ideals are inversely proportional. The original trees in southern Shandong, because residents are in a fuel shortage and need wood for construction in years of battle, have not only not been cultivated, but have even been uprooted.</p>
<p>What is most regrettable is that, especially on the "Sacred Imperial Road" outside the scenic city of Qufu, many of the tall poplar trees on both sides have also been cut down. What remains is only a white root head, which looks particularly glaring. Thinking of the past scene of lush shade-lined roads, how much there is to curse!</p>
<p>Qufu, a small city that became famous because of Confucius, is unique in that it is full of ancient and fragrant sentiments. Ancient cypresses that are hundreds of years old, and elderly people with long gowns trailing on the ground and white hair fluttering, similarly evoke nostalgic feelings. If there were no military vehicles speeding through the streets, how "quiet" and "civilized" it would be!</p>
<p>Looking at the door plaques and household names on the people's houses, it is not difficult to find many descendants of Confucius's disciples. When I was a student at the elementary school, I would casually meet several elementary school students surnamed Kong. Talking about it, it turned out that they were the young masters inside the "Holy Mansion."</p>
<p>The prices here are not proportional to the low standard of living because of being located in a remote area. On the contrary, when we asked the residents in the city about the price of rice and meat, we were given a heartbreaking answer. A housewife said, "We can't afford these things, so we don't know the price!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, two thousand years ago, Confucius, in an environment of poverty and contentment, said the callous remark "not knowing the taste of meat for three months" after listening to music. Now, two thousand years later, in his hometown, due to the chaos of war and the decline of people's livelihood, they truly "do not know the taste of meat." Moreover, the time is more than the short "three months" that he said!</p>
<p>At the county government, I met County Magistrate Wang, a big shot who had fought guerrilla warfare in Shandong. He is fat, of imposing stature, and speaks quite frankly. In his conversation, in addition to reporting on some county government work, he also hoped that reporters would appeal for him to get some relief supplies. Everything is as expected, and is the same as the tone of any county magistrate, saying that they cannot leave behind the word "poor."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Qufu, we can see a general picture from the checkpoint at the city gate: a sentry does not lightly let us pass just because the county magistrate is with us. Whether leaving or entering the city, he insisted on writing down our names and numbers, although we did not do so in the end. In addition, the sentry reported a piece of "intelligence," saying that two people in military uniform with weapons and two "plainclothes" had driven into the city. Afterwards, after listening to his words and seeing his nervous look, we couldn't help but laugh. It turned out that the two "plainclothes" were colleagues who were touring together this time. The other two armed people were Commander Zhang of the Third Regiment of Military Police and the Information Director of the Eighty-fourth Division.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The third session of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been discussing various important bills since its opening on May 26. It was originally scheduled to close on the 3rd, but due to the large number of proposals that had not yet been discussed, the meeting was repeatedly extended and finally closed successfully on the afternoon of the 5th. This meeting was held at a time of turbulent student movements and social unrest. All council members focused their attention on the "stability" aspect of Shanghai's future municipal construction, especially the measures taken to guide the student movement, which are worthy of our praise. Shanghai was able to safely overcome the difficulties of "June 2." This city council was able to mediate between the citizens and the government, and worked hard to guide the student movement so that the authorities and students would not go to extremes. This has made a great contribution. Anything that truly represents the will of the people will have considerable gains, and this can be clearly proven here.</p>
<p>However, we silently observe that what the general public is most interested in regarding the resolutions of this city council is not so much the major national affairs and municipal plans, but rather the many trivial issues that have a direct impact on their lives. Because politics is the business of the people, and the highest principle of managing the affairs of the people lies in being able to increase the happiness of the people and reduce the suffering of the people. The advantage of modern democratic politics is that the public's feelings can be conveyed, and the people, whether in terms of material life or in terms of spiritual boredom, have their elected representatives as their spokespersons, calling out for them and urging them to be relieved. Before the opening of this city council, Speaker Pan specially went to various districts of Shanghai to visit citizens and explore public opinion. At the same time, he also held seven days of municipal forums in various districts to exchange opinions on municipal construction and reform, so as to submit them to the council for discussion and come up with a concrete plan to be implemented by the municipal authorities. This method is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan summarized twelve practical problems based on his inspection of the administration of various districts and provided them to the city council for discussion. These twelve practical problems are generally related to the daily life of citizens, seem to be lacking high-sounding theories, and have nothing new. (1) Determine the functions and status of the people's representative assemblies and the district offices in each district to establish the foundation of local autonomy; (2) solve the office space of the people's representative assemblies, district offices, and guarantee units in each district; (3) promptly confirm the demarcation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government; (4) quickly supply tap water to poor areas so that the general public can drink it to avoid epidemics during the summer; (5) develop transportation roads and water and electricity supply in the suburbs so that people can move to the suburbs; (6) quickly repair the roads in each district to facilitate the travel of citizens; (7) promptly solve the garbage and manure problem in the city to restore public health; (8) guide and correct the construction of shacks by the poor to prevent fires; (9) increase the number of ferries between Puxi and Pudong to improve transportation; (10) the land occupied by the airport should be requisitioned and paid for or returned separately, and other civilian land, houses, and warehouses that have been occupied should also be returned through negotiation to ensure the safety of the people; (11) quickly clear the floating coffins in the suburbs; (12) quickly allocate land for each district to build schools to launch the school donation movement. These issues related to the lives of citizens do not need to be explained with profound theories, but only require the municipal authorities to implement them earnestly. Perhaps these trivial and ordinary problems are not valued by those who talk about municipal administration, but we feel that they are very important.</p>
<p>We should see that although today's Shanghai is superficially draped in a prosperous and beautiful coat, in reality, it has long cast a dark shadow of depression in all industries and people's lack of livelihood! Especially in the remote suburbs or in places where the poor live, if compared with the many places of wine, women, and wealth, it can be seen that today's Shanghai has been divided into two completely different worlds: one is heaven, where individuals are fortunate enough to live a luxurious life, the so-called gold-selling dens where money is spent like dirt; the other is hell on earth, where people are not fed enough, their clothes are tattered, they have no roof over their heads, no land under their feet, and they are barely surviving under the pressure of high prices, without knowing what the next day will bring. If we want to prosper the market, and if we want to seek stability in Shanghai, and seek progress in stability, then the Shanghai municipal authorities must set an example for improvement to raise the living standards of the common people, because in today's Shanghai, the number of citizens living a luxurious and extravagant life in heaven is very small, and the vast majority of citizens are forced to struggle under the heavy burden of life, almost unable to breathe! They are urgently hoping that the municipal authorities can pay attention to their inhuman lives. The mayor and the heads of various bureaus and departments are officials who are close to the people. If they also take turns going to various districts for on-the-spot inspections, we believe that they will definitely be able to understand more about the citizens who are struggling on the starvation line. Due to the activation of their compassionate hearts, they will actively stand on the side of the majority of the common people and try to improve their lives, then there will be a significant change in Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<p>Secondly, we especially admire the city council's vision and the decisiveness of its resolutions. For example, the review report on the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan and the resolution of the General Assembly, although only a few, the determination that the plan must be coordinated with national defense and the construction of the Oriental Port, as well as the decision on the principles of zoning, and the establishment of a standing committee for reviewing urban plans, are all long-term plans related to the future development of Shanghai, and are worthy of being a great goal of starting from small places and acting from nearby places. For example, the proposed organization of the "Committee for Investigating Activities that Violate the Interests of the Chinese People" starts from Shanghai alone, but it can affect the entire country in the future. On this point, the city council has pointed out an important work that all true people's institutions in the country should jointly strive for in the near future. Looking at this work from the perspective of the country and the people, it is extremely important to do it carefully and correctly so that there are no longer lurking terrifying elements in Chinese society who are bent on violating the interests of the Chinese people and engaging in activities that destroy the motherland. The U.S. Congress already has an organization called the "Committee for Investigating Un-American Activities." They investigate the activities of people who violate American interests in great detail, and the reports they publish are valued by the world. The U.S. government often uses the reports of this committee as important reference material when implementing national policies. In the past, our country did not have the people or people's representatives automatically standing up to do this kind of work for the country, but this time, the City Council Assembly was able to initiate it first, which shows their vision and decisiveness. We hope that the citizens can fully and sincerely, under the promotion of the council, take on the responsibility of accurate investigation, and their contribution to national peace and social stability will be extremely significant.</p>

<h3>Hungary Establishes Communist Government. Truman Denounces It as Illegal. Britain and the United States Request Documents from the Soviet Union Regarding Hungary.</h3>
<p>[News from our agency] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: President Truman today criticized the Hungarian Communist government, pointing out that the government is illegal and stating that the United States will not stand idly by. President Truman stated at a reception today that the State Department will investigate the entire Hungarian event, as the situation there is extremely serious.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The State Department announced today that it has requested the U.S. representative on the Allied Control Commission for Hungary to seek a copy of all information submitted by the Soviet chairman of the committee to the Hungarian government, "because all sources consistently believe that the resignation of Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy was the result of the Soviet Union submitting this information." A State Department spokesperson explained that this type of document is in the interests of the British and American governments, and according to the provisions of the Control Commission, the United States has the right to request a copy of this document.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th Dispatch] The British representative on the Allied Control Commission for Hungary has taken consistent action with the United States to request that the Soviet representative provide the documents submitted by the Soviet Union to the Hungarian government that caused former Prime Minister Nagy to resign. According to a Hungarian reporter, Nagy's resignation was purely due to the "political blackmail" of the Hungarian Communist Party, which had obtained full Soviet support.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 4th Dispatch] People here commenting on the political situation in Hungary say that the forced resignation of Prime Minister Nagy and the establishment of a pro-Soviet government in Hungary can be regarded as Moscow's first counterattack against the Truman Doctrine. The United States has now stopped lending money to Hungary, which is enough to deal the most serious blow to anti-Soviet elements in the country. President Truman and Marshall believe that this measure is futile and will only provide an excuse for the Soviet Union to establish a labor camp in the country. Washington also intends to issue a protest to the Soviet Union, but observers doubt whether this move will be effective, as delaying the matter will allow the Soviet Union to take the opportunity to consolidate the bases it has already acquired in order to finalize its control of Southeast and Central Europe. After Hungary is controlled, the Soviet Union can cut off Romania's contact with the West, and it will be impossible for the country to implement Western democracy. The Czech Republic, which has always wanted to become a hub for balancing the forces of the East and West, will also be under Soviet pressure as a result. What is most important is that Austria will also be trapped, unable to promote democracy. Yugoslavia to the south of Hungary, whose leader Tito recently delivered a speech and predicted the intention to form a federation with the Southern Slavic tribes, all of which should be noted.</p>
<h3>Marshall Frankly States that the Situation in Europe Is Very Serious and Opposes Any Government Enslaving Other Countries.</h3>
<p>[News from our agency] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Marshall delivered an important speech at the Harvard University Alumni Association today, urging European countries to unite and carry out great reconstruction work, saying that the United States will do its best to assist in this regard. At the same time, Marshall pointed out: "The United States will oppose any government that hinders the reconstruction of other countries." Secretary Marshall did not specify any country, but said that anyone who wants to enslave others for their own benefit will be met with fierce opposition from the United States. Marshall added: "In the next three or four years, Europe must obtain more assistance, otherwise, there will be economic and political collapse. The policy of the United States is not directed at any country or doctrine, but at poverty, famine, and turmoil. The United States must do its best to promote the economic recovery of the world, because without economic recovery, there can be no political stability, and without political instability, there can be no peace. Before the United States implements more assistance, European countries must reach an agreement on the needs of the situation to clarify their respective responsibilities." Finally, Marshall emphasized: "In Europe, an extremely serious situation is now rapidly developing, which is very unfavorable to the world. The failure to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian peace treaties has greatly slowed down the recovery."</p>
<h3>American Congressman Criticizes Soviet Interference in Hungary's Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The Senate continued to debate the peace treaties of the former German satellite states today. Senator Eastland, a right-wing senator from Mississippi, strongly protested the Soviet Union's making Hungary its "dependency" and advocated that United Nations agencies take action to maintain peace and guarantee the freedom of the Hungarian people. He also said that if the breakthrough is only to submit a protest, it will not appease the Soviet Union. Britain should take a positive stand and action, such as taking measures to expel the Soviet Union from the United Nations agencies. Finally, the Senate decided to make a final decision on the approval of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania tomorrow morning. It is said that Senator Tranmi Blythe, a Democrat from Arkansas, and many other senators are attempting to delay the approval of the peace treaty with Italy until January 25 next year, but it is expected that their strength will not be enough to prevent the passage of that peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Lu Chuan Discusses New Cabinet's Foreign Policy; Japan Covets Okinawa and Other Islands; American Banks Consider Lending to Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tokyo, 5th Broadcast: Japanese Foreign Minister Hidetoshi Ashida hosted foreign journalists today. He stated that Japan has no intention of rearming but only desires "to recover some small islands such as Iwo Jima and the Ryukyus." Ashida also said that Iwo Jima is not economically important to Japan, but the entire country "due to sentimental reasons" strongly desires to recover it. Regarding the peace treaty, Japan agrees to start negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Hidetoshi Ashida, in a meeting with reporters today, said: If the Allied nations allow Japan to have the necessary police force, equipped with machine guns and pistols, then the Japanese government will definitely be able to maintain public order and security after the signing of the peace treaty. "We have no intention of raising the issue of rearmament, because we have already abolished war under the new Constitution." When asked if the Japanese government is considering preventing aggression, Ashida replied: "We may rely on the United Nations, although we do not yet know whether the United Nations will immediately allow us to join after the signing of the peace treaty." Ashida also said that he does not yet know when preliminary peace talks will begin. So far, Japan has not had any meetings with representatives of the Allied nations on this issue. He stated that the Japanese government has made "full preparations" for the peace treaty proposals. In answering reporters' questions, Ashida said that territorial and economic issues may be one of the important items in future peace treaty negotiations. Japan's borders were determined long ago by the Potsdam Declaration, but there are still some islands, such as Okinawa, the Kuril Islands, the islands east of Hokkaido, and the small islands south of Kyushu, that have not been determined. Ashida also strongly insisted that the issue of reparations must be "realistically resolved." He pointed out that the German reparations settlement under the Treaty of Versailles after the last war was completely unrealistic.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Ashida emphasized when hosting foreign reporters today that Japan's greatest hope at present is to quickly enter into normal international relations. Ashida said: This is not only necessary in terms of world peace relations, but also for the revitalization of East Asia. It is also a new starting point for rebuilding friendly relations between China and Japan. Regarding the issue of reparations, he hopes to learn specific plans as soon as possible, such as what factories and what products will be used for reparations. Finally, when Ashida discussed the international situation, he believed that the most concerning US-Soviet war would not occur because there is no major issue between the US and the Soviet Union that cannot be resolved by means other than war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The issuers of the two banks willing to lend 50 million US dollars to Japan said today: This matter is still in an undecided state. A spokesperson for New York's Henry Schroder Bank, commenting on a New York Times Tokyo dispatch that the bank and the Bank of America in San Francisco had offered General MacArthur a loan of 50 million US dollars to Japan, said: The negotiations only discussed the nature of the loan, and the amount of the loan has not been determined. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Bank of America said: This news came about because various parties are trying to discuss ways to fund Japan's import and export business. All the facts are still in an undecided stage. According to a New York Times Tokyo dispatch: This loan is related to MacArthur's recent proposal that Japanese banks' gold be used as collateral to fund the import of various capital raw materials for Japan, because Japan's industry must increase some imports and exports.</p>

Also, Liberal Party President Shigeru Yoshida recently gave his first speech in his capacity as party president, saying: "Without an opposition party, there is no way to make progress. The reason why I formed a coalition cabinet with the Socialist Party and other political parties last year was because the situation at that time was very different from the current situation. Now Japan does not need a national unity cabinet."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Liberal Party Secretary-General and one of the labor leaders of the party, Banboku Ono, has resigned from his position as secretary-general to Yoshida.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 5th Broadcast: The seven major Indian leaders who accepted the Indian partition plan held a meeting with the Indian Governor-General today to discuss the establishment of a committee to study ways to establish two autonomous dominion nations.

Premier Zhang said that China is very interested in the development of India. India has a large area and complex ethnic groups, and the task of unification will inevitably be difficult. Regardless of the final solution plan, he personally hopes that the various ethnic groups and leaders of India can quickly complete cooperation in an effective way for the benefit of the entire India. He especially admires the United Kingdom's decision to hand over the Indian regime to the Indian people.</p>

The treatment is simple and most effective in controlling the entry of salt and water, and taking refined digitalis (i.e., digitoxin) and topical diuretics daily. It can be easily performed in hospitals or homes with minimal care and dietary maintenance.</p>
<h3>US and Argentina Decide to Establish Friendly Relations; Brighton's Resignation Approved; US Ambassador to Argentina May Also Resign</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] President Truman accepted the resignation of Under Secretary of State Brighton today, 24 hours after the United States decided to re-establish friendly relations with Argentina. Brighten had frankly criticized Argentina's policies and will step down at the end of this month. According to well-informed sources, there are two ways to fill the vacancy of Under Secretary of State. One is that Secretary of State Marshall will appoint a person with extensive diplomatic experience to preside over Brighton's Latin American policy and various political departments. The other is that Marshall will lead Assistant Secretary of State to directly handle non-Western Hemisphere affairs, and another new Under Secretary of State will be found to specialize in Latin American affairs. At the same time, the US Ambassador to Argentina, Messersmith, is in poor health and is expected to resign, bringing an end to the dispute between Messersmith and Brighten.</p>
<p>[United Press, Capital City of Argentina, 5th Dispatch] Argentina is very pleased with the news of the resignation of US Under Secretary of State Brighten, but officials are unwilling to express their opinions on the matter.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Bill; Decides to Restrict Union Activities; President's Attitude Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The US House of Representatives, believing that it can win against the president's possible veto, today passed the compromise union control legislation by a majority of 320 votes to 79, prohibiting unions from launching strikes, making the most thorough reform of labor law in the past 12 years. It is expected that the Senate will take final action on Thursday so that the bill can be delivered to the president for signature on Thursday evening or Friday. Taft of the Republican Policy Committee expects that the Senate will also pass the bill by an overwhelming majority in order to crush the president's veto power. If President Truman signs this labor law amendment, he will finally abandon the pro-labor policy left by Roosevelt's New Deal. He will also sacrifice labor votes in the next presidential election. The bill was finally drafted after several consultations between the Senate and the House of Representatives, which has removed many of the strict provisions of the original House of Representatives to restrict union activities, restoring a more moderate form, but is still stricter than the labor management plan that Truman submitted to Congress in January this year. American organized unions have already spent a lot of money to call on public opinion to oppose this bill.</p>

<h3>Passing Through Dangerous Waves; Senate Meeting Closes</h3>
<p>Speaker Thanks Authorities for Meticulously Maintaining Order; City Government's Administration Should Focus on Key Points and Construction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The third meeting of the first session of the City Council was held from the 26th of last month to discuss various proposals, review the city government's administrative report, determine the budget, and guide the student unrest. It lasted for ten days and closed at 8:45 pm yesterday. First, Speaker Shen gave a closing speech, which briefly stated: The third meeting of this council lasted for ten days. During the ten-day session, the council and various subcommittees fulfilled their respective responsibilities. During the meeting, Shanghai was also at its most tense moment in society. We had to discuss proposals on the one hand and take into account social dynamics, especially the student unrest issue. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the security authorities, the situation in Shanghai was transformed from unrest to stability. This is a very gratifying thing. The government authorities' meticulous efforts and the appropriateness of the response methods are worthy of praise from the citizens. Although we heard some parents of students occasionally criticize the authorities' measures, for the sake of the public's security and the protection of young people, we cannot but understand the government's measures. During this period, the Special Committee for Guiding Student Unrest of this council issued a message and went to various schools to guide, fully expressing the enthusiasm for protecting young people and the hope for young students. This point is also very comforting. The city's 30% budget re-compilation and comprehensive budget review have also been reviewed and approved, and it is recommended that the city government focus on key points and construction projects in future administration, and tighten up institutions. These points are all very important.</p>
<p>Efforts in Urban Planning</p>
<p>There are also resolutions on the Shanghai urban plan. Although the resolutions are not detailed enough, we are very ashamed, but the special committee of the council has done its best. In the future, a standing committee will be established, which can contribute even more to promote the implementation of this plan step by step. If we can build a metropolis according to plan now, our descendants will definitely benefit greatly in fifty years. As long as the entire country is unified and peaceful, the Shanghai urban plan will have many opportunities for development, whether by our own strength or with the assistance of international personnel. It can be completed according to our ideals in less than ten or eight years.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's speech at the closing ceremony of the City Council (photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Three Points in Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then gave a speech, saying that he had a few thoughts: (1) The proposals of this conference were concrete and the discussions were in-depth, which has benefited me a lot and made me feel the great responsibility of the city government even more, and I cannot but work harder. (2) Although the Shanghai urban plan seems to be just talk on paper now, if there had been a plan for the construction of Shanghai a hundred years ago, today's transportation and other issues would not be so chaotic. As the speaker said, as long as China can truly be peacefully unified, the urban plan can be completed within ten years. Otherwise, if Shanghai continues like this, future generations will blame us.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Cooperation of the Council</p>
<p>(3) Regarding public security, I am very grateful to the City Council for various guidance, so that this major difficulty can be overcome safely. Now that the matter has passed, but what I can report to you is that there was a great danger on June 2, thanks to the efforts of the military and police authorities and the Council that stability was achieved. As for the city government's arrest of students, it was by no means reckless. The list was drawn up very carefully. There are a total of 45,000 students in Shanghai. After a year of investigation, more than 80 people were identified, but due to many disadvantages after disclosure, it is not intended to be disclosed unless necessary. However, all the evidence is very solid. One of the students had participated in riots elsewhere, with evidence to prove it. Others publicly posted the charter of the "Anti-Japanese University" run by the Communist Party in their bedrooms and wanted to introduce classmates to apply to the school.</p>
<p>Rehabilitating the Arrested Students</p>
<p>Some people advocate sending the arrested students to court, but in order to protect young people, we did not send them to court, because after sending them to court, according to the evidence, both military law and judicial law can be convicted. These students are all promising young people of the country who are being used by others, so we do not use legal sanctions but emphasize humanity. We originally intended to send them to the CCP area, but in order to comply with the opinion of the City Council, we decided to keep them for rehabilitation, so that they can all become pillars of the country in the future.</p>
<h3>Leading with Justice; Serving the People</h3>
<p>Finally, Councilor Tao Baichuan, on behalf of the city councilors, said: I have one feeling about this conference, that is, we discuss proposals, from small to a school or a district, to large to the country, and the world. Someone mentioned that small matters do not need to spend a lot of time and solemnly discussed. But I believe that the Council should ask about and discuss big issues, and also ask about and discuss small issues. Both principles and techniques should be taken into account. The so-called "small things of the government are big things of the people". We believe that there is no lightness or heaviness. For each individual, it is a big deal. The Council represents justice and is a banner of justice. There is too little sense of justice in society today. We must exercise justice for the citizens, otherwise all plans and all proposals will become "just talk on paper". The colleagues of this council have this spirit and deserve to continue, with "small things of the government are big things of the people" as the premise, with "justice" as the guiding spirit, not afraid of difficulties, and serving the people.</p>
<h3>Amended and Passed Standards for Deferment of Conscription; Street Vendors' Illegal Goods Shall Not Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Shanghai Municipal Government's Standards for Deferment of Conscription for Sole Breadwinners of Families in 1947" drafted by the Municipal Government was submitted to the City Council by Speaker Pan. After discussion at yesterday's meeting, the following was resolved to be amended: (1) For those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families and have no siblings, the following items should be prepared: 1. Those who are responsible for the living of one or more family members; 2. Those whose average annual income per person is less than 6 Shi of rice (the same applies to those who have no land and whose other income is less than the value of the above-mentioned rice). (2) If there are two brothers, one of whom is disabled and has been approved for exemption from military service, and the livelihood of the whole family depends solely on one person, the standards for deferment shall apply to the provisions of Article 1.</p>
<p>Other cases submitted by the Speaker, which were discussed by the conference, included: (1) "Whether or not to respond to the Qingdao City Council's telegram, suggesting that the central government change councilors to salaried positions, and request discussion". Resolution: Retain. (2) "The second conference of the council, unresolved temporary motion: For street vendors who violate police regulations, their goods shall not be confiscated". Resolution: Send a letter to the municipal government ordering the police bureau that the goods of street vendors who violate police regulations shall not be confiscated, and shall be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on punishment of police violations. (3) "The unresolved motion of the second conference of the council: Regarding the case of private misconduct of garbage trucks transporting vegetable vendors in the Health Bureau, requesting a public decision". Resolution: Send a letter to the Health Bureau to strengthen management in the future to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Urban Plan; Establishment of a Standing Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Council discussed the "Shanghai Urban Plan" yesterday. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau reported the main points of the plan, followed by councilors expressing their opinions. Finally, it was passed: (1) The special committee for reviewing the case was changed to a standing committee to facilitate progress. (2) Supplementary opinions, that is, Shi Bangfan's request to pay attention to coordinating with national defense, and Jiang Huaishu's request to coordinate with the Eastern Port plan. (3) Add Shi Bangfan, Zhu Fujiu, Jiang Huaishu, Wang Ziyang, and Zhang Yuliang as members of the special committee. (4) Xi Yuyu suggested that Nanhui Chuansha be included in the urban area, and if other councilors have any opinions, they should be submitted to the committee for discussion after the special committee is established. Also, regarding the case of "requesting the municipal government to return to the original site", it was also resolved to be submitted to the committee for discussion. In addition, the "Provisional Regulations on the Location of Factories in Shanghai" was passed by the conference in principle, and the amendment of the articles was submitted to the special committee for review.</p>
<h3>Administrative Review Report; Amend the Wording for Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Council's review report on the city government's administration has also been generally passed, and Li Wenjie, Tao Baichuan, and Zhu Wende were selected to amend the report's wording for submission to the city government for handling. In addition, 53 important resolutions of various committees during the adjournment of the second conference have also been retrospectively passed by the conference. In addition, regarding legal regulations, the city government submitted to the council for review nine kinds of the city's various tax collection rules and audit methods. The conference resolved that the legal regulations and finance committees, after considering the opinions of the councilors, would deliberate and submit them to the next conference for retrospective approval.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Term Deposits; Please Set a Repayment Method</h3>
<p>Suggest the Central Government Consider Reorganizing Old Public Bonds</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the final stage of yesterday's meeting, Zhuang Ping and others raised a temporary motion: "It is recommended that the central government stipulate a method for repaying term deposits absorbed before the war and implement it quickly to protect national assets." The original method suggested that the central government repay according to the current cost of living index. Some councilors and Vice Speaker Xu advocated retaining it, but the original proposers opposed it. As a result, it was resolved to cancel the method of following the cost of living index and petition the central government to stipulate a repayment method. At the same time, Wang Weiyi, Shao Yongsheng, and others insisted that the public bond case should also not be retained. After the resolution, it was: "It is recommended that the central government consider reorganizing old public bonds."</p>
<p>In addition, several temporary motions were passed: (1) "Please instruct the first district office to move to the original site of the Civil Affairs Office for office work as soon as possible to facilitate work and correct appearances." (2) "Please instruct the municipal government to take back the public property of the French Concession and allocate it to Jiangwan District and Gaoqiao District for the development of education funds". Resolution: Send it to the municipal government for consideration. (3) "Please instruct the Public Utilities Bureau to distinguish between three-wheeled vehicles transporting goods and private vehicles in accordance with business vehicle licenses to maintain the livelihood of three-wheeled vehicle towing workers, distinguish work, and avoid disputes". Resolution: Send it to the Public Utilities Bureau for consideration.</p>
<h3>Lou Guowei Goes to Beijing and Does Not Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Lou Guowei, director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, was originally scheduled to attend the council again yesterday to continue the report, but because Lou was summoned to Beijing yesterday morning, he did not attend.</p>
<h3>The Index Cannot Be Issued Honestly; Disputes in Various Industries Fluctuate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the publication of the May cost of living index, most capitalists expressed that they could not issue it honestly, especially in the machinery, casting, and electrical industries. The Machinery Industry Association also notified its members to issue according to the April index, but the profit and loss situation of each factory is different, so some have reached an agreement and some are still deadlocked. Yesterday afternoon, both labor and capital went to the Social Affairs Bureau to state their difficulties and are being mediated by the bureau.</p>
<p>Machinery Industry in the Fourth District</p>
<p>The district includes 40 manufacturers, of which 23 have decided to issue 23,500 times in one lump sum or in installments. The remaining Zhongxing, Yuanfeng, Samsung, Qiujing, Chen Xingji, Shanghai Zhengji, Huangpu and other factories said that they would still only issue 14,800 times. Labor and capital are still in dispute. China Textile Machinery Company recently caused workers to strike over the index. Under the mediation of Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided to issue 70% according to 23,500 times first, and the rest will be negotiated again. The workers expressed satisfaction and have returned to normal.</p>
<p>Machinery Industry in the Seventh District</p>
<p>Because the capitalists all issued according to the association's notification of 14,800 times, the workers specially sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, claiming that if it could not be resolved, it might cause a strike.</p>
<p>Tailoring Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the tailoring industry, the seamstresses of 13 companies including Nanjing West Road's Peiqi, Cairo, Wuxingchang Ruji, Zhaofeng, Wanhexing, Kailin, Longmao, Raymond, Radar, Peimeng, Youlian, Hengtai, and Guangming went on strike because the capitalists did not agree to pay according to the index.</p>
<p>Also, the capitalists in the machinery industry met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting to change the basic salary, which was rejected by Director Wu, who believed that the basic salary had been set. If it is changed now, it will only cause disputes. At present, we can only think of ways to appropriately increase working hours or discount from the basic salary.</p>
<h3>Public Buses of the Transportation Company Once Went on Strike and Then Resumed; The Two Demands Were Resolved After Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The public buses of lines 1 to 11 of the Public Transportation Company under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau went on strike yesterday morning and did not fully resume operation until 11:00 am.</p>
<p>Because the company is a business agency of the municipal government, all employees' salaries are based on the treatment of public education personnel. In addition to the current 340,000 yuan, the basic salary is calculated at 1,800 times, plus a business bonus of 40%. Since the publication of the May cost of living index, more than 700 drivers and ticket sellers of the company gathered to discuss at 11:00 pm the night before and decided to demand two items from the authorities: (1) Issue in accordance with the existing basic salary and the cost of living index. (2) Implement an 8-hour work system. After hearing the news, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau rushed to consult that night. The workers insisted on the request, which was not resolved until yesterday morning. All the drivers and ticket sellers gathered at the trade union at 959 Gongping Road waiting for a reply and did not go to work, causing all buses on each line to be suspended. At around 9 o'clock, Director Zhao went to consult again. Regarding the salary issue, because the Public Transportation Company is not a private enterprise, it is still treated as civil servants, and it is also allowed to be allocated in kind. Everything is handled in accordance with the municipal government's regulations, and it is promised to issue a difference between the market price of the allocated items and the market price of the allocated items, which is 300,000 yuan per person before the actual items are received. All the workers were satisfied and immediately went to work in each army. The vehicles on each line came out of the factory and ran as usual.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Index Issue: Wu Kaixian's Remarks on Establishing Unified and Flexible Measures, Which Seem Impossible in the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Wu yesterday addressed the labor unrest caused by the unfreezing of the index, stating: The government should certainly consider the difficulties faced by the industrial sector. However, establishing unified and flexible measures seems impossible because the prosperity and decline vary across industries, and the production and business conditions of each factory within those industries also differ. Those who can still afford it should continue to issue wages according to the stipulated index. For those who genuinely face difficulties, adjustments should be made based on their specific circumstances. Forcing uniformity would only create obstacles and make things difficult. Therefore, if factories truly cannot afford to pay wages according to the index, they should resolve the issue individually, through negotiations between labor and management to agree on discounted payments or extend working hours as compensation. It is hoped that each factory will submit this issue for discussion at factory meetings, and the factory should also make its production costs and business conditions as transparent as possible to enhance understanding between labor and management and overcome the difficulties together. When the government announced the freezing of the workers' cost of living index in February, all the workers in the city uniformly complied, hoping that prices would not rise further. This spirit is highly commendable. For two, three, and four months, there were no complaints. Now, because prices continue to soar, causing real hardship for workers, the government has established new wage adjustment measures. At the same time, it has also considered the situation of the production sector. Therefore, in addition to discounts, the measures also include Article 5, which stipulates that if businesses genuinely cannot afford it, labor and management can negotiate a reduction. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be submitted to the Labor-Management Arbitration Board for a fair decision. The government has already provided detailed measures. Now, some union branches do not know how to properly guide the factories to implement these measures separately, enabling each factory and union to negotiate openly and honestly. Instead, they are using other impractical methods, which only increase disturbances and cannot solve the problem, which is truly inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Xue Gengxin and Jiang Hongjie: Re-trial Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Xue Gengxin, a key member of the puppet police bureau suspected of being a traitor, was heard for the third time at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Xue argued that he was working underground while serving in the police bureau, and He Shizhen, the former president of Chizhi College, and Hu Qi, an underground worker, testified in court, all in favor of the defendant. After the court hearing, due to the need for further investigation, a retrial was scheduled.</p>
<p>Also, Jiang Hongjie, the former Minister of Transportation of the puppet Provisional Government, was tried for the first time in the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant tried his best to defend his past crimes. After a long hearing, due to the need for further investigation, a retrial was scheduled.</p>
<h3>Summons Witnesses in the Fubo Ship Case: Passengers to be Questioned on the 17th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In addition to the previous trial of the defendant Dai Rulin in the Fubo ship tragedy, it has now been decided to reopen the trial in the Second Criminal Court at 9:30 AM on the 17th of this month. The defendant Dai Rulin will not be brought in for questioning, but only passengers of the Haimin ship, Luo Qian, Li Chunlin, Jiang Jixin, Li Xiuming, and Lin Ruwen, will be summoned to testify in court. The summonses were sent out yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Investigate the Corrupt Practices of Foreign Workers in Vegetable Markets, etc., by Organizing a Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There have long been corrupt practices involving foreign workers in the city's vegetable markets, fish markets, etc., with commissions ranging from three to five percent. When the Agricultural and Forestry Cooperation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau recently convened a meeting with representatives of vegetable vendors, etc., it was decided to establish a Foreign Workers Investigation Committee, consisting of one representative each from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Party Headquarters, and three representatives each from the Vegetable Vendor Mutual Aid Association and the vegetable market authorities. The committee will investigate the general situation in various industries in society. If only a few industries have this corrupt practice, it will be banned. If most industries have it, it will be handled uniformly.</p>
<h3>Reverend Zhang Yilin Passed Away</h3>
<p>Reverend Zhang Yilin, a veteran Methodist minister, passed away due to a cerebral hemorrhage at 11:30 AM on June 4th, at the age of 77. During his lifetime, Zhang preached in Wuxing, Zhejiang, and Jinglin Church in Shanghai for more than 30 years, dedicating himself to supervising the ministry. His remains will be laid to rest today at 3:00 PM in the Shanghai Funeral Home, following a Christian ceremony of repose. The remains will be moved to the Hongqiao Cemetery on Hongqiao Road for burial at 4:00 PM on the same day.</p>
<h3>Acting Dean of the Law School Visits Detained Students: Miss Qu Yuan Burst Into Tears, Saying She Was Bored to Death Without Books and Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Because of a brawl among students at the Shanghai Law School, the District Prosecutor's Office completed its investigation, and Qu Yuan and eleven others were indicted on charges of assault. The District Court decided that Judge Wu Jiazu would open the trial next week. However, among the defendants in this case, except for four whose circumstances were less serious and who have been released on bail, there are still seven, including Qu Yuan, who are currently detained. There have been rumors recently that Qu Yuan has become emaciated and died in prison. Chu Fengyi, the acting dean of the school, went to the District Court to inquire about the matter and, with the permission of Judge Cha, accompanied by Sun Heng, the chief of the Criminal Records Section, visited the detained students at the Masnan Road Detention Center. They entered at 5:00 PM and left around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Warden Tian of the detention center, Chu Fengyi and Sun, the head of the section, first went to Qu Yuan's cell. Miss Qu was combing her hair, wearing a floral silk cheongsam, and was small in stature. When she saw her teacher arrive, she bowed deeply at 90 degrees, tears welling up in her eyes. Dean Chu comforted her, saying, "Don't cry. The court is now hearing the case, and everything should follow legal procedures." Miss Qu said, "I hope the trial starts soon. I don't have any books or newspapers to read here." Warden Tian interjected, "Yes, as long as your family sends them, we will forward them to you immediately." Dean Chu said, "Do you have enough clothes? Are you cold? Are you sleeping comfortably?" Qu said, "It's okay, I just feel bored." At this point, she started crying again. After Dean Chu comforted her for a while, they went to the other students' cells one by one to comfort them. They did not leave the detention center until around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The United States Respects Our Country's Judiciary</h3>
<p>An American Youth Files for Divorce in His Own Country; His Wife in Shanghai Asks Our Court to Serve as Agent for Transmission</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] An American youth, Lao Baituo (male), and Pai Tuolixiya (female), married in Shanghai on April 27, 1946, and returned to New York. Soon after, Lao discovered that Pai was having an affair with another man. Pai came to Shanghai alone in November 1946. Lao filed a complaint against his wife in the local court of Oulai, a major city in New York, seeking a divorce. The case was later transferred to the New York High Court. However, the female party is being tried in Shanghai. According to international law, if one party is in their own country and the other party is in another country, the laws of the other country should be respected, and the notification of the trial should be issued by that country. On the 3rd of this month, the US Consul General in Shanghai, Stevens, sent a letter to the city's local court requesting that the notification from the American court be delivered to the female party. If Pai does not return to the US within 20 days, the divorce will be finalized. This is the first case of a foreign country respecting our country's judiciary.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Ship Transports Siamese Rice: Stored in Kowloon and Then Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Xing Company's Fuxing ship, loaded with foreign rice from Siam on the 7th of last month, ran aground near Turtle Island in the Xiamen Sea. Fortunately, the bow of the ship floated, and the rice that was not submerged was unloaded by Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. According to the company, the rice unloaded by the Yongsheng ship has been transported and stored in Kowloon and will soon be transferred to Shanghai. Efforts are being made to pump water from the front cabin, and there is hope of salvaging the ship once the water can be removed.</p>
<h3>Hualian Ship Regularly Travels on the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Taiwan Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The excellent passenger ship Hualian, previously purchased by the China United Enterprise Company in Australia for the Shanghai-Tianjin line, went to Sydney for repairs at the end of last year. The work was completed at the end of April of this year, and it has sailed to Tianjin several times. Recently, to develop the Qingdao and Taiwan lines, the company has designated the Hualian ship to exclusively sail the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Taiwan lines, with a scheduled departure every five days. It is scheduled to make its first voyage to Qingdao on the 11th of this month and will directly depart from Shanghai to an empty Kowloon on the 16th. The Meiqi General, an American postal ship that arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Wage Discounts Above 100 Yuan Can Be Agreed Upon by Each Factory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai wage adjustment measures passed by the National Price Conference stipulated that the amount of base salary between 30 yuan and 100 yuan should be divided into levels of 10 yuan each, with a 10% discount for each level. However, it was not specified how to calculate the amount above 100 yuan. Wu Kaixian, the head of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Social Affairs for clarification. He received a reply from Minister Gu yesterday, stating that the original measures did not specify discounts for base salaries above 100 yuan. This is because there are very few workers in this category, and they are mostly senior technicians with important positions and a significant impact on the future of production. Therefore, discounts for the portion above 100 yuan should be determined by each factory, with labor and management agreeing on the provisions based on their circumstances, which would be more appropriate. If there are disputes, they should be submitted to the Labor-Management Arbitration Board for a decision.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Production Promotion Association Assists in Transporting National Products to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>In order to develop trade in Southeast Asia, the Shanghai branch of the China Production Promotion Association has conducted surveys of the production and sales conditions of its member manufacturers, as well as the sales conditions in Southeast Asia, in order to expand trade in Southeast Asia. This is currently underway. Recently, Li Zhifu, the commercial commissioner stationed in Singapore by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, telegraphed that hot water bottles, enamelware, glassware, cotton yarn, and other goods produced in the city are very popular in Southeast Asia and should be shipped south as soon as possible. Before the war, the number of goods shipped from Shanghai to Southeast Asia each year was extremely large, and the foreign exchange recovered was quite substantial. After the victory, overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia repeatedly telegraphed to order goods, but due to control regulations, some goods could not be freely transported and sold to Southeast Asia, which greatly affected the business of manufacturers. Recently, overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia have successively telegraphed to urge the shipment of these goods. The association has decided to assist manufacturers in transporting and selling them to various parts of South China.</p>

<h3>Three Cases of False Accusations of Counterfeiting Legal Tender Have Occurred</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 7:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, two armed men, accompanied by three men in long gowns, went to the third floor of Rongkang Rice Store at 724 Guangdong Road, falsely accusing resident Lu Ronghui (38 years old, from Suzhou, formerly a teacher at Shangzhi Elementary School) of counterfeiting legal tender. They took Lu away and later detained him at a certain place in a chartered car. His wife, Zang, reported the information to the Laozha Police Station, and the station ordered the police to cooperate with the inspection team of the Weihaiwei Road Garrison Headquarters to investigate, but they could not find any clues. By 10:00 PM that night, the Laozha Branch received a report that someone was illegally detaining people in Room 23 of the Yipinxing Hotel. They dispatched police officers to the scene and found three men in plain clothes, Xu Yuchun, Liu Jinsheng, and Yang Yanzhu (these three were the ones who arrested Lu Ronghui). They were accusing Xia Guanshun of counterfeiting legal tender. The police took everyone back to the station for questioning. Xu and others confessed to falsely accusing Xia of counterfeiting legal tender in order to extort money. They also admitted that they were the ones who arrested Lu Ronghui that morning. The branch then submitted the case to the Garrison Headquarters for handling. It was also learned that on the 2nd, armed men and men in plain clothes went to a certain house in Shizi Lane in Nanshi to look for Yang Zhen, taking the opportunity to falsely accuse him of using counterfeit money. Yang was not there, so they took away a woman holding a baby. Whether this was also done by Xu and others is still unclear. It was also learned that Lu Ronghui was released at 11:00 AM yesterday and went to the Laozha Police Station at around 3:00 PM to report the incident.</p>
<h3>Zhang Bingdu and Others Submit Evidence to Deny Allegations of Corrupt Practices</h3>

They have submitted all relevant documents to the court.</p>
<h3>Harassing a Female Waitress: Six Tourists Injured</h3>

Wang gathered seventy or eighty people armed with iron bars and knives and chased after them to the entrance of the Tongshang Hotel on Beijing West Road, severely beating Chen Guangming and stabbing him in the left waist, causing him to fall to the ground. Shen Jinchun and others fled to the Shanghai Grand Theater on Xizang Road and the Xiangsheng Car Company on Beijing Road, where they were also chased and beaten.

<h3>Enlarged Investigation of the Jin Chao Case: Bei Zuyi Interrogated; Conference Hall Used as a Court; Repeatedly Called Reporters "Old Friends"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office has expanded its investigation into the Jin Chao case, which has caused a national sensation. Yesterday, it summoned Bei Zuyi, the former Governor of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, the former director and deputy director of the Business Bureau, Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and cashier director, and Zhan Liansheng, the chairman of the Gold Industry Association who is in custody, to court to investigate the "disruption of finance." At 9:05 AM yesterday morning, Bei Zuyi arrived at the District Prosecutor's Office in a green private car accompanied by lawyer Duanmu Qi. Bei was wearing a gray suit. When he got out of the car, the cameras were busy taking pictures. Bei did not go to the registration room as usual, but went directly to the reception room on the third floor of the office to wait. The conference hall was then used as a court. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Ding Fu'en and Clerk Situ Bihua began the interrogation, which was very detailed. The interrogation ended at 11:20 AM. When Bei came downstairs, the cameras of the photographers were busy again. Reporters stood at the car door and asked him to express his feelings about the interrogation. Bei repeatedly smiled and said, "We are all old friends, old friends." He refused to express any opinions.</p>
<p>Lin Yang Wang and Others: Summoned One After Another</p>
<p>Lin, Yang, and Wang registered at the registration room at 9:00 AM and sat in the waiting room. Lin Fengbao was wearing a gray suit and pacing back and forth, sometimes resting his chin in his hand and sitting silently, looking rather anxious. Yang Anren was wearing a light gray suit and repeatedly said, "This matter is due to a misunderstanding." Wang Songtao was wearing a floral long gown and looked relatively calm. Lin was interrogated from 11:20 AM to 1:00 PM, Yang from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and Wang from around 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. All four were ordered to return home and left one after another. Zhan Liansheng was still wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket, sitting alone in a room. Because it was late, he was not interrogated and was scheduled to be investigated this morning. He was still sent back to the District Court for detention.</p>
<p>According to sources from relevant parties, because the case is attracting national attention, the District Prosecutor's Office has expanded its investigation in order to thoroughly understand the truth, summoning people related to the case in order to get to the bottom of it. Yesterday's investigation focused on who was responsible for the gold rush, such as the amount of gold sold through open and covert channels, who decided the gold price, the reason for the discrepancy between the amount of gold allocated by the Central Bank and Tong Fengyu, and whether there was collusion between officials and merchants to manipulate speculative gold trading, and so on. Lin, Yang, and Zhan, the three defendants, have already been tried in the District Court. As for whether Bei and Wang are guilty, it cannot be determined at this time. Because the case is complex, it is still necessary to periodically summon people related to the case for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Expenditure Departments: Additional Budget Approved; Totaling More Than 79.2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The re-edited and additional budget for the expenditure portion of the Municipal Government's general budget for the 36th year was passed by the City Council yesterday according to the review report. Several resolutions were also made: (1) Please Municipal Government pay attention to key points in future administration to save expenses. (2) The Municipal Government should submit additional budgets to the Council for review first in the future. (3) In order to strengthen the organization of the Budget Committee, at least one member of each of the other committees should participate in the discussions when the committee holds meetings in the future. The budget report was presented by City Councilor Li Wenjie yesterday, stating: (1) The income portion of the re-edited budget was completely listed in accordance with the amounts passed by the Council, totaling: Ordinary income, regular items, more than 184.3 million yuan, temporary items, more than 58.4 billion yuan, totaling more than 242.8 billion yuan. (2) The expenditure portion: Originally offset against income, but after the Municipal Government added three budgets, totaling more than 79.4 billion yuan (including new construction costs, clearing accumulated garbage, police subsidies, aerial surveys, firefighter subsidies, police subsidies, living subsidies for various units, repairing 500 dung carts, and building 50 public restrooms). After review, it was deemed that the dung cart repair fee of more than 100 million yuan should be included in the Health Bureau's temporary fee for purchasing and repairing equipment. After deducting this amount, the additional budget totaled more than 79.2 billion yuan. Therefore, the total expenditure is more than 322 billion yuan. If the excess collection of various taxes from January to April is used to make up for the deficit, more than 62.7 billion yuan can be obtained, so the deficit is more than 16.4 billion yuan. However, there are also deficits for various bureaus outside the budget (listed by the Municipal Government as an appendix to the re-edited budget), totaling more than 129.6 billion yuan, which have not been reviewed. If they need to be formally listed in the future, the Municipal Government should compile them into an additional budget and submit them to the Council for review.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Rejects Subsidy Funding, National Games May Be Postponed, Hao Gengsheng Comes to Shanghai to Convene Preparatory Committee for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Because the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the 4th rejected the 2 billion yuan subsidy for the National Games, Hao Gengsheng took the noon train to Shanghai on the 5th to consult with Mayor Wu, and will convene the Standing Committee of the National Games Preparatory Committee to discuss whether Shanghai will find a way to fund the National Games on its own, or make other plans.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The National Games, scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Day this year, will now be declared postponed indefinitely. The Executive Yuan had previously approved the subsidy for the National Games, but has now changed its mind. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan decided to stop the funding in accordance with the policy of tightening expenditures.</p>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] Hao Gengsheng, Director-General of the Preparatory Committee of the 7th National Games and Physical Education Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 3:30 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the same day. According to Hao, he came to Shanghai to report on the progress of the National Games to the Preparatory Committee. Hao consulted with the relevant authorities last night and scheduled to host a press conference for sports reporters from all newspapers in Shanghai at the City Gymnasium Conference Room at 3:30 PM this afternoon to make a public report.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The 7th National Games, originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Day this year, may be postponed due to unresolved funding issues. On the 4th of this year, the Executive Yuan had approved a subsidy of 1 billion yuan for the National Games. At the first preparatory meeting held in Liuzhao at the beginning of last month, the competition rules of the Games were approved, and the budget was listed as 12 billion yuan. Wu Guozhen, director of the preparatory committee, hoped that the central government could subsidize half of the amount. After several consultations by the committee, the budget was tightened and it was decided to request the central government to subsidize 2 billion yuan. During the debate on the issue at yesterday's administrative meeting, it was decided not to add to the budget, as the fifth item of the National Games's holding method stipulates that if the Games are held in a province or city, the funding shall be borne by the local government. Therefore, whether the Games can be held as scheduled depends on whether the Shanghai authorities can bear the cost of the Games.</p>

<h3>Import Quotas for the Second Quarter; Import Management Committee Considers Relaxation; Generally Increase by 30% Based on the Original Quota</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Import Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee has already considered relaxing the quotas for certain types of imports in the second quarter, generally increasing by 30% based on the original quota. It is known that the import quotas that have been relaxed include white newsprint in the paper category, which has been increased to US$2,595,000. In terms of wood pulp, the quota for the National Resources Commission Paper Mill remains at US$100,000, while the quota for private paper mills has been increased to US$625,000. The quota for cigarette paper has been increased to US$780,000. The quota for other types of paper has been increased to US$520,000. For all types of quota imports of the committee, Shanghai accounts for approximately 70% to 80% of the allocation ratio, while the rest is allocated to other cities. However, fertilizer is an exception, as there is a greater need in South China. The committee has completed the allocation of quotas for extra-quota cotton in the second quarter. It will be announced as soon as it is approved by the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee. Regarding the import allocation of rubber, a consultation meeting with manufacturers in the industry will be held next week before a decision is made. The results of the allocation of wool quotas are insufficient. The committee is currently consulting with the authorities on ways to make accommodations so that those in the industry who have their own foreign exchange can import wool from abroad to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<h3>Statement on the Declaration of the Five County Cloth Factories, the Textile Management Committee Issues a Statement, The Committee Has Never Directly Distributed Yarn to the Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee stated yesterday that the "Respectful Announcement to All Sectors" issued by the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Associations of Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, and Jiangyin counties on the 3rd of this month contains inconsistencies with the facts regarding the committee's involvement. He issued the following statement:</p>
<p>He stated: "This committee has never directly distributed yarn to the replicating factories. However, from August 30th of last year, it supervised national and private yarn factories to hold four phases of joint sales of cotton yarn. The first phase was from August 30th to September 18th of last year, distributing a total of 25,779 pieces of yarn. The second phase was from September 23rd to October 18th of last year, distributing a total of 17,966 pieces of yarn. The third phase was from October 28th to November 21st of last year, distributing a total of 19,842 pieces of yarn. The fourth phase was from December 2nd of last year to January 6th of this year, distributing a total of 18,208 pieces of yarn."</p>
<p>The above four phases of yarn distribution were carried out by national and private yarn factories through the Replicating Industry Association to the replicating factories. From January 1st of this year, it was felt that the joint sales system was not effective, so it was abolished. From January 1st of this year, the committee changed to purchasing half of the yarn produced by each factory based on its cotton inventory. The remaining half was sold freely by the factories. The half of the cotton yarn purchased was sold by the committee through the Textile Construction Company in accordance with the company's original method. The committee has never interfered with the Textile Construction Company's business methods. This statement is issued because the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Associations of the five counties are unclear about the matter."</p>
<p>Review of Northern Transport of Yarn and Cloth Nearing Completion</p>
<p>In addition, the committee's review of the qualifications of manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to Hebei and Northeast ports can be concluded soon. Once approved by Chairman Wu, the number of approved companies will be announced. Regarding the matter of abolishing the method of transporting yarn and cloth to Hankou, Director Liu of the Business Department of the committee discussed it with Minister Chen Zhishi of the Ministry of Economic Affairs during his trip to Beijing. Minister Chen indicated that he could consider revising the method and changing it to allow industry associations to issue certificates proving the transshipment.</p>
<h3>Gauze Market Shows Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gauze market experienced a loosening of monetary conditions, attracting interest from outside the industry. Dyeing and weaving factories seized the opportunity to actively purchase, and out-of-town merchants also showed good appetite, leading to a buoyant market atmosphere. 42-count Blue Phoenix gauze reached a final high of 13 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse gauze was priced at 8.65 million yuan, and Double Horse gauze at 7.85 million yuan, both rising by 250,000 yuan. Other coarser gauzes such as 31-count and 20-count/16-count also increased by varying amounts of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market also showed some strength. In fine cloth, only the leading Five Blessings, Blue Chicken, and Colored Ball brands saw a slight decrease of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Zhenzhong, Yongzi, and Wanglong three brands rose by 10,000 yuan. High-grade 190 Chick muslin soared by 30,000 yuan per piece, and Yitong also performed well, rising by about 10,000 yuan. Dyed cloth, twill, bleached cloth, serge, and poplin all trended firm. The Textile Construction Company opened sales for 30 types of cloth, and prices were also stable.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Abundant Spring Cocoon Harvest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th] This year's spring cocoon harvest in Zhejiang Province has been abundant. The Xin'an-Shengxian and Hangzhou areas are about to conclude their season, while the Huzhou area has not yet entered the market. The Jiaxing area has the highest production. As of the 4th, the total amount collected in various areas has reached over 70,000 dan, and it is expected that 100,000 dan can be collected. Loans have been issued to various areas, including 45 billion to the Hangzhou area, 50 billion to Jiaxing, over 3 billion to Xin'an-Shengxian, and over 4 billion to Huzhou. However, the loans are insufficient for distribution. In addition to making every effort to continue lending, the China Sericulture Company has telegraphed the four major banks, requesting a rapid increase in loans.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] The spring cocoon season in Zhejiang Province is coming to an end, and some cocoon exchanges have gradually stopped weighing. Jiaxing area is later, but it should all be completed within ten days. Existing loans expended are already at 110 billion, but Jiaxing area needs more funds, the Province has urgently telegraphed the Capitol and Shanghai, in order to arrange for funds to be transferred in the fastest way to Hangzhou, because Jiaxing has too much arrears of funds for cocoons, triggering widespread disturbances.</p>
<p>Cocoon Exchanges Open Across Regions</p>
<p>The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economy, in view of the fact that cocoon exchanges in various parts of Jiangsu have all opened on the previous day and it is currently the peak season for cocoon collection, in order to understand the actual local situation and loan status, the Chairman of the Committee Tan Xihong and Standing Committee Member Tang Xixiang, left for Wuxi from the Capitol and Shanghai yesterday morning, respectively, and then went to Suzhou and Wujiang to conduct a comprehensive inspection of important silk-producing areas. The trip is expected to last about three days.</p>
<h3>Priority Processing of Rice Distribution for Qualified Applicants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Food Allocation Committee headquarters are still under renovation. Before the establishment of the committee, all matters will be temporarily handled by the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The distribution of rice to trade unions and schools in the city has resulted in many applicants, cumbersome review procedures, and a shortage of staff. Therefore, although some notification letters have been issued, rice has not yet been received.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, feeling that the processing was too slow, yesterday specifically ordered the Food Section to stop reviewing applications from today and to prioritize the distribution of rice to those who have passed the review. Wu, also the concurrent chairman of the Allocation Committee, specifically convened the Standing Committee members of the committee Zhang Xiaosong, Ren Xianqun, Ye Baofu, and the director of the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Grain Department Ye Xinming, the chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau Ji Mingzhai, etc., to hold a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:30 pm today to discuss the progress of the Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Stable, Miscellaneous Grains Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets together received more than 6,900 shi of rice and grain. In the North market, the influx of goods led to sluggish sales, and both japonica and indica rice saw a decline of 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. White silver dollars were used to increase sales volume. The South market was still tight in the early morning, but slackened at noon, with similar results. Indica rice was traded thinly, showing a slight softening, while white silver dollars remained firm, and out-of-town silver dollars saw lackluster absorption.</p>
<p>Flour prices showed mixed gains and losses. Foreign flour fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and factory flour also fell by a little over 1,000 yuan, but the bottom-grade sifted flour was still active, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran saw increased actual sales inland, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was actively traded in Shantou, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. After consecutive declines, stores seized the opportunity to stock up, and digestion turned abundant, with the situation weakening and then recovering.</p>
<p>Raw oil and soybean oil rebounded by over 10,000 yuan. Clear oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil showed slight strength, temporarily forming a sideways pattern. Red beans were sluggish and depressed, gradually decreasing by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were the most sluggish, falling sharply by 10,000 yuan. Sorghum trading turned lukewarm, falling sharply by 10,000 yuan. Corn trading was suspended in Qingdao, Beiyang, and Tianjin, plummeting by 20,000 yuan.

Ten-cigarette Great Britain fell slightly to 6.4 million yuan, a further decline of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Old Knife at 5.49 million yuan, also fell by 160,000 yuan. Five-flower Hardman and Two-Married Feet were relatively firm, with prices recovering by 20,000 to 100,000 yuan, while other Chinese and American strip cigarettes had mixed gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Improve, Slightly Weak at Close</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday, because the environment after the previous night's meeting seemed to show a glimmer of dawn, turned to be lively. However, due to over-speculation, the liveliness was ultimately unsustainable, and at the close, it suddenly reported weakness. Currently, deferred trading saw Yongsha between 300 yuan and 380 yuan, Xinyi between 130 yuan and 170 yuan, small stocks from 6.5 yuan to 11 yuan, and interest-included prices from 18 fen to 24 fen. This is because fluctuations arise repeatedly and the current account balance has decreased, making arbitrage more convenient.</p>
<p>The opening was stable. Stocks were already stable. The opening of Yongsha was much higher, and the deferred delivery of Yongsha became brisk. After the opening, No. 2, No. 224, No. 226, No. 85, No. 231, No. 218, No. 24, and No. 185 came in, while No. 104 and No. 188 vigorously purchased spot Yongsha, so the deferred delivery of Yongsha soon reached the daily limit. The dark market also called high to the 7,000 yuan mark, and Lian, Datong, Jinglun, and China Silk all reported daily limits. No. 157, No. 177, No. 76, and No. 23 took advantage of the high price to sell within 6,800 yuan, and No. 224, No. 226, No. 190, No. 148, No. 75, No. 28, and No. 22 entered again to above 6,900 yuan. No. 154, No. 200, No. 36, No. 223, No. 180, and No. 212 disposed of stock, and No. 201 also sold for immediate delivery, and dropped to within 6,700 yuan. No. 76, No. 99, and No. 22 took advantage of the situation to continue to enter, and No. 112 also took delivery of immediate delivery Yongsha, so deferred delivery Yongsha rebounded to 6,870 yuan. Spot Yongsha reached above 6,500 yuan. Afterwards, although No. 202 absorbed from time to time, No. 99, No. 171, No. 12, No. 152, No. 153, No. 142, and scattered investors successively shorted, and the excess longs mutually trampled on each other at noon, deferred delivery Yongsha fell to a low price of 6,500 yuan. Under the support of No. 117, No. 204, etc., Xinguang eagerly returned to the top, and Yongsha also showed some stability, ending the close with a consolidating pattern. The result compared to the previous close was that Yongsha and Zhongfa rose slightly, Yonggong was still flat, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhua fell slightly, Zhongsi and Jinglun had some return after the daily limit, each rising half a percent, Datong had some return after the daily limit, falling back half a percent, Lian had no return after the daily limit, only reporting a slight rise, Xinya fell by one percent, Guohuo, Zhongfang, and Tongyi were all flat, Underwear fell slightly, and Rongfeng, Yongni, and Commerce rose slightly. Deferred delivery stocks Yongsha rose to the daily limit and then had some return, rising slightly more than Yonggong by half a percent, Xinguang, Xinyi, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing all reported slight gains, and all the old stocks outside the field rebounded slightly except for Wuzhou, which did not show any improvement.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Initially High Then Low, Foreign Stock Trading Still Low</h3>
<p>Government bonds yesterday, series C initially high then low, opened in the morning at 13,800 yuan. From 13,900 yuan, the market fell to 12,900 yuan, and then rebounded slightly, finally stabilizing at 13,000 yuan. Rooms 555, 551, and 360 were selling, while rooms 208 and 503 were entering, the result still fell 300 yuan short of the previous close. Series E was the most colorful, rising alone by 500 yuan, series A and B rose by 200 yuan, series D only rose by 100 yuan, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan. There is a vague saying of multiple repayments of principal, the trend is uncertain.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks yesterday still traded little, still followed Chinese stocks to advance and retreat. Retail investors first entered and then exited, and gold merchants absorbed a little, but Hesheng sold some. Yisha opened in the morning at 67,000 yuan, Hong Kong-Shanghai Telegraph lowered to 14.7 yuan, with the high price seen at 68,000 yuan. Finally, the price fell to a low of 65,000 yuan to end. The result compared to the previous close showed that Yeguang, Yipi, Aviation, Steel, and Cultivation rose slightly, Yisha fell slightly, and British-United, Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Telephone were all flat.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market Active, Prices Rose Straight Yesterday, Factory Silk Calm, Transactions Thin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for rayon continued to rise. No. 120 Takayama Yuko opened in the morning, still calling the last price of the previous day as 19.3 million yuan. Then, because the demand from all sides was very good, the price rose in a straight line, and it was immediately traded at 800,000 yuan. The midday close actually rushed out of the 20 million yuan mark. In the afternoon, because there were people who wanted to dispose of their stock at high prices, the price called back slightly. The last price sold was 19.8 million yuan, which was still 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Toyo brands were shouting 100,000 yuan short, and other brands all rose and fell accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for factory silk was calm, and transactions were thin. Only D-grade prices were traded at several levels from 24.5 million to 800,000 yuan. All other grades only had asking prices but no transactions. Because it was rumored that the price of fresh cocoons in Wuxi was between 1.2 million and 1.3 million yuan, and the reeling yield was quite good, all parties maintained a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in very thin absorption.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was quite excited. True silk bedding rose by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and Dacheng Plaid Crepe rose by 1,500 yuan. The morning opening started at 35,200 yuan. After many parties pulled it up, the largest bid was 6,000 yuan, and the closing price returned slightly, with a transaction at 5,600 yuan. The interval date opened at 6,000 yuan. The market price of rayon goods was flat and tired. Because actual sales were light, it was unable to rise. Huajin Crepe high-grade yesterday made 17,000 yuan, and Shenghang and other goods did not change from the original plate.</p>
<h3>Estimated Autumn Raw Cotton Harvest in China to Exceed 10 Million Dan, No Need to Rely on Foreign Supply of Raw Materials Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhou Bingwen, Executive Member of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, met with reporters yesterday to discuss in detail matters related to cotton production, tobacco leaves, and food in China. The main points are extracted and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In terms of increasing raw cotton production, in December of last year, he was entrusted by the former President of the Executive Yuan, Song, to plan the Raw Cotton Increase Plan of the National Cotton Production Improvement Office. He accepted and allocated the office's annual expenditure of 9.8 billion yuan according to the predetermined plan, so that the entire production increase plan could be promoted. The cotton seeds sown this year included 500 dan each of foreign and domestic seeds, totaling 100,000 dan, which were planted in various regions of the country. Among them, Hubei accounted for the most, followed by Shaanxi, Henan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, etc. Hebei and Shandong were originally important cotton-growing areas, but unfortunately, due to the war, the work was hindered.</p>
<p>According to this cotton planting plan, when the new cotton enters the market between September and October of this year, it is estimated that 12.5 million dan of raw cotton can be harvested. If the current national cotton spinning industry is fully opened to 4 million spindles, and each spindle consumes 3 dan of cotton per year, the completion of this production increase plan means that China will no longer need to rely on foreign supply of raw materials next year. Unfortunately, the war continues in various parts of the country, and the recent drought in the north will inevitably affect the completion of the plan. However, the output of raw cotton at the end of this year should greatly increase compared to the total output of 7 million dan in the previous year. At the same time, it can also save a large amount of foreign exchange funds for the country. Currently, the branches of the Cotton Production Improvement Office are widely established throughout the country. There are more than 400 technical staff. It is expected that the office's annual expenditure for next year will be expanded to 50 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of increasing tobacco production, there were originally three fixed points, namely Xuchang in Henan, Weixian area in Shandong, and Mentai in Anhui. At present, Shandong can only concentrate on increasing the planting of tobacco leaves in Xuchang due to the current situation, and Anhui due to the soil conditions. The tobacco fields in this area have expanded from 400,000 mu last year to 700,000 mu this year. Therefore, the output of tobacco leaves this year should greatly increase compared to last year.</p>
<p>In terms of food, he believes that in addition to ordering foreign rice for supply, the fundamental solution is to increase production. He said: Before the war, China imported foreign rice worth more than 200 million yuan in legal tender per year. However, the imported amount only accounted for 5% of China's production. China's food production cannot be increased due to the government's neglect of agriculture. Therefore, for the present plan, we should still try to increase production as much as possible, and especially need to take into account the production costs of farmers.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Revises Mooring Buoy Rental Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs recently released Announcement No. 137, stating: After examination and approval, the rental fees for customs mooring buoys are hereby revised from now on as follows: Class A buoy (per day or part thereof) National Currency 250,000 yuan. Class C buoy (per day or part thereof) National Currency 120,000 yuan. Furthermore, if a ship stays at a customs buoy for longer than the originally applied period, the rental fee for the exceeding period shall be collected at four times the fixed amount. Also, if a ship engages in repairs or has other reasons for not loading or unloading goods during the period of mooring at a customs buoy, the rental fee shall also be collected at four times the specified amount. However, if the repair work of a ship loading and unloading goods at the same time cannot be completed within the originally approved mooring period, an application may be made to extend the mooring period. The initial ten days of the extended period will still be charged at the fixed rate, and from the eleventh day onwards, the fee will be four times the fixed rate.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Avoids Tender, Sells a Batch of Old Tea at Fixed Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to reporters' inquiries from the tea industry: The China Trust Bureau began selling bulk old tea for export through tender yesterday. Peifeng, Wang Yutai, Wuchang and other export houses tendered for hundreds of boxes, with old special tribute tea tendered at 170,000 to 350,000 yuan per dan, and old Zhenmei at 351,000 yuan per dan. It is heard that the old tea sold in this tender is of good quality and is at least 70% cheaper than the market price. It is also learned that the China Trust Bureau plans to publicly tender a considerable amount of tea for domestic sales next time, and the quality is also quite good.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Supports Simplified Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association of Shanghai, in order to protest the audit and assessment of profits tax and support the simplification of tax collection by the Municipal Council, issued a declaration yesterday, stating: Audit and assessment can only be applied when people's livelihood is stable, and cannot be tried today when all industries are in poverty. What our industry and commerce are fighting for is that the current audit method is simply not feasible, and it is not about how capital can be enough to be slaughtered. In terms of capital, the more the book figures increase, the less the actual materials, the more the loss is real, the more the profit is virtual, and the original capital is larger, and the loss is even greater. The association wholeheartedly supports the simplified tax collection method resolved by the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Gu Shanchang Goes to Capital to Convey Brokers' Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The opinions on subscribing for US dollar bonds decided at the previous meeting of the Securities Exchange Brokers Association have been verbally discussed with the Securities Exchange Authority yesterday by the person in charge of the association. It is now learned that Gu Shanchang, the current Securities Exchange Association, was dispatched to the Capital last night. Wang Xitang and Wu Gonglu, the resident supervisors of the Ministry of Finance and Economics, also went with him. It is said that in addition to conveying the opinions of the brokers to the Ministry of Finance and Economics, Gu Min will also submit four types of stocks for listing to the ministry for approval so that they can be listed and opened for auction. It is reported that there are currently a total of 48 types of stocks applied for listing. Only four types have been reviewed and approved by the Securities Exchange Listing Securities Review Committee so far.</p>
<h3>National Banks Conduct Preliminary Discussions on the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] President Zhang of the Central Bank convened a meeting at the bank at 4 pm yesterday, inviting Wang Yunwu, Wu Yunchu, Li Fusun, and Fu Rulin to talk, and it did not end until about 6 pm. It is heard that the content of the meeting was related to how to accelerate the sale of state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet properties.

<h3>Urban Construction and Local Autonomy</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zu</p>
<p>——Introducing the Significance of "Neighborhood Unit" Design——</p>
<p>For more than a year, Shanghai's urban planning work has been actively promoted by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Planning Committee and the Public Works Bureau. Recently, the "General Plan" has been submitted to the Municipal Consultative Council for review. In a few more months, the finalization of the plan for Greater Shanghai will be completed in its technical design phase and will enter the stage of administrative approval and actual implementation.</p>
<p>On this June 6th Engineer's Day, I would like to take the liberty of discussing the meaning of "urban construction" contained in the term "urban planning," as well as its relationship to and possible impact on "local autonomy," in order to celebrate the smooth progress and success of a challenging sector in our Chinese engineers' future nation-building work—namely, urban planning.</p>
<p>Urban Construction is Based on Natural Construction</p>
<p>A country has its major aspects of construction, such as economic construction, political construction, military construction, etc. The same is true for a city. It can be divided into three aspects: first, economic construction; second, social construction; and third, natural construction (Physical Development). The object of urban planning is natural construction, but the planners aim to generate power for economic construction and social construction from the planned development of natural construction. This can be said to be a grand vision of our engineers.</p>
<p>For example, if in the urban plan of Shanghai, after comprehensive and detailed investigation and research, and debate on both sides, it is decided that the "General Plan" includes the Pujiang Bridge or Tunnel. The decision from the general plan will strengthen the confidence and efforts of those who advocate cross-river projects. The result? It is completed in a few years or within the time limit stipulated in the plan. Then, what kind of effective power it will produce for other natural constructions in Pudong and Puxi and for the entire economic and social construction of Shanghai is foreseeable. Therefore, although urban construction has three aspects—social, economic, and natural—the general public and those studying engineering focus on the natural construction aspect, just as the focus of a country's economic plan is often on industrial construction, transportation construction, agricultural construction, and so on.</p>
<p>The natural construction of a city can be said to be the foundation of the city's social and economic construction, and "urban construction" should focus on the natural construction aspect. This is the recognition and interpretation of urban construction by our engineers on the "June 6th" Commemoration Day.</p>
<p>Local Autonomy Requires a New Baojia System</p>
<p>What is the relationship between urban construction and local autonomy? The relationship lies in the interaction between the natural construction and social and economic construction of the city, as described above. In terms of the city, local autonomy is nothing less than the city's political or social construction. The most important point of local autonomy lies in the ability of the people of a place to elect local officials to manage their own affairs and to run the police themselves to protect the safety of their lives and property. According to our current local autonomy system, there are organizations such as townships, baojia, and households. Only with this organization can various local autonomy facilities be promoted. To achieve the formation and improvement of this organization, and to coordinate this organization with various facilities, urban planning will be the most powerful and reasonable method.</p>
<p>One of the important principles of modern urban planning is the establishment of "Neighborhood Units." The neighborhood unit can be said to be a new baojia organization. What is a "neighborhood unit"? Modern urban planners regard the city as an organic body and hope that the city can be ruralized both in its natural and social sense, hence the design of neighborhood units. We see that the citizens of Shanghai, even those living in the same alley or next door, often do not know each other's names or communicate with each other. However, Confucius, more than two thousand years ago, meaningfully said: "It is beautiful to live in a neighborhood with benevolence." He also said: "Virtue is never solitary; it always has neighbors." But today's Shanghai, and many of the world's cities, are not like this. As a result, people in the city, away from home, only have factories, "offices," shops, clubs, entertainment venues, etc., and lose the friendship of neighborhood and community life. Thus, the spiritual life of the city seems to only consist of competition, acquisition, or pain, jealousy, or indulgent licentiousness and enjoyment. This is the greatest loss of modern urban civilization. The neighborhood unit is to compensate for this loss.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Neighborhood Units</p>
<p>Now let's look at the design of the composition of neighborhood units in the second draft report of the Shanghai Urban Planning General Plan.</p>
<p>In the report, the planned future city of Shanghai will be divided into twelve district units (originally also called urban area units). Below the district unit, there will be "town units" (originally called town units). There are green belts separating the units. It has high schools, hospitals, churches, police stations, post offices, etc. Below the town unit, there is a "community unit" (originally called intermediate unit). The community unit is surrounded by so-called "auxiliary arterial roads," and should include a junior high school and hospitals, police stations, etc. Below the community unit, there is a "neighborhood unit" (originally called small unit).</p>
<p>Each neighborhood unit must have a primary school. Each complete primary school has six grades, with two classes in each grade, and forty students in each class. The entire school can have 480 students. According to the situation in Shanghai, school-age children account for twelve percent of the population, which is enough to meet the needs of children from four thousand people to attend school. This is the smallest design organization in Shanghai's urban planning. In addition to primary schools, it must have public libraries, kindergartens, nurseries, sports fields, children's playgrounds, and shopping centers.</p>
<p>From the neighborhood unit, community unit, town unit, to the district unit, in addition to the above-mentioned design regulations with various organic properties, there are also the following considerations regarding land use and location in terms of walking distance and time:</p>
<p>1. Within the neighborhood unit, the walking time from the residence to the daily necessities store should not exceed ten minutes.</p>
<p>2. Within the neighborhood unit, the walking time for primary school students from the residence to the school should be at most fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>3. Reduce the distance from the residence to the workplace to a 30-minute walk.</p>
<p>4. Entertainment areas and residences must be within a 30-minute walking distance.</p>
<p>5. The walking distance from the home to the regular administrative agency should not exceed 45 minutes.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, it can be seen that the future Shanghai, if implemented according to the ideal of urban planners, will be a very economically configured, harmonious, and vibrant organic body, and its basic organization lies in the "neighborhood unit."</p>
<p>This kind of neighborhood unit, in form, seems like the bao and jia under the county, city, district, township in our country's local autonomy system (the new baojia organization mentioned above). However, the baojia organization is modified from the traditional social organization of the past. Based on natural development, it seems to have lost its meaning and function. As mentioned above, taking the Shanghai alley as an example, dozens of households in an alley are organized into several bao and several jia, but they still do not know each other's names and do not interact with each other. Each household lives separately. How can it have the function of social autonomy? Moreover, under the situation where rents are abnormal, landlords do not care, and public morality is low, the problems of cleaning and repairing garbage, ditches, and roads in Shanghai's private alleys cannot be reasonably solved.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the neighborhood unit combines the design of housing location, the design of transportation systems, and the design of public places such as schools, health centers, and public meeting places for about 4,000 people in a unit, making it truly a close-knit neighborhood, a community with social life. At that time, how convenient and effective it will be for you to have them elect, jointly guard, jointly prevent epidemics, jointly organize garbage cleaning and repair of road ditches, jointly develop or improve primary school education, etc. This is the role of the neighborhood unit.</p>
<p>By extension, the community unit, town unit, and district unit can also exert their respective individuality and functions. With this, local autonomy can succeed with ease. This is the new path proposed by our engineers for promoting local autonomy on Engineer's Day today.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that Shanghai's engineers, the people in Shanghai who handle local autonomy—the Department of Civil Affairs and personnel from various districts—as well as Shanghai's enthusiastic social activists, and all citizens, can recognize that both urban construction and local autonomy must start with urban planning, and that our country's new urban planning must be able to promote the organization and construction of "neighborhood units," and must be able to coordinate the autonomous organization with the natural organization of each level of the city in urban planning. This is not only local natural construction, it is also social reform, it is the prerequisite natural condition for local autonomy, it is the foundation of democracy, it is the matter of the whole China, and it is the great aspiration and responsibility of our engineers.

<h3>Prospects for Shipbuilding Engineering in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Xu Xueyu</p>
<p>Shipbuilding engineering in our country has never been valued by the world; compared with other engineering departments in our country, shipbuilding engineering can be said to be calm and least noticed.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, there were more than 1.2 million tons of ships along the Yangtze River and coast of our country. Among them, more than 600,000 tons were national ships. Due to the economic aggression of foreign businessmen, the shackles of unequal treaties, and the unsound maritime regulations in our country, most of the national ships were old and rotten. It was not easy for shipping companies to make a living; of course, they could not add new ships. Even if there were, they were very few. Therefore, at that time, the shipbuilding industry in our country was very dull; at the same time, it was not sound and was not noticed by people, which was a natural result.</p>
<p>After the victory, the right of navigation was recovered. During the rehabilitation period, there was a sudden shortage of ships. Therefore, in order to save time, various shipping agencies ordered a large number of ships from foreign countries. Up to now, our country has 700,000 tons of ships. Most of the sources of these ships are old ships from foreign countries or surplus ships after the war. Of course, they can be used temporarily to maintain water transportation when ships are in short supply after the victory. However, these ships are either too large in tonnage or too deep in draft. The cost of repair and maintenance is very huge, which is not only unsuitable for the situation of our country's ports, but also very uneconomical and absolutely cannot compete with foreign businessmen. The conclusion drawn from this fact is that if we want to obtain ships suitable for the situation of our country's ports, or if we want to open up ocean lines and compete with foreign businessmen, we must build new ships.</p>
<p>At the same time, before the war, there were more than 1.2 million tons of ships along the Yangtze River and coast of our country. At that time, Japan's total tonnage of ships along the coast was about 5 million tons. If we not only fill up the tonnage along the Yangtze River and coast, but also replace part of Japan's shipping business before the war, our country will need at least 2.5 million tons of merchant ships. If the prescribed age of each merchant ship is 25 years, then our country must build at least 100,000 tons of new ships every year to supplement it in order to maintain this 2.5 million tons of necessary tonnage, not including the construction of special ships such as warships and fishing boats.</p>
<p>Therefore, shipbuilding engineering will have the hope and need of gradual development in the future. At the same time, it is indeed noticed by the government. Recently, the National Resources Commission is planning to set up a central shipyard, the gradual expansion and equipment of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the Ministry of Communications is planning to set up a ship repair and construction plant, etc., which are examples of this.</p>
<p>However, the construction of the shipbuilding industry has several necessary conditions, which must be gradually realized and improved. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>Formulation of Maritime Regulations</p>
<p>Maritime regulations have the greatest relationship with the design of new ships. In their maritime regulations, all countries have very detailed regulations on the structure of various parts of ships, the waterproof and fireproof equipment of ships, the freeboard of ships, boilers, main engines and auxiliary machines, and the size of crew members' rooms and berths. In other words, maritime regulations can also be regarded as the standard for ship structure and equipment. International conferences have been held many times to stipulate the safety standards and freeboard regulations for various ships on international routes, but each country still has its own special regulations due to its special circumstances. For example, the United States has regulations on ships on the Great Lakes and inland rivers, Japan has regulations on ships in the inland sea, and the United Kingdom has regulations on immigrant ships in various colonies. The Suez and Panama Canals and other governments have their own regulations. Our country's maritime regulations can be said to have no foundation. Even the most basic freeboard law has not been stipulated. Even the various terms related to ships have no standard. Therefore, the shipbuilding engineering community in our country should assist the government in formulating very perfect maritime regulations as soon as possible. Not only can our country's new ships be designed according to a certain standard in the future, but also our country's shipping industry can use this standard to maintain and maintain the safety and effectiveness of their ships. This is not only necessary for shipbuilding engineering, but also a necessary and urgent measure for the future of the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Ship Model Testing Tank</p>
<p>Most of the fuel saving for ships depends on the improvement of ship type and propeller. The research on ship type and propeller can be said to be the most important development in shipbuilding engineering in the past 20 years. This research depends entirely on the ship model testing tank. Countries all over the world, such as Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain, Norway, Sweden, etc., have ship model testing tanks. Universities in various countries are also often equipped with ship model testing tanks for experiments. The correct horsepower of various ship types, as well as the improvement of ship types and the increase of propeller efficiency, must be determined in the testing tank. The situation of the water flow along the Yangtze River and coast of our country has its own characteristics. To match the characteristics of this water flow, special ship types and propellers should also be used, and their generation must rely on the testing tank. Therefore, if our country wants to build new ships to exert their highest efficiency in special routes, it must establish a well-equipped ship model testing tank for detailed research. At the same time, if you want to determine the horsepower when designing a new ship, you must also have a ship model testing tank.</p>
<p>Improvement of Machine Building Technology</p>
<p>Shipbuilding and machine building are interdependent and must be carried out in a complementary manner to build good ships. Our country could manufacture ordinary smoke tube or water tube boilers and ordinary reciprocating steam engines and semi-Diesel diesel engines before the War of Resistance. However, their efficiency was very ordinary. If high-pressure boilers, high-pressure and low-pressure steam turbines, new steam engines, high-speed diesel engines, and electric propulsion and other newer and more accurate machines, there is no factory in China that can manufacture them. This is the biggest shortcoming of our country's shipbuilding engineering. Of course, machine building technology is closely related to the improvement of general machinery industry. At the same time, the technology of steel smelting also has a great impact. On this point, engineering experts in shipbuilding, machine building, and smelting must work together to establish the ship machinery industry, so that the technology of machine building can be gradually improved to meet the needs of our new ships.</p>
<p>Establishment of Auxiliary Machine Industry</p>
<p>There are many types of auxiliary machines for ships, too numerous to mention one by one. Usually, shipyards do not manufacture all of them. Instead, there are various specialized factories, collectively called auxiliary machine industry, such as steering gears, telegraphs, anchor winches, feed water pumps, circulating pumps, air pumps, generators, air conditioners, and anchors, anchor chains, steel wire ropes, etc., which can be manufactured separately in specialized factories. In the future, as our country's shipbuilding industry gradually develops, this auxiliary machine industry will inevitably emerge. The government is willing to provide more support, so that the entire shipbuilding industry can stand tall.</p>
<p>The above points are all necessary conditions for the development of our country's shipbuilding industry. Therefore, I specifically put them forward, hoping that the shipbuilding engineering community will pay more attention and work harder, so that the ships needed by our country in the future can be manufactured in our own country, can exert their special efficiency, and can compete with others on international routes. At the same time, I also hope that the government and the shipping industry will provide more assistance to the shipbuilding engineering community and build our country's shipbuilding industry as soon as possible, so as to improve the performance of our ships and truly develop our country's shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Was Founded for Telecommunications Construction: Department of Telecommunications Management</h3>
<p>— Yu Bingjian</p>
<p>Telecommunications and transportation are to a country what the nervous system is to the human body. The length of the circuits and the quality of the machinery can be used as a standard for measuring the prosperity and decline of national power. They occupy an extremely important position in national defense, economy, politics, and industry. Our country began to run its own telegraph service in the fifth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1879 AD). It has been more than 60 years since then. Although the establishment of telephone was later than telegraph, it also has a history of more than 40 years. According to statistics before the war, there are more than 1,000 telegraph and telephone bureaus across the country, with more than 100,000 miles of lines. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the southeastern half of the country fell into the hands of the enemy, and telecommunications and transportation were devastated. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the electrical communications in major cities gradually recovered. However, in order to meet the needs of the times and complete the mission of national construction, the current telecommunications industry still needs to continue to work hard. Based on my observations, I will briefly describe my hopes for improving China's telecommunications:</p>
<p>(1) Wired Telegraph: Wired telegraph still occupies a considerable position in China's telecommunications industry today. However, the routes have been destroyed by the war and have been severely damaged, and they need to be repaired urgently. At the same time, the number of lines should be increased. Important circuits should be replaced with copper wires. Phantom and carrier wave devices should be used. Automatic machines should be used more. Facsimile telegraph and teletype should be gradually developed. Underground cables should be installed in Beijing and Shanghai. Submarine cables should be laid in important coastal cities and towns to strengthen national defense and protect the confidentiality of communications.</p>
<p>(2) Wireless Telegraph: In the early stage of telecommunications construction, wireless should be fully utilized to supplement the lack of line construction. More direct routes should be opened, especially for communications in border areas. Bureaus with heavier business should use transmitters of 1 kilowatt or more at a minimum to reduce the attenuation and interference during communication.</p>
<p>(3) Wired Telephone: Wired telephone is the foundation for building a domestic communication network. Laying lines and improving components should be carried out simultaneously. All major cities should use automatic telephone sets. Carrier wave equipment should be used as much as possible to improve the transmission efficiency of long-distance telephone. For remote townships, in order to facilitate business communication and mutual assistance, telephones should be added. In the initial stage, common battery or magneto telephone sets can also be used. Make sure to connect with the city anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>(4) Wireless Telephone: It is currently important to widely install wireless telephones between international and domestic major cities with long distances and difficult line construction to communicate news.</p>
<p>The above only mentioned the most important aspects of improving telecommunications equipment. As for how to develop China's telecommunications industry and make it thrive, the focus is on whether the entire telecommunications technology and management are sound. If there is only telecommunications technology without a sound management method, there will be no way to lead subordinates and smoothly promote the work. All telecommunications supervisors cannot stick to the expertise of each technology or the excellence of certain knowledge and be complacent. They must be proficient in "telecommunications technology and management," or simply "telecommunications management," in order to be able to plan and organize and be competent and happy. The so-called "telecommunications management" does not mean that technical personnel are engaged in administrative management. Its nature is that technology and management are mutually supportive. At least, they must have an in-depth study of technology and a considerable understanding of administrative management. Recently, I heard that Americans attach great importance to the management of various businesses, finance, and operations. It has become a force equal to engineering technology.</p>
<p>For the past 50 years, Jiaotong University has aimed to cultivate technical and management talents for various industries. All colleges of engineering, science, and management have their own specialties. Talents have emerged in large numbers over the years and have contributed a lot to society and the country. Two years ago, the Ministry of Communications believed that China's telecommunications construction industry was expanding day by day. In addition to the need to train a large number of technical personnel to meet the needs of dispatch, the need for "telecommunications management" talents became more urgent. Therefore, a "Telecommunications Management" department was added to take into account both technology and administration, so that skilled technicians would not be ignorant of administration. Once they take over as supervisors, they often feel unable to cope with the situation with ease. On the one hand, it can be said that it is adapting to the current needs of the telecommunications industry. On the other hand, it can also be said that it integrates the telecommunications technology and management courses of the university's colleges of engineering and management into one furnace to make up for the shortcomings of the past. The admission test for first-year students in the Department of Telecommunications Management is based on the standards of the colleges of engineering and management, focusing on Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and must have management interest and ability, so that they have a considerable foundation in each subject before entering school, and it is easier to make progress in studying advanced technology and management. After entering school, the curriculum was hand-ordered by experts from the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications and Jiaotong University, including:</p>
<p>First year</p>
<p>Chinese, English, Calculus, Mechanics, Heat, Acoustics, Optics, Magnetism and Electricity, Economic Geography, Bookkeeping and Accounting, Principles of Economics, General Theory of Law, Mechanical Practice.</p>
<p>Second year</p>
<p>English, Second Foreign Language, Differential Equations, Electrical Engineering, Introduction to Telecommunications, Thermal Power Engineering Internal Combustion Engine Science, Storage Battery Science, Financial Mathematics, Enterprise Paper Weaving and Finance, Advanced Accounting, Physical Experiment, Engineering Practice.</p>
<p>Third year</p>
<p>Telegraphy, Telephone Engineering, Line Engineering, Telecommunications Transmission, Engineering Electronics, History of Chinese and Foreign Telecommunications, Cost Accounting and Pricing Principles, Telecommunications Accounting, Industrial, Commercial, and Personnel Management, Materials Management, Commercial Law, Electrical Engineering Experiment, Summer Practice.</p>
<p>Fourth year</p>
<p>Wireless Electrical Engineering, Carrier Wave Information, Telecommunications Filters and Networks, Facsimile, Ultra Shortwave, Speech Writing, Economic Policy, Financial Report Analysis, Telecommunications Regulations and Business Handling, Chinese and Foreign Telecommunications Systems, Telecommunications Experiment, Thesis.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the establishment of the department, I temporarily served as the head of the department. I always feel that the curriculum is not perfect enough. It should be revised at any time according to the needs of the actual situation, and I hope that virtuous and advanced people will show me the way, so that I can make up for the shortcomings. I would be very grateful.</p>
<h3>Brief History of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Municipal Engineering Society was established in Chongqing in 1943 and has been in existence for four years. Its purpose is to promote the improvement of municipal engineering. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the general headquarters moved to Nanjing. In order to develop the society's affairs, it was decided to establish branches in major military cities to strengthen the organization and develop the society's affairs. The first branch to be established was the Beijing branch. After careful preparation by the members in Shanghai, the Shanghai branch was formally established on May 2 this year. Zhao Zukang, Yao Shilian, Lu Qianshou, Wu Wenhua, Yang Mingding, Wang Dashi, Yu Haoming, etc. were elected as directors, and Mao Yisheng and Chen Fuhua were elected as supervisors. Among the directors, Zhao Zukang, Yao Shilian, and Lu Qianshou were elected as directors in charge. Zhao Zukang was the chairman of the branch, and the Transportation Research Committee, the Architectural Research Committee, the Sanitary Engineering Research Committee, and the Editorial Committee were established, and Mei Fuqiang, Wang Dingzeng, Gu Kangle, and Chen Fuhua were respectively invited to preside over them, and experts were invited to participate. It will definitely make extensive contributions to the improvement of municipal engineering. The number of members in this branch is 51, including 28 basic members, 18 members, and 7 junior members. The address of the society is temporarily located in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works. In the near future, it will be expanded to solicit members in order to promote the prosperity of the society's affairs.</p>
<h3>A Brief Overview of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</h3>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers has its headquarters at No. 3, Lane 517, Middle Zhengzheng Road, Shanghai. It is the only national organization for young engineers in our country, dedicated to national construction, promoting technical education, advancing academic research, and seeking common welfare. It was initially formed in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], when engineers in enemy-occupied areas, resolved not to yield to the invaders, gathered more than 30 people. They secretly communicated and, under the guise of a Chinese Science Society gathering, called themselves the "Extracurricular Friendship Society." Taking care to avoid the enemy's suspicion, the group had grown to over 400 members by the time of the surrender. In the 35th year of the Republic [1946], with the restoration of our land, it was renamed as it is now. Then, expanding its affairs and raising funds, the headquarters were established within a year. To date, the membership has reached over 800. Our association has been working diligently and practically to promote its work, such as establishing industrial lectures and engineering magazines, and the Chinese Technical Vocational School, to advance technical education (to help promote and popularize technical education); such as initiating the Shanghai Brewing Factory, organizing consumer cooperatives, and holding industrial tours to seek welfare for members; other activities include hosting the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition at the Ningbo Association and participating in hosting the Chinese Export Goods Exhibition, sparing no effort to develop the association. This is a record. (Yu Shiyuan)</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Chinese Society of Power Engineering</h3>
<p>Power engineering is closely related to specialized technologies such as electrical machinery and civil engineering. Its nature is comprehensive and cannot be fully encompassed by any single academic organization mentioned above. Relevant individuals had proposed the establishment of an organization before the war. In June of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], a founding conference was held in Chongqing, with the aim of studying power engineering academics and promoting the development of power engineering. Pan Mingxin, Chen Zhongxi, Zhang Jiazhi, Chen Zuguang, and Chai Zhiming were elected as directors to advance the association's affairs. With the arrival of victory, members were stationed in various regions, engaged in restoration and construction work. It was decided to establish branches in important industrial areas. The Shanghai branch was established on December 29th of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], and the Xiwu branch (Wuxi and Changzhou area) was established on April 19th of the 36th year of the Republic [1947]. Xu Xin, Ba Rongquan, Qing Zou, Hong Ji, etc. were elected as directors. Branches in Beiping [Beijing] and other places are also being planned. In February of the 36th year of the Republic [1947], the general association re-elected Chen Zhongxi, Chen Zuguang, Zhao Zengjue, Pan Mingxin, and Zhang Jiazhe as executive directors, and Xian Ti, Lu Fazeng as executive supervisors. The association's affairs are progressing, with the general association constantly encouraging branches in various regions to advance together and preparing to publish a periodical to introduce the latest developments in power engineering abroad, as well as reporting on various domestic power engineering developments. Branches in various regions hold regular meetings to exchange academic information and jointly study and resolve various power engineering issues.</p>
<h3>A Word of Commemoration for Engineers' Day</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Lun</p>
<p>Our country has celebrated Engineers' Day since the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. At that time, due to the war of resistance, transportation to the rear areas was cut off, resources were scarce, and all levels of society regarded industrial construction and production as the only important tasks. The position of engineers was valued by the general public, and the status and reputation of engineers rose like the morning sun. Engineers themselves knew to work hard and diligently. Major projects that were不敢尝试before the war, requiring foreign talent, could now be shouldered and quickly completed by our engineers. Items that could not be manufactured domestically before the war, which factories were hesitant to produce, could now be ingeniously and successfully imitated to meet urgent needs in the difficult wartime environment. Equipment and materials essential for daily operations in industry, mining, and transportation, which were completely dependent on imports before the war and could not be manufactured due to equipment limitations, could now be replaced with various substitutes to cope with the situation. Significant contributions were made during the eight years of resistance against Japan. Starting from the 27th year of the Republic [1938], annual meetings were held in Chongqing, Minming, Chengdu, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Guilin, and other places, with local governments and communities vying to welcome and warmly receive them. During the conferences, urgent and critical engineering problems of the local area were submitted for discussion, demonstrating the high expectations and trust that the people of the country placed in engineers. As large-scale construction work begins in the future, with all undertakings to be restored, the weight of the heavy burden will fall on our shoulders. On this Engineers' Day, I offer my humble suggestions as follows:</p>
<p>The fate of China and the industrial construction plan both list the number of technical personnel needed in the future, but how many technical personnel does the country actually have? There is no accurate statistic from public or private organizations. Before the war of resistance, the Resources Committee conducted a widespread survey, but only found over 10,000 people. The technician registrations conducted by the pre-war Ministry of Industry and the wartime Economic Department totaled only several thousand people. During the war, the Central Design Bureau conducted a survey, but no statistical figures were ever released. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], the Ministry of Education compiled statistics based on the number of graduates from university engineering departments and secondary vocational schools, estimating about 20,000 senior personnel and about 50,000 to 60,000 intermediate personnel. However, students studying abroad and technical personnel trained by factories themselves were not included. As construction begins in the future, more talent will be needed, and training and cultivation must be carried out to fill the gap. How many personnel do we already have? How many are in each category? How many are engaged in private business? How many serve in government agencies? How many have changed careers? How many are still unemployed? Our intelligence is not inferior; it depends on proper utilization. For the sake of advance planning, it seems appropriate for government agencies and private organizations to work together to conduct a widespread survey, without omissions, for the country's reference. My fellow engineers should also strive to cooperate. Any survey forms should be filled out and submitted truthfully. If they are regarded as insignificant and ignored, then it will be difficult for this work to succeed.</p>
<p>The areas of work for our engineering personnel generally include transportation, industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, educational institutions, and practicing engineers who serve society. The latter is an absolute minority, and it can be concluded that civil engineering and architecture account for the majority of this small number, while mechanical, electrical, chemical, and textile engineering are few. The difference from countries such as Britain and the United States cannot be overstated. The reason for this is that society does not pay enough attention to them, and our own efforts are insufficient. In the future, public and private construction will be carried out simultaneously, and industrial and mining enterprises will develop rapidly. The construction of new factories, the improvement of management methods, the increase of production efficiency, and the solution of engineering problems will all come one after another. There will inevitably be a large demand for self-employed consulting engineers. Furthermore, the Patent Law has already been promulgated by the government and will soon be implemented. Agents serving inventors, such as lawyers and accountants, will take on their responsibilities, but our engineers are also indispensable members. Judging from the large number of invention patent cases in countries such as Britain and the United States, the affairs must be very complicated. This is an area where we should pay close attention to serving in the future.</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers has been established for more than 30 years and has achieved remarkable results and a long history. However, government agencies have always regarded it as an academic organization, and there are few opportunities to participate in elections at all levels of representative bodies. My fellow engineers should also regard this as a regrettable matter. However, upon closer examination, the crux of the problem is not difficult to understand. Lawyers serve to protect human rights, so the government has enacted the Lawyers Law. Accountants serve to audit assets and profits and losses, so the government has promulgated the Accountants Law. Engineers serve society, and their impact is significant, affecting private property in small matters and public safety in large matters. The relationship cannot be underestimated. However, the lack of specific legislation to protect their legal status has led to them not being valued. Furthermore, according to the procedures for technicians to practice, they must first apply to the Examination Yuan's Examination Committee for examination. After passing the examination, they must obtain a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs before finally applying to the local competent authority to practice. The so-called examination is only a review of qualifications, and the so-called registration is only the issuance of a certificate. There are no explicit provisions regarding the service, methods, responsibilities, rights, and obligations of technicians. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has long recognized this, and I have also collected and consulted various materials in preparation for drafting a trial version. Unfortunately, due to repeated delays, I have not been able to achieve success. For the sake of the future interests of our engineering profession, it seems that we must plan for this as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that my fellow engineers will work together to propose opinions for the reference of the competent authorities.</p>
<p>The above is what I have felt and thought of at the moment. I dare not present excessively high-sounding arguments. I only present the efforts that we ourselves should make and present them for the instruction of experts!</p>
<h3>The Current Responsibility of Engineers in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixu</p>
<p>Since the Opium War in 1842, the economic structure of our country, originally based on small-scale agriculture and family handicrafts, has been gradually destroyed to the point of collapse. Between 1865 and 1870, the Jiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai, the Fuzhou Shipyard, and the Tianjin Machine Factory were successively established, further promoting the transformation of our country's economic construction into a new phase. At this time, the word "engineer" began to give society a brand new impression.</p>
<p>Definition of Engineer</p>
<p>However, under the traditional concept of "that which is above form is called the Way; that which is below form is called the instrument," engineers are generally regarded as merely more skilled machine artisans. Another incorrect view is that engineers are merely copying Western methods of installing, operating, and repairing machinery, and that they are merely a necessary tool for capitalists. Although this view elevates the importance of engineers, it can also be said to be a not insignificant insult to engineers.</p>
<p>The initial impression of this term among Europeans and Americans was quite similar to that in our country. In English dictionaries, the definition of the word "engineer" is merely a draftsman, designer, supervisor, or operator of static or dynamic machines. In fact, these definitions do not encompass the meaning that the word "engineer" should have. The definition of an engineer should be "one who possesses the ability to direct progress and control the implementation of methods based on scientific principles."</p>
<p>During the course of this World War, due to the lack of raw materials and the limitations of tools, industries in various countries, for the sake of production, sought to overcome their difficulties in an environment where various objective conditions were not available. The status of engineers was rapidly enhanced. After the end of the war, because of the necessity of restoration and reconstruction, engineers became even more needed. Therefore, today's engineers, it is no exaggeration to say, have a sense of superiority. How to exert this sense of superiority is something that engineers themselves should be aware of, and society should have a universal re-recognition of. This is precisely what this article specifically puts forward and hopes that everyone will discuss together.</p>
<p>The result of our country's victory in the War of Resistance this time, on the one hand, proves the achievements of our country's inherent culture in national morality, but on the other hand, it also proves the indelible and brilliant efficacy of modern science. The practical and organizational efficacy of science can not only be applied to natural materials, but also to social order. This is the crystallization of Western civilization and is urgently needed by modern China. Our engineers should be at the forefront of shouldering this burden, penetrating the most important department of the revival enterprise—the production sector—and exerting their skills.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this main task, and to conform to the definition of an engineer, the steps that should be taken should be considered. Now I will divide it into two aspects: the group and the individual.</p>
<p>Engineer Group Organization</p>
<p>Regarding the group aspect, in theory, of course, the power of the group is greater than that of the individual. Engineers should break away from our country's traditional thinking, gather together, and organize, on the one hand, to expand the solicitation, and on the other hand, to strictly screen, which is what must be done now.</p>
<p>With a group that is substantial and pure, it can then exert the power of the group to achieve its predetermined task. There is also an important factor, which is to strengthen unity. In our country, where emphasis is placed on the individual over the group, most people do not like to participate in group activities. They think this is superfluous, 間的, and even think that it is for the success of a certain person, and sacrifices themselves. In addition, there is another erroneous view, even after participating in group activities, there is often a tradition of factionalism and regionalism. Since engineers are responsible for applying the practical and effective organization of science to social order, then the first step must be to improve their own organization.</p>
<p>The engineer group must have a creed. This creed is the full realization of the definition of an engineer—"one who possesses the ability to direct progress and control the implementation of methods based on scientific principles." Eternal life beyond time, space, and party affiliation.</p>
<p>Secondly, based on the creed, the group can replace the various members and express its position. When an engineer handles his business, its nature is twofold. On the one hand, it seeks a high degree of progress in the quality of production for the factory; on the other hand, it seeks convenience and safety in all aspects of the work process for the workers. Therefore, the engineer's position is absolutely neutral between labor and capital. This should be necessary to declare.</p>
<p>The above five points—expanding the organization, strictly screening, strengthening unity, announcing the creed, and declaring the position—are all about the group aspect. The following will talk about the individual aspect. Due to space limitations, the issue of responsibility will be discussed in detail in the next article.</p>

<h3>The Recent British Theater Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Last May, a group of Americans went to the New Theatre in London to visit. Recently, Laurence Olivier of that theater went to the United States. This American acting troupe performed Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" in London. This is an excellent acting troupe, but the box office was mediocre. The reason for the failure has nothing to do with the playwright or the actors. The most important thing is that British tastes today are different from before. For example, what Wilder writes about is survival, reproduction, and death. He uses the people of Grovers Corners to make philosophical reflections. Such imagination has never been seen in the British publishing industry after the war. Britain today does not focus on these kinds of life questions. Europe is currently facing many difficult problems and cannot have metaphysical dreams. It is as if there is an iron curtain to prevent the easternization of thought. Philosophy is no longer fashionable. What the average Briton likes is what appeals to the eyes and ears. British audiences always thought that the acting troupe from the richest America should have magnificent sets, but they were greatly disappointed to see only a few tables, chairs, and parasols. This conclusion is foolish, and it is probably created by preconceived notions?</p>
<p>What is performed in London is very different. The greatest success is romantic historical dramas, which win with costumes and colors. Except for the Old Vic, Olivier, and Richardson performing Shakespeare's historical plays, almost all of them play with the colors of costumes. The most beautiful costume success was the performance of Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan." In addition, audiences also like the color and musicality of language, such as the verse play "The Way to the Tomb."</p>
<p>The Dadlers Wells Theatre was revived in August 1945 and often stages British dance dramas. This theater was built in 1760. In February of last year, the Coveut Garden Theatre also reopened, which is also a memorable event. This Royal Opera House was converted into a dance hall for soldiers during the war, but fortunately it was not destroyed by the enemy. The red velvet seats and pink lampshades are still intact. Walking on the grand staircase during the intermission gives one a temporary illusion that peace has begun.</p>
<p>These two opera houses can be said to be full every night. Londoners are very welcome to have operas and dances from Paris, the United States, and Java staged there.</p>
<p>In the near future, it will probably be felt that the beauty of Shakespeare's historical plays and "Sleeping Beauty" is inappropriate?</p>

<h3>Love of the Pomegranate Flower</h3>
<p>— Yao Yu</p>
<p>In May, pomegranate flowers bloom red throughout Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Time passes quietly, and the wheels of the times are constantly turning. How can I, a child living in a silent and colorless world, not cheer for this crimson fire!?</p>
<p>In the dark night, I need a lamp to illuminate me. In the harsh winter, I need a fire to warm me. In the deep autumn, I need a fallen leaf to accompany me. But deep in my soul! I need a torch of life even more.</p>
<p>To make life meaningful, you have to fight! If you cannot understand the meaning of fighting, you will never be able to understand the meaning of life.</p>
<p>The martyrs are sleeping forever. Jesus was nailed to the cross and died. But time will not dilute human memory, and the hot blood shed by the martyrs will always be vivid in the hearts of millions of people. Although "Stealing Fire" is a myth, the spirit of Prometheus is eternally worshiped and praised by the world.</p>
<p>So, I love "fire", I love "blood", I love "pomegranate flowers" that have the same colors as fire and blood.</p>
<p>I am very attached to pomegranate flowers! For "life", for "life". …</p>
<p>Pomegranate flower—a poem written in blood, a banner made of fire, a song belonging to young people.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that it was the year when the pomegranate flowers outside the wall burned red the sky that I left my hometown for the first time and went to a distant place. …</p>
<p>Yuli · Tsuta</p>
<p>— Yu Shi</p>
<p>When the white florets of remembrance wither, I am in love with a Yuli trellis in the garden.</p>
<p>Some moonlit nights I have lingered among the flowers, counting the stars in the sky and fantasizing; perhaps weaving a dream close to scarlet, at that time I was placing my love on the girl in the next garden's building. Who is the girl who is playing this melancholy parting song, telling endless grievances in this long night? So I seek the person in the dark, and my longing is like a fallen flower abandoned in the soil.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the lonely and miserable Yuli trembled, breaking off the thread of my thoughts, and shattering the dream of the bright moon; so I went back to my room sadly, arranged my night's schedule, and thought to myself that I was already middle-aged!</p>
<p>But, no, I am still tasting my own youth, entrusting my years to the ruthless water...</p>
<p>It should be the season when Tsuta climb up the small wooden window, but here there are no green ranks, so I miss the deserted garden in my hometown.</p>
<p>In spring, they crawl out of the black fertile soil; and in the long summer, they climb up the small wooden window, peeking at my desk, stealing kisses from the small water pot on my desk.</p>
<p>I treasured them dearly, remembering with gratitude the piece of their kindness that came to visit me with dew-laden branches. They grew green at the foot of the wall, decorating the colors of the ugly earthen wall, until the autumn wind filled the garden.</p>
<p>Now, the deserted garden in my hometown is desolate. The small wooden window has lost its place, and what about Tsuta? Let the sigh be buried in the memories of the past.</p>
<h3>Roses</h3>
<p>— Chu Pinliang</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Xiumei picked a few roses from the garden. The color of the roses was purplish red, very bright.</p>
<p>She put them in a vase on the desk. At the same time, she took one out and gave it to me.</p>
<p>I was happy to accept it, so I reached out to take it, but my hand immediately retracted, wincing in pain. But Xiumei just giggled beside me and said:</p>
<p>"Brother, these roses have thorns."</p>
<p>I wanted to blame her unhappily.</p>
<p>"It's not my fault!"</p>
<p>Yes, the thorns are pricking my hand, what's the point of blaming others.</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Yu Yonghe of Renhe wrote "A Record of Collecting Sulfur," a kind of diary recording his service in Taiwan. The Keelung and Tamsui areas of Taiwan produce sulfur. Besides daily records of sulfur mining, the book details the mountains, rivers, dangers, terrains, strategic locations, customs of the indigenous people, and local conditions of the entire island. It is a useful work akin to Zhen Luliang's "An Occasional Record of the Beginning and End of Taiwan" and Lan Luzhou's "A Brief Account of Pacifying Taiwan." The book contains many poems. Here are a few verses about the indigenous people: "Tattooing is an old custom, with island shapes coiling on their backs. Sometimes they transform into leopards, with snake gods and bull demons fiercely grimacing." "Their chests and backs are covered in colorful patterns down to their waists, boasting of intricate brocades that surpass fine silk. Their jade-like skin and wrists are entirely tattooed, only their eyebrows are left untouched." "Fringes covering their foreheads and eyebrows resemble wandering monks, indistinguishable between men and women. In the evening, female companions bathe in the stream, a line of bodies splashing in the green waves." "Old men resemble women, and women resemble men, with no distinction between them. They pluck all facial hair, their beards and mustaches making them look like women."</p>
<p>Hu Zhu, known as "Gu Yu" (Ancient Fool) of the Yuan Dynasty, styled himself as the "Pure White Old Man." His poems are refined, opulent, elegant, and stately, completely devoid of frivolous or dissolute airs. His Song of the Pine and Cypress in the Cold Season begins with: "The painter does not paint the enchanting and flamboyant myriad red flowers of Luoyang, but paints the tall pines on Mount Emei;" and "He does not paint the lonely mountain with its oblique and scattered white plum blossoms, but paints the ancient cypress in front of Zhuge Liang's temple." His poetry is vigorous, resembling the works of Tang Dynasty poets. Wu Cheng's inscription on "Gu Yu's Poetic Selection" states: "Like sprouts emerging in late spring, or summer bamboo holding buds, after being nourished by dew and washed by rain, it is fragrant and alluring, delicately beautiful." This is true for both his five- and seven-character ancient and modern style poems, certainly not an exaggeration. Gu Yu personally compiled "Drafts of the Pure White Studio," but the volumes were scattered due to military unrest. What remains today is a re-edited and published version by his sixth-generation descendant, Huai.</p>
<p>The Pure White Old Man inscribed on Guo Tianxi's landscape painting: "Perilous peaks, thousands of feet high, emerald and verdant, resemble the grass hut of Kuang Lu. I hear the recluse is not to be summoned, as purple lingzhi mushrooms exhale fragrance in the warm spring and white clouds drift." Guo Tianxi's given name was Bi, styled Youzhi, and called Yunshan. He was from Dantu in the Yuan Dynasty. Skilled in calligraphy and painting, he studied calligraphy with Zhao Mengfu and mastered his style. Zhao Mengfu wrote a postscript after writing Songxue Ji, praising him profusely. His paintings of gnarled trees, bamboo, and rocks are full of natural charm. I wonder if what the Pure White Old Man inscribed is still extant in the world.</p>
<p>Brushes used for calligraphy and painting are a great achievement. Changli (Han Yu) wrote a biography of Mao Hao, recounting his lineage, titles, merits, and honors in particular detail, praising his elegant style. Recently, I saw an inscription by Hu Zhu, which stated that the way of his advancement and retreat, from beginning to end, aligns with people. The inscription reads: "Internally firm, externally accommodating, its use never ceases. Initially sharp, ultimately blunt, defeated by ink. Wielding it in your grasp, as your will dictates. Heaven's bounty, the Stone Canal, commendable are your great achievements. The bone structure of Yan Zhenqing and the sinews of Liu Gongquan, the mind upholds righteousness. Writing is not merely writing, truly embodies virtue."</p>
<p>Zhao Zhongmu's calligraphy skillfully inherited the family learning of Songxue. However, his poems and lyrics are rarely circulated. Those occasionally seen in scrolls are just single lines and brief phrases. Wang Tianliang of Wucheng possessed Zhao Yong's handwritten manuscripts with subtle inscriptions, which are the basis for the current "Collection of the Studio Knowing No Satisfaction." Zhongyong's poems and lyrics are clear and beautiful, such as his Butterfly Loves Flowers tune: "Her complexion is like a flower, her skin like snow, her charming eyes convey waves, secret intentions whispered low. After removing the knotted belt, sorrow remains unresolved, reluctant to part with such deep affection. After parting, longing grows ever stronger, on a future reunion, the flower in the mirror will be hard to pluck. The fragrant smoke of the precious seal fades, marital ties gradually wane, the jade flute plays a mournful tune under the twilight moon." His Water Melody Song tune goes: "Why does spring depart so hastily? Spring departs, yet the chill remains. The ground is covered with fallen flowers and fragrant grass, gradually feeling the green shade thicken. The desires of horse hooves and carriage dust, the years pass by with the ebb and flow of heat and cold, bustling for more than ten years. I have won the old age of my ruddy face, forsaking the beautiful forests and springs.</p>
<p>A precious saddle, golden reins, jade whip. In an instant, ambition is achieved, and dazzling splendor fills the eyes. Merit and fame come without intention, wealth and honor are but fleeting clouds, of no use to me! I entrust everything to a laugh, let not the wine cup be emptied." These verses contain a sense of the rise and fall of dynasties and the emotions of family, subtly implied within.</p>
<p>"The green mountains do not rush after the flowing river, several shades of emerald gather at the edge of the forest after the rain. The fisherman's hut is far and blurred, the smoky village is half visible and half hidden. Da Chi (Huang Gongwang) wields his drunken ink, vying with autumn for the azure sky, cleansing the dust of silks and gauze, a nest for disorderly clouds." This is Wang Guoqi's inscription on Huang Da Chi's painting scroll. Guoqi, styled Delian, was from Wuxing. He excelled in contemporary Yuefu poetry. His lyrical style was elegant and unrestrained, pure as jade and clear as ice. Now his name is forgotten, and those who write about Wuxing rarely mention him, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>The Season When Azaleas Bloom</h3>
<p>— Li Yutian</p>
<p>He left on a dim morning,</p>
<p>A season when azaleas bloom all over the hillsides.</p>
<p>Before he left, he said: Let everything be arranged by fate,</p>
<p>Perhaps next year, when the azaleas bloom, I will return—</p>
<p>The days pass silently like water,</p>
<p>Slipping away, a year, two years...</p>
<p>Now, it is the season when azaleas bloom again,</p>
<p>But he has not returned, nor is there any news....</p>
<h3>Rubbing of a Han White Horse</h3>
<p>— Collection of Xu Weinan</p>
<h3>Willow Catkins</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>Willow catkins float all over my way back.</p>
<p>I smell the fragrance emitted by the white willow catkins.</p>
<p>I live in a deep, secluded green forest, a small scarlet building, ochre-colored windows, and sea-green curtains...</p>
<p>From the window, I see the willow catkins fluttered by the morning breeze; the white willow catkins, the pure willow catkins...</p>
<p>I have the heart to cherish those snowy white willow catkins, but I do not like their lack of firm will, floating aimlessly and falling arbitrarily.</p>
<p>When she leans weakly against my purple window with her pale hands, picking green branches and leaves, I tell stories of my childhood wanderings, until her embroidered colorful skirt is covered with scattered fallen flowers...</p>
<p>Ah, my story of suffering and drifting! I could not finish it in three days and three nights.</p>
<h3>Ode to Dreams</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>I am an ordinary person, and I have so many unattainable loves and desires. But dreams are the closest to everyone, so I have fallen in love with dreams.</p>
<p>It is also a loyal friend, attending to you with utmost care, heeding the commands of your emotions, giving you complete comfort, driving away your frustrations and worries.</p>
<p>So I cannot leave it. A dreamless night is equal to a sleepless night.</p>
<p>If you still hate it for deceiving you once, I should defend it. This kind of deception is well-intentioned and harmless. I ask you, where in life is there a true realm?</p>
<h3>Mark Twain</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>When the American writer Mark Twain was traveling in Europe, a British person stopped his carriage and complained: "Mr. Twain, I would rather pay ten pounds than read your Huckleberry Finn (Twain's famous fairy tale)." Twain was so surprised that he could not say a word, with his eyes wide open. The British person then laughed and said: "This makes me experience the joy of reading it for the first time again."</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 527</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Judging from Zishan's explanation, Shouyi and Hejian entered the bandit den only ten minutes or so after the four mischievous individuals finished their work. Apparently, when the sentries of the bandit nest returned, they discovered that Pingzi had been rescued, and chaos immediately erupted. They fired their guns randomly to boost morale and activated the sirens. This was nothing, but perhaps with such actions, they could fabricate rumors when reporting back to their superiors, to excuse their responsibility. This was a fixed method used by Japanese invaders when they encountered failure.</p>
<p>After Shouyi and Hejian finished observing the den, they gathered the mobilized personnel from all sides and explained what they had seen. Li Ming and the others felt that the two dens in Fahua and West Shanghai only confined two military training students, yet it took a lot of effort to destroy the dens. This situation seemed more serious. How could it be handled so lightly and successfully? They feared that things were not so simple and that there might be further developments. So they agreed to reassemble and temporarily break up into smaller groups, each returning to its base to await further news.</p>
<p>This time, Bai Ren Zhuang dispatched eleven people, and Fahua and West Shanghai dispatched six people to help Li Ming and Han Fang's men with their tasks. The four mischievous individuals should have waited for everyone to gather at the Bund before splitting up to attack Hongzhen. But they still insisted on being mischievous to the end, completing the task first. This style of work was originally inappropriate, but because they had succeeded every time before, even Xiaozhuang could not cope with them. It was not until the Japanese launched the Shanghai Battle on August 13th that Shouyi's elder brother, Yubai, and the five masterminds feared that these mischievous individuals would make mistakes. Then they asked the elder Mingjue from Xiaozhuang to set strict rules, and only then did they stay within bounds.</p>
<p>Hejian sat in the car, still feeling uneasy. He asked Shouyi to find a way to call Bai Ren Zhuang to inquire about the whereabouts of the four mischievous young ladies and the latest news about Pingzi. Zheng Yan said, "There will be public phones available when we get to the Bund. It's too late, and even though there are some places to borrow a phone along this route in Hongkou, it's ultimately inconvenient..."</p>
<p>This move was also anticipated by the four mischievous individuals. They had already made calls to the Grand Hotel, the Wansui Hall, and Bai Ren Zhuang, saying that the "play" had been completed and the results were very satisfactory. They asked Shouyi and the others to go to Bai Ren Zhuang for a "celebration."</p>
<p>At midnight, the elder Mingjue of Bai Ren Zhuang felt that Qingmu's mysterious circle was still somewhat playful, and was reliable yet not entirely reliable. Such actions to thwart the Japanese invaders' secret plans to launch a major invasion were of utmost importance. How could one rely solely on hypnosis and mentalism to plan such a grand strategy? So the old man divided the problem into two approaches:</p>
<p>The first approach was to let Pingzi continue to explore "mental transmission" according to what she had learned from Qingmu. At the same time, the elder Mingjue himself also applied mentalism in his own quiet room, "adding tallies to old games" to test whether it was effective. If a response occurred, he would compare the results with Pingzi's information to see if they were the same.</p>
<p>The second, more practical approach was for the five masterminds of Bai Ren Zhuang, along with Hejian Zhengyan and Shouyi, to carefully consider the secret communications collected by Hejian's side and the current situation, and then develop a practical plan of action. Zhengyan also prepared to take several minutes to run back to the telecommunications department to collect the secret messages received before midnight.</p>
<h3>Visiting Mei Lanfang (1)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Soon after returning to Shanghai after the war, I asked a friend to introduce me to Mr. Mei Lanfang. The next day, someone wrote about it in the "Free Talk" section of the Shen Bao and published a photo of him and me. I have long wanted to write an account of this visit myself. But because the meaning was profound and the words were deep, I hesitated several times. Tonight, the sound of the plum rain pattering against the window, and the silver light illuminating the wall, make for a good night to express my feelings. I cannot help but briefly describe my thoughts.</p>
<p>Visiting the famous Mr. Mei Lanfang was the first time in my life that I took the initiative to visit someone I did not know. Friends and relatives in Jiangnan, from whom I had been separated for ten years, might think that I had spent ten years wandering in the interior and had become a "opera fan" upon returning, and went to support the "King of Actors" immediately. But that is not the case at all. During my ten years of exile, my heart remained pure, and I remained a believer in art and religion. My love for Peking Opera is driven by my artistic heart, and my visit to Mei Lanfang is driven by my religious heart. This is truly a profound meaning, and one cannot be persuaded without reading the entire article.</p>
<p>My love for Peking Opera began a few years before the war, when the Green Edge Hall was newly built. We built a new house and bought a new phonograph. Most of the records were Western music, with a few Mei Lanfang records bought as decorations. Because during the May Fourth Movement, many people opposed Peking Opera and wanted to overthrow it, I read their articles and found them reasonable, and from then on, I looked down on Peking Opera. Unexpectedly, the Peking Opera music on the phonograph gradually attracted people, and I eventually stopped buying Western music records and only bought Peking Opera records, especially Mei Lanfang's records. It turned out that what the May Fourth intellectuals opposed was the decadent content of Peking Opera that contained feudal toxins, while what I loved was the exaggerated, symbolic, and clear form of Peking Opera—its music and acting. Western music is "harmonic," while Eastern music is "melodic." Peking Opera music fully embodies the characteristics of "melodic music." Just look: it has no harmony, no accompaniment (the huqin is only an accompanying instrument), and it does not even have minor scales or semitones. It relies solely on the seven notes of the major scale (do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti) to express various personalities such as Qingyi, Laosheng, and Hualian. Therefore, even if one is not familiar with the plot or understands the lyrics, one can still know the identity, character, and general outline of the plot from the music. It can be inferred that when the authors originally created these Xipi and Erhuang tunes, they must have had an unusually full understanding of the flavors of life, and at the same time, they must have had an unusually keen genius for describing music. Thus, they could extract the essence of various personalities such as virtuous mothers, good wives, loyal ministers, filial sons, brutes, and villains, and use exaggerated and symbolic musical descriptions to create refined and clear melodies that have been passed down unbroken to this day. Before the war, my love for Peking Opera was limited to sound, that is, I focused solely on its musical aspects. Therefore, I did not go to theaters, but specialized in collecting records. Most of the hundred or so records collected by the Green Edge Hall were sung by Mei Lanfang. In the winter of 1937, these records and the Green Edge Hall were destroyed together. After the victory, I replaced them, and now they are almost complete.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Jiao Da and Liu Si</h3>
<p>— Qiren</p>
<p>Scolding people should not just be a venting of anger. Besides venting, it must also have an educational purpose, only then will the meaning of scolding not be wasted.</p>
<p>Currently, because there are too many things that are unsatisfactory, everyone cannot hold back their anger and scold each other. It is not surprising, but if one only scolds, scolding until one is dazed and disoriented, it will backfire. Like the general populace often mentions in their writings, scolding Jiao Da in the Grand View Garden. After three cups of wine, his temper flares up, and he exposes the ugliness of his masters to his heart's content, saying that in the Grand View Garden, inside and out, there is nothing clean except for the two stone lions at the gate. It cannot be said that his words are wrong, but we do not want people today to have Jiao Da's attitude of venting and being done with it. Because people today are in the position of masters, not slaves, and are absolutely different from Jiao Da.</p>
<p>What we expect from those in the position of masters is that everyone should rather be Liu Si than Jiao Da. The Old Book of Tang records the story of Liu Ziyi:</p>
<p>"Liu Ziyi was intolerant of wrongdoing and directly pointed out people's shortcomings. His friend Li Boyao often said: 'Even though Liu Si scolds people, people do not hate him.'"</p>
<p>How could Liu Si achieve such a position? Because he was confident that he would not be scolded by others in the future after scolding them today. His scolding was completely out of good intentions, containing the utmost sincerity and reason for education. Those who listened to his scolding were not only willing but also happy to follow him. This is much better than Jiao Da's abuse, which, besides being smeared with a mouthful of horse manure, has no other gain. It seems much wiser.</p>
<p>Everyone should strive to learn from Liu Si's behavior and no longer regard themselves as Jiao Da. Although Jiao Da had also made great contributions to protecting the old master, he should not act like a drunk madman, only seeking temporary pleasure. He should think about the consequences and not make venting his ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Both the scolder and the scolded can start from love and reach the point of "not hating." This is what we sincerely hope for.</p>

<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>Many countries in Europe and Asia after the war hope to get help from abroad, but the King of Yemen simply refused other people's help.</p>
<p>Cairo, French News Agency, 2nd: "The capital of Yemen reports that King Iman of Yemen has refused the loan offered by the United States, on the grounds that this move would place Yemen's resources in the hands of Americans." Can we say that Iman is stubborn? Can we say he is ungrateful? Judging from the reasons for his refusal, it is not a rash and reckless move. His self-confidence seems very strong, feeling that there is no need to use the power of others to solve his own problems. The name of this country, Yemen, is too unfamiliar. Perhaps it does not have a significant relationship. We rarely see its name in the newspapers, and its situation is not very clear. But it can be asserted that he must have a "problem" at this stage, so someone "offered a loan." However, Iman resolutely refused it.</p>
<p>In our country, there are people who do not have enough to wear, do not have enough to eat, and even commit suicide because they cannot live. The scene of Lihua is still visible everywhere. This luxurious scene cannot cover up the tragic situation of the economic crisis, but makes this situation more sharply exposed. Therefore, there are many "problems." If someone gives us help at this time, we will of course welcome it. However, distant water cannot put out a nearby fire, so at this National Assembly, someone shouted out the emergency solution of "those with money contribute money," and someone also proposed the suggestion of "requisitioning large amounts of private idle capital." We do not have Iman's courage to refuse others from thousands of miles away, but the suggestions of the gentlemen of the National Assembly need to be supported. We not only express our support in the "newspaper bottom," but also hope that the government can implement this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Gratitude in Abundance</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>Five hundred atomic bombs can destroy the whole world</p>
<p>——Los Angeles, United Press Agency, someone said this at the closing session of the Atomic Energy Conference.</p>
<p>How fierce the atomic bomb is! The Hiroshima seedling appears. The islanders escape the disaster, feeling cold in their hearts!</p>
<p>Five hundred bombs thrown into the world, everyone is finished! Everyone is finished! Only heroes remain, triumphing beyond the heavens?</p>
<p>Note, the word "triumphing" is a pun.</p>

<h3>The English King's Tea Party</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>King George and Queen Elizabeth held a tea party at Buckingham Palace in London the other day, entertaining five thousand guests. This is a major event in British social circles, and everyone is proud to be invited. But what made the tea party so enjoyable was not the rich food and luxurious decorations, but just a cup of tea, a piece of cake, and the light and delightful music played by the band.</p>
<p>As a monarch, to entertain five thousand honored guests with such simple refreshments would be considered an extraordinary act of negligence in the East. If an ordinary person were to entertain guests in this way, they would be despised as stingy. But the King and Queen of England entertained their guests in this way. Here, we cannot assume the poverty of the royal family, because the King and Queen of England could fully afford to entertain guests luxuriously.</p>
<p>Here, there is a profound meaning contained.</p>
<p>This meaning is to tell the British people to be thrifty and to promote post-war recovery through thrift.</p>
<p>When we read the report of this tea party, what we thought of was that Britain is maintaining its democratic system with the civilian identity of its monarch. Before the law, the King and Queen of England are the most exemplary citizens who abide by the law. During the war, they received clothing ration coupons like ordinary people and got the same purchase points. After the war, they also responded to the Labour Party cabinet's call for thrift.</p>
<p>Looking back at ourselves, in our country, the common social customs are to flaunt luxury and extravagance to dazzle people, to flaunt luxury and extravagance to gain face. The extravagance of thousands of people is built on the poverty of hundreds of millions of people. Especially the upper classes are indulging in endless singing and dancing all year round, with garden parties and cocktail parties, with a little tea and a cup of wine.</p>
<h3>Congratulations to the Theatrical Community's Grand Gathering</h3>
<p>— Fengyun</p>
<p>I heard that the Audience Performance Company will also withdraw from the Lafayette Theatre at the end of June. After that, apart from the Lyceum Theatre, which can be borrowed occasionally, there will be no other theaters available for performing dramas.</p>
<p>Now, the eleven drama groups in Shanghai have decided to use the Haiguang Theatre as their permanent performance venue. In the face of such difficulties in borrowing theaters, we should congratulate all the drama groups in Shanghai, because they now have a common theater for performances.</p>
<p>The names of these eleven drama groups are: Shanghai Drama Arts Society, China Drama Arts Society, China Performing Arts Society, Shanghai Experimental Drama Society, New China Drama Society, Audience Performance Company, Municipal Drama School, Zhongwan Drama Troupe, Post Office Workers' Drama Troupe, Children's Drama Troupe, etc. The first performance will be the historical drama "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian, presented by the New China Drama Society, scheduled to officially open on the 11th, with a dress rehearsal on the evening of the 10th to entertain people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The Shanghai drama community has decided to hold a grand joint celebration on the 7th and 8th, day and night, to celebrate the grand unity of the drama community. The program for the two days is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Grand Chorus: China Music School.</p>
<p>(2) Recitation: Bai Yang, Tai Yi, Shu Xincheng, Yang Wei, Tao Jin, Li Jianwu, Jin Yan, Zhao Dan.</p>
<p>(3) Special Contribution: Tian Han, Cao Yu, Ouyang Yuqian, Xiong Foxi, Ying Yunwei, Zhou Boxun, Gu Zhongyi, Wu Zuguang.</p>
<p>(4) Solo: Lu Zhu Hong, Zhou Xuan, Zhu Qiu, Ouyang Jingru.</p>
<p>(5) Dance: Municipal Drama School: Qian Feng, Chang Guohui.</p>
<p>(6) Kunqu Opera: Zhao Jingshen. (7) Peking Opera: Jin Suqin, Cosmic Peak, Jin Suwen, Female Convict Released.</p>
<p>(8) Drama: "The Virgin's Heart" - Post Office Workers' Drama Troupe, "Before Breakfast" - Drama School. "The Landlady" - Zhongwan Drama Troupe. (9) Comedy: Yang Huasheng, Zhang Qiaonong.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the drama community will unite, work together, and strive for Chinese drama, and strive for the movement of Chinese culture!</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Feifei was being helped by a female troupe member, leaning next to the wicker chair imitating her mother, weeping with tears in her eyes, and several people coaxed her with sweets, but it was useless.</p>
<p>Lan勉qiang opened her eyes, glared at her, and wanted to say a lot to her, but the people on the station were so noisy that she really did not have the strength to raise her voice.</p>
<p>"Feifei, be a good girl, don't cry! In two or three days, you can be with your mother again!" The female troupe member helped to persuade.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, I'm afraid... I won't see Mom again..." The seven-year-old girl unexpectedly said something ominous.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian happened to be pulling Zhang Chang over. Hearing Feifei say this, he also felt very unhappy. He hurriedly bent down, held her mouth with his hand, and whispered in her ear: "Don't say that, Feifei, if you say that, Mommy and Uncle Zhu will not like you!"</p>
<p>But the child started crying even louder.</p>
<p>"Miss Zhu, please take her away for a while." Zhu Zhaonian, at a loss for what to do, could only use a coercive means to ask the female troupe member to take Feifei away immediately.</p>
<p>Lan silently sighed a breath.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian wanted to say a few words of comfort to Lan, but amidst a burst of noise, the four drivers, who were roaring and wielding the power of life and death, had issued the order to start the cars. Who dared to delay? The four cars immediately became a mess. The young Zhang Chang also began to panic. He also wanted to bravely rush forward, but immediately thought that he was traveling with a seriously ill female, and then stopped and looked back at Zhu Zhaonian, wanting to wait for him to decide.</p>
