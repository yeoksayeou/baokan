<h3>昨晨國務會議通過　訓政程序法案　延長各機關及參會行使職權日期　國大會期尙待明令決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕國務會議十二日晨由蔣主席親臨主持，除由王世杰報吿外交，秦德純報吿軍事外，並曾討論三要案，計：　訓政結束程序法草案，亦即渦渡辦法，決議通過，交立法院完成立法程序，於十二月卄五日公布施行。　建國特捐條例草案，經熱烈討論後，決議交經濟委會審査。　現任參政員之任期，延長至國大召開之日爲止。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕喧嚷已久之國大如期舉行與延期問題，十二日晨國務會議中已有明確決定，並對行憲開始後國大未舉行前之行政機關之行使職權問題有所規定，茲誌該案（按：本案係由主席交議者）如次：案由爲訓政結束程序法草案，議決：本年十二月廿五日爲行憲之期，但國大代表尙無法即行集會，約法旣經失效，行使政權之各種機關不能中斷，亦不能無法律根據，因擬訂過渡辦法，以資銜接，俟完成立法程序後，於十二月廿五日與定期召開國民大會之明令同時公布。茲經深悉，該項辦法內容約如下列：</p>
<p>甲·國府原有法令職權照常行使，至總統·副總統選出後停止。</p>
<p>乙·政院至總統任命新行政院院長後，現有之政院停止行使職權。</p>

<h3>徵收建國特捐　以勸導為原則　主席指示力求簡化藉免苛擾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕徵收建國特捐問題，十二日在國務會議中曾引起熱烈之爭辯。財長兪鴻鈞說明後，張繼·鄒魯·徐傅霖等均表反對，認爲所定條例限制苛嚴，如懲治盜匪之條例然，旋蔣主席並起立指示，勉以應力求簡化，藉免苛擾，並以勸導爲原則，當決交府委會經濟委會審査。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕建國特捐條例，經行政院會議通過後，十二日國務會議曾加討論，先由財政部長兪鴻鈞對此作一詳細解釋，此條例爲根據建國時期有錢出錢，有力出力之原則而擬訂者，所捐之財貨，亦根據全國同胞之財富多寡而定，並只爲一次之捐助，極盼全國同胞對此一致支持，以完成艱巨之建國任務。鄒魯·張繼及徐傅霖等發言時，均表示巽議，徐氏並謂：此關有「招搖」之嫌，蓋規定人民財產不論是不動產之房屋，妻子兒女之貴重首飾以及動產中之國內外銀行存款，有價證劵，公司股票等，均需自動申報，其中項目繁複，自不容易辦理，何况由各人自動申報更有問題，雖然採取密吿及過期不報者加以處罰之規定，但辦理多不易。最後，蔣主席亦會就此條例表示意見，討論結果，決　原案交財政部研究修訂，再行提會討論。按該條例草案中規定採用累進法，自五十億元起捐一億元，財富愈多所捐數目愈大，最後一級五千億元者，則捐獻全部財富百分之六十，至主特此事之機構，在中央設立建國特捐督導委員會，由參政會派代表二人及監察院·行政院等各派代表一人及財政·經濟等有關部門之政務次長等組成，而以行政院副院長爲主任委員，各省市則設立調查委員會，辦理調査各該省市人民之財產事宜。</p>

<h3>剩餘物資外銷　首批簽訂合同　目的在爭取外匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中區當局近爲加速處理留存太平洋各島上各項剩餘物資及廢鐵，特着行政院物資供應局，將留存湖島，塞班島，馬利亞納等十三島上無法利用之物資及廢鐵，移交中央銀行，俾便重行接洽外銷，以爭取外匯。</p>
<p>第一批廢鐵之外銷，業於十一日下午，在中央銀行正式簽訂合同。該批廢鐵，包括業已廢爛之船艇，吉普事，坦克等，該批廢鐵之噸位及價値幾何，尙無估計，惟該項廢鐵之承購權，已由簽訂合同之通　貿易公司取得，再行轉售予美國之貝斯來每姆鐲鐵公司。</p>
<p>該批廢鐵，將由美國輪船公司担任運輸工作，惟以數量龐大，據估計，可裝足一百船，如往返不斷，自各島陸續運送至美國東岸，前後需時十八個月。</p>
<p>外傳該批廢鐵共重十五萬噸，包括築路機等有用物資，又傳總値在美金三千萬元之　。負責簽約方面，對此均未能予以證實。惟斷言該批物資，確爲不能再供利用之廢鐵。至噸位價値，尙待實地勘察後，方能確定。聞中央銀行爲此，已派出若干人員，前往各島調查。</p>
<p>按我留存太平洋各島剩餘物資，大多係美國淸　戰時對我之債務而移歸我國者。美國政府對我國重行出售該項物資之一部份，認爲主權在我，美國固無從干涉</p>

<h3>陜西洛惠渠放水　田疇五十萬畝賴以滋潤</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者蕭同信大荔十二日電〕已故李儀祉先生策劃之陜西洛惠渠工程，經水利機關十三年之艱苦工作，已於景近竣工，今在大荔縣屬之義井村舉行放水典禮。蔣主席，孫副主席，張院長，及中樞各首長均頒有題詞。典禮於十二時半開始，此一荒僻小村，冠蓋雲集，盛况空前，附近農民歡欣若狂，奔走相吿，扶老携幼，咸來觀禮，水利部長薛篤弼開閘放水，祝主席夫人剪綵，洛河洪流遂於此盛典中，冲出邃長之鐵鐮山隧洞，而奔注新渠，從此朝邑，大荔，蒲城三縣民衆，將無虞涸旱，而廣達五十萬畝之田疇，亦賴以滋潤。據孰悉農事者談：今後每年當可增產小委十萬市石，豆榖雜糧七萬五千市石，棉花七百五十萬市斤，共約値國幣一五二五億元，土地本身並可增値二二五〇億元，每年可收水費六十億元，洛惠渠在關中八渠中並非最大者，但以時間及規模言，在全國所有水利工程中，奮首屈一指，此渠在漢武帝時開闢，達十三年之久，迄未成功，史載龍首渠即此，民卅三年後，經水利機關積極修築，始底於成，全部工程費用達六十五億餘元，總支渠計長九七，八六〇公里，第五號隧洞長三三七七公尺，湧泉流沙，工作極度艱險，今日觀成，誠非易易，趙守鈺顧問於致詞中謂：人力可以勝天，今人可以勝古，吾人今後應以護養自居，以保永全。典禮畢，前往工地參觀工程艱鉅，五時返義井，即開會追悼殉職員工。（洛惠渠最大跌水閘照片見二版）</p>

<h3>美衆院通過援外案　即由兩院聯會最後決定　對華援助或將另擬專案</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕美國衆院今日以口頭表決法，通過對中·法·義·奥四國過渡援助議案。</p>
<p>衆院所通過之法案，現將送交參衆兩院之會議委員會加以討論，以便調整兩院之不同點，而成立協議按衆院通過之援助議案，共五九〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，其中包括中法義奥四國，但參院之五九七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元援助案，則僅包括法·義·奥三國，而與中國在內。依據美國法規，凡遇兩院對同一問題，發現兩種不同議案時，應由兩院成立委員會，討論妥協方法，參加人數，兩院各佔其半。</p>

<h3>津浦路浦濟段通車</h3>
<p>繼浙　路金華戈陽間的通車及湘桂黔鐵路衡柳段的恢復交通以後，津浦路的浦濟段亦經修復。已於十一日首次順利恢復通車，並於昨日開會紀念。濟南及魯省，乃至整個華北的人士，對此無不表示歡忭。的確，我們不能忽視了此一段鐵道交通的恢復。津浦鐵路爲橫貫南北，綰繫四省的鐵道幹綫，乃長達一千零九公里的大動脈。自勝利以來，被共匪破壞，中斷通車達廿五個月之久。今春魯境國軍迅速推進，魯南各地相繼收復，搶修工作隨時開始，歷經險阻，卒使濟浦段完全修復，正式通車。對於鐵路當局的不辭艱險，努力搶修，我們自不能不首先表示佩慰。這搶修的工程是不易的：在物資及經昆山的又重艱困下，又加上沿綫局勢的尚未完全恢復平靖，在這種情勢下，努力於鐵道的搶修，卒能於短期內恢復濟南浦口間的交通，我們自不能不首先向津浦鐵路當局表示崇高的敬佩。</p>
<p>濟南浦口間鐵路交通的恢復，與津浦全顯然復通，誠然還有相當的距離。津浦路全綫的通車，雖然琮有待於異日；但由於浦濟段的通車，我們認爲有幾點，應該提請國人注意：　浦濟段的通車憶是一種非常的成就，此一通車所表示的就是不論共匪的破壞，政府卻不斷地在努力復興。政府對於復興的努力與共匪的破壞呈首一個強烈的對照。國人對此應該有一種新的覺醒：　浦濟段的通車使冀魯豫等華北省市，與中央的關係加強，具有一種強加向心力的作用。我們願華北人士觀乎浦濟段的通車，益能表示他們對於中央的忠誠；　由於浦濟段的通車，使南北物資得以暢流。在通車的當日，便有煤車兩列，將山東所產的煤運銷京滬，這對於解救京滬的煤荒，顯然是能收直接效果的。此外，其它的物資，亦可能由浦濟段的通車而收貨暢其流的實效。此則對於我國民族經濟的復蘇，關係自非淺鮮。</p>
<p>由於浦濟段的通車，我們願津浦全綫也能在最近的將來恢復交通。浦濟段已占津浦全綫的三分之二，則其它三分之一的交通，恢復自或較易。但鐵路交通的恢復，其因素原非盡能爲鐵路當局所控制，則如何恢復津浦路南北幹綫的交通，還有望於其它的軍政當局和一般人民的協力。我們願由於軍民的協力，此一南北幹綫的交通，能夠得以早日恢復！</p>
<h3>抑平物價的另一措施——配給</h3>
<p>跟著發行大票而來的種種緊急措施，如加強金融管制，改進紗花布的管理，以及限制匯款，停止貸放，抽緊銀根，限制提現，嚴查囤積，取締抬價，拋售物資等，均在　　進行，或加緊實施中。惟推廣配給一點，雖於經濟戡亂辦法中，並有規定，經當局認爲同是抑平物價，安定民生的要著；但截至最近，尚未見有何行動。這理由是很淺顯的：眞正辦理配給，必須把握住全部的物資，獲得正確可靠的統計，以全國爲對象，同時舉辦，設立育分有效的總分去機構，方纔可以行之有效。</p>
<p>因爲所以要辦配給的原因，不外兩點：　物資不充，要拿全國所有準備配給的全部物資來，統盤籌劃，作公平合理的分配。其著重在量的方面，即所謂均貧政策；　限定配價，根絕黑市，以安定民生。其所重在價的方面，即所謂平價政策。因此全部的物瘓，如果掌握不住，便不能作統盤的籌劃；只辦局部，而不能從全國全盤舉辦，亦無從作統盤的籌劃，沒有全國可靠的數字，更無從作統盤的籌劃；沒有充分有效的總分去機構，便沒有人能担荷起這項統盤籌劃的責任來。</p>
<p>美國正在商請國會，恢復從前的配給計劃。但其恢復工作，據聞至少非三個月不辦；就是爲範圍太大，其準備物資，組織，數字等項，過於複雜故。</p>
<p>英國亦是全面配給的，其中糧食一項，每年即須從國庫中貼補近乎四億鎊之鉅，就爲抑平物價，安定民生，非貼補　辦故。牠又是一個糧食為立即的國家，還得由國家多方設法，輸入糧食，以資分配。否則，其最低的定時，無從維持　黑市必將猖獗，甚且危及其配給制度的本身故。</p>
<p>依據上面這些例子，我們可以知道：　單　局部配給，無法掌握住全部物資，斷不能消滅黑市，穩定物價；　同一個區域之內，單辦部分配線，其餘一　不管，更不能掌握住全部物資，亦即是根本無法消滅黑市，穩定物價；　所辦部分的配給，如果定量太低，無法維持其最低限度的需要，或其期間太不準確，無以供給其經常必需的消費，那就無異鼓勵黑市，造成黑市；　無論全部配給，或局部配給，其配價如須依據進本爲伸縮，而不準備予以貼補，則穩定物價的原意，便無從實現；　物資太缺乏時，不從疎導來源入手，而只以面前所可獲得的現存物資爲限，決不足以維持其定時與定期；　所配的對象，與經辦的機構，如果因陋就簡，過於粗疎，勢必要消弱其配給的將臨。</p>
<p>現在辦理配給的，除公敎人員的實物配給外，還只限於上海一埠，且只限於上海一埠的某部分。經辦的人，雖盡了最大的努力，但以上面所舉種種條件，未能完全具備；其最大的成果，亦只能辦到某部分人的特惠，即獲得配給的人，可獲得某種平價貨而已。其貨量如果不夠用，仍須求之於黑市，凡不能享受此項特惠的人，更須求之於黑市，而沒有辦理配給的地方，當然談不到所謂平價貨。結果是　物資的盈絀，非但各地不等，即在同一區域以內，亦豐　縣殊；　物價的漲風，投機的活躍，與民生的不安定，始終沒有澈底制止的辦法。仍舊拿上海來說：米是局部配給的，但米市的瘋狂如故；糖是普徧配給的，但配價議價之外，黑市的猖獗如故，其他如煤球，食油，人造絲，棉紗等等，均有其不同方式的配售或配給，亦均有其五花八門的黑市。這不一定是配得不得法，亦不一定是取締查察的不嚴密，而實是計劃未周，漏洞太多的緣故。</p>
<p>但看各國配給制度的盛行，與美國舊調的重彈，可知這個制度，在抑平物價，與安定民生這一點上，確是一個最合理，也是最有效的辦法。不過我們見解，倘若偷工減料，枝枝節節地做，是斷然無效的。所以配給制度的推廣，其所以遲遲我行，未見實施，倒用不著焦急或失望。據傳中央爲實施配給起見，曾有聘請英國專家之義。昨中央社消息，英糧食部助理秘書赫特氏即將應聘來華，爲糧食部顧問。可見以後辦理配給，中央亦或將進一步，採取縝密有系統的辦法；以期達到抑平物價，安定民生的目的。我們見到現在有許多病急亂投醫的辦法，紛紛擾擾，弄得經濟界的混亂情形，愈陷愈深，對於這種根本上改進的準備工作，不禁寄以甚深的期待。</p>

<h3>日賠償工具機待運</h3>
<p>（上接一版）賠償委會重要決定如下：</p>
<p>一，通過日本賠償物資接運計劃，其要點爲確定接收機構及各機關應籌辦之工作：　日港口方面交船裝運工作，由駐日代表團接收委會負責處理，　我港口方面：A，由承受物資各部會設置接收機構，B，交部賠償物資運輸處成立辦事處，C，規定各港口舉行接運賠償物資聯　會，由上述各機構負責人參加，而以督運委會駐港代表主持之。</p>
<p>二，通過港口日本賠償物資交換手續，以免臨時紊亂。</p>
<p>三，日本賠償物資分運我國港口頗多，惟大部仍以運達上海爲終點，首批輪船運來之賠償物資亦決定以上海爲到達點，故上海之準備工作尤爲重要，其準備情形如次：　各部會在滬設接運機構，已由各部會照辦，　交部日本賠償物資運輸處滬辦事處處牠由招商局胡副經理時淵兼任，　滬接運聯運會議，由賠償委會督運委會聘請招商局胡副經理爲駐滬代表主技，定每星期三召集。滬各部分接運機構負責人舉行聯繫會議，　上海各部會準備工作大體均已就緒，　招商局已預定先派「海康」，「海浙」兩輪赴日接運，並經賠償委會將兩輪情形電告駐日代表團，就近與盟總交涉入境手續，一俟准予入境電報到達，立可駛日，　賠償物資進口已由賠償委會呈政院核准發給通用許可證，並予免稅，所有應辦手續，亦經分別洽妥，依上述準備情形，如裝箱工作進行迅速，首批九四四九年工具機，兩個月即可運完。首批派日本運賠償物資之船隻，本月內可以到滬。</p>
<h3>「解總」駐滬人員昨飛津轉匪區</h3>

<p>關於林仲之行動，行總昨特發表聲明，表示對其安全不再負責，稱「依據約定：「解總」辦事處結束後，的有該處人員，應即全體安全護送返還匪區，乃林代表突自行他往，臨行致函聯總，謂將逕往香港，顯係違背約定，本署對林氏行動安全所負之責任，已因其違約行爲而不復存在矣」。</p>
<p>又據聯部發言人告記者稱：林仲之未曾一同飛津轉返匪區，乃由其致函聯總，聲稱「自動」不去者，故聯總對其今後之安全問題，亦不負責。至聯總在匪區之工作人員七名，依據雙方約定，在「解總」人員撤返後，亦可南返，此約定當不致因林仲個人「自動」不返，而受影響，至於此七人何日返滬，當由渠等自去決定，因渠等恐願在工作完畢後再撤離。</p>

<p>至聯總分配漁輪一項，該發言人稱，聯總目前暫時不能將漁輪售與漁商，乃因中國使用漁新式輸之技術人員缺乏，一時不能利用。此外，別無其他原因。漁管處現正積極訓術靑年技術人員二百五十三人，敎以使用新式漁輪一百二十六艘上各項機械之使用。彼等均努力學習，成績相當完滿。一俟學習期滿，即可隨同新漁輪分配與漁商。前在復興島漁管處教授技術人員之外籍人員計一百八十人，現均陸續返國，至明年一月一日僅擬留五十人在善後委員會主持之漁管處工作。而目前中國人員在漁輪上工作者，以及機械人員，已達六百八十五人，聯總爲訓練中國漁業人員並復興中國漁業，特撥款達美金二千六百萬元。</p>

<h3>標賣敵屋限期遷讓十萬住戶羣情皇皇　組織聯誼會呼籲各界同情援助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市八千家以上之敵屋住戶，近因中信局將執行標賣政策，而在政府訂定之辦法中，規定住戶須限期遷讓，羣感恐慌，特組織敵屋住戶聯誼會，於昨日午後三時假靑年會九四六室，招待法律，經濟專家及新聞界人士，請求對此問題發表實見，並予以同情支持。出席者除住戶代表五十餘人外，端木愷。周一志。吳承禧等均列席發表意見。</p>
<p>先聲明立塲無任何背景</p>
<p>昨日招待會之主席爲閘北區衛生事務所所長劉德健，首先說明住戶均爲後方復員來滬之公敎人員，現住房屋均由配給而來，以上海房荒之嚴重，此時旣無力遷讓，亦無力購買住屋，如中信局執行標售政策，則十萬餘人流離失所，熟將影響社會安定。住戶目前所爭者爲使用權，不反對政府之政策，聯誼會之組織，絕無任何政治或黨派背景。</p>
<p>訂立保管據係片面約束</p>
<p>尋則提出三項間題：　房租與中信局所收之保管使用費有何區別？　標賣政策對財政究有各大補助，有無變通辦佚？　敵屋標售政策一再變更，請與會人員硏究，並提出意見。討論開始後，各住戶代表熟烈發表意見，歸納其要點爲：　保管使用費在法律上無根據，故其性質實與租金並無區別。常初中信局要求居戶訂立「保管據」，書明隨時可收回房產，並加收使用費，而不用房租之名，實爲一種片面之約束。依理而言，住戶爲中信局保管敵產，按理不須再出使用費，旣出此項類似房租之費用，而租貨權又無保障，實與上海一般習慣不合。</p>
<p>住戶使用權應仍予保留</p>
<p>數逾十萬之居民，如強迫於一個月內澀讓，於社會安寗必有重大妨碍，且將使本市之房荒更形嚴重，故希望政府能改變辦法，將標賣展期辦理，或將標賣權與使用權分開，敵屋儘可標售，但住戶應保留使用權。　改變目前之標售政策爲住戶優先承售，如住戶能力不及，應維持現狀，但爲增加財政收入計，不妨將押租及租金合理提高。　如爲增裕國庫而拍賣敵僞住屋，應儘先標售正金銀行百老匯大厦及奮法租界之要人住宅，不應尃在虹口區之弄堂房子上打主意，否則有失公允。</p>
<p>對財政無補向政院訴願</p>
<p>尋由參加招待會之專家致辭，周一志律師貢獻意見，認爲聯誼會應在中信局執行之前，先將訴願呈文送呈行政院，並指出本月一日立法院所公布之房屋租賃條例，其立法精神即在保護住戶，而敵屋住戶極大多數爲復員之公敎人員，戰時追隨政府西遷，歷盡辛苦，此時應得政府之維護。端木愷律師繼起發言，謂政府與人民在公的關係之外，私的方面應居於平等地位看，人民居住敵屋政府機關居住敵屋，在處理時應用同樣辦法，方爲公允。吳承禧發言時，反對目前之標　政策，不論工業或住宅，認爲對財政補助均不甚大。過去之敵僞產業，理應由國家經營，而不必分開拍賣，徒利豪門。至於拍費敵屋，尤覺不必，因今年上半年之佔價，敵屋不過二千億元至三千億元，今日至多不過一萬億。目前政府每月支出五萬億，不過一星期之用途而已。故與其出售，不如酌增房租爲佳。討論至此，已逾五時，主席先對列席人士致謝，並歸納各項管線，表示即日將向行政院訴願，遂則宣告散會。</p>

<p>文史　胡適題記鐵琴銅劍樓翟氏藏　明鈔本水經注  胡適　　民國三十六年九月五日，我同徐森玉先生去訪問常熟瞿家兄弟，見　　旭初先生，承他　出他家鐵　銅劍樓舊藏的明鈔本水經注來給我們看。我當時寫了一點筆記，回到北平之後，才寫這篇題記。　　現存的明鈔宋本，我見到的只有這三部是完全的：　　　永樂大典本　　　常熟瞿氏藏本　　　海鹽朱氏藏本　　此三本之中，大典本最究整，瞿本與朱本都有許多錯葉。瞿鳳起先生曾用大典本校勘，訂正瞿本的錯葉錯簡。我去年跋朱本，也曾指出其中卷三十八就有十四葉是錯亂了的。我所見的明鈔木水經注，除本典本之外，都是騎縫沒有記明卷數葉數的，所以都最容易有錯葉錯簡。（天津圖書　藏的練湖書院鈔本水經注殘本，也是明鈔宋本，也沒記卷　數。）　　　本用藍絲闌鈔寫，半葉十行，每行二十字，但也有每行二十二三字的。分裝十二册，每册首　有「海隅」印，又有「吳省欽印」「白華」印。徐森玉先生與趙　雲先生都說「海隅」是徐學謨。徐學謨是嘉靖廿九年進士，生於嘉靖元年（一五二二），死於萬曆廿一年（一五九三）。吳省欽生於雍正七年（一七二九），死於嘉慶八年（一八六三）。徐學謨有海隅集七十九卷，又曾修湖廣總志九十八卷。瞿氏此本出於他家，是一部十六世紀的鈔本，其鈔寫年代與大典重鈔的時代，與黃省曾刻水經注（一五三四）的時代，都相去本遠。（鐵琴銅劍樓藏書目錄卷十一，葉十四，記此本，僅記「吳省欽印」「白華」二印，未記「海隅」一印。）　　瞿本有　道元自序，中間缺了半葉二百二十字。柳大中鈔宋本也有此序，也缺這半葉。此可見瞿本與柳大中本大槪同出於一個來源。朱本與黃省曾刻本都沒有　序。大典則有此序全文。　　卷六澮水篇引古文瑣語一段，黃省曾本（葉十二）是這樣的　　…公問師曠對首陽之神　　有大　身狐尾其名日者飲酒朱本與瞿本（瞿本此處有錯簡）均與黃本相同，均作「有大」（大是犬之誤），均作「其名曰者」。傅沅叔先生所藏宋刻殘本也如此。大典本也作「有大」，但「其名日」之下，旁注一「闕」字。（太平御覽卷四十引此文「其名日之下空五個字。）　　用上述兩項標準，可知大典本與諸本的來源似不相同。　　大典本有全文　　柳大中本與　本此序皆　　黃省曾本與朱　本皆無此序　　　　水篇「其名曰者」大典本作「其名曰　者」　　瞿本與朱本作「其名日者」　　黃本本作「其名曰者」　　卷八濟水篇記范巨卿　，黃省曾本（葉十九）作「范巨卿　，名件猶存」。　本與朱本與大典本都作一名件」，南宋洪适隸釋引此文，亦作「名件」。（殘宋本此處已殘缺。）吳琯刻本始　改「名件猶存」爲「石柱猶存」，米謀　　元春項細黃晨皆依吳　本作「石柱」。全謝山趙東潛亦作「石柱」。戴柬原兩本皆從古本作「名件」。「名件」是一個名詞，至今　州尙通行。吳　本妄改，　無版本的依據。　　卷十六　水　記千金　的工程最詳細，黃省曾本（葉六）此　有這一句話：　　後張方入洛，破千金　，公私賴之。　　破了千金　，何以公私反「賴之」呢？此語不合情理，故全謝山趙東潛戴東原諸家都參考太平御　及晋書，在「公私賴之」之上增補李矩袁孚修復千金　的事。今檢大典本，此句作　　後張方入洛破千金　公斯頓立　　朱本與大典本相統。瞿本此句作　　後張方入洛破千金　公私頓立　　此下文爲「水積年渠頹毁石砌殆盡遺基見存」。我們看了大典本與朱本作「公私頓之」，又看了瞿本作「公私頓立」，當然可以悟到此句原本作「公私頓乏水」，全文當讀：　　後張方入洛，破千金　，公私頓乏水。積年渠　頹毁，石砌殆盡，遺基見存。朝廷（北魏）太和中修復故　。　　如此校讀，就不須增補文字了。晋書惠帝妃云：　　太安二年…十一月辛已…張方決千金　，水碓皆涸，乃發王公奴婢手春給兵　。　　此可以爲證。瞿本的「頓立」更近於「頓乏」，更可供校勘。　　　本是幾個鈔手分鈔的，工拙稍不同，精疎也不同。有時瞿本勝於朱本，如卷三記酒泉延壽孫南山的石油一段，瞿本作：　　傳物志稱酒泉延壽縣南山出果水大如　，注地爲溝，水有肥，如肉汁。取者器中，始黃後黑，如凝膏。然極明，　骨無異。膏車及水　缸甚佳。方人謂之石勝。，「凝膏」誤作「疑膏」，皆不如瞿本。末句朱本作「方人謂之石石漆」，瞿本不重「石」字，而「漆」字誤作「勝」，則互有　　但有時　本不如朱本。如卷　四　水篇，引馬第伯書，中有　　其爲高或以爲小伯石或以為冰雪　　朱本與大典本相同。瞿本作　　其爲高或以爲小伯石或以爲水爲　　　作「冰雪」是也。此十四字，費省曾刻本改作　　其爲高也如視浮雲，　　　峻石壁　條。　　此是依劉昭補設續漢書祭　志所引，但實非宋本原文。孫潛校本引柳大中本，與大典及朱本相同。可見黃刻本以前的古本都如此，其中「伯石」是「白石」之誤。（參看戴東原本校改此條的文字。）　　永經注宋刻本今日已無全本，幸有大典本與　氏朱氏兩家所　明鈔宋本尙首尾完全。黃省曾刻本的錯葉十四處，脫葉兩處，此三本皆不誤。大典本的底本最妙，但今所存是重抄本，頗有小脫誤，應該用這兩部明鈔本來細細校勘，加上殘宋本十一卷有零的校勘，方才可以還原一部宋本水經注。瞿本有徐海隅的印章，其鈔寫至晚在嘉　萬曆之間，其所保存的　道元自序殘本與柳大中本相同，故似更早於朱氏所藏鈔本。（卅六，九，十三夜半）與盧翼野先生論「排擋樂次」  閻自鍔　　盧冀野先生編著的「中國戲劇概論」（上海世界書局出版）第三章「宋戲之繁盛」中有這樣的一段話：　　「周密武林舊事上有「排當樂次」者，就是現在」戲單」的濫觴。又有些像演戲的幕表。」　　這段話所根據的材料是武林舊事卷一：「天基聖節排當樂次』：　　「初坐樂奏　　起上林春引子王榮祖　第一盞　　起萬歲梁州曲破齊如賢舞頭豪　邁舞尾范宗茂　第二盞　　起臨壽永歌曲子陸恩顯琵琶棒瑤巵慢王榮祖　第三盞玉軸琵琶獨彈壽永康寗兪達伯王良卿　　起慶壽新周潤　談子笛哨潘俊　鼓朱饒卿拍王良卿進念致語　第五盞　獨吹長生寶宴樂侯璋拍張亨笛起降聖樂慢寗雜劇周朝淸以下做三京下書斷送　池遊　第六盞箏獨彈聚仙歡陳儀拍謝用方響起堯階樂慢劉民和進聖花金寶　第七盞王方響獨打聖壽永余勝拍王良卿　起出墻花慢吳宣雜手藝祝壽進香仙人趙喜，」（　案以上照錄盧先生所引原盧先生所引用的武林舊事是什麽本子，沒有註明。我們若拏幾種本十的武林舊事做一比較，便可知道他所用的一定是上海進步書局的有光紙本。依據這樣的本子而不知取別種本子稍加參校，則其中所有的錯誤是應當由　先生負其責的。今將知不足　叢書本的武林舊事所載抄在下面，以與盧書所引作一比較：　　「初坐樂奏夷則宮盛　起上林春引子王榮顯　　第一盞　起萬歲梁州曲破齊舞頭豪俊邁舞尾范宗茂　　第二盞廣葉起聖壽永歌曲子陸恩顯　　琵琶起捧瑤巵慢王榮顯　　第三盞唱延壽長歌曲子李文慶　　稽琴起花梢月慢李松　　第四盞玉軸琵琶獨彈正黃宮福壽永康寗兪寗　　拍王良卿　　盛　起慶壽新周潤　　進彈子（宋刻譚子笛哨　　潘俊　　杖鼓宋堯卿　　拍王良卿　　進致語等時和　　伏以華樞紀節，瑤　先五日之春，王歷發祥，聖世啓干齡之運，歡騰薄海，慶溢大廷，恭維　　皇帝陛下　哲如蕘…恭陳口號　　上聖天生自有眞，千齡寶運紀休辰，　　瑞彩昭璇象，滿室紅光　翠　，黃　淸夷瑤莢曉，未央閒暇玉巵春，　　五福咸數歛，　極躬持錫庶民·　　日遲　　，壹聆舜樂和，天近鵝　，宜進齊之伎，上奉天　，吳師賢以下，上進小　劇。　　雄劇吳師賢以下做君聖臣賢　斷送萬萬聲第五盞…」（未完）石鼓文刻於　秦靈公三年考  唐蘭　　詛楚文有六個「我」字，三個「梧」字，「我」「梧」的界限不狠淸楚，也沒有「朕」字。　　秦公　羅振玉以爲穆公時，郭沫若以爲景公時，　銘說：「十有二公，郭說大概可信。可見在景公（紀元前五七六——五三七）時還用「朕」字而不用「避」或「梧」，到了惠文王時因五國擊秦而作的詛楚文（紀元前三一八），却用「梧」而不用「朕」了。石鼓文和詛楚文接近，它的時代決不會更在秦公　以前的　公文或穆公文是狠淸楚的。　　　秦公　秦公鐘沒有「毆」或「也」。在春秋以前的銅器裏就沒有見過道類字。春秋末年的陳常陶釜才有」也」，石鼓才兩用「毆」字。詛楚文的亞馳本巫成本說：「以自救　」湫淵本作「也」。新　虎符用「毆」字，秦權量用「也」字，也偶作「毆」。可見石鼓應在春秋末年後。　　　兩周金文不用「予」字，石鼓文「迂」字偏旁從「予」。　　由於這些證據，我們可以指出石鼓文應在春秋年末後。但是它稱「公」而不稱「王」並且拿商鞅量來比較，字體繁複得多，所以應該在秦孝公前，就是從西元前四八一（陳常弒簡公相平公的一年）到西元前三六一（秦孝公元年）之間。　　石鼓出於天興縣三畤原，即今鳳翔縣，是秦時雍邑。史記正義在秦本紀　畤下引括地志說：　　「三時原在歧州雍縣南二十秦文公作　畤，襄公作西畤，靈公作吳陽。　　上畤，並此原上，因名也。」　　過去學者大都認刻石和作畤有關，所以總把它放在文公或　公時。據我看刻石確和作時有關，（另有詳考），但時代是錯的。據封　書，襄公居西而作西畤，西畤決不會在雍邑，上面所引括地志是錯的。正義在密畤下引括地　　「漢有五畤在岐州雍縣南，則　畤，吳陽上畤，下畤，密畤，北畤。」　　並沒有西畤。北畤是漢高祖補立來祭黑帝的，原來四畤，　畤祭白帝，密時祭靑帝，吳陽上　祭皇帝，下　祭炎帝。四時中密　在渭南，那麼，雍楠的三時原應該只是　畤和吳陽上下畤。　　上面我已指出石鼓文所用的文字決不再春秋時，所以把它說成　畤的刻石或附會做陳　之類，顯然是錯誤的。但是，這十個刻石出在三　原上有什麽意義呢？記得徐旭生先生說這種大石不是鳳翔出的，在渭水南陳倉一帶卻常見。那麼，費很大的事，把這種大石運到湃雍之間區刻銘，所為何事？　　從文字的比較，我斷定石鼓，這一百二十年裏面，秦國在雍　只有一件大事，就是靈公三年這是從德公鬥雍，宣公作密時以後，隔了二百五十年才作的。這兩個畤就在三畤原上，也就是石鼓出土的地方，那麼，這十個刻石是因為作上下時而作是決無疑陽，這是秦人把汗水所出的湃山　做吳山的緣故，所以銘辭　有於歧陽，所以牽涉到周成王的岐陽之蒐，又附會上大統十一年的西　歧陽，太平眞君七年的禮田歧陽，加入知道這是吳陽，就不用如此紛紜了。在銘辭裘又說到「嗣王」，秦靈公三年是周威烈王的四年，也是新即位，當然可以稱嗣王了。　　石鼓文無論如何，不像是三百篇同時的作品，現在定為靈工三年，已是戰國初期，就無怪於它和穆天子傳裏的詩相類了。古代史裏，戰國初期的史料是最缺乏的，石鼓文正可以補這個空。如其我們八秦器排成：　　　秦景公時的　和鐘，　　　秦靈公三年刻石，即石鼓　　　秦孝公時的商鞅量和　，　　　秦惠文王時的刻石，　楚文，　　　秦始皇未統一以前的金刻，呂不韋和新　虎符，　　　秦始皇統一天下以後的權量和刻石。　　這是在是太　合了。學者們總是把石鼓推得太早，我的說法抑低了三百多年。我們希望這是最眞實的歷史年代，儘管不是周成王，周宣王，或者秦　公，秦文公，秦穆公等比較有名的王公時代的作品，它在歷史上的價值，是不會有絲毫貶損的。（完）說五更轉  王重民　　敦煌出的「五更轉」，約有二十來個寫本。可惜我在巴黎和倫敦所鈔的都丟了，現在先把柬方所有及所傳鈔的一些本子來校寫。如倫敦藏的荷澤和尙「五更轉」等，我還帶來照片，等整理好了再補寫。　　現在已經校寫了的「五更轉」，有下列六種：　　一·太子五更轉（兩卷伯二四八三　又三〇八三）　　二·太子入山修道讚（兩卷伯三〇六五傳蕓子先生五更調的演變引用李木齊舊藏本。）　　三·南宗定邪正五更轉（兩卷露字六號鹹字十八號）　　四·南宗讚（兩卷周字七十號伯二九六三）　　五。無題（一卷伯二大四七）　　六，　五更（一卷一羅　玉　敦煌零拾數天成二年寫本。）　　把一夜分成五更，顏氏家訓書證篇追溯他的根源很詳細。他說：　　「或問：一夜何故五更？更何所訓？　　答曰：漢魏以來，謂爲甲夜，乙夜，丙夜，丁夜，戊夜，一云鼓：一鼓，二鼓·三鼓·四鼓，五鼓·亦云一更，二更，三更，四更，五更。皆以五爲節。　　西都賦亦云：衛以嚴更之署　　所以爾者：假令正月建寅，斗柄夕則指寅，曉則指午矣。自寅至午，凡歷五辰。冬夏之月，雖復長短參差，然辰間遼闊，盈不過六，縮不至四，進退常在五者之間。更，歷也，故曰五更爾。』　　顏氏　想說明漢代已有五更之分，　要指出西都裏已有管五更的衙門。他想說明的這兩點，我們還有別的史料作旁證。漢書卷九十六西域傳上罰寶國傳，載杜欽說大將軍王鳳：有「斥候百餘人，五分夜擊刁斗自守」的話。那是在漢成帝的時代。（紀元前三二——七）又漢書卷二十六天文志，記星辰在夜間的移動，本始元年（七三）用過甲夜，地節元年（六九）用過乙夜。這明明可以追溯到西漢的末年。　　可是「五更轉」的歌調起於何時？還沒有人探究過。在顏之推的時代，有伏知道「從軍五更轉」五首，好像是　　最古的「五更轉」了。　　伏知道的「從軍五更轉」，正是五夜守更的斥候們，擊　刁斗歌唱的五古五　。我先在王　的　客業書卷十八讀到三首，後承向覺明兄告知郭茂倩的樂府詩集卷三十三，把那五苜完完全全的載錄着。王楙說：「今敎坊以五更演爲五曲，爲街市唱，」從宋代以後，就再沒有那樣壯烈曲辭了。但在明代情曲最盛行的時候，于謙却倣作了五首「從軍五更轉」，今見于節　詩集卷三。　　在敦煌時代，「五更轉」的詞調，有用五言的，有用七言的，有用一句三言三句七言的，更有在三句七言之後，再加上四句三言和兩句七言的。總之：都是用第一句的末一字來引韻。還有一點我們應該注意的，就是敦煌所出的多半是佛曲。可是「五更轉」的調子常是我國土產，釋子們依曲製詞，借用來宣揚他們的宗敎。　　在長短句的詞和小令盛行以後，五更傳的結構。又隨着時調生了變化。雍熙樂府卷十五頁二十二，選了用銷金帳的調子來寫「悲思」的五首五更轉。又同卷頁十一選了用楚江情兼金字經的調子來寫「盼望」的五首。所調「楚江情兼金字經」者是每更兩首相運，第一首是楚江情，然後用迴文詩的體例，銜接第二首的金字經。這和敦煌時代的「五更轉」，先用一句三言三句七言，再連接四句三言兩句七言，是一樣的體例。茲錄第一首如下：　　「一更夜氣淸，瑤　零。奴家等得燈半昏，強將針指秘多情·才郞薄倖，全無志誠，今宵那得花逕行，冷冷淸淸，撇得孤　靜，紅鴛被怎溫？紅鴛被怎溫，靑鸞　未諧，感起相思病體柴，一更裏來不來？斜倚銀箏淚滿腮，淚滿腮，喬才成分外。風流　，姻緣薄怎揩？」　　我所以寫出這第一首全文的原因，是想當作一例。因爲明崇偵間　隱居士選的白雪齋選定樂府吳騷合編卷二，又把這五首「五更轉」選入了，可是把題目改爲「閩怨」而注明是「古調」。又把調名標爲羅江怨，注云：「即羅帶風，又名楚江情。」指明他所標的是當時的調名，如果往上推究起來，楚江情羅帶風羅江怨都是一個調子。現在我更依吳騷合編鈔第一首如下：　　〔香羅帶〕一更夜氣淸，瑤　露零。殘燈隱隱昏復明，强將針指度閒情也。思量薄倖，全無志誠，今宵那搭花徑行？〔一江風〕撇得人冷冷淸淸，門掩孤　靜，紅鴛被似氷；紅鶯被似水，靑鸞夢米成，又感起相思病。」明代的羅江怨是由香羅帶和一江風拚合成的。現在我們知道了較平的楚江情兼金字經，便知道香羅帶爲什麽還有一江風了。以上都是論調子的變化。末了，我還要總結一句，五更是僅用來作叙述的序次，則從伏知道　今日，都是一樣的。（民國三十六年十月三十一日）</p>

<p>自由談憶百靈廟之捷  　　上月下旬元首蒞北平，召集將星會議，又命傅將軍單獨進見長談一小時半之久，其時外間即傳說傅氏將膺大任，至本月朔日，果有五省總司令之新命。事實上，此時此地此人，可云「相需甚亟」，羣眾固當拭目以待。　　傅氏對外用兵之奇蹟，在事變之前一年（二十五年）百靈廟一役，直搗日寇與蒙匪聯合之老巢，抄獲大宗之武器與秘册，爲非常痛快之驚人表現，始創敎訓強敵之紀錄。　　那年日寇正在華北跋扈飛揚，氣燄薰天，在冀東造成「小傀儡」（即股汝耕的自治政府），而宋哲元的冀察政委會又何嘗不在強敵壓迫之下，華北人民胸坎，被敵氛窒息得喘不過氣來，聽得綏軍捷報，驚喜欲狂，學界要慶祝遊行，報界要演慰勞義務戲，但都被冀察委會勸止了。老宋有老宋的難處，人亦諒之。其冬，傅將軍由綏飛平，老宋不敢親到機塲迎接，而且不敢公宴款待，只約到私室作杯酒之聯歡。此情此景，如在目前。　　「七七」事變後，華北淪陷，日寇把平北延慶以北由張家口而歸綏以西，割爲「蒙疆」，設僞蒙疆政府於張家口，又把綏遠改各「厚和」，又用成吉斯汗紀年，種種怪把戲，現在是一掃而光了。長城一帶，但見傅家軍屹如山立，如新的萬里長城。五坊使  季庸　　歷代處置貪官都不够痛快，這裏有兩個可能的原因。皇帝是第一個貪汚者，醫如漢靈帝就幹過「開西邸賣官」的勾當，近代當然得數西太后，迎日所記孝欽與老恭王的事，可見一斑。明亡時宮中存銀尚達數百萬兩，思宗雖非甚暗，到底捨不得拿出私房，錢之一關，其難渡如是。其次則作官的只要不謀反，弄幾個錢究竟算不了大事，蕭何以求田問舍免於刑戳，其故蓋可深長思。這個因素很複雜，不想在此詳說。只有李自成不客氣，把銀子化成汁灌給大官們吃，「生時恨其少，此時恨其多」，雖則殘忍，却也應該。周田等貴戚，魏藻德之類的近臣，不是如此，錢是永遠榨不出的。　　唐代自安史亂後，中央經濟繼崩潰，於是皇帝不能不向人民亂要錢，這種飲酖止渴的情形，也是數見不鮮的，最怪的就是有理性動物的人類而記憶竟如此之壞。司馬光給皇帝編了敎科書，謂之「資治通鑑」，恐怕也沒什麼用，北宋不過一百年就被專玩花石綱念經打醮的徽宗給送掉了。趙甌北念二史剳記唐代「間架除陌宮市五坊小使之病民」條云：「德宗……因用兵河南北，月費百餘萬　，聽盧杞趙贊等計，令商賈本錢過千萬者，貸其餘以濟軍，軍罷，取償於官。乃令京兆暴責大搜，疑占列（即自己報告）不盡，則笞掠之，人自經者相望。然僅得八十萬……於是設間架除陌之令，屋二架爲間，上者二千，中千，下五百，吏執籌入室計之，隱不盡者，二架即抵罪。告者以錢五萬賞之。……及涇師亂，呼於市曰：不奪爾商人僦質矣（一時質庫四貸其一，充軍費），不稅爾間架除陌矣！於是帝奔奉天，長安失守。」（涇師，即朱泚之亂）　　這敎訓還不够嗎？詎知不然！請再看下去：「李晨收京，始歸宮闕，是亦可稍鑒前率，以求民換，乃又用裴延齡李實等，橫征百出，……又聰宦官主宮市，置數十百人閱物　左，謂之白望。……大率與直，十不償一。……鵝民賣一　薪，宦人以數尺帛易之，又取他費，且驅　入官，民願納薪辭帛而去，不許，……諫臣交章論，皆不納。……不特此也，又聽宦官縱五坊小使，肆毒於外，每歲秋，案鷹犬於幾甸，所至逖索供饋，小不如意，至張羅網於民家門及井，不令出入汲井水，曰驚我供奉烏雀。又羣聚於酒家食肆，飲啖將去，留蛇一篋，誡之曰：吾以此蛇供烏雀，可善飼之，無使飢渴！主人重賂之，乃肯攙蛇云。　縣令崔發聞門外喧門聲，史白五坊小吏擊百姓，發命吏捕之，時已曛黑，天子聞之，怒，收發擊獄，御樓之日，囚發雞竿下，鵝內官五十餘人，持杖毆發，破面折齒，詔囚皆釋，而發不放。」　　這些部采自唐書烈傳，當然不是造識。白氏樂府「買炭翁」於此又得一證。　　或云，作史論可以使人胡說。我眞有點躭心自己的妄言。機遇  定中　　在我國，一個人的窮通得失，富貴壽夭，常被視爲是命裹註定的。所以不論投機者的暴發，枉法者的驕縱，以至平白地續遭掠奪，在　　之民的眼中，都認係命運使然，正無所用其欣美或怨尤的。這種「宿命」的論調，不單是小民中如此，即在所謂明識之士，與夫大人先生們眼中，亦莫不如此，不日某人　會來了，即日　往等　會，不過，據說這　　會是可「遇」而不可「求」的，因之美其名曰「機遇」。雖鵝時亦不免鵝對這種「守株待兔」式的「機遇」發生不耐，但是至多也不過表現於「富燒得，窮算命」罷了。　　但是相反的說法不是沒有。事情本來是鵝二面的，因此雖說「時勢造英雄」，又說「英雄造時勢」；叱咤購雲，煊赫一時，又豈是偶致的。「機遇」二字正也難說得很，恐怕在「遇」之前，早做過「求」的工夫了。　較切實的說法，我看倒還得推「禍福無門，惟人自召」的二句。這倒不是「宿命」論，可說是「現命」論，因爲這命是一個人在「現世」自造的。這難然有點「唯心」的意味，却也不遠乎「唯物」的。不見汪逆之所以爲汪逆，還不是因爲他自作自召的？倘眞的在「引刀成一快」的進候斷頭死云，那倒便宜了他，居然烈士了！所以，坐等「機遇」之降臨固然沒出息，誤解「機遇」而千方百計以尋求之，亦適足以誤人兼以自誤。天下事旣本來相對，那就得能活用，易云天定勝人，却又云人定勝天，那眞是誠而明之，存乎其人了。逍遙花  陳慎言第三章台上與台下（三〕　　卿道：「你這樣怎好出去」？鳳笙笑道：「沒關保，我新買一頂帽子，把他蓋上，誰注意牙：我們是云看戲，又不是去應酬有什麼關係」？雲卿見她如此說着，只暗自好笑。大家用過飯後，又開談一會，到了八點多鏟，渚齋催着各人快去，鳳鳳笙果把新買的絨帽往頭上一蓋，只因頭上裹著好幾層繃布，帽子小戴不下去，鳳笙沒奈何，只好把　布解下，用帽子蓋上，身上只穿一件布棉袍」。卿著她出去一點不打扮，說道：「晚上回來冷，你多穿點衣服吧」。鳳笙道：「我這一件棉袍，抵得你一件呢大衣」。渚齋看不過，說道：「你也換上一件乾淨衣服出去」。鳳笙道：「我們是去看戲，並不是打扮給別人看的，我才不穿呢」：渚齊只暗嘆了一口氣，不便再說，和大家到開明戲院，找到座位，仍在第三排。再看小王媽和綺統的小妹妹秀菊，早坐在那裹，中問空着三個坐位，留給渚齋三人坐的，渚齋一看布下這種羅網，暗暗呌苦，又不便和小王媽招呼。小不媽却背着臉，偸偸對渚齋一笑，渚齋只裝不認得，正要讓鳳笙和雲卿，靠秀菊這旁坐下，偏是鳳笙不聰話，見有空坐位，便一屁股坐下，恰和小王媽，挨着一槐，小王媽一雙眼睛，不住向鳳笙身上注視，由頭至脚看個遍，雲卿夾坐在中間，渚齋坐旁秀菊這一旁。那秀菊只對渚齊徵徵笑著，似要說話，見渚齊不理她，她也不敢說，坐了好一會，卻跑過云，要和小五媽調換坐位，小媽笑著走過來，渚　看了，更是著慌，仰著頭，只看在台上，不敢看她。小王媽却也知趣，只在脚下，用鞋尖在渚齊腿上，踢了兩下，低低說道：「老板在後合」。渚齋恐怕雲卿聽見，仍仰着頭，裝作不理會，禁不起小王媽连在他小腿上踢了幾腿，又用手臂肘他，意思催他快去。渚齋立起來對雲卿道：「我出去一會就來」。鳳笙聽見，却大聲說道：「你帶點花生瓜子和糖果來，這樣乾坐着沒意思」。渚齋縐一縐眉頭，轉身出去，走到後台，見着綺紈，綺紈還沒化裝，問渚齋過：「你的太太來了嗎「？渚齋點點頭。綺紈笑道：「難得！難得！眞給我捧塲」。二人說了幾句話，渚齋見綺紈快要上裝，退了出來，在戲院門口，隨意買些瓜子花生進去。鳳笙議着雲卿嚼着花生米，一面自己磕瓜子，大談起家務和日常生活。說來說去，總是每月家裹吃多少米，每斤米多少錢，每月煤球燒多少斤，魚肉都貴了，銀行裏又沒配給，衹拿薪水，渚齋開銷又大，滔滔說個不絕，說話聲音特別高，引得左右前後看戲的人，一個個都向她看了一兩眼，不勝厭惡。雲卿起初還和她敷衍，後來見她老說不完，便輕輕說道：「看戲罷」。鳳笙熬了一會，很不耐煩，又絮絮問雲卿在家幹什麼，老太太什麼時候回來？雲卿有時答他一兩句，有時祗裝做沒聽見。死刑的存廢  靖文　　最近英國政府爲討論廢止刑法上的紋刑問題，引起了學者間的一塲辯論。有一部人士主張不僅絞刑應該廢止，就是死刑的本身亦應加以廢止。他們的論據並非根據單純的人道主義，而是以爲無論怎樣的惡人，祇要置之優良的環境中，亦能悛悔而成爲好人。這和我國先聖的性本善論的主張恰好一致。　　可是，今年已達九十一歲高齡的劇作家薰伯納却不同意這種主張，他在寫給倫敦泰晤士報的一封信中說：「文明國家爲自衛對怙惡不悛者處以死刑的權利與權力，是永遠不能加以廢除的。我們對於一個拋擲銷鏹水的惡徒，應該像對付一條毒蛇或疫狗一樣的加以消減。對於一個爲了金錢去攪女人，然後加以遺棄的人，亦應視之爲社會的芟草而加以剷除……但能够敎誨的罪犯，當然不在此限；能敎誨的，應加敎誨。」　　關於應否廢止死刑一事，自古以來，就成爲哲學家和犯罪學者的所討論的問題，舊約上的摩西立法，是主張殺人者償命的。就是柏拉圖，亦曾說過無可港救的惡人，祇有置之於死地的話。至近世如孟德斯鳩，羅來，都認爲犯罪是社會的毒害，應予處死。不過早在十八世紀，也有人主張過應廢止死刑，如裴卡利亞的「關於犯罪與刑罰」一文中，即主張社會旣無能創造人的生，命也就無權奪取人的生命。　　一個理想的社會，自然最好是沒有人殺人的現象，因爲人的生命在種旅上雖可延續，而個人的生命却一個人祇有一次。上蒼旣鵝好生之德，則人與人間　書生命的事，自宜引以為戒。　　可是人間除了個別的人之外，更有一個人間社會的存在。個人旣不能離開社會而生存，則為了離衛社會羣的福利起見，就不能不鵝許多措置。這就產生了法律這東西。而不幸的是人類的性格至今蕕甚脆弱，每因環境或感淸的驅使，演出許多悲劇。　　死刑的設置，即是防衛國家與社會科益的一種最後手段。這種手段究竟有幾許效力，雖然是一個疑問，因近世犯罪事件並不因死刑的存在而見减少，且反增多。然而這個問題並不能從死刑的存廢上求得解決，而是一個普遍的社會問題。　　就現實條件言：死刑能否約制犯罪是另一個問題，但在社會條件如今日，則其暫時尚無法廢止，也是不可否認的事實。如前所述，死刑的設置旣是防衛社會的一種手段，亦叭鵝社會能健全到不用這種殘忍的手段亦能安全存在之日，死刑的存廢間題始能自獲解解決。　　死刑的普遍廢止，雖暫無可能，但却也不必過份重視死刑的儆戒力。像梟首示眾，游街示眾等等玩意兒，其養成羣眾殘忍性的影響，實遠過於儆戒。在過去講究殺頭的時代，據說就曾有人會在法塲上用饅頭蘸着死者的血喫，說是能壯胆。現在逢到公開槍斃人犯，也依舊有許多人爬牆攀壁的拍手呌好。如果這呌做大快人心，還不如說是有害人性爲確切吧。家人語錄  則仕　　今晨閱報，見有鞋店徴聘人才廣告，職位爲門市部職員，資歷大學畢業，年齡二十五至三十五歲，待遇見習期內每月津貼三百萬元並供膳宿。舍弟年方三十，畢業於本市著名某大學，現正失業在家。我就勸他應徴，不料為舍弟婦反對，她說；「大學畢了業去做鞋子店夥計，給阿狗阿貓女入小孩試穿鞋子，羞也要羞死了。」　　我說：羞死誰？　　她說：第一羞死我。我當初非大學畢業生不嫁。所以家父要把我許給一個鞋店小主人時我絕食反對，弄得幾乎父女斷絕關係。現在大學畢業的丈夫倒去做鞋店的夥計了，不把我羞死？　　我說：這是你的勢利之見。　　她說：我才不是勢利。要勢利我就去嫁鞋店主人了，鞋店可僱大學畢業生做夥計，講勢利不嫁老板倒嫁夥計？　　我說：那應大學畢業生爲什麼不宜做鞋店夥計呢？　　她說：那麼賣賣鞋子何必要大學畢業生呢？你去看看鞋子店那個門市部職員須要物理化學算術數理英文法文經史子集？　　我說：書是讀給自己用的，做個鞋店職員懂點英文法文觀點經史子集有何不好？　　她說：這話原也不錯，譬如我自己讀了三年西洋文學，蒙丹喬叟，密爾頓莎士比亞研究有素，正無妨於今日的給小寶洗尿布。但這是我自己願意的，要是我們給小寶找奶娘而限定要大學西洋文學系畢業女生，豈不是笑話？　　我說：那麼也不渦笑話而已，有什麼可羞？　　她說：就算本人不羞，總也是國家之羞．　　我說：何以故？　　她說：中國大學畢業生已經少得可憐，還找不到一個用其所學爲國家復興建設努力的機會，却去做鞋店夥計，豈不可羞。　　我說：也許正是國家之榮呢。因爲我國人之年在二十五至三十五歲者，已經個個大學畢業，故各業均用大學畢業生了。　　她說：你又要講笑話了。　　至此舍弟擇言：你們不必爭了，爲學有所用，我速鞋店老板也不屈就，如生活迫人，呌化子我也只得去做，好在業已早畢，損失已經損失。現在，大哥，龍姪已經初中一下了，你有可於老弟之大學畢業多年將去做鞋店職員，是否打算培植他到大學畢業了呢？　　我正欲回答，內人立即發言：「阿龍讀到年底決定呌他輟學。常初老太爺培植二弟從小學讀完大學，少說說也花上好幾條條子，現在學費更高，我要有錢培植阿龍到大學畢業，不會趁早把所有學費給他囤好貨物，讓他大起來開店做個老板，或者變現錢吃吃拆息，不是比到鞋店——」　　我說：「讀書究不是一定爲了賺錢呀。」　　妯娌二人齊聲；「雖道國家設大學倒是爲的給鞋子店造就　員？」　　我和舍弟同說：「你們女人家……」於是無結果而散。繍像　廢評話聖地的衛道者  白蕪文　龍生畫　　今年以前擊開重慶的朋友們，也許對這破爛的中世紀型的山域鵝一點懷聯吧，為了你會把寶貴的生命消遣了幾分之幾於此「抗戰聖地」。告訴您，今天重慶更富有紀念色彩了，通遠門下石巖的修長溜淍——「和平隧道」，精神堡壨巍然數十丈的高塔——「紀功碑」都已次第完成，敎塲口也在計　為輻射中心的花園，即將動工。　　陪都將爲千秋萬世的人憑弔，隨喜，仰止，瞻禮的聖地。　　可惜的是，自天，鶉衣菜色的乞丐，黑夜，濃脂厚粉的雉妓，徘徊在紀門碑與和平隧道，較塲口的，越發一天天多了。　　爲了不忍見下一代幼苗輾轉溝　，不久以前，曾經集中丐童送入兒童敎養院，和慈善團體，眞是竊然仁者之懷。却有煞風景自甘墮落的幼小者於集中時，蹤身跳下幾十丈高岩，肝腦塗地以報。據他同伴說：他便是敎養院逃出命來的孑遺，噍類。　　這是過去有根據的，南岸覺林寺的見童敎養院，經參議員調查的結果，平均每月俄死數十人，每日數人，死了便拖出去淺埋在山坡上，當夜便爲野犬爭食，院後坡前，白骨纍纍，像到了古戰塲！　　重慶是遠在節約政策實行以前，全國最早禁舞的都市，爲天下倡，先天下之憂而憂，維持風化的街道精神，值得大書一筆。　　不幸的是，這些失業舞女却並不會哭泣請願，默默地轉入地下，改爲「伴浴」，了。　　重慶是全國男女共浴制的三大都市之一，烟台，天津之外，只有重慶才有還秘多「家庭浴室」，好像因爲重　設有公娼，故乃網開一面，這是　上海也沒有的一種奇怪商業。然而，警察也並非不干沙取締，查到同浴的男女，往往無法鑑定是冶遊還是夫婦，便用隔離偵訊法，個別盤問。　　可是饑傾會使人聰明，伴舞改業伴浴的有些女人，已想到一個辦法，那就是在所携皮夾裏，準備兩張結婚證書，遇到查者，便坦然取出，其勢不贈傳證婚人到塲，也就無法辨其眞僞。　　偽善與人道之間祇隔一張紙。社會服務上海直接稅局解釋　送貨單貼印花辦法　如有持證耍挾請檢舉法辦　　財政部上海直接稅局函云：案准貴科函轉讓者李愼之君請求公開解釋；某工廠大股東開設商號，而以該廠發行所名義銷售該廠暨其他工廠出品，所用送貨單等素不貼用印花稅粟，近被某機關認爲有逃稅嫌疑，持證要挾，請對上項情節之送貨單是否須要貼花。惠予解答見覆等由。查承銷工廠出品之商號，對外另具牌號，自非工廠內部組織，其往來單據不得視爲內部憑證，廠方送貨所開出之送貨條，記載品名數量，核具發貨票性質，應按印花稅法第十六條第一目規定，每件按貨價每千元貼印花稅票三元；如未　明金額者，應按同法第十五條後段規定，就原列品名數量，依法價或市價估計應貼印花稅票。又收款時另具轉賬憑單，代替收款收據者，其所載金額與原送貨條相同，將該項收據粘附送貨條後者，免貼印花；如金額不同時，應按較高數額貼足印花稅票。至所稱某機關持證要挾一節，如係屬實，可由受害人直接向本局檢舉法辦。准函前由，相應復請查照爲荷！此致申報社會服務科。電信問答上海電信局至答　　（徐家雖父通大學吳同問）鄙人擬將少量無錢電零件寄往重慶，按章經得貴局核許，方能郵寄，敬懇賜告此項手續應如何辦理？應至何處申請？（答）按無錢電材料轉口憑證辦法第二條及第三條之規定「凡欲在國內各地間轉運無綫電材料者，應依式塡具申請書並開具料單三份，向交通部或就近向電信局領得轉口憑證後，方准起遝……」「轉口之材料屬於發射用品者，領證時除依前條之規定辦理外，並應詳敘用途，經報請交通部或電信局轉呈交通部核准後方得起運」。該項請領無錢電材料轉口憑證辦法，無綫電材轉射口憑證申請書及無綫電發射器材一覽表均得向四川北路一七六一號本局工程師室免　索取。兩路員工捐　款接濟戴夫人本報已代爲郵匯轉致　　京滬區鐵路特別黨部函云：逕啓者，頃接本路員工慰勞國軍運動委員會函，以閱貴報十二月八日第一張第二版刊載專電，戴安瀾夫人困滯衡陽消息，情况悲慘，備極同情，送來　幣一百萬元，囑爲轉請貴報代爲匯轉等由，用特備函連同國幣一百萬元，一併請祈警收，代轉并掣給收據爲荷。此致申報館。（附國幣一百萬元）　　〔編者按〕承囑匯轉自當照辦。已備函由郵匯交衡陽本報通信員轉交戴夫人具領矣。</p>

<h3>Yesterday Morning's State Council Meeting Passed the "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage," Extending the Dates for Various Agencies and Councilors to Exercise Their Powers, with the National Assembly Session Still Pending a Formal Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The State Council convened a meeting on the morning of the 12th, presided over in person by Chairman Chiang. In addition to reports from Wang Shijie on foreign affairs and Qin Dechun on military affairs, three important proposals were discussed: The draft "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage," also known as the handover measures, was approved and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, to be promulgated and implemented on December 25th. The draft "Special Construction Donation Regulations" was extensively discussed and then referred to the Economic Commission for review. The terms of the current National Councilors were extended until the date of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The long-debated issue of whether the National Assembly would be held as scheduled or postponed was definitively decided at the State Council meeting on the morning of the 12th. Provisions were also made regarding the exercise of powers by administrative organs after the implementation of the Constitution but before the National Assembly is held. The details of the proposal (Note: This proposal was submitted by the Chairman for discussion) are as follows: The proposal is the draft "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage." The resolution is: December 25th of this year will be the date of constitutional implementation. However, it is not yet possible to convene the National Assembly immediately. Since the Provisional Constitution has become invalid, the various organs exercising political power cannot be interrupted, nor can they lack a legal basis. Therefore, transitional measures are being drafted to bridge the gap, to be promulgated simultaneously with a formal order for the convening of the National Assembly on a fixed date, after the completion of the legislative process on December 25th. It is now deeply understood that the contents of these measures are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>A. The original legal powers and functions of the National Government will continue to be exercised until the President and Vice President are elected, at which point they will cease.</p>
<p>B. The Executive Yuan will cease to exercise its powers once the President appoints a new Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>C. The Legislative Yuan will cease once a new Legislative Yuan is established. D. The original powers of the Judicial and Examination Yuans will cease once the new Constitution is in effect.</p>
<p>E. The Control Yuan will cease once a newly elected Control Yuan is established.</p>
<p>F. Various local governments and public opinion organs will cease after the new Constitution is implemented. G. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Regarding the issue of the termination date of the National Political Council, Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the council submitted it to the State Council, which was presented for discussion and passed on the morning of the 12th. The original plan was for the National Political Council to end on December 24th of this year, but since the National Assembly has no fixed date, the council, as a public opinion institution, should be extended until the date of the establishment of the local Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Special Construction Donation Collection: Guiding by Persuasion as a Principle, Chairman Instructs to Strive for Simplification to Avoid Harassment</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The issue of collecting a special construction donation aroused heated debate in the State Council meeting on the 12th. After Finance Minister Yu Hongjun explained, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Xu Fulin, and others all expressed opposition, believing that the regulations were too restrictive and harsh, like regulations for punishing bandits. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang stood up and instructed that efforts should be made to simplify them to avoid harassment, and to guide by persuasion as a principle. It was decided to submit the proposal to the Government Commission's Economic Commission for review.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] After being passed by the Executive Yuan meeting, the "Special Construction Donation Regulations" were discussed at the State Council meeting on the 12th. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun first gave a detailed explanation, stating that the regulations were drafted based on the principle that during the construction period, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. The donated wealth and goods will be based on the amount of wealth of compatriots throughout the country, and it is only a one-time donation. It is hoped that compatriots throughout the country will support this in order to complete the arduous task of construction. When Zou Lu, Zhang Ji, and Xu Fulin spoke, they all expressed dissenting opinions. Mr. Xu even said: This matter has a "deceptive" air. The regulations stipulate that people's property, whether it is immovable property such as houses, valuable jewelry of wives and children, or movable property such as domestic and foreign bank deposits, securities, and company stocks, must be declared voluntarily. The items are numerous and complicated, making it difficult to handle. Moreover, it is even more problematic for individuals to declare voluntarily. Although there are regulations to punish those who report secretly or fail to report after the deadline, it will be difficult to implement. Finally, Chairman Chiang also expressed his opinion on these regulations.

<h3>Exporting Surplus Materials: First Batch of Contracts Signed, Aiming to Earn Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] In order to accelerate the processing of surplus materials and scrap iron remaining on various islands in the Pacific, the Central China authorities recently instructed the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan to hand over unusable materials and scrap iron remaining on Lake Island, Saipan, Mariana and other 13 islands to the Central Bank, so as to re-negotiate foreign sales in order to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The first batch of scrap iron for export was officially signed at the Central Bank on the afternoon of the 11th. This batch of scrap iron includes ships, jeeps, tanks, etc. that have already been scrapped. The tonnage and value of this batch of scrap iron have not yet been estimated, but the right to purchase this scrap iron has been obtained by the Tongyuan Trading Company, which signed the contract, and will be resold to the Bethlehem Iron Company of the United States.</p>
<p>This batch of scrap iron will be transported by the American Steamship Company. However, due to the large quantity, it is estimated that it can fill 100 ships. If it is shipped back and forth continuously, it will take 18 months to transport it from various islands to the east coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the batch of scrap iron weighs a total of 150,000 tons, including useful materials such as road construction machinery, and that the total value is US$30 million. Those responsible for signing the contract were unable to confirm this. However, they asserted that the batch of materials was indeed scrap iron that could no longer be used. As for the tonnage value, it can only be determined after an on-site inspection. It is reported that the Central Bank has sent personnel to various islands to investigate.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of the surplus materials remaining on the Pacific islands are debts owed to our country by the United States during the war, which were transferred to our country. The U.S. government believes that our country has the right to resell a portion of these materials, and the U.S. has no right to interfere.</p>

<h3>The Shaanxi Luo Hui Canal Releases Water: 500,000 Acres of Fields Rely on It for Nourishment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency reporter Xiao Tongxin, Dali, 12th] The Shaanxi Luo Hui Canal project, planned by the late Mr. Li Yizhi, has been completed after 13 years of hard work by the water conservancy organs, and a water release ceremony was held in Yijing Village, which belongs to Dali County. Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Sun, President Zhang, and the central leaders all presented inscriptions. The ceremony began at 12:30 pm. This remote small village was filled with officials and dignitaries, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. The nearby farmers were overjoyed and ran to tell each other, helping the old and carrying the young, all came to watch the ceremony. Water Conservancy Minister Xue Dubi opened the gate to release water, and Mrs. Chairman cut the ribbon. The flood of the Luo River broke out of the long Tie Lian Mountain Tunnel in this grand ceremony and rushed into the new canal. From then on, the people of Chaoyi, Dali, and Pucheng counties will no longer worry about drought, and 500,000 acres of fields will be nourished by it. According to those who are familiar with agricultural affairs, it is said that in the future, the annual output can be increased by 100,000 city stones of wheat, 75,000 city stones of beans and miscellaneous grains, and 7.5 million city catties of cotton, with a total value of approximately 152.5 billion national currency. The land itself can also increase in value by 225 billion yuan, and the annual water fee can be 6 billion yuan. The Luo Hui Canal is not the largest among the eight canals in Guanzhong, but in terms of time and scale, it is second to none among all water conservancy projects in the country. This canal was opened during the Han Dynasty, and it took 13 years, but it was not successful. History records that the Longshou Canal is this one. After 33 years of the Republic of China, it was actively built by water conservancy organs before it was completed. The total project cost reached more than 6.5 billion yuan. The total branch canal is 97,860 kilometers long, and the fifth tunnel is 3,377 meters long. The working conditions of gushing springs and quicksand were extremely difficult and dangerous. It is not easy to see its completion today. Advisor Zhao Shouyu said in his speech: Human power can overcome nature, and today's people can overcome the ancients. We should take care of ourselves in the future to ensure eternal completeness. After the ceremony, we went to the construction site to visit the arduous project, and returned to Yijing at 5:00 pm, where a meeting was held to commemorate the martyred employees.

<h3>US House Passes Foreign Aid Bill; Final Decision to Be Made by Joint Congressional Committee; Special Aid Plan for China May Be Drafted Separately</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, December 11] The US House of Representatives today passed the transitional aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria by voice vote.</p>
<p>The bill passed by the House will now be submitted to a conference committee of both the House and Senate for discussion in order to reconcile the differences between the two chambers and reach an agreement. According to the aid bill passed by the House, a total of $590,000,000 will be allocated, including for China, France, Italy, and Austria. However, the Senate's $597,000,000 aid bill only includes France, Italy, and Austria, excluding China. According to US regulations, whenever the two chambers find two different bills on the same issue, a committee should be established by both chambers, with each chamber having half the members, to discuss compromise methods.</p>
<p>The House bill will stipulate that the Export-Import Bank immediately advance $150,000,000 without waiting for further regulations to allocate the already-passed amount.</p>

<h3>Truman to Ask Congress to Allocate $300 Million in Aid to China First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, December 11] According to the Washington office of Cowles Communications: Truman will ask Congress next month to allocate $300 million to aid China. At that time, a Marshall Plan for China, similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe, will appear. The State Department's China policy is currently in a state of hibernation to avoid overwhelming Congress with too many foreign aid plans at the same time. The US aid to China plan will first allocate $300 million to make up for China's trade deficit (note: the current monthly deficit is about $20 million). The next step will include military aid, which will transfer the US's remaining materials in the Far East to China, and hire American experts to train Chinese troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 11] President Truman announced today that the message regarding the Marshall Plan for Europe will not be submitted to Congress until next week. He will also not personally present this message to Congress. It is generally believed that the President will wait until after signing the temporary aid bill before submitting the Marshall Plan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Opening of the Pǔjì Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>Following the opening of the Jinhua-Geyang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the restoration of traffic on the Hengyang-Liuzhou section of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, the Pǔjì section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has also been repaired. It was successfully reopened for the first time on the 11th and a meeting was held yesterday to commemorate it. People in Jinan and Shandong Province, and even the entire North China region, have expressed their joy at this. Indeed, we cannot ignore the restoration of this section of railway transportation. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is a railway trunk line that runs north-south, connecting four provinces, and is a major artery extending 1,009 kilometers. Since the victory, it has been destroyed by the communist bandits and its traffic has been interrupted for as long as 25 months. This spring, the national army in Shandong Province advanced rapidly, and various places in southern Shandong were successively recovered. The emergency repair work started at any time, and after experiencing difficulties, the Jinan-Pukou section was completely repaired and officially opened to traffic. We cannot but first express our admiration to the railway authorities for their tireless efforts and hard work in emergency repairs. This emergency repair project was not easy: under the difficult conditions of scarce materials and funds, and with the added situation of the situation along the line not yet fully restored to peace, in this situation, working hard to repair the railway, and finally being able to restore the traffic between Jinan and Pukou in a short period of time, we cannot help but first express our highest admiration to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway authorities.</p>
<p>The restoration of railway traffic between Jinan and Pukou is still a considerable distance away from the obvious restoration of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line. Although the opening of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line still awaits a future date, we believe that there are several points that should be brought to the attention of the Chinese people due to the opening of the Pǔjì section: The opening of the Pǔjì section is a remarkable achievement. This opening shows that regardless of the destruction by the communist bandits, the government is constantly working hard to revive the economy. The government's efforts to revive and the communist bandits' destruction are in stark contrast. The Chinese people should have a new awakening about this: The opening of the Pǔjì section strengthens the relationship between North China provinces and cities such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan and the central government, which has the effect of strengthening centripetal force. We hope that people in North China will see the opening of the Pǔjì section and be able to express their loyalty to the central government even more; Due to the opening of the Pǔjì section, materials between the north and the south can flow smoothly. On the day of the opening, there were two coal trains that transported coal produced in Shandong to Beijing and Shanghai, which will obviously have a direct effect on relieving the coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, other materials may also achieve the practical effect of smooth flow due to the opening of the Pǔjì section. This is of course closely related to the recovery of my country's national economy.</p>
<p>Due to the opening of the Pǔjì section, we hope that the entire Tianjin-Pukou line can also restore traffic in the near future. The Pǔjì section already accounts for two-thirds of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line, so the restoration of the other one-third of the traffic may be easier. However, the factors in the restoration of railway traffic are not entirely controlled by the railway authorities. How to restore the north-south trunk line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also depends on the cooperation of other military and political authorities and the general public. We hope that through the cooperation of the military and the people, the traffic on this north-south trunk line can be restored as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>Another Measure to Suppress Prices: Rationing</h3>
<p>Following the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, various emergency measures, such as strengthening financial controls, improving the management of cotton yarn and cloth, restricting remittances, suspending lending, tightening credit, restricting cash withdrawals, strictly investigating hoarding, cracking down on price gouging, and selling off materials, are all being carried out or intensified. However, the promotion of rationing, although stipulated in the Economic Suppression of Disturbances Measures, and considered by the authorities to be an important measure to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, has not seen any action until recently. The reason for this is very obvious: to truly implement rationing, it is necessary to grasp all the materials, obtain accurate and reliable statistics, organize it on a national scale, and establish effective general and branch agencies before it can be effective.</p>
<p>The reasons for implementing rationing are nothing more than two points: A shortage of materials requires the total amount of all materials prepared for rationing nationwide to be planned as a whole and distributed fairly and reasonably. The emphasis is on the quantitative aspect, which is the so-called policy of equal poverty; Limiting ration prices and eradicating black markets to stabilize people's livelihood. The emphasis is on the price aspect, which is the so-called fair price policy. Therefore, if all the materials cannot be grasped, it is impossible to make an overall plan; only running it locally, without being able to run it from the national whole, there is no way to make an overall plan, without reliable national figures, there is even no way to make an overall plan; without a fully effective general and branch agency, no one can shoulder the responsibility of this overall plan.</p>
<p>The United States is negotiating with Congress to restore the former rationing plan. However, according to reports, the restoration work will not be completed in less than three months; this is because the scope is too large, and the preparation of materials, organizations, and figures is too complicated.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is also implementing comprehensive rationing. The food item alone requires nearly 400 million pounds to be subsidized from the national treasury every year. This is because in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, subsidies must be provided. It is also a country that relies on immediate food supplies, and the state has to find ways to import food to distribute. Otherwise, its lowest fixed amount cannot be maintained, the black market will inevitably be rampant, and may even endanger its rationing system itself.</p>
<p>Based on these examples above, we can know that: Simply implementing local rationing cannot grasp all the materials, and can definitely not eliminate the black market or stabilize prices; Within the same region, only implementing partial rationing, ignoring the rest, cannot grasp all the materials, which means that it is fundamentally impossible to eliminate the black market or stabilize prices; If the rationed amount of the part being rationed is too low to maintain its minimum needs, or if its period is too inaccurate to supply its regularly necessary consumption, it is tantamount to encouraging the black market and creating a black market; Whether it is comprehensive rationing or local rationing, if its ration price must be adjusted according to the cost, without preparing to subsidize it, then the original intention of stabilizing prices cannot be realized; When materials are too scarce, it is not enough to start with dredging sources, but only to limit the existing materials that can be obtained in front of you, it is definitely not enough to maintain its fixed amount and fixed period; If the objects being rationed and the agencies handling it are too simple and crude, it will inevitably weaken the effect of its rationing.</p>
<p>Currently, the only rationing being implemented, apart from the in-kind rationing for civil servants and teachers, is limited to Shanghai, and only to a certain part of Shanghai. Although the people handling it have made their best efforts, the various conditions mentioned above have not been fully met; its greatest achievement can only be to provide special benefits to a certain group of people, that is, the people who get the ration can get a certain fair-priced item. If the amount of goods is not enough, they still have to seek it on the black market. All those who cannot enjoy this special benefit have to seek it on the black market, and of course there is no such thing as fair-priced goods in places where rationing is not implemented. The result is that not only is the surplus or deficit of materials unequal in various places, but even within the same region, there is a great difference; The rising tide of prices, the activity of speculation, and the instability of people's livelihood have never been thoroughly stopped. Still taking Shanghai as an example: rice is partially rationed, but the rice market is still crazy; sugar is universally rationed, but in addition to the ration price and negotiated price, the black market is still rampant. Other things such as coal briquettes, cooking oil, rayon, cotton yarn, etc., all have their different forms of sale or rationing, and all have their various black markets. This is not necessarily because the rationing is not effective, nor is it necessarily because the crackdown and investigation are not strict, but it is really because the plan is not thorough and there are too many loopholes.</p>
<p>But seeing the prevalence of rationing systems in various countries, and the re-emergence of the old tune in the United States, we can know that this system is indeed the most reasonable and effective way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. However, in our view, if you cut corners and do it piecemeal, it is definitely ineffective. Therefore, the promotion of the rationing system, which has been delayed in implementation, and has not seen actual implementation, does not need to be anxious or disappointed. It is said that the central government, in order to implement rationing, had the idea of hiring British experts. Yesterday's Central News Agency news said that Mr. Hurt, Assistant Secretary of the British Ministry of Food, will come to China as a consultant for the Ministry of Food. It can be seen that in the future, the central government may take further steps and adopt a meticulous and systematic method in handling rationing, in order to achieve the purpose of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. We have seen that there are now many hasty and random medical treatments, which are causing chaos in the economic world to sink deeper and deeper. We cannot help but place deep expectations on this fundamental improvement preparation work.</p>

<h3>Japanese Reparations Machine Tools Awaiting Transport</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Important decisions of the Reparations Committee are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Passed the plan for receiving and transporting Japanese reparations materials. The main points are to determine the receiving agencies and the work that each agency should prepare: The ship loading and transportation work on the Japanese port side will be handled by the Receiving Committee of the Mission to Japan. On the Chinese port side: A. The ministries and commissions receiving the materials will set up receiving agencies. B. The Transportation Office for Reparations Materials of the Ministry of Communications will establish an office. C. It is stipulated that each port will hold a joint conference for receiving and transporting reparations materials, with the participation of the heads of the above-mentioned agencies, and presided over by the representative of the Supervising and Transportation Committee stationed in the port.</p>
<p>2. Passed the exchange procedures for Japanese reparations materials in the port, so as to avoid temporary chaos.</p>
<p>3. Japanese reparations materials are transported to many ports in our country, but most of them are still transported to Shanghai as the final destination. The first batch of ships carrying reparations materials is also determined to arrive in Shanghai, so the preparatory work in Shanghai is particularly important. The preparations are as follows: All ministries and commissions have set up receiving agencies in Shanghai, which have been handled by the ministries and commissions. The Shanghai office of the Transportation Office for Japanese Reparations Materials of the Ministry of Communications is concurrently held by Mr. Hú Shíyuān, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The Shanghai Joint Transportation Conference will be convened every Wednesday by Mr. Hú Shíyuān, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who is hired by the Supervising and Transportation Committee of the Reparations Committee as the representative stationed in Shanghai. The heads of the receiving agencies of various departments in Shanghai will hold liaison meetings. The preparatory work of various ministries and commissions in Shanghai has been basically completed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has pre-scheduled two ships, "Hǎikāng" and "Hǎizhè," to go to Japan to receive and transport the materials, and the Reparations Committee has telegraphed the situation of the two ships to the Mission to Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on entry procedures in the vicinity. As soon as the telegram granting entry arrives, they can immediately sail to Japan. The import of reparations materials has been approved by the Executive Yuan to issue a general license and exempt them from taxes. All the procedures to be handled have also been negotiated separately. According to the above-mentioned preparations, if the crating work proceeds quickly, the first batch of 9,449 machine tools can be transported within two months. The first batch of ships to transport Japanese reparations materials can arrive in Shanghai within this month.</p>
<h3>Personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" in Shanghai Flew to Tianjin Yesterday and Transferred to Communist Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In addition to the sudden disappearance of Director Lín Zhòng, the other five personnel of the Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China's "Liberation Headquarters" who were withdrawing as agreed, took a Civil Air Transport plane to Tianjin yesterday morning and transferred back to the Communist area.</p>
<p>Regarding Lín Zhòng's actions, the Civil Air Transport issued a statement yesterday, stating that it would no longer be responsible for his safety, saying, "According to the agreement, after the closure of the 'Liberation Headquarters' office, all personnel of the office should be escorted safely back to the Communist area. However, Representative Lín suddenly went elsewhere on his own, and sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration before leaving, saying that he would go directly to Hong Kong, which is obviously a violation of the agreement. The responsibility of this office for the safety of Mr. Lín's actions no longer exists due to his breach of contract."</p>
<p>In addition, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration told reporters that Lín Zhòng did not fly to Tianjin and return to the Communist area together because he sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, claiming that he "voluntarily" did not go. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also not responsible for his future safety issues. As for the seven staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the Communist area, according to the agreement between the two parties, they can also return south after the personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" withdraw. This agreement should not be affected by Lín Zhòng's personal "voluntary" non-return. As for when these seven people will return to Shanghai, it should be decided by them, because they may be willing to withdraw after the work is completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, December 12] The five personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters," Jì Fēng and others, arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 12th and will be repatriated to the Communist area together with the personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" in Tianjin within days.</p>

<h3>Case of the Murder of Qí Xuéqǐ, Former Deputy Commander of the 38th Division</h3>
<p>Two Main Culprits to Be Executed Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, December 12] Qí Xuéqǐ, former Deputy Commander of the 38th Division of the New First Army stationed in India and Burma, was stabbed to death on July 9, 1945, in the Yangon concentration camp by Zhāng Jíxiáng, a driver, and ten others who were also detained in the same place. Relevant authorities informed our newspaper reporter today that the date has been set, and the two main culprits, Zhāng Jíxiáng and others, will be executed by firing squad on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that after Zhāng and others were captured, they were weak-willed and attempted to surrender. Because Qí firmly opposed it, Zhāng held a sharp knife in the middle of the night, ambushed beside the staircase on the second floor of the concentration camp, and assassinated Qí when he went upstairs. After the victory, Zhāng fled to Kunming and surrendered to the Yunnan Police Headquarters. The other nine people were arrested one after another. Zhāng was sentenced to ten years in prison. Later, the Military Affairs Commission returned the case for a retrial, and Zhāng was sentenced to death. The others were acquitted. Zhāng refused to accept the sentence and submitted a petition to the Ministry of National Defense, claiming that ten people committed the crime at the same time and the sentence was unfair, and falsely accused the Chief of Military Law Section and Judge of the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters of accepting bribes. The Ministry of National Defense considered the case to be complicated and ordered the Chongqing Executive Headquarters to conduct a trial in early September. Now that the truth has come out, a certain section chief and judge have also been declared innocent and released.</p>

<h3>Government Takes Various Measures, Commodity Prices Generally Decline in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] After the issuance of banknotes worth 10,000 yuan or more, there has been no significant fluctuation in commodity prices in Nanjing. This is due to the appropriate handling by the government in advance, such as the decision by the Joint Treasury to stop lending by national banks and vigorously tighten the currency supply. Although large banknotes have been issued, the money supply in the market remains tight. At the same time, the establishment of financial management bureaus in various important cities will strictly inspect commercial banks and money houses that engage in speculation and hoarding. Once discovered, they will be shut down and severely punished. Therefore, the aforementioned speculative banks and money houses do not dare to act rashly or easily take advantage. Moreover, the government has decided to establish a Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to control cotton yarn and cloth and implement the government's policies of entrusted spinning and weaving, unified purchasing and unified sales, to stabilize prices. The government also plans to implement a comprehensive rationing system for six daily necessities in the short term to stabilize the prices of daily necessities for the people. Therefore, commodity prices can be expected to achieve considerable stability in the near future.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Chengdu dispatch, 12th] The price fluctuations in Chengdu caused by the issuance of large banknotes have been strictly suppressed by the provincial and municipal governments, and prices have begun to decline on the 11th and 12th. On the 12th, cotton yarn, fabrics, general merchandise, cigarettes, and grain all fell by 10%, and the money supply has not loosened.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Hankou dispatch, 12th] Since the news of the issuance of large banknotes spread, the markets in the three towns (of Wuhan) were once chaotic. After the Municipal Police Department arrested 49 merchants who took the opportunity to raise prices, commodity prices have begun to decline today.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 12th] On the 11th, there was a rush to buy goods in the city of Taiyuan. Except for grain and flour, which remain tight, everything else is normal. The discount rate is 80 yuan per yuan within banks and 90 yuan outside banks. Although grain and flour have reached unprecedented high prices, there is no major impact on the lives of citizens because of the cooperative system of the common people's economy. Citizens can buy a two-day supply of white flour at a price of 5,400 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), and sorghum flour at a price of 2,400 yuan per jin. Those who have not joined the cooperative can also buy sorghum flour at a slightly higher price of 3,500 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 12th] The Beiping Municipal Police Department, under the order of the municipal government, mobilized criminal police officers to form a temporary economic inspection team. Today, they went to the city to conduct spot checks on various grain stores and grain depots, strictly monitoring their transactions, and inspecting the black market for gold and foreign currency, continuing to arrest many "gold devils" (currency speculators). The activities of unscrupulous merchants have been suppressed. Commodity prices are fluctuating, but grain prices remain firm. Today, the Joint Treasury's Beiping office held a meeting and decided to start lending 50 billion yuan in grain loans.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The money supply in Qingdao's market is even tighter today, and affected by the Shanghai market, the prices of various goods have generally fallen. 32-count Silver Moon yarn fell by 7 million yuan, Dasuanglong cloth fell by 50,000 yuan, and flour flooded the market, falling to 450,000 yuan per bag.

<p>[Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 12th] Yesterday, affected by the issuance of large banknotes, commodity prices in Hangzhou fluctuated, but have slightly recovered today. Only the price of rice is still rising. After the grain market opened yesterday, there was a fight due to supply exceeding demand, which was quelled by military police. Because of the impact of the two previous rice rushes, the common people are scrambling to buy rice. The price of white japonica rice on the market has reached 860,000 yuan, peaking at 900,000 yuan. The place of origin has reported a price drop today, and it is predicted that the Hangzhou market will stabilize tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Reach Preliminary Agreement; Agree to Increase German Steel Production Level; Deadline for Allied Control Council to Publish List of Dismantled Factory Equipment</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: According to Soviet sources, if the Foreign Ministers' Conference can immediately decide on the establishment of an overall economic and administrative organization for Germany, Mr. Molotov may agree to temporarily postpone the demand for $10 billion in reparations from Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, chaired by Mr. Marshall, was the most successful since the beginning of this session. The four foreign ministers have reached an agreement on the following three items: increasing Germany's steel production level to 11.5 million tons per year; revising Germany's industrial level; and the deadline for submitting the list of factories to be dismantled and shipped. In addition, the four foreign ministers agreed to discuss the Soviet proposal to establish a central economic organization for Germany. However, the issue of reparations was not discussed at today's meeting. Regarding the British proposal to dissolve German monopoly enterprises, the United States and France submitted amendments yesterday. After discussion today, a complete agreement was reached on the full text of the proposal. Regarding the first item, Mr. Bidault made concessions during the discussion, stating that France never intended to deprive the German people of their normal economic level. Their only concerns were security issues and the special status of the Ruhr. He would reserve these two points for future discussion. As a result, the four foreign ministers agreed to the amount proposed by Mr. Bevin. Regarding the issue of industrial levels, the UK proposed gradually restoring German industry, especially establishing a close link between coal exports and steel production. France suggested that the increase in German industrial activity should ensure that it does not take precedence over the recovery of European democratic countries. As a result, the UK, the US, and France all agreed to the principle of gradual recovery, while Mr. Molotov stated that he would reserve his position. During the discussion on the dismantling of German industrial equipment, France and the Soviet Union insisted that it should include the transfer of machine tools as reparations, while Mr. Bevin strongly opposed it. As a result, Mr. Marshall suggested that the drafting committee re-draft the proposal with reference to the positions of the UK and France. Regarding the dismantling issue, Mr. Bevin advocated not setting a deadline, while Mr. Molotov strongly advocated setting a deadline. As a result, it was agreed to limit the Allied Control Council to publish the final list of factory equipment to be dismantled by April 15, 1948. Regarding the elimination of Germany's essential military industries, it was resolved to hand this issue over to the drafting committee to draft a proposal.</p>
<h3>Rejecting Soviet Protests Again, France Sends Strong Note, Accusing Soviet Nationals of Inciting French Citizens to Flee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] The French government sent a strong note to the Soviet Union on the 11th, rejecting the Soviet protest against the French military's attack on a Soviet expatriate concentration camp near Paris on November 14. The note pointed out that the anti-Soviet activities of the people in the concentration camp, without the permission of the French government, were a low-level organization inciting escape.</p>
<p>The note pointed out that approximately 60 French men and women fled to the Soviet Union from there. After arriving in the Soviet Union, they requested France to send them back, and their departure to the Soviet Union was not voluntary. Soviet-French relations now seem to be continuing to deteriorate. Some officials expect that the Soviet Union may announce the abrogation of the Soviet-French Treaty of Mutual Assistance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] It is generally believed that there are between 20,000 and 30,000 French citizens awaiting repatriation in the Soviet Union, most of whom were captured with the German army. Officials said that the French embassy in the Soviet Union will continue to search for their whereabouts after the expulsion of the dispersal group. Soviet citizens and German prisoner-of-war camp officials have made it difficult to find French citizens.</p>
<h3>Mr. Maqui Dismissed for Arbitrarily Criticizing the Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] After Lieutenant Colonel Maqui, head of the French dispersal group in the Soviet Union, made remarks criticizing the French government's policies, a spokesman for the French Ministry of Veterans Affairs announced on the 12th that Maqui had been dismissed. The spokesman emphasized that although Maqui is a Communist and has been dismissed, the government may still punish him after he returns to Paris.</p>
<h3>Mr. Marshall's Speech Praises Close UK-US Relations</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: Today, the English Association of Teachers hosted a banquet to entertain Secretary of State Marshall. During the banquet, Mr. Marshall gave a speech, praising the "close relationship" between the UK and the US, believing that this relationship is beneficial to both countries, because what the UK and the US pursue are not narrow doctrines, but the creed of freedom. Mr. Marshall did not mention the Soviet Union, but his vigorous praise of UK-US relations sufficiently contrasted with the unsatisfactory relationship between the two major Western powers and the Soviet Union. However, Mr. Marshall indirectly refuted the Soviet Union's accusation that the UK and the US have ulterior motives.</p>
<h3>Armed Police Block Violent Acts; Rome Labor Strike Weakens; Expected to End Within Days</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 12th] Since the Italian Communist Party launched the general strike in Rome, it has been on the verge of failure on the 12th. The Communist Party was greatly anxious and launched violent groups to deal with various industries that were operating as usual. The violent groups moved around everywhere. At the same time, banks, stores, securities firms, and Catholic schools joined the anti-strike movement, and the number of people increased. Thousands of policemen drove quickly back and forth in the city to prevent the actions of violent groups.</p>
<p>The city's labor union, controlled by the Communist Party, was not very enthusiastic about negotiating with the government in the past. On the morning of the 12th, it announced that its representatives were willing to resume negotiations with Prime Minister De Gasperi. However, the executive committee of the labor union waited for a long time without a response. The Italian Communist labor leader, Vittorio, finally called Labor Minister Fanfani to discuss the matter. The two then held a meeting. People in the city's labor union predict that the strike will be canceled on the 12th or 13th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] Three regiments of the army entered Rome today to help the police maintain order during the general strike.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] Italian labor leader and Communist member Vittorio has ordered 500,000 workers in Rome to continue the strike on the 12th, and threatened a nationwide general strike to protest the government's rejection of labor demands. Prime Minister De Gasperi then took measures similar to those of France, gathering the army and navy, fully armed, and using box cannons, tear gas, and hand grenades to protect the "right to work."</p>
<h3>UK to Abandon Trusteeship of Holy Land Around Mid-May of Next Year; Declares Unwillingness to Participate in Implementing Partition</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons today that if negotiations between the UK and the United Nations proceed quickly, the UK may abandon its trusteeship of the Holy Land before May 15. The 70,000 British troops currently stationed in the Holy Land will also be withdrawn at an accelerated pace. According to the current timetable, British troops will be completely withdrawn before August 1 of next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Bevin said that British troops will not participate in assisting the partition of the Holy Land, and even if the United Nations asks the UK to participate in this matter, it is unwilling to accept this task. As for which country should be responsible for implementing this partition work, it must be decided by the Security Council. The United Nations may ask the US and the Soviet Union to send troops to implement the partition plan and prevent the urgent need for armed struggle between the Arab and Jewish ethnic groups.</p>

<h3>New UK-Soviet Trade Agreement to be Signed Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: Rumors that the UK may cancel bread rationing after the signing of the new UK-Soviet trade agreement have been denied by authoritative government sources, because the several categories of goods that the Soviet Union has agreed to supply to the UK do not include wheat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] After the UK-Soviet trade agreement is formally signed within a week to ten days, approximately one million tons of Soviet grain will be imported into the UK starting next year. Mr. Stansgate or London's statement last night did not involve exact figures, because the drafting work still requires a week to ten days before the signing. However, authoritative sources revealed that the amount of coarse grains supplied to the UK by the Soviet Union will exceed the total of 500,000 tons of all coarse grains imported by the UK from various countries last year. The shipping date is approximately in January or February of next year, and it will take until August or September of the same year to complete the transportation. The UK will transport sawmill equipment, tunnel railway equipment, and heavy electrical equipment to the Soviet Union. The loading and unloading ports in the Soviet Union will be ports on the Black Sea.

The intention was probably to ensure that the young woman would not be lonely after death.</p>

<h3>Year-End Bonus Method Passed; Based on One Month's Salary in Principle, Calculated According to the Current Month's Index; If Dispute Mediation Fails, the Arbitration Committee Will Judge</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The city's method for factories and businesses to pay year-end bonuses this year was drafted after the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and China Textile Construction Company to study the matter in detail. It was passed by the Municipal Government Conference yesterday, and the contents are as follows: The year-end bonus for 1947 is, in principle, one month's salary. Factories and businesses that are unable to afford it due to poor business performance may shorten it. Those that have suffered losses due to poor business performance, after verification, may not pay it. Factories and businesses may negotiate the aforementioned bonuses with the labor side based on their business conditions. Piece-rate workers in factories, except for temporary employees, should be handled in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. Temporary workers should still be handled according to last year's precedent. The employees of public utility enterprises should still be handled according to precedent by the competent authority. Employees who have not worked for a full year should have their bonuses reduced proportionally based on their months of service, but it should not be less than one-twelfth. Year-end bonuses should be calculated based on the cost of living index for the month in which they are paid, but if there is a custom, the custom should be followed. If factories and businesses have economic difficulties, they may pay the aforementioned bonuses in installments. If disputes arise between factories and businesses due to the payment of bonuses, they should apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. If mediation fails, they should immediately submit the matter to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration. After the arbitration, neither the labor nor the management side may object. During the mediation or arbitration period, neither side may engage in any illegal behavior.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Workers in Two Districts Petition for Year-End Bonus</h3>

<h3>Fresh Fish Dumping Dispute: Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Arrives in Shanghai Today to Discuss Solutions with Both Parties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the dispute between the city's fish market and the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) over unloading fish, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng will arrive today to discuss solutions with both parties. Zuo was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to an important meeting in Nanjing, he was unable to leave and instead departed from Nanjing by overnight train yesterday, arriving in Shanghai this morning. According to an UNRRA spokesperson who spoke to reporters: The report that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng will come to Shanghai to "mediate" the dispute between the fish market and UNRRA over unloading fish is inappropriate. This matter does not require "mediation." UNRRA's purpose in bringing in large quantities of fish is to assist the Chinese government in suppressing fish prices, so that ordinary people can have fish to eat, and to alleviate some of the material shortages. We cannot allow the reduced profits of a small number of fishermen to affect the living burden of the majority of the people. Therefore, UNRRA insists that every fish caught must be supplied to the people.</p>
<p>Regarding UNRRA's allocation of fishing vessels, the spokesperson stated that UNRRA cannot temporarily sell fishing vessels to fishermen because there is a lack of Chinese technical personnel to operate the new-style vessels. There are no other reasons. The Fishery Management Office is actively training 253 young technical personnel to operate the various machines on the 126 new-style fishing vessels. They are studying diligently and achieving satisfactory results. Once the training period is complete, they will be allocated to fishermen along with the new fishing vessels. The 180 foreign personnel who previously taught technical personnel at the Fuxing Island Fishery Management Office are gradually returning to their countries. By January 1 of next year, only 50 personnel are planned to remain at the Fishery Management Office, which is under the control of the Post-War Relief Committee. Currently, there are 685 Chinese personnel working on fishing vessels and as mechanical staff. UNRRA has allocated US$26 million to train Chinese fishery personnel and revitalize China's fisheries.</p>
<h3>Fishery Representatives Petition Against UNRRA Dumping</h3>
<p>Local private fishery businesses complain that UNRRA is using relief fishing vessels to fish in Chinese territorial waters and dump the catch in Shanghai, causing fish prices to plummet. Private fishery companies feel they cannot survive, leading to repeated disputes with UNRRA fishing vessels. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from various private fishery companies petitioned the Fishery Development Research Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, submitting a written appeal.</p>
<h3>Zhao Junmai Assumes Post as Director of the UNRRA Fishery Management Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhao Junmai, Director of the UNRRA Fishery Management Office, and Ai Ningsi, Deputy Director, along with Chief Secretary Xia Yanru and staff member Wang Shishen, went to the office on Fuxing Island yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to take up their new posts.</p>
<h3>Pig, Cattle, and Sheep Industry Petitions the City Council: Inspection Methods Are Not Entirely Appropriate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fresh Pig Business Association, Pig Trade Business Association, Cattle and Sheep Business Association, and other five groups, as well as representatives of fresh pig traders, jointly petitioned the Shanghai City Council yesterday. They stated that the livestock slaughter inspection methods announced by the Health Bureau, scheduled to be implemented on December 1, are not entirely appropriate in content and are difficult to implement. Therefore, they requested that the council forward a letter to the authorities to revise and halt the methods. They stated two reasons: The safety of pork, beef, and mutton is related to the health of citizens. Therefore, the meat must be inspected by a veterinarian after slaughter before it can be sold in the market. This post-slaughter inspection is very reasonable. However, the methods require an additional inspection before slaughter, which duplicates work and increases the risk of livestock injury when there is a surge in supply. Pre-slaughter inspection was implemented before the war due to the lack of unified administration in the concessions. Now that Shanghai's administration is unified, there is no need for duplicate procedures. According to Article 5 of the methods, dead livestock will be handed over to the diseased livestock processing plant, and a price of 30,000 yuan will be paid per head. The processing plant can earn 850,000 yuan. Such a measure is unreasonable and puts merchants at too great a disadvantage. According to information obtained by reporters from the City Council, pig traders had previously complained about the drawbacks of implementing pre-slaughter inspection in Shanghai. For example, the staff employed by the processing plant would obstruct and forcibly inspect livestock that were not diseased before a veterinarian had legally certified them. The council has forwarded a letter to the Health Bureau to investigate and verify the situation, but has not yet received a response. The council has not yet received the city government's letter to review the livestock slaughter inspection methods.</p>
<h3>Pork Has Nothing to Do With Thrift: 80,000 Pigs Slaughtered Monthly</h3>

<h3>Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe: Preparing to Continue Performances at Lower Prices; Nearly a Thousand People Participate in Today's Garden Party and Photography Event</h3>

<h3>Over a Hundred Railway Spikes Loose: Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Passenger Train Delayed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Line's upward-bound ordinary passenger train No. 42 for second and third class passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 5:00 PM, delayed by four hours and forty-five minutes. Train No. 24 was delayed by four hours. This was because at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a track inspection crew discovered that over a hundred railway spikes were loosened not far from the Hangzhou station, so they telegraphed the Hangzhou station to stop the train's departure and immediately began repairs. The repairs were completed at approximately 8:00 AM, so the Jinling Express was able to depart on time. The truth was unclear for a time, causing widespread suspicion. After the Police Department, along with the Engineering Department and the Hangzhou station, thoroughly investigated, it was discovered that the No. 27 express train for first and second class passengers, which departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou at 10:45 PM the previous evening, had an additional locomotive attached to it for standby use in Hangzhou. When it was passing the Jianqiao station at approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning and about to arrive in Hangzhou, the attached locomotive suddenly experienced a malfunction, shifting a section of the steel rail and loosening over a hundred railway spikes. Because it was late at night and drizzling at the time, it was not discovered at the time.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Female Judge Case: Zhu Huangfangbai Fined 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Zhu Huangfangbai, who was accused of impersonating a female judge, was sentenced yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Yuhuang in the Ninth Criminal Court. The main text of the judgment reads:</p>
<p>"Zhu Huangfangbai is publicly punished with a fine of 50,000 yuan for openly using the title of a public official." Zhu Huangfangbai was sitting alone in the Venus Dance Hall on June 28, sipping tea when Zhou Jiahua and others suspected her of being a dancer and asked her to dance. Zhu considered it an insult, and a conflict arose in their words. The Songshan Police Station mediated the matter. However, Zhu had claimed to be a judge of the court, which caught the attention of Cha Liangjian, the president of the court. However, Cha found that there was no such person in the court, so he sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate and prosecute her.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau Official Embezzlement Case: Five Defendants Sentenced to Five Years; Miao Boyan and Zhang Baonian Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Gao Shijie, an auditor of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, and ten others accused of embezzlement, was sentenced yesterday in the District Court. After Judge Hu Zhichao ascended to the Third Criminal Court, all seven defendants except the three who were at large were present to hear the judgment. Judge Hu stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, and Yang Renzheng are each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly using their positions to fraudulently obtain property without success. Zou Wenlong is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for helping in the fraud. Miao Boyan and Zhang Baonian are both innocent." He then sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: When the defendants were investigating whether various businesses had evaded taxes, they did not act in accordance with the tax bureau's regulations. The tax bureau's regulations stipulate that the maximum fine for tax-evading businesses is 25 million yuan. Based on the tax evasion situation of Zhang Wantai Company, it should be fined 10 million yuan. However, the defendants demanded 70 to 80 million yuan to 100 million yuan from the various woodware companies. Their attempt to extort money is very obvious. Regarding Zou Wenlong's part, it was found that a woodware merchant asked Zheng Gongda, an official of the Tax Bureau, to come forward to negotiate, and Zheng then transferred the matter to Zou Wenlong for negotiation. After Zou obtained the bribe, he transferred it to his own account. The evidence of malpractice is conclusive. Tax Bureau Supervisor Miao Boyan was only responsible for investigation, and Zhang Baonian did not participate in the solicitation of bribes, so they cannot be convicted of embezzlement. Therefore, they are found not guilty. After the sentencing, Miao Boyan remained on his original bail, Zhang Baonian was granted bail, and the remaining defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Sale of Enemy Property With a Deadline for Eviction: 100,000 Households in Panic; Forming a Friendship Association to Appeal for Sympathy and Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Nearly 8,000 households in the city living in enemy property are in a state of panic due to the China Trust Bureau's plan to implement a sales policy, and the government's regulations stipulating that residents must vacate the premises within a limited time. A Friendship Association for Enemy Property Residents was organized to host legal, economic experts, and members of the press at Room 946 of the Youth Association at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, requesting that they express their views on this issue and provide sympathy and support. In addition to more than 50 resident representatives, Duanmu Kai, Zhou Yizhi, Wu Chengxi, and others attended and expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Declaring the Standpoint That There Is No Background</p>
<p>Liu Dejian, Director of the Zhabei District Health Office, chaired yesterday's reception and first explained that the residents are public education personnel who returned to Shanghai from the rear. The houses they currently live in were allocated to them. Given the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, they are currently unable to move or purchase housing. If the China Trust Bureau implements the sales policy, more than 100,000 people will be displaced, which will affect social stability. What the residents are currently fighting for is the right to use the property, and they do not oppose the government's policy. The organization of the Friendship Association has absolutely no political or party background.</p>
<p>Establishing Custody Agreements is a Unilateral Constraint</p>
<p>Then, three questions were raised: What is the difference between the rent and the custody fee collected by the China Trust Bureau? What major assistance does the sales policy provide to finance, and are there any alternative solutions? The enemy property sales policy has been changed repeatedly. Please study and provide opinions to the attendees. After the discussion began, resident representatives expressed their views. The main points were: The custody fee has no legal basis, so its nature is no different from rent. Initially, the China Trust Bureau required residents to sign a "custody agreement," stating that the property could be recovered at any time and collecting a usage fee instead of rent. This is a unilateral constraint. In principle, residents are acting as custodians of enemy property for the China Trust Bureau and should not have to pay a usage fee. It is not in line with Shanghai's general customs that they pay a fee similar to rent and yet the rental rights are not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Residents' Right of Use Should Still Be Retained</p>
<p>If more than 100,000 residents are forced to move within a month, it will have a major impact on social stability and will further exacerbate the city's housing shortage. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can change its approach, postpone the sale, or separate the sale rights from the usage rights. Enemy property can be sold, but residents should retain the right to use the property. Change the current sales policy to give residents priority in purchasing. If residents cannot afford it, the status quo should be maintained. However, in order to increase financial revenue, it may be possible to reasonably increase the security deposit and rent. If the enemy and puppet housing is sold to increase the national treasury, the building of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund and the residences of important figures in the French Concession should be sold first, and the focus should not be on the alley houses in the Hongkou District, otherwise it would be unfair.</p>
<p>No Supplement to Finance Appeal to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Zhou Yizhi, a lawyer, contributed his opinion, believing that the Friendship Association should submit a petition to the Executive Yuan before the China Trust Bureau implements the policy. He also pointed out that the spirit of the Housing Leasing Regulations promulgated by the Legislative Yuan on the first of this month is to protect residents, and the vast majority of enemy property residents are public education personnel who returned from the rear. They followed the government westward during the war and endured hardship. They should now be protected by the government. Duanmu Kai, a lawyer, continued to speak, saying that in addition to the public relationship between the government and the people, they should be on an equal footing in private. If the people live in enemy houses and government agencies live in enemy houses, the same methods should be used in handling them to be fair. When Wu Chengxi spoke, he opposed the current policy, believing that it would not provide much financial assistance, whether for industry or housing. In the past, enemy and puppet industries should have been operated by the state and not sold separately, which would only benefit the wealthy. As for the sale of enemy housing, it is unnecessary because the occupied value of enemy housing in the first half of this year was only 200 billion to 300 billion yuan, and today it is at most 1 trillion yuan. The government's monthly expenditure is currently 5 trillion, which is only one week's worth of use. Therefore, it is better to increase the rent moderately than to sell it. The discussion had gone on for more than five hours. The chairman first thanked the attendees and summarized the various issues, stating that he would appeal to the Executive Yuan immediately, and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Concubine of the Puppet Nanjing Mayor Yang Xichen Concealed Illegal Property Privately Transferred Houses and Fled with Suitcases Investigation Completed and Prosecution Filed</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Yang Xichen (also known as Yang Yuxiu), the concubine of Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing who has been sentenced to death, once caused a sensation by sneaking into prison to meet with Zhou. The High Prosecutor's Office has now prosecuted Yang for the crime of "concealing illegal property." The part about Junzhan is a common criminal matter and was instructed to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. Because Yang attempted to conceal Zhou's property after Zhou was arrested, in April of the thirty-fifth year, she used the name Yang Yuxiu to rent Room 6, 3rd Floor, 376 Nanchang Road (also known as Huanlong Road) from the Ascott Apartments office to hide Zhou's illegal property. A secret informer, Lu Dawei, reported this to the Central Trust Bureau's Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy-Puppet Property Liquidation Office. On April 17 of the thirty-sixth year, the office sent personnel to seal it off, draw up a list, and order Yang Yichen to take custody of it. Because she did not go through the bail procedure, Yang took the opportunity to privately transfer the house and furniture to Jewish Far East Bishop Ashkenazi and Polish Milner to undertake it. Later, the office discovered the previous situation and sent personnel to investigate. Yang fled with a suitcase and other items. After the High Prosecutor's Office investigated the case, it determined that Yang was suspected of violating Article 12 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and filed a public prosecution according to law.</p>

<h3>Actively Launching the Invasion of China: Military Tribunal Indicts Masatoshi Honda</h3>

<h3>Pinghu-Shanyang Boat Massacre: Main Culprits Li Ami and Others on Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Pinghu on the 11th] The massacre that occurred a few years ago on the Pinghu-Shanyang scheduled boat, in which thirteen people were killed by bandits, was tried in public by the local court on the 10th. The main culprits, Li Ami, Zhu Jingen, Qian A’kui, and others, were brought to trial together. The road to the courthouse was blocked by spectators. At precisely 10 a.m., the court first summoned the daughter of Wei A’qi, the owner of the Shanyang boat, who was one of the victims. She testified: "On the 3rd day of the 12th lunar month last year, the Shanyang boat set sail and returned from Jinshan the next day. Zhu saw it at the port in the evening, and knew something was up. It wasn't until the 5th day that we learned that the incident had happened at Baitang port. All the crew and passengers were tragically drowned in the river." Then, the main culprit, Li Ami, was summoned. Li testified: "I am from Jinshanwei and live in Fuxing Lane. I am a salt farmer. The idea of robbing the Shanyang boat came from my friends Wang Jinsheng and Xi Degen. We discussed robbing the Shanyang boat in Langxia, Jinshan. At that time, Xi Degen held a Thompson submachine gun, and Qian A’kui and Shen A’yu each had a pistol. There were eight of us who went to rob the boat. We waited until 4 p.m. at the Baitang port. Wang Jinsheng was the first to act. We robbed more than two million, and I got more than one hundred thousand. After the robbery, we tied a female passenger, Wang Meimei, to Luxiang. But we did not rape her. We strangled her with a rope. I don't know about the rest." Then, Zhu Jingen was summoned. Zhu testified: "At that time, because Wang Meimei knew Li Ami, we took her away to silence her. To silence her, we threw the people on the boat into the river and drowned them with large stones." The local court appointed lawyer Ding Yuchang for the defense. The court ruled that the defendants should be remanded in custody to await further questioning.</p>

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education established more schools one after another to accommodate displaced and out-of-school youth. By the eve of victory, the number had increased to 111. In the summer vacation of 1946, the schools began to return to their original locations. Except for a small number of schools established during the war that continued to operate, the rest were taken over or closed down by the provinces and cities. All staff and students of the schools were sent back to their hometowns and were accommodated by the educational departments of the provinces and cities by establishing schools or classes. However, all expenses were still paid by the Ministry of Education. Currently, a total of 672 classes have been established across the country, which can accommodate 2,688 teachers and staff members and 33,600 students. The number of classes established in each province and city is as follows: Jiangsu 90, Zhejiang 60, Anhui 60, Jiangxi 31, Hubei 66, Hunan 46, Sichuan 84, Fujian 10, Guangdong 10, Guangxi 5, Henan 60, Hebei 10, Shanxi 5, Shandong 10, Shaanxi 5, Gansu 5, Yunnan 40, Chongqing 61, Beijing 30, Beiping 5, Tianjin 3, Shanghai 10, Qingdao 4.</p>

<p>Strong Buying Momentum in Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Yong Yarn Sets New High Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the news regarding Chinese stocks varied. The market opened weakly but then recovered, with new buying and short covering expanding repeatedly. The market improved as it progressed, and the afternoon saw further expansion. Yong Yarn and Xinhuo set new high prices. The holiday schedule for the end of the year and the New Year had already been announced, covering a long period, and settlements had to be completed within the year, causing some hesitation and weakness. Yong Yarn opened at 409 yuan and 422 yuan, but spot sales reached 394 yuan and forward sales reached 406 yuan. Out-of-market trading opened before formal trading, with interest rates rising to 25.5 cents and 30 cents, contributing to the initial weakness. Later, due to increased demand for spot and forward trades, buying interest from the Nanjing group was triggered, leading to a rally, and the buying momentum intensified, pushing prices back up to 406 yuan and 421 yuan. Prices then rose further to 427 yuan and 445 yuan before retreating to 415 yuan and 430 yuan. At this point, rumors fueled buying, further intensifying the rally, pushing spot prices to a high of 432 yuan and forward prices to a high of 454 yuan. Around noon, prices briefly fell to 420 yuan and 440 yuan before recovering to close at 427 yuan and 448 yuan. Sino-French stocks improved as they progressed, while Xinhuo, Huafeng, and the "Three Little Ones" also closely followed, with significant gains. As a result, spot stocks of Sino-French, Huafeng, and Xinhuo rose by over 10%, while Jingfu, Meiya, Huaxin, Zhabei, Tongyi, China Silk, Matches, National Goods, and Yonggong rose by 5%. Xinya remained flat, China Textile slightly decreased, and the rest showed slight increases. Forward stocks of Qinxing and Huafeng rose by 10%, while the rest rose by 5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, evening newspapers reported the passage of a 60 million loan, boosting sentiment after the opening, with Yong Yarn forward sales reaching 442 yuan, accompanied by bizarre rumors, boosting confidence. Sino-French and Xinhuo Porcelain both reached their limit up, and Rongfeng also reached its limit. Yong Yarn rose to a new high of 455 yuan for spot and 471 yuan for forward. With a difference of over 100 billion yuan in National Bank entries, prices retreated to within 445 yuan and 460 yuan. Before the close, prices fell to 442 yuan and 455 yuan, with Sino-French, Xinhuo, and Huafeng reaching their limit up. As a result, compared to the morning close, spot stocks of Sino-French, Xinhuo, and Huafeng reached their limit up, Rongfeng recovered after reaching its limit up, and Yong Yarn, Meiya, Jinglun, and China Cement also rose by 5%, with the rest showing slight increases. Forward stocks of Huafeng and Meiya each rose by about 5%, with the rest showing slight increases. Out-of-market, buying was mainly concentrated in old stocks.</p>

<p>Textile Construction and Textile Adjustment Continue to Allot</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Sales Are Slow, Cloth Market Slightly Firm Before Close, Spot Cotton Trends Weak</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company and the Textile Adjustment Committee continued to sell yarn yesterday. However, due to tight credit conditions and severe shortages of acceptance bills, Textile Construction sold a total of 542 bales, equivalent to 954 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 330 applications. In addition to selling 308 bales of various counts of yarn, the Textile Adjustment Committee also routinely allotted 131 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 114 applicants. The opening price of Textile Construction remained the same, calculated based on 28.11 million yuan for 20-count yarn. The Textile Adjustment Committee's bidding prices were 30 million yuan for 20-count yarn, 15.4 million yuan for 6-count yarn, 39 million yuan for 32-count yarn, 42 million yuan for 40-count yarn, and 47.5 million yuan for 42-count double-ply yarn.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the cotton yarn market situation yesterday was stable due to the unchanged price of yarn allotted by Textile Construction Company, which manufacturers and colleagues can apply for. However, after hearing that the authorities continued to sell in large quantities, buying interest from all parties weakened, and credit remained tight, with few buyers appearing, prices gradually declined. By the close, there was a slight recovery, but the closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to fall by 1.4 million compared to the previous day's close, falling to 47.2 million yuan. The market for other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined by 200,000 to over 1 million yuan to varying degrees.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the opening this morning was due to the large supply sold by Textile Construction Company every other day. Although the market had sufficient chips and buyers were willing to purchase, the restrictions on remittances and the tighter position of the industry led to a lot of selling, and asking prices gradually loosened. Towards the close, small dye factories took advantage of the low prices to buy, and retail investors also became active. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, rose by 12,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market for bleached cloth also improved slightly, and the market for other cloths showed a clear, stable, and firm trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market trended weak, with buyers having urgent credit needs and very little acceptance of bills, leading to sluggish transactions, with a turnover of 250 bales. 4.96 million were sent to factories in Shashi, 4.795 million for warehouse delivery, 3.637 million for fire engines, and 945,000 for Zhoupu cottonseed.</p>
<p>Oil and Grease Industry Asks for Increased Allocation of Diesel to Increase Kerosene Production</p>
<p>The Shanghai Oil and Grease Commercial Association, for the purpose of applying for the allocation of diesel oil for the oil refineries of its members, specially submitted a document to the Import and Export Control Committee, stating that the kerosene refineries among its members, in view of the fact that kerosene is a daily necessity for the public, and even more so because of the current fuel shortage and the public's need, and because the import of foreign kerosene is subject to quota controls, have established factories for refining in succession in order to seek remedies. The products of each factory have been gradually refined and improved, and are no less than those imported from abroad. Although the Social Bureau previously ordered the cessation of refining, the association presented a detailed statement of reasons to the municipal government, which approved the revocation of the order and agreed to cultivate each record. However, the refining of kerosene relies on diesel oil as the main raw material, and each refinery previously turned to domestic orders through importers. With the establishment of the Transportation Management Committee, it is impossible to directly order. Now that Lianhuo Shan has been recognized by the authorities as important, it should be cultivated, and the need for raw materials should be requested from the Transportation Management Committee to allocate Chai Shan, so as to ensure industrial safety and meet the main purpose of planting machinery. In addition to submitting to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office for assistance in applying for approval, a list of the names and production quantities of each oil refinery will be attached at any time. Please allocate diesel oil.</p>
<p>Central Sand and Taiwan Red Continue to Be Tight</p>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw continuous rises in central sand, white Taiwan, and red sand due to shortages, while the rest showed slight loosening. The association's trading price was 1.15 million yuan for the two-four-group white small package, and 1.12 million yuan for the small package. The spot price for large packages was still 1.189 million yuan. The spot price for 20 central sand white was 1.165 million yuan, up 10,000 yuan. Taiwan red was 1.17 million yuan.</p>
<p>People's Livelihood Coal Allocation Price</p>
<p>The Fuel Group Has Resolved It</p>

It rose by 120% compared to the last time.</p>

<p>Trade in foreign tea is mostly stagnant, and domestic flower varieties continue to be absorbed by the main street stores.</p>
<p>The cigarette market was weak yesterday morning and recovered in the afternoon. Ten Big British Old Knives rose by 650,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other high-grade cigarettes also rose slightly.</p>
<p>The soap market is still expensive due to caustic soda, and door stores and colleagues are absorbing it. The prices of Guban, Arrow, Daoguang, and Guanghua soaps are rising by 12,000 yuan. Matches are also rising by 1020,000, and foreign candles are rising by 20,000, with Chicken Brand priced at 940,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Culture and History Hu Shi's Inscription on the Zhai Family Collection of Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower Ming Manuscript of the Water Classic Commentary Hu Shi</p>
<p>On September 5, the 36th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu Senyu and I visited the Qu brothers in Changshu and met Mr. Xuchu. He was kind enough to show us the Ming manuscript of the Water Classic Commentary, formerly from his family's collection in the Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower. I wrote a few notes at the time, and only after returning to Beiping did I write this inscription.</p>
<p>Of the existing Ming manuscripts and Song editions, I have only seen these three complete:</p>
<p>Yongle Encyclopedia Edition</p>
<p>Changshu Qu Family Collection Edition</p>
<p>Haiyan Zhu Family Collection Edition</p>
<p>Among these three editions, the Encyclopedia edition is the most complete. The Qu and Zhu editions both have many misplaced pages. Mr. Qu Fengqi once proofread and corrected the misplaced pages in the Qu edition using the Encyclopedia edition. Last year, I wrote a postscript to the Zhu edition, also pointing out that in volume 38 alone, there were fourteen misplaced pages. The Ming manuscripts of the Water Classic Commentary that I have seen, apart from the Encyclopedia edition, do not have the volume and page numbers marked on the binding seams, so they are most prone to misplaced pages. (The Water Classic Commentary fragment in the Lianhu Academy manuscript collection of the Tianjin Library is also a Ming manuscript and Song edition, and also does not have volume and page numbers.)</p>
<p>This book is written in blue silk-lined paper, with ten lines per half page and twenty characters per line, but there are also twenty-two or twenty-three characters per line. It is bound in twelve volumes, each with the "Haiyu" seal at the beginning, as well as the seals "Wu Shengqin Yin" and "Baihua." Mr. Xu Senyu and Mr. Zhao Ziyun both said that "Haiyu" is Xu Xuemo. Xu Xuemo was a Jinshi in the 29th year of Jiajing, born in the first year of Jiajing (1522) and died in the 21st year of Wanli (1593). Wu Shengqin was born in the seventh year of Yongzheng (1729) and died in the eighth year of Jiaqing (1863). Xu Xuemo had 79 volumes of the Haiyu Collection and also compiled 98 volumes of the General History of Huguang. This Qu edition comes from his family and is a manuscript from the 16th century, its transcription date is not far from the era of the Encyclopedia reprint and the era of Huang Shengzeng's engraved Water Classic Commentary (1534). (The Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower Book Collection Catalog, volume 11, page 14, records this book, only noting the seals "Wu Shengqin Yin" and "Baihua," without noting the "Haiyu" seal.)</p>
<p>The Qu edition has a preface by Li Daoyuan, with half a page of 220 characters missing in the middle. The Liu Dazhong manuscript Song edition also has this preface, and also lacks this half page. This shows that the Qu edition and the Liu Dazhong edition probably come from the same source. The Zhu edition and the Huang Shengzeng engraved edition do not have the preface. The Encyclopedia has the full text of the preface.</p>
<p>In volume 6, the Huisui chapter quotes a passage from the ancient text Suoyu, the Huang Shengzeng edition (page 12) reads:</p>
<p>...Duke asked Shi Kuang about the deity of Shouyang...</p>
<p>There is a large body fox tail, its name is Rizhe drinking alcohol. The Zhu and Qu editions (with misplaced pages in the Qu edition at this point) are the same as the Huang edition, both writing "there is a large" (large is a mistake for dog), and both writing "its name is Rizhe." The Song engraved fragment collected by Mr. Fu Yuanshu is also like this. The Encyclopedia edition also writes "there is a large," but a "missing" character is noted next to "its name is Ri." (The Taiping Yulan, volume 40, quotes this text, leaving five characters blank after "its name is Ri.")</p>
<p>Using the above two standards, it can be seen that the Encyclopedia edition and the other editions seem to come from different sources.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia edition has the full text of the preface.</p>
<p>The Liu Dazhong and Qu editions both have this preface.</p>
<p>The Huang Shengzeng and Zhu editions both do not have this preface.</p>
<p>In the Suisui chapter, "its name is Rizhe," the Encyclopedia edition writes "its name is Ri Zhe."</p>
<p>The Qu and Zhu editions write "its name is Rizhe."</p>
<p>The Huang edition writes "its name is Rizhe."</p>
<p>In volume 8, the Jisui chapter records Fan Juqing's grave, the Huang Shengzeng edition (page 19) writes "Fan Juqing's grave, the name pieces still exist." The Qu edition, the Zhu edition, and the Encyclopedia edition all write "a name piece." The Southern Song Hong Shi Lishi quotes this text, also writing "name piece." (This part is incomplete in the surviving Song edition.) The Wu Guan engraved edition first changed "name pieces still exist" to "stone pillars still exist." Mi Mouyu, Yuan Chun, Xiang Xi, and Huang Chen all follow the Wu Guan edition and write "stone pillars." Quan Xieshan and Zhao Dongqian also write "stone pillars." The two Dai Jianyuan editions both follow the ancient edition and write "name pieces." "Name piece" is a noun that is still in use in Quanzhou today. The Wu Guan edition's alteration is unfounded.</p>
<p>In volume 16, the Shuisui chapter records the Qianjin Canal project in the most detail. The Huang Shengzeng edition (page 6) has this sentence:</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang, broke the Qianjin Canal, and officials and civilians relied on it.</p>
<p>Having broken the Qianjin Canal, why did officials and civilians "rely on it"? This statement is unreasonable, so Quan Xieshan, Zhao Dongqian, Dai Dongyuan, and others all referred to the Taiping Yulan and the Jin Shu, adding the story of Li Ju and Yuan Fu repairing the Qianjin Canal after "officials and civilians relied on it." Now, examining the Encyclopedia edition, this sentence reads:</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang and broke the Qianjin Canal, officials and civilians stopped.</p>
<p>The Zhu edition is consistent with the Encyclopedia edition. The Qu edition writes this sentence:</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang and broke the Qianjin Canal, officials and civilians immediately stood.</p>
<p>The following text is "water accumulated over the years, the canal was destroyed, the stone masonry was almost exhausted, and the remains are still visible." After we have read that the Encyclopedia and Zhu editions write "officials and civilians stopped," and the Qu edition writes "officials and civilians immediately stood," we can naturally realize that this sentence originally read "officials and civilians immediately lacked water," and the full text should read:</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang, broke the Qianjin Canal, and officials and civilians immediately lacked water. The canal accumulated over the years was destroyed, the stone masonry was almost exhausted, and the remains are still visible. In the Taihe period of the imperial court (Northern Wei), the old canal was repaired.</p>
<p>With this kind of textual criticism, there is no need to add words. The Jin Shu Hui Emperor's concubine said:</p>
<p>In the second year of Tai'an...in the eleventh month, on the Xin Si day...Zhang Fang destroyed the Qianjin Canal, the water mills were all dry, so he distributed palace slaves to the troops.</p>
<p>This can be used as evidence. The Qu edition's "immediately stood" is closer to "immediately lacked," and can be used for textual criticism.</p>
<p>This book was transcribed by several transcribers, with slight differences in skill, and differences in precision. Sometimes the Qu edition is better than the Zhu edition, such as in volume 3, which records the petroleum of Sun Nanshan in Yanshou County, Jiuquan. The Qu edition writes:</p>
<p>The Transmission of Objects records that the fruit water produced in the southern mountain of Yanshou County, Jiuquan is as large as a dou, and the ground is a ditch, the water has fat, like meat juice. Those who take it in a container, start yellow and then black, like solidified cream. However, it is extremely bright, and the bones are no different. It is very good for coating carriages and water tanks. The locals call it Shisheng. The Zhu edition mistakenly writes "solidified cream" as "doubtful cream," which is not as good as the Qu edition. The last sentence in the Zhu edition is "the locals call it Shishi lacquer," the Qu edition does not repeat the "stone" character, and the "lacquer" character is mistakenly written as "sheng," so there are mutual advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>But sometimes the Qu edition is not as good as the Zhu edition. For example, in volume 34, the Shuisui chapter, quoting Ma Diboshu, there is:</p>
<p>Its height is either thought to be Xiaoboshi or thought to be ice and snow.</p>
<p>The Zhu edition is the same as the Encyclopedia edition. The Qu edition writes:</p>
<p>Its height is either thought to be Xiaoboshi or thought to be water.</p>
<p>Writing "ice and snow" is correct. Huang Shengzeng changed these fourteen characters in the engraved edition to:</p>
<p>Its height is like looking at floating clouds, steep stone walls.</p>
<p>This is based on Liu Zhao's supplement to the Continued History of the Han Dynasty Sacrificial Records, but it is not the original text of the Song edition. Sun Qian's collated edition quotes the Liu Dazhong edition, which is the same as the Encyclopedia and Zhu editions. It can be seen that the ancient editions before the Huang engraved edition are all like this, in which "Boshi" is a mistake for "Baishi." (See Dai Dongyuan's original text for the words revised in this article.)</p>
<p>There is no complete Song engraved edition of the Water Classic Commentary today, but fortunately, the Encyclopedia edition and the Ming manuscripts of the Song editions collected by the Qu and Zhu families are still complete from beginning to end. Huang Shengzeng's engraved edition has fourteen misplaced pages and two missing pages, which these three editions do not mistake. The Encyclopedia edition has the best base edition, but the existing edition is a re-copied edition, with some small omissions. These two Ming manuscripts should be used to carefully collate and add the collation of the remaining Song edition of eleven volumes to restore a Song edition of the Water Classic Commentary. The Qu edition has Xu Haiyu's seal. The transcription date is between Jiajing and Wanli at the latest. The remnant of Li Daoyuan's preface that it preserves is the same as the Liu Dazhong edition, so it seems to be earlier than the manuscript collected by the Zhu family. (36, 9, 13 midnight)</p>
<p>Discussing "Arranging Music Sequences" with Mr. Lu Yiye Yan Zie</p>
<p>Lu Yiye's "An Outline of Chinese Drama" (published by the Shanghai World Book Company) has the following passage in the third chapter, "The Prosperity of Song Drama":</p>
<p>"The 'Arranging Music Sequences' in Zhou Mi's Old Affairs of Wulin is the origin of the modern 'playbill.' It is also somewhat like the scenario of a play."</p>
<p>The material on which this passage is based is the "Arranging Music Sequences for the Holy Birthday of Tianji" in the first volume of Old Affairs of Wulin:</p>
<p>"First, the music plays Sheng, ascending Linchun Introduction by Wang Rongzu, First Cup, Ascending Long Live Liangzhou Melody Breaking Qi Ruxian, Dance Head Hao Junmai Dance Tail Fan Zongmao, Second Cup, Ascending Lingshou Yong Singing Songzi Lu Enxian, Pipa Playing Peng Yaozhi Slow by Wang Rongzu, Third Cup, Singing Yanshou Chang Singing Songzi Li Wenqing, Harmonica Playing Huashao Moon Slow by Li Song, Fourth Cup, Jade Axis Pipa Solo Playing Zhenghuang Palace Fu Shou Yongkang Ning Yuning, Beating Wang Liangqing, Sheng Ascending Qingshou Xin by Zhou Run, Entering Playing Zi (Song carved Tan Zi) Flute Whistle by Pan Jun, Staff Drum Song Yaoqing, Beating Wang Liangqing, Entering Giving Words etc. Shihe, Bowing to Hua Shu Jijie, Yao Gui First Five Days of Spring, Wang Li starts auspiciously, the holy world opens the destiny of Qianling, cheering the four seas, overflowing the great court, respectfully thinking of His Majesty the Emperor is wise as Yao... respectfully presenting slogans.

<p>An Examination of the Stone Drum Inscription Being Carved in the Third Year of Qin Linggong Tang Lan</p>
<p>The Curse of Chu inscription has six "I" characters, three "Wu" characters, the boundary between "I" and "Wu" is not very clear, and there is no "Zhen" character.</p>
<p>Luo Zhenyu thought that the Qin Gong Yuan Bell was from the time of Duke Mu, and Guo Moruo thought it was from the time of Duke Jing. The inscription says: "Twelve Dukes," Guo's statement is probably credible. It can be seen that in the time of Duke Jing (576-537 BC), the character "Zhen" was still used and not "Bi" or "Wu," but in the Curse of Chu inscription made in the time of Duke Huiwen due to the five kingdoms attacking Qin (318 BC), "Wu" was used instead of "Zhen." The Stone Drum Inscription is close to the Curse of Chu inscription, its era will definitely not be earlier than the Qin Gong Yuan Bell or the Duke Mu inscription.</p>
<p>The Qin Gong Yuan Bell and the Qin Gong Zhong do not have the characters "Ou" or "Ye." The character "Lei" has never been seen in bronze ware before the Spring and Autumn period. The Chen Chang Tao Kettle from the late Spring and Autumn period has the character "Ye," and the Stone Drum Inscription uses the character "Ou" twice. The Ya Chi edition and the Wu Cheng edition of the Curse of Chu inscription say: "To save oneself," the Qiu Yuan edition writes "Ye." The Xin Mu Tiger Tally uses the character "Ou," and the Qin weights and measures use the character "Ye," sometimes also using "Ou." It can be seen that the Stone Drum Inscription should be after the late Spring and Autumn period.</p>
<p>The "Yu" character in the Stone Drum Inscription has a radical derived from "Yu."</p>
<p>Based on this evidence, we can point out that the Stone Drum Inscription should be after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. However, it calls the ruler "Gong" instead of "Wang," and comparing it with the Shang Yang measurements, the script is much more complex, so it should be before Duke Xiao of Qin, that is, from 481 BC (the year Chen Chang assassinated Duke Jian and Xiang Ping of Lu) to 361 BC (the first year of Duke Xiao of Qin).</p>
<p>The Stone Drums were unearthed in Tianxing County Santiyuan, now Fengxiang County, which was the Qin Yongyi. The Records of the Grand Historian Justice in the Qin Benji commentary Santiyi quote Kuo Di Zhi saying:</p>
<p>"Santiyuan is located twenty south of Qizhou Yongxian. Duke Wen of Qin built Shantiyi, Duke Xiang built Xiyi, and Duke Ling built Wuyang. Shangyi, all on this plain, hence the name."</p>
<p>In the past, scholars mostly believed that the inscription was related to the construction of the sacrifice, so they always placed it in the time of Duke Wen or Duke Xiang. According to my view, the inscription is indeed related to the construction of the sacrifice (a detailed examination elsewhere), but the era is wrong. According to Fengyi Shu, Duke Xiang lived in the west and built Xiyi, so Xiyi would never be in Yongyi, the Kuo Di Zhi quoted above is wrong. Justice quotes Kuo Di in the Miyi commentary</p>
<p>"The Han Dynasty had five sacrifices in Qizhou Yongxian, namely, Jiyi, Wuyang Shangyi, Xiayi, Miyi, and Beiyi."</p>
<p>There is no Xiyi. Beiyi was established by Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty to worship the Black Emperor, originally four sacrifices, Jiyi worshiped the White Emperor, Miyi worshiped the Green Emperor, Wuyang Shangyi worshiped the Yellow Emperor, and Xiayi worshiped the Yan Emperor. Among the four seasons, Miyi is in Weinan, then the Santiyuan in Yongnan should only be Jiyi and Wuyang Shangyi.</p>
<p>Above, I have pointed out that the writing used in the Stone Drum Inscription will definitely not be in the Spring and Autumn period, so it is obviously wrong to say that it is the inscription of Jiyi or associate it with Chen Baizhi and the like. However, what is the significance of these ten inscriptions being unearthed in Santiyuan? I remember Mr. Xu Xusheng said that this kind of large stone is not produced in Fengxiang, but is common in Chencang, south of the Wei River. Then, what is the purpose of transporting this kind of large stone to carved inscriptions at a great expense between Paiyong?</p>
<p>From the comparison of the script, I concluded that among these 120 years of the Stone Drum, the Qin state only had one major event in Yongyi, which was the third year of Duke Ling. This was after Duke De fought Yong and Duke Xuan built Miyi, after an interval of 250 years. These two sacrifices are on Santiyuan, that is, the place where the Stone Drums were unearthed, so there is no doubt that these ten inscriptions were made because of the construction of the sacrifice. This is the reason why the Qin people took the Pai Mountain that they sweated to make as the Wu Mountain, so the inscription mentions Qiyang, and involves King Cheng of Zhou's Qiyang hunt, and also attaches the Xixiyang of the Great Unification Eleventh Year, the Litianyiyang of the Zhenjun Seventh Year, adding to the knowledge that this is Wuyang, so there is no need to be so confusing. The inscription Qiu also mentioned "successor king." The third year of Duke Ling of Qin was the fourth year of King Weilie of Zhou, and it was also newly ascended to the throne, so it can of course be called the successor king.</p>
<p>The Stone Drum Inscription, in any case, does not seem like the work of the Three Hundred Poems at the same time. Now it is set as the third year of Duke Ling, which is already the early Warring States period, so it is no wonder that it is similar to the poems in the Biography of King Mu of Zhou. In ancient history, the historical materials of the early Warring States period are the most lacking, and the Stone Drum Inscription can just fill this gap. If we arrange the Qin ware into:</p>

<h3>Goods Arriving in Both Northern and Southern Cities are Still Abundant, Rice Transactions Gradually Returning to Normal, Oil Beans and Miscellaneous Grains Also Showing Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The northern and southern rice markets resumed normal transactions yesterday. Ji Mingqi, head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally supervised the market opening. The arrival of goods in both cities was still abundant, and the market situation was good. Prices generally fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wu Wenxian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: The government will protect legitimate merchants, but those who illegally raise prices will be severely punished. In the future, when economic police are performing tasks in the market, if they discover acts of disrupting the market and illegally raising prices that require arrest, they should contact the staff of the Social Affairs Bureau stationed at the market. If both parties have different opinions on the handling methods, they can respectively ask the heads of the relevant bureaus for instructions. If an agreement still cannot be reached, they should ask Mayor Wu for a decision.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 15,300 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The southern market was weak at first and then stronger, while the northern market was stable at first and then firm. In the end, there was not much honor or disgrace for japonica rice, and white rice showed its elegance. Flour sales were quite brisk, and prices rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat was average, and wheat bran sales in the countryside were slack, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was stagnant in Taiwan and slack in Shantou, and the upward trend stopped and turned downward. Soybean oil assistance was encountered, and the local market did not look ahead. The intention of oil was lukewarm, depressed, and prices fell by 3,000 to 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The supply and demand of bean are both scarce, and there is not much fluctuation. Red beans and broad beans have no fluctuations. Sorghum is smoothly delivered in the north, increasing sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Corn, on the other hand, fell back by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were not many transactions of sesame in foreign firms, and the situation was a little lackluster. Medium and low-grade sesame were cut by 10,000 yuan, and black sesame also decreased by a small amount of 10,000 yuan. High-quality goods were stable. Raw peanuts were slightly active in the Guangxi area. The demand for fried goods in winter continued, and they remained high and popular, followed by stagnation.</p>
<p>The oil market has re-entered a slump. With the suspension of passenger assistance, raw oil fell sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Vegetable and sesame oil and soybean oil successively fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Refined oil was in a flat and sluggish state. The long-rumored allocated oil is said to be available for sale in a few days, and the procedures are being rushed through.</p>
