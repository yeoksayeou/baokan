<p>〔本報訊〕自國民黨中央十四人委員會決定在京。滬區立委自田競選原則後，此間民。靑兩黨人士之反饗，略有區別，靑年黨發言人謂，原則上並不反對，惟辦法値得商討，不知自由競選是否指國民黨對京·滬區兩黨立委候選人不支持，抑指根本放棄政黨提名之原則，後者我人不同意，因政黨提名並不妨害自由競選。靑年黨京·滬區候選人尙未推定，因京滬爲人文薈萃之區，故將來產生者必爲知名之士，目前之問題爲資望合格者不願任候選人，而多數願作候選人者資望頗有問題，故尙未作最後決定。民社黨某要員則表示：自由競選爲內容問題，而非原則之爭。如眞能在公平之條件下自由競爭，本黨自無反對之意。但如一方佔有特殊之優勢與便利，控制各區保甲之基層組織，則又當別論。</p>

<h3>日外務省草擬　秘密備忘錄　圖締「談判式」和約</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕世界消息週刋今日謂：日本正圖締結一「談判式」之和約，而避免接受一完全聽決於盟國之以無條件投降爲基礎之和約。該週刋披載自東京秘密採得之日本外務省所草擬之秘密備忘錄全文，該備忘錄宣露東京對於和會之策略　據部之齒舞島及色丹島、應仍爲日本領土。並盼留居台灣，澎湖之日人，有選擇國籍之自由。依照該備忘錄之計劃，在日之臺灣人民，將獲得中國籍，惟不得於此等臺灣人獲得中國籍後，向其追索盟國人民財產損失之賠償。依照此項計劃，麥師自日本投降以還，對日政府所下之各項訓令，百萬噸，且可擁有飛機。世界消息週刋分析該項備忘錄後，指出日本所欲保留之其他太平洋島嶼包括千島·琉球·小笠原·琉磺島。並謂：其所欲保留之各島，無一係侵略所得者，日本各報業已遵照日政府之啓示，發動一宣傳運動，俾爲日後日本在和會中之要求預先尋找充份之理由。日本將試圖離間美·蘇，使其對立，俾其本身可與二國締定更寬大之條約。</p>
<h3>中長路重大問題　我即與蘇方談判　鄒尙友日內飛瀋履新</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕新任中長鐵路助理理事長鄒尙友，定日內由京赴滬，搭機飛瀋陽履新。此次該路人事調整，意義至爲重大，因該路之資產管理等重要問題，我方前雖一再通知蘇政府請派員來京商談解決辦法，但迄今蘇方人員尙未派定，故中長路之若干重大間題，至今仍懸而未決。此次該路高級人士之調整，即可視爲我政府準備與蘇方隨時開始商談。由此，亦可證明我政府始終忠實履行中蘇友好條約也。　氏爲我國有數之老外交家，服務外交界前後達廿餘年，並屢代表我國對蘇聯辦理外交舉務，故對蘇辦理外交之經騐至爲豐富。</p>

<h3>我全力戡亂意義友邦應深刻認識　珍珠港事變日吳鐵城發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕八日爲珍珠港事變六週年紀念日，國民黨中央黨都秘書長兼立法院副院長吳鐵城，特向中央社記者發表其對珍珠港事變之感想。因吳氏曾於一九一四年二次革命失敗後亡命檀香山，曾至珍珠港，故對該地之感想特爲深切。吳氏謂：吾人對於盟國共同敵入之襲擊珍珠港，此種不宣而戰，同於中古時代野蠻民族之行爲，雖時逾六年，不但未曾少减其憤慨情緒，而在國際局勢日益複雜危亂之今日，更足引起吾人最大之戒心。綱稱：中國不願再見世界有戰事，無論在任何困難情形之下，有無外援及外援多寡，終必盡其全力，整理其家務，即戡平共黨之叛亂，以免遠東再有九一八事件發生。惟吾人不免引爲遺憾者，中國竭全力以撲滅共產黨在遠東之主力一件大事，尙未被友邦予以廣泛而深刻之認識耳。（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>關於滇緬北段未定界務問題</h3>
<p>緬甸獲得獨立保證後，　備明年一月四日接管英國緬甸之領土。緬甸為我國善鄰，輿論對緬甸獨立，莫不細慶；並期待未來中緬關係，益臻良好而愉快。正常此會，中緬間發生了一件不甚愉快的事，就是因緬甸政府為　緬未定界問題，所發的聲明而引起的誤會。先是，我國內政部方域司　司長角今，於十一月廿五日南京中央日報記者發表講話，分析中國未定界綫懸案解決之途徑，接着緬甸發言人便以我收回江心坡等地一事，表示遺憾，甚至以流血與武力字樣相威脅。我外交部為解釋誤會，乃於本月二日發表聲明，表示滇緬北段未定界務，二國必能本和睦之精神及條約上之規定，求得合法與滿意之解決。此時任何片面之言論或行動，自不能强使對方認為有效。棉甸外交部未獲悉我外部聲明，又於一日表示緬甸國境邊界，早徑載明於官方地圖，不須訴諸聯合國，關於未定界部份，應由雙方協定解決．緬甸決不放棄其領土之任何一部份。此在緬甸政府，為了確保他們的疆土，義正詞嚴：我們固至表同情；但如果因此而牽涉到尙未劃定的中緬國界，則不免令人有遺憾之感。我國外交部得聲明，公正明快，應為緬甸政府暨我國人士所珍視。我們確信滇緬未定界務，決不會形成中緬間不愉快的糾紛；願於此略加申述。</p>
<p>我國與緬甸關係密切，不僅歷史上有光榮的記載，即在地理上和地位上，都有唇齒相依的關係。滇緬交界的區域，在地勢上篇滇省高原的一部分，愈北而由勢亦愈高。著名的川流有　江（又名怒江或　爾溫江），瀾渝江（又名　江），大金沙江（又名伊拉瓦底江或厄勒瓦諦江）；三江支流很多，棋布於滇緬交界。此一地帶，確產豐富，地势險要，尤其是北部，自康藏至尖高山的一段未定界，更為重要。當緬甸內附我國之時，界綫自無嚴格的畫分，自緬甸陷英之後，中緬界務問題，即行發生。中緬界務之商訂，始於光緒十二年（公元一八八六年）的「中英緬甸條約」；其後我國駐英公使薛編成和英外相勞　伯簽訂「中英讀議滇緬界務商務條款」（光緒廿年即一八九四年），大學士李鴻章和英使賽納樂簽訂「中英續議緬甸條約附款」（光緒廿三年即一八九七年），始得雙方界綫分獲規定於條約內。但關於北段未定界（康藏至尖高山段），南段未定界（南丁河至南极河段），因我當時未明邊界實際情形，無從畫定，乃於條約上規定，另派大員查勘定之。满淸外交的因循延誤，遂致釀成日後滇緬邊界上不少的糾紛。</p>
<p>查滇緬界址計分四段：第一段自康廠至尖高山；第二段自尖商山至带丁河；第三段自南丁河至南板河；第四段自南板河至越南。上述四段邊界中，第二段和第四段，係在光緒年間　定；第三段則在民國三十年六月十八日始劃定。惟第一段迄今仍屬懸案，此段適居北緯廿五度三十五分，即由騰衝之尖高山起以北，奄有江心城，野人山，及戶拱河谷（即胡康河谷）諸地，面積約廿萬方公里，與浙江省相埒。英軍侵佔這地帶數十年，我國迭次抗議無效；世界二次大戰一期中，日人侵入緬甸，一度深入滇西。當英軍撤離後，我游擊部隊曾越高　　山，進佑江心坡等地，進行縝密之編保工作。大　終了，我軍後撤，英人重來，不幸又復載前狀態。今英國旣允緬甸獨立，此一段未定界，事實上原為中國之領土，中國行政　曾多次建立於該地區，英緬自應無條件的歸還中國，庶幾懸案得以解決，中緬的鄰誼得以增强。此不僅為我國人民所盼望，且為和平的遠東國家在今日時代中所應共同追求之目標。中緬關係的前途，遠大無垠，不應再有邊界之爭，以不德行　了　定邊界而使用威脅的言詞或行動。</p>
<p>我們對緬甸獲得獨立，曾　予無限的希望。關於中緬劃界問題，我們願以三事期諸中緬兩國政府：第一，關於滇緬北段未定界懸案之解決，兩國應於明年一月前覓取外交途徑，謀疆界談判僵局之打開。在懸案未決之前，任何不友好行動，從增糾紛的因素，希望緬甸政府　復經理，切勿急躁，而作一切感情衝動之行為。第二，我國對滇緬未定界綫之勘查工作，内政部應積極進行，依我地理及方位，依法立定界樁·並設必要之國境警察，恢復編保。第三，滇緬未定界務之父涉，不屬於内政範圍，主管片面的談話，容易引起誤會，徒然增加外交困難，以後我國應持愼重之態度。憶光緒十一年，曾紀澤出使英法，為滇緬界綫一時發言錯誤，遂增後來交涉之重大困難，曾氏莫能辭其咎，故發言不可不愼。</p>
<p>滇緬未定界懸案的解決，祗要中緬於外交關係建立後，開誠商談，金石為開，實不難獲得成功的。我們確信緬甸新興的政治家，有理智，有遠識，在建立國更生之際，必能以快慰報善鄰！</p>
<h3>吳鐵城談話</h3>
<p>（上接一版）當九一八日本侵略東北，中國領袖蔣委員長曾吿诉世界，此為第二次世界大戰之序幕，但當時似未能引起美國及其他各國朝野人土之注意。中國為貫澈其反侵略主義，拒絕參加日他義防共協定，致獨自抵抗日本侵略至四年之久，至今猶被美國有識之士指中日戰爭是中國為美國在遠東作戰，當日本侵略海南島，中國領袖又向世界警吿，此為太平洋大戰之序幕，要求美國停止以廢鐵汽油售予日本，並予中國以武器之援助，雖未能使美國人接受中國之意見，但中國依然盡其當盡之責，自一九三七至一九四一年四年之問，獨力抗日，雖海口被封鎖，外援給盡，而抗敵之意志迄未因此少屈。吳氏復稱：國民政府現在之處境，幾與九一八之遭遇柑若，如不能擊敗中國共產黨之武力，足使中國變為國際極權政治之附請，其彤　所及，遠東與世界和平均将受其威脅，於此我願重申前言，國民政府在過去二十年間努力奮鬥之結果，第一，未使中國赤化；第二，未使中國受日本支配，否則整個世界局勢必然故觀，尤其戰後之局而必更險惡於今日。</p>

<p>香港之旅</p>
<p>— 本報特派記者溪居</p>
<p>這次我們中外記者團承英國航空公司招待，得在戰後重遊香港，為時雖僅短短三夜，但却有不少印象，湧上心頭，可為讀者一吿。第一個顯著印象，我覺得，這一座火樹銀花似的被稱為六不　　帝國的皇冠，在夜間從對海九龍瀋望過去，雖屬依舊星燈燦爛，好像一株聖誕樹，可是山頂部份已失落了不小顆數的寶石，看來畢竟褪了　色彩，减了　光輝。這正象徵着今日香港的一切。不過，皇冠雖已褪了色彩，减了光輝，但仍不必為若干人們的樂園。在第二次大戰爆發，之前，香港係依靠避難當事造成了畸形的景氣，而在戰後今日，經濟動盪，時局不靖，又成為走私商人的淘金窟，政治上流亡人物避匿或活動的淵　之地，同時也仍是尋求高度物質享受中外人士予取予求的天堂，在這裏可以盡性享受，飮食不受節約限制，穿着他處所購買不到的華貴衣服……</p>
<p>山頂房屋　空無人影</p>
<p>香港與九龍市區建　物，在戰時日軍未曾狂炸濫轟，原係損失較少，收復後，英人積極修建，到今年春天業經恢復舊觀，記者在戰爭期中所見到的被毁部份，其在市區內者，現在幾巳找不到一　遺跡。這點，我們可以看出英國人的復興能力。但我們遊覽山頂時，所得到印象却又完全不同。遠看山上景物依舊，洋燈巍峨，仍　立於綠業之問，迨一上山頂，只見所有房屋，原來都是殘華空　，幢幢沒有屋頂，窗戶洞開，渝為不見人影的廢墟。山腰之上，原是英人住宅區，（戰前高等華人只能留居山腰一帶。）戰後英國瘡痍深重，人民節衣縮食，而今香港政府世尙在鬧窮，住在島上英國人，遠非昔比，更是無力興修。這次，記者遊至旗桿山時，目擊有三四幢大樓正在大興土本。至於山上道路，一因砲火所毀，二因年久失修，三因　欄，座椅，路燈，鐵柱等等，都被日本人拆運赴日，故已面目全非，景物蕩然。遊客週弔至此，眞是令人感　交集，現在港島政府王在竭力獎勵居民建造　屋，歡迎中國富豪投資住到山上去，凡是能修理此　崇厦巍樓者，滙豐銀行可以貸款協助，其目的則在期求早　恢復昔日繁榮這種養鷄取蛋的辦法，已經收到相當效果。以往上山電車（纜車）遊客擁擠，營業發達，令則每日車廂座客疏落，公司虧本累累。原住山上的港府英人，現今只能與普通華人稅屋同居，因而昔日的「皇家」之氣，巳被掃除不少，對華人另眼相待，較之昔時，逈然不同·</p>
<p>協定簽署　廷未實</p>
<p>看目前香港政府的作風，的確處處以恢復昔日繁榮為前提。在生活方面力求居民的安定，而政策方面也巳此較戰前開明得多，中國報紙可以随便批評香港政府，他們正在冀求洗刷殖民地色彩的外表，取得與華人切實合作。據說：他們希望明年能成止一個華人參政的新機構，來樹立英國在遠東殖民地的新作風。這種政策的改變其與中國人士以前一度提出收回香港之議，雖說不無相當關係，而香港本身之政治與經濟地位，今係與中國吏屬息息相關，欲求香港恢復昔日舊觀，自非與中國切實合作不可。最近數月來張發奎·宋子文·港督葛量洪，英使　諦文之來往報聘，訂立中港協定，這　都是中英雙方積極增進兩國邦交的具體表現。現在中港協定雖經雙方代表止式簽署，成為正式國際文件，而所以遲遲未見實施者，據說，其原因為：　香港乃一無挽口岸，戰後之繁榮，與走私有極大關係：今後如加緊緝私，則私梟之輩可能移跡澳門，對香港大為不利。　中港協定一旦付諸實施，勢將厘訂國幣與港幣的固定匯率，而近來香港申匯慘跌，中國通貨日趨惡性膨脹，如厘訂匯率，不僅港幣將受重大影響，同時目前以香港為中心之僑匯，亦將因此不再流入香港。　自我國實行外匯斬政策後，外匯市價時作調整，但仍趕不上黑市，故出口品多走私香港，但中港協定規定應取締黑市，一旦實行，則出口貿易在滬匯結與在懋匯結相差不多，昔日出口品原運香港轉口者，勢必捨港埠而就他埠，難免不使香港在經濟上蒙受嚴重損失。且香港原為中國進出口貨物的吐納口岸，新協定之實施，可能使這座　爛皇冠因此减光失色·因之政治地位亦難免水為之改觀。英人有此內心苦悶，因此尙未獲得協議。今後香港前途，與前事頗有關係，這也就是使香港政府特別　愼的原因。（下接第五版）</p>

<h3>對未來德國經濟原則　四强意見大相徑庭　蘇堅主先建立德中央機構</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕外長會議今日未能就本屆會議議程第三項，即未來德國之經濟原則，議定處置之方式。最後馬歇爾問莫洛托夫是否能於星期一提出關於經濟原則之具體意見書。莫洛托夫未表同意，祇得宣吿散會。</p>
<p>今日之會由馬歇爾主席，開會後首先建議以英國就經濟原則之基本文件，作爲討論基礎。惟莫洛托夫則欲以莫斯科會議時記錄四强就經濟原則不獲協議諸點之兩文件，作爲討論基礎，當遭其他三外長之反對。在莫洛托夫主張作爲討論某礎之文件中，具有「包括一個或一個以上佔領區之各區經濟機構應予廢止」等語，此項建議如被通過，則英美合併區之組織勢必廢止。莫洛托夫今日並提出三文件，分別關於德工業水準各區物資自由交流及設立德經濟部之意見，然均未被討論。莫洛托夫今日所提文件有云：　「德全國物資自由流通」德中央機構確立，並規定德國履行賠價義務之程序後，應廢止區間壁壘，准許四區物資自由流通，包括一個或一個以上佔領區之各區域經濟機構應即廢止。　「德工業水準」　德中央機構應在新工業水準之限度內，起草善後德國經濟之計劃，惟德國之賠償美務，應責成無條件充分履行。　「中央德國機構」管制國承認有在維護安全，及防止德國軍需工業恢復之　圍內，迅速復興德農工運輸業，提高德人生活水準，使德協助歐洲復興，並發展德對外貿易之必要，惟以德國之經濟復興，有賴於德人民本身之得以在全國執行適當之措施，因此應設立悉由德人組織之中央經濟機構，在四强監管下執行其任務。若中央德國機構之措施，有違盟管會之訓令，佔領區長官得　德中央機構停止其措施之實行，然後由盟管會作最後之決議。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦六日電〕法外長皮杜爾昨夜向四外長會議提出一文件，闡明法政府爲德國經濟基礎所擬訂之三主要原則：　法國堅決主張德國之復原，不應有超過盟國經濟復原之優先權。法國爲符合安全所必需條件起見，希望在德礦產中心地之魯爾，建立特別政府。　賠償問題與安全問題不可分離，法國認爲吾人可將德國非急需之大量機器與設備，分配予曾受戰爭蹂躪之盟國，以限制德工業潛能。　德國務須儘速使其不致繼續成爲佔領國之負擔，幷務須以其資源平衡其國際收支。法國不反對德國爲單一經濟體，即魯爾與萊因區亦無例外，惟法國一向認爲薩爾係搆成法經濟與貨幣領域完整之一部份。</p>
<h3>蘇用心昭然若揭　目的破壞英美區經濟組織並使德無法參加歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕莫洛托夫之不欲使德國與西方强國樹立任何方式之經濟合夥，今已公然提出，莫洛托夫關於德國經濟原則之建議，僅涉一般原則，而英美法三外長則欲莫洛托夫提出關於具體問題之意見。莫洛托夫之目的，不外下列兩端；　有計劃的破壞德境英美區之經濟組織；　使德國無從全部或一部參加馬歇爾援歐方案。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫建議以德國支付蘇聯所要求之賠償額及德境四區物資之自由交流，易取各區經濟機構之廢止。此外莫洛托未並主張立即建立德中央行政機稱。以爲建立德國中央政府之準備，俟此二政府不論其是否臨時性質成立以後，莫洛托夫即準備建立德國中央機構，然其特定之形式及性質，迄尙未由莫氏明白提出。蘇聯之意，乃爲依照蘇聯所願意的方式，使經濟權力迅速集中於德人之手，但同時則允許各區司令在其管區內，握有擬具經濟制度之廣大權力，後者可以防止德中央機構權利之過於擴大，或防止德國之經濟不依照蘇聯所通過之方式而發展。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕共和黨衆議員，衆院海商委員會主席威契爾，今日向記者發表談話，主張必要時對蘇停止一切輸出以斷絕對該以主要敵國之供應。衆院海商委員會，話在調査蘇聯便用美國所造船舶之事。危氏謂：根據輸出管制法，杜魯門總統今仍有權限制對蘇輸出，惟總統似尙不欲充分利用比一權力耳，就　所知，農　及機械仍大量自美輸山蘇聯，茍不立即予以停止，　將要求海商委員會通過立法案，禁止任何船舶自美國海口載運物資前往蘇聯或蘇聯統治之國。</p>

<h3>市參議員參觀吳淞煤氣廠　產量日增經濟拮据　擬具計劃明年擴充</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市吳縣煤氣廠，係三十四年接收敵產改組成立，直隸於公用局。接收初期，廠內各工塲建築均千孔百瘡，經廠內員工分別鳩工修復，於翌年元旦起，正式恢復供應，兩年來成績良好，迄今每日產量已這八十萬立方英尺。該廠爲應市參議會公用小組負責人之建議，特於昨日上午十時，邀請市參議員汪竹一，何元明，姜豪，瞿鉞，王子揚，李文杰，王劍鍔等，赴吳淞該廠參觀煤氣生產情形，公用局副局長張仁滔並陪同前往。據該廠廠長許寳駿報吿其業務進展情形，略稱：最初煤氣供應範圍侷處於市中心區一隅，用戶稀少，推進困難。後因英商上海煤氣公司產量不敷供應，即由該廠饋氣。初每日不過十萬立方英尺，嗣增至四十五萬立方公尺。吳淞煤氣廠雖誕生僅八九年，然欲與有七八十年歷史之上海煤氣公司在營業上有所競爭，事實上非不可能，徒以</p>
<p>經濟困難</p>
<p>未得充分發展•因該廠機　設備，當年日人均東凑西集，减工省料，復經轟炸震動，損壞更多，如不即予修整，使用壽命勢必减少。現該廠已擬具明年度擴充計劃：　增建機械發生爐，俾求產量之增加。業向美國訂購，明年年底可運到。約合國幣廿五億元。　增建柏油分離器，業向英國定購，明年年底可到，約合國幣三億元。　添製八吋高壓管，俾氣量增加後，可直接送達上海煤氣公司儲氣池，已向救濟總署申請配售，預計約需國幣三十億元。　添鑾五百呎深井一口，約共需國幣十億元。據張副局長表示，市府對該廠迄今</p>
<p>投資總額</p>
<p>爲十億元，當時向敵偽產業處購買機器即需六億元，微用地皮三億元，故經濟情形十分困難，一如天天過年關，故欲求業務之發展，經濟上須予助力。昨日各參議員參觀後，一致認爲其前途極有希望，瞿鉞並稱：希望將來上海人都有煤氣用，盼吳淞煤氣廠同人能爲全體市民謀福利。</p>

<p>林風眠繪畫思想蘊藏着文藝復興</p>
<p>在林風眠卅年的繪畫生涯中，這十年的沉默是有特殊意義的。這十年中，他從未開過一次畫展。當許多時髦畫家異常活躍時，他却一直沉默着，像古代先知，在沙漠裏默默找他的眞理，他的不朽畫面畫格畫調，經過這十年絕對鬥爭，現在，他終於把他在沙漠上的豐盛收穫第一次放在我們面前。</p>
<p>明淸以來，近幾百年，由於理學風行，中國思想界一直强調着理性，而壓抑本能（所謂張天理，節人慾），絕對禁慾色彩的枯乾道學氣瀰漫了中國文化，不讓活潑潑的本能情感抬頭，這種摧殘基本人性的思想傾向，反映在繪畫上，便是文人畫的盛行，以及神秘理境的追求。於是盡以空憲靜穆為主，人間烟火味越少越好。</p>
<p>中國文藝復興的基本特點，必然是</p>
<p>「人」的重新發現，「人」性重新抬頭。中國現代美術復興的剌激素，一方面固然是希臘及漢唐古典藝術，一方面更重要的，却是西洋文藝術復興以後的全部美術。只有文藝復興以來的西方人文思想，才能拯救近幾百年來中國美術的空虛乾枯。畫中非烟火的部分，必須以烟火為基礎，才能完成。必須以蓬勃的肉為起點，才能完成最後的靈幻。必須以大自然及人性的實在存在為泉源，才能達到眞正的超脫與空虛。在這裏，林風眠是中國現代第一個人，大胆接受了西方近代的全部人文思想，以這個為基礎，再用一副全新的眠睛來看東方，選擇東方，而終於又回到東方。</p>
<p>看出一個新的時代</p>
<p>看林風眠畫，必須穿透它優美的外形，直入優美的後面，捕捉那深邃的核心思想與核心情緒。他的重點，顯然不是在純粹形式美的追求上，而是正圖建立一個嶄新的明日文化信仰，明日生命民哲學，以及作為這二者主要基礎的「明日感覺」。正因為此，看某些裝飾性的唯美作品，初初接觸，却越看越覺脆弱。這些美是不經久的。林風眠畫的形式美，是有一大套深邃的生命思想做底子的，所以它們是結實的，耐久的，越看越耐嚼的。他的畫不只是畫，而是時代預言。在他的畫裏，我們可以看出一個新的時代，一種新的人性，一種新的文化精劉，而更重要的是：作為上述三者總和基礎的嶄新的感覺「明日感覺」。假如說，文藝復興巨匠們的畫，曾先期預言了近幾百年歐洲文化精神的傾向，那麼林風眠的那些女像，雖然它們現在還在不斷拼命嘗試與發展中，已多多少少開始畫出了今後中國文藝復興（也就是世界文藝復興的開始）的精神面貌。林風眠畫（主要是女像），却給我們帶來希望，光亮，與樂觀。在中國畫史上，林風眠畫所以能佔一獨特高峯，其意義在此。假如他的畫只是一種造形的革命，那只是時代的一個支流，而絕不會這樣成為時代主渡。</p>
<p>綫條方面獨特成就</p>
<p>林風眠在綫條方面的成就，幾乎是空前的。在他以前，國畫家從沒有這樣大膽改造綫條。近數百年來，畫家專在傳統成規中兜圈子，不像古人那樣直接深人自然，觀察自然，綫條雖欲模枋古人的空靈神渺，但因缺少由深入自然，而喚起的基本生命感，結果却越來越空虛脆弱，不是成為古畫的不完全的複本，便是成為不完全的復本的複本。這些脆弱薄僵死的綫條，由於林風眠幾十年的苦工與鬥爭，第一次被改造了，復活了，充實了，恢復了一千年前的規模和生氣。他的綫條所以那樣獨特，正因為他吸收了油彩的精萃。他是當代第一個人，把西方油彩的味道溶化到中國水墨里，所以他的綫條才那樣又嫵媚，又結實，又神　，又豐厚。</p>
<p>林風眠的女像畫面那種瓷器式的精緻，和諧，與靈巧，不僅是他受宋瓷影響的結果，顯然也是極度靈感的結晶。由於宣紙的特强吸墨性，和水墨的易乾性，這些畫必須畫得極快。畫家必須經過强度的忍耐，凝造出高度的激情，在白熱的精神壯態下，憑他對綫條色彩的熟練經驗，閃電式的把最高度精神火花捕促到紙上。作這些畫時，一筆都不能出毛病，（油畫是堆砌的）。看那結女像時，我常有黑夜觀閃電感，特別是那些水墨多彩色少的女像，暗的衣衫襯出極明亮的臉，給人以閃電式的明亮感，以及高度愉快感，恬淡感，美感和智慧感，在賽尙納的風景畫上，由於那些斧劈式的易性的綫條，和奇妙的組合，也亮着同樣的閃電，一種和諧的明凈感和智慧感。</p>
<p>三十年來刻意精求</p>
<p>無擬的，美術史上最高峯的作品，總是感情理智極度平衡後的結昌，只有這種作品，才又精緻，又結實，又靈幻，又健康，是靈與肉的和諧結合。林風眠却是經過卅年苦工的刻意追求，才終於開始獲得的。他正在拼命加强它，發展它，使安更明凈，更豐富，更結實，更成熟。</p>
<p>林風眠努力追求希臘美思想工具有兩個，一個是西方文藝復興的人文主義，一個是　方老　的自然主　，他的畫面精神，顯然是這兩種不同思想的溶合，而這種溶合後所表現的藝術精神，不只是象徵着未來新繪畫的精神，同樣也象徵着東西二大文化溶和後的新興世界文化的基本精神。林風眠經過卅多年的鬥爭，過去卅年的鬥爭，是完了，這應該只是他另一個卅年鬥爭的凖備。在這個新卅年鬥爭中，我們希望他從眞理宮殿最深處搶出那最永恒的不朽眞理，扔到他的畫面上，不僅讓中國藝術界開開眼界，更重要的是，　世界藝術界也開開眼界。（一記者）</p>

<h3>茂昌公司經理談茂昌的眼鏡</h3>
<p>不久以前，打從美國醫學界傳來個消息，說美國眼科醫生可以治好失明多年的瞽者，重見光明。日前接到遠方一位失明的長者來信，要求爲他在滬上探聽這個消息的確實性。由於這樣一個動機，昨天記者特地訪問了驗光專家張德乾茂昌眼鏡公司的副經理。</p>
<p>他的回答，頗足以使我那位遠方的瞽親失望。因爲就現在所知美國醫界眼科的情形，他說：「美國及其他各國，今天還沒有人研究出能使一個盲者可以完全恢復光明的方法」。接着他說：「就是近視眼到現在也還沒有方法可以治好」。因為眼球的　膜，是由緊密的　維組織所構成，眼鏡一患近視，　膜組總就吿軟化延長變薄，如想使　　地位仍回到射入光綫所結成的焦點上，是　不可能的事。所幸近視雖不可治，却可設法阻滯其加深的速度。這些方法，除了改善學校衛生，普及光學常識之外，就是佩戴準光眼睛，均足爲減輕近視痛苦之一助。佩戴準光眼鏡是否有效阻　近視的速度，他說：凡是有經驗者，都信此說不誤。</p>
<p>他領記者參觀樓上的製造部，幾千位工友都埋頭忙著配置，小至刨光的紅粉，磨光的灰砂，鏡片，鏡架，幾乎全是　來品。舶萊品需要外匯，今天結匯的困難情形，人所盡知。因此他們的原料進口成了大問題。船隻交通上的阻　，使他們去年在美國的訂貨，到現在還未運到上海。資金凍結了，業務發展間接受到阻碍。胡賡佩總經理說：茂昌的牌號MC，在南美洲，新加坡，東印度，　羅各國的「眼鏡階級」，是很馳名的。也就是說，他們的業務　出品的精製程度，可以與美國抗衡而遙居在遠東各國之上。美國幾家有名的眼鏡公司AO，白雪龍，培司丹，COC，馬丁，羅傑司脫，在中國都是茂昌特約或獨家經營的。因爲原料不易進口，出口受影響，國外的市塲，現在看着給人家奪去了。</p>
<p>說起他們的刻在鏡片旁，細微得不易看見MC牌號，倒有件趣味的故事。去年，一位軍人從桂林到上海來，說他在桂林時，茂昌分公司給他配製的近視鏡，驗錯了光度，要求重予騐光另配。他們吿訴軍人，除了在上海的總公司之外，只有南京一家分公司，桂林的「茂昌」眼鏡公司是冒牌的。檢騐鏡片旁，果沒有MC牌號。但他們仍爲這位軍人免費騐光，另配了一付。</p>
<p>戰前，潘公展氏担任本市敎育局長時，鑒於學生因目光不良，影響學業，商由該公司爲全市大中小學學生免費騐光，並且爲特價義務代配眼鏡。戰後，經衛生敎育家周尙的鼓勵，該公司仍舊以每副五萬元的代價，爲學生配製眼鏡。爲維持最低的成本，最近才漲到每副八萬元。說到他們免費爲顧客臉光，頗招到同業不滿。據說，有幾家公司的驗光費高達百萬元，這在他們認爲是失了理性的苛索。爲社會服務，爲供應普遍的需要，他們首先決定免費驗光。在價格上也祇維持最低的利潤。</p>
<h3>漁市場昨已復業</h3>

<h3>全國郵工代表大會昨開提案審查會議</h3>
<p>全國郵工代表大會，昨在武昌路上海郵務工會及吳淞路郵局，分別舉行各組提案審査委員會議。各組辯論要點：　待遇組A，服裝配備方面，希望局方每人發給制服，並配合當地情形，外勒人員制服數量應較內勤增加一倍，B，米貼方面，差工米代金與職員相同，直系親屬五人以上者，每人加二斗。C·待遇方面，各級人員比較之等級，不能相差過份，應保持三與四之比例。津貼補助方面，根據過去數字，按照生活指數計算。　會議組，總會改名「中華民國郵工全國聯合會」，內部組織將設組織，宣傳，總務，福利，硏究等五組。並設會計室，視察室，郵工遝動，設計委員及婦運委員會等各項。　年終指數組，負責硏究生活指數及年獎問題。　福利組·供給員工宿舍，（按郵局宿舍僅郵政總局及各地郵政儲金匯業局有是項設置）。在宿舍未能解決以前，應發給房租津貼。　局務人事組，改善各級員工積資升級等辦法，並恢復長期假等。各組審査提案人員於昨日漏夜辦公，定今日上午將全部提案審査完竣，下午休會。</p>

<h3>不肖生返肥　對本報記者談　脫險與創作</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥六日訊〕抗戰中，在大別山二十一集團軍總部，充少將秘書，以著「江湖奇俠傳」，「留東外史」得名的小說家，平江不肖生向愷然，在九月二日，匪陷立煌後被俘，消息傳來，文化界爲之揑了以把汗。茲向氏業已脫險到肥，皈依於城內東大街，皖中唯一古刹的明敎寺，連日文化界造訪者頗衆·向氏鬚白頂禿，精神矍鑠、娓娓談其彼俘經過，成爲海內文化界所樂聞。特記如下：</p>
<p>響山寺內被俘囚</p>
<p>向氏自勝利後，因醉心印度佛學，淡於名利，堅決的亂去了軍職，靜心硏討，並撰一長篇，取材於自淸初至今，上下三百餘年之史料，預算可得二百萬字，標題爲「革命野史」，以補正史之不足。常時省府，爲了紀念開山的前主席廖燕農（係）將軍，及爲國犧牲的諸將士，決定了在大別山根擠地點女煌，建築廖公祠，昭忠祠，勝利紀念塔，請向氏留山督修，此三大工程，向氏義不容辭，留寓廖公墓前面的響山寺，木料工程未竣，九月二日，霹靂一聲，匪軍竄陷立煌，三日，向氏即被匪軍俘至十里外古碑冲的司令部中，作階下囚了。</p>
<p>古碑沖頭答審訊</p>
<p>第二日，由所謂行政部長史子榮等審訊姓名，向氏直陳不諱，史等乃肅然起敬，閒曾否研讀毛澤東，郭沫若，魯迅等書籍？答：書未讀唐宋以下。問對共軍作何感想？答：未得政權，即濫用政策，徒招恨人民，且攻踞貧瘠如　的立煌固守，將來不凍死，亦要餓死，說得史等默然良久。嗣問你願不願到佳木斯當敎官？答：我根本就未看馬克斯一類的書籍，倘敎我拿手好戲的老子，莊子，四書，五經，恐怕不合味口。</p>
<p>明敎寺中寫野史</p>
<p>匪等知不可屈，軟禁了向氏八天，將其衣物書籍等搜括一空，對向氏說：本於不殺賢者之義，可以請便吧。向氏乃脫虎口返寺，在四　　然中，撿獲其數年心血結晶的「黨命野史」殘缺不完的文稿，經月餘的整理補充，某夜，在月黑風高時，穿了一襲灰棉袍，涉水登山，離開了紅色的恐怖圈，輾　到了省會的合肥。據向氏談：每日在香烟繚繞中，尙續寫八千字未究的「革命野史」，一俟吿成出版，就竹　芒鞋，遄返其湖南平江可愛的故鄉。</p>

<h3>香港會變成「東方雷諾」嗎？「上海小姐」披頭散髮鬧婚變</h3>
<p>〔本　香港四日航訊〕「小姐」在香港，這年頭，似乎總是種着　運，惹是生非。上海小如謝家驊，別的地方不制，　　到香港來，又在這裏上演比電影還要迫眞還要熱鬧的戲。謝小姐是應了大中英影片公司的約，來香港拍戲的，報上這樣載，人們的嘴上也如此說，怎曉得她却是借此機會離開了他的丈夫！</p>
<p>昨日，她的丈夫榮梅莘由上海趕到香港，謝小姐親往機塲迎接！兩人同軍渡海到山明水秀的淺水灣酒店去。在那裏，兩人打起架來，給酒店當局「下逐客令」，小姐於是披頭散髮，一路哭哭啼啼奔向對岸九龍的大中華宿舍去。聽說謝小姐已去電上海叫她的母親來港，決心和榮梅華辦離婚。香港人給榮梅華加上一個「顏料大王」的名號，和謝家驊的「上海小姐」相對，這個故事　好熱鬧的香港有閒階級展開一個新塲面。</p>
<p>記得不久以前，楊秀瓊也是老遠由上海跑回香港來正式辦理離婚手續的，恰巧和「香港小姐」吳丹鳳正式離婚同一個日子！聽說和榮大王同時來港的，還有一個上海律師余祥　——再過一個時間，這個南國的小島很可能變爲「東方的雷諾城」了！（時約記者子健）</p>

<p>（上文接第二版）在這中港交接頻繁聲中，還有一件勒遷九龍城居民問題，也是大家所注目的事。記者抵港前後，正在鬧得滿城風雨，各報均熱烈刋載此訊。事緣香港政府工務局於上月廿七日通吿二千餘居民限於二週內移出，他們的理由是以港府所頒佈的公地權限法規根據，說依據該項規定，工務局有權下令在此地上搭蓋民居或任何建築物者遷讓，否則港府有權強令其遷出，並將該項建築物拆毀，而中國政府方面認爲問題的中心是在九龍城的管治主權問題。査港府要該城居民搬遷，這回已是第三次·在一九三三年夏季也曾鬧過一次，但因該城區域渺小，人口稀疏，平時粤省未能設官治理，而香港當局也因中英條約關係，後來未予執行。現在，外交部特派員郭德華已爲此事入京請示，並開始向港府提出交涉，同時粵省議會亦起而討論聲援及交涉辦法。記者這次在港，與中國居民說起此案，大家對此都極注意，主張政府應該據理力爭。八年的抗戰已使香港中國居民對政治觀念提高不少，不復是昔日不聞不問的態度，這點倒是値得珍貴，也是値得重視的。</p>
<p>走私淘金各逞其能</p>
<p>就記者此行見聞所及，覺得走私問題至今仍極嚴重。港島各店存貨山積，顧客擁擠，其熱鬧情形，較之戰前，毫無遜色。德輔道及　后大道上最多的爲出售衣料百貨等等的洋貨店，店內花色繁多，美不勝收，有許多物品，英美也許無法買到，但在香港却是遍地皆是。呢絨，羊毛，織物等衣料價　物美。上等女色呢絨，出廿五元港幣，可以買到比上海一百三四十萬的還要好得多。羊毛背心售價十餘元起至廿元。高等的尼能絲襪售七元至十一元港幣。化粧品之類，也是便宜得很，這難怪走私商人要把香港視爲淘金之窟。此外，鐘換店及出售自來水筆的，更是到處皆是。其價格。約比上海便宜二分之一或三分之一，滿街在走的以及在商店中間價的，大半都是各地辦貨的旅客。我親眼看見一個中等婦人，向一個錶店購買了六七隻價値幾千萬的手錶，一面與同坐友人談論上海錶價，顯然是買了去預備做生意的。路上的攤販以及茶室中的侍役，寫字時抽出口袋來的，都是耀人眼目的派克之類的五一型自來水筆。這幾天，耶穌聖誕將到，各家商店都已打燈結彩，向顧客大獻慇勤，請香烟，送贈品，希望多拉一點生意。不過，在我逛街之間，我却發覺有一樣値得注意的事，現就是任何一種美國貨物，並沒有比上海便宜多少。於是我問起一位老香港，他回答說：「這是英國人的看家本領啊！美國貨上棧後，出棧總是困難重重，而且有時還得規定限價後方許出買……」這才使我明白了內幕。此外，外間盛傳日貨暢銷香港的話，我也得到了一個否定的答覆。因爲，至少在我逛街時，還不曾看到日本的商品過。</p>
<p>賺得容易化得闊綽</p>
<p>說到一般居民的生活，因</p>
<p>香港旗桿山上，有屋無人，熱鬧地區，却又有人無屋，這個現象，顯出了一種強烈的對照！（本報特派記者溪居攝寄）爲幣制穩定，物價波動較少，似乎都還過得安定。每個人都穿得相當整潔，走起路來沒有像上海人這般爭生存的緊張狀態·廣東茶室中整日坐滿了飲茶客。高等的大酒樓，女招待依然打扮得花枝招展噼拍打麻將之聲，通街可以聞到。我問過一位女侍，問她每月有多少收入，她的回答是八百元到一千元光景，我又問過一位男侍，他說也可月得四百元左右。不過，這些高等食客中，廣東人與香港人較少，而大都却是「賺得容易化得闊綽」的上海辦貨客人。記者在港先後留居四日，而我們却天天在爲食宿問題發愁，因爲飲食一事，實在貴得驚人，幾乎比上海高出十倍，有一位記者科一小碗蝦球炒飯，會鈔港幣近四元，我們三個記者上一次建國酒家，祗吃客飯式的三菜一湯，付賬時是港幣三十餘元，約合國幣一百萬元光景。旅館也貴，每天約需港幣三十元，這，也便是一般旅客所謂「長安雖好，不能久居」的原因。</p>
<p>交通頻繁吐痰罰鍰</p>
<p>交通方面，香港已成空運中心，在半島酒店左邊樓下的各國航空公司，就有十一二家之多。進出輪船每日都有這些情形，要此昔日戰時更爲方便，而香港的繁榮，也即餽築在交通基礎之上。講到市內交通，仍如昔日辦得一樣井井有條，街車起價一元五毫，公共汽車不論遠近三毫，電車頭等二毫，三等一毫，輪渡頭等二毫，三等一毫。交通以外的一般市政，似乎要比已往更爲進步。居民以港府執法較嚴，英人又能以身作則，所以也能處處守法。無論乘軍行路，都不如上海緊張混亂。最近香港政府因爲港島潮濕，肺結核病猖獗，特定一律禁止居民隨地吐痰，違者處罰廿五元至一百元港幣，現在路上行人，無不小心遵守，漸已造成習慣。此外，又如物價問題，一經政府規定，不得自行抬高，否則即行處罰。記者在港時見他們購買公價物品，雙方均能切實遵守。不如我們國內商人屯積居奇，物價一日波動數次．至於港府所發港幣，更是大家信用，絕無通貨膨脹現象，這些種種，可以看出英人治事能力，値得我們借鏡。</p>

<h3>挽救糖荒的一支生力軍　台糖公司努力生產　五年後可望恢復一百萬噸產量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在接收的敵產中，二年來經營得相當有成績的，除了中國紡建公司外，資委會的台灣糖業公司，抱負也着實不小。在世界普遍鬧糖荒的今天，把台糖列爲國寳之一，該不是件誇張的事。</p>
<p>三十五年初，台灣全島共有近代化的糖廠四十二所。在日人手裏接收過來的時候，不是曾受空襲損毀，就是遭人爲的疏於保養而廢燜了。鐵軌·道釘。車輪·滑潤油·樣樣沒來源，鐵路制度顯得極度的頹唐。糧食利厚，農民捨蔗而種糧，肥料短絀等等一切景象，職顯得支離破碎。台糖看樣子只有全盤瓦解的份兒，日人冷眼瞧着你沒法利用！</p>
<p>美方貸款批准有望</p>
<p>今天，台糖却並走入沒落的途徑。祖國派去接管和復興台糖的幹員，歷盡艱苦，排除萬難，和美國的技師們，給台糖奠下一塊五年復興計劃的基石。憑這塊基石，台糖將竿頭日上，五年後的台糖，就可恢復到它全盛時代年產一百萬噸的雄姿。</p>
<p>這不是一個紙上談兵的空計劃，而是經過許多中外製糖技師和專家，多番實地調査硏究，絞盡腦汁後產生的結晶品。第一次硏究結果，由美籍製糖工業工程師羅士E．A．Rose。擬了一個五年計調，全部計劃所需經費要美金三千萬元，這計劃後來因故擱淺，就有第二個五年計劃出現，需經費美金二千萬元，給美國推出口銀行看過，覺得相當切實，認爲台糖是一個有希服的工業，所以傳說在一二個月內，就有考慮批傳的可能。</p>
<p>五年預算產糖估計</p>
<p>照這個計劃預算，五年間台糖的進境，可從下面的統計數字裏看出來：年度　　產面積　產糖總額單位百英畝單位千噸卅五—卅六七八九三四卅六—卅七二一〇三二五卅七—卅八二八一五五八〇卅八—卅九三九五〇九〇七卅九—四〇、四三二〇一一〇〇糖季年度的推算，通常是從筑一年的十二月起，到第二年五月爲止，這也是一年中的榨糖季節。而從一技蔗下種到收穫爲止，前後整整需十八個月。由這裏，不難想像到，已經過去的一年—也是台灣處境最艱窘的一年—那三萬四千噸的台糖產量，是化費了多少心血給換來的！</p>
<p>今年的產量，照預定的計劃是三十二萬五千噸。從本年一切的跡象看來，這個預計的產額，是可以全部兌現的。試看幾個兌現的因子：　今年颱風很溫和，產田沒受打擊。　中國銀行美金借款五百萬元，使台糖能向外購置本年所需的機器鐵路等各項器材，加速完成修復工程。　國內製糖工業專家，十之七八，都爲資委會羅致，參加台糖。　台灣省政府當局和台灣銀行的特別借款，解決了台糖在當地添購器材的問題。　肥料間題，今年已設法張羅到了二萬八千噸。這些因子，給風打雨吹中的台糖，拋下了一個安定錨。</p>
<p>鼓動蔗農增加生產</p>
<p>但是，問題還不是全沒有。在種糧利厚的環境下，去年合糖打了個換糖法的主意，才把蔗農內興趣挽回來。這主意是把蔗農手裏收來的甘蔗。榨了糖，蔗農得百分之四八，台糖得百分之五二。按常時糖價，拆現給蔗農。同時，在下種時又貸給蔗苗肥料等。辦理結果，去年終算在絕望中，挽回了三萬多噸台糖。今年再接再厲，爲了增加蔗農興趣，分糖比例，決定改爲各得半數。照大數產糖卅萬噸計算，半數折現付給蔗農，就需台幣二百五十億元，合法幣在三萬億元之譜。這款子現在趕緊得籌集，準備明年一月到四月間分發。目前台灣銀行發行已足額，所以聽說台糖正跟中央銀行折個中。爲了台糖的前途，中央銀行當然會想出個總曼妙計的。</p>
<p>台糖外銷成績一斑</p>
<p>在世界普遍鬧糖荒的今天，台糖的外銷，無疑處處將受人垂靑。問題就看我們是否願意供應，與供應多少而己。卅五到卅六年，台糖曾作處女外銷，前後不到三千噸。銷得最多的，是新加坡和香港，連砂糖產地爪哇，也輸入台糖，每噸給價高到英金一百廿五鎊，寗非奇跡。卅六到卅七年度的外銷計劃，預定輸出十萬噸·這數額日本和印度約佔了百分之五十，其餘的將分銷到近東·馬來亞·曼谷·各地。目前食糖的世界價格，大致在美金二百五十元左右。台糖替我們掙回的外匯是可觀的。讓我們祈禱，復興台糖的美國貸款，早日批准，甜蜜蜜的台糖，祖國需要你，世界也需要你！</p>
<h3>中蠶公司邀集有關各方　商討明年蠶桑事業　製種桑苗組已獲初步決定</h3>
<p>中國蠶絲公司年來輔導蠶絲事業之改進，不遺餘力。對於桑苗蠶種絲繭等增產，頗具成效。該公司爲計劃明年度全國蠶桑事業計，特於上月二十四日起，邀請江浙兩省建設長官及有關人士，舉行小組會議。共同商討，以期集思廣益，交換意見。截至上週杪止，關於製種及桑苗兩組，已獲得初步決定。其餘如絲織金融，輔導及產銷諸組，仍繼續商討中·茲誌第一第二兩組，商討結果如次：</p>

<h3>美十年科學研究計劃</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>——看看人家，想想自己——</p>
<p>在過去，美國是吸收着歐洲傅給她的科學理論的，今天，她已經要自己在理論科學上有所建樹了。她必須要從事大規模的科學研究，才能滿足那些着急的工程師們。飛機的飛連已經超過了　連，但到現在還沒有一套完整的理論來解釋和如何去避免危險。同時，原子能的應用更需要在理論上有新發現。過去，美國多是利用別人的理論去發明許多超越的東西。前此兩個德國科學家借助了意大利人的研究才發現原子核能分裂的理論，因而啟示了美國人去發明原子彈。可是今天美國要依靠勞人已非其時了。針對着這個現實，美國的一羣科學研究者，包括軍事的和非軍事的，在一位總統的科學顧問指導下，作了詳盡而廣泛的討論後，向白宮提出了一個科學研究十年計劃的報告。她們一致認為除非美國埋頭苦幹十年，在圈圈民上是不會的　人的建樹的。在這個十年計劃中，關於研究的內容和方針，都有很詳細的提示。</p>
<p>探求　知</p>
<p>在將來　研究中這是第一個目標。無論從政府或私人　　的經費中，百分之九十要用到作新理論的研究，另外百分之十用到已有基　的理論研究。而且在基本科學研究上要有四倍於今天研究的經費。以後在軍事武器研究上花費的金額需要減少，以便用到其他急需的部門。預計在一九五七年時，基本科學研究可佔全部經費的百分之二十；屬於軍事的僅佔百分之四十。其他部分由聯邦財政部供給去從事研究，至於工業方面所供給的研究經費多偏重在實用上，純理論的研究除了政府機關加倍去努力外，還有學院也從事這方面的探求。</p>
<p>醫藥研究</p>
<p>現在美國每年花費在藥醫和公共衛生的研究上衹有二千八百萬美金，將來到一九五七年時就得要耗去三億美金去從事醫藥和衛生的研究。</p>
<p>一九四七年美國花費在科學研究上是空前的，除過秘而不　的原子能研究費外，有十一億六千萬美金之多，這恰等一九三〇年的十倍，戰時每年平均的二倍。但據這計劃來看，在一九五七年就得要二十二億美金，初看起來嚇人，其實這不過佔全國總政入的百分之一；有許多私人公司曾耗費到全年收入的百分之二去從事新產品的研究，有些甚至用到百分之五六的。</p>
<p>訓練人才</p>
<p>第一步先要大批訓練的科學工作者。目前科學家之缺少是相當的嚴重，多少政府部門關於科學方面的職位是空着的。軍方研究彈道和放射的人員迄今尚需要現有人數的四分之一；而原子能委員會找不到很多適當的科學家，海軍和分共衛生方面許多急待進行的研究因無人而沒法開始。</p>
<p>原因很簡單，從一九四〇年到一九四七年科學研究經費已增加上原來的百分之三百三十五，而科學工作者僅增加了百分之三十五。實在，美國假使沒有戰爭，她可以培養出九萬多個科學學士和五千個科學博士的。在這個人才缺少中更嚴重的是大學　科學指導的不敷　用，學生比戰時增加了二倍多，而教師僅增加了百分之三十；照目前趨勢看，至少要增加一萬五千多位講師才行。因之這人才知少的缺憾，要到一九五二年才能消除，預計今天的大學一年級學生那時都可直接參加工作了。</p>
<p>通盤計劃</p>
<p>由政府直接通盤計劃科學研究工作在美國是第一次，將要下令四十一個聯邦研究局同時從事不同的工作，這樣不會有重復和遺漏。過去，美國的海軍和陸軍就犯了無通　計劃和統一指導的錯誤，現在可以來集中起來分工合作了。</p>
<p>另外重要的設施，是將現在這些像樣的試驗室擴大而且充實起來。計劃中需要一億五千萬美金來裝備一些大學的實驗室。</p>
<p>把國外的科學智識給美國國內輸送也是一件重要的工作。在派駐各國使館內，就設有科學家情報站，他們得經常報告那一國一切科學的活動，就好像現在報告商業新聞一樣。目前英國和荷蘭在美國就設有這種機構；而特別重要的要把蘇聯一切重要科學論著都能即時翻譯到美國國內來，以便交換新的智識。</p>
<p>這個計劃應是美國在今後十年中最低限度的努力，其他的國家早就秘密地計劃着科學的研究了。蘇聯在一九四七年花費在研究上的，也有一億二千萬美金之多，而他們要在五年計劃完成時有七十萬工程師和科學家在從事工作，那時美國也許僅有六十萬正在上大學的學生呢。許多國家都在朝這個方向走，英國計劃每年要有雙倍於前一年的科學家產生；比利時已使其研究經費增加到二倍；印度正埋頭建造新的試騐室和培養科學家來從事她出產最　當的　——原子彈原料的混全物——的研究。基於這些事實和理由，美國政府不能不立即領導全美國的科學家去探求更偉大而廣泛的新智識了。</p>
<h3>蝙蝠的雷達</h3>
<p>— 友仃</p>
<p>蝙蝠在夜間飛行，疾進而能不撞碰其途中的障碍物，這一問題久為生物學家甚或物理學家們所不解的。有許多科學家為要了解這一疑難，曾捕捉了許多蝙蝠來作試驗。結果發現在室內飛行的蝙蝠，不但能避開牆壁家具，而且能避開蜘蛛網；起初甚為不解，後來發覺某種　於其聽覺的干擾，可能使其飛行淩亂而不能清晰為舊地避開障碍物。</p>
<p>一九二〇年，哈出奇（Ha-rtridge）教授始謂當蝙蝠飛翔於黑暗之夜時，可能係由於蝙蝠自身出一種超高速音波（Super-somc　Souncs）而反射至其耳內，然後得以確定障碍物之地位。二十年後，雷達及水中採訊器宋納（Sonar）相　發明，此　更見明確，因為這兩樣東西在理論與原則上與蝙蝠之前述作用相同，惟蝙蝠所放出者非電磁波或尋常的聲波而已。它所放射的超高速音波之頻率範圍為每秒二萬五千至七萬次顫動，而常人所能聽到的音波，其頻率只有第秒十六次或至三千次顫動，所以蝙蝠所發的音波，實則已超過人類所覺之極限。</p>
<p>這種說法，確有其試驗的根據。曾有兩學者把捉來的蝙蝠一一試驗，將其嘴及鼻掩住，只剩下兩耳，除去　　，仍能飛行如舊。然後又更進一步利用一種電子機器高　分析器，輔助實行實驗。這個分析機之重要部分為一　　音器，對於超高速音波極其敏感，另有一擴大器，可使音波之頻率由高變低，因之分析器可以　度任何由其收受之高速音波。利用這種機器，結果發現蝙蝠幾乎無時不在放射超高速音波。其頻率當然時有變化，但多半約在每秒顫動五萬次左右。在這種調節之下，每一嘶呌之聲只延續二百分之一秒之久；已經由證明而知蝙蝠在休息時約每秒嘶呌為十次，但振翅而飛時則增至每秒三十次。當接近一障碍物時，其嘶呌猛然增至每秒五十甚至六十次，但當障碍已過時，則其次數立刻降低至正當情况；嘶呌聲之『率』　然隨其與物件之距離而變更。因為要計算出物件返回之間聲的時間之故。</p>
<p>除去不能為人耳所聽見之超高速之外，蝙蝠還能放出另外的三種聲音，計有：　飛行時所載的一種尋常的聲音，哈出奇把它呌作當號音；　一種　　　聲，若當　其接近時，人耳可以聽見；　一種的答聲，常可在數呎距離內聽見。這當『信　音』隨蝙蝠種屬而異，營營聲及的答聲則為超高速音波之　　物，但『信號音』亦有與超高速音波相伴而生者。這四種音究竟如何發生，雖然未知其詳，但由於其喉頭之觀察研究，可知其與一般動物所有者迥然不同，動物之喉頭大多為軟骨質者，但蝙蝠之喉頭却是硬骨的，同時有一塊巨大的强壮肌肉。由蝙蝠的喉頭之强硬及其形狀之小，可知其極為適於發生超高速音波。</p>
<p>雖然不知道超高速音波究竟如何產生，但却得知蝙蝠如何避免聽到自己的嘶聲而只收物件的回聲；蝙蝠耳內通常有一塊肌肉，嘶聲一發，肌肉即行收縮，設法使嘶聲被摒棄於聽覺之外，然後只讓回聲進入。</p>
<p>蝙蝠並非僅有之能聽得超高速音波之動物，但能自發超高要速音波而復利用其回聲以自引自遵者，目前所發現者僅有蝙蝠而已，是亦為一自然界之一奇蹟。</p>

<p>科學常識</p>
<h3>大蟹與紅柿</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>「蟹與柿是相　的，不可一起吃」。這是一個很普遍的傅說。也很有一部分人深信不疑。這個傅說的由來確已很久，明朝李時珍就說過「不可與柿同食，食則發　亂，動風。」</p>
<p>曾有　集先生以科學方法實驗過。他將蟹去腸胃後，洗淨，加鹽，煮熟後，與等量的柿（去皮）相拌和，餵給白鼠及犬吃兩天，都無毒象，體溫，糞便的顏色與次數經詳細觀察，結果正常，毫無病象。（原實驗見「科學」二十四卷七期）</p>
<p>這個相　的傅說由來大約曾有得病或死亡的人恰好吃了蟹與柿；或是吃得太多，超過食量，暴食而致病，於是即　　於這二種食物的「相　」。其實單是一種食物，如果狂吃，亦可致病，或竟死亡，豈可獨怨蟹和柿呢！</p>
<h3>殘廢者的福音</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>我們將要看見　子們用「光學手杖」了，這是用來幫助盲人的　覺的。用一道光線可以準確地探測到二十呎以內的障礙物。</p>
<p>這種裝置和雷達相似，不過不用知波而用可看見的光線罷了。一個像麵包大小的九磅的匣子，拿在一隻手耳機上去。</p>
<p>樹木，人物，階梯和別的物體可以被盲人聽見，使用人在聽慣國所發出的各種長短不同的聲音後，可以很熟練地辨別出物體的遠近。</p>
<p>一種新的改良的電臂是用電池和馬達來轉動的，重量是三磅，撑在拐杖上，而用裝在腰部的皮帶來轉動，在一年以內，美國殘廢的退伍軍人都可能有這種設備。</p>
<p>盲人可以用一種新的輔助器來幫助讀書，這種設置能將印在紙上的字變為清晰的聲音，而使盲人聽到，盲人用一枝像大號自來水筆樣的東西指着一個字，在這枝筆「頭」上有一道光線連結作用到一個擴大管。</p>
<p>每個字發出五種不同的聲音，讀者可以從一個幫助聽覺的耳機設備裏聽到聲音，這個電管器具的總重量祇有五又四分之一磅，它能够讀出所有的印刷體字。</p>
<p>德國人發明了一種假脚，這是用連結到斷腿的壞了的神經末端的電動機構來控制的，德國發明家們相信在神經裏流過的微量的電流能供給原動力，並且可以用腦子來控制，可以照使用人的意思來行動，這種「電腿」當戰爭是結束時仍舊在實驗時期。美國的科學家們對這裝置的性能有些懷疑，但正在作更進一步的研究。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>木材結構談</h3>
<p>— 唐耀</p>
<p>常常有人問我，「中國那一種木材最好」，我的回答是，「看你做什麼用途」。因為堅實的木料，一般說來，雖然很好，可是不一定適合於各種用途。譬如造紙的木材，要色淺，質輕，紋直，晨輕的商用木材如巴沙木（Balsa），也有它的特殊用途，如做為浮圈，可以求生。吾國所產最輕之泡桐木，日人用它做木屐；刨成薄木，貼在紙上，稱為泡桐紙，用做聖誕節的賀年片，在戰前盛銷於美國。諸如此類，可知木材的好壞是相對的，不是絕對的。正如判斷一個人一樣，我們可以說某甲那幾點好，某乙那幾點不好；因為一個人的性質，木材也是這樣。</p>
<p>各種木材，有其優點，亦有其劣點。木材與金屬材料較；（1）以其質量言，比較質輕；（2）容易鋸刨；（3）容易用機械的方法加以黏結或定釘；（4）易於油漆；（5）易於　黏；（6）能吸收　東，能承受相當之壓力及彎曲；（7）不易導熱及傅聲；（8）有美麗的色澤；（9）易於漂浮；（10）易於分離供為　維原料；（11）可以注射防腐劑或其化學品；（12）因溫度之差異，脹縮不大等優點。反之，木材亦有其劣點，最　著的是：（1）易受外界濕度的影響，使木材不絕發生脹縮，翹曲，甚至開裂；（2）力學抗强變異性極大；（3）有節及其他瑕疵，不易挑選具同一標準的材料；（4）易於着火；（5）易受菌害蟲害等之侵蝕，而致腐敗。因此吾人須明暸它的結構及組成，始能利用它的長處，避免它的短處；更進一步，以便改進它的短處。</p>
<p>誰都知道木材是植物所生成的一種複雜化合物，在植物本揣，是用它做輸導水分支持全體，或者還能儲藏食物。各種植物，有各種機構。譬如說松樹的木材，同楠木不一樣。但是就它自身說，都是很好的配合，最適於它們的生活。</p>
<p>可是我們把樹木砍伐下來，供給我們使用，做種種的用途，那就要看我們能不能充分「因材施用」了。</p>
<p>木材是植物生成；植物是有生命的，所以木材不像銅鐵，在它的成長過程中，處處農桑到外界的影響：譬如生長的土壤，雨量，溫度等氣候變動的因子，蟲害病害的侵蝕，生長的疏密，甚至森林的科學管理等，在在都可以影響到木材的最後成品。這些環境的變動，記載在木材上的，我們可以從木材橫切面上生長輪（Growth　Ring）或縱面上生長帶（Growth　Layea）的疏密，每生長輪中　材（Late　Wood　Band）之多少，以及木材細胞（Wood　Cells）的胞壁（Cell　Wall）的原薄，甚至構成木材各種細胞之數量等等，加以間接的推斷。</p>
<p>各種木材的結構，是有相當的差異；就是同一樹種，因為生長的地方不同，也可差別懸殊。甚至生在同一地方的同樹種，根部或基部，枝部同主幹，以及不同高度不同心距的木材；都有差異。而且這些差異的程度，在同樹種，很可能大於不同的種類。因此種種，使得這有機性的木材，極富於變異性（Variability），在使用上及材性研究上都發生極大的困難。</p>
<p>稍為懂得植物學的人，都知道木材不像銅鐵水泥等是實體的東西，而是特化了的「管狀細胞」（Tracheary　Elements　or　tubularfiber-units　or　cells）黏結而成。　這種特化的細胞，在植物體上以輸導水分為主：就是把根所吸收的水分同無機鹽類，經過這些細胞，轉運到　造食物的　子裏。</p>
<p>若把木材的橫斷面，放大在顯微鏡裏看，　如蜂窩一樣。每一個管空腔；用專門名詞說，前者呌做「細胞壁」，後者呌做「細胞腔」（Cell　Cavity）。在鄰近的胞壁上，還有許多的小洞或凹穴，使得樹木在生長時，可以四通八達；這些沒有長厚的細胞壁，呌做「紋孔」（Pit）。木材裏的管狀細胞，可以大別為兩類：一類是不打通的管子，上下連接，如同竹幹是一節一節的合成；不過在木材不像那樣整齊罷了。此類的細胞，呌做「管胞」（Tracheid），構成松柏類（Conifers　or　Coniferae）木材的主體（世界上僅有三屬的裸子植物沒有管胞），它的長度，平均約2-4耗m.m.其鄰生壁（指左右相鄰之胞壁）有重紋孔（Borderedpit）。還有一類的「管狀細胞」，其底壁的一部分或全部分消失，成為直立一串的細胞，合生而成無定長之管狀構造；它們的鄰生壁，也有重紋孔。這類的細胞，平均的長度在一耗以下，呌做「導管」（Vessel）為各種　　材（Broaded　Leafep　Tress）如楊木　木所特有（世界上僅有四屬的　　材沒有導管）。所以這兩類的細胞，在木材的性質上根重要。</p>
<p>說到松柏材同　　材，有兩點相當的商用慣語，可以介紹。一般所稱的「軟材類」（Softwoods），如松木柏木杉是。　　樹的木材，通常稱為「硬材類」（Hardwoods），如楊木柏木　木是。這兩名詞，已被各國所通用，完全相等於植物學上的松柏材或　　材，它的涵養，僅僅代表兩大類之木材，與木材之輕重，毫無關係。譬如鐵杉這種　材，較楊木重多硬多了。（未完）</p>

<h3>從側面看</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>有眼睛的人，必須多用眼睛，耳朵聽來的東西，祇能當作眼睛的參考，除非是瞎子，才專靠不可靠的耳朶。</p>
<p>能用眼睛的人，不僅懷疑自己的耳朶，即自己的「肉眼」，也不過於相信，他們決不以認識眼前的形形色色爲滿足，他們要套上望遠鏡，從現在看到遙遠的將來，利用顯微鏡，揭發看不見的秘密。凡人能站在正確的角度，把事象的前因後果，看得淸淸楚楚，則眼前的變化，無論多麼離奇，也不會慌慌張張，失去常態。不過，那些先天的近視，而又在暗中摸索的人們，就算橫在前而的，不是陷穽，毫無阻碍，而是一條坦坦的大路，也不敢大胆試步，像這樣的生活，的確是痛苦的。</p>
<p>人生於世，萬不可眼巴巴地正視現實。正視現實，常由於用目過度，愈看愈糢糊，甚至被現實所籠罩，自己就是現實的一部份。何如能從現實的籠罩中，毅然地抽拔出來，揮一揮衣袖，拍凈身上的紅塵，悄悄地躱在超利害的一邊，從側面看現實，或許能認識現實，找出許多未曾發現的奧妙來。</p>
<p>今之人對於貪官汚吏，國積居奇的奸商，蓋已深惡痛絕，絕無好感矣！不但此也，即那些食汚國積之徒，在平旦時分，良心發現時，亦必深自內疚，自認罪孼深重，不自殞滅，而禍延人民的。不過，這種極端的論調，有時失却中庸，殊不能在無用的敗絮中，勉强尋出有用的質素，聊以自慰。從正面看，貪汚囤積的手段，固能使國家受害，人民遭殃，弄到大家度日如年，朝不保暮；然從側面看，貪汚囤積手的段，原來是中國人一條發財的捷徑，其妙用如何，因之而發財的人，定有自知之明。凡食毛踐土之倫，誰不想發財，發財而居然開拓了這樣一條終南捷徑，則食汚囤積的手段，雖被多數受苦的老百姓所反對，必爲少數受用不盡的人所贊同是無疑的。</p>
<p>美國議會淸除官吏貪汚案，呌作扒大糞，是則沒有造糞的貪汚官吏，就無須借重扒糞的淸道夫。貪汚囤積之徒，旣然滿坑滿谷，而扒　的淸道夫，爲了事實的需要，也就不能不增多起來。額外之外，附加各種額外的名目，從事於淸除貪汚囤積的工作。從正面看，貪汚國積的手段，雖：但從側面看，由於若干人的努力造　，獲致輝皇的成就，却使另有若干人獲得了飯碗的保障，也是無疑的·正因爲大糞愈扒愈多，而扒糞的任務，遂更賦予時代的意義了，假使眞有弊絕風淸的—天，那些專靠扒　爲業的淸道夫，祇有宣吿退休，我覺得這一個失業問題，也是相常嚴重的。所以，萬百事情，切不可眼巴巴地正視現實，應該從各方面看看，正面看不出，就從反面看，從側面看，你就知道黑暗是光明的襯托，大　是芳香的强調，造物者之造物，各盡其奧妙，我輩凡夫實沒有空傷腦筋，長吁短嘆的必要！</p>
<h3>「小姐」考</h3>
<p>— 娟</p>
<p>今人尊稱女郞類曰「小姐」，考錢惟演「玉堂逢辰錄」「掌茶酒宮人韓小姐」，「小姐」二字始於此見之。然猶是人名，非稱謂也，故未見以之入詩。自明人有「簾前三寸弓鞋露，知是婹婹小姐來」之句，「小姐」二字始見於詩中矣。</p>
<h3>危機</h3>
<p>— 曾參</p>
<p>一個法國畫家，在酒店裏喝酒的時侯偶然看見地下有一張別人遺下的報紙，報紙上的大標題是：「經濟危機即將來臨」。</p>
<p>等到他喝完了1杯酒，侍役問他要不要再添一杯的時候，他就拒絕了，因爲「經濟危機即將來臨。」</p>
<p>酒店老板呌起來：「經濟危機要來了嗎？那麼我的妻子的新大衣就不該做了。」仙就去吿訴時裝公司老板。</p>
<p>時裝公司老板說：「經濟危機要來了嗎？那麼我們這公司不該再裝修門面了。」他就去吿訴營造廠主人。</p>
<p>營造廠主人　了一口氣：「經濟危機要來了嗎？那麼我的太太就不該再化了高價叫畫家來盡像了。」</p>
<p>畫家接到了營造廠主人取銷畫像之約的信，心中自然不快，又到酒店去喝酒了。酒店老板這幾天意興蘭珊，連店堂也懶得時侍役們收拾。那位畫家幾天前看見的報，還是在地下。他又把那條大標題新聞讀了一邇。但是，當他再看一看道張報紙的日期時，他不禁呌了起來—原來這是一張兩年前的　報！</p>
<h3>懷念紐約客</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>戰爭時代，我們普遍地感到雜誌荒，不論中西文雜誌，一致感到衰落缺乏，尤其是西文雜誌，除了機册Bank　Copy以外，簡直沒有新的。</p>
<p>自去年起，西文雜誌　湧到上海來，使我們又能一擴眼界。其中有數稱雜誌是過期的海外軍用版，這對於沒有到內地去的人還是新鮮的，所以海外版的雜誌在上海銷路極好。例如「紐約客」就是海外版的一種，版式比平時正常的小一半，文字內容全部相同，就只缺少了廣吿，字型小了一倍而已。</p>
<p>海外版斷絕之後，普通的雜誌都有進口，惟有「紐約客」直到現在還沒看到有新的到來。何以在各種各式的雜誌都有　來的今日，獨缺這木銷路非常廣，文字內容非常通俗的「紐約客」雜誌，不見降臨上海，實在是一個謎。</p>
<p>「紐約客」是一本幽默而又正經的一般讀物。開卷的「評註」嬉笑怒駡，光怪陸離，雖然反映的是紐約的一個社會，然而却是世界人士所歡喜知道的一點秘辛。以後的小說，特寫，書報評論，電影介紹，人物描寫，都保住了「紐約客」特有的風格。就是其中的漫畫，題頭黑白畫，也代表了「紐約客」的個性，不但是他們的特色，而且更影響到其他刋物，採取了同一作風的漫畫</p>
<p>英文大美晚報上有時轉載「紐約客」上的文章，使我們能獲睹一鱗半爪，因此使我們更其懷念這本好得太好的滿載着親切文字的雜誌了。</p>
<h3>「筆端」無用論</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>韓詩外傳云：「君子避三端，避武士之鋒端，避辯士之古端，避文士之筆端。」這三者在古人眼中，尤以「筆端」爲最厲害。所謂「孔子作春秋而亂臣賊子懼。」何以故？因爲「一字之誅，嚴於斧鉞」是也。</p>
<p>不過話雖如此，而每一個朝代的亂臣賊子，仍然此仆彼繼，代有崛起。亦可見「筆端」並不一定會眞的那樣使人可怕。這又昧歸於甚麼呢？我以爲乃是自孔子以後立書著說的文人，不少流於「御用」或「有文無行」的緣故。</p>
<p>孔老夫子爲學與做人的態度是非常嚴肅的。「道不行」寗可「乘桴浮於海」，決不肯馬虎茍且，因此他所著作的春秋，便成爲「冰霜一語，斧鉞千秋」的大業了。這豈是一般流於「御用」或「有文無行」的文人所能望其背項的。因此，後來「筆端」的力量也只有愈來愈無用了。</p>
<p>譬如　汪彥章，雖然名列名文苑，爲汀南詞臣　冕，但是由於其謟諛及醜詆李綱一事看來，前後矛盾，反覆無常，也將於證明其爲一「舞弄文墨」毫無骨氣的小以而已。在他賀李綱右丞一文中，有云：「精忠貫日，正二　傾側之中；　氣橫秋，　萬　笑談之頃。旣高名而衆媚，乃　就而身危。士訟公寃，亟舉幡而集闕下；帝從民望，令免胃以見國人。」對李的推崇可謂備至。後李爲張浚所誣落職，彥軍乃草制云：「朋姦罔上，有　必去于驩兜；欺世盜名，孔子先誅夫正卯。專殺尙威、傷列聖好生之德；估讒喜佞，爲一時羣小之宗。」前後同屬一人，其反覆如此，這樣的「筆端」，當然便起不了大作用了。其誣好人猶見如此，假若舉向「亂臣賊子，」則「亂臣賊子」不僅要在一旁竊笑，而且正好「以子之矛，攻子之盾」，給對方揭出嘴臉來呢！</p>
<p>自然，像汪彥章之流，每一朝代都會多得如「恒河沙數」。民初以後，軍閥竊國，「槍端」大抬其頭，此風一長，「筆端」當然如江河之日下了。古人所謂應避三端之一的「筆端」，在今日已流爲無用之廢物，不亦宜乎！</p>
<h3>巴魯樞的幽默</h3>
<p>— 意</p>
<p>美國前任原子能委員會主席巴魯樞，有一次邀了一個朋友到他鄉下的別歌去打獵。那位朋友一心想打到機隻野鴨，可是子彈化　了不少，一無成就。巴魯樞看他的手段實在不高妙，可是自然也不便批評什麼。</p>
<p>那位朋友到臨別的前一天。獵興依舊不减，他走到樹林裏一看，正好有一隻大野鴨棲在樹枝上，他連忙輕輕走近，仔細瞄準﹁砰」的一槍，野鴨應聲而墮！</p>
<p>他高興之極，趕快俯下身去檢起來，但是仔細看時，却見野鴨頸邊有一張字條，上而寫着「巴魯樞敬贈　幾個字。</p>
<h3>看「英國山水」</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>跟着小市民階級的抬頭，歐洲的山水畫，便從十七世紀頃的荷蘭發達起來。然而，在這一個部門見到奇花異葩的，倒是英吉利的畫獲。</p>
<p>當然，山水畫的發達，是與厭惡科學生活而憧憬於田園生活不無關係的。因之，產業革命首先完成於英國，而山水　之以英國爲宣著，那長不容懷疑的了。</p>
<p>最近，英國文化委員會在大新畫廊舉行一個「英國山水展覽會」，陳列彩色山水畫複造品及照片五十點，給滬上人士瀏覽、我們對之，固然可飽餐三島秀色，可是以藝術欣賞立塲說，這二十九幅山水畫的彩色複製品，郤可以注目一下的。</p>
<p>英國的著名世界的畫家，是泰納（Turner）與康斯泰勃爾（Constable）是自然主義的二大家，他們的山水畫，給予十九世紀末印象主義繪畫色光的影響，着實巨大。泰納的色彩鮮艷美麗；康斯泰勃爾的日光輝煌悅目。這一次的展覽中，前者共有四幀，而以十四號「越過小溪」的作風堪稱代表，其他不過是水彩習作而已。後者僅有十三號「風景」一幀。明暗光錢，配列得體，不愧傑作。</p>
<p>早二氏的名家是庚斯保羅（Cainsborough），桑特毘（Sandby），高德曼（Calmen），也多有作品列入，雖然不能窺英國山水輩歷史的全豹，然亦可由此概見一二了。</p>
<p>英國的山水畫，特別是水彩畫，它似乎具有傳統的形式的。在這次的出品中，福倫（Pliot）與亨特（Hunt）二人的作品可說完全是保守這個傳統。但十九世紀未法闡西塞尙（Cezanne）的風格，以及後來的新即物主義等所謂新興業派的傾向，也已打入了保守的英國畫壇之中，十七號Dukes　Dairy（惠特E·White作）的畫面，那種團塊的表現，無疑是承受了寒尙的技法了。但新興畫派，畢竟發達於歐洲大陸，隔海的英吉利，如納許（Nash），尼芬孫（Nevioson）等的作品，形式已經受巴黎畫風的洗禮，但體味起來，表現力還不够充實，堅強。</p>
<p>多時沒有接觸歐洲藝術的氣味了，看英國山水畫，確實也感到無窮的興味。</p>
<h3>洗刷惡名法</h3>
<p>— 業</p>
<p>南非洲的加非族土著有一種爲罪犯洗刷惡名的辦法，他們拿起一把滿是沸水的茶壺，對準壺口把那個罪人的名字大呌　遍，趕快就用蓋子蓋緊。讓這個惡名在水壺中連「浸」許多天之後，這罪犯的名聲就又算是淸的了。</p>
<h3>繡像重慶評話之二　梁山泊的畫家</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　高龍生畫</p>
<p>上海一個大學生在三輪車上　到一萬五千元，西安一位敎授當倫兒，在報上被登出來時，大抵被標上「斯文掃地」這一題∥，其實掃地的斯文們不自此事發現始（在重慶一個美術學校就有敎務長竊同事的破大衣以求一飽的事），早成爲「狗咬人」的新聞了。</p>
<p>在雲南吧，一個中學的圖畫敎員巷學生畫了一幅壁報報頭的畫出了毛病，這本不足爲奇，奇怪的是他說：我免得天天愁米愁柴，同學們不必爲我譁然，我是不求仁而得仁了。</p>
<p>在戰時，畫家的最大市場是四川出鹽的自流井和出糖的內江，大抵到那裏開開展覽會便可吃個半年三個月，因爲那裏有的是財主，而財主也願意賣個面子，結交些風雅朋友沖淡一下銅臭氣。</p>
<p>而現在，則畫家的畫一送去，便只有打回票。</p>
<p>前些時，重慶有一位美術敎授持得意之作登一個大亨朋友之門求售，閽者特畫進去，畫退出來，却以一萬元打發此畫家，簡直不但把他當打狄風的，而且是化盤纏的叫化子，這位敎授先生哭笑不得。</p>
<p>水滸傳上的大盜，聖手書生蕭讓，玉臂猿金大堅一個是書家，一個是金石家，不圖今日發現於離重慶不遠的「梁山」。一批土匪裏有一個副領導人便是留法學畫的陳某。</p>
<p>求生之慾被壓縮是有限度的，一逾此限，一手持畫，一手特槍，也許有那一天。「筆尖兒橫掃幾千人」是王實甫吹牛，槍尖兒橫掃一個人却並非荒唐的夢。</p>

<p>第二章　娓娓淸談　（八）</p>
<p>紈頓了一頓，又道：「我一聽這話，哭了，但是二位先生辭意堅決，無法挽回，這完全爲哥哥幾句話得罪他們，他二位不敎我戲，我前途還有什麼希望！每天只是哭，埋怨哥哥不對，我父親主張我不必再學戲，以我們書香門第，女孩子應該上學念書，我說已經學過戲，苒抱書本念書，也念不了。我天天哭，父親一見着我就是罵，父女之間爲意見不對，常吵起來。我哥哥見父親天天爲我生氣，便讓我搬出來，在這十二號居住。」</p>
<p>綺紈說到這裏，很是感觸，話鋒便又頓住。渚齋聽了，覺得一個弱女子爲藝術如此奮鬥，受了種種阻礙，心裏極表同情，說道：「原來如此。顧老板，你也算不幸，爲學戲受過這　磨折。」綺紈黯然道：「道只怪我命運不好吧。一說着，把茶几的茶杯，端起喝了一口，又接讀說道：一我在　悶無聊之中，總算天不絕人，天津戲院派人來約我和我哥哥到天津挑頭牌出演，我哥哥已答應了，不知爲了什麼，又不肯去。我一個女孩子如何能單身出外！急得沒法，又去求朱師傅帮忙，朱師傅不肯，我再三懇求說：師傅旣然疼愛我，還得像以前那樣疼愛我，我說時幾乎要哭了，朱師傳也很難過，他說可惜你不是男孩子，假如是男孩子，我豁出去，也要給你想辦法。你家父親，哥哥，都不是好應付的，這次爲了你前途關係，我不能不陪你去天津一次，以後可不能爲例。」這一塲難關，總虧朱師傳熱心帮忙，給我渡過。我rll天津回來，朱師傳因爲我在天津旣挑頭牌，現在再充配角，給人跨刀，前途仍有妨礙，在北平只好繼續唱頭牌，大胆地唱了幾塲，都賣滿座。從那時候起到現在，才正式過着舞台生活，現在正學全部王春娥，以及改正「楊貴妃」，「玉堂春」幾　戲，每天下午有工夫，就到朱師傳家裏學戲，練功。」</p>
<p>渚齋道：「現在顧老板成名了，老太爺一定很滿意。」綺紈道：「不，我父親脾氣不好，，近來又多病，對我仍是不滿意，我也覺得我的藝術還很幼稚，距離成功很遠。」渚齋道：「你太客氣，我能像老板的唱工百分之一二，就滿意了。」綺紈道：「那來的話。」芷說到這裏，小王媽端了可可和點心進來，綺統一而　　着吃些點心，一面問道：「徐先生，擬的學戲過程，也可以吿訴我嗎？」　齋很忸怩道：「我完全是胡鬧，根本就沒有拜過老師。費老板是我姑丈，我常到他家裏去，他有時也對我說說，可惜他是　生，我的嗓子又不宜唱　生。」綺紈道：「能够這樣也很難得了，你的嗓子眞好，再加深造，一定成名。不過你是不需要這個的，你現在辦一個機關服務？」渚齋道：「國高銀行營業處。」綺　道：「你府上有什麼人？」渚齋道：「我父母，還有內人。」綺紈聽了，兩眼又看在電　上，　一凝神，停一會又道：「你的太太，一定很美麗罷？」　齋正要說時，却見小王媽向綺　微微努一努嘴，要叫她出去。綺紈却坐着不動，問道：「有什麼事，你說吧。」小王媽道：「林局長連來兩次電話，我都吿訴他不在家，現在又派汽車來接，說老板再不去，林局長要親來。」　　聽了，眉頭一蹙，足下高跟鞋的後跟，在地上一　道：「欠　　債，走吧！」（六　完）</p>

<h3>The Center of the Southern Henan Battle Shifts Westward; Part of the Bandits Sneaks Across the Pinghan Railway and is Surrounded; Nationalist Forces Advance Rapidly, Directly Approaching Luoshan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiujiang, 7th] Fierce battles are taking place today in the area east of the Luoshan-Xuanhuadian Highway and the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan. The main force of Liu's First Column and about two brigades of the Twelfth Column are fiercely attacking westward. Their vanguard, about 4,000 bandits, secretly crossed the Pinghan Railway south of Xinyang at Liulin Station at dawn on the 7th and fled westward. They are now surrounded and attacked by Nationalist forces in Tanhe Town, not far from the railway, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The bandits in Songbu, Macheng, are now being attacked by Nationalist forces and have suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, the bandits set fire in Macheng and Songbu. When our air force scouted over the area in the afternoon, they still saw raging fires.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 7th] Provincial Senator Duan Xisan stated at a tea party hosted by Minister Bai that the situation in northern Hubei is also critical, with part of the bandit army crossing the Han River and reaching Yunxi.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 7th] The Nationalist forces that captured Luotian are taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Songbu and Macheng. In one fell swoop, they drove the bandits from the Yinjia River area northwest of Songbu towards the northwest, and are still pursuing and suppressing them. In addition, the First Column of bandits that fled to Yuwangcheng is now attempting to cross the road west of Liulin Station. Nationalist forces are intercepting them.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Jiujiang, 6th] The main forces of Liu's First, Second, and Tenth Columns are invading southward on the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway. Over the past three days, they have been moving southwest under the combined attack of Nationalist forces from the north and south. The focus of the battle has gradually shifted from the highway to intercepting the railway line. The main force of the First Column and part of the Tenth Column crossed Luoshan southeast of Zhou Dangfan on the 6th and fled west along the Xuanhuadian Highway. They are now in the Yangjia Dian and Wanjia Dian area, about 40 kilometers south of Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway line. Nationalist forces are attacking from both the front and the rear. Based on the front-line battle reports and bandit situation assessments of the past three days, Liu's bandits, under pressure in the Dabie Mountains, cannot realize their delusional dream of establishing a base there. They are now determined to concentrate their main forces and risk a westward offensive, attempting to secretly cross the Pinghan Railway south of Xinyang and north of Jigong Mountain to peer into the Tongbai Mountains and join forces with Chen Geng and Li Xiannian, who are entrenched in Nanzhao and Neixiang. In addition, Liu's Third Column, originally based in the area between Macheng and Luotian, is coordinating with Liu's main force in the operation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Nationalist forces in southern Henan continue to advance rapidly along different routes, directly approaching Luoshan, Guangshan, and the nests of Li's bandits. Some Nationalist forces are sweeping through the areas of Popi River and Yanjia River.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Urges the Bandit Army to Wake Up and Seek Opportunities to Surrender; He Also Admonishes the People in the Bandit Areas to Cooperate with the Nationalist Army</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Jiujiang, 6th] Minister Bai today issued a "Letter to Commanders and Fighters of Liu Bocheng's Troops," calling on the bandit army cadres to wake up, turn back, seize the opportunity, and surrender to the central government, becoming upright Nationalist soldiers of the Republic of China. Bai also informed them that the Nationalist army has established Peace and Patriotism Groups in Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hefei, and Xinyang, and reception stations in various counties near the bandit areas, welcoming bandit cadres to come over. The upper left corner of the leaflet is printed with the words "Hand in this leaflet to surrender, the Nationalist army will provide reception and protection." Bai also published a "Letter to the People in the Areas Infested by Communist Bandits," admonishing the people in the bandit areas to take the Nanyang People's Corps in southern Henan, which helped the Nationalist army defeat the Communist bandits, as an example, hoping that the people in the bandit areas will quickly cooperate with the Nationalist army, defend their homes, and eliminate the Communist bandits so that they can live in peace. These two types of leaflets will be distributed by airplanes in the battlefields and areas infested by bandit armies.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Senate Tea Party Hosts Minister Bai; Bai Emphasizes Organizing and Training the People</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 7th] The entire membership of the Provincial Senate held a tea party in Hankou at 3:00 PM on the 7th to host Minister Bai. During the meeting, Speaker He and Senator Duan Xisan delivered speeches of consolation one after another and offered suggestions for suppressing the rebellion. Minister Bai then delivered an impromptu speech, emphasizing the importance of the people's self-defense forces, saying that today's suppression of bandits cannot rely solely on field armies to capture points and lines; it is necessary to mobilize the people and destroy the underground organizations of the Communist bandits in order to achieve overall control. Bai then announced the central government's decisions on organizing and training the people: (A) Local self-defense forces are allowed to be privately owned by the counties and townships, and the Nationalist army is prohibited from incorporating or conscripting them. (B) The expenses of the self-defense forces of each county must also be approved by the council, and each is allowed to raise funds locally.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] After returning from inspecting the defenses of Jilin and Changchun, Luo Zhuoying recently told reporters that the people of Jilin and Changchun have strong confidence and high morale. He continued: The bandit army's strategy is to proceed from "digging surfaces," "cutting lines," and "isolating points" to "exhausting points" and "withering points," focusing on the economy. Our countermeasures are "consolidating points," "connecting money," and "expanding surfaces." The "connecting lines" work is currently in progress.</p>
<p>"Another Telegram" Deputy Commander of a certain army corps, Gan Jiaxiang, recently arrived in Shenyang from the Western Liaoning defense zone to report to Director Chen and fulfill his duties.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Nationalist army in northern Anhui continues to pursue and suppress westward. On the 7th, they began to conduct mopping-up operations between Shenqiu and Linquan. Several units of Chen's First, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns fled to Xiangcheng, Zhoukou, Fanting, Shuizhai, and other places to harass. The Nationalist army is tracking and pursuing them from Qiuchu Village and Lixin Village. Since the 5th, the Nationalist army in southern Shandong has been cooperating with local teams to encircle and suppress Chen Yi's bandit troops who are harassing the mountainous areas from Sishui, Zhanqiao, Zou County, and other places. They have now completed the encirclement. The pacification work in that area will soon be fully completed, and the safety of the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be expected. The overall situation in Shandong Province will undergo a complete change.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Jinan, 7th] Fierce battles have been raging in Laiyang City for days.

<h3>Anbian Captured in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 7th] Military news: Taking advantage of the Nationalist army's dispatch to Yulin, the bandit army in northern Shaanxi, who was behind in the rear, fled and occupied Ningtiaoliang and Anbian and other places. After the siege of Yulin was lifted, our returning troops immediately launched a clearing operation in Anbian and other places. They advanced to the border of Anbian on the morning of the 5th and engaged in a fierce battle with the remnants of the bandit's 11th Brigade defending the territory.

<h3>Hong Lan You Discusses Preparatory Work; National Assembly to be Convened Within a Month; December 25th is the Beginning of Constitutional Rule</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated on the evening of the 7th that the National Assembly's preparatory work is actively underway. When a reporter inquired about the date of the National Assembly, Hong stated that December 25th is truly a landmark day. Before that, it was the period of political tutelage, and from then on, constitutional rule will begin. The 25th is not the day the Constitutional National Assembly will be convened, but constitutional rule has already begun, so the session may not exceed one month. According to Hong's observation, the biggest task in this meeting will be the election of the president and vice president. The constitution has not yet been implemented, so there is probably no need to amend it, but there is no explicit provision that it cannot be amended, so it is not yet known whether a constitutional amendment will be proposed at this meeting. However, based on speculation, the duration of the conference may be ten days. Hong also stated that the preparatory work for this conference will particularly focus on cost savings.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] News on Election Results: The results of the National Assembly election have been reported to the Election Headquarters by more than 600 units. Before the 10th of this month, the Election Headquarters will report the full results to the government so that the government can decide to issue the National Assembly convening order.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Huaining, 6th] The votes for the vocational categories for the National Assembly election were counted on the 6th, with the results as follows: Chinese Medicine: Chen Cunren 72 votes, Xue Ziqing 22 votes. Telecommunications: Zhu Yicheng 175 votes. Education Association: Hu Zheshu 122 votes. Lawyers: All votes were obtained by Dai Tianqiu. Western Medicine: All votes were obtained by Xu Huainan, Xu Huainan (the character "Nan" with a missing wood radical) is invalid. Reporters: Zhao Junhao 52 votes, Feng Youzhen 10 votes.</p>
<h3>Provinces and Cities in the Northeast That Have Not Been Recovered Have Begun to Conduct Elections</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The electoral offices of Andong, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Xing'an, Dalian, Harbin and other unrecovered provinces and cities are now issuing orders to set up registration stations in Shenyang, Changchun and the vicinity of Shenyang in accordance with the Supplementary Regulations and Implementation Measures for the Election of National Assembly Representatives and Legislators, and National Assembly Representative and Legislator voters and candidates residing in various provinces and cities (candidates must submit resumes and signatures of more than 50 people). Nationals with special living habits in the interior can participate in regional occupational and women's elections, without separate arrangements. The methods for the election of National Assembly Representatives of the Manchu nationality are still under revision and supplementation, and will be handled in separate cases.</p>

<h3>Kuomintang Decides to Concede Individual Legislator Candidate Quotas; Central Standing Committee Supports Allied Parties in the Election</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a temporary meeting on the 7th to discuss the list of legislator candidates from the Democratic and Youth parties. The three principles decided by the small group meeting on the 6th were approved, and Kuomintang members would make further concessions and do their best to support the election of allied parties, and they were immediately handed over to the small group meeting for discussion and coordination of the list.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the Kuomintang Central 14-member committee decided on the principle of legislator self-nomination election in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, the reactions of people from the Democratic and Youth parties here are slightly different. A spokesman for the Youth Party said that in principle, they do not object, but the method is worth discussing. They do not know whether the free election means that the Kuomintang does not support the legislator candidates of the two parties in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, or whether it means that they fundamentally abandon the principle of party nomination. We do not agree with the latter, because party nomination does not hinder free election. The Youth Party's candidates for the Beijing and Shanghai areas have not yet been determined, because Beijing and Shanghai are areas where talents gather, so those who are produced in the future must be well-known figures. The current problem is that those who are qualified in terms of qualifications and prestige are unwilling to serve as candidates, and most of those who are willing to be candidates have problems in terms of qualifications and prestige, so a final decision has not yet been made. A senior official of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: Free election is a question of content, not a dispute over principles. If there can truly be free competition under fair conditions, this party will naturally have no objection. However, if one party occupies special advantages and conveniences and controls the grassroots organizations of various districts and baojia, then it should be discussed separately.</p>
<h3>Appointed Senators from Two Parties; Report After Receiving Notification</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] People from the Democratic and Youth parties here have stated that although the list of appointed senators has been announced, they have not yet received written notification, presumably because the official procedures are time-consuming. Once they receive it, they will immediately report to the local Senate. Regarding the election of supervisors, representatives of the three parties in Nanjing are negotiating, and there are no concrete results yet.</p>
<h3>Hunan Kuomintang Supervisory Committee Member Li Ruxian Commits Suicide Due to Illness</h3>

<h3>Countries Needing US Aid Should First Use Their People's Deposits in the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, United Press] A motion was made in the House of Representatives tonight to urge foreign governments that need US aid to appropriate the funds and capital of their own people in the United States. Republican Congressman Keating of New York said: He intends to submit two amendments to the $590 million emergency foreign aid bill on the 8th of this month, suggesting that the United States should not assist countries that cannot use the funds of certain of their citizens in the United States.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Naval Agreement to be Signed in Nanjing this Afternoon</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Sino-US Naval Agreement will be signed this afternoon of the 8th. The US side will be represented by Ambassador Stuart, and the Chinese side will be represented by Admiral Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. Gui is still working in Qingdao and is scheduled to return here on the morning of the 8th to preside over everything. According to this agreement, the US decision to help us train the navy and transfer warships during wartime will come to an end. Most of the transferred warships have already arrived in China in a steady stream and are being taken over and used by the navy and customs. The rest are also on the way. The Naval Headquarters has also scheduled a signing ceremony and a wine party after the signing ceremony on the 8th to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Ye Gongchao Issues a Statement Reaffirming Our Position on Convening a Preparatory Meeting for the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao declared on the 7th: Regarding the convening of a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, the Chinese government notified the relevant countries with recommendations on November 17. After the Chinese government received the Soviet government's reply on this recommendation on the 27th of the same month, it again sent a note to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 5th, reaffirming our country's position, advocating that the organization of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan and its voting procedures should follow the precedents of the Far Eastern Commission. The Chinese government stated in its reply that the task of the Far Eastern Commission has been clearly defined as deciding on all policies related to Japan's fulfillment of its obligations under the terms of surrender, and its importance is no less than that of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese government believes that, whether in terms of organizational principles or voting procedures, the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan should not deviate from the principles adopted by the Far Eastern Commission, which has been unanimously approved by the eleven member states. Such deviations will only delay the convening of the aforementioned preparatory meeting. Regarding the Soviet government's suggestion to convene a preparatory meeting in China in January 1948, if the relevant countries agree, the Chinese government is willing to accept it. However, if the relevant countries cannot agree, the Chinese government has no intention of changing its original suggestion to hold this meeting in Washington.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Drafts Secret Memorandum; Plans to Conclude a "Negotiated" Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] World News Weekly said today: Japan is trying to conclude a "negotiated" peace treaty and avoid accepting a treaty based on unconditional surrender that is completely decided by the Allied countries. The weekly disclosed the full text of a secret memorandum drafted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, which was secretly obtained from Tokyo. The memorandum reveals Tokyo's strategy for the peace conference, stating that Habomai Island and Shikotan Island, which are part of the territory of the base, should still be Japanese territory. It is also hoped that Japanese residents in Taiwan and Penghu will have the freedom to choose their nationality. According to the plan in the memorandum, Taiwanese people in Japan will acquire Chinese nationality, but compensation for the loss of Allied people's property will not be claimed from these Taiwanese people after they acquire Chinese nationality. According to this plan, since Japan's surrender, various instructions issued to the Japanese government by MacArthur, one million tons, and can own airplanes. World News Weekly analyzed the memorandum and pointed out that other Pacific islands that Japan wants to retain include the Kuril Islands, Ryukyu, Ogasawara, and Iwo Jima. It also said: None of the islands it wants to retain were obtained through aggression. Japanese newspapers have followed the Japanese government's instructions and launched a propaganda campaign to find sufficient reasons in advance for Japan's demands in the peace conference in the future. Japan will try to alienate the United States and the Soviet Union, so that they are opposed to each other, so that it can conclude more lenient treaties with the two countries.</p>
<h3>Major Issues of the China Changchun Railway; We Will Negotiate with the Soviet Side Immediately; Zou Shangyou Flies to Shenyang to Take Office Within Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Zou Shangyou, the newly appointed Assistant Director of the China Changchun Railway, is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai within days and fly to Shenyang to take office. This adjustment of personnel in this railway is of great significance, because regarding important issues such as the asset management of this railway, although our side has repeatedly notified the Soviet government to send personnel to Nanjing to discuss solutions, the Soviet personnel have not yet been assigned, so some major issues of the China Changchun Railway remain unresolved. This adjustment of senior personnel in this railway can be regarded as our government's preparation to start negotiations with the Soviet side at any time. From this, it can also be proved that our government has always faithfully fulfilled the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Zou is one of China's senior diplomats and has served in the diplomatic field for more than 20 years, and has repeatedly represented China in handling diplomatic affairs with the Soviet Union, so he has extremely rich experience in handling diplomacy with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador in Hong Kong; Will Assist in Resolving the Kowloon Issue</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, recently came to Nanjing to report on his work. In addition to making requests regarding routine matters, he also reported on the incident of the Hong Kong government ordering Chinese residents in the old city of Kowloon to relocate and demolish their houses. According to him on the 7th: Our country has not abandoned its sovereignty over the old city of Kowloon, and will continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the safety of life of the residents in the city. However, this matter is not very military. British Ambassador Stevenson happened to be inspecting overseas Chinese affairs along the Chinese coast at this time and traveled to Hong Kong, which can help resolve the issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th] Since the afternoon of the 6th, the situation in Kowloon City has been extremely tense, because the Hong Kong police have dispatched many plainclothes detectives outside the old city in an attempt to prevent reporters from contacting the residents of Kowloon City.</p>
<h3>Allied Countries Should Deeply Recognize the Significance of Our All-Out Effort to Suppress the Rebellion; Wu Tiecheng Issues a Statement on the Anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The 8th is the sixth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident. Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, issued a statement to the Central News Agency on his thoughts on the Pearl Harbor Incident. Because Wu went to Honolulu after the failure of the Second Revolution in 1914 and went to Pearl Harbor, his feelings about the place are particularly profound. Wu said: We are full of indignation about the attack on Pearl Harbor by the common enemy of the Allied countries, this kind of undeclared war, which is similar to the behavior of barbaric nations in the Middle Ages. Even though six years have passed, not only has our sense of indignation not diminished, but in today's increasingly complex and dangerous international situation, it is even more likely to arouse our greatest vigilance. Gang said: China does not want to see wars in the world again. Under any difficult circumstances, regardless of whether there is foreign aid or how much foreign aid there is, it will definitely do its best to put its own house in order, that is, to quell the rebellion of the Communist Party, so as to prevent the September 18th Incident from happening again in the Far East. However, we cannot help but regret that China's efforts to eradicate the main force of the Communist Party in the Far East have not yet been widely and deeply recognized by the friendly countries.

<h3>The Full Economic Group Decides Not to Abolish Direct Taxes</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The issue of the abolition of direct taxes has been discussed by the full economic group and it has been decided not to abolish them in principle. Some people believe that direct tax is actually a good tax system and should not be abolished.</p>
<h3>In Order to Balance National Revenue and Expenditure, Yu Hongjun and Others are Pushed to Formulate Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Yuan also discussed the issue of balancing revenue and expenditure at a temporary meeting on the evening of the 6th, and Xu Kan, Director of Accounting, presented a report on the national general budget for the 37th year. It was decided to push Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, and Xu Kan to formulate measures and submit them to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Current Financial and Economic Problems: The Government Seeks a Comprehensive Solution; US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hopper, Praises Recent Economic Measures and Hopes China Will Adopt a Realistic Foreign Exchange Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 7th] The government is urgently seeking a proper and comprehensive solution to the current national financial and economic problems. In addition to the establishment of Financial Management Bureaus by the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai and Wuhan to stabilize the financial market and curb speculative and illegal activities, and the reorganization of the Textile Adjustment Committee into the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to achieve comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth, the Executive Yuan, led by President Zhang Qun, is consulting with the heads of various ministries and commissions to adopt further control measures. It is learned that the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 6th was the beginning of this important task, with the focus on "how to seek foreign aid and how to rely on self-reliance." At the meeting, the heads of various ministries expressed their opinions on their respective businesses, especially those they felt were difficult to address. The above points were then discussed, focusing on how we should gain international trust in order to obtain the necessary foreign aid. Regarding the latter, everyone agreed that we should consider how to survive in the absence of external aid, and therefore constantly seek ways to rely on self-reliance. The opinions expressed by various parties at the meeting will be compiled by President Zhang Qun into a comprehensive plan to solve the overall financial and economic problems. This meeting will continue to be convened. It was also mentioned at the meeting that the issue of currency reform was still considered premature by the majority.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 7th] A prominent figure said on the evening of the 7th that regarding the issue of commodity controls, the government's initial control of gold and foreign exchange and the tightening of credit have moved from passive controls to active solutions. This person believes that if the tightening of credit continues, commodity prices will inevitably fall. He also expressed approval for the government's cotton yarn and cloth control measures, especially the principles of entrusted spinning and weaving, which have achieved comprehensive control. In the past, the price of yarn was restricted, but the evaluation of cotton and cloth was not controlled. Now, through entrusted spinning, weaving, unified purchasing, and unified sales, the effect of comprehensive control can be achieved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hopper, stated that it is very easy for China to absorb US$500 million worth of American production equipment for reconstruction purposes. However, Chinese and American politicians have not yet been able to resolve how to repay this import. Mr. Hopper, who left Shanghai in July of this year to hold discussions with businessmen interested in trade with China, believes that the slow pace of China's post-war reconstruction is due to internal turmoil, inflation, and insufficient transportation. He stated that the many economic measures recently taken by the Chinese government are sound and are "signs of hope," one of which is the revision of foreign exchange regulations and the supply of foreign exchange at market prices. This indicates that the Chinese government has adopted a "wise" policy to encourage domestic economic construction. However, the Chinese government must adopt a realistic foreign exchange policy because the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate is too large. In his conversations with businessmen in various American cities, Mr. Hopper found that many of them are very interested in the possibility of imports and exports in the near future. Mr. Hopper advocated that if American businessmen want to ensure their future in exports to East Asia, they must "have a greater import mentality."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Issue of the Undemarcated Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border</h3>
<p>With assurances of independence, Burma is preparing to take over British Burmese territory on January 4th next year. Burma is a good neighbor of our country, and public opinion is congratulating Burma on its independence. We also look forward to the future Sino-Burmese relations becoming better and more pleasant. However, a rather unpleasant incident has occurred between China and Burma, caused by misunderstandings arising from the Burmese government's statement on the issue of the undemarcated section of the Burma-Yunnan border. First, Mr. Zhou Kun, Director of the Territorial Affairs Department of our Ministry of Interior, gave a speech to reporters from the Nanjing Central Daily News on November 25th, analyzing the ways to resolve the outstanding issues of China's undemarcated boundaries. Subsequently, a Burmese spokesperson expressed regret over our recovery of Jiangxinpo and other places, even threatening with the words "bloodshed" and "force." In order to explain the misunderstanding, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 2nd of this month, stating that the two countries will certainly be able to seek a legal and satisfactory solution to the issue of the undemarcated section of the Yunnan-Burma border in the spirit of harmony and the provisions of the treaty. Any one-sided statement or action cannot force the other party to consider it valid. The Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not having learned of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement, stated on the 1st that Burma's national borders had already been recorded on official maps and do not need to be referred to the United Nations. The undemarcated sections should be resolved through bilateral agreement, and Burma will never give up any part of its territory. For the Burmese government, in order to ensure their territory, their words are just and righteous. We certainly express our sympathy. However, if this involves the undemarcated Sino-Burmese border, it cannot but cause regret. The statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fair and clear, and should be cherished by the Burmese government and our people. We are confident that the issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border will not form an unpleasant dispute between China and Burma. We would like to elaborate on this.</p>
<p>China and Burma have close relations. Not only are there glorious records in history, but there is also a relationship of interdependence in geography and position. The area where Yunnan and Burma meet is geographically part of the Yunnan plateau, and the terrain becomes higher the further north one goes. Famous rivers include the Salween River (also known as the Nujiang River or the Salween River), the Lancang River (also known as the Mekong River), and the Jinsha River (also known as the Irrawaddy River). Many tributaries of the three rivers are scattered along the Yunnan-Burma border. This area is indeed rich in produce and has a strategically important terrain, especially the northern section, from Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain, which is even more important. When Burma was annexed to our country, there was no strict demarcation of the border. After Burma fell to Britain, the issue of the Sino-Burmese border arose. The discussion of the Sino-Burmese border began with the "Sino-British Burma Treaty" in the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886 AD). Later, Xue Fucheng, our minister to Britain, and British Foreign Secretary Lord Salisbury signed the "Sino-British Supplementary Provisions Regarding the Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce" (the twentieth year of Guangxu, i.e., 1894), and Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang and British Minister Sir Claude MacDonald signed the "Additional Articles to the Sino-British Burma Treaty" (the twenty-third year of Guangxu, i.e., 1897), so that the borderlines between the two sides were stipulated in the treaty. However, regarding the undemarcated section in the north (Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain section) and the undemarcated section in the south (Nanding River to Nanji River section), because we did not know the actual situation of the border at that time, we were unable to demarcate it. Therefore, it was stipulated in the treaty that special officials should be sent to survey and demarcate it. The inaction and delay of the Qing dynasty's diplomacy led to many disputes on the Yunnan-Burma border in later years.</p>
<p>The Sino-Burmese border is divided into four sections: the first section is from Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain; the second section is from Jian'gao Mountain to the Nanding River; the third section is from the Nanding River to the Nanban River; and the fourth section is from the Nanban River to Vietnam. Among the above four sections of the border, the second and fourth sections were demarcated during the Guangxu period, and the third section was demarcated on June 18th of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941 AD). However, the first section remains an outstanding issue. This section is located at 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude, that is, north of Jian'gao Mountain in Tengchong, encompassing Jiangxincheng, Yeren Mountain, and the Hukang River Valley, with an area of about 200,000 square kilometers, equivalent to Zhejiang Province. The British army occupied this area for decades, and our country's repeated protests were ineffective. During the Second World War, the Japanese invaded Burma and once penetrated deep into western Yunnan. After the British army withdrew, our guerrilla forces crossed the Gaoligong Mountains and entered Jiangxinpo and other places to carry out meticulous security work. After the war ended, our army withdrew, and the British came again, unfortunately returning to the previous state. Now that Britain has granted Burma independence, this undemarcated section, which in fact was originally Chinese territory, where Chinese administrative agencies were established many times, should be unconditionally returned to China by the British and Burmese, so that the outstanding issue can be resolved and the neighborly friendship between China and Burma can be strengthened. This is not only what the people of our country hope for, but also the common goal that peaceful Far Eastern countries should pursue in today's era. The future of Sino-Burmese relations is vast and boundless. There should be no more border disputes, and threatening words or actions should not be used because of the undemarcated border.</p>
<p>We have placed unlimited hope on Burma's independence. Regarding the Sino-Burmese border demarcation issue, we would like to ask the governments of China and Burma to do three things: First, regarding the resolution of the outstanding issue of the undemarcated section of the Yunnan-Burma border, the two countries should seek diplomatic channels before January next year to break the deadlock in border negotiations. Before the outstanding issue is resolved, any unfriendly action will increase the factors of dispute. We hope that the Burmese government will resume rational management, avoid impatience, and refrain from any emotionally driven behavior. Second, the Ministry of Interior should actively carry out the survey work of the undemarcated line between Yunnan and Burma, legally establish boundary markers according to our geography and orientation, and establish necessary border police to restore security. Third, the issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border does not belong to the scope of internal affairs. Statements by officials can easily cause misunderstandings and only increase diplomatic difficulties. In the future, our country should maintain a cautious attitude. Recalling that in the eleventh year of Guangxu, Zeng Jize made a wrong statement on the Yunnan-Burma border while serving as an envoy to Britain and France, which increased the major difficulties in later negotiations. Zeng cannot escape his responsibility, so statements must be made with caution.</p>
<p>The resolution of the outstanding issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border will not be difficult to achieve as long as China and Burma establish diplomatic relations and have open and honest discussions. We are confident that the emerging politicians of Burma are rational and farsighted and, in the course of building a new country, will be able to reciprocate the kindness of their good neighbor!</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Speech</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) When Japan invaded Northeast China on September 18th, Chinese leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek told the world that this was the prelude to the Second World War, but at the time it did not seem to attract the attention of people in the United States and other countries. In order to implement its anti-aggression doctrine, China refused to participate in the Japan-Italian Anti-Comintern Pact, and resisted Japanese aggression alone for as long as four years. Even today, some enlightened people in the United States point out that the Sino-Japanese War was China fighting for the United States in the Far East. When Japan invaded Hainan Island, the Chinese leader again warned the world that this was the prelude to the Pacific War, demanding that the United States stop selling scrap iron and gasoline to Japan and provide China with arms assistance. Although the United States failed to accept China's opinion, China still fulfilled its due responsibility. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted Japan independently. Although the seaports were blockaded and foreign aid was exhausted, the will to resist the enemy was not diminished. Mr. Wu further stated that the current situation of the National Government is almost the same as the experience of September 18th. If the military force of the Chinese Communist Party cannot be defeated, China will become an appendage to international totalitarian politics, and its impact on the peace of the Far East and the world will be threatened. Here, I would like to reiterate what I said earlier: The result of the National Government's efforts over the past twenty years is, first, that China has not been communized; second, that China has not been dominated by Japan. Otherwise, the entire world situation would inevitably be more dangerous than it is today, especially the post-war situation.</p>

<h3>A Journey to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xi Ju</p>
<p>This time, our group of Chinese and foreign journalists, at the invitation of British Airways, was able to revisit Hong Kong after the war. Although the visit was only for three short nights, many impressions surged into our minds, which I can share with readers. The first striking impression, I feel, is that this glittering crown of the British Empire, known as a "six-star" city, when viewed from Kowloon across the sea at night, although still sparkling like a Christmas tree, has lost a significant number of its jewels on the mountaintop. It seems to have faded in color and diminished in glory. This symbolizes everything in Hong Kong today. However, although the crown has faded in color and diminished in glory, it is still a paradise for some people. Before the outbreak of World War II, Hong Kong relied on refugees seeking asylum, creating a distorted boom. In today's postwar era of economic turmoil and political instability, it has become a gold mine for smugglers and a place of refuge or activity for political exiles. At the same time, it remains a haven for Chinese and foreigners seeking high levels of material enjoyment, where they can indulge themselves without dietary restrictions and wear luxurious clothes unavailable elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Empty Houses on the Peak</h3>
<p>The buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon suffered relatively little damage during the war because the Japanese army did not bomb indiscriminately. After the recovery, the British actively repaired them, and by this spring, they had been restored to their former appearance. The destroyed parts that the reporter saw during the war are now almost impossible to find in the urban area. From this, we can see the British ability to rebuild. However, the impression we got when we visited the Peak was completely different. From a distance, the scenery on the mountain is still the same, with Western-style buildings standing majestically amidst the green vegetation. But when we reached the top, we saw that all the houses were dilapidated and empty, without roofs, windows wide open, and deserted ruins. The mountainside used to be a residential area for the British (before the war, higher-ranking Chinese could only live on the mountainside). After the war, Britain suffered deep wounds, and the people lived frugally. Now, the Hong Kong government is still pleading poverty. The number of British people living on the island is far fewer than before, and they are unable to repair the buildings. This time, when the reporter visited Flagstaff Hill, he saw three or four large buildings under construction. As for the mountain roads, they have been completely changed due to destruction by artillery fire, disrepair over the years, and the removal of railings, seats, street lamps, iron pillars, etc., by the Japanese for shipment to Japan. Tourists who visit here are truly filled with mixed emotions. The Hong Kong Island government is now vigorously encouraging residents to build houses and welcoming wealthy Chinese to invest and live on the mountain. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation can provide loans to assist those who can repair these tall buildings, with the aim of restoring the prosperity of the past as soon as possible. This "raising chickens to get eggs" approach has yielded considerable results. In the past, the tram (cable car) to the Peak was crowded with tourists, and business was booming. Now, the carriages are sparsely populated every day, and the company is suffering heavy losses. The British people living on the mountain can now only live in rented houses with ordinary Chinese people, so the "royal" air of the past has been largely eliminated. The way they treat Chinese people is now very different from the past.</p>
<h3>Agreement Signed, Implementation Delayed</h3>
<p>Looking at the current style of the Hong Kong government, it is indeed prioritizing the restoration of past prosperity in every way. It is striving for the stability of residents in terms of living standards, and its policies are now much more open-minded than before the war. Chinese newspapers can freely criticize the Hong Kong government. They are hoping to wash away the appearance of colonialism and achieve genuine cooperation with the Chinese people. It is said that they hope to establish a new institution with Chinese participation in politics next year to create a new style of British colonialism in the Far East. This change in policy, although it has a considerable relationship with the previous proposal by Chinese people to recover Hong Kong, is also due to the fact that the political and economic status of Hong Kong itself is closely related to China. If Hong Kong wants to restore its former appearance, it must cooperate with China in a real way. The recent exchanges between Zhang Fakui, Song Ziwen, Hong Kong Governor Grantham, and British Ambassador Stevenson, and the signing of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, are all concrete manifestations of the active efforts of China and Britain to enhance bilateral relations. Although the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has been formally signed by representatives of both sides and has become a formal international document, the reason for the delay in its implementation is said to be: Hong Kong is an open port without any restrictions. Its prosperity after the war is greatly related to smuggling. If smuggling is cracked down on, smugglers may move to Macau, which would be greatly detrimental to Hong Kong. Once the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement is implemented, it will inevitably establish a fixed exchange rate between the national currency and the Hong Kong dollar. Recently, the Hong Kong dollar has plummeted, and China's currency is experiencing rampant inflation. If an exchange rate is established, not only will the Hong Kong dollar be significantly affected, but also the remittances from overseas Chinese, which are currently centered in Hong Kong, will no longer flow into Hong Kong. Since our country implemented its foreign exchange control policy, the market price of foreign exchange has been adjusted from time to time, but it still cannot keep up with the black market. Therefore, many export goods are smuggled to Hong Kong. However, the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement stipulates that the black market should be cracked down on. Once implemented, the foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai and the foreign exchange settlement in the Maoye area will be about the same. Exporters who used to ship goods to Hong Kong for transshipment will inevitably abandon Hong Kong and choose other ports, which will inevitably cause serious economic losses to Hong Kong. Moreover, Hong Kong was originally a port for the import and export of Chinese goods. The implementation of the new agreement may cause this glittering crown to lose its luster. As a result, its political status will inevitably change accordingly. The British have this inner torment, which is why they are particularly cautious. (Continued on Page Five)</p>

<h3>Four Powers Have Widely Divergent Views on the Future Economic Principles of Germany; Soviet Union Insists on Establishing a Central German Organization First</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Sixth Dispatch] The Foreign Ministers' Conference was unable to decide on a way to deal with the third item on the agenda of this session, namely, the economic principles of the future Germany. Finally, Marshall asked Molotov whether he could submit a specific paper on economic principles on Monday. Molotov did not agree, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The meeting today was chaired by Marshall. After the meeting began, he first suggested using the British basic document on economic principles as a basis for discussion. However, Molotov wanted to use the two documents that recorded the points on which the four powers had failed to reach an agreement on economic principles at the Moscow Conference as the basis for discussion, which was opposed by the other three foreign ministers. In the documents that Molotov insisted on using as the basis for discussion, there were statements such as "the economic institutions of each region, including one or more occupation zones, should be abolished." If this proposal were adopted, the organization of the Anglo-American Combined Zone would inevitably be abolished. Molotov also submitted three documents today, respectively on the level of German industry, the free exchange of materials in various regions, and the opinion on the establishment of a German Ministry of Economy, but none of them were discussed. Molotov's documents stated: "Free Circulation of Materials Nationwide in Germany": After the establishment of the German central organization and the procedures for Germany to fulfill its reparation obligations are stipulated, inter-regional barriers should be abolished, and the free circulation of materials in the four regions should be allowed. The regional economic institutions including one or more occupation zones should be abolished immediately. "Level of German Industry": The German central organization should draft a plan for the rehabilitation of the German economy within the limits of the new industrial level, but Germany's reparation obligations should be fully fulfilled unconditionally. "Central German Organization": The Control Council recognizes the need to rapidly restore German agriculture, industry, transportation, and raise the living standards of the German people within the scope of maintaining security and preventing the restoration of the German military industry, so that Germany can assist in the recovery of Europe and develop German foreign trade. However, Germany's economic recovery depends on the German people themselves being able to implement appropriate measures nationwide. Therefore, a central economic organization organized entirely by Germans should be established to carry out its tasks under the supervision of the four powers. If the measures of the central German organization violate the instructions of the Allied Control Council, the commander of the occupation zone may suspend the implementation of the measures by the German central organization, and then the Allied Control Council will make the final decision.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London Sixth Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault submitted a document to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference last night, clarifying the three main principles that the French government has formulated for the economic foundation of Germany: France firmly insists that the restoration of Germany should not have priority over the economic restoration of the Allied countries. France hopes to establish a special government in the Ruhr, the center of German mineral production, in order to meet the necessary conditions for security. The issue of reparations cannot be separated from the issue of security. France believes that we can distribute a large number of non-essential machinery and equipment in Germany to Allied countries that have suffered from the war, in order to limit Germany's industrial potential. Germany must make every effort to prevent it from continuing to become a burden on the occupying countries and must balance its international balance of payments with its resources. France does not object to Germany being a single economic entity, including the Ruhr and Rhineland, but France has always believed that Saar constitutes an integral part of the French economic and monetary area.</p>
<h3>Soviet Intentions Clearly Revealed; Aims to Destroy the Economic Organization of the Anglo-American Zone and Prevent Germany from Participating in the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Sixth Dispatch] Molotov's unwillingness to allow Germany to establish any kind of economic partnership with the Western powers has now been openly stated. Molotov's proposals on German economic principles only involve general principles, while the three foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France want Molotov to provide opinions on specific issues. Molotov's purpose is nothing more than the following two points: To systematically destroy the economic organization of the Anglo-American zone in Germany; To prevent Germany from participating in the Marshall Plan for European aid, either in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Molotov proposed to exchange the abolition of the economic institutions of each region for Germany's payment of the reparations demanded by the Soviet Union and the free exchange of materials in the four zones of Germany. In addition, Molotov also advocated the immediate establishment of a German central administrative structure. He believed that preparations for the establishment of a German central government should be made. After the establishment of these two governments, regardless of whether they are temporary in nature, Molotov will be prepared to establish a German central organization. However, its specific form and nature have not yet been clearly stated by Molotov. The intention of the Soviet Union is to rapidly concentrate economic power in the hands of the Germans in accordance with the way the Soviet Union wants, but at the same time, it allows the commanders of each region to hold broad powers to formulate economic systems within their jurisdictions. The latter can prevent the excessive expansion of the rights of the German central organization or prevent the development of the German economy in a way that is not approved by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>German Leftists Elect Representatives; Prepare to Go to London to Present Their Views to the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin Seventh Dispatch] The German People's Congress has elected a delegation of seventeen people to go to London to represent the German people at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The delegation is led by the Communists Pieck and Grotewohl. The seventeen people are composed of representatives from the following groups: the Socialist Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, the Communists in the Western Occupation Zone, the German Women's Association, trade unions, missionary societies, associations of victims of fascism, and the German youth movement. A large-scale demonstration parade was originally planned to be held on Unter den Linden Avenue on the afternoon of the seventh, but it was canceled due to inclement weather. The demands carried by the representatives include: the organization of a German central government, all democratic parties must have representatives, the central government should be able to attend the peace conference to make a statement, and sign the peace treaty. The German people hope that the National Congress will hold elections by secret ballot, and the National Congress will ratify the peace treaty after it is signed.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Advocates Stopping Shipments to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington Sixth Dispatch] Republican Congressman Weichel, chairman of the House Merchant Marine Committee, told reporters today that he advocated stopping all exports to the Soviet Union if necessary to cut off supplies to the main enemy country. The House Merchant Marine Committee is investigating the Soviet Union's use of ships built in the United States. Weichel said: According to the Export Control Act, President Truman still has the power to restrict exports to the Soviet Union, but the president does not seem to want to fully utilize this power. As far as he knows, agricultural products and machinery are still being shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union in large quantities. If this is not stopped immediately, he will ask the Merchant Marine Committee to pass legislation to prohibit any ships from carrying materials from American ports to the Soviet Union or countries ruled by the Soviet Union.</p>

It is also said that the crisis can be overcome around December 15. National Economy Minister Mey broadcast that the government has a new wage and price plan that will take effect by the end of the month. Mey said that the new measures will be implemented after consultation with various social and economic organizations. The government wants to hear the opinions of various organizations. Mey declared that the government and the General Confederation of Labor have reached an agreement on all possible solutions, but the government has not yet agreed on two points. These two points are: Strikers should be paid wages for the days of work lost due to the strike; The government guarantees that the French franc will no longer inflate.</p>

<h3>Power Outage at the 16th Pier Last Night, Bureau Chief Gave Instructions in Person, Brightness Restored Immediately</h3>
<p>The problem of power outages in the southern city is of great concern to all parties. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, made a special trip to inspect Zhaojiabang Road, Dengyun Road, the 16th Pier, Zhonghua Road, and Xujiahui last night around 5:00 PM. When Zhao arrived in the southern city, the power supply everywhere was normal. However, at around 6:00 PM, the power supply in the Yimiao District and the 16th Pier area was suddenly cut off. After Zhao personally went to the Huashang Electric Company on Chezhan Road to inspect the power generation situation of the company, he found that the company's power generation had already reached its maximum load. Except for the Yimiao District, which was originally cut off for line maintenance and should be temporarily suspended, the current in the 16th Pier area was due to the surge in demand from factories after several days of power outages. The power for the factories should have been stopped during the exchange of electricity for large lights at around 5:00 or 6:00 PM, but some factories failed to comply, resulting in a sudden increase in the company's load. As a last resort, the power supply to the 16th Pier area was temporarily suspended. After Zhao instructed the company personnel to transfer part of the power to electricity users, the 16th Pier area was restored to brightness at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Insufficient Power Supply Prompts Increased Equipment</p>
<p>According to Zhao, the total power supply for the entire southern city, based on the current situation, requires 10,000 kilowatts. The current power generation of the Huashang Electric Company is 6,600 kilowatts, plus 1,400 kilowatts from the Longhua Cement Plant, which is only 8,000 kilowatts, still short of 2,000 kilowatts. Zhao is urging the company to increase its equipment to make up for the company's total load. In addition, Zhao has scheduled to convene the person in charge of the company this afternoon to study strategies to make up for this power shortage.</p>

<h3>Building Charity Sale Houses, Awaiting Discussion on Material Purchase Issues, Surveyed Six Base Sites Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Ma Shaoquan, Chairman of the Real Estate Industry Association, Zhou Haoquan, Executive Director, He Zhifu, Secretary of the City Bank, Xi Mingguang, Commissioner of the Land Administration Bureau, and others, inspected the construction sites for the city's winter relief charity sale houses yesterday morning. There are three sites on Dunchin Road in Minhang, one site on Daxi Road, and two sites on Linsen West Road, totaling more than 15 mu, which is more than enough land required to build 100 houses. Therefore, the best sites will be selected based on their location, environment, and transportation conditions. Further discussions will continue in the next day or two, and a decision will be made after consulting with Mayor Wu. The civil land is provided by the real estate industry, and the price is lower than the market price. The Winter Relief Association will buy it at a price offered. In addition, there is a public land site of more than two mu on Yuyuan Road, which Director Zhu and others also inspected yesterday morning. Because it is not very suitable for the required construction conditions, it is planned to abandon it. The construction sketches of the charity sale houses have been designed by the Bureau of Public Works, and they are awaiting approval at a meeting. As soon as the construction site and drawings are officially determined, bids will be invited for construction, and the project will be completed within three months after construction begins. Director Zhu and others have also scheduled to convene the persons in charge of the six trade associations related to construction, including hardware, steel, cement, sand and gravel, bricks and tiles, and wood industry, at the City Chamber of Commerce tomorrow afternoon to discuss the issue of purchasing materials.</p>
<h3>Third China-America Flight to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning from the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The third China-America flight of China National Aviation Corporation took off from San Francisco the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Liu Jingyi, General Manager of the company, who attended the International Aviation Conference in the United States, is returning to China on this flight.</p>
<h3>City Councilors Visit Wusong Gas Plant, Production Increases Daily, Economic Difficulties, Plan to Expand Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Wusong Gas Plant in Shanghai was established after reorganizing enemy property in 1945 and is directly under the Public Utilities Bureau. In the early days of the takeover, the buildings in the factory were full of holes. After the factory employees repaired them, they officially resumed supply on New Year's Day of the following year. The results have been good in the past two years, and the daily output has reached 800,000 cubic feet. In response to the recommendations of the responsible persons of the Public Utilities Group of the City Council, the plant specially invited City Councilors Wang Zhuyi, He Yuanming, Jiang Hao, Qu Yue, Wang Ziyang, Li Wenjie, Wang Jian'e, and others to visit the Wusong plant yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to see the gas production situation. Zhang Rentao, Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also accompanied them. Xu Baojun, Director of the plant, reported on the progress of its business, stating that: Initially, the gas supply area was limited to a corner of the city center, with few users and difficulties in promotion. Later, due to the insufficient supply from the British Shanghai Gas Company, the plant supplied gas. Initially, it was only 100,000 cubic feet per day, and then increased to 450,000 cubic meters. Although the Wusong Gas Plant has only been around for eight or nine years, it is not impossible to compete with the Shanghai Gas Company, which has a history of 70 or 80 years, in terms of business. It is only because of</p>
<p>Economic Difficulties</p>
<p>That it has not been fully developed. Because the machinery and equipment of the plant were pieced together by the Japanese in those years, reducing labor and saving materials, and were also damaged by bombing and shocks, the service life will inevitably be reduced if they are not repaired immediately. The plant has now prepared a next year's expansion plan: Increase the construction of mechanical gas generators to increase production. Orders have been placed in the United States, and they can be shipped by the end of next year, at an estimated cost of 2.5 billion national currency. Increase the construction of tar separators. Orders have been placed in the United Kingdom, and they can be shipped by the end of next year, at an estimated cost of 300 million national currency. Add eight-inch high-pressure pipes so that the increased gas volume can be directly sent to the gas storage tank of the Shanghai Gas Company. An application has been submitted to the Relief Administration for allocation, and it is estimated that it will cost about 3 billion national currency. Add a 500-foot deep well, which will cost about 1 billion national currency. According to Deputy Director Zhang, the municipal government has</p>
<p>Total Investment</p>
<p>Up to now, the amount is 1 billion yuan. At that time, it cost 600 million yuan to buy machines from the enemy and puppet property office, and 300 million yuan for the land. Therefore, the economic situation is very difficult, just like getting through the New Year every day. Therefore, in order to seek business development, economic assistance must be given. After the councilors visited yesterday, they unanimously agreed that its future is very promising. Qu Yue also said: I hope that everyone in Shanghai will have gas in the future, and I hope that the colleagues of the Wusong Gas Plant can seek benefits for all citizens.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhigang, Who Murdered by Relying on Enemy Power, Was Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Jiang Zhigang, who was accused of murdering and robbing by using the power of the enemy and puppet regime, has been prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for the crime of banditry. Zhao Chongjiu, Liu Rongsheng, Jiang, and others from Yixing transported 200 dan of medium-cooked rice in 1944 to Wuxi for profit. At that time, Jiang was working in the enemy and puppet organs. He used the power of the enemy and puppet regime to rob the rice on the way the rice boat was traveling under the guise of inspecting the boat, and killed Qian Changzhao, who was escorting the rice. At that time, Zhao Chongjiu and others had no way to appeal in the occupied area. After the victory, Jiang secretly came to Shanghai and hid at No. 9 Wanxiangli, Avenue Edward VII. The victim found out and reported it to the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau. After being detained and sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation, he was prosecuted according to law.</p>

<h3>Air Transport of Large Amounts of Poisons, Six Criminals Arrested One After Another, Confessed That They Only Knew It Was "Rhinoceros Yellow", Three Months Ago They Helped Unload Once and Received Remuneration of More Than 40 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Longhua Police Sub-bureau received a report from Police Inspector Li Kaixi, stationed at Longhua Airport, stating that China National Aviation Corporation's Flight No. 47, which flew from Pi to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai at around 4:00 PM on the third of last month. When inspecting several pieces of luggage at around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 25th, it was found that two packages of smuggled goods were hidden in the tail of the plane. After the person in charge of the company took them away for inspection, it was said that they were opium and heroin, weighing about 60 kilograms. They have now been sent to customs, etc. After hearing this, Sub-bureau Chief Pan Jing ordered Section Chief Guo Jitian to instruct Section Members Guo Zhikai, Zhu Enyan, and Yang Ming to start investigating. Finally, on the 25th, reliable clues were obtained, and it was found that Shi, a mechanical worker at the airport, had conspired with the local police bureau to arrest the suspect at his home east of Qiaozhen and take him back for interrogation. According to his confession: On the afternoon of November 3, someone named Gu told me that Flight No. 47 was carrying smuggled goods such as rhino yellow and asked me to</p>
<p>Find a Way to Take It Down</p>
<p>Send it to Room 206 on the second floor of No. 587 Jing'an Temple Road. That night, I tried to find a way for him, but the cargo was too large to carry out. On the morning of the fourth, the company discovered it, and I immediately went to Room 506 of the Datong Hotel, which Gu had opened, to inform him. According to Gu, these two packages of smuggled goods were not illegal items and still told me to find out the news every day. On the 11th, I saw in the newspaper that the items seized by the company were all opium drugs. In addition, three months ago, Sun Shougao had asked me to take private goods for Gu once, a total of four small packages. It was said that they were also rhino yellow. At that time, I asked Wei Wenxiang to</p>
<p>Help Carry It Out</p>
<p>Took it to the dormitory in Dapu Bridge. The next day, Sun Shougao and Gu took it away, and Sun paid me a reward of 15 million yuan, and I gave Wei Wenxiang 8 million yuan. So, I suspected that the previous items were also opium drugs. I panicked for a while, and then discussed with Sun Shougao, Wei Wenxiang, etc. On the 10th, I took my family back to Chongming to avoid the disaster temporarily. At that time, I saw Nie Chengshan asking Gu for</p>
<p>Nine Gold Bars</p>
<p>And so on. Then, Section Member Guo went to the airport to arrest technician Sun Shougao, who confessed that three months ago, Gu had asked me to take out four small packages of private goods from the plane. It was said that they were rhino yellow brought from Kunming. I was asked to send two packages to Gu's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, and I received a reward of 20 million yuan. The other two packages were instructed to be sent to Yin Liangchen at No. 5 Yu Ye Li, Linsen Middle Road, and I also received a reward of 10 million yuan. After the police officers rushed to the address and arrested Yin Liangchen and Nie Chengshan, they confessed to their accomplices Lu Huiming and Zhuang Zhongfu. After many days of pursuit, the aforementioned criminal Lu, etc., were arrested the day before yesterday. This case has been completely investigated. It is believed that the crimes of the six criminals, Shi, etc., are serious, and it has been decided to submit them to the District Court for punishment this morning.</p>
<h3>Labor Daily Necessities to Be Distributed by Cooperatives, The Social Bureau Urges Factories to Organize Cooperatives As Soon As Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to improve the lives of workers and promote labor-management coordination, the Social Bureau is actively promoting the establishment of consumer cooperatives in various factories. There are three organizational methods: Organize a consumer cooperative independently by a factory if the number of workers in the factory reaches 200. Divide by region, and small factories on nearby roads jointly organize a consumer cooperative. Taking the industry as a delay, in addition to the separate organization of large factories, small factories in the same industry in the city jointly establish a consumer cooperative. According to the Social Bureau, a total of 80 factory cooperatives can be established within the year, including more than 200 factories. From next year, the government will allocate factories to organize as soon as possible. It is stipulated that those who have not established them by the end of January next year will suspend their right to allocate items temporarily. As for the organization of the cooperative, both labor and management participate in it. The management recognizes the promotion shares, and the manager is selected by the board of directors.</p>
<p>After the organization of the cooperatives in various factories has come to an end, the Social Bureau will organize a joint federation of cooperatives in various factories throughout the city on a bald top. In addition to managing the items allocated by the government, it will also manage other daily necessities, directly to the factories that produce leather goods, and distribute them uniformly, so that workers can reduce the burden. The other tasks of the federation include education, publicity, and other work. All factory cooperatives and federations will be supervised and guided by the Social Bureau in the future.</p>

<p>Lin Fengmian's Painting Thought Embodies the Renaissance</p>
<p>In Lin Fengmian's thirty-year painting career, this decade of silence holds special significance. During this time, he never held a single exhibition. While many fashionable artists were exceptionally active, he remained silent, like an ancient prophet, quietly seeking his truth in the desert. His immortal paintings, styles, and tones, after this decade of absolute struggle, are now finally presented to us for the first time, the abundant harvest he reaped in the desert.</p>
<p>Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, for the past few centuries, due to the prevalence of Neo-Confucianism, Chinese thought has consistently emphasized rationality while suppressing instinct (the so-called "upholding heavenly principles and curbing human desires"). The arid atmosphere of absolute asceticism permeated Chinese culture, preventing lively, instinctive emotions from rising to the fore. This tendency to destroy basic human nature was reflected in painting through the popularity of literati painting and the pursuit of mystical, rational realms. Consequently, emptiness, tranquility, and solemnity became paramount, with as little flavor of the human world as possible.</p>
<p>The fundamental characteristic of the Chinese Renaissance must inevitably be</p>
<p>the rediscovery of "man" and the re-emergence of human nature. The stimulus for the revival of modern Chinese art, on the one hand, was certainly classical Greek and Han-Tang art, but more importantly, it was the entirety of art following the Western Renaissance. Only the humanist thought of the West since the Renaissance can rescue the emptiness and aridity of Chinese art in recent centuries. The non-worldly aspects of painting must be based on the worldly to be complete. The ultimate ethereal must be achieved from a vigorous corporeal starting point. True transcendence and emptiness can only be achieved through the real existence of nature and human nature as a source. Here, Lin Fengmian is the first person in modern China to boldly accept the entirety of modern Western humanist thought, use it as a foundation, and then use a completely new gaze to view the East, select from the East, and finally return to the East.</p>
<p>Seeing a New Era</p>
<p>To view Lin Fengmian's paintings, one must penetrate their beautiful exterior and go straight into the depths behind the beauty, capturing the profound core ideas and core emotions. His focus is clearly not on the pursuit of pure formal beauty, but rather on establishing a brand-new belief in the culture of tomorrow, a philosophy of life for tomorrow, and, as the primary foundation of both, the "feeling of tomorrow." Because of this, some decorative, aesthetic works, initially appealing, become increasingly fragile the more one looks at them. These beauties are not enduring. The formal beauty of Lin Fengmian's paintings is underpinned by a profound set of life ideas, so they are solid, durable, and increasingly rewarding to contemplate. His paintings are not just paintings; they are prophecies of the era. In his paintings, we can see a new era, a new human nature, a new cultural essence, and, more importantly, a brand-new "feeling of tomorrow" that serves as the overall foundation for the aforementioned three. If the paintings of the Renaissance masters foreshadowed the tendencies of the European cultural spirit in recent centuries, then Lin Fengmian's female figures, although they are still constantly experimenting and developing, have already begun to depict, to some extent, the spiritual countenance of the future Chinese Renaissance (which is also the beginning of the world Renaissance). Lin Fengmian's paintings (mainly female figures) bring us hope, light, and optimism. In the history of Chinese painting, the significance of Lin Fengmian's ability to occupy a unique high peak lies here. If his painting were merely a revolution in form, it would only be a tributary of the times and would never have become such a major force.</p>
<p>Unique Achievements in Line</p>
<p>Lin Fengmian's achievements in line are almost unprecedented. Before him, no Chinese painter had ever dared to transform lines so boldly. For the past few centuries, painters have been circling within traditional conventions, unlike the ancients who directly delved into nature and observed nature. Although lines were intended to imitate the ethereal spirit of the ancients, they lacked the basic sense of life evoked by delving into nature. As a result, they became increasingly empty and fragile, becoming either imperfect copies of ancient paintings or imperfect copies of copies. These fragile, thin, and stiff lines, through Lin Fengmian's decades of hard work and struggle, were transformed for the first time, revived, enriched, and restored to the scale and vitality they had a thousand years ago. His lines are so unique precisely because he absorbed the essence of oil paint. He is the first person of his time to dissolve the flavor of Western oil paint into Chinese ink, which is why his lines are so charming, solid, spirited, and rich.</p>
<p>The porcelain-like exquisiteness, harmony, and dexterity of Lin Fengmian's female figure paintings are not only the result of his influence from Song porcelain but are also clearly the crystallization of extreme inspiration. Due to the strong ink absorption of xuan paper and the quick-drying nature of ink, these paintings must be painted extremely quickly. The painter must undergo intense patience, forge a high degree of passion, and, in a state of white-hot spirit, use his skilled experience with lines and colors to capture the highest spiritual spark onto the paper in a flash. In creating these paintings, not a single stroke can be flawed (oil paintings are built up). When viewing those female figures, I often have the feeling of watching lightning at night, especially those ink paintings with few colors, where the dark clothes set off the extremely bright face, giving people a lightning-like sense of brightness, as well as a high degree of pleasure, tranquility, beauty, and wisdom. In Cézanne's landscapes, due to those axe-split, emotionally charged lines and wonderful combinations, the same lightning flashes, a harmonious sense of clarity and wisdom.</p>
<p>Deliberate and Refined Pursuit for Thirty Years</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the works at the highest peak of art history are always the crystallization of extremely balanced emotion and reason. Only such works are exquisite, solid, ethereal, and healthy, a harmonious combination of spirit and flesh. Lin Fengmian, however, only began to achieve this after thirty years of hard work and deliberate pursuit. He is desperately strengthening it, developing it, making it even clearer, richer, more solid, and more mature.</p>
<p>Lin Fengmian strives to pursue the ideal tools of Greek beauty with two things: one is the humanism of the Western Renaissance, and the other is the naturalism of Eastern Lao Zhuang. The spirit of his paintings is clearly a fusion of these two different thoughts, and the artistic spirit expressed after this fusion not only symbolizes the spirit of future new painting but also symbolizes the basic spirit of the emerging world culture after the fusion of Eastern and Western cultures. Lin Fengmian has gone through more than thirty years of struggle. The struggle of the past thirty years is over. This should only be the preparation for another thirty years of his struggle. In this new thirty-year struggle, we hope that he will snatch the most eternal and immortal truth from the deepest part of the Palace of Truth and throw it onto his paintings, not only to open the eyes of the Chinese art world but, more importantly, to open the eyes of the world art world as well.

<h3>The Manager of Maochang Company Talks About Maochang's Eyeglasses</h3>
<p>Not long ago, news came from the American medical community that American ophthalmologists could cure blind people who had been blind for many years, restoring their sight. The other day, I received a letter from an elderly blind person in a distant place, asking me to inquire in Shanghai about the truth of this news. Motivated by this, yesterday, the reporter specially visited Zhang Deqian, the optometry expert and deputy manager of Maochang Eyeglasses Company.</p>
<p>His answer was quite disappointing for my blind relative in the distance. Regarding the current situation of ophthalmology in the American medical community, he said, "No one in the United States or other countries has yet researched a method that can completely restore sight to a blind person." Then he said, "There is also no way to cure nearsightedness to this day." Because the tunic of the eyeball is composed of tightly knit fibrous tissue, once the eyeball develops nearsightedness, the tunic tissue softens, elongates, and thins. If one wants to return the position of the tunic to the focal point formed by the incident light, it is an impossible thing. Fortunately, although nearsightedness cannot be cured, it is possible to find ways to slow down its deepening. These methods, in addition to improving school hygiene and popularizing optical knowledge, include wearing accurate eyeglasses, all of which can help alleviate the suffering of nearsightedness. Regarding whether wearing accurate eyeglasses is effective in slowing down the speed of nearsightedness, he said: Anyone with experience believes this to be true.</p>
<p>He led the reporter to visit the manufacturing department upstairs. Thousands of workers were buried in configuring, from polishing rouge to grinding gray sand, lenses, and frames. Almost all are imported goods. Imported goods require foreign exchange, and everyone knows the difficulty of settling foreign exchange today. Therefore, their import of raw materials has become a major problem. Obstacles in ship traffic have meant that their orders in the United States last year have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Funds are frozen, and business development is indirectly hindered. General Manager Hu Gengpei said: Maochang's brand name, MC, is very famous in the "eyeglasses class" in South America, Singapore, the East Indies, and various European countries. That is to say, the precision of their business and products can compete with the United States and remain ahead of various countries in the Far East. Several famous American eyeglasses companies, AO, Baixuelong, Peisidan, COC, Martin, and Rogers, are all Maochang's specially appointed or exclusive dealers in China. Because raw materials are not easy to import, exports are affected, and the foreign markets are now being taken away by others.</p>
<p>Speaking of their MC brand name, which is engraved on the side of the lens and is so subtle that it is not easy to see, there is an interesting story. Last year, a soldier came to Shanghai from Guilin and said that the Maochang branch in Guilin had made a mistake in the degree of the nearsighted glasses they had configured for him, and he asked for a re-examination and a new configuration. They told the soldier that other than the head office in Shanghai, there was only one branch in Nanjing, and the "Maochang" eyeglasses company in Guilin was a counterfeit. Upon inspection of the side of the lens, there was indeed no MC brand name. However, they still gave the soldier a free eye exam and configured another pair for him.</p>
<p>Before the war, when Pan Gongzhan was the director of the city's education bureau, in view of the fact that students' poor eyesight was affecting their studies, he negotiated with the company to provide free eye exams for students in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the city, and to provide eyeglasses on an obligatory basis at a special price. After the war, encouraged by the hygiene educator Zhou Shang, the company still configured eyeglasses for students at a price of 50,000 yuan per pair. In order to maintain the lowest cost, the price was recently raised to 80,000 yuan per pair. Speaking of their providing free eye exams for customers, it has attracted dissatisfaction from their peers. It is said that several companies charge as much as one million yuan for eye exams, which they believe is an irrational exorbitant charge. For social service and to meet universal needs, they first decided to provide free eye exams. They also only maintain the lowest profit in terms of price.</p>

Therefore, they refused to unload and wholesale goods the day before yesterday as a protest against UNRRA and had no other purpose. It officially resumed operations yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Unfilial Son Returns to Fei, Talking to Our Reporter About Escaping Danger and Creation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hefei, 6th] Xiang Kaiyan, also known as "Unfilial Student of Pingjiang", who served as a Major General Secretary in the 21st Army Group Headquarters in Dabie Mountain during the War of Resistance, and is famous for his novels "The Strange Heroes of the Jianghu" and "Unofficial History of Studying in the East", was captured after the bandits occupied Lihuang on September 2nd. The news spread, and the cultural circles were holding their breath. Now Xiang has escaped danger and arrived in Fei, converting to the Mingjiao Temple, the only ancient temple in Anhui located in the East Street of the city. In recent days, many people from cultural circles have visited him. Mr. Xiang, with white beard and a bald head, is full of spirit and talks eloquently about his experience as a prisoner, which has become what the cultural circles at home are happy to hear. A special report is as follows:</p>
<p>Captured and Imprisoned in Xiangshan Temple</p>
<p>After the victory, Mr. Xiang, because he was infatuated with Indian Buddhism and indifferent to fame and wealth, resolutely resigned from his military position, focused on research, and wrote a long novel based on historical materials from the early Qing Dynasty to the present, spanning more than 300 years. It is estimated that it will reach 2 million words, titled "Unofficial History of the Revolution", to supplement the shortcomings of official history. At that time, the provincial government, in order to commemorate the late Chairman Liao Yannong (of the founding) and the generals and soldiers who sacrificed for the country, decided to build Liao Gong Ancestral Hall, Loyalty Memorial Shrine, and Victory Memorial Tower in Lihuang, the root location of the Dabie Mountains, and asked Mr. Xiang to stay in the mountains to supervise the construction. Mr. Xiang could not refuse these three major projects and stayed in Xiangshan Temple in front of Liao Gong's tomb. Before the wood project was completed, on September 2nd, with a thunderbolt, the bandits sneaked into Lihuang. On the 3rd, Mr. Xiang was captured by the bandits to the headquarters in Gubeichong, ten miles away, and became a prisoner.</p>
<p>Answering Interrogation at Gubeichong</p>
<p>The next day, he was interrogated about his name by the so-called Minister of Administration, Shi Zirong, etc. Mr. Xiang stated it frankly. Shi and others showed respect. They asked if he had ever studied books by Mao Zedong, Guo Moruo, Lu Xun, etc.? He replied: I have not read books after the Tang and Song dynasties. Asked what he thought of the Communist Army? He replied: Before gaining political power, you abuse policies, only to attract hatred from the people. Moreover, you stubbornly defend the barren Lihuang, and in the future, if you don't freeze to death, you will also starve to death. Shi and others were silent for a long time after hearing this. Later, they asked, would you like to go to Jiamusi to be an instructor? He replied: I have never read books of the Marx type. If you teach me the good plays of Laozi, Zhuangzi, the Four Books, and the Five Classics, I'm afraid it won't be to your taste.</p>
<p>Writing Unofficial History in Mingjiao Temple</p>
<p>The bandits knew that he could not be subdued and placed Mr. Xiang under house arrest for eight days, confiscating his clothes, books, etc. They said to Mr. Xiang: Based on the principle of not killing the virtuous, you can leave at your convenience. Mr. Xiang then escaped from the tiger's mouth and returned to the temple. In the debris, he retrieved the incomplete manuscripts of "Party Life Unofficial History", the crystallization of his years of hard work. After more than a month of sorting and supplementing, one night, in a dark and windy time, he wore a gray cotton robe, waded through water, climbed mountains, left the red circle of terror, and arrived in Hefei, the provincial capital. According to Mr. Xiang, he is still writing 8,000 words of the unfinished "Unofficial History of the Revolution" every day in the incense-filled smoke. Once it is completed and published, he will wear bamboo sandals and return to his lovely hometown of Pingjiang, Hunan.</p>
<h3>Rewards Offered for the Capture of a Leopard and a Tiger</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th) The Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, and Yangzhou Counties Clearing Command has launched a full-scale clearing operation against the remaining bandits in its jurisdiction. Now it is offering rewards of 20 million yuan to inform on and capture bandit leaders Zhao Wenbao and Nie Laohu. At the same time, it issued a brief announcement of the clearing: During the clearing period, all troops and public forces should cooperate and work together, regardless of regional boundaries, and strive to advance the clearing. County, district, township, bao, and jia heads and local gentry should lead the public to fight against the bandits. Those who dare to collude with bandits, hide bandits, let bandits go, conceal bandits, or collect bandit grain on their behalf will be executed by firing squad. Those who report bandits, secretly report bandit information, and automatically kill bandits will be heavily rewarded.</p>
<h3>Zhou Zhongda Happily Recovers His Belongings, Zheng Taiqiu Painfully Suffers Interrogation: The First Attempt to Steal Failed on the Spot</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 6th) Zhou Zhongyuan, a cloth merchant from Yangzhou, carried 49 million yuan in cash on the night of the 4th to travel from Zhenjiang to Shanghai by night express military train to remit funds. Near Suzhou, because he was tired from the journey, he temporarily closed his eyes to rest. Suddenly, he discovered that the leather bag storing the money under his seat was missing. In a panic, he got off the military train and reported to the road police at the Suzhou military station. Upon inspection of the passengers on the military train, a young thief was fortunately caught on the spot, and the leather bag with the cash was recovered. According to the thief, named Zheng Taiqiu, it was his first time stealing. He is currently being interrogated by the police's second branch.</p>

<h3>Will Hong Kong Become the "Eastern Reno"? "Miss Shanghai" Causes a Scene with a Disheveled Divorce</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 4th] These days in Hong Kong, "Miss" seems to always be associated with bad luck, attracting trouble. Shanghai's Miss Xie Jiahua, who doesn't cause problems elsewhere, comes to Hong Kong and puts on a show that is more realistic and exciting than a movie. It is reported in the newspapers and said by people that Miss Xie came to Hong Kong to film a movie under contract with Dachung British Film Company, but who knew that she was actually using this as an opportunity to leave her husband!</p>
<p>Yesterday, her husband, Rong Meixin, rushed to Hong Kong from Shanghai. Miss Xie personally went to the airport to greet him! The two crossed the sea together to the scenic Repulse Bay Hotel. There, the two got into a fight, and the hotel authorities "evicted" them. Miss Xie then ran towards the Great China Dormitory in Kowloon across the harbor, with her hair disheveled and crying all the way. It is said that Miss Xie has telegraphed her mother in Shanghai to come to Hong Kong, determined to get a divorce from Rong Meixin. Hong Kong people have given Rong Meixin the title of "Paint King," in contrast to Xie Jiahua's "Miss Shanghai." This story has opened a new scene for the idle class in Hong Kong, which is already quite lively.</p>
<p>It is remembered that not long ago, Yang Xiuqiong also traveled all the way from Shanghai back to Hong Kong to formally file for divorce, coinciding with the formal divorce of "Miss Hong Kong" Wu Danfeng on the same day! It is said that a Shanghai lawyer named Yu Xiangzhen came to Hong Kong at the same time as King Rong—in due time, this small island in the south may very well become the "Reno of the East"!

<h3>A Trip to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 2) Amidst the frequent exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland China, there is also the issue of relocating residents of Kowloon City, which is a matter of public concern. Around the time I arrived in Hong Kong, this issue was causing a lot of uproar, and various newspapers were actively reporting on it. The Hong Kong Government's Public Works Department issued a notice on the 27th of last month, giving over two thousand residents two weeks to move out. Their reason is based on the regulations of the Public Land Rights Ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong Government, which states that the Public Works Department has the right to order the evacuation of residents or any buildings erected on this land and to demolish such buildings if they do not comply. The Chinese government, on the other hand, believes that the core of the issue lies in the sovereignty over the administration of Kowloon City. It is the third time that the Hong Kong government has asked the residents of the city to move. There was a similar incident in the summer of 1933, but because the area of the city was small, the population sparse, and Guangdong Province did not usually establish officials to govern it, and the Hong Kong authorities also considered the Sino-British treaties, it was not enforced later. Currently, Special Commissioner Guo Dehua of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has gone to Beijing to seek instructions on this matter and has begun negotiations with the Hong Kong government. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly has also risen to discuss methods of support and negotiation. During my stay in Hong Kong, when discussing this case with Chinese residents, everyone paid close attention to it, advocating that the government should fight for justice based on reason. Eight years of war have greatly enhanced the political awareness of Chinese residents in Hong Kong, and they are no longer as indifferent as they used to be. This point is commendable and worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Smuggling and Gold Rush Each Display Their Abilities</p>
<p>Based on what I saw and heard during this trip, I feel that the issue of smuggling is still extremely serious. The shops on Hong Kong Island are stacked with goods, and customers are crowded. The bustling scene is in no way inferior to that before the war. Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road Central are mostly occupied by foreign goods stores selling clothing materials, department stores, and so on. The store's flower colors are various and beautiful, with many items, the United States and the United Kingdom may not be able to buy, but in Hong Kong, they are everywhere. Woolen cloth, wool, fabrics and other clothing materials are of good quality and cheap. High-quality women's woolen cloth costs 25 Hong Kong dollars and can be bought much better than 1.3 to 1.4 million in Shanghai. Wool vests are priced from ten to twenty dollars. High-grade nylon stockings sell for seven to eleven Hong Kong dollars. Cosmetics are also very cheap. It is no wonder that smugglers regard Hong Kong as a gold mine. In addition, clock exchange shops and fountain pen sales are everywhere. The price is about one-half or one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. Most of the people walking on the street and negotiating prices in the shops are travelers from various places handling goods. I personally saw a middle-aged woman buying six or seven watches worth tens of millions from a watch shop, discussing the price of watches in Shanghai with a friend sitting next to her, obviously buying them to prepare for business. The hawkers on the street and the waiters in the tea rooms, when they pull out the pens from their pockets to write, are all dazzling Parker type 51 fountain pens. These days, Christmas is approaching, and the shops are all decorated with lights and colors, showing great courtesy to customers, offering cigarettes and gifts, hoping to attract more business. However, during my strolls, I discovered something worthy of attention, which is that any kind of American goods are not much cheaper than in Shanghai. So I asked an old Hong Kong resident, who replied, "This is the specialty of the British! After American goods are loaded into the warehouse, it is always difficult to get them out, and sometimes even a price limit must be set before they are allowed to be sold..." This made me understand the inside story. In addition, I also received a negative answer to the widespread rumor that Japanese goods were selling well in Hong Kong. Because, at least when I was walking around, I had never seen Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Easy to Earn, Generous in Spending</p>
<p>Speaking of the lives of ordinary residents, due to</p>
<p>On Flagstaff Hill in Hong Kong, there are houses without people, while in bustling areas, there are people without houses. This phenomenon shows a strong contrast! (Photographed and Sent by Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Xi Ju)</p>
<p>Because the currency is stable and price fluctuations are small, it seems that everyone is living a stable life. Everyone is dressed quite neatly, and walking around does not have the tense state of striving for survival like people in Shanghai. The Cantonese tea rooms are filled with tea drinkers all day long. In high-end restaurants, female attendants are still dressed up flamboyantly. The sound of mahjong can be heard all over the street. I asked a female attendant how much she earns each month, and she replied that it was about eight hundred to one thousand yuan. I also asked a male attendant, and he said that he could also earn about four hundred yuan a month. However, among these high-end diners, there are fewer Cantonese and Hong Kong people, and most of them are Shanghai buyers who "earn easily and spend generously." I stayed in Hong Kong for four days, and we were worried about food and accommodation every day, because eating and drinking are really shockingly expensive, almost ten times higher than in Shanghai. A reporter ordered a small bowl of shrimp fried rice and paid nearly four Hong Kong dollars. Three reporters went to Jianguo Restaurant once and only ate a set meal of three dishes and one soup, and the bill was more than thirty Hong Kong dollars, which is equivalent to about one million national currency. Hotels are also expensive, costing about thirty Hong Kong dollars per day. This is why travelers say, "Chang'an is good, but it cannot be lived in for long."</p>
<p>Frequent Transportation, Fines for Spitting</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, Hong Kong has become an air transport center, with as many as eleven or twelve international airlines on the ground floor to the left of the Peninsula Hotel. Ships arrive and depart every day, making it more convenient than during the war. The prosperity of Hong Kong is built on the foundation of transportation. Speaking of urban transportation, it is still as well-organized as before. Streetcars start at one dollar and five cents, public buses cost three cents regardless of distance, trams cost two cents first class and one cent third class, and ferries cost two cents first class and one cent third class. In addition to transportation, general municipal administration seems to be more advanced than in the past. Residents believe that the Hong Kong government enforces the law strictly, and the British can lead by example, so they can abide by the law everywhere. Whether traveling by military transport or walking on the road, it is not as tense and chaotic as in Shanghai. Recently, because Hong Kong Island is humid and tuberculosis is rampant, the Hong Kong government has specifically prohibited residents from spitting anywhere, with fines of twenty-five to one hundred Hong Kong dollars for violators. Now, pedestrians on the road are careful to comply, and it has gradually become a habit. In addition, on issues such as commodity prices, once the government sets a price, it is not allowed to be raised without authorization, otherwise, a penalty will be imposed. When I was in Hong Kong, I saw them buying goods at the government price, and both parties could strictly comply. Unlike merchants in our country hoarding and speculating, commodity prices fluctuate several times a day. As for the Hong Kong dollars issued by the Hong Kong government, everyone trusts them, and there is no inflation. All these things show that the British have the ability to govern, which is worthy of our learning.</p>

<h3>Students Returning from Japan Declare Hearts are Pure</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] Japanese students Yu Zhiqiang, Wang Qingxiang, and others returned to China on the British ship Boktai from Saho last month. The ship arrived here the day before yesterday. Because the students had no place to live in Shanghai, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office provided accommodation and arranged for them to be sent back to their hometowns. Yesterday, student Yu Zhiqiang said that there are currently more than 1,400 students still studying in Japan. They are eager to return to China as soon as possible because life in Japan is extremely difficult, and their families in China cannot remit money to support them. For the sake of their studies, they have to endure hardship. The so-called Imperial Universities in Japan all removed the word "Imperial" in September of this year. Courses related to national defense science, such as "Mechanical Chemistry" and "Atomic Research," have been canceled. The attitude of professors towards Chinese students has also changed. Finally, the student expressed to reporters that although they studied in Japan in the past, their hearts and minds are absolutely pure and holy. He hopes that people in the country will sympathize with and understand them.</p>

<p>Full Round Robin System</p>
<p>Scheduled to Perform at Gymnasium This Weekend The Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, at the suggestion of Chairman Wang Yi, has reformed the competition system. The new proposal is named the "Full Round Robin System." This method uses five-person competitions, in which members of both teams take turns competing against each other. Each game is scored with ten points for a tie, and each person is counted as a win or loss for one game. Regardless of the outcome of the win or loss (according to the original international rules, the first to win thirteen games is the winner), all twenty-five games must be played. This new competition system allows both strong and weak players to have the opportunity to make contact, saves time, is more intense, and is fairer than other systems. According to Chen Lin, general manager of the association, it is hoped that the scoring for each game will be adjusted to 20 points for a tie, which would be even more thorough. It is understood that the association has decided to hold a public demonstration at the gymnasium this weekend to test the system in practice, and all are welcome to visit.</p>

<h3>Qingbai Bai Initially Meets a Strong Opponent; Loses 2-5 to the Jewish Team</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Qingbai Bai, the brother team of the Qingbai Football Team, made their debut yesterday afternoon in the Jia Group League at Yiyuan, facing the Jewish team. Qingbai Bai ultimately lost 2-5 to the dark horse due to insufficient experience and strength, losing after initially leading. Qingbai Bai scored two goals first, but the Jewish team tied the score, making it 2-2 at halftime. In the second half, the Jewish team was extremely aggressive, and the young players were overwhelmed by the strong opponent, losing three consecutive goals, resulting in a final score of 5-2. The audience at Yiyuan yesterday was estimated at 2,000 people, with ticket sales reaching over 16 million yuan.</p>
<p>Referee Ni Xiaoben. In the first half, the young players of Qingbai Bai were quite active and handled the Jewish team with ease. The Jewish team's tactics seemed disjointed, especially goalkeeper Wen Nuogan's carelessness, which allowed Lin Gui to open the scoring, followed by Xue Peiran, making it 2-0. Ultimately, due to the slight inferiority of Qingbai Bai's defense and midfield, the Jewish team, being veterans, managed to equalize with shots from Stan and Liu Han. Carlory further contributed, making it 2-2 at halftime. In the second half, Xu Guofu committed a foul in the penalty area, and Quebisiqi scored a penalty kick. Mai Lvxika and Carlory each scored again, resulting in a 5-2 victory. Jiang Qing of Qingbai Bai's clearance kicks were commendable.</p>

<h3>A Vital Force in Saving the Sugar Famine: Taiwan Sugar Corporation Strives for Production; Expected to Restore 1 Million Tons of Production in Five Years</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Among the enemy properties taken over, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation of the National Resources Commission has been operating quite successfully in the past two years, with ambitious goals. In today's widespread global sugar famine, it is no exaggeration to consider Taiwan Sugar as a national treasure.</p>
<p>In early 1946, there were a total of 42 modern sugar factories in Taiwan. When they were taken over from the Japanese, they had either been damaged by air raids or neglected and left to decay due to human negligence. Rails, spikes, wheels, lubricants – everything was lacking, and the railway system was in a state of extreme dilapidation. The high profits from grain cultivation led farmers to abandon sugarcane and plant grain instead, and there was a shortage of fertilizers. Everything appeared fragmented and broken. It seemed that Taiwan Sugar was destined for total collapse, and the Japanese coldly watched, thinking that it could not be utilized!</p>
<p>US Loan Approval Expected</p>
<p>Today, however, Taiwan Sugar is not heading towards decline. The cadres sent by the motherland to take over and revive Taiwan Sugar have overcome numerous difficulties, worked hard, and, together with American technicians, laid the foundation for a five-year revival plan for Taiwan Sugar. Based on this foundation, Taiwan Sugar will continue to improve, and in five years, it can restore its glorious annual production of one million tons.</p>
<p>This is not just an empty plan on paper, but a culmination of efforts by many Chinese and foreign sugar manufacturing technicians and experts, who conducted numerous on-site investigations and studies and racked their brains to come up with it. The first research result was a five-year plan drafted by American sugar industry engineer Rose E.A. Rose. The total budget for the entire plan was US$30 million. This plan was later shelved for various reasons, and a second five-year plan emerged, requiring US$20 million. It was presented to the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which deemed it quite realistic and believed that Taiwan Sugar was a promising industry. Therefore, there are rumors that consideration for approval is likely to occur within one or two months.</p>
<p>Estimated Sugar Production in Five-Year Budget</p>
<p>According to this plan's budget, the progress of Taiwan Sugar over the five years can be seen in the following statistics: Year - Production Area (hundreds of acres) - Total Sugar Production (thousands of tons) - 1946-47: 78,934, 34 - 1947-48: 210,325, 25 - 1948-49: 281,558, 80 - 1949-50: 395,090, 7 - 1950-51: 432,011, 100. The sugar season is usually calculated from December of the previous year to May of the following year, which is also the sugarcane crushing season of the year. From sugarcane planting to harvest, it takes a full 18 months. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how much effort was spent to achieve the Taiwan Sugar production of 34,000 tons in the past year—which was also the most difficult year for Taiwan!</p>
<p>This year's production, according to the planned target, is 325,000 tons. Judging from all the signs this year, this projected target can be fully realized. Let's look at a few factors that support this: This year's typhoons have been mild, and the production fields have not been affected. The US$5 million loan from the Bank of China has enabled Taiwan Sugar to purchase the necessary machinery, railways, and other equipment from abroad to accelerate the completion of the restoration project. Seven or eight out of ten domestic sugar industry experts have been recruited by the National Resources Commission to participate in Taiwan Sugar. Special loans from the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Bank of Taiwan have solved the problem of Taiwan Sugar's local procurement of equipment. The fertilizer problem has been addressed this year with the procurement of 28,000 tons. These factors have provided a stabilizing anchor for Taiwan Sugar, which has been battered by wind and rain.</p>
<p>Encouraging Sugarcane Farmers to Increase Production</p>
<p>However, the problems are not completely resolved. In an environment where grain cultivation is more profitable, Taiwan Sugar came up with the idea of a sugar exchange method last year to bring back the sugarcane farmers' interest. This idea was to take the sugarcane collected from the sugarcane farmers, crush it into sugar, and give the farmers 48% and Taiwan Sugar 52%. Based on the prevailing sugar price, the sugarcane farmers were paid in cash. At the same time, seedlings, fertilizers, etc., were loaned out during planting. As a result, more than 30,000 tons of Taiwan Sugar were recovered from despair last year. This year, efforts are being redoubled to increase the sugarcane farmers' interest, and the sugar sharing ratio has been decided to be changed to 50% each. Based on a large-scale production of 300,000 tons of sugar, half of which will be paid to the sugarcane farmers in cash, it will require NT$25 billion, or approximately 3 trillion legal tender yuan. These funds need to be raised quickly in preparation for distribution between January and April next year. Currently, the Bank of Taiwan's issuance is already at full capacity, so it is said that Taiwan Sugar is negotiating with the Central Bank to find a solution. For the future of Taiwan Sugar, the Central Bank will certainly come up with a clever plan.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Taiwan Sugar's Export Performance</p>
<p>In today's widespread global sugar famine, Taiwan Sugar's exports will undoubtedly be sought after everywhere. The question is whether we are willing to supply and how much we are willing to supply. From 1946 to 1947, Taiwan Sugar made its maiden export venture, totaling less than 3,000 tons. The largest exports were to Singapore and Hong Kong, and even Java, a sugar production region, imported Taiwan Sugar, with prices as high as £125 per ton, which is nothing short of a miracle. The export plan for 1947 to 1948 is to export 100,000 tons, of which Japan and India account for about 50%, and the rest will be distributed to the Near East, Malaya, Bangkok, and other regions. The current world price of sugar is approximately US$250. Taiwan Sugar is earning considerable foreign exchange for us. Let us pray that the US loan to revive Taiwan Sugar will be approved soon. Sweet Taiwan Sugar, the motherland needs you, and the world needs you!</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Invites Relevant Parties to Discuss Next Year's Sericulture Industry; Initial Decisions Reached for Seed Production and Mulberry Seedling Groups</h3>
<p>The China Silk Corporation has been sparing no effort in guiding the improvement of the sericulture industry in recent years. It has achieved considerable success in increasing the production of mulberry seedlings, silkworm seeds, and silk cocoons. In order to plan for the national sericulture industry for the coming year, the company invited the heads of construction departments from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as relevant personnel, to hold group meetings starting on the 24th of last month. They discussed together in order to gather ideas, broaden their horizons, and exchange opinions. As of the end of last week, initial decisions had been reached regarding the seed production and mulberry seedling groups. The remaining groups, such as silk weaving finance, guidance, and production and sales, are still under discussion. The results of the discussions of the first and second groups are recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Amount of improved seeds for the coming spring in China: Net aseptic seed production in spring and autumn - Jiangsu: 836,158 sheets, Zhejiang: 237,900 sheets, Yunnan: 140,000 sheets, Other: 20,000 sheets, Total: 1,334,058 sheets.</p>
<p>B. Estimated demand for silkworm seeds in various provinces in China next spring: Jiangsu: 600,000 sheets, Zhejiang: 650,000 sheets, Guangdong: 50,000 sheets, Sichuan: 30,000 sheets (excluding the number imported from other provinces in addition to self-production), Other: 20,000 sheets, Total: 1,350,000 sheets. Compared with the supply, there is still a shortage of 120,000 sheets, and research is currently underway to manufacture in Guangdong and Taiwan, or purchase from Japan to supplement the shortfall. For the mulberry seedling portion, it is planned to purchase and promote 5.2 million seedling plants, with 5 million plants allocated to Guangdong and about 200,000 plants to other regions, all free of charge. In addition, 6 million grafted seedlings will be promoted to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces at low prices, with 2.5 million plants to each province. Approximately 1 million plants will be allocated to other regions.</p>

<h3>Felt Shoes and Felt Socks Exempted from Commodity Tax</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of Finance believes that the production volume of felt shoes and felt socks is very small, and they are mostly produced by family handicraft industries. Management is difficult. In consideration of the handicraft industry, felt shoes and felt socks are temporarily exempted from commodity tax. Subsequently, wool yarn, wool money, and woolen products such as felt hat blanks and felt are the target of commodity tax collection. Other woolen products will be exempt from tax unless there is a considerable output.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Import Merchant Registration with the Transportation and Management Committee of South China is the 10th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] The deadline for import merchant registration with the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee is set for the 10th. As of the 6th, 632 import merchants and 358 factories in Guangzhou City have applied for registration. The committee is scheduled to hold an import merchant registration review meeting on the 8th and discuss related matters. The Import Merchants Trade Association of Guangzhou is currently requesting improvements to the import settlement method and asking the Transportation and Management Committee branch to issue import permits promptly. The South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee has also responded to the requests of merchants in Guangzhou to relax export and import quotas on an item-by-item basis. The important points include: Import merchant registration should be certified by government agencies. Registration certificates issued by tax authorities should be submitted at the time of registration. Agency for foreign manufacturers is limited to one agent. Indirect foreign factory agencies contracted by Guangzhou merchants with Hong Kong and Macau are also valid. The import ban on woolen fabrics cannot be lifted. Shipping companies are not allowed to register.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Commodity Prices Temporarily Stabilized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Commodity prices in Tianjin have temporarily stabilized since the National, Provincial, and Municipal Banks stopped lending. Mayor Du Jianshi, in order to completely stabilize prices while considering the operations of legitimate businesses, telegraphed President Zhang Qun and Governor Zhang Jia'ao on the 6th. The telegram stated that in order to curb speculation, the Municipal Bank had been ordered to stop lending, and the Hebei Provincial Bank was also instructed to do the same. Subsequently, the National Bank also stopped lending, which was beneficial to stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, this is not a fundamental solution to stabilizing prices, and if no other remedies are sought, it is feared that legitimate businesses will become increasingly depressed due to difficulties in revolving funds. Please instruct the authorities to promptly review and implement measures to curb manipulation while maintaining legitimate business operations.</p>
<h3>Exports Increase</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] According to statistics from the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the total value of inspected and qualified export goods in November was 69.190,163,585 yuan, an increase of one-eighth compared to October. Pork bristles accounted for 45.308,310,385 yuan.</p>
<h3>Calcium Carbonate Production Does Not Meet the Needs of the Rubber Industry</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The price of calcium carbonate is rising, at around 9,500 to 600 yuan per pound. According to rubber industry sources, calcium carbonate is an essential raw material for manufacturing rubber, and various factories have a strong demand for it. Currently, only Da Zhonghua among the rubber factories in Shanghai can produce it themselves. Currently, the factories supplying calcium carbonate in Shanghai, such as Linghu, Meitai, Zhao Xin, and China, have increased their output, but it is still hoped that they will be encouraged to continue increasing production. It is reported that Linghu Chemical Plant, the largest in scale, can already produce more than 250 tons per month and will actively continue to increase production.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market opened lower in the morning. Subsequently, it was heard that Yizhong Company had raised the price of ten large British cigarettes per carton (50,000 cigarettes) to 22.5 million yuan, Old Knife to 19 million yuan, and Hardman to 17 million yuan. However, due to tight credit, the industry was inactive. Around 9:00 AM, purchasing agents arrived, but prices remained high, and there was still a large supply. As a result, the prices of both British and Old Knife cigarettes fell by 700,000 to 500,000 yuan, Hardman dropped by 200,000 yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also saw declines.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Firm</h3>
<p>Domestic woolen fabrics from local factories, such as wide and narrow camel wool, are more abundant this year than in previous years. The wholesale price of first-grade is 400,000 yuan per yard, second-grade 330,000-350,000 yuan, and third-grade 250,000-260,000 yuan. Sales are mostly to silk, satin, and foreign goods merchants, while formal woolen fabric stores on Qipan Street are less active. American camel wool, because it can be made into coats, is sold by many woolen fabric stores. Currently, the asking price for first-grade is 1.45 million yuan per yard, and second-grade is 1 million yuan. Formally imported sea otter hair, mohair, and sea tiger hair are very low. Long-haired wool from local factories is most popular among women, and nine out of ten women's winter coats are made from this material. Supply cannot meet demand, and market prices continue to rise. The wholesale price of Hailong brand is 1.25 million yuan per yard, and Yonghe brand is 1.15 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Qihong Tea Transactions Stable</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea, under the constant attention of British merchants, continued to be traded over the weekend. However, the situation remains that sellers are numerous, and it is difficult to distinguish between them. As for various types of domestic sales, shops and stores in the street continue to stock up, and people generally express stability, so the market remains stable.</p>
<h3>Lumber Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, the lumber market has seen soft prices for fir and foreign pine due to sluggish sales and weak demand.</p>

<h3>A Ten-Year Scientific Research Plan for the United States</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>——Look at others, think of ourselves——</p>
<p>In the past, the United States absorbed scientific theories passed down from Europe. Today, it must make its own contributions to theoretical science. It must engage in large-scale scientific research to satisfy eager engineers. Airplanes are flying faster than sound, but there is still no complete theory to explain and prevent dangers. At the same time, the application of atomic energy requires new theoretical discoveries. In the past, the United States mostly used others' theories to invent many groundbreaking things. Previously, two German scientists relied on Italian research to discover the theory of nuclear fission, which inspired Americans to invent the atomic bomb. But today, it is no longer time for the United States to rely on others. Faced with this reality, a group of American scientific researchers, including military and non-military personnel, under the guidance of a presidential science advisor, conducted detailed and extensive discussions and submitted a report on a ten-year scientific research plan to the White House. They unanimously agreed that unless the United States delves into hard work for ten years, it will not have achievements comparable to others. The ten-year plan provides detailed guidance on the content and direction of research.</p>
<p>Exploring the Unknown</p>
<p>This is the first goal in future research. Whether from government or private funding, 90% will be used for new theoretical research, and the remaining 10% will be used for research on existing theories. Moreover, funding for basic scientific research should be four times the current amount. In the future, the amount spent on military weapons research needs to be reduced to be used for other urgently needed departments. It is projected that by 1957, basic scientific research will account for 20% of the total funding, while military research will only account for 40%. The rest will be provided by the Federal Treasury to engage in research. Research funding from the industrial sector is mostly focused on practical applications. In addition to doubling the efforts of government agencies, colleges also engage in this exploration of pure theory.</p>
<p>Medical Research</p>
<p>Currently, the United States spends only $28 million annually on medical and public health research. By 1957, it will have to spend $300 million to engage in medical and health research.</p>
<p>In 1947, the United States spent an unprecedented amount on scientific research. Excluding the confidential atomic energy research funding, there was as much as $1.16 billion, which is exactly ten times that of 1930 and twice the annual average during the war. But according to this plan, by 1957, it will have to be $2.2 billion. At first glance, it is daunting, but it only accounts for 1% of the country's total revenue. Many private companies have spent up to 2% of their annual revenue on new product research, and some have even spent 5% or 6%.</p>
<p>Training Talent</p>
<p>The first step is to train a large number of scientific workers. The current shortage of scientists is quite severe. Many government positions in the scientific field are vacant. The military still needs a quarter of the current number of personnel researching ballistics and radiation; and the Atomic Energy Commission cannot find many suitable scientists. Many urgent research projects in the Navy and public health sectors cannot be started due to a lack of personnel.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: from 1940 to 1947, scientific research funding increased by 335% of the original amount, while scientific workers increased by only 35%. In fact, if the United States had not had the war, it could have cultivated more than 90,000 scientific bachelors and 5,000 scientific doctorates. More serious in this talent shortage is the insufficient scientific guidance in universities. The number of students has more than doubled compared to wartime, while the number of teachers has only increased by 30%. According to the current trend, at least 15,000 more lecturers are needed. Therefore, this talent shortage will not be eliminated until 1952. It is projected that today's freshman students can directly participate in work at that time.</p>
<p>Overall Plan</p>
<p>Direct overall planning of scientific research work by the government is a first for the United States. Forty-one federal research bureaus will be ordered to engage in different work at the same time, so there will be no duplication or omissions. In the past, the US Navy and Army made mistakes due to a lack of communication planning and unified guidance. Now they can be centralized for division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Another important facility is to expand and enrich these decent laboratories. The plan requires $150 million to equip university laboratories.</p>
<p>Transmitting foreign scientific knowledge to the United States is also an important task. Scientific intelligence stations are set up in embassies stationed in various countries. They must regularly report on all scientific activities in that country, just like reporting on commercial news. Currently, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have such agencies in the United States; and it is particularly important to translate all important scientific papers from the Soviet Union into the United States in a timely manner to exchange new knowledge.</p>
<p>This plan should be the minimum effort for the United States in the next ten years. Other countries have already secretly planned scientific research. The Soviet Union spent as much as $120 million on research in 1947, and they will have 700,000 engineers and scientists working when the five-year plan is completed. At that time, the United States may only have 600,000 students in college. Many countries are moving in this direction. The United Kingdom plans to produce twice as many scientists each year as the previous year; Belgium has increased its research funding by two times; India is focusing on building new laboratories and cultivating scientists to engage in the study of its most appropriate product—atomic bomb raw materials. Based on these facts and reasons, the US government must immediately lead all US scientists to explore greater and more extensive new knowledge.</p>
<h3>Bat Radar</h3>
<p>— You Ding</p>
<p>That bats can fly at night, swiftly moving without colliding with obstacles in their path, has long puzzled biologists and even physicists. To understand this mystery, many scientists have captured bats for experiments. They discovered that bats flying indoors could not only avoid walls and furniture, but also spiderwebs. Initially, this was perplexing. Later, they discovered that certain disturbances to their hearing might disrupt their flight, making it difficult for them to clearly avoid obstacles as before.</p>
<p>In 1920, Professor Hartridge suggested that when bats fly in the dark night, it might be because they emit a type of ultra-high-speed sound wave (Super-sonic Sounds) that reflects back to their ears, allowing them to determine the location of obstacles. Twenty years later, the invention of radar and sonar made this clearer, as these two devices are theoretically and practically the same as the aforementioned action of bats, except that bats emit neither electromagnetic waves nor ordinary sound waves. The frequency range of the ultra-high-speed sound waves they emit is 25,000 to 70,000 vibrations per second, while the sound waves that humans can hear have a frequency of only 16 to 3,000 vibrations per second. Therefore, the sound waves emitted by bats actually exceed the limits of human perception.</p>
<p>This theory has experimental basis. Two scholars captured bats and tested them one by one, covering their mouths and noses, leaving only their ears. Removing ____, they could still fly as before. Then, they further used an electronic machine, a high-frequency analyzer, to assist in the experiment. The important part of this analyzer is a ____ receiver, which is extremely sensitive to ultra-high-speed sound waves, and an amplifier that can change the frequency of the sound waves from high to low. Therefore, the analyzer can ____ measure any high-speed sound waves it receives. Using this machine, they found that bats are almost constantly emitting ultra-high-speed sound waves. The frequency varies, of course, but mostly around 50,000 vibrations per second. Under this adjustment, each squeak lasts only one two-hundredth of a second. It has been proven that bats squeak about ten times per second when resting, but this increases to thirty times per second when flapping their wings and flying. When approaching an obstacle, their squeaks suddenly increase to fifty or even sixty times per second, but when the obstacle has passed, the frequency immediately decreases to normal. The "rate" of squeaking naturally changes with the distance to the object because they need to calculate the time of the sound returning from the object.</p>
<p>In addition to the ultra-high-speed sounds that humans cannot hear, bats also emit three other types of sounds, including: a normal sound they make while flying, which Hartridge called a signal tone; a ____ sound that humans can hear when ____ it approaches; and a ____ reply, which can often be heard within a few feet. This "signal tone" varies with the species of bat, while the buzzing sound and the reply are ____ byproducts of ultra-high-speed sound waves. However, the "signal tone" may also be accompanied by ultra-high-speed sound waves. Although it is not known exactly how these four types of sounds are produced, observations and studies of their throats have shown that they are very different from those of ordinary animals. The throats of most animals are made of cartilage, but the throats of bats are made of hard bone, with a huge and strong muscle. The rigidity and small shape of the bat's throat suggest that it is extremely suitable for generating ultra-high-speed sound waves.</p>
<p>Although it is not known how ultra-high-speed sound waves are produced, it is known how bats avoid hearing their own squeaks and only receive the echoes from objects. There is usually a muscle in the bat's ear. As soon as a squeak is emitted, the muscle contracts, trying to prevent the squeak from being heard and only allowing the echo to enter.</p>
<p>Bats are not the only animals that can hear ultra-high-speed sound waves, but bats are currently the only ones discovered that can emit ultra-high-speed sound waves and use their echoes to guide themselves. This is also a miracle of nature.</p>

<p>Scientific Common Sense</p>
<h3>Crabs and Persimmons</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>"Crabs and persimmons are incompatible; they should not be eaten together." This is a very common saying, and many people firmly believe it. This saying has been around for a long time. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said, "They should not be eaten with persimmons; eating them together will cause ____ and wind."</p>
<p>Mr. ____ Ji once experimented using scientific methods. He removed the intestines and stomach of crabs, washed them clean, added salt, and cooked them. Then, he mixed them with an equal amount of persimmons (peeled) and fed them to white mice and dogs for two days. There were no signs of poisoning. Body temperature, stool color, and frequency were observed in detail, and the results were normal, with no signs of illness. (The original experiment can be found in "Science" Volume 24, Issue 7)</p>
<p>The saying about incompatibility probably arose because someone who happened to have eaten crabs and persimmons became ill or died; or they ate too much, exceeding their appetite, and became ill from overeating. They immediately blamed the "incompatibility" of these two foods. In fact, eating too much of any single food can cause illness or even death. Why blame only crabs and persimmons?</p>
<h3>Gospel for the Disabled</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>We are about to see ____ using "optical canes." These are used to help blind people ____ sense. A beam of light can accurately detect obstacles within twenty feet.</p>
<p>This device is similar to radar, but uses visible light instead of ____ waves. A nine-pound box, about the size of a loaf of bread, is held in one hand with an earphone.</p>
<p>Trees, people, stairs, and other objects can be heard by the blind. After getting used to the various sounds of different lengths emitted by the instrument, the user can skillfully distinguish the distance of objects.</p>
<p>A new, improved electric arm is powered by batteries and a motor, weighs three pounds, is supported on a crutch, and is rotated by a belt attached to the waist. Within a year, disabled American veterans may have this equipment.</p>
<p>Blind people can use a new aid to help them read. This device can convert the letters printed on paper into clear sounds, allowing the blind to hear them. The blind person points a device resembling a large fountain pen at a word. At the "head" of this pen is a beam of light that is connected to an amplifier tube.</p>
<p>Each letter emits five different sounds, and the reader can hear the sounds through a hearing aid. The total weight of this electronic tube device is only five and a quarter pounds, and it can read all printed letters.</p>
<p>Germans have invented an artificial leg that is controlled by an electric mechanism connected to the damaged nerve endings of the amputated leg. German inventors believe that the small currents flowing in the nerves can provide power and can be controlled by the brain, allowing it to act according to the user's will. This "electric leg" was still in the experimental stage when the war ended. American scientists are somewhat skeptical of the performance of this device but are conducting further research.</p>
<p>Science Ramblings</p>
<h3>Talking About Wood Structure</h3>
<p>— Tang Yao</p>
<p>People often ask me, "Which wood is the best in China?" My answer is, "It depends on what you want to use it for." Generally speaking, solid wood is good, but it is not necessarily suitable for all purposes. For example, wood for papermaking should be light in color, light in weight, straight in grain, and light in weight. Commercial wood such as Balsa also has its special uses, such as being used as a float for survival. The lightest paulownia wood produced in our country is used by the Japanese to make clogs. It is planed into thin wood and pasted on paper, called paulownia paper, and used for Christmas greeting cards, which were sold well in the United States before the war. From these examples, we can see that the quality of wood is relative, not absolute. Just like judging a person, we can say that A has these good points and B has these bad points. The nature of a person is the same as that of wood.</p>
<p>Each type of wood has its advantages and disadvantages. Compared with metal materials, wood has the following advantages: (1) lighter in weight; (2) easier to saw and plane; (3) easier to bond or fix with mechanical methods; (4) easier to paint; (5) easier to ____ bond; (6) can absorb ____ east, can withstand considerable pressure and bending; (7) does not easily conduct heat and transmit sound; (8) has beautiful color; (9) easy to float; (10) easy to separate for ____ dimensional raw materials; (11) can be injected with preservatives or other chemicals; (12) expands and contracts less due to temperature differences. Conversely, wood also has its disadvantages, the most ____ obvious of which are: (1) easily affected by external humidity, causing wood to constantly expand and contract, warp, and even crack; (2) extremely variable mechanical strength; (3) has knots and other defects, making it difficult to select materials with the same standards; (4) easily catches fire; (5) easily eroded by fungal and insect pests, leading to decay. Therefore, we must understand its structure and composition in order to use its strengths, avoid its weaknesses, and further improve its weaknesses.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that wood is a complex compound produced by plants. In the plant body, it is used to conduct water, support the whole body, or store food. Different plants have different structures. For example, the wood of pine trees is different from that of nanmu. But in itself, they are all well-matched and best suited for their lives.</p>
<p>But when we cut down trees and supply them for our use, for various purposes, it depends on whether we can fully "use materials according to their properties."</p>
<p>Wood is produced by plants; plants are living things, so wood, unlike copper and iron, is affected by the external environment throughout its growth process: for example, the soil, rainfall, temperature, and other climate change factors, the erosion of insect pests and diseases, the density of growth, and even the scientific management of forests, can all affect the final product of the wood. These environmental changes are recorded on the wood, and we can indirectly infer them from the density of the growth rings on the cross-section of the wood or the growth bands on the longitudinal section, the amount of ____ wood (Late Wood Band) in each growth ring, and the thickness of the cell wall (Cell Wall) of the wood cells, and even the number of various cells that make up the wood.</p>
<p>The structure of various woods is quite different; even the same tree species can vary greatly due to different growing locations. Even the same tree species growing in the same place, the roots or base, branches, and the trunk, as well as wood at different heights and different radial distances, are different. Moreover, the degree of these differences may be greater in the same tree species than in different species. Therefore, all these things make this organic wood extremely variable (Variability), causing great difficulties in its use and material property research.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows a little about botany knows that wood is not a solid thing like copper, iron, or cement, but is made up of specialized "tracheary elements or tubular fiber-units or cells" glued together. ____ This specialized cell is mainly used to conduct water in the plant body: it transports the water and inorganic salts absorbed by the roots to the ____ for food production.</p>
<p>If you look at the cross-section of wood under a microscope, it is like a honeycomb. Each tube is empty; in professional terms, the former is called the "cell wall" and the latter is called the "cell cavity" (Cell Cavity). On the adjacent cell walls, there are many small holes or pits, allowing the trees to be well connected during growth; these unthickened cell walls are called "pits" (Pit). The tubular cells in wood can be roughly divided into two categories: one is a non-open tube, connected up and down, like bamboo stalks are composed of sections; but wood is not as neat as that. This type of cell is called "tracheid" (Tracheid), which constitutes the main body of coniferous (Conifers or Coniferae) wood (only three genera of gymnosperms in the world do not have tracheids). Its length averages about 2-4 hao m.m. Its adjacent wall (referring to the cell walls adjacent to the left and right) has bordered pits (Bordered pit). There is also a type of "tubular cell" whose bottom wall is partially or completely missing, forming a vertically connected series of cells, fused to form a tubular structure of indefinite length; their adjacent walls also have bordered pits. The average length of this type of cell is less than one hao, and it is called "vessel," which is unique to various ____ materials (Broaded Leafep Tress) such as poplar and ____ wood (only four genera of ____ materials in the world do not have vessels). Therefore, these two types of cells are very important to the properties of wood.</p>
<p>Speaking of coniferous and ____ materials, there are two fairly common commercial terms that can be introduced. Generally, "softwoods" (Softwoods) are pine, cypress, and cedar. ____ The wood of trees is usually called "hardwoods" (Hardwoods), such as poplar, cypress, and ____ wood. These two terms are commonly used in various countries and are completely equivalent to coniferous or ____ materials in botany. Their meaning only represents two major categories of wood and has nothing to do with the weight of the wood. For example, hemlock, this kind of ____ material, is much heavier and harder than poplar.

<h3>Looking From the Side</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>People with eyes must use their eyes more. What comes in through the ears can only be used as a reference for the eyes, unless they are blind, relying solely on unreliable ears.</p>
<p>Those who can use their eyes not only doubt their own ears but also do not overly trust their own "naked eyes." They are never satisfied with recognizing the shapes and colors before them. They put on telescopes to see the distant future from the present, and use microscopes to uncover invisible secrets. When a person can stand at the correct angle and see the causes and consequences of things clearly, no matter how bizarre the changes before them, they will not panic and lose their composure. However, those who are innately nearsighted and groping in the dark, even if what lies before them is not a trap, without any obstacles, but a wide open road, dare not take bold steps. Such a life is indeed painful.</p>
<p>Living in this world, one must never stare directly at reality. Staring directly at reality often results from overusing one's eyes, seeing more and more vaguely, and even being enveloped by reality, becoming a part of reality. How about resolutely extracting oneself from the shroud of reality, waving one's sleeves, brushing off the red dust from one's body, and quietly hiding on the side of super interest, looking at reality from the side. Perhaps one can recognize reality and find many undiscovered secrets.</p>
<p>Today, people deeply hate corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, and have no good feelings for them! Not only that, even those who eat ____ country accumulation, when their conscience is awakened in the morning, must deeply feel guilty, admitting that their sins are heavy and will not disappear on their own, but will bring disaster to the people. However, this extreme argument sometimes lacks moderation and cannot forcibly find useful qualities in useless waste to comfort oneself. Looking at it from the front, the means of corruption and hoarding can certainly harm the country and endanger the people, leading everyone to live a life like years, unsure of the next day; but looking at it from the side, the means of corruption and hoarding are originally a shortcut for Chinese people to get rich. Those who have become rich because of it certainly have self-awareness. All who eat the produce of the land want to get rich, and if they have actually pioneered such a shortcut, then the means of eating ____ and hoarding, although opposed by the majority of suffering people, will undoubtedly be supported by the minority who benefit endlessly.</p>
<p>The US Congress calls clearing up official corruption cases "muckraking." This means that without corrupt officials who create ____, there is no need to rely on muckraking scavengers. Since corrupt hoarders are everywhere, and the muckraking scavengers, for the sake of factual needs, cannot but increase. In addition to extra, various extra titles are added to engage in the work of clearing up corruption and hoarding. Looking at it from the front, the means of corrupting the country are ____; but looking at it from the side, because of the efforts of some people to create ____, achieving brilliant achievements, it also undoubtedly allows some other people to obtain job security. Precisely because more and more ____ is being raked up, the task of muckraking is even more given the meaning of the times. If there were a day when corruption was completely eliminated, those scavengers who specialize in raking ____ for a living would only have to announce their retirement. I think this unemployment problem is also quite serious. Therefore, in all things, one must never stare directly at reality, but should look at it from all sides. If you cannot see it from the front, look at it from the opposite side, from the side. You will know that darkness is the foil of light, that ____ is the emphasis of fragrance. The Creator creates all things, each with its own mystery, and we ordinary people really have no need to waste our brains, sighing and lamenting!</p>
<h3>Research on "Miss"</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Today, people respectfully address young women as "Miss." According to Qian Weiyan's "Jade Hall Fengchenlu," "Miss Han, a palace maid in charge of tea and wine," the word "Miss" first appeared here. However, it is still a person's name, not a title, so it is not seen in poetry. Since the Ming Dynasty, there has been a line "Three inches of arched shoes are revealed in front of the curtain, knowing that a graceful Miss is coming." The word "Miss" first appeared in poetry.</p>
<h3>Crisis</h3>
<p>— Zeng Shen</p>
<p>A French painter, while drinking in a hotel, accidentally saw a newspaper left by someone on the floor. The headline on the newspaper was: "Economic crisis is coming."</p>
<p>When he finished drinking one glass of wine and the waiter asked him if he wanted another, he refused because "the economic crisis is coming."</p>
<p>The hotel owner called out: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then my wife's new coat should not be made." So he went to tell the owner of the fashion company.</p>
<p>The owner of the fashion company said: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then our company should not renovate the facade." So he went to tell the owner of the construction company.</p>
<p>The owner of the construction company ____ed a sigh: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then my wife should not pay a high price to have a painter make a portrait."</p>
<p>The painter received a letter from the owner of the construction company canceling the portrait appointment. Naturally unhappy, he went to the hotel to drink again. The hotel owner was lethargic these days and even too lazy to have the waiters clean up the hall. The newspaper that the painter had seen a few days ago was still on the floor. He read the headline news again. But when he looked at the date of the newspaper again, he couldn't help but call out—it turned out to be a ____ newspaper from two years ago!</p>
<h3>Remembering the New Yorker</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>During the war, we generally felt a magazine shortage. Both Chinese and Western magazines were declining, especially Western magazines. Apart from the machine Bank Copy, there were simply no new ones.</p>
<p>Since last year, Western magazines ____ have poured into Shanghai, allowing us to broaden our horizons again. Among them, several magazines are expired overseas military editions, which are still fresh to those who have not been to the mainland, so overseas editions of magazines sell very well in Shanghai. For example, "The New Yorker" is one of the overseas editions. The format is half the size of the normal one, the text content is exactly the same, only the advertisements are missing, and the font size is halved.</p>
<p>After the overseas edition was cut off, ordinary magazines were imported, but only "The New Yorker" has not been seen with new arrivals until now. Why is it that in today's situation where all kinds of magazines ____ are coming, only this "New Yorker" magazine, which sells very widely and has very popular text content, does not descend on Shanghai. It is really a mystery.</p>
<p>"The New Yorker" is a humorous and serious general reading material. The opening "comments" are humorous and scolding, bizarre and grotesque. Although they reflect a society in New York, they are something that people all over the world like to know a little secret about. Later novels, features, book reviews, movie introductions, and character descriptions all maintain the unique style of "The New Yorker." Even the comics and black and white illustrations at the beginning of the book represent the personality of "The New Yorker." Not only are they their characteristics, but they have also influenced other publications to adopt the same style of comics.</p>
<p>The English Da Mei Evening News sometimes reprints articles from "The New Yorker," allowing us to get a glimpse of them, which makes us even more miss this magazine, which is so good and full of intimate words.</p>
<h3>The "Uselessness" of "Pen Tips"</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Han Shi Wai Zhuan says: "A gentleman avoids three ends: the sharp end of a warrior, the ancient end of a debater, and the pen tip of a literati." Among these three, the "pen tip" was considered the most powerful by the ancients. The so-called "Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and rebellious ministers and traitors feared." Why? Because "the punishment of a word is more severe than an axe" is also true.</p>
<p>However, even so, the rebellious ministers and traitors of each dynasty still followed one after another, rising up in every generation. It can also be seen that the "pen tip" is not necessarily really that scary. What is the reason for this? I think it is because many literati who have written books and said things since Confucius have devolved into "being used" or "having literature without action."</p>
<p>Confucius' attitude towards learning and being a person was very serious. If "the way is not practiced," he would rather "ride a raft and float on the sea," and would never be careless. Therefore, the Spring and Autumn Annals he wrote became a great cause of "ice and frost in one sentence, axes for thousands of years." This is something that ordinary literati who are "used" or "have literature without action" cannot even hope to achieve. Therefore, the power of the "pen tip" has become more and more useless.</p>
<p>For example, ____ Wang Yanzhang, although listed in the famous literary circle, was a Tingnan lyricist ____, but judging from his flattery and slander of Li Gang, he was contradictory before and after, and fickle, which will also prove that he is just a small person who "plays with words" and has no backbone. In his article congratulating Li Gang on becoming Right Chancellor, he wrote: "Utmost loyalty penetrates the sun, in the midst of overturning the two ____; heroic spirit traverses autumn, laughing at ten thousand ____. Having a high reputation and charming the crowd, yet ____ and personally endangered. Scholars complained of public injustices, quickly raising banners and gathering under the palace gate; the emperor followed the people's wishes, ordering him to be spared from the stomach to see the people of the country." His praise for Li can be said to be exhaustive. Later, Li was falsely accused by Zhang Jun and dismissed. Yanjun then drafted an edict saying: "Associates with evil to deceive the emperor, those with ____ must be removed from Huan Dou; deceiving the world and stealing fame, Confucius first beheaded Zheng Mao. Special killing still threatens, harming the virtuous of the holy emperors; valuing slander and liking flattery, being the clan of a group of small people for a time." They belonged to the same person before and after, and their fickleness was so great. Of course, such a "pen tip" could not play a big role. If he falsely accused good people in this way, and then turned to "rebellious ministers and traitors," then "rebellious ministers and traitors" would not only laugh secretly to themselves, but would also "use the shield of the son to attack the spear of the son," exposing their faces to the other party!</p>
<p>Naturally, there are as many people like Wang Yanzhang in every dynasty as there are "grains of sand in the Ganges." After the early years of the Republic of China, the warlords stole the country, and the "gun tip" raised its head greatly. With this trend, the "pen tip" naturally went down like the sun setting in the river. The "pen tip," one of the three ends that the ancients said should be avoided, has now become a useless waste. Is it not appropriate!</p>
<h3>Balushu's Humor</h3>
<p>— Italian Meaning</p>
<p>Former Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Balushu, once invited a friend to his country villa for a hunt. That friend was determined to shoot a few ducks, but he used up a lot of bullets without success. Balushu saw that his skills were not very good, but naturally it was not appropriate to criticize him.</p>
<p>The friend was leaving the day before his departure. His hunting enthusiasm was still undiminished. He walked into the woods and saw a large wild duck perched on a branch. He quickly and quietly approached, aimed carefully, and with a "bang," the duck fell to the ground!</p>
<p>He was overjoyed and quickly bent down to pick it up, but upon closer inspection, he saw a note on the duck's neck, which read, "Respectfully presented by Balushu."</p>
<h3>Watching "British Landscape"</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>With the rise of the petty bourgeoisie, landscape painting in Europe flourished from the Netherlands around the seventeenth century. However, it was in the work of British painters that one saw the most unusual and beautiful things in this area.</p>
<p>Of course, the development of landscape painting is undoubtedly related to the aversion to scientific life and the longing for pastoral life. Therefore, the industrial revolution was first completed in Britain, and landscape painting flourished in Britain, there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Recently, the British Council held a "British Landscape Exhibition" at the Da Xin Art Gallery, displaying fifty reproductions of colored landscape paintings and photographs for the Shanghai public to view. We can certainly feast our eyes on the beautiful scenery of the island, but from the perspective of art appreciation, these twenty-nine colored reproductions of landscape paintings are worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The world-renowned British painters, Turner and Constable, are the two masters of naturalism. Their landscape paintings had a huge impact on the color and light of Impressionist painting at the end of the nineteenth century. Turner's colors are bright and beautiful; Constable's sunlight is brilliant and pleasing to the eye. In this exhibition, the former has a total of four works, and No. 14 "Crossing the Creek" can be regarded as representative of his style. The others are just watercolor studies. The latter has only one work, No. 13 "Landscape." The arrangement of light and shadow is appropriate, worthy of a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The earlier masters, Gainsborough, Sandby, and Calmen, also have many works included. Although it is impossible to see the entire history of British landscape painting, one can get a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>British landscape painting, especially watercolor painting, seems to have a traditional form. In this exhibition, the works of Pliot and Hunt can be said to be completely conservative in this tradition. However, the style of Cezanne at the end of the nineteenth century, as well as the so-called emerging schools such as New Objectivity, have also entered the conservative British art scene. The expression of the blocks in the painting No. 17 Dukes Dairy (by E. White) undoubtedly inherited Cezanne's technique. However, the emerging schools have after all developed on the European continent. Across the sea, the works of British artists such as Nash and Nevioson have been baptized by the Parisian style, but upon closer examination, their expressive power is still not full and strong enough.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I have been exposed to the taste of European art. Watching British landscape paintings is indeed of endless interest.</p>
<h3>Method of Washing Away a Bad Name</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>The Ga-Fei tribe of South Africa has a way to wash away the bad name of a criminal. They take a teapot full of boiling water, shout the name of the criminal loudly at the spout, and quickly cover it with a lid. After letting the bad name "soak" in the teapot for many days, the criminal's reputation is considered clean again.</p>
<h3>Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling No. 2: The Painters of Liangshan Marsh</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Gao Longsheng</p>
<p>A college student in Shanghai found 15,000 yuan on a rickshaw. A professor in Xi'an became a thief, and when it was published in the newspaper, it was mostly labeled with the title "The Intellectuals' Decorum has Fallen to the Ground." In fact, the intellectuals who have fallen to the ground have long become "dog bites man" news (in a fine arts school in Chongqing, there was a dean of studies who stole a colleague's old overcoat to get a full meal).</p>
<p>In Yunnan, a middle school art teacher made a mistake in a painting of a bulletin board heading for students. This is not surprising, but what is strange is that he said: I don't have to worry about rice and firewood every day, and the students don't have to be shocked for me. I am getting benevolence without seeking it.</p>
<p>During the war, the largest market for painters was Zigong in Sichuan, which produced salt, and Neijiang, which produced sugar. Generally, holding exhibitions there would allow them to eat for half a year or three months, because there were plenty of rich people there, and the rich people were willing to sell face and make friends with some elegant friends to dilute the smell of money.</p>
<p>But now, when a painter's paintings are sent, they only get rejection slips.</p>
<p>Some time ago, a fine arts professor in Chongqing took his proud work to the door of a wealthy friend to sell it. The doorman went in to show it. The painting was returned, but the painter was given 10,000 yuan. It was simply not only treating him as a beggar who begged for food, but also a beggar who spent his travel expenses. The professor didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>In Water Margin, the great thieves, the sacred-handed scholar Xiao Rang and the jade-armed ape Jin Dajian, one was a calligrapher and the other was a epigraphist. Unexpectedly, today they were discovered in "Liangshan" not far from Chongqing. Among a group of bandits, a deputy leader was Chen, who studied painting in France.</p>
<p>The desire for survival is compressed to a limited extent. Once this limit is exceeded, one hand holding a painting and the other holding a gun may happen one day. "The tip of the pen sweeps across thousands of people" is Wang Shifu's boasting, but the tip of the gun sweeping across one person is not a ridiculous dream.</p>
<h3>Unfettered Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 2: A Gentle Conversation (8)</p>
<p>Qi Wan paused and then said: "I cried when I heard this, but the two teachers were determined to resign and could not be persuaded to stay. This was entirely because my brother offended them with a few words. If they don't teach me opera, what hope do I have for the future! I just cry every day, blaming my brother for being wrong. My father advocated that I no longer need to learn opera. As a scholarly family, a girl should go to school and study. I said that I have already learned opera. If I hold books and study again, I won't be able to study. I cried every day. My father scolded me whenever he saw me. The father and daughter often quarreled over disagreements. When my brother saw that my father was angry with me every day, he let me move out and live at No. 12."</p>
<p>When Qi Wan said this, she was very touched and paused again. After listening, Zhu Zhai felt that a weak woman struggled so hard for art and suffered all kinds of obstacles, and expressed great sympathy in his heart, and said: "So that's how it is. Boss Gu, you are also considered unfortunate to have suffered so much for learning opera." Qi Wan said sadly: "I can only blame my bad luck. "As she spoke, she picked up the teacup on the coffee table, took a sip, and continued: "In my boredom, I finally met an opportunity, the Tianjin Theater sent someone to invite me and my brother to Tianjin to play the leading role. My brother has already agreed, but I don't know why, he doesn't want to go. How can a girl go out alone! I was so anxious that I had to ask Master Zhu for help. Master Zhu refused. I pleaded again and again, saying: Master, since you love me so much, you still have to love me as before. I almost cried when I said it. Master Zhu was also very sad. He said it's a pity you are not a boy. If you were a boy, I would go all out to help you. Your father and brother are not easy to deal with. This time, for the sake of your future, I can't help but accompany you to Tianjin once, but this cannot be an example in the future." This difficult time was all thanks to Master Zhu's enthusiastic help, which got me through. When I returned from Tianjin, Master Zhu thought that since I was playing the leading role in Tianjin, it would hinder my future if I continued to play supporting roles and let others take the credit. In Beiping, I had to continue to play the leading role and sang a few shows boldly, all of which were sold out. From that time until now, I have officially lived a stage life. I am now learning the complete Wang Chun'e, as well as revising a few operas such as "Yang Guifei" and "Yu Tangchun." Every afternoon when I have time, I go to Master Zhu's house to learn opera and practice my skills."</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said: "Now that Boss Gu has become famous, the old man must be very satisfied." Qi Wan said: "No, my father has a bad temper and has been ill recently. He is still dissatisfied with me. I also feel that my art is still very immature and far from success." Zhu Zhai said: "You are too polite. I would be satisfied if I could sing one or two percent as well as you." Qi Wan said: "Don't say that." Just as she was about to say this, Xiao Wang's mother brought in cocoa and snacks. Qi Wan instructed everyone to eat some snacks while asking: "Mr. Xu, can you also tell me about your opera learning process?" Zhu Zhai said shyly: "I'm completely fooling around. I haven't formally studied under a teacher. Boss Fei is my uncle-in-law. I often go to his house. He sometimes tells me a few things, but it's a pity that he is a Sheng, and my voice is not suitable for singing Sheng." Qi Wan said: "It's very rare to be able to do this. Your voice is really good. If you study further, you will definitely become famous. But you don't need this. Do you work in an organization now?" Zhu Zhai said: "The business office of the Guogao Bank." Qi Wan said: "Who is in your family?" Zhu Zhai said: "My parents and my wife." After hearing this, Qi Wan looked at the lamp again, stared at it for a while, and then said: "Your wife must be very beautiful, right?" Just as Zhu Zhai was about to speak, he saw Xiao Wang's mother nudging Qi Wan slightly, wanting to ask her to leave. Qi Wan sat still and asked, "What's the matter? Tell me." Xiao Wang's mother said: "Director Lin has called twice in a row. I told him that you were not at home. Now he has sent a car to pick you up, saying that if you don't go, Director Lin will come in person." After hearing this, Qi Wan frowned and tapped the ground with the heel of her high-heeled shoe, saying: "I owe him money, let's go!" (End of Chapter Six)</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Explanation Refusal to Return Overdue for Three Years Despotic Local Tyrant Wields Power</p>
<p>Zhang Jinyi asks: In the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, my hometown fell and the enemy puppets were rampant. My late father was kidnapped because he had a slight reputation and was extorted for a large sum of money. Because it was impossible to raise the money at the time, he mortgaged ten mu of ancestral farmland to Shao, a fellow villager, for 4,400 yuan (puppet currency), with a term of three years. When the term expired, my late father asked someone to try to redeem it, but Shao refused on various pretexts. Last year, my father passed away and the family's economic situation became even more difficult. My mother asked someone to build up Shao again to redeem the land with three shi of white rice, but Shao relied on local power to insist that he would only consider it if he got fifteen shi of white rice. After the township head mediated, it was agreed to redeem it with six shi of white rice, but this number was still extremely considerable, resulting in a stalemate. There are several legal questions. I hope your lawyer can take the time to answer them so that I can follow them: Since the mortgage certificate was valued in currency (puppet currency) at the time, can it still be redeemed at the original price? If the number of shi is converted based on the grain price at that time, is there any legal basis? Does the government have any explicit provisions for the disposal of mortgages during the enemy puppet period? Now that it has been overdue for three years, can Shao be pursued for losses during the period of "refusal to redeem"? Is there any agency responsible for mediating this farmland mortgage dispute?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers] You can redeem it according to the mortgage price on the certificate. There is no legal basis. There is only the promulgation of supplementary regulations for handling civil lawsuits after the restoration. The provisions of Article 12 of the regulations only state that the court should fairly measure the judgment of increasing or decreasing the payment or changing other original effects, but there is no express provision for increasing by a certain number of times. The court often orders repayment at one or two thousand times. If the mortgagee refuses to redeem after the expiration date, the collected rent can be requested to be returned as unjust enrichment, but it cannot be converted into a mortgage price. Directly file a lawsuit with the judicial organ.</p>
