<h3>美加雙方軍事援華　談判將臨決定階段　馬卿返國注視長期計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕確息：美·加軍事援華之談判，在華府及南京進行以來，迄今將臨決定階段，雙方現正爲此事接觸頻繁，唯內容仍爲極大秘密。司徒大使原擬於聖誕節前飛平休假兩週，現已決定减少一周，於廿三日飛平，在燕園小住七日後，即行返京。一般推測，此或與中。美間各種援華談判之進行有關。又王外長十八日午後並曾約晤加大使戴爲世，密談頗久。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕參院撥款委員會昨夜十一時批准撥付緊急援外經費五億七千萬美元，較眾院批准之數多出六千一百萬元，其中除五億五千萬元援助法·義·奧三國外，二千萬元作爲援助中國之用，該案現已提交參院討論。國會定於今晚休會，參院開會特別提早一小時，以便在休會前可獲決定。關於援助中國部份，眾院決議與政府所提原案均未規定立即撥款，據參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇宣稱：本會此項決談，蓋因鑒於美國應使巾國政府繼續工作之重要，國務部明春正式提出援華法案後，國會或將增加撥款數目。</p>
<p>〔中央華盛頓十八日合眾電〕據政府官員稱：馬歇爾十九日自倫敦返比後，其注歲事頃之一，當爲長期援華計劃，而就各種跡象觀之，國務院最後提出之計劃，當遠較上月馬歇爾在國會中估計之三億元爲多。美國民間對援華計劃，興趣日濃，國會復力促採取行動，故迫使政府高級當局對此作重要之討論。</p>
<h3>杜魯門允向國會搖晃復興中國計劃　歡迎史達林赴美會晤</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統十九日要求援助遠東之復興，並特別提出中國，同時渠發表以一百七十億元充作馬歇爾計劃之基金，以重建歐洲。杜氏答應在國會於一月初開幕時，渠將提出一復興中國計劃。杜魯門稱：「目前吾人全力貫注西歐，蓋西歐爲此時世界上與和平將來有關最重要之地區，然吾人對戰後瘡痍滿目之亞洲，亦關切備至。美國在日本及朝鮮，曾大量援助，以維特生活及商業建設。戰爭結束後，吾人曾以各種重要援助給予中國，頗著勞績。美國應盡力繼續協助經濟平衡之恢復，作爲遠東復與之基礎。過去數月中，吾人則詳盡研究應付中國善後救濟特殊需要之方法。本人希望在國會下屆會紙中，將就其事向國會建議。」</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門總統今稱，如史達林願來華府，渠極歡迎與其會談，並謂：渠與史達林之間，最近並未互通消息。渠並深信，世界和平最後必可獲致，渠拒絕對四外長會議破裂一事發表評論，渠稱：馬歇爾將於明晚就此事向美國人民有所解釋。</p>
<h3>柯森主敎在費城宣稱　美前途繫於遠東　援華會以聖誕卡售款救濟我國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十九日廣播：華盛頓訊，曼薩居賽資州議員克拉遜，今日敦促立即授權以六千萬美元臨時援助給予中國，藉以解救中國當前之嚴重困難，並提出將此項款項作最有效利用之計劃。渠主張以三千萬美元購買食物，四百萬美元購買醫藥用品，一千五百萬美元購買衣着，五百萬美元購買肥料，五十萬美元購買種子，二百萬美元購買零星物品以及三百五十萬美元作爲運輸費用。克氏戰時爲軍士，目前爲商人，對中國向感興趣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社費城十九日電〕美以美會柯森主敎昨自遠東歸來談稱，除非美國放棄，遠東不致赤化，援助中國殊屬必要。中國在未統一以前，救濟工作價值之巨，難於估計。國府現正從事保衛戰，今後十二個月乃中國歷史上於嚴重時期。美國經濟前途繫於遠東，遠東在百年內供給最佳之傳敎機　，人民已準備接受生活新哲學，如不採取基督敎思想，整個世界前途影響極大。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十八日電〕援華聯合會循已往數年之舊例，現止發售聖誕卡片，售得之資，悉數作爲對華救濟與服務之計劃。按去年援華聯合會售去聖誕賀片約四十二萬張，得款三萬五千美元。本年之援華聖誕賀片色樣非常動人。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十八日電〕眾院民主萬仰袖麥考瑪克，十八日在眾院宣稱：「美國應立即予中國以軍事援助」。</p>
<p>渠稱，對中國政府之與共軍作戰，經濟援助固爲重要，而軍事供應，尤須提前。我人在遠東有許多軍用剩餘物資，頗可用之使中國抵擋侵略。</p>
<p>渠繼稱：「我人不應忘去中國使日本陷於兩綫作戰之功績」。渠承認中國政府「並非完全」者，然指責亦頗有言過其實之處，中國政府中即使有貪汚存在，然除去被共軍所佔之區域外，中國政府至少仍爲一自由政府。</p>
<h3>司使對援華建議　美國務院未漠視　美使館發表司氏談話</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京十九日電〕美國駐華大使館今晨宣布：最近有人向美國會委員會作證，謂美大使致國務院之電報，往往不獲回覆。司徒雷登大使爲此特發表評論如下：</p>
<p>「在余執行正常織務之過程中，余會以余所見之情形向國務院報告中國之局勢，並隨時提供建議。其中顯然述及援華問題。但此種通訊，類皆分門別類，余不得自由透露其內容。余從未感覺國務院方面對於答覆余之詢問或批評余之建議，有任何漠視或失禮之處」。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕據本市福音電台悉：蔣主席定本月廿一日（星期日）向國外廣播聖誕祝詞，主席之廣播詞，將灌成膠片，由行政院新聞局局長董顯光於是日携滬，假虎丘路福音電台，對國外廣播，董氏並將親赴該電台，以英語翻譯蔣主席之廣播詞。按該台波長爲一一二〇千週率。</p>

<h3>花紗布管制政策的再實施</h3>
<p>行政院為平抑物價，取締投機，除設置金融管理局平穩金融外，復以花紗布管理與物價關係至為密切，為嚴格執行管理政策，採行了全國經委會的方案，將經濟部原有之紡調會改組為全國花紗布管理委員會，推行代紡代織統購統銷政策，藉以加强生產，調劑供應，以利民生。本月五日政院臨時會議，通過花紗布管委會組織規程，並定　年元旦成立，主委一職將由袁良氏担任，其他人事，週內亦可發表。據政院新聞局董局長十七日發表談話，花紗布管理新機構成立後，紗廠與織廠將為政府生產，由政府配給棉花，為政府代紡代織，並由政府統購統銷。此為政府恢復戰時管理方針之大槪，惟一般民營紗廠反應不同，此項重大措施能否順利推行，收穫預期效果，端在今後新機構的如何努力。</p>
<p>經濟部紡管會之設，原為政府管理紡織業之機關，以限價的方法，控制紗布價格。今年六月改組為紡織事業調節委員會，由硬性的管制變為適度的調節，穩定紗價價格的方法，由限價變為議價。前在管制政策下，生產增加有限，原料時起恐慌，花紗黑市與限價日趨懸殊。致黑市壓倒官價，紡管政策宣告失敗；後來廢管制為調節，除見機構調整人事更迭外，並無若何顯著成績表現。十一月廿三日全國經委會通過『棉紗憑證聯合配銷綱耍』，準備以掌握紗布物資，繼續收購棉紗的方法，以行代紡代織，進而議定價格，設置調節公棧，以安定全國紗布市塲。這辦法公佈後，一方面激起了民營紡織業的反對，另方面又為複製工業所擁護，不久紡調會又有改組之說。新近繼物價漲風後，政府決定擴大配給日用品，決定採行戰時的辦法，加强花紗布管制，而迄一管制全國花紗布的重大責任，交付不久成立的花紗布管委會。很顯然的，這次的調整，不單是機構人事的更迭，而是管制政策進一步的全面發揮，意義自較重大。</p>
<p>依花紗布管委會組織規程所定，它的業務範圍包括甚廣，如全國棉花，棉紗，棉布之統籌購運及配銷，市塲供需之調節及價格之核定，原料及成品之增產與改良，原料之輸入及成品之輸出，乃至國營民營紡織工廠分區設立與原料產區之配合，均為其主要職掌。至管制方針，依政府擬定的計劃，所有紗廠將為政府代紡代織，政府保證其於支付工本及費用外，獲得合理之利潤。其實施管理之目標，不在建立營利之買賣機構，而在維護民衆利益，防止投機。照理論上說，花紗布屬於民生日用品，花紗布生產應為人民生產，花紗布經濟應為民生經濟，與每人民生活水準和生產要求，休戚相關。値此經濟國難嚴重之時，實施嚴正的統制，防止黑市投機，打擊物資囤積，應為很必耍的措施，問題郤在行政的效率，管制的步驟，以及民營紗廠的合作的態度；至於原料供應，品質技術，還是比較容易克服的問題。</p>
<p>關於原棉牛產問題，我國去年產量為七百四十三萬担，今年增加百分之五十，明年可能再增，加以美棉輸入，原料來源，似無匱乏之虞。我國紡織業共有四百五十萬舫錠，現開工者有三百六十萬錠，以紡錠計原料，每年共需原棉一千零八十萬担。此外手織業尚需二百五十萬担，綜計全部需要量為一千三百萬担。今後管委會統賺原棉，予以分配，論理應無問題。關於代紡代織，對紡織工廠生產活動有保障，祗要管制當局有通盤籌劃，原料供應公平，代紡費用公允，動力問題解決，並保障工廠無停工之虞，則民營紗廠似予以支持。關於管制紗布生產的目的，今天應以便利配給為主要，其次是成品的輸出。如果管制紗布生產之主要目的，是向國外市塲輸出，而非供應國內配給，不揣其本而齊其末，便離開了「經濟性的調整」，重返「政治性的管制」之路。這對於花紗布管制前途，似乎是很不利的。</p>
<p>總之，花紗布的全面管制，勢在必行；為平抑物價，防止投機，安定民生，實施配給，實為目前必要的措施。我們希望新機構的成立，以新的服務精神，機動的管理技術，負起這一重大的責任，以工作成績的表現，消釋民間之懷疑。戰時花紗布管理的失敗，非管制方針有錯誤，實由於行政效率的低落。戰後紡管會及紡調會的失敗，非限價或調節有錯誤，實由於投機操縱不法之風，中傷了政府的決策。現在新的管制機構成立，富有權力，以其責任之重大，不應再遭挫敗。我們謹以至誠，願當局能懍於過去的敎訓，知所警惕；一方面能站在國家民族的立塲，一方面能維護民營企業的權益，國計民生，兼籌並顧，則花紗布管制政策的實施，方可能逹到預期的效　。</p>

<h3>譚伯羽報告　交通進步困難</h3>
<p>（上接一版）譚伯羽氏報吿中，以事實說明當前交通進步之困難，首稱：半年來値動員戡亂，交通部所轄各部門，均日在破壞中，計</p>
<p>鐵路部份：全國鐵路共計三萬餘公里，本年一月間尙有一萬五千餘公里可通，目前續遭　壞，僅餘一萬三千餘公里可通車，惟華南新　之路已增四百公里。東北方面、北寗路十二月初全綫通車，但現又吿斷、三千餘公里路，僅一千三百餘公里通軍、華北方面，正太路自石家莊至太原、自十月起即已不通，膠濟路於去年十二月全綫修復，然僅兩月即又吿破壞、現自濟南至靑島已被截成三段，平綏路通車，至十一月由平至包頭尙有直逹車，平漢路在此一二月來破壞甚大，現南段不通，鄭州幾如孤州，北段亦已有七次修復之經過。保定以北部份，盼能在本月廿五日左右條復，平漢路至焦作之綫，今年初會條復，惟至四月又斷，現正設法修復中，俾能進而運用焦作之煤。華南方面，粤漢路自去年七月，因應軍事之需要，限期修通，但以設備簡陋，會有出執情事，浙贛路自金華至衢州，已於今年八月修通，為運輸糧食，計劃在年底自杭州直逹南昌，但因材料不足而未果，現盼於一月底村料運逹，則一月後可逹目的。津浦路現已於本月十二日通車，此次通車意義甚大，京滬原仰給開灤煤斤，因交通不便，而遭受極大影響，現可經膠濟路取用博山之煤，原成孤島之濟南，今亦可與外問媾通。</p>
<p>公路部份，因受外匯掛牌之更改，汽油之缺乏，物價之波動等等，不易改進，目前着重於司機訓練及軍輛登記等。舊路條理不易滿意，新路則僅脊新公路全長一千二百四十七公里，找海逹三千多公尺，由靑省府征民工所築，其進行情形，宛如一部西遊記，該路自西寗經倒淌河茫崖至南疆公路之金鴻山。</p>
<p>水運，目前有九十五萬一千餘噸之船隻，以上海佔大多數，航運部份民營者軍運佔百分之五，而國營部份大部份均為軍運，其對外洋之航路，招商局於本年七月已可駛非列賓，開中國旗在海面上至外洋去之光例。關於港口部份，有塘沽新港，葫蘆島等，均在盡力終建中。</p>
<p>航空部份，中國·中央兩航空公司，共有飛機八十三架，可飛者六十三架，今年一月以三十餘架機逹飛行四萬餘公里之紀錄，本月則以卅八架機飛行七萬八千公里。對外航綫，如中英·中美·中法·中荷。中　各綫均已簽約，惟暹邏尙未實行。現中國公司已於十一月十六日正式起飛至檀香山。舊金山，參加國際飛行，中央尙未可能，交通部於今年一月廿日成立民航局，對民航管理，已山民航局管制。</p>
<p>電　部份，計經過四千餘次破壞，損失一千四百七十噸銅綫，被偷二百餘噸綫。此次石家莊失陷損失自動機一千五百架，銅錢二百噸，其主持修復工程之人員曾調：自北平至保定八次大修理，其所用之綫，可修建五千多公里對綫，自本年七月始，我已可興美直接　話，郵政部份，則日求進步中。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統十九日正式要求國會通過將一百七十萬萬元撥交馬歇爾計劃，以重建西歐以維護自由及防止另一次戰爭。總統以長達九千言之咨文提交國會，籲請國會以美國金元及生產力資助馬歇爾計劃，使能維持至一九五二年。杜氏稱，馬歇爾計劃之採納將為「自由人民團結一致，抵抗極權壓力，保衛自由之基業，提高全人類生活水準之證據」。杜魯門總統要求國會撥發基金，以資助歐洲十六國互助復興之努力。渠估計在援歐程度開始後十五個月內，至少需要六十八萬萬元，該期自日年四月開始，至後年六月底為止。杜氏指出，此數使及美國在二次大戰中用費百分之五。渠稱，在馬歇爾計劃有效期間，美國國家收入之百分之三，即將超過此數。總統稱：「美國繼續援助歐洲國家其基本目標為協助各該國達到經濟自給之境。而以全力貢獻世界之和平繁榮」。杜氏稱，歐洲復興計劃與聯合國憲章之原則悉然相符。「自由國家聯合努力，推進世界和平。任何一國，如為私利而圖阻礙破壞歐洲，顯然與此目的相悖」。杜氏指出：「東歐數政府曾受邀參加巴黎會議共商縱濟合作，絕參加。彼等之不參預使復興努力益形艱難。另一方面，無疑將延長彼等自身之經濟困此並不足以阻止東西歐間貿易之恢復，蓋有利於雙方也」。特別國會將於十九日晚休會年一月六日重開。此次會議係通過緊急援歐法案。杜氏咨文適於特別國會　後一日　　，國會於一月六日將澈底硏究杜氏之要求。同時，甚至在年關休假中，兩院任何員會均可隨時開始硏究。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門在今日呼籲通過馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃之演說中稱：「遠東對美國之輸出，有助於歐洲對遠東各國輸出之償付，故歐洲實為世界貿易網中之重要一環」。</p>
<h3>推行計劃六要點　預定四年歐洲各國自給自足增加生產促進普遍繁榮</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統稱，推行此計劃時，有六大基本要點：　「本計劃係在一規定時期內促進普遍之復興。　「本計劃係在使吾人供給之金錢及貨物以最有效之方法用以復興歐洲。　「本計劃一方面擬「减省美國之財政代價，另一方面，擬避免使歐洲國家負擔不能長期勝任之財政重擔。　「本計劃起草時注意保留美國之資源，同時减少由援歐吾國經濟所受之不幸後果。　「本計劃力求與美國其他國際關係及責任相合無悖。　「本計劃之實施擬求其實施能睿智而有效」。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統强調「使歐洲自給自足」之重要性。渠稱，其基太問題茲為「增加歐洲之生產。十六國在其報吿中曾提出一復興計劃，預計在四年後，歐洲可以自給自足，且能維持一合理之最低限度生活水準而無需外來之援助。本計劃根據下列四基本要點：　參加各國之强度生產努力。　各國促進國內財政穩固。　參加國家不斷最高度相互合作。。參加國與南北美洲貿易缺額之解決，特別着重增加歐洲之出口。</p>
<p>參加十六國家　應守七大條件</p>
<p>杜魯門立下援多七大廣泛條件，包括規定在十六參與國國內及商業出口需要之外，更協助美國原料之積聚。杜氏吿國會稱，每一馬歇爾計劃國家均保證採取個別及集體行動以達到復興。杜氏並提出下列條件（除開不可能應用之處）：　「促進農工業生產」使能脫離反常之外來經濟協助。　相互合作「以减除彼此之間貿易上障礙及促進貨物及贈與物之交換」　「平衡通貨，建立或維持對其貨幣制之信心。」　有效利用美國貨品及贈與物。　「加强規定原料之生產，優待美國取得原料供堆積，以免超出國內合理用途及商業出口需要。」　「以相等於贈與援助品價格之本國通貨存入特別帳戶，須在兩政府相互同意後，始得加以動用。」　「有關美援及各參加國間及參加國與美國間協定之發展之消息，應在國內發表，並供給美國。」</p>
<h3>援助方式　分貸款與贈與</h3>
<p>然杜氏警吿稱：「如吾人前時之援助之運用不當，美國當然保留停止援助權。」渠稱，援品一部份以贈與方式，一部份以貸款方式，而其標準則為每國之償還力。有力以現款購買進口品或償還貸款之國家，將不能獲有贈與。其後為平衡貨幣計可能需要特別貸款，然現時尙不能加以估計。杜氏又稱，計劃推動之</p>
<h3>推行馬歇爾計劃　成立經濟合作部　受援國應將戰略品售與美國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美政府提出之馬歇爾援外計劃中各項法案有關之各要點如下：「計劃」迄於一九五二年六月二十日，美國將以一百五十一億至一百七十八億元，協助歐洲復興。「國會所要求者」規定整個全期美國援外款項為一百七十億元，然自一九四八年四月一日開始之首先十五個月中，僅能撥款六十八億元，而漸漸削减至最後十二個月為二十二億元，在國會開始撥款前，先付五億元，預先運送供應品。應得援助之國家包括奧，比，丹，愛，法，希，冰島，義，盧，荷，挪，葡，英，土，瑞典與瑞士等國。「德國之貢獻」復活德國西部之工業資源以援助西歐之復興，然提防軍國主義之復活。為此在開始十五個月中軍部將另撥八億二千二百萬元以逹到此目的。「政治條件」如某國之政治情形有所變動時，美國可決定其能否繼續獲得美國之援助。「管理機構」成立一新機構定名為經濟合作部，名義上與政府其他各部平等，然凡有關於外交各點則受國務卿之管制。「美戰略必需品」歐洲各國及其殖民地應將重要戰略必需材料售與美國即付以現款，以增加該項物品之生產。際，私人之觀察所得當愈形重要。此計劃要求「美國人民稍作自我犧牲」，然不必過分誇張此負祖，蓋此計劃「吾人綽然力能担任。」杜氏將馬歇爾計劃所需與美國國家收入作一比較後稱，「此乃對世界和平安全及未來優良生活之期望信念之投資，其代價實在不大。」杜氏特別宣稱，美國無意與其他美洲國業失却連繫，「本人特別希望指出，吾人目前對西歐工作之聚精會神，而吾人與西半球各鄰國間長期經濟合作之興趣並不因之减少。吾人身為美洲國家之一，美洲各國現正採取與歐洲國家類似之合作行動，故吾人必須增加生產，以推動財政平衡及消除貿易壁壘。吾人幸在美洲，此方面已有相當成就，然吾人不應忽略更形進步之機會，歐洲復興計劃要求西半球甚多國家予以供應。此舉將刺激生產及商業及促進吾人繁榮以賴之世界貿易之建立。」</p>
<h3>確定樂觀信念　應付共黨策略</h3>
<p>杜魯門批評包圍馬歇爾計劃之歐洲氛圍稱：「吾人不應忽視，共黨業已宣布其決心，將反對一切復興歐洲之努力。今後必將　有罷工發生，目的不在解除某種團體之困難，而在製造紊亂，希望能藉此逹到極權控制；反之，如信念及樂觀心理能及早確定，則星星之火，可以燎原，而歐洲復興之進展亦可因之而大形加速。」</p>
<h3>美與歐洲·貿易差額　今後四年內將逾二百億</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕與杜魯門總統發表咨文之同時，美國務院亦發表一報吿，估計一九四入年四月一日至一九五二年六月卅日，歐洲與西半球之貿易差額，將逹一百九十四億至二百廿一億。報吿中稱，為彌補是項差額，故杜魯門總統將要求國會以一百七十億之數援歐，其餘不足之數將由增加進出口銀行與世界銀行貸款，以及其他西半球各國之捐助補足之。國務院之報吿中稱，自明年四月一日開始後十五個月之中，歡洲可望自美國獲得製麵包榖類五百廿萬公噸，粗榖八十萬噸，脂肪油類廿萬噸，肉類四十萬噸，糖七十萬噸，牛乳類十五萬噸，乾菓類五千噸氮氣三千公噸。</p>

<h3>浙江農業建設在躍進中　全省行政會議以後</h3>
<p>（本報杭州十八日訊）在江動亂的局面下，浙江省雖然可以算得不　，但想要專設，也　談何容易。自從省主席沈成章氏接任以來，前後會召開過兩次的行政會　，第一次在卅五年的新秋，第二次就在卅六年的十二月，我們檢査第一次行政會議的成果，除了吏治，交通，敎育等都有進步外，覺得苛雜　派確是已在取消了。</p>
<p>錢江海塘工程</p>
<p>也確已完成了第一步，曹娥江流城，確已完成防洪各項工程十處，浦江流域，確已完成防洪各項工程十二處，東老溪流域，確已培修提塘十五處，補修涵洞一百四十二處，西召漢流域，完成各項疏　工程八處。大型農田水利工程方面，寗波東錢湖一二兩期工程，確已如期完成，寗海軍在港工程，完成了三孔水閘一座，引河土方五萬餘公方，永瑞陸門，完成了六座。興辦小型農田水利工程者有五十五縣，各項工程計為六百二十八處。雖然，這其間是得力於行總的麺粉甚多，但畢竟還要為政人員的努力，庶幾這許多麵粉能够發生了工賑的效率。浙江雀，無疑的爲農業的省份，所以我們特別提出關於水利工程建設的完成，實在可以說政府當局把握到了重點。不過，留下的浙江農業問題澴很多，例如農具的改良，畜牧的改進，荒地的墾殖，農業特產的再硏究，優良農作物種子的廣泛介紹，道也都是極其重要的工作。大凡做一件事，離不了財與人，其中尤以人為主要。今天浙江省的農業，更當以人為最，所以農林水利的專門人才，應該多加羅致與訓練，分發各縣應用。我們看到沈主席對卅六年全省行政會議審査會前對有關重要問題的指示中，特別提出說農林水利的專門人才，其待遇將特別提高，這實在也可以說是建設浙江農業的</p>
<p>養財用才之道</p>
<p>浙江省　然農業有了長足的進步，則財富更為富裕，財富充裕，盜賊無由而生，貪污舞弊事件即無由而起，則敎育大興，人民可以安居樂業。所以今天浙江的唯一積極要政，當在建設，而建設的首要，當在改良和建設農業。卅五年度全省行政會議的結果，消極的是廢除了苛雜攤派，積極的是興辦了若干農田水利的建設，我們更熱望卅六年的行政會議的結果，消極的全省公務員沒有一個貪汚舞弊，積極的全省的糧食大量增產，特產品大為改良，農具達到了現代化的程度。</p>
<p>記者始終認為在目前以農業為基礎的浙省各級學校，應該特別加强農業常識的灌輸，同時對於目己的鄉土有特別淸楚的認識。我們熱望政府分派幹員到各鄉村去，大家齊心合力於農村的建設事業，定期舉行競賽，以觀厥成　關於農業建設的另一重要問題，就是</p>
<p>自耕農的扶植</p>
<p>政府目前實行的二五减租，有若干縣確已收到效果，但還有許多地方，仍舊沒有徹底實行，我們應該統計全縣荒地，獎勵墾殖，同時用政府的力量特別獎勵自耕農，使自耕農漸漸的多起來，得以眞正做到平均地權。不過這個工作也要為政的人親自下鄉與農民接觸，才能收到效果。</p>
<p>我認爲，在今天動亂的時代裏，我們浙江要求到在動亂中安定</p>
<p>在安定中建設</p>
<p>這當然是件不容易的事情，但是我們只要想安定的單位是什麽？當然離不了人民，在浙江百分之八十以上是農民，我們只要把農村安定好，一切都沒有問題的。</p>
<p>卅五年的全雀行政會議已經揭露了浙江農業建設的光明，卅六年的全省行政會議後，我們企望在沈主席的領導下，更把浙江全省農業的建設，推進了千百步。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>家族觀念太強儋縣機關未息</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島十六日航訊〕海南島備縣械鬥，歷數十年，往往因而店舍成墟，妻學戮辱，彼此互相殘殺，致釀成地方大患，雖迭經地方行政常局予以勸導或阻遏，均因成見已深，此風迄未稍殺。日前該縣旅居海口人士，特舉行座談，商謀解決途徑，常時並擬訂四項具體辦法，提供專員韓漢英採納。本報記者為明瞭該縣械鬥始末，特趨訪某方人士，據稱：該縣之械鬥，目前已至</p>
<p>根深蒂固</p>
<p>程度，致一朝消　於無形，勢有不可。械鬥一事，由來已久，　其遠因，則因淸室未葉，有沙井村王某，獲進士後，即橫行鄉曲，恃勢凌辱鄉民，任意　佔良田，强刧民妻，民衆恨之入骨。有鄰村唐帝村拔貢吳某，目睹王某之　勢橫行，乃起而代鳴不平，並控於當時之知事李熙，李知事即傳審雙方，該王某復</p>
<p>咆哮公堂</p>
<p>開怒知事，即加以十大罪名，將王某　市於儋。從此吳王兩族，遂結下仇恨種子，引起激烈之械鬥。嗣後又因地理環境親戚關係等有利於己之條件，各結</p>
<h3>銅山團管區軍需　李叔美潛逃截獲</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十九日電〕蘇北師管區銅山團管區司令部一等軍需李叔美，近因故免職，詎李抗不辦理移交，乘隙逃匿。今日被縣警局刑警隊根據密報拘獲，李直認潛逃不諱。警局已電銅山團管區派員來蘇迎提歸案。黨派，各樹門戶以對立，乃株連至吳·陳·黎·何等十八姓。與王。李。符。唐。孫·羊等廿四姓，械鬥乃愈演愈烈，總至不可收拾。迨至民國十七年間，兩敗俱傷，雙方元氣大失，事始稍息。及至民廿一年，神确坑陳何雨姓，又因石木之爭而至械鬥，因常時調解人調解無效，乃將陳姓魁首陳某槍決，故又引起陳何之世仇。民廿四年，三都境陳吳兩姓，又因爭石而械鬥。敵人登陸前，三都境又有陳羊兩姓之械鬥。勝利後，又以種種複雜原因，雙方未能</p>
<p>破除成見</p>
<p>甚或因藉故傾軋攻計，致械鬥之風，迄未稍殺。總之，儋縣之械鬥，雖遠因近因不一，然一般民衆之家族觀念太强，封建色彩太濃厚，致雙方不能破除舊嫌，共結新歡，實為最大因素。</p>

<h3>國行請禁現鈔流滬　財部將令海關切實檢查</h3>
<p>自國家行周奉令限制匯兌以後，各地資金仍不斷流入本市。其方式　商業行莊之匯款，　携運現鈔。但商業行莊因受國家行局限制，為數不多，泰半仍以現鈔運滬。現鈔來路亦有三種：　輪船，　火車，　飛機，即海陸空三種工具，均儘量利用。據悉：現鈔運滬數量極鉅，非正式統計，週內逹三千億以上。政府前為限制資金南流，曾嚴禁現鈔運穗，其他各地，未受限制。巾央銀行為免激動市塲，特電商財部速予査禁。財部以職責所在，將有具體辦法。間將責令海關切實檢査，如有携帶大批現鈔者，一經査出，即予沒收。</p>
<p>行莊繳有準備金　財部令依法辦理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀錢業同業公會刻奉財政部令開：「査銀行法業經公佈施行，關於行莊繳存準備金，自應依據銀行法之規定，並參酌現在情形，規定實施辦法如次：　銀錢行莊收受普通存款儲蓄存款應繳存之準備金，嗣後應依照銀行法規定，一律改稱保證準備金。　各地商業銀行存款準備金比率，暫定活存百分之十五，定存百分之十。　實業銀行比率，應俟依法調整業務確定性質後，再行核定。目前一律暫照上項商業銀行標準繳存。　省縣市銀行暫照銀行法內實業銀行之規定辦理，定為活存百分之十二，定存為百分之八。　準備金得以公債庫券抵充，惟不超過應繳總額百分之五十。至債券作價，國幣債券，應照票面七折計算，外幣債券，應照繳存或調整日公佈外匯市價五折計算。　保證準備金之調整，仍照向例，每月一次。以前儲稱存款之保證準備，係每三個月調整一次，應併改為每月一次。上列各項，均自卅七年一月一日起實行。銀錢業同業公會奉令後，業已通函各行莊査照云。</p>

<h3>行局差入較少　銀根緊勢略緩　十日以來差入總額逾萬億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨雖有捲烟稅款收入，惟結果僅差入一七八億，故銀根緊勢已稍緩和，暗息續跌至二角五分，惟華股塲外多方貼息反昻至三角六分。各行局中，中央差入四一七億，大交換入四七五億，外商入四八五億，小交換出一○九八億，其他行局出入差參半。</p>
<p>自十日新版親金券發行迄今，行局每日均有鉅額差入。迄昨日為止，總額已差人逹一○四九九億元，內現鈔約佔八千五百億元。聞小交換逐日鉅額差出，大多均以現鈔解繳。而自國家行局限止內匯後，外埠客商來此辦貨，均隨帶大額現鈔來滬，小交換行莊亦賴以週轉。故此次銀根緊風，金融圈內尙屬平稱云。</p>
<h3>華股漲勢蓬勃　臨收竸爭尤烈　昨後市臨時停做</h3>
<p>華股昨繼續向榮，永紗迭創新高價。小型股銳氣未泯，仍吿炙手可熟。大通中泥華豐五和次第漲逹限度，中途因午後臨時由所方通吿停做，一度微回，但無關大勢。臨收時多空為收市價競爭更烈，形同肉搏，此稱現象，頗堪十注意。</p>
<p>晨初即因外匯牌價之掛大而見高，永紗以四八○元及四九五元之價開市。開後七一號六五號一二號一一六號一○六號均進，升至四八八元及五○○元。八九號二三二號脫手，退至四八○元及四九○元。二一八號九五號二○六號八五號來進，升至四九一元及五○○元，大通二日由五二號掛漲停，三二號一七八號脫手，但四號七六號三五號一七三號一○四號仍進，升至四九四元及五二○元。塲外息價開三角一分半及三角六，五四號三二號一七八號一六三號一五二號八五號紛紛脫手，證交臨時決定下午停做，散多有了，曾降至即交四七九元，遞交四八七元低價。中泥由八二號掛漲停，一一六號二○七號五四號一七六號連袂吸收，一五七號亦進，再起漲風。華豐亦由二一二號掛漲停，永紗乃見即交四九五元，遞交五○三元新高價。九一號一一七號七六號八五號紛紛脫手，臨收競爭甚烈，仍以四八五元及四九六元之價于收市。結果較前收即交股華豐漲停後有回，軋升一成。勤興漲一成半，華新中紡榮豐統益美亞中絲商務新光景綸麗安景福升半成，中泥大通五和漲停板，餘均小漲。遞交股計華豐漲停，景福勤興各升一成，表光美亞漲半成，永紗信和微升。塲外各老股仍吿　昂，尤以文化股為最甚。</p>
<h3>統債微升　外股堅穩</h3>

<p>外股昨尚屬　局，怡紗農開四一五○○○元，午刻盤上至四二五○○○元結束。合盛洋行及廣帮洋商咸進，證券帮供售。電車在調整公用事業聲中獨俏，結果較前收計祥泰尙平，紙版微挫，電車昂一成，怡紗英聯會德　業廣怡　航業　業電話均吿微升，港電仍站三元半，形勢頗穩。</p>
<h3>市場限現欵交易　食米昨市勢挫降　麵粉雜糧食油均上升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因天氣轉晴，來源較暢，各路客貨絡繹來滬，市塲到貨登記共一萬二千餘石。產地價格回軟，散戶均有吐售，又因市塲奉令，昨今二日祇限現鈔交易，以是頭寸不寬者無力收購，勢呈疲降，各檔收市價格，平均較上日跌一二萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，昨天氣放晴，人心頓虛，米市激降。貨主脫意頗濃，開市即為賣氣所籠眾，價格遂見抑低。無錫白粳，回進百萬關，為九十七萬元。薄稻價為九十六萬，秈米亦降二三萬元，白元陰元均見下降。</p>
<p>麵粉又見騰踊，因小麥價格巳高逹五十二萬，廠方以成本高，故廠盤亦高，月不多開出，價乃直上。麩皮市價趨升，小麥所升亦多。</p>
<p>雜糧一致此秀，貨主寗守而不售，豆餅止疲轉昂，升七八千至萬地，黄豆挺萬餘元，平湖豆特組以六十二萬成交，揀靑　銷暢，再升二萬元。苞米漲勢更厲，北帮納殷，猛升三萬元。紅糧亦昻約萬元，菉豆稍昂五千，芝蔴初平後升，軋挺三萬，生仁上升四五萬，豇豆赤豆均見稍升。</p>
<p>食油昨市，開後節節高昇，至收市猶堅俏不已，結果上升甚鉅。因成交後須至下週一交割，故貨主脫意甚淡，喊價均見挻升。大有廠豆油，初開一百九十萬，後步高至一百九十五萬收市，計升十四萬元。生油升十萬，菜油一致上挺，小車蔴油亦挺十萬元</p>
<p>食糧市塲　照常學業</p>
<p>今日銀錢業封關總結算，本市棉紗棉布市塲及證券市塲均停止營業一日。而米，油，雜糧市塲仍照常營業。惟規定今日成立之交量，一律需以現鈔支付云。</p>

<p>棉紗堅挺</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以銀根緊鬆靡定，兼以美匯提高，人心轉堅，各方納意驟濃，塲內喊進之聲為多。四十二支藍鳳細紗，曾哄高至四千八百萬元，嗣因浮多獲利吐售，臨收回低至四千七百六十萬，但較之上日，則回漲二百四十萬元。其餘各支精細紗亦均回升，自三四十萬至二百餘萬不等。</p>
<p>布疋上升</p>
<p>棉布市况，昨晨初開時，因　夜浮多了結，交易淸稀，行淸上落甚微，詎至十時後，聞美　掛高，人心轉趨堅挺，天津帮及山西帮縱來收吸，各方納胃展開，喊價哄抬逾恒。迨至結果，十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，狂漲五萬五至八萬三千元之鉅，此外漂布嗶嘰直貢粗布細料等行情，京　升二·三萬至十萬左右，其餘各布脚地亦趨挻秀。</p>

<h3>戰前存欵發還倍數　金融業請速行核定　特種營業稅開徵技術將酌予改進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前存款發還　計給之倍數問題，前雖經行政院通過處理辦法草案，業經定為一千七百倍，惟尙待立法院完成立法程序，方能正式施行。茲聞立法院以改組在即，右將此案暫擱可能。而本市金融業方面，認為此案未便久懸不決，特推請銀行業公會理事長李馥蓀，於日前晋京，催請速行核定施行。</p>
<p>又銀錢業之特種營業稅問題，要求减低一說，刻已不可能。惟聞開徽技術，或可酌予改進，現銀錢業方面對改進徵收技術之意見有三：　按利息收入加手續費收入，再减利息支出加手續費支出，作為計算標準。　分支行莊特種營業稅，由總行莊彙交。現因上海各行莊開徽特稅，係自本年七月份起計算。其他各地，則自五月份起計算。　由銀錢業每戶將月報表呈送財部，請即根據該項月報表計算應納特稅額，勿再分別査賬。聞上述三項意見，一二兩項，可望當局接受考慮，三項恐無接受可能。本市各行莊三十六年下半年特稅，計徵日期自七月一日起，至十二月三十一日。現已定自明年一月十日起，開始申報。據估計：營業額最大之一家商業銀行，約須繳特稅逹十一億。預計全市銀行業可繳之特稅額，當在三百億元左右云。</p>

<h3>談佛與翻譯文學（上）</h3>
<p>— 周一良</p>
<p>梁　皎高僧傳卷貳鳩摩羅什傳記載這位姚秦時代譯經大師對於翻譯的意見，說「改梵為秦，失其漢蔚。雖得大意，殊隔文體。有似嚼　與人，非徒失味，乃令　喊也。」翻譯聖手如羅什還這樣說，我們若要用文學眼光來研究翻譯的佛典，豈不是想在別人嚼過的飯裏找滋味嗎？嚴格說起來，當然沒有一部翻譯作品能代替原文。但中國翻譯佛典從後漢到北宋，有一千多年的歷史。參加的人那樣衆多，所譯佛典的內容那樣廣泛。同時這些經典原本存在的更是鳳毛麟角，究全靠着譯本流傳。世界上任何語言裏，恐怕都沒有這樣性質的一堆翻蹕文學！儘管是嚼過了的飯，依然有重新咀嚼的價値，那是毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>我國讀書人對於「異端」「二氏」的書籍，向來不屑寓目。淸代史學大家如錢大昕，其造詣可謂精深博大，但他在潛硏堂金石文跋尾裏，考訂唐代勾當京城諸寺觀修功德使的建置年代，因為不曾參考佛敎徒的記載，所以竟犯了極不該犯的錯誤。是一個很好的例十。近幾十年來學風丕變，一方面發現許多新資料，一方面從前人所不注意的資料也都有人來利用了。談佛敎哲學和佛敎史的人固然得看大藏經，就是研究歷史或中西交通的學者，也莫不由佛家著述獲得不少有用的材材。唯獨治文學或文學史的人，對於翻譯佛典還未能充分利用，這就是這篇小文想要談的。</p>
<p>胡適之先生在他的白話文學史中，曾　專　討論佛典翻譯文學，並舉例說明，可謂獨具卓識。沈從文先生的小說集月下小景和蘇雪林先生的劇本鳩那羅的眼睛，以及故去的許地山先生的若干短篇小說，都是取材於翻譯佛典，而很成功的。都可謂空谷之足音。我現在想就三個觀點，來看佛典翻譯文學。</p>
<p>第一是當純文學看。譬如妙法述華經裏的火宅喻一段，原文便是極優美的文學作品，而羅什譯文也頗足以傳逹原文的情趣。如叙起火云：「於後舍宅，忽然火起。四面一時，其炎俱熾。棟樑椽柱爆聲震裂。摧折墮落，牆　崩倒。諸鬼神等，揚聲大呌。離鷲諸烏鳩槃荼等，周章惶怖，不能自出。惡獸毒蟲藏竄孔穴。」寫得很有點如火如荼的意思。馬鳴的佛所行讚是以詩的體裁來敘佛一生，原文尙存半部，在梵文學史上，也是數一數二的名作。譯者現在一般認為是北凉沮渠氏時東來的中天竺僧人曇無讖，其中尙有問題，這兒姑不討諭。這個譯本論忠實論文藻都不如羅什，然而也未始不可以窺見原文文學意味。如厭思品叙述國王不得不許太子出游，又怕他看見老病醜穢而生厭離心：「王見太子至，摩頭瞻顏色。悲喜情交結，口許而心留。」寫得很細繳。只是「摩頭」原文是Sirasyupa-gliraya，原指印度一種連嗅帶吻的禮節而言。譯文為適合中國國情，於是不作「鳴頭」而作「摩頭」了。又如合宮憂悲品叙太子人山修道，御者車匿和白馬歸來，太子妃耶輪陀羅責駕車匿說：「生亡我所欽，今為在何所？人馬三共行，今唯二來歸！我心極惶怖，戰慄不自安。終是不正人，不昵，非善友，不吉，縱强　！應芙，用啼為？將去而啼還，反覆不相應！……故使聖王子，一去不復　。汝今應大喜，作惡果成，寗近智　怨，不習愚痴友。假名為良朋，內實懷怨結！今此勝工家，一旦悉破壞！」雖然不如原文之暢逹，也足以表見一個女子的辛辣口吻。「生亡我所欽」是據高麗藏本，宋元明三本都作「共我意中人」。案原文相常於這一句的是Gatah　kvasa　chandaka　manmanorathah。意為「車匿」，我心所悅之人何在？」宋元明三本之「意中人」或者比」我所欽」反而近眞。</p>
<p>以上所舉兩種恰巧都是原文還存在的。還有原文不復存在，我們只能由譯文來欣賞的，可以用劉宋寶雲譯佛本行經作代表。這也是一部佛傳，其中與眾婇女游居品叙述太子妃夜間作夢，夢見太子捨棄了她，自已入山林。她「追呼不息，太子入林。心意發狂，樹樹行求。嗥向樹曰：「汝獨無憂，我獨懷惱！示我太子！」仰見樹上有赤嘴鳥。向鳥　苦：「我失所怙，汝聲似之，紫聲與汝！願以鳴聲除我心惱！』又見樹日：「汝何不慈？吾厄失怙，迷行犯觸，賢夫所棄。宜見慰傷，如何見芙？花盍開敷！」…為風所動，樹枝傾曲。「猶如以堂擊打於我！」鳥獸角視：「爾不遣夫！」水聲如駡：「我不任治太子不還！」便悲歡曰：「留目紺蓮，……留芙華敷，留顏金華，留髮辟兵，我見遺忽！」口言未止，忽見太子於林樹間。便前據曰：「何為相棄？」語頃驚覺，抱持太子，慚懼戰疚。」這一段裏有若干句頗為費解，在未找到更好的本十校勘誤字，或合適的材料來解說之前，我們只可缺疑。但就能了解的地方看來，這段描寫也已經很有詩意，很富於幻想了。梵文文學最喜用雙關語，這兒的無憂原文定是Asoka，是樹名，也有無憂的意思。留目云云是說太子走後給別的都留下紀念，可以據以追念他，只有自己不曾得到。金華指無憂樹的花，釋迦牟尼三十二相裏有一相就是「膚體柔軟細滑紫磨金色」，此所以「留顏金華」也。所謂「辟兵」也許是風俗通荊楚歲時記等書上所說的「辟兵繒」。這自然是用中國固有的專物來比附西國事物，如義凈所舉以楊枝譯Dantakastha之此。但原文是什麼我還未能斷言，也許是婆羅門身上所佩的帶子？以上僅是隨意舉幾個例，佛典裏能找到的有文學意味的篇章，當然還有許多。將來編文學史的人，至少寫中古文學史的人，一定要給佛典翻譯文學一個重要的地位吧？</p>
<h3>談西洲曲</h3>
<p>— 游國恩</p>
<p>樂府　曲歌辭有西洲曲一首，題為「古辭」。或以為梁武帝作的，或以為江淹作的，其實皆非也。他是一首地道的江南民歌，六朝文人斷斷乎不能贊一辭。不但他的作風非文人所能髣髯，單就篇中『卷簾天自高，海水搖空綠」十個字而論，恐怕連盛唐人也模仿不出來，六朝時的作者如何能夢想得到呢？</p>
<p>但我現在並不想討論西洲曲的作者問題，而所要提出的乃是這樣通俗的民歌，一般讀者們所最容易忽略的問題，甚至連解釋都成問題的問題。讓我先把這首歌辭的全文鈔在下面：</p>
<p>「憶梅下西洲，折梅寄江北。單衫杏子紅，　鬢鴉雛色。西洲在何處？雙獎橋頭渡。日暮伯勞飛，風吹烏柏樹，樹下即門前，門中露翠鈿。開門郞不至，出門採紅蓮。採蓮南塘秋，蓮花過人頭。低頭弄蓮子，蓮子淸如水。置蓮懷袖中，運心徹底紅。憶郞郞不至，仰首望飛鴻。鴻飛滿西洲，望郞上靑樓；樓上望不見，盡日闌干頭。闌千十二曲，埀手明如玉。卷簾天自高，海水搖空綠。海水夢悠悠，君愁我亦愁。南風知我意，次夢到西洲。」我要先問：</p>
<p>（一）起頭兩句是女子的口氣呢？還是男子的口氣？</p>
<p>（二詩中女主角的家—西洲是在江北，還是在江南？</p>
<p>（三）如果在江南，那麼篇末「南風知我意，次夢到西洲」二名應該如何講法？</p>
<p>（四）如果在江北，那兩句又該如何講法？</p>
<p>（五）「海水夢悠悠」以下四句是誰的口氣呢？</p>
<p>（六）如果是男子的口氣，則那位男子是在江南，而女子却在江北。</p>
<p>（七）如果是女子的口氣，豈不明明是女子在江南，男子在江北嗎？這樣，西洲却又變成男子的家了。以上那些問題，必須要有了正確的答案，這首詩方才可以講得通，才不至於前後自相矛盾。</p>
<p>這首詩最難講的地方是起頭兩句和煞尾四句。起頭兩句說：「憶梅下四洲，折梅寄江北。」這是誰的口氣呢？我以為這當然是男子的口氣，他應該這麼講：我（男子）現在正想念着你，（女子）很想到西洲來看看你。而你呢，却恰好寄了一枝梅花來，以　我的想念。眞巧啊！上一句的憶梅是男子的事，下一句的寄梅是女子的事。上一句就男子說，下一句就女子說。於是我便想到了一點：這兩個「梅」字斷斷不是應便用的。那「梅」字很可能就是那位女子的名或姓。所以當着他的情人想念着他的時候，他就馬上寄了一枝梅花給他，教他見物如同見了人一樣。所以我假定憶梅和寄梅必是屬於男女雙方的事，而不應看作片面的事。我以為必須如此謝，起頭兩句才有意義，不然，旣說憶梅，又說寄梅，無諭男女任何一方面，在事實上都講不通。</p>
<p>憶梅與寄梅旣然被確定了為男女雙方的事，所以很自然的也就確定了那女的是住在西洲，（詩中更有明文可證。）而男的則住在江北。因而更知道：那位男的旣住在江北，則女的所住的西洲必在江南，男女雙方的住所及其方位都弄淸了，然後這首詩的一切問題大體上也就迎刃而解了</p>
<p>原來是這樣的：一個住在江北的男子，忽然想起了他的愛人來，意識的馬不斷的在腦子裏兜圈子。所以這首詩就從一個「憶」字設起，以下便總是「憶」他的話。「單衫査十紅，　鬢鴉雛色，」是憶他的服裝和儀容，「西洲在何處」至『門中露翠鈿』，是憶他的家門和裝飾。「開門郞不至」至『盡日闌千頭，』是憶他的生活和心緒，並且憶及他無時無刻不在想念他的情人。「闌干十二曲」四句，則不但憶及他的住所的構造，而且憶及那住所的風景。『卷簾天自高，海水搖空綠」二句同上文「樓高望不見，盡日闌干頭」兩句配合起來，便有「曲終人不見，江上數峯靑」的神味。柳子的「悠悠乎與灝氣俱，而莫得其涯；洋洋乎與造物者遊，而不知其所窮。」「心凝形釋，與萬化冥合，」也彷彿與此同一境界，　眞是詩中神品。詩中旣然從「梅」說起，而梅又是冬春時的花，於是便順着一年中的時令，依次序的「憶」下去。於是而出門採運，置之懷袖；於是而仰望飛鴻，登樓四望。因為採蓮是夏秋間的事，（當然也有子夜讀曲等歌以「蓮」為「憐」的諧聲作用。）而飛鴻是在秋冬才有的。（當然也有盼望音書和願為鴻鵠飛去的意思。）「南塘秋，」明明點出季候，「天高』二字也是暗點秋景。（「天高氣淸」是宋玉九辨中悲秋的話。）你看他說梅，說蓮、說飛鴻，從冬春想到夏秋，無疑的是四季相思了。</p>
<p>最後四句：「海水夢悠悠，君愁我亦愁。南風知我意，吹夢到西洲。」這一個結尾却又敎我躊躇了。如果承着上文來說，那自然還是作那男子的口氣；可是問題就在「南風」二字講不通，古詩及樂府歌辭絕少有對女子稱「君」的例十還在其次。因為男的本在江北，女的本在江南，照理，應該說「北風」才對，如何偏說『南風」呢？說「南風」，則男子當在江南、女子當在江北。這樣，興事實恰恰相反。如果是女子的口氣，自然「君」字的問題解決了，而「南風」的困難還依然存在着。因為這樣的講，女子固在江南，但西洲反而又在江北，而且變成男子的家了，豈不與詩中所述更矛盾了嗎？</p>
<p>究竟該怎麽講才通呢？我想，這一個結尾還是作為女子的口氣更對。只須看「君愁我亦愁」的這個『亦』字，就可知文勢至此已經掉換過口氣了。因為上文一路寫來，無非是男子想念女子的話、他想到那女子在一座高樓上整日的凝神盼望他的情侶，連影子也沒有看見，只見着茫茫大海，一望無際的綠波在天水相連的空中搖動着。寫到這裏，忽然轉過華調，改作女子的口氣道：</p>
<p>「那無邊的海水喲！眞是如同夢般的渺茫。相思而不得相見，你愁苦，我又何嘗不愁苦呢？—不過一提到「夢」，「夢』也是好的。如果南來的風（即向南的風，實即北風）。知道我的心事的話，把你從夢中吹到西洲來，　　們　夢工見見面，豈不聯勝於終日　　別而相思，為相思而愁苦的　？</p>
<p>凡樂府歌辭多用對話禮，能往作雙方問答語氣。這詩雖非直接對話，但結尾四句確因男子想念女子而為女子作一個明折的表示，當然仍有對話的意味。這麼一結，就更顯得不平凡了。陌上桑，羽林　等篇也有同樣的作風，這樣說來什麽問題都解決了。</p>
<p>或者有人疑心「南風』二字恐不能如此講。其貿這又何必懷疑？六朝人擬作的李陵答蘇武書，不明明有「時因北風，復惠德音』的話麽？李陵在匈奴，蘇武在長安，照理應該說「南風」，不說南風而說北風，不也是常作北來或向北的風解麽？</p>
<p>最後，倘若有人問：「篇末四句旣為女子口氣，女子不也可以在江北嗎？」我的答案還是「不可以」。因為這樣，「浙梅寄江北」一句便不好講。詩中說「江北」，顯然是暗示那個男子的所在地了。「江北』與『西洲」對舉，顯然是兩個不同的方向了。</p>

<h3>「甘肅考古」</h3>
<p>— 裴文中博士講　北大史學會記</p>
<p>一·工作是繼續前人的</p>
<p>此次到甘肅作史前考古工作，是奉中央地質調査所命令去的。從本年六月自北平出發，十一月初返回北平，歷時約五個月。此次工作，是繼續二十年前安特生（J.　G.　Andersson）先生的工作。一九二三至二四年時，安先生與袁復禮先生等到甘肅靑海作史前人類調査，足跡所至有三個區域：　湟河（西寗河）流域，　洮河流域及　民勤（鎭番）附近。安先生將這三個區域的史前文化分作六期：齊家期，仰韶期（在洮河流域為半山及馬家窰），馬廠期，辛店期，寺窪期，沙井期。安先生認為前三期是新石器時代末期，後三期已至銅器時代；並估計其時間約自西曆紀元前二千五百年至五百年。安先生更認為這六期是連續的，一系相承的演變下來，因時間不同而分作六个时期。这六期所代表的文化，安先生定名为「仰韶文化」。又因那個時期中所用的陶器，上繪彩色花紋，故又名為「彩陶文化」。安先生的發見及研究結果，引起了全世界的注意。安先生回國至今已二十餘年，他未完的工作，我們一直未能繼續。今年本人和朱泰恒先生同去甘肅，雖無成績可言，但總算我們尚擬繼續前人的工作。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，中央研究院夏鼎先生及北平研究院的黄文弼先生曾在西北作了許多重要的考古工作，但他們報吿尙未發表，我們不能引為參考，很覺遺憾。</p>
<p>二·共走了四個區域</p>
<p>我與朱泰恒先生這次一共走了四個區域：　渭河上游（自天水至隴西）。　西漢水流域（即嘉陵江上游，成縣，禮縣，西和等地）。　洮河流域（洮沙至臨洮）。　大夏河流域（臨夏寗定縣境）。由這四個區域，我們共發見了九十餘個史前八類遺址，其中有十餘個應當繼續作大規模的開掘工作。</p>
<p>（一）渭河上游</p>
<p>渭河下游已有北平研究院徐旭生蘇秉琦諸先生作過考古工作，我們這次調査的是在渭河上游。道個區域的史前文化，可分三期：初期，即安特生先生所謂之「仰韶期」，這是彩陶文化最盛的時期，彩陶之應用甚廣，製作亦精。中期，彩陶已趨衰落，應用較少，製用亦較粗。晚期，彩陶已將絕跡，偶有彩陶，其彩飾亦甚簡單。彩陶文化之所以衰落，我個人以為，是因為直接受了「原始的中國文化」的影響。我所謂之「原始的中國文化」，現尙不知其詳，只知是殷文化以前的文化。</p>
<p>（二）西漢水流域</p>
<p>這一區域大致與渭河上游同，惟稍具地方性質。由這個區域，可以知道彩陶文化向南分佈的情形。</p>
<p>（三）洮河流域</p>
<p>這一區域，由渭源與渭河上游相連接。在這一區域中，彩陶文化的鼎盛時期，即仰韶時期，墓葬有「半山」區域，住地有馬家窰及寺窪山等地。在這許多地方，彩陶製作之精及應用之廣，均與渭河上游相同。</p>
<p>此期以後，在洮河流域，彩陶文化亦漸袞，惟不如渭河上游衰落之速。我的意見是：彩陶文化衰落較慢，係因受原始的中國文化影響較少之故。衰落的第一個時期，即安特生先生所謂之馬廠期，不過馬廠期在大夏河及湟河流域，比洮河流域為更發達。</p>
<p>馬廠期之後為辛店期，在洮河流域特別發達。這時期的人類尙多用彩陶，惟製作粗糙，顯然可見工業中心已轉移到其他（如銅器）方面去了。這一時期的文化亦受原始的中國文化的影響，例如陶器之花紋多有雷紋及　紋者，即是一種明證。（未完）</p>
<h3>與廬冀野先生　論「排當樂次」</h3>
<p>— 閻自鍔</p>
<p>兩種本子間的差別這樣大，盧先生竟不加選擇，即依以著書，贊在是不應當的。</p>
<p>盧先生說「排當樂次」是「數單」的濫觴。這直是視「排當樂次』為一個專名辭，我覺得這尙待斟酌。因為在武林舊事中，常有「排當」這個詞兒；「排當樂次」聯用的僅一見。可見「排當」和「樂次」不是必然要聯緊在一起的固定的專名詞，而是各自獨立的詞兒。如</p>
<p>端午條：「先期學士院供帖子，如春日禁中排當，例用朔日。」</p>
<p>中秋條：「禁中是夕，有賞月延桂排當。」</p>
<p>重九條：「禁中例於八日作重九排當。」</p>
<p>開爐條：「是日御前供進夾　御服……至明年二月朔止，皇后殿開爐排當……」</p>
<p>冬至條：「朝天大朝會慶賀排當。」</p>
<p>以上各條中的「排當」的意思，好像今人所說的「排塲」，即「舖排的塲面」之省稱。所謂「天基聖節排當』即「天基聖節」時的「排塲」之謂。「天基聖節排當」時須作樂，作樂有一定的次序，這便是「樂次」產生的根據了。「排當」和「樂次」分明是指的兩件事，「樂次」且是「排當」中的一項。照文法講，把「排當」和「樂次」聯在一起，最容易發見的錯誤，便是「排當樂次」之前沒有了主詞。因為這個主詞是太重要了：沒有「天基聖節」作主詞，或用其他的主詞，在武林舊事中還未之見。照武林舊事中的通例，「排當」一詞應是綴於「天基聖節」之後的，「樂次」則是附加的另一事的說明，不得和「排當」聯在一起，而成為一專名詞。</p>
<p>「排當樂次」旣不能視為一專名詞，盧先生所說的「戲單」的濫　是根據什麽說的呢？我在上文中已經說過，「樂次」就是作榮的次序。盧先生大概根據此點而言。武林舊事中沒有指明「樂次」的用法。但就今見舊事中的款式言，和今日的「戲單」是不相同的。</p>
<p>宣南零夢錄：</p>
<p>「當時各園戲單，係用長約二寸，高約一寸黄紙印成。此單未送之先，另有園中採得是日戲目，用紅單片開最佳之戲數齣，呈諸官座，各當　挨座傳觀，有願先觀為快者，閱訖，賞以一二十文。」</p>
<p>夢華瑣簿：</p>
<p>「三寸紅箋窄戲單。案今戲園無戲單，諸伶或書片紙　懷袖，備相識者顧問，惟堂會仍用紅紙戲目。』</p>
<p>品花寳鑑第五回：「……見聘才的跟班，走到聘才身邊道：葉先生送過來的戲單。子玉過來，與聘才同看看。見頭幾齣是掃花三醉議劍謁師……」</p>
<p>關於戲單的記載，散見於各家筆記小說者當不止此。但是和盧先生所說的「　單」同一意義的記載則未多見。</p>
<p>幕表」，在文明戲裏的作用，頗像古時穿錢用的繩子。把一劇的主要節目一一寫在表上，劇中人便跟着這張表走。到了表上所列的最後節目演完了時，一劇便算演完了。這是中國話劇運動前期，沒有劇本時，一個過渡時代的產物。就其性質形式和用途說，和「排當樂次」是毫無關係的。　（續完）</p>

<h3>怪說</h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>歷史由來有兩派，一是專重實證，不能作半句誑妄，一是偏於推想，不妨由近及遠，由甲至乙。前者屬於歸納，後者或者勉强算是演繹。古來荒唐話本來很多，穆天子傳山海經離騷天問等都是，其意偏於推想或想象，有眞亦有假，司馬遷頭腦比較科學，覺得黄帝以前，無徵不信，毅然決然剪去若干傳說時代，不能說眼光不遠大。可是太史公不是像西洋科學家那麽呆，大小兩猫須開大小兩門，所以其文字中仍充滿小說傳奇式的描貓寫，不使我們悶損，以此成為千古絕作。</p>
<p>淸朝人受文字獄等威脅，只好鑽故紙，而又絕對不敢發異論，實證的史學，大為流行，雖如此，而自不敢超出故人的圈子有所懷疑，故實是古人之奴隸。直至常州學派以公羊哲學為說，才引出康有為的懷疑派來，奠定近代新史學的基礎，七八大本「古史辨」的文章，其實全是道一派一脈之傳。</p>
<p>懷疑誠然是好，因此才有推究與求證，甲骨與金文的解詁與應用，使古代史完全變了樣子，加以新的社會科學輸入，更使三千年後的人，對三千年前有了進一步的了解，雖是章太炎呂誠之諸老輩不信這許多東西，終於不生效力。</p>
<p>然而毛病也未嘗無有，便是造作諸種無根怪說，隨意亂講，不論事實，不找證據，「唯怪之欲聞」，我覺得這也是不好的，慢慢也許把實證的史學，完全陷入空想的泥淖裏去，那就離學術的求眞精神越來越遠了。</p>
<p>舉例言之，譬如有人以畢翟為印度人，完全從「墨」字發揮之類，殊覺太涉想象，久已為人詬病。不料近讀新中華雜誌，又有主張安祿山為亞歷山大譯音的，其理由無非因安的英文拚音字頭是A，亞歷山大也是，而亞歷山大大帝的武力曾及亞洲，祿山又為胡人云云，如此求證，豈不可笑？而正正經經的學術刋物，亂登此種不成熱的東西，也未免有此减色。</p>
<p>査敦皇發現的天寳十載丁籍，其中多有胡人姓氏，而屬於西域或波斯者甚多，與安祿山音近者有「阿了黑山」「軋瑩山」諸名，故日本史家桑原藏頗疑安氏為波斯人，然猶不敢據斷為亞歷山大，因「阿了黑山」之音，與亞歷山大的排列究是不同。前文作者連這一點也未見，而有如是武斷的更氣，大約亦與說墨翟為紅頭阿三者近似，實在有點不足為訓。我覺得中國人向來的精神是實事求是，而近世則一反其道，几事不從一點一滴作起，專從駭俗立異以博一采着眼，這風氣是很可顧慮的！也許這就是「海派」吧？</p>
<h3>天雨有感</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>記不起在那一本書上某洋人說過道麽幾句話：「天下東西最有用的不一定最値錢，最値錢的不一定最有用，例如金鋼鑽與水，前者並無多少用處，而價奇昻，後者之於人不可或缺，僅次於空氣，而極不値錢。」此話甚確。不但金鋼鑽與水如此，就是人與人亦何嘗不然。世上儘多無一絲一毫用處之人，而衣綾羅綢緞，吃山珍海味，以進口不易的汽車載着他嫖賭吃喝，使馬路受損，甚至撞死了比他有用的猪狗，反之辛勞一生，流血流汗，以益人民的人，倒落得衣不蔽體，食不果腹。</p>
<p>言歸正傳。水之値錢雖不及金鋼鑽的億兆之一，而在不知金鋼鑽為何物的貧苦小民看來，像上海這種有自來水廠的都市，水之為物也幾近乎奢侈品了。敝寓的抽水馬桶壞了多時，修理之費甚鉅，迄今無從抽水，家人只得端水以冲之，但老太太嚴禁耗費淸水，只許使用洗面洗衣洗米洗菜之後的剩餘汚水。有時我或小孩忘了慈訓，開放水龍頭備用，一經給她看見，必厲聲曰：「阿彌陀佛，自來水費上個月用了這許多，還不知道省一點！」不但如此，我們的自來水龍頭鬆了一點，關時須用力旋緊，始不至於滴答滴答的流出，這又使她關心萬分，比我的關心國事尤甚，每當晚上上床之前，必先去用力旋一旋緊，有時半夜三更的忽然起來，問她什麽事情，說是聽見水龍頭滴水之聲，其實那裏有這回事。可見水之於家慈，其價値也非同小可，長此以往，我眞祖心她的神經會出毛病。</p>
<p>這是鄙人一家之事嗎？如果如此，倒也罷了。但事實上上海灘上為自來水費用心的人家，恐怕是比比皆然。因此我常發呆想。夫水，天賜之物也，人生所不可或缺之物也，天賜人需，為什麽要花錢而後始能得之？為術生，為便利，我贊成自來之水？水欲自來，自須設廠購機器裝水管等等，這就是所謂成本與投資，當然非收費不足以維特與盈利。但水本身究竟來自天上，毋需人工，着和馬路比較起來，一不必開拓修築，二不須澆以柏油舖以木塊，當然省錢省事得多，而人之需人，却比人之需走柏油馬路重要萬萬分，然則何以世界各國都市政府都知道撥款造路修路，並不定價，人民走一里路付費幾元幾角，而不肯設立自來水廠，要人民用水付錢，且付的相當之多？</p>
<p>因之我嘗慨　世界之文明進步，各國政府之為人民謀幸福云云，都是一派空言，不足為舊。世界究竟文明不文明，各國政府究竟為人民謀不謀福利，我欲憑人類喝用上天落下來的水要否付錢而定之。爾果的長篇小說「悲慘世界」中有句云：「上帝賜人以光明，而法律把它來賣錢。」藍當時的法國，限定一家人家只能開幾扇窗戶，逾限須納費若干。現在離悲慘世界之出版已八十五年矣，而上蒼所賜人之水，世界各國政府却仍讓巨商富賈們把它來賣錢獲利，可見世界之仍為</p>
<p>今日天降大雨，我深夜不寐，聽窗外雨聲，想馬路上積水成渠，黄浦江水漲幾吋，再想到家慈之或又因睡夢巾担心自來水費，驚醒過來，不怕傷風，起見看看自來水龍頭是否關緊，深覺世事之離奇矛盾，實屬不可思議。</p>
<h3>風趣</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>宋史米元章知無為軍，州治有巨石，狀奇醜，元章見而大喜，曰：「此足以當吾拜。」具衣冠拜之，呼之為兄。其風趣如此。近見柳南隨筆載稱：「吳歷，字漁山，常熟人，所居有言之墨井，遂自號墨井道人，工詩善晝，兼精書法，得東坡筆意。嘗遊吳興，謁其郡守，謁入未即見，信步至一僧舍，見東坡醉翁事眞跡，喜甚即僦居焉，就其處布席展卷，臨摹三四日無倦色。太守遣人遍墨井道人無有也，逆旅之人亦不知其所往。摹竟，欣欣如有得，不果見太守去矣。其高致如此。」此與蔡尙書入鴻覩觀碣，十日不返，有同樣風趣，因類錄之。</p>
<h3>論人情世故</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>祗要是人，總有各人的社會生活經騐，這種生活的經騐一旦定型化了，就成所謂人情世故。因此祇要是人，總多少懂得一些人情世故。</p>
<p>人生經騐是寳貴的生活敎訓，人情世故旣是這稱敎訓的積聚，自然是値得珍視的。不過凡是從進步中得來的東西，到了不再能加以進步運用的時候，反會變成一塊絆脚石。人情世故便是如此。</p>
<p>大家認識現在的社會風氣是太壞了，貪汚，投機，欺騙以及諸如此類顯示社會道德墮落的新阻幾無日不塞滿了報紙篇幅。法律旣不能防患於事前，刑罰亦祗能儆戒於事後。記得勝利前不久某報曾發表過一篇題名不要讓人心開了閘的文章，當時已暗不了這種嚴重的社會問題可能到來。而現在決不止是開了閘，大有已決了堤之勢。</p>
<p>問題的個別原因自然異常複雜，譬如從貪汚問題，有許多人認為是公務員的待遇不够養廉所致。道也誠然。但更有一個重耍原因，那就是滿腹世故所造成的心理。許多人都以為在這個時代做事情不撈「外快」，便是天字第一號的獃子。你不撈，便有別人撈，時勢旣是如此，我又何必一個人做呆子！</p>
<p>朋友們見面，談起彼此的生活情形，總得問起你除了正規的收入之外，有沒有其他的「進賬」。被問者雖不一定會得正面答覆，但在彼此的一笑中也就瞭解了。你弄錢的方法愈多，別人決不會輕視你，而倒反階暗佩服你的「本領」。看見某人近來西裝簇新，皮鞋學亮，雖明知其人的正常進益不能如此，但總會恭維一聲「老兄眞有辦法」。而且這種恭維十有九分不是虛偽客氣，確是發乎心底的敬慕。被恭維者也意滿自得，認為常然。這是因為彼此間都懂得這一套人情世故</p>
<p>許多太來是罪惡的事，祇要通過人情世故的註解，便會大家視若常然。譬如「楷油」本是不正當的行為，但現在早已被犬家認為是當然的風氣，不揩油倒變做是反常了！娘姨置小菜要揩油，主婦認為是當然，縱使有個把「廉潔」娘姨，在主人眼中她仍不免是屬於揩油的一類。因為主人都有這樣的心理，做娘姨的不靠外快靠甚麼？</p>
<p>再進一步講，賄賂貪汚的心理動機又何嘗不如此！在行賄者與受賄者間都有這樣一種心理默契。在行賄者的心理是：「他是幹這種差使的人，我不在他身上攪落幾個小銅　，我就會受他的麻煩，算了，這幾個錢總是省不了的。」而受賄者的心理是：「我是幹甚麼的？我不拿他的錢，自有別人會去拿，他旣識相，我也樂得，何况皇帝不差使餓兵，我能憑這幾文死薪水過日嗎？與人方便，自己方便，某人某人都在這樣的幹我又何苦不識相！」</p>
<p>「識相」便是深通人情世故的一個要訣，所謂做人要懂得噱頭，便不會吃虧。否則就不免要被人駡做「壽頭」。</p>
<p>這是多麼可怕的人情世故啊！但却正是今日都市社會的普遍風氣，是社會的普遍心理。你不懂得這此，你就必然是這個社會的失敗者。</p>
<p>我不是衛道者，但却害怕我們這個通人情世故的民族將會因此墮入不可挽救的深淵—經騐是我們需要的，但今天更需要的是新的生命，新的血液。被指爲　大和呆虫的人啊，你是有福了，阿們！</p>
<h3>五月五日生</h3>
<p>— 橄旌</p>
<p>甫史王鎭惡傳略云：「鎭惡，王猛孫也，五月五日生，猛奇之，日：昔孟嘗君生惡日而相齊，是兒亦興我門乎！遂名鎭惡」云云，可見五月五日生，為時俗所忌。然除盂嘗君，王鎭惡外，據冷廬雜識引載：尙有胡廣（漢朝的胡廣，不是宋朝的胡廣），張飛，王鳳，齊後主，齊南陽王綽，崔信明，宋徵宗，翁應龍，紀過，遼懿德皇后，趙元昊等，其遭遇皆不同。是奇者，田特秀以五月五日生，小字五兒，所居里名「半十」，行第五，二十五歲，鄉府省御四試，皆第五，年五十五，八月十五日卒。（見金史）</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第四章　兩心相印</p>
<p>渚齋連稱謝謝，把牠接過，陡覺一股芬香，撲到鼻裏、隨乎摺好，放在衣袋內，扶着　紈，走下平合。兩人踏着月光，走出園外，渚齋想要僱車，綺紈道：「不必，今天月光很好，夜裏又沒人，我們隨便走走。」隨伸手搭在渚齊臂上，二人款步，慢慢走着，沿途上幸沒遇見熟人。一路上綺紈不斷査問渚齋父母脾氣如何，生活情形如何，在銀行服務已有幾年，外面有什麽好朋友，談談說說，不期步出宣武門，到逹校塲胡同，離綺紈家已是不遠，倏的由胡同　進一輛黑色汽車，綺紈眼快，急把渚齋拉在路旁，讓那汽車駛過。綺紈隨向渚齋握一握手道：「快到家了，你不必送，明天見。」說後，匆匆往前走去。渚齋一路上和綺紈款語，正在熱情激盪中，給綺紈如此一來，突行怔住。眼看綺紈忙忙往前走，心裏茫然！痴痴站樹旁槐樹下，見駛過那輛黑色汽車，巳停在綺紈那兩扇綠油油門口，車後紅燈一閃，把汽車倒開了十幾步，車身一翻，轉過車頭，車前兩盞車燈，射出數丈光芒，恰射在老槐樹下。渚齋眼前給他光芒一晃，才回過神來，覺站在此處太無謂，微微嘆一口氣，踱着懶步，低着頭，慢慢走了，心裏只是懊惱感觸。到胡同口，正要僱車，倐的汽笛鳴了一聲，那輛黑色汽車由身旁掠過，所差只有數寸，渚齋險給汽車撞倒，嚇一大跳，急行躲開，在這一瞥眼間，陡見綺紈似和一個男人在車內，不由神經又是一震！在此驚嚇之下，心上不期又恨又妬，想綺紈是一個天眞女兒，如何會和這些人接近！她家敎很嚴，何以她家裏人由她幹去！立時由妬恨的心，又生出疑惑，想要探聽探聽，解決這疑問。如此一想，立時變更主意，不想回去，暗忖她家裏那個小王媽，看似很多話的，向她打聽打聽，也許能得眞相，於是重走入胡同內，到綺紈門前，蹲下去，在地上抓些浮土，向身上衣袖和褲管一酒，隨即連連按幾下電鈴。小王媽開了半扇門出來一看，見是渚齋，忙笑道：「徐先生來了，老板不在家。」渚齋裝着很狼狽神氣道：「我眞倒霉！給汽車碰了，幾乎沒壓死！」小王媽一聽，立把兩扇門敞開，門內電燈，射在渚齊身上，果見他滿身塵土，似跌在街上，剛爬起來，驚問道：「汽車碰了，受傷嗎？快請進來。」說時，把身子一讓，站在門旁，讓渚齋一拐一拐，走了進去。（本章完）。</p>
<h3>投稿者言</h3>
<p>— 羅塔</p>
<p>「人生如蜉蝣」未免言之太過，「文章如蜉蝣」才是鐵錚錚的事實。蜉蝣朝生幕死，報上文章從出捲筒機到包油條的一段時間總共不過五六小時，早報不知有支，晚報不及過晨，一晝夜之間有多少「心靈」的成費！一晚路過八仙橋菜市，看見一卡車一卡車從屠塲運到的血淋淋的牛羊，不禁對自己和別人的心血結晶起了同樣的惻隱之心。</p>
<p>如果說賣笑是最下賤的職業，那麼賣文該是最愚笨的職業。一個知識份子，各種各式賺錢方法都想盡了。才出此下策。就說拉黄包車吧，乘客也還是先講好了價錢才敢坐上，你呢？到目的地後隨人家給多少。去年給一家報紙寫文章，上半月三千字計得三萬元，下半月六千字心裏想這回六萬元可以拿穩，不料報館虧本，祗領到一萬五千元。記得從前在小學的算學班裏老是不懂什麽呌做「反比例」，一天先生問我一件事一人兩日可做完，二人呢？我答：「四日」，全班大笑。現在總算「體騐」了一次，備了。這也許更可笑，但我祗好把眼淚往肚裏吞。</p>
<h3>鴨子</h3>
<p>— 許桐華</p>
<p>今天筆者從公事房回來，天色已經垂暮了。王媽搬了一碗煮得爛熟一的鴨子，端端正正的放在桌子中央。依照妻的說法，冬季正是進補的季節，不禁使我想起了關於鴨子的一件舊事。</p>
<p>那一年暮秋時份，妻從故鄉S市出來，帶了一頭肥大的鴨子，說是她的一位鄉親，特地送給我的。這鴨已經養了五六年，據世俗的解釋，它的滋補性特高，因此，妻高高興興的帶了出來，預備等天氣轉凉的時候，整隻鴨子讓我分二天吃完。妻堅持不肯讓別人分嘗一　，否則滋補性即見遜色。其間多少是含有一些迷信成分的。</p>
<p>接着幾天，天氣熟度依舊不减。這鴨就養養在庭前的天井內，我會經走到樓下，看過它幾次。在回憶中，它是一頭可憐的小動物。撲着翅膀，搖搖擺擺的走着，鼓着圓圓的眼睛，不是嘎嘎的呌着，說不上它究竟是悲哀還是快樂的表示。不過它也許犯了所謂「水土不服」的毛病，它的體軀，却日益消瘦了。</p>
<p>之後，某一天稍有寒意，妻看着鴨子體重减輕，覺得不能再等待了。當天晚上，我回家的時候，桌子上正如本文第一節所述，同樣放了一滿碗的鴨十，不過裏面加了茴香等作料，煮得更講究。</p>
<p>我在吃鴨子的時候，妻笑着對我說，今天發生了一件很意外的事。我問她是什麼事，她說要等我完了才肯吿訴我。這樣，我就把這一大碗鴨吃完了。然鍋子中還有兩大碗，預備在明天分兩次給我吃。</p>
<p>飯後，妻就將那一件事吿訴我。</p>
<p>那時我家中還沒有雇王媽。以前的女傭是不會殺鴨子的妻特地邀了隔壁米店中的夥計來，問他會不會殺鴨子。他說：「會的，會的。」一面他拎了鴨子出去，迎頭一刀，丟在地上，自顧自的走了。</p>
<p>女傭將殺死的鴨子，放在開桶中，用熱中灌下，那裏知道它的喉管沒有割斷，給熟水一冲，活了過來，歪着腦袋，從後門闡了出去，直闖到隔壁米店內。</p>
<p>米店夥計看了它一呆，彷彿這鴨向它「討命」似的。他連聲說：並不是我吃的，與我並不相干。」一霎眼間，這鴨鑚進了米店的地坑，好容易才把它捉了出來。</p>
<p>這一會女傭就把鴨活活的放在桶內，用熱水澆死。拔鴨毛時，有許多細毛，她差不多費了一小時才拔完。妻恐怕我聽了這事，食不下咽，所以一直等到我吃完一大碗後，才吿訴我。</p>
<p>第二天，我因事到同孚路舍親某長輩的寓所去。臨走之前，妻再三叮囑我回來，可將鴨子的殘羹呷完。那一天凑巧主人宴客，加上我好久沒有訪候，所以他們一定把我留下吃晚飯。我還很分明的記得問桌有一位前某銀行總經理現任證交交易勿所經紀人的C先生，還有一位從內地來的實業家K先生。</p>
<p>最初，我打定主意，每一道菜，略嘗滋味，即行停箸，好等着回家後吃鴨子。可是主人是那樣的股勤，見我淺　即止，就把菜接連堆在我面前的小碟子內。那天的菜不但烹調得好，而且很豐盛，我的防禦錢，終於完全瓦解了。旣喝了五六杯酒，又淺淺的吃了兩碗飯，等我站起來的時候，頓時有一種過度的酒醉飯飽的感覺。當天回去的時候，已經九時了。妻厮守着那碗鴨子在等我。我帶着幾分歉意，拒絕她的好意，實在再沒有容納的餘地了。祗好隔一天再吃。</p>
<p>可是，下一天天氣突然熱了起來，等到中午時份，這鴨已經發餿了。撲鼻一股變質的酸味，只好倒在門外的垃圾箱內。</p>
<p>我看妻拿着空碗進來，忽然有一種異樣的感觸：這鴨好不容易的養了五六年，路遠迢迢的帶到上海來，殺鴨時又費了那麽多的手脚，妻怎樣希望能够讓我一個人吃完，然而終於仍舊將殘肴倒去！我的心中掠過一陣惆悵。這兩天我正在第二次翻讀海明威的小說集，字裏行問充滿一股淡漠的悲哀。我想起舊事，彷彿成為這位異國小說家筆下的一個角色了。</p>

<h3>U.S. and Canada Military Aid to China: Negotiations Approaching a Decision Stage; Secretary Marshall Returns Home to Focus on Long-Term Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Reliable sources report: Negotiations between the U.S. and Canada regarding military aid to China, which have been underway in Washington and Nanjing, are now approaching a decision stage. Both sides are currently engaging in frequent contacts on this matter, but the details remain highly confidential. Ambassador Stuart originally planned to fly to Beiping for a two-week vacation before Christmas, but has now decided to reduce it to one week. He will fly to Beiping on the 23rd, stay at Yenching University for seven days, and then return to Nanjing. It is generally speculated that this may be related to the ongoing negotiations between China and the U.S. on various aid programs to China. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Wang met with Canadian Ambassador Davis on the afternoon of the 18th for a lengthy and confidential discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Senate Appropriations Committee last night at 11 p.m. approved an emergency foreign aid appropriation of $570 million, $61 million more than the House-approved amount. Of this, $550 million is earmarked for aid to France, Italy, and Austria, while $20 million is designated for aid to China. The bill has now been submitted to the Senate for discussion. Congress is scheduled to adjourn tonight, and the Senate will convene an hour earlier to ensure a decision can be reached before the recess. Regarding aid to China, neither the House resolution nor the original government proposal stipulated immediate allocation of funds. However, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges stated that the committee's decision was made in recognition of the importance of ensuring the continued functioning of the Chinese government. Congress may increase the appropriation amount after the State Department formally submits an aid to China bill next spring.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th, United Press] According to government officials, one of Secretary Marshall's priorities upon his return from London to the U.S. on the 19th will be a long-term aid to China plan. All indications suggest that the State Department's final proposal will far exceed the $300 million that Marshall estimated in Congress last month. Public interest in aid to China plans is growing in the United States, and Congress is pressing for action, forcing senior government officials to engage in serious discussions on the matter.</p>
<h3>Truman Promises to Urge Congress to Revive China Plan; Welcomes Stalin to Visit the U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman on the 19th called for aid to revitalize the Far East, with particular emphasis on China. He also announced a $17 billion fund for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. Truman promised that he would present a plan to revive China when Congress convenes in early January. Truman stated, "At present, our full attention is focused on Western Europe, as it is the most important region in the world in terms of peace and the future. However, we are also deeply concerned about war-torn Asia. The United States has provided substantial assistance to Japan and Korea to maintain livelihoods and commercial construction. After the war ended, we provided various important forms of assistance to China, with considerable success. The United States should continue to do its utmost to assist in the restoration of economic balance as a foundation for revitalization in the Far East. In recent months, we have been conducting a thorough study of how to meet the special needs of post-war relief in China. I hope to make recommendations to Congress on this matter during the next session."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] President Truman stated today that he would welcome a meeting with Stalin if the latter were willing to come to Washington. He also said that he and Stalin had not exchanged messages recently. He expressed his strong belief that world peace would ultimately be achieved. He declined to comment on the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, stating that Secretary Marshall would explain the matter to the American people tomorrow evening.</p>
<h3>Bishop Corson Declares in Philadelphia: U.S. Future Lies in the Far East; Aid China Association Raises Funds Through Christmas Card Sales to Aid Our Country</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 19th Broadcast: Washington report, Massachusetts State Senator Clarkson today urged immediate authorization of $60 million in temporary aid to China to alleviate the country's current severe difficulties, and proposed a plan to make the most effective use of these funds. He proposed allocating $30 million to purchase food, $4 million to purchase medical supplies, $15 million to purchase clothing, $5 million to purchase fertilizer, $500,000 to purchase seeds, $2 million to purchase miscellaneous items, and $3.5 million for transportation costs. Mr. Clarkson, a former sergeant during the war and now a businessman, has always been interested in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 19th] Methodist Bishop Corson, who recently returned from the Far East, stated yesterday that the Far East would not turn red unless the United States gave up. Aid to China is essential. Before China is unified, the value of relief work is difficult to estimate. The National Government is currently engaged in a war of defense, and the next twelve months will be a critical period in Chinese history. The economic future of the United States is tied to the Far East, and the Far East will provide the best missionary opportunities in a century. The people are ready to accept a new philosophy of life, and if Christian ideas are not adopted, it will greatly affect the future of the entire world.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 18th] The United China Relief Association is continuing its practice of the past several years by selling Christmas cards, with all proceeds going to relief and service programs for China. Last year, the United China Relief Association sold approximately 420,000 Christmas cards, raising $35,000. This year's Christmas card designs are very appealing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] House Democratic Floor Leader McCormack declared in the House of Representatives on the 18th: "The United States should provide military aid to China immediately."</p>
<p>He stated that while economic aid is important to the Chinese government's fight against the communists, military supplies are even more urgent. We have many surplus military materials in the Far East that could be used to help China resist aggression.</p>
<p>He continued: "We should not forget China's contribution in trapping Japan in a two-front war." He acknowledged that the Chinese government is "not perfect," but argued that criticisms were exaggerated. Even if there is corruption within the Chinese government, it is still a free government, at least in areas not occupied by the communists.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Not Ignoring Ambassador's Suggestions on Aid to China; U.S. Embassy Releases Ambassador's Remarks</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Nanjing, 19th] The U.S. Embassy in China announced this morning that recent testimony before a U.S. Congressional committee claimed that the U.S. Ambassador's cables to the State Department often went unanswered. Ambassador Stuart issued the following comment in response:</p>
<p>"In the course of performing my normal duties, I report to the State Department on the situation in China as I see it, and I provide suggestions from time to time. These obviously include the issue of aid to China. However, such communications are classified and I am not free to disclose their contents. I have never felt that the State Department has shown any neglect or discourtesy in answering my inquiries or criticizing my suggestions."</p>
<h3>Kwok Tak-wah Meets with T.V. Soong, Reports on Kowloon Walled City Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 19th] Kwok Tak-wah, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong on the 19th to meet with T.V. Soong, and reported on the Kowloon Walled City matter. It is reported that Soong gave important instructions on the matter. According to Kwok, our government is determined to resolve the Kowloon Walled City issue through diplomatic channels and will not relinquish our sovereignty in the slightest.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Chinese government hopes that the Hong Kong authorities will postpone the order to evacuate residents from the Kowloon Walled City area until an agreement is reached between the Chinese and British governments, and hopes that the Hong Kong authorities will not allow minor issues to affect Sino-British relations.</p>
<h3>Provincial Reorganization Plan: Fu Chiao-chin to Complete Draft Soon; Will Provide to Government for Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Fu Chiao-chin, Director of the Territorial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior, has completed a draft of the "Plan for Reorganizing China's Provincial Boundaries" based on years of research, which will be provided to the government for reference.</p>
<h3>Wei Tao-ming Speaks Out, Denounces Foreign Slander of Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Taiwan Chairman Wei Tao-ming met with reporters on the evening of the 19th and stated that the general situation in Taiwan is currently very stable, with good social order. His trip to Nanjing was to report to the Central Government on the progress and difficulties encountered in governing Taiwan for the past six months. Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the reconstruction of Taiwan and is particularly interested in restoring factories and production capacity. When reporters asked Chairman Wei about his remarks at the Taiwan Assembly regarding foreign conspiracies, he said: You can draw conclusions from the foreign newspapers and magazines that slander Taiwan. Since the recovery of Taiwan, all foreign or foreign-run newspapers and magazines have offered commentary on Taiwan's administration that is not well-intentioned and friendly criticism, but rather rumors and slanders, all aimed at reaching a similar conclusion. If you want to know the details of their vilification, you can consult old newspapers. Facts have proven that the accusations they make against Taiwan Province are entirely fabricated.</p>
<h3>President's Christmas Message to Be Broadcast Abroad Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] According to our city's Gospel Radio Station: President Chiang is scheduled to broadcast a Christmas message abroad on Sunday, the 21st of this month. The President's broadcast will be recorded on film and taken to Shanghai by Tung Hsien-kuang, Director of the Government Information Office of the Executive Yuan, on that day. He will broadcast to foreign countries from the Gospel Radio Station on Tiger Hill Road. Tung will also personally translate President Chiang's broadcast into English at the radio station. The station's wavelength is 1120 kilocycles.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Declares Non-Abandonment of Veto Power at Japan Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters on the 19th in a firm tone that China will absolutely not give up its veto power at the Japan Peace Conference. There have been no new developments in the negotiations on this matter in recent days. The U.S. response and the Soviet response to our second note have not yet been received. The Ministry is still considering how to respond to the British rejection of our proposal with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Councilors Cheng Kuei-yi, Chang Chien-hua, Fan Yu-sui, Chiang Yung, Lu Chien, and Wu Chao-hsu submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the 19th requesting the government to firmly retain the veto power at the Japan Peace Conference. They believe that the veto power is related to our country's active role in the peace talks with Japan and is the key to peace in the Far East. They reiterated the reasons for retaining the veto power and requested the government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to insist on it. The proposal was passed and sent to the government for attention.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented two written reports to the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the 19th: The British response to the peace treaty with Japan has been received by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and we are currently studying the matter. New countries joining the Far East Economic Commission include Vietnam and Burma.</p>

In the past two years, more than 500 kilometers of steel rails have been transported from abroad. If they were not used for repairs, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway could have been built. 1.8 million sleepers have been used for repairs. If they were used for new construction, all 1,500 kilometers of sleepers on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway could have been replaced. The destruction of telegraph lines is even more numerous.

The group, convened by Kan Nai-kuang, believed that the financial part of the plan was already being implemented step by step since the establishment of the Gold Management Bureau. The material part, such as inspecting warehouses, prohibiting remittances of more than 1 million to Shanghai, and prohibiting carrying gold notes in the market, was already detailed in the Regulations on Management of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Mining During Extraordinary Times and the Measures for Prohibiting Speculation During Extraordinary Times. It was decided that there was no need to formulate a separate plan and it was submitted to the Chairman for approval.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] There is no hope of opening up loans from national banks and bureaus in the next two months.

According to a person in charge of the Joint Treasury on the 19th, the board of directors of the Joint Treasury reviewed the results on the 18th and believed that tightening loans could stabilize the market. Although it is not a fundamental solution, it can temporarily curb rising prices. Therefore, loans from national banks and bureaus will continue to be suspended for the time being. The date of resuming lending will be determined after instructions from Chairman Chiang.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-implementation of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Policy</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices and suppress speculation, the Executive Yuan, in addition to establishing the Financial Management Bureau to stabilize finance, also recognizes that the management of cotton yarn and cloth is closely related to prices. To strictly implement the management policy, it has adopted the plan of the National Economic Commission, reorganized the Ministry of Economic Affairs' original Spinning and Adjustment Committee into the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, and implemented the policy of commissioned spinning and weaving, unified purchase, and unified sale, in order to strengthen production, regulate supply, and benefit the people's livelihood. On the 5th of this month, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting approved the organizational regulations of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee and set the date of establishment as New Year's Day, with Yuan Liang taking the position of Chairman. Other personnel appointments will also be announced within the week. According to the Director of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, Director Dong, in a statement on the 17th, after the establishment of the new cotton yarn and cloth management agency, yarn factories and weaving factories will produce for the government, and the government will allocate cotton, and they will spin and weave for the government. The government will carry out unified purchase and unified sale. This is a general outline of the government's restoration of wartime management policies. However, the reaction of general private yarn factories is different. Whether this major measure can be smoothly implemented and achieve the expected results depends on the efforts of the new agency in the future.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Spinning Management Committee was originally a government agency for managing the textile industry, controlling yarn and cloth prices by means of price limits. This June, it was reorganized into the Textile Business Adjustment Committee, changing from rigid control to moderate adjustment. The method of stabilizing yarn prices changed from price limits to negotiated prices. Under the previous control policy, the increase in production was limited, and there was panic regarding raw materials from time to time. The black market for cotton yarn and cloth and the price limits became increasingly disparate, leading to the black market overwhelming the official price, and the spinning management policy was declared a failure. Later, the abandonment of control for adjustment, besides seeing institutional adjustments and personnel changes, did not have any significant achievements. On November 23rd, the National Economic Commission passed the "Outline for Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn with Certificates," preparing to control yarn and cloth materials and continue to purchase cotton yarn, to implement commissioned spinning and weaving, and then negotiate prices and set up adjustment public warehouses to stabilize the national yarn and cloth market. After this method was announced, on the one hand, it aroused the opposition of the private textile industry, and on the other hand, it was supported by the copying industry. Soon there was talk of reorganizing the Spinning and Adjustment Committee again. Recently, following the wave of rising prices, the government decided to expand the distribution of daily necessities and decided to adopt wartime methods to strengthen the control of cotton yarn and cloth, entrusting the important responsibility of controlling national cotton yarn and cloth to the soon-to-be-established Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee. Obviously, this adjustment is not simply a change of institutions and personnel, but a further and comprehensive development of the control policy, which is of greater significance.</p>
<p>According to the organizational regulations of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, its business scope is very broad, including the overall purchase, transportation, and distribution of national cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, the adjustment of market supply and demand, and the approval of prices, the increase and improvement of raw materials and finished products, the import of raw materials and the export of finished products, and even the zonal establishment of state-owned and private textile factories and the coordination of raw material producing areas, are all its main responsibilities. As for the control policy, according to the government's planned program, all yarn factories will spin and weave for the government, and the government guarantees that in addition to paying for labor and expenses, they will obtain reasonable profits. The goal of its implementation of management is not to establish a profit-making business organization, but to protect the interests of the public and prevent speculation. Theoretically speaking, cotton yarn and cloth belong to people's daily necessities, cotton yarn and cloth production should be for the people, and cotton yarn and cloth economy should be a people's livelihood economy, closely related to every people's living standards and production requirements. At this time of severe national economic crisis, the implementation of strict control, the prevention of black market speculation, and the crackdown on material hoarding should be very necessary measures. The problem lies in the efficiency of the administration, the steps of control, and the cooperative attitude of the private yarn factories; as for the supply of raw materials and quality technology, they are relatively easier to overcome.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of raw cotton production, our country's output last year was 7.43 million dan, this year it has increased by 50%, and it may increase again next year. Coupled with the import of American cotton, there is no shortage of raw material sources. Our country's textile industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, of which 3.6 million spindles are currently in operation. Based on spindles, the annual demand for raw cotton is 10.8 million dan. In addition, the hand-weaving industry still needs 2.5 million dan, totaling 13 million dan. In the future, the Management Committee will uniformly purchase raw cotton and distribute it, which should not be a problem in theory. Regarding commissioned spinning and weaving, the production activities of textile factories are guaranteed, as long as the controlling authorities have overall planning, fair supply of raw materials, fair commissioned spinning fees, and the problem of power is solved, and the factory is guaranteed not to stop work, then private yarn factories should support it. The main purpose of controlling yarn and cloth production today should be to facilitate distribution, followed by the export of finished products. If the main purpose of controlling yarn and cloth production is to export to foreign markets, rather than supply domestic distribution, not considering the root cause and focusing on the tip, it will depart from the "economic adjustment" and return to the path of "political control." This seems very unfavorable to the future of cotton yarn and cloth control.</p>
<p>In short, comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth is imperative. In order to stabilize prices, prevent speculation, and stabilize people's livelihood, implementing distribution is a necessary measure at present. We hope that the establishment of the new agency will take on this major responsibility with a new spirit of service and mobile management technology, dispelling public doubts with its performance in work. The failure of cotton yarn and cloth management during the war was not due to errors in the control policy, but to the low efficiency of the administration. The failures of the Spinning Management Committee and the Spinning Adjustment Committee after the war were not due to errors in price limits or adjustments, but because the wind of speculation and illegal manipulation undermined the government's decisions. Now that a new control agency has been established, it is endowed with authority, and given the magnitude of its responsibilities, it should not suffer another setback. We sincerely hope that the authorities can learn from the past lessons and be vigilant. On the one hand, they can stand on the position of the nation and the country, and on the other hand, they can protect the rights and interests of private enterprises, considering both the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth control policy can achieve the expected results.</p>

<h3>Independence of UNRRA Air Transport Cannot Happen, Likely to Improve the Post-War Committee</h3>
<p>[Our News] The UNRRA Air Transport, headed by Flying Tiger General Chennault, should end at the end of this year in accordance with the original agreement signed with UNRRA. However, the Air Transport authorities have been in contact with all parties, hoping to continue operations, and are currently in discussions with the Executive Yuan authorities, possibly establishing an Air Transport under the name of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Committee. General Chen may sign an agreement with the committee on a monthly basis. It is learned that our Ministry of Communications cannot approve foreigners operating airlines independently, so the independent establishment of the Air Transport is impossible. The Ministry of Communications had intended to purchase all the equipment of the team, but it was not agreed to by the Air Transport. Chen had also discussed cooperation with the Southwest Airlines, jointly operated by the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments, but the negotiations were unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>譚伯羽報告　交通進步困難</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) In his report, Mr. Tan Boyu used facts to illustrate the difficulties in current transportation progress. He first stated: In the past six months, since the mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, the departments under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications have been facing destruction on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Regarding railways: of the more than 30,000 kilometers of railways nationwide, more than 15,000 kilometers were passable in January of this year. Currently, they continue to be damaged, and only more than 13,000 kilometers are passable. However, the new lines in South China have increased by 400 kilometers. In the Northeast, the Beining Railway was fully opened to traffic in early December, but it has now been cut off again. Of the more than 3,000 kilometers of road, only more than 1,300 kilometers are open for military use. In North China, the Zhengtai Railway from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan has been impassable since October. The Jiaoji Railway was fully repaired last December, but it was destroyed again after only two months. Currently, the section from Jinan to Qingdao has been cut into three sections. The PingSui Railway was open to traffic until November, and there were still direct trains from Ping to Baotou. The PingHan Railway has suffered significant damage in the past one or two months. The southern section is impassable, and Zhengzhou is almost like an isolated island. The northern section has also undergone seven repairs. The portion north of Baoding is expected to be restored around the 25th of this month. The line from the PingHan Railway to Jiaozuo was restored earlier this year, but it was cut off again in April. Efforts are currently being made to restore it in order to utilize the coal from Jiaozuo. In South China, the YueHan Railway was repaired within a limited time frame last July due to military needs, but due to inadequate equipment, there have been issues. The ZheGan Railway from Jinhua to Quzhou was repaired in August of this year. In order to transport grain, it was planned to reach Nanchang directly from Hangzhou by the end of the year, but this was not achieved due to insufficient materials. It is now hoped that the materials will arrive by the end of January, and the goal can be achieved one month later. The Jinpu Railway has now been opened to traffic on the 12th of this month. This opening has great significance. Shanghai originally relied on coal from Kailuan, but it was greatly affected due to transportation inconveniences. Now, it can use coal from Boshan via the Jiaoji Railway. Jinan, which was originally an isolated island, can now communicate with the outside world.</p>
<p>Regarding highways, improvements are not easy due to changes in foreign exchange rates, shortages of gasoline, and fluctuations in prices. Currently, the focus is on driver training and military vehicle registration. Old roads are difficult to repair satisfactorily, while the new roads only include the Jixin Highway, which is 1,247 kilometers long, with an altitude of more than 3,000 meters. It was built by the Qinghai Provincial Government through requisitioning labor from the people. The process was like a Journey to the West. The road runs from Xining through Daotang River, Mangya to the Jinhong Mountain of the Southern Xinjiang Highway.</p>
<p>Regarding waterways, there are currently more than 951,000 tons of ships, with Shanghai accounting for the majority. Regarding shipping, military transport accounts for 5% of private companies, while military transport accounts for the majority of state-owned companies. Regarding overseas routes, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was able to sail to the Philippines in July of this year, setting a precedent for flying the Chinese flag on the high seas. Regarding ports, Tanggu New Port and Huludao, etc., are all being completed with great effort.</p>
<p>Regarding aviation, China and Central Airlines have a total of 83 aircraft, of which 63 are flyable. In January of this year, more than 30 aircraft achieved a record of flying more than 40,000 kilometers. This month, 38 aircraft flew 78,000 kilometers. International routes, such as Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, Sino-Dutch, and Sino- , have all been signed, but Siam has not yet been implemented. Currently, China Airlines officially took off on November 16 to Honolulu and San Francisco to participate in international flights. It is not yet possible for Central Airlines. The Ministry of Communications established the Civil Aviation Administration on January 20 of this year, and civil aviation management is now under the control of the Civil Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Regarding telegraphs, there have been more than 4,000 instances of damage, with a loss of 1,470 tons of copper wire and more than 200 tons of wire being stolen. The personnel in charge of the repair project have stated that they have conducted eight major repairs from Beiping to Baoding, and the wire used can build more than 5,000 kilometers of telegraph lines. Since July of this year, we have been able to conduct direct telephone calls with the United States. The postal service is improving daily.</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統咨文國會　提長期援歐程序　需一百七十億美元協助十六國復興　俾對世界和平有所貢獻</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman formally requested Congress on the 19th to pass a bill allocating $17 billion to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe, maintain freedom, and prevent another war. The President submitted a 9,000-word message to Congress, urging it to use American money and productivity to fund the Marshall Plan so that it can be sustained until 1952. Truman said that the adoption of the Marshall Plan would be "evidence of the united freedom-loving people resisting totalitarian pressure, defending the foundations of freedom, and raising the living standards of all mankind." President Truman asked Congress to allocate funds to assist the 16 European countries in their efforts to help each other recover. He estimated that at least $6.8 billion would be needed in the 15 months after the start of the European aid program, which runs from April of this year to the end of June of the following year. Truman pointed out that this amount accounts for 5% of the cost of the United States in World War II. He said that during the effective period of the Marshall Plan, 3% of the United States' national income would exceed this amount. The President said: "The basic goal of the United States' continued assistance to European countries is to help these countries achieve economic self-sufficiency and contribute to world peace and prosperity with all their strength." Truman said that the European Recovery Program is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter. "Free nations are working together to promote world peace. Any country that attempts to obstruct or undermine Europe for its own self-interest is clearly contrary to this goal." Truman pointed out: "Several governments in Eastern Europe were invited to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss economic cooperation, but they refused to participate. Their non-participation makes the recovery effort more difficult. On the other hand, it will undoubtedly prolong their own economic difficulties. This is not enough to prevent the restoration of trade between Eastern and Western Europe, as it is beneficial to both sides." The special Congress will adjourn on the evening of the 19th and reopen on January 6 of next year. This meeting is to pass the emergency European aid bill. Truman's message came one day after the end of the special Congress , and Congress will thoroughly study Truman's request on January 6. At the same time, even during the New Year's holiday, any committee of the two houses can start research at any time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] In his speech today calling for the passage of the Marshall European Recovery Program, Truman said: "The Far East's exports to the United States help to pay for Europe's exports to the Far Eastern countries, so Europe is an important link in the world trade network."</p>
<h3>推行計劃六要點　預定四年歐洲各國自給自足增加生產促進普遍繁榮</h3>
<p>President Truman said that there are six basic points for implementing this plan: "This plan is to promote universal recovery within a specified period. "This plan is to use the money and goods we supply in the most effective way to revive Europe. "This plan aims to "reduce the financial cost of the United States on the one hand, and avoid burdening European countries with financial burdens that they cannot sustain for a long time on the other. "This plan was drafted with attention to preserving American resources while reducing the unfortunate consequences of aid to Europe on our country's economy. "This plan seeks to be consistent with other international relations and responsibilities of the United States. "The implementation of this plan is intended to be wise and effective."</p>
<p>President Truman emphasized the importance of "making Europe self-sufficient." He said that the key issue is "increasing Europe's production. The 16 countries have put forward a recovery plan in their report, which estimates that in four years, Europe can be self-sufficient and maintain a reasonable minimum standard of living without external assistance. This plan is based on the following four basic points: The participating countries make strong production efforts. Each country promotes domestic financial stability. Participating countries continue to cooperate with each other to the greatest extent. The solution to the trade deficit between the participating countries and North and South America, with special emphasis on increasing European exports.</p>
<p>參加十六國家　應守七大條件</p>
<p>Truman set down seven broad conditions for aid, including requiring assistance in the accumulation of American raw materials in addition to the domestic and commercial export needs of the 16 participating countries. Truman told Congress that every Marshall Plan country would guarantee to take individual and collective action to achieve recovery. Truman also put forward the following conditions (except where impossible to apply): "Promote agricultural and industrial production" so that it can get rid of the abnormal foreign economic assistance. Cooperate with each other "to reduce trade barriers between each other and promote the exchange of goods and gifts" "Balance the currency and establish or maintain confidence in its monetary system." Effectively use American goods and gifts. "Strengthen the production of prescribed raw materials and give priority to the United States in obtaining raw materials for accumulation in order to avoid exceeding reasonable domestic uses and commercial export needs." "Deposit the local currency equivalent to the price of the donated aid goods in a special account, which may be used only after mutual agreement between the two governments." "Information on the development of American aid and agreements between participating countries and between participating countries and the United States should be published domestically and provided to the United States."</p>
<h3>援助方式　分貸款與贈與</h3>
<p>However, Truman warned: "If our previous aid is used improperly, the United States certainly reserves the right to stop aid." He said that part of the aid is in the form of grants and part in the form of loans, and the standard is the solvency of each country. Countries that have the ability to purchase imports with cash or repay loans will not receive grants. Special loans may be needed later to balance currencies, but this cannot be estimated at this time. Truman also said that the promotion of the plan</p>
<h3>推行馬歇爾計劃　成立經濟合作部　受援國應將戰略品售與美國</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The main points of the various bills related to the Marshall aid plan proposed by the US government are as follows: "The plan" will last until June 20, 1952, and the United States will assist Europe in its recovery with $15.1 billion to $17.8 billion. "What Congress is asking for" stipulates that the total US aid to foreign countries for the entire period is $17 billion, but only $6.8 billion can be allocated in the first 15 months starting from April 1, 1948, and gradually reduced to $2.2 billion in the last 12 months. Before Congress begins to allocate funds, $500 million will be paid in advance to transport supplies. The countries that should receive assistance include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland. "Germany's contribution" revives the industrial resources of western Germany to assist the recovery of western Europe, but prevents the revival of militarism. To this end, the military will allocate an additional $822 million during the first 15 months to achieve this goal. "Political conditions" If the political situation in a country changes, the United States may decide whether it can continue to receive US assistance. "Management agency" A new agency called the Economic Cooperation Department is established, nominally equal to other departments of the government, but subject to the control of the Secretary of State on all diplomatic points. "US strategic necessities" European countries and their colonies should sell important strategic necessities to the United States and pay in cash to increase the production of these items. As far as the occasion goes, personal observations will become more and more important. This plan requires "the American people to make a little self-sacrifice," but there is no need to exaggerate this burden too much, because this plan "we can certainly afford it." After comparing the needs of the Marshall Plan with the US national income, Truman said, "This is an investment in the hope of world peace, security, and a better future, and the price is really not high." Truman specifically declared that the United States has no intention of losing contact with other American countries, "I especially want to point out that our current focus on the work in Western Europe does not diminish our interest in long-term economic cooperation with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. As one of the American countries, the American countries are now taking cooperative actions similar to those of European countries, so we must increase production to promote financial balance and eliminate trade barriers. We are fortunate in the Americas that we have already achieved considerable success in this regard, but we should not ignore opportunities for further progress. The European Recovery Program requires supplies from many countries in the Western Hemisphere. This move will stimulate production and commerce and promote the establishment of a world trade on which our prosperity depends."</p>
<h3>確定樂觀信念　應付共黨策略</h3>
<p>Truman criticized the European atmosphere surrounding the Marshall Plan, saying: "We should not ignore the fact that the Communist Party has already declared its determination to oppose all efforts to revive Europe. Strikes will inevitably occur in the future, not to alleviate the difficulties of a certain group, but to create chaos, hoping to achieve totalitarian control. On the contrary, if faith and optimism can be established early, a spark can start a prairie fire, and the progress of European recovery can be greatly accelerated."</p>
<h3>美與歐洲·貿易差額　今後四年內將逾二百億</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] At the same time as President Truman delivered his message, the US State Department also released a report estimating that the trade deficit between Europe and the Western Hemisphere from April 1, 1948, to June 30, 1952, would reach $19.4 billion to $22.1 billion. The report said that in order to make up for this deficit, President Truman will ask Congress to provide $17 billion in aid to Europe, and the remaining shortfall will be made up by increasing loans from the Export-Import Bank and the World Bank, as well as contributions from other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The State Department's report said that in the 15 months starting from April 1 of next year, Huanzhou is expected to obtain 5.2 million tons of bread grains, 800,000 tons of coarse grains, 200,000 tons of fats and oils, 400,000 tons of meat, 700,000 tons of sugar, 150,000 tons of dairy products, 5,000 tons of dried fruits, and 3,000 tons of nitrogen from the United States.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Inspection Difficult, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Advocates Automatic Inventory Registration and Spot Checks</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The authorities previously intended to inspect warehouses throughout the city to stabilize prices and prevent non-businesspeople from hoarding goods. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that he believes that if this measure is not handled properly, it will have adverse consequences and cause materials to evade inspection. There are many warehouses in this city, and the issuance and receipt of goods must be suspended during the inspection period. A three-day suspension will not have a major impact, but a one-week suspension will freeze the materials and stimulate prices. Moreover, during the implementation of the inspection, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no lawless personnel who extort money. There are so many warehouses in this city that even if all the people the municipal government can mobilize are sent, it may take a month to complete the inspection. Therefore, Director Wu believes that the implementation of warehouse inspection has many difficulties and it is more reasonable to implement a method of automatic inventory registration and spot checks. His opinion will be submitted to the Economic Council for discussion.</p>

<h3>Resolution on Fishing Disputes Passed at Temporary Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Executive Yuan held its 14th temporary meeting on the morning of the 19th to discuss pending cases. Several routine cases were approved, as well as a resolution on the dispute between Allied Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) fishing vessels in China and private fishing businesses in Shanghai. It is reported that the solution to the fishing dispute is as follows: (A) Key points of the Fisheries Administration's sale of fishing vessels: Sixty fishing vessels will be allocated and sold to private fishing companies. The sale of fishing vessels should be evenly distributed along the national coast according to the situation of the fishing grounds. The selling price of the fishing vessels should be based on the actual value and paid off in twenty installments over five years. Those who wish to pay off the full amount within two years may do so. All fishing vessels must be used for fishing, otherwise they will be reclaimed. (B) Establish refrigeration and processing plants within a time limit to regulate the market. (C) Before the establishment of refrigeration and processing plants, for all fish caught by the Fisheries Administration's vessels stationed in Shanghai, in addition to at least 500,000 catties being purchased by the Shanghai Fish Market each month, the remaining amount will be purchased and salted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in conjunction with the Central Trust of China, and transported to various regions to be supplied to the people at low prices.</p>
<h3>Missing Daughter of Li Li of Beiping, One Account Says She Left in a Huff, Another Says She Was Abducted</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The famous socialite, Li Li of Beiping, age 35, residing at No. 14, Fanyu Road, West Shanghai, adopted Li Chunhua (currently 17 years old, from Guangdong) from an orphanage in Hong Kong in 1943 through a friend. She brought her to Shanghai in the spring of 1945, and the relationship between mother and daughter was generally good. At around 8:00 PM on the 17th, Li Li went out to see a play. When she returned home at 11:00 PM, she discovered that Chunhua was missing. As of noon the next day, she had not returned. Li reported the incident to the Changning Police Sub-bureau. Chief Shi ordered officer Xu Xianzhong to investigate. It is understood that Li Li scolded her for a minor matter after dinner that day, and she seemed to have left in a huff. According to another rumor, Chunhua was abducted by a man surnamed Dong. The sub-bureau is continuing its investigation to determine whether this is true.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor's Indictment Lists Five Reasons for Corruption Case of UNRRA Officials</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In the UNRRA senior official corruption case, Hou Aichang, Director of the UNRRA Logistics Division and General Manager of the Material Purchasing and Sales Department of the Finance Bureau; Dong Chengdao, Director of the UNRRA Finance Bureau; Tao Jingyuan, Section Chief of the Document Section of the UNRRA Finance Bureau; Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Company; Hu Keshi, former Director of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Jiang Renlin, former Section Chief of the Welfare Section of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Huo Yongzhang, Specialist of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Chen Chao-min, Specialist of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Chen Jiaju, Specialist of the UNRRA Auditing Office; Du Cen, Deputy Chief Auditor of UNRRA; Ding Tiansheng of the United Shengji Construction Factory; and Pang Yuanlong, Chief of the UNRRA Welfare Section, have been indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office. The original indictment is very long. The following is an excerpt of its main points:</p>
<p>Sale of Electric Fans</p>
<p>Regarding the fraudulent sale of electric fans, Hou Aichang was the General Manager of the Material Purchasing and Sales Department. The UNRRA assigned to the Finance Bureau in February, May, and June 1947, two thousand and forty-one boxes and five thousand and seventy-five electric fans to be sold. On May 19, 1947, it was advertised for sale by tender. Zheng Yi Trading Company won the bid at 356,000 yuan per fan. Subsequently, it was advertised for sale again in May and June. Because no one bid, a total of one thousand and four fans were sold by Chen Xu in small quantities. In July, it was advertised for open retail sale at 400,000 yuan per fan. At that time, the market price was 800,000 to 900,000 yuan per fan. There were many applicants. Hou colluded with Tao Jingyuan, Section Chief of the Document Section of the Finance Bureau, to suppress more than 500 application letters from various agencies and organizations after July 4, and sold a total of 4,295 fans in July and August, profiting from it. This has been verified by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office after sending personnel to audit the accounts.</p>
<p>American Cotton for Yarn</p>
<p>Regarding the fraudulent exchange of American cotton for yarn, the Allied Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Bureau's Cotton Yarn Department investigated and determined that the ratio should be 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. Hou, in collusion with Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Bureau, used the excuse that cotton was slippery to store and that insurance was a problem. They signed a contract with Yuzhong and 25 other yarn factories, exchanging 760 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. This resulted in a loss of 90 pounds of cotton for every 760 pounds of cotton from UNRRA. Subsequently, after the Bureau announced the exchange ratio, other manufacturers requested to exchange according to the same standard. Hou and others refused to allow it, and wanted to exchange 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn, as testified clearly by Zhang Lisheng, Managing Director of the Shanghai Yarn Trade Association, and Wang Hongsun, Manager of the China Cloth Company.</p>
<p>Sale of Wool</p>
<p>Regarding the fraudulent sale of wool, Hou and Dong colluded and, without going through bidding procedures, entered into contracts with Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Shanghai Anle Textile Company, in April, September, October, December 1946 and January and February 1947, selling 1.17 million pounds of wool to Anle Company. Deng Zhonghe, the General Manager of the company, gave Hou Aichang an apartment building at No. 1396 Yuyuan Road for his residence, as a reward. According to the defendants Hou Aichang and Deng Zhonghe, although they did not admit to giving or receiving the house, Deng claimed that "the house was sublet to him by Hou's relative Wu Zhiwei" and presented a letter from Wu Zhiwei to Deng Zhonghe dated June 15, 1946, and a business card from Deng Zhonghe to Wu Zhiwei, as proof. The letter was not delivered by the post office, and the paper and ink were new, indicating that it was not an old letter written in June 1946. The business card was written in pencil, making it impossible to verify. It is evident that the letter and business card were fabricated by the defendants Hou and Deng after the fact.</p>
<p>Embezzlement of Public Property</p>
<p>Regarding Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Huo Yongzhang, Chen Zhoumin, Lu Jiaju, Du Cen, and others purchasing furniture, repairing houses, engaging in fraudulent activities, and embezzling public property, when Jiang was the Chief of the Welfare Section, he embezzled 5 million yuan from the section's reserve fund in May 1946, and embezzled 14 valuable tables and chairs from the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory under his management. He colluded with Huo Yongzhang, a specialist in the General Affairs Department, to privately hire contractor Ding Tiansheng to repair the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory, and colluded with Chen Tianmin, a specialist, to purchase furniture from Jinchangxiang Zhiji and Huasheng Hao for personal gain. Du Cen and Lu Jiaju, as the Deputy Chief Auditor and Specialist of the Auditing Office of the Bureau, did not follow the Bureau's auditing procedures when approving the above reimbursements, and signed that the furniture had been used by the Bureau, without the need for auditing. There is a suspicion of collusion and fraud.</p>
<p>Electric Appliances and Refrigerators</p>
<p>Regarding Pang Yuanlong's management of welfare fraud, Pang was originally a specialist in the Bureau. After Jiang Renlin left his position, he was appointed Chief of the Welfare Section. He took the opportunity to take possession of an electric appliance and a refrigerator in the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory.</p>
<p>In summary, according to Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the defendant Jiang Jingyuan and the defendants Hou Aichang and Dong Chengdao are suspected of violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Statute on Punishment of Corruption. In addition to being suspected of violating Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the same law and Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the same Statute together with the defendant Hou Aichang, the defendant Dong Chengdao and the defendant Hou Aichang should be punished according to Article 56 of the same Statute. The defendant Ding Tiansheng is suspected of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 2 of the same Statute, and the defendants Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Shi Yongzhang, and Chen Tianmin are suspected of violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the same Statute. The defendants Du Cen and Lu Jiaju are suspected of violating Article 9 of the same Statute. The defendant Deng Zhonghe is suspected of violating Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the same Statute. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Statute on Criminal Cases and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Malfeasance Involving UNRRA Officials</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Lan Chunchi, a specialist at UNRRA, has been found to have engaged in fraud by privately selling trucks using his position for personal gain. The case has been investigated and confirmed by the bureau, and was yesterday transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. While Lan was serving as the chairman of the Automobile Allocation Review Committee of the bureau, the "Fujian Fu Pu Xian Automobile Transportation Company" applied for the allocation of trucks on December 24 of last year. The Shanghai communication address Zhongzheng West Road 1100 listed on the application was found to be the home of Lan's brother. Furthermore, the application had not been registered and numbered by the receiving and dispatching office before Lan submitted it to the seventh meeting on December 27 of last year and got approval for the allocation of two new trucks. After the trucks were purchased, they were parked at the home of Lan's brother. One of the trucks was later resold to China National Aviation Corporation through the introduction of the Maochang Company for 128,650,000 yuan (the original allocated price was 23,650,000 yuan per truck). After the case was reported, UNRRA and UNRRA both launched investigations, but Lan avoided meeting them by feigning illness.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Agricultural Development is Advancing - After the Provincial Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] Although Zhejiang Province can be considered relatively stable amidst the turmoil in Jiangxi, it is not easy to focus on development. Since Mr. Shen Chengchang took office as provincial governor, he has convened two administrative conferences. The first was in the early autumn of 1946, and the second was in December of 1947. Reviewing the achievements of the first administrative conference, we find that, in addition to progress in governance, transportation, and education, the arbitrary levies and requisitions have indeed been abolished.</p>
<p>Qianjiang Seawall Project</p>
<p>The first phase has indeed been completed. In the Cao'e River basin, ten flood control projects have indeed been completed. In the Pujiang River basin, twelve flood control projects have indeed been completed. In the Donglaoxi River basin, fifteen dikes have been repaired and 142 culverts have been repaired. In the Xizhaohan River basin, eight dredging projects have been completed. In terms of large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, the first and second phases of the Ningbo Dongqian Lake project have indeed been completed on schedule. The Ninghai Army Port project has completed a three-hole sluice gate and over 50,000 cubic meters of river diversion earthwork. Fifty-five counties have undertaken small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, totaling 628 projects. Although much of this was thanks to the flour provided by UNRRA, it still required the efforts of government officials for the many tons of flour to be used efficiently for labor relief. Zhejiang is undoubtedly an agricultural province, so we especially highlight the completion of water conservancy projects, which can be said to show that the government authorities have grasped the key points. However, many agricultural problems remain in Zhejiang, such as the improvement of agricultural tools, the improvement of animal husbandry, the reclamation of wasteland, further research on agricultural specialties, and the widespread introduction of improved crop seeds, all of which are extremely important tasks. Doing anything requires both money and people, with people being the most important. Today, agriculture in Zhejiang should focus on people, so more specialized agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy talents should be recruited and trained and assigned to various counties for application. We have seen that Chairman Shen, in his instructions to the screening committee of the 1947 Provincial Administrative Conference on important related issues, specifically mentioned that the salaries of specialized agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy talents will be specially increased, which can be said to be a way to build Zhejiang agriculture by</p>
<p>Nurturing Wealth and Using Talent.</p>
<p>If agriculture in Zhejiang has made significant progress, then wealth will be even more abundant. With abundant wealth, there will be no reason for bandits to arise, and no reason for corruption and malfeasance to occur. Education will flourish, and the people will be able to live and work in peace. Therefore, the only active and important policy for Zhejiang today should be construction, and the most important aspect of construction should be the improvement and development of agriculture. The result of the 1946 Provincial Administrative Conference was the abolition of arbitrary levies and requisitions as a negative aspect, and the construction of several agricultural water conservancy projects as a positive aspect. We also eagerly hope that the result of the 1947 Administrative Conference will be that no civil servant in the province will be corrupt or engage in malfeasance as a negative aspect, and that the province's grain production will increase significantly, the province's specialty products will be greatly improved, and agricultural tools will reach the level of modernization as a positive aspect.</p>
<p>The reporter always believes that, in the current situation where agriculture is the foundation of Zhejiang Province, all levels of schools should especially strengthen the inculcation of agricultural knowledge, and at the same time have a particularly clear understanding of their own hometowns. We eagerly hope that the government will assign cadres to the villages to work together on rural construction, and hold regular competitions to observe their achievements. Another important issue regarding agricultural development is the</p>
<p>Support of Owner-Cultivators.</p>
<p>The government's current implementation of the 25% rent reduction has had some effect in several counties, but it has still not been fully implemented in many places. We should count the wasteland in the whole county, encourage reclamation, and at the same time use the power of the government to especially reward owner-cultivators, so that owner-cultivators can gradually increase in number and truly achieve equal land rights. However, this work also requires those in power to personally go to the countryside and contact the farmers in order to achieve results.</p>
<p>I believe that in today's turbulent times, our Zhejiang needs to achieve stability amidst the turmoil, and</p>
<p>Construction Amidst Stability.</p>
<p>This is certainly not an easy task, but we only need to think about what the unit of stability is. Of course, it cannot be separated from the people. In Zhejiang, more than 80% of the people are farmers. As long as we stabilize the rural areas, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>The 1946 Provincial Administrative Conference has already revealed the bright future of Zhejiang's agricultural development. After the 1947 Provincial Administrative Conference, we hope that under the leadership of Chairman Shen, the development of agriculture in Zhejiang Province will be pushed forward by hundreds and thousands of steps.

<h3>Strong Clan Mentality Prevents Resolution of Disputes in Dan County</h3>
<p>[Aboard from Haikou, Hainan Island, 16th] Clan feuds have plagued Dan County, Hainan Island, for decades, often turning villages into ruins, and leading to the humiliation and murder of wives and scholars, and mutual killings. Despite repeated exhortations and dissuasion by local administrative authorities, the deep-seated prejudices persist and the trend has not been curbed. Recently, residents of the county residing in Haikou held a special symposium to discuss solutions, and formulated four concrete measures for adoption by Commissioner Han Hanying. To understand the cause of clan feuds, our reporter visited certain individuals, who said: The clan feuds in the county have reached a state of</p>
<p>Deep Rootedness</p>
<p>to the extent that they cannot be eliminated overnight. The matter of clan feuds has a long history, dating back to the late Qing Dynasty. Wang, from Shajing Village, obtained the status of Jinshi and then ran rampant in the countryside, relying on his power to humiliate the villagers, arbitrarily seizing fertile fields, and forcibly taking women. The people hated him to the core. Wu, a Bagong from Tangdi Village, a neighboring village, witnessed Wang's rampant power and rose up to speak out against injustice, and reported the matter to Li Xi, the then magistrate. Magistrate Li summoned both parties for trial, but Wang</p>
<p>Roared in Court</p>
<p>angering the magistrate, who then charged Wang with ten major crimes and executed him in the market in Dan. From then on, the Wu and Wang clans formed a deep-seated hatred, leading to fierce clan feuds. Later, due to the advantageous conditions of geographical environment and kinship, each formed</p>
<h3>Li Shumei, Logistics Officer of Tongshan Garrison District, Apprehended After Fleeing</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] Li Shumei, a first-class logistics officer of the Tongshan Garrison District Headquarters of the Northern Jiangsu Garrison District, was recently dismissed from his position for some reason. However, Li refused to hand over his duties and seized the opportunity to flee. Today, he was apprehended by the Criminal Investigation Team of the County Police Bureau based on a tip-off. Li admitted to fleeing without hesitation. The Police Bureau has telegraphed the Tongshan Garrison District to send personnel to Suzhou to escort him back for trial. Parties, each establishing a separate faction to oppose each other, involving eighteen surnames such as Wu, Chen, Li, and He, against twenty-four surnames such as Wang, Li, Fu, Tang, Sun, and Yang. The clan feuds escalated and became uncontrollable. It was not until 1928 that both sides suffered heavy losses and their vitality was greatly reduced that the matter subsided slightly. In 1932, the Chen and He surnames in Shenque Pit fought again over stones and wood. Because the mediator's mediation was ineffective, the Chen clan leader was shot and executed, thus causing a new generation of feuds between the Chen and He families. In 1935, the Chen and Wu surnames in Sandu territory also fought over stones. Before the enemy landed, there was another clan feud between the Chen and Yang surnames in Sandu territory. After the victory, for various complex reasons, the two sides failed to</p>
<p>Overcome Prejudices.</p>
<p>Some even used the opportunity to scheme and attack each other, resulting in the clan feud wind never being lessened. In short, although the clan feuds in Dan County have various causes, the strong clan mentality and strong feudal colors of the general public, which prevents the two sides from overcoming old grievances and forming new friendships, is the biggest factor.</p>

<h3>Our Country Does Not Plan to Participate in Activities of the World Student Union; Student Unions of Finland and Norway Will Not Attend Next Meeting</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanking, 19th of this Month] Ministry of Education reports: Our country does not plan to participate in any future activities of the World Student Union. The situation with the World Student Union headquarters in Prague is extremely complex. Since the World Youth Festival this summer, the true nature of the Union has become increasingly clear. According to the November 7th commentary in the Czech Social Democratic Party newspaper, Free Word, the Union is part of a communist international organization. This fact is known not only to students but also to officials in various countries. The Union excludes organizations that it finds inconvenient, such as the Chinese Student Association, in order to include organizations from so-called "liberated areas" in China. Similarly, it allows only a student union organized by communists, representing only one-fifth of all Italian students, to join on behalf of Italy. The commentary continues: Unless the Union changes its current political views, student unions from Finland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Scotland, and New Zealand will not attend the next meeting.</p>

<h3>Hu Shih Arrived in Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Peiping, 19th of this Month] Hu Shih returned to Peiping from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. today. Mr. Hu expressed admiration for the establishment of the Sino-American Education Fund Board, believing that the United States' passage of this farsighted bill would make a significant contribution to promoting Sino-American friendship. While Chinese schools in general would benefit, those receiving special assistance, such as Peking Union Medical College and various mission schools, would continue to benefit the Chinese people, which is only right and proper.

<p>Fang Xikong Stated Yesterday That Party Groups Have Withdrawn From Schools</p>
<p>Chairman Fang stated in his address that it is unreasonable that school administrators today are busy with school economic problems and trivial matters. Local authorities are eager to assist schools in solving difficulties, as exemplified by the current fundraising for scholarships. Mr. Fang continued that since the consolidation of Party groups, they have completely withdrawn from schools. He hoped that in the future, teachers and students in various schools would prioritize academic research over political activities, in order to cultivate talent for the country.

Given the cold reception to the National Assembly elections last month, university groups cannot sit idly by.

The Scholarship Unified Review Committee expressed its gratitude to the municipal authorities and the various donating organizations, and offered two points based on their experiences handling scholarships this semester: (A) Please issue scholarships earlier in the future, so that the recipients can truly benefit. (B) Please announce the methods for scholarships with attached conditions as soon as possible, in order to fulfill them and achieve the desired effect. The issue of tuition fees for private schools next semester will be discussed at the next meeting. In order to strengthen extracurricular activities in each school, in addition to the original Sports Committee, a Speech and Debate Committee will be established, with Fudan, Shanghai, Shanghai Business School, Shanghai Law School, and Lixin Five Schools as members, with Fudan as the convener. The Academic Advancement Committee will consist of Datong, Tongji, Guang, Da, and Political Science and Law College Five Schools, with Datong as the convener.

<h3>Summary of the 1947-1948 Basketball New Rules (Continued and Finished)</h3>
<p>When jumping the ball in the center circle or on the free-throw line, the other eight non-jumping players should all stand outside the restricted area before the ball is tapped. During the jump ball, teammates may not stand side by side in the restricted area (unless the opposing team does not need to occupy one of the positions in the location where they are standing).</p>
<p>The above rules also apply to jump balls that are not performed within the restricted area, except for the assumed restricted area that is a considerable distance from the jumping players. Note of Article 1 of Chapter 7 has been revised and incorporated into Article 2 of Chapter 1.</p>
<p>(Official Note) Article has been shortened because part has been incorporated into Article 5 of Chapter 2. The meaning has not changed. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Officials' instructions for announcing out-of-bounds balls should be clear. If a player has doubts about the judgment, the official should take the ball away and wait for the judgment to be understood before proceeding to throw the ball. (Refer to Article 5 of Chapter 2 for the rules on handing the ball to the player with the right to throw it).</p>
<p>Article 5 of Chapter 8 adds a "Special Case" section to conform to the old rule using "the center circle jump ball method to begin each half or each decisive period of the game." The full sentence is as follows:</p>
<p>(Special Case) If a foul in the first item occurs before the beginning of each half or each decisive period, then after the free throw, a jump ball should be used in the center circle to begin the game.</p>
<p>Article 4 (E) of Chapter 10 is a newly added rule that lists examples of technical fouls. Item (E) in Article 7 of Chapter 4 states that any avoidable physical contact during a stoppage in the game is considered a technical foul against the spirit of sportsmanship. The full sentence is as follows:</p>
<p>(E) Making unnecessary movements that cause physical contact during a stoppage in the game.</p>
<p>The penalty rules in Article 7 of Chapter 10 have been recompiled, but the original meaning has not been changed.</p>
<p>The meaning of "continuous action" in the note has been expanded to include a ball that has been tapped and rebounded, or a legal step during a shot. This provision provides officials with a more definitive basis for judging situations where "an opposing player commits a foul against a player after the ball has left the hand, but the shot should be considered valid if the ball goes in." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>If an opposing player commits a foul against a player, and that player has already made part of the shooting motion before the foul (including a ball that has been tapped and rebounded or a legal step during a shot), then the shot should be considered valid if the ball goes in, even if the ball leaves the hand after the whistle has blown, as long as the whistle does not affect the game. The player must be continuing or beginning the shooting motion when the whistle blows, but if the timekeeper's signal sounds before the ball enters the air, then the shot is invalid.</p>
<p>Article 8 of Chapter 10 is a new rule that allows a player to waive a free throw after a personal foul. It was previously part of Article 7 of Chapter 10, but the meaning has been changed. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When a free throw is awarded for a personal foul, the captain of the free-throwing team may declare that they are waiving the free throw, unless there is another free throw in succession, or a jump ball in the center circle (as in Article 7 of Chapter 8). After waiving the free throw, any player on the team should throw the ball in from the boundary in the center court to continue the game.</p>

<h3>National Bank Requests Prohibition of Cash Flow into Shanghai; Ministry of Finance to Order Customs to Conduct Thorough Inspections</h3>
<p>Since the National Bank's order restricting remittances, funds from various places have continued to flow into the city. The methods include: remittances from commercial banks and firms, carrying cash. However, commercial banks and firms are limited in number due to restrictions from the National Bank, so most still transport cash to Shanghai. There are also three ways in which cash comes: Ships, trains, planes, all three means of transportation by sea, land and air, are used as much as possible. It is reported that the amount of cash transported to Shanghai is very large. Unofficial statistics show that it exceeded 300 billion in the week. In the past, in order to restrict the southward flow of funds, the government strictly prohibited the transportation of cash to Guangzhou, but other places were not restricted.

The Ministry of Finance, as its duty, will have specific measures. It will order the customs to conduct thorough inspections, and if anyone is found carrying large amounts of cash, it will be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Both Supply and Demand are Scarce in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sellers in the tea market, in view of the fact that the foreign exchange rate has increased by more than 10% and there are two days of holidays, were more determined to sell than before.

In terms of prices, there was no obvious progress due to the relationship between goods, but compared with the previous day, it was consistently obvious but still flat.</p>
<h3>Fewer Bank Entries and Exits; Tight Monetary Conditions Slightly Eased; Total Entries and Exits Exceed 1 Trillion Since the 10th</h3>

Currently, the silver industry has three opinions on improving the collection techniques: 1) Calculate the standard based on interest income plus fee income, minus interest expense plus fee expense. 2) The special business tax for branches and sub-branches should be submitted by the head office. Currently, the special tax for various banks and firms in Shanghai is calculated from July of this year. Other regions are calculated from May. 3) Each silver firm should submit a monthly report to the Ministry of Finance, and request that the special tax payable be calculated based on the monthly report, without further account verification. It is reported that the authorities are expected to accept the first two opinions, but the third opinion is unlikely to be accepted. The special tax for the second half of the 36th year for various banks and firms in this city will be levied from July 1st to December 31st. It is now scheduled to begin filing on January 10th of next year. It is estimated that the largest commercial bank will have to pay approximately 1.1 billion in special taxes. It is expected that the total special tax payable by the banking industry in the city will be approximately 30 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of the Gold and Currency Trading Penalties by the Financial Control Bureau</h3>
<p>The revised penalties for trading in gold and foreign currencies, promulgated by the National Government on the 19th, have been ordered to be strictly enforced by the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It has been reported that they have consulted with the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Police Department yesterday, and will strictly enforce the penalties from today. Excerpts from the revised penalties for trading in gold and foreign currencies are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Anyone who buys or sells gold or foreign currency without legal permission, or uses gold or foreign currency to replace currency for transactions, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, detention, or a fine, or both, not exceeding one time the price of the object of the transaction. If it is a silver firm, its business license shall be revoked, and the manager shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years, and may also be fined one to three times the price of the object of the transaction. The same shall apply to non-silver firms that habitually engage in the illegal buying and selling of gold and foreign currency. The aforementioned gold and foreign currency shall be confiscated, whether or not it belongs to the offender. The property used to buy the gold and foreign currency shall also be confiscated; if all or part of it cannot be confiscated, its value shall be recovered.</p>
<p>Article 2: The amount of gold that each person may carry out of the country is limited to two liang. The amount of foreign currency that each person may carry out of the country is limited to US$100 or its equivalent in other foreign currency; the excess shall be confiscated by customs, unless approved by the government.</p>
<p>Article 3: The amount of gold that each person may carry into the country is limited to ten liang. The amount of foreign currency that each person may carry into the country is limited to US$100 or its equivalent in other foreign currency. The amount exceeding the limit shall be declared to customs and registered, and exchanged for national currency at the market price at the local central bank or its authorized exchange on the day of entry. Those who conceal and fail to report after being questioned by customs shall have the excess confiscated by customs.</p>
<p>Article 4: If a traveler crossing the border carries gold or foreign currency exceeding the limit specified in the preceding article, the excess may be declared to customs upon entry, and entrusted to customs for safekeeping. The original item may be retrieved with the safekeeping certificate and proof of departure within six months of departure; after the deadline, customs shall send the item to the central bank to exchange for national currency at the market price, and the safekeeping certificate shall be returned.</p>
<p>Article 5: Items confiscated and recovered in accordance with the wooden regulations shall be immediately turned over to the national treasury.</p>

<h3>On Buddhism and Translated Literature (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yiliang</p>
<p>In the Biography of Kumarajiva in Volume 2 of the Biographies of Eminent Monks in the Liang Dynasty, it is recorded that this great translator of scriptures in the Yao Qin era commented on translation, saying, "Changing Sanskrit to Chinese loses its elegance. Although the general meaning is obtained, the literary style is very different. It is like chewing food for others, which not only loses the flavor, but also makes one vomit." Even a master translator like Kumarajiva said this. If we want to study translated Buddhist scriptures from a literary point of view, aren't we trying to find flavor in food that someone else has chewed? Strictly speaking, of course, no translated work can replace the original. However, the translation of Buddhist scriptures in China lasted for more than a thousand years from the Later Han Dynasty to the Northern Song Dynasty. So many people participated, and the content of the translated scriptures was so broad. At the same time, the original versions of these classics are now extremely rare, relying entirely on the translated versions to be circulated. In no other language in the world is there probably such a collection of translated literature! Even though it is food that has been chewed, there is still value in re-chewing it, that is without a doubt.</p>
<p>Chinese scholars have always disdained to look at the books of "heretics" and "two clans." The Qing Dynasty historian Qian Daxin, whose learning can be described as profound and extensive, made a very serious mistake in his postscript to the inscriptions on metal and stone in the Qianyan Hall, in which he examined the establishment years of the Tang Dynasty's official in charge of repairing meritorious deeds in the monasteries of the capital, because he did not refer to the records of Buddhists. This is a very good example. In recent decades, the academic atmosphere has undergone a tremendous change. On the one hand, many new materials have been discovered, and on the other hand, materials that were not noticed by predecessors have also been used. Those who discuss Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist history certainly have to look at the Tripitaka, and even scholars who study history or Sino-Western communication have obtained many useful materials from Buddhist writings. Only those who study literature or literary history have not been able to fully utilize translated Buddhist scriptures, and that is what this article wants to discuss.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih, in his History of Vernacular Literature, once devoted a special section to discussing translated Buddhist literature and gave examples to illustrate his point, which can be described as uniquely insightful. Shen Congwen's collection of short stories, "Moonlight Scenery", and Su Xuelin's play, "Kunnara's Eyes", as well as the late Xu Dishan's several short stories, are all taken from translated Buddhist scriptures and are very successful. All can be described as the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. I now want to look at translated Buddhist literature from three perspectives.</p>
<p>The first is to treat it as pure literature. For example, the parable of the burning house in the Lotus Sutra is an extremely beautiful literary work in the original text, and Kumarajiva's translation is also quite sufficient to convey the emotion of the original text. As in the narrative of the fire: "Later, the house suddenly caught fire. The flames blazed on all sides at once. The sound of the beams and pillars cracking shook the ground. They collapsed and fell, and the walls collapsed. All the ghosts and gods shouted loudly. The vultures, crows, and kumbhandas of Liju were in a state of confusion and panic, unable to get out. Evil beasts and poisonous insects hid in holes." It is written in a way that conveys the meaning of a raging fire. Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita is a poem narrating the life of Buddha, and half of the original text still exists. It is also one of the best works in the history of Sanskrit literature. The translator is now generally considered to be Dharmaraksa, a monk from Central India who came east during the Northern Liang Dynasty, but there are still some questions, which will not be discussed here. This translation is not as faithful or literary as Kumarajiva's, but it is not impossible to glimpse the literary meaning of the original text. For example, the chapter "Contemplation of Disgust" describes how the king had to allow the prince to go out for a trip, but was afraid that he would see old age, sickness, ugliness, and filth and develop a sense of disgust and detachment: "When the king saw the prince arrive, he stroked his head and looked at his face. His feelings of sorrow and joy were intertwined, and he allowed him to go with his mouth, but kept him in his heart." It is written in great detail. It's just that "stroked his head" in the original text is Sirasyupa-gliraya, which originally refers to a type of Indian etiquette involving both smelling and kissing. The translation was adapted to suit the Chinese national conditions, and therefore it was translated as "stroked his head" instead of "smelled his head." Again, the chapter "Sorrow and Grief of the Whole Palace" describes how the prince entered the mountains to cultivate the Tao, and the charioteer Chandaka and the white horse returned. The prince's wife, Yasodhara, blamed the charioteer Chandaka, saying: "The one I admired is dead. Where is he now? The man and the horse went together, but now only two have returned! My heart is extremely frightened, trembling and uneasy. You are ultimately an unjust person, not intimate, not a good friend, not auspicious, even if strong! What is the use of weeping? To take him away and then return weeping is completely inconsistent! ... Therefore, the holy prince has gone and will never return. You should be very happy now, for your evil deeds have been accomplished. It is better to be close to wise enemies than to associate with foolish friends. You are nominally a good friend, but in reality, you harbor resentment! Today, this superior artisan's home has been completely destroyed in one day!" Although it is not as smooth as the original text, it is sufficient to express the spicy tone of a woman. "The one I admired is dead" is based on the Korean Tripitaka. The three versions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties all say "the one in my heart." According to the original text, what is similar to this sentence is Gatah kvasa chandaka manmanorathah. Meaning, "Chandaka, where is the one who pleases my heart?" The "one in my heart" of the three versions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties may be closer to the truth than "the one I admired."</p>
<p>The two examples cited above happen to be originals that still exist. There are also originals that no longer exist, and we can only appreciate them through translated versions. The Fo Benxing Jing translated by Bao Yun of the Liu Song Dynasty can be used as a representative. This is also a biography of the Buddha. The chapter "Dwelling with the Maidens" describes how the prince's wife had a dream at night, in which she dreamed that the prince had abandoned her and gone into the mountains and forests. She "chased and called out incessantly, and the prince entered the forest. Her mind became frantic, and she sought him tree by tree. She howled to the trees, saying: 'You alone have no worries, but I alone am troubled! Show me the prince!' She looked up and saw a red-beaked bird on the tree. She complained to the bird: 'I have lost my protector. Your voice resembles his. I will give you my voice! May your cry remove the sorrow from my heart!' She also saw the tree, saying: 'Why are you not compassionate? I am in distress and have lost my protector. I am lost and have committed offenses. I have been abandoned by my virtuous husband. You should show me comfort and sorrow. Why do I see the lotus? Why don't the flowers bloom?' ...Moved by the wind, the branches of the tree bent down. 'It is as if I am being beaten with a stick!' The birds and beasts looked at her: 'You did not send your husband away!' The sound of the water was like scolding: 'I am not able to cure the prince and he will not return!' Then she cried and rejoiced, saying: 'Leave your eyes like blue lotuses... Leave the flowering lotus, leave your golden face, leave your hair to ward off soldiers. I saw him abandon me!' Before she finished speaking, she suddenly saw the prince among the trees in the forest. She went forward and grabbed him, saying: 'Why did you abandon me?' After speaking, she woke up with a start, holding the prince, ashamed, fearful, and trembling." There are several sentences in this passage that are quite difficult to understand. Before we find a better version to correct the errors, or suitable materials to explain them, we can only suspend our judgment. However, judging from the parts that we can understand, this passage is already very poetic and full of fantasy. Sanskrit literature is very fond of using puns. Here, "no worries" must be Asoka in the original text, which is the name of a tree, and also has the meaning of "no worries." "Leave your eyes" and so on means that after the prince left, he left a souvenir for others, which they could use to remember him, but only she had not received anything. "Golden flower" refers to the flower of the Asoka tree. One of the thirty-two marks of Shakyamuni is that his "skin is soft, smooth, and the color of purple polished gold," which is why "leave your golden face." The so-called "ward off soldiers" may be the "ward off soldiers silk" mentioned in books such as the Customs Records of Jingchu. This is naturally using inherent Chinese objects to compare with Western objects, such as the way Yijing used willow branches to translate Dantakastha. But I have not been able to determine what the original text is, maybe it is the sash worn by Brahmins? The above are just a few random examples. There are certainly many more chapters with literary meaning that can be found in Buddhist scriptures. In the future, those who compile literary history, at least those who write the history of medieval literature, will certainly give translated Buddhist literature an important place, right?</p>
<h3>Discussion on the "Western Continent Song"</h3>
<p>— You Guoen</p>
<p>In the "Yuefu" poetry collection, there is a song called "Western Continent Song," titled "Ancient Lyrics." Some believe it was written by Emperor Wu of Liang, while others attribute it to Jiang Yan, but both are incorrect. It is a genuine folk song from the Jiangnan region, and no scholar of the Six Dynasties could have composed a single phrase of it. Not only is its style beyond the imitation of scholars, but considering just the ten characters "Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green," even people of the High Tang Dynasty probably couldn't imitate it. How could authors of the Six Dynasties have dreamed of it?</p>
<p>However, I don't want to discuss the authorship of the "Western Continent Song" right now. What I want to raise is a problem that is most easily overlooked by general readers of such popular folk songs, a problem that even poses a challenge to interpretation. Let me first transcribe the full text of the song lyrics below:</p>
<p>"Remember picking plums below the Western Continent, breaking off plum blossoms to send to the north of the river. Wearing a thin apricot-red shirt, her hair as black as a crow's young. Where is the Western Continent? It's at the ferry beyond Double-Punting Bridge. At dusk, the shrike flies, the wind blows the Chinese tallow tree. Under the tree is the doorway, in the doorway gleams a jade hairpin. Opening the door, my love doesn't arrive; going out to pick red lotuses. Picking lotuses in the southern pond in autumn, the lotus flowers taller than a person's head. Lowering her head to play with lotus seeds, the lotus seeds clear as water. Placing the lotus seeds in her sleeve, her thoughts are thoroughly red. Remembering my love, my love doesn't arrive, raising her head to watch the flying geese. Geese fly all over the Western Continent, hoping my love will ascend the green tower; from the tower, he can't be seen, all day at the railing. The railing has twelve bends, her dangling hands bright as jade. Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green. The sea in my dreams stretches on and on, your sorrow is also my sorrow. The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent." I want to ask first:</p>
<p>(1) Are the opening two lines in the woman's tone or the man's tone?</p>
<p>(2) Is the female protagonist's home—the Western Continent—north or south of the river?</p>
<p>(3) If it is in Jiangnan, then how should the final two lines, "The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent," be interpreted?</p>
<p>(4) If it is north of the river, then how should those two lines be interpreted?</p>
<p>(5) Whose tone are the four lines from "The sea in my dreams stretches on and on" onwards?</p>
<p>(6) If it is the man's tone, then the man is in Jiangnan, while the woman is in the north of the river.</p>
<p>(7) If it is the woman's tone, doesn't it clearly mean that the woman is in Jiangnan, and the man is north of the river? In this case, the Western Continent becomes the man's home. All these questions must have correct answers before this poem can be understood and avoid being self-contradictory.</p>
<p>The most difficult parts of this poem to explain are the opening two lines and the concluding four lines. The opening two lines say, "Remember picking plums below the Western Continent, breaking off plum blossoms to send to the north of the river." Whose tone is this? I believe it is naturally the man's tone. He should be saying: I (the man) am now thinking of you (the woman), and I really want to come to the Western Continent to see you. And you, coincidentally, sent a plum blossom to express my longing. How fitting! The "remembering plums" in the first line is the man's doing, and the "sending plums" in the next line is the woman's doing. The first line is from the man's perspective, and the second line is from the woman's perspective. So I thought of something: these two "plum" characters are definitely not used casually. The "plum" character is very likely the woman's given name or surname. Therefore, when her lover was thinking of her, she immediately sent him a plum blossom so that seeing the object would be like seeing the person. So I assume that remembering plums and sending plums must belong to both the man and the woman, and should not be regarded as a one-sided matter. I think it must be explained in this way for the opening two lines to have meaning; otherwise, both saying "remembering plums" and "sending plums" don't make sense in fact, whether it's the man or the woman.</p>
<p>Since remembering plums and sending plums have been determined to be the affairs of both the man and the woman, it is naturally determined that the woman lives in the Western Continent (and there is even explicit textual evidence in the poem). And the man lives north of the river. Therefore, it is further known that since the man lives north of the river, the Western Continent where the woman lives must be in Jiangnan. Once the residences of both the man and woman and their positions have been clarified, then all the problems of this poem will be largely solved.</p>
<p>It turns out it's like this: a man living north of the river suddenly thinks of his lover, and the horses of consciousness keep circling in his mind. Therefore, this poem starts with a "remembering" character, and from then on, it is always "remembering" what he said. "Wearing a thin apricot-red shirt, her hair as black as a crow's young," is remembering her clothes and appearance. "Where is the Western Continent?" to "in the doorway gleams a jade hairpin" is remembering her doorway and decorations. "Opening the door, my love doesn't arrive" to "all day at the railing" is remembering her life and thoughts, and remembering that she is thinking of her lover at all times. The four lines of "The railing has twelve bends" not only recall the structure of her residence but also recall the scenery of that residence. The two lines "Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green" combined with the two lines above, "From the tower, he can't be seen, all day at the railing," have the divine taste of "The song ends, but the person is not seen; on the river, several peaks are green." Liu Zihou's "Leisurely, it is with the vast Qi, and there is no end; Boundless, it travels with the Creator, and does not know its limit," seems to be in the same realm, truly a divine product in poetry. Since the poem started with "plum," and the plum is a flower of winter and spring, it "remembers" in order according to the seasons of the year. Thus, going out to pick lotuses and placing them in her sleeve, and thus, looking up at the flying geese and climbing the tower to look around. Because picking lotuses is a matter of summer and autumn (of course, there are also songs like "Midnight Song" using "lotus" as a homophone for "cherish"), and flying geese are only available in autumn and winter (of course, there is also the meaning of looking forward to news and wanting to fly away like a swan). "Southern pond in autumn" clearly points out the season, and the two characters "sky high" also subtly point out the autumn scenery ("The sky is high, and the air is clear" are the words of Song Yu's "Nine Laments" about autumn). You see, he talks about plums, lotuses, and flying geese, thinking from winter and spring to summer and autumn, undoubtedly a four-season longing.</p>
<p>The final four lines, "The sea in my dreams stretches on and on, your sorrow is also my sorrow. The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent," this ending makes me hesitate again. If we continue from the previous text, it is naturally still the man's tone; but the problem lies in the fact that the two characters "south wind" don't make sense. There are very few examples in ancient poems and "Yuefu" songs of addressing a woman as "Jun" (lord/you) is still secondary. Because the man is originally in Jiangbei, and the woman is originally in Jiangnan, logically, it should be said "north wind," why specifically say "south wind"? Saying "south wind" means the man should be in Jiangnan and the woman should be in Jiangbei. This is exactly the opposite of the facts. If it is the woman's tone, naturally the problem of the "Jun" character is solved, but the difficulty of the "south wind" still exists. Because in this way, the woman is indeed in Jiangnan, but the Western Continent is instead in Jiangbei and becomes the man's home, wouldn't that be even more contradictory to what is described in the poem?</p>
<p>How should it be explained to make sense? I think this ending is more correct as the woman's tone. You only need to look at the "also" character in "your sorrow is also my sorrow" to know that the tone has already changed at this point. Because everything written before is nothing more than the man thinking of the woman. He thinks that the woman is in a high tower, gazing intently all day long, not seeing even the shadow of her lover, only seeing the vast sea, the endless green waves swaying in the sky and water connected. Writing to this point, it suddenly changes the tone and adopts the woman's voice:</p>
<p>"Oh, that boundless sea! It is truly as vague as a dream. Longing for each other but unable to meet, you are sorrowful, and how am I not sorrowful too?—But when it comes to "dreams," "dreams" are also good. If the south wind (i.e., the wind blowing southward, actually the north wind) knows my thoughts, it will blow you from your dream to the Western Continent so that we can meet in a dream. Isn't that better than being separated all day and suffering for longing?"</p>
<p>Many "Yuefu" songs use dialogue, often in the form of questions and answers between the two sides. Although this poem is not a direct dialogue, the final four lines are indeed a clear expression made by the woman because the man is thinking of her. Of course, it still has the meaning of dialogue. Such a conclusion makes it even more extraordinary. "Mulberry on the Roadside," "Feathered Forest" and other poems also have the same style. In this way, all problems are solved.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people suspect that the two characters "south wind" cannot be explained in this way. But why doubt this? In the letter that the people of the Six Dynasties attributed to Li Ling answering Su Wu, wasn't there clearly the sentence "Sometimes due to the north wind, I receive your kind words"? Li Ling was in the Xiongnu, and Su Wu was in Chang'an. Logically, it should be said "south wind," but not saying "south wind" and saying "north wind" isn't it often used to mean the wind coming from the north or blowing towards the north?</p>
<p>Finally, if someone asks: "Since the final four lines are in the woman's tone, couldn't the woman also be north of the river?" My answer is still "no." Because in this way, the sentence "sending plums to the north of the river" would be difficult to explain. The poem says "north of the river," clearly implying the location of the man. The juxtaposition of "north of the river" and "Western Continent" clearly indicates two different directions.</p>
<p>(Written in Beiping on December 11, 1947)</p>
<h3>"Archaeology in Gansu"</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Pei Wenzhong, recorded by the History Society of Peking University</p>
<p>I. The Work is a Continuation of the Predecessors'</p>
<p>This time, I went to Gansu to do prehistoric archaeological work under the order of the Central Geological Survey. Starting from Beiping in June this year and returning to Beiping in early November, it lasted about five months. This work is a continuation of the work of Mr. J.G. Andersson twenty years ago. From 1923 to 1924, Mr. An and Mr. Yuan Fuli went to Gansu and Qinghai to conduct prehistoric human surveys. Their footprints reached three areas: the Huanghe River (Xining River) basin, the Tao River basin, and the vicinity of Minqin (Zhenfan). Mr. An divided the prehistoric culture of these three regions into six periods: Qijia period, Yangshao period (Banshan and Majiayao in the Tao River basin), Machang period, Xindian period, Siwa period, and Shajing period. Mr. An believed that the first three periods were the late Neolithic Age, and the latter three periods had reached the Bronze Age. He estimated that the time was about from 2500 to 500 BC. Mr. An also believed that these six periods were continuous and evolved in a single line, divided into six periods due to different times. Mr. An named the culture represented by these six periods "Yangshao Culture." Also, because the pottery used in that period was painted with colorful patterns, it was also known as "Painted Pottery Culture." Mr. An's discoveries and research results aroused worldwide attention. Mr. An has returned to his country for more than 20 years, and we have not been able to continue his unfinished work. This year, Mr. Zhu Taiheng and I went to Gansu. Although there are no achievements to speak of, it can be regarded as that we still intend to continue the work of our predecessors.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Xia Ding of the Academia Sinica and Mr. Huang Wenbi of the Peiping Research Institute did a lot of important archaeological work in the Northwest, but their reports have not been published, so we cannot use them as a reference, which is a pity.</p>
<p>II. A Total of Four Regions Were Traveled</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Taiheng and I traveled a total of four regions this time: the upper reaches of the Wei River (from Tianshui to Longxi), the Xihan River basin (i.e., the upper reaches of the Jialing River, Chengxian, Lixian, Xihe, etc.), the Tao River basin (Taosha to Lintao), and the Da Xia River basin (Linxia and Ningding County). From these four regions, we discovered more than 90 prehistoric sites of eight categories, among which more than ten should continue to be excavated on a large scale.</p>
<p>(1) Upper Reaches of the Wei River</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Xusheng and Mr. Su Bingqi of the Peiping Research Institute have already done archaeological work in the lower reaches of the Wei River. This time we investigated the upper reaches of the Wei River. The prehistoric culture of this region can be divided into three periods: the early period, which is the "Yangshao period" as Mr. An called it. This is the most prosperous period of painted pottery culture. The application of painted pottery is very extensive, and the production is also exquisite. In the middle period, painted pottery has declined, and the application is less, and the production is also coarser. In the late period, painted pottery will disappear, and occasionally there is painted pottery, and its decorations are also very simple. The reason for the decline of painted pottery culture, I personally think, is because it was directly influenced by "primitive Chinese culture." I don't know the details of what I call "primitive Chinese culture" yet, I only know that it is the culture before the Yin culture.</p>
<p>(2) Xihan River Basin</p>
<p>This area is roughly the same as the upper reaches of the Wei River, but it has a slight local character. From this area, you can know the distribution of painted pottery culture to the south.</p>
<p>(3) Tao River Basin</p>
<p>This area is connected to the upper reaches of the Wei River by Weiyuan. In this area, during the heyday of painted pottery culture, that is, the Yangshao period, the tombs had the "Banshan" area, and the residences had Majiayao and Siwa Mountain. In these many places, the exquisiteness of the production and the wide application of painted pottery are the same as in the upper reaches of the Wei River.</p>
<p>After this period, in the Tao River basin, the painted pottery culture also gradually declined, but not as fast as in the upper reaches of the Wei River. My opinion is that the painted pottery culture declined more slowly because it was less influenced by primitive Chinese culture. The first period of decline is the Machang period as Mr. An called it. However, the Machang period in the Da Xia River and Huang River basins is more developed than in the Tao River basin.</p>
<p>After the Machang period is the Xindian period, which is particularly developed in the Tao River basin. People in this period still used painted pottery, but the production was rough, and it was obvious that the industrial center had shifted to other aspects (such as bronze ware). The culture of this period was also influenced by primitive Chinese culture. For example, the patterns on pottery often have thunder patterns and geometric patterns, which is a clear proof. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Discussion with Mr. Lu Jiye on "Arranging the Order of Music"</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi'e</p>
<p>The difference between the two versions is so great that Mr. Lu did not make a choice and used them to write a book. This is really inappropriate.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu said that "Arranging the Order of Music" is the origin of "drama lists." This directly regards "Arranging the Order of Music" as a proper noun. I think this is still debatable. Because in "Old Events in Wulin," there is often the word "arrangement"; "Arranging the Order of Music" is only used together once. It can be seen that "arrangement" and "order of music" are not necessarily fixed proper nouns that must be closely linked together, but are independent words. For example,</p>
<p>Dragon Boat Festival entry: "The Academy of Scholars provides posts in advance, such as the arrangements in the palace in spring, using the first day of the lunar month as usual."</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival entry: "The palace has moon-viewing and osmanthus arrangements this evening."</p>
<p>Double Ninth Festival entry: "The palace usually makes arrangements for the Double Ninth Festival on the eighth day."</p>
<p>Opening Furnace entry: "On this day, the Emperor offers sandwiched clothing in front of the palace...until the first day of February next year, the Queen's palace opens the furnace for arrangements..."</p>
<p>Winter Solstice entry: "Great court meetings and celebrations for the Winter Solstice arrangements."</p>
<p>The meaning of "arrangement" in the above entries seems to be an abbreviation of "arranging the scene" as today's people say. The so-called "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival Arrangement" is the "arrangement" during the "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival." Music must be played during the "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival Arrangement," and there is a certain order for playing music, which is the basis for the creation of "order of music." "Arrangement" and "order of music" clearly refer to two different things, and "order of music" is just one item in "arrangement." Grammatically speaking, the easiest mistake to find when linking "arrangement" and "order of music" is that there is no subject before "Arranging the Order of Music." Because this subject is too important: without "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival" as the subject, or using other subjects, it has not been seen in "Old Events in Wulin." According to the common practice in "Old Events in Wulin," the word "arrangement" should be affixed after "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival," and "order of music" is an additional explanation of another matter and should not be linked with "arrangement" to become a proper noun.</p>
<p>Since "Arranging the Order of Music" cannot be regarded as a proper noun, what is the basis for Mr. Lu's statement that it is the origin of "drama lists"? I have said in the previous article that "order of music" is the order of playing glory. Mr. Lu probably said this based on this point. "Old Events in Wulin" does not specify the usage of "order of music." However, judging from the styles seen in the old events today, it is different from today's "drama lists."</p>
<p>Xuan Nan Ling Meng Lu:</p>
<p>"At that time, the drama lists of each garden were printed on yellow paper about two inches long and one inch high. Before this list was sent, the best dramas selected from the day's drama list in the garden were presented to the officials on red list sheets, and each official passed them around for viewing. Those who wished to watch them first were rewarded with ten or twenty coins after reading."</p>
<p>Meng Hua Suo Bu:</p>
<p>"Three-inch red note narrow drama list. According to today's drama garden, there is no drama list. The actors or write on a piece of paper and put it in their sleeves for acquaintances to consult. Only the hall party still uses red paper drama list."</p>
<p>Chapter 5 of "Appreciating Flowers and Identifying Treasures": "...Seeing the follower of Pin Cai walk to Pin Cai's side and say: Mr. Ye sent the drama list. Zi Yu came over and looked at it with Pin Cai. Seeing the first few dramas were Sweeping Flowers, Three Drunkennesses, Discussing Swords, and Visiting Teachers..."</p>
<p>The records about drama lists are scattered in various notes and novels, and there should be more than this. However, records with the same meaning as the "drama list" mentioned by Mr. Lu are not common.</p>
<p>"Curtain list" plays a role in civilization dramas similar to the string used to string money in ancient times. The main programs of a play are written on the list, and the actors follow this list. When the last program listed on the list is finished, the play is considered finished. This was a product of a transitional era in the early Chinese drama movement when there were no scripts. In terms of its nature, form, and purpose, it has nothing to do with "Arranging the Order of Music." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Strange Theories</h3>
<p>— Ti Zhai</p>
<p>Throughout history, there have been two schools of thought. One is dedicated to factual evidence, not allowing for even half a false statement. The other leans towards speculation, freely ranging from near to far, from A to B. The former belongs to induction, while the latter might be勉强be considered deduction. There have always been many absurd stories in ancient times, such as "The Tale of King Mu," "Classic of Mountains and Seas," "Li Sao," and "Heavenly Questions." Their meaning leans towards speculation or imagination, with both truth and falsehood. Sima Qian had a relatively scientific mind and felt that before the Yellow Emperor, without evidence, there was no belief. He resolutely cut out several legendary eras. One cannot say that his vision was not far-sighted. However, the Grand Historian wasn't as rigid as Western scientists, opening both big and small doors for both big and small cats. Therefore, his writing is still full of novelistic and legendary depictions, so as not to bore us, thus becoming an eternal masterpiece.</p>
<p>People in the Qing Dynasty were threatened by literary inquisitions and other things, so they had to delve into old papers, and they absolutely did not dare to express different opinions. Evidential historical research became very popular. Even so, they did not dare to go beyond the circle of their predecessors to be suspicious, so they were slaves to the ancients. It was not until the Changzhou School used Gongyang philosophy as a theory that it brought out Kang Youwei's skeptical school, laying the foundation for modern new historiography. The articles of the seven or eight large volumes of "Debates on Ancient History" are actually all from the same school.</p>
<p>Skepticism is indeed good, because of it there is investigation and verification. The interpretation and application of oracle bones and bronze inscriptions have completely changed the appearance of ancient history. In addition, the import of new social sciences has allowed people three thousand years later to have a further understanding of three thousand years ago. Although elders like Zhang Taiyan and Lü Chengzhi did not believe in these things, it was ultimately ineffective.</p>
<p>However, there are also problems, which are the creation of various baseless strange theories, arbitrarily speaking, regardless of facts, and without looking for evidence, "only wanting to hear strange things." I think this is also not good. Slowly, it may completely plunge evidential historical research into the quagmire of fantasy, which will get further and further away from the pursuit of truth in scholarship.</p>
<p>For example, someone regards Mo Di as an Indian, completely developing it from the character "Mo." I feel that it is too involved in imagination and has long been criticized. Unexpectedly, recently reading the "New China Magazine," there is another claim that An Lushan is a transliteration of Alexander. The reason is nothing more than that the English spelling of An's name starts with A, as does Alexander, and Alexander the Great's military power once reached Asia, and Lushan was a foreign barbarian, etc. Such verification, how can it not be ridiculous? And a serious academic publication randomly publishes such things that are not established, which is also a bit of a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Checking the household registration book of the tenth year of the Tianbao era discovered in Dunhuang, there are many foreign surnames, and many belong to the Western Regions or Persia. Names that are similar in sound to An Lushan include "Alehushan" and "Gayingshan." Therefore, the Japanese historian Kuwabara Jitsuzo suspected that the An family was Persian, but still did not dare to conclude that it was Alexander, because the sound of "Alehushan" is ultimately different from the arrangement of Alexander. The author of the previous article did not even see this point, and has such a rash arrogance, which is probably similar to saying that Mo Di was a red-headed Ah San, which is really not worth learning from. I feel that the spirit of the Chinese people has always been to seek truth from facts, but in recent times, it has turned the other way. Everything does not start from a little bit, but focuses on startling the world and establishing differences in order to attract attention. This trend is very worrying! Maybe this is the "Shanghai style"?</p>
<h3>Feelings on a Rainy Day</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I can't recall which book it was, but a certain foreigner said something along the lines of: "The most useful things in the world are not necessarily the most valuable, and the most valuable things are not necessarily the most useful. For example, diamonds and water. The former has little practical use, yet its price is surprisingly high. The latter is indispensable to humans, second only to air, yet it is extremely cheap." This statement is very true. It's not just diamonds and water, but also the difference between people. There are plenty of people in the world who are utterly useless, yet they wear silk and satin, eat delicacies from land and sea, and are driven around in imported cars, damaging the roads and even killing pigs and dogs that are more useful than them. Conversely, those who toil their entire lives, shedding blood and sweat for the benefit of the people, end up poorly clothed and underfed.</p>
<p>Getting back to the point, although water is not as valuable as diamonds by a factor of billions, to the poor commoners who don't even know what diamonds are, in cities like Shanghai that have waterworks, water is almost a luxury. The flush toilet in my house has been broken for a long time, and the cost of repairing it is very high, so we haven't been able to flush it. The family has to carry water to flush it, but my mother strictly forbids wasting clean water, only allowing us to use the leftover dirty water after washing our faces, clothes, rice, and vegetables. Sometimes, I or the children forget her instructions and turn on the tap in preparation, and as soon as she sees it, she will exclaim sternly, "Amitabha! The water bill was so high last month, and you still don't know how to save a little!" Not only that, but our water tap is a bit loose, and we have to tighten it forcefully when turning it off to prevent it from dripping. This worries her immensely, even more than my concern for national affairs. Every night before going to bed, she makes sure to tighten it forcefully, and sometimes she suddenly gets up in the middle of the night, asking what's wrong. She says she heard the sound of the tap dripping, but there's really no such thing. It can be seen that water is of no small value to my mother, and if this continues, I'm truly worried that her nerves will give way.</p>
<p>Is this just a matter for my family? If so, that would be fine. But in fact, there are probably countless families on the Shanghai Bund who are concerned about the cost of tap water. Therefore, I often wonder. Water is a gift from heaven, something indispensable to human life. Heaven bestows it upon people, so why do we have to pay money to get it? For technique, for convenience, I support tap water. If water is to come by itself, factories must be built, machines purchased, and water pipes installed, etc. This is what is called cost and investment, of course, charging fees is necessary to maintain the business and make a profit. But water itself ultimately comes from the sky, requiring no manual labor. Compared to roads, it doesn't require opening and construction, nor does it need to be paved with asphalt or wood blocks, of course, saving much money and effort. The need for water is millions of times more important than the need to walk on asphalt roads, so why do city governments around the world know to allocate funds for building and repairing roads, and do not set a price, charging people a few dollars and cents for walking a mile, but are unwilling to establish waterworks, making people pay for water, and pay a considerable amount?</p>
<p>Therefore, I often lament that the so-called civilization and progress of the world, and the efforts of governments to seek happiness for the people, are all empty words, not worth mentioning. Whether the world is truly civilized or not, and whether governments are truly seeking welfare for the people, I want to determine by whether humans have to pay for drinking water that falls from the sky. In Victor Hugo's novel "Les Misérables," there is a line that says: "God gives light to men, and the law sells it for money." In France at that time, there was a limit to how many windows a family could have, and a fee had to be paid for exceeding the limit. Now, 85 years have passed since the publication of "Les Misérables," but governments around the world still allow giant merchants and wealthy businessmen to sell water bestowed upon humans by heaven for profit. It can be seen that the world is still...</p>
<p>Today, heavy rain is falling, and I am awake late at night, listening to the sound of rain outside the window, imagining the streets filled with water channels and the Huangpu River rising several inches. Then, I think of my mother, who might be worried about the tap water bill even in her sleep, waking up and checking if the tap is tightly closed, regardless of the risk of catching a cold. I deeply feel that the absurdity and contradictions of the world are truly unbelievable.</p>
<h3>Humor</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>In the History of the Song Dynasty, Mi Yuanzhang was the prefect of Wuwei Army. There was a huge rock in the state, with a strange and ugly shape. Yuanzhang saw it and was overjoyed, saying, "This is enough to receive my worship." He put on his official attire and bowed to it, calling it "elder brother." Such was his humor. Recently, I saw in "Miscellaneous Notes from the Willow South Studio" that "Wu Li, whose courtesy name was Yushan, was from Changshu. He lived in a place called Inkwell, so he called himself the Daoist of Inkwell. He was skilled in poetry and painting, and also proficient in calligraphy, capturing the style of Su Shi. He once traveled to Wuxing and visited its prefect. He was not immediately received upon entering, so he strolled to a monk's abode and saw Su Shi's authentic work, 'Ode to the Drunken Old Man.' He was so delighted that he rented the place and set up his mat there, unrolling the scroll and copying it for three or four days without fatigue. The prefect sent people to search everywhere for the Daoist of Inkwell, but there was no one. The innkeepers also did not know where he had gone. After finishing the copying, he was happily satisfied and left without seeing the prefect. Such was his noble demeanor." This is similar to Cai Shangshu entering the Hongdu Temple stele and not returning for ten days, sharing the same kind of humor, so I have recorded them together.</p>
<h3>On Human Nature and Worldly Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>As long as someone is human, they have their own experiences of social life. Once these life experiences are formalized, they become what is known as human nature and worldly wisdom. Therefore, as long as someone is human, they more or less understand some human nature and worldly wisdom.</p>
<p>Life experiences are valuable life lessons, and human nature and worldly wisdom are the accumulation of these lessons, so naturally they are worthy of cherishing. However, anything that comes from progress will turn into a stumbling block when it can no longer be used for further progress. Human nature and worldly wisdom are like that.</p>
<p>Everyone recognizes that the current social atmosphere is too bad. Corruption, speculation, fraud, and other similar things that show the decline of social morality fill the pages of newspapers almost every day. Laws cannot prevent problems before they happen, and punishments can only serve as a warning after the fact. I remember that not long before the victory, a newspaper published an article titled "Don't Let People's Hearts Open the Floodgates." At that time, it had already sensed that such a serious social problem might come. And now, it is not just opening the floodgates, but more like the dike has burst.</p>
<p>The individual reasons for the problem are naturally extremely complex. For example, from the perspective of corruption, many people believe that it is caused by the fact that the salaries of civil servants are not enough to support their integrity. This is indeed true. But there is an even more important reason, and that is the psychology created by being full of worldly wisdom. Many people think that in this era, it is foolish not to make "extra money" when doing things. If you don't make it, someone else will. Since the situation is like this, why should I be the only fool?</p>
<p>When friends meet, and they talk about each other's life situation, they always have to ask whether you have any other "income" besides your regular income. The person being asked may not necessarily give a positive answer, but they understand each other with a smile. The more ways you have to make money, the less others will look down on you, and they will secretly admire your "ability." Seeing someone wearing a brand new suit and shiny leather shoes recently, even though they know that the person's normal income cannot be like this, they will always compliment, "Brother, you really have a way." Moreover, nine out of ten of these compliments are not hypocritical politeness, but genuine admiration from the bottom of their hearts. The person being complimented is also complacent, thinking it is natural. This is because they all understand this set of human nature and worldly wisdom.</p>
<p>Many things that are originally sinful will be regarded as normal by everyone as long as they are explained through human nature and worldly wisdom. For example, "skimming" is originally an improper behavior, but now it has long been considered a natural atmosphere by everyone. Not skimming has become abnormal! The nanny skimming when buying groceries, the housewife thinks it is natural, even if there is a "honest" nanny, in the eyes of the owner, she is still inevitably in the category of skimming. Because the owner has this kind of psychology, what does the nanny rely on if she doesn't rely on extra money?</p>
<p>Going a step further, what is the psychological motivation for bribery and corruption? There is such a kind of psychological understanding between the briber and the bribee. The psychology of the briber is: "He is the person who is doing this kind of job. If I don't drop a few small coppers on him, I will be troubled by him. Forget it, these few dollars can't be saved anyway." And the psychology of the bribee is: "What am I doing? If I don't take his money, someone else will take it. Since he is sensible, I am also happy to. Besides, the emperor does not send hungry soldiers, how can I live on this little dead salary? Convenience for others, convenience for myself. So-and-so is doing this, why should I be insensible!"</p>
<p>"Sensible" is a key to being deeply versed in human nature and worldly wisdom. The so-called knowing the tricks of the trade will not suffer losses. Otherwise, you will inevitably be scolded as a "fool."</p>
<p>What a terrible human nature and worldly wisdom! But it is precisely the general atmosphere of today's urban society, and the general psychology of society. If you don't understand these things, you are bound to be a failure in this society.</p>
<p>I am not a moralist, but I am afraid that our nation that understands human nature and worldly wisdom will fall into an unrecoverable abyss because of this—experience is what we need, but what we need more today is new life, new blood. Those who are referred to as fools and idiots, you are blessed, Amen!</p>
<h3>Born on the Fifth Day of the Fifth Month</h3>
<p>— Gan Jing</p>
<p>The brief biography of Wang Zhen'e in the History of the Southern Dynasties says: "Zhen'e was the grandson of Wang Meng, and was born on the fifth day of the fifth month. Meng thought it strange and said: 'In the past, Mengchang Jun was born on an unlucky day but became the prime minister of Qi. Will this child also prosper my family?' So he named him Zhen'e," etc. It can be seen that being born on the fifth day of the fifth month was tabooed by the customs of the time. However, in addition to Mengchang Jun and Wang Zhen'e, according to the Miscellaneous Records of Leng Lu, there were also Hu Guang (Hu Guang of the Han Dynasty, not Hu Guang of the Song Dynasty), Zhang Fei, Wang Feng, Emperor Gao Wei of Northern Qi, Wang Chuo of Nanyang in Northern Qi, Cui Xinming, Emperor Huizong of Song, Weng Yinglong, Ji Guo, Empress Yide of Liao, Zhao Yuanhao, etc., whose experiences were all different. What is strange is that Tian Texiu was born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and his nickname was Wu'er (Fifth Child). The name of the village he lived in was "Half Ten," and he was the fifth child in his family. At the age of twenty-five, he ranked fifth in the four imperial examinations in the village and prefecture. He died on the fifteenth day of the eighth month at the age of fifty-five (see History of Jin).</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Two Hearts in Harmony</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai repeatedly said thank you, took it, and suddenly felt a burst of fragrance hit his nose. He folded it carefully, put it in his pocket, and helped Qi Wan walk down the Pinghe. The two of them stepped out of the garden in the moonlight. Zhu Zhai wanted to hire a car, but Qi Wan said, "No need, the moonlight is very good today, and there's no one at night, let's just take a walk." She then reached out and put her arm on Zhu Zhai's arm. The two of them walked slowly, fortunately not encountering any acquaintances along the way. Qi Wan kept asking Zhu Zhai about her parents' temperaments, living situation, how many years he had been working at the bank, and what good friends he had outside. As they talked, they unknowingly walked out of Xuanwumen and reached Xiaochang Hutong, not far from Qi Wan's home. Suddenly, a black car drove into the alley. Qi Wan was quick-witted and quickly pulled Zhu Zhai to the side of the road to let the car pass. Qi Wan then shook Zhu Zhai's hand and said, "I'm almost home, you don't need to see me off, see you tomorrow." After saying that, she hurriedly walked forward. Zhu Zhai was talking intimately with Qi Wan all the way, and was in the midst of enthusiastic agitation, when Qi Wan suddenly stopped him like this. He stood there stunned. Watching Qi Wan busy walking forward, he felt lost! He stood foolishly under the locust tree by the side of the road, seeing that the black car had stopped in front of Qi Wan's two green doors. The red light behind the car flashed, reversing the car for more than ten steps, turning the car body, turning the front of the car, and the two car lights in front shone out with a light of several feet, shining right under the old locust tree. Zhu Zhai was shaken back to his senses by the light in front of him, feeling that standing here was too meaningless. He sighed slightly, and walked slowly with lazy steps and lowered his head, feeling only annoyed and touched. When he reached the entrance of the alley, he was about to hire a car when the horn suddenly sounded, and the black car swept past him, only a few inches away. Zhu Zhai was almost hit by the car, and was startled, quickly dodging. In this glance, he suddenly saw Qi Wan and a man in the car, and his nerves trembled again! Under this shock, hate and jealousy suddenly arose in his heart. He thought that Qi Wan was an innocent girl, how could she be close to these people! Her family education is very strict, why did her family let her do it! Immediately, jealousy turned into doubt, wanting to find out and resolve this question. Thinking this way, he immediately changed his mind, not wanting to go back. He thought to himself that the little Wang Ma in her house seemed to be very talkative. Asking her might reveal the truth, so he re-entered the alley and went to Qi Wan's door. He squatted down, grabbed some loose soil on the ground, and brushed it on his sleeves and trouser legs, then pressed the doorbell several times in a row. Little Wang Ma opened half a door and looked out, saw that it was Zhu Zhai, and quickly smiled, "Mr. Xu is here, the boss is not at home." Zhu Zhai pretended to be very embarrassed and said, "I'm really unlucky! I was hit by a car and almost died!" When Little Wang Ma heard this, she immediately opened both doors. The electric light inside the door shone on Zhu Qi's body. Sure enough, he was covered in dust, as if he had fallen on the street and just crawled up. She asked in surprise, "Hit by a car, are you injured? Please come in quickly." As she spoke, she made way, standing beside the door, letting Zhu Zhai walk in with a limp. (End of this chapter).</p>
<h3>Contributor's Remarks</h3>
<p>— Luota</p>
<p>"Life is like a mayfly" is an overstatement; "articles are like mayflies" is an undeniable fact. Mayflies live for a day, and articles in newspapers last from the time they come out of the rolling machine to the time they are used to wrap fried dough sticks, a total of only five or six hours. Morning newspapers don't know about branches, and evening newspapers don't last until morning. How much "spiritual" expenditure is there in a day and night! One night, passing by the Baxianqiao vegetable market, I saw truckloads of bloody cattle and sheep transported from the slaughterhouse, and I couldn't help but feel the same pity for my own and others' hard work.</p>
<p>If selling smiles is the most despicable profession, then selling articles must be the most foolish profession. An intellectual has exhausted all kinds of ways to make money before resorting to this last resort. Take pulling rickshaws, for example. Passengers still negotiate the price before daring to get on. What about you? You let people give you whatever they want after you arrive at your destination. Last year, I wrote an article for a newspaper, and the first half of the month, 3,000 words earned 30,000 yuan. The second half of the month, 6,000 words, I thought I could get 60,000 yuan this time, but the newspaper lost money, and I only received 15,000 yuan. I remember that in elementary school math class, I never understood what was called "inverse proportion." One day, the teacher asked me a question: If one person can finish a job in two days, how about two people? I replied, "Four days," and the whole class laughed. Now I have finally "experienced" it once. I am prepared. This may be even more ridiculous, but I have to swallow my tears.</p>
<h3>Duck</h3>
<p>— Xu Tonghua</p>
<p>Today, the author returned from the office, and the sky was already dusk. Wang Ma moved a bowl of well-cooked duck and placed it squarely in the center of the table. According to my wife, winter is the season for tonic nourishment, which made me think of an old story about ducks.</p>
<p>That year, in late autumn, my wife came out of her hometown, S city, bringing a fat duck, saying that it was specially given to me by one of her fellow villagers. This duck had been raised for five or six years. According to popular explanations, its nourishing properties were particularly high. Therefore, my wife happily brought it out, preparing to let me finish the whole duck in two days when the weather turned cool. My wife insisted on not letting anyone else share a taste, otherwise, the nourishing properties would be diminished. There was some superstitious element involved.</p>
<p>In the following days, the weather remained hot. The duck was raised in the courtyard in front of the house. I had gone downstairs to see it a few times. In my memory, it was a pitiful little animal. Flapping its wings, walking wobbly, bulging its round eyes, not saying whether it was a sad or happy expression. However, it may have suffered from the so-called "acclimatization" problem, and its body became increasingly thin.</p>
<p>After that, one day, it was slightly chilly. My wife, seeing that the duck's weight had decreased, felt that she could no longer wait. That night, when I came home, the table was, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, also filled with a bowl of duck soup, but this time, it was cooked more elaborately with fennel and other seasonings.</p>
<p>When I was eating the duck, my wife smiled and said to me that something very unexpected happened today. I asked her what it was. She said she would tell me after I finished eating. So, I finished this large bowl of duck. There were still two large bowls in the pot, ready to be eaten by me in two installments tomorrow.</p>
<p>After dinner, my wife told me what happened.</p>
<p>At that time, I did not yet employ Wang Ma in my house. The former maid did not know how to kill ducks. My wife specially invited a clerk from the rice store next door and asked him if he knew how to kill ducks. He said, "Yes, yes." He picked up the duck and went out, gave it a blow to the head with a knife, threw it on the ground, and left on his own accord.</p>
<p>The maid placed the killed duck in an open bucket and poured hot water into it. Who knew that its throat had not been severed. When the hot water rushed in, it came back to life, tilted its head, and ran out of the back door, straight into the rice store next door.</p>
<p>The rice store clerk stared at it blankly, as if the duck was "demanding its life" from him. He repeatedly said, "I didn't eat it, it has nothing to do with me." In an instant, the duck dove into the pit in the rice store, and it was difficult to catch it again.</p>
<p>At this moment, the maid placed the duck alive in the bucket and scalded it to death with hot water. When plucking the duck feathers, there were many fine feathers, and it took her almost an hour to pluck them all. My wife was afraid that I would lose my appetite after hearing this, so she waited until I had finished a large bowl before telling me.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to the residence of a senior elder in my wife's family on Tongfu Road for some business. Before leaving, my wife repeatedly urged me to come back and finish the leftover duck soup. That day, it happened that the host was hosting a banquet, and I had not visited for a long time, so they insisted on keeping me for dinner. I still remember very clearly that there was a Mr. C at the table, the former general manager of a certain bank and the current broker of the Securities Exchange, as well as a Mr. K, an industrialist from the inland.</p>
<p>At first, I made up my mind to taste each dish slightly and then stop, so that I could wait to go home and eat the duck. However, the host was so diligent that whenever he saw me stopping after a shallow taste, he would pile the dishes into my small plate. The dishes that day were not only well-cooked, but also very sumptuous. My defense line finally completely collapsed. After drinking five or six cups of wine and eating two bowls of rice lightly, when I stood up, I suddenly felt an excessive sense of being drunk and full. When I went back that day, it was already nine o'clock. My wife was guarding the bowl of duck, waiting for me. With some apology, I refused her kindness, as there was really no room for more. I had to eat it the next day.</p>
<p>However, the next day, the weather suddenly turned hot. By noon, the duck had already gone bad. A pungent, spoiled sour smell filled the air, so it had to be poured into the trash can outside the door.</p>
<p>I watched my wife come in with the empty bowl, and I suddenly felt a different kind of feeling: this duck had been painstakingly raised for five or six years, brought to Shanghai from afar, and it took so much effort to kill it. How much my wife hoped that I could finish it all by myself, but in the end, the leftovers were still poured away! A sense of melancholy swept through my heart. These two days, I have been reading Hemingway's collection of novels for the second time, and the words are filled with a faint sadness. I thought of the old story, as if I had become a character in this foreign novelist's pen.</p>
