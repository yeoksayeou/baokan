<p>〔本報徐州九日電〕魯南大殲滅戰已捐開序幕，溯沂河北上國軍，八日下午收復沂水，不僅已將回竄雲蒙山區共匪與諸城之後方補給綫完全切斷，且又使竄靑駝寺，垛莊，費縣，界河地區之共匪十二萬主力已完全陷入國軍沂水，臨沂，泗水蒙陰，東里店之袋形包園圈內，此實為國軍殲滅共匪華東野戰軍主力一難得易失之良機。在戰略上，國軍已先居絕對優勢地位，又共匪主力集結於狹小山區，飲水食糧均極困難，此亦足致共匪之死命。</p>
<p>〔本報臨沂九日電〕沂蒙山區南麓戰事激烈，有增無已。流竄靑駝寺，湯頭鎭之共軍四個縱隊，經國軍四晝夜包圍激戰，續被殲滅二萬餘人。另圍攻費縣之共軍，增至三個縱隊，雖於七日晚進入城垣，但已陷入國軍之反包圍，正鏖戰中。</p>

<p>〔本報兗州九日電〕魯西戰事已趨穩定，竄擾荷澤之劉伯誠部，因國軍增援部隊適時到達，已將其南竄遮斷隴海路之企圖全部粉碎，共軍以南竄來遂，乃轉以主力北上繞越汶上，向寗陽外圍竄擾。同時，由吐絲口向西流竄之陳毅部第八縱隊，七日陷中宮後，亦向泰安城攻擊，該城國軍為取得主動，七日夜已自動將城垣放棄。另原據淄博之陳毅部第三·十兩個縱隊及黃河北岸共軍，亦向明水·普集·晏城一帶攻擾，國軍為機動作戰，八日早自動轉進至龍山·界首·肥城·古陽·齊河·桑　店之綫。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州九日電〕共匪劉伯誠部第六縱隊一部五千餘人，七日猛犯清澤，守章奮勇反擊，八日晨已被擊退，嘉祥·鉅野間，七日夜竄到共匪二·三兩縱隊約兩萬人，國軍阻擊，正激戰中。曹縣七日夜被匪千餘攻陷。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕張院長以各國家銀行職員待遇，較公敎人員高出多少，殊欠公允，令四聯總處召集各有關機關商討如何縮减。該處九日午曾召集會議，對此詳加研討。</p>
<h3>北塔山事件尚未解決　蒙受軍又不斷侵擾　迭犯白楊溝均被我擊退</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化八日電〕奇台訊：北塔山事件，自經我外交部向外蒙提出嚴重抗議後，我軍除確保陣地外，即望此事能循外交途徑解決，然月餘以來，　軍除在事件發生之初期，因世界與論之指責而略退避外，現仍不時向我侵擾，以牽制我在新國軍之行動，其目的顯合有廣泛之政治意義。六月廿六日晚九時許，外蒙騎兵三百餘人，在胡芝爾特（北塔山北麓）以南向我烏斯滿部隊進攻，激戰至廿七日午，始不支敗退。廿八日下午三時，有雙翼戰鬥機一架，飛至我陣地上空偵察，並以機槍掃射。七月三日拂曉，蒙騎三百餘，復向我白楊溝（北塔山北麗）進攻，經激戰後，於午後二時向白楊溝正面之東南方面敗退，當激戰時，之有輕重轟炸機各一架飛臨助戰，投彈多枚，並低空掃射，我該地後方之遊牧民衆人畜，均有相雷死傷。四日晨九時，蒙軍復向白楊溝我軍陣地進攻，經一晝夜之爭鬥，戰况異常激烈，迄五日晨十時，始不支敗退。此間軍民情緒至為憤慨，亟盼政府再向外蒙作最後一次之抗議，以制止此連續無恥之行為，並返還侵佔我國之所有土地，否則應採取有效措施，將蒙軍全部逐出我國領土外，按蒙軍已侵入新疆六百華星以上，布爾根察罕通古等地，去年即已先後為其侵侵佔。</p>
<h3>莫斯圖電臺廣播　否認蘇軍佔塔城</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕中國婦女團體聯誼會，九日上午九時舉行理事會，到各團體代表沈懸蓮。唐國楨。呂曉道。黎劍虹等廿餘人，議決要案如下：（一）對於政府發布戡亂動員令，通電全國婦女一致響應。（二）對於立法院最近通過全國性婦女團體所佔國大代表名額一案，表示抗議，其規定「全國性婦女團體佔代表名額為二十名，並限制須設立五分會方為合格」為不合理，且不合法。關於後者，除定期招待新聞記者，請予與論上之協助外，並推定代表分途向中央黨部，國民政府，立法院，社會部請願。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國民政府令：（一）茲制定職業團體選　出之立法委員名額分配表公布之，此令。（二）茲制定國民大會婦女團體代表名額分配表，公布之，此令。</p>

<h3>美眾議員楚德　籲請援助中國　稱讚主席具遠大眼光</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕美衆議員楚德，本日於接見記者時，敦促美國應立即對華作更大之援助。楚氏評論蔣至席七月六日之廣播日；『蔣主　吿國人稱「如不舉國一致戡亂，整個國家將被斷送」，此語在未來歷史上，將可證明其正確。」楚氏稱讀蔣主席具有遠大眼光。渠久在其他國家瞭悟之。前即已洞察日本軍事侵略之野心，一如渠今日洞察共產黨之禍患者然。蔣主席對任何國家，從不予以姑息，渠在最初，即已反對日本之侵略，蔣主席曾力圖與共產黨取得政治解決，然後者使之不能實現，故蔣主席現已別無選擇，其最後策略唯有與共產黨作戰到底，而渠對所遭遇之一切困難，固非不知也。楚氏批評美國及其他盟國，拋棄中國於危急之中，並曰：「蔣主席必須起而抵抗對罪惡之侵襲，一如渠在一九三七年曾起而抵抗日本。」楚氏稱：「美國之對華政策，眼光甚為淺短，美國與共產主義因循周旋，甚至促使其形成。渠曰美國應立即予中國以援助，况中國在大戰中曾為美國之盟友，且無疑曾拯救十萬美國士兵之生命乎？</p>
<h3>第三次大戰危機　遠東較歐洲嚴重　浦蘭特爵士演器</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦九日電〕浦蘭特爵士昨晚在海外大厦對大批聽衆演講「中國現狀」時，曾發表預測性之棄童見，謂第三次大戰之爆乏，在遠東較在歐洲有更嚴重之危險，當其批評雅爾達決議案有關中國之東北時稱：「在過去一百年間，東北為日俄角逐之所，且丙國間最後勝負之判明為不可免。現日本業已戰敗，蘇俄在遠東正與美國相持」。浦蘭特餘士盛讚中國文化，彼名之為歷史上最大成州就之一。其他建立於武力上之帝國，崛起後結果仍遭崩潰，但中國仍存。今日此一古老政體，業已成過去，中國現正為覓得一新政體而奮鬥。在此以村落為共和政體單位之國家中，建立集權政府之實騐並未成功。浦爵士更云：「余甚嘉愛中國人，余且為中國文化之崇舟者，佘愛中國人帶愛其缺點，惟認視中國人之缺點對其實有害無益」。在其被詢問中國語言是否為中國統一過程中之一種阻碍時，彼答稱：事實與所間適相反。中國文字為使中國團結之一因素，中文雖外人學習時困難，但其自身較其他字母拼之文字更美麗，更能表達意思，且更可運用自由。答覆另一問題時，浦爵士稱：中國經濟狀况確贊很糟，戰事以來極少工業化計劃，且與戰前比較，其目前出口事業範圍非常小，但中國剛受到種非常之經騐，彼深信中國並未失去其挽回局面之能力。</p>
<h3>監院明開臨時會　討論配合動員工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕總動員案公在後，監院正作各種進備，以加强為配合募員而作之監察工作。監院定　　日晨舉行臨時會，或將討論此事。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕記者於八日遇于院長右任於外部公祭楊光性典禮中，當詢以對於此次總動員案之進行如何？于氏當指出，自抗戰勝利以還，以中共劃攄與　擾，而使勝利成果為之削減，建設無法進行，民生陷於極度之痛苦與恐慌。事至今日，非掃除一切和平建設之障礙，克服一切環境之困難不可，藝和平民主與統一不可分，無統一則殆無民主和平之可言，希望全國上下，懸此鵠的以共赴。</p>
<p>〔又電〕全國各地對政府總動員戡平匪亂，實施憲政之號召，普遍表示擁獲。八日電政府表示擁護看，續有台省參議會，蓉西川郵務公會，川自責市訊者公會，長春市臨參會，桂省參議會，商聯會，豫南陽縣參議會，晋省臨參會，寗夏參議會，及各民衆團體。又台省各界八日公祭抗戰陣亡將士曁死難同胞大會，特捐國幣一億元，電匯國防部，請代為慰勞前方將士。</p>
<p>〔中央社迪化九日電〕奇合電話，此間軍民獲悉中央已頒布總動員令，極為振奮，僉認戡亂禦侮，此其時矣，並以此項消息，迅速通知北塔山守軍。</p>
<h3>陜北淳化等縣　甕形地帶清野　實施併村移民計劃</h3>

<h3>新聞局在古　設立辦事處</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕行政院新聞局在平成立辦事處，地點已定東交民巷舊德國使館。此辦事處預定由國際宣傳處華北辦事處改組，組織規程及經費預算正擬訂中。</p>
<h3>政協成歷史名詞　其秘書處組織宣布結束</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕聯合各黨派以共商國是而成立之機構「政協」，現已無存在之必要，故政協之名稱及其秘處之組織頃經正式宣布結束。據聞：此種決定，乃以政協成立以來所獲各項協議及決定，均經共黨拒絕，而政府對制憲及召開國大均能按照實施，共黨撕毀政協決議，拒絕和談，政府於不得已之情形下，實行全國總動員，且各黨派凡可參加政府者，均已參加，在此總動員令頒布後，政府態度業已明朗，政協自已已無所作用，故決予結束。</p>

<h3>總動員辦法研究中　檢查制度未聞恢復　董顯光局長簽復記者問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕行政院新聞局九日下午四時半在該局舉行記者招待會，董顯光局長答覆記者詢問如下</p>
<p>問，總動員是否表示政府將利用私人有儲國外之資財？</p>
<p>問，中央各部會或各省政府是否將因總動員而有所變更？</p>
<p>答，總動員實施辦法，尙在政府研究之中。在制定之前，本人對於其中細節，無法奉吿。</p>
<p>問，目前陳儀將軍在何地，並担任何種職位？</p>
<p>答，陳儀將軍現居上海，並未担任政府職位。</p>
<p>問，實施總動員令後，政府將恢復郵電檢查否？</p>
<p>問，外傳中國將實行軍事性及一般性之檢查制度，董局長對此能否作詳盡之解釋，俾明眞相。對於實行檢查制度，是否已有計劃？據新民報稱，此後所有軍事消息，將由中央社集中發布，是否屬實？</p>
<p>答，本人未悉政府有實行一般性或軍事性檢査之計劃。新民報所傳之言，並不確實。</p>
<p>間，最近之軍事情勢如何？</p>
<p>答，上星期內國軍在山東東部收復南麻，東里店，臨朐等共黨叛徒之補給基地。山東南部之共匪，今後若欲自河北或烟台獲得接濟，較前　大為困難，必須遠繞不便之道途。東北方面，自四平街潰敗之共匪，東向西安及西豐撤退，西向遼源撤退，共匪正收拾殘部　準　新攻勢。在河　中部南下之國軍，於五日在荊塘舖興　定守軍會師，荊塘舖在保定東北十五公里，豫北陳賡部下共匪四萬五千人，侵佔博愛及沁陽竄向黃河北岸，企圖呼應劉伯誠魯西之攻勢。</p>

<p>問，關於大連問題，蘇方有覆文到否，或有其他新發展否？</p>
<p>答，關於大迎問題，並無新發展。</p>

<p>出售國營事業　最近辦理情形</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電）關於出售國營事業一事，請顯光局長九日於記者招待會有所報吿。據稱，國營生產事業配售民營辦法中，與經濟部有關者為：（一）中國紡織雞設公司出售全部資產之七成。（二）中華烟草公司全部出售。（三）中國紡織機器製造公司原有官股四成、全部出售。（四）中國蠶絲公司先就股份五成，發行股票，公開出售，其最近辦理情形如下：（一）中紡公司，該公司資產龐大，設備複雜，為愼審處理起見，經聘請各方專家及有關人士，組織估價委會，由經濟部潘前次長序倫，及劉次長泗英，先後兼任主委迄今，已開會五次次，估價工作，在積極進行中。（二）中華烟草公司，該公司所屬之廠，及三倉庫，本年三月底，全部初估價値為六百十四億三千三百餘萬元，其中第一二兩廠，業經核准優先承購，計六十九億六千一百餘萬元，共有捲烟機六十五部，每月可能出產一萬大箱，實際產置，六千大箱，卅五年盈餘四十二億五千餘萬元。（三）中國紡織機製造公司，該公司規定股本總額為六十億，官股四成，以接收之敵偽產業抵充，所接收之產業，為豐田自動車廠·日本機械製作所第五廠，遠東鋼絲布廠，及上海愚園路，峨嵋嵋路兩處房屋。按卅四年十一月中句市價估値，為四十五億七千五百餘萬元，業已超出官股四成之數。最近經蘇浙皖區處理敵偽產業審議委員會重估，為四百四十二億另四百四十七萬餘元。即以此數讓售人民，不必再由該公司轉賬。此辦法已由該會逕報政院核辦。（四）中國蠶絲公司，該公司可供發行股票者，計綢廠三所：絹絲廠一所，全部資產總値為六十三億三千餘萬元，均為接收時之估價，唯應如何依値計價，已請政院指示。此外尙有留供實騐之用，及無盈餘希望之蠶桑塲研究所數單位，已核准優先承講，惟以性質不同，未採發行股票辦法。</p>

<h3>分配日批賠償品　麥帥總部宣布即將開始　請中菲荷印等提出申請</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕麥帥總部今日宣布：日本第一批賠償品即將分給中·菲·荷印·緬甸與馬來，各該國應即提出申請。賠償品包括機械工具，日本前兵工廠中之冶金機器，以及人造橡膠廠設備。此種工廠非日本平時工業所需要。遠東委員會規定第一批賠償為百分之三十，（中國自分之十五，菲百分之五，荷印百分之五，緬甸與馬來合得百分之五。）接受賠償之國家均有代表在此。麥帥並未規定分配日期，大抵將迅速進行。</p>
<p>〔又電〕委帥今日宣佈日本第一批賠償品即將分給中·菲·荷印·緬甸及馬來後，前途荊棘仍多。遠東委員會列人剩餘物資而可用作賠償者計有兵工廠，飛被廠，機械工具，造船萊，鋼鎭廠，電力廠等。委帥此次雖曾提出機械工具與一部份機器，但未言明此等賠償品是否權成第一批即百分之三十內容，且未明言何時方能拆運，對此種種，麥帥總部官員與中·菲·荷印，緬甸及馬來代表均未發表意見。但機械工具乃根據臨時計劃撥充賠償之日本惟一工業剩餘物資。中菲兩國頗願獲得電力廠機器。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京九日電〕據消息靈通方面吿合衆社稱；初步賠償祇包括全部百分之三十臨時賠償計劃中十一或十二部門物資中之二部門。據該方而稱：第一步祇能包括百分之三十之一部，因百分之百之全部淸單尙未完成也。在日本之各國代表團，尙未收到本日公吿中所包括之工廠淸單。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕盟國賠償技術願問委員會今日召開第四次會議，繼續討論賠償之貨幣價値問題，會中反對美國估値辦法之盟國甚多，彼等認為美國之估値「渦高」。同時據悉：分配機械設備約三十萬餘之準備工作，正在進行中，預料三月內，可完成淸單之草定，俟淸單備就後，要求賠償之國家，可能即提出要求，但賠償物品之搬運，或將遲至五六月後。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中·美·英·蘇四國即將舉行第二次抽籤，分配日本驅逐艦及護航驅逐艦九十二艘之剩餘部份。四國海軍代表今晚將赴舞鶴視察六十艘軍艦中選出之「樣子艦」。</p>
<h3>台省接收日財產　一部將抵充賠款</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北八日電〕台省日產處理委員會，今於工作一年零四個月後，頃於最後製成之總報吿書中，列載我國前年收復淪陷半世紀之台灣，共計接收日本財產之總額，為日幣一百五十六億六千五百三十五萬一千八百零八元三角七分。（關於此項統計，本報駐台記者旬前已有報道，載上月廿七日本報）。</p>
<p>日本留置台灣之財產，將來召開對日和會時，將可抵充一部分之日本對華賠款，然信所能抵充之部份，並不甚大。依照行政院之指令，我國所接收之日本留台財產中，僅有一部分財產，可以充作賠償，而非全部分財產皆可充作賠償，例如日人自台胞手中侵佔之土地，日軍留下之軍用品，合灣總督府之房屋，及由我方査獲之若干隱匿日產，均在「非充賠償」之列，因此，對於上述總額中，究有若干司以充作賠償，另有若干不可充作賠償，此兩數字尙須另行核算。</p>
<h3>台商會理事長　談對日貿易　國貨亟應在台歸市場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣商會理事長劉啓光定今（十日）赴京。昨語記者，此行將與經濟部就煤斤之統制與對日貿易有所洽商。以煤斤之統制而論，現行方式不能鼓勵煤商開發新　，台灣　商希望在現有產最外之增產數量，一半准商人自由運銷，以所得之利潤，補貼因統制而蒙受之損失。在新辦法之下，估計一年之內，可增產一百萬噸，此與華中華南之煤荒，裨益極大。關於對日貿易一小，因台省現有工業均為日本所建立，機器之零件非日本製造者不能合用，因此目前工廠停工者不少。對日貿易恢復後，希望能以台省之糖，靈，水果，易進大量之日式機件。又過去台灣素為日貨之獨佔市塲，如今後國貨不能在台灣開闢市塲，則一年之後，台省又將成為日貨之天下無疑。本人曾與上海廿七家國貨廠商晤談，當時建議三點：（一）希望本市工商界人士組織台灣考察團；（二）希望在本年十月廿五日台省光復兩週年紀念時，在台灣舉行一大規模之國貨展覽會；（三）在台灣成立國貨聯營公司之台灣分公司。以上三點，均蒙接受，至感快慰。同時，以台省電力人力之便宜，交通之發達，經濟之安定，實為發展工業之理想地點，故亦希上海之小型工廠，在可能範圍內移至台灣辦理。日本賠償工業物資能多量撥至台灣設廠，上海之大量游資能至台灣鱗買停頓中之日本工廠。能如此，則必能提高合省之工業化，而大有助於國民經濟。台灣自改制以來，政治及經濟已趨於穩定，今後當逐步以求繁榮。</p>
<h3>中荷民航談判　雙方更趨接近　僅一二小節尙待商治</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕中荷民航第四次會談，九日上午在交部舉行，我方代表交部顧問凌士芬，會後語記者稱：此次會議，雙方意見更趨接近，惟有一二小節，尙待商洽，雙方刻成立兩個小組，研討航綫票價以及特種問題</p>
<h3>荷政府付款賠償我被扣留船隻貨物</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡八日電〕荷政府明晨將以馬來幣五十萬元，交中國船主，作為去歲在印尼海上被荷蘭扣押之船隻六艘及貨物之賠償，此將為結束歷時一年之中荷爭端之第一階段。賠償金將由經濟部交各船主，同時荷政府不久將根據相同之基礎，賠償其他船隻。按上月中國船主開會時，決定於荷政府同　亦賠償其他船隻之條件下，接受上述賠償。</p>

<h3>商務團月底赴日　改赴美國說完全不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據赴日商務考察團某團員稱：外傳考察團改赴美國之說，完全不確。盟軍總部方面原望我國商界能產生代表團前往，現外交部已去文有所解釋，代表團之人數亦在商酌之中，預計本月月底當能成行。日本私人貿易下月開放時，我國得有六十四家商行參加，此數已與英帝國數目相等，僅次於美國。我方之困難不外有二：一為交易以美元為標，而我國之美元頭寸缺少；二為我國缺少出口，而若干主要出口品，乃與日本立於競爭地位者。考察團赴日之目的，即在調査彼此能供給之物資。至六十四家商行之名單，當視其營業性質，由主管機關審定，此事尙需時日。關於對日貿易政策，南京方面已屢次開會商討。在中日貿易中，合灣居於重要之地位，因該地出產之糖鹽水果，均為日本所迫切需要者，而台省之樟腦，可以銷往美國。台省工業基礎良好，幣制穩定，我人應使美國工商界有考察台灣之機會，將來美國資本可能參與台省之經濟建設。</p>
<h3>中共拒絕停止軍事行動　黃河復堤益困難　混合委會商談一無結果　水利部日內發表公告說明經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政府·中共·聯總為黃河復堤工作所組之混合委會，七日在東明舉行會議。中共代表王化雲，楊公素，於是日上午十時抵達。會中政府與聯總代表提出中共於六月卅日由　口一帶渡河竄擾，妨害黃河復堤工程，目前實應首先解決軍事一間題。中共代表不予同意，且堅一持就目前旣成事實進行商談，各代表激辯達二小時，迄無結果。一中共代表復提出混合委會之任務，與前聯合委會僅談復堤問題之性質不同，渠等來時，未奉此命令，故需返魯請示後始能續談。至下午六時許，會談即停止，而中共代表即表示必須於八日渡河北返，定下午二時答覆是否繼續開會。旋水利部，國防部，聯總之代表閭振興，葉南，丁致中等，即於八日返汴。又水利部代表曾在會中特別聲明，水利部對黃預期各險工可在七月十日前全部完竣。今中共突渡河擾亂，功虧一簣，如南岸有潰決情事，其責任應由共方負之。</p>

<p>所稱中國復興金融公司，實無異於勸業銀行，即工業投資銀行的性質。其最主要的任務，自在供給工業資金，以便利其發展及融通。所以所需的資本額，相當鉅大，決非其他一般金融機稱可比。這理由是十分簡單的，就是工業資金，必須具有兩個要件，一是利息低，二是期間長；任缺其一，便不足以完成其所負的使命。現在的金融機構，雖覺已有過剩的現象，而工業界仍覺融通困難，資金短絀；四聯總處，儘管承受各式各樣的工貸，其數目動以數十百億計，而工業界資金上的困難，並沒有因此而解除。這就是因為上述這兩個要件，並沒有完全具備之故。</p>
<p>何以這兩個要件，不能完全具備？其原因自然甚多。現在的行局莊庫，單位太多，散則力分，實際上不能供給充分的頭寸，此其一；在名義上，形式上，各機構雖分道掦鎭，各有專司，而事實上，還是商業性質的居多，此其二；一般的利率太高了，工貸的利息，自然連帶提高。不容易的壓得下去。經濟改革方案中，不是明白承認；現在有預扣利息及搜收手續費等不合理的行為嗎？此其三；政府的銀根政策太不國定了，有時相當寬鬆，有時忽然抽緊，其拆息高低的距離，常常會超過一倍以上，使一般金融業和工商業，都不敢放手從事，此其四；因為幣値太不穩定，减少了人民儲蓄的興趣，尤其是長期儲蓄存款，已是絕無僅有，使金融業無從獲得堪以長期貨出的資金行，但專業化尙未澈底做到。又新銀行法對於實業銀行，已規定：對農工鑛及其他生產公用或交通事業的放款，為其主要業務，且限定其所收存款總額應有百分之六十五以上，遝用於實業。但如何陸續調整，以期適合此規定，亦需要相當的時間，此其六。總而言之：各金融機構是否樂於承受這低利和長期的工貸，是一問題；而實際上有無此等充分的能力，又是一問題。因此，這中國復興金融公司的創設，在目前民族工業上看來，確乎是很需要的。</p>
<p>間題是在這公司的鉅額資本，將如何籌集？招募商股，當然是題中應有之義。市塲上的游資，現在如此之多；論理大可乘此吸收一下，以期納入正戰，輔助生產。但游資的目標，恐怕醉翁之意，大都別有所在。照美金債券的勸募成績看來，要單靠商股來作資金，顯然不免近於理想。</p>
<p>其次，則令國家行局分擔一部份，這似乎總可以辦得到的。過去辦理工貸，亦往往由各行局共同承受，現在情勢相同，目標無異，不過化零為整，由另一個固定的團團來專責辦理，諒無不羣策羣力，樂觀厥成的。不過現在四聯共同的力量，還未能應付裕如，滿足工業界當前的需要，則將來換了一個方式，其力量是否便能就此擴大起來，這當然也是一個問題。</p>
<p>又其次為吸收外資，這是一個很合乎理想的要求，只須游理得宜，其可能性也似乎很大。因為這是一個單純的金　機構，也是一個促進生產的健全機構，並不含有任何政治的意味。假如這機構的任務，如原建議人的意思，要擴展到代辦機器，原料·擔保儲款·匯款等事務，我們相化，是有理由可以引起國外投資人的興趣的。</p>
<p>又其次為政府劃撥一部份資金。關於這一點，我們願為政府借箸一籌。其一是日本賠償工廠的處理，據政府非正式的表示，將來要採取價賣的方式。這一筆款項，似乎可以全部或提一部份來撥充，作為復興金融公司的資金。因為從工廠方面換來的錢，仍舊用到扶助工業方面去；可稱名正言順。而且顧名思議，日本的賠償物資，原是賠償公私各方面的損失的。是頃工廠以種種關係，既不便直接拿來賠償各個人的損失，那麼直接拿來充實中國復興金融的資金，間接即所以補充一般民族工業的元氣，這比移用到其他方面去，其意義要深遠得多了。</p>
<p>其二，是移撥各行莊所繳保證進備金。這筆準備金，向來是以但利繳存中央銀行的。新銀行法，改為繳存於中央主管言　所指定之銀行。如經中央主管官署指定，所繳中國復興金融公司，於法本無不合；而日以低利繳存公司，公司仍以低利貸於工業，於情於理，似乎也很允當。上文說過，工業資鑫的難　，除了利息峧低以外，不是在於期間較長嗎？這一點這筆保證準備金，在原繳各銀行，其存戶存額，雖時有變動，而以推陳出新的結果，其應繳的總額；在平常的狀態下，總不會有急劇的變動。故改繳復興公司，作為長期的工業貸款，實際上最為適合。當然，在中央銀行方面的運用看來，這或許是一種損失。但中央銀行來路較寬，不一定需要這筆款子來運用，牠對於各種銀行，本負有調劑與扶助的責任；對於這項證金的全部或部份移動，應可予以支持。</p>
<p>政府對於該公司的資助，自具信心，原不必我們來　舌。不過財政困難，是衆所周知的事實。而土面的兩個辦法，却不須政府多發一張鈔票，也不須另闢一種財源，一轉手之聞，便可為該公司定下基礎，迅速地展開業務起來。如果連同上面其他幾個集資的辦決，同時並進，切實推動，則該公司所需要的炎金，為數雖鉅，還不知所措手，而民族工業當前所　資金融通上的困難，便可以得到一個很大的幫助了。</p>
<p>凡是工業化的國家，對於這一類工業金融原是不可缺的一種組織；其名稱不盡相同，其業務也未必完全一致，可是供給低利和長期的工貸，這一點是大體從同的，他們的實業，所以如此突飛猛進，無疑地，這一類金融機構的輔導與扶助，是一個重大的助力。我國目前困難重重，高利貸的壓迫，尤為工業界的致命傷，所以這個方案很盼望她能迅速成立，尤盼望有關各方面，應用各種可能的方法，儘速予以推進。</p>
<h3>佛朗哥的考驗</h3>
<p>佛朗哥的西班牙最近舉行了一次公民票決，此在實際上，多少即等於我們五權憲法學說中的複決，據美聯社從馬德里傳來的消息，全國人口的百分之八十以上贊成可決了政府所交付表決的元首構承法，絕對信任佛朗哥為元首，並授權佛朗哥指定王室繼承其位。另據路透社傳來消息·是日投票，全國無一處騒動。這眞是佛朗哥的一大考騐。我們似乎不能再說佛朗哥的政權是沒有人民支持的了：全國人口中的百分之八十以上支持了他，這令我們不免有點感想。</p>
<p>佛切哥的西班牙彷彿在國際政治中被褫奪了公權似的，它不是聯合國的會員，也不參加種種國際會議，此皆由國際共產黨的陰謀破壞。蘇聯旣反對佛朗哥的西班牙參加國際政治，戰後各國又多憧憬於一個世界」的好夢，不欲與蘇聯破臉相爭，在此情形之下，佛朗哥的西班牙只有在「光榮的孤立于下謀自已的發殿。然而値得我們注意的是美國政府雖不曾公然予佛朗哥以支持，但美國商業金融方面却對佛朗哥的西班牙時有接濟。而且更値得我們注意的是各地共產黨雖不斷展開反佛朗哥運動，但蘇聯官方不免有時選向佛朗哥頻送秋波。佛朗哥的西班牙是值得我們注意的；再加上了南美的阿根廷及其它承襲西班牙文化的國家如果團結的話，對於世界的持久和平，所關實非淺鮮，我們不能人云亦云，忽視了西班牙！</p>

<h3>美仍盼蘇聯參與　馬歇爾援歐計劃　羅保拒絕出席歐洲會議　瑞典挪威已接受英法政府邀請</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：美國助理國務卿艾瑪今向記者發表談話，表示希望蘇聯重新攷慮其拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃之立塲。據謂；此種計劃參加者愈衆，則收效愈多。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：蘇聯企圖勸阻北歐各國參加歐洲計劃會議，已吿失敗，瑞典及挪威已聲明接受邀請，同時丹麥亦有準備接受之傳說。駐在上述三國之蘇聯大使，僅向三國政府表示意見，謂馬歇爾計劃足以破壞各參加國之主權，但似並無施用外交壓力之企圖。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬尼亞京城九日電〕羅馬尼亞內閣今晨決定拒絕參加歐洲會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社保加利亞京城九日電〕保加利亞部長會議今日議決不參加本月十二日在巴黎舉行之歐洲會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕英法邀請參加巴黎會議以討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之二十二歐洲國家中，除已有十二國同意參加外，今日將續有五國可望決定其答覆，茲誌今日之重要發展如下：游蘭可於今日在華沙正式決定，瑞典·挪威·丹麥三國外長及經濟部長定今日在哥本哈根開會決定共同行動。芬蘭內閣之外交委員會開會贊成不參加，會議後，該國國會將於今日開全體大會作最後决定。瑞士之最後覆艾正由瑞士聯邦議會起草中，預料將附帶保留，接受英法之邀。</p>
<h3>貝文論歐洲合作　盛讚馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃　對移交印度政權一事尤感欣慰</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕具文外相今日在扶綸社之午餐席上致辭，對歐洲局勢表示樂觀，並勸吿歐洲人士，棄絕妨碍合作之一切阻碍。渠力言歐洲需要團結及和諧，對於妨碍合作之歷史性及各族性偏見，務須予以放棄。貝文復曰：對日議和問題令人煞費心機。</p>
<p>於述及印度局勢時認爲政權之移轉與印人，乃英印政治家之偉大勝利，此四萬萬人民之命運，得以討論，理智及協定的方式予以處理，而毋庸假手槍砲，誠令人欣慰不已。英帝國境內並無嚴重之動亂，蓋英國正企圖滿足其人民逐漸增長之要朮。貝文於述及歐洲局勢時，認爲今已有得以經濟　礎處理歐洲問題之愉快象徵，或將爲對於促成歐洲團結之最大貢獻。歐洲需要團結與和諧，其戰時所受創傷至爲巨大，然渠對歐洲之前途仍表樂觀，第望歐洲人民對於妨碍合作之歷史性或種族性偏見，得予棄絕。渠覺在今日之環境，不耐煩之心理乃另一鬥爭之種子，故切不可允許此等心理佔據人類之思想，務須進行正直之政策，以完成目標。渠在巴黎與法蘇外長會談時，即嘗表示應制止歐洲大陸上戰爭後果之繼續存在，當盡本身能力，並與願意合作者合作，而對於尙未表示合作者，亦應保持門戶之敞開。渠認對於彼不頗合作者目前旣不能以言辭使其滿意，當憑事實以向彼等證明。正當歐洲之團結似屬不可能之際，馬歇爾國務卿突不經討論，呼籲歐洲團結以資自助，並允許以美國之資源援助歐洲之復興，以期歐洲不致再遭浩刦，就歐洲方面言，不能再向美國提出質問，或要求解釋。歐洲應利用馬歇爾之慷慨建議，自動從事合作，以示歐洲分裂之說，僅無謂之談而已。</p>

<p>（一）「食米」租金</p>
<p>陳華勛問　鄙人於去年十月中向業主某頂得樓下廂房一間，頂時言明租金米五斗，按月照時價折合現金繳付。當時米價每石五萬四千元，故食米五斗，實合二萬七千元，鄙人因需房孔殷，不得已權且允諾，刻下食米飛漲，鄙人已不堪負担，日後更不堪設想，請問（一）房租以食米計算，是否合法？（二）當時乃口頭言定，並無契約，是否有效？（三）鄙人已不能負祖，是否可以拒絕照付？（四）如拒絕照付，應取何種手續？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）房租以食米計算於法無據？（二）租賃契約未以字據訂立者，視為不定期限之租賃，口頭契約原非法所不許，不過違反民法第七十一條法所禁止之規定者，自屬無效。（三）常事人可以依法衡情相互協商。（四）協商不諧，可以聲請法院核增租金。</p>

<h3>商聯會發表宣言　力爭國大立委名額　舉十大理由反對立院削減</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國商聯會常務理事及特種委員會，昨日下午四時，假金谷飯店招待新聞界。該會理事長王曉籟·理事朱惠淸·姬奠川·喬森榮·壽景俾等相繼報吿；職業團體立法委員及國大代表名額分配標準，有失公允，商聯會將聯合全國各省市縣商業團體據理力爭。商聯會已組織特種委員會，公推王曉籟·陸小波·朱惠淸·駱淸華·王繹齋·壽景偉·李荐廷等七人為委員，專門從事此項運動，並發表長達二千五百餘字之宣言，臚列十大理由，反對立法院對職業團體中立法委員及國大代表名額之削减。其大要如下：</p>
<p>一再變更最高會議決定</p>
<p>職業團體立法委員選舉名額，初經國防最高委員會決定為一一九名，嗣經立法院議決擅减為五十六名，而國民大會代表之職業名額四百五十名，則照原數通過，同一對象，而決議兩歧，同一標準，而數額互異。嗣以政府改組，國防會撤銷，遂由國務會議重行決定為一一二名，詎仍為立法院變更，减為八四名，輒以建戰形式，幷於休會之前，迭成旣成事實，送請國務會議勉予事後追認。皇皇大法，旣由最高權力機關一再決議，依「國民政府立法程序綱領」之規定，「一切法律案由政治會議決定原則，立法院不得變更」，今立法院一再擅自變更最高會議之決定案，其屬毀法亂紀，破壞憲政之精神，殊無疑義。</p>
<p>再査行憲以前之立法委員，山國府任命而非民選，其性質乃政府之官吏，國民政府實為其母體。以政府官吏而抗拒政府命令令紀何在？國法何存？今國府為遷就事實，對立法院非法擅定不合實際需要之名額，率予承認，實不無削足就履之嫌。</p>
<p>置社會部分配標準於不顧</p>
<p>聯業界之國大代表及立法委員之各郃門分配名額，理宜參照過去標準，審核現有會員總額，以及歷史沿革，公平核定，並宜尊重主管機關之意見，予以條文化，而形成法律，公諸社會。此次立法院竟置社會部所擬分配標準於不顧，而擅自憑空配給，有若施捨，高下隨心，抺煞一切，純以主觀愛惡，乘機儘量發揮權威。</p>
<p>應予規定標準比例增加</p>
<p>査國大代表總數逾三千名，商界十三名，僅佔千分之四，立法委員總數逾數百名，商界五名，僅佔千分之六，竟不知何所根據？即以同一工商，何以立法委員分予百分之十七，而國民代表，又僅予百分之七？且以全部職業界分配而言，究係以會員之多寡為標準？抑係以知識之高下為標準？究係以地位之輕重為標準？抑係以人格之優劣為標準？誠令人百思不得其解。吾人幷不反對農工之數額提高，亦甚歡迎新聞界及敎育界之名額加多，但應規定標準，比例增加，以資平允。</p>
<p>愛護國家從未後於各界</p>
<p>商業團體在我國是有六七十年以上之歷史，其相織　於全國，且服務社會，愛護國家，亦從未落於各界之後，歷次革命，商界同人無役不與，捐款獻糈，無不竭力輸將。北伐之役，我商果對於國民革命之貢獻，無論事前之掩護，事中之接濟，事後之效力，事實昭昭，猶歷歷在目。國父北上宣言，對職業團體參加政治，力加提倡，可謂前事不忘。後事之師。</p>
<p>犧牲最大賦稅負担最重</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，商人首先奮起，犧牲最大，而賦稅負担輒較任何團體為重，旋復歷險犯難，懋遷有無，爭取物資，調劑供求，以繁榮大後方，而進謀全民經濟之總動員。方令戰爭未熄，烽火益厲，工商事業已瀕崩潰邊緣，政府苦心孤詣，正在力籌挽救，而工商業者，亦殫精竭智，以期突破難關，共圖國家富强。若政治上反予以歧視壓迫，豈非政府自削其基礎，自毀其戡亂建國之力量乎？謀國公忠者寗忍出斯下策。</p>

<h3>港足球義賽　華聯遭慘敗　海軍五比二大勝</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕一幕振災足球賽，使靜寂已久的加山球塲，平添一番熱鬧。五日（週六）烈日當空，影響球塲空氣不少。</p>
<p>義賽前是夏令足球揭幕戰，由九龍巴士隊對漢英會，巴士隊得李天生鎭壓後防，全隊演來較見有勁，結果凈勝四比零，前半時各無所得，進球都在下半場。</p>
<p>接着義賽上演，海軍對華聯，球　是奧馬，開賽的時候，華聯猛攻，石金，石友頻施猛射，但不是中柱，就是被接，尋且德祺戰塲，華聯僅以十人應戰，於是形勢轉變。</p>
<p>海軍急激反攻，廿四分鐘時，中鋒西地士得球深入，均幹衝出太早，被射空門，華聯先負一球</p>
<p>繼而海軍又得機湧進，在混攻中，右輔用頭碰入一隻，二比零，華聯在前半時中竟得光蛋。</p>
<p>休息過後，華聯調整障容，洪祺出替乃兄任右翼，錦河作輔，英祺則與炳照易位，這一來，有點生氣，五分鐘後英祺即在十碼處得機起脚，球擦柱八網，扳成二比一。</p>
<p>此後十分鐘內，華聯是全盛時代，可惜不得門而入，久攻不下，頹勢畢現，接連再被海軍打入三隻，始見錦河搶回一球，成五比二終塲。</p>
<p>的確，華聯敗得慘了，可是疲於氣，乏合作，不敗何待！海軍演來够快，够作戰精神，勝利是努力爭回來的。此賽雙方愼重點將，排出陣勢如下：</p>
<p>（海軍隊）</p>
<p>布勞　格林美　英格　西奇士　巴蘭士　士的臣　烈倫　龍氏　西地土　馬打土　柏利云</p>
<p>（華聯隊）</p>
<p>譚均幹　謝錦洪　霍耀華　羅偉權　郭英祺　劉慶材　李石友　卓石金　李炳照　李德祺　謝錦河　李洪祺</p>

<h3>星島南征觀感（一）</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡航訊〕六月二十二日（星期日）在炎陽之下，長勝的香港星島足球隊，終以一比三爲馬來亞華人聯合隊（簡稱馬華）所屈服，這是星島遠征以來的首次失利，也是數月來球國裏最驚奇的消息。論演出，這一塲殊欠精彩，論成效馬華的確比星島好，三對一的比較，一點不誇張、事實上那天馬華的前鋒，只要稍爲合作一些，再多二個球也是可能的。不錯，星島之受挫，確實給予我們不少的刺激和超度的興奮，但在我們的心弦上，總覺得不滿足，不痛快，因爲這一天星鳥全隊的演出，都異樣的失常，在它失常的情况下取勝，難免還遺留着一種推敲的凝思。比賽前，當地報紙誇稱這是明年全運足球錦標的冠亞軍爭逐戰，胡氏昆仲（胡蛟胡好）各抱一見，彼此對各該球隊都抱有必勝的信念，在這種情形之下，我們所期望的是一塲工力悉敵的龍爭虎鬧，但結果却是一面倒，沒精打彩的小玩意。馬華雖勝，也勝得不痛快，星島在此地一連四戰，四次的陣容，除了門將以外，都沒有更改。</p>
<p>朱兆恒　余耀德　劉天申　侯榕生　馮坤勝　許竟成　宋靈聖　劉松生　黎兆榮　朱永強　馮景祥　小告山奴</p>
<p>（鄒文治第一戰演出）</p>
<p>最先二塲的戰績，始終以正前鋒朱永强，左翼劉松生和左後衛劉天申三人的表演最佳，整個來說，星島弱於守衛，而銳於進攻，進攻的技術是三角短傳，勝於兩翼傳中，最可惜的是星島征菲之役，有好幾位一流的球員受了傷，因此在星洲的幾塲比賽，始終未能以理想的陣容出現。左翼曹秋亭和內鋒張金海，就是因傷不克臨塲的兩員健將。劉松生以左中衛改司左翼，雖然勝任愉快，但無形中却把中衛綫的實力削弱了很多，名震一時的正中衛許竟成，頗有今昔之非，他那明快的頭脚，雖然一樣存在，可惜胖重的軀體，已影響了他的敏捷動作，從前的許竟成是最善於押着球兒進退，到如今却只落得退作第三後衛，不僅失盡昔年氣貫全場的雄風，就連守關拒敵，也時犯盲陽之弊。</p>

<h3>承購紡調會配紗　應於限期內出貨　紡綢會四次委會研討業務計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會第四次委員會議，於昨日上午十時卅分，在該會會議室舉行。到鄒主委，王副主委，委員劉泗英，吳味經，李升伯，唐星海，榮爾仁，張文潛，石鳳翔，袁仲遠等。討論迄下午一時許始吿散會，茲將各要案探誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）鄒主委提出舫調會整個舫調業務計劃一厚册，內容主要可分兩點二（甲）積極方面：全國棉紡事業建設計劃，包括原棉增產目標，紡錠攘充枚數，各項紡織機器設備之充實等項。（乙）消極方面：如何賞澈紗布調節政策，如何加強生產，成品如何合理配銷，包括本市配銷，供應外埠，及推廣外銷等項。各出席委員，以該項計劃內容，精詳冗長，有待個別研究後，再提供意見討論。當決定俟十一日召開第五次委員會時再付討論。</p>
<p>（二）爲避免共同配銷之棉紗，轉入囤積居奇之途起見，舫調會對所配之棉，如領記者承購後，逾一個半月仍不出貨者。將由紡調會依原配價收回。</p>
<p>檢驗棉花有待決定</p>
<p>（三）爲確定下半年度各地棉花品質標準，檢騐棉花滲水滲雜辦法，有待施行。惟究應由經濟部商品檢騐局，抑農林部執行檢騐工作，尙有待當局決定，以資遵循。</p>
<p>（四）六區棉紡公會，已有棉紗約七千件，提交舫調會供給共同配銷之用。該批棉紗之預約單，可於今日由紡調會送交中國舫建公司，故明日起，共同配銷棉紗之數額，可望增加。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該會鄒主委，已於昨晚晋京。聞對該會今後之舫調政策，將向中樞當局，有所請示云</p>

<p>華股昨恍惚不定，增資之前，人心對永紗不無流通之念，中途仍多蠢動，終以十七日起，現遞均須停止交易，而新股登塲期未定，存多不無乘高先溜者，散戶終吿潰敗。除景福有二〇四號之不時吸收籌碼，結局尙穩外，餘股均吿步降，而以疲態結束。永紗收後且賡續喊低。晨初人心尙堅，各股開出均昻，遞永紗開高至一〇七〇〇元。開後二二四號二三一號六五號七六號八九號均進，自一〇六五〇元起，升高至一〇八三〇元。六一號二一三號四號一四一號二三五號一七四號九于號脫手，退至一〇七五〇元。後傳經紀人代表又有被召赴京，證金有减低之說，二二四號八九號二三二號一五四號一五三號一〇二號五六號二二三號進至一一〇二〇元。此後五和雖由八九號掛高至漲停板，但遞永紗經二三五號一五二號八五號一四八號一〇四號九一號六〇號一七七號六九號之供售，步降至一〇六五〇元。一三四號二二三號一四號進至一〇八〇〇元外，九一號二二三號九四號一〇四號一二五號一四二號二三二號一四九號紛售。聞永紗有暫停交易說，人心見怯。遞永紗步降至一〇五〇〇元低價。三一號交通乘低來納，人心漸定，二二四號二一八號五五號四號一五五號二二三號二二六號一〇四號六九號俱進，漲風一起，爲勢甚速，突有軋空，不久竟飛躍至一一〇五〇元高價。一七一號一五七號乘機出龍，而號迫回頭，不久永紗實行增資，自十七日起，規遞均暫停交易。其新股何日上塲，却未提及，果於市塲揭示。六〇號二二四號一五二號亦舊，回跌至一〇五五〇元。一七七號七七號二三一號一六〇號雖來進至一〇八〇〇元，景福由二〇四號之努力吸收，遂步上漲，爲狀頗堅。臨收時浮多迫於時間，一一二號一四三號一〇二號復賣，而以一〇六五〇元收市。收後一四三號一〇二號二一八號二三號一〇四號七五號均有了結，最後降入一〇五〇〇元以下。結果較前收計即交股計景福漲半成，永紗信和華豐新光動興中法美亞新華均吿微升，永公微挫，五和雖吿漲停，成交並不普遍，中絲大通水泥統益各升半成，中紡景綸麗安微升，火柴平平，內衣商務微挫，國貨跌半成。遞交計永紗美亞景福華鹽微升，新光微挫，永公信和平平，勤興跌半成，塲外各老股計閘北中華上市期近，各漲半成，五洲微降，餘者稍漲。</p>
<h3>統債外股均疲</h3>
<p>公債昨形勢平庸，中途轉形不支。晨開統丙七一〇〇元，自七二〇〇元起，由二三〇室三六〇室供給，降至六七〇〇元。五三九室五〇三室等來進，尙易轉穩，午收以七〇〇〇元結束。成交約一百餘萬，結果較前收計甲乙丙各跌一百元，統丁挫二百元，統戊尙平。</p>
<p>外股昨求供平衡，以致過程頗見平靜，怡紗亦不過二千元起仆。金業中人及北帮廣帮均供，洋商以及銀行帮證券帮有納，結果較前收僅業廣微升，鋼業紙業航業電話墾植微挫，怡紗英聯怡啤均吿平定。</p>
<p>黃金購買外匯　目下恐難以實現</p>
<p>經濟改革方案中有黃金購買外匯之擬議，此項問題，經全國經濟委員會交由中央銀行研究，據悉：中央銀行有關部門，已分別提出意見，即將送達經委會作最後決定。據國行業務局邵副局長曾華，以個人資格表示，費金購賈外匯，今日實有不宜，因實施以後，黃金更成爲奇貨，一般無外匯之商人，爭相競購，其漲風至足驚人，反而刺激金價，其他物價亦有被波動之可能。又某經濟權威亦有同樣見解，對於此項措施，認爲有害無利，不表贊同</p>
<h3>遞交證金存國行　可望通融辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕財經兩部命令，證交對遞交部份之三成證金，以其中百分之七十改繳存國行，各證交經紀人咸感不便，因按過去情形，遞交證金百分之八十至一百，係存中交兩行，而各經祀人亦在中交兩行辦理交割，可以當日抵帳。頃據財部負責人語記者，該項證金母庸改存國行，或可通融辦理，惟原來命令係由政院決定，故常待政院最後採擇。</p>
<h3>紡織業之喜訊　印度綢緞市場好轉</h3>
<p>頃據確息，印度綢緞市塲，近已好轉，市價有每碼飛升十二至十三盧比者，最低亦在五盧比以上。絲織協導會分批運往印度之綢緞，正進行交易中，如交易治妥，當倍於預期之利潤，此實爲我生絲加工以來之喜訊。</p>
<p>紡建配紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡調會辦理聯合配銷棉紗，共配紗一七四七件，全部配予廠商，申購單共二三八張云</p>
<p>人造絲挺進</p>
<p>昨市人造絲上落靡定，終吿挺進，銀根雖緊，仍無回小之象。一二〇號高山有光，上午開盤三千〇六十萬元，即有成交，人心振奮，不斷前進，最高喊到一百六十萬元雙出價，旋因多方　高價拋售，乃見下挫，三千〇七十萬元爲中午收盤價，下午終因配售貨仍無消息，持貨者不免居奇，又見挺升。最後價爲三千一百二十萬元遺，五十萬元出，卒比上日大起一百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經平穩</p>
<p>昨市廠經平穩，人造絲雖吿續升，但因供多於求，市價難於看好，高勻度五担頭昨日仍無做關，喊價依然未更。零担略有交易，市價稍見提高，高級零担C級貨成交價三千三百萬元，E級貨價做三千二百萬元。干經　呈活躍，零担二千一百三十萬元有成交，五拱頭亦乏成交，然喊復升起五十萬元之譜。</p>
<p>綢貨挫降</p>
<p>昨市綢貨被緞及格子　縐，因銀根關係，浮多出籠，忍痛割新，以致造成挫降之局面。大誠被面開市即小，一千三百十萬元尙乏　主，後做二百九十萬元。華强貨三百萬元開盤，最小二百七十五萬元有成交，後喊二百八十萬元賣出價。大誠　縐開市四萬一千四五萬元，供求失衡，即呈慘跌，由一千元而退至四萬〇七百元收市，比上日跌落一千元强，隔日期最後做一千一百元。</p>
<p>配售人絲意見一斑</p>
<p>四區絲織業得政府配給外匯，向　外訂購人造絲以應需用，但新舊會見，意見不一，有擬根據去年十二月份配售量照派，有主張實地調查，從新分配。據該業公會理事云：從新調查，實際支配，最爲確當。因去年十二月份配售量古樂不均，織造廠絲貨者亦得配售人造絲，而確實需用人造絲者，反而配量極少。故以目前確實需要量而定支配，最爲公允，捨此別無適當之送云。</p>
<h3>紗花布賡續上漲　互為因果籌碼愈趨愈少</h3>
<p>紗　棉紗價續上揚，聞紡調會收購民營紗幾佔總產額百分之七十五，人心惶惶，籌碼轉見枯竭，長江帮及廣帮頻有納意，加之布價猛跳，人心振蕩，價益飛騰，至收市略見下降，然終比昨上升甚多。廿支特雙馬最高一·二四〇萬，收市一·二二〇萬元，漲四十萬，雙馬一·一一五萬，挺四十五萬。廿四支細紗微高，十六支光明九七〇萬，倘廿萬，十支紗時値當令，價格最俏，十支童子軍九五〇萬，與十六支紗價格，幾乎相近。</p>
<p>布　棉布疊創新高價，尤以十二磅龍頭細布，領導上揚。據熟悉該業者云，龍頭細布，業外人不問價格，傾力進購。今日塲外成交，龍頭細布做價四十七萬六千，尙難收進。該業公會為避免刺激起見，即日起場內停止買賣，並嚴加查禁，非該業會員入塲交易。且今後下午亦停止交易云。</p>
<p>花　昨日現棉交易甚旺，場內以棉紗再起回漲，趨勢極為堅挺。並聞棉紗議價又有調整說，故紗廠儘先扒吸，客帮亦多抵補，市價較上日稍升。各檔做開送廠偎計靈寳二一〇萬，二一五萬至二二二萬，沙市一九四萬至一九九萬，漢細一八六萬五千，火機一六三萬，又棧交價計零寳一九六萬五千，二〇〇萬，二〇五萬，二一〇萬，二一五萬至二二〇萬。沙市一九一萬，一九三萬，一九七萬至一九九萬。漢細一七五萬，一八〇萬，一八二萬五千，一八六萬五千至一八八萬。三餘鎭一七二萬至一九八萬，老河口一八〇萬至一九一萬，順德一七二萬至一七八萬。山東脫力司一七二萬至一七八萬，火機一六〇萬至一六三萬，周浦籽花每組正牌三二萬二千。</p>
<h3>貨主急於脫售　粳秈繼續下落</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千八百餘石，天氣火熱，執貨者急於脫褒，奈店胃清淡勢一蹶不振。粳秈米續跌一二萬元，北市跌勢較南市更烈。白元陰元仍居疲乏之局，交易極少。麵粉去化淸閒，價格逐步修削，再低千元，麩皮胃呆不振，豆餅汕頭續辦，營口餅步升三五千元，廠餅鄕消不濃，微挺千元，黃豆客帮揀取，東北大豆去化尙俏，續漲三五千至萬元不一。其他杜黃漢口黃消化平平，暫無波動。菉南洋納胃蟬聯，再漲萬元。赤豆平站，蠶豆高貨挺定，中次交淡，下挫三五千元。苞米銷路呆木，回跌三五千元，莞豆定局，生仁華南進胃見懈，止漲轉跌，挫落一萬餘元。芝蔴洋莊搜購甚力，靑雲直上，繼續奔騰一二萬元，小麥廠方無意收購，狂跌萬元。油市先堅後平，菜油廣帮進納，續漲二萬餘元。豆油淸油本街略有交易，步砌一二萬元。蔴油漲定，生油彷彿。</p>
<h3>皖省發現磷酸鹽礦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕安徽鳳台附近，近發現磷酸鹽礦山二處，其貯藏量估計在二百五十萬噸以上。此項消息乃根據聯總昨日所接農業工作隊之報吿而來者。礦苗經聯總化學家分析後，認爲礦質極高，聯總刻正探討方法，以便利用該礦苗在中國製造磷酸肥料。</p>
<h3>國行貼放委會二月來工作概況　核准貸款三百六十億餘元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會，爲使各界明瞭該會兩月來工作推進情形起見，特於昨日下午四時許，在該會會議室，招待本市新聞界。該會秘魯長林樂　，分四點報吿該會工作概况。茲略誌談話內容如次：</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行貼放委員會，成立於本年四月初，截至六月卅日止，計接受申請案件二七三件，申請總額共八四，二六五百萬元，先後核准申請貸款案二〇九件，金額共三百六十億零二千萬元。（二）中央銀行張總裁，暨陳劉兩副總裁，均以增加生產爲目前之迫切要圖，爰訂立中央銀行對上海商業行莊申請辦理轉貼放辦法。一切出以審愼。貼放曾各委員會人選，均屬本市金融界工商界領袖，每次討論申請案件時，寬嚴適中，逐漸開展貼放會之使命。最近特訂定工業貸款案件處理程序，以爲準繩。（三）貼放會對於申請貸款案件之審核，力求簡單迅速。（四）關於貸款申手續，亦力求簡化云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕查該會自四月初成立以來，各月份核准之貸款案件及金額，逐月均見增加。四月份貸款案共廿九件，金額一，〇一〇百萬元。五月份貸款案共四一件，金額一一，〇五〇百萬元。六月份貸款案共一三九件，金額二三，九六〇百萬元。六月份所核准之貸款，佔貸款總額百分之六六·　三。又查已核准之貸款總額三百六十億〇二千萬元中，工貸所佔達百分之八六·　三七，工貸內又以棉染織工業所佔之百分比最鉅，計爲一一·　八五。毛紡織工業次之，計六·　三〇。三爲內衣織造工業，計六·〇八。</p>
<h3>外鈔茶堅穩</h3>
<p>向銷法屬非洲之抽珍，珍眉等綠茶，連日經一部份出口商積極騐　後，昨日市上，已有趨前問澤者，惟貨主心思頻轉堅化，售意不濃，致收市結果，吐納談判尙未獲得圓滿，交易依然陷於停頓，而市勢則愈益穩挺。他若內銷茶，進出仍佳，全日呈倘秀狀態，價格均與上日相仿。茲悉：本年婺源新炒靑，賈戶鋻於貨稀需殷，紛向產區搬運以來，刻下大中華茶葉公司等業已運到，但因採置成本及一切繳用，俱亟高昂，聞喊價比前砌加不已。</p>
<p>桐油猪鬃購銷新辦法　技術上尙待研究　出口商仍望不直接收購</p>
<p>桐油猪鬃之收購與銷售，政府當局已改訂辦法，由中信局向產區商人收購後，並轉售於出口商，出口商以外幣購買。此項新辦法，中信局正準備實施中。因有許多技術問題，尙待研究。據桐油猪鬃兩業領袖表示，此項辦法，較前確有改進。兩業人士極爲歡迎。因國內生產者，旣有掛路，而出口商復可代銷，自可堵塞走私之路。關於中信局直接在產區收購一點，仍認爲有與民爭利之嫌，兩葉人士，亦盼委托商人代爲收購。</p>
<h3>麥貨即可實施　總額為六百億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕醖釀已久之麥貸，原則早經確定，有於日內付諸實施之說。茲悉：該項麥貸共分兩部，一部係普通麥貸，各廠貸款數額，以每日生產量一千包貸款十億元爲準。貸款時各廠須繳塡貸款資金三成，預計貸款總額爲六百億元。另一部係代磨貸款，由政府委託福新，茂新，旱豐，華豐，裕通五廠代磨。各一廠繳塡貸款資金，與前一部同。貸款總額，約爲一千億元。</p>
<p>又本市七月份平價配粉，將俟該項麥貸發放後，由各廠每月撥出本粉廿六萬包，供應配銷云。</p>
<h3>輸廣會派員調查　溫州出口貨情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣會執委會前准中國銀行溫州分行函詢，略以該地帆船，常多載貨外運，請求向該行結匯，未知是否允予照結。該會以不明詳情，決待派員實地調本後，再據情規定處理辦法。茲悉：該會已於昨日派遺該會專門委員黃燕，會同中國銀行杭州分行甄副理，前往調查云。</p>
<p>台木到滬</p>
<p>現台灣楠木檜木續有到埠，賣方開價在六千四百元之間，洋松平穩，杉木疲軟。</p>
<h3>食糖配價提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物價評議會食糖評讓小組，昨午三時在社會局召開第七次會議。因台幣區率最近又有變更，故台糖公司第廿三期之配價亦經商討調整，較上期增加百分之三十強。新價經呈奉呈主委員開先核准後公佈如下：</p>
<p>（一）特號棉白每担配售六十三萬，批發價七十萬五千元。（二）號棉白每担配售價五十八萬，批發價六十五萬。（三）特號砂白每担配售價六十一萬，批發眞六十八萬三千元。（四）二號砂白每担配售價五十五萬，批發價六十一萬六千元。（五）赤砂糖每担配售價五十一萬，批發價五十七萬一千元。各糖商自今日起開始申請。</p>
<p>第五期計口授糖昨日小組會決議繼續辦理，於八月初開始發售，價格猶待商討決定。</p>
<h3>外埠小型紗廠　請求核配外棉</h3>
<p>常熟無錫太倉等三縣，十七家小型紗廠，頃派代表十餘人來滬，請求舫調會暨外棉核配會核配行總棉花。經列舉理由，函請六區紡織業同業公會轉爲呼籲，要點如下：</p>
<p>各地型紗廠過去由請核配外棉，乃紡管會規定紡錠設備不足三千枚者，不予核配。數次申請，悉遭批駁。但小型廠所有紡錠，若以個別計算，固屬無足輕重，倘以整個數量言之，於生產立塲，數亦可觀。於國計民生，不無貢獻。目前本外埠各大中型紗廠，均獲得配棉之優先權，則小型紗廠同業生產機構，是宜一體待遇，無分厚薄。近來棉價日漲，各小廠共擁有紡錠三萬二千枚，所需原料，均賴黑市採購，其出口開繳成本，遠較大廠為高，難與競爭，實已瀕於無法生存之境。爲維持工業，自應不分設備之多寡，原有規定，應請撤銷。並將行總所存外棉，迅即予以核定補配，以利生產。</p>
<h3>四月底抵埠外棉　花商請免予收購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉花商業同業公會，以中央銀行規定：在本年四月卅日前，業已抵埠，而無法在限額外棉中取得許可證者，該批棉花應歸中信局收購。而該批棉花屬於該會會員所有者，計達二萬担以上。該會爲擬請求當局體念商艱，免予收購計，特於昨日下午二時許，召開會員代表大會，當決定推派理事長劉　蓀，理事陳淸琤，孫炳之等，代表向中信局請求免予收購云。</p>

<h3>美國怎樣攻擊共產主義　美聯邦調查局局長</h3>
<p>— 胡佛</p>
<p>美國人土，目前不斷檢討防共辦法，口誅筆伐，深具眞知灼見，使美國共黨無法閃避眞理的，道德的透視，而把它的卑劣身份赤裸裸的顯露出來了。美國文化言論界的檢討共黨，特別値得我們借鏡。而六月九日出版的「新聞週刋」，以反共爲中心題材，發表胡彿氏反共名言，尤有一讀之必要。。</p>
<p>我們防禦共產主義的上策，就是我們</p>
<p>美國式的</p>
<p>生活方法。美國共黨除了暗裏造謠中傷，造成混亂，企圖削弱國民對民主工作的信念外，絕難達到它顛覆政府的希望。我們有最堅强的民主政治，有比全球各地更多的自由，更高的生活水準，可是，我們的政府！它作爲世界擾攘中的指導明燈已經兩世紀了！目前是紅色法西斯侵略美國的目標。它是阻止世界變成紅色法西斯世界的中流砥柱。</p>
<p>我們不能忽視這一侵略。我們要對它作正面的遭遇與追擊，但要在美國方法以內。我們要避免用三K與南美哥林比亞及一些法西斯國家的鬥爭方式，正如我們避免用共產黨的鬥爭方式一樣。絕對的傾右與向左是同樣危險的。在法西斯主義與共產主義之間，是全無選擇之餘地，兩者同是極權主義，反民主，反上帝。兩渚均以反叛和奸詐手段來達到它專制獨裁的目的。我們與共產黨鬥爭，用不着採取爲法西斯主義和共產主義所慣用的特務制度。</p>
<p>我們曾經在此次大戰中，致力保護自己而反間諜反怠工，並無犧牲一般的公民法權。目前亦能用同樣的防禦策略，民主方式，以及美國人的生活方法，來保護自己而反抗共產主義的浸透作用。</p>
<p>我們最可靠的武器是眞理；共產黨實在經不起光天化日的透視。他們的有效工作是帶上一副私藏的假面具。謊話和欺詐是他們的主要工具。實在沒有比他們再卑劣下賤的詭計手段了！但彼等乃善爲遁詞逃避的能手，共產主義的「上帝」列寗的談話就是他們的遁詞。據列寗稱：「從來革命者不能同時採取合法及違法暴動的方式去鬥爭，那是最要不得的革命」。</p>
<p>保持美國式的生活方法的</p>
<p>反共鬥爭</p>
<p>底第一步，就是首先暴露共產主義本來目標，然後把它和美國生活方式加以比較。</p>
<p>共產黨有兩個組織：一爲「外圍」及其尾巴是完全公開的。彼等從事吶喊詐僞的宣傳空論，而提出許多「莫須有」的標職：「反共」，「反動」，甚或「希特勒信徒」之類的名詞，加於所有擯棄他們的敎條的人民。任何人反對蘇聯就是「法西斯」，「帝國主義」，「獨裁資本主義」者．共產騙子或共產隊伍也讚民主，但他們只「道其所道非吾之所謂這」。彼等以「進步」爲詞，躱掩其陰謀於勞工，社會福利，及敎育的僞言中。</p>
<p>另一組織——即爲地下組織——爲具有嚴格訓練的共黨隊伍，他們極力抑止他言偽而辯的言談，而緊緊躱飾着自己。此爲最危險的共產人物。　共黨黨章前言稱：「共黨的工作全爲和平與消滅法西斯而鬥爭」，就是最典型的騙語。　我們曾記得，當共產主義與法西斯主義一度同盟時（按指德蘇同盟），共產黨言</p>
<p>威脅白宮</p>
<p>反對租眾擎易舉支，反對志願兵法，及美洲聯防法。而當蘇聯離了它的同盟變爲與德國爲敵時，美共則又澈夜變換口號，而高呌振蘇，充實軍備，以及開闢第二戰綫。</p>
<p>共黨份子謀以武力暴動爲革命手段的事實，見諸共黨公務員之公開陳說而昭彰明甚。一個敎師勸吿同學說：「我們必需學習憎恨資本階級，無憎恨便無鬥爭。我們……工人階級的前鋒，必需敎導工人學習憎恨……面臨流血，我們必使血濺市井，一如彼等血洗俄羅斯，工人必需被組織起來，當革命來臨時始能免於失敗。」共產黨幾乎一致認爲除非一個一如總罷工的「大危機」之降臨，革命是不會起來的，一個對外戰爭能够轉移爲內戰或經濟大恐慌？</p>
<p>我們從此得到提示，就是只要縱續民主工作生活，則共黨念念不忘的「大危機」，永難來臨。</p>
<p>共黨曾經特別對全體黨員規範其意識，工人日報引用史達林的話說：「我們澈底地應用列寗嘗試用過的方式來範圍黨員意識……一個黨員絕對服從黨紀，貢獻黨費及其職賣與工作於組織。」</p>
<p>我們如果不能有着對共產黨徒的目的和計劃底廣泛認識與瞭解，我們就不能有效地壓制共黨的威迫。這種認識將能從良好的美國公民底心裏把共產黨驅逐出去　但是這類的情報資料將從那裏獲得呢？</p>
<p>美國報界</p>
<p>和播音界卻很警覺地防禦着紅色法西斯主義的威脅，曾做過一番値得贊美之揭發共黨惡跡的工作。我們已向着正確的方向前進了。</p>
<p>我曾注意到一般發言人都小心地運用「共產黨」這個名義。把「共產黨」這個名義來加諸那些爲人誠實，品行端正的美國自由份子及進步份子，而其原由僅係由意見上底差異的，是一種欺騙而又危險的舉動。我們必須把自由份子和已鈹公認的共產黨徒很明顯地劃分出來。雖然共黨曾標榜他們是前進的份子，但道些千萬的純正自由及進步份子是共黨的最有力和最有決定作用的敵入。</p>
<p>報紙，雜誌，廣播電台及很多專門書籍之評論共產主義者，多是最眞確消息資料底源泉。——道些將可供給愛國公民以可靠的事實。</p>
<p>晚近國會</p>
<p>裏從新對共黨問題發生了興趣，這可從衆議院「達反美國人民利益行勸調查委員會」底活動可以看出，這個委員會負賣公佈關於在美國境內非美國力量底活動的事實。而那工作又必須獲得忠誠愛國的美國人的合作。</p>
<p>該委員會在其檔案中保存有很多寳貴的參考資料，這如果能被細心地運用，可爲參老者最良的情報米源。至於聯邦調查局就不同了，它必須把談局的一切檔案保持得絕對秘密。</p>
<p>美國公民們必須注意到與他們階層有關的一切事實，他們須與他們有關之一切機稱底組繼及他們子女所攻讀的各學校底情况保持濃厚興趣與密切注意，乃至他們有關工會的人們所選舉作爲入民公僕的是什麼的一種人物。</p>
<p>每一個公民都有權並旦是他們的責任去選舉那些忠於美國生活方式的人去担任國家的事務。一個不忠於國家的地方政府或州政府或聯邦政府裏的公務員，因其有叛國行爲或宣傳馬克斯哲學，可能對國家發生危害的作用。因爲共黨宣稱他們爲一政黨，他們自應有權參加政府，如民主黨，共和然一探；其實他們僅係一種有國際性犯罪陰謀的一部份工作人員，他們根本</p>
<p>不是政黨</p>
<p>—工會向來都為共黨的目標。共黨並沒有忘記列寗的敎訓：　「我們爲着達到滲入工會裏，並進展而宣簿共產主義，不惜任何犧牲，用盡種種方法，即使它是和法律抵觸，但可巧言掩飾，務求達到目的而止。」　美國對於工會的觀點，正如詹姆甘巴氏所我：「欲爲一個良好的工會會員，必須先爲一個良好的美國人」。</p>
<p>在工會裏的共產黨員　和各地的共產黨一樣——聽命於共黨最高當局。他們荒謬的把共黨的目的和勞工的目的混爲一談，看作一樣。</p>
<p>共產黨爲大多數並非隸屬於工會的，在最近共黨的會議中，某工黨領袖承認共產黨員僅佔各地</p>
<p>工會會員</p>
<p>人數的百分之十八至十九。又某一個擁有一萬個會員的工會裏，僅五百個共產黨員，便控制了整個工會。在其他一個工會喪，八千五百個會員企圖把該工會從共產黨手上挽救出來，竟遭受失敗，而該工會不過僅有共產黨會員一百各而已。更有一共產黨員運用手館，竟能左右工會會議的議決案。</p>
<p>思想進步的美國工會會員，如能和共黨一樣對工會的事情關心一點，可能很快地避免共黨的威脅。</p>
<h3>南洋一個有趣的小國　沙羅越奇聞　華僑一票決定了江山誰屬</h3>
<p>— 福州四日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>閩粵二省旅外僑胞，足跡遍及南洋各島嶼，匪特黨握着各僑居地的經濟權力，而且，對於當地社會的興替亦具有舉足輕重的力量。記者在此於偶然機會中與初自沙羅越亡國的僑界人士王世欽先生晤面，承吿沙羅越這小小的王國其亡國的經過甚詳，其中涉及沙國的獨特作風與制度，令人憧憬着馬托邦共和國的那套理想。尤其談到華僑一票如何決定了沙國的國祚，頗饒趣味，國內報章尙未加以傳揚，國人知者殊鮮，特爲文介紹以賽讀者。</p>
<p>彈丸小國豐饒豐富</p>
<p>沙羅越王國，立國於北婆羅洲，面積幾二十萬二千方公里，相等於我廣東一省。全國分六省，省下分設若千縣，首都在古晋（Kuching），境內河流特多，交通稱便。人口約卅四萬，約等福州一市，內中馬來亞人七八萬，黛亞人（Dya）oh棕色土著民族）十五萬餘人，華僑十一萬餘人。十九世紀有名的沙羅越開墾運動，競是閩淸人黃乃裳率領福州人前往墾殖的，所以，沙羅越全境間僑相當多。相傳一百零五年前，英國水手到達沙羅越，佔領該地成立王國，自居爲國王，至今傳到第三代，由烏拉札（Rajah）執政，因其國小，未與其他國家演過正式的外交關係，國內工商業頗爲發達，農產品以烟草，水果，木材，橡皮爲多，所產木材稱爲鹽柴（Billiam）堅硬如鐵，干年不腐，允稱珍產。礦產以金，鐵，煤油等爲豐富，其中尤以煤油儲量相當可觀，英商亞細亞煤油公司的油源主要取給於沙羅越的媒田，金的存量也很可觀，惜未大量開採。國內地廣人稀，物產豐饒，倒也顯得民生當裕。</p>
<p>官吏勤政人民守法</p>
<p>這個國家稱國泰民安貴居國王，却休休有容，任何人民均可晋見，政府中各級行政官吏常與民衆接觸，博徵民隱，毫無官僚習氣，政風淳樸，官民相處甚治。人民守法，蔚為風範，即使偶然犯了法，咸知向法院自首，少聞通緝逃亡或逮捕之情事，判了徒刑之刑犯，可以請假回家省親，不必覓保，法院起解刑犯，勿須法警押送，僅以一紙公文交刑犯本身自行持往報到。違警事件甚少，社會秩序安定。政府撙節開支，不輕易增稅加重人民負祖，人民亦少有逃稅走私之現象。商業市塲，購求信用，在沙羅越國土地上向難保證制度之根植，充分表現了大同世界「講信修睦」的理想。</p>
<p>負欠戰債退讓王位</p>
<p>太平洋戰事發生，沙羅越也遭到，當時烏拉扎王率領當地的黛亞族土人與日軍作遊擊戰，以英國飛機作掩護，殲滅了不少敵人，土人驍勇善戰，以砍日軍級首爲榮，南洋日軍提起沙羅越黛亞族土人無不噤若寒蟬。惟在數年戰爭過程中，沙國舉了英國二千多萬金磅的戰債，這樣龐大的數目戰後沙國無力歸還，烏拉札王以一方面英國索債孔急無法拖延，一方面又雅不欲闢稅以加重人民的負擔，在此兩難之下，去年沙王斷部決定以沙國交與英國統治，作爲償此戰債的代價，英方早已垂涎沙國資源，當亦有意接受，被時王弟乃向倫敦提出抗護，要求英國不應乘危侵害沙國獨立主權，因而沙國內形成贊同與反對以獨立主權讓與英國之二派，前者由國王領導，後者由王弟領導，開始了激烈的政治鬥爭。</p>
<p>華僑一票沙國中殤</p>
<p>最後訴諸民意，由議會舉行公開投標表決。在投票之前，雙方實力旗鼓相當，二派所擁有的票數恰恰相等，其中惟有表中立之華僑議員一票，作爲競爭的焦點。結果，此華僑一粟贊同歸向英國，享祚一百零五年的沙羅越王國宣吿天折，烏拉札王遜位，英國遣派總督到沙，此小小王國從此淪於殖民地位，劃入大英帝國的版圖。</p>
<p>人民守法重信，政府仁政親民，沙羅越雖屬無足輕重的小國，倒有她的完美的理想社會。今後，屈居於殖民地地位，失去了獨立自主的精神，我人對此誠不勝其惋惜。尤其在戰後舉世弱小民族掀起民族自決運動浪潮中竟然有把國家主權拱讓他人，不能不算是一件奇聞。</p>

<h3>論東之責任</h3>
<p>— 魏文翰</p>
<p>伏波兵艦與海閩商輪碰撞後，海閩船長被押；伏波被難家屬除向各方呼籲外，並直接向海閩所有人國營招商局請求救濟。利濟實業公司，因雇用海員糾紛，其經理人被毆流血。中亞輪船在九江附近失火，被難家屬結羣毆打代理行號。上開種種事件，屢在各報以顯明地位刋登，引起一般人對船東賣任問題之注意。按輪船事業，亦與其他事業相等，同受國家法律上合法保障。然論其性質，係一種含有冒險性之事業。例如風浪，潮汎，雨，霧，暗礁以及其他一切難於避免之碰撞，擱淺情事。故對於貨物之運送，自古代運送業開始以來，船貨雙方之權利義務，均有規定。如貨物係包裝性質者，則有租船合同之規定。如貨物係零碎裝運性質者，則有載貨證券之規定。是項規定，基於世界各海商國家之公約。最近一次會議，於一九二二年在比國巴拉蘇市舉行。根據是項規約，英國於一九二四年制定並公佈施行貨物海運法。茲附抄第四節第二項之規定如左：</p>
<p>運送人或船舶對於下列各項所發生之滅失損害不應負賣。</p>
<p>甲：因管理船舶或使船舶航駛之船長，海員，引港人或運送人之雇員所爲之一切不經意或過失之行為。</p>
<p>乙：火燒但運送人之實際過失或參加所致者不在此限。</p>
<p>丙：海中或可航行水中之一切海難危險及事變。　丁：天災（人力不可抗力者）　戊；戰事。</p>
<p>己：公敵。</p>
<p>庚：君王人民之拘捕制止，或合法之扣留。</p>
<p>辛：因防除疾病傳染所受之拘束。</p>
<p>壬：託運人，貨主或其代理人或代表人之一切行為或不爲。</p>
<p>癸：無論任何原因發生之工潮，全部的或局部的一切罷工，阻工，滯工，禁工等情。</p>
<p>子：騷擾及民衆暴動。</p>
<p>丑：在海中對於生命財物所爲之救獲，或意圖救護之行爲。</p>
<p>寅：因貨物本身原有瑕疵性質腐敗所發生整裝重量之損壞，或其他滅失損害等事。</p>
<p>卯：包裹之瑕疵。</p>
<p>辰：記號之瑕疵或不充分。</p>
<p>已：暗藏之瑕疵，雖用愼重方法而不能發現者。</p>
<p>午：無論任何原因，其發生並非運送人之實際錯誤，或參加或其代理人僱員之實際錯誤過失所致者。但欲取得本段兔責利益之人，應負舉證之責，證明其滅失損害並非運送人之實際錯誤，或參加或其代理人僱員之實際錯誤，或不經意所致者。</p>
<p>上開各項規定，係各　商國家所奉行者，我國當不容例外。</p>
<p>其次關於旅客之運送及生命之傷亡，船方與被維方因無類似載貨證券之規定，雙方權利養務，殊費解釋。然船舶運送，究係冒險事業，若千因素，均非人力所可絕對控制，失事及過失，均在所難兔。在原則上，應按上述貨運規定辦理。倘一經發生死亡情節，而船長即遭拘禁，被處以殺人之罪；而船東即有被毆打之咸脅，則重要之運諭事業，將被視爲畏途。誠非國家社會之福。故我國必須採取各海商國家公允之法規，執法衡情，作合理之處置。船長均領有執照，執行職務，決無逃亡之虞。而船東旣有船舶行駛，亦有充份擔保資產，不應週事覊押，妨害執行職務，有礙交通。再船東對因船舶而發生之賠償責任，亦有限度。我國海商法第廿三條第一項，明白規定。</p>
<p>（按：該條淵源於一九一五年萬國海事公約）船東所負之最大責任，爲船舶本身價値，該次航行運費及因蒙損害而收受之賠償金額。</p>
<p>至關於船員受雇事，船東應有自由雇用權，不受任何方之強迫威脅，按工會之組設，本係合法之組織。推其原意，應以自身國結，增進服務效能爲宗旨，對雇主原無强迫受雇之意。即使工會所爭者爲介紹權，亦應本身加强組織，增進服務效能，使雇主願意接受其介紹，而增進　傭關係之密切合作。</p>
<p>當此全國輪船業聯合會召開成立大會，全國人士矚視航運之時，切盼我國行政及司法當局效法各海商先進國家之請神，勿令船東作過重之負荷。復盼海員工會領導海員，循入正軌，以達到船東與雇員之精誠合作。</p>

<h3>宋詞舉</h3>
<p>— 睡禪</p>
<p>陳匪石編著正中書局印</p>
<p>這是正中書局最近出版的一部詞選，列入大學叢書。作者從前曾以此本授人。序中述成書之由曰：「比年以來，　舍之中，强以講授，而　日限之，收千里於尺　，吐滂沛乎寸心，旣不易為，蹊徑住其塞茅，寸陰擲諸虛牝，又非所忍……乃先就所選之宋十二家，各舉數首，附著其所校理者，輯錄者，並申咫見，以與諸生講習，名之曰宋詞舉云」。此審不但作者自己用過，便是友好中借作敎本者亦多，確是學詞的最好門徑書。</p>
<p>此書共選錄南宋六家，北宋六家。凡例第一條中說：「鄙意學詞，當先南宋而後北宋，而終以五代與唐。近人講歷史，有用逆溯法者，茲傲其例，起張炎，訖晏幾道，依時代編次，後者居前，前者居後，庶乎由博返約，沿委求源。」南宋六家為張炎，王沂孫·吳文英·姜　·史達祖·辛棄疾。作者以為「戈順卿取史·姜·吳·周·王·張六家，周雅圭取姜·史·吳·王·蔣·張六家，周止庵則以辛·王·吳為領袖，然蔣捷身世之感，同於王張，雕琢之工，導源吳氏，周密又附唐於吳」，故皆舍而不取。至「史達祖則步趨淸眞，幾於顰笑悉合，雖非戛戛獨造，而南渡以降，專為此種格調者，實無其匹，故不敢廢。」作者之意，欲初學為詞者，「先於張王求雅正之音，以吳鍊其氣息，以姜拓其胸襟，以辛健其羣力，而旁參之史，以望北宋之堂室。」北宋六家為周邦彥·秦觀·蘇軾·賀　·柳永·張幾道。作者不欲效　戈·周，舉周邦彥以槪其餘，以為「先路之導，不止一家。蘇軾寓意高遠，運筆空虛。秦觀　雅婉約，卓然正家，賀　洗　之功，運化之妙，實周吳所自出，小全又為百餘年結　。柳永高運處，　勁處，沈雄處，體會入微處，皆非他人所到。慢詞格調，亦成於柳。四人皆周所取則，學者所應致力。」至於北宋小全，作者只取要幾道一家，以為「砥柱中流」，由是上稽李·馮·章·溫，「薪盡火傳，淵源易溯」云。</p>
<p>全書共得詞五十三首，南宋廿七首，北宋廿六首，眞是精而又精，少無可少。每家錄其生平事蹟，版本源流。每首先附校記，次考律，又次論詞。每舉一家，即具其原委，每舉一詞，即具其要領．作者自謂「一隅雖　，或能反三，濫觴雖微，終於匯海，蓋欲學者觸類旁通，由是而龍讀，能解，馴至於能作。」蓋作者深憾詞人「或不肯泄其秘，或不屑筆之書，否則馳怳忽之辭，若玄妙而莫測，摭膚淺之說，每渾淪而無紀，學者捫　叩槃，莫知奧竅，知句而不知徧，知徧而不知篇」。故不惜金針度與，寫成此書，學者熟讀深思，不患不能登堂入室。</p>
<p>此書原係鉛印講義本。民國十六年寫定，徐仲可見之，慫　作者問世而未果，藏之篋中，又十餘年，其後作者避寇入川，「與喬大壯窟室相逢，輙共商討，理而董之，雲殲隆隆，若弗聞也。」這是民國三十年十月問事。再隔六年，方見此本。其間增損甚多，與原本略異矣。</p>
<h3>社會學入門</h3>

<p>人類是不能離開了社會而單獨生存，這是現時代誰都知道的，人祇有在社會裏才能生存，而在我們的社會裏面，一切情形發展，是錯綜複雜的；因而，我們必需去認識這個五色繽紛的社會，而從事於增進改革一個合理的幸福的社會生活。</p>
<p>這本書首先告訴了我們社會和人的關係，社會的日新月異是什麼意思——這裏面，它說明了社會的一切，是在或大或小的變動進步中；以及社會在日新月異中和人相爭的時代，至人類征服自然的時代；再說明了人類社會各時代各階段間的聯　性。</p>
<p>繼之，它解釋了社會發展的動力，以及資本主義與社會主義兩個世界的對照，解釋雖很簡單，但很正確。</p>
<p>接着，就講到中國是怎樣個社會了，作者指出了中國社會的落後性，無論在經濟方面文化方面的落後，作者都明白指出。關於中國社會發展的不平衡，以及其性質，作者也都有很明白的解說。</p>
<p>最後，在結論中，作者强調了中國社會的發展，是要建立起三民主義的新中國。</p>
<p>為了避免過多的贅疣，我只簡單地介紹了本書內容所述的槪要，不能引證原文來詳述內容。這一本書名「社會學入門」，名實相符，這是領我們去學習社會學的初步門徑。（姜君辰著文化供應社版）</p>
<h3>敎育哲學</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>林礪儒著　開明書店出版</p>
<p>近十餘年來，國內學者對於敎育哲學的研究，有三種顯然的不同的觀點。第一種是從哲學問題的派別的叙述，歸結到敎育的應用。目的在將哲學與敎育的關係，整理出一個系統，使敎育的實施可以得到哲學的依據。第二，再根據哲學的原理一一予以批判，看敎育的實施，是不是基於健全的哲學理論，一般人研究敎育原理多用此種方法。第三種是把敎育和哲學看做是一件事的兩方面，是混然一體不能截然分劃的。抱這種研究態度的人，特別强調敎育哲學和敎育實際經騐二者的聯縏。</p>
<p>實踐離不開理論</p>
<p>目前坊間已出版過的敎育哲學專著，都是根據上面所說的第一第二兩種觀點編寫而成。就第三種觀點，把理論和方法治於一爐，强調哲學和敎育兩者的聯縏，像這樣研究的人並不很多，更未見有專書問世。最近，我讀到林礪儒先生所著的「敎育哲學」，覺得很能滿足一般人的企求。</p>
<p>這是著者於一九四四年冬季倭寇連陷桂林柳州，隨桂林師範學院溯江人黔後所編成的一部講稿。除了三十三年九月世界出版的「敎育哲學講話」（傳統先著）外，林氏的書要算是國內僅有的敎育哲學的新著了。這書的特點，一言以蔽之，是思想有系統，有中心。在今日貧弱的出版界，確是一本值得推薦的好書。</p>
<p>迎向新的時代，應如何把握住進步的敎育哲學，以為敎育實施的前導，這是我們必須審愼考慮的。著者在本書第一講「　論」中，說明棄却哲學的思辯，而採實騐實證的態度，　　純經騐的科學的敎育學，是不可能的。因為敎育究非純粹的科學，必須要有健全的理論基礎，作實踐的　導，才不致走錯路向。「正確的哲學是從客觀的現實出發，從客觀的現實中探究其內在的法則」。這話是值得記取的。著者又提出敎育哲學的客觀性，實踐性，階級性和戰鬥性，他這樣給敎育哲學下了一個定義：「敎育哲學是從社會底生長，發展及其演變底必然的過程中探究形成於人間的客觀，法則底實踐哲學。」</p>
<p>本質</p>
<p>書中先就人類的生長看敎育的本質。敎育被認做人類社會的學習活動。生長是在勞動中，實踐中發展的。敎育又被看做社會作用，因為人類為了適應社會生活，不能離開敎育，社會生活過程必然發生敎育作用。</p>
<p>關於敎育的目的，一般人多放在外在的權職和高遠的成功上，與受敎育者的經騐生活間隔得太遠。然而敎育畢　是有目的的，因為敎育活動必須避免盲目的活動。我們應該「從全面的社會生活，看出無數的關係，無數的交互作用的力量，而隨時處都有可能改進人性底出發點，有許多可達目的底途徑。」</p>
<p>講到敎育的效能，著者先從敎育給被敎育者的作用說起，特別强調人類社會的文化環境對於人們心智發展的影響之大，　傳僅不過是一種可能的傾向，其發展仍決定於環境。敎育的效能是不可限量的，只要社會諸作用所發揮的敎育作用，能適合於敎育所應有的目的，而各種不同趨向的敎育作用，能在適宣於人性的發展的原則下彼此配合，敎育的效能便會顯示出來了。</p>
<p>方法</p>
<p>原理說過了，接着談到方法。敎育方法也就是實踐和學習活動的過程，從人類進化史可以看出人類社會的實踐過程中，到處都是敎育。杜威也不否認學習的實踐性。著者反復申述敎育方法和資料必須配合起來，若誤認方法為孤立的存生，則將陷唯心論的泥　。他說得很好：「方法實在是人們了解了自然變化的關聯，因而用來控制自然變化以求達到目的的底途徑。」關於學習方法，心理學的貢獻要算最大，他引用完形　心理學所提供的學習心理方式，在對於處境的「頓悟」。學習方法的優劣，全視學習者能否於特定的情境中，看出其與特定目的有關聯的細節。著者從這中間指明學習的困難或阻撓，是由於環境中各種相互關聯的細節，隱而未顯，而未易被人所把握。現象的複雜錯綜固然是一個原因，但大部分還是在於實踐的錯誤。眞誠面持久的實踐，是發見眞理的唯一方法，也是學習任何事物的唯一方法。</p>
<p>敎育研究的新趨向</p>
<p>把這本「敎育哲學」讀過一遍，一定會覺得敎育理論。著者所提示的敎育哲學，是基於辯證法的，對於敎育之社會的觀點，體認得極正確。在最後一講「現代敎育學演進之鳥瞰」中，又提到四個很有價值的論斷：如（一）敎育學所要研究的，不限於有形的學校敎育的設施，要把敎育看做人格生長的過程，社會生長發展的過程。（二）敎育學的基礎，要擴展到各種文化科學，取資於一切科學。（三）敎育學的地位不止於應用科學，須發展至獨立的有自己立塲的具有自律性的科學。（四）敎育學的研究，要超越於原理與方法，進而在社會生長發展的轉變中，探索個性成長的法則，—則闡明歷史的社會的敎育現象的法則。</p>
<h3>家庭敎育</h3>
<p>— 蕭傳文</p>
<p>陳鶴琴著　華華書店出版</p>
<p>本書顯著的特點是將兒童心理與敎育的專門學問用淺顯明白的事例說明解釋，裏面所提出的問題，都是每個父母所遭遇到的，也是每個父母所需要獲得解答的。</p>
<p>國內敎育家所寫關於兒童敎育的書頗不乏專著善本，但是將專門學理寓於淺鮮的具體事例而加以闡揚發揮，使讀者不感到是在看書，或是在聽演講，那麼陳先生這本書可算是不可多得的了。全書共二百二十餘頁，文長不過三十萬字，可是所包括的內容材料之豐富，幾乎是　　翔　，字字珠　。使讀者一面讀着，一面覺得好像坐在一個敎育家的實騐室裏，參觀他對兒童的敎導和愛撫。作者研究的主要對象，是自己的子女兩人，　亦舉友人的子女為例，以兒童敎育家兼慈父的態度，可是站在客觀的地位加以熱情的敎導和冷靜的觀察，所以學生來的實例，十分親切近人，趣味橫　。</p>
<p>作者首先舉出兒童心理之特性，而喚起讀者注意兒童因各種心理狀態之發展，而有各種體隨而來的行為發生，乃需要何種的敎育方式加以指導。如兒童的天性是好模仿好奇的，做父母者不僅要懂得這種天性是好的，是兒童求知識的鎖鑰，而且心須進而循循善誘，引導他走上正當廣大的路上去養成他對外界事物的追求研究的精神。又如兒童是好　的，父母就應該使兒童有遊伴玩侶，參加　　生活，發揮他樂　的天性。</p>
<p>作者更說明兒童學習的　　原則，由於兒童天賦有三種本　的能力，即感覺，聯念，和動作之逐步發展生長，所以實施敎育即當依具心理發展的階段而施以適當的敎育，兒童的學習，是先感受外界的刺激，然後將所感到的事物和所有的感覺聯合起來，再發生相當的動作，去反應外界的刺激。這個學習的基本原則，實包括全部兒童敎育的中心思想和原理。作者即根據這個原理，闡揚發揮，應用之於兒童日常生活的動作和行為上去，敎育實施的全部原理，即以此為圭臬。而作者更能將這個原理用淺鮮明白的事例，加以反復說明解釋。使讀者心領神會，一目瞭然，這一點如果不是作者自己身體力行，將自己投入兒童的領域裏去，加以精密客觀的研究和觀察，是萬萬做不到的，道點也許是本書最大的特色。</p>
<p>根據上面所說的兒童學習的基本原則出發，作者特別使讀者注意，為父母者應該予兒童以適當的刺激，使有優良的環境，一方面指導兒童所發生的反應，糾正其錯誤，一方面須鞏固兒童所有的聯念，使之發為有效的作為</p>
<p>也許有人認為本書嫌平凡瑣屑，所叙都是老生常談之事。不錯，家庭敎育的對象是活潑天眞的兒童，它的本身就是千變萬化，瞬息不同。試問用條例式的原理原則來說明它好呢？還是用實際具體的事例來說明它好？本書最可賣的一點，就是在乎作都在日常生活中，臨時隨地注意觀察，督導指示所進得來的活生生的實例和經騐，這些　例和經騐，可以用敎育上的原理原則却不一定完全可以規範限制這些例證，換言之，本書的例證是從天眞活潑的兒童身上得來的，而不是些空泛死板的理論。總之，這本書不是學校敎室裏的說敎，不是學者專家的演講，它是用活潑生動的文筆描寫凡平有趣的日常事例。學校敎師可用此書作敎育學科的課本，家庭父母可用此書作敎育子女的實鑑。筆者與陳先生素不認識，無意故作宣傳，可是願一般父母都人手一册，看看它所告訴你的，準是你日夜所企望獲得解答的。</p>
<h3>「飛躍的人們」</h3>
<p>— 遠人</p>
<p>江鍶編譯　中華書局出版</p>
<p>在紙貴洛陽的現階段，兒童讀物和少年讀物，似乎不再像前些年頭那樣蓬勃和有生氣，這是反映着兒童文學逐漸沒落，銷沉；這對少年本身或是出版界，都是損失。</p>
<p>最近我們很感興奮的看到江總編譯的「飛躍的人們」，正如魏冰心在序裏所說：「自然這不是怎麼樣偉大的作品，可是比較時下粗製濫造東抄西要的劣貨，至少要高一籌。」這是老實話。全書輯譯的故事以科學家，敎育家，以及時代偉人，充滿着積極·前進·樂觀·解放的中心思想。對於某一個成功者，它並沒有盡着說敎的任務，只是以文學的輕鬆活潑的筆調，告訴着年輕的一代，以怎樣成功的軌跡，刻劃着暗示奮鬥制服環境的事實。朱翊新在序裏說：「我們把人類活躍的故事，去給少年們作精神食糧，無疑的應當選擇這些材料」，我很同意他的話，同時也為少年們慶幸。</p>
<p>我現在正是一個少年，我想每個人都該珍貴他的少年時代，這是一册鼓勵振奮你刻苦努力飛躍起來的書。是人和環境奮鬥勝利的書。深願向少年以及家長們推荐。</p>
<h3>評「夜戲」</h3>
<p>— 鏗鏘</p>
<p>（聶紺弩著　改進出版社版）</p>
<p>聶紺弩先生是以雜文著稱的，他的雜文尖刻有力，頗帶一點「魯迅風」。本來我總覺得一個寫雜文的人是不適宜於寫小說的，以為那種尖刻的筆調對小說多少有點格格不入，但是當我看完了這本「夜戲」以後，我的觀念却完全改變了，我知道了一個寫雜文的人是也適宜於寫小說的，而尤其是短篇小說。</p>
<p>「夜戲」中包含有五個短篇，自然這五個短篇都是有份量的，不像有些短篇小說的作家，往往喜歡在幾　好的短篇中夾上一二篇壞的，像豬肉攤上賣肉配骨頭一樣。這裏的五個短篇中，有兩篇是寫抗戰期間四川旅途中的景物。兩篇寫政工人員的工作情形，一篇寫敵後的簡單故事。</p>
<p>一般的說來，「夜戲」中幾篇寫景的以寫情的成功，如第一篇「酒船」就是一個很好的例子，這裏作者差不多像在繪圖畫一樣，把長江上游一帶的景物全都給繪了出來，從這裏我們可以看到空氣　悶的酒船，酒船像是一家小烟紙店，貨架上擺有五顏六色的香烟，緊挨着貨架子的是一張案板，上面擺着酒瓶·茶碗·鹹菜·油麫等。案板當頭是一個正煮着什麼的炭爐子，靠另外一邊擺着兩張方桌和板凳,幾個人坐在那裏擺龍門陣。像這種景象對於一個到過四川的人眞是太熟悉了，也太能引起人們的回憶了。</p>
<p>不過在另一篇當中聶先生的眞情還是成功的，那就是最末一篇的「弟弟」，這裏他安排了兩個悲劇的角色，一個是要强的要面子的，而也要國家的哥哥；另一個是受了罪惡的社會所引誘，自甘墮落的弟弟。做哥哥的心裏有着千萬種的矛盾，當他從遠地方回到家裏，看到家徒四壁，看到像乞丐似的弟弟時，他的心裏是非常惱恨的，為什麼一個靑年人會墮落到如此地步呢？但是當他轉念一想，想起站在面前的是自己的同胞兄弟，又想到當時的社會委實腐敗得使靑年人不能自制時，他又原諒他的弟弟了。他表示只要弟弟肯聽他的話，改掉那些自甘墮落的　氣，他可以帶着他出門去，給他找事做，給他討媳婦。然而到結果呢？哥哥的希望是落了空。一個自願跳河的人是拉不到岸上來的。由於這一篇可以使我們連帶想起意大利作家哥維尼·彼伯尼的那篇「敗家子」（Prodigal　son）來，不過「敗家子」中的主角後來是悔悟的，「弟弟」中的主角却終於越陷越深地沒入了泥淖之中。這是一個喜劇和悲劇的分別，雖然我們不能說聶紺弩先生的作品能超過哥維尼·彼伯尼，但是不使彼伯尼專美於先這一點終算做得到的。</p>
<p>和「弟弟」可以媲美的是「夜戲」這一篇，這裏刻劃出了一個小資產階級的女性，她是鄉長的小姐，她很想幹救亡工作；但是却又討論厭和一羣「庸俗」的鄉下人在一起混。她有少女的矜持；但却又相信戀愛在生活中比工作重要。這種女性在中國是很多的，在戰時，我們又幾曾看到一個吃好穿好的小資產階級女性參與救亡工作呢？喊口號或許是她們的能事，但實際工作却是那些樸素的，帶點泥土氣的鄉下人在那裏幹。</p>
<p>根據內容來說，這是一本現實主義的短篇小說，五篇中差不多沒有一點幻想的影子。本來末，在目前這麼一個時代裏，一切都在岌岌可危地動搖着，作為一個作家的，又憑藉什麼可以抹起良心來，寫一些花花草草的消閒文章來粉飾太平洋呢？</p>
<h3>介紹蔡著刑法學</h3>
<p>— 廷光</p>
<p>（刑法學，蔡樞衡書，定價六元，獨立出版社印行。）</p>
<p>淸代末葉，由於外來因素而引起的社會經濟的變動，中國的法學跟着也走上了新的途徑。然而，幾十年來，中國法學方面，關於刑法學的部份，不一味對西洋著作作單純形式的模做；而能對中國歷史社會作深刻的探討；由作者個人積極構成體系的著作却很少見！直至最近我們才得讀到一本令人滿意的書：就是這蔡著刑法學的第一編。</p>
<p>全書共分五章：第一章刑法學，第二章刑法想想，第三章刑法，第四章中國刑法，第五章刑法在法律體系中的地位。他不僅概念：並能儘量的反映社會現實，充分發揮他個人的思想與見解。在第二章叙述中國刑法思想之發展一節裏，對前人的稅法，展開了嚴正的批判。根據他個人對中國歷史社會背景觀察研究的結果，給我們獻出了中國刑法將來應走的一條路！在第四章中國明日刑法之合理形態一節裏，審　無限的希望。</p>
<p>他在這本書裏提出了些獨到的見解例如：宣統二年頒行的大淸新刑律，普通都認為是屬於科學時期的刑法的類型，但他却指出大淸新的刑律的頒行是中國進入次殖民地的開端，是中國次殖民性的反映。其他類此的精闢之論還很多。</p>
<p>綜觀全書，我們可發現作　的一貫方針是企圖融會刑法總則與刑法分則，貫通理論與實踐，一方面運用過程；一方面從法律體系中把握刑法的全體，藉以顯示刑法在國家社會生活秩序中的地位，並治法律觀，方法論與倫理學於一爐，用以增進刑法學的哲學性與科學性。可惜文字稍嫌艱澀，讀起來頗為吃力，但在尙在萌芽時期的刑法學中確是一部前所未有的好書。茲特作誠懇的介紹，並希望蔡先生即速履行他在自序中所告訴我們的準備寫而未寫的第二編，第三編，使其早日問世，期能在目前著作貧乏的法學上添些生氣，提供些進步見解。</p>

<h3>失學與失業</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>暑假剛剛開始，一般學生和他們家長，已經在憂慮　暑假以後是不是能擔負得起那一筆龐大的學費了。</p>
<p>最近學校往往巧立名目，榨取學生的費用，尤其是私立學校，個人辦了一個學校，好像開設了一家銀行，那些學生就是「銀行老　」（校長）榨取的對象，什麼校舍建築費，老師進修費，捐毀公物的補償費，童軍服裝費，……說不淸一大套。一到開學，學校收進偌大一筆財產，於是利上滾利，校長先生　了總經理，校長太太成了會計主任兼出納，學生變成了「貨品」。校長愛怎麼辦，就怎麼辦。</p>
<p>這種為了「發洋財」而辦學校的人到處可見，幷不是我們過份誇大其事。</p>
<p>為着物價的波動，為着生活的不安，這些私立學校的費用，下學期開列的繳費項目，一定將使一般中下層階級的子女被踢出校門以外。</p>
<p>據估計，一個私立中學，下學期最少將繳納二百萬以上，一個私立大學，更是不可想像。</p>
<p>為着市立　國立學校費用較廉，單以北平一地而言，每一所市立中學報名的已到達六千人，而市立學校的額制才二百人，請問這許多學生將如何安揷！？</p>
<p>上海是全國學生最多的地方，如若當局不事先預為安置，他們在學團裏成為失學的學生，在社會上，他們將成為失業份子。</p>
<p>據數月前的估計，上海失業人數已有二百萬人以上；現在這些無學業，無職業的靑年，如若眞正由學校裏退出來，你可以想像得到它所造成的嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>失學在承平時期本來不是一件可怕的事情，但在此時此地，學校容不了他們，社會更無法使他們就業，這些靑年們，他們徬徨街頭，將怎麼辦？</p>
<p>在這裏，我們不必提出什麼具體的辦法，但希望當局能够未雨綢繆，事先替他們想條出路！</p>

<h3>中蒙界約</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>新疆北塔山事件發生後，我國提出了抗議；同時我國承認的蒙古人民共和國亦提出了反抗議，中蒙邊界問題於是引起了世人的注意。</p>
<p>政府提出二次抗議，同時集合各方專家研究，來日中蒙邊境界約及其劃定上，必有一番强烈的爭辯，從這次北塔山事件上可以證明，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>訂立界約，在糊裏糊塗不知不覺中失去廣大地域的，在歷史上，恐怕要算淸代中俄的歷次界約。自一八五八年（咸豐八年）愛　條約後，一八六〇年（咸豐十年）的北京條約，一八六四年（同治三年）的塔城界約，一八六九年（同治八年）的科布多界約，一八七〇年（同治九年）的塔爾巴哈台界約，一八八二年（光緒八年）的伊犁界約及喀什噶爾東北界約，一八八三年（光緒九年）的科布多界約及塔爾巴哈台界約，一八八四年（光緒十年）的喀什噶爾西北界約。每一勘界，每一界約，無不暗中削地，這種削地，都在不知不覺之間，我們不能不嘆着當時主持者的太缺乏地理知識。</p>
<p>報傳蘇軍進駐塔城，消息尙未證實。但我們不能不想起一八七一年（同治十年）俄軍藉口占領伊犁的故事。惟當時的帝俄，尙聲稱為「中國收復伊犁，俟新疆定後，即行交還」。待淸廷抗議，又聲稱「俄政府無意併合，待中國威令能行於此方，可以保國境之安全時，即當退還云」。</p>
<p>未來的中蒙界約，糾紛必多，我們想起了淸代中俄歷次界約無保的損失國土，更想起了淸代交涉收回伊犁的失敗無能的　厚與挽回權益的曾紀澤。再看了壁上掛着地圖上的蒙古新疆與東九省的顏色。我們這個民族，再不奮起自强是來不及了。</p>
<p>中蒙邊境及其界約，政府集合專家研究，非特必要，而且必須加强才行！</p>
<h3>閒話稿費</h3>
<p>— 柳惲</p>
<p>寫文章以易稿費，其事不自今日始。只是時至今日，謀生之道萬端，沒有更拙於文人以腦汁做資本的「生計」了。工人的薪給，尙可仗生活指數每月調整，文人的酬報，又安能「道」與「魔」競呢？</p>
<p>稿費舊稱「　筆」，本「德潤身，富潤屋」之意。其「潤」止於筆，可謂取不傷廉。實則筆記小說所載，前代文士「潤筆」之巨，有令人咋舌者。宋洪進客　隨筆：「文士潤筆，自　宋以來即有之，至　始　；　　作文，受納饋遺巨萬；皇甫湜為裴度作福先寺碑，贈車馬綵　甚厚，湜猶以為薄，度又酬絹九千匹。白居易作元　墓志，謝以鞍馬駿帛玉帶，價踰六七十萬。裴均死，其子持萬　詣韋貫之求鉻。」唐代人對於身後之名，十分重視，孝子賢孫，非求「如椽之籍」為父祖寫墓志碑文不可。文士如不藉之苛索，亦不足以明身價之高。「饋遺巨萬」當時是成為風氣的。唐史：「製度條爾先寺；將求碑文於白居易，湜不平，乃使為文，飲酣，援筆立就。」這樣的「急就章」，還要嫌報酬少，而裴相國則居然還一次加贈九千匹絹，皇甫湜可謂貪得無厭了。</p>
<p>「起襄公」韓愈，當時專為達官貴人寫墓誌銘，稿費收入極豐，劉禹錫祭韓昌黎文曰：「公一字之價，　金如山。」可證。他的弟子劉文，某日看見昌黎案頭朱提纍纍，乃道：「此阿諛墓中人之所得，不如與我吃酒。」遂逕自携去，劉文的順手牽羊，可謂對老師濫收稿費的一種幽默抗議！</p>
<p>宋元以降，潤筆就難期巨萬；中吳紀聞：「　門之西，有姚民素以孝稱，所居有三瑞堂，東坡嘗為賦詩。姚致香為憲，坡不受。與友人書云：「姚君篤善好事，其意極可嘉，然不須以物見遺，惠香八十罐，却託還之，已領其厚意，與收留無異，實為他相　所　皆不敢留故也」。云云。足微坡老為人作詩文，是不收　筆之資的，淸　如此，勝巴黎多矣。</p>
<p>明代唐寅　中常　巨帙；掇錄所撰文詞，顏曰「利市」，可見解元公作文章，不僅想弄稿費，而且想「多多益善」了。</p>
<p>淸代袁子才的詩文，是非銀不出的；七絕一首，銀五十兩，律則倍之，有人求在隨　詩話中掛個名字，就得奉白銀百兩為壽。俞機賣文的潤格亦頗高，不滿千字者五十兩，千字以上者倍。有詩云：「公鼎俟碑價不貲，如余　陋豈相宜？只　竊據名山席，遂使爭求下里詞；敢以再三心厭倦，奈因七十力衰　，餘　雖有高人笑，此意區區　諒之。」　懷謙抱，使人見詩。</p>
<p>這種以小詩冠於「潤格」之　，似創自鄭板橋，板橋潤格係賣　，茲不贅。民國以來，海上人文　集，潤格小詩有絕仕者。無錫王西神蘊章在世時賣文海上，曾題有潤格小詩云：「　墨磨人不自聊，秋心卷盡雪中　。家風慚愧紅　換，潤筆親　學板橋。」意象　秀，想見其人。至於早經下世的計指嚴先生，自　潤格詩云：「海上蹉跎二十年，醉舒白眼看靑天，兎　脫盡身垂老，換得人間賣命錢。」窮愁鬱抑之情，溢於褚墨之外，文人今日讀之，怕更有「抑又下矣」之歎吧！</p>
<h3>胡蝶在新片「春之夢」中之一個塲面</h3>

<h3>電荒聲中談水電建設</h3>
<p>— 亞</p>
<p>電之對於工業，猶如水之對於人生一樣重要。這幾天本市又鬧着電荒，徐家匯二百餘家廠商發出緊急呼籲，要求供電，否則數萬工人之失業，如何解決？這個問題對整個上海還是一個小問題，但際此國家多事之秋，大量消耗電（現發十八萬瓩，戰前容量為廿六萬瓩。）的上海，若光是都靠煤來發電，工業的危機始終存在。</p>
<p>挪威的地方無煤藏，但多由陵瀑布，因利用水電，平均發電量冠於全球。英國工業用電，靠煤，水電很少，（英格蘭僅廿四萬瓩）假使你不曾健忘的話，上年冬，大雪淹沒了他們的鐵道，用煤大起恐荒，幸空軍出動，危機始得倖免。</p>
<p>所以上海的用電，為未雨綢繆計，必須儘量的想法用水電來解放一部份。比如長江三陜蘊藏在一千萬瓩以上，且西可輸至成都，東可至京滬一帶，可惜需工程費三四十億美元之巨，致　迫棄置。杭州錢塘江，七里瀧等地，若經費有着，半年至一年內可完成，發電量在十五萬瓩以上，可以供輸京滬一帶，最近據說政府派員在勘測中。說到這裏，不禁想起上海等大理的富商巨資，何必沉迷於黃金，美鈔，作非法的投機？</p>
<p>他們如能為水電建設貢獻一部份財力，人民得到的利益，是不可想像的。</p>
<p>最近據翁委員長報告，全國水電量九十萬瓩（包括東北二十萬瓩，東北蘊藏量松花江一七〇萬瓩，　絲江一六〇萬瓩，台灣十八萬瓩，台灣蘊藏量在三三〇瓩以上，）美國現有五千萬瓩，中國的水電百分之六十以上屬於資委會，可見人民對此不十分注意。中國可能像挪威，像美國，可是國家無多錢，因此飛瀑流泉，亦不過供人欣賞而已。在擬建中的福州閩江，可利用以與起該地的工業；江西贛江計劃中的K．V．A．，四川都江堰中央擬七億元在進行中，預料完成後可先發電二萬五千瓩；廣東的珠江，將由美國某公司投資，成立珠江水電廠；西康的康定河，蘊藏量在十五萬瓩以上，足够全省之用，如完成後，該省同胞就有國內最廉之電，從事生產，經費擬向法國銀團貸款補助。奉化的雪寶山，亦有人注意修建中。其他像雁宕，石梁，　　等飛瀑，喧怕　震，萬馬奔騰，有崩落千尺之勢，希望他們在最近將來，能被　服，為當地大放光明，為人民謀幸福。</p>
<h3>桑維翰的鐵硯</h3>
<p>— ��人</p>
<p>小時候在私孰中讀書，記得祖父買給我用的一塊有漆盒子蓋的硯池一方，鳥光光的，上面刻了「磨穿鐵硯」四個隸書的金子，這四個字給我很深的印象，當時心裏曾想過，這塊硯明明是石的為什麼硬說是鐵的呢？那時見了長輩就害怕，又不敢問個究竟，一直悶在心里。</p>
<p>及至於到了自己也會用典故寫文章的時候，方纔明白凡是能致力於學，矢志不移，而　有所成的，呌做「　穿鐵硯」。當時也還是知其當然而不知其所以然。再進一步到了自己能翻譯二十四史的時候了，這才更澈底明白這方鐵硯的來頭，並不出於什麼了不起的聖堅，而實出於一位非常卑鄙的桑維翰。</p>
<p>桑維翰為石敬瑭草表稱臣於契丹主，且請以父禮事之。石敬瑭兒皇帝的雅號，原來就是在他計劃下造成的。當時雖有在一旁的劉知遠苦勸石敬瑭道：「稱巨可矣，以父事之太過；厚以金帛賂之，自定致其兵；不必許以土田，恐異日大為中國之患，悔之無及。」但只知信任桑維翰的石敬瑭那裏肯聽呢？於是兒皇帝做成了，燕雲十六州也完全奉送給異族了。</p>
<p>五代史桑維翰傳：「維翰初　進士，主司惡其姓，以為桑喪同音，人有勸從佗求仕者，維翰慨然，乃鑄鐵硯以示人曰：「硯敝，則改而佗仕。」卒以進士及第。」</p>
<p>桑維翰的決心走所謂「正途」，當然是有志之士，像後來　書人努力求科名，要在塲屋中以文章出人頭地，「十年寒窗無人問，一舉成名天下知」，這自然是有出息人幹的事，誰曰不宜。</p>
<p>但可惜的是「只為功名方讀書」的傳統思想害了他，他雖然終於出了頭，做了大官，然而却不免在靑史上留下了也磨不穿的魏名。當年力主引契丹入晋的桑維翰，且竟以此還死於契丹主子的手中，這眞呌做引狼入室，作繭自縛的可憐虫啊！</p>
<p>我因此想到「臨池白首學為人」的今人詩句，究竟比古人「臨池白首學為官」的可憐虫高明多了。因為那些「磨穿鐵硯」的可憐虫，不但自身做了可憐虫而已，甚至還連累到世世代代的子孫，都不免於做可憐虫，這才眞正白費了「磨穿鐵硯」的苦工夫哩！</p>
<p>寄語桑維翰的　讀人及早覺悟回頭吧。</p>

<h3>The Prelude to the Great Annihilation War Begins: National Revolutionary Army of Shandong Recovers Yishui, Communist Army of Jiaodong Levies Grain to Transport to Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 9th] The great annihilation war in Southern Shandong has begun. The National Revolutionary Army, moving north along the Yi River, recovered Yishui on the afternoon of the 8th. This not only completely cut off the Communist bandits retreating to the Yunmeng Mountain area from their supply line to Zhucheng, but also completely trapped the main force of 120,000 Communist bandits, who had scattered to Qingtuo Temple, Duozhuang, Feixian, and Jiehe areas, within the pocket formed by Yishui, Linyi, Sishui, Mengyin, and Donglidian, which are encircling them. This is indeed a rare and easily lost opportunity for the National Revolutionary Army to annihilate the main force of the Communist East China Field Army. Strategically, the National Revolutionary Army has already taken an absolutely advantageous position. Furthermore, the main force of the Communist bandits is concentrated in a small mountainous area, where water and food are extremely difficult to obtain, which is also sufficient to deliver a death blow to the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Linyi, 9th] The fighting on the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains is fierce and intensifying. After four days and nights of encirclement and fierce fighting by the National Revolutionary Army, over 20,000 Communist troops from four columns, who had been rampaging around Qingtuo Temple and Tangtou Town, were annihilated. In addition, the Communist forces besieging Feixian have increased to three columns. Although they entered the city walls on the evening of the 7th, they have fallen into a counter-encirclement by the National Revolutionary Army and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 9th] The National Revolutionary Army, which attacked Gaomi from Jiaoxian, officially recovered Gaomi city before noon on the 9th. The Communist army suffered casualties reaching one battalion. In the afternoon of the 9th, the National Revolutionary Army is continuing to mop up the remaining forces to the west.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zaxian, 9th] The National Revolutionary Army at Linyong retreated towards Changle on the 7th after completing their mission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] The Communist bandits in Jiaodong have recently been levying large amounts of civilian grain in Muping, Fushan, Haiyang, and other places, transporting it to Yantai, and shipping it to Dalian. The first batch of 10,000 tons of grain was shipped to Datong by two Soviet ships carrying 3,000 tons each, in two batches on the 15th of last month. The second batch of 7,000 tons of barley has been gathered in Yantai awaiting shipment.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 9th] (1) Lingshan was originally occupied by the 6th Guard Brigade of the Beihai Independent 1st Regiment of the Communist Army. Now, more than 10,000 men from the New 1st Division and others have been transferred from Yantai and are gathering in the Lingshan and Yinbolan areas, with the intention of invading the outskirts of Qingdao. The National Revolutionary Army is on strict alert. (2) The fighting on the outskirts of Weixian is calm, and a second battle is brewing. (3) Zhilanzhuang, between Jiaoxian and Gaomi, was attacked by 2,000 Communist troops last night, attempting to cut off the National Revolutionary Army's rear. They were bravely repelled by the defending troops and fled north.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 9th] The war in Western Shandong has become stable. The attempt of Liu Bocheng's troops, who had been harassing Heze, to flee south and cut off the Longhai Railway was completely crushed by the timely arrival of National Revolutionary Army reinforcements. The Communist army, unable to flee south to Laiwu, turned to bypass Wenshang with its main force and harass the outskirts of Ningyang. At the same time, the 8th Column of Chen Yi's forces, which had been fleeing west from Tusikou, also attacked Tai'an city after capturing Zhonggong on the 7th. In order to take the initiative, the National Revolutionary Army in the city voluntarily abandoned the city walls on the night of the 7th. In addition, the 3rd and 10th Columns of Chen Yi's forces, originally based in Zibo, and the Communist army on the north bank of the Yellow River, also attacked and harassed the area around Mingshui, Puji, and Yancheng. In order to maneuver, the National Revolutionary Army voluntarily retreated to the line of Longshan, Jieshou, Feicheng, Guyang, Qihe, and Sangdiandian on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 9th] A portion of over 5,000 men from the 6th Column of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces fiercely attacked Qingze on the 7th. The defending troops bravely counterattacked and repelled them on the morning of the 8th. Around Jixiang and Juye, approximately 20,000 men from the 2nd and 3rd Columns of the Communist bandits infiltrated on the night of the 7th. The National Revolutionary Army is blocking them and fierce fighting is underway. Caoxian was captured by over a thousand bandits on the night of the 7th.</p>
<h3>National Revolutionary Army of Hebei Closes in on Renqiu: Troops on the Rehe Front Advance Towards Both Sides of Beipiao; Soviet Aircraft Fly Over the Yalu River</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 9th] The National Revolutionary Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway bypassed Zhengzhou last night and closed in on Renqiu. The main force of the Communist army collapsed and fled upon hearing the news. The National Revolutionary Army in Eastern Hebei continued to mop up towards Sanhe.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 9th] The battle situation on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has come to an end. Nie Rongzhen's troops are gathering between Wanxian, Tangxian, Mancheng, and Yixian to reorganize.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The main force of the National Revolutionary Army on the Rehe front crossed the Daling River from near Jinlingsi in three routes on the 8th, attacking towards both sides of Beipiao. They had reached Luotuo Yingzi before noon and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 9th] The 3rd and 13th Brigades and an independent regiment, plus the 5th County Detachment, totaling approximately 7,000 men, of the Communist bandits attacking Pingquan, have been relentlessly attacking the city walls for over ten days. The National Revolutionary Army has resolutely defended and inflicted heavy blows on them. At present, the bandits, with over half of their forces killed or wounded, have exhausted their offensive and appear to be retreating.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 8th] According to unconfirmed sources from the government side: "A certain army" of 1,000 men has arrived in Wafangdian from Dalian and established an advanced command post. According to refugees who escaped from Andong: Soviet soldiers are stationed on the Yalu River Bridge. The Communist army in Andong has sealed off all factories, and most shops in the city are also closed.</p>
<p>[China News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] The National Revolutionary Army south of Dashiqiao swept towards Gaiping along the Zhongchang Railway on the 6th. They encountered Communist resistance near Lanqichang and fierce fighting broke out. The Communist bandits were completely defeated, and the National Revolutionary Army captured several train cars full of machinery and materials. The remnants fled towards Gaiping.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Four United Offices to Discuss the Treatment of Employees of Various National Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] Premier Zhang believes that the treatment of employees of various national banks is much higher than that of public education personnel, which is unfair. He ordered the Four United Offices to convene relevant agencies to discuss how to reduce the gap. The office convened a meeting at noon on the 9th to discuss this in detail.</p>
<h3>The Beitashan Incident Remains Unresolved: Outer Mongolian Army Continues to Harass, Repeatedly Attacks Baiyangou but is Repelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 8th] Qitai News: Since our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with Outer Mongolia regarding the Beitashan incident, our troops, in addition to securing their positions, have hoped that this matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. However, for more than a month, the Mongolian army, except for a slight retreat in the early stages of the incident due to criticism from world opinion, has continued to harass us from time to time in order to contain the actions of our National Revolutionary Army in Xinjiang. Its purpose clearly has broad political significance. At around 9 p.m. on June 26th, over 300 Outer Mongolian cavalry attacked our Usman troops south of Huzhi'erte (northern foothills of Beitashan). Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 27th, when they were defeated and retreated. At 3 p.m. on the 28th, a twin-engine fighter plane flew over our positions to reconnoiter and strafed with machine guns. At dawn on July 3rd, over 300 Mongolian cavalry attacked our Baiyangou (northern foothills of Beitashan). After fierce fighting, they retreated towards the southeast of the Baiyangou front at 2 p.m. During the fighting, one light bomber and one heavy bomber flew in to assist in the battle, dropping many bombs and strafing at low altitude. Nomadic civilians and livestock in our rear area were killed or injured. At 9 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, the Mongolian army attacked our Baiyangou positions again.

<h3>U.S. Congressman Judd Calls for Aid to China, Praises Chairman Chiang for His Far-Sighted Vision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] U.S. Congressman Judd urged the United States to provide greater assistance to China immediately when meeting with reporters today. Commenting on Chiang’s July 6th broadcast, Judd said: "Chairman Chiang told the people of the country that 'if the whole country does not unite to suppress the rebellion, the entire country will be lost.' This statement will prove to be correct in future history." Judd said that Chairman Chiang has a far-sighted vision. He has been aware of it in other countries for a long time. He had already foreseen the ambition of Japanese military aggression, just as he sees the scourge of the Communist Party today. Chairman Chiang never tolerates any country. He opposed Japanese aggression from the beginning. Chairman Chiang tried to reach a political solution with the Communist Party, but the latter made it impossible. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has no choice but to fight the Communist Party to the end, and he is well aware of all the difficulties he has encountered. Judd criticized the United States and other allies for abandoning China in a crisis and said, "Chairman Chiang must rise up to resist the encroachment of evil, just as he rose up to resist Japan in 1937." Judd said: "The United States' policy towards China is very short-sighted. The United States has procrastinated with communism and even promoted its formation. He said that the United States should immediately provide China with assistance, especially since China was an ally of the United States in the war and undoubtedly saved the lives of 100,000 American soldiers?</p>
<h3>The Crisis of World War III is More Serious in the Far East than in Europe: Speech by Sir Bland</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 9th] Sir Bland gave a speech on "The Current Situation in China" at the Overseas Building last night to a large audience, in which he made a predictive abandonment of his views, saying that the outbreak of World War III is more seriously dangerous in the Far East than in Europe. When he criticized the Yalta agreement regarding Northeast China, he said: "For the past hundred years, the Northeast has been the site of competition between Japan and Russia, and the final outcome between the two countries is unavoidable. Now that Japan has been defeated, Soviet Russia is confronting the United States in the Far East." Sir Bland praised Chinese culture, calling it one of the greatest achievements in history. Other empires built on force rose and eventually collapsed, but China still exists. Today, this ancient political system has become the past, and China is now struggling to find a new political system. In this country, where villages are the units of republican political systems, the experiment of establishing a centralized government has not been successful. Sir Bland further said: "I greatly admire the Chinese people, and I am an admirer of Chinese culture. I love the Chinese people and love their shortcomings, but I think that recognizing the shortcomings of the Chinese people is harmful and useless to them." When asked whether the Chinese language is an obstacle to the unification of China, he replied: The fact is just the opposite of what is asked. Chinese characters are a factor in uniting China. Although Chinese is difficult for foreigners to learn, it is more beautiful, more expressive, and more freely usable than other alphabets. Answering another question, Sir Bland said: China's economic situation is indeed very bad. There have been very few industrialization plans since the war, and its current export business is very small compared to before the war. However, China has just suffered a very kind of experience, and he is deeply convinced that China has not lost its ability to reverse the situation.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan to Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Cooperation with Mobilization Work</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] After the General Mobilization Bill was made public, the Control Yuan is making various preparations to strengthen the supervisory work to cooperate with the recruitment of personnel. The Control Yuan is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 9th, at which this matter may be discussed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] On the 8th, the reporter encountered President Yu Youren at the external public memorial ceremony for Yang Guangxing. When asked about the progress of this general mobilization case, Yu pointed out that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the results of the victory have been reduced due to the Communist Party's division and interference, construction has been unable to proceed, and the people's livelihood has fallen into extreme pain and panic. At this point, it is necessary to remove all obstacles to peaceful construction and overcome all environmental difficulties. Peace, democracy, and unification are inseparable. Without unification, there is no peace and democracy. I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will pursue this goal together.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] All parts of the country have universally expressed their support for the government's call for general mobilization to suppress bandits and implement constitutional government. On the 8th, those who expressed their support to the government included the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, the Rongxi Sichuan Postal Service Association, the Sichuan Municipal News Reporters Association, the Changchun Municipal Temporary Assembly, the Guizhou Provincial Assembly, the Commercial Federation, the Henan Nanyang County Assembly, the Shanxi Provincial Temporary Assembly, the Ningxia Assembly, and various mass organizations. On the 8th, the Taiwan Provincial All Circles Public Memorial Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War and the Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster specially donated 100 million national currency and telegraphed it to the Ministry of National Defense, requesting it to comfort the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 9th] Qihua Telephone: The military and civilians here were very excited to learn that the central government has issued the General Mobilization Order, and they all believe that it is time to suppress the rebellion and defend against insults. They quickly notified the troops guarding Beitashan of this news.</p>
<h3>Chunhua and Other Counties in Northern Shaanxi Implement a Scorched Earth Policy in the Cauldron-Shaped Area and Implement a Village Consolidation and Immigration Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 9th] In the old cauldron-shaped area of Chunhua, Yaoxian, Yijun, and other counties in northern Shaanxi, the military authorities believe that the area has ravines and complicated terrain, with many mountains and little land, sparse residents, and frequent appearances of traitors and bandits, making it difficult to clear them out. Therefore, it is recommended that the Shaanxi Provincial Government implement a scorched earth policy in this area and completely transform it. The Provincial Government has decided to implement a village consolidation and immigration plan, ordering the residents in the area to move to designated locations outside the area and concentrate. The original area is designated as a restricted area, destroying roads and not allowing residents to re-enter to live and cultivate. However, the government will provide migration fees and allocate housing and arable land at the centralized location. The total cost is 200 million yuan. The Provincial Government will allocate it to the special commissioner's office in the area at one time for overall planning and distribution. The Malanzhen Beauty Post Office, which was temporarily established after the liberation, will be canceled at the same time, and the old jurisdiction area will be returned to the jurisdiction of the respective county governments.</p>
<h3>The Information Bureau Establishes an Office in the Ancient City</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 9th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan has established an office in Beiping. The location has been determined to be the former German Embassy in Dongjiaomin Lane. This office is scheduled to be reorganized from the North China Office of the International Propaganda Department. The organizational regulations and budget are being drafted.</p>
<h3>The Political Consultative Conference Becomes a Historical Term; The Organization of its Secretariat is Announced to be Terminated</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] The "Political Consultative Conference," an organization established to unite various parties to discuss national affairs, is now deemed unnecessary to exist. Therefore, the name of the Political Consultative Conference and the organization of its Secretariat have been formally announced to be terminated. It is reported that this decision was made because all agreements and decisions made since the establishment of the Political Consultative Conference have been rejected by the Communist Party, and the government has been able to implement the Constitution and convene the National Assembly in accordance with the implementation. The Communist Party has torn up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, refused peace talks, and the government, in desperation, has implemented general mobilization throughout the country. All parties that can participate in the government have already participated. After the promulgation of this General Mobilization Order, the government's attitude has been clarified, and the Political Consultative Conference has lost its effect. Therefore, it has been decided to terminate it.</p>
<h3>Food Prices and Financial Measures are Carefully Discussed by the National Economic Commission; Economic Reform Plans will be Comprehensively Reviewed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] In order to ensure that economic policies can be coordinated with the General Mobilization Bill, the National Economic Commission held a meeting on the morning of the 9th.

The financial system section has been revised and passed, and in principle, there will still be one bank per county, and the provincial banks will still exist. The industrial section has also been revised based on the first phase of the economic construction plan and the industrial construction outline. The entire plan has not been reviewed and completed today. The meeting decided to recommend Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Xiao Jie, Yu Hongjun, Chen Fang, Zhang Jiaxuan, and Weng Wenhao to conduct a comprehensive review. The meeting on the 9th was chaired by Xu Kan.

It is said that if civil and military personnel are treated equally, the total amount of salary increase for the military personnel is estimated to reach 8 trillion.</p>
<h3>General Mobilization Measures Under Study, Censorship System Not Heard to be Reinstated, Director Tung Hsien-kuang's Signed Response to Reporter's Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference at its office at 4:30 PM on the 9th. Director Tung Hsien-kuang answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Does "General Mobilization" mean that the government will utilize private individuals' foreign assets?</p>
<p>Question: Will central ministries or provincial governments undergo any changes due to general mobilization?</p>
<p>Answer: The implementation measures for general mobilization are still under study by the government. Before they are finalized, I cannot disclose the details.</p>
<p>Question: Where is General Chen Yi currently, and what position does he hold?</p>
<p>Answer: General Chen Yi is currently residing in Shanghai and does not hold any government position.</p>
<p>Question: After the implementation of the General Mobilization Order, will the government reinstate postal and telegraph censorship?</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that China will implement military and general censorship systems. Can Director Tung provide a detailed explanation to clarify the truth? Is there any plan to implement a censorship system? According to the Xinmin Daily, all military news will be centrally released by the Central News Agency from now on. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: I am not aware of any government plan to implement general or military censorship. The report in the Xinmin Daily is not accurate.</p>
<p>Question: What is the current military situation?</p>
<p>Answer: In the past week, the National Army recovered the communist bandit supply bases of Nanma, Donglidian, and Linqu in eastern Shandong. It will now be much more difficult for the communist bandits in southern Shandong to obtain supplies from Hebei or Yantai, and they must take longer and more inconvenient routes. In the Northeast, the communist bandits who were defeated at Sipingjie retreated eastward to Xi'an and Xifeng and westward to Liaoyuan. The communist bandits are regrouping to prepare for a new offensive. The National Army moving southward in central Hebei joined forces with the defending troops at Jingtangpu on the 5th. Jingtangpu is located 15 kilometers northeast of Baoding. The 45,000 communist bandits under Chen Geng in northern Henan occupied Bo'ai and Qinyang and fled towards the north bank of the Yellow River, attempting to echo Liu Bocheng's offensive in western Shandong.</p>
<p>Question: Can general mobilization quell the internal rebellion as expected?</p>
<p>Answer: The vigorous implementation of national general mobilization indicates the government's determination to eliminate all obstacles to unification and national reconstruction. I firmly believe that this measure by the government and the awakening of the people will enable the task of quelling the communist bandit rebellion to be accomplished at an early date.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the Dalian issue, has the Soviet side responded, or are there any other new developments?</p>
<p>Answer: There are no new developments regarding the Dalian issue.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 9th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, after discussing current affairs on the 9th, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting the vigorous implementation of revolutionary diplomacy and the recovery of Lushun and Dalian to eliminate the source of unrest.</p>
<p>Sale of State-Owned Enterprises - Recent Developments</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, Director Tung Hsien-kuang gave a report at the press conference on the 9th. It is reported that the measures for allocating state-owned production enterprises to private operation, which are related to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, are: (1) The China Textile Machinery Corporation will sell 70% of its total assets. (2) The China Tobacco Company will be sold in its entirety. (3) The China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company will sell all of its original 40% of government-owned shares. (4) The China Silk Company will first issue stocks for 50% of its shares and sell them publicly. The recent developments are as follows: (1) China Textile Corporation: The company's assets are vast and its equipment is complex. To handle the matter carefully, experts and relevant personnel have been hired to form a valuation committee. Former Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun and Vice Minister Liu Siying have successively served as chairmen to date. The committee has held five meetings, and the valuation work is actively underway. (2) China Tobacco Company: The preliminary estimated value of the company's factories and three warehouses at the end of March this year was 61.4333 billion yuan. The first and second factories have been approved for priority purchase, totaling 6.9611 billion yuan. There are 65 cigarette machines, with a potential monthly output of 10,000 large cartons and an actual output of 6,000 large cartons. The profit for the 35th year of the Republic was 4.25 billion yuan. (3) China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company: The company's total registered capital is 6 billion yuan, with 40% being government-owned shares, which are offset by enemy and puppet properties taken over. The properties taken over are the Toyota Automobile Factory, the Fifth Factory of the Japan Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Far East Steel Wire Cloth Factory, and two properties on Yuyuan Road and Emei Road in Shanghai. The market value was estimated at 4.575 billion yuan in mid-November of the 34th year of the Republic, which already exceeds the 40% of government shares. Recently, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee re-evaluated it at 44.2447 billion yuan. This amount will be sold to the people without the company having to transfer the accounts. This method has been directly reported by the committee to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) China Silk Company: The company has three silk mills and one spun silk mill that can be used to issue stocks, with a total asset value of 6.33 billion yuan. All are valuations at the time of takeover. However, how to value and price them has been referred to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In addition, there are several units of silkworm farm research institutes left for experimental use and with no hope of profit, which have been approved for priority purchase, but the method of issuing stocks has not been adopted due to the different nature of the operations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the press conference will be adjourned for one month during the summer, which has been agreed upon by the reporters attending the meeting on the 9th.</p>

<h3>Distribution of Japanese Reparations to Begin Soon, MacArthur's Headquarters Announces, China, Philippines, Netherlands Indies, etc. Asked to Apply</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the first batch of Japanese reparations will soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya. These countries should submit their applications immediately. The reparations include machine tools, metallurgical machinery from former Japanese arsenals, and artificial rubber plant equipment. These factories are not needed by Japan's peacetime industry. The Far Eastern Commission stipulates that the first batch of reparations is 30% (China 15%, Philippines 5%, Netherlands Indies 5%, Burma and Malaya combined 5%). Representatives from all countries accepting reparations are present here. MacArthur has not specified a distribution date but expects it to proceed quickly.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Despite MacArthur's announcement today that the first batch of Japanese reparations will soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya, many obstacles remain ahead. The Far Eastern Commission has listed surplus materials that can be used for reparations, including arsenals, aircraft factories, machine tools, shipbuilding facilities, steel mills, and power plants. Although MacArthur has proposed machine tools and some machinery this time, he has not specified whether these reparations constitute the full 30% of the first batch, nor has he specified when they can be dismantled and shipped. Officials at MacArthur's headquarters and representatives from China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya have not commented on these issues. However, machine tools are the only remaining industrial surplus in Japan that has been allocated for reparations based on a provisional plan. China and the Philippines are particularly keen to obtain power plant machinery.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] According to well-informed sources, the initial reparations include only two parts of the eleven or twelve categories of materials in the 30% temporary reparations plan. According to this source, the first step can only include a portion of the 30% because the full list of 100% has not yet been completed. The delegations of various countries in Japan have not yet received the list of factories included in today's announcement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Allied Reparations Technical Advisory Committee held its fourth meeting today to continue discussing the monetary value of reparations. Many Allied countries opposed the U.S. valuation method, believing that the U.S. valuation was "too high." It is also understood that preparations are underway to distribute more than 300,000 pieces of mechanical equipment. It is expected that a draft of the list can be completed within three months. After the list is prepared, the countries requesting reparations may submit their requests immediately, but the transportation of the reparations may be delayed until May or June.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will hold a second lottery to distribute the remaining 92 Japanese destroyers and escort destroyers. Naval representatives from the four countries will visit Maizuru tonight to inspect the "sample warships" selected from the 60 warships.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Provincial Government Receives Japanese Assets, Part to Be Used as Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 8th] The Taiwanese Provincial Japanese Property Handling Committee, after working for one year and four months, has recently listed in its final report the total amount of Japanese assets received in Taiwan, which was recovered from half a century of occupation in the previous year, as 15,665,535,108.37 Japanese yen. (Regarding this statistic, our correspondent in Taiwan reported a few weeks ago, which was published in this newspaper on the 27th of last month).</p>
<p>The Japanese assets left in Taiwan can be used to offset a portion of Japan's reparations to China when the peace conference with Japan is convened in the future. However, it is believed that the portion that can be offset will not be very large. According to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, only a portion of the Japanese assets received by China in Taiwan can be used as reparations, and not all of the assets can be used as reparations. For example, land seized by the Japanese from Taiwanese compatriots, military supplies left behind by the Japanese army, buildings of the Governor-General of Taiwan, and some concealed Japanese assets discovered by our side are all in the "non-reparations" category. Therefore, it is necessary to recalculate how much of the above total amount can be used as reparations and how much cannot be used as reparations.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Discusses Trade with Japan: National Goods Urgently Need to Open a Market in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Liu Qiguang, chairman of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled to go to Beijing today (the 10th). He told reporters yesterday that he will discuss the control of coal and trade with Japan with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Regarding the control of coal, the current method cannot encourage coal merchants to develop new mines. Taiwanese merchants hope that for the increased production quantity beyond the current output, half will be allowed for merchants to freely transport and sell, and the profits obtained will subsidize the losses suffered due to control. Under the new method, it is estimated that one million tons can be increased in production within a year, which will greatly benefit the coal shortage in North China and South China. Regarding trade with Japan, because the existing industries in Taiwan were all established by Japan, the parts of the machines cannot be used unless they are manufactured by Japan. Therefore, many factories are currently shut down. After the resumption of trade with Japan, it is hoped that Taiwan's sugar, salt, and fruits can be exchanged for a large number of Japanese-style machine parts. In the past, Taiwan was a market monopolized by Japanese goods. If national goods cannot open up a market in Taiwan in the future, then after a year, Taiwan will undoubtedly become the world of Japanese goods again. I have met with 27 national goods manufacturers in Shanghai and made three suggestions at that time: (1) I hope that business people in this city will organize a delegation to Taiwan for inspection; (2) I hope that a large-scale national goods exhibition will be held in Taiwan on October 25th of this year to commemorate the second anniversary of Taiwan's recovery; (3) Establish a Taiwan branch of the National Goods Joint Venture Company in Taiwan. All three points were accepted, which is very gratifying. At the same time, with the low cost of electricity and labor in Taiwan, developed transportation, and economic stability, it is an ideal location for industrial development. Therefore, I also hope that small factories in Shanghai will move to Taiwan to operate within a possible range. Japanese industrial materials for reparations can be allocated in large quantities to set up factories in Taiwan, and large amounts of idle funds in Shanghai can be used to buy Japanese factories that are stalled in Taiwan. If this can be done, it will definitely improve the industrialization of Taiwan and greatly help the national economy. Since the reform of Taiwan's system, politics and economy have become stable. In the future, we should gradually strive for prosperity.</p>
<h3>Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Negotiations, Both Sides Closer, Only a Few Minor Points Remain to Be Negotiated</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 8th] The Dutch government will hand over 500,000 Malaysian dollars to Chinese shipowners tomorrow morning as compensation for six ships and cargo detained by the Dutch at sea in Indonesia last year. This will be the first stage in ending the year-long Sino-Dutch dispute. The compensation will be handed over to the shipowners by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At the same time, the Dutch government will soon compensate other ships on the same basis. According to the meeting of Chinese shipowners last month, it was decided to accept the above compensation on the condition that the Dutch government also compensate other ships.</p>
<h3>Shandong Plans to Build a Farm Tool Factory, UNRRA Promises to Allocate Machinery</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Qingdao, 9th] Ding Yihai, director of the Shandong Construction Department, stated that UNRRA has agreed to allocate more than 130 tons of machinery for the construction of a farm tool manufacturing factory in Shandong Province. The machinery will be shipped to Jinan by the end of this year. The factory will be jointly operated by the government and private sector and will be merged with the Shandong Machinery Factory. After returning to Jinan in the coming days, preparations will be made. Ding came to Qingdao to contact the Qingdao Branch of UNRRA regarding the urgent repair of the Jinan-Wen River highway. The branch has agreed to provide 8,000 bags of flour. It is reported that the Jinan-Da Wen section is being urgently repaired by 20,000 laborers. The total length is 120 kilometers, and the project can be completed in one and a half months. The external transportation of Jinan can be eased. The current daily need for grain in Jinan is 350 tons, and the need for coal is 1,000 tons. The difficulties can be resolved.</p>

<h3>Maritime Administration Conference Successfully Concludes, Minister of Communications Awards Medals to Yang Guanbei and Others, Chairman Receives Representatives at His Residence</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanking, 9th] The Maritime Administration Conference held its closing ceremony at 12:00 noon on the 9th.

<h3>Important Proposals Passed</h3>
<p>The Maritime Administration Conference held a general meeting before the closing ceremony and passed all the proposals within three hours.

<h3>Business Delegation to Japan at the End of the Month, Completely False to Say They Will Go to the United States Instead</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] According to a member of the business delegation to Japan, the rumor that the delegation will go to the United States instead is completely false. The Allied Headquarters originally hoped that the Chinese business community could produce a delegation to go there. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a document to explain this, and the number of people in the delegation is also being discussed. It is expected that it will be possible to make the trip by the end of this month. When private trade in Japan opens next month, 64 Chinese businesses will be able to participate. This number is equal to the number of British Empire businesses, second only to the United States. Our difficulties are nothing more than two: one is that transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and our U.S. dollar position is lacking; the other is that we lack exports, and some major exports are in competition with Japan. The purpose of the delegation's trip to Japan is to investigate the materials that each side can supply. As for the list of 64 businesses, the competent authority will review it based on the nature of their business, and this will take time. Regarding trade policies with Japan, Nanjing has repeatedly held meetings to discuss them. Taiwan occupies an important position in Sino-Japanese trade because the sugar, salt, and fruits produced there are urgently needed by Japan, and Taiwan's camphor can be sold to the United States. Taiwan has a good industrial base and a stable currency system. We should give American business people the opportunity to inspect Taiwan, and in the future, American capital may participate in Taiwan's economic construction.</p>
<h3>Chinese Communists Refuse to Stop Military Action, Yellow River Levee Restoration More Difficult, Talks Between Mixed Committee Yield No Results, Ministry of Water Resources to Issue Announcement Explaining the Process in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanking, 9th] The Mixed Committee organized by the Government, the Chinese Communists, and UNRRA for the Yellow River levee restoration work held a meeting in Dongming on the 7th. The representatives of the Chinese Communists, Wang Huayun and Yang Gongsu, arrived at 10:00 AM. At the meeting, the representatives of the Government and UNRRA pointed out that the Chinese Communists' crossing of the river and harassment from the Jiekou area on June 30th hindered the Yellow River levee restoration project, and that the military issue should be resolved first. The representatives of the Chinese Communists did not agree and insisted on discussing the current state of affairs. The representatives debated fiercely for two hours without any results. The representatives of the Chinese Communists then stated that the mission of the Mixed Committee was different from that of the former Joint Committee, which only discussed the levee restoration issue. They had not received this order when they came, so they needed to return to Shandong to ask for instructions before they could continue the discussion. The talks were suspended at about 6:00 PM, and the representatives of the Chinese Communists stated that they must return to the north bank of the river on the 8th and would reply at 2:00 PM whether to continue the meeting. Subsequently, representatives of the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of National Defense, and UNRRA, Lu Zhenxing, Ye Nan, and Ding Zhizhong, returned to Bian on the 8th. In addition, the representative of the Ministry of Water Resources specially stated at the meeting that the Ministry of Water Resources expected that all dangerous projects on the Yellow River could be completed before July 10th. Now the Chinese Communists have suddenly crossed the river to disrupt the project, and all previous efforts have been wasted. If the south bank collapses, the responsibility should be borne by the Communist side.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It has been learned that Minister of Water Resources Xue Jianbi will issue a public announcement in the coming days to clarify the responsibility for the Yellow River levee restoration, explain the process of consultation and obstruction by the Chinese Communists since the Yellow River damming, and describe the repeated attacks by the Communist army and even crossing the river after the completion of the damming, as well as the convening of the Mixed Committee for consultation. The announcement will be made public.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Advance the China Reconstruction Finance Corporation?</h3>
<p>The economic reform plan has been reviewed, and there are reports that it will be submitted to the National Economic Council for discussion today. According to the plan, many of the more meaningful suggestions for the current situation have been adopted, such as the establishment of the China Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It is reported that the National Economic Council has already made concrete decisions regarding this measure during its review, and we would like to offer our views to promote its early realization.</p>
<p>The so-called China Reconstruction Finance Corporation is essentially a counterpart to the Kōgyō Ginkō, or an industrial investment bank. Its most important task is to provide industrial capital to facilitate its development and financing. Therefore, the required capital amount is quite large, and cannot be compared to other general financial institutions. The reason for this is very simple: industrial capital must have two essential elements: low interest and long duration. Without either, it is not sufficient to fulfill its mission. Although current financial institutions seem to have a surplus, the industrial sector still feels that financing is difficult and capital is short. Despite the fact that the Joint Treasury of Four Banks accepts all kinds of industrial loans, with amounts ranging from tens to hundreds of billions, the financial difficulties of the industrial sector have not been alleviated. This is because the aforementioned two essential elements have not been fully met.</p>
<p>Why can't these two essential elements be fully met? There are naturally many reasons. There are too many banks and institutions, and the dispersion of forces makes it impossible to supply sufficient head offices, this is one reason; in name and form, each institution is divided and in charge of its own affairs, but in fact, most of them are still commercial in nature, this is another reason; the general interest rate is too high, and the interest rate on industrial loans is naturally raised accordingly. It is not easy to suppress. Doesn't the economic reform plan clearly acknowledge that there are unreasonable behaviors such as withholding interest and collecting handling fees? This is the third reason; the government's monetary policy is too unstable, sometimes quite loose, sometimes suddenly tightened, and the difference in the level of interest rates often exceeds more than one, making it difficult for the general financial and industrial sectors to let go and engage in their work, this is the fourth reason; because the value of the currency is too unstable, reducing people's interest in savings, especially long-term savings deposits, which are extremely rare, making it impossible for the financial sector to obtain funds that can be loaned out for a long time, but specialization has not been thoroughly achieved. In addition, the new banking law has stipulated for industrial banks: loans for agricultural, industrial, mining and other production, public utilities or transportation enterprises are their main business, and it is limited that more than 65% of the total amount of deposits they receive should be applied to industry. However, how to gradually adjust in order to comply with this provision also requires a considerable amount of time, this is the sixth. In short: whether various financial institutions are happy to accept this low-interest and long-term industrial loan is one question; and whether they actually have such sufficient ability is another question. Therefore, the establishment of this China Reconstruction Finance Corporation seems to be very necessary for the current national industry.</p>
<p>The question is how to raise the huge capital of this company? Raising commercial shares is, of course, a necessary part of the topic. There is so much idle capital in the market now; in theory, we can take this opportunity to absorb it in order to incorporate it into the right battlefield and assist production. However, the target of idle capital is probably not where the drunkard's intention lies. Judging from the results of the solicitation of US dollar bonds, it is obviously close to ideal to rely solely on commercial shares for funding.</p>
<p>Secondly, let the national banks share a part, which seems to be possible. In the past, industrial loans were often jointly borne by various banks. Now the situation is the same, and the goals are the same, but instead of turning small amounts into large amounts, it is handled by another fixed group in charge, and I believe that there will be no lack of collective efforts and optimistic success. However, the joint forces of the four banks are still unable to cope with the current needs of the industrial sector. Will their strength be expanded if they change their approach in the future? This is of course also a question.</p>
<p>The next is to absorb foreign investment, which is a very ideal requirement, and its possibility seems to be very high as long as the method is appropriate. Because this is a purely financial institution and a sound institution that promotes production, it does not contain any political implications. If the task of this institution, as intended by the original proposer, is to be expanded to include agency machines, raw materials, guarantee savings, remittances, etc., we believe that there is reason to arouse the interest of foreign investors.</p>
<p>The next is that the government allocates a part of the funds. Regarding this point, we would like to lend a hand to the government. The first is the handling of Japanese compensation factories. According to the government's unofficial statement, a price sale method will be adopted in the future. It seems that this sum of money can be fully or partially allocated to be used as the funds of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Because the money exchanged from the factory is still used to help the industry; it can be called justified. Moreover, according to the name, the Japanese compensation materials were originally to compensate the losses of both public and private parties. If it is inconvenient to directly compensate the losses of each individual due to various reasons, then directly using it to enrich the funds of China Reconstruction Finance is indirectly to supplement the vitality of the general national industry, which is much more meaningful than transferring it to other areas.</p>
<p>The second is to transfer the security deposit funds paid by various banks and institutions. This reserve has always been deposited in the Central Bank with interest. The new banking law has been changed to be deposited in the bank designated by the central authority in charge. If designated by the central authority in charge, the deposit to China Reconstruction Finance Corporation is legally compliant; and it seems very appropriate in terms of sentiment and reason to deposit it in the company with low interest, and the company still lends it to industry with low interest. As mentioned above, the difficulty of industrial capital lies in the longer period in addition to the low interest? This point, the security deposit in the original paying banks, although the deposits of its depositors are constantly changing, and as a result of innovation, the total amount payable; under normal conditions, there will never be a sharp change. Therefore, changing the payment to the Reconstruction Corporation is most suitable as a long-term industrial loan. Of course, from the perspective of the Central Bank's operation, this may be a loss. However, the Central Bank has wider sources of income and does not necessarily need this sum of money to operate. It has the responsibility to regulate and assist various banks; it should be able to support the full or partial movement of this security fund.</p>
<p>The government has confidence in the company's assistance, and we don't need to add our two cents. However, financial difficulties are a well-known fact. However, these two methods do not require the government to issue more banknotes, nor do they require the creation of another source of income. With a wave of the hand, the company can lay the foundation and quickly start its business. If we combine the other fund-raising solutions above and promote them at the same time, the company's required amount of gold, although large, will not be at a loss, and the financial difficulties currently faced by the national industry can be greatly helped.</p>
<p>For industrialized countries, this type of industrial finance is an indispensable organization; their names are not exactly the same, and their businesses may not be completely consistent, but the point of providing low-interest and long-term industrial loans is generally the same. Undoubtedly, the guidance and assistance of this type of financial institution is a major aid to their rapid development in industry. My country is currently facing numerous difficulties, and the oppression of high interest rates is a fatal injury to the industrial sector, so we hope that this plan can be established quickly, and we especially hope that all relevant parties will apply various possible methods to promote it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Franco's Test</h3>
<p>Franco's Spain recently held a plebiscite, which in practice is somewhat equivalent to the popular vote in our theory of the five-power constitution. According to the Associated Press's message from Madrid, over 80% of the national population approved the head of state construction law submitted by the government for a vote, and absolutely trusted Franco as the head of state, and authorized Franco to appoint the royal family to succeed him. According to Reuters, there was no disturbance in the country that day. This is truly a major test for Franco. We seem to be no longer able to say that Franco's regime does not have the support of the people: over 80% of the national population supports him, which cannot help but make us have some feelings.</p>
<p>Franco's Spain seems to have been deprived of its civil rights in international politics. It is not a member of the United Nations, nor does it participate in various international conferences. All of this is due to the conspiracy and destruction of the International Communist Party. Since the Soviet Union opposed Franco's Spain's participation in international politics, and most countries after the war yearned for the beautiful dream of "one world" and did not want to break with the Soviet Union, under this situation, Franco's Spain could only seek its own development in "glorious isolation." However, what is worth noting is that although the US government has not publicly given Franco support, the US business and financial sectors have often provided assistance to Franco's Spain. Moreover, what is even more worth noting is that although the Communist Parties in various places continue to launch anti-Franco movements, the Soviet official sometimes sends autumn waves to Franco. Franco's Spain is worthy of our attention; in addition, if South America's Argentina and other countries that inherit Spanish culture are united, it is by no means shallow that it is related to the lasting peace of the world. We cannot follow suit and ignore Spain!</p>

The Soviet ambassadors stationed in the above three countries only expressed their opinions to the governments of the three countries, saying that the Marshall Plan would undermine the sovereignty of the participating countries, but it seems that they did not intend to use diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Romanian Capital 9th] The Romanian cabinet decided this morning to refuse to participate in the European Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press Bulgarian Capital 9th] The Bulgarian Council of Ministers decided today not to participate in the European Conference to be held in Paris on the 12th of this month.</p>

<h3>Bevin Discusses European Cooperation; Praises Marshall's Economic Aid to Europe Plan; Particularly Pleased with the Transfer of Power in India</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 8th] Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech at a luncheon at the Fulham Club today, expressing optimism about the situation in Europe and advising Europeans to abandon all obstacles to cooperation. He stressed that Europe needs unity and harmony, and that historical and ethnic prejudices that hinder cooperation must be abandoned. Bevin added: The issue of peace with Japan is causing a lot of headache.</p>
<p>When mentioning the situation in India, he believed that the transfer of power to the Indians was a great victory for British and Indian politicians. The fate of these 400 million people can be discussed and handled in a rational and agreed-upon manner, without resorting to guns, which is very gratifying. There is no serious unrest within the British Empire, as Britain is trying to meet the gradually increasing needs of its people. When mentioning the situation in Europe, Bevin believes that there is now a pleasant symbol that European problems can be dealt with on an economic foundation, which may be the greatest contribution to promoting European unity. Europe needs unity and harmony. The wounds it suffered during the war were enormous, but he is still optimistic about Europe's future. He hopes that the European people will abandon the historical or ethnic prejudices that hinder cooperation. He feels that in today's environment, impatience is another seed of struggle, so it must not be allowed to occupy human thought, and honest policies must be pursued to achieve the goal. When he met with the French and Soviet foreign ministers in Paris, he said that the continued existence of the post-war consequences in Europe should be stopped. He should do his best and cooperate with those who are willing to cooperate, and keep the door open to those who have not yet expressed cooperation. He believes that since those who are not very cooperative cannot be satisfied with words at present, they should be proven with facts. Just when European unity seemed impossible, Secretary of State Marshall suddenly called on Europe to unite and help itself without discussion, and allowed the United States to use its resources to assist the recovery of Europe, so that Europe would not suffer another catastrophe. As far as Europe is concerned, it cannot ask the United States any more questions or ask for explanations. Europe should take advantage of Marshall's generous offer and automatically engage in cooperation to show that the saying that Europe is divided is just nonsense.</p>

<h3>Security Council Discusses Balkan Situation; Soviet Representative Proposes Counter-Proposal; Full-Scale Offensive Against Truman Doctrine</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, August 8th Dispatch] When the United Nations Security Council resumed its contentious debate on the Balkan issue, Soviet Representative Gromyko launched a new full-scale offensive against the Truman Doctrine. In a lengthy and fierce speech lasting eighty minutes, Gromyko opposed most of the investigation reports and recommendations of the Balkan Investigation Committee, widening the gap between the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, he submitted a Soviet counter-proposal to the Council. Although these counter-proposals are in fact destined to fail, they are intended to show the Soviet Union's repeated efforts to obstruct the Truman Doctrine's policy of preventing Communist expansion. Gromyko urged the Council to demand the complete withdrawal of foreign military personnel stationed in Greece and to establish a committee to ensure that any economic assistance provided by foreign countries is only used "for the benefit of the Greek people."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Roswell, New Mexico, August 8th Dispatch] According to intelligence officials at the US Army bombing base here, the US Army has now obtained a "flying saucer," which landed on a pasture here last week.

Wright, the inventor of the airplane, believes that this matter is only a kind of propaganda to support the State Department's current movement, "to make us get involved in another war, so that people will frighten each other, thinking that foreign countries are taking action against us."</p>

<h3>Case of Japanese National Concealing Goods: Informant Files Another Complaint, District Procuratorate Reopens Investigation, Defendants Released on Bail After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A Japanese national named Liao Cixiong established the Zhonghe Hospital at 239 Lao Bazi Road during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. After Japan's surrender, fearing that the property and its contents would be seized by our side, he falsely claimed to be Danish and fraudulently registered the hospital with the Danish Consulate, applying for a land lease. After completing the formalities, he sold the hospital to Lü Jinfu, the owner of Kang Yi Foreign Firm. The agreed-upon price at the time was 10 million yuan.

Yesterday, Prosecutor Cao Hong, who is handling the case, summoned defendant Liao Cixiong, Zhang Boquan, secretary of Kang Yi Foreign Firm, and related party Lu Yiyun for interrogation, and each was released on bail after interrogation.</p>
<h3>Daughter of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Found After Disappearance; Marriage-Related Stress Led to Running Away From Home; Acting Abnormally, Wandering at Hangzhou Station; Xie Liheng's Family Overjoyed Upon Receiving News</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xie Zheng, the 28-year-old fourth daughter of Xie Liheng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner residing at 20 Mei Fu Lane, Pike Road, disappeared from home three days ago due to a nervous breakdown. Just as the family was extremely anxious and searching everywhere, she was discovered at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Hangzhou Station yesterday morning. However, the railway authorities were unaware of her identity. Initially, they noticed her wandering inside the station for a long time without leaving, and due to her</p>
<p>peculiar attire</p>
<p>and mysterious behavior, the railway police became suspicious. Upon approaching her for questioning, she remained silent, only shaking her head. They then took her to the local police precinct. The woman remained silent as before, only gesturing to indicate that she was a mute. Subsequently, they gave her paper and pen for communication. The woman quickly wrote on the paper, revealing her name to be Xie Zheng, originally from Changzhou, residing at 20 Mei Fu Lane, Pike Road, Shanghai. She was then temporarily detained. Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the woman became terrified and, in desperation, suddenly</p>
<p>shouted for help</p>
<p>This made the police even more suspicious. After further interrogation, they telegraphed the Shanghai Police Department to notify the woman's family. The Xie family, who had been in a state of chaos due to their daughter's disappearance for three days, was both shocked and overjoyed upon receiving this news. Last night, the reporter visited the Xie residence and inquired about the details from her second brother, Xie Linshen. According to him: Xie graduated from Yunzhong Girls' High School in Shanghai in the early years of the War of Resistance, and then</p>
<p>went to Chongqing</p>
<p>to continue her studies at Sichuan Provincial Fourth High School, graduating and starting work at the Changshou Resources Committee in 1943. According to rumors, Xie was suffering from</p>
<p>marriage related stress</p>
<p>Initially depressed, her behavior gradually became abnormal. In the spring of last year, Xie returned east by boat, at which time</p>
<p>the whole family was delighted</p>
<p>Hoping that this would alleviate her mental distress. Unexpectedly, Xie remained unchanged, often showing signs of restlessness. The family then intended to arrange a marriage for her, hoping that this would lead to a cure.

<h3>Wage Dispute in the Civilian Shipping Industry: Labor and Management Both Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Workers in the civilian shipping industry have been on strike for six days due to a wage dispute. Previously, the highest monthly salary for workers in the industry was 248,000 yuan, and the lowest was 77,500 yuan, in addition to alcohol money. Subsequently, the workers demanded a doubling of wages. The Bureau of Social Affairs, in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Utilities, stipulated that from May, the highest salary would be 744,000 yuan and the lowest would be 232,500 yuan. The management stated that it could not afford this, only agreeing to an increase of 1.1 times, so the workers began to strike. Through mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, a compromise solution was proposed to increase wages by 1.5 times. The labor side indicated that it could agree to this, but the management still stated that it could not afford it. Yesterday, both sides sent representatives to the bureau to petition.

<h3>Li Lili in Hollywood; Sun Yu Expected to Return This Winter</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The famous Chinese movie star Li Lili has recently been in Hollywood, observing American film production techniques. In the photo, standing next to Li is her friend, Hollywood star George Raft, who is currently producing a film called "Intrigue" at his own expense. The photo shows Li and George in front of the film's set.</p>
<p>Li was a key actress for the old Lianhua Film Company. In 1944, she went from Chongqing to the United States, which was the year before the victory of the War of Resistance and at a time when the Pacific War was tense. At that time, the United States had several films planned to be gifted to China, but there was an urgent need for Mandarin dubbing and suitable talent was lacking. Later, they learned that Li Lili was a famous Chinese actress visiting the United States, and she was invited to take on the dubbing work. After the victory, Li completed her mission and went to Hollywood. At that time, Sun Yu, the famous director of the old Lianhua Company, along with Si Tongmin and Zheng Yongzhi, also came to the United States to study. They jointly researched screenwriting methods until now.</p>
<p>Li recently sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, stating that she will return to China with Sun Yu in November of this year, because her husband, Luo Jingyu, is currently the director of the China Film Studio in Nanjing, and she may take the opportunity to showcase her talents.</p>
<h3>Master Scholar of a Generation, Hu Pu'an, Passed Away Yesterday; Funeral Today Followed by Public Memorial Service; Funeral Committee Telegrams National Government for Posthumous Commendation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Revolutionary elder, master scholar, former Director of the Shanghai Gazetteer Office, and current Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Documentation Committee, Hu Pu'an (pictured), had been suffering from hemiplegia for years and recently contracted liver cancer, which proved incurable. His condition suddenly worsened the night before last, and doctors were helpless. He passed away at 3:50 AM yesterday, at the age of 70. His remains were moved to the China Funeral Home on Huashan Road yesterday morning. The cremation is scheduled for 2:00 PM this afternoon. His friends have established the Hu Pu'an Funeral Committee to handle the funeral arrangements. Yesterday's meeting decided: (1) to send a telegram to President Chiang Kai-shek to report the news and request that veteran members of the Party and State in Nanjing be listed as initiators to hold a memorial service on a fixed date; (2) to send a telegram to the National Government requesting posthumous commendation and to have Hu's biography included in the National History Archives; (3) to request the Municipal Government to allocate funeral expenses; (4) to hold a public memorial service after the funeral today. Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Zhang Yi and others were chosen to preside over the memorial.</p>
<p>Mastered Politics, Economics, History, and Philology from a Young Age</p>
<p>Hu Pu'an, a native of Jing County, was born on October 8th, 34 years before the founding of the Republic of China. From a young age, he studied the Confucian classics and history, excelling especially in philology. Before the founding of the Republic, he participated in the Tongmenghui, the Nanshe, and the Guocui Xuebao in Shanghai, promoting principles and advocating revolution. Subsequently, he served at the Minli Bao, Taipingyang Bao, and Zhonghua Minbao, and lectured at various universities in Shanghai. In 1916, he served as a secretary at the Ministry of Transportation. Later, he served as a secretary in the office of the Fujian Province Inspector General, and then came to Shanghai to serve as the Chief of the Compilation and Investigation Section of the Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railway Administration. At the same time, he continued to teach, serving successively as the Chairman of the Department of Sinology at National University and Chizhi University. In 1930, he served as a specialist at the Examination Yuan and also as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, concurrently serving as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. He resigned in 1932, continued to teach at various universities, and presided over the editorial policies of the Minguo Daily. In April 1939, he suffered a stroke, becoming hemiplegic, and remained at home, focusing on writing. His works, such as "An Ancient Historical View of the Book of Changes," "Commentary on Zhuangzi," "Theories of Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism," and "New Interpretations of the Doctrine of the Mean," were innovative and formed his own unique perspective.</p>
<p>Confined Himself to Writing During the Occupation</p>
<p>During that time, the atmosphere of the enemy was menacing. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang secretly established an organization in the isolated island of Shanghai to control public opinion, called "Zhenglun She," dedicated to providing anti-Japanese and anti-puppet editorials to the newspapers. Mr. Hu was hired as the chairman. After Shanghai fell under enemy occupation, the environment became increasingly harsh. He confined himself to writing, remaining unwavering and unyielding, a spiritual fortress behind enemy lines. After the victory and restoration, the Minguo Daily resumed publication in Shanghai, and he was appointed as the president. When the Shanghai Gazetteer Office was restored, he was appointed as the director. When the Gazetteer Office became the Documentation Committee, he continued to serve as the chairman, working extremely hard. In his spare time, he continued to write and teach without tiring. His recent works, "Methods of Confucian Self-Cultivation" and "Absolute Theory of Philology," are particularly renowned works.</p>
<p>Liver Cancer Proved Incurable</p>
<p>Mr. Hu practiced what he preached in academics, was knowledgeable and insightful. Although he suffered from illness for a long time, he remained steadfast in his beliefs. His indomitable spirit was enough to overcome the invasion of the disease. It was only recently discovered that he was suffering from terminal liver cancer, and doctors were helpless. He finally passed away yesterday morning. He had three sons: the eldest, Daoyan, is a senior engineer at the Ministry of Transportation and is currently on his way back from the United States; the second, Daozhang, works in the news media; the youngest, Daotong, works at the Municipal Gazetteer Office. He had four daughters: the eldest, Weiping, is skilled in calligraphy and painting and married to a Mr. Xu, who has passed away; the second, (missing name), married to Chang; the third daughter, Qin, married to Sun; and the fourth daughter, Ling, is not yet married. His eldest grandson, Chuanjun, is only four years old.</p>
<h3>Terrible Accident on Yangshupu Road: One Killed, Twenty-Nine Injured in Vehicle Overturn</h3>

When it drove to the entrance of the No. 17 Textile Factory on Yangshupu Dongting Road, a textile worker named Wang Xuemao attempted to cross in front of the truck. Wei braked suddenly, causing the truck to overturn. Wang Xuemao was crushed and his skull fractured, killing him on the spot. At the same time, twenty-eight male and female technicians on the truck were injured and were all sent to the hospital. Wang, the director of the Yangshupu Police Precinct, rushed to the scene with police officers to investigate upon receiving the report. The driver who caused the accident also suffered head injuries.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Employment Scam: Two Defendants Summoned, Only One Appears in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Daoyao and Wang Guangming colluded in fraud. Wang Guangming claimed to be the director of the Investigation and Guard Group of the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, responsible for recruiting over one hundred investigators and guards, each of whom could earn a salary of several hundred thousand yuan per month. At that time, many people seeking employment approached Wang, each paying an introduction fee of 320,000 yuan. More than forty people were deceived, collecting a total introduction fee of over ten million yuan. Afterwards, when the victims Lu Wei, Qiu Yougen, Miao Kaiyan, etc., realized they had been scammed, they filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Cao Hong, who is handling the case, summoned the defendants for interrogation. Wang Daoyao did not appear due to illness.

<h3>Private Radio Station Busted: Used Only for Providing Business Information</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Gan Jue, head of the intelligence team of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, recently discovered Qu Jinshan, Ku Kangnian, Huang Shuxi, Zhang Zhao'ou, etc., operating a private radio station inside the Huashang Hotel room 14 on Beihai Road. After investigation and interrogation, it was confirmed. Ku Kangnian confessed: He used to work for the puppet Central News Agency. Recently, due to unemployment, Huo Xiang, a friend from Nantong, who was a reporter at the Lianghuai Salt Field Commissioner's Office, wrote to him saying that several cloth shops and pig merchants in the area needed someone to send telegrams on their behalf because the telegraph bureau was too slow, so he consulted with his friend Zhang Zhao'ou, purchased parts, assembled a transmitter, and charged a low fee to solve his livelihood problem. After investigation by the office, it was determined that Qu and others had violated the ban on setting up private radio stations, but there was no evidence of collusion with bandits and they were not military personnel, so they were granted bail and the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation last night.

<h3>American Dollar Bills Abandoned in Trash Can; Two Second-Hand Cloth Dealers Suspected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cheng Shuzi, deputy manager of the Guoguang Grand Theater, planned to study abroad in the United States at his own expense. The other day, he purchased 500 American dollar bills and placed them in an envelope in a desk drawer. He then cleaned out the drawer, piling the miscellaneous items on the desk. Coincidentally, the maid asked him to take a bath. After Cheng went inside, the maid saw that the desk was messy and threw the waste paper, etc., into the wastebasket and dumped it into the trash can in the alley. Cheng had forgotten about the dollar bills at the time. It wasn't until the following afternoon that he remembered the matter and questioned the maid, who was speechless. Cheng then reported it to the Songshan Police Department, who sent police officers to take the maid in for questioning. After learning about the situation, the police officers investigated and learned that two second-hand cloth dealers were suspected and are currently conducting investigations.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) "Rice" Rent</p>
<p>Chen Huaxun asks: Last October, I rented a side room downstairs from landlord Mr. So-and-so, stating that the rent was five dou of rice, to be paid monthly in cash at the current market price. At that time, the price of rice was 54,000 yuan per shi, so five dou of rice was actually worth 27,000 yuan. Because I urgently needed a place to live, I had no choice but to agree temporarily. Now the price of rice has soared, and I can hardly afford it, and I can't imagine what it will be like in the future. I would like to ask: (1) Is it legal to calculate the rent in rice? (2) At that time, it was agreed verbally, and there was no contract, is it valid? (3) If I can no longer afford the rent, can I refuse to pay it? (4) If I refuse to pay it, what kind of procedures should I take?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) There is no legal basis for calculating rent in rice. (2) A lease contract that is not established in writing is regarded as a lease with an indefinite term. Verbal contracts are not prohibited by law, but those that violate the prohibitions of Article 71 of the Civil Code are invalid. (3) The parties can negotiate with each other fairly according to the law. (4) If negotiations fail, you can apply to the court for an increase in rent.</p>
<p>(2) Cohabitation Dispute</p>
<p>Chen Ziwén asks: Mr. So-and-so has been cohabiting with Ms. Jia for many years, and the woman even has a handwritten note stating "I will not marry anyone other than you for the rest of my life." Recently, Mr. So-and-so got into a conflict with the woman's mother while drunk. At that time, the woman's mother took her daughter back, claiming that she was breaking up with Mr. So-and-so and that she would remarry. Afterwards, although Mr. So-and-so pleaded repeatedly, it was of no avail. I would like to ask: (1) With the above evidence, can Ms. Jia be forced to continue cohabiting with Mr. So-and-so? (2) If Ms. Jia remarries, does Mr. So-and-so have the right to interfere? (3) If the son born to Mr. So-and-so and Ms. Jia is adopted by his biological mother after several years, can it be refused?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Since there is no formal marital relationship, cohabitation cannot be forced. (2) There is no right to interfere. (3) Although it is a non-marital son, the relationship with his biological mother cannot be rejected.</p>

<h3>Statement by the Joint Chamber of Commerce: Striving for National Assembly Legislator Seats, Ten Reasons Against Legislative Yuan's Reduction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the standing directors and special committees of the National Joint Chamber of Commerce hosted a press conference at the Jin Gu Hotel. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, directors Zhu Huiqing, Ji Dianchuan, Qiao Senrong, and Shou Jingbi successively reported that the allocation standards for the number of legislators and National Assembly representatives from professional groups were unfair. The Joint Chamber of Commerce will unite with commercial organizations from various provinces, cities, and counties to fight for justification. The Joint Chamber of Commerce has organized a special committee, publicly electing Wang Xiaolai, Lu Xiaobo, Zhu Huiqing, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yizhai, Shou Jingwei, and Li Jianting as members to specifically engage in this movement, and has issued a declaration of more than 2,500 words, listing ten major reasons against the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the number of legislators and National Assembly representatives from professional groups. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Repeatedly Changing the Decisions of the Highest Conference</p>
<p>The number of legislative seats for professional groups was initially determined by the Supreme National Defense Council to be 119. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan arbitrarily reduced it to 56 through resolutions, while the number of professional seats in the National Assembly, 450, was passed according to the original number. The same object, but different resolutions; the same standard, but different amounts. Later, with the reorganization of the government and the abolition of the National Defense Council, the State Council re-determined the number to be 112. Unexpectedly, the Legislative Yuan changed it again, reducing it to 84, always using the excuse of wartime conditions and repeatedly making it a fait accompli before the adjournment, sending it to the State Council for reluctant retroactive approval. The solemn law, repeatedly resolved by the highest authority, stipulates, according to the "Outline of Legislative Procedures of the National Government," that "all draft laws are decided by the Political Council in principle, and the Legislative Yuan shall not change them." Now, the Legislative Yuan has repeatedly arbitrarily changed the decisions of the highest conference, which undoubtedly destroys the law and disrupts discipline, undermining the spirit of constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislators before the implementation of the Constitution were appointed by the National Government rather than elected by the people. Their nature was that of government officials, and the National Government was essentially their parent body. How can government officials resist government orders? Where is the discipline? Where does the national law exist? Now, the National Government, in order to accommodate the facts, readily approves the number illegally and arbitrarily determined by the Legislative Yuan, which does not meet actual needs, which is nothing less than cutting the feet to fit the shoes.</p>
<p>Disregarding the Social Department's Allocation Standards</p>
<p>The allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives and legislators from various sectors of the industry and commerce alliance should reasonably refer to past standards, review the total number of current members, as well as historical evolution, fairly determine them, and respect the opinions of the competent authorities, codify them, and form them into law for public knowledge. This time, the Legislative Yuan disregarded the allocation standards proposed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and arbitrarily allocated them out of thin air, as if giving alms, with highs and lows depending on their whims, obliterating everything, purely based on subjective likes and dislikes, taking the opportunity to maximize authority.</p>
<p>Standards and Proportional Increases Should Be Stipulated</p>
<p>The total number of National Assembly representatives exceeds 3,000, with only 13 from the business community, accounting for only 4/1000. The total number of legislators exceeds several hundred, with only 5 from the business community, accounting for only 6/1000. What is the basis for this? Even within the same industry and commerce, why are 17% of the legislative seats given to industry and commerce, while only 7% of the National Assembly seats are given? Moreover, considering the allocation of all professional sectors, is the standard based on the number of members? Or is it based on the level of knowledge? Is it based on the importance of the position? Or is it based on the quality of character? It is truly incomprehensible. We do not object to increasing the number of farmers and workers, and we also welcome an increase in the number of journalists and educators, but standards should be stipulated and proportions should be increased to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Love for the Country Has Never Been Second to Any Sector</p>
<p>Commercial organizations in our country have a history of more than 60 or 70 years. They are interconnected throughout the country and serve society, and their love for the country has never been second to any sector. In every revolution, members of the business community have participated in every campaign, donating money and supplies without reservation. During the Northern Expedition, the contribution of our business community to the National Revolution, whether it was pre-war cover, mid-war assistance, or post-war effectiveness, was obvious and still vivid in our memories. Sun Yat-sen's declaration during his northward journey strongly advocated the participation of professional groups in politics. This can be described as learning from past events for future reference.</p>
<p>Greatest Sacrifice, Heaviest Tax Burden</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, businessmen were the first to rise up, making the greatest sacrifices, and their tax burden was always heavier than that of any other group. They repeatedly braved dangers and difficulties, engaged in trade, strived for materials, and regulated supply and demand to prosper the rear and promote the overall mobilization of the national economy. Even when the war had not yet ended and the flames of war were becoming more severe, industrial and commercial enterprises were on the verge of collapse. The government painstakingly worked to salvage the situation, and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs also exhausted their wisdom and efforts to break through the difficulties and jointly plan for the country's prosperity and strength. If the political system discriminates against and oppresses them, wouldn't the government be undermining its own foundation and destroying its own strength to quell the chaos and build the nation? Those who are loyal to the country would never resort to such a poor strategy.</p>
<h3>Extortion Attempt Fails, Incites Labor Strike, Joint Logistics Headquarters Clothing Factory Requests Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, due to the need for bundling hemp ropes for this year's winter military uniforms, signed contracts with Yifeng Trading Company, Xintai Rope Company, and Xiyuanxing Rope Store to manufacture 200,000 catties of hemp ropes. The three companies then set up a factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road to supervise the work and expedite production, hoping to deliver the goods on time to meet military needs. A local gangster, Yang Baichuan (also known as Yang Haichun), actually extorted 20 million yuan with guns and axes, but failed. Harboring resentment, he incited the workers to strike because most of the workers in the factory were his followers. As a result, the factory, which had started work on the 15th of last month, suddenly announced a strike on the 20th. Workers who opposed Yang's gang demanded that work resume immediately, but Yang's gang threatened to kill them. On the 3rd of this month, the Social Bureau's mediation failed, and the factory representative, Zhang Yuping, was beaten and injured. The factory reported that Yang's incitement of the labor strike prevented the 200,000 catties of hemp ropes for military supplies from being delivered on time. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Clothing Factory sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Charity Match, China United Suffers Miserable Defeat, Navy Wins 5-2</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Hong Kong] A scene of a quake relief football match added a festive atmosphere to the long-silent Jia Shan Stadium. The scorching sun on the 5th (Saturday) affected the air in the stadium.</p>
<p>The charity match was preceded by the opening game of the summer football season, between Kowloon Bus Team and Han Ying Association. The Bus Team was more energetic after Li Tiansheng suppressed the defense. As a result, they won 4-0. Neither side scored in the first half, and all the goals were scored in the second half.</p>
<p>Then the charity match was staged, Navy vs. China United, the referee was Omar. At the start of the game, China United attacked fiercely, and Shi Jin and Shi You frequently launched fierce shots, but they either hit the post or were caught. However, Deqi was in the battlefield, and China United only fought with ten people, so the situation changed.</p>
<p>The Navy launched a rapid counterattack. In the 24th minute, center forward Sijishi got the ball and went deep, and Jun Gan rushed out too early, and was shot empty, China United lost a goal first.</p>
<p>Then the Navy got another chance to rush in, and in the mixed attack, the right auxiliary hit one with his head, two to zero, China United actually got a zero egg in the first half.</p>
<p>After the break, China United adjusted the obstacles, Hong Qi replaced his brother as the right wing, Jinhe as the auxiliary, and Yingqi changed positions with Bingzhao. This time, there was a bit of vitality. After five minutes, Yingqi got a chance at ten yards and kicked the ball. The ball rubbed the post and went into the net, leveling the score to two to one.</p>
<p>In the next ten minutes, China United was at its peak, but unfortunately, it couldn't get in. After a long attack without success, the downward trend appeared. It was repeatedly scored by the Navy for three more goals, before Jinhe grabbed a goal back, making it five to two at the end of the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, China United lost miserably, but because they were tired, lacked cooperation, how could they not lose! The Navy played fast enough and had enough combat spirit. Victory was won by hard work. Both sides of this game focused on the points and arranged the positions as follows:</p>
<p>(Navy Team)</p>
<p>Bulao Greenmei Ingre Sijishi Balan Shi Shidichen Lielun Long Shi Siditu Matatu Baliyun</p>
<p>(China United Team)</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Star Island Expedition (1)</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Singapore Air Dispatch] On Sunday, June 22nd, under the scorching sun, the ever-victorious Hong Kong Star Island Football Team was finally defeated 3-1 by the Malayan Chinese United Team (referred to as Ma Hua). This was Star Island's first defeat since the expedition, and the most surprising news in the football world in months. In terms of performance, this match was not very exciting. In terms of effectiveness, Ma Hua was indeed better than Star Island. The comparison of 3 to 1 is not an exaggeration. In fact, the Ma Hua forwards, if they had cooperated a little more, could have scored two more goals. Indeed, Star Island's defeat gave us a lot of stimulation and extra excitement, but in our hearts, we still feel unsatisfied and unhappy, because the entire Star Island team's performance that day was unusually abnormal. Winning under its abnormal situation inevitably leaves a kind of contemplative meditation. Before the game, the local newspaper boasted that this was a competition for the championship and runner-up of next year's National Games football tournament. The Hu brothers (Hu Jiao and Hu Hao) each held a view, and both had the belief that their respective teams would win. Under such circumstances, what we expected was a fierce battle between equally matched forces, but the result was a one-sided, lackluster little game. Ma Hua won, but it did not win happily. Star Island played four consecutive games here, and the lineup, except for the goalkeeper, has not changed.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng, Yu Yaode, Liu Tianshen, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Xiao Gaoshan Slave</p>
<p>(Zou Wenzhi's performance in the first battle)</p>
<p>In the first two games, the performances of the center forward Zhu Yongqiang, the left winger Liu Songsheng, and the left defender Liu Tianshen were the best. Overall, Star Island is weaker in defense and stronger in attack. The attacking technique is a short triangular pass, which is better than crossing from both wings. It is a pity that several first-class players were injured in Star Island's expedition to the Philippines. Therefore, in the several games in Singapore, the ideal lineup could not be presented. Left winger Cao Qiuting and inside forward Zhang Jinhai were two strong players who could not play due to injuries. Although Liu Songsheng was competent and happy to switch from left center back to left winger, it weakened the strength of the center back line a lot. Xu Jingcheng, the once famous center back, is quite different from the past. His clear head and feet are still there, but his heavy body has affected his agility. The former Xu Jingcheng was the best at dribbling the ball back and forth, but now he can only retreat as the third defender, not only losing the heroic spirit that used to run through the entire field, but even when defending against the enemy, he often makes blind mistakes.</p>

<h3>Purchasers of Cotton Yarn Allocated by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association Should Deliver Goods Within the Time Limit - The Silk Textile Association's Fourth Committee Discusses Business Plan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association was held in the conference room of the association at 10:30 AM yesterday. Chairman Zou, Vice Chairman Wang, and committee members Liu Siying, Wu Weijing, Li Shengbo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Erren, Zhang Wenqian, Shi Fengxiang, and Yuan Zhongyuan attended. The discussion continued until after 1:00 PM before the meeting ended. The main cases discussed are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chairman Zou presented a detailed booklet on the overall cotton textile adjustment business plan of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association. The content can be mainly divided into two points: (A) Active aspects: National cotton spinning business construction plan, including raw cotton production increase targets, spinning spindle expansion numbers, and the enrichment of various textile machinery equipment. (B) Passive aspects: How to thoroughly implement the yarn and cloth adjustment policy, how to strengthen production, how to reasonably allocate finished products, including local distribution, supply to other cities, and promotion of exports. The attending committee members believed that the content of the plan was detailed and lengthy, and needed to be studied individually before providing opinions for discussion. It was decided to discuss it again at the fifth committee meeting to be held on the 11th.</p>
<p>(2) In order to avoid the cotton yarn jointly allocated from being used for hoarding and speculation, if the cotton allocated by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association is not delivered within one and a half months after the purchaser takes delivery, the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association will take it back at the original allocated price.</p>
<p>Cotton Inspection Pending Decision</p>
<p>(3) In order to determine the quality standards of cotton in various regions in the second half of the year, and the method of inspecting cotton for water seepage and impurities, it remains to be implemented. However, whether the inspection work should be carried out by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is still to be decided by the authorities for compliance.</p>
<p>(4) The six district cotton spinning guilds have submitted approximately 7,000 pieces of cotton yarn to the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association for joint distribution. The reservation orders for this batch of cotton yarn can be sent by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association to the China Cotton Textile Construction Company today. Therefore, the amount of cotton yarn for joint distribution is expected to increase from tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Chairman Zou of the association left for Beijing last night. It is heard that he will make requests to the central authorities regarding the future cotton textile adjustment policy of the association.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The association approved a total of 3,229 pieces of cotton yarn and 161,588 bolts of cotton cloth for transportation between the north and south in June. The allocation quota for transportation between the north and south this month is 5,147 pieces of cotton yarn and 239,337 bolts of cotton cloth.</p>
<h3>Yong Yarn's Capital Increase is Scheduled for Suspension - The Situation of the Chinese Stock Market Gradually Shows a Deadlock - There is Hope for Reducing the Margin for Forward Transactions</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated uncertainly yesterday. Before the capital increase, people were not without the idea of circulating Yong Yarn. There were still many蠢動in the middle. Finally, starting from the 17th, all current transactions must be suspended, and the new shares have an undetermined release date. Many stock holders inevitably took the opportunity to slip away at high prices, and retail investors were ultimately defeated. Except for Jingfu, which constantly absorbed chips at No. 204, the final result was stable, and the remaining stocks all declined in a step-wise manner, ending in a state of fatigue. Yong Yarn continued to call lower after closing. In the early morning, people's hearts were still firm, and the opening prices of the stocks were all higher. Yong Yarn opened higher to 10,700 yuan. After opening, Nos. 224, 231, 65, 76, and 89 all entered, rising from 10,650 yuan to 10,830 yuan. Nos. 61, 213, 4, 141, 235, 174, and 9 sold off, retreating to 10,750 yuan. Later, it was rumored that the representative of the broker was summoned to Beijing again, and that there was a saying that the margin for forward transactions would be reduced. Nos. 224, 89, 232, 154, 153, 102, 56, and 223 entered to 11,020 yuan. After that, although Wuhe was raised to the daily limit by No. 89, Yong Yarn was supplied and sold by Nos. 235, 152, 85, 148, 104, 91, 60, and 177, and gradually fell to 10,650 yuan. Except for Nos. 134, 223, and 14, which entered to 10,800 yuan, Nos. 91, 223, 94, 104, 125, 142, 232, and 149 sold one after another. It was heard that Yong Yarn would suspend trading, and people became timid. Yong Yarn gradually fell to a low price of 10,500 yuan. No. 31, Traffic Bank took advantage of the low price to buy in, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. Nos. 224, 218, 55, 4, 155, 223, 226, 104, and 69 all entered, and the rising wind started quickly. There was a sudden short squeeze, and soon it leaped to a high price of 11,050 yuan. Nos. 171 and 157 took the opportunity to release the dragon, and the number forced to turn back. Soon Yong Yarn implemented a capital increase, and all transactions were temporarily suspended starting from the 17th. The date when the new shares will be released was not mentioned, but it was revealed on the market. Nos. 60, 224, and 152 also fell back to 10,550 yuan. Although Nos. 177, 77, 231, and 160 came to enter to 10,800 yuan, Jingfu gradually rose due to the efforts of No. 204, and the situation was quite strong. At the close, many were forced by time to sell off again by Nos. 112, 143, and 102, and closed at 10,650 yuan. After the close, Nos. 143, 102, 218, 23, 104, and 75 all settled, and finally fell below 10,500 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Jingfu rose by half a percent, and Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Dongxing, Zhongfa, Meiya, and Xinhua all rose slightly. Yonggong slightly挫, Wuhe涨停, but the transaction was not widespread.

<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks are Both Weak</h3>
<p>The situation of government bonds was mediocre yesterday, and it turned out to be unsustainable in the middle. The morning opened at 7,100 yuan for Unified Bing, rising from 7,200 yuan. Supplied by Rooms 230 and 360, it fell to 6,700 yuan. Rooms 539 and 503 came to enter, and it was easy to turn stable. The noon closed at 7,000 yuan. The transaction was approximately more than one million, and as a result, A, B, and C each fell by 100 yuan compared with the previous closing price, Tong Ding fell by 200 yuan, and Tong Wu was still 平.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of foreign stocks was balanced yesterday, so the process was quite calm, and Yisha was just a rise and fall from 2,000 yuan. People in the gold industry and North and Guangdong gangs all supplied, and foreign firms and banks and securities gangs had纳, and as a result, only Ye Guangdong rose slightly compared to the previous close. Steel, Paper, Shipping, Telephone, and Reclamation 微挫, Yisha, Yinglian, and Yipi were all 平定.</p>
<p>Buying Gold for Foreign Exchange is Probably Difficult to Realize at Present</p>
<p>There is a proposal in the economic reform plan to buy foreign exchange with gold. This issue has been submitted by the National Economic Commission to the Central Bank for research. It is reported that the relevant departments of the Central Bank have submitted opinions separately and will be sent to the Economic Commission for a final decision. According to Shao Zhenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, in his personal capacity, it is not appropriate to buy foreign exchange with gold today, because after implementation, gold will become a scarce commodity, and merchants who generally do not have foreign exchange will compete to buy it. The涨风is enough to be alarming, and it may stimulate gold prices, and other prices may also be fluctuated. A certain economic authority also has the same view, and believes that this measure is harmful and not beneficial, and does not agree.</p>
<h3>The Margin for Forward Transactions Deposited in the National Bank is Expected to be Accommodating</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 9th] An order from the Ministry of Finance and Economics requires that 70% of the 30% margin for forward transactions be changed to deposit in the National Bank. Various securities trading brokers feel inconvenient, because according to past circumstances, 80% to 100% of the margin for forward transactions is deposited in the China and Traffic Banks, and various经纪人 also handle delivery and settlement in the China and Traffic Banks, which can be offset on the same day. According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance who spoke to reporters, it is not necessary to change the deposit of the margin into the National Bank, or it can be handled accommodatingly. However, the original order was decided by the Executive Yuan, so it is always pending the final selection of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Textile Industry - The Indian Silk Market Improves</h3>
<p>According to confirmed news, the Indian silk market has recently improved, and the market price has soared by 12 to 13 rupees per yard, with the lowest being more than 5 rupees. The batches of silk fabrics shipped to India by the Silk Weaving Association are being traded. If the transaction is settled, the profit will be double the expected profit. This is indeed good news for my country's silk processing industry.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, handled the joint distribution of cotton yarn on behalf of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association, allocating a total of 1,747 pieces of yarn, all of which were allocated to manufacturers. A total of 238 purchase orders were received.</p>
<p>Rayon Advances</p>
<p>The market price of rayon fluctuated unstably yesterday, and finally closed with an advance. Although money is tight, there is still no sign of small reductions. Gaoshan Youguang, No. 120, opened at 30.6 million yuan in the morning, and the transaction was completed immediately. People's hearts were invigorated and continued to move forward. The highest bid was 1.6 million yuan for a double offer. It fell due to many parties dumping at high prices, and 30.7 million yuan was the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, because there was still no news on the allocation of goods, holders inevitably became奇居, and it rose again. The final price was 31.2 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan out, and the closing price was 1 million yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Jing Steady</p>
<p>The factory Jing market was steady yesterday. Although rayon continued to rise, it was difficult to be optimistic about the market price due to the greater supply than demand. The high-uniformity five担头 did not close yesterday, and the asking price remained unchanged. There were slight transactions in零担, and the market price was slightly increased. The transaction price of high-grade 零担 C-grade goods was 33 million yuan, and the price of E-grade goods was 32 million yuan. Dry Jing was active, and a transaction of 21.3 million yuan was成交, and five arches lacked a transaction, but the shouting price rose by 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods挫降</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to monetary relations,浮多出笼 on silk goods, satin, and格子縐in the market, 新割 at the cost of忍痛, which led to a situation of挫降. Dacheng quilt opened small, and there was still a lack of 主at 13.1 million yuan, and later did 2.9 million yuan. The Huachang goods opened at 3 million yuan, and the smallest transaction was 2.75 million yuan. The seller shouted 2.8 million yuan later. Dacheng 縐opened at 41.45 million yuan. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it showed a tragic fall, from 1,000 yuan to 40,700 yuan at the close, which was 1,000 yuan stronger than the previous day. The last trade on the interval date was 1,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Opinions on Allocating and Selling Man-Made Silk</p>
<p>The silk weaving industry in the four districts was allocated foreign exchange by the government to purchase man-made silk from abroad to meet the needs, but the new and old meetings differed, and there were different opinions. Some proposed to allocate according to the allocation volume in December last year, and some advocated on-site investigation and re-distribution. According to the director of the industry association, it is most appropriate to re-investigate and actually allocate the actual dominant position, because the allocation volume in December last year was not uniform, and the silk goods weaving factory was also allocated man-made silk, and the one that actually needed man-made silk was allocated very little. Therefore, it is most fair to determine the allocation based on the current actual needs. There is no other appropriate delivery.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Continue to Rise - Cause and Effect, the Number of Chips is Decreasing</h3>
<p>Yarn: The price of cotton yarn continued to rise. It was heard that the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association's acquisition of private yarn accounted for 75% of the total output. People were worried, and the number of chips turned to exhaustion. The Changjiang Gang and Guangdong Gang frequently expressed intentions to purchase, coupled with the sharp increase in cloth prices, and people's hearts vibrated. The prices benefited and soared. The price slightly declined at the close, but it still rose a lot compared to yesterday. The highest price of 20-count special double horse was 12.4 million yuan, and the closing price was 12.2 million yuan, rising by 400,000 yuan. The double horse was 11.15 million yuan, up 450,000 yuan. The 24-count fine yarn was slightly higher, and the 16-count Guangming was 9.7 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. The 10-count yarn was in season and the price was the most popular. The 10-count Boy Scout was 9.5 million yuan, which was almost close to the price of 16-count yarn.</p>
<p>Cloth: Cotton cloth叠创新高价, especially 12-pound龙头细布, leading the upward trend. According to people familiar with the industry, people outside the industry are not asked about the price of 龙头细布, and they are trying to purchase it. Today's off-site transaction, the price of 龙头细布 is 476,000, which is still difficult to collect. In order to avoid stimulation, the industry association will suspend the sale and purchase in the venue from today, and strictly investigate and prohibit non-members of the industry from entering the transaction. Moreover, in the future, transactions will also be suspended in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Cotton: Yesterday, the spot cotton transaction was very旺, and the cotton yarn in the venue rose back, and the trend was very firm. It was also heard that there was another adjustment to the negotiated price of cotton yarn, so the yarn factory did its best to absorb it first, and the customer also made up for it, and the market price rose slightly compared to the previous day. The opening price of each grade to送厂 was approximately 2.1 million for Lingbao, 2.15 million to 2.22 million, 1.94 million to 1.99 million for Shashi, 1.865 million for Hanxi, and 1.63 million for Firebird. The price of the spot trade, for each Lingbao, was 1.965 million, 2 million, 2.05 million, 2.1 million, 2.15 million to 2.2 million. 1.91 million, 1.93 million, 1.97 million to 1.99 million for Shashi. 1.75 million, 1.8 million, 1.825 million, 1.865 million to 1.88 million for Hanxi. 1.72 million to 1.98 million for Sanyuzhen, 1.8 million to 1.91 million for Laohekou, and 1.72 million to 1.78 million for Shunde. 1.72 million to 1.78 million for Shandong Tuolisi, 1.6 million to 1.63 million for Firebird, and 322,000 for each set of Zhoupu籽花正牌.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work of the National Bank Discount Committee Since February - Approved Loans of More Than 36 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to make all circles understand the progress of the work of the National Bank Discount Committee in the past two months, the committee specially invited the local press to the committee's conference room at about 4 pm yesterday. The committee's Peruvian director, Lin Yue乐, reported on the overview of the committee's work in four points. The content of the conversation is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank Discount Committee was established in early April of this year. As of June 30, it has accepted 273 applications with a total amount of 84,265 million yuan, and has approved 209 loan applications with a total amount of 36.02 billion yuan. (2) President Zhang, and Vice Presidents Chen and Liu, all believe that increasing production is the most urgent task at present. They have formulated the Central Bank's measures for Shanghai commercial banks to apply for rediscounting. All are done with caution. The candidates for the Discount Committee are all leaders from the local financial and business circles. When discussing applications, they are moderately strict and gradually expand the mission of the Discount Committee. Recently, a procedure for handling industrial loan cases has been formulated as a guideline. (3) The Discount Committee strives to be simple and quick in reviewing loan applications. (4) The loan application procedures are also simplified.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Since the committee was established in early April, the loan cases and amounts approved each month have been increasing month by month. In April, there were a total of 29 loan cases with an amount of 1.01 billion yuan. In May, there were a total of 41 loan cases with an amount of 11.05 billion yuan. In June, there were a total of 139 loan cases with an amount of 23.96 billion yuan. The loans approved in June accounted for 66.3% of the total loan amount. It was also found that among the total loan amount of 36.02 billion yuan that has been approved, industrial loans accounted for 86.37%, and cotton dyeing and weaving industry accounted for the largest percentage of industrial loans, accounting for 11.85%. The wool textile industry was the second, accounting for 6.30%. The third was the underwear weaving industry, accounting for 6.08%.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Notes for Tea Remain Stable</h3>
<p>The green teas like "Chou Chen" and "Chen Mei" which are exported to French Africa, have been actively inspected by a portion of exporters in recent days. Yesterday in the market, some buyers came forward to inquire about prices. However, the sellers' thinking frequently shifted towards firmness, and their willingness to sell was not strong. As a result, negotiations at the close of the market did not reach a satisfactory conclusion, and transactions remained at a standstill. The market trend, on the other hand, became increasingly stable. Domestic tea sales remained good, and the market presented a consistent state throughout the day, with prices remaining similar to the previous day. It is reported that this year's newly fried green tea from Wuyuan is in short supply, prompting merchants to transport it from the production areas. Currently, companies such as the Great China Tea Company have already transported the tea. However, due to high acquisition costs and all related expenses, the asking price is said to be considerably higher than before.</p>
<p>New Methods for Tung Oil and Bristle Purchases and Sales - Technical Aspects Still Under Study - Exporters Still Hope Not to Purchase Directly</p>
<p>The government authorities have revised the methods for the purchase and sale of tung oil and bristles. The China Trust Bureau will purchase from merchants in the production areas and then resell to exporters, who will purchase with foreign currency. The China Trust Bureau is preparing to implement this new method. However, many technical problems remain to be studied. According to leaders in the tung oil and bristle industries, this method is indeed an improvement over the previous one. People in both industries welcome it. Because domestic producers have a guaranteed outlet, and exporters can act as sales agents, the path for smuggling can be blocked. Regarding the China Trust Bureau's direct purchase in the production areas, it is still considered to be competing with the people for profit. People in both industries also hope that merchants will be entrusted to make purchases on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Wheat Loans Can Be Implemented Immediately - Total Amount is 60 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The long-planned wheat loan has had its principles determined and is said to be implemented within days. It is reported that the wheat loan is divided into two parts. One part is an ordinary wheat loan, with the amount of the loan for each factory based on 1 billion yuan for every 1,000 bags of daily production. When applying for the loan, each factory must pay 30% of the loan funds. The estimated total loan amount is 60 billion yuan. The other part is a milling loan, entrusted by the government to the Fuxin, Maoxin, Hanfeng, Huafeng, and Yutong factories for milling. Each factory pays the loan funds in the same manner as the previous part. The total loan amount is approximately 100 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the flat-price flour allocation for this city in July will be supplied by each factory allocating 260,000 bags of flour each month after the wheat loan is issued.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Association to Send Personnel to Investigate - The Situation of Wenzhou Export Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Association previously approved a letter from the Wenzhou branch of the Bank of China, roughly stating that sailboats in the area often carry goods for export and requested to settle foreign exchange with the bank, but it was unknown whether this was allowed. The association, not knowing the details, decided to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation before determining how to handle the matter. It is reported that the association dispatched its specialist committee member Huang Yan and the vice manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, Zhen, to conduct the investigation yesterday.</p>
<p>Taiwanese Lumber Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Currently, Taiwan's Phoebe zhennan and Hinoki cypress continue to arrive at the port, with sellers quoting prices between 6,400 yuan. European pine is stable, while Chinese fir is weak.</p>
<h3>Rationed Sugar Prices Increased</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Price Evaluation Committee's Sugar Evaluation Group held its seventh meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Because the exchange rate in the Taiwan dollar zone has recently changed again, the allocation price of the Taiwan Sugar Company's 23rd phase has also been discussed and adjusted, increasing by slightly more than 30% compared to the previous phase. The new prices, after being submitted to and approved by the Chairman Kai Xian, are announced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Special grade cotton white sugar: 630,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 705,000 yuan for wholesale. (2) Grade A cotton white sugar: 580,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 650,000 yuan for wholesale. (3) Special grade granulated white sugar: 610,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 683,000 yuan for wholesale. (4) Grade B granulated white sugar: 550,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 616,000 yuan for wholesale. (5) Brown sugar: 510,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 571,000 yuan for wholesale. All sugar merchants may begin applying from today.</p>
<p>The Fifth Phase of per capita sugar distribution was resolved by the group at yesterday's meeting to continue, and sales will begin in early August. The prices are still to be discussed and determined.</p>
<h3>Small Yarn Factories in Other Cities - Requesting Allocation of Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Seventeen small yarn factories in Changshu, Wuxi, Taicang, and other three counties recently sent more than ten representatives to Shanghai to request the Cotton Regulation Committee and the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee to allocate bulk cotton. After listing the reasons, they sent a letter to the Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District to appeal on their behalf. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, the application for the allocation of foreign cotton by small yarn factories in various places was stipulated by the Textile Management Committee that those with less than 3,000 spindles would not be allocated. Several applications have been rejected. However, the spindles of small factories, if calculated individually, are insignificant. But if considered as a whole, the quantity is considerable from a production standpoint. They make a contribution to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Currently, large and medium-sized yarn factories in this city and other cities have obtained priority in cotton allocation. The production organizations of small yarn factories should be treated equally, regardless of size. Recently, cotton prices have been rising daily. The raw materials needed by the small factories, which together own 32,000 spindles, all rely on purchases from the black market. Their export costs are much higher than those of large factories, making it difficult to compete. They are on the verge of being unable to survive. In order to maintain the industry, regardless of the amount of equipment, the original regulations should be revoked. The foreign cotton stored by the head office should be quickly approved and allocated to facilitate production.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Arriving at Port at the End of April - Cotton Merchants Request Exemption from Purchase</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Merchants Association of this city stated that according to the regulations of the Central Bank, for those who had already arrived at the port before April 30 of this year but were unable to obtain a permit for foreign cotton outside the quota, the batch of cotton should be purchased by the China Trust Bureau. The batch of cotton owned by the members of the association amounts to more than 20,000 dan. In order to request the authorities to consider the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from purchase, the association convened a meeting of member representatives at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was decided to send Chairman Liu Xun-Sun, Director Chen Qing-Cheng, Sun Bing-Zhi and others as representatives to request the China Trust Bureau to exempt them from purchase.</p>

<h3>How America Attacks Communism - Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation</h3>
<p>— J. Edgar Hoover</p>
<p>Americans are currently constantly reviewing methods of preventing communism, verbally and in writing, with insightful views, making it impossible for the American Communist Party to evade the truth and moral perspective, and exposing its despicable identity nakedly. The reviews of the Communist Party by the American cultural and journalistic circles are particularly worthy of our borrowing. The "Newsweek" published on June 9, with anti-communism as the central theme, published Hoover's famous anti-communist remarks, which are especially worth reading.</p>
<p>Our best strategy for defending against communism is our</p>
<p>American-style</p>
<p>way of life. The American Communist Party, in addition to secretly spreading rumors and causing confusion, attempting to weaken the people's belief in democratic work, will never be able to achieve its hope of subverting the government. We have the strongest democracy, more freedom and a higher standard of living than anywhere else in the world, but our government! It has been a guiding light in the world's disturbances for two centuries! It is currently the target of red fascist aggression in America. It is the mainstay of preventing the world from becoming a red fascist world.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore this aggression. We must encounter and pursue it head-on, but within American methods. We must avoid using the struggle methods of the Ku Klux Klan, South American Colombia, and some fascist countries, just as we avoid using the struggle methods of the Communist Party. Absolute leaning to the right and leaning to the left are equally dangerous. There is no choice between fascism and communism, both are totalitarian, anti-democratic, and anti-God. Both use rebellion and treachery to achieve their despotic and dictatorial purposes. We do not need to adopt the espionage system commonly used by fascism and communism to fight against the Communist Party.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to protect ourselves from espionage and sabotage during this war without sacrificing general civil rights. We can also use the same defensive strategy, democratic methods, and the American way of life to protect ourselves from the infiltration of communism.</p>
<p>Our most reliable weapon is the truth; the Communist Party really cannot stand the perspective of broad daylight. Their effective work is to wear a privately concealed mask. Lies and deception are their main tools. There is really no more despicable trick than them! But they are skilled at evading the words. Lenin's remarks, the "God" of communism, are their excuse. According to Lenin: "Revolutionaries must never take legal and illegal riotous ways to fight at the same time, that is the most undesirable revolution."</p>
<p>Maintaining the American-style way of life in the</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Struggle</p>
<p>The first step is to first expose the original goals of communism and then compare it with the American way of life.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has two organizations: one is the "periphery" and its tail is completely open. They engage in shouting deceptive propaganda and put forward many "trumped-up" labels: "anti-communist", "reactionary", or even "Hitler followers" to the people who reject their doctrines. Anyone who opposes the Soviet Union is a "fascist", "imperialist", or "dictatorial capitalist". Communist swindlers or communist teams also praise democracy, but they only "say what they say is not what we mean". They use "progress" as a word to hide their conspiracies in the false words of labor, social welfare, and education.</p>
<p>Another organization——the underground organization——is a communist team with strict training, they try to suppress the false and argumentative speeches of others, and tightly hide themselves. This is the most dangerous communist figure. The preface to the Communist Party Constitution states: "The work of the Communist Party is all to fight for peace and the elimination of fascism," which is the most typical deceptive language. We remember that when communism and fascism were once allies (referring to the German-Soviet alliance), the Communist Party said</p>
<p>Threatening the White House</p>
<p>Opposing the rental of numerous support, opposing the volunteer soldier law, and the American Mutual Defense Act. When the Soviet Union left its alliance and became an enemy of Germany, the American Communist Party changed its slogan overnight, and shouted to revitalize the Soviet Union, enrich military equipment, and open up a second front.</p>
<p>The fact that communist members plan to use armed riots as a means of revolution is evident in the open statements of communist civil servants. A teacher advised his classmates: "We must learn to hate the capitalist class, without hatred there is no struggle. We...the vanguard of the working class, must teach the workers to learn to hate... Facing bloodshed, we must make the blood splash on the streets, just as they washed Russia with blood, the workers must be organized, so that they can avoid failure when the revolution comes." The Communist Party almost unanimously believes that the revolution will not rise unless a "major crisis" such as a general strike comes, an external war can be transferred to a civil war or an economic panic?</p>
<p>We get a hint from this, that as long as we continue to work in a democratic way of life, the "major crisis" that the Communist Party never forgets will never come.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has especially regulated its consciousness for all party members. The Workers' Daily quoted Stalin as saying: "We thoroughly apply the methods that Lenin tried to use to cover the consciousness of party members... a party member absolutely obeys party discipline, contributes party fees and his job and work to the organization."</p>
<p>If we cannot have a broad understanding and understanding of the purposes and plans of the Communist Party, we cannot effectively suppress the coercion of the Communist Party. This understanding will drive the Communist Party out of the hearts of good American citizens. But where will this kind of information come from?</p>
<p>The American Press</p>
<p>And the broadcasting industry is very alert to defend against the threat of red fascism, and has done a commendable job of exposing the evils of the Communist Party. We are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>I have noticed that speakers generally carefully use the name "Communist Party." It is a deceptive and dangerous move to apply the name "Communist Party" to those honest, upright American liberals and progressives, and the reason is only a difference of opinion. We must clearly distinguish between liberals and recognized communists. Although the Communist Party has flaunted that they are progressive, these millions of pure free and progressive people are the most powerful and decisive enemies of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and many specialized books that comment on communists are the most accurate sources of information. These will provide patriotic citizens with reliable facts.</p>
<p>Recent Congress</p>
<p>Interest in the Communist Party problem has been renewed, as can be seen from the activities of the House of Representatives "Committee to Investigate Actions Against the Interests of the American People". This committee is responsible for publishing facts about the activities of non-American forces within the United States. That work must also be obtained through the cooperation of loyal and patriotic Americans.</p>
<p>The committee has many valuable reference materials in its files, which, if used carefully, can be the best source of information for the referees. As for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it must keep all its files absolutely confidential.</p>
<p>American citizens must pay attention to all the facts related to their class. They must maintain a strong interest in and close attention to the organization of all the machines related to them and the schools that their children attend, and even what kind of people they are who are elected as public servants by the people in their trade unions.</p>
<p>Every citizen has the right and the responsibility to elect those who are loyal to the American way of life to take on the affairs of the country. A civil servant in a local government, state government, or federal government who is not loyal to the country may have a harmful effect on the country due to his treasonous behavior or the promotion of Marxist philosophy. Because the Communist Party claims that they are a political party, they should have the right to participate in the government, such as the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, etc.; in fact, they are only a part of the staff of an international criminal conspiracy, they are simply</p>
<p>Not a Political Party</p>
<p>—Trade unions have always been the goal of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has not forgotten Lenin's teachings: "In order to infiltrate the trade unions and progress and publicize communism, we will spare no sacrifice and use all methods, even if it is in conflict with the law, but we can skillfully conceal it and strive to achieve the goal." The American view of trade unions, as James Gambas said: "To be a good trade union member, one must first be a good American."</p>
<p>Communist members in trade unions—like Communist Parties everywhere—are subject to the orders of the highest authorities of the Communist Party. They absurdly conflate the purpose of the Communist Party with the purpose of labor and regard them as the same.</p>
<p>The Communist Party is the majority who are not affiliated with trade unions. At a recent Communist Party meeting, a labor leader admitted that Communist Party members only account for a local area</p>
<p>Union Members</p>
<p>Eighteen to nineteen percent of the number of people. In a union with 10,000 members, only 500 Communist Party members controlled the entire union. In another union, 8,500 members attempted to rescue the union from the hands of the Communist Party and failed, and the union only had 100 Communist Party members. What's more, a Communist Party member was able to influence the resolutions of the union meeting by using his hands.</p>
<p>Thoughtful American trade union members, if they are as concerned about trade union affairs as the Communist Party, may soon avoid the threat of the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Small Country in Southeast Asia - Strange News from Sarawak - The Overseas Chinese Vote Determines Which Faction Rules the Country</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou, 4th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu of this newspaper</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from the Min and Guangdong provinces have footprints all over the islands of Southeast Asia. The Communist Party of China (CPC) controls the economic power of various overseas Chinese settlements, and also has a pivotal force in the rise and fall of local society. The reporter had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Wang Shiqin, a member of the overseas Chinese community who had just returned from the conquered country of Sarawak, who explained the process of the conquest of this small kingdom of Sarawak in great detail. The unique style and system of the country involved in it made people yearn for the ideal of the Republic of Maratha. In particular, the way in which an overseas Chinese vote determined the fate of Sarawak was quite interesting. Domestic newspapers have not yet publicized this, and few people in China know about it. I am writing this article to introduce it to the readers.</p>
<p>A Small and Abundant Country</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Sarawak was established in North Borneo, with an area of ​​almost 202,000 square kilometers, equivalent to a province in Guangdong. The country is divided into six provinces, and each province is divided into several counties. The capital is Kuching. There are many rivers in the territory, which is convenient for transportation. The population is about 340,000, about the same as Fuzhou. Among them, there are 70,000 to 80,000 Malaysians, more than 150,000 Dyaks (a brown indigenous people), and more than 110,000 overseas Chinese. The famous Sarawak reclamation movement in the 19th century was led by Huang Naishang from Minqing to colonize the land. Therefore, there are quite a few overseas Chinese throughout Sarawak. It is said that 105 years ago, British sailors arrived in Sarawak, occupied the area and established a kingdom, and lived there as kings. So far, it has been passed down to the third generation, ruled by Raja. Because of its small size, it has not had formal diplomatic relations with other countries. The domestic industry and commerce are quite developed. The agricultural products are mainly tobacco, fruits, wood, and rubber. The wood produced is called "Billiam," which is as hard as iron and does not rot for thousands of years. It is truly a treasure. The minerals are rich in gold, iron, and oil, among which the oil reserves are considerable. The oil source of the British Asian Petroleum Company mainly comes from the media fields in Sarawak. The gold reserves are also considerable, but they have not been mined extensively. The country has a vast territory and a sparse population, and the products are abundant, which also makes people's lives quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Officials Are Diligent and People Abide by the Law</p>
<p>This country claims that the country is peaceful and the people are prosperous, and the king is tolerant. Any people can meet with him. Administrative officials at all levels in the government often come into contact with the people, and widely solicit their opinions. There is no bureaucratic habit, the political atmosphere is simple and honest, and the relationship between officials and people is very good. People abide by the law and become a model. Even if they accidentally break the law, they all know to surrender to the court. There are few cases of wanted fugitives or arrests. Criminals sentenced to imprisonment can ask for leave to go home to visit their relatives, without having to find a guarantor. The court escorts criminals without the need for bailiffs, and only needs a piece of official document for the criminals to take to report themselves. There are very few cases of violations, and social order is stable. The government economizes on expenses and does not easily increase taxes to burden the people, and the people rarely evade taxes or smuggle. In the commercial market, credit is sought. It is difficult to guarantee the rootedness of the system on the land of Sarawak, which fully demonstrates the ideal of "emphasizing credit and cultivating harmony" in the world of Datong.</p>
<p>Owed War Debts and Relinquished the Throne</p>
<p>When the Pacific War broke out, Sarawak was also affected. At that time, King Ula Zha led the local Dyak natives to wage guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army, with British aircraft as cover, annihilating many enemies. The natives were brave and good at fighting, and it was their honor to cut off the heads of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in Southeast Asia mentioned the Sarawak Dyak natives and all were silent. However, in the process of several years of war, Sarawak incurred a war debt of more than 20 million gold pounds to the United Kingdom. After the war, Sarawak was unable to repay such a huge amount. King Ula Zha, on the one hand, said that the United Kingdom was urgently demanding payment and could not be delayed. On the other hand, he did not want to increase taxes to burden the people. Under these two difficulties, last year, the King of Sha decided to hand Sarawak over to British rule as the price for repaying this war debt. The British had long coveted Sarawak's resources, and they also intended to accept it. When the time came, the King's younger brother protested to London, requesting that Britain should not take advantage of the danger to infringe upon Sarawak's independent sovereignty. As a result, two factions were formed in Sarawak, one supporting and one opposing the cession of independent sovereignty to Britain. The former was led by the King, and the latter was led by the King's younger brother, and a fierce political struggle began.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Vote Caused the Demise of Sarawak</p>
<p>Finally, it was submitted to public opinion, and a public vote was held by the parliament. Before the vote, the strengths of the two sides were evenly matched, and the number of votes held by the two factions was exactly equal. Only the neutral overseas Chinese members' votes were the focus of competition. As a result, this overseas Chinese vote agreed to return to Britain. The Kingdom of Sarawak, which had enjoyed 105 years of history, was declared dead. King Ula Zha abdicated, and the British sent a governor to take over. This small kingdom has since fallen into colonial status and been included in the territory of the British Empire.</p>
<p>The people abide by the law and value credit, and the government is benevolent and close to the people. Although Sarawak is an insignificant small country, it has its own perfect and ideal society. From now on, it will be reduced to a colonial status, losing the spirit of independence and autonomy. We sincerely regret this. In particular, it is a strange thing that in the postwar world, when the weak nations of the world have launched a wave of national self-determination, they have actually handed over the sovereignty of the country to others.</p>
<p>The Leader of the American Communist Party, Dennis, Has Stopped Activities</p>
<p>Dennis, the general secretary of the American Communist Party, once organized the "Un-American Activities Committee" and vigorously promoted communism in the United States, and carried out fierce struggles in various production sectors. Later, due to attacks from the U.S. government and various sectors of society, its activities began to stagnate.

<h3>On the Responsibility of Ship Owners</h3>
<p>— Wei Wenhan</p>
<p>Following the collision between the warship Fubo and the merchant vessel Hai Min, the captain of the Hai Min was detained. In addition to appealing to all parties, the families of the victims of the Fubo directly requested relief from the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the owner of the Hai Min. The manager of Liji Industrial Company was beaten and bled due to a labor dispute involving sailors. After the Zhongya steamer caught fire near Jiujiang, the families of the victims gathered and beat up the agent company. These incidents have been repeatedly published in prominent positions in various newspapers, arousing public attention to the issue of ship owners' responsibilities. The shipping business, like other businesses, is legally protected by national laws. However, in terms of its nature, it is a business containing risk. For example, wind and waves, tides, rain, fog, reefs, and other unavoidable collisions and strandings. Therefore, since the beginning of the ancient transportation industry, the rights and obligations of both ship and cargo have been stipulated. If the cargo is packaged, there are charter party agreements. If the cargo is shipped in small quantities, there are bills of lading. These regulations are based on conventions among maritime nations around the world. The most recent conference was held in 1922 in Brussels, Belgium. Based on these regulations, the United Kingdom enacted and promulgated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act in 1924. The provisions of Section 4, Paragraph 2, are attached as follows:</p>
<p>Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising from the following:</p>
<p>A: Any unintentional or negligent act by the captain, crew, pilot, or employees of the carrier in the management of the ship or in navigating the ship.</p>
<p>B: Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier.</p>
<p>C: All perils, dangers, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.</p>
<p>D: Act of God (force majeure).</p>
<p>E: War.</p>
<p>F: Act of public enemies.</p>
<p>G: Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or people, or seizure or arrest under legal process.</p>
<p>H: Quarantine restrictions.</p>
<p>I: Any act or omission of shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative.</p>
<p>J: Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from whatever cause, whether partial or general.</p>
<p>K: Riots and civil commotions.</p>
<p>L: Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea.</p>
<p>M: Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods.</p>
<p>N: Insufficiency of packing.</p>
<p>O: Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks.</p>
<p>P: Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence.</p>
<p>Q: Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.</p>
<p>The above provisions are followed by various maritime nations, and our country should not be an exception.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the transportation of passengers and the injury or death of persons, since there are no regulations similar to bills of lading between the ship and the injured party, the rights and obligations of both parties are difficult to define. However, shipping is essentially a risky business, and many factors are beyond human control. Accidents and negligence are difficult to avoid. In principle, the above cargo transportation regulations should be followed. If a death occurs and the captain is immediately detained and charged with murder, and the ship owner is threatened with being beaten, the important transportation business will be seen as a dangerous path. This is truly not a blessing for the country and society. Therefore, our country must adopt fair laws and regulations of various maritime nations, enforce the law with reason, and make reasonable dispositions. Captains all hold licenses and perform their duties, and there is no risk of escape. Ship owners have ships and sufficient assets as collateral, and should not be detained for every matter, hindering the performance of duties and impeding transportation. Furthermore, the liability of ship owners for damages caused by ships is also limited. Article 23, Paragraph 1 of our country's Maritime Law clearly stipulates:</p>
<p>(Note: This article originates from the 1915 International Maritime Convention) The maximum liability borne by the ship owner is the value of the ship itself, the freight for that voyage, and the amount of compensation received for damages.</p>
<p>As for the employment of crew members, ship owners should have the freedom to hire without coercion or threat from any party. The establishment of labor unions is a legal organization. Its original intention should be to strengthen internal unity and improve service efficiency, and there should be no intention to force employers to hire. Even if the union is fighting for the right of introduction, it should strengthen its own organization and improve service efficiency so that employers are willing to accept its introduction and increase the close cooperation between employers and employees.</p>
<p>At this time when the National Federation of Shipping Associations is holding its inaugural meeting and people across the country are paying attention to shipping, it is hoped that our country's administrative and judicial authorities will follow the practices of advanced maritime nations and not place excessive burdens on ship owners. It is also hoped that labor union leaders will guide sailors onto the right track in order to achieve sincere cooperation between ship owners and employees.</p>

<h3>Examples of Song Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Shui Chan</p>
<p>Edited by Chen Feishi, printed by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>This is a collection of lyrics recently published by Zhengzhong Book Company, included in the University Series. The author had previously used this book to teach others. The preface states the reason for writing the book: "In recent years, I have been forced to lecture on this subject, and the time is limited. It is not easy to condense a thousand miles into a foot, and to express vastness in an inch of heart. Moreover, it is unbearable to waste time in vain... Therefore, I first selected several poems from the twelve Song masters, attached my own revisions and annotations, and added my own humble opinions for the students to study, calling it 'Examples of Song Lyrics'." This book has not only been used by the author himself, but also borrowed by friends as a teaching material, and is indeed the best introductory book for learning lyrics.</p>
<p>This book selects six masters from the Southern Song Dynasty and six from the Northern Song Dynasty. The first rule in the general introduction states: "In my opinion, when learning lyrics, one should start with the Southern Song Dynasty and then the Northern Song Dynasty, and finally with the Five Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty. Modern historians use the method of reverse tracing. I follow this example, starting with Zhang Yan and ending with Yan Jidao, arranging them in chronological order, with the later ones in the front and the earlier ones in the back, so that one can go from the broad to the concise, and seek the source along the way." The six masters of the Southern Song Dynasty are Zhang Yan, Wang Yisun, Wu Wenying, Jiang Kui, Shi Dazu, and Xin Qiji. The author believes that "Ge Shunqing took Shi, Jiang, Wu, Zhou, Wang, and Zhang as the six masters, Zhou Yagui took Jiang, Shi, Wu, Wang, Jiang, and Zhang as the six masters, and Zhou Zhi'an took Xin, Wang, and Wu as the leaders. However, Jiang Jie's sense of life experience is the same as Wang and Zhang, and his carving skills originated from Wu. Zhou Mi also attached Tang to Wu," so all were abandoned. As for "Shi Dazu, he followed Qingzhen so closely that his every frown and smile were exactly the same. Although he was not an original creator, he was unmatched in this style after the Southern Crossing, so I dare not abandon him." The author's intention is to have beginners "first seek the elegant and upright sound from Zhang and Wang, use Wu to refine their breath, use Jiang to expand their mind, use Xin to strengthen their strength, and refer to Shi to look to the halls of the Northern Song Dynasty." The six masters of the Northern Song Dynasty are Zhou Bangyan, Qin Guan, Su Shi, He Zhu, Liu Yong, and Zhang Jidao. The author does not want to follow Ge and Zhou in using Zhou Bangyan to represent the others, thinking that "the guidance of the pioneers is not limited to one family. Su Shi's implications are lofty and his writing is ethereal. Qin Guan is elegant and graceful, and is a prominent master. He Zhu's skill in washing away the vulgar and his wonderful use of transformation are the sources of Zhou and Wu. Xiaoxuan is the conclusion of more than a hundred years. Liu Yong's lofty rhymes, strong rhymes, profound and majestic places, and subtle understandings are beyond the reach of others. The style of slow lyrics was also formed by Liu. The four are all taken by Zhou as models, and scholars should devote themselves to them." As for the Northern Song Xiaoxuan, the author only takes Yao Jidao as "the mainstay," from which to trace back to Li, Feng, Zhang, and Wen, "the torch is passed on, and the origin is easy to trace."</p>
<p>The whole book contains a total of fifty-three lyrics, twenty-seven from the Southern Song Dynasty and twenty-six from the Northern Song Dynasty, which is truly refined and concise. Each master is recorded with their life stories and the origins of their versions. Each poem is first attached with notes, then examined for rhythm, and then discussed in terms of lyrics. Each master is given their origin, and each lyric is given its essence. The author claims that "although one corner is small, it may be able to infer the other three; although the origin is small, it will eventually converge into the sea, because I want scholars to be able to infer other things of the same kind, and from this they can read, understand, and eventually be able to create." The author deeply regrets that lyricists "either refuse to reveal their secrets, or disdain to write them down, or else write fleeting and incomprehensible words, or pick up superficial theories, which are often chaotic and unorganized, so scholars grope and knock on the table, without knowing the mysteries, knowing the sentence but not the whole, knowing the whole but not the chapter." Therefore, he spares no effort to pass on his golden needles and write this book. Scholars who study it carefully will not have to worry about not being able to enter the room.</p>
<p>This book was originally a printed lecture note. It was written in 1927, and Xu Zhongke saw it and urged the author to publish it, but it did not come to fruition. It was hidden in a box for more than ten years. Later, the author fled to Sichuan to avoid the invaders, "and met Qiao Dazhuang in a cave, and they discussed it together, managing and overseeing it, as if they did not hear the rumble of the clouds." This was in October 1941. It took another six years before this book was seen. In the meantime, there have been many additions and deletions, which are slightly different from the original.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Sociology</h3>
<p>— Na Ya</p>
<p>Humans cannot survive alone without society. Everyone knows this in this era. People can only survive in society, and everything in our society is complex and intricate. Therefore, we must understand this colorful society and strive to improve and reform a rational and happy social life.</p>
<p>This book first tells us about the relationship between society and people, and what the meaning of the ever-changing society is - here, it explains that everything in society is in a more or less changing progress; as well as the era of human struggle in the ever-changing society, to the era of human conquest of nature; and then explains the connection between the various eras and stages of human society.</p>
<p>Next, it explains the driving force of social development, as well as the contrast between the two worlds of capitalism and socialism. Although the explanation is very simple, it is very accurate.</p>
<p>Then, it talks about what kind of society China is. The author points out the backwardness of Chinese society, whether in economic or cultural aspects, the author clearly points out. Regarding the uneven development of Chinese society and its nature, the author also has very clear explanations.</p>
<p>Finally, in the conclusion, the author emphasizes that the development of Chinese society is to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>In order to avoid too many redundancies, I have only briefly introduced the main points of the book's content, and cannot cite the original text to elaborate on the content. This book is called "Introduction to Sociology", and the name is consistent with the reality. It is a preliminary path to lead us to study sociology.

<h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Written by Lin Liru, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>In the past ten years or so, domestic scholars have had three distinct perspectives on the study of educational philosophy. The first is a description from the schools of philosophical problems, culminating in the application of education. The aim is to organize the relationship between philosophy and education into a system so that the implementation of education can be based on philosophy. Second, to criticize one by one based on philosophical principles, to see whether the implementation of education is based on sound philosophical theory. Most people use this method to study educational principles. The third is to regard education and philosophy as two sides of the same coin, which are inextricably linked. People who hold this research attitude particularly emphasize the connection between educational philosophy and practical educational experience.</p>
<p>Practice cannot be separated from theory</p>
<p>Currently, the published monographs on educational philosophy are all written according to the first and second perspectives mentioned above. Few people study the third perspective, putting theory and method into one furnace, emphasizing the connection between philosophy and education, and there are no special books published. Recently, I read "Educational Philosophy" by Mr. Lin Liru, and I feel that it can meet the needs of the general public.</p>
<p>This is a manuscript compiled by the author in the winter of 1944 after the Japanese invaders successively captured Guilin and Liuzhou, and the Guilin Normal College went to Guizhou along the river. In addition to the "Talks on Educational Philosophy" published by the World Publishing House in September 1944 (written by traditional predecessors), Lin's book can be regarded as the only new work on educational philosophy in China. The characteristic of this book, in a word, is that the thoughts are systematic and have a center. In today's poor publishing industry, it is indeed a good book worth recommending.</p>
<p>Facing a new era, how should we grasp the progressive educational philosophy as a guide for educational implementation? This is what we must carefully consider. In the first lecture of the book, "Introduction", the author explains that it is impossible to abandon philosophical speculation and adopt an experimental and empirical attitude, and to pursue purely empirical scientific pedagogy. Because education is not a purely science, it must have a sound theoretical basis as a guide for practice, so as not to go in the wrong direction. "Correct philosophy starts from objective reality and explores its inherent laws from objective reality." This is worth remembering. The author also proposes the objectivity, practicality, class character and combativeness of educational philosophy. He gives educational philosophy the following definition: "Educational philosophy is a practical philosophy that explores the objective laws formed in the human world from the inevitable process of social growth, development and evolution."</p>
<p>Essence</p>
<p>The book first looks at the essence of education from the growth of human beings. Education is regarded as the learning activity of human society. Growth is developed in labor and practice. Education is also regarded as a social function, because human beings cannot leave education in order to adapt to social life, and the process of social life inevitably produces educational effects.</p>
<p>Regarding the purpose of education, most people put it on external powers and high success, which is too far away from the experience and life of the educated. However, education must have a purpose, because educational activities must avoid blind activities. We should "see countless relationships and countless interacting forces from the overall social life, and there are always starting points for improving human nature and many ways to achieve the goal."</p>
<p>Speaking of the effectiveness of education, the author first talks about the role of education for the educated, and especially emphasizes the great influence of the cultural environment of human society on the development of people's minds. Heredity is only a possible tendency, and its development is still determined by the environment. The effectiveness of education is immeasurable, as long as the educational role played by various social functions can meet the purpose that education should have, and various educational roles with different trends can be coordinated with each other under the principle of adapting to the development of human nature, the effectiveness of education will be displayed.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>After talking about the principles, let's talk about the method. The educational method is also the process of practice and learning activities. From the history of human evolution, we can see that education is everywhere in the practice process of human society. Dewey does not deny the practicality of learning. The author repeatedly states that educational methods and materials must be matched. If the method is mistakenly regarded as an isolated existence, it will fall into the mire of idealism. He said it well: "The method is really the way that people understand the relationship of natural changes, and thus use it to control natural changes in order to achieve the goal." Regarding learning methods, psychology has made the greatest contribution. He cited the learning psychological method provided by Gestalt psychology, which is "insight" into the situation. The quality of the learning method depends entirely on whether the learner can see the details related to the specific purpose in a specific situation. From this, the author points out that the difficulty or hindrance of learning is due to the fact that the various interrelated details in the environment are hidden and not easily grasped. The complexity of the phenomenon is of course a reason, but most of it is still due to errors in practice. Sincere and lasting practice is the only way to discover the truth and the only way to learn anything.</p>
<p>New trends in educational research</p>
<p>After reading this "Educational Philosophy", you will definitely feel the educational theory. The educational philosophy proposed by the author is based on dialectics, and the social view of education is recognized very correctly. In the last lecture, "An Overview of the Evolution of Modern Education", four valuable arguments are mentioned again: such as (1) What pedagogy wants to study is not limited to the tangible school education facilities, but to regard education as the process of personality growth and the process of social growth and development. (2) The foundation of pedagogy should be extended to various cultural sciences and draw on all sciences. (3) The status of pedagogy is not limited to applied science, but must develop into an independent science with its own position and autonomy. (4) The research of pedagogy should go beyond principles and methods, and further explore the laws of personality growth in the transformation of social growth and development, then explain the laws of historical and social educational phenomena.</p>
<h3>Family Education</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chuanwen</p>
<p>Written by Chen Heqin, published by Huahua Bookstore</p>
<p>The remarkable feature of this book is that it explains and explains the specialized knowledge of child psychology and education with simple and clear examples. The problems raised in it are what every parent encounters and what every parent needs to get answers to.</p>
<p>Domestic educators have written many specialized and excellent books on children's education, but it is rare to find a book that embodies specialized theories in simple and concrete examples and elaborates on them, making readers feel as if they are not reading a book or listening to a lecture. Mr. Chen's book can be regarded as a rare one. The whole book is more than 220 pages long, with a text of no more than 300,000 words, but the richness of the content included is almost all-encompassing. It makes the reader feel as if they are sitting in an educator's laboratory, watching him teach and caress children. The main objects of the author's research are his own two children, and he also cites the children of his friends as examples. With the attitude of a child educator and a loving father, he stands in an objective position and gives enthusiastic guidance and calm observation, so the examples from the students are very kind and approachable, and the interest is overflowing.</p>
<p>The author first points out the characteristics of children's psychology, and awakens readers to pay attention to the various behaviors that occur with the development of children's various psychological states, and what kind of education methods are needed to guide them. For example, children's nature is to imitate and be curious. Parents should not only understand that this nature is good, is the key to children's knowledge, but also must go on to guide them step by step, lead him to the right and broad road, and cultivate his spirit of pursuing and researching external things. For example, children like to play, parents should make children have playmates and participate in group life, and give play to his happy nature.</p>
<p>The author also explains the basic principles of children's learning. Due to children's innate abilities, that is, the gradual development and growth of sensation, association, and action, so the implementation of education should be based on the stage of psychological development and give appropriate education. Children's learning is to first feel external stimuli, then combine what they feel with all the feelings, and then generate corresponding actions to respond to external stimuli. This basic principle of learning actually includes the central ideas and principles of all children's education. The author elaborates on this principle, applies it to the actions and behaviors of children's daily life, and takes this as the guide for the entire principle of educational implementation. The author can also use simple and clear examples to repeatedly explain and explain this principle, so that readers can understand it and understand it at a glance. If the author has not personally practiced it and put himself into the field of children for precise objective research and observation, he would never be able to do it, and this point may be the biggest feature of this book.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned basic principles of children's learning, the author especially makes readers pay attention to the fact that parents should give children appropriate stimuli, so that they have a good environment, guide the children's reactions, correct their mistakes, and consolidate all the children's associations, so that they can develop effective actions.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that this book is too ordinary and trivial, and what it describes are all platitudes. That's right, the object of family education is lively and innocent children, and its nature is ever-changing and different in an instant. Is it better to explain it with formulaic principles or with actual and concrete examples? The most salable point of this book is that the author pays attention to observation, supervision and instruction in daily life, and obtains vivid examples and experiences. These examples and experiences can be explained by educational principles, but they may not be completely regulated and restricted. In other words, the examples in this book are obtained from innocent and lively children, not from empty and rigid theories. In short, this book is not a lecture in a school classroom, not a speech by scholars and experts, it is a lively and interesting description of ordinary daily events. School teachers can use this book as a textbook for education subjects, and family parents can use this book as a practical guide for educating their children. The author does not know Mr. Chen, and has no intention of deliberately promoting it, but I hope that all parents will have a copy and see what it tells you, which is exactly what you hope to get answers to day and night.</p>
<h3>"Soaring People"</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ren</p>
<p>Compiled and translated by Jiang Si, published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>In the current stage of paper being expensive in Luoyang, children's books and juvenile books do not seem to be as vigorous and energetic as they were in previous years. This reflects the gradual decline and demise of children's literature, which is a loss to both the youth themselves and the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Recently, we are very excited to see "Soaring People" compiled and translated by Jiang Zong, just as Wei Bingxin said in the preface: "Of course, this is not a great work, but compared to the shoddy and poorly made goods that are copied from the east and west, it is at least one level higher." This is the truth. The stories compiled and translated in the whole book are about scientists, educators, and great men of the times, and are full of the central ideas of being positive, progressive, optimistic, and liberating. For a successful person, it does not exhaust its task of preaching, but tells the younger generation with the relaxed and lively tone of literature, with what kind of successful trajectory, depicting the facts of implying struggle to subdue the environment. Zhu Yixin said in the preface: "We use the active stories of human beings to provide mental food for young people, and undoubtedly we should choose these materials." I agree with his words and also congratulate the young people.</p>
<p>I am a youth now, and I think everyone should cherish his youth, this is a book that encourages you to work hard and fly up. It is a book about people's struggle with the environment and victory. I sincerely recommend it to young people and parents.</p>
<h3>Critique of "Night Play"</h3>
<p>— Keng Qiang</p>
<p>(Written by Nie Gannu, published by Gaijin Publishing House)</p>
<p>Mr. Nie Gannu is known for his essays. His essays are sharp and powerful, carrying a bit of a "Lu Xun style." Originally, I always felt that someone who writes essays is not suitable for writing novels, thinking that the sharp tone is somewhat incompatible with novels. However, after I finished reading this book "Night Play," my view completely changed. I realized that someone who writes essays is also suitable for writing novels, especially short stories.</p>
<p>"Night Play" contains five short stories, and naturally, all five short stories have substance. Unlike some short story writers who often like to include one or two bad ones among several good stories, like a butcher selling meat with bones. Among the five short stories here, two are about the scenery of Sichuan during the Anti-Japanese War, two are about the work of political workers, and one is about a simple story behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the scenic pieces in "Night Play" are successful in expressing emotions. For example, the first piece, "Wine Boat," is a good example. Here, the author almost paints a picture, depicting all the scenery along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From this, we can see the stuffy wine boat, which is like a small cigarette shop, with colorful cigarettes on the shelves. Next to the shelves is a counter with wine bottles, teacups, pickles, and oily noodles. At the head of the counter is a charcoal stove cooking something, and on the other side are two square tables and benches, with several people sitting there chatting. Such a scene is very familiar to anyone who has been to Sichuan and can easily evoke memories.</p>
<p>However, in another piece, Mr. Nie's true feelings are still successful, which is the last piece, "Younger Brother." Here, he arranged two tragic characters: an older brother who is strong and cares about face, but also cares about the country; and a younger brother who is lured by the sinful society and willingly degenerates. The older brother has thousands of contradictions in his heart. When he returns home from afar and sees the bare walls and his beggar-like younger brother, he is very angry. Why would a young man degenerate to such a state? But when he thinks about it, remembering that the person standing in front of him is his own brother, and thinking about how corrupt society was at the time, making it difficult for young people to control themselves, he forgives his younger brother. He says that as long as his younger brother is willing to listen to him and get rid of those self-deprecating habits, he can take him out, find him a job, and find him a wife. But what is the result? The older brother's hopes are dashed. A person who voluntarily jumps into the river cannot be pulled ashore. This piece reminds us of the Italian writer Giovanni Papini's "Prodigal Son," but the protagonist in "Prodigal Son" eventually repents, while the protagonist in "Younger Brother" eventually sinks deeper and deeper into the quagmire. This is the difference between a comedy and a tragedy. Although we cannot say that Mr. Nie Gannu's work can surpass Giovanni Papini's, he has at least ensured that Papini does not have a monopoly on this subject.</p>
<p>Comparable to "Younger Brother" is "Night Play." Here, a petite bourgeois woman is depicted. She is the daughter of the village chief, and she wants to do national salvation work, but she also dislikes being with a group of "vulgar" villagers. She has the reserve of a young girl, but she also believes that love is more important than work in life. There are many such women in China. During the war, how often did we see a petite bourgeois woman who ate well and dressed well participating in national salvation work? Shouting slogans may be their forte, but the actual work is done by those simple, earthy villagers.</p>
<p>In terms of content, this is a realistic short story collection. There is almost no shadow of fantasy in the five stories. Originally, in such an era where everything is in a precarious state of flux, what can a writer rely on to ease their conscience and write some frivolous articles to gloss over the situation?</p>
<h3>Introduction to Cai's Criminology</h3>
<p>— Ting Guang</p>
<p>(Criminology, by Cai Shuhang, priced at six yuan, published by Independent Publishing House.)</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, due to social and economic changes caused by external factors, Chinese jurisprudence also embarked on a new path. However, for decades, in the field of Chinese jurisprudence, especially in the area of criminology, there have been few works that do not simply imitate Western works in a formalistic way, but are able to conduct in-depth explorations of Chinese history and society, and are actively constructed into a system by the author himself! Until recently, we were able to read a satisfactory book: the first volume of this Criminology by Cai.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five chapters: Chapter 1: Criminology, Chapter 2: Criminological Thought, Chapter 3: Criminal Law, Chapter 4: Chinese Criminal Law, and Chapter 5: The Position of Criminal Law in the Legal System. It not only emphasizes concepts but also strives to reflect social reality and fully express the author's personal thoughts and opinions. In the section on the development of Chinese criminological thought in Chapter 2, the author launches a stern critique of the tax laws of previous generations. Based on his personal observations and research on the historical and social background of China, he presents us with a path that Chinese criminal law should take in the future! In the section on the rational form of Chinese criminal law in the future in Chapter 4, he expresses boundless hope.</p>
<p>He puts forward some unique insights in this book. For example, although the Great Qing New Criminal Law promulgated in the second year of Xuantong is generally considered to belong to the type of criminal law in the scientific period, he points out that the promulgation of the Great Qing New Criminal Law was the beginning of China's entry into a semi-colonial state and reflects China's semi-colonial nature. There are many other similar incisive arguments.</p>
<p>Overall, we can find that the author's consistent approach is to attempt to integrate the general principles of criminal law with the special provisions of criminal law, to connect theory with practice, to apply processes on the one hand, and to grasp the entirety of criminal law from the legal system on the other hand, in order to demonstrate the position of criminal law in the order of national and social life, and to integrate legal concepts, methodology, and ethics into one furnace, in order to enhance the philosophical and scientific nature of criminology. It is a pity that the writing is somewhat difficult to read, but it is indeed an unprecedented good book in the still nascent field of criminology. I hereby offer a sincere introduction, and hope that Mr. Cai will quickly fulfill what he told us in the preface about the second and third volumes that he is preparing to write but has not yet written, so that they can be published as soon as possible, in order to add some vitality to the currently impoverished field of jurisprudence and provide some progressive insights.</p>

<h3>Being Out of School and Unemployed</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>The summer vacation has just begun, and students and their parents are already worried about whether they can afford the huge tuition fees after the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Recently, schools often invent various names to squeeze money from students, especially private schools. Someone runs a school as if they are opening a bank, and the students are the targets of the "banker" (principal) to squeeze. There are school building fees, teacher training fees, compensation fees for damaged public property, Boy Scout uniform fees... There is a long list that is unclear. When the school term starts, the school takes in a huge amount of property, and then the profits roll over, the principal becomes the general manager, the principal's wife becomes the accounting director and cashier, and the students become "goods." The principal can do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>People who run schools for the sake of "making a fortune" are everywhere. This is not an exaggeration on our part.</p>
<p>Due to price fluctuations and insecurity in life, the fees for these private schools, and the payment items listed for the next semester, will definitely kick the children of the general middle and lower classes out of school.</p>
<p>It is estimated that a private middle school will have to pay at least two million or more next semester, and a private university is even unimaginable.</p>
<p>Because the fees for municipal and national schools are relatively low, taking Beiping alone, each municipal middle school has already reached 6,000 applicants, while the quota for municipal schools is only 200. May I ask how these many students will be accommodated?!</p>
<p>Shanghai is the place with the most students in the country. If the authorities do not make arrangements in advance, they will become students who are out of school in the student community, and in society, they will become unemployed.</p>
<p>According to estimates a few months ago, the number of unemployed people in Shanghai has exceeded two million. Now, if these young people with no education and no job really withdraw from school, you can imagine the serious consequences it will cause.</p>
<p>Being out of school is not a terrible thing in peacetime, but at this time and place, schools cannot accommodate them, and society cannot provide them with employment. What will these young people who wander the streets do?</p>
<p>Here, we don't need to propose any specific solutions, but we hope that the authorities can plan ahead and find a way out for them in advance!</p>

<h3>Sino-Mongolian Border Treaty</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>After the Beitashan Incident in Xinjiang, our country protested; at the same time, the Mongolian People's Republic recognized by our country also launched a counter-protest, and the Sino-Mongolian border issue attracted the attention of the world.</p>
<p>The government has lodged two protests and gathered experts from all sides for research. In the future, there will inevitably be a strong debate on the Sino-Mongolian border treaty and its demarcation, as can be proved by this Beitashan incident.</p>
<p>In history, the Qing Dynasty's successive treaties with Russia are probably the ones where a vast territory was lost in a muddle-headed and unconscious manner. Since the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 (the eighth year of Xianfeng), the Treaty of Beijing in 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), the Treaty of Tacheng in 1864 (the third year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Kobdo in 1869 (the eighth year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1870 (the ninth year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Ili in 1882 (the eighth year of Guangxu), and the Northeast Treaty of Kashgar, the Treaty of Kobdo and the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1883 (the ninth year of Guangxu), and the Northwest Treaty of Kashgar in 1884 (the tenth year of Guangxu). Every survey and every treaty invariably involved the secret cutting of land, and this cutting of land was done unconsciously. We cannot but sigh at the lack of geographical knowledge of the people in charge at the time.</p>
<p>Reports say that Soviet troops have entered Tacheng, but the news has not yet been confirmed. But we cannot help but think of the story of the Russian army occupying Ili under the pretext in 1871 (the tenth year of Tongzhi). However, the imperial Russia at that time still claimed that "China would recover Ili, and after Xinjiang was settled, it would be returned." When the Qing court protested, it claimed again that "the Russian government has no intention of annexing it, and when Chinese authority can be exercised in this area and the security of the national border can be guaranteed, it will be returned."</p>
<p>There will inevitably be many disputes in the future Sino-Mongolian border treaty. We think of the Qing Dynasty's successive treaties with Russia, which resulted in countless losses of territory, and we also think of the Qing Dynasty's failure to recover Ili and the incompetence of Chonghou and Zeng Jize, who were unable to recover rights and interests. Looking again at the colors of Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the nine eastern provinces on the map hanging on the wall, it is too late for our nation to rise up and become strong again.</p>
<p>It is not only necessary for the government to gather experts to study the Sino-Mongolian border and its treaty, but it must also be strengthened!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Manuscript Fees</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>Writing articles to earn manuscript fees is not something that started today. It's just that in today's world, there are all kinds of ways to make a living, and none is more clumsy than a writer using brainpower as capital for a "livelihood." Workers' salaries can still be adjusted monthly based on the cost of living index, but how can writers' compensation compete with "dao" and "magic"?</p>
<p>Manuscript fees used to be called "brush fees," based on the idea of "virtue enriches the person, wealth enriches the house." Its "enrichment" is limited to the brush, which can be said to be taking without harming integrity. In fact, according to the notes and novels, the huge "brush fees" of ancient writers are staggering. Song Hongjin's Miscellaneous Notes: "The practice of writers receiving brush fees has existed since the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasties, and it began in the Tang Dynasty; Pei Xiu received millions in gifts for his writing; Huangfu Shi wrote the Fuxian Temple stele for Pei Du, and was given carriages, horses, and colorful silks in great abundance, but Shi still thought it was too little, and Du also rewarded him with 9,000 bolts of silk. Bai Juyi wrote Yuan Zhen's epitaph, and was thanked with saddles, horses, fine silk, and jade belts, worth more than six or seven hundred thousand. When Pei Jun died, his son took ten thousand coins to Wei Guanzhi to ask for an inscription." People in the Tang Dynasty attached great importance to their posthumous reputation, and filial sons and virtuous grandsons had to seek "brushes as big as rafters" to write epitaphs and inscriptions for their ancestors. If writers did not take the opportunity to extort, it would not be enough to show their high value. "Millions of gifts" became a trend at that time. Tang History: "The system stipulated Tiaoer Temple; Pei Du wanted to ask Bai Juyi for an inscription, Shi was not happy, so he asked him to write it, and after drinking, he picked up the pen and finished it immediately." Even for such a "rushed" piece, he still complained that the reward was too little, and Prime Minister Pei actually added 9,000 bolts of silk at once, Huangfu Shi can be said to be greedy and insatiable.</p>
<p>Han Yu, known as "Qi Xiang Gong," specialized in writing epitaphs for high-ranking officials and nobles at that time, and his manuscript fee income was extremely high. Liu Yuxi's eulogy for Han Changli said: "The price of one word from you is like a mountain of gold." This can be proven. One day, his disciple Liu Wen saw Zhu Ti piled up on Changli's desk and said: "This is what you get from flattering the dead in the tomb, it's better to use it to drink wine." So he took it away directly. Liu Wen's petty theft can be said to be a humorous protest against his teacher's excessive manuscript fees!</p>
<p>Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, it has been difficult to expect millions in brush fees; Zhongwu Jiewen: "West of Yue Gate, there is Yao Min, known for his filial piety. His residence has the Three Auspices Hall, and Dongpo once wrote a poem for him. Yao sent incense to him as a gift, but Po did not accept it. He wrote to a friend: "Yao Jun is sincere and good at doing good deeds, and his intention is extremely commendable, but there is no need to leave things behind. I returned the eighty cans of incense, as if entrusting it back to him. I have already appreciated his kindness, and keeping it would be no different from accepting it, which is why I dare not keep it for other officials." This shows that Po Lao did not accept brush fees for writing poems and articles for others, which is much better than Paris.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Tang Yin often painted huge works and compiled the articles he wrote, calling them "profitable market," which shows that Jieyuan Gong not only wanted to earn manuscript fees for writing articles, but also wanted to "the more the better."</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Yuan Zicai's poems and articles could not be obtained without silver; a seven-character quatrain cost fifty taels of silver, and a regulated verse cost twice as much. Someone who wanted to have their name mentioned in the Suiyuan Poetry Talk had to offer a hundred taels of silver as a birthday gift. Yu Ji's manuscript fee for selling articles was also quite high, fifty taels for less than a thousand characters, and double that for more than a thousand characters. There is a poem that says: "The public tripod waits for the inscription price to be high, how can I be suitable for such a humble appearance? I only want to occupy a famous mountain seat, so that I can compete for the lyrics of Xia Li; I dare to be tired of saying it again and again, but because I am seventy years old and my strength is declining, although there are high-ranking people who laugh at me, I hope you will understand my little intention." It is filled with a humble heart, which makes people see the poet.</p>
<p>This kind of "brush fee" with a small poem seems to have been created by Zheng Banqiao. Banqiao's brush fee is for selling paintings, so I won't go into details. Since the Republic of China, there have been many scholars and artists in Shanghai, and there are excellent poems about brush fees. When Wang Xishen Yunzhang of Wuxi was selling articles in Shanghai, he once wrote a small poem about the brush fee: "Grinding ink is not a lonely task, the autumn heart rolls up the snow. I am ashamed that my family's tradition is to exchange red silks, and I personally learn from Banqiao." The imagery is exquisite, and one can imagine the person. As for Mr. Ji Zhiyan, who has long since passed away, he once wrote a poem about the brush fee: "Twenty years of wandering in Shanghai, drunkenly looking at the blue sky with white eyes, the rabbit escapes and his body is old, and he exchanges it for the money to sell his life in the world." The feeling of poverty and depression overflows beyond the brush and ink. When writers read it today, I am afraid they will sigh even more!</p>
<h3>A Scene of Hu Die in the New Film "Spring Dream"</h3>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>American Dollars and Nickels</p>
<p>Having returned to China, I am accustomed to large denominations of 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000 yuan, spending 3-4 million yuan on a suit, 200,000 yuan on a simple meal, and tens of millions of yuan for a small two-room apartment. Thinking that Americans only use a hundred or so dollars a month, it seems too shabby. American currency can be said to be quite standardized. The most common denominations in circulation are 1-dollar, 5-dollar, and 10-dollar bills. 2-dollar, 20-dollar, and 50-dollar bills are rarely seen. 100-dollar bills are practically useless. Many stores simply can't make change for a 100-dollar bill. Coins include the 25-cent Quarter, the 10-cent Dime, the 5-cent Nickel, and the 1-cent small copper coin. Even smaller is the Token used for taxes. One cent can buy four things. Before the war, America was known for having the highest standard of living, but now, cents and dimes have long disappeared in China, while Americans are still scraping by with nickels. Don't underestimate those 5-cent nickels; their uses are endless. Hundreds of things are sold for 5 cents: newspapers cost 5 cents each, soda costs 5 cents per bottle, beer costs 5 cents per bottle, streetcar tickets cost 5 cents to 1 dime, a pack of gum with 5 sticks costs 5 cents, coffee costs 5 cents per cup (sometimes a refill is free), oranges cost 5 cents each, small glass combs cost 5 cents each, yarn costs 5 cents per skein, postcards cost 3 for 5 cents, a cone of ice cream costs 5 cents, a small bag of breakfast crackers costs 5 cents, a box of bandages costs 5 cents, and playing the slot machine costs 5 cents per try. An even greater variety of goods cost 1 dime: lipstick costs 1 dime each, toothpaste costs 1 dime each, scented soap costs 1 dime per bar, greeting cards cost 1 dime each, celebrity photos cost 1 dime each, a dish of ice cream costs 1 dime, ink costs 1 dime per bottle, children's socks cost 1 dime per pair, hairpins cost 1 dime each, a peep show costs 1 dime per time, a watch strap costs 1 dime, and two slices of toast cost 1 dime. Even a single copper coin has many uses. Automatic scales cost 1 dime each, and they even give you a fortune slip, saying something about having a career, etc. The automatic peanut machine dispenses about ten peanuts per copper coin—no more, no less. Christmas seals for sealing letters cost 1 cent each, and matches cost 1 cent per box. (15)</p>
<h3>Talking About Hydropower Construction Amidst the Power Shortage</h3>
<p>— Ya</p>
<p>Electricity is as important to industry as water is to life. These days, the city is experiencing a power shortage again. More than 200 factories in Xujiahui have issued an urgent appeal, requesting electricity supply, otherwise, how will the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers be resolved? This problem is still a small problem for the entire Shanghai, but in this eventful autumn of the nation, Shanghai, which consumes a large amount of electricity (the current generation is 180,000 kilowatts, and the pre-war capacity was 260,000 kilowatts), will always face an industrial crisis if it relies solely on coal for power generation.</p>
<p>Norway has no coal deposits, but has many waterfalls. By utilizing hydropower, the average power generation is the highest in the world. The UK relies on coal for industrial electricity, and hydropower is scarce (only 240,000 kilowatts in England). If you haven't forgotten, last winter, heavy snow submerged their railways, causing a coal shortage. Fortunately, the air force was dispatched, and the crisis was narrowly averted.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of long-term planning for Shanghai's electricity consumption, we must try our best to use hydropower to liberate a portion of it. For example, the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River contain more than 10 million kilowatts, and can be transmitted westward to Chengdu and eastward to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Unfortunately, it requires a huge construction cost of 3-4 billion US dollars, resulting in a forced abandonment. The Qiantang River in Hangzhou, Qililong and other places, if funding is available, can be completed within six months to a year, with a power generation capacity of more than 150,000 kilowatts, which can be supplied to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Recently, it is said that the government has sent personnel to conduct surveys. Speaking of this, I can't help but think of the wealthy merchants of Shanghai and other places. Why are they addicted to gold and US dollars and engage in illegal speculation?</p>
<p>If they could contribute a portion of their financial resources to hydropower construction, the benefits to the people would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>According to a recent report by Chairman Weng, the total hydropower capacity of the country is 900,000 kilowatts (including 200,000 kilowatts in the Northeast. The reserves in the Northeast are 1.7 million kilowatts in the Songhua River, 1.6 million kilowatts in the Wusuli River, and 180,000 kilowatts in Taiwan. The reserves in Taiwan are more than 330,000 kilowatts). The United States currently has 50 million kilowatts. More than 60% of China's hydropower belongs to the Resources Committee, which shows that the people do not pay much attention to this. China may be like Norway, like the United States, but the country does not have much money, so the waterfalls and springs are only for people to appreciate. The planned Minjiang River in Fuzhou can be used to drive the local industry; the K.V.A. planned in the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi is being carried out by the central government with 700 million yuan, and it is expected to generate 25,000 kilowatts after completion; the Pearl River in Guangdong will be invested by an American company to establish the Pearl River Hydropower Plant; the Kangding River in Xikang has reserves of more than 150,000 kilowatts, which is enough for the entire province. After completion, the compatriots in the province will have the cheapest electricity in the country and engage in production. The funding is planned to be subsidized by loans from French banking groups. The Xuebao Mountain in Fenghua is also being considered for construction. Other waterfalls such as Yandang, Shiliang, etc., are noisy and shocking, and ten thousand horses are galloping, with a momentum of collapsing thousands of feet. It is hoped that they will be conquered in the near future, bringing great light to the local area and seeking happiness for the people.</p>
<h3>Sang Weihan's Iron Inkstone</h3>
<p>—  Ren</p>
<p>When I was studying in a private school as a child, I remember my grandfather buying me a lacquer-covered inkstone, which was shiny and engraved with the four characters "Grind Through Iron Inkstone" in clerical script. These four characters left a deep impression on me. At that time, I thought to myself, this inkstone is clearly made of stone, why does it have to be said to be made of iron? At that time, I was afraid of my elders, and I didn't dare to ask for the truth, so I kept it in my heart.</p>
<p>When I reached the point where I could also use allusions to write articles, I realized that anyone who can devote themselves to learning, be determined, and achieve something is called "grinding through an iron inkstone." At that time, I still knew it was so, but didn't know why it was so. When I was able to translate the Twenty-Four Histories, I understood even more thoroughly where this iron inkstone came from. It didn't come from any great sage, but from a very despicable Sang Weihan.</p>
<p>Sang Weihan drafted a memorial for Shi Jingtang, recognizing himself as a subject to the Khitan emperor, and requesting to serve him as a father. The nickname of Shi Jingtang as the Emperor Son originated under his plan. At that time, Liu Zhiyuan, who was on the side, earnestly persuaded Shi Jingtang: "It is permissible to call him a great country, but it is too much to serve him as a father; it is better to bribe him with gold and silk to cause his troops; it is not necessary to promise him land, for fear that it will cause great harm to China in the future, and it will be too late to regret it." But Shi Jingtang, who only trusted Sang Weihan, was not willing to listen. As a result, the Emperor Son was created, and the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun were completely offered to foreign tribes.</p>
<p>The Biography of Sang Weihan in the History of the Five Dynasties: "When Weihan first took the imperial examination, the examiner disliked his surname, thinking that Sang and mourning had the same sound. Someone advised him to seek officialdom elsewhere, but Weihan said with emotion, so he cast an iron inkstone to show people and said: "If the inkstone is worn out, then I will change and seek officialdom elsewhere." He eventually passed the imperial examination."</p>
<p>Sang Weihan's determination to take the so-called "orthodox path" was, of course, the ambition of a scholar. Like later scholars striving for fame in the imperial examination, wanting to stand out from the crowd in the examination hall with their articles, "ten years of cold window no one asks, one fell swoop fame the world knows," this is naturally something that promising people do, who says it is not appropriate.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the traditional thinking of "reading only for fame" harmed him. Although he finally made it to the top and became a high official, he inevitably left a name that could not be ground through on the pages of history. Sang Weihan, who vigorously advocated introducing the Khitans into Jin, even died at the hands of the Khitan masters because of this. This is truly a pitiful bug who introduced a wolf into the house and built a cocoon to trap himself!</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the modern poem "Studying to be a person with white hair by the pond," which is much better than the pitiful bug in the past who "Studying to be an official with white hair by the pond." Because those pitiful bugs who "grind through iron inkstones" not only make themselves pitiful bugs, but even implicate generations of descendants, who inevitably become pitiful bugs. This is truly wasting the hard work of "grinding through iron inkstones"!</p>
<p>A word to Sang Weihan's readers: wake up and turn back early.</p>
