<p>談及東北接收整理經過，氏稱：「東北爲日寇以華制華，以戰養戰之根據地，慘淡經營十有餘年，各項經濟建設，斐然可觀，舉其犖犖大者，如瀋陽之兵工廠，及鐵西工業區，吉林小豐滿之水力發電廠，長春之大隆科學院，公主嶺之農事試騐塲，盤山之開拓田，熊岳之菓樹園，以及撫順，阜新，本溪，鞍山之煤礦，鐵礦等、國內之工礦事業甚少堪與匹敵。自日本投降，政府即明令組織東北行營，重劃省區爲遼寗，安東，遼北，吉林，松江，合江，嫩江，黑龍江，興安九省，並發表九省二市人員從事接收工作。各部分接收人員，自三十四年十月九日先後到達長春之後，因蘇軍態度屢起變化，未按照中蘇條約之規定將佔領區政權移交我政府。更一再延期撤兵，同時非法份子乃得藉以組織武裝，擴張勢力，實行地方割據，阻撓接收。直至三十五年三月蘇軍撤退後，始隨國軍之進展，由錦州而瀋陽，四平，長春，吉林，以次及熟河，安東，絡續展開接收工作。此外哈爾濱，大連兩市，松江，嫩江，合江，黑龍江，興安五省，則仍在待命接收中。在政府接收之先，敵僞所遺留之工礦器材，重要物資以及東北人民之固有財物一部分已被蘇軍運走，一部分再遭共匪慘痛破壞，舊日精華，餘存不足十分之四。根據鮑萊調查團報吿，在蘇軍佔領期中，東北工廠所遭受之直接損傷已達八五八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。如以修復費加入估計，至少當達二十億美元。目下瀋陽兵工廠，撫順煤礦，鞍山鐵礦，小豐滿發電廠（未收復省區尙無調查）。本溪湖煤鐵公司等，現所留存者，僅陳舊機器與破爛廠房而已。政府接收後，經濟方面，特別置重於重建一般經濟秩序，調節物價，力謀恢復生產，安定人民生活。茲將重要工作分述於后：</p>
<p>甲，金融方面：中央銀行發行東北九省流通券與偽滿鈔券等値使用，惟在流通券發行之先，國軍爲應付各項經費起見，曾將所携帶之法幣，加蓋東北保安司令長官部之印記，俗稱「蓋印法幣」，與僞滿券等値行使流通劵發行後，乃開始整理幣制：（一）整理蘇軍票，自三十五年八月頒佈蘇軍票整理辦法，九月九日起登記蘇軍票，一律開始全部兌現，九月以後新收復谷地區，乃於十月十五日另訂舖充登記辦法，其收兌工作，亦正隨軍事之推進而推進中。（二）整理僞滿券，採取但收不發，截至三十五年十二月底，暗中收回之僞滿劵巳達四·六四五·三二九·四六〇元，約佔總發行額百分之三十四點三，三十六年起尙未獲得正式統計數字，現市面僞滿劵除五十元以下者外，業已絕跡，流通劵已成爲東北唯一通用之貨幣。（三）整理「蓋印法幣」，截至三十六年一月底，已大部收回。</p>
<p>關於匯兌之開放，一面舉辦公教人員瞻家匯款，一面頒佈「工商匯款實施辦法」以利商民，流通與法幣之兌現率初爲一比十三，繼改爲一一·五與一二·五之匯價。一年以來東北物價始終較關內爲低，不能不歸功於流通劵之發行及匯兌管理得宜所致。再次則爲金融市塲之管理，嚴禁黃金交易。自三十五年七月起，政府即公吿禁止黃金及外匯買賣，一面檢查金店銀樓，一面獎勵人民吿密黑市，遂吿絕跡。此外政府如扶植工礦事業之發展，曾舉辦大量工業貸款，對資源委員會在東北創設之十九國營工礦生產單位，已由銀行透支廿億元，對中小工業之扶植，曾頒佈「商業銀行中小工業聯合貸款辦法草案」，被貸廠礦，受惠匪淺。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>共匪圖掘黃河提岸　陸總部列舉鐵證　民衆展開衛鄕救國運動</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州三日電〕陸總徐州司令部新聞處長吳一舟，頃就共匪在舊城薰口間準備掘堤事，發表談話如次，共匪劉伯誠，率部一，二，三，六，七等縱隊，竄渡黃河，進擾魯西後，因迭遭國軍嚴重打擊，及各地人民堅强反抗，一再潰敗，犧牲慘重，近爲挽救其行將全部消滅之命運，並掩蔽其潰敗之恥辱計，正積極部署掘堤，企圖湮沒南岸，惟爲推卸此種罪行責任，竟事先宣傳，諉稱國軍計劃掘堤決口，如七月廿九日共匪邯鄲廣播電台，乘劉匪在東明以西之郝寨地區準備決口時，反而宣傳係國軍五五八團所爲，其顚倒是非，欺騙人民之居心，昭然若揭。其阻礙政府修堤護河工程之進行，更不勝枚舉，如七月上句，聯絡人員於武陟及鄄城濮縣之間工作，爲北岸劉匪砲擊，不得不全部撤回開封，七月三十一日共匪邯鄲廣播電台廣播，僞晋冀魯豫解放區民主政府七月中旬聲明謂：「我方（匪自稱）已入整個軍事狀態，希望聯絡人員不要再到解放區來，否則不予保護」，並播送消息謂「政府方面之山東修防處朱口工程第三隊，完全被我壓迫退至高村及毛店附近，又該隊所存之工料，全部搶回黃河北岸」等語，凡此均爲共匪阻碍政府復堤工程之鐵證。現値大泛時期，水勢陡漲，各處河堤險象叢生，我搶修人員正日夜趕工護堤惟恐不及，而劉匪竟不以南岸千百萬人民爲念，復集結一，六，七，三個縱隊，圍攻我駐臨濮集復堤部隊，並到處襲擊搶修員工，同時巳在舊城董口之間，挖綱引河三道，準備掘堤，現魯西南曹屬各縣民棄，澈底認識共匪罪惡，已紛紛揭竿起義，展開反抗共匪衛鄕救國運動。</p>

<h3>東北面臨新危機　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>乙，工礦方面：政府對重工業之整理，以資源委員會爲中心，就中對煤電兩項之復工增產特予重視，復工大礦有阜新，撫順，西安，北票，本溪湖，烟台，營城子等，其他各地小礦雖有主管機關負責開採，因其產量甚微，僅足供當地需要，而大礦產量因設備破壞原料及電力供應不足，亦僅及僞滿時期產量之四分之一以至十分之一。計三十五年度十月份總產量爲三十六萬公噸，三十五年全年度總產量為一百六十萬噸，發電事業規模較大者，計有吉林（水電），撫順，西安，北票（火電）四處，以往發電能力爲二五百萬瓩而現有發電量僅爲過去五分之一，其他鞍山，本溪湖電廠，所發電力，多供當地礦塲需用，除煤電外，他如製鐵製鋼工業，非鐵金屬工業機器工業，電器品工業，化學工業·煤油工業·永泥工業，或已復工增　，或正亟圖規復，其工作進度尙未一日停頓。</p>
<p>政府對輕工業之整理，則以生產管理局爲中心，該局計接收工廠一千餘單位，但因原料上交通技術等條件之限制，未能全部恢復經營，截至最近復工者，只五十九廠，該局將新接收一廠分爲標賣，標租，合辦三個原則，盡力讓與民營，現正陸續處理中。</p>
<p>丙，貿易方面：三十五年八月十六日東北行轅經濟委員會公佈「商貨出入調節暫行辦法」，「鐵路整車貨運暫行辦法」，將輸出品分別列爲普通輸出，許可輸出，特許輸出三類，輸入品則未加限制。其後對許可輸出物資中五金，鋼鐵類輸出，規定須以貨易貨，以調節關內外物資之供應。此外如防止商人獲得超如利潤起見，對關內外價格相差過鉅之商品輸出時，規定應於合法利潤之外徵收「平建資金」，法良意美，惜執行機構權力不能集中，經濟檢查不能發揮效率，路局人員舞弊偸運，走私之風甚熾，致玩法者可以取巧，循規者無法生存，貿易情形遂陷入壟斷狀態，殊堪浩嘆。關於輸出入物資數量，據東北物資調節委員會公佈自三十五年六月至十二月出關總値爲一二八億餘元，進關總値爲一〇六億餘元，計入超二十二億元，出關貨物多係製成品，而近於消耗品，進關多爲食糧及原料出關貨物以紙烟，棉布，汽油等爲大宗，其價格遠超於同量進關貨物數倍以上。　此觀察。東北現階段對外貿易，殊欠合理。吾人認爲東北必需確立一全般性之經濟建設方案，促進工業生產，實行計劃貿易，前途始可樂觀。</p>
<p>記者詢以對東北未來發展之期望如何？渠以極樂觀之情緒答覆稱：東北不僅爲東北人之生命綫，抑且爲全中國人之營養庫。十四年來，淪陷敵手，雖經恣意榨取，放蕩搜刮、精華所在，悉遭刧掠、蓋以勝利以來，蘇軍先駐非法武裝部隊潛行侵入，重要物資器材，又被搬移洗刧一空，吾人至感傷心；，但以在此天賦之富源，尙可開發，已損之廠礦，尙可復工，十年生聚之後，欲恢復僞滿時代之舊觀，殆非難事。惟先決問題必須解決者，即東北必須全面接收，共匪勢力決不能任其長此發展、東北共匪存在一日。則一切經濟建州設均將無從談起。東北共匪之幕後有無外力操縱，吾人、目前未使遽加判斷，惟旅大如不能迅速接收，則難免啟外力干涉之漸。以目前東北局勢而論，實不能免除吾人之新的恐怖，而此種新的危機之潛伏，吾人實有權要求全世界愛好和平正義之人士，共同予以撲滅。東北現已從日本帝國主義者鐵蹄下重新光復，吾人自不容再有外來勢力存在，不但如此，吾人並希望對日和會能早日召開，並以瀋陽　舉行地，東北十四年來所受之經濟損　，　接受日本之全部賠償。同時在日本投降後，我政府接收前，東北所受之意外損失，不論是金融的，經濟的各部門，吾人亦希望盟國對日陪償委員會考慮及此，會商一合理並實際之補償方案。至於今後東北經濟發展之途徑，氏認爲首先應將固有之工礦事業整理規複，力謀增產自給，减少輸入增加輸出，而東北幣制，尤需與全國幣制保持統一，不宜久有九省流通劵之存在。最後氏稱：吾人以極熱烈之情緒，歡迎魏德邁將軍蒞臨東北，希望魏氏能以此行所獲得之事實資料，協助解決東北問題，而精神上之協助將尤較物質協助爲重要云。（完）</p>

<p>〔中央社台南三日電〕台南縣境西部布袋虎尾，北港，西螺，新化等地，乃台省鹽米漁主要產區，其間交通以公路爲主。西螺，北斗間，有一座未完成之遠東第一公路橋樑，長達一千九百四十一公尺，昔日人時代僅完成其橋基之一部，光復後台省長官公署有鑒該橋之重要，特聘請工程專家萬東滋氏設計，以便繼續建造，現聞台省府亦有此項計劃，頃據萬氏稱：該橋樑倘若飩以鋼質構造，全部工程費，至少需用台幣二十億元，惟若建造水泥橋，則估需台幣十三億元，預計費時三年，方可完成。按該橋樑不僅視爲遠東最長之公路橋樑，而於縮短台南縣境主要各產區距離，便利交通，供開發農業經濟言之，其價値尤爲深大。</p>

<h3>社論　高等敎育應普遍發展</h3>
<p>報載目前全國各地專科以上學校，請求改制或遷移地址者，共達六十九校之多，他們爲什麼要作遷校的要求呢？他們的要求是否合理？</p>
<p>「全國高等教育應依照地域作普遍的發展，」乃是前年十一月教育部所召集的教育復員會議所決定的。當時認爲教育「復員」，不是「復原」，全國高等教育機關應作有計劃的分布，不使在大都會裏集中而作畸形的發展。這樣決定了之後，許多專科學校，獨立學院及大學，便指定設在比較偏僻的地點，來負起發展內地文化的艱巨使命。</p>
<p>這種教育政策，在理論上是對的，全國高等教育機關決不應集中在京·滬·平·津幾個都市裏。但事實上怎樣？復員後內地各大學的情形如何？他們能不能負起高等教育作全國普遍發展的莊嚴使命？爲什麼他們要紛紛請求遷校？這是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>教育事業成功的基本條件是師資和設備。內地高等教育機關却缺乏這稞成功的基本條件，其艱苦情形，千萬倍嚴重於都市的學校。大學設備簡陋，又缺乏優良師資，自然不能滿足學生的求知慾望，於是風潮疊起，要求遝校，學校行政人員，無法處理，終於紛紛辭職，校內行政失去重心，教育部也就難於應付了。</p>
<p>許多大學教授爲什麼不願到內地去執教？歸納其理由　共有六點：第一，薪津太薄，內地無職可兼，亦不能兼營其他事業，以維持其生活；第二，交通不便，旅費高昂，且時常容易碰到意外的災難；第三，圖書儀器設備較差，添置不易，研究工具缺乏；第四，醫藥設備不齊全，生命沒有保障；第五，優良中小學較少，子女就學成問題；第六，個人與其他各界人士接觸較少，發展困難。有了這六種原因，所以目前造成京滬一帶師資過剩，內地發生師荒的現象。大學教授是自由職業，他們爲了生命的安全，經濟的解決，知識的進步，子女教育的選禪以及基本物質生活的要求（如電燈·自來水等），你沒有理由或能力强迫他們到內地去。所以教育部的部聘教授，也都集中都市。試檢閱內地各大學或學院請求遷校，無一不提出交通不便，聘請教授困難爲理由。大學若缺乏好教授與設備，便等於失去靈魂，在這種情形之下，從何談提高學生程度？從何談培養研究精神？從何談發展內地文化？更從何談學術？再加上政治經濟不安定的因素，於是內地高等教育的情形便江河日下了。</p>
<p>教育事業必須在安定中求進步，優良的教師，完善的設備，滿足學生求知的慾望，引導他們走向學術研究的途徑，以探求眞理，乃是當今急切的要務，捨此而求學校安定，學術發展，都是捨本逐末，勞而無功。</p>
<p>我國的高等教育決不能專在大都市裏謀發展，必須深入內地，我們願意擁護全國高等教育謀各地平均發展的主張，但這不是一句空話所能盡力，必須要附有切實的辦法。首要之圖，卽在如何能使內地大學能够聘到優良的教授，能够充實其設備。這些，都是教育行政當局不可諉卸的責任。內地的大學·獨立學院·專科學校之建築費，設備費，行政費等（包括教師的旅費），都應該訂有特別優待的單行法，針對上述大學教授不願到內地去服務的六點理由，使之逐漸解決。大都會裏的大學要充實，要發展，內地的大學更要充實，更要發展。教育行政的觀點，要使後者更重於前者，一改過去大都市裏的大學在經費分配上「近水樓台先得月」的作風。惟有這樣，才能使後方大學，吸收人才，充實設備；也惟有這樣，才能使全國高等教育作普遍的發展。否則，今天內地各校要求遷校的呼聲將不能望其停止，而此一問題也未必能得合理的解決。</p>
<h3>革新地方政治</h3>
<p>行政院於全國糧食會議之後，乃乘各省主席在京之便，曾舉行行政座談會四次，集各省主席與中央各部會長官於一堂，一方面由各省主席陳述地方行政的實際困難以及地方對於中央的要求；另一方面則由中央就各省主席所陳述的意見，加以檢討及指示，並提出中央對於地方的希望；使中央與地方互相瞭解，從而共同努力，以貫澈當前的國策。行政座談會昨已圓滿結束了，據本報駐京記者的報導，此次行政座談會所討論的主要問題，有下列各項：（一）在憲政準備時期，各省政治如何始能配合憲政？（二）在總動員命令頒佈之後，地方動員人力財力以及物力，如何始能與軍事配合？（三）地方治安及跌序的確保？（四）地方行政及財政機構之合理調整。</p>
<p>上述的幾個問題，在目前確實是非常嚴重的問題，這些問題如果不能獲得合理的解決，則一切革新政治的計劃，都無從談起。但是這次行政座談會，僅僅交換中央與地方的意見，並沒有作具體的決定；所以我們仍不得不向中央呼籲，密切注視地方行政的革新。本報南京二日電，監察委員于樹德等四十三人，聯名提出一種「革新政治緊急施行事項十六點」一案，聞其內容分爲政治與經濟兩大部份，對於改革地方政治，也提出幾點意見、其中最惹人注意的，莫過於：（一）實行軍民人治，地方官吏不得由軍人担任；（二）地方官吏不得兼職，厲行一個一職制；（三）劃分中央與地方的權限，廢除特殊化地方制度；（四）減併駢枝機構，改善並劃一公敎人員待遇。我烏希望政府當局，對於這一個革新政治的建議，不僅應該特別重視，而且也應該竭盡所能，務使其在最短期內切實施行。</p>
<p>軍民分治，論理在中國，不應再成爲問題的；但是在日軍投降之初，各省的行政，莫不偏重在受降，接收，以及復員方面，因比各省主席不得不由軍人担任；其後共匪據兵作亂，使若干省份仍在軍事狀態之下，爲確保常地的安寗起見，仍以軍人担任地方長官爲相宜。所以一直到現在，各省主席，大半由軍人担任；但是這種過渡辦法，當不容其長此存在；凡不再受共匪威脅的省份，就應該首先實行軍民分治的辦法，使地方政治早日走上正軌。</p>
<p>我們卽以最單純的眼光，觀察所謂「衆人之事」—政治，也就不難獲得一個結論：就是與人民日常生活最密切的，莫過於地方政治，地方政治的優劣，足以直接影響及人民對於政府的態度。今日政府當局欲言革新政治，則必須從革新地方政治下手。否則任何良計美法，終不免徒托空言，不能實現。</p>
<p>目下各省　在準備普選，這是我國國民大會通過新憲法後的第一次普選，也就是我國政治走上民主化的第一步；第一步走得好不好？足以影響及我國民主憲政的前途，所以在普選舉行之前，我們主張各省政治應先發動一個革新運動，俾能確保各省普選在憲政的常軌內順利進行！</p>

<h3>英經濟危機嚴重　政府勢將採取緊急措施　陶格拉斯將晤克萊頓提出報吿</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕權威方面相信英國之經濟危機已至最嚴重階段而不及等待馬歇爾建議下援助之獲得，故料英政府於星期三向下議院發表之聲明，將爲一九三九年宣戰以來最危急而嚴重之表示。美大使陶格拉斯定今日自倫敦飛巴黎晤美副國務卿克萊頓，討論英政府認爲美國尙未充分了解英國經濟危機急迫性之狀態。渠將吿以英國之美匯缺乏危機，在數星期內將成爲英鎊危機，而威脅英國幣制之安定。</p>
<p>據最近權威方面之估計，英國向美所借之款，至九月底即將用罄，縱有减少進口等措施，至遲於十月中句亦不免用罄。一般已認馬歇爾計劃下之援助，縱使得於明春成爲事實，對英國巳覺過遲。英政府雖尙未正式要求美國給予馬歇爾計劃實現前之過渡性援助，但悉克萊頓首在倫敦時，英政府已向其說明英國經濟需要之迫切性，然迄今一月，美國猶未有何表示，而英國向美借款已僅餘十億元。在不得已之情形下，始知照美國將不能簽訂具有禁止歧視輸入規定之多方面貿易協定。</p>

<h3>聯合國美代表　責蘇故意延宕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕美國出席聯合國軍事參謀委員會代表麥克納尼將軍頃作廣播演說，指責蘇聯躭誤聯合國軍力之成立。渠稱：「一年來對四十一條議程之討論，毫無結果，其中經我人同意者有二十五條，未經伺意者有十六條，而蘇聯對此十六條之意見與其他十一國無一相同者」</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖二日電〕原子能委員會蘇代表奧斯滂攻擊蘇聯代表稱：「彼等對於世界原子能管制之一切談判，皆加阻撓，渠等之行動，似不知原子武器乃新式及可怕性質者」。美代表又稱：原子談判，在蘇聯與其他國家間幾已完全陷於僵局。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕政府發表統計：六月份美國出口貿易總額十二億四千萬元，較五月份跌落百分之十三，即十八億元，此乃美國對外貿易初次大挫折，一部份對外貿易專家非正式視爲美國對外貿易，衰落的轉捩點。各方分析出口跌落原因爲（一）外國黃金與美元資產迅速枯竭；（二）外國减少購買，以保持其衰落中之購買力。出口跌落可能發生之影響如次：（一）商業與就業失去正常，但外國停止向美購貨競爭後，或可補救美國一部份通貨膨脹。（二）美貨進口减少後，外國通貨膨脹將加甚，經濟危機將加强政治紛擾。</p>
<h3>義總統簽署和約批准書　美義交換外交函件公布</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬二日電〕義總統尼古拉已於今日簽署批准義大利和約之案，俟蘇聯繼英法美之後正式批准該約後，和約即可生效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日鼓勵義大利設法修正對義和約，暗中担保美國給予支持。馬卿此舉與美國之政策相符，即强調義大利之反共，儘速承認其爲完全獨立國及增加其在歐洲政治上之重要任務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕美國務院二日公布國務卿馬歇爾與義外長斯福薩之間所交換之信件。馬歇爾致斯福薩之函稱：義大利政府之批准和約，可掃除法西斯所築義大利與其他各國間之最後障礙，渠又促請義政府修改條約中美國所反對之各項，然並未明言為何項。義外長斯福薩覆函稱，義大利人民甚願通過聯合國或由兩國間之條約滿足美國之希望。</p>
<h3>世界各國　共產黨日趨衰落</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>世界各國的共產黨，現在漸漸失勢了。有些國家爲了需要美元而排斥共產黨。有些國家爲了團結統一力圖復興而剔除共產黨。</p>
<p>不過這趨勢也許是暫時的。多數希望獲得美元的政府至今還沒有到手。共產黨也許要捲土重來。有幾個國家的共產黨勢力相當强大，要是沒有他們的支持，政府是不能站穩的。</p>
<p>美國國務院刻正從事一種調查，想知道美國政策對於全世界的共黨而非共黨之間的鬥爭究竟有什麼影響。調查的結果如下：</p>
<p>自從杜魯門總統於三月十二日宣佈對希土貸款計劃，藉以加强其反抗共產主義及穌聯壓力的實力以後，各國共產黨勢力的衰落，較前加甚。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於各國共產黨勢力的衰退，異常關切。莫斯科常台指責美國支持反動派，「鼓勵法西斯主義」。可是多數國家的自由主義者却因美國此舉而佔了便宜，倒霉的是共產黨。</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>法國的共產黨現在已經脫離政府，因爲他們口頭上雖擁護內閣的工資凍結政策，實際上却企圖支持罷工者爭取工資，因此而被擇出了內閣。</p>
<p>法國共產黨在工會方面也漸漸失勢。本年春間，他們希望靠了全國工人的選舉，把握社會安全制度的管理權，但是開票的結果，卒因票數不足而告失敗。現在社會黨和其他非共產黨正在向法國最大工人組織全國總工會的領袖們挑戰。</p>
<p>對於法國共產黨反對最力的一個人，便是戰時自由法國首領戴高樂將軍。戴氏在美國地中海政策的鼓勵下，建立了一個反共運動組織，會員號稱一百萬人。他的努力加速了共產黨的離異行動。</p>
<p>法國的非共產黨政府刻正向美乞援，法國須在一九四八年八月以前輸入小麥二十億噸，並且需要十億美元以供建設之用。法國共產黨領袖杜克洛現正憑藉該黨在法國勞工方面的勢力，使法國對覓取美元的見解，不致與共產黨離異過遠。</p>
<p>法國共產黨爲了討好法國民衆，竭力制止罷工，增加生產。但是民間還不時發生罷工。要是共產黨不加制止而煽動罷工，法國的經濟也許就要崩潰的。</p>
<p>北歐</p>
<p>在北歐方面，蘇聯北方的隣國現正排除共產黨。芬蘭工人的自由選舉已經從共產黨手裏奪取了全國工會委員會的控制權。結果，芬蘭和蘇聯的關係變得緊張起來了。自從一九四六年二月以來，芬蘭所獲得的美國借款和信用貸款，總計在一億美元以上。此外，他們還需要更多的美元，以充一九四八年輸入計劃的資金。但是芬蘭還不敢公然反抗蘇聯。</p>
<p>本年四月間丹麥舉行大選時，共產黨得票僅七萬一千九百票，較之一九四五年全國普選時得票二十五萬五千五百三十六票，不可以道里計了。丹麥現在向復興之途邁進，擬向世界銀行借款五千萬美元，但並未向美國直接吿貸。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>德國西部最近舉行選舉，共產黨的票數突吿慘落。只有在英國佔區北萊茵地西法利亞一區中，共產黨獲得了百分之十四的票數。在其他各區祗獲全部票數的百分之五到百分之八。</p>
<p>聖地</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦的阿刺伯共產黨在一年中黨員增加了一倍，但是最近蘇聯爲了批准阿刺伯人所反對的巴勒斯坦分治計劃，漸漸失去了威信。共產黨工會的二萬工人中，大多數逐漸脫離該會。猶太共產黨在猶太議會中一百七十一席中僅佔三席，勢力依然很是薄弱。</p>
<p>美洲</p>
<p>美洲的反共情緒日益膨脹。一九四六年得共產黨擁護而獲選的智利總統維合拉，爲了想得到美國的經濟援助，在其內閣中排除了三位共產黨部長。</p>
<p>巴西共產黨在上屆選舉中獲得五十萬票，最近被選舉法庭下令置諸法律保護之外，指摘其有意推翻民主政府。巴西經濟與美國息息相關，美國最近的對蘇聯和對共黨政策影響了巴西的政治趨勢。</p>
<p>日本</p>
<p>在日本，本年四月間舉行的全國普選，幾使共產黨的票數减少到一九四六年的半數。在議會下院四六六席中，共產黨只佔了四席，上院中竟連一席都沒有。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在另一方面，共產黨得勢的國家比較的少。</p>
<p>義國</p>
<p>義大利的共產黨實力頗强，自行設置醫院，學校和秘密警察，在失業與饑饉普遍的狀態下，共產黨以「窮人政府」號召，吸收了許多信徒。</p>
<p>美國已將値價十億元以上的救濟品運入義大利，現在進出口銀行又在考慮義大利的一億元貸款請求。可是已經或答應給予義大利的美元，對於義大利未來的影響仍極微細。結果共產黨在選舉中所得的票數較前增加，並且控制了大多數的工業區。</p>
<p>東歐</p>
<p>在蘇聯佔領區範圍，以內的柏林，共產黨已經靠了工會選舉控制五十萬工人。在東歐，共黨支配下的南斯拉夫和保加利亞，受到很少反對。匈牙利的非共黨政黨，因受共產黨警察的壓力，漸漸軟弱下來。波蘭雖受共產黨的嵌制，現正向美國吿貸美元。</p>
<p>因有上述種種原因，共產黨與非共產黨之間的僵局日益加深。兩者之間的新均勢或許就是目前趨勢的結果。非共產黨現時所得到的優勢，也許不能永遠保持，但是共產黨欲恢復其自美國在地中海樹立新政策以來所失去的選舉票數和威信，是極少希望的。（譯自「世界報吿」週刋）</p>
<h3>美佔區德工廠私藏戰具　售予蘇佔領當局　蘇方曾出函證明需要此等儀器</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢堡二日電〕柏林阿斯肯那廠（即美軍當局於昨日發現私藏大宗非法戰具之處）之人員稱：該廠所製配備於運至蘇軍區泰爾托夫之分廠後，又轉售予蘇佔領軍常局。據英軍區之德國新聞社稱：阿斯肯那之執行及生產理事會稱，瞭望測察儀器四十具運至泰爾托夫分廠轉售於蘇佔領當局後，蘇代表曾出函證明需要此　儀器，此　儀器適合各種測量及觀察工作，可供軍用亦可供民用。此　儀器製造需數月之久，並非新製，乃集合已存零件而成。戰爭結束以來，售出不多。阿斯肯那廠當局又稱：該廠柏林米林道夫區分廠發見之潛艇潛望鏡，係在廢鐵堆中發見，此等廢金屬一部份係美軍協助收集，潛望鏡之支桿均已切去，以供製造他物之用。阿斯肯那廠已不復有製造新潛望鏡之機械。又據美軍區德國新聞社稱，阿斯肯那廠供給蘇常局之儀器係供測量鐵路之用，其先已經美人協助施以部份檢查，至於此等儀器如移作他用，則非該廠所能負責云。又悉生產委員會將於星期一宣布關於該廠執行首腦六名被捕及美當局調查該事之聲明。</p>

<h3>浦西綁案勒索萬萬　直搗匪穴救出三票　獲犯供出內幕情節複雜　匪魁準備得款後擴充新四軍隊伍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿一日深夜浦西題橋鄕發生離奇綁案一起，被綁者計男女四名，事後匪徒與各被綁家屬秘密談判結果，最後以白米三百六十石「成交」，作爲取贖肉票之代價，同時匪徒爲便利事主家屬繳付起見，允以每石三十五萬元折算，共計法幣一億二千六百萬元，並經約定於卅日午後在南匯縣東門外黃家路車站旁之南貨店內人款兩交，結果爲淞滬警備部第五稽查大隊，偵查破獲。緣題橋鄕第六保保長吳才福，居民徐金濤之妻周氏及商民朱才林及其妻陳氏等四人，於廿一日深夜同時被綁，當時各家屬雖諱莫如深，而淞滬警備司令部第五稽查大隊，巳風聞消息，正進行偵查之時，忽聞朱才林之妻，已於中途釋歸，匪幷派人携有朱才林之親筆信，秘密接洽贖票中。該大隊加緊偵查，得悉被綁之朱才林，係敵僞時期之該鄕鄕長，而徐周氏係徐金濤之棄婦，認爲此案似另具有錯綜複雜之情節，乃根據原有綫索作深入偵查，幷設法接近被綁者之親屬，而監視其動態。惟各被綁人之家屬，懾於匪勢，恐遭撕票，不敢稍露風聲，僅暗中進行贖票工作，因此偵查工作，頗感無從着手。該大隊長李人璋，乃決定採取側面偵察，在被綁人朱才林之房弟身上，得到確實綫索，幷證明朱妻脫險逃回及七月廿三日，由脚伕送到一信，約定地點與匪接洽各節，均屬事實。朱弟並謂匪首即係被害人徐周氏之夫徐金濤，朱弟又稱：曾如期派人赴約，匪初討價須以白米七百石取贖，因此數字過鉅，無力負擔，未遽應允，經徐金濤等引路，行約半里，復乘小船至一小村落，與其兄朱才林（肉票）見面，親自談判結果允以白米三百二十石贖票，惟匪又索贈送快慢機一打，謂其「大隊」新近成立，槍枝不够，經以無法購買爲辭，後商決加米四十石，連前三百六十石，以三五作價，折合一億二千六百萬元取贖，幷約於卅日下午在南匯縣東門外黃家路車站旁邊之南貨店內交款，案情至此，偵查工作已至相當成熟。李大隊長乃將前後經過轉報陶處長一珊，陶處長即令其請示張代副處長，計劃破案。經縝密研究，決定由第五大隊會同第八大隊（浦東）乘其交款之時，予以破獲。至七月三十日，派行動股長蔡行可率領幹員陶祖杰·顧玉峯等，會同第八稽查大隊化裝按址秘密偵伺。蔡等於黎明前到達目的地，蔡並先行偵察地形，但守候終日，毫無動靜，蔡等本擬即行包圍實施威力搜索，第以該處環境複雜，且無確實內綫，萬一搜索無着，反而打草驚蛇，全功盡廢。乃潛伏附近，偵騎四出，多方打聽直至卅一日晨始行返隊，至本月一日　　綜合各方所得，始悉卅日交款，因被害人家屬恐被撕票，係秘密差人送去，對該隊未稍露痕跡，故失去一良好機會。並悉：其款係分期交付，尙有第二批約於一日下午三四時在本市金神父路六十三衖內由匪方派人領取，當派蔡股長仍率陶祖杰·顧玉峯及義務員湯和昌·吳鐵民·柴有勤·王德世等，前往秘密偵伺。迨至五時，果見有行跡可疑之人兩名，於該衖內　相呼應，察情觀色，審係匪徒無疑，乃發動暗號，同時動手，該離奇綁案之主犯徐金濤，及其黨羽徐阿初，遂均落網。帶隊硏訊後，據供：藏票地點係浦東南匯縣屬董家路東約六里銅橋鍾家祠堂，遂於當晚九時由大隊長李人璋，親自率領蔡行可等大批幹員，押同徐匪阿初，再度前往，會同第八大隊緝拿餘黨，營救肉票。當由第八大隊加派吳保和等三員，於子夜十二時，由東昌路出發至周浦，會同當地自衛隊共同行動，到達銅橋附近，已是二日拂曉前二時半，經野猫洞（村名），道若羊腸，僅能容足。李等在月光下摸索前進，又行百步，忽見一片汪洋，橫斷去路，乃設法覓得渡船，捨陸登舟，直撲鍾家祠堂，實施包困。孰料匪徒均已他徙，詰詢守祠老者，答以昨日（按係卅一日）尙在，今日不知去向。在此情形之下，已至絕望，復提徐阿初拷詢，徐知不能復隱，乃謂可能隱匿附近。李大隊長復督率所屬四下搜索，並於扼要孔道，層布崗哨及至馬家宅一　舍前，瞥見二人，似司守望，欲圖鼠竄，李大隊長急喝令所部，勇往直前，當由關祖杰一馬當先，首將把風匪徒踢倒，其所携快慢機及手榴彈，均未及放發，隨後全體趕到，當捕獲該把風匪徒吳龍才及著匪馬福樓之妾李大妹，主犯徐金濤之妾顧婉韻等三名，繳獲駁壳槍一枝，子彈六發，手榴彈一枚，贓款數百萬元，當救出肉票朱才林及徐周氏二人，尙有肉票吳才福一名，及著匪馬福樓等則被脫逃。</p>
<p>至此，乃進行似訊，由稽查處代副處長張揚明，率同大隊長李人璋，大隊附姜宗渭等，漏夜審訊。該主犯徐金滿，供出四十七歲，南匯人，入贅周家爲婿，隨妻住題橋鄕，曾經營棉花，米糧，水巢等商業，現開肉舖。於三十一年因病認識看護顧婉韻，即納爲小星，暗築香巢於南市株下路六十八號，馬匪福樓之妾李大妹，亦寄居其家，因在周家作贅婿時，曾三次被搶，謂均與朱才林有關，故此次綁朱報復，又因在周家有田廿畝，自棄髮妻周氏後，該保保長吳才福即阻止其自行收租，因此挾恨綁吳，並擬將此廿畝田强售與朱吳二人，故綁髮妻到塲進行買賣。又供出計劃綁票情形，係於七月初旬與馬匪數度商量，由馬糾集匪衆雄備槍枝，至七月廿三日決定同時綁架朱周吳等三人，並由徐匪自行偵探朱等是否在家，至次日（廿一）徐匪偵查妥當後，即通知馬匪，馬匪即率徒衆沈金濤，王阿三，吳龍才（又名阿二，江北人）范金生，王茂生等，由南匯出發，搭車到天福庵車站，徐匪金濤於下午五時到站會齊，在附近茶樓商議，至晚九時許出發。先到朱才林家，由徐金濤謙開大門，七人擁入，即拿出手槍，將朱夫婦綁架，順路到周·吳二家依法綁架周氏及吳才福，至半途因朱妻要求，始將其放回，然後將預備更換之衣服，與肉票更換，以避免追趕。在距周浦約八里地之河內，預光以七萬元一艘之價，備好帆船兩艘，由匪妾顧婉韻·李大妹等守候，肉票到河邊時，立即上船，逕開南匯，至黃家路下馬渡登陸，時已為二十二日上午八時許矣。然後即逐日更換地址，並准肉票自由，有時還與匪衆一道打牌，同時進行贖票首先索價七百石米，隨後减至三百六十石，折價一萬二千六百萬，復允以六百萬給徐周氏匪凈得一萬二千萬，已於七月卅日送到三千萬，內支票二百萬退回，又少二十萬，實已收到票價現款二千七百八十萬，除馬匪取去一千六百萬，開支五百餘萬外，餘存之款，已被全數起獲，並供馬匪係與新四軍張大鵬有關，自稱大隊長，準備票價得到後，即擴充「隊伍」。又供出案中案，因張代副處長已訊明該匪等旣係新四軍，當非做此一案，因此訊明本案，再追訊其餘，反復誘脅，卒供出在鍾家祠堂時，會於黑夜用繩索絞斃一人，看守鍾家祠堂，係一倪姓，倪有二姪，一名倪紀樓，一名倪阿二，均係無賴，且弟兄因爭住房展成仇，倪阿二曾出言必殺其兄該倪紀樓住上海，業縫工，曾與馬匪福樓，沈匪金濤等，在僞軍同事，且倪馬沈等　　均係縫工，是時倪紀樓適回南匯，無意中遇馬沈等，將肉票寄存其家（即鍾祠）乃即入夥，又適遇倪阿二看到，馬等恐其走風，倪則乘機去仇，故由沈金濤，王阿三，黃茂生等三人，將該倪阿二誘至，用繩索勒斃，拋屍於附近之湖塘下。吳匪龍才供稱：二十二歲，上海人，住閔行東浦吳家宅，所供犯案經過各情與徐匪供詞無異，該兩匪妾亦均直認前情。現警備部正查緝漏網匪徒中。</p>

<h3>余盛孝被殺案　偵查漸趨明朗　多人指認却利即為獲案英人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於西人槍殺余盛孝一案，昨日已獲得重要之發展，自英人却利阿却因涉嫌被捕在押後，昨日已由死者之妻前往指認，確認却利阿却者即爲彼所熟悉之却利。</p>
<p>惟却利阿却對槍殺一點，雖經警局方面日夜偵詢，但仍否認如故。現悉全案正分兩方面進行俱查，一方面除偵詢却利本人外，一方面則正傳詢各有關證人中。</p>
<p>據吳家巷一鄕人證明：渠曾首光發現余盛孝倒臥於路旁血泊中。同時又據另一鄉人證明：渠於出事地點附近，確曾目睹一黑色轎車飛奔於滬靑公路上，開車者爲一身體健碩，嘴蓄小髭，身穿白色襯衫之西人，車廂中則另有一西人，似正側身在座位上作揩抹之狀。當時因不知已生事變，故對車子號碼未加注意。</p>
<p>警局昨日又在余盛孝之同業方面偵詢一切，據彼等所吿：亦確認被捕之却利阿却即爲彼等所熟悉之却利。且更指出是日下午三時以前，却利曾與余盛孝茶叙於南京路外灘匯中飯店內，談判交易。至三時許，余盛孝步行至四川路寗波路飛達洋服店時，嘗與店中人談及此事，謂却利行將駕車來此。但至四時許，忽逢大雨，迨店中人憶及余盛孝時，尋之則已失踪，當時臆測或在大雨之際，却利駕車至附近即載余盛孝而去也。</p>
<h3>身穿軍服敲詐被捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有自稱警備部工作人員之靑年張志祥，因向住居安遠路五〇一號開設抄貨店之店生海寳山敲詐法幣五千萬元，經人向警備部吿發，於昨日下午一時正當雙方交款時在南京路匯中飯店內被捕。時張身穿軍官制服，佩帶槍械。據悉張係於上月廿七日晚偕另一軍人及穿西服者二人至上述地址指海有販毒嫌疑，擬加拘捕，旋經人說項，以五千萬元了事。當塲除付三千萬現鈔外，另款約於昨日午後在匯中飯店內付淸。常逮捕時張方自海手中接過今日期之金源錢莊支票二千萬元，尙未察閱，詎已爲身後之警備部人員出槍制止矣。</p>
<h3>黑風扇之謎　各機關請配未得　市塲上却已出現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據「行總」官方發表稱外傳該署於五月丁三日至七月五日間出售剩餘電風扇七千五百只，中有一千只由各進出口行優先購去，轉輾流入黑市一事，顯有誤會。據云，此項電扇均係一一〇伏特，專供航船使用者，不合一般需要，故曾於五月廿三日售予各進出口行五百只，繼又公開售出一千只，各界聞訊，爭往申請配購、迄七月五日止，共已售出七千五百只。此時「聯總」忽通知「行總」，謂該項電扇存貨無多，餘數係備「聯總」及「行總」本身之用，「行總」當即遵照停止配售，此中措置方面或有失當，致有誤傳云云。按「行總」配售電扇價格爲每只四十萬元，但現下各商店攤販零售似則達八十萬至一百二十萬元云。</p>
<p>又據華東社訊：行總財務廳，上月出售美式牆掛式十二吋小風扇，三四日即吿截止，各機關等紛往請購，謂已售罄，均遭拒絕，詎市上黑市竟有此種風扇發售，每只價售六十萬或八十萬不等。按行總倉庫，共有此種風扇二萬餘隻，迄前日止，庫內尙存有三千餘只，故各方對行總財務廳，頗表不滿云。</p>
<h3>「飛盤」下降　斷為氣候測量器　高橋田野拾得一枚上下兩球各如西瓜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高橋前日下午盛傳獲得「飛盤」一隻，一時轟動全鎭，無不引爲奇談。事後經高橋警察分局携帶返局，硏究結果，所謂「飛盛」也者，乃一「高空測量器」之類。</p>
<p>當前日下午四時許，有高橋第一保黃家灣居民於天空瞥見發射白光體之圓盤一隻，隨風飄盪，跌落農田。經檢視之下，所謂「飛盤」之形狀，實爲上下兩球組織而成，一球作黑褐色，一球作銀白色，體積大小如西瓜，質係橡膠製成。兩球之間，復有一小型五寸見方之白鐵箱，內裝無綫電機，頂端繫有小型降落傘。該「飛盤」於飛翔天空時，其下端銀色白球，受陽光照射，發出强烈眩目之白光。其上並印有「USA」字樣。事後據該區德士古公司美籍技師稱：此所謂「飛盤」之物，實爲測量高空氣候之測量器。彼曾在美國氣象儀器製造工廠內任職三年，故深悉此種儀器，決非全世界所傳說之「飛盤」也。</p>
<h3>華成綢綾染廠主人　普陀禮佛突遇綁票　匪船中歷十晝夜贖回來滬　僧侶香伙四名涉嫌受偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前盛傳有本市鉅商在普陀被綁勒贖巨案，而風傳綁匪係本市一著名寺院某方丈，經記者多方探詢，始悉此一綁案內容曲折離奇，茲誌詳情於後：</p>
<p>緣有居住本市成都路七六二弄九號之陳錦良者，紹興人，年已花甲，在該處開設華成綢綾染廠有年，平素篤信佛教，因與成都路太平寺前任住持僧明教交誼甚厚，明教已退居多年，與其師眞達（八十歲），徒性空（現任住持，對陳均過從甚密。六月卅日陳因欲往普陀做水陸道塲，追薦亡親，乃與眞達性空相約同乘「海深」輸離滬，蓋太平寺係普陀三聖堂之下院，陳之去普陀即因徇性空之邀，故該寺在行前特臨時通知三聖堂派專在滬普間接送香客之香伙名「筱香」者來滬伴隨彼等同行。</p>
<p>藉作響導七月一日，陳等一行安抵普陀三聖堂，由四日起至十一日止做道塲一週，陳之妻女亦由筱香赴滬搭次班輪接來普陀，迨功德圓滿後，陳即率妻女遍赴各廟拈香拜佛，十三日擬候船返滬，詎料禍生肘腋，當夜即生變故。是夜一時，月黑風高，海濤澎湃，三聖堂前突出現匪徒十數人，各携新式武器，一聲呼嘯翻牆入內，直趨陳之臥室，戟指詢陳何人？陳平時固不喜修飾，此時事出倉卒，短衣兩襲，更不類豪客，乃僞稱身染宿疾，此行係渡海求醫，冀獲仙方療病，盜衆稍一沉吟，即擬返顧他去，是時房門外忽有人於闇黑中高聲揚言陳即係滬上富戶，再不下手何待？匪徒驟聆此語，未加考慮，即羣擁陳等下山，登盜等停舶山麓之小船上。陳長跪不起請釋妻女，匪衆昂然不顧，納陳等於底層艙中，因無法透氣，悶塞欲絕，復請匪等稍啟艙蓋，一匪乃以指於艙頂挖一小洞，陳盡力外窺，但見四顧蒼茫中，人影憧憧，箱籠累累，蓋均係適間被一併擄掠登船之行囊也。</p>
<p>迨天色旣明，細雨紛飛，船乃停靠於一不知名之砂灘旁，匪等並將陳等帶入深山。翌日傍晚，又逼令登船，陳等在艙底但聞風水擊拍之聲，不知何往，直至第三日始在一怪石嵯峨之亂山叢中開始談判。談判之初，匪等稱陳為橡隊廠陳老闆，陳力自否認。匪索價條子四十根，陳祗應允小條三塊，最後匪貶價至現鈔四億八千萬，陳亦增至兩億，並謂如不能協議，甘願就戮海上，匪見情勢已無可再逼，乃吿首肯。</p>
<p>談判旣成，匪乃遣人赴三聖堂與住持性德（太平寺性空之師弟兄）接洽，稱如性德能負陳方全責，當由渠等及三聖堂各派一人來滬取款。性德因不諳上海情形，當表示拒絕，性空則激於義憤，且自念陳之來普陀係由渠相邀，友情爲重，乃自吿奮勇，願代一行，匪等復吿以抵滬後對付款及保護匪黨須負全責，如有差失，陳等性命難保，且三聖堂亦將夷為平地相約妥當，十九日性空遂伴同一匪來滬，通知陳之家屬，凑足現鈔一億，大條三根，交付後二十一日匪首即已如數收到。同時陳自十四日被綁後，每日仍由匪衆押同於夜間乘船移動，歷經各山，直至二十三日始命性德來匪窟出具保單將陳等釋出。其時浙省軍事當局因普陀海面不靖，正擬發動淸勦綏靖，匪等見形勢急迫故即候民船經靠岸，驅陳等下船，駛定海沈家門，換船至寗波，與在鄞候晤之家屬會同來滬。二十五日三聖堂以長途電話通知華成染廠，謂陳等已乘招商局輪返滬。事前新成警分局早於案發後，即派幹員偵守與該染廠有關之電話，至此乃率大批員警在招商局碼頭伏候，迨船傍岸，遂將陳等截留、復於同時抵岸之另一船中逮獲性空，筱香，性顯（亦係三聖堂之僧）及另一由三聖堂解職返滬之香伙周生泉等四名，一併帶局偵訊。</p>
<p>據悉於此案發生後數日，普陀廣福庵又有上海三施主在水陸道塲中突遭綁架之訊，是則大好佛境，殆將成修羅地獄矣。</p>

<h3>郵政局長李進祿播講　郵政服務的基本觀點　為公衆服血管不在向公衆謀利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座中國文化電台，舉辦第十八次星期日特別廣播，請上海郵政管理局局長李進祿播講：「郵政服務的基本觀點」，茲紀錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>郵政制度在我國發軔最早，根據史書所載，遠在周朝初年，就有雛形的驛站，漢唐兩代，郵亭驛站，遍及官道，這個制度最爲發達。但創辦新式郵政，到現在還不過五十年的歷史，起初由海關兼管，到宣統三年，才成立郵政總局，獨力經營。</p>
<p>漢朝的大儒董仲舒說過：「正其誼不謀其利，明其道不計其功」，我現在想「斷章取義」，把這句話應用到郵政事業上來。「正其誼不謀其利」，可以說是公營事業如郵政者固有的特點，「明其道不計其功」，可以說是郵政人員應具的德性。</p>
<p>正其誼不謀其利</p>
<p>為什麼「正其誼不謀其利」是公營事業固有的特點呢？我們知道，在各種公營事業中，郵政和公衆最爲接近，從大都市到窮鄕僻壤，從達官貴人到販夫走卒，他們大家都有社會關係，大家都需要通訊。郵政這個機構就是爲便利公衆而設的，因此，郵政應該是人民的郵政，是每一個使用郵政的人自己的郵政，這個機構的目的在於爲公衆服務，不在於向公衆謀利。假使業務上有盈餘，就把盈餘來推進工作，改良設施，換一句話說，取之於民，就應該用之於民，世界上先進國家，採取郵政經濟獨立制度，也是這個意思。我們中國却不能够這樣。由於交通阻礙，社會不安定，各項開支浩大，收入銳减，到今年五月爲止，全國郵政經濟虧損已達二，〇六九·四億，加郵不足，我們不能不仰賴於政府的貼補。然而我們並不是領了貼補來苟延殘喘，却積極的用之於改進設施，推動業務，一句話，就是用在爲公衆謀福利的事業上。祗要這件事應該做，我們就做，「正其誼而不謀其利」。我們不但是不謀其利，而且還大大的賠了本，因爲我們認定郵政事業是服務公衆的，應該以公衆的利益爲前提。</p>
<p>明其道不計其功</p>
<p>為什麼「明其道不計其功」，又是郵政人員應具的德性呢？這種道理很簡單。郵政旣然是一個服務機構，郵政人員也就必須以服務爲職志。郵政人員進局的時候，必須經過嚴格的考試，才能敍用入局，這是對於他們能否勝任的最初的考騐。進局以後，由於獎懲考核等等制度的嚴格，他們永遠是在一面工作一面學習之下進步着的。郵政人員有一個共通的精神，這就是「郵視如家」，在目前，入局八年十年的都算是資淺人員，如本人服務垂四十年的，比比皆是。我們旣然視郵政爲終身職業，當然得愛護郵政，硏究郵政，明白郵政對於公衆所負的使命。近一年來，郵政在萬分困難的情形下，埋頭苦幹，多少也受有這種精神的啟發。我們願意接受一切批評，感謝各方面過去的合作。俗語說：「任重道遠」，路正長，讓我們摸索的黑夜也正長。茫茫來茲，更希望公衆繼續給我們以指示和支持，使這個爲民衆的事業，能够得到更遠更大的發展。</p>

<h3>霸王振翼怒吼　記者結隊飛翔　杭州灣上空片刻逍遙遊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司，爲擴充　　外航綫，近特新添DC-4式「空中霸王」（Skymaster）巨型機六架。該公司爲向外界介紹該項新機之性能及設備，於昨日下午，公開招待本市新聞界試飛。慕「覇王」之名而前往參加試飛者，數近百人，憶三倍於該公司所邀請之人數，可見盛况之一般。當分二批起飛，目的地爲杭州灣上空來回，每次來回實際耗於飛行之時間，不過四十分鐘，惟起飛及降落時，因機身龐大，耗時達廿分鐘以上。</p>
<p>「空中覇王」，顧名思義，發動力之强大。機身全部作銀白色，有巨型引擎四具，每　有三葉式螺旋槳一枚。</p>
<p>沒有十三號座位</p>
<p>機身較普通整引擎客機，約大二倍，機內設有座位四十四隻，每座均編有號碼，惟十三號一座，想以不吉祥之數關係，獨付關如，而以四十五號爲末座。座墊及座背，均舖以精緻之橡皮海綿，較一般彈簧沙發，更富彈性。靠手處裝有機鈕，稍一撥動，座背即能隨心所欲，引伸至一定之斜度。端坐其間，軟柔舒適，益以機大，飛行平穩，初不覺已凌空翱翔於六千呎之上。飛機駕駛室，設在飛機首部。正　機師各一，並排而坐，駕駛時談笑自若。另附無綫電員一人，與地面維持經常電訊聯繫。聞駕駛時如四引擎中有一二引擎發生陣碍，其他引擎，仍繼續發動，直至維持至平安着陸爲止。</p>
<p>空中小姐作伴遊</p>
<p>此外每機尙隨帶「空中小姐」二人。昨日隨行者，一名藍蕙蘭，一名何淑珍，均粵籍。兩小姐體態輕盈婀娜，精諳滬粵方方外，兼擅流利英語。長途旅客，有此「空中小姐」悉心照料，旅途勞頓，殆將消失於無形。</p>
<p>霸王被在滬空盤旋僅十分鐘，此國際一大都市之形形色色，巳盡收眼底。極目四眺，但見紅瓦鱗鱗，百老匯大廈，國際飯店等大廈，類同積木玩具。浦江曲折如帶，風帆點點，軍艦畫如模型。</p>
<p>極目田野綠無垠</p>
<p>旣出市區，但見阡陌縱橫，田野碧綠無垠。越十分鐘，已臨杭州灣上空，漣漪一片，中僅靑葱小島三塊，　峙其間。遠處有薄霧籠罩，水天不分。無何。機身稍側，飛機已折入歸程。再越廿分鐘，機身已達日影西斜中，徐徐降落於龍華機塲新建寬闊之水泥跑道上。終其行，同機者未聞有感不適者，更未發現嘔吐情事，僅此似已足表示「空中霸王」性能之獨特歟。</p>

<h3>靑年軍的大家庭　嘉興夏令營在舉辦中</h3>
<p>〔嘉興訊〕政府當局爲了培養建國新人，去年曾分發了四千二百名從軍靑年，到全國各大學去讀書。今年夏天，國防部預備幹部局分別在北平嘉興兩地舉辦夏令營，通知各大學從軍靑年參加，利川各生暑期的餘閒，來重溫昔日歡聚的舊夢，共度康樂的夏日生活。夏令營的舉辦時間，自七月二十日起，至九月五日止，爲期六週。</p>
<p>嘉興夏令營是國防部預備幹部局局長蔣經國親自主持的，報到學員已達一三三五人，其中女生佔十三名。他們有的來自蘭州，瀋陽，長春，有的來自台灣，粵南。昆明，成都，重慶，亦皆有人趕來參加。長江流域，自然是人數最多。學員是國內各大學專科以上學校的學生，據記者統計：共達八十九單位，中以西北大學同學最多，共達九十四人，現該校尙有學生在途，日內即可抵達嘉興</p>
<p>西大營，往日是靑年軍嘉興靑中的所在地，現在是充滿了靑年伙伴們的聲浪。淸晨六時，在千餘雙眼睛注視之下，鮮豔的國旗，慢慢昇上旗桿頂端，一天緊張的生活，隨即開始，要一直到晚上十時半熄燈前爲止。營內有高的水塔，整齊的營房，修潔的教室和廣大的操塲，營內遍栽樹木，柳蔭夾道，走入營門沒有幾步，便可以看見一塊木牌，豎立在路側，上面白底紅字，寫着「我們利用暑假，鍛鍊身體，補習功課，加强團結，服務社會」的字句。這是幹部局舉辦夏令營的目的，也是全體學員生活的準則。</p>
<p>來營授課或即將來營的講師，有竺可楨，劉成，董洗凡的現代科學，左潞生的現代政洽思潮，李壽雍的中國現勢，何浩着的中國經濟，張耀翔的靑年心理，謝循初的社會心理，徐培根的國防雞設，阮毅成的憲法硏究，屠鎭川的體育槪論，胡昌其的美國人生活，陳立夫的總理遺教，鄧文儀的領袖言行，鄭彥棻的中國政治，徐佛觀的中國革命與黨派問題，貫亦斌的預備幹部制度，蔣經國則主講靑年問題。（鮑必驥，八，一）</p>

<h3>京市參議會　擊退馬桶捐</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕此次京市參議會開會時，馬桶捐提案最爲引人注目。提起「馬桶」，在南京已成爲一專有名詞。馬桶而有捐，尤爲世所罕有。無怪乎參議員提出，實不失爲一幕壓軸戲。問題的提出爲趙信臣，向大會提請否認糞便管理處硬性徵收馬桶捐每只五千元，並有劉守英等十二人附署，但提會討論後，各參議員紛紛發表意見，辯論至爲激烈，一二參議員且拍案怒吼，會塲秩序至爲混亂。陳議長幾至束手無策。趙信臣，劉守英，夏時，吳鳳鳴，張文伯等，則堅決主張立即停收，且認馬桶捐之徵收，未經參會審議，實爲違法，巳徵者應速退還，如市府已徵淸潔捐，殊覺苛雜。有人說糞便管理處係包商制，乃「糞大王」所包辦，他們旣可吃糞便，用糞便，收糞便，而衛生局所管何事？何不收回自辦？但持相反論調之吳延祺，顧復初等，則謂此項收費，並非「捐」性質，係代刷馬桶費，較諸佣人代刷爲廉，應予追認，可責成糞便管理處試辦三月，洗刷「臭南京」之恥辱。但反對派立即加以反駁，藉口代刷馬桶，但試問何家馬桶爲彼等所刷，且各戶自有娘姨，刷凈馬桶，即無娘姨者，亦由老婆子親刷，何必由彼代勞？且依南京慣例，某戶糞便，由菜園收取，至秋季仍送醃菜酬謝，今糞便旣被取去，尙圖再收費，於理不合。吳鳳鳴亦起立大聲呼喊：「馬桶捐奉何人命令徵收？何人委托洗刷？」原提案人趙信臣並狂喊：「參議員於競選請人投票時，均以代人民說話作宣傳，今竟代包商講話，良心何在？」後由張文伯建議：（一）應請市府就處理糞便問題另定適當辦法，送會審議。（二）上項辦法未擬定前，由市府令飭即日停收「馬桶捐」，已徵者全部退還。（三）糞便管理處徵收馬桶捐，如有詐欺嫌疑時，應請市府查明送法院辦理。結果以多數表決通過。此一「民權初步」之鬧劇，乃暫告結束。（特約記者丁匡華）</p>

<h3>四川三害：烟·匪·袍哥</h3>
<p>— 本報記者周學端</p>
<p>成都七月廿八日航訊</p>
<p>今年是四川烟毒總禁絕的年頭，上期禁政工作，應於上月屆滿，但今年四川的烟毒情形如何呢？在省參議會開幕之日，鄧錫侯主席激昂致詞，決心誓除四川三害——烟，匪，袍哥。來自各地的參議員，憤慨報吿烟毒情形，令人可悲可歎，可憤可恨。陳讓卿參議員統計：目前全川有十四個中毒區每區平均一月烟毒消耗五十二億元，全川一年消耗共八千七百卅六億元，這是如何可驚的數字！歐陽杰說：川東一帶，流毒至廣，渝萬公路及嘉陵江各水陸碼頭，均成烟毒集散地。靳曉耕說：政府禁烟，輯私人員專用假烟掉換眞烟繳公，查禁人員不特目擊轎伕吸烟而不敢檢舉，且不敢申明是查禁人員，否則無人抬轎。婁元亮問，萬源宣漢保安隊就販烟土，省府知道也未？吳階平問：旺蒼縣長與保安司令合作販烟，省府何以不問？彭王屛更大聲急呼，請鄧主席商請西康劉主席，請西康少種一點烟，這些痛切的陳詞，是代表四川五千萬人民的公意，賢明的省政當局，決不否認烟毒目前在四川的嚴種性，也剴切申明要「治亂世，用重典，」願「借人頭，肅烟患」。今天四川禁烟癮結在「坐而說，不如起而行」。我們相信省政當局禁烟的決心、但問題在澈底執行程度今年是禁烟禁絕年，也是總動員年，流毒百年的烟患是否禁絕：這要看當局的決心如何了！</p>
<p>作爲四川三患的土匪與「渾水袍哥」，這是歷年四川爲害社會的二大毒瘤，妨害社會秩序的惡毒障礙。動員戡亂，後方應以安定爲第一，但今年四川治安情形，尙末臻於樂觀。省參議會中，參議員就治安問題，紛紛向保安處長作熱烈質詢，陳質堅問：川陜邊區酉委黔彭一帶，大盜瞿北階橫行數年，省綏署有無斬草芟根計劃？周剛問，十六區的川康陝邊境，歷年爲烟匪的淵藪地，今年省綏署為配合禁烟，是否決心予以斬盡減絕？邵一揚羽：基層政治不健全，地方保安隊常有夥同鄉保長，包庇烟賭，縱容盜賊情事。劉鼎·李鳴和則同時爲保安隊叫屈，說保安士兵每月待遇僅食米三市斗，附食費一萬六千元，衣食不維，焉能保安？</p>
<p>所謂混水袍哥即是土豪劣紳，不法份子，社會上特殊勢力的混成品，他們往往藉特殊力量，作種種非法勾當，作奸犯科，不勝例舉。烟，匪，「渾水袍哥」，鼎足而三，形成今日四川社會三患，省綏署對安定治安，年來不遺餘力，鄧主席和保安處長也曾說明了治安的重要，淸剿的決心，平情而論，今年洽安情形，已遠較去年進步，但間題是尙未能與總動員配合而已！</p>
<p>動員戡亂，是四川繼抗戰衛國之後，對國家的另一重大責任，動員的先決條件要社會安定，在動員之前，我們願就四川省參議會最後大會中，參議員對四川當前政治，教育，社會各方而情况的紹介，從這裏覓取治理四川的切實辦法。</p>

<h3>桂省敎育概況　廣西敎廳近呈報敎部</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕廣西省教育廳，近將該省教育槪况，呈報教育部，茲摘錄其槪要於下：</p>
<h3>醫學院正計劃　併入廣西大學</h3>
<p>（甲）高等教育。該省專科以上校，省立醫學院，修建房舍五座，共有學生八班，一百九十二人，自財政系統變更，該院經費支絀，正與廣西大學洽商，將該院併入廣西大學辦理，省立藝術等校，有學生六班，一百七十六人。廣西桂林科學實騐館，已改為廣西科學實騐館，並採購大批器械，充實設備，繼續製造中小學理化儀器，最近該館將與省立科學館合併辦理。又西江學院，現已改歸省立，私立西南商專亦早復校。</p>

<h3>正在成長期中的　建國法商學院</h3>
<p>— 俠</p>
<p>南京的寗海路，已經是相當僻靜的街道，再向北轉入匡廬路，更是人烟稀少如入鄕野，這塊空氣淸新遠離塵囂的地方，正是讀書的優良環境，建國法商學院，就屹立在這理想的境界中。</p>
<p>談起校史來，還很年幼，可是她已經設立了法律，政治，經濟，合作，工商管理，及會計銀行等六系，並附設地政硏究所。主辦人爲中委張繼和前經濟部次長蕭錚二氏。蕭任院長，爲了專心致力教育，辭去了次長的職務。上學期行開學典禮的時候，他向學生們很堅決的聲明：「我辦學校，是爲了培植社會急需的眞正人才，本校旣非摹店，自然別希望在這裏用金錢就可買到文憑……。」同學們聽了之後，倒是幾人歡悅幾人愁，但我相信，歡悅的人一定會佔多數，因爲無鑰任何學校，壞學生究竟極少，大多數都是期望能在四年的大學過程中，獲得更多的眞實知識，以奠定以後服務社會的基礎。</p>
<p>由於半年來的事實證明，蕭院長並沒有一刻忽視他的主張，從考試上就可看出。暑假大考監塲極嚴，作弊的學生都分別予以懲處，有的記過，有的開除。其實考試的嚴格，應當是每一學校對於學生的最低要求，因爲在學生時代考試作弊，養成一種投機取巧的心理，將來到社會上一定易於貪汚違法，在我國遍地失學靑年，無校容納的現在，於其姑息養奸，讓平時不摸書本的學生在校中鬼混光陰，倒不如忍痛潰　，好留出空位給願意讀書的靑年。但凡一件事，必須獎懲並濟，才能收到更大的效果。建國法商學院訂定了一種學生成績優良者的獎勵辦法：凡操行良好，學期成績總平在八十分以上的，得免下學期學費，九十分以上加免雜費，九十五分以上則下學期分文不出，全數免繳（包括膳宿等一切費用）。由此可見學校當局對於靑年學子期望之殷切。所聘教授，都是國內外的權威學者，如林彬，楊幼烱，傅統先，樓桐蓀，壽勉成，任卓宣，湯惠蓀，鮑德澂，萬國鼎，梅仲協，張丕介，伍叔儻，范任宇，李慶麐等。教務主任楊幼炯氏，不僅是國內的法學專家，而且被選爲全世界十四位法學權威之一，一九四六年的世界年鑑中，對於他的生平及著述都有詳盡的記載。爲了提高同學的英文程度及增加會話實用的練習機會，下學期即將延聘外籍教授，必要時擬增加英文的學習時間，務求每人都能實際應用。</p>
<p>訓導係採用放任制度，對學生之行動不當，僅加以誘導或規勸，非不得已不加以硬性的制裁。因此校中空氣非自由，壁報如雨後春筍，各抒已見，琳琅滿目，無形中在學術思想方面養成了互相競爭不甘落伍的風氣。訓導處實施這種方策，結果是獲得了意外的成功。</p>
<p>我們常常看見報上談到私立學校向教育當局請求准予增加學費的消息，並有一度情形嚴重，傳出罷教的風聲，建國學院並不如此，相反的他們（學校當局）却處處爲學生打算，可能範圍內，決不增收費用，則以學費一項來說，上學期是卅萬元，下學期已決議維持原數。誰都知道這半年來物價是如何瘋狂的飛漲，而學費依舊，老學生下期每人僅繳五十幾萬元。這，在一個毫無外來經費補助的學校，確是勉力給與學生們超度的便利。</p>
<p>爲了人數的激增，校舍不敷應用，擬在暑假期中，完成可容一千到兩千人的大禮堂及課室宿舍等，因爲旣定計劃，即將擴充院系，增設研究院，改組爲建國大學。此次暑假招生，分在京滬兩地舉行，八月九十兩日考試，（上海區辦事處設本市塘沽路市參議會一棋），每系錄取新生五十名，預料下學期又將增加數百人了。</p>
<p>建國法商學院，雖在成長期中，但可以看出她已具備了發育健全的一切條件，我們期望她迅速長成，也許在這教育界極度貧乏的今日，更可看出她努力的光輝。</p>

<h3>工業協會等各團體　爭取限額分配權</h3>
<p>决向中樞當局提出六項建議</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業協會昨日下午三時，在慈淑大樓星五聚餐會舉行記者招待會，報吿工業原料限額分配權，及審議委員會因商業性同業公會無誠意，而不能獲致協議之經過。首由工協總幹事田和卿報吿工業界對工業原料問題之意見四點如下：</p>
<p>（一）工業必需原料直接分配於工廠，減少中間商層層剝削，使增加生產，減低生產成本，收抑平物價之效，而配合國策。同時侃政府所付出之外匯，發揮最高之效果。（二）進口商所訂購之貨物，以暴利為目的，不儘符合工業界需要，工業界直接取得原料，能杜絕黑市流弊。（三）限額分配處辦事不澈底，政府管制政策不澈底。（四）工業界並不希望原料輸入限額逐季增加，反之，希　其減少，而刺激國內自己生產原料，創立必要之重工業。</p>
<p>繼由工協理事潘士浩報吿分配審議會之失敗，商業性同業公會及輸管會限額分配處應負責任，自四月廿四日至七月卅日經十六次小組分配會議，化工原料·顏料·五金三項最主要物品，工業公會內部分配已順利完成，但最後商業公會拒絕出席，致分配協議無法成立，此點工業界咸表痛心。其爭執之癥結所在，政府外匯政策，貿易政策之不合理，引起工商界磨擦，交爭黑市外匯之非法利益。今後務請政府明定界限，予工業界以限額分配權。工業協會與工業同業公會，定本週三，推派代表十餘人，晋京陳述意見，機聯會，生產促進會，國貨工廠聯合會，國貨產銷協會等，爲開放對日貿易，亦於同日晋京，向中樞陳述國貨商之意見。工協決議向政府建議六項：</p>
<p>（一）輸管會將第一期配額分配何家，配額若干，詳細公佈。</p>
<p>（二）第二季限額分配率，先請限額分配處將工商兩業應得輸入原料之分配額，由工業協會負責協議分配，將分配結果報請限額分配處辦理，在協議未成立前，不得簽證。</p>
<p>（三）自第三季起，各工廠需要原料，應請限額分配處指定其種類及價値，直接予以配額權。如應用工業單純者，應由一業工業公會分配，如應用工業在二業以上者，應先交由工業協會，負責協議分配，報請限額分配處依據分配。</p>
<p>（四）外埠各工廠，交由各地工業協會負責分配。</p>
<p>（五）限額輸入原料不敷三個月應用時，得自辦外匯，或由各該業出口所得之外匯自行抵用。</p>
<p>（六）請短期內設立專營機構，供應各工業所需之原料。</p>
<p>同時上海市工業協會，曁全滬各工業同業公會，對處理限額輸入原料，並發表宣言云。</p>
<h3>產業工人改配菜油</h3>
<p>本年江南菜子實卜豐收，各產地業已先後登塲，業中人有識之士，估計產量約在二十萬担以上，由於最近當局進行產業工人配油工作，大豆昂貴，改以菜子榨油配售。由中信局會同榨油業等進行收購，現以一五〇億元貸款，絡續購得菜子六萬餘担，半數已運滬交與各廠榨油，每担菜油成本達八十八萬元，但產業工人配油每斤仍定四五〇〇元，榨油合約，日前已簽訂完成，規定由中信局將各廠以每担菜子榨得四十二斤菜餅，作爲榨油費。</p>
<p>目前市塲菜油價格較中信局搾油成本爲低，據稱係因下列各種原因造成：各榨油廠或販運商，熟悉當地收購情形，趁低吸收，商業機構辦事效率較政府機關爲高，廠商以借款比期，貶價出售。且重要產地如重慶等地，以新貨上市，價格低落甚多，致予太市以影響云。</p>
<h3>熱水瓶廠籲請　准予外匯自給</h3>
<p>本市熱水瓶廠業，在外匯統制後，出品陷於停頓。因各廠出品之熱水瓶，其銷行香港南洋羣島等地，佔全產量十分之六，估計每月出口數目，有二百餘億之鉅。二磅熟水瓶之市價，現爲每打國幣四十九萬元，在香港則售價爲港幣七十餘元，按照港匯黑市市價，出口商尙有利可圖。若由政府以官價港匯收購，則此貨到港須售二百元（港幣），勢必無人問津。以致出口商裹足，廠商則虧蝕不貲。本市全體熱水瓶同業紛向政府有關各機關呼籲救濟，要求開放南洋市塲，准予外匯自取自給，迄已多日，猶未獲政府批復。而中日貿易開放之議，又將見諸實施，我國對南洋之唯一市塲，岌岌可危，因此熱水瓶同業準備作進一步之呼籲，希望政府保持固有之南洋市塲，順從興情，立即開放外匯云。</p>
<h3>蘇農舉行　業務座談會</h3>
<p>江蘇省農民銀行，經營農貸農倉等業務，爲地方服務，設於全省各地之機構，現有六十二個分支行處。該總行爲謀加强業務，特於昨日下午在鎭江召集全省各業務繁重之分支行處負責代表，開業務座談會。出席者上海劉仕秀，蘇州曹棠，無錫蔣敬齋王亮豐，常州謝召南，鎭江魏家驥，南京林禮明，常熟王建升，徐州崔潔塵，揚州佘文波，南通陳孝慈，泰縣劉仁濤，泰興季可宗，興化李鑫林及該總行各高級人員。由總經理董轍主席，指示今後業務上應行注重之原則，並聽取各行處報吿。第二日上午八時，各代表邀請總行各高級人員，在河濱公園舉行茶會，以隨意談話方式交換意見。自十時起，在總行繼續開會，討論各項提案。</p>
<h3>廠盤調整後　固本皂激漲</h3>
<p>昨日用品市勢亦見挺秀，以固本皂廠盤提高至四十六萬元配出，塲內人心激昂，搜吸頗多，零星添補，胃口亦健，喊價由四十七萬五千節節上升，午收漲至四卞八萬三千元，比上日猛升一萬元。箭刀皂因持有棧單者配價四十八萬元，而昨市祗四十七萬五千元，雖上升五千元，但尙虧本息。其他光華牛牌日月等皂，去化亦尙佳，各升一二千至四五千元不等，惟黃祥茂獨見軋平。</p>
<p>火柴交易轉暢，美麗牌每箱上升四萬元，爲三百十六萬元，鳳凰牌亦漲一萬元，爲三百十一萬元。其餘老虎南京寗波等牌客胃香燥，市亦挺進不少。</p>
<p>火油市呈堅穩，高度桶貨八十三四萬元有成交，美半聽裝做十二萬七八千元，亞細亞同業喊十二一萬五六千元。</p>
<p>洋燭因原料貴，市仍堅昂，白禮氏每箱漲至五十萬，僧帽五十五萬，鷄牌四十萬元，惟天熱關係，交易平庸。</p>
<h3>香烟市氣堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以永泰和之派貨尙未全部提出，而同業需　依然强健，門莊去化活躍，頻加添辦，市上調劑籌碼仍不充沛，塲內貿氣濃厚，市勢迂迴上進，午市更形挺秀。十支大英烟上升至九百四十七萬元，有人買進，結果比上日回漲十三萬元。老刀烟亦昂至七百四十三萬亦有成交，比上日軋升十萬元。</p>
<p>五華哈德門走勢尙佳，價亦徵堅，其餘華商廠烟參差互見，在三五百元間上落惟金鼠牌烟價下跌較巨，每條下挫七百元，因聞華成公司又將辦理派貨關係。美貨六根駱駝馬力斯等條烟，及五十支茄力克三五水手等牌聽裝烟，因銷路平庸，市均趨疲云。</p>
<h3>江浙蠶絲事業概況</h3>
<p>中農發表詳細計</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於江浙蠶絲事業槪况，貸款比較，及生產增加情形，據中國農民銀行發表詳細消息如次：</p>
<p>本年春推銷蠶種約達一百五十萬張，包括土種折合在內，平均每戶養蠶二張，約有蠶農七十五萬戶，共產鮮繭約廿八萬担。其中七萬餘祖，可能繅製土絲廿餘萬担，已由該行舉辦貸款，由廠商繅絲，交由蠶絲產銷協導委員會。將來輸出，依照鮮繭每担一二〇萬元計算，約三三六〇億元。換言之，則每一蠶戶於一個月內，平均收入可達四十四萬八千元。對引導游資納入正軌，活潑農村經濟，實受裨益。該行鑒於江浙蠶絲生產，佔全國總產量之半。抗戰期間飽受敵僞摧殘，勝利後蓄意復興，以謀增產，舉辦蠶桑事業貸款，其有成效者，略列於次：</p>

<h3>以發展農業為重心　經濟改革方案特點</h3>
<p>樓桐孫氏對本報記者之談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕「經濟改革方案」經國務會議通過後，記者往訪全國經委會秘書長樓棝孫氏，探詢渠對該案看法。渠爲中委之一，三中全會討論「經濟改革方案」時，貢獻意見頗多，其後全國經委會討論該案，渠亦始終參與其事，故對該案最爲熟悉。</p>
<p>樓氏對此一方案極爲重視，將其比之爲我國「經濟大憲章」，據稱：我國本年共產生兩部大憲軍，其一爲元旦所公布之「中華民國憲法」，另一即八月一日經國務會議所通過之「經濟憲章」，後者在原則上係根據前者第十三章第三節國民經濟而來，故處處以國民經濟爲對象，對於農民及農業尤再三致意。憲法第一四六條曾規定「國家應運用科學技術……促成農業之工業化」，而方案前言亦謂「如何使農業國趨向於工業化，實爲今後建國最主要之課題」，可見後者實在爲表裏。</p>
<p>農本方案</p>
<p>經濟改革方案對農民及農業旣如此重視，因之亦可稱之爲「農本方案」，樓氏指出就經濟本質及環境言，中國實爲一農業經濟國家，中國人民生活形態及思想意識，迄未完全脫離此一範疇，故此案重心意義，最先在使廣大之農民與農村，還其應有之地位，並爲廣大農民與農村謀求出路，此點不特「農業」章中有詳盡之規定，即「工業」章亦規定「中國經濟以農業爲本，故非有自足之民生工業爲農業之保護，使農工業交流經濟，則中國經濟之基礎，不能確立」。該章第一條規定「工業應首先適應農村之需要」，前言中亦提及今後政策，應自利用大多數人民之能力處着手。使數萬萬人之生產能力及其總收入支持整個國家之財政，凡此皆是說明經改方案以農業經濟爲重心，期使我國農業得以現代化，再進而促進工業現代化。</p>
<p>縣銀行之重要性</p>
<p>在發展農村經濟工作上，縣銀行所負責任最爲繁重。樓氏指出，經改方案中所指之縣銀行，並非現行銀行法所規定之縣銀行，而為將來澈底重建後之縣銀行，他日將另訂法律，詳爲規定。</p>
<p>縣銀行之主要業務爲「發展農村經濟，便利地方建設，並配合地方自治之推行」。中山先生遺敎曾昭示縣應在政洽的及經濟自治，所謂政治自治，即做到眞正的民主基礎，而經濟自治則係經濟上謀求自給而言，全國各縣若咸能在政治上，經濟上自成一「自治體」，則全國所有各縣皆成爲中山先生所謂「建國之礎石」，一國若設有數千礎石，當不難臻於富強康樂之境，此實爲本章之指導原理。</p>
<p>根據方案規定，縣銀行之設置，以每縣一行爲原則，然並不規定各地須同時設置，而須視地方需要經濟條件及推行自治程度而定。縣銀行旣以配合地方自治爲其主要工作，因之，本體上即爲一種「自治銀行」，與國家銀行處於對立地位，猶之財政收支系統，有國家財政與地方財政之分者然。方案規定縣銀行應由中央銀行及省銀行酌量投資，作爲提倡股，並規定「縣銀行視其業務上之類別及需要，分別由中國農民銀行，交通銀行或中國銀行予以協助」，此種規定係因中國縣份過多，縣行成立之初，其業務或不易發達，故需母行爲其後盾。然方案中心意義現以重農爲主，樓氏認最好能以中國農民銀行在各地所設分支行作爲縣銀行之上級銀行餃爲妥當</p>
<p>有人認每縣各設縣銀行後，國家將不勝其負担，通貨亦將隨之膨脹，樓氏不以爲然，指出現代銀行在性質上，較之過去之銀行已有進化，今日之銀行，就其業務言，已不僅限於集合資本，樹立信用，投資生產營利事業，吸收存款等等，而已演進至一新階段，其主要職能爲「淸算」。在此種新觀念之下，唯有縣銀行始爲眞正金融實體，其情形與自治縣爲政治階層中之實體初無二致。因之，縣銀行之有中農行等爲其上級銀行，與政治上有省級如出一轍，二者皆爲「虛設」，其作用皆在從中聯絡。</p>
<p>全國經委會討論此一問題時，曾有若干委員强調省的重要性，認省爲實體的自治省，要進而强調省銀行之重要性，此種意見，在憲法上固有其相當根據，樓氏對之亦頗表贊同，惟相信中國目前政治制度，行政階層及行政區域分化，俟國家安定之後，定將大加調整，因之，縣銀行經濟問題（具有永久性之問題），與目前之省制（非絕對確定性者）不能相提並論。推而論之，强調省銀行之地位，論據亦不充足。方案中雖仍有省銀行之規定，然不能認其爲將來縣銀行之上級銀行。同時，省行分支行之設置，僅限於「本省重要政治經濟中心地點」，而不能普遍設置，此點應特別提及。</p>
<p>需要國也都援助</p>
<p>樓氏繼指出，中國旣爲一農業國家，欲使此廣土衆民之農業國向工業化之路邁進，除本身努力而外，當需要國際上之互助與援助，使工業化得早以達成。方案中對此點曾再三提及，前言中曾闡明：「以優惠方式，歡迎外國資本與技術人才，以達到工業化之目的」。工業章第十三條規定：「爲促進工業之發展，政府應明定辦法，獎勵外人投資及技術合作」。增產物資穩定物價章第五條亦規定：「政府應以優惠方式，向國外商洽機器及原料之借貸，以增加物資之供應」。樓氏強調指出，中國經濟進步，對世界和平殊爲重要，蓋中國經濟一日不工業化，即一日不能完全脫離國際經濟侵略，並將繼續爲國際商業競爭對象，此種情形足以引起世界之不安。深盼國際上，尤其美國，對於此點能加以同情考慮與澈底認識。（按：我政府對外人在華投資向所歡迎，政院七月三十日曾致函司徒大使，聲明我並不歧視外商，並歡迎美商向國營及民營工商業投資）。</p>
<p>若干外人批評我政府對私人在外存款未加動用，樓氏認經濟改革方案對動用私人在外存款有詳明規定，不能謂政府對此類存款將始終不予利用，渠指出方案工業章第九條規定：「政府應組設及倡導各工礦建設事業投資公司之設立，以長期資金投資於工礦建設事業，並利用華僑資金及存放國外之外匯資產，投資於此項組織，以得國外購入機器及原料」。財政章穩定幣値項第六條亦規定：「國人在國外資產，應限期申報，妥籌利用」。</p>
<p>全國經委會討論此一問題時，外間若干人即認此事不易辦到，蓋英美法律，例不許可將存戶姓名吿知他人，樓氏認現方案中所以仍如此規定者，其意義與刑法中「通緝有案」相似，目的在使在海外有私人存款之大人先生有所警惕，至少亦可達到道義上之目的，而實際上，政府將來未嘗不可採取其他有效步驟。</p>
<p>進出口連營辦法</p>
<p>方案商業章第三條規定：「出口事業應予積極獎勵，可由政府收購物資，以利出口，或指定若干物品，以進出口連營辦法，務使增加出口抵償進口」。此即各方最爲攻視之進口連營辦法。此種辦法係由「進出口連鎖辦法」演變而來，進出口連鎖辦法，由上海方面提出後前經濟政策委會曾數度加以討論，並有激辯，主管方面對此反對頗烈。樓氏常時亦爲參加討論者之一，曾據理力爭，棋氏認為實行進出口連鎖後，定可刺激出口，進而刺激生產，對於繁榮農業實大有助，當時在塲之中央銀行代表等，對此亦不得不予承認，至目前所規定之進出口連營辦法，僅爲一種縱的連營，其連營僅限於若干種類「本業」之連營，例如紗絲棉，運紗布出口後，以本身所得外匯購取棉花，此與以前所擬議之進出口連鎖辦法大不相同，方案未能將連鎖辦法列入，樓氏認實可惋惜。</p>
<p>從努力生產着手</p>
<p>方案結論曾引孔子之言稱：「生之者衆，食之者寡，爲之者疾，用之者舒，則財恒足」。樓稱：上述數語，若用現代術語表達，即各人應多做工，多生產之謂。我國經濟如此落後，且經長期破壞之後，國人咸應抽緊褲帶，苦幹實幹，凡與此相反之種種行爲，皆談不上經濟改革。方案工業章第十四條規定：「工資應力求合理，以謀生產秩序之安定，使勞資合力，以增加生產」。此一規定明示下列數點，第一，目前工資並不合理，第二，生產秩序尙未安定。必須工資合理，生產秩序安定，然後可談勞資合作，增加生產，樓氏鄭重指出，由於中國經濟結構之特殊，形成城市剝削農村現象，致生產者之待遇，工人亦較農民爲優。在此動員期間，深盼勞工同胞能深明大義，多做工，多生產。中山先生曾謂「社會經濟利益協調」，第十四條之規定用意亦復如此。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>樓氏對經濟改革方案之結論爲：方案本身共分三大部份，「生產建設」爲本方案之中心，爲一種動態之方案，須待多方面努力發動，「金融制度」爲一種靜態之方案，一經決定，須推行若干時期，至一財政」為金融與生產二者間，息息相關之聯繫細節的機括，經其調節後，生產得以格外發達，金融亦能善盡其功。方案謂：「生產事業不可一日無金融之滋養，財政收入亦不可一日失生產事業之支撑，金融政策，經濟政策與財政政策三者互爲因果，相濟相成，不可須臾或離」，即是此意。</p>
<p>自形式而論，修正案較原案綱舉目張，然就實質言，與原意已不無出入之處，至將來實施步驟，仍有待於詳爲硏究與規定，其情形與憲法頒布後尙須制定十大行憲法規，情形正復相似。</p>

<p>（答）（一）甲·先將包裹詳情單塡妥後，將包裹交駐局海關查騐，然後過磅繳費，由郵局掣給收據爲憑。乙·寄常德包裹係發由漢口及長沙轉遞，滬漢間由長江輪船幣運，約六日至八日，漢長間由粵漢路帶運，約二三日，長沙至常德由小輪帶運，約五日至八日。丙·寄常德包裹每公斤六千八百元。</p>
<p>（二）甲·寄福建涵江航信如能扣準滬榕航機班期，約三四日可到。快信比平信快，航快亦然，惟快多少則視各地情形而定，不能一概而論。乙·飛機停航期內，寄榕郵件交由輪船運送，有時並計算到達遲速，交機運至厦門轉遞。惟該綫已恢復飛行。丙·滬榕班機係每星期一四五飛行，榕滬則爲每星期二四五日。</p>

<h3>剪貼散文</h3>
<p>— 余怡</p>
<p>我的「楓辦集」序</p>
<p>今宵，沒有星星綴飾着藍空，黃昏兩凄凄地在飲泣；是夜風捲起落葉在呻吟？……我又是在燈下和漿糊，剪刀作伴，一番惆恨，一陳響往，長夜在鐘聲滴嗒中正飛馳向黎明。</p>
<p>『惟有眞實的生活，才可顯示出人生的眞諦』。李白鳳的現實的噩夢，使我看得握緊了拳頭，血流滾得熱刺刺地。我想：『向多數人的生活的紀錄透視，該也是瞭解這時代底人生活的眞諦吧』。於是，我的剪貼便揀中了散文。這年頭兒是苦難多淚的，無數無數的人在淚海血洋裏沉浮；但他們的紀錄却有着秋天的紅葉苦鬥西風的意義。於是，我的剪貼集便題上了『楓辦』。</p>
<p>散文是最充溢真摯的情感的。抒情的散文，我會曉得神往；描寫的散文，我會看得凝思；而充滿生之光輝的散文，我不禁想在朝陽初昇的山頂高歌長嘯了。</p>
<p>『楓辦集』裏的作品都是我所喜愛的；葉鼎洛的「桐窗雜憶」，洪爲法的「揚州續夢」，都使我愛不忍釋，因爲它們的字裏行間，有的在『刮黃風的時候，風捲着砂，掩蓋了一空，塞滿了街市，白色無光人在沙土中掙扎了……』的北國情調；有的是『億萬朶櫻花開着了，成了一片粉紅色的霧……』的旖旎；而「黃河」而「鼓浪嶼之波」，更予人以身歷其境的感覺。洪爲法則是風土的「觀音香市」，「廣陵花社」……給人以淡淡的苦味，有如喝一杯濃郁紅茶。</p>
<p>除了這些少有的通續性的外，申報「春秋」欄的一些一個字二個字題目的散文，也是我所喜愛的。像「窗」，「宮燈」，「燭火」，「帆」，「鴿鈴」……年靑而活躍的，眞可作爲初中作文的範本。</p>
<p>「春秋」的主編是王進珊先生，他大槪是一個喜愛眞，善，美的人，所以「春秋」的散文有一個特色，那是題材的善，作者情感的眞，辭文的美麗。像許多散生在山谷和平原的鮮艷的小紅花。</p>
<p>大公報的「文藝」也是很多散文的，但這些散文的氣質變得硬朗了。像野生的向日葵，在狂風暴雨裏拙殘不了一顆朝向太陽的心。如江原的「誓言」，「夢白骷的我們」，和其它作者的「小港」，「城市」，「窗外」……而同樣的已經停刊的聯合晚報的「夕拾」，文匯報的「筆會」，也有很多散文，都能別具一格。今天看着從這些副刊剪下的散文，我不禁默然「我不能忘記的……」「歡笑和哭泣」，「火」，「究竟是誰欺騙了你」……</p>
<p>「楓辦」裏的作者有好幾位我是認識的，但是時間的洪流，冲散得我們不相識了。有時還能會到，有時則唯有靜夜獨對着這些文章，當靑燈而祝福，祝福着這些跋涉在荒山僻野裏困潺草舖的多難土地的子民康健！</p>
<p>我剪了滿地的破碎報紙，也不知度過了多少寒暑的昏夜；我居然積聚了二百多篇自己喜歡的文章。在白天，當雁歌嘹亮的時候我翻閱，也常在乳燕南來的季節裏揭讀。因此很多的陌生的作家，而名字，性格，我都熟悉得像老朋友一樣。</p>
<p>你也愛剪貼一些自己愛好的作品嗎？我介紹你——散文是最情感流露的東西！</p>
<p>按：這篇文稿收到好久了，登與不登，始終在考慮着。不登的理由很簡單，因爲內容談到本刊，不免有自吹自捧之嫌。登載的理由呢，則因爲不僅談到本刊，也談到其他幾種報紙的副刊，還列舉了許多文章編目；此外作者更以個人經騐給讀者介紹了一種閱讀副刊，剪貼報紙的方法。所以覺得本文不但可以給各報副刊撰稿人許多　　，也可以給愛讀副刊的讀者一種方法上的參考。因此權當讀者意見，在今天一個月初的時候刊載了。至於本刊編者是否「喜愛眞美善」之類的問題，也正如說東坡腹中是否「一肚皮不合時宜」也，當這大熱天氣，似乎大可不必多加注意。（編者）</p>
<h3>仲夏夜之夢</h3>
<p>— 李芷</p>
<p>之一</p>
<p>在這些時候，我每感到白臺的煩躁，因此我愛子夜的恬靜。</p>
<p>在子夜裏，我聽不到犬吠，聽不到軍聲，唯一切安睡中而我獨醒，這境界是最爲可愛的。不如白臺之一目極望，在這時，夜，使週遭成爲江河，又成爲大海，似乎黑　　的毫無　岸。沒有什麼阻礙我的視禇，擋住我的想望，這時候人人會是多麼的自由，多麼的自在，覺得天地之間，我是一個光輝而可喜的存在了。</p>
<p>人，是每每愛做夢的，其實當你在子夜獨醒，不又是一個深沉的夜境，你可以撇開不願相見的嘴臉，你可以遠離整日苦憫的柴米，在自己的天地中創造了。盡你多少的天才，在　明未滅中未展開未來，剪裁一枝　花，　理一個想望，最拙劣的低能者在一己獨醒時，也會成爲天才的能手了。</p>
<p>原來，人的才能是同尋的，但是人的不幸，使他有不同的環境，不同的遭遇，因此有人直不起背，有人彎下了腰，那是凄楚的悲劇。不過當此良夜，卸下現實感的重擔，踱自己在自由的天地，夢裏的江湖中飛一下，雖然不能相濡以沫，平添兩翅，但是能够稍　片刻安寗，　心靈振翼而翱翔於一時，也是好的。</p>
<p>我現在就歡喜十夜，尤其在此仲夏，不　峭　，無憂　綏，容或拂來習習凉風，我更會感到滿懷沁凉的愉快。如果這人間尚有天國，尚有福地，那末唯仲夏子夜者是。</p>
<p>之二</p>
<p>當我鄰屬於這寂寞的江邊，我不願想象在幾個小時前這裏的熙攘，這裏的爭執。我也以最大的努力廻避一種想象，曾經有人像三千年前的屆子一樣懷着他的理想輿絕望在此與人世告別。</p>
<p>逝者如斯，不捨晝夜，江流不正如歷史的激流一　有去處而沒有回頭，千百年前如此，千百年後也相似，汩汩地淺唱低語以去。夜，使它更有精神，更多言辭，但是我又能和它對語些什麼呢？</p>
<p>今晚凉風習習，繁星滿天，應該每個人都在找着他自己的夢了，他們也許在哭，也許在笑。而我，也不是够欣　的嗎？境這麼一個夏夜視做夢境，我成了這個夢有中的主人了。</p>
<p>沒有比這樣仲夏夜之夢，更生動的吧，江流正在脚下，燈火留在江心，天上則是燦爛的星斗。我感到脚力更健，　智更明，眞想入水　覓，到倒影的星子。它們，不是最好的珠寶最亮的眼睛嗎？如果說，這是財富，那沒有比這樣的財富更爲可貴的了！</p>
<p>現在，我就想走入夜的遠處，那夜的遠處又有什麼呢？是不是可以尋到夜的盡頭，讓我繞着邊岸逡巡一週，在黎明與長夜之間，我不是可以看到瑰麗的　景，對比兩者的良莠嗎？有什麼可以懷疑的呢？子夜猶如白紙，讓我躑躅於夜之遠處成爲一個詩人，又成爲一個　師。也許我可以天才地寫下一章不朽的詩篇，也許我可繪成一幅驚世的名畫！</p>
<p>這樣，像莎士比亞一樣，讓仲夏之夜也在這貧瘠的土地留下一個色彩顯明的影子。</p>
<h3>「東窗事犯」小說</h3>
<p>— 子振</p>
<p>小說瑣記</p>
<p>近頃出版的馮沅君女士「古劇說彙」，內中的「古劇四考跋」說：『作劇的人何以有時也作小說，如金人傑（註六九）。』（五二頁）註釋說：『金仁傑是「周公旦抱子設朝」的作者，但他也作小說，見郎瑛「七條類稿」。』（九二頁）但這結論難於置信，原因是郎瑛的話並不可靠。</p>
<p>著者所根據的郎瑛的話，是見「七條類稿」卷二十三「東窗事犯」條，原文如下：</p>
<p>『岳武穆戲文，何立　　都，世皆以爲假設之事，乃爲武穆洩寃也。予嘗見元之平陽孔文卿有「東窗事犯」樂府，杭之金仁傑有「東窗事犯」小說，廬陵張光弼有「蓑衣仙」詩。樂府、小說不能記憶矣，與今所傳大略相似。張詩有引云：「宋押衙何立，秦太師差往東南第一峯勾幹，恍惚人引至陰司，見秦對岳事，令歸告夫人東窗事犯矣。後因即棄官學道，蛻骨今在蘇州玄妙觀，爲　衣仙也。」據此，數人宣有是事可知矣。否則何籌子孫世爲靑盲，而羅汝楫之子鄂州一拜岳廟即不起，豈非其證歟？洋洋赫赫，如此大事，果無報歟？若「夷堅志」載何仙無押衙之說，恐或遺之。』</p>
<p>清褚人獲「堅　田集」卷四也有同樣記載。原文首引「夷堅志」，次云：</p>
<p>『「江湖雜紀」載：繪旣殺武穆，向靈隱寺祈禱，有一行者亂言識檜間其居止，僧賦詩有「相公問我歸何處，家在東南第一山」之句，檜令何立物色。立至一宮殿，見僧坐決事，立問侍者，答曰：「地藏王決秦檜殺岳飛事。」須臾，數卒引檜至，身荷鍛枷，因首垢面，見立呼告曰：「傳語夫人，東窗事發矣！」「七修類稿」又載：元平陽孔文仲有「東窗事犯」樂府，杭金仁傑有「東窗事犯」小說，廬陵張光弼有「蓑衣仙」詩。樂府，小說不能記憶，大約與世所傳相似。詩有引云：「宋押衙何立，　太師差往東南第一峯　　，恍惚一人引至陰司，見檜對岳事，令　告夫人，東窗事犯矣。復命後，即棄官學道，蛻骨今蘇州玄妙觀　衣仙是也」。據此諸說，則當日實有是事，非止假說爲武穆雪寃也。』</p>
<p>兩相對照，「堅　集」明是鈔　，并且故憲更改文字又誤文卿爲文仲。「堅　集」是間接的第二手次料，固不可信；就是「直接史料」的「七修類　」，也同樣不可靠。郎瑛是明代萬曆間人成　也在萬曆中，去元代已遠，所說未必有堅强證據；而他自己也明說「樂府，小說不能記憶矣」，他著書時是憑着「嘗見」的記憶，並未　開書本比勘，甚至連元雜劇也未寓目而單靠曲目的。他的根據，大約是元　嗣成「錄鬼簿」吧。</p>
<p>按「錄鬼簿」卷上有孔文卿，卷下有金仁傑。孔文卿下註：「平陽人」，著錄「秦太師東窗事犯」一本，又註：「一云楊駒兒作」。明天一閣舊藏格抄本題目，正名是：「地藏王證東窗事犯」，「何宗立為此西山行者」。金仁傑名下有略傳，謂杭州人，授建康崇密務官，天曆二年卒。又著錄「蔡琰還朝」等　劇七種，「秦太師東窗事犯」（明鈔本無「秦太師」三字）也在其中。明鈔本於孔本下註「二本」，金本下註「次本」。明朱　「太和正音譜」於兩本下也各註「二本」。凡註「二本」，「次本」的，是說兩個作者各作有同名的雜劇一本，這是元劇的慣例。這樣看來，金仁傑所作的「東窗事犯」，明是雜劇，而非小說。「錄鬼簿」有鎬嗣成作弔金仁傑的凌波仙挽詞，也沒有說他著有小說。明鈔本附賈仲明作孔文卿挽詞說：</p>
<p>先生准擬聖門孫，析住平易一葉分。好學不恥高人問，以子稱得謐「文」。論編常有道弘仁。捻「東窗事犯」，是西湖舊本，明善惡勸化濁民。</p>
<p>可注意的是「捻東窗事犯」二句。按孔文卿是元雜劇　期的作者，而金仁傑是中期人物，稍後於孔氏。金氏是杭州人，他的雜劇當在杭州「按行」，也就是「西湖本」。孔氏之作較早，爲金本以前的舊本，因而賈仲明說他所作的一本，「是西湖舊本」了。這堅證更足證明金仁傑的一本，也是雜劇。現在流行的景印「元刊雜劇三十種」，有「東窗事犯」一本，未題撰人，但他的題目，正名和明鈔本「錄鬼簿」相同，這爲孔文卿之作。</p>
<p>或者有人疑心：金仁傑曾作有小說爲「錄鬼簿」所未載。但這懷疑也難相信。「錄鬼簿」記載雜劇作者，例必附記他們的其他著作，如屈彥英的「一百二十行」及「　錢奴」院本，王伯成「天實遺事諸宮調」，　君祥「愛女論」，沈和「歡喜寃家」，「瀟湘八景」，錢霖「醉邊餘興」，吳仁卿「金縷新聲」等等，而陸顚之的小說「好兒趙正話本」，也特別　明。金仁傑果有小說，似不會　而不載。又如是小說，鍾氏也不會把他放在劇目中（凡有其他著述，「錄鬼簿」例必附於小傳中。）更假如金仁傑旣有顯劇，又有同名的小說，小傳中也當註出，以免混淆，總之，就「錄鬼簿」看來，可以十分肯定金仁傑「東窗事犯」是雜劇，決非小說。其致　之由，完全是郎瑛的誤記。所以淸焦循「劇說」卷五謂：『孔文卿有「秦太師東窗事犯」劇，金仁傑亦有之，「惜不傳。」是最能辯別眞僞，不爲郎瑛所誤。</p>
<h3>輕盈</h3>
<p>— 匡瀛</p>
<p>一件白綢衫在竹竿上蕩了幾蕩，飄落在地上，那樣慰貼而平靜。像白雲無心，守住着對面的峯巒，不起一點波濤。我不想去拾起牠，怕手上沾染了泥土的氣息，而把牠染上塵俗。</p>
<p>一個拾了樹枝回來的小孩，口裏唱著沒有音節的小曲，向地上的白綢衫膘了膘，趦趄地走了過去。</p>
<p>這該是多麼輕盈而安閒的景象呵！</p>
<p>昨天我走過前村的溪邊，幾個洗衣女低語在溪邊光滑的石子上，杆砧緊貼在衣服上拍拍作響，向我冷然地瞥了一眼有，連低語都沉寂了。這次回來後，竟追回我十年往事，想起兒時枕上聽潮，我是海之驕子，而今，逗留在這山城荻隘之間，連一張熟悉的嘴臉都沒處找尋了。</p>
<p>看雪花飄散於水涯山嶺，想起沒有再輕盈的岸邊飛絮了；看窗外行人的匆促去來，想起了沒有再更輕盈的天邊飛燕了。但是，今夜燈下，遠行人，不會有像白綢衫飄落在地上的安閒輕盈，更何有於溪邊洗衣女的低語情懷，我却在數起屋角星星，一粒，二粒，那些數不淸失去　盈的故事。</p>
<p>遠寺鐘聲，知人間畢竟尚有　　的　跡。</p>
<h3>英·拜侖作：在翡冷翠與比薩之間的路上寫的詩節</h3>
<p>— 眞勤試譯</p>
<p>哦，別對我提起任何故事中偉大的名字；</p>
<p>我們靑春的日子才是我們光榮的日子；</p>
<p>甜蜜的雙十年華底桃金鑲和長春藤</p>
<p>值得你們所有的桂冠，不論你有多豐盛。</p>
<p>對於有了皺紋的額角，花環和王冠有什麼應用處？</p>
<p>這等於給枯死了的花朶洒上五月底　珠。</p>
<p>那麼，這一切裝在白頭上的　請滾蛋·</p>
<p>我哪　那衹能給予光榮的花　？</p>
<p>哦，名譽！如果我曾經歡喜過你底稱讚，</p>
<p>這不大會是爲了你那好聽的字眼，</p>
<p>倒還是爲了能看到愛人底明眸因此表明</p>
<p>她認爲我還值得做她底愛人。</p>
<p>衹有在這裏，我追求你，我找到你；</p>
<p>她底一瞥是最可貴的光，圍着你；</p>
<p>等到這光在我一生光明的經歷上前漢動，</p>
<p>我知道就是愛，我覺得這就是光榮。</p>
<p>〔附註〕這一首抒情詩，是拜侖於一八二一年十一月中作的，首次發表於一八三〇年作者底「書信與日記」一書中。第一詩節中所稱的桃金錢與長春縣，是靑春與歡樂底象徴，古希臘節日用以編　花環，長春藤又爲獻給酒神白克斯的一種植物。而勝利者的冠冕則以桂枝編成，故桂花代表榮譽。——譯者</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣這才把她這十來天征程的經過，遭受的驚風駭浪，和目前所處險惡環境，一一說明。往下算是一段追記。……</p>
<p>還在「八之秘密」計劃發動之前，松組首腦土肥原，貪功忌能，與黑龍會幾個執行委員聯絡，把「征服支那」軍事計劃大綱弄到手上之後，鶴見設法，探到這個　　內容，早想派人潯入松組，到山西去植下一座秘書電台，偵探松組行動，相機破壞。無奈自己手下，人力　薄，不　支配，欲行又止。此及回到東京，爲了探索「七封秘緘」，知道松組由裴北而萬全，而大同，而太原，勢力已逐漸擴大，再要不設法去遏止一些，將來如着戰事　延到了山西，在　　時間內，　　可以不費吹火之力，居攬山西全境。</p>
<p>同時土肥原還個老奸巨猾，所委用的手下，都是淸一色的松組，并且單門獨戶，組織電訊機構，參謀本部。和大陸　　總部，所有特別訓練電訊員，一個不用；　見任是厲害，也無法滲入這個組織。所以除了羅致人才，至山西設立支部之外，別無他法。</p>
<p>以耀羣的學識和訓練，難道還不能獨當一面，担負這個支部的組織責任嗎？無奈這個機構，需要日人，或精諳日語文的人，才能勝任愉快，　　一句日語不　，而且手下暫時只有一個小老虎，也是不懂日語日文，當然不能協助　　，做這「細作」領導工作。</p>
<p>但是事情已經風緊火急，不能爲了沒有　當人才，就此　置。經過　見，W君，和我三人細細研究一番，北平局勢又在這時急轉直下，所以我們決定一個折中辦法：把我們長辛店總部　務，一齊交託W君總部代收代　；所有　見的這一部分，一齊移到山西去；另由W君用總部名義，委派耀羣跟我們同去，率性擴大工作，組織合反間諜網：關於探索松組消息的細作工作，由我和「〇四」担任；行動方面，由耀羣指揮。如有緊急措置，超出我的能力之外，則由鶴見來辦理。鶴見如能分牙，當然常川駐晋，和我們一起工作。</p>
<p>當初鶴見由東來電，吩咐移植山西，耀羣已由我這裏得了消息，心下十分高興；一方面也計劃到東北老寨，找幾個人才，一齊去工作。後見鶴見到北平來，因探索「秘　」失敗，精神似乎萎糜，並不提起這事，心下當然　怪。到了按捺不住的時候，當面向鶴見提起這話，鶴見雖是含混應付着，倒不像W君那　直接痛快，一口應承，答應供給一切需要。這麼一來，耀羣很合理性地發生了一個小小誤會。</p>
<p>這個小小誤會，汙積在耀羣心下，等到萍子一到北平，在鶴見與僞警備司令的僞金司令衝突當口一現身又決定在當晚幾小時內，就要把鶴見一陣風　到上海去，於是由小誤會一變而演成某種　覺，一種男女之間，常有的玄而又玄的錯覺，這才眞然投袂而起，向W君　令，要求獨當一面，上山西去工作。</p>

<h3>原子與分子之槪念</h3>
<p>— 曾石虞</p>
<p>原子之槪念，現人皆知起原於希臘。惟古希臘人士所以對於物質終極之構造作此探本追源之思想者，乃由於其從事辯證之學者漆諾（Zeno）曾立論，謂神話中捷足如飛之勇士亞　利士（Achilles）不能追過一龜。漆諾所設之辯法及條件，即亞　利士於追逐龜時，必先宜達到龜最初啓行之地點。當彼達到此地點時，則龜於此時問必已向前移動相當之距離。迨彼適跨過此距離而達到龜第二次啓行之點時，而龜又已前移矣。故循此遞推，彼終不能追越此緩行不息之龜也。巧辯與詭辯乃希臘人士之所尚。對於漆諾此似是而卻非之推論乃有駁之者。駁之者即謂若設想實際之距離不能任意作無窮盡之割裂。意即不能分割之至無窮小者則齊，諾之結論即不成立也。以此類之思想推用於實際之物質，果物質用物理之方法亦可以加以無窮盡之分裂乎？若物質被分割時亦有一最後之限度者，此即原子槪念之起點矣。</p>
<p>希臘哲人中倡立原子學說最早者。即爲狄獲克利特士（Democritns）。依其意宇宙所包含者，乃慮無所有之空間，外此即爲無窮數而形體極小且不可更分割之原子。物體之存憾乃全由於成羣原子之集散。此種推想雖甚精實，但無實騐之佐證。迄至近代科學發達，原子之學說乃能臻說眞確。</p>
<p>狄謨克利特士之生約在在西歷紀元四百年前。迄至近代化學萌芽十九世紀初英國之學者達爾敦因欲對於化學中已由實騐所發現之定律作一系統之說明，對於物質之構造乃建立其原子之學說。其理論不僅比之希臘人士所揣想者更爲明晰，且彼更推論原子旣爲不可更分割而極微小之單位，各原子與另一類之原子之化合，必取一整數而互成簡單之比例以構成不同之物質。此即謂甲類之一原子必與乙類之一，二，或三，四等整數之原子相結合，原子比例之數值不同，則所構成之物質即不同其性質。此推斷乃達氏理論中最重要而極卓異之特點。果此推論於實騐之結果中能被證明且不發現例外者，則物質之構造即誠如達氏所應想，而實由於極小單位之原子相集而成也。達氏於未宣布其理論之前，已發現其倍比定律。此定律即云凡一原素與另一原素相化合可成多種之物質時，取前種原素之一定量則各化合物中所含　種原素之量必互成簡單之倍數。此定律之說明即可由達氏理論中最後之推論以得之。達氏復取甲烷及乙烯爲例。此兩化合物中　　重量之　所化合物之　，適成一與二之比例，後比化學中之愈　愈多，　適愈長以證明達氏理論之確切。</p>
<p>原子爲物質構合時最小之單位，似可以想像得之，惟原子之微小果至若何之程度則憑達氏之理論，吾人仍無法可得一具體槪念。聚多數之原子而成分子，若吾人能窺知分子之體積，且更知一分子中不同類之原子果各有若干，是原子之體積，亦可從而推知其大略矣。惟分子亦爲微小之物體，凡各物質微小至若何之限度始爲一單位分子，此亦非以尋常之方法而可測度之也。因此吾人對於分子必須有確切之規定。由此規定吾人乃可進而推測分子之大小，能作爲分子之定義者其爲亞伏格　羅之定律乎？亞氏定律之言曰「在同溫同壓，凡各氣體在同一容積之中其分子之數目相等」因此吾人對於分子之槪念乃可作如下之規定矣。取同壓同溫下同容積之各種氣體，吾人測之，數之，量之，計之，苦吾人發現各有一相同之數值，此即爲吾人所欲追尋之分　之數值也。凡氣體在一定情况下取其一定之容積，其中必有一定數值之分子，吾人若能求得此數值，且更能知一分子中各原子之數目，則原子亦成爲可以量可以數之個體矣。近代化學之進步與原子構造之研究之能精進者皆由於吾人不僅已知原子實有其體，且可容許吾人之度量與計數止。</p>
<p>學者因對於物質推究其是否可以作無窮盡之分割，乃有　子之結論，以此問題之思想應用於研究　學之現象，十九世紀末　發現，終始有極而動行並無積累之電流，乃爲比之原子更見微小之　子密密相隨所組成。再以此類之思想應用於幅射能之研究，逾知能量亦有其不可更分割之單位——即量子是也。但先乎原子學說正式創立之時，歐洲之西人，對於　理學中之時間，及數學中之長度，覺其並無不可任意分　之限度，終演成微分學之發明，此亦爲人類思想中最有成績之創造。但凡此成就皆緣吾人對於宇宙之凡諸形相，欲研究其果可任意而無限分割而起也。吾國　子會有書云「徑寸之竿，日取其半，累世不絕」。此與希臘哲人漆諾所　之　題相類似，但吾國旣未因之而　生精深　學之根本觀念，亦未隨之而有確切原子理論之形成，此非吾人可引爲宛惜者乎？</p>
<h3>「月光城市」</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>大家認爲美國德克薩斯州的奧斯汀城，是世界上唯一用人造月光照亮的城市。正　別的城市用普通的街燈一樣，許多年以來，在廿九個鐵塔的頂上，用水銀燈的柔和的藍光，普照着整個城市，這些鐵塔都有十四層高照亮了城市的八平方哩。</p>
<h3>說雲母</h3>
<p>— 天夢</p>
<p>及其人工制造法</p>
<p>雲母在電機事業上，頗有一些價值，其原因是因爲它有某種其他物質所趕不上的特性。譬如說，組雲母可以很容易地分裂成極薄的葉片，而這些葉片對於通過的電却具有出人意外的高度電阻。雲母的質地頗爲堅軔而且富有彈性。一片質地佳良的雲母片，能够捲成七個直徑八分之一英吋的筒子而不破裂，如果你把這筒子加熱到華氏一千度，它仍然可以在一萬二千伏特的高電壓下當作一個良好的絕緣體。</p>
<p>因爲雲母不受熱與電的作用，所以雲母片多用來包裹電焙爐的發熱綫。不過最重要的雲母的用途，還是用在發電機，電動機及無綫電管上，因爲雲母可以用來隔離電流所經過的發熱部份，以消去短路及電力損失等不利。</p>
<p>在飛機上的電花栓中，雲母也已代替資質而起，這是因爲飛機的發動機所產生的溫度及壓力較之汽車發動機更高更大，而且溫度的變化情形也更劇烈的緣故。</p>
<p>汽車業也是雲母的大消耗者之一，這次戰前，每年　只用於開動發動機和發電機的整流器的便有二萬萬五千萬片之多。</p>
<p>其他如用於飾牆紙及其他裝飾品的光彩華麗，以及用於橡皮製造中所用防止過分凝黏的雲母粉等，也都需用雲母。</p>
<p>雲母之被人利用，在歐洲才只有三百年，印度較早，今日電業蒸蒸日上，需量更多，因之不得不用人工造法，以瀰自然雲母之不足。</p>
<p>人工雲母的造法，以德國人在其投降前兩月所發明者爲最成功，其法先將砂，冰晶石，以及其他原料放在石　坩鍋中加熱熔化，遂得一種混合物，當此混合物自攝氏一二七〇度冷至一二三〇度時，因經磁塲處理，即如自然雲母一般冷却分裂成片。然惜德人投降後無法繼續完成以供市塲，致未被人注重。</p>
<h3>戰時蘇聯地理學者之總動員</h3>
<p>— 嚴德一</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰期間，蘇聯地理學者之總動員工作，勝利後蘇聯科學院地理研究所所長格里葛里夫（A.　A.　Grigoricv）已有所報道。戰時工作始於一九四一年六月，由該院地理研究員與蘇聯地理學會會員共同合作，進行實地調查研究著述，成就良多，　功甚偉。</p>
<p>戰時蘇聯地理學者之工作，有兩大使命，最爲迫切。一爲前方作戰部隊之地理讀物。戰綫綿長，戰區廣　，自然與人文景象，錯綜複雜，戰士到處人地生疎，惟賴實地調查之地理情報，始能進退有據，生活適應，二爲後方國防建設之參考資料，砲火摧毀，工廠　建，戰略上之　行整理配備，必以全國之資源分布及交通運輸爲依據，始能供求相應，工作安定。蘇聯此次對德大戰，初挫後勝，前方戰塲遠及中歐與東南歐洲，後方建設，開發歐亞大陸之腹地，秘密偵察，冒險探求，蘇聯地理學者戰時在前後方之　重任務，　爲艱鉅。</p>
<p>前方作戰部隊之地　服務，蘇聯作戰區域之廣，大於任何他國。戰塲遍布國內外，軍行所至，對於當地之山川形勢風土人情，有賴各地之地理讀物，隨時備用。遂由地理研究所負責編著供應。初兩年內先後完成羅馬尼亞，匈牙利，德國東部（自環境）德國南部（經濟）挪威·芬蘭（自然）土耳其·阿富汗（經濟）新疆各處之地誌，皆屬地理學者實地調查之情報。對於水陸交通之路綫比較，飛行塲地之天氣變化，詳盡縝密，準確新穎，參謀部軍令部遂能因時因地制宜，決勝機先。蘇聯戰塲之各種攻勢，以季節性著稱，蓋在戰術方面，蘇聯部隊以能善於利用小地形及地面景色變態見長，蘇聯地理學者對於各地景色之研究，更處處與植物學者土壤學者，最密切之合作，因得作完善之報道。</p>
<p>蘇聯對德戰爭最初之失利，莫大於淪陷區域之破壞，與工廠之被迫撤退。兵工廠之內遷與國防工業之重建，雖爲工程師與企業管理家之責任，但工廠撤退與創立之新址，必擇原料豐富運輸便利之地點爲　本條件。蘇聯地理研究所首先　護哈薩克共和國爲其設計之區域。哈薩克本爲歐亞大陸之腹地草原，領域廣　百萬方哩，資源富藏，　任何一道防綫遙遠，絕不處敵軍之威脅，實爲蘇聯國防最安全之區域。一九四二年，蘇聯地理研究所在哈薩克工作時，處處與馬拉山資源動員委員會之工作配合，更進而研究整個西利利亞之價值，此均爲蘇聯科學院院長康　諾夫（VL.　Komarov）之　　傾　，領導其事。</p>
<p>哈薩克之經濟動員，誠爲一偉大艱巨之工作，其地爲中亞一大內流腹地，閉塞偏僻，自然與人文地理案　茫然，蘇聯地理研究所之工作，首以　繪地圖爲　矢，內地國防建設，端頼糧食與原料之增產，中亞腹地農業開發可能性之分析，亟需有確切之估計及變化之預測。哈薩克之北部與中部，爲著名之乾燥區域，每年僅春季三五個星期內有充足之雨水，地下泉水之如何利用，水利工程之設計興建，必先詳察地面逕流之分布系統，整個地形圖之測繪，實爲修水利興農業之　本工作。其他地理條件之研究亦未忽視。中亞荒涼腹地，今有棉花橡皮草及糧食等農產，非偶然也。　（上）</p>
<h3>電鱔和電達</h3>
<p>— 西漪</p>
<p>魚類之中，身體帶電的很多，像電鲇電外來　，電　等，都是很著名的例子，可是發電力最强的，要數電鱔了。</p>
<p>電鱔學名是Electropliorus　Eleotricus　，體重可三十磅，平均身長五呎，尾部特長，可四呎許，爲　電最强的部分，其强度可以電擊人畜，達三十呎之遠。尾部有百分之六十爲　體索（Eleotric　Tissue）尾尖爲陰極，頭尖爲楊極，兩極相接，即可構成完全之電路，發生强烈之震動，以擊拒敵害，保護自身，攝取食物，以求生存，常有摘鱔的人，不明此理，手攬此蛇形電鱔，用力過猛，往往於無意中遭電鱔尾擊，而發生一種莫明其妙的感覺。</p>
<p>電鱔在游泳時，能　射一種大　　而且快速的　　　。如同電達（Radan）一般，以試探周圍的情形，牠的方法，是由尾部後端的電細胞，放射每秒五十次强五十伏達的電　衝碰（Radar　Lmpuloes）以試探水中有無食物，或敵害的存在。如衝碰達到小魚身上，而有反應，雖遠在一百呎以外，電鱔部之細孔，即可收到此種反應感覺，因爲牠的頭部，是可以當作觸角用的。旣經用雷達探得小魚所在地位後，雷　立即由腹部發射五百五十伏達的强電，直向目的物射來，以昏迷或殺死此小魚，從而捕食之。</p>
<p>據美國哥倫比亞大學，奈滿山博士（Dr.　David　Nachmansohn　of　Columbia　University）的研究，這種電鱔所發出的雷達衝碰，因爲過於快速，幾爲人類神經系統所不及感覺，但由此所得的化學反應，證明和神經活動有關，並能確立人類神經衝動的化電關係。此種發現，據說對於治療化學性的神經病，將有特效。</p>

<h3>Resource Committee Plans to Develop Coal Mines in Central and Southern China; Requires 80 Billion, Requests Additional Funding from the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] According to an investigation by the Resource Committee, the coal mines in Central and Southern China that are suitable for development include the Xuanlu Coal Mine south of Luoyang in Henan, the Ganxi Coal Mine in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, the Xiangyong Coal Mine in Yongxing, and the Nanling Coal Mine in northern Guangdong. All of these meet the conditions for mining and are currently being mined on a small scale. However, if mechanical equipment is strengthened and work is intensified from now, daily production can reach 2,800 tons by the end of this year, with gradual increases to 5,800 tons per day by the end of next year, or approximately 180,000 tons per month. By the end of the following year, monthly production can reach 400,000 tons.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] The Resource Committee believes that the coal used by the industries and transportation businesses in major cities in southeastern China mostly relies on coal produced in the Northeast and North China. However, the coal sources in the Northeast and North China are dwindling daily. Although Taiwan can supply 80,000 tons of coal per month, it is still insufficient to meet the needs of Shanghai alone, resulting in a significant loss of foreign exchange due to overseas purchases. Therefore, the committee has formulated measures to strengthen the development of coal mines in Central and Southern China, requiring a budget of 81.85 billion yuan. This has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and additional funding. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has referred it to the Budget Review Committee for examination.</p>
<h3>Coal Production Increase Conference Concludes; Suggests Raising Taiwan Coal Purchase Prices; Requests Expanding the Scope of Draft Deferment for Miners</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] The Coal Production Increase Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs concluded successfully at noon on the 3rd after two and a half days of meetings. Representatives from various regions will also return to their respective areas and strive to increase production based on the resolutions of the conference. The fifth session was held on the morning of the 3rd, chaired by Chen Qitian, and passed the following resolutions: (1) Regarding the control of Taiwan coal, the conference recommends that the Taiwan Provincial Government instruct the Coal Adjustment Committee to appropriately increase purchase prices. (2) Regarding measures for miners' exemption (deferment) from military service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is requested to consult with the Ministry of National Defense to appropriately expand the scope of draft deferment for miners. (3) Regarding the crackdown on private kilns, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is requested to consult with local governments to strictly enforce crackdowns. Other issues such as coal mine taxes and work competitions were also decided concretely. After the discussions, a closing ceremony was held around 1 p.m. Minister Chen delivered a speech, expressing that the government would adopt the requests made by the representatives of various mines and hoped that the mines could strive to produce and fulfill their due mission. After the closing ceremony, the Resource Committee hosted a luncheon for the attending representatives. After the meeting, reporters interviewed representatives from various mines, who expressed satisfaction with the conference and believed that with the assistance of the government, they would be able to achieve the goal of increasing production.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhen Discusses the Japan Question; Provides Commentary on Four Aspects: Politics, Economics, Education, and Law; All Elements of Aggression Should Be Abolished or Corrected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Political Council, spoke to reporters on the 3rd about various issues related to dealing with Japan. Lei studied at Tokyo Imperial University and has a deep understanding and considerable research on Japan. He believes that the following principles should guide the handling of the Japan question: (1) The attitude towards Japan should be based on the spirit of "not dwelling on old grievances and transforming enemies into friends" as proclaimed by Chairman Chiang. Be lenient towards things that are suitable for the peaceful life and reasonable needs of the Japanese people, and be strict towards things that could enable Japan to recover and retaliate. (2) Utilize enlightened Japanese figures to control Japanese education and utilize Japanese technicians in various departments to accelerate China's industrialization. He then provided commentary on four aspects: politics, economics, education, and law. Regarding political issues, he believes that all efforts should be made to promote the collapse of the Japanese emperor system and the entire imperial family. In particular, the position of the emperor must be revised in the Japanese constitution. Secondly, the ideas of divine right and Bushido spirit should be thoroughly eradicated. Furthermore, the Japanese police system, as a tool to assist the Japanese government in enslaving the people and controlling their thoughts and lives, should also be thoroughly reformed. Regarding economic issues, Lei believes that heavy industry and military-related industries should be completely abolished, and the dismantled machinery and equipment should mostly be used as part of the reparations to China. Light industry should be strictly limited, and machinery and equipment beyond the limit should also be used as part of the reparations to China. The textile industry can be allowed to exist as much as possible, but it should not hinder the development of China's light industry. At the same time, the Japanese land system should also be explicitly stipulated in the peace treaty and thoroughly reformed. Lei mentioned several points regarding education: (1) Most of the Japanese vocational schools and universities are actually designed and researched institutions for external aggression and should be reorganized separately. (2) The textbooks used in Japanese primary and secondary schools should be thoroughly revised. (3) Military training in universities and secondary schools and military management in primary school physical education should be thoroughly revised. (4) All levels of military schools and public and private organizations with military significance should be abolished. Lei believes that many Japanese laws contain anti-democratic and aggressive clauses and should be revised or deleted accordingly. Lei emphasized that China and Japan should follow the path of genuine friendship in the future to achieve the ideal of Pan-Asianism advocated by Sun Yat-sen.</p>

<h3>Special Plane Flies to Gansu Province to Search for Missing Transport Plane</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] After a Chinese Air Force C-47 aircraft carrying 26 passengers went missing on the morning of the 31st of last month en route from Hami to Lanzhou, the Air Force Headquarters here today dispatched a special plane fully loaded with emergency food and medicine to search.</p>
<p>[United Press, Dihua, 2nd Dispatch] After a Chinese Air Force C-47 aircraft went missing between Hami and Lanzhou on the 31st of last month, there has been no news of its whereabouts. The Chinese Air Force fleet, originally scheduled to depart for the search today, has postponed its departure to the 3rd due to insufficient preparation. The search area will be near Jiayuguan, as the aircraft lost radio contact with the ground when flying to that area. Chinese Air Force officials stated that if the aircraft landed in the Gobi Desert, the 26 passengers on board would have a better chance of survival, but if it landed in the mountains, the chances of survival would be slim. The passengers on board included American female reporter Stephanie and the son of British Member of Parliament Sorenson.</p>

<h3>U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission Releases Figures on Surplus Supplies Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd Dispatch] The U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission recently released its quarterly report on handling foreign affairs, stating that during the quarter ending June 30, and previously, the surplus supplies provided by the United States to the Chinese government totaled approximately 100,000 tons. This amount accounts for approximately 35% of the total surplus supplies that China can obtain from the United States. As of now, the cost of the U.S. surplus supplies obtained by China is approximately $170 million. The report stated that the Chinese government was only able to begin large-scale transportation of these supplies in the quarter from April to June because the Chinese government had signed contracts with several civil aviation ships to assist in transportation and had established camps on several major islands to facilitate loading operations. In the near future, the United States will announce surplus supplies worth $550 million, most of which have been sold to the Chinese and Philippine governments under wholesale agreements. It is expected that shipping measures within China can be completed within six days. The report also stated that in connection with the sale of these surplus supplies, the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission has begun a plan to acquire real estate in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Ping (Beijing). The United States is currently discussing with the Chinese government how to acquire certain real estate to supply embassies and other institutions for office space and staff dormitories. The United States may also acquire some good real estate in China as part of the compensation for shipping surplus supplies to China. In the past quarter, the cost of the property declared as surplus supplies was approximately $10 billion, of which 81% has been processed, but the selling price is only 23% of the cost.</p>

<h3>Korean Trade Delegation Arrives in Hong Kong; Immediately Transfers to Various Parts of South China to Investigate the Economy; Brings a Large Quantity of Ginseng to Exchange for Salt</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 3rd Dispatch] A Korean trade delegation, led by Lee Kim-beom, Director of the Korea Trade Bureau of the Import and Export Department, and Kim Tae-dong, Salt Affairs Commissioner of the Finance Bureau, arrived here yesterday. The mission of the delegation is to inspect the economic situation in China and Hong Kong in order to promote Sino-Korean trade. The delegation, which was permitted to come by the US military authorities in South Korea, brought 2,000 catties of ginseng, packed in 27 boxes, in preparation for exchanging it for 50,000 tons of salt, which they desperately lack. Kim discussed the situation in South Korea, saying that South Korea is different from North Korea, and currently all aspects are progressing smoothly under the guidance of the US military authorities. The government that is currently striving for complete independence in South Korea is still a provisional government. In order to promote trade between Korea and South China when necessary, the South Korean government plans to "establish a commercial office" in Hong Kong. During his speech, Lee emphasized the close cultural, political, and economic relations between China and Korea. He expressed regret over the current war in China, but he firmly believes that China can overcome the difficulties and become a stabilizing factor in the Far East. During its stay in Hong Kong, the delegation plans to meet with Hong Kong Governor Grantham and discuss various issues to promote Sino-Korean trade with local business leaders. The delegation will also go to Guangzhou and other parts of South China to investigate.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Holds National Congress; Elects Executive Committee Members</h3>

<h3>Recent Measures of the Jiangsu Provincial Government; Strengthen Security, Promote Conscription and Taxation; Clear Land Rights, Implement Rent Reduction in the Pacification Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Zhang Yulin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Information Office, held a reception for reporters in Nanjing at 6:00 p.m. on the 3rd to report on the political situation in Jiangsu Province. He stated that after the victory, among the 63 counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, only the areas south of the Yangtze River were relatively stable, and no villages in northern Jiangsu were completely integrated. Although the general situation after the complete recovery of northern Jiangsu was not ideal, it was still somewhat gratifying to the people after the tragic experience. The Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department is working hard to organize and promote household registration and military service. It is also paying particular attention to clarifying officialdom, eradicating corruption, and improving grassroots political organizations. The strict prohibition of opium and the preparation for elections are also actively underway. In terms of finance, the central government approved a budget of over 34.9 billion yuan in revenue and over 51.2 billion yuan in expenditure for this year, with a shortfall of 16.2 billion yuan, which will be supplemented by the central government. However, the actual expenditure difference is still large, and the adjustment of tax rates is the only way to remedy this. The finances of various counties and cities are extremely difficult, with deficits exceeding 30%, which is a serious problem. In terms of education, there are four provincial-level vocational schools and above, fifteen high schools, eight normal schools and rural teachers' schools each, and approximately 206 other county-level private secondary schools. There are 9,539 national schools, with approximately 100,000 secondary school students and 930,318 primary school students. Before the war, there were approximately 30,000 secondary school students, and the current increase is three times that. In terms of construction, 1,600 kilometers of highways were repaired this year, 77 bridges were newly built or repaired, and 3,349 meters of seawall were built, using over 10,000 zhang of piles. In terms of security, regional suppression is currently being implemented, and the provincial security force has been increased by four regiments, doubling the original force. In terms of land and grain, 3,903,249 shi dan (approx. 100 kg) have been collected from 38 counties, including Tongshan and Jiangning, in 1946, which is approximately 75%. This year, the Executive Yuan approved the payment of 1.2 shi dou (approx. 12.5 kg) of actual grain per yuan, with a collection of one part and a loan of half a part. Last year, in addition to the 30% allocated to the central government, Jiangsu Province purchased 800,000 dan of grain, which exceeded the limit. In terms of land administration, emphasis is placed on the handling of land in the Subei Pacification Area and the implementation of a general land rights clearance. Currently, the countermeasures in the recovered area of Subei are to prohibit retaliation, chasing rent, and evicting tenants, and to implement a 37.5% rent reduction. Dongtai, Xinghua, Huaiyin, and Suqian, which are designated as the Sixth Administrative Region, have been designated as experimental counties for the implementation of the central government's land treatment regulations. Regarding social affairs, health, personnel, training, accounting, and statistics, Zhang also provided detailed reports. Zhang continued: After the recent promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, equal emphasis is placed on suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Jiangsu Province's future work will focus on three points: (1) Stabilizing Subei and consolidating Jiangnan. Local forces have been gradually strengthened. (2) Conscription will begin on August 7, combining conscription and voluntary enlistment. (3) Military food and civilian food will be planned and considered together, with a collection of one part and a loan of half a part, which may begin on September 1. In addition, due to the break in the Muhe River, the Xu-Hai area has become a vast expanse of water. It is hoped that the central government will allocate more relief funds to save the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Fellow Qinghai Natives in Nanjing Welcome Xirao Jiacuo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Fellow Qinghai natives in Nanjing held a tea party at the meeting room of the Central Organization Department at 3 p.m. on the 3rd to welcome Master Xirao Jiacuo, who was recently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. More than ten people, including Liu Wenya, Tan Mingyi, and Qi Ziyu, attended. Li Dexian chaired the meeting and delivered a speech, hoping that the Master would promote Sino-Tibetan culture and strengthen the relationship between the central government and Tibet in order to complete the unification of the country. The Master then gave a reply, explaining the crux of the Tibetan issue and his own aspirations to strengthen the unity between the border regions and the central government.</p>
<h3>New Cars on the Ping-Han Railway Begin Scheduled Use</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd Dispatch] Thirty-five newly assembled first, second, and third-class carriages (including sleeping cars and dining cars) of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau have been designated as three trains, "Peiping," "Wuhan," and "Yellow River," and will begin running between Hankou and Zhengzhou around the 10th. Seating will be strictly assigned. Today's test run was successful.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Hawkers Petition for Extension of Relocation Deadline</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 3rd Dispatch] 301 hawkers from the East and West Han Yuan Streets in the central district of Hong Kong gathered in front of the police station all day on the 1st to petition for the revocation of the relocation order. After careful consideration by the police and municipal health authorities, it was decided to extend the deadline by another two months.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Special Envoy's Mission is to Explore Ways to Aid China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The United States' intentions towards China will not be known until Special Envoy Wedemeyer returns home. Officials revealed that Wedemeyer's delegation to China was not only appointed to investigate the general situation in China but also to bring back correct methods for presentation to President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall so that they can provide possible assistance to the Chinese government. It is expected that the United States will attempt again to engage with senior Soviet leaders within the next week or ten days to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the organization of a provisional government for all of Korea.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources told United Press that action is expected before Marshall leaves Washington for Brazil on August 11 to attend the Pan-American Conference. The United States' action may be to send another note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Although U.S. officials have refused to disclose the contents, it may be to draw Molotov's attention to the fact that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea have reached a hopeless stalemate between the commanders of the two countries' forces. It is necessary to take decisive steps at the senior leadership level of the two countries. It is expected that the United States will draw Molotov's attention to his statement that he sent a letter to Marshall earlier this year suggesting that senior officials from both countries review the situation in Korea. Molotov suggested that this review be given to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for another chance.</p>
<h3>Northeast Facing New Crisis: An Economic Observer Discusses the Northeast Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The inspection group led by U.S. President's Special Envoy General Wedemeyer is about to go to the Northeast for an on-the-ground investigation. It is generally predicted that Mr. Wedemeyer will obtain extremely detailed and valuable information in that area to assist in the preparation of his report. Recently, an economic observer who has just returned from the Northeast stated, "The Northeast is currently facing a new crisis. This crisis has been gradually exposed since the Japanese surrender. The people of the Northeast now universally recognize the importance of national self-salvation and will not compromise with any external coercion. Therefore, the future development of the situation deserves serious attention. We hope that General Wedemeyer will be able to gather more information to assist in the review of 'Stabilizing the Northeast means stabilizing Asia, and stabilizing Asia means stabilizing the world,' which will greatly contribute to world peace."</p>
<p>The Process of Taking Over and Reorganizing</p>
<p>Referring to the process of taking over and reorganizing the Northeast, he stated, "The Northeast was the base where the Japanese bandits used the Chinese to control the Chinese and used war to support war. They painstakingly managed it for more than ten years, and various economic constructions were quite impressive. To name a few major ones, such as the Shenyang arsenal and the Tiexi industrial zone, the Xiaofengman hydroelectric power plant in Jilin, the Dalong Science Academy in Changchun, the agricultural experiment station in Gongzhuling, the reclamation fields in Panshan, the fruit orchards in Xiong Yue, and the coal and iron mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Anshan, very few industrial and mining enterprises in the country can match them. After the Japanese surrender, the government immediately issued an order to organize the Northeast Headquarters, redividing the provinces into Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an, nine provinces, and announced the personnel of the nine provinces and two cities to engage in takeover work. After the takeover personnel from various departments arrived in Changchun one after another on October 9th of the 34th year of the Republic, the Soviet army's attitude repeatedly changed and did not transfer the administration of the occupied areas to our government in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. They repeatedly postponed the withdrawal of troops, and at the same time, illegal elements were able to take the opportunity to organize armed forces, expand their power, and implement local separatism, hindering the takeover. It was not until the Soviet army withdrew in March of the 35th year of the Republic that, following the progress of the National Army, the takeover work was successively launched from Jinzhou to Shenyang, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and then to Suhe, Andong. In addition, the two cities of Harbin and Dalian, and the five provinces of Songjiang, Nenjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an, are still awaiting takeover. Before the government took over, some of the enemy's and puppet's remaining industrial and mining equipment, important materials, and the inherent property of the people of the Northeast were transported away by the Soviet army, and some were brutally destroyed by the communist bandits. The old essence, the remaining is less than 40%. According to the Pauley Mission report, the direct damage suffered by factories in the Northeast during the Soviet occupation period reached US$858,000,000. If the repair costs are included in the estimate, it should be at least US$2 billion. At present, the Shenyang arsenal, Fushun coal mine, Anshan iron mine, Xiaofengman power plant (no investigation has been conducted in the unreclaimed provinces). The Benxihu Coal and Iron Company, etc., now retain only old machinery and dilapidated factory buildings. After the government took over, in terms of economy, special emphasis was placed on rebuilding the general economic order, regulating prices, striving to restore production, and stabilizing people's lives. The important work is described below:</p>
<p>A. Financial Aspect: The Central Bank issued circulation notes in the nine northeastern provinces and used them at the same value as puppet Manchukuo banknotes. However, before the issuance of the circulation notes, the National Army, in order to cope with various expenses, had affixed the seal of the Northeast Security Commander's Office to the legal currency it carried, commonly known as "stamped legal currency," and used it at the same value as the puppet Manchukuo banknotes. After the issuance of the circulation notes, the currency system began to be reorganized: (1) Reorganization of Soviet military tickets: The measures for the reorganization of Soviet military tickets were promulgated in August of the 35th year of the Republic, and the registration of Soviet military tickets began on September 9th, and all of them were cashed in. After September, the newly recovered valley areas re-established supplementary registration measures on October 15th, and the work of redemption is also being promoted with the advancement of the military. (2) Reorganization of puppet Manchukuo banknotes: The method of only accepting but not issuing was adopted. As of the end of December of the 35th year of the Republic, 4,645,329,460 yuan of puppet Manchukuo banknotes had been secretly recovered, accounting for approximately 34.3% of the total amount issued. Official statistics have not been obtained since the 36th year of the Republic. Except for those below 50 yuan, puppet Manchukuo banknotes have disappeared from the market, and circulation notes have become the only currency in general circulation in the Northeast. (3) Reorganization of "stamped legal currency": Most of it had been recovered by the end of January of the 36th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Regarding the opening of remittance, on the one hand, remittances were organized for government employees to support their families, and on the other hand, "Implementation Measures for Industrial and Commercial Remittances" were promulgated to benefit merchants and residents. The exchange rate between circulation notes and legal currency was initially 1:13, and then changed to 1:11.5 and 1:12.5. For the past year, prices in the Northeast have always been lower than those within the customs, which cannot but be attributed to the issuance of circulation notes and the proper management of exchange rates. The next is the management of the financial market, strictly prohibiting gold transactions. Since July of the 35th year of the Republic, the government has publicly announced the prohibition of gold and foreign exchange trading, inspecting gold shops and silver buildings on the one hand, and rewarding people for reporting black markets on the other hand, and it has disappeared. In addition, the government, such as supporting the development of industrial and mining enterprises, has organized a large number of industrial loans. The banks have overdrawn 2 billion yuan for the 19 state-owned industrial and mining production units established by the Resources Committee in the Northeast. For the support of small and medium-sized industries, the "Draft Measures for Joint Loans for Small and Medium-sized Industries by Commercial Banks" has been promulgated, and the loaned factories and mines have benefited greatly.

Mr. Wedemeyer continued to meet with Yu Xinqing, chairman of the Design Committee of the Baoding Pacification Office, and Bishop Tian Linji, Dr. Lux, representative of the Luo's China Aid Fund, and Rigney, dean of studies of Fu Jen Catholic University. At the same time, Gan Jiehou, Liu Hangchen, and Pu Xinyu also had contact with the mission. According to Pu Xinyu, he told Mr. Wedemeyer that the compatriots in the Northeast absolutely support the central government and appreciate the United States' assistance to China. In addition, a large number of visitors who wished to submit information to the mission were received by Mr. Wedemeyer's advisors for a long time. At 6:00 p.m., Mr. Wedemeyer and U.S. Consul Freeman went to the Beixinqiao Presbyterian Church, where they were accompanied by Pastor Melvin and Dr. Feng Ji to visit the church and hospital for half an hour.

Mr. Wedemeyer and the members are scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow morning, then to Shenyang and Qingdao, and return to Nanjing on the weekend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] He Siyuan, Mayor of Peiping, issued a statement on the 3rd regarding the Wedemeyer special mission's visit to North China, stating that China has reached a point where it must choose between democracy or communism. Those with knowledge naturally support democracy, because communism is not suitable for China. When China asks for American assistance, it is not asking the United States to directly suppress the communists. However, for the sake of the people's interests, we must eliminate communism, which contains international complexities. We tried to eliminate the communists before the war, but now we are forced to do so. Mayor He also emphasized that there is no real anti-American sentiment in China. The people are very grateful for the supplies of the UNRRA, and they understand that they come from the United States. He also pointed out that China needs sound administration and admits that it has made some mistakes and cannot make the country move towards the ideal authentic democracy.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits in Western Shandong are Rats in a Sack, Remnants Near Linpu Gathering for Annihilation, Sweep in Pingbao Area Expected to Have New Developments</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] Remnants of the 1st and 7th columns of Liu Bocheng's communist bandit troops and independent brigades were captured by the National Army southeast of Linpu and are being annihilated. The National Army is dividing into multiple routes to encircle and suppress the remnants of the bandits in the northwest and southwest areas of Ningyang. The remaining communist bandits in western Shandong have become rats in a sack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng attempted to obstruct the government's restoration of the Yellow River levee. He concentrated the remnants of his 1673rd column and launched a fierce attack on the National Army's river defense and levee restoration troops in Linpu on the 2nd. The National Army fought bravely to block the attack and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 3rd] After Chen Yi's 8th and 10th columns merged with the 1st and 2nd columns and the 13th Division in the triangular area of Jining, Dongping, and Dakou, the former, starting on the 1st, attempted to flee eastward across the Jinpu Line via Xiteng Village Store, Ge Shizhuang, southwest of Nanyi. The latter fled to the outskirts of Yanzhou via Nanji Set (southeast of Jining) and Hongmiao (east of Ershilipu) on the 1st. The National Army's pursuit forces are continuing to encircle and suppress them. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's five columns, including the 6th column, are still surrounded by the National Army in Wenshangji, north of Chengwu. The 3rd column is in Dushanj, south of Juye, and the 7th column is in Tangchakou, near Jinxiang. As for the 3rd and 2nd columns, they fled to Linu Kou and Linpu on the 1st to prevent the National Army's levee restoration project, and fierce fighting broke out again.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 3rd] The four-corner area of ​​Ningyang, Nanyi, Jining, and Yanzhou is the scene of fierce fighting, and the Xuzhou-Zhacun section of the Jinpu Road has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] The National Army in Linqu continued to sweep outwards on the 2nd. The pursuit force on the southern route has crossed Xinzai and approached Jiangyu.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The bandits who collapsed from Linqu in three routes, in addition to the more than two columns to Gaoai, Jiangyu, Liushanzhai in the southeast of the city and the Zhuquan in the northwest, and the main force of more than four columns who collapsed to Yidu, had already fled north across the Jiaoji Line on the 1st, and the National Army is continuing to pursue and suppress them. The vanguard has reached the vicinity of Yidu two days ago.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Baoding, 3rd] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Line is redeploying its forces. The Hebei China National Army is being transferred north to the periphery of Baoding. Currently, the National Army has divided and transferred its forces from Qingfengdian to Dongchangshou on the Baoshi section. It is generally predicted that the National Army in the west of Baoding and the triangular area of ​​Ping, Jin, and Bao will launch another encirclement and suppression campaign against the bandits. In addition, the National Army in the northern section of the Jinpu Line continued to cross Yaoguantun southwards. Thousands of bandits in the suburbs of Cangxian resisted fiercely.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 3rd] The front line in the northern section of Jinpu is quiet, and there will be no major changes within the day. Currently, the National Army is engaged in the consolidation work in Jin County and Jinghai.

<h3>Communist Bandits Plot to Dig the Yellow River Banks, Army Headquarters Lists Ironclad Evidence, People Launch Movement to Defend Their Hometowns and Save the Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Wu Yizhou, director of the Press Office of the Xuzhou Command of the Army Headquarters, recently made a statement on the communist bandits' preparation to dig the levee between Jiucheng and Xunko as follows: After the communist bandits Liu Bocheng led his troops, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns, to cross the Yellow River and disturb western Shandong, they suffered severe blows from the National Army and strong resistance from the people in various places. They were repeatedly defeated and suffered heavy casualties. In order to save their fate of being completely eliminated and to cover up the shame of their defeat, they are actively deploying to dig the levee, attempting to inundate the south bank. However, in order to shirk responsibility for this crime, they spread propaganda in advance, falsely claiming that the National Army planned to dig the levee and breach it. For example, on July 29, the communist bandits' Handan Broadcasting Station broadcasted that when Liu's bandits were preparing to breach the levee in the Haozhai area west of Dongming, they instead claimed that it was done by the National Army's 558th Regiment. Their intention to reverse right and wrong and deceive the people is obvious. Their obstruction of the government's levee repair and river protection project is even more numerous. For example, in the upper part of July, liaison personnel working between Wuzhi and Juancheng and Puyang were shelled by the bandits on the north bank and had to withdraw to Kaifeng. On July 31, the communist bandits' Handan Broadcasting Station broadcasted a statement in mid-July by the pseudo-Jinji Luyu Liberated Area Democratic Government, saying: "Our side (the bandits' self-proclaimed) has entered a state of total military mobilization. We hope that liaison personnel will no longer come to the liberated area, otherwise they will not be protected." It also broadcasted news that "the Zhu Kou Engineering Third Team of the Shandong Flood Prevention Office of the government has been completely oppressed by us and retreated to the vicinity of Gaocun and Maodian, and the engineering materials stored by the team have been completely robbed back to the north bank of the Yellow River," etc. All of these are ironclad evidence of the communist bandits obstructing the government's levee restoration project. Currently, it is the season of great flooding, the water level is rising sharply, and the levees everywhere are in danger. Our repair personnel are rushing to work day and night to protect the levees, but Liu's bandits do not care about the hundreds of millions of people on the south bank. They have gathered the 1st, 6th, and 7th columns to encircle and attack our levee restoration troops stationed in Linpu and attack and rob repair workers everywhere. At the same time, they have dug three channels to draw the river in the area between Jiucheng and Dongkou, preparing to breach the levee. Now the people of Caoshu counties in southwestern Shandong have abandoned their land and thoroughly recognized the crimes of the communist bandits, and have risen up in rebellion one after another, launching a movement to resist the communist bandits and defend their hometowns and save the country.</p>
<h3>Downstream Water Level of the Yellow River Rises, Jinan Laborers Go Up the Levee to Guard</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] The Yellow River's flood season has arrived, and the downstream river water has suddenly increased.

According to statistics, the average annual rainfall in Nanning in the past five years is only over 1,200 centimeters, while the rainfall in June of this year was 536 centimeters.

Moreover, the flood occurred at a time when a bumper harvest was expected, and all the crops were washed away by the flood. Mr. Zheng is scheduled to return to the capital on the 4th to report.</p>
<h3>Jin Experiencing Summer Autumn Weather</h3>

<h3>Narcotics Smuggled South from Communist Bandit Area in Songbei</h3>
<p>Changchun Authorities Issue Strict Prevention Orders</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The first batch of "Little White Flower" opium north of the Songhua River has now matured and is being escorted by communist bandits to southern Songhua for sale. In several bandit dens on both sides of southern Songhua, the communist bandits have set up opium exchanges to seize materials and circulation notes from the government's territory with narcotics. It is estimated that one bolt of cotton cloth or one bundle of cotton can be exchanged for three to four taels of opium. The military and police here have paid close attention to this. In addition to ordering the troops stationed in southern Songhua to strictly prevent the transportation of narcotics from the bandit area to the south, they have also launched a drug eradication campaign among the military and civilians in the city.</p>

Citizens lined the streets to watch, and the whole city was stirred up. Due to the communist army's guerrilla warfare, it was rare for large numbers to be captured in the past. The large number of prisoners this time proves the heavy blows suffered by the communist army. Among this batch of prisoners, there are many important communist bandit cadres, and the military department will conduct detailed interrogations.</p>

<h3>Northeast Facing New Crisis The Above Article Continues from the First Page</h3>
<p>B. Industry and Mining: The government's reorganization of heavy industry, centered on the Resources Committee, particularly emphasizes the resumption and increased production of coal and electricity. Major mines resuming operation include Fuxin, Fushun, Xi'an, Beipiao, Benxi Lake, Yantai, Yingchengzi, etc. Although small mines in other areas are managed by responsible authorities, their output is minimal, only sufficient to meet local needs. The output of major mines is also limited, due to equipment damage and insufficient raw material and power supply, reaching only one-fourth to one-tenth of the output during the puppet Manchukuo period. The total output in October of the 35th year was 360,000 metric tons, and the total output for the entire 35th year was 1.6 million tons. Power generation enterprises with larger scales include Jilin (hydropower), Fushun, Xi'an, and Beipiao (thermal power). In the past, the power generation capacity was 2.5 million kilowatts, but the current power generation is only one-fifth of the past. The power generated by other power plants in Anshan and Benxi Lake is mostly used for local mining needs. In addition to coal and electricity, industries such as iron and steel manufacturing, non-ferrous metal industry, machinery industry, electrical appliance industry, chemical industry, kerosene industry, and cement industry have either resumed production and increased output, or are urgently planning for restoration. The progress of their work has not stopped for a single day.</p>
<p>The government's reorganization of light industry is centered on the Production Management Bureau. The bureau has taken over more than 1,000 factory units, but due to restrictions on raw materials, transportation, technology, and other conditions, it has not been able to fully restore operations. As of recently, only 59 factories have resumed operation. The bureau will divide the newly received factories into three categories: for auction, for lease, and for joint operation, and will do its best to transfer them to private operation. They are currently being processed one after another.</p>
<p>C. Trade: On August 16 of the 35th year, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters announced the "Provisional Measures for the Adjustment of Commodity Imports and Exports" and the "Provisional Measures for Railway Whole-Vehicle Freight Transportation," classifying exports into three categories: ordinary exports, licensed exports, and specially licensed exports, while imports were not restricted. Later, the export of metals and steel in the licensed export materials was stipulated to be barter trade, in order to adjust the supply of materials inside and outside the customs. In addition, in order to prevent merchants from obtaining excessive profits, when exporting commodities with excessive price differences inside and outside the customs, it was stipulated that a "profit-balancing fund" should be levied in addition to legal profits. The law was well-intentioned, but unfortunately, the power of the implementing agency could not be concentrated, the economic inspection could not exert efficiency, and the staff of the Railway Bureau committed fraud and smuggled goods, so the trend of smuggling was very rampant, so those who played with the law could take advantage of it, and those who followed the rules could not survive. The trade situation fell into a state of monopoly, which is regrettable. Regarding the quantity of import and export materials, according to the announcement of the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee, the total value of goods leaving the customs from June to December of the 35th year was more than 12.8 billion yuan, and the total value of goods entering the customs was more than 10.6 billion yuan, with a surplus of 2.2 billion yuan. Most of the goods leaving the customs were manufactured products, which were close to consumables, and most of the goods entering the customs were food and raw materials. The main exports were cigarettes, cotton cloth, and gasoline, and their prices far exceeded several times the value of the same amount of goods entering the customs. From this observation, the current foreign trade in the Northeast is quite unreasonable. We believe that the Northeast must establish an overall economic construction plan, promote industrial production, and implement planned trade, so that the future can be optimistic.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about his expectations for the future development of the Northeast, he replied with an extremely optimistic mood: The Northeast is not only the lifeline of the people of the Northeast, but also the nutrient storehouse of all Chinese people. For the past fourteen years, it has been occupied by the enemy, and although it has been arbitrarily exploited and looted, and the essence has been robbed, since the victory, the Soviet army first stationed illegal armed forces to sneak in, and important materials and equipment were moved and looted, which we feel very sad. However, with the rich natural resources here, which can still be developed, and the damaged factories and mines, which can still be restored, it is not difficult to restore the old appearance of the puppet Manchukuo era after ten years of recuperation. However, the prerequisite that must be resolved is that the Northeast must be fully taken over, and the Communist bandits' power must not be allowed to develop in this way for a long time. As long as the Communist bandits in the Northeast exist, all economic construction will be out of the question. We have not yet made a hasty judgment on whether there is external manipulation behind the Communist bandits in the Northeast, but if Lushun and Dalian cannot be quickly taken over, it is inevitable that external forces will gradually intervene. Judging from the current situation in the Northeast, we cannot avoid our new fear, and we have the right to demand that all peace-loving and righteous people in the world jointly eliminate this kind of latent new crisis. The Northeast has now been restored from the iron hooves of the Japanese imperialists, and we will not allow any foreign forces to exist again. Not only that, but we also hope that the peace conference with Japan can be convened as soon as possible, and that it will be held in Shenyang, and that all the economic losses suffered by the Northeast in the past fourteen years will be compensated by Japan in full. At the same time, after Japan surrendered, before our government took over, we also hope that the Allied Reparations Committee will consider the accidental losses suffered by the Northeast, whether in the financial or economic sectors, and discuss a reasonable and practical compensation plan. As for the future path of economic development in the Northeast, he believes that the first thing to do is to reorganize and restore the inherent industrial and mining enterprises, strive to increase production and self-sufficiency, reduce imports and increase exports, and that the currency system in the Northeast should be kept unified with the national currency system, and it should not be that the nine provinces circulation coupons exist for a long time. Finally, he said: We welcome General Wedemeyer to the Northeast with extremely warm emotions, and hope that Mr. Wei can use the factual data obtained from this trip to help solve the Northeast problem, and that spiritual assistance will be even more important than material assistance.

<h3>Tragic Case of American Soldiers in Beijing Pushing People into the Water, the Culprit Was Interrogated Several Times Yesterday, the Ambassador Instructed Brooks to Punish According to the Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch on the 3rd] Regarding the tragic case of an American soldier pushing our Air Force soldier into the water outside Guanghua Gate and drowning him, Ambassador Stuart read about it in the newspaper on the morning of the 3rd and immediately summoned Major General Brooks, the head of the US Military Advisory Group, to inquire about the details, instructing him to investigate the facts and punish him severely according to the law.

The US Military Advisory Group is also dealing with this matter as soon as possible. Although the 3rd was a holiday, the criminals who were identified by our military police Cheng Chaozong and detained by the US side were still interrogated several times. However, for the sake of prudence, there was no report to the outside world. At 5:00 p.m., Brooks accompanied the captain of the military police to visit the ambassador again to report. The two deceased were both only sons, and their parents were extremely sad. They deeply hoped that the case would be resolved reasonably as soon as possible, that condolences would be given quickly, that the wicked would be severely punished, and that resentment would be pacified early.</p>

Adore was arrested at 2:30 p.m. on the 2nd, but was granted two hours of parole to marry Corporal Russell of the Women's Auxiliary Corps. It is said that the highest penalty for the culprit in this case will be five to thousands of years in prison.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Tainan Dispatch on the 3rd] Budai, Huwei, Beigang, Xiluo, Xinhua, and other places in western Tainan County are the main production areas of salt, rice, and fish in Taiwan Province, and transportation between them is mainly by road. There is an unfinished highway bridge between Xiluo and Beidou, which is the first highway bridge in the Far East, with a length of 1,941 meters. In the past, only a part of its bridge foundation was completed during the Japanese era. After the restoration, the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office appreciated the importance of the bridge and specially hired engineering expert Wan Dongzi to design it in order to continue construction. It is now heard that the Taiwan Provincial Government also has this plan. According to Wan, if the bridge is constructed of steel, the total project cost will be at least NT$2 billion. However, if a cement bridge is built, it is estimated to cost NT$1.3 billion and take three years to complete. It is estimated to cost NT$1.3 billion and take three years to complete. This bridge is not only regarded as the longest highway bridge in the Far East, but its value is even greater in shortening the distance between the main production areas in Tainan County, facilitating transportation, and developing the agricultural economy.</p>
<h3>The International Military Tribunal for the Far East Has Ended Its Recess, Mei Ruao Flew to Tokyo Today, the Tokyo Trial Will Enter an Important Stage</h3>
<p>[This City Dispatch] The six-week recess of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East has ended, and the trial will resume this week. Dr. Mei Ruao, the judge representing our country in the tribunal, will fly directly to Tokyo by American plane at 7:00 a.m. today (the 4th). The reporter visited Mr. Mei at his residence on the 3rd and asked about the future progress and trend of the Tokyo trial. According to Mr. Mei, when the International Military Tribunal for the Far East resumes this week, the defendants will continue their joint defense and presentation of evidence to complete the unfinished part of the "joint defense," which is the part about Japan launching the Pacific War. The defendants' defense lawyers will present all favorable evidence to prove that before the war was launched, countries such as the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands had completed the economic, diplomatic, and military encirclement of Japan. This is the last program in the joint defense of all defendants, and it is expected to be completed in about three or four weeks. Following this will be the individual defense of the defendant war criminals. This is an important and exciting stage of the Tokyo trial, because at that time, not only will each defendant have to take the stand to defend himself in person, but he can also present as many witnesses and evidence as possible that are particularly favorable to him. We have stipulated that each defendant is limited to taking the stand only once, but the court has not stipulated the time for each defendant to provide evidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 3rd] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East will resume tomorrow after a six-week recess. Takahashi, the defense lawyer for 25 major war criminals, will read a written statement on the Pacific War phase. During the recess, the defendants' Japanese and American defense lawyers have been busy preparing documents. The President of the Tribunal, Webb, has asked the defendants' defense lawyers to complete the trial procedures as soon as possible so that the trial can be concluded by the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Higher Education Should Be Developed Universally</h3>
<p>According to reports, there are currently as many as 69 colleges and universities across the country that have requested to change their systems or relocate. Why do they want to make requests for relocation? Are their requirements reasonable?</p>
<p>"The national higher education should be developed universally according to the region," which was decided by the Education Rehabilitation Conference convened by the Ministry of Education in November of the year before last. At that time, it was believed that education "rehabilitation" was not "restoration," and that national higher education institutions should be distributed in a planned manner, so as not to concentrate in big cities and develop in a deformed way. After this decision, many colleges, independent colleges, and universities were designated to be located in relatively remote locations to shoulder the arduous mission of developing inland culture.</p>
<p>This educational policy is theoretically correct. National higher education institutions should never be concentrated in several cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin. But what is the fact? What is the situation of inland universities after rehabilitation? Can they shoulder the solemn mission of making higher education universally developed nationwide? Why are they asking to relocate one after another? This is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The basic conditions for the success of the education undertaking are teachers and equipment. Inland higher education institutions lack these basic conditions for success, and the hardship is thousands of times more serious than that of schools in cities. University equipment is simple and lacks good teachers, so it cannot satisfy students' desire for knowledge. As a result, waves of disturbances arise, requiring relocation. School administrators cannot handle it and finally resign one after another. School administration loses its center of gravity, and the Ministry of Education also has difficulty coping with it.</p>
<p>Why are many university professors unwilling to teach in the interior? Summarizing the reasons, there are six points: First, the salary is too low, there are no positions to hold concurrently in the interior, and they cannot engage in other businesses to maintain their lives; second, the transportation is inconvenient, the travel expenses are high, and they are often prone to accidental disasters; third, the library and equipment are poor, and it is not easy to add them, and research tools are lacking; fourth, the medical equipment is incomplete, and life is not guaranteed; fifth, there are fewer good primary and secondary schools, and children's schooling is a problem; sixth, there is less contact between individuals and other people from all walks of life, and development is difficult. With these six reasons, the phenomenon of an oversupply of teachers in Beijing and Shanghai and a shortage of teachers in the interior has been created. University professors are free professions. For the sake of life safety, economic solutions, knowledge advancement, children's education, and basic material life requirements (such as electricity and tap water), you have no reason or ability to force them to go to the interior. Therefore, the professors hired by the Ministry of Education are also concentrated in cities. Check the requests for relocation from universities or colleges in the interior, and none of them fail to mention the inconvenience of transportation and the difficulty of hiring professors as reasons. If a university lacks good professors and equipment, it is equivalent to losing its soul. In this case, how can we talk about improving students' level? How can we talk about cultivating a spirit of research? How can we talk about developing inland culture? How can we talk about academics? Coupled with the unstable factors of politics and economy, the situation of higher education in the interior is declining.</p>
<p>The education undertaking must seek progress in stability. Excellent teachers, perfect equipment, satisfying students' desire for knowledge, and guiding them to the path of academic research to explore the truth are urgent tasks today. Forsaking this and seeking school stability and academic development are all abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, and laboring without success.</p>
<p>Our country's higher education must not only seek development in big cities, but must go deep into the interior. We are willing to support the proposition of seeking the average development of national higher education in various places, but this is not something that can be done by empty words. It must be accompanied by practical measures. The primary plan is how to enable inland universities to hire excellent professors and enrich their equipment. These are all responsibilities that the education administrative authorities cannot shirk. The construction costs, equipment costs, administrative costs, etc. of universities, independent colleges, and colleges in the interior (including teachers' travel expenses) should all be subject to special preferential single-line laws, aiming at the six reasons mentioned above why university professors are unwilling to serve in the interior, so as to gradually solve them. Universities in big cities should be enriched and developed, and universities in the interior should be enriched and developed. The viewpoint of educational administration should make the latter more important than the former, and change the past style of universities in big cities getting the first opportunity to obtain funding. Only in this way can universities in the rear absorb talents and enrich equipment; only in this way can national higher education be developed universally. Otherwise, the calls for relocation from various inland schools today will not be expected to stop, and this problem may not be reasonably resolved.</p>
<h3>Reforming Local Politics</h3>
<p>Following the National Food Conference, the Executive Yuan took advantage of the presence of provincial governors in the capital to hold four administrative symposiums. These gatherings brought together the provincial governors and heads of various central government ministries to allow the provincial governors to explain the practical difficulties of local administration and their demands from the central government. The central government, on the other hand, reviewed and instructed on the opinions presented by the provincial governors, and put forward its hopes for the local governments. The aim was to foster mutual understanding between the central and local levels, thereby jointly striving to implement current national policies. The administrative symposium concluded successfully yesterday. According to reports from this newspaper's correspondent in the capital, the main issues discussed at the symposium were as follows: (1) How can provincial politics be coordinated with constitutionalism during the period of constitutional preparation? (2) After the promulgation of the general mobilization order, how can the mobilization of local manpower, financial resources, and materials be coordinated with military affairs? (3) How to ensure local public security and order? (4) How to rationally adjust local administrative and financial institutions?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned issues are indeed very serious at present. If these issues cannot be reasonably resolved, then all plans for reforming politics will be out of the question. However, this administrative symposium only exchanged opinions between the central and local governments and did not make concrete decisions. Therefore, we must still appeal to the central government to pay close attention to the reform of local administration. According to a telegram from this newspaper's Nanjing office on the 2nd, supervisory committee members Yu Shude and 42 others jointly proposed a "Sixteen Points for Urgent Implementation of Political Reform" proposal. It is reported that the content is divided into two major parts: politics and economics. It also puts forward some opinions on reforming local politics, the most noteworthy of which are: (1) Implementing civilian rule over the military and civilians, and local officials must not be held by military personnel; (2) Local officials must not hold concurrent positions, and a one-person-one-job system must be strictly implemented; (3) Dividing the powers of the central and local governments, and abolishing special local systems; (4) Reducing and merging redundant institutions, improving and standardizing the treatment of public and teaching staff. We hope that the government authorities should not only pay special attention to this proposal for political reform, but also do everything possible to ensure that it is effectively implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The separation of military and civilian affairs should no longer be an issue in China in theory. However, in the early days of the Japanese surrender, the administration of various provinces was primarily focused on surrender acceptance, reception, and demobilization. Therefore, the governors of various provinces had to be held by military personnel. Later, the communist bandits rebelled, putting some provinces under military control. In order to ensure the security of the area, it was still appropriate for military personnel to serve as local leaders. Therefore, up to now, most of the governors of various provinces are held by military personnel. However, this transitional approach should not be allowed to exist for a long time. Provinces that are no longer threatened by the communist bandits should first implement the separation of military and civilian affairs, so that local politics can get on the right track as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If we observe "the affairs of the people"—politics—with the simplest perspective, it is not difficult to reach a conclusion: that which is most closely related to people's daily lives is local politics. The quality of local politics is enough to directly affect the people's attitude towards the government. If the government authorities want to talk about reforming politics today, they must start with reforming local politics. Otherwise, any good plans and methods will inevitably be empty talk and cannot be realized.</p>
<p>At present, the provinces are preparing for a general election. This is the first general election in our country after the National Assembly passed the new constitution, and it is also the first step for our country's politics to move towards democratization. Whether the first step is taken well will affect the future of our country's democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, before the general election is held, we advocate that a reform movement should be launched in the politics of various provinces first, so as to ensure that the general election in various provinces can proceed smoothly within the normal track of constitutionalism!</p>

<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Radio Yogyakarta broadcast a declaration from the Indonesian Republic government, stating that it fully agrees with the UN Security Council's proposal for a ceasefire between Indonesia and the Netherlands. However, the Republic government requires that both sides withdraw their troops to the demarcation line determined in October 1946 as a condition.

<h3>Burmese Cabinet Reorganized</h3>
<p>More Arrests Continue in Assassination Case</p>

<h3>Bidault Declares That Policy on the Ruhr Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Foreign Minister Bidault said yesterday that "France will do its best to develop the Ruhr under European control for the use of Europe, including Germany," which does not indicate that France's policy on the Ruhr will change. Bidault's remarks are not only insufficient to indicate a softening of France's attitude on the Ruhr issue, but also a reaffirmation of France's policy on the Ruhr. The French government has never insisted that Germany should not benefit from the Ruhr with other parts of Europe. What France values is that Germany cannot control the production of the Ruhr. This is why Bidault declared "under European control."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bidault stated during a debate on the Foreign Ministry's budget in the French Parliament that France must strive to develop the Ruhr to serve the entire Europe rather than Germany alone, otherwise Germany will once again become a great harm to Europe.</p>
<h3>Serious British Economic Crisis; Government Will Likely Take Emergency Measures; Douglas Will Meet Clayton to Submit Report</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Authoritative sources believe that the British economic crisis has reached its most critical stage and cannot wait for assistance under the Marshall Plan to be obtained. Therefore, it is expected that the statement to be made by the British government in the House of Commons on Wednesday will be the most critical and serious indication since the declaration of war in 1939. US Ambassador Douglas is scheduled to fly from London to Paris today to meet with US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton to discuss the British government's view that the United States has not fully understood the urgency of the British economic crisis. He will inform him that the crisis of British dollar reserves will turn into a crisis of the British pound within weeks, threatening the stability of the British currency system.</p>
<p>According to recent authoritative estimates, the loans Britain has borrowed from the United States will be exhausted by the end of September. Even with measures such as reducing imports, they will inevitably be exhausted by mid-October at the latest. It is generally recognized that assistance under the Marshall Plan, even if it becomes a reality next spring, is already too late for Britain. Although the British government has not formally requested the United States to provide transitional assistance before the Marshall Plan is implemented, it is known that when Clayton was first in London, the British government explained the urgency of Britain's economic needs to him. However, a month has passed since then, and the United States has not yet made any indication, while Britain has only $1 billion remaining in loans from the United States. Under unavoidable circumstances, it will inform the United States that it will not be able to sign a multilateral trade agreement with discriminatory import provisions.</p>
<p>Predicted Contents of Emergency Measures</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] A reporter for the "Sunday Express" expects that the economic crisis rescue plan to be announced by Prime Minister Attlee in the House of Commons on Wednesday will include measures such as restricting imports to those necessary for life and export industries, levying a 2.5 percent capital tax, generally controlling prices, and extending working hours. He listed the emergency measures to be proposed by the Prime Minister, which will include the following: (1) Levying a capital tax, or adopting a compulsory savings method, forcing a deduction of 2.5 percent of wages, which will be returned with interest in the future; (2) Restricting imports to those necessary for daily life and export industries; (3) Expanding price controls; (4) Increasing working hours, or ordering workers to engage in one extra day of work per week; (5) Concentrating raw materials for export industries, and industries unrelated to exports or non-essential industries will be forced to close, making their workers participate in export industries; (6) Reducing military personnel, and British troops stationed in Greece, Italy, and most of the British troops stationed in Germany may be withdrawn; (7) Restricting spending on overseas vacations; (8) Investigating those engaged in the black market and those who evade work. In addition, reducing the value of clothing ration coupons, stopping the rationing of gasoline for non-essential uses, and implementing a ration coupon system in restaurants are all possible measures to be taken.</p>

<h3>US to Test Atomic Bomb; Power Against the Panama Canal</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] It is reported that the United States is conducting a secret test to find out the impact of an atomic bomb attack on the Panama Canal. This news was revealed in the report of the House Committee that inspected the Panama Canal this spring in March and has been confirmed by a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Commission. It is reported that the committee recommended spending $2.1 billion to improve the canal to ensure that it would not be damaged if directly hit by a large bomb, but it cannot withstand an atomic bomb. The report pointed out that the waterway of the Panama Canal is 85 feet above the waterline, so the atomic bomb will be able to drain the highlands lake, causing the canal to be unusable for two or three years. The cost of the canal's live gates is valued at $2.8 billion. The report did not reveal the details of the canal atomic test, but it is widely believed that the test will use TNT explosives to destroy the model of the sluice gate. The amount of TNT explosives is the same as the size of the sluice gate and the ratio of the atomic bomb to the Panama Canal.</p>
<h3>US Representative to the UN Accuses Soviets of Deliberate Delay</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] US Representative to the UN Military Staff Committee General McNarney recently gave a radio speech, accusing the Soviet Union of delaying the establishment of UN military forces. He said: "There has been no result from the discussion of 41 agenda items for a year. Of these, 25 have been agreed upon by our people, and 16 have not been agreed upon. The Soviet Union's opinions on these 16 items are not the same as those of the other 11 countries."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Soviet representative to the Atomic Energy Commission Osipian attacked the Soviet representatives, saying: "They are obstructing all negotiations on world atomic energy control. Their actions seem to be unaware of the new and terrible nature of atomic weapons." The US representative also said: Atomic negotiations are almost completely deadlocked between the Soviet Union and other countries.</p>

<h3>Electricity Generation and Distribution Companies Nationalized; British Parliament Passes Bill; Scheduled to be Implemented on New Year's Day Next Year</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] The British Labor government has completed another major action in its nationalization plan, namely taking over electricity generation and distribution companies. The bill passed by Parliament stipulates the takeover of 190 private companies, estimated to cost $1.4 billion, and is scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. In addition to electricity, the Labor government has now nationalized coal mines, the Bank of England, inland transportation, civil aviation, and overseas communications. The steel and gas industries will also have to be nationalized within the next three years in order to achieve its goal of 20 percent of national enterprises being nationalized and 80 percent being privately owned. If there are other plans in the future, they will also be included in the Socialist Party's platform for the next election.</p>
<h3>US Actively Researching Construction of Underground Aircraft Factories</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of the Army Royal recently revealed in his report on his activities during his tenure as Secretary of the Army that Army engineers plan to build an underground aircraft factory to test whether the factory is safe under the attack of atomic bombs or other new types of bombs. The Army Air Corps is also studying plans related to manufacturing precision aircraft parts in underground factories. Based on the results of this research, the Army plans to obtain funding in fiscal year 1948 and order the Chief of Engineers to build an underground aircraft factory for the above-mentioned project. He said: The underground defense plan also includes the establishment of a chemical plant and a fireproof instrument factory.</p>

<h3>Close Political and Economic Cooperation; Southern Bulgaria Signs Agreement; Another Concrete Step Against the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 2nd] The Yugoslav government announced on the 2nd that Southern Bulgaria has established several extensive agreements, including a customs union, abolition of passports, diplomatic cooperation, and a unified action against Greece, with seven main points.

<h3>Reasons for the Decline in US Export Trade in June</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The government released statistics: the total value of US export trade in June was 1.24 billion US dollars, a decrease of 13% compared to May, i.e., 180 million US dollars. This is the first major setback in US foreign trade, and some foreign trade experts unofficially regard it as a turning point in the decline of US foreign trade. Analyses of the reasons for the export decline include: (1) rapid depletion of foreign gold and US dollar assets; (2) foreign countries reducing purchases to maintain their declining purchasing power. Possible impacts of the export decline are as follows: (1) Commerce and employment will be disrupted, but the cessation of foreign competition in purchasing American goods may partially remedy US inflation. (2) As US imports decrease, foreign inflation will worsen, and the economic crisis will intensify political turmoil.</p>
<h3>Italian President Signs Instrument of Ratification of Peace Treaty; Exchange of Diplomatic Letters between US and Italy Announced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] Italian President Nicola signed the ratification of the Italian Peace Treaty today. The treaty will take effect after the Soviet Union formally ratifies it, following Britain, France, and the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall encouraged Italy today to find ways to revise the Italian Peace Treaty, secretly guaranteeing US support. Marshall's action is in line with US policy, which emphasizes Italy's anti-communism, quickly recognizing it as a fully independent nation, and increasing its importance in European politics.</p>
<p>[International News Service, Washington, 2nd] The US State Department announced on the 2nd the exchange of letters between Secretary of State Marshall and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. In Marshall's letter to Sforza, he stated that the Italian government's ratification of the treaty could remove the last obstacles built by fascism between Italy and other countries. He also urged the Italian government to revise the treaty's items opposed by the United States, but did not specify which items. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza replied that the Italian people are very willing to satisfy the hopes of the United States through the United Nations or treaties between the two countries.</p>
<h3>The Declining Trend of Communist Parties in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Office</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Communist parties in various countries around the world are gradually losing power. Some countries are rejecting communist parties in order to acquire US dollars. Some countries are trying to restore their unity and revive themselves by removing communist parties.</p>
<p>However, this trend may be temporary. Most governments hoping to obtain US dollars have not yet succeeded. Communist parties may make a comeback. In several countries, communist parties have considerable power, and governments cannot stand firm without their support.</p>
<p>The US State Department is currently conducting an investigation to determine the impact of US policy on the struggle between communist and non-communist parties around the world. The results of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Since President Truman announced the loan plan for Greece and Turkey on March 12th, to strengthen their ability to resist communism and Soviet pressure, the decline of communist party power in various countries has become even more pronounced.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is extremely concerned about the decline of communist party power in various countries. Moscow often accuses the United States of supporting reactionaries and "encouraging fascism." However, liberals in most countries have benefited from this US action, while communist parties have suffered.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>The French Communist Party has now left the government because, although they verbally supported the cabinet's wage freeze policy, they actually attempted to support strikers in demanding wages, and were therefore removed from the cabinet.</p>
<p>The French Communist Party is also gradually losing power in trade unions. This spring, they hoped to gain control of the social security system through the election of national workers, but the vote count resulted in failure due to insufficient votes. Now, the Socialist Party and other non-communist parties are challenging the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor, France's largest labor organization.</p>
<p>One of the most vocal opponents of the French Communist Party is General de Gaulle, the wartime leader of Free France. Encouraged by the US Mediterranean policy, de Gaulle established an anti-communist movement organization with a claimed membership of one million. His efforts accelerated the Communist Party's separation.</p>
<p>The non-communist government of France is currently seeking aid from the United States. France needs to import 2 billion tons of wheat before August 1948 and needs 1 billion US dollars for construction. French Communist Party leader Duclos is now relying on the party's influence in French labor to prevent France's views on seeking US dollars from diverging too far from the Communist Party.</p>
<p>To please the French people, the French Communist Party is trying to stop strikes and increase production. However, strikes still occur from time to time. If the Communist Party does not stop but incites strikes, the French economy may collapse.</p>
<p>Northern Europe</p>
<p>In Northern Europe, the Soviet Union's northern neighbors are now excluding communist parties. A free election of Finnish workers has seized control of the National Trade Union Committee from the hands of the Communist Party. As a result, relations between Finland and the Soviet Union have become strained. Since February 1946, the total amount of US loans and credit loans obtained by Finland has exceeded 100 million US dollars. In addition, they need more US dollars to fund the 1948 import plan. However, Finland still does not dare to openly oppose the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>During the Danish general election in April of this year, the Communist Party received only 71,900 votes, which is incomparable to the 255,536 votes received in the 1945 national election. Denmark is now moving towards restoration and plans to borrow 50 million US dollars from the World Bank, but has not directly requested a loan from the United States.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>In recent elections in West Germany, the number of votes for the Communist Party suddenly plummeted. Only in North Rhine-Westphalia, a district in the British occupation zone, did the Communist Party receive 14% of the votes. In other districts, it only received 5% to 8% of the total votes.</p>
<p>Holy Land</p>
<p>The Arab Communist Party in Palestine has doubled its membership in a year, but recently, due to the Soviet Union's approval of the Palestine partition plan opposed by the Arabs, it has gradually lost its prestige. Most of the 20,000 workers in the Communist Party's trade union have gradually left the union. The Jewish Communist Party occupies only 3 seats out of 171 seats in the Jewish Parliament, and its power is still very weak.</p>
<p>Americas</p>
<p>Anti-communist sentiment in the Americas is expanding. Chilean President Videla, who was elected in 1946 with the support of the Communist Party, has excluded three communist ministers from his cabinet in order to obtain US economic assistance.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Communist Party received 500,000 votes in the last election and was recently ordered by the Electoral Court to be placed outside the protection of the law, accusing it of intentionally overthrowing the democratic government. The Brazilian economy is closely related to the United States, and the United States' recent policies towards the Soviet Union and the Communist Party have influenced Brazil's political trends.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>In Japan, the national general election held in April of this year almost halved the number of votes for the Communist Party compared to 1946. The Communist Party occupies only four seats out of 466 seats in the Lower House of Parliament, and none in the Upper House.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are relatively few countries where the Communist Party is gaining power.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>The Communist Party in Italy is quite powerful, setting up its own hospitals, schools, and secret police. In a state of widespread unemployment and famine, the Communist Party appeals to people as a "government for the poor," attracting many believers.</p>
<p>The United States has shipped more than 1 billion US dollars worth of relief supplies to Italy, and the Export-Import Bank is now considering Italy's 100 million US dollar loan request. However, the impact of the US dollars already given or promised to Italy on Italy's future is still very minimal. As a result, the Communist Party has increased its vote count in elections and controls most of the industrial areas.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe</p>
<p>In Berlin, within the Soviet occupation zone, the Communist Party has already controlled 500,000 workers through trade union elections. In Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, under Communist Party control, face little opposition. Non-communist parties in Hungary are gradually weakening under pressure from the Communist Party police. Poland, although subject to Communist Party control, is currently seeking a loan in US dollars from the United States.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the stalemate between communist and non-communist parties is deepening. The new equilibrium between the two may be the result of the current trend. The advantage currently gained by non-communist parties may not last forever, but there is little hope for the Communist Party to restore the number of election votes and prestige lost since the United States established a new policy in the Mediterranean.

<h3>German Factory in US Occupation Zone Secretly Stores War Equipment and Sells It to the Soviet Occupation Authorities; Soviet Side Issued Letter Proving the Need for Such Instruments</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 2nd] Personnel at the Askania factory in Berlin (the place where US military authorities discovered a large number of illegal war equipment yesterday) said: the equipment manufactured by the factory was equipped and transported to the factory branch in Teltow in the Soviet zone, and then resold to the Soviet occupation forces. According to the German news agency in the British zone, the executive and production council of Askania stated that after forty observation and surveying instruments were transported to the Teltow branch and resold to the Soviet occupation authorities, Soviet representatives issued a letter proving the need for these instruments. These instruments are suitable for various surveying and observation tasks and can be used for both military and civilian purposes. The manufacture of these instruments takes several months and are not newly made, but are assembled from existing parts. Not many have been sold since the end of the war. The Askania factory authorities also stated that the submarine periscopes found at the factory branch in the Mirindorf district of Berlin were found in a scrap metal pile. The US military helped to collect part of this scrap metal, and the support rods of the periscopes have been cut off for the manufacture of other items. Askania factory no longer has the machinery to manufacture new periscopes. According to the German news agency in the US zone, the instruments supplied by the Askania factory to the Soviet authorities are for measuring railways, and the Americans had already helped to conduct partial inspections. As for whether these instruments are used for other purposes, the factory cannot be held responsible. It is also learned that the production committee will announce on Monday a statement regarding the arrest of six executive heads of the factory and the US authorities' investigation of the matter.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Case in Puxi Demands Ransom of Hundreds of Millions; Rescue of Three Hostages by Directly Assaulting the Bandit Den; Confessions of Captured Criminals Reveal Complex Details; Bandit Leader Prepared to Expand the New Fourth Army after Receiving the Money</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] On the night of the 21st of last month, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred in Tiqiao Township, Puxi. A total of four people, men and women, were kidnapped. After the incident, the bandits secretly negotiated with the families of the kidnapped. Finally, an "agreement" was reached with 360 shi of white rice as the price for the ransom of the hostages. At the same time, for the convenience of the families of the victims, the bandits agreed to convert it at 350,000 yuan per shi, totaling 126 million legal tender. It was agreed that the money and the people would be exchanged at a general merchandise store next to the Huangjialu railway station outside the East Gate of Nanhui County on the afternoon of the 30th. As a result, the case was detected and solved by the Fifth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The sixth bao chief of Tiqiao Township, Wu Caifu, Zhou, the wife of Xu Jintao, a resident, and Zhu Cailin and his wife Chen, merchants, were kidnapped at the same time on the night of the 21st. Although the families of the victims remained tight-lipped at the time, the Fifth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Command had already heard the news and was conducting an investigation. Suddenly, it was heard that Zhu Cailin's wife had been released midway, and the bandits sent someone with a handwritten letter from Zhu Cailin to secretly negotiate the ransom. The brigade stepped up its investigation and learned that Zhu Cailin, who was kidnapped, was the township chief of the township during the enemy-puppet period, and that Xu Zhou was Xu Jintao's abandoned wife. It was believed that the case seemed to have other complex details, so they conducted an in-depth investigation based on the original clues and tried to approach the relatives of the kidnapped and monitor their movements. However, the families of the kidnapped were intimidated by the power of the bandits and feared being torn apart, so they did not dare to reveal any information, and only secretly carried out the ransom work. Therefore, the investigation work was quite difficult to start. Li Renzhang, the brigade commander, decided to take a side investigation and obtained definite clues from Zhu Cailin's brother, who was also his cousin, and proved that Zhu's wife had escaped and returned on July 23. The servant sent a letter and agreed on the location to contact the bandits, all of which were facts. Zhu's brother also said that the bandit leader was Xu Jintao, the husband of the victim Xu Zhou. Zhu's brother also said: He sent someone to the appointment as scheduled. The bandits initially bargained and demanded 700 shi of white rice as ransom. Because the number was too large and he was unable to afford it, he did not agree immediately. Led by Xu Jintao and others, he walked about half a mile and then took a small boat to a small village and met his brother Zhu Cailin (hostage) and personally negotiated the ransom of 320 shi of white rice. However, the bandits demanded an additional dozen quick-slow machine guns, saying that their "brigade" was newly established and did not have enough guns. He refused to buy them, and later decided to add 40 shi of rice, totaling 360 shi, and priced it at 35, totaling 126 million yuan for ransom. It was agreed that the money would be delivered at a general merchandise store next to the Huangjialu railway station outside the East Gate of Nanhui County on the afternoon of the 30th. At this point, the investigation work had reached a considerable maturity. Brigade Commander Li then reported the whole process to Director Tao Yishan, and Director Tao ordered him to ask Deputy Director Zhang, and planned to solve the case. After careful study, it was decided that the Fifth Brigade would join forces with the Eighth Brigade (Pudong) to destroy it when the money was delivered. On July 30, Action Section Chief Cai Xingke led cadres Tao Zujie and Gu Yufeng, together with the Eighth Inspection Brigade, disguised themselves and secretly investigated the address. Cai and others arrived at the destination before dawn. Cai first scouted the terrain, but waited all day without any movement. Cai and others originally planned to immediately surround and conduct a powerful search, but the environment there was complicated and there was no reliable internal line. If the search was unsuccessful, it would only startle the snakes and all the efforts would be in vain. So he lurked nearby and sent out scouts to inquire in many ways until the morning of the 31st before returning to the team. On the 1st of this month, summarizing the information obtained from all parties, it was learned that the payment was made on the 30th. Because the victim's family was afraid of being torn apart, it was sent secretly and did not reveal any trace to the team, so a good opportunity was lost. It was also learned that the money was paid in installments. There was a second batch scheduled to be collected by the bandits at No. 63 Lane, Jin Shenfu Road in this city at 3-4 pm on the 1st. He sent Section Chief Cai to lead Tao Zujie, Gu Yufeng, and volunteers Tang Hechang, Wu Tiemin, Chai Youqin, Wang Deshi, etc. to secretly investigate. At five o'clock, two suspicious people were seen echoing each other in the lane. Observing their behavior, it was determined that they were bandits. They launched a secret signal and started at the same time. Xu Jintao, the main criminal of the bizarre kidnapping case, and his accomplice Xu Achu, were all arrested. After interrogation, it was learned that the location of the hostages was the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall in Tongqiao, about six miles east of Dongjialu in Nanhui County. At 9 pm that night, Brigade Commander Li Renzhang personally led Cai Xingke and other large numbers of cadres, escorted the bandit Xu Achu, and went there again to join forces with the Eighth Brigade to arrest the remaining bandits and rescue the hostages. Then the Eighth Brigade dispatched three members including Wu Baohe, set off from Dongchang Road to Zhoupu at 12:00 midnight, and joined forces with the local self-defense team to take action. When they arrived near Tongqiao, it was already 2:30 before dawn on the 2nd. They passed Yemaodong (village name), and the road was narrow and only able to accommodate feet. Li and others groped forward under the moonlight. After walking another hundred steps, they suddenly saw a vast ocean blocking their way. They found a ferry and abandoned the land to board the boat and rushed straight to the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall to implement the encirclement. It turned out that all the bandits had moved elsewhere. They asked the old man guarding the ancestral hall, who replied that he was still there yesterday (meaning the 31st), but did not know where he went today. Under this circumstance, it was hopeless. He questioned Xu Achu again, and Xu knew that he could no longer hide it, and said that he might be hiding nearby. Brigade Commander Li supervised his subordinates to search around and set up sentry posts at key points and reached a glance in front of a house in Majiazhai, two people seemed to be guarding, trying to escape like rats. Brigade Commander Li hurriedly ordered his troops to move forward bravely. Guan Zujie took the lead and kicked down the bandit on guard. The quick-slow machine gun and hand grenade he was carrying had not been fired. Then the whole team arrived and captured the bandit Wu Longcai and Li Damei, the concubine of the bandit Ma Fulou, and Gu Wanyun, the concubine of the main criminal Xu Jintao. They seized one Mauser pistol, six bullets, one hand grenade, and millions of dollars in stolen money. They rescued Zhu Cailin and Xu Zhou, two hostages. There was also one hostage, Wu Caifu, and the bandit Ma Fulou, who escaped.</p>
<p>At this point, the interrogation began. Deputy Director Zhang Yangming of the Inspection Department, together with Brigade Commander Li Renzhang, Brigade Deputy Jiang Zongwei, etc., interrogated all night. The main criminal Xu Jinman confessed that he was 47 years old, from Nanhui, and married into the Zhou family. He lived with his wife in Tiqiao Township and had operated businesses such as cotton, rice, and aquatic products. He now runs a meat shop. In the 31st year, he met the nurse Gu Wanyun due to illness and took her as a concubine, secretly building a love nest at No. 68 Zhuxia Road, South City. Li Damei, the concubine of the bandit Ma Fulou, also lived in his home. Because he was robbed three times when he was a son-in-law in the Zhou family, he said that it was all related to Zhu Cailin, so he kidnapped Zhu this time for revenge. Also, because he had 20 mu of land in the Zhou family, after abandoning his original wife Zhou, Wu Caifu, the bao chief, prevented him from collecting rent by himself, so he held a grudge and kidnapped Wu, and planned to forcibly sell the 20 mu of land to Zhu and Wu. Therefore, he kidnapped his original wife to the scene to conduct the transaction. He also confessed to the planned kidnapping. He discussed it with the bandit Ma several times in early July. Ma gathered bandits to prepare guns. On July 23, it was decided to kidnap Zhu, Zhou, and Wu at the same time, and Xu himself scouted whether Zhu and others were at home. The next day (21), after Xu had scouted properly, he informed the bandit Ma, who led his followers Shen Jintao, Wang Asan, Wu Longcai (also known as A-er, from Jiangbei) Fan Jinsheng, Wang Maosheng, etc., to depart from Nanhui, take a bus to Tianfuan Station, where Xu Jintao arrived at the station at 5 pm, and discussed in a nearby teahouse. They set off at about 9 pm. They first went to Zhu Cailin's house. Xu Jintao humbly opened the door, and seven people poured in, took out pistols, and kidnapped Zhu and his wife. They kidnapped Zhou and Wu Caifu according to law. Halfway, Zhu's wife requested and was released. Then they changed the clothes they had prepared for the hostages to avoid being chased. In the Hanoi area, about eight miles from Zhoupu, they prepared two sailing boats at a price of 70,000 yuan each, guarded by the bandit concubines Gu Wanyun and Li Damei. When the hostages arrived at the river, they immediately boarded the boat and went straight to Nanhui and landed at the Xiama Ferry on Huangjialu, which was already about 8 am on the 22nd. Then they changed addresses every day and allowed the hostages freedom. Sometimes they even played cards with the bandits while conducting ransom negotiations. First, they asked for 700 shi of rice, then reduced it to 360 shi, which was worth 126 million yuan. They also agreed to give Xu Zhou 6 million yuan, so the bandits would net 120 million yuan. 30 million yuan was sent on July 30, and a 2 million yuan check was returned, and 20,000 yuan was missing. In fact, they had received 27.8 million yuan in cash. After the bandit Ma took 16 million yuan and spent more than 5 million yuan, the remaining money was all seized. It was also confessed that the bandit Ma was related to Zhang Dapeng of the New Fourth Army and claimed to be a brigade commander, preparing to expand the "team" after receiving the ransom. It was also confessed that in the case, because Deputy Director Zhang had made it clear that the bandits were from the New Fourth Army, they should not have committed this crime. Therefore, after clarifying the case, they pursued the rest, repeatedly inducing and threatening them, and finally confessed that when they were at the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall, they strangled a person to death in the dark, who was watching the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall. His surname was Ni, and Ni had two nephews, one named Ni Jilou and one named Ni A-er. Both were ruffians, and the brothers were enemies because of a dispute over housing. Ni A-er had said that he would kill his brother. Ni Jilou lived in Shanghai and worked as a tailor. He had been colleagues with the bandits Ma Fulou and Shen Jintao in the puppet army. And Ni Ma Shen and others were all tailors. At that time, Ni Jilou happened to return to Nanhui and accidentally met Ma Shen and others, and stored the hostages in his home (i.e., Zhong Temple). Ni A-er happened to see it, and Ma and others were afraid that he would leak the news, and Ni took the opportunity to seek revenge. Therefore, Shen Jintao, Wang Asan, and Huang Maosheng, etc., induced Ni A-er and strangled him to death with a rope, and threw his body into the nearby lake. The bandit Wu Longcai confessed that he was 22 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Wu's house in Dongpu, Minhang. The details of the crime he confessed were the same as the confession of the bandit Xu. The two bandit concubines also directly admitted the previous situation. The Garrison Command is now investigating and arresting the escaped bandits.</p>

<h3>New Typhoon Rising in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>After the typhoon that occurred in the Pacific Ocean passed Taiwan, it turned into a low-pressure system, and this city was fortunate to escape the attack, but due to the dissipation of the typhoon, the heat did not subside. Yesterday, according to the Meteorological Observatory, a weather warning signal was issued that a new typhoon was rising in the South Pacific. The new typhoon reached a position of 19 degrees north latitude and 132 degrees east longitude at 2 pm yesterday and is moving west-northwest. If the typhoon's direction does not change midway, Shanghai may still be attacked in a few days. According to the Meteorological Observatory's records, the highest temperature yesterday was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 79.1 degrees. The weather forecast for today is still sunny and hot.</p>
<h3>The Case of Yu Shengxiao's Murder: Investigation Gradually Becomes Clear; Multiple People Identify Cooley as the Arrested Englishman</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the case of the Westerner shooting Yu Shengxiao, significant progress was made yesterday. Since the Englishman Cooley was arrested and detained as a suspect, yesterday, the deceased's wife went to identify him and confirmed that the Cooley was the Cooley she was familiar with.</p>
<p>However, Cooley has consistently denied any involvement in the shooting, despite round-the-clock questioning by the police. It is now understood that the entire case is being investigated from two perspectives. On the one hand, Cooley himself is being interrogated, and on the other hand, relevant witnesses are being summoned for questioning.</p>
<p>According to a villager from Wu Jia Xiang, he was the first to discover Yu Shengxiao lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. Simultaneously, another villager testified that he did indeed witness a black sedan speeding on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway near the scene of the incident. The driver was described as a robust Westerner with a small mustache, wearing a white shirt. Another Westerner was in the passenger seat, seemingly leaning over and wiping something on the seat. At the time, unaware that an incident had occurred, he did not pay attention to the car's license plate number.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the police also investigated everything with Yu Shengxiao's colleagues. According to them, they also confirmed that the arrested Cooley was the Cooley they were familiar with. Furthermore, they pointed out that before 3 PM that afternoon, Cooley had tea with Yu Shengxiao at the Wai Tan (Bund) Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road, discussing a transaction. Around 3 PM, when Yu Shengxiao was walking towards the Fei Da Tailor Shop on Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, he mentioned the matter to someone in the shop, saying that Cooley would be driving there soon. However, around 4 PM, a heavy rain suddenly occurred. When the people in the shop remembered Yu Shengxiao, they searched for him but he was gone. At the time, they speculated that perhaps during the heavy rain, Cooley had driven nearby and picked up Yu Shengxiao.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Extortion While Wearing a Military Uniform</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A young man named Zhang Zhixiang, who claimed to be a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters, extorted 50 million legal tender from Hai Baoshan, the owner of a copy shop at 501 Anyuan Road. After being reported to the Garrison Headquarters, he was arrested at the Nanjing Road Hui Zhong Hotel at 1 PM yesterday while the payment was being made. Zhang was wearing a military officer's uniform and carrying firearms. It is understood that on the evening of the 27th of last month, Zhang, along with another soldier and two men in Western suits, went to the aforementioned address and accused Hai of being suspected of drug trafficking, intending to arrest him. After someone interceded, the matter was settled with 50 million. Besides paying 30 million in cash on the spot, the remaining amount was scheduled to be paid yesterday afternoon at the Hui Zhong Hotel. When Zhang was arrested, he had just received a Jin Yuan Qian Zhuang check for 20 million with today's date from Hai's hand. Before he could examine it, he was stopped by the Garrison Headquarters personnel behind him, who drew their guns.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the "Black Wind Fan": Government Agencies Request Allocation but Fail; However, It Appears on the Market</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to an official statement from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (ERRRA), there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the rumor that the agency sold 7,500 surplus electric fans between May 23 and July 5, with 1,000 of them being preferentially purchased by various import and export companies, eventually flowing into the black market. It is said that these fans were all 110 volts, designed specifically for use on ships, and did not meet general needs. Therefore, on May 23, 500 units were sold to various import and export companies, followed by a public sale of 1,000 units. Upon hearing the news, people rushed to apply for purchase. As of July 5, a total of 7,500 units had been sold. At this time, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA) suddenly notified the "ERRRA" that the stock of these fans was low, and the remaining units were reserved for the use of "UNRRA" and "ERRRA" themselves. The "ERRRA" immediately complied and stopped the allocation. There may have been improprieties in the handling of this matter, leading to the rumors. According to the "ERRRA", the allocation price of the electric fans was 400,000 yuan per unit, but currently, retailers in various shops and stalls seem to be selling them for 800,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report from the Hua Dong News Agency: The Finance Department of the Executive Yuan sold American-style wall-mounted 12-inch small fans last month and stopped the sale on the 3rd and 4th. Various government agencies and organizations rushed to request purchase, but were refused, claiming that they had been sold out. Surprisingly, this type of fan is being sold on the black market, priced at 600,000 or 800,000 per unit. According to the Executive Yuan's warehouse, there are more than 20,000 of these fans in total, and as of the day before yesterday, there were still more than 3,000 units in stock. Therefore, various parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>"Flying Saucer" Descends: Determined to be a Climate Measurement Device; Takahashi and Tian Ye Pick Up One with Two Spheres, Each Like a Watermelon</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The rumor that Takahashi obtained a "flying saucer" the day before yesterday spread widely and caused a sensation throughout the town, with everyone regarding it as a strange tale. Afterwards, the Takahashi Police Station took it back to the station for research. The result was that the so-called "flying saucer" was actually a type of "high-altitude measuring device."</p>
<p>Around 4 PM the day before yesterday, residents of the Huang Jia Wan area of Takahashi's First Bao spotted a white, luminous disc in the sky, drifting with the wind and falling into a field. Upon inspection, the so-called "flying saucer" was actually formed by two spheres, one blackish-brown and one silver-white, each about the size of a watermelon and made of rubber. Between the two spheres was a small white iron box about five inches square, containing a wireless radio. A small parachute was attached to the top. When the "flying saucer" was flying in the sky, the silver-white sphere at the bottom reflected sunlight, emitting a strong, dazzling white light. The letters "USA" were printed on it. Afterwards, according to an American technician from the Texas Oil Company in the area, this so-called "flying saucer" was actually a measuring device for measuring high-altitude climate. He had worked in an American meteorological instrument manufacturing factory for three years, so he knew this type of instrument very well and was sure it was not the "flying saucer" that the world was talking about.</p>
<h3>Owner of Hua Cheng Silk and Satin Dyeing Factory: Kidnapped While Visiting Buddha at Putuo; Rescued After Ten Days and Nights on a Bandit Ship and Returned to Shanghai; Four Monks and Temple Staff Suspected and Under Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It was rumored a few days ago that a wealthy businessman in this city was kidnapped in Putuo and a huge ransom was demanded, and it was rumored that the kidnapper was a certain abbot of a famous temple in this city. After much inquiry by reporters, the intricate and bizarre details of this kidnapping case have come to light. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chen Jinliang, a native of Shaoxing, who resides at No. 9, Lane 762, Chengdu Road, in this city, is in his sixties and has been running the Hua Cheng Silk and Satin Dyeing Factory there for many years. He is usually devoutly Buddhist and has a close friendship with the former abbot of the Taiping Temple on Chengdu Road, Monk Mingjiao. Mingjiao has been retired for many years and has a close relationship with his teacher Zhen Da (80 years old) and his disciple Xing Kong (the current abbot). On June 30, Chen wanted to go to Putuo to conduct a water and land ceremony (a Buddhist ritual) to commemorate his deceased relatives. He made an appointment with Zhen Da and Xing Kong to take the "Hai Shen" to leave Shanghai. Since Taiping Temple is a sub-temple of the San Sheng Tang in Putuo, Chen's trip to Putuo was at the invitation of Xing Kong. Therefore, the temple specifically notified a temple staff member named "Xiao Xiang" before the trip, who specializes in picking up and dropping off pilgrims between Shanghai and Putuo, to come to Shanghai and accompany them as a guide.</p>
<p>On July 1, Chen and his party safely arrived at the San Sheng Tang in Putuo. From the 4th to the 11th, they performed a week-long ceremony. Chen's wife and daughter were also brought to Putuo by Xiao Xiang on the next ship from Shanghai. After the merit was completed, Chen led his wife and daughter to visit various temples to light incense and worship Buddha. On the 13th, they planned to wait for a ship to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, disaster struck, and an incident occurred that night. At 1 AM that night, the moon was dark, the wind was high, and the sea was surging. More than a dozen bandits suddenly appeared in front of the San Sheng Tang, each carrying modern weapons. They rushed over the wall with a roar and went straight to Chen's bedroom, pointing at Chen and asking who he was. Chen usually did not like to dress up, and at this time, the matter was urgent, and his two plain clothes made him look even less like a wealthy guest. He falsely claimed that he had been suffering from chronic illness and had come across the sea to seek medical treatment, hoping to find a magical formula for his illness. The bandits hesitated a little and were about to turn away. At this time, someone outside the door suddenly shouted in the darkness that Chen was a wealthy man from Shanghai and asked why they were waiting to act. The bandits, without thinking twice, immediately dragged Chen and others down the mountain and onto a small boat moored at the foot of the mountain. Chen knelt down and begged them to release his wife and daughter, but the bandits ignored him and put Chen and others in the bottom cabin. Because there was no ventilation, they were suffocating and about to die. They asked the bandits to open the hatch slightly. One bandit used his finger to dig a small hole in the top of the hatch. Chen tried his best to look out, but he only saw shadows of people and piles of boxes and luggage in the surrounding darkness, which were all the luggage that had been looted and boarded the ship.</p>
<p>When it was dawn, it was drizzling. The ship docked on an unnamed sandy beach, and the bandits took Chen and others into the mountains. The next evening, they forced them to board the ship again. Chen and others in the cabin only heard the sound of wind and waves hitting the ship, not knowing where they were going. It was not until the third day that they began negotiations in a jumble of strange rocks and mountains. At the beginning of the negotiations, the bandits called Chen the Chen boss of the rubber factory, but Chen strongly denied it. The bandits demanded 40 gold bars, but Chen only agreed to 3 small bars. In the end, the bandits lowered the price to 480 million in cash, and Chen increased it to 200 million, saying that if they could not reach an agreement, he would rather be killed at sea. Seeing that the situation could not be forced any further, the bandits agreed.</p>
<p>After the negotiations were completed, the bandits sent someone to the San Sheng Tang to contact the abbot Xing De (Xing Kong's teacher and brother), saying that if Xing De could take full responsibility for Chen, they and the San Sheng Tang would each send someone to Shanghai to collect the money. Because Xing De was not familiar with the situation in Shanghai, he refused. Xing Kong, motivated by righteousness, and realizing that Chen's trip to Putuo was at his invitation, and friendship was important, volunteered to go. The bandits also told him that he must be fully responsible for the payment and protection of the bandits after arriving in Shanghai. If there were any mistakes, Chen's life would be in danger, and the San Sheng Tang would be razed to the ground. After an agreement was reached, Xing Kong accompanied a bandit to Shanghai on the 19th to notify Chen's family, who collected 100 million in cash and 3 large gold bars, and handed them over. On the 21st, the bandit leader received the full amount. At the same time, since Chen was kidnapped on the 14th, he was still escorted by the bandits on a ship every night, moving through various mountains. It was not until the 23rd that they ordered Xing De to come to the bandit's lair to issue a guarantee and release Chen and others. At that time, the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities, because the sea area of Putuo was not peaceful, were preparing to launch a suppression campaign. The bandits, seeing the urgent situation, waited for a civilian ship to approach the shore, drove Chen and others off the ship, sailed to Shenjiamen in Dinghai, and changed ships to Ningbo, where they met with their family members who were waiting in Ningbo and came to Shanghai. On the 25th, the San Sheng Tang notified the Hua Cheng Dyeing Factory by long-distance telephone that Chen and others had returned to Shanghai on a China Merchants Bureau ship. Before this, the Xin Cheng Police Station had already sent officers to monitor the telephone related to the dyeing factory after the case occurred. At this point, they led a large number of police officers to ambush at the China Merchants Bureau wharf. When the ship docked, they intercepted Chen and others, and at the same time arrested Xing Kong, Xiao Xiang, Xing Xian (also a monk from the San Sheng Tang), and another temple staff member who had been dismissed from the San Sheng Tang and returned to Shanghai, Zhou Shengquan, on another ship that arrived at the same time. All four were taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<p>It is understood that a few days after this case occurred, there was news that three Shanghai benefactors in Putuo Guangfu Temple were suddenly kidnapped during a water and land ceremony. The great Buddhist environment is about to become a Shura hell.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Qin Returns to Beijing to Report; The Jin Du Case to be Tried Soon; Exchanged Opinions at Mayor's Dinner Yesterday</h3>
<p>Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, was ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Jin Du (Golden Capital) constitutional police conflict incident and completed his task. He took an express train back to Beijing at 11 PM on the 3rd, accompanied by Peng Weiren, Director of the Supervisory Bureau, and others. Before his departure, Qin met with reporters from the Central News Agency and said that during his two days in Shanghai, he listened to reports and opinions from various parties regarding the case and would submit a comprehensive report to President Chiang. The investigation of this case is more important than the trial. Now that the investigation has been completed, the trial can be held in Shanghai within one or two days. The form of the trial will be that the military court will try the military personnel, and the judicial organs will try the non-military personnel. Qin denied that he would personally serve as the presiding judge of the court in this case, but revealed that a military judge from the Ministry of National Defense would be appointed to this position.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, Qin had a long discussion with Speaker Pan Gongzhan, who visited him, and Director Yu Shuping. On the evening of the 3rd, he attended a dinner hosted by Mayor Wu, accompanied by Commander Yi, Speaker Pan, and Wang Zhe, the supervisor of the Police Headquarters. During the dinner, they once again exchanged views on the case.</p>
<p>It is also understood that Bao Qihuang, Chief of the Prosecution Section of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and Meng Taisheng, and others, will arrive in Shanghai from Beijing at 8 AM on the 4th.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Qin is scheduled to take the night train from Beijing to Shanghai again no later than tonight.</p>
<h3>Postmaster Li Jinlu Broadcasts: Basic Viewpoints of Postal Service: Serving the Public is the Blood Vessel, Not Profiting from the Public</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] This newspaper held the 18th Sunday Special Broadcast at the China Cultural Radio Station yesterday, inviting Li Jinlu, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, to broadcast "Basic Viewpoints of Postal Service." The following is a record of the main points of his speech:</p>
<p>The postal system started earliest in our country. According to historical records, as early as the early Zhou Dynasty, there were rudimentary post stations. During the Han and Tang Dynasties, post pavilions and stations were all over the official roads. This system was most developed. However, the establishment of the modern postal service is only 50 years old. It was initially managed by the customs, and it was not until the third year of Xuantong that the General Post Office was established to operate independently.</p>
<p>Dong Zhongshu, a great Confucian scholar of the Han Dynasty, said: "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit, clarify its principles without calculating its merit." I now want to "take it out of context" and apply this sentence to the postal service. "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit" can be said to be the inherent characteristic of public enterprises such as the post office, and "clarify its principles without calculating its merit" can be said to be the virtue that postal personnel should possess.</p>
<p>Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit</p>
<p>Why is "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit" the inherent characteristic of public enterprises? We know that among all public enterprises, the post office is closest to the public. From big cities to remote villages, from high officials to peddlers, everyone has social relations and everyone needs communication. The postal service is an institution set up to facilitate the public. Therefore, the post office should be the people's post office, the post office of everyone who uses the post office. The purpose of this institution is to serve the public, not to profit from the public. If there is a surplus in business, the surplus should be used to promote work and improve facilities. In other words, what is taken from the people should be used for the people. Advanced countries in the world adopt the postal economic independence system, which is also the meaning of this. Our China cannot do this. Due to traffic obstacles, social instability, huge expenses, and sharp decline in income, by May this year, the national postal economic loss has reached 206.94 billion. Insufficient postal charges, we cannot but rely on government subsidies. However, we are not getting subsidies to survive, but actively using them to improve facilities and promote business. In a word, it is used in undertakings that benefit the public. As long as this thing should be done, we will do it, "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit." We are not only not seeking its profit, but also losing a lot of money, because we believe that the postal service is to serve the public and should take the interests of the public as the premise.</p>
<p>Clarify its principles without calculating its merit</p>
<p>Why is "Clarify its principles without calculating its merit" the virtue that postal personnel should possess? This reason is very simple. Since the post office is a service institution, postal personnel must take service as their mission. Postal personnel must pass strict examinations when entering the bureau to be employed. This is the initial test of whether they can be competent. After entering the bureau, due to the strictness of the reward and punishment assessment system, they are always improving while working and learning. Postal personnel have a common spirit, which is "Treat the post office as home." At present, those who have entered the bureau for eight or ten years are considered junior personnel. Those who have served for nearly 40 years, like myself, are everywhere. Since we regard the post office as a lifelong career, we must love the post office, study the post office, and understand the mission that the post office bears to the public. In the past year, the post office has worked hard in extremely difficult circumstances, and it has also been inspired by this spirit. We are willing to accept all criticisms and thank all parties for their past cooperation. As the saying goes: "The task is heavy and the road is long." The road is still long, and the night for us to explore is also long. Looking forward to the future, we hope that the public will continue to give us guidance and support so that this undertaking for the people can achieve greater and further development.</p>

<h3>All Circles Hold Military Service Propaganda Conference: "Nation Building Must First Build the Military"; A Song "Joining the Army"</h3>
<p>Lyrics written by Pan Gongzhan seeking a composer to set to music</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Military Service Propaganda Conference was held at Lidu Garden, Taixing Road, at 10 AM yesterday. More than 500 representatives from the literary, news, drama, film, and broadcasting circles attended. Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Fu Zhengmo, Zhang Xiaosong, and others formed the presidium. A letter to all compatriots and the main points of propaganda were also published. At the beginning of the conference, Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, delivered a speech, stating briefly that Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and this is the first time that military service is being handled. The success or failure of this will have a significant impact on future military administration. Shanghai has made great contributions to the country in the past, from the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition to the "January 28th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident," it has made brilliant contributions in history. Now, at the critical moment of nation-building, the Communist bandits are causing chaos, and the government's implementation of the military service system to seek permanent stability for the country is necessary. Some people mistakenly believe that Shanghai is a city of enjoyment, and that promoting military administration will be difficult, but in fact, the citizens of Shanghai are the most righteous. For this conscription, the central government has specially approved the conscription of 3,000 volunteers first. Given Shanghai's past contributions to the country, it is expected that it will be completed smoothly voluntarily. Then, Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, delivered a speech, reporting that the district under his jurisdiction includes Shanghai and thirteen other counties. A total of 11,000 people will be conscripted. According to the population ratio, Shanghai should conscript 6,000 people. The central government considers Shanghai to be a commercial and industrial area, so it has reduced the number by half to 3,000, and volunteers will be conscripted first. Shanghai has a high cultural level, accurate household registration, and a strong patriotic consciousness among its citizens, so military administration is easier to implement. The Civil Affairs Bureau is now preparing various tasks, and training will begin after the new conscription camp is completed. Student military training will be implemented from the next semester and will also be the responsibility of the garrison district. Again, Fang Wei Bian, a member of the Military Service Propaganda Committee, gave a speech, explaining that the military service propaganda methods have been formulated. Conscription today is to protect the country. If the country can be protected, the family can also be safe. Fang also put forward anti-bureaucratization of military service, anti-degradation of military service, anti-commercialization of military service, and support for democratization of military service. He called on all citizens to actively participate in military service, and hoped that Kuomintang members would encourage their children to serve in the military, take the lead, protect the country, and eliminate the source of chaos. Subsequently, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the City, as the organizer of military service, requested assistance from all sectors at any time. If any of his subordinates commit corruption in handling military administration, he also hopes that all sectors will report the facts and will be severely punished. Zhang also gave a detailed report on the conscription steps, volunteers and preferential treatment issues. Again, Xu Jilun and Sun Choucheng and Sun Xiangzhong, who were volunteers 40 years ago, gave speeches one after another. Then the entertainment began, Zhou Xuan broadcasted and sang famous songs such as "Golden God Dances in the Autumn Wind" and "Night Fragrance," and then the conference ended in high spirits.</p>
<p>[Another report] Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, wrote a song "Good Man, Join the Army" on the spot at yesterday's conference, welcoming composers to set it to music, and the association will give a generous reward. The lyrics are as follows: "Good man, join the army, nation building must first build the military, war without courage is not filial, holding a spear to defend the country is a good citizen, a great and powerful new China, the youth army is the vanguard for the people, parents, wives, brothers, sisters, relatives and friends send them off together, joyfully enter the camp, protect the country, protect the乡and protect the home, to be a hero, first join the army, good man, join the army, good man, join the army."</p>
<h3>Tianlong Lun Completed and Sailed; Sailed to South Sakhalin Island Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Our country's shipping industry has actively planned to expand overseas routes after the victory. The China Merchants Bureau's China-India Line and China-Japan Line have already been opened, and the China-U.S. San Francisco Line is also being planned. The China Shipping Company's Tianlong Lun, with a total tonnage of 10,473 tons, was originally the Niels Maersk of the Maersk Company. After being purchased by the China Shipping Company, it was renamed Tianlong and has been operating on the coastal and Nanyang lines for more than a year. Recently, it has completed its annual maintenance and is said to have been chartered by a British merchant from London. It left Shanghai yesterday and first sailed to South Sakhalin Island to load 4,500 tons of paper, of which 2,500 tons will be unloaded in Marseille and 2,000 tons will be shipped to England. The ship's outbound procedures have been completed, and the crew has been vaccinated by the seaport quarantine station. It is also understood that after loading paper from Sakhalin Island and sailing to Europe, it will still need to go to Shanghai. After the ship goes to England, it will regularly sail on the Atlantic British-American route and will not return to China for the time being. According to the company, the lease is for more than one year, and it is scheduled to return to China in November next year. After the ship returns to China, the company will operate its own foreign routes. A national ship chartered to Europe and sailing on the Atlantic Ocean can be called a new record in our country's shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Conflict with Butchers While Cooling Off: Homicide Occurs on Liú Hé Road</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A male corpse with eight apparent stab wounds was discovered yesterday morning near the side of Liú Hé Road by the back gate of Lǎ Gé Nà Elementary School, now renamed the Fifth Central National School, on Huáng Hé Road. Upon receiving the report, the Sōng Shān Police Precinct promptly dispatched officers to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Tāng Dé Fā, 30 years old, formerly a police officer at the Cháng Shú Road Police Station. He had been dismissed last winter and was temporarily residing at the Star Hotel, No. 40 Liú Hé Road. Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Tāng was cooling off in front of the hotel due to the heat when, coincidentally, a noodle stall was set up at the intersection on the east side. A certain rickshaw puller, Mr. Jiǎ, parked his rickshaw in the middle of the road and began eating at the noodle stall. At the same time, a "wild pheasant" (reckless individual) riding a tricycle accidentally overturned a tofu stand while turning a corner. The vendor grabbed him and demanded compensation. Six or seven butchers from the cattle slaughtering company, who were eating at the noodle stall, seeing this, stepped forward to harass the "wild pheasant." Tāng, witnessing everything, objected to the butchers' actions and argued with them. He was immediately surrounded and severely beaten, causing him to bleed from his mouth and nose. The perpetrators then scattered. Tāng crawled to that location and died from his injuries. The Sōng Shān Police Precinct is currently pursuing the suspects.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Residents on Jīn Líng Road</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, two thieves broke into the home of Shǐ Yǒng Líng at No. 35 Bā Xiān Fāng, Jīn Líng Road, and, wielding guns, robbed him of gold and silver jewelry worth over 50 million.

<h3>Indictment of Wáng Yǒng Kāng: Participation in the Communist Army and Murder</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wáng Yǒng Kāng, a native of Cháng Zhōu, resided at No. 38 Sōng Mào Lane, Pseudo Pān Road. In 1942, Wáng joined the New Fourth Army in Cháng Zhōu and served as the vice-chairman of the Yì Chén Relief Association. Subsequently, due to a conflict with Lǐ Bǐng Dà, who was in charge of tax affairs for the New Fourth Army, on the evening of June 19th, 1945 (lunar calendar), Wáng, together with a lewd monk, Shěn Zǔ Tóu, Wáng Zǐ Liáng, and others, strangled Lǐ Bǐng Dà to death with hemp rope. Recently, he fled to Shàng Hǎi and was reported to the Yáng Shù Pǔ Police Precinct, who detained him and transferred him to the High Procuratorate for investigation. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the New Fourth Army was a bandit force organized by traitors, illegally occupying land and betraying the central government, and had long been ordered to disband by the government. The defendant served as vice-chairman in the agricultural relief association established by the bandits and had committed murder. Therefore, he is guilty under Article 100, Paragraph 1, Article 271, Paragraph 1, and Article 28 of the Criminal Code, and a public prosecution is initiated in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Lú Yīng's Sworn Brotherhood: Hú Bǎo Xiáng Suspected of Crimes</h3>
<p>The High Procuratorate Has Filed a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Hú Bǎo Xiáng, father of Hú Chéng, a team leader in the enemy gendarmerie, served as an inspector in the Shàng Hǎi Municipal Police Bureau before the war and was a sworn brother of Lú Yīng, the former captain of the bureau's Detective Team. During the enemy puppet regime, Lú Yīng became the deputy director of the puppet Shàng Hǎi Municipal Police Bureau, and Hú Bǎo Xiáng served as the puppet inspector-general of the bureau. Later, he fell out with Lú Yīng and was reassigned as a major adjutant in the puppet Security Command. The First Branch of the Hé Běi High Court transferred the case to the High Procuratorate of this city for investigation.

<h3>Everyone Has a Father: Preparations for Father's Day Celebration Approaching August 8th</h3>
<p>Father's Day, August 8th, is fast approaching. The Promotion Committee, composed of Pān Gōng Zhǎn, Wú Jìng Héng, Lǐ Shí Zēng, Yán Huì Qìng, Qián Yǒng Míng, Dù Yuè Shēng, Chéng Zhōng Xíng, Xú Jì Kāng, and others, believes that honoring one's parents and repaying their kindness is profoundly meaningful and especially important in these troubled times. Therefore, upholding the spirit of last year's enthusiastic national commemoration, they have, after several consultations, finalized the following plan: (1) Soliciting essays titled "My Father." From the date of the announcement in the newspaper, July 14th, until the 21st, over two thousand submissions were received from people across the country. After evaluation, the winning essays were those of Chén Sòng Píng, Zhāng Shàng Zhū, Liú Qǐ Fèng, Xiè Kāi Dé, and others, totaling fifteen essays, and three poems by Wèi Bīng Xīn, Zhōu Zài Xíng, Zhōng Rú Zhōu and others. Prizes will be awarded on August 8th, and all winning entries will be published in the "Children's Stories" monthly magazine published by the Children's Book Bureau for commemoration. (2) Radio speeches. The winners of the previous Mandarin speech contest organized by the Education Bureau, three from each of the elementary, middle, and high school groups, were specially invited to write an essay titled "My Thoughts on Father's Day" and broadcast it on the radio at 9:00 AM on the 8th. Chén Qīng Shí was invited as the judge, and all participants will receive valuable gifts. (3) Family ceremonies. Everyone has a father, and everyone should respect their father. Therefore, the association advocates that each family must commemorate Father's Day individually. For example, at 9:00 AM on the 8th, children should wear red flowers and pay their respects to their parents with speeches (those whose fathers have passed away should wear white flowers and pay respects to their portraits). Those whose parents are in their hometowns or far away should send letters or telegrams to express their filial piety. Families should also hold symposiums, plays, banquets, and present gifts to commemorate the day, enjoying family happiness and increasing family fun, which is meaningful both publicly and privately. (4) Holding a commemorative meeting. The association has scheduled a commemorative ceremony for 9:00 AM on Father's Day at the Youth Association Auditorium. Yán Huì Qìng will deliver a speech, and Pān Gōng Zhǎn will present awards (to the essay and speech contestants). A movie will also be screened for a grand celebration. All are welcome to attend freely. (5) Expanding publicity. In addition to asking major businesses to donate over ten roadside billboards for advertisements, all major movie theaters will show slides starting today, and the Shēn Bào has been entrusted to ask all Shàng Hǎi radio stations to broadcast in advance. Large white banners will be hung in central urban areas, slogans will be posted along the roads, public military vehicles will display slogans, and major cities and newspapers will be requested to publish news and write editorials, spreading the message as widely as possible to deeply root it in the hearts of the people. (6) Selling commemorative flowers. The association has commissioned the Youth Association to lead 500 impoverished middle and high school students to sell specially made commemorative flowers along the streets on the 7th and 8th, with the proceeds used for student aid.</p>
<h3>The Overlord Flaps Its Wings and Roars: Reporters Fly in Formation: A Brief Jaunt Over Háng Zhōu Bay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] To expand its international air routes, China National Aviation Corporation recently added six new DC-4 "Skymaster" giant aircraft. To introduce the performance and equipment of these new aircraft to the outside world, the company openly invited the press of this city for a test flight yesterday afternoon. Nearly a hundred people went to participate in the test flight, drawn by the name of the "Overlord," three times the number invited by the company, which shows the general excitement. They were divided into two batches, with the destination being a round trip over Háng Zhōu Bay. The actual time spent flying each round trip was only forty minutes, but the takeoff and landing took more than twenty minutes because of the large size of the aircraft.</p>
<p>The "Skymaster," as its name implies, has tremendous power. The entire fuselage is silver-white, with four giant engines, each with a three-bladed propeller.</p>
<p>No Number 13 Seat</p>
<p>The fuselage is about twice as large as that of ordinary single-engine passenger planes. The cabin has forty-four seats, each numbered, but seat number 13 is notably absent, presumably due to its association with bad luck, and number 45 is the last seat. The seat cushions and backs are covered with exquisite foam rubber, which is more elastic than ordinary spring sofas. The armrests are equipped with buttons, and with a slight touch, the seat back can be extended to a certain angle as desired. Sitting upright in it is soft and comfortable. Moreover, due to the large size of the plane and the smooth flight, one does not initially realize that they are soaring above six thousand feet. The cockpit is located at the front of the aircraft. A first officer and a pilot sit side by side, chatting and laughing casually while flying. There is also a radio operator to maintain constant radio contact with the ground. It is said that if one or two of the four engines fail during flight, the other engines will continue to operate until a safe landing is achieved.</p>
<p>Air Hostesses as Companions</p>
<p>In addition, each plane is accompanied by two "air hostesses." Those accompanying yesterday were Lán Huì Lán and Hé Shū Zhēn, both from Guǎng Dōng. Both young ladies are graceful and lithe, fluent in both the Shàng Hǎi and Guǎng Dōng dialects, and proficient in English. Long-distance passengers will have all travel fatigue disappear under the careful care of these "air hostesses".</p>
<p>The Overlord hovered in the sky over Shàng Hǎi for only ten minutes, and the myriad facets of this great international city were already fully visible. Looking around, one could see red-tiled roofs everywhere, with the Broadway Mansion, International Hotel, and other large buildings resembling toy blocks. The Pǔ River curved like a ribbon, with sailboats dotting the water and warships appearing like models.</p>
<p>The Fields Stretch Green Without End</p>
<p>Once out of the city, one could see crisscrossing fields and endless green pastures. After another ten minutes, we were over Háng Zhōu Bay, a vast expanse of ripples with only three lush islands standing tall in the middle. In the distance, a thin mist shrouded the scene, blurring the line between the water and the sky. Suddenly, the fuselage tilted slightly, and the plane turned back towards home. After another twenty minutes, the fuselage had reached the setting sun and slowly landed on the newly constructed, wide cement runway at Lóng Huá Airport. Throughout the entire journey, none of the passengers felt unwell, nor were there any instances of vomiting, which alone seems sufficient to indicate the unique performance of the "Skymaster."</p>

There is a high water tower, tidy barracks, clean classrooms and a large playground in the camp. Trees are planted all over the camp, with willow-lined paths. A few steps into the camp gate, you can see a wooden sign standing on the side of the road, with white characters on a red background, writing the words "We use summer vacation to exercise our bodies, review our homework, strengthen unity, and serve the society." This is the purpose of the cadre bureau holding the summer camp, and it is also the criterion for the lives of all students.</p>

<h3>The Nán Jīng Municipal Council: Defeats the Toilet Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nán Jīng] The toilet tax proposal was the most eye-catching item at the recent meeting of the Nán Jīng Municipal Council. The word "toilet" has become a special term in Nán Jīng. A toilet tax is especially rare in the world. No wonder the councilors brought it up, which is really a finale scene. The question was raised by Zhào Xìn Chén, who requested the assembly to deny the hard collection of a 5,000 yuan toilet tax per unit by the Feces Management Office. It was seconded by Liú Shǒu Yīng and twelve others, but after the proposal was discussed, the councilors expressed their opinions one after another, and the debate was very intense. One or two councilors even slammed the table and roared, and the order of the meeting was very chaotic. Chairman Chén was almost at a loss. Zhào Xìn Chén, Liú Shǒu Yīng, Xià Shí, Wú Fèng Míng, Zhāng Wén Bó, and others firmly advocated that the collection should be stopped immediately, and that the collection of the toilet tax without review by the council was illegal, and those who had been collected should be refunded as soon as possible. If the municipal government has already collected a cleaning tax, it feels too harsh and miscellaneous. Some people said that the Feces Management Office is a contractor system, which is contracted by the "King of Feces". They can eat feces, use feces, and collect feces, so what does the Health Bureau manage? Why not take it back and do it yourself? However, Wú Yán Qí, Gù Fù Chū, and others who held the opposite view, said that this charge is not in the nature of a "donation", but a fee for brushing toilets on behalf of the people, which is cheaper than employing a servant to brush it. It should be recognized, and the Feces Management Office can be instructed to try it for three months to wash away the shame of "stinky Nán Jīng". However, the opposition immediately refuted it, using the excuse of brushing the toilet on behalf of the people, but asking which family's toilet was brushed by them, and each household has a nanny to clean the toilet, even if there is no nanny, it is brushed by the old woman herself, so why bother them to do it for them? Moreover, according to the custom of Nán Jīng, the feces of a certain household are collected by the vegetable garden, and in the autumn, they are still sent pickled vegetables as thanks. Now that the feces have been taken away, it is unreasonable to collect fees again. Wú Fèng Míng also stood up and shouted loudly: "Who ordered the collection of the toilet tax? Who entrusted the brushing?" The original proposer, Zhào Xìn Chén, also shouted wildly: "When councilors are campaigning for votes, they all use speaking for the people as publicity. Now they are speaking for the contractors, where is their conscience?" Later, Zhāng Wén Bó suggested: (1) The municipal government should formulate appropriate methods for handling feces and send them to the council for review. (2) Before the above methods are formulated, the municipal government shall order that the "toilet tax" be stopped immediately and all those collected be refunded. (3) If the Feces Management Office collects toilet taxes and there is suspicion of fraud, the municipal government should investigate and send it to the court for handling. As a result, it was passed by a majority vote. This farce of "the preliminary of people's rights" has come to a temporary end. (Special Correspondent Dīng Kuāng Huá)</p>

<h3>Large Clam Harvested in Dàn Shuǐ Pond, Jīn Huá: Weighs 18 Market Pounds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Jīn Huá] There is a place called Qián Pond in Zázhù Village, Jiāng Xiǎo Township, this county. The water is very deep and has never dried up for many years. Recently, rumors have spread that a water monster has appeared, shocking the whole village, causing fear and anxiety. A village child went to the pond to bathe, and his left foot was entangled by the "monster", and he escaped and returned. Then there were several brave village farmers who did not believe this and went into the water to fish. After more than an hour, they actually caught a large clam, weighing 18 market pounds. It is rare to get such a giant clam in a freshwater pond, and it is now being maintained by a villager named Guō. (1st)</p>
<h3>Digging Ponds to Fill Ponds: People of Sōng Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Sōng Jiāng] The Jīn Shān Zuǐ seawall in Sōng Jiāng was originally a barrier for the north of the seawall. After the first phase of the dangerous project was completed, the second phase of the project has been carrying out soil filling work. However, the Engineering Office came up with a whimsical idea to use the road construction locomotives of the Engineering Bureau to dig mud on the seawall surface at both the east and west ends of the new pond, causing the original pond body to become a depression of more than a foot deep and more than a mile long. The harm of digging ponds to fill ponds is obvious. What is even worse is that there are two or three layers of old piles outside the new pond. Although they have been broken and peeled off, they are still very effective in resisting huge waves. Now they are ordered to be sawn off by workers, so the County Seawall Committee, in addition to questioning the Engineering Office, also sent a letter to the Jiāng Nán Seawall Engineering Association to appeal, and the people of Sōng also expressed their opposition.</p>

<h3>Three Robbers Who Repeatedly Robbed a Nunnery Escorted to the Local Court</h3>
<p>[Jiā Xīng Report] There is a nunnery in Xiāo Jiā Huì, Cháng Xīng Town, Jiā Xīng County. The houses are quite spacious. Last year, thieves stole one stone of rice and five dòu of rapeseed, and the tracking was unsuccessful. This spring, when the nuns were chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, suddenly three thugs rushed in, holding sharp刺 knives, intending to rob property, but they did not succeed. They ate two glutinous rice balls offered on the altar and left at random. In mid-April, the nunnery was stolen again at night for two loads of grain. On the evening of the "Buddha Bathing Festival", bandits broke into the door again, holding sharp knives, threatening the nuns not to speak out, and then searched the entire nunnery and left. A few days ago, the security class of the township government captured three suspects, Chén Jīn Shēng, Chén Zhǎng Lín, and Chén Xiǎo Mǎ.

<h3>Three Evils of Sichuan: Opium, Bandits, and Gelaohui</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Chengdu, July 28th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>This year is the year of total eradication of opium in Sichuan. The last phase of the anti-opium work should have ended last month, but what is the opium situation in Sichuan this year? At the opening of the Provincial Council, Chairman Deng Xihou gave an impassioned speech, determined to eradicate the three evils of Sichuan – opium, bandits, and Gelaohui. Councilors from all over the province angrily reported on the opium situation, which was sad, lamentable, infuriating, and hateful. Councilor Chen Rangqing estimated that there are currently 14 opium-affected areas in the province, each consuming an average of 5.2 billion yuan worth of opium per month, totaling 8.736 trillion yuan per year for the entire province. What an alarming figure! Ouyang Jie said that opium is widespread in eastern Sichuan, and the Chongqing-Wanxian highway and all the water and land docks along the Jialing River have become distribution centers for opium. Jin Xiaogeng said that government opium suppression personnel use fake opium to replace real opium when submitting it, and the investigators dare not even report sedan chair carriers smoking opium, let alone declare that they are investigators, or else no one will carry the chair. Lou Yuanliang asked if the provincial government knew that the Wanyuan-Xuanhan security team was selling opium. Wu Jieping asked why the provincial government did not question the county magistrate and security commander of Wangcang County, who were collaborating to sell opium. Peng Wangping even loudly urged Chairman Deng to discuss with Chairman Liu of Xikang to plant less opium in Xikang. These heartfelt statements represent the public opinion of the 50 million people of Sichuan. The enlightened provincial government will not deny the seriousness of the opium problem in Sichuan today, and also sincerely stated that "heavy punishments should be used in chaotic times" and is willing to "borrow heads to eliminate the opium scourge." Today, the key to opium suppression in Sichuan lies in "doing rather than just talking." We believe in the provincial government's determination to suppress opium, but the issue lies in the thoroughness of implementation. This year is the year of total opium eradication, and also the year of total mobilization. Whether the opium scourge that has plagued the country for centuries can be eradicated depends on the determination of the authorities!</p>
<p>As for the bandits and "muddy water Gelaohui," which are the other two of the three evils of Sichuan, they are the two major tumors that have harmed society in Sichuan for years, and are a vicious obstacle to social order. In mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, stability in the rear should be the top priority, but the security situation in Sichuan this year is not yet optimistic. In the Provincial Council, councilors actively questioned the Director of the Security Department on security issues. Chen Zhijian asked if the Provincial Pacification Headquarters had a plan to eradicate the bandit leader Qu Beijie, who has been rampant for years in the area bordering Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Peng. Zhou Gang asked if the Provincial Pacification Headquarters was determined to completely eradicate the area bordering Sichuan, Kang, and Shaanxi in the 16th District, which has been a breeding ground for opium and bandits for years, in order to cooperate with opium suppression. Shao Yiyang said that grassroots politics are unsound, and local security teams often collude with township chiefs to protect opium, gambling, and condone thieves. Liu Ding and Li Minghe both spoke up for the security teams, saying that security soldiers only receive three shi of rice and 16,000 yuan for food per month, which is not enough to maintain their livelihood, so how can they provide security?</p>
<p>The so-called "muddy water Gelaohui" are a mixture of local tyrants, evil gentry, illegal elements, and special forces in society. They often use special powers to engage in various illegal activities, committing all kinds of crimes. Opium, bandits, and "muddy water Gelaohui" form a tripod, forming the three evils of Sichuan society today. The Provincial Pacification Headquarters has spared no effort in maintaining security over the years. Chairman Deng and the Director of the Security Department have also explained the importance of security and the determination to suppress bandits. Frankly speaking, the security situation this year has improved significantly compared to last year, but the problem is that it has not yet been coordinated with the general mobilization!</p>
<p>Mobilizing to suppress the rebellion is another major responsibility of Sichuan to the country after the war of resistance against Japan. The prerequisite for mobilization is social stability. Before mobilization, we would like to extract practical ways to govern Sichuan from the introduction of the current political, educational, and social situation in Sichuan by the councilors at the final meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Council.</p>

<h3>Shen Jianshi Dies Suddenly: Suffers a Cerebral Hemorrhage at a Banquet for Hang Liwu - Hu Shi, Ma Heng, and Others Form a Funeral Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The scholar Shen Jianshi, the current dean of the Faculty of Arts at Fu Jen Catholic University, suddenly died of a cerebral hemorrhage at his residence in Peiping last night at the age of 61. Hang Liwu, Hu Shi, Ma Heng, Chen Yuan, and others have formed a funeral committee, drafted a brief biography, and collected Shen's posthumous works. Shen's body was placed in a coffin at 6:00 a.m. today and moved to Jiaxing Temple. A memorial service will be held at Fu Jen Catholic University on the 17th. Shen was from Wu Xing, Zhejiang. He is survived by a wife (who suffers from mental illness) and four daughters. His son died young. He was the younger brother of the famous scholar Shen Yinmo. He studied in Japan and graduated from Tokyo Physics School. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature at the Peking University Research Institute, then as a professor of Chinese and French Literature at Xiamen University, deputy curator of the Archives of the Palace Museum, dean of the Faculty of Arts at Peking University, professor at Tsinghua University, dean of the Faculty of Arts at Fu Jen Catholic University. After the victory, he served as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education in Peiping and Tianjin, and worked extremely hard to take over cultural and educational institutions. He is the author of "Literary Guidance," "Talking About Ghosts," "The Evolution of Ancient Literature in Philology and Its Promotion," and other books. His old friend Hu Shi told reporters this morning that Shen hosted a banquet for Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu at his residence at 7:00 p.m. last night, inviting Hu Shi, Ma Heng, and others to accompany him. Before taking their seats, they chatted and laughed, showing no signs of illness. The guests were all fortunate that Shen was over 60 years old and had not a single white hair. Shen also asked the guests to inscribe words. Afterwards, he suddenly shouted that he had a headache, followed by hardening of the blood vessels. He died before treatment could be given. Our country has lost an authoritative scholar and philologist. Shen has no assets other than books. The coffin was arranged by Fu Jen Catholic University. Hu Shi was filled with emotion and mentioned the high cost of coffins, and strongly supported cremation, which is both economical and sanitary.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu went to Tianjin on the morning of the 3rd to inspect Nankai University and other schools, and is scheduled to return to Peiping that night. On the evening of the 2nd, Shen Jianshi died of a cerebral hemorrhage while hosting a banquet for Hang Liwu.</p>
<h3>Less Than Half of Elementary and Middle School Students in Peiping Have No Diseases</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The Peiping Education and Health Bureaus previously conducted a general check-up on elementary school students in this cultural city, proving that less than half of the students have no diseases. Among the diseases, trachoma is the most common, accounting for 19.9% of all students, the reason being that Peiping has a lot of wind and sand, and towels are used indiscriminately. The second most common is dental disease, the reason being eating too much sugar, and the third is malnutrition, accounting for 12.9%. The fourth is tonsillitis, accounting for 7%; and skin diseases account for 5.8%. The figures for lung diseases have not yet been compiled, but the proportion is said to be quite large. According to the Peiping municipal elementary and middle schools, there are few schools with sanitary facilities. Only schools with more than 500 students have a health room, and schools with more than 300 students have a nursing room, while those below have nothing.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Education in Guizhou: Guizhou Education Department Recently Reported to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Air Dispatch] The Guizhou Provincial Education Department recently submitted a general overview of education in the province to the Ministry of Education. The following is an excerpt of the overview:</p>
<h3>Medical College Is Planning to Merge into Guizhou University</h3>
<p>(A) Higher Education. The province's colleges above the associate degree level, the Provincial Medical College, has built five buildings, with a total of eight classes of students, 192 people. Since the financial system changed, the college's funding has been stretched. It is in discussions with Guizhou University to merge the college into Guizhou University. The Provincial Arts and other colleges have six classes of students, 176 people. The Guizhou Guilin Science Experiment Hall has been renamed the Guizhou Science Experiment Hall, and has purchased a large number of instruments to enrich its equipment. It continues to manufacture physics and chemistry instruments for primary and secondary schools. Recently, the hall will be merged with the Provincial Science Museum. In addition, Xijiang College has now been transferred to the province, and the private Southwest Business College has also resumed operations earlier.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Public and Private Middle Schools Reaches 185</h3>
<p>(B) Secondary Education. (1) The province's 18 middle schools have been restored. The 13 middle schools, including Binyang Junior Middle School, are repairing school buildings; the eight schools, including Baise Middle School, have added books, instruments, and sports and hygiene equipment; Liujiang County Middle School in the county district is being restored; Guilin City Middle School has not yet been restored due to lack of funds.

Currently, in the province's 12 normal school districts, Wuming and Qingyuan have not yet established provincial normal schools.</p>
<h3>"Donate a School for Longevity" Movement: Fundraising Extended for Another Year</h3>
<p>(C) National Education. There were originally 1,875 township center national schools, of which 1,783 have been restored. There were originally 18,864 village street national schools, of which 16,743 have been restored. Last year, a "Donate a School for Longevity" movement was launched in various counties and cities. Guo De, Yulin, and other counties donated more than 50 million yuan each. A small number of poor counties could not meet the predetermined standards, so the Education Department ordered the donation movement to be extended for another year to continue raising funds.</p>
<h3>Libraries and Art Museums: Increasing Buildings and Adding Equipment</h3>
<p>(D) Social Education. (1) The Provincial Guilin and Nanning Libraries have been restored earlier. The Guilin Library has built a new building and purchased more than 10,000 new books.

<h3>Father's Day Song Contest: Wei Bingxin Wins First Place</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Father's Day Promotion Committee publicly solicited Father's Day songs in newspapers. More than 1,000 people responded. After judging by education experts such as Du Zuozhou and Chen Heqin, it is reported that the first place winner is Wei Bingxin, a section chief of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education. The full text has been sent to the "Children's Story" monthly magazine published by the Children's Bookstore and will be published on the 8th of this month for reference. According to a judge, this is a good phenomenon of educators advocating civic education.</p>
<h3>National Construction School of Law and Commerce: Still Growing</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Ninghai Road in Nanjing is already a fairly quiet street, and turning north into Kuanglu Road is even more sparsely populated, like entering the countryside. This place, with fresh air and far from the noise of the city, is an excellent environment for studying. National Construction School of Law and Commerce stands in this ideal setting.</p>
<p>Speaking of the school's history, it is still very young, but it has already established six departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Business Administration, and Accounting and Banking, and is affiliated with the Land Administration Research Institute. The founders are Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Committee, and Xiao Zheng, the former Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. Xiao resigned from his position as Deputy Minister in order to devote himself to education. When the school held its opening ceremony last semester, he declared to the students very firmly: "I am running a school to cultivate real talents that society urgently needs. This school is not a diploma mill, so don't expect to be able to buy a diploma here with money..." After hearing this, some students were happy and some were sad, but I believe that the happy people will definitely be the majority, because in any school, bad students are ultimately very few, and most people hope to gain more real knowledge during the four years of university to lay the foundation for serving society in the future.</p>
<p>As proven by the facts of the past six months, President Xiao has not neglected his advocacy for a moment, which can be seen from the exams. The supervisors were extremely strict during the summer exams, and students who cheated were punished accordingly, some with demerits and some with expulsion. In fact, strict exams should be the minimum requirement for every school for students, because cheating in exams during student days fosters a mentality of speculation, which will easily lead to corruption and violations of the law when they enter society. In our country, where there are many out-of-school youth who cannot be accommodated by schools, it is better to grit your teeth and eliminate students who do not study and fool around in school, rather than tolerate evil, so as to leave space for young people who are willing to study. However, for anything, rewards and punishments must be used together to achieve greater results. National Construction School of Law and Commerce has established a reward method for students with excellent academic performance: those who have good conduct and a total average grade of 80 or above in the semester will be exempted from tuition fees for the next semester, those with 90 or above will be exempted from miscellaneous fees, and those with 95 or above will not pay any fees for the next semester (including all expenses such as meals and accommodation). This shows the school authorities' earnest expectations for young students. The professors hired are all authoritative scholars at home and abroad, such as Lin Bin, Yang Youjiong, Fu Tongxian, Lou Tongshen, Shou Miancheng, Ren Zhuoxuan, Tang Huisun, Bao Decheng, Wan Guoding, Mei Zhongxie, Zhang Pijie, Wu Shuchang, Fan Renyu, and Li Qinglin. Director of Academic Affairs Yang Youjiong is not only a domestic legal expert, but also was selected as one of the fourteen legal authorities in the world. The 1946 World Almanac has detailed records of his life and works. In order to improve students' English proficiency and increase opportunities for practical conversation practice, foreign professors will be hired next semester, and if necessary, the English learning time will be increased to ensure that everyone can actually apply it.</p>
<p>The guidance department adopts a laissez-faire system, only guiding or persuading students for inappropriate actions, and not resorting to rigid sanctions unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, the air in the school is very free, and wall newspapers are like bamboo shoots after rain, expressing their opinions and dazzling the eye. Invisibly, a atmosphere of mutual competition and unwillingness to lag behind has been cultivated in academic thought. The guidance office's implementation of this strategy has resulted in unexpected success.</p>
<p>We often see news in the newspapers about private schools requesting permission from the education authorities to increase tuition fees, and there was a time when the situation was serious and rumors of teacher strikes spread. National Construction College is not like this. On the contrary, they (the school authorities) are planning for students everywhere. Within the possible range, they will never increase fees. Taking tuition as an example, it was 300,000 yuan last semester, and it has been decided to maintain the original amount next semester. Everyone knows how crazy prices have risen in the past six months, but the tuition fee remains the same. Old students will only pay more than 500,000 yuan each next semester. This is indeed a very convenient over度given to the students by a school with no external financial aid.</p>
<p>Due to the surge in the number of students, the school buildings are insufficient. It is planned to complete a large auditorium and classrooms and dormitories that can accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 people during the summer vacation. Because according to the established plan, the college departments will be expanded, a graduate school will be added, and it will be reorganized into National Construction University. This summer's admissions will be held in both Beijing and Shanghai. The exams will be held on August 9th and 10th (the Shanghai office is located at the City Council on Tanggu Road in this city). Each department will enroll 50 new students, and it is expected that the number will increase by several hundred again next semester.</p>
<p>National Construction School of Law and Commerce, although still in the growth stage, shows that it has all the conditions for healthy development. We expect it to grow quickly, and perhaps in today's extremely poor educational world, we can see the brilliance of its efforts.</p>

<p>[Another Report] The university's School Affairs Maintenance Committee yesterday issued a notice to university students stating that all student organizations must resubmit application forms by the 5th of this month, which will be sent to the extracurricular activities group, then to the guidance group, and finally to the school committee for review, and also ordered that the student union not engage in external activities. University students expressed strong opposition to the various restrictions issued by the Reorganization Committee and the School Affairs Maintenance Committee. Slogans, announcements, and cartoons were again plastered all over the school yesterday.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Ping Department Professors Leave School; Unwilling to Accept Peking University Appointment Letters</h3>
<p>[Hualian News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] After the decision to transfer the Beiyang Ping Department to Peking University for takeover, professors have been leaving the school one after another, unwilling to accept Peking University appointment letters.

The Electrical Engineering Department has completely dissolved. Furthermore, the Beiyang University Student Protection Association issued a public notice yesterday stating: "Students of this association understand the difficult times and should not take opposing actions, which would only increase the government's difficulties. However, the prerequisite is to allow Beiyang students the freedom to transfer to Tianjin, fulfilling their long-held wish. It is hoped that both Beiyang and Peking University authorities will face the facts squarely and not allow the situation to worsen, creating major disputes."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office Assists Returning Overseas Chinese Students with Enrollment</h3>

<p>Soviet Union Wins Against Gube (Men)</p>
<p>The Fan Jiang team is the top-tier volleyball team in Shanghai, with extremely strong combat power. Chai Mielao and Jili Luwei's serves were like artillery shells, and the front row's blocking, the middle row's high-pressure spikes, were both heavy and fast. The Gube youngsters have an average age of only 19 years old, but they tried their best to fight and their unwavering spirit was admirable. Although they lost three games in a row, the audience still cheered enthusiastically. In the first game, the Soviet Union was forgiving, and Gube also fought hard to 21-14.

<h3>Industrial Association and Other Groups Fight for Quota Allocation Rights</h3>
<p>Decided to Submit Six Suggestions to the Central Authorities</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Industrial Association held a press conference at the Cishu Building Star Five Dinner Party at 3 pm yesterday to report on the industrial raw material quota allocation rights and the process of the review committee failing to reach an agreement due to the lack of sincerity of commercial trade associations. First, Tian Heqing, the executive director of the Industrial Association, reported the following four points of the industrial sector's opinions on the issue of industrial raw materials:</p>
<p>(1) Industrial essential raw materials should be directly allocated to factories to reduce the exploitation of middlemen at all levels, so as to increase production, reduce production costs, and curb and stabilize prices, and cooperate with national policies. At the same time, the foreign exchange paid by the government can be used to achieve the highest effect. (2) The goods ordered by importers are for the purpose of making huge profits, and do not fully meet the needs of the industrial sector. Direct access to raw materials by the industrial sector can eliminate black market malpractices. (3) The quota allocation office does not handle matters thoroughly, and the government's control policy is not thorough. (4) The industrial sector does not hope that the raw material import quota will increase quarter by quarter. On the contrary, it hopes that it will be reduced to stimulate domestic production of raw materials and establish necessary heavy industries.</p>
<p>Then, Pan Shihao, a director of the Industrial Association, reported the failure of the distribution review meeting, and the commercial trade association and the Export Control Commission quota allocation office should be held responsible. From April 24 to July 30, after 16 small group allocation meetings, the internal allocation of chemical raw materials, pigments, and hardware, the three most important items, by the industrial association has been successfully completed, but in the end, the commercial association refused to attend, resulting in the failure of the allocation agreement. The industrial sector is deeply saddened by this. The crux of the dispute is the irrationality of the government's foreign exchange policy and trade policy, which has caused friction between industry and commerce and disputes over the illegal profits of the black market foreign exchange. In the future, please ask the government to clearly define the boundaries and give the industrial sector the right to allocate quotas. The Industrial Association and the Industrial Trade Association will send more than a dozen representatives to Beijing this Wednesday to state their opinions. The Mechanical Industry Association, the Production Promotion Association, the National Goods Factory Federation, and the National Goods Production and Sales Association will also go to Beijing on the same day to state the opinions of the national goods merchants to the central authorities for opening up trade with Japan. The Industrial Association resolved to make six suggestions to the government:</p>
<p>(1) The Export Control Commission should announce in detail to which family the first phase of quotas was allocated and the amount of the quotas.</p>
<p>(2) For the second quarter's quota allocation rate, please ask the quota allocation office to first allocate the amount of raw materials that industry and commerce should import, and the Industrial Association will be responsible for negotiating the allocation. The allocation results should be reported to the quota allocation office for processing. Before the agreement is reached, no visas should be issued.</p>
<p>(3) Starting from the third quarter, the raw materials required by each factory should be requested by the quota allocation office to specify their types and values ​​and directly give them quota allocation rights. If the application industry is simple, it should be allocated by one industrial trade association. If the application industry is in two or more industries, it should first be handed over to the Industrial Association, which will be responsible for negotiating the allocation and reporting the allocation to the quota allocation office for approval.</p>
<p>(4) The factories in other cities should be handed over to the local industrial associations for allocation.</p>
<p>(5) When the raw materials imported under quota are not enough for three months of application, they can handle their own foreign exchange, or the foreign exchange earned from exports of each industry can be used for their own use.</p>
<p>(6) Please establish a special operating agency in the short term to supply the raw materials required by each industry.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Shanghai Industrial Association and all industrial trade associations in Shanghai also issued a declaration on the handling of raw materials imported under quota.</p>
<h3>Industrial Workers are Repaid with Rapeseed Oil</h3>
<p>This year, the rape seeds in Jiangnan are expected to have a bumper harvest. The various producing areas have already been listed on the market one after another. Experts in the industry estimate that the output will be more than 200,000 dan. Due to the recent authorities' implementation of the oil allocation work for industrial workers, soybeans are expensive, so rapeseed oil is used for allocation and sale. The China Trust Bureau, together with the oil pressing industry, is conducting purchases. It has now obtained a loan of 15 billion yuan and has successively purchased more than 60,000 dan of rapeseed. Half of it has been transported to Shanghai and handed over to various factories for oil pressing. The cost of each dan of rapeseed oil is as high as 880,000 yuan, but the oil allocation for industrial workers is still set at 4,500 yuan per catty. The oil pressing contract has been signed recently, stipulating that the China Trust Bureau will use 42 catties of rapeseed cake from each factory for each dan of rapeseed as oil pressing fees.</p>
<p>At present, the price of rapeseed oil in the market is lower than the cost of oil pressing by the China Trust Bureau, which is said to be caused by the following reasons: various oil pressing factories or vendors are familiar with the local purchase situation and absorb it at a low price. Commercial institutions are more efficient than government agencies. Manufacturers sell at a discount due to borrowing money. And in important producing areas such as Chongqing, the price of new products on the market has fallen a lot, which has affected the Tai city.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Bottle Factories Urge Self-Sufficiency in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of foreign exchange controls, the production of hot water bottle factories in this city has stagnated. The sale of hot water bottles produced by these factories to Hong Kong, the South Sea Islands, and other places accounts for 60% of their total production, with an estimated monthly export volume of over 20 billion. The current market price for a two-pound hot water bottle is 490,000 national currency per dozen. In Hong Kong, the selling price is over 70 Hong Kong dollars. Based on the black market exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars, exporters can still make a profit. However, if the government purchases foreign exchange at the official rate, the price of these goods would need to be 200 Hong Kong dollars upon arrival in Hong Kong, making them unsalable. As a result, exporters are hesitant, and manufacturers are suffering significant losses. All hot water bottle businesses in this city have appealed to relevant government agencies for assistance, requesting the opening of the Southeast Asian market and permission for self-sufficiency in foreign exchange. Despite multiple days passing, no official response has been received from the government. With the proposed opening of trade with Japan about to be implemented, our country's only market in Southeast Asia is in imminent danger. Therefore, hot water bottle businesses are preparing to make further appeals, hoping that the government will maintain the existing Southeast Asian market, comply with popular sentiment, and immediately liberalize foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Farmers Hold Business Symposium</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank operates agricultural loans, agricultural warehouses, and other businesses to serve the local area. It has 62 branches and offices throughout the province. To strengthen its operations, the head office convened a business symposium yesterday afternoon in Zhenjiang, bringing together responsible representatives from various branches and offices with heavy workloads throughout the province. Attendees included Liu Shixiu from Shanghai, Cao Tang from Suzhou, Jiang Jingzhai and Wang Liangfeng from Wuxi, Xie Zhaonan from Changzhou, Wei Jiaji from Zhenjiang, Lin Liming from Nanjing, Wang Jiansheng from Changshu, Cui Jiezhen from Xuzhou, She Wenbo from Yangzhou, Chen Xiaoci from Nantong, Liu Rentao from Taixian, Ji Kezong from Taixing, Li Xinlin from Xinghua, and senior officials from the head office. General Manager Dong Zhe chaired the meeting, outlining the principles to be emphasized in future operations and listening to reports from each branch and office. On the morning of the second day, representatives invited senior officials from the head office to a tea party at Riverside Park, exchanging opinions in an informal conversation. Starting at 10:00 AM, the meeting continued at the head office to discuss various proposals.</p>
<h3>After Factory Price Adjustment, "Guben" Soap Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for daily necessities also showed strength. The factory price for "Guben" soap was raised to 460,000, causing excitement in the market, with significant buying activity. Sporadic replenishments were also strong, and the asking price rose step by step from 475,000. The closing price at noon rose to 483,000, a sharp increase of 10,000 compared to the previous day. For "Arrow Knife" soap, the price for those holding warehouse receipts was 480,000, but the market price yesterday was only 475,000. Although it rose by 5,000, it still resulted in a loss of interest. Sales of other soaps, such as "Guanghua," "Niu Pai," and "Riyue," were also good, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 5,000, but "Huang Xiangmao" saw a flat result.</p>
<p>The match market saw increased activity. "Meili" brand increased by 40,000 per box, to 3,160,000, and "Fenghuang" brand also rose by 10,000, to 3,110,000. Other brands, such as "Laohu," "Nanjing," and "Ningbo," also saw significant price increases due to strong customer demand.</p>
<p>The kerosene market remained firm. "Gaodu" barrel goods traded at 830,000 to 840,000. American half-pint cans were priced at 127,000 to 128,000, while Asian companies quoted 121,000 to 126,000.</p>
<p>The candle market remained strong due to high raw material costs. "Baili" brand rose to 500,000 per box, "Sengmao" to 550,000, and "Ji Pai" to 400,000. However, trading was mediocre due to the hot weather.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Sentiment Firm and Buoyant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market saw that the delivery of goods from Yong Tai He was not yet complete, and demand from other businesses remained strong. Retail outlets were active, frequently replenishing their stocks. The market still lacked sufficient supply, and trading sentiment was strong. The market trended upward in a winding manner, becoming even stronger at noon. "Ten-Stick British" cigarettes rose to 9,470,000, with buyers stepping in, resulting in a rebound of 130,000 compared to the previous day. "Laodao" cigarettes also rose to 7,430,000, with transactions occurring, showing an increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>"Wuhua Hademen" cigarettes maintained good momentum, and prices were also firm. Other cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers showed mixed results, fluctuating between 300 and 500. However, "Jinshu Pai" cigarettes saw a significant price drop, falling by 700 per pack, due to rumors that Huacheng Company would be arranging for delivery of goods soon. American cigarettes, such as "Six-Pack Camel" and "Malis" cigarettes, and 50-stick canned cigarettes, such as "Qialike," "Sanwu," and "Shuishou," saw weakening market trends due to sluggish sales.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Detailed Report Released by the Farmers Bank</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Regarding the general situation of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, loan comparisons, and increased production, the Chinese Farmers Bank released detailed information as follows:</p>
<p>This spring, approximately 1.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs were distributed, including local varieties. With an average of two sheets of silkworm eggs raised per household, there were approximately 750,000 silkworm farmers, producing a total of approximately 280,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Among them, more than 70,000 could be reeled into more than 200,000 dan of local silk. The bank has provided loans for manufacturers to reel the silk, which will be handed over to the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee for export. Calculated at 1.2 million per dan of fresh cocoons, the total value is approximately 336 billion. In other words, each silkworm farming household can earn an average income of 448,000 within one month. This is beneficial for guiding idle funds into the right track and revitalizing the rural economy. Considering that the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang accounts for half of the total national output and suffered severe damage during the anti-Japanese war, the bank intends to revive and increase production after the victory by providing loans for the silkworm and mulberry industry. The following are some of the achievements:</p>
<p>(1) Mulberry Seedling Loans: In 1946, 36 cooperative societies in Haining, Chongde, Tongxiang, and Hangxian counties of Zhejiang Province, including 2,711 member households, increased planting by 2,506.08 mu, with loans totaling 62,341,750. This year, continued loans for transplanting and grafting mulberry seedlings amounted to 318,417,250, resulting in 2 million grafted seedlings and 125 million one-year-old seedlings, sufficient to supply one-fourth of the materials needed for the restoration of mulberry gardens in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(2) Seed Production Loans: In the spring of 1946, 946,000,000 was lent to 45 seed production farms in Zhejiang Province and 104 seed production farms in Jiangsu Province. This year, after review by the relevant authorities, slightly eliminating some, 97 farms in Jiangsu and 41 in Zhejiang were qualified, with loans totaling 6,380,000,000. This will enable the production of more than one million improved silkworm egg sheets, which will be promoted to silkworm farmers at reasonable prices. In particular, the increase in new varieties is significant, and it is expected that the use of improved silkworm eggs will reach more than 59% next spring.</p>
<p>(3) Silkworm Raising Loans: There are 254 cooperative societies in Zhejiang, including 20,663 households, and 108 societies in Jiangsu, including 23,197 households, with total loans of 565,000,000. 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were raised. This year, there are 533 societies in Zhejiang, with 59,699 households, and 165 societies in Jiangsu, with 4,526 households, with loans totaling 5,381,000,000. 320,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were raised. In addition, the number of organizations and participating households has increased, accounting for about 14% of all silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>(4) Cooperative Dried Cocoon Loans: Last year, 1,129 dan were from Zhejiang Province and 1,545 dan from Jiangsu Province, with loans of 1,443,000,000. This year, 2,705 were from Zhejiang and 3,230 dan from Jiangsu, with loans of 21,981,000,000. The quantity has clearly doubled.</p>
<p>(5) Fresh Cocoon Purchase Loans: Last year, the Spring Silkworm Syndicate lent a total of 16.9 billion to 54 manufacturers, purchasing 143,782 market dan of cocoons. Subsequently, the bank provided loans of 10.5 billion to 47 manufacturers for autumn cocoons, purchasing 35,292 market dan of autumn cocoons, and 4,956 dan of spring dried cocoons. This spring, loans of 235.4 billion were lent to 70 manufacturers, purchasing more than 200,000 dan of spring cocoons. Last year, the government purchased only 6,472 customs dan of raw silk, and this year it is expected to purchase 14,000 customs dan.</p>
<p>(6) Exported Local Silk Mortgage Loans: In the Gan Jing (i.e., exported local silk) silk area, as it gradually transforms into a cocoon area, temporary mortgage loans of 1.5 billion were provided. Currently, 6,322 vehicles of raw silk have been mortgaged, reducing the local interest rate from 34 to 20, alleviating the burden of high-interest loans on silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>(7) New-Style Reeling Machine Loans: Last year, a loan of 150 million was provided to the Hu Xu Women's Silk School, resulting in the completion of 120 new-style reeling machines for a silk reeling factory, which are now in operation. Approximately 140 dan of raw silk are reeled on behalf of five cooperative societies in Wujiang and other areas of Suzhou, to be provided for government purchase.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Transports Chinese Cotton; 100,000 More Bales to Arrive</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The total amount of cotton transported to China by UNRRA this year has reached 200,000 bales. Of these, 132,452 bales have arrived at the port. The total amount that has been allocated and sold to textile mills by UNRRA is 61,484 bales, leaving a remaining balance of 70,968 bales. About 40,000 bales have been contracted for sale with the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association and will be delivered in the near future. UNRRA plans to sell approximately 100,000 bales to textile mills within the year. These will be shipped from the United States to China in the near future. The American cotton that UNRRA plans to sell to the 31 member textile mills of the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association will be exchanged for 34,837 pieces of cotton yarn, each weighing 400 pounds, to be delivered in four installments. UNRRA is currently discussing with the Joint Relief Agency the issue of the future sale of this batch of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchant Groups Appeal for Exemption from Business Tax on the Grain Industry</h3>
<p>The exemption period for the business tax on the grain industry for various grain merchant groups in this city is about to expire. Representatives were previously sent to Nanjing, together with the joint association of chambers of commerce from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and representatives from grain merchant groups in Nanjing and Hangzhou, to petition the central government for continued exemption. Many days have passed, but no clear written order has been received from the central government. The Rice Commercial Association, Miscellaneous Grain Commercial Association, and Flour Bran Commercial Association, three trade associations of grain merchants in this city, jointly sent a telegram yesterday to Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, appealing for them to urge the central government to issue an order for continued exemption as soon as possible, to appease their hopes.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Key Commodity Market Prices in This City Over the Past Week (Rise x Fall)</h3>
<h3>Focus on Developing Agriculture: Highlights of the Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Interview with Mr. Lou Tongsun by Our Newspaper's Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] After the "Economic Reform Plan" was passed by the State Council, our reporter interviewed Mr. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, to inquire about his views on the plan. As a member of the Central Committee, he contributed many opinions during the Third Plenary Session's discussion of the "Economic Reform Plan." He also participated throughout the National Economic Commission's discussion of the plan, making him most familiar with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Lou attached great importance to this plan, comparing it to our country's "Economic Magna Carta." He stated that our country produced two major charters this year: the "Constitution of the Republic of China," promulgated on New Year's Day, and the "Economic Charter," passed by the State Council on August 1. The latter is based in principle on Section 3 of Chapter 13 of the former, "National Economy." Therefore, it focuses on the national economy in every aspect, paying particular attention to farmers and agriculture. Article 146 of the Constitution stipulates that "The State should use scientific technology... to promote the industrialization of agriculture," and the preamble of the plan also states, "How to make an agricultural country trend towards industrialization is the most important task for national construction in the future." This shows that the latter is truly an embodiment of the former.</p>
<p>Agriculture-Based Plan</p>
<p>The Economic Reform Plan attaches such importance to farmers and agriculture that it can also be called the "Agriculture-Based Plan." Mr. Lou pointed out that in terms of economic nature and environment, China is truly an agricultural economy country. The lifestyle and ideology of the Chinese people have not yet completely broken away from this category. Therefore, the most important significance of this plan is to restore the rightful position of the vast number of farmers and rural areas, and to seek a way out for them. This is not only detailed in the "Agriculture" chapter, but the "Industry" chapter also stipulates that "China's economy is based on agriculture. Therefore, without a self-sufficient people's industry to protect agriculture and enable the exchange of agricultural and industrial economy, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established." The first article of that chapter stipulates that "Industry should first adapt to the needs of rural areas." The preamble also mentions that future policies should start from utilizing the capabilities of the majority of the people, so that the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people can support the entire country's finances. All of this illustrates that the Economic Reform Plan focuses on the agricultural economy, aiming to modernize China's agriculture and then promote industrial modernization.</p>
<p>Importance of County Banks</p>
<p>County banks bear the heaviest responsibility in developing the rural economy. Mr. Lou pointed out that the county banks referred to in the Economic Reform Plan are not the county banks stipulated in the current Banking Law, but the county banks after thorough reconstruction in the future. Separate laws will be enacted in the future to specify them in detail.</p>
<p>The main business of county banks is to "develop the rural economy, facilitate local construction, and cooperate with the implementation of local autonomy." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will stated that counties should be politically and economically autonomous. Political autonomy means achieving a truly democratic foundation, while economic autonomy means seeking self-sufficiency in the economy. If all counties in the country can become "autonomous bodies" politically and economically, then all counties will become what Mr. Sun Yat-sen called "the cornerstone of national construction." If a country has thousands of cornerstones, it will not be difficult to achieve prosperity and happiness. This is the guiding principle of this chapter.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the establishment of county banks should be based on the principle of one bank per county. However, it does not stipulate that all counties must establish banks simultaneously, but rather depends on local needs, economic conditions, and the degree of autonomy implementation. Since county banks mainly cooperate with local autonomy, they are essentially a type of "autonomous bank," in opposition to national banks, just as the financial revenue and expenditure system is divided into national finance and local finance. The plan stipulates that county banks should be invested in by the Central Bank and provincial banks as initiating shares and stipulates that "County banks should be assisted by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on their business categories and needs." This provision is due to the fact that China has too many counties, and the business of county banks may not easily develop in the early stages. Therefore, a parent bank is needed to support them. However, the central meaning of the plan is currently focused on agriculture, and Mr. Lou believes that it is best to use the branches of the China Farmers Bank in various places as the superior banks of the county banks.</p>
<p>Some people believe that after each county establishes a county bank, the state will be unable to bear the burden, and the currency will inflate accordingly. Mr. Lou does not think so, pointing out that modern banks have evolved in nature compared to past banks. Today's banks, in terms of their business, are not only limited to gathering capital, establishing credit, investing in production and profit-making businesses, and absorbing deposits, etc., but have evolved to a new stage, where their main function is "clearing." Under this new concept, only county banks are true financial entities, similar to how autonomous counties are entities in the political hierarchy. Therefore, the fact that county banks have the China Farmers Bank, etc., as their superior banks is the same as having a provincial level in politics. Both are "virtual settings," and their role is to connect them.</p>
<p>When the National Economic Commission discussed this issue, some members emphasized the importance of the province, believing that the province is a real autonomous province and emphasizing the importance of provincial banks. This opinion has a considerable basis in the Constitution, and Mr. Lou also expressed considerable agreement with it. However, he believes that the current political system in China, the administrative hierarchy, and the differentiation of administrative regions will be greatly adjusted after the country is stable. Therefore, the economic problems of county banks (which are permanent problems) cannot be compared with the current provincial system (which is not absolutely certain). By extension, the arguments for emphasizing the position of provincial banks are also insufficient. Although the plan still has provisions for provincial banks, they cannot be regarded as the superior banks of county banks in the future. At the same time, the establishment of branches of provincial banks is limited to "important political and economic centers in the province" and cannot be universally established. This should be specially mentioned.</p>
<p>Need International Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Lou continued to point out that since China is an agricultural country, to make this vast agricultural country with its large population move towards industrialization, in addition to its own efforts, it needs international mutual assistance and aid to achieve industrialization as soon as possible. The plan has repeatedly mentioned this point. The preamble clarifies: "Welcome foreign capital and technical talents with preferential terms to achieve the goal of industrialization." Article 13 of the Industry Chapter stipulates: "To promote the development of industry, the government should clearly stipulate measures to encourage foreign investment and technical cooperation." Article 5 of the Chapter on Increasing Production and Stabilizing Prices also stipulates: "The government should negotiate loans for machinery and raw materials from foreign countries on preferential terms to increase the supply of materials." Mr. Lou emphasized that China's economic progress is very important for world peace. Because if China's economy is not industrialized, it will not be able to completely break away from international economic aggression and will continue to be the object of international commercial competition. This situation is enough to cause unrest in the world. It is hoped that the international community, especially the United States, can sympathize with, consider, and thoroughly recognize this point. (Note: Our government has always welcomed foreign investment in China. The Executive Yuan sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart on July 30, stating that we do not discriminate against foreign businesses and welcome American businesses to invest in state-owned and private industries.)</p>
<p>Some foreigners criticize our government for not using private deposits abroad. Mr. Lou believes that the Economic Reform Plan has detailed provisions for the use of private deposits abroad and cannot say that the government will not use such deposits forever. He pointed out that Article 9 of the Industry Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "The government should organize and promote the establishment of investment companies for various industrial and mining construction projects, invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in this organization to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad." Article 6 of the Chapter on Finance and Stabilizing the Currency Value also stipulates: "Citizens' assets abroad should be reported within a limited time and used appropriately."</p>
<p>When the National Economic Commission discussed this issue, some people outside believed that this was not easy to do. Because British and American laws do not allow the names of depositors to be disclosed to others. Mr. Lou believes that the reason why the current plan still stipulates this is similar to "wanted on file" in criminal law. The purpose is to alert the adults and gentlemen who have private deposits overseas and at least achieve a moral purpose. In fact, the government may not be able to take other effective steps in the future.</p>
<p>Linked Import and Export Measures</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Commercial Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "Export business should be actively encouraged. The government can purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to implement linked import and export measures to increase exports to offset imports." This is the linked import and export measure that is most criticized by all parties. This measure evolved from the "linked import and export measure." After the Shanghai side proposed the linked import and export measure, the former Economic Policy Committee discussed it several times and had heated debates. The competent authorities strongly opposed it. Mr. Lou was also one of the participants in the discussion at the time and argued with reason. He believed that the implementation of linked import and export would definitely stimulate exports and then stimulate production, which would greatly help the prosperity of agriculture. The representatives of the Central Bank, etc., at the time also had to admit this. The current linked import and export measure is only a kind of vertical linkage, and its linkage is limited to the linkage of several types of "main industries," such as yarn and silk cotton. After shipping yarn and cloth for export, cotton is purchased with the foreign exchange earned itself. This is very different from the previously proposed linked import and export measure. Mr. Lou believes that it is regrettable that the plan failed to include the linked measure.</p>
<p>Start with Hard Work in Production</p>
<p>The conclusion of the plan quoted Confucius's saying: "When those who produce are many, and those who eat are few; when those who do work are quick, and those who use things are slow, then wealth will always be sufficient." Mr. Lou said that if the above words are expressed in modern terms, it means that everyone should work more and produce more. China's economy is so backward and has been destroyed for a long time. People should tighten their belts, work hard, and do practical work. All kinds of behaviors that are contrary to this cannot be called economic reform. Article 14 of the Industry Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "Wages should be reasonable to seek the stability of production order, so that labor and management can work together to increase production." This provision clearly shows the following points: first, current wages are not reasonable; second, the order of production has not yet stabilized. Labor-management cooperation and increased production can be discussed only after wages are reasonable and the order of production is stable. Mr. Lou solemnly pointed out that due to the special economic structure of China, a phenomenon of urban exploitation of rural areas has been formed, resulting in better treatment for producers and workers than for farmers. During this mobilization period, it is hoped that the labor comrades can deeply understand the meaning, work more, and produce more. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that "coordination of social and economic interests," and the intention of Article 14 is also the same.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mr. Lou's conclusion on the Economic Reform Plan is: The plan itself is divided into three main parts: "Production and Construction" is the center of this plan, which is a dynamic plan and needs to be initiated through multi-faceted efforts. "Financial System" is a static plan. Once decided, it must be implemented for a period of time. "Finance" is the link between finance and production, and it is closely related to detailed machinery. After its adjustment, production can be more developed, and finance can also fulfill its functions. The plan says: "Production business cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and financial revenue cannot be without the support of production business for a day. Financial policy, economic policy and fiscal policy are mutually causal, complementary and indispensable," which is what it means.</p>
<p>From a formal point of view, the amended plan is more concise than the original plan, but in essence, it is not without discrepancies with the original intention. As for the future implementation steps, it still needs to be studied and stipulated in detail, which is similar to the situation after the promulgation of the Constitution and the need to formulate ten constitutional regulations.</p>

<p>This column answers: There are no so-called night universities in Shanghai. The Soochow University Law School has classes from 7 pm to 9 pm, and its academic qualifications are exactly the same as those of ordinary universities. The research department of the China Journalism College also has evening classes.</p>
<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>[Regulations] (1) This column is published every Monday and is answered by the Public Service Team of the Post Office. (2) Letters to this column are limited to questions from various postal departments that are related to the public. (3) Please indicate "Postal Affairs" in the upper left corner of the envelope to avoid postage. (4) Letters should be sent to the Public Service Team of the Shanghai Postal Administration or forwarded through the "Social Service" section of this newspaper.</p>
<p>This bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Wang Zhixiao of Dasheng Hardware Store, (2) Mr. Huang Zuxian of East Sports Association Road, (3) Mr. Kong Changsheng of North Henan Road, (4) Mr. Wang Yiming of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, (5) Mr. Gu Jikang of the Hangzhou Xiyuan Cafe, (6) Mr. Jiang Yan of Xinchang Road, and (7) Mr. Xiao Huizhong of South Zhejiang Road. Specific answers to the points raised are as follows:</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) A. First fill out the parcel detail form, hand the parcel to the customs stationed at the bureau for inspection, then weigh it and pay the fee, and the post office will issue a receipt as proof. B. Parcels sent to Changde are sent via Hankou and Changsha. Between Shanghai and Hankou, they are transported by Yangtze River ships, which takes about six to eight days. Between Hankou and Changsha, they are transported by the Yuehan Railway, which takes about two to three days. From Changsha to Changde, they are transported by small boats, which takes about five to eight days. C. The cost of sending a parcel to Changde is 6,800 yuan per kilogram.</p>
<p>(2) A. If a postal item sent to Hanjiang, Fujian, can match the Shanghai-Fuzhou flight schedule, it will arrive in about three to four days. Express mail is faster than ordinary mail, and airmail is also faster, but the degree of speed depends on local conditions and cannot be generalized. B. During periods when flights are suspended, mail to Fuzhou is transported by ship, and sometimes the arrival speed is calculated by shipping to Xiamen for transfer. However, the line has resumed flights. C. Shanghai-Fuzhou flights operate every Monday, Thursday, and Friday, while Fuzhou-Shanghai flights operate every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p>
<p>(3) A. Mail sent from Shanghai to Xinfeng will arrive in about one day. B. Direct, does not go through Zhenjiang transfer. C. After arriving in Xinfeng, if it can connect with the walking messenger schedule, it can be delivered to the countryside on the same day. D. Postmen do not charge for delivery.</p>
<p>(4) A. Mail service has resumed, but mail to Japan is limited to ordinary letters and postcards. B. This bureau's international money order service has not yet resumed, so remittances to Japan cannot be processed. C. Books are not accepted for posting at this time.</p>
<p>(5) A. In addition to postcards, ordinary letters can be sent to Japan. B. Cannot be registered or express. C. Currently in contact with Northwest Airlines. D. Ordinary mail matching the shipping schedule (about two or three times a month) takes about three to four days to arrive.</p>
<p>(6) East of Hongqiao in Hongkou, near Seward Road, there is Yuanchang Road, Yuanchang Lane. The Yuanchang Road, Yuanchang Lane you mentioned may be a mistake for this.</p>
<p>(7) The postal kiosk in front of the Golden Grand Theater you mentioned is only a few steps away from the Eight Immortals Bridge branch, so there seems to be no need to add another one. The suggestion to move it to the front of the Huangpu Branch is well-intentioned. However, this bureau's Eight Immortals Bridge branch is small, and the surrounding residents are concentrated, making it extremely crowded. The public often sends letters requesting improvements. This bureau once planned to add another floor to the building, but it did not happen due to some reason. Establishing a postal kiosk nearby is to reduce the congestion in that branch.</p>

<h3>Clipped Prose</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>Preface to My "Maple Leaf Collection"</p>
<p>Tonight, there are no stars adorning the blue sky; the twilight is sadly weeping. Is it the night wind swirling fallen leaves in moans? … Again, I am accompanied by paste and scissors under the lamp, filled with sorrow and longing, as the long night rushes toward dawn in the ticking of the clock.</p>
<p>"Only a true life can reveal the true meaning of life." Li Baifeng's realistic nightmare makes me clench my fist, and the blood flows hotly. I think: "Looking through the records of the lives of the majority of people should also be a way to understand the true meaning of the lives of people in this era." Therefore, my clippings chose prose. These are difficult and tearful times, with countless people sinking and floating in seas of tears and oceans of blood; but their records have the significance of autumn red leaves struggling against the west wind. Therefore, my clippings collection is titled "Maple Leaf."</p>
<p>Prose is the most filled with sincere emotions. Lyric prose makes me know longing; descriptive prose makes me contemplate; and prose full of the radiance of life makes me want to sing loudly on the mountain top when the morning sun rises.</p>
<p>The works in "Maple Leaf Collection" are all my favorites; Ye Dingluo's "Random Memories of Tong Window" and Hong Weifa's "Yangzhou Continued Dream" both make me love them so much that I can't bear to let them go because their words are filled with either the northern mood of "when the yellow wind blows, the wind swirls the sand, covering the sky, filling the streets, and white, colorless people struggle in the sand..." or the beauty of "billions of cherry blossoms blooming, becoming a pink mist..." and "Yellow River" and "Waves of Gulangyu" give people a sense of being there. Hong Weifa's "Guanyin Temple Fair" and "Guangling Flower Society"... give people a faint bitter taste, like drinking a cup of strong black tea.</p>
<p>In addition to these few continuous ones, the prose with one or two-character titles in the "Spring and Autumn" column of Shen Bao is also my favorite. Like "Window", "Palace Lantern", "Candlelight", "Sail", "Dove Bell"... youthful and active, they can truly serve as models for junior high school composition.</p>
<p>The editor of "Spring and Autumn" is Mr. Wang Jinshan, and he is probably a person who loves truth, goodness, and beauty, so the prose in "Spring and Autumn" has a characteristic: the goodness of the subject matter, the truth of the author's emotions, and the beauty of the words. Like many bright little red flowers scattered in valleys and plains.</p>
<p>Ta Kung Pao's "Literature and Art" also has a lot of prose, but the temperament of these prose has become more tough. Like wild sunflowers, an unyielding heart faces the sun in the midst of storms. Like Jiang Yuan's "Oath", "Our Dream White Skeletons", and other authors' "Small Harbor", "City", "Outside the Window"... and similarly, the now-defunct United Evening News's "Evening Gleanings" and Wenhui Bao's "Pen Society" also have a lot of prose, each with its own unique style. Looking at the prose clipped from these supplements today, I can't help but silently say, "I can't forget..." "Laughter and Tears", "Fire", "Who Exactly Deceived You"...</p>
<p>I know several of the authors in "Maple Leaf", but the torrent of time has scattered us so that we are no longer familiar. Sometimes we can still meet, but other times we can only face these articles alone in the quiet night, using the green lamp to bless them, to bless these people who are trekking through the desolate mountains and remote fields of this troubled land with health!</p>
<p>I clipped newspapers strewn all over the floor, and I don't know how many cold and dark nights I spent; I actually accumulated more than two hundred articles that I liked. During the day, when the songs of wild geese are loud, I browse through them, and often I read them in the season when swallows return from the south. Therefore, I am familiar with many unfamiliar writers, their names, and personalities, as if they were old friends.</p>
<p>Do you also like to clip some of your favorite works? I recommend you—prose is the most emotional thing!</p>
<p>Note: This manuscript has been received for a long time, and whether to publish it has always been under consideration. The reason for not publishing it is very simple because the content talks about this publication, which inevitably has the suspicion of self-promotion. The reason for publishing it is that it not only talks about this publication but also talks about the supplements of several other newspapers, and also lists many articles and catalogs; in addition, the author also uses personal experience to introduce readers to a method of reading supplements and clipping newspapers. Therefore, I feel that this article can not only give many contributors to various newspaper supplements some , but also give readers who love to read supplements a methodological reference. Therefore, it is published today at the beginning of the month as a reader's opinion. As for whether the editors of this publication "love truth, goodness, and beauty" and other issues, it is just like saying whether Su Shi has "a bellyful of untimely things", and it seems unnecessary to pay too much attention in this hot weather.

<h3>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h3>
<p>— Li Zhi</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>At these times, I always feel the agitation of day, so I love the tranquility of midnight.</p>
<p>In the midnight, I can't hear dogs barking, I can't hear the sounds of soldiers, and only when everything is asleep and I alone am awake is this realm the most lovely. Unlike the expanse of day, at this time, the night turns the surroundings into rivers and then into the sea, seeming to be boundlessly without shore. Nothing obstructs my vision, blocking my desires, at this time everyone will be so free, so comfortable, feeling that between heaven and earth, I am a glorious and delightful existence.</p>
<p>People are always fond of dreaming, but when you are alone and awake at midnight, isn't it a deep night realm, where you can put aside the faces you don't want to see, where you can stay away from the daily struggles of firewood and rice, and create in your own world? Unleash as much talent as you have, unfolding the future in the dimming light, trimming a flower, managing a desire, and the most clumsy of simpletons will become a talented expert when they are awake alone.</p>
<p>Originally, people's talents are the same, but people's misfortunes cause them to have different environments and different encounters, so some people can't straighten their backs, and some people bend over, which is a tragic tragedy. But on this fine night, unload the burden of reality, and let yourself fly in the free world, in the dream world, although you can't help each other in times of need, adding two wings, it is still good to be able to find a moment of peace and let your soul flap its wings and soar for a while.</p>
<p>Now I like midnight, especially in this midsummer, without steep , without worrying about , and perhaps a gentle breeze will blow, and I will feel a sense of refreshing joy. If there is still a heaven and a blessed land in this world, then it is the midsummer midnight.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>When I am near this lonely riverside, I don't want to imagine the hustle and bustle and the disputes that were here a few hours ago. I also try my best to avoid an imagination that someone once bid farewell to the world here with his ideals and despair, like Qu Yuan three thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Time passes like this, never ceasing day and night, and the river's flow is just like the torrent of history, going only forward and never returning, the same way thousands of years ago and the same way thousands of years later, murmuring and whispering away. The night gives it more energy and more words, but what can I say to it?</p>
<p>Tonight the breeze is gentle and the stars are all over the sky. Everyone should be looking for their own dreams. They may be crying, they may be laughing. And am I not enough to appreciate this ? Taking such a summer night as a dream, I have become the master of this dream.</p>
<p>There is nothing more vivid than such a midsummer night's dream. The river flows under my feet, the lights remain in the heart of the river, and the sky is full of shining stars. I feel that my feet are stronger and my wisdom is brighter. I really want to go into the water to search for the stars in the reflection. Aren't they the best jewels and the brightest eyes? If this is wealth, then there is no wealth more precious than this!</p>
<p>Now, I want to walk into the distance of the night. What is there in the distance of the night? Is it possible to find the end of the night, and let me wander around the edge for a week, and between dawn and the long night, can't I see the magnificent , comparing the good and bad of the two? What can be doubted? Midnight is like a blank sheet of paper, let me wander in the distance of the night and become a poet, and also become a master. Maybe I can write a chapter of immortal poetry with genius, maybe I can paint an amazing masterpiece!</p>
<p>In this way, like Shakespeare, let the Midsummer Night's Dream also leave a colorful shadow on this barren land.</p>
<h3>"The Crime Committed at the East Window" Novel</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhen</p>
<p>Novel Jottings</p>
<p>In Ms. Feng Yuanjun's recently published "Collection of Ancient Drama Theories", it says in "Postscript to the Four Studies of Ancient Drama": "Why do playwrights sometimes also write novels, such as Jin Renjie (Note 69)." (Page 52) The note says: "Jin Renjie is the author of 'Zhou Gongdan Holds the Child and Sets Up the Court', but he also wrote novels, see Lang Ying's 'Seven Categories of Drafts'." (Page 92) But this conclusion is difficult to believe because Lang Ying's words are not reliable.</p>
<p>The words of Lang Ying that the author is based on are found in Volume 23 of "Seven Categories of Drafts," in the section "The Crime Committed at the East Window." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Yue Wumu drama, He Li , all the world assumes it is a hypothetical matter, but it is to redress Wumu's grievances. I once saw Yuan's Kong Wenqing of Pingyang had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' Yuefu, Jin Renjie of Hangzhou had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' novel, and Zhang Guangbi of Luling had a 'Immortal in Straw Cloak' poem. I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel, but they are roughly similar to what is currently transmitted. Zhang's poem has a preface saying: 'Song Yacha He Li, the Grand Tutor Qin sent to the First Peak in the Southeast to hook , and a daze of people led him to the underworld, where he saw Qin confront Yue. He ordered to go back and tell his wife that the crime at the East Window had been committed. Afterwards, he abandoned his official post and learned the Tao, and his remains are now at the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, being the Immortal in Straw Cloak.' Based on this, it can be known that several people have declared that this matter exists. Otherwise, why should his descendants be Qing blind for generations, and Luo Rujie's son could not get up after bowing to the Yue Temple in Ezhou? Isn't that proof? So great and magnificent, such a major event, will there be no retribution? If the 'Yi Jian Zhi' records that He Xian has no Yacha, it is feared that it has been omitted."</p>
<p>Qing Chu Renhuo's "Jian Tian Ji" Volume 4 also has the same record. The original text first quotes "Yi Jian Zhi", and then says:</p>
<p>"The 'Jianghu Miscellaneous Records' record: After Hui killed Wumu, he prayed at Lingyin Temple. A monk garbled a verse knowing that Qin lived there. The monk wrote a poem with the line, 'The Chancellor asks me where I am going, my home is on the First Mountain in the Southeast.' Hui ordered He Li to seek it. Li came to a palace and saw a monk sitting in judgment. Li asked the attendants, who replied: 'The Bodhisattva of the Earth judges Qin Hui for killing Yue Fei.' After a while, several soldiers brought Hui in, wearing forged shackles, his face covered in dirt. Upon seeing Li, he called out: 'Tell my wife, the crime at the East Window has been committed!' 'Seven Categories of Drafts' also records: Yuan Kong Wenzhong of Pingyang had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' Yuefu, Jin Renjie of Hangzhou had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' novel, and Zhang Guangbi of Luling had a 'Immortal in Straw Cloak' poem. I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel, but they are roughly similar to what is transmitted in the world. The poem has a preface saying: 'Song Yacha He Li, the Grand Tutor sent to the First Peak in the Southeast , a daze of people led him to the underworld, where he saw Hui confront Yue. He ordered to tell his wife that the crime at the East Window had been committed. After returning, he abandoned his official post and learned the Tao, and his remains are now at the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, being the Immortal in Straw Cloak.' Based on these statements, it can be known that this matter actually happened on that day, not just a hypothesis to redress Wumu's grievances."</p>
<p>Comparing the two, "Jian Tian Ji" clearly copied , and deliberately changed the text and mistakenly called Wenqing Wenzhong. "Jian Tian Ji" is indirect secondhand material and is therefore unreliable; even the "direct historical material" "Seven Categories of Drafts" is equally unreliable. Lang Ying was a person in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, and Cheng also lived in the Wanli period, which was far from the Yuan Dynasty. What he said may not have strong evidence; and he himself clearly said, "I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel." When he wrote the book, he relied on the memory of "having seen" it, and did not compare books, even not seeing the Yuan Zaju drama, and only relying on the song titles. His basis was probably Yuan Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts."</p>
<p>According to "Record of Ghosts," Kong Wenqing is listed on the top volume, and Jin Renjie is listed on the bottom volume. Kong Wenqing's entry says, "Person from Pingyang," and lists "Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window," and also notes, "Also said to be written by Yang Juer." The title of the old Ge Manuscript collection of Tianyige is properly named: "The Bodhisattva of the Earth Witnesses the Crime Committed at the East Window," "He Zongli as the West Mountain Pilgrim." Jin Renjie's name has a brief biography, saying that he was a person from Hangzhou, and was appointed an official of the Jiankang Chongmi Office. He died in the second year of the Tianli reign (1329). It also lists seven dramas such as "Cai Yan Returns to Court," and "Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window" (the Ming manuscript does not have the three words "Qin Taishi") is also among them. The Ming manuscript notes "Two Versions" under Kong's version, and "Second Version" under Jin's version. The Ming Zhu Quan's "Taiping Zhengyinpu" also notes "Two Versions" under each version. Those noted as "Two Versions" or "Second Version" are said to mean that the two authors each wrote a Zaju drama with the same name, which was a Yuan drama convention. Looking at it this way, Jin Renjie's "Crime Committed at the East Window" is clearly a Zaju drama, not a novel. "Record of Ghosts" has Zhong Sicheng's eulogy of Lingbo Xian for Jin Renjie, which does not say that he authored a novel. Jia Zhongming's eulogy of Kong Wenqing, attached to the Ming manuscript, says:</p>
<p>The gentleman was like a grandson of the sage's gate, analyzing and living in a simple leaf divided. Eager to learn and not ashamed to ask those of high ability, he is worthy of the title "Wen". He often had Dao Hongren in his writings. He twirls "The Crime Committed at the East Window," which is the old version of West Lake, clarifying good and evil and persuading the turbulent people.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to note the sentence "Twirls 'The Crime Committed at the East Window'". Kong Wenqing was an early author of Yuan Zaju drama, while Jin Renjie was a mid-period figure, slightly later than Kong. Jin was a person from Hangzhou, and his Zaju drama was performed in Hangzhou, which is "the West Lake version." Kong's work was earlier, and was an old version before Jin's version, so Jia Zhongming said that the one he wrote, "is the old version of West Lake." This firm evidence proves even more that Jin Renjie's version was also a Zaju drama. The currently popular Jingyin "Thirty Yuan Drama," has a copy of "The Crime Committed at the East Window," which does not have the name of the author, but his title is the same as that of the Ming manuscript "Record of Ghosts," which is Kong Wenqing's work.</p>
<p>Or someone may suspect: Jin Renjie once authored a novel that was not recorded in the "Record of Ghosts." But this suspicion is also difficult to believe. "Record of Ghosts" records Zaju drama authors, and invariably attaches their other works, such as Qu Yanying's "One Hundred and Twenty Lines" and Yuan Ben of " Money Slave", Wang Bocheng's "Heavenly Facts Forgotten Palace Tune", Zhong Junxiang's "Loving Daughter Theory", Shen He's "Happy Enemies", "Eight Views of Xiaoxiang", Qian Lin's "Drunken Revelations", Wu Renqing's "Golden Thread New Sound", etc., and Lu Dianzhi's novel "Good Son Zhao Zheng Story", is also especially . If Jin Renjie had a novel, it seems unlikely that it would not be recorded. Also, if it is a novel, Zhong would not have put him in the list of dramas (whenever there are other writings, "Record of Ghosts" invariably attaches them to the mini biography.) Furthermore, if Jin Renjie had both a famous drama and a novel of the same name, it should also be noted in the mini biography to avoid confusion. In short, from the perspective of "Record of Ghosts," it can be very certain that Jin Renjie's "Crime Committed at the East Window" is a Zaju drama, and definitely not a novel. The reason for this is entirely Lang Ying's misremembering. Therefore, Qing Jiao Xun's "Drama Theory" Volume 5 said: "Kong Wenqing has the drama 'Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window,' and Jin Renjie also has it, 'but it is a pity that it is not transmitted.'" He is the most able to distinguish truth from falsehood, and is not misled by Lang Ying.</p>
<h3>Lightness</h3>
<p>— Kuang Ying</p>
<p>A white silk shirt swung a few times on the bamboo pole and fell to the ground, so comforting and peaceful. Like a white cloud without intention, guarding the opposite peaks, without a trace of waves. I don't want to pick it up, fearing that my hands will be stained with the breath of soil, and stain it with worldliness.</p>
<p>A child who picked up a tree branch and returned, singing a small tune without notes, glanced at the white silk shirt on the ground and walked past it.</p>
<p>What a light and leisurely scene this should be!</p>
<p>Yesterday I walked past the stream in the village in front. Several laundry women whispered on the smooth stones by the stream, the beat of the washing club close to the clothes, and after they coldly glanced at me , even the whispers fell silent. This return has actually chased back ten years of my past, reminding me of listening to the tide on my pillow as a child. I was the darling of the sea, but now, lingering in this mountain city with its narrow boundaries, I can't even find a familiar face.</p>
<p>Watching snowflakes scatter on the waters and mountains, I think of the catkins flying along the shore, which could not be more light; watching the hurried comings and goings of pedestrians outside the window, I think of the swallows flying across the sky, which could not be more light. But tonight, under the lamp, a traveler far from home will not have the leisure lightness of a white silk shirt falling on the ground, let alone the whispering feelings of laundry women by the stream. Instead, I am counting the stars in the corner of the room, one, two, those countless lost stories.</p>
<p>The sound of distant temple bells tells me that there are still of in the human world.</p>
<h3>Verses Written on the Road Between Florence and Pisa by Lord Byron</h3>
<p>— Zhen Qin's Tentative Translation</p>
<p>Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story;</p>
<p>The days of our youth are the days of our glory;</p>
<p>And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty</p>
<p>Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.</p>
<p>What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?</p>
<p>'Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled.</p>
<p>Then away with all such from the head that is hoary!</p>
<p>What care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?</p>
<p>Oh Fame!—if I e'er took delight in thy praises,</p>
<p>'Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,</p>
<p>Than to see in the eyes of the loved one discover,</p>
<p>That not without worth in those eyes was your lover.</p>
<p>There only I've sought thee, there only I've found thee;</p>
<p>Her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;</p>
<p>When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,</p>
<p>I knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.</p>
<p>[Note] This lyric poem was written by Byron in mid-November 1821 and first published in the author's "Letters and Diaries" in 1830. The myrtle and ivy mentioned in the first verse are symbols of youth and joy. In ancient Greek festivals, they were used to garlands, and ivy was also a plant dedicated to Bacchus, the god of wine. The victor's crown is made of laurel branches, so laurel represents honor. -- Translator</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun then explained in detail her journey of the past ten days or so, the terrifying experiences she had, and the dangerous environment she was currently in. What follows is a memoir…</p>
<p>Even before the launch of the "Eighth Secret" plan, the head of the Matsu Group, Doihara, greedy for merit and jealous of talent, contacted several executive committee members of the Black Dragon Society. After obtaining the outline of the "Conquer China" military plan, Tsurumi managed to discover the content. He had long wanted to send someone to infiltrate the Matsu Group and establish a secret radio station in Shanxi to monitor the Matsu Group's actions and disrupt them when possible. However, his own manpower was too thin and he was unable to allocate it, so he hesitated. This time, after returning to Tokyo, in order to explore the "Seven Secret Seals," he learned that the Matsu Group's power had gradually expanded from Pei Bei to Wanquan, then to Datong, and then to Taiyuan. If he did not take steps to curb them, when the war eventually extended to Shanxi, they could seize the entire territory of Shanxi without lifting a finger in a short period of time.</p>
<p>At the same time, Doihara was also a cunning old fox. The subordinates he employed were all members of the Matsu Group, and they organized their own separate telecommunications agencies and general staff headquarters. He did not use any specially trained telecommunications personnel from the mainland headquarters. Even if someone was very capable, it was impossible to infiltrate this organization. Therefore, apart from recruiting talent to establish a branch in Shanxi, there was no other way.</p>
<p>With Yaoqun's knowledge and training, could she not handle the responsibility of organizing this branch on her own? Unfortunately, this organization required Japanese people or those proficient in Japanese to be able to perform the job well. She did not speak a word of Japanese, and her only assistant for the time being, Little Tiger, also did not understand Japanese, so he naturally could not help her in leading this "spy" work.</p>
<p>However, the situation was urgent and could not be put aside just because there were no suitable people. After seeing W, and myself carefully researching it, the situation in Peiping took a sharp turn for the worse at this time. Therefore, we decided on a compromise: we entrusted all the affairs of our Changxindian headquarters to W's headquarters for collection and safekeeping; all of our team members were transferred to Shanxi; and W, using the name of the headquarters, appointed Yaoqun to go with us to expand the work and organize a combined counter-espionage network: the work of exploring the Matsu Group's information would be handled by me and "04"; and the action aspect would be directed by Yaoqun. If there were any emergency measures beyond my ability, they would be handled by Tsurumi. If Tsurumi could spare the time, he would of course be stationed in Shanxi permanently and work with us.</p>
<p>When Tsurumi initially cabled from the east, instructing us to transplant to Shanxi, Yaoqun had already received the news from me and was very happy. On the one hand, she also planned to go to the old stronghold in the Northeast to find some talent to work with us. Later, when she saw Tsurumi come to Peiping, because of the failure to explore the "Secrets," he seemed dispirited and did not mention the matter, she was naturally puzzled. When she could no longer restrain herself, she brought it up to Tsurumi in person. Although Tsurumi responded vaguely, he was not as direct and straightforward as W, who readily agreed and promised to provide everything needed. As a result, Yaoqun reasonably developed a small misunderstanding.</p>
<p>This small misunderstanding accumulated in Yaoqun's heart. When Pingzi arrived in Peiping, and showed herself during the conflict between Tsurumi and the puppet police garrison commander, and decided to whisk Tsurumi away to Shanghai within a few hours that night, the small misunderstanding evolved into a certain feeling, a mysterious and inexplicable misunderstanding that often occurs between men and women. Only then did she truly rise up and request W to be allowed to take on the responsibility alone and go to Shanxi to work.</p>
<p>Scientific Weekly</p>
<h3>Inaugural Declaration</h3>
<p>Now is the world of science, and we have entered the atomic age. The power of two atomic bombs hastened the end of the Second World War. This is the most significant demonstration of the effectiveness of science in history. Therefore, all new developments in politics, diplomacy, military affairs, economics, and transportation in the post-war world are directly or indirectly influenced by the power of science. For example, the secrecy of the atomic bomb has intimidated emerging ambitious nations, and the future world's security and human happiness are built upon the development of science.</p>
<p>The world is changing so drastically and science is progressing so rapidly. Individually, without adequate scientific knowledge and cultivation, it is difficult to keep up with this complex modernized life and one inevitably becomes a backward person, not even qualified to enjoy it. Nationally, without a solid scientific foundation and facilities, one cannot achieve independence and autonomy, let alone qualify to be among the powerful nations. Look at the post-war reconstruction efforts in various countries. Those with advanced science, such as the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and other countries, have a wealth of scientific talent and have quickly reorganized their countries in an orderly manner and rebuilt them!</p>
<p>Conversely, look at our country. Two years after victory, how much reconstruction work has been done? On the one hand, domestic unrest has hindered many construction projects. At the same time, it is also because our country's scientific foundation is too poor and we lack talent. Not to mention that construction work has not even begun, even the handover work has not been done well, resulting in discontinuity, low production, inflation, and an economy on the brink of collapse. It is painful to speak of! However, it is never too late to mend the fold. For the sake of building a foundation for the country and for the people to survive, we can only beg for the help of omnipotent science. Only science can save us, bringing us back from the dead, its effects are always reliable. The facts are so, there is no need to doubt. All ambitious youths and progressive citizens must enrich their scientific knowledge, intensify their scientific training, inspire scientific thinking, and become modernized citizens with scientific cultivation, to undertake the great task of national reconstruction and create a truly free, equal, prosperous, and strong democratic nation.</p>
<p>For the past seventy years, this newspaper has been dedicated to promoting cultural undertakings, and it has paid particular attention to the development of science. It has always been at the forefront of reporting on scientific matters, enlightening the people of the new nation, and has published several scientific columns. However, due to frequent personnel changes and a volatile world situation, it was published and then discontinued, which is regrettable! But the importance of science is growing with the times. Scientific undertakings, which had just begun to sprout, have shrunk again due to the disruption of the eight-year war of resistance, and need to be promoted even more. With this in mind, we are re-issuing "Scientific Weekly." It is edited by our own staff, with specially invited experts writing articles, and we welcome contributions from all parties. The aim is to instill scientific knowledge in the general public, to cultivate a habit of scientific study among the people, to raise the scientific level of the people through subtle influence, and to supplement the shortcomings of school education. It is intended for the general public, not for experts. The editorial content is standardized to suit the comprehension of the general reader, and the writing is preferably in-depth and easy to understand, rich in interest. It is best to use popular language to describe profound academic principles, introduce scientific ideas, explain scientific phenomena, and synthesize scientific reports. The articles should be brief, and any novel scientific theses, modern scientific trends of thought, as well as scientific news, book reviews, and other works, written in the vernacular, are welcome. We only discuss science and do not involve other matters. At the beginning of this publication, we are briefly stating our purpose, which should be considered a dedication. We hope that you will understand!</p>
<h3>The Concepts of Atoms and Molecules</h3>
<p>— Zeng Shiyu</p>
<p>The concept of the atom, as everyone knows today, originated in Greece. The reason why the ancient Greeks engaged in this root-seeking thought about the ultimate structure of matter was because the dialectician Zeno had argued that Achilles, the swift-footed warrior in mythology, could not overtake a tortoise. The sophism and conditions set by Zeno were that Achilles, when chasing the tortoise, must first reach the place where the tortoise initially started. When he reached this point, the tortoise would have moved forward a considerable distance during this time. By the time he crossed this distance and reached the tortoise's second starting point, the tortoise would have moved forward again. Therefore, following this recursion, he would never be able to overtake this slow-moving tortoise. Sophistry and casuistry were highly regarded by the Greeks. Those who refuted Zeno's seemingly true but false argument said that the actual distance could not be infinitely divided at will. This means that if it cannot be divided to an infinitely small extent, Zeno's conclusion would not hold. Applying this kind of thinking to actual matter, can matter be infinitely divided by physical methods? If there is a final limit to the division of matter, then this is the starting point of the concept of the atom.</p>
<p>Among the Greek philosophers, the earliest to advocate the atomic theory was Democritus. According to him, the universe contains empty space, and besides that, there are an infinite number of atoms that are extremely small in shape and cannot be further divided. The existence of objects is entirely due to the aggregation and dispersion of groups of atoms. Although this kind of speculation is very precise, it is not supported by actual verification. It was not until the development of modern science that the theory of atoms could become truly accurate.</p>
<p>Democritus lived around 400 years before the Christian era. By the beginning of the 19th century, when modern chemistry was emerging, the British scholar Dalton, in order to give a systematic explanation of the laws discovered by experiments in chemistry, established his atomic theory of the structure of matter. His theory was not only clearer than what the Greeks had imagined, but he further reasoned that since atoms are indivisible and extremely small units, the combination of each atom with another type of atom must take an integer and form a simple ratio to form different substances. This means that one atom of type A must combine with one, two, three, four, or other integers of atoms of type B. If the number of atomic proportions is different, then the properties of the substances formed will be different. This inference is the most important and extremely outstanding feature of Dalton's theory. If this inference can be proven by the results of experiments and no exceptions are found, then the structure of matter is indeed as Dalton imagined, and is in fact formed by the aggregation of extremely small units of atoms. Before Dalton announced his theory, he had already discovered his law of multiple proportions. This law states that when one element combines with another element to form multiple substances, if a certain amount of the former element is taken, the amount of the latter element contained in each compound must form a simple multiple of each other. The explanation of this law can be derived from the final inference in Dalton's theory. Dalton then took methane and ethylene as examples. In these two compounds, the weights of carbon in one and the other compound formed a ratio of one to two. Later, more and more in chemistry, it is increasingly long to prove the accuracy of Dalton's theory.</p>
<p>The atom is the smallest unit when matter is constructed, which seems to be conceivable. However, to what extent the atom is so small that we still cannot obtain a concrete concept based on Dalton's theory. A large number of atoms aggregate to form a molecule. If we can see the volume of the molecule, and also know how many atoms of different types are in one molecule, then the volume of the atom can also be inferred from this. However, the molecule is also a tiny object. To what extent each substance is tiny before it becomes a unit molecule, this cannot be measured by ordinary methods either. Therefore, we must have a clear definition of the molecule. From this definition, we can then infer the size of the molecule. Can Avogadro's law be used as the definition of a molecule? Avogadro's law says, "At the same temperature and pressure, the number of molecules of all gases in the same volume is equal." Therefore, we can make the following provision for the concept of molecules. Taking various gases of the same volume under the same pressure and temperature, we measure, count, measure, and calculate them. If we find that each has the same numerical value, then this is the numerical value of the molecules we are seeking. All gases, in certain conditions, take a certain volume, and there must be a certain number of molecules in it. If we can find this numerical value, and also know the number of atoms in one molecule, then the atom can also become an individual that can be measured and counted. The progress of modern chemistry and the ability to refine the research on atomic structure are all due to the fact that we not only know that the atom really has its body, but also allow our measurement and counting to stop.</p>
<p>Scholars have concluded that atoms exist because they have investigated whether matter can be infinitely divided. Applying this idea to the study of electrical phenomena, it was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century that electric current, which has a beginning and an end and does not accumulate, is composed of electrons, which are even smaller than atoms, following each other closely. Applying this kind of thinking to the study of radiant energy, we further learned that energy also has its indivisible unit - the quantum. However, before the formal establishment of the atomic theory, Europeans in the West felt that there was no limit to the arbitrary division of time in physics and length in mathematics, which eventually led to the invention of differential calculus, which is also the most successful creation of human thought. However, all these achievements stem from our desire to study whether all phenomena in the universe can be arbitrarily and infinitely divided. There is a book in our country that says, "Take half of a one-inch pole every day, and it will never end for generations." This is similar to the problem posed by the Greek philosopher Zeno, but our country did not produce a profound fundamental concept of science because of it, nor did it have the formation of a precise atomic theory, which is something we can regard as regrettable.</p>
<h3>"Moonlight City"</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>Everyone believes that Austin, Texas, USA, is the only city in the world illuminated by artificial moonlight. Just like other cities use ordinary street lamps, for many years, soft blue light from mercury lamps on top of twenty-nine iron towers has illuminated the entire city. These iron towers, fourteen stories high, illuminate eight square miles of the city.</p>
<h3>On Mica</h3>
<p>— Tianmeng</p>
<p>And Its Artificial Manufacturing Method</p>
<p>Mica has some value in the electrical industry, because it has certain properties that other substances cannot match. For example, muscovite mica can be easily split into extremely thin sheets, and these sheets have unexpectedly high electrical resistance to passing electricity. Mica is quite tough and elastic. A good piece of mica sheet can be rolled into seven cylinders with a diameter of one-eighth of an inch without breaking. If you heat this cylinder to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it can still act as a good insulator under a high voltage of 12,000 volts.</p>
<p>Because mica is not affected by heat and electricity, mica sheets are often used to wrap the heating wires of electric ovens. However, the most important use of mica is in generators, motors, and radio tubes, because mica can be used to isolate the heating parts through which the current passes, so as to eliminate adverse effects such as short circuits and power loss.</p>
<p>In the spark plugs on airplanes, mica has also replaced qualifications, because the temperature and pressure generated by airplane engines are higher and greater than those of automobile engines, and the temperature changes are also more drastic.</p>
<p>The automobile industry is also one of the big consumers of mica. Before the war, 250 million pieces were used each year just for rectifiers that start engines and generators.</p>
<p>Other uses include the splendor used for decorating wallpaper and other decorations, as well as mica powder used in rubber manufacturing to prevent excessive adhesion.</p>
<p>Mica has only been used in Europe for three hundred years. India used it earlier. Today, the electrical industry is booming and the demand is greater, so artificial manufacturing methods have to be used to make up for the lack of natural mica.</p>
<p>Among the artificial mica manufacturing methods, the one invented by the Germans two months before their surrender was the most successful. The method is to first put sand, cryolite, and other raw materials in a stone crucible and heat them to melt them, and then a mixture is obtained. When this mixture is cooled from 1270 degrees Celsius to 1230 degrees Celsius, it is split into sheets like natural mica after being treated with a magnetic field. Unfortunately, after the Germans surrendered, they were unable to continue to complete the production for the market, so it has not been paid attention to.</p>
<h3>Total Mobilization of Soviet Geographers During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Yan Deyi</p>
<p>The total mobilization of Soviet geographers during World War II, after the victory, the director of the Geographical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Grigoriev (A. A. Grigoricv), has reported. The wartime work began in June 1941, with the joint cooperation of geographical researchers of the institute and members of the Soviet Geographical Society, conducting field surveys, research, and writing, with great achievements and great merit.</p>
<p>The wartime work of Soviet geographers had two major missions that were most urgent. One was geographical readings for front-line combat troops. The battle lines were long, the war zones were vast, and the natural and human landscapes were intricate and complex. Soldiers were unfamiliar with the local environment everywhere. Only with on-the-spot investigation of geographical information could they have a basis for advancing and retreating and adapt to life. The second was reference materials for rear defense construction. The destruction of artillery fire, the reconstruction of factories, and the strategic reorganization and deployment must be based on the distribution of national resources and transportation to ensure that supply and demand are met and work is stable. The Soviet Union's great war against Germany was initially frustrated and then victorious. The front-line battlefield extended to Central Europe and Southeastern Europe, and rear construction developed the hinterland of the Eurasian continent. Secret reconnaissance and adventurous exploration, the Soviet geographers' important tasks in the front and rear were extremely arduous.</p>
<p>Serving the front-line combat troops with geographical information, the area of Soviet combat operations was greater than that of any other country. The battlefields were all over the country and abroad. The mountains, rivers, terrain, customs, and human feelings of the local area were relied on geographical readings from various places to be available at any time. Therefore, the Geographical Institute was responsible for compiling and supplying them. In the first two years, the gazetteers of Romania, Hungary, eastern Germany (natural environment), southern Germany (economy), Norway, Finland (natural environment), Turkey, Afghanistan (economy), and Xinjiang were completed one after another, all of which were based on information from the on-the-spot investigations of geographers. The comparison of land and water transportation routes and the weather changes at airfields were detailed, meticulous, accurate, and novel. The General Staff and the Military Command were able to adapt to the time and place and seize the opportunity to win. The various offensives on the Soviet battlefield were characterized by seasonality. In terms of tactics, the Soviet troops were good at using small terrain and changes in ground scenery. Soviet geographers' research on the scenery of various places was even more closely cooperated with botanists and soil scientists everywhere, so that complete reports could be made.</p>
<p>The greatest failure of the Soviet Union in the initial war against Germany was the destruction of the occupied areas and the forced evacuation of factories. The relocation of ordnance factories and the reconstruction of national defense industries were the responsibility of engineers and business managers, but the new site for the evacuation and establishment of the factories had to be a location with abundant raw materials and convenient transportation as the basic conditions. The Soviet Geographical Institute first designated the Kazakh Republic as its designated area. Kazakhstan was originally a vast grassland in the heart of the Eurasian continent, with an area of millions of square miles and rich resources. It was far away from any line of defense and was never threatened by enemy troops. It was the safest area for Soviet national defense. In 1942, when the Soviet Geographical Institute was working in Kazakhstan, it coordinated with the work of the Mara Mountain Resource Mobilization Committee in all aspects, and further studied the value of the entire Western Siberia, all of which were devoted to and led by the president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Komarov (VL. Komarov).</p>
<p>The economic mobilization of Kazakhstan was indeed a great and arduous task. The area was a large landlocked hinterland in Central Asia, closed and remote. The natural and human geography was vague. The work of the Soviet Geographical Institute started with mapping as its goal. The construction of the inland national defense relied on the increase in food and raw materials. The analysis of the possibility of agricultural development in the hinterland of Central Asia urgently required accurate estimates and predictions of changes. The northern and central parts of Kazakhstan are well-known arid areas, with only sufficient rainfall for three to five weeks each spring. The system for how to use underground spring water and how to design and construct water conservancy projects must first carefully observe the distribution system of surface runoff. The mapping of the entire topographic map was the basic work for repairing water conservancy and developing agriculture. The study of other geographical conditions was not neglected either. The fact that there are now cotton, rubber grass, and food crops in the barren hinterland of Central Asia is not accidental. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Electric Eels and Radar</h3>
<p>— Xi Yi</p>
<p>Among fish, many have bodies that carry electricity, such as electric catfish, electric rays, electric eels, etc., which are all very famous examples, but the one with the strongest power generation is the electric eel.</p>
<p>The scientific name of the electric eel is Electropliorus Electricus. It can weigh up to 30 pounds, with an average length of five feet, and the tail is particularly long, about four feet, which is the part with the strongest electricity. Its strength can electrocute people and animals, reaching a distance of thirty feet. Sixty percent of the tail is electric tissue. The tip of the tail is the cathode, and the tip of the head is the anode. Connecting the two poles can form a complete circuit, generating strong vibrations to repel enemies, protect oneself, and obtain food for survival. People who catch eels often do not understand this principle. If they grab this serpentine electric eel and use too much force, they often unintentionally encounter the electric eel's tail strike, and experience a kind of inexplicable feeling.</p>
<p>When swimming, electric eels can emit a kind of large, fast pulse. Like radar, it is used to probe the surrounding situation. Its method is to emit a strong 50-volt electric pulse from the electric cells at the rear end of the tail 50 times per second to probe whether there is food or enemies in the water. If the pulse reaches a small fish and there is a reaction, even if it is more than 100 feet away, the pores of the electric eel's body can receive this reaction feeling, because its head can be used as an antenna. After using radar to detect the location of the small fish, the electric eel immediately emits a strong 550-volt electricity from its abdomen, shooting directly at the target to stun or kill the small fish, and then catch it for food.</p>
<p>According to the research of Dr. David Nachmansohn of Columbia University, the radar pulses emitted by this electric eel are too fast to be sensed by the human nervous system, but the chemical reactions obtained from this prove that they are related to nerve activity and can establish the electrical relationship of human nerve impulses. It is said that this discovery will have special effects in treating chemical nerve diseases.</p>
<p>The reproductive method of electric eels is still a mystery. During the dry season, electric eels mostly swim in the upper reaches of the Amazon River, threatening the livestock and other wild animals in the river. However, when the rainy season comes and the river water rises, their whereabouts are unknown. Some scientists believe that they have retreated into the ocean, but their electrical equipment cannot be used in salt water, so this statement is obviously not credible, so it is said to be a mystery. Currently, the place in the United States that raises the most electric eels is the Bronx Zoo, which has 20 large wooden tanks placed in the basement. Each tank has many active and healthy electric eels for experimentation. According to Dr. Guo Zi of the New York Aquarium, when each electric eel is placed in a specially designed tank and made to emit electricity, it can cause 200 electric rainbow lamps to emit excessive light. There are several indicator lights in the Bronx Zoo that are powered by electric eels, which is truly a living generator. The world is so big, there are all kinds of wonders, and electric eels can be considered a miracle!</p>
