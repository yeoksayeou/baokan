<h3>美衆院外委會報告力主緊急援助歐亞　公布蘇聯現有武裝人數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，美衆院外交委員會今日向衆院提出一報告，力促對歐洲與中國作五億九千萬美元之緊急援助，迅即採取行動，以防止共產主義之蔓延，並稱：目下蘇聯有武裝人員四百〇五萬我，此項估計係根據陸軍部之調查。該報告謂，蘇聯顯有一清楚與確定之政策，企圖阻止美國對歐亞之援助，並僅量使之不生效力。並稱：吾人於協助他國時，必須同時使我國本身強盛，俾與愛好自由各國聯合一致，以防任何意外。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，美衆院外交委員會發表報告稱：蘇聯企圖打銷美國對歐，亞之援助，並盡力使之代價昂貴。俾使美國在經濟上蒙受損失。該委會並將陸軍部之數字公布，說明蘇聯及其附庸國現有武裝人員五百二十一萬三千人，而歐洲愛好自由各國所能立即召集者，僅三百四十一萬六千人，其比例約為五比三。該報告中力促迅速通過對外五億九千萬美元之緊急援助，包括對中國之六千萬美元之臨時援助在內，並義為援歐工作頗有成功希望，歐洲人之逐漸背棄共產主義，日益明顯，法·義兩國共產黨之排斥於內閣之外，即可證明此點。衆院決定於星期四討論對外緊急援助案。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，美衆院外交委員會主席伊頓，今日向衆院規程委員會宣讀報告，力促加速通過對外緊急援助案，後者即將於星期四在衆院提出討論。伊氏稱：蘇聯能在廿四小時內佔領全部歐洲，目前則尙不欲眞正之戰爭立即發生。蘇聯一日假法。義共黨之手而佔領法。義二國、則即可佔領希，土二國。</p>
<h3>王外長報告外交　美朝野視綫現集中歐洲　援華及對日和約問題頗受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外長王世杰三日在某集會報告外交稱：歐洲局勢漸緊，各國工潮澎湃，義共黨亦將有所舉動，美朝野視綫集中歐洲，故援華及對日和約問題頗受影響，外部迄未接獲美。英關於對日和約之覆文，蘇聯覆文我正硏究中。關於退羅問題，王氏稱：該國政變後，我方保迄持觀察態度，並候詳細確實之報吿，承認其新政府否？未定，美·英各國亦然，至該國駐華大使杜勒拉近被　政府免職，惟我在未承認其新政府前，尙不否認杜之合法地位。</p>
<h3>外交部實行內外互調制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外次葉公超三日在記者招待會席上稱，外部對內外互調辦法，正逐漸實行。渠以今日同時出席之情報司代理職責長時　　為例，謂時代司長原任南非總領事，此次調回部內任情報司代理司長，原任司長張沅長順病　美，一時不克返國。葉氏公析外部實行內外互調制之阻礙，謂現有三大困難使內外互調制不克全部實現：　我國缺乏交通工具，調任人員旅程困難，　外部經費有限，不願過事消耗外匯，　人才困難。渠並解釋最後一點稱：外部對人才之吸收，仍時予注意。</p>
<h3>我駐奧地利公使內定沈士華充任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕我駐奧地利公使已內定由我派駐該國之外交代表沈士華充任，沈已自瑞京前往維也納，國府任命即發表。</p>
<h3>我派憲兵赴日盟總早已同意　派遣佔領軍暫難實現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據駐日代表團上海辦事處負責人表示：「我國派遣憲兵赴日，盟軍總部在原則上早已同意，惟人數尙在洽商中。商團長之意，認爲人數不宜過少，應爲完整之一隊。該批憲兵赴日後之給養及居住問題，一槪由我國自理。」記者詢以憲兵派遣之後，是否可能有佔領軍之派　，渠答謂：「此事在目前不能實現，因第一爲外匯上之困難，一師人在國外之消耗，相當可觀，其次，日本目前住屋大成問題，美軍在日本者，現正大興土木；我國如派一師人前往，則營房倉庫在在皆成問題，故派佔領軍赴日之事，短期內尙不能成爲事實·　」</p>
<h3>日賠償機械設備麥師續批準一批</h3>
<p>提前配予中英等四國</p>
<p>〔中央社東京三日電據今晨官方宣布：麥帥頃於已指定分配之先遣賠償機械設備一萬九千件外，復批准再以其他賠償機械及設備，提前分配予中·英·菲·荷四國。四要求賠償國所經分配獲得之新賠償設備，大部仍與自兵工廠撥出之賠償設備相同，其中包括一切可以遷移之機械，惟經特別指定適應佔領需要之軍事設備，及依據遠軍委會政策准許日本保留之若干其他設備除外。官方之聲明，未說明新分配賠償物資之數額，惟指稱將不超過日本九十所陸海軍兵工廠設備之百分之卅，</p>
<h3>中港協定尙須修正　葉公超答記者問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外部次長葉公超，三日下午在記者招待會席上，就中港訂定協定及旅大問葉氏守口如瓶，尤以旅大問題為然。記者問：中港協定已於何日簽訂，可否公佈，其內容如何？葉稱：中港間有兩項協定，一爲續談商；關務協定我曾提出方案</p>
<p>粵海關十一個月以來緝獲私貨　千億宋子文強調增入口配額</p>
<p>〔本報廣州三日電〕據海關負責人變：自本年元月至十一月份止，緝獲私貨共值千億元以上，數目之鉅，全年稅收亦在其後，走私之盛殊足驚人。宋子文度席在省參會中報告，謂中央雖已與香港訂立緝私協定，並　海關與海運加強查緝，惟本省所需原料，如無法獲全理數量之進口，則禁絕走私料感困難，若本省要求之百分之十八之入口配額，如獲中央批准，則必可立即防止走私。</p>
<p>〔又電〕粵海關為協助政府管制米糧出口禁令，特別強查緝，二日曾在各輪船緝獲私運出口白米　擔，全部予以充公。，港方迄未提出對案，故均未能簽訂·關於旅大問題，記者詢以除上月我致蘇聯照會外，尚有其他接觸否？葉答：我方照會純爲聲明我方立塲，此外並無其他接觸，除此以外，葉氏對記者之有關旅大問題之詢問，均不作答。</p>
<h3>華北剿匪總部限一週內成立　傳作義將辭察省主席</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕關係當局談：國防部昨有命令，限華北剿匪總司令部一週內成立，短期內在平辦公，俟　合之保定綏署結束竣事，仍移豐台。總司令下設二個或三個副司令，分駐　察綏各重鎭，人選將不出陳繼承，上官雲相，宋肯堂，鄧　珊四氏。傳氏將辭却察省生席職，專事軍事指揮，熱察二省新主席可能同時發表，最高當局已請傳氏銓衡適當人選。國府雖明令此總部轄區爲晋，冀，熱，察，綏，實際上，晋省將僅及雁北，太原綏署仍照舊存在，外傳另設冀熱遼邊區司令部說不確，且總部成立後，轄區內之綏靖區（如熱西）名稱同時取消，而將於總部下編三四個兵團，節制各軍，總都編制雖尙未到，大體將與綏署相同，原則上，北平行轅仍處監督地位，孫連仲此後即僅負冀省行政實任。記者會詢及總部成立後，華北局面之開展及兵力問題，此有資格人士稱：開展將在明年初，現有兵力即足用，蓋過去之有失敗，即因各區域間未能機動運用兵力。記者詢以將來如察綏兵力調用他處，晋西北以及晋北共匪是否將形成共匪進擾之另一目標。氏稱：可無慮，傳氏已在察綏編練有力之後備軍，中央並已　予優良配被，關於未來之軍政配合問題，氏稱，傳氏憶著手擬定具體方案，以糾正過駢之脫節現象。</p>
<p>〔又電〕新任雁北剿匪司令于鎭河，今晨乘車赴大同就任。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕傳作義今續與各方接洽，其總部籌備處明開始在國際聯歡社辦公。</p>
<p>〔又電〕軍息：據報，共匪對華北新設剿匪統一機構，正集議對策，過來除彭德懷賀龍在　西北召集高級幹部會議個，聶榮臻在石家莊亦召集幹部會議。</p>

<p>〔本報南京三日電〕蔣主席三日下午四時召見財長俞鴻　，財次徐板塊園，對當前財政經濟措施，　以　詢，尤對華南走私等情況，詢問甚祥。蔣主席對當前財政金融概况極爲關心，曾對俞徐兩氏頻加詢問。</p>
<p>〔又電〕「金融管理局之成立，僅係政府對當前經濟管制揹施之初涉。」此爲全經會某負責人對記者之談話，渠並稱：其全部計劃尙待四局成立後，各就所　地區範圍內之經濟金融情形，擬就針對現實之辦法，並行之有效後，始能擴展其更具體之計劃。</p>

<p>〔本報北平三日電〕平行　參謀長徐啓明今日稱：連日平靜之元氏城，昨晚共匪復集中砲火猛攻城垣，守軍應擊，下午五時該地電訊中斷。</p>
<h3>蘇北共匪老巢　合德鎭克復</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州三日電〕位於蘇北鹽城東北射陽河以南，被共匪盤踞十二年，號稱共匪蘇北海濱老巢之合德鎭，現爲淮海綏靖區部隊攻克，共匪設於該處之農業軋油廠，連同　　之圖書十　萬冊，悉為國軍　獲，並從俘虜口供中獲悉，該處實為共匪現階段在蘇北之政治經濟重心及補給基地。殘存蘇北之共匪十一十二兩縱隊，受此嚴重打擊，今後當益感窮困。淮海綏靖區部隊，於上月中句自漢水以東之六塘河南岸始向東進剿，經過鹽城舊黃河，曾擊破共匪十一十二兩縱隊之堅強抵抗，迄上月底始進抵射陽河南岸，而將合德鎭一帶攻克。</p>

<h3>鄧文儀報告一週戰局　匪會處被動地位正走上潰敗的道路</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國防部新聞局長鄧文儀，三日下午在記者招待會席上，報告十一月二十六日至十二月二日一週戰局稱：</p>
<p>華北方面</p>
<p>這一週，華北方面的戰局，大體上比較平靖，由於傳作義將軍的出任華北剿匪總司令，張垣保定兩綏署的編倂，統一了華北前綫作戰的指揮，增强了華北剿匪的陣容，今後該方的戰局，必有新的發展，在平漢北段，除了匪軍自本月二十七日後繼續不斷的晝夜猛撲元氏，曾數度迫近城垣，經我守軍喋血反擊，幷在空軍協助輪番轟炸掃射下，使匪軍遭受了重大的傷亡外，只有保定外　縱時發現匪軍，在距城十餘華里至四五十華里的地區竄擾遊擊，雙方尙無較大接觸。</p>
<p>東北方面</p>
<p>東北方面，匪軍自六次攻勢失敗後，其人力和物力，各方面損失非常重大，單就傷兵方面估計，在十一月二十四二十五日集結於吉林以南　樹林子待運送的傷病兵，就有四萬多人，最近海城大石橋克復，潘陽營口間鐵路再歸國軍掌握，加以天氣寒冷，匪軍冬季作戰裝備缺乏，故中長路兩側的匪軍紛紛退向遼源雙山和西安西豐的山地裹去，一而在搜刮衣食，一面在强徵民兵整理補充；但是十一月中旬，吉北匪軍第十縱隊二十九師，在九台以北地區全部　變，紛紛逃散，這就是東北匪軍士氣低落，軍心動搖最明顯的例證。</p>
<p>陝北方面</p>
<p>陝北方面，國軍在楡林保衛戰的勝利，一方面又設明馬鴻逵將軍所部西北騎兵的忠勇善戰，在這次戰役中，共匪連受打擊，初碰　於楡林，再受挫於沙河，損失在二萬人以上，造成國軍在西北的輝　勝利，安定了整個西北的戰局，殘匪轉移兵力，襲擊三邊，因安邊僅守軍一連，故被攻陷，馬部援軍即可到達，不難收復。</p>
<p>陜邊境</p>
<p>豫陝邊境的孔從周匪，週來流竄於商南，漢川關，　西，鎭安各地，起初被我地方團隊到處截擊，疲於奔命，復又遭國軍的致命打擊，已被截成兩段，除一部回向伏牛山東北的　氏方面逃竄外，一部還在　西，鎭安，西鄉間送命，國軍正分頭搜剿中。豫西方面的陳　第四縱隊，在內鄉，鎭平被我民團打得損失過半，只好逃入內鄉北方的山地太山廟，車村一帶，其第九縱隊則在方城，唐河間地區，另一部第九縱隊的廿六旅，被國軍和民團隔斷，還在嵩縣和齒　鎭問地區徘徊，還有一部則踞　氏附近，爲第廿二旅，第卅一旅；孔匪從周回竄的殘匪，於國軍佔　氏後，又向東敗逃，現在豫境各地雨雪霏　，天寒地凍，匪軍缺衣缺食，除盡量搶　　掠外，尙無新行動。</p>
<p>大別山區</p>
<p>大別山南麓劉伯承匪部的一·二·三·六·各縱隊，上週在宿松，廣濟，黃梅，浠水，麻城一帶流竄，企圖藉鄂東湖沼池地帶的掩護，一方面想避實就虛，保存力量，一方面還想作準備偷渡大江的計劃，因遭我大軍優勢的壓迫，在江邊不能立足，又紛紛北逃，國軍干進佔太湖，英山，羅田後，匪大部敗經扶東北和光山，羅山以南地區集結，與陳毅北部呼應，大有準備在大別山區與國軍決一死戰的可能。</p>
<p>魯西皖北</p>
<p>此外，由太和，　陽南竄的陳毅匪軍一·三·四·六·各縱隊，目前大部已渡沙河，集結於沈邱東南地區，似有企圖向新蔡，漢川方面策應劉伯承，圖保全大別山麓，挽救立煌，太湖被國軍佔領後的危局，必要時更可爲劉匪北竄的接應，但自十一月廿六日金鄉解圍，匪軍第十，第十一，第八各縱隊退到單縣以西曹縣，城武後，以最近在平漢鐵路以東黃河以南的匪軍整個態勢來看，匪軍已完全處於被動的地位，嚴冬降臨，又失　穴，民團襲擊，補給困難，天時，地利，人和三種條件都漸喪失，正一天一天走上潰敗的道路。</p>
<h3>魯西豫南國軍續進展　單縣光山全克　膠東放棄龍口說絕不確</h3>

<h3>房屋租賃條例的實施</h3>
<p>自抗戰勝利以還，房屋租賃糾紛始終未　，立法院為合理解決房荒，破除現行房屋租賃辦法之積弊，進而保障房屋業主之旣得產權，經一再愼重硏討，並徵求各地民意機關及專家意見後，通過「房屋租賃條例」，業由國府於一日明令公佈施行。當立法院愼重審議該條例時，各地輿論有請求早頒合理租賃辦法的呼聲，中華法學會第四屆全會，更建議政府迅即制定租賃條例，俾利關於房屋糾紛的處理。立法院　採眾意，於是有房屋租賃條例的通過。我們細讀條例内容、深覺立法精神，不偏不倚，旣不拘泥事實，亦不事重理論，察其立法原意似在保護承租人（房客），扶助業主（大房東）取締轉租（二房東），使三者之應得利益，咸能兼顧。此其立法精神，公平合理，我們認為應略加闡述：</p>
<p>第一，該條例制定目的，似在調劑房屋供需。凡「可供居住之房屋，現非自用，且非出租者，政府得限期一個月內命其出租。自用之房屋，超過實際需要，依土地法第九十六條之規定，得限期命將超過需要之房屋出租」。其第二條主旨為限制房屋據為私有；所有房屋應為公眾而服務，以調劑供需，解決房荒。　所謂「實際需要」甚難有明確之標準，容易發生滋擾。立浅以保護人民利益為前提，似應由各省市政府於訂立補充辦法時，予以合理的補救。</p>
<p>第二，為確定租金担保金制度。租金為業主合法之收益，凡「房屋出租，除租金外，得收担保金。担保金最高額不得超過二個月租金之總額」。又第三條規定租金以「按月給付」為原則，而租金之「最高額得由該管政府經民意機關之同意，按當地經濟狀况予以限制」。並規定「出租人（業主）於租金担保金外，不得收取小費，或其他任何名義之費用」如有違反，依法處以罰鍰。是其主旨在確定租金之數額與繳付，担保金之比率與數額；並確定房屋租賃關係，除租金担保金為業主合法權益外，不得作額外之勒索或非份要求。這對於出租人和承租人，同　有保護意義。</p>
<p>第三，為限制房屋轉租。房屋轉租是一種惡劣制度，所謂「二房東」便產生於轉租；轉租所取費用，即所謂「頂費」，同為不合理不合法之積弊。本條例對轉租援限制主義，規定「承租人不得以房屋全部轉租他人，其以房屋之一部轉租者，如契約有反對之訂定時，應先經出租人書面同意，或將轉租契約送交出租人簽註。轉租租金，按房屋轉租部份與原租金比例計算，不得超過原租金一倍。原有担保金者，其担保金計算亦同，並应以租金担保金超出原額部份之半數給付出租人。轉租　屋，不得收取頂費，小費或其他任何名義之費用」。此其主旨至少含有三個要義：　房屋不得以全部轉租，如承租人與出租人原有契約許可，祗能轉租部份，但出租人有同意權，這是為了杜絕房屋的自由出頂；　轉租租金及担保金，有一定限制，出租人並得享受轉租的收益，這是為了破除轉租的中間剝削；　廢止頂費小費或其他變象勒索。所以說，本條例是嚴厲取締出頂，保護業主財產權的一種特别法。</p>
<p>第四，為保護承租人居住的安定。承租人依法向出租人租屋，乃承租人的居住權利，非依法律不得干涉。因此本條為保護承租人的權益；避免出租人的敲詐勒索，規定出租人非有左列情形之一時，不得終止契約關係：　承租人以房屋供違反法令之使用；　承租人積欠租金除以擔保金抵償，尙積欠　二個月以上；　故意或過失毁壞房屋，而不為修復或相當之補償；　未經出租人同意將房屋轉租他人；　出租人於契約期滿，提出確切證明收回自用；　約定租賃期限巳屆滿；　承粗人　閉房屋不為使用達六個月；　房屋必須改建。不過，「房屋經改建而仍出租者，原承租人有優先承租權」。此外，「收回自用之房屋；如過三個月空閒不用，或於一年内改租他人者，原承租人有精求繼續承租權，並得請求損害賠償」。如果出租人「於租賃關係存續中，無故迫令承租人遷出，承租人得請司法機關予以有效才保護」。此等規定的主旨在保護承租人的居住權益，立法周詳，顧到人情，同時限制出租人對承租人使用高壓，或不依法變更租賃關係等情事的發生。</p>
<p>除此以外，本條例尙有兩大特點：一為實施本條例之區域，規定機關「對於所屬人員供備宿舍者，不收租金。未供宿舍者，應給予相當金額之補助」。這對於公共公務機關服務人員，寓有特別優惠之意。其次，為謀都市社會福利，本條例又規定獎勵人民建築住宅。</p>
<p>「房屋租賃條例宅」，因之，是二宗進步的社會的立法。這進步性社會性的發揮，端賴法令的推行有效。首先地方政府要執行有力，不徇權勢，不循私情，纔能風行草　；其次就要各階層的人民守法，服從法律的一切規定。如果人民不守法，縱官府法院執法惟嚴，法律的進步性與社會性，也會消失。因此我們認為合理解決房荒，平衡租賃關係，政府就應該好好將這一條例付諸實行，庶幾目前的不良風氣，得以挽回，罰為英公主婚禮後，滿怖花朶之御軍載公主及其新婚夫婿，自白金漢宮出發，赴滑鐵盧車站，轉乘火車往溫却斯特渡密　。　（中央社）</p>

<h3>美英法力主對德和會　我應列為召集國　蘇代表仍緊決表示反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕今日之外投會議中，西方國家及蘇聯因中　參加朱來德國和會之問題而發生分裂。馬歇爾聲言，在波茨坦會議中即議定處理德國問　之外長會議，應包括五强連中國在內，渠深昐能遵守波茨坦會議之規定。莫洛托夫則反對馬歇爾之解釋，力言中國祇能爲日本和會之召集國，蓋中國並未簽字於德國之降書，而波茨坦協定所述者祇為簽字於降書之外長會議會員國。英法兩國外長均表示贊成中國為對德和會之召集國，結果此點仍未能成立協議。中國問題之談及係發生於西方國家與蘇聯就下列兩問題發生爭執之際，　較小盟國中，何者應參加起草對德和約之委員會；　何國應參加情報及諮詢會議。四强雖承認在對德宣戰之諸國中，宣戰有先後，受戰爭之損失亦輕輕重，其與和約之關係自不盡同，然何國應被列爲何款，則仍不能協議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕四外長今日舉行第七次會議，英美力主較小盟國有參加起草對德和約四主要委員會之權。馬歇爾並以加拿大爲例。外長會議今有四點尙待決定：　德國和會主要委會之組織，　中國應否參加會議；　小組委會由何國組成；　和會情報委會。莫洛托夫原建議和會之四主要委會，僅由四强參加，後經法外長皮杜爾之代表繆維爾建議，由四强邀請較小盟國代表參加。莫洛托夫遂放棄其原議，接受法國之議。惟英國則認此四主要委員會應由四强會同前此所列舉之十九國包括巴基斯坦在內組成，而美國則主張由四强會同適當數目之他國組成之。結果英美之一方與蘇法之一方，意見不能接近，卒無協議成立。外長會議乃討論中國問題，不獲結果，乃又討論情報委員會之組織，英法主張由五强會同十九盟國及其他若干不特定之國組成，蘇聯堅持僅能由五强及其他十九國組成，並同意英法建議之得由其他交戰國提供意見，但不能參加。馬歇爾則主張凡麗聯合國會員而曾對德宣戰者，均有參加情報會議之權。</p>
<h3>四强外長開始處理　奧地利和約問題　代表會議提出審報告</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕四外長會議今日對於起草德國和約事宜，辦論將屆結束，但各重要問題仍無進展。今後將處理奧地利和約問題。一部份美代表認爲目前會議僅足證明兩點，即蘇聯與西方各國暫時不能覓得關於德國前途之折衷基礎，且莫洛托夫決意利用該會作爲其對德人民發表政治演說之塲所。莫氏在此方面無疑非常成功。</p>

<p>嘈嚷巾戴愛蓮之九歲幼女葉萌擠入車廂，向康巴爾罕獻花，並附蘇致該團短函一件，代表本市歌舞界致歡迎之忱，康隨以康乃馨一朵簪於葉萌髮際，並相互攬頸微笑，兩情如接。嗣該團於軍樂聲中破　出站，赴華山路靑年館休息，抵達後，重由胡蝶補行獻花儀式，康含笑接受，雙員晤首一堂，熟烈握手問好，爲狀至爲歡洽。</p>

<p>陸京士末稱：硏究委員會之任務，爲硏究辦法提供政府作決定時之參放。此次徵詢各方意見後，研究委員會將開會硏討。在未開會或雖已決定辦法而未呈經吳市長核准以前，未便公佈。但陸氏向總工會，工業協會，市商會出席代表保證，負責在極短時期內擬具辦法，提供政府儘速決定。座談會至六時餘始散。</p>

<h3>在浙贛邊境線上</h3>
<p>〔本報上　二日快訊〕由金華搭火車前行。抵金華江大橋，該橋毁於敵人砲火，現在又建造起來了。但因鋼　內遝不易，所以改爲由國內工程師所創造的木拱架來完成。該橋長二八二九五四公尺。問同行浙　路局長侯家源氏，此橋能保持幾年？據吿：至少能保持五年，如時常檢査，換去將朽木條，則可保持至相當永久。再向前行，到靈山港，這裏是龍游境界，露山港也有大橋，爲利用外國人發明的木桁粱建造。此種木桁樑係用鋼圈貫串其間，異常堅實。見靈山港上，有竹筏數排，舟子涉水，拖動竹筏，渡過淺灘，問他們從何處來？他們說，昨天入城出售「黃紙」。原來此問產紙，爲燒化鬼神的，用行銷蘇北一帶。</p>
<p>浙贛路史一波三折</p>
<p>在車中，侯家源氏爲我們談浙贛路史：「民十六年浙省府勘察桐　，建的，關谿鐵道綫路，但每英里需十五萬元，後有款卅萬元，毅然想實行修路，以未蒙中央核准造鐵路，於是改爲蕭山常山公路，而浙省仍以自己之財力改建蕭常輕便鐵道，因標準鋼軌價昂，輕便鐵軌則價較隨便，是時德國正推展國外貿易，故將輕便鐵軌賒與浙省，於是建成標準軌距和輕便鐵道。又因衢常工程難做，改改做至江山，遂名杭江鐵路。即現在浙贛路浙境之路基。惟其時蕭諸間正在做公路中改做鐵路，故　道甚多，迄今仍然如此。後浙省發行建設公債，又將杭州電廠賣掉，再把鐵路造到蘭谿。民廿年中英庚款借錢賣鋼軌，廿一年以建設公債來借錢完成至王山段，適廿二年閩變，中央賴此鐵路得以迅速　平事變，因以重視此一鐵路，激起鐵道部在發行之建設公債內，撥一部份興修，江西也發行建設公債。又張公權介紹由中國銀行擔保向德借鋼軌，玉南段得以重軌完成，而改名爲浙贛鐵路。經十八個月之工作，於廿五年一月得通車南昌，廿六年八月復通車至萍鄉，又株州至萍鄉一段交浙贛路管理。</p>
<p>明年秋天全綫通車</p>
<p>此鹿旣成，適逢抗戰軍興，軍運頻繁，本預備杭州至王山段更換重軌，迨抗戰展開，首先拆去杭諸段，再拆去諸金段，再拆南萍段，最後又拆株萍段。日敵爲運江西糧食，又由杭復軌至金華，將勝利前又拆戰至諸暨，旋即勝利，剩杭諸段未拆。勝利前三戰區曾要求上饒至衢州通軍，勝利時得以上衢與杭諸通車，而諸金，金衢，衢上間，因橋樑過多，不易規復。現在吾人廳以全力奮鬥，以求全路通車。可以告者，下月底或一月初即可通至南昌，全路通車總在明年八九月間。」我們了解這多難的浙贛路，實是工程界一頁實貴的奮鬥史，相信愈經艱苦，其必更加堅强，在千錘百鍊下一定有異樣的光輝。</p>
<p>盧墓三年雕像兩尊</p>
<p>我門邊談邊走，已抵衙州地方。車稍停站間，讓我門入城訪問一審。我們抵孔夫子的奉祀官官宅，要求孔氏捧出孔子雕像一加瞻仰，當即捧了出來，孔夫十與孔夫人都是木頭雕成，每尊闊五寸，長一尺三寸。據孔氏老太太講。「遠在南宋時代，四十六世之嫡系端友公，奉此兩尊雕像也由曲自南渡來此。此雕像爲楷木製成，孔子墓間有楷木，當年子貢　墓三年，以楷木刻成此像，現在孔家已是七十五代了。奉祀官爲孔繁豪，後繁豪物故，遂以弟繁英之子祥楷承繼。」據她吿訴我們：原山東曲阜孔門要她們回去，但因她們已在此居住數代，在願「與親不願與榮」情形下，於是「　　於堂弟一了。比間的奉祀官，戰前奉給爲四百卅元一月，至於到底和現在曲阜的那一位是嫡系？這只有在孔氏家譜與考古家的硏究下決定證實了。</p>
<p>衙州有幾條不平的馬路，綏靖公署設在這裹，店舖還算相當多，當地產桔子與冬筍，橘子需每只一千元，冬筍每斤需價一萬六千元。</p>
<p>地土荒涼人煙益稀</p>
<p>返車站，登車前行，兩邊士地上松樹即將成林，令人喜愛，惟有很多地方，都是沒有人耕種的·一進江西境界，愈顯得荒地更多，人烟更稀。車抵上饒，月台以竹葉竹片編織成棚，亦可說是艱苦經營了。這裏產棗梨，米，油等，大批貨物堆積在站上，據交通人員吿訴我們，每天要有三千噸貨物在這杭州與上饒釣路上走。</p>
<p>車　前行，更見荒涼一片，兩旁山崗起伏，過接嚴山，見山與山間有一巨洞穿通，頗像一個象鼻。車抵楓嶺頭，下車去看坑口的煤礦，這種礦脈係由上　西至橫峯止，藏量有二萬萬么噸，礦用人工開掘，每天約可出煙煤三十多噸，月可產煤千噸，工人有六百多人，礦至鐵路間有輕便鐵道，惟用人力推車運煤。</p>
<p>工業動力迅予復興</p>
<p>據說萍鄉煤礦，戰前日可產煤三千噸，現在不過每月三千噸了·爲了振興浙江的工業，煤是極爲章要的，我們希望游資投到這裏來，迅即開發和復興這工業動力的原料。</p>
<p>再登車前進，抵柄峯站，這是縣境，因爲蘋年兵荒馬亂，縣城裏僅有百戶人家·當地產米，惟終究因爲地廣人稀，所以也沒有大量的出產，再進而抵弋陽站，站距縣城二公裏，問路人縣內人口多少？他們回答也只有二三百戶人家，當地也產米。</p>
<p>以浙江與江西來比，浙江自然要算得小康了。江西，尤其我們所經過的地方，刧後的景象，這赤裸裸的呈在你的眼前，呌你不得不想起當年的浩刧。同時，對現在正努力復興的人起著一種熱烈的敬愛。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<p>馬犯現年五十四歲，原　靖江，寄居武進戴溪橋輔德壇甚久，自民戲二十九年起，馬犯即在惠山文昌閣，以宣揚彿法，動魯行到爲掩護，作邪惡之活動。一設無智愚民，趨之若驚，香火鼎盛，與附近山頭有名三老太所設之佛堂，相映成輝。平日並假名傳授佛經，招收年靑女子，居宿堂內，數年來在當地已有其基礎，組織團體，自稱「無錫康健社宜傳主任」，「先天佛門勸善社主任」，「惠山佫路會理事」，「惠山佛學健康會總督辦」，「中華學佛社敎導兼經理」，頭銜不一，名目繁多，並化名爲馬正鄉，馬正仁，馬玉廷，又號德風。當馬在江陰后塍佈道時，該地復贈以「馬昌賢」之尊號，聲勢可見一斑。</p>
<p>探花法師</p>
<p>本年九月間，江陰縣府逮獲一盜犯朱掌生，乃係當地殺人魔王及採花能手，詎亦爲馬之門徒，當時曾在朱犯身畔，搜出致錫地二情婦之信函：一即爲馬佛堂中之修道女，年當妙齡，後者爲尼姑。信中所稱，除與朱犯自己之愛昧私情外，並涉及馬之姦情，其致玉蓮一函曰：「她是一位千金女，馬昌賢是採花法師，會做出這無恥的事，我在后　，看他的一舉一動，眞一些不差，後又在城溝港聽見妳與靈妹，亦有受其累害的消息，又開西暘橋敬節堂內一位師父告訴我，他也調戲過她們兩人，這才是太白道友不打自招的實感」。致瑞琴一函曰：「輕迭貴堂，　馬姓之名，承蒙憐愛之心，情留一脊，感恩不淺淺……妳也聰明的智識份子，但是馬滑頭諒妳也明白他的。小姐呀，爲何馬昌賢時常到妳們堂中，並且他是採花道友」。馬與二女之私情，紙上畢露矣。</p>
<p>死人復活</p>
<p>最近馬以六百石白米之巨資，在山側另建一佛堂，巳付材料費一百石，餘費則正向附近鄉民募化中。詎即經人吿發被捕。刑警隊曾搜獲先天道之宣傳品「苦海慈航」，及「雷門登天經」。訊其意義，據供爲勸人行善，又於雷門登天經中有「參悟死者復活法」。文曰：「人死莫哭，急用靜地，用一人不言看守至十二時，微微呌喜，用冷水洗面可也。」詢其死人是否能使之復活，則供不得而知。對「先天」二字解釋，謂「是藥書上言講先天後天之說，是我們自悟，用先天名目的。」馬犯容貌傖俗猥琐，頭戴氈帽，身穿土布衣，形如鄉曲，口中時喃喃默念佛號，現刑警隊已於昨晚將馬犯呈解總局偵訊，如訊得有妖人假名活動之嫌疑，即解送縣府軍法室嚴辦。</p>

<h3>馬華在菲旗開得勝</h3>

<h3>汕隊勝利的分析　發揮全盛時代的速率</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕昨夕在市體育館，兩千餘球迷凝神欣賞一塲罕見的精彩緊張的籃球賽。比數之大，也屬空前。</p>
<p>油隊歷盡千辛萬苦，羸得最後勝利，從整個酣戰過程。對美軍托拔卡的實力，有進一層的認識，美軍旨在切磋，未以勝敗爲念。上半時戰至二十二比廿三，美軍精銳商塲，全部生力軍接替，損失六七分之多，下半時力追不及，是托隊昨夕敗陣的原因之一。</p>
<p>鑒於去週華聯曾以三分克托隊，大李並未參戰，汕隊在心理上增加多少自信，而戰略的改變，發揮全盛時代的作戰速率，實爲汕隊制勝的唯一條件，上半時陳淸江的活　得分，全憑供運球快連，遂遙遙領前，下半時陳淸江力竭足傷，紀南康入替，全隊速率大减，倘無林維聽的四十五度在中距離投籃神射，托隊必將超出，毫無疑問。蔡演雄的支配攻勢，馬仔和立德的退守後防，都已盡最大努力。</p>
<p>托隊仍是梅亞，惠培最佳，培漢也有較上週優異的演出。黑人鮑塞昨夕顧前不顧後，使陳淸江接連有從容　入接球投中的鏡頭，當然功不抵過。</p>
<p>拿托被卡和今春過滬的「哥倫布」比擬，顯得前者較　一　，而哥侖在中鋒愛許的身手敏捷，又非梅亞斷能企及。　（昌年）</p>
<p>最後半分鐘決勝負　汕隊勝美軍一分　托披卡七二比七三敗北</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕一幕熱烈緊張之籃球友誼賽，昨晚七時在市體育館舉行，汕隊以一分勝美海軍托披卡。觀衆二千餘人，上半時局勢汕隊陳淸江獨獲十九分。托披卡以梅亞最生動，最初汕隊因太緊張，似難取得聯絡，五分鐘後方見正常狀態，此後汕隊即佔優勢，分數領前，上半時卅六比廿九。下半時愈呈緊張，汕滕苦戰，卒以七十三比七十二寶貴之一分，勝托披卡。戰情如次：</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>攝影開賽，汕隊蔡演雄較彼梅亞幾低一頭，一秒鐘內托披卡培漢一托而入，大顯身手。汕隊廔探未中，但見球在籃圈上盤旋。立德維聽力戰，以七比四追出。水兵大調人馬，十一分平手。雙方各顯射籃妙技，汕隊以十七比十五領前二分，形勢隊變，汕隊廿三比廿二又超出一分。水兵再行全部更動，汕隊保持優勢，上半時汕隊以卅六比廿九領前，</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>托披卡多夾袋人物，下半時仍以上塲五將應戰，以逸待勞。水兵急起直追，打成四十分平手。四十六比四十一時，林維聰替出陳淸江，又造成各五十五。汕隊以六十一比五十一佔先，四座歡呼。番將再以四人入替，又成六十二七十一平手。林維聰遠射，七十三比七十一超出，蔡犯規畢業，何立德入代，托披卡梅亞罰中，鐘聲起處，七十三比七十二，汕隊以僅有之一分勝利。</p>
<p>汕隊　犯　分陳淸江　三　廿五林維聽　三　廿六何立　　一　十一紀南康　一　五蔡演雄　五　四馬燦希　二　二合計　十五　七三</p>

<h3>編者的希望</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>本週刋自十二月起準備充寬內容，擴充篇輻，這一方面足見本報總編輯部提倡學術之精神，另一方面也是由於本刋讀者的熱心愛護。當此工昂紙貴之際，我們這般喜歡讀書的朋友們便感覺到不勝買書的負担。有此人也許跑到書坊間略事閱覽，但是看得太久了，書坊的夥計們也許會對你「另眼看待」，因此，也就不便久留。即使稍有買書能力的讀者們也不能把所有的書都買來看。因此，本刋負有兩種使命：　介紹內容；　批評優劣。當我們介紹一本書的內容時，第一，我們當然要揀好書；第二，我們要提鍊全書的精華；第三，我們自己的介紹文也應該是一篇良好的散文或短篇小說。當我們批評一本書的優劣時，第一，我們要力除私人的恩怨；第二，我們不但要揚善而且不要隊惡；第三，我們對於所批評的這一門一定要有所專長的，我們的批評要有正確的學理根據的。</p>
<p>以上是編者和許介者所自勉的幾點。我們自信我們雖然沒有達到我們的理想，但是我們是趨向於這一方面的。近來我們收到的稿子是相當的好，寫作者也是有所專長。編者的選擇也是很嚴的。本刋以前所登載的稿子百分之九十的作者是編者所不認識的。但我們也不埋歿靑年作家的作品。我們鼓勵靑年讀書，鼓勵他們讓後寫點心得，投寄本刋，我們總是擇優登載的。</p>
<p>本週刋的內容是希望多方面平衡發展的，關於小說的評介稿子我們收到的最多。這類稿子最容易寫，可是最不容易寫得優美。以後每期我們希望能够多登一簾，因爲讀者們也是比較的喜歡讀這一類的文章，關於介紹自然科學書藉的稿子比較的少，但多能用。不過我們希望寫這類稿子的先生們再介紹一些高深科學理論和通俗實用科學的書籍，而行文略爲文藝化一點。最奇怪的是我們收到的關於社會科學或人文科學的稿子最少。我想這也許是因爲在這一方面的名著近來出版的太少。但是我們也歡迎介紹歷史上在哲學和社會學方面的中西名著。</p>
<p>總之，我們甚願本刋不祇是一種「圖書備要」，而是一種富有學術性的刊物，我們的興趣是高超而多方面的；我們的態度是審愼而客觀的，我們在學理上的立場是主張嚴厲批判辯證的，但絕對鄙視有私人的恩怨，夾雜其間，最後我們希望作家多多的給我們稿件，讀者繼續的鼓勵和指導我們。</p>
<h3>兒童繪畫心理</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>殷兀（Helga　Eng）著　龔啟昌譯　商務印書館發行</p>
<p>一般兒童繪畫的敎師，往往用養成人的眼光去衡量兒童的作品，結果，這種生動活潑的兒童繪畫的發表能力，便遏止住了。想使一般敎師能够留心一下兒童繪畫的心理，研究一下，這種反敎育的手法，自然會消失的。</p>
<p>對於兒童繪畫心理的硏究，在國內敎育出版物中，我們往往可以養見一些短章零篇，而作有系統的專門研究的結果，只有黃　著「兒童繪畫之心理」（商務版）和我現在介紹的一本，前者是一個用團體法的硏究報吿，擬於下次介紹，這一本，是著者用傳記法硏究她的姪女馬格麗德（Mlargaret）繪畫心理的結果，再參入譯者個人在中央大學實臉學校的兒童畫研究成果編譯改寫而成，並不是一個完整的譯本。</p>
<p>我又在另一個地方得到一本日譯本，是大友一三與國際書房編輯部合譯的，那是完全的。照日譯本看，殷兀的原著，是分列四章，即：一，最初一筆到八歲的彩色　。二，兒童畫心理發達槪觀。三，表現精神發達的兒實畫。四，兒童與原始藝術。</p>
<p>但在　譯的書裏　，他只譯了她的第二章，再參入自己的硏究，而成爲下面幾個項目：</p>
<p>引言。　塗鴉。　自塗鴉至象形晝。象形畫。　自動力。　方向。　透視或配景。　比例。　動作。　顏色。　　裝飾。</p>
<p>在「塗鴉」的名稱之下，發現兒童的表達只用三種綫，即：　浪動式的亂塗。　圓圈形的亂塗。　雜亂無章的亂塗。</p>
<p>在「自塗鴉至象形畫」的一個時期，兒童必然會把所畫的東西給予某種事物的名稱，或者在動手之前，宣布他要書的是什麽。</p>
<p>「象形畫」的一節中，叙述了賽人物的發達次序，就是先畫頭，繼晝身體，脚，最後才書手臂的情形，以及描書動物，植物，房屋等的次序。</p>
<p>所謂「自動力」，是繪晝的重複次數到了一個相當足够的數目以後，繪畫的過程，就變得十分機械，這就成爲一種「自動力」。也就是指繪畫正在過渡到新格式而仍不離舊格式的時候的現象。比如在側面的人像上，兒童往往會畫出二個眼睛，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>「方向」的一節裘，是指出兒童繪畫中位置顚倒的錯誤的現象與原因。爲了兒童觀察世界的結構比成人稍欠習慣，而這種現象，大約產生在兒童所不知的新形體中。</p>
<p>「透視與配景」，在本節裏頭斷定兒童繪畫中是不能表示的，而透視的表現，須依賴於抽象感覺之發達程度和複雜的自然綜合能力，因之，透視方法與繁複景物之綜合表現，兒童一直要到十四歲才有可能。</p>
<p>在兒童繪畫中缺乏正確的比例，在某一形體的各部關係，或是人與物的組合關係上是常見的。「比例」一節中，說明兒童們還沒有充分的綜合能力，便不能獲得整個觀念的綠故。</p>
<p>關於「動作」這個行爲，使得我們能够淸楚辨別，大約要在十六歲兒童的繪畫中才會發現出來。</p>
<p>兒童繪畫的「顏色」運用，大約要在八歲才有辦法，在五六歲時，總是喜歡用沒有顏色的輪廓來畫出事物之普通形式。在這一節裏，譯者更參入了兒童對於顏色愛好的硏究結果：選擇次數最多的是黃色，次藍色，再次綠色，以及其他各色的選擇次數。（筆者也有相似的研究，編入於拙作「色彩學研究」—商務版）</p>
<p>在「裝飾」的一節中，說明早期的兒童繪畫沒有精美的自創的裝飾，因爲，記述式的繪畫是早早就發現了，而裝璜式的晝，至少要在六歲以後始有地位，</p>
<p>著者在進行研究的時候，並採擇了許多專家的意見和結果做參證，而譯者雖然未將全書譯出，但很仔細地把自己硏究的結果滲透進去，却也是値得讚美的。著者股兀女士，是挪成人，是一個權成的心理學家，不但對兒童晝有深切的硏究，對兒童語言與感情也有豐富的研究。</p>
<h3>戰後交通建設概論</h3>
<p>— 鵬</p>
<p>趙曾珏著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>我們中國在戰後第一件大事是建設。關於建設方針，時賢多所論列：有的主張國防第一，應先建設國防，有的主張民生第一，應先建設民生，也有主張工業比農業重要，應實行工業化，或主張農業比工業重要，應以農立國的。究竟孰是孰非，此處不預備討論，但有一點必須提出，即無論建設什麽，都少不了交通，有了交通，一切纔能迅速順利建設起來。舉個眼前的例，現在日本賠償我們的工義設備數百萬噸就需要適量的船隻，纔能把它運回來，而此點於我們就有問題的。所以我們可以說交通建設是一切建設之基礎，在建設的程序上，比一切建設都重要。</p>
<p>交通部在抗戰期間，對於戰後交通建設已經動員許多專家，經過很大的時間，製成交通建設綱領草案，提經中央設計局審定，以備實施。本書著者趙曾珏先生其時担任交通部郵電司長兼中央設計局設計委員，曾參加這個綱領的製作，所以現在將這個綱領連同他個人的著作以及其他有關重要文獻，輯成此書。據他在本書弁言裏說，因鑒於交通建設之重要，所以乘此戰後建設正待開始，編著此書，給學術以繼續研討的資料，這實在是極有意義</p>
<p>全書共九編五十一章。第一編包括建設綱領，實施原則及綱領與原則的總說明，對於鐡路，公路，航業，民用航空，電信，郵政等六大建設綜合地作原則的規劃；第二編對於戰後五年上述六項建設作具體的計劃；以下各編則分別討論各項建設，其主張有的與綱領相同，正可作爲綱領的補充說叫有的雖屬不同，但亦足以資比較研究。由北可見編著者輯錄資料時，已費了一番斟酌的。</p>
<p>那個綱領草案是全書最重要部份，它是確實根據理論復顧全現實，而擬訂的一種改良的進步的整個計劃。以下介紹其幾個要點：</p>
<p>交通事業應配合國家經濟建設交通建設旣爲一切建設之基礎，則應與一切建設相配合，然後方可助長其發展其理由是很簡單的。今按綱領第一條云：「交通建設以供給安全便利而價康之運輸與通信設備爲公衆服務，促進國家工業化，增進人民福利，並補助國家文化之發展爲目標」，它實在對戰後亟待建設的民生和國防都已顧到，因爲民生與國防建設的前提是工業化，今交通建設的目標旣爲促進國家工業化，即所以促進民生和國防建設了。更有一點，過去我們的交通雞設額嫌偏枯不齊，就是注重都市而忽略了農村，注重東南地區而忽略了大後方；而且同是交通事業，如鐵路，水運，公路和空運相互間，電信和郵政相互間，也缺少應有的配合聯繫。但在新計劃中，道些弊病都給矯正過來了。</p>
<p>行政與業務應劃分及業務應企業化　過去我們的交通最高行政機關一方面執行國家交通政策，一方面自己也在辦理交通業務，實在是不合理的。現在綱領則將行政與業務劃分，使最高行政機關專管行政，而另設業務管理機關，受其監督管理業務，以保持行政的一元化，至對於業務機關則主張盡量企業化，以增高效率，這些都是進步的辨法。</p>
<p>規定交通事業國營公營和民營的界限　一國交通事業應採何種經營方式，要看它的政治制度，經濟能力和國防地位而定。我們過去的交通事業，有的國營，有的民營，並無一定標準，以致中央和地方，或政府與人民，時常發生衝突，甚至中央機關及地方機關相互間亦發生衝突，其影響所及，足以阻碍交通事業的發展。現在這個綱領對於各項交通事業，何者應國營，何者應公營，何者應民營，或何者除國營公營之外兼許民營，都作硬性的規定，如是，非但將來在執行上因有標準可據而感到便利，而且這些規定根本是合理的。</p>
<p>規定外資的吸收方式　我們在戰後辦建設，必須利用外資，其理由無俟贅論。但是我們需要外資，應當有一定條件和一定方式，否則無異飲鴆止渴，是外資利用我們，而非我們利用外資了。現在這個綱領所規定的吸收外資方式分爲：（甲）發行債票，（乙）一般信用或材料借款，（丙）股份合資，（丁）特許經營等四種，其精義所在，一爲統籌支配，二爲依法管理，比較過去的各交通事業個別借款，個別負責，只顧眼前，不顧將來的作風，實在進步得多了。從前借款修築鐵路，借誰的款，就用誰的機車，誰的工程師，誰的工程規範，其結果使我們的微路成了世界鐵路博覽會，在運輸上和管理上發生重大因難。今後照新規定辦理，此種現象就不至再有發生。而且，新綱領規定以往交通債務由中央統一整理歸償，以樹債信，亦是最賢明的辦法。</p>
<p>其他如統一工程規範，統一管理制度，都有扼要的規定，此處不再贅述。我們相信，看了本書，對於我們戰後交通建設的遠景，可得到一個鮮明的輪廓。至今日爲止，國內討論交通建設，有正確理諭，有具體計劃的專門著作，本書尙爲第一本！</p>
<h3>馬先生談算學</h3>
<p>— 中浣</p>
<p>（開明靑年業書之一，劉薰宇著。）</p>
<p>這一本「馬先生談算學」，和其他許多劉先生蔣著的書一樣，是用「故事的方式」來說理的，很淸楚地表出了學習算學的態度，思素問題的途徑，以及探究題目間的關係和變化的方法，牠絕對不是什麽難題詳解之類，要是某人爲了找尋某一個問題的解法來翻牠，這也許會使人失望的，雖然這裏面收集了一百多個題目而加以解釋。</p>
<p>然而筆者之願意極誠懇地介紹這一太書，是在於牠解法的奇特，這一本書，從頭到尾，是用圖解法來計算任何的題目的，這是普通算學書中所及不到的，也是本書最引人入勝的地方，用　解法來解決算學問題，不但便於觀察，而且可以使算術更切於實用。圖解本已溝通了代數幾何而造成了解析幾何，現在作者又把牠運用在算術之中，不但有助於進修數學，就是對於學習理工科乃至於統計也頗有益。</p>
<p>本畫共分三十章，包括時鐘問題，流水問題，年齡問題，鳥獸同羣等四則題，它幷且說明比例和分數之所以適合於初一學生之用，因爲這時候他們正在複習算術之中。此外，初學解析幾何的人讀了，可以提高對於解析幾何的興趣。</p>
<p>算術是一切高等數學，代數，三角，解幾乃至微積分的基礎，不容我們忽視。這一本不可多得的好書我希望靑年們能够多多予以利用。</p>
<h3>讀冰瑩的「離婚」</h3>
<p>— 紀平</p>
<p>無題集小說之一　晨光公司出版</p>
<p>人生是痛苦的，它永遠在重疊的磨難下不斷地和自己，和家庭，和社會，和整個的人類掙扎。尤其女性，更尤其有着眞摯的戀情與淸哳的理智的女性，卻將千萬倍於一般人所曾承受過的痛苦。</p>
<p>謝冰瑩女士在「離婚」中，以日記體裁展露女性的苦難，是越加深切地證明了它底實性。</p>
<p>是偶然的，在朋友底書架上發現了這本裝訂得非常精美的無題集，離婚是其中的一個中篇小說，全集包含有十二位女作家最近所寫的十二篇創作，是趙淸閣女士主編的。有好幾位女作家輟筆了許多時候，特地爲了這本「現代中國女作家，小說專集」才重新提華的，從道裏，我們可以非常淸晰地瞻仰到中國女作家最近的英姿。</p>
<p>翻開畫第一篇閱讀就是「離婚」也是因爲許久沒有看到冰瑩先生短篇劍作，而且，目前的中國社會也在演者這種悲劇。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：一位中學畢業，在家爲子女操勞了近十年的女主人翁王曼茵，因爲不願妨礙正在前綫作戰的丈夫吳國强的工作，毅然不辭辛苦地領養三個孩子在後方和生活掙扎，自以爲愛情結合的丈夫永遠忠實於她，整天含辛茹苦地盼待着勝利後的團聚。事實却沒有因爲她底堅貞使她如願，悲劇也就從這裏開始了。國强在前方和舞女同居的消息迫使她不得不趕向火綫，在奔波的途中所懷的好夢被事實無情地敲得粉碎。曼茵被棄了！而且，十分悲慘。國强予她以無限的精神上的損害和壓抑，爲了「面子」竟堅決地拒絕曼茵在悲痛的絕望中的最米一個要求「離婚」。他不但耍曼茵維特表而上的夫婦關係，而且更以武力阻止她與任何一個男性接近。曼茵底自尊心促使她努力新生，她要求自出，獨立而偷快的生活，雖然被孩子絆住了脚也掙扎着進了「會計學校」。因爲經濟獨立的先決條件是知能的充實。敎成本會計的殷先生，一位二十多歲的，學問，人品，都很良好的靑年，起初是關心曼茵，繼而是由於愛熱而表白以書信欲爲曼茵的小弟弟。但是，國强旣沒有與她辦離婚手續，社會也不給她以自由的權利，被傳統力量壓抑了千萬年的女性，縱使在絕望的悲苦生活裏掙扎也不敢，也不能去接受新的愛情。而且曼茵底堅貞依然被國强所羞辱，股幾乎在國强底手槍下喪命。爲了國强一再的欺壓，爲了國强的過分冷酷的漠視，曼茵，這位被遺棄的倔强的女性，更爲了自己底自由毅然決然地單獨登報，聲明與吳國强正式離婚，自己帶着孩子走向伸展在面前的新的道路。爲了股的安全，爲了殷的將來的幸福，也爲了曼茵的對於殷的愛護，她隱忍了一切的哀痛，悄悄地遠離了股，獨自和生活去作持久的掙扎。</p>
<p>的確，曼茵，不渦是萬千不幸女性中的一個富有奮鬥精神的苦難者罷了，在同一時間，同一空間，眞不知還有多少千萬的婦女在忍受着同樣的磨難，不，在忍受着更甚於曼茵的磨難。</p>
<p>這是一個問題，一個嚴重的屬於全人類幸福的社會問題。冰榮先生將牠更具體地剖落在我們面前了。</p>
<p>不可否認的，這還是一個畸形的社會，一個以男性爲中心的社會。雖然「反封建」，「反禮敎」的呼聲早被一般自命爲上進的人視爲陳舊的歷史遺跡了，但，封建社會裏所生長出來的禮敎，依然毫不留情的在「吃人」，不過吃得更文明，更巧妙了。</p>
<p>如果說，人間還有一點眞正公平而又普遍的東西存在的話，那就是陽光和感情了，不管是擁有百億財富的巨商，還是一貧如洗的乞兒，他們都一樣的被太陽俯照着。感情，也如此，它決不會有絲毫勢利與階級的區分，任何一個人都有他她底眞　的感情，其所以表現得不同的，自然又是這個文明社會裏的種種敎條所綑束的功效了。</p>
<p>所不幸的是：在同一的客觀環境裏，衡量於男性的是一個天秤，衝量於女性的，却又是另外一個出自男性手中的天秤。</p>
<p>因此，曼茵所受的內心的矛盾與痛苦也就更深一層了。她還不能超然於人世，還像罪犯一樣的連看一封「情書」的勇氣也沒有，她在被棄以後還念念不忘於自己底被「傳統力量」所固定的妻子的天賦，還這樣凄凉而惶恐的在對着她丈夫的照片自語。</p>
<p>「國强不是站在壁上嗎？他睜着限睛怒視着我，好像要一口吞下我的模樣。我恐懼，我戰慄……」</p>
<p>終於，也不敢接受的眞正的愛靑。</p>
<p>但，歷史總是向前的，人類底脚步也總是朝着光亮的地方萬去，沒有暗黑的永夜，自然也不會有走不到盡頭的泥潭小路。</p>
<p>正如冰瑩先生在最後所指示出來的，借曼茵底筆所呼喊於全體女性的警語：</p>
<p>「我明白了，女人的理智要能戰勝情感，才不做愛情的俘虜；女人要有思想，要能够經濟獨立，才不受男人的壓迫；她應該時時刻刻想到有一條自己必走的路，不倚賴別人，完全我自己的力量走去！」</p>
<p>健全看自己的本身吧！一生之中，本來也只有痛苦和磨難才是眞正的實在，其他的一切，不過都是虛幻。</p>
<p>但，惟其只有痛苦和磨難是眞正的實在，我們才加倍的鍛鍊自己，使自己有更堅靱的勇毅來跋涉前面的舖滿了苦難的路途。</p>
<p>「前面擱着的是一條新的道路，不管是康莊大路的坦途也好，不管是荆棘縱橫的小路也好，我總得大膽地勇敢地走去……」</p>
<p>是的，總得大膽地勇敢地走去！</p>
<p>依靠着自己吧！依靠着自己的信念和努力，路，總會被人走出來的。</p>
<p>願萬千不幸的女性，在冰瑩先生的筆下得到無限深摯的同情，與艱苦奮鬥的毅力！</p>

<h3>談信念</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死。」何謂「心死」呢？就是對奮鬥失去了勇氣，也就是對自己的目標失去了信念。</p>
<p>失去了自信的個人，在行爲上表現出來的大槪有兩大類：一是澈頭澈尾的失敗主義，處處畏葸退縮，時時覺得別人在欺凌他：自歎「十有九人堪白眼，百無一用是書生」者即屬此類；另一種則表現於暴戾恣睢的虐待狂——以對弱者的暴行來掩飾自己的動搖，徬徨。試看日本兵在敗耗頻傳的時候，對倫陷區的老百姓就格外猜忌殘酷，就是一個明白的例子。</p>
<p>去年冬天，筆渚會和一位久居中國的美國老法官談起中國的前途，那位老法官慨然道：「我並不覺得有什麼特別令人悲哀或者不放心之處。美國也曾經過南北戰爭，結果是在戰事結束之後，美國還是美國！」</p>
<p>最近，看到英國政府稱種措施，更使人感愧無地。在這次大戰中，大英帝國可說是一舉而失盡了殖民地，人民正遭受着普遍的窮困和飢餓，而政府始終堅定不移，一榮「不患寡而患不均」的方針，引導着堅苦卓絕的不列顚人民們步步前進。食糧的配給屢次减少，而經濟政策的執行者克里浦斯登高一呼，昭吿全國國民說：「英國各種基本工業的產量都已經造成了新紀錄，英國已經度過了最危險的階段，以後就是否極泰來的時候了。」</p>
<p>如果說我們現在亟需自力更生的話，那麽英國實在是一個量好的模範。我們必需信賴自己，才能眞正掌握自己的命運。祇要我們能用事實來表現我們確願自助，我們是決不會孤獨的。</p>

<h3>夢遊篇</h3>
<p>— 農尼</p>
<p>裕公從去年秋天起，前後曾函邀我赴西子湖作小遊，至少有五六次之多，我可因爲缺乏優游歲月的豪情，也就嬾得出門，一直躭延下來，而且不知道將在什麽日子才可以了却道一個塵綠。</p>
<p>道並不是說我沒有對湖山的愛情，相反的，倒是因裕公的邀約而平添了多少的夢，我只覺得我雖隔離着西子，但西子並沒有隔離着我。臥遊之際，我曾默默記誦：</p>
<p>「西湖無。不入我蒙中，而夢中之西湖實未　一日別余也。」</p>
<p>不僅是這樣，有時我更有權利可以高歌，或者低唱起來：</p>
<p>「我夢中所有者，反爲西湖所無？」</p>
<p>誰說雷峯塔是倒塌了的古蹟？我認爲它在我的夢中是完整如故，自無需乎重修。此刻冬猶未深，我却在夢中晤見了「斷橋殘雪」。「柳浪聞鶯」啦，「平湖秋月」啦……就現在而論，似乎都是不合時宜的好景，但在我的夢中却還是嚦嚦可聞，期朗普照着。是的，夢裏的西湖，實在是，讓我吿訴您：它顯得最完整，最鮮明，最壯闊，最美好。</p>
<p>童年早已去得遙遙，落在我的背後了，但童年時期深印在湖山上的展痕，該是永遠抹不去的吧？朋友一年來的柬邀的盛情，也一定是深深地銘刻着的吧？</p>
<p>那麼，我又何不繼續臥遊下去。我正不妨低吟：「而今而後，余但向蝶庵岑寂，麗榻紆徐，惟吾舊夢是保：一派西湖景色，猶端然未動也。」</p>
<p>然而，故國多難，西子眞的是端然未動嗎？作夢遊篇以報裕公，但願能吿我以新的消息。</p>
<h3>談蛇</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>生物學家吿訴我們，蛇是沒有耳朵的；那麽，牠們對於週遭的動靜以及敵害，怎麽探察的呢？</p>
<p>我們時常看見一條蛇，在游行停止時，馬上從口中吐出兩根綫狀的鬚來，約有三寸模樣的長度，伸出又縮進，縮進又伸出，向蛇頭前的三個方向——左方右方和正前，不住地一伸一縮；當再度向前衝游時，則兩根錢狀的鬚就含藏在口裏，看不見了；同時在被迫逐而感受威脅與恐慌時，那麼，道兩根綫狀的鬚就伸縮得更勤，動作也更快捷，似乎在起着一種極大極重要的作用。</p>
<p>據生物學家研究的結果，這綫狀的鬚是蛇的舌頭，在靜止時，在恐慌中，不住地伸縮探察，這是以舌代耳；因爲牠們的舌頭上邊，有許多感覺靈敏，小到極點的神經突起，這些小突起，可以探測週遭的聲波，及其他一切的震動，藉知實際情况，而找一個比較安全的方向逃開。</p>

<p>幾年以前，哈佛大學的一位心理學敎授舉行了一次測驗。先後受測騐的人數，共達一千四百八十四人。道位敎授把某一支交響樂的兩套唱演奏給他們聽，請他們判斷那一套較好，他同時解釋說一般批評家覺得是第二套好一些。結果百分之五十九的人都覺得果然是第二套演奏得好——祇有百分之四的人說出了眞相：這兩套片子其實是完全一樣的。</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆　醇王至病與死</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>據黃任之考證：西太后係生於雅安（舊屬四川，今屬西康）。故秉有西南邊區之山野性，與生於四川廣元之武則天，先後若相合焉。此嫗在滿淸末葉，問事達四十七年之久，其影響於中國歷史之變動，不可謂不鉅，顧至今尙無人爲撰一公正而完備之評傳，亦當世治史者之失職也。</p>
<p>欲寫西太后，不可忘却尙有一耿直而懦弱之小人物，比附於此嫗之裙邊而了其一生，則所謂醇賢親王奕職是。</p>
<p>淸道光帝生九子，以大位傳於其第四子奕詝，即咸豐也。咸鹽即位後，弟兄之殘存者，僅五弟奕誴（惇王）六弟突訢（恭王），七弟奕　（醇王）。此三人性格不同，而皆不爲咸豐所喜。惇性躁動，對政治無興趣，其所過生活，完全爲無進步之旗裔生活。恭較機敏深沉，有政治野心，而好財貨。醉則平實重感情，爲「半歇斯迭里」性的，比之諸兄，人性最爲充足，故西太后收其子戰湉（光緒）爲帝，輒跪地叩首痛哭，非必矯爲此狀，實父子天親之愛不能割也。</p>
<p>西太后當政後，以權利衝突，最惡恭王，而以醇王福晋爲已胞妹，別有私親關係，輒欲軒醇以輊恭，顯自同治死，光緒立，醇王頗畏事不敢出，又短於才略，政治上無可　揮。光緒十年，四后　命恭王退出軍機，並其私黨賓鋆李鴻藻悉逐去。而別諭軍機，遇大事則先諮於醇王，直公關以醇代恭矣。惟以後數年間，直至光緒十六年逝世，彼迄不能有所作為，其勉強可稱道者，「鼓勵海軍建設」與「人事上支持左宗棠」二事而已。</p>
<p>西太后初雖喜醇，而自發現光緒與己異趣，開始因光緒故而並憎及醇，於是醉王漸以病聞。此翁之病與死，在淸末政治史上成爲一謎。先大父銘三先生，以目修精於醫理　光緒十三年，方卸鄂難事　南京，得李合肥自天津發機電，召赴北京為視醇王疾。即至，館於醇抵試圖，驗太醫院方，殊怳忽，莫知所措手。一日，甫問脈，光緒忽奉西太后至，西后間先大父姓名訖，曰：「張某方，宜送內務府前醫視之。」大父知旨，次日遂已病瀉辭　。過天津，謁合肥曰：「太醫方，與七王病不想和，奈何！」合肥憮然而已。惟是年醇王病旋愈，更三年，始死。翁常熟日記光緒十六年十一月二十一日云：「聞醇邸逝，趨入請安，上嗷然長號，臣等亦失聲，面對服色凡四條，出與萊山改定禮部稿十二條，遂定購。」</p>
<h3>從纏腳談起</h3>
<p>— 馮允莊</p>
<p>今日婦女之成爲問題，似乎還是男人給想出並提出來的。婦女本身在數千年來已經習慣了「以順爲正」的所謂婦德，因此男人要她們纏足，她們便纏起足來；如今男人又要呌她們動腦筋想起婦女問題來了，她們當然仍舊是「無違夫子」的。</p>
<p>男人為什麼會想到婦女問題呢？因爲他們先想到了「社會問題」。想到了整個社會需要合理化，整個人類應該是「平等」而且「自由」的，謝謝他們還不曾忘記婦女也是人，所以便主張婦女應該起來爭取自由平等了。換言之，也就是婦女該解放出來。</p>
<p>假使個個男人都認爲婦女是應該自由平等的，應該解放的，婦女問題業就不成其為問題了。問題在於舊制度，舊觀念，就習慣還不能完全改革或打破，所以有的認爲應該爭取，有的認爲不應該爭取，應該維持。至於婦女自己究竟作何想法呢？我以爲大多數無知識或知識不足的婦女恐怕是祗有一個想法，即如何能嫁到一個丈夫，而且丈夫又是好的，便一切婦女問題都解決了。</p>
<p>知識婦女也未必不足如此想。但却未必敢說出口來。因爲依賴丈夫的思想是落伍的，而她們希望自己要變成摩登的。于是高等姨太太之流就自以爲幸福了，在她們身上根本發生不出來婦女問題。而且婦女問題解決了于地們倒反而不好，試問誰願意在寒冷的早晨起來，離開席夢思，而去辛辛苦苦地工作求自立乎？</p>
<p>就是一般其他種類的知識婦女也都比較是幸福的。至少她們已經有了求知識的機會。也就是說她們的父母是比較有錢及思想開　的。他們總不至於受到十分嚴重的壓迫。眞正受壓迫的婦女與眞正受壓迫的窮人一般，她們祗希望能苟延殘喘，那裏還能够想到問題不問題，即什麽呌做自由。平等。獨立。解放之類？</p>
<p>然則這婦女問題也同其他社會問題一般，是不很需要解決的人，替他們自以為很需要解決的人們所代提出來的。是否被認爲應該需要的婦女眞需要解決遭問題呢？至少在目前種種現象看來，婦女自己來談這問題的人祇有這幾類：第一是盲從男人主張的摩登婦女；第二上受到婚姻痛苦，或已失掉配偶的中年婦女；第三是什麽人生經騐都沒有，祇愛標新立異的知識婦女；第四是專門研究社會問題之類的女學者；……總之，談婦女問題的婦女祗是部分的而不是全體的，而且在道些人中，其眞正能有自由平等獨立解放的思想及行動的更是百不得一。</p>
<p>此「婦女問題」之所以仍舊成爲問題也。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第一章　喜得知音　（四）</p>
<p>到得晚上七點半鐘左右，渚齋坐單到廣播電台，車子經過三座門，在暮色微茫中，突由後面趕上一輛三輪車，點着兩盞雪亮車燈，車上女客，對渚齋把手一舉道：「是徐先生嗎？我家是十二號門牌。」說時，車子倐的往前駛去，渚齋在倉卒間覺得和他說話的似是綺紈，可惜未及答覆，他的車子已飛馳而去。自己到了廣播電台，在播聲室裏唱了一段玉堂春，唱完才有八點半鐘，心想時間還早，不如到綺紈家裏拜訪，今晚廣播，她一定收聽了，請敎她唱得怎麼樣，彼此研究硏究，看她對我的印象還不壊。</p>
<p>想着，出了電台，雇車一逕到校場二條，這時天色很黑，胡同內又暗無燈光，渚齋下車之後，査出好幾家，都不對，最後在東邊一家小門，站着一個小孩子，渚齋向他問道：「小兄弟，我給你打聽打聽，十二號在那裏？」那孩子道：「我不知道。」渚齊道：「道　有姓顧的沒有？「孩子道：「對過不就是姓顧嗎？」渚齊急走到對門一看，門柱上隱約似寫着「顧宅」二字，在黑暗裏，也辨不淸，輕輕向門上一敵，裏面一個當差出來，渚齋告訴他要見顧綺紈老板，那當差道：「這裏是顧大老板住宅，顧綺紈老板是住在對過。」說着，把門砰了一聲關上。</p>
<p>渚齊再回到對過，那小孩子已不見了，此時心裏有點焦燥，也不管是不是綺紈住宅，在門上連連敵了幾下，裏面一個老太太開門出來。渚齊說要找顧綺紈，老太太轉身進去，喊道：「顧老板有人找。」立時由裏面走出一個小大姐，渚齊一看，就是早晨在公園所見的那個，那小大姐向渚齊端詳一下，向渚齋問道：「你貴姓？」渚齋道：「我姓徐，顧老板在家嗎？」小大姐道：「顧老板不在家。」渚齊一聽，很是失望，暗忖綺紈不在家，我是空來一趟，站在門口猶豫不決，小大姐又道：「顧老板有電話來說：有位徐先生來時，請到裏面坐，顧老板一會就回來。」渚齋一聽。好似打了一支强心針，立時又興奮起來。跟着小大姐說道：「我姓徐，我姓徐！」小大姐笑了一笑，領他進去。渚齋一君，院內是一所四合房子，東西房沒有燈光，南房雖有燈光，隔窗幔罩着，透着陰暗，祇有北室有電燈，開得雪亮。小大姐打開門簾，讓渚齊進去，一看正室二間打通，布置一個小客室，幾張沙發，一個書架，一張書桌，布置很簡單，那小大姐端上茶來，隨向渚齋瞧了兩眼，又走進去，一會又拿出香烟來，抽了一枝遞給渚齊。渚齊搖搖頭道：「我不會。」小大姐笑了笑，便站在旁邊。渚齋對她細細一看，一張瓜子險，彎彎眉毛，小小的嘴，五官配置，非常平勻，臉上不施脂粉，天生粉　皮　，覺得像這樣甜俏白凈的小大姐，在北方還是少見的。</p>
<h3>觀點</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>前天，我去拜訪好久不見的老李。老李還沒有回家，我就和老李的太太聊起天來。</p>
<p>話題從天氣轉到了小姐太太們的新裝。李太太笑了起來，問我：「你看見沙法上那件絨衫短襖麼？啊，你們男人們的脾氣眞古怪！」</p>
<p>我當然就急急追問，絨綫衫和男人的脾氣有甚麽關係。</p>
<p>李太太愈想愈好笑了。她說：「上兩個禮拜，我和我們李先生一同去看夜塲電影，天氣怪凉快的，我們就慢慢走回家了。剛走過一條冷靜馬路的時候，我就瞧見路燈下有一個怪淸秀的靑年人，老是對我那件新的絨短襖看着—李先生倒彷彿也有此看出來了。那晚上我的頭髮邊上插者一朶大紅花，跟這件淺藍的棧衫配在一起，倒眞是有些引人家注目是不是？不想那個不知進退的大孩子竟走上前來拉拉李先生的袖子，說是要借個火抽烟。李先生可眞光了火，他把那個人一推，隨身就檢起了一塊磚頭，砰的一下，竟把那個人一下子打得昏了過去！」</p>
<p>我說：「老李的醋勁可眞利害！他敢情是多喝了一盅罷？」</p>
<p>她聳了聳肩頭：「老李早就不喝酒了。周先生，你可不要見氣，我看你們男人的脾氣可實在有些兒怪。」</p>
<p>等了半天，老李不來，我就吿辭了。剛走到馬路轉角，碰着了老李。</p>
<p>「喂，老李，你怎麽近來喜歡用磚頭打人了？」</p>
<p>他哈哈大笑起來。「你準是碰到過我內人了。那天在馬路上檢到那塊磚頭，可眞是運氣！你想，那晚上我身邊的現鈔就有兩百多萬，這倒還是小事，你看我手臂上那只愛爾琴金錶，十八開，還是我自己去年從美國帶回來的。我太太還帶着一只三克拉的鑽戒！」</p>
<p>「這樣說來，那個傢伙是存心不良，想搶東西了。」</p>
<p>「怎麽不是！你想，深更半夜，那條馬路是這樣冷僻，忽然旁邊跳出一個人來，抓住了你的手臂問你討洋火，還會安着什麽好心眼！」</p>
<p>我覺得他的話也有些道理，於是，我們就分手了……</p>
<p>「老周，別跑！」忽然後面有一個人在呌我。回頭一看，是半個多月沒見面的老同學小王。</p>
<p>「啊呀，小王你怎麽頭上給人打得這個樣子！我早就吿訴你：到了咱們這年紀，就該安分守己，在家納福，你偏是愛踢足球，這回準是輸了球外加再挨了打，是不是？」</p>
<p>小王對我瞪了一眼，說：「暍酒去了。</p>
<p>在酒店裏，小王歎了口氣說：「說起來這件事還和老兄有關。半個月之則，我從親戚家裏喝了喜酒出來，一看天高氣爽，月亮高高掛在半天，怪有意思，倒有些不忍回家睡覺了。雅興一來，就想你是個半夜工作的人，何妨到報館裏來找你談談。一路上就想抽烟，可就偏偏的把我那只打火機忘在家裏。正在無可奈何之間，忽然看見有一個西裝筆挺的男人帶着一個奇醜無比，俗不可耐的女人，搖搖擺擺而來。那個男人的嘴裏正好也含着香烟。我就上前去客客氣氣地向他討根火柴，不想那個像伙竟然神經病大發，拿起了磚頭對準了我頭上就是那麽一下！」</p>
<p>他一口暍乾了一杯，搖搖頭說，「也怪我自己不好，太不小心。那個地方原來正在一家瘋人院的前面，這一對當然無疑的是瘋人院裏剛剛逃出來的瘋子！」</p>
<p>回到報館裏，我馬上就找半個月前的舊報。本埠新聞裏有一條短訊：「昨日淸晨，有醉酒靑年，在XX　路轉角處失足跌交，頭部觸路側磚塊受傷，當由警察扶起，該靑年旋自雇車返家療治。聞警士曾於該靑年身邊之身份證上發現，該靑年實係某要人之子，其父母向極溺愛，聽其縱情麵藥，遂致遵此意外云。」</p>

<h3>US House Foreign Affairs Committee Report Urges Emergency Aid to Europe and Asia; Announces Existing Soviet Armed Forces Numbers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The US House Foreign Affairs Committee submitted a report to the House today, strongly urging emergency aid of $590 million to Europe and China, and immediate action to prevent the spread of communism. It stated: Currently, the Soviet Union has 4,050,000 armed personnel, according to the Department of the Army's investigation. The report stated that the Soviet Union clearly has a clear and definite policy, attempting to prevent American aid to Europe and Asia, and to make it ineffective as much as possible. It also stated: When assisting other countries, we must also strengthen our own country, so that we can unite with all freedom-loving countries to prevent any unforeseen events.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The US House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a report stating: The Soviet Union is attempting to undermine American aid to Europe and Asia, and trying its best to make it expensive, so that the United States suffers economic losses. The committee also released figures from the Department of the Army, stating that the Soviet Union and its satellite countries currently have 5,213,000 armed personnel, while freedom-loving countries in Europe can immediately muster only 3,416,000, a ratio of approximately five to three. The report strongly urged the swift passage of the $590 million in emergency foreign aid, including $60 million in temporary aid to China, and believed that the work of aiding Europe has a good chance of success, and that the gradual abandonment of communism by Europeans is becoming increasingly obvious, as evidenced by the exclusion of the communist parties of France and Italy from the cabinet. The House decided to discuss the emergency foreign aid bill on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eaton, read a report to the House Rules Committee today, strongly urging the accelerated passage of the emergency foreign aid bill, which will be submitted to the House for discussion on Thursday. Eaton said: The Soviet Union could occupy all of Europe within 24 hours, but currently does not want a real war to break out immediately. If the Soviet Union occupied France and Italy through the hands of the French and Italian communist parties, it could then occupy Greece and Turkey.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Diplomacy; American Congressional and Public Attention Now Focused on Europe; Aid to China and the Japanese Peace Treaty Issues Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on diplomacy at a gathering on the 3rd, stating: The situation in Europe is gradually tightening, labor strikes are surging in various countries, and the Italian Communist Party will also take action. American congressional and public attention is focused on Europe, so aid to China and the Japanese peace treaty issues are greatly affected. The Ministry has not yet received the replies from the US and UK regarding the Japanese peace treaty, and we are studying the Soviet reply. Regarding the issue of Romania, Wang stated: Since the coup in that country, our side has maintained an attitude of observation and is awaiting detailed and accurate reports. Whether to recognize its new government has not been decided, and the same is true for the US and UK. As for the Romanian Ambassador to China, Dulesla, who was recently dismissed by the government, we do not deny Dulesla's legitimate status before we recognize their new government.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Implements Internal and External Rotation System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, stated at a press conference on the 3rd that the Ministry is gradually implementing an internal and external rotation system. He cited the example of the Acting Director of the Intelligence Department, who was also present today, saying that the Director of the Era Department was originally the Consul-General in South Africa, and was transferred back to the Ministry to serve as Acting Director of the Intelligence Department, as the original Director, Zhang Yuanzhang, had fallen ill and was temporarily unable to return to the country. Ye Gongchao analyzed the obstacles to the Ministry's implementation of the internal and external rotation system, saying that there are currently three major difficulties preventing the full implementation of the internal and external rotation system: 1. Our country lacks means of transportation, making travel difficult for transferred personnel; 2. The Ministry's funds are limited and unwilling to spend too much foreign exchange; 3. Talent is lacking. He also explained the last point, saying that the Ministry still pays attention to the recruitment of talent.</p>
<h3>Shen Shihua Internally Appointed as Our Minister to Austria</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Shen Shihua, our diplomatic representative to Austria, has been internally appointed as our Minister to Austria. Shen has already traveled from Switzerland to Vienna, and the National Government's appointment will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters in Japan Agreed to Our Sending Military Police to Japan Long Ago; Sending an Occupation Army is Temporarily Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Office of the Delegation to Japan: "The Allied Headquarters has already agreed in principle to our country sending military police to Japan, but the number is still under negotiation. The head of the trade mission believes that the number should not be too small, and should be a complete team. The logistics and accommodation of the military police after they go to Japan will be handled by our country." When asked by reporters whether the dispatch of military police might be followed by the dispatch of an occupation army, he replied: "This matter cannot be realized at present, because firstly, there are difficulties in foreign exchange. The consumption of a division of people abroad is quite considerable. Secondly, there is currently a major housing problem in Japan. The American troops in Japan are currently building extensively. If our country sends a division of people there, then barracks and warehouses will all become problems, so the matter of sending an occupation army to Japan cannot become a reality in the short term."</p>
<h3>MacArthur Continues to Approve Batch of Japanese Reparation Machinery and Equipment</h3>
<p>Allocating to China, UK, and Four Other Countries in Advance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] According to an official announcement this morning: MacArthur has recently approved the advance allocation of other reparation machinery and equipment to China, the UK, the Philippines, and the Netherlands, in addition to the 19,000 pieces of advanced reparation machinery and equipment that have already been designated for allocation. The new reparation equipment allocated to the four demanding countries is largely the same as the reparation equipment transferred from the arsenals, including all movable machinery, except for military equipment specifically designated to meet occupation needs, and certain other equipment permitted to be retained by Japan in accordance with the policies of the Far Eastern Commission. The official statement did not specify the amount of newly allocated reparations materials, but stated that it would not exceed 30% of the equipment of Japan's 90 army and navy arsenals.</p>
<h3>Sino-Hong Kong Agreement Still Needs to be Revised; Ye Gongchao Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, was tight-lipped about the agreement between China and Hong Kong and the Lushun-Dalian issue at a press conference on the afternoon of the 3rd, especially about the Lushun-Dalian issue. A reporter asked: On what date was the Sino-Hong Kong agreement signed? Can it be made public? What is its content? Ye said: There are two agreements between China and Hong Kong, one is a continued discussion of trade; I have proposed a plan for the customs agreement.</p>
<p>Canton Customs Seizes Private Goods Worth Hundreds of Billions in Eleven Months; Soong Tzu-wen Emphasizes Increasing Import Quotas</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd] According to the person in charge of customs: From January to November of this year, private goods worth over 100 billion yuan have been seized. The amount is so large that the total tax revenue for the year is also behind it. The prevalence of smuggling is truly alarming. Soong Tzu-wen reported in the Provincial Assembly that although the Central Government has signed an anti-smuggling agreement with Hong Kong, and the customs and shipping have strengthened inspections, it will be difficult to prevent smuggling if the province's required raw materials cannot obtain a reasonable amount of imports. If the province's request for 18% of the import quota is approved by the Central Government, then smuggling can be prevented immediately.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In order to assist the government in controlling the export ban on rice, the Canton Customs has strengthened inspections. On the 2nd, it seized several loads of white rice smuggled for export on various ships, and all of it was confiscated. Since Hong Kong has not yet proposed a counter-proposal, neither has been signed. Regarding the Lushun-Dalian issue, a reporter asked whether there had been any other contact besides the note we sent to the Soviet Union last month. Ye replied: Our note was purely to declare our position, and there has been no other contact. Apart from this, Ye did not answer any of the reporter's questions related to the Lushun-Dalian issue.</p>
<h3>North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters to be Established Within a Week; Rumor that Fu Zuoyi will Resign as Chairman of Chahar Province</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Related authorities said: The Ministry of National Defense issued an order yesterday, limiting the establishment of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters to within one week. It will operate in Peiping in the short term, and will be moved to Fengtai after the merger of the Zhangjiakou and Baoding Pacification Headquarters is completed. The Commander-in-Chief will have two or three Deputy Commanders-in-Chief, stationed in various important towns in Chahar and Suiyuan. The candidates will be selected from Chen Jicheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Song Kentang, and Deng Baoshan. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi will resign from his position as Chairman of Chahar Province to concentrate on military command. The new chairmen of Rehe and Chahar provinces may be announced at the same time. The highest authorities have asked Fu Zuoyi to consider suitable candidates. Although the National Government has clearly ordered that the jurisdiction of this headquarters be Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, in reality, Shanxi Province will only include Yanbei, and the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters will remain as it is. The rumor that a Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region Headquarters will be established is not accurate. Moreover, after the establishment of the headquarters, the names of the pacification zones within its jurisdiction (such as Western Rehe) will be cancelled, and three or four army corps will be formed under the headquarters to control the various armies. Although the headquarters' organization has not yet arrived, it will generally be the same as the pacification headquarters. In principle, the Peiping Executive Headquarters will still be in a supervisory position, and Sun Lianzhong will only be responsible for the administrative duties of Hebei Province. When reporters asked about the development of the situation in North China and the issue of troop strength after the establishment of the headquarters, a qualified person said: The development will be at the beginning of next year, and the existing troop strength is sufficient, because the past failures were due to the failure to mobilize troop strength between various regions. When reporters asked whether the bandits in Jinxi and northern Jinbei would form another target for bandit intrusion if the troop strength in Chahar and Suiyuan were transferred elsewhere in the future, he said: There is no need to worry. Fu Zuoyi has already trained a powerful reserve army in Chahar and Suiyuan, and the Central Government has provided them with excellent equipment. Regarding the future coordination of military and government affairs, he said that Fu Zuoyi is working on formulating a concrete plan to correct the disconnected phenomena of the past.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The newly appointed Commander of Bandit Suppression in Yanbei, Yu Zhenhe, took a car to Datong this morning to take office.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Fu Zuoyi continued to contact various parties today, and his headquarters' preparatory office will start operating at the International Friendship Association tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military News: According to reports, the communist bandits are discussing countermeasures against the newly established bandit suppression organization in North China.

<h3>Communist Bandit's Old Nest in Northern Jiangsu, Hede Town, Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Hede Town, located south of the Sheyang River in the northeast of Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, which was occupied by communist bandits for twelve years and known as the communist bandits' old coastal nest in Northern Jiangsu, has now been captured by the troops of the Huaihai Pacification Zone. The agricultural oil mill established there by the communist bandits, along with tens of thousands of books, were all seized by the National Army. It was also learned from the confessions of prisoners that this place was actually the political and economic center and supply base of the communist bandits in Northern Jiangsu at this stage. The remaining communist bandit units, the 11th and 12th columns in Northern Jiangsu, have suffered a serious blow and will feel increasingly impoverished in the future. The troops of the Huaihai Pacification Zone began to advance east from the south bank of the Liutang River east of Hanshui in the middle of last month, passed through the old Yellow River in Yancheng, broke through the strong resistance of the 11th and 12th columns of communist bandits, and finally reached the south bank of the Sheyang River at the end of last month and captured the Hede Town area.</p>

<h3>Deng Wenyi Reports on the War Situation for a Week; Bandit Army in a Passive Position is on the Road to Collapse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the war situation for the week of November 26 to December 2 at a press conference on the afternoon of the 3rd, stating:</p>
<p>North China</p>
<p>This week, the war situation in North China was generally relatively peaceful. Due to the appointment of General Fu Zuoyi as the Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the merger of the Zhangjiakou and Baoding Pacification Headquarters, the unified command of the front-line operations in North China, and the enhanced lineup of bandit suppression in North China, the war situation in that area will definitely have new developments in the future. In the northern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, except for the fact that the bandit army continued to attack Yuanshi day and night after the 27th of this month, and once approached the city walls several times. After the defending army counterattacked with bloodshed and the air force assisted in repeated bombing and strafing, the bandit army suffered heavy casualties. Only bandit troops were found in the vicinity of Baoding, wandering and guerrilla in areas ranging from a dozen to forty or fifty li from the city, and there was no major contact between the two sides.</p>
<p>Northeast</p>
<p>In the Northeast, after the failure of the sixth offensive by the bandit army, their manpower and material resources suffered very significant losses in all aspects. Judging from the wounded soldiers alone, it is estimated that there were more than 40,000 wounded and sick soldiers gathered south of Jilin in Shulinzi on November 24 and 25, waiting to be transported. Recently, Haicheng and Dashiqiao were recaptured, the railway between Panyang and Yingkou was once again under the control of the National Army, and the weather was cold, the bandit army lacked winter combat equipment, so the bandit troops on both sides of the China Changchun Railway retreated to the mountainous areas of Liaoyuan Shuangshan and Xi'an Xifeng, searching for food and clothing, and forcibly conscripting militia to reorganize and replenish; however, in mid-November, the 29th Division of the 10th Column of the bandit army in northern Jilin defected entirely in the area north of Jiutai, and fled in disarray. This is the most obvious example of the low morale and wavering military spirit of the bandit army in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Northern Shaanxi</p>
<p>In Northern Shaanxi, the victory of the National Army in the Battle of Yulin, on the one hand, demonstrated the loyalty, bravery, and good fighting skills of the Northwest Cavalry under General Ma Hongkui's command. In this battle, the communist bandits suffered repeated blows, initially encountering resistance in Yulin, and then suffering setbacks in Shahe, resulting in losses of more than 20,000 people, creating a brilliant victory for the National Army in the Northwest, and stabilizing the overall war situation in the Northwest. The remaining bandits transferred their forces and attacked Sanbian. Because Anbian only had a company of defending troops, it was captured. Ma's reinforcements will arrive soon and it will not be difficult to recapture.</p>
<p>Shaanxi-Henan Border</p>
<p>The Kong Congzhou bandits on the Henan-Shaanxi border have been wandering around Shangnan, Hanchuanguan, Shaanxi, and Zhen'an this week. Initially, they were intercepted everywhere by our local militia, and were exhausted from running around. They were then fatally attacked by the National Army, and have been cut into two sections. Apart from a part that fled back to the Tai Shan Temple and Checun areas northeast of the Funiu Mountains, a part is still perishing in Shaanxi, Zhen'an, and Xixiang. The National Army is searching and suppressing them separately. The Chen Zhong's Fourth Column in Western Henan has been so badly damaged by our militia in Neixiang and Zhenping that they have lost more than half of their strength, and had to flee to the mountain Tai Shan Temple, Checun area in the north of Neixiang. The 9th Column is in the Fangcheng and Tanghe area, and another part of the 26th Brigade of the 9th Column has been isolated by the National Army and the militia, and is still wandering in the Song County and Chi Zhen area. There is also a part stationed near Yu City, the 22nd Brigade, and the 31st Brigade; the remaining bandits who fled back from Kong Congzhou fled east again after the National Army occupied Yu City. Now it is raining and snowing everywhere in Henan, and the weather is cold and freezing. The bandit army lacks food and clothing, and has no new actions other than trying to loot as much as possible.</p>
<p>Dabie Mountains Area</p>
<p>The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops on the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains have been wandering around Susong, Guangji, Huangmei, Xishui, and Macheng this week, attempting to use the cover of the lake and pond area in eastern Hubei to avoid strength and preserve their forces, and also to prepare for a plan to secretly cross the Yangtze River. Due to the overwhelming pressure of our superior army, they could not stand on the riverside, and fled north one after another. After the National Army entered and occupied Taihu, Yingshan, and Luotian, most of the bandits were defeated and gathered in the area south of Fubei, northeast, and Guangshan and Luoshan, echoing Chen Yi in the north, with the possibility of preparing to fight a decisive battle with the National Army in the Dabie Mountain area.</p>
<p>Western Shandong and Northern Anhui</p>
<p>In addition, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit army, which fled south from Taihe and Mengyang, have mostly crossed the Shahe River and gathered in the southeast of Shenqiu, seemingly attempting to support Liu Bocheng in Xincai and Hanchuan, to preserve the foothills of the Dabie Mountains, and to save the critical situation after the National Army occupied Lihuang and Taihu. If necessary, they can also provide a reception for Liu's bandit army to flee north, but since Jinxiang was relieved on November 26, the 10th, 11th, and 8th Columns of the bandit army retreated to the west of Shan County, Cao County, and Chengwu. Looking at the entire situation of the bandit army east of the Peiping-Hankou Railway and south of the Yellow River, the bandit army is completely in a passive position. Severe winter is approaching, they have lost their strongholds, are attacked by militia, and have difficulty in supplying. They are gradually losing the three conditions of timing, location, and harmony, and are on the road to collapse day by day.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the Housing Rental Ordinance</h3>
<p>Since the victory in the War of Resistance, housing rental disputes have remained unresolved. To reasonably address the housing shortage, eliminate the existing malpractices in housing rental methods, and protect the vested property rights of homeowners, the Legislative Yuan, after repeated careful discussions and soliciting opinions from local public opinion organs and experts, passed the "Housing Rental Ordinance," which was officially promulgated and implemented by the National Government on the first day [of the month]. When the Legislative Yuan carefully deliberated the ordinance, public opinion in various places called for the early promulgation of reasonable rental regulations. The Fourth Plenary Session of the China Law Society further suggested that the government promptly formulate rental ordinances to facilitate the handling of housing disputes. The Legislative Yuan adopted public opinion, resulting in the passage of the Housing Rental Ordinance. After carefully reading the content of the ordinance, we deeply feel that the legislative spirit is impartial and unbiased, neither rigidly adhering to the facts nor focusing solely on theory. The original legislative intention seems to be to protect tenants (renters), support landlords (property owners), and crack down on subletting (sub-landlords), so that the due interests of all three parties can be taken into account. This legislative spirit is fair and reasonable, and we believe it should be elaborated upon:</p>
<p>First, the purpose of formulating this ordinance seems to be to regulate the supply and demand of housing. "For houses that can be lived in, but are currently not for self-use or rent, the government may order them to be rented out within a limited period of one month. For houses for self-use that exceed actual needs, according to the provisions of Article 96 of the Land Law, the government may order the excess houses to be rented out within a limited period." The main purpose of its second article is to restrict the possession of houses as private property; all houses should serve the public to regulate supply and demand and solve the housing shortage. The so-called "actual needs" are difficult to have a clear standard, which can easily lead to disturbances. With the protection of the people's interests as the premise, it seems that the provincial and municipal governments should provide reasonable remedies when formulating supplementary measures.</p>
<p>Second, to determine the rental deposit system. Rent is the legal income of the landlord. "When a house is rented, a deposit may be collected in addition to the rent. The maximum amount of the deposit shall not exceed the total amount of two months' rent." Article 3 stipulates that rent shall be "paid monthly" in principle, and the "maximum amount" of rent "may be restricted by the government in charge with the consent of the public opinion organ, according to the local economic situation." It also stipulates that "the lessor (landlord) shall not collect tips or any other fees in any name other than the rent deposit." Violators will be fined according to law. The main purpose is to determine the amount and payment of rent, the ratio and amount of the deposit; and to determine the housing rental relationship, except for the rent deposit as the legal rights and interests of the landlord, no extra extortion or unreasonable demands shall be made. This has protective significance for both lessors and lessees.</p>
<p>Third, to restrict the subletting of houses. Subletting is a bad system. The so-called "sub-landlord" is produced by subletting; the fees charged for subletting, that is, the so-called "transfer fee," are also unreasonable and illegal malpractices. This ordinance adopts a restrictive approach to subletting, stipulating that "the lessee shall not sublet the entire house to others. If a part of the house is sublet, if the contract has an opposing stipulation, the lessor shall first give written consent, or the sublet contract shall be sent to the lessor for signature. The sublet rent shall be calculated according to the ratio of the sublet part of the house to the original rent, and shall not exceed one time the original rent. If there is an original deposit, the calculation of the deposit shall be the same, and half of the part of the rent deposit exceeding the original amount shall be paid to the lessor. No transfer fee, tips or any other fees in any name shall be collected for subletting the house." The main purpose of this at least contains three key points: The house shall not be sublet in its entirety. If the original contract between the lessee and the lessor allows it, only part of it can be sublet, but the lessor has the right to agree. This is to prevent the free transfer of the house; There are certain restrictions on sublet rent and deposit, and the lessor can enjoy the income from subletting. This is to eliminate the intermediate exploitation of subletting; Abolish transfer fees, tips or other disguised extortion. Therefore, it can be said that this ordinance is a special law to strictly crack down on transfer and protect the property rights of landlords.</p>
<p>Fourth, to protect the stability of the tenant's residence. The tenant rents a house from the landlord according to law, which is the tenant's right to reside and shall not be interfered with unless otherwise provided by law. Therefore, this article is to protect the rights and interests of tenants; to avoid extortion by landlords, it stipulates that the lessor shall not terminate the contractual relationship unless one of the following circumstances exists: The lessee uses the house for purposes that violate laws and regulations; The lessee owes more than two months' rent in addition to offsetting the deposit; Intentionally or negligently damages the house without repairing it or providing considerable compensation; Sublets the house to others without the lessor's consent; The lessor submits conclusive proof of recovering the house for self-use upon expiration of the contract; The agreed lease term has expired; The lessee closes the house and does not use it for six months; The house must be rebuilt. However, "if the house is still rented out after reconstruction, the original tenant has the priority to rent it." In addition, "if the house is recovered for self-use; if it is left idle for more than three months, or is rented to others within one year, the original tenant has the right to request continued rent and may request compensation for damages." If the lessor "forces the lessee to move out without reason during the continuation of the lease relationship, the lessee may ask the judicial organ to provide effective protection." The main purpose of these regulations is to protect the tenant's right to residence. The legislation is comprehensive, taking into account human relations, and at the same time restricting the lessor from using high pressure against the tenant or changing the lease relationship without following the law.</p>
<p>In addition to this, this ordinance has two major characteristics: one is that in the areas where this ordinance is implemented, the regulations stipulate that "agencies that provide dormitories for their staff shall not collect rent. Those who do not provide dormitories shall be given a considerable amount of subsidy." This has special preferential meaning for personnel serving in public affairs agencies. Secondly, in order to seek urban social welfare, this ordinance also stipulates that people should be encouraged to build houses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "Housing Rental Ordinance" is two progressive social legislations. The realization of this progressive and social nature depends on the effective implementation of the law. First of all, local governments must enforce it effectively, without favoritism or personal feelings, so that it can become popular; secondly, people of all classes must abide by the law and obey all the provisions of the law. If the people do not abide by the law, even if the government and the courts enforce the law strictly, the progressiveness and social nature of the law will disappear. Therefore, we believe that in order to reasonably solve the housing shortage and balance the rental relationship, the government should implement this ordinance well, so that the current bad atmosphere can be reversed. After the wedding of the British princess, the royal army carrying the princess and her newlywed husband, covered with flowers, departed from Buckingham Palace to Waterloo Station, and then took a train to Winchester for their honeymoon.

<h3>Director Dong and Deputy Minister Ye Answer Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Director Dong Xian Guang and Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gong Chao answered questions at the press conference of the Executive Yuan News Bureau on the 3rd as follows:</p>
<p>Director Dong's answer: There is nothing particularly surprising about the rumor that the Communist Party plans to establish a Far East International News Agency. The issue of improving the treatment of public officials is being studied by the competent government authorities, and a practical solution will be found soon. According to the information provided by the Ministry of Justice, as of June 36, the total number of corruption cases concluded by courts across the country in the past two and a half years was 16,794. 17,454 civil servants were involved, of which 6,385 have been sentenced, including 1 executed, 32 sentenced to life imprisonment, 671 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years, 2,554 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 5 years but less than 10 years, and 3,127 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 1 year but less than 5 years. There are still some cases that have not been concluded, and the defendants include Chu Xin, the former mayor of Nanchang, Zhou Yanming, the former director of the Pearl River Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Lu Shouren, the former director of the Yunnan Civil Affairs Department, Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai branch of the bureau, Hu Mai, the former director of the Hunan Tianliang Office, Wang Xidiao, the former director of the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau, Qiu Ruiquan, the former member of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, Zhang Legu, the former national senator, Wang Rangqian, the former president of the Jinan Provincial Hospital, and others. After the establishment of the Financial Administration, the bureau will exercise unified authority in cracking down on illegal speculation in the financial control market. The government is determined to prevent speculation and stabilize prices, hence the establishment of the bureau. In recent days, the price stability phenomenon has already occurred in the Shanghai market, and the government will also strengthen the management of cotton yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Deputy Foreign Minister Ye's answer: The Chinese government is currently studying the Soviet Union's reply to China's proposals regarding the peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is still closely watching the development of the internal affairs of Siam. The Chinese government has not withdrawn its recognition of the Siamese ambassador to China.</p>
<p>Since the US China Act is still under discussion in the US Congress, I do not intend to comment on it at this time.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Arrives in Shanghai, Reports to Nanjing Tonight</h3>

Mr. Jiang told a Central News Agency reporter that the Philippine government prepared very carefully for this Far East Economic Conference. President Roxas also opened his private villa as a reception center, doing his best as the host. The meeting schedule was extended due to the request of various Far Eastern countries to participate, and the issues discussed at the meeting were more complicated than at the previous meeting and involved political issues. Although the chairman repeatedly explained to the members that this meeting was purely to discuss Far Eastern economic issues, issues involving politics were constantly raised, especially the recent request of Indonesia to join the General Assembly, which caused fierce debate. Mr. Jiang himself was anxious to return to the country to report, so he left the Philippines before the meeting ended. The conference may end on the 6th of this month. Mr. Jiang has scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight to report.</p>
<h3>Far East Economic Conference Subcommittee Meeting, US Proposes Self-Reliance Plan</h3>

<h3>### US, Britain, and France Advocate a Peace Conference with Germany, China Should Be Listed as a Convening Nation, Soviet Representative Still Firmly Opposed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] At today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Western nations and the Soviet Union were divided over the issue of China's participation in a future German peace conference. Marshall stated that it was agreed in the Potsdam Conference that the Foreign Ministers' Conference dealing with German issues should include the five powers, including China, and he deeply hoped to abide by the stipulations of the Potsdam Conference. Molotov, however, opposed Marshall's interpretation, arguing that China could only be a convening nation for the Japanese peace conference, as China did not sign the German surrender document, and the Potsdam Agreement only referred to member nations of the Foreign Ministers' Conference that signed the surrender document. The foreign ministers of Britain and France both expressed their support for China as a convening nation for the German peace conference. As a result, this point failed to reach an agreement. The discussion of the China issue arose when the Western nations and the Soviet Union clashed over the following two questions: Which of the smaller allied nations should participate in the committee drafting the German peace treaty; Which nations should participate in the information and advisory conference. Although the four powers acknowledged that among the nations that declared war on Germany, the order of declarations, the severity of war losses, and their relationship to the peace treaty were not all the same, they still could not agree on which nations should be listed in which category.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The four foreign ministers held their seventh meeting today. Britain and the US strongly advocated that smaller allied nations have the right to participate in the four main committees drafting the German peace treaty. Marshall even cited Canada as an example. The Foreign Ministers' Conference still has four points to be decided today: The organization of the main committees of the German peace conference; Whether China should participate in the conference; Which nations should compose the subcommittee; The information committee of the peace conference. Molotov originally suggested that the four main committees of the peace conference should only be attended by the four powers. Later, upon the suggestion of M. Mieuville, representative of French Foreign Minister Bidault, that the four powers invite representatives of smaller allied nations to participate, Molotov abandoned his original suggestion and accepted the French proposal. However, Britain believed that these four main committees should be composed of the four powers together with the previously listed nineteen nations, including Pakistan, while the United States advocated that they should be composed of the four powers together with an appropriate number of other nations. As a result, the opinions of the British-American side and the Soviet-French side could not be reconciled, and no agreement was reached. The Foreign Ministers' Conference then discussed the China issue, but without result. Then they discussed the organization of the information committee. Britain and France advocated that it should be composed of the five powers together with the nineteen allied nations and some other unspecified nations, while the Soviet Union insisted that it could only be composed of the five powers and the other nineteen nations, and agreed to the British-French suggestion that other belligerent nations could provide opinions, but not participate. Marshall, however, advocated that all members of the United Nations that had declared war on Germany should have the right to participate in the information conference.</p>
<h3>### Four Foreign Ministers Begin to Address the Austrian Peace Treaty Issue, Representatives' Meeting Submits Report for Review</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] The four foreign ministers are preparing to address the Austrian peace treaty issue today. Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall this morning. Prime Minister Attlee hosted a banquet for the four foreign ministers at Number 10 Downing Street.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The report of the four powers' representatives reviewing the French compromise proposal on the issue of German assets in Austria was submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 2nd and was decided by the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be reviewed on the 3rd. The report recorded the Soviet Union's opposition to the French compromise proposal and the general acceptance of it by the British and American representatives.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference is nearing its end today on the matter of drafting the German peace treaty, but no progress has been made on major issues. The Austrian peace treaty issue will be addressed next. Some American representatives believe that the current conference only proves two points: that the Soviet Union and the Western nations cannot find a compromise basis regarding the future of Germany for the time being, and that Molotov is determined to use the conference as a venue for delivering political speeches to the German people. Mr. Molotov has undoubtedly been very successful in this regard.</p>
<h3>### Four Foreign Ministers Invited to Attend Royal Tea Party</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Official sources announced today after the adjournment of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference that King George has invited US Secretary of State Marshall and the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to a tea party at Buckingham Palace tomorrow evening.</p>

<h3>### France and Italy's Economies Are Exhausted and Urgently Awaiting American Loans, All Hope the US House of Representatives Will Quickly Pass</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] State Department officials confirmed today that unless the House of Representatives quickly passes the emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria that has already been passed by the Senate, supplies to these countries will soon be interrupted. Within this week, without the allocation of emergency funds, important factories in France will be forced to shut down at the beginning of next year. France originally planned to use its remaining US$100 million in US currency this month to pay for chemicals, basic materials, and industrial raw materials, but now it may have to change to paying for urgently needed coal and grain. The US Commodity Loan Bank has already purchased 150,000 tons of grain on behalf of Italy, but with Italy's US dollars exhausted, this grain will not be able to be shipped without emergency aid funds.</p>
<h3>### Republicans Accuse Truman of Misusing Export Control Authority</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US House International Commerce Committee approved a resolution on the 2nd requesting the Department of Commerce to prepare for Congress a complete list of all important goods and materials exported during the year. The committee approved this resolution at an indefinite meeting. Based on legislation, the committee, using the resolution advocated by Congressman Mett, requested a list limited to exports to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. Previously, Republican leaders were considering approving legislation to force President Truman to tighten export controls as a measure to prevent currency inflation. Hurlock stated that the Republican Comprehensive Committee had discussed setting up appropriate management to cancel some of the president's management authority regarding export controls, but no resolution was reached. Republicans have criticized Truman for failing to effectively use his export control law, which will expire on January 29.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] According to UN Secretary-General Lie, the Korean Committee is scheduled to go to Korea in the first week of January to supervise the Korean general election, establish an independent and unified Korean government, and withdraw the US forces. UN Assistant Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse has been appointed as the secretary of the committee. The committee is composed of nine countries: China, Australia, Canada, France, India, the Philippines, El Salvador, Syria, and Ukraine, and Ukraine has announced that it is unwilling to participate.</p>
<p>Observers familiar with the situation believe that the United States hopes that the committee will be able to smoothly establish a semi-independent government in South Korea, and that it will be able to become the government of the entire Korea in time when the Soviet Union withdraws. At the same time, it is learned that US officials are estimating that economic aid will be used as a weapon to promote Korean unification. It is said that their theory is that if an independent government is established in South Korea and North Korea refuses to participate, this matter may obtain economic aid from Congress, which is sufficient to raise the economic level of South Korea and induce North Korea's envy and join the South Korean government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 2nd] Chang Daesu (transliteration), the behind-the-scenes leader of the Korean right-wing Democratic Party, was assassinated at his home at 7 p.m. on the 2nd. The three murderers have not been arrested. Mr. Chang was formerly a supporter of Syngman Rhee, but recently led a movement supporting the visit of the UN Committee to Korea, opposing Syngman Rhee's request to hold general elections immediately in South Korea to organize an independent government.</p>

<h3>Public Appearance of Jewish Underground Army Worsens Situation in Holy Land, Concerns Rise in Britain and the US Over Potential Soviet Intervention</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 2nd] It has been announced that the Jewish self-defense force, Haganah, has mobilized 10,000 Jewish men and women in Palestine to assist British police in preparing to deal with Arab attacks.

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 2nd] British representative to the United Nations, Cadogan, discussed the matter of a United Nations commission visiting Palestine with UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie today. According to reliable sources, American military figures are extremely concerned about the political problems that the conflicts in the Holy Land will cause. They believe that if the situation continues to deteriorate, the Soviet Union may insist on sending troops to the Holy Land to support the UN resolution, which would create a major problem for the US government. Britain has already warned the US that Soviet troops in Palestine would have significant political implications. It is also understood that the United Nations commission may not be formed for another two to three weeks. The Secretary-General of the commission may be appointed from the Director of the UN Trusteeship Department, Ben Choux. UN Secretariat staff do not seem interested in being transferred to the commission.</p>

<h3>Conveying the Culture of Border Nationalities Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Arrives in Shanghai Tides of Welcoming Crowds Hu Die and Ye Meng Present Flowers Stars Joyfully Shake Hands</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Visiting Troupe, including Kangbarhan, Pufeng, Minawa, Shuyida, Tursunhan, Nazhiye, and others, totaling fifty-three people, led by Deputy Head Yifu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday via the Qiantang PC603 train from Beijing. Representatives from various circles, including Xie Renjian, Yu Wen, Tan Yimin, Liu Ming, representatives from the Xinjiang Shanghai Association, including Yitongkan, Duoshan, Abudoukelimu, Mamuti, representatives from the Shanghai branch of the Islamic Association, including Haibin, Hiali, representatives from the Fudan Islamic Students Association, Fan Ruyu, Yu Zhiping, and more than ten representatives from the Seamen's Party Department, the Central Training Corps Shanghai branch, the Fine Arts Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, and the Chinese Academy of Music and Dance, all went to the station to welcome them, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>At two forty-five, when the train entered the station, the audience rushed into the station, vying to catch a glimpse of the brilliance of the border stars. Their excitement was so overwhelming that order was disrupted, and the platform was packed with people. The song and dance troupe was unable to get off the train for a long time. At that moment, movie star Hu Die arrived at the station and was immediately surrounded by the crowd. All planned ceremonies could not be carried out. The Northwest Film Company originally planned to shoot a documentary, but the recording and photography equipment was pushed around by the crowd and could not be used.</p>
<p>Amidst the noise, Dai Ailian's nine-year-old daughter, Ye Meng, squeezed into the carriage, presented flowers to Kangbarhan, and attached a short letter from Su to the troupe, expressing the welcome of the city's song and dance community. Kang then pinned a carnation in Ye Meng's hair, and they smiled at each other with their arms around each other's necks, their hearts connected. Subsequently, the troupe broke through the crowd to the sound of military music, and went to the Youth Center on Huashan Road to rest. After arriving, Hu Die re-performed the flower presentation ceremony, and Kang accepted with a smile. The two members met in the same hall and shook hands warmly, creating a very pleasant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Kangbarhan, the flower of the Uyghur people, attracted the most attention from the crowd yesterday. Kang wore a "Toba" felt hat, with her braids hanging low, thick eyebrows and piercing eyes, red flowers in her temples, and large gold ornaments inlaid on her wrists and ears. She was robust, simple, agile, and graceful, and her profound artistic cultivation was evident in her humble and sincere demeanor. The other members of the troupe were also healthy and beautiful. Yesterday, Kangbarhan's young daughter and Director Aisha's young son came to Shanghai on the same train. They could already speak Mandarin and were very excited about the frenzied welcome.</p>
<p>To Perform More Than Forty Types of Dance Programs</p>
<p>According to Mr. He Guangli, the Xinjiang Provincial Government Councilor who accompanied the visiting troupe, he told reporters, "The purpose of this song and dance troupe's visit is to express the culture of the border ethnic groups and to observe the arts of the mainland. It is not for profit. The current plan is to stay in Shanghai for a month. If time permits, they may go to other parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The song and dance troupe has prepared forty dance programs, some of which have been performed in Beijing, but the rest have not been performed in the mainland and may refresh the audience."</p>
<p>[Another report] Yesterday, when the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Visiting Troupe arrived at the Youth Center on Huashan Road by train from the North Station, reporters from various newspapers competed to capture this precious moment when Hu Die presented flowers to Kangbarhan. However, He Feiguang, director of Northwest Film Company, blocked the camera with his body and said sternly, "What are you filming?" Later, when reporters from various newspapers went upstairs to interview, they were also firmly rejected by the reception staff, which aroused the indignation of all the reporters. The order was chaotic yesterday, and the audience and reporters were squeezed beyond recognition. It is hoped that the reception staff will pay attention to improvements in the future, and carefully arrange in advance to avoid being unable to maintain order.</p>

<h3>Postage Adjustment Order Has Not Yet Been Received in This City</h3>

<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue Three Hours of Heated Debate Labor and Management Representatives Express Their Hardships Research Committee to Re-discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Research Committee invited representatives from the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union to hold a symposium at the Social Bureau's conference room at 3 pm yesterday to seek opinions. Chairman Lu Jingshi elaborated on the significance and process of establishing the Year-End Bonus Research Committee and reported on last year's year-end bonus method, and then invited representatives from all attendees to express their opinions. Wang Xianqing, a representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, first stated that the year-end bonus method set by the government last year was very fair and was successfully implemented. He hoped that the government would use this policy to achieve a satisfactory result for this year's year-end bonus. Shui Xiangyunyan, representing the labor sector, spoke, hoping for two points: The minimum year-end bonus for this year should not be less than one month, but it should be scaled according to the prosperity and decline of various industries. Temporary workers and piece-rate workers should also receive year-end bonuses. Jin Runxiang of the Chamber of Commerce hoped that there would be no rigid regulations for universal rewards. Xia Enlin of Fangjian Company said: This year, all yarn factories have not made money, and it is hoped that the year-end bonus can be lower than last year. Moreover, the total number of year-end bonuses for all industries in the city is huge, and the year-end credit is tight. It is imperative for the National Bank to issue more large notes to cope with it. The consequences are worth considering. Pan Shihao of the City Chamber of Commerce stated that this year's industry and commerce is extremely difficult and it is feared that they cannot afford the year-end bonus. Zhang Zhusan of the General Labor Union believes that workers are living in hardship. The living index for November is 53,100 times, which needs to be calculated with a discount, while the price index has reached more than 84,000 times. The year-end bonus is the hope of workers for the year. If it is not properly resolved, the problem will be serious. Zhou Xuexiang believes that the saying that year-end bonuses stimulate prices is not true. Capitalists have difficulties, and workers also have difficulties. It is hoped that this year's year-end bonus can be based on last year with one month as the principle. If there are difficulties, labor and management can openly discuss and negotiate. Xie Fukang of the Industrial Association said that in order to avoid situations such as last year's strikes, even if they can afford the year-end bonus, they also hope to issue it in a stable manner. Other speakers included Liang Yongzhang, Liu Qingyi, Liu Jingji, Li Kaidi, and others. After three hours of heated debate, Chairman Lu Jingshi summarized the opinions of all parties into three points: We must consider the actual situation and be realistic. During this period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the year-end bonus issue should be resolved reasonably and legally, and how to prevent the year-end bonus from stimulating prices. At the same time, in terms of public security, attention should be paid to preventing it from being used by the Communist Party or other unfortunate events from occurring. In addition, efforts should be made to resolve year-end bonus disputes quickly. If the Social Bureau cannot resolve it, it will be sent to the Evaluation Committee for processing. The difficulties of both labor and management are all facts. This responsibility cannot be borne by the government. We should recognize the goal and be entirely caused by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Lu Jingshi concluded by saying: The task of the Research Committee is to study methods and provide them for the government's reference when making decisions. After seeking opinions from all parties this time, the Research Committee will hold a meeting to discuss them. It is not convenient to announce it before the meeting is held or even if a method has been decided but has not been submitted to Mayor Wu for approval. However, Lu assured the representatives from the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce that he was responsible for drafting a method in a very short period of time and providing it to the government for a decision as soon as possible. The symposium did not end until after 6 pm.</p>

<h3>Coal Gas Consumption Reaches Peak Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Discusses Countermeasures Decides to Adopt the Principle of Average Distribution Electric Power for Schools Decided to be Given Preference</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters yesterday that the city's coal gas consumption has reached its peak. Due to the recent cold weather, the consumption of various users has increased. If this continues, the supply of coal gas may become a problem. Moreover, the city's gas plants have decided to carry out repairs simultaneously in the coming spring, which may slightly affect the coal gas supply. To this end, the Public Utilities Bureau specially invited relevant parties to discuss countermeasures yesterday, and resolved that all users applying for coal gas should strive for the principle of average distribution. From now on, the user's application form should be sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, and the bureau will implement average distribution based on its consumption.</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Utilities Bureau convened a power supply review committee at 3 pm yesterday, and the following resolutions were made on the application of various schools in the city to the Public Utilities Bureau for preferential electricity use: In the past, the applications of various schools in the city to increase the amount of electricity used were all in the name of the school principal, so the Public Utilities Bureau regarded them as ordinary private electricity use applications and did not approve them. In the future, schools applying should use the name of the school, and the Public Utilities Bureau can find a way as soon as possible. The standard for school electricity use is determined to be calculated at 80% of the highest amount in the three months of March, April, and May of this year to give preferential treatment. If schools still have difficulties, they can report them truthfully, and the Public Utilities Bureau will increase them appropriately according to actual needs.</p>

<p>The reasons for reducing the sentence are roughly as follows: Although Chen held important positions in the puppet government, the motive for his participation in the puppet Wang Jingwei regime stemmed from escorting Wang's children to Hong Kong for their studies, as evidenced by Mr. Chen's own letter. This differs from those who intentionally defected to the puppet regime. During his tenure in the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government, Chen achieved definite results in implementing anti-smoking and anti-drug measures. Evidence includes reports from the enemy regarding the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government's anti-smoking efforts, a signed report from the puppet Finance Department regarding the implementation of anti-drug and anti-smoking measures, Guangdong Provincial Government's anti-drug and anti-smoking document archives, and various books and newspapers documenting the "Situation of Eradicating Opium Seedlings in Guangdong." This point was significantly beneficial to the people's health. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was consulted regarding the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" and other humiliating treaties concluded by the puppet government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that the defendant's name was not found to be involved. The Guangdong High Court Prosecutor's Office and the two High Courts stated that the defendant had not engaged in any behavior unfavorable to the people in Guangdong. Based on the facts investigated above, while not entitling him to complete acquittal, when weighing the gravity of the crimes, it is not impossible to spare him from the death penalty. Therefore, within the legally prescribed punishment, the sentence is changed to life imprisonment. Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 1, Article 2, Section 1, Item 1, Article 8, Section 1, and Article 9 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, Article 2, Section 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 37, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, the verdict is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Land Prosecutor's Office Orders Review of Case Files for Lu Wenying's Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] During the occupation of Shanghai, female gang leader Lu Laoqi, named Lu Wenying, colluded with the enemy and puppet regimes, recruited many followers, and trafficked in drugs.

Ma denied colluding with the enemy and claimed to be an underground worker who had participated in the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps. Judge Liu questioned him, "If you are a member of the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps, why is it that the person who reported you is also a person in charge of the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps?" Ma was speechless.</p>
<h3>Barge Freight Rates Automatically Adjusted: Loading and Unloading Rates Increase by 10%; Decision Passed by Port Affairs Consolidation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Shanghai Port Affairs Consolidation Committee held its 42nd meeting yesterday in the City Government Conference Room. The resolutions are as follows: (A) The automatic adjustment method for barge freight rates is approved as follows: For boatmen's wages, the wages approved in July will be used as the base. Each time the freight rates are adjusted, they will be increased or decreased proportionally according to the cost of living index. Regarding the automatic adjustment calculation formula for barging fees, the boatmen's wage portion should be revised according to the first point of the resolution. In the future, freight rates may be adjusted once a month, but if the increase or decrease is less than 20 percent, no adjustment may be made. In the future, when adjusting freight rates according to this automatic adjustment calculation formula, the guild should first prepare a detailed report according to the formula and submit it to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval before implementation. (B) Regarding the request from the Municipal Wharf Commercial Guild to adjust labor prices, the following three resolutions were made: Loading and unloading rates will be increased by 50 percent. The payment of wages to workers at each wharf should be related to the R.S.D. (presumably, Rate Standardization Division), and the Wharf Industry Guild should draft measures within half a month and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau to convene the Loading and Unloading Rate Review Committee for review. The berthing fees collected by each wharf should be clearly stated on the loading and unloading labor fee receipts issued to the cargo owners to avoid confusion with sticking fees. (C) A proposal by the Inspection and Security Team to require merchants to issue guarantee letters for goods transported to Dinghai, Chongming, and Shazikou, was approved in principle. The Customs will work with the Inspection Team to draft detailed implementation measures.</p>

Section Chief Cao stated that the Section's investigation of black market gold and banknote cases is based entirely on reliable confidential reports. The disposal of confiscated gold and banknotes is determined by the Municipal Government's Economic Review Committee. Furthermore, the Section will legally protect legitimate silverware merchants, and they should not disturb themselves unnecessarily.</p>

<h3>On the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Line</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent's Speedy Dispatch from Shangrao, 2nd] Departing Jinhua by train, we arrived at the Jinhua River Bridge. This bridge was destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and is now being rebuilt. However, because the import of steel is difficult, it has been rebuilt using a wooden arch frame created by domestic engineers. The bridge is 282.954 meters long. I asked Mr. Hou Jiayuan, director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, who was traveling with me, how many years this bridge could last. He said: It can last at least five years. If it is inspected regularly and decaying wooden planks are replaced, it can last for a considerable period of time. Continuing forward, we arrived at Lingshan Port, which is within the territory of Longyou. There is also a large bridge at Lingshan Port, built using wooden trusses invented by foreigners. These wooden trusses are connected by steel rings, making them extremely strong. I saw several rows of bamboo rafts on Lingshan Port. Boatmen were wading through the water, dragging the bamboo rafts across the shallows. I asked them where they came from. They said they had come to the city yesterday to sell "yellow paper." It turned out that this place produces paper used for burning to ghosts and deities, which is sold in the Subei area.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's History Has Been Full of Twists and Turns</p>
<p>While in the train, Mr. Hou Jiayuan told us the history of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: "In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the Zhejiang Provincial Government surveyed Tonglu and built the Guanxi Railway Line. However, it cost 150,000 yuan per mile. Later, with a grant of 300,000 yuan, they resolutely wanted to build the railway. Because they did not obtain central government approval to build a railway, they changed it to the Xiaoshan-Changshan Highway. Zhejiang Province then used its own financial resources to rebuild the Xiaoshan-Changshan Light Railway. Because standard steel rails were expensive, light rails were cheaper. At that time, Germany was promoting foreign trade, so it sold light rails to Zhejiang Province on credit. Thus, a standard gauge and light railway were built. Because the Quzhou-Changshan project was difficult to do, it was changed to Jiangshan, and thus named the Hangzhou-Jiang Railway, which is now the roadbed of the Zhejiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. However, at that time, the section between Xiaoshan and Zhuji was being converted from a highway to a railway, so there were many curved paths, which is still the case today. Later, Zhejiang Province issued construction bonds, sold the Hangzhou Power Plant, and built the railway to Lanxi. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), they borrowed money from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to buy steel rails, and in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), they borrowed money from construction bonds to complete the section to Wangshan. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Fujian Incident occurred, and the central government relied on this railway to quickly put down the incident, thus emphasizing the importance of this railway. This prompted the Ministry of Railways to allocate a portion of the construction bonds it issued to build it. Jiangxi also issued construction bonds. Zhang Gongquan also introduced a loan from Germany for steel rails, guaranteed by the Bank of China, so that the Yushan section could be completed with heavy rails and renamed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After 18 months of work, it was opened to traffic in Nanchang in January of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and in August of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), it was opened to traffic to Pingxiang. The section from Zhuzhou to Pingxiang was also handed over to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for management.</p>
<p>Full Line to Open to Traffic Next Autumn</p>
<p>With the railway completed, the War of Resistance broke out, and military transport was frequent. It was originally planned to replace the heavy rails on the section from Hangzhou to Wangshan, but when the War of Resistance began, the section from Hangzhou to Zhuji was demolished first, then the section from Zhuji to Jinhua, then the section from Nanchang to Pingxiang, and finally the section from Zhuzhou to Pingxiang. The Japanese enemy, in order to transport Jiangxi grain, rebuilt the railway from Hangzhou to Jinhua, and before the victory, they dismantled the section to Zhuji again. Immediately after this dismantling, the Japanese surrendered and only the section from Hangzhou to Zhuji was not dismantled. Before the victory, the Third War Zone had requested military traffic between Shangrao and Quzhou. At the time of the Japanese surrender the sections between Quzhou and Shangrao and between Hangzhou and Zhuji were opened to traffic, but the sections between Zhuji and Jinhua, between Jinhua and Quzhou and between Quzhou and Shangrao were difficult to restore due to the excessive number of bridges. Now our department is striving with all its strength to achieve full line operation. It can be said that we will be able to get through to Nanchang by the end of next month or the beginning of January, and the full line will be open to traffic in August or September of next year.” We understand that this difficult Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is truly a valuable page in the history of the engineering world. We believe that the more difficult it is, the stronger it will become, and it will surely have a different kind of brilliance under a thousand hammers and refinements.</p>
<p>Two Statues Carved in Three Years at Lu's Tomb</p>
<p>While we were talking, we arrived in Yuzhou. While the car was stopped briefly, it let us enter the city for a visit. We arrived at the official residence of the Confucius Officiant, and requested the Kong family to bring out the Confucius statue for viewing. They immediately brought it out. Confucius and his wife were both carved from wood, each statue five inches wide and one foot three inches long. According to the old lady of the Kong family, "As far back as the Southern Song Dynasty, Duan Yougong, a direct descendant of the 46th generation, brought these two statues from Qufu when he crossed south. These statues were made of *kaimu* wood. There is *kaimu* wood between the tombs of Confucius. In those days, Zigong guarded the tomb for three years, and carved these statues from *kaimu* wood. The Kong family is now in the 75th generation. The Officiant is Kong Fanhao. After Fanhao's death, his younger brother Fan Ying's son Xiangkai inherited the position." She told us that the Kong family in Qufu, Shandong, wanted them to return, but because they had lived here for several generations, and in the situation of "preferring relatives over honor," they were willing to stay where they were. As for the current Officiant, before the war, his salary was 430 yuan per month. As for who is the direct descendant between him and the one in Qufu now, this can only be decided and verified by studying the Kong family tree and the research of archaeologists.</p>
<p>Yuzhou has several uneven roads. The Pacification Headquarters is located here, and there are quite a few shops. The local produce is oranges and winter bamboo shoots. Oranges cost 1,000 yuan each, and winter bamboo shoots cost 16,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>The Land Is Barren and the Population Is Increasingly Sparse</p>
<p>Returning to the station, we boarded the train to continue our journey. The pine trees on both sides of the land are about to become a forest, which is pleasing to the eye. However, in many places, there is no one cultivating the land. Once we entered the territory of Jiangxi, it became even more apparent that there was more wasteland and a sparser population. When the train arrived in Shangrao, the platform was woven into a shed with bamboo leaves and bamboo strips, which can also be said to be a difficult undertaking. This place produces jujubes, pears, rice, oil, etc. A large amount of goods were piled up at the station. According to transportation personnel, 3,000 tons of goods travel on the road between Hangzhou and Shangrao every day.</p>
<p>The train continued forward, revealing a more desolate scene. The mountains on both sides undulated. Passing Jieyan Mountain, we saw a giant cave running through the mountains, looking much like an elephant's trunk. When the train arrived at Fenglingtou, we got off to see the coal mine at Kangkou. This coal seam extends from Shangrao in the west to Hengfeng, with reserves of 200 million tons. The mine is excavated manually, producing about 30 tons of bituminous coal per day, and 1,000 tons per month. There are more than 600 workers. There is a light railway between the mine and the railway, but the coal is transported by manpower pushing carts.</p>
<p>Industrial Power Quickly Recovering</p>
<p>It is said that the Pingxiang coal mine produced 3,000 tons of coal per day before the war, but now it only produces 3,000 tons per month. In order to revitalize Zhejiang's industry, coal is extremely important. We hope that idle capital will be invested here to quickly develop and restore the raw materials for this industrial power.</p>
<p>Boarding the train again, we arrived at Bingfeng Station, which is in the county. Because of the years of war and chaos, there are only a hundred households in the county town. The local produce is rice, but after all, because the land is vast and the population is sparse, there is not a large output. Proceeding further, we arrived at Yiyang Station, which is two kilometers from the county town. I asked a passerby how many people there were in the county. They replied that there were only two or three hundred households. The local produce is also rice.</p>
<p>Compared to Zhejiang and Jiangxi, Zhejiang can naturally be considered to be relatively well-off. Jiangxi, especially the places we passed through, the scene after the disaster, is nakedly presented before your eyes, causing you to think of the disaster of that year. At the same time, it inspires a fervent admiration for those who are now working hard to rebuild. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Discovery of "Xiantian Dao" Den in Wuxi Huishan Wenchang Pavilion; Buddhist Hall Used as Cover for Resurgence; Secrets Leaked Due to Discord Between Master and Disciples</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Wuxi Bureau, 2nd] During the period of enemy occupation in Xiyi (Wuxi), the "Xiantian Dao" (Way of Former Heaven) cult was discovered in the four rural districts. It used claims of invulnerability to knives and guns to deceive the ignorant masses. For a time, hundreds of thousands of people blindly followed it. Later, the enemy army shot and killed Jiang Mingbi, a man from Anhui who claimed to be the leader of the "Xiantian Dao," and the cult disappeared. Since the victory, however, the cult has shown signs of resurgence. The authorities have repeatedly issued strict orders to ban it in various places. Recently, the county police bureau received a tip-off that Ma Zhengrun, an old Taoist priest at the Wenchang Pavilion in Huishan, was the leader of the Xiantian Dao cult. He usually spread rumors to confuse the public and was suspected of instigating illegal activities such as robbery and abduction of women. Upon receiving the report, the police bureau ordered the criminal investigation team to go to the address yesterday and arrest the suspect, who confessed to being the leader of the Xiantian Dao without hesitation.</p>
<p>A Grand Title</p>
<p>The suspect, Ma, is 54 years old and originally from Jingjiang. He has resided in the Fudetan (Assisting Virtue Altar) at Daixi Bridge in Wujin for a long time. Since the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), Ma has been using the Wenchang Pavilion in Huishan to promote Buddhism and performing rituals as a cover for his evil activities. He has misled the ignorant masses, who flocked to him, and the incense was flourishing, shining brightly along with the Buddhist hall set up by the famous Three Old Ladies on a nearby mountain. He usually pretended to teach Buddhist scriptures and recruited young women to live in the hall. Over the years, he has established a foundation in the local area, organized groups, and called himself "Director of Propaganda for the Wuxi Kangjian (Health) Society," "Director of the Xiantian Buddhist Gate Persuasion Society," "Director of the Huishan Geliu (Lane) Association," "Chief Supervisor of the Huishan Buddhist Health Association," and "Instructor and Manager of the Zhonghua (China) Buddhist Society." He had various titles and numerous designations, and also used aliases such as Ma Zhengxiang, Ma Zhengren, Ma Yuting, and also styled himself Defeng (Virtue Wind). When Ma preached in Houteng, Jiangyin, he was given the honorable title of "Ma Changxian" (Flourishing Virtue of Ma) by the local community, demonstrating his influence.</p>
<p>Flower-Picking Master</p>
<p>In September of this year, the Jiangyin County government arrested a robber named Zhu Zhangsheng, who was a local murderer and expert in abducting women. It turned out that he was also a disciple of Ma. At that time, letters addressed to Ma's two mistresses in Wuxi were found on Zhu. One was a female cultivator in Ma's Buddhist hall, who was of marriageable age, and the other was a nun. The letters not only revealed the intimate relationship between Zhu and the two women, but also involved Ma's adulterous affairs. In a letter to Yulian, he wrote: "She is a wealthy lady. Ma Changxian is a flower-picking master and would do such shameless things. I was in Houcheng and saw his every move, and it was exactly as I suspected. Later, I heard in Chenggougang that you and Lingmei had also suffered from his actions. Also, a monk in the Jingjie (Respecting Chastity) Hall in Xiyangqiao told me that he had also harassed them. This is the true feeling of a Taoist friend of Taibai who confesses without being forced." In a letter to Ruiqin, he wrote: "I lightly stepped into your esteemed hall, and I am deeply grateful for your love and affection, which has left a mark on my spine… You are also a clever intellectual, but you probably understand that Ma is a slippery character. Miss, why does Ma Changxian often come to your hall, and he is a Taoist friend who picks flowers." Ma's affairs with the two women were fully revealed on paper.</p>
<p>Resurrection of the Dead</p>
<p>Recently, Ma used a large sum of 600 shi (about 60,000 kg) of white rice to build another Buddhist hall on the side of the mountain. He has already paid 100 shi for materials, and is raising the remaining funds from the nearby villagers. However, he was reported and arrested. The criminal investigation team seized propaganda materials of the Xiantian Dao called "Bitter Sea Compassionate Voyage" and "Thunder Gate Ascending to Heaven Scripture." When asked about their meaning, he claimed that they were to encourage people to do good deeds. In the Thunder Gate Ascending to Heaven Scripture, there was also a "method for understanding the resurrection of the dead." The text read: "When a person dies, do not cry. Quickly find a quiet place and have someone watch over them until twelve o'clock without speaking. Gently call out with joy and wash the face with cold water." When asked if the dead could be resurrected, he claimed he did not know. When asked to explain the meaning of the two characters "Xiantian" (Former Heaven), he said, "It is said in the medical books about the theory of Xiantian and Houtian (Later Heaven). We understood it ourselves and used the name Xiantian." Ma has a vulgar and wretched appearance. He wears a felt hat and a homespun cloth garment, looking like a country bumpkin. He murmurs Buddhist chants in his mouth. The criminal investigation team has already presented Ma to the headquarters for interrogation last night. If he is found to be a demon engaging in activities under a false name, he will be sent to the military law office of the county government for strict punishment.</p>

<h3>Regulations on Academic and Written Examination Rewards for Civil Servants Established by the Executive Yuan; Full Text of Six Articles Has Been Communicated to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The Ministry of Education has received an order from the Executive Yuan regarding the six articles of the Regulations on Academic and Written Examination Rewards for Civil Servants. The main points are as follows: The Examination Yuan has specially formulated reward measures to improve the effectiveness of academic and written examinations for civil servants. Those who achieve a first-class or higher ranking in the examinations will be exempted from the corresponding subjects when participating in higher or ordinary qualification examinations. At the end of the year, the service unit's performance evaluation committee will increase the academic score of the examinee based on the following grades, but the total academic score after the increase shall not exceed the statutory maximum academic score. If the examinee's service unit fails to increase the academic score, the Ministry of Personnel will notify the original service unit to provide the increase. (A) Super-grade: 5 points; (B) Special grade: 4 points; (C) First grade: 3 points. The increased academic score should be specified in the remarks column of the performance evaluation form. If the increase in academic score results in the examinee being ranked first-class, causing the number of personnel ranked first-class to exceed the limit stipulated in Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Servant Performance Evaluation Regulations, the head of the service unit should reduce the score of the personnel with the lower total score. If the total scores are the same, the academic score of the personnel with the lower academic score should be reduced. If the total scores of the examinee and other personnel are the same, the head of the unit should rank the examinee higher when determining the ranking. After the results of the annual academic and written examinations are announced, the Examination Committee should send the grade results of the examinees from each unit to the respective service units for processing in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of these regulations. It should also prepare a general roster of the examinees from each unit, detailing the rank and grade of the examinee's position in the service unit, and submit it to the Ministry of Personnel for registration.</p>

<h3>Professors at Shanxi University Collectively Request Leave; Requesting the Allocation of In-Kind Benefits as Precedent</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Taiyuan Bureau, 2nd] Professors at Shanxi University hosted reporters at 2:00 PM on the 2nd and issued a declaration. The words were sad and sincere. The declaration included: "Prices are soaring, which is the case throughout the country. The situation in Taiyuan is particularly severe. Not to mention goods from other places, flour has risen to 1.1 million yuan, which is more than twice the price in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. The salary income is not enough to feed a family of three. We have repeatedly requested the precedent of allocations in Tianjin and other universities, but have not been granted. Under the pressure of the situation, the entire faculty has resolved to collectively request leave starting from the 1st. Although we are willing to teach, we cannot bear the hunger and cold. If we can get enough to eat, who would be willing to beg for a few dou (pecks) of rice? Although the students' classes will be suspended during the leave period, we are still willing to provide guidance at any time to prevent them from being wasted."</p>

<h3>Zhonghua Xueyi (Arts and Sciences) Society Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Resolved to Strengthen Japanese Studies; and Actively Promote Electrified Education</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Bureau] The Zhonghua Xueyi Society held its 30th-anniversary celebration yesterday. Branches across the country held celebrations in nine districts simultaneously. The first postwar annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou District was held at the society's address on Shaoxing Road in the city yesterday morning. Seventy members including Luo Zonglu and Li Yutian attended. Representatives from various branches also participated. Chairman Cheng Shizhen said in his speech that when the Zhonghua Xueyi Society was first founded in Japan, there were only a few dozen members. Since then, it has grown to more than 2,200 members. Today, on the 30th anniversary, the country is divided into nine districts, and celebrations are held on the same day. We should silently remember the hard work of the late Director He Bingsong in founding the society. (There was a three-minute silence). He then put forward three points: Each should use his expertise to develop research capabilities; As the Society was founded in Japan, we should conduct special research on Japanese issues; Our country should follow the path of democracy and peace and take on the mission of promoting East Asian culture. Then, Director Zhou Shouchang reported on the preparations for the annual meeting. Li Ximou, the acting director of the Education Bureau, said in his speech that the establishment of world academic institutions often starts with the efforts of private groups and then becomes national academic institutions, such as the Royal Society of the United Kingdom. He hoped that the Zhonghua Xueyi Society would devote more effort to promoting academic research. Ren Hongjun, the representative of the Zhonghua Natural Science Society, said in his speech that when the Zhonghua Xueyi Society was first established in Japan, many Chinese students in Japan were active in politics and ideology. Later, they realized that academics were more important and engaged in scientific research. Zhang Jusheng, an honorary member of the Society, delivered a speech with painful words. He said that Japan's construction in Taiwan and Northeast China over the past decades has achieved amazing results, but after our country took over, we failed to utilize them and allowed them to be abandoned and destroyed. In the future, we should be vigilant and seek academic self-reliance. Then, representatives from various branches and the Society's Secretary-General Li Yutian reported on the Society's affairs and the tasks of the annual meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. All members attended a luncheon hosted by Mayor Wu, who delivered a speech and expressed his admiration for the Society's emphasis on both science and morality. The general meeting was resumed at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, presided over by Luo Zonglu, who announced eight papers. Gao Zhongqin demonstrated the Chinese electric typewriter. Mr. Gao said that he has now manufactured four typewriters at a cost of 400,000 US dollars. If mass production is possible, the cost can be reduced. The training time for Chinese typists is six months, which is the same as the time required to learn English typing. Then, the discussion of the proposals began and the following were passed: Hiring special researchers; Holding academic lectures; Actively promoting electrified education; Strengthening Japanese studies; Raising funds; Revising the Society's charter, to be handled by the board of directors. At 7:00 PM, there was a dinner, as well as performances such as Ouyang Yuqian's "Extra Performance" and movies. The Society displayed Japanese books, published works, ancient Han and Tang figurines and artifacts, as well as paintings by members, flowers, fish, insects, and four scenes from Sun Yat-sen's hometown, all of which are valuable works. The exhibition will end on the 7th.</p>

<p>[United Press, Manila, 3rd] The Lianhua Team, the strong Malayan Overseas Chinese football team, played against the Manila Team here on the 2nd. The Lianhua Team easily defeated the Philippine team 6-0. For the first 25 minutes after the start of the game, both sides played cautiously and achieved nothing. Before the end of the first half, the fast-paced Lianhua Team scored four goals in a row. Left inside forward Xie Wenliang made a quick shot from 25 yards and opened the scoring. Three minutes later, Xie Wenliang received a pass from the left wing and scored another goal. Then, right forward Huang Guo added icing on the cake and scored two more goals. The visiting team defended with all its strength in the second half. Ten minutes later, left forward Hu Wenxiang scored a goal. Five minutes later, Hu scored another goal, winning the game 6-0.

<h3>Western Overseas Chinese Football Team, White Eagle Team Disbanded</h3>

<h3>Analysis of Shantou Team's Victory: Unleashing the Peak Era Speed</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Last night at the Municipal Gymnasium, over two thousand fans watched intently a rare, exciting, and intense basketball game. The score was also unprecedentedly high.</p>
<p>The Oil Team endured great hardship to win the final victory. Through the entire fierce battle, there was a deeper understanding of the strength of the American military's Topeka team. The American team aimed to exchange skills and did not focus on winning or losing. In the first half, the score was 22 to 23. The American team's elite players were replaced by entirely new forces, resulting in a loss of six or seven points. The inability to catch up in the second half was one of the reasons for Topeka's defeat last night.</p>
<p>Given that the China United team defeated the Topeka team by three points last week, and that Da Li did not participate in that game, the Shantou team gained some confidence psychologically. The change in strategy, unleashing the peak era's combat speed, was truly the only condition for the Shantou team's victory. In the first half, Chen Qingjiang's lively scoring entirely depended on fast dribbling, thus leading from afar. In the second half, Chen Qingjiang was exhausted and injured, and Ji Nankang replaced him, greatly reducing the team's speed. If it weren't for Lin Weiting's forty-five-degree mid-range sharpshooting, the Topeka team would undoubtedly have surpassed them. Cai Yanxiong's command of the offense, and Ma Zai and Li De's defense, all exerted their greatest effort.</p>
<p>For the Topeka team, Meyer and Hui Pei were still the best, and Pei Han also had a better performance than last week. Black player Bowser only focused on offense and ignored defense last night, allowing Chen Qingjiang to repeatedly receive passes and score with ease. Of course, the merits did not outweigh the demerits.</p>
<p>Comparing Lato of Topeka with "Columbus," who came to Shanghai this spring, the former appeared weaker, while Columbus's center, Ash, was more agile, which Meyer could not match. (Chang Nian)</p>
<p>Final Half Minute Decides the Outcome: Shantou Team Wins by One Point Against the American Military Team: Topeka Loses 72 to 73</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A spirited and tense basketball friendly match was held at the Municipal Gymnasium at seven o'clock last night. The Shantou team defeated the American Navy's Topeka team by one point. There were over two thousand spectators. In the first half, Shantou team's Chen Qingjiang scored 19 points alone. Meyer was the most dynamic player for the Topeka team. Initially, the Shantou team seemed to have difficulty coordinating due to excessive nervousness. The team only found its normal state after five minutes. After that, the Shantou team took the advantage and led in score. The first half score was 36 to 29. The second half became even more intense. The Shantou team fought hard and ultimately won by a precious one point, 73 to 72, against the Topeka team. The game situation was as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, Shantou team's Cai Yanxiong was noticeably shorter than Meyer. Within a second, Topeka's Pei Han scored, showing off his skills. Shantou team's attempted shot missed, but the ball was seen hovering on the hoop. Li De and Wei Ting fought hard, narrowing the score to 7 to 4. The sailors made major personnel adjustments, tying the score at 11 points. Both sides displayed excellent shooting skills. The Shantou team led by two points at 17 to 15. The situation changed, and the Shantou team exceeded by one point again at 23 to 22. The sailors then made a complete change of personnel. The Shantou team maintained its advantage. The Shantou team led with 36 to 29 in the first half.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>The Topeka team had many substitute players. In the second half, they still fought with the same five players, waiting at ease. The sailors quickly caught up, tying the score at 40 points. At 46 to 41, Lin Weiting replaced Chen Qingjiang, and the score became 55 to 55 again. The Shantou team took the lead at 61 to 51, and the audience cheered. The foreign team substituted four players, tying the score again at 62 to 71. Lin Weiting shot from long distance, exceeding the score to 73 to 71. Cai committed a foul and was replaced by He Lide. Topeka's Meyer scored a free throw. As the clock rang, the score was 73 to 72, with the Shantou team winning by only one point.</p>
<p>Shantou Team Fouls Points</p>
<p>Chen Qingjiang 3 25</p>
<p>Lin Weiting 3 26</p>
<p>He Li 1 11</p>
<p>Ji Nankang 1 5</p>
<p>Cai Yanxiong 5 4</p>

<h3>President Zhang of the Central Bank Discusses the Mission of the Financial Administration</h3>
<p>Emphasizing the Review of Commercial Bank Loans</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] When this reporter inquired about the establishment of the Financial Administration, President Zhang of the Central Bank replied: The Financial Administration's duties are broadly twofold. On the positive side, it assists various industries and businesses in obtaining legitimate working capital. For example, it supports cotton mills in purchasing raw cotton, weaving factories in purchasing cotton yarn, and other industries in purchasing raw materials, so that they can promptly engage in production and lower product prices, thus effectively reducing the burden on consumers. On the negative side, it prevents funds from being used for hoarding or speculation, so that goods are not exploited layer by layer, unreasonably raising prices and increasing the burden on consumers. During wartime, all bank loans in the United States and Britain had to be reviewed by the national banks of both countries, such as the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England, for this very reason. It is hoped that the Financial Administration will carry out this important task with the most fair and reasonable spirit. He also said: Loans from national banks will be difficult to restore before the market stabilizes. The Financial Administration focuses on reviewing loans to commercial banks and companies.</p>
<h3>Li Lixia Summoned to Beijing</h3>

According to reports, Mr. Li is currently the director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, and the deputy director, Bi Delin, is currently an assistant in the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Control of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Silk and Weaving Association Reportedly to be Abolished; New Organizational Regulations Currently Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The principle of comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth has been approved by the central authorities. It is reported that the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee will be abolished and a cotton yarn and cloth control agency will be established. Its organizational regulations, responsibilities, and control plans are currently being drafted in detail. The general principles are nothing more than the centralized procurement and allocation of raw cotton, and the complete entrusted spinning and weaving of cotton yarn and cloth, in order to rationalize the acquisition, distribution, production, transportation, sales, and supply of cotton yarn and cloth in three stages, and to achieve long-term stability in the price of cotton yarn and cloth. If the comprehensive control situation is realized, the pilot plan for joint distribution of cotton yarn, which has been discussed for a long time, will be virtually cancelled.</p>
<p>[Another report] Yuan Liang, chairman of the Silk and Weaving Association, has returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Unchanged Yesterday</h3>

In total, 2,909 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 3,753 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>Coarse Yarn Prices Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, the sales of fine yarn turned sluggish, and prices fell. Coarse yarn was firmer, but trading was very light. Only 20-count and 16-count coarse yarns sold slightly better, with robust demand from various regions. As a result, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn dropped by 600,000 to 47.4 million yuan, 40-count yarn dropped by 900,000 to 1.15 million yuan, while coarse yarn prices rose slightly by 100,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Slightly Better</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, the local market absorbed some at the opening, and merchants also came to purchase. Later, due to unfavorable news, buyers were cautious, and off-market participants were rarely active, and the market appeared lackluster. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths improved by 5,000 to 22,000-23,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge, straight bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth were firmer, while other cloths were stable.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Slightly Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was mixed, with both rises and falls. Local cotton remained firm, but trading was limited. Lingbao stock delivery was trading at 4.547 million yuan, 70,000-80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Shashi was at 4.63 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan, with 490 bales traded.

Yesterday, 120-count Asahi A grade glossy rayon opened at 96 million yuan, rose to 70 million yuan at noon, remained unchanged in the afternoon, and finally rose to 80 million yuan. 4A Peacock Globe glossy rayon was trading at around 89 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, factory sentiments were quite stable. Factories did not sell cheaply due to high costs, so transactions were very sparse. Asking prices at all levels were similar to the previous day, and prices for individual transactions were also similar to the previous day. Ordinary individual transactions were still priced at around 62 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was slightly higher. Dasheng and Huaqiang silk bedding opened at around 9 million yuan and gradually rose. At the close, they were trading at 9.7 million yuan. In the afternoon, they were offered for sale at 30 million yuan. Dasheng checkered crepe remained at around 120,000 yuan. High-end Hua brocade crepe had transactions at 68,000 yuan. Other goods were stable as on the previous day.</p>
<p>Domestic Tea Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, domestic tea sales continued in local shops and stores, and prices were consistently firm. As for the foreign tea market, English merchants resumed their focus on this year's Qimen black tea, and trading was acceptable, with little fluctuation in the market. As for green tea varieties, export firms were still hesitant due to the distant shipping dates, while sellers continued to defend prices, so the process was still characterized by scarce supply and demand, and transactions were sluggish, with the situation revolving.</p>

Paper and Xiangtai fell by more than ten percent, telephone and tramway shares fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Buying Interest Slightly Active; Chinese Shares Initially Lower, Then Recovered</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the news that Li Lixia would concurrently head the Shanghai Financial Administration stabilized various markets. The stock market also reflected this very well. Exchange at the National Bank was still not as tight as desired. Buyers gradually became active, initially lower, then recovered.</p>

No. 117 was still maintaining, and spot and forward Yongsasha both closed at a price of 358 yuan. After the close, off-market bids rose again and recovered. As a result, compared to the previous close for immediate delivery shares, Neiyi rose by half a percent, Zhabei fell by half a percent, and Yongsasha, Yonggong, Zhongfang, Zhongs, Zhongni, Zhongxing, Xinya, and Wei rose slightly. Xinnuo, Huaxin, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Sino-French, Xinhua, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Guohuo fell slightly. Meiya, Match, and Jinglun were flat. Forward delivery shares saw Yongsasha rise slightly, Qinxing was flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>After-market forward delivery was suspended as usual. After opening for immediate delivery Yongsasha, No. 207 and others sold from 362 yuan to 360 yuan. No. 65 and others came to buy. The exchange situation at the National Bank did not improve much. Prices had risen to 368 yuan. No. 224 and others sold, and it was rumored that a certain firm was unstable, falling back to 362 yuan. No. 220 and others still bought, and then closed at a price of 366 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Zhabei Match recovered half a percent, Neiyi Jinglun was still flat, and the rest of the shares rose slightly. Off-market old shares generally showed some weakness and fatigue.</p>

There was not much bran in stock, and prices rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cake and oil residue were purchased in Taiwan, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Local merchants were active in purchasing soybeans, and oil factories absorbed them at low prices. The market was stable. Soybean dregs were actively sold, rising by 10,000 yuan. Mung beans were still lackluster, with a slight recovery in weakness. Red beans were dull, red beans were still not traded, and soy beans were also lackluster.</p>
<p>Red sorghum rose completely by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Corn was re-adopted by the northern ocean, and the surge began again, soaring by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Sesame oil factories and local merchants opportunistically absorbed them, while foreign merchants were inactive. The market was stable and tight. Raw peanuts were quiet among Guangdong merchants, but sales in the local market were good, with firm prices. Merchants from Ningbo slightly increased their purchases of the oil market. Raw oil continued to rise by 60,000-70,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose by another 50,000-60,000 yuan. Refined oil and bean oil rose slightly by 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Publishing World Weekly</p>
<h3>The Editor's Hopes</h3>
<p>— Traditional First</p>
<p>This weekly will be expanding its content and scope starting in December. On the one hand, this shows the spirit of promoting academics by the editorial department of this newspaper, and on the other hand, it is also due to the enthusiastic support of our readers. At a time when labor and paper are expensive, we book-loving friends feel burdened by the high cost of buying books. Some people may go to bookstores to browse briefly, but if you read for too long, the bookstore clerks may "look at you differently," so it is not convenient to stay long. Even readers who have some ability to buy books cannot buy all the books to read. Therefore, this weekly has two missions: introducing content; criticizing strengths and weaknesses. When we introduce the content of a book, first, we must of course choose good books; second, we must refine the essence of the whole book; third, our own introduction should also be a good essay or short story. When we criticize the strengths and weaknesses of a book, first, we must strive to eliminate personal grievances; second, we must not only promote the good but also eliminate the bad; third, we must have some expertise in the field we are criticizing, and our criticism must be based on correct academic principles.</p>
<p>The above are some points of self-encouragement for the editor and the contributors. We are confident that although we have not reached our ideal, we are moving in that direction. Recently, the manuscripts we have received are quite good, and the writers also have expertise. The editor's selection is also very strict. The authors of 90% of the manuscripts published in this weekly before were unknown to the editor. But we also do not bury the works of young writers. We encourage young people to read, encourage them to write down their experiences, and submit them to this weekly. We always publish the best.</p>
<p>The content of this weekly is hoped to be developed in a multi-faceted and balanced way. We receive the most manuscripts on the review of novels. This type of manuscript is the easiest to write, but the most difficult to write beautifully. In the future, we hope to publish more of this type of manuscript in each issue, because readers also prefer to read this type of article. We receive relatively few manuscripts on the introduction of natural science books, but most of them are useful. However, we hope that the teachers who write this type of manuscript will introduce more advanced scientific theories and popular practical science books, and make the writing slightly more literary. The strangest thing is that we receive the fewest manuscripts on social sciences or humanities. I think this may be because too few famous works in this area have been published recently. But we also welcome introductions to famous Chinese and Western works in philosophy and sociology throughout history.</p>
<p>In short, we very much hope that this weekly is not just a "book primer," but a publication with academic value. Our interests are advanced and multi-faceted; our attitude is cautious and objective; our academic stance is to advocate rigorous critical dialectics, but we absolutely despise personal grievances mixed in. Finally, we hope that writers will give us more manuscripts and readers will continue to encourage and guide us.</p>
<h3>Children's Drawing Psychology</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Authored by Helga Eng, translated by Gong Qichang, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Generally, teachers of children's drawing often use adult standards to judge children's work, which stifles the lively and active ability of children to express themselves through drawing. If teachers can pay attention to the psychology of children's drawing and study it, this kind of anti-educational method will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Regarding the study of children's drawing psychology, we can often find some short articles and fragments in domestic educational publications. However, systematic and specialized research results include only Huang’s "Psychology of Children's Drawing" (Commercial Press edition) and the one I am introducing now. The former is a research report using group methods, which I plan to introduce next time. The latter is the result of the author's biographical study of her niece Margaret's drawing psychology, combined with the translator's personal research achievements in the children's drawing studies at the Central University Experimental School. It is not a complete translation.</p>
<p>I also obtained a Japanese translation elsewhere, co-translated by Otomo Kazumi and the International Bookstore Editorial Department, which is complete. According to the Japanese translation, Eng's original work is divided into four chapters: 1. From the first stroke to eight years old - color. 2. An overview of the psychological development of children's drawings. 3. Children's realistic paintings expressing spiritual development. 4. Children and primitive art.</p>
<p>However, in Gong’s translated book, he only translated her second chapter and incorporated his own research, resulting in the following items:</p>
<p>Introduction. Scribbling. From Scribbling to Pictorial Drawing. Pictorial Drawing. Automatism. Direction. Perspective or Background. Proportion. Action. Color. Decoration.</p>
<p>Under the name "Scribbling," it is found that children's expression uses only three kinds of lines: undulating scribbles, circular scribbles, and chaotic scribbles.</p>
<p>During the period "From Scribbling to Pictorial Drawing," children will inevitably give names to the things they draw, or announce what they are going to draw before starting.</p>
<p>The "Pictorial Drawing" section describes the developmental order of drawing people, which is to draw the head first, then the body, feet, and finally the arms, as well as the order of drawing animals, plants, houses, etc.</p>
<p>The so-called "Automatism" means that after the number of repetitions of drawing reaches a considerable number, the drawing process becomes very mechanical, which becomes a kind of "automatism." It also refers to the phenomenon when drawing is transitioning to a new format but still does not depart from the old format. For example, children often draw two eyes on a profile portrait, which is what this means.</p>
<p>The "Direction" section points out the phenomenon and causes of position reversal errors in children's drawings. Because children's observation of the structure of the world is slightly less habitual than adults, this phenomenon roughly occurs in new forms that children do not know.</p>
<p>"Perspective and Background" cannot be expressed in children's drawings, and the expression of perspective depends on the degree of development of abstract feeling and complex natural synthesis ability. Therefore, children may not be able to use perspective methods and comprehensive expression of complex scenes until they are fourteen years old.</p>
<p>The lack of correct proportions in children's drawings is common in the relationship between various parts of a certain shape, or in the combination relationship between people and objects. The "Proportion" section explains that children cannot obtain the concept of the whole because they do not have sufficient comprehensive ability.</p>
<p>Regarding the behavior of "Action," we can clearly distinguish it, and it will probably be found in the drawings of sixteen-year-old children.</p>
<p>Children's use of "Color" in drawing is possible at about eight years old. At five or six years old, they always like to use colorless outlines to draw the general forms of things. In this section, the translator further incorporates the research results of children's preferences for colors: yellow is the most frequently chosen, followed by blue, then green, and the number of choices for other colors. (The author also has similar research, which is included in my book "Research on Color Science" — Commercial Press edition)</p>
<p>In the "Decoration" section, it is explained that early children's drawings do not have exquisite original decorations, because descriptive drawing was discovered early on, and decorative drawing has a place at least after the age of six.</p>
<p>When conducting research, the author adopted many experts' opinions and results for reference. Although the translator did not translate the entire book, he carefully permeated his own research results into it, which is also worthy of praise. The author, Ms. Eng, is a Norwegian and a renowned psychologist who has not only conducted in-depth research on children's drawing but also has rich research on children's language and emotions.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Post-War Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>Authored by Zhao Zengjue, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>The most important thing for China after the war is construction. Regarding construction policies, many contemporary scholars have discussed them: some advocate national defense first, and national defense should be constructed first; some advocate people's livelihood first, and people's livelihood should be constructed first; some advocate that industry is more important than agriculture, and industrialization should be implemented, or advocate that agriculture is more important than industry, and the country should be established on agriculture. Which is right and which is wrong, I am not prepared to discuss here, but one point must be raised, that is, no matter what is constructed, transportation is indispensable. With transportation, everything can be constructed quickly and smoothly. To give an example before our eyes, the millions of tons of industrial equipment that Japan is now compensating us require an appropriate number of ships to transport them back, and this is a problem for us. Therefore, we can say that transportation construction is the foundation of all construction and is more important than all construction in the construction process.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Communications had already mobilized many experts and spent a lot of time preparing a draft outline of transportation construction, which was submitted to the Central Design Bureau for review and approval for implementation. Mr. Zhao Zengjue, the author of this book, was then the Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications and a member of the Central Design Bureau, and participated in the preparation of this outline. Therefore, he now compiles this outline together with his personal works and other relevant important documents into this book. According to what he said in the foreword of the book, in view of the importance of transportation construction, he compiled this book while post-war construction is about to begin, to provide academic circles with materials for continued research, which is indeed very meaningful.</p>
<p>The entire book consists of nine parts and fifty-one chapters. The first part includes the construction outline, implementation principles, and a general explanation of the outline and principles, making a comprehensive and principled plan for the six major constructions of railways, highways, shipping, civil aviation, telecommunications, and post offices; the second part makes concrete plans for the above six constructions in the five years after the war; the following parts discuss each construction separately. Some of the claims are the same as the outline, which can be used as a supplementary explanation of the outline; some are different, but they are enough for comparative research. It can be seen from the above that the compiler has spent some deliberation when compiling the data.</p>
<p>That draft outline is the most important part of the whole book. It is a kind of improved, progressive, and complete plan that is indeed based on theory and takes into account reality. The following is an introduction to several of its key points:</p>
<p>Transportation undertakings should be coordinated with national economic construction. Since transportation construction is the foundation of all construction, it should be coordinated with all construction to promote its development. The reason is very simple. Now, according to the first article of the outline, "Transportation construction aims to provide safe, convenient, and affordable transportation and communication equipment to serve the public, promote national industrialization, improve people's welfare, and assist the development of national culture." It has indeed taken into account the people's livelihood and national defense that urgently need to be constructed after the war, because the premise of people's livelihood and national defense construction is industrialization. Now that the goal of transportation construction is to promote national industrialization, it is to promote people's livelihood and national defense construction. Moreover, in the past, our transportation construction was biased and uneven, focusing on cities and ignoring rural areas, focusing on the southeast region and ignoring the rear; and even in the same transportation undertaking, such as railways, water transport, highways, and air transport, and telecommunications and post offices, there was a lack of due coordination and connection. However, in the new plan, these shortcomings have been corrected.</p>
<p>Administrative and business operations should be divided, and business operations should be enterprise-oriented. In the past, our highest administrative organs for transportation were executing national transportation policies on the one hand and also handling transportation business on the other hand, which was really unreasonable. Now the outline divides administration and business operations, so that the highest administrative organs specialize in administration, while separate business management organs are set up to supervise and manage business operations, in order to maintain the unity of administration. As for business organs, it is advocated to be as enterprise-oriented as possible to increase efficiency. These are all progressive methods.</p>
<p>Specify the boundaries between state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned transportation undertakings. What kind of business model a country's transportation undertaking should adopt depends on its political system, economic capacity, and national defense status. In the past, our transportation undertakings were sometimes state-owned and sometimes privately-owned, without a fixed standard, so that conflicts often occurred between the central and local governments, or between the government and the people, and even conflicts occurred between central and local agencies, which affected the development of transportation undertakings. Now this outline makes rigid regulations on which transportation undertakings should be state-owned, which should be publicly-owned, which should be privately-owned, or which should be allowed to be privately-owned in addition to state-owned and publicly-owned. In this way, not only will it be convenient to execute in the future because there is a standard to follow, but these regulations are fundamentally reasonable.</p>
<p>Specify the methods of absorbing foreign capital. We must use foreign capital for construction after the war, and the reason need not be repeated. However, we need foreign capital, and there should be certain conditions and certain methods, otherwise it is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. It is foreign capital that is using us, not us using foreign capital. The methods of absorbing foreign capital specified in this outline are divided into: (A) issuing bonds, (B) general credit or material loans, (C) joint ventures, and (D) franchise operations. The essence is to plan and control in a unified way and manage according to law. Compared with the past style of individual loans and individual responsibilities for each transportation undertaking, only paying attention to the present and not the future, it is indeed much more progressive. In the past, when borrowing money to build railways, whoever's money was borrowed, whose locomotives, engineers, and engineering specifications were used. As a result, our railways became a world railway exposition, causing major difficulties in transportation and management. In the future, if we follow the new regulations, this phenomenon will not happen again. Moreover, the new outline stipulates that past transportation debts should be uniformly reorganized and repaid by the central government to establish credit, which is also the wisest way.</p>
<p>Other provisions, such as unified engineering specifications and unified management systems, are briefly specified, and will not be repeated here. We believe that after reading this book, we can get a clear outline of the prospects for our post-war transportation construction. To this day, this book is still the first specialized work in the country that discusses transportation construction with correct theories and concrete plans!</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Discusses Mathematics</h3>
<p>— Zhonghuan</p>
<p>(One of the Kai Ming Youth Series, authored by Liu Xunyu.)</p>
<p>This "Mr. Ma Discusses Mathematics," like many other books by Mr. Liu, uses a "storytelling approach" to explain principles. It clearly expresses the attitude of learning mathematics, the path of thinking about problems, and the method of exploring the relationship and changes between topics. It is definitely not a detailed explanation of difficult problems. If someone is looking for a solution to a certain problem by flipping through it, this may disappoint them, although it collects more than one hundred problems and explains them.</p>
<p>However, the reason why the author is willing to sincerely introduce this book is because of its unique solution method. From beginning to end, this book uses graphical methods to calculate any problem. This is something that ordinary mathematics books do not cover, and it is also the most fascinating part of this book. Using graphical methods to solve mathematical problems is not only easy to observe but also makes arithmetic more practical. Graphical methods have already connected algebra and geometry to create analytic geometry. Now the author uses it in arithmetic, which not only helps to improve mathematics but is also quite beneficial for learning science, engineering, and even statistics.</p>
<p>This book is divided into thirty chapters, including clock problems, flowing water problems, age problems, and four arithmetic problems such as bird and animal groups. It also explains why ratios and fractions are suitable for first-year students because they are reviewing arithmetic at this time. In addition, those who are new to analytic geometry can improve their interest in analytic geometry by reading it.</p>
<p>Arithmetic is the foundation of all higher mathematics, algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and even calculus. We cannot ignore it. I hope that young people can make more use of this rare good book.</p>

Especially women, and especially women with sincere love and clear rationality, will bear a thousand times more pain than ordinary people have ever endured.</p>
<p>Ms. Xie Bingxin reveals the suffering of women in "Divorce" in a diary style, which further proves its reality.</p>
<p>It was by chance that I found this beautifully bound untitled collection on a friend's bookshelf. "Divorce" is one of the novellas in it. The entire collection contains twelve creations written recently by twelve female writers, and is edited by Ms. Zhao Qingge. Several female writers stopped writing for a long time, and specially rewrote for this "Modern Chinese Women Writers, Novel Special Collection." From here, we can very clearly admire the recent heroic posture of Chinese female writers.</p>
<p>The first article I opened and read was "Divorce," also because I hadn't seen Mr. Bingxin's short sword work for a long time, and also because the current Chinese society is also performing this tragedy.</p>
<p>The story is like this: Wang Manyin, a heroine who graduated from middle school and has been working hard at home for her children for nearly ten years, resolutely and painstakingly takes care of three children in the rear and struggles with life because she does not want to hinder the work of her husband Wu Guoqiang, who is fighting on the front line. She believes that the husband who combined in love is always faithful to her and spends all day painstakingly waiting for the reunion after victory. However, the fact did not make her wish come true because of her perseverance, and the tragedy began here. The news that Guoqiang was living with a dancer on the front line forced her to rush to the front line, and the good dreams she had on the way were ruthlessly shattered by the facts. Manyin was abandoned! And very tragically. Guoqiang gave her endless mental harm and oppression. For the sake of "face," he resolutely refused Manyin's last request in painful despair, "divorce." He not only wanted Manyin to maintain a superficial husband and wife relationship but also used force to prevent her from approaching any man. Manyin's self-esteem prompted her to strive for a new life. She demanded freedom, independence, and a happy life. Although her feet were tied by her children, she struggled to enter "Accounting School" because the prerequisite for economic independence is the enrichment of knowledge. Mr. Yin, who taught accounting, a young man in his twenties with good knowledge and character, was initially concerned about Manyin, and then expressed his love in a letter and wanted to be Manyin's younger brother. However, Guoqiang did not go through the divorce procedures with her, and society did not give her the right to freedom. Women who have been suppressed by traditional forces for thousands of years dare not and cannot accept new love even if they struggle in a desperate and bitter life. Moreover, Manyin's perseverance was still humiliated by Guoqiang, and she almost lost her life under Guoqiang's gun. Because of Guoqiang's repeated oppression, because of Guoqiang's excessive cold and indifference, Manyin, this abandoned and stubborn woman, resolutely published a separate announcement stating that she was officially divorced from Wu Guoqiang, and led her children to a new road extending in front of her for her own freedom. For her safety, for Yin's future happiness, and for Manyin's love for Yin, she endured all the grief and quietly left, and struggled with life alone.</p>
<p>Indeed, Manyin is just one of the unfortunate women with a fighting spirit. At the same time and in the same space, I really don't know how many thousands of women are enduring the same suffering, no, enduring suffering even greater than Manyin's.</p>
<p>This is a problem, a serious social problem belonging to the happiness of all mankind. Mr. Bingxin has more concretely analyzed it in front of us.</p>
<p>Undeniably, this is still a deformed society, a male-centered society. Although the calls for "anti-feudalism" and "anti-ethics" have long been regarded as old historical relics by those who call themselves progressive, the ethics that grew out of feudal society are still ruthlessly "eating people," but they are eating more civilized and cleverly.</p>
<p>If there is still something truly fair and universal in the world, it is sunshine and emotion. Whether it is a giant merchant with billions of wealth or a penniless beggar, they are all illuminated by the sun in the same way. Emotion is also like this, it will never have any snobbery or class distinction, anyone has his or her true emotions, and the reason why they are expressed differently is naturally the effect of the various creeds bound by this civilized society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the same objective environment, one scale is used to measure men, and another scale from the hands of men is used to measure women.</p>
<p>Therefore, the inner contradictions and pain suffered by Manyin are even deeper. She still cannot transcend the world, and like a criminal, she does not even have the courage to read a "love letter." After being abandoned, she still remembers her wife's natural talent fixed by "traditional forces," and sadly and fearfully speaks to her husband's photo.</p>
<p>"Isn't Guoqiang standing on the wall? He is staring at me angrily, as if he wants to swallow me in one bite. I am afraid, I tremble..."</p>
<p>In the end, she didn't dare to accept true love.</p>
<p>But history is always moving forward, and the footsteps of mankind are always moving towards the light. There is no eternal night of darkness, and naturally there will be no muddy path that cannot be walked to the end.</p>
<p>As Mr. Bingxin pointed out in the end, the warning to all women shouted by Manyin's pen:</p>
<p>"I understand that a woman's reason must overcome emotion so that she will not be a prisoner of love; a woman must have thought and be able to be economically independent so that she will not be oppressed by men; she should always think of a road that she must take, not relying on others, but taking it with my own strength!"</p>
<p>Look at your own health! In one's life, only pain and suffering are truly real, and everything else is just illusion.</p>
<p>But, because only pain and suffering are truly real, we redouble our efforts to train ourselves so that we have more perseverance to trek the road ahead that is full of suffering.</p>
<p>"What is placed in front is a new road, whether it is a flat road or a small road full of thorns, I must boldly and bravely go..."</p>
<p>Yes, you must boldly and bravely go!</p>
<p>Rely on yourself! Rely on your own beliefs and efforts, and the road will always be walked out.</p>
<p>May thousands of unfortunate women get endless deep sympathy and the perseverance to fight hard under Mr. Bingxin's pen!</p>
<p>Bless the unfortunate women,</p>
<p>Bless the unfortunate mankind!</p>

<h3>Talking about Faith</h3>
<p>— Wujiu</p>
<p>"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." What is "death of the heart"? It is losing the courage to struggle, that is, losing faith in one's own goals.</p>
<p>Individuals who have lost self-confidence generally exhibit two major types of behavior: one is utter defeatism, shrinking back everywhere, and always feeling that others are bullying them; those who sigh "nine out of ten people are worthy of contempt, and a hundred uses are not as good as a scholar" belong to this category; the other is manifested in the sadistic tendencies of tyrannical and arbitrary behavior—using violence against the weak to cover up their own hesitation and wandering. Take the Japanese soldiers as an example. When defeats were frequently reported, they were particularly suspicious and cruel to the people in the occupied areas, which is a clear example.</p>
<p>Last winter, the author talked with an old American judge who had lived in China for a long time about China's future. The old judge said with emotion: "I don't think there is anything particularly sad or worrying. The United States also went through the Civil War, and the result was that after the war ended, the United States was still the United States!"</p>
<p>Recently, seeing the various measures taken by the British government made people feel even more ashamed. In this war, the British Empire can be said to have lost all its colonies in one fell swoop, and the people are suffering from widespread poverty and hunger, but the government has always been unwavering, honoring the principle of "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," and leading the indomitable British people forward step by step. The food ration has been reduced repeatedly, and Cripps, the executor of economic policies, called on the people of the whole country, saying: "The output of various basic industries in Britain has created new records. Britain has passed the most dangerous stage, and the time of prosperity after adversity is coming."</p>
<p>If we now urgently need to be self-reliant, then Britain is really a good model. We must trust ourselves in order to truly control our own destiny. As long as we can use facts to show that we are truly willing to help ourselves, we will never be alone.</p>

<h3>Dream Roaming</h3>
<p>— Nong Ni</p>
<p>Since last autumn, Mr. Yu has written to me inviting me to take a short trip to West Lake at least five or six times. However, due to my lack of leisurely days and grand feelings, I have been too lazy to go out, constantly delaying it. I don't know when I can finally settle this green dust.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't have a love for lakes and mountains. On the contrary, Mr. Yu's invitations have added so many dreams to me. I only feel that although I am separated from West Lake, West Lake is not separated from me. During my reclining travel, I silently memorized:</p>
<p>"West Lake is always present in my ignorance, and the West Lake in my dreams has never left me for a day."</p>
<p>Not only that, but sometimes I have the right to sing aloud or softly:</p>
<p>"What I have in my dreams, does West Lake lack?"</p>
<p>Who says Leifeng Pagoda is a collapsed relic? I believe it is complete as ever in my dreams, without the need for reconstruction. Even though winter is not yet deep, I have seen "Broken Bridge Remaining Snow" in my dreams. "Orioles Singing in the Willows," "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," etc... As for now, these seem to be out-of-season beautiful scenes, but in my dreams, they are still clearly audible, illuminated by bright sunshine. Yes, the West Lake in dreams is truly, let me tell you: it appears the most complete, the most vivid, the most magnificent, and the most beautiful.</p>
<p>Childhood has long gone far away, left behind me. However, the imprints left on the lakes and mountains during childhood should never be erased, right? The warm invitations from friends over the past year must also be deeply engraved, right?</p>
<p>Then, why don't I continue reclining travel? I might as well hum: "From now on, I will only seek solitude in the Butterfly Hermitage, lying comfortably on my beautiful couch, cherishing my old dreams: a scene of West Lake, still perfectly motionless."</p>
<p>However, with the country in turmoil, is West Lake truly motionless? I write this "Dream Roaming" to repay Mr. Yu, hoping he can tell me new news.</p>
<h3>Talking About Snakes</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>Biologists tell us that snakes have no ears. So, how do they detect the movements and dangers around them?</p>
<p>We often see a snake, when it stops moving, immediately sticking out two thread-like whiskers from its mouth, about three inches long. They extend and retract, retract and extend, constantly moving in three directions in front of the snake's head - left, right, and straight ahead. When it resumes moving forward, these two thread-like whiskers are hidden in its mouth, and cannot be seen. At the same time, when it is pursued and feels threatened and panicked, these two thread-like whiskers contract and extend more frequently, and the movements are faster, seemingly playing a very important role.</p>
<p>According to the research results of biologists, these thread-like whiskers are the snake's tongue. When it is still or in panic, it constantly contracts and extends to probe. This is using the tongue as ears because there are many sensitive nerve endings on their tongue. These small protrusions can detect sound waves and all other vibrations in the surroundings, thereby knowing the actual situation and finding a relatively safe direction to escape.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>The latest trick of American magicians is using a "guillotine." The magician asks his assistant to lie under the knife, and with a "bang," the shiny blade of the guillotine comes down on his neck—of course, this knife will not really cut off his "head," but it looks very realistic. Even a cob of corn placed under the assistant's chin is cut into two pieces.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a psychology professor at Harvard University conducted a test. A total of 1,484 people were tested. The professor played two recordings of a certain symphony to them and asked them to judge which one was better. He also explained that critics generally felt that the second recording was better. As a result, 59 percent of the people felt that the second recording was indeed better—only 4 percent of the people told the truth: the two recordings were actually exactly the same.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Studio with Mice - Prince Chun's Illness and Death</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>According to Huang Ren's research: Empress Dowager Cixi was born in Ya'an (formerly belonging to Sichuan, now belonging to Xikang). Therefore, she possessed the wild nature of the southwest border area, which is similar to Wu Zetian, who was born in Guangyuan, Sichuan. This old woman intervened in state affairs for as long as 47 years during the late Qing Dynasty, and her influence on the changes in Chinese history cannot be said to be insignificant. However, to this day, no one has written a fair and complete critical biography for her, which is also a dereliction of duty by historians of this era.</p>
<p>If you want to write about Empress Dowager Cixi, you must not forget that there is also a small, upright but weak figure who attached himself to the hem of this old woman's skirt and completed his life. This is the so-called Prince Chun Yixuan.</p>
<p>Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty had nine sons, and he passed the throne to his fourth son, Yizhu, who was Emperor Xianfeng. After Xianfeng ascended the throne, among his surviving brothers, there were only the fifth brother, Yicong (Prince Dun), the sixth brother, Yixin (Prince Gong), and the seventh brother, Yixuan (Prince Chun). These three people had different personalities, and none of them were liked by Xianfeng. Prince Dun was impulsive and had no interest in politics. His life was completely that of a flag bearer without progress. Prince Gong was more clever and profound, had political ambitions, and loved wealth. Prince Chun was honest and emotional, with a "semi-hysterical" personality. Compared to his brothers, he had the most humanity. Therefore, when Empress Dowager Cixi adopted his son Zaitian (Emperor Guangxu) as emperor, he knelt down, kowtowed, and cried bitterly. This was not necessarily a pretense, but truly the love of a father for his son that could not be severed.</p>
<p>After Empress Dowager Cixi took power, due to conflicts of interest, she hated Prince Gong the most. However, she treated Prince Chun's wife as her own sister and had a special personal relationship with her. She always wanted to elevate Prince Chun to belittle Prince Gong. Obviously, after Emperor Tongzhi died and Emperor Guangxu ascended the throne, Prince Chun was quite afraid of things and did not dare to come forward, and he was also short of talent and strategy, so he could not exert himself in politics. In the tenth year of Guangxu, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered Prince Gong to withdraw from the Grand Council, and all his party members, Bin Jun and Li Hongzao, were expelled. She separately instructed the Grand Council that when encountering major events, they should first consult with Prince Chun, directly entrusting Prince Chun with the duties of Prince Gong. However, in the following years, until his death in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, he was never able to accomplish anything. The only things that could be勉强commended were "encouraging naval construction" and "supporting Zuo Zongtang in personnel matters."</p>
<p>Although Empress Dowager Cixi initially liked Prince Chun, after discovering that Emperor Guangxu had different ideas from her, she began to hate Prince Chun because of Guangxu. Thus, Prince Chun gradually became known for his illness. This old man's illness and death became a mystery in the political history of the late Qing Dynasty. My late grandfather, Mr. Ming San, was skilled in medical theory. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu, after he was relieved of his duties in Hubei, he was in Nanjing. He received a telegram from Li Hongzhang in Tianjin, summoning him to Beijing to examine Prince Chun's illness. Upon arriving, he stayed at Prince Chun's residence and tried to verify the prescriptions of the Imperial Hospital, but he was confused and did not know what to do. One day, as he was taking the pulse, Emperor Guangxu suddenly arrived with Empress Dowager Cixi. After the Empress Dowager asked my grandfather's name, she said, "Dr. Zhang's prescription should be sent to the former physicians of the Imperial Household Department for review." My grandfather understood the meaning, and the next day, he excused himself with illness and resigned. Passing through Tianjin, he visited Li Hongzhang and said, "The prescription of the Imperial Hospital is not compatible with Prince Chun's illness, what should be done!" Li Hongzhang was dismayed. However, Prince Chun's illness recovered that year, and he did not die until three years later. Weng Tonghe's diary on November 21st of the sixteenth year of Guangxu states: "Hearing of Prince Chun's death, I rushed in to pay my respects. The Emperor wailed loudly, and the ministers also burst into tears. I faced the mourning clothes for four hours, and revised the draft of the Ministry of Rites twelve times with Laishan, and then finalized the purchase."</p>
<h3>Starting from Foot Binding</h3>
<p>— Feng Yunzhuang</p>
<p>Today, the issue of women seems to be conceived and raised by men. For thousands of years, women themselves have become accustomed to the so-called female virtue of "following is right". Therefore, when men wanted them to bind their feet, they bound their feet. Now that men want them to use their brains to think about women's issues, they are of course still "not disobeying their husbands".</p>
<p>Why do men think of women's issues? Because they first thought of "social issues." They thought that the whole society needs to be rationalized, and the whole of mankind should be "equal" and "free." Thank them for not forgetting that women are also human, so they advocate that women should stand up and fight for freedom and equality. In other words, women should be liberated.</p>
<p>If every man believes that women should be free, equal, and liberated, then the issue of women will no longer be an issue. The problem lies in the old system, old concepts, and old habits that cannot be completely reformed or broken. Therefore, some believe that they should fight for it, and some believe that they should not fight for it and should be maintained. As for what women themselves really think? I think most uneducated or undereducated women probably have only one thought, that is, how to marry a husband, and a good husband, then all women's problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Even educated women may not necessarily think otherwise, but they may not dare to say it out loud because the idea of ​​relying on a husband is outdated, and they want to become modern. So, upper-class concubines consider themselves happy. The issue of women simply does not arise in them. Moreover, it would be worse for them if the issue of women were resolved. Ask who would be willing to get up in the cold morning, leave the Simmons bed, and work hard to seek independence?</p>
<p>Even other kinds of educated women are relatively happy. At least they already have the opportunity to seek knowledge. That is to say, their parents are relatively wealthy and open-minded. They are never subjected to very serious oppression. The truly oppressed women, like the truly oppressed poor people, only hope to survive. How can they think about whether it is an issue or not, what is called freedom, equality, independence, liberation, etc.?</p>
<p>Therefore, this issue of women, like other social issues, is raised on behalf of people who are not very in need of a solution by those who think they are very in need of a solution. Do women who are considered should-be-needy really need to solve the problem? At least based on the current phenomena, there are only a few types of women who talk about this issue themselves: first, modern women who blindly follow men's opinions; second, middle-aged women who have suffered marital pain or have lost their spouses; third, educated women who have no life experience and only love to be unconventional; fourth, female scholars who specialize in studying social issues, etc. In short, the women who talk about women's issues are only a part of the whole, and among these people, those who truly have free, equal, independent, and liberated thoughts and actions are even less than one in a hundred.</p>
<p>This is why the "issue of women" remains an issue.</p>

<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter One: Joyfully Meeting a Soulmate (4)</p>
<p>Around 7:30 in the evening, Zhu Zhai took a rickshaw to the radio station. As the rickshaw passed through the Three Arches Gate, in the dim twilight, a tricycle suddenly caught up from behind, with two bright headlights on. The female passenger on the tricycle raised her hand to Zhu Zhai and said, "Are you Mr. Xu? My house is number twelve." As she spoke, the tricycle sped forward. In a hurry, Zhu Zhai felt that the person speaking to him seemed to be Qi Wan, but unfortunately he didn't have time to reply, and his rickshaw had already sped away. After arriving at the radio station, he sang a section of "Yu Tang Chun" in the broadcast room. It wasn't until 8:30 after he finished singing. Thinking that it was still early, he thought it would be better to visit Qi Wan's house. She must have listened to the broadcast tonight and asked her how he sang. They could study and research together and see if her impression of him was not bad.</p>
<p>Thinking this, he left the radio station and hired a rickshaw straight to the Second Alley of the School Field. At this time, the sky was very dark, and there were no street lights in the alley. After Zhu Zhai got out of the rickshaw, he checked several houses, but they were all wrong. Finally, at a small door on the east side, there was a child standing. Zhu Zhai asked him, "Little brother, let me ask you, where is number twelve?" The child said, "I don't know." Zhu Zhai said, "Is there anyone named Gu here?" The child said, "Isn't that the Gu family across the street?" Zhu Zhai hurriedly walked to the opposite door and saw that the words "Gu Residence" seemed to be vaguely written on the doorpost. In the darkness, he couldn't see clearly. He gently knocked on the door, and a servant came out. Zhu Zhai told him that he wanted to see Boss Gu Qi Wan. The servant said, "This is the residence of Boss Gu Da. Boss Gu Qi Wan lives across the street." As he spoke, he slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai returned to the opposite side, but the child was gone. At this time, he felt a little anxious. Regardless of whether it was Qi Wan's residence or not, he knocked on the door several times in a row. An old woman opened the door from inside. Zhu Zhai said that he was looking for Gu Qi Wan. The old woman turned around and went inside, shouting, "Boss Gu, someone is looking for you." Immediately, a young lady walked out from inside. As soon as Zhu Zhai saw her, she was the one he had seen in the park in the morning. The young lady looked at Zhu Zhai carefully and asked him, "What is your surname?" Zhu Zhai said, "My surname is Xu. Is Boss Gu at home?" The young lady said, "Boss Gu is not at home." Upon hearing this, Zhu Zhai was very disappointed, thinking to himself that Qi Wan was not at home, and he had come for nothing. Standing at the door, he hesitated. The young lady said again, "Boss Gu has a phone call saying: when a Mr. Xu comes, please ask him to sit inside. Boss Gu will be back in a while." Upon hearing this, Zhu Zhai felt as if he had been given a stimulant injection and immediately became excited again. Following the young lady, he said, "My surname is Xu, my surname is Xu!" The young lady smiled and led him inside. Zhu Zhai looked around, and the courtyard was a quadrangle house. There were no lights in the east and west rooms. Although there were lights in the south room, they were covered by curtains, giving off a dim light. Only the north room had electric lights, which were brightly lit. The young lady opened the door curtain and let Zhu Zhai in. He looked around and saw that the two rooms of the main room were connected, arranged as a small living room, with several sofas, a bookshelf, and a desk. The arrangement was very simple. The young lady brought tea and looked at Zhu Zhai a few times, then went inside again. After a while, she brought out cigarettes and handed one to Zhu Zhai. Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I don't smoke." The young lady smiled and stood aside. Zhu Zhai looked at her carefully. She had an oval face, curved eyebrows, and a small mouth. Her facial features were very well-proportioned. Her face was not made up, and she had naturally fair skin. He felt that such a sweet and pretty young lady was rare in the north.</p>
<h3>Viewpoint</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to visit Old Li, whom I hadn't seen for a long time. Old Li wasn't home yet, so I chatted with Old Li's wife.</p>
<p>The topic changed from the weather to the new clothes of the ladies. Mrs. Li laughed and asked me, "Did you see that velvet jacket on the sofa? Ah, you men's tempers are really strange!"</p>
<p>Of course, I quickly asked what relationship the velvet shirt had with men's tempers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li found it more and more funny. She said, "Two weeks ago, I went to see a night show with our Mr. Li. The weather was strangely cool, so we slowly walked home. Just as we were walking across a quiet road, I saw a young man under the street lamp who kept looking at my new velvet jacket—Mr. Li seemed to have noticed it too. That night, I had a big red flower in my hair, which went well with this light blue shirt, so it was really a bit eye-catching, wasn't it? Unexpectedly, that ignorant big kid actually walked up and tugged on Mr. Li's sleeve, saying that he wanted to borrow a light to smoke. Mr. Li really lost his temper. He pushed the person away and picked up a brick, and with a bang, he knocked the person unconscious!"</p>
<p>I said, "Old Li's jealousy is really powerful! Did he drink too much?"</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders: "Old Li hasn't been drinking for a long time. Mr. Zhou, don't be angry, but I think you men's tempers are really strange."</p>
<p>After waiting for a long time, Old Li didn't come, so I said goodbye. Just as I walked to the corner of the road, I bumped into Old Li.</p>
<p>"Hey, Old Li, why do you like to hit people with bricks lately?"</p>
<p>He laughed loudly. "You must have met my wife. It was really lucky to find that brick on the road that day! Think about it, I had more than two million in cash with me that night, which is still a small matter. Look at the Elgin gold watch on my arm, 18k, which I brought back from the United States myself last year. My wife was also wearing a three-carat diamond ring!"</p>
<p>"In that case, that guy had bad intentions and wanted to rob something."</p>
<p>"Of course! Think about it, in the middle of the night, that road is so remote, and suddenly a person jumps out and grabs your arm and asks you for matches. What good intentions would he have!"</p>
<p>I felt that his words made some sense, so we parted…</p>
<p>"Old Zhou, don't run!" Suddenly someone behind me called me. Looking back, it was my old classmate Xiao Wang, whom I hadn't seen for more than half a month.</p>
<p>"Oh, Xiao Wang, why is your head beaten up like this! I told you a long time ago: when you reach our age, you should be content and enjoy your life at home. But you just love to play soccer. This time you must have lost the game and got beaten up again, right?"</p>
<p>Xiao Wang glared at me and said, "I went to drink."</p>
<p>In the hotel, Xiao Wang sighed and said, "Speaking of this matter, it is also related to you, old friend. Half a month ago, I came out of a relative's house after drinking wedding wine. I looked at the high sky and the bright moon hanging high in the sky. It was very interesting, and I was a little reluctant to go home to sleep. When I got into a good mood, I thought you were a person who worked late at night. Why not go to the newspaper office to talk to you. I wanted to smoke along the way, but I just forgot my lighter at home. Just as I was helpless, I suddenly saw a well-dressed man with an extremely ugly and vulgar woman swaying and coming. That man was also holding a cigarette in his mouth. I went forward and politely asked him for a match. Unexpectedly, that guy suddenly had a mental breakdown and picked up a brick and hit me on the head!"</p>
<p>He drank a cup in one gulp, shook his head and said, "I also blame myself for being too careless. That place turned out to be in front of an insane asylum. This couple is undoubtedly a madman who just escaped from the insane asylum!"</p>
<p>Back in the newspaper office, I immediately looked for the old newspaper from half a month ago. There was a short message in the local news: "Yesterday morning, a drunken young man lost his footing and fell at the corner of XX Road, and his head was injured by touching a brick on the side of the road. He was helped up by the police, and the young man hired a car to return home for treatment. It is heard that the police found from the young man's identity card that the young man is the son of a certain important person. His parents are extremely doting and let him indulge in opium, which led to this accident."</p>
