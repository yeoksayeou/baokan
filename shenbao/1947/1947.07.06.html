<h3>張羣闡明動員意義　集中力量從事建設　邀有關首長商實施辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國務會議四日通過之總動員案，五日上午九時業送達政院，此爲國務會議決義案送達政院罕有之迅速。政院院長張羣，五日下午四時至七時在政院召集有關部會首長，對該方案實施辦法作初步商討，各部會首長對主管部門業務亦正在擬訂草案中，可能於八日政務會計論，首都政治空氣自動員方案公表後，顯已自沉悶中轉到明期。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕行政院院長張羣，五日爲國府總動員令即將付諸實施，發表談話，原詞如次：</p>
<p>本院昨日奉國民政府厲行國家總動員，掃除民主障礙，貫澈和平建國方針的訓令，即將付之實施，這是政府爲加强建國進程而採取的重大措施，國家今天所以不得不動員戡亂的理由，業已詳見主席提案的全文中。在執行之初，本人願再行閘述其意義，並將今後全國人民與各級官吏將士應有的認識和努力加以說明，用資策勵。</p>
<p>中國本來是一個貧弱的國家，八年對日抗戰的結果，國家元氣愈形凋殘，人民生活愈形困苦，方期勝利之後迅速從事建設，使政治民主化，經濟工業化，不幸在抗戰期間，中國共黨乘國家之難，蓄積實力，勝利之後，便成爲國家建設的內在障礙，政府與中共的和平商談，政協會議的召集以及美國友邦馬啟爾將軍，司徒大使等不斷的努力調停，都不能挽回共產黨以暴力奪取政權的野心，到政府改組以後，本人對於中共問題仍表示希望以有效的軍事措施，迅速達成用政治方法解決國內糾紛，恢復統一的目的，不幸兩個多月以來，共黨氣燄更爲最張，叛亂愈形擴大，並再度拒絕了國民參政會恢復和談的議案，以上事實，都爲國人所共見共聞。</p>
<p>迴想抗戰勝利之後，政府方汲汲努力從事軍隊的整編，流亡的安輯，民主憲政的凖備，人民自由田權利的保障以及經濟的復員建設，但共匪則背道而馳，盡力擴充軍隊，擴大叛亂，對於公私財產的破壞，人民生命自由的找賊，無所不用其極，是政府　積寸累的建設，不能當共匪窮兇極惡的破壞，似此兇燄日張，暴行日烈，如果不迅速予以戡平，國家民族必歸於毀滅，政府因此，，不得不本　人憂國之心，毅然行弔民救國之事。</p>
<p>總動員的意義，是集中全國的意志與力量，一方面掃除建國的障碍，一方面提高全民的警覺性，儘力量之所及，儘事勢之可能，從事於政治與經濟的建設工作，於此，全國人民必須有一個根本認識，須知這是中國建設力量與破壞力量之爭，是民主勢力與反民主勢力之爭，是中國主奴盛衰的國運關錢所在，中國建設還須要再經過這一個階段，自非初意所能料想，但事勢旣已無從避兔，我們必須集全國之力，來突破這一道難關。我們是以戡亂求統一，以苦幹謀復興，我們的意志愈堅韌，力量集中，這一段艱苦的過程愈可以縮短。</p>
<p>因爲總動員的意義不止是消極的戡亂，而尤其是積極的建設，政府現正進行憲政準備工作，實施期間已不在遠，爲了培養憲政的精神。對於人民基本權利的保障，仍然要特別注意，但人民的權利以國家的安定統一爲基礎，現在國家正在爭取安定統一之時，全國人民必須置國家民族的利益於個人利益之上，在政府應該　儘量尊重人民的自由權利，人民也應該尊重法律，愛護秩序，加强對於國家的責任感，必須如此，眼前才可以迅速恢復安定統一的局面，在將來也便是民主憲政的眞實根基。從政府人員的立塲說；在總動員時期，政府人員的事務加緊，責任加重，因此，必須先求自己本身的健全：才能迅速有效發動人民的力量，於此我們便不得不加緊汪意政治的運用和政治的屬紀。</p>
<p>在政治運用上，必先注意到縱貫橫聯關係的緊凑靈活，縱的方面，務必要使每一件法令從上級一直貫澈到基層，不延宕，不變質，不敷衍。橫的方面，機關與機關中甲部門與乙部門之問，應該協力合作，責任分明，旣不越權，也無推諉，而政府官官官吏對於人民尤其應該建立信用，取得人民的合作，如此能才使每一法令都能實施到普遍貫澈，適合國家的要求，在政治氣風紀上必須根絕貪污，確立明法守法的精神，動員時期，政治控制的力量，更爲普遍深入，倘如執行人員的操守稍不謹嚴，便足以妨害政令的推行，敗壞政府的聲譽，引起人民的反惑，因此，政府人員與國軍將士規律自己，督率部屬，必須特別謹嚴，如果有利用職位，營私舞弊，或濫用權力，任意連法，侵害人民權利，或規避責任，諱亂縱匪，一俟查覺，必當嚴厲懲罰，絕無寬貸，尤其希望全國人民，對於貧污，舞弊擾民·縱匪的官史，將士，盡量舉，以輔政府監察力量之所不及，確實收到整節政風軍紀的成效。檢討中國國民革命的歷史。五十多年來，中國雖然受到許多內憂外患，但建國的進程，始終不會退轉，向上的中華民族，其復興事，不是任何反動力量所能阻撓，政府旣已下了以戡亂求統一，以苦幹謀復興的決心，望全國同胞，擁護政府的國策，拿出一切的力量，共同奮鬥。</p>
<h3>經濟配合總動員　全經委會正作各種準備　設立金融公司原則決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕總動員案通過後，全國經委會正積極作各種必要準備，期與該案相配合。又經濱改革方案，經該委會全體會及小組會審查後，即可全部審查竣事，下週四大會司望提出計論。又該委會小組會五日十時曾審查國營事業出售監理會組織條例草案，並予通過，翁文　召集之工業組定下週一十開會。金融小組四日開會時，對中國復興金融公司設立原則，會作決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕關於徵糧如何與總動員案配合事，俟政院令到，糧部即開始籌劃。至於本年度徵糧總額，政院已令糧部再擬，俾能配合當前請要。〔請參閱第六版〕</p>
<h3>并西北鍊鋼廠　鋼鐵大量輪滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原五日電〕西北鍊鋼廠排除萬難，刻日產生鐵五十噸，鋼六十噸，焦炭一百五十噸，鍋料四十噸，其他副產品油，瀝靑，洋樟腦數十噸，自此間空運加强後，該廠利用回程機，大量向滬輸出生鐵與鋼料、現儲生鐵五千餘噸，鋼料中有圖鋼三角鋼等亟待輸出。據梁海橋廠長語記者，因資金缺乏，週轉欠靈，亟盼中央予以有效支援</p>
<h3>四中全會　定九月舉行</h3>
<p>中央將設靑年部</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕聞中央黨部將設一靑年部，部長人選以鄭彥菜呼聲爲最高，蔣經國可能出任副部長，此事四中全會九月開會時可望決定。</p>
<h3>桂永清返京</h3>
<p>短期內將赴華北一行　〔本報南京五日電〕桂永淸五日自浙江海面趕返首都。挂氏原擬赴厦門海軍基地檢閱，短期內無返京意，此次突然趕返與一厲行總動員」案有關。挂氏返京後，即謁軍事當局，有所請示。聞短期內或將赴華北一行。</p>

政府爲維護國脈民命，當機立斷，阻過亂萌，更屬實無旁貸。　　如上所述，我們已能明瞭促成經濟危機並非由於政府的戡亂，同時我們能認識促使經濟崩潰，乃是中共的毒辣企圖，也是中共的目的。於此，我們試加瞑目沉思，如果中共以拙毁中國經濟促使崩潰爲第一個目標，以奪取政權爲第二個目標，均能如願，那末，中國四億五千萬同胞的生活將陷於何種境地？不難想見的，將是一幅萬刦不復的大流民圖！我們相信，只有不愛國家的野心家，才有勇氣造成這幅大流民圖的。　　上海是全國經濟的中心，所以我們主張迅以快刀斬亂蔴的乎段，消滅若干助長經濟危機的因素，以期克服危機。造成經濟危機促使經濟崩潰的中共，就是始作俑者！希望大家認淸責任，協助政府撲滅亂前，切勿囿於一時對於現狀不滿的情感衝動，徒知結怨政府，指摘政府，反隋中共的發中，結果惟有危機愈深，社會秩序愈益不寗而已。　　目前足以助長經濟危機的因素，我們認爲最主要的還是外幣黑市的存在和猖獗。也可以說，過去金鈔風潮領導物價高漲的事實，雖經政府公布緊急措施辦法予以取締，可是，時隔不久，業已死灰復燃，抑且變本加厲。根據我們所知，最近美鈔與外匯的黑市交易，數量頗大，幾已成爲秘密公開！因爲比價日高，又起領導物似上漲的作用了。經營者除了若干市儈奸商外，尤以猶太人集團爲多數。而更可注意者，買進美鈔和外匯的，中共分子竟爲大主顧。他們在戰爭中攘奪人民的財物，作爲購買美鈔外匯的資本；以買進的美鈔外匯，作爲向某方換取軍火的資本；某方以軍火換來的美鈔外匯，更作爲赤化世界的資本。有了這樣的大背景，所以不計重價吸收。惟利是圖的奸商市儈，乃竟不惜推波助瀾，抬價競售，追求暴利，其罪直與危害民國的共黨匪徒無殊。我們希望中央乃至地方當局密切注視這問題的嚴重性。我們還記得今春金鈔風潮中，上海曾有經濟監察團之組織，中樞並派大員蒞滬嚴密偵緝，一時大有風行草偃之勢，而黑市交易也就斂跡一時。嗣後時過境遷，偵緝稍　弛，同時曾經破案的洋老虎懲治過輕，迄今尙在上訴，土老虎某銀行董事，雖證據確　，也竟未懲辦，狐埋狐猾，政府自　威信，於是無形中予若輩奸儈以大胆嘗試之機會，致有最近黑市猖獗之重演。爲懲前毖後計，我們主張偵緝工作確有加强必要，務使美鈔外匯之黑市，澈底消滅，不使流入中共之手，爲作亂資本，更不使起領導物價上漲作用，重苦小民。　　最近市塲有所謂「七月漲風」的謠傳，當局已經密切注意，並加强經濟監察工作，這固是必要的措置。警局兪副局長對各報記者表示，對經監執行工作有「旣撲蒼蠅亦打老虎」的決心，我們深加慶幸。取締金鈔黑市，拆除對講電話以外，我們還希望採取有效辦法，首先監視猶太集團。尤其要注意「治亂世，用重典」，「一路哭，不如一家哭」。對於只知追求一已暴利，罔顧國家民族利益，擾亂經濟金融物價的奸儈之徒，絕不能姑息縱容，更不能任其流爲中共作亂的資本。希望政府進一步出之行動，嚴厲消滅黃金外幣的墨市，粉碎「七月漲風」的謠傳，毋使星星之火，又成燎原之勢！日首批賠償物資儘量配供民營　賠償委會負責人談話　　〔本報南京五日電〕賠償委會負責人頃發表民營事業申請價配日本賠償物資辦法，（全文見一一日本報），並就民營部份價配數額問题，發表談話稱：日賠償物資，係以儘量配供民營爲原則之一，首批拆遷物資，旨在拆毁日軍需工業，大部份爲重工業設備，現我預定可能獲得物資內，几可能者，即儘量配於民營，並經經濟部擬定採取聯營制，於迅速和用中，兼顧國家經濟建設，以後各批物資，亦由有關各万詳愼計劃，分別準備交涉中。發言人對於物資內可供民營部份，先行價配使用，而不能採取直接賠償各地公私損失之方法，亦有所說明稱·以此物資，直接撥付賠償人民之用，必零星而不能利用，同時直接撥作賠償，事實上無法分配，禁於上因故採價配辦法。新任監院副院長　黃紹竑正式就職　　〔中央社南京五日電〕新任監察院副院長黄紹紘，五日晨九時到院正式就職，于院長右任特召集監察院各級人員訓話，對黄氏參加革命及歷年來對國家之貢獻，詳爲介紹。孔祥熙飛抵林　轉赴故鄉掃墓　　〔中央社太原五日電〕中委孔祥熙，五日上午十時卅分由平飛抵幷，下午一時十分即搭專車南下赴其故鄉太谷掃墓。緬逮捕我逃兵　我止要求釋放　　〔路透社仰光五日電〕緬甸警察所逮捕之緬北中國遠征軍逃兵，爲數約二百名，係根據緬甸防衛法而予逮捕，官方拒絕說明彼等之確切罪狀，其中數人被捕已有數月之久，仰光中國總領事正交涉要求釋放中。政院救濟粵消災　撥現欵五億糧食千噸　另撥欵十億救濟魯災　　〔本報南京五日電〕政院頃撥現款五億元，糧食一千噸，救濟粤災。對魯災政院亦撥出脹款十億元。　　〔中央社廣州五日電〕陳納德將軍於昨自滬抵穗後，即與有關方而商討救濟粤省水災之祥細辦法，今晨會分別拜會行轅鄧副主任，羅主席，歐陽市長等，對如何協助救災，有詳細之討論。陳氏自滬携來之水陸兩用飛機，已決定撥爲出發各江區散發救濟物資之交通工具，由女飛行員勃斯駕駛，此水陸兩用小飛機輕便迅速每日可分飛各區，分送食物，預計日內即可實行。　　〔中央社新加坡四日電〕華僑商會主席李光前，昨於招待廣東同鄉會主席連瀛洲時，曾討論華南水災情形，並已決定召集一委會，發起募捐運動，以拯救粤閩災胞。漢市積極防沉　防水牆已整理　　〔中央社漢口四日電〕長江水位逐漸增漲，省市當局開始積極防汎，漢市沿江防水牆已整理竣事，四日漢口水位爲三七二〇呎，按漢口上年最高水位爲四四三〇呎，廿年漢口大水災，最高水位爲五三六五呎。西康雨爲患　交通無形斷絕　　〔本報雅安四日電〕康省近一週來這雨爲患，各處山洪暴發，房屋牲畜冲毀甚多，所有秧苜及玉麥等農作物亦均大受其害。川康樂西等公路之路基及橋梁于涵洞冲毁亦多，各處交通業已無形斷絕，刻尙在陰雰大雨中。浙省公路局發生　重大舞弊嫌疑案　　工賑麵粉運滬圖售被扣　　〔中央社杭州五日電〕浙省公路局近又發生重大舞弊嫌疑案。緣行總浙江分署核發修築臨海公路之工賑麵粉三千數百包，公路局竟以其中之二千三百七十包自寗波用輪船私運至滬圖售，乃被聯總駐浙人員發覺，於四日報請聯總中國分署，就地扣留，並電由浙省府處理中。蘇省劃四防汛區　　〔本報鎭江五日電〕蘇省建設廳頃決定將全省劃爲四個防汛區，計江北運河區，揚子江區，江南海塘區，銅山區，定本月十日展開防汛工作。杭市米價下跌　門售議價减低　　〔本報杭州五日電〕杭市糧食公會以近來米價日有跌落，原定門售議價已嫌過高，經決議明起調整價格，增列五擋，較前價普跌二萬。浙巨匪鄭梅馨股　據點被水警攻克　　〔本報杭州五日電〕巨匪鄭梅馨股，最近於樂淸玉環洋面滋擾，頗爲猖獗，定海水警局特將新購之平江，鼎興，時通三艦，配備有力員警，前往進攻大靑山奸匪據點，當即攻克，殘匪向樂淸大山潰逃。台高雄軍械庫　爆炸損失不重　　李進德報吿出事詳情　　〔中央社台北四日電〕台灣供應局長李進德招待新聞界，報吿六月廿日下午二時卅分高雄軍械庫爆炸案詳情稱：「此不辛事件，計重傷軍械員二人，現在醫院療治，無生命危險，其餘輕傷士兵六人，救火隊員一人，均能照常工作。關於軍火損失，庫藏物品多壓降軍之殘餘彈藥，及「二二八」事變收繳之雜色刀槍彈藥等不能用之品物。至於起火原因，係因　雨綿綿，彈藥不無受潮，迨是日放晴，氣溫驟增，受潮彈藥發生氧化，因而爆炸延燒，致成不幸，現失職員兵正在聽候中央命令懲處，前傳係由廚房不愼而起，實屬不確」。要聞簡報　　靑島電　空軍參謀學校學員卅人三，由胡教育長國屛，美顧問巴柏爾少校等率領，四日由京抵靑，參觀海軍學校。　　本報北平電　女作家謝冰心，五日晨離平飛滬，候輸赴日。　　華盛頓電　英加美袖珍聖經公會四日決定，明年在中國分發聖經五十萬册。　　本市訊　國立交火敎授劉馥英女士，將參加浙省國大婦女代表競選。中荷民航談判進行中　我言即提出對案　中暹談判下週可開始　　〔本報南京五日電〕主持我與各國民航談判之交部凌士芬顧問，五日語記者：中荷兩國代表，近曾開會兩次，首次會議時，荷方提出草案，盼我研討；四日二次會時，我曾對草案之意見吿知荷方，雙方繼即交換意見。三次會定下　期一開會，我方對案屆時可望提出。在此談判中。我對南洋航綫頗重視，蓋我付大批僑胞居留諸地。關於中暹談判，暹代表下週抵京後即開始。中印談判俟印代表到達亦即舉行。各地通訊　　無錫　　西梁溪路豐年米行學徒賈新翠，三日上午九時，至市行弄福裕錢莊，將二百五十萬元支票兌現返行，行經竹塲巷坑弄口，突被　徒三人將款搶去。　　金山　　縣兵役協會一日成立，決議免　役申請手續決於七月十”終止，逾期作放棄論，本屆征兵兼施抽籤，互推，招募志願兵等方式。　　奉賢　　縣兵役協會三日開曾，決定本縣兵役徽募並施，聞本縣配額不及四百名。又通過安家費，每一赤貧應征壯丁，除中央撥補五萬元外，年撥食米六石，無家屬之志願兵，德名發二百萬元。　　閔行　　上海縣參議會呈內政部，睛轉飭滬市府恢復戰前行政，敎育，警察等各項貼補，頃奉部復，令由省市政府協議。　　崑山　　此間刑警隊，於三日下午，在東門街捕獲販賣毒品犯趙　生等四人，連同白粉等，　解縣府法辦。　　平湖　　崇　錢林鄉一帶，近發現一化緣和尙，每至一村，必詳詢交通情形，並在僻處攀登大樹，窺察地形，繪製地圖，形跡頗可疑，專署獲悉後，已電本縣注意。　　海寗　　三日下午二時，自桐鄉駛硤汽輪，行經沈亭地方，被持械匪徒七名洗刦，損失約千萬元以上，迄晚捕獲梅勁靑李專夫二名，抄　手槍及退伍證明文件贓鈔等。　　青浦　　練南鄉鄉長曹麟祥，及職員金友梅，陸金祥，因販毒案發潛逃，縣府已下令通糾。　　福州　　聯愈香港遣僑辦事處主任李坤寗，原定日內來榕，辦理緬甸華僑復員，不意李氏日前在港竟爲汽車輾斃，此間歸僑聞訊，成爲沮喪，遺送勢將遲延。　　正陽關　　安徽省公路局爲便利行旅，特於蚌埠阜陽間，每日上午七時對開班車一次，票價六萬元。　　江陰　　派報工會五日開成立會，蘇州無錫武進各縣工會均派員參加，選舉陸履　等十人爲理監事。</p>

<p>全經會委員建議設立　中國復興金融公司　供應生產建設所需資金　　〔聯合微信所南京五日電〕國家行局業務之專業化，在抗戰期中，四聯總處已經規定推行，四年以來，頗有成効。最近全國經委會，仍在審議中。至經濟改革方率中，已將公私銀行之專業範圍，重加劃分。關於工礦交通貸款，須由交通銀行專負其責。但經委會若干委員認爲建國時期，生產建設所需之資金過鉅，決非交行一行所能供應，故主張設立中國復興金融公司，以供實業界所需之長期資金。並利用社會游資，由中央銀行及所有商業銀行及信託與保險公司出資籌設，並拓收羣僑資本。其主要業務：（一）對廠商直接辦理投資及貸放。（二）代理廠商發行或投資瞪劵，並代向國外接洽長期投資與貸款。（三）受廠商委託代爲向國外訂購生產器材，並作信用担保人。（四）代付廠商外匯借款。（五）發行產業債劵。買方勇氣百倍　華股又如茶　市况愈好紛紛漲停　　華股昨以金融帮四明農民等，買胃殊健，助長買方勇氣，賡續向榮。一般存多，紛紛向各大銀行接洽放款，準備永紗增資，過程遂愈盤愈好。華豐新亞火柴中法商務永公水泥紛紛漲停，現永紗漲停甚早，遞永紗漲停後又有貼價成交，又呈如火如荼局面。環境旣已改觀，有利之揣測紛紜，終以俏利結局。　　晨初人心不定，良以國行差進頗巨，除華豐承前收之勢開高較多外，餘者熒辱不一。遞永紗開後，二二六號一八五號賣出，退至八七五〇元。現水紗達八五五〇元低價，五七號四明趁低力購，一四八號一六〇號二一八號二三五號六五號二二三號及金磁界一一〇號一四一號二三二號二〇七號亦進，而回升至九一五〇元。一四二號四號一九七號一五二號乘高尙售，降至九〇四〇元。三一號一四八號一五五號六五號四四號一一七號一五號五七號二二三號再進至九三二〇元。一八六號一四二號五四號一五三號五五號逢高仍有脫售，回降百餘元，一五八號力請現永紗，一一七號一八五破二三五號八號三號一四號紛購，即交永紗先由一〇四號掛高至漲停板。火柴由九九號掛伴，遞永紗升至九六〇〇元，而後稍盤。商務由二四號掛漲停，一五五號一四號二三〇號八五號二二六號一四二號二二四號一〇〇號二二三號紛納，遞永紗亦吿漲停矣。入後一三四號七七號一五四號來進，永公由二二六號掛高至漲停板，　永紗暗市升至九八〇〇元外。一四八號一四二號九四號二二三號一三三號二一八號之脫手，於十一時半後，曾破入九五五〇元以下。是時全塲除即交水紗仍站漲限外，餘都已退至漲限以下。八九號一六〇號二二四號一五五號一八八號再進，水泥由一七四號掛漲停，復回好至九八〇〇元。一六九號一八三號一五七號乘高再售，退至九七五〇元以下收市。收後喊價仍拉高至儿八〇〇元以上。結果較前收計即交股永紗華豐漲達限度，永公中法漲停後有回，漲起成半。信和漲一成，新光美亞新華各升半成强，景福微升，勤興平平，水泥火柴麗安新亞均吿漲停，商務灌停後有回，與榮豐同升半成强，大通中紡統益五和內衣均升一成左右，中絲景綸微升。遞交股計永紗華豐永公漲停，信和升一成弱，美亞新光各好半成强，景福雖漲而不多，塲外各老股計中華世界闡北華商微升，餘尙平定。　　新星藥廠昨開股東會，通過資本由四千萬元增爲十億元，每一老股贈送十四股，認九股，並發統債交易平淡　外股漲後有回　　公債昨轉穩健，統丙晨開六四〇〇元，自六三〇〇元步升至七六〇〇元，而後稍平。五〇三室買進，五三三室則出，成交一百萬左右。結果較前收計甲乙丁各漲八百元，統丁升五百元，統丙回好一千二。　　外股昨漲後有回，金號業有售，廣帮及證券帮有買。華商銀行搜買英聯怡紗，洋商出怡紗英聯而進紙業。怡紗最開八四〇〇無，先見八五〇〇〇元高價，而後回降至八二〇〇〇元低價結束。結果較前收計怡　航業電話墾植均平，怡紗微升，英聯會德豐業廣紙業各漲半成强，鋼業好起一成不到。貨主急求脫售　食米賡續下演　豆油人心虛軟價格步跌　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千三百餘石，川鄂皖贛均有到貨，雨季期內正値熟性之時，中次食米貨主急求脫售，店胃淸間，而公敎配米絡續，是以實銷甚懈，市况江河日下之勢。粳秈一致續跌二萬元，中次狂跌三萬元。自元陰元再見挫跌一二一萬元，午時零化略動，略見轉定。麵粉消化仍淡，步削一二千元，鈇皮再跌二三千元。　　豆餅供求兩稀，形勢乏神，微挫千元。黃豆供多求少，節節下降，續跌三五千至萬元。赤豆依然呆平之格，菉豆亦趨疲象，莞豆回低三五千元，紅　亦績小三五千元。苞米去化不爽，續短三五千元。芝蔴挺站，生仁速日猛跌之後，華南南銷路轉活，疲而復振，回漲一二萬元。蠶豆到暫稀，另化較股，轉漲三五千元。小麥平局。　　油市因營口續到，四川漢口均有抵申，人心虛軟，豆油淸油步跌萬元，菜油亦疲。惟蔴油尙覺站定，生油亦無軒輕。　　榨油原料無虞缺乏　　〔本報訊〕中信局在蘇州，平湖，蕪湖三地收購菜籽，就已收到之報吿，蘇州已收二千餘担，平制已收三千餘担，蕪湖報吿未到。大豆來源，近因營口情勢轉穩，又可繼續恢復供應。在大豆未到前，可以一收到之菜籽，供給榨油，故榨汕一原料可暫吿無缺云。　　平價麵粉　繼續照配　　〔本報訊〕本月份之平價配粉，原則上已決定繼續照配。粉配處張超，昨會晋謁吳市長，市府已有公事送陳中信局，張氏昨亦與中信局接洽一過。聞出貨技術，配價調整，均將有新決定。一切俟中央銀行張總裁返滬後即可呈准核辦云。　　麵粉業盼出口解禁　　本春各地小麥豐收，價格亦極相宜，每担平均約計十五萬元，第四區麵粉工業同業公會所屬會員各廠，包括蘇常無一錫一帶，前以原料枯竭，被迫停工，於上通起，業已紛起開工。　　上海各廠如茂新·福新·旱豐·裕通·華豐·中大·鴻豐。建成等共擁工人約四千餘人，按照各廠機器設備，至少日需原料共約七萬餘担，每日可產麵粉十二萬包，倘包括各地所屬會員廠在內，則佔計需要原料總量約共十二萬担左右。惟目前麵粉出口禁令未曾取消，坐視華北華南銷路無法爭取，專營本市業務未克擴展，再以資金短促，大量原料一時無法收購，以致形成生產不多，銷路不振之現象。即本市各廠基於以上因素，亦不能經常開工，甚至有每星期祇開工一二天者。　　按麵粉爲輕工業之一種，又爲糧食加工之工業，過去江蘇麵粉廠林立，其供應地帶遠及華北及關外。復員後以重種牽制，其成續距離過去時代太遠。據業人云：希望政府對麵粉出口解禁，迅速至華北各地推廣，並希望政府核准申請貸款，各廠得有資金上之週轉，購辦大宗原料。否則匪僅麵粉工業無以復興，農村經濟更受影響云。民營廠開紗有限紗價趨勢挺秀　　〔本報訊〕日來棉紗價格堅挺，紗商方面意見，認爲此仍係供需關係所迭成。加以一般物價步漲，故紗價未能跌入議價限度內。紗商方面深望國民營紗廠，能多配棉紗，則紗價自平。聞自紡調會議定新價後，民營各廠照議價開售予各紗號之紗，總共不過二三百件。有若干廠照議價開出一個月之期貨，而貨款則須收現，如加一個月貨款之拆息計，廿支紗價又達千萬元關外，故甚望各廠改善售紗辦法云。　　昨日棉紗市况，塲中利買消息頻傳，又以紗廠開紗减少，同業見低拖進，客帮亦有去化，行情乃吿上展。收市四二支藍鳳比上日挺升七十萬，爲一千八百九十萬元。二十支特雙馬軋升二十萬元，雙馬紗上漲漂十五萬元，爲一千零十萬元。細紗三十二支監鳳較跌二十萬元外，其他四十支及三十支十六支等紗，一致挺升二三十萬至四五十萬不一。　　棉紗抵購美金債券　　本市紡強業認購美金公債千萬美元，經當局許可，准以棉紗抵充債款。各紗廠連日均相率實行以棉紗抵購，其價格以美國紗價爲襟準。　　紡建售市　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售一五九八〇疋，申購單共四九〇張。內廠商申請廿四戶，購布二八〇〇疋。布號申購單四六六張，購布一三一八〇疋。　　棉市轉俏　　昨日現棉因棉紗突又轉漲，人心緊俏，執貨者又多扳價，脚地甚堅。紗廠吸胃甚濃，市况轉佳。市上銀根雖緊，但花版以連日內地棉價不小，無利可圖，故脫手後復又抵補，交易旺盛。各檔做開送廠價計　實一九五厲至二〇〇萬，通州粗絨一七一萬至一七三萬，信陽次貨一九七萬。又棧交價　賓一七〇萬，一八六萬，一九一萬，一九〇萬五千至一九五萬，沙市一八七萬，涇陽一九七萬至二〇五萬，信陽二〇五萬，漢粗一六〇萬至一六五萬，通州組絨一七三萬。周浦籽花每組二七萬五千至二九萬五千，火機一五〇萬至一五五萬。茶市內銷挺秀　　內銷茶市，昨情况依然不惡，且仍以楓涇，泗涇，松江一帶，需求紅茶更切，做開價格，因貨主售意咸帶堅化，比前益露穩秀。洋莊交易，午昌茶業公司對於針眉繼續吸進一批，市氣則乏變化。他若向銷法屬非洲之抽珍，珍？　等花色，因市上傳聞彼地開一放變買之消息，愈趨濃郁，乃刻下　法商永興洋行已在騐看外，基他各出口茶商，亦擬向買戶素　茶　。而據業中人云。此項傅說，如能成爲事實，則久居疲　之　茶外銷或可逐步復甦。糖價趨勢貫鬆　　昨糖市以實銷平淡，趨勢軟弱，公會劃盤續鬆二萬許不一。台中砂白初爲五十九萬八千元，後爲五十七萬五千元，台赤五十六萬八千元，至五十五萬元、三半車白六十三萬元，土糖如汕帮揭陽青四十一萬五千元至八千元。棉赤四十九萬元至四十七萬元，興化白五十七萬元至五十六萬五千元。興赤四十七萬元至四十四萬元，亦小萬許。刁青喊原盤，但乏受主，後普通貸開二十七萬六千元，統共不及三百件。絲織業暫停配售後　人絲見新高價　　昨市人造絲，因中信局配售絲織業，暫時停售後，綢廠商頗呈恐慌，均向黑市搜購，以致又造成新高價。一二〇號高山有光，上午市價尙稱平穩，中午收聲價爲二千五百五十萬元，與上日下午價相等，不料下午供求失衡，價又直接上升，因持貨者均待等價而沽，莫不扳悄括價，由五百七八十萬元而至最後竟喊六百七十萬元賣出，比上日又高漲一百二十萬元之鉅。　　廠經平穩　　昨市廠絲行情平穩，做開Ｄ字等級五　，價三千二百萬元，Ｅ字等級十擔，價一百五十萬元，貸款均有三四天期，與上日價無甚上落，中級另　，價在三千〇五十萬至一百萬元之間，高級另擔Ｂ級貨三千二百六十萬元有成交。干經毫無交易，喊價亦稍下降，另據喊價一千九百萬至九百五十萬元之讚。　　綢貸上升　　昨市綢貨眞絲被面因求多於供，價呈上升，美亞被面出三百萬元關外，尙乏供應。大誠被面廠盤開一千二百四十五萬元，塲內昨喊五十萬元賣出。華强被面四十萬元，週一期四十五萬元，大誠格子璧縐即期價最大做一千七百元，最小一千四百元亦有成交，後做一千五百元，週一期做二千元，即期價比上日大二百元。華錦總因人造絲高昂，昨市大起一千元，且乏貨應售，電力紡等銷路已漸衰落，市價無甚變化。中國內衣公司　昨開股東會　　中國內衣紡織染公司，昨日（五日）在大東潛　樓舉行股東臨時會，報吿增資完成經過，及修正章程。並改選黃鴻鈞，黃漢樑，黃漢彥，黃鴻錫，王　生等十五人爲董事，黃仲湖，李棠等三人爲監察人。國家行局內匯率　明日起又將調整　　〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫內匯率，　本月七日起，又將調　，茲分　如次：　　福州每十元收七〇元，（原八〇元）。廣西區九〇元，（原八〇元）。長沙，衡陽及湖南區其他谷地均七〇元，（原四五〇元）。河南區五〇元，（原四五元）。屯溪，歙縣三〇元，（原四〇元）。漢口，武昌均七五元，（原四〇元）。沙市，宣昌，及湖北區其他各地均五〇元，（原四五元）。南昌五元，（原十元）。景　鎭一〇元，贛州三〇元，重慶二〇元，（原一〇元）。萬縣四〇元，（原三〇元）。雲南區二〇元，（原三〇元）。廣州，汕頭，均仍九五元。　　本市各商業行莊昨日內匯率如次（每千元）：　　廣州　一五〇　一〇〇　一二〇　一五〇　　長沙　六〇　六〇　五〇　六〇　　漢口　六〇　六〇　四五　五〇　　昆明　一五　一〇　三〇　三〇　　至大額商匯，漢口爲一〇〇元，廣州爲一八五元。各行莊五月份　匯兌統計　　〔本報訊〕據中央銀行積核處發表，本市各行莊五月份匯兌總數統計，匯入款總數計九一七，一一二，六八八，九〇六。一三元，匯出款總數計二五五，四四五，四〇八，五三七·六四元，匯入超過匯出之百分比爲三六〇。以上數字，尙不包括國家行局及國外匯兌在內。可見各地資金，趨勢仍係羣向上海　集云。紡調會定期商討　共同配銷詳細辦法　配銷機構將設六區公會內　　〔本報訊〕紡調會爲商訂棉紗共同配銷詳細辦法，及下半年度收購原棉辦法，將定於七日上午十時，分別召開成品遝銷及原棉供應應兩小組會議，並定於八日上午九時，召開第四次委員會議。除將討論該兩小組會所提供之方案外，聞鄒主委亦將提出該會全部紗布調

<p>城隍廟的再認識  弱前南　　一年以來，我聽到了不少的藝術家或者愛護藝術的人士，屢次向本市當局大聲疾呼，要求設立美術館和博物館其實博物館，本市是有一個的，戰後復員，因爲館舍爲某一大學所佔據了去，不得不侷促於舊日本小學的一角。至於美術館，聽稅市敎育局現在已經設立一個警備處了。足見這班熱心人的努力，並不徒勞，實在可以欣賀的。　　這班熱心人每次要求建立美術館等等的時候，總是提出「城隍廟」來作爲陪襯，警吿說：「上海眞可憐，有點什麽？只有個城隍廟！」「美術館不要弄成個城隍廟！」「洋人到上海，只知道到城隍廟去，眞丢盡上海的臉！」他們批評藝術作品時，也常常用着「城隍廟裏的貨色」這句話來貶低作品的價値。我每次聽到他們大聲疾呼。。本報攝。　　指摘城隍廟　　　的時候，我的反應總是特別强烈。我想你們一方面知道愛護美術，提倡美術，另一方面却拚命討厭城隍廟，究竟是什麽道理！十年廿年之前，你們還在童年時，不是也最喜歡到城隍廟莫云的嗎？爲什麽現在城隍廟在你們面前，竟一雙而爲眼中訂，簡直像勢不兩立，非拔去不可呢？　　最近一個藝術界的集會裏，我聽見誣蔑指摘城隍廟的，有三四個人之多，而這三四個人的宏論，居然使全體出席的人都爲之首肯似的，不禁大爲喫驚。我終於忍耐不住了，寫下了這篇文字，發表出來，請求全上海的藝術家們多多的指正！　　我國上自首都，下至鄉村，各地都有城隍廟一類的廟宇，成爲大衆遊　塲所的。例如南京夫子廟，蘇州玄妙觀，上城隍廟都是。那城隍廟一類的塲所，不僅本地人，不論男女老少總是喜歡去遊覽，就是外方人也一定要去觀光。城隍廟實在具有引人　　遊覽的魔力　　那廟裏，有的是戲台，春秋佳日，表現幾台好戲，邀請全地方的人去欣賞，不用化費分文。平常則有打拳頭賣膏藥的；有小熱昏，唱小調說因果；有打着小鑼出賣梨膏糖的；有出賣各種飛禽走獸的動物店；有各種刀槍面具發售的玩具攤；有小書攤花紙店；更有許多點心店茶館古董鋪。逢時逢節，便有應時的東西出現，風箏哪，兎子燈哪，摺扇哪，一季有一季的貨色，花花綠綠，煞是好看。雖然城隍廟裏的一切，是我們所看慣了的，但是爲什麼除了別有用心之輩，人人還不時要到城隍廟去白相白相呢？　那理由是很簡單。因爲城隍廟的一切，第一，都是我們祖宗所遺傳下來，而仍爲我們所樂於接受的；第二，廟裏的一切東西都是經過幾千百年的淘汰選擇過來的；第三，廟裏的一切東西，原米是分散於各個地界的，而今集中一起陳列了。　　如果用時髦的話說起來，那就是城隍廟是一個集中了中華民族形式的一切東西的塲所。這廟裏的一切中華民族形式的東西，在我們血液裏是已生了根的，是無可抗拒而不得不愛好着的。　　打拳頭所賣的膏藥，也許一無效用，可是他打的拳却打得並不壞。我們不能因爲他打中國拳，就說他遠不如西洋的撲克星。小熱昏唱的四季相思，如果不管唱的人衣衫　　，只論聲音詞句，那末比西洋情歌，我想決不會遜色。南翔饅頭，烤油魚，綫粉湯等等的點心，新進藝術家們決不會因爲是中國民族形式的東西而謝絕不喫的。廟裏所出賣的畫幅，誠然用筆用墨不及大畫家的工細，但那大紅大綠的色彩，氣魄驚人的綫條，却正是我們數千年傳統下下來的形式。總之，像上海城隍廟那樣，自房屋建築，假山池沼，茶寮酒館，以至成佛店，象牙舖，五香豆攤，全部是經過大衆所選擇出來的，是我們無可抗拒地愛好着的。　　城隍廟集中了我國一切的工藝美術，集中了我國一切傳統的游藝，聚中中了我國固有的可口的果點，成爲一個中國本來面目的遊　塲所。說它是中國本色的博物館，或者中國本色的美術館，也未嘗不可！　　城隍廟是中國的；城隍廟是集中中國　　文化的結晶　　的塲所。西洋人到中國來，要知道眞正的中國，眞正的中國民族文化，請間除了到城隍廟去以外，還能到什麼地方去呢？到亞洲文會的博物館去嗎？到震旦博物館去嗎！那種博物館申自然一也可以去的。可是這種博物館是西洋人來敎化華人的，在歐美多得很，他們早已看膩了。他們到上海來，何必再到這種他們所常去的博物館呢？只有到城隍廟去，才能看見中國眞正的文化。假使他們萬幸，買一塊梨着糖來喫，也許他們還發覺竟比朱古力糖好喫。馬蒂斯如果到城隍廟裏看看花紙畫幅，他亦許能得到非常的靈感，而欽佩不已。陸丹沒有死的話，到廟中看看成佛店的工作，他便　決不會慨嘆上海沒有一個離刻家。　　城隍廟是我們大衆所建設的一個中國民族形式的博物館，所以用不到官方學者們編輯什麽英文說明書宣傳。我們早有一大批　天通事，應用一套然練的洋涇浜話來指點歐美遊客了。他們說明九曲橋是中國式的橋，灣灣曲曲，很有趣味。那屋脊上的巨大人物是中國的雕塑，由泥水匠所揑製的。外國人聽了不禁驚訝到眼睛睜得像銅鈴般大了。洋人要買瓷器，靈天通事便領到古玩舖或者瓷器店裏去選擇。凡是中國土貨的藝術品，城隍廟照例是色色供全。所以洋人遊過城隍廟後，除去對於垃圾以及行人道狹小不潔感到不滿之外，他們總覺得此行不虛。　　也許有人以爲我太强調城隍廟了，他們就請出那位做一支那遊記」的芥川龍之介來辯護。表現民族生活藝術的夏令必需品：折扇（城隍廟扇店一瞥）　（本報攝）　　芥川到上海　　城隍廟去觀光，發見池中的水而浮着綠色垢濁，池的周閑用石疊起奇怪的欄干，還有一個拖着長辦子的中國人悠然在池中小便。他到廟前去遊，看見人們非常擁擠。那面走着漂亮洋服綴着水晶領結定針的中國時髦婦人，這面走着戴銀項圈的小脚三寸的舊式婦人。金瓶梅中的陳敬濟，品花寳鑑中的奚十一－這許多人里面，這類豪傑似乎也有着。但是什麼杜甫，什麼岳飛，什麽王陽明，什麽諸葛亮，却似乎一個都找不出。　芥川不愧是日本現代的一個傑出之士，所以他的咒罵中國，也比普通一般日人高明。原來現代的日本人，凡到中國來遊歷的，無非想找一點咒罵中國的材料，而芥川聰明，一到上海便到城隍廟裏去找材料，果然罵得我們格外痛快，格外淋漓盡緻。可備他早死了幾年，沒有看見戰爭，更沒有看見戰後的日本。城隍廟裏不僅有陳敬濟奚十一，幷且還有芥川一類人呢，不是芥川志記了自己的高貴，便是把自己也算在陳敬濟一流人物中問了。他在城隍廟裏找不到岳飛一類人，很爲抱憾、豈知在此次戰爭中，城隍廟　進出的人氣魄和岳飛一樣偉大的，不怕任何犧牲和日本拼命的，竟不知　　少呢。　　戰後上海虹口日人集中區，我曾經幾次去觀光，關於　　日人拆爛污　　的情形我還保有很多的紀錄，像芥川所見的池邊小便，日本人在集中區裏比中國人還要悠然坦然呢。至於猥幾，殘酷，貪欲的情形，日人在戰時已表現得十分動人，爲空前所未有，戰後更其表現得淸楚明白了。所惜芥川死得太平，沒有看見他們同胞今日的一副尊容。　　不必諱言，城隍廟裏缺點很多，大可訾議。但是凡可訾議之處，却是屬於人事管理方面的，而於城隍廟本身並無關係。假使池水日日調換，何來綠色的汚濁。隨地小便與吐痰，如果嚴厲禁止，那惡習自然可也澈底消滅。假使湖心旁的茶館，拆去重造，池周侵佔公地的房屋，一律拆除，而仍准沿地設攤，不是原來城隍廟的風貌衙行恢復了嗎？總之，城隍廟爲人惡劣的印象，都是從人事管理方面來的，至於城隍廟本身及其內容，却經常保持着廟會的情形，依然是民族形式。城隍廟裏一切民族形式的美術游藝以及食物等等，說它安排得不好，裝飾得不好，宣傳得不好，是可以的。如果說民族形式的一切，都惡劣不堪，非打倒不可，那末只有去做洋人一決。不過萬一做了洋人之後，如果仍舊沒有一點規律·沒有）點新舊道德觀念，那末即辦成了洋式美術館洋式博物館，其成績一定要比城隍廟還要差。所以眞正佛像舖子　本報攝　　要發揚藝術　　只有從愛護城隍廟一類民族形式的大衆遊覽塲做起，才能眞正走上藝術建設的大路。愛護了城隍廟，便可時刻替城隍廟設法，如何裝飾得更好看，更堂皇，更動人。　我更希望上海的市政當局，對於城隍廟也能再認識一下，不僅消極地减少廟中的一切惡化腐化現象，並且要踏前一步，意識到城隍廟是中國民族生活藝術的代表塲所，要組織一個計劃委員會，分期進行，造成一個値得呈獻給世界的中國民族形式的博覽塲所。如能一旦實現，那眞是一件不朽的盛事。　　（附言）我這篇短文，寫成之後擱置已久，誠恐發表出來，會引起無謂的誤解。但我覺得：第一，一個民族文化藝術的歷史，是像一條江河，不是可以一刀兩斷的。新文化藝術的產生是一定在固有的文化藝術容納接受了外來的文化議術時候；第二，現代化的文化藝術固然亟待建設，但建設現代化的文化藝術時，不必迫害摧毁固有的文化藝術；第三，排繫民族形式的文化藝術與建設現代化的文化藝術，是一個整個文化藝術的兩面，是並行而不悖的。</p>

<p>春秋	寫生正名  蔣維喬　　先兄可莊擅書畫金石，故余自幼喜看畫，然不能作　。對於時賢之作，必設法收集，而尤愛俞子劍華寫生之作。憶民二十一夏，將而遊華岳，難得健步之遊侶，最後乃偕俞子及其弟子徐培基，入潼關，上太華絕頂，歷千尺　，百尺峽，蒼龍嶺，鷂子翻身，長空棧諸險境。俞子師生素筆囊硯，隨地寫生；遇奇峯怪石，飛瀑流泉，必細心描繪，曲盡其狀。於雲姻變幻，朝暉夕陰之光景，尤三致意焉。辦華山三日，師弟各成畫册數事，命曰華山寫生紀遊岡册。　　余以爲寫生之名，似不甚當。蓋寫生一名，始於宋之趙昌，昌擅花卉，迎風合露，恣態如生。故自號曰「寫生趙昌」。及至近代，西畫東漸，遂以依照實物描寫之畫，不論人物花卉，靜物風景，槪日寫生。而西畫則名曰「描寫自然」（Sketchers　From　Namre），似較寫生一名爲合。中國山水畫所寫，不外高山峻嶺，古樹流泉，殊無生之可言，以余觀之，應另定名爲「寫景」；而以寫人物花島者爲「寫生」。景之一字，在五代荆浩已列入六要之中；而宋郭熙推關尤爲盡致。西畫名山水爲風景，今以之名描寫實地風景之晝日寫景，於中於西，均無不合。嘗以此意吿俞子，頗韙余言。今値俞子將其寫景山水公展之際，特書數言，以與藝林方家商榷焉。達文西的童年  徐帆　　意大利佛羅倫斯城附近，有一羣被阿奴（Arno）湖環抱着的披滿了葛　的狄斯加尼（Tuscaye）山巒，其中躺着欲睡的是文西（Vinci）小鄕村在這四周的山頂的崖石上滿級着古代的堡壘和砲台。在送些山上的葛藤中雜長着銀灰色的小橄欖樹。到處可以看到巍巍的柏樹昂立着，黑綠地伸向光亮的意大利天空。　　十五世紀初期，在這個文西小鄕村裏住着賽比羅（Serpiero，他是一個由祖父就繼承下來的律師，沒有誰聽到關於他與他宜先們的什麼　件，除了一四五二年，那年賽比羅做了一惆私生孩子的父親，那孩子呌做黎阿奴多·達文西（Leonardo　De　Vinci）。　　達文西的母親幾乎沒有誰知道，據說她是一個鄉野女孩笳多海娜（Catourir），她獨自把這美麗的孩子一直看養到五歲才交給他的父親賽比羅。在這期間她嫁給一個粗書的農夫，生活在辛勞興貧困的糾　中。　　在　文西出生的同時，賽比羅爲了自己與家庭的關係也結婚了。他們沒有孩子，於是恰好把達文西帶到家裏做爲他們自已的孩子。不久這妻子死了，賽比羅娶了第二個妻子，但仍沒有孩子。因此，當達文西二十五歲時已成了他父親唯一的孩子，家裏的希望與溫暖都集口在他身上。　　達文西是一個美麗的孩子，他酷愛美，他無時不在尋覓它，他喜歡凝望許多從地面或四周起飛的鳥雀，穿越在光亮的藍色天空，他採集許多可愛的花仔細地研究它們的結構。他的歌喉悅耳而動人，他會彈似六弦琴式的　　。他崇慕馬隊，他很早就能崎馬馳夠。　　不論怎樣他總是熱心地聽着師長們對他的敎導，但他探聽的心是遠超過這些狹隘的知識，在他早時作言行錄者有這樣的記戴：「在算術裘，他常常得不到滿意的解答，敎他的老師不斷地爲他提出的難解的理論與困難解釋。」　　孩童時代，達文西玩耍在明朗的陽光或葛藤與橄欖樹下，他快樂地呼吸着葡萄，野玫瑰和杏仁的芳香。當他的小腿漸漸壯健起來，他就走到江湖邊上去遊玩，守望它們舞蹈的水波。的確，水波似乎常常迷惑着達文西，他靑年的好奇心催使他去實騐研究這些自然的迭化。　　當這小達文西的手指能掘起一指鉛筆或一段粉筆時，他就開始描畫他所看到的一切。他　着湖水，山崖，鳥雀花朶和人物：…。是的，一些成功的畫家在他們孩童時代的興趣可以看出他們的以後的，因爲賽比羅與許多畫家都很熟悉。　　有一次，賽比羅搬家到佛羅倫斯，到後十二萬分喜悅地去并訪他的朋友佛荷茜奧（Yerocchio），他孩子時的一些實就得到這美術家熱烈的鑽揚，佛荷茜奧是非常歡迎這有希望的靑年到他的工作室去學習。從此，遽文西正式走進了繪畫之門，開始他偉大的藝術生活。百年來的國畫  陸丹林　　宇宙間的一切那有固定的不變的事物呢？「十年人事幾番新」，它是時時刻刻的在變動中。我們只看百年以來，中國的政治·軍事·文化·經濟等等，都有念劇的轉變。藝術的變動，更有他的跡象可以尋覓。雖然，中國的藝術，自從佛敎入華之後，作風已有轉變了。明末，天主敎傳來，西歐的美術，跟着輸入，畫風又一度受了影響。滿淸中葉，基督新教，自西徂東。不久，海禁大開，歐美的文化與美術，如浪濤的汹湧·排山倒倒海而來。因之，我國的文化，藝術，政治與人民的生活，都受了極大的波動。　　太平天國崛起以後、滿淸的紙老虎戳穿了，內憂外患，像　轤般輾轉交遞。畫家的數量，雖然沒有减少，可是畫風便日漸銳變。到了同治·光緒的時期，淸政更加敗壞，一部分畫人多在上海賣畫，爲着生活的掙扎，有些只得迎合（遝就）顧客的愛好，來博潤金，於是畫品便不免流入俗濁的歧途。　　在此期間，任熊一家和他的弟子們，雖然能用鈎勒畫法，但是，他的氣韻，脫不了獷悍習氣，只存着鈎勒之名，失却了黃荃的法乳。吳昌碩異軍突起，用篆籀的筆法入畫，王眞爛漫，雄健古厚，飽含金石氣，是別樹一職的作品。然而在晚淸末年以至民國初年以後，西洋畫漸漸的蔓延，畫壇上便發生了幾種不同的事象，約略的檢討，可分爲四：是一部分畫家，還是極力保護四王的遺蛻，孳孳矻矻的描摹習作。其他一部分的畫家，却不滿於四王的　敗，自闢途徑，想着糾正四王的頹風，他們自命是擔起了扶危濟傾的職責。又有一部分晝人，提倡復古，摹仿宋元，說是這纔是東方唯一的正宗藝術。還有一部分呢，他們認定中國的畫學，經已破產，不適用於現代，故他們却研習日本書或西洋畫來陶鎔國畫，說是融通中外古今的　作。是丹非素，入主出奴，各宗各派，互立門戶。形成一種混沌紊亂的局勢。　　所以百年來的中國　風，是非常凌亂的，說他好的方面，是天天在變動中，改善中，吐棄糟粕，吸收新的營養，多方面的嘗試，接近新的，國際的。反之·他是天天在摸索中，究竟復古呢，趨新呢？還找不着己應該走的路綫。這是不可爲諱的現象·然而在此凌亂錯綜的藝壇，自然也有獨特的作品，是　性超脫，蒼秀雋雅的，香艷妍麗，極右韻致的，魄力雄渾，筆意勁挺的，風神俊逸，態度淵雅的，各臻其妙。上海市美術館籌備處近將籌辦「百年畫展」如果能够把這些作品，甄選若干，給我們系統的研究百年來的畫風，分析他們的演變，實在是很有深切的意義。題俞華教授所作五尺連幅　黃山大觀圖　　（一）　陳定山　　三年五上黃山院，今日重過不自由；一岫一峯俱惜別，此中三十六因頭。　　不上黃山已十年，夢中猿鶴等雲姻，畫師爲我增圖稿，白髮重遊豈偶然。　　（二）　　白蕉　　十載黃山夢，今朝得臥遊；家老子筆有鬼，落墨遂使天地愁。　　（三）　徐心芹　　虛舟巨望原如此，故國青山最可思；高閣酒醒人不倦，臥遊還似構圖時。　　（四個）　徐心芹　　奇松雲海名天下，收拾先生畫卷中，漫道新凉驚四座，高懸四壁起淸風。　　（五）　老丹　　曾到黃山脚，未登天都峯今觀劍華畫，始信入化工。·劉開渠·黃山大觀  俞劍華劍華師畫展  劉開渠　　俞師劍華是一位多才多藝的藝人，他對於藝術的愛好，可以說是根於遺傳，由於天性；尤其是對於造型藝衛·尤有癖嗜。他早年對於工藝，圖案，繪畫都有普遍的研究，他所著的「最新圖案法」（商務版）在二十多年前是中國圖案界惟一的好書。他後來漸漸集中注意力於繪畫，西畫裏的木炭，水彩，油畫；用器畫方面的機械，投影，透視，建築，他都貪婪的加以習練和探討，最後乃致力於國畫。在國畫裏山水，人物，花卉，翎毛也都畫的很多，但是他却專意於山水。在山水裏宗派很多，他雖對谷家都加以涉獵，却專心於實地寫生。遍遊宇內名山大川，如天台，雁蕩，廬山，武夷，泰山，黃山，白岳，九華，無不有他寫生的足跡，而尤愛黃山，所寫以黃山爲最多，近寫「黃山大觀」一幅，能將黃山全般面貌，顯示在觀者面前，千巖萬　，氣象萬千。一方面固足表示黃山的偉大，一方面更足表示俞師藝術的精深。有人以學問比作金字塔，下邊要有廣博的基礎，上邊才能有高超的建迭。　　以俞師藝術常識的豐富，無怪有這種偉大的成就，但俞師年尙未老，精力正強，現在的作品，自然還不能算是金字塔的頂點。由博反約，日作精深的研究，進步正米有止境。他道幅黃山大觀在一般畫家看來，至少須晝一個月，而俞師在五天之內就畫好。這種下筆如飛的本領，在現代書家裏恐怕也不多吧！　　現在俞師將其數年在後方所作精品數百件，公開展覽，謹志數語，以志景仰。談藝術家  沈雁　　藝術家是什麼呢？藝術家是愛人生而受其魅惑的人。在這一點上他是一個行爲的人，而與英雄相似。可是他的活動重一點在於精神或像夢一般的東西一點上與英雄又有區別。他並不是克服具體的現實，用體力來抵抗；而是在含有人生意義的構想形像中感覺自己。他有旺盛的表現力，他對於實物可以發生空想，可以將隨便虛構的內容賦予它生命，而爲這種虛幻的感覺再激發他自己。他在這種夢想出來的感動領域中是一個鬥爭者，是一個勝利者；目同時是一偶旁觀者。在他的表現中，他的創迭物的靈魂是他所爭取的目的，他帶着）種聽從他的魔杖指揮的意識。而他的激動的背後，有一種以冷靜的心把他種成分的悟性或智　支持着。　　藝術家是如何成長？誰爲我們編出他的發展史？爲何自然衝動會如此的發生內向作用？關於這種問題我們除非有一個偉大的詩人出現，一面由他創迭，一面監視他創造，而對於自己和世界把他的構迭物的受胎和出產時各種動機或內在情形，不加修飾的紀錄下來以外，恐怕是得產到至答案的。音樂的話  寧敘仁　　　音樂是最好的藝衛，比別的什麼都能援助人類的和平。有美麗的音樂之處，是很難得使生活不滿意的。－（Herbert　Spancer)　　音樂是難抵抗的，它的力量是無限的；它指導仁愛的情緒和平和友愛。－（Thackeray）許伯爾德  萍　　許伯爾德（Schubert）曾有貝多芬的繼承者之譽，生前異常潦倒。作了大量的歌曲，如「聽雲雀，「聖母頌」等，大部份都被愛好音樂的人們在歌唱着。他的第八交　曲是沒有作完的。這便　次們在都知道的一支未　交　　，這支曲子正象　這音氏的　　。（　　市府整隊　　　　）　　一寸山河一寸血335  葉勁風　　丁君病到如此地步，別說我這面生人問不出該羣的消息，恐怕連他親生父母，和妻室兒女，站在跟前，他也不會認識。　　「這正是我要探尋的市要綫索之一，他身上可以找出一連串的重要秘密！」我把眞話假說，向日方特工首腦，狠狠抱怨了幾句，呌他命令該管當職，把丁君送到醫院裏去。他們答應送丁君到臨時後方醫院就診，我說「那裏設備不完全，不如送到市立或私立醫院；我還有其他妙用」。他們說，蛤要敎曾負實；就可照辦。　　據醫師的診斷，丁君的病症，不只平當的傷認發炎，也不只敲打電刑·種種神經刺戟的後果·却有些像急性結核藏膜炎與認口炎同時　發。要是單純急性結核腦膜炎，只要背脊抽水打針之後，速有間歇性的淸醒，無奈傷口不輕，加之受了非刑的刺戟，生命固然無望，連問歇性的片刻與智淸楚，都辦不到了。　　我當然失望。但爲了　羣的消息，和丁君的生命，我要求醫師盡最大努力，救丁君一命。可是醫師說，假如他的診斷不誤，別說中國天津這個小地方，就送到美最大最完備的醫院專去，丁君的一條性命，也只有四十萬分之一的希望！換句話·每四十萬人中，也許可以救活一惆；還得素日康健·抵抗力强大。　　果然醫師施行抽水，檢騐，打針，等等手續之後，這位受了傷，而又受了非刑，而又受了非人性磨折的愛國男兒，一分鐘竟比一分鐘沉重下去，兩隻手臂一刻不停地，比劃着有規律的動作－寫字，描準，放槍，打電報，等等－這大槪是他平日服務的幾項重要工作，已經演成下意識習性，在高熱度神智昏迷狀况下，一一重演循環不停。此外，隔不一會，嘴唇顫動，嘶嗄的聲帶，發出一兩個字音。我細心靜聽，由那糢糊字音裏，辨明了他所說的幾個字，也如同那習慣性手勢一般，只是有規律地循環重複着－打，幹，快，留神，…。連來！　　「連來」，最後這兩個字音，我雖聽得明白，却猜不出意思；又不像口令，又不像招呼人姓名。後來在日倭特務部，丁君名下存件的一封家信內，才查明丁君的夫人名呌「蓮」，唯一的三歲愛女名呌「小蓮」；這才知道「連來」兩字，也許是「蓮　」，或「運運來」！　　四十幾小時後，醫師雖然努力盡了應盡的責任，丁君終於嘆了最後一口氣，撤手長逝了。星期閑話皮爾遜無罪  海風　　先介紹一通東京三日的電報：　　「十九歲之美軍星人士兵詹姆斯，強姦本船戶之妻，樂於三日經軍事法庭判決死刑。」　　在半年以前，曾經以臨姦北大女生沈崇案的美國士兵皮爾遜，下落如何呢？　　我們且以近一週來的新聞來說明這事態的發展。　　北大校長胡適於六月廿日在平對　美海軍部軍法檢視官長將取消皮爾遜的罪狀一點，表示失望。他說：　　「審判皮爾遜時，我曾列席旁聽，根據一切證據，被告應犯強罪。……氏以了一種極歲正的態度，表白了他對這事件的看法：　　「全中國正嚴密注視美國法律尊嚴之試騐。」　　這是一個可以代表全中國人民的看法。　　我們且看各方面對此的反應：　　（一）北大院孫學生聯合會，對皮爾遜之判決無罪已表示態度。　　（二）外交部已訓令我駐美大使顧維鈞，對旨姦中國女學生之皮爾遜之判決被美當局撤銷一事，向美方詢問，並經由司徒大使要求美方維持北平美軍事法庭對該犯之原判。（按：原判皮爾遜爾姦罪成立，處從刑十五年。）　　（三）直到六月三十日，司徒大使在燕京大學答覆者詢問時，曾有如下之答覆：　　問北平美軍中姦中國女生沈崇案，主犯皮爾孫在美國宣判無罪，大使看法如何？　　答：昨天特打電報去問，問電稱該案向未宣判，刻美海軍校高當局尙在着查中。　　但判決無罪的流言又何所根據呢？　　據我們推測，美國檢察長，已經有取消皮爾遜狀的決定，現在只待美海軍部長的批准罷了。所以司徒大使答增記者時，也說：「美海軍最當局尙在審查中」，可見皮爾遜罪狀以目前情型看，很有翻案的可能。　　但是美國是一個治的國家，對於這有關兩國友誼與邦交的案件，想會鄭重其事吧。自由談蕭伯納夫人  管中窺　　將近百臨的文字巨匠蕭伯納，能夠有今日的成就，可以說是多虧他的賢內助，由於他的溫柔和善的性情和態度，同優越的糾織與管理的能力，隨時給予蕭翁以蓼不和鼓勵，不用他担心家庭瑣事，她爲他安排一個寗靜而富藝術性的環境，讓他靜心的從事寫作。　　蕭翁夫人是平湯馨女士，她是一個社會改革的理想於實行家，她有高度的對社會服務心，所以關於一切社會改革的集會與活動，無一沒有她熱情棄一切虛榮，而且儘量避免出鋒頭的機會，因此，在報紙上和可以吸引公衆汪意的塲所，却不易發現她的名字和踪跡。　　她和蕭翁相遇及交友時，蕭翁還是一個無名小卒，還是許多成天奔走不息的新聞記者之一，但是她憑着特有的慧眼，早已敬重他白才和爲人了·有一鎰，蕭翁受到意外的創傷，幾至一病不起，由於她盡心竣力的看護，才逐漸痊愈，蕭翁爲她深厚的情誼所感動，在一八九八年和她結婚，因爲她辛勤的鼓勵和慰藉，使他棄新聞事業而專心於文學創作。　　舊翁同他的夫人結婚，已經是四十二歲的中年了，他的夫人和他的結婚典禮，曾經鬧過一個笑話，蕭翁第一提及時仍然笑不可仰。據說他倆的婚禮是定在註冊局里舉行的，他預先在朋友中請了兩位做證婚人，其中一位使是很著名的社會哲學家瓦勒斯，這兩位已具相當社會地位的證婚人，穿著自然比新郎好過幾倍，在當時的蕭翁，搜遍衣箱也找不出一套够得上稱頂好的服裝，以致他儘管興高彩烈地忙於招待應酬，可是那位主持婚禮的註册官，却沒有把他放在眼內，以爲他那身衣飾不配作新郎。臨到婚禮開始時，那位註册官亂點鴛鴦譜，把平湯　女士硬配給衣衫華麗的瓦勒斯先生，雖然這錯誤立刻被糾正過來，然而在曾時那幕情景已够令人發噱。　　蕭翁夫人不僅是一位嫵媚悅人，藹然可親的女子，而且也是天才的文學家，吏與蕭翁同具幽默感，不過爲她太著名的丈夫才氣所淹沒了，她的文學造詣很高，不可否認的，她對英國文學也曾有不可磨減的貢獻，如像她不辭艱難，盡力　力地從事譯述工作。她把法國名劇作家白里歐氏的劇本盡量的介紹到英國去，她對白里歐氏劇本的有愛好和崇敬，與篇翁一度對易卜生的劇本的愛好毫無一致。不過她是對白里歐終身信服吧了。　　她是極看有勇氣和魄力的女子，她批判近世文明的缺點，　提供出歷代視爲定案而其實錯誤的問題。她是爲社會謀改造最力的人。她翻譯白里歐的劇本暢達明快，因爲白里歐的劇本對於英國社會亦有同樣的價值，故想盡種一種方法，勸請審查委員會，允許白里歐劇本在英國演出。她自己也是英國舞台協會的執行委員，經過她的努力，好容易才終於說服那些頑梗不化的人，而獲得了勝利。鶴沖天  胡盧　　物價　　飛直綫。創高峯，像患急驚風，偏偏碰着慢郎中，藥石屢投空！　　苦够熬，寃難說，誰顧窮人生活？米逾五十萬元關，粒粒淚珠彈！知之過遲  公弢　　一個人因爲眼睛腫起，耳朶亂鳴，便去看醫生；第一個醫生吿訴他是扁桃腺的毛病，應當割去，可是手術後病况依然。他又去看另外一位醫生。這位醫生建議他把牙齒都拔掉，但事後他眼睛仍然腫着，耳朶仍在亂鳴。於是他只好再去請敎另一位醫生。這位衛生在檢查後却很爽快的吿訴他：「這是不治之症，你只有六個月好活了！」　　他於是決定乘死前痛痛快快的享樂一番。他買了部新汽車，又作了幾十套新衣服。這天他又到一家舖子去定作襯衫。裁縫量了他的尺寸，說：「袖子三子四寸，領子十六寸。」　　「爲什麼要十六寸？我一直在穿十五寸目領子。」　　「不是的，先生。」這裁縫說：「我要警吿你，假如你再一直穿十五寸的領子，你的限睛要　起，你的耳朶也要亂鳴的。』讚美的秘訣  　　假如你要讚美一個人，你應當要較具體的去臘美他。如果你要　獎一個人的家專好，當避兔只空虛的說：「你的家眞不錯呀！」要選擇較特殊的地方，如商外的景緻，室內的佈置等，不要只誇獎一惆女人的帽子：「與你很配合」，要想法從　的角度與顏色來讚美惟。茉莉花  虛人　　茉莉是屬於木本植物，性喜暖畏寒，春天二三月間，是它栽種的時候，把舊技剪下，成爲一段一段，約四五寸長，栽在泥土中，上固用細沙遮蓋，十餘天就會發芽，從沙土中露出頭來。然後在園中掘好泥畦，將已生芽的茉莉，每十幾枝集爲一叢，移植於泥畦中，每叢之間空出若干距離。到了第二年的初夏，這茉莉花就開始結蕊了，每叢可開出二三十朶美麗的花，陰曆九月間就停放了，這時用稻草蓋覆禦寒，度過這冬天後，第二年春天又可栽植了。　　茉莉有洋種，土種，單苔，重苔等種類，以重苔品質最爲珍貴，顏色比他種更白，香氣也更濃烈，可以經過三四天花不會枯萎，而且花瓣是重疊成爲五瓣的，像蓮花的形狀。　　除了裝飾外，茉莉花還可用火蕙，和在茶葉中製成色香味俱佳的茉莉香茶，這是福建出口的特產，因此鄕村農民倚賴栽種茉莉花爲生活的極多，所以在福建很難看見茉莉栽植在土缽陶盆中，而是田野間數十頃乃至數百頃的茉莉花園，散步其中，一望無涯盡是潔白如雪的花海，成爲奇觀。署夏的傍晚，淸風從花叢中吹來，夾着强烈的香氣。　　在這赤紅色的夏天，不但衣服要穿白的，任何物件只要是白色的，呌人望去都有一種淸凉爽目之感。花是人所喜愛的，造物者特爲人們在夏天開放了一些一潔白的花朶，於是茉莉花、白蘭花等就成了人暑天的心愛的花。　　在一切的鮮花中，最能親近婦女香澤的算是茉莉。二十年前，婦女們大半還沒剪去頭髮，大家都釣心鬥角的講頭髮的梳妝，到了夏天，歸女歡喜用嫩銅絲穿插在茉莉花朶的脚上，將許多花尕拚合起來·做成一個弧形的花環，或者別的玲瓏精巧的形樣，圍繞在精緻的髮　的上面，年輕女郎們也用銅絲將茉莉穿成蝴蝶式和圓月式等，縣在襟旁或胸前，但是以後婦女都剪了頭髮，再沒有髮響可以闈繞茉莉花了。至於胸前襟間懸掛茉莉的風尙也早已成爲過去了，茉莉花再不能接近婦女的髮香肌膩，這該是茉莉花的悲哀吧。舊世界的聲音  李箴　　「恐怖片」　「天羅地網」　　從俯首稱臣舞台劇改編過來的「天羅地網」，顯然是一個社會劇。由於導演把握不住這個戲的基調，趙馥堂謀殺外甥時，那個外甥就顯得極爲不通人情。　　聰明的導演者只注意了「恐怖」的塲面，但是「恐怖」氣氛依然掩蓋不了那個不現實而歪曲的題材。　　喬奇的趙馥堂有較佳的演出、但太緊張了一點，過多了一點；懷錦前半段戲尙平穩，後面出走前的一段戲，顯得突然變了調。蘇曼意的交際花，連台詞都不會唸，更不用談其他動作表情了。　　這部戲的錄音却有着特佳的成績。　　陳腐的「卿何薄命」　　這個片子中，劇作者硬塞給觀衆一些「宿命論」的觀念，他把大學生都寫成了可憐虫，尤其那個「簿命」女子周玉淸。她處處鼓人擺佈着，她不敢反抗，　也不願反坑，受人欺海，受人侮辱，一切相信了命運。這已經足够諷刺了編導者的近視了。　　時代在進步，陳腐的，落伍的，舊世界的聲音，永遠只能個　　般躲在黑暗里散發它的腐臭。　　王熙春的周玉淸，平穩稱職，徐立感情太激動，戲總是在跳動中，郭平的朱文俊這個人物本身就不統一，演出上也是缺少內在的情感。　　此片導演，及技術上，無一可取之處　　別具風格的「壯士春夢」　　英國片有它別具的風格，細膩而生活化，沒有美國片那種浮躁的情感。這部「壯士春夢」描寫英國軍官克萊夫坎的一身事蹟，他的交友，戀愛，決鬥，行獵，從軍等一切生活事件，用這些一事件串連了他的一生事業。無疑地這是部傳記片。値得一提的，是演男主角克萊夫坎的勞　李佛西，從靑年，中年，到老年，刻劃三個時期　有着　然不同的演出，格外是老年時的克萊夫坎，有一種難以令人忘懷的印象。　　導演處理全片樸實無華，淸麗動人，幾處重複的對照運用，都顯示了他的總明　　清麗的「露滴牡丹」　　並不像廣告上所用的那些色情的句子，這部戲却有着正確而生動的內容。這描寫一個從事舞蹈發術的女孩子，在她一生中所經歷的過程，勉堅持着將整惆生命貢獻給藝術，也在藝術上獲得了永遠光輝的生命，　　在導演的細膩處理下，這是一部感人至深的好片子。洛麗泰揚有着特佳的收穫。演舞蹈家柔星的康萊維德，是男演　中最洗練而爈火純靑的一人了。　　二張歌舞片　　「桃李競芳」與「月到中秋分外明「，這二張歌舞片，前者要較佳於後者，尤其「桃李　芳」的故事編寫得較有風　，許多歌唱塲面的安排，也要合情理得參。「月到中秋分外明」就顯得整個較爲空虛，演出上也差得多。　　其他「血剿特工黨」與山紐約歷險記」「人海　」等都只能算是三四院片子了。除了開打塲面興驚　的顯外，在電影藝術上，就不能再要求什麼了。星期漫畫兩小無猜  元各有千秋  耳聰仁者之諷  延年</p>

Currently, representatives from the certain country are stationed in Jiamusi, Fujin, Songbei, and Lushun-Dalian to oversee the loading and transportation.</p>

<p>Hu Shih Discusses Two Types of Political Parties</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party and the Nazis Belong to the Second Type</p>
<p>The Government's Full-Scale Suppression of the Rebellion is Inevitable</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 5th] After the issuance of the Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion, this reporter visited Hu Shih today to inquire about his thoughts. Hu, busy with university affairs, had not yet had time to read the newspaper. After the reporter informed him of the main points of the Suppression of Rebellion Order, Hu said that the government's suppression of the communists was a fait accompli, and the issuance of this Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion clearly indicates the government's attitude. Since the Chinese Communist Party is using all its strength to overthrow the government, it is conceivable that the government will use all its strength to suppress the communists. As for how international forces will influence the government's actions, the most important thing now is how the mobilization for the suppression of rebellion will develop. Hu added, "My hometown of Jixi was completely undamaged during the eight years of the War of Resistance, and it can be called a paradise. Three days after the communist army arrived after the victory, they completely destroyed Jixi. Therefore, I believe that President Chiang's statement at the Political Consultative Conference that he was deeply saddened by the internal strife that occurred after the victory was heartfelt. Even those in the planning community are saddened that China, after joining the ranks of the victorious Four Great Powers, has suffered such a calamity." Hu also discussed the two different types of political parties in the world in relation to the Chinese problem, saying that there are type A political parties like those in Britain and the United States, which compete for votes through peaceful means and regard voter support as the standard for advancement or retreat. There are also type B political parties like those in Eastern and Southern Europe, such as the Fascists, Nazis, and the Chinese Communist Party. These parties maintain their power by any means necessary. The Kuomintang was originally a type A political party, but it was greatly influenced by the Soviet Union in 1924 and reorganized into a type B political party. However, Sun Yat-sen still retained a fondness for Anglo-American democracy, so he decided to use political tutelage as a bridge, ultimately transitioning to constitutionalism. The Kuomintang is now moving from a type B political party back towards a type A political party, but the speed still needs to be increased." Today marks the one-year anniversary of Hu's return to the country. When asked about his feelings, Hu replied that returning to the country was like being a primary school student, and he has not yet graduated from primary school.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 5th] Mei Yi-qi, President of Tsinghua University, told reporters: The government's issuance of the Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion can be seen as a demonstration of the government's determination. After the Mobilization Order is issued, it is unclear whether everything will be converted to a wartime system, but in any case, I believe that the government will continue to protect education, as the government never neglected education even during the extremely difficult War of Resistance. This reporter also visited Lu Zhiwei, acting president of Yenching University, who expressed great concern about the current situation and was also concerned about the issue of the Tianjin University campus being occupied.</p>
<p>Resolving the Communist Party Problem</p>
<p>Should Be Approached From Multiple Angles</p>
<p>Wu Yifang's Comments on the Mobilization Order</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's University, spoke to reporters on the 5th about the General Mobilization Order, saying that from the people's standpoint, she has no other opinions. However, the method of resolving the communist army problem should not only be approached from a military perspective, but also simultaneously from the overall economy, politics, people's welfare, and preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism in order to solve the Communist Party problem.</p>

<p>Plans to Wipe Out Scattered Bandits</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nantong, 5th] The First Pacification Zone Command is re-planning to launch a full-scale sweep of scattered bandits in various areas. Local self-defense teams in various counties have also been reorganized and supplemented to cooperate with the National Army's actions.

The people are allowed to report them. People from all walks of life and the entire populace should distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and not be incited by the sweet talk of bandits. They should rise up together to eliminate bandits. Those who have participated in bandit work are allowed to reform. If they remain stubborn, then jade and stone will be burned together. Those from party, league, military, government, and the populace who participate in this suppression and make meritorious contributions will be rewarded.</p>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet expressed anything on this matter. It is generally believed that the Soviet side has not yet responded to our statement regarding Lushun-Dalian. After Molotov returns to the country from Paris, there may be a response. At that time, the Soviet attitude towards China may be clarified.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense did not confirm the Soviet military occupation of Tacheng, only stating that Soviet troops had advanced towards Tacheng in early June, but there have been no further reports.</p>

<p>Implementing Mobilization and Strengthening Military Affairs</p>
<p>Relies on Thoroughly Reforming Politics</p>
<p>Zhang Junmai Discusses the National General Mobilization Proposal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, expressed his opinion on the State Council's passage of the General Mobilization Proposal yesterday, stating that the hoped-for results can only be achieved if politics are thoroughly reformed. Whether strengthening grain administration, conscription, or military strength, a clear and honest government must be the foundation, otherwise it will be difficult to see results. Judging from the current situation in various places, the powers and responsibilities of the central and local governments are unclear, and local administrative expenses and personnel are all subject to central control, to the point that local governments have no possibility of independent action. Taking his hometown of Shishan as an example, there are as many as 36 agencies with the power to direct the county magistrate, so the reform of provincial government is the most urgent task.</p>
<p>People From the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party</p>
<p>Support the General Mobilization Proposal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] After the State Council passed the National General Mobilization Plan on the 4th, Yu Jiaju, Chen Qitian of the China Youth Party, and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party issued their opinions to the press. Yu stated: "We have always believed that the Chinese Communist Party is a violent group with no concept of the nation, and it is fundamentally impossible to cooperate with them to jointly engage in national construction. Therefore, in order to achieve national stability and peace as soon as possible, we should strengthen the military suppression of the communists." Chen Qitian said: "We fully support this important measure of the government." Jiang Yuntian instructed that the General Mobilization Plan should be earnestly implemented, and said, "We strongly support the suppression of the communist rebellion."</p>
<p>The Implementation of the Mobilization Plan</p>
<p>Must Be Fair and Reasonable</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan Offers Three Points</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] When this reporter inquired of Shanghai City Councilor Tao Baichuan about the General Mobilization Plan, he replied: "Regarding the National General Mobilization, I would like to offer three points for consideration:</p>
<p>First, the targets of the General Mobilization are manpower, materials, and financial resources, and its purpose is to truly achieve 'those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength' in order to seek military victory in suppressing the communists and the completion of democratic nation-building. To achieve this goal, we must first focus on organization and control, that is, strengthen the organization and control of the nation's manpower, materials, and financial resources. This is the government's responsibility, so the government must be capable and have the support of the people in order to proceed smoothly. Therefore, improving administrative efficiency and correcting political corruption in order to enhance capability and win the support of the people should be the key to the success or failure of this mobilization, and it is also the issue that the government should pay the most attention to. Because the State Council's proposal did not pay attention to this premise, I am specifically raising it.</p>
<p>Second, given the disorganization of our country's manpower, materials, and financial resources, coupled with the fact that the government's machinery is unsound and it is difficult to expect it to be sound in the short term, in order to achieve the success of the General Mobilization, we must also rely on social forces. Therefore, the government should immediately mobilize social elites to work together. For example, the newly established Social Security Promotion Association in this city will definitely be helpful for the mobilization work in this city in the future, and this can be done in other places as well.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to the above two items, we must also pay attention to fairness and reasonableness in order to achieve the success of the mobilization. If those with strength can avoid contributing strength, while those without strength are forced to contribute strength, and those with money can avoid contributing money, while those without money are forced to contribute money, judging from the current situation, unfortunately, this often happens. Then, not only will the mobilization fail, but it will also drive the fish into the deep, causing them to see the benefit and suffer the harm first. In recent events, the Social Security Promotion Association of this city invited various sectors yesterday to contribute to the Dragon Boat Festival慰勞軍墊款, and of the 92 invitees, 50 people attended and collected more than 2.6 billion yuan, which shows that the people's hearts are still good and things can still be done. However, some rich people simply ignored it. For these rich people, we must continue to urge them to donate in order to conform to the principle of fairness and reasonableness."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] After the State Council passed the General Mobilization Plan, all sectors of the provincial capital expressed their support. More than ten groups, including the Jiangsu Provincial Journalists Association and the Youth Rights Protection and Patriotic Movement, sent a special telegram to the central government on the 5th, vowing to use all their strength to support the government.</p>
<p>Standing Committee of the China Democratic League Expresses</p>
<p>That It Is Not United With the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Standing Committee of the China Democratic League expressed its opinion on the government's passage of the Mobilization Order, stating: If the government can build democracy and unite with educated youth at the present time, the effect will be better than the Mobilization Order. We have always advocated using our country's internal peace to seek world peace. The China Democratic League's position is absolutely neutral and absolutely fair. Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it does not lean towards either side. "If the China Democratic League were to unite with the Chinese Communist Party after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split, it would inevitably create a more divided situation in China," but the China Democratic League has not taken this action. Its past sincere efforts to plan for the country can be made clear to the world. The China Democratic League headquarters is currently located in Nanjing, with Xin Bojun and Luo Longji stationed there for the long term. Luo has gone to Nanjing. Xin is scheduled to go around the 10th of this month. The government has allocated housing, which is very "polite." It is hoped that this kind of courtesy can be extended to all places.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] At 11 AM on the morning of the 5th, the National Army recovered Jiaoxian, an outer stronghold of Qingdao City.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 5th] The center of gravity of the battle situation in Shandong has shifted south to the central area of Meng, Fei, Yi, Ju, and Tangtou, Huandun. The Communist army in that area, totaling eight columns, approximately 180,000 people, has been surrounded separately in four encirclements by the National Army. From the 3rd to the 5th, the truly decisive battles of the main forces are proceeding fiercely.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 5th] After the National Army formally recovered Linqu and Nanma, the two major supply bases of the Communist army in central Shandong, the communist bandits east of Donglidian in Yishui and in the southeastern area of Mengyin fell into a pocket-shaped formation, and the transportation and supply route stretching hundreds of miles from Huimin and Liji on the north bank of the Yellow River to the mountainous area of central Shandong has been cut off. The National Army completely recovered Donglidian at noon on the 5th and then controlled the Yue Zhuang stronghold. Thus, the headquarters of the East China Field Army of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains has been destroyed. At present, another supply line bottleneck in the hands of the communist bandits in Shandong is Zhucheng, east of Yishui.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The Communist army's offensive in western Shandong has begun to falter. The National Army in Yuncheng launched an attack on the morning of the 5th and recovered seven or eight towns and villages, including Gaoyuan northeast of Zoucheng, annihilating more than 1,000 communist soldiers. The National Army in Heze continued to block and attack the Communist army north and northwest of the city on the 5th, annihilating nearly 2,000 communist soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th] Liu Bocheng's communist bandit forces, having forcibly crossed the Yellow River, are fiercely attacking Zoucheng and Yuncheng. Zoucheng has now been captured, while Yuncheng is still in the hands of the National Army. In the area north of Heze, more than 4,000 communist bandits fleeing from Zoucheng were discovered on the morning of the 4th, and more than 3,000 communist bandits fleeing from Yuncheng were discovered. Elite units of the National Army have rushed to block and attack them.</p>
<p>The "Devil King" of No. 76,</p>
<p>Ding Mocun, Executed Yesterday</p>
<p>Pale and Incoherent Before Execution</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The "devil king" of No. 76, traitor Ding Mocun, was executed according to national law at 3:15 PM on the 5th. This executioner, who murdered like a butcher, was already pale and incoherent before the execution. After entering the execution ground, in the last second, he still looked back with cowardice, as if he had endless attachment to the world. With one shot of ten bullets by the bailiff, his despicable life was ended. The sky was dark, the air pressure was extremely low, and thunder rumbled across the sky, forming a magnificent symphony with the enthusiastic applause of the audience at the scene. Heaven and man were both indignant, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>Death Arrives Suddenly Before Afternoon Nap</p>
<p>The execution order for traitor Ding was delivered to the Capital High Court on the morning of the 5th. Supervisor of Execution Prosecutor Chen Shengzu and others arrived at the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison to inspect the execution ground at around 1:40 PM. They then set up a temporary court at around 2:00 PM and signed the order to bring traitor Ding in. When the warrant arrived at the prison, traitor Ding did not know that death was imminent and was still taking his usual afternoon nap with a pillow. Awakened in a daze by the summons, he hurriedly got up, his eyes still sleepy, and walked out of the prison gate. After leaving the prison, he saw a crowd of reporters gathering and taking photos of him. Police officers with guns and live ammunition stood guard strictly. Only then did he realize that his death was imminent, his face changed suddenly, and he frequently looked left and right. His pace also gradually became difficult. Relying on the support of the bailiff, he entered the court.</p>
<p>Excessive Nervousness, Pale Face</p>
<p>Traitor Ding was wearing a light gray old plaid cotton short shirt and pants, black shoes and white socks, and his collar was slightly exposed. His eyes were completely lifeless. His anemic face, due to excessive tension, became even paler, and his lips had no color at all. After standing still, Prosecutor Chen first asked his age and native place. At this time, traitor Ding was already mentally confused and did not seem to hear. He responded vaguely, and the reporter, sitting only three or four steps away from traitor Ding, could only hear a faint "um" sound, which was barely discernible. Prosecutor Chen then informed him of the circumstances of the rejection of the appeal and the rejection of the protest. Traitor Ding listened quietly, swallowing his saliva from time to time. When he heard that he was ordered to be executed today, he clenched his upper and lower teeth, trying hard to support himself. However, due to his excessive tension, he was speechless for a moment, and the atmosphere in the entire court became even more solemn.</p>
<p>Forced Smile, Refuses to Speak</p>
<p>After about 30 seconds, the prosecutor ordered him to speak again and advised him to calm down. Traitor Ding then made a wry smile, first bowed his head and thought for a few seconds, then said in his Hunan accent, "I have no last words!" The bailiff asked him if he had a will. Traitor Ding replied, "It's too late to write one!" Prosecutor Chen said, "You need to calm down a bit. If you don't feel like writing, you can say it orally, and the clerk can write it down for you." Traitor Ding only answered with an "um" sound, not indicating whether he agreed or not, and raised his head to look at the ceiling as if in deep thought. After repeated urging, he lowered his head, smiled bitterly, and replied: "I have nothing to say. It will be difficult for my family after my death. I can only let them be!" Prosecutor Chen said, "The state will make a fair decision regarding your family's living expenses. Now the time has come. Do you have any last words for your wife, children, mother, or friends? Say it quickly! 一</p>
<p>妄女謬論</p>
<p>法官嚴斥</p>
<p>At this point, Ding closed his eyes and thought quietly, for another few seconds. The room was extremely quiet, and only the sound of thunder could be heard outside. After Ding opened his eyes, as if he had seen the light, he frowned and smiled wickedly, first saying: "Regarding the case itself, things have come to this point. I have nothing to say, but I hope that the state can deal with general traitor cases leniently!" Then he repeated it again, and then 獰笑. Prosecutor Chen, upon hearing this, sternly rebuked him, explaining that the area of France is not as large as Sichuan Province in our country, and they have executed 80,000 French traitors, including 7,000 who were sentenced to death. Our country is still lenient towards the Japanese, and it cannot be said that we are not lenient towards traitor cases. After speaking, he asked again if he had any last words for his family and others? Traitor Ding thought hard for a while and still replied: "Nothing!" The prosecutor immediately 令押出. After entering the execution ground, after walking about ten steps, the bailiff told him "Don't move!" Traitor Ding was just turning his head when the gunshot rang out, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his eyebrow. This great traitor fell to the ground in the applause of the audience. His body was curled up in a bow shape, almost reaching his chest, and his feet twitched. He finally died after about two minutes, at 2:17 PM. A reporter rushed forward to take a closer look one minute after the execution. Traitor Ding was lying in a pool of blood, foam was still coming from his mouth, and his face was covered in blood. His hideous face could no longer be distinguished. (Above) Ding Mocun undergoing his final interrogation. (Below) Ding Mocun lying in a pool of blood after his execution. (Photographed by Yu Peiqing of this newspaper)</p>
<p>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau's Austerity Measures for Employees Cause Conflict During Petition</p>
<p>Bureau Chief and Others Injured, Two Others Killed</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 5th] Since the Executive Yuan issued an order to stop subsidies for all state-owned enterprises, Chen Shungeng, Director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, citing the fact that the railway lines under the bureau's jurisdiction have been severely disrupted by the Communist army, resulting in business stagnation and heavy losses, decided on seven measures to disperse employees. More than 1,000 members of the Jinan Branch of the Railway Union went to the bureau to petition on the 4th, and a bloody tragedy occurred due to verbal conflict.

<p>National Assembly Delegate and Legislative Committee Elections</p>
<p>Government Has Absolutely No Intention of Delaying</p>
<p>Hong Lanyou Discusses the Implementation of National Election Affairs Step by Step</p>
<p>[This City Dispatch] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association and member of the Election General Office, came to Shanghai on business. This reporter happened to meet him and asked how the general elections for the National Assembly delegates and legislative committee members would proceed this year, and inquired whether the rumors of delays or the inability to hold them on schedule were true. Hong replied: "The formulation of the constitution, the determination of the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism, and the decision to convene the National Assembly on December 25th of this year to implement constitutionalism were all resolved by the National Assembly last year. This is not only a necessary path to completing democratic politics, but also the common wish of the people of the whole country. Therefore, in terms of legal principles and facts, there is no room for change, and there should be no doubts about the date of constitutional implementation. The government has formulated various constitutional laws and regulations in accordance with the deadlines stipulated in the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism, and at the same time organized the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee to be responsible for promoting constitutional work. Recently, it has also established election agencies in accordance with the law and held meetings of the election committee many times. In yesterday's State Council meeting, President Chiang's proposal also included a command to realize constitutionalism on schedule. This truly shows the government's determination to implement constitutionalism in accordance with the procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism. There is absolutely no consideration of delaying it. There is a portion of the outside world that believes that the areas occupied by the Communist Party's military forces have not yet been recovered, which hinders the election process, resulting in speculation about the government's decision to hold general elections on schedule. They do not know that suppressing the communists and implementing constitutionalism are proceeding in parallel and without contradiction. Implementing constitutionalism is the task of the country to achieve nation-building, and suppressing the communists can eliminate the obstacles to nation-building. Moreover, most areas are now able to conduct elections in accordance with regulations, and the election affairs can be expanded at any time as the bandits are gradually eliminated, and the national election affairs can be completed by implementing them step by step in accordance with the implementation procedures. There is truly no need to doubt it."</p>

<p>"I for Everyone, Everyone for Me" Celebrating International Cooperative Day Mayor Encourages Spirit of Cooperation [Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the 25th International Cooperative Day. Relevant circles in this city held a celebration meeting at 2 PM at the Shanghai Pudong Native Place Association on Zhongzheng Middle Road. Over 200 leaders from various circles, including Mayor Wu, Director Fang, and Director Li of the Social Affairs Bureau, as well as representatives from various cooperative societies, attended. The meeting venue also featured an exhibition of towel products from the Chuansha Nanhui Cooperative Society. The meeting was chaired by Mayor Wu. After performing the formalities, the Mayor delivered a speech, briefly stating that the meaning of cooperation is "I for everyone, everyone for me." If cooperative enterprises can be promoted, corrupt officials and profiteers can be eliminated, and society can be stabilized. Although there are many difficulties in promoting consumer cooperation in Shanghai at present, we must not retreat in the face of difficulties, but must strive to improve cooperation in order to achieve social welfare. Recently, both domestically and internationally, a few people have placed individual interests above national and ethnic interests, or national interests above world interests. Those who disregard the interests of the majority of the people must be overthrown. Whether internationally or domestically, we should uphold justice and seek stability and happiness with a democratic spirit of cooperation. Director Fang then delivered a speech stating that cooperative movement was one of the seven movements promoted by the Party in 1930 and has since achieved considerable results. At this time of economic panic, it is even more necessary to strengthen the cooperative movement. Our country especially needs spiritual cooperation, the so-called "I for everyone," does not necessarily mean "everyone for me," but the Communist Party only seeks "everyone for me" and does not mention cooperation at all, so it must be eliminated. International cooperation should also be based on spiritual cooperation in order to achieve the ideal of Great Harmony. Li Jianhua, Chen Zhongming, and others then gave speeches. After the speeches, the assembly's declaration was read, and a telegram to President Chiang was approved. Finally, entertainment began, and the meeting concluded in joy at around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Four Industries Solve Disputes, Another Wave Rises at Hua Aluminum [Our Newspaper's Report] The Hua Aluminum Steel Refinement Factory, originally scheduled to resume work tomorrow, experienced another setback between labor and management yesterday. The cause was that the factory posted a notice stating: According to actual needs, resumption of work will be carried out in batches, and the half-year bonus will be suspended due to losses from the labor strike. The employees expressed dissatisfaction and sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau again for assistance. The wage dispute at the Iron Printing and Can Making Factory has been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, and a solution has been agreed upon. The matter will be handled after the evaluation committee makes a decision. The labor side of the Rope Making Industry requested improved treatment. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, both parties reached an agreement. The Licha Building previously intended to dismiss 94 employees. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the management has agreed to withdraw the order. The Vegetarian Chefs' Union throughout the city requested that temples pay 30% of the small accounts and restore wages. Yesterday, the General Labor Union mediated. As a result, the temples agreed to all other requests except for the issue of restoring wages, which they believe must be discussed by the Buddhist Association before a response can be given.</p>

<h3>Gold Rush Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 12th Yang Anren and Lin Fengbao Released on Original Bail Zhan Liansheng's Request for Bail Denied and Still Detained [Our Newspaper's Report] The gold speculation case, which caused a sensation in society, was concluded yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Wang Jiazhuo. In addition to the defendants Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng, Li Xiaozhuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the National Bank, and Wang Songtao, former Assistant Manager of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, were summoned as witnesses. After the court hearing, the debate concluded, and the court announced that the case would be sentenced on the 12th of this month. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Judge Wang, accompanied by Clerk Feng Duanxiang, ascended the bench and announced to the defendants that the statutory time limit for the case had been exceeded by 15 days, and the trial would be renewed according to the law. Then, Clerk Feng read aloud the transcript of the examination of witness Li Xiaozhuang on May 24, and then conducted individual interrogations. Wang Songtao testified: "Regarding the remittance situation of Cifengyu after the National Bank allocated gold, because the collection time was too late that day and the time for exchanging bills had passed, it was included in the account on the second day. There were a total of three secret sales, all of which were reported to Yang Anren in advance. From January to February of this year, Cifengyu sometimes sent people to collect the allocated gold, and sometimes Zhan Shusheng came to collect it himself." Lin Fengbao testified: "The bill exchange deadline is 1:00 PM. After 1:00 PM, application forms can be exchanged until 3:00 PM. Because the time was too tight, sometimes there was not enough time to transfer the account. As for the allocation and sale of 600 million yuan of gold on January 16, 700 million yuan of gold on January 30, and as much as 2.5 billion yuan of gold on February 8, it was probably because there were more transactions on Saturdays. At that time, I didn't know it was the last day of gold allocation. I only knew after the order arrived." Yang Anren testified: "On January 27, the National Bank secretly sold 1,820 bars, and another 1,000 bars were sold the next day. As for the delivery the next day, it was because afternoon transactions should be transferred the next day, and the bill exchange time had passed. There was a separate transfer form application. On February 8, the sales reached as much as 2.5338 billion yuan because it was Saturday. The secret sales used intercoms, and Zhan Liansheng represented the association to apply for the open allocation." Zhan Liansheng testified: "Of the 1,820 bars secretly sold by the National Bank, Cifengyu purchased 800 bars on its account. The other 1,000 bars were sold in the afternoon. As for why the most was bought on February 8, I didn't know because I didn't go to the store that day. I was designated by President Bei as the representative for the open allocation of gold. All the matters I handled were traceable and there was no wrongdoing." After the interrogation, the court announced the scheduled sentencing date. The bail for the two defendants, Lin and Yang, remained unchanged, and Zhan Liansheng's request for bail was denied and he was still detained.</h3>

<p>Do Not Regard the Public Works Bureau as a Yamen The Construction Industry Should Cooperate Closely Director Zhao Holds a Talk to Promote the Housing Construction Industry [Our Newspaper's Report] Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, in order to encourage the construction industry in this city, specially convened responsible persons from the Construction Industry Association and various construction companies in the city for talks at the bureau's conference room on the afternoons of the day before yesterday and yesterday.

There are three parties in society responsible for construction undertakings: (1) Competent authorities—responsible for promotion. (2) Schools—responsible for training talents. (3) Construction industry—responsible for execution. Therefore, the construction industry is one of the three pillars, and its importance can be seen from this. The following four points were discussed together during the talks: (1) The Public Works Bureau occasionally discovers construction without permits. It is hoped that no such illegal construction will be discovered in the future. (2) Most of the current building materials do not meet standards, which has a great impact on housing construction. In the future, the Public Works Bureau will strengthen the management of various building materials and will conduct registration work for woodworking operations in order to pre-test Gu Zhong materials. (3) The contract method has to be studied and improved due to the impact of rising prices. The interests of both parties will be taken into account when formulating new methods, and the rights of construction companies will be guaranteed. (4) The Public Works Bureau has tried its best to shorten the time for obtaining permits, and the fastest can be obtained within six days. If there are any deliberate delays, you can report them to the authorities. The atmosphere of the talks was very harmonious.</p>
<p>Two Customs Officers Accused The Case is Being Handled as Slander [Our Newspaper's Report] He Weiku, a super-grade second-class inspector of the Jianghai Customs and Wusong Customs, and Zhu Xiaoliang, a second-class deputy inspector, were secretly reported to the General Administration of Customs by Chen Fengnian, the manager of Chen Fuhua Customs Brokerage at No. 60, Wusong Xing Road, for extorting 6 million yuan by taking advantage of their official duties. The Jianghai Customs sent them to the District Court for trial on special criminal charges of "corruption." The case was tried yesterday in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Wu. According to the defendants' claim: Because they are responsible for inspection and verification, they may offend the customs brokerage. This time, Chen invited Zhu Xiaoliang to go and instructed him to bring a luggage [omitted due to uncertainty] to the clerk of the brokerage on the way back to Shanghai. At that time, he did not suspect anything else and did not open it to see what was inside. Therefore, it was actually a frame-up to avenge private grievances. After the court hearing, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned.</p>

<p>Essays and Miscellany: Seeking Truth Through Nature - Jiang Weiqiao</p>
<p>My late elder brother, Kezhuang, excelled in calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. Therefore, I have enjoyed looking at paintings since childhood, but I cannot create them myself. I always find ways to collect the works of contemporary masters, and I especially love the realistic paintings of Master Yu Jianhua. I remember in the summer of 1932, I planned to travel to Mount Hua, but it was difficult to find companions with the stamina for the journey. Eventually, I went with Master Yu and his disciple Xu Peiji, entering Tongguan, ascending to the summit of Mount Taihua, and traversing dangerous terrains such as Qianchi Dong, Baichi Xia, Canglong Ling, Yaozi Fanshen, and Changkong Zhan. Master Yu, always carrying a plain notebook and inkstone, sketched from life wherever he went. He meticulously depicted strange peaks, bizarre rocks, flying waterfalls, and flowing springs, capturing their essence in detail. He paid particular attention to the ever-changing clouds and the light of dawn and dusk. In three days on Mount Hua, the master and disciple each created several albums of paintings, entitled "Hua Shan Sketches and Travel Records."</p>
<p>I believe that the term "sketches from life" is not entirely appropriate. The name originated with Zhao Chang of the Song Dynasty, who excelled in painting flowers, capturing their natural appearance in the wind and dew. Therefore, he called himself "Zhao Chang, the Sketcher from Life." In modern times, as Western painting spread eastward, any painting that depicted objects from reality, whether figures, flowers, still lifes, or landscapes, was generally called "sketches from life." However, Western painting is called "Sketchers From Nature," which seems more fitting. Chinese landscape painting depicts mountains, ancient trees, and flowing springs, with nothing inherently "alive" about them. In my opinion, it should be renamed "Landscape Painting," while "sketches from life" should refer to paintings of figures and flowers. The word "jing" (scene) was already listed as one of the six essentials by Jing Hao in the Five Dynasties period, and Guo Xi of the Song Dynasty elaborated on it further. Western painting calls landscapes "scenery," so using the term "Landscape Painting" to describe paintings of real-life scenery is appropriate for both Chinese and Western art. I once told Master Yu about this idea, and he quite agreed with me. Now, as Master Yu is about to publicly exhibit his landscape paintings, I write these words to discuss with fellow artists.</p>
<h3>Leonardo da Vinci's Childhood - Xu Fan</h3>
<p>Near the city of Florence in Italy, lies a cluster of Tuscaye mountains embraced by Lake Arno, covered in kudzu vines. Nestled among them is the sleepy village of Vinci. On the rocky peaks surrounding the village stand ancient fortresses and ramparts. Among the vines on the mountains grow silver-gray olive trees. Everywhere, towering cypress trees stand tall, their dark green forms reaching towards the bright Italian sky.</p>
<p>In the early 15th century, a man named Serpiero lived in this small village of Vinci. He was a lawyer, inheriting the profession from his grandfather. No one ever heard of any cases involving him or his family, except in 1452, when Serpiero fathered an illegitimate child, named Leonardo De Vinci.</p>
<p>Almost nothing is known about Leonardo da Vinci's mother. It is said that she was a country girl named Catourir, who raised the beautiful child on her own until he was five years old, when she handed him over to his father, Serpiero. During this time, she married a coarse farmer and lived a life of toil and poverty.</p>
<p>Around the same time as Leonardo's birth, Serpiero also married to secure his family's future. They had no children, so they brought Leonardo into their home as their own. Soon after, his wife died, and Serpiero married a second wife, but still had no children. Therefore, when Leonardo was twenty-five years old, he became his father's only child, and all the family's hopes and warmth were focused on him.</p>
<p>Leonardo was a beautiful child, with a deep love for beauty. He was constantly seeking it out. He loved to watch birds taking flight from the ground or from the surrounding trees, soaring through the bright blue sky. He collected beautiful flowers and carefully studied their structure. His singing voice was sweet and moving, and he could play a six-stringed lute. He admired horses and was able to ride them at a young age.</p>
<p>Regardless, he always listened attentively to his teachers, but his inquisitive mind went far beyond their limited knowledge. A biographer of his early years wrote: "In arithmetic, he often failed to find satisfactory answers, and his teachers were constantly challenged by the difficult theories and explanations he posed."</p>
<p>As a child, Leonardo played in the bright sunshine or under the kudzu vines and olive trees, happily breathing in the fragrance of grapes, wild roses, and almonds. As his legs grew stronger, he went to play by the rivers and lakes, watching the dancing water ripples. Indeed, the water ripples seemed to fascinate Leonardo, and his youthful curiosity drove him to experiment and study these natural changes.</p>
<p>When the young Leonardo's fingers could grasp a pencil or a piece of chalk, he began to draw everything he saw. He drew lakes, cliffs, birds, flowers, and people... Indeed, the interests of some successful painters in their childhood can foreshadow their future, as Serpiero was familiar with many painters.</p>
<p>Once, Serpiero moved to Florence and, upon arrival, was overjoyed to visit his friend Yerocchio. Yerocchio was deeply impressed by the child's early works and warmly welcomed the promising young man to his studio to study. From then on, Leonardo officially entered the world of painting, beginning his great artistic life.</p>
<h3>A Century of Chinese Painting - Lu Danlin</h3>
<p>Is there anything in the universe that remains fixed and unchanging? "Ten years bring many changes in human affairs," everything is constantly in flux. Looking back over the past century, China has undergone dramatic transformations in politics, military affairs, culture, and economics. The changes in art are even more evident. Although the style of Chinese art began to shift after Buddhism entered China, and Western art came in during the late Ming Dynasty with the arrival of Catholicism, Chinese painting was once again greatly influenced by the influx of Western culture and art during the mid-Qing Dynasty. Soon, the maritime ban was lifted, and European and American culture and art flooded in like a raging tide. As a result, China's culture, art, politics, and the lives of its people all experienced tremendous upheaval.</p>
<p>After the rise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing Dynasty's paper tiger was exposed, and internal and external troubles came one after another like a revolving lantern. Although the number of painters did not decrease, the style of painting gradually changed drastically. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, the Qing government became even more corrupt, and many painters sold their works in Shanghai to make a living. Some had to cater to the tastes of customers in order to earn money, and as a result, the quality of their work inevitably declined into vulgarity.</p>
<p>During this period, Ren Xiong and his disciples, although skilled in using the "gouge and outline" technique, could not escape the crude and rough air in their style. They retained only the name of the technique, losing the essence of Huang Quan's style. Wu Changshuo rose up as an unconventional force, incorporating the brushwork of seal script and clerical script into his paintings. Wang Zhen was unrestrained, vigorous, ancient, and profound, full of the spirit of metal and stone, creating a unique style. However, in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, as Western painting gradually spread, several different phenomena occurred in the art world. Roughly speaking, they can be divided into four categories: First, some painters still tried their best to protect the legacy of the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, and Wang Yuanqi), diligently copying and practicing their works. Second, some painters were dissatisfied with the decline of the Four Wangs and sought their own paths, hoping to correct their decadent style. They considered themselves to be shouldering the responsibility of rescuing the endangered. Third, some painters advocated a return to the past, imitating the Song and Yuan dynasties, claiming that this was the only authentic art of the East. Fourth, some painters believed that Chinese painting had gone bankrupt and was not suitable for the modern era. Therefore, they studied Japanese or Western painting to refine Chinese painting, claiming to be integrating Chinese and Western, ancient and modern styles. Some praised the new, some clung to the old, each sect and faction established its own camp, forming a chaotic and disorderly situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the style of Chinese painting over the past century has been very chaotic. On the positive side, it has been constantly changing, improving, discarding dross, absorbing new nutrients, and experimenting in many ways, approaching the new and the international. On the other hand, it has been constantly groping, unsure whether to return to the past or embrace the new, unable to find its own path. This is an undeniable phenomenon. However, in this chaotic and complex art world, there are naturally unique works that are detached and refined, elegant and graceful, beautiful and enchanting, full of charm, powerful and vigorous, with bold and strong brushwork, and possessing a refined spirit and elegant demeanor, each reaching its own exquisite level. The Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum is about to organize a "Century of Painting Exhibition." If they can select some of these works and systematically study the painting styles of the past century and analyze their evolution, it would be of profound significance.</p>
<h3>Inscription on Professor Yu Jianhua's Five-Foot Continuous Huangshan Panoramic View</h3>
<p>(1) Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>I've been to Huangshan five times in three years, but today I'm no longer free;</p>
<p>I cherish every peak and every valley, with thirty-six reasons why.</p>
<p>I haven't been to Huangshan for ten years, my dreams are filled with apes and cranes among the clouds;</p>
<p>The painter adds to my sketch, is my revisiting in old age just a coincidence?</p>
<p>(2) Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Ten years of dreams of Huangshan, today I can enjoy it from my couch;</p>
<p>The old man's brush has a spirit, his ink makes heaven and earth sorrow.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>A vast view from a small boat, the homeland's green hills are most missed;</p>
<p>Awake from wine in a high tower, still enjoying the scenery as if sketching.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>The world-famous strange pines and sea of clouds, are captured in the artist's scroll;</p>
<p>Don't say the new coolness surprises all around, hanging on the four walls, it brings a clear breeze.</p>
<p>(5) Lao Dan</p>
<p>I have been to the foot of Huangshan, but never climbed the Tiandu Peak;</p>
<p>Now I see Jianhua's painting, and believe he has captured the essence of nature.</p>
<h3>Huangshan Panoramic View - Liu Kaiqu</h3>
<h3>Yu Jianhua's Painting Exhibition - Liu Kaiqu</h3>
<p>Master Yu Jianhua is a versatile artist whose love for art can be said to be rooted in heredity and inherent in his nature, especially for the art of modeling. In his early years, he had a wide-ranging study of craftsmanship, patterns, and painting. His book "The Latest Pattern Method" (published by Commercial Press) was the only good book in the Chinese pattern world more than twenty years ago. Later, he gradually focused his attention on painting. He greedily practiced and explored charcoal, watercolor, and oil painting in Western painting; machinery, projection, perspective, and architecture in utensil painting; and finally devoted himself to Chinese painting. In Chinese painting, he painted many landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds, but he focused on landscapes. There are many schools in landscape painting, and although he dabbled in all of them, he focused on sketching from life. He traveled extensively to famous mountains and rivers in China, such as Tiantai, Yandang, Lushan, Wuyi, Taishan, Huangshan, Baiyue, and Jiuhua, all of which bear his sketching footprints. He especially loves Huangshan, and has painted the most of it. Recently, he painted "Huangshan Panoramic View," which can show the entire appearance of Huangshan in front of the viewer, with thousands of rocks and ravines and a myriad of scenes. On the one hand, it fully demonstrates the greatness of Huangshan, and on the other hand, it fully demonstrates Master Yu's profound artistic skills. Some people compare learning to a pyramid, with a broad foundation below and a towering structure above.</p>
<p>With Master Yu's rich artistic knowledge, it is no wonder that he has achieved such great accomplishments, but Master Yu is not old and his energy is strong. His current works cannot be considered the pinnacle of the pyramid. From broad to concise, he continues to conduct in-depth research, and his progress has no end. It is said that the "Huangshan Panoramic View" would take an ordinary painter at least a month to paint, but Master Yu finished it in five days. This ability to write like flying is probably rare even among modern calligraphers!</p>
<p>Now, Master Yu is publicly exhibiting hundreds of his masterpieces created in the rear in recent years. I would like to write a few words to express my admiration.</p>
<h3>Talking About Artists - Shen Yan</h3>
<p>What is an artist? An artist is someone who loves life and is captivated by it. In this respect, he is a man of action, similar to a hero. However, his activity focuses more on the spiritual or dreamlike, distinguishing him from a hero. He does not overcome concrete reality or resist with physical strength; rather, he feels himself in conceptions and images that contain the meaning of life. He has a strong power of expression. He can fantasize about objects, infuse randomly fabricated content with life, and then stimulate himself with this illusory feeling. In this realm of dreamlike emotion, he is a fighter, a victor, and at the same time, an observer. In his expression, the soul of his creation is the goal he strives for, with a sense of command over his magic wand. Behind his excitement, there is a composed mind, an understanding or wisdom that supports his diverse components.</p>
<p>How does an artist grow? Who will write his history of development for us? Why does natural impulse become so introverted? Unless a great poet appears, creating and monitoring his creation, and records the various motivations or internal situations of the conception and production of his creation, unadorned, for himself and the world, we will probably not get a complete answer to these questions.</p>
<h3>Words on Music - Ning Xuren</h3>
<p>Music is the best art, better than anything else at aiding human peace. Where there is beautiful music, it is difficult to be dissatisfied with life. - (Herbert Spencer)</p>
<p>Music is irresistible, its power is boundless; it guides benevolent emotions, peace, and love. - (Thackeray)</p>
<h3>Schubert</h3>
<p>Schubert was once hailed as Beethoven's successor, but he lived an extremely impoverished life. He composed a large number of songs, such as "Hark, Hark, the Lark" and "Ave Maria," which are sung by music lovers. His Eighth Symphony was never finished. This is the famous "Unfinished Symphony," and this piece is like this.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood - Ye Jingfeng</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding is so ill that, let alone me, a stranger, being able to extract any information from him about that group, I fear even his own parents, wife, and children would not be recognized if they stood before him.</p>
<p>"This is precisely one of the key leads I need to explore. A series of important secrets can be found on him!" I spoke truthfully, but feigned anger, complaining to the head of the Japanese special agents, and urging him to order the relevant officials to send Mr. Ding to the hospital. They agreed to send Mr. Ding to the temporary rear hospital for treatment. I said, "The facilities there are incomplete. It would be better to send him to a municipal or private hospital; I have other uses for him." They said that if the "Jiao" had confirmed, it could be done.</p>
<p>According to the doctor's diagnosis, Mr. Ding's condition was not just a common wound inflammation, nor just the result of beatings and electric shocks, and various nerve stimuli, but was somewhat like acute tuberculous meningitis and oral inflammation occurring simultaneously. If it were simply acute tuberculous meningitis, intermittent periods of clarity would quickly follow spinal tap and injection. Unfortunately, the wounds were severe, and he had suffered non-judicial torture. His life was hopeless, and even intermittent moments of clarity and clear thinking were impossible.</p>
<p>Of course, I was disappointed. But for the sake of the group's information and Mr. Ding's life, I asked the doctor to make every effort to save Mr. Ding's life. However, the doctor said that if his diagnosis was correct, even if he were sent to the largest and most complete hospital in the United States, not to mention the small place of Tianjin, China, Mr. Ding's life would only have a chance of one in four hundred thousand! In other words, out of every four hundred thousand people, perhaps one could be saved, and he would have to be healthy and have strong resistance on a normal day.</p>
<p>As expected, after the doctor performed spinal tap, examination, injection, and other procedures, this patriotic man, who had been wounded, tortured, and inhumanely tormented, became heavier and heavier by the minute. His two arms were constantly making rhythmic movements - writing, aiming, firing a gun, sending telegrams, etc. - these were probably the important tasks he usually performed, and had become subconscious habits, replaying and cycling endlessly in a state of high fever and delirium. In addition, every now and then, his lips trembled, and his hoarse vocal cords emitted one or two syllables. I listened carefully and quietly, and discerned several words from the blurred sounds, which, like the habitual gestures, were also rhythmically repeated in a cycle - hit, do, quick, be careful,... come on!</p>
<p>"Come on," I understood the last two syllables clearly, but I couldn't guess their meaning; they didn't sound like a password, nor did they sound like calling someone's name. Later, in a family letter in Mr. Ding's file in the Japanese intelligence department, it was found that Mr. Ding's wife's name was "Lian," and his only three-year-old daughter's name was "Xiao Lian"; only then did I realize that the two words "Come on" were perhaps "Lian," or "Yun Yun Lai"!</p>
<p>More than forty hours later, although the doctor had done his best to fulfill his responsibilities, Mr. Ding finally sighed his last breath and passed away.</p>
<h3>Sunday Chat: Pearson Innocent - Hai Feng</h3>
<p>First, let me introduce a telegram from Tokyo three days ago:</p>
<p>"James, a nineteen-year-old American soldier, raped the wife of a local shipowner, and was sentenced to death by a military court after three days."</p>
<p>What about Pearson, the American soldier who was involved in the case of raping Shen Chong, a student at Peking University, half a year ago?</p>
<p>Let us explain the development of this situation with the news of the past week.</p>
<p>Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, expressed disappointment in Beijing on June 20 regarding the fact that the US Navy Department's military judge advocate general was going to drop the charges against Pearson. He said:</p>
<p>"I was present at the trial of Pearson and, based on all the evidence, the defendant should be convicted of rape... He expressed his views on the incident with a very solemn attitude:</p>
<p>"All of China is closely watching the test of the dignity of American law."</p>
<p>This is a view that can represent all the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Let's look at the reactions from various parties:</p>
<p>(1) The Joint Student Union of Peking University has expressed its attitude towards Pearson's acquittal.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to inquire with the US about the US authorities' cancellation of the verdict against Pearson, who raped a Chinese female student, and to request the US side, through Ambassador Stuart, to maintain the original verdict of the US military court in Beiping against the perpetrator. (Note: The original verdict found Pearson guilty of rape and sentenced him to fifteen years of penal servitude.)</p>
<p>(3) Until June 30, when Ambassador Stuart answered questions at Yenching University, he gave the following answer:</p>
<p>Question: In the case of the rape of Chinese female student Shen Chong by American soldiers in Beiping, the principal offender Pearson was declared innocent in the United States. What is the ambassador's view?</p>
<p>Answer: I sent a telegram yesterday to inquire, and the telegram said that the case has not yet been pronounced, and the US Navy's highest authorities are still investigating.</p>
<p>But what is the basis for the rumor of an acquittal?</p>
<p>According to our speculation, the US Attorney General has already made a decision to drop the charges against Pearson, and now only awaits the approval of the US Secretary of the Navy. Therefore, when Ambassador Stuart answered reporters, he also said: "The US Navy's highest authorities are still investigating," which shows that, based on the current situation, there is a good chance that Pearson's conviction will be overturned.</p>
<p>But the United States is a country ruled by law, and it will take this case, which is related to the friendship and diplomatic relations between the two countries, very seriously.</p>
<h3>Free Talk: Mrs. Shaw - Peeking Through a Tube</h3>
<p>The nearly centenarian literary giant George Bernard Shaw was able to achieve his present success largely thanks to his virtuous helpmate. Due to her gentle and kind nature and attitude, and her superior organizational and managerial abilities, she constantly gave Shaw encouragement and prevented him from worrying about household matters. She arranged a tranquil and artistic environment for him, allowing him to focus on his writing.</p>
<p>Shaw's wife was Miss Payne-Townshend, an idealist and practitioner of social reform. She had a strong sense of social service, so she enthusiastically participated in all social reform gatherings and activities, abandoned all vanity, and avoided opportunities to stand out as much as possible. Therefore, it was difficult to find her name and traces in newspapers and places that could attract public attention.</p>
<p>When she met and befriended Shaw, he was still an unknown figure, one of the many journalists constantly rushing around. However, with her unique insight, she already respected his talent and character. Once, Shaw suffered an unexpected injury and was on the verge of succumbing to illness. Thanks to her devoted care, he gradually recovered. Shaw was moved by her deep friendship and married her in 1898. Because of her diligent encouragement and comfort, he abandoned his journalistic career and devoted himself to literary creation.</p>
<p>Shaw was already a middle-aged man of forty-two when he married his wife. His wedding with his wife was a joke, and Shaw still couldn't help laughing when he first mentioned it. It is said that their wedding was scheduled to be held at the registry office. He had invited two friends to be witnesses in advance, one of whom was the very famous social philosopher Wallace. These two witnesses, who already had considerable social status, were naturally dressed several times better than the groom. At that time, Shaw searched his wardrobe but could not find an outfit that was good enough. As a result, although he was happily busy with entertaining guests, the registrar who presided over the wedding did not pay attention to him, thinking that his attire was not suitable for a groom. When the wedding was about to begin, the registrar mistakenly paired Miss Payne-Townshend with the well-dressed Mr. Wallace. Although this mistake was immediately corrected, the scene at the time was funny enough.</p>
<p>Shaw's wife was not only a charming and approachable woman, but also a talented writer, possessing the same sense of humor as Shaw. However, she was overshadowed by her famous husband's talent. Her literary attainments were very high, and it is undeniable that she made indelible contributions to English literature, such as her tireless and dedicated work in translation. She introduced as many plays as possible by the famous French playwright Brieux to England. Her love and admiration for Brieux's plays were not consistent with Shaw's earlier love for Ibsen's plays. However, she remained convinced of Brieux throughout her life.</p>
<p>She was an extremely courageous and determined woman who criticized the shortcomings of modern civilization and offered questions that had been regarded as settled throughout the ages, but were actually wrong. She was one of the most dedicated people in seeking social reform. Her translations of Brieux's plays were fluent and clear, because Brieux's plays also had the same value for British society, so she tried every means to persuade the censorship committee to allow Brieux's plays to be performed in England. She herself was also an executive member of the British Stage Association. After her efforts, she finally managed to convince those stubborn people and achieve victory.</p>
<h3>Crane Soaring to the Sky - Hulu</h3>
<p>Prices</p>
<p>Fly in a straight line. Reach a peak, like a sudden convulsion, but encounter a slow doctor, medicine thrown in vain!</p>
<p>Suffering enough, difficult to complain, who cares about the lives of the poor? Rice exceeds the 500,000 yuan mark, every grain a tear drop!</p>
<h3>Known Too Late - Gong Tao</h3>
<p>A person went to see a doctor because his eyes were swollen and his ears were ringing. The first doctor told him that it was a problem with his tonsils and that they should be removed, but after the operation, his condition remained the same. He went to see another doctor. This doctor suggested that he have all his teeth extracted, but afterwards, his eyes were still swollen and his ears were still ringing. So he had to consult another doctor. This doctor, after examining him, told him very frankly: "This is an incurable disease, you only have six months to live!"</p>
<p>So he decided to enjoy himself before he died. He bought a new car and made dozens of new clothes. One day he went to a shop to order shirts. The tailor took his measurements and said, "Sleeves, three feet four inches, collar, sixteen inches."</p>
<p>"Why sixteen inches? I've always worn a fifteen-inch collar."</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the tailor. "I must warn you, if you continue to wear a fifteen-inch collar, your eyes will swell and your ears will ring."</p>
<h3>The Secret of Praise</h3>
<p>If you want to praise someone, you should praise him more specifically. If you want to praise someone's home, avoid simply saying, "Your home is really nice!" Choose more special places, such as the scenery outside, the interior furnishings, etc. Do not just praise a woman's hat: "It suits you very well," think of a new angle and color to praise her with.</p>
<h3>Jasmine - Xu Ren</h3>
<p>The jasmine belongs to woody plants, which like warmth and fear cold. The second and third months of spring are the time to plant it. Cut off the old branches, making them into sections about four or five inches long, plant them in the soil, and cover them with fine sand. They will germinate in about ten days, poking their heads out of the sand. Then, dig good mud ridges in the garden, gather a dozen jasmine sprouts into a clump, and transplant them into the mud ridges, leaving some distance between each clump. By the early summer of the second year, the jasmine will begin to bud, and each clump will produce twenty or thirty beautiful flowers. It stops flowering in September of the lunar calendar. At this time, it is covered with straw to keep it warm and overwinter. In the second spring it can be planted again.</p>
<p>There are foreign, native, single petal, and double petal varieties of jasmine. The double petal variety is the most precious. The color is whiter than other varieties, and the aroma is more intense. The flowers can last for three or four days without wilting, and the petals overlap into five petals, like the shape of a lotus flower.</p>
<p>In addition to decoration, jasmine can also be used to fumigate tea and make jasmine scented tea with tea leaves, which has a good color and aroma. This is a special product exported from Fujian. Therefore, many villagers and farmers rely on growing jasmine flowers for their livelihood. So it is difficult to see jasmine planted in clay pots in Fujian, but rather dozens or even hundreds of hectares of jasmine gardens in the fields. Walking among them, one can see an endless sea of ​​snow-white flowers, which is a spectacle. On summer evenings, a clear breeze blows from the flower clusters, carrying a strong fragrance.</p>
<p>In this scarlet summer, not only should clothes be white, but any object that is white gives people a cool and refreshing feeling. Flowers are loved by people, and the creator specially opens some pure white flowers for people in the summer. So jasmine, magnolia, and other flowers have become people's favorite flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Among all the fresh flowers, jasmine is the most intimate with women. Twenty years ago, most women had not cut their hair, and everyone was fighting to dress up their hair. In summer, the women liked to use tender copper wire to string the jasmine flower at the base, and put many flowers together to make an arc-shaped garland, or other delicate shapes, around the delicate hair bun. Young girls also used copper wire to thread jasmine flowers into butterfly and full moon shapes, and hang them on the lapel or chest. But later, women cut their hair, and there was no longer a hair bun that could surround jasmine flowers. As for the fashion of hanging jasmine on the chest, it has long passed. Jasmine flowers can no longer get close to the fragrance and skin of women's hair, which should be the sadness of jasmine flowers.</p>
<h3>Voices from the Old World - Li Zhen</h3>
<p>"Horror Film" "Web of Deceit"</p>
<p>Adapted from the stage play "Bowing and Submitting," "Web of Deceit" is clearly a social drama. Because the director failed to grasp the keynote of the play, Zhao Futang's murder of his nephew seemed extremely unreasonable.</p>
<p>The clever director only paid attention to the "horror" scenes, but the "horror" atmosphere still could not cover up the unrealistic and distorted subject matter.</p>
<p>Qiao Qi's Zhao Futang has a better performance, but it is a bit too tense, a bit too much; Huai Jin's performance in the first half of the play is still stable, but the section before her departure in the second half of the play suddenly changed its tone. Su Manyi's social butterfly can't even recite the lines, let alone talk about other movements and expressions.</p>
<p>The recording of this play, however, has achieved particularly good results.</p>
<p>"How Cruel Fate"</p>
<p>In this film, the playwright forced some "fatalistic" ideas on the audience, writing all the university students as pitiful insects, especially the "cruel fate" woman Zhou Yuqing. She was controlled by others everywhere, she dared not resist, nor did she want to resist, she was bullied and humiliated, and she believed in fate in everything. This is enough to satirize the shortsightedness of the directors.</p>
<p>The times are advancing, and the voices of the corrupt, outdated, old world can only hide in the darkness and emit their stench.</p>
<p>Wang Xichun's Zhou Yuqing is stable and competent, Xu Li's emotions are too intense, and the play is always in motion. Guo Ping's Zhu Wanjun, the character itself is not unified, and the performance also lacks inner emotion.</p>
<p>This film, directing and technically, has nothing to commend.</p>
<p>"A Warrior's Spring Dream"</p>
<p>British films have their own unique style, delicate and lifelike, without the impetuous emotions of American films. This "A Warrior's Spring Dream" depicts the life story of British officer Clive Caine, his friendships, love affairs, duels, hunting, military service, and all other life events, using these events to string together his life's work. Undoubtedly this is a biopic. It is worth mentioning that the actor who plays the male lead Clive Caine, Lao Lifuli, portrays three periods from youth to middle age to old age, with significantly different performances. Especially the Clive Caine in his old age, has an unforgettable impression.</p>
<p>The director handles the whole film in a simple and unadorned manner, clear and moving, and several repeated contrasts show his intelligence.</p>
<p>"Dewdrop Peony"</p>
<p>Unlike those pornographic sentences used in the advertisements, this play has accurate and vivid content. It describes the process experienced by a girl engaged in dancing arts throughout her life, striving to dedicate her entire life to art, and also gaining an eternally glorious life in art.</p>
<p>Under the director's delicate handling, this is a deeply moving good film. Loretta Young has a particularly good harvest. Kang Leiweide, who plays the dancer Rou Xing, is the most sophisticated and accomplished of the male actors.</p>
<p>Two Song and Dance Films</p>
<p>"Peach and Plum Competing for Fragrance" and "The Moon is Especially Bright in Mid-Autumn Festival", the former is better than the latter, especially the story of "Peach and Plum Competing for Fragrance" is written in a more casual manner, and the arrangements for many singing scenes are also more reasonable and appropriate. "The Moon is Especially Bright in Mid-Autumn Festival" appears to be more empty as a whole, and the performance is also much worse.</p>
<p>Other films such as "Blood Bandit Commando" and "Adventures in New York" and "Sea of People" can only be regarded as third and fourth-rate films. Apart from the exciting opening scenes, there is nothing more to ask for in terms of film art.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Clarifies the Significance of Mobilization: Concentrating Efforts on Construction, Inviting Relevant Leaders to Discuss Implementation Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The General Mobilization Act, passed by the State Council on the 4th, was delivered to the Executive Yuan at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, making it a rare instance of a State Council resolution being delivered to the Executive Yuan so quickly. Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, convened relevant department heads at the Executive Yuan from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the 5th to conduct preliminary discussions on the implementation methods of the plan. The heads of various departments are also drafting proposals for the work of their respective departments, which may be discussed at the political affairs meeting on the 8th. After the public announcement of the capital's political atmosphere and the mobilization plan, it has clearly turned from depression to anticipation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, made a statement on the 5th as the National Government's General Mobilization Order is about to be implemented. The original words are as follows:</p>
<p>This Yuan received yesterday the National Government's instruction to vigorously implement national general mobilization, eliminate obstacles to democracy, and implement the policy of peaceful national reconstruction. This is a major measure taken by the government to strengthen the national reconstruction process. The reasons why the country has no choice but to mobilize for suppressing the rebellion today have been detailed in the full text of the Chairman's proposal. At the beginning of the implementation, I would like to reiterate its significance and explain the understanding and efforts that all the people and officials and soldiers of the country should have in the future, in order to encourage them.</p>
<p>China was originally a poor and weak country. As a result of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the country's vitality has become increasingly depleted, and the people's lives have become increasingly difficult. It was hoped that after the victory, we would quickly engage in construction, making politics democratic and the economy industrialized. Unfortunately, during the war of resistance, the Chinese Communist Party took advantage of the country's difficulties to accumulate strength. After the victory, it became an internal obstacle to national reconstruction. The government's peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, and the continuous efforts of General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, friends of the United States, to mediate could not reverse the Communist Party's ambition to seize power by violence. After the reorganization of the government, I still expressed hope that effective military measures could be taken to quickly achieve the goal of resolving domestic disputes and restoring unity through political means. Unfortunately, in the past two months or so, the Communist Party's arrogance has become even more rampant, the rebellion has become more widespread, and it has once again rejected the National Senate's proposal to resume peace talks. The above facts are all seen and heard by the people of the country.</p>
<p>Recalling that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the government was working hard to reorganize the army, resettle refugees, prepare for democratic constitutionalism, protect the people's freedom and rights, and restore and build the economy, but the Communist bandits went in the opposite direction, trying their best to expand the army and expand the rebellion. They spared no effort to destroy public and private property and violate the lives and freedom of the people. The government's cumulative construction cannot match the Communist bandits' vicious destruction. If such rampant ferocity and atrocities are not quickly suppressed, the country and the nation will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, the government has no choice but to act resolutely to comfort the people and save the country out of concern for the country.</p>
<p>The significance of general mobilization is to concentrate the will and strength of the whole country to eliminate obstacles to national reconstruction on the one hand and to raise the awareness of the whole people to engage in political and economic construction work to the best of their ability and as far as the situation allows. In this regard, the people of the whole country must have a fundamental understanding that this is a struggle between the forces of construction and destruction in China, a struggle between democratic forces and anti-democratic forces, and the key to China's rise and fall. China's construction still needs to go through this stage, which was not expected at the beginning, but since the situation is inevitable, we must gather the strength of the whole country to overcome this difficulty. We seek unity through suppressing the rebellion and seek rejuvenation through hard work. The more firm our will and the more concentrated our strength, the shorter this difficult process can be.</p>
<p>Because the significance of general mobilization is not only to passively suppress the rebellion, but also to actively build. The government is currently carrying out constitutional preparations, and the implementation period is not far away. In order to cultivate the spirit of constitutionalism, special attention should still be paid to the protection of the people's basic rights, but the people's rights are based on the stability and unity of the country. Now that the country is striving for stability and unity, the people of the whole country must place the interests of the country and the nation above their personal interests. The government should respect the people's freedom and rights as much as possible, and the people should also respect the law, cherish order, and strengthen their sense of responsibility to the country. Only in this way can the situation of stability and unity be quickly restored in the present, and in the future it will be the real foundation of democratic constitutionalism. From the perspective of government personnel, during the general mobilization period, the affairs of government personnel are intensified and their responsibilities are increased. Therefore, they must first seek their own soundness in order to quickly and effectively mobilize the power of the people. In this regard, we must strengthen our attention to the use of politics and political discipline.</p>
<p>In the use of politics, we must first pay attention to the tightness and flexibility of the vertical and horizontal relations. In the vertical direction, it is necessary to ensure that every law and decree is implemented from the upper level to the grassroots level without delay, distortion, or perfunctoriness. In the horizontal direction, agencies and departments within agencies should cooperate with each other, with clear responsibilities, without overstepping authority or shirking responsibility. Government officials should especially establish credibility with the people and obtain their cooperation. Only in this way can every law and decree be implemented universally and meet the requirements of the country. In terms of political atmosphere and discipline, corruption must be eradicated and the spirit of upholding the law must be established. During the mobilization period, the power of political control is more universal and profound. If the integrity of the executors is not strictly observed, it will be enough to hinder the implementation of government orders, damage the government's reputation, and arouse the people's doubts. Therefore, government personnel and national army generals and soldiers must be especially strict in regulating themselves and supervising their subordinates. If anyone takes advantage of their position to seek personal gain, engage in corruption, abuse their power, arbitrarily violate the law, infringe on the people's rights, or evade responsibility, conceal chaos, or condone bandits, they will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. In particular, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will report corrupt, fraudulent, and troublemaking officials and soldiers who condone bandits as much as possible to assist the government in monitoring areas that its power cannot reach, so as to achieve the effect of rectifying political and military discipline. Reviewing the history of the Chinese National Revolution, for more than 50 years, although China has suffered many internal and external troubles, the process of national construction has never been reversed. The rising Chinese nation, its rejuvenation, cannot be hindered by any reactionary force. Now that the government has made the determination to seek unity through suppressing the rebellion and to seek rejuvenation through hard work, it is hoped that compatriots across the country will support the government's national policy, contribute all their strength, and fight together.</p>
