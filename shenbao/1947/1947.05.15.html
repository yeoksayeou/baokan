<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕關於外傳參政會中自由份子將於大會期間發動和平運動一事，新聞局長董顯光十四日在記者招待會中宣稱，截至目前爲止，參政會秘書處並未收到任何有關所謂和平運動之提案。至關於促成和平團結之任何合理建議，政府從未拒絕考慮，惟過去經騐，甚使政府失望，故侈言和平實無補於現局。政府之對於完成統一民主所取之途徑，絕不有所改變。又許德珩等三參政員函請邵秘書長派機往迎共黨參政員來京，參加本屆參政會一事，業經邵氏函復，如彼等有意來京，自易辦理。茲誌邵氏復許德珩，周炳琳，錢端升三參政員函如次：「六日賜書，昨午奉悉。中共參政員開會通知，經電請中共在行總工作之伍雲甫君轉達，倘得復，則先生等派機往迎之議，自易遵辦；但鑒於中共近年對參政會之態度與本年一月拒絕張文伯將軍赴延安之舉，恐難有良好之反應，更慮其又指此議爲和平攻勢，而加以笑駡，則或非徒無益矣！弟甚佩先生等之熟誠高見，當遵與政府詳商，仍盼早日命駕來京，俾得隨時請示，即頌道安，弟邵力子叩。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕行政院新聞局十四日下午四時半舉行記者招待會，董局長顯光答覆記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，政府對於民主同盟之態　如何？</p>
<p>答，民主同盟與中共，曾公開否認憲法及國民大會之合法性，該盟與反叛政府之中共旣有密切關係，雖仍宣稱係一和平之政黨，然政府對該盟之態度。將視其政策及行動如何而定。　問，中國有多少政黨，亦即除參加政治協商會議者外，尙有多少說黨？並未參加政協而爲政府所承認之政黨計有多少？並未參加政協之政黨得參加競選否？</p>
<p>答，目前除參加政協之政黨外，尙有若干政黨亦有活動，惟其確數甚難斷定。凡屬中華民國公民，俱得依照選舉法之規定，參與鼓選，並非必須由各黨派推舉候選人。</p>
<p>新疆情勢無變化　未聞更易省主席</p>
<p>問，新疆目前之情勢如何？該省駐有中央軍多少，據傳張治中主席即將更調是否屬實？</p>
<p>答，新疆情勢並無變化，本人未悉中央有更調張主席之意。　問，據傳張學良氏在不久之將來或可釋放，此說確實否？　答，關於張學良氏並無新消息可以奉吿。。</p>
<p>問，李璜氏對於接受或拒絕經濟部長之職有無確切答覆？</p>
<p>答，政府尙未接得李璜氏關於其接受或拒絕經濟部長之確切答覆。</p>
<p>問，關於解凍生活指數已有定策否？</p>
<p>答，此項問題政府尙在研究中。</p>
<p>問。自戰事結束以來曾否以外匯撥給各大學作購買圖書儀器之用，如有撥給，數量多少？三民主義靑年國之經費從何而來？</p>
<p>答。關於劃撥外匯補助各大學充實岡書儀器設備一節，二十九年在美國租借法案內撥美金二十萬元，三十年在美國信用貸款內，撥美金八十萬元，惟因交通困難，迄未購運完畢，三十五年又撥外匯五十萬元分配各校，惟因緊急經濟措施辦法之頒行，迄猶未撥發，同年又向聯總申請補助因戰事受損失之農工醫各院校儀器，計美金四百萬元，正派人赴美洽購商運，卅六年敎育經費項下又列外匯八十萬美元，正在分配中。靑年團經費本年度已不列在國家總預算內開支，此後黨團經費皆已自籌，不復由政府負祖。又有詢以最近山東戰事情况者，費局長答謂，政府對山東戰局最近進展引爲滿意。</p>

<h3>英美與蘇新糾紛　將因對日和約問題引起　美否認與他國間有商談</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日合衆電〕國務院發言人於答覆有關外傳英美正商談對日和約事之問題時稱，美國並未與任何其他國家商談此問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕據華盛頓郵報本日訊，對日和約之起草與談判，將不經過外長會議美英已決定單獨打破四强草擬歐洲和約之舊例，馬歇爾認爲其他曾與日本作戰之明國，必須參加締約之過程，如可能時，應自初擬條約時開始。貝文在莫斯科會議時，亦贊成上項結論，此種意見，係加拿大及澳洲一再反對四强或五强　斷最初階段內條約談判之結果。貝氏並曾向各自治領保證歐洲和約之程序將不在遠東重現。據該報訊：馬歇爾刻正研究可能之機構，俾於對日和約中代替外長會議，唯此點現尙未獲得決定。郵報聲明：「自各種徵象觀之，十一國家組成之遠東委員會，似將爲起草對日和約之機構，或至少以此爲模型之機構，英美對於日和約之意見，似必將與蘇聯引起新糾紛，因蘇聯無疑將反對十一國家均參加草擬條約之主要過程。」該報稱：英美將直截拒絕上述各國被於擯於締結和約進程之外。</p>
<h3>滬星綫海洋輪　經營失策　僑胞失望</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡十三日電〕海外僑胞所熱心渴望搭乘本國船隻返國之願望，頃因遠洋輪船貿易公司之經營失策而吿毀滅。蓋該公司曾派遺其第一艘船隻「海洋」號，往返於新加坡與上海間，（中途經厦門香港及曼谷，該公司係新近在上海成立，其資本全數屬於華人，在新加坡曾設一分公司，華僑對該公司之消息，深寄注意，甚多華僑爲欲搭乘該公司之新輪起見，甚且放棄搭乘他國輪隻之機會，該公司之船隻雖已數次更改抵達日期，惟彼等仍耐性等待，毫無怨言，其船累且於船到前，即行預售。然事實之表現，與華僑之願望，完全相反，第一，該輪之建造，原係準備在寒冷地帶行駛，故其頭等艙特設於機器房四週，此對在熱帶地區行駛，似嫌太熟。第二，水量供應不足，衛生設備甚差，毫無硏適可言。第三，公司當局僅知賺錢，而不顯旅客之舒適與安全。該輪正式僅可搭乘旅客三百位，惟公司售出之票數，竟超出千張，公司爲避免進入香港麻煩起見，甚且命令輪船先在厦門停舶，俾大量旅客上岸後，再駛返香港，以避免麻煩手續。惟此項計劃，未爲新加坡當局所准許，故該輪原定十日離此，亦未遭准許，刻此事仍在磋商中，而開船期遂亦未決定，華僑均感悲憤，本地報紙亦激烈抨擊公司當局之處理失當。此事非僅對公司營業係一打擊，且足减低華僑對國人經營船隻之信心。</p>

<h3>湘省邵陽城內發生　毒殺刦燒慘案　專署秘書涉嫌重大</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙十二日電〕邵陽近發生一空前毒殺刦燒慘案，湘大區專員公署秘書傅德明，有刦財滅口重大嫌疑，轟動全省。該縣城內東直街永和金號，於本月四日晨五時許，忽吿火警，比經救滅，發現該店首進舖房內四人中毒，一人被殺身死，中進火塲中遺屍一具，焦灼難辨，後進三人中毒。後經查覺，被殺者係店員饒文淸，被創十四刀，血肉糢糊，燒斃者係店徒金海水，中毒店員醫治淸醒後，據供：本月三日晚九時許，專署傅秘書來店，旋即緊閉店門，出示專員手令一紙，上書「永和金店人員一律到案」字樣，繼出藥丸一包，書曰「眞言丸」三字，逼令諸人各服十粒，衆懼於威，僅管事饒文清未服，餘均吞服昏倒，不省人事，此後起火殺人各情，概不知悉。緣該店經理田瑞卿，月前被誣有共黨嫌疑，經專署執解省方偵訊後，旋即獲釋，在此期間，有人曾威脅該店，意圖詐索，經店員以店主不在爲詞，未遂所欲，卒至演成慘案，或係歹徒出以縱火刦財毒殺滅口之最後手段。案發後，六區專員孫佐齊態度曖昧，言辭褊袒傳某，至今亦未積極進行破案，地方紳商羣情憤懣，組織後援會，呼籲速懲元兇，爲死者雪寃，該縣地方法院，以傅嫌疑確屬重大，日前已予拘押鞫訊，長市各報速日著論，表示憤慨，一致主張澈查嚴辦，以肅紀綱，安定人心，湘省府已派大員前往澈查。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>配米法改善以後</h3>
<p>本市改善配米的對策，如今已算確定：卽一面取消限價，並取消拋售，以恢復米糧之自由買賣；一面實施局部配給，限價限額，以求民生之安定。這兩個辦法同時實行，其便有四：（一）疎暢來源，不至以產銷價格距離太遠之故，而使米商束手；（二）自然調節，米商更不患無合法之利潤可圖；（三）以有配給米相牽制，自由米市塲中，無形中亦可收相當緩和之效；（四）縱使米市偶然反常，一般工廠職工，公敎人員，以及學生和勞苦大衆，皆有平價配給米可領，亦不至發生恐慌。所以在公米未充，未能辦到全面配給以前，這種措置，不能不說是差强人意。</p>
<p>現在職工與敎職員生的配給辦法，已經正式公布；貧民如何配米，尙在籌擬準備之中。依據過去各地辦理平糶的經騐，與去年社會局辦理平價粉的情形，有幾點値得向當局和大衆一提。</p>
<p>一·所謂貧民的標準，必須明白確定，使調查者和請求者易於遵循。</p>
<p>二·調查手續，不得不賴各區保甲人負，分頭負責；務期任勞任怨，毋漏毋濫，使眞正貧民共沾實惠。</p>
<p>三·貧民册及平米票，必須調製得相當精密，以便稽查而杜胃濫。</p>
<p>四·發米地點和時間，必須有適當的配合，庶秩序易於維持，而大衆可省奔波之勞。</p>
<p>五·最理想的辦法，是另設平糶地點，由自治人員幫同辦理；以便劃淸界限。如委托米號辦理，其時間必須明白規定，在規定時間以內，暫定自由買賣，免滋誤會。</p>
<p>六·樣米，米價，時日，地段，尤須一一陳列或標明，俾衆周知。</p>
<p>七·秩序和稽察方面，應由各區警局和保甲共同負責，以資周密。</p>
<p>最要緊的是時日要準確，手續要簡明，秩序要整齊。過去辦理平糶，每每發生事故，其原因罔不由此。可知要求結果之圓滿，一面需要準備之周到，一面仍須有關各機構之合作，和大衆之遵守秩序。</p>
<p>至淤自由米市，旣經當局取消限價，和產區地方政府允許自由流通，自可公平買賣，恢復正常之狀態。但爲促進流通，增加來源起見，我們認爲尙有兩事値得商討。</p>
<p>第一關於採購瞪和許可制的商榷米糧並非達禁品，旣許自由採辦，何以尙須請領採購證？又何以仍須當地政府騐明許可？這些不必要的手續，不是可以一概省略的嗎？有人以爲領取採購證，可以避免許多留難和麻煩；於事實上是不無裨益的。我們也知道，這話的確是事實；而且領了採購證，有時仍免不掉留難和麻煩。這可證明自由流通這一點，事實上尙未完全做到：不得不希望各地方政府恪遵政令，切實改善了。</p>
<p>第二關於囤米和辦米的問題本市人口衆多，而供應時虞不濟，事實上有獎勵辦米之必要。記得過去對淤辦米來滬，市府曾定有種種獎勵辦法。到如今，也還沒有明令取消。那末，對於辦米來滬一點，至少可以悉聽自由，不必問他是否米商。因爲依照取締囤積居奇辦法第三條之規定，也只取締業外人大量購存，並沒有禁止其採運；可知任何人辦米來滬，不能指爲違法。至於國米居奇，有礙民食；自然是法所不恕的。不過囤字的意義，法律上也殊嫌含混。如照上項條文所稱「大量」二字，究竟到了何種數目，方稱大量，方算囤積，似尙需明文規定。此在執行時固易滋爭議，業中人尤不免惴惴不安，多所顧慮。爲疎導來源起見，除一方面取締囤積，嚴防居奇外，同時對於正當米商，亦望有所保障；以期充實存底。所以對於囤米的界限，切盼政府能更進一步作一個適當而明確的規定，庶幾正當商人知所適從，此與民食前途，所關實非淺鮮。</p>

<h3>敎部發言人昨晚發表　交大風潮處理經地過　朱敎長暨陳督學昨已返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕朱敎長家驊，曁陳督學東原，在滬處理交大風潮；事畢，於十四日下午二時半，飛返首都。朱敎長返京後，與政院張院長曁有關人士討論。敎部發言人於十時就交大風潮處理經過，發表談話如下；此次交大學生，爲學校行政諸問題，向本部有所請求，因未全明瞭事實，或因以訛傳訛，致有曲解與誤會之處，竟爾罷課請願，集赴車站，肌碍交通，經本部朱部長去滬，剴切開導，已吿平息。査此次交大學生所提出之要求；</p>
<p>更改校名問題</p>
<p>（一）反對更改校名與改併管理學院，査本部從未有此擬議，前經吳校長保豐，公開說明，朱部長並於致該校管理學院鍾院長函中，指明該校各院系，應均衡發展，不宜有所軒輊。</p>
<p>經費困難問題</p>
<p>（二）所稱交大之經費額，應與其他各校平等待遇一節，査本部一向重視交大之悠久歷史與過去成績，復員以來，尤對該校校務之發展經費設備之充實，悉力籌措，絕無畸輕畸重。該校所感困難，亦係各校所通有，本部時刻籌劃，尋求克服。</p>
<p>航輪兩科問題</p>
<p>（三）要求續辦航海輪機兩科，査此兩科純屬技術使用性質，非普通大學之科系可比，交大在光緒末年設有航海科，迨吳淞商船學校成立，該科即併入商船學校，已有三十餘年，抗戰發生，交大內遷重慶，吳淞商船學校亦於此時移渝，旋以該校因故暫行停辦，乃將航海輪機兩科，暫時委託交大辦理。勝利後本部應各方要求，商船學校遷回上海，乃令兩科仍歸該校辦理，以免分散人材物力，並顧全學制。現該兩科問題，迭據吳校長呈部，請准續辦，交大校友亦有個別同樣意見陳述，經再三硏討，並由田次長到校，會商兩科敎育實質各端，由部批准將輪機科併入造船系，改稱造船輪機系，仍屬工學院，航海科改爲航業管理系，屬管理學院，上述各項問題，皆屬學校行政範圍，一經說明，自易解決。朱部長此次在滬，勉勵該校學生，須認淸時代，勿以越軌行動，而貽誤良知良能，不因有所建議而荒廢學業，眞像旣明，上述各問題遂須得圓滿解決。（參看第四版）</p>

<p>五七比三八客軍愈戰愈勇</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕征輪籃球隊昨晚七時首戰晨友，以五十七比三十八勝第一仗，觀衆尙稱熱鬧。上半時開始時客軍因籃不然，球常在籃圈上轉而不入，故晨友頗露頭角，迨十分鐘時征輪即戰成均勢，十五分鐘後駕而上之，上半時祗賴蔡屠于三人得分，下半時征輪愈戰愈勇，分數扶遙直上。</p>
<p>長力充沛</p>

<p>下半時開始，混戰達三分鐘，征輪蔡屠得手二十九比二十三，晨友又暫停，王炳福易張錦璇，征輪一帆風順，十二分鐘內成三十六比二十三遙領十三分之多，此間晨友曾連獲二球，似見起色，雙方尙平均，四十八比三十四時，征輪愈戰愈勇，對方則有時取「觀望態度」，雖經調整陣綫，卒難抵抗，最後四分鐘爲四十九比三十四，大勢已定，結果五十七比三十八征輪首戰勝利。</p>

<h3>遼東漁鹽</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽四日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>東北是天府之國，中國的無窮資源大半在東北，除廣大的礦藏之外，沿六百英里的海岸綫，有大量的漁業和鹽產，足以補助民食與化學工業的需要，其經濟價値十分寳貴。</p>
<p>漁業衰小統計</p>
<p>記者甫自遼東歸來，據我的調查，爲戰爭所蹂躪的漁鹽區域，已經　　，在最近的將來，復興無望。尤其是漁業在迅速的沒落之中。在敵偽時期，因爲供應日本人的需要，曾有大量的發展，在民國卅年前後，全東北的魚產量每年約十萬噸，海魚及淡水魚各佔一半，海魚以蓋平出產最多，淡水魚以大賣產量最多。據最近的統計，遼東半島共有漁民一萬四千七百地六十七人，漁船無動力帆船二千九百九十二隻，動力機械船三隻，捕魚的方法也非常原始，使用快鉤，張網，風網等，生產量不多。根據卅五年營口一地的統計：一千五百五十個漁民，一年能打三百四十三萬斤魚。（除了大連之外，沒有一個有現代設備的漁業港。）</p>
<p>打魚人　世世窮</p>
<p>一捕魚人兒世世窮，」在偽滿的時候，漁民也受着「出荷」制度的刧奪，在光復之後，因爲烽火不息，在自由的海面與市塲，漁民的利益遭受到更大的破壞，現在一般漁民的生活是在水準綫下，他們除了繳納漁稅與船稅之外，捕得的魚，送到市塲上的「魚床」，被魚販剝削了一倍的利息，而同時他們也得以一部份辛苦的果實，奉獻給神出鬼沒的「葦林」豪傑。在目前，漁民的安全是毫無保障的。捕魚的季節是從三月到十一月的期間，但在隆冬的農曆年關，漁民總得想法捕得一種新鮮偏口的魚送給船主。</p>
<p>日漁船駛進來</p>
<p>在晨光曦微的海面，海風吹送着流傳於漁民口唇上的新漁光曲，那是：告訴麥帥，我們反對日本漁船駛進中口海，我們不再是奴隸！我們要求日本賠償大批的漁船，以補償漁人們被壓權的貧血症。在太陽　廠於東方的深霧之幕，我們的雪亮的眼睛注視着日本的漁船。</p>
<p>東北已面臨鹽荒的邊緣，這是因爲生產無法恢復，存鹽已經用盡的緣故。東北鹽產量達三千萬担，本地需要不過陸百萬担，三分之二的鹽產於遠東半島。最大的鹽廠有營蓋，復縣，錦州三處，此外莊河，錦西，綏豐，盤山，興城等處規模小，而綏鹽的建築是最新式的。可惜廠的設備都被共軍破壞了。接收的存鹽營蓋廠九十七萬担。復縣廠二百六十萬担，錦西，莊河，綏豐，盤山，興城等處約一百萬担，經過一年，存鹽已用完了，而各廠都無法恢復產量，因此，食鹽成了嚴重問題。</p>
<p>電力缺產量徴</p>
<p>以營產　為例，敲僞時期年產魚　十五萬噸今年產量難以遇到七萬噸。這個鹽廠的位置目遼河口至蓋平長達七十　里，官商鹽田面積一千六百十二付（每付合一點五公頃，）破壞程度達百分之八十，完全恢復需費流通劵八億五千萬元，短期內無力恢復。電力設備已被澈底破壞。目前祗好利用被截在鹽田內的潮水製鹽，產量自然微小。</p>
<p>糧價高待遇</p>
<p>鹽工的生活更較貧苦，他們的待遇養活自己都困難，更何足以養子妻，領工月薪九千五百元，捻頭九千元，打頭八千五百元，鹽工八千元。營蓋各地的高粱米價是一百廿元一斤，以這樣可憐的待遇，一個月只能買六十七斤高粱米。據營蓋鹽廠廠長楊士林先生告記者：「改善鹽工待遇問題，我們雖然竭力想辦法，困難非常多，我們正想法以實物供給工人，如能實現，每一個工人一個月可領到二百五十斤高粱米。」在糧價飛漲聲中，鹽區最迫切的需要是米。</p>

<h3>福州社會相</h3>
<p>— 三日福州航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>近半月來，豪雨纏綿，把一向靜的福州都市更顯得市景素淡，行人依稀，司馬訐寫「重慶客」描寫雨裏的重慶街頭滿地都是「香菰」，雨裏的福州，十個人中難見一二人穿雨衣，多半都是拿着負有盛名的福州土製雨傘，滿街頭也何嘗不都是「特產」呢？</p>
<p>往者久旱不雨，米價飛騰，可是，下了半月豪雨，米價依然上升，米　說溪洪暴漲，閩北米船不能下行，來源缺乏，也成爲米貴的藉詞，升斗小民，不禁喟然長嘆！</p>
<p>米價高漲　吃平價飯</p>
<p>福州市黨部近與行總福建辦事處合辦了一個平價食堂，在沒有「客飯」制的地方確是一個福音，每餐供應一千份，每份一千元，一菜一湯十兩白飯，在此物價高漲聲中倒是便宜。食堂內每日客至如雲，大半爲小公務員，學生及苦力者，循序列隊購票入席，後到者往往抱向隅之憾。在這個隙縫裏，可以看到福州一般人生活的艱難。</p>
<p>福州人有逛「南街」的雅興，入夜街頭熙熙攘攘，可惜最近停了電，諳然無光，近日來風淸月明，市民借着月光在街頭蹓跶，倒別有一番風趣。福州市警局為杜防　小活動，已請各保甲於夜間懸掛油燈，以維夜間治安。</p>
<p>赫然炸彈　驚動官員</p>
<p>日前省府內工役於修繕走廊挖土時，發現地下埋有炸彈一枚，刹時秩序大亂，驚動府內官員，員工相率遠避。按該彈方園約十五公分，彈身發銹甚厚，似已埋存多時，何來此彈，有謂敵人臨走時埋存，有謂戰時敵機所擲未爆發之炸彈。傳說紛紜，後由保安司令部派工兵發掘，竟乃一大塊之炸彈片，被埋於地下，　成一塲虛驚，亦爲一小趣劇。</p>
<p>夏令將屆　垃圾堪慮</p>
<p>福州市內沒有自來水設備，因而產生了許多問題。年來時空的流行，主要是基於市民飲用不潔的幷水有以致之，且火警發生，也往往受到水源的限制而肇巨災，甚至夏令一至，市民用水量增加，有些地帶井水涸竭，一個居在海邊的都市竟然弄到水的恐慌，煞是奇事。福州市上最近有人注意到垃圾問題，蓋垃圾到處堆積，臭氣薰天，殊予市民健康以不良的影響，福州各報質問市政當局三百餘淸道夫到那裏去，長此以往，這個花園式的都市豈不變成垃圾城了，不過，古蹟明倫堂確已成爲垃圾堆，附近學校及居民提出抗議，據云附近中心小學學生患了腦膜炎，與垃圾有關</p>
<p>華淸溫泉　春寒賜浴</p>
<p>福州——溫泉之鄉，從城的東北湯邊鄉起，向城的東南迤遷，一直到王莊附近，縱橫一萬多尺，區域之遼闊冠於東南各省，福州的東北門呌湯門，就是因溫泉而得名的，湯門一帶掘地鑿井，泉水泊泊流出來，浴堂林立，「華淸溫泉，春寒賜浴」千古傳爲佳話。一般初到福州的外鄉人士，莫不同聲稱羡福州就浴之便利與舒爽，福州的浴堂與四川的茶館有同樣的功用，訴訟的排解，聊天消愁，浴堂是一大去處，溫泉含有硫磺質，平均溫度六十多度，有殺菌的能力，可　皮膚病。</p>

<p>請取締車站黃牛黨</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個三輪車夫，起先我們　三輪車的一家兩口，生活尚可維特，不料近來不但米珠薪桂，火車站內黃牛黨又大施活躍，（黃牛黨是三輪車和黃包車薦頭的別名）本市北站黃牛黨共有四五十人，火車一到上海，乘客下車，他們便問乘客兜攬願坐者當時就　好車資，他從中取利，例如容人出車資一萬元，黃牛黨將客人介紹至我們，我們只得四五千元，其餘是黃牛黨入袋，不是久走江湖的客人，往往被他們詐欺，不是多出車資，便是行李失蹤，踏三輪車是不得進車站的，因爲第一路警不允許，第二假便偸空進去接客，車子放在外面，常常被人弄破或是車胆被人戳懷，（這呌做打藥水針）分明都是黃牛黨出的伎倆，希望鐵路當局和市警機關對是項黃牛黨予以嚴厲取締，以免我們勞苦車夫多一層剝削。（勞苦的車夫）</p>

<h3>「人間詞話」讀後</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>海寗王靜安先生，詞格高雅，詩句淸奇，博學鴻辭，名播宇內，詞章之學足與散原老人平分天下，章句之功，堪與太炎先生傳世，惜以國難家愁，自投於昆明池，一代才人，竟做楚臣，其見困於羅振玉，亦足知先生高風亮節，難與世俗推移。所作「人間詞話」一書，爲詞林推重，　以其：「必須身居局中，局中人知甘苦；又須身居局外，局外人有公論。」（兪平伯語），故能以入應山而睹眞面見重乎詞苑。其開宗明義旣曰：</p>
<p>『詞以境界爲上，有境界則自成高格，自有名句，五代北宋之詞所以獨絕者在此。』</p>
<p>世人每以白石美成見重，殊不知白石「燕燕輕盈，鶯鶯嬌軟」一種女兒態，其香　比之飛卿「書屛金鷓鴣』，正中：「嬌雯堆枕钗横鳳，溶溶春水楊花夢。」，端已：「爐邊人似月，皓腕凝霜雪。」………即顯得小家氣。即以其「暗香」，「疏影」二闋，亦有小品靜物之狀，未若後主大幅油像威嚴端莊也。</p>
<p>『無我之境，人惟於靜中得之；有我之境，於動之靜時得之。故一優美，一宏壯也。』</p>
<p>靜安此語，非深知個中甘苦者不能說出。惟能忘我，我始能不求與自然冥合，而陶然與天地密契；然無我之境，亦有高下之分，「采菊東籬下，悠然見南山」，「曲終人不見，江上數峯靑」，上品也；「寒波澹澹起，白鳥悠悠下」，「細雨魚兒出，微風燕子斜」中品也。何則？前者十字之中無故意凑作現象，正所謂天衣無縫；其品之高，在於實欲禾道而道之也。寒波白鳥雖以起出見稱，魚兒燕子雖以出斜見勝，然均有意爲之，司空表聖所謂：『不著一字，便得風流』者，原在乎用字不泥於工拙而工拙自顯，「數峯靑苦，零落黄昏語………」雖出之於「江上數峯靑」，兩兩相較，自分涇渭，至若謝眺：「澄江靜如練」爲李白續成：「愛道澄江靜如練，令人常憶謝玄暉。」便覺畫蛇添足。是以格調之高者，不能增添損益，若永叔將朱慶餘；「妝罷低聲問夫婿，畫眉深淺入時無？」增爲：</p>
<p>「鳳髻金泥帶，龍紋玉掌梳；去來扇下笑相扶，愛道：「畫眉深淺入時無？」。弄筆愄人久，描花試手初；等閑防了綉功夫，笑問：「鴛鴦兩字怎生書？」。」</p>
<p>前者細膩多情，一變而爲帶點「妖氣」矣。</p>
<p>「淚眼間花花不語，亂紅飛過秋千去。」，「執手相看淚眼，竟無語凝咽………」，兩皆有我之境，然淚眼問花花飛去，其寂寞，悵惘之情，實非柳七之詞可擬；以通行論，則柳七暢然可曉，平易近人，故：「有井水處皆歌柳詞」，以詞品論，則永觀詞天眞未　，了然會心。故有我之中有上品；無我之中亦有上品也。至若：「綠楊影裏出秋千」，「紅杏枝頭春意鬧」………用字工穩可愛，然與天眞相較，便遜一籌。</p>
<h3>談「科學大衆」</h3>
<p>— 余建光</p>
<p>一種中國本位的通俗科學讀物</p>
<p>世界科學正在跨着大步邁進，中國科學怎麽樣呢？一般地說，這情况是够懷慘的。單一講學術方面，原有的學術機構已都是抱殘守缺，學術空氣的振興是不用談了。從五四到今天，科學仍然是少數「讀書人」所專有的，科學的傳播技術上主要的是仰賴文字。一般大衆字都不能識，報都看不懂，還談得到認識科學，學習科學麽？更且科學的傅播始終局限在少數都市裏，學生爲對象。於是結果呢，像上海這樣的地方，害了病求神拜籤的還有，更不談其他更貧乏更偏僻的地區了。然而你能說中國的民衆不需要科學麽，却又不然。中國人民非僅需要科學來充實他們的生活方式，非僅需要科學來改進他們的生產技術，即是在思想和行爲上，科學的方法和訓練對於他們也有帮助。照我個人的看法，中國目前容許需要設立原子能研究所和數學硏究中心來顯耀國家的榮譽，但是把科學知識普及到全國各地的民衆，把科學大衆化，對於我們還是更迫切，更實惠。</p>
<p>科學文字　亟宜講求</p>
<p>基於這個認識我願意提出最近出版的「科學大衆」月刋做一個討論。逼本刋物到現在才出了七期，但是無論在讀書界在科學界，在工商界都已引起相當的注意，在望平街上據說也是易銷書刋的一種。通俗科學刋物能够暢銷，不可不慶幸這大衆對於科學的增加愛好的是一個好現象，但却也不能忽略了科學大衆這本刊物在方式上之更切近大衆化爲一個重要因素。讀科學大衆，很少人會不體會到它裏面文章的流利，有很多的小標題，容易成誦。許多人往往感覺到科學的艱深，其實與其說科學是艱深的，母寗說是一</p>
<p>般科學文字難懂。中國人研究科學，要看書，最先只有外團書可看，慢慢中文科學書有了，又由於寫作者的科學家大都不考究文字，結果懂英文的仍舊以看英文書爲習慣，不懂英文的仍是無從涉獵科學的堂奧。中國人要末不要科學，要科學，必須要有自己文字的科學書，而且這文字絕不能生硬呆滯。科學大衆裏面的文字，是不是即可作爲今後科學文字的榜樣，當然還需要好好檢討一下。一般的說，它的文字的淺顯和流暢，是並普通的綜合性刊物都不輸讓的。</p>
<p>其次，我覺得科學大衆之大量採用插圖是値得稱許的。今日的文字原是從象影演獎而來，有許多地方文字說不淸楚的，一張圖即可以解釋分明。客觀地研究一般人的興趣，圖畫是較之文字爲更吸引的。譬如四月號的科學大衆，有一篇關於浙贛鐵路的通訊，下面附了一張全綫的計畫圖，我想江浙一帶的人儘管數得淸，京滬滬杭兩路每個站次的名稱，這第三條大路怎麼走的恐怕很少人會淸楚，這張圖對於介紹浙贛路的功効是很大的。該刊很注重圖片的收集，行政院善後救濟總署和幾個大使館的新聞處經常的供給他們材料和照片，是一種很有意義的合作。</p>
<p>紹介國內　建設情況</p>
<p>翻閱「科學大衆」，感覺他們似乎在並行地向着兩個方向努力即是「介紹國內建設情况，闡述世界科學進展。」在世界科學方面，可以拿該刋的二月號（實際上是一月底就發賣了的）「一九四六年的世界科學」特輯爲代表，以小小的篇幅，把過去一年世界科學的成績，工業的製品，和諾貝爾獎金在物理，化學，和醫藥衛生的得獎人都介紹了，無諭在時間的爭取，在表達的方式上，都很適當。國內建設情况的介紹，科學大衆從創刋號起一直保持到現在，四月號是撫順的介紹。有一位担任國際文化交流的朋友同我談起，他說國外常有科學刋物送來，而中國的定期科學刋物就難得有幾種能拿得出去，爲什麽呢？全本從外國翻得來，寄到外國去，難道呌他們譯轉來？科學大衆也不免這個弊病，它也有很多文章從外國雜誌取材，但是每期的第一二篇，如果拿出去，倒也是一點東西，自己的材料，自己的照片，不妨向國外的朋友介紹，像這一類的文章應該只嫌其少，不嫌其多。</p>
<p>長篇連載　不很合適</p>
<p>科學大衆對於醫藥生理的文章分屬相當多，最近並且添了一欄「大衆醫藥衛生顧問」，這也許是他們着眼於民族的健康和保育的綠故。幾個基本科學的講話，做中等學校的理科敎材很是相宜，不過一個月出現一篇，時間上　怕太長久了。「科學奇境漫游　，」取材不很新頴不是一篇很適合的長篇連載。此外，純粹科學的文字較應用科學的文字爲少，農業方面的文章還沒有，在這些學科努力的中國科學家，似乎可以給他們一點帮助。</p>
<p>「科學大衆」是一本刊物，它仍不免以文字爲技術。科學大衆化的要求是以愈接近大衆爲愈理想，通過它的文字，插圖和售價，它在比較中可以算得走近大衆化的路。但是在今日的中國，恐怕只有靑年人才有讀書的能力和習慣，能有幾本到達眞正大衆的手裏，有幾分之幾可爲他們所吸收和採用呢？在担任科學大衆化的工作上，科學大衆是不是能以現在的工作爲滿足？這就値得該刊和全國的科學家們深思和熟慮了。</p>

<p>地理讀物很貧乏的今天——雖然還有幾本地理上的書籍，而一般上講它是貧乏的。現在，建國中學生讀物叢刋中的幾册地理著作，內容通俗精確，的確是解救貧乏的饑饉之作。其中尤以陳原的這册，「世界地理基礎」，內容爲最優良。</p>
<p>這本書的形式是很活潑的，內容却非常充實，它沒有如普通地理著作的有死板的固定原則，使讀者感到悶而頭痛。而它是十分自然地講出了世界的地理荔礎：包括土地，人民，氣候，交通，和資源，各部門講得雖簡短，而很明確。誠然的，這太書較之著作者的另一書「規代世界地理之話」，是有過之而無不及的。</p>
<p>作者的處理這本著作，是非常生動有趣的，他一開頭就提到水的世界，而首先就很有趣的說：假如海洋一旦乾涸了，你猜會有什麽事情發生？接着便逐一解說了遛問題，並且還述出了海洋的重要性，以及海洋的分布，五大洋，江河，著名的河流，運河，湖等，都是根據最新的材料，明白地說出。</p>
<p>地理著作原來是很沉悶的，而作者採取了新的活潑的方式來著作，使讀者非但不感到沉悶，而祗覺得淸新活潑可讀，這種方式，可以說是一種很大的成功。</p>
<p>作者再用同樣方式，繼續說明了地形，大陸，氣候，人類，交通，農作物的地理，動力資源的地理，金屬和非金屬資源。在上述各部門中，作者均分了很多的節段來充分地叙述了出來。</p>
<h3>赴美留學指導」評介</h3>
<p>— 李雪中</p>
<p>劉志宏編著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>吾國自淸季即有留學生赴美求學，時間不能算晚，學成歸國的人已不知有幾萬。但對於美國大學情形向少介紹於國人，過去見之於專著者可謂絕無。我國駐外使領館皆忙於國際交涉，僑民問題，商務事項，故亦未暇去考察各國大學內幕。所以國內各大學學生雖渴望知道美國大學的情形，亦無從獲得，想欲赴美留學的人更感到苦悶。因爲對於美國學校情形大多一無所知，往往發生誤投學校之事。</p>
<p>前東北大學敎授劉君志宏以親身之經歷及在美考察所得，編著「赴美留學指導」一書，約計十萬言。書中自籌備出國手續述起以至學成歸國爲止，其間凡留美學生所欲知道的事項多已備論無遺。</p>
<p>此書之主要部份爲美國高等學府的總述，大學院系的分析，硏究院總論三章。在此三章中將美國大學的組織，各校院系之優劣與分析，博士碩士學位之應試方法等等均作極詳細之述論。此外，關於在美期間衣食住行，美國大學學生生活，英美禮俗各方面，亦各有專章詳爲叙述。故凡擬赴美留學者，對於本書實有一讀之必要。</p>
<h3>浪淘沙</h3>
<p>— 楓葉</p>
<p>舒湮著作　萬葉書讓出版</p>
<p>多難的中國，現在正遭遇着五十年前的相似底命運。那是正値甲午戰敗，促成戊戌政變，新的勢力與舊的潮流在展開着正面接觸底時代；不久庚子拳亂，整個國家陷入了岌岌可危的狀態。時至今日，抗戰雖獲勝利，然而國內混亂的局面，却使億萬世國運所繫的建國大計不能順利進行。因此，「存亡絕續」的關頭，又放在中國人的面前！</p>
<p>覺察出這種危機的人當然不會緘默的。在舒湮先生的浪淘沙裏，他吿訴我們一個五十年前的故事，同時也在使我們感覺地注視今日中國陰無底背影。</p>
<p>浪淘沙是最近出版的一個劇本。故事是發生在前淸左都御史夏永淸的家裏。頑固，倔强，倨傲，守舊的「重臣」，滿腦的「綱常」，「名敎」却不能牢龍着被時代的浪潮所激醒的新生代。他的長子夏鐸聲與「六君子」之一的譚嗣同過從甚密；次子鐸民接受了國父興中會的洗禮。</p>
<p>中日之戰失敗了。年肯的人被刺戟着。正當「重膺疆寄」的大人先生在歌舞昇于，却又同時歎息着「人心不古」的當兒，「維新」在康有爲梁啓超的領導之下實行了。「變法」的詔諭驚破了「紅頂花翎」的夢。這其間，夏鐸聲也在串演着一個要角。他的弟弟雖然沒有行動，但在積極地工作。</p>
<p>可是，歷史證明了康梁的路綫並不正確。靠着「延擱推宕」的四字妙訣，和陰諜毒辣的手段，「大臣」們在人人自危的「同病相憐」下團結起來，終於造成了「戊戌政變」。夏鐸聲和父親鬧翻了；又在「六君子」死難後出走了。頑固守舊派獲得全盤勝利，而政治也變得更糟。甚至在「朝廷」扶植下，產生了「義和團」，招致了「八國聯軍」之禍。</p>
<p>沒有爲「維新」所淹沒，卒至被「外患」所冲倒。夏永淸，被兒子「連累」去官的這位遺老，在鑾興西遷，都城陷落之後，也只能逃難至上海租界，度「頤養天年」底生活。鐸民在上海又繼續着他的工作。鐸聲也改變以往錯誤的方針，參加興中會爲英命努力。這時候，夏永淸中風逝　，全劇至此結束。</p>
<p>以這樣嚴肅的故事爲主題，穿捅入許多「世家」的家庭生活和關係，本劇的整體還是非常緊凑，無懈可擊的。字句的淸新流利，當然更不待言。</p>
<p>尤其在寫作的技巧上，「象徴法」是自始至終常被應用，而收得「發人深省」的效果的。整個的描寫底刻劃傳神，有力的結束底雷霆萬鈞…………在在使人覺得這是一本値得推薦的好書。</p>
<p>據著者在前記中所述，這浪淘沙尙有續貂。「醉太平」是寫革命成功至一九二七年的大革命中間的時代；中興頌是從九一八事變至抗戰勝利的一串日子底側影。然而我們以爲僅就本劇而言，已足爲中國的今天底一面鏡子。</p>
<p>以作者自己所說的話來闡明本劇的意義，是「從一個世宦大家的故事中寫出這半世紀來中華民族的受難，抗爭和復興」。事實上，我相信作者是希望指出一部分民族的危機的。</p>
<p>今日的中國，旣已臨到五十年前的厄運底邊綠，每個人都不能不深切地考嗽反省一下，究竟自己有沒有走錯了路？有沒有爲了自己的利益而巧立「民主」之名，遂行危害國家民族之實？本書提供了這樣一個問題：——「路是要人走出來的，祗有那）條　才走得通。」那麽？你是否誤入了歧途？</p>
<h3>「中華國民生活曆」書後</h3>
<p>— 盤根</p>
<p>（陳果　邱培豪合·正中書局出版）</p>
<p>漢書　文志稱：我國漢代以前，已有黄帝，　頊，夏，股，局，習六層，曆法之　，由來遠要。</p>
<p>中國以農立團，歲時之紀，本以爲秋收冬藏之序。所謂「不失農時，」政敎之本也。然自專制之政體立，乃以元定正朔，於是記載典章之籍興，禮記及歷代史書之禮樂志屬之；自戰緯之說盛，乃以之爲占筮休咎之用，於是千支五行之說行，託名東方朔之占審及後代星命之書屬之。至於民間習尙，足以覩一代政事得失之專著，反不多觀。有之，則濫觴於風俗通，而荆楚歲時記始作以歲月爲序之記述。但或限於一時，或僅記一地，類皆文人筆餘所錄，閒情之作。其他則一鳞半爪，散見羣書，其著者如事物原始，風土記，武林舊事，以及各地方志諸　。又如角觝之戲，至漢大盛，其制略見於史記李斯傳，漢書武帝本紀，文選兩京賦注，掦術洛陽伽藍記等等，若非博徴廣引，莫得其詳。董而理之，殊非朝夕可致也。</p>
<p>今閱陳邱二先生合著之中華國民生活層，雖一吟一咏之微，苟有關風尙，扉不畢錄。提要鈎元，蔚成大國；而援古例今，有裨政敎，東方古國之文化，於茲灼然可見，誠宜推行海外，人手一編。據作者序云，此書編撰，凡歷十載，補苣者屢，其用心之深，用力之勤，概可見已。</p>
<h3>用馬糞製烟</h3>
<p>— 幾幹</p>
<p>日本眞是一個善於製造代用品的國家。最近由於配給紙烟數量之少，竟有人異想天開，發明一種新出品，其烟葉係用馬糞經過特別方法剪切拼製而成。據說此種紙烟經分析以後，其烟味尙不若預料之觸鼻刺喉。因而購者爭先恐後，銷路極廣，使一般紙烟商人感到威脅。</p>
<p>用臭的馬糞來製造紙烟，在我們素來將它稱為香烟的國人看來，實在是一個諷刺，可是由於供應的缺乏，竟然能够將馬糞銜在口裏，吃在肚裏，也可見一個有了烟　的人，會飢不擇食到什麽程度。</p>
<p>日本人善於製造代用品，同時日本貨與其他國家的貨品此較起來，其本身也就是一種代用品。我們過去把日本貨稱爲劣貨，不是沒有理由。然而這種代用品的劣貨，却曾經是國貨以及西洋貨的威脅。老百姓並非不愛國，抗戰入年是一個鐵證，可是提到抵制劣貨就有一點慚愧。此中理由，正和日本人愛吸馬糞製成的紙烟一樣。</p>
<p>貨物之中有代用品。其他一切人事也有代用品。當一個學生不能靠自己平日的勤學來應付考試的時候，他就用開夜車來代替；倘無開夜車還不足以應付，誠實的人交了自卷，不誠實的人就用作弊來代替。到了作弊成了萬不得已無可如何的代用品的時候，在他個人也實在是到了山窮水盡的時候。再就這個作弊的學生來說。他本人在一級之中有時無形之中也成了代用品。當一級之中可以通過考試而升級或畢業的人數太少的時候，作弊的同學便起而補足其缺額，混了過去</p>
<p>可見代用品之出現，總在於用品的缺少。代用品出現以後，用品就感到威脅。倘然我們把代用品的範圍千萬倍放大來看，就可以看出今日代用品的出產之多。以及用品所感到的威脅之大。我們澈頭澈尾憎惡代用品的出現，可是問題的解決還有待於用品本身的努力。</p>

<h3>退票問題</h3>
<p>— 吳德潤</p>
<p>在商業繁盛的上海，每日所有的交易，假使全憑現鈔交易，那至少又須「請求」增發幾種百萬元劵，千萬元券，才能「使用便利」因此，目前較大款額之交易，貨款大多以支票給付，熟悉的客人，有信用的商店，當然一紙支票，和現鈔是並無分別的，相反的，手續更便利多多。然而，如遇初次交易，或不十分信任對方，那麽接受支票者，便感到爲難了。爲難的原因，當然祗是擔心支票的遭退票。</p>
<p>退票的主要原因，當然是賬戶內存款有限，支票款額已越過存款額。但一般行莊為顧全客戶信譽起見，當隱「存款不足」，而僞稱「託收款項尙未收到」，來欺騙「執票人」。有些行莊更以「請與出票人接洽」或「請再來收」作爲退票理由，那眞使「執票人」惑到迷惘，莫名其妙了。因此，我主張銀行，錢莊，對退票的理由，不該含糊其詞，而應爲執票人詳細解釋明白。存款「足不」，則直言「不足」，不能使執票人感到進退兩難。（款收不到，而退還出票人，則退票理由，又言「請再來收」，似難以爲情。）</p>
<p>尤其是現在的市情，旦夕有變，加上欠款拆息龐大，假使售出貨物，收進一張空頭支票，損失重，如果，支票轉付或存介仃莊後遭退，那更與本人信譽顏面有關。因此，我們認爲簽發　頭支票者，所負法律責任，不容寬恕。雖然，目前法院對簽發空頭支票之訴訟，有償還之判令，但這判令，似尙嫌輕。對於執票人方面，所受精神的損傷，亦應判令相當的補償，不久前，「銀錢聯」曾有通吿各仃莊，大意是，凡客戶開發空頭支票，超越三次者，即以結淸帳戶，收回支票簿之處分，這是個很好的辦法，希望各行莊能切實執行，以使濫發支票者，有所顧忌，而稍戢其風；間接亦能减少社會上不少的糾紛，以維持支累的信實。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納　與費雯麗</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>弗蘭克·哈理期在蕭伯納傳裏寫道，「他（蕭伯納）說，當他有閑暇的時候，有一夭，他會重寫哈孟雷特，他要運樣地寫，以便把哈孟雷特的眞正意義提示出來。」</p>
<p>從這風句話裏，我們可以看出蕭的幽默。幽默幷不是插科打譚，這裏面可以體味出他的嚴肅意味。對於多方面的事物，從哲學到政治，蕭都是急進的，他的幽默，便常常撕開那些矛盾的外衣，使眞理赤裸裸地　露。</p>
<p>蕭和其他的思想家不同，他的信徒普及於各階層，但他却和莎士比亞一樣，他的作品是被多方面的讀者所閱讀。驚並不單是一個思想家，因爲假使單是一個思想家，他還不能够深深打動續者的感情，這部「璇宮艷后」寫克里奧派屈拉與愷撒之間的一段事蹟，是他最好的歷史喜劇之一。</p>
<p>蕭以一八五六年七月廿六日生於愛爾蘭，今尙健在，他的素食主義，使他非常健康，攝製此片時，他常到攝影塲去和費雯鷹撩天，敎她怎樣去演這個角色，可見蕭是怎樣重視這個劇本了。</p>
<h3>藏胞的情歌</h3>
<p>— 李朴園</p>
<p>塔兒寺每年一度的晒經大典快到，藏胞·回胞·同蒙胞的男男女女，都從四處的草原，山地，帳棚，土屋裏，百川匯海似的，在魯沙爾（文華鎭）的塔兒寺集中起來；在他們中間，有土司·有貴族·也有平常的老百姓；尤其是婦女們，各依她們本族的習慣，穿上她們最華貴·最美麗的衣服，帶着她們最好的飾物，以及她僅有的銀圓，準備在這兒消耗她們十幾個愉快的日子。</p>
<p>差不多在晒經正日的前十天，正對文華鎭的那座一半給寺廟佔了的小山，一派碧綠的靑草，點綴着疏疏落落許多楊柳之間，雪白的帳棚，小雪堆兒似的撑起來，有些比較接近，有些比較疏遠；它們的前前後後，大紅·大綠；大紫衣服的婦女們，辮子·纓絡·飄帶·隨着溫暖的微風。蝴蝶的粉翅兒似的，飛過來，飄過去的亂轉；太陽是亮的，她們身前身後的銀的，王的，珊瑚的飾物，繁星似的在陽光下面閃爍。</p>
<p>在這附近的任何一個地方，任何一個人，如要你有一瓶酒，不到幾分鐘，就會有一些男女同胞集中起來，立刻，凄婉的，高亢的，尖銳的歌聲，便搖搖曳曳地起來了；人，圍成直徑一兩丈的一個圈子，越圍越厚，中間是情歌的歌手，周圍就是觀衆。這唱情歌的人，男女成對，有的年歲大些，大約都是慣唱情歌的人；有的年紀小些，據說都是初試情塲的人。</p>
<p>情歌的調子，大致都是千　一律的，歌者只可在情緒的變化上，把某些聲音拉得畏些，或挑得高些；特別可以看出他們或她們底詩才之高下的，便是，情歌的歌辭都是即興的，隨歌者耳目同思念之所及，立刻引用到歌裏去，絲毫不加思索，加以，對手是先唱的，他或她所唱的歌辭，你如果接下去唱，便只好檢恰好可以續得上的——這不是很不容易嗎？然而，我們這些看似粗便粗氣的藏胞們，却十有九九應付得非常流利，自然！</p>
<p>歌同時伴着舞，絕沒有木影泥趨似的唱情歌的。規矩是：第一個唱的人，指印拿着酒瓶　歌載舞，便有權利在一　完了的時候，把瓶子交給自己看上眼的人，那人一接瓶子，立刻就得接着唱；如果在場的人，看上了唱着的人，也可在最後一字的歌聲未了的時候，立刻接上去，那末，被接的人也得把瓶子交全你——有多少時，——因多人才同情哥唱和得對勁兒，不管有多少人看着，便立刻相偕着跑出圈子，去參他（她）們的歡　禪的啊！</p>
<h3>顧曲記</h3>
<p>— 聽者</p>
<p>崑曲始於明代魏良輔，盛於淸初，嘉道以後，成廣陵散矣。申報館有志提倡，於月之四日晚，假東方電台廣播，第一齣爲西樓配之拆書·殷震賢先生之趙伯將，柳護圖小姐之于叔夜，殷君崑山世家，傷科名宿，其曲向為兪栗　先生（即鄃振飛之尊翁）讚賞，以喬醋，拾　，呌　等得名，曲家稱為股喬　，訓小姐乃其弟子，所唱一江風「意闌珊……」一段，字正啟團，輕鬆老練，紅衲襖」看他燦　瑩……」散板一段，極不易唱，高出雲霄，低入海底，若無相當工夫，何敢嘗試；說白處處合乎劇情，于叔夜與趙伯將舌戰一段，精彩異常，問答緊凑，天衣無縫，不愧傳股君衣缽也。尤可佩者，四聲字字準確，抑揚頓挫，酷似其師。拆書旣畢。繼之者，朱堯文先生，與沈琢如女士占花魁之獨占，唱白俱甚老到，又一妙曲也。葉小泓先生唱長生殿之絮閣，喜遷鶯「休得把……」散曲一段，似嫌過少，聽者未能飽領耳福，葉君亦老曲家，兩鬢已霜，尙能唱且，眞是難能可貴。周萼軒先生唱畏生殿之驚變，石榴花「不勞你……」嗓音寬宏，極合帝王身份，有獨到妙處，逈殊凡響矣。聞周君亦係殷門高足，可佩之至，以後雅奏，如能添置樂器，使笙管琵琶等，與王笛配合複音，當更出色，國樂如此，奚必求諸異城耶！？</p>
<h3>美麗的火災</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲女：聽說你的哥哥被消防隊開差了。</p>
<p>乙女：是啊——這是爲了他眼睛近視的緣故。</p>
<p>甲女：怎麼樣的呢？</p>
<p>乙女：他用水龍頭澆了一個下半天，結果發現原來不是火，却是一個紅頭髮的外國女人。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>「人爲什麽怕死？」</p>
<p>看起來這是一個簡單並且可笑的問題，然而，細細想一想·這和蘋菜爲什麽掉在地上的間題一樣，並不是値不得讓我們這些自詡爲萬物之靈的人們思慮一番的·</p>
<p>如果不是記錯，或附會的話，那應該是屬於歐洲一位不甚著名的哲人底看法，他說：</p>
<p>「人之所以貪生惡死，全是太陽的綠故。太陽的存在，有一種不可捉摸的能，喚起生物，尤其是人類求生的意志。所以，如果一且太陽毁滅，而人類尙有條件可能倖存的話，人類因求生意志的喪失，勢將生死同觀，且將視死亡爲無所謂之坦途。</p>
<p>是故，就歷史或目前的現世界觀，除一切暴殄，意外不計外，一般性類的病故，大都在晚上；沒有太陽光照耀的時候。</p>
<p>而臨危的病人，自知沉疴難起，常常問近侍的人說：「幾點錄了？」或「天快亮了吧？」從這語氣中推求其潛在意識似乎是說明，病人冀盼天亮，冀盼看見第二天的太陽。如果看見了太陽好像又能度過第二天的日子。</p>
<p>我向讀者朋友提出了這樣一個優問題。如果有興趣的話，我希望能呷一口濃茶，噴一口淡淡的烟；然後，靜靜地想一想。</p>
<p>長之說得好：</p>
<p>藝術必須得和實生活有一點距離。</p>
<p>因為，這點距離的所在，正是審美的領域的所在。像醫生吧，他無論多末慈悲，動手術的時候，却必須有似乎的「殘忍」，他的心可以是軟的，然而手却還是硬的。</p>
<p>台生批評的的性格說：「你是最熱情的一個，可是，你也是最殘酷的一個。」</p>
<p>我坦然地承認了他的話。應該加以補充和說明的只是，當我殘酷地處理一件事的時候，我並不自私地感到痛快，我僅是覺得無涯的痛苦。</p>
<p>在生活上，爲了明天，我也有爲自己動手術的時候。別人從表而觀察我，覺得我鎭靜冷漠得近於寡情。然而，我的心在顫動，這現象永遠不會爲肉眼所察及。</p>
<p>迭更斯之所謂，心與心之神秘，我已經深深地瞭解了。</p>

<h3>Lu Chinese Army Launches Lightning Advance: Yishui Besieged, Fierce Fighting; Anti-Communist Wave Among Shandong Civilians Spreads</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 14th] The Lu Chinese Army has launched a lightning advance towards Boshan, covering the retreating Communist First Column. For days, the pursuing Nationalist troops have annihilated and captured most of them. The right-wing Nationalist forces, advancing rapidly towards Boshan along both sides of the Laiwu-Boshan Highway, completely annihilated over 5,000 Communist troops from one division at Gaoqiao, 36 li northeast of Laiwu, and in the Hengshan Town (吐絲口 northeast 22 li) and the Gutuishan area west of it on the morning of the 14th. Furthermore, on the left flank, a strong Nationalist force attacked Qingishiguan, a strategic pass towering into the clouds 20 li southwest of Boshan, on the 14th. After a day of intense fighting, it was captured at 4 PM. In the afternoon, the right-wing Nationalist forces, from Gaoqiao, made a flanking attack on Boshan from the southeast at Gongdou Town. The Communist forces in Boshan are now encircled by the Nationalist troops and are expected to be annihilated.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 14th] It is reported that the main force of the Lu Communist Army has gathered again around Yishui and Yong's outskirts. In addition to the Second Column originally stationed there, the Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Columns also gathered there starting on the evening of the 13th, making the fighting around Yishui even more intense. There have only been minor skirmishes in Mingshui and Boshan. As of the evening of the 14th, the Lu Communist regular forces were still south of the Yellow River, showing no signs of crossing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 14th] The Nationalist forces, searching the Lushang mountain area east of the Xintai-Laiwu Highway, encircled and annihilated over 2,000 Communist troops in the area east of Yanzhuang and the Mushan area of Maozhuang on the morning of the 14th, killing and capturing over 1,000 Communist troops and seizing a large amount of supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 14th] The Communist forces that attacked Qihe City on the outskirts of Jinan were repelled by the Nationalist forces after reinforcements arrived by 1:00 AM on the 14th. Yancheng was briefly occupied by the Communist forces starting on the morning of the 13th, but they were also driven out by the Nationalist forces by the evening of the 14th, and the Communist forces retreated towards Yucheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Anti-Communist sentiment among the people of Jiaodong has spread from Qixia, Fushan, and Penglai counties to Muping. Recently, the people near Jiji (38 kilometers south of Muping) who could not bear the Communist army's conscription and grain collection, formed an anti-Communist organization, seized over a hundred rifles from the Communist army's county troops, and killed over fifty Communist village cadres. This anti-Communist wave is now rapidly expanding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 14th] The people of Penglai, who hate the Communist army's tyranny, joined forces with 3,000 anti-war elements from the Communist army and occupied Yingkou Mountain (180 li west of Yantai), confronting the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 14th] The Communist Liu Bocheng's Seventh Column, consisting of two battalions and over a thousand militiamen, which had infiltrated to Anjiazhuang, 40 li north of Ningyang in western Shandong, was captured and completely annihilated by the Nationalist forces on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] In western Shandong, the Nationalist forces have been conducting pacification work in the areas between Ningyang, Wenkou, Dongping, Dong'a, Pingyin, Feicheng, and Tai'an counties for days, with remarkable results.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Changji Continue to Cause Disturbances; Mongolian Cavalry in Shuangchengbao Mutiny; Nationalist Forces Are Now Trying to Accommodate Them</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] Although the Northeast Communist forces' offensive has begun, it has not yet materialized. The Nationalist forces are also actively preparing, and mobile troops are being transported north by train. According to military authorities, the Communist forces' intentions will only be announced in the coming days, as it is necessary to observe their trends.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] The Communist forces seem to be planning to attack the rear of Jilin and Changchun from the side, capturing the "wasp waist" area formed by the Communist forces' power, such as Siping and Gongzhuling. The Communist forces east of the railway may attack Hailong, Meihekou, and Xi'an on the Pingmei Road to create a coordinated situation between the east and west.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] (1) The Communist forces invading Nongan were still confronting the Nationalist forces about ten li northwest of the city as of the morning of the 14th. Over a thousand Communist troops from Xihalatun, north of Nongan, joined forces with another Communist force Zengtai and infiltrated towards the southwest of Nongan around 4:00 AM on the 14th. Shishimazhizi, ten li north of Huaide, was infiltrated by the Communist forces on the 12th, but was soon recovered by the Nationalist forces. Furthermore, over a hundred large and small wooden boats of the Communist army were discovered on the river surface west of Baiqitun on the opposite bank of the Songhua River, towing a large number of wooden planks, seemingly planning to build a pontoon bridge to cross the river. (2) After suffering losses for two days, the 12th and 13th, the morale of the Communist forces besieging Nongan plummeted. On the 14th, they completely withdrew from all strongholds more than fifteen li away from Nongan City. The suburbs were calm all day, and there was sufficient food and stable morale inside Nongan City.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] The advance troops of the Communist forces attacking Nongan, numbering about 5,000, infiltrated southwest and captured Shuangchengbao and Yangdachengzi (20 kilometers west of Huaide) on the same day. At the same time, about three regiments of reinforcements came from Changling and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Nationalist forces south of Yangdachengzi. Places such as Majia Chenjiagang north of Nongan have become a state of confrontation, and battles are taking place today. Furthermore, Youjiatun, east of Yongji, was infiltrated by a part of the 18th Division of the Communist army, numbering over 2,000. The situation there was unclear as of the evening of the 11th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Military News: According to confirmed reports, the Mongolian cavalry, two regiments, in Shuangchengbao mutinied entirely at 1:00 PM on the 12th and withdrew to the north of Shuangchengbao. The Nationalist forces are now trying to accommodate them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 14th] About 2,000 Communist forces, who had infiltrated westward from Jiangmifeng, approached the new Jilin Railway Station (10 kilometers north of Jilin) last night. The Nationalist forces took encirclement tactics overnight. By about 9:00 AM on the 14th, the Communist forces had broken out of the encirclement near Datun (12 kilometers north of Jilin), and the Nationalist forces are now tightly encircling them to annihilate them.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] The Communist forces besieging Wulajie started attacking the town on the morning of the 14th, and the defending troops gave them a fierce blow. The Communist forces' offensive was exhausted by noon, and key strongholds in Wulajie are still firmly held by the Nationalist forces.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] There was a fierce battle at Tiangang Railway Station, 80 li east of Jilin, last night, but news has since been cut off.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Arrives in Xinxiang</h3>
<p>Fighting Still Fierce in the Suburbs of Anyang</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Luoyang, 14th] Sun Dianying, commander of the Third Column, broke through the Communist siege after Tangyin was captured by the Communist forces and arrived in Jixian on the 6th. He has now arrived in Xinxiang and reported on the defense of the city. [Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 14th] Fighting is still fierce in the suburbs of Anyang.

<h3>Reasonable Suggestions to Promote Peace Never Rejected by the Government: Dong Xianguang Declares at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Regarding external reports that liberal elements in the Political Consultative Council (PCC) will launch a peace movement during the conference, Information Bureau Director Dong Xianguang declared at a press conference on the 14th that, as of now, the PCC Secretariat has not received any proposals related to the so-called peace movement. As for any reasonable suggestions to promote peace and unity, the government has never refused to consider them. However, past experiences have been very disappointing to the government, so empty talk of peace will not help the current situation. The government's approach to achieving unification and democracy will not change. Furthermore, the request by three PCC members, Xu Deheng and others, to Secretary-General Shao to dispatch a plane to welcome Communist Party PCC members to Nanjing to attend this session of the PCC has been replied to by Shao. If they intend to come to Nanjing, it will be easy to arrange. The text of Shao's reply to PCC members Xu Deheng, Zhou Binglin, and Qian Duansheng is as follows: "Your letter of the 6th was received yesterday afternoon. The meeting notice for the Communist Party PCC members has been forwarded via telegram to Mr. Wu Yunfu, who is working in the Xingzong of the Communist Party. If we receive a reply, then your proposal to send a plane to welcome them can be easily implemented. However, given the Communist Party's attitude towards the PCC in recent years and their rejection of General Zhang Wenbo's visit to Yan'an in January of this year, I fear there will be no positive response. I also worry that they will again label this proposal as a peace offensive and ridicule it, which would be not only useless but also harmful! I greatly admire your sincerity and profound insights. I will consult with the government in detail. I still hope you will come to Nanjing as soon as possible so that I can consult with you at any time. With best wishes, Shao Lizi bows."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 14th. Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the government's attitude towards the Democratic League?</p>
<p>Answer: The Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party have publicly denied the legitimacy of the Constitution and the National Assembly. The League has a close relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, which is rebelling against the government. Although it still claims to be a peaceful political party, the government's attitude towards the League will depend on its policies and actions.</p>
<p>Question: How many political parties are there in China, that is, besides those participating in the Political Consultative Conference, how many other parties are there? How many political parties that did not participate in the PCC are recognized by the government? Can political parties that did not participate in the PCC participate in elections?</p>
<p>Answer: Currently, in addition to the political parties participating in the PCC, there are also several other political parties active, but the exact number is difficult to determine. All citizens of the Republic of China can participate in the elections in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law, and it is not necessary for candidates to be nominated by political parties.</p>
<p>No Change in Xinjiang Situation; No News of Replacing Provincial Chairman</p>
<p>Question: What is the current situation in Xinjiang? How many central government troops are stationed in the province? It is rumored that Chairman Zhang Zhizhong will soon be transferred; is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no change in the situation in Xinjiang. I am not aware of any intention of the central government to replace Chairman Zhang.</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that Zhang Xueliang may be released in the near future. Is this statement accurate?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no new information to report regarding Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>Question: Has Li Huang given a definite answer on whether to accept or reject the position of Minister of Economic Affairs?</p>
<p>Answer: The government has not yet received a definite answer from Li Huang regarding his acceptance or rejection of the position of Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Question: Has a definite plan been formulated regarding the de-freezing of the cost of living index?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is still studying this issue.</p>
<p>Question: Since the end of the war, has foreign exchange been allocated to universities for the purchase of books and equipment? If so, what is the amount? Where does the funding for the Three Principles of the People Youth League come from?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the allocation of foreign exchange to subsidize universities for the purchase of books and equipment, US$200,000 was allocated in the US Lend-Lease Act in 1940, and US$800,000 was allocated in the US credit loan in 1941. However, due to transportation difficulties, the purchase and transportation have not yet been completed. In 1946, another US$500,000 in foreign exchange was allocated to various schools, but due to the promulgation of emergency economic measures, it has not yet been distributed. In the same year, an application was made to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for a subsidy of US$4 million for equipment for agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges that suffered losses due to the war. People are being sent to the United States to negotiate purchases and transportation. In 1947, US$800,000 in foreign exchange was also listed under the education budget and is being distributed. The Youth League's funding is no longer included in the national budget this year; thereafter, the party and league's funding will be self-raised and no longer borne by the government. When asked about the recent situation in the Shandong war, Director Fei replied that the government is satisfied with the recent progress in the Shandong war.</p>

<h3>New Dispute Between Britain, America, and Soviet Union to Arise Over Japan Peace Treaty Issue; US Denies Discussing with Other Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] When answering questions about rumors that Britain and the United States were discussing the Japanese peace treaty, a State Department spokesman said that the United States had not discussed this issue with any other country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] According to a report in today's Washington Post, the drafting and negotiation of the Japanese peace treaty will not go through the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The US and Britain have decided to break the old practice of the four powers drafting European treaties independently. Marshall believes that other countries that have fought with Japan must participate in the treaty process, starting from the initial drafting of the treaty if possible. Bevin also agreed to the above conclusion at the Moscow Conference. This opinion is the result of repeated opposition from Canada and Australia to the four or five powers monopolizing the initial stage of treaty negotiations. Bevin also assured the autonomous territories that the procedures for European treaties will not be repeated in the Far East. According to the report: Marshall is currently studying possible institutions to replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference in the Japanese peace treaty, but this point has not yet been decided. The Post stated: "Judging from various signs, the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission seems to be the institution for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, or at least an institution modeled after it. The opinions of Britain and the United States on the Japanese peace treaty seem certain to cause new disputes with the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union will undoubtedly oppose all eleven countries participating in the main process of drafting the treaty." The report said: Britain and the United States will directly refuse to exclude the above-mentioned countries from the process of concluding the treaty.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Star Line Ocean Liner Fails in Operation; Overseas Chinese Disappointed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 13th] The desire of overseas Chinese to return to their country on domestic ships, which they had eagerly hoped for, has been destroyed due to the operational failures of the Far Eastern Shipping Company. The company sent its first ship, the "Ocean"号, back and forth between Singapore and Shanghai (via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Bangkok). The company was recently established in Shanghai, and its capital is entirely owned by Chinese. A branch office was set up in Singapore, and overseas Chinese paid close attention to the company's news. Many overseas Chinese even gave up the opportunity to travel on foreign ships in order to travel on the company's new ship. Although the ship had changed its arrival date several times, they still waited patiently without complaint. The ship even sold pre-sale tickets before its arrival. However, the reality was completely contrary to the wishes of the overseas Chinese. First, the ship was originally built for sailing in cold regions, so its first-class cabins were specially set up around the machine room, which seemed too warm for sailing in tropical regions. Second, the water supply was insufficient, the sanitary facilities were very poor, and there was nothing to be comfortable about. Third, the company authorities only knew how to make money and did not care about the comfort and safety of passengers. The ship was officially only allowed to carry 300 passengers, but the company sold more than 1,000 tickets. In order to avoid trouble entering Hong Kong, the company even ordered the ship to stop at Xiamen first so that a large number of passengers could disembark before returning to Hong Kong to avoid complicated procedures. However, this plan was not approved by the Singapore authorities, so the ship, which was originally scheduled to leave here on the 10th, was not approved. The matter is still under negotiation, and the departure date has not been determined. Overseas Chinese are all悲愤, and local newspapers have also strongly criticized the company authorities' mishandling. This matter is not only a blow to the company's business, but also reduces the confidence of overseas Chinese in ships operated by Chinese.</p>

<h3>Debt Relations Between Central Bank and Government to be Cleared Up; In Order to Clarify Currency Issuance Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It is learned that the financial authorities will begin clearing up the debt relations between the Central Bank and the government in the near future in order to clarify the currency issuance situation. After this work is completed, it may be recommended to the highest authorities to make the issuance figures public to dispel doubts. Compared with the multiple of price increases, the amount of paper money issued in our country is very different. Generally, those who are unaware of this overestimate the amount of issuance, which is the main factor in the current economic instability. Some economic experts have long suggested making the issuance figures public.</p>
<h3>Tragic Murder, Robbery, and Arson Occurs in Shaoyang City, Hunan; Secretary of the Commissioner's Office Highly Suspected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 12th] A murder, robbery, and arson occurred in Shaoyang recently, with the secretary of the Xiangda District Commissioner's Office, Fu Deming, highly suspected of robbery and silencing witnesses, shocking the entire province. The Yonghe Gold Shop on Dongzhi Street in the county seat suddenly caught fire at about 5:00 AM on the 4th of this month. After it was extinguished, it was discovered that four people in the first shop room had been poisoned, and one person had been killed. A charred body was found in the middle fire scene, making it difficult to identify. Three people in the rear had been poisoned. After investigation, it was discovered that the murdered person was shop assistant Rao Wenqing, who had been stabbed fourteen times, with his flesh and blood blurred. After being treated and regaining consciousness, the poisoned shop assistants testified: At about 9:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, Secretary Fu from the Commissioner's Office came to the shop and immediately closed the door tightly. He showed a warrant from the Commissioner, which read, "All personnel of Yonghe Gold Shop are to be taken into custody." He then took out a package of pills with the words "Truth Pills" written on it and forced everyone to take ten pills each. Fearing his power, everyone except the manager, Rao Wenqing, swallowed the pills and fell unconscious. They knew nothing about the subsequent fire and murders. It is said that the shop manager, Tian Ruiqing, was falsely accused of being a Communist Party suspect some time ago. After being arrested and interrogated by the Commissioner's Office, he was soon released. During this period, someone threatened the shop, intending to extort money. The shop assistants used the excuse that the shop owner was not present, and their demands were not met, eventually leading to the tragic incident. It may have been the last resort of the gangsters, using arson, robbery, poisoning, and murder to silence witnesses. After the incident, Sixth District Commissioner Sun Zuoqi's attitude was ambiguous, and his words were partial to a certain person. To this day, he has not actively investigated the case. Local gentry and merchants are indignant and have organized a support association, calling for the swift punishment of the mastermind to avenge the dead. The county's local court has detained and interrogated Fu, believing that he is highly suspected. Newspapers in Changsha have published editorials expressing their anger, unanimously advocating for a thorough investigation and strict punishment to maintain discipline and stabilize public sentiment. The Hunan Provincial Government has sent a senior official to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Improvement in Rice Rationing Methods</h3>
<p>The city's improved measures for rice rationing have now been finalized: on one hand, price controls and forced sales are abolished to restore free trade in rice; on the other hand, localized rationing with price and quantity limits is implemented to stabilize people's livelihoods. These two methods, implemented simultaneously, have four advantages: (1) Unobstructed supply, preventing merchants from being hampered by the large gap between production and sales prices; (2) Natural adjustment, ensuring merchants can still earn legitimate profits; (3) The rationing system can restrain the free market, indirectly moderating prices; (4) Even if the rice market becomes erratic, workers, civil servants, teachers, students, and laborers can still receive rationed rice at reasonable prices, preventing panic. Therefore, before sufficient public rice is available for comprehensive rationing, this measure is reasonably satisfactory.</p>
<p>The rationing methods for workers and teachers/students have been officially announced; how to ration rice to the poor is still being planned. Based on past experiences with subsidized rice sales in various regions and the Social Affairs Bureau's subsidized flour program last year, several points are worth mentioning to the authorities and the public:</p>
<p>1.  The definition of "poor" must be clear and specific, making it easy for investigators and applicants to follow.</p>
<p>2.  The investigation process must rely on the heads of the Baojia (neighborhood units) in each district to take responsibility, ensuring diligence and preventing both omissions and over-inclusions, so that genuinely poor people can benefit.</p>
<p>3.  The register of the poor and subsidized rice coupons must be carefully prepared to facilitate inspection and prevent abuse.</p>
<p>4.  The distribution locations and times must be appropriately coordinated to maintain order and save the public from unnecessary travel.</p>
<p>5.  The most ideal method is to establish separate subsidized rice sale locations, managed with the help of local self-government personnel, to clearly delineate responsibilities. If entrusted to rice shops, the time period must be clearly specified; during that time, free trade should be temporarily suspended to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>6.  Sample rice, prices, dates, and locations must be clearly displayed or labeled so that the public is well informed.</p>
<p>7.  The district police and Baojia should jointly oversee order and inspection to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>The most crucial factors are accurate timing, simple procedures, and orderly execution. Past subsidized rice sales often encountered problems, invariably due to these issues. Achieving satisfactory results requires thorough preparation, cooperation among relevant agencies, and public adherence to order.</p>
<p>As for the free rice market, since the authorities have lifted price controls and local governments in production areas have allowed free circulation, fair trade can resume its normal state. However, to promote circulation and increase supply, we believe two matters are worth discussing.</p>
<p>First, regarding the review of purchase permits: rice is not a prohibited item, and if free purchase is allowed, why is it still necessary to apply for a purchase permit? And why does it still require verification and approval from the local government? Can't these unnecessary procedures be eliminated? Some believe that obtaining a purchase permit can avoid many difficulties and troubles, which is indeed helpful in practice. We also know that this is true, and even with a purchase permit, difficulties and troubles are sometimes unavoidable. This proves that free circulation has not been fully achieved in practice. We urge local governments to strictly adhere to government orders and make real improvements.</p>
<p>Second, regarding hoarding and bringing rice into the city: this city has a large population, and supply is sometimes insufficient, so there is a need to encourage bringing rice into the city. I remember that in the past, the municipal government had various incentive measures for bringing rice to Shanghai. To this day, they have not been explicitly canceled. Therefore, bringing rice to Shanghai should at least be freely permitted, regardless of whether the person is a rice merchant. According to Article 3 of the regulations prohibiting hoarding and speculation, only non-industry people who buy and store large quantities are prohibited, not those who transport it. Therefore, anyone bringing rice to Shanghai cannot be considered illegal. As for hoarding rice and speculating on prices, which harms the public's food supply, it is naturally unacceptable to the law. However, the meaning of "hoarding" is also somewhat ambiguous in the law. According to the term "large quantity" in the aforementioned article, what specific quantity constitutes a "large quantity" and "hoarding" seems to require clear definition. This easily causes disputes during enforcement, and those in the industry cannot help but feel uneasy and have many concerns. To facilitate the flow of supply, in addition to cracking down on hoarding and preventing speculation, it is also hoped that legitimate rice merchants will be protected to replenish reserves. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the government can further define the boundaries of hoarding appropriately and clearly so that legitimate merchants know what to do. This is of no small consequence to the future of the people's food supply.</p>

The third meeting will be held on the 16th, and the Democratic Party will submit issues related to food policy on that day. It is generally believed that there are no significant differences in the policies of the four parties, and it is hoped that an agreement can be reached at the third meeting.

<h3>US Senate Passes Bill Restricting Union Activities by a Majority Congress and Government Differ on Views</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The Senate today passed a labor bill restricting strikes and union activities by a vote of 68 to 24. The bill has previously been passed by the House of Representatives, and it will now be handed over to a joint committee of the two houses to reconcile the amendments passed by the two houses. The Senate's passage of the bill may cause the Republican-controlled Congress to have its first serious conflict with the government, as government spokesmen have made harsh criticisms and objections during the debate of the bill in both houses. Therefore, it is expected that the bill may be vetoed by the President when it is submitted for signature. After the veto, it should be returned to Congress for reconsideration. If the original bill is maintained by a two-thirds majority, it will become final. The Republican side is confident that it will be able to obtain this two-thirds majority in the reconsideration. Otherwise, they said they will never draft a new bill to cater to the White House's intentions.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu and Others Toiled Through the Night to Persuade Jiaotong University Students to Return to School Traffic on Both Lines Resumed to Normal Education Minister Zhu Gave Written Guarantee of Five Resolution Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The students of National Jiaotong University petitioned to Beijing to protest the Ministry of Education's decision to suspend the two departments of marine engineering and navigation. They were deadlocked at the North Station for a day and automatically drove the train to Zhenru late at night. After Education Minister Zhu Jiajun personally rushed to Zhenru to dissuade them, and after the efforts of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, President Wu, and Deputy Director Ling and Director Zhao of the Alumni Association, the issue was resolved at about 8 a.m. yesterday. All the students were then transported back to the school by dozens of trucks dispatched by the Municipal Government, but the entire school continued to strike yesterday.</p>
<p>At about 2 a.m. yesterday, Minister Zhu rushed to the Jiao Tong University petitioner train at Zhenru and broadcast to the students: "Your request has been promised, I hope you will return to school quickly." But at that time, the students were still not satisfied and insisted on continuing to petition to Beijing. After Minister Zhu finished speaking, he returned to the urban area. Mayor Wu and Jiao Tong University alumni, professors, etc. continued to persuade with painstaking efforts. After repeated explanations, the student representatives stated: the five solutions and the revision of the independent establishment of the marine engineering department, agreed upon by Tian Ciwei and Jiao Tong University professors on the morning of the day before yesterday, must obtain a written guarantee from Minister Zhu. Secondly, the students' request to increase school building facilities, increase the number of publicly funded quotas, and the merger of Tangshan Branch and Peiping Railway Management College into Jiaotong University must still be achieved. The alumni and professors present immediately guaranteed that the Alumni Association would be responsible for negotiating the requests for increased school building and other requests, and persuaded the students to take the overall situation into consideration and jointly maintain the school's reputation. On the one hand, Mayor Wu rushed back to Minister Zhu to obtain the Minister's handwritten signature approving the five replies and brought it to the students. At this point, all the students, after voting, finally dismissed the idea of ​​insisting on petitioning to Beijing and were sent back to the school in batches by trucks from the Municipal Government. It was already dawn when the mayor and others returned. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter drove to Jiaotong University. The gate was quiet, and most of the students had returned home or were resting in the dormitory. Some students were saying that if the remaining requirements could not be achieved, they would strike for a long time, but several fourth-year students who were about to graduate told reporters that they hoped to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The reporter went to President Wu Baofeng's private residence, intending to ask how to deal with the students continuing to strike.

<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua and Supervisor Chen Dongyuan, having handled the Jiaotong University disturbance in Shanghai, flew back to the capital at 2:30 PM on the 14th. After returning to Beijing, Minister Zhu discussed the matter with Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and other relevant personnel. At 10:00 PM, the Ministry of Education spokesman issued the following statement regarding the handling of the Jiaotong University disturbance: This time, the Jiaotong University students made certain requests to the Ministry regarding various administrative issues of the school. Due to not fully understanding the facts, or because of misinformation, there were distortions and misunderstandings, leading to strikes and petitions, gathering at the railway station, and disrupting traffic. Minister Zhu went to Shanghai, earnestly persuaded them, and the matter has been resolved. The demands made by the Jiaotong University students this time are:</p>
<p>Issue of Changing the School Name</p>
<p>(1) Opposition to changing the school name and merging with the College of Management. The Ministry has never considered this proposal. Former President Wu Baofeng publicly clarified this, and Minister Zhu also stated in a letter to Dean Zhong of the College of Management that the various departments of the school should develop in a balanced manner and should not be treated differently.</p>
<p>Issue of Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the claim that Jiaotong University's funding should be treated equally with other schools, the Ministry has always valued Jiaotong University's long history and past achievements. Since the restoration, it has made every effort to raise funds and equipment to develop the school. There is absolutely no favoritism. The difficulties felt by the school are common to all schools, and the Ministry is constantly planning and seeking to overcome them.</p>
<p>Issue of Navigation and Marine Engineering Departments</p>
<p>(3) Request to continue running the navigation and marine engineering departments. These two departments are purely technical in nature and not comparable to the departments of ordinary universities. Jiaotong University had a navigation department at the end of the Guangxu era, but when the Wusong Merchant Marine School was established, the department was merged into the Merchant Marine School. This has been the case for more than 30 years. During the Anti-Japanese War, Jiaotong University moved inland to Chongqing, and the Wusong Merchant Marine School also moved to Chongqing at this time. Later, the school was temporarily suspended due to various reasons, so the navigation and marine engineering departments were temporarily entrusted to Jiaotong University to run. After the victory, the Ministry responded to requests from all parties, and the Merchant Marine School moved back to Shanghai, so the two departments were ordered to return to the school to avoid dispersing talent and resources and to take into account the educational system. Regarding the current issue of the two departments, President Wu has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry for approval to continue running them, and individual alumni of Jiaotong University have also expressed similar opinions. After repeated discussions, Vice Minister Tian went to the school to discuss the substantive aspects of education in both departments. The Ministry approved the merger of the marine engineering department into the shipbuilding department, renamed the shipbuilding and marine engineering department, which still belongs to the College of Engineering. The navigation department was renamed the maritime management department, which belongs to the College of Management. All of the above issues are within the scope of school administration, and once explained, they are easily resolved. During this trip to Shanghai, Minister Zhu encouraged the students of the school to recognize the times and not to abandon their conscience and abilities through out-of-bounds actions, and not to neglect their studies because of suggestions. Once the truth is clear, the above issues can be satisfactorily resolved. (See page 4)</p>

They have resolved not to resume classes until their demands are met. On the evening of the 14th, the school authorities adopted a method of individual persuasion, with the heads of each department convening talks with students of their respective departments in the hope of encouraging them to resume classes voluntarily. However, the students resolved to implement their original plan on the 15th and petition the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, and the National Government again.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Zheng Lun basketball team played against Chen You last night at 7:00 PM, winning the first game with a score of 57 to 38. The audience was quite lively. At the beginning of the first half, the visiting team was unfamiliar with the basket, and the ball often turned around the rim without going in, so Chen You showed some prominence. By ten minutes, Zheng Lun had achieved a balanced situation, and after fifteen minutes, they surpassed them. In the first half, they relied only on Cai, Tu, and Yu to score points. In the second half, Zheng Lun became more and more courageous, and the score rose steadily.</p>
<p>Abundant Strength</p>
<p>The visiting team was polite, passed the ball often and quickly. Team captain Cai Zhongqiang's command, Tu Wenlong's rebounding and shooting, and Yu Ruizhang's agility and shooting were the backbone of the team. The team was full of strength, and their calmness in the face of adversity and their composure when they were behind were their strengths.</p>

<p>Chen You presented a flag to Zheng Lun before the game to show their friendship. After the two sides made contact at 7:00 PM, Wang Bingfu missed a free throw, and Zheng Lun's Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang quickly scored three points. Chen You's Wang Bingfu then threw in a ball. The starting lineup for Zheng Lun was Cheng Fei, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Yu Ruizhang. Chen You's lineup was Wang Bingfu, Wang Rongsheng, Zhang Jinwu, He Zeng, and Fu Qixia. After five minutes, Zheng Lun took the lead 7-6. By the time they fought to ten minutes, the score was tied twice at 12-12 and 14-14. Chen You's Shi Jiuquan replaced Zhang Jinxuan, and Yu Ruizhang led Zheng Lun by three points (17-14). Zhang Jinxuan replaced Wang Rongsheng again, and Chen You was 16-18, catching up. The visiting team's Wang Donghuan replaced Cheng Fei, attacking with short passes, and the situation gradually improved. Zheng Lun led by two points at 23-21.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, there was a melee for three minutes. Zheng Lun's Cai and Tu scored, 29-23. Chen You took another timeout. Wang Bingfu replaced Zhang Jinxuan, and Zheng Lun had smooth sailing, leading by as much as 13 points (36-23) within 12 minutes. During this period, Chen You scored two consecutive goals, seemingly making a comeback. The two sides remained average, and at 48-34, Zheng Lun became more and more courageous, while the opponent sometimes took a "wait-and-see attitude." Although they adjusted their lineup, it was difficult to resist. The last four minutes were 49-34, and the situation was set. As a result, Zheng Lun won the first battle with a score of 57 to 38.</p>
<p>Zheng Lun, Fouls, Chen You, Fouls</p>
<p>Cheng Fei, 10, Wang Bingfu, 16</p>

<p>White Rice Price at 168,000</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, told reporters yesterday: The price of rice for this allocation is 168,000 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) for white rice and 147,000 yuan per shi for foreign indica rice. The first batch of allocations will mostly be white rice, and later allocations will mostly be foreign indica rice. Applicants cannot specify which type of rice they want. The total monthly rice ration needed for students, teachers, staff, and workers in the city is approximately 200,000 dan (another unit of dry measure). Applications and allocations will be processed simultaneously each month, and there is no set deadline. These allocation measures will be maintained until the new rice harvest, and a decision will be made at that time whether to continue them. The distribution of rations to impoverished households will begin with slum dwellers. Detailed measures are being drafted and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Indica Rice Sales Are the Most Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 7,700 shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets, including indica rice from Bengbu and Wuhu. Market transactions were normal, and the prices of both japonica and indica rice in the North and South markets fell uniformly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice sales were the most sluggish. Baiyuan and Yinyuan also fell by 10,000 yuan. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 300,000 to 305,000 yuan, medium-quality rice at 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 285,000 to 290,000 yuan. High-quality Bo rice was priced at 295,000 to 300,000 yuan, medium-quality rice at 290,000 to 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 285,000 to 290,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Fishing and Salt in Liaodong</h3>
<p>— Shenyang, 4th (Airmail) Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>The Northeast is a land of plenty, and most of China's boundless resources are in the Northeast. Besides its vast mineral deposits, along its six-hundred-mile coastline, there are abundant fisheries and salt production, enough to supplement the people's food and the needs of the chemical industry. Their economic value is extremely precious.</p>
<p>Decline in Fisheries Statistics</p>
<p>I have just returned from Liaodong. According to my investigation, the fishing and salt regions ravaged by war are already decaying and there is little hope for recovery in the near future. Fisheries in particular are declining rapidly. During the enemy puppet period, there was considerable development to meet the needs of the Japanese. Around 1940-1941, the total fish production in the Northeast was about 100,000 tons per year, with marine fish and freshwater fish each accounting for half. Marine fish were mainly produced in Gaiping, and freshwater fish were mainly produced in Damai. According to recent statistics, there are 14,767 fishermen on the Liaodong Peninsula, with 2,992 non-powered sailboats and 3 powered mechanical boats. Fishing methods are also very primitive, using quick hooks, nets, and wind nets, so production is not high. According to statistics from Yingkou alone in 1946: 1,550 fishermen could catch 3.43 million catties of fish in a year. (Except for Dalian, there is not a single fishing port with modern facilities.)</p>
<p>Fishermen Poor for Generations</p>
<p>"A fisherman's family is poor for generations." During the puppet Manchukuo era, fishermen were also subjected to the "shipment" system of plunder. After liberation, because of the incessant warfare, the interests of fishermen were even more damaged in the free seas and markets. The current living standards of ordinary fishermen are below the poverty line. In addition to paying fishing taxes and boat taxes, the fish they catch are sent to the "fish beds" in the market, where they are exploited by fishmongers for double the profit. At the same time, they must also dedicate part of their hard-earned fruits to the elusive "reed forest" heroes. Currently, the safety of fishermen is not guaranteed. The fishing season is from March to November, but during the harsh winter months of the Lunar New Year, fishermen must find a way to catch a kind of fresh, flat fish to give to the boat owner.</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Boats Sail In</p>
<p>On the sea surface where the morning light is dawning, the sea breeze blows the new fishing light song circulating on the fishermen's lips, which says: Tell MacArthur, we oppose Japanese fishing boats sailing into Chinese waters, we are no longer slaves! We demand that Japan compensate for a large number of fishing boats to compensate for the anemia of fishermen who have been oppressed. As the sun rises from the curtain of deep mist in the east, our bright eyes are watching the Japanese fishing boats.</p>
<p>The Northeast is already facing a salt shortage because production cannot be restored and salt stocks have been exhausted. Salt production in the Northeast reaches 30 million dan, but local needs are only 6 million dan. Two-thirds of the salt is produced in the Far East Peninsula. The largest salt factories are in Yinggai, Fuxian, and Jinzhou. In addition, Zhuanghe, Jinxi, Suifeng, Panshan, and Xingcheng are smaller in scale, and the construction of Suifeng salt is the most modern. Unfortunately, the factory equipment was destroyed by the Communists. The received salt stocks were 970,000 dan for Yinggai Factory, 2.6 million dan for Fuxian Factory, and about 1 million dan for Jinxi, Zhuanghe, Suifeng, Panshan, Xingcheng, etc. After one year, the salt stocks have been used up, and the factories cannot restore production, so salt has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>Electricity Shortage Affects Production</p>
<p>Taking Yinggai as an example, the annual production during the puppet era was 150,000 tons, but this year's production will hardly reach 70,000 tons. This salt factory is located at the mouth of the Liao River to Gaiping, a length of 70 li. The area of the official and merchant salt fields is 1,612 fu (each fu equals 1.5 hectares), and the degree of damage reaches 80%. Complete restoration requires 850 million circulation notes and cannot be restored in the short term. The electrical equipment has been completely destroyed. Currently, it is only possible to use the tide trapped in the salt fields to make salt, so the output is naturally small.</p>
<p>High Grain Prices Affect Treatment</p>
<p>The lives of salt workers are even more impoverished. Their treatment is difficult to sustain even themselves, let alone their wives and children. The monthly salary for foremen is 9,500 yuan, 9,000 yuan for spinners, 8,500 yuan for strikers, and 8,000 yuan for salt workers. The price of sorghum rice in Yinggai is 120 yuan per catty, so with such a pitiful salary, one can only buy 67 catties of sorghum rice per month. According to Mr. Yang Shilin, director of the Yinggai Salt Factory, "We are trying our best to find ways to improve the treatment of salt workers, but there are many difficulties. We are thinking of providing workers with supplies in kind. If we can achieve this, each worker can receive 250 catties of sorghum rice per month." Amidst soaring grain prices, the most urgent need in the salt region is rice.</p>

<h3>Social Aspects of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou, 3rd (Airmail) Our Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>For nearly half a month, persistent heavy rain has made the usually quiet city of Fuzhou appear even more simple and pale. Pedestrians are sparse. Sima Qian wrote "Chongqing Guest" to describe the streets of Chongqing in the rain, full of "mushrooms." In rainy Fuzhou, it is hard to see one or two people wearing raincoats among ten people. Most of them are carrying the famous Fuzhou-made umbrellas, and are the streets not full of "special products"?</p>
<p>In the past, there was a long drought with no rain, and rice prices soared. However, after half a month of heavy rain, rice prices are still rising. Rice merchants say that the mountain streams have flooded, and rice boats from northern Fujian cannot travel downstream, so the source is lacking. This has also become an excuse for high rice prices. Ordinary people cannot help but sigh!</p>
<p>High Rice Prices Lead to Affordable Meals</p>
<p>The Fuzhou City Party Headquarters recently partnered with the Fujian Office of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to open an affordable canteen. This is indeed a blessing in a place without a "set meal" system. It provides 1,000 meals per day, each costing 1,000 yuan, with one vegetable dish, one soup, and ten taels of white rice. Amidst the soaring prices, this is cheap. The canteen is crowded with customers every day, mostly junior civil servants, students, and laborers. They line up to buy tickets and take their seats. Those who arrive late often regret their lateness. In this gap, we can see the difficulty of life for the average person in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>People in Fuzhou have the elegant hobby of strolling on "South Street." At night, the streets are bustling, but unfortunately, there has been a power outage recently, and it is dark and dim. Recently, the weather has been clear with a bright moon, and citizens stroll the streets by moonlight, which is quite interesting. The Fuzhou City Police Bureau has asked each Baojia to hang oil lamps at night to maintain night security in order to prevent small-scale activities.</p>
<p>A Bomb Scare Alarms Officials</p>
<p>A construction worker in the provincial government recently discovered a buried bomb while digging soil to repair a corridor. Chaos erupted instantly, alarming officials in the government, and employees fled. The bomb was about fifteen centimeters square, and the casing was heavily rusted, as if it had been buried for a long time. Where did this bomb come from? Some said it was buried by the enemy when they left, and some said it was a bomb dropped by enemy planes during the war that did not explode. There were many rumors. Later, the Security Command sent engineers to excavate and found that it was actually a large piece of bomb shrapnel buried in the ground, causing a false alarm and also a small amusing incident.</p>
<p>Summer is Approaching, Garbage is a Concern</p>
<p>Fuzhou City does not have a tap water system, which has created many problems. The recent epidemics are mainly due to citizens drinking unclean well water, and fires are often severely disastrous due to the limited water source. Even as summer approaches and citizens' water consumption increases, some areas have wells that have dried up. It is strange that a city located by the sea has come to fear water. Recently, some people in Fuzhou City have paid attention to the garbage problem, because garbage piles up everywhere, emitting a foul odor, which has a negative impact on the health of citizens. Fuzhou newspapers questioned where the more than 300 sanitation workers of the municipal government have gone. If this continues, will this garden city not become a garbage city? However, the ancient site of Minglun Hall has indeed become a garbage dump. Nearby schools and residents have protested. It is said that students at the nearby Central Elementary School have contracted meningitis, which is related to the garbage.</p>
<p>Huaqing Hot Springs Offer Bathing in the Spring Cold</p>
<p>Fuzhou is a city of hot springs. Starting from Tangbian Township in the northeast of the city and moving southeast to the vicinity of Wangzhuang, the area stretches for more than 10,000 feet. The vastness of the area is the greatest in the southeastern provinces. The northeast gate of Fuzhou is called Tangmen, which is named after the hot springs. In the Tangmen area, wells are dug, and spring water flows out in abundance. Bathhouses stand in rows. "Huaqing Hot Springs, bath bestowed in the spring cold" has been a beautiful story for thousands of years. People from other places who come to Fuzhou for the first time all express envy for the convenience and comfort of bathing in Fuzhou. Fuzhou's bathhouses serve the same function as Sichuan's teahouses: resolving lawsuits, chatting to relieve worries, the bathhouse is a great place to go. The hot springs contain sulfur and have an average temperature of more than 60 degrees Celsius, which has the ability to kill bacteria and can treat skin diseases.</p>

<p>Please Crack Down on Black Market Ticket Scalpers at the Station</p>
<p>Editor: I am a rickshaw puller. At first, the two of us who pulled the rickshaw could make a living. Unexpectedly, not only is rice expensive, but black market ticket scalpers are also very active inside the train station (black market ticket scalpers are another name for rickshaw and handcart touts). There are forty to fifty black market ticket scalpers at the North Station in this city. When a train arrives in Shanghai and passengers disembark, they ask passengers to solicit those willing to ride, and then they negotiate the fare. They profit from it. For example, if a passenger is willing to pay 10,000 yuan for a ride, the black market ticket scalper will introduce the customer to us, and we only get 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The rest goes into the black market ticket scalper's pocket. Passengers who are not seasoned travelers are often defrauded by them, either by paying more for the fare or by losing their luggage. Rickshaw pullers are not allowed to enter the train station because the first police don't allow it, and the second they sneak in to pick up passengers, the rickshaws are placed outside and are often damaged or the tires are punctured (this is called injecting medicine), which is clearly a trick of the black market ticket scalpers. We hope that the railway authorities and the municipal police agencies will severely crack down on these black market ticket scalpers to avoid adding another layer of exploitation to our hard-working rickshaw pullers.

<h3>After Reading "Words on the Human World"</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jing'an of Haining, his ci (a type of Chinese poetry) style is elegant, his poetry is clear and unique, he is learned and eloquent, and his name is known throughout the world. His scholarship in ci poetry is equal to that of San Yuan the Elder, and his skill in textual analysis is comparable to that of Mr. Tai Yan, worthy of being passed down through generations. It is a pity that due to national difficulties and family sorrows, he threw himself into Kunming Pool. Such a talented man became a Chu minister. His plight under Luo Zhenyu also shows that his noble character is difficult to be swayed by worldly customs. His book "Words on the Human World" is highly regarded in the world of ci poetry because, as Yu Pingbo said, "One must be in the midst of the game to know the joys and sorrows; one must also be outside the game to have a fair judgment." Therefore, he is able to enter deeply and see the true face, gaining respect in the realm of ci poetry. He states clearly in the introduction:</p>
<p>"Ci poetry values realm above all else. With realm, it naturally forms a high style and famous lines. This is why the ci poetry of the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty is uniquely excellent."</p>
<p>People often value Bai Shi and Mei Cheng, but they do not know that Bai Shi's "swallows lightly dance, orioles sweetly sing" has a feminine air. Its fragrance, compared to Fei Qing's "screen with golden partridges," precisely hits the mark: "delicate clouds piled on pillows, hairpins placed sideways, melted spring water, willow catkin dreams." Duan Ji's "the person by the stove is like the moon, her white wrist like frozen snow…" appears petty in comparison. Even his two poems "Secret Fragrance" and "Sparse Shadow" have the appearance of small still life paintings, not as majestic and dignified as the Grand Master's large oil portrait.</p>
<p>"The realm of 'no self' can only be attained in stillness; the realm of 'self' can only be attained in the stillness within movement. Therefore, one is beautiful, and the other is magnificent."</p>
<p>Jing'an's words can only be spoken by those who deeply understand the joys and sorrows within. Only by forgetting the self can we avoid forcing harmony with nature, and instead feel joy and be intimately connected with heaven and earth. However, the realm of "no self" also has levels of high and low. "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Southern Mountains" and "The music ends, but the person is gone, only several green peaks remain above the river" are of the highest quality. "Cold waves faintly rise, white birds leisurely descend" and "Fine rain, fish come out, gentle breeze, swallows fly diagonally" are of medium quality. Why? Because the former ten characters do not deliberately create a phenomenon, truly seamless. Its high quality lies in truly desiring to speak of the Way and then speaking of it. Although "cold waves, white birds" are praised for their rising and appearing, and "fish, swallows" are praised for their coming out and flying diagonally, they are all intentionally done. Sima Biao, the Sage of Writing, said, "Without using a single word, one can attain elegance," which originally lies in using words without being attached to skillfulness, and skillfulness naturally appears. "Several green peaks bitterly, scattered twilight words…" although derived from "Several green peaks remain above the river," when compared, the difference is clear. As for Xie Tiao's "Clear river is as still as silk," when Li Bai continued it with "Loving the way, the clear river is as still as silk, it makes people often remember Xie Xuanhui," it feels like adding feet to a snake. Therefore, those with high style cannot be added to or subtracted from. For example, Yong Shu added to Zhu Qingyu's: "After making up, she lowers her voice and asks her husband, 'Is my painted eyebrow fashionable?'" with:</p>
<p>"Phoenix hairpins with golden mud, dragon-patterned jade palm combs; going back and forth, laughing with fans covering their faces, asking, 'Is my painted eyebrow fashionable?' Playing with the brush, scaring people for a long time, first trying her hand at painting flowers; casually preventing embroidered work, laughing and asking, 'How do you write the two characters for mandarin duck?'"</p>
<p>The former is delicate and affectionate, but the change makes it a bit "sultry."</p>
<p>"Tearful eyes ask flowers, flowers do not speak, scattered reds fly past the swing" and "Holding hands, looking at each other with tearful eyes, finally speechless, choking with sobs…" both have the realm of "self," but the loneliness and wistfulness of tearful eyes asking flowers and flowers flying away cannot be imitated by Liu Qi's ci poetry. In common parlance, Liu Qi is clear and understandable, approachable. Therefore, "where there is well water, there is song of Liu Qi's ci poetry." In terms of ci poetry quality, Yong Guan's ci poetry is innocent and untainted, clearly understanding in the heart. Therefore, there are high-quality works within the realm of "self," and there are also high-quality works within the realm of "no self." As for "Green willow shadows reveal the swing," "Red apricot branches are full of spring…" the wording is stable and lovely, but when compared to innocence, it is inferior.</p>
<h3>Discussing "Science for the Masses"</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianguang</p>
<p>A Kind of Popular Science Reading Material Rooted in China</p>
<p>World science is advancing with great strides. What about Chinese science? Generally speaking, the situation is quite bleak. Speaking solely in terms of academics, existing academic institutions are all clinging to the old and unwilling to change. There is no need to talk about the revitalization of the academic atmosphere. From the May Fourth Movement to today, science is still the exclusive domain of a small number of "scholars." The transmission of science mainly relies on writing. The general public cannot even read characters, let alone understand newspapers. How can we talk about understanding science and learning science? Moreover, the spread of science has always been limited to a few cities, targeting students. As a result, in places like Shanghai, there are still people who seek gods and ask for fortunes when they are sick, not to mention other more impoverished and remote areas. However, can you say that the Chinese people do not need science? That is not the case. The Chinese people not only need science to enrich their way of life and improve their production technology, but scientific methods and training also help them in their thinking and behavior. In my personal opinion, China currently allows for the establishment of atomic energy research institutes and mathematical research centers to showcase the country's honor, but popularizing scientific knowledge to the masses across the country and making science accessible to the public is more urgent and beneficial for us.</p>
<p>Scientific Writing Urgently Needs Attention</p>
<p>Based on this understanding, I would like to discuss the recently published monthly magazine "Science for the Masses." This magazine has only published seven issues so far, but it has already attracted considerable attention in the reading community, the scientific community, and the business community. It is said to be a fast-selling publication on Wangping Street. It is fortunate that popular science publications can sell well, indicating an increasing public interest in science. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the style of "Science for the Masses" is more closely aligned with popularization as an important factor. Reading "Science for the Masses," few people will not appreciate the fluency of the articles inside, with many small subtitles that are easy to memorize. Many people often feel that science is profound, but rather than saying that science is profound, it would be better to say that general scientific writing is difficult to understand. Chinese people who study science must read books. Initially, only foreign books were available. Gradually, Chinese science books emerged, but because most of the scientists who wrote them did not pay attention to writing, those who understood English still habitually read English books, while those who did not understand English still had no way to enter the hall of science. Chinese people either do not want science, or if they want science, they must have their own scientific books in their own language, and this language must not be stiff or stagnant. Whether the writing in "Science for the Masses" can serve as a model for future scientific writing still needs to be carefully examined. Generally speaking, its writing is as simple and fluent as ordinary comprehensive publications.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think that the large-scale use of illustrations in "Science for the Masses" is commendable. Today's characters originally evolved from images, and there are many places where words cannot explain clearly, but a picture can explain clearly. Objectively studying the interests of the general public, pictures are more attractive than words. For example, the April issue of "Science for the Masses" has a report on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a plan of the entire line attached. I think that people in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, even if they can count the names of each station on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, few people probably know how this third major road goes. This picture is very effective in introducing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The magazine pays great attention to the collection of pictures. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the news offices of several embassies regularly provide them with materials and photos, which is a very meaningful cooperation.</p>
<p>Introducing the Domestic Construction Situation</p>
<p>Flipping through "Science for the Masses," I feel that they seem to be working in two directions in parallel, namely, "introducing the domestic construction situation and expounding on the progress of world science." In terms of world science, the magazine's February issue (actually sold at the end of January), "World Science in 1946" special issue, can be taken as a representative. In a small space, it introduced the achievements of world science in the past year, industrial products, and the Nobel Prize winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine and health. Regardless of the time saved or the way of expression, it is very appropriate. The introduction of the domestic construction situation, "Science for the Masses," has maintained from the first issue to the present. The April issue is an introduction to Fushun. A friend who is engaged in international cultural exchange talked to me and said that foreign science magazines are often sent, but it is rare to have a few types of Chinese science magazines that can be taken out. Why? The entire book is translated from foreign countries and sent to foreign countries. Are you asking them to translate it back? "Science for the Masses" also inevitably suffers from this problem. It also has many articles taken from foreign magazines, but the first one or two articles in each issue, if taken out, are also something, their own materials, their own photos, may wish to introduce to foreign friends. Articles like this should only be too few, not too many.</p>
<p>Long Serializations are Not Very Suitable</p>
<p>"Science for the Masses" devotes a considerable amount of space to articles on medicine and physiology. Recently, it has also added a column, "Public Medicine and Health Consultant," which may be because they are focusing on the health and conservation of the nation. Several basic science lectures are very suitable for science teaching materials in secondary schools, but appearing once a month may take too long. "Wandering in the Wonders of Science" is not very new and is not a very suitable long serialization. In addition, there are fewer articles on pure science than articles on applied science, and there are no articles on agriculture. Chinese scientists who are working hard in these disciplines seem to be able to give them a little help.</p>
<p>"Science for the Masses" is a magazine that still inevitably uses text as a technique. The requirement of popularizing science is that the closer it is to the masses, the more ideal it is. Through its text, illustrations, and price, it can be considered to be approaching the road of popularization in comparison. However, in today's China, I am afraid that only young people have the ability and habit of reading. How many copies can reach the hands of the real masses, and what fraction can be absorbed and adopted by them? In undertaking the work of popularizing science, can "Science for the Masses" be satisfied with its current work? This is worth thinking deeply and deliberating on by the magazine and scientists across the country.</p>
<h3>Fundamentals of World Geography (Written by Chen Yuan, Jian Guo Bookstore Edition)</h3>
<p>— Na Ya</p>
<p>In today's world where geographical reading materials are very scarce—although there are still a few books on geography, generally speaking, it is scarce. Now, the several geography works in the Jian Guo Middle School Student Reading Series, with their popular and accurate content, are indeed works that relieve the famine of scarcity. Among them, Chen Yuan's book, "Fundamentals of World Geography," has the best content.</p>
<p>The form of this book is very lively, but the content is very rich. It does not have the rigid fixed principles of ordinary geography works, which make readers feel bored and have headaches. Instead, it naturally explains the geographical foundations of the world: including land, people, climate, transportation, and resources. Although each department is explained briefly, it is very clear. Indeed, this book is better than the author's other book, "Tales of Regular World Geography."</p>
<p>The author's handling of this work is very lively and interesting. He starts by mentioning the world of water, and first interestingly says: "If the ocean were to dry up one day, what do you think would happen?" Then, he explains the problem one by one, and also describes the importance of the ocean and the distribution of the ocean, the five major oceans, rivers, famous rivers, canals, lakes, etc., all based on the latest materials, and clearly stated.</p>
<p>Geographical works were originally very dull, but the author adopted a new and lively way of writing, so that readers not only do not feel dull, but only feel fresh, lively, and readable. This method can be said to be a great success.</p>
<p>The author then continues to explain the geography of terrain, continents, climate, humans, transportation, and crops, the geography of power resources, and the geography of metal and non-metal resources in the same way. In each of the above departments, the author divided many sections to fully describe them.</p>
<h3>Review of "Guidance for Studying in the United States"</h3>
<p>— Li Xuezhong</p>
<p>Compiled by Liu Zhihong, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Our country has had students studying in the United States since the late Qing Dynasty, so the time cannot be considered late. The number of people who have completed their studies and returned to the country is unknown, but there is little introduction to the situation of American universities to the Chinese people. In the past, it can be said that there were no dedicated authors. Our country's embassies and consulates abroad are all busy with international negotiations, overseas Chinese issues, and commercial matters, so they have no time to investigate the internal affairs of universities in various countries. Therefore, although students in domestic universities are eager to know the situation of American universities, they have no way to obtain it, and those who want to study in the United States feel even more depressed. Because they know almost nothing about the situation of American schools, they often make mistakes in applying to schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhihong, a former professor at Northeastern University, based on his personal experience and the results of his observations in the United States, compiled the book "Guidance for Studying in the United States," which is about 100,000 words. The book describes everything from preparing for departure procedures to completing studies and returning to the country. It covers almost all the matters that American students want to know.</p>
<p>The main parts of this book are the general overview of American institutions of higher learning, the analysis of university departments, and the general discussion of research institutes in three chapters. In these three chapters, the organization of American universities, the advantages and disadvantages of each school and department, and the examination methods for doctoral and master's degrees are all described in great detail. In addition, there are also special chapters detailing all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, American university student life, and British and American customs during the stay in the United States. Therefore, those who intend to study in the United States really need to read this book.</p>
<h3>Waves Washing Sand</h3>
<p>— Maple Leaf</p>
<p>Written by Shu Yan, published by Wan Ye Bookstore</p>
<p>China, which has suffered many disasters, is now encountering a fate similar to that of fifty years ago. That was the time when the Sino-Japanese War was defeated, prompting the Reform Movement of 1898, and new forces and old trends were launching a head-on collision; soon after, the Boxer Rebellion plunged the entire country into a precarious state. Today, although the War of Resistance has been won, the chaotic domestic situation has prevented the national construction plan, which is related to the fate of hundreds of millions of people, from proceeding smoothly. Therefore, the critical moment of "survival or extinction" is once again placed before the Chinese people!</p>
<p>Those who are aware of this crisis will certainly not remain silent. In Mr. Shu Yan's Waves Washing Sand, he tells us a story from fifty years ago, while also making us feel the shadow of today's China.</p>
<p>Waves Washing Sand is a recently published play. The story takes place in the home of Xia Yongqing, a former Left Deputy Censor of the Qing Dynasty. The stubborn, stubborn, arrogant, and conservative "important minister," filled with "ethical principles" and "Confucian morality," cannot hold back the new generation awakened by the tides of the times. His eldest son, Xia Duosheng, is very close to Tan Sitong, one of the "Six Gentlemen"; the second son, Duomin, has accepted the baptism of the Father of the Nation's Revive China Society.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War was defeated. Young people were stimulated. Just as the "heavily responsible frontier envoys" were singing and dancing, they were also lamenting "the declining morals of the people." "Reform" was implemented under the leadership of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. The edict of "change the law" shattered the dreams of "red-capped and peacock-feathered" officials. During this period, Xia Duosheng was also playing a key role. His younger brother, although not taking action, was actively working.</p>
<p>However, history proved that Kang and Liang's route was not correct. Relying on the four-character magic formula of "delaying and postponing" and insidious and vicious means, the "ministers" united under the "common suffering" of everyone being in danger, and finally caused the "Reform Movement of 1898." Xia Duosheng fell out with his father; and after the death of the "Six Gentlemen," he left. The stubborn conservatives won a complete victory, and politics became even worse. Even under the support of the "court," the "Boxers" were produced, leading to the disaster of the "Eight-Nation Alliance."</p>
<p>Not submerged by "reform," he was finally overwhelmed by "foreign troubles." Xia Yongqing, the old official who was "implicated" by his son and dismissed from office, could only escape to the Shanghai Concession after the capital was moved west and the capital city fell, to live a life of "enjoying his old age." Duomin continued his work in Shanghai. Duosheng also changed his previous wrong policy and joined the Revive China Society to work for the British life. At this time, Xia Yongqing suffered a stroke and died, and the whole play ended here.</p>
<p>With such a serious story as the theme, threading in many "aristocratic" family lives and relationships, the overall plot of the play is still very compact and impeccable. The freshness and fluency of the words, of course, need not be said.</p>
<p>Especially in writing techniques, the "symbolic method" is constantly applied from beginning to end, and it achieves the effect of "inspiring deep thought." The whole description is vivid and the powerful ending is like thunder… In every way, it makes people feel that this is a good book worth recommending.</p>
<p>According to the author's statement in the foreword, there is a sequel to this Waves Washing Sand. "Drunken Peace" is about the era from the success of the revolution to the Great Revolution of 1927; Ode to Revival is a side view of the days from the September 18 Incident to the victory of the War of Resistance. However, we believe that judging from this play alone, it is enough to be a mirror of China today.</p>
<p>Using the author's own words to clarify the significance of this play is "to write about the suffering, resistance, and revival of the Chinese nation in the past half century from the story of a family of officials." In fact, I believe that the author hopes to point out the crisis of a part of the nation.</p>
<p>Today's China has already reached the edge of the misfortune of fifty years ago. Everyone must deeply consider and reflect on whether they have taken the wrong path? Has it exploited the name of "democracy" for their own benefit, thereby endangering the country and the nation? This book provides such a question:——"The road is to be walked by people, only that) way can be successful." So? Have you gone astray?</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Life Calendar of the Chinese People"</h3>
<p>— Pan Gen</p>
<p>(Compiled by Chen Guo and Qiu Peihao, published by Zheng Zhong Bookstore)</p>
<p>The Literature Records of the Han Book states: Before the Han Dynasty in our country, there were already six calendars of the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Xia, Yin, Zhou, and Xi. The origins of the calendar are ancient and important.</p>
<p>China is based on agriculture, and the chronology of the year is based on the order of autumn harvest and winter storage. The so-called "not missing the farming season" is the foundation of government and education. However, since the establishment of the autocratic regime, it has been the practice to determine the first month of the year, and therefore, the books recording the regulations and ordinances have flourished. The Book of Rites and the chapters on rites and music in the historical books of past dynasties belong to this category; since the theory of prophecies and weft books prevailed, they were used for divination and predicting good and bad fortune. Therefore, the theory of the ten celestial stems and twelve terrestrial branches and the five elements prevailed, and the divination works attributed to Dongfang Shuo and the books on astrology of later generations belong to this category. As for the customs of the common people, there are not many specialized works that can reveal the gains and losses of a generation's political affairs. If there are any, they originated from Customs and Throughs, and the Annual Records of Jingchu began to make records in the order of years and months. However, they are either limited to one time or only record one place, and are all records left over from the pens of literati, and works of leisure. Others are scattered throughout the books, and the authors are like Records of the Origins of Things, Records of Customs, Old Events in Wulin, and various local chronicles. Also, for example, the wrestling drama reached its peak in the Han Dynasty, and its system is briefly seen in the Biography of Li Si in the Records of the Grand Historian, the Annals of Emperor Wu of the Han Book, the annotations to the Two Capitals Rhapsody in the Selections of Refined Literature, and the Records of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang by Yang Xuanzhi. If it were not for extensive citations and quotations, its details would not be available. The matter of arranging and organizing these materials could not be accomplished overnight.</p>
<p>Now, reading "The Life Calendar of the Chinese People" co-authored by Mr. Chen and Mr. Qiu, even the slightest sigh or chant, if it is related to customs, is recorded without omission. The summary is concise and comprehensive, forming a great national work; and the use of ancient examples for the present is beneficial to politics and education. The culture of the ancient country of the East is clearly visible here. It is indeed appropriate to promote it overseas, with one copy for everyone. According to the authors' preface, this book took ten years to compile, and was revised many times. The depth of their intention and the diligence of their efforts can be seen.</p>
<h3>Making Cigarettes with Horse Manure</h3>
<p>— Ji Gan</p>
<p>Japan is truly a country that is good at making substitutes. Recently, due to the small number of cigarettes being rationed, some people have come up with a whimsical idea and invented a new product, the tobacco of which is made from horse manure that has been cut and pieced together using special methods. It is said that after analyzing this type of cigarette, its taste is not as pungent as expected. Therefore, buyers are rushing to buy it, and its sales are extremely wide, threatening ordinary cigarette merchants.</p>
<p>Using smelly horse manure to make cigarettes is really an irony in the eyes of us Chinese, who have always called them "fragrant cigarettes." However, due to the lack of supply, they can even put horse manure in their mouths and eat it in their stomachs. This shows the extent to which a person with a craving for cigarettes can eat anything to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>The Japanese are good at making substitutes. At the same time, Japanese goods, compared with the goods of other countries, are also a kind of substitute. We have called Japanese goods inferior goods in the past, and there is a reason for this. However, these inferior substitutes were once a threat to domestic goods and Western goods. The common people are not unpatriotic. The eight years of the War of Resistance are ironclad proof. However, when it comes to boycotting inferior goods, there is a bit of shame. The reason for this is the same as the Japanese's love of smoking cigarettes made from horse manure.</p>
<p>Among goods, there are substitutes. There are also substitutes for everything else, including people. When a student cannot rely on his usual hard work to cope with an exam, he uses cramming to replace it; if cramming is not enough to cope, honest people turn in blank papers, and dishonest people use cheating to replace it. When cheating becomes a last resort, it is really a dead end for that person. Furthermore, taking this cheating student as an example. He himself sometimes becomes a substitute in a class. When the number of people in a class who can pass the exam and advance or graduate is too small, the cheating students rise up to fill the quota and get by.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the appearance of substitutes is always due to the lack of supplies. After the appearance of substitutes, the original goods feel threatened. If we magnify the scope of substitutes tens of thousands of times, we can see how many substitutes are produced today and how great the threat felt by the original goods. We thoroughly hate the appearance of substitutes, but the solution to the problem still depends on the efforts of the original goods themselves.</p>

<h3>Ticket Refund Issues</h3>
<p>— Wu Derun</p>
<p>In the commercially prosperous Shanghai, if all daily transactions were conducted solely with cash, it would necessitate "requesting" the issuance of several more million-yuan and ten-million-yuan bills to ensure "ease of use." Therefore, currently, larger transactions are mostly settled with checks. For familiar clients and reputable businesses, a check is no different from cash, and it's even more convenient. However, when encountering a first-time transaction or when there's not complete trust in the other party, the recipient of the check feels uneasy. The reason for this unease, of course, is the worry about the check being returned.</p>
<p>The main reason for a returned check is, naturally, insufficient funds in the account, with the check amount exceeding the deposit. However, to protect the client's reputation, banks often conceal "insufficient funds" and falsely claim "uncleared funds" to deceive the "bearer." Some banks even use "please contact the drawer" or "please present again" as reasons for the return, which truly confuses the "bearer" and leaves them baffled. Therefore, I advocate that banks and money shops should not use vague terms when explaining the reason for a returned check but should provide a detailed explanation to the bearer. If the deposit is "sufficient" or "insufficient," they should state it directly, avoiding putting the bearer in a difficult position. (If the funds are not received and the check is returned to the drawer, then the reason for the return, "please present again," seems unreasonable.)</p>
<p>Especially in the current market situation, which changes rapidly, coupled with high interest rates on debts, if one sells goods and receives a bad check, the loss is significant. Moreover, if the check is endorsed or deposited into a money shop and then returned, it affects the person's reputation. Therefore, we believe that those who issue bad checks should bear unforgivable legal responsibility. Although current court rulings on lawsuits involving bad checks order repayment, these rulings seem lenient. Compensation should also be awarded for the mental distress suffered by the bearer. Not long ago, the "Silver Money Association" issued a notice to various money shops, stating that any client who issues a bad check more than three times will have their account closed and their checkbook confiscated. This is an excellent measure, and it is hoped that all banks will implement it to deter the misuse of checks and indirectly reduce many disputes in society, thereby maintaining financial integrity.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw and Vivien Leigh</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>Frank Harris wrote in his biography of George Bernard Shaw, "He (Shaw) said that when he had leisure, he would rewrite Hamlet one day, and he would write it in such a way as to reveal the true meaning of Hamlet."</p>
<p>From this statement, we can see Shaw's humor. Humor is not merely jesting; it contains a serious meaning. Shaw was radical in many aspects, from philosophy to politics, and his humor often tore away the outer garments of contradictions, exposing the truth nakedly.</p>
<p>Shaw differed from other thinkers; his followers were widespread across all social classes, but like Shakespeare, his works were read by a wide range of readers. Shaw was not just a thinker because, if he were only a thinker, he would not be able to deeply move the emotions of his readers. His play "Caesar and Cleopatra," which depicts the story between Cleopatra and Caesar, is one of his best historical comedies.</p>
<p>Shaw was born in Ireland on July 26, 1856, and is still alive today. His vegetarianism keeps him very healthy. During the filming of the movie, he often went to the studio to chat with Vivien Leigh, teaching her how to play the role, which shows how much Shaw valued this script.</p>
<h3>Love Songs of Tibetan Compatriots</h3>
<p>— Li Puyuan</p>
<p>The annual Sutra Display Ceremony at Kumbum Monastery is approaching. Tibetan, Hui, and Mongolian men and women are converging from all over the grasslands, mountains, tents, and earthen houses, like rivers flowing into the sea, at Lusar (Wenhua Town). Among them are chieftains, nobles, and ordinary people. Especially the women, each according to their own ethnic customs, wear their most gorgeous and beautiful clothes, bring their best ornaments, and their only silver coins, preparing to spend a dozen pleasant days here.</p>
<p>Almost ten days before the Sutra Display Ceremony, the small mountain opposite Wenhua Town, half of which is occupied by the temple, is covered with green grass, dotted with many scattered willows. White tents, like small piles of snow, are pitched up, some closer, some more distant. In front and behind them, women in bright red, green, and purple clothes, their braids, tassels, and ribbons swaying in the warm breeze, flutter around like the powdery wings of butterflies. The sun is bright, and the silver, jade, and coral ornaments in front and behind them sparkle like stars in the sunlight.</p>
<p>In any place nearby, anyone with a bottle of wine can gather a group of compatriots of both sexes within a few minutes. Immediately, a plaintive, soaring, and sharp song rises, swaying back and forth. People form a circle, one or two zhang in diameter, becoming thicker and thicker. In the middle are the love song singers, and around them are the audience. The love song singers are in pairs, some older, probably experienced singers, and some younger, said to be novices in the realm of love.</p>
<p>The melody of the love songs is generally the same, but the singers can express changes in emotion by stretching or raising certain sounds. What particularly reveals their poetic talent is that the lyrics of the love songs are improvised, instantly drawing from what the singer sees, hears, and thinks, without any hesitation. Moreover, the opponent sings first, and you have to continue from their lyrics, which is not easy. However, our seemingly rough and simple Tibetan compatriots can handle it fluently and naturally in nine out of ten cases!</p>
<p>The song is accompanied by dance, and there is absolutely no rigid or awkward love song singing. The rule is: the first person to sing, holding the wine bottle while singing and dancing, has the right to hand the bottle to the person they fancy at the end of a verse. The person who receives the bottle must immediately continue singing. If someone in the audience fancies the singer, they can immediately take over at the end of the last word of the song, and then the person being taken over must hand the bottle to you—often, because many people sing and harmonize well, they immediately run out of the circle together to enjoy their joyful fate, regardless of how many people are watching!</p>
<h3>Notes on Appreciating Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Listener</p>
<p>Kunqu opera originated with Wei Liangfu in the Ming Dynasty, flourished in the early Qing Dynasty, and declined after the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. The Shenbao newspaper is committed to promoting it, and on the evening of the fourth of this month, it was broadcast on the Oriental Radio Station. The first excerpt was "Demolishing the Book" from "Matching at the Western Tower," with Mr. Yin Zhenxian as Zhao Bojiang and Miss Liu Hutu as Yu Shuye. Mr. Yin comes from a Kunshan family and is a renowned doctor. His singing has always been praised by Mr. Yu Lianju (the father of Yu Zhenfei), known for his "jiao cu," "shi," and "jiao," and is called "Gu Qiao Yin" by opera aficionados. Miss Liu is his disciple, and her singing of the "Yi Lan Shan..." section of "Yi Jiang Feng" is accurate and relaxed. The "Hong Na Ao" section, "Kan Ta Can Lan Ying..." is extremely difficult to sing, reaching high into the clouds and low into the sea; without considerable skill, how dare one attempt it? Her dialogue is always consistent with the plot. The verbal sparring between Yu Shuye and Zhao Bojiang is exceptionally brilliant, the questions and answers are tight, and it's seamless, worthy of inheriting the mantle of Gu Qiao Yin. Particularly admirable is that the four tones are accurate, with proper intonation, just like her teacher. After "Demolishing the Book," Mr. Zhu Yaowen and Ms. Shen Zhuoru followed with the "Monopoly" from "Occupying the Flower Kui," both singing and dialogue were very skilled, another wonderful excerpt. Mr. Ye Xiaohong sang the "Xu Ge" from "The Palace of Eternal Life," the "Xi Qian Ying" scattered aria "Xiu De Ba..." seemed too short; the audience did not fully enjoy it. Mr. Ye is also an old opera singer, his temples are already frosted, yet he can still sing, truly commendable. Mr. Zhou Exuan sang the "Jing Bian" from "The Palace of Eternal Life," the "Shiliuhua" "Bu Lao Ni..." his voice is broad and grand, very fitting for the identity of the emperor, with unique subtleties and different from the ordinary. It is said that Mr. Zhou is also a top student of Yin's, most admirable. For future performances, if musical instruments such as sheng, pipes, and pipa could be added to coordinate with the dizi flute, it would be even more outstanding. With national music like this, why seek it in foreign lands?!</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Fire</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Miss A: I heard your brother was fired from the fire department.</p>
<p>Miss B: Yes—it's because of his poor eyesight.</p>
<p>Miss A: How so?</p>
<p>Miss B: He spent half the day spraying water from the hose, only to find out it wasn't a fire, but a red-haired foreign woman.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk While Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>"Why are people afraid of death?"</p>
<p>This seems like a simple and laughable question, however, upon careful thought, it is just like the question of why apples fall to the ground, and it is not unworthy of pondering by us, who pride ourselves as the beings of all creatures.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken or embellishing, it should be the view of a not very famous philosopher from Europe, who said:</p>
<p>"The reason why people cling to life and fear death is entirely the fault of the sun. The existence of the sun has an intangible power that awakens the will to live in living things, especially humans. Therefore, if the sun were to be destroyed and humans were still able to survive, humans, due to the loss of the will to live, would view life and death the same, and would regard death as an unremarkable path."</p>
<p>Therefore, from a historical or current worldview, excluding all kinds of violence and accidents, general deaths from illness mostly occur at night; when there is no sunlight.</p>
<p>And dying patients, knowing that their serious illness is difficult to cure, often ask those nearby, "What time is it?" or "Is it almost dawn?" From this tone, one can infer that the patient's subconscious seems to be saying that the patient hopes for dawn, hopes to see the sun of the next day. If they see the sun, it seems that they can get through the next day.</p>
<p>I have proposed such a deep question to my reader friends. If you are interested, I hope you can take a sip of strong tea, puff a faint smoke, and then think about it quietly.</p>
<p>Chang Zhi said it well:</p>
<p>Art must have a certain distance from real life.</p>
<p>Because this distance is precisely where the aesthetic realm lies. Like a doctor, no matter how compassionate he is, he must have apparent "cruelty" when performing surgery. His heart can be soft, but his hand must be hard.</p>
<p>Tai Sheng criticized my personality, saying, "You are the most passionate one, but you are also the most cruel one."</p>
<p>I frankly admitted his words. What should be added and explained is that when I cruelly handle a matter, I do not selfishly feel happy, I only feel boundless pain.</p>
<p>In life, for the sake of tomorrow, I also have times when I perform surgery on myself. Others observe me from the surface and feel that I am calm and indifferent to the point of being uncaring. However, my heart is trembling, a phenomenon that will never be noticed by the naked eye.</p>
<p>I have deeply understood what Dickens called the mystery between hearts.</p>
