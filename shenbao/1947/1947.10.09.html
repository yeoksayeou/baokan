<p>社論</p>
<h3>申論共產國際的再出現</h3>
<p>共產國際的再出現，本報旣於昨日着論有所論列：顧所論僅及於共產國際本身，及我們的如何自處之道。茲更願就國際政治方面，加以申論。</p>
<p>首先我們要指出的就是：此次共產國際的再出現，不能說是國際上的一種新壁壘。共產國際原是早已存在了的，它的出現在國際政治舞臺不自今日始；至於一九四三年五月的宣告解散，至多也只是對外取消了名義，論其實際，却依然存在如故，此本報於昨日社論中已經加以指出。共產國際自一九四三年五月以來，如果在法理上（do　juro）是散了的話，在事實上（do　facto）是存在着的。所以此次共產國隙地的再出現，決不是一種新壁壘的出現，而一種已經存在的老壁壘，重新掛上了旗號，準備宣戰。這也不能說是一種新共產國際，或第四國際；國爲在無論任何方面，這次出現的共產國際，實卽自一九一九年以來就已成立了的共產國際或第三國際的重新登台，在理論上，在本質上，不是一種新的組織。我們不能以爲有莫斯科的一紙通告解散，而認爲這是繼第一國際，第二國際，第二半國際，第三四際而成立的第四國際。這是我們應該認清的一點。</p>
<p>這次共產國際的再出現，有若干點值得我們的注意。第一，北歐諸國若分蘭那威等地的共產黨沒有參加；第二法義兩國亦列爲共產世界之內。關於第一點，北歐諸國共產黨的不參加，可以有兩方面的解釋：第一，蘇聯仍舊希望北歐諸國能够永久保守中立，不參加世界的鬥爭；第二，北歐諸國蘇聯已經認爲蘇聯的一部，所以各該地的共產黨可以無須參加這次共產國際的新宣言。在集權主義下，以企圖建立共產世界自任的蘇聯，是不容許有中立國家存在的：所以從其立國的本質上言，我們不相信此次共產國際的再出現而沒有北歐諸國的參加，是爲了要確保它們的中立。</p>
<p>講到法義，這無疑地是西方的民主與共產主義角逐之塲。蘇聯的鐵幕，已經自北海濱的史答丁延展到了亞德里海的特里斯特。在這綫以西的德國是在英法美諸國的占領下，所以義大利和法蘭西便變成了西方民主對共產主義在歐州的第一道防綫，當然克林姆宮是竭力想將它們奪取過來的。義法兩國的參加此次重新出現的共產國際，因之，便是一件極自然的事。由於此次義法兩國共產黨的參加，必然會有影響於此後兩國政治局勢的展開。義法兩國的共產黨在各該國內均有相當的實力，而法國的人民共和運動和義國的基督民主黨，他們亦擁有雄厚的實力。由於此次兩國共產黨的參加羅馬亞京城的宣言，可能使人民共和運動及基督民主黨的聲勢益爲增强。但法義值大戰之後，經濟瀕於破產，人民生計日蹙，如果西方民主的救援不及時趕到，前途亦難預測。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，我們看見英國政府的改組。這次艾德里政府改組，除了燃料及動力部長辛威爾免職外，並沒有多少使人值得注意的變動，工黨政府還依舊保持它的穩重的色調。原來英國的工黨本有左右兩翼，像貝文慕里遜等人，是擁有各地工會組織的實力而同時又是比較保守的人物：智職份子如衛生大臣皮帆卻比較近於急進。此次英政府的改組，貝文，慕里遜，克利浦斯等人，不但沒有動搖，反因而增强其地位。這也可以說是英國對此次共產國際的再出現的一種答復。英國雖然缺乏美元，國內的經濟局勢雖也十分艱難。然英國究不失爲西方民主的一大柱石。觀乎此次英政府的改組，益提高我們對於世界的信念。</p>
<p>目今的世界局勢旣這樣演變着，以「民主國家的兵工廠」自命的國家，自然更負起重大的責任。它應該有堅定的政策，及時以它的力量來支援它的興國，以力量來答復力量，以組織來答復組織。我們尤其不可忘了遠東，因爲在遠東我們看見有第二次世界大戰的爆發。只有這樣，我們纔能確保這一個民主世界，和世界和平！</p>

<h3>黨團圓重新總登記</h3>
<p>（上接一版）此次辦法乃係根據國民黨當前四中全會通過之「中國國民黨當前組織綱領」所擬訂者，該綱領指陳，爲整飭黨的紀律，決淘汰腐惡份子，嚴肅革命閉幕時宣稱：「此次黨團統一組織之後，第一步工作即爲舉辦黨員總登記，此次登記，務須將各地貪汚腐敗份子開除黨籍，不使其再混在本黨之內」，國民黨中央乃決定舉辦黨團圓重新總登記，藉以刷新黨的陣容，依照該項總登記辦法之規定，縣以上各級黨部，均負有主辦登記之責，凡領有黨證或臨入黨證明書之黨員，與領有團證或臨時入團證明書之團圓，除停止黨權或團權者外，均應依照限期，向所屬黨部申請登記，並填具登記表，申請登記之黨團員，如經審查有反言論或行爲，跨黨，在內造成或參加小組織，以破壞黨之統一，有貪汚行爲，參加總清查或總甄核未能合格等情形之一者，總認爲不合格。又黨團圓無論不參加登記或參加登記，經中央最後決定認爲不合格者，即喪其黨籍，至申請登記經審查合格之黨員，則由主辦登記之黨部編組造冊，重新宣誓，並逞呈中央頒發新黨證，其不合格者，則須呈送上級黨部覆審或彙呈中央決定。</p>
<h3>東北戰局　即可開朗　鄧文儀談現勢</h3>
<p>中央社南京八日電鄧局長文儀，於八日下午政院新聞局記者招待會中暢談東北報局現勢如下：</p>
<p>攻勢動機：自東北林彪匪部於七月間之第五次攻勢被粉碎於四平街主辦戰後，兩月來雖經積極補充，仍未達到足以再取攻勢之實力，然其最近所以突然發動者，其故有四：一爲呼應關內膠東之失敗，以遮掩國際觀聽；二爲乘此時機搶積糧食；三爲乘國軍將進攻華北之前，先發動東北之戰，以減輕對晋冀兩省之壓力；四爲在國軍大量增援補給尚未開赴東北以前，即作消耗戰之叛亂。</p>
<p>匪軍實力；東北共匪所盤據之地區，雖較國軍收復之積爲大，然皆人口稀少之處，徵補不易，其目前實力，除中共已正式編爲八個縱隊外（每縱隊約當一個軍），尚有韓共十四萬五千，蒙共三萬五千，日共一萬五千，合共實力四十四萬人，目前位置於中長路東者爲韓共，但尚未發動攻勢，其在遠西邊境已有行動者爲中共之第二七縱隊，其東爲一·三·四·六·縱隊，再加遼南營口之新八縱隊，及熱河錦西之八·九·縱隊，爲數已逾二十萬人。</p>
<p>目前行動：匪內鑒於國軍進攻山東及膠東半島戰略的澈底成功，切斷其關內外聯絡的生命綫，慘敗之餘，亦效法此項戰略，以首先破壞交通，切斷國軍補給綫，於九月下旬開始發動，先後在榆關錦州間攻擊，圖先破壞關內外鐵道交通，曾先在萬家屯·興城等處發動攻擊，以斷平滯鐵路、再向白旗堡·饒陽河·開原·昌圖等處，直向鐵道綫發動攻勢，而不知國軍關內外之聯絡，陸上固不僅北寗，中長鐵路，而空中與海上之補給更非匪在關內之膠東半島與關外之遼東半島可以比擬；其次則在使中長路綫上如長春·四平街·開原·鐵嶺·瀋陽·遼陽·鞍山·皆陷孤立，故在鐵路以西之二·七·縱隊，向法庫昌圖進攻，以一·二·六·縱隊主力向西豐·八面城·開原進攻，六縱隊更折向長春東南竄擾，四縱隊向鐵嶺以東攻擾，八縱隊則由遼南發動，一方面破壞交通，一方則圖打擊軍野戰軍實力，國軍對於此種蠢動已有預定計劃，刻下部署已定，詎之攻勢業已受頓挫，國軍正在各方面對匪迎頭痛擊中。</p>
<p>今後前途：以今日匪在東北之背景及之狀況言之央此雙方尚未作主力決戰以前之態勢，戰避正在發展，判斷變方之勝負尚覺過早，但以國軍今日爲國家收復領土，爲民族保持生存之士氣言之，匪雖恃有不斷之後援，且吾人亦不能低估其實力，但其已失去東北人民之同情，加之國軍士氣旺盛，保土衛民之決心與信心十分堅强，則東北戰局前途不久必可望其開動。</p>
<h3>關內匪軍動態分析</h3>
<p>最近一週關內匪軍動態之分析：</p>
<p>陳毅匪部之行動可分作膠東，魯西，蘇北，及豫皖蘇邊區四地區分別說明：膠東匪軍之九，十三，兩縱隊，因國軍克烟台，牟平後，直趨文登，威海衛，有被殲于海邊之極大危險，故其九縱隊及十三縱隊小部西竄逃生，企圖在濰河高密間，與被逼困于諸城西北北二·七·縱隊殘部合流，其第十三縱隊殘匪，則已退在威海衛以南地區，現我海軍與陸軍配合，已進入威海衛及榮城灣，匪如負嵎困鬥，可能被我完全殲匪，原由地方部隊凑合編成，戰鬥力極弱，蠶伏夜動，不過徒作牽制國軍，及保黃河南北之連繫而已。蘇北匪軍本無多大兵力，每乘國軍調動之際，乘空偷襲城鎭，打家刦舍，以爲掠取物資，征補兵員之消極行動。豫皖蘇邊區之匪軍，乃陳毅匪部在魯西潰敗後主力，該匪原關東越鐵路，竄入兩淮，但以萬餘之眾，圍　攻國軍僅一個大隊固守之宿縣，經二日以上之時間，仍被擊退，可知其戰鬥力量自魯西鉅野，城武，曹縣各戰役後，已大削减，不能與國軍作主力之戰鬥，同時見到宿遷瞧寗方面已有强大之國軍兵力向南壓迫，如東越鐵路，必被逼于雙溝，睢寧，淮河地區，拘束於兩面湖沼兩面國軍之間，實爲極大危險，所以忍痛放棄此最好策略，而將三，四，六，縱隊殘部自蒙城，渦陽西竄，一，八，十二，縱隊殘部向扶溝以南流竄者，乃求避免爲國軍之圍殲，減輕劉伯承部之困難而欲合流也，然此企圖至今仍未完全實現。</p>
<p>至劉匪伯承部，上週來被國軍將其一，二，六縱隊殘部圍擊於白雀園附近，連日苦戰，死傷約六七千人，方於本月三日突圍向東南逃竄，實狼狽不堪，最近已被迫向黃安麻城間倉卒潰敗，所餘無多，其第三縱隊殘部，原盤踞固始三河夾一帶者，以經商城之慘敗後，故向立煌逃竄，再　進入大別山，然因國軍已先將山城控制，故匪欲重建山區根據地之夢想，一時無由實現，况自國軍以優厚兵力從光山，潢川，商城方面施行陋離戰術後，劉匪之一，二，六，縱隊旣不能向東北與其第三縱隊殘部會合，更無法與陳毅匪部呼應作戰，其企圖勢難達成。</p>
<p>陳賡匪部之范其華部，因國軍自潼關東進，及出　南商城以有力之部隊向其壓迫，進入伏牛山地，出於被動並非預定之步驟行動。至於韓適匪部之四·九·縱隊，連日被國軍攻擊於洛寗東北之韓城鎭附近，傷亡已六七千，退亦不能，進無可望，困難之極，只得將已竄至伊陽以東之匪廿六旅調回營救，現經國軍阻擊於鳴畢鎭之主力戰爭，可爲該匪潰奔之開始序幕。</p>

<h3>論當前戡亂軍事形態</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　劉光炎</p>
<p>剿匪軍事。最近積極開展。以國軍將士的用命，山東共匪，已將肅清；爲國軍收復。此在戡亂軍事上，誠爲一大成就，其意義的重要，比延安，張家口的收復，尤有過之。但共匪受此重創後，遂改採流竄政策，四出騷擾；值此秋收季節，不惟物資上遭其刦奪，人民尤備受殺戮鬥爭之慘。少數不明眞相的人，看見共匪在短期內流竄地域，如此廣袤，或輕信共匪自製的流言，以爲實力或相當極大。本文將就實際情勢與共匪企圖，略加論述，以就正於關心當前時局的讀者。</p>
<p>第一，我們試檢討當前軍事形勢：最近共匪蠢動值得吾人注視的，計分下列數點：　爲陳賡部隊的盤據伏牛山脈，有西進或南下企圖。　爲山東餘匪未清，尤以渤海濱三角地帶的殘匪，尚重整旗鼓。　爲陳毅匪部的南竄，有與劉伯誠合流之勢。　爲劉伯誠匪部大肆裹脅，似有不逞圖謀。這些都是關心戡亂軍事情勢的人所注意的事。不過我們倘一覆按實際情形，便知共匪的種種動作，不外故作姿態，用壯聲勢的成份居多。例如陳賡匪部到現在還潛伏在伏牛山脈，證明他們不敢遠離黃河綫。他們雖然裁斷了隴海綫，但隨時在貴防國軍的包圍。他們如果向西或南深入，一有緊急事態，便無法回竄，以致重蹈李先念的覆轍。又如山東渤海區三角地帶，雖然殘其尚在裝腔作勢，但其在殘存的某縱隊，均係民兵編成，並無多大戰鬥力。山東其他方面之匪，現方作强攻濰縣姿態；但明瞭匪情的人，都知道他們是夢想回到沂蒙山區。不要說國軍隨時監視，絕不令其得逞，且沂蒙山區匪豫儲的食糧，全爲國軍掌握，匪即入山區，亦無復覓食。至於烟台威海衛先後軍收復後，共匪雖誇稱尚有黃河口岸，可供其南北交通；惟在黃河北岸各港口，雖間看能爲匪利用的，但規模狹小，僅能容小帆船，以視烟台，威海衛的可以容納艟　巨艦，其價值相差，自不可以道里計。復次，爲陳毅之南竄。外傳陳毅匪部，已與劉伯誠匪部合流；惟實有若干距離。且劉匪與陳匪之戰略作風，迥不相同，吾人雖無法詳細臚陳，惟即此可以指出陳劉兩匪部合流之非易。最後爲劉伯誠部。劉匪爲最早南竄的匪部，曾因此引起後方人心的恐慌；惟劉匪部眾，奔馳數月，已出八萬人减至二萬餘人，且因日行百餘里，體力不支，官兵待遇又大相懸殊，致士氣非常頹喪。最近劉匪僅以經扶縣作中心，向四外騷擾，無甚重大企圖。或謂劉匪將竄入大別山脈作根據地，此或有可能；惟國軍已早燭其奸，必能堵剿。</p>
<p>第二，我們再看共非常此種竄犯政策的企圖：——爲明晰起見，可以分下列數點來說明：　共匪目的在製造難民。共匪爲增加我政府困難，早已決定大批製造難民，七月華北滄縣一帶共匪蠢動時，即以此爲口號。此次劉伯誠部所到之處，搶刦一空，並將房舍燒光，人民迫走，其爲製造難民政策的賡續，毫無疑義。　共匪目的在製造後方騷亂暴動，以阻撓我軍事的進行。共匪在軍事上受我重擊後，知其力萬不足與我抗爭，乃轉而向我後方各都市，作煽動暴動的工作。爲準備實行此工作，必先搖動人心；而在今日搖動人心的方法，莫如破壞建設，阻得交通，造成經濟恐慌。共匪本此策略，故劉伯誠所到之處，盡　從破壞工廠·礦塲，與裁斷鐵路着手，近月物價的飛漲，實直接受其影響。　共匪陳賡劉伯誠等部之渡河南竄或東犯，其初意均在聲援陳毅部隊，保持山東軍區地盤，尤其是渤海區三角地帶的補給生命站。但此一計劃，今已成爲泡影，故彼等不惜四散竄犯，一以洩其被痛擊之忿，一以藉此另關生機，所謂「無辦法中的辦法」是。</p>
<p>我們縱覽全局，感覺到當前戡亂軍事是可以樂觀的。自關內而論，可說剿匪軍事的第一期工作，已經完成了。至於今後要務，除了軍事上緊緊追擊，不令死灰復燃外，其重點還應放在政治和經濟上面。只要政府能整肅吏治，加强基層政治，共匪絕不能再如前的四出竄擾。只要政府在經濟上加速生產，節省經費，使一般人民的生活，逐漸改善，共匪雖以武力裹脅，亦必爲民眾所共棄。</p>
<p>以上是就關內一般態勢而言。至於東北戰局，共匪這次集結了較前更大的兵力，向國軍攻犯，其勢若甚汹汹。但國軍在瀋陽已集結有强大主力部隊；且增援補給，尤較以往數次有更完善的佈置，即以士兵禦寒配備而論，國軍的情形遠勝匪部，因此，東北共匪此次繼鬥時間，雖或較以往數次爲長，而其最後終必潰退，仍無可疑</p>
<p>綜括起來說，全面剿匪軍事，是可以樂觀的。現下所宣致力的，在政府方面：是如何整肅吏治的，平抑物價，同時加强總動員，發動大批基層幹部，開往前方，使一切與軍事可以配合。在人民方面是：如何貢獻其力量與物資，以助成戡亂建國的大業。（十月七日）</p>

<h3>希臘問題美蘇絕南協調　聯大會圖窮匕見　政委會辯論臨最後階段　波蘭主張直截討論巴勒斯坦分治</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞紐約八廣廣播：成功湖訊，波蘭代表今日敦促聯合國大會放棄有關解決巴勒斯坦問題之其他一切建議，而集中全部力量於分割地，俾成立猶太國及阿拉伯國。波代表並主張允許歐洲流亡猶太人民廿五萬人，移入巴勒斯坦。按此項辦法係爲阿拉伯各國所竭力反對者。</p>
<p>﹝本報訊〕紐約八日廣播：成功湖訊，波代表今日在聯大之演說，初次顯示蘇聯集團有拒絕阿拉伯要求，而贊成聖地分治之可能。波代表謂，鑒於阿族與猶族之無法合作，分治殆爲唯一解決辦法，雖則此項辦法並非波蘭最初願加贊同者。但彼蘭仍希望聖地在經濟上仍能自成一單位，分治各國應力謀合作云。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社成功湖八日電〕聯合國大會五十七國政治委員會，今日辯論巴爾幹問題，造成聯合國機構有史以來之極度混亂狀態後，美蘇兩國對於巴爾幹爭執所提解決方案間，顯已失去折衷可能，攤牌之期日益迫近。一部份代表認爲政治委員會將於週末以前付請表決，立即提交大會討論。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社成功湖八日電﹞聯合國大會經三週之雄辯攻訐後，八日業已到達最高潮，蓋希臘及巴勒斯坦兩大議案，終於圖窮七現突。預計關於巴勒斯坦，蘇聯集團本日在委員會中將拒絕阿拉伯方面管制巴勒斯坦之要求，而支持分聖地成猶阿兩邦之一般原則。望眼欲穿之美國對希政策宣言，可能在九日或十日披露。普遍辯論業已結束，而政委會亦開始審査半打或半打以上之提案。最後一分鐘內，小國及美蘇中途之國家，反對蘇美決戰，可能使美國要求大會譴責南保阿三國侵略而將希臘局勢歸咎三國之努力，全功盡棄。</p>
<p>﹝路透社成功湖八日電〕聯大政委會昨辯論希臘問題時，南斯拉夫代表貝勃勒指英國在希臘不顧盟國協定，立即引起英代表麥克尼爾之反駁，責其不應使用侮辱言辭，並曰，「相信其神經病平復以後，必將道歡。」瑞典代表翁登提出折衷案，不擬歸咎任何人，並要求希臘與其鄰邦恢復正常關係。希代表梅拉斯否認希臘正在備戰，渠要求聯合國保護希臘，辯論旋即改期。</p>
<h3>安理會續辯印尼問題　荷代表四面楚歌　蔣延黻駁克里芬斯演說</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖七日電〕聯合國安全理事會七日恢復辯論印尼問題時，荷代表克里芬斯陳辭，曾引起若干國包括中國之嚴辭駁斥。中國代表蔣廷黻領導對荷代表之攻勢，略謂：克里芬斯發言太多，反而削弱其立塲。</p>
<p>渠述及種種暴行，然又一躍而進入其結論，謂整個印尼政權均應在譴責之列，須知共和國領袖對於暴行所感之遺憾，殊不亞於我人。吾人在法律上雖得責成印尼領袖負責，但其間究有區別，不可一概而論。近來外界謠傳荷蘭有不復承認印尼目前領袖之意此舉將爲繼續印尼抵抗之有力動機。蔣氏　即請安理會充分支持三國調處委員會，並責成該會立即開始工作。</p>
<p>印波二國代表支持蘇聯建議</p>
<p>印尼代表畢萊促安理會速令雙方撤返衝突發生前之位置。畢萊復譴責荷代表發言時之語氣及實質，認渠尙未充分注意和平解決之必要條件。渠指出荷代表未能說明其政府準備如何執行停戰令，殊令人失望。波代表卡卓基支持蘇聯之逮議，請安理會令雙方撤返衝突前之防綫，渠並指出安理會之主要失敗，在不能以平等待遇給予雙方。</p>
<p>印尼代表要求迅採有效行動</p>
<p>印尼代表巴拉，謂荷軍停止推進時，即立即劃出假想的界綫，對於不幸落於該界綫後之城鎭村落，開始軍事行動，故荷軍之未在字義上及精神上尊重停戰令，已至爲明顯。巴氏前後提出下列諸點：　印尼歡迎三國調處委員會，　印尼希望聯合國能保證其解決辦法對雙方均有拘束力，　印尼要求採取迅速行動，防止破壞及死亡；　三國委員會應在荷蘭及印尼區外工作，以防受直接影響。</p>
<p>美國料將反對雙方撤兵主張</p>
<p>﹝合衆社成功湖七日電﹞據悉，蘇要求在三國委員會以「斡旋」方式開始解決印荷糾紛前，荷軍應撒退至七月二十日之地區，美國將在安理會反對比一建議。據悉：美國擬建議三國委員會立即協助印荷雙方，冀能由此獲得解決糾紛方法。</p>
<h3>被俘荷兵業經釋放</h3>
<p>﹝路透社巴達維亞七日電﹞荷兵三名，前因所乘美機被迫降落爲印尼軍所俘，茲巳經日惹下令釋放，搭美機飛返荷蘭控制區。</p>
<h3>西南非託管問題我支持印度建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕印度與南非關於西南非洲難題之爭執，在聯合國托管委會七日會議中發生激辯，中國表示支持印度之立塲。印度上週之建議今日在託管會中討論，印度主張由聯大決定限期，令南非提出將西南非託管之建議。南非駁稱，南非無「將代管地置於託管制下之法律義務」，荷蘭支持南非。丹麥提出建議，支持南非而另主設立一調査事實團體。中國代表劉錯乃大舉反對丹麥建議稱，如丹麥建議能獲通過，一則此團體所得之消息，與聯合國之計劃有何關聯？」此團體將一無成就，「惟可以以掩蔽託管西南非洲一事毫無決定而已，且可迴避本題而造成破壞憲章之局面。」</p>
<h3>回教靑年　枕戈待命　顧爲巴勒斯坦奮鬥</h3>
<p>﹝路透社開羅七日電﹞回教兄弟會會長班加致電阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆，吿以回教靑年一萬名，已枕戈待命，準備爲巴勒斯坦奮鬥。並曰此乃回教軍之第一師，渠認戰鬥乃唯一救護巴勒斯坦之方法。</p>
<h3>美對朝鮮問題新建議　明日可提交聯大　霍奇勸韓人持冷靜態度</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社成功湖七日電﹞頃據權威人士稱，美國希望於九日（星期五）向聯合國政委會提出其對朝鮮問題之動議，美國在動議中主張設立聯合國委員會，以監視韓國選舉及美蘇軍隊之撤退。美國將歡迎蘇聯所提兩國同時撤軍之建議，惟將建議聯合國稱，尙有甚多問題最好由聯合國委會處理，美國將建議在此委會中，美蘇均不得有代表參加。</p>
<p>前時一般討論美國將建議盟國經濟援韓，惟美國在動議巾將不提此一點，而建議應韓國要求設立一機構，與調査撤軍之組織合作。美國最高級人士堅決否認美擬建議聯合國托管韓國之謠傳，彼等稱，此說與美代表團此時之意見南轅北轍。美代表團七日集會，馬歇爾親自出席，當即決定儘早提出美國之建議。</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城八日電﹞霍奇將軍今日發表聲明稱，關於朝鮮問題，因美蘇混合委會之擱淺，而由美國提付聯大討論，朝鮮人士要求派遣代表參與聯合國會議事。美方事前並無所悉，美方更無指派某人充任朝鮮代表之事，本人亦無權選朝鮮之代表。關於朝鮮大選事，因聯合國現正待討論朝鮮問題，而其結果如何，尙未可預料，現在舉行大選，將召致更多困難。朝鮮人士如支持聯合國解決朝鮮問題，則應更力持冷靜忍耐，以企問題之順利解決。</p>
<h3>洗刷好戰罪名美獲初步勝利</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電﹞美國反對蘇聯指美國戰爭販子之控訴一事，七日在聯合國中獲初步勝利，羅斯福夫人在社會委會中指揮作戰，委會卒以卅四對六票，否決蘇聯限制報紙自由以阻遏戰爭販子之提案，八國棄權。</p>
<h3>美記者檢討蘇聯新政策</h3>
<p>﹝中央社紐約七日電﹞共產國際刻已成立，克里姆林宮究將如何完成其新政策？據紐約時報政治記者塞咨柏基稱：莫斯科各領袖，諒將在各種過程中採取下列戰略：　與羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，匈牙利，及阿爾巴尼亞簽訂雙邊軍事聯盟，同時規定軍事配備及技術之標準化。按蘇聯已與波蘭，捷克及南斯拉夫簽訂此項協定。　若共產黨在希臘，奧地利，義大利獲得控制權，則蘇聯即與各該國或叛徒立同樣協定。　繼續宣傳，同時可能予希臘叛徒以其他支持。　促使法義出現最有力之共黨機構。　拖延對德對奧之和約談判僵局。關於蘇聯於歐洲以外之活動，塞氏復作下列觀察：蘇聯在中東之宣傳，將予加强，然成就將各有不同。蘇聯將在朝鮮維持其居美國上風之地位；在外蒙，蘇聯之勢力，已高於一切。塞氏曾在一九四一年因報導蘇德戰事成績優良而獲美國駐外記者協會之獎金。塞氏稱，僉信莫斯科不僅注意外　之錫及金，同時亦注意可通往印度之通道讓與權基地（如中蘇共同控制新疆時所獲得然）。塞氏稱，蘇聯此舉之理由之一，爲共黨深信非共黨國家，將於數年內陷入危險之蕭條期；其他一項理由，則爲共黨之正統敎條，即資本主義與共產主義問之戰爭，乃不可避免者。</p>
<h3>澳外長謁社魯門　主張從速召開對日和會　並透露遠東委員會已擬定原則</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓七日電﹞澳洲外長伊伐特本日與杜魯門總統會議時，强調對日和約之緊急需要。伊氏與總統會談半小時後稱：澳洲歡迎美國召開和會之建議。渠說明：列强對於遠東會議之初步行動，已有一致之同意，但渠拒不預測會議將於何時舉行。渠稱：渠近曾在日遊歷，發見麥帥對佔領事宜，「處理極佳」。渠透露：遠東委員會已擬定解決遠東問題之原則，並評稱：此種解決應較爲國問題之解決，更爲簡單。或問新歐洲共產國際對於遠東有何可能之影響，渠對此拒不答覆，但稱此種新組織之宣佈「僅爲一種徵象」。</p>
<h3>處置義屬領會議　中國等十九國獲發言權</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕四强外長代表今日議決准許中國等十九國，就義大利前殖民地問題提出意見，此皆簽字於對義和約之國，如和約簽字後成立之巴基斯坦及對義前殖民地有土地要求之埃及及義大利。惟前述各關係國家對於前往義前屬領實地調查民意之四强調查委員團所採之程序，是否亦得表示意見，則尙未經四强成立協議。據倫敦義大使館發言人今日透露，義政府不久將向四强會議提出備忘錄，陳述義大之態度，並將强調政治上及經濟上之原因，以要求准許義國參加其前菲洲屬領之行政。若義國得在聯合國託管下治理其前殖民地，則匪特可以滿足義政府之志願，且能極有助於解決地蠶萬義大利勞工之失業問題。</p>
<h3>新共產國際成立後　法義共黨處境困難　美國務院肅淸不穩份子</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社巴黎七日電〕此間一般相信，新共產國際成立後，法義共黨處境大爲不利。在鐵幕外，僅法義共黨參加此一組織，此舉明示法義政府將爲新共產國際之第一個靶子。而共黨亦顯已自毀前程，以後將無法參加法義政府，組織聯合內閣。按權取主要閣席，素爲共產黨「合法」奪取政權之方式</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬七日電﹞義共黨領袖朗哥稱：共黨戰綫之組織，係表示戰爭危險之尖銳與迫近，情報局組織會議祗限於南。保。匈。波。法。捷。羅。義。及蘇聯，因此數國現最受採取侵略行動之帝國主義之成脅，而亦因此等國家，最能抵抗其進攻。</p>

<p>﹝路透社東京八日電﹞美軍星條報稱：日共黨第二巨頭野崎否認日本共黨與新共產國際有關。渠稱此乃歐洲問題，與日本共黨無關，日本共黨他日亦不致與其有聯絡。野崎表示：日本共黨於獲得更準確之情報後，將發表正式意見。</p>

<h3>加緊！加緊！　遏制市塲漲風　市長報吿原因與對策　大批經濟警察今出動　對自備外匯進口貨有建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來本市物價又起漲風，金鈔·棉紗·美匯黑市更形猖獗，市府於昨日上午十一時舉行經濟檢査會報，商討對策。下午四時三刻，吳市長在市府會議室接見各報記者，報吿議決辦法如下：（一）金鈔：爲確切　滅黑市價格，除加緊檢査及稽核外，決嚴格檢査香港至上海之無綫電報，並嚴禁私設電台，以免其影響黑市波動。至於外匯黑市高漲原因，係由於市上謠傳中央將准許開放自備外匯購貨，市民信以爲眞，羣相吸收所致。現市府決向巾央建議兩點：　已進口而無許可證之貨物，非屬必需品者，決令其退歸原地，惟嚴禁運往香港，以防其走私來滬。　已進口無許可證之貨物，凡屬工業必需用品者，決由政府統　分配於各工廠，中問商人規定其合法利潤。上項辦法，市長曾分向行政院張院長及中央銀行張總裁商洽，深信中央極有採納可能。（二）棉價：金鈔美匯價波動，實由於棉紗漲風而起，故市府決心抑平，已令警察局及紡調會澈査各廠存紗之來蹤去跡，以取締踢皮球性質之交易，一經査獲決嚴辦。（三）食米：加配於本市工人及貧民之食米現已實行。市府近又向中央請求加配　米，最近即可運滬。又為疏通本市食米來源起見，已呈請中央令糧食部轉飭各產米區將食米儘量運滬，則食米價格必可穩定。（四）食油：目前本市食油仍有黑市及走私情形，現市府已常請行政院轉令溫州寗波兩地海關，禁止食油轉口南運。吳市長末稱：九日起將出動大批經濟警察，對於檢査會報所決議各點，切實執行。</p>

<h3>審核假釋手續複雜　上海監獄解釋　稽遲實現原由</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「假釋」，「假釋」，多少漢奸家屬盼望「假釋」的實現。蘇州監獄已經假釋了十三人，第二批又審定四十九人，爲什麼上海監獄遲遲不予實行呢？爲了求得這一問題的答案，記者昨訪上海監獄當局，據吿稱：蘇州監獄因審奸工作較早，故假釋亦較早，上海監獄，對假釋工作，刻正積極進行，日內即可將名册及考核表送請司法行政部核閱，假釋手續頗爲複雜，外界不明眞相，致起誤會。</p>
<p>在獄漢奸須合乎下列條件，始得假釋：　受徒刑之執行，　有悛悔實據，　無期徒刑逾十年後，有期徒刑逾二分之一後，所謂無期徒刑及有期徒刑均指執行刑而言，即以實際在監獄受刑之執行日數爲限，覉押日數不予通算，因此，符合假釋條件的漢奸幷不多。至於査有悛悔實據，係經該獄敎化課，作業課，警衛課的考核，其考核犯人標準依：　作業，　責任觀念及意志，　操行三項，分數共分四級，合格者即升一級，按照監獄條例第七十五條，第七十六條之規定，升至第一，二級時即有假釋希望，提出該獄累進處遇審査會審核合格，再經獄務委員會通過，由典獄長逕呈司法行政部核准，假釋工作方吿完成。假釋出獄者，須依刑法第九十四條付保護管束，以防其故態復萌，假釋之目的，在使人改過自新，如於假釋期間犯罪判刑者，撤銷其假釋其出獄日數不算入刑期內。</p>

<h3>紹興人的光榮！　標準下江人在重慶</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶六日航訊﹞下江人初來重慶這個水陸碼頭，少有人不知道　洪福的。這位四十七歲的中年人，民國二十六年八月一日踏進川境，短短的十年間，他已成爲重慶頗佔重要地位的「聞人」之一了。</p>
<p>鄭洪福十三歲時便在慈谿「回春堂」國藥號常學徒，十九歲到上海，任河南路「蔡同德」藥號爲小先生。</p>
<p>一個偶然的機會，使他在二十三歲跑進「一品香」當司賬。他的一位合川朋友余紹樵先生，請他來四川稅局帮忙，結果，他在林森路九道門附近，化了五百七十元頂下一座舖面，</p>
<p>洪福餐館就此開幕。據說：潘公展先生當時由九道門海外部，社會部外出，就常喜歡在洪福餐館吃一碗排骨麵的。</p>
<p>他感覺殺生總不是件好事。終久又恢復了他的本行，請了二十位朋友湊資，每人五萬元，合股一百萬，就將洪福餐館改建成重慶浙江慶餘堂藥號。開幕的第一日，重慶各報上刋登慶餘堂巨幅廣吿：「優待抗戰軍人家屬，一律送診送藥，不取分文，直至抗戰勝利爲止」。一直到今日，「慶餘堂」仍是贈醫贈藥，而且還可以由病者指定他所相信的那位中醫爲他義診。三十四年十月七日，重慶市</p>
<p>抗戰軍人家屬，假新運會禮堂舉行向將主席等獻旗典禮，征屬代表周敬修特獻鄭洪福單條一幅，因爲他「樂善好施，惠及征屬甚多」。而「兵役部奏次長德純並特別指出浙江慶餘堂經理鄭洪福先生，八年來捐助征屬這醫藥費達千餘萬，可欽可敬」。（據三十四年十月七日新蜀報紀載）</p>
<p>曾經有過一個時期，他自己經辦的直屬工廠（包括煉油廠，紙烟廠）和商店有十個單位。而由他負責管理的却不下二。三十個。這位</p>
<p>白手起家的誠樸商人，有他一番高尙理想：「取之於社會，用之於社會」。他認爲：如果他辦的一所工廠可以安定五百個員工生活，十個工廠不正養活了五千個？這五千位，至少又能維持萬餘個家族。設若社會上每一個構成份子，都可以參加生產事業，市容一定更繁榮，社會一定更安定。</p>
<p>他有一百多張聘書，記者每一張都仔細觀閱，可以說，</p>
<p>全是義務一無權力。例如：養民還鄕協助會財務委員，世界紅卍字會重慶分會理事長，中華理敎總會重慶分會理事長，他連死人的事情都操心，還是已故同鄉遷運委會的主任委員。記者極坦白的向鄭洪福說道：</p>

<h3>宋子文在廣東　肩挑三千五百萬子民</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州四日航訊〕南海金風，姍姍遲來，五羊城裏一片熱浪，一直　到人們的心頭。</p>
<p>宋主席就職了，三日晨十時正，在莊嚴的中山紀念堂裏一陣悠揚的軍樂聲中，宋主席在羅卓英將軍的手裏，接過了這末一個「斗大金印」。「光明而來，光明而去」的羅前主席致詞中，語重心長，有云：「今日的交接典禮，不只是印信公文的交代，而且要把全省五萬多的公務員誠心交代新人，不只是把五萬多忠誠服務的公務員交代新人，更重要的是把三千五百萬兄弟姐妹，交代新人」。怎樣呢？這位別離鄉井二十年的政治風雲人物，禮堂上燈光映照着半頭白髮，用一口上海話誦讀着簡短的演詞。他許下了兩個心顧：欲蓋是「願不久的將來，廣東的百姓都能够安居樂業，」一個是「省府人事無大更動，望全體同人安心工作。」短短十二分鐘的報告，彷彿已經把謎揭開一半，把人心安定了一半，尤其是一面笑容裏夾着不絕於耳的「兄弟兄弟」，聽起來使人感覺到有點「不尋常」。</p>
<p>宋主席有的是計劃，有的是聲望，更有的是錢，掛在宋院長心裏的也是「廣東的經濟危機」，「四美　，二難幷」廣東三千五百萬民衆總應該有機會伸一口氣。秋深了，大家都在想：會不會有一個秋天裏的春天？（記者梁小中）</p>

<h3>監院　報吿書　全文　（續乍）</h3>
<p>戊，外商近來均宣傳我政府之貿易政策，對其有所歧視壓迫，在事實上加以考察，適得其反。就汽車，煤油，烟葉，車糖，電影片等五項限額分配言：去年冬季爲進口最多者汽車限額分配爲四十五家汽車商號，共輸入爲一，二五一輛，總値美金一，八〇六，九二四，〇〇元，美商福特汽車公司佔三八二輛，値美金五〇〇，九八四。〇〇元，美商聯喊汽車行佔一五〇輛，値美金一九五，九三四。〇〇元，馬迪汽車公司佔八十八輛，値美金一三三，八二七。〇〇元，三家即佔全額半數，合計其他外商分配之汽車，佔全部配額三分之二以上。就媒油限額分配言：去年冬季二十二家商號，共計分配油二三二，〇三八，六一四升，總値美金六，九〇七，九〇一。〇〇元，計亞細亞火油公司佔四八，三〇七，二五〇公升，値二，三八七，六八二。〇〇美元，美孚火油公司佔四一，五四四，一六〇公升，値二，〇三三，五四〇。〇〇美元，德士古火油公司佔二三，五六一，二五七公升，値一，〇〇三，六六二。〇〇美元，三家即佔全額百分之九十以上。以電影片限額分配論：去冬全部入口之電影片八〇八，八九九公尺，總値九六，〇五六。〇〇美元，全部均屬外商，其餘烟葉與重糖兩項之情形，亦復如是。（見附件十八）。此外，其他各項限額與非限額商品輸入，均依一定之標準，明文規定，事實昭然，中外商人均受同等待遇，更不致有若何歧視情事之發生也。（詳附件十九。）</p>
<p>已，査自去年十一月十七日以後，凡進口貨品雖採取事前審核許可入口，交由輸入臨時管理委負會負責，然行政院對於若干物品之入口，可直接發給核准輸入許可書，通知輸入臨時管理委員會發給人口許可證，其特准入口物資一部份固以國防上之必要而不能不採取特殊辦法，然觀本年十一月十七日至本年五月底之表列物品，（詳附件二十）大都與一般入口物品無別，且其中特准汽車入口一項，復有種種與法令抵觸之處，不惟有損政府立法與執法之威信，且啓私人營求分外利益之機會，今後行政院對於特許入口物資之核准，似宜格外鄭重。</p>
<p>庚，我國過去政府之最高經濟決策機關，其參加人選往往或有經營工商企業人士參加，或以參加經濟決策機構，乃假其特殊便利，而經營工商企業，結果巧取豪奪，形成鉅富，故國內人士有目爲官僚資本者，有喩爲豪門資本者，全國輿論均以應加取締根除，最近政府當局亦迭次明令，禁止官吏經營商業，査中央最近成立之經濟委員會，其參加委員人選，仍不免有少數直接經營工商企業者，此等人士在事務實施之技術上言；固能於該會以若千便利，然以其決策之機密性言：實大有妨碍，如最近該會決定外匯官價政策之變更，滬、上盛傳有若干人士，因消息之靈便，而事先收購美金短期庫劵，以獲取鉅利者，雖未得實據，然人言可畏，於政府信譽有關，似宜對於該會委員人選，有重新愼重選擇之必要也。</p>
<p>辛，查孚中公司之資本，完全由交通銀行，金城銀行，中國國貨銀行之投資組成，不惟其營業性質非爲生產建設事宜，且有利用其紐約分公司之名義，以逃避稅捐，隱藏利潤之嫌疑，已如前述。又查交通銀行章程第十八條規定：「交通銀行除第十七條所列各項營業外，不得經營左列各項及其他事業，」其第四項規定，不得「直接經營各種工商專業」，（見附件廿一）又三十五年三月行政院第七三六次會議，修正通過之財政都管理銀行辦法，第十一條規定：「銀行不得爲商店或他銀行他公司之股東，但經財政部之核准，投資於生產建設事業者，不在此限」，第十二條規定「銀行不得直接經營工商事業……」交通，金城，中國國貨三銀行，合資組織孚中公司一舉，顯係違反上列兩種法令之規定，今孚中公司之業務情况，並非爲生產事業，純爲進出口貿易，徒予中外人士以不良觀感，對該公司自有依法處理之必要，而交通，金城，中國國貨三銀行，違背法令之處，亦應由財政部分別議處。</p>
<p>壬，查孚中公司總經理宋子良，協理沈鶴年，中國建設銀公司總經理宋子安，當時均以政府官員資格出國，各特有外交護照，今由其原供職機關，分別査明，已無官晨身份，（詳附件十七），而仍有外交護照，繼續居留外國，同時身任各大公司總經理或副總經理，無論在美，如外報所傳，從事商業活動與否，但以現業商人而持有外交護照逗留外國，其引起外大指摘，爲利用特權，不爲無因，應將上列各持有之外交　照，予以吊銷，免貽口實，今後政府當局對於外交曁官員護照，尤宜愼重簽發，並將現在持有外交曁官員護照人員，尙未返國者，分別加以調查，有無上列類似情事，依法處理，以重國際聲譽。</p>
<p>癸，自本年二月十七日實施經濟緊急措施方案以後，政府對於入口物品，無論結匯與否，均予嚴厲限制，八月十八日更公告一切自備外匯之貨品，亦一概暫時停發入口許可證，然據上海報紙之記載，目前中外商人已運來上海物品，而未核准入口者，達總値美金一億元以上，（據財政部兪部長報吿，値美金四千萬元）此項貨品包括新聞紙，鉛片，不列名機器，肥料，藥品，汽車等物資，此項物資之輸入，事先均未得政府許可，抵滬以後，或運置海關倉庫，或散置碼頭，據委員等之實地巡察，散置於公和祥碼頭等處之各色汽車，即不下五六百輛，按照海關規定半月後不能領得入口許可證，即處以罰款，兩月以後，即予以沒收，長此不予適當處理，不歸損壞，即將流於走私，似此於個人於政府均爲損失，當局自宜從速決定妥善處理辦法，以免發生流弊也。右報吿謹呈院長于，監察委員何漢文，王冠吾，杜光勛，谷鳳翔，審計部審計萬榮斌，協審陳華元，十月一日。（按：本報吿所指附件均略。）。全文完。</p>

<h3>平衡會負責人表示　決計消滅外匯黑市</h3>
<p>港滬私設電台已交涉取締</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯基金平衡委員會負責人表示：連日外匯黑市之激漲，心理因素居多，不一定爲供求關係。平衡會之市價，乃根據國庫收支及市塲行情而作理智之決定，目前黑市匯價已進入瘋狂狀態，故市價決不盲目追隨黑市。近日東北戰局轉緊，游資逃避來滬，益以開放自備外匯之傳聞，凡此均爲刺激匯市之重要因素。本會希望取得各有關方面之協助，輿論界不作剌激性之報道，以謀匯市之穩定」。關於無許可證貨物入口事，某氏認爲准許入口後，所有人勢將按外匯黑市價格出售。故與安定國內物價，並無裨益。</p>
<p>又訊，據外匯基金平衡委員會負責人談，外匯黑市之暗潮，確有妨碳出口物資之難出，本委員會職司外匯之供求，自不容漠視，正設法消滅，現已接近白刃戰時期，決予投機者以致命之打擊。目前匯價之調整，決不跟隨黑市，仍以推動出口爲目的。其匯率之升降，仍以事實需要而決定。變動匯率，不過爲推動出口方法之一。其他尙有種種計劃配合，務使正當出口商人獲有出路，並增加外匯之來源。該負責人並强調消滅黑市，有絕對把握，但須政府核准其計劃，同時給予特權。又香港爲外匯黑市之根源，投機者均設有秘密電台，互通消息，現我政府已與港政府商有適常之措置，即可實施。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕某權威經濟學家談稱：照現在外匯黑市價格，及目前政府之發行數目估計，政府祇須以現有外匯準備金之一部份，即可將發行全敎收回。而政府所有之中紡公司產業，及敵僞房地產與剩餘物資，約値數萬美金，尙未計算在內。深盼政府趁此機會，嚴厲打擊此不合理之黑市投機者。聞黑市活動仍以一部份商業行莊爲中心，利用港滬私設電台，溝通消息，相互套做。金融主管機關，亟應加强檢査，嚴厲罰辦，以期殺一儆百。對於投機份子私設之電台，更盼軍警機關嚴予取締，俾黑市活動能澈底根絕云。</p>
<p>華股新買躊躇臨收多數疲挫</p>
<p>華股昨形勢飄忽，港申電續縮，業中人出後鵝進，疲後易回，貸款消息又傳，永紗又復由高急回，且以低盤結束。小型股及雜股，疲態愈顯，頗多軋低者。良以减低證金，已遭打擊，永紗而外，咸遭淘汰。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>以報載遞延交易之證金財部表示決難減低之說而稍低，開後即交永紗自三〇二元半，遞交三一五元起，由一一六號等售，退至二九七元及三一一元。二三七號等進遞交，一六三號等進即交，回升至三〇四元及三一九元。一五七號二一八號即來脫手現遞永紗，二二六號等亦有賣出，塲外息價開低至二角四及二角八分半，但須負担四天之多，仍被迫低至即交二九六元，遞交三一三元。入後二二三號出永紗而進信和，一七二號供給現永紗，形勢不定。八九號等進現永紗，三六號等買進遞永紗，近午重復拉上，一五六號力購現永紗，於是即交以三〇五元高價收市，遞交達三二〇元，而後以三一九元結束，結果較前收即交股計永紗中絲火柴榮豐小升，中興麗安升半成，內衣水泥閘北華新恒護均平，新光景福中法新華中紡跌半成，餘均微降。遞交股計景福跌半成，永紗徵升，除均小挫。</p>

<h3>中國社會經濟史論</h3>
<p>— 黃祥隆</p>
<p>余精一著　東西文化社發行</p>
<p>照出版的年月，本書算是一本新書，它是在抗戰結束後的三十四年十月才初版發行的。據作者的自序，其所擬作的中西社會經濟發展史論，共分四編：第一編爲世界歷史學說新論，第二編爲中國農業社會史論（即中國社會經濟史論），第三編爲西洋商業社會史論，第四編爲世界各國雙系文化史論。截至筆者撰此稿時，余先生的第三編第四編尙未問世；因此筆者也就只讀了第一編世界歷史學說新論與第二編中國農業社會史論。</p>
<p>本來照例先要介紹第一編的，但是對於這歷史學說的新理論，筆者準備暫不討論它。至於第二編則旣不如第一編一樣屬於純歷史哲學的範疇，並且余先生又指出郭沫若，李季，陶希聖，衛聚賢，森谷克己，施復亮等之說爲批判的對象，從而建立其自己的學說，因此即以本書作爲一册中國社會經濟史看，是確有其完整性和眞實性的：筆者也就先在此提出介紹。</p>
<p>全書共分五章：第一章史前史槪論，第二章三代奴隸社會說批判，第三章三代封建社論，第四章秦漢至淸社會性質，第五章近百年社會性質，分章亦即是劃代，余先生的意思以史前史爲一期，屬於原始羣與民族社會時代，夏商周爲對建社會時代，秦漢至淸爲半封建社會時代，近百年爲次殖民地社會，至於其劃分的準則，除余先生用了「先破而後立」的方法批判郭沫若諸人之外，便是他的農業文化系統的學說，這點關於歷史發展的二元論，是否有全部的　實性，我們雖不敢承認，但對於以農業文化系統來說明中國社會經濟史，以及用土地制度變革來劃分中國社會階段，則確有其價値。</p>
<p>史前史的原始羣和民族社會，大抵是沒有多少問題的。三代以來旣爲中國歷史之起點，於是谷派學者亦就注意它而有種種不同的理論。首先因爲三代的社會性質，很難分析，但他們郤都承認三代會經過奴隸社會的階段，余先生首先以李季的中國社會史論戰批判，衛聚賢的古史研究，及郭沫若中國古代社會硏究爲主要的批判對象，推論各家的錯誤，又從奴隸與奴隸社會之分別，以農奴爲奴隸之誤解，及引證恩格斯，森谷克己諸入之說判斷中國史上從無奴隸社會。余先生的主張，則以三代爲封建社會。</p>
<p>秦漢至淸社會性質，有郭沫若　初民主張之封建社會，及李李之前資本主義生產方法說，與森谷克己中國歷史一個半階段說等。這兩種說法，前者大抵犯了土地的領有爲國有，封建與商業的並進，及認中國道地的莊園制度爲封建等等錯誤；後者一方面是支解了馬克斯「亞細亞生產方法」及「前資本主義的生產方法」，一方面是不能把握中國的重心，而發爲「未成熟的封建社會」的理論。余先生則以他們不是依樣　了別人的葫蘆，全部　入「四階段公式」，便是把握不住中國歷史，秦漢以來的「封建制與郡縣制對立，貴族制與官僚制並行，中央集權與地方分　同時存在，均山制與私產制同時發展的中國社會。</p>
<p>至於近百年社會性質，有陶希　，鄧初民之半對建說，郭沫若，李季，施復毫之資本主義社會說，實則前者只看車近百年來封建的殘渣，後者似乎又以局部的商業都市代表了整個社會。於此，余先生引　及玄氏雅片戰爭以後中國社會經濟　變的動向和特徵一文，以爲我國社會經濟的現階段，是在內潰和外鑠兩方面夾攻扮演出來的。其動向爲：　由鎖國經濟到被動開放的世界經濟，　由地方經濟到都市中心的國民經濟，　由農村經濟到中外通商的市場經濟，　由舊式生產經濟到產業革命經濟，　由地主集團經濟到資本經濟，　由單純商品經濟到貨幣中心經濟。其特徵爲：過渡性，複雜性，被動性，發展不均性，次殖民地性，買辦集團性，及社會浪費性等。由上之動向與特徵，余先生以爲我國現階段的社會經濟，包括四項重要內容：　表現商工業的資木主養對於農業的封建社會經濟之入侵，必然會促進封建主義社會經濟之崩潰與資本主義的生長，　表現外來的商業文化侵入固有的農業文化文化後，必然會引起整個文化系統的復合的變化，　表現列强之競相剝削，使中國經濟社會，雖欲資本主義化而不易前進，　表現一切新式資本主義的經濟建設發展過程中，必然要受列强間競爭與　斷的影響。這四項內容，余先生是用以說明近百年中國爲次殖民地社會的，尤以第四點表現出。中國正在生長的上有權威的新式資本主義的經濟，完全受列强帝國主義的支配，正是充分表現中國國家近百年來之「次殖民地」性質的特徵。由認近百年爲次殖民地國家，余先生便順帶指出，今後中國在走上國家社會主義之前，必先要解除「次殖民地」的一切束縛。</p>
<p>本　雖有它的完整性和正確性，可作社會經濟史看，但它對於史料的採取，却　然不够。不過從一個建設性的中　道地的社會經濟史着眼，本書可能作爲一個楔子，以供一警。我介紹此　，很希望海內積學深思之士，能廣博而深入的寫出一木　卷的中國社會經濟史來，因爲這種書現在很需要：同時又尙付諸缺如的。</p>
<h3>略談目錄學</h3>
<p>— 孝魯</p>
<p>目錄學範圍很廣，頭　複雜，硏究實不容易。何謂目錄？漢書藝文志大序云：「每一盡閱已，向輒條其篇目，撮其指意，錄而奏之。」由此可，所謂目便是篇篇目而已；除錄篇目之外加叙文。普通一般人以爲目錄便是書底名稱，其實不然，目錄不單是書底名稱，甚至一篇文章也有它的目錄存在，而且還要依其性質分門別類，如圖畫性質，人名性質等均屬之。這種編排目錄，中國早已有之。如：</p>
<p>一，書目　劉歆　七略（主）圖目班固漢書藝文志（副）</p>
<p>二，書法目錄　隋書（涉到藝術的）</p>
<p>三，金石碑帖目錄宋志（指刻板的）</p>
<p>四，著作人名目新唐書（即今之人名卡）</p>
<p>硏究中國目錄，先要觀察編目的動機。編寫中國目錄之動機有二：一屬於歷史性的；一屬於應用的。歷史性的目錄，以學術思想爲對象；由考證和調査而得到的目錄學材料，供給學者硏究或參考。應用的目錄學，如同商業上的進貨式或理貨式的帳簿一樣，以便利管理與檢査；所以它的作用以管理爲對象。硏究者當以前者為重要。</p>
<p>關於中國目錄的起始，根據歷史上說始於漢武帝藏書之策。有專著出現，當推劉向進貨式的別錄，與劉歆理貨式的七略爲最早。道二種目錄學書籍，頗和現代圖書目錄相似。班固取劉向的別錄和劉歡的七略，編成漢書　文志，這便是一本圖書歷史文獻。他以書的自錄爲對象，傳述前人的事蹟，屬於歷史性的。自班固的漢書藝文志以後，都沒有漢　藝文志一樣好的一類書出現；可見編撰目錄學，是極不容易的。在這裏已經知道班固的漢書藝文志由別錄七略編著成的，所以此三書實有一貫系統，硏究者宜從此着手。</p>
<p>目錄學的宗旨是什麼？且舉幾個專著來說明，在那裏面又可看出目錄學者是怎樣去編寫目錄學的：</p>
<p>一，班固以目錄之宗旨在「辨章學術源流」（參看漢書藝文志序文）。</p>
<p>二，阮孝緖（深朝）著七錄，他以爲目錄宗旨：　在質的方面說：　辨研究學術源流，　申明著述宗旨。在量的方面：　名稱卷數異同，　補充現目之缺略（參考七錄序文）。</p>
<p>三，長孫無忌隋書經籍志　本阮之條例，　删削名目並緖義，不合當代思想或雜亂的删去，與本書宗旨隅得太　亦芟去。</p>
<p>四，許心善之七林中·大都宗守阮孝緖之方法來編寫。</p>
<p>五，釋智昇釋敎序錄一書，對中國目錄學有很大貢獻，他以爲編目錄之宗旨在：　辨眞僞，　明是非，　記人代之古今，　標卷部之多少，　摭拾遺漏，　删夷駢。</p>
<p>有人以爲目錄已經成爲過去的東西，不必去研究，這是錯誤的，因爲目錄學是各種學問之總匯；自有研究的價値，由上段所引目錄學者說法來看，目錄學並且是一種讀書入門，王鳴盛在十七史商榷中說得好：「目錄之學，學中第一要緊，必從此問途，方能得其門而入，」可證目錄學之東要。</p>

<h3>率眞集</h3>
<p>— 從周</p>
<p>豐子愷著　萬葉書店出版</p>
<p>率眞集是　子愷先生去年出的散文集，在以前豐先生有二本散文集，就是緣緣堂隨筆與緣綠堂再筆，都是開明書店出版的，風行全國，豐先生的文章中，充滿了閒適與天眞的氣象，我就是被感化較深的一個，我因豐先生文章的關係，進一步去認識了弘一法師，再進一步去讀了藝術與文學，到今日尙在這圈子中討生活，不能不說多少受點影響。　先生大家知道他是個藝術家，然而這是看了他漫盡的綠故，他的文與　，是由宗敎，藝術，哲學，敎育，等綜合成功的，在故人與治學上，都完全表露出來，因此他的文章，冲淡雋永，能移人亦就是這個理由。</p>
<p>率眞集分兩部份，根據　先生自序，知道內中十篇作於抗戰中，九篇是以前天馬書店所刊隨筆二十篇當中的九篇，因此這本集子，也可說是豐先生散文的精華了。最近在圖書館中看到，不見豐先生文久矣！於是化了一個半夜，挑燈　竟，掩卷神往不已，覺得此書很可爲靑年修養方面的指導，不得不介紹一番，上卷的「爲靑年說弘一法師」，及「悼丐師」，在師道淪亡的今日，爲師者，爲生者，均宜一讀，我憧憬當今絃歌之樂，對所謂「尊師」發生浩歎。「辭緣緣堂，」不　爲抗戰中亂離的寫照，人所難言，盡形於筆墨，我最愛他描寫綠綠堂的四時樂。「沙坪小屋的鵝，」可謂人之情足以及禽獸，中卷是關於藝術方面爲多，我也不二介紹了，我認爲一個學藝術文學的人，能抱豐先生的那樣態度去治學，去體會，去應用，便不寂寞，便不頹廢，古人說「萬物靜觀皆自得，四時佳景與人同，」那末無時無刻不在快活中。下卷的文章，多半是發表過的，談人生，談兒童，我希望不愛兒童的人，與學習兒童敎育的人，或中年感槪多的人，不妨去看看，多少對「赤子之心」發生同情。</p>
<p>有人說豐先生的文是「藝術家的文」，不錯，豐先生已做到了眞善美，不過這似乎是單方面了，我們細讀他的文章，可說是鎔藝術新舊文學哲學宗敎與敎育等於一爐，在今日的新文壇上，不能不說是成功的一位。</p>
<h3>守財虜葛蘭德</h3>
<p>— 若非</p>
<p>巴爾扎克創造底典型人物</p>
<p>「歐貞妮·葛蘭德」，是巴爾扎克的「人間喜劇」中以描寫法蘭西外省生活爲主題的一部傑作，高爾茶讀了它後，會在其自傳中一再提起它，在這裏，巴爾扎克寫出了理性與貪慾的衝突，寫出了父女兩代的距離，而最爲形象化的則是葛蘭德先生的搜刮金錢時的情形，作者將葛蘭德先生當作守財虜的典型人物，他寫出葛蘭德怎樣對待他的破了產的姪子；爲了女兒私自送堂弟以金錢，他又如何地震怒；他的妻子被他的震怒駭病了，而他所首光想到的是妻子的遺產將落入女兒之手，因此憂慮之至，深更半夜，他怎樣鎖起門來在倉庫中數金錢，不給任何人知道；摸一　金錢，彷彿就能治愈他的　病；長後，他臨死時要求把金路易陳列在桌子上，他的眼睛就呆呆的盯視着，說：「這使我暖和過來了！」死後遺留給他唯一的女兒說：「留意金子呀！……把金子放在我面前好啦！」</p>
<p>這部小說中只有兩個主人公：萬蘭德先生和他的女兒歐貞妮。而他倆恰巧代表了兩種人性；前者視財若命，除了金錢外什麽也不曾看到，自舉或待人，均甚刻薄，却又常常是不自覺的，以爲搜刮金錢，實在就是人生唯一要務，後者最初還是個少女，一向以父親的意志爲意志，但家庭中自從　入了堂弟查　後，她才「撥雲　而見天日」，發　父親的許多舉指，均　背了人性，違反了父子兄弟間的至情，於是下童識中對父親的貪　有　　憎。如果說葛蘭德先生的人性已被金錢所掩沒，那麽女兒歐貞妮也不過是個徽弱的對照。她覺得她應該挽救堂　查禮，她必須同情弱者，必須在愛情的按排下和父親抗爭，然而出世以來在葛蘭德的約束下過着日子的她，畢竟仍不足以與父親的貪慾相抗。當葛蘭德發覺女兒把金錢私送給堂弟了時，他就暴跳如雷，女兒則沉默而勇敢地走向禁閉室中，這時要不是査禮的愛情在支持着她，誰知道會不會像她母親一樣，駭得患上一塲大病呢？</p>
<p>査禮的父親破了產，事先即命査禮投奔伯父葛蘭德，而査禮自己一點也不知情，還以爲他自己在作着冬季旅行。葛蘭德必須把事實眞相吿訴訴査禮。</p>
<p>「是的，可憐的孩子，你猜吧，他死了。然而還不算，還有更慘的事情，他是用手槍打腦門自殺的……」査禮告訴他的姪兒。</p>
<p>「我的父親？」</p>
<p>「好啦。」葛蘭德又接着高聲說：「這還不算什麽要緊，我可　的侄兒，這還不算，您可以安慰您自己，但是……」</p>
<p>「絕不會，絕不會，我的父親！我的父親！」</p>
<p>「他把您毀了！您一個錢也沒有！」</p>
<p>「錢有什麼用？我父親在那兒？」査禮追問。</p>
<p>痛哭　可怕地　　在　　間，查禮跑掉了——他　臥在自己床上，把臉孔蒙在被窩裏。</p>
<p>「應當讓這一陣暴風雨過去，」葛蘭德心裏想，一面走進大廳，「然而，這個年輕人一點用處也沒有的，他關心死者比關心金錢還利害。」</p>
<p>巴爾扎克運用了　精彩的描寫，在這裏寫出葛蘭德先生對弟弟的死的看法。守財虜們原是最短視的，他們眼中沒有什麼「將來」，現世就是他們的一切。拜金主義的社會，世紀末頹廢色彩極濃的社會，就整個地活躍在巴爾扎克的筆下。</p>
<p>查禮拿走了歐琴妮的五千八百法郞，却給了她一個藏有照相的金匣，要她代爲保存，而主要的意思，也許是作爲愛情的象徵吧。這金匣後來給葛蘭德先生發現了，於是他說這匣子已儘可抵充歐琴妮所借給査禮的法郞，一面就拿小刀子來挖取匣子上的金片，這時歐琴娓顯得非常勇敢，甚至不惜以死抗爭，巴爾扎克將這一塲面寫得極美。他寫出金匣在葛蘭德眼中是金光耀眼的金子，也寫出在歐琴妮眼中則是聖潔無比的愛情的信物。「實利」和「理想」鬥爭，結果是前者　了壁。</p>
<p>然而結局呢，査禮放浪至印度後，以販賣奴隸而大發橫財，他也逐漸由「理想」走向伯父們重視「實利」的階段了。返巴黎後，他看中了某爵士的女兒，希望能承繼丈人的爵位，早將歐琴妮的愛情抛諸腦後。爲了　取金匣，他寫了一封信給歐琴妮，並匯上八千法郞匯票一張，算是償還借款，連本帶利地。至於金匣，則請她交公共馬車寄去。</p>
<p>「由公共馬軍寄去！」歐琴妮說，「一千次幾乎爲他而喪失我的生命的東西」。</p>
<p>歐琴妮後來嫁給了當地法院的院長彭風，　帶葛蘭德先生的一千七百萬遺產。</p>
<p>自然，作爲女財主，她是幸福的，無時無刻不在人們包圍中，不在聽取別人的阿諛諂媚；可是作爲一價有良知的女性，她內心又多麽寂寞！生活又多麼黯淡，在包圍着她的人們眼裏，她只是些金光燦爛的法郞的化身，誰又能眞正瞭解默琴妮胸內的那顆溫順·堅貞·誠擊的心呢。</p>
<p>巴爾扎克嘆息了：實利主義萬歲！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>袖的浪漫史</h3>
<p>— 未壯</p>
<p>文明人穿衣服，兩只袖子是不可少的，自黃帝始制衣裳，幾千年來袖子的歷史，也够悠久了罷。</p>
<p>在這人慾橫流，紀綱蕩然之秋，我們幾曾聽見過做了一任官，下得台來兩袖淸風的？反之，暗箭傷人，出之袖籠的，倒是呌人防不勝防！君子　然而嘆！袖乎，袖乎，誠難言之矣。</p>
<p>讀陳後主詩：「轉身移　響，牽袖起衣香」句，我們又彷彿覺得有一個窈窕的絕色女子，驚鴻一　，呌人忽起遐想。而蒙古人吃了牛油茶之後，把袖子管朝嘴邊一抹，久而久之，光可鑑人。其不敬而遠之者，亦幾希。</p>
<p>漢哀帝斷袖故事，宮闈陰私，言不雅馴，可略即略。見義而不勇爲，袖手旁觀者，太不熱心，未免那同。處今之處，不順眼的事觸目皆是，不入耳之言到處可聞，準呌你要拂袖而起。在上的借公濟私，在下者投機取巧，腰纏十萬，（美金）美其名曰長袖善舞，令人汗毛站背。</p>
<p>西裝　至三四百萬一套，袖口上的鈕子，身價百倍，其出處自不得不從詳考叙，以示隆重。莫輕看這小小幾棵紐子，還是軍國主義的雄主，普魯士腓特烈大帝的遺風。當時他最講究軍人的風紀，服裝必須十分整齊。無如兵士們遇到臉上淌汗，遍遍舉起手把袖子權充抹布，拚命朝面上揩擦。不容說，兩只袖子弄得骯　異常。</p>
<p>腓特烈心生一計，下令在袖子管上釘一排鈕子，以後兵士們雖欲有所舉動，無奈面孔要被擦破，只得作罷。據說，西裝上的袖鈕，原係用作捲袖　束，以便利做事的，後來却漸漸失去效用，弄到袖底下，作爲百無一用的裝飾品了。</p>
<p>用袖子擦汗，雖縉紳先生亦難免，蓋亦救急之道也。十餘年前一個熟天，郭復初（泰祺）氏任職滬上，參加一個公共的集會，站在高台上演說，因爲天熟，汗涔涔下，殊不可耐，他伸手朝懷中一摸，失望，忘帶了手帕，於是不得不出以比較原始的動作，索性把夏布長衫的袖子頻頻揩擦。結果，兩只袖子管弄得濕成一團，藏在袖子裏的手，很不自然底抓動着。好像票友初次登合，水袖工夫尙未到家，弄得兩手無措，很窘的樣子。因爲在下那時也在台上，看得很淸楚，至今印象還深哩。</p>
<p>新聞記者在袖口上用速記符號紀錄演詞，見之書本，而未目覩，可靠否，待考。不過珠實商人在茶會上做生意時，兩人目成之後，不交一言，雙手互相伸人對方的袖子裘，用晴號講價鈿，這倒是事實。假定談得入港，雙方緊張的面部，　會逐漸地軟化起來，好像冬夫的朝上，起初露出一絲陽光，後來愈光明，愈旺熱，終之達到最高潮，彼此把袖子一甩，幾乎笑出聲來，這表示：「買賣成交了！」</p>
<h3>新疆的水菓</h3>
<p>— 阿水</p>
<p>新疆的水菓，以瓜·蘋果·葡萄·梨·桃爲佳。瓜指甜瓜，哈密瓜即甜瓜之一種，迪化人稱爲「甜瓜」，不大稱爲「哈密瓜」。這是大如沈頭的香瓜，惟甜脆及水份之多，非南方任何佳種香瓜所及。此瓜產於初夏，窖藏可保存至明年春末；新疆人每謂夏秋食此瓜則内熱，惟冬日食之，如　冰忌淋，則方「繪　」。</p>
<p>蘋果出產頗多，而伊黎之二台所產最佳，體大而肉脆；色味極似舶來的金山蘋果，而香過之</p>
<p>葡萄以吐魯番所產爲最佳，無核之一種，雖小而甜，晒爲乾，似猶勝於美國所產。</p>
<p>石榴甚大，粒粒如紅寶石。</p>
<p>梨以庫車及庫爾勒所產最佳，雖不甚大，而甜·脆·水份多，天津梨最好者，亦不及之。</p>
<p>南疆植桑之區，桑葚亦大而味美，有黑色白色兩種；惟此物易燦，不能運之他處。當地維族人民之游手好閒者，每當桑葚熱時，常以果腹。</p>
<h3>美國的種種</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>美國不僅是個特別的國度，並且是個變化多端而又不易瞭解的國家；但許多人都說不暸解美國，便不能瞭解時代，你們說奇怪不奇怪呢？有多得如汗牛充棟的詩文，拚命地讚美美國，然而它很容易被人　頌，也很容易被人譏嘲。是的，充滿着矛盾的美國，在複雜技藝的背面，常常匿藏着精神的單純，而在這單純的背後，却又有意想不到的複雜。</p>
<p>一般人對於美國的文學看得很高是沒有問題的，但那些插圖週刊登載的作品，却是一個文學的眞空，它低級和糟糕到連歐洲極隨便的讀者都要退避三舍。</p>
<p>美國正不繼地盡了很大的努力而提高他們的智識水準，他們有設備極爲完全的大學，最的圖書館和實驗室都附設在麥面。在那裏，科學家之受人市視，是司空見慣的事。但田愛西洲（Tennesee）大學奇怪得令人不敢置信，因爲這一間學校不准演講進化論；那兒的法律禁止講任何違背聖經上亞當和夏娃神話的理論</p>
<p>美國的大城市中，都有「雄獅」的俱樂部。有名的商人都聚集那兒，每人都配帶一個牌子，寫明他的營業性質和地點。他們在吃點心之前，要站起來　仿獅吼的「呼呼嗚嗚」的聲音。這種玩兒還算是件純潔的事情。與豪商富賈並行的也有許多純　夢想者和高尙的理想家；他們信仰烏托邦主義，他們廢　忘餐，罄其所有的金錢和精力致力於實現「世界政府」的玄妙計劃。</p>
<p>人人都知道在美國尊敬是圍撓着金錢的。在千百個登記的敎堂和敎派——金元；但美國也有自已不買新鞋不看電影而將省下人被判罪而死在　椅之上。不過，到處都有保障黑人權利的組織；美國的好人時時在反對種族的野蠻迫書。</p>
<p>美國人充滿了孩子氣，他們不　揉造作，他們坦白，好奇，吵閙，他們好動；當他們坐在屋　時，喜歡常站起來，而且常換坐位；他們毫不遲疑地從這個城移到那個城，從這個州移到那個州。美國人的性格與風格恰與英國人相反。英國人有禮貌而寗靜；他喜歡長居住在且老死於他祖父遣留的家中；他們喜定做頭等料子的衣服，假使不能穿到死時，至少要穿到下次大選。美國人只喜歡新衣服，穿一穿就扔掉。他們常買不値一洗的襯衣；他們重視舊　石，而喜鮮艷的新領帶</p>
<p>美國的事物都是新的；但在新粵材州的法人區內十七八世紀建築的房屋都保存着；還個「古區」是人所　往的地方。</p>
<p>在美國，惱人的事件常常掩蓋人們的歷史感；對於普通美國人，晨報與晚報中間，幾乎換個時代，因爲早晨使地們苦惱的事情，晚間他們常常就忘掉了。</p>
<p>有人說要想瞭解美國，須常常記着它的年齡；這句話頗堪耐人尋味。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐上銀幕</p>
<p>由於電影工業的發達，電影演員的受大衆崇拜，除了老醜不堪或已捨身爲尼者以外，我　敢說沒有一個美國少女，不想攀登銀色御座，一嘗明星滋味的。確實，好萊塢是世界上惟一的誘人地方，那裏有最高的薪給，有最優裕的生活，有最富麗的別墅，有最新型的汽車，誰不想去享受一下。不過好萊塢機會雖多，却不易在銀色圈中立脚，如有一技之長雖鷄鳴狗盜之流，也可成爲明星，如無一技之長，雖在好萊　困守一輩子，也是不得其門而入。電影公司的老闆都是在勢利圈中翻過觔斗的人，他需要你時，他會跪在你的大門口，他不需要你時，他會把你一脚踢開，每年有成萬的富家少女帶了大宗美鈔來好萊塢交際，想踏進電影公司之門，結果是失敗而歸，可是懂得訣竅，並不雖攀登銀后寶座，先得利用舞台，夜總會，模特兒公司，　報，爲脚躋石。很多舞台的演員，夜總會的歌星，模特兒公司的棋特兒，畫報的封面女郎，被電影公司代表　致到好萊塢去，平地登夭，一躍而爲紅星，電影公司寗可以重價聘請已成功的劇藝人才，却不願化錢自行訓練演員，任憑用何種科學方法，都不能騐出眞正的劇藝人才，所以電影公司不願預先費一筆本錢。美國的女性個個富有戲劇性的，羅致人才尙無困難，有些女明星不會演劇，但能溜冰，或能騎馬，或能游泳，也可成爲紅得發紫的大明星，導演及編劇專以溜冰或騎術或游泳爲題材而攝成影片，這種人才在中國電影界裏一個也找不出，美國電影工業的成功，決不能完全歸功於電影巨頭的組織力量，美國女性應居首功。美國電影出品，很少不以女演員爲主角的片子，女角主演的片子就一定有大腿，大腿是美國的國寳，Marlene　Dietrich的大腿曾經保險過二百萬美金，那還是十年以前的代價，現在通貨膨脹常然不止此數。女人一踏進了電影公司之門，好比一登龍門，身價十倍，就此有了好萊塢明星的頭銜，除了公司裏有優厚的薪酬外，她們兼在廣播電台播音，在唱片公司灌片，在大學裏担任常影講師，所以她們的收入是多方面的，即使一旦從銀壇上跌下來，也不致就此失業，還可以向電台，舞台，夜總會，模特兒公司發展。到好萊塢鍍過金的女人，在生活上彷彿多了一重保障，美國社會對好萊塢人物一向是另眼相待的。</p>
<p>人物誌</p>
<h3>海軍耆宿薩鎭冰</h3>
<p>— 一荒</p>
<p>據　曾經　赫一時的海軍上將薩鎭冰氏，近來也非常潦倒了。報上說：在上海航界服務的吳淞商船學校友們，見到老校長晚景蕭條，特地每人捐出五十萬元，集款放息，每月寄往福建，以維持薩氏生活。</p>
<p>有人奇怪：爲什麽做過海軍總長福建省長的大員，會得如此一貧如洗呢？這正是薩老先生的可敬佩處。曾經聽到過薩氏的性格和處世的人，一定知道他的檢與　，實有過人之處。</p>
<p>常薩氏在上海任吳淞商船學校校長的時候，當時似乎還兼任海軍部耍職，照理說，他很可以在上海蓋一座洋房，購置一輛汽車，但是薩氏不然，他往來必搭乘電車，開旅館也只開二等房間。他在福建任省長時，每天早晨便衣赴小菜塲，親自餐置菜　　魚，回家交僕人預備午餐。每次出門，老是携傘一柄，從無隨從同行。</p>
<p>薩氏早年畢業於英國格林威治皇家海軍學校，爲淸廷創辦海軍時最早在國外訓練海軍軍官之一〇一八九四至九五年的第一次中日甲午戰事，他曾身預其役。辛亥革命的那一年，他在淸廷任職海軍提督，奉淸廷命統率長江水師前往武漢剿「匪」，然而他却早已和革命軍「秋波頻繁」，　隊開到九江，下令開砲　擊，但「只許開朝天砲，不准傷人。」已故國民政府主席林森，常時就在薩氏　下，終於由林森會同薩氏發動「叛變」，　應革命軍。「朝天砲」也紫性不開了，把艦隊換了番號，同到上海來。</p>
<p>薩氏脫離政治舞台以後，致力於慈善事業，到現在大約有三十年左右了，但是在政界仍保持相當盛　，現在還是海軍總司令部的高級顧問。一九三四年的　變，所以能不流血而迅速解決，也多半是薩氏的功績。福建三尺童子，都知道這位慈祥可親的「　菩薩」，是怎樣一位了不起的人物。</p>
<p>聽得有這麽一段關於薩氏的故事：薩氏有一隨從男僕，做事頗爲勤懇，甚得薩氏賞識。結果薩氏把他的女兒嫁給了那位男僕，而這位「受寵若驚」的新女婿，婚後力求上進　居然飛黃　達起來。——假如這些是事實，那麽薩氏這種絲毫不存階級觀念的胸懷，是値得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，中央特派　氏，出使南洋宣慰僑胞，以八十餘歲的高齡，往來奔波，爲國宣勞。任務完成後，西上重慶復命，深得中央嘉許。　後，又作西北之行，川陜甘各地，皆有將軍足跡，春秋雖高，猶能據鞍馳騁，顧盼自如。閒來吟詩弄文，壯志非淺。</p>
<p>勝利後，他從內地回來，到過上海，不久就回到福建原籍，去年因息血管硬化症，身體衰弱，　醫囑在家休養對時局也不大過問。在這裏，　祝將軍健康！</p>

<h3>After Victory, Chairman Chiang Visits Shenyang for the Third Time, Personally Gives Instructions on Unfinished Matters, and Flies Back to Beiping with Fu Zuoyi That Evening</h3>
<p>[Beiping Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong, went to the Air Force Second Military Region Headquarters at 10:20 AM on the 8th to instruct Air Force officers and encouraged them to promote a spirit of initiative and responsibility and cultivate habits of mutual assistance and cooperation. After the speech, they went to Xiyuan Airport together with Yu Jishi and Luo Zeqi, Director of the Third Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and others, and flew to Shenyang. In the evening, after 6 PM, they flew back to Beiping with Fu Zuoyi. He Siyuan greeted them at the airport. After Chairman Chiang got off the plane, he went into the city in the same car with Fu Zuoyi. That evening at 11 PM, he summoned Sun Yueqi, who had just returned from an inspection of the Ping-Sui Line, and Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters. Although Chairman Chiang went to Pan on the 8th, those who went to the residence to seek an audience and present letters were still in an endless stream, including Lee Chung-mo, a representative of Kim Gu of Korea, and a Mr. Bai. In addition, Chairman Chiang summoned Hu Shi and Mei Yi-qi at the residence at 9:30 PM on the 7th for about half an hour, and kept them for dinner until 10:30 PM before the two gentlemen took their leave.</p>
<p>[Beiping Dispatch from Associated Press, 8th] Chairman Chiang summoned De Wang here on the 8th to inquire about the situation in Mongolia. Some parties speculate that De Wang has a pivotal influence on the Mongolian people and that he may come out of retirement again.</p>
<p>[Shenyang Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] For the past three days, the streets of Shenyang have been filled with guards from the Provisional Headquarters carrying guns, and cleaners have been constantly sweeping the streets. The area in front of the Lizi Society is also closed to vehicles and pedestrians. The citizens all knew that the Chairman would be arriving. At noon on the 8th, the sky was clear and cloudless. When the sound of the plane engine crackled, many people raised their heads and pointed, saying, "Here it comes!" At 12:10 PM, the Chairman's special plane arrived at Beiling Airport. Eight fighter planes had been sent to the air to greet him in advance. Chen Cheng, Fu Zuoyi, civil and military officials, and local elders all went to the airport to respectfully greet him. Chairman Chiang got off the plane with a smile and shook hands with Chen, Fu, and others. Chairman Chiang wore a grass-green Zhongshan suit, a black cloak, and an iron-gray felt hat, looking radiant and frequently nodding to those who welcomed him. Then he went to the city with Chen and Fu in the same car. When the car passed the Dongda University gate, students stood to greet him respectfully, and the people along the way also paid solemn respect to the winding convoy of cars for several miles. Still unaware of the Chairman's arrival, the Chairman's car arrived at the Lizi Society to rest. He then received the Shenyang military and political leaders, local elders, and listened to military reports from Chen Cheng and others, and gave instructions. He flew back to Ping at 4 PM. Those who came with the Chairman this time included Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, Huang Juemin, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>[Shenyang Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Chairman Chiang's visit to Pan during the tense stage of the Northeast war greatly encouraged the military and civilians here. Chairman Chiang received senior generals and gave instructions in person, and it is generally believed that this is the starting point for a turn for the better in the war situation. The Communist bandits' offensive has reached its climax, but it will also be revealed that they are at the end of their rope. This is Chairman Chiang's third visit to the Northeast after the victory.</p>
<p>[Beiping Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Madame Chiang stayed in Ping to rest on the 8th. At 6:30 PM in the evening, she received Fei Xuesui, the Mayor of Dalian, to discuss the issue of rescuing refugees in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Liu Slinks to Eastern Hubei, Plotting to Disturb the Yangtze Defenses, Wuhan Implements Alert, and after Recovery of Taihe in Northern Anhui, Bandits Flee to Eastern Henan</h3>
<p>[Hankou Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Military News: Several hundred remnants of the Liu bandits, after passing through Xinzhou, snuck into the area north of Tuanfeng (that is, the Yangtze River coast north of Huanggang). Another group of over a thousand bandits fled from Jiujie to Linshanhe (near Tuanfeng), attempting to disrupt the Yangtze River defenses. Our army is encircling and suppressing them. Our air force sorties day and night to assist in the battle, conducting extensive bombing of the bandit troops who snuck into various parts of eastern Hubei, and destroyed more than a dozen bandit barracks from Zhongguan Post to Songbu, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits.</p>
<p>[Hankou Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Wuhan implemented an alert (not martial law) from 11 PM on the 8th to prevent the activities of petty thieves.</p>
<p>[Bengbu Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Chen Yi's troops, who were entrenched in Taihe, were fiercely attacked by the advancing National Army and recovered on the 7th.

<h3>People in the Bandit Areas of the Northeast Eagerly Await the National Army to Rescue Them</h3>
<p>Eavesdropping on Broadcasts Called "Sugar Cake"</p>
<p>[Changchun Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] The number of Communist bandits who surrender is increasing day by day. Most of them are educated youths from the Northeast with boiling blood and just 20 years old. It is said that the people in the bandit areas eagerly hope that the National Army will quickly rescue them. Describing life in the bandit areas, they said: secret agents run rampant, and a little carelessness can lead to death. They loudly sing "Dig up the poor roots, dig up the bad roots, and carry out bloody struggle!" The number of people who die unnaturally in the bandit areas is unknown. Their longing for the central government is indescribable. They call listening to government broadcasts "sugar cake," meaning that although it is not sweet, it still has some sweetness. They all hope that the National Army can recover the vast unrecovered areas, and even more hope that they can use airplanes to carry a large number of propaganda materials to distribute in the unrecovered areas. One of the more knowledgeable youths said: the bandits are quite good at propaganda. Taking the launch of this offensive as an example, the bandits printed propaganda materials with extremely large Northeast bank notes and distributed them with the army in the recovered areas.</p>

<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 8th] Dong Xian Guang answered reporters' questions at a press conference as follows: Question: It is said that Madame Chiang will send representatives to the Northeast to console the military and civilians. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: The Northeast Relief Association, presided over by Madame Chiang, plans to send representatives to the Northeast to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people. However, the candidates have not yet been determined. Before the victory, the Northeast suffered a long period of brutal rule by the Japanese, and then was ravaged by Communist bandits. The people suffered all kinds of hardships. This summer, it was hit by floods again, inundating more than 2.7 million mu of farmland and affecting more than 500,000 people. The property loss is estimated to be as much as two to three trillion national currency. The Northeast Relief Association initiated by Madame Chiang plans to raise 1 billion Northeast circulating currency for relief funds, and the current progress is very smooth.</p>

<h3>National Army Confluence in the Western Liaoning Corridor, Fierce Fighting Continues in Tieling, Situation Stabilizes in Yingkou, Part of the Bandit Troops South of Siping Surrounded</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shenyang, 8th] Although the war on the Northeast front was very fierce on the night of the 7th, it was quite stable during the day of the 8th. In addition, the National Army in the Western Liaoning Corridor converged, and the head of state's visit to the Northeast has greatly increased people's confidence, but it has also increased vigilance. The great battle between Tieling and Kaiyuan in the Northern Route has gradually unfolded. Kaiyuan Station, which is the location of the new Kaiyuan, is surrounded by bandits. Although the old Kaiyuan has fallen into the hands of the bandits, the National Army is still firmly defending the new Kaiyuan and the station. On the night of the 6th, 130,000 bandits attacked Kaiyuan Station in several directions but failed. Although bandits on both sides of the railway a dozen miles south of Tieling constantly plot to cut off the rear of Tieling, trains between Tieling and Panjin can still pass thanks to the National Army's intensified expulsion by land and air forces. In addition, the war around Tieling has not stopped. More than 5,000 bandits from Faku are stirring up trouble around Panjin, and are currently confronting the National Army near Jinfo City. In the Southern Route, the bandit forces in Yingkou retreated slightly during the day on the 8th after efforts by the land and air forces. In the Western Route, after the bandits captured Zhangwu, the air force flew to侦炸 on the 8th, and Xinlitun is quite tight. The Beining Line is being partially opened to traffic, and the National Army attaches great importance to the transportation on this line.

The Guannei section of the Beining Line has always maintained a decent level of prosperity. Although there is minor damage, it does not hinder the overall circulation. In addition, after the National Army from Guanjin arrived in Suizhong, the National Army in Xingcheng is also moving south. They will converge in Suizhong tonight.</p>

<h3>$30 Million in Relief Supplies Agreement to be Signed in Nanjing Within the Week, Emergence of the New Comintern Will Prompt the US to Actively Aid China</h3>
<p>[Washington Dispatch from the United Press, 7th] A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy announced today: China and the United States will sign an agreement in Nanjing this week stipulating that the United States will assist China with $30 million in relief supplies. This is part of the US's independent relief plan for China and several European countries after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling $35 million. The relief supplies to China include approximately 43,000 tons of rice, worth $11 million, 150,000 tons of wheat, worth $15 million, and $4 million worth of medical supplies. The distribution sites are mainly Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, and Tianjin. Relief supplies will be sold at fair prices under the supervision of US government personnel, and the proceeds will be used to continue purchasing supplies for resale. The International Food Relief Committee has already stored the above-mentioned quantities of rice and wheat for shipment. Among them, 28,000 tons of wheat and 43,000 tons of rice have already been purchased under contract and can be shipped to Shanghai as soon as the agreement is signed. The agreement also stipulates that US reporters in China may investigate the implementation situation.</p>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Associated Press, 8th] According to the results of tests conducted here last night, Chinese officials believe that the reaction to the new organization of European communist parties is the dawn of the establishment of the Fourth International, which may stimulate the United States to adopt a positive policy of political, military, and economic assistance to the National Government of China. They also believe that this matter is enough to make other countries understand the true nature of the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the result is enough to make the United States assist the National Government as soon as possible. They pointed out that although this communist organization is specifically designed to defeat the Marshall Plan in Europe, the Marshall Plan cannot be extended to Asia due to the emergence of the organization, especially to China and Korea. However, they also admitted that if the Marshall Plan were extended to China, it might force Moscow to include Asian communist parties in the new Fourth International.</p>

<p>Question: Has the Chinese government received official notification of the content of General Weidemai's report to President Truman? Will the Chinese government publish it?</p>
<p>Answer: No. The Chinese government knows nothing about the content of Weidemei's report to President Truman.</p>
<h3>The Democratic International, Zeng Qi Advocates Speedy Organization</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 8th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, recently issued a statement on the establishment of the new Comintern, saying: Proves that the abolition of the Third International in 1943 was a "strategic" retreat, and the old Lenin established the "Far Eastern Republic" to ease the attacks of various countries, and then announced the merger, which is the same conspiracy. After the war, totalitarian and democratic countries formed a clear confrontation, reducing the authority of the United Nations and increasing the threat to peace. The Chinese Communists, who possess military force, will accelerate their destructive movement with the support of this international organization in order to prevent the construction of democratic constitutionalism. The countermeasures, in terms of the world, are that democratic countries should break their habit of "acting on their own" and organize the "Democratic International" as soon as possible to counter the "Communist International." In terms of China, the constitution should be implemented on schedule according to the planned plan, and large-scale reforms should be implemented to crush the "destructive forces" of the Chinese Communists with strong "construction forces."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Reappearance of the Communist International</h3>
<p>Our newspaper already discussed the reappearance of the Communist International in yesterday's article, focusing on the Communist International itself and how we should deal with it. Now, we would like to further discuss it from the perspective of international politics.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that the reappearance of the Communist International cannot be said to be a new division in the international arena. The Communist International has always existed, and its appearance on the international political stage did not begin today. As for the declaration of its dissolution in May 1943, at most, it only canceled its name to the outside world. In reality, it still existed as before. This was already pointed out in yesterday's editorial. If the Communist International was dissolved in May 1943 in law (do juro), it existed in fact (do facto). Therefore, the reappearance of the Communist International is not a new division, but an old division that has already existed, re-hoisting its flag and preparing for war. This cannot be said to be a new Communist International or the Fourth International. Because in all aspects, the reappearance of the Communist International is actually the re-emergence of the Communist International or the Third International, which was established in 1919. In theory and in essence, it is not a new organization. We cannot believe that a notice of dissolution from Moscow means that this is the Fourth International, established after the First International, the Second International, the Second and a Half International, and the Third and Fourth Internationals. This is a point that we should recognize.</p>
<p>There are several points worth noting about the reappearance of the Communist International. First, the Communist parties in the Nordic countries, such as Finland, Norway, and Sweden, did not participate. Second, France and Italy are also listed within the Communist world. Regarding the first point, the non-participation of the Communist parties in the Nordic countries can be explained in two ways: First, the Soviet Union still hopes that the Nordic countries can permanently maintain neutrality and not participate in the world's struggles. Second, the Soviet Union has already considered the Nordic countries as part of the Soviet Union, so the Communist parties in those areas do not need to participate in this new declaration of the Communist International. Under totalitarianism, the Soviet Union, which aims to establish a Communist world, does not allow neutral countries to exist. Therefore, from the essence of its founding, we do not believe that the non-participation of the Nordic countries in the reappearance of the Communist International is to ensure their neutrality.</p>
<p>Speaking of France and Italy, this is undoubtedly the arena for the competition between Western democracy and communism. The Soviet Union's Iron Curtain has already extended from Szczecin on the Baltic Sea coast to Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. Germany, west of this line, is under the occupation of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Therefore, Italy and France have become the first line of defense in Europe for Western democracy against communism. Of course, the Kremlin is trying its best to seize them. Therefore, the participation of France and Italy in this re-emerging Communist International is a very natural thing. Due to the participation of the Communist parties of Italy and France this time, it will inevitably affect the future development of the political situation in the two countries. The Communist parties of Italy and France have considerable strength in their respective countries, while the People's Republican Movement in France and the Christian Democratic Party in Italy also have strong strength. Due to the participation of the Communist parties of the two countries in the declaration of the Roman capital, it may further enhance the momentum of the People's Republican Movement and the Christian Democratic Party. However, after the war, the economies of France and Italy are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people's livelihood is deteriorating day by day. If Western democratic aid does not arrive in time, the future is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>At this time, we see the reorganization of the British government. This reorganization of the Attlee government, apart from the dismissal of Shinwell, the Minister of Fuel and Power, did not have many noteworthy changes. The Labour government still maintains its stable tone. Originally, the British Labour Party had both left and right wings. People like Bevin and Morrison have the strength of local trade union organizations and are also relatively conservative figures. Intellectuals such as Health Minister Bevan are closer to radicalism. In this reorganization of the British government, Bevin, Morrison, Cripps, and others were not only not shaken but strengthened their positions. This can also be said to be a response from the United Kingdom to the reappearance of the Communist International. Although the United Kingdom lacks US dollars, and the domestic economic situation is also very difficult, the United Kingdom is still a major pillar of Western democracy. Looking at this reorganization of the British government, it further strengthens our belief in the world.</p>
<p>With the current world situation evolving in this way, the country that considers itself the "arsenal of democracy" naturally bears a greater responsibility. It should have a firm policy and timely use its strength to support its emerging countries, to respond to strength with strength, and to respond to organization with organization. We must not forget the Far East, because in the Far East, we see the outbreak of World War II. Only in this way can we ensure this democratic world and world peace!</p>

<h3>Party and Youth League Re-Registration</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) This method is formulated based on the "Current Organizational Outline of the Chinese Kuomintang" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The outline states that in order to rectify party discipline, corrupt and evil elements must be eliminated. At the closing of the revolutionary curtain, it was declared: "After the unification of the Party and Youth League organization this time, the first step will be to conduct a general registration of party members. This registration must expel corrupt and degenerate elements from the party to prevent them from mixing within the party." The Kuomintang Central Committee decided to conduct a general re-registration of party members and Youth League members in order to refresh the party's ranks. According to the provisions of this general registration method, party headquarters at all levels above the county level are responsible for organizing the registration. All party members who hold party membership cards or temporary party membership certificates, and Youth League members who hold Youth League membership cards or temporary Youth League membership certificates, except those whose party rights or Youth League rights have been suspended, shall apply for registration with their respective party headquarters within the prescribed time limit, and fill out a registration form. Party members and Youth League members who apply for registration and are found to have anti-party speeches or actions, are affiliated with other parties, create or participate in small organizations within the party to undermine party unity, are involved in corruption, or fail to pass the general review or general appraisal, will be deemed unqualified. Furthermore, party members and Youth League members who do not participate in the registration or participate in the registration but are ultimately deemed unqualified by the Central Committee will lose their party membership. For party members who apply for registration and are found to be qualified, the party headquarters organizing the registration will compile a roster, re-swear them in, and submit it to the Central Committee for the issuance of new party membership cards. Those who are unqualified must be submitted to the higher-level party headquarters for review or submitted to the Central Committee for decision.</p>
<h3>The Northeast War Situation Will Soon Be Optimistic; Deng Wenyi Talks About the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th - Director Deng Wenyi discussed the current situation in the Northeast at the Government Information Office press conference this afternoon:</p>
<p>Motivation for the Offensive: Since the Northeast Lin Biao bandit forces' fifth offensive in July was crushed in the main battle of Siping Street, although they have actively replenished their forces in the past two months, they have not yet reached the strength to launch another offensive. However, there are four reasons why they recently launched a sudden offensive: First, to respond to the failure in Jiaodong within the customs and to cover up international views; second, to seize the opportunity to grab food; third, to launch the war in the Northeast before the national army advances into North China to reduce the pressure on the two provinces of Shanxi and Hebei; and fourth, to carry out a war of attrition before the national army's massive reinforcements and supplies are deployed to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Strength of the Bandit Army: Although the area occupied by the communist bandits in the Northeast is larger than the area recovered by the national army, they are all sparsely populated areas and it is difficult to recruit and replenish their forces. Their current strength, in addition to the eight columns formally organized by the Chinese Communist Party (each column is equivalent to a military unit), also includes 145,000 Korean communists, 35,000 Mongolian communists, and 15,000 Japanese communists, for a total strength of 440,000 people. Currently, the Korean communists are located east of the Middle East Railway, but they have not yet launched an offensive. The 27th column of the Chinese Communist Party has already taken action on the far western border. To the east are the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns, plus the new 8th column in Yingkou, southern Liaoning, and the 8th and 9th columns in Rehe and Jinxi, totaling more than 200,000 people.</p>
<p>Current Actions: The bandits, aware of the thorough success of the national army's strategy of attacking Shandong and the Jiaodong Peninsula, cutting off their lifeline of communication between inside and outside the customs, have also followed this strategy after a disastrous defeat, first by destroying transportation and cutting off the national army's supply line. They began launching attacks in late September, attacking between Yuguan and Jinzhou, attempting to destroy the railway transportation between inside and outside the customs. They first launched attacks in Wanjiatun and Xingcheng to cut off the Ping-Zheng Railway, and then launched offensives directly towards the railway line in Baiqibao, Raoyanghe, Kaiyuan, and Changtu. However, they do not know that the national army's communication between inside and outside the customs is not only the Beining and Middle East Railways on land, but also the air and sea supply, which cannot be compared with the bandits' Jiaodong Peninsula inside the customs and the Liaodong Peninsula outside the customs. Secondly, they want to isolate Changchun, Siping Street, Kaiyuan, Tieling, Shenyang, Liaoyang, and Anshan on the Middle East Railway line. Therefore, the 2nd and 7th columns west of the railway attacked Fakuchangtu, while the main force of the 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns attacked Xifeng, Bamiancheng, and Kaiyuan. The 6th column even turned towards the southeast of Changchun to harass, while the 4th column attacked and harassed east of Tieling, and the 8th column launched an attack from southern Liaoning. On the one hand, they destroyed transportation, and on the other hand, they tried to attack the field army of the national army. The national army has a predetermined plan for this kind of act and the deployment is already in place. Unexpectedly, the offensive has been frustrated, and the national army is fighting back against the bandits in all aspects.</p>
<p>Future Prospects: Judging from the bandits' background and situation in the Northeast today, both sides are still in a state before the main decisive battle, and the war is still developing. It is too early to judge the outcome of the battle, but from the perspective of the national army's morale of recovering territory for the country and maintaining the survival of the nation, although the bandits rely on constant reinforcements, and we cannot underestimate their strength, they have lost the sympathy of the people of the Northeast. In addition, the national army has strong morale and a firm determination and confidence in defending the territory and protecting the people. The future of the war in the Northeast will soon be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Movements of the Communist Army Within the Customs</h3>
<p>Analysis of the movements of the Communist army within the customs in the past week:</p>
<p>Chen Yi's bandit forces' actions can be divided into four regions for explanation: Jiaodong, western Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu: The 9th and 13th columns of the Jiaodong bandit army, because the national army captured Yantai and Muping, went straight to Wendeng and Weihaiwei, and were in great danger of being annihilated by the sea. Therefore, its 9th column and a small part of the 13th column fled westward to survive, attempting to join the remnants of the 2nd and 7th columns who were trapped northwest of Zhucheng between Weihe and Gaomi. The remaining bandits of the 13th column have retreated to the area south of Weihaiwei. Currently, our navy and army are cooperating and have entered Weihaiwei and Rongcheng Bay. If the bandits fight desperately, they may be completely annihilated by us. The remaining bandits of the column were originally composed of local troops, and their combat power is extremely weak. They only lurk and move at night, and only serve to contain the national army and maintain the connection between the north and south of the Yellow River. The communist army in northern Jiangsu has no great strength. Whenever the national army is mobilized, they take the opportunity to sneak attacks on towns and villages, looting houses to seize supplies and recruit soldiers as a negative action. The bandit army in the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu is the main force of Chen Yi's bandit army after its defeat in western Shandong. The bandit originally crossed the Dongyue Railway and infiltrated Lianghuai, but with only 10,000 people, it besieged Suxian, which was firmly guarded by only one battalion of the national army, and was still repelled after more than two days. It can be seen that its combat power has been greatly reduced after the battles of Juye, Chengwu, and Cao County in western Shandong, and it cannot engage in a main battle with the national army. At the same time, seeing that there is a strong national army force pressing southward in the Suqian Qiaoning area, if it crosses the Dongyue Railway, it will inevitably be forced into the area between the Shuanggou, Suining, and Huaihe areas, restricted between two lakes and two national armies, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, it painfully abandoned this best strategy and transferred the remnants of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns westward from Mengcheng and Guoyang, and the remnants of the 1st, 8th, and 12th columns fled south of Fugou to seek to avoid being encircled and annihilated by the national army, reduce the difficulties of Liu Bocheng's army, and want to merge. However, this attempt has not yet been fully realized.</p>
<p>As for Liu Bocheng's bandit army, in the past week, the national army encircled and attacked the remnants of its 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns near Baique Garden. After days of hard fighting, with about six or seven thousand casualties, they finally broke through and fled to the southeast on the 3rd of this month, in a very embarrassing state. Recently, they have been forced to collapse to the Huang'an Macheng area, with little remaining. The remnants of the 3rd column, who were originally entrenched in the Gushi Sanhe Jia area, fled to Lihuang after the disastrous defeat in Jingshang, and then entered the Dabie Mountains. However, because the national army had already controlled the mountain city, the bandit's dream of rebuilding a mountain base area was temporarily unrealizable. Moreover, since the national army implemented a luring strategy from Guangshan, Huangchuan, and Shangcheng with superior forces, Liu Fei's 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns could not join its 3rd column remnants in the northeast, and could not coordinate operations with Chen Yi's bandit forces. His attempt is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Fan Qihua's army of Chen Geng's bandit army entered the Funiu Mountains because the national army advanced eastward from Tongguan and exerted pressure on it with powerful troops from Shangnan and Shangcheng. This was a passive rather than a planned action. As for Han Shi's bandit army's 4th and 9th columns, they have been attacked by the national army near Hancheng Town, northeast of Luoning, for several days. They have suffered six or seven thousand casualties, and they cannot retreat or advance. They are in extreme difficulty and had to transfer the bandit 26th Brigade, which had sneaked east to Yiyang, back to rescue. The main battle against the national army at Mingbi Town can be the prelude to the bandit's collapse.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 8th] The deteriorating situation in the local financial market continues to worsen.

Initially, the bailiffs guarded the door and refused entry, but then the side door was forced open and people poured in, leaving almost no space upstairs and downstairs. The judge's seat was also occupied, and chairs and railings were crushed. The old building creaked and groaned. If the people upstairs had not poured down, a tragedy would have almost occurred. The court temporarily announced the postponement. Jin Bihui was brought in at around 1 PM and was discovered and surrounded. Jin had short hair, wore a white top and green suit pants, and her face was red as if she was happy, not like someone in prison. She frequently nodded to acquaintances to signal her greetings. After the decision to postpone was made at around 2 PM, she was sent back to prison by the guard. Jin jumped into the car, and before leaving, she gave a private letter to a certain acquaintance.</p>

<h3>Statement from the Director of the Bureau of Supplies: Procurement of Cars, Refrigerators, etc., Absolutely Within Scope</h3>
<p>[City News] Rumors have been circulating that the Bureau of Supplies successively purchased cars and refrigerators without completing customs declarations and inspections for import procedures, and that five Austin vehicles were priced for sale immediately after their arrival, exceeding the scope of their authority. Director Jiang Shao has stated the following: (1) The five Austin vehicles belonged to the former British troops stationed in India, who had borrowed five Jeeps from our government. Due to long-term wear and tear, they could not be returned. The British military in Calcutta allocated five old military Austin vehicles to our country as compensation. The Materials Reception Committee of the former Ministry of Economic Affairs transported them to Shanghai, arriving on September 6, 1946. At that time, based on general customs procedures for materials received from India, it was permissible to first provide a letter of guarantee and later complete the procedures. Indeed, customs were not declared at the time. However, after the bureau took over the Shanghai office's business, it collected evidence for customs declaration and submitted supplementary declaration under customs declaration number 3620. (2) Four Ford cars and one old Cadillac car arrived in Shanghai on February 28 of this year. The bureau declared customs under customs declaration number 495 and had import permits from the Import Management Committee (GOMC 64, 64). Apart from the Cadillac, which was transported on behalf of former President Song, the remaining four Ford cars were approved by the Executive Yuan for the bureau to retain for use and have not been sold to date. (3) The three refrigerators were entrusted by the China Merchants Bureau in June of last year. Since the bureau had previously purchased ships from Canada for the China Merchants Bureau without refrigeration equipment, they were purchased on their behalf. The import date was November 7 of last year, before the government's explicit prohibition on imports.</p>

<h3>On the Current Form of Military Suppression of the Rebellion</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Guangyan</p>
<p>The military suppression of bandits has recently been actively developed. With the dedication of the National Army soldiers, the communist bandits in Shandong have been wiped out and recovered by the National Army. This is indeed a major achievement in the military suppression of the rebellion, and its significance is even greater than the recovery of Yan'an and Zhangjiakou. However, after suffering this major blow, the communist bandits have adopted a policy of fleeing around, harassing everywhere. During this autumn harvest season, not only are materials plundered, but the people are also subjected to the tragedy of killing and fighting. A few people who do not understand the truth, seeing the communist bandits spreading to such a vast area in a short period of time, may lightly believe the rumors made by the communist bandits themselves, thinking that their strength is quite large. This article will briefly discuss the actual situation and the communist bandits' attempts, so as to correct the readers who are concerned about the current situation.</p>
<p>First, let us examine the current military situation: The recent movements of the communist bandits that deserve our attention can be divided into the following points: 1. Chen Geng's troops are entrenched in the Funiu Mountains, with the intention of advancing westward or southward. 2. The remnants of the communist bandits in Shandong have not been cleared, especially the remnants in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Bay, who are still reorganizing. 3. Chen Yi's bandit troops are fleeing southward, with a tendency to join forces with Liu Bocheng. 4. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are coercing people on a large scale, seemingly with ulterior motives. These are all things that people concerned about the military situation of suppressing the rebellion are paying attention to. However, if we review the actual situation, we will know that the various actions of the communist bandits are nothing more than posing and exaggerating their strength. For example, Chen Geng's bandit troops are still lurking in the Funiu Mountains, proving that they dare not leave the Yellow River line. Although they have cut off the Longhai Line, they are constantly guarded by the surrounding National Army. If they go deep to the west or south, they will not be able to flee back in the event of an emergency, resulting in repeating the mistakes of Li Xiannian. For example, in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Sea in Shandong, although the remnants are still posing, the certain columns that remain are all composed of militias and do not have much combat effectiveness. The bandits in other parts of Shandong are currently posing as strongly attacking Weixian; however, those who understand the bandit situation know that they dream of returning to the Yimeng Mountains. Not to mention that the National Army is constantly monitoring and will never let them succeed, and the food reserves in the Yimeng Mountains are all under the control of the National Army. Even if the bandits enter the mountainous area, they will not be able to find food. As for the recovery of Yantai and Weihaiwei, although the communist bandits boasted that there are still ports on the Yellow River that can be used for their north-south transportation; however, the ports on the north bank of the Yellow River that can be used by the bandits are small in scale and can only accommodate small sailing ships. Compared with Yantai and Weihaiwei, which can accommodate huge warships, the difference in value cannot be measured in miles. Secondly, regarding Chen Yi's southward flight. It is rumored that Chen Yi's bandit troops have joined forces with Liu Bocheng's bandit troops; however, there is actually a certain distance. Moreover, Liu's and Chen's bandit troops have very different strategic styles. Although we cannot list them in detail, we can point out that it is not easy for the two bandit troops of Chen and Liu to join forces. Finally, there is Liu Bocheng's troops. Liu's bandits were the first to flee south, which caused panic among the people in the rear; however, Liu's troops have been reduced from 80,000 to more than 20,000 after running for several months, and because they travel more than a hundred miles a day, their physical strength is exhausted, and the treatment of officers and soldiers is very different, resulting in a very depressed morale. Recently, Liu's bandits have only used Jingfu County as the center to harass the surrounding areas, without much major intention. It is said that Liu's bandits will flee into the Dabie Mountains as a base, which may be possible; however, the National Army has already seen through his treachery and will definitely be able to block and suppress it.</p>
<p>Second, let us look at the communist bandits' intention in this kind of fleeing policy: - For the sake of clarity, it can be explained in the following points: 1. The communist bandits' goal is to create refugees. In order to increase the difficulties for our government, the communist bandits have long decided to create refugees in large numbers, and this was used as a slogan when the communist bandits moved in the Cangxian area of ​​North China in July. Wherever Liu Bocheng's troops go this time, they rob everything and burn down the houses, forcing the people to leave, which is undoubtedly a continuation of the refugee creation policy. 2. The communist bandits' goal is to create chaos and riots in the rear to obstruct our military operations. After the communist bandits were heavily attacked by our military, they knew that their strength was far from enough to compete with us, so they turned to various cities in our rear to incite riots. In order to prepare for the implementation of this work, we must first shake people's hearts; and today, the best way to shake people's hearts is to destroy construction, obstruct transportation, and create economic panic. Based on this strategy, wherever Liu Bocheng went, he did his best to destroy factories and mines, and cut off railways. The recent soaring prices are directly affected by this. 3. The initial intentions of the communist bandits Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng to cross the river to the south or invade the east were to support Chen Yi's troops and maintain the Shandong Military Region's territory, especially the supply lifeline in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Sea. However, this plan has now become a bubble, so they do not hesitate to flee around in order to vent their anger at being severely attacked and to take this opportunity to open up another way to survive, which is the so-called "a way out of no way."</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, we feel that the current military suppression of the rebellion can be optimistic. From the mainland point of view, it can be said that the first phase of the work of suppressing bandits has been completed. As for the important tasks in the future, in addition to military pursuit, so as not to let the embers reignite, the focus should still be placed on politics and economy. As long as the government can rectify officialdom and strengthen grassroots politics, the communist bandits will never be able to flee around as before. As long as the government accelerates production, saves expenses, and gradually improves the lives of the general public economically, the communist bandits will be abandoned by the people, even if they coerce them by force.</p>
<p>The above is in terms of the general situation in the mainland. As for the war situation in the Northeast, the communist bandits have gathered a larger force than before this time to attack the National Army, and its momentum is very fierce. However, the National Army has gathered a strong main force in Shenyang; and the reinforcement and supply are more complete than in previous times. Even in terms of the cold-proof equipment for soldiers, the situation of the National Army is far better than that of the bandit troops. Therefore, although the continued fighting time of the communist bandits in the Northeast may be longer than in previous times, their final collapse is still beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In summary, the overall military suppression of bandits can be optimistic. What we are now focusing on is: on the government's side: how to rectify officialdom, stabilize prices, and strengthen the general mobilization, launching a large number of grassroots cadres to the front, so that everything can cooperate with the military. On the people's side: how to contribute their strength and materials to help the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. (October 7)</p>

<h3>US and Soviet Union Coordinate on Greek Issue, United Nations General Assembly Shows True Colors, Debate in Political Committee Nearing Final Stage, Poland Advocates Direct Discussion of Palestine Partition</h3>
<p>[Report] New York, 8th Broadcasting: Lake Success News, the Polish representative today urged the United Nations General Assembly to abandon all other proposals for resolving the Palestine issue and focus all its efforts on partitioning the land to establish Jewish and Arab states. The Polish representative also advocated allowing 250,000 European Jewish refugees to immigrate to Palestine. This method is strongly opposed by the Arab countries.</p>
<p>[Report] New York, 8th Broadcasting: Lake Success News, the Polish representative's speech at the UN General Assembly today for the first time showed that the Soviet bloc may reject the Arab demands and support the partition of the Holy Land. The Polish representative said that in view of the inability of the Arab and Jewish peoples to cooperate, partition is probably the only solution, although this method was not originally favored by Poland. But Poland still hopes that the Holy Land can still be a self-contained economic unit, and the partitioned countries should strive for cooperation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's 57-nation Political Committee, after debating the Balkan issue, has created the most chaotic state in the history of the United Nations, and the possibility of compromise between the US and Soviet solutions to the Balkan dispute has clearly been lost, and the day of reckoning is approaching. Some representatives believe that the Political Committee will put it to a vote before the weekend and immediately submit it to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 8th] After three weeks of eloquent accusations, the United Nations General Assembly has reached its climax on the 8th, and the two major proposals for Greece and Palestine have finally revealed their true colors. It is expected that regarding Palestine, the Soviet bloc will reject the Arab demand for the control of Palestine in the committee today and support the general principle of dividing the Holy Land into two states, Jewish and Arab. The long-awaited US policy statement on Greece may be revealed on the 9th or 10th. The general debate has ended, and the Political Committee has also begun to examine half a dozen or more proposals. In the last minute, small countries and countries in the middle of the US and Soviet Union, opposing the US-Soviet showdown, may cause the United States to demand that the General Assembly condemn the aggression of the three countries of South, Bulgaria, and Albania and blame the Greek situation on the efforts of the three countries, and all its efforts will be in vain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] When the UN Political Committee debated the Greek issue yesterday, the Yugoslav representative Bebler pointed out that the UK disregarded the Allied agreement in Greece, which immediately aroused the rebuttal of the British representative McNeil, accusing him of not using insulting words, and said, "I believe that after his neurosis recovers, he will definitely apologize." Swedish representative Unden proposed a compromise, not intending to blame anyone, and requested Greece and its neighbors to restore normal relations. Greek representative Melas denied that Greece was preparing for war, and he requested the United Nations to protect Greece, and the debate was immediately adjourned.</p>
<h3>Security Council Continues to Debate Indonesian Issue, Dutch Representative Surrounded on All Sides, Jiang Tingfu Refutes Klippens' Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] When the United Nations Security Council resumed its debate on the Indonesian issue on the 7th, the Dutch representative Klippens' speech aroused severe criticism from several countries, including China. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu led the offensive against the Dutch representative, saying: Klippens spoke too much, but weakened his position.</p>
<p>He mentioned various atrocities, but then jumped to his conclusion, saying that the entire Indonesian regime should be condemned. It must be known that the leaders of the Republic feel no less regret than we do for the atrocities. Although we are legally responsible for the Indonesian leaders, there is a distinction between them and they should not be generalized. Recently, there have been rumors from the outside world that the Netherlands intends to no longer recognize the current leaders of Indonesia. This move will be a strong motivation to continue Indonesian resistance. Jiang immediately requested the Security Council to fully support the Three-Country Mediation Committee and task the committee to start work immediately.</p>
<p>Indian and Polish Representatives Support Soviet Proposal</p>
<p>Indonesian representative Bila urged the Security Council to order both sides to withdraw to their positions before the conflict occurred. Bila also condemned the tone and substance of the Dutch representative's speech, believing that he had not paid sufficient attention to the necessary conditions for a peaceful solution. He pointed out that it was disappointing that the Dutch representative failed to explain how his government was prepared to implement the ceasefire order. Polish representative Kaczorowski supported the Soviet proposal, requesting the Security Council to order both sides to withdraw to the defense lines before the conflict, and he also pointed out that the main failure of the Security Council was its failure to treat both sides equally.</p>
<p>Indonesian Representative Requests Swift Action</p>
<p>Indonesian representative Bala said that when the Dutch army stopped advancing, it immediately drew an imaginary line, and began military action on towns and villages that unfortunately fell behind the line. Therefore, it is already very clear that the Dutch army has not respected the ceasefire order in its literal and spiritual sense. Bala put forward the following points: 1. Indonesia welcomes the Three-Country Mediation Committee, 2. Indonesia hopes that the United Nations can guarantee that its solutions are binding on both sides, 3. Indonesia requests swift action to prevent destruction and death; 4. The Three-Country Committee should work outside the Dutch and Indonesian areas to prevent direct influence.</p>
<p>The United States is Expected to Oppose the Demand for Both Sides to Withdraw</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] It is reported that the US will oppose the Soviet Union's request that the Dutch army withdraw to the area of ​​July 20 before the Three-Country Committee begins to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in a "mediation" manner in the Security Council. It is reported that the US intends to recommend that the Three-Country Committee immediately assist both sides of the Dutch and Indonesian sides, hoping to obtain a method to resolve the dispute from this.</p>
<h3>Captured Dutch Soldiers Have Been Released</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 7th] Three Dutch soldiers, who were captured by the Indonesian army because the American plane they were on was forced to land, have now been released by order of Yogyakarta and flew back to the Dutch-controlled area on an American plane.</p>
<h3>I Support India's Proposal on the Issue of Southwest Africa's Trusteeship</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The dispute between India and South Africa over the difficult issue of Southwest Africa caused a heated debate at the meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee on the 7th, and China expressed its support for India's position. India's proposal last week was discussed in the Trusteeship Committee today. India advocated that the General Assembly should decide on a deadline, ordering South Africa to submit a proposal to place Southwest Africa under trusteeship. South Africa refuted that South Africa has "no legal obligation to place the mandated territory under trusteeship", and the Netherlands supported South Africa. Denmark put forward a proposal to support South Africa and set up a fact-finding group. Chinese representative Liu Chuo made a major objection to the Danish proposal, saying, "If the Danish proposal can be passed, what is the connection between the information obtained by this group and the United Nations' plan?" This group will achieve nothing, "but it can cover up the fact that there is no decision on the trusteeship of Southwest Africa, and it can avoid the topic and create a situation that violates the Charter."</p>
<h3>Muslim Youths, Ready to Fight for Palestine</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The president of the Muslim Brotherhood, Banja, sent a telegram to Azam, the secretary-general of the Arab League, telling him that 10,000 Muslim youths are ready to fight for Palestine. He said that this is the first division of the Muslim army, and he believes that fighting is the only way to save Palestine.</p>
<h3>US's New Proposal on the Korean Issue May Be Submitted to the General Assembly Tomorrow, Hodge Advises Koreans to Remain Calm</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] According to authoritative sources, the United States hopes to submit its motion on the Korean issue to the United Nations Political Committee on the 9th (Friday). In the motion, the United States advocates the establishment of a United Nations committee to monitor the South Korean elections and the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. The United States will welcome the Soviet Union's proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from the two countries, but will suggest that the United Nations say that there are still many issues that are best handled by the United Nations Committee. The United States will suggest that the US and the Soviet Union should not have representatives on this committee.</p>
<p>Previously, it was generally discussed that the United States would suggest that the Allied countries provide economic assistance to South Korea, but the United States will not mention this point in the motion, but will suggest that an agency should be established at the request of South Korea to cooperate with the organization that investigates the withdrawal of troops. The most senior officials in the United States firmly denied the rumors that the United States intended to suggest that the United Nations take over the trusteeship of South Korea. They said that this statement is completely contrary to the opinions of the US delegation at this time. The US delegation met on the 7th, and Marshall personally attended and immediately decided to submit the US proposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 8th] General Hodge issued a statement today, saying that regarding the Korean issue, because of the shelving of the US-Soviet Joint Committee, the United States submitted it to the General Assembly for discussion. Korean people requested to send representatives to participate in the United Nations conference. The US side did not know anything about it beforehand, and the US side did not appoint anyone to serve as a Korean representative. I have no right to elect a Korean representative. Regarding the Korean general election, because the United Nations is now waiting to discuss the Korean issue, and its results are still unpredictable, holding a general election now will lead to more difficulties. If the Korean people support the United Nations to resolve the Korean issue, they should be more calm and patient in order to smoothly resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>US Gains Preliminary Victory in Washing Away Accusation of War-Mongering</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United States gained a preliminary victory in the United Nations on the 7th in opposing the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is a war-monger. Mrs. Roosevelt directed the operation in the Social Committee. The committee finally rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to restrict the freedom of the press to curb war-mongers by a vote of 34 to 6. Eight countries abstained.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Reviews Soviet New Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Now that the Comintern has been established, how will the Kremlin complete its new policy? According to New York Times political reporter C. L. Sulzberger, Moscow leaders are expected to adopt the following strategies in various processes: To sign bilateral military alliances with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Albania, while standardizing military equipment and technology. The Soviet Union has already signed such agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. If the Communist Party gains control in Greece, Austria, or Italy, the Soviet Union will enter into similar agreements with those countries or traitors. Continue propaganda, while possibly providing other support to Greek rebels. Promote the most powerful Communist Party organizations in France and Italy. Delay the stalemate in peace treaty negotiations with Germany and Austria. Regarding Soviet activities outside of Europe, Sulzberger further observed: Soviet propaganda in the Middle East will be strengthened, but achievements will vary. The Soviet Union will maintain its position of dominance over the United States in Korea; in Outer Mongolia, Soviet influence is already above all else. Sulzberger received the Overseas Press Club of America award in 1941 for his outstanding reporting on the Soviet-German war. Sulzberger stated that it is believed that Moscow is not only paying attention to the tin and gold of the outside world, but also to the granting of base rights for passages to India (such as those obtained when China and the Soviet Union jointly controlled Xinjiang). Sulzberger stated that one of the reasons for this move by the Soviet Union is that the Communist Party firmly believes that non-Communist countries will fall into a dangerous period of depression within a few years; another reason is the orthodox doctrine of the Communist Party, that the war between capitalism and communism is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Visits Truman Advocates for Speedy Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan and Reveals Principles Already Drafted by the Far Eastern Commission</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] Australian Foreign Minister Herbert Vere Evatt, while meeting with President Truman today, emphasized the urgent need for a peace treaty with Japan. After a half-hour meeting with the President, Evatt stated: Australia welcomes the United States' proposal to convene a peace conference. He explained: The major powers have reached a unanimous agreement on the initial actions of the Far Eastern Commission, but he declined to predict when the conference would be held. He stated: He had recently traveled in Japan and found that MacArthur was doing an "excellent job" in handling the occupation. He revealed: The Far Eastern Commission has drafted principles for resolving the Far Eastern issues, and commented that this solution should be simpler than the solution to the European problem. When asked about the possible impact of the new European Comintern on the Far East, he declined to answer, but stated that the announcement of this new organization was "merely a symptom."</p>
<h3>Conference to Handle Issues of Italian Territories Nineteen Countries Including China Granted Speaking Rights</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers resolved today to allow nineteen countries, including China, to express their opinions on the issue of Italy's former colonies. These are countries that signed the peace treaty with Italy, such as Pakistan, which was established after the peace treaty was signed, as well as Egypt and Italy, which have territorial claims on Italy's former colonies. However, whether the aforementioned relevant countries may also express opinions on the procedures adopted by the four-power investigative committee to conduct on-the-spot surveys of public opinion in the former Italian territories has not yet been agreed upon by the four powers. According to a spokesman for the Italian Embassy in London today, the Italian government will soon submit a memorandum to the four-power conference, stating Italy's attitude and emphasizing political and economic reasons to request permission for Italy to participate in the administration of its former African colonies. If Italy is allowed to govern its former colonies under UN trusteeship, it would not only satisfy the aspirations of the Italian government but also greatly help solve the unemployment problem of tens of thousands of Italian workers.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the New Comintern, the French and Italian Communist Parties Face Difficulties The US State Department Purges Unstable Elements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] It is generally believed here that after the establishment of the new Comintern, the French and Italian Communist Parties are at a great disadvantage. Outside the Iron Curtain, only the French and Italian Communist Parties participate in this organization. This clearly indicates that the French and Italian governments will be the first targets of the new Comintern. The Communist Party has also obviously ruined its own future and will no longer be able to participate in the French and Italian governments or form coalition cabinets. The acquisition of key cabinet seats has traditionally been the Communist Party's way of "legally" seizing power.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] Italian Communist Party leader Longo stated: The organization of the Communist front indicates the sharpness and imminence of the danger of war. The organizational meeting of the Information Bureau is limited to Southern, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Italy, and the Soviet Union, because these countries are now most threatened by the imperialism that takes aggressive actions, and therefore these countries are most capable of resisting its attacks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] British Communist Party Secretary-General Pollitt issued a statement welcoming the establishment of the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] The U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes stated: Nozaki, the second leader of the Japanese Communist Party, denied that the Japanese Communist Party is related to the new Comintern. He stated that this is a European issue and has nothing to do with the Japanese Communist Party, and that the Japanese Communist Party will not have any contact with it in the future. Nozaki stated that the Japanese Communist Party will issue a formal statement after obtaining more accurate information.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The State Department announced today that in order to prevent spies from spying on State Department secrets, it has ordered the Personnel Department to investigate the identities of all civil servants. Those who are members of the Communist Party, Nazi Party, or Fascist Party, or who have dealings with these parties, should be reported to Secretary of State Marshall for dismissal. So far, nine people have been dismissed, three have resigned voluntarily, and an unannounced number have been granted permission to resign. Those who are dismissed will never be rehired.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Prime Minister Attlee recently announced the reorganization of the Labor government's lineup, bringing younger figures into the cabinet to strengthen its ability to cope with the economic crisis.

<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 8th Broadcast: The British public's reaction to the large-scale reorganization of the cabinet and the demotion of left-wing Fuel Minister Shinwell is mixed, with some welcoming it and others expressing dissatisfaction.

<h3>Cripps Talks About Emergency Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: British Economic Minister Cripps gave a speech to reporters today, stating that the British government's emergency economic measures must be thoroughly implemented, otherwise Britain will be in dire straits. Currently, our country has begun to use gold and dollar reserves, and the amount of these reserves is not very large. Once they are exhausted, it will affect the entire gold pound zone. Therefore, Britain has to reduce imports and increase domestic production, using the method of lowering the standard of living to overcome the difficulties, but this method is not enough to solve the economic problems of the entire world. The general lack of dollars makes international trade impossible to develop, which is something that our country alone cannot do.</p>

<h3>Step Up! Step Up! Curb the Market Upsurge Mayor Reports Causes and Countermeasures A Large Number of Economic Police Officers are Mobilized Today Suggestions for Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, prices in this city have risen again, and the black markets for gold, banknotes, cotton yarn, and US dollars have become even more rampant. The city government held an economic inspection meeting at 11:00 yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. At 4:45 p.m., Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the city government conference room to report the resolutions as follows: (1) Gold and banknotes: In order to accurately destroy the black market prices, in addition to intensifying inspections and audits, it was decided to strictly inspect the wireless telegrams from Hong Kong to Shanghai and strictly prohibit the private establishment of radio stations to avoid affecting black market fluctuations. As for the reason for the surge in the foreign exchange black market, it is because rumors spread in the market that the central government would allow the opening of self-provided foreign exchange purchases of goods, and citizens believed it to be true, resulting in mass absorption. Now the city government has decided to make two suggestions to the central government: Goods that have been imported without a permit that are not necessities must be ordered to return to their original place, but it is strictly forbidden to transport them to Hong Kong to prevent them from being smuggled to Shanghai. Goods that have been imported without a permit that are necessary for industry must be uniformly distributed to various factories by the government, stipulating the legal profit for intermediate merchants. The mayor had consulted with Executive Yuan President Zhang and Central Bank President Zhang on the above methods, and he firmly believes that the central government is very likely to adopt them. (2) Cotton prices: The fluctuation of gold banknotes and US dollars is actually caused by the upsurge in cotton yarn prices, so the city government is determined to suppress them. It has ordered the police bureau and the cotton regulation committee to thoroughly investigate the origin and whereabouts of the yarn stored in various factories in order to crack down on transactions of a "kick the ball" nature. Once discovered, they will be severely punished. (3) Rice: The rice currently allocated to workers and the poor in this city has been implemented. The city government has recently requested the central government to allocate more rice, which will be transported to Shanghai soon. Furthermore, in order to dredge the source of rice in this city, it has been requested to the central government to order the Ministry of Food to transfer the rice-producing areas to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible, and the price of rice will definitely stabilize. (4) Cooking oil: At present, there are still black markets and smuggling of cooking oil in this city. The city government has often requested the Executive Yuan to order the customs in Wenzhou and Ningbo to prohibit the transshipment of cooking oil to the south. Mayor Wu stated at the end: Starting from the 9th, a large number of economic police officers will be mobilized to earnestly implement the various points decided by the inspection meeting.</p>
<h3>Uniform Distribution and Sale of Cooking Oil, Limited Storage of Coal By the Kilo Two Methods Passed to be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city government's economic meeting yesterday passed two cases: the method for distributing and selling cooking oil to retail merchants of cooking oil proposed by the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, and the Provisional Measures for the Storage and Management of Coal by the Kilo in Shanghai. The outline of the method for distributing and selling cooking oil to retail merchants of cooking oil is as follows: In order to assist the government in stabilizing oil prices, this association will implement the distribution and sale of cooking oil to retail merchants in this city in accordance with the provisions of this method. All retail stores in this city that have been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, etc., and have obtained a business license, may register with this association to apply for distribution and sale. The quantity of cooking oil for distribution and sale shall be 1,200 market dans per day in principle, with members of this association responsible for 20,000 market dans per month. If the quantity is insufficient, the Central Trust Bureau shall allocate it from the storage of cooking oil from various factories that it has consigned. The quantity allocated to each retailer shall be determined based on the actual sales of its store. The type of cooking oil for distribution and sale shall be designated by each distributing factory. The price of each type of cooking oil shall be discussed and submitted by this meeting to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, and then notified to the offices of each factory daily for posting. After the quantity for distribution and sale is approved, this association will issue an oil distribution certificate with an official seal card, designate the oil factory for distribution and sale, arrange the dates in groups, and distribute and sell in rotation. The detailed implementation rules will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>The provisional measures for the storage and management of coal by the kilo are as follows: These measures are hereby formulated to prevent the hoarding and manipulation of coal by the kilo in Shanghai, which affects people's lives. The storage of coal by the kilo (including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and coke) in this city shall be governed by these measures, except as otherwise provided by the Measures for the Prohibition of Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Periods. The amount of coal stored by factories shall be limited to two months' consumption. The amount of coal stored by coal merchants shall be limited to one month's turnover (the average amount for each month in the first half of the 36th year shall be the standard), but those who purchase large quantities of coal from non-controlled mining areas may apply to the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Fuel Management Committee) for approval to increase the amount of storage. The storage of coal in coal yards by depositors shall be limited to one month. If the time limit is exceeded, those with a quantity of more than 100 tons must be approved by the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee. Except for coal dealers, coal yards, and those who truly need coal by the kilo, no coal by the kilo shall be stored. If there is any violation of these measures, such as storing coal by the kilo, or storing exceeding the limit, or storing in a coal yard exceeding the time limit without clearing it, and other provisions, and if it has not been reported to the Fuel Management Committee for approval in advance, the Fuel Management Committee shall purchase it at the allocation price. All coal by the kilo that is purchased due to violations of these measures shall be deducted by 30% of the purchase price and used as bonuses for investigators. If it is discovered due to a tip-off, the bonus shall be equally distributed between the tip-off and the handling personnel. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Shanghai Municipal Economic Inspection Meeting, and shall be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by the Fuel Management Committee for record.</p>

<h3>Complex Parole Procedures: Shanghai Prison Explains Reasons for Delayed Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] "Parole," "parole," how many family members of traitors hope for the realization of "parole." Suzhou Prison has already paroled thirteen people, and a second batch of forty-nine people has been approved. Why has Shanghai Prison been slow to implement it? To find the answer to this question, the reporter visited the Shanghai Prison authorities yesterday. According to them: Suzhou Prison started the work of examining traitors earlier, so parole was also earlier. Shanghai Prison is actively carrying out the work of parole, and the roster and assessment forms will be sent to the Ministry of Justice for review within a few days. The parole procedure is quite complicated. The outside world does not understand the truth, which has caused misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Traitors in prison must meet the following conditions before they can be paroled: ☐ They have served their sentence, ☐ They have evidence of genuine repentance, ☐ For life imprisonment, more than ten years have passed; for fixed-term imprisonment, more than one-half of the term has passed. The so-called life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment refer to the executed sentence, which is limited to the actual number of days spent in prison, and the number of days of detention is not counted. Therefore, there are not many traitors who meet the parole conditions. As for the investigation of genuine repentance, it is assessed by the prison's education section, work section, and guard section. The standards for assessing prisoners are: ☐ work, ☐ sense of responsibility and will, ☐ conduct. The scores are divided into four levels, and those who pass are promoted to the next level. According to the provisions of Articles 75 and 76 of the Prison Regulations, when they are promoted to the first and second levels, they have the hope of parole. The prison's progressive treatment review committee will review and approve them, and then the prison affairs committee will pass them. The warden will submit them directly to the Ministry of Justice for approval, and the parole work will be completed. Those who are paroled must be placed under probation according to Article 94 of the Criminal Law to prevent them from relapsing. The purpose of parole is to enable people to correct their mistakes and start anew. If they commit a crime and are sentenced during the parole period, their parole will be revoked, and the number of days they were released from prison will not be counted in the sentence.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Municipal Industrial Association: Discussing the Issue of Importing Goods Registered with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange. Decided to Ask the Chamber of Commerce to Lead the Effort to Secure Certificates and Open Up the Process Quickly.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Various industrial trade associations held an emergency meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss the application for government-issued certificates for importing goods registered with self-provided foreign exchange. The following resolutions were made: ☐ For industrial raw materials and production equipment purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that have already arrived in port or were shipped before the end of September, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should lead the relevant industrial trade associations to strive for the quick issuance of certificates and the opening up of the process in order to maintain production. ☐ Each industrial association should immediately notify its members that if they have goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange, they should quickly register with their respective associations so that they can be reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification. At the same time, the meeting also discussed how to promote the implementation of the legal reduction of the business tax for manufacturing by half. It was decided to continue to argue reasonably and to jointly submit a petition to the relevant authorities in the name of the various industrial associations to request the legal reduction of the tax by half. Representatives will be sent to Beijing to petition if necessary.</p>
<p>Sixteen Associations Including Import and Export Associations Invite People from All Walks of Life to Hold a Forum</p>
<p>[Our Report] The sixteen trade associations, including the Import and Export Commerce Association under the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held a forum at the International Hotel yesterday for the purpose of applying for certificates for the import of goods registered with self-provided foreign exchange. More than sixty people, including experts, scholars, and members of the press, were invited to attend and conduct a public review of the issue. Jing Wei chaired the meeting. Fan Heyan, Pan Shihao, Wu Chengming, Sheng Mujie, Pan Shijie, Ji Chaoding, and others spoke separately, expressing sympathy for the two requests made by the industry. The two points are as follows: ☐ For registered materials with self-provided foreign exchange that comply with the current trade control regulations and are items allowed for import, please issue permits as soon as possible so that they can be declared and imported early. Items that are prohibited from import should of course be prohibited. ☐ Extend the shipping deadline for ordered goods to the end of September, and allow manufacturers and importers to provide documents to complete the registration and release them.</p>
<h3>Luo Qinghua Writes to the Transportation Management Committee with Two Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Luo Qinghua, Standing Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, wrote to Zhang Gongquan, Chairman of the Transportation Management Committee, yesterday, requesting a quick solution to the issue of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange by various industries. He also discussed the Administrative Yuan's review meeting, which had suggested several processing principles, stating: ☐ Increase customs duties by 100% to serve as a fine. At a time when the national treasury is stretched, levying taxes through fines is a reasonable approach to increase revenue. ☐ Pay 50% of the value of the goods to the Central Bank as a deposit, which will be refunded in three installments within six months with an interest rate of 2%. This method aims to temporarily freeze part of the purchasing power, which is well-intentioned. However, in reality, the goods ordered by importers have been delayed for years. Under high interest rates, most of them have been mortgaged and borrowed again and again, with interest accruing on interest. Even if the goods are taken out for sale, there is no ideal superior profit beyond clearing debts. It is recommended to order the relevant industry associations of the Chamber of Commerce to supply the goods at a fair price within a certain period of time according to the registered types and quantities, and not to hoard and speculate. ☐ Thoroughly investigate the source of foreign exchange: Although this is a good idea, it belongs to the past. Instead of pursuing the past, it is better to strictly demand the future. Each importer should be required to provide a written guarantee stating that they will no longer engage in scalping foreign exchange or violating trade regulations, which is more practical and convenient. In addition, Luo also suggested: ☐ For materials shipped after August 16 and before the end of September that could not be stopped, it is proposed to uniformly complete the registration and handle them in the same way. ☐ For orders placed before November 17 last year that have valid documents and are verified to be true, even if they are not permitted import materials, they should also be completed for registration, and various situations should be considered to determine the processing method for different types of goods in order to resolve the pending cases.</p>

<h3>Married Woman Sues for Seduction and Loss of Virginity</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The District Court received a self-accusation from Zhang Weifeng, residing at No. 2, Haichangli, Gongxin Road yesterday. The defendant is named Xu Zilu, who was her former neighbor. In the first half of the year, the defendant used the excuse of asking Zhang to do needlework in his room, led her to a secret room in his house, and seduced her in every possible way. Soon after, the plaintiff's husband, Gu Yijin, found out and moved to Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, but Xu still frequently went to Gu's house to flirt when Gu Yijin was out, and eventually succeeded three times in a hotel. Xu Zilu, after getting his wish, became greedy and tricked her into living with him at his apprentice's house on Zhongshan West Road.

He also sent people to monitor her during the day to prevent her from going out, and even asked the plaintiff to falsely claim that she had been beaten by her husband and to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring a divorce.

<h3>The Glory of Shaoxing People! Standard "Lower River" People in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Chongqing 6th dispatch] People from the "Lower River" area who first come to Chongqing, this land and water transportation hub, few do not know Zheng Hongfu. This 47-year-old middle-aged man stepped into Sichuan province on August 1st, 1937. In just ten short years, he has become one of Chongqing's "celebrities" who occupies an important position.</p>
<p>When Zheng Hongfu was thirteen years old, he was an apprentice at the "Huichuntang" Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop in Cixi. At the age of nineteen, he went to Shanghai and worked as a junior clerk at the "Caitongde" Pharmacy on Henan Road.</p>
<p>A chance opportunity led him to work as an accountant at "Yipinxian" at the age of twenty-three. A friend from Hechuan, Mr. Yu Shaoqiao, invited him to help in the Sichuan Tax Bureau. As a result, near Jiudaomen on Linsen Road, he spent 570 yuan to acquire a shop.</p>
<p>The Hongfu Restaurant thus opened. It is said that Mr. Pan Gongzhan, who was with the Overseas Department and the Social Affairs Department at Jiudaomen at the time, often liked to eat a bowl of pork rib noodles at the Hongfu Restaurant.</p>
<p>He felt that killing living beings was never a good thing. Eventually, he returned to his original profession, inviting twenty friends to contribute capital, 50,000 yuan each, for a total of one million yuan, and transformed the Hongfu Restaurant into Chongqing Zhejiang Qingyutang Pharmacy. On the opening day, Chongqing newspapers carried a large advertisement for Qingyutang: "Preferential treatment for families of soldiers fighting the war, free medical consultations and medicine, without charging a cent, until the victory of the war." Even today, "Qingyutang" still provides free medical consultations and medicine, and patients can even specify the Chinese medicine doctor they trust to provide free consultations for them. On October 7, 1945, the Chongqing City</p>
<p>families of soldiers fighting the war held a ceremony at the Xin Yun Hui auditorium to present banners to General Chairman Jiang and others. Zhou Jingxiu, a representative of the families, specially presented Zheng Hongfu with a single banner because he "enjoys doing good deeds and has benefited the families of soldiers greatly." And "Vice Minister Dechun of the Ministry of Military Service specifically pointed out that Mr. Zheng Hongfu, manager of Zhejiang Qingyutang, has donated over ten million in medical expenses to the families of soldiers over the past eight years, which is admirable and respectable" (as recorded in the Xinshu Daily on October 7, 1945).</p>
<p>There was a period when he directly managed ten units of his own factories (including oil refineries, cigarette factories) and shops. And he was responsible for the management of no less than twenty or thirty. This</p>
<p>honest and simple businessman who started from scratch has a noble ideal: "Take from society, use for society." He believes that if one factory he runs can secure the livelihoods of five hundred employees, then ten factories would support five thousand? These five thousand could at least sustain over ten thousand family members. If every constituent of society could participate in productive enterprises, the city would be more prosperous and society would be more stable.</p>
<p>He has over a hundred letters of appointment, and the reporter carefully read each one. It can be said that</p>
<p>all are voluntary with no power. For example: finance committee member of the Raising People and Returning Home Assistance Association, director of the Chongqing branch of the World Red Swastika Society, director of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Lijiiao General Association. He even worries about the affairs of the dead and is also the chairman of the committee for relocating deceased fellow villagers. The reporter frankly said to Zheng Hongfu:</p>
<p>"Instead of helping one person, it is better to provide relief funds to help the majority; instead of scattered charitable undertakings, it is better to concentrate efforts on opening schools and developing culture."</p>
<p>He nodded and replied, "I am planning towards this step. I have now opened a Kaihua Free Primary School in Nan'an,</p>
<p>which does not charge a penny and already has over three hundred students attending. In addition, I have recently donated ten million yuan to the city's relief agency to raise funds to take in street refugees."</p>
<p>If people from the "Lower River" area have any difficulties in Chongqing, they can look to Zheng Hongfu for solutions. Currently, he is the chairman of the Zhejiang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing and also the chairman of the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing. The Shaoxing people, who are thousands of miles away, may not have thought that this young fellow villager has indeed done something for the "Lower River" people.

<h3>Suka Road Repair Awaits</h3>

<h3>Rectify Discipline, Prohibit Send-offs and Welcomes, Publishing Farewell Greetings in Newspapers. Close to Flattery. The Fujian Provincial Government Strictly Reprimands and Prohibits</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Fuzhou 8th dispatch] The financial staff of Changle County, Fujian, published a large advertisement in the Central Daily News in this city to bid farewell to the former financial chief, Qiu Hanping. The provincial government believes that in the midst of rectifying discipline, this act is close to flattery, and specially sent a telegram to reprimand it, and also instructed all counties and cities to prohibit it. In the future, if similar situations occur again, severe punishments will be imposed. Also: The custom of welcoming and sending off officials is very prevalent here. When a district chief takes office, some people even rent special cars to parade and celebrate with firecrackers, which is suspected of excessive flattery and is often strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen in Guangdong, Shouldering 35 Million Citizens</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Guangzhou 4th dispatch] The golden wind of the South China Sea comes late, a wave of heat in the City of Five Goats, directly into people's hearts.</p>
<p>Chairman Soong took office. At exactly ten o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, amidst a solemn military music in the grand Zhongshan Memorial Hall, Chairman Soong received this "big golden seal" from General Lo Cho-ying. In his speech, the previous Chairman Luo, who "came in brightness and left in brightness," said earnestly: "Today's handover ceremony is not just a handover of seals and official documents, but also a sincere handover of the province's more than 50,000 civil servants to the new person, not just the handover of more than 50,000 civil servants who serve faithfully, but more importantly, the handover of 35 million brothers and sisters to the new person." What will happen? This political figure, who has been away from his hometown for twenty years, with half of his hair gray, read a short speech in Shanghai dialect, illuminated by the lights in the auditorium. He promised two concerns: One is "I hope that in the near future, the people of Guangdong will be able to live and work in peace and contentment," and the other is "There will be no major changes in the provincial government personnel, and I hope all colleagues will work with peace of mind." The short twelve-minute report seemed to have revealed half of the mystery and stabilized half of the people's hearts, especially the "brothers, brothers" sandwiched in the smile, which made people feel a bit "unusual."</p>
<p>Chairman Soong has plans, has prestige, and has money. What is on Chairman Soong's mind is also the "economic crisis in Guangdong," "four beauties, two difficulties," the 35 million people in Guangdong should have a chance to breathe a sigh of relief. Autumn is deep, everyone is thinking: Will there be a spring in autumn? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>

<h3>Supervisor's Report Full Text (Continued)</h3>
<p>E. Recently, foreign merchants have been promoting that our government's trade policy discriminates against and oppresses them, but after investigating the facts, the opposite is true. Taking the quota allocation of five items such as automobiles, kerosene, tobacco, sugar, and movies as an example: Last winter, the automobile quota allocation for the largest number of imports was 45 automobile merchants, with a total import of 1,251 vehicles, totaling US$1,806,924.00. The American Ford Motor Company accounted for 382 vehicles, worth US$500,984.00; the American Lianhan Automobile Company accounted for 150 vehicles, worth US$195,934.00; the Madi Automobile Company accounted for 88 vehicles, worth US$133,827.00. These three companies accounted for half of the total amount. In total, the automobiles allocated to other foreign merchants accounted for more than two-thirds of the total quota. Taking the kerosene quota allocation as an example: Last winter, 22 merchants were allocated a total of 232,038,614 liters of oil, totaling US$6,907,901.00. Asia Petroleum Company accounted for 48,307,250 liters, worth US$2,387,682.00; Mobil Petroleum Company accounted for 41,544,160 liters, worth US$2,033,540.00; Texaco Petroleum Company accounted for 23,561,257 liters, worth US$1,003,662.00. These three companies accounted for more than 90% of the total amount. Taking the movie quota allocation as an example: Last winter, the total import of movies was 808,899 meters, totaling US$96,056.00. All of them belong to foreign merchants. The situation of the remaining two items, tobacco and sugar, is also the same (see Attachment 18). In addition, the import of other quota and non-quota commodities is based on certain standards and clearly stipulated. The facts are obvious. Chinese and foreign merchants are treated equally, and there will be no discrimination (see Attachment 19 for details).</p>
<p>F. Since November 17 last year, although all imported goods have been subject to prior review and import permits, which are the responsibility of the Provisional Import Management Committee, the Executive Yuan can directly issue import permits for certain items, notifying the Provisional Import Management Committee to issue import licenses. Some of the specially approved imports are necessary for national defense and special measures must be taken, but looking at the list of items from November 17 of this year to the end of May of this year (see Attachment 20), most of them are no different from general imported items, and there are various conflicts with laws and regulations in the specially approved automobile import item, which not only damages the government's legislative and law enforcement credibility, but also opens up opportunities for individuals to seek extra benefits. In the future, the Executive Yuan should be more cautious about the approval of specially approved imports.</p>
<p>G. In the past, the highest economic decision-making body of our government often included people who operated industrial and commercial enterprises, or participated in economic decision-making bodies, but took advantage of their special convenience to operate industrial and commercial enterprises. As a result, they cleverly seized and plundered, forming huge wealth. Therefore, domestic people regard them as bureaucratic capital, and others regard them as wealthy capital. Public opinion throughout the country believes that they should be cracked down on and eradicated. Recently, the government authorities have repeatedly issued orders to prohibit officials from engaging in commerce. The members of the recently established Economic Committee still inevitably include a few people who directly operate industrial and commercial enterprises. These people can provide certain conveniences to the committee in terms of the technical implementation of affairs, but in terms of the confidentiality of their decision-making, it is a great obstacle. For example, recently, the committee decided to change the official foreign exchange rate policy. It is widely rumored in Shanghai that some people have purchased US dollar short-term treasury bills in advance to obtain huge profits due to the convenience of news. Although there is no solid evidence, public opinion is formidable and is related to the government's credibility. It seems that it is necessary to carefully select the members of the committee again.</p>
<p>H. The capital of Fuzhong Company is entirely composed of investments from the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank. Not only is its business nature not for production and construction matters, but it also has the suspicion of using the name of its New York branch to evade taxes and hide profits, as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, Article 18 of the Bank of Communications' charter stipulates: "In addition to the various businesses listed in Article 17, the Bank of Communications shall not engage in the following items and other businesses." Item 4 stipulates that it shall not "directly engage in various industrial and commercial professions" (see Attachment 21). Also, Article 11 of the "Financial Management of Banks" amended and approved by the Executive Yuan at the 736th meeting in March 1946 stipulates: "Banks shall not be shareholders of shops or other banks or companies, but this shall not apply to investments in production and construction projects approved by the Ministry of Finance." Article 12 stipulates: "Banks shall not directly engage in industrial and commercial businesses..." The joint organization of Fuzhong Company by the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank is a clear violation of the above two laws and regulations. Now the business situation of Fuzhong Company is not for production purposes, but purely for import and export trade, which only gives Chinese and foreign people a bad impression. It is necessary to deal with the company in accordance with the law, and the Ministry of Finance should separately discuss the violations of the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank.</p>
<p>I. Song Ziliang, the general manager of Fuzhong Company, Shen Henian, the associate manager, and Song Zi'an, the general manager of China Construction Bank, all went abroad as government officials at the time, each with a special diplomatic passport. Now, their original employing agencies have separately verified that they no longer have official status (see Attachment 17), but they still have diplomatic passports and continue to reside abroad. At the same time, they hold positions as general managers or deputy general managers of major companies. Whether they are engaged in commercial activities in the United States, as reported by foreign newspapers, the fact that they are current businessmen holding diplomatic passports and staying abroad will inevitably lead to criticism and accusations of taking advantage of special privileges. The above-mentioned diplomatic passports should be revoked to avoid criticism. In the future, the government authorities should be cautious about issuing diplomatic and official passports, and should separately investigate those who currently hold diplomatic and official passports but have not returned to the country to see if there are similar situations and deal with them in accordance with the law to maintain international reputation.</p>
<p>J. Since the implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on February 17 of this year, the government has strictly restricted imported goods, whether they are settled in foreign exchange or not. On August 18, it further announced that all goods with self-provided foreign exchange would be temporarily suspended from issuing import licenses. However, according to Shanghai newspapers, the goods that Chinese and foreign merchants have already transported to Shanghai but have not been approved for import amount to more than US$100 million (according to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance, worth US$40 million). These goods include newspapers, lead sheets, unnamed machines, fertilizers, medicines, automobiles, and other materials. The import of these materials was not approved by the government in advance. After arriving in Shanghai, they were either placed in customs warehouses or scattered on the docks. According to the on-site inspection by the committee members, there are no less than 500 to 600 cars of various colors scattered in the Gonghexin Dock and other places. According to customs regulations, if an import license cannot be obtained within half a month, a fine will be imposed. After two months, it will be confiscated. If this situation is not properly handled for a long time, it will either be damaged or flow into smuggling. This is a loss to both individuals and the government. The authorities should decide on a proper handling method as soon as possible to avoid corruption. The above report is respectfully submitted to President Yu, Supervisors He Hanwen, Wang Guanwu, Du Guangxun, and Gu Fengxiang, Auditor Wan Rongbin of the Audit Department, and Assistant Auditor Chen Huayuan, October 1.

<h3>Lin Yimin Agrees with the No-Study-Abroad Plan, To Achieve "Academic Independence"</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's dispatch) Lin Yimin, the president of National Chung Cheng University, previously raised funds for the school's hypothetical foundation and hired professors to come to Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, he left Shanghai with his family by car and transferred to Hangzhou to Jiangxi. When interviewed by reporters at the North Station, Lin expressed his opinion on President Hu of Peking University's ten-year education plan, saying: "University education should seek balanced development. Young people everywhere have the right to demand that the government build their local universities into excellent educational institutions. The government should do its best to support universities with a short history and poor equipment, so that they can catch up with universities with a long history and good equipment, and then seek the overall development of each school." Lin believes that if this goal is to be achieved, the fundamental solution is to increase education funding. He strongly agrees with Hu's no-study-abroad plan, using a large amount of foreign exchange to hire scholars from various countries to teach in China, which can still achieve "academic independence." Lin did not say: In the future, Chung Cheng University will decide to improve the quality of students, and the number of students per year will not exceed 1,500.</p>

<h3>Officials from the Stabilization Fund Express Determination to Eliminate the Black Market for Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Negotiations to Ban Private Radio Stations in Hong Kong and Shanghai Have Been Conducted</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Officials from the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee stated: The sharp rise in the foreign exchange black market in recent days is largely due to psychological factors and not necessarily due to supply and demand. The market price of the Stabilization Fund is based on rational decisions made according to the income and expenditure of the national treasury and market conditions. The current black market exchange rate has entered a state of frenzy, so the market price will not blindly follow the black market. The recent tightening of the war situation in Northeast China and the rumors of opening up foreign exchange ownership are all important factors stimulating the exchange market. This committee hopes to obtain the assistance of all relevant parties and that the media will not make inflammatory reports in order to stabilize the exchange market. Regarding the unauthorized import of goods, someone believes that allowing imports will force everyone to sell at the black market price for foreign exchange, which will not help stabilize domestic prices.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: According to officials from the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, the undercurrent of the foreign exchange black market does hinder the export of exportable goods. This committee is responsible for the supply and demand of foreign exchange and cannot ignore it, and is trying to eliminate it. It is now approaching the stage of a "white-knuckle fight" and will give speculators a fatal blow. The current adjustment of the exchange rate will not follow the black market, but will still aim to promote exports. The rise and fall of the exchange rate will still be determined by factual needs. Varying the exchange rate is only one of the methods to promote exports. There are various other plans to cooperate in order to ensure that legitimate exporters have a way out and to increase the source of foreign exchange. The official also emphasized that there is absolute certainty in eliminating the black market, but the government must approve its plan and grant it special privileges. Furthermore, Hong Kong is the root of the foreign exchange black market, and speculators have secret radio stations to communicate news. Our government has negotiated appropriate measures with the Hong Kong government, which can be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A certain authoritative economist stated: According to the current foreign exchange black market price and the current number of government issues, the government only needs to use a portion of its existing foreign exchange reserves to recover all government issues. The government's property of the China Textile Company, the property of the enemy and puppets, and surplus materials, worth approximately tens of thousands of US dollars, are not included in this calculation. It is hoped that the government will take this opportunity to severely crack down on these unreasonable black market speculators. It is heard that black market activities are still centered on a group of commercial firms that use private radio stations in Hong Kong and Shanghai to communicate news and conduct mutual transactions. Financial authorities should strengthen inspections and impose severe penalties in order to serve as a warning to others. It is hoped that military and police agencies will strictly ban the private radio stations established by speculators so that black market activities can be completely eradicated.</p>
<p>Hesitation in Buying Newly Issued Chinese Stocks; Most Weaken at Closing</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market was erratic yesterday. Hong Kong and Shanghai Telecom continued to contract. Insiders took profits, and the market recovered after weakening. Loan news circulated again, and Yongsha returned sharply from its high, ending at a low. The weakness of small stocks and miscellaneous stocks became more and more apparent, and many were sold short. This is because the reduction of margin requirements has been hit, and except for Yongsha, they have all been eliminated.</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>The market opened slightly lower due to reports that the Ministry of Finance indicated it would be difficult to reduce the margin requirements for deferred transactions. After opening, Yongsha rose from 302.5 yuan to 315 yuan in deferred trading. No. 116 and others sold, retreating to 297 yuan and 311 yuan. No. 237 and others bought in deferred trading, and No. 163 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising back to 304 yuan and 319 yuan. Nos. 157 and 218 came to sell current and deferred Yongsha, and No. 226 and others also sold. The off-market interest rate opened low at 2.4 and 2.85 jiao, but because of the burden of four days, it was forced down to 296 yuan for immediate delivery and 313 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, No. 223 sold Yongsha and bought Xinhua, and No. 172 supplied current Yongsha, leading to an unstable situation. Nos. 89 and others bought current Yongsha, and No. 36 and others bought deferred Yongsha, and around noon they were pulled up again. No. 156 strongly bought current Yongsha, so the immediate delivery closed at a high price of 305 yuan, and deferred delivery reached 320 yuan, and then ended at 319 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Zhongs, Huochai, and Rongfeng showed small gains in the immediate delivery stocks, Zhongxing and Lian rose by 0.5%, Neiyi, Shuini, Zhabei, Huaxin, and HengHu were all flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, and Zhongfang fell by 0.5%, and the rest all fell slightly. In the deferred delivery stocks, Jingfu fell by 0.5%, Yongsha rose slightly, and all others declined slightly.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market</p>
<p>News of American loans of 1 billion came overnight, causing deferred delivery to open lower. Current delivery opened higher because of small margin calls. No. 24 bought, but many parties began to close out, and immediate delivery of Yongsha fell from 310 yuan, and deferred delivery fell from 316 yuan, with Nos. 89 and others selling heavily. Although Nos. 24 and 23 bought, they were still forced down to 298 yuan and 307.5 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Telecom report was low at 6.6 yuan, and the national bank's exchange rate showed a difference. Nos. 171 and 232 bought and rose slightly, but in the end, Nos. 65 and others still sold deferred delivery, and Nos. 89 and others heavily sold current Yongsha. With confidence wavering, immediate delivery of Yongsha was forced down to 294 yuan, and deferred Yongsha reached 302 yuan before closing at 305 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Yongsha, Xinao, Maya, Huafeng, Zhongfa, Neiyi, Jinglun, Zhongs, Zhabei, and Hengfeng in the immediate delivery stocks declined slightly, Xinguang, Jingshi, Shangwu, and Rongfeng fell by 0.5%, Zhongfang and Tongyi rose slightly, Shuini, Xinhua, and Huochai were flat, and according to the regulations, Huafeng declined slightly, and all others fell by 0.5%. Among the off-market old stocks, Zhonghua rose slightly, while Dasheng fell by 0.5%, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Current Delivery</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading: Yesterday, the interest rate difference was approximately 0.18 to 0.2 jiao, and the situation was stable. Yongsha's low price was 14.4 yuan, the high price was 15.4 yuan, and it closed at 15 yuan. Maya ranged from 20 yuan to 23 yuan, and closed at 22 yuan. Xinao was between 7 yuan and 8 yuan, and Xinguang was around 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange yesterday issued a notice stating: Broker No. 51, Zhuang Chongzhou, failed to pay overdue margin substitutes of US dollar bonds and was ordered by the Ministry to cancel his registration.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Mediocre; Foreign Stocks Unstable</h3>
<p>Government bonds were mediocre yesterday, with a trading volume of only 2 million. Room 552 advanced first and then retreated, while Rooms 551 and 503 advanced, but Room 230 retreated. Tongbing opened at 15,000 yuan and fell from 15,400 yuan to close at 14,400 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Tongbing was flat, Jiayi and Yi were down 100 yuan, and Dingwu was down 400 yuan each.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market saw gains and losses, and was particularly unstable. The Hong Kong-Shanghai Telecom report had narrowed to around 6.5 yuan, and confidence was mixed. Although the bank and foreign firms bought, the securities and Guangzhou firms sold. Yisha retreated from 168,000 yuan to close at 157,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Shipping fell by 10%, British United Paper fell by 0.5%, Xiangtai fell by a weak 10%, Jardine Matheson rose by 0.5%, and the remaining increases and declines were minor.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Negotiated Prices Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Stops Rising and Starts to Fall; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Retracts 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The negotiated prices of cotton yarn at the silk and satin association remained unchanged yesterday. The 20-count yarn was still listed at 15.2 million yuan, while other counts were set proportionally, taking into account market conditions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw weak actual sales due to the fact that prices outside of Shanghai were not as high as in Shanghai, making it unprofitable for yarn merchants to transport and sell. There was not much activity in the market, and the market weakened. Eventually, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn retracted 500,000 yuan from the previous day to 30.5 million yuan. The 20-count Extra Double Mali was flat, while the Light Double Mali fell by 200,000 yuan. The 16-count Guangming was down 400,000 yuan. Except for the particularly good 40-count Blue Phoenix, all other counts of coarse and fine yarn fell by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Spinning and Weaving Construction Company Starts Selling Allotted Yarn to Other Provinces</p>
<p>The Spinning and Weaving Construction Company started selling allotted yarn to factories in other provinces yesterday. The types of yarn sold were 10-count, 20-count, and 32-count. The price for 10-count was 10.59 million, 20-count was 15.2 million, and 32-count was 18.5 million, plus a flood relief donation of 250,000 per piece. The trademark for the 10-count yarn was Double Carp, the 20-count was Red Kui Star Dafajius and the 32-count was Fairy. The delivery locations for the above allotted yarn are Shanghai and Wuxi. The allocated quantities for each county are as follows: Wuxi 85 pieces, Changzhou 65 pieces, Suzhou 8 pieces, Nanhui 50 pieces, Zhenjiang 60 pieces, and Pinghu 12 pieces. Each factory can fill out a blue purchase order according to their allocated quantities and apply for purchase. Purchase orders were closed yesterday afternoon. Today, collect warehouse receipts from the Bank of China by paying with the purchase order.</p>
<p>Short Sellers are More; Cloth Market is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the midst of the government's efforts to suppress prices, everyone was wary and unwilling to buy. In addition, with the imminent opening of the silver future exchange, the funds were tight, and there were more short sellers than buyers in the market, which weakened the market and lowered prices. Throughout the day, except for popular bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and blue cloth, which continued to rise by 10,000 to 70,000, other types of clothing fabrics were generally stable, with most retracting 5,000 to 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Weathers Turning Soft as People Await A Reversal</p>
<p>Yesterdays Raw cotton prices were affected by soft yarn and cotton sales which caused a reversal in investor's enthusiasm. Though this has lead up to peaks over the past few days, cotton mills have remained unaffected, and the soft cotton shift is caused by a reluctance among merchants to sell cheaply. Only 1,100 bales traded. There was no opening price from factories, but the price offered for delivery was Lingbao at 4.2 million, 4.25 million, and 4.28 million; Metring at 4.65 million; Hanxi at 3.75 million, 3.8 million, and 3.85 million; Han Crude at a market price of 2.7 million and 2.74 million; Yuyao flower at 2.72 million and Zhoupu seed flower at 620,000.</p>
<h3>CITC Begins Processing Food Oil Order Loans</h3>

<h3>President Zhang Convenes National and Private Factory Owners to Discuss Current Yarn and Cloth Countermeasures; Changes to Textile Adjustment Pricing Await Consultation and Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, President Zhang of the National Bank convened representatives from national and private yarn factories, including Wu Weijing and Liu Jingji, to discuss current yarn and cloth countermeasures, focusing on three points: The distribution of yarn and cloth should be directed to actual users, avoiding excessive profits for intermediaries. The price of cotton yarn set by the Textile Adjustment Committee should adopt a flexible approach. In reality, the negotiated price differs significantly from the cost. How to change the pricing strategy awaits a decision after consultation between President Zhang and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. For factories that have already obtained import licenses, strict sanctions should be imposed for cotton ordered from abroad where the procedures are not compliant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Negotiated Price Increased, Averaging a Little Less Than Thirty Percent Higher Than Before</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Committee's sugar subgroup held its fourteenth evaluation meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning at ten o'clock, chaired by Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Economic Administration Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC) proposed that due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the cost of importing machinery and fertilizer has increased, leading to a corresponding increase in TSC's costs. The current market price in the production area is more than double the allocated price in this city, and the allocated price is too low, resulting in excessive losses for the national treasury, while intermediaries are given the opportunity for excessive profits. Therefore, they requested a reasonable adjustment to the allocated price of TSC sugar.</p>
<p>After evaluation, it was decided that the allocation price of TSC sugar will be adjusted starting from the 36th period, averaging a little less than thirty percent higher than before. In addition, it was also decided that sales would resume every Thursday, starting from the 36th period. The adjusted allocation prices are listed below: (Unit: Municipal Dan)</p>
<p>[Name] [Allocation Price] [Wholesale Price]</p>
<p>Special Grade Refined White Sugar 8.5 Million 10.32 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Grade 1 Refined White Sugar 8.2 Million 9.98 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Grade 2 Refined White Sugar 7.9 Million 9.63 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Special Grade Granulated White Sugar 8.3 Million 10.09 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Grade 1 Granulated White Sugar 8 Million 9.74 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Grade 2 Granulated White Sugar 7.7 Million 9.74 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Grade 3 Granulated White Sugar 7.3 Million 8.93 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Red Sugar 7.4 Million 9.05 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Rock Sugar 12 Million 14.38 Million Yuan</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Soar, Oil Prices Continue to Rise</h3>

<h3>On the History of Chinese Social Economy</h3>
<p>— Huang Xianglong</p>
<p>By Yu Jingyi, published by Dongxi Wenhua She</p>
<p>According to the publication date, this book can be considered a new book. It was first published in October of the 34th year after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the author's preface, his planned work on the history of the development of Chinese and Western social economies is divided into four volumes: the first volume is a new theory of world history, the second volume is a theory of the history of Chinese agricultural society (i.e., the history of Chinese social economy), the third volume is a theory of the history of Western commercial society, and the fourth volume is a theory of the history of dual-system culture in various countries around the world. As of the time I am writing this manuscript, Mr. Yu's third and fourth volumes have not yet been published; therefore, I have only read the first volume, "New Theory of World History," and the second volume, "History of Chinese Agricultural Society."</p>
<p>Normally, the first volume should be introduced first, but I am not prepared to discuss the new theory of history at this time. As for the second volume, it is not as much a part of the pure historical philosophy category as the first volume, and Mr. Yu also pointed out Guo Moruo, Li Ji, Tao Xisheng, Wei Juxian, Moriya Katsumi, Shi Fuliang, and others as objects of criticism in order to establish his own theory. Therefore, considering this book as a complete history of Chinese social economy, it does have its completeness and authenticity; I will first introduce it here.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five chapters: the first chapter is an introduction to prehistory, the second chapter is a critique of the theory of slave society in the Three Dynasties, the third chapter is on the feudal society of the Three Dynasties, the fourth chapter is on the nature of society from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Qing dynasty, and the fifth chapter is on the nature of society in the past hundred years. The division of chapters is also a periodization. Mr. Yu means that prehistory is one period, belonging to the era of primitive groups and ethnic societies; Xia, Shang, and Zhou is the era of feudal society; Qin, Han to Qing is the era of semi-feudal society; and the last hundred years is the era of semi-colonial society. As for the criteria for his division, in addition to Mr. Yu using the method of "destroying before building" to criticize Guo Moruo and others, there is his theory of agricultural cultural system. Although we dare not admit whether this dualism of historical development has complete validity, it is certainly valuable to use the agricultural cultural system to explain the history of Chinese social economy and to use the changes in the land system to divide the stages of Chinese society.</p>
<p>The primitive groups and ethnic societies of prehistory are generally not much of a problem. Since the Three Dynasties are the starting point of Chinese history, scholars of the valley school have also paid attention to them and have various different theories. First of all, because the social nature of the Three Dynasties is very difficult to analyze, they all admit that the Three Dynasties went through a stage of slave society. Mr. Yu first criticized Li Ji's "Theory of the History of Chinese Society," Wei Juxian's "Research on Ancient History," and Guo Moruo's "Research on Ancient Chinese Society" as the main objects of criticism. He inferred the mistakes of various schools, and from the distinction between slaves and slave society, the misunderstanding of serfs as slaves, and the quotations from Engels, Moriya Katsumi, and others, he judged that there was never a slave society in Chinese history. Mr. Yu's argument is that the Three Dynasties were a feudal society.</p>
<p>As for the nature of society from Qin and Han to Qing, there are Guo Moruo's initial advocacy of feudal society, Li Li's theory of capitalist production methods, and Moriya Katsumi's theory of one and a half stages of Chinese history, etc. The former generally commits errors such as regarding land ownership as state-owned, the parallel development of feudalism and commerce, and recognizing the native Chinese manor system as feudal. The latter, on the one hand, dissects Marx's "Asian method of production" and "pre-capitalist method of production," and on the other hand, fails to grasp the center of gravity of China, and develops into the theory of "immature feudal society." Mr. Yu believes that they either followed other people's models or completely entered the "four-stage formula," or they failed to grasp Chinese history, the "opposition between the feudal system and the prefecture-county system, the parallel existence of the aristocratic system and the bureaucratic system, the simultaneous existence of centralization and local decentralization, and the simultaneous development of the equal mountain system and the private property system" since the Qin and Han dynasties.</p>
<p>As for the nature of society in the past hundred years, there are Tao Xi's and Deng Chumin's semi-feudal theory, and Guo Moruo's, Li Ji's, and Shi Fuliang's theory of capitalist society. In fact, the former only looks at the feudal remnants of the past hundred years, and the latter seems to use the partial commercial cities to represent the entire society. Here, Mr. Yu quotes Mr. Xuan's article on the trends and characteristics of the changes in Chinese social economy after the Opium War, believing that the current stage of our country's social economy is played out by being attacked from both internal collapse and external corrosion. The trends are: from a closed-door economy to a passively open world economy, from a local economy to a national economy centered on cities, from a rural economy to a market economy with trade between China and foreign countries, from an old-style production economy to an industrial revolution economy, from a landlord group economy to a capital economy, and from a simple commodity economy to a monetary center economy. The characteristics are: transitionality, complexity, passivity, uneven development, semi-coloniality, comprador group, and social waste. From the above trends and characteristics, Mr. Yu believes that the current stage of social economy in our country includes four important contents: the invasion of the feudal social economy of agriculture by the capitalistic nourishment of commerce and industry will inevitably promote the collapse of feudal social economy and the growth of capitalism; the invasion of the inherent agricultural cultural culture by the external commercial culture will inevitably cause a complex change in the entire cultural system; the competition among the powers will make it difficult for the Chinese economy and society to advance even if it wants to become capitalist; and in the development process of all new capitalist economic constructions, it is bound to be affected by the competition and monopoly among the powers. These four contents are used by Mr. Yu to explain that China in the past hundred years is a semi-colonial society, especially the fourth point shows that China's new capitalist economy, which is growing up, is completely controlled by the powers of imperialism, which fully expresses the "semi-colonial" nature of China's national economy in the past hundred years. From recognizing that the past hundred years is a semi-colonial country, Mr. Yu pointed out that China must first remove all the shackles of the "semi-colonial" before embarking on national socialism in the future.</p>
<p>Although this book has its completeness and correctness, it can be regarded as a history of social economy, but it is obviously not enough for the adoption of historical materials. However, from the perspective of a constructive and authentic history of social economy, this book can be used as a wedge for a warning. I introduce this book, and I hope that scholars in China who have accumulated knowledge and deep thinking can write a comprehensive and in-depth history of Chinese social economy, because this kind of book is very much needed now, and it is still lacking.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Bibliography</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lu</p>
<p>Bibliography covers a wide range and is complicated, making it difficult to study. What is a bibliography? The preface to the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han says: "Whenever I finished reading, I would always list its chapters, extract its meaning, record and report it." From this, we can see that the so-called bibliography is just a list of chapters; in addition to recording the chapters, there is also a preface. Ordinary people think that a bibliography is the name of a book, but this is not the case. A bibliography is not just the name of a book; even an article has its own bibliography, and it must be categorized according to its nature, such as the nature of paintings, the nature of personal names, etc. This kind of compiling a bibliography has long existed in China. For example:</p>
<p>1. Bibliography: Liu Xin's "Seven Summaries" (main), Tu Mu's Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han (secondary)</p>
<p>2. Calligraphy Bibliography: Book of Sui (involving art)</p>
<p>3. Metal and Stone Inscription Bibliography: Song Zhi (referring to engraving)</p>
<p>4. Author Bibliography: New Book of Tang (i.e., today's personal name card)</p>
<p>To study Chinese bibliography, we must first observe the motivation for compiling the bibliography. There are two motivations for compiling Chinese bibliography: one is historical; the other is practical. The historical bibliography takes academic thought as its object; the bibliographical materials obtained through textual research and investigation are provided for scholars to study or refer to. The practical bibliography is like a commercial inventory or sorting account book, which is convenient for management and inspection; so its function takes management as its object. Researchers should regard the former as important.</p>
<p>Regarding the beginning of Chinese bibliography, historically speaking, it began with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's policy of collecting books. The earliest special works to appear should be Liu Xiang's "Bie Lu" for inventorying and Liu Xin's "Seven Summaries" for sorting. These two kinds of bibliographical books are quite similar to modern library catalogs. Ban Gu took Liu Xiang's "Bie Lu" and Liu Huan's "Seven Summaries" and compiled the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han, which is a historical document of books. He took the self-recording of books as his object, and narrated the deeds of his predecessors, which belonged to the historical category. Since Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han, there have been no similar books as good as the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Han Dynasty; it can be seen that compiling a bibliography is extremely difficult. Here, we already know that Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han was compiled from the "Bie Lu" and "Seven Summaries," so these three books actually have a consistent system, and researchers should start from this point.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of bibliography? Let's cite a few monographs to illustrate, and we can also see how bibliographers compile bibliographies:</p>
<p>1. Ban Gu took the purpose of bibliography as "distinguishing the origin of academic knowledge" (see the preface to the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han).</p>
<p>2. Ruan Xiaoxu (Shen Chao) wrote "Seven Records," he believed that the purpose of the bibliography is: In terms of quality: Distinguishing the origin of academic research, Clarifying the purpose of writing. In terms of quantity: The differences between names and volumes, Supplementing the omissions in the existing bibliography (refer to the preface to the "Seven Records").</p>
<p>3. Changsun Wuji's "Jing Ji Zhi" of the Book of Sui followed Ruan's regulations, Deleted names and prefaces, Deleted things that did not conform to the ideas of the time or were mixed up, and also removed things that were too cornered to the purpose of the book.</p>
<p>4. Xu Xinshan's "Seven Forests" mostly followed Ruan Xiaoxu's method to compile.</p>
<p>5. Shi Zhisheng's "Shi Jiao Xu Lu" made a great contribution to Chinese bibliography. He believed that the purpose of compiling a bibliography is: Distinguishing truth from falsehood, Clarifying right from wrong, Recording the past and present generations, Marking the number of volumes and parts, Collecting omissions, Deleting the duplicates.</p>
<p>Some people think that bibliography has become a thing of the past and does not need to be studied. This is wrong, because bibliography is the general summary of various academic knowledge; it has its own research value. From the statements of bibliographers quoted above, bibliography is also an introduction to reading. Wang Mingsheng said well in "Seventeen History Shang Que": "The study of bibliography is the most important thing in learning. You must start from this to enter the door," which proves the importance of bibliography.</p>

<h3>Rate the True</h3>
<p>— From Zhou</p>
<p>By Feng Zikai, published by Wanye Bookstore</p>
<p>"Rate the True" is a collection of essays published last year by Mr. Zikai. Before this, Mr. Feng had two collections of essays, namely "Essays from the Yuanyuan Hall" and "More Essays from the Yuanyuan Hall," both published by Kaiming Bookstore. They were popular throughout the country. Mr. Feng's articles are filled with a leisurely and innocent atmosphere. I am one of those who has been deeply influenced. Because of Mr. Feng's articles, I further came to know Hongyi the Monk, and then further read art and literature. To this day, I still make a living in this circle, so I must say that I have been somewhat influenced. Everyone knows that Mr. Feng is an artist. However, this is because they have seen his overflowing green paintings. His writing is successfully integrated with religion, art, philosophy, education, etc. This is fully revealed in his dealings with people and his scholarship. Therefore, his articles are light, elegant, and profound, and can move people. This is the reason.</p>
<p>"Rate the True" is divided into two parts. According to Mr. Feng's own preface, ten of the articles were written during the War of Resistance, and nine were selected from the twenty essays previously published by Tianma Bookstore. Therefore, this collection can be said to be the essence of Mr. Feng's essays. Recently, I saw it in the library. It had been a long time since I had seen Mr. Feng's writing! So I spent half a night reading it by lamplight. After closing the book, I lingered in my thoughts, feeling that this book could serve as a guide for young people's self-cultivation, and I had to introduce it. The "Speaking of Hongyi the Monk for Young People" and "Mourning the Beggar Teacher" in the first volume are both worth reading for teachers and students alike in today's world where the Way of the Teacher is lost. I long for the music of stringed instruments in our time and sigh at the so-called "respect for teachers." "Leaving the Yuanyuan Hall" is undoubtedly a portrayal of the chaos and separation during the War of Resistance. What is difficult for people to say is fully expressed in writing. I love his description of the four seasons of the Yuanyuan Hall. "The Geese of the Shaping Cottage" shows that human feelings can extend to animals. The middle volume is mostly about art, so I will not introduce it further. I believe that a person who studies art and literature can be free from loneliness and decadence if they can embrace Mr. Feng's attitude towards learning, understanding, and applying. As the ancients said, "Observing all things quietly, one will naturally gain insights; the beautiful scenery of the four seasons is shared by all." Then, one will be happy at all times. Most of the articles in the last volume have been published before, talking about life and children. I hope that people who do not love children, people who study children's education, or middle-aged people with many feelings may wish to take a look, so that they may sympathize with the "heart of a child."</p>
<p>Some people say that Mr. Feng's writing is "the writing of an artist." It is true that Mr. Feng has achieved truth, goodness, and beauty. However, this seems to be only one aspect. If we read his articles carefully, we can say that he has melted art, old and new literature, philosophy, religion, and education into one furnace. In today's new literary world, this cannot be said to be anything other than a success.</p>
<h3>The Miser Grandet</h3>
<p>— Ruofei</p>
<p>A Typical Character Created by Balzac</p>
<p>"Eugénie Grandet" is a masterpiece in Balzac's "Human Comedy" that focuses on depicting life in the French provinces. After reading it, Gao Ercha repeatedly mentioned it in his autobiography. In this novel, Balzac writes about the conflict between reason and greed, the distance between father and daughter, and the most vivid description is of Mr. Grandet's hoarding of money. The author treats Mr. Grandet as a typical miser. He writes about how Grandet treats his bankrupt nephew; how he is furious when his daughter secretly gives her cousin money; his wife is frightened by his anger and falls ill, but his first thought is that his wife's inheritance will fall into his daughter's hands, so he is extremely worried; late at night, how he locks the door and counts money in the warehouse, not letting anyone know; touching a coin seems to cure his illness; in old age, he asks for gold louis to be displayed on the table when he is dying, and his eyes stare blankly at them, saying, "This warms me!" After his death, he leaves his only daughter with the words: "Pay attention to the gold!... Put the gold in front of me!"</p>
<p>There are only two protagonists in this novel: Mr. Grandet and his daughter Eugénie. And they happen to represent two kinds of human nature; the former sees money as life, sees nothing but money, and is very mean in his actions and treatment of others, often unconsciously, believing that hoarding money is the only important thing in life; the latter is initially a girl who always takes her father's will as her own, but since her cousin Charles entered the family, she "breaks through the clouds and sees the sun," and realizes that many of her father's actions are contrary to human nature and violate the deep feelings between father and children. So, in her subconscious, she has a deep hatred for her father's greed. If Mr. Grandet's humanity has been submerged by money, then his daughter Eugénie is only a weak contrast. She feels that she should save her cousin Charles, she must sympathize with the weak, and she must fight against her father under the arrangement of love, but after living a life under Grandet's constraints since birth, she is still not enough to resist her father's greed. When Grandet finds out that his daughter has secretly given money to her cousin, he flies into a rage, and the daughter silently and bravely walks into the confinement room. If it weren't for Charles's love supporting her, who knows if she would have suffered a serious illness like her mother?</p>
<p>Charles's father went bankrupt and ordered Charles to seek refuge with his uncle Grandet in advance, but Charles himself was unaware and thought he was taking a winter trip. Grandet must tell Charles the truth.</p>
<p>"Yes, poor child, guess what, he's dead. But that's not all, there's something even worse, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head..." Charles told his nephew.</p>
<p>"My father?"</p>
<p>"Okay." Grandet continued loudly: "That's not so important, my dear nephew, that's not all, you can comfort yourself, but..."</p>
<p>"Never, never, my father! My father!"</p>
<p>"He ruined you! You don't have a penny!"</p>
<p>"What's the use of money? Where's my father?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>Painful cries echoed in the room, Charles ran away—he lay on his bed, covering his face with the quilt.</p>
<p>"I should let this storm pass," Grandet thought to himself, walking into the hall, "However, this young man is useless, he cares more about the dead than money."</p>
<p>Balzac used brilliant descriptions to write about Mr. Grandet's view of his brother's death. Misers are the most short-sighted. There is no "future" in their eyes. The present is everything to them. The society of money worship, the society with a strong decadent color at the end of the century, is fully active in Balzac's pen.</p>
<p>Charles took 5,800 francs from Eugénie but gave her a gold box containing a photo, asking her to keep it for him, and the main meaning was probably as a symbol of love. This gold box was later discovered by Mr. Grandet, so he said that the box was enough to offset the francs that Eugénie had lent to Charles, and he took a small knife to dig out the gold pieces on the box. At this time, Eugénie appeared very brave, even at the cost of fighting to the death. Balzac wrote this scene very beautifully. He wrote that in Grandet's eyes, the gold box was dazzling gold, and in Eugénie's eyes, it was a sacred symbol of love. The struggle between "practicality" and "idealism" resulted in the former prevailing.</p>
<p>However, what about the ending? After Charles wandered to India, he made a fortune by selling slaves, and he gradually moved from "idealism" to the stage of valuing "practicality" like his uncles. After returning to Paris, he took a fancy to the daughter of a certain duke, hoping to inherit his father-in-law's title, and had long forgotten Eugénie's love. In order to retrieve the gold box, he wrote a letter to Eugénie and sent a draft for 8,000 francs, as a repayment of the loan, with interest. As for the gold box, he asked her to send it by public carriage.</p>
<p>"Sent by public carriage!" Eugénie said, "Something for which I almost lost my life a thousand times for him."</p>
<p>Eugénie later married Judge Peng Feng, bringing with her Mr. Grandet's 17 million inheritance.</p>
<p>Naturally, as a female millionaire, she is happy, surrounded by people at all times, listening to others' flattery; but as a woman with a conscience, how lonely is she inside! How bleak is her life! In the eyes of the people surrounding her, she is just an incarnation of glittering francs, who can truly understand Eugénie's gentle, loyal, and sincere heart.</p>
<p>Balzac sighed: Long live utilitarianism!</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Romance of Sleeves</h3>
<p>— Weizhuang</p>
<p>Civilized people wear clothes, and two sleeves are indispensable. Since the Yellow Emperor first created clothing, the history of sleeves for thousands of years has been quite long.</p>
<p>In this autumn of rampant human desires and crumbling discipline, how often have we heard of an official who, after serving his term, steps down with clean sleeves? On the contrary, it is difficult to guard against people shooting arrows in the dark from their sleeves! Gentlemen sigh and sigh! Sleeves, sleeves, it is truly difficult to say!</p>
<p>Reading Emperor Chen Hou's poem: "Turning around, the pendant rings, pulling the sleeve, the fragrance of clothing rises," we seem to feel a graceful and beautiful woman, with a fleeting glimpse, arousing reverie. And the Mongols, after eating butter tea, wipe their sleeves around their mouths, and over time, they become as shiny as a mirror. Those who disrespect and stay away from them are few.</p>
<p>The story of Emperor Ai of Han cutting off his sleeve is a private matter in the palace. The language is inelegant and can be omitted. Those who see righteousness but do not act bravely and stand by are too indifferent and somewhat numb. In today's world, unsightly things are everywhere, and unpleasant words can be heard everywhere, so you will want to fling your sleeves and rise up. Those in power use public office for private gain, those below take advantage of opportunities, and those with hundreds of thousands of dollars (US dollars) are beautifully called long-sleeved good dancers, making people's hair stand on end.</p>
<p>A suit costs three to four million, and the buttons on the cuffs are worth a hundred times their weight in gold. Their origins must be carefully examined and described in detail to show solemnity. Do not underestimate these small buttons, they are still the legacy of the militaristic ruler, Frederick the Great of Prussia. At that time, he paid the most attention to the discipline of soldiers, and their uniforms had to be very neat. However, when soldiers encountered sweat on their faces, they repeatedly raised their hands and used their sleeves as rags, desperately wiping their faces. Needless to say, the two sleeves became unusually dirty.</p>
<p>Frederick came up with a plan and ordered a row of buttons to be nailed onto the sleeves. After that, even if the soldiers wanted to do something, they would have to give up because their faces would be scratched. It is said that the sleeve buttons on suits were originally used to roll up the sleeves and tie them up to make it easier to work, but later they gradually lost their effectiveness and became useless decorations under the sleeves.</p>
<p>Even gentlemen cannot avoid using their sleeves to wipe sweat, which is also a way to deal with emergencies. More than ten years ago, on a hot day, Guo Fuchu (Taiqi) was working in Shanghai and attended a public gathering. He stood on a high platform and gave a speech. Because it was hot, he was sweating profusely and unbearably. He reached into his arms, but was disappointed. He had forgotten to bring a handkerchief, so he had to resort to a more primitive action and simply wiped the sleeves of his linen gown repeatedly. As a result, the two sleeves became wet and stuck together, and the hands hidden in the sleeves moved unnaturally, as if a novice actor had just made his debut and his water sleeve skills were not yet up to par, and he did not know what to do with his hands, looking very embarrassed. Because I was also on the stage at that time, I saw it very clearly, and the impression is still deep to this day.</p>
<p>Whether news reporters use shorthand symbols to record speeches on their cuffs is seen in books but not witnessed, so it remains to be verified. However, it is true that pearl merchants make deals at tea parties. After they have made eye contact, they do not exchange a word. Both hands reach into each other's sleeves and use clear signals to bargain. If the talks are successful, the tense faces of both parties will gradually soften, like the rising sun in winter, first showing a ray of sunlight, then becoming brighter and warmer, until it reaches its climax. Both parties flick their sleeves, almost laughing out loud. This indicates: "The deal is done!"</p>
<h3>Fruits of Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Ashui</p>
<p>Xinjiang's fruits, melons, apples, grapes, pears, and peaches are the best. Melon refers to cantaloupe. Hami melon is one of the cantaloupes. People in Dihua call it "sweet melon," not much as "Hami melon." This is a cantaloupe as big as a pillow, but it is sweeter, crisper, and contains more water than any good variety of cantaloupe in the South. This melon is produced in early summer and can be stored in cellars until the end of next spring; Xinjiang people often say that eating this melon in summer and autumn will cause internal heat, but eating it in winter, such as chilled or frozen, is truly "icing on the cake."</p>
<p>Apples are produced in large quantities, and the best are those produced in Ertay, Yili. They are large and crispy, and their color and taste are very similar to imported Gold Mountain apples, but more fragrant.</p>
<p>Grapes from Turpan are the best, seedless, small and sweet, and dried, they seem to be even better than those produced in the United States.</p>
<p>Pomegranates are very large, and each grain is like a ruby.</p>
<p>Pears from Kuqa and Korla are the best, although not very large, they are sweet, crisp, and contain a lot of water. Even the best pears in Tianjin are not as good.</p>
<p>In the mulberry planting areas of southern Xinjiang, mulberries are also large and delicious, with black and white varieties; however, this thing is easily broken and cannot be transported elsewhere. Local Uyghur people who are idle often fill their stomachs with mulberries when they are in season.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of America</h3>
<p>— Pulun</p>
<p>America is not only a special country, but also a changeable and difficult to understand country; but many people say that if you don't understand America, you can't understand the times, don't you think it's strange? There are many poems and articles that desperately praise America, but it is easily praised and easily ridiculed. Yes, America, full of contradictions, often hides spiritual simplicity behind complex technologies, and behind this simplicity, there is unexpected complexity.</p>
<p>It is generally not a problem that people think highly of American literature, but the works published in those illustrated magazines are a literary vacuum, so low-level and terrible that even the most casual readers in Europe will avoid them.</p>
<p>America is constantly making great efforts to improve their intellectual level. They have universities with extremely complete facilities, and the best libraries and laboratories are attached to them. There, it is common to see scientists being valued by the market. However, Tennesee University is strangely unbelievable, because this school does not allow lectures on evolution; the law there prohibits any theory that contradicts the Adam and Eve myth in the Bible.</p>
<p>In large cities in America, there are "Lion" clubs. Famous businessmen gather there, and each person wears a sign indicating his business nature and location. Before eating snacks, they stand up and imitate the "whoo-hoo-woo" sound of a lion's roar. This kind of game is still considered a pure thing. Along with wealthy merchants, there are also many pure dreamers and noble idealists; they believe in utopianism, they forget meals and devote all their money and energy to realizing the mysterious plan of a "world government."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that respect in America is centered around money. In thousands of registered churches and denominations - money; but America also has people who don't buy new shoes or watch movies, but save people from being convicted and dying in the electric chair. However, there are organizations everywhere to protect the rights of black people; good people in America are always opposed to barbaric persecution.</p>
<p>Americans are full of childishness, they don't like pretense, they are frank, curious, noisy, and active; when they are sitting in a house, they often like to stand up and change seats; they move from this city to that city, from this state to that state without hesitation. The character and style of Americans are exactly the opposite of the British. The British are polite and quiet; they like to live long and die in the house left by their grandfather; they like to have clothes made of first-class materials, and if they can't wear them until they die, they will at least wear them until the next election. Americans only like new clothes, wear them once and throw them away. They often buy shirts that are not worth washing; they value old shoes and like bright new ties.</p>
<p>Everything in America is new; but in the legal district of New England, the buildings built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are preserved; this "ancient district" is a place that people yearn for.</p>
<p>In America, annoying events often overshadow people's sense of history; for ordinary Americans, almost an era has changed between the morning paper and the evening paper, because the things that trouble them in the morning, they often forget in the evening.</p>
<p>Someone said that if you want to understand America, you must always remember its age; this sentence is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America on the Screen</p>
<p>Due to the development of the film industry and the worship of movie actors by the public, I dare say that there is no American girl who does not want to climb the silver throne and taste the taste of being a star, except for those who are too old and ugly or have dedicated themselves as nuns. Indeed, Hollywood is the only tempting place in the world, with the highest salaries, the most affluent life, the most luxurious villas, and the newest cars, who doesn't want to enjoy it? However, although there are many opportunities in Hollywood, it is not easy to gain a foothold in the silver circle. If you have a skill, even a dog can become a star. If you have no skill, even if you are trapped in Hollywood for a lifetime, you will not be able to enter. The bosses of film companies are people who have turned somersaults in the snobbish circle. When they need you, they will kneel at your door. When they don't need you, they will kick you away. Every year, tens of thousands of wealthy girls bring a large amount of American dollars to Hollywood to socialize, wanting to step into the door of a film company, but the result is failure and return. However, if you know the secret, you don't need to climb the silver queen's throne. First, you must use the stage, nightclubs, model companies, and newspapers as stepping stones. Many stage actors, nightclub singers, model company models, and cover girls of pictorials are invited to Hollywood by film company representatives, and they rise from the ground to the sky, leaping to become red stars. Film companies would rather hire successful drama artists at high prices than spend money to train actors themselves. No matter what scientific method is used, they cannot test out true drama artists, so film companies are unwilling to spend a sum of money in advance. American women are all dramatic, and there is no difficulty in recruiting talents. Some female stars can't act, but they can skate, or ride horses, or swim, and they can also become popular stars. Directors and screenwriters specialize in skating, riding, or swimming as themes and shoot films. Such talents cannot be found in the Chinese film industry. The success of the American film industry cannot be entirely attributed to the organizational power of film giants. American women should be given the first credit. Few American film productions do not feature female actors as the protagonists, and films starring female leads must have thighs. Thighs are America's national treasure. Marlene Dietrich's thighs were once insured for two million US dollars, which was the price ten years ago, and now with inflation, it is certainly more than this number. Once a woman steps into the door of a film company, it is like ascending the dragon gate, her value is tenfold, and she has the title of Hollywood star. In addition to the generous salary in the company, they also broadcast on radio stations, record records in record companies, and serve as visiting lecturers at universities, so their income is multifaceted. Even if they fall from the silver screen, they will not lose their jobs. They can also develop to radio stations, stages, nightclubs, and model companies. Women who have been gilded in Hollywood seem to have an extra layer of protection in their lives. American society has always treated Hollywood figures differently.</p>
<p>Biographies</p>
<h3>Naval Veteran Sa Zhenbing</h3>
<p>— A Wilderness</p>
<p>It is said that Admiral Sa Zhenbing, who was once very famous, has also become very destitute recently. The newspaper said: The alumni of the Wusong Merchant Marine School who work in the shipping industry in Shanghai, seeing the old principal's bleak old age, specially donated 500,000 yuan each, pooled funds for interest, and sent it to Fujian every month to maintain Sa's life.</p>
<p>Some people are surprised: Why is it that a high official who has served as the Minister of the Navy and the Governor of Fujian Province would be so impoverished? This is precisely the admirable thing about Mr. Sa. Anyone who has heard about Sa's character and behavior must know that his frugality and integrity are truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>When Sa was the principal of the Wusong Merchant Marine School in Shanghai, he also seemed to be serving concurrently in the Navy Department. In theory, he could have built a Western-style house and purchased a car in Shanghai, but Sa did not. He always took the tram and only booked second-class rooms in hotels. When he was the Governor of Fujian Province, he went to the small vegetable market in plain clothes every morning to personally purchase vegetables, meat, and fish, and returned home to hand them over to the servants to prepare lunch. Every time he went out, he always carried an umbrella and never had an entourage.</p>
<p>Sa graduated from the Royal Naval Academy in Greenwich, England in his early years. When the Qing court founded the navy, he was one of the first naval officers trained abroad. During the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, he personally participated in the battle. In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, he was serving as the Admiral of the Qing Navy, and was ordered by the Qing court to lead the Yangtze River Fleet to Wuhan to suppress the "bandits." However, he had already been "flirting" with the revolutionary army. When the fleet arrived in Jiujiang, he ordered the artillery to fire, but "only allowed to fire at the sky, not allowed to injure people." The late Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, was often under Sa's command at the time. Finally, Lin Sen, together with Sa, launched a "rebellion" to support the revolutionary army. The "skyward cannon" also stopped firing, the fleet changed its serial number, and came to Shanghai together.</p>
<p>After Sa left the political stage, he devoted himself to charitable causes, for about thirty years now, but he still maintained considerable prestige in the political world, and is still a senior advisor to the Naval Headquarters. The Incident of 1934 was able to be resolved quickly without bloodshed, and it was mostly due to Sa's efforts. Even three-year-old children in Fujian know what an amazing person this kind and amiable "Old Buddha" is.</p>
<p>I heard this story about Sa: Sa had a male servant who was quite diligent and was appreciated by Sa. As a result, Sa married his daughter to that male servant, and this "flattered" new son-in-law worked hard to make progress after marriage and actually became successful. - If these are facts, then Sa's mind, which does not have any class concepts, is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance broke out, the Central Government specially sent Mr. to be an envoy to Nanyang to comfort overseas Chinese. At the age of eighty, he traveled back and forth, working hard for the country. After the mission was completed, he went west to Chongqing to report, which was deeply appreciated by the Central Government. Later, he made a trip to the Northwest. General's footprints were everywhere in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Although his spring and autumn were high, he could still ride freely and look around at ease. In his spare time, he wrote poems and articles, and his ambitions were not shallow.</p>
<p>After the victory, he returned from the mainland and went to Shanghai, and soon returned to his ancestral home in Fujian. Last year, due to arteriosclerosis, his body weakened, and the doctor ordered him to rest at home, and he did not pay much attention to the current situation. Here, I wish General good health!</p>
