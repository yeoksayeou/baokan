<p>〔中央社鄭州十九日電〕共軍劉伯誠部，近已為驚弓之烏，其中明智份子，紛紛向國軍投誠，據精確統計，該部實力已損失三分之二。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕隴海路附近共軍劉伯誠部經擊潰後，損失甚重，殘部畫夜不息，向鉅野以北潰走，國軍正分路急進圍擊，預料可在黃河南岸全部予以殲滅。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十九日電〕共產黨中央鑒於魯南之敗，近正積極將遼東共軍增調魯省，據報日來大迎·烟台間帆輸往來如織，已有二三萬人在烟登陸南開，正繼續增調中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十九日電〕新泰南鰲陽鎭方面，仍在對峙狀態中，原在該處共軍解四·解九師一部調至新泰東北之碁山·諸龍峪·一部調至新泰正南十二公里之石泉莊。另新四軍第一·第六兩師，又自泗水北調至萊蕪西南十二公里冶店一帶，觀其企圖似在積極部署，有三面圍擊萊新模樣。</p>
<h3>冀東共軍三千投誠　平漢北段續有戰事</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕冀東共軍騎兵三千人投誠，國軍長官部已派員前往點編，惟地點尙未發表。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕平漢北段高碑店車站，昨夜一度受共軍襲擊，松林店西方十二里之東西城坊·柳村等國軍據點，同時遭共軍二千人襲擊，激戰一夜，共軍退去。松林店南方鐵路被破壞一段，行車整日受阻，徐水·漕河間被破壞之鐵路，軍方限二日內修復，電車十九日通徐水，沿站車輛阻塞，軍運仍忙，共軍化整為零，沿站破壞襲擊。</p>

<h3>若干國營輕工業將逐漸改為商辦　中紡公司等或公開出售</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕根據經濟緊急措施方案，凡國營生產事業，除屬於重工業範圍及確有顯著特殊情形必須政府經營者外，應即分別緩急以發行股票方式，公開出賣或售予民營商。聞宋子文近曾令王雲五於廿日內擬具出售步驟。經濟部奉令後，正趕擬計劃中，聞屬於經部之國營事業，共有兩大部份，其一為中紡公司，另一則為中華菸草公司；中紡公司分支機構，普及全國，共有紗錠一百七十萬支，資產估計的値一萬億元。其中一部份有獨立性質者，出售較易，其他若干公司則將以發行股票方式，陸續使民間資本增加，使其最後成為民營。該部商業司長鄧翰良定十九日晚乘車赴滬，與各有關方面共商此事及其他與緊急措施有關事務。又資委會所屬輕工業工廠，有糖廠四家，紙廠三家，電器廠三家，水泥廠四家，或亦可能以發行股票方式，吸民間資本。</p>
<h3>公用事業價格　最近不臻增加</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕蔣主席十六日發表談話時，曾謂：「各項公用事業如政府繼續貼補，則預算無法維持，故此後應酌予合理增加」。記者以此詢有關方面，承吿過去所採取之貼補政策，固足减低公用事業享用者負担，然以全體國民所付予國庫之金錢，以减低一部份人民之負祖，究失公允，因之，政府為平衡預算，而减少貼補，殊為合理。至一般公用事業價格，當局雖考慮作合理之調整，常最短期內尙不致實現，將來增加時，其數目亦不致過鉅。</p>

<h3>租借法案中規定物資　美可能繼續供給　顧大使演說促加緊援華</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕據接近美國政府之人士稱：國會可望於下星期一通過法案，准許政府繼續以租借法所規定之物資供給中國以及其他各國，俾有助其經濟安定及完成復員，除中國一國而外，尙有英，法，蘇，澳四國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕中國大便顧維鈞今夜在中美工商會議席上發表演說，相信蔣主席必能挽救中國之經濟危機，由中國人民及與中國經濟之有關人士協力達成其預期結果，並籲請美國增加其對華援助，其言略謂：中國亦與其他國家相同，在戰後獲得美國之財政援助，但數量有限，除聯總救濟物資之外，中國所獲得之借款僅一萬四千三百萬美元，而英國則獲得四十四萬萬美元，法國廿四萬二千萬美元，而中國政府在戰後進行復興與救濟計劃，至少需款二十萬萬美元，但聯總之計劃則僅及此數之百分之廿一，並以聯總至本年六月卅日前即將結束，其對華工作故亦未能完全實行此有限之計劃。美國人士有謂：中國目前之混亂情形，乃由其自己所造成，此實大謬不然，而非中國特有之現象，如歐洲「經濟組織良好之國家」，今亦有此同樣情形，要知中國作戰時間最長，所受損失亦最大，此為任何聯合國所不及者，故今日經濟之陷於嚴重狀態，實並不足為驚奇。中國現所急需者，乃外國之援助與合作，尤其是美國，如此始能發展中美兩國之商業關係，而使前途即能迅速改善。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕顧維鈞大使今日在中美工商會演說稱：法幣價値於一星期前狂瀉之現象雖屬荷重，然不可以為中國經濟必致破產，但若無外國國尤其是美國適當之援助與合作，則局勢當無法長期控制。</p>
<h3>無關國防工業　顧氏贊同民營</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕顧大使非正式表示，贊同本國政府決定將重要國防工業以外之工業分別標售，改歸民營。據稱：戰時設立之全國資源委員會，經營工廠三百家，製造各種出品，茲決定除有關國防之重工業外，將其餘工業全部售予民間，或出售其股票，　舉殊堪稱道。同時，美元對法幣新匯率之訂定，將為中國幣値穩定之因素，中國實在需要棉花及其他接濟品，以助其戰後工業，恢復生產，一俟新措施充分生效及中國購買力穩定後，進口貨之採購即將開始。中國將為美國各種消耗品，各種食物製成品以及日後各種重機器與工具之重大市塲，惟須視其外匯盈餘而定。中國方面，則準備立即開始輸出大批鎢·銻·皮毛·猪鬃·茶葉與生絲出品，希望以美國為其大市塲，其中多數貨物以前曾以英國為主要市塲。</p>
<h3>我國困難情形　馬歇爾極重視</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕中國大使顧維鈞昨與國務卿馬歇爾進行會談之後，抵此吿記者稱：馬卿對中國之困難情形，極為同情與重視，至其會談內容及有吾談獲決談，顧大使則不願宜布，僅謂：會談係屬一種「解釋」性質，進出口銀行所擬貸予中國之五萬萬美元一項借款，亦曾提出討論，但幷無任何決定。關於美國調解中國政治問題一事，則幷未加以討論。顧大使繼謂：蔣主席今已決定將國營工廠改由私人經營，此舉當將較諸加以變賣更能充裕政府之財政機構，該項工廠係由政府之戰時措施所加以接管，多數皆不願生產獲利，致政府受其賠累，今歸還私人經營之後，當可使政府不致再受此耗損。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕國務鄕馬歇爾頃吿訪員稱：余昨日與中國大使顧維鈞進行會談，曾與之詳細討論中國之局勢，顧大使幷曾要求美國予以援助，尤其是棉花與小麥等物。</p>
<h3>福州物價下跌　台管制進出口</h3>

<h3>銀樓業飾金交易　數量將予以限制　京銀業向當局建議四點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕加强金融業務管制辦法公布後，經營銀樓業者，咸以今後能否繼續飾金買賣為慮；蓋其營業範圍若僅限於銀器，則業務將無法維持。記者為此訪負責草擬「製成飾金業處理辦法」之某官員，承談稱，銀樓經營金塊金條，本超出其業務範圍以外，根據新辦法，自當予以完全蔡止。至飾金買賣或不至全部禁止，惟每件重量及每月每日營業額，或將予以限制，使其不成為變相之黃金買賣。處理辦法初稿已擬成，現正呈上級核閱，週末或下週初以前，可望公布。</p>

<h3>民社青年兩黨　駁斥羅隆基演說　民盟偏向中共乃不可否認事實</h3>

<p>民社黨聲明</p>
<p>據民社黨發言人稱：羅氏認本黨應負破壞政協之責任，試閒本黨有何力量破壞政協；另一方面，本黨實亦無力維護政協，渠又認本黨不應放棄爭和平，而去爭民主憲法，此種見解，實屬錯誤，因民主係逐漸進步者，即在內戰期間，民主之進步，亦決非不可能。羅氏稱：翻遜所有憲法，沒有一部在國家分裂期中制定者，以羅氏之「博學」，竟不知德國魏瑪憲法即係在國內不統一狀况下制定者，羅氏又反對本黨參加「沒有根據政協基礎」的國大，固無論國大之召開即係政協所規定，即非根據政協，然則政協之法律根據又在何處，渠妄稱本黨與政府進行秘密談判，實則本黨並無秘密可言，一切活動均已見諸報章，渠認參加　機構，係關閉和平之門，渠應知民主逐漸實現後，國共問距離即可接近，和平之實現更有可能。</p>
<p>左舜生談話</p>
<p>靑年黨左舜生昨發表談話稱：羅氏之意，對當前時局應負責任者，只有國民黨及靑年民社二黨，中共民盟，則似乎毫無責任，以羅氏之立塲，惟有如此說法，但我認爲政協與戰爭是不能同時存在的，有戰爭即無所謂政協，根本上破壞政協者，乃是戰爭，誰個打仗，即是誰要破壞政協，最近幾個月來，至少國民黨方面，有二度發起停戰，一度是關於張家口停戰十天，一度是國大開幕前政府自動停戰，可惜二次停戰，均爲中共拒絕，因不能停戰而造成目前局勢，究應由誰負責，此點應値得羅氏鄭重考慮。靑年黨無武力，民社黨民盟亦無武力，對當前局面的責任，都很輕微，我們無意將責任諉之民盟，惟有二事値得回憶，一是國大開幕前第三方面人士在南京交通銀行經長期商談成立一具體方案，向政府中共同時提出，政府對此方案還未表示態度時，羅氏以民盟人士，受中共嚴厲責以難，即將此方案自動撤回；另一係第三方面向政府提出一緩開國大，繼續協商之具體方案，常時第三方面人士，俱曾簽名，但在提出前，民盟人士於向中共代表團進行接洽後，一部民盟人士，又要求取消簽名，惟羅氏並未取消，値得敬佩！此二件事實，民盟中一部份人士，偏向中共一方，應是不可否認之事實，要復活政協精神，停戰是先決問題，不知羅氏對中共一再拒絕和談，感想怎樣？</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>太平洋島嶼托管</h3>
<p>關於太平洋島嶼的托管問題，美國政府又於一昨經由其代表團向聯合國機構提出托管的計劃，請安全理事會加以考慮。此一計劃包括太平洋一千五百個襄在日本統治下，而現爲美軍所占領的島嶼，其中最著名約有馬紹爾，瑪利安納及卡羅林羣島。依照此計劃，這些島嶼將仍在美國的單獨統制下；而美國又得在若干被稱爲「禁區」的地帶設防，不受聯合國機構的管制。同時聯合國憲章竹規定統治國家對於所托管的地區應隨時呈送報吿；而美國此次所提的托管計劃卻包含有若干保留，卽美國政府得自行選擇應行呈送是項報吿之地區。此卽表示對於若干統治地區應該呈送報告，對於若干地區可不必呈送報吿，美國政府有自由決定之權。此外，美國的提案又提出托管島嶼應與美國所統治的地區成立財政，關稅及行政的聯繫，使這些島嶼在行政經濟上與美國合爲一體。此一計劃的提出，雖據聯合國機構的廣播，目下安全理事會的議程已經很擠，因而什麽時候能够提付安全理事會討論，現猶未定；但無論安全理事會的工作如何繁忙，此一計劃的必將提付討論，當無疑義。</p>
<p>在精神情感方面，對於美國所提出的太平洋島嶼托管計劃，在大體上我們自然表示十二分的贊同。在這些島嶼上，曾有不少美國靑年犧牲在它們荒凉的海灘上，密茂的叢林中。這些島嶼在太平洋戰前大都是在日本的委任統治下，美國的軍隊旣以流血的犧牲占領了這些島嶼，爲了此後他們自身的安全及整個世界的和平，由於戰爭的結果而使他們獲得這些島嶼統治的這一宗事實，應該獲得國際間一致的承認。美國在參加這次世界大戰前旣曾以租借法案的物資，此在中國所得到的實惠，雖極渺小，協助盟邦，在參戰以後又竹派出火軍協助作戰。由於美國自己的軍事行動而取得的這些太平洋島嶼的軍事統治，應該贏得國際問一般的認許與支持。從道義上講，我們對於美國所提出的托管計劃，無可非議。</p>
<p>不過情感是一事，法理又是一事。此次美國政府所提出的托管協定計劃，原曾於去年十二月六日公布，且已分別送交安全理事會各理事國曁菲列賓及紐西蘭兩國政府存照。其後英蘇澳三國政府曾要求美國俟對日和約簽字之後，再行提出；乃美國出席聯合國機構代表團竟不顧英蘇澳三國之意見提前提出。關於此點，我們覺得倒沒有什麽多大關係。太平洋島嶼的托管問題終須提出，趁對日和的尙未簽字之前，先行提出，亦爲得計。若干人士以爲美國政府之提出是項托管協定的草案，遠反了美國在大西洋憲章和開羅宣言中担保不作領土擴張的諾言，和杜魯門總統在波茨坦聲明「不尋求一寸領土的擴張」的聲明，也是互相矛盾的。我們於此所要指出的是：托管是一事，領土的擴張又是一事。至少在法理上，托管不卽是領土的擴張。美國以軍事力量占領了這些島嶼，現在之向聯合國機構提出托管協定草案，正是顧全到聯合國機構集體安全的體制。此在美國，無寗說是一服苦劑。洒在太平洋這些荒島上的是美國的血，而它卻還須向這國際機構提出它的托管計劃。爲了國際正義，對於美國所提出的這個計劃應該祗有同情，而沒有惡意的抨擊。不過美國所提出的若干保留，如美國政府得自行選擇應行呈送報吿之地區，以及關於若干「禁區」的規定，似顯與創設聯合國機構及設置托管制度的原來目的，頗有出入。如何能使這協定草案所提出的規定能與聯合國機構的精神相調和，是則有望於美國政府及安全理事會的再番考慮。</p>
<p>至於說美國之要獲得這些太平洋島嶼的托管，其目的在對付中蘇：這又未免太張大其詞。中美間向有傳統的友誼；中美間將來會有戰爭是太不可想像的事。我們不能爲這種流言所惑；論其實際，這似乎也是一種有國際背景的反美言行。第二次世界大戰後的太平洋已是面目全非了。在西太平洋稱覇的日本如今旣已沒落；而在北太平洋的局面也已有了極重要的變動。作爲北太平洋屏障的千島庫質，如今均已改隸蘇聯版圖，是蘇聯的勢力已突伸出在北天平洋上。千島的改隸，僅見於所謂雅爾達協定。這原是英美蘇三强間的一種協定，旣沒有其它對日作戰各國的參加，而關於日本舊屬島嶼的處分又不曾得到聯合國機構的通過，就理論上言，本沒有法律上的的束力。但這已是旣成事實。在這個時侯，而美國有太平洋島嶼托管協定草案的提出，我們不能不佩服就是在這一問題的處理，美國政府還多少尊重國際法治的精神。</p>
<p>在太平洋島嶼的處理上，我們所不能不提出的是關於沖繩琉球諸島的問題。這些島嶼原隸中國版圖，在開羅，對於這些島嶼之沒有明確的決定，不是說我們已經放棄對於此等島嶼的要求。對於這些島嶼，我們保留我們的要求；若不得到我們的同意而移付托管，中國人民必起而一致反對，這是我們所必須指出的一點。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾覆文公布　美拒絕蘇聯抗議　謂艾克遜言論合於職守</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕國務鄉馬歇爾已正式照會莫洛托夫，謂國務副郷艾克遜近在參院某委會坦率致辭，有謂蘇聯外交政策具有「進慶及擴張」性質，對於此項言論，在美政府之民主方式下，吾人不應稱共為不可取之言論，此事實乃責任上之問題。馬歇爾之覆文係答覆二月十四日蘇聯照會者，經美駐蘇大使史密斯送交蘇方，並於本日在此間公佈。按蘇聯之照會稱，艾克遜此項言論為「相魯之謾駡，且對蘇聯極為敵親，」並籲請美方注意「艾克遜之不可取行為，渠已不顧其職位，隨意發表此項言論。」按艾克遜此項言論係為答覆麥克凱拉參議員之問題而作者，時為二月十日，其時參院委會方聽取李速索爾氏之意見，以便決定任命李氏為美原子能委會主席之推薦案。蘇方之照會並謂麥克凱拉之問題，為對於蘇聯之「粗野的攻擊」</p>
<p>照會全文</p>
<p>馬歇爾之照會全文如下：『史密斯大使轉下二月十四日之台函，業已收到，內稱：閣下對於國務副郷在美國參院一委員會所發表之聲明，稱之為不能容忍之行為，閣下對於此項聲明，認為無禮之誹謗，而含有仇視蘇聯之意等云。閣下所認為不滿之言語，並非由國務副卿自動發表，而僅為答復參院中某一議員之質問。此種答復係在該委會主席絕對許可之質問中發表者。此種雙方問答之言語如下：參議員麥克凱拉問：「現在假定蘇聯不但思獲取其已有之各國，而且更欲擴展其領土，則閣下是否相信，蘇聯倘發見原子彈秘密，則該國不但將攫取歐洲其餘部份，其至將囊括世界其餘部份乎？」艾克遜答「余並不以為此一問題，能照閣下所詢問之方式」答復之，余深知蘇聯之對外政策，實為一種侵略與擴張之政策。余以為目下各人在聯合國中所作重大努力之一，即為企岡設法解決此類問題。此等方法與協定，若果能覓得，則可希望將來不致有大規模之衝突，否則，余以為局勢被為嚴重。」</p>
<p>閣下全然明瞭敝國之憲法制度，包括敝國政府立法部門與行政部門之問，權限各有分別。依照吾人之制度，行政部門之官員在立法部門之委會中，其職責所在，必須坦白答復不牽涉秘密或違反公衆利益之各項問題，此稱情形從無例外。職是之故，國務副卿坦白而依照其良心答復質問，此種行為，殊不能稱為不可容忍，而實為符合其職責。閣下指渠之聲明內容，為無禮之誹謗及仇視蘇聯。根據吾人之標準，對於一種公共政策，發表有的束之批評，殊不能認為誹謗。因此，余知閣下再加思索，當不致以坦白誤作仇視矣」。</p>
<h3>美仍希望四強締約　佔領德國四十年　馬卿出席衆院外委會議　討論當前國際緊急問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕美國國務卿馬歇爾頃吿報界稱，美國仍擬依照前任國務郷貝爾納斯去年提出之建議，而與英蘇法三國締結條約，俾維持和平並解決德國問題。美國現仍未放棄此種希望，國務院現仍認為貝爾納斯之計劃，係屬可行者云。馬帥今晨曾參加衆院外交委員會之秘密會議歷二小時之久，相與討論對於國際關係之緊急問題。馬帥循衆院外委會若千委員之請，將於星期三再度出席該會，答覆若輩對於美國政策一般方針所提出之間題。</p>

<h3>印制憲工作遭遇新危機　英將召回魏菲爾　傳英在規定時期內可能退出印度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：紐約時報倫敦特派員稱，在一二日內英首相艾德禮將發表重要聲明，宣佈英國對印將採取對巴力斯坦之同採步驟，一年以內將印度完全交還印人管理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕權威人士今日聲稱：英政府因印度制憲，發生新危機，己決定召回印督魏菲爾，首相艾德禮明日將在下院宣佈此事，同時，並將公佈白皮書，明日之宣佈，對印度「極關重要」。據某員答覆問話謂：「英國在規定時期內氾出印度」，非不可能。該員不願詳細解釋此言。印度最近危局，乃因回盟一再拒絕參加制憲議會而起。英方官員稱：危局有炸裂印督臨時政府之處，大會黨領袖尼赫魯近函魏菲爾，力言印度內閣仍有同盟閣員五人，實與回盟拒絕參加制憲議會之方針不符。旋回盟五閣員聲明無意辭職，魏菲爾向英政府請示，英內閣遂於上週與本週述續會議，討論印度僵局。官方人士又種：上星期尼赫魯二次致書魏菲爾，要求倫敦政府早日答覆，並警吿魏氏，除非同盟閣員立即辭職，否則大會黨閣員九人均將退職。</p>

<h3>恢復金本位　打擊共產主義</h3>
<p>美國商業鉅子主張</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社芝加哥十八日電〕美對外貿易協會長亞勃定克，今日在此問世界貿易會議發表演脫，主張美國應以流通金幣作為打擊共產主義之方法。據稱：美國鄭重考慮鑄造及流通金幣，時機已至。金本位之重建，將使國際共產主議信徒間混亂，並可立即使其信用掃地。每一商業國家，除蘇聯外，均希望其貨幣在國際市塲價値抬高，藉以刺激對外貿易。恢復金本位可使全世界不再存物物交換之想，物物交換制度為蘇聯所愛好，美國所關切者，惟有以價値為基礎之制度。</p>
<h3>日本賠償計劃　待美國作最後決定</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十九日電〔美對日賠償政策即將決定，俾便利日本之經濟復興。賠償物資之搭運，則將於美國政策　定不久後即開始。此計劃將為日本一般賠償計劃之基礎，蓋太平洋戰爭有關國家對此問題，猶無全體協議之計劃，而此問題必須於日本工業能從事計劃戰後經濟之前加以解決。至於盟國未能獲致協議之主要原因，常為蘇聯反對將其自中國東北方面所獲之「戰利品」，自其所應得之日本賠償物資中扣除一端。美日本賠償政策將根據賠償代表鮑萊對社魯門總統之報吿，及七人扶術專家小組各所擬之報吿而決定。鮑萊報吿係依政治等因素而定者，主張嚴厲削减日本經濟力量。七人小組報吿則純係根據自技術方面而擬定，兩者各趨極端。美國之日本賠償政策雖即將決定，惟賠償物資之搭運，仍未能立即開始，正式搭運項待數月後。惟拆除運輸及裝蓮之計劃工作刻正進行中。</p>
<h3>艾斯勒被起訴</h3>

<h3>巴勒斯坦會議始末</h3>
<p>英將以巴勒斯坦向聯合國機構提出，但不致本年九月間聯合國大會開會前，要求召開緊急會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕貝文外相今日在下議院宣布英國擬將巴勒斯坦問題向聯合國機構提出之決議，渠謂談判之破裂係因猶太及阿刺伯雙方均採取不妥協之態度，目前已無可能之解決辦法。</p>
<p>貝文宣布　英方態度</p>
<p>外相宣布之其他要點，計有：（一）英政府深知已無依照一九三年白皮書成立解決辦法之可能；（二）英國以委治國之身份，處境困難，同時又不欲向雙方任何一方，强制執行仲裁性之決議，因此遂決定將該一整個問題向聯合國機構提出；（三）英國將詳示聯合國機構，委治在目前之不可行，並提出英猶阿所曾提出之各種建議；（四）英政府深知聯合國機構於九月間召開全體大會前審查巴勒斯坦間題之困難；（五）渠特別聲明英政府最近提出之方案具有逐步迅速完成巴勒斯坦獨立之切實諾言，然仍為猶阿雙方所拒絕。</p>
<p>覓取解決已無可能</p>
<p>貝文外相並詳述前此處理巴勒斯坦問題之經過稱：本人自就職以來，即力圖解決巴勒斯坦問題，支持政府之人成覺已不能再依一九三三年之白皮書覓取解決方案。由於美國猶太族對猶太復國觀念甚為關切，遂於一九四五年十一月任命英美巴勒斯坦調查團，同時並決定每月准許猶人一千五百名移入，此外並許猶太人一萬二千名於白皮書停止適用後，移入巴勒斯坦，總計自一九四五年七月以來，准許移入之猶太人共達二萬九千名。</p>
<p>談判基礎着重分治</p>
<p>英美委員會之報吿書發表後，即由英美官員予以審查，共同建議以莫理遜之分省自治計劃為基礎，邀猶阿兩族談判，然巴勒斯坦之猶阿兩族均未接受，而阿拉伯國家之代表卒於一九四六年七月卅一日在倫敦與英方舉行會議。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族於今年一月參加會議，猶太協會則始終拒絕參加，僅於會議末期，曾與英政府在會外舉行非正式之談話。猶阿雙方均拒絕莫理遜之分省自治計劃，惟阿拉伯則提出反建議，主張平日設立巴勒斯坦獨立國，永久保持阿拉伯居民之大多數，英政府旣知莫理遜計劃已無作為談判基礎之可能，遂又提出新建議，擬設立猶太及阿拉伯之兩自治區，另設由兩族分擔參加之中央政府，復規定在今後兩年內每年准許猶太人四千名移入。此外復有一前此之方案所未有之特點，即允諾於託管五年後，逐步迅速完成巴勒斯坦之獨立。然猶阿雙方又拒絕接受該一方案，於此本人擬一申述兩族一再拒絕之理由。巴勒斯坦之獨立，終不能免，依據民主原則大多數居民應有自行決定其國家命運之權。</p>
<p>猶可主張大相逕庭</p>
<p>阿拉伯認為猶太人之繼續擴大，足以妨碍巴勒斯坦阿拉伯之獨立，故反對猶人之繼續移入以及猶太國之建立於巴勒斯坦任何部份土地內。猶太協會之最後目標乃為建立巴勒斯坦猶太國，故最初建議由英國繼續委治，使其得以繼續擴大猶太地盤，准許猶人移入，至前後要求巴勒斯坦猶太國之獨立。其後猶太協會又提出分治巴勒斯坦之折衷計劉，惟要求猶太移民事宜應由猶協管制，因此英政府所面臨者乃為兩個不能妥協之原則，巴勒斯坦有阿拉伯居民一百廿萬人，猶太居民六十萬人，後者要求設立猶太主權國，而前者則堅決反對。</p>
<p>唯一途徑提請公斷</p>
<p>就已往數月之談判觀，深知己無以談判成立解決之可能，根據委治規定，英國不能以巴勒斯坦獻給猶太式阿拉伯放，或擅自決定分治，因此唯一之途徑，祗有請聯合國機構決定矣。在聯合國大會於九月召開以前之過渡期內，吾人仍常繼續執行我委治責任。</p>

<h3>監察團雷厲風行　公益號囤米破獲　店主金仲良在逃賬房拘解警備部　據供曾向某機關行賄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟監察團糧食組昨日破獲囤積大量食米並向公務員行賄之米號一家。該組組員蕭復權接獲密報，謂貝當路九百八十二號公益號，圃積大批食米，企圖高價出售，蕭於得報後，即行派員澈查，該號於此時已得風聲，即將囤於天平路六二四弄一號之食米，漏夜搬移至貝當路九八二號。當經蕭派員按址搜出囤米二百三十五包，該號店主金仲良事前己聞風逃往七　，當將其賬房楊經舫加以逮捕。據楊供稱：該號日前因囤米為某機關所發覺，當時行賄法幣六百萬元及食米十二祖了事，並呈出一槪證件。蕭得供後，即將其送往警備部，將以非常時期囤積食米擾亂民食罪，及行賄罪依軍法嚴辦。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日紗布市塲繼續由經濟監察團派員監視，市况平穩，南北米市塲則因來貨稀少，上午市價有趨昂之勢，宣司令獲報後，甚為震怒，以本市米價上週隨金潮波動，米商乘機抬價已屬不法，後經鄭介民將軍召米業代表萬墨林曉以利害，萬即面允逐日將售價壓低，恢復二月一日以前之原價。監察團本此方針執行，絕無變通餘地，經令糧食組組長王仲靑負責澈查，如有人作祟立予逮捕。米商米販得訊後，未敢喊高，並自動抑平價格，與昨日無甚出入。其原已按較高價成交者，亦予抑低，以前日市價結賬。又社會局公米前昨數日以米市來源充沛，無配發必要，未有出售。今日市塲如萬一供不應求，將再拋出相當數量，故米價當不致趨漲。</p>
<p>追究套購黃金大戶</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟監察團金鈔組與財政部及叫聯總處合組之三人小組委員會，昨日繼續積極進行澈查金潮工作。關於中央銀行部份，業已吿一段落。監察小組係根據央行配售於同豐裕，方九霞等五家大銀樓之金條數量，追查此五家轉售與小行莊之數量，再調查小行莊之賬目而根究最後購進黃金之人物，然後加以彙計分析，相信日內即可明瞭套購黃金之大戶為誰。昨晨十時，三人小組指揮下之工作人員，曾於中行二樓集議，並由財次徐柏園指示工作方針。繼即分成八單位，分別調查私人銀行錢莊之賬目，特別注意用黃金抵押而輾轉套購之非法投機。但截至昨日止，尙未拘捕任何嫌疑人物。外傳有金號經理多人被扣之說，實屬不確。</p>
<h3>銀樓業請恢復金飾買賣　擬就臨時營業細則四項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市銀樓業同業公會以最近政府禁止黃金買賣，銀樓業停止營業，非但影響職工生活，且使農民無法購置飾物，實非獎勵之道，故特擬就臨時營業細則四項，請求市參議會主持公道：（一）銀樓製售飾品每件重量不得超過關秤二兩，並不得熔化小條出售。（二）准許銀樓收兌飾金，其價格遵照中央銀行所規定者。（三）收兌金飾除供製售飾品外，有餘應售給中央銀行，如不足則向中央銀行申請配給。（四）營業利潤由銀樓商業同業公會參酌營業情形及生活指數並徵求中央銀行同意決定之。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕前晚銀樓首飾業代表向市參議會及市商會請願，以金飾實為一種平民儲蓄，以備不時之需，並非純為裝飾，似無禁止之理。潘議長及徐理事長認為該業所稱尙屬實情，即經由市參議會與市商會會銜電呈中央，請予規定收兌出售及加工定製金飾，仍不禁止，惟每件以關秤二兩為限，以示限制。</p>

<h3>紀念新運十三週年　每一國民應知奮發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨為新生活運動十三週年紀念日，上海市各界於昨晨九時假座大光明戲院舉行隆重紀念會，到吳市長，潘議長，宣司令，方主委等及各界人士千餘人。會塲根據新運宗旨，佈置莊嚴簡樸，主席台前列鮮支五盆，後懸黨國旗及國父遺像，並掛新生活徽記及「禮義廉恥」（見圖）之綠色大字，四週綴以「明禮義」，「知廉恥」，「負責任」，「守紀律」各種標語。在弧光燈反射下，莊嚴燦爛。</p>
<p>九時正大會開始，行禮如儀後，由主席吳巿長報吿，略謂：新生活運動對於抗戰有重大作用，今日上海特別需要推行新生活運動。蓋新運之宗旨，在重振舊道德，發揚禮義廉恥之固有精神，對於當前之民族病態，實為對症下藥。今就本人到滬八月中所見，深覺目前局勢動盪其癥結在於人民情緒頹唐。此種親象之形成，乃由二字作祟，其一為一私」字，諸如投機操縱，囤積居奇，鼓動金潮，挑撥內戰是也。其二為「偽」字，往往假仁假義，言與行違，如此欲使國富民强，抑何可得。故深感國人「私」「偽」兩種性格，亟須革除，應化「私」為「公」，化「偽」為「實」，國家民族始有新生希望。</p>
<p>潘議長致詞，說明參議會建議公用局將國際飯店上之「禮義兼恥」四字大放光明，即在警惕人民，實行新生活運動。唯僅使此四字重放光明，並無意義，新運推行，必須每一國民身體力行，勤儉節的，善自奮發始能達到國富民安之目的。</p>
<p>市黨部方主委致詞略謂：新遝之精義，在於明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守法治，今日新運十三週紀念，吾人試以上海情形論，是否有人眞能實踐新運之要求，反之言與行違者則比比皆是，國人生活進已日趨腐敗，救治之道，端在新運，惟局勢之混亂實為最大障碍。</p>
<p>宣司令則稱：新運在中國已推行十三年，目前上海大部份市民在舊生活中已義成惡習慣，吾人必須澈底實踐新運之要求，改變社會風氣，新運之推行，不僅在標語口號，必須剷除一切頑固之反對心理，本人願迫隨全市市民之後首先實行之。繼由參議員張中源，費樹聲，邵永生等相繼演說。散會後，當即放映「鐵骨冰心」電影。</p>

<h3>抗戰勝利後　敎部接收重要文物　徐伯璞科長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕據敎部主辦文物之社會敎育司徐伯璞科長談：日本投降後，關於文物之接收，按照敵僞產業處理條例，均應交由敎育部辦理，杆政院根據此項條例亦曾三令五申，飭所屬各機關遵辦，最近國民政府復通令於標賣敵偽產業之時，不准包括文物，並須將文物即行移交敎育部，如違而不遵者，即予嚴懲。綜觀種種設施，具見政府愛護文物之至意。敎育部鑒於保存文物關係我國文化命脈至鉅，經詳密籌劃，除臨時成立淸理戟時文物損失委負會，擬訂整個保存文物計劃，並嚴令該部各區特派員切實注意外，對於其他機關接收之文物，無不費盡心力交涉，雖歷經週折，總設法接收，以期早日交付有關機關整理研究，籍謀保存。然自開始辦理以來，究竟接收了多少，及接收了些什麽，社會人士，頗多關心，爰將重要者略述於後：（一）毛公鼎：此鼎爲宇內彝器冠冕，日本投降後，原所有人陳詠仁先生鑒於私人收藏，於變亂時期毫無保障，乃由葉譽虎先生等之介，呈獻政府，並指明交中央博物院接管，然以週折輾轉，一年後（本年八月初旬）始由主席交下，現已由敎育部令交中央博物院籌備處　藏。</p>

<p>滿偽宮書畫</p>
<p>（四）滿洲偽宮帙出賞薄傑藏書：勝利後，國軍接收長春，旋即退出；於退出之時，董副參謀長彥平受張嘉璈先生之囑，在偽宮中檢選最珍貴典籍共十三箱，空運瀋陽，存中央銀行倉庫。現已於八月中旬點交敎育部淸理戰時文物損失委員會駐東北區代表金毓　先生，由中央圖書館館長蔣復璁及中央博物院籌備處主任李濟之在塲監視，暫時妥存於敎育部東北區敎育復員輔導委員會之瀋陽圖書館。此項書籍宋版幾佔二分之一，如宋版新唐書通鑑及通鑑耙事本末，皆係全帙。又如宋版六家文選，竟有七種之多。核對賞溥傑書目悉在其中，約當全目三分之一。復據董副參謀長稱：運出之十三箱，皆爲宋元善本，其他未運出之書籍，仍有數十木箱，較運出之書籍稍次，惜均毀於共軍入長之時矣。關於滿洲僞宮帙出學　傑之　畫，敎育部曾奉主席電令密查收歸國有，今僅獲此一部份典籍，刦後剩餘，亦云不易。</p>

<h3>公開羽球揭幕賽　男雙打緊張精彩　劇戰三盤陶倪組獲勝</h3>
<p>（本報訊〕首屆羽毛球公開錦標賽，於昨晚六時，在市體育館作開幕賽，觀衆較聯賽時爲熱烈。羽毛球遊戲，係全身運動，規則雖與網球不同，而練習方法實與網球大同小異，其與趣精采，頗不亞於網球遊戲。昨晚開幕賽三塲：（一）男初單打，道奈而勝郁鍾耀，十五比二，十五比〇。（二）男子雙打，陶冠球倪正一勝吳國　何傳龍，苦戰三盤，十八比十七，十七比十八·十五比十四，緊張精彩，空前未有。　混合雙打，曹宏然葉競雄小組勝蔡克文平治門小姐，十五比十，十五比九。各塲戰情如次：</p>
<p>男初單打</p>
<p>男初單打，郁鍾耀對道奈而，六時起賽，爲本屆開鑼戲，道氏攻多於守，正手殺球頗見實力，故形勢成一面倒，傾刻成十二比一，第一局以十五比二勝，第二局郁君改變戰略，一再抽殺，卒因番將用位置球及佯攻方法，以十五比〇再勝第二局。</p>
<p>道奈而　十五比二　十五比〇　郁鐘耀</p>
<p>男子雙打</p>
<p>六時四十分，男子雙打繼之而起，吳國燾與何傳龍兩人之聯絡，似較對方爲佳，以四比〇領前，旋因陶倪兩人之抽殺，頓呈緊張局面，比數接近，成六比五，九比八，十二比十一，一番劇戰，俄傾造成十三平手，吳何因係首先獲十三分者，乃按照規則，得採用寬放決勝分數Setting爲五分之權利。</p>
<p>再戰時初成各一，吳何攻勢强盛，成四比二，因過於緊張，一　再自殺，被陶倪追出，反以五比四獲勝第一局，出乎意料。</p>
<p>第二局初戰各四平手，陶倪動作鎭靜，使對方無隙可乘，一度以十三比五又成懸殊狀態。事有凑巧，觀衆　聲中又來一個十三平手，無獨有偶。</p>
<p>事關重大，搏鬥愈凶，在各二時雙方拼一個你死我活，輪流失攻者歷二分鐘，殺成各四後，吳何一記辣手，以五比四成寃家對頭，使球塲空氣，頃刻轉變，秋色平分，遂有第三局之爭。</p>
<p>第三局陶倪七比一順流而下，何吳兩君係一對眼鏡先生，目力之差或成失利因素，陶倪終以十五比四得利，奠定大局。</p>
<p>混合雙打</p>
<p>男女混合雙打，爲昨晚壓台賽。曹宏然葉競雄小姐上塲後即以六比一佔上風，蔡克文與「洋密斯」平治門，因搭擋欠佳，平又屢次撲空，曹葉以十五比十勝首局，以十五比九連勝第二局。平行動滑稽，笑時怪聲，更添觀衆興趣。</p>

<h3>敎部體委方萬邦　談台閩體育情形　台胞體育興趣普遍濃厚</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕敎部國民體育委員會委員方萬邦，於上年十一月二十二日由滬飛台灣，視察體育敎育，至十二月五日，由台灣飛福建之福州視察·一月下旬始油福州乘輪，輾轉過滬，於本月上旬回京，向敎部復命。本報記者頃前往訪問，承談視察體育情形：</p>
<p>方萬邦氏於台中，台南，高雄，彰化，屏東，嘉義，新竹等地視察各學校，及社會敎育六十餘校，渠觀感所及，覺有三優點：</p>
<p>視察台省感想</p>
<p>（一）台灣有優良氣候和環境，（二）有優良的體育設備，（游泳池，體育塲，健身房，大運動塲等設備齊全），（二）一般人具有普遍體育興趣，而其缺乏者，視察時尙無　全體育行政組織之機構與社會體育團體，並缺少體育領導人才和師資，及適當的體育敎材，經與該省敎育行政當局接洽，提出建議：關於行政組織者，建議該省成立「國民體育委員會」，與全省性之體育團體，現經採納已組成委會及團體，又建議訓練現在代用敎員，急於　致全國體育人才，以增進和提高敎員素質，已得同意，積極進行；又建議增設並加强體育師資訓練機關，已令師範學院添設體育系。關於經費者，建議體育預算獨立，並撥專款補助體育之　設，設立體育用品製造廠，設法向中央衛生署購配衛生藥品等項，亦在分別準備進行之中。關於敎材方面，建議組織「體育敎材編審委員會」，刪除不適當敎材，補充介紹新敎材與規定各級學校體育設備標準，均經採納計畫。關於社會敎育，建議分期成立各級體育塲，現決先在台中，台北，合南，分別籌設，並已派人加强管理。</p>
<p>視察福州意見</p>
<p>方氏在福州，計視察中學二十四校，專科以上七校，國民學校二校及其他團體設立之二校，又臨時奉部令調查專案二起。渠感想所及，覺大多數校長及體育敎員，均知體育重要，並相當努力，惟限於經費及塲地，以致多數學校於體育設施，未能達到理想標準，曾提出希望數點：（一）建議敎應督學室，宜添設一富有體育行政及敎學經騐之體育督學，以計畫督導並推進全省體育事宜。（二）加强師範學校及體育專業訓練機關之設備課程及師資，以造就小學體育師資。（三）加强或調整專業訓練機關及體育塲，以提高體育效率。（四）加强省體育塲管理行政，俾充分供給學校及社團體育活動。（五）規定各級學校最低塲地及設備標準，並限期完成。（六）凡已達標準之學校，如體育事業費不敷，得增加體育費，但須單獨預算，呈主管機關核定。（七）師範學校不收體育費，應設法補救，或專列科目預算。</p>

<h3>絲吐絲繭　新議價尙未開出</h3>
<p>絲吐，絲繭，因係外銷物資，自美匯匯率調整後，各貨已不能維持原盤，市塲新議價格尙未開出，預料貨價趨升後，來源可以增加。</p>
<h3>當局關心民食　米價以昨市為準　只准跌不許漲　到米仍多市勢突見回挺　麺粉雜糧價格普遍上升</h3>
<p>據上海經濟監察團糧食組王仲淸氏談：本市食米交易自即日起，各檔米價均須以（十九）日報價爲准，以後只准跌不許漲。如有從中蠢動，私圖抬價者，准隨時檢舉，依法嚴辦。並面諭南北二市塲負責人，應將每日到貨交易買賣情形，按日呈報云。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>昨日米糧到源數量，南市場四九二〇·二〇石，北市塲六九一八石，二市共計一萬一千八百餘石。各帮來貨依然不寂，市勢突見回挺。良以迎日疲落已多，產價與申市漸吿軋近，一般販戶因有關成本，不擬輕脫，致各方人心見定。面各米店亦以等待低價已有數日，趁此良機互相添補。是以走銷確較上日爲活，交易亦見增加，市乃轉弱爲強。粳秈米行情均回振三四五千元不等，惟陰變元去化仍狹，價形平定。聞北市塲俏勢較南市塲爲勁。</p>
<p>麪粉</p>
<p>略見起色，然交易陷入停滯狀態，蓋社局人員坐鎭塲內，以致粉商絕少活動，掮客亦鮮蹤跡，但暗中形勢爲米價所帶挺，貨主售價漸堅，實銷則仍呆滯，故全市竟未聞正式成交。利朗洋粉價在七萬二一千元，兵船粉價在五萬一二千元，的比上日回挺二千餘元。麩皮，投機氣氛復見熱鬧，市面驟升二千餘元。小麥貨少價堅，惟無做開。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>市亦挺秀，在各物漸轉回昂聲中，塲內疲憊之氣象已不復存在。兼以恢復配油消息迄無下文，故本街乘低扒吸，執貨者喊價亦見步高升，市氣逐漸堅昂。最後蔞生油價爲廿三萬元，吉桶生油價爲廿七萬元。生油回升三萬元左右，豆油跟之上挺萬元光景。小車藤油亦秀萬元，太廠淸油廿一萬萬元有成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>普遍回升，黃豆跌定之後，廠本兩方去胃頗感活潑，市步挺二三千元。蠶豆到存兩枯，按步前進四五千元。荼豆回挺三五千元，赤豆亦露堅象。芝蔴貨樣見少，市亦挺升六七千元。生仁供求尙稱平衡，市呈平疲之格。豆餅客貨仍乏起色，價形疲疲。紅糧相仿。</p>
<h3>華南華中銀根奇緊　內匯匯率又加調整　廣州每千由十五元增為四十元</h3>
<p>政府之經濟緊急措施方案實施後，各地銀根奇緊，尤以華南及華中爲甚，廣東各地之黑市匯水，日來每千增至一百二十元，漢口高漲至每千爲二十元，山東之青島亦受波動，每千亦達五十元，中央銀行有鑒及此，特於十八日將內匯匯率重加調整，（按新匯率十七日始公佈已見時報）華南廣東區，廣州每千由十五元增為四十元，汕頭每千由五十元增為六十元，其他各地亦由五十元升爲六十元，湖北區，漢口武昌由五元改爲十二元，沙市宜昌由六元改爲十五元，其他各地，十二元改爲十五元，山東區，靑島由十元增至三十元，其他各地升爲二十元，浙江區之溫州，亦由廿五元增至三十元，僅江西區合地減低二三元不等，華南高度之黑市匯水，商業行莊方面，祗能維持開支，無利可獲，據悉：此次廣東之波動，係受金鈔嚴厲取締後之影響，而澳門·香港兩地，又不能直接通匯，亦爲其主要原因。</p>
<h3>中植仍按原價　配零售商食油</h3>
<p>中植廠昨配售乙組零售商第二〇一壁至四〇〇號食油，每桶計三六〇市斤，價格仍按上决原價，計每市担國幣一七〇·〇〇〇元，外加送力國幣六·五〇〇元，每桶共價國幣六一八·五〇〇元，十九日備安支票，付款，廿日交貨云。</p>
<h3>鮮腸收價　每副暫定二千元</h3>
<p>匯率改訂後，鮮腸價格，因賣戶扳持不售，而外埠客貨來滬，各工廠紛紛爭購，致收價復由每副一千七八百元漲至二千元，公會方面以國外售價，目前仍在下降中，外商曾企圖殺低至每副美金四角，惟正式市價總在五角餘至六角故本市鮮腸收價不應任其高抬，公會暫定每副最高價爲法幣二千元，一俟本週內國外正式市價及交易情形確定後，公會即凖備召開緊急會議，以便議訂收購價格，至光腸市價，屆時當亦可確定云。</p>
<h3>統債走勢再見俏利　丙種喊出一萬關外</h3>

<h3>收兌美鈔數額　三日逾二百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日賡續收兌黃金美鈔，惟以持美鈔前往求兌者，日形擁擠。前昨兩日，每日逾千人以上。兌換數額，亦較前擴大，央行二樓業務局外匯科櫃台，已不敷應用。故昨日起，央行又添設新櫃三處，專事收兌。聞自十七日起，三日之間，收進總數已逾二百萬云。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣會　執委今日開會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，爲配合政府新頒行之經濟緊急措施方案，積極謀輸出貿易之推廣起見，已定於今日上午十時，在中央銀行總裁室召開會議。聞屆時對宋院長日前召集該會執委及顧問等會談時所摘錄之意見，亦將分別提付討論</p>
<h3>行莊頭寸漸鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行稽核處長李立俠吿記者：上星期六市塲頭寸甚緊，現已轉鬆。前數日因出口補貼辦法之宣布，本市有大批款項匯出，至產地購買買出口物資，本市一時頭寸减少。同魄，政府新經濟措置宣布後，各行莊間之往來大爲减少，致基礎厚業務穩之行莊頭寸甚鬆，而基礎薄之行莊頭寸甚緊，現時逾兩日，情勢漸和緩，故市上頭寸已較鬆動。目前檢查行莊之工作，尙在開始階段，其結果發表尙有待。</p>
<p>又悉：市塲頭寸經連日緊俏後，昨起已漸轉鬆動。四行二局昨在票據交換所差出頭寸達七十餘億元。各行莊間頭寸，亦轉鬆動。市場游資，經數日觀望後，昨日遂麕集證券市塲，致各種股票漲停板者，比比皆是。惟紡建公司昨日開售大批棉紗，台糖公司今日亦將循例售糖，故可能又將吸收市塲頭寸一批云。</p>

<h3>茶市依灰停滯</h3>
<p>邇來茶葉市况，異常沉靜，良以日前自當局將對美匯率調整至一二，〇〇〇元後，執貨者喊價直上雲霄，漫無標準。其中尤以各式外銷茶，幾咸抱不忍割愛之勢，因此連日買氣雖濃郁不散，結果終以談判難望圓滿，交易卒陷於停滯局面。</p>

<h3>煤球配給數量　難如報載之多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：自中樞決定日用必需品配給辦法後，燃管會已對煤球之配給向經濟部提供意見，將來可能配給之數量，恐難如報載之多，否則將影響社會上其他用途。記者頃自有關方面獲悉：最近煤斤之抵埠者，較之過去略少，原因爲秦皇島港口冰凍，運輸受阻，而台灣之礦工因生活關係，工作效能亦減。主管機關希望能採辦河南焦作之煤，運輸路綫或取道津浦綫運至南京，或先自平漢運至漢口，再由水道運滬。惟兩綫所需之車輛，均尙在接洽之中。至於安南之鴻基煤，過去曾一度接濟本市，現因法人以越南煤荒爲理由，禁止出口，短期內無恢復希望。</p>
<h3>工業油脂平疲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕春節過後，工業油脂，飛騰甚烈，平均價均上漲數倍，計椰子油每担自二〇萬漲至八十五萬元，牛油自十八萬漲至六十五萬元，柏油自廿五萬漲至五十五萬元。以皂廠吸胃至强，故脚地頗爲堅硬，價格一再上颶。惟日來銀根轉緊，各皂廠及油脂工廠，懈於吸收，持貨者咸欲脫貨求現，價格紛紛下降。樹牌椰子油今市每司馬担喊價爲五十五萬元，五千萬至五十二萬有成交。牛油每司馬担爲四十萬元，嘉興本車柏油，每市担由五十五萬跌至四十萬元。</p>
<h3>台灣出口水果　下月可望解禁</h3>

<h3>客銷雖寂同業交易頗暢　紗市昨反動回升　紡建代開二一三六件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市反動回升，因速日所跌已巨，引起業中人吸胃，念支紗的好二三十萬，四十二支三十萬，然客銷仍寂迄少辦進，市上成交者，以同業買賣居多，脚地未見十分穩固。午後紡建代紡管會開紗，共有紗綫十二種，價與上期相仿，承購有相當踴躍。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日第二次代紡管會開售棉紗，共售二一三六件，廠家佔一二三二件，號家佔九〇四件。申請戶數共計六一五戶，廠家佔四二九戶號家佔一八六戶。此次該公司指定十六支金元費，配毛巾，染織，內衣，針織各業。廿支藍鳳，配染織，帆布，毛巾等業。廿一支足球，配織廠。四十支實光，配染織，針織，手帕，內衣什字等業，其餘則照配。</p>

<h3>呢羢市氣軋緊</h3>
<p>昨長樂及棋盤街呢羢市氣，全部軋緊，貨價大半均不願喊開。蓋自美票調整至一萬二千元後，對於呢羢成本影響頗重，大體上須看廠盤開價上漲至若何程度，方可定心再做交易，因此若干店舖每人限剪衣料一件。買方旣因實力關係，復因價漲銷細，花色殘缺，只得互相觀望袖手不前。</p>

<h3>我國主要出口貨　價格漲跌互見　豬鬃桐油等一致向榮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自新外匯率公佈後，我國主要出口貨品，或漲或跌。其中豬鬃，桐油，茶葉，皮毛，等，皆高漲數成至一倍等。絲綢蛋類則稍趨回跌。茲將各種貨品上週六之價搔，與昨日價格作一比較，分別叙述於後；　豬鬃上週六每擔一百六七十萬元，昨日價格爲二百八十萬元，的漲起六成，然持貨者多不願脫售，故購買困難。目前豬鬃之國外價格，皆一致回小，依目前市價出口，的可得利潤百分之一或二，一般出口商行，多在觀望中，擬待國外價格穩定後，再行出口。</p>
<p>桐油　價格在上週六經公會議定爲每擔四十六萬元，至昨日無變動，惟一般桐油商皆不願照價出售，故購買不易，其出口情形與豬鬃同。</p>
<p>茶葉皮革均見起色</p>
<p>茶葉價格變動較烈，溫州茶上週價格爲二十萬元一擔，至昨日已漲至四十餘萬元，漲高一倍以上，價格奇俏，購買困難，故出口猶覺不易。</p>
<p>皮革方面的平均漲起四成，漢口羊皮上週六每擔五十五萬元，昨日九十萬元。四川羊皮上週六每擔七十萬元，昨日一百二十五萬元。牛皮上週六價格大磅每擔七十萬，中磅八十萬，小磅一百二十萬，昨日價格爲大磅一百萬，中磅一百二十萬，小磅一百八十萬。因皮革之生產季節僅僅剩二月，故貨缺價俏，其出口利潤較其他貨品為佳，約可得百分之五，目前已頗多出口者。</p>
<p>毛貨價格，羊毛上週六每一百斤四萬元，昨日漲至六七萬元間。鴨毛上週六每每擔廿八萬，昨日到卅萬。其中羊毛因國外需要甚少，故鮮有出口。鴨毛與頭髮雖可輸出，然大宗出口者甚少。</p>
<p>絲綢蛋類稍形回跌</p>
<p>生絲價格，上週六C級每擔八百十五萬元，D級七百八十萬元，昨日價格爲C級八百萬元，D級七百六十萬元，皆稍見回跌。綢價四十寸緞每碼二萬四千五百元，交織軟緞每碼一萬二千元，上週六與昨日市價相彷彿。以前絲綢出口皆須虧蝕，此次外匯改訂後，可無虧蝕之處。</p>
<p>蛋類價格上週六爲私蛋每一百市斤卅七萬元，鴨蛋每一千隻大號卅五萬，中號卅三萬，小號卅萬，昨日市價鷄蛋每一百斤卅三萬，鴨蛋每一千隻大號卅四萬元，小號卅萬元，小號廿六萬元，　一致回跌。據某蛋業公司云，蛋類價格以後仍可下跌，故其出口比較樂觀。</p>

<h3>濟南十二日航訊　本報特派員麗天　收復臨沂後的山東戰局　徐州會戰已成尾聲　魯南會戰正式展開</h3>
<p>由蘇北共軍主力竄入魯南，隴海路以南劉伯誠部主力回竄魯西的這一戰局的發展，無疑義的，已昭示我們共軍鉗攻徐州的企圖已被粉碎，徐州會戰至此也已成了尾聲，代之而起的應是由國軍為主動的魯南會戰了。</p>
<p>所謂魯南會戰，其作戰境地，應該是包括東起蘇魯邊區黃海之濱，西迄隴海路徐汴段以北的穌魯冀豫邊區及黃河與膠濟路以南的廣大地區。在這作戰地區中，國軍正以三支强大兵力向這地區分攻合擊，因之，就目下情形說，又顯然地，可把這作戰地區劃分為三個戰塲：</p>
<p>第一，是以臨沂為中心，東起海邊，西至臨棗（津浦路以東）的主戰塲。共軍在這裏集結着十五個師，兩個獨立旅，兩個縱隊，合約二十萬人。</p>
<p>第二，為自膠濟路淄博支綫南下萊蕪新泰，以蒙陰為目標以鉗攻臨沂之背的第一支戰塲，共軍在這裏配合着三個師，兩個警備旅，兩個獨立團，合的五萬人。</p>
<p>第三，為以津浦路以西，隴海路徐汴段向北，黃河以南的第二支戰塲。共軍在這方面集結着五個縱隊，一個獨立旅，合約六萬人。此外，在可以威脅國軍第一支戰塲後側的膠東，共軍駐守着七萬人，魯北駐守着五萬人，以上合計，整個山東境內的共軍正規軍，其總數已達四十三萬人。自稱有一百二十萬正規軍的共黨，今天已以其三分之一以上的本錢，運用在山東戰場上，以作孤注一擲了。</p>
<p>至於國軍方面的兵力，其數字或較共軍為略低，惟有一點是相同的，即雙方都以主力安排在魯南正面的主戰塲上。國軍的初步攻擊目標為臨沂，共軍最初所以發動徐州會戰，其戰略意圖亦在以攻勢防禦確保臨沂。臨沂為什麼値得國軍成為主力進攻的目標？臨沂又為什麼値得共軍以最大的兵力來確保？對於臨沂的重要性，在這裏似乎不得不補上一段插話</p>
<p>王耀武將軍在魯南前綫</p>
<p>臨沂重要性　僅次於延安　而高於佳木斯</p>
<p>臨沂是魯南重鎭，在兵要地理上具有最重大的價値。遠在民國廿七年抗日戰役，國車台兒莊大捷，苜先就得力於故上將張自忠在臨沂一役的勝利。此次共軍發動徐州會戰，其左翼兵團陳毅粟裕所部，亦即以臨沂，為其最大根據地。加以臨沂近年早為中共三大根據地之一。（其餘一為延安，一為東北的佳木斯）是共軍第二支強大部隊新四軍的根據地，也是中共華東局和偽山東省政府及山東軍區的所在地。要言之，是大河以南，大江以北，中共的黨政軍的中心，是延安以東中共最主要的根據地，其對中共的重要性，僅决於延安而高於佳木斯，因此共軍對臨沂之得失，列論就軍事的意義或政治的意義言，其重大遠超過蘇北及張家口，更遠超過去年四五月四平街及長春之役的得失。因此，臨沂便成了共軍勢所必守，而國軍為着擊破其主力，也就「攻其所必守」，大會戰於是展開了！</p>
<p>戰事到目前，還在激劇地進行着，自本月十二日以來，國軍已進至南距臨沂四十五華里的李家莊，臨沂城內各機關都已北遷，所有共軍也已撤至兩側山地，臨沂城早就成了一座空城，因此，國軍一邊進駐城垣，一邊將兩側山地共軍肅淸。共軍的初步失敗，亦為命運所注定。但是，目下所紫繞在國人心頭的，已不再是臨沂的收復問題而是共軍於退出臨沂後將何去何從的問題？國軍於進佔臨沂後更將何去何從？魯南會戰到什麼時候可以結束？</p>
<h3>國軍收復臨沂後　戰事將如何繼續進行？</h3>
<p>關於前者，在魯南包圍圈中的共軍原可有下列四種行動：（一）逃避山地，（二）退竄膠東，（三）穿越津浦與劉伯誠黃河北岸一股合流，（四）回竄蘇北。四者之中，原以第一項可能性為最大，但自北路國軍於四日收復萊蕪，八日進佔新泰，突入沂蒙山區心臟後，其逃避山區的企圖已不得不頻增顧慮。共軍週前集中主力向郝鵬舉部猛攻，雖又佔得若十小便宜，但經國軍側擊，自此回竄蘇北的迷夢顯又粉碎。（但其相機出擊，以奪取國軍武器，俾為擴充其武裝的資本的道個目的顯已部份達成）。至退竄膠東，則如老鼠鑽入牛角，只可苟安一時，非至萬不得已，共軍決不出此。至穿越津浦橫渡黃河與劉伯誠股合流，自亦當於主觀上認為在沂蒙及泰山山區裟已予國軍以若干損失，客觀上被國軍三面園剿得再也無法立足時，才會出此一策。因此，就戰事演變情勢看，沂蒙及泰山山區裏可能還有一塲大惡戰，臨沂的攻佔，只是魯南會戰的一個序幕曲至多是吿一段落，而不是閉幕禮。</p>
<p>至於國軍於攻佔臨沂後將如何繼續進行戰事，依據有資格軍事觀察家分析結果，當不出下列三個方案：（一）隨着共軍主力的去向來決定，不在一城一地之得失，而主要的在捕捉其主力而殲滅之。這與共軍的保存實力，避免決戰的戰略基本原則，恰正相反。（二）於收復臨沂稍事整補後繼續以主力北上，與新泰南下國軍會師於蒙陰，將共軍沂蒙根據地支解為二，然後向兩翼席捲配合魯西北上國軍完成兩包團圈而殲滅之。（三）採取大包圍策略，國軍於臨沂方面，僅留一支足以阻遏共軍南竄及牽制共軍他調的兵力而改以主力調至魯西，利用魯西千里沃野，平原一片，旣利行軍，又便補給，首將劉伯誠部主力擊潰，並趕向黃河以北或津浦路以東的沂蒙山區及泰山山區，使與陳毅合流，如此津浦路徐濟段打通後，由三面壓迫，逐漸將包圍圈縮小。再將共軍殲滅。這三個方案可　同時被採用，問題的焦點只在主力，也就是主戰塲的是否更易而己。</p>
<h3>魯南會戰何時結束？　徐濟段何時可打通？</h3>
<p>假使有人一定要問魯南會戰還需要多久始能結束？這完全全要看變方的兵力是否再在增加及雙方對於作戰指導，戰略運用，及戰術戰鬥的進行如何以為斷。假使國軍不在迫切捕捉共軍主力，而首要的希望是恢復津浦路徐濟段，那末如循上述第三方案進行，應該可以不超出三個月。至於膠濟路的災難，正相反地，恐將隨着魯南會戰的加劇而益加深，因此，濟南由陸上與外邊的聯絡，亦可能隨時被切斷，但這只是說明它可能成為孤城，但絕不致成為長春第二。肩負着這個最沉重祖子的王司令官耀武，正以最高的知　，最大的努力，和最深的毅力，運用這最有限的兵力，來應付當前的局勢。</p>
<h3>法蘭西　增產計劃</h3>
<p>— 馬黎四日航訊　本報特約記者宏負</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰旣吿終，各國鑒於時代之需求，銳意加大生產之效率，俄國五年計畫，即其一種例證。法國時代化生產委員會主席芒納Jean　Monnet，最近發表革新生產方法之偉畫，須以七年或八年之功，完成自力更生之期望，蓋一國之經濟生活，無異一家或一人，法國在戰前，譬如一富戶，可藉投資外國而生利度日，彼時法國一切生產事業，堪藉國外存款所得利潤以資應付今則戰債山積，法方存於外國之款，均須抵償戰時得諸外國之軍用消耗，譬如一家或一人，由富變貧，四顧無所憑藉，惟有工作，方可生存，惟賴本國努力生產，方可取其所盈益，以用諸生產事業，此則法國生產必須迅即加大之原因。</p>
<p>法國工農兩方面之工作能率，向比他國為低，戰前一名法國工人之生產力，比諸訓練佳而營養足之一名美國工人，僅及其三分之一，比諸一名英國工人，僅及其三分之二，且自世界大戰發生，法國全部生產力之三分一，已歸靜止，而今新式工作計畫之實行，不僅代以新式之工具，又必採用最精良之新法式，此計畫之第一要圖，為使戰期淪毀部分，迅即重造，而允重者，為使生產數額，比戰前大加特加。</p>
<p>重工業於革新生產之圖，特占重要地位，一國若無重工業，永不能自憑軍備以長保安全，軍備之擔負，誠哉不宜過高，而生產能力，却不可不及時加大，重工業生今之世，苟不銳進，自必速退，苟不即使時代化，自不免向下崩潰，今照謨贊計畫預定之程序，則如煤電鋼生鐵火車貨車造船廠等重工業，法國至一九四七年底，必須達到等於一九三八年度生產情况之水平綫，其後如一九四八年之中半，必須上躋一九二九所已至之最高點，而比一九三八年之水平綫，已加百分之二十五，若至一九五〇年，尙須比照一九二九年全盛期之最高點，再加百分之二十五，預許法於一九五〇年，已須造成四十七萬五千部之汽車，所需汽油，為額至鉅，同時並須建立往還於海面之油庫艦隊，敷設北起海灣LeHavre港南達巴黎之石油輸送管，他如農收生產，隨之傳令激增，其農產品增產方式，略如下表：</p>
<p>觀乎右表小麥白暮甜根欄，較小於前之地積，反可有較大於前之收獲，憬然於激增農產者之不容忽視新式耕種法，我華則農事待興，水利尤為當務之急，足衣足食之謀，必先之以裕農防水，先進國良規具在，堪資取法者正多。</p>
<p>法本優於自給，今者國旣由富而貧，國人自須如覓工糊口之擊，級勞力以謀生，預計一九四七年年底，法國進行此計畫所需工役，已達四十八萬名，此後三年所應遞加之工役二十二萬名，未曾遣送離法之戰俘五十萬名，三項合計，至一九五〇年為止，已須有一百二十萬人上工，此計書旣見實施，則法全境之勞工市塲，即須加以嚴密之管制，勿任無專職之人，私營他種事業以逃工，若人數尙感不足，自須加人女工，同時又須徵及入居法境之外國移民，此指每星期西十八小時制而言，此後如更採用新制，改為每星期上工四十四小時者，聞須再行添覓五十萬之工人，方足敷用，今法國之有待外國輸入者，除必不可免之日用品外，即為用以加大生產之機器與工具，計目一九四七年至一九五〇年之四年間，投諸變布此新工業之經費，的三百萬億佛郎，此正等於今法政府一年國庫收入之全數，此可於此後四年，陸續籌措，但如確己用新法加大生產，一九五〇年度之國旅收入，即可增為三百七十萬億之佛郎，茲將各門事業分別投資之估計，列表如下：隷屬於此委員會者，有十八部門之小組委員會，預就各項專門問題，分任研究，以其所得，付總會裁核施行，綱舉目張，有條不紊，右表所估計之投資數額，須其幣價與物價安定於一水平綫上，而無漲落遷變之發生，又須無共產分子，從中引起怠工罷工等糾紛，方可按步就班而日進向上。世間苦樂，每相循環，國至於貧人民恒須用其勞力，以盡國民一分子義務，法國人之氣質如華人，遇有甚大之難關，未嘗不猛將如雲而謀臣如雨，有時或尙不能穩操勝算，病在人心之不易齊也。</p>

<p>修理水管派費質疑</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>鄙人居住本市祟德路一二五弄，本月十二日起，全弄居戶，即覺自來水供應不暢，十四日竟全部斷絕，後知有工人在馬路中掘土修理，總水管已腐裂，至十五日工竣後，仍無滴水。忽有人挨戶謂巳與自來水公司談妥，本弄應付國幣一百二十餘萬，每戶實攤四萬餘元，並謂延期付款則斷絕水源，鄙人家屬照付後，僅給一私人收據，查公司修理馬路總水管費用是否應由近段用戶負祖，如果有此規例，亦理應直接派員出據收款。何以需先付款後放水，如此難免宵小借端敲詐，徒開勒索之門，因請法商水電公司調查公佈，以釋羣疑，（祟德路阿成）</p>
<p>减少電車擁一議編輯先生：</p>
<p>現在滬市人口已較戰前增多，但全市電車車輛之數，未能添加，故每站乘客上下十分擁擠，鄙人以為倘將現有電車車首一門，一律專為乘客上車之用，車尾一門，專供乘客下車，如是則可减少擁擠程度，並可節省每站車停時間。至於拖車，因扯門闊度，已較廣大，能容二人並上或二人並下，尙可照舊，在電車車輛不能增加之時，是法輕而易舉，務望有關當局令英法兩商電車公司試行。（汪盛松）</p>
<h3>鐵路機車車皮缺乏　東北交通亟待恢復　瀋陽十二日航訊</h3>
<p>— 本報駐瀋記者趙展</p>
<p>東北鐵路交通，去冬因煤荒與嚴寒，幾陷於凍結的狀態之下。目前春天就要到來了，交通是否有改善的希望，這問題當為大衆所矚目。煤的問題，似已不如冬天之嚴重，但因產量之不濟，也並非全無問題，而最大的問題，是鐵路機車及車皮十分缺乏。現有之數量，不及光復前的十分之一。</p>
<p>光復前，全東北鐵路原有機車四千台，現剩三台。原有客車廂五千輛，現剩二百五十餘輛。原有貨車廂四萬輛，現剩五千輛，僅三千輛能用。現存的機車，大都殘破不堪，行車效率很低</p>
<p>據交通界人士談：因東北鐵路損失最大，加以共軍不時破壞，妥恢復先前之運輸能力，不是很容易的事，似非三五年不辦。根據路局公佈：截至目前止，東北區國有鐵路經國軍接收者，四千二百七十四公里，己修復通車者，三千二百四十九公里。東北鐵路原有一萬一千餘公里，目前通車者，僅及光復前的三分之一强</p>
<p>關於解決機車及車廂缺乏問題，近聞行總已允予撥給機車五十台，車廂八百輛。惟何時運到，尙無確期。如此批機車運到，對運輸不無小補，因目前貨運之亟待恢待，而交通問題之嚴重因此而益增。</p>
<h3>漲風在廣州　經濟緊急措施下　混亂局面趨平定</h3>
<p>— 廣州十二日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>這幾天來，由於黃金外幣像無羈野馬一樣奔騰，糧價也隨着時鐘上的分針進行而昇漲，其他物價也因此影響而步步高升；這「漲呀！漲呀！」的聲浪，壓迫着廣州百多萬市民幾乎至於窒息。他們彷彿像駕了一葉輕舟在茫茫大海裏浮沉着一樣，再遭遇到一塲無情的暴風雨降臨，更不知何處是岸了！的確，現在恐怖的空氣正籠罩着全城，市民們看着物價的瘋狂的暴跳，無不阻戰心驚；走在街頭上的人們，一張張蒼白的臉孔帶着慌張的神色；到處都可以聽到互相訴苦的哀鳴；這混亂的情形，委實是廣州復員後所未有的現象。</p>
<p>作為廣州金融市塲的十三行，彷彿成了決定百多萬市民命運的地方。這幾天來。眞是空前未有的緊張和熟鬧，終日萬頭攢動，擠去擠來；就平日對金融漲落最不感興趣的人們，這兩天也到那兒去聽聽消息，看看行情，因為這市塲的動態，會直接地影響到每個人的生活的呀！所以全市市民的目光，都不期然集中到十三行路上去。可是人們對這金融市塲愈加注意，看着黃金外幣的瘋狂騰漲，人心便愈加浮動得厲害；各商行稍存資金的，者紛紛搶購黃金外幣存儲，就一般人也決不會留着那一分鐘比一分鐘貶値的國幣吧！於是搶呀！搶呀！全十三行的黃金外幣都給人搶購光了，再加上一些投機份子推波助瀾，大量的收進而不放出，那怎會有不狂漲的道理呢？我們先看看上週的價格：黃金最高不過五十四萬，港幣祗一五〇〇，可是到了二月十一日那天，黃金竟漲至一百四十萬，港幣最高會達三五〇〇，相距不過一週間，在漲竟達百分之、一百三十以上；尤其在二月十，十一兩天，黃金外幣每天跳躍達十餘萬元。同時糧價亦被牽起，而且進展的速度，更有過之而無不及，從每祖五萬銳進至最高達二十八萬，米店老關還不大願意賣出；其他日用必需品，當然也就亦步亦趨；在這樣激烈變化的混亂狀態之下，怎不使人發抖呵？</p>
<p>在金融激動百物狂漲聲中，廣州的工商業所受打擊至大，大部份幾陷於停頓狀態。因金融瞬息萬變，無從捉摸，各行商業，買賈都感困難；存貨碼？又缺乏資金轉流；將貨拋出吧！存着國幣又會貶値；因此週來各項貨物成交甚少。而有關工業性質的，則受害更慘；因各項工業原料飛漲，出品成本自然增高，工廠製造品出售後，每每不足塡補原料價値；再加上有數行業，工人亦鬧着加資風潮，在工人方面，因受生活高漲影響，要求加薪自不能稱不合理，但廠方亦多數實在無從負担，在這樣情形之下，那祗有關門大大吉了！祇說本市的權膠廠，至目前上已倒閉了三十多家其數佔全市膠廠三分之一；就其他工業亦多進備結束，如在短期內沒有一個轉機，那廣州的工商業前途，恐更不堪設想了！</p>
<p>不多日子以前，廣州的公共汽車經過調整改革以後，已煥然一新，市民稱便，這是一個佳訊；可是近幾天來，情形又不同了！全市的公共汽車由局部停駛而幾至全部停駛了！原因不用說也就是由於金融波動所致。</p>
<p>除了工商業以外，因這次物價狂漲風潮影響，廣州的文化事業，也臨着破產的階段了！先從報業去看吧！自從宣佈限制洋紙進口，增加洋紙稅後，洋紙價格即呈暴漲，再加上外幣飛騰，洋紙便越漲越兇；未及半月白報紙從每令（五百大張）三萬多元而漲達二十萬元，相差六倍以上；同時印刷技工也在這時要求加薪百分之一百强，跟着還有米價和其也物料的上漲哩，而報紙的價格究竟不能和其他物品相比遽增，廣吿費在工商業面臨厄運的時候而加得太厲害；現在出兩張的大光，越華，國華，商報等報，每份已定價五百元，其餘出一張半紙的，也售四百元，但報價依然不能追上其他物價，這使報館的負責人們，大感無法支持了！最近停版的已有大華日報，天行報，英文新報等三家，恐怕在這一星期內，還有幾家熬不住哩！其他如書店，印刷業等，亦由於紙價，米價及工資過昂，幾至全部亭頓了！，就算學校吧！在這個春季期間，各級學樣舊生停學者多，新生投考者甚少，這固然是其中因私立學校收費過高，但主要的恐怕還是在於人民生活過於困難吧！所以綜觀廣州文化事業的前途，眞是一重黑幕哩！</p>
<p>總之，廣州在這幾天來，金融空前的動盪，工商業被壓粉碎，文化事業瀕於危境，人心萬分驚惶，社會上到處危機四伏，這都是不可諱言的事實；難道就讓它這樣發展下去嗎？問題就是在當局措施的辦法和力量。我們大家都知道這次的物價在狂漲是由於金融波動而影響、而金融的波動一部份是受着外地波動的牽動，但地方上的金融投機份子故意掀風作浪使人歧視國幣也是一主要原因。所以常局祗要能拿出力量制止這班投機家的活動，使金融平穩，一切問題當可迎刃而解。我們看吧：自從昨（十一）日省府頒行緊急措施，勒令外幣黃金一律停止買賣並禁止各錢銀業店簽發之本票銀單發行及流通，以及黃金白銀禁止出口，所有一切買賣交易訂立契的，不得以黃金外幣為本位，並訂定各種嚴厲處罰辦法；同時對糧食方面：行轅與省府亦曾會商決定糧食緊急措施辦法：（一）限令廣州零售米商照價售糧，違者嚴辦；（二）廣州米巿實施議價，供應零售商；（三）廣州殻關實施議價供應米商及批發商；（四）限定各縣以大量榖米運廣州濟銷。這些命令頒行之後，馬上便起了很大的反應；黃金即時下瀉，港幣亦回跌，米糧更下降。這都足顯示出當局的力量。但目前黃金外幣與米糧價格，雖已下降，可是比起此次漲風前還是上升一倍以上，以至人民生活困苦尙未能大部份解除，社會亦未回復安定狀態，這當然有望於當局的更大努力！</p>
<h3>揚子江流域　農田水利　（上）</h3>
<p>— 孫輔世</p>
<p>山谷及傾斜地農田，水源得自天然之河流（必要時輔以塘水），且因其坡降較陡，得利用以引水入田，其方法有二</p>
<p>（一）堰渠</p>
<p>其法為攔河築堰，截河流之一部份或其全部，引渠流至田間。此項堰渠引水灌田之方法，以引用岷江灌漑成都平原之都江堰為巨擘，次之則為漢江上游各支琉之漢中灌漑區域；其餘湘贛部皖南浙西一帶，亦極普遍。</p>
<p>（二）筒車</p>
<p>其法為攔河築堰，抬高水頭，靠河岸留一水道，而安設筒車，籍水力之衝動，推轉筒車，以汲水灌田。最適於沿靠急流，而範圍不廣之農田。</p>
<p>筒車之製以竹為輪，其徑自二三丈至六七丈，視汲水之高度為準。輪周安設翼板及竹筒歡十個，每筒容水之量半升至四分之三升，輪翼為水力所冲而轉動。輸週之筒汲水而上，至最高處瀉水於一木漕內，流至田間。其構造殊甚簡單材料以竹木為主，無金屬附件。</p>
<p>筒車在川，黔，桂北，湘西，陝南，均極普遍。</p>
<p>（三）塘田</p>
<p>塘大的畝許，深二三公尺，儲蓄山谷溪澗之水，因滲漏甚微，故水易保存。大者可灌田二一十畝，小者僅灌數畝，安康漢陰一帶，塘田較多，遠望水光連天，遍地盡池也。</p>
<p>漢中灌漑區域最足以代表揚子江流域之山谷及傾余地之農田。其地因秦嶺之隔，無黃河流域之冷旱，土質粘黑，滲漏量小，一切情况，與四川盆地相彷彿，水田遍於域中。其灌漑方法，以堰渠為主，再輔以筒車水塘諸方法。惟雨量較少，全年六百公厘左右，但夏季佔百分之五十以上，漢江本身之水，用以灌漑者甚少。灌漑之利，盡在支流，就最者者言之，則為沔縣之養家河；褒城，南之廉水·褒水·冷水；城固。洋縣之婿水，洋縣之黨水·馬步河。酉水·金水；西鄉之牧馬河·小峽河·法西河·法東河·豐渠河；石泉之池河；漢陰之月河及其支流；安康之恒河及黃洋河；洵洋之壩河。其情况的如下表：</p>

<p>養家河　養家河　水諸堰　共六〇〇〇</p>
<p>共計　二〇八，八六〇畝</p>
<p>上表所記，略擇其大者。其他小堰灌漑均不在內，合計約在三十餘萬畝，連同塘田等當在四十餘萬畝左右也。諸河之中以褒水之堰較為整齊統一。褒城東門外之山河大堰，允為漢中之巨擘，傳為漢蕭何曹參所創。</p>
<p>次於山河堰者，即為湑水河各堰，但其工程則艱苦數倍，每年修理堰費，所耗不資。</p>
<p>漢中區域萬山重疊之處，仍佔大部。人民乃就其澗谷略製坪地，有水可引，則以種稻，無水可引，則種包榖。故其灌漑之地，皆零碎片段，然合而計之，亦頗可觀。洵陽縣灌溉之田有三千六七百畝，就中以洵河之水為利甚多。鎭安灌漑之地有三千餘畝，以洵河及金井河之利較多，乾祐河次之。留壩灌漑之地不及千畝，以武聞河及紫金河為較夥。鳳縣則僅有水田的三百畝，大半皆屬安河之水，至古道河則平衍多沙而乏灌漑之利矣。</p>
<p>為維護堰渠工程，支配灌漑之水量，增加溉田之面積，以堰渠範圍之廣，管理問題，異常重要。瑛中區域，在明代設有通判，專事管理漢中十二縣水利事宜，淸初仍之。嘉慶時設水利廳，由漢中府經歷兼辦，範圍改為南褒，城洋四縣。民國以來，改由各縣政府負責，實際則由人民自行辦理，如有爭執，縣府臨時派員查處，事多生手，又無專責，以致水量支配不均，洞口破壞，渠道淤塞，堤坎殘缺，堰工不整，情狀殊不堪聞問。民國二十三年陝西省府乃設陝南水利管理局於南鄭，管理南，褒，沔，城，洋，西，留，七縣之堰焉。</p>
<p>在陝南區創設之新式堰渠工程計有漢惠，褒惠，婿惠三渠，茲述其大概如左：</p>
<p>漢惠渠自沔縣高家泉引漢口之水，灌溉沔縣褒城及南鄭三縣地十一萬畝。設計始於民國十三年經變亂終止，二十七年重行設計施工，預計工款七十一萬餘元，又因材料購運困難及工款屢吿不繼，工程進行殊緩，後經一再追加，全部工款達一百九十萬元，於三一十年五月完成，區內農田，深蒙其利，農民均額手稱慶焉。</p>
<p>褒惠渠引褒城外黑龍江水灌溉褒城南城等縣地十五萬畝，民國二十八年春開始測量設計，同年九月開工，惟以在抗戰時期，經費·工人·材料·三者，均不應手，延緩期限，迨至三十一年，方始吿成。為陝南河山，增加不少秀麗。</p>
<p>湑惠渠引城固湑水灌漑城固縣農田十五萬畝，二十八年測量，設計亦早即完成，因人力財力之缺乏，未即興工，迨至三十年漢惠渠放水後，成效顯著，農民信仰益堅，經當地士紳聯合請求從速開工，地方當局，亦屢督催，乃於是年九月開始工作。惟進行亦緩，迄今大部工程已竣，並局部放水，今年當可全部竣工矣。</p>

<p>本來像中國這樣一個民生凋零生產落後的國家注重於生產建設之不暇，那裏還顧及得到文化事業？物質的需要還相差十萬八千里，精神糧食沒有不致於殲死！但是我國是一個文明的國家，一方面我們固然要在經濟政治方面求人民生活基層的穩固，同時另一方面也不能不樹立敎育文化事業以至於上層的精神建設。</p>
<p>本月十二日經濟部王雲五部長有一段談話，他說：「英國目前對出版報紙書籍尙管制甚嚴，必須政府核准始可出版。目前我國報紙競爭擴大篇幅，且各黃色書報，本無出版之必要，故有限制紙張之措施。」讀後我們倒覺很頗有一些懷疑的地方。第一，我們不知道中國的出版事業有沒有英國那樣發達？第二，我們下知道在中國道樣一個敎育文化水準較低的國家是否不需要鼓勵人民閱報讀書？第三，報紙競爭擴大篇幅是不是一個壞現象而政府必須加以限制？第四，限制紙張能否即限制不必要出版的黃色刋物？</p>
<p>我們以爲這時候政府不應該再限制正當的出版事業，相反的，應該鼓勵它，應該積極的帮助它。鼓勵和帮助的辦法還是請政府對於正當的出版家放出足够運用而手續箱捷的貸款。在根本方面常然還是如王部長所說的發展太國的造紙工業。下過怎樣切實去發展造紙工業也還是需要政府能够積極的予以輔助。總之，出版事業到了現在僅靠本身的營業是無法支持的，它切盼政府的救助！</p>
<h3>民衆教育新動向</h3>
<p>— 羅庚生</p>
<p>古媒著　中華書局出版</p>
<p>假使你是一個關心中國前途者，或者是一個預備領導民衆的靑年，你不妨看看這本「民衆敎育新動向」。</p>
<p>民衆敎育的興起，動機在救中國。試看我國文盲的衆多，拉住了我們的國家的進步；要創造一個民主的中國，要喚起民衆，必先使民衆識字，有知識，有組織；而現在的學校，那裏能够普遍的敎導一般勞苦階級，於是民衆敎育的興起，是必然的！民衆敎育的重要，民衆敎育的任務與目標，在這本書裏，都有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>其次著者曾指出，假使你要實際地辦一點民衆敎育的事業，那你必須有充分的經費和人才。因爲每一件事業的成就，主要的因素是計劃經費人才三者的配合，最好再能修加上行政的力量，效能可以更大，速率也必定加快。這此民衆敎育的行政組織，人才的來源，社敎經費等問題，都一一加以討論。</p>
<p>其實民衆敎育也可以脫是一種敎育改造事業，需要眞正的實施，單講理論是沒有用的！綜計一切實施民衆敎育的機關，依照它施敎的方式，可以分成三類：</p>
<p>（一）民衆禱習敎育：如民衆學校職業補習學校等，它是給失學民衆，補受基本敎育，淺學者擴充共文化財，更有技能上職業上的敎導。</p>
<p>（二）綜合的民衆敎育；這種施敎方式的機關，包括有民衆敎育館，民衆敎育區，流動敎學等。因爲這種敎育機關，同時實施着多種教育，如民衆敎育館，它除了敎導民衆職字外，還有藝術生計等敎育的設施。</p>
<p>（三）分立的民衆敎育；這種施敎繼關，把各種民衆敎育，分立開來，單獨施敎一種。如髖育館，只實施健康敎育，科學館只實施民衆科學敎育。</p>
<p>科學的發達，事實的需要，民衆敎育更有下面幾種新的發展</p>
<p>（一）因爲要减少民衆的消費，增加民衆的收入，於是有各種合作社設立。合作社的設立，能改善民衆的生活，民生安定，才能定心求學，所以合作事業，對於民衆敎育，間接地有很大的帮助</p>
<p>（二）衛生敎育和健康敎育：我國民衆的身體，大半很是孱弱，不注意衛生，生了病又不會醫，要使民强，衛生和健康的敎育，也是一件很重要的實施。</p>
<p>（三）自衛訓練和公民訓練：消極方面是自衛，積極方面是自治與建設，也就是組織民衆。</p>
<p>（四）電影播音敎育（電化敎育）：電影與播音，感化民衆的力量很大，是目前敎育當局所要積極推行的。</p>
<p>其他如戲劇，歌唱，家庭敎育，兒意保育等，以前很少有人注意，而現在都變成了民衆敎育的新設施。</p>
<p>民主的潮流在奔騰，民主的國家在建設，中國的民衆敎育，正配合着這個時代的需要，向着提高民族文化，安定民生，發揚民權的途境邁進！</p>
<h3>向地理教師們介紹　學生地理暗射圖</h3>
<p>— 又雲</p>
<p>中國史地圖表編纂社編繤　亞不與地學社出版</p>
<p>報戲某大學地理考試卷裏，有某生答瀋陽是山東省會的笑話，正可反映今天一般人的地理知識是怎探一回事！因此我想將亞光輿地學社最近出版的中國地理及世界地理暗射圖，來作一决介紹。</p>
<p>暗射圖是有地形及符號而沒有地名的地圖，印刷大都比較簡單。它的功用專在給學生作塡寫地名的練習，也有人用做研究各種科學的塡圖，因爲售價較普通地圖低廉，凡是學校及對地理有興趣的個人，都樂於採用，拿來作訓練熟記地名的練習，對於增進地理認識一點，確有極大幫助。但在我國好的暗射圖並不多見，戰後且形絕跡，普通注重地理的學校，都用油印自己印製，但此法旣費時問，內容又多簡陋欠準，難以討好。</p>
<p>大中國圖書局發行的中國及世界地理暗射圖，各爲十六開大小，其裝訂及設計完全一樣，含圖亦各三十幅，內容頗稱新頴，凡第二次大戰後已更改的國界，及國內新設的交通綫，都已收集列人。其顯著的特點約有下列數端：一，省界國界特別加組，以補救單色印刷的不足，使範圍仍顯著。二，水面用水綫表示，使陸海醒目。三，繪製精確淸楚，加添讀者的快感。四，印刷及紙張，較曾有的暗射圖爲優。但各圖的比例不統一，學者比較而積，似稍困難。岡的售價已很大衆化，幾乎人人可買，但另印白報紙本，使學者以更低的代價，來作多次練習，似更需要。</p>
<p>加强自己地理的基礎，最好能多用暗射圖來練習。</p>
<h3>「梅墅集」讀後</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>王次清著　中華書局仿宋版</p>
<p>梁溪王次淸先生，雖然生長在世族的家庭，可是秉性超脫，獨愛好文藝，率眞流利，別具一番淡泊的風度。國學犬師唐蔚芝先生稱他爲自然派的田園詩文，可和東晋陶淵明的詩文，遙相脗合我們看過了王先生的詩女之後，大家都許爲知言。最近中華書局把他平生所有的詩詞文稿整理為梅墅集，用仿宋文版發行，無疑給愛好國粹的人們，一秤美好的精神食糧。全部分爲三卷，第一卷爲杏雨樓詩鈔，其中五古七古，非常典雅，襟懷意氣，無異乎澛蕩的春風，縱橫的秋水。</p>
<p>「會心在物外，溸心願耕釣，軒冕非所榮，箕頴自同調。」</p>
<p>「榮利非合願，素懷甘淡泊，避世得養眞，高舉企雲鶴。」</p>
<p>看這些詩，超然物外，節直和陶淵明的「采菊東離下，悠然見南山」的名句，可以古今相映。第二卷梨雲館詞鈔，有問月亭，黃鶴樓諸關，雄壯瑰麗，兼有辛稼軒，蘇子瞻兩家的氣槪。第三卷爲適園文存，都是訊游寫景的作品，無論高山，曠野，板橋，流水，多納之於小篇短幅中，堪和柳子厚的永州八記相參看。其中也有激昂慷慨憂世憂時的詩文，楊鍾鈺先生評爲岳武穆的白頭吟，文文山的正氣歌，並不是阿私之言。顧一樵先生在梅墅集跋語，搜集了很多史料，介紹作者的身世，有本有源，頭頭是道，至於文筆的雋永，立論的精透，彷彿是史漢的世家文章，更足增加閱者的興趣。</p>
<h3>出版消息</h3>
<p>李石曾先生主辦之世界半月刋近改爲月刋，該刋第六期內容有李石曾之世界與中國之台灣觀」，沈靜之「美國援華政策」，徐開墅之「論憲法中之中央制度」，利文之「黃金風潮之起伏」等文，聞內容精采，銷路甚廣云。</p>
<h3>讀黛絲姑娘</h3>
<p>— 彭行才</p>
<p>英國哈代（Thomas　Hardy）原著　呂天石譯　正風出版社發行</p>
<p>英國小親家哈代在中國讀者的面前並不是一個陌生的名字，十年前，我就讀過他的「還鄉」和「德伯家的太絲」；（即黛絲姑娘）我陶醉在那委婉而富有詩意的情飾中，我爲了黛絲的不幸遭遇，始終感到有一種不可彌補的遺憾！</p>
<p>最近，我又重新翻開呂天石的譯木，在百忙中總算讀完了，當我合起書來，閉起眼睛，那一幅幅的圖畫，那悲慘流血的印象，始終　擾着我的安寗，心中好像抑鬱着一種說不出的難過，爲了黛絲的不幸，我忍着那一聲將要脫口而出的嘆息；我覺得作者對待黛絲太不公平了。</p>
<p>作者替黛絲安排了一種無法逃脫的命運；她掙扎，她呼喊！終於逃不了那悲慘的結果，像希臘悲劇中的阿狄甫士王子一樣，你逃吧？命運之神在等着你呢</p>
<p>一個純潔無疵的孩子，她有什麼罪過？她的「錯一，並不是自己造成的，別人的罪孽爲什麼要加在她身上？她有的是同情和良心，她有的是溫柔和熱情。「她不忍傷害一個蠅子和一條小虫，甚至看了一隻小鳥在籠子裏也要替它流淚。」她太不幸了，她能够忍受克萊爾的遺棄，她實在不能忍受亞力山大死命的誘感和追逐。克萊爾對她太刻薄了，一隻小綿羊也會發怒的。她嘶啞着嗓子在向＼正義呼喊！</p>
<p>她忍受不了克萊爾給她的失望，不忍心親眼看見自己寡母和弟弟妹妹們活活餓死，她才答應和亞力山大同居的，如果說這是她意志薄弱的地方，那麽哈代早已說過，她是在意志薄弱的氣候環境中生長的，那些一顚倒乖戾的事蹟，作者好像認爲是極自然的發展，那些因襲的社會遺傳性向，以及在司蒂芬王朝時代，那些穿盔甲的她的祖宗所造成的罪孽，爲什麽要報應在她身上？杜百維家嚴人的馬車數輛，為什么在黛絲身上重演呢？</p>
<p>依照作者的解釋，好像人生中　　　　一種一定命，冥冥之中，自然有個主宰，這是人類所不能抗拒的。常黛絲被捕後，作者說「正義是彰明了」，萬神宰的主也終止玩弄黛絲了。」</p>
<p>作者太悲觀了，太相信命運了，爲什麼不鼓勵讀者積極的去追求「生」呢，一定要說「我願意我」沒有生——土在那邊或是別的地方。」「這活着的痛苦是嚴重的。」</p>
<p>如果作者把黛絲的不幸遭遇，不是建築在命運的支配上，而是因爲社會制度的問題，特別强調在當時的社會中，不容納一個不是因爲自己所造成的過錯的女孩子的存在；鄰人的唾罵，社會的排擠，道德的的苛求，如果這樣，黛絲的悲劇是個富有社會性的問題，不僅僅是黛絲個人的問題，而是世界上更多更多遭受着黛絲同樣不幸的人的悲劇。</p>
<p>除此之外，在人物和景的描摹上，以及結構的嚴緊，佈局的縝密，是當時小說家所不及的。正如譯者在序中所說「哈代的小說，如一個完整約有機物，內客各部如佈局，對話，人物和景界，都配置得宜，有如一所各部勻稱的偉大建築。」這是的確的，在他所造成的定命論中，那些不可能的事情，以及生硬的「巧合」，他都事先安、配了一個必然的理由，使這故事的發展，更趨於自然。</p>
<p>舉例來說：當黛絲在牀屈基工作的時候，在一個星期六的傍晚她一個人到獵城去遊玩，（在當時是一種風氣，她曾經去了好幾次。）她以爲在街上可以碰到同伴陪她回來的，可是偏偏聯到亞力山大，他自願要做她的同伴，她拒絕了，寗願耐心的等待那些瘋狂的人們跳究了舞才一道回家，不巧在路上，她和「鏟脾皇后」發生口角，因爲黛絲說了一句傷衆的話，被全體同伴所攻擊，她孤獨的受人責罵，諷刺，戲謔，這時亞力山大騎着馬來了，他說「跳到上面來！坐在我背後，我們立刻可以離開這一羣呌號的女人」。</p>
<p>她因爲十分感到目前的危機，如果在另一個時期，她一定拒絕他的。可是剛剛在這危機的時候，他來邀她上馬，祗要舉足之勞，就可以把她對於這些仇敵的恐懼和恨怒消滅。所以她才不顧一切的跳上馬鞍。等到那些好鬥酒色之徒知道了，他們已經跑到很遠的灰色薄霧裏去了。</p>
<p>在這種種情形下，她的失節似乎是必然的，一點也不覺得勉强；一種不可能的事情，在哈代的筆下也安排得非常合理。</p>
<p>哈代所描寫的景物，和她所描慕的人物有同等的價値，景物在「黛絲姑娘」中，不僅是一種裝飾的背景，面是一種悲慘的或是喜悅的氣氛的烘托，花草，樹木，風雨，黃昏都有它的特性，這種特性可以影響人物心理的改變，「在那個星光燦爛的夜裏，突然起了一種大風，黛絲便覺得這種風是一個極悲慘人的嘆息。</p>
<p>當黛絲叙述她失節的故事的時候，「房裏一切的東西，似乎都爲她面變色，爐底鐵格子上的灰火現出陰崇面非常奇怪的神色，好像一點也不顧及她的困難，爐關子優游消閑的擺出冷笑面孔，好像也不顧到她的窘迫，水瓶子忙着閃光，四週的物件都再三宣吿它們毫無責任，但是自從他吻了她一下之後，什麽也沒有改變，更可以說各樣東西的本體毫無變動，不過這些東西的精神已經改變了。」</p>
<p>克萊爾聽完了她的故事，並不因爲她那細微悠怨的聲音而饒恕她，他認爲她是一個粗俗缺少靈性的女人，預備馬上和他分離，在這時候，哈代寫着；「他悄然走出房問，他在吃飯的時候所斟的兩杯酒——一杯爲黛絲，一杯爲了他自己——仍然放在桌上沒有喝，這就是他倆人吃他們「愛」餐的結果；在兩三點鐘以前，他們由於一時的衝動還同暍一杯茶呢。」</p>
<p>黛絲的幸福是隨着她的故事而消逝了，在二個鐘頭以前，黛絲還浸在一種甜蜜的夢中，誰知道在二點鐘以後，一切都好像葬在流水中了；這兩杯酒就是一種有力的諷刺，帶着譏誚和同情，使讀者更深湛的體味到黛絲，可憐的境遇。</p>
<p>其實在「黛絲姑娘」中，我們看出作者的悲觀思想，並不是對人的厭憎，或是受什麽極大的刺激和失望。他所描寫宇　問的一切，都具有同情心。他愛鳥獸，他愛受傷的野鷄，更愛整個的人類。在他的筆下都是一些可憐的値得同情的人物，約翰杜百維·玉安克萊爾。馬利安。黛絲。葉絲。愛機。甚至亞力山大。哈代都同情他們，都是用眼淚把他們孕育出來的。</p>

<h3>徵求圖案畫</h3>
<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>某化裝品公司在各大報上登出這樣的廣吿：</p>
<p>「本公司發行面霜一種，行銷多年，有口皆碑，茲爲推廣業務改良裝璜起見，懸賞二千萬元，徵求商標，其特性如下：</p>

<p>凡有藝術風味，引人注意，有助業務推廣之圖案，均可應徵。×月×日截止。截稿後聘請專家評定名次，第一名一人將國幣一千萬元，第二名二名，獎三百萬元，第三名五人，各獎一百萬元，第四名五十人，各獎本社××面霜一打……」。</p>
<p>到了截稿的一天，憑着某公司牌子的響亮，面霜的銷路廣大，應徵者果然不少，一共收到來件二千九百九十三份，截稿以後，當然是評定。</p>
<p>在總經理室裏，總經理，廣吿股主任，設計師，和侍立一旁的服務員，他們就組織了一個評定委員會。</p>
<p>廣吿主任把一封封信撕開來，拿出裏面的稿件。</p>
<p>第一件是一個用柔和的綫條構成的女子，頭上身上披了披紗，手裏拿一球花，旁邊是幾個彎彎曲曲的美術字，有些像霓虹燈上用的。</p>
<p>「不好不好」。總經理說。</p>
<p>第二件是一張鵝蛋臉，半面塗白了，半面還是暗的，鬈髮，臉廓都柔和得沒有一個折痕，一只長瘦得可怕的手，正在臉上搽面霜。圖上是兩個大紅的字又方又硬。</p>
<p>「更不行！」</p>
<p>第三件只是幾支小花，枝葉圍成了圖框，幾個「藝術」得認都不認得的一字，下面還有簽名式的不能認的蟹文。</p>
<p>「沒有刺激，沒有刺激」。總經理狠狠吸了一口雪茄，把芬香的烟噴出來，在許多應徵信上，結成了雲霧。設計師却注目在那三張圖案上，茶役瞪着眼，張了嘴在呆望。</p>
<p>第四張是中間一個紅V字，兩個金色大字，旁邊許多羅馬式的蟹文。」</p>
<p>「八股老套！」</p>
<p>第五張上一只腥紅的嘴……。</p>
<p>「還有些意思。」</p>
<p>第六張只是一只纎手托着瓶面霜……。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>抽出了一張黃底的圖案，繪着一個出浴的女子，長長的鬈髮披在身上，腰間只圍了一條狹中。「有意思，有意思，」總經理忙搶過來，緩緩地抽了口雪加，烟從鼻孔輕輕地飄蕩出來，肥大的頭搖擺着，後頸的縐紋愈發深了。</p>
<p>一兩個字也不差，可惜太板了一點，上次那張花的字倒還好，哈哈…這個女人倒畫得挺不錯，你看兩個乳峯，這個姿勢，簡直好極了！另外的簡直不懂藝術，廣告價値更沒有，這張好，這張好！」</p>
<p>「換幾個字上去吧。」廣吿主任說。</p>
<p>「對另外的也不用看了。」總經理說。</p>
<p>過了幾天，報上又出現了某化裝品公司的啓事。</p>
<p>「…徵求商標圖案，業已評定，茲公佈如下：</p>

<p>有一次幽默大師馬克吐溫拜訪大畫家惠斯勒的畫室，細細鑑賞各幅的畫。後來他想用手去撫摩一張畫布，「喂」，惠斯勒大聲說道：「碰不得！它還沒有乾啊！」</p>

<p>社會局對於上海電影院擅自加價加以歟認，這是出乎例外的。儘管電影院可以准許加價，但在米批准以前，社會局對於電影院藐視法令，擅自採取行動，應該予以嚴正的處罰。</p>
<p>美貨飛漲，各聯合商塲不單生意淸淡，而且存貨稀少。內中人談，美國貨平均都漲了三倍到四倍。</p>

<h3>百貨業老闆說：賣掉了補不進　他們都在看漲！</h3>
<p>— 章文</p>
<p>衖堂口那家百貨店在整理櫥窗，一個伙計在擦玻璃，另一個在更換標價。</p>
<p>我定了進去，大塊頭的老開是素來熟悉的，他正在算賬，把筆唆在嘴喪，手在打算盤。</p>
<p>「到了打烊的時候了嗎？」我問他。</p>
<p>「快了，天氣冷，生意淸，早點打烊算了。」他笑嘻嘻地招呼，抽屜裏摸出一枝大英牌來敬客。我是常來這兒聊天的，老闆很健談。</p>
<p>話題便從米價扯了開去。</p>
<p>「你們開店開行終比我們强，水漲船高怕什麼！」我說。</p>
<p>「咳，老兄！不能這麼說，我們寗願多做做，少瞧賺，生活程度高了，我們開店一開行的人也要吃飯，難道不受影嚮？」</p>
<p>「這是你們做生意的人老生常談，替自己辯辯罷了！」</p>
<p>他急了，嚷着：「那麽，你瞧瞧這幾天我們的生意看！」</p>
<p>生意果然很清談，除了我，沒有半個顧客，而我也不過來　扯來的，並不想「惠顧」什麽東西。日光燈受了寒氣在發抖，照得這三開問的門面更顯得悽慘，看看職員們的臉，菜黃色的皮膚上還籠着一層愁霧，多看了使人想哭。他們不會因漲價高興吧，顧客來了還得陪笑，不然老關要責備的：「吃飽了飯，還要整天哭喪着臉幹嗎？」</p>
<p>記得今年接財神以前，夥友小張担心着怕被裁去，還到我那裏去探過口風，後來裁去的不是他，算是放下了心，會幾何時，又立在積台邊担心寄回家去的錢不够用了。老闆在背後嘰哩咕嚕着「人心不知足」。</p>
<p>爲了冲淡空氣，我轉了話題，隨便問了幾件日用有關的貨品價目。</p>
<p>老關興冲冲地吿訴我，一雙普通可以穿穿的紗襪，現在要買七千多塊，在去年年底祗買三千多塊，還是棉毛衫一類漲得有限，去年底七子的，現在不過九千。</p>
<p>「什麽漲得頂厲害呢！」</p>
<p>「像熱水瓶，去年不過一萬六千，現在要可到三萬二千元，還沒有什麼錢可賺，頂漲得熱昏要算肥皂，去年底買八百元的，現在漲到二千了。」</p>
<p>「你這點存貨可以發財了。」</p>
<p>「咳，賣掉了補不進呀！老兄。」</p>
<p>「那麼，圃着不要賣掉。」</p>
<p>「拿甚麽來給職員們吃呢？」</p>
<p>「借錢！」</p>
<p>「高利貸吃不消。」</p>
<p>話題又回轉來了，我連忙避開問他牙膏和手帕的價錢。</p>
<p>「手帕漲得還好，二千的漲到三千，三星牙膏去年賣八百塊錢，現在二塊，你要買算便宜點好了。」</p>
<p>「我不要買，我要看跌呢」。我打趣說。</p>
<p>他笑了，「從前望天亮，好過生活，現在看來物價要跌，不知等何年何月了」。</p>
<p>我有點不好意思了，問他今天做了多少生意。</p>
<p>「不過四五十萬，你來了這許多時候，看到幾個顧客上門呀。」</p>
<p>我想想，不過二三個人，有的看看就走了。</p>
<p>我也想走了。</p>
<p>老閭客氣地說：「反正沒生意，有空來瞎扯扯」。</p>
<h3>再會吧！生活指數！</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>每個月，我們這些靠生活指數吃飯的職工們，都伸長着頸子，等待指數的「佳音」。</p>
<p>現在，謝天謝地，「生活」從此無「指數」，我們可以無須關心「指數」了。我們不僅贊成這個政策而且歌頌這個德政，因爲，我們並不希望有什麼生活指數，指數是代表物價，生活指數高，不就是物價繼續往上爬麽？我們雖然也希望指數高，但並不希望物價漲呀！換句話說，我們眞的希望物價高嗎？不，絕不！那是被物價高漲所迫，迫不得已才希望「指數增加」來彌補生活而已。如今，「指數」從此「凍結」，我們相信「物價」也從此「凍結」，而且會因此而漸下降；這樣一來，我們小民以後的日子，可以高枕無憂，無所顧慮了。</p>
<p>但是，萬一物價不隨指數凍結而下降，反而增高幾倍，我們永遠以一月份指數計算薪給，呌我們怎樣過活呢？</p>
<p>這兩天物價，除黃金美鈔山央行官價兌換下跌外，其他的東西仍然迷迷惘惘地往上跳。自然，這也許是暫時的狀態，過幾天，一定會好的，我們吃虧也不過幾天，八年都能忍受，何在乎這區區的幾天呢？</p>
<p>因此，我說：再會吧！生活指數，我們從此不需要你了。</p>

<p>中國電影的工作技術低能而貧乏，是不庸諱言的，在財力物力最大限度中力求「精美」，却還少見，老闆們爲成省着節本，歡迎出片的時候，　某些「匠人型」的導演，也就投其所好地馬虎將事，於是「活動連環圖畫」就濫製而充沛市塲。「遙遠的愛」攝製費時半年以上，就全片看來，确是經過一番推敲和磨琢，它樹立了一個優良的風範，値得我們讚揚。</p>
<p>導演的長處是他的細膩和謹愼，但失之於瑣碎，素材的剪接還可以簡練。控制全劇的發展至後半部顯得力量不足，用句術語來說，「有點瀉勁兒」，自余珍和着敎授武漢分手之後，羣演集中力量去表現余珍另一面「廣火的愛」的工作塲而。忽略了以蕭余爲主機的中心事件的更具形的發展，僅用幾次短促會晤是不够的。</p>
<p>演員我覺得趙丹不能令人滿足，他的「戲」是「戲」而已，在人物造型上有商確的必要，尤其是前面部份，爲什把一個大學敎授用一些浮油式的表象的東西裝飾起來呢？那些美國式的小動作，不是一個學者　有的，我覺得趙丹「不客觀的來否定自己的角色」就好了。泰怡有很好的成就，不像以前那樣呆板，但也不見得做作，機素而實在，和趙丹擱在一起剛好是一個明顯的對比。吳茵這個角色好比是一樣菜肴里主要的調味口，故事的進展有賴於她的地方甚多，她也的确盡了這個責任，但表現大姐身份這一點上似乎還可以含蓄點——我是指表演方法，那些嗯嗯啊啊和擺在臉上的老腔，實在不令人感到可親。唐遠之這角色，不知是導演的處理還是他自己的設計，有些不倫不類，尤以他那笑聲，在那樣的塲面出現，使觀衆毛骨悚然地覺得恐怖。</p>
<p>這些都是更苛刻的要求，導演，工作者，演員，在如此低陋的物質條件下完成如此精湛的作品，堪稱中國電影的珍貴收穫，那些僅是美玉瑕疵而已已</p>

<h3>Some State-Run Light Industries Will Gradually Be Changed to Commercial Operations; China Textile Company and Others May Be Offered for Public Sale</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, all state-run production enterprises, except those belonging to the heavy industry sector and those that must be operated by the government due to clearly significant special circumstances, should immediately issue shares to the public or sell them to private merchants, according to the urgency of the situation. It is heard that Song Ziwen recently ordered Wang Yunwu to draft the sales steps within 20 days. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is rushing to formulate a plan. It is heard that there are two major parts of the state-run enterprises belonging to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. One is the China Textile Company, and the other is the China Tobacco Company. The branches of the China Textile Company are spread all over the country, with a total of 1.7 million spindles, and the estimated value of assets is 1 trillion yuan. It is easier to sell some of them that have independent characteristics. For other companies, shares will be issued gradually to increase private capital, so that they will eventually become private companies. Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry, is scheduled to take a train to Shanghai on the evening of the 19th to discuss this matter and other matters related to emergency measures with all relevant parties. In addition, the light industrial factories under the National Resources Commission, including four sugar factories, three paper mills, three electrical appliance factories, and four cement factories, may also issue shares to attract private capital.</p>
<h3>Prices of Public Utilities Will Not Increase Recently</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] When Chairman Chiang made a statement on the 16th, he said: "If the government continues to subsidize various public utilities, the budget cannot be maintained, so reasonable increases should be considered in the future." When a reporter asked relevant parties about this, they stated that the subsidy policy adopted in the past did reduce the burden on those who enjoy public utilities, but it is unfair to reduce the burden on a part of the people with the money paid by the entire nation to the national treasury. Therefore, it is reasonable for the government to reduce subsidies in order to balance the budget. As for the prices of general public utilities, although the authorities are considering making reasonable adjustments, they will not be realized in the very short term, and the amount of increase in the future will not be too large.</p>

About 20 legislators attended, chaired by Luo Ding. Because what the National Government submitted was only the detailed rules for punishing those who violated the plan, not the entire plan, the committee members believed that this would involve the rights, obligations, and freedoms of the people, and should be handled with caution. It was resolved that Luo Ding would report on the progress at the 315th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan on the 20th. In addition, the Legislative Yuan has invited President Song Ziwen to report to the Yuan during the plenary sessions on the 20th and 21st.</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Accuses Soviet Union of Aiding Communists; Moscow Radio Also Criticizes United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The Howard newspaper today published a report by its Shanghai correspondent, Newton, which listed 30 examples accusing the Soviet Union of providing military supplies to the Chinese Communists last year, most of which were captured from the Japanese army. Newton claimed that, according to information he obtained from the Chinese side, the Soviet Union handed over to the Chinese Communists in the Northeast at least 48 Japanese aircraft, 17 tanks, and a number of artillery pieces.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Moscow Radio commentator Osipov today also accused the continued stationing of American troops in China and other countries as "militaristic imperialism."</p>
<h3>American May Continue to Supply Materials Stipulated in Lend-Lease Act; Ambassador Gu's Speech Urges Increased Aid to China</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 18th] According to people close to the American government, Congress is expected to pass a bill on Monday allowing the government to continue supplying China and other countries with materials stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act to help their economic stability and complete reconstruction. In addition to China, there are also four countries: Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Australia.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun delivered a speech at the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Conference tonight, believing that Chairman Chiang will definitely be able to save China's economic crisis, and that the Chinese people and those related to China's economy will work together to achieve the expected results. He also called on the United States to increase its aid to China. His speech briefly stated: China, like other countries, has received financial assistance from the United States after the war, but the amount is limited. Apart from the UNRRA relief supplies, China has only received a loan of 143 million US dollars, while Britain has received 4.4 billion US dollars, and France 2.42 billion US dollars. The Chinese government needs at least 2 billion US dollars for post-war reconstruction and relief programs, but the UNRRA's plan only covers 21% of this amount, and the UNRRA will end its work before June 30 this year, so it will not be able to fully implement this limited plan in China. Some Americans have said that the current chaos in China is caused by itself, which is a big mistake, and it is not a unique phenomenon in China. Even "countries with well-organized economies" in Europe have the same situation now. It should be known that China has been at war for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses, which is unmatched by any other United Nations member. Therefore, it is not surprising that the economy is in a serious state today. What China urgently needs now is foreign aid and cooperation, especially from the United States. Only in this way can the commercial relations between China and the United States be developed, and the future can be rapidly improved.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] Ambassador Gu Weijun said in a speech at the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Conference today that although the phenomenon of the sharp depreciation of the legal currency a week ago was heavily burdened, it should not be considered that the Chinese economy will inevitably go bankrupt, but if there is no appropriate assistance and cooperation from foreign countries, especially the United States, the situation cannot be controlled for a long time.</p>
<h3>Gu Agrees with Private Operation for Non-Defense Industries</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 18th] Ambassador Gu informally expressed his approval of his country's government's decision to sell off industries other than important defense industries and return them to private operation. It is said that the National Resources Commission, established during the war, operates 300 factories producing various products. It has now been decided to sell all industries except heavy industries related to national defense to private individuals or sell their shares, which is commendable. At the same time, the establishment of a new exchange rate between the US dollar and the legal currency will be a factor in stabilizing the value of Chinese currency. China really needs cotton and other supplies to help its post-war industry resume production. Once the new measures are fully effective and China's purchasing power is stable, the purchase of imported goods will begin. China will be a major market for various consumer goods, various food products, and various heavy machinery and tools in the future, but this will depend on its foreign exchange surplus. On the Chinese side, it is preparing to immediately start exporting large quantities of tungsten, antimony, fur, bristles, tea, and raw silk products, hoping to make the United States its major market, where most of the goods had previously been mainly marketed in the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Marshall Attaches Great Importance to China's Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun told reporters after meeting with Secretary of State Marshall yesterday that Secretary Marshall was very sympathetic to and attached great importance to China's difficult situation. As for the content of their meeting and whether a decision had been reached, Ambassador Gu was unwilling to announce it, only saying that the meeting was of an "explanatory" nature. The 500 million US dollar loan proposed by the Export-Import Bank for China was also discussed, but no decision was made. The issue of American mediation of China's political problems was not discussed. Ambassador Gu continued that Chairman Chiang has now decided to transfer state-owned factories to private operation. This move will enrich the government's financial institutions better than selling them off. These factories were taken over by the government's wartime measures, and most of them were unwilling to produce for profit, causing the government to suffer losses. After returning them to private operation, the government will no longer suffer this loss.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall told visitors that he had a detailed discussion of the situation in China with Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun yesterday, and Ambassador Gu had requested assistance from the United States, especially cotton and wheat.</p>

<h3>Jewelry Industry's Gold Ornament Transactions Will Be Limited in Quantity; Nanjing Silver Industry Proposes Four Points to Authorities</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After the announcement of the measures to strengthen financial business control, operators in the jewelry industry are generally worried about whether they can continue to sell gold ornaments in the future. If their business scope is limited to silverware, their business will be unsustainable. In this regard, a reporter visited an official responsible for drafting the "Measures for Handling the Finished Gold Ornament Industry," who said that the jewelry store's operation of gold ingots and gold bars is beyond its business scope, and according to the new measures, it should be completely prohibited. As for the sale of gold ornaments, it may not be completely prohibited, but the weight of each item and the monthly and daily turnover may be restricted so that it does not become a disguised gold trading. The initial draft of the handling measures has been drafted and is now being submitted to the higher authorities for review, and it is expected to be announced by the weekend or early next week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Jewelry stores in Nanjing continued to be closed on the 19th. In the morning, the jewelry stores sent representatives to discuss the future business matters and decided to petition the authorities, suggesting four points: (1) Please allow the exchange of gold ornaments, handled according to the central bank's listing price; (2) Gold ornaments received after exchange, in addition to being used for melting and still making ornaments, should be sold to the central bank if there is more, and apply to the central bank for allocation if there is less; (3) Jewelry stores shall not operate gold bars and gold ingots; (4) The profit of the silver industry shall be determined by the industry association based on the actual situation with the cost of living index as the standard, and submitted to the competent authority for approval by the association.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions: Government to Reorganize Mid-Next Month; Zhang Zhizhong Expresses Willingness to Strive for Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 19th. Minister Zhang answered reporters' questions as follows: Regarding the reorganization of the government, how is it proceeding? Answer: The reorganization of the four institutions will begin soon.</p>
<p>Question: Can the reorganization be completed before March 15th? Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Question: Prior to his resignation, President Sun mentioned to foreign reporters that peace talks would depend on the conclusion of the Lunan battles or a new decision. Now that the Lunan battles have temporarily concluded, can peace talks be resumed? Answer: I have no knowledge of this.</p>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 18th] Zhang Zhizhong received reporters at the Provincial Government Guesthouse here at 4:30 PM on the 18th. He stated that if the Chinese Communists are willing to open the door to peace talks, he (Zhang referred to himself) would be willing to do his utmost to strive for it. The key to the peace talks currently lies in whether the Chinese Communists are sincere, as the government has never abandoned its peace policy. He has been back in his hometown for two weeks and has not communicated with Nanjing. If it is necessary to stay in Nanjing after arriving, he will postpone his return to his new post in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Chen Jiakang, Director of the Chinese Communist Shanghai Office, stated yesterday that he had not heard of the rumors that peace talks would be resumed. He also denied the news that Bu Lizhi had met with Dong Biwu during his recent visit to Shanghai. He stated that the Chinese Communists would not abandon the two conditions previously put forward.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party Refute Luo Longji's Speech; It is an Undeniable Fact that the Democratic League Sides with the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Luo Longji is currently giving speeches at Jinan University and other places, and his speeches have touched upon the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. Authorities from both parties believe that Luo's speech distorted the facts and issued separate statements yesterday to refute it.</p>
<p>Democratic Socialist Party Statement</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party: Luo claims that our party should be held responsible for destroying the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). However, what power does our party have to destroy the PCC? On the other hand, our party also has no power to protect the PCC. He also believes that our party should not abandon the pursuit of peace and instead pursue a democratic constitution. This view is wrong, because democracy is a gradual process, and progress in democracy is definitely not impossible even during a civil war. Luo said that among all the constitutions, none were drafted during a period of national division. With Luo's "erudition," he is not aware that the German Weimar Constitution was drafted under conditions of domestic disunity. Luo also opposes our party's participation in the National Assembly "without a PCC foundation." It should be noted that the convening of the National Assembly was stipulated by the PCC. If it is not based on the PCC, then where is the legal basis of the PCC? He falsely claims that our party is conducting secret negotiations with the government. In fact, our party has no secrets to speak of, and all activities have been reported in newspapers. He believes that participating in a government organization is closing the door to peace. He should know that after gradual realization of democracy, the distance between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be narrowed, and the realization of peace is even more possible.</p>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng's Statement</p>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party issued a statement yesterday, saying: Luo's intention is that only the Kuomintang and the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties should be held responsible for the current situation, while the Chinese Communist Democratic League seems to have no responsibility. Given Luo's position, he can only say so. But I believe that the PCC and war cannot coexist. Where there is war, there is no so-called PCC. Those who fundamentally destroy the PCC are those who wage war. Whoever fights is the one who wants to destroy the PCC. In recent months, the Kuomintang has initiated ceasefires at least twice. Once was a ten-day ceasefire regarding Zhangjiakou, and the other was a ceasefire voluntarily declared by the government before the opening of the National Assembly. Unfortunately, both ceasefires were rejected by the Chinese Communists. Who should be held responsible for the current situation caused by the inability to cease fire? This point should be seriously considered by Luo. The Youth Party has no armed forces, and neither do the Democratic Socialist Party nor the Democratic League. The responsibility for the current situation is very slight. We have no intention of shifting responsibility to the Democratic League, but two things are worth recalling. One is that before the opening of the National Assembly, people from the Third Force held long discussions at the Bank of Communications in Nanjing and formed a concrete plan, which was simultaneously proposed to the government and the Chinese Communists. When the government had not yet expressed its attitude towards this plan, Luo, as a member of the Democratic League, was severely criticized by the Chinese Communists and had to withdraw the plan automatically. The other is that the Third Force proposed a concrete plan to the government to postpone the opening of the National Assembly and continue consultations. At that time, people from the Third Force had all signed the plan, but before it was submitted, some members of the Democratic League, after contacting the Chinese Communist delegation, requested to withdraw their signatures. However, Luo did not withdraw his signature, which is admirable! These two facts show that some members of the Democratic League side with the Chinese Communists, which is an undeniable fact. To revive the spirit of the PCC, a ceasefire is a prerequisite. I wonder what Luo thinks of the Chinese Communists' repeated rejection of peace talks?</p>

According to law, they should be announced publicly, so it will take some time.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhenggang and Qiu Changwei Visited Zhuozhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The Political Guidance Group of the Pacification Zone, led by Gu Zhenggang and Qiu Changwei, went to Zhuozhou on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway this morning to conduct inspections.

<h3>Military Training for High School Graduates to be Extended to the Next Academic Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Due to insufficient preparations, military training for graduates of high schools and above has been approved by the highest authorities to be postponed until 1948.

<h3>We Stop Negotiations with the Philippines; Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Issue Statement; Overseas Chinese Unanimously Praise Firm Stance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department announced today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to issue a statement within one or two days regarding the suspension of treaty negotiations between China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] The overseas Chinese here unanimously expressed their praise for the firm stance taken by the government of their home country in ceasing to prolong the fruitless negotiations with the Philippines on a treaty of friendship. Although the local overseas Chinese hope that a Sino-Philippine treaty of friendship can be concluded following the Sino-Philippine commercial treaty, so that both countries can benefit, they are not at all surprised by the repeated changes of the Philippine government officials, which led to the interruption of the negotiations. This can be seen from the fact that the Philippine side insisted on changing the entire draft at the last minute. One overseas Chinese commentator said: "At a time when overseas Chinese are suffering from Philippine intimidation and terrorist acts, and the Philippine government and Congress are constantly considering dozens of unjust measures aimed at completely excluding Chinese, it would be ridiculous to talk about friendship with the Philippines." At the same time, foreign observers here believe that the national prestige that the Philippines has gained since its independence will be diminished due to its recent capricious attitude in the Sino-Philippine negotiations.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] General Jilun, the US member of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, returned to Beiping at 3:00 PM this afternoon and had contact with Ye Jianying that evening. Ye was originally scheduled to return to Yan'an on the 17th, but has repeatedly postponed his return. It is generally speculated that he is waiting to meet with Jilun before returning to Yan'an, and some speculate that Jilun's visit to Nanjing has an important mission. People close to Jilun told reporters today that Jilun's visit to Nanjing was in response to a telegram from President Chiang.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Personnel from the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation continue to withdraw. One plane flew to Yan'an today, carrying four Communist personnel and supplies. All personnel from the Changchun Executive Sub-Headquarters for Military Mediation arrived in Beiping by train today. Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff on the government side, has scheduled a farewell party for the US personnel on March 1, as the US side will withdraw completely by the end of March.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Naval officials indicated today that the US Navy may soon withdraw from China, following the US personnel of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation in Beiping and the Marines. Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to discuss the changing situation in China. Kirk's fleet originally consisted only of light aircraft carriers, destroyers, and cruisers stationed in Qingdao. Since the recall of Special Envoy Marshall, naval officials have expected that this fleet would also be withdrawn from China. The ships may be transferred to Guam or Saipan. It is not yet known whether the US naval personnel currently assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy in Qingdao will withdraw when the US fleet is ordered to leave China.</p>

<h3>Name of German Philanthropist During the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Troops Has Been Ascertained; Current Whereabouts of John Rabe Still Unknown</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The German newspaper "New York State Pioneer Times" reported today that the name of the German philanthropist who saved the lives of countless Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese troops in 1937, after a long investigation by the Chinese side, has now been determined. The newspaper's deputy editor, Aobussen Dorf, received two letters from Loson and Yanado, proving that the person was John Rabe, the former manager of a German trading company's branch in Nanjing. Loson is a former German staff member of the US Embassy in Beiping, and currently works at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. Yanashi is a former German officer and advisor to the Chinese army, and currently lives in New York. After hearing the United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 6th that Mayor Shen Yi and others were making every effort to find the person and intended to provide him with financial assistance, and that American members of the International Relief Association also wanted to bring this German back to China and give him a pension to reward his merits, they sent letters to report. It is said that Rabe founded a refugee camp, saving the lives of thousands of Chinese, and presided over the Nanjing branch of the International Relief Association. He later returned to Germany in 1938, and was arrested and placed in a concentration camp by the secret police for giving speeches and exhibiting photos exposing the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanjing. As for his current whereabouts, they also have no knowledge.</p>
<h3>President Song Refutes Rumors; We Have Not Requested the Sale of UNRRA Materials; UNRRA Central Committee Holds Special Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to the United Press, the Chinese government has requested that UNRRA's US$200 million worth of materials be sold at black market prices. A Central News Agency reporter spoke to President Song and asked for his opinion. President Song declared that this unfounded report was due to certain parties deliberately misinterpreting the measures of UNRRA and CNRRA in order to provoke relations between China and the United States. Leaving aside other things, the claim in the news that Jackson, the Deputy Director-General of UNRRA who recently visited China, would consider approving the black market method, is enough to refute this rumor.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Chinese officials here recently denied reports this morning that the Chinese government had requested the United States to allow it to sell UNRRA materials worth US$200 million on the domestic black market in order to obtain cash and overcome the crisis of national currency depreciation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The UNRRA Central Committee of nine countries will hold a special meeting at 3:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time, which is 4:00 AM on the 20th) to discuss the reported Chinese request to sell UNRRA goods worth US$200 million. In addition to the United States, the other members of the UNRRA Central Committee are China, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Yugoslavia.</p>

<h3>Chairman Receives Yang Jialuo and Others</h3>
<p>Inquires about the Work of the World Encyclopedia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Chairman Chiang recently received Professor Yang Jialuo, Director of the Chinese Encyclopedia of the World Academy, Li Shuhua, Deputy Director of the Beiping Research Institute, Zheng Chen, editor of the Chinese Encyclopedia, and others. The Chairman inquired about Yang's work on the World Encyclopedia. Yang first described the process, and then requested that the government implement the suggestion in the Siku Quanshu Encyclopedia (the first volume of the World Encyclopedia) as soon as possible, namely, to establish an institution to compile the Chinese Encyclopedia, as this suggestion had been passed by the Second Plenary Session and submitted to the National Government for handling. He then stated that when the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization met in Paris recently, it passed a resolution on the mutual translation of classical books from various countries. In fact, Professor Zheng Ting of the Chinese Encyclopedia has already translated the pre-Qin classics and philosophers, but due to printing difficulties, only two volumes have been published recently, and the rest have not been printed. He asked the government to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Wanbaoshan Case Public Trial</h3>

The court originally prosecuted them for the crime of armed robbery, but because it is related to Sino-Japanese disputes, it may constitute the crime of foreign aggression. The trial had not yet concluded at the time of sending the telegram.</p>
<h3>Zhegan Railway Accelerates Track Laying; Can Reach Yiwu by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Zhegan Railway Bureau is actively promoting the project, laying tracks at a rate of 2.5 kilometers per day. Zhengjiawu Station has already sold tickets. It will be possible to reach Dachen within days, Yiwu by the end of the month, and Jinhua in April. However, the lack of locomotives after reaching Yiwu has become a major problem. It is learned that UNRRA has allocated nine locomotives to the railway, all of which are in Hong Kong and have not yet been transported to Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Tightened Funding and Rising Prices; Zhejiang Seawall Project is棘手</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 19th] Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau, told our reporter that the most difficult problem in the seawall project recently is that CNRRA has informed them that the flour ration for workers will be reduced from 12 kilograms per worker to 2.5 kilograms per worker. Once this is announced, the workers on the seawall may disperse in a commotion. The second major difficulty is that the salaries of the bureau's personnel were originally paid according to CNRRA standards, but recently they were informed that this was not approved, and project experts Tang Zhenxu and Shao Fu have therefore submitted their resignations one after another. In addition, only 2 billion yuan of the initial project cost of 6 billion yuan has been received recently. The prices of cement, lead wire, and hardware that were planned to be purchased have all exceeded the budget by several times, so the seawall project is deeply affected.</p>

<h3>Original Sentence in the Muk渎 Grain Hoarding Case Revoked; Provincial Government Orders Severe Punishment; Cooperating with the Government's Emergency Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Muk渎 large grain hoarding case was previously lightly punished by the county government. When the provincial government learned of this, it considered it inappropriate. On the 19th, it urgently telegraphed Wu County Magistrate Shen Chenglong, ordering him to continue sealing up the hoarded grain, transfer the grain merchants to another place for interrogation and trial, and apply the "Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Food Management During Emergency Periods" and the "Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations" to impose a severe punishment in order to cooperate with the government's new price policy.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Investigates Inventory; Discovers Concealment and Underreporting</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] In order to suppress prices, the military and political authorities of this county, after the decision of the tenth party-government-military meeting of the command post, organized a price investigation team to investigate the grain storage and prices of various daily necessities in the warehouses, and set up five secret reporting boxes in the urban area to reward people for reporting hoarding and profiteering merchants. The team has already dispatched an investigation and has now found that the inventory of various daily necessities in the shops does not match the reported quantity, especially the inventory of yarn shops is quite sufficient. Dingfeng alone underreported 146 bales, and Xintongtai raised the price of yarn. All of this has been reported to the command post by the investigators for record. As for the county government, it convened an emergency meeting on the 18th with the heads of the trade associations for firewood, rice, oil, yarn, cloth, five ocean goods, department stores, flour, Chinese and Western goods, and North-South goods to discuss suppression measures.</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Functionally Returns to Zhen Guo Su; Orders Strict Suppression of Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Province, returned to the province from Shanghai at 1:06 AM on the 18th, and temporarily telegraphed Xu Baoguang, the special commissioner of the second district, Shen Chenglong, the county magistrate, and Zhao Weijun, the police chief, to go to the station to receive instructions. Wang spoke sternly about the price issue, saying that no means should be spared to suppress prices to below 70% of Shanghai's prices, otherwise, severe punishment would be imposed.</p>
<h3>Pacific Island Trusteeship</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of trusteeship of Pacific islands, the U.S. government, through its delegation to the United Nations, once again submitted a trusteeship plan yesterday, requesting the Security Council to consider it. This plan includes 1,500 islands in the Pacific, which were under Japanese rule and are now occupied by the U.S. military. The most well-known of these are the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline Islands. According to this plan, these islands will remain under the sole control of the United States, and the U.S. will be allowed to establish defenses in certain areas designated as "restricted zones," free from the control of UN agencies. Furthermore, while the UN Charter stipulates that administering countries should submit reports on the areas under their trusteeship at any time, the trusteeship plan proposed by the U.S. this time includes certain reservations, namely, that the U.S. government may choose which areas the reports should be submitted on. This means that the U.S. government has the freedom to decide which areas under its administration should be reported on and which areas need not be. In addition, the U.S. proposal suggests that the trusteeship islands should establish financial, customs, and administrative ties with the areas governed by the U.S., integrating these islands with the U.S. administratively and economically. Although, according to the UN agency's broadcast, the Security Council's agenda is currently very crowded, so it is still uncertain when this plan will be submitted to the Security Council for discussion, there is no doubt that this plan will be submitted for discussion, no matter how busy the Security Council's work is.</p>
<p>In terms of sentiment and emotion, we naturally express full support for the U.S.'s proposed Pacific island trusteeship plan in general. On these islands, many American youths sacrificed themselves on their desolate beaches and in their dense jungles. These islands were mostly under Japanese mandate before the Pacific War. Since the American army has occupied these islands with bloodshed and sacrifice, for their own future security and the peace of the entire world, the fact that they have gained control of these islands as a result of the war should be unanimously recognized by the international community. Before the United States entered World War II, it had already assisted the Allied nations with the material resources of the Lend-Lease Act. Although the benefits China received from this were extremely small, after entering the war, it sent troops to assist in the war. The military control of these Pacific islands, acquired as a result of the United States' own military actions, should win general recognition and support from the international community. From a moral point of view, we have no objection to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States.</p>
<p>However, emotion is one thing, and legal principle is another. The trusteeship agreement plan proposed by the U.S. government this time was originally announced on December 6 of last year, and has been submitted to the Security Council member states and the governments of the Philippines and New Zealand for their records. Subsequently, the governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia requested that the United States wait until the signing of the peace treaty with Japan before submitting it. However, the U.S. delegation to the UN agencies ignored the opinions of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia and submitted it ahead of schedule. Regarding this point, we feel that it does not matter much. The issue of trusteeship of the Pacific Islands must eventually be raised, and it is a good strategy to raise it before the peace treaty with Japan is signed. Some people believe that the U.S. government's proposal of this draft trusteeship agreement goes against the U.S.'s promise in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Declaration not to seek territorial expansion, and is also contradictory to President Truman's statement in Potsdam that he "does not seek an inch of territorial expansion." What we want to point out here is that trusteeship is one thing, and territorial expansion is another. At least in legal principle, trusteeship is not the same as territorial expansion. The United States occupied these islands with military force, and now it is submitting a draft trusteeship agreement to the UN agencies, which is precisely taking into account the collective security system of the UN agencies. For the United States, this can only be said to be a bitter pill. It was American blood that was shed on these barren islands in the Pacific, and yet it still has to submit its trusteeship plan to this international organization. For the sake of international justice, there should only be sympathy for this plan proposed by the United States, and no malicious criticism. However, some of the reservations proposed by the United States, such as the U.S. government's right to choose the areas where reports should be submitted, and the regulations regarding certain "restricted zones," seem to be quite different from the original purpose of creating UN agencies and establishing the trusteeship system. How to reconcile the provisions of this draft agreement with the spirit of the UN agencies is something to be hoped for from further consideration by the U.S. government and the Security Council.</p>
<p>As for saying that the U.S.'s purpose in obtaining the trusteeship of these Pacific islands is to counter China and the Soviet Union: this is an overstatement. There has always been a traditional friendship between China and the United States; it is too unimaginable that there will be a war between China and the United States. We must not be misled by this kind of rumor; in reality, this seems to be an anti-American act with an international background. The Pacific after World War II is completely different. Japan, which dominated the Western Pacific, has now declined; and there have also been extremely important changes in the situation in the North Pacific. The Kuril Islands, which served as a barrier to the North Pacific, have now been incorporated into the Soviet territory, and the Soviet Union's power has suddenly extended into the North Pacific. The transfer of the Kuril Islands is only found in the so-called Yalta Agreement. This was originally an agreement between the three great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Since other countries that fought against Japan did not participate, and the disposition of the former Japanese islands was not approved by the UN agencies, it has no legal binding force in theory. But this is already a fait accompli. At this time, with the U.S. proposal of a Pacific island trusteeship agreement, we cannot help but admire that even in the handling of this issue, the U.S. government still respects the spirit of international rule of law to some extent.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the Pacific Islands, what we must raise is the issue of the Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands. These islands originally belonged to Chinese territory. In Cairo, the lack of a clear decision on these islands does not mean that we have given up our claims to these islands. We reserve our claims to these islands; if they are transferred to trusteeship without our consent, the Chinese people will rise up in unanimous opposition, which is what we must point out.</p>

<h3>Marshall's Reply Published: U.S. Rejects Soviet Protest, Says Acheson's Remarks Were Within the Scope of His Duty</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall has formally informed Molotov that Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's candid remarks to a Senate committee, stating that Soviet foreign policy has a "progressive and expansionist" nature, should not be deemed unacceptable in the democratic system of the U.S. government, and this is a matter of responsibility. Marshall's reply is in response to the Soviet note of February 14, which was delivered to the Soviet side by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and published here today. According to the Soviet note, Acheson's remarks were "rude insults and extremely hostile to the Soviet Union," and urged the U.S. to pay attention to "Acheson's unacceptable behavior, as he disregarded his position and arbitrarily made these remarks." Acheson's remarks were made in response to a question from Senator McKellar on February 10, when the Senate committee was hearing the opinion of Mr. Lilienthal in order to decide on the recommendation of appointing Mr. Lilienthal as Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The Soviet note also stated that McKellar's question was a "rude attack" on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Note</p>
<p>The full text of Marshall's note is as follows: "The note of February 14th, conveyed by Ambassador Smith, has been received, in which you refer to the statement made by the Undersecretary of State to a committee of the United States Senate as an intolerable act and regard this statement as an impudent slander containing the intention of being hostile to the Soviet Union, etc. The remarks to which you object were not volunteered by the Undersecretary of State, but were merely in reply to questions by a member of the Senate. This reply was made in questions that were fully permitted by the Chairman of that Committee. The exchange was as follows: Senator McKellar asked: 'Now, assuming that the Soviet Union not only wishes to acquire the countries that it now has, but wishes to extend its territory further, do you believe that if the Soviet Union discovers the secret of the atomic bomb that country would not only seize the rest of Europe, but even encompass the rest of the world?' Acheson replied: 'I do not believe that this question can be answered in the manner you have asked. I am deeply aware that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is indeed one of aggression and expansion. I believe that one of the major efforts being made by all people in the United Nations is to attempt to find a way to resolve these types of problems. If such methods and agreements can be found, then it is hoped that there will be no large-scale conflict in the future, otherwise, I believe the situation will be very serious.'"</p>
<p>"You are fully aware of our country's constitutional system, including the respective limits of authority between the legislative and executive branches of our government. According to our system, officials of the executive branch, in committees of the legislative branch, have a duty to frankly answer all questions that do not involve secrets or violate public interests, and there has never been an exception to this situation. Therefore, the Undersecretary of State's frank and conscientious answer to the question cannot be called intolerable, but is in fact in line with his duty. You refer to the content of his statement as an impudent slander and hostile to the Soviet Union. According to our standards, expressing reasoned criticism of a public policy cannot be considered slander. Therefore, I know that if you reconsider, you will not mistake frankness for hostility."</p>

<h3>Indian Constitutional Work Encountering New Crisis: Britain Will Recall Wavell: It is Rumored that Britain May Withdraw from India Within a Specified Period</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco 19th Broadcast: The New York Times correspondent in London said that within one or two days, British Prime Minister Attlee will issue an important statement announcing that Britain will take the same steps towards India as it did towards Palestine, and completely hand over India to the management of Indians within one year.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] Authoritative sources claimed today that the British government, due to the new crisis in Indian constitutionalism, has decided to recall Indian Viceroy Wavell. Prime Minister Attlee will announce this in the House of Commons tomorrow, and will also publish a white paper. Tomorrow's announcement is "extremely important" to India. When an official answered a question, he said: "It is not impossible for Britain to withdraw from India within a specified period." The official declined to explain this statement in detail. The recent crisis in India was caused by the Muslim League's repeated refusal to participate in the Constituent Assembly. British officials said that the crisis is about to break up the Viceroy's interim government. Congress leader Nehru recently wrote to Wavell, strongly arguing that there are still five Muslim League members in the Indian cabinet, which is inconsistent with the Muslim League's policy of refusing to participate in the Constituent Assembly. The five Muslim League cabinet members then stated that they had no intention of resigning. Wavell asked the British government for instructions, and the British cabinet then held continuous meetings last week and this week to discuss the Indian impasse. Official sources also said that Nehru wrote to Wavell twice last week, requesting the London government to reply as soon as possible and warning Wavell that unless the Muslim League cabinet members resign immediately, all nine Congress cabinet members will resign.</p>

<h3>U.S. Oil Industry Workers: Suddenly Decide to Strike</h3>

<h3>Restoring the Gold Standard: Combating Communism</h3>
<p>American Business Tycoon Advocates</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 18th] Mr. Abbotting, President of the American Foreign Trade Association, delivered a speech at the World Trade Conference here today, advocating that the United States should use circulating gold coins as a way to combat communism. It is said that the time has come for the United States to seriously consider minting and circulating gold coins. The restoration of the gold standard will create confusion among international communist believers and immediately discredit them. Every commercial nation, except the Soviet Union, hopes to raise the value of its currency in the international market to stimulate foreign trade. Restoring the gold standard can eliminate the idea of ​​barter worldwide. The barter system is favored by the Soviet Union, while the United States is only concerned with a value-based system.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Plan: Awaiting Final Decision from the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The US policy on Japanese reparations is about to be decided, in order to facilitate Japan's economic recovery. The shipment of reparations materials will begin soon after the US policy is finalized. This plan will be the basis for Japan's general reparations plan, as the countries involved in the Pacific War have not yet reached an overall agreement on this issue, which must be resolved before Japanese industry can engage in a planned postwar economy. The main reason why the Allies have failed to reach an agreement is the Soviet Union's objection to deducting its "spoils of war" from Northeast China from its share of Japanese reparations. The US policy on Japanese reparations will be based on the report of reparations representative Pauley to President Truman and the reports drafted by the seven-member expert group. Pauley's report, based on political and other factors, advocates severely reducing Japan's economic power. The seven-member group's report is based purely on technical considerations, and the two reports are at opposite extremes. Although the US policy on Japanese reparations is about to be decided, the shipment of reparations materials will not begin immediately; formal shipment will have to wait several months. However, the planning work for dismantling, transportation, and loading is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Eisler Indicted</h3>

<h3>The Beginning and End of the Palestine Conference</h3>
<p>Britain will submit the Palestine issue to United Nations bodies, but will not request an emergency meeting before the UN General Assembly convenes in September of this year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today the British decision to submit the Palestine issue to United Nations bodies. He said that the breakdown of negotiations was due to the uncompromising attitudes of both the Jewish and Arab sides, and that a solution was currently impossible.</p>
<p>Bevin Announces the British Position</p>
<p>Other key points announced by the Foreign Secretary include: (1) The British government is well aware that it is no longer possible to establish a solution in accordance with the 1939 White Paper; (2) As a mandated power, Britain is in a difficult situation and does not want to impose an arbitral decision on either side, so it has decided to submit the entire issue to United Nations bodies; (3) Britain will detail to United Nations bodies the infeasibility of the mandate at present and present the various proposals that have been put forward by the British, Jewish, and Arab sides; (4) The British government is well aware of the difficulty for United Nations bodies to review the Palestine issue before the General Assembly convenes in September; (5) He specifically stated that the British government's recent proposal had a firm promise to gradually and rapidly complete the independence of Palestine, but it was still rejected by both the Jewish and Arab sides.</p>
<p>Finding a Solution is No Longer Possible</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Bevin also detailed the previous handling of the Palestine issue, saying: Since taking office, I have been trying to solve the Palestine issue. Those who support the government feel that it is no longer possible to find a solution based on the 1939 White Paper. Because of the great concern of American Jews about the Zionist idea, an Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Team was appointed in November 1945, and it was also decided to allow 1,500 Jews to immigrate each month. In addition, 12,000 Jews were allowed to immigrate to Palestine after the White Paper ceased to apply. In total, 29,000 Jews have been allowed to immigrate since July 1945.</p>
<p>Negotiating Basis Emphasizes Partition</p>
<p>After the Anglo-American Committee's report was published, it was reviewed by British and American officials, and it was jointly suggested that negotiations with the Jewish and Arab sides be based on Morrison's provincial autonomy plan. However, the Jewish and Arab sides in Palestine did not accept it, and the representatives of the Arab countries finally held a meeting with the British side in London on July 31, 1946. The Palestinian Arabs participated in the meeting in January of this year, while the Jewish Agency consistently refused to participate. Only at the end of the meeting did it hold informal talks with the British government outside the meeting. Both the Jewish and Arab sides rejected Morrison's provincial autonomy plan, but the Arabs put forward a counter-proposal, advocating the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, permanently maintaining the Arab residents as the majority. The British government, knowing that the Morrison plan was no longer possible as a basis for negotiation, put forward a new proposal to establish two autonomous regions, Jewish and Arab, and another central government jointly participated in by the two ethnic groups. It also stipulated that 4,000 Jews would be allowed to immigrate each year for the next two years. In addition, there was a feature not found in previous plans, namely, a promise to gradually and rapidly complete the independence of Palestine five years after the trusteeship. However, both the Jewish and Arab sides refused to accept this plan. Here, I would like to state the reasons for the repeated rejections by the two ethnic groups. The independence of Palestine is inevitable. According to democratic principles, the majority of residents should have the right to decide the fate of their country.</p>
<p>Jewish and Arab Claims Are Vastly Different</p>
<p>The Arabs believe that the continued expansion of the Jewish people is sufficient to hinder the independence of Palestine Arabs, so they oppose the continued immigration of Jews and the establishment of a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. The ultimate goal of the Jewish Agency is to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, so it initially suggested that Britain continue to administer the mandate so that it could continue to expand the Jewish territory and allow Jews to immigrate, until it eventually demanded the independence of the Jewish state in Palestine. Later, the Jewish Agency proposed a compromise plan to partition Palestine, but demanded that Jewish immigration matters be controlled by the Jewish Agency. Therefore, the British government is faced with two irreconcilable principles. Palestine has 1.2 million Arab residents and 600,000 Jewish residents. The latter demand the establishment of a Jewish sovereign state, while the former firmly oppose it.</p>
<p>The Only Way is to Seek Arbitration</p>
<p>Judging from the negotiations in the past few months, it is well known that there is no possibility of establishing a solution through negotiation. According to the mandate provisions, Britain cannot dedicate Palestine to Jewish or Arab rule, or unilaterally decide on partition. Therefore, the only way is to ask United Nations bodies to decide. During the transitional period before the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September, we will still continue to fulfill our mandated responsibilities.</p>

<h3>The Supervision Team is Swift and Decisive: The Gongyi Rice Shop's Stockpiling of Rice is Uncovered; Shop Owner Jin Zhongliang is at Large; the Accountant is Detained and Sent to the Garrison Headquarters; It is Reported That He Has Bribed a Certain Government Agency</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Section of the Economic Supervision Team yesterday uncovered a rice shop that stockpiled a large amount of rice and bribed government officials. Xiao Fuquan, a member of the section, received a tip-off that the Gongyi Rice Shop at 982 Avenue Petain was hoarding a large batch of rice, attempting to sell it at a high price. After receiving the report, Xiao immediately sent personnel to investigate. The shop had already received wind of this at this time, and secretly moved the rice stockpiled at No. 1, Lane 624, Tianping Road to No. 982 Avenue Petain overnight. Xiao then sent personnel to search the address and found 235 bags of stockpiled rice. The shop owner, Jin Zhongliang, had fled beforehand after hearing the news, and his accountant, Yang Jingfang, was arrested. According to Yang, the shop had been discovered by a certain government agency for stockpiling rice some time ago, and at that time, it bribed them with 6 million legal tender and 12 dan of rice to settle the matter, and presented a certificate to this effect. After obtaining the confession, Xiao immediately sent him to the Garrison Headquarters, where he will be severely punished according to military law for the crime of disrupting the people's food supply by stockpiling rice during a time of emergency and for bribery.</p>
<p>[Another report] Yesterday, the Economic Supervision Team continued to send personnel to monitor the gauze market, and the market situation was stable. However, due to the scarcity of goods arriving at the North and South rice markets, prices tended to rise in the morning. Commander Xuan was very angry after receiving the report. He said that the rice price in the city fluctuated with the gold rush last week, and the rice merchants took the opportunity to raise prices illegally. Later, General Zheng Jiemin explained the stakes to the rice industry representative Wan Molin, and Wan immediately promised to lower the selling price day by day and restore the original price before February 1. The supervision team is executing this policy and there is absolutely no room for flexibility. He ordered Wang Zhongqing, the head of the Grain Section, to be responsible for thoroughly investigating, and anyone who commits a crime will be arrested immediately. After receiving the news, the rice merchants and vendors did not dare to shout high prices and automatically suppressed the prices, which were not much different from yesterday. Those who had already completed transactions at higher prices also suppressed them and settled the accounts at the market price of the previous day. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau's public rice did not sell for the past few days because the rice market was abundant in supply and there was no need to distribute it. If the market supply falls short of demand today, a considerable quantity will be released again, so the rice price should not tend to rise.</p>
<p>Investigating Large Households That Profited from Gold Purchases</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The three-person subcommittee composed of the Gold and Banknote Section of the Economic Supervision Team, the Ministry of Finance, and the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) continued to actively investigate the gold rush yesterday. The work on the Central Bank has come to an end. The supervision team is tracking down the quantity of gold bars sold by the Central Bank to five large silver shops, including Tongfengyu and Fang Jiuxia, then investigating the quantity resold by these five to smaller banking houses, and then investigating the accounts of the smaller banking houses to get to the bottom of who ultimately purchased the gold, and then compiling and analyzing this information. It is believed that the large households that made profits from gold purchases will be identified within days. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the staff under the command of the three-person subcommittee gathered on the second floor of the Central Bank to discuss and were given instructions on the work policy by Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan of the Ministry of Finance. Immediately afterward, they were divided into eight units to investigate the accounts of private banks and money houses, paying special attention to illegal speculation using gold as collateral to purchase and resell. However, as of yesterday, no suspects have been arrested. The rumor that several managers of gold shops have been detained is not true.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Request Resumption of Gold Jewelry Sales: Four Provisional Business Regulations Are Proposed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Silver Shops Trade Association believes that the recent government ban on gold sales and the cessation of business by silver shops not only affects the livelihoods of employees but also makes it impossible for farmers to purchase ornaments, which is not a way to encourage them. Therefore, it has specially drafted four provisional business regulations to request that the Municipal Council uphold justice: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry manufactured and sold by silver shops shall not exceed two liang (關秤) on the official scale, and small gold bars shall not be melted and sold. (2) Silver shops shall be allowed to collect and exchange gold jewelry, and the price shall comply with that stipulated by the Central Bank. (3) In addition to being used for the manufacture and sale of jewelry, any remaining collected and exchanged gold jewelry should be sold to the Central Bank. If there is a shortage, an application should be made to the Central Bank for allocation. (4) The business profit shall be determined by the Silver Shops Trade Association with reference to the business situation and the cost of living index and with the consent of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>[Another report] The representatives of the silver and jewelry industry petitioned the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce the night before, arguing that gold jewelry is actually a kind of savings for ordinary people to prepare for emergencies, and not purely for decoration, so there seems to be no reason to prohibit it. Chairman Pan and Director Xu believe that what the industry has stated is true, and they have jointly telegraphed the Central Government through the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the regulations on the collection, exchange, sale, and processing of gold jewelry not be prohibited, but that each piece be limited to two liang (關秤) to show restriction.</p>
<h3>February Salaries: Calculated and Converted to Legal Tender Before Implementation of Rationing System</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the payment of workers' wages in February, Director Zhao of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday that it should be in accordance with the government's instructions, and the maximum should not exceed the index of January. Before the implementation of the fair price supply of daily necessities, the calculation of the three items of rice, cotton cloth, and fuel in the index is different, and the difference between the market prices in February and January should be converted into legal tender and paid.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphes the Government: Requests Continued Production Loans</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the United Banking Syndicate (四聯總處) intends to stop production loans. After hearing this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially submitted a petition to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting continued operation to complete the mission of increasing production. It stated: Since the national policy has been set, it should be implemented consistently and should not be changed lightly due to temporary special phenomena. Please uphold the President's intention to assist production enterprises with loans, and approve the continued operation of the low-interest factory production loans handled by the United Banking Syndicate, and actively expand and relax collateral, simplify procedures, eliminate abuses, and strengthen supervision, so that the factories can strive to improve themselves and complete the mission of increasing production for the country.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Every Citizen Should Know How to Strive</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. All walks of life in Shanghai held a grand commemorative meeting at the Grand Theater yesterday morning at 9 a.m., attended by Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and more than 1,000 people from all walks of life. The venue was arranged solemnly and simply in accordance with the purpose of the New Life Movement. Five pots of fresh flowers were placed in front of the stage, and the party and national flags and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait were hung in the back, as well as the New Life emblem and the green characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame (禮義廉恥)" (see picture). Various slogans such as "Understand Propriety and Righteousness," "Know Integrity and Shame," "Take Responsibility," and "Abide by Discipline" were decorated around, which were solemn and brilliant under the reflection of the arc lights.</p>
<p>The meeting began at 9 a.m., and after performing the rituals, Chairman Wu, the Mayor, reported, saying: The New Life Movement has played a significant role in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and Shanghai especially needs to promote the New Life Movement today. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to revive old morality and promote the inherent spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, which is the right medicine for the current national malaise. Based on what I have seen in Shanghai in the eight months since I arrived, I deeply feel that the current turbulent situation lies in the people's decadent emotions. The formation of this phenomenon is caused by two words, one is "selfishness (私)," such as speculation and manipulation, hoarding and profiteering, stirring up the gold rush, and inciting civil war. The second is "hypocrisy (偽)," often pretending to be benevolent and righteous, and words and actions are inconsistent. How can we make the country rich and the people strong in this way? Therefore, I deeply feel that the two kinds of character of the Chinese people, "selfishness" and "hypocrisy," urgently need to be eliminated. We should transform "selfishness" into "public interest" and "hypocrisy" into "truth," so that the country and nation can have new hope.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan delivered a speech, explaining that the Council's suggestion that the Public Utilities Bureau brightly illuminate the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame (禮義廉恥)" on the International Hotel is to alert the people and implement the New Life Movement. However, it is meaningless to only make these four characters brightly illuminate. The promotion of the New Life Movement must be practiced by every citizen, and only by being diligent and thrifty and striving to improve ourselves can we achieve the goal of national prosperity and people's well-being.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters said in his speech: The essence of the New Life Movement lies in understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by the rule of law. Today is the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. Let us try to discuss the situation in Shanghai. Are there people who can truly practice the requirements of the New Life Movement? On the contrary, there are many who say one thing and do another. The life of the Chinese people is becoming increasingly corrupt. The way to remedy this is the New Life Movement, but the chaos of the situation is the biggest obstacle.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan said: The New Life Movement has been promoted in China for 13 years. Currently, most citizens in Shanghai have developed bad habits in their old lives. We must thoroughly practice the requirements of the New Life Movement to change the social atmosphere. The promotion of the New Life Movement is not only in slogans, but must eliminate all stubborn opposition. I am willing to follow the citizens of the city and implement it first. Councillors Zhang Zhongyuan, Fei Shusheng, Shao Yongsheng, and others then delivered speeches one after another. After the meeting, the movie "Iron Bone and Ice Heart" was shown immediately.</p>

<p>[British News Agency, London, February 18] The International Language Club, founded before the war by Mr. Tricell, held a grand banquet last night in Croydon to celebrate its ninth anniversary. In addition to the Mayor of Croydon, bishops, presidents of chambers of commerce, and representatives from various government agencies, there were also many Chinese members and 600 students from all over the world who dined together. The club has now become the largest dormitory for overseas students in the United Kingdom. The basic rule within the department is that all members must befriend each other in order to get to know each other, which has been very satisfactory. During the banquet, the founder, Mr. Tricell, raised his glass to the mayor and reported that the club has now been officially recognized by the Department of Town and Country Planning, which has designated an area for the club's development. Therefore, it will soon need a large sum of money to build dormitories. He has received a portion of the donation from the Rockefeller Foundation, but he hopes that the necessary funds can be raised in the United Kingdom. After dinner, there was dancing and dance performances, and before the meeting ended, the members sang Scottish songs together.</p>

<h3>After the Victory Against Japan, the Ministry of Education Receives Important Cultural Relics; Section Chief Xu Bopu Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent] According to Section Chief Xu Bopu of the Department of Social Education under the Ministry of Education, which is in charge of cultural relics, after Japan's surrender, the receipt of cultural relics should be handled by the Ministry of Education in accordance with the regulations on the handling of enemy and puppet property. The Executive Yuan has also repeatedly ordered all its subordinate agencies to comply with this regulation. Recently, the National Government issued another circular stating that cultural relics must not be included in the auction of enemy and puppet property, and that cultural relics must be immediately transferred to the Ministry of Education. Those who violate this order will be severely punished. From all these measures, it is clear that the government attaches great importance to the protection of cultural relics. The Ministry of Education, recognizing that the preservation of cultural relics is crucial to the cultural lifeline of our country, has made detailed plans. In addition to establishing a temporary committee for clearing war-time cultural relics losses to formulate an overall plan for the preservation of cultural relics, it has also strictly ordered special commissioners in various regions of the ministry to pay close attention to the matter. It has also made every effort to negotiate the handover of cultural relics received by other agencies. Despite repeated setbacks, it has always sought to receive them as soon as possible for relevant agencies to organize and study them, in order to preserve them. However, since the beginning of the process, the public has been very concerned about how much has been received and what has been received. Therefore, the following is a brief account of the most important items: (1) The Mao Gong Ding: This ding is the crown jewel of bronze vessels in the world. After Japan's surrender, the original owner, Mr. Chen Yongren, considering that private collections had no guarantee during times of turmoil, presented it to the government through the introduction of Mr. Ye Yuhu and others, and specified that it be handed over to the Central Museum for management. However, after a year of twists and turns (early August of this year), it was finally handed down by the Chairman and has now been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be stored at the preparatory office of the Central Museum.</p>
<p>Haiyuan Pavilion Collection</p>
<p>(2) Haiyuan Pavilion Collection: This collection was owned by the Yang family of Liaocheng, Shandong. Around 1921, it was transported to Tianjin and stored in the warehouse of the Yanyeh (Salt Industry) Bank. Previously, local gentry in Tianjin and Beijing, including Pan Fu, Chang Langzhai, Wang Shaoxian, and Zhang Ting'e, organized the Cunhai Society to protect it. However, the Japanese had long regarded it as their own. In February of this year, President Song Ziwen visited Tianjin and, through the gentle persuasion of Mr. Zhang Ting'e, acquired it for the state at a cost of 20 million yuan. The collection consists of 92 titles, 1,207 volumes, all of which are fine editions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. It has been temporarily entrusted to the National Beiping Library for safekeeping, and a special room of the Cunhai Society has been set up to commemorate the event. (3) Ze Cun Library: This is the collection of the traitor Chen Qun, said to contain a million volumes, stored in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. The part in Suzhou is currently being negotiated for receipt by the Ministry of Education. The part in Shanghai has already been cataloged. The part in Beijing has been taken over by the National Central Library for organization and opening to the public, and consists mainly of fine editions of the Ming and Qing dynasties, approximately 300,000 volumes.</p>
<p>Manchu Puppet Palace Books and Paintings</p>
<p>(4) Books and Paintings from the Manchu Puppet Palace and Awarded to Pu Jie: After the victory, the National Army took over Changchun and then withdrew. Upon withdrawal, Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping, at the request of Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, selected the most precious books, a total of 13 boxes, from the puppet palace and airlifted them to Shenyang, where they were stored in the warehouse of the Central Bank. In mid-August, these were handed over to Mr. Jin Yu, representative of the Committee for Clearing War-Time Cultural Relics Losses of the Ministry of Education stationed in the Northeast, under the supervision of Mr. Jiang Fucong, Director of the Central Library, and Mr. Li Ji, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum. They are temporarily stored at the Shenyang Library of the Northeast Regional Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education. Song editions account for nearly half of these books, such as the Song edition of the Xin Tang Shu (New Book of Tang), Tong Jian (Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government), and Tong Jian Ji Shi Ben Mo (Complete Account of Events from the Comprehensive Mirror), which are all complete sets. Furthermore, there are as many as seven types of Song edition of the Six Dynasties Literary Anthology. After checking against the list of books awarded to Pu Jie, it was found that they accounted for approximately one-third of the entire list. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Dong, the 13 boxes that were transported out were all fine editions of the Song and Yuan dynasties. There were dozens of other wooden boxes of books that were not transported out, which were slightly inferior to those transported out, but unfortunately, they were all destroyed when the Communist army entered Changchun. Regarding the books and paintings from the Manchu Puppet Palace awarded to Pu Jie, the Ministry of Education received a telegram from the Chairman ordering a secret investigation and recovery for national ownership. Today, only this part of the collection has been obtained, and it is said to be not easy to recover even this much after the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Cultural Relics in Pu Yi's Residence</p>
<p>(5) The situation of receiving the cultural relics stored in Pu Yi's residence: Pu Yi's old residence is located on Dihua Road in Tianjin and was occupied by the US military. After several rounds of negotiations, Mr. Shen Jiantu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Tianjin-Beiping area, Mr. Kerrcliff, representative of the US military, Mr. Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum, and Mr. Wang Shi, representative of the Committee for Clearing War-Time Cultural Relics Losses of the Ministry of Education, jointly received 222 boxes of cultural relics in Tianjin together with representatives from the Tianjin-Beiping Area Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. The items are still being sorted. In addition, 1,085 pieces of jade and several paintings were found in a safe:</p>
<p>(1) Song Gaozong (Emperor Gaozong of Song) and Ma Hezhi's painting "Postscript to the Red Cliff Prose" (Hou Chibi Fu Tu);</p>
<p>(2) Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy of the Tao Te Ching (Daodejing);</p>
<p>(3) Zhao Mengfu's "Autumn Outing and Drinking Horses" (Qiujiao Yinma Tu);</p>
<p>(4) Qian Xuan's "Lonely Hill" (Gushan Gang);</p>
<p>(5) Deng Wenyuan's cursive script authentic handscroll.</p>
<p>These five items are all missing items from the Palace Museum, and the "Autumn Outing and Drinking Horses" is listed in the "Catalogue of Books and Paintings Awarded by Pu Yi to Pu Jie" printed by the Palace Museum. All of the above items have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be temporarily preserved by the Beiping Palace Museum. According to investigation, there were originally 50 large wooden boxes in Pu Yi's residence, said to contain: 1. Seven large boxes of the original handwritten manuscript of the Records of the Guangxu Emperor of the Great Qing Dynasty; 2. Bronzes, porcelain from the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong periods, silverware, and paintings; 3. Imperial fur robes. After the victory, all were moved to Pu Xiu's home on Tianjin Road. The residence was sealed off by the Tianjin Garrison Command, and there seems to have been some loss of items stored inside. Some people have witnessed Kangxi porcelain bowls and other items circulating on the market. It is hoped that they can be received as soon as possible to avoid further losses.</p>
<p>Wen Su Ge's Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature)</p>
<p>(6) Wen Su Ge's Siku Quanshu: The books in this pavilion were originally stored in Shenyang. After the September 18th Incident, the enemy and puppets did not move them. They have now been received by the Northeast Regional Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education and have been handed over to the Shenyang Library of the committee for temporary safekeeping. (7) Libraries of the Shanghai and Beiping Modern Science Museums and the Shanghai Tongwen College: The books from the Shanghai Modern Science Museum and the Tongwen College have been handed over by the Ministry of Education to the Central Library for transportation to Beijing for temporary safekeeping and will be opened for exhibition first. As for the Beiping Modern Science Library, it has been transferred by the Ministry of Education to the National Central Research Institute for receipt and temporary safekeeping. (8) Antiques stored at the Chinese College Friendship Association of the German Defu Foreign Firm in Beiping: They have been handed over by the Ministry of Education to the Palace Museum for receipt and temporary safekeeping. (9) Book Plates Collected by the Traitor Wang Jingwei: These book plates are the family letters of the Zeng, Zuo, and Hu families and were stored in the Tianjin Zhongshan Park Library. The Tianjin-Beiping Area Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has sent a letter to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Education for unified handling. They are now preserved by the Beiping Library, awaiting further instructions from the Ministry of Education, with a total of 2,275 book plates. (10) Books and Paintings Left by Shen Changgeng: One set of the Four Categories of Books (Sibu) has been handed over to the National Institute for Compilation and Translation for utilization. Fourteen ancient paintings have been handed over to the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum for receipt. (11) Ancient bronzes and porcelain from the Ze Cun Library: including one bronze and 41 pieces of porcelain, have been received by the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum.</p>
<p>Japanese Painter Yazaki's Famous Paintings</p>
<p>(12) Paintings by the Japanese Yazaki: Yazaki was a famous modern Japanese painter. He respectfully presented 1,008 paintings (pastels) of famous scenic spots in various countries to our government. They have now been received by the Palace Museum for temporary safekeeping. (13) Bronzes Collected by the German Yang Ningshi: The bronzes collected by Yang are mostly unearthed from Yin Ruins and have been systematically organized. This spring, they were presented to our government and have been handed over to the Palace Museum for temporary safekeeping. A special room has been set up for their display, with a total of 121 bronze objects and 120 weapons. (14) The Victory Golden Pen Used for Signing the Surrender: This pen was presented by Mr. Hu Yunzhuang, an overseas Chinese industrialist in the United States, to Admiral Nimitz, and he instructed him to use it when signing the surrender to Japan. Nimitz did indeed use this pen to sign the surrender and, after the surrender, attached a full-body photograph of the signing ceremony and a personal letter, which he then presented back to Hu as a souvenir. Hu considered this pen to be of great historical value. After decorating it, he asked Mr. Lu Zuofu to bring it to the Ministry of Education when he returned to China and specified that it be preserved by the Central Museum. It has now been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be handed over to the museum for receipt. As for the books received, they are still being sorted and cataloged.</p>

<h3>Open Badminton Inaugural Match, Exciting and Tense Men's Doubles, Tao Ni Team Wins After Three Sets of Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The inaugural Badminton Open Championship held its opening match at 6 p.m. last night at the City Gymnasium. The audience was more enthusiastic than during the league matches. The badminton game is a full-body exercise. Although the rules are different from tennis, the practice methods are similar. Its interest and excitement are not less than those of tennis games. There were three matches in the opening match last night: (1) Men's preliminary singles, Dao Nier defeated Yu Zhongyao, 15-2, 15-0. (2) Men's doubles, Tao Guanqiu and Ni Zhengyi defeated Wu Guotao and He Chuanlong, a hard-fought three sets, 18-17, 17-18, 15-14, tense and exciting, unprecedented. Mixed doubles, Cao Hongran and Ye Jingxiong team defeated Cai Kewen and Miss Ping Zhimeng, 15-10, 15-9. The battle situation of each match is as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Preliminary Singles</p>
<p>In the men's preliminary singles, Yu Zhongyao played against Dao Nier, which started at 6 o'clock and was the opening show of this session. Dao attacked more than defended, and the forehand smash showed strength. Therefore, the situation became one-sided. He quickly made it 12-1. In the first game, he won 15-2. In the second game, Yu changed his strategy and continued to smash, but because the opponent used position shots and feint methods, he won the second game 15-0 again.</p>
<p>Dao Nier 15-2 15-0 Yu Zhongyao</p>
<p>Men's Doubles</p>
<p>At 6:40, the men's doubles followed. The connection between Wu Guotao and He Chuanlong seemed better than the opponent, leading by 4-0. Later, due to the smashing of Tao and Ni, the situation became tense. The score was close, becoming 6-5, 9-8, 12-11. After a fierce battle, it quickly became a 13-tie. Wu and He were the first to get 13 points, so according to the rules, they had the right to use a wide-open deciding score of 5 points.</p>
<p>During the rematch, it was first one each. Wu and He's offensive was strong, making it 4-2. Due to excessive tension, they repeatedly self-killed, and Tao and Ni chased up, winning the first game 5-4, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>In the second game, the initial battle was tied at 4-4. Tao and Ni's movements were calm, making it impossible for the opponent to take advantage. They once made it 13-5, which was also a huge gap. By coincidence, another 13-tie came in the audience's shouts, which was not unique.</p>
<p>The matter was important, and the fight became fiercer. In each of the two rounds, the two sides fought a life-and-death battle. Those who lost their attacks took two minutes. After killing each other for 4 points, Wu and He made a hot shot, making the enemy 5-4, causing the air in the ball court to change instantly. The situation was evenly divided, and there was a third game dispute.</p>
<p>In the third game, Tao and Ni went down the current with 7-1. Mr. He and Wu were a pair of spectacle-wearing gentlemen, and the difference in eyesight may be a factor in the failure. Tao and Ni finally benefited from 15-4, laying the foundation for the overall situation.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>The mixed doubles was the final match last night. Cao Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong took the lead with 6-1 as soon as they entered the game. Cai Kewen and "Foreign Miss" Ping Zhimeng lost because of poor pairing, and Ping often missed the ball. Cao and Ye won the first game 15-10, and won the second game 15-9 in a row. Ping's actions were funny, and his strange laughter added to the audience's interest.</p>
<h3>Basketball League, Two Acts Tonight, A One Renyu Faces Quanhei, A Two Pei'er Battles Jia Shen</h3>
<p>The basketball league will have three matches in the A group as usual tonight from 5:30 pm. However, the last match between Shantou and the Giants in A group one was requested to be rescheduled due to some reason. With the consent of both parties, the Basketball Committee approved the postponement. Therefore, there are only two matches today, namely A two Pei'er versus Jia Jia. A one Renyu meets Quanhei, tickets remain the same.</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 pm, Pei'er of A two meets Jia Jia. The former once fought hard last week to defeat the heroes of Green Forest, and its momentum is strong. The people under its command, such as Yu Erjia and Wang Weigong, are young and strong, and their strength is still strong. The latter's lineup also has many good players, such as Tao Yingshi, Lv Miaosheng, and Sun Moxi, all of whom are basketball veterans. There will be a fierce battle at that time.</p>
<p>Starting at 6:30 pm, Renyu of A one meets Quanhei. After Renyu defeated the once-dominant Chunmao team with 40 to 34 a few days ago, its arrogance was high and invincible. Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyuan, Shen Pengju, Sun Guozheng, etc. have pure and hot connections and fast passing, and are the fastest growing and most accomplished basketball players in recent years. Quanhei was originally not Wu Xia Ameng, such as Jia Youliang, Lu Dazhen, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Jusheng, Li Zude, He Xiaoguang, Yan Youling, Qu Qiaonan, etc., all of whom are basketball veterans, but they are scattered everywhere and rarely practice. He also defeated the Railway Beijing team last weekend, and his remaining power can still be seen. If he meets Renyu today, Renyu will be the winner. But Quanhei will also do his best to deal with it. The order of today is recorded later:</p>
<p>Pei'er — Jiajia (A Two) 5:30 pm</p>
<p>Referee Ni Xiaoben Jin Jiabiao</p>
<p>Renyu — Quanhei (A One) 6:30 pm</p>
<p>Referee Hu Zongfan Hu Hongxin</p>
<p>(Pei'er) Yu Erjia, Yu Ersui, Zai Junbing, Wang Weigong, Ge Xinghai, Zhou Huikai, Shen Beizhang, Zhang Xianping, Hu Huizhao.</p>
<p>(Jia Shen) Sun Moxi, Tao Yingshi, Zhu Zhonglin, Yan Shilu, Lv Miaosheng, Yu Liangzi, Hou Yongkang.</p>
<p>(Renyu) Chen Wei Yuan (Captain), Shen Pengju, Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyuan, Liang Yongjia, Sun Guozheng, Wu Xinyun.</p>
<p>(Quanhei) Jia Youliang, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Jusheng, Lu Dazhen, Zhou Zhi, Qu Qiaonan, Li Zude, Yan Youling, He Xiaoguang, Tao Shaosheng, Zhang Xianlun.</p>

<h3>Director Fang Wanbang of the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee Discusses the Sports Situation in Taiwan and Fujian: Taiwanese People Have a Generally Strong Interest in Sports</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 19th] Fang Wanbang, a member of the National Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education, flew from Shanghai to Taiwan on November 22nd of last year to inspect sports education. On December 5th, he flew from Taiwan to Fuzhou, Fujian, for inspection. In late January, he took a ship from Fuzhou, passing through Shanghai, and returned to Beijing in early this month to report to the Ministry of Education. Our reporter recently interviewed him, and he discussed the sports situation he observed:</p>
<p>Fang Wanbang inspected more than 60 schools and social education institutions in Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Changhua, Pingtung, Chiayi, and Hsinchu. He observed three main advantages:</p>
<p>Impressions from Inspecting Taiwan Province</p>
<p>(1) Taiwan has an excellent climate and environment. (2) Taiwan has excellent sports facilities (swimming pools, sports fields, gyms, large sports arenas, etc., are well-equipped). (3) The general population has a widespread interest in sports. What it lacks, as observed during the inspection, is a complete sports administrative organization and social sports groups, as well as sports leadership talent, teachers, and appropriate sports teaching materials. After contacting the province's education administrative authorities, he made the following recommendations: Regarding administrative organizations, he suggested that the province establish a "National Sports Committee" and province-wide sports organizations. This has now been adopted, and the committee and organizations have been formed. He also suggested training current substitute teachers to quickly cultivate national sports talent in order to improve and enhance the quality of teachers. This has been agreed upon and is being actively implemented. He also suggested increasing and strengthening sports teacher training institutions, and the normal college has been ordered to add a sports department. Regarding funding, he suggested that the sports budget be independent, and that special funds be allocated to subsidize the construction of sports facilities, to establish a sports equipment manufacturing plant, and to find ways to purchase and distribute sanitary supplies from the Central Health Administration. These items are also being prepared separately for implementation. Regarding teaching materials, he suggested organizing a "Sports Teaching Material Compilation and Review Committee" to delete inappropriate teaching materials, supplement and introduce new teaching materials, and stipulate standards for sports equipment in schools at all levels, all of which have been adopted and planned. Regarding social education, he suggested establishing sports fields at all levels in stages, and it has been decided to first prepare for establishment in Taichung, Taipei, and Tainan, and personnel have been assigned to strengthen management.</p>
<p>Opinions from Inspecting Fuzhou</p>
<p>In Fuzhou, Fang inspected 24 middle schools, 7 colleges and above, 2 national schools, and 2 schools established by other organizations, and also temporarily investigated two cases under the orders of the ministry. He felt that most principals and physical education teachers were aware of the importance of sports and worked hard, but due to limited funding and space, most schools were unable to achieve ideal standards in sports facilities. He made the following suggestions: (1) It is recommended that the education supervisory office add a sports supervisor with rich experience in sports administration and teaching to plan, supervise, and promote sports throughout the province. (2) Strengthen the equipment, curriculum, and faculty of normal schools and professional sports training institutions to cultivate primary school sports teachers. (3) Strengthen or adjust professional training institutions and sports fields to improve sports efficiency. (4) Strengthen the management of provincial sports fields to fully provide for school and community sports activities. (5) Stipulate minimum standards for fields and equipment for schools at all levels and complete them within a time limit. (6) Schools that have reached the standards, if sports funding is insufficient, may increase sports fees, but must budget separately and submit it to the competent authorities for approval. (7) Normal schools should not collect sports fees, and ways should be found to remedy this or allocate a special subject budget.</p>

<h3>Mobile Funds Display Dominance, Lack of Chips Reported, All Chinese Stocks at Limit Up, Special Settlements Said to Be Done Through Cross-Trading to Avoid Risk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose again amidst loose monetary policy and tight chip supply, with many reaching the limit up. The premium for Meiya was as high as 250 yuan, Yongsheng 100 yuan, Xinyi 25 yuan, and Jingfu Qinxing 10 yuan. It is said that cross-trading firms, seeing the great risk, will start doing special settlements to avoid danger.</p>
<p>The market opened high and then suddenly fell back due to overnight floating orders for selling, with Yongsheng falling from 2020 yuan to 1920 yuan. After Zhongfa reached the limit up, it fell back by more than ten yuan, and market sentiment was high. Numbers 105 and 217 both entered the market, causing prices to rise, and the price returned to 2020 yuan. Numbers 177, 218, and 47 then sold at 1970 yuan. Numbers 76 and 180 tried to maintain the price, and numbers 102, 145, 106, 196, and 85 purchased, with Yonggong by number 157, Jiufu by number 171, and Yongye by number 49 all reaching the limit up first. Yongsheng then rose back to 2065 yuan. Numbers 95, 177, and 218 sold, and the price fell back to 1980 yuan. Numbers 14, 145, 12, 180, 1, 154, 198, 35, and 224 purchased, and it was rumored that a loan of 500 million yuan had been secured. Number 145 re-entered the market after selling, and numbers 180, 52, and 149 vigorously purchased, causing the price to rise to 2120 yuan. Numbers 76 and 155 sold, but only struggled slightly. Shangwu reached the limit up by number 117, and Jinglun by number 219. Numbers 145 and 224 purchased vigorously, but the supply on the trading floor remained tight, and the price was close to the limit up by noon. Hanjingfu and Rongmeng also reached the limit up. At the noon closing, number 156 and others offered to sell, and the market turned sideways. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, and Jingfu each rose by more than 10%. Meiya and Qinxing reached the limit up. Only half a day of delivery trading was conducted. It is estimated that Yongsheng, Xinyi, and Huafeng rose by more than 10%. Jingfu and Meiya rose by about 15%. Cold stocks Jiufu, Yongye, Cement, Liann, Jinglun, Underwear, Shuigong, Shangwu, and Rongfeng reached the limit up. Xinya had previously reached the limit up. Zhongsi was stable. The rest all rose by about 10%. Zhongfa was traded at the limit up plus ten yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Trading Sees a Full House in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Only spot trading and Tuesday's delivery trading were conducted in the afternoon. When the market opened, number 198 purchased, and the premium for spot Yongsheng was more than 30 yuan after reaching the limit up. Numbers 180, 83, 76, 47, 156, 78, 89, 207, and 91 all sold, and Yongsheng gradually fell back to 2110 yuan. At this time, the market outside was almost a full house. Numbers 97, 106, 156, 172, 224, and 145 re-entered the market, and spot Yongsheng reached the limit up again. After entering, all stocks reached the limit up. The premium for Xinyi was even higher at 25 yuan, Meiya reached 250 yuan, and Jingfu Qindian 10 yuan. Zhongfa still had buyers at 90 yuan. Market sentiment was greatly boosted, and the supply of chips was extremely tight. Numbers 145, 224, 149, 155, 76, and 50 purchased, and the final premium reached 100 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, all spot trades reached the limit. Only half a day of trading was conducted on Friday's delivery trades, so the increase was less significant. Yongsheng, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose by more than 10%. Jingfu and Meiya rose by about 15%. The delivery trades on the past two days, Huafeng and Meiya reached the limit up. The rest did not open. All stocks outside the market rose again.</p>

<h3>Authorities Concerned About People's Food, Rice Prices Based on Yesterday's Market, Only Allowed to Fall, Not Allowed to Rise, Arriving Rice Still Plentiful, Market Suddenly Sees a Rebound, Flour and Miscellaneous Grain Prices Rise Universally</h3>
<p>According to Wang Zhongqing of the Grain Group of the Shanghai Economic Supervisory Corps, from today, all rice prices in this city must be based on the prices reported on the 19th. They are only allowed to fall and not allowed to rise. Anyone who stirs up trouble or attempts to raise prices privately will be reported at any time and severely punished in accordance with the law. The heads of the North and South Marketplaces were also instructed to report the daily arrival, trading, and sales conditions on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The amount of rice arriving yesterday was 4920.20 shi in the South Market and 6918 shi in the North Market, totaling more than 11,800 shi in the two markets. Shipments from various gangs continued to arrive steadily, and the market suddenly saw a rebound. The previous days of decline had been significant, and the production price and the Shanghai market price were gradually closing in. Generally, vendors did not intend to sell lightly due to cost considerations, leading to stability in market sentiment. Rice shops had also been waiting for low prices for several days and took this opportunity to replenish their stocks. As a result, sales were indeed more active than the previous day, and transactions increased, turning the market from weak to strong. The prices of both japonica and indica rice rebounded by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, the dark rice was still not selling well, and the price was stable. It is reported that the market in the North Market was more bullish than in the South Market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Slightly improved, but trading stalled because the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau were stationed in the market, resulting in very little activity from flour merchants and few brokers. However, the underlying trend was supported by rice prices, and sellers gradually hardened their prices. However, actual sales remained sluggish, so no official transactions were reported throughout the city. Lirang foreign flour was priced at 72,100 yuan, and Bingshen flour was priced at 51,200 yuan, rebounding by more than 2,000 yuan from the previous day. The speculative atmosphere for wheat bran was heated up again, and the market price rose sharply by more than 2,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce and prices were firm, but no trading was conducted.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The market was also rising. In the general trend of various commodities turning upwards, the atmosphere of exhaustion in the market no longer existed. In addition, there has been no news of the resumption of oil allocation, so the street took advantage of the low prices to hoard oil, and the prices of those holding goods also gradually increased, and the market gradually became firmer. Finally, the price of Lousheng oil was 230,000 yuan, and the price of Jilong Sheng oil was 270,000 yuan. Sheng oil rebounded by about 30,000 yuan, and soybean oil followed closely by 10,000 yuan. Xiaoche vine oil also showed a 10,000 yuan rise, and Taichang Qing oil was traded at 210,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Universally rebounded. After the price of soybeans stabilized, both the factories and the merchants felt active, and the market rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply of broad beans was scarce, and the price rose steadily by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Tea beans rebounded by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and red beans also showed a firm trend. Sesame seeds were scarce, and the market also rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The supply and demand of raw peanuts was relatively balanced, and the market was stable. Soybean cake remained lackluster, and the price was sluggish. Red sorghum was similar.</p>
<h3>Strange Tightening of Money Supply in South and Central China, Internal Exchange Rate Further Adjusted, Guangzhou Increased from 15 Yuan to 40 Yuan per Thousand</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the government's emergency economic measures, the money supply in various places has become extremely tight, especially in South and Central China. In Guangdong, the black market exchange rate has increased to 120 yuan per thousand in recent days. Wuhan has risen sharply to 20 yuan per thousand. Qingdao in Shandong has also been affected, reaching 50 yuan per thousand. In view of this, the Central Bank specially readjusted the internal exchange rate on the 18th (the new exchange rate was only announced on the 17th and has been seen in the Times). In the Guangdong region of South China, Guangzhou increased from 15 yuan to 40 yuan per thousand, Shantou increased from 50 yuan to 60 yuan per thousand, and other places also increased from 50 yuan to 60 yuan. In the Hubei region, Wuhan and Wuchang were changed from 5 yuan to 12 yuan, Shashi and Yichang were changed from 6 yuan to 15 yuan, and other places were changed from 12 yuan to 15 yuan. In the Shandong region, Qingdao increased from 10 yuan to 30 yuan, and other places increased to 20 yuan. Wenzhou in the Zhejiang region also increased from 25 yuan to 30 yuan. Only the Jiangxi region was reduced by 2 to 3 yuan. The commercial firms in the highly black market exchange rate in South China can only maintain expenses and cannot make a profit. It is learned that the fluctuation in Guangdong was affected by the strict ban on gold and banknotes, and the fact that Macau and Hong Kong cannot directly exchange currencies is also a major reason.</p>
<h3>Zhongzhi Still Allocates Cooking Oil to Retailers at the Original Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhongzhi factory allocated cooking oil to retailers in Group B from No. 201 to No. 400, with each barrel weighing 360 catties. The price was still based on the original price decided above, which was 170,000 yuan per dan, plus a delivery fee of 6,500 yuan. The total price per barrel was 618,500 yuan. Payments were made by check on the 19th, and delivery will be on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Fresh Intestine Purchase Price Temporarily Set at 2,000 Yuan per Set</h3>
<p>After the exchange rate revision, the price of fresh intestines rose from 1,700 to 1,800 yuan to 2,000 yuan per set due to the sellers' reluctance to sell, and various factories competed to purchase them as out-of-town goods arrived in Shanghai. The guild believes that the overseas selling price is currently still declining, and foreign merchants have attempted to lower the price to 40 cents per set in US dollars, but the official market price is generally more than 50 to 60 cents. Therefore, the guild temporarily sets the highest price for fresh intestines at 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Once the official overseas market price and transaction situation are determined within this week, the guild will prepare to convene an emergency meeting to discuss and determine the purchase price. The market price of processed intestines is also expected to be determined at that time.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Rebound Again, Class C Bids Exceed 10,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds rebounded, and the market rose again. In the afternoon, off-exchange trading saw Class C bids as high as over 10,000. Class C opened at 7,300 yuan, and there was competition to buy. Room 540 purchased, and rooms 503 and 604 sold first and then purchased, with the high price reaching over 9,000 yuan. Room 552 sold and retreated to under 8,000 yuan. The market was stable at closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, B, D, and E each rose by around 1,800 yuan, D rose by 1,600 yuan, and C rose by over 3,000 yuan, with a trading volume of approximately 14 million.</p>
<h3>Amount of US Dollars Redeemed Exceeds 2 Million in Three Days</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank continued to redeem gold and US dollars yesterday, but the number of people going to redeem US dollars was increasing day by day. In the past two days, more than a thousand people went each day. The amount of exchange has also expanded compared to before. The foreign exchange counter in the Business Bureau on the second floor of the Central Bank was insufficient. Therefore, starting yesterday, the Central Bank added three new counters to specialize in redemption. It is reported that since the 17th, the total amount received in three days has exceeded 2 million.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of Export Promotion Council to Meet Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council, in order to actively promote the promotion of export trade in line with the new emergency economic measures announced by the government, has scheduled a meeting at 10:00 AM today in the President's Office of the Central Bank. It is reported that the opinions extracted by President Song during the meeting with the executive committee and consultants of the council will also be submitted for discussion separately.</p>
<h3>Banking Institutions' Cash Position Gradually Loosens</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, told reporters: The cash position in the market was very tight last Saturday and has now loosened. A large number of funds were remitted out of the city in previous days to purchase export goods at the place of origin due to the announcement of the export subsidy measures, and the city's cash position temporarily decreased. At the same time, after the announcement of the government's new economic measures, the transactions between banks and shops have been greatly reduced, resulting in a very loose cash position for banks and shops with a solid foundation and stable business, and a very tight cash position for banks and shops with a thin foundation. Now, more than two days later, the situation has gradually eased, so the cash position in the market has loosened. The work of inspecting banks and shops is still in the initial stage, and the results have yet to be announced.</p>
<p>It is also learned that after several days of tight cash positions in the market, it has gradually loosened starting yesterday. The Four Banks and Two Bureaus cleared out a cash position of more than 7 billion yuan at the clearing house yesterday. The cash position between banks and shops has also loosened. After several days of waiting and watching, the mobile funds in the market gathered in the securities market yesterday, resulting in many stocks reaching the limit up. However, the Textile Construction Company sold a large batch of cotton yarn yesterday, and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will sell sugar in the same way today, so it may absorb another batch of funds from the market.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Approved for Price Increase, 3,500 per Gallon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Gasoline Price has been approved by the Input Management Committee to rise to 3,500 per gallon starting yesterday. The distribution system will continue to be implemented. The number of car-owning class members registering and applying for purchase is very enthusiastic these days.</p>
<h3>Diesel Prices Also Adjusted</h3>
<p>Texaco Asia and Mobile, and other gasoline companies in the city, have increased the import price of gasoline due to the adjustment of the exchange rate. With the approval of the Provisional Input Management Committee, the retail price of gasoline has been revised to 3,500 yuan per gallon from today. The price of diesel has also been set as follows: bulk light diesel 480,000 yuan per ton, medium diesel 467,500 yuan per ton, heavy diesel 455,000 yuan per ton. If the bulk is inclusive of barreling fees, light diesel is 515,000 yuan per ton, medium diesel is 500,250 yuan per ton, and heavy diesel is 490,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The tea market has been unusually quiet recently. Since the authorities adjusted the exchange rate against the US dollar to 12,000 yuan, sellers have been asking for prices that are astronomical and without any standard. Among them, especially the various export teas, almost all have an attitude of being reluctant to part with them. Therefore, although the buying interest has been strong and unabated in recent days, the negotiations have been difficult and ultimately the transactions have fallen into a standstill.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Food Transported to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haijin ship sailed to Tianjin yesterday, carrying over 5,400 bags of sugar, over 180 bales of cotton yarn, and 60 bolts of cloth. In addition, Landing Craft Utility No. 101, besides carrying gasoline, also transported 600 tons of salt to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Rationing Quantity Difficult to Reach Newspaper Reports</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that since the central government decided on the rationing method for daily necessities, the Fuel Management Committee has provided the Ministry of Economic Affairs with opinions on the rationing of coal briquettes. The quantity that may be rationed in the future may be difficult to reach the quantity reported in the newspapers; otherwise, it will affect other uses in society. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the amount of coal arriving at the port recently is slightly less than in the past. The reason is that the port of Qinhuangdao is frozen and transportation is hindered, and the work efficiency of miners in Taiwan has also decreased due to living conditions. The competent authority hopes to procure coal from Jiaozuo, Henan, and transport it via the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing, or first transport it from Pinghan to Hankou, and then transport it to Shanghai by waterway. However, the vehicles required for both routes are still under negotiation. As for the Hongji coal from Annam, which once supplied the city, it is now prohibited from being exported by the French, citing the reason of a coal shortage in Vietnam, and there is no hope of resumption in the short term.</p>
<h3>Industrial Oils Weak and Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Spring Festival, industrial oils have risen sharply, with average prices increasing several times. Coconut oil has risen from 200,000 yuan to 850,000 yuan per dan, tallow from 180,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan, and asphalt from 250,000 yuan to 550,000 yuan. Soap factories have the strongest demand, so the market is quite strong, and prices have repeatedly surged. However, as credit has tightened recently, soap factories and oil factories have been reluctant to absorb the goods, and those holding goods are eager to sell them for cash, so prices have fallen one after another. The current market price for Tree Brand coconut oil is 550,000 yuan per sima dan, with transactions occurring between 500,000 and 520,000 yuan. Tallow is 400,000 yuan per sima dan. Asphalt from Jiaxing is reduced from 550,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per shi dan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Fruit Exports Expected to be De-Controlled Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Taipei, 18th] All imports and exports in Taiwan Province are currently under control, and fruit merchants have suffered the greatest losses. It is hoped that control will be lifted next month.</p>
<h3>Although Retail Sales are Quiet, Trade Among Dealers is Quite Active: Yarn Market Rebounds Yesterday; China Textile Construction Acts as Agent for 2,136 Bales</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market rebounded yesterday because the recent declines have been large, attracting dealers to absorb goods. 10-count yarn is considered good at 2-300,000, and 42-count at 300,000. However, retail sales are still quiet, with few purchases being made. Most of the transactions on the market are between dealers, and the market is not very stable. In the afternoon, China Textile Construction Co. acted as an agent for the Textile Control Committee to open sales, with a total of twelve types of yarn. Prices were similar to the previous period, and purchases were quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Co. yesterday sold cotton yarn for the second time on behalf of the Textile Control Committee, selling a total of 2,136 bales, of which factories accounted for 1,232 bales and trading houses accounted for 904 bales. A total of 615 applicants, of which factories accounted for 429 and trading houses accounted for 186. This time, the company designated 16-count Golden Dollar, which was allocated to the towel, dyeing and weaving, underwear, and knitting industries. 20-count Blue Phoenix was allocated to the dyeing and weaving, canvas, and towel industries. 21-count Football was allocated to weaving factories. 40-count Real Light was allocated to the dyeing and weaving, knitting, handkerchief, and underwear industries, and the remainder was allocated as usual.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Committee to Discuss Yarn Purchase Price Plan Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Textile Control Committee is scheduled to hold its 25th regular meeting at the Municipal Government at 4:00 pm today, at which it will discuss the plan provided by the Six District Cotton Textile Association to adjust the purchase price of cotton yarn. It is learned that the hope of the factories to calculate the purchase price at 90% of the listed price of China Textile Construction Co. seems unreasonable, and the cost price will still be calculated based on the actual production cost.</p>
<h3>All Grades of Fine Cloth Increase Sharply and Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw strong demand for all grades of fine cloth. Dragon Head fine cloth rose sharply by 9,000 yuan per bolt, and Five Blessings also rose by 7,000 yuan. Other brands of fine cloth increased by varying amounts of 4-5,000 yuan. Chick and Shilin cloth, due to abundant supply and sluggish sales, fell by 5,000 yuan per bolt. Bleached cloth and poplin were dull for both local and external customers, and fell uniformly.</p>
<h3>Ramie Sales Are Brisk and Prices are High</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the small amount of ramie arriving and brisk sales, prices rose uniformly today. White ramie rose from 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per shi dan, green ramie from 250,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan, and yellow ramie from 100,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. Ramie rose from 210,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan. Other items such as linen and raw flax also increased by as much as 100,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Building Materials Rise in Price</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] American cement is becoming scarce, and people are competing to buy it wholesale. There is a severe shortage in the market, and there has been no market for many days. Only Ma Pi cement is being traded in the market, with a price of 80,000 to 82,000 yuan per 100 kg bag. Blue bricks have risen from 1.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan per 10,000 pieces. Blue tiles have risen from 1 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan per 10,000 pieces, and machine-made red tiles have reached around 1 million yuan per 1,000 pieces. The rise in lime prices is still moderate, due to excessive arrivals, with each dan rising only from 44,000 yuan to 46,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Market Atmosphere is Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric markets on Changle Road and Qipan Street were all tight, and most merchants were unwilling to quote prices. Since the US dollar exchange rate was adjusted to 12,000 yuan, the impact on the cost of woolen fabric is quite significant. In general, it is necessary to see to what extent the factory prices increase before one can be confident in trading again. Therefore, some stores limit each person to one piece of clothing material. Buyers, due to both financial constraints and price increases and slow sales, can only wait and see.</p>
<h3>Post-War Exports of Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Valued at US$67 Million</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 18th, Reconstruction Society] According to an announcement today by the Foreign Trade Section of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has exported 88,627 bales of raw silk since the end of the war until February 7th, valued at US$66,577,000, of which 35,021 bales (valued at US$30,641,000) have been traded. The buying countries are the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and New Zealand. As of February 7th, the trading situation is as follows: 84,475 bales shipped to the United States and 26,396 bales traded (US$25,233,000), 3,212 bales shipped to and traded with Great Britain (US$3,219,000), and 940 bales shipped to and traded with Australia and New Zealand (US$118,900). According to Harry Cheech of the Foreign Trade Section, the price of raw silk in 1947 was originally expected to be $6 per pound, but it has fallen to $4.65 per pound.</p>
<h3>Officials from the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs Come to Shanghai to Inspect the Organization of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Qu Jing Shen, section chief of the Economic Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Tang Kuan, commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, recently came to Shanghai from the capital to inspect the organization of trade associations in the city. On the 18th, accompanied by Section Chief Wu of the Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Organization Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, they met with Xu Ji Qing, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and scheduled a discussion with the responsible persons of the major industrial and commercial trade associations this afternoon, inquiring about the development of each association and providing guidance on how to coordinate future association affairs with national policy.</p>
<h3>Kai-Luan Coal Dust Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>The Fuel Committee's coal transport ship "Fuxing" has arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao yesterday and is berthed at buoy number 32, carrying 5,720 tons of Kai-Luan coal dust.</p>
<h3>Sample Lists of Goods from Various Commercial Firms Must Affix Stamps According to Delivery Invoices</h3>
<p>Regarding the fact that the sample lists of goods from various stores only state the name of the goods and do not include the unit price or total value, and whether stamps should be affixed, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously forwarded a letter to the Direct Taxation Bureau for verification and reply. According to news from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the tax bureau has forwarded a request for instructions to the higher authorities in Shanghai. If the parties concerned cannot provide appropriate proof to confirm that the goods have not been traded or a separate invoice has been issued, the document is of the nature of a delivery invoice and should be stamped according to regulations. If the value is not stated, it should also be handled in accordance with Article 17 of the Stamp Tax Law.</p>
<h3>China Trust Distributes Rayon: Total of 292 Cases</h3>
<p>Allocation Price Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The China Trust Bureau distributed rayon for the 22nd time yesterday, approving 331 silk weaving companies and distributing a total of 292 cases of A-grade rayon from Takayama and Early Day. The allocation price remained unchanged, with Takayama rayon at 2.75 million yuan per case, and Early Day A-grade rayon also at 2.75 million yuan per case.</p>
<h3>Additional Fees to be Collected on Imported Goods from February 6th to February 17th</h3>
<p>According to information from the Jianghai Customs, all goods arriving at various ports on or after February 6th of this year and declared for import before February 17th shall be subject to import duties and surcharges at the old exchange rate. Goods declared for import from February 17th onwards shall only be subject to import duties at the new exchange rate, and no surcharges shall be collected.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Has Appointed Personnel to Study the Issuance of Shares by State-Owned Enterprises</h3>
<p>Regarding Item D of the first item of the Emergency Economic Measures Plan, all state-owned production enterprises, except those that belong to the heavy industry sector and have significant special circumstances that require government operation, should be sold or sold to private operators in a phased manner by issuing shares. It is learned that the Executive Yuan has appointed Vice President Weng Wen Hao, Minister Yu Hong Jun, Minister Wang Yun Wu, Chairman Qian Chang Zhao, Director Liu Gong Yun, General Manager Shu Yun Zhang, and invited Li Fu Sun, Chen Guang Fu, Xu Ji Guang, Qin Run Qing, Xu Guang Chi, Hu Yun Qiu, and Yang Xi Ren to form a committee, convened by Vice President Weng, to promptly study the methods and procedures for handling the matters within the scope of the above items, and to submit implementation measures for approval.</p>
<h3>Prices of Major Export Goods in China Show Mixed Trends: Hog Bristles and Tung Oil are Consistently Prosperous</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange rate, the prices of major export goods in China have either risen or fallen. Among them, hog bristles, tung oil, tea, and fur have all risen by several tenths to onefold. Silk and eggs have slightly declined. The prices of various goods on Saturday of last week are compared with yesterday's prices below:</p>
<p>Hog Bristles: The price per dan was 1.67 million yuan last Saturday, and yesterday's price was 2.8 million yuan, an increase of 60%. However, most holders are unwilling to sell, so purchasing is difficult. Currently, the foreign prices of hog bristles have all slightly decreased. Exporting at the current market price yields a profit of 1% or 2%. Most exporters are watching and waiting, planning to export after the foreign prices stabilize.</p>
<p>Tung Oil: The price was set at 460,000 yuan per dan at a public meeting last Saturday, and there was no change yesterday. However, most tung oil merchants are unwilling to sell at that price, so purchasing is not easy. The export situation is the same as hog bristles.</p>
<p>Tea and Leather Show Improvement</p>
<p>The price of tea has changed drastically. The price of Wenzhou tea was 200,000 yuan per dan last week, but it has risen to more than 400,000 yuan yesterday, an increase of more than onefold. The price is unusually high and purchasing is difficult, so exporting is still difficult.</p>
<p>The average increase in leather is 40%. Hankou sheepskin was 550,000 yuan per dan last Saturday, and 900,000 yuan yesterday. Sichuan sheepskin was 700,000 yuan per dan last Saturday, and 1.25 million yuan yesterday. The price of cowhide last Saturday was 700,000 yuan per dan for large weight, 800,000 yuan for medium weight, and 1.2 million yuan for small weight. Yesterday's prices were 1 million yuan for large weight, 1.2 million yuan for medium weight, and 1.8 million yuan for small weight. Because the leather production season only has two months left, goods are scarce and prices are high. The export profit is better than other goods, about 5%, and many people are currently exporting.</p>
<p>The prices of wool products: The price of wool last Saturday was 40,000 yuan per 100 jin, and it rose to between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan yesterday. The price of duck feathers last Saturday was 280,000 yuan per dan, and it reached 300,000 yuan yesterday. Among them, wool has little foreign demand, so there is little export. Although duck feathers and hair can be exported, few large-scale exports.</p>
<p>Silk and Eggs Slightly Decline</p>
<p>The price of raw silk: The price of C grade last Saturday was 8.15 million yuan per dan, and D grade was 7.8 million yuan. Yesterday's prices were 8 million yuan for C grade and 7.6 million yuan for D grade, all slightly declining. The price of silk: 40-inch satin was 24,500 yuan per yard, and interwoven soft satin was 12,000 yuan per yard. The market prices last Saturday and yesterday were similar. In the past, silk exports all had to suffer losses. After this foreign exchange revision, there are no losses.</p>
<p>The prices of eggs: The price of private eggs last Saturday was 370,000 yuan per 100 shi jin, duck eggs were 350,000 yuan for 1,000 large, 330,000 yuan for medium, and 300,000 yuan for small. Yesterday's market prices were 330,000 yuan for chicken eggs per 100 jin, 340,000 yuan for 1,000 large duck eggs, and 260,000 yuan for small duck eggs, all declining uniformly. According to a certain egg company, egg prices may still fall in the future, so its export is relatively optimistic.</p>

<h3>Jinan Air News, 12th; Special Correspondent Li Tian: The Shandong War Situation After the Recapture of Linyi; The Xuzhou Campaign Has Reached its End; The Southern Shandong Campaign Has Officially Begun</h3>
<p>The development of this war situation, in which the main force of the Communist army from northern Jiangsu sneaked into southern Shandong, and the main force of Liu Bocheng's troops south of the Longhai Railway retreated to western Shandong, undoubtedly shows that our Communist army's attempt to encircle Xuzhou has been crushed. The Xuzhou Campaign has reached its end, and the Southern Shandong Campaign, initiated by the National Army, should be taking its place.</p>
<p>The operational area of the so-called Southern Shandong Campaign should include the vast area east from the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Shandong to the edge of the Yellow Sea, west to the area north of the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway, and south of the Yellow River and the Jiaoji Railway. In this operational area, the National Army is launching a combined offensive with three powerful forces. Therefore, judging from the current situation, this operational area can be clearly divided into three theaters:</p>
<p>First, the main theater, centered on Linyi, east to the coast, and west to Linzhao (east of the Jinpu Railway). The Communist army has concentrated fifteen divisions, two independent brigades, and two columns, totaling about 200,000 people.</p>
<p>Second, the first branch of the theater, which is south from the Zibo branch of the Jiaoji Railway, to Laiwu and Xintai, with the aim of encircling the back of Linyi. The Communist army has coordinated three divisions, two security brigades, and two independent regiments here, totaling 50,000 people.</p>
<p>Third, the second branch of the theater, which is west of the Jinpu Railway, north of the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway, and south of the Yellow River. The Communist army has concentrated five columns and one independent brigade in this area, totaling about 60,000 people. In addition, in Jiaodong, which can threaten the rear of the National Army's first theater, the Communist army has 70,000 troops stationed; and in northern Shandong, 50,000 troops are stationed. The total number of regular Communist troops in the entire Shandong area has reached 430,000. The Communist Party, which claims to have 1.2 million regular troops, has already used more than one-third of its capital on the Shandong battlefield, making a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>As for the National Army's forces, their numbers may be slightly lower than the Communist army's, but one thing is the same: both sides have arranged their main forces in the main theater on the front of southern Shandong. The National Army's initial target is Linyi. The Communist army initially launched the Xuzhou Campaign with the strategic intention of ensuring Linyi with an offensive defense. Why is Linyi worthy of becoming the National Army's main attack target? And why is Linyi worthy of the Communist army ensuring it with the largest force? The importance of Linyi seems to necessitate an additional comment here.</p>
<p>General Wang Yaowu on the Front Line in Southern Shandong</p>
<p>The Importance of Linyi is Second Only to Yan'an, and Higher than Jiamusi</p>
<p>Linyi is an important town in southern Shandong, and has the most significant value in terms of military geography. As early as the Anti-Japanese War in 1938, the victory of the National Army's Taierzhuang victory initially relied on the victory of the late General Zhang Zizhong in the Battle of Linyi. This time, the Communist army launched the Xuzhou Campaign, and its left-wing corps, commanded by Chen Yi and Su Yu, also used Linyi as their largest base. In addition, Linyi has long been one of the three major base areas of the Chinese Communist Party in recent years (the other two are Yan'an and Jiamusi in the Northeast). It is the base area of the New Fourth Army, the second strongest force of the Communist army, and also the location of the CCP's East China Bureau, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government, and the Shandong Military Region. In short, it is the center of the CCP's party, government, and military south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River. It is the CCP's most important base east of Yan'an. Its importance to the CCP is second only to Yan'an and higher than Jiamusi. Therefore, the gains and losses of Linyi for the Communist army, whether in terms of military or political significance, far exceed those of northern Jiangsu and Zhangjiakou, and even more so the gains and losses of the battles of Siping Street and Changchun in April and May of last year. Therefore, Linyi has become a place that the Communist army must defend, and the National Army, in order to defeat its main force, has "attacked where it must defend," and the great battle has begun!</p>
<p>The war is still proceeding intensely. Since the 12th of this month, the National Army has advanced to Lijiazhuang, 45 li south of Linyi. All agencies in Linyi City have moved north, and all the Communist army has withdrawn to the mountains on both sides. Linyi City has long been an empty city. Therefore, the National Army is stationed in the city walls while clearing the Communist army in the mountains on both sides. The initial defeat of the Communist army is also predetermined by fate. However, what surrounds the hearts of the people of the country is no longer the issue of the recovery of Linyi, but the question of where the Communist army will go after withdrawing from Linyi? Where will the National Army go after occupying Linyi? When will the Southern Shandong Campaign end?</p>
<h3>How Will the War Continue After the National Army Recaptures Linyi?</h3>
<p>Regarding the former, the Communist army in the encirclement in southern Shandong originally had the following four possible actions: (1) escape to the mountains, (2) retreat to Jiaodong, (3) cross the Jinpu Railway and merge with Liu Bocheng's force on the north bank of the Yellow River, (4) retreat to northern Jiangsu. Among the four, the first possibility was originally the greatest, but since the National Army on the northern route recovered Laiwu on the 4th, and occupied Xintai on the 8th, and broke into the heart of the Yimeng Mountain area, its attempt to escape to the mountains has had to increase its concerns. The Communist army concentrated its main force to attack Hao Pengju's troops the week before, and although it gained some small advantages, after the National Army's flanking attack, the dream of retreating to northern Jiangsu was clearly shattered. (But its opportunistic attacks to seize the National Army's weapons to expand its armed capital has clearly partially achieved its purpose). As for retreating to Jiaodong, it is like a mouse drilling into a cow's horn, which can only be secured temporarily. Unless absolutely necessary, the Communist army will never do this. As for crossing the Jinpu Railway and crossing the Yellow River to merge with Liu Bocheng's force, it will naturally be considered subjectively that the Yimeng and Taishan mountain areas have inflicted some losses on the National Army, and objectively it is impossible to gain a foothold after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army on three sides. Therefore, judging from the evolution of the war, there may still be a great battle in the Yimeng and Taishan mountain areas. The capture of Linyi is just a prelude to the Southern Shandong Campaign, or at most a conclusion to one stage, but not a closing ceremony.</p>
<p>As for how the National Army will continue the war after occupying Linyi, according to the analysis results of qualified military observers, it should not be outside of the following three plans: (1) Decide according to the whereabouts of the main force of the Communist army, not focusing on the gains and losses of one city and one place, but mainly on capturing and annihilating its main force. This is precisely the opposite of the Communist army's basic strategic principle of preserving strength and avoiding decisive battles. (2) After recovering Linyi and making some repairs, continue to move north with the main force and join forces with the National Army moving south from Xintai in Mengyin, dividing the Communist army's Yimeng base area into two, and then sweeping towards both wings to cooperate with the National Army in northern Shandong to complete the two encirclements and annihilate it. (3) Adopt a strategy of large encirclement. The National Army in the Linyi area only retains a force sufficient to block the Communist army from fleeing south and restrain the Communist army from transferring elsewhere, and instead transfers the main force to western Shandong, taking advantage of the thousands of miles of fertile land in western Shandong, a vast plain, which is conducive to both marching and supply. First, the main force of Liu Bocheng's troops is defeated, and then driven to the north of the Yellow River or the Yimeng Mountain area and the Taishan Mountain area east of the Jinpu Railway, so that it merges with Chen Yi. In this way, after the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway is opened, it is pressed from three sides, gradually reducing the encirclement. The Communist army is then annihilated. These three plans can be adopted simultaneously. The focus of the problem is only the main force, that is, whether the main theater is changed.</p>
<h3>When Will the Southern Shandong Campaign End? When Can the Xuji Section be Opened?</h3>
<p>If someone must ask how long it will take for the Southern Shandong Campaign to end, it depends entirely on whether the Communist forces are increasing their troops again and how the two sides are conducting operations, strategic deployment, and tactical combat. If the National Army is not urgently capturing the main force of the Communist army, and the main hope is to restore the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway, then if the third plan described above is followed, it should not exceed three months. The disaster of the Jiaoji Railway, on the contrary, will probably deepen with the intensification of the Southern Shandong Campaign. Therefore, Jinan's land-based contact with the outside world may be cut off at any time, but this only shows that it may become an isolated city, but it will never become a second Changchun. Commander Wang Yaowu, who bears this heaviest burden, is using his highest wisdom, greatest efforts, and deepest perseverance to cope with the current situation with this most limited force.</p>
<h3>France: Increased Production Plan</h3>
<p>— Marseilles, April 4th Airmail — Special Correspondent Hong Fu</p>
<p>Since the end of the Second World War, various countries, recognizing the needs of the times, have been determined to increase production efficiency. The Russian Five-Year Plan is one such example. Jean Monnet, Chairman of the French Modernization Production Committee, recently announced a grand plan for reforming production methods, requiring seven or eight years of effort to achieve self-reliance. The economic life of a country is no different from that of a family or an individual. Before the war, France was like a wealthy household, able to live comfortably by investing abroad. At that time, all French production enterprises could rely on profits from foreign deposits to cope. Now, war debts are piled up, and French funds deposited abroad must be used to offset wartime military expenditures obtained from foreign countries. Like a family or an individual, from rich to poor, with nothing to rely on, only work can ensure survival. Only by relying on domestic efforts to produce can surplus be obtained and used for production enterprises. This is the reason why French production must be rapidly increased.</p>
<p>The work efficiency of both French industry and agriculture has always been lower than that of other countries. Before the war, the productivity of a French worker was only one-third that of a well-trained and well-nourished American worker, and only two-thirds that of a British worker. Moreover, since the outbreak of the World War, one-third of France's total production capacity has been stagnant. Now, the implementation of a new work plan will not only replace old tools with new ones, but also adopt the most refined new methods. The primary goal of this plan is to quickly rebuild the areas destroyed during the war, and more importantly, to greatly increase production levels compared to pre-war levels.</p>
<p>Heavy industry occupies a particularly important position in the plan to reform production. A country without heavy industry can never rely on its own military equipment to maintain long-term security. The burden of military equipment should not be too high, but production capacity must be increased in a timely manner. In today's world, if heavy industry does not advance rapidly, it will inevitably decline quickly. If it is not modernized, it will inevitably collapse. According to the schedule predetermined by the Monnet Plan, heavy industries such as coal, electricity, steel, pig iron, trains, freight cars, and shipyards in France must reach the level of production in 1938 by the end of 1947. Subsequently, in the first half of 1948, it must rise to the highest point reached in 1929, which is 25% higher than the level of 1938. By 1950, it must be 25% higher than the peak period of 1929. It is predicted that France must produce 475,000 cars in 1950. The required gasoline will be a huge amount. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish a fleet of oil tanker vessels traveling to and from the sea, and to lay oil pipelines from Le Havre port in the north to Paris in the south. Other agricultural production will also be ordered to increase dramatically. The methods of increasing agricultural production are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the areas for wheat, white beets, and sugar beet fields are smaller than before, but they can have larger harvests than before. It is clear that the neglect of new farming methods cannot be ignored when increasing agricultural production. In China, agricultural affairs are waiting to be developed, and water conservancy is particularly urgent. The plan for sufficient clothing and food must first be preceded by enriching agriculture and preventing floods. The good practices of advanced countries are available and there are many that can be learned from.</p>
<p>France was originally good at self-sufficiency. Now that the country has gone from rich to poor, the people must work hard to make a living. It is estimated that by the end of 1947, 480,000 workers will be needed for France to carry out this plan. In the three years that follow, 220,000 workers should be added, plus 500,000 prisoners of war who have not been sent out of France. The total of these three items is that by 1950, 1.2 million people will have to be employed. Once this plan is implemented, the labor market throughout France must be strictly controlled, and no one without a specific job is allowed to engage in other private businesses to avoid working. If the number of people is still insufficient, female workers must be added. At the same time, foreign immigrants residing in France must also be recruited. This refers to a 48-hour week system. If a new system is adopted, changing to a 44-hour week, it is said that another 500,000 workers will need to be found to be sufficient. What France now needs to import from foreign countries, in addition to indispensable daily necessities, are the machines and tools used to increase production. It is estimated that the cost of changing and deploying this new industry in the four years from 1947 to 1950 will be 3 trillion francs. This is equal to the total annual revenue of the current French government. This can be raised gradually in the next four years. But if new methods are indeed used to increase production, the national tourism revenue in 1950 can be increased to 3.7 trillion francs. The estimated investments in various sectors are listed below: Attached to this committee are small committees in 18 departments, which are responsible for researching various specialized issues and submitting their findings to the general meeting for approval and implementation. With a clear outline and detailed items, everything is in order. The investment amounts estimated in the table above require that the currency and commodity prices be stable at a certain level without fluctuations. There must also be no communist elements causing strikes and other disputes in the middle, so that progress can be made step by step and day by day. Happiness and suffering in the world are often cyclical. When a country is poor, the people must use their labor to fulfill their obligations as a citizen. The temperament of the French people is like that of the Chinese. When faced with great difficulties, there are always brave generals and resourceful advisors. Sometimes, it may still not be possible to be completely confident of victory. The problem lies in the difficulty of uniting the people's hearts.</p>

<p>Questioning the Fee for Repairing Water Pipes</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I live at No. 125, Chongde Road, in this city. Starting on the 12th of this month, all residents in this lane felt that the water supply was not smooth, and on the 14th, it was completely cut off. Later, it was learned that workers were digging in the road to repair the main water pipe, which had rotted and cracked. After the work was completed on the 15th, there was still no water. Suddenly, someone went door-to-door saying that an agreement had been reached with the water company that the lane should pay over 1.2 million national currency, with each household paying over 40,000 yuan. They also said that if payment was delayed, the water supply would be cut off. After my family paid, we only received a private receipt. I wonder if the cost of repairing the main water pipe in the road by the company should be borne by nearby users. If there is such a rule, the company should directly send personnel to issue receipts for collection. Why do we need to pay first and then get water? This inevitably opens the door for petty criminals to extort money. I would like to ask the French-owned Water and Electricity Company to investigate and announce the facts to dispel public doubts. (Acheng, Chongde Road)</p>
<p>A Suggestion to Reduce Tram Congestion Editor:</p>
<p>The population of Shanghai has increased compared to before the war, but the number of trams in the city has not increased. Therefore, passengers are very crowded at each stop. I believe that if the front door of the existing trams is used exclusively for passengers to board, and the rear door is used exclusively for passengers to disembark, this would reduce the degree of congestion and save time at each stop. As for the towed cars, because the door width is already wider and can accommodate two people boarding or disembarking side by side, they can remain the same. At a time when the number of trams cannot be increased, this method is easy to implement. I hope that the relevant authorities will order the British and French tram companies to try it out.

<h3>Lack of Railway Locomotives and Cars: Northeastern Transportation Urgently Needs to Be Restored — Shenyang, 12th Airmail</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhao Zhan in Shenyang</p>
<p>Last winter, due to coal shortages and severe cold, the railway transportation in the Northeast was almost frozen. Now that spring is approaching, the question of whether there is hope for improvement in transportation is of concern to the public. The coal problem seems to be less serious than in winter, but because the output is insufficient, it is not without problems. The biggest problem is the severe shortage of railway locomotives and cars. The current quantity is less than one-tenth of what it was before the restoration.</p>
<p>Before the restoration, there were originally 4,000 locomotives on the railways in Northeast China, but now there are only 300 left. There were originally 5,000 passenger cars, but now there are only over 250 left. There were originally 40,000 freight cars, but now there are only over 5,000 left, and only 3,000 are usable. Most of the existing locomotives are dilapidated and have very low operating efficiency.</p>
<p>According to people in the transportation industry, because the Northeast Railway suffered the greatest losses, coupled with constant sabotage by the Communist army, it will not be easy to restore the previous transportation capacity. It seems that it cannot be done in three to five years. According to the Railway Bureau's announcement, as of now, the national railways in the Northeast region that have been taken over by the National Army total 4,274 kilometers, of which 3,249 kilometers have been repaired and opened to traffic. The Northeast Railway originally had over 11,000 kilometers, but currently, only slightly more than one-third of what it was before the restoration is open to traffic.</p>
<p>Regarding the solution to the shortage of locomotives and cars, it has recently been heard that the Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate 50 locomotives and 800 cars. However, there is no definite date for when they will arrive. If this batch of locomotives arrives, it will be a small supplement to transportation, because the need to restore freight transportation is urgent, and the severity of the transportation problem is therefore increasing.</p>
<h3>Rising Wind in Guangzhou: Chaotic Situation Tends to Stabilize Under Emergency Economic Measures</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 12th Airmail — Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>In the past few days, as gold and foreign currencies have been galloping like unbridled wild horses, grain prices have also been rising along with the minute hand on the clock, and other commodity prices have also been increasing step by step. This "rise, rise!" sound wave has been pressing on the million-plus citizens of Guangzhou almost to the point of suffocation. They seem to be drifting in a small boat on the vast sea, and if they encounter a ruthless storm, they don't know where the shore is! Indeed, a terrifying atmosphere is now enveloping the entire city. The citizens are watching the crazy jumps of commodity prices, and they are all trembling with fear. People walking on the streets have pale faces with panicked expressions. Everywhere you can hear cries of mutual suffering. This chaotic situation is indeed an unprecedented phenomenon since Guangzhou's restoration.</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Hong, as the financial market of Guangzhou, seems to have become the place that determines the fate of over a million citizens. These days, it has been unprecedentedly tense and lively, with crowds of people all day long, squeezing back and forth. Even people who are usually not interested in financial ups and downs have gone there these days to listen to the news and see the market trends, because the dynamics of this market will directly affect everyone's life! Therefore, the eyes of all the citizens of the city are involuntarily focused on Thirteenth Hong Road. However, the more people pay attention to this financial market, the more restless people become when they see the crazy rise of gold and foreign currencies. Commercial firms with some funds have rushed to buy gold and foreign currencies to store, and even ordinary people would never keep the national currency that is depreciating minute by minute! So they rush to buy! buy! The gold and foreign currencies in the entire Thirteenth Hong have been snapped up, and coupled with the fact that some speculators are fanning the flames, buying in large quantities but not releasing, how could there not be a crazy rise? Let's first look at the prices last week: the highest gold price was no more than 540,000, and the Hong Kong dollar was only 1,500. But on February 11, the gold price rose to 1.4 million, and the Hong Kong dollar reached a maximum of 3,500. In just one week, the rise reached over 130 percent! Especially on February 10 and 11, the price of gold and foreign currencies jumped by more than 100,000 yuan every day. At the same time, grain prices were also pulled up, and the speed of progress was even faster. From 50,000 per unit, it rose sharply to a maximum of 280,000, and the rice shop owners were not very willing to sell. Other daily necessities, of course, followed suit. How could people not tremble in such a drastically changing chaotic state?</p>
<p>In the midst of financial excitement and crazy commodity price increases, Guangzhou's industry and commerce suffered the greatest blow, and most of them were close to a standstill. Because finance is changing rapidly and cannot be grasped, it is difficult for all industries to buy and sell. Should they keep the goods in stock? They lack the funds to circulate. Should they sell the goods? Holding the national currency will depreciate. Therefore, there have been very few transactions of various goods in the past week. And those related to industrial properties have suffered even more. Because the prices of various industrial raw materials have soared, the cost of finished products has naturally increased. After the factory manufactures sell their products, they often cannot make up for the value of the raw materials. In addition, there are several industries where workers are also demanding wage increases. On the workers' side, it cannot be said to be unreasonable to demand wage increases due to the impact of rising living costs, but most of the factories are really unable to bear it. Under such circumstances, they can only close down! Just to say that in this city's rubber factory, more than 30 have gone bankrupt so far, accounting for one-third of the city's rubber factories. Other industries are also preparing to close down. If there is no turning point in the short term, the future of Guangzhou's industry and commerce is feared to be even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>Not long ago, after the adjustment and reform of Guangzhou's public buses, they were completely renewed, which was convenient for the citizens. This was good news. However, the situation has been different in the past few days! The city's public buses have gone from partial suspension to almost complete suspension! The reason, needless to say, is also due to financial fluctuations.</p>
<p>In addition to industry and commerce, Guangzhou's cultural undertakings are also facing bankruptcy due to the impact of this round of crazy commodity price increases! Let's start with the newspaper industry! Since the announcement of restrictions on the import of foreign paper and the increase in foreign paper taxes, the price of foreign paper has soared, and with the soaring foreign currencies, the price of foreign paper has risen even more fiercely. In less than half a month, white newspaper paper rose from over 30,000 yuan per ream (500 large sheets) to 200,000 yuan, a difference of more than six times! At the same time, printing technicians also demanded a wage increase of over 100 percent at this time, followed by the increase in rice prices and other materials. However, the price of newspapers cannot be increased as quickly as other items. Advertising fees are too high when industry and commerce are facing difficulties. Now, the "Da Guang," "Yue Hua," "Guo Hua," "Shang Bao," and other newspapers that publish two sheets are priced at 500 yuan per copy, and the rest that publish one and a half sheets are also sold for 400 yuan. But the newspaper price still cannot catch up with other commodity prices, which makes the people in charge of the newspapers feel unable to support it! Recently, the "Da Hua Daily," "Tian Xing News," and "English New News" have already stopped publishing. I am afraid that several more will not be able to hold out within this week! Other industries such as bookstores and printing industries have also been almost completely suspended due to the excessively high prices of paper, rice, and wages! Even schools! During this spring season, many old students in schools at all levels have stopped attending, and very few new students have applied for admission. This is certainly because the tuition fees of private schools are too high, but the main reason is probably that people's lives are too difficult! Therefore, in general, the future of Guangzhou's cultural undertakings is truly a dark shadow!</p>
<p>In short, in the past few days in Guangzhou, the financial situation has been unprecedentedly turbulent, industry and commerce have been crushed, cultural undertakings are on the verge of danger, people are extremely panic-stricken, and crises are lurking everywhere in society. These are undeniable facts. Are we just going to let it develop like this? The question lies in the measures and strength of the authorities. We all know that this round of commodity price increases is due to financial fluctuations, and a part of the financial fluctuations is affected by fluctuations in other places, but the intentional stirring up trouble by local financial speculators to make people discriminate against the national currency is also a major reason. Therefore, as long as the authorities can exert their strength to stop the activities of these speculators and stabilize the financial situation, all problems can be solved. Let's see: since the provincial government issued emergency measures yesterday (11th), ordering a complete stop to the buying and selling of foreign currencies and gold, prohibiting the issuance and circulation of promissory notes and silver receipts issued by all money and silver shops, and prohibiting the export of gold and silver, all buying and selling transactions and contracts must not use gold and foreign currencies as the standard, and stipulating various severe penalties. At the same time, regarding the food supply: the headquarters and the provincial government have also consulted and decided on emergency measures for food supply: (1) Retail rice merchants in Guangzhou are ordered to sell grain at the stated price, and violators will be severely punished; (2) Negotiated pricing will be implemented in the Guangzhou rice market to supply retail merchants; (3) Negotiated pricing will be implemented at the Guangzhou grain customs to supply rice merchants and wholesalers; (4) It is stipulated that each county must transport a large amount of grain to Guangzhou for sale. These orders have had a great response as soon as they were issued. The price of gold immediately fell, the Hong Kong dollar also fell back, and grain prices also dropped. This all shows the strength of the authorities. However, although the prices of gold, foreign currencies, and grain have fallen, they are still more than double what they were before this round of price increases. Therefore, the people's lives are still difficult to relieve, and society has not yet returned to a state of stability. This is of course to be hoped for with greater efforts from the authorities!</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Basin Agricultural Irrigation (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Sun Fu Shi</p>
<p>For farmlands located in valleys and sloping terrains, the water source comes from natural rivers (supplemented by ponds when necessary). Due to the steeper slopes, water can be directed into the fields. There are two methods:</p>
<p>(1) Weirs and Canals</p>
<p>This method involves constructing a weir to dam the river, diverting a portion or all of the river's water into canals that lead to the fields. The Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which diverts water from the Min River to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, is a prime example of this method. The Hanzhong irrigation area in the upper reaches of the Han River and its tributaries is second in importance. This method is also widely used in the areas of southern Hunan and Jiangxi, as well as southern Anhui and western Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(2) Dragon Spine Water Lift (Treadwheel Pumps)</p>
<p>This method involves building a weir to raise the water level. A waterway is left along the riverbank, where a dragon spine water lift (treadwheel pump) is installed. The impact of the water flow drives the wheel, lifting water for irrigation. This is most suitable for farmlands along rapid streams that are not extensive.</p>
<p>The dragon spine water lift is made with a bamboo wheel ranging from six to twenty-one feet in diameter, depending on the height to which the water needs to be raised. The wheel is fitted with vanes and dozens of bamboo tubes around its circumference, each tube holding approximately half to three-quarters of a liter of water. The wheel's vanes are pushed by the water, causing it to rotate. The tubes on the rotating wheel scoop up water and lift it upwards. At the highest point, the water is discharged into a wooden trough, which then flows into the fields. Its structure is extremely simple, mainly using bamboo and wood, without any metal parts.</p>
<p>Dragon spine water lifts are very common in Sichuan, Guizhou, northern Guangxi, western Hunan, southern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>(3) Pond Fields</p>
<p>Ponds are about one mu in size (approximately 667 square meters) and two to three meters deep, storing water from mountain streams. Because seepage is minimal, water is easily conserved. Larger ponds can irrigate twenty to thirty mu of land, while smaller ones irrigate only a few mu. In the areas of Ankang and Hanyin, pond fields are abundant. From a distance, the glistening water connects with the sky, and the land is filled with ponds.</p>
<p>The Hanzhong irrigation area is the best representation of valley and sloping farmland irrigation in the Yangtze River basin. Separated by the Qinling Mountains, it avoids the cold and drought of the Yellow River basin. The soil is sticky and black, with low permeability. All these conditions are similar to those in the Sichuan Basin, with paddy fields throughout the region. The irrigation methods are mainly weirs and canals, supplemented by dragon spine water lifts and ponds. However, rainfall is relatively low, around 600 millimeters annually, with more than 50% occurring in summer. The water from the Han River itself is rarely used for irrigation. The benefits of irrigation come entirely from its tributaries. The most important are: the Yangjia River in Mian County; the Lian River, Bao River, and Leng River in Baocheng and Nanzheng; the Xu River in Chenggu and Yangxian; the Dang River, Mabu River, You River, and Jin River in Yangxian; the Muma River, Xiaoxia River, Faxi River, Fadong River, and Fengqu River in Xixiang; the Chi River in Shiquan; the Yue River and its tributaries in Hanyin; the Heng River and Huangyang River in Ankang; and the Ba River in Xunyang. The situation is as shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Tianfen West Weir  1,500</p>
<p>Yangjia River  Yangjia River Various Weirs  Total 6,000</p>
<p>Total  208,860 Mu</p>
<p>The above table lists the larger weirs. Other smaller weirs are not included. The total is about 300,000 mu, together with pond fields, it should be around 400,000 mu. Among the rivers, the weirs of the Bao River are the most uniform and organized. The Shanhe Weir outside the east gate of Baocheng is the largest in Hanzhong, rumored to have been built by Xiao He and Cao Shen of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Second to the Shanhe Weir is the Xu River weirs, but their construction is many times more difficult, and the annual cost of repairing the weirs is considerable.</p>
<p>In the mountainous areas of Hanzhong, people build small, level plots in the valleys. If water can be diverted, rice is planted; if not, corn is planted. Therefore, the irrigated land is fragmented, but in aggregate, it is quite impressive. In Xunyang County, 3,600 to 3,700 mu are irrigated, mostly benefiting from the Xun River. In Zhen'an, over 3,000 mu are irrigated, mostly from the Xun River and Jinjing River, followed by the Qianyou River. In Liuba, less than 1,000 mu are irrigated, mostly from the Wuwen River and Zijin River. Feng County only has 300 mu of paddy fields, mostly irrigated by the An River. The Gudao River is flat and sandy and lacks irrigation benefits.</p>
<p>In order to maintain weir and canal projects, allocate irrigation water, and increase irrigated area, management is extremely important due to the large scale of the weirs and canals. During the Ming Dynasty, a Vice Prefect was established in the Yingzhong area, specializing in managing water conservancy in the twelve counties of Hanzhong, a system continued in the early Qing Dynasty. During the Jiaqing era, a Water Conservancy Office was established, managed by the Experience Secretary of Hanzhong Prefecture, with its scope changed to the four counties of Nanbaocheng and Yang. Since the Republic of China, each county government has been responsible, but in practice, the people manage it themselves. If there are disputes, the county government temporarily sends personnel to investigate and handle them. Most of these officials are inexperienced and have no specific responsibilities, resulting in uneven water allocation, damaged inlets, silted canals, incomplete embankments, and poorly maintained weirs. The situation is quite appalling. In 1934, the Shaanxi Provincial Government established the Southern Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau in Nanzheng to manage the weirs in the seven counties of Nan, Bao, Mian, Cheng, Yang, Xi, and Liu.</p>
<p>The new-style weir and canal projects created in the Southern Shaanxi region include the Han-Hui, Bao-Hui, and Xu-Hui canals. The following describes them in general terms:</p>
<p>The Han-Hui Canal diverts water from the Han River at Gaojiaquan in Mian County to irrigate 110,000 mu of land in the three counties of Mian County, Baocheng, and Nanzheng. The design began in 1924 but was halted due to turmoil. Redesign and construction resumed in 1938, with an estimated cost of over 710,000 yuan. Due to the difficulty of procuring and transporting materials and the continuous lack of funds, the project progressed slowly. After repeated additions, the total cost reached 1.9 million yuan, and it was completed in May 1941. The farmland in the area benefited greatly, and the farmers were all overjoyed.</p>
<p>The Bao-Hui Canal diverts water from the Heilongjiang River outside Baocheng to irrigate 150,000 mu of land in Baocheng, Nanzheng, and other counties. Surveying and design began in the spring of 1939, and construction began in September of the same year. However, due to the war, funds, workers, and materials were all in short supply, delaying the project. It was not completed until 1942, adding much beauty to the rivers and mountains of Southern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>The Xu-Hui Canal diverts water from the Xu River in Chenggu to irrigate 150,000 mu of farmland in Chenggu County. Surveying and design were also completed early in 1939. Due to the lack of manpower and financial resources, construction did not begin immediately. After the Han-Hui Canal released water in 1941 and the results were remarkable, the farmers' faith grew stronger. Local gentry jointly requested that construction begin as soon as possible, and local authorities also repeatedly urged them to start work in September of that year. However, progress has been slow. Most of the project has now been completed, and water has been partially released. The entire project should be completed this year.</p>

<h3>Please Government, Save the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Weiyan</p>
<p>The publishing industry in China is currently facing a very serious crisis. Due to the rising cost of living, typesetting has risen to 14,000 yuan per thousand characters, and the increase in the price of foreign exchange has pushed the price of newsprint to 120,000-130,000 yuan per ream. Several news newspapers in Shanghai have already suspended publication. The prices of bookstore publications have increased to 1,400 times the original listed price. Now that the government has taken emergency economic measures, who knows what the publishing industry will become in the future?</p>
<p>Originally, in a country like China where the people's livelihood is declining and production is backward, there is not enough time to focus on production and construction. How can we take care of the cultural cause? The need for material is still hundreds of thousands of miles away, and spiritual food will inevitably die! However, our country is a civilized country. On the one hand, we must consolidate the basic level of people's lives in the economic and political fields. At the same time, on the other hand, we must also establish education and cultural undertakings to the spiritual construction of the upper class.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of this month, Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs made a statement saying, "The British currently have strict control over the publication of newspapers and books, and they must be approved by the government before they can be published. At present, China's newspapers compete to expand their coverage, and various yellow books and newspapers are not necessary for publication, so there are measures to restrict paper." After reading it, we feel very doubtful. First, we don't know whether China's publishing industry is as developed as Britain's? Second, we don't know whether a country with a low level of education and culture like China does not need to encourage people to read newspapers and books? Third, is the expansion of newspaper competition a bad phenomenon that the government must restrict? Fourth, can restricting paper restrict unnecessary publications of yellow publications?</p>
<p>We believe that at this time, the government should no longer restrict legitimate publishing businesses. On the contrary, it should encourage it and actively help it. The way to encourage and help is to ask the government to release enough loans to legitimate publishers that are easy to use. In fundamental aspects, it is still as Minister Wang said, developing the paper industry in Thailand. The need for the government to actively assist with how to effectively develop the paper industry. In short, the publishing industry has reached a point where it cannot support itself by relying solely on its own operations. It desperately hopes for government assistance!</p>
<h3>New Trends in Mass Education</h3>
<p>— Luo Gengsheng</p>
<p>Written by Gu Mei Published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>If you are someone who cares about China's future, or a young person who is preparing to lead the masses, you may want to read this "New Trends in Mass Education."</p>
<p>The rise of mass education is motivated by saving China. Look at the large number of illiterates in our country, which has hindered the progress of our country; to create a democratic China, to awaken the masses, we must first make the masses literate, knowledgeable, and organized; and the current schools cannot universally teach the general working class, so the rise of mass education is inevitable! The importance of mass education and the tasks and goals of mass education are explained in detail in this book.</p>
<p>Secondly, the author pointed out that if you want to actually do a little mass education, then you must have sufficient funds and talent. Because the success of every cause, the main factor is the combination of planning, funding, and talent, it is best to add the power of administration, the effectiveness can be greater, and the speed will definitely be faster. These administrative organizations of mass education, the source of talent, and the source of social education funds are all discussed one by one.</p>
<p>In fact, mass education can also be a kind of educational transformation, and it needs to be truly implemented. It is useless to just talk about theory! To summarize all the mass education institutions, according to its teaching methods, it can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Mass Literacy Education: such as mass schools, vocational supplementary schools, etc., it is to give out-of-school masses, supplementary basic education, shallow learners expand their cultural wealth, and more skills and vocational guidance.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive Mass Education; the institutions that use this teaching method include mass education centers, mass education districts, mobile teaching, etc. Because these educational institutions implement a variety of education at the same time, such as mass education centers, in addition to teaching the masses to work, there are also art livelihood and other educational facilities.</p>
<p>(3) Separate Mass Education; this Shi Jiao Jiao divides various mass education separately and teaches only one kind. For example, the hip education center only implements health education, and the science museum only implements mass science education.</p>
<p>With the development of science and the needs of facts, mass education has several new developments:</p>
<p>(1) In order to reduce the consumption of the masses and increase the income of the masses, various cooperatives have been established. The establishment of cooperatives can improve the lives of the masses, and stable livelihoods can enable them to settle down and study, so the cooperative business has a great indirect help to mass education.</p>
<p>(2) Hygiene Education and Health Education: The bodies of the masses in our country are mostly weak, they do not pay attention to hygiene, and they do not know how to treat illnesses. To make the people strong, hygiene and health education are also very important implementations.</p>
<p>(3) Self-Defense Training and Civic Training: The passive aspect is self-defense, and the active aspect is autonomy and construction, which is also organizing the masses.</p>
<p>(4) Film and Broadcasting Education (Electrochemical Education): Film and broadcasting have a great power to influence the masses and are what the education authorities are actively promoting.</p>
<p>Other things such as drama, singing, family education, and childcare, etc., were rarely noticed before, but now they have become new facilities for mass education.</p>
<p>The tide of democracy is surging, democratic countries are being built, and China's mass education is cooperating with the needs of this era, moving towards improving national culture, stabilizing people's livelihood, and promoting civil rights!</p>
<h3>Introducing Student Geography Outline Maps to Geography Teachers</h3>
<p>— Youyun</p>
<p>Compiled by the China History and Geography Chart Compilation Society Published by the Ya Bu Yu Geography Society</p>
<p>The joke in a certain university's geography exam paper that a certain student answered that Shenyang is the provincial capital of Shandong can just reflect how general people's geographical knowledge is today! Therefore, I would like to introduce the China Geography and World Geography Outline Maps recently published by Yaguang Cartographic Society.</p>
<p>An outline map is a map with terrain and symbols but no place names, and the printing is mostly relatively simple. Its function is specifically to give students practice filling in place names, and some people also use it to fill in maps for studying various sciences. Because the price is lower than ordinary maps, all schools and individuals interested in geography are happy to use it. Take it as an exercise to train and memorize place names, and it is indeed of great help in increasing geographical knowledge. However, good outline maps are rare in our country, and they have almost disappeared after the war. Ordinary geography-oriented schools use mimeographing to print their own, but this method is time-consuming, and the content is mostly simple and inaccurate, making it difficult to please.</p>
<p>The China and World Geography Outline Maps published by Da China Bookstore are each 16 pages in size, and their binding and design are exactly the same. Each contains 30 maps, and the content is quite new. All national borders that have been changed after World War II and newly established domestic transportation lines have been collected and included. The notable features are as follows: 1. Provincial and national borders are specially grouped to compensate for the lack of monochrome printing and make the scope still significant. 2. The water surface is indicated by water lines, making the land and sea eye-catching. 3. The drawing is accurate and clear, adding to the reader's pleasure. 4. The printing and paper are better than any previous outline map. However, the proportions of each map are not uniform, which makes it slightly difficult for scholars to compare. The selling price of the map is already very popular, and almost everyone can buy it, but printing a blank paper version to allow scholars to practice multiple times at a lower price seems even more necessary.</p>
<p>To strengthen your geographical foundation, it is best to use outline maps for practice more often.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Plum Villa Collection"</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Written by Wang Ciqing Published by Zhonghua Book Company in Song-style Type</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang Ciqing of Liangxi grew up in a family of nobility, he was free from vulgarity and loved literature and art, and was straightforward and fluent, with a unique and indifferent demeanor. Mr. Tang Weizhi, a national scholar, called him a natural pastoral poet and writer, which can echo the poems and writings of Tao Yuanming of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. After reading Mr. Wang's poems, everyone praised him as a wise man. Recently, Zhonghua Book Company has sorted out all of his poems, lyrics, and manuscripts into the Plum Villa Collection, which is published in Song-style text, which will undoubtedly give people who love the quintessence of the country a beautiful spiritual food. The whole book is divided into three volumes. The first volume is the Apricot Rain Building Poetry Collection, in which the five-ancient and seven-ancient poems are very elegant, and the mind and spirit are no different from the rippling spring breeze and the horizontal autumn water.</p>
<p>"The meeting of minds is outside of things, the heart is willing to farm and fish, the crowns and carriages are not what is honored, and Ji Ying is in the same tone."</p>
<p>"Glory and profit are not in harmony with wishes, and the heart is willing to be indifferent, avoiding the world and obtaining nourishment, raising oneself to the clouds and cranes."</p>
<p>Looking at these poems, one is detached from the world, and the verses "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" of Tao Yuanming, can reflect each other in ancient and modern times. The second volume, the Pear Cloud Hall Lyrics Collection, has questions about Moon Pavilion and Yellow Crane Tower, which are magnificent and have the spirit of Xin Jiaxuan and Su Zizhan. The third volume is the Leisure Garden Text Archive, which are all works of visiting and writing scenery. Whether it is high mountains, wilderness, plank bridges, or flowing water, they are mostly included in small and short pieces, which can be compared with Liu Zihou's Yongzhou Eight Records. Among them, there are also impassioned poems and essays that are worried about the world and the times. Mr. Yang Zhongyu commented that it is Yue Wumu's White Hair Yin and Wen Wen Mountain's Righteous Qi Song, which is not a private word. Mr. Gu Yiqiao collected a lot of historical materials in the postscript of the Plum Villa Collection to introduce the author's life experience, with a source and a source, and everything is in order. As for the elegance of the writing and the thoroughness of the argumentation, it is like the family essays of Shi Han, which is even more Add to the reader's interest.</p>

<h3>Reading "Tess of the d'Urbervilles"</h3>
<p>— Peng Xingcai</p>
<p>Originally written by Thomas Hardy (England), translated by Lu Tianshi, published by Zhengfeng Publishing House</p>
<p>The British novelist Thomas Hardy is not an unfamiliar name to Chinese readers. Ten years ago, I read his "The Return of the Native" and "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" (i.e., "Tess of the d'Urbervilles"). I was captivated by the subtle and poetic descriptions, and I always felt an irreparable regret for Tess's unfortunate experiences!</p>
<p>Recently, I reopened Lu Tianshi's translation and managed to finish it amidst my busy schedule. When I closed the book and shut my eyes, the images and the tragic, bloody impressions constantly disturbed my peace. My heart felt inexplicably heavy, and I suppressed a sigh about to escape my lips, feeling that the author was unfair to Tess.</p>
<p>The author arranged for Tess a fate from which she could not escape. She struggled, she cried out! But she could not escape the tragic outcome, like Oedipus in a Greek tragedy. You may run, but the god of fate is waiting for you.</p>
<p>What crime did a pure and innocent child commit? Her "mistake" was not of her own making. Why should the sins of others be placed upon her? She possessed compassion and conscience, tenderness and passion. "She couldn't bear to hurt a fly or a small worm, and even shed tears for a bird in a cage." She was so unfortunate. She could endure Clare's abandonment, but she could not bear Alec's relentless temptation and pursuit. Clare was too harsh on her. Even a small lamb would get angry. She was hoarsely crying out for justice!</p>
<p>She could not bear the disappointment Clare caused her, nor could she bear to watch her widowed mother and younger siblings starve to death. Only then did she agree to cohabitate with Alec. If this can be called a weakness of her will, then Hardy had already said that she grew up in an environment of weak willpower. The author seemed to consider those erratic deeds as a natural development. Why should the inherited social predispositions, as well as the sins committed by her ancestors in armor during the reign of King Stephen, be repaid on her? Why did the tragedy of the D'Urberville family’s carriages have to replay on Tess?</p>
<p>According to the author's explanation, it seems that there is a certain fate in life, and naturally there is a master in the dark, which human beings cannot resist. After Tess was arrested, the author said, "Justice is revealed" and "the playfulness of the god of all things has also ceased."</p>
<p>The author is too pessimistic and believes in fate too much. Why not encourage readers to actively pursue "life"? Why insist on saying "I want to be" not born—earth on that side or elsewhere." "This living pain is serious."</p>
<p>If the author had not based Tess's unfortunate experiences on the control of fate, but rather on the problems of the social system, especially emphasizing that in the society at the time, a girl who made a mistake not of her own doing was not tolerated; the neighbors' spurning, the social exclusion, and the moral demands, if that were the case, then Tess's tragedy would be a social problem, not just Tess's personal problem, but the tragedy of more and more people in the world suffering the same misfortune as Tess.</p>
<p>In addition, in the depiction of characters and scenery, as well as the rigor of the structure and the meticulousness of the layout, it is unmatched by the novelists of the time. As the translator said in the preface, "Hardy's novel is like a complete organic object. Each part of the content, such as the layout, dialogue, characters, and scenery, is properly arranged, like a great building with balanced parts." This is indeed true. In the fatalism he created, for those impossible things and the stiff "coincidences," he had arranged a necessary reason in advance to make the development of the story more natural.</p>
<p>For example, when Tess was working at the farm, she went to Chaseborough alone one Saturday evening to have some fun (which was a trend at the time, and she had been there several times). She thought she could meet a companion on the street to accompany her back, but she happened to meet Alec. He volunteered to be her companion, but she refused, preferring to patiently wait for the crazed people to finish their dances before returning home together. Unfortunately, on the way, she had an argument with "Queen of Spades" because Tess said something hurtful to the crowd, and she was attacked by all of her companions. She was lonely and scolded, ridiculed, and teased. At this moment, Alec arrived on horseback and said, "Jump on! Sit behind me, and we can leave this group of screaming women immediately."</p>
<p>She felt a great sense of immediate danger. If it had been at another time, she would have definitely rejected him. But just at this moment of crisis, he invited her onto the horse, and with a simple movement, she could eliminate her fear and hatred of these enemies. So, she jumped onto the saddle without hesitation. By the time those combative, lecherous people realized it, they had already ridden far into the gray mist.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, her loss of virtue seemed inevitable, not at all forced. An impossible thing was arranged very reasonably in Hardy's pen.</p>
<p>The scenery described by Hardy has the same value as the characters he portrays. The scenery in "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" is not only a decorative background but also a backdrop for a tragic or joyful atmosphere. Flowers, trees, wind, rain, and dusk all have their own characteristics, and these characteristics can affect the changes in the characters' psychology. "On that starry night, a great wind suddenly rose, and Tess felt that this wind was the sigh of an extremely tragic person."</p>
<p>When Tess narrated the story of her loss of virtue, "Everything in the room seemed to change color for her, the ashes in the grate showed a sinister and very strange look, as if they didn't care about her difficulties at all, the damper leisurely put on a cold smile, as if it didn't care about her predicament, the water bottle was busy flashing, and the surrounding objects repeatedly declared that they had no responsibility, but since he kissed her, nothing had changed, it could even be said that the essence of everything had not changed, but the spirit of these things had changed."</p>
<p>Clare, after listening to her story, did not forgive her because of her soft and plaintive voice. He considered her a vulgar woman lacking spirituality and prepared to separate from her immediately. At this time, Hardy wrote: "He quietly walked out of the room. The two glasses of wine he poured while eating—one for Tess and one for himself—were still on the table untouched. This was the result of their 'love' meal; only two or three hours earlier, they had shared a cup of tea due to a moment of impulse."</p>
<p>Tess's happiness vanished with her story. Two hours earlier, Tess was still immersed in a sweet dream. Who knew that after two o'clock, everything seemed to be buried in the flowing water? These two glasses of wine were a powerful irony, with sarcasm and sympathy, allowing the reader to deeply appreciate Tess's pitiful situation.</p>
<p>In fact, in "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," we can see that the author's pessimistic thoughts are not due to hatred of people or being greatly stimulated and disappointed. He has sympathy for everything he describes in the universe. He loves birds and beasts, he loves injured pheasants, and even more so, he loves all of humanity. In his pen, they are all pitiful and worthy of sympathy characters: John Durbeyfield, Angel Clare, Marian, Tess, Liza-Lu, and even Alec. Hardy sympathizes with them and nurtures them with tears.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Pattern Drawings</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>A certain cosmetics company published the following advertisement in major newspapers:</p>
<p>"Our company has been selling a type of face cream for many years with a great reputation. Now, to promote business and improve decoration, we are offering a reward of 20 million yuan to solicit trademarks. The characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lasting fragrance</p>
<p>(2) Does not harm the skin</p>
<p>(3) …………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Any patterns with artistic flair, eye-catching appeal, and helpful in promoting business are welcome to enter. Deadline is × month × day. After the deadline, experts will be hired to determine the rankings. The first place winner will receive 10 million yuan in national currency, the second place winners (2 winners) will receive 3 million yuan each, the third place winners (5 winners) will receive 1 million yuan each, and the fourth place winners (50 winners) will receive one dozen of our company's ×× face cream each……".</p>
<p>On the day of the deadline, thanks to the reputation of the company's brand and the wide sales of the face cream, there were indeed many applicants. A total of 2,993 entries were received. After the deadline, the judging naturally took place.</p>
<p>In the general manager's office, the general manager, the advertising department director, the designer, and the attendant standing aside formed a judging committee.</p>
<p>The advertising director tore open the letters one by one and took out the manuscripts inside.</p>
<p>The first piece was a woman composed of soft lines, wearing a veil over her head and body, holding a ball of flowers, with some curved artistic characters next to her, somewhat like those used on neon lights.</p>
<p>"Not good, not good," said the general manager.</p>
<p>The second piece was an oval face, half painted white and half still dark, with curly hair and a soft face without a single crease. A terribly long and thin hand was applying face cream on the face. The picture had two large red characters, square and hard.</p>
<p>"Even worse!"</p>
<p>The third piece was just a few small flowers, with branches and leaves forming a picture frame, and several "artistic" characters that no one could recognize, with an illegible signature like crab writing below.</p>
<p>"No stimulation, no stimulation." The general manager took a hard puff of his cigar, and the fragrant smoke he exhaled formed a cloud over many of the entry letters. The designer, however, stared at the three patterns. The tea server stared blankly with his mouth open.</p>
<p>The fourth piece was a red V in the middle, two golden characters, and many Roman-style crab writings next to it.</p>
<p>"Cliché!"</p>
<p>The fifth piece had a scarlet mouth……</p>
<p>"Somewhat interesting."</p>
<p>The sixth piece was just a slender hand holding a bottle of face cream……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>A yellow-bottomed pattern was pulled out, depicting a woman emerging from the bath, with long curly hair draped over her body, and only a narrow strip of cloth around her waist. "Interesting, interesting," the general manager hurriedly grabbed it, slowly took a puff of his cigar, and the smoke floated lightly from his nostrils. His fat head swayed, and the wrinkles on the back of his neck became deeper.</p>
<p>"Not a single word is bad, but it's a bit too stiff. The words in the last flower picture are not bad, haha… This woman is drawn pretty well, look at the two breasts, this pose is simply excellent! The others simply don't understand art, and have no advertising value at all. This one is good, this one is good!"</p>
<p>"Let's change a few words on it," said the advertising director.</p>
<p>"No need to look at the others," said the general manager.</p>
<p>A few days later, a notice from a certain cosmetics company appeared in the newspaper again.</p>
<p>"...The solicitation of trademark patterns has been judged and is now announced as follows:</p>
<p>"First..."</p>
<p>The trademark of ×× Cream has been changed, but no one has claimed the prizes. The company itself has gained a huge profit, and the general manager has become even fatter. (February 13, copied)</p>
<h3>Arts and Culture Scene</h3>
<p>— Yu Chang</p>
<p>The songs performed by the acting troupe at the public performance were very well received, especially the composer Shu Mo himself, who took to the stage to sing his masterpiece "Wang Xiaoer Spends the New Year" accompanied by gongs and drums. The lyrics were colloquial and the flavor was rich.</p>
<p>Hong Mo was in great distress because of Yingzi's serious illness and cried bitterly backstage at "Guanghua" a few days ago.</p>
<p>There are rumors that Lan Ma will go to Hong Kong to collaborate with Jiang Junchao on a film.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, Wang Ping returned home from filming "Paradise Dream" at the Second China Film Studio. While the car was crossing the Waibaidu Bridge, the driver fell asleep in the car, causing the car to crash into a power pole. Wang Ping suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan will return to Shanghai soon to make a film for "Cathay."</p>
<p>"Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," directed by Shi Dongshan of "Lianhua," is scheduled to be screened simultaneously at the "Empress," "Huguang," and "Carlton" theaters starting on the 21st.</p>
<p>More than 100 people from the film and theater industry attended the drama festival's Municipal Drama School's party. The school's students performed the comic opera "Wang Da Niang Mends the Pot" during the entertainment program, which was extremely wonderful.</p>
<p>At the Drama School party, Hong Shen, after being enthusiastically requested by the guests, took to the stage to perform a section of Peking Opera, singing a young male role in a high-pitched voice. Hong was still in high spirits, and the audience below the stage was already in fits of laughter.</p>
<p>Kaixuan Film Company recently plans to film a movie at the Second China Film Studio, and the director has been set as Ma Xuwibang.</p>
<p>Ling Wang Mei Guanfang, who currently resides at No. 121 Sinan Road (i.e., Massenet Road), is rumored to be moving. The person moving in is He Jian, the former chairman of Hunan Province.</p>
<p>More than a month has passed since Li Shifang's tragic death in a plane crash on January 5th. It is confirmed that the theater circles in Shanghai are planning to launch a charity performance to express their condolences to Li's family. The charity performance program includes "Two Entering the Palace" by Mei's sons Baojiu and Baoyue.</p>
<h3>Mark Twain</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>Once, the humorous master Mark Twain visited the studio of the great painter Whistler and carefully admired the paintings. Later, he wanted to touch a canvas with his hand. "Hey," Whistler said loudly, "Don't touch! It's not dry yet!"</p>
<p>"It's okay," Mark Twain replied, "I'm wearing gloves."</p>
<h3>The Moon Shakes the Layers of Mountains: 100,000 Tons of Garbage Accumulated in Shanghai, Not Yet Cleared.</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>The painting is wonderful and full of "Ash Heap", the objects are numerous and the strange smells hit the sky! Little Sanzi sings "Xiaochongshan", in the layers of mountains, crowded with living gods.</p>
<p>Nonsense about health environment, no mention of sexuality; 100,000 tons accumulated over the years, let it go, donate money for cleaning.</p>
<p>Note: "Ash Heap" is a type of painting in Chinese painting, collecting and depicting various broken and old miscellaneous objects. "Xiaochongshan" is the name of a Ci poetic meter. The original meter is a combination of "Xijiangyue" and "Xiaochongshan".</p>
<h3>A Collection of Storms</h3>
<p>— Li Shui</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau has approved the unauthorized price increase of Shanghai cinemas, which is exceptional. Although cinemas can be allowed to increase prices, the Social Affairs Bureau should impose severe penalties on cinemas for disregarding the law and taking action without approval.</p>
<p>American goods are soaring, and joint commercial venues are not only experiencing sluggish business but also have scarce inventory. Insiders say that American goods have increased by an average of three to four times.</p>
<p>The income of a salaried class will never suddenly increase by three or four times. It is only natural that there will be no market for American goods from now on.</p>
<p>The method of rationing physical goods should extend to cultural figures and journalists. Their lives are no better than those of public educators!</p>
<p>Cultural figures and journalists should object to the authorities' measures.</p>
<p>After Shanghai entered wartime control, one must also be careful of the "Black Whirlwind". The activity of various goods-smuggling gangs in the past two days shows that the "Black Whirlwind" has swept Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Department Store Owner Said: What's Sold Can't Be Restocked - They're All Watching for Price Hikes!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wen</p>
<p>The department store in the alley was tidying up the storefront, one clerk was wiping the glass, and another was changing the price tags.</p>
<p>I decided to go inside. I was familiar with the big boss, he was calculating accounts, sucking on his pen, and using his abacus.</p>
<p>"Is it time to close up shop?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Almost, the weather is cold and business is slow, so it's better to close up early." He greeted me with a smile, took out a Great Britain brand cigarette from the drawer to offer me. I often come here to chat, and the boss is very talkative.</p>
<p>The topic started with rice prices.</p>
<p>"You shopkeepers are better off than us, what are you afraid of if the tide rises?" I said.</p>
<p>"Hey, brother! You can't say that. We'd rather do more business and earn less profit. The cost of living is high, and those of us who run shops also have to eat. How can we not be affected?"</p>
<p>"That's just the usual talk from you businessmen, trying to defend yourselves!"</p>
<p>He got anxious and shouted, "Then take a look at our business these past few days!"</p>
<p>Business was indeed very slow. Besides me, there wasn't a single customer, and I was just here to chat, not intending to "patronize" anything. The fluorescent light was shivering from the cold, making the three-bay storefront look even more miserable. Looking at the employees' faces, the yellowish skin was shrouded in a layer of melancholy. Looking at them made me want to cry. They wouldn't be happy about the price increases, would they? They still have to smile when customers come, otherwise the boss will scold them: "You're fed, why do you still have to look so gloomy all day?"</p>
<p>I remember before welcoming the God of Wealth this year, my colleague Xiao Zhang was worried about being laid off and even came to me to test the waters. Later, he wasn't the one who was laid off, so he was relieved. How long has it been, and he's standing by the counter again, worried that the money he sends home isn't enough. The boss is muttering behind his back, "People are never satisfied."</p>
<p>To dilute the atmosphere, I changed the topic and casually asked about the prices of some daily necessities.</p>
<p>The boss excitedly told me that a pair of ordinary socks that you could wear now cost more than 7,000 yuan. At the end of last year, they only cost more than 3,000 yuan. Woolen undershirts and the like have limited price increases. At the end of last year, they cost 7,000 yuan, but now they're only 9,000.</p>
<p>"What has the most dramatic increase?"</p>
<p>"Like thermos bottles, last year they were only 16,000, but now they cost as much as 32,000 yuan, and there's not much money to be made. The most dramatic increase is soap. Last year, you could buy it for 800 yuan, but now it's risen to 2,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"You can make a fortune with this inventory of yours."</p>
<p>"Hey, what's sold can't be restocked, brother."</p>
<p>"Then keep it and don't sell it."</p>
<p>"What will we use to feed the employees?"</p>
<p>"Borrow money!"</p>
<p>"High-interest loans are unbearable."</p>
<p>The topic came back again, and I quickly avoided it and asked him the price of toothpaste and handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>"Handkerchiefs have increased fairly well, from 2,000 to 3,000. Samsung toothpaste sold for 800 yuan last year, and now it's two yuan. If you want to buy some, I'll give you a cheaper price."</p>
<p>"I don't want to buy any, I want to see the prices drop." I joked.</p>
<p>He smiled, "In the past, we looked forward to daybreak for a better life. Now, it seems like we don't know when the prices will drop."</p>
<p>I felt a little embarrassed and asked him how much business he had done today.</p>
<p>"Only 400,000 or 500,000. Have you seen many customers come in since you've been here?"</p>
<p>I thought about it, only two or three people, some of them just looked and left.</p>
<p>I also wanted to leave.</p>
<p>The boss politely said, "Anyway, there's no business, come and chat when you're free."</p>
<h3>Goodbye! Cost of Living Index!</h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>Every month, we employees who rely on the cost of living index stretch our necks and wait for the "good news" of the index.</p>
<p>Now, thank goodness, "life" no longer has an "index." We no longer need to care about the "index." We not only approve of this policy but also praise this virtuous act because we do not hope to have any cost of living index. The index represents prices. A high cost of living index means that prices continue to climb, right? Although we also hope for a high index, we do not hope for prices to rise! In other words, do we really hope for high prices? No, absolutely not! We are forced by high prices, and we have no choice but to hope for an "increase in the index" to compensate for life. Now that the "index" is "frozen" from now on, we believe that "prices" will also be "frozen" from now on, and will gradually decrease as a result. In this way, we common people can rest easy and have no worries in the future.</p>
<p>But, what if prices do not fall with the frozen index, but instead increase several times? We will always calculate our salaries based on the January index. How will we survive?</p>
<p>These past two days, besides the fall in the official exchange rate of gold and US dollars at the Central Bank, other things are still jumping blindly upwards. Of course, this may be a temporary state. In a few days, it will definitely get better. We will only suffer for a few days. We have been able to endure for eight years, so what does it matter to us for these few days?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say: Goodbye! Cost of living index, we no longer need you from now on.</p>

<h3>"Far Away Love"</h3>
<p>— Wen Shu</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the working technology of Chinese films is low and impoverished. We strive for "exquisite" to the greatest extent possible with limited financial and material resources, but it is still rare. In order to save money, the bosses welcome some "artisan-type" directors when releasing films, who cater to their preferences and handle things casually. As a result, "moving comic strip pictures" are mass-produced and fill the market. "Far Away Love" took more than half a year to produce. Judging from the entire film, it has indeed undergone some deliberation and polishing. It has set a good example and is worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>The director's strengths are his meticulousness and caution, but he loses out to triviality. The editing of the material could also be more concise. Controlling the development of the entire play appears to be insufficient in the second half. In technical terms, it "lacks power". After Yu Zhen and Professor Xiao parted ways in Wuhan, the ensemble concentrated its efforts on expressing the working scene of Yu Zhen's other side, the "broad love". The more concrete development of the central event with Xiao Yu as the main engine was neglected, and a few short meetings were not enough.</p>
<p>As for the actors, I don't think Zhao Dan is satisfying. His "acting" is just "acting". There is a need for discussion on the character modeling, especially in the first part. Why decorate a university professor with some superficial things? Those American-style small movements are not something a scholar should have. I think it would be better if Zhao Dan "objectively denied his role". Tai Yi has achieved great success, not as rigid as before, but not pretentious either. She is simple and real, and her performance makes a clear contrast to Zhao Dan. Wu Yin's role is like the main seasoning in a dish. The progress of the story relies heavily on her, and she has indeed fulfilled this responsibility, but in expressing the identity of the elder sister, she seems to be able to be more subtle – I mean the acting method. Those hmm-hmm-ahh-ahh sounds and the old-fashioned expressions on her face are really not endearing. Tang Yuanzhi's role is somewhat nondescript, whether it is the director's handling or his own design, especially his laughter, which makes the audience feel terrified when it appears in such a scene.</p>
<p>These are all more demanding requirements. The director, workers, and actors have completed such an exquisite work under such poor material conditions, which can be called a valuable harvest for Chinese films. Those are just flaws in the jade.</p>
