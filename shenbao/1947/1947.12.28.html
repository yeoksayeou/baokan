<h3>美將澄清對日政策　明正國會中可能有所決定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕一年將終，華府預測美國對日政策可能發生統盤改變，最近倫敦四國外長會議失敗即其主要原因。國會議員認爲蘇聯拒絕在歐洲方面與英法美三國合作，已供給美國嚴新檢討太平洋政策之基礎。本年美國人民心目中主要對日間題，厥在何時與日本簽訂和約，政府內外多數人士均信爲時已近，一月間國會復會，日本問題必將較前更受注意。據多數議員聲稱，美國對日佔領政策亦將再經國會審査，議員與商界現正加　指摘日本境內實施之經濟與社會改革，實反對英美利益，且與民主原則不合。同時，美國輿論亦一致擁　國會力謀澄淸日本問題。</p>
<h3>華府郵報强調　美國援華數字</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕據華盛頓郵報本日載稱，自日本投降以後美國援華數額已達十三億九千八百萬美元。郵報本日發表美國對華財政援助之統計數字，並遵循國務院之一般意見，强調所謂對中國「極爲龐大」之經濟援助，以答復批評美國漠視蔣主席之人士。該報　表之數額，係根據「新官方數字」，較十月間總統經濟顧問委會所發表者多七萬元，國務院現正應參院撥款委會最近辯論時所提出之請求就臨時對華援助之資料詳予　訂。在此工作完成前，國務院對郵報之消息不予評論，郵報素竭力主張援歐。頃稱上述數字包括聯總計劃下國對華之援助，但未能說明日本投降後美國援華之「全部事實」。該報繼稱，徒有數字，不足說明美國如何爲蔣主席裝備卅九個師，並在靑島進行訓練中國海軍之偉大計劃。該報爲强調美國對華之大批援助，復稱美國海軍船隻二百七十一艘，現亦已移交中國，唯郵報並未指出一九四五年七月一日至一九四七年六月卅日之間，美國對華援助款及物資信用貸款僅佔總額百分之二點五，英國則佔百分之四十入點六，法國佔百分之二十點九，郵報所載對軍之援助，包括日本投降後至一九四七年六月三十日軍事租借項下七億二千八百萬元，民用租借項下，油管信用貸款四千九百萬元，進出口銀行批准之信用貸款八千三百萬元，聯總救濟計劃項下美國對華援助四億六千八百萬元，購買剩餘物資之信用貸款四千萬元，以及聯總結束後之救濟費用三千萬元，合計爲十三億九千八百萬元，然國外剩餘物資淸管委會之官員，對上述剩餘物資信用貨放四千萬元無法加以證實。</p>

<h3>從重點教育說到絲織教育</h3>
<p>— 王夢凡</p>
<p>中國當前　　的重點，雖不在紡織工業，但是全國四億五千萬人民的「衣」，不能不　紡織工業的從給；所以發展紡織工業，在建國的過程中，實在也是刻不容緩的事；何況我國紡織工業向　落後，尤應急起憤追。但是發展紡織工業的要國　，不在紡織機器的增添，原料棉花的　　，而在紡織人才的培養。南通學院是國內唯一的紡織學校，在此「爭取學術獨立」「重點教育」的議論紛紜之際，　們對於紡織教育的辦理方針，似乎也有加以討論的價值。</p>
<p>南通學院辦在江蘇南通，其所代表的區域，是江淮三角洲的濱海區，而濱海區最大的需要，是墾殖，墾殖主要作物是棉花，過去南通學院對於棉作研究有極長的歷史，有很大的貢獻，今後更可把握住這一點，從事充實。舉凡與棉作有關係的各種研究設備，都可自成體系，加以培植，使國內及世界上與這一區域同一自然條件的地帶，都以南通學院棉作研究爲參考借鏡。但是棉作一科，除其本身應有之研究外，舉凡昆虫，土壤，肥料，氣象，農具，棉產以及有關墾殖之測量，水利，農村合作，農場管理等等，均有密切關係，僅以此，即足以成爲院。</p>
<p>至於紡織。是棉作的延續工作，南通學院是國內第一個紡織學校，在中國紡織教育史上具有光榮的記錄。張季真先生創辦地方事業所倡導的棉　政策，也就在把棉墾與紡織予以聯系。但是南通學院欲以紡織爲其重點教育，則應注意下列幾個問題：</p>
<p>增加紗錠與織機台數問題；　最大多數手紡與家庭紡織曁機器紡織的改進問題；　紡織機械的自給問題；　全國棉產區與棉紡織之配合曁國民經濟之發展問題；　紡織品市場問題。這些問題關係到各種應用科學，自然科學與社會科學，假若都成爲體系，予以充實，自可成為一所單獨大學而有餘。</p>
<p>但是也有人說：要爭取獨立的學術領域，不能割裂得太細碎，把一個部門中間抽出一個枝節（如棉墾）或應用部門中的提出一小類（如紡織），作爲爭取學術獨立的一個基地。這見地雖然也似有理由，但是我們要注意到從爭取學術獨立要達到國家獨立的目的，在緩慢的學術研究中，一定也要注意到迎頭趕上的迅速條件，在這「現實的」「速效的」要求下，把學術領域中單一的應用的小範疇，專提出來做成中心，應當有其需要。所以我們想要需要棉墾紡織的江淮濱海區爲對象，以南通學院爲棉墾紡織之研究實驗推廣的重心，進而爲全國與世界棉作紡織中心之一。</p>
<p>要想把這一遺景完全實現，當然需要設備與人才。關於設備；應當由政府方面學校本身及社會方面分頭集中力量，從事充實。這種爲國家爭取學術獨立的基地，他應當代表整個國家，政府應毫無公立私立分別，隨時以全力扶持，盡量把世界上有關的重要設備，加以蒐購，全部置於一點，使之充實。在校內，雖然各科系　是繼續　理，但是在充實設備上，應以與棉　紡織有關者爲優先。這一時期至少訂爲五年或十年，俟大體上充實具備足爲第一流條件後，再訂次一步驟的計劃。關於人才：包括世界第一流對於棉與紡織等具有研究的學者。棉墾紡織企業家，研究棉墾紡織具有心得的專家，受基本訓練有志進修的研究人員，以及担任基本訓練的教員。這些人才都要以棉墾紡織的研究實驗推廣爲終身職業，其待遇必須提高，如此一定能夠吸引國內外的專門人才。</p>
<p>要之，從重點教育說到棉墾及紡織教育，南通學院的重點，不僅要增設院系完成大學，而且要錄求重點，以建立學術中心。雖然跛行辦法，對於棉墾紡織以外的科系，恐怕要被認爲不平；不過在南通學院過去及現有的各科系，多少都與棉墾紡織有些關聯，就是醫科，在創校校長張季真先生創立初意，也是應農墾工業發達後的本區域之自然需要，也還是與墾植紡織相配合發展的。所以南通學院的改設大學運動，從這一個角度去觀察，是應得政府及社會的贊助的。</p>

<p>總統府組織草案</p>
<p>（上接一版）王俊主張總辦公廳主任形同副總統，實不應設置。至是孫兼院長謂，去年國大對　法第四章總統之地位職權，曾詳加討論，有主　美制者，有主　法制者，美國總統等於國家元首，同時又爲政府首長，實有兩重資格，白宮組織於二次大戰後雖漸複雜，但內容仍單純，僅設秘書。羅斯福總統設海陸軍參謀總長，並無參軍處，文官處只一副官長隨從。法國總統等於國家元首，僅發佈命令而不執行。根據我國憲法第四章第三十五至四十四條之規定，總統完全爲國家元首，等於資任內閣之總統，而政府首長乃係行政院長，管理政務者爲行政院，　軍事者爲國防部，總統並不直接發佈命令，而須通過政府經常機構。由此以觀，總統辦公處之體制應求簡單，較美國尤應簡單。孫院長又指出，美國統下所設秘書並非部長，我國對美國國務秘書Secretary　Of　State一詞，相沿譯作「國務卿」，乃封建思想，實　錯　。美國國務秘書之任務有二：　中央政府與各邦之聯　，　美國對外之交涉，近因各邦聯　均已建立，乃專黨對外交涉。孫院長主張，我國總統府組織不應直接管理政事，否則變成兩個政府，權限不　，必致發生府院之爭，一切大小政務，皆歸行政院。且總統府　參政顧問，未免有參政干政之嫌，原草案實欠考慮。該案交憲法法規委會重行審查，亦不必以之爲藍本，希望一月底或二月初監理完畢，　交下次大會討論。</p>

<h3>英外交政策重檢討貝文擬就草案提交閣議</h3>
<p>遏阻蘇聯勢力英美有增强合作必要</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕英國或將於下星期採取初期切實步驟，放棄戰後世界調解人之任務，而與美國合夥阻止蘇聯。英內閣定下週一舉行全體會議，討論英國外交政策之臨時草案，此乃貝文外相於倫敦四外長會議破後所擬。政府人員對於此項閣議決定之重要性不欲輕視，私下表示此種決議不僅包括有關德國之政策問題，且有關蘇聯與西方國家經濟與思想衝突之各區域。蘇外長莫洛托夫對英國推行帝國主義政策之指責，雖感痛心瘁首，但聞貝文不願實行攤牌，以免無限期終止四强磋商。四外長會議前，英外部發言人一再重申東西爭執可由妥協解決之信念，甚至在會議結束後，貝文猶不願參加馬歇爾制止蘇聯搬走德工廠之計劃。自是以還，若干因素已使局勢改觀，此種因素有助於貝文之決策，及內閣擴大對美政策之支持，主要因素殆為杜魯門總統向國會提出之援歐計劃，另一因素則為蘇聯在國希臘及中東加緊反美運動引起英國之憤怒，其他因素為希臘共黨政府之成立，或可獲得蘇聯勢力下各國之公開支援。</p>
<p>貝文向內閣提出之備忘錄，內容嚴守秘密，但大致不外：（一）設法邀請法國參加西德英美經濟合作；（二）西方佔領區政治管制擴大可能引起之危機；（三）採取各項步驟，經由同盟條約增加英國在阿拉伯各國間之地位。（四）對日和約一旦草成時英國及聯邦之目標。</p>
<h3>前國務卿威爾斯著文縱綸美對蘇政策</h3>
<p>對世界問題犯七大錯誤</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿七日廣播：美前國務卿威爾斯著文申論美國之盼來人，聲稱，蘇聯已決定採取擴張之侵略政策，苟放任蘇聯控制歐洲近東與遠東，則美國人民之安全，即將遭遇威脅。渠指出美國在戰後世界政治中曾犯七大「錯誤」：（一）美國未能阻止中國之內戰，目前此項內戰正在破壞中國，最後並有引起美國蘇因遠東利益而發生衝突之可能；（二）在勝利之前，美國未能勸使盟國約締造和平問題獲致協議，尤以對德問題為最；（三）未能利用租借案及軍事上之優勢，使盟國恪守大西洋憲章；（四）在歐洲勝利之前，未能就戰後經濟復興計劃商得同意；（五）對西半球其他國家施用政治及經濟壓力；（六）未能就德國問題與法國進行協商；（七）未能及時認識民主義大利對美國人民之極大重要性。</p>
<h3>史汀生撰傳記讚譽蔣主席</h3>
<p>對世界風雲人物均加評語</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日合眾電〕史汀生所作之人物傳記中，對第二次大戰中之風雲人物，作如下評論：蔣主席一心謀求中國之統一，一心以中國之救主自任；史達林為一不可欺之人物；戴高樂驕矜自持，性燥易怒，雖不易共事。賴伐爾則無異吉士林；貝當因一時之良好戰士，終為老朽；史迪威乃美國最偉大之戰士，其中印緬戰區之任務，勝過美國所有軍界人物。史汀生認為攻克密支那乃一偉大之戰時，而未為人充分注意，至馬歇爾則為渠一生中所僅見之最佳戰士。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統二十六日發表命令委任國務卿馬晚歇爾監督五億二千二百萬元緊急援助法·義·奧計劃之執行。按美國會亦已批准一千八百萬元之援華案，然該計劃之細節尚未擬就，且以數目並不包括於杜魯門授權國務院執行之範圍之內。杜魯門之命令授權馬晚歇爾在執行援外法案時可以總統名義執行任務，且可有權指令其他政府機構參加協助。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿六日電〕代理國務卿羅維特稱：美國緊急援歐基金五萬四千萬美元中，現正在計劃立即預支一億五千萬元，並正在擬具將中國列入長期世界經濟復興之救濟議案下，對中國另行撥付之救濟基金，將在聯總結束協定之條件下與對歐洲同樣施行，因新撥款已經表閃為同樣之目標，即救濟而非長期復興也。</p>

<h3>冬令救濟統籌辦理　眞假難民問題嚴重應予注意　吳巿長擧行茶會招待新聞界　提出三項問題徵詢意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲冬令救濟事宜，於昨日下午五時，在市府會議室邀請本市新聞界負責人舉行談話會。出席潘公展·何西亞·趙君豪·趙敏恒·羅敦偉·王芸生·湯增　·胡傳厚·程王西·方志超等二十餘人。首由市長報吿救濟事宜之推進情形，略稱：據市府調查結果，本　難民總數約爲三十萬人，衣食住行實際亟需救濟渚，約爲五萬人。冬令救濟捐款發動後，蒙各界熱烈響應，成績圓滿，總數六百億已達目標。惟在勸募捐款及難民之收容處理方面，發生三項問題，擬請新聞界人士協助指示：　募款問題：冬令救濟勸募展開後，各界激於正義　及同情心，踴躍捐輸，成續頗可觀。惟市政當局以捐款之處理，無統籌之機構，亦無統籌之分發辦法，恐難免發生流弊，此點擬請愼重商討。　難民之處理問題：據市府分析難民之來源，本市難民可分爲三類：一係來自蘇北及安徽等戰區者，二爲上海固有之遊民乞丐，三乃黃牛黨·扒手·小偷之流。市府方面，擬將難民中之身强力壯者，施予以工代賑辦法，令其疏濬河道，每日撥給工資二三萬元，俟冬令過後，即可　得歸鄉川資，或可作小本經營之資本。至於難民中之老弱婦孺，則築就收容所予以收養。而最難處理者，厥爲黃牛黨·乞丐·小偷之流，因渠等如不加收留，則與社禽治安有直接影響，如施以工賑，則恐良善者受其同化。現照市府之本意，擬將彼等收容至習藝所中，與難民隔離。　關於收容技術之改進問題；據市府調查結果，發現難民之中，有一部份係屬假冒。彼等擅自侵入各寄柩所，且不時聚衆至各處請求救濟。當局擬將其移入收容所，竟遭拒絕。渠等之理由爲「進入收容所後，雖得溫暖，惟失自由。」此種情形之產生，極爲嚴車，望各界加以重視。並盼新聞界方面能提供意見，俾　改進，可成爲今後救濟工作之示範。</p>
<h3>報人發表意見</h3>
<p>市長詞畢，王芸生·羅敦偉·方志超等即相繼發表意見，大致認為目今巿民對救濟難民情緖熱烈，當局切不可擅加抑挫。至於捐款統籌辦法，雖屬可行，性效果亟應加强。「救濟如救火」，不宜因公事手續而延誤。</p>
<p>最後由吳市長將會中之意見，歸納如下：　冬令救濟捐款，決由冬令救濟委員會統籌辦理。凡新設捐款機構之負責人，應即向市商會三樓冬令救濟委員會接洽，領取正式收據薄，然後再向外界勸募。凡市民中之執有捐款收據者，即免捐第二次。　關於勸募寒衣事宜，亦應先向冬令救濟會接合，由該會商請各區保甲方面指定區域，分發寒衣，以免偏枯重複之弊。　難民處理方面，擬請本市各敎會廟宇等慈善機構推派人負協助管理，並盼各報能經常派請記者，視察各收容所，並儘量供獻意見，傳責改進。</p>
<h3>民食調配會　決改組擴大　配米限於指數計薪職工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市民食調配委員會，於昨晨十時，召開第九次會議，由吳主任委，縮小範圍，核定工人福利委員會等十八戶。　修改職業工人配米辦法，除原規定辦法外，另加「配米對象，限於依照生活指數計薪之職工，並領有國民身份證者」一項。　十二月份配米，月底截止申請。本年度各項配米事務於下年一月十五日前全部結束。　第二期計口授油價格定二十九日召開議價會商討決定。第一期計口授油本有大小口之分，大口一斤，小口半斤，但各區無大小口之調查。故在戶籍主管機關未有大小口精確統計前，自第二期起，每月每口一律配售十二兩，不分大小，該項辦法待報市府准後施行。　通過核准冬令救濟委員會配米五千石。</p>
<h3>由各機關·會同參加</h3>
<p>據該會吳主任委員吿記者稱：民食調配會現今之組織不够健全，一切問題無從談起。米由糧食部職掌，煤由燃管會管理，油歸中信局負責，而調配會之重要職員皆由社會局調派兼任，以致兩面工作皆受影響。明年度工作將着眼於全面配售，此舉有關全市五百萬市民，故非充實機構不可。渠已決定　此兼職，日前經濟會報及本次調配會例會均通過改組民食調配會，呈請中央派員負責主持。由中央銀行，糧食部，經濟部，燃管會，中信局，市商會，總工會，巿參議會，市政府，警察局等單位參加。</p>

<h3>影院自動漲價　吳開先談　尙在考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨稱：电影票漲價事尙在　盧，外傳元旦起實行恐不可能，蓋手續尙未完備故也。至於影院業決定「自動調整」票價說，頗有涸題，財政局須待接獲社會局核准漲懺通知後，方於電影票上加蓋娛樂稅印章。社會局欲査影院賬目，並非指其逃稅或營私舞弊，蓋影院所呈漲價理由為開支不敷，社會局欲明瞭者，即其是否確實耳。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之越劇女伶筱丹桂服來沙而自殺一案，國泰越劇院經理張春帆被控敎咬自殺，經地檢處檢察官提起公訴後，由地院梅爾和推事兩度審理，業已終結，昨晨宣判，梅爾和推事升座刑八庭後，即將張春帆提出，張着麥爾登呢長袍，鴨舌頭毡鞋，訊明年籍後，梅推事即起立宣讀判決書主文：「張春帆無罪」。判畢即宣示理由，當時張聆判後，面露笑容，深深一鞠躬，以示謝意。張之律師要求准予交保，庭上准許，飭張交二家舖保，保證金額爲國幣三萬萬元，遂退庭。張於昨日下午覓得洪昌·日昇兩綢廠舖保，保釋出獄。其宣判無罪之判決理由略謂：　起訴警所載錢春韻生前與被吿口角時，曾有「如身體不淸可以死」一語，作爲被吿預知自殺之根據，訊之被吿固稱，未曾聞及，縱令屬實，亦無非爲錢氏於爭吵時負氣之語，且距自殺之時，有數日之久，要難以此斷定被吿激促其自殺之憑證。　錢氏之自殺，出於猝然，初非被告所能料及。被吿旣未能預見其結果之發生，自屬無從防範，故不應負刑法第十五條第二百七十五條第一項之罪責，殊爲顯然。　然則錢氏之自殺，究屬何因，綜核全案情節，不難辨明，錢自此事件發生後，屢向被吿表示悔恨，甚望能重溫舊好，以彌補彼此間情感上所生之裂痕，已非一日。惟被吿冷寞視之，憂鬱之情，数日以來，仍未釋懷。又錢氏屢擬偕赴杭州，藉遣愁緒，第因事阻，未能成行，及至同月十三日錢氏梳妝已畢，即將啓程之前，又爲被吿拒絕，因萌厭世之念。被吿責人過苛，則對已故之錢氏於情義上固有可議之處，然經查並無敎唆自殺之確據，依法應予諭知無罪。據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第二百九十三條第一項判決如主文。</p>

<h3>硬辦法失效　軟工夫實現　港督秘密抵穗　為拆屋事件尋覓「打圓塲」方式</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿四日航訊〕九龍城事件廣州興論屢作嚴正表示，力促港府尊重我國主權，不可乘我國內患外憂交迫之際，再爲中英邦交增添不愉快的一頁。港府最近似亦深明大義，經兩廣外交特派員郭德華自京携回新訓令，和港府一再談判後，港府態度似已開始轉變。日前香港中西報紙，俱大字刋出一個消息，說港督葛量洪爵士作週末旅行，但目的地不能宣佈，正在香港方面紛紛推測之中，港督却靜悄悄地跑到廣州來，和宋主任密商九龍城事件的解決辦法。這個消息是記者從可靠方面打聽得來，十分可靠。但港督爲什麼要作「不可吿人」的出遊？據熱悉香港英人作風的有資格方面說：英國紳士，做錯了事，硬不認錯，祇好推三搪四，借故打圓塲。這回，九龍裁判署像煞有介事的發傳票召審九能城內居民。到了開審那天，居民沒有一個到堂，（因爲他們並不受治於英國法律），那個法官大概一時氣昏了，竟頒下「拆屋令」。港府那有權力去拆中華民國土地上的民房？但法令是不能反覆的，而九龍城的老百姓也不會拱手讓別人去拆倒他們的房子，何况這是一個外交問題，與九龍裁判署的民法「風爲牛不相及！」但港府所以貿然出此，不外一個「嚇」字，假如老百姓給他聲色俱厲的嚇倒，大家跑去甘受英國法律的裁決，那事情便好辦得多了。現在，硬的工夫用過無效，祇好改用軟工夫，港督便不辭勞瘁跑來廣州見宋主任，商談一個「圓場」的辦法，讓給紳士好得下台。聽說宋主任已抱定外交可以談判，主權不可損失的決心，準備和港府淸算這個時起時伏的懸案，同時電訟寳安縣府，從速呈報九龍城戶口，（計一三五戶，共一六八七人）以利交涉進行。（本報特約記者伍洋）</p>

<h3>魯西南行　鄆城濟寗</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日航訊〕魯西南在中國歷史上一向就是「好漢」蒼萃之所，民性强悍，尙武重義，「水滸傳」中的梁山泊就在鄆城東北及黃河運河中間地區。山的週圍凡十餘里，中多洞穴，易于藏匿，山中主要村莊凡三，各二百餘戶，中有一小土瓦房，凡三間，據傳爲「忠義堂」　址。每屆夏秋，河水陡漲，山即被水所　繞，入冬水落，河底乾涸，又成黃沙一片。據我在此次旅行中所遇鄆城來人談：即在承平時期，梁山亦爲「好漢」出沒之處，與匪無來往者不敢入。迄今鄆城尙遺留有烏龍院遺跡二處：其一在城內西南角，係一　水池。一在城南二里，係一土堆，究竟何者係宋江殺閻雪姣處，已不可考，不過鄆城人當你提起烏龍院時，都會普邇地表示不高興，正如稱頭腦陳舊的山東老鄉爲「大哥」一樣。郓城及梁山現仍皆在共匪盤據之中，鄆城先後失守凡九次。</p>
<p>濟寗位運河之濱，原爲魯西南經濟中心，過去整個魯西南所產小麥，皮革等，皆集結於此，津浦路並自此築一支綫與兗州連繫，故商業繁盛，其重要性遠過査州而上之。南門城樓上有「太白樓」，並有賀知章李太白塑像。宋明以來，各代名人題字甚多。城外東關「浣筆泉」，亦係名勝。城內第一首富爲孫玉堂醬園，該園創自明代，已歷四五百年，前淸時出世狀元，現尙擁有大醬缸八千隻，其蓋全係錦製。今夏共匪圍攻濟寗時，西南兩關房屋被毀不少，縣城雖獲保全，但因魯西南嘉祥，鉅野，城武，定陶等多尙在匪手，物資被匪封鎖，故市况蕭條，遠非昔比矣。（本報特派員麗天）</p>
<h3>慶祝電信紀念日特刋　郁堅題　三十六年十二月二十八日　詮釋電信紀念日之意義</h3>
<p>— 郁秉堅</p>
<p>國家遇有大興作之典或有非常之事業，足留傳久遠爲後人景仰崇慕者，率命歲之一日，以埀永久紀念，故工商有節，國家有慶，所以昭示國人，繼往開來，用意良善。今値吾國首屆電信紀念日，堅不才，請詮釋其義，以彰命名之由來。</p>
<p>溯有淸同光之季，朝政廢弛，外侮日亟，縉紳之士，多因循巽懦，故步自封，獨北洋通商大臣直隸總督李鴻章攘斥衆議，力主自强運動，毅然採用西洋科學文明，以倡導新政，電信事業，賴以傳入吾國。光緒五年（西曆一八七九年）李鴻章於大沽砲台架設電纜，以達天津，試通軍訊，六年奏准創辦南北洋電報，規定棧路由天津循運河經濟寗淸江浦鎭江蘇州而達上海，七年設津滬電報總局於天津，派盛宜懷爲總辦。同年舊曆十一月初八日（即陽曆十二月二十八日）天津上海間綫路完成，收發電報，開放公甩，是爲吾國自辦電信業務之始。</p>
<p>夫電信交通之於國家，猶人體之神經系統，在國防政治經濟實業文化均佔極重要之地位，故電路之修短，機械之良竄，足爲推測國力强弱與文化盛衰之準則，試觀歐美諸文明國家，電信綫路，如羅如網，縱橫貫通，此所以視遠邦如比隣，連全國爲一體也。返觀吾國，在抗戰前數年，亦呈欣欣向榮之象，惜以對日戰事爆發，原有設施，多遭毀損，抗戰期間，雖物資缺乏，設備不足，但仍能上供軍需，下給民用。旣而夷酋請降，復員東歸，當軸因電信建設重要，戮力以赴，兩年以來，胼手胝足，規模觕具，然展望未來，尤覺事業業鉅，任重道遠。</p>
<p>邇者，交通當軸，以戰後電信建設，基礎已具，爲謀加緊改進，普遍發展業務起見，明令規定以每年十二月二十八日即我國電信事業發　之第一日，爲電信紀念日，令各地電信機關於是日普遍舉行業務檢討，寓勵治於紀念之中，而求新生之不息，蘊義深長，彌足珍視，顧電信乃公衆通訊之工具，革新改進，有賴社會各方之合作輔導，今欣逢首屆電信紀念日，謹誌數言，幸就敎於世之君子云爾！</p>
<h3>電信界對電信紀念日應有之認識</h3>
<p>— 趙立</p>
<p>抗戰以前，我國電信事業，已呈現出蓬勃氣象，向新興之途前進，對於國內電報國際電報以及市內電話長途電話等，均有長足之進展，設無日寇之瘋狂侵略，時至今日，吾電信事業之一切新設施新計劃早可如期完成，必另有一番新氣象。溯自七七事變爆發八二二滬戰繼起，以至演成神聖偉大之全面抗戰。在此時期中，電信因係軍事之耳目，必須維持軍訊之暢通，故電信員工之責任與工作，頓趨繁重，其後國軍內移，政府西遷，電信員工，亦隨同撤退，於是在內地各省建設新通信網，配合軍事需要。但是在此時期，非特器材缺乏，外貨來源斷絕，再加敵人砲火之摧燬與轟炸之猛烈，一經建造，即遭破壞，艱難困苦，靡堪言述。幸賴電信員工冒險犯難之精神，不屈不撓，埋頭苦幹，得以克服一切困難，完成最艱巨之使命。故此一時期，堪稱電信史上最艱苦亦最光榮之一頁。</p>
<p>卅四年八月，抗戰勝利，因電信爲傳達政令促進經濟文化工商業等之重要工具，故又在各業之前，儘先復員，除先後恢復陷區原有電信機構及通訊設備外，並接收東北及台灣之電信事業，加以積極之整理，同時就報話業務較繁之各大都市加强其機件設備，改進其通訊效能，力求電信之迅速正確而使其發展。兩年以來，已具相當成就，獲得社會好評。惟目前器材之補充，尙屬有限，電信人才之培養，猶感不足，加以國內軍事尙在進行，社會經濟猶呈動盪現象，欲實行全面性之建設，仍多掣肘，以致電信設施，尙未能完全配合進步之時代，適合人民之需要，而得與歐美先進國家相頡頏。</p>
<p>交通當局為提高電信員工之警覺性以及喚起人民之注意力，特選定六十六年前第一次開放商報之十二月二十八日爲電信紀念日。今日爲吾第一屆電信紀念日，亦為吾國有史以來電信界之大紀念日，吾等於慶祝歡欣之餘，應如何警惕，對過去應作總檢討，對將來更須擬具遠大計劃，使全國人民咸能明暸國家重視電信之眞實意義，進而獲得人民之支助，共同建設新電信。年年今日，每個電信從業人員，均能檢討過去計劃未來，配以抗戰期間所表現之苦幹精神，努力以赴，則三年小成，十年大成，電信前途必無限光明，願與電信界同仁共勉之。</p>
<h3>吾國境內　海底電綫之沿革</h3>
<p>— 華士鑑</p>
<p>海底電綫乃有綫電之一種，其製，以銅絲爲心，外包特種樹膠爲絕緣體，襯以麻繩，再用竹著粗細之鋼綫裏緾，形似鋼素，粗者如臂，細者如指，况佈海底，旣重且堅，綿互千百里，電流藉此最內層之銅心，經浩瀚之海底，傳達彼岸，實爲電氣通信利器之一。吾國戰前，上海天津間有海綫兩條，用高速度報機傳遞華北報務，頗資利賴，戰時被寇盜去，迄今未能恢復。茲將吾國境內海綫之沿革，略述如左，　滬港綫同治十年（一八七一）丹麥商大北電報公司之海綫，由香港經廈門之　浪嶼，放至上海吳淞，長九百五十海里，是為外人在吾國經營電信事業之始，該公司在上海黃浦灘設局（今通商銀行後面房屋內）營業，其始祇收發洋文電，嗣乃創編四字碼，收發華文報，（當時該公司所編之華文四碼電報書，與現行者不同，幫現行之電報書，又稱電報新編）。同年英商大東電報公司亦自香港經福州之川石山，放海綫至寳山，長九百二十四海里，與大北公司同處營業。同治十二年，以電報由吳淞寳山差人遞送至上海為不便，該公司等擅自架設陸錢與海綫聯接，通至上海，此事經我政府抗議多次，乃議定由政府備價將桿錢收回，借給公司運用，以保主權。　滬烟沽第一綫，光緒二十六年（一九〇〇）拳匪之亂，華北陸上電報桿錢被毀，八國聯軍入京，因南北消息梗阻，大東大北兩公司，乃乘隙自天津附近之大沽口至吳淞，放設海綫，中問在烟台登岸，長七百二十九海里，電政督辦盛宣懷，欲阻不能，乃作價英金二十一萬磅收回，當時無此鉅款，訂期三十年，以在該綫上收發之報費，按年攤還本息，在未淸償前，該綫由兩公司代辦代管，直至民國十九年十二月二十二日，始由吾國收回自管，二十六年抗戰軍興，該綫阻斷不通，旋被敵盜移他處。　滬烟沽第二綫民國十一年，交通部因國際及華北電報業務增加，乃添放滬烟沽第二海綫，向日本古河公司訂造，長七百二十海里，抗戰時同被敵寇盜移。　徐聞海口綫光緒三十四一年（一九○八），電報總局因海南島孤懸海外自書州半島徐聞縣屬海岸起，佈設海錢，經瓊州海峽而至海南島之海口止，計長十五海里，經工竣通報，惟嗣後即阻斷不通。　川淡綫福州海口之川石山至台北之淡水口，有海錢一條，光緒十三年（一八八七）放設，長一百十七海里，當時吾國有礮艇改裝之水錢船一艘名「飛策」，專事修理此錢，甲午（一八九四）中日之戰，合灣被割，該綫於光緖二十四年售日本，水綫船隨之廢棄。　烟威綫光緒二十六年英商大東公司乘卷匪之亂由烟台設海綫至威海衛，長四十一海里，民國十九年十月英國交還威海衛，該綫同時收回。　威劉綫自威海衛至該處附近海中之劉公島，有報話海綫各一條，各長二海里，亦由大東公司於光緒二十六年放設，民國十九年與烟威綫同時收回。　烟大綫烟台至遼東半島之大連，有海綫一條，長九十海里，初爲俄國所設，光緒三十一光（一九〇五）日俄戰後，歸日本佔有，光緒三十四年與日本議定，該綫離烟台七海里半之一段，歸我國所有。　靑佐綫光緒二十三年（一八九七）德國佔山東膠州灣後，安設海錢一條，由靑島至烟台，二十六年乘拳匪之亂，復展設至上海，民國三年，第一次歐戰，日本對德宣戰，攻陷靑島，割取此綫，改放靑島與日本佐世保間，長五百三十七海里，民國十年華盛頓會議，屢經交涉收回，十三年底，議定分割該錢之一半，計二百六十八海里零，歸我國所有，靑島一端之收發權，亦由我收回。　滬崎綫同治十年（一八七一）丹商大北公司放設吳淞至日本長崎之海綫二條，各約長四百八十海里，該公司復由長崎設海錢二條至海參崴，接通俄國陸綫，以達歐洲。　　上海雅浦綫　光緖三十年（一九〇四）德意志荷蘭電報公司，安設水綫，由太平洋之雅浦島（北緯十度東徑百四十度附近）至寳山登陸而達上海，長一千七百七十七海里，並在福州路四川路轉角設立報房，民國三年，日本對德宣戰，雅浦一段被日本割　，移放他處，寳山一段，先由駐滬荷蘭領事收管，我國對德宣戰後，屢向荷領催取，不肯交出，我政府所接收者，祇福州路德和公司房屋一所，從前之上海電報局，於民國十年自福州路外灘一里　內，遷入該屋辦公，即現在之上海電信局總營業處也。　　日本滬崎綫，民國二年日本在長崎寳山間，放設海綫，長四百六十八海里，在上海熙業德路天潼路轉角設置報房，初名日本郵便局，後稱日本電信局，收發日本各處與上海間電報，抗戰時日敵利用此錢，傳遞軍電，異常活躍，三十年以後，因滬淞賽間地纜阻斷，不能通報，三十四年秋，抗戰勝利，局屋由我接收，即今之海岸電台與電信局分辦事處也　　上海馬尼拉綫光緒二十八年（一九〇二）美商太平洋水錢電報公司，放設海綫自菲律賓之馬尼拉至寳山，長一千二百六十四海里，廿九年擅設陸綫接通上海，收發中美電報，卅年訂立合約，許其登陸，惟所設陸錢，交與我國，作爲我國產業。　　厦門海防綫光緒廿六年法國電報公司，乘我匪亂，擅由海防之都蘭，放綫至厦門之鼓浪嶼，約長八百海里，公然開局營業，屢經交涉撤除無效，嗣後此錢阻斷不通，民國十三年，法方欲將此斷綫售與我國，未允其請。　　龍口大連綫民國三年，日本對德宣戰，攻陷靑島後，由龍口况佈海綫至大連，約長一百十里，此綫之兩端，皆在吾國領海之內，日本自知違約，於是年十月將綫撤去。　　大連佐世保綫大連長崎綫此二綫前爲日本所放設，抗戰勝利，自應沒收歸我。以上乃吾國境內海綫之大概情形。大東公司之賽山香港錢，原中途在川石山登陸，與福州接通。大北公司之吳淞香港錢，中途在鼓浪嶼登陸，與厦門接通，依照舊合問規定，各該公司可在福州，川石山。厦門。鼓浪嶼。四處，設局收發電報，民國十九年底，合同期滿後，所有公司在上述四處所設之電局，即隨之撤消。二十二年五月，交通部收回大北大東太平洋三公司在上海接收及投送水綫電報權，各該公司在愛多亞路所設之水綫電報收發處，由吾國收回改組。上海至吳淞。寳山係我國領土，非經我國許可，不得將海錢牽引上陸，各該公司之登陸權，俱於民國十九年底滿期，嗣後續准延長十四年，至民國三十三年年底，又復期滿矣。查海綫一經放設，風雨不能侵，狂瀾未由折，傳報穩定而秘密，觀日寇自二十六年戰事爆發後，戎馬倥偬，仍於台灣。馬尼拉·香港·廣州·海南島·海防·新嘉坡，婆羅州·荷屬東印度諸地，添放海綫甚多，足徽無錢電與陸錢外，無論國防上商業上，海錢仍佔重要之地位，吾國電信事業，被外來之巨綆束縛久矣，當此奮發有爲之時，讀者亦將有動於中乎？</p>

<h3>中國電信事業史話</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>（一）有綫電報</p>
<p>有錢電報創辦最早，咸同年間（約公元一八六一——一八七四年）淸廷準備架設桿錢，試辦電報，但當時民智未開，各地農民鑒於樹立電桿，要破壞他們的土地和祖墳，羣起搗毀，工程無法進行。直至公元一八七九年（光緒五年）李鴻章在天津大沽間試設軍用電錢，成效卓著，纔奏准架設自天津循遝河而至上海的南北洋電錢，於公元一八八一年陽曆十二月二十八日開始收發商電。</p>
<p>如上所述，有綫電報在孕靑時期，就已遭遇到農民的搗毀，誕生之後，從淸末到北伐成功爲止，前有革命起義，後有軍閥內亂，隨時遭遇破壞，祗有從民十六年國府成立起到二十六年抗戰爆發爲止，這短短的十年中，時局比較安定，纔有積極建設的機會，抗戰時期沿江沿海地區相繼淪陷，錢路楊器損失極大，直到戰後二年的今天，除西南一帶的綫路因戰時建設較前增加外，其他收復各區，不但元氣還沒有恢復，而且有些地區，續受戰亂破壞之中。</p>
<p>（二）有綫電話</p>
<p>吾國自營的市內常話，是一九〇〇年從南京電報局兼辦市內電話業務開始的，當時全京祗有常話十四戶，專供官署通話，後來增加設備，兼供民用並逐漸擴充至各大都市，民十六年後發展尤快，所有各大都市的市內電話，大都改用自動電話，載至民二十五年爲止，全國部辦的電話總容量共有七萬多號，長途電話亦已完成九省通話網，戰時因電話機件笨重，不易運帶，損失慘重，戰後積極恢復，已有良好成績，據三一十六年六月底的統計，現有部辦市內電話總容量共達十六萬七千除號，較戰前增加一倍以上，長途電話亦已通達全國。</p>
<p>（三）無綫電報</p>
<p>早在公元一九〇五年，吾國已開始試辦無綫電報，但初期成績不彰，祗供軍用。民十六年國府定都後，經交通部和建設委員會競設各地短波電台，無綫電報纔開始供作商用，經過十年的苦幹，進展神速，尤其是自從目動機器應用於無綫電通訊後，功效更爲加强，戰時有綫電頻遭破壞，後方遠距離通訊，幾全靠無綫電聯絡，這種現象，直到現在，仍未改變。</p>
<p>吾國各種電信建設，大概都從政治中心區城開始，惟有國際無錢電通訊，却先由關外興辦。一九二七年張作霖統治東三省時，在潘陽設立大電力電台與德法兩國通報，當時關內各地發往國外的電報，都須經洛陽接轉。至國際無綫電台，係於一九二八年（民十七年）開始創辦，當時無綫電通信事業仍由交通部和建設委員會分掌，雙方同時籌設國際電台，後來交建合併，事權集中，進行加速，規模宏大的交通部國際電台，纔於十九年十二月六日正式開幕，並於開幕前先已與馬尼拉開始通報。截至目前爲止，國際電台共有收發訊機二十餘部，業訊總電力共達四百基羅安。現有直達國際通報電路二十二條，國際通話電路一條，量近並在各主要電路改用電傳打字機和多工電報機設備，前者能使傳遞電報絕對準確，後者能使傳遞速率增加四倍並可保證機密。</p>
<p>（四）無綫電話</p>
<p>無錢電話在戰前已開放國內滬粵滬漢及國際問中日中美無錢電話業務。戰後國際無錢電話已恢複中美一路，中英通話亦將於三十七年年初開放。至國內遠距離長途通話，都已改用無綫電話電路。</p>

<p>紡建開董事會　決定今後營業方針</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨上午十時召開董事會議，董事長陳啓天主席，會議延至下午二時始散，茲探誌各情大要如次。</p>
<p>報吿事項：（一）紡建所屬各廠，本年全年生產量，計棉紗七四二〇〇〇件，棉布一五，九四八，〇〇〇疋，毛織品二，〇五八，○〇〇碼，毛紗二，五七六，〇〇〇磅，蔴錢八，五四四，一〇〇〇碼，蔴袋布四，八八五，〇〇〇碼，絹絲五一五，〇〇〇磅，絲織品一，六九七，〇〇〇碼，針織品中內衣坯布三二，六〇〇疋，成衣七八六，〇〇〇件，羅紋三，四〇〇條，印染加工布四，五四一，〇〇〇疋，紗帶一九八，〇〇○磅。（二）外銷自本年六月份起，迄目前爲止，計値美金三，九八六，八七七元，英金二，〇二〇，二〇六鎊，叨幣一，二一九，五四〇元，羅比四一三，九三〇元，以上共値美金一四，一五五，五二五元。（三）各地棉花存品之損失，計包括石家莊，隴海路，東北等地，共値五千億元。（四）全年對外捐款，計軍事攤派九百餘億元，普通捐款一百億元。</p>
<p>討論事項：（一）靑島各廠因缺煤停工，茲上海燃管會已允先撥借三千噸，秦皇島亦可派到二千噸，公司在滬搜羅一千七百噸，故短期內暫可支持。至以紗易取印煤，興會董事僉認與其停工損失，實應以紗易煤，決由經部與輸管會洽商。（二）紗管會委託收購配銷等業務，均可考慮接受。惟僅屬商業性之代營，不負任何行政賣任。（三）公司棉紗掛牌，現有議價及紗市塲開價二種，頗不劃一，議決視統購統銷政策施行後果如何再定。（四）公司木年遭遇三大困難？（甲）軍部欠款，（乙）國行代紡，（丙）議價損失。致本年表面雖云盈餘一萬億元，然物質存量實屬减少。如棉花一項，即較去年减少五十餘萬担。茲者統購統銷政策實施，實際盈餘更少。望政府明年開列預算時，對公司勿過存奢望。</p>
<h3>浮多了結者夥　華股臨收見疲</h3>
<p>華股昨　忽不定，傳說不一，一般活動者咸感徬徨岐途，空方集團在塲外雖有補進，但因存多泰半了結，以致無甚影響，中途之一度蠢動，嫌缺後勁，臨收反以疲熊結束，小型股情况較前略有改進。</p>
<p>初以謠傳遞交不能過年，彩響人心，開出慘跌。永紗以五三七元及五三五元之價開盤，又呈倒掛，即交股開後曾低至五三五元，後買至五四七元，現遞同價，而見稍盤。塲外息價開低至一角八及二角二分半，曾漲達即交五五二元，及遞交五五七元高價。旋又逐漸盤低至五四〇元內。以是際有力購即交及　交者曾回升至五四五元左右。但仍乏維持，而降至即交五三二元，遞交五三四元低價。午收爲五三六元及五三九元。永公及各小型股尙形平和，中泥成交不多，退至低價結束。結果較前即交股計新華五和大通尙平，中尼跌一成，半成，永業升半成，永紗閘北信和美亞景福中法內衣火柴商務統益各低少許，餘均微升。遞交股　與華　跌半　左右，餘均微降</p>
<h3>統債平庸外股盤旋</h3>
<p>公債昨平庸少變，統丙　開三〇七〇〇元，即吿下游至二九四〇〇元，而後回升至三〇〇〇〇元關外徘徊。結果較前收計甲乙丁均平，丙降四百元，戊跌三百元，成交不過三百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨亦盤旋而已，怡紗　開四二三〇〇〇元，高價不過四二六〇〇〇元，低價亦僅四一六〇〇〇元，而後以徘徊姿熊收市。銀行帮洋行帮有　，廣帮及散戶則買，結果較前收計英聯航業電車祥泰均平，墾植跌半成，餘股榮　俱微。</p>
<h3>紗布平疲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開尙堅穏，後傳民營紗廠將火量拋售，市塲人心頓轉虛軟，更以假期日近，同業與客幫均少活動，交易頗淸，塲內僅逢低略進而已。全日趨勢，以四十二支寳光紗複製廠商有收吸，及十六支光明天女粗紗，客帮採辦，行情步漲十萬元。四二支藍鳳及金城等，供求相埒，價無榮辱。此外各支粗細紗大部軋小一二十萬至七八十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布因國曆年關日近，銀根軋緊，同業吐售甚夥，更以統購統銷辦法，即將實施，市勢可能穩定，塲內人心渙散，買戶均有轉賣活動，並聞染廠需用現款，有大批現貨售出。且紡建公司又屆開布之期，配額充裕，山西帮頭寸軋緊，拋出現　碼甚多，市塲中賣氣籠罩，價乃直綫下降。最後十二磅龍頭細塲外價格比上日跌落二萬元，其餘各檔細布，亦步降目一萬五千至二·三萬元。全日趨勢以跳鯉漂布，漢口帮有進，軋升二萬元，灰光　洋傘廠吸納略形悄俐外其他各布市氣呈明定　軟之局。</p>
<h3>銀根平穩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨因大量現鈔流滬，銀根平穩，暗崽二角四左右。四行二局差進一四五五億，中央入九八三億，大交換出二七四億，外商入一一九億，小交換出一三〇〇憶，中　入三六四億，交通出一九八億，中農入一三八億，中信局八一九七億。</p>
<h3>民營工業價購日賠物資　經部訂定付款辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部頃已訂定民營工業價購日本賠償物資付款辦法，由工商輔導處通知各地廠家。辦法內規定，凡申請價購賠償品之廠家，於核定價購，應即與經部訂立交貨繳款契約。如承購物資價格已評定者，即依政院公佈之民營事業申請價配日本賠償物資辦法第六條辦理。如該物資之作價尙屬初步估計者，則應先繳按估價百分之五之保證金。如物資由日本港口起運，尙未抵達我國港口期內，則繳納初估全部價款百分之十五。如全部物資業已抵達，則百分之十五之貨價應與保證金同時繳納。其餘百分之六十五之貨款，則准分兩年繳淸，一切貨價，均以美金計算。惟承購之民營事業，每期繳款時，得按央行市價折合國幣支付；至於運費一項，則須由承購者一次付淸。</p>
<h3>人造絲徵昂　廠經平綢貨跌</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市再呈微昂，因中信局下週停配一期，人心爲之稍定·一二〇號旭字一A有光，上午開盤七千九百萬元，午收盤爲八千萬元即期價。週一期上午八千一百五六十萬元有成交，下午較軟，午後即低至一百萬元。嚴後更降至八千〇五十萬元，结果比上日大一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市交易寂寥，行情尙稱穩定。CD等級喊價仍在八千六七百萬元之左，高另担五百萬元左右，中級另担三百萬元左右，均與上日行情相仿。干經亦乏成交，市價並無變化。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市　絲被面挫降，華強貨開市仍堅，在五百三十四十萬元左右，　因供求不均，喊價步趨下降，收市即期做四百七十萬元，比上日短五十萬元，週一期做五百千萬元。大誠格子璧　隨小二千元，爲十三萬五千元。其餘各貨，廠盤均堅站朱更。</p>
<h3>米市堅定　油價飛漲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共糧一萬五千一百餘石，南市先挺後懈，結果粳秈米均無榮辱，白元高俏次呆，陰元亦然定局。北市胃呆帶疲。麵粉再漲達限度，麩皮亦續向高峯疾進，豆餅銷化仍淡，惟原料昂貴，貨主仍堅。黃豆客帮納胃淸淡，本街動而不旺，但油廠繼續猛吸，進胃暢旺，內地報升，客心益堅，杜黃再升二三萬元，客豆中關升三四萬元。菉豆南洋略進，升萬餘元，赤豆微升萬元，　豆本街銷化平平，帶起萬元，豇豆隨之上　一二萬元。紅糧散戶收購，酒坊納胃不弱，奔騰二三萬元，苞米北洋銷路轉呆，回挫萬元，生仁廣　本街互相爭取，按步上升，再漲三五萬元。</p>
<p>汕市因甬帮　辦，天津亦有染指，扶搖直上，各油相繼飛騰十餘萬至二十萬元不一，臨收略見軟化。</p>
<h3>碼頭提貨如有短少應報吿海關驗貨員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關昨公吿，查商人在碼頭提貨時，應先將所提貨物，詳加檢點，如發現有短少情事，應於貨物未　完以前，當塲向駐碼頭海關騐貨員報吿，經由騐貨員查實後，在放行單上駐明，以憑核辦。茲規定自卅七年一月一日起，提貨商人如遇有貨物短少情事，而不於提貨時向在塲關員报吿，經其　明簽證者，本關對於短卸情形，旣無從確定，概不予承認，該商不得於事後向本關有何請求云。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨例售布，共售一一三八〇疋申購單三一六張，內廠商七張，購布八四〇疋，布號三〇九張，購布一〇五四〇疋。</p>
<p>大衣呢銷路滯</p>
<p>呢絨市面，昨來趨勢仍以薄貨爲佔優勝地位，厚貨除羢類外，餘如大衣呢平厚呢麥而登等，俱多縮疲下降，雖天氣嚴寒，大衣呢正當及時暢銷，然大半均欲推銷自己存貨，本客帮絕無再有預先添進之意。且因聖誕節已過，各路實銷已過大半，普通一般顧客，十之七八對冬裝早已定製舒齊，故邇來祗有零星剪銷，絕乏原疋整箱成交。</p>
<h3>祁门去化旺</h3>
<p>茶市因供求迄未趨入活潑狀態，致交易毫無異彩，過程遂仍岑静而少起仆。茲據業中人云：邇來本街店莊對於本年度特祁門，尙有　涎欲滴之勢，惜該項花色，市存寥若晨星，故頗呈不敷分配之局面，預測售價前途，恐有迭向前進之望。</p>
<h3>中信易貨處解釋　中日易貨情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中信局易貨處某負責人語記者：日本來貨仍陸續不　，今日目有枕木一批抵滬。目前與日本易貨之各國，除美國外，英澳等國均有透支，不獨我國爲然，而我國透支之數額，在盟國中並非最大者。透支造成之原因有兩：一爲今年木擬有食鹽一百萬噸運日，但因先顧及內銷起見，實際用於易貨者，僅爲二十萬噸；二爲原有　砂輸日，後由　委會辦理，以獲取外匯，此批鐵砂遂改售於英國。明年度中日之易貨數　，因雙方在內邵經濟上均有困难，不致有大員之提高。我方希望自日本輸入者，除交通及工礦器材外，尙有人造絲；我國之也口仍以貪　爲大宗，可能有一部份鐵砂。至於合糖大豆，，仍盼以剩餘出口，惟以獲得現款爲條件。今年台糖出口之收獲爲五百萬美金，大豆爲一百萬美金，希望明年度更能提高。</p>

<h3>廿九軍三忠烈　矮簷回憶之三</h3>
<p>二十六年七月之尾，宋哲元率軍撤守，北平陷敵。倭軍當日雖未進城，而愁雲慘霧，天地變色，舊都人士最感佩的，是南苑陣亡的趙登禹佟麟閣兩將軍，最笑罵的是繼宋而就任冀察政委長的張自忠將軍。都說宋哲元走了，趙登禹死了，張自忠降了。三人皆二十九軍之中堅而有黨　之判，或稱怪事。</p>
<p>張自忠上台數日，亦即離平，參加抗戰，後竟於鄂境陣亡，殉國英　，心跡大白。宋哲元亦轉戰積勞，歿於西蜀。勝利後，平西八寳山忠烈祠，張佟趙三公神位苜先高拱。俎豆馨香，受萬人之崇拜，八實山即前者倭人祀其所謂「忠靈」之地，眼前果報，尤足大快人心。</p>
<p>二十九軍全部退陣之後，倭人選城，由所謂「地方維持會」者勉强支特，至歲尾，而偽「臨時政府」忽然出現，其組織之中堅人物之姓名屬「七陽韻」，王克敏，王揖唐，湯爾和，汪時璟，後又添一王蔭泰焉。而三「王」又更迭爲僞「華北委會委員長」，人稱此僞會爲「王家老店」。在江南則僞「維新政府」頭目之梁（鴻志）亦是七陽韻，僞「國府」頭目汪（兆銘）又是七陽韻，可謂「無巧不成書」。</p>
<h3>奇人奇事</h3>
<p>— 文基</p>
<p>有某甲者，投河自盡，爲警察所見，投了一根繩子給他，命他爬上岸來，可是他死意已決，堅不肯執繩，警士怒，聲言將開槍把他擊死，某甲這才遵命，爬上岸來。</p>
<p>有一天夜報上登載了二則新聞，其中一則是記一個百萬富翁，爲了事業失敗，財產只剩了二萬五千元，所以自殺了。另一則是記一個苦力，中了彩票的頭獎，獲得了二萬五千元，喜極，乃市酒狂歡，以資慶視，孰知喝醉了酒，不愼喪生。</p>
<p>世界七怪之一，眼睛耳雙口啞的美國奇女子海倫。凱拉有一次赴英國，偕愛斯透夫人去見英國的怪男子蕭伯納，發生了如左的一段對白：</p>
<p>海倫·凱拉說：「我和你會面，心裏眞是高興。我久想和你認識。」</p>
<p>蓋伯納反詰道；「爲什麼一切的美國人都同樣的說這句話？</p>
<p>海倫·凱拉說：「你爲什麼這樣憎恨我們美国人？」</p>
<p>蕭伯納答道：「我並不憎恨你們。」語氣之問頗有美國人不值得他憎恨之意。</p>
<p>海倫·凱拉問道：「那末你爲什麼不到美國去呢？」</p>
<p>「爲什麼我要到美國去？全美國的人會來見我的。」</p>
<p>愛斯透夫人把手按在蕭的手臂上把他推了一下，一如他是一個在客人之前行爲失態的小孩子。她對蕭說：「你不知道這位是海倫·凱拉麼？她是耳　眼瞎的</p>
<p>他的答　想來來一定是使在座的人大爲吃驚的，可是海倫·凱拉沒有立刻知道他說的是什麼，因爲傳譯人的手語突然停止了，她滿　狐疑地等待着。過了一回傳譯人才以手語吿訴她蕭所說的話。</p>
<p>「這有什麼希奇！一切的美國人是耳聾眼瞎——而且是口啞的。」</p>
<h3>度量</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>耶穌說：「有人摑你的右頰，再把左頰送給他。」這是基督敎徒敎人「寬宏大量」的作法。雖然世間未必價有這等事，但是將度量的尺度放寬，能够容忍別人，原恕別人，究竟不失爲一種美德。</p>
<p>在東方，尤其在我們這個處處講求中庸講求忠恕之迫的國家，對於氣量大的人固然祟敬得無微不至，而於箴勸一般人要將氣量放大也是無徵不至的。譬如有人常將「小不忍，則亂大謀」的警語，拿出來做「和事老」，希望彼此不要因爲氣量狹小，感情衝動，以致陷在狹縫里自苦自擾，還有，更使人容易咀嚼和了解的一句話，那便是「宰相肚里好撑船」。他不說「措大肚子好撑船」，而偏偏抬出「宰相」的大　十來，自然由於「宰相」在專制時代，乃是「一人之下，萬人之上」的大人物之故。</p>
<p>唯其是「宰相肚里好撐船」，所以在古人中也的確有着許多使人敬仰其「寬宏大量」的大人物在。隨便舉一二則故事來說，一個是唐代的中興名將郭子儀；一個是宋初的太尉王且。都是最好不過的典型例十：</p>
<p>據史載：公（郭子儀）入朝，魚朝恩邀之游章敬寺，元載恐其相結，密使告公曰：「朝恩謀不利於公。」公不聽。將士請裏甲以從，公曰：「我國之大臣，彼無天子之命，安敢害我？若受命而來，汝曹欲何爲？」乃促家僮數人而往。朝恩驚問其故，乃以所聞吿，且曰：「恐煩公經營耳！」朝恩撫齊流涕曰：「非公長者，能無疑乎？」郭公處於羣小環鬥之中，而能泰然處之，此非有極大的度量何熊致之？</p>
<p>又據厚德錄云：王太尉旦荐寇萊公爲相。萊公數短太尉於上，而太尉專稱其長。上一日謂太尉曰：「卿雖稱其美，彼專談卿惡。」太尉曰：「理固當然，臣在相位日久，政事闕失必多；準對陛下無所隱，益足以見其忠直，此臣所以重準也。」萊公在藩鎭，嘗因生日建山棚大宴，又服用僭侈，爲人所奏。上怒甚，謂太尉曰：「寇準每事欲效朕，可乎？」太尉徐對曰：「準誠能臣，無如騃何！」上意解。這位王太尉的度量也可算大到極點了。</p>
<p>這二個故事都相當的使人感動。可是，也從而得以知道一個人之所以寬宏大量，必須具有二個基本條件：一是意念要達觀，城府要深沉；如郭令公對將士的解釋，及王旦的不與寇準爭閑氣。一是要有極其豐富的幽默感，如前者的「恐煩公經營」，後者的「無如騃何」，都是幽默得令人又愛又敬的。唯有如此，纔能平心靜氣，容納逆耳之言，即使遇到極難受的事端，也可能一笑置之。否則便不成其爲度量寬大了。</p>
<h3>路鵝凍死骨</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>話說今年夏季特別，記得赤日當空火傘高照柏油路踏上去覺得黏膠膠的某天，筆者曾見一個乞童躺在道旁電幹木頭的陰影里，藉避炎日直接的威力；影子在隨着太陽移動着，所以這位乞童得第過數分鐘把他的寶座移動一下，庶可獲得聯勝於無的影子的蔭庇。這類乞童在人海中大槪只剩一影子能够保護他的了—說得「高雅」一點，這也算是避暑。</p>
<p>且說氣候這也像電影，把鏡頭一移，轉瞬又屆狂風怒號呵氣成冰的嚴冬。却說我家莽外空地上放着一個衣櫥樣的木屋—以形狀尺寸論，是一個衣櫉，可是里面住着一個家，所以只好稱之爲「屋」。倒也分作上下二層，下層放置什物。有一天我晚上回家，走過這個木屋，只聽得里面一個幼童的聲音說道：「冷呀！」他的娘答道：「那未我門抱着睡吧。」幼童問道：「娘呀，我們什麼時候再可搬入屋子里去呢？」「搬到那個正在建造的房子里去嗎？」「那個房子什麼時候可以造成呀？」這個「家」實在還算是「比下有餘」的。</p>
<p>且說寒風刺骨的某天，筆者在馬路上看見一個所謂「癟三」，蓬頭垢面，骨搜如柴，走路竟像一根自動的木頭，上身空着一件破舊污　汗背心，下體吊着一條屁股也蓋不住的破短褲，身子非常細，所謂「柳腰」是也，四肢好像樹技，一個人能瘦小乾癟到如此地步眞是始料所不及的，看來像是反映於哈哈鏡里的狹型人；俗語「骨瘦如柴」，至今始覺信然。他赤着足在寒風中曳行着，眼睛直視，不注意週圍的一切，直是一根名符其受的Walking　Stick。此人大概眞是已「置生死於度外」了，不再有希望，不再有思慮，一切都已不在乎；馬路上有什麼可吃的像菜葉之類便拾來吃些；要排洩時便排洩，要睡時便檢可睡之處隨便躺下—一切人之所以稱做人的都已被熄滅了，只剩下了最簡單的生物的動作。有人打他時，決不還擊，只是曳步逃走；如果有人追他，他只是走得快些田；如果人家不追了，他也就曳步如前，眼睛直視，又滿不在乎週圍的一切了。有一次我家老阿媽早晨菜市回來，籃中一條活的魚冷不防被這樣的一位癟三了去，他逃了數步便像餓狗樣的啃着生魚吃了，阿媽追去，他把魚揣在懷里裝無事人一般。阿媽對他說：「我知道你是餓了，可是生魚吃了是要生病的，而且主人處又難以交代，你還給了我，我給你錢。」癟三見錢，便把那條活的魚揣了出來象有點所謂幽默感了。</p>
<p>且說又是一個寒風凜冽雨雪交織的早晨，筆者走過本市福州路，在一個穹門之下看見四五乞童坐在水門汀上互相擁抱着取暖，狀頗親暱，其意味與舞榭中勇女互抱着跳舞頗不相同—人與人間國與國問只要能似這些乞童那樣親暱，筆者深信天下一定可以太平了。再過去不多路在一鐵門旁述，又見一堆乞童，約十餘人，看去年齡總在八九歲之下—也許心靈上已是成人了，也許實在年齡已在十歲以上，只因物質條件的不够，上蒼所賜的身體其生理發展也得較常人落後這麼幾年—他們排成整齊的二行，前一人的背緊貼着後一人的胸，在風雪中仰坐在地上，二行互相緊靠着，兀自酣睡未醒。眞是所謂窮人自有窮辦法，他們睡做這個樣子，後一人便成了前一人的枕頭褥子，前一人成了後一人的棉被帳子。這眞成了「相依爲命」，各個的生命在風雪之中憶合而為一個生命。這堆乞童於世間的一切一無所有，只有彼此之間的溫暖。古時有所謂「肉屏風」者，這個大概也近似了。見了這堆乞童這才體味到古人「涸澈之鮒，相濡以沫」一語之眞義。可是今日有些人兀自「立於沼上，顧鴻　麋鹿」，大概此即所謂「相忘於江湖」了。</p>
<p>這眞應了雨果「悲慘世界」中的一段話：「你們（富人）要知道天氣是不是寒冷，得查報紙上的氣候紀錄。我們不必看寒暑表，我們自身便是寒暑表！我們會覺得血管里的血凝結，覺得冰好像已經觸着了我們的心。」</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章如此良宵（二七）</p>
<p>濱齊突接到綺執要離開北平的消息，不特他任務完畢，接信之後，當晚即行趕回，下火車移，不及回家，逕赴校塲胡同，一撴電鈴，小王媽開門出來，一見是渚齋，喜得什麼似的，喊了一聲：「喲！徐先生眞回來了！老板就說：這時候火車到，一定是　回來，我紙不信……」說時，回轉身便要往報吿。堵　急住道；「你不要緊張，等我偷偷進去，給她一個冷不防，笑一笑！」小王媽一手掩嘴，輕輕笑說：「好好！」二人　着脚步，輕輕走進，剛到院內，便聽綺紉在屋內問道：「是徐先生嗎？」小王媽應道：「不是，是送信的。」接着便聽屋內唉了一聲說：「這時候不來，今天就不能回來！又連連嘆了兩聲—渚齋不由急走上台塔，小王媽搶上一步，掀開門簾，笑喊：「老板，你看，這位是誰？」說着格格的笑。這時渚齋剛邁進門檻，綺紈躺在床上，早已一眼看見，把身上蓋的毛毯一掀，露出大紅睡衣，一骨三綱五常下床來，趿上拖鞋，趕到渚齊面前，緊緊握住他的手道：「渚，你回來了！」齋徵徵一笑，見她穿得一身大紅睡衣，大紅拖鞋，秀髮紛披，愈襯托出她明眸秀　的美點，立把雙手搭在她肩上，一雙眼睛奉進她臉上，不住觀年。奇紈見這樣看她，把臉一偏，笑說：「你不認得我嗎？」渚齊仔細望她臉上，看了一會，才雙手在她肩膀上，連搖幾搖，口裹說道：「好極！好極！我最擔心你的臉上那塊傷痕，現在一絲痕跡沒有，眞是可喜！」綺紈很嬌羞地，撅着小嘴道：「什麼沒鵝，我手臂上還留一粒小疙瘩，很討厭的！」說時，隨把睡衣袖撩開，露出雪藕般手臂，指著臂一粒小紅點道，我各處傷都好了，只有這裏發膿，醫治多少天，也沒好。後來由魏大夫檢查出，裹頭鵝一塊碎玻璃屑，把牠取出才收口，現在留下一個紅小疙瘩，多末討厭！」渚齊用手撫着小疙瘩道：「我看一點也不討厭，你雪白手臂，添了一粒紅小疙瘩，愈顯得鮮艷好看。」綺紈反嬌軀一扭道：「你盡管和我開玩笑！」者齊道：「眞的，你這一　雪白的手臂，配上一粒紅豆小點，叫做「雪裹紅」。」綺紈把渚齊的手一摔，佯嗔道：「那末，我成菜乾了！」渚齊哈哈大笑。正在此時，小王媽已拎了一把熟手巾，香拂指遞給渚齊，渚齋擦過臉，又用茶潄潄口，綺紈才拉他在一張沙發，並肩坐下。渚齊問道：「你爲什麼要離開北平？」綺紈道。「我寫了多少封信，希望你回來，你總不回來！」</p>
<h3>退稿</h3>
<p>— 醜生</p>
<p>投稿的人接到編輯先生們的退稿，心裏當然是不痛快的；但編輯先生在發出這封退稿信時，實在往往也同樣的頗不舒服—誰願意平空去傷人家的感情呢？而退稿得十分婉轉，因之也就極難下筆。</p>
<p>但是據一位美國作家史帶雷德（Vincerv　Starrett）的說法，中國的編輯先生們倒是最懂得退稿的藝術的！</p>
<p>史帶雷德的新著「書與兩腿動物」一書中有云：中國人素善保全面子，編輯先生尤精此道。接着他就舉了一封退稿信爲例。信云：「我們群讀尊稿，欣喜無可限量。我們願對祖先們的英　起誓，實在從未讀到過像這樣精湛的著作。假使我們出版了你的尊稿。將來當然不能再出版任何比這本書的水準太低的書籍。而尊作是如此祟高，顯然的，在今後一萬年內決無產生同樣水準著作的可能，因之，我們無任拘歉，不得不把這本至高至聖的大作奉還。謹向你致一千次的歉意，務請原諒！」</p>
<h3>蜀犬吠堯</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　龍生畫</p>
<p>記得林語堂先生會經爲北京時代的「語絲」上一篇雜又畫過一幅「打洛水狗」的挿圖，那文章的大意是：狗雖落水，也非痛打不可，理由是狗是會泅泳的；倘不打，容恤一上岸，他便抖得你滿身的水，而且續繼向你進攻，吠，甚至於咬的。</p>
<p>重慶的狗是相當多的，時別是野狗，當我們夜工作者經過每一條黑巷時，都有許多獰大尾隨狂吠，彷彿守夜很盡職的英雄，其實却是野狗，只看巷而不看門。例如我所居的巷內，竊賊撬門，一月數次，英雄們却照例一聲不響，而被突出哎得鮮血淋漓的，乃是對門夜歸的近視限王編輯。</p>
<p>狗之繁殖在重慶，與其說是由於不像其他都市管理周密，致成無政府狀態，無寗說是人民對狗之寬容。香港在淪陷時，英美人舊的愛爾蘭種，日耳曼種狼犬，北京種叭兒狗，大抵都給中國人吃了；主人已關在集中營。重慶今天的饑民並不少，却寗可搶攤子上的燒餅，不打狗的主意，這是有關習俗的。我鵝一個朋友，在廿五年四川荒年時，由朮慶溯江而上，視察嘉陵江各縣，辦理急賑，看到災民有吃觀音土的，吃靑杠子的，而墅狗却一個個非常肥壯，因爲它們却有了更好的食料，餓殍倒斃，便由牠們犬嚼，增加了營養，養得腦滿腸肥了。問他們——災民們爲什麼不吃狗肉呢？答說：吃了狗肉怕下地獄，轉不到輸迴。我於是感到迷信勢力之偉大，當人　不擇食，把树皮草根來苟延殘喘時，爲了地獄的恐懼，會放棄眼前食料而且是佳肴，寗願把生命交付給不可想像的白泥，黏土，寗願明天死去將自己把它們　得精壯。</p>
<p>我每天看到那些上門討飯的人，便向他說敎，勸他打狗，奇怪的是目蓮救母——殺狗開齋的故事在農氏心裏生了根，而醉打山門的魯智深吃狗肉的故事，却遠不如前者。即使講因果，爲了救人而剪除惡覇的花和尙，不才是眞的値得膜拜的慈悲菩薩麼？</p>
<h3>留額金</h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>在秋季開學的時候，爲了籌集一筆小見的學費，至今彷彿還有許多債還不淸似的；却不料隔昨小兒從學校里回來，在書包中掏出一張學校給他的通吿，　來妥繳「留額金」了。小兒不懂事，還催着這筆錢須快些去繳，否則，位置便會被別人搶走，沒得書讀了。我聽了才知道他們的先生爲了這點錢，是那樣地在恐嚇無知的兒童。但在我，只好婉言安慰，證是此事爸爸會負責去辦的，不必着急。</p>
<p>其實，爸爸的責任已經到了難以負得了的地步。這學期小學的學費是五十萬元，下學期少不了得一百萬以上，而且接上去幾個小的也得跟着入學，非有二三百萬元莫辦。不要說這筆錢毫無着落，就是現在催繳的「留額金」，雖然是戔戔的二十來萬元之數，也得大費張羅。</p>
<p>說到「留額金」的制度，似乎只是行之於上海一隅，而也顯然是並不頂合理的事。現在學校當局徵繳「留額金」的藉口，諉請便於計劃招收新生數的根據，其實這說法是很勉强的。因爲，假如一定要家長表示意見，下學期子女繼續為業與否，除錢以外，別的方式很多！即使必須以　方取得信用，也不必收得這　早；使家長可鵝一個考慮的餘地—究竟敎子女繼續　下去，還是轉到別的學校去，更或者索性輟學了事！</p>

<h3>Remnants of Bandit Liu's Forces Dispersing into Small Groups and Fleeing to the Borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; National Army Landing and Deploying Defenses Near Jianli</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandit's Tenth Column, attached to Zhang Jian's Independent Brigade, are fleeing in the vicinity of Xinye. The scattered bandits who fled to the northeast of Laohekou were crushed by our annihilation forces on the 24th and also fled to Xinye.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 27th] Military News: The bandit's Twelfth Column and Zhang Jian's bandit troops in central Hubei, after being besieged and suppressed by the National Army, are now fleeing in one group towards the Dahongshan area north of Jingshan, and in another group towards Zhongxiang. There is no trace of bandits in Jingshan County. Furthermore, the bandit troops who crossed the Xiang River and occupied Qianjiang have fled to the northwest of the county. A portion of Bandit Liu's First Column merged with Wang Zhenzhou's bandit troops, attempting to attack Runan County. The Second Column, trapped in Lihuang and Shangcheng, fled southeast of Lihuang on the morning of the 25th, attempting to join forces with the Third Column in Maoping. The National Army is currently pursuing and suppressing them in multiple directions. [Central News Agency, Hankou, 27th] Military News: Since being defeated by the National Army, Bandit Liu, in order to avoid annihilation by the National Army, has dispersed into small groups and fled to the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. The main force of the First Column has fled to the area west of Xincai, including Yuecheng Runanbu. The Second Column is fleeing west from Mabao, with a unit of over a thousand fleeing to Zhangjiadian in the southeast of Liuan. The main force of the Third Column and a portion of the Sixth Column fled west of Daxiaomadian to Liulitong on the 24th, with their vanguard already reaching Maoping. A unit of the 27th Regiment of the Third Column, which remained in Xiaochiyi (northeast of Taihu), fled to Jishan on the 24th. Our defending forces are currently blocking and attacking them. The remnants of the Tenth Column, numbering over five hundred, fled northwest from Xinye to Shanglouzhai. After being blocked and attacked by the National Army on the 24th, they are now fleeing back to Xindianpu. The majority are still occupying the area of Xincheng Zaolin Dian Congtaizhen. The bandit's Twelfth Column and Zhang Jian's Independent Brigade, along with Luo Houfu's Jianghan Independent Brigade, have dispersed and fled to the Jingshan, Zhongxiang, and Yuekou areas. After the National Army used a roundabout movement, a semi-encirclement has now been formed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Chen Geng's bandit troops in central Henan have been repeatedly attacking Yancheng in recent days and are engaged in fierce battles with the defending National Army. Furthermore, a force of over 10,000 of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops fled to Shangcai on the 25th, attempting to support Bandit Chen. The National Army, dispatched from Zhumadian, has surrounded them and is currently fiercely suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 27th] The Third Column of Bandit Liu, which fled back to the Dabie Mountains, harassed Lianghekou, Qingshan, and Zhufo'an on the 26th, attempting to attack Huoshan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinyang, 27th] The main force of the bandit's Third Column is currently fleeing from south of Gushi to the northeast Wolonggang of Yejiaji and the vicinity of Lihuang, attempting to reoccupy the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 27th] There is no new movement from the Communist bandits north of Jianli. The National Army is landing and deploying defenses near Jianli by naval vessels. These bandits are Li Xiannian's troops who are harassing western Hunan.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch on the 26th] The Weichuan local militia attacked the remnant bandits in the city walls on the evening of the 25th. The bandits could not withstand the attack and retreated to the southeast, and the county seat was recovered. They are also annihilating the bandits in the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch on the 26th] From Zhaotang in the southeast of Changge to Xiannüdian in the east of Xuchang, over 10,000 bandit troops are still gathering. The Communist Wei Fenglou, Wang Wencheng, and others are looting supplies and transporting them eastward across the Yellow River Flood Area.</p>
<h3>Bandits Fleeing Around Shenyang; Multiple Sections of the Beining Railway Damaged; Pingyu Train Obstructed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The battle in Zhangwu, western Liaoning, is still continuing. The invading bandits of the Seventh Column and local communists have repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the city walls, but all have been repelled by the National Army. In recent days, the bandits have suffered nearly 10,000 casualties, and their corpses are scattered across the fields. They are showing signs of wavering.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] Bandits have infiltrated the outskirts of Shenyang again. The Fourth Column of bandits, fleeing to the northwest of Liaozhong, is being pursued by the National Army. They are acting like roving bandits. One unit of over a thousand bandits fled to the Panjiantai area, 20 kilometers southwest of Shenyang, on the morning of the 26th. The National Army is currently encircling and suppressing them. Another unit of over three thousand is also trapped in a heavy encirclement by the National Army in the northwest of Liaozhong. The bandit troops who attacked Shifo Temple (35 kilometers northwest of Shenyang) in the northwest of Heiyugou and Luojiafangshen have been repelled by the National Army and fled back.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] The problem of electricity supply in Changchun City has been partially resolved by the successful trial of power generation by burning bean cakes by the Electricity Bureau. Since the Jichang transmission line was destroyed by bandits in late October, Changchun City switched to thermal power generation. However, due to a shortage of coal, they began experimenting with bean cakes as a substitute, and recently it was successful.

<h3>Authorities to Formulate Specific Measures for Control of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The authorities have formulated specific measures for the control of daily necessities. These measures were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the "Emergency Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities" promulgated on February 3, 1941, with reference to the current actual situation. The name has been changed to "Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Speculation of Daily Necessities." They were submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd and decided to be handed over to Wang Yunwu and others for review. The content of these measures is divided into four major categories: food, clothing, use, and raw materials for daily necessities. The detailed items stipulated for control in each category are less than the original measures, but the control is strengthened, and absolute suppression measures are adopted. If there are violations, the handling will be stricter than in the past. As for the control method, the government and various trade associations will cooperate. Merchants in each industry will register their inventories with the association and report to the competent authorities, and report on the situation of incoming and outgoing goods to the association at any time. If there are illegal transactions, they will be suppressed. For inventories held by people outside the industry, the competent authorities will set a time limit for sale or sale at the location where the goods are needed. If the inventory cannot be cleared within the sales period, the competent authorities will sell it on their behalf and may purchase it at an assessed price if necessary. These measures can be promulgated and implemented after being passed at the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Vancouver, 26th] The Canadian government suddenly ordered on the 26th to stop the shipment of 650 tons of machine gun bullets and 35 tons of aircraft flares to China for supply to the Chinese National Government. Canadian public opinion has recently criticized the government a lot for the shipment of military supplies to China, accusing the government of being involved in the Chinese civil war. However, the government has not yet explained the reason for canceling the shipping order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 26th] Canadian Labor Minister Mitchell warned the Seafarers' Union today in a telegram, stating that the sailors' refusal to load military supplies to China violates the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

Another ship is now being used for transportation.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Decides to Re-examine Draft Presidential Office Organization; President Sun Points Out Organization Too Large</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The Legislative Yuan held its last meeting of the 36th year on the morning of the 27th, presided over by President Sun. First, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the State Council's instructions, and the postal rate increase case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures. Next, Liu Zhiping inquired about the process of the State Council's discussion on the adjustment of civil servant salaries. President Sun reported that the recommendations made by the Planning Committee were not very different from the original resolutions of the Legislative Yuan. However, if the new plan is implemented, the salary of civil servants alone would be more than double the total semi-annual budget. The State Council decided to hand it over to a special committee for review. The committee will meet this afternoon to continue the discussion and passed the following major cases: Regulations on the Organization of Salt Administration Bureaus in Various Regions of the Ministry of Finance; Regulations on the Organization of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau; Measures for Reassigning Demobilized Military Officers and Soldiers Who Pass the Special Examination and Transfer Examination to Civilian Positions; Regulations on Granting Land to Honored Veterans.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Legislative Yuan discussed the draft Presidential Office Organization Law on the 27th and decided to re-examine it. The original draft had 25 articles. According to a letter from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government to the Legislative Yuan: "Its content refers to the national conditions and meets the actual needs, using the organizational laws of the Civil and Military Affairs Offices as a blueprint, adopting a one-yuan system, adding a General Office, and establishing political advisory boards and strategic advisory institutions outside the Merit Evaluation Committee, in order to assist the head of state in exercising the powers conferred on the president in the Constitution. As for the accounting office and the design and assessment office, which originally belonged to the National Government, they are transferred to the Executive Yuan. The number of personnel listed is the necessary organization for presidential consultation and a very small number added due to the adoption of a one-yuan system. The personnel in the Civil and Military Affairs Offices are all from the old system and will not be increased or decreased. This arrangement is more connected than the existing organizations of various units in the National Government." The Constitutional and Legal Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed and passed the draft on the 26th. The revised draft has a total of 24 articles. When it was submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 27th for discussion, Commissioner Chen Ruxuan spoke first, criticizing the organization for being too large. Sun Jiulu said that it seemed inappropriate to retain the Military Affairs Bureau and abolish the Political Affairs Bureau. (Continued on page 2, column 4)</p>

<h3>Xiang River Tragedy: Wanxing Ship Burned</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 27th] An unprecedented tragedy of a transport ship catching fire occurred on the Xiang River surface of Wan'an Lane, Hankou City at 4:00 a.m. on the 27th. The Wanxing ship, which was heading to Caidian, sold more than 700 passenger tickets. While it was being loaded with rice and waiting to depart, it suddenly caught fire.

<h3>British Advisor to the Ministry of Food, Huth, Arrives in Nanjing to Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Huth, the advisor to the Ministry of Food, has arrived in Nanjing from England. After meeting with Minister Yu on the 26th, he began working on the 27th. He told reporters that his task is to assist in the establishment of China's food distribution system. However, since he has just arrived in China, he must extensively exchange views with our experts and responsible officials before he can make any suggestions. Mr. Huth said that England is a food-importing country, while China is a food-producing country. The British rationing system cannot be applied to China and a different plan must be made. He believes that the rationing system is not enough to learn from. If a country has abundant food, it is not necessary. If it is just enough to eat, the rationing system can be effective. He will conduct research on the handling of China's food problems in the short term.</p>

<h3>Postponement of Bond Offsetting for Bank and Money Shop Deposit Reserve; Full Cash Payment to Implement Financial Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Regarding the issue of banks and money shops using bonds to offset the deposit reserve, the authorities have recently decided to postpone its implementation. Banks and money shops should still pay all deposit reserves in cash. This is a statement from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that after the promulgation and implementation of the Banking Law, the Ministry of Finance, with reference to the financial situation, approved that banks and money shops could use government bonds and treasury bills to offset this reserve at the approved price standard, but it should not exceed 50% of the total amount payable, and it was stipulated that it would be implemented from January 1, 1948. However, now is the time to strengthen financial control and tighten credit, and the above-mentioned offsetting with bonds has to be reconsidered. The decision has been made to postpone the original plan that deposit reserves could be offset with bonds from January 1st next year. The deposit reserves payable by each bank and money shop should still be paid in full cash to implement the policy of strengthening financial control.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Clarify Its Policy Towards Japan; Decisions Possible During the Next Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the year comes to an end, Washington predicts that a comprehensive change in U.S. policy toward Japan may occur, the main reason being the recent failure of the four-power foreign ministers meeting in London. Members of Congress believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with Britain, France, and the United States in Europe has provided the United States with a solid basis for reviewing its Pacific policy. The main issue in the minds of the American people this year regarding Japan is when to sign a peace treaty with Japan. The majority of people inside and outside the government believe that the time is near, and the Japanese issue will receive more attention in January when Congress reconvenes. According to most members of Congress, the U.S. occupation policy toward Japan will also be reviewed by Congress again. Members of Congress and the business community are now increasingly criticizing the economic and social reforms implemented in Japan as being contrary to the interests of Britain and the United States and inconsistent with democratic principles. At the same time, American public opinion unanimously supports Congress in seeking to clarify the Japanese issue.</p>
<h3>The Washington Post Emphasizes the Amount of U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] According to today's Washington Post, the amount of U.S. aid to China has reached $1.398 billion since the Japanese surrender. The Post published today statistics on U.S. financial aid to China and followed the general opinion of the State Department, emphasizing the so-called "extremely large" economic aid to China in response to those who criticize the United States for ignoring Chairman Chiang. The amount published by the newspaper is based on "new official figures," which is $70,000 more than the one published by the President's Economic Advisory Committee in October. The State Department is now responding to the request made during the recent debate by the Senate Appropriations Committee to revise the information on temporary aid to China in detail. The State Department does not comment on the Post's news before this work is completed. The Post has always strived to advocate aid to Europe. It is said that the above-mentioned figures include the U.S. aid to China under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) program, but it failed to explain the "full facts" of U.S. aid to China after the Japanese surrender. The newspaper continued to say that figures alone are not enough to explain how the United States equipped 39 divisions for Chairman Chiang and carried out the great plan to train the Chinese Navy in Qingdao. In order to emphasize the large amount of U.S. aid to China, the newspaper also said that 271 U.S. Navy ships have now been transferred to China, but the Post did not point out that between July 1, 1945, and June 30, 1947, U.S. aid in funds, materials, and credit loans to China only accounted for 2.5% of the total, while Britain accounted for 48.6% and France accounted for 20.9%. The military aid included in the Post's report includes the $728 million under the military lend-lease program, the $49 million oil pipeline credit loan under the civilian lend-lease program, the $83 million credit loan approved by the Export-Import Bank, the $468 million U.S. aid to China under the UNRRA relief program, the $40 million credit loan for purchasing surplus materials, and the $30 million relief expenses after the end of UNRRA, totaling $1.398 billion. However, officials of the Foreign Surplus Materials Liquidation Committee were unable to verify the above-mentioned $40 million credit loan for surplus materials.</p>

<h3>From Emphasis on Education to Silk Weaving Education</h3>
<p>— Wang Mengfan</p>
<p>Although the current emphasis in China is not on the textile industry, the "clothing" of the nation's 450 million people cannot be separated from the support of the textile industry. Therefore, developing the textile industry is, in the process of nation-building, a matter of utmost urgency. Moreover, our nation's textile industry has always been backward, making it even more imperative to catch up quickly. However, the key to developing the textile industry lies not in adding more textile machines or increasing the supply of raw cotton, but in cultivating textile talent. Nantong College is the only textile school in the country. Amidst the various discussions on "striving for academic independence" and "emphasis on education," their approach to managing textile education seems to warrant discussion.</p>
<p>Nantong College is located in Nantong, Jiangsu, representing the coastal area of the Jianghuai Delta. The greatest need of this coastal area is land reclamation. The primary crop for reclamation is cotton. Nantong College has a long history and made significant contributions to cotton research. In the future, they can further seize this advantage and engage in substantive development. All kinds of research facilities related to cotton cultivation can form a system and be nurtured, so that areas with the same natural conditions as this region in China and around the world can use Nantong College's cotton research as a reference. However, in addition to its own research, the cotton cultivation department is closely related to various fields such as insects, soil, fertilizer, meteorology, agricultural implements, cotton production, as well as surveying, water conservancy, rural cooperation, and farm management related to land reclamation. Based on this alone, it is sufficient to become a college.</p>
<p>As for textile manufacturing, it is a continuation of cotton cultivation. Nantong College is the first textile school in China, with a glorious record in the history of Chinese textile education. Mr. Zhang Jian's cotton-based policy, advocated for local development, was aimed at connecting cotton cultivation and textile manufacturing. However, if Nantong College wants to make textile manufacturing its focus in education, it should pay attention to the following issues:</p>
<p>Increasing the number of spindles and looms; Improving the vast majority of hand-spinning, home textile manufacturing, and machine textile manufacturing; Self-sufficiency in textile machinery; Coordination between cotton-producing areas and cotton textile manufacturing nationwide, and the development of the national economy; The market for textile products. These issues are related to various applied sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. If all of these can form a system and be enriched, it can certainly become a separate university and more.</p>
<p>However, some also say: To strive for an independent academic field, one should not dissect it too finely, extracting a branch from a department (such as cotton reclamation) or singling out a small category from applied departments (such as textile manufacturing) as a base for striving for academic independence. While this view may seem reasonable, we must pay attention to the fact that in striving for academic independence to achieve national independence, we must also pay attention to the rapid conditions for catching up in the midst of slow academic research. Under this "realistic" and "quick-acting" demand, it should be necessary to specifically extract a small, single application scope in the academic field and make it the center. Therefore, we want to target the Jianghuai coastal area that needs cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, with Nantong College as the center of research, experimentation, and promotion of cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, and further become one of the cotton cultivation and textile centers for the whole country and the world.</p>
<p>To fully realize this vision, equipment and talent are certainly needed. Regarding equipment, the government, the school itself, and the society should concentrate their efforts to enrich it. This base for striving for national academic independence should represent the entire nation. The government should not distinguish between public and private, and should fully support it at all times, collecting as much important equipment from around the world as possible and placing it all in one place to enrich it. Within the school, although each department should continue to be managed, priority should be given to those related to cotton cultivation and textile manufacturing in enriching equipment. This period should be set for at least five or ten years, and after it is generally enriched and has first-class conditions, a plan for the next step should be formulated. Regarding talent: including world-class scholars with research on cotton and textile manufacturing, entrepreneurs in cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, experts with insights into cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, researchers who have received basic training and are eager to pursue further studies, and teachers who are responsible for basic training. These talents should all take research, experimentation, and promotion of cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing as their lifelong career, and their compensation must be increased so that it will be able to attract specialized talent from home and abroad.</p>
<p>In summary, from the emphasis on education to cotton reclamation and textile education, the focus of Nantong College is not only to add departments and complete the university, but also to seek the emphasis to establish an academic center. Although this piecemeal approach may be considered unfair to departments other than cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, most of the past and present departments of Nantong College are somewhat related to cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing. Even the medical department, in the initial intention of the founding president Mr. Zhang Jian, was in response to the natural needs of the region after the development of agricultural reclamation and industry, and was still developed in coordination with reclamation and textile manufacturing. Therefore, the movement to transform Nantong College into a university, observed from this perspective, deserves the support of the government and society.</p>

<p>Draft Organization of the Presidential Office</p>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Wang Jun advocated that the Director of the General Office be similar to the Vice President, which should not be established. Sun, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, said that last year, the National Assembly discussed in detail Chapter 4 of the Constitution regarding the position and powers of the President. Some advocated the American system, while others advocated the French system. The American President is equivalent to the head of state and also the head of government, having two qualifications. Although the White House organization has gradually become complex after World War II, its content is still simple, with only a secretary. President Roosevelt established the Chief of Staff of the Army and Navy, but there was no military affairs office. The civilian office had only an adjutant to follow. The French President is equivalent to the head of state, only issuing orders but not executing them. According to Articles 35 to 44 of Chapter 4 of our Constitution, the President is completely the head of state, equivalent to the President of a responsible cabinet, while the head of government is the Premier of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan manages political affairs, and the Ministry of National Defense manages military affairs. The President does not directly issue orders but must pass through the regular government agencies. From this perspective, the system of the Presidential Office should be simple, even simpler than the American system. President Sun also pointed out that the secretaries under the American President are not ministers. Our country's translation of the American Secretary of State has been traditionally translated as "Guowu Qing," which is a feudal idea and a mistake. The American Secretary of State has two tasks: coordination between the central government and the states, and the United States' foreign affairs. Recently, since all state associations have been established, the special party is responsible for foreign affairs. President Sun advocated that the organization of our Presidential Office should not directly manage political affairs, otherwise it would become two governments, and the powers would not be clear, inevitably leading to disputes between the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan. All matters, large and small, should be under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Moreover, the political advisors in the Presidential Office inevitably have the suspicion of participating in and interfering with politics. The original draft lacked consideration. The case was handed over to the Constitutional and Regulatory Committee for re-examination, and it is not necessary to use it as a blueprint. It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of January or early February and submitted to the next general meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Hebei Refugees Petition the Chairman</p>
<p>Requesting Troops to Suppress the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Several thousand refugee families from Beima Fang Town, Zhanggezhuang, and Yukou Town in Sanhe County, Hebei Province, led by Guo Wei and others, recently petitioned the Chairman: The people have mostly made a living by farming. Since March of this year, thousands of Communist bandits suddenly came and occupied the villages of Beima Fang Town, Zhanggezhuang, and Yukou Town where the people lived. They drafted able-bodied men from thousands of families into the bandit ranks to fight, and drafted young women into labor teams to work. The elderly were forced to farm and plant cotton, handing over rent, shoes, and socks. Assets and food were transported away for public use. After the autumn harvest in August, the bandits forced the harvesting of crops and transported them away. They also carried out large-scale class struggles. All slightly wealthy families were robbed clean, and the old and young were taken away. They gathered people to announce crimes, or executed or imprisoned them, suffering inhuman torture. The people could not bear the abuse and have now agreed to flee to Peiping. Now parents, wives, sisters, and brothers are all in the hands of the bandits. They beg the Chairman for great compassion, and beg the Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, together with local teams, to suppress and recover the lost territory. Please do not continue to ignore us, and rescue the people's lives. It would be the greatest gratitude.</p>
<p>Communist Bandits Disregard Refugees</p>
<p>Misappropriate Relief Supplies</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 27th] According to the confession of Chang, the instructor of the Communist bandit Xihua County team: The Communist bandits flowing in the Huang Pan area, because of the lack of products and the difficulty of living in the area, transferred the rice, noodles, and other food they received as relief to military use, and did not distribute them to the refugees. According to our army's inspection of the cotton quilts of the Communist bandit officers and soldiers seized in the Ma (north of Xihua) battle, all were made of cloth distributed by the relief agencies to relieve refugees. Recently, after the Communist bandits captured Xuchang, they forced the relief agencies. All these actions disregard the lives of the compatriots in distress and misappropriate relief supplies to be used as tools for rebellion, which is the most inhumane and despicable behavior.</p>
<p>Communist Bandits Disrupt River Works</p>
<p>Arson, Murder and Looting Become More Fierce</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] According to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Huanghe Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau telegraphed: Communist bandits harass the dikes, engaging in arson, murder, and looting wherever they go, and are more ferocious than before. Recently, they went to Huanggu and conducted a large-scale search. Pan, a soldier of the engineering team, and Tian Jintang were captured. The remaining employees fled to the Gao Village construction site. The housing in Huosai was also set on fire. The whereabouts of the employees in Pandi are still unknown. Since the beginning of the engineering period this year, the Communist bandits have constantly harassed our construction site. Squad members and soldiers have been captured and injured. Although it is now early winter and the engineering period has passed, the large flow is still above Liuzhuang Gao Village and has not moved outward. The farmland outside the dikes is still lower than the water surface inside, and the situation is still urgent. Employees have always risked lurking at the construction site, adding repairs and guarding, and dare not leave for a moment. Recently, the Communist bandits have threatened that they will kill any river workers captured in the future and will never forgive them, hoping to destroy the dikes and cause a catastrophe. It is reported that the ministry, after receiving the report, has ordered strict precautions to be taken and the defense to be strengthened.</p>

<h3>Chairman Cables Sichuan Province to Recover Grain Arrears Over the Years</h3>
<p>Provincial Government and Others Form a Grain Clearance Committee</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 27th] Because the Central government has determined that the amount of grain owed in Sichuan Province for many years exceeds ten million piculs, and has not been collected clearly, the Sichuan Provincial Government received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the 27th, stating that the grain owed in Sichuan Province is mostly owed due to embezzlement by local gentry and those in charge.

<h3>Britain Reviews Foreign Policy Bevin Plans to Submit Draft to Cabinet</h3>
<p>British and American Cooperation Needed to Curb Soviet Influence</p>
<p>[United Press, London, December 26th] Britain may take initial practical steps next week to abandon its role as a post-war world mediator and partner with the United States to contain the Soviet Union. The British Cabinet is scheduled to hold a plenary session next Monday to discuss a provisional draft of British foreign policy, prepared by Foreign Secretary Bevin after the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Government officials do not want to underestimate the importance of this Cabinet decision, privately stating that the resolution includes not only policy issues related to Germany but also all areas related to the economic and ideological conflict between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Although saddened by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's accusations of British imperialism, Bevin reportedly does not want to implement a showdown to avoid an indefinite end to the Four Powers consultations. Before the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, British Foreign Office spokesmen repeatedly reiterated their belief that East-West disputes could be resolved through compromise. Even after the conference ended, Bevin was unwilling to participate in the Marshall Plan to prevent the Soviet Union from removing German factories. Since then, several factors have changed the situation, which have helped Bevin's decision-making and expanded Cabinet support for U.S. policy. The main factor is President Truman's aid plan for Europe submitted to Congress. Another factor is Britain's anger at the Soviet Union's intensified anti-American movement in Greece and the Middle East. Other factors include the establishment of a Greek communist government, which may receive open support from countries under Soviet influence.</p>
<p>The memorandum submitted by Bevin to the Cabinet is strictly confidential, but it generally consists of: (1) finding ways to invite France to participate in British and American economic cooperation in West Germany; (2) the potential crisis caused by the expansion of political control in the Western occupation zones; (3) taking various steps to increase Britain's position among Arab countries through alliance treaties; and (4) the goals of Britain and the Commonwealth once the peace treaty with Japan is drafted.</p>
<h3>Former Secretary of State Welles Writes Extensively on US Policy Toward the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Makes Seven Major Mistakes on World Issues</p>
<p>[Our News] New York, December 27th Broadcast: Former US Secretary of State Welles wrote an article elaborating on the expectations of the United States, claiming that the Soviet Union has decided to adopt an aggressive policy of expansion. If the Soviet Union is allowed to control Europe, the Near East, and the Far East, the security of the American people will be threatened. He pointed out that the United States has committed seven major "mistakes" in post-war world politics: (1) The United States failed to prevent the Chinese civil war, which is currently destroying China and ultimately may cause a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union over interests in the Far East; (2) Before victory, the United States failed to persuade the Allies to reach an agreement on peace issues, especially on the German issue; (3) Failure to use the Lend-Lease Act and military advantages to make the Allies abide by the Atlantic Charter; (4) Failure to agree on a post-war economic recovery plan before victory in Europe; (5) Applying political and economic pressure to other countries in the Western Hemisphere; (6) Failure to consult with France on the German issue; (7) Failure to recognize the great importance of democratic Italy to the American people in a timely manner.</p>

Laval is no different from Quisling; Petain ultimately became senile after being a good soldier for a while; Stilwell is the greatest American soldier, whose mission in the China-India-Burma theater surpassed all American military figures. Stimson believes that the capture of Myitkyina was a great battle that was not fully appreciated. As for Marshall, he is the best soldier he has ever seen in his life.</p>

<h3>Truman Authorizes Marshall to Implement Emergency Aid to Europe A Long-Term Aid to China Plan is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, December 26th] President Truman issued an order on the 26th authorizing Secretary of State Marshall to supervise the implementation of the $522.2 million emergency aid program to France, Italy, and Austria. It is reported that the US Congress has also approved $18 million in aid to China, but the details of the program have not yet been drafted, and the amount is not included in the scope authorized by Truman to the State Department. Truman's order authorized Marshall to perform duties in the name of the President when implementing the foreign aid bill, and to have the authority to instruct other government agencies to participate in the assistance.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Washington, December 26th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said: Among the $540 million in the US emergency aid to Europe fund, an immediate advance of $150 million is now being planned, and a relief fund for China is also being drafted to be included in the long-term world economic recovery relief bill. China will be allocated another relief fund, which will be implemented in the same way as in Europe under the conditions of the termination of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration agreement, because the new appropriation has been expressed for the same goal, that is, relief rather than long-term recovery.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Organized in a Unified Manner</h3>
<p>The Problem of Genuine and Fake Refugees is Serious and Should be Paid Attention To</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Holds Tea Party to Entertain the Press Offers Three Questions to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu, for the sake of winter relief matters, invited responsible persons from the city's press to a discussion meeting in the city government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Zhao Junhao, Zhao Minheng, Luo Dunwei, Wang Yunsheng, Tang Zengyi, Hu Chuanhou, Cheng Wangxi, and Fang Zhichao. The mayor first reported on the progress of the relief efforts, saying: According to the city government's investigation, the total number of refugees in the city is approximately 300,000, of which approximately 50,000 are in real need of relief for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. After the launch of the winter relief donation campaign, it was met with enthusiastic response from all walks of life, with satisfactory results, and the total of 60 billion has reached the target. However, three issues have arisen in the fundraising and refugee reception and handling aspects, and it is planned to ask people in the press to assist with instructions: Fundraising issues: After the launch of the winter relief fundraising campaign, all sectors were motivated by justice and compassion and actively donated, with considerable results. However, the municipal authorities, due to the lack of a unified organization for handling donations and a unified distribution method, are afraid that malpractices will inevitably occur, which should be carefully discussed. Refugee handling issues: According to the city government's analysis of the sources of refugees, the city's refugees can be divided into three categories: one is from war zones such as northern Jiangsu and Anhui, the second is the inherent vagrants and beggars of Shanghai, and the third is scalpers, pickpockets, and petty thieves. On the city government's side, it is planned to implement a work-for-relief method for those refugees who are strong and able to work, ordering them to dredge rivers and providing them with wages of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per day. After the winter, they can obtain travel expenses to return to their hometowns, or they can use it as capital for small businesses. As for the elderly, weak, women, and children among the refugees, shelters will be built to house and care for them. The most difficult to deal with are the scalpers, beggars, and petty thieves, because if they are not taken in, it will have a direct impact on social security and order. If they are given work relief, it is feared that good people will be assimilated by them. According to the city government's original intention, it is planned to house them in vocational training centers, separated from the refugees. Regarding the improvement of reception techniques: According to the city government's investigation results, it was found that a part of the refugees are fake. They have broken into various funeral parlors without authorization and often gather to request relief everywhere. The authorities planned to move them into shelters, but they were refused. Their reason is that "Although they can get warmth after entering the shelter, they lose their freedom." The occurrence of this situation is extremely serious and it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it. It is also hoped that the press can provide opinions to improve it and become a model for future relief work.</p>
<h3>Reporters Express Opinions</h3>
<p>After the Mayor's speech, Wang Yunsheng, Luo Dunwei, Fang Zhichao and others successively expressed their opinions, generally believing that the citizens are currently enthusiastic about providing relief to refugees, and the authorities must not arbitrarily suppress them. Although a unified method for handling donations is feasible, its effectiveness should be strengthened. "Relief is like fighting a fire," and it should not be delayed due to official procedures.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu summarized the opinions from the meeting as follows: The winter relief donation will be handled in a unified manner by the Winter Relief Committee. The person in charge of any newly established donation organization should immediately contact the Winter Relief Committee on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to receive an official receipt booklet and then solicit donations from the outside world. Any citizen who has a donation receipt will be exempted from donating a second time. Regarding the solicitation of winter clothing, the Winter Relief Committee should also be contacted first, and the committee will discuss with the neighborhood and village leaders in each district to designate areas and distribute winter clothing to avoid the ills of bias and duplication. Regarding refugee handling, it is planned to invite representatives from various charitable organizations such as churches and temples in the city to assist in management. It is also hoped that various newspapers can regularly send reporters to inspect the various shelters and provide opinions and suggestions for improvement as much as possible.</p>
<h3>People's Food Allocation Committee Decides to Reorganize and Expand; Rice Allocation Limited to Employees Paid According to Index</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee held its ninth meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Director Wu, narrowing the scope to approve 18 entities, including the Workers' Welfare Committee. The method for allocating rice to vocational workers was revised to add the following: "The target of rice allocation is limited to employees who are paid according to the cost of living index and who possess a national identification card," in addition to the original regulations. The application for December rice allocation will close at the end of the month. All rice allocation matters for this year will be completed before January 15th of next year. The price for the second phase of oil distribution per capita will be determined at a price negotiation meeting scheduled for the 29th. In the first phase of oil distribution per capita, there was a distinction between large and small rations, with large rations being one pound and small rations being half a pound. However, there was no survey of large and small rations in each district. Therefore, until the household registration authorities have accurate statistics on large and small rations, starting from the second phase, each person will receive twelve ounces per month, regardless of size. This method will be implemented after approval from the municipal government. The approval of 5,000 dan of rice for the Winter Relief Committee was passed.</p>
<h3>Participation Jointly by Various Agencies</h3>
<p>According to Director Wu of the committee, who told reporters: the current organization of the People's Food Allocation Committee is not sound enough, and all problems are impossible to discuss. Rice is managed by the Ministry of Food, coal is managed by the Fuel Management Committee, and oil is the responsibility of the China Trust Bureau. However, the key officials of the Allocation Committee are concurrently appointed by the Social Affairs Bureau, which affects both sides of the work. Next year's work will focus on comprehensive distribution, which concerns five million citizens throughout the city, so it is essential to strengthen the organization. He has decided to resign from this concurrent position. The Economic Reporting Conference and this regular meeting of the Allocation Committee have both approved the reorganization of the People's Food Allocation Committee, requesting the Central Government to send personnel to take charge. Units such as the Central Bank, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Fuel Management Committee, the China Trust Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, and the Police Department will participate.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Retains Tao Yishan</h3>

<h3>Improving the Nutrition of Soldiers; New Year's Visit to Honored Veterans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Committee for Comforting Soldiers on Expeditions held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Mayor Wu, with over twenty attendees including Xie Renzhao, Chuan Zhengmo, Zhang Wei, and Li Ximou.

Weapons and ammunition will be allocated by the Ministry of National Defense. As for its expenses, following the precedents of the establishment of garrison forces in Hankou and Taiwan, the local government should raise and bear the expenses. It is estimated that the monthly recurring expenses alone will require 20 billion yuan. The municipal government is currently studying this. It is said that once the funding is secured, the brigade can be established.</p>
<h3>Movie Theaters Automatically Raise Prices; Wu Kaixian Says, Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday: the matter of raising movie ticket prices is still under consideration, and it is unlikely to be implemented starting on New Year's Day, as the procedures are not yet complete. As for the statement that movie theater operators have decided to "automatically adjust" ticket prices, it is quite problematic. The Finance Bureau must wait until it receives the Social Affairs Bureau's notice of approved price increases before stamping the entertainment tax seal on the movie tickets. The Social Affairs Bureau's desire to inspect movie theater accounts is not because it suspects them of tax evasion or corruption, but because the reason given by the movie theaters for raising prices is insufficient expenditure. The Social Affairs Bureau wants to understand whether this is indeed the case.</p>
<h3>Council Resolution: Ban the Sale of Lysol</h3>

<h3>No Evidence of Abetting Suicide; Zhang Chunfan Declared Not Guilty; Smiles and Deep Bow After Hearing the Verdict</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the sensational case of Yue opera actress Xiao Dangui's suicide by taking Lysol, Zhang Chunfan, manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was accused of abetting suicide. After being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office, the case was tried twice by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court, and has now concluded. After Judge Mei Erhe ascended to the Criminal Division No. 8 yesterday morning, Zhang Chunfan was brought forward. Zhang wore a Melton woolen coat, a peaked cap, and felt shoes. After confirming his name and origin, Judge Mei stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhang Chunfan is not guilty." After the verdict was announced, the reasons were explained. At that time, Zhang smiled after hearing the verdict and bowed deeply to express his gratitude. Zhang's lawyer requested permission for bail, which was granted by the court, ordering Zhang to provide security from two shops, with the security amount being 30 million National Currency. Zhang then left the court. Zhang found security from the Hongchang and Risheng silk shops in the afternoon and was released on bail. The reasons for the verdict of not guilty are briefly stated as follows: The accusation in the indictment that Qian Chunyun said "If you are not feeling well, you can die" during an argument with the defendant was used as a basis for the defendant's prior knowledge of the suicide. The defendant claimed that he had not heard this, and even if it were true, it was nothing more than a rash statement made by Qian during the argument, and it was several days before the suicide. It is difficult to determine from this that the defendant instigated her suicide. Qian's suicide was sudden and unexpected by the defendant. Since the defendant could not foresee the occurrence of the result, he was unable to prevent it, so he should not be held liable for the crimes under Article 15 and Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. It is clear. Then, what was the cause of Qian's suicide? A comprehensive review of the circumstances of the entire case reveals that Qian repeatedly expressed remorse to the defendant after the incident, hoping to rekindle their old relationship in order to make up for the emotional rift between them. However, the defendant regarded her with indifference, and her melancholy had not dissipated for several days. Moreover, Qian repeatedly planned to go to Hangzhou together to relieve her sorrow, but was unable to do so due to obstacles. On the 13th of the same month, Qian was dressed and ready to depart when she was rejected by the defendant, which led to her feeling of world-weariness. Although the defendant's excessive criticism of others is open to question in terms of morality and justice towards the deceased Qian, after investigation, there is no definite evidence of abetting suicide, and a verdict of not guilty should be announced in accordance with the law. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made as stated in the main text in accordance with Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

In addition, the committee has made 10,000 sets of cotton clothing, which have been manufactured.

<h3>Procurement of Goods; Defrauded in Taiwan; Sun Zhidao Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Zhidao, 35 years old, a local resident, was arrested for fraud. The victims, Wang Liansheng, Chen Qigeng, and others, accused Sun and his brother Zhixin of jointly defrauding them of 200 million legal tender. It is reported that Wang Liansheng is 52 years old, from Danyang, and lives at 346 Jiangxi Road. Chen Qigeng is 49 years old, from Ningbo, and resides at 20 Shenyuli, Fusheng Road. Both of the above are engaged in the paper box factory business. On the 4th of this month, they went to Taiwan with their friend Ma Hongjin to purchase paperboard. Because they were unfamiliar with the area, they were introduced to the Sun brothers by Ma. On the 12th, they entrusted Sun to introduce them to the Datong Paper Factory in Taipei to order 500 reams of paperboard, stating that each ream would cost 17,000 Taiwan dollars, totaling 8.5 million Taiwan dollars, worth 700 million National Currency. A deposit of 2.4 million Taiwan dollars, worth 200 million National Currency, was required on the spot. Because Wang and others lacked cash, Sun issued a check dated the 15th from the Trust Department of the Taiwan China Southern Bank, with a face value of 2.4 million yuan. Wang et al. then telegraphed the factory in Shanghai for consultation and wrote a note to Huang of the Changxing Public Customs Branch on Xiaoer Road, Keelung, to forward it to Shanghai and instruct them to quickly remit the funds to Taiwan to pay the debt. On the 15th, Wang et al. returned to Shanghai. The funds were remitted to Taiwan on the 17th, but the check issued on the 15th had already been returned. On the 17th, Sun went to Changxing Public Customs and received 2.4 million Taiwan dollars from Cai Zengyu, an employee. Because Cai had dealings with Sun in the past, he did not issue a receipt. After receiving the money, Sun avoided meeting them from then on. On the 20th, he left Taiwan by ship. After arriving in Shanghai on the 23rd, he settled in his concubine's residence on Huanghe Road. Later, the Datong Paper Factory in Taiwan discovered the returned check and found that the remittance had also been claimed. Realizing that something was wrong, they reported it to the Port Police Bureau for record. At the same time, Ma Hongjin telegraphed Shanghai, informing Wang and Chen, who searched for Sun in Shanghai without success. They then reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau. Section Chief Xu ordered officers Jiang Dafu, employee Ma Jiaju, and police officer Liu Shizhu to Sun's residence on Beikongjia Lane in Nanshi, but they could not be arrested. His younger brother Zhixin then voluntarily surrendered, claiming that it had nothing to do with him. After investigation, it was confirmed that he was innocent and released. Zhixin revealed that his brother Sun Zhidao was hiding in his concubine's residence at 25 Chengxingli, Huanghe Road after returning to Shanghai. The police were dispatched and finally arrested him and brought him to justice. Sun confessed to the fraud. Although Sun had engaged in business between Shanghai and Taiwan, he had no fixed occupation and was fond of gambling, with heavy debts. After defrauding the huge sum of money, he used it all to pay off old debts and gamble. After the sub-bureau completed the investigation, it scheduled to send the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gang Police Beaten on Shanyin Road; Wu District Procuratorate Concludes Investigation; Four Law College Students Not Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 27th] Li Shuxi, Pan Cai, Lin Ziqiu, Gu [illegible]ji and four other students from Shanghai Jiangwan Road Law College participated in the Shanghai student propaganda movement on May 4th of this year. At noon that day, they and more than 100 other students were pasting slogans in front of the Freedom Publishing House at the intersection of Shanyin Road at the end of North Sichuan Road, when they were obstructed by Guo Juxiang, a police officer on duty at that location, resulting in a conflict. The students became agitated and surrounded and beat Guo, injuring him. Li Shuxi and the other four students, because they lingered and did not leave, were sent to the Shanghai High Procuratorate by the Municipal Police Bureau on suspicion of obstructing official duties and assault. The Supreme Court Procuratorate then ordered that they be transferred to the Wu County District Procuratorate for investigation. It is reported that the investigation of the case has now concluded. Based on the police bureau's records at the time of the incident and the testimony of other witnesses at the scene, it could not be determined that the four students had actually participated in the assault, so they were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of a crime.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Dou Shi Street; One Bandit Intercepted</h3>

The Chamber of Commerce believes that since the city's profit tax is processed according to the standard tax system, industries with determined tax standards, excluding those already audited, should uniformly follow the standard tax without further case-by-case audits. They have sent a letter to the Tax Bureau requesting correction, which has been forwarded to the ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Harsh Measures Fail; Soft Tactics Achieve Results: Hong Kong Governor Secretly Arrives in Guangzhou to Seek a "Compromise" for the Demolition Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Telegram, 24th] The Guangzhou public has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the Kowloon Walled City incident, urging the Hong Kong government to respect China's sovereignty and not to add another unpleasant page to Sino-British relations amidst China's domestic and foreign troubles. The Hong Kong government recently seemed to have deeply understood the situation. After Guangdong-Guangxi Special Commissioner Guo Dehua brought back new instructions from Nanjing, and after repeated negotiations with the Hong Kong government, the attitude of the Hong Kong government seemed to have begun to change. A few days ago, Hong Kong's Chinese and Western newspapers published a headline announcing that Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham had taken a weekend trip, but the destination could not be announced. While speculations were rampant in Hong Kong, the Governor quietly ran to Guangzhou to secretly discuss solutions to the Kowloon Walled City incident with Director Song. This information was obtained by a reporter from reliable sources and is highly credible. But why does the Governor have to take such a "secret" trip? According to qualified sources familiar with the style of British people in Hong Kong: British gentlemen never admit mistakes, they just try to evade and find a compromise. This time, the Kowloon Magistracy issued summons to residents of the Kowloon Walled City in a very serious manner. On the day of the trial, not a single resident appeared in court (because they are not subject to British law). The judge probably fainted for a moment and issued a "demolition order." How does the Hong Kong government have the right to demolish civilian houses on the land of the Republic of China? But laws cannot be reversed, and the people of Kowloon Walled City will not give up their houses to others for demolition, especially since this is a diplomatic issue and has nothing to do with the civil law of the Kowloon Magistracy! However, the Hong Kong government recklessly did this simply to "scare" the residents. If the residents were intimidated by its stern demeanor and ran to submit to British law, then things would be much easier. Now that harsh measures have failed, it has to resort to soft tactics. The Governor does not hesitate to run to Guangzhou to meet Director Song to discuss a "compromise" so that the gentleman can step down gracefully. It is said that Director Song has determined that diplomatic negotiations are possible, but sovereignty cannot be lost. He is prepared to settle this fluctuating case with the Hong Kong government and, at the same time, inform the Baoan County government to promptly report the household registration of the Kowloon Walled City (estimated at 135 households, totaling 1687 people) to facilitate the negotiations.

<h3>Hainan Iron Ore Development Imminent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hainan Island Telegram, 25th] Hainan Island is rich in mineral deposits, which is well-known overseas. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan, they paid attention to developing the Shilu and Tiandu mines. After the war, the resumption of operations was not well-handled, resulting in production stagnation and failure to achieve large-scale development. It is now learned that to strengthen national power, the highest authorities have instructed the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee to formulate concrete plans for developing the iron ore in the southern part of the island and implement them step by step. More than 200 engineers and technicians have been dispatched, along with a large number of new mining tools, to Hainan by ship to carry out the mining work. It is also learned that Xiao Mohan, a specialist from the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee's Hainan Iron Ore Preparatory Office, has been assigned to Hainan to plan the mining steps.</p>
<h3>Hainan Pacification Command Headquarters to be Officially Established on New Year's Day; Zhang Beihai Appointed Chairman of Special Party Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hainan Island Telegram, 27th] In order to eliminate communist bandits in various places as soon as possible and consolidate public security, the Guangdong Provincial Government has specially divided the entire province into several pacification zones according to administrative divisions, responsible for pacification work. The commanders of the command headquarters in each zone are concurrently held by the commissioners of the respective zones, so as to achieve the effect of military-government unity. Hainan is the ninth administrative district and will also establish the Ninth District Pacification Command Headquarters. The establishment date has been set for New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Hainan Island has a unique geographical environment. The Central Standing Committee has previously approved the organization of the Hainan Special Party Department and appointed Zhang Beihai as the Chairman and Zheng Tianjian as the Secretary-General. Today, a reporter quoted a person in charge of party affairs here, saying: The island is isolated overseas, and due to traffic congestion, it is not easy for party departments in various counties to contact the provincial party department. In order to strengthen the progress of party affairs, a special party department is set up to supervise nearby. Furthermore, there was also a special party department in Hainan Island in the 15th year of the Republic of China. Chairman Zhang, a native of Huiyang, Guangdong, has been handling party affairs for many years and will come south within days. The Special Party Department will also be officially established.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Bank of China Accused of Lax Payment Inspection; 2 Million Yuan Check Altered to 30 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Suzhou Telegram, 26th] The Suzhou Bank of China has recently been sued by Yang Wenlian, former commander of the 29th Army Officers' Brigade of the Central Training Corps, and Kong Jiesheng, a quartermaster, for negligent payment inspection. It is said that the brigade had issued a check for retirement pay to a retired military officer with a face value of 1.09 million yuan. The payee altered it to 38 million yuan and cashed it at the Bank of China. The bank, in its haste, did not discern the alteration and rashly made the payment. It was not until the recent reconciliation that the error was discovered. The officers' brigade requested the Capital Police Headquarters to send technical personnel to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office to extract the check from the bank. It was confirmed that it had indeed been altered, leading to the lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Yu Zuogang Kills Someone, Implicating Wan Ruilin in Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuxi Telegram, 26th] During his tenure, former Xiang Xiang Mayor and Self-Defense Team Leader Yu Zuogang abused his power and illegally arrested Sun Jiadao, who sold eye medicine. He tortured him to death, moved the body to the wilderness. At the time, a razor seller witnessed this and informed the corpse's father, Sun Murong, who reported it to the District Prosecutor's Office. An autopsy confirmed that the death was caused by illegal torture. Knowing that things were not good, the criminal Yu fled with his weapon. Later, the security team learned of it and arrested Yu and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. After the investigation was concluded, he was prosecuted for murder and tried publicly by the Criminal Court. Yu stubbornly denied killing Sun Jiadao, only claiming that he happened to be on leave on the day Sun was killed. He presented the instruction of the former Zhang Jing District Chief You Ruilin approving his leave, stating that Yu was not there at the time. You himself also appeared in court and admitted that he had written the instruction himself, but it was not recorded in the receipt book. Judge Zhao Changnian believed that the testimony of witness You Ruilin was full of loopholes, that he had handled the instruction single-handedly, and that there was obvious suspicion of forgery. He also believed that You colluded with the criminal Yu and committed the crime of perjury. He ordered the two criminals, Yu and You, to be detained together for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Sanyang Class Massacre; The Main Criminal, Li A'mi, Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Pinghu Telegram, 25th] On December 30, 35th year of Republic, thirteen passengers and boatmen on the Sanyang Class speedboat were collectively murdered by bandits at the Bai Mao Port of the county. The incident shocked the southeastern provinces. After the county government offered a reward for the arrest of the wanted criminal Li A'mi and others for half a year, five people were arrested. After several interrogations by the local court, Li A'mi, Qian A'kui, and Zhu Jingen all confessed. The verdict was announced on the 25th of this month: Li A'mi was sentenced to death for continuous murder. The two bandits, Qian and Li, were jointly guilty of murder, but because the crime was committed before the amnesty period, they were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. The two bandits, Wang A'shui and Lu A'qi, only admitted to committing crimes in Jinshan County and will be transferred to Jinshan for trial.</p>
<h3>Wu Xing Notorious Bandit Wu Shunfa Surrenders, Attempts to Escape, Shot Dead</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wu Xing Telegram, 25th] Wu Shunfa, a notorious bandit in this county, was being closely pursued by the public security authorities and had nowhere to escape. He took two wooden guns and surrendered to the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Police Bureau, requesting shelter. Because the bandit had committed numerous crimes, he was ordered to be detained and was transferred to the Tianyue District Pacification Command Headquarters for interrogation on the 24th. The bandit attempted to escape en route and seized the machine gun of the escorting soldiers. The soldiers fired the machine gun, and the bandit was shot dead. After returning to the lake, a request was made to the District Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to examine the body and prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang's Largest Department Store, Xinxin Hosiery Factory, Broken Glass Windows; Six Major Perpetrators Have Been Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Telegram, 27th] The Xinxin Hosiery Factory on Daxi Road in Zhenjiang is the largest department store in Zhenjiang. Recently, due to excessive inventory, the shortage of funds reached nearly 1.6 billion. The chairman of the industry association was asked to borrow 400 million yuan from the Zhenjiang Syndicate, but it was still not enough. Therefore, they had no choice but to sell some of the inventory back to Shanghai for cash and to promote discounts in order to obtain more cash to get through the New Year. Unexpectedly, this move was resented by other merchants. At about 6 PM this afternoon, people in the same industry suddenly gathered and smashed several large glass windows in front of the store door. Fortunately, the police station in charge sent police to suppress the incident and arrested 28 perpetrators on the spot, took them to the station for questioning, and then released 22 on bail. The remaining six people, including Li Hanqing, were detained for further investigation due to their violent behavior. After the incident, the store immediately tightened the iron doors. It is said that it will continue to operate at reduced prices tomorrow and wait for the Chamber of Commerce to mediate.</p>

<h3>Trip to Southwestern Shandong: Yuncheng, Jining</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jinan Telegram, 24th] Southwestern Shandong has always been a gathering place for "heroes" in Chinese history. The people are strong, martial, and value righteousness. The Liangshan Marsh in "Water Margin" is located in the northeastern part of Yuncheng and in the middle of the Yellow River Canal area. The circumference of the mountain is more than ten miles, and there are many caves in the middle, making it easy to hide. There are three main villages in the mountain, each with more than two hundred households. There is a small adobe house with three rooms, which is said to be the site of the "Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness." Every summer and autumn, the river water rises sharply, and the mountain is surrounded by water. In winter, the water recedes, and the bottom of the river dries up, becoming a piece of yellow sand. According to a person from Yuncheng whom I met on this trip, even during peacetime, Liangshan was a place where "heroes" roamed, and those who had no contact with bandits dared not enter. To this day, Yuncheng still has two sites of the Wulong Courtyard: one is in the southwest corner of the city, which is a puddle; one is two miles south of the city, which is a pile of dirt. It is no longer possible to verify which one is the place where Song Jiang killed Yan Xijiao. However, the people of Yuncheng generally express their displeasure when you mention the Wulong Courtyard, just like calling an old-fashioned Shandong native "Big Brother." Both Yuncheng and Liangshan are still occupied by communist bandits. Yuncheng has fallen nine times.</p>
<p>Jining is located on the bank of the Grand Canal and was originally the economic center of southwestern Shandong. In the past, all the wheat, leather, and other products produced in southwestern Shandong were collected here. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway also built a branch line from here to connect with Yanzhou, so commerce was prosperous, and its importance far exceeded that of Chazhou and above. There is the "Taibai Tower" on the south gate tower, with statues of He Zhizhang and Li Taibai. Since the Song and Ming Dynasties, many famous people have inscribed on it. The "Brush Washing Spring" outside the east gate of the city is also a famous scenic spot. The richest man in the city is Sun Yutang Sauce Garden. The garden was founded in the Ming Dynasty and has lasted for four or five hundred years. It produced a champion in the imperial examination during the Qing Dynasty. It still owns 8,000 large sauce jars, all of which are covered with silk. When the communist bandits besieged Jining this summer, many houses in the southwest gates were destroyed. Although the county seat was preserved, because Jiaxiang, Juye, Chengwu, Dingtao, and other places in southwestern Shandong are still in the hands of bandits, and supplies are blocked by the bandits, the market is depressed and far from what it used to be.

<h3>Special Issue Celebrating Telecommunications Memorial Day, Inscription by Yu Jian, December 28, 36th Year: Explaining the Significance of Telecommunications Memorial Day</h3>
<p>— Yu Bingjian</p>
<p>When the country has a grand undertaking or an extraordinary cause that is worth being remembered and admired by future generations, one day of the year is usually designated as a permanent memorial day. Therefore, there are festivals for industry and commerce, and celebrations for the nation. The purpose is to show the people of the country to carry on the past and open up the future, with good intentions. Now, on the occasion of our country's first Telecommunications Memorial Day, I, Yu Jian, am not talented, and I would like to explain its meaning to highlight the origin of the naming.</p>
<p>Back in the late Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty, the court was decadent, and foreign aggression was becoming more urgent. Many gentry officials were accustomed to following conventions and sticking to old ways. Only Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Commerce of the Northern Ocean and Governor-General of Zhili, rejected public opinion and strongly advocated the Self-Strengthening Movement, resolutely adopting Western scientific civilization to promote the New Policies. The telecommunications industry was thus introduced into our country. In the fifth year of Guangxu (1879 AD), Li Hongzhang erected a cable at the Dagu Fort to reach Tianjin to test military communications. In the sixth year, he requested permission to establish the North and South Ocean Telegraph, stipulating that the route would run from Tianjin along the Grand Canal, passing through Ningqing, Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and reaching Shanghai. In the seventh year, the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau was established in Tianjin, and Sheng Xuanhuai was appointed as the general manager. On the eighth day of the eleventh lunar month of the same year (December 28th), the Tianjin-Shanghai line was completed. Telegraphs were sent and received, and public use was opened. This was the beginning of our country's own telecommunications business.</p>
<p>The importance of telecommunications to a country is like the nervous system to the human body. It occupies an extremely important position in national defense, politics, economy, industry, and culture. Therefore, the length of the telecommunications lines and the quality of the machinery can be used as criteria for inferring the strength of a country and the prosperity of its culture. Looking at the civilized countries of Europe and America, telecommunications lines are like nets, running vertically and horizontally. This is why they can see distant countries as neighbors and connect the whole country as one. Looking back at our country, it also presented a thriving scene in the years before the Anti-Japanese War. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war against Japan, much of the original facilities were damaged. During the Anti-Japanese War, although materials were scarce and equipment was insufficient, it was still able to supply military needs and provide civilian use. After the Yi chiefs surrendered and returned east, the authorities, recognizing the importance of telecommunications construction, devoted themselves to the task. In the past two years, they have worked hard, and the scale has been roughly completed. However, looking to the future, they still feel that the cause is great and the responsibility is heavy.</p>
<p>Recently, the transport authorities, believing that the foundation of telecommunications construction after the war has been established, have expressly stipulated that December 28th of each year, that is, the first day of the development of our country's telecommunications industry, as Telecommunications Memorial Day in order to intensify improvement and generally develop business. Telecommunications agencies in various places are ordered to conduct business reviews on this day to inject encouragement into the commemoration and seek continuous renewal. The meaning is profound and worthy of cherishing. Telecommunications is a tool for public communication. Innovation and improvement rely on the cooperation and guidance of all sectors of society. Now, on the occasion of the first Telecommunications Memorial Day, I respectfully record a few words, hoping to seek advice from the gentlemen of the world!</p>
<h3>The Understanding that the Telecommunications Sector Should Have Regarding Telecommunications Memorial Day</h3>
<p>— Zhao Li</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, China's telecommunications industry was showing a thriving atmosphere, advancing towards a new path. Significant progress had been made in domestic and international telegraphs, as well as urban and long-distance telephones. If it had not been for the Japanese invaders' insane aggression, all the new facilities and plans for our telecommunications industry could have been completed on schedule by now, and there would certainly have been a new look. Tracing back to the July 7th Incident and the subsequent August 22nd Shanghai Battle, which evolved into the sacred and great full-scale War of Resistance, during this period, telecommunications, being the eyes and ears of the military, had to maintain smooth military communications. Therefore, the responsibilities and work of telecommunications employees suddenly became heavier. Later, as the National Army moved inland and the government relocated westward, telecommunications employees also withdrew with them, and new communication networks were built in the inland provinces to meet military needs. However, during this period, not only was there a lack of equipment and the source of foreign goods cut off, but also the enemy's artillery fire and bombing were fierce. Once built, they were destroyed, and the difficulties and hardships were indescribable. Fortunately, the telecommunications employees, with a spirit of adventure and perseverance, buried themselves in hard work and were able to overcome all difficulties and complete the most arduous mission. Therefore, this period can be called the most difficult and glorious page in the history of telecommunications.</p>
<p>In August of the 34th year [1945], the War of Resistance was won. Because telecommunications is an important tool for transmitting government orders and promoting economic, cultural, industrial, and commercial activities, it was given priority in reconstruction ahead of other industries. In addition to restoring the original telecommunications institutions and communication equipment in the occupied areas, it also took over the telecommunications industry in the Northeast and Taiwan and actively reorganized it. At the same time, the machinery and equipment in major cities with heavy telegraph and telephone traffic were strengthened, and their communication efficiency was improved, striving for rapid and accurate telecommunications and promoting their development. In the past two years, considerable achievements have been made and have been well received by society. However, the replenishment of equipment is still limited, the cultivation of telecommunications talent is still insufficient, and the domestic military operations are still in progress, and the social economy is still showing signs of turbulence. There are still many constraints to implementing comprehensive construction, so that telecommunications facilities have not yet fully kept pace with the advanced era and met the needs of the people, and cannot compete with advanced countries in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The transportation authorities, in order to raise the awareness of telecommunications employees and awaken the attention of the people, specially selected December 28th, the day when commercial telegraphs were first opened sixty-six years ago, as Telecommunications Memorial Day. Today is our first Telecommunications Memorial Day and also a great commemorative day for the telecommunications sector in our country's history. In addition to celebrating and rejoicing, we should be vigilant, make a comprehensive review of the past, and formulate far-reaching plans for the future, so that the people of the whole country can understand the true meaning of the country's emphasis on telecommunications, and then gain the support of the people and jointly build new telecommunications. Every year today, every telecommunications practitioner can review the past, plan for the future, and match it with the spirit of hard work shown during the War of Resistance, and work hard to achieve small success in three years and great success in ten years. The future of telecommunications will be infinitely bright. I would like to encourage my colleagues in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Submarine Cables within Our Country</h3>
<p>— Hua Shijian</p>
<p>Submarine cables are a type of wired telegraph. In their manufacture, copper wire is used as the core, which is covered with a special rubber as insulation, lined with hemp rope, and then wrapped with steel wires as thick as fingers or arms. Placed on the seabed, they are both heavy and strong, stretching for hundreds or thousands of miles. The electric current passes through this innermost copper core, through the vast seabed, to reach the other shore, and is indeed a powerful tool for electrical communication. Before the war, there were two submarine cables between Shanghai and Tianjin in our country, which used high-speed telegraph machines to transmit North China telegrams, which were very beneficial. During the war, they were stolen by the enemy and have not been restored to this day. The evolution of submarine cables within our country is briefly described below: Shanghai-Hong Kong Line: In the tenth year of Tongzhi [1871], the submarine cable of the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company, from Hong Kong via Xiamen's Gulangyu, was laid to Wusong, Shanghai, 950 nautical miles long. This was the beginning of foreign operation of the telecommunications industry in our country. The company set up an office on the Bund in Shanghai (in the building behind the present-day Bank of Communications) and started business. At first, it only received and sent telegrams in foreign languages, and then it created a four-character code to receive and send telegrams in Chinese (the four-character Chinese telegraph book compiled by the company at that time was different from the current one, so the current telegraph book is also called the "New Telegraph Compilation"). In the same year, the British Great Eastern Telegraph Company also laid a submarine cable from Hong Kong via Chuanshi Mountain in Fuzhou to Baoshan, 924 nautical miles long, and operated with the Great Northern Company. In the twelfth year of Tongzhi, because it was inconvenient to have people deliver telegrams from Wusong and Baoshan to Shanghai, the companies arbitrarily erected land lines to connect with the submarine cables to Shanghai. This matter was protested by our government many times, and it was agreed that the government would prepare a price to recover the poles and wires and lend them to the company for use in order to protect sovereignty. Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu First Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu [1900], during the Boxer Rebellion, the land telegraph poles and wires in North China were destroyed. When the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, the Great Eastern and Great Northern companies took the opportunity to lay a submarine cable from Dagu near Tianjin to Wusong, with a landing in Yantai in the middle, 729 nautical miles long. Sheng Xuanhuai, the director of telegraph administration, wanted to stop it but could not, so he paid a price of 210,000 pounds of British gold to recover it. At that time, there was no such huge amount of money, so it was agreed that within 30 years, the telegram fees received on the line would be used to repay the principal and interest annually. Before the debt was paid off, the line would be managed by the two companies on behalf of the government. It was not until December 22, 1930, that our country recovered it for self-management. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the War of Resistance broke out, and the line was blocked and impassable, and then stolen by the enemy and moved elsewhere. Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu Second Line: In the 11th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications added the second Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable due to the increase in international and North China telegraph business. It was ordered from the Japanese Furukawa Company and was 720 nautical miles long. It was also stolen and moved by the enemy during the War of Resistance. Xuwen-Haikou Line: In the 34th year of Guangxu [1908], the Telegraph Administration Bureau laid a submarine cable from the coast of Xuwen County, which belongs to the Leizhou Peninsula, across the Qiongzhou Strait to Haikou on Hainan Island, 15 nautical miles long, because Hainan Island was isolated overseas. The project was completed and the news was reported, but it was subsequently blocked and impassable. Chuanshi-Tamsui Line: There was a submarine cable from Chuanshi Mountain in Fuzhou to Tamsui Port in Taipei, which was laid in the 13th year of Guangxu [1887], 117 nautical miles long. At that time, our country had a submarine cable ship named "Feice" converted from a gunboat, specializing in repairing this cable. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 [Year of Jiawu], Taiwan was ceded, and the line was sold to Japan in the 24th year of Guangxu, and the submarine cable ship was abandoned. Yantai-Weihai Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu, the British Great Eastern Company took advantage of the Boxer Rebellion to set up a submarine cable from Yantai to Weihaiwei, 41 nautical miles long. In October 1930, the United Kingdom returned Weihaiwei, and the line was recovered at the same time. Weihaiwei-Liugong Island Line: There were telegraph and telephone submarine cables from Weihaiwei to Liugong Island in the nearby sea, each 2 nautical miles long, which were also laid by the Great Eastern Company in the 26th year of Guangxu. They were recovered at the same time as the Yantai-Weihai Line in 1930. Yantai-Dalian Line: There was a submarine cable from Yantai to Dalian on the Liaodong Peninsula, 90 nautical miles long, which was originally established by Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War in the 31st year of Guangxu [1905], it was occupied by Japan. In the 34th year of Guangxu, it was agreed with Japan that the section of the line 7.5 nautical miles from Yantai would belong to our country. Qingdao-Sasebo Line: In the 23rd year of Guangxu [1897], after Germany occupied Jiaozhou Bay in Shandong, it installed a submarine cable from Qingdao to Yantai. In the 26th year, taking advantage of the Boxer Rebellion, it extended it to Shanghai. In the 3rd year of the Republic, during the First World War, Japan declared war on Germany, captured Qingdao, and seized this line, changing it to run between Qingdao and Sasebo, Japan, 537 nautical miles long. At the Washington Conference in the 10th year of the Republic, after repeated negotiations, it was recovered. At the end of the 13th year, it was agreed to divide the cable in half, totaling 268 nautical miles, and zero, which belonged to our country. The right to receive and send telegrams at the Qingdao end was also recovered by us. Shanghai-Yap Line: In the 30th year of Guangxu [1904], the German-Dutch Telegraph Company installed a submarine cable from Yap Island in the Pacific Ocean (approximately 10 degrees north latitude and 140 degrees east longitude) to Baoshan, landing in Shanghai, 1,777 nautical miles long, and set up a telegraph office at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Sichuan Road. In the 3rd year of the Republic, Japan declared war on Germany, and the Yap section was seized by Japan and moved elsewhere. The Baoshan section was first taken over by the Dutch Consul in Shanghai. After our country declared war on Germany, we repeatedly urged the Dutch Consul to hand it over, but he refused. What our government received was only the building of the German-Hewa Company on Fuzhou Road. The former Shanghai Telegraph Bureau moved into that building from No. 1 Li on the Bund of Fuzhou Road in the 10th year of the Republic and served as the current general business office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. Japanese Shanghai-Nagasaki Line: In the 2nd year of the Republic, Japan laid a submarine cable between Nagasaki and Baoshan, 468 nautical miles long, and set up a telegraph office at the corner of Xiye Road and Tiantong Road in Shanghai. It was first named the Japan Post Office and later the Japan Telegraph Office, receiving and sending telegrams between various places in Japan and Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese enemy used this cable to transmit military telegrams, which was extremely active. After the 30th year [1941], because the land cable between Shanghai and Songjiang was blocked, telegrams could not be sent. In the autumn of the 34th year [1945], the War of Resistance was won, and the office building was taken over by us, which is now the Coast Radio Station and the branch office of the Telecommunications Bureau. Shanghai-Manila Line: In the 28th year of Guangxu [1902], the American Pacific Submarine Cable Company laid a submarine cable from Manila in the Philippines to Baoshan, 1,264 nautical miles long. In the 29th year, it arbitrarily set up a land line to connect to Shanghai to receive and send Sino-US telegrams. In the 30th year, a contract was signed, allowing it to land, but the land cable was handed over to our country as our country's property. Xiamen-Haiphong Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu, the French Telegraph Company, taking advantage of our rebellion, arbitrarily laid a line from Toulane, Haiphong, to Gulangyu, Xiamen, about 800 nautical miles long, and openly opened an office for business. Repeated negotiations to remove it were ineffective. Later, this cable was blocked and impassable. In the 13th year of the Republic, the French side wanted to sell this broken line to our country, but the request was not granted. Longkou-Dalian Line: In the 3rd year of the Republic, Japan declared war on Germany and captured Qingdao. It then laid a submarine cable from Longkou to Dalian, about 110 miles long. Both ends of this line were within our country's territorial waters. Japan knew that it had violated the agreement, so it removed the line in October of that year. Dalian-Sasebo Line and Dalian-Nagasaki Line: These two lines were previously laid by Japan. With the victory of the War of Resistance, they should be confiscated and returned to us. The above is the general situation of submarine cables within our country. The Great Eastern Company's Saigon-Hong Kong Cable originally landed at Chuanshi Mountain in the middle and was connected to Fuzhou. The Great Northern Company's Wusong-Hong Kong Cable originally landed at Gulangyu in the middle and was connected to Xiamen. According to the old contract provisions, each company could set up offices in Fuzhou, Chuanshi Mountain, Xiamen, and Gulangyu to receive and send telegrams. After the expiration of the contract at the end of 1930, all the telegraph offices set up by the company in the above four places were closed. In May 1933, the Ministry of Communications recovered the right of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific companies to receive and send submarine cable telegrams in Shanghai. The submarine cable receiving and sending office set up by each company on Edward Road was recovered and reorganized by our country. Shanghai to Wusong and Baoshan is our country's territory. Without our country's permission, submarine cables may not be dragged ashore. The landing rights of each company expired at the end of 1930, and were subsequently extended for 14 years, and expired again at the end of 1944. It is found that once a submarine cable is laid, wind and rain cannot invade it, and raging waves cannot break it. The transmission is stable and secret. Observing that after the outbreak of the War of Resistance in the 26th year, the Japanese invaders, though busy with military affairs, still added many submarine cables in Taiwan, Manila, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hainan Island, Haiphong, Singapore, Borneo, and the Dutch East Indies. It is enough to show that in addition to wireless telegraphs and land cables, submarine cables still occupy an important position in national defense and commerce. Our country's telecommunications industry has been bound by foreign ropes for a long time. At this time of striving for progress, will readers also be moved in their hearts?</p>

<h3>Looking at Telecommunications Construction from "China's Destiny"</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang instructed in "China's Destiny" that the total workload of telecommunications construction is 9,000,000 telephones, 36,000,000 line-pair kilometers of telecommunications circuits, and 3,000 wireless radio stations. The initial ten-year workload is 2,250,000 telephones, 9,000,000 line-pair kilometers of telecommunications circuits, and 2,000 wireless radio stations, of which telephones are targeted at two per 100 people. Telecommunications circuits include urban telephone circuits, long-distance telephone circuits, and telegraph circuits, each with overhead lines and cables. As for wireless radio stations, they are used for communication. The initial ten years must be used as much as possible, so the completion is particularly high. (All)</p>

<h3>A Historical Account of China's Telecommunications Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>(1) Wired Telegraph</p>
<p>Wired telegraphy was established the earliest. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods (approximately 1861-1874 AD), the Qing court prepared to erect poles and wires to test telegraphy. However, at that time, the people's intelligence was not developed, and farmers in various places, seeing that erecting telegraph poles would destroy their land and ancestral graves, rose up to destroy them, and the project could not proceed. It was not until 1879 AD (5th year of Guangxu) that Li Hongzhang tentatively set up military telegraph wires between Tianjin and Dagu with remarkable results, and only then was he granted permission to erect the North-South Ocean Telegraph wires from Tianjin along the Haihe River to Shanghai, and commercial telegrams began to be received and sent on December 28, 1881 AD.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, wired telegraphs encountered destruction by farmers in the gestation period. After its birth, from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the success of the Northern Expedition, there were revolutionary uprisings in the front and warlord civil wars in the back, and destruction was encountered at any time. Only in the short ten years from the establishment of the National Government in 1927 to the outbreak of the War of Resistance in 1937 was the situation relatively stable, and there was an opportunity for active construction. During the War of Resistance, the areas along the Yangtze River and the coast were successively occupied, and the loss of wires and equipment was extremely large. Until today, two years after the war, except for the lines in the southwest, which increased due to wartime construction, the restored areas not only have not recovered, but some areas continue to be destroyed by war.</p>
<p>(2) Wired Telephone</p>
<p>Our country's self-operated urban telephone service began in 1900 when the Nanjing Telegraph Bureau also operated urban telephone services. At that time, there were only 14 telephone subscribers in the entire city, which were exclusively for official use. Later, equipment was added to also provide civilian use and gradually expanded to major cities. After 1927, development was particularly rapid. All urban telephones in major cities mostly switched to automatic telephones. By 1936, the total capacity of telephones managed by the national government reached more than 70,000. Long-distance telephones had also completed the nine-province communication network. During the war, telephone equipment was heavy and difficult to transport, and the losses were severe. Active restoration after the war has achieved good results. According to statistics at the end of June 1947, the current total capacity of urban telephones managed by the national government has reached more than 167,000, more than double the pre-war number. Long-distance telephones have also reached the entire country.</p>
<p>(3) Wireless Telegraph</p>
<p>As early as 1905 AD, our country had begun to test wireless telegraphy, but the initial results were not significant and were only for military use. After the National Government established its capital in 1927, the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Committee competed to set up shortwave radio stations in various places, and wireless telegraphy began to be used for commercial purposes. After ten years of hard work, the progress was rapid, especially since the application of automatic machines to wireless communication, the efficiency has been strengthened. During the war, wired telegraphs were frequently destroyed, and long-distance communication in the rear almost entirely relied on wireless communication. This phenomenon has not changed until now.</p>
<p>Our country's various telecommunications constructions generally began in the political center area, but international wireless communication was first established outside the customs. In 1927, when Zhang Zuolin ruled the three northeastern provinces, he established a large-power radio station in Shenyang to communicate with Germany and France. At that time, telegrams sent from various places within the customs to foreign countries had to be transshipped through Luoyang. As for the International Wireless Radio Station, it began to be established in 1928 (1928 AD). At that time, the wireless communication business was still managed by the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Committee. The two sides simultaneously planned to establish international radio stations. Later, the Transportation Construction was merged, the authority was concentrated, and the progress was accelerated. The large-scale International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications was officially opened on December 6, 1930, and had already begun to communicate with Manila before the opening. As of now, the International Radio Station has more than 20 transceivers, and the total power of the industry is 400 kilowatts. There are currently 22 direct international communication circuits and one international telephone circuit. The amount is close and is being used to replace telex and multiplex telegraph equipment in various major circuits. The former can ensure the absolute accuracy of telegram transmission, and the latter can increase the transmission rate by four times and ensure confidentiality.</p>
<p>(4) Wireless Telephone</p>
<p>Before the war, wireless telephone services had been opened for domestic Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Hankou, and international Sino-Japanese and Sino-US wireless telephone services. After the war, the international Sino-US wireless telephone has been restored on one route, and Sino-British calls will also be opened in early 1948. As for domestic long-distance calls, wireless telephone circuits have been used.</p>

<h3>Formal Graduation Certificates Issued to Students of National Provisional Universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Pingjin</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 27th] The Ministry of Education has decided to issue formal graduation certificates to students of the National Provisional University cram schools held in Beijing, Shanghai, and Pingjin during the repatriation period, who have completed their studies and have been issued graduation certificates. Graduates of these three Provisional Universities can send their certificates with two photos to the Ministry for exchange for formal certificates.</p>
<h3>Government Yuan Has New Regulations on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Regarding self-funded students applying for foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan previously announced the "Regulations on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Publicly and Self-Funded Students," which stipulates that self-funded students who pass the Ministry of Education's examination, scholarship students approved by the Ministry of Education to study abroad, researchers approved by the Ministry of Education who have obtained foreign scholarships to study abroad, and personnel hired to teach abroad can all settle foreign exchange at the official rate. In addition, self-funded students who have been studying at foreign universities without the approval of the Ministry of Education can settle at the market rate. Recently, the Executive Yuan has issued two new regulations, instructing the Central Bank: All self-funded students who have gone abroad with the approval of the "Chairman" and "approved by the Ministry of Education before October 24th of this year after passing the Zhu Jing examination" can also settle foreign exchange at the market rate, and the Central Bank has successively sent letters to designated banks to inform them. It is heard that if the applicant can prove which category of student the beneficiary belongs to within the regulations and attach the Ministry of Education's documents and other documents required in accordance with the regulations, the bank can avoid the trouble of returning and inquiring and can obtain rapid processing.</p>

<h3>Education Statistics for Hainan Island: Number of Schools Reaches 2,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Haikou, Hainan Island, 27th (Airmail)] Education on Hainan Island was quite developed before the war. The education in Wenchang County ranked fourth in Guangdong Province. However, after the island was occupied by the Japanese invaders, most schools were unwilling to implement enslavement education under the enemy's iron hooves. They stopped operating or relocated to other places, resulting in many educational venues being occupied and destroyed by the Japanese enemy, severely damaging the education sector. Since the victory, education has recovered, and the relocated schools have resumed classes one after another. Those that had stopped operating have also gradually reopened, and there are many new schools this autumn. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 32 middle and upper schools on the island, with approximately 10,000 students; approximately 300 central national schools, with approximately 50,000 students; approximately 2,000 guaranteed national schools, with approximately 130,000 students; and approximately 500 other private elementary schools, with approximately 40,000 students. According to people in the education sector, the quantity of education on the island is increasing daily, but the quality has not yet improved. The academic level of students nationwide has generally declined after the war, and Hainan Island is no exception.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday, New Agency Established on January 1st and Opens for Business on January 2nd</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee held an extraordinary committee meeting yesterday at 3 PM, chaired by Chairman Yuan Liang. Vice Chairman Liu Siying, committee members Liu Gongyun, Zhang Xuan, Hu Jingliang, Wang Lanseng, Liu Wen and directors Duan Xuan, Li Yuanding, Gao Bingtai, and Chen Shuhui were present. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also attended and gave instructions. Minister Chen delivered a speech, stating that the committee's task was arduous, and that the past work of the Textile Adjustment Committee had mostly failed. He said that官商 cooperation should be promoted in the future to run the committee well. Chairman Yuan then delivered a speech, mainly focusing on three points: 1. If administrative power can be effectively implemented, the cotton yarn and cloth management methods will be successfully implemented. 2. Malpractice always originates from people, so in the future, the selection of personnel should be extremely cautious and select the best talents. 3. While implementing management for manufacturers, they should also be supported so that they are willing to be managed. He also reported on three points: 1. The official seal of the new agency has been issued. 2. The new agency will be established on January 1st and will open for business on January 2nd. 3. Personnel below the director level are being selected. Finally, the committee members exchanged opinions on the cotton yarn and cloth management methods.</p>

<p>Strengthen Inspection Work to Cooperate with the Policy of Unified Purchase and Sale</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The tenth meeting of the Agricultural and Forestry Department's Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee was held at the Textile Construction Company yesterday at 4 PM, chaired by Zhou Changyun. The important agenda items were: (1) Inspection of cotton should be strengthened to cooperate with the unified purchase and sale policy. The committee is requested to allocate 12 billion yuan for the annual inspection expenses and also recommends that during the inspection, cargo owners voluntarily donate some fees. (2) In the past, the promotion of ramie in Hangzhou was solely funded by Textile Construction. The committee is now requested to allocate a portion of the Cotton Production Improvement Fund, and a promotional budget of 9.8 billion yuan should also be prepared, and the government is requested to raise funds. (3) The purpose of purchasing improved cotton seeds this year is for 250,000 seeds, which can be planted next year to produce 3 million mu of improved cotton, which can produce 1 million dan of improved cotton.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Opens Board of Directors Meeting to Decide Future Business Direction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company convened a board of directors meeting yesterday morning at 10 AM, chaired by Chairman Chen Qitian. The meeting lasted until 2 PM. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Reported Matters: (1) The total annual production volume of all factories under Textile Construction this year is estimated at 742,000 bales of cotton yarn, 15,948,000 pieces of cotton cloth, 2,058,000 yards of wool fabrics, 2,576,000 pounds of wool yarn, 8,544,100 yards of hemp, 4,885,000 yards of hemp bags, 515,000 pounds of silk, 1,697,000 yards of silk fabrics, 32,600 pieces of knitted underwear, 786,000 pieces of clothing, 3,400 ribbing pieces, 4,541,000 pieces of dyed and finished fabrics, and 198,000 pounds of yarn. (2) Exports from June of this year to date are valued at US$3,986,877, £2,020,206, $1,219,540, and Rs. 413,930, for a total value of US$14,155,525. (3) Losses of cotton stockpiles in various places, including Shijiazhuang, Longhai Road, and Northeast China, are valued at 500 billion yuan. (4) Total donations to the outside world for the year, including military apportionments of over 90 billion yuan and ordinary donations of 10 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) Factories in Qingdao have suspended work due to a shortage of coal. The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee has agreed to allocate 3,000 tons first, and Qinhuangdao can also send 2,000 tons. The company has collected 1,700 tons in Shanghai, so it can temporarily support operations in the short term. As for exchanging yarn for coal from India, the board members agreed that it is better to exchange yarn for coal than to suffer losses from suspension of work. It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Transport Management Committee should be consulted. (2) The company can consider accepting the commission from the Yarn Management Committee for purchasing and distribution. However, it is only a commercial agency and does not bear any administrative responsibility. (3) The company's cotton yarn listing has two types: negotiated prices and stock market prices, which are quite inconsistent. It was decided to determine how to proceed after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy. (4) The company faced three major difficulties this year: (A) Military debt, (B) National Bank's entrusted spinning, (C) Losses from negotiated prices. As a result, although the company nominally had a profit of 1 trillion yuan this year, the material stock was actually reduced. For example, cotton was reduced by more than 500,000 dan compared to last year. Now that the policy of unified purchase and sale is implemented, the actual profit will be even less. It is hoped that the government will not have excessive expectations of the company when preparing the budget next year.</p>
<h3>Many Close Out Speculative Positions, Hua Shares Show Weakness Near Closing</h3>
<p>The Hua shares fluctuated unpredictably yesterday due to conflicting rumors. The general participants felt at a crossroads, and although the shorts had made up for their positions outside the market, the impact was minimal due to most closing out speculative positions. The occasional upward movements lacked momentum, and the market ended on a weak note near closing. The situation of small-cap stocks improved slightly compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Initially, rumors that transactions could not be completed before the New Year had a negative impact, and the market opened with a sharp decline. Yong Yarn opened at 537 yuan and 535 yuan, showing an inverted price curve. Immediate delivery shares once fell to 535 yuan, then rose to 547 yuan, the same price as current delivery, showing a slight rebound. Spot prices outside the market opened low at 0.18 yuan and 0.225 yuan, once rising to high prices of 552 yuan for immediate delivery and 557 yuan for future delivery. Then, they gradually declined to within 540 yuan. As a result, strong buyers of immediate and future delivery shares rallied to around 545 yuan. However, the gains were not sustained, and the prices fell to low prices of 532 yuan for immediate delivery and 534 yuan for future delivery. The closing price for the morning was 536 yuan and 539 yuan. Yonggong and other small-cap stocks were relatively stable. China Mud had few transactions and closed at a low price. As a result, compared to the previous day's immediate delivery shares, Xinhua Wuhe and Datong were still flat. China mud fell by 10%, Yongye rose by 0.5%, and Yong Yarn, Zhabei, Xinnuo, Meiya, Jingfu, China-France, Underwear, Matches, Business, and Tongyi were slightly lower. The future delivery shares fell by about half a yuan, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Average, Foreign Stocks Hover</h3>
<p>Government bonds averaged and changed little yesterday. Tongbing opened at 30,700 yuan and immediately fell to 29,400 yuan before rebounding to hover outside the 30,000 yuan mark. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, A, B, and D were flat, C fell by 400 yuan, and E fell by 300 yuan. The total volume was less than 3 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also only hovered yesterday. Yisha opened at 423,000 yuan. The highest price was no more than 426,000 yuan, and the lowest price was only 416,000 yuan, before closing with a hovering posture. Banks and foreign firms bought, while Guangdong firms and retail investors sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Federal Shipping, Tram, and Xiangtai were all flat, Ken Zhi fell by 0.5%, and the remaining shares were slightly up or down.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was still firm at the morning opening yesterday. Later, it was rumored that private yarn factories would sell off their stocks in large quantities, and market sentiment suddenly turned weak. Moreover, as the holidays were approaching, few traders and brokers were active, and transactions were quite light. In the market, only some bargain hunting occurred. For the whole day, 42-count Baoguang yarn from replica factories was in demand, and 16-count Guangming Tiannu coarse yarn was purchased by brokers, and prices rose by 100,000 yuan. The supply and demand for 42-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng were equal, and prices remained unchanged. In addition, the prices of most coarse and fine yarns fell by 100,000 to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the approaching Gregorian New Year and tight credit, many traders were selling cotton cloth. Moreover, with the imminent implementation of the unified purchase and sale method, the market was likely to stabilize, and market sentiment was scattered. Buyers were all engaged in resale activities, and it was also reported that dyeing factories needed cash and had sold off large quantities of spot goods. Moreover, Textile Construction Company was about to open for cloth allocation, and the quota was abundant. Shanxi traders were short on cash and dumped a lot of spot goods. The market was shrouded in a bearish atmosphere, and prices fell in a straight line. Finally, the spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth outside the market fell by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and the prices of other grades of fine cloth also fell by 15,000 to 23,000 yuan. The overall trend was that Jumping Carp bleached cloth was in demand by Hankou traders, rising by 20,000 yuan, and Grey Light was slightly absorbed by umbrella factories, while the atmosphere in other cloth markets was clearly weak.</p>
<h3>Stable Money Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the large inflow of cash into Shanghai yesterday, the money market was stable, with a hidden rate of around 0.24. The net difference between the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 145.5 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 98.3 billion, the Large Exchange issuing 27.4 billion, foreign firms receiving 11.9 billion, the Small Exchange issuing 13 billion, the China Bank receiving 36.4 billion, the Jiaotong Bank issuing 19.8 billion, the China Agricultural Bank receiving 13.8 billion, and the China Trust Bureau issuing 8.197 billion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Payment Methods for Privately-Owned Industries Purchasing Japanese Reparation Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently formulated payment methods for privately-owned industries purchasing Japanese reparation goods and has notified factories in various places through the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office. The methods stipulate that any factory applying to purchase reparation goods should sign a contract for delivery and payment with the Ministry of Economic Affairs upon approval of the purchase. If the price of the goods being purchased has been assessed, it should be handled in accordance with Article 6 of the Executive Yuan's published methods for private enterprises applying to purchase Japanese reparation goods. If the valuation of the goods is still preliminary, a deposit of 5% of the estimated price should be paid first. If the goods are being shipped from Japanese ports and have not yet arrived at Chinese ports, 15% of the preliminary estimated price should be paid. If all the goods have arrived, the 15% of the value should be paid at the same time as the deposit. The remaining 65% of the payment will be allowed to be paid off in two years. All prices are calculated in US dollars. However, privately-owned enterprises that purchase the goods can pay in national currency at the central bank's market price at the time of each payment. The shipping costs must be paid in full by the purchaser at one time.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Prices Rise; Factory-Processed Plain Silk Goods Fall</h3>
<p>The price of artificial silk on the market yesterday rose slightly again. This was because the Central Trust Bureau would stop allocating the first phase of goods next week, which calmed people's hearts somewhat. No. 120, brand "Xu," grade 1A, lustrous, opened in the morning at 79 million yuan and closed at 80 million yuan for spot prices. The Monday futures traded in the morning at 81.5 to 81.6 million yuan, but softened in the afternoon, dropping to 81 million yuan. Later, it even fell to 80.5 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory-Processed Silk</p>
<p>The market was quiet yesterday, and prices remained relatively stable. CD grade was quoted at around 86 to 87 million yuan, with higher qualities carrying an additional premium of around 5 million yuan, and mid-grade qualities carrying an additional premium of around 3 million yuan, similar to the previous day. Transactions of dried silk were also scarce, and market prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday on the market, silk quilt covers declined in price. Goods from the Huaqiang brand remained firm at the opening, around 53 to 54 million yuan. Due to uneven supply and demand, quoted prices gradually decreased, with spot prices at the close at 47 million yuan, down 5 million yuan from the previous day, and Monday futures at 51 million yuan. Dachen checkered cloth followed, down 2,000 yuan, to 135,000 yuan. For other goods, factory prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Firm; Oil Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total volume of grain in the North and South markets was over 15,100 *shi*. The South market initially rose but later weakened, resulting in no gains or losses for *japonica* and *indica* rice. High-quality *baiyuan* rice was in demand, while lower-quality rice was stagnant. The situation for *yinyuan* rice was similar. The North market was sluggish and weak. Flour rose again to the limit, and bran continued to advance rapidly towards a peak. Sales of bean cake remained weak, but raw materials were expensive, so sellers remained firm. The soybean market was quiet for out-of-town buyers, and local trading was slow, but oil mills continued to absorb large quantities, and demand was brisk. Reports of price increases from inland areas strengthened buyers' confidence. *Du huang* soybeans rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and Central China soybeans rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. *Lvdou* mung beans saw slight imports from Southeast Asia, rising by over 10,000 yuan, and red beans rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Sales of white beans were average, causing a rise of 10,000 yuan, and cowpeas followed, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Retailers purchased red sorghum, and demand from distilleries was not weak, leading to a surge of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Corn sales to northern areas turned sluggish, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Groundnuts were being actively sought after by both local and out-of-town buyers, rising steadily, up another 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shantou relied on Ningbo merchants, and Tianjin also got involved, sending prices soaring. Various oils successively rose by varying amounts from over 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, with a slight softening seen near the close.</p>
<h3>Shortages During Cargo Collection at the Wharf Should Be Reported to Customs Inspectors</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that when merchants collect cargo at the wharf, they should first carefully inspect the goods they are collecting. If any shortages are discovered, they should report them to the customs inspectors stationed at the wharf before the goods are completely removed. After verification by the inspectors, they should be noted on the release form for verification. It is stipulated that from January 1, 1948, if a merchant encounters a shortage of goods but does not report it to the customs officer on-site at the time of collection and have it certified, the customs will not recognize the short-landing situation since it cannot be determined. The merchant may not make any claims to the customs afterward.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Cloth Sales</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 11,380 bolts with 316 application forms. Seven forms were from manufacturers, purchasing 840 bolts, and 309 forms were cloth numbers, purchasing 10,540 bolts.</p>
<p>Overcoat Fabric Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>In the wool market, thin fabrics continued to be preferred. Apart from flannelette, thicker fabrics such as overcoat fabric, plain thick fabric, and Melton cloth all declined in sales and price. Although the weather is severely cold, and it is the right time for overcoat fabric to sell well, most people want to sell their existing stock. Local buyers have no intention of adding more in advance. Moreover, since Christmas has passed, most retail sales have already occurred. Generally, 70% to 80% of customers have already ordered and prepared their winter clothes. Therefore, there are only scattered small sales, and there are no original bolt or full-box transactions.</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Sales Active</h3>
<p>The tea market has not yet entered a lively state due to the supply and demand situation, resulting in unremarkable transactions. The process remains quiet with little activity. According to industry insiders, local shops and stores still have a strong desire for this year's special Qimen tea. However, the market supply of this type of tea is scarce, so it is in short supply. It is predicted that the selling price may continue to increase.</p>
<h3>China Trust Foreign Trade Office Explains Sino-Japanese Trade</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the China Trust Foreign Trade Office, Japanese goods are still arriving continuously. Today, a batch of railway ties arrived in Shanghai. Currently, among the countries trading with Japan, except for the United States, countries such as Britain and Australia all have overdrafts, and China is not alone in this. Moreover, China's overdraft amount is not the largest among the Allied nations. There are two reasons for the overdraft: first, it was originally planned to ship one million tons of salt to Japan this year, but due to prioritizing domestic sales, only 200,000 tons were actually used for trade; second, the original iron sand shipment to Japan was later handled by the Resources Committee to obtain foreign exchange, so this batch of iron sand was sold to Britain instead. Due to economic difficulties on both sides, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade next year is not expected to increase significantly. The Chinese side hopes to import from Japan not only transportation and industrial and mining equipment but also artificial silk. China's exports will still mainly be...[gap in text]. It is possible that there will be some iron sand. As for combined sugar soybeans, it is still hoped that surplus products can be exported, but only on the condition of obtaining cash.

<h3>Three Martyrs of the 29th Army: Memories of Short Eaves, Part 3</h3>
<p>At the end of July 1937, Song Zheyuan led his troops to retreat, and Beiping fell to the enemy. Although the Japanese army did not enter the city that day, the atmosphere was filled with sorrow and gloom, and the world seemed to change color. The people of the old capital admired the two generals, Zhao Dengyu and Tong Linge, who died in battle in Nanyuan, and ridiculed General Zhang Zizhong, who succeeded Song as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. It was said that Song Zheyuan had left, Zhao Dengyu had died, and Zhang Zizhong had surrendered. All three were mainstays of the 29th Army, yet they were judged differently, which some called strange.</p>
<p>Zhang Zizhong took office for only a few days before leaving Beiping to participate in the war of resistance. He later died in battle in Hubei, a martyred hero, and his intentions became clear. Song Zheyuan also fought tirelessly and died in western Sichuan. After the victory, in the Martyrs' Shrine at Babaoshan in western Beijing, the spirit tablets of Zhang, Tong, and Zhao were placed in the highest position first. Incense was offered, and they were worshiped by thousands of people. Babaoshan was previously the place where the Japanese worshiped their so-called "loyal spirits," and the immediate retribution was especially gratifying.</p>
<p>After the entire 29th Army retreated, the Japanese selected the city and reluctantly supported it through the so-called "Local Maintenance Association." By the end of the year, the puppet "Provisional Government" suddenly appeared, and the names of the key figures in its organization belonged to the "Qiyang rhyme": Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, Tang Erhe, Wang Shijing, and later Wang Yintai was added. The three "Wangs" took turns serving as the "Chairman of the North China Committee," and people called this puppet organization the "Wang Family Old Shop." In the south of the Yangtze River, Liang (Hongzhi), the head of the puppet "Reformed Government," also had the Qiyang rhyme, and Wang (Zhaoming), the head of the puppet "National Government," also had the Qiyang rhyme. It can be said that "coincidence is stranger than fiction."</p>
<h3>Strange People and Strange Things</h3>
<p>— Wen Ji</p>
<p>A certain person A attempted suicide by drowning. A policeman saw him and threw him a rope, telling him to climb ashore. However, he was determined to die and refused to grab the rope. The policeman became angry and threatened to shoot him dead. Only then did person A obey and climb ashore.</p>
<p>One day, a night newspaper published two news items. One was about a millionaire who committed suicide because of business failure and only had 25,000 yuan left. The other was about a coolie who won the lottery's first prize, receiving 25,000 yuan. Overjoyed, he bought wine and celebrated wildly. However, he got drunk and accidentally died.</p>
<p>Helen Keller, one of the seven wonders of the world, a blind, deaf, and mute American woman, once went to England and met George Bernard Shaw, a strange man from England, with Mrs. Estes. The following conversation took place:</p>
<p>Helen Keller said: "I am very happy to meet you. I have long wanted to know you."</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw retorted: "Why do all Americans say the same thing?"</p>
<p>Helen Keller said: "Why do you hate us Americans so much?"</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw replied: "I don't hate you." His tone implied that Americans were not worth his hatred.</p>
<p>Helen Keller asked: "Then why don't you go to America?"</p>
<p>"Why should I go to America? All the Americans will come to see me."</p>
<p>Mrs. Estes put her hand on Shaw's arm and pushed him, as if he were a child behaving badly in front of guests. She said to Shaw: "Don't you know who this is? This is Helen Keller. She is deaf and blind."</p>
<p>His answer must have greatly surprised everyone present, but Helen Keller did not immediately know what he said because the interpreter's sign language suddenly stopped. She waited suspiciously. After a while, the interpreter told her in sign language what Shaw said.</p>
<p>"What's so strange about that! All Americans are deaf, blind—and mute."</p>
<h3>Tolerance</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Jesus said: "If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well." This is how Christians teach people to be "tolerant and generous." Although such things may not necessarily happen in the world, widening the scope of tolerance and being able to forgive others is, after all, a virtue.</p>
<p>In the East, especially in our country, which emphasizes the golden mean and the principle of reciprocity, people admire those with great magnanimity and tirelessly encourage others to be more tolerant. For example, people often use the warning "A small impatience can ruin great plans" to play the role of peacemaker, hoping that people will not get trapped in narrow-mindedness and emotional impulses, leading to self-suffering and disturbance in narrow spaces. There is also a saying that is easier for people to understand and digest, which is "A prime minister's belly can hold a boat." It does not say "A scholar's belly can hold a boat," but specifically mentions the "prime minister," who in the era of autocracy was a great figure "below one person and above ten thousand," naturally because of this.</p>
<p>Precisely because "a prime minister's belly can hold a boat," there were indeed many great figures in ancient times who were admired for their "magnanimity." Let me just give one or two examples: one is Guo Ziyi, a famous general of the Tang Dynasty, and the other is Wang Dan, a Grand Commandant of the early Song Dynasty. Both are the best examples:</p>
<p>According to historical records, when Duke (Guo Ziyi) entered the court, Yu Chaoen invited him to visit Zhangjing Temple. Yuan Zai, fearing that they would form an alliance, secretly told Duke Guo: "Chaoen is plotting against you." Duke Guo did not listen. His generals requested that armored soldiers accompany him, but Duke Guo said: "I am a minister of the country. He does not have the Emperor's authority, how dare he harm me? If he comes under orders, what do you want to do?" So he urged a few servants to go. Chaoen was surprised and asked the reason. Duke Guo told him what he had heard and said: "I am afraid I have troubled you." Chaoen stroked Duke Guo's face and wept, saying: "If it were not for your generosity, how could I not be suspicious?" Duke Guo was in the midst of petty people fighting around him, and yet he was able to remain calm. How could this be achieved without great magnanimity?</p>
<p>According to the Houde Lu, Grand Commandant Wang Dan recommended Kou Zhun as prime minister. Prime Minister Kou often criticized Grand Commandant Wang to the Emperor, but Grand Commandant Wang always praised Kou's strengths. One day, the Emperor said to Grand Commandant Wang: "Although you praise his virtues, he only talks about your faults." Grand Commandant Wang replied: "It is only natural. I have been in office for a long time, and there must be many shortcomings in my handling of political affairs. Kou Zhun does not hide anything from Your Majesty, which is enough to show his loyalty and uprightness. This is why I value Kou Zhun." When Kou Zhun was a regional military commissioner, he once held a large banquet on his birthday and used extravagant clothes, which was reported by someone. The Emperor was very angry and said to Grand Commandant Wang: "Kou Zhun wants to imitate Me in everything. Is that permissible?" Grand Commandant Wang slowly replied: "Kou Zhun is indeed a capable minister, but he is just a bit silly!" The Emperor's anger subsided. This Grand Commandant Wang's magnanimity can also be considered extreme.</p>
<p>Both of these stories are quite touching. However, it also makes us realize that for a person to be magnanimous, they must have two basic conditions: one is that their thoughts must be broad-minded and their mind must be deep, as in Duke Guo's explanation to his generals and Wang Dan's unwillingness to argue with Kou Zhun. The other is that they must have an extremely rich sense of humor, such as the former's "I am afraid I have troubled you" and the latter's "but he is just a bit silly!" Only in this way can one be calm and accept unpleasant words, and even if they encounter extremely difficult situations, they can laugh it off. Otherwise, it cannot be considered magnanimity.</p>
<h3>Roadside Goose, Frozen to Death Bones</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>Speaking of this year's summer being particularly hot, I remember one day when the scorching sun was blazing and the asphalt road felt sticky, I saw a beggar boy lying in the shade of a utility pole by the roadside, trying to avoid the direct power of the scorching sun. The shadow moved with the sun, so this beggar boy had to move his throne every few minutes in order to get the benefit of the shadow, even if it was limited. These kinds of beggar boys probably only have a shadow left to protect them in the sea of people—to put it "elegantly," this can also be considered summer heat relief.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the climate, which is also like a movie. With a change of camera angle, it is instantly switched to the severe winter with howling winds and breath turning into ice. It is said that there is a wooden house like a wardrobe in my yard. In terms of shape and size, it is a wardrobe, but it houses a family, so it can only be called a "house." It is also divided into upper and lower layers. The lower layer is used to store things. One day, I was walking home at night and passed this wooden house when I heard the voice of a child inside saying, "It's cold!" His mother replied, "Then let's hug each other and sleep." The child asked, "Mom, when can we move back into the house?" "Are you talking about moving into the house that is being built?" "When will that house be built?" This "family" can actually be considered "better off than some."</p>
<p>Let's talk about one bitterly cold day, I saw a so-called "bum" on the street. He was disheveled, covered in dirt, and as thin as firewood. He walked like an automatic piece of wood, wearing only an old and dirty undershirt on his upper body and a pair of torn shorts that couldn't even cover his buttocks on his lower body. His body was very thin, a so-called "willow waist," and his limbs were like tree branches. It was truly unexpected that a person could be so thin and shriveled. He looked like a narrow person reflected in a funhouse mirror. The saying "as thin as a rake" finally felt believable. He dragged himself barefoot in the cold wind, his eyes fixed, not paying attention to anything around him. He was truly a walking stick that deserved the name. This person probably truly "puts life and death out of mind." He no longer had hope, no longer had thoughts, and no longer cared about anything. Everything that makes a person a person had been extinguished, leaving only the simplest biological movements. If someone hit him, he would never fight back, just drag his feet and run away. If someone chased him, he would just walk faster. If people stopped chasing him, he would drag his feet as before, his eyes fixed, and not care about anything around him. If there was anything edible on the street, like vegetable leaves, he would pick it up and eat it. When he needed to defecate, he would defecate. When he needed to sleep, he would find a place to sleep and lie down anywhere—everything that makes a person a person had been extinguished, leaving only the simplest biological movements. If someone hit him, he would never fight back, just drag his feet and run away. If someone chased him, he would just walk faster. If people stopped chasing him, he would drag his feet as before, his eyes fixed, and not care about anything around him. Once, my old nanny was coming back from the market early in the morning with a basket, when one of these bums suddenly snatched a live fish from her. He ran a few steps and started gnawing on the raw fish like a hungry dog. The nanny chased after him, but he put the fish in his arms and pretended to be innocent. The nanny said to him: "I know you are hungry, but eating raw fish will make you sick, and it will be difficult to explain to the owner. Give it back to me, and I will give you money." When the bum saw the money, he took the live fish out of his arms, seemingly with a little sense of humor.</p>
<p>Let's talk about another morning with biting cold winds and interwoven rain and snow. I was walking along Fuzhou Road in the city and saw four or five beggar children sitting on the cement floor under an archway, hugging each other to keep warm. The scene was quite affectionate, and the meaning was quite different from the young women in dance halls hugging each other to dance. I firmly believe that the world would definitely be at peace if people and countries could be as affectionate as these beggar children. Not far past, next to an iron gate, I saw another pile of beggar children, about a dozen, all under the age of eight or nine. Maybe their minds were already adults, or maybe their actual age was over ten, but because of insufficient material conditions, the bodies given to them by heaven had their physiological development delayed by a few years compared to ordinary people. They were lined up in two neat rows, the back of the person in front pressed tightly against the chest of the person behind. They sat upright on the ground in the wind and snow, still fast asleep. It was truly the so-called "poor people have their own ways." They slept like this, the person behind becoming the pillow and mattress of the person in front, and the person in front becoming the quilt and blanket of the person behind. This truly became "relying on each other for life," and each life was combined into one life in the wind and snow. This pile of beggar children had nothing in the world except the warmth between them. In ancient times, there was something called a "meat screen," which this was probably similar to. Seeing this pile of beggar children, I finally realized the true meaning of the ancient saying "stranded carp moisten each other with breath and saliva." But today, some people are still "standing on the swamp, looking after the swans and deer," which is probably the so-called "forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes."</p>
<p>This truly corresponds to a passage in Hugo's "Les Misérables": "You (the rich) must check the weather records in the newspapers to know if the weather is cold. We don't have to look at thermometers. We ourselves are thermometers! We can feel the blood in our blood vessels congealing, and feel the ice as if it has touched our hearts."</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Such a Fine Evening (27)</p>
<p>Bin Qi suddenly received the news that Qi Ren was about to leave Beiping. Not only had his mission been completed, but after receiving the letter, he rushed back that night. After getting off the train, he went straight to Xiaochang Hutong without even going home. He rang the doorbell, and Little Wang Ma opened the door. When she saw that it was Zhu Zhai, she was overjoyed and shouted: "Oh! Mr. Xu has really come back! The boss said: 'The train will arrive at this time, it must be him coming back,' but I didn't believe it..." As she spoke, she turned around to report. Zhu Zhai quickly stopped her and said: "Don't be so excited, let me sneak in and give her a surprise, a smile!" Little Wang Ma covered her mouth with one hand and giggled, saying: "Okay, okay!" The two of them tiptoed in. Just as they reached the courtyard, they heard Qi Ren asking from inside the room: "Is that Mr. Xu?" Little Wang Ma replied: "No, it's the mailman." Then they heard a sigh from inside the room saying: "If he doesn't come at this time, he won't be able to come back today!" She sighed twice more—Zhu Zhai couldn't help but rush up the stairs. Little Wang Ma rushed one step ahead and lifted the door curtain, smiling and shouting: "Boss, look, who is this?" She giggled as she spoke. At this time, Zhu Zhai had just stepped over the threshold, and Qi Ren, lying on the bed, had already seen him at a glance. She threw off the blanket covering her body, revealing her bright red pajamas, got out of bed in a flash, slipped on her slippers, rushed to Zhu Zhai, and held his hand tightly, saying: "Zhu, you're back!" Zhu Zhai smiled slightly, seeing her dressed in bright red pajamas, bright red slippers, with her beautiful hair scattered, which further highlighted the beauty of her bright eyes. He immediately put his hands on her shoulders, his eyes fixed on her face, constantly looking at her. Seeing him looking at her like this, Qi Ren turned her face away and said with a smile: "Don't you recognize me?" Zhu Zhai carefully looked at her face. After a while, he put both hands on her shoulders and shook them, saying: "Excellent! Excellent! I was most worried about the scar on your face. Now there is not a trace of it, it's truly gratifying!" Qi Ren pouted her small mouth very shyly and said: "It's not gone, I still have a small bump on my arm, it's very annoying!" As she spoke, she lifted the sleeve of her pajamas, revealing her snow-white arm, pointing to a small red dot on her arm and said, all my wounds have healed, only this one festered. It didn't get better after many days of treatment. Later, Dr. Wei examined it and found a piece of broken glass inside. It only closed after removing it, and now there is a small red bump left, how annoying!" Zhu Zhai stroked the small bump with his hand and said: "I don't think it's annoying at all. A small red bump on your snow-white arm makes it look more beautiful." Qi Ren twisted her delicate body and said: "You're just joking with me!" Zhu Zhai said: "Really, this arm of yours, as white as snow, with a small red bean dot, is called "Snow Wrapped in Red"." Qi Ren shook off Zhu Zhai's hand and pretended to be angry, saying: "Then, I've become dried vegetables!" Zhu Zhai laughed heartily. Just then, Little Wang Ma had already brought a hot towel and handed it to Zhu Zhai with a fragrant finger. Zhu Zhai wiped his face and rinsed his mouth with tea. Only then did Qi Ren pull him to sit side by side on a sofa. Zhu Zhai asked: "Why do you want to leave Beiping?" Qi Ren said: "I wrote so many letters, hoping you would come back, but you never came back!"</p>
<h3>Rejected</h3>
<p>— Chou Sheng</p>
<p>Of course, the person who submits a manuscript is unhappy when he receives a rejection from the editor. But the editor is often equally uncomfortable when sending this rejection letter—who wants to hurt someone's feelings for no reason? And it is very difficult to write a rejection letter that is very tactful.</p>
<p>But according to an American writer, Vincent Starrett, Chinese editors are the best at the art of rejection!</p>
<p>Starrett's new book "Books and Two-Legged Animals" says: The Chinese are good at saving face, and editors are especially good at it. Then he gave an example of a rejection letter. The letter said: "We have read your manuscript in a group and are overjoyed beyond measure. We swear to the spirits of our ancestors that we have never read such a brilliant work. If we publish your manuscript, we will certainly not be able to publish any books in the future that are of a lower standard than this book. And your work is so sublime that, obviously, it is impossible to produce works of the same standard in the next ten thousand years. Therefore, we are very sorry that we have to return this supreme and sacred masterpiece to you. We offer you a thousand apologies and ask for your forgiveness!"</p>
<h3>The Sichuanese Dog Barks at Yao</h3>
<p>— By Bai Wuwen, Drawing by Long Sheng</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Lin Yutang once drew an illustration, "Beating a Dog in the Water," for an article in the "Yu Si" of the Beijing Times. The main idea of the article was: even though a dog has fallen into the water, it must still be beaten mercilessly. The reason is that dogs know how to swim; if you don't beat it, once it gets ashore, it will shake water all over you and continue to attack you, barking and even biting.</p>
<p>There are quite a few dogs in Chongqing, especially stray dogs. When we night workers pass through each dark alley, many ferocious ones with big tails follow and bark madly, as if they are heroes performing their duty of guarding the night. But in reality, they are just stray dogs, guarding the alley but not the door. For example, in the alley where I live, thieves pry open doors several times a month, but the heroes remain silent as usual. On the other hand, the nearsighted Editor Wang, who returns home late from the opposite door, is often bitten, dripping with blood.</p>
<p>The proliferation of dogs in Chongqing is due less to the lack of strict management as in other cities, resulting in a state of anarchy, and more to the tolerance of the people towards dogs. In Hong Kong during the occupation, the old Irish Setters, German Shepherds, and Pekingese of the British and Americans were mostly eaten by the Chinese. The owners had already been imprisoned in concentration camps. There are not few starving people in Chongqing today, but they would rather snatch sesame cakes from the stalls than think about killing dogs. This is related to customs. A friend of mine, during the severe famine in Sichuan in 1936, went up the river from Chongqing to inspect various counties along the Jialing River and administer emergency relief. He saw disaster victims eating Guanyin earth and green oak leaves, while the stray dogs were all very fat and strong, because they had better food sources. The corpses of the starved were chewed up by them, increasing their nutrition and making them fat and well-fed. He asked them—the disaster victims—why they didn't eat dog meat. They replied: eating dog meat will lead to hell and prevent reincarnation. I then felt the greatness of the power of superstition. When people don't choose their food, using tree bark and grass roots to eke out a living, they will give up available food, even delicacies, for fear of hell, and would rather entrust their lives to unimaginable white mud and clay, so the dogs can eat them and grow strong.</p>
<p>Every day I see those people who come to beg for food, and I preach to them, advising them to kill dogs. What is strange is that the story of Mulian saving his mother—slaughtering dogs to break the fast—has taken root in the minds of farmers, while the story of Lu Zhishen, who got drunk and beat the mountain gate and ate dog meat, is far less popular than the former. Even if we talk about karma, isn't the flower monk who eliminated the evil tyrants in order to save people truly a compassionate Bodhisattva worthy of worship?</p>
<h3>Reservation Fee</h3>
<p>— By Fang Ren</p>
<p>During the autumn semester's start, I struggled to raise a small sum for tuition, and it seems I still have many debts to clear. Unexpectedly, yesterday my child came home from school and took out a notice from his bag, urging us to pay the "reservation fee." The child, being ignorant, kept urging me to pay the money quickly, otherwise, his spot would be taken by someone else, and he wouldn't be able to study. When I heard this, I realized how much their teacher was scaring the ignorant children for this little bit of money. But for me, I could only comfort him gently, assuring him that Daddy would take care of it and not to worry.</p>
<p>In fact, Daddy's responsibilities have already reached an unbearable point. This semester's tuition for elementary school is 500,000 yuan, and next semester it will be no less than one million or more. Moreover, the younger children will also have to enroll, which would require two to three million yuan. Not to mention that I have no idea where to get this money, even the "reservation fee" that they are urging me to pay now, although only two hundred thousand yuan or so, will take a lot of effort to raise.</p>
<p>Speaking of the "reservation fee" system, it seems to be only practiced in a corner of Shanghai, and it is clearly unreasonable. The school authorities' excuse for collecting the "reservation fee" is supposedly to facilitate planning the number of new students to admit, but this argument is very far-fetched. Because, if you must have parents express their opinions on whether their children will continue their studies next semester, there are many ways other than money! Even if you must use money to obtain credit, there is no need to collect it so early, giving parents time to consider—whether to continue educating their children, transfer them to another school, or simply drop out!</p>

<p>Telegram Q&amp;A: Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Office</p>
<p>[Patron asks]: It is very inconvenient to send international telegrams from the western district. Can a branch office be set up near Nanjing West Road? (International Radio Station answers) According to the standards set by the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, a branch office can only be established if there are at least 600 outgoing telegrams per month. This station has calculated that the number of outgoing telegrams in the Nanjing West Road area each month is not enough to meet this standard, so there are no plans to set up a business office there at this time. Please understand. If you find it inconvenient to send telegrams because of the distance, please call (1120) between 10:00 AM and 8:00 PM to notify this station to send someone to collect them. No additional fees will be charged other than the telegram fee, but this is limited to those who pay in cash for the telegram.</p>
<p>[Liu Shibao of East Zhongzheng Road asks]: I am always satisfied with the thoughtful service of the picture bureau, but I have two things to ask for clarification. Is it difficult to get the outgoing telegram paper? Is there a solution? My small business intends to register a telegraphic code to facilitate telegrams from out-of-town customers, but so far I have been unable to register it. Why? (Answer) There are many people who ask for outgoing telegram paper every day, and sometimes there are slight restrictions to avoid waste. If your business has many outgoing telegrams, you can send a letter to the business department of this bureau to request a full book of outgoing telegram paper. This bureau has added 30,000 Chinese telegraphic codes since this month and should not be short of codes in the future. You are free to register.</p>
