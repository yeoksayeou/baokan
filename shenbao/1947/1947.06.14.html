<h3>選舉總事務所　委員名單公布　成立日期倘未確定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕選舉總事務所全體委員名單，業經國府正式公布。洪蘭友十三日語記者，成立日期尚未確定，惟成立後第一步將成立各省分事務所，各分所委員人選仍按照總事務所人事分配辦理，由各黨分任。最後，洪氏對各方所提之比例代表制一點，表示不能贊同，因選舉法規上，並無此項規定，實不合民主精神也。</p>
<h3>西藏色拉寺　衝突已結束</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕最近西職政變，熱振被殺，復引起邊疆民族間題之紛爭，惟此一度紊亂之局勢業吿平靜，但據西藏班禪駐京辦事處人士語記者，此種事件雖已成為過去，但仍可不斷發生，似甚引為隱慮。記者復訪蒙藏委會負賣人，探詢此事經過，承稱：西藏政府於四月中將攝政熱振呼圖克圍逮捕入獄，同時并派軍隊圍攻色拉寺，蒙藏委會聞悉此項消息後，經電西藏當局，以色拉走為佛敎聖地不容摧毀，應即和平解訣，并將詳情自報，旋據西藏政府於四月廿九日電復，因前任攝政熱振企圖謀害現任攝政達扎呼圖克圖，故將執熱振及關係車大歡人拘禁，色拉寺無知僧衆附和熱振，反抗政府，經西藏僧俗民衆大會一致同意加以賣罰，並無摧毀寺廟情事，所有中央在藏學員及旅藏漢商均當切實保護等語。近聞熱振業已在獄病故，色拉寺軍事衝突已吿結束，地方秩序亦已恢復。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕關於西藏事件，記者曾訪有關人士，承談：政府亟採取下列數項辦法，以為處理，（一）迅派大員入藏宣慰，而安人心，（二）開展近邊藏區工作，（三）促進藏中各項建設，（四）加强青。康兩省建設等，認為如忽略以上各點，藏事將仍不絕如縷，親英派與親漢派間之關係，將續有演變。</p>
<h3>北塔山相持</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化十三日電〕北塔山戰事，現正相持中。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕蘇駐華大使彼德羅夫返國述職期，已定於本月下旬內，渠於離京前，定十七日下午六時至八時在大使館內舉行酒會，招待各國使節，我方首長及各界。</p>
<h3>聯合國機構人士　注視新疆事件　關切我是否提出申訴</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十二日電〕聯合國人士對國際社自南京發出關於中國可能向聯合國申訴外蒙部隊侵犯新疆一節之報導，極為注意，然官方並未加以評論。非官方人士立即臆測，如中國確有此行動，則其是否將以安理會常任理事國之地位，否決外蒙加入聯合國之申請，蓋安全理事會即將審查外蒙之申請，而安理會與大會之聯合委會，刻復正討論聯合國會籍之程序事項也。聯合國秘署處安理會事務部拒絕評論此項報道，但國際社報導，使此間人士對新疆局勢，更為關切，尤其鑒於另一報道內稱，新疆北部奇合地方，數月以前，曾發現　礦。此消息如屬實，則將直接牽涉致大於國際管制原子能計劃之國際原子能委會。</p>
<h3>發動新疆事件　旨在試探美國　世界電訊報評論稱</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕斯克利浦斯，霍華德系世界電訊報，頃首先對新疆事件發表評論，聲稱，新疆之被侵，端在探測其他大國（包括美國在內）對此種事態之反響如何。該報表示，今日之世界，即須作「主義之選擇」，一為杜魯門主義，另一為希特勒及舉索里尼主義，後者之結果，「僅為世界之混亂與災禍」。該報評論舶下，大規模戰爭來臨時，並非如晴天之霹雷，其起因實係漸次醞釀而成。</p>
<h3>北方行紀之二　失去彈性的沙發</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>北平是一隻沙發，是一隻失去了彈性的沙發。它給與人的感覺還是舒適，可長躺在上面總有點不對勁，它的內部彈簧鬆弛了。睽違十二年，這一次我從它深深地領略到這一滋味。</p>
<p>為什麼它是一隻沙發呢？</p>
<p>假使你沒有機會在低空的飛機上俯瞰北平，你跑上景山，縱目四眺，你就知道這個城市不僅是全中國最美麗的城市了。何思源市長說：四個字—正大光明可以形容北平市，前門對後門，東門對西門，筆直，整個城子方方正正，屋宇街道寬大，每戶人家都有院落—四合院子，充滿了陽光。市工務局技正李頌深先生也盛讚北平為全世界最優良的六格形城市，與最新式都市計劃的條件吻合，即（一）都市園林化，（二）建築富創造力，（三）住宅鄰近商店。這是個起居憩止的好天地哩一</p>
<p>北海漪瀾堂，中山公園的來今雨軒或上林春，喝喝茶：長安街，王府井大街，蹓蹺蹓　；東安市塲，琉璃廠，淘淘舊書攤古董舖，太平花，牡丹花，芍藥花，荷花，菊花，一季有一季的花卉，儘有欣賞的好去處；沙鍋居白肉，西來順涮鍋子，全聚德烤鴨，喫不勝喫。而人又都是那麼誠懇樸實，空氣又都是那麼寗靜亢爽。</p>
<p>為什麼它又是失去了彈性呢？</p>
<p>一言以蔽之，景物依然，人事全非，貧窮使這個城子喪失活力，萎靡癱瘓。北平市有一百六十幾萬人口。而百分之八十是失業的或不事生產者，在那個百分之二十中，四分之三又是薪給收入者，在令天物價奔竄不已的經濟情况下，這個城子市民的生活狀態，我們是不難想像的了。北平流行着「三上吊」這句話，意思是指無房可住，無事可做，米糧太貴，每一件都可以逼得人們上吊的。我在北平勾留的那幾天中，報紙上幾乎每天都有自殺的新聞。北方人性格敎厚樸直，活不下去就自殺，這種馴順的方式雖可鄰可哀，我們能勿視這種無言控訴所呈現的嚴重影響嗎？</p>
<p>電車公司因為虧累不堪，上月份收支不數約三億餘，公司當局打算加價，但鑒於上次加價後的乘客銳减，嚇得不敢在加價上轉念頭了。因為乘客銳减，結果反使收入减少。洋車，三輪車也是同樣的情形，東城到西城，最高的東費沒有超過三千元的，車夫們祗好輄緊牙齒讓車價與物價風馬牛，兩不相及，他們知道，少拉幾個錢總比無人過問的好。凡此現象，說明了一般大家的貧窮，他們盡可能地把自已生活水準壓低到最低最低級位。有一天，假使他們連窩窩頭，棒子麵都喫不到時，變故就難免了。有個朋友說：「反饑餓」的口號，在北平應該是車夫們提出的。</p>
<p>原來北平無工業，也可以說是無商業，完全是個消費的城布。</p>
<p>假使勉强來說，從十五年到二十六年，手工業曾有過一段輝煌歷史，在對外貿易上也佔居相當數字，它包括有地氈花邊，刺繡，銅錫器，玉器等八種手工業。但現在，能有這種餘情餘力的人畢竟少了，交通更窒息了它的生機。東單牌樓的地攤，天橋的古玩市塲，許多東西便宜到和一般物價不成其比例，即使如此，還是門前冷落車馬稀，購買這些閒情逸緻的東西究竟不若購買幾袋麵粉必要。</p>
<p>沒有工業，商業便成為一面倒的祇是供應消費，且因地理關係，也不是轉遝碼頭。一位金融機關的主持人吿訴我，他的業務收入連維持這個單位的每月經常開支都不够。他又說，北平商人很守信用，很穩健，他們絕不冒險，倒賬的事絕無僅有。比方做押款，在上海有五千萬貨物的商人，可以採取連環套押的方法，做出囤積一億五千美元貨物的市面來，北平商人明明知道這個方法，但他們絕不這樣做。</p>
<p>貧困，剝蝕了購買力，降低了生活水準，迫使大家在饑餓綫上掙扎。戴着五色繽紛的面紗的女子，雖然仍舊成羣結隊地飛馳於東單，西單一帶，西直門外駱駝隊的鈴聲，雖然仍舊那樣的悠邏，紅牆黃瓦綠樹雖然仍舊在陽光下閃爍着彩色；……人的生活內容起了顯著的變化了。</p>
<p>沙發還是沙發，缺少了彈性，那舒適也是極有限度的。</p>
<h3>白崇禧暫緩飛新　政院檢討會聽取新疆事件報告　蘇蒙對我抗議尚未答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國防部長白崇禧赴新疆日期。迄十三日尚未能決定，准十四日或克成行。據悉，白崇禧原定十二日飛新，嗣因接獲張治中來電謂，當地可能解決此事，乃展緩行期，現已再電張治中商洽，故啓程期當在接獲張之覆電以後，由於白崇禧延期成行，致首都十三日有改派參謀次長劉斐之說，此事殊難置信，蓋中樞重視此事，初不以係邊境事件而改變觀點也。此間人士咸信政府有確保邊疆之決心，十三日晨政院舉行檢討會議時，白祟禧，王世杰均出廣報吿，會中各政委對新局交換意見，惟不作任何決定。據有關方面訊，北塔山事件眞相，現正逐漸判明，民族問題似為其　結所在，而中蘇條約有關外蒙張界部份之漏洞，則為其爆發事件之主因。新疆旅京人士對此事將有意見發表，或係採取吿新疆民衆書之形式，書內聲明兩點，其一為關於外蒙軍侵新事件之態度，另一為擁護中央贊成麥斯武德主新，要求全新團結，固我邊土。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕新疆事件發生後，我外部曾同時向蘇蒙雙方提出抗機，惟截至十三日止，覆文迄未到達，又外部方面對派員赴新事，拒絕有所宣布。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕記者頃就新疆事件訪參政會秘長部力子，請發表感想。邵氏稱，此乃邊疆衝突事件，不致擴大如外間傳播之嚴重。張治中在新處理甚佳，今後仍持和緩態度，當不致有問題也。邵氏認為：此次事件可望於短期內解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕天山學會為外蒙軍入侵新疆事，十三日電呈將主席，並通電全國，要求政府採取合理措施。電文經該會十三日理監事臨時會議通過，新籍立委華聲慕·貿祿等，均為該會理事，會員多新疆籍人土。通電提出四項措施，請政府採納：（一）增强情銳武裝力量，保衛領土，（二）採用强硬外交，制止侵略，（三）依據伊犁和平條款，聲隔伊犁塔城阿山地方部隊，派遣國軍擴收該三區邊區防務，（四）必要時向聯合國安全理事會提出控訴。又全國婦女團體聯誼會，十三日晨集會，討論新疆問題，並決定（一）發動全國婦女，一致反對侵略，（二）聯絡全國各界，支援政府，（三）發動首都各界舉行反侵略運動，十四日晨再行義會，並發表宣言。</p>

<h3>旅大視察團返抵瀋　視察結果即向中樞報告　蘇仍拒絕國軍開入旅大</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕旅大視察團一行，由董彥平率領，十二日晨乘專車由葫產島北駛，中午過錦州，下午六時返抵瀋。該團於三日抵旅，十二日離旅，住蘇軍招待所中十日，除七日，十日先後兩批赴大連視察，當日即　返外，餘均在旅順逗留。視察分社會·港口·及中長路三組，蘇軍負招持及保護之實。實地視察較少，一般多由遲子祥以地方負責人士資格作口頭報吿。（遞氏為關東行署主席）。由僅有一次在市塲被人民包圍作小談，故該圖頗以未能與人民親切接觸引為憾事。據某團員稱：旅大市面齊條，糧荒好轉。該地蘇軍司令官為白羅卜羅托夫上將。</p>
<p>又關於視察旅大結果，將由董彥平於日內飛京報吿中央。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕據接近外交部方而消息，蘇聯政府已拒絕允許政府軍隊之開入大連與旅順，蘇聯政府正故意遷延中國之接收旅大。</p>
<p>據稱，一九四五年十月，即日本投降後二月，中國政府曾通知蘇聯稱，中國官員將隨帶軍隊由海道前往旅大往依當時之情形，僅有海道可通，但蘇聯拒絕由海道前往，亦未舉出理由，而建議可由陸上前往，蘇聯當時亦明知陸上路綫之不可能。此後中國政府即接獲可靠情報稱，在旅大附近有反政府武裝部隊之存在。</p>
<p>本年三月七日，蘇聯通知中國稱，蘇聯準備移交旅大二地之行政，中國政府遂於三月卅一日提出答覆，詳述使中國展延接收之理由，並闡明中國政府之新計劃，當然包括派遣軍隊問題在內。為保護行政人員之安全起見，軍隊之派遣列屬必要，蓋知旅大附近已在共軍包圍之中，中國政府不願見及哈爾濱事件之重現。嗣後曾經數次折徊，蘇聯迄今仍堅決反對國軍之開入旅大，使中國無恢復該地行政權之可能云。</p>

<p>〔中央社柏林十二日電〕衛立煌將軍單獨接見中央社記者時稱：中國若欲能與渠所訪問之諸國並駕齊驅，則在加强及現代化中國國防事業上，尚有衆多事項，亟待完成。渠並舉法國為例謂：法國需從頭作起，但法國裝備及訓練武器部隊之成績至佳，英美二國，亦實行普遍軍訓，即比利時亦在加强軍隊之訓練及國防工作。渠並吿記者：俟返國後，將以此行所得詳細報告政府，並將對增强與現代化國防之工作，提出若干建議。衛氏並稱：渠所訪問之各國，似均無意隱藏任何秘密。渠認為各該國所以任吾人目覩各植事物者，或因渠等知悉即予吾人以藍圖樣本，吾人亦尚無法製作此種秘密設計之武器也。衛氏一行，原擬訪問中東各國，刻決定於訪問德國後，即取道美國返國。</p>
<h3>美茶葉公會報告　茶價將上漲　惟華輸出難復舊觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕據美國茶葉公會報吿：茶業零售價格，由於成本及全球缺貨之故，可能上漲，唯茶葉仍屬最低康之飲料。該報吿檢討全球戰後情形及美國國內茶葉市塲稱：全球茶葉產量，目前無提高之可能，故售價亦將上漲，以反映成本之增加，除非錫蘭，印度，荷印，中，日各國恢復戰前之產量，否則茶價決無下降之可能。美國茶業之零售價格，日後亦上漲，茶葉雖無國際管制，然數年後全球之所產茶，將供不應求，蓋所有主要產茶國家之茶園戰時均遭受重大損害也，印度錫蘭及日本茶之瞻望雖佳，然華茶由於政治不定及經濟紊亂之故，自該國抗戰以還，已低落百分之七十，此外中國種茶者，在培植焙製及推銷方面，方法均屬陳舊，而台灣「烏龍茶」之主要產區茶偎，較國際市塲上之價格尤高，因之華茶早日恢復戰前輸出數量之瞻望益見黯淡。</p>

<h3>解除外匯管制與搶救當前經濟危機芻議</h3>
<p>今春以還，物價波動加劇，間歇時期縮短，這一現象，正是說明了經濟危機已日趨深刻，差不多瀕臨崩潰的邊綠。時機如此緊急，實在不允許我們從容商討，或是亂走方向，再岡補救，我們應該立刻拿出確切的辦法，立刻見諸行動。所以對於當前經濟的危機，我們主張趕快搶救。回憶去冬輸入許可制實施之初，原欲藉以揖節外匯，同時消除傾鎖的威脅；今春經濟緊急措施，禁止金鈔買賣與流通，共最大目的，也是在於根除或至少减輕經濟動盪的騷擾因素。孰料施行結果，適與所期相反，經濟動盪如故，而且有加甚之勢。輸入限制，傾銷儒之稍止，然而走私之風，反形大盛，而原料輸入倒眞正受了限制，影饗所及，工業生產非但未有改善，反因原料缺乏，陷於停頓。戰後物資，原本缺乏，如無輸入以為調節，則缺乏自將加重，因而更助長物價的漲風。外匯配結名為加緊管制，而黑匯始終未嘗絕跡。調劑盈虛，供求相應，本是經濟上極自然的事實，今乃不事疏導，不予扶助，一憑行政壓力，豈不償事？僑匯逃走了，出口阻滯了，外匯沒有來源，政府如何供應？經濟上的僵局，造成政治上的苦悶。於是議論紛紛，藥石亂投，更增了許多紛擾。</p>
<p>或說今日經濟危機的造成，是由於內戰，內戰不停，則沒法解除經濟危機，我們自也不能完全否認這一說法；不過，將經濟政治攪在一起，把今日經濟的僵局，全部推在政治身上，亦頗有商榷的餘地。就拿我們研究經濟的眼光看，目前中國的經濟，果施策得當，執行澈底，還是有辦法，而經濟僵局一旦打開，政治苦悶至少可望局部解除。當然，我們並不是說經濟問題解決了，一切問題都可迎刃而解，但是我們認為在一切問題解決之先，就經濟而言經濟，亦不是完全沒有辦法。</p>
<p>目前經濟危機的嚴重，一般都認爲財政失衡是根本的問題。我們也得相對的同意這。說法，但財政經濟密切連擊，而經濟實為財政的根源，如果單單注視財政，而忽略了經濟，這是捨本逐末的辦法。財政攻支應該平衡，這是天經地義的情理，但無視經濟而單在平衡下工夫，惟有竭澤而漁！於此，我們可說，除非經濟有辦法，財政是沒有出路，也可以說，今日努力之途，經濟第一，則政其次。</p>
<p>人人都知道，當前中國經濟的危機，在於物資的普遍缺乏，生產不振，進口停頓，而我們財政經濟政策之主入歧途，使形勢更形惡化。亡羊補牢，尙未爲晚。我們不欲侈談理論，在這裏簡簡單單的寫出幾點建議。我們認為當前經濟危機已到非搶救不可的境地，希望我們的建議，能够引起注意。</p>
<p>（一）外匯交易應腦恢復自由現行出口結匯辦法，應即廢止，使出口不復受結匯規定的約束，而允許其將所得的外匯自由向市塲出售，則出口停頓的狀態，即能打開，而走私的怪現象，亦可不再表演。惟為防止藉輸出以逃避資本，出口雖不須結匯，但仍須有登記的手續，俾能證明所有出口外匯用以輸入物資，或出售與進口商。進口商所需外匯，中央銀行亦不必再為勉强供給，可任其向市塲收購，則目前的麻煩請匯手續，與時間的躭擱損失，均可免除。交易自由，進出口商均惑便利，輸入貿易旣有出口外匯以供應，必需品的進口，即能重行展開。</p>
<p>（二）貿易仍須酌加管制外匯開放後，貿易仍須酌加管制；否則，去年放任的弊病，又將重演。將輸入商品嚴格分類，並在輸入前，繼續採行許可措置，如奢侈品與非必需品的輸入，仍應限制或禁止，惟於必需品的進口，則應儘量放鬆。如此，則所有出口外匯始可集中運用於必需品的進口，旣可增加國內工業原料的供應，解除一般物資的缺乏恐慌，復能避免外貨的再為傾銷，影響國內民族工業；外匯循此自然趨勢，國際收支自可日趨接近，亦即能有助匯認的穩定。</p>
<p>（三）匯率不必再作硬性釘住目前法幣對外價值的自然水準，尚難確切獲致，不宜驟作硬性的釘住。匯率的硬性釘住，我們沒有足量的外匯資金，怎能維特？與莫名亦實亡，不若素性開放。開放後的匯率，宜隨貿易收支與物價的變動，任其自動調整。如是出口與僑匯的收入，可不受釘住影響，逐漸增加，亦能有助匯率的穩定。惟中央銀有到外匯市塲的正當交易，仍須採取干涉政策，以平準供需的均衡，而兔季節或特殊的不必要波動。但此種干涉措置，不必另設機構，公開活動，仍可由中央銀行來執行，在暗中以調節。且對不合理匯率，不宜強作維持，而應助其尋覓自然水準，在自然水準上的不必要波動，遂須予以阻止。如在獲得自然水準後，匯率發生猛漲，中央銀行可在暗中供給；反之，如起暴落，則中央銀行應即收購。如在自然水準上的輕微波動，亦可任其自然，不必干涉。如是，中央銀行旣可以少額外匯，平準供應的均衡，而維持較長期的穩定。</p>
<p>（四）對外資流動應予便利外匯開放後，對資本逃避的支出，固須設法阻止，但於外資的收回和利潤的流歸，則須給以便利。今後經濟的復興和建設，端賴外資的流入，即目前國際歸，應予便利。予外資以流動自由，雖將加重匯率壓力，但在今外商對華商業重建之時，相信外資流入必能遠超流出之數，故於此點，亦不必過慮。但為防止狡黠者覓隙逃資，故於外資匯出前，亦須經許可手續。</p>
<p>貿易管制，外匯又管制，如此雙重的管制，弄得貿易阻塞，生產停頓。貿易需要管制，這是工業一洛後國家應有的措施，旣有了貿易管制，又何必再來一個請匯結匯的辦法。現今政府的所以釘住外匯，同時不准自由結匯，最大理由，在於避免匯率上升，刺激國內物價上漲，但是目前的事實，官價外匯雖儒釘住，　匯依然波動，助因貿易阻塞，更加甚物價波動，所以此種理由，已難成立。至於我們所主張的開放外匯，如若實行，則可收下列的效果：（一）出口價格問題解決，出口數量可增加，進口貿易亦可賴以重展。（二）　匯不必再走黑市，可以自行輸入物資，或出售與進口商以輸入物資。（三）已經逃外之資金，可重新獲得機會，以購買物資進口的方式流向。（四）可吸引一部份的外資，來彌補國際收支平衡上的差額。兩者相較之下，政府不必再爲顧慮。為今之計，故請政府應快開放外匯市塲，搶救當前經濟危機。</p>

<h3>法商電車公共汽車小風潮　一度停駛旋即恢復　原因爲工會代表受辱動衆怒　張金海慘案主角成衆矢之的</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商電車及紅色公共汽車，於昨日下午一時半，因法商水電公司車務處高級職員郭士元侮辱工會代表，紛紛進廠停駛，表示抗議，並要求公司將郭開革，工人情緒甚爲憤激。事發後，嵩山警察分局宋局長親率警士至盧家灣維持秩序，市社會局總工會得訊均派員前往調解，於下午五時五十分，工人接受勸導，先行復工，各路電車公共汽車恢復行駛。</p>
<p>該案起因，綠有法商二十四路無軌電車二六八號賣票楊道生，於本月九日因本市暴風雨，電車乘客甚少，趁閒在福煦路西摩路車站上與公司派駐該站之五十四號寫票（非工人係職員）戲謔，不料因此結寃，五十四號即於當日簽呈報吿公司，謂二六八號有「先打鐘後關門」等失職情事。公司根據此報吿，將二六八號罰薪一天。翌日二六八號向五十四號交涉，發生衝突，公司乃將二六八號開除。工會得訊，於昨日上午十時派代表一八八號等十餘人往公司車務處詢問開除二六八號理由，該處高級職員郭士元稱：公司對二六八號之開除，無商量餘地。後經工會代表直接向總經理交涉，公司當局允將二六八號留任，收回開除成命。代表等乃轉向郭士元質問。據工會方面稱：郭非惟不承認工會代表，且出手槍恐嚇侮辱。一時羣情憤怒，立將車務處辦公室搗毀。郭則因有工會代表保護，幸未受傷。下午一時半許行駛各路電車汽車職工聞訊，紛紛駕車回廠，形成罷工狀態。</p>
<h3>臨時大會提出三項要求</h3>
<p>工人開臨時大會，決議三項要求：（一）開除郭士元水不錄用。（二）修改職務章程。（三）公司以後招雇新員工，應採取考試制度。並因郭士元即係八年前本市法租界時期張金海慘死案中之主角，（郭當時開設藝華洗衣公司，現改爲綢緞公司）故工人亦提出要求重審張案之口號。經各方面勸導後，公司當局允於問題未解決前令郭士元休假數天，俾便進行調查，一俟査明事實，公司必秉公處理。</p>
<h3>糧貸案審結候判　徐寄廎奚玉書到案作證　對官商勾結等均無所聞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之糧貸舞弊案，前經地檢處以違反非常時期農礦工商條例起訴，移送地院審理。該案昨晨在地院開辯論庭審結，吳象祖庭長，偕推事黃光鈺，吳榮林，檢察官張元鎭，書記官孫垣升座後，提被吿在押之糧官汪達人，糧商王巽之，莊漢章，吳蓉生，在保之糧官任星厓，糧商萬墨林，邢志剛，楊潤會到庭審訊，並傳徐寄庼，奚玉書到庭作證。昨日審訊時間頗長，自上午九時半至中午一時許始畢，末諭本案辯論終結，定十八日上午十時宣判。</p>
<p>審訊生心　注意三項</p>
<p>昨日審訊重心，爲調査官商之間有無勾結情形，貸與糧商款項除規定利息三分外有無黑市利息，曁介紹糧商有無收受手續費情形等三項。被吿等供詞與前三次相同，嗣傳證人前糧貸審核小組委員會市商會代表徐寄庼稱：「去年春初，本市米荒甚烈，當時各團體遂有請糧食部購辦米糧之議，後經宋院長，徐部長，曁本市吳市長，吳局長等，會同各團體領袖商議結果，決定舉辦糧貸，先由市商會保薦八家，再由豆米業公會理事長萬墨林推舉八家，共十六家米號。當時糧貸審核小組委員會之職權，是決定各項原則，審核貸款糧商資格等。汪達人係該委員會主席，但審査時無權決定一切，未聞有收介紹費，審核費等名目，除親定利息三分外，未聞有所謂黑市利息，官商勾結情形，並無所聞。至於辦理糧貸原屬善策，若能維持至今，米價或不至如此高漲。」</p>
<p>產區價漲　影響滬市</p>
<p>繼傳另一證人奚玉書，據稱：「本人是代表參議會參加糧貸審核小組會議，該項糧貸，係爲本市各界領袖發動，旨在採購食米，救濟本市民食恐慌。當時並考慮若僅向無錫一地採購，則無錫米價必漲，故分別指定常熟。松江等地區。我們建議政府貸款三十億元，先採購十萬石，揚糧政特派員向糧政部，財政部請示結果，僅允撥二十億元，先撥十億元，致該款祗購米三萬石，與原定計劃相產甚遠。米商至採購地區後，產米區米價即行上漲，影響所及，本市之米價，亦隨之上漲，此乃必然結果，實非糧貸之罪。監督糧政人員係糧政部之實，糧貸審核小組委會無此職權。至於有無官商勾結，收取黑市利息，曁手續費等情形，均無所聞。」</p>
<p>律師辯稱　應予赦免</p>
<p>檢察官論吿中有：「本案除依違反非常時期晨礦工商條例起訴外，如審判長發現被吿等其他罪行，亦可依其他法條審判。」此語引起被吿律師之反駁，略謂：「按刑事訴訟法第二四四條，如有其他罪行，應追加起訴，今檢察官並未追加起訴，按刑事訴訟法二四七條法院不得就未經起訴之犯罪審判。至於被告等係依違反非常時期農礦工商條例起訴，遵照國府元旦頒佈之大赦令，均在赦免之列，應請鈞院諭知被吿等爲無罪之判決。」</p>

<h3>戰前工資不合理　吳開先談工人待遇　同情工人有之　不承認是袒護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨與記者談：自生活指數解凍後，至今零星糾紛甚多，但相信不致有大問題發生。對市商會工業協會要求將工資恢復至二十五年底薪事，吳局長表示二十五年底薪與今日之底薪相差固大，但其所以增加實有種種因素，如；（一）過去租界各廠工人工資多不合理，如紗廠工人每日祗二角，其生活水準之低，實無以復加，如有勞資糾紛，則巡捕房出動警備車即可解決，故當時係受單方面之壓迫出此，不能認爲合理。</p>
<p>戰前勞資雙方簽訂年終加薪協定者，市府至今仍認爲有效。但自民國二十五至三十五之十年抗戰期，在日人槍刺咸脅下工人不敢提出一要求，直至勝利後工人乃於去年經協議後一次加上。今工商界定欲恢復至二十五年底薪，無形中欲一筆勾銷年終加薪之協定，不可能實行。又如紗廠工人恢復至戰前每日二角底薪，依五月份生活指數計算月入祇十餘萬，即吃豆渣亦吃不飽。中國資方之窮，固係事實，但不能一味在工人頭上找出路，亦應從銷路，原料等方面着想。今外界多指余偏護勞方，如言對工人較多同情心則爲事實，言偏護則不能承認。</p>
<p>又中國勞動協會書記長沈鼎徵談，指數解凍，若干工廠如確因營業關係，不勝負荷，自可邀集勞方代表，公布經濟狀况，開誠協商個別解決，工人自亦願體諒廠方情形商決合理數字，共維工業危機。今工業界一味於各種辦法中尋求於已有利之規定，而忽略福利工人之章則，誠非我人硏究解決事理應有之態度。</p>

<p>司法判決迅速進行。（三）在上項問題未解決前，要請招商局最低限度須比照海軍總司令部四月二十日臨時救濟辦法（官兵家屬一百萬元，士兵家屬六十萬元）按照目前物價指數發給臨時救濟金。（四）自九日起至今日止，各家屬在滬之食宿費用，均由招商局負担。（五）以後家屬訪晤招商局負責人，不得拒見。葛氏與沈副總經理允與徐總經理會商後，定今日中午答復。至昨晚九時，招商局並招待全體請願家屬晚餐後散去。（附圖爲坐待招商局外之家屬，本報攝）</p>
<h3>參觀戚墅堰機廠　自造流綫型列車　四輛正在裝配年內可望應用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕盛行美國之流綫型火車，行將於年內騁馳於京滬綫上，其式樣一如吾人習見西文雜誌上所刋載之廣吿然。　此項車輛現正由戚墅堰機廠自行製造中，計劃中之列車，共有九節，其特點除車身外表作橢圓形外，內部裝置頗多革新之處，如門窗均爲絕綠體，利用空氣調節器，調節車內之空氣及溫度，同時並有冷氣及暖氣之裝置，屆時將無分冬夏，經常保持「滿室如春」。</p>
<p>座位部份亦將採取活動方式，即可任人之意，自由改爲正坐式或半臥式。又車廂與車廂間其構造將緊相銜接，不若現時列車間之有相當距離，故有「渾然一體」之感。</p>
<p>至車廂四角出入口之脚踏板，於列車開行後，即可藏人車內，外表不露一絲痕跡。</p>
<p>當記者昨日前往戚墅堰機廠參觀時，目睹技工數十人，正在埋頭工作，其中四輛已在裝配中。至此次值得吾人一提者，即比項車輛之底架及車身等，均爲該廠听自製。</p>
<p>據該廠廠長郎鍾騋及工程師劉近義。劉昌夏語記者稱：該項流綫型列車，原定計劃今夏即可實現，嗣以內部冷氣設備，因訂貨遲延，致吿擱淺。現時除向美國繼續訂購外，同時正計劃自行製造。</p>
<p>又該廠工作範圍，除主要修造機客貨車外，並兼營副產物，如煉製焦炭，電石，提製氧氣等，供給廠路之需。關於修理機車部份，敵僞時期工作效率甚低，平均每月僅能大修機車三輛，目前則已逐步增至每月大修機車九輛。美軍顧問團前曾往該廠參觀，對於修理部份，頗有佳評。</p>

<h3>證金改繳美金債券問題　暫時准許變通辦是　在財經兩部未正式令遵以前　仍可以現金或美金債券抵充</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於證劵交易所遞延交易證據金代用品部份，改納美金債劵一事，財經兩部駐證交監理官王鱉堂及吳公魯，昨已接到兩部臨時通知，當即備文轉送證交，着令在未奉正式部示前，關於遞交證據金代用品部份，暫時仍准以現金或美金債劵抵充。</p>
<p>按兩部對繳納債劵之第二次批示，本限於本月十六日前，對遞交證據金代用品部份，槪須繳納美金債劵。茲經紀人方面，以期限迫促，而現實困難，迄未解除，常由公會推派理事長陳靜民，常務理事兪明時，林宗靖等三人，於十一日晋京，向財經兩部面陳困難，並望兩部對（一）證據金繳納債劵，（二）遞交再度延期兩事，於本月十六日前，先有明確表示。茲兩部臨時通知駐證交監理員暫時變通辦法，則現行繳納遞交證據金辦法，無形中已予延期云。</p>
<h3>公會代表晉京　面陳處境困難</h3>
<p>證劵交易所經紀人公會理事長陳靜民，常務理事兪明時，林宗靖等三人，於十一日晋京後，業於昨日返滬。據陳氏語記者：此次代表經紀人公會向財經兩部當局面陳經紀人處境之困難，旣無要求，亦非請求。且於行前徵得證交當局同意，由證交出具介紹函件。晋京後曾晤財部戴司長，經部鄧司長，及兩部主管科長，面陳意見：（一）遞交證據金代用品，改納美金債券，經紀人不過爲居間人性質，理應由客戶繳納。現因債劵尙在推行期間，故客戶多未購備。致第一次部令到時，經紀人及客戶方面，均不及準備，致是日行市暫缺，並非經紀人故意罷市。且自遞交證據金全部暫改繳納現金後，經紀人方面遞交交易，已减少四分之三。故仍望當局爲維持股票之流通及信用計，准股票與債劵並用，並希於十六日前有確切表示。（二）遞交交易期限，即將於六月卅日屆滿，是否能再展期，亦望當局於十六日前有所表示，以資遵循。然遞交交易現不啻已爲經紀人交易之生命綫。深望政府應予儘量培植。果政府對遞交行市不滿，儘可在證交營業細則中嚴加規限，勿另作硬性規定。兩部對經紀人所陳各點，表示深切瞭解。陳氏等返滬後，當於昨日與證交王總經理洽談一過，洽定十六日部令萬一不能到達時之補救辦法，並於昨日下午三時，召開經紀人理監事聯席會臧，報吿此行經過云。</p>
<h3>統債盤好　外股微升</h3>
<p>公債昨繼續盤好，僅統戊略見不振。統丙晨開七四〇〇元，低價七〇〇〇元，高價八〇〇〇元，最後在七五〇〇元左右盤旋。五五二室五五五室賣出，五三三室五〇三室則進，成交約五六百萬。結果較前收計甲乙升三百元，丙升一百元，丁種好起二百元，統戊尙低三百元。</p>
<p>外股昨賡續生色，怡紗晨開五八〇〇〇元，廣帮及洋商買胃較殷，金業有供，證劵帮進後有出，良以華股堅後亦回也。高價達六二〇〇〇元，而後退至六〇〇〇〇元關邊掙扎。港申電報十五元二，刺激甚微，結果較前收計怡啤業廣紙業航業各漲一成，怡紗鋼業會德豐各升半成强，英聯雖升而不多。</p>
<h3>人絲買氣濃厚</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲又吿堅挺。一二〇號旭字有光各方進意頗濃，呈直綫上升之勢，迄午收盤喊一千八百八十萬元。東洋牌子最大到九百十五萬元。下午因有乘高價拋售，於是稍見回落。最後價爲八百五十萬元賣出。比上日漲起八十萬元。廠經依然疲軟，高勻度五担頭仍無交易做開。綢廠帮進胃甚淡。綢貨大誠被面喊九百萬元，華强被面八百八十萬元有成交，比上日小十萬元。大　格子豐鄉因賣多於買，故市勢不振，中間三千五百元有做開。最後回做三千三百元收市，比上日軋小三百元。</p>
<h3>食米市况轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米六千四百餘石，近郊鄉莊動辦較殷，而以秈米最爲俏利，市况轉挺，猛升二三萬元。粳米亦隨之上漲一二萬元。麵粉去化仍淡，市勢轉懈。豆餅交易不濃，廠餅挺昂一二千元。黃豆汕頭納取，回漲五六千至萬元。紅糧北方問津，酒坊納取，飛升萬餘元。苞米北洋採納，回漲七八千元。芝蔴洋莊活躍飛騰萬元。新元麥猛跌萬元。油市以東北　海靑島來貨　換‘略見挺秀。</p>
<h3>小麥貸欵　原則已核准　下週內可望貸放</h3>
<p>麵粉廠業所申請之小麥貸放，政府在原則上業已核准，詳細辦法，現尙在計議中。預計下月內四聯總處即可批准通過，實施貸放，屆時大小各廠均可承貸，各粉廠現已在着手籌備赴產麥區大量收購，以便恢復生產云。</p>
<p>又據第四區麵粉工業同業公會來函，聲稱該會理監事，近日並無謁見汪司長之事實，昨報所載談話內容與該業甚有影響，未便默承云。</p>
<h3>食糖續跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續疲，進出亦稀，公會對盤秘魯砂初市尙堅爲五十七萬五千元，後爲五十六萬八千元，小六七千元。二〇台中砂白四十七萬元，台赤三十七萬元，各小五千元。三半車白五十一萬元，小萬元。號貨汕　靑開三十二萬元至三十一萬六千元，小四千元。興化白四十五萬元至四十三四萬元，小萬餘元。興赤三十三四萬元，刁靑二十九萬元，統共成交不及三百件。</p>
<h3>白煤疲軟</h3>
<p>白煤到貨充斥，走銷一時難能暢達，趨勢依然疲軟。烟煤上檔貨開平屑阜新層等，市上綾有供貨，行市步見回軟。</p>
<p>華股昨見起色，惟漲勢仍限於永紗，餘股不過追隨而已。三成現金保證，暫可維持原狀，其他提案一時尙難解決。永紗曾數度迫近漲限，但臨收前復受蘇大使撤退之流言，而起回風。良以散戶仍扼於三成證金，不能暢所欲爲也。永紗套利塲內仍祇一二〇左右，合息價不過一角，由一七八號中國通商貼進成交極少。代收代解號家，息價仍開一角六分半及二角一，相去甚多，整個股市尙待澄淸。晨開稍高，遞永紗開後由五八七〇元，升至六〇一〇元。二二六號一〇〇號一七三號八三號賣到五九二〇元，一六三號一九〇號一五五號一五三號八五號七六號趁勢進至六〇六〇元。一五七號一八〇號一〇六號八三號六五號賣出，二三一號更來套賣，復退至五九五〇元。一〇二號九七號八號二一八號七六號二三四號八九號六五號三二號二一八號一四號均納，遞永紗盤高至六一六〇元。此時散多一度獲利了結，一〇四號九一號三六號有售，退至六〇五〇元左右。一〇二號一五七號六五號三二號二三四號二三二號二二三號一五三號一二九號一三〇號九九號連袂購買，商務由一五七號等首先掛高至漲停，現遞美亞亦迫漲限，遞永紗升至六三〇〇元，即交達六一五〇元。三二號七六號二二四號脫手，降爲六二〇〇元。一五七號三二號二一三號一五二號尙來買進，二一三號一五二號更進現永紗，遞交升至六三二〇元。現永紗升爲六一七〇元。一八六號一五號三一號賣出，降至六一七〇元。此時二二四號補進較多，新亞亦達漲限，再升爲六三〇〇元。傳蘇大使返國，敏感者咸加了結，一時賣氣漸濃，一五四號七六號一五七號一六三號八五號一八三號俱賣，臨收前降爲六〇〇〇元。一八六號一一七號補進，而以六一〇〇元結束。收後二二三號賣出，降低至六〇五〇元以下。結果較前收計新華平平，永公漲一成，永紗新光中法各升半成左右，信和美亞景福華豐勤興微升，商務漲停，水泥五和微升，景綸漲起一成，大通中紡榮豐麗安各漲半成强，火柴新亞漲停後有回，前者軋升半成，後者不過平平而已。遞交股計新光永公景藕微升，華豐亦然，美亞漲停後有回，與永紗同升半成。動興獨好一成。塲外各老股喊價見升，但仍屬供過於朮。</p>
<h3>聯華定期上市</h3>
<p>聯華地產業已批准，試行上市，定十六日起登塲，定一萬股爲單位。</p>
<h3>茶市未見起色</h3>
<p>昨洋莊茶市，交易未見生色，惟市勢因賣氣尙屬平席，缺乏變化。他若津地殷需之綠茶芯，以吐納喊價不一，殊鮮成交。其他花色因本街及客帮去化絡繹，人心不餒，過程咸釋穩定。</p>
<h3>到期折金存款　仍應付給黃金　財部電四聯轉知</h3>
<p>關於折金存單到期兌付一案，前經財政部規定應一律向原存行局兌付黃金，並可由上海各行局代兌。茲悉四聯總處准各行局先後函稱，略以黃金現由政府禁止買賣，並由中央銀行掛牌收購，與以往自由買賣情形不同。所有各行局折金存款未兌部份，應如何處理，未奉明令規定。又如折金存戶要求照代收方式，按中央銀行牌價兌付法幣，可否照辦，爲求各行局辦理一致起見，請統籌核議。茲經四聯總處轉准財政部復稱，折金存款之兌付，原與黃金買賣不同。所有各行局經辦之折金存款，到期仍應付給黃金，以符原約。至收兌黃金價格，旣經中央銀行核定，每兩四十八萬元，關於到期黃金存單兌付，其尾數應按上列價格計算，折付國幣云。</p>
<h3>紡建估價委會　通過廿六年單價　全部估價工作需時一月餘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司估似委員會，於昨日下午三時，在紡建公司召開第四次委員會議。到主委劉泗英，委員李馥蓀。劉攻芸。奚玉書。吳蘊初·楊于澊·秦潤鄉。歐陽崙等十餘人，討論至五時許散會。當通過單價小組會所審定之公司各項固定資產，民國廿六年時之單價。該項通過之單價，即將油印分發紡建所屬各廠分別塡報。至於單價應增加之指數問題，將再由估價小組會議定候核。全部估價工作，至少需時一月以上，方能完成。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：紡建公司主要固定資產民廿六年時之單價，以紗錠計，連附帶設備在內，每錠約估法幣七十至八十元。以織機計，普通織機每台約七百至八百元，自動織機每台約八百元至一千元云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕將任紡調會主委之鄒秉文，昨應第六區棉紡公會之請，於中午一時許，出席該公會之宴會。席間曾就整個棉紡事業，廣泛交換意見，迄三時許散席。據鄒氏於會後語記者，懇談經過，殊屬良好。</p>
<h3>劉泗英談　出售問題</h3>
<p>經濟部次長劉泗英氏，日前來滬主持紡建估價委會會議，公畢於昨晚返京。劉氏行前接見記者稱：紡建公司並非全部出售，百分之三十仍將保留爲國營，其餘百分之七十則分成最小單位，招標出售，或發行股票。每單位之股票發行至半數以上時，該事業單位之受理權，即轉移爲商股所有。至出售部份，僅以廠房機器土地爲限，原料成本不在其列。估價標準則已決定爲照廿六年物價指數計算，待全部估價工作完畢，即呈報政院核准。</p>
<p>劉氏繼闡釋出售國營事業之目的謂：此舉在提倡民營事業與平衡國家預算，渠稱：現已決定出售之國營事業可値十萬億元，劉氏對全經會硏擬中之經濟改革方案，認該方案係根據經濟緊急措施方案擬訂，惟將剔除其中不合事宜部份，故改革方案爲具有永久性者。</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售五一七件，全部　予廠商，申購共二八〇戶云。</p>
<h3>紡管會奉令撤銷　正準備接收中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉，紡管會曾於上週間，接奉經部批示，着令撤銷，準備接收。後該會業務處劉處長，曾晋京請示，當經認爲該會目前所辦各項業務，不能一日中輟，故決定業務照常，惟準備接收。至如何接受，刻仍靜候部令中。聞該會職員共五十八人，內業務處佔卅三人，且其中有廿人係向紡建公司借調而來，故辦理結東時，人事調遣，將不致遭遇困難。</p>
<p>又該會辦理紗布北運事宜，業已將各廠商個別之限額，分別通知在案。十六日起，可開始接受申請。南運紗布，自十一日開始申請以來，刻已發證，開始南運云。</p>
<h3>經濟常識講座</h3>

<h3>憶茫你先生</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>中午過福州路，在舊貨攤上，看見有個京銅墨盒，上面篆着茫父先生所作的梅花和詩，不禁想起二十年前胖胖茫父先生來；將這個墨盒買回來拭擦乾凈之後，那熟悉的字跡，頓然令我回憶起若干往事。</p>
<p>凡是愛玩玩京銅墨盒的人，大半對於姚茫父和陳師曾兩位先生沒有不熟悉的罷？他們在北京享盛名時候，齊白石，徐悲鴻一輩人，還是默默無聞呢！紈扇上，書齋間，可以說北平當年的士大夭階級，都充滿了茫父的字畫和銅刻；而西單牌樓轉角處的「黔陽春」，也是茫父先生手創的，春秋佳日，在座的名士雅安，可以稱爲集「京師」之大成了。</p>
<p>記得當年在張廉溪先生家裏看到茫父先生，他已經非常發福了，滿口黔音的官話，襯着他那副爽朗的性格，和揮灑成文的精神，在我幼小的心靈裏捺下很深的印象。</p>
<p>先父退隱之後，接近的人很少，而在他底書齋和花園裏，有時來了這位胖胖的「名士」，談論詩文，花前月下的風詠雖成陳跡，然而至今想起，仍油然有一種「朦隴的美感」。</p>
<p>爲着先父和茫父先生爲總角交的緣故，我因着年幼隨侍在側，也常常見到茫父，師曾幾位前輩。不幸在茫父先生辭世不久先父因爲投資失敗，欠了中孚銀行的債務，使得家中陷於破產的地步，因而使得先父隻身旅食四方；爲着家中已無長物可質，有一天，我被派持着茫父先生的一張條幅，一個雙面折扇，和一卷早年詩稿到琉璃廠去；最後，在市憎可憎的面容之下，那張條幅和扇面買了兩塊錢，我挾着那一卷被他們稱爲偽造的，茫父先生早年的詩卷，帶着無限悲凉的心情，回到家裏去。</p>
<p>十多年的歲月，在戰爭中忽忽地過去了。在桂林熊佛西先生的榴園裏，有一次談到了茫父先生，大家頗爲他興嘆不置。想起當年靠着出賣茫父舊藏書籍爲活的世兄XX先生，如今雖已貴顯，他底手裏所存先人的遺墨，想必也不太多了罷？</p>
<p>佛老猶爲我說了一個關於茫父先生的小掌故：</p>
<p>在黔陽春開張的那天，北京城裏眞可謂轟動一時，王夢白那些老畫家都各自帶着非常名貴的佳作做爲賀禮；，人差不多都到齊了，只差一位師曾先生，衆人都非常納悶。</p>
<p>按照茫父和師會先生的私交，他今天不應該不到，而且大家都猜得到，師曾一定會帶一幅名貴的禮物的，所以主人不知客人都非常的惦記。</p>
<p>後來，果然師曾先生來了，不出衆人所料的，他帶來一軸精心繪製的巨幅，大家挪簇着主人和師曾先生，拉開中堂一看，原來是一幅師曾的名作；，六尺的畫面上，畫着一個大酒變，上面斜垂着一枝丹桂，好像被酒氣薰醉了的桂花，都落入酒　一樣：</p>
<p>這樣一幅名畫，自然使得衆人心折；尤其高興的是主人茫父先生；他興冲冲地請當時在座的人在這張畫上題詠，並且懸掛在應堂正中。這種對於師曾的尊敬態度，想到文人相輕的文壇風習，不禁令人感慨系之了。</p>
<p>過了兩年黔陽春因爲不善於經營的綠故，經理就偸偷地跑掉了；而這位經理對於一切銀錢財物都沒有動，只偸走師曾先生的這幅中堂。那時師曾先生已經做了古人，在茫父先生心裏，自然覺得非常難過的。他就懸了四百塊錢的賞格，終於將這幅畫尋了回來。</p>
<p>看到這幅畫重歸物主，同時又增加了一種賭物思人的感情，茫父先生就在畫邊上，把這一段失而復得的經過，原原本本地寫在上面。這樣，黔陽春又再度復業，當然這張畫仍舊掛在原來的老地方。</p>
<p>眞是無巧不成書，黔陽春不幸二次淸理，奇怪的是經理先生仍然照例的把那幅畫偸了去，這可把茫父先生念壞了，我們想一想，在那種心情之下，對於他精神上的打擊，將百倍於黔陽春的關門呢！</p>
<p>後來，這幅畫到茫父先生物化之後，才露了面，可惜在這戰爭中，就再也沒有誰聽到關於它的下落的消息。</p>
<p>士大夫氣與名士風被揚棄的今日，不用說人琴俱亡的悲哀，就連較後於茫父的負盛名於當代的白石老人，十年塵夢之後在滬的一次畫展，也覺得有點近於粗製濫造，在這「舉世不復見漢官儀」的今天，我猶能以柴米之餘買到茫父先生繪裂的京銅墨盒，不禁想起如烟的往事來。</p>
<p>不知道這個墨盒是從那個衰落的門第裏流到市區中的，而我呢？在戰爭裏遺失得太多的書籍與原稿，也無法保證自己會永遠地保存着它。看着這個「烟霞滿面」的畟盒，和上面題着：「中有無際定花光，春氣烟蘊別有香；半臂黄衫何處客，一聲長笛滿樓霜。」的題旬，就逕帶的想起，這正是：「十二樓中吹玉笛，江城五月落梅花。」的時節，而在上海，就說騷人墨客罷？也多少帶着一些洋塲惡少的神氣了。</p>
<p>茫父的山水多作層樹壘翠之勢，氣魄雄渾，格調高古，不類今日的潑墨，了無書卷氣那樣一看便俗。他和袁寒雲　生的字很相彷彿，也都得力於鄭蘇戡；然而，舍間存着茫父先生早年的楷嘗，却是宗法於趙松雪，功力之深厚，也是不同凡響的。</p>
<h3>記陳望道</h3>
<p>— 姚天羽</p>
<p>一提起道位先生來，不由得使人想到他的綽號（那是別人給他取的）「歪嘴道人」。眞的，他的尊貌太差了。但我們假如要抱着「以貌取人」的態度來衡量他，那是要「失之子羽」的。因爲他貌雖不揚，但他的爲人和治學精神還是不容我們小覷的。</p>
<p>說他的爲人，實在是一位好好先生，他從不得罪任何人，而且還有着帮助人的熱忱，比如你有什麽要求，只要他能力許可，從不使你失望。這是只要和他有一面之緣的類皆知之。</p>
<p>就治學方面說，那更値得我們欽佩的了。他對於治理各種學問，素以謹嚴著稱。即以修辭學一門來說，這是他研究最精的學問，你假如曾翻過他所著「修辭學發凡」這部書的，你可以發現這裏面對於文章修辭的道理，闡述得異常週到詳明，絕對看不出一絲一毫苟且馬虎的毛病。其次，美學理論，他也有着精到的硏究。</p>
<p>他平時不輕易執筆寫文章，有時寫起一篇文蔁來，一字一句，都要經過他許多次仔細的推敲；而且每一篇文章，從頭至尾，都是要緊的句子，絕沒有穿插一句不必要的意思。而詞藻的美麗，那更不在話下。陳光生是精研修辭學和作文法的人，當然有這特點。</p>
<p>陳先生以前主編遇「太白半月刋」，裏面所發表的文字，都經過他親自用嚴格手段選取出來。所以每期都有精采，得到讀者的歡迎。尤其値得一提的，這裏面每期都有用美麗生動的文筆所寫的科學小品，這是別的判物所缺乏的。可惜這刋物出得不多久，就吿夭折了。我們希望陳先生能在最近重振旗鼓，恢復起來。</p>
<p>陳先生過去曾是于右任氏所創上海大學中國文學系的主任，在他主任之下，所有敎授，都是國內學術界文藝界知名之士，所以這一系的學生特別多。而且經他栽培出來的學生現在多半成了文壇上的著名作家。</p>
<p>他又是復且大學的敎授，他和復旦的關係也是一直沒有中斷。聽說目下他還是在復且執敎。在去年的暮秋，我曾在某種塲合遇見了他，覺得他如今已有些蒼老了的樣子。</p>
<h3>詩語</h3>
<p>— 沈先源</p>
<p>詩是淸新的語言，在人們意識領城裏時或一閃的光亮；這種光源眞實地存在於宇宙之中</p>
<p>所以不一定寫在紙上的才能算詩，那是宇宙的眞實，一種最易忽略或者不能捕捉到的完整而美麗的感情。—有生命和美麗的地方就是詩！</p>
<h3>記馬宗融</h3>
<p>— 李溶如</p>
<p>馬宗融，這文壇上的輝煌的名字，是一位遐邇皆知的老作家。</p>
<p>馬敎授早年留學法國，對法文有着深遂的造詣。在他底浩繁的著作中，泰半爲翻譯作品。例如他底譯自法文的小說「春潮」，行文細膩簡潔，而尤富有無限淸新雋永的意味，宛如一首美好的散文詩，直令讀之不忍釋手。他是復旦有名的老敎授，所開的課是小說史，法文，和大一國文。</p>
<p>他講課時，語多詼諧有趣。通常博引中外古今的例證，以深入淺出的手法，解釋深奧枯燥的理論，極受同學們的愛戴。</p>
<p>據說，自古到今的文人，大都不修邊幅；不是于思滿面，便就是頭髮蓬鬆，放浪形骸。有人說這是矯情，而又有人說，這是超塵絕俗，爲文人所應取的生活方式。但，我們這位老作家却不是如此的，他身着畢挺的西服，手提那光淸的手杖，神彩奕奕的往返於去校途中。那一幅嚴肅整潔的紳士派頭，不由得使人生一種欽敬的感覺。</p>
<p>他住在復旦的敎授宿舍，一幢日本式的小洋房，佈置得井井有條，前次作者拜訪他時，書桌上擺滿了字典和參考書，他正在孜孜的翻譯法文名著「左拉傳」呢！他談鋒甚健，可從人生宇宙一直扯到男女間的瑣碎小事，一談就是數小時。</p>
<p>他的脾氣很剛直，對於一些不順眼的事，他是毫不忌憚地加以批評的。雖然已是五十歲的人了，但他的心還是年靑的。</p>
<h3>關於洪爲法</h3>
<p>— 張嗚春</p>
<p>介紹「揚州續夢」作者</p>
<p>在申報春秋上，比較最受歡迎的作品，洪爲法先生的「揚州續夢」也是一種。借此地位談談他的爲人，諒爲讀者所樂聞的吧。</p>
<p>無須說，他是老揚州，道地的揚州通，凡與揚州有關的著作，不論古今，你可以在他的書架子上翻到的。他有個人口衆多的小家庭，本可够用的屋子，却被他的書架子佔去大半的空間，家裏人只有被迫轉進——牆角落了。</p>
<p>他在中學讀當時，數理成績很好，因爲買不起洋裝書，沒法，到大學只有讀「之乎者也」。</p>
<p>他做過不大不小幕僚一類的官，不是他不耐簽名辦公，却是中國的政風不對他的勁兒；他有良心，有正義，又有一頸腦子的主張，對某一樁事，有時似乎要參加一點「我以爲」。他深知「道不行」，所以只好自動的重度文敎生涯。</p>
<p>他是文人故事專家，出過專書「中國文人故事選」及「談文人」。眞的，不獨中國正史上，甚至野史，說部，詩話，詞話裏有片言隻句可傳的文人，爲他所不知道的，可算寥寥無幾。什麽張春水，鮑夕陽，崔黄葉，管杏花，說起來總像他的老朋友。假如你和他提到阮元，他接着就是「當阮元窮的時候——」，馬上吿訴你一大串人不易知的故事。一次，作者和他在鎭江南郊散步，道經米墓舊址，他一面走，一面吿訴我米瘋子的故事；一個接着一個，如鋸木層，霏霏不絕。他如果做一個名勝導遊者，不獨使人遊目騁懷，並且賞心悅耳哩。</p>
<p>他是個標準老師。抗戰期間，他一向在蘇北播遷執敎。他所在的學校——省一臨中——是蘇北名符其實的第一個好中學。因此之故，凡中央勢力所及的蘇北地區的知識份子，沒有一個不知道「洪老師」其人的。「洪老師」變成他的別號。每個學生都怕他，也都敬他。他的訓導方針是「做人第一」，決不含糊。他實在是一位「望之儼然，即之也溫」的正統老師。他因爲今日敎師的水準太「那個」學生太民主，不便共同負責，所以也就無意於道「人之患」了。</p>
<p>他塡得一手好詞。他的詞，淺人不易了解。他專在沈鬱頓挫四字上用功夫，這是我國詞評泰斗淸末丹徒陳亦烽先生在其鉅著白兩齋詞話裏所揭　的詞律。所以欣賞他的詞，是需要密咏恬吟的功夫的。</p>
<p>他的舊詩也做得不差，同時又是舊詩的理論家，他出過「絕句論」，「律詩論」，「古詩論」，三種著作。要看他的散文，揚州續夢可作爲抽樣。</p>
<p>他具備中國文人傳統的特性：好酒。和他提到酒，像和一位高中男孩子談他的女朋友，勢在必得，期在必醉。信不信由你，入席之前，他看到酒壺的影子，似已有三分　　的樣兒了。不飲而有酒意，吾於斯人見之也。家常吃飯，常川奉陪他的是一把精緻的祖傳小酒壺。他的娛樂，幻想，靈感，甚至他的天地，就在那小小酒壺中。酒醉之後，雲兒霧兒的出口成章。吿訴你個秘訣，這時你要和他商量什麼問題，包行：「好，好，好，」他眯着眼說：「天下沒有商量不了的問題呀。呵呵！」</p>
<p>他到朋友家裏，專喜無條件的稱贊人家的太太，（値得値不得稱贊另一回事）他的秘訣，不是稱贊那太太的各方面，因爲攏統的好好好，顯得敷衍；乃是贊賞她的某一方面，於是那太太便以爲有超人的特點而自得雖窮到截髮，也樂於歡迎這位嘉賓了。他用的贊語，例如：王太太自剪的旗袍樣子比成衣匠高明；李太太燒的鯽魚湯比館子裏的鮮；林太太自創的燙髮形式最合於藝術要求……之類。</p>
<p>不過他心目中的標準太太是什麽樣子呢？那是他積數十年之經騐，經過千錘百鍊所得的五字眞經：「少言多微笑。」</p>
<p>他也打小得可憐的馬將，却是爲打馬將而打馬將，絲毫不苟，照例擺出研究式的矜持態度，往往三思而後出銃。</p>
<p>筆者受過僞軍與漢奸的侮辱，常想報復、他不主張。他說：「當今之世，但求苟全；今天是你打不死的牛鬼蛇神，明天照常變成權威，中國的壞人最有辦法，嗨嗨！」</p>
<p>少年時代，他依照書本做人，得罪過不少人。「人家都說我圓通些了，」他說：「要知道我忍心害理，硬行降低道德水準，才換得這圍通二字」最後他嘆一聲：「唉！」這一聲「唉」，大約是許多中年人共同的嘆聲吧？</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Siping; National Army Calmly Launches Counterattack; Anshan-Shenyang and Jilin-Changchun Lines Also Heavily Attacked</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 13th] The moment for the great battle of Siping has arrived. Starting from the 11th, the Communist army launched successive fierce attacks, which intensified last night, using dense artillery fire to bombard the airfield.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Since the recovery of the Northeast, the postal remittance bureau has been seeking to restore postal remittances between post offices inside and outside the Customs, but this has not been realized due to the special circumstances and different currency systems outside the Customs. Now, with the approval of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters of the President, the post offices inside the Customs will first open a type of ordinary remittance to the outside of the Customs (various places in the Northeast), temporarily limited to remittances for family support, not exceeding 30,000 Northeast Circulation Notes per person per month.

<h3>China-Mongolia Border Issue; Sino-Soviet Treaty Stipulates That the Existing Border Shall Prevail; Mongolian Army's Invasion of Beitashan Is Indeed a Deep Incursion into Our Territory</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Since the Xinjiang incident occurred, all parties have attached great importance to the China-Mongolia border issue. This reporter visited Fu Jiaoling, Director of the Department of Territory of the Ministry of Interior, on the morning of the 13th to inquire about his views on the border issue. He said that, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the border between China and Mongolia "shall be the existing border." The border survey work has not yet begun because diplomatic relations have not been established between the two countries. However, the "existing border" referred to in the treaty should be the one shown in the "Map of the Administrative Regions of Mongolia" published by the Ministry of Interior in 1940, which is more detailed and reliable. The Mongolian army has now penetrated Beitashan, 600 li deep into the territory of Xinjiang Province, which is indeed an invasion of our territory and cannot be compared to a border dispute. Outer Mongolia is divided into fifteen aimags (equivalent to our provinces) and one special municipality, with an area of 1,553,500 square kilometers and a population of approximately 800,000.</p>
<h3>Many Sections of the Beining Railway Damaged; Trains Between Beijing and Tianjin Suspended; Communist Army Fiercely Attacks Cangxian on the Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The entire Beining Railway was blocked on the 13th. Several sections between Beijing and Tianjin were damaged at 3:00 AM on the 13th. Three steel bridges between Beicang and Yangcun were blown up. A coal car hit a mine and three cars overturned under the bridge. One section between Yangcun and Douzhangzhuang and one section between Wanzhuang and Langfang have been repaired, and the rest are being repaired. The National Army in Tianjin has also dispatched teams to suppress the rebels, and the fighting is taking place nearby. All trains between Beijing and Tianjin were suspended on the 13th. The railway bureau stated that traffic may be restored on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The 3 li section between Liushouying and Zhangjiazhuang on the Jinyu section that was previously demolished has been repaired by 8:30 AM on the 13th. Two sections of the railway between Jinxihe and Chadian were blown up on the morning of the 13th and were also repaired by 8:30 AM. Traffic on the Jinyu section has been restored.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Communist army, with two columns and five brigades, launched a full-scale offensive between Jinghai and Cangxian on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway yesterday. Fighting continued on the 13th. Over 30,000 Communist troops from the nine regiments of the Fourth Column under Nie Rongzhen, the three regiments under Qiu Hongyin, and the three regiments under Liu Bingyan began attacking Dahaozhuang, Zao Po, Xiaoyuan, Dazidian, and Fenghuadian east of Cangxian at 5:00 PM on the 12th. By 3:00 AM on the 13th, their main force had reached the outskirts of Cangxian City and launched a fierce attack on the city from the east, west, and south directions. The fighting was fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Yongqing County, south of the Beijing-Tianjin line, was besieged by eight regiments of the Communist army last night. Fighting continued on the 13th. Six regiments of the Communist army were discovered near the artillery range south of Tongxian, and over 2,000 troops were also discovered in Dongxi Lucun to the southeast, attempting to echo the offensive on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and contain the National Army's actions in Beijing and Tianjin.</p>
<h3>List of Members of the General Election Office Announced; Date of Establishment Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The list of all members of the General Election Office has been officially announced by the National Government. Hong Lanyou told reporters on the 13th that the date of establishment has not yet been determined, but the first step after establishment will be to establish branch offices in various provinces. The selection of members for each branch office will still be handled according to the personnel distribution of the General Election Office, with each party taking responsibility. Finally, Hong expressed his disapproval of the proportional representation system proposed by various parties, because there is no such provision in the election regulations, which is not in line with the spirit of democracy.</p>
<h3>Conflict in Sera Monastery in Tibet Has Ended</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The recent political change in Tibet, the killing of Reting, and the resulting disputes between border ethnic groups have subsided, and this chaotic situation has been resolved. However, according to people from the Panchen Lama's office in Beijing, although this kind of incident has become a thing of the past, it may still occur repeatedly, which is very worrying. This reporter then visited the person in charge of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to inquire about the course of events, and he said that the Tibetan government arrested the Regent Reting Hutuktu and imprisoned him in mid-April, and also sent troops to besiege Sera Monastery. After hearing the news, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission telegraphed the Tibetan authorities, saying that Sera Monastery is a sacred place of Buddhism and should not be destroyed, and should be resolved peacefully, and that details should be reported. The Tibetan government replied on April 29, saying that the former Regent Reting attempted to harm the current Regent Taktra Hutuktu, so Reting and the related Che Da Huan people were arrested and detained. The ignorant monks of Sera Monastery echoed Reting and resisted the government, and the Tibetan monks, laypeople, and people's congress unanimously agreed to punish them. There was no destruction of temples, and all students and Han merchants in Tibet were properly protected. Recently, it was heard that Reting has died of illness in prison, and the military conflict in Sera Monastery has ended, and local order has been restored.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the Tibetan incident, this reporter visited relevant people, and they said that the government is urgently taking the following measures to deal with it: (1) Quickly send high-ranking officials to Tibet to comfort the people, (2) Develop work in the Tibetan areas near the border, (3) Promote various constructions in Tibet, (4) Strengthen the construction of Qinghai and Kang provinces. They believe that if the above points are ignored, the Tibetan affairs will still be precarious, and the relationship between the pro-British faction and the pro-Chinese faction will continue to evolve.</p>
<h3>Stalemate at Beitashan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 13th] The battle at Beitashan is currently in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Returns to Country to Report</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov's return to his country to report has been scheduled for the latter half of this month. Before leaving Beijing, he is scheduled to hold a reception at the embassy from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 17th to entertain envoys from various countries, our leaders, and people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>United Nations Agency Personnel Pay Attention to the Xinjiang Incident; Concerned About Whether China Will File a Complaint</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 12th] United Nations personnel are paying close attention to the report from the international press in Nanjing that China may file a complaint with the United Nations regarding the invasion of Xinjiang by Mongolian troops, but there has been no official comment. Unofficial personnel immediately speculated that if China does take this action, will it veto Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations in its capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, as the Security Council is about to review Outer Mongolia's application, and the joint committee of the Security Council and the General Assembly is currently discussing the procedures for United Nations membership. The Security Council Affairs Department of the United Nations Secretariat refused to comment on the report, but the international press report has made people here more concerned about the situation in Xinjiang, especially given another report stating that uranium mines were discovered in Qihe, northern Xinjiang, several months ago. If this news is true, it will directly involve the International Atomic Energy Commission, which is larger than the international control of atomic energy plans.</p>
<h3>Launching the Xinjiang Incident Aims to Probe the United States, the World Telegram Comments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Scripps-Howard World Telegram recently published a comment on the Xinjiang incident, claiming that the invasion of Xinjiang is to test the reaction of other major powers (including the United States) to this kind of situation. The newspaper stated that today's world must make a "choice of doctrine," one is the Truman Doctrine, and the other is the Hitler and Mussolini Doctrine, the latter of which "only leads to world chaos and disaster." The newspaper commented that large-scale wars do not come like a bolt from the blue, but their causes gradually brew.</p>
<h3>Northern Travelogue, Part Two - The Sofa That Lost Its Elasticity</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>Beijing is a sofa, a sofa that has lost its elasticity. It still gives people a feeling of comfort, but lying on it for a long time always feels a bit off, its internal springs have loosened. After twelve years of absence, this time I deeply felt this taste from it.</p>
<p>Why is it a sofa?</p>
<p>If you don't have the opportunity to overlook Beijing from a low-altitude plane, you can climb Jingshan and look around, and you will know that this city is not only the most beautiful city in China. Mayor He Siyuan said: Four words—"righteous and bright"—can describe Beijing, the front gate facing the back gate, the east gate facing the west gate, straight, the entire city square and upright, the houses and streets wide, each family has a courtyard—a courtyard house, full of sunshine. Mr. Li Songshen, a technician from the Municipal Works Bureau, also praised Beijing as the most excellent grid-shaped city in the world, which meets the requirements of the latest urban planning, namely (1) urbanization of urban gardens, (2) creative architecture, (3) residences near shops. This is a good place to live and rest!</p>
<p>Drink tea at Beihai Yilantang, Laijinyuxuan or Shanglinchun in Zhongshan Park; stroll along Chang'an Street and Wangfujing Street; browse the old book stalls and antique shops in Dong'an Market and Liulichang; Taiping flowers, peony flowers, peony flowers, lotus flowers, and chrysanthemums, each season has its own flowers to enjoy; casserole stewed pork at Shaguo Ju, hot pot at Xilaishun, Peking roast duck at Quanjude, there is no end to eating. And the people are so sincere and simple, and the air is so quiet and refreshing.</p>
<p>Why has it lost its elasticity?</p>
<p>In a word, the scenery remains the same, but everything else is different. Poverty has made this city lose its vitality, become depressed and paralyzed. Beijing has a population of more than 1.6 million, and 80 percent of them are unemployed or unproductive. In that 20 percent, three-quarters are salaried employees. Under the economic situation where prices are soaring today, we can easily imagine the living conditions of the citizens of this city. There is a saying in Beijing, "Three hangings," meaning that there is no house to live in, nothing to do, and rice is too expensive, each of which can drive people to hang themselves. In the few days that I stayed in Beijing, there were suicide news in the newspapers almost every day. The northern people are honest and simple, and they commit suicide when they can't live on. Although this docile way is pitiful and sad, can we ignore the serious impact presented by this silent accusation?</p>
<p>The tram company is suffering heavy losses, with a revenue shortfall of more than 300 million yuan last month. The company authorities plan to raise prices, but in view of the sharp decline in passengers after the last price increase, they are afraid to think about raising prices again. Because of the sharp decline in passengers, the result is a decrease in income. The same is true for rickshaws and pedicabs. From the east city to the west city, the highest fee does not exceed 3,000 yuan. The drivers have to grit their teeth and let the car price and commodity prices be as unrelated as a horse and an ox. They know that pulling a few less coins is better than no one caring. All these phenomena illustrate the poverty of the general public, and they are trying to reduce their living standards to the lowest possible level. One day, if they can't even eat corn cakes and cornmeal, accidents will be inevitable. A friend said, "Anti-hunger" slogans should be raised by the drivers in Beijing.</p>
<p>Originally, Beijing has no industry, or it can be said that it has no commerce. It is entirely a city of consumption.</p>
<p>If we were to force it, from 1926 to 1937, handicrafts had a glorious history and occupied a considerable number in foreign trade. It includes eight kinds of handicrafts such as carpets, lace, embroidery, and copper and tinware. But now, there are fewer people who have this kind of leisure and energy, and transportation has suffocated its vitality. The stalls at Dongdan Archway and the antique market at Tianqiao have many things that are so cheap that they are out of proportion to general prices. Even so, there are still few visitors in front of the door. After all, buying these leisurely and elegant things is not as necessary as buying a few bags of flour.</p>
<p>Without industry, commerce becomes one-sided and only supplies consumption, and because of geographical relations, it is not a transfer port. A person in charge of a financial institution told me that his business income is not enough to maintain the monthly recurring expenses of this unit. He also said that Beijing merchants are very trustworthy and very stable. They never take risks, and bankruptcies are rare. For example, doing a mortgage, in Shanghai, a merchant with 50 million goods can adopt the method of serial mortgage to make a market of hoarding 150 million US dollars of goods, Beijing merchants clearly know this method, but they will never do so.</p>
<p>Poverty has eroded purchasing power, reduced living standards, and forced everyone to struggle on the hunger line. Women wearing colorful veils are still speeding through Dongdan and Xidan in groups, the sound of camel bells outside Xizhimen is still so leisurely, and the red walls, yellow tiles, and green trees are still shining with color in the sun; ... The content of people's lives has changed significantly.</p>
<p>The sofa is still a sofa, but it lacks elasticity, and that comfort is very limited.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Postpones Flight to Xinjiang; Executive Yuan Review Meeting Listens to Report on Xinjiang Incident; Soviet Mongolia Has Not Yet Replied to Our Protest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The date of Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi's trip to Xinjiang. As of the 13th, it has not yet been decided, and it is expected to take place on the 14th or later. It is reported that Bai Chongxi was originally scheduled to fly to Xinjiang on the 12th, but later received a telegram from Zhang Zhizhong saying that the matter could be resolved locally, so he postponed the trip. He has now telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong again to discuss it, so the departure date should be after receiving Zhang's reply. Due to Bai Chongxi's postponement, there was talk in the capital on the 13th of reassigning Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei, which is difficult to believe, as the central government attaches great importance to this matter and does not change its view because it is a border incident. People here generally believe that the government is determined to ensure the border. When the Executive Yuan held a review meeting on the morning of the 13th, Bai Chongxi and Wang Shijie both gave reports. The political committee members exchanged views on the new situation, but made no decisions. According to relevant sources, the truth about the Beitashan incident is gradually becoming clear. Ethnic issues seem to be the crux of the matter, and loopholes in the part of the Sino-Soviet Treaty related to the Outer Mongolian border are the main cause of the outbreak. Xinjiang people in Beijing will express their opinions on this matter, possibly in the form of a letter to the people of Xinjiang, stating two points: one is the attitude towards the Outer Mongolian army's invasion of Xinjiang, and the other is to support the central government's endorsement of Mesut as the head of Xinjiang, and to call for new unity to consolidate our border territories.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] After the Xinjiang incident occurred, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously protested to both the Soviet and Mongolian sides, but as of the 13th, no reply had been received. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to announce anything about sending personnel to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] This reporter recently interviewed Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Participation Council, regarding the Xinjiang incident and asked him to express his thoughts. Shao said that this was a border conflict incident and would not escalate as seriously as rumored. Zhang Zhizhong has handled the situation in Xinjiang very well, and will continue to maintain a moderate attitude, so there should be no problems. Shao believes that this incident is expected to be resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Tianshan Society telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the 13th regarding the Outer Mongolian army's invasion of Xinjiang, and also sent a telegram to the whole country, requesting the government to take reasonable measures. The telegram was passed by the society's temporary board of directors meeting on the 13th. Xinjiang legislators Hua Shengmu·Maolu and others are all directors of the society, and most of the members are Xinjiang natives. The telegram proposed four measures for the government to adopt: (1) Strengthen the armed forces to defend the territory; (2) Adopt strong diplomacy to stop the aggression; (3) Based on the Ili Peace Treaty, declare the troops in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay areas and dispatch national troops to take over the border defenses of these three regions; (4) If necessary, file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. Furthermore, the National Women's Organizations Friendship Association held a meeting on the morning of the 13th to discuss the Xinjiang issue and decided to (1) mobilize women across the country to unanimously oppose the invasion; (2) contact all sectors of society to support the government; (3) launch an anti-aggression movement in the capital, hold another meeting on the morning of the 14th, and issue a declaration.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] An important member of the Democratic League said: Someone who served as an administrative official in Xinjiang for ten years said after returning that Xinjiang will become Outer Mongolia's second, which is deeply worrying. The current Xinjiang incident is not expected to escalate, and the government should resolve the problem through diplomacy and improve the internal situation in the province.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the 49th issue of the Tongji University Express yesterday: "The spokesperson of the Shanghai Student Federation is quite concerned about the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang and will issue opinions on the current situation on the following points today: (1) Request the government to promptly announce the actual situation of the Outer Mongolian invasion; (2) Publicly disclose the situation of negotiations with Outer Mongolia at any time; (3) Lodge a serious protest with Outer Mongolia."</p>

<h3>The Lüda Inspection Team Returns to Shenyang; Inspection Results to Be Reported to the Central Government Immediately; Soviet Union Still Refuses National Army Entry into Lüda</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th] The Lüda Inspection Team, led by Dong Yanping, took a special train from Huludao northward on the morning of the 12th, passed through Jinzhou at noon, and returned to Shenyang at 6:00 p.m. The team arrived in Lüda on the 3rd and left on the 12th, staying in the Soviet military guesthouse for ten days. Except for the 7th and 10th, when two groups went to Dalian for inspection and returned on the same day, the rest of the time was spent in Lushun. The inspection was divided into three groups: social, port, and China Changchun Railway. The Soviet army was responsible for reception and protection. There was little actual inspection, and most of the reports were made orally by Chi Zixiang in his capacity as the local person in charge (Chi is the Chairman of the Kwantung Administrative Office). There was only one instance where the people surrounded them in the market for a brief chat, so the team regretted not being able to have close contact with the people. According to a team member, the market in Lüda is orderly, and the food shortage has improved. The Soviet military commander in the area is General Beloborodov.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results of the inspection of Lüda will be reported to the central government in the coming days by Dong Yanping, who will fly to Beijing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet government has refused to allow government troops to enter Dalian and Lushun, and the Soviet government is deliberately delaying China's takeover of Lüda.</p>
<p>It is claimed that in October 1945, two months after Japan's surrender, the Chinese government notified the Soviet Union that Chinese officials would travel by sea to Lüda with troops. Given the circumstances at the time, the only way to travel was by sea, but the Soviet Union refused to allow travel by sea without giving any reason, and suggested that they travel by land. The Soviet Union was also well aware at the time that a land route was impossible. Subsequently, the Chinese government received reliable intelligence that there were anti-government armed forces in the vicinity of Lüda.</p>
<p>On March 7 of this year, the Soviet Union notified China that it was ready to transfer the administration of Lüda, and the Chinese government replied on March 31, detailing the reasons for China's postponement of the takeover and clarifying the Chinese government's new plan, which of course included the issue of sending troops. The dispatch of troops was necessary to protect the safety of administrative personnel, as it was known that Lüda was surrounded by the Communist army, and the Chinese government did not want to see a repeat of the Harbin incident. After several back-and-forths, the Soviet Union has so far resolutely opposed the entry of national troops into Lüda, making it impossible for China to restore its administrative power over the area.</p>
<h3>Accelerating the Strengthening of National Defense Is Our Urgent Task; Wei Lihuang's Remarks Upon Arriving in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Berlin Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing, 13th Special Dispatch] General Wei Lihuang, after visiting various countries in Europe, including England, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, arrived here this morning by train from The Hague with his wife, daughter, and accompanying secretaries. He first made a statement saying, "To strengthen national defense by accelerating scientific development is the urgent concern of China today." During his week-long stay in Germany, Wei plans to hold talks with the Allied occupation commanders, offer sacrifices at the Soviet war memorial, and pay tribute to the German battlefield. Wei will return to China via the United States after finishing his business and said that the lengthy and important report he will present to Chairman Chiang is nearing completion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th] General Wei Lihuang, in a private interview with a Central News Agency reporter, said: If China wants to keep pace with the countries he has visited, there are still many things that need to be completed in strengthening and modernizing China's national defense. He cited France as an example, saying: France needs to start from scratch, but France's performance in equipping and training armed forces is excellent. England and the United States are also implementing universal military training, and even Belgium is strengthening its military training and national defense work. He also told reporters: After returning to China, he will report to the government in detail on what he has learned from this trip and will make some suggestions on strengthening and modernizing national defense. Wei also said: It seems that none of the countries he visited intended to hide any secrets. He believes that the reason why these countries allowed him to see everything was perhaps because they knew that even if they gave us the blueprints and samples, we would still be unable to manufacture such secret designs of weapons. Wei's party originally planned to visit countries in the Middle East, but has now decided to return home via the United States after visiting Germany.</p>
<h3>Report by the American Tea Association: Tea Prices Will Rise, but Chinese Exports Will Hardly Return to Their Former Glory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] According to a report by the American Tea Association: Retail tea prices may rise due to costs and global shortages, but tea is still the most economical beverage. The report reviewed the global post-war situation and the domestic tea market in the United States, stating: There is currently no possibility of increasing global tea production, so prices will also rise to reflect increased costs. Unless Ceylon, India, the Dutch East Indies, China, and Japan restore pre-war production levels, there is no possibility of tea prices falling. Retail tea prices in the United States will also rise in the future. Although tea is not subject to international control, in a few years, global tea production will fall short of demand, as the tea gardens in all major tea-producing countries have suffered significant damage during the war. Although the prospects for Indian, Ceylonese, and Japanese tea are good, Chinese tea has declined by 70% since the War of Resistance against Japan due to political instability and economic chaos. In addition, Chinese tea growers use outdated methods in cultivation, processing, and marketing, and the tea estates in Taiwan's main "Oolong tea" production area have prices that are even higher than those on the international market. Therefore, the prospects for Chinese tea to restore its pre-war export volumes are even more bleak.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Lifting Foreign Exchange Controls and Rescuing the Current Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Since this spring, the fluctuations in commodity prices have intensified, and the intervals between these fluctuations have shortened. This phenomenon precisely illustrates that the economic crisis has become increasingly profound, almost on the verge of collapse. The situation is so urgent that we cannot afford to deliberate leisurely or go in the wrong direction and then try to remedy the situation. We should immediately come up with concrete measures and put them into action immediately. Therefore, regarding the current economic crisis, we advocate a quick rescue. Recalling the initial implementation of the import licensing system last winter, the original intention was to regulate foreign exchange and eliminate the threat of dumping. The main purpose of the emergency economic measures this spring, which prohibited the buying and selling of gold and banknotes and their circulation, was also to eradicate or at least reduce the disruptive factors of economic turmoil. However, the results of implementation were contrary to expectations. Economic turmoil continued as before and even intensified. Import restrictions slightly curbed dumping, but smuggling flourished instead, and the import of raw materials was genuinely restricted. The impact was that industrial production not only did not improve but also stagnated due to a lack of raw materials. Post-war materials were originally scarce. Without imports to regulate supply and demand, the scarcity would naturally increase, further fueling rising commodity prices. Foreign exchange allocation was nominally tightened, but the black market for foreign exchange never disappeared. Adjusting surpluses and deficits to meet supply and demand is a very natural economic phenomenon. Now, instead of guiding or supporting it, we rely solely on administrative pressure. How can this be effective? Remittances from overseas Chinese have fled, exports have been hindered, and there is no source of foreign exchange. How can the government supply it? The economic stalemate has created political distress. As a result, there is much debate, and remedies are applied haphazardly, further increasing the turmoil.</p>
<p>Some say that the current economic crisis is caused by the civil war, and unless the civil war stops, there is no way to resolve the economic crisis. We cannot completely deny this view. However, to mix economics and politics together and attribute all of today's economic stalemate to politics is also open to discussion. From our economic perspective, if appropriate policies are implemented thoroughly, there is still a way to deal with China's current economy. Once the economic stalemate is broken, political distress can at least be partially alleviated. Of course, we are not saying that once the economic problem is solved, all problems will be easily resolved. However, we believe that even before all problems are solved, addressing the economy in terms of the economy is not entirely without solutions.</p>
<p>The severity of the current economic crisis is generally considered to stem from fiscal imbalances. We also relatively agree with this view. However, fiscal policy and the economy are closely linked, and the economy is the source of fiscal policy. If we focus solely on fiscal policy and ignore the economy, it is like abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. Fiscal revenue and expenditure should be balanced, which is a matter of course. However, to focus solely on balance without regard to the economy is like draining the pond to catch all the fish! In this regard, we can say that unless there is a solution for the economy, there is no way out for fiscal policy. We can also say that the priority today is the economy, followed by politics.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the current economic crisis in China lies in the general lack of materials, stagnant production, and halted imports. Our misguided fiscal and economic policies have further exacerbated the situation. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. We do not want to dwell on theories. Here, we simply write out a few suggestions. We believe that the current economic crisis has reached a point where it must be rescued, and we hope that our suggestions can attract attention.</p>
<p>(1) Foreign exchange transactions should restore freedom. The current method of settling foreign exchange from exports should be abolished immediately. This would free exports from the constraints of foreign exchange settlement regulations, allowing exporters to freely sell their foreign exchange earnings in the market. This would break the stagnation of exports, and the strange phenomenon of smuggling would no longer be seen. However, to prevent capital flight through exports, exports should not require foreign exchange settlement but should still be subject to registration procedures. This would prove that all foreign exchange earned from exports is used to import materials or sold to importers. The central bank should also no longer force importers to provide the required foreign exchange. Importers should be allowed to purchase it from the market. This would eliminate the current cumbersome foreign exchange application procedures and the losses due to time delays. With free transactions, both importers and exporters would feel convenient. With export foreign exchange to supply imports, the import of essential goods can be restarted.</p>
<p>(2) Trade still needs appropriate controls. After the opening of foreign exchange, trade still needs appropriate controls. Otherwise, the abuses of last year's laissez-faire approach will be repeated. Imported goods should be strictly classified, and licensing measures should continue to be adopted before import. The import of luxury goods and non-essential goods should still be restricted or prohibited, while the import of essential goods should be relaxed as much as possible. In this way, all foreign exchange earned from exports can be concentrated on the import of essential goods. This would not only increase the supply of raw materials for domestic industries, alleviate the general panic over the lack of materials, and avoid the re-dumping of foreign goods, affecting domestic national industries. With this natural trend in foreign exchange, the international balance of payments will naturally become closer to equilibrium, which will help stabilize the exchange rate.</p>
<p>(3) The exchange rate should no longer be rigidly pegged. The natural level of the current legal tender's external value is still difficult to accurately determine, and it is not advisable to suddenly make a rigid peg. How can we maintain a rigid exchange rate peg without sufficient foreign exchange reserves? It is better to simply open it up. After opening up, the exchange rate should be allowed to adjust automatically according to changes in trade balance and commodity prices. In this way, income from exports and overseas remittances will not be affected by the peg and will gradually increase, which will also help stabilize the exchange rate. However, the central bank must still adopt intervention policies in legitimate transactions in the foreign exchange market to balance supply and demand and avoid unnecessary seasonal or special fluctuations. However, this type of intervention does not require the establishment of a separate agency for public activities and can still be carried out by the central bank in secret through adjustments. Furthermore, unreasonable exchange rates should not be forcibly maintained but should be helped to find their natural level. Unnecessary fluctuations at the natural level should be prevented. If the exchange rate rises sharply after reaching the natural level, the central bank can supply foreign exchange in secret. Conversely, if it falls sharply, the central bank should immediately purchase it. Slight fluctuations at the natural level can be allowed to occur naturally without intervention. In this way, the central bank can use a small amount of foreign exchange to balance supply and demand and maintain longer-term stability.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign capital flows should be facilitated. After the opening of foreign exchange, capital flight must be prevented, but the repatriation of foreign capital and the remittance of profits must be facilitated. The economic recovery and construction in the future will depend on the inflow of foreign capital, which should be facilitated. While giving foreign capital freedom of movement will increase pressure on the exchange rate, we believe that foreign capital inflows will far exceed outflows at this time when foreign businesses are rebuilding in China, so there is no need to worry too much about this point. However, to prevent cunning individuals from seeking opportunities to escape capital, foreign capital must also go through licensing procedures before remittance.</p>
<p>Trade controls and foreign exchange controls, such double controls have caused trade to be blocked and production to be halted. Trade needs to be controlled. This is a necessary measure for countries that are lagging behind in industrialization. Having trade controls, why have a foreign exchange application and settlement system? The government's current reason for pegging the foreign exchange rate and not allowing free foreign exchange settlement is to avoid rising exchange rates, which would stimulate domestic price increases. However, the current reality is that although the official foreign exchange rate is pegged, the black market exchange rate still fluctuates, which hinders trade and exacerbates price fluctuations. Therefore, this reason is no longer valid. As for the opening of foreign exchange that we advocate, if implemented, it can achieve the following effects: (1) The problem of export prices will be solved, the quantity of exports can be increased, and import trade can also be restarted. (2) Foreign exchange does not have to go through the black market, and materials can be imported or sold to importers to import materials. (3) Funds that have already fled abroad can be given the opportunity to flow back in by purchasing materials for import. (4) A portion of foreign capital can be attracted to make up for the gap in the balance of international payments. Compared to the two, the government no longer needs to worry. For the sake of the present, we ask the government to quickly open the foreign exchange market to rescue the current economic crisis.</p>

The United States hopes that the United Kingdom will be the first to respond to Secretary Marshall's call.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] The New York Times Washington reports that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have ordered Deputy Secretary of State Clayton to prepare to go to London and other European capitals to study the possibility of the United States assisting Europe based on Secretary Marshall's recent speech at Harvard University. Clayton's trip is not to suggest a US aid plan for Europe but to listen to the opinions of European countries on how to unite and help themselves. However, Clayton may make suggestions so that European countries know how the United States hopes they will cooperate in order for the United States to consider granting large loans. According to Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard University, he called on European countries to unite in order to achieve economic self-rescue and warned them that if European countries could not agree on a common plan, the United States would not be able to contribute much more to alleviate Europe's plight. The mission of the United States is to draft a European plan and engage in friendly assistance. The United States should do its best to assist in the restoration of a sound economic system in the world in order to achieve political stability and ensure peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 12th] US officials hope that the United Kingdom will take the lead in convening a European economic conference before midsummer. The purpose of this conference is to propose Europe's needs based on Secretary of State Marshall's construction of the United States' assistance in the revival of European countries. The United States does not want the Soviet Union or its satellite countries to participate in this meeting, but it welcomes the participation of the Soviet Union and other countries if they are willing. American economists who are keen on the European situation believe that the United States' participation in the pan-European recovery plan will last for four years. It is estimated that the United States will have to pay a price of US$6 billion in the first year, and it will be reduced in subsequent years.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall Urges Europe to Take Initiative</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall today reiterated his call to European countries to unite to restore Europe's economy. Secretary Marshall said: "We support the establishment of a European economic system on which the future politics of Europe depends, but this must be initiated by Europe. Before I delivered the Harvard University speech, I did not receive any instructions or suggestions from Europe to support the aid to Europe plan." Secretary Marshall also stated that the Europe he mentioned in his Harvard University speech included the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. In other words, all parts west of Asia are included. According to Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard last week, he asked European countries to unite to formulate their economic rescue plan. He also said that this matter should be initiated by Europe, and the United States should do its best to assist in the economic recovery of Europe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 11th that if European countries can automatically determine a comprehensive plan for recovery, the United States is prepared to provide part of the US$5-6 billion required to assist Europe in restoring economic autonomy. Marshall also said that when he referred to the European recovery, he was referring to the current borders of Europe, that is, west of Asia, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the Allied countries. However, the Secretary of State did not specify whether the United States would provide financial assistance to the Soviet Union or its satellite countries.</p>
<h3>Marshall Advocates, Bevin Praises</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] London, 13th broadcast: Bevin praised Marshall's aid to Europe proposal at a foreign journalists' conference today.

At the same time, the British government stated that the British side will convene a conference of European countries to formulate a complete plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] The British Liberal Party passed a resolution at the National Conference this morning welcoming the plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall for the United States to provide economic assistance to various European countries.

<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 12th] President Truman ended his goodwill visit to Canada today and made a statement to the press, saying that the United States hopes to be friendly with every country in the world.

<h3>Atomic Energy Control - US and Soviet Differences</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] After eleven months of debate on the issue of atomic energy control, the current opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the six major points are as follows: (1) Both the United States and the Soviet Union agree to ban the use of atomic energy for aggression. (2) The United States agrees to international groups monitoring atomic energy minerals and factories, and the Soviet Union agrees within certain limits. (3) The United States agrees to punish those who illegally manufacture atomic energy, and the Soviet Union also agrees, but only allows the Security Council to enforce it. (4) The United States agrees to establish an atomic development authority to manage research and register atomic energy, and the Soviet Union opposes it. (5) Ban the manufacture of atomic bombs and destroy existing ones. The sudden country agrees, but it must be after the establishment of the management plan, and the Soviet Union agrees, but it must be before the establishment of the control. (6) The United States opposes the veto power of the five powers. The Soviet Union believes that there should be no veto power in daily management, but when voting on punishing violators, the five powers should have veto power.</p>

<h3>Cohen Urges Law-Abiding Countries to Uphold the UN Charter - Should Not Stand Idly By in the Event of Open Aggression</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Long Beach, California, 12th] Cohen, advisor to the US State Department, said in his address at the annual meeting of the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce that all law-abiding countries should have the right to protect the UN Charter and have this moral obligation. In the event of open aggression, no country has the right to stand idly by and take no action, and no country has the right to force its own concepts and lifestyles on other countries by force or threat. The United States should use all its strength and influence to assist all countries, regardless of whether they are large or small, to live in accordance with the UN Charter. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary for the United States to provide financial assistance to Europe. In the next three or four years, the revival of Europe will require 600 billion yuan each year. Unless Europe can obtain this financial assistance, turmoil and unrest will be difficult to avoid. The goals of the United States should be (1) to increase European coal production and facilitate its transportation system; (2) to supply European countries with fertilizers and agricultural implements to develop European food production, but if European countries do not abide by the UN Charter, the US economic assistance will be difficult to restore Europe.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall told the press today that the Korean provisional government is expected to be established in a short period of time in accordance with the Moscow Agreement of December 19, 1945. The US-Soviet Joint Commission in Seoul has agreed on procedures for consultation with political parties and public organizations in both the North and South of Korea. This procedure is widely circulated and comprehensive enough to ensure that the feelings of the Korean people and their constructive ideas are properly considered. I know that this consultation will begin in Seoul on the 25th of this month and will continue in Pyongyang, the Soviet-occupied area, on the 30th. I hope this development will lead to the early establishment of a unified national provisional government in Korea.</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchants Get an Inch and Want a Mile - Demand Opening of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] When Japanese traders first heard that the United States had decided to allow the resumption of civilian trade on August 15, they briefly showed normal and pleasant expressions. In the past one or two days, they have often deliberately made many pessimistic remarks and at the same time put forward excessive demands. They are not only impatient with MacArthur's headquarters controlling the permission of all imports and exports, but they are also trying to further open up foreign exchange. However, according to reporters, the following points may be possible for Japan's foreign trade after the reopening: (1) Actual transactions can only begin on September 1, and it is said that foreign merchants will get equal opportunities. (2) Civilian exports will be temporarily suspended due to pre-war foreign contractual relationships. (3) The foreign exchange rate will not be specified for the time being. (4) Japanese merchants will still pay in yen, and foreign merchants can use US dollars or other permitted foreign currencies. Trade must first be approved by MacArthur's headquarters and then executed through the Trade Agency.</p>
<h3>Soviet News Criticizes Japanese Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th] News today severely criticized the foreign policy of Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi. The report said: Ashida's request for the Kuril Islands and the desire to equip Japanese police with machine guns are only because the financial and feudal landlord classes deeply feel this need. The current entire Japanese policy violates the Potsdam Agreement on the democratization of Japan, and Ashida's statement is an inevitable result of the policies adopted by the Allied occupation authorities in Japan.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Minister of Defense Alexander told the Imperial Press Conference that Britain's security policy in the Middle East remains unchanged, and Britain's legitimate defense needs in the region will continue to be guaranteed.

<h3>Minor Uproar with French Tram and Bus Companies; Service Suspended Briefly and Then Resumed; Caused by Insult to Union Representatives; Main Protagonist of Zhang Jinhai Tragedy Becomes Target of Public Anger</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] French tram and red bus services were suspended at 1:30 PM yesterday due to an insult to union representatives by Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan, a senior official of the French Water and Electricity Company's Transportation Department, as a protest and to demand the dismissal of Mr. Kuo. The workers' emotions were very agitated. After the incident, Song, the Director of the Songshan Police Station, personally led police officers to Lujiawan to maintain order. The Municipal Social Bureau and the General Labor Union were informed and sent personnel to mediate. At 5:50 PM, the workers accepted the persuasion and resumed work first, and tram and bus services on all routes resumed.</p>
<p>The case originated when Yang Dao-sheng, a ticket seller on the French Route 24 trolleybus No. 268, was joking with No. 54, a ticket writer stationed at the Foch Road-Seymour Road station (a staff member, not a worker), during downtime on the 9th of this month because there were very few passengers on the trolleybus due to the storm in the city. Unexpectedly, this led to animosity, and No. 54 submitted a report to the company that day, stating that No. 268 had committed derelictions such as "ringing the bell before closing the door." Based on this report, the company fined No. 268 one day's salary. The next day, No. 268 negotiated with No. 54, and a conflict occurred. The company then dismissed No. 268. Upon learning of this, the union sent more than ten representatives, including No. 188, to the company's Transportation Department at 10:00 AM yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the dismissal of No. 268. Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan, a senior official of the department, stated that the company's dismissal of No. 268 was not open to negotiation. After the union representatives directly negotiated with the general manager, the company authorities agreed to retain No. 268 and withdraw the dismissal order. The representatives then turned to question Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan. According to the union, Mr. Kuo not only refused to recognize the union representatives but also threatened and insulted them with a gun. Public anger erupted at once, and the office of the Transportation Department was vandalized. Mr. Kuo was protected by union representatives and was fortunately unharmed. At about 1:30 PM, workers driving trams and buses on all routes heard the news and drove back to the factory, forming a strike.</p>
<h3>Three Demands Raised at the Provisional General Meeting</h3>
<p>The workers held a provisional general meeting and resolved on three demands: (1) Dismiss Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan and never rehire him. (2) Revise the job regulations. (3) In the future, when the company hires new employees, it should adopt an examination system. Furthermore, because Mr. Kuo was the main protagonist in the Zhang Jinhai tragedy in the French Concession eight years ago (Mr. Kuo then ran the Yihua Laundry Company, now changed to a silk and satin company), the workers also raised the slogan of demanding a retrial of the Zhang case. After persuasion from all sides, the company authorities agreed to let Mr. Kuo take a few days off before the problem is resolved to facilitate the investigation, and once the facts are clarified, the company will handle it impartially.</p>
<h3>Grain Loan Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment; Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu Testify in Court; Both Claim No Knowledge of Official-Merchant Collusion</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The sensational grain loan corruption case, previously prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, has been transferred to the District Court for trial. The case was concluded in a debate court yesterday morning at the District Court. After Judge Wu Xiangzu, along with Judges Huang Guangyu and Wu Ronglin, Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen, and Clerk Sun Yuan took their seats, the defendants in custody, Wang Darun, a grain official, and Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wu Rongsheng, grain merchants, and the defendants on bail, Ren Xingyai, a grain official, and Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, and Yang Runhui, grain merchants, were brought to court for interrogation. Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu were also summoned to testify. The interrogation lasted for a long time yesterday, from 9:30 AM to around 1:00 PM. At the end, it was announced that the debate in the case was over, and the judgment was scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 18th.</p>
<p>Crucial Points in Interrogation; Focus on Three Aspects</p>
<p>The focus of yesterday's interrogation was to investigate whether there was collusion between officials and merchants, whether there were black market interest rates in addition to the stipulated 3% interest on loans to grain merchants, and whether fees were received for introducing grain merchants. The testimonies of the defendants were the same as in the previous three trials. Subsequently, Xu Jiqing, a witness and representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the Grain Loan Review Committee, testified: "In early spring last year, there was a severe rice shortage in the city. At that time, various groups proposed that the Ministry of Food purchase rice. After discussions among President Song, Minister Xu, and Mayor Wu and Director Wu of this city, along with leaders of various groups, it was decided to implement grain loans. First, eight companies were recommended by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and then eight companies were recommended by Wan Molin, the chairman of the Soy and Rice Industry Association, totaling sixteen rice shops. At that time, the authority of the Grain Loan Review Committee was to determine various principles and review the qualifications of grain merchants for loans. Wang Darun was the chairman of the committee, but he had no authority to decide everything during the review. I have not heard of any introduction fees or review fees being charged. In addition to the personally set interest rate of 3%, I have not heard of any so-called black market interest rates, and I have no knowledge of official-merchant collusion. As for the implementation of grain loans, it was originally a good policy, and if it could be maintained until now, rice prices might not have risen so much."</p>
<p>Price Increases in Production Areas Affect Shanghai Market</p>
<p>Another witness, Xi Yushu, testified that "I was representing the City Council in attending the Grain Loan Review Committee meeting. The grain loan was initiated by leaders from all walks of life in this city to purchase rice and relieve the panic of food shortages among the people of this city. At that time, we also considered that if we only purchased from Wuxi, the price of rice in Wuxi would definitely rise, so we separately designated areas such as Changshu and Songjiang. We suggested that the government loan 3 billion yuan to purchase 100,000 dan of rice first. Yang, the Special Commissioner of the Grain Administration, requested instructions from the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance, and only 2 billion yuan was approved, with 1 billion yuan allocated first, resulting in the purchase of only 30,000 dan of rice, which was far from the original plan. After the rice merchants arrived in the production areas, the price of rice in the production areas immediately rose, and as a result, the price of rice in this city also rose. This was a natural result and not the fault of the grain loan. Supervision of grain administration personnel is the responsibility of the Ministry of Food, and the Grain Loan Review Committee does not have this authority. As for whether there was official-merchant collusion, collection of black market interest rates, and fees, I have no knowledge of any of these."</p>
<p>Defense Attorney Argues for Amnesty</p>
<p>The prosecutor stated in his closing argument that "In addition to prosecuting this case for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, if the presiding judge discovers other crimes committed by the defendants, he can also try them according to other laws." This statement was refuted by the defendants' lawyers, who stated: "According to Article 244 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if there are other crimes, additional charges should be filed. The prosecutor has not filed additional charges, and according to Article 247 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the court may not try crimes that have not been charged. As for the defendants being prosecuted for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, according to the amnesty order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day, all are included in the amnesty and should be judged innocent by your court."</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Sheng Bingji Department Store, due to sluggish business and inability to maintain operations, submitted a document to the Social Bureau yesterday requesting approval to cease operations and lay off employees. It is reported that the store has three branches in Shanghai, with 60 employees.

<h3>Rare Treasure Awaits Claim; Emerald and Diamond Necklace; Reportedly a Qing Dynasty Relic</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The District Procuratorate will begin to solicit claims for a rare treasure. If no owner claims it within a reasonable time, it will be sent to a museum for public display and exhibition. It is learned that the treasure is a necklace made of a huge amount of emeralds, diamonds, and pearls, with extraordinarily exquisite workmanship. It is said to be a Qing Dynasty relic. On December 20th of last year, a petty thief named Zhao Songbai stole it from a foreign senior military officer in front of No. 186 Nanjing Road. Because the item was too valuable to sell, it was stored at the home of Xu Deming at No. 16 Linsen East Road, where it was discovered by the Old Gate Branch Bureau, who sent the petty thief Zhao Songbai and the stolen necklace to the court for interrogation. Zhao was released this spring due to the amnesty, and the stolen necklace was sealed by the District Procuratorate in the stolen goods room. It is said that it will soon be publicly solicited for claims.</p>

<h3>Pre-War Wages Unreasonable; Wu Kaixian Discusses Worker Treatment; Sympathy for Workers Exists; Does Not Acknowledge Being Partial</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that since the decontrol of the cost of living index, there have been many sporadic disputes, but he believes that no major problems will occur. Regarding the request from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to restore wages to the end of 1936, Director Wu said that the difference between the base salary at the end of 1936 and today's base salary is indeed large, but there are various factors that have contributed to the increase, such as: (1) In the past, the wages of workers in various factories in the concessions were mostly unreasonable, such as the fact that cotton mill workers only earned two cents a day, and their low standard of living was beyond comparison. If there were labor-management disputes, the police force could be dispatched to resolve them, so at that time, it was due to unilateral oppression, and it cannot be considered reasonable.</p>
<p>The municipal government still considers agreements signed by labor and management before the war to increase salaries at the end of the year to be valid. However, during the ten years of the War of Resistance from 1936 to 1946, workers did not dare to make demands under the threat of Japanese bayonets. It was not until after the victory that workers added salaries at once last year after negotiations. Now that the industrial and commercial sectors want to restore wages to the end of 1936, they are implicitly trying to write off the agreement to increase salaries at the end of the year, which is impossible to implement. For example, if cotton mill workers were to restore their base salary to two cents a day before the war, based on the cost of living index in May, their monthly income would only be over 100,000, which is not enough to even eat bean dregs. The poverty of Chinese capital is indeed a fact, but we cannot simply find a way out on the workers' backs; we should also consider sales, raw materials, and other aspects. Now, outsiders mostly accuse me of being partial to the labor side. While it is true that I have more sympathy for the workers, I cannot acknowledge being partial.</p>
<p>Shen Dingzhen, secretary general of the China Labor Association, also said that if some factories are indeed unable to bear the burden due to business reasons after the decontrol of the index, they can invite labor representatives, announce the economic situation, and resolve individual issues through open consultation. Workers are also willing to understand the factory's situation and negotiate reasonable figures to jointly maintain the industrial crisis. Now, the industrial sector is unilaterally seeking regulations that are beneficial to itself in various ways, while neglecting the rules for the welfare of workers, which is not the attitude that we should have when studying and resolving matters.</p>
<h3>Applications for Rice Allocation Deadline on the 21st; Thousands of Applications Received; Review Completed</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Chude, secretary of the Food Distribution Committee, told reporters yesterday that applications for rice allocation for factories, schools, and charities this month will close on the 21st.

The amount of subsidized rice received per person is determined by the number of people, and is evenly distributed among the 67,000 dan. The standards for the age of the poor, large mouths, and small mouths have been set as three to fourteen years old for small mouths, and fourteen years old and above for large mouths.</p>
<h3>Families of the Officers and Soldiers Who Died on the Fubo Frigate Bivouac Overnight Outside the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Five Demands; Dispersed After a Meal</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Forty-five family members of the officers and soldiers who died on the Fubo gunboat, to demand emergency relief, petitioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday. Deputy General Manager Shen Zhongyi received them and negotiated overnight, but no results were obtained. The family members wanted to enter the bureau, but the bureau did not agree. They bivouacked overnight outside the gate of the bureau the night before, and many police officers went to maintain order. The stalemate lasted until yesterday morning.

After several consultations, the families insisted on the following demands: (1) Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, should publish an apology to the families in the newspaper. (2) Request that the administrative adjudication and judicial judgment be carried out quickly. (3) Before the above issues are resolved, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company must, at a minimum, issue temporary relief funds according to the temporary relief measures of the Naval Headquarters on April 20 (1 million yuan for officers' and soldiers' families, 600,000 yuan for soldiers' families), based on the current cost of living index. (4) The food and accommodation expenses of all family members in Shanghai from the 9th to today will be borne by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (5) In the future, the responsible persons of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company must not refuse to meet with the family members. Mr. Ge and Deputy General Manager Shen agreed to consult with General Manager Xu and reply at noon today. At 9:00 PM last night, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company treated all the petitioning family members to dinner before they dispersed.

<h3>Visiting the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works; Self-Made Streamlined Train; Four Being Assembled and Expected to Be Used This Year</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Streamlined trains, which are popular in the United States, will soon be running on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, in a style similar to the advertisements we often see in Western magazines. These vehicles are currently being manufactured by the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works. The planned train has a total of nine cars. In addition to the elliptical shape of the car body, there are many innovations in the internal equipment, such as doors and windows being insulated, using air conditioners to regulate the air and temperature inside the car, and having both air conditioning and heating, so that it will always be "as warm as spring indoors" regardless of winter or summer.</p>
<p>The seating area will also adopt a flexible design, which can be freely changed to a forward-facing or semi-reclining style according to people's preferences. In addition, the structure between the carriages will be closely connected, unlike the current trains, which have a considerable distance between them, so there is a sense of "integration."</p>
<p>As for the footboards at the entrances and exits at the four corners of the car, they can be hidden inside the car after the train starts, without revealing a trace on the outside.</p>
<p>When reporters visited the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works yesterday, they saw dozens of technicians working diligently, with four of them already being assembled. It is worth mentioning that the underframe and car body of this vehicle were all made by the factory itself.</p>
<p>According to Factory Director Lang Zhonglai and Engineers Liu Jinyi and Liu Changxia, the original plan was for the streamlined train to be completed this summer, but it was postponed due to delays in the delivery of internal air conditioning equipment. In addition to continuing to order from the United States, they are also planning to manufacture it themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to the main tasks of repairing and building locomotives and passenger and freight cars, the factory also operates by-products, such as refining coke, calcium carbide, and producing oxygen, to supply the needs of the factory and the railway. Regarding the repair of locomotives, the work efficiency was very low during the enemy puppet period, with an average of only three locomotives overhauled per month. Currently, it has gradually increased to nine locomotives overhauled per month. The US Military Advisory Group visited the factory before and gave high praise for the repair part.</p>

<h3>Unresolved Arbitration in Knitting Industry; New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Once Surrounded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The wage dispute involving hand-operated knitting machines in the knitting industry was personally arbitrated yesterday by Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The employer representatives deemed the workers' demands unacceptable, resulting in no agreement being reached. The case will be decided by the Social Bureau or referred for adjudication.</p>
<p>The silk weaving industry in Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4 submitted a petition to the Social Bureau for mediation regarding the issue of index discounts. After two rounds of negotiations, the differences in opinion between the two sides were too great, and some workers in the industry had already begun to slack off.</p>
<p>Over four hundred employees of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory also had a dispute with the management regarding the index issue the night before last. The workers once surrounded the factory premises. They dispersed after being persuaded. The matter will be mediated by the Social Bureau.</p>
<p>Workers from machine sawmills, the tea and snack industry, Tongji Underwear Factory, and Yida Dyeing and Weaving Factory submitted documents to the Social Bureau, stating that the employers were not paying wages according to the May index and requesting mediation.</p>
<p>After fearing trouble, the management and workers of the Dazhong Metal Materials Factory agreed to calculate May wages at 85% of the index, with further negotiations to be held depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the lead printing industry dispute, the assessment committee rejected the thirteen yuan and five jiao meal allowance, so the original agreement was maintained.

<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Chen Boqun, Xiangyang South Road, this city, asks) (1) It is extremely difficult to get through on the telephone in this city between 10:30 AM and 1:00 PM. Is there any remedy? (Answer) Local calls within the jurisdiction of this bureau are not difficult. However, connecting to users of the Shanghai Telephone Company is difficult because the number of relay lines between this bureau and the various bureaus of that company, including the north and south districts, is currently only 220 pairs. According to statistics, users of this bureau account for over 90% at noon. Calls to and from users of the company must pass through these relay lines, leading to congestion and difficulty in getting through. This bureau is actively seeking improvements. (2) Can the "02" dialing system be abolished? (Answer) The automatic telephone keys of this bureau and the telephone company are not the same type, so the "02" dialing system must be used. Since this bureau took over, it has drafted a detailed unified plan, but due to financial and material limitations, it cannot completely replace the keys in the short term.</p>
<p>(Xu Tiancheng, Wuxi, asks) Waiting for long-distance telephone connections takes a very long time. I hope your bureau will actively improve this. (Answer) This bureau's long-distance telephone traffic is increasing dramatically every month, but the number of circuits is limited, resulting in supply not meeting demand. We are now planning to expand circuits in the more congested areas to remedy this.</p>
<p>(Tian Lin, Nanjing West Road, this city, asks) (1) What attitude does your bureau take towards reports of deliverymen demanding tips and gratuities? (Answer) This bureau strictly prohibits deliverymen from demanding tips. In the future, if any deliveryman from this bureau demands money from users, please refuse and provide the deliveryman's number and description to this bureau for investigation. (2) Can the names of the sending locations be written in Chinese? (Answer) This bureau now makes every effort to translate and deliver them. If there are omissions, please inquire by telephone (2490-22) or by coming to the bureau.</p>

<h3>乒乓聯賽三部決戰　華聯今晚逢郵乙　滬星壓倒聯星獲一部冠軍</h3>
<p>The Second Shanghai Table Tennis League held its first division final at the Yokohama Bridge Central Auditorium at 8 PM the night before last. Admission was free, and over 800 spectators attended, making it a lively event. Shanghai Star has always been famous, and although its lineup is slightly weaker this year, its strength remains formidable. In particular, the skills of veterans Xue Xuchu and Fu Qifang can be described as exquisite. Lian Xing's Zhang Shanda is a rising all-around player. In yesterday's match against Cheng Aixin, he could have won three games, but he panicked and allowed Cheng Aixin to counterattack and win, defeating Shanda three games to two. Lian Xing's morale was affected by this loss, and they lost five consecutive matches. However, Shanghai Star veteran Li Zongpei was almost troubled by Lian Xing's chopper player Jiang Boquan. Fortunately, he managed to cope in the end and turned the situation around. In the end, Lian Xing relied on Chen Qiquan's efforts to defeat Shanghai Star's Huang Zhijun in three straight games, winning one point. However, they suffered a crushing defeat of one to six overall. Shanghai Star won the first division championship, and Lian Xing finished as runner-up.</p>
<p>Tonight at 8 PM, the two strong teams of Hualian and Post Office B will compete for the third division championship. The referees are Li Longbiao and Jiang Xiaoshi. Hualian has just returned triumphantly from Beijing last week and is in high spirits. Li Zhen's soft "toffee" chop, and Deng Xiurong and Lu Wenliang's crisp smashes, are all keys to scoring points. Post Office B has benefited from the efforts of Captain Zhang Qinghong this year, and the entire team is fighting hard, ultimately securing their qualification for the final. In today's match against Hualian, they will surely give their all to determine the winner. The results of the final the night before last are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Star) (Lian Xing) (Score)</p>
<p>Yu Cheng Fu Yongkang Three—Zero</p>

<h3>證金改繳美金債券問題　暫時准許變通辦是　在財經兩部未正式令遵以前　仍可以現金或美金債券抵充</h3>
<p>[Our report] Regarding the issue of the Securities Exchange using US dollar bonds as substitutes for deferred transaction margin, Wang Bitang and Wu Gonglu, resident supervisors of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the Securities Exchange, received a temporary notice from the two ministries yesterday. They immediately prepared a document to forward to the Securities Exchange, ordering that before official instructions are received from the ministries, the part of the margin substitutes can temporarily still be replaced by cash or US dollar bonds.</p>
<p>According to the second instruction of the two ministries on the payment of bonds, it was limited to before the 16th of this month, and all parts of the margin substitutes had to be paid in US dollar bonds. However, brokers believe that the deadline is imminent and the reality is difficult to resolve. The council often sent Chairman Chen Jingmin, standing directors Yu Mingshi, Lin Zongjing and other three people to Beijing on the 11th to directly state the difficulties to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and hoped that the two ministries would take (1) the payment of bonds for the margin and (2) the re-extension of the deadline for submission into consideration and have a clear statement before the 16th of this month. The temporary notice of the two ministries to the resident supervisors of the Securities Exchange to temporarily implement a flexible method is equivalent to extending the current method of paying and submitting margin.</p>
<h3>公會代表晉京　面陳處境困難</h3>
<p>Chen Jingmin, Chairman of the Brokers Association of the Securities Exchange, standing directors Yu Mingshi, Lin Zongjing and other three people returned to Shanghai yesterday after going to Beijing on the 11th. According to Chen, who told reporters that this time the representatives of the Brokers Association stated the difficulties of the brokers to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. There were neither requests nor appeals. Before the trip, the approval of the Securities Exchange authorities was obtained, and the Securities Exchange issued an introductory letter. After arriving in Beijing, they met with Director Dai of the Ministry of Finance, Director Deng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the section chiefs in charge of the two ministries to express their opinions: (1) Brokers are only intermediaries when it comes to substitutes for delivered margins being changed to US dollar bonds and the amount should be paid by the customer. Currently, since the bonds are still in the promotion period, most customers have not purchased them. As a result, when the first order of the ministry arrived, the brokers and customers were not prepared, which caused the market to be temporarily short that day, and it was not that the brokers deliberately stopped trading. In addition, since the entire margin for deferred delivery has been temporarily changed to cash payment, the margin deposited by the brokers has decreased by three-quarters. Therefore, it is still hoped that the authorities will allow stocks and bonds to be used together for the sake of maintaining the circulation and credit of stocks, and that there will be a clear indication before the 16th. (2) The deadline for deferred delivery is approaching on June 30. It is also hoped that the authorities will express something before the 16th as to whether it can be extended again so that there is something to follow. However, deferred delivery transactions are now the lifeline of broker transactions. It is hoped that the government should cultivate them as much as possible. If the government is dissatisfied with the deferred delivery market, it can add strict restrictions to the Securities Exchange's business rules and avoid making rigid regulations separately. The two ministries expressed their deep understanding of the points stated by the brokers. After Chen and others returned to Shanghai, they had a discussion with General Manager Wang of the Securities Exchange yesterday and settled on remedial measures in case the order from the ministry could not arrive on the 16th. In addition, they convened a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the brokers at 3 PM yesterday to report on the progress of the trip.</p>
<h3>統債盤好　外股微升</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to perform well yesterday, with only Tong Wu slightly weak. Tong Bing opened at 7,400 yuan in the morning, with a low of 7,000 yuan, a high of 8,000 yuan, and finally hovered around 7,500 yuan. Rooms 552 and 555 sold, while rooms 533 and 503 bought, with a transaction volume of approximately 5.6 million. As a result, Jia and Yi rose by 300 yuan compared to the previous close, Bing rose by 100 yuan, Ding rose by 200 yuan, and Tong Wu was still 300 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to shine yesterday. Ewo Filature opened at 58,000 yuan in the morning, and demand from Guangbang and foreign merchants was relatively strong. The gold industry supplied, and the securities brokers went in and out because the Chinese stocks were also returning after being strong. The high reached 62,000 yuan, and then retreated to struggle at the 60,000 yuan mark. Hong Kong Shanghai Telegraph was at 15.2 yuan, with very little stimulation. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Ewo Brewery, Guang Paper, and Aviation each rose by 10%, Ewo Filature, Steel, and Wheelock Marden each rose by more than half a percentage point, and although British American Tobacco rose, it was not much.</p>
<h3>人絲買氣濃厚</h3>
<p>The market for rayon was strong again yesterday. No. 120 Asahi Ziji Youguang was in high demand from all parties and showed a straight upward trend. By the noon close, it was quoted at 18.8 million yuan. The largest price for the Toyo brand reached 9.15 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was some profit-taking at high prices, so there was a slight decline. The final price was 8.5 million yuan sold, up 800,000 yuan from the previous day. The factory price remained weak, and there were still no transactions for the high-uniformity five-dan head. The silk factory brokers' demand was very weak. Dachang satin face was quoted at 9 million yuan, and Huagang satin face was traded at 8.8 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Da Gezi Fengxiang's market was weak because there were more sellers than buyers. The middle price was 3,500 yuan. The closing price was 3,300 yuan, down 300 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>食米市况轉堅</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south markets received more than 6,400 shi of rice in total. Suburban villages and farms were more active, with indica rice being the most popular, and the market turned strong, rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Japonica rice also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan along with it. The removal of flour remained weak, and the market turned slack. Soybean cake trading was not strong, and factory cake rose sharply by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Shantou accepted yellow beans, and prices rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Northern sorghum was inquired about and accepted by distilleries, and prices soared by more than 10,000 yuan. Northern corn was purchased and prices rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Sesame was actively traded by foreign firms and prices soared by 10,000 yuan. New yuan wheat fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. The oil market, with goods from the Northeast and Qingdao, saw a slight increase in exchange.</p>
<h3>小麥貸欵　原則已核准　下週內可望貸放</h3>
<p>The government has approved in principle the wheat loan applied for by flour mills. Detailed measures are still being discussed. It is expected that the Four Joint Offices will approve it next month and implement the loan. At that time, large and small factories can apply for the loan. The flour factories are now preparing to purchase a large amount of wheat in the producing areas in order to resume production.</p>
<p>In addition, according to a letter from the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, the directors and supervisors of the association have not met with Director Wang recently. The content of the conversation reported in yesterday's newspaper has a great impact on the industry and cannot be silently accepted.</p>
<h3>食糖續跌</h3>
<p>The sugar market continued to weaken yesterday, and the inflow and outflow were also sparse. The association's opening price for Peruvian sand was firm at 575,000 yuan, and later at 568,000 yuan, down by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. No. 20 Taichung sand white was 470,000 yuan, and Taiwan red was 370,000 yuan, each down by 5,000 yuan. No. 3 half-car white was 510,000 yuan, down by 10,000 yuan. Haohuo Shantou Qing opened at 320,000 yuan to 316,000 yuan, down by 4,000 yuan. Xinghua white was 450,000 yuan to 434,000 yuan, down by more than 10,000 yuan. Xing red was 334,000 yuan, Diao Qing was 290,000 yuan, and the total transaction was less than 300 pieces.</p>
<h3>白煤疲軟</h3>
<p>The arrival of white coal is abundant, and it is difficult to sell smoothly for a while, and the trend is still weak. For the upper-grade goods of bituminous coal, such as Kaili crumbs and Fuxin layers, there are goods supplied on the market, and the market price is seeing a downturn.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks saw an improvement yesterday, but the gains were still limited to Yongsha, and the remaining stocks were just following suit. A 30% cash guarantee can temporarily maintain the status quo, and other proposals are difficult to resolve for the time being. Yongsha had repeatedly approached the limit, but was reversed before closing due to rumors of the retreat of Ambassador Su. The reason is that retail investors are still stuck with the 30% margin and cannot do what they want. The arbitrage market for Yongsha is still only around 120, and the combined interest price is only a dime. Very few transactions were made by China General Business No. 178. The agency collection and settlement number company still opens the interest price at 16.5 cents and 2.1 cents, which is very different, and the entire stock market is still waiting to be clarified. The morning opening was slightly higher, and Yongsha opened at 5,870 yuan and rose to 6,010 yuan. Nos. 226, 100, 173, and 83 were sold to 5,920 yuan. Nos. 163, 190, 155, 153, 85, and 76 took the opportunity to reach 6,060 yuan. Nos. 157, 180, 106, 83, and 65 were sold, and No. 231 even came to short sell, retreating to 5,950 yuan. Nos. 102, 97, 8, 218, 76, 234, 89, 65, 32, 218, and 14 all accepted, and the Yongsha disk rose to 6,160 yuan. At this time, many retail investors took profits, and Nos. 104, 91, and 36 were sold, retreating to around 6,050 yuan. Nos. 102, 157, 65, 32, 234, 232, 223, 153, 129, and 130 bought in unison, and Commerce was the first to raise the price to the limit by No. 157, etc. Now the US Asia delivery is also approaching the limit, and the Yongsha delivery rose to 6,300 yuan, which is equivalent to reaching 6,150 yuan. Nos. 32, 76, and 224 were sold off, falling to 6,200 yuan. Nos. 157, 32, 213, and 152 are still buying in, and Nos. 213 and 152 are also buying now Yongsha, and the delivery rose to 6,320 yuan. Now Yongsha rose to 6,170 yuan. Nos. 186, 15, and 31 were sold, falling to 6,170 yuan. At this time, No. 224 supplemented more, and New Asia also reached the limit, and then rose to 6,300 yuan. The news of Ambassador Su's return to China made sensitive people end their positions, and the selling atmosphere gradually increased for a while. Nos. 154, 76, 157, 163, 85, and 183 were all sold, and the price fell to 6,000 yuan before closing. Nos. 186 and 117 were replenished and ended at 6,100 yuan. After the close, No. 223 was sold, reducing the price to below 6,050 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Xinhua was flat, Yonggong rose by 10%, Yongsha, New Light, and Sino-French each rose by about half a percentage point, Xinhe and US Asia Jingfu Huafeng Qinxing rose slightly, Commerce rose to the limit, Cement and Wuhai rose slightly, Jinglun rose by 10%, Datong Zhongfang Rongfeng Lian each rose by more than half a percentage point, Firecracker New Asia rose to the limit and then returned, the former rose by half a percentage point, and the latter was just flat. For deferred delivery stocks, Xinguang Yonggong Jingou rose slightly, as did Huafeng, and US Asia rose to the limit and then returned, and Yongsha rose by half a percentage point. Dongxing was particularly good at 10%. The asking prices for various old stocks outside the market saw an increase, but they were still oversupplied.</p>
<h3>聯華定期上市</h3>
<p>Lianhua Real Estate Industry has been approved to be listed on a trial basis and will be launched on the 16th, with 10,000 shares as a unit.</p>
<h3>茶市未見起色</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no improvement in transactions in the foreign firms' tea market, but the market remained unchanged due to the flat selling pressure. Green tea cores, which are in demand in Tianjin, had varying asking prices, and there were few transactions. Other varieties were stably priced, as the demand from local and out-of-town buyers was continuous.</p>
<h3>到期折金存款　仍應付給黃金　財部電四聯轉知</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of paying out gold for matured gold-convertible deposits, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that gold should be paid out at the original depositing bank, and the Shanghai banks could also pay out on behalf of the original banks. It is now known that the Four Joint Offices approved the banks to send letters successively, roughly stating that the government now prohibits the sale and purchase of gold, and the Central Bank purchases it at a listed price, which is different from the previous free trade situation. How should the remaining unredeemed gold-convertible deposits of all banks be handled without clear regulations? Also, if gold-convertible depositors request to pay out legal tender at the Central Bank's listed price in the way of agency collection, can this be done? In order to make the handling of each bank consistent, please make overall coordination and deliberation. Now the Four Joint Offices forwarded the reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the payment of gold-convertible deposits is different from the trading of gold. All gold-convertible deposits handled by each bank should still be paid out in gold upon maturity to comply with the original agreement. As for the price of collecting gold, it has been approved by the Central Bank at 480,000 yuan per tael. For the payment of gold deposit certificates upon maturity, the fractional amount should be calculated according to the above price and converted into national currency.</p>
<h3>紡建估價委會　通過廿六年單價　全部估價工作需時一月餘</h3>

Those who attended were Chairman Liu Siying and committee members Li Fuxun, Liu Gongyun, Xi Yushu, Wu Yunqing, Yang Yuqing, Qin Runxiang, Ouyang Lun, and more than a dozen others.

The approved unit price will be printed and distributed to the various factories under the Textile Construction Company for filling in separately. As for the issue of the index to be added to the unit price, it will be decided by the valuation working group and then submitted for approval. The entire valuation work will take at least one month to complete.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is reported that the unit price of the main fixed assets of the Textile Construction Company in the 26th year of the Republic of China, based on spindles, including related equipment, is estimated at about 70 to 80 yuan in legal tender per spindle. Based on looms, ordinary looms are about 700 to 800 yuan per unit, and automatic looms are about 800 to 1,000 yuan per unit.</p>
<p>[Another report] Zou Bingwen, who will be the chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, attended the banquet of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association at noon yesterday at the request of the association. During the banquet, he extensively exchanged opinions on the entire cotton textile industry, and the meeting adjourned at around 3 PM. According to Zou, who told reporters after the meeting, the discussion was very good.</p>
<h3>劉泗英談　出售問題</h3>
<p>Liu Siying, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai a few days ago to preside over the Textile Construction Valuation Committee meeting, and returned to Beijing last night after completing his official duties. Before his departure, Liu told reporters that the Textile Construction Company will not be sold in its entirety. 30% will still be retained as state-owned, and the remaining 70% will be divided into the smallest units, put out to tender for sale, or issue stocks. When more than half of the stocks of each unit are issued, the rights to manage the business unit will be transferred to the commercial shareholders. As for the part for sale, it will be limited to factory buildings, machinery, and land, and the cost of raw materials will not be included. The valuation standard has been decided to be calculated according to the price index of the 26th year of the Republic of China. After the entire valuation work is completed, it will be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Liu continued to explain the purpose of selling state-owned enterprises, saying that this move is to promote private enterprises and balance the national budget. He said that the state-owned enterprises that have been decided to sell are worth 10 trillion yuan. Liu believes that the economic reform plan being studied by the All-Economic Council is based on the economic emergency measures plan, but it will remove the inappropriate parts, so the reform plan is permanent.</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>[Our report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 517 pieces, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 280 applicants.</p>
<h3>紡管會奉令撤銷　正準備接收中</h3>
<p>[Our report] It is reported that the Textile Management Committee received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week, ordering it to be abolished and prepared for takeover. Later, Director Liu of the Business Department of the committee went to Beijing to ask for instructions. It was considered that the various businesses currently handled by the committee cannot be interrupted for a day, so it was decided that the business would continue as usual, but be prepared for takeover. As for how to accept, we are still waiting for instructions from the ministry. It is heard that there are 58 employees in the committee, of which 33 are in the Business Department, and 20 of them were borrowed from the Textile Construction Company, so there will be no difficulty in personnel transfer when the handling is completed.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee has already notified the quota of each manufacturer for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the north. Applications can be accepted starting from the 16th. Since applications for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south started on the 11th, certificates have been issued and transportation to the south has begun.</p>

<h3>Reminiscences of Mr. Mang Ni</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Passing by Fuzhou Road at noon, I saw a Beijing bronze ink box at a secondhand stall. Engraved on it were plum blossoms and a poem by Mr. Mangfu. I couldn't help but recall the plump Mr. Mangfu from twenty years ago. After buying this ink box and wiping it clean, the familiar handwriting immediately brought back several past events to my mind.</p>
<p>Almost all who enjoy collecting Beijing bronze ink boxes are familiar with Mr. Yao Mangfu and Mr. Chen Shizeng, aren't they? When they enjoyed great fame in Beijing, people like Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong were still unknown! On silk fans and in studies, it could be said that the upper class of Peiping at that time was filled with Mangfu's calligraphy, paintings, and bronze engravings. The "Qianyang Chun" at the corner of Xidan Archway was also founded by Mr. Mangfu. On fine days in spring and autumn, the distinguished and elegant people who gathered there could be said to represent the height of "the capital."</p>
<p>I remember seeing Mr. Mangfu at Mr. Zhang Lianxi's house back then. He was already quite stout, and his Mandarin, heavily accented with the Qian dialect, complemented his hearty personality and his spirited writing, leaving a deep impression on my young mind.</p>
<p>After my father retired, few people visited. But in his study and garden, this plump "celebrity" sometimes came, discussing poetry and prose. The romantic scenes of moonlight and flowers have become a thing of the past, yet when I think of them now, I still have a vague sense of "dreamy beauty."</p>
<p>Because my father and Mr. Mangfu were childhood friends, I often saw Mr. Mangfu and Mr. Shizeng and other seniors when I was young and attending my father. Unfortunately, not long after Mr. Mangfu passed away, my father failed in an investment and owed debts to the Zhongfu Bank, which plunged the family into bankruptcy. As a result, my father had to travel and make a living alone. Because there was nothing of value left in the house to pawn, one day, I was sent to Liulichang with a scroll by Mr. Mangfu, a double-sided folding fan, and a volume of his early poems. In the end, under the hateful faces of the merchants, the scroll and fan were bought for two dollars. I clutched that volume of Mr. Mangfu's early poems, which they called a forgery, and returned home with a feeling of infinite sadness.</p>
<p>More than ten years passed quickly in the midst of war. Once, in Mr. Xiong Foxi's Pomegranate Garden in Guilin, we talked about Mr. Mangfu, and everyone sighed with regret for him. Thinking of my cousin XX, who relied on selling Mr. Mangfu's old books to make a living, now that he is wealthy and prominent, I suppose he doesn't have many of his ancestor's remaining works left either?</p>
<p>Foxi also told me a little anecdote about Mr. Mangfu:</p>
<p>On the opening day of Qianyang Chun, the city of Beijing was truly buzzing. Old painters like Wang Mengbai each brought very valuable masterpieces as congratulatory gifts. Almost everyone had arrived, except for Mr. Shizeng, which puzzled everyone.</p>
<p>According to the private friendship between Mr. Mangfu and Mr. Shizeng, he should not have been absent today, and everyone guessed that Shizeng would definitely bring a valuable gift, so the host and the guests were very concerned.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Shizeng did arrive, and as everyone expected, he brought a carefully painted large scroll. Everyone urged the host and Mr. Shizeng to open the central hall and take a look. It turned out to be a famous work by Shizeng; on the six-foot painting, there was a large wine jar with a branch of Osmanthus hanging down. The Osmanthus seemed to be intoxicated by the aroma of wine, and the flowers fell into the jar:</p>
<p>Such a famous painting naturally impressed everyone; especially the host, Mr. Mangfu, who was delighted. He eagerly asked those present to inscribe poems on the painting and hung it in the center of the hall. This respectful attitude towards Shizeng, compared with the literary world's habit of mutual disparagement among scholars, could not help but make people feel emotional.</p>
<p>Two years later, Qianyang Chun went out of business due to poor management, and the manager secretly ran away; but this manager did not touch any money or property, he only stole Mr. Shizeng's painting from the center of the hall. At that time, Mr. Shizeng had already passed away, and Mr. Mangfu naturally felt very sad. He offered a reward of four hundred dollars and finally found the painting.</p>
<p>Seeing the painting returned to its owner, and at the same time adding a feeling of remembering someone through an object, Mr. Mangfu wrote the whole story of its loss and recovery on the side of the painting. In this way, Qianyang Chun reopened, and of course the painting was still hung in its original place.</p>
<p>It's truly a matter of coincidence, Qianyang Chun unfortunately went through a second liquidation. Strangely enough, the manager stole the painting as usual, which made Mr. Mangfu very distressed. We can imagine that under such circumstances, the blow to his spirit was a hundred times greater than the closing of Qianyang Chun!</p>
<p>Later, this painting did not reappear until after Mr. Mangfu's death. Unfortunately, during the war, no one ever heard any news about its whereabouts.</p>
<p>Today, when the scholar-official spirit and the style of the celebrities have been abandoned, not to mention the sorrow of the death of both the person and the zither, even the White Stone Old Man, who was more recent than Mangfu and enjoyed great fame in the contemporary era, felt that his exhibition in Shanghai after ten years of dust was somewhat crude and shoddy. In today's world, when "the rituals of the Han officials are no longer seen anywhere," I can still afford to buy a Beijing bronze ink box painted by Mr. Mangfu in my spare time, which cannot help but remind me of the past like smoke.</p>
<p>I don't know from which declining family this ink box flowed into the city, and as for me, I have lost too many books and manuscripts in the war, and I cannot guarantee that I will always be able to preserve it. Looking at this ink box with its "face full of mist and clouds," and the inscription on it: "In it, there is boundless fixed flower light, the spring air is smoky and contains a special fragrance; where is the guest in the half-sleeved yellow shirt, a long flute fills the building with frost," I immediately think of how this is exactly the season of: "Playing the jade flute in the twelfth tower, plum blossoms fall in the fifth month of the river city." And in Shanghai, let alone poets and writers, there is also some air of young rascals from foreign concessions.</p>
<p>Mangfu's landscapes mostly depict layered trees stacked with green, with a majestic spirit and a high and ancient style, unlike today's splashed ink, which lacks scholarly atmosphere and looks vulgar at a glance. His calligraphy is very similar to that of Yuan Hanyun, and both benefited from Zheng Sucan; however, the early regular script calligraphy of Mr. Mangfu stored in my house is based on Zhao Songxue, and its profound skill is also extraordinary.</p>
<h3>Record of Chen Wangdao</h3>
<p>— Yao Tianyu</p>
<p>Mentioning Mr. Daowei invariably makes one think of his nickname (given to him by others), "Crooked Mouth Daoist." Indeed, his appearance is quite lacking. But if we were to measure him with an attitude of "judging people by their appearance," we would be "missing Zi Yu." Because although his appearance is not outstanding, his character and spirit of scholarship are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Speaking of his character, he is truly a good old gentleman. He never offends anyone, and he also has a passion for helping others. For example, if you have any requests, as long as it is within his ability, he will never disappoint you. This is known to all who have even a single encounter with him.</p>
<p>In terms of scholarship, it is even more worthy of our admiration. He is known for his rigor in governing all kinds of learning. Taking the field of rhetoric as an example, which is the subject he has studied most thoroughly, if you have ever read his book "An Elementary Discourse on Rhetoric," you can discover that the principles of rhetoric are explained in exceptional detail and clarity, with absolutely no hint of sloppiness or carelessness. Secondly, he also has a thorough study of aesthetic theory.</p>
<p>He usually does not easily pick up a pen to write articles. Sometimes, when he writes an article, every word and sentence must go through many careful considerations. And every article, from beginning to end, is full of key sentences, with absolutely no unnecessary meaning interspersed. And the beauty of the language goes without saying. Chen Guangsheng, as a person who is proficient in rhetoric and composition, certainly has these characteristics.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen used to be the chief editor of the "Taibai Bimonthly," and the texts published in it were all personally selected by him using strict standards. Therefore, each issue was excellent and was welcomed by readers. It is especially worth mentioning that each issue contained scientific essays written in beautiful and vivid language, which other publications lacked. It is a pity that this publication was short-lived. We hope that Mr. Chen can revive it in the near future.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen used to be the director of the Department of Chinese Literature at Shanghai University, founded by Yu Youren. Under his leadership, all the professors were well-known figures in the academic and literary circles in the country, so there were particularly many students in this department. And most of the students he cultivated have now become famous writers in the literary world.</p>
<p>He is also a professor at Fudan University, and his relationship with Fudan has never been interrupted. It is said that he is still teaching at Fudan. In late autumn last year, I met him on some occasion and felt that he looked somewhat old now.</p>
<h3>Poetic Words</h3>
<p>— Shen Xianyuan</p>
<p>Poetry is fresh language, a flash of light in people's realm of consciousness; this source of light truly exists in the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore, not everything written on paper can be considered poetry, it is the reality of the universe, a complete and beautiful emotion that is most easily overlooked or cannot be captured. — Where there is life and beauty, there is poetry!</p>
<h3>A Record of Ma Zongrong</h3>
<p>— Li Rongru</p>
<p>Ma Zongrong, this brilliant name in the literary world, is a well-known old writer.</p>
<p>Professor Ma studied in France in his early years and has a profound understanding of French. In his vast works, most are translations. For example, his novel "Spring Tide," translated from French, has a delicate and concise style, and is especially rich in infinite fresh and meaningful, just like a beautiful prose poem, making it impossible to put down once read. He is a famous old professor at Fudan, and the courses he teaches are the history of fiction, French, and Freshman Chinese.</p>
<p>When he lectures, he uses humorous and interesting language. He usually cites examples from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to explain profound and boring theories in a simple and easy-to-understand way, which is very popular among students.</p>
<p>It is said that writers from ancient times to the present have mostly been unkempt; either their faces are full of thought, or their hair is disheveled, and they are unrestrained. Some say this is affected, while others say it is transcendence and should be the lifestyle adopted by writers. However, our old writer is not like this. He wears a neat suit, carries a shiny cane, and walks to and from school with a lively spirit. That serious and neat gentleman's air cannot help but give people a feeling of respect.</p>
<p>He lives in the Fudan faculty dormitory, a small Japanese-style house, which is arranged in an orderly manner. When the author visited him last time, the desk was full of dictionaries and reference books, and he was diligently translating the famous French book "Zola's Biography"! He is a very eloquent speaker and can talk about everything from life and the universe to trivial matters between men and women, talking for hours.</p>
<p>His temperament is very upright, and he criticizes things that he doesn't like without hesitation. Although he is already fifty years old, his heart is still young.</p>
<h3>About Hong Weifa</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wuchun</p>
<p>Introducing the author of "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou"</p>
<p>Among the works in the Shen Bao Spring and Autumn, Hong Weifa's "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou" is also a popular one. Taking this opportunity to talk about his character will probably be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, he is an old Yangzhou native, a true Yangzhou expert. Anything related to Yangzhou, whether ancient or modern, can be found on his bookshelves. He has a small family with a large number of people, and the house, which should be enough, is mostly occupied by his bookshelves, forcing his family to move to the corners of the walls.</p>
<p>When he was studying in middle school, his math and science grades were very good. Because he couldn't afford foreign books, he had no choice but to study "zhizihu zheye" in college.</p>
<p>He has been a minor bureaucrat. Not that he was impatient with signing papers and working, but the political atmosphere in China didn't suit him. He has a conscience, justice, and a brain full of ideas. Regarding a certain matter, he sometimes seemed to want to add a bit of "I think." He knew deeply that "the Way cannot be practiced," so he had to voluntarily return to a career in education.</p>
<p>He is an expert in literary stories and has published specialized books "Selected Stories of Chinese Literati" and "Talking About Literati." Indeed, there are few literati, not only in official Chinese history but even in unofficial histories, novels, poetry talks, and lyrics talks, who have even a few words to pass on that he does not know. Zhang Chunshui, Bao Xiyang, Cui Huangye, Guan Xinghua, talking about them is always like talking about his old friends. If you mention Ruan Yuan to him, he will immediately say "When Ruan Yuan was poor—" and immediately tell you a long string of stories that people don't easily know. Once, the author was walking with him in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang, passing by the old site of Mi Fu's tomb, he walked and told me the story of Mi the Madman, one after another, like sawing wood, ceaselessly. If he were to be a guide to famous places, he would not only make people enjoy the scenery but also make them happy.</p>
<p>He is a standard teacher. During the War of Resistance, he always taught in northern Jiangsu. The school he was in—the First Provisional Middle School of the Province—was the truly first good middle school in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, every intellectual in the areas of northern Jiangsu under the control of the central government knew about "Teacher Hong." "Teacher Hong" became his nickname. Every student was afraid of him and respected him. His guiding principle was "Being a person first," and he never hesitated. He is truly a traditional teacher who is "awe-inspiring to look at, yet gentle to approach." Because today's teachers' standards are too "that" and students are too democratic, making it inconvenient to be jointly responsible, he has no intention of talking about "the troubles of people."</p>
<p>He writes excellent lyrics. His lyrics are not easy for superficial people to understand. He specializes in putting effort into the four words "deep, melancholy, pause, and cadence," which is the lyric law revealed by Mr. Chen Yifeng of Dantu, the great master of Chinese lyric criticism, in his masterpiece Bai Liangzhai Lyric Talks. Therefore, appreciating his lyrics requires the effort of secretly chanting and quietly humming.</p>
<p>His old poems are also not bad, and at the same time, he is a theorist of old poems. He has published three works: "On Quatrains," "On Regulated Verses," and "On Ancient Poetry." To see his prose, "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou" can be used as a sample.</p>
<p>He possesses the traditional characteristics of Chinese literati: a fondness for wine. Mentioning wine to him is like talking to a high school boy about his girlfriend, determined to get her and determined to get drunk. Believe it or not, before sitting down, he seems to already be three parts drunk when he sees the shadow of the wine pot. He has the appearance of being drunk without drinking; I see it in this person. Accompanying him during regular meals is often an exquisite ancestral small wine pot. His entertainment, fantasies, inspiration, and even his world are in that small wine pot. After getting drunk, clouds and mists flow out and become chapters. I'll tell you a secret, at this time, if you want to discuss any issue with him, it will definitely work: "Good, good, good," he says, squinting, "There is no problem in the world that cannot be discussed. Hehe!"</p>
<p>When he goes to a friend's house, he especially likes to praise the wife unconditionally (whether she is worthy of praise is another matter). His secret is not to praise all aspects of the wife, because general "good, good, good" sounds perfunctory; it is to praise a certain aspect of her, so the wife believes that she has a superhuman trait and is proud of herself. Even if she is so poor that she has to cut her hair, she is happy to welcome this guest. The words of praise he uses are, for example: Mrs. Wang's self-made cheongsam pattern is better than that of a dressmaker; Mrs. Li's braised crucian carp soup is fresher than in a restaurant; Mrs. Lin's self-created perm style is most in line with artistic requirements... and so on.</p>
<p>But what does his standard wife look like in his mind? That is the five-character truth he has gained after decades of experience and after thousands of trials and tribulations: "Speak less and smile more."</p>
<p>He also plays a pathetically small game of mahjong, but he plays mahjong for the sake of playing mahjong, not at all careless. He always puts on a research-style reserved attitude, often thinking three times before firing a shot.</p>
<p>The author has been insulted by puppet soldiers and traitors and often wants to retaliate. He does not advocate it. He says: "In today's world, one only seeks to survive; today you cannot kill the monsters and demons, tomorrow they will still become authorities, Chinese bad people have the most ways, hey hey!"</p>
<p>In his youth, he acted according to books and offended many people. "People all say I am more flexible," he says, "You should know that I hardened my heart and deliberately lowered my moral standards in order to gain these two words of flexible." Finally, he sighs: "Alas!" This sigh is probably the common sigh of many middle-aged people?</p>
