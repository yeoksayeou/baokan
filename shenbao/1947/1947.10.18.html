<h3>公用事業調整價格問題</h3>
<p>近日上海公用事業正醞釀調整價格。據公用局消息，本次請求調整價格的公用事業，有電力·煤氣·電話·公共汽軍·輪渡·小火車等，除自來水暫不變動外，可說是全面調整。上次公用事業調整價格，係七月一日，因爲調整的標準尙公允，故調整後對物價的影饗並不過大，市民雖感負担增加了，也能原諒公用事業的困難。據說本次醞釀中的調整，價格寬增至一倍以上，最高甚至有達二二倍者。尤其是電力公司要求的「自動調整」，擬定的增價標準更屬可驚，政府當局尙未予以核准。這是今犬上海公私機關行號，以及四五百萬市民所一致電視的問題。</p>
<p>公用事業係爲社會人羣服務的事業，對於都市社會人民的衣食住行，有生活上的影饗，法不能與普通商菜一概而諭；而况公用事業與一般經濟建設，社會安定，息息相關，更須作鄭重的考慮。例如郵電鐵路，由國家經營，其目的在便利人民，防止龔斷。郵電鐵路使用愈廣，則人民知識交換和消息傳達的機會愈多，市塲調劑與互通有無的機會亦愈大，其靈便固不限於使用郵電鐵路者本身。電力即電氣事業，係以供給電燈·電熱。電力爲經營之事業，它不僅爲家庭生活所需，並且是工礦生產的動力。煤氣·電話·電軍·汽車等，同爲人民所需的動力，其使用目的與郵電鐵路相同，與中小市民的關係尤爲密切。公用事業的種類很多，隨都市文明而發展。公用事業的創立和管理，無論國營或民營，官辦或商辦，其本身具有服務精神，且政府又特予專利，自不應純以營利爲目的；這應該是沒有疑問的。</p>
<p>因爲公用事業以服務爲目的，與人民生活上的衣食　行，息息相關，所以政府必須加以管制。管制並非壟斷，也非阻過，其目的在以控制價格的手段，防止其自由加價。有一時期，政府對公用事業實行補貼政策，相當延緩了其他一般物價的漲風，後來放棄了補貼，只用消極方法來控制，無異放任其自由漲價；於是水漲船高，一般商人不免又向公用事業漲價「看齊」。本次各公用事業公司，以外碼增長燃料漲價藷理田，決定自動調整價格，要求標準很高，調整方式也似欠台理。市政府對此，並無意見，僅轉請全國經委會和經濟部核議；而代表民意的市參議會，在通過節約用電，徵收很高罰款一案以後，也沒有對公用事業提高價格有過詳盡的對論。在今天這個困難局國下，核准公用事業增價，則人民負担實太沉重；不核准增價，公用事業又感吃力。因此，政府的處理很謹愼，而結果仍不免於准許，祇是採取何項標準，規定漲價限度的問題而已。而普通市民所關心的，也就是這個漲價限度的問題！</p>
<p>照我們想，補貼辦法固因國庫不勝負擔而覺得不很妥當，但任其自由漲價，對人民負擔也影響太大。都市公用事業，原則上固應由市民負擔，不過今天市民直接的負擔太多，值得考慮。請市政府切勿忘記：公用事業收費所附加的一成市政建設捐，究竟作了什麽用？可否用以貼補若千公用事榮？在政府方面，不必要的行政支出和浪費，可以取消；而對中小市民關係最切的歲項事業，應以收入相審補助，實有必要。在各項公用事業方面，慼認識時艱，在管理上，也要儘量節省，避角浪費，增漲更須有標準，有分寸。否則各種物便彼此刺激，循環飛躍，市民的負擔既困苦，而公用事榮失去了服務精神，也是不應該的事！</p>
<h3>展開中的節約運動</h3>
<p>節約運動，巳由理論漸見諸事實，各方均在分別推動了。其在本市，除禁舞一項的實施辦法尙在請示中央外，其餘若紙張的節約，筵席的限制，以及守時運動等，俱已陸續正式實施。各方面對於這事的態度，雖沒有根本的歧異，但其觀點却不盡相同。有的着重在整飭風紀這一點上，以爲世風太奢侈，太淫靡了，應當及時矯正一下；有的注重在軍事方面，以爲常此動員戡亂時期，根本不應該過於享樂。此次實行節約的動機，由於總動員綱要而來，政府意向所在，或亦不難於此窺見一斑。不過我們的意見，這項運動的主要因素，與其說是社會的，軍事的，終不如說是經濟的較爲適當。</p>
<p>近來物價的漲風，橫衝直撞，漫無止境，弄得人心皇皇，岡知所指。此中原因雖多，而　結所在，要不外於物資不足。因爲供給倘無問題，則人心不會恐慌，投機不會猖獗，黑市不會出現，縱使通貨膨脹，幣值低落，亦不會使漲風形成瘋狂的狀態。據統計上的表示，現在物價指數的倍數，遠過於法幣增發的倍數，可知物價之所以飛漲，一面固由於幣值的低落，而另一面究在於物資的缺乏。</p>
<p>物資何以如此缺乏？簡單說來，不外於　生產萎靡，　運輸不暢，和　進口遭受到嚴重的限制。這幾種故障，短期內，恐皆無順利解決之望。就第三點而論，要求這口增加，不得不求外匯頭寸的增加，即不得不先求出口貨物的增加。所以英日等國，都在勒緊褲帶，實行其「飢餓出口」政策。困為不出口，不能獲得進口，不進口，就不能充裕其　生物品。所以節約運動的作用，不單是消種的，同時亦實在是積極的。</p>
<p>現在各國，都在努力推動此項運動，不問他是否借得到美元，不問其國內有無戰亂，亦不問其本國物資是否缺乏，就因爲消極的省吃儉用，希岡緩和其缺乏的嚴　情形而外，還帶着種稱積極作用之故。上面所說增加出口，交換進口，不過此種作用之一。他若抑制物價的漲風，减輕通貨的膨脹，平衛國家的預算，安定人民的生活，以及復興經濟，援助他國等等，根本上，都不能不從限制消費入手。所以單把節約運動，看作裁節廳費，整飭風氣的手段，未免過於低佔了「節約」的價值。</p>
<p>對於當前的經濟混亂情形，無人不　着憂慮，亦無人不想拿出切實辦法，打破遵重難關。諸如增加生產咧，穩定幣值咧，這誠然都是救時的要圖；不過施行起來，要求其迅速而普徧，立刻可以做到，人人可以致力的，却莫過於節約這一途。大家愼弗輕視了牠，以爲道不過是一句老生常談，不足介意，亦愼弗過於寬偎了自己，以爲一人一家的享用，無關於國家大局。須知英法日等國所宣佈的種種經濟緊急揩置，雖然煌煌鉅製，綱舉目張，而求其重點所在，亦無非先要大家切實儉省，　濟時艱罷了。</p>
<p>有人以爲民生困苦，至此已　，許多人民早已　　　　　上，實已無約可節，這話自係事實。不過目前生活，榮枯逈殊，享用太不平等，誠如古詩所稱：「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」。在朱門一類階級，自應去奢祟樸，力求節約，爲國家多保留一分元氣，即所以緩和一般瀕於饑餓綫上的怨忿！</p>
<p>抑節約的推行，不應偏重在民間；凡以身作則，爲民表率這一類話，早經有人提過，毋庸贅陳。然而裁併駢枝機關，汰除冗濫人員，以及删减不必要的支出等節目，雖經當局愛次議決，通飭實行，而事賓上的表現，往往藉口種種理由，把決議東諸高閣，殊未能盡符一般人的理想。相反地，有一部份特殊的公務人員，窮奢極慾，月費數千萬，俱由公家開支，此事曾見諸官文書，當非盡屬子虛。所以對於節約這運動，我們有兩點極重要的建議：　須官民一致推行，尤其亨用過分的達官巨　，應當本克己精神，先做點榜樣出來。　一切實施辦法，仍應依據事實，愼重擬訂，特論愼勿過高，以免望礙難行，依舊變成了一篇官樣文章。</p>

<h3>魏德邁呼籲援華</h3>

<p>渠繼種:「即使如此，我儕美國人民應贊助中國人民改善其文化情况之動機，並支持其明智而實際地皋加彼等之政府。余保留余之信心，即蔣主席對實踐此等目標確具誠意，如外國（特別係美蘇兩國），能予以援助或干涉，蔣主席之能達成此項目標，必將大有進展。遠東戰後之情形與歐洲相似，具有混亂之經濟，政洽上之分裂以及廣泛之覺醒。蘇聯在此區內充份利用無組織及動亂之情形，一如其在歐洲所爲。</p>

<p>﹝聯台社成功湖十七日電〕今日據悉：美國即將向聯大會正式提出朝鮮獨立方案，以答復蘇聯同時撤兵要求，並已將該一方案預先通知中英蘇三國。其中建議逐步實踐戰時盟國恢復朝鮮獨立之諾言，要求聯合國機構遵守此項程序，指派一委員會監視朝鮮選舉國民議會，然後設立政府，再由美蘇兩國與朝鮮政府協商撤兵事宜。但美國將拒絕由聯合國機構直接監督，認爲主要責任屬於中美蘇英四國。至於反對立即撤兵與其反對英軍立即退出巴勒斯坦一節相類，蓋欲避免在朝鮮造成眞空，引起混亂。</p>
<h3>英代表瓊斯重申決心　願早日退出聖地　拒絕單獨執行聯大方案</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十六日電﹞英殖民部大臣瓊斯今日吿聯大巴勒斯坦委員會稱，英政府願意明白宣示其終止巴勒斯坦委治，及在限定期間內退出巴勒斯坦之決意。吾人認爲聯大於決定解決方案之性質時，並應決定實施方案之方法，若責成英政府單獨負責巴勒斯坦之行政，及執行聯合國機構認爲必要之改革，未免不合理。</p>
<p>聞已有建議由聯合王國在巴勒斯坦充分獨立前之過渡期間，在美代表等所提之協助計劃下，以負責執行聯合國機構之政策者。英政府於茲欲明白聲明，英國不但已決定終止巴勒斯坦之委治，且決於一定之期限內退出巴勒斯坦。但英政府願意：　於猶阿成立解決後，由英國在有限的過渡期內，綱續巴勒斯坦之行政；　考慮應邀會同其他聯合國會員國，參加解決辦法之執行。總之，英政府決不接受單獨或極大部份之責任。</p>
<p>阿集團代表作最後反抗</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十六日電﹞阿拉伯國家正作最後抗戰，擬將可能之聯合國分治巴勒斯坦之決定，移交國際法庭審理。敍利亞埃及代表在巴勒斯坦委會中提出建議，主張在國際法庭判定聯合國是否有能力決定此事前，聯合國應暫緩表決。</p>
<h3>聖地分治問題　辯認吿結束　贊成反對兩派實力相埒</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十七日電〕聯大巴勒斯坦特委會一般辯論，昨也已吿結東。關於聖地分治問題，根據演說紀錄，十四國贊成，十二國反對，兩派實力相等，頗難軒桎。分治方案最後命運如何，胥視未發言之卅一國意見而定，但在表決以前，彼等或不致宣佈其立塲。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會下週一召開安理會理事之爭待解泱</h3>
<p>﹝路透社成功湖十六日電﹞聯合國大會已定於下星期一標準時間下午四時及八時，召開全體大會，恢復舉行投票，解決印度與烏克蘭就安理會所遺一席理事之爭，在上月之全體大會中，就此席理事已嘗舉行九次投票，印度及烏克蘭均不獲汰定多數票而無法解決。可靠方面謂印度準備正式提出所謂非常任理事依地理位置分配之原則。聯合國人士相信，捷克有能同意繼波蘭擔任理事，則此次爭執當不致發生。</p>
<h3>小型大會案蘇集團一致反對特別嚴注安默特朗計劃</h3>
<p>﹝聯爲社成功湖十七日電〕聯大政委會今日機續討論馬歇爾所提設立常務委員會一案。昨日會讓中，印度荷籣希臘瑞典均在原則上表示支持，但波籣白俄羅斯則與斯拉夫集團一致表示反對。</p>
<p>﹝中央社成功湖十六日電﹞斯拉夫集團今正式提及一般人士廣泛討論之外交季刊編購安默特朋提出之所謂「安默特朋計劃」。該計劃大抵建議　聯合國若千會員國成立谷國均可參加之補充協定，規定參加者需實行憲　中規定抵禦武力侵略之義務；　此項協定，經三分二以上簽字國家決定，根據憲章規定需要其體行動，而安理會未能行動時，即可實行。安氏之計劇，聞獲有范登堡及美外交界其他若干有力人物之支持。由白俄羅斯所作之攻擊觀之，克姆林宮方面對此計劃之各方面，顯甚關注。</p>
<h3>美共和黨二巨頭要求强化聯合國</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社俄亥俄州哥倫在十六日電〕共和黨總統競選人史泰遜及塔虎脫本日一致認爲世界和平並未喪失。史氏稱民主黨爲「隱憂黨」，並要求强化聯合國，以援助世界能在和平中共同生活。塔氏指斥駐聯合國之蘇聯外交人員，惟稱聯合國「仍爲將來世界和平之希望。」</p>
<h3>美英所頒賠償計劃　德各黨一致抗議　拆卸工廠英美表示令出必行</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電﹞柏林電台稱：總境英軍區德人顧問委員會，爲抗議今日公在之英美賠償計劃，於今衣在漢堡開會，決定停止工作。英軍區德人顧問會之全體大會，各委員爲表示抗議，不顧英軍政府之願望，集團退出會塲。</p>
<p>又訊，德左右翼政黨一致反對賠償計劃，漢堡之企業家，經濟學者，及工會領袖咸恐此計劃將使漢堡市趨於蠻息。基督民主聯盟及基督社會同盟黨聯委會秘書長稱，此一賠償計劃爲干涉德國之經濟生活，其後果一時尙無法佔計。北萊茵成斯特法里共黨總部亦發表聲明，謂工廠之拆卸將嚴重影饗民主建設之經濟基礎，以及以製成品抵作賠償之可能性。漢堡區英專員培萊已警吿漢堡政治領袖及工會人士，謂若以消極抵抗或罷工方法抵制拆卸，將一被歐洲國家視為德國不願俊悔之表示。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社柏林十六日電﹞英美軍政府今日計劃拆卸德工廠及兵工廠六百八十七所，以充賠償，此一計劃志在必行，不管德人方面之反對。拆卸工作當儘速完成，以加速歐洲經濟復興。美佔領區僅剩六十九廠待拆，預料不致橫生事端，美軍司令海斯鄭重聲明，令出必行，「最後不惜利用兵力」。</p>
<h3>日內閣秘書長指責保守新黨</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十七日電﹞內閣秘書長西尾十七日於大阪接見新聞記者團，就最近之政情，闡明政府方面之見解稱：「最近自由黨總裁吉田認爲日本爲準備參加和會，必須創立保守新黨，成立由單一政黨組織之强力政府，因而要求於和會前實行總選舉。惟政府以爲無此必要。</p>
<p>希望各黨協力不欲解散議會</p>
<p>蓋即使實行總選舉，而社會，民由，國協，共產等現有各政黨，亦皆與保守新黨同時並存，不致消滅，而參加和會所必需之眞正舉國一致之政府，則依然不得不成立與現在同樣之聯合內閣，故現政府在此此立塲上，惟有希望在野黨參加政府，而不考慮解散議會，實行總選舉。</p>
<p>應付勞動攻勢政府具有自信</p>
<p>其次，最近外間盛傳十一月將有政變說，此全屬無稽之謠言。其所以有此謠傳者，係由於認爲至十一月間，以改正一千八百之基準工資爲中心，勞動者之攻勢將趨激化。惟現佔工會過半數之總同盟堅決支持片山內閣，故勞動攻勢亦可解決。何况追加預算亦預定止於約八百億圓之限度，因此更無通貨膨脹激化之處。</p>
<p>黨內左派問題即可獲致諒解</p>
<p>再傳本人與平野農相對立，巳招致閣內之不統一，而社會黨內部即將發生料紛；本人今特聲明，此事相信近日可獲諒解。此一問題係由在對於社會黨左派之處理上意見略趨對立，因平野農相謂左派始終爲左派，慼與之絕緣，但事實上由四周情勢之變化，已無所謂左派，吾人將可能與其協調此乃常然之事也。</p>
<h3>史達林對英議員表示　蘇願與西歐合作　希望團結力量從事建設</h3>
<p>〔路透社華沙十七日電﹞史達林於本星期初在黑海岸之沙基接見英國左翼工黨議員時，曾吿以「蘇聯並不願有鐵慕。吾人若團結力量以從事復興建設，鐵幕即不致存在。」據議員團人員透露，史選林曾表示，須由英國及西歐國家在經濟上與蘇聯及東方民主國家合作。合作可以驅逐戰爭惡魔。據英議員談：「吾人至捷克，南斯拉夫，蘇聯等訪問後，益信有與東方國家合作之必要。吾人發見蘇聯準備並　意與英簽訂商約，吾人深盼此一談判得以恢復。」</p>
<h3>遠東法庭釋放日本戰犯　檢察長說明原因　謂日皇及實業界並無戰爭罪行</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京十七日電﹞自月前東京軍事戰犯法庭檢察官宜佈日本甲級戰犯二十三人予以不起訴處分後，各國人士均有指摘。國際檢察團撿察長季補特就此事在「日本時報」發表談話，認爲日本之實業家並無製造戰爭之罪行。</p>
<p>季氏謂；日本天皇及實業界人物，現在已決定不受戰犯之裁判。此事在過去二年中，曾引起若干爭論，現在已告結束。日本之實業家並無充份證據足認彼輩應負戰爭責任。雖有若干議論認為日本天皇及主要實業家應受戰犯之裁判，但經過長期調查之結果，此項議論並不能發現正當之理由。吾人手邊並無人提供之日本實業界產業界主要人物計劃或開始共同協議參預戰爭之實例，此補證據亦無從　集。當然語人亦不願無條件的宣佈某某一個集團一全體均爲無罪，經考慮之結果，認爲應在戰爭開始時曾有參加策劃之行爲者，始爲吿發之對象。現在審判中之東條等二十五名戰犯嫌疑者中，無一實業界中人物，此事並非偶然。日本實業家與德國之實業家不同，在德國如希特勒騎在馬上，產業界人物則牽馬　，但日本的銀行家或工商業指導者之牽馬　，係受槍桿所脅迫云。</p>
<h3>日本輸出品將提高價格　國庫不再貼補貿易資金</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京十七日電〕日本對外貿易恢復棧，貿易資金問題已使大藏省當局惑覺應付困難。據悉：去年度（一九四六年度）即已短三十餘億日圓，依目前輸出入情形，至本年年底，將虧一百六十餘億日圓之鉅。彌補之方，惟有將轍出品價格提高，面將糧食等輸入品價格减低。消費品則仍照國內現價，以消費者多付之價格，補償貿易損失。現貿易廳與大藏省雙方正在協議中。又貿易廳方面正研究提高輸出品之方法，將比照外國市塲價格，以決定折合日圓之比率。有提高價格可能之　出品，今後決定捷高。日政府同時決定國庫所負担之對外貿易費金，今後不再繼續負担。貿易資金將完全由貿易價格之調整上求其平衡云。</p>
<h3>英緬條約定期簽訂</h3>
<p>﹝路透社倫敦十七日電〕此間今日正式宣布：英緬條約將於十月二十日由共人德禮首相及緬總理泰金諾在此簽字。移轉緬政權之正式程序，特於於下過英讓院開始下屆會議時開始。</p>
<h3>美加緊援法將發交鉅額金銀歐洲代表再促美國援助</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社輩盛頓十七日電〕消息靈通方面稱，本週末法國可望自美國獲得新財政協助，分得盟國手中軸心國所掠奪之金銀，數約値九千萬至一億美元。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕「馬歇爾計劃」二歐洲領袖今日聲言：美國之適當的援助有不及時給予，則歐洲前途將爲眞正的災患。此兩人即歐洲經濟合作會議執委會主席弗朗克斯及秘書長阿爾芳。據弗朗克斯稱，此次巴黎會議之報吿係以一九四七年歐洲之經濟水準爲根據，其後局勢益劣，使馬歇爾計劃之順利實現愈趨困難。</p>
<h3>美產業職工大會支持第三黨競選</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社波士頓十六日電﹞美國產業職工大會政治行動委員會主任克洛爾十六日在招待記者時稱:在一九四八年之總統競選中，產業職工大會將支持第三黨云。</p>
<h3>法國工潮仍僵持　政府調軍隊開入巴黎</h3>
<p>﹝路透社巴黎十六日電﹞法政府已於十六日調派軍隊開入巴黎，軍隊均携有營帳及全副配備。內政府及陸軍部對此等軍隊之移動，均拒絕發表意見，殆與工潮局勢有關。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社巴黎十七日電﹞三日前參加罷工之巴黎兩個小工會，基督敎工人與自治工人團體，雖已決定復工，政府亦頗希望以之恢復擴貫巴黎之電車交通，然未果，十七日巴黎全市仍無公共交通。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社巴黎十六日電〕法國工潮今日已露解決端倪，七十萬罷工工人中巳有三千人決定復工。賴瑪油總理盡夜與各工會磋商，以便在星期日巴黎市議會選舉前，澄淸勞工局勢。</p>
<h3>西班牙政局將發生變化　反弗朗哥派活動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電﹞現在倫敦之西班牙社會黨領袖普利多，及不久將抵此間之西帝制派領袖羅勃爾斯，不久將在此會談。預料其結果，對於今後反弗朗哥派之動向，將有重大影饗。兩氏之會晤，乃西班牙內戰前夕以來之第一次晤面。倫敦西共和派人士相信兩人將討論採取共同行動，以恢復西班牙民主政權之可能性。</p>
<h3>美國新發明無綫電炸彈</h3>
<p>〔爲合衆社費城十六日電〕富關克林研究所已發明一種無綫電炸彈，無須由飛機運戰，前後組離與左右方向，均能指揮如意云。</p>
<h3>外長會議難樂觀　柏林四强機構應予保持</h3>
<p>﹝路透社巴黎十六日電〕即將繼陶格拉斯接任德境英軍政府長官之副長官羅勃森中將，十六日在柏林之記者招待會中表示，相信十一月之四强外長會，縱不能成立關於德國之協議，四佔領强國仍將繼續其目前在柏林之四國機構。</p>
<p>非以各强一致協議爲基礎，則匪特右關德國，甚至有關歐洲之一切問題，均不能有適當之解決。柏林之四强機構，爲東西間之橋樑，余不信在此四盟國之任何領袖，已具有拆除此橋樑之意。</p>

<h3>環遊世界宏揚佛敎義國高僧明起說法　堅信惟此為眞理之路</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕義大利高儈羅根那法師，日前由港來滬，卜居王佛寺，定明日起假佛敎凈業社說法。羅根那法師爲義國有數之高僧，生於義大利，但成長於美國，並獲得化學學士之學位。彼因受達摩　者一之影饗，而改變其整個人生觀，遂皈依三實，成爲一虔誠之佛敎徒。彼有一兄弟，現爲羅馬之主敎，雖爲兄弟，而各循信仰迫求眞理。</p>
<p>此次法師自緬甸，檳榔嶼，新加坡，徑香港來滬，一路說法，宣揚佛敎，並擬在滬說法後，前往馬尼刺，檀香山　前往美國。渠將在紐約設立一佛敎出版所，擬出版佛敎聖經一書，集佛敎之十全於一帙，並擬爲祈禱世界和平，於紐約建築一摩天塔，籍表現在美國宣揚佛法之精神。</p>
<p>羅根那法師曾步行橫貫歐洲南部，中亞西亞，與不少其他國家。渠於一九二五年於緬甸，經八年之隔絕慶世，坐禪悟道，乃決定周遊世界作佛法之宣揚。法師且爲世界佛敎傳道會之創立人與領導人，並曾組織佛敎佈道遠征團，領導各地敎徒參朝各佛敎名地。</p>

<p>當記者詢其對中國佛敎之觀感時，渠稱渠甚贊佩中國僧人之勤勞不懈。蓋波深信「與其任之生銹，不如磨損」之至理。法師又稱，現爲佛敎年二四九一年。當二五〇〇年時，佛敎富能臻於極舉，普照世界。現僅餘八年之時間，以努力求其實現，故對於美國說法之舉，抱深切之希望。</p>
<p>茲悉，法師之四次說法程序，爲　佛敎是救人救世的科學。　如何能夠德智　圓滿具足。　佛學是科學化的敎理。　以眞理降服私我。渠定自明日起，每日下午五時半在赫總路四一八號佛敎淨業社說法，並擬每晨在大美電台置播佛法。</p>

<h3>中央造幣故事籌補充殘缺　恢復鑄幣僅時間問題　東北機件將搬運來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北中央造幣廠，戰時損失奇重，勝利復員之初，該廠曾編一預算呈部，當時估計之復廠費用，需一〇二億元。但經財部核减爲四十五億，轉呈政院，一面先行撥下二十五億元，作爲復廠經費。嗣在宋子文出長政院任內，對此項復廠計劃批令緩辦。財部曾再度向政院要求維持原議，迄今尙成懸案。而該廠則以勝利時之預算，因物價關係，已不適用，曾於最近重編一預算，計需國幣三百億，美金二三百萬元，送呈財部。現悉財部爲適應環境之需要，並查得昔日「日滿」遺留田東北之造幣機件，足可補充殘缺，故現正向中央銀行洽商墊款四十億，作爲裝運來滬之費用。造幣廠方面亦已派員前往東北，着手調查一切，惟現因交通不便，復以時屆嚴冬，故何時起運，尙難決定。據一般觀察，認爲中央造幣廠之恢復，僅屬時間問題，將來即不鑄造金屬本幣，但鑄造輔幣，勢在必行，蓋世界任何各國，除本幣外，絕無輔幣不採用金屬者也。</p>

<h3>國煉火油不應取締　九煉油廠陳述理由可節外匯有利民生</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕物價評議會以「人造火油」之原料，採用柴油，有損柴油正當工業用途，決予取締。昨日油脂業公會永大等九煉油廠招待新聞界呼籲，略謂:「人造火油」之名稱，經木年四月十七日公用局火油管理談話會中改正，稱爲國煉火油，因舶來品火油亦係從柴油中提煉而成，今國人設廠自行提煉，經一再改進，產品已不在舶來品之下，我國一旦開發油田，煉油之設立，必將竭力提倡。今全滬大小煉油廠，共有二十餘家，工人一千餘人，均具相當規模，若遽加取締，摧毀新興之民族工業，造成大批失業工人，殊爲不智。故政府誠能增多柴油進口，减少火油進口，將一部份柴油分配各煉油廠，規定出品數量，由政府平價發售，則不特節省外匯，抑且有利民生。目前柴油售價僅四百零六萬元一噸，火油需八百卅四萬一噸，柴油中可煉得火油八成，且尙有副產礦油，遠較從外國輸入火油爲合算。最後並指出此次取締國煉火油之舉，慕後係外商策動，蓋彼輩深恐國人自煉火油後，將失其操縱火油市塲之能事，故藉詞請政府取締云云。</p>
<h3>盜賣空汽油桶案美軍事法庭開審　有關俄人返國無從追究周根壽承認受囑託轉賣</h3>

<p>未被發覺　。八月一日皮亞土第二次復　將空油桶五百四十隻，售與住南車站陳家橋益雲北里十四號之王金榮，言明價值美金一千六百元，交貨後付款，正擬由江灤機塲裝出時，被我空軍衛兵發覺，王金榮。皮亞士被扣，油桶五百四十隻全部交還天軍，而與該案有關之俄人喬其業已返國，無從追究，至第一次已付出之金條二根及一千二百美元，是否由喬其携回，或均分，或另行儲藏，則尙待偵查，又關於第一次油桶少去處，亦正在嚴密查緝中。十五。十六兩日，美軍法庭曾舉行不公開之審訊，傳問證人及有關該案之前中國空軍第二勤務大隊第二科科長陳常少校。昨日上午</p>
<p>繼續審訊　先傳前在美軍服務，現任　於德土古公司之莎古拉，供稱：本年七月間，皮亞士少校，曾囑我在出貨單上簽字，書明一千六百美元，出售汽油桶五百四十養，後即交與王金榮。此時皮之辯　人鮑第中校，即謂檢察官麥基少校不慼以照片爲證，且皮少校並未簽字，尤不應由其負責，當經承審官帕末爾上校，加以駁正。繼審皮少校之女書記伯那多，供稱：會在皮少校處，遇沙三次，並見皮與沙曾有一次極長之談話。下午審周根　，供稱：係皮少校令喬其囑其</p>
<p>設法轉賣　至收買之周姓，係我之二友介紹，本人並不認識。第二次事發後，喬其又來吿我，謂皮少校令我往中國空軍司令部，找尋主管長官，能否設汰帮忙。我赴該處後，祗見油桶，王金榮則據悉已於八月一日下午解送中國空軍總部。昨日審訊尙未完畢，今晨九時將斷續開庭，傳訊其他證人及王金榮等。</p>

<h3>筱伶貴實廿一萬萬　越劇界表示兩點　自殺非經濟困難生前無曖昧情事</h3>

<h3>寓實騐於救濟　社會部在重慶市的新設施</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十五日航訊〕住於川黔公路旁，花灘溪曲續成S形的「世外桃源」，這裏約佔三百畝面積，建築有新式房屬二十餘攤，一塊大木牌上寫着：「寓實驗於救濟，　羣倫進大問」。它使參觀者一觸目，便發覺已經踏進社會部軍慶實驗教濟院的境界了。</p>
<p>救濟院內分六部：安老所·習　所·殘疾所·育幼所·醫療所·護產所。每部有專人負責，各成一個單位。</p>
<p>殘疾教養所，現有聾啞生廿名（女五名），盲生廿三名爲女四名），跛　生廿三各（女八名）。聾啞教師芮谷風，舉業於南京盲啞學校啞科職業班。他不能講話，却能用手勢訓練</p>
<p>聾啞學生　「會話」。另一位敎發普的江明姦，殘臂斷腿，原是受救濟的難民，被院方敎義成功，也擔任着教師的職務。他說：聾啞生全用注音符號練習發音，可是四十個宇母中，仍有：兀（額），　（李），方（舊）等三個字母，發不出聲昔。即使最聰敏的聾啞生，學會這一四十個字母的發音，也得需要三個月。盲生則全賴模字了，盲字共右五十四個字母，計分子音十八個，母音卅六個，一子普與一母音相拼，即成爲一個盲字。戰前，上海中國盲民福利協會，曾用機器印製了大量的盲書和歌曲，現因經費困難，每月僅用</p>
<p>人工打字　出版「啓明」月刋一種，分發各盲啞學校應用。全中國究竟有多少盲啞聾的殘廢者，政府并沒有確實統計，但受過盲啞聾致育的殘廢者，不愁沒有出路，他們畢業後的職業：多數是神聖的教育工作。</p>
<p>安老所有卅一位男老人，（最高年齡爲八十一），五十三位女老人，（最高年齡八十九），最低年齡均爲六十歲。進所後連棺材都由院方供給。根據統計表上調查：從卅一年三月起至今年九月止，先後病逝廿四位老人。他們</p>
<p>生活安逸　睡的棚子床。釣魚·奕棋·散步·是他們的日常活動。信仰自由：設有佛堂及禮拜堂各一座，星期日由安息會楊信生收師佈道。六十二歲老人林樹森，每晚自動講演：「濟公傳」。</p>
<p>問題最複雜，工作蛟繁重的使是習藝所了。目前有八十一位男隊員，十五位女隊員，多數轉自警察局。識字的很少，但有一位陳勉之，却是復旦大學經　系畢業的。全部軍事管理，開首逃跑的頗多，現在比較少了。上午學習手藝，下午讓書識字。</p>
<p>無業遊民　可以在內學會園選·漁牧·藝造·縫級·棉識·印刷等技能。縫續部有八座縫級機，棉織部有平毯機及手巾機各四架，印刷部有石印機六架，圓般僟一架。訓練期限暫定一年，期　後由社會部職業介紹處介紹工作，仍與院方保特密切聯繫。</p>
<p>院長魏永淸博士，是位　社會工作　專家，他說：量個　家愈進步，社會救濟的範圍亦愈廣泛。中國的社會救濟正在開始，而美國則已由逍極的社會救濟，發展爲普遍的津貼救濟，貿臉救濟院目前雖然實施了院外救濟和院外治療的津貼，限於經費，不能積極推動。」這位壯年的美國留學生，還有一個偉大的崇高理想，他準備辦一所新型的——完全應肘心理學的——精神病院，可是，問題是在。從那裏來這一筆鉅款呢？</p>
<p>實驗救濟院的醫藥設備方面，計有四位醫生，十四位助產士和護士，七十張病床。隔離病房有位鍾婉芳小姐，曾在廣州中山大學肄業，她因爲院方沒有西藥</p>
<p>治療肺病　她報告魏永淸院長：有一張中藥診單，或許可以治療，但從來沒有病人試驗有否成效。她想書院方供給藥費。因爲魏院長的開明，終於化了廿五萬元，為她買回十五付藥。據鍾女士對記者聲稱：病狀確比以前進步多了她已吃了廿多天，但必須連吃三個月，才能得到確實的結果。茲將中藥診單抄錄如下以供患肺病者參考：</p>

<p>招商局不准送客上船，我是絕表同情的。因為每當開船之際，船上擁擠不堪，走這擁塞不通，都是送客的太多所致。但老弱婦　無人陪同上船，統覺有些不妥，我上次送家母和兩個小孩返甬，到了碼頭，我因無票不准登輪相送，可是家母年已七十，小孩還祇五六歲，高　的扶梯，均非有人扶持不行，而到了船上　地位，妥排行李，又非有人照料不可。那天我眼看家母　帶兩個小孩，顫顫慄慄地上去，後面的旅客推的推，擁的擁，心裏十分不安，我想旅客抱同樣觀感的當也不少，不知招商局對於老弱旅客，有否改善服務的辦法？素稔貴報爲民喉舌，銷數最廣，可否公開發表，使招商局加以注意改正。此上申報　錢朝珍謹啓。主址：徐家匯匯西街廿八弄一號。</p>

<h3>揚州續夢之二十三　揚州麵點</h3>
<p>— 為法洪</p>
<p>通都大邑的茶社酒樓常斷有「維揚細點」的招牌，足見揚州點心是可口的。其實除了點心而外，切麵也似別饒風味，因略談揚州麺點。</p>
<p>揚州切麺，蘇北人士有以為不如東台之細，東台之麵，堪稱銀絲細麵，可是揚州之煨麵，却亦非東台及他處所可及。煨麵之種類很多，大率隨時令而異，有刀魚煨麵，螃蟹愄麵，野鴨愄麵等等，此外更有一般的如蝦仁煨麵、鷄絲椳麵等等。這煨麵之妙，在於麺湯鮮美，麵條軟熟，而又不致湯與麫混糊不淸。在昔伊秉授曾任揚州知府，伊府麵即其所創，而煨麵據傳亦惜餘春主人高駝翁所創，伊高均是福建人，這煨麵之創製，看來似傾受伊府麵之影響。</p>
<p>至於點心方而，尤多精美者。書舫錄上論及揚州各茶社，以為「其點心各據一方之盛。雙虹樓燒餅，開風氣之先，有糖餡，肉餡，乾菜餾，萖菜餡之分，宜興丁四官開薰芳集芳，以糟　饅頭得名，二梅軒以灌湯包子得名，雨蓮以春餅得名，文杏園以稍麥得名，謂之鬼蓬頭，品陸　以淮餃得名，小方　以菜餃得名，各極其盛。」時移勞變，這許多「各據一方之盛」的茶社，現時都已不見。記得幼年尙在南門大街見有「品陸」，一爿小小的茶社，旣非舊址，亦不以淮餃得名，今則並此亦無。近年的揚州點心，則除了陳家燒餅外，筆者以為溺翠稍麥，千層油糕，蜂糖糕以及湯包均值得一提。</p>
<p>關於翡翠稍麥及千層油糕筆者曾於惜餘春續記中道及。而蜂糖糕則以一斤一小塊購自茶食由茶食店中轉買而來，多非自製。此糕以鬆軟，香甜，爽口勝。所謂「蜂糖」，當是代表「蜜」。由此可推證蜂油糖糕便是蜜糕，不過與江南各地之蜜糕却頗有不同，因而也別是一般滋味。他處仿製者，能鬆軟香甜已是不易，欲求爽口，便更難遇見。</p>
<p>再談湯包，即書舫錄中所稱灌湯包子，與鎭江或淮安所製都有不同之處。鎭江與淮安均以湯包著名，但鎮江所製，一年中僅有生肉及蟹黃兩種，而揚州則更有野鴨及荳苗等類。淮安所製，比之揚州，如以味論，似尙不及，祗是大愈兩倍，大得別致而巳</p>
<p>揚州麵點，其可口旣如上所述，是以揚人便樂於到茶社去淮早點，人謂揚人「早上皮包水」，這「皮包水」的習慣之養成，麺點之可口，實具有極大的誘惑力。即以筆者論，客居異地時，每當早餐，便常念及故鄉麵點，大類張翰之思尊羹鱸膾。不過揚州麵點雖好、而揚州茶社則已今非昔比。在昔茶客之進麵點，數量都很少，茶却飲得極多。他們以為吃茶不應與風雅分離過遠，如是進麵點至於杯盤狼藉，總不免顯露傖俗之氣。他們似乎共守一則信條，即是「君子淡嘗滋味」。而近時則來往茶社者，多不嫌麵點之多，如僅稍進麺點，堂倌固不乘靑，自家亦覺寒酸。於是阮囊羞澀之輩，或崇尙風雅之人，便不再常至茶社，即便回到故鄕，也還　和作客的張翰一樣，對於故鄉麵點，依舊列在懷念之中了！</p>
<h3>寒雲憶語</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>紫羅蘭食雜碎</p>
<p>去世以來，已十六周年了；八月三十一日是他的冥　，他的門弟子兪逸芬兄等，特在凈土奄　經追　，只因我　居吳巾，未得通知，不曾前去參加致祭，但覺愧對故人！記得民四年間寒兄為了反對他父親稱帝，曾做了一首詩規諫，以「分明」為題：「微棉强自勝，險晴向晚未分明，南回寒雁淹孤月，（兄會南遊一次）東去驕風　九城；（指日本父涉）駒隙留身爭一瞬，蛩聲催夢欲三更；絕憐高處多風雨，莫到樓最上層。」末二句就　隱說皇帝是做不得的。當時國會議員孫伯籣就根據了这首詩，宣言反對，說項城的次子克文，也不贊成帝制，何况他人；終於引起了蔡松坡將軍的雲南起義，打倒了洪憲。亡友畢倚虹兄，曾稅這一首詩，將來在歷史中定有位置的；而寒兄之薄皇子而不為，其人格之崇高，也可想而知了。民九民十年間，寒兄來滬作窩公，我正在聚精會神地編輯後期的「禮拜六」周刋，他就給了我一封信，備加稱許，說是願意和我做一個朋友，從此就訂了交，往來極密，凡是文酒之會，總得邀我列席，凡是他所收藏的骨董文玩以及古泉郵票之類，也一一同我摩挲觀賞，後來他又愛好了西方的古金幣，廣事搜羅，每有所得，總以金幣上的西字和我研討，這麼三二年，彼此早就交深莫逆了。後來我又編行了「半月」「紫羅蘭」「紫籣花片」諸刋物，寒兄又盡力相助，所用對面題簽，都由他一手包「三十年聞見行　」諸名作，以及其他詩詞小品，不勝枚舉；他專為我作的詩也有不少，茲錄其一二，如題紫蘭花片云：「還能明珠涕淚埀，紫籣香去未移時；吳淞一剪眉痕在，苦憶蒼波照鬢絲。」「無限情波暗暗通，紫蘭花片尺角中；閒愁寫入新詞調，和淚研木一例紅。」題紫羅閉神造象云：「神女無端幻紫蘭，雲軿星佩落江千；空敎自石流仙景，十　紅樓夢已寒。」「當年有願作鴛鴦，彈指仙凡恨竟長；洛水巫山都隱約，微彼遙夢已神傷。」紫羅蘭神贊云:「比花長好，比月當圓，香柔夢永，別有情天。右把明珠，左揮涕淚，願花之神，持歡母墜。」魚魚雅雅，具見他詞章上的工力。後來他回到了津沽，還是常通尺素，並以江南好一　見懷云:「鵑聲苦，憔悴更誰同？早託寓言傳本事，今從小記識遊蹤。（按時予方遊莫干山，有「山中瑣記」之作，刋上海書報。）夢老紫籣叢。」附有一函，說在滬時意氣相投，如手如足，願訂為異姓兄弟，請子贊同云云，我感愧之餘，立時去書答允了。民二十一年間，寒兄戒絕嗜好，嘯傲京津問，不幸害了羊毛疹，不治去世，我得了噩耗，一慟幾絕，只因紊於人事，未能前去一弔，只索北望燕雲，臨風暘斷而已。如今他與世長辭已十六年了，遺著除了日記外，大都散佚，眞是一件憾事！所幸他的公子仲燕叔選，遊學新大陸，都已有了成就，可為國用；寒兄一靈不味，也該含笑於九泉吧。</p>
<h3>晨曦三章</h3>
<p>— 曹國平</p>
<p>喇叭花</p>
<p>的確，在這荒蕪的園圃中，祇有在破曉前怒放的喇叭花，方可以自驕的了。</p>
<p>我看到它們像是趾高氣揚地微笑着，它們矝誇着自己的顏容，而蔑視着鄰近枯憔凋謝了的花草。它們似乎感謝這璣境給了它們更豐盛的命運。</p>
<p>幾枝是開着純白的花朶，幾枝是紫白相間的。沒有人會濾灌它們，但也沒有野孩子會來折傷它們的枝葉。寗靜地，快樂地生活着……。</p>
<p>一天，我挨近它們的身旁，曲着背俯視它們，我忽然發覺這些花朶都是垂頭喪氣地伏在地土上嘆息。我看到以往曾一直滋養了它們生命的露珠，却變成它們從心坎底裏湧流最辛酸的淚珠。這熱淚是它們生命結局的預兆，也是為自己的死亡而悲悼……。</p>
<p>我似乎隱隱地聽到它們的訴際；——「常我們一見到太陽光，我們的身體便會枯竭萎衰，生命的活力立刻會消失……。」</p>
<p>我將永會為這些祇能在沒有光明存在的地方活着生命——過着自滿和快樂的生活。——的花朶惋惜着。……因為誰能說天空裏不會再有太陽？大地不會再有亮光？</p>
<p>海鷗</p>
<p>睡醒了，這沙灘上的海鷗，它潔白得像聖女的禮服一樣的身。撲了撲蜷縮一夜的翅膀，開始飛翔在天際。</p>
<p>四周是寂靜，捕魚的船見還沒有揭去蓬幃，似乎很安舒地在讓波浪舐着它的身體。</p>
<p>海鷗自由地在翱翔着，忽兒乘了風兒平穩地前進，俄而又翻轉了翅翼抗對着風震衝勝着……</p>
<p>鷗兒輕捷地掠下，急吻着海面，報吿着黎明的消息。於是茫茫的大海，抖擻了一下平靜的身子，便張大了喉嚨來歌羞洪濤巨浪之聲，禶頌着光明的降臨…。激動了安寗的水面，頓時成為海原上的高岡和低丘。它帶起了生命的活力，又滾滾地携着它的責任邁進。</p>
<p>海鷗忙碌地但欣慰地在每一隻漁船頂上，它高唱着淸晨之歌。頃刻之間，岸灘邊息夜的船隻，掛起了旅蓬；舟子掉善漿櫓，發出款乃之昔。這些船上的人懷着莫大的希望，帶着全副的力量，開始着一天的工作。</p>
<p>砰　的浪濤聲，咿啞櫓擊聲，嘹喨的歌聲，交織了一支歡迎曲。但願希望的生命永遠在歌聲中隨着快樂的日子進行吧！</p>
<p>東方海天相接的邊際處，現出了一條紅霞。</p>
<p>旭日</p>
<p>好容易，漲紅了肥胖臉孔的旭日，從紅霞的懷抱中掙出了身來。整個的宇宙光明了，溫暖了</p>
<p>枝頭小烏唱出的甜蜜曲，水裹游魚發出的潑刺聲，人類心坎中的靈歌，都不是為了受到它的溫和和光明後的禮讚嗎；</p>
<p>旭日啊，我該感謝你，沒有一天你願意停止到宇宙上來。你自東　西，所經過的田野，鄕村予了生命的泉源——光和熱——一，花園中的富翁有你的暖和，同樣地在馬路東了一夜的乞丐，也能享受到你的恩惠。你不曾偏待</p>
<p>旭日啊，我頌讚你。你究善的愛普及萬方，你純粹的愛播種在你自己的田園裹。你生命的血液親自灌輸進我們貧血人的體丙，你是生命的樹幹，你備藏了豐富的滋養，供給我們這些屬於你的枝條。</p>
<p>旭日阿，我將吿慰你。我們的枝子，不是徒然消耗你賜予的生命大。我們會開出鮮麗的花朶，會　出肥碩的甜果。我們枝子裹的營養料料——是你所供給——也絕不會讓蚜蟲和毛蟲來吞吸掉……。我們會竭力保特這不可失去的活力。</p>
<p>旭日啊，千萬人民眞誠的讚美和感恩，是你所應得的，請你變受了吧！</p>
<h3>伍蠡甫畫展東坡句奉贈</h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>溪山愈好意無厭，目盡孤鴻落照邊。猶有夢回淸興在，偶題詩句不須編。</p>
<p>身行萬里半天下，腹有詩書氣自華。紙落雲烟供醉後，北窗驚我眼飛花。</p>
<p>便覺峨眉翠掃空，眞形猶在畫圖中，直將眼力為疆界，數到雲峯第幾重。</p>
<p>大千起滅一塵裏，信手得俱成。不解丹靑追世好，與子相逢亦弟兄。</p>
<p>握手一笑三千年，交舊何人慰眼前？大隱本來無境界，已敎呼取散花仙。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>本來這一類的東西，天生就是一副詭詐肚腸，再加訓練起來，頭一門主要功課，又是實用心理學，擅長窺伺人意。首先給你許多「甜頭」，同時探明你的目標，再給你一個大希望，吊住你的胃口，你明知它不好對付，在將計就計的條件下，却又認為可以利用，不甘心丟手。繼羣現在碰對的，大概就是這麼一個東西—您認為她應該怎樣對付？</p>
<p>「您貴姓什麼，麥？：」　羣等它住了口，便也劃破了自己的沉靜。「嗐，眞對不起，剛才您走得那麼匆忙，我也沒有聽得眞，可是貴姓麥，—大麥的麥？」　羣像驚鴻一般，着手浮光掠影式的突擊。</p>
<p>「不，」它眉花眼笑地，表示耀羣一開口，就是它的無上光宋似的：「買—買賣的買。」</p>
<p>「貿賣的買？」耀羣流動着眼珠，大約在默默地背誦「趙錢孫李」，看看有沒有這們一個冷門姓。</p>
<p>「您沒知道，」它早明白了耀羣的心意，「這不是中國姓。」</p>
<p>「那麼：」耀羣想說「那麼定是一個外國姓？」</p>
<p>「可又不是外國姓，」它又裂開了兩　厚嘴唇，「造裹面有一幕悲劇。」說到悲劇二字，它輕輕嘆了一口氣，好像挑起了無限感觸似的：「先母受孕的時候，原有兩位丈夫，于位姓買可托羅夫司基，一位姓馬可沙夫。先母為了紀念他們二位，所以等鄙人一下地，就把這兩個姓一起給了　人，算是兩家法定遺產承繼人。但因鄙人在哈爾　進的中國學校，老師裕那姓名太累贅，所以當中截去一大段，只留了一頭一尾，作為姓名。」</p>
<p>「進的中國學校？」解羣注意這一點。</p>
<p>「因為先母大槪不是蒙古籍就是「滿洲」籍，特別喜歡中國語言。這才進的中國學校。您知道，咱母女倆除了俄國話，還能說四五種方言，運日木語在內。……可是鄙人除了語言之外，最喜歡音樂，所以後來專念音樂……」它又自我宣傳了。</p>
<p>「聲樂？還是……」耀羣借話打話，研究它的細底。</p>
<p>「唉，　　人　老母熟嗓子，　兒能學鞏。」又伸出了一雙手，「　這雙釘耙，所以樂器也談不到；只好學樂理和作曲……除了音樂，鄙人還醉心美術，雖說不能動手，倒是能够品評，也能考據……此外，蒙古玩意兒，射，驕，摔，打，也能對付，可是門　　罷了。」</p>
<h3>黃山始信峯（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 方君璧</p>
<p>自由談　人物誌</p>
<h3>關於川島芳子</h3>
<p>— 夏谿</p>
<p>誰都知道，川島芳子是中日戰爭史上的「尤物」，她利用着色相和手腕，從事間諜工作，參與過每一次日本侵筆的陰謀。她曾度過各種離奇的生活，做過王妃和總司令，也做過舞孃和妓女，而目前，她正在經歷另一種環境—獄生涯。這在她也許並不有趣，但在千千萬萬受過苦難的中國人民心頭，該是够痛快的。可不見前天報上的紀載麼？北平公審川島芳子，就險把法庭都擠壞了。自然，這些觀審者的心情，除了復仇性的痛快以外，多少還帶着好奇的成份的，還好奇心正由於川島芳子複雜離奇的生平</p>
<p>提起這位「遠東瑪　哈麗」，可也說來話長。大家知道她是肅親王的第七個女兒，原是道地的中國貨。肅親王為了復辟不成，在旅順自殺以後，日本浪人用平次朗收養了她做養女。據用鳥芳子的自白書上說：「余之義父，乃日本名聞遐邇之「中國通」，余賴此關係得以結識若干日人，並於彼等獲得「中日親善」之意義，余嘗以彼等之理想相溶合而奉為座右銘，甚而寗願為比目的而獻身。」</p>
<p>事實上，她第一次「獻身」的對象却正是她的義父，後來鬧了些瓜葛，父女關係就此斷絕。芳子過着淫佚的生活，直到黑龍會發掘了她，她才由一個放蕩的交際花，變成了今日的時務漢奸的身份。</p>
<p>川島芳子第一次做黑體會的工具被獻給了內蒙昭烏達盟巴林郡王做妃子。日本人想利用了這重關係，把覬覦已久的內蒙佔為己有，但是芳子過不慣沙漠生涯，偷偷地溜回日本，使這「美人計」終於功虧一簣。</p>
<p>隨後，芳子被派到到東北，與關東軍發生了關係，在土肥原的訓練下，她成了一個幹練的女間諜。她時常喬裝女敎員或旅行家，在東北刺探軍情，有時扮了中國或朝鮮妓女，在賭窟和嗎啡館裹鬼混，她帮助土肥原策劃瀋陽事變，把　儀搬上了皇位。四百個女間諜曾經歸她指揮。她又曾經喬　過一個中國學生，奉派到海參崴，和蘇聯官塲結交，刺探只加爾湖以東的軍事秘密，還因此得到過日本政府的獎章。</p>
<p>「一二八」戰事時，川鳥在上海下海伴舞，誘惑我國軍政要員。敵軍根據了如的情報侵入上海。熱河戰事舉發後，她竟又組繼起什麽義勇軍來，以金璧輝總司令的姿態出現。</p>
<p>她從小就喬裝男子在中學裹吟　，在華北，他喜歡穿了袍子為褂，足御緞靴，戴頂瓜皮帽，打得一口好官腔，完全軍閥氣派，出入衛隊侍從，威風八面。</p>
<p>有時，這位金司令變做王將軍，有時變做了舞女萬仙白。「八「三」以後，又變成了中國士兵，在北火車站活動過。隨後，又變成了李松祥，在香港和注逆精衛的內弟陳逆耀祖厮混在一起。最後又囘到北平。</p>
<p>她的情人，可謂包羅萬象：有軍閥，有日本浪人，有理髮館的老闆，有打拳的拳師，有名伶，也有新聞記者。武生李萬春就</p>
<p>川烏芳子的年紀，至今還是一個謎：據她在法庭上供稱為三十五歲，據北平記事報紀載，為四十歲，據申報記者的訪問為三十八歲，如據內三區戶籍，差得更遠了，戶籍上是：「川島芳子，金　輝，四十四歲，籍貫滿洲，職業滿洲國民團總司令」。這是民國二十七年調查的，那麼計算今年應該是五十三歲了。</p>
<p>據說她在北平的寓所，防範森嚴，如　養二十九條軍犬及許多猴子，還有二隻白鷄，受過特殊訓練替她看門，但是沒有用，勝利後的第一個變十節，終於在北平被捕。法庭裏，她還是那樣「聲東擊西」，一味狡辯，但是間諜的手腕在法官前究竟沒有大用處的嘔！我們等待着十月二十二日，那便是實判川島芳子一生罪行的日子！</p>
<h3>第三國際</h3>
<p>— 破輪</p>
<p>最近蘇聯已宣佈成立新共產國際，這件新聞是足够動人的。關於第三國際的復活。我們回頭來看它一段簡史。</p>
<p>共產國際，又名第三國際，亦稱做在雜什維古國際，因為它是以蘇聯共產黨為核心。所謂第三國際言經過三次的演變；第一國際的壽命祇不過八年；而第二國際亦僅活了二十五年。第一二國際都是列寗領導的。產生第三次國際仍是列寗領導，但經過幾次波折而至難產；到了蘇聯革命成功之後，乃於一九一九年三月二日至四日在莫斯科成立。參加代表計有三十四國，漸而增加至六十五個國家</p>
<p>從第三國際的產生以至解散，大體上可分為五個時期：第一時期自成立起到一九二三年止，還個時期正是蘇聯共產黨從事奪取政　的　期，四年的內戰雖然使共產黨獲得戰國政權，但急進的戰鬥工產主義還沒有找到一條出路，於是在蘇聯國內，乃採取新經濟政策。第二時期自一九二四年至一九二七年，史達林和托洛斯基的政洽鬥爭非常劇烈，他們兩個人固然都主張世界英命，而史氏所主張的慢進，托氏主張急進；結果托氏失敗。第三時期是一九二七年至一九三五年，蘇聯埋頭於國內的經濟建設，所謂世界革命便一時停頓起來。因為參加共產國際各國事實上等於莫斯科的附庸，他們亦各自訂立黨綱了，第四時期一九三五至一九三八年，時納粹和法西斯勢力極為鞏固，共產國際乃採用人民陣線政策以對抗之，但沒有成績。第五時期開始於一九三九年二次世界大戰之初，因為蘇聯和德國的訂約，使共產黨的國際性漸趨萎縮。到了德國進攻蘇聯而站在同眼國這絛線上之後，始於一九四三年五月廿二日正式解散第三國際組織。</p>
<p>但同盟國擊垮了軸心國家後兩年中，美蘇的對立越來越顯明，整個世界劃分為二的鴻溝越來越深，新共產國際的成立已拖住地球更逼近戰爭的邊緣了！</p>
<h3>羅斯福二三事</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>在雅爾達會議的最後一天，大家都有空餘的時問來交際和休息，一個英國的隨員和羅斯福閒談，問他：「總統先生，你今年幾歲？」</p>
<p>羅斯福回答說:「照日曆上看來，我今年六十二歲，但當我有工作要做時，我是三十五歲。」</p>
<p>一個白宮的訪問者問：「總統先生，你怎樣會得到這麼多的耐性的—一天中碰到許多的麻煩事情和不速之客？」</p>
<p>羅斯福淡然地回答：「當你化了二年的時間去學習怎樣搖動你的大脚指頭以後，你就有耐性了。」</p>
<h3>孫瑜黎莉莉的談話　—記「中製」的歡迎茶會</h3>
<p>— 公望</p>
<p>在金司徒廟「中製」的攝影場裹，舉行了一個雖不盛大而頗</p>
<p>孫瑜先生提出了一個「合作」的問題，他說：「……在美國的攝製電影相當複雜，並且是分工制，這一件很小的事情，都有專門負責的人管理，假如其中有一小部份工作選純或躭誤，即會影響整個工作……。」他又說：「……除掉美國的科學和技術方面的設備比我們優良之外，他們的藝術水準和工作的刻苦精神，並不一定比我們强。……」孫先生的前一問題使我國產常影工作者應該警惕自己，而後一些話也給予我們莫大的慰安與鼓勵。</p>
<p>在物質條件粗劣，膠片，器材貧乏的今天，假使我們電影工作者，還是為着個人的自私，那末只有讓這已經苦苦經當二十餘年的事業，付之東流。</p>
<p>黎莉莉莉小姐比在軍慶時苗條多了，她說那是在美國不吃牛油半奶戰瘦的，因為在美國一個女孩子胖了會被人感到是「愚蠢」，美國正是個愛美的國家，尤其是女孩子們，也許是牛油麵包大　富的關係。</p>
<p>黎小姐說：美國不管怎麼，只要某部片十賣座，或是某個戲最出風頭，那麼，那部片子或戲的導演和演員使是最紅最佳的導演和演員。我相信我們絕不會同意這一種制度。</p>
<p>黎小姐談了很多在美時的學習情形，和孫瑜先生共同所發生的笑話。但我得提出一件值得令人注意的事：那就是美國人不太暸解中國，往往將一些事情曲解了，例如：認為廣州很久以前所出的粵語片是代表着中國的電影界，而更有人認為中國有彎影是件驚奇的事。</p>
<p>還有一次美國一家公司，請黎小姐主演一片工作六星期，是兩萬六千美金的酬勞。劇本題材是描寫一中國女郞在一交易所中如何騙取外國人的錢，並殺害了一個外國人而逃跑，黎小姐以含有侮辱中國人的地方，斷然地予以拒絕。這是頗可贊美的。</p>
<p>黎小姐還提出了爭取外國電影市場，來換取外匯，這是個很值得研討的問題。但我覺得在今天似乎先應　固自己，安定自己，而後再去爭取外國市塲。我們今天念需的是大家熟誠的合作，來堅定我們的力量，以鞏固事業　基礎。</p>
<h3>下次世界大戰</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>在第二次世界的過程中，人類也重復地感覺世界和平的可貴，領導同盟國家作戰的美國故總統羅斯福，便提出四大自由和聯合國的偉大口號及計劃，給尙在浸身於戰爭之中的人類，繪出一幅美麗的戰後世界的和平遠景。然而，也正在第二次世界大戰米結東的中途，更有不少敏感的人類却在討論第三次世界戰爭的事情。如美國前駐蘇法大使威廉澝立德在其所著Tne　Great　Globe　Isezf的序文中所云：</p>
<p>「一九四四年八月問，美法聯軍進攻南部法蘭西的前夕，各將領聚集於彼陶亞特將軍的餐廳裹，他們所談的並非目前所從事的戰爭，乃是下一次的世界大戰。他們都知道當時各强國皆在研究如何利用原子能從事戰爭的問題，因此遂預想到米來的戰爭當為滿裝原子彈的火箭與噴射式的飛機在交綏。」</p>
<p>於是「彼陶亞時將軍曾以妙喻結束此次談話，他說：「你要間下一次世界大戰的結果麼？我以為人類的種族都將在這次戰爭中被原十彈毀減殆盡，最後僅是剩下兩架飛機和兩個航空員，他們復又彼此環總着地球迫逐。及其飛抵菲洲的上空，油能突然吿啟，遂致先後墜落，隕滅於叢林之中。其時人　蹲於樹際的老猩猩，睹此情景，乃頻　肩膀與牠的配偶說道：偌，他們全完了，我與你又要重新開始了。」</p>
<p>這雖然滿蓄着幽默的諷刺，可見不一年第一顆原子彈果然光臨日本廣島，第二顆繼臨畏崎，促成日本的投降，縮短第二次大戰的結束。原子彈的威力也恰如彼陶亞特和其他的將軍們所想像的一樣，如果無限制地使用起來，人類　的會整個毀減的。無如現實太冷酷而無情，戰後世界的局勢又變成戰前的「翻版」；「原子彈」也成為世界人類　上的陰影，人們可在熱烈地討論第三次世界大戰將在何時發生了。</p>

<h3>Report on Wedemeyer's Visit to China: Marshall to Issue Statement Reaffirming Support for China's Democratic Development</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Although President Truman announced on the 16th that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement in the next few days regarding Envoy Wedemeyer's report on his visit to China, observers here generally believe that if Marshall were to disclose any information from this closely guarded secret document, it would not reveal too much of its content. Speculation regarding the content of Envoy Wedemeyer's report, especially the increasing speculation about aid to China proposed in the report, and the growing criticism caused by the delayed release of the report's findings, have compelled U.S. officials to respond to the matter. At a press conference on the morning of the 16th, when a reporter asked if the President would make General Wedemeyer's report public, President Truman seemed to have a plan in mind. He immediately replied that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement on the matter in the next few days, indicating that he had recently discussed the matter with Marshall. Senior White House and State Department officials are aware of the intense public interest in Envoy Wedemeyer's report, and the rumors surrounding it have apparently compelled Marshall to at least temporarily clarify the current situation. Marshall is currently in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly, so it is not yet known whether the statement will be issued in New York or by the State Department here. It is generally believed that Marshall's statement will not contain any surprises, and is expected to be a general and vague statement reaffirming America's deep concern for China's fate and Washington's determination to find a satisfactory and feasible way to support and assist the Chinese government in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation. Marshall's statement will be an interim response to some comments on his attitude toward Wedemeyer's report.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] General Wedemeyer strongly urged the United States to aid the Chinese people, issuing a warning: "Unless the Chinese government initiates rigorous reforms, China will be drawn into the Soviet sphere of influence, and American aid will be of no avail." Wedemeyer declared: "The majority of the Chinese people do not wish to become communists, but they will accept any form of government that provides them with food and clothing." Wedemeyer expressed this view in a letter to Mrs. Coolidge, vice-chairman of the United China Relief Association's Women's Group, and agreed to its public release.</p>
<p>In his letter, Wedemeyer emphasized that if the United States were to provide any assistance, it must only reach "good Chinese people" and not be used to embolden those who "harm the principles of the United Nations Charter." (Continued on the left corner of the second page)</p>
<h3>U.S. Relief Supplies to Aid China: Draft Agreement is Highly Detailed; U.S. Troops Remain in China with Chinese Consent</h3>

The draft Sino-American agreement was negotiated by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with relevant agencies and representatives of the U.S. government. Its content includes ten articles and is highly detailed. A brief summary follows: (Continues on the first column of the second page)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the stationing of U.S. armed forces in China, a formal exchange of notes between China and the United States has stated that it is with the consent of the Chinese government. A report was submitted to the State Council on the 17th. According to a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1946, it was recommended that member states withdraw any armed forces stationed in the territory of other member states without the consent of the host country. Therefore, our government has issued a formal statement clarifying that the U.S. troops in China are stationed with the consent of our government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also replied to the U.S. side, stating that if both governments believe that these U.S. troops should be withdrawn, they shall be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Anti-Smuggling Agreement: China and Hong Kong Still in Negotiations</h3>

<h3>World YWCA Passes Important Resolutions: Recognizes Korea as an Independent Member</h3>

<h3>Overseas Assets of Chinese Nationals</h3>
<p>Regulations on Declaration Referred Back for Review</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The issue of utilizing overseas deposits of Chinese nationals was submitted to the State Council for discussion on the 17th. As some issues still need to be discussed, it was decided to refer it back for review. It is understood that some government officials believe that these regulations are impractical and contrary to international law, making them difficult to implement. The main purpose of the regulations is to encourage voluntary declaration. If they do not declare, they will be sentenced to five years of imprisonment. However, foreign banks do not publicly disclose the names of depositors, and if they do not declare themselves, it will be impossible to imprison them. Therefore, the regulations are merely a formality. Most committee members believe that it is necessary to review them again, and it was decided to refer the original proposal to the Economic Review Committee of the Council for review. At the same time, it was suggested that the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs draft a statement to inform the public of the progress of the negotiations with various countries concerned regarding this matter over the past two years. The English statement will be announced shortly.</p>

<h3>Japan Seeks to Join the United Nations: Government in Nanjing Rejects Sternly; Wang Chonghui Says Japan Aims to Sneak into Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama expressed his views on the Japanese peace conference in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 16th, hoping to join the United Nations, which has drawn attention here. When asked by our newspaper reporter on the afternoon of the 17th, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Katayama's so-called hope to join the United Nations as soon as possible and to send a delegation to the Japanese peace conference is just a hope and, at most, just a propaganda ploy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not intend to say much at this time. In fact, Japan is still a defeated country under Allied control, and its future will be determined by the Allies. It is difficult to say whether it can speak at the peace conference and whether it will enjoy more favorable treatment than Italy. At the end of the war, Italy had fought alongside the Allies against Germany, but Japan did not. Former Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying criticized Katayama's remarks, saying that Japan cannot have any hope before the signing of the peace treaty, and can only hope to have a speaking opportunity after the signing of the treaty. Wang Chonghui said that Japan's surrender was unconditional, and Japan must accept any conditions proposed by the Allies.</p>

Transportation to Qianyang, Lingzhou, and other places, as well as industrial and civilian coal use, all depend on this, so it is highly valued by all sectors.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Adjusting Prices for Public Utilities</h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai's public utilities are brewing price adjustments. According to news from the Public Utilities Bureau, the public utilities requesting price adjustments this time include electricity, gas, telephone, public buses, ferries, and small trains. Except for tap water, which will remain unchanged for the time being, it can be said that there will be a comprehensive adjustment. The last time public utilities adjusted prices was on July 1st. Because the adjustment standards were fair, the impact on prices after the adjustment was not too great. Although citizens felt that the burden had increased, they could forgive the difficulties of public utilities. It is said that the adjustments currently being brewed could increase prices by more than double, with the highest reaching 2.2 times. In particular, the "automatic adjustment" requested by the electricity company, the proposed price increase standard is even more alarming, and the government authorities have not yet approved it. This is a matter of unanimous attention to Shanghai's public and private institutions and the four or five million citizens today.</p>
<p>Public utilities are enterprises that serve the social population and have an impact on the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of people in urban society. They cannot be equated with ordinary commercial goods. Moreover, public utilities are closely related to general economic construction and social stability, and must be given serious consideration. For example, postal, telecommunications, and railways are operated by the state for the purpose of facilitating the people and preventing monopolies. The more widely postal, telecommunications, and railways are used, the more opportunities people have for knowledge exchange and information dissemination, and the greater the opportunities for market regulation and mutual exchange, the convenience of which is not limited to those who use postal, telecommunications, and railways themselves. Electricity, that is, the electrical industry, is an enterprise that supplies electric lights, electric heating, and electric power. It is not only needed for family life but also the driving force of industrial and mining production. Gas, telephone, trams, and automobiles are all power needed by the people, and their purpose of use is the same as postal, telecommunications, and railways, and they are especially closely related to small and medium-sized citizens. There are many types of public utilities, which develop with urban civilization. The establishment and management of public utilities, whether state-owned or private, government-run or business-run, inherently has a service spirit, and the government grants special patents, so it should not be purely for profit. This should be no doubt.</p>
<p>Because public utilities are for the purpose of service and are closely related to the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of the people's lives, the government must regulate them. Regulation is neither a monopoly nor obstruction, its purpose is to prevent free price increases by controlling prices. There was a time when the government implemented a subsidy policy for public utilities, which considerably delayed the general price increase, but later abandoned the subsidies and only used passive methods to control, which was tantamount to allowing them to raise prices freely. Thus, as the water rises, so does the boat, and general merchants inevitably follow suit by raising prices to "keep up" with public utilities. This time, various public utility companies, citing reasons such as the growth of foreign codes, rising fuel prices, and rational fields, decided to automatically adjust prices, requesting very high standards, and the adjustment method also seems to be not properly adjusted. The municipal government has no opinion on this and only forwarded it to the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for deliberation; and the Municipal Council, which represents public opinion, has not had a detailed discussion on raising the prices of public utilities after passing a bill on conserving electricity and levying high fines. In today's difficult situation, approving price increases for public utilities would impose too heavy a burden on the people; not approving price increases would make public utilities feel strained. Therefore, the government's handling is very cautious, and the result is still inevitable to allow, but only the issue of which standard to adopt and what limits to set for the price increase. And what ordinary citizens are concerned about is the issue of this price increase limit!</p>
<p>As we see it, the subsidy method is indeed not very appropriate because the national treasury cannot bear the burden, but allowing free price increases would also have too great an impact on the people's burden. Urban public utilities should, in principle, be borne by the citizens, but today the citizens' direct burden is too heavy and is worth considering. Please do not forget by the municipal government: What is the use of the 10% municipal construction donation attached to the public utility charges? Can it be used to subsidize some public services? On the government side, unnecessary administrative expenses and waste can be eliminated; and for the items most closely related to small and medium-sized citizens, it is necessary to review and subsidize the income. In terms of various public utilities, we must recognize the difficulties of the times and try to save as much as possible in management, avoid wasteful angles, and price increases must have standards and proportions. Otherwise, various goods will stimulate each other, leap cyclically, the burden on citizens will be difficult, and public service will lose its spirit of service, which is also not a good thing!</p>
<h3>The Unfolding Economy Movement</h3>
<p>The conservation movement has gradually materialized from theory, and all parties are promoting it separately. In this city, except for the implementation measures for the ban on dancing, which are still being requested from the central government, the rest, such as the conservation of paper, the restriction of banquets, and the punctuality movement, have been officially implemented one after another. Although there are no fundamental differences in the attitude of all parties to this matter, their views are not entirely the same. Some focus on the point of rectifying social discipline, believing that the world is too extravagant and too lewd and should be corrected in time; others focus on the military aspect, believing that during this period of general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, one should not be too indulgent in enjoyment. The motivation for implementing conservation this time comes from the general mobilization outline. The government's intention may also be glimpsed from this. However, in our opinion, the main factor of this movement is not so much social or military as it is economic.</p>
<p>Recently, the price increase has been rampant and endless, making people panic and at a loss. Although there are many reasons for this, the key lies in the shortage of materials. Because if there is no problem with supply, people will not panic, speculation will not be rampant, and black markets will not appear. Even if there is inflation and the value of the currency falls, it will not cause the price increase to form a crazy state. According to statistical reports, the multiple of the current price index far exceeds the multiple of the issuance of legal currency, which shows that the reason for the soaring prices is partly due to the fall in the value of the currency, but the other part lies in the lack of materials.</p>
<p>Why are materials so scarce? Simply put, it is nothing more than that production is depressed, transportation is not smooth, and imports are severely restricted. It is feared that these kinds of problems cannot be solved smoothly in the short term. From the point of view of the third point, requesting an increase in the export of goods in order to increase the amount of foreign exchange holdings, which means that we must first seek an increase in export goods. Therefore, countries such as England and Japan are tightening their belts and implementing their "starvation export" policies. Because without exports, imports cannot be obtained, and without imports, their biological products cannot be enriched. Therefore, the role of the conservation movement is not only destructive, but also truly active.</p>
<p>Currently, all countries are working hard to promote this movement, regardless of whether they can borrow dollars, whether there is war in the country, or whether their own materials are scarce, just because of the passive saving and frugality, hoping to alleviate the severe situation of their lack, and also with a kind of active role. The above-mentioned increase in exports and exchange imports is only one of these roles. Others, such as suppressing price increases, reducing inflation, balancing the national budget, stabilizing people's lives, and revitalizing the economy and aiding other countries, fundamentally cannot but start with restricting consumption. Therefore, simply regarding the conservation movement as a means of reducing government spending and rectifying social customs underestimates the value of "conservation."</p>
<p>No one is concerned about the current economic chaos, and no one does not want to come up with practical solutions to overcome the difficulties. Such as increasing production and stabilizing the value of the currency, these are indeed important plans to save the situation; however, when implemented, requesting speed and universality, which can be done immediately, and everyone can devote themselves to, is nothing more than the path of conservation. Everyone should be careful not to underestimate it, thinking that it is just an old saying and not worth paying attention to, and also be careful not to be too indulgent to themselves, thinking that the enjoyment of one person and one family has nothing to do with the overall national situation. It should be known that the various economic emergency measures announced by countries such as England, France, and Japan, although grand and detailed, with outlines and objectives, are all about asking everyone to save practically first and to survive the difficulties.</p>
<p>Some people think that people's livelihood is so difficult that many people are already on the brink of starvation, and there is really nothing to conserve. This is indeed the case. However, current life is very different, and enjoyment is too unequal. As the ancient poem says: "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." In the class of vermilion gates, they should abandon extravagance and advocate simplicity, strive for conservation, and retain a bit of vitality for the country, which is to alleviate the resentment of those who are on the verge of starvation!</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotion of conservation should not be biased towards the people; all the words such as setting an example in person and being a model for the people have already been mentioned by others and need not be repeated. However, programs such as streamlining redundant agencies, eliminating redundant personnel, and reducing unnecessary expenditures, although the authorities have repeatedly discussed and decided to implement them, often use various reasons to put the resolutions on the shelf in the guest room, and fail to fully meet the ideals of the general public. On the contrary, some special civil servants are extremely extravagant and wasteful, spending tens of millions of dollars a month, all paid by the public. This matter has been seen in official documents and is not entirely fictitious. Therefore, we have two very important suggestions for the economy movement: It must be promoted by officials and the people together, especially the wealthy officials and magnates who enjoy too much, should take the spirit of self-denial and set an example first. All implementation measures should still be based on facts and carefully drafted, especially do not set the theory too high, so as to avoid obstacles to implementation and still become a typical official article.</p>

<h3>Our Proposal to the ARO Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The secretary of the delegation told reporters: "The conference is scheduled to begin on the 27th of this month and end on November 8th. It is stipulated that after the opening of the conference several times, four committees will be established to study various issues and proposals separately, and then submit reports to the conference for discussion. The subjects of the four committees' research are divided into: Social security, labor policy, implementation of the standards stipulated in the International Labor Convention in the Asian region, and the socio-economic background of Asia, including industrialization issues. After our delegation arrives in India, it will first hold an internal meeting. Proposals from both labor and management and government representatives will be submitted, discussed first, and if there are similar natures, they will be merged first before being proposed to the conference. After the meeting is over, except for one government representative who is scheduled to go to various parts of Southeast Asia to inspect overseas Chinese affairs, the remaining fourteen people will immediately return to the country." Furthermore, the important cases that our delegation is preparing to submit to the conference are as follows: Please ask the International Labor Office to organize an investigation team to collect information on Asian workers in preparation for the International Labor Organization's expansion to Asia. Please ask the conference to determine the Asian labor inspection standards. Please formulate and promote standards for employee welfare undertakings. Universally implement the protection of tenant farmers, stabilize rural areas, and reduce the reserve army of labor to stabilize the lives of workers in service. To protect the employment opportunities of Asian workers, industrialized countries should assist underdeveloped countries in implementing industrialization plans, and the latter can also adopt protective tariff policies to maintain the minimum living standards of workers. Limit Japan's industrial level to between 1912 and 1916, so that its living standards will not be higher than the average level of Asian countries, and it will not become an aggressive country again.</p>
<h3>The Stalemate of Political Parties Nominating Candidates Has Not Yet Been Broken</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The issue of the allocation of nominated candidate quotas for the three parties has almost become a stalemate as of the evening of the 17th. Xu Chuanlin, the State Council member of the Democratic Socialist Government, has scheduled a banquet for Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, and Hong Lanyou at 7 pm on the 18th, which may bring about a turnaround. However, according to people from the Democratic Socialist Party, the party's State Council members and political committee members have ceased to participate in the State Council and political affairs meetings held by the government in the past week.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The issue of the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the provincial, municipal, and county councils in principle was approved by the 12th meeting of the State Council on September 26, and it was decided to hand it over to the Legislative Yuan to amend the organizational laws and regulations of the provincial, county, and city councils. The Legislative Yuan, upon receiving the order, held a symposium on the 17th. During the talks, the Legislative Yuan members of the Democratic and Youth Parties hoped that this case could be passed based on the following reasons: Candidates for supervisors must be nominated by more than five councilors, and there are currently no members of each party in the councils of various places, and members of each party cannot participate in the election of supervisors. According to Article 12 of the Basic Principles of Governance, the councils of each province, city, and county should be jointly participated in by all parties and non-party members as much as possible. Those who adopt the selection method in the institutions of public opinion have precedents such as the Political Participation Council and the National Assembly. Opponents claim that although the principles of governance stipulate the inclusion of all parties, the method is not necessarily limited to selection, etc. The meeting did not reach a conclusion, and the original case will be handed over to the Legislative Affairs Committee and the Autonomous Law Committee for review, and then submitted to the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Unscrupulous Merchants Were Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 17th] In view of the recent rampant price increases in this city, which obviously have unscrupulous merchants speculating and manipulating, the local price supervision group, in order to effectively curb it, dispatched personnel from military, constitutional, political, police, and other agencies at 10 am this morning, and after gathering at the county party headquarters, immediately went to the three markets of oil, flour, and miscellaneous grains, and seized 116 people, including illegal outsiders and speculative unscrupulous merchants such as Meng Xianpu, who had no documents, and escorted them to the Wuxi Command for strict handling.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Wuxi Command believes that there are a considerable number of food ships blocking the inland rivers, all of which are speculative merchants trying to avoid taxes and save expenses, and waiting for speculation. This has led to the phenomenon of soaring grain prices when new rice enters the market. At this time of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it is urgent to control them. The county government is ordered to strictly register the grain ships arriving at the port, and those who stay in the commercial port for more than three days shall be banned and advised to enter the warehouse in order to prevent speculation. Today, it is specially telegraphed to the county government to comply, and the daily arrivals, inventory, transactions, and closing prices of each market must be investigated and reported on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Calls for Aid to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Wedemeyer stated, "China is undergoing a revolutionary and evolutionary stage. The high illiteracy rate in China makes it difficult to expect genuine democratic procedures."</p>
<p>He continued: "Even so, we, the American people, should support the Chinese people's motive to improve their cultural situation and support them in wisely and practically building their government. I retain my confidence that Chairman Chiang is sincere in practicing these goals. If foreign countries (especially the United States and the Soviet Union) can provide assistance or interference, Chairman Chiang's ability to achieve these goals will greatly progress. The post-war situation in the Far East is similar to that in Europe, with a chaotic economy, political division, and widespread awakening. The Soviet Union is fully utilizing the disorganized and turbulent situation in this region, as it did in Europe.</p>
<p>Soviet propaganda and Soviet support for the Chinese Communists make it difficult for China to establish [stability]. In addition, corruption within the National Government is also greatly hindering stability and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer said: "The Chinese people only seek any government that can provide food and shelter, and do not have time to consider the complex issues involved in leaning towards the Soviet Union." He warned that the reputation of the government is now declining and said, "In the conflict of various concepts and the power struggles of general political leaders, millions of innocent men, women, and children are being drawn into the vortex. This is a common example. I believe that the Americans and overseas Chinese should do their best to help these unfortunate people. I agree that our assistance must be targeted at those who deserve it, and not be an accomplice to unruly military and political leaders. According to my interpretation of American policy, we are not trying to impose our economic and political institutions on other people, but we are trying to create an environment where people have the freedom to express their opinions on how and by whom they are governed, and to protect individual freedom and establish courtesy in human relations. I admire and respect the Chinese people and deeply feel that they deserve our friendly assistance, but with one provision, that this assistance must be supervised to ensure that the honorable Chinese people receive this assistance. If the American people are asked to assist in strengthening the position of certain people or groups who are undermining the United Nations Charter, this would be the most unfortunate thing."</p>
<p>U.S. Congressman Cole's Remarks Support Bullitt's Proposal</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 16th] Republican Congressman Cole of the U.S. Congressional Military Survey Team to Okinawa stated at a press conference here: "I strongly agree with former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt's proposal to lend one billion U.S. dollars to aid China. This matter should be supervised by MacArthur. If he cannot, it should be presided over by General Wedemeyer."</p>
<p>[United Press, Detroit, 16th] The American Council of Christian Churches resolved today to request President Truman to aid China in order to save China, and even the world.</p>
<p>The resolution stated that unless we act decisively at this moment, the world is destined to suffer the most terrible bloodshed and unimaginable destruction.</p>
<p>British Press and Parliamentary Leaders Request the Abolition of the Potsdam Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th, United Press] The British government is currently under pressure from the press and parliamentary leaders to declare the abolition of the Potsdam Agreement and to endorse the theory of dividing the world into two, namely the separation of the Soviet Union and Western countries. Liberal Party leader and parliamentary minority leader Davies recently visited Prime Minister Attlee, requesting the abandonment of the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] It has been learned that, according to the Gallup Opinion Research Institute's survey results, Secretary of State Marshall is even more popular than former Secretary of State Hull was during his tenure. Eight out of ten survey votes praised Mr. Marshall's difficult work in the State Department.</p>

<h3>U.S. to Formally Propose to the United Nations Assistance to Korea in Achieving Independence Advocates Forming a Committee to Supervise Elections and Negotiating Troop Withdrawal After Government is Established</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] Authoritative sources stated today: The United States may formally raise the issue of Korean independence at today's meeting of the 57-nation Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The United States will not propose a trusteeship arrangement, but will propose allowing Korean independence, but with a transitional period before the government is established. The withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops should take place after the government is established, so as to avoid internal unrest in Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] It was learned today: The United States is about to formally propose a Korean independence plan to the UN General Assembly in response to the Soviet Union's simultaneous troop withdrawal request, and has already notified China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of the plan in advance. It recommends gradually implementing the wartime Allies' promise to restore Korean independence, requiring the United Nations agency to comply with this procedure, appointing a committee to monitor the election of a national assembly in Korea, then establishing a government, and then the United States and the Soviet Union will negotiate troop withdrawal with the Korean government. However, the United States will refuse direct supervision by the United Nations agency, believing that the primary responsibility belongs to the four countries of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The opposition to immediate troop withdrawal is similar to the opposition to the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Palestine, in order to avoid creating a vacuum in Korea and causing chaos.</p>
<h3>British Representative Jones Reaffirms Determination to Withdraw from the Holy Land as Soon as Possible Refuses to Implement the UN Plan Alone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] British Colonial Secretary Jones told the UN Palestine Committee today that the British government is willing to clearly declare its determination to terminate the Palestine mandate and withdraw from Palestine within a limited period. We believe that when the UN decides on the nature of the solution, it should also decide on the method of implementing the solution. It would be unreasonable to assign the British government to be solely responsible for the administration of Palestine and to implement the reforms deemed necessary by the United Nations agency.</p>
<p>It is heard that there have been suggestions that during the transitional period before Palestine's full independence, the United Kingdom should be responsible for implementing the policies of the United Nations agency under the assistance plan proposed by the U.S. representatives. The British government hereby wishes to clearly state that the United Kingdom has not only decided to terminate the Palestine mandate, but has also decided to withdraw from Palestine within a certain period. However, the British government is willing to: after the establishment of a Jewish-Arab settlement, continue the administration of Palestine for a limited transitional period; consider being invited to participate in the implementation of the solution together with other United Nations member states. In short, the British government will never accept sole or major responsibility.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] Arab countries are making a final stand, intending to refer the possible UN decision to partition Palestine to the International Court of Justice for review. Representatives of Syria and Egypt proposed to the Palestine Committee that the United Nations should postpone voting until the International Court of Justice determines whether the United Nations has the authority to decide on this matter.</p>
<h3>Debate on the Holy Land Partition Problem Concludes The Strength of the Proponents and Opponents is Equal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] The general debate of the UN Special Committee on Palestine concluded yesterday. Regarding the partition of the Holy Land, according to the speech records, 14 countries support it and 12 countries oppose it. The strength of the two sides is equal, making it difficult to reach a conclusion. The ultimate fate of the partition plan depends on the opinions of the 31 countries that have not yet spoken, but they may not announce their positions before the vote.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly to Convene Next Monday The Dispute over Security Council Membership Awaits Resolution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly has been scheduled to convene a plenary session at 4 PM and 8 PM standard time next Monday to resume voting to resolve the dispute between India and Ukraine over a seat on the Security Council. In last month's plenary session, nine votes were held for this seat, and neither India nor Ukraine obtained the required majority, making it impossible to resolve. Reliable sources say that India is preparing to formally propose the principle of geographical distribution of non-permanent members. United Nations personnel believe that if Czechoslovakia can agree to succeed Poland as a member, this dispute may not occur.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Bloc Unanimously Opposes the "Little Assembly" Proposal Special Attention to the "Acheson Plan"</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 17th] The UN Political Committee continued to discuss the establishment of a standing committee proposed by Marshall today. During yesterday's meeting, India, the Netherlands, Greece, and Sweden all expressed support in principle, but Poland and Belarus joined the Slavic bloc in expressing opposition.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 16th] The Slavic bloc today formally mentioned the so-called "Acheson Plan" compiled by Acheson, which is widely discussed among the general public and published in the "Foreign Affairs" quarterly. The plan generally suggests: that several member states of the United Nations establish supplementary agreements in which all countries can participate, stipulating that participants must implement the obligations stipulated in the Charter to resist armed aggression; that this agreement, after being decided by more than two-thirds of the signatory countries, can be implemented according to the provisions of the Charter that require collective action, when the Security Council fails to act. It is heard that Acheson's plan has been supported by Vandenberg and several other influential figures in the U.S. diplomatic community. Judging from the attacks made by Belarus, the Kremlin is clearly very concerned about all aspects of this plan.</p>
<h3>Two Republican Giants in the U.S. Demand Strengthening the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Columbus, Ohio, 16th] Republican presidential candidates Stassen and Taft both agreed today that world peace has not been lost. Stassen called the Democratic Party the "party of hidden worries" and called for strengthening the United Nations to help the world live together in peace. Taft denounced Soviet diplomats stationed at the United Nations, but said that the United Nations "remains the hope for future world peace."</p>
<h3>All German Parties Protest the Compensation Plan Promulgated by the U.S. and Britain The U.S. and Britain State That Orders Must Be Enforced for Dismantling Factories</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Berlin Radio reported: The Advisory Committee of Germans in the British Zone, in protest against the Anglo-American compensation plan made public today, decided to stop working at a meeting in Hamburg today. At the plenary session of the Advisory Committee of Germans in the British Zone, all committee members, in order to express their protest, disregarded the wishes of the British military government and withdrew from the meeting in a group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the German left and right-wing parties unanimously opposed the compensation plan. Entrepreneurs, economists, and trade union leaders in Hamburg fear that this plan will make Hamburg a barbaric place. The Secretary-General of the Joint Committee of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union stated that this compensation plan is an interference in Germany's economic life, and the consequences cannot be estimated for a while. The headquarters of the Communist Party in North Rhine-Westphalia also issued a statement, stating that the dismantling of factories will seriously affect the economic foundation of democratic construction, as well as the possibility of offsetting compensation with manufactured goods. British Commissioner Blair in the Hamburg area has warned Hamburg political leaders and trade union personnel that if they resist the dismantling by means of passive resistance or strikes, they will be regarded by European countries as Germany's unwillingness to repent.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The Anglo-American military government plans today to dismantle 687 German factories and arsenals to pay for compensation. This plan is determined to be implemented, regardless of the German side's opposition. The dismantling work should be completed as soon as possible to accelerate the economic recovery of Europe. Only 69 factories remain to be dismantled in the U.S. occupation zone, and it is expected that no unexpected incidents will occur. U.S. Army Commander Hayes solemnly stated that the orders must be enforced, "resorting to force if necessary."</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Secretary-General Criticizes the New Conservative Party</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Cabinet Secretary-General Nishio met with a group of journalists in Osaka on the 17th and clarified the government's views on the recent political situation, saying: "Recently, Liberal Party President Yoshida believes that Japan must establish a new conservative party and form a strong government organized by a single party in preparation for participating in the peace conference. Therefore, he requested a general election before the peace conference. However, the government believes that this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Hoping that All Parties Will Cooperate, Not Wanting to Dissolve Parliament</p>
<p>Even if a general election is held, the existing parties such as the Socialist, Democratic, National Cooperative, and Communist parties will all coexist with the new conservative party and will not disappear. The truly united government that is necessary for participating in the peace conference will still have to be a coalition cabinet similar to the current one. Therefore, on this position, the current government can only hope that the opposition parties will join the government and will not consider dissolving parliament and holding a general election.</p>
<p>Confident in Coping with Labor Offensive</p>
<p>Secondly, there have been rumors recently that there will be a political change in November, but these are all unfounded rumors. The reason for these rumors is that it is believed that by November, the labor offensive will intensify, with the correction of the 1,800-yen base wage as the center. However, the General Confederation of Labor, which currently occupies more than half of the unions, firmly supports the Katayama Cabinet, so the labor offensive can also be resolved. Moreover, the supplementary budget is also expected to be limited to about 80 billion yen, so there is no place for further inflation.</p>
<p>Understanding Can Be Reached on the Issue of Left-Wing Members Within the Party</p>
<p>It is also rumored that my opposition to Agriculture Minister Hirano has led to disunity within the cabinet and that a dispute is about to occur within the Socialist Party. I would like to state that this matter can be understood in the near future. This problem is due to slightly opposing views on the handling of the left-wing members of the Socialist Party, because Agriculture Minister Hirano said that the left-wing will always be the left-wing and wants to cut ties with them. But in fact, due to changes in the surrounding situation, there is no so-called left-wing anymore, and it is natural for us to be able to coordinate with them.</p>
<h3>Stalin Tells British Parliamentarians that the Soviet Union is Willing to Cooperate with Western Europe Hoping to Unite Forces to Engage in Construction</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 17th] Stalin told British left-wing Labor Party parliamentarians when he met them in Saki on the Black Sea earlier this week that "the Soviet Union does not want an Iron Curtain. If we unite our forces to engage in reconstruction, the Iron Curtain will not exist." According to members of the parliamentary delegation, Stalin said that the United Kingdom and Western European countries must cooperate economically with the Soviet Union and Eastern democracies. Cooperation can drive away the demons of war. According to British parliamentarians: "After visiting countries such as the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, we are more convinced that there is a need to cooperate with Eastern countries. We have found that the Soviet Union is ready and willing to sign a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, and we sincerely hope that this negotiation can be resumed."</p>
<h3>Far East Tribunal Releases Japanese War Criminals Prosecutor Explains Reasons Says the Emperor and Business Community Have No War Crimes</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Since the prosecutors of the Tokyo Military Tribunal for the Far East announced the decision not to prosecute 23 Class A Japanese war criminals a month ago, people from all countries have been criticizing it. Chief Prosecutor Kipping of the International Prosecutor's Office published a statement on this matter in the "Japan Times," believing that Japanese industrialists have no crime of manufacturing war.</p>
<p>Kipping said: "It has now been decided that the Japanese Emperor and business figures will not be subject to war crimes trials. This matter has caused some controversy in the past two years, but now it has come to an end. Japanese industrialists do not have sufficient evidence to believe that they should bear war responsibility. Although there has been some discussion that the Japanese Emperor and major industrialists should be subject to war crimes trials, after a long investigation, this discussion cannot find proper reasons. We have no example of anyone providing a plan or starting a joint agreement to participate in the war by major figures in the Japanese business and industrial community, and this supporting evidence cannot be collected. Of course, we are also unwilling to unconditionally declare that a certain group or the entire group is innocent. After consideration, we believe that those who participated in planning at the beginning of the war should be the object of accusation. There are no figures from the Japanese business community among the 25 war criminal suspects who are currently on trial, such as Tojo, and this is no coincidence. Japanese industrialists are different from German industrialists. In Germany, Hitler rode on a horse, and figures from the industrial community led the horse, but Japanese bankers or business leaders led the horse under the threat of guns."</p>
<h3>Japanese Exports to Increase Prices The National Treasury No Longer Subsidizes Trade Funds</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The restoration of Japan's foreign trade has made it difficult for the Ministry of Finance to cope with the issue of trade funds. It is reported that last year (fiscal year 1946) had already been short more than 3 billion yen. According to the current import and export situation, by the end of this year, the deficit will be as high as more than 16 billion yen. The only way to make up for it is to increase the price of exports and reduce the price of imports such as food. Consumer goods will still be priced at the current domestic price, and the higher prices paid by consumers will compensate for trade losses. The Trade Agency and the Ministry of Finance are currently in negotiations. In addition, the Trade Agency is studying methods to increase exports, and will determine the conversion rate of yen by referring to foreign market prices. Exports that have the potential to increase prices will be increased in the future. The Japanese government has also decided that the national treasury will no longer continue to bear the foreign trade fees. Trade funds will be completely balanced by adjusting trade prices.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Steps Up Aid to France and Will Issue Huge Amounts of Gold and Silver European Representatives Urge the U.S. to Provide Assistance Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources say that France is expected to receive new financial assistance from the U.S. this weekend, and will receive gold and silver seized from Axis countries by the Allies, worth approximately 90 to 100 million U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Two European leaders of the "Marshall Plan" stated today: If the U.S. fails to provide appropriate assistance in a timely manner, the future of Europe will be a real disaster. The two are Franks, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the European Economic Cooperation Conference, and Alphand, Secretary-General. According to Franks, the report of the Paris Conference was based on the economic level of Europe in 1947. Afterwards, the situation deteriorated, making the smooth implementation of the Marshall Plan more difficult.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations Supports the Third Party's Election Campaign</h3>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 16th] Jack Kroll, Director of the Political Action Committee of the U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations, told reporters at a reception on the 16th that the Congress of Industrial Organizations will support the third party in the 1948 presidential election.</p>
<h3>The French Labor Strike Remains Deadlocked The Government Deploys Troops into Paris</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The French government deployed troops into Paris on the 16th. The troops were carrying tents and full equipment. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of the Army refused to comment on the movement of these troops, which may be related to the labor strike situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] Although the two small unions in Paris, the Christian Workers and the Autonomous Workers' Groups, which participated in the strike three days ago, have decided to resume work, the government also hopes to use it to restore the tram traffic throughout Paris, but it failed. On the 17th, there was still no public transportation in the entire city of Paris.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] The French labor strike has shown signs of resolution today. Among the 700,000 striking workers, 3,000 have decided to resume work. Prime Minister Ramadier has been consulting with various unions overnight in order to clarify the labor situation before the Paris City Council election on Sunday.</p>

It is expected that the result will have a major impact on the future direction of the anti-Franco faction. The meeting between the two is the first meeting since the eve of the Spanish Civil War. London Spanish Republican figures believe that the two will discuss the possibility of taking joint action to restore democratic rule in Spain.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Invents a New Radio-Controlled Bomb</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 16th] The Franklin Institute has invented a radio-controlled bomb that does not need to be transported by aircraft and can be directed as desired in both forward and backward separation and left and right directions.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Unlikely to Be Optimistic; The Berlin Four-Power Structure Should Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Lieutenant General Robertson, who is about to succeed Douglas as the Deputy Military Governor of the British Zone in Germany, stated at a press conference in Berlin on the 16th that he believes even if the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in November fails to reach an agreement on Germany, the four occupying powers will continue their current quadripartite structure in Berlin.</p>
<p>Without a consensus-based agreement among the powers, there can be no appropriate solution not only for Germany but also for all issues concerning Europe. The Berlin Four-Power structure serves as a bridge between East and West, and I do not believe that any leader of these four allied nations intends to dismantle this bridge.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the authorities took active measures, the price surge in the city has tended to stabilize, but the price of common newsprint has risen sharply and there is a shortage of supply, which is obviously due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market. The Economic Division of the Police Bureau has been secretly investigating since the day before yesterday, and yesterday afternoon they dispatched a large number of economic police officers, led by officers, to begin their operation.

<h3>Thousands of Seized Telegrams Carried to the Capital Overnight for Review; Merchants in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin Secretly Report Black Market Prices to Each Other via Commercial Telegrams</h3>
<p>[East China News] Premier Zhang Qun believes that merchants are using the convenience of telecommunications to report market conditions to each other, directly raising prices and affecting people's livelihood. He issued an urgent telegram to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, ordering an investigation into commercial telegrams sent to and received from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin by the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and international radio stations since the 11th of this month.

<h3>Encourage Reporting of Black Market Gold and Banknotes; Restrictions on Rewards Temporarily Lifted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 12th Economic Inspection Conference is scheduled to be held in the City Hall conference room at 10:00 AM today. Furthermore, due to the rampant black market trading of gold and foreign currency in the city, the Economic Inspection Conference believes that in order to encourage citizens to provide information and to facilitate the inspection work, it is appropriate not to place numerical limits on the proportion of rewards given to informants and those who contribute to the handling of cases. After the City Government telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for approval, it has been learned that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed back a few days ago, temporarily approving the removal of restrictions and granting rewards at rates of one to two percent.</p>

<h3>Before Requisitioning Land Enclosed During the War, the Railway Bureau Negotiates Rental Payments with Residents</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." enclosed civilian land in the Qiujiang Road and Mingde Road area, and the buildings built on that land were taken over by the Two Railway Bureaus after the victory. The main industries in several areas requested their return, and the Two Railway Bureaus intend to requisition them in accordance with the law and have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. Before the Executive Yuan's instructions and approval are issued, the bureau and various business owners agreed yesterday that from October 1945 to May of this year, the Two Railway Bureaus would pay a monthly rental fee of 125,000 yuan per mu (unit of land area). From June to the end of this month, the monthly rental fee per mu will increase to 350,000 yuan.

<h3>Italian Monk to Promote Buddhism Around the World; Giving Sermons Starting Tomorrow; Firmly Believes This Is the Path to Truth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Italian monk Luo Genna arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago and has taken up residence at Wangfo Temple. He is scheduled to give sermons at the Buddhist Jingye Society starting tomorrow. Luo Genna is a prominent monk in Italy, born in Italy but raised in the United States, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Influenced by Master Dharma, he changed his entire outlook on life and converted to the Three Jewels, becoming a devout Buddhist. One of his brothers is currently a bishop in Rome. Despite being brothers, they each pursue truth through their respective faiths.</p>
<p>This time, the monk came to Shanghai via Burma, Penang, and Singapore, preaching and promoting Buddhism along the way. After preaching in Shanghai, he plans to travel to Manila and Honolulu before heading to the United States. He will establish a Buddhist publishing house in New York, planning to publish a Buddhist bible that collects all the essences of Buddhism in one volume. He also plans to build a skyscraper in New York to pray for world peace, expressing the spirit of promoting Buddhism in the United States.</p>
<p>Luo Genna has walked across southern Europe, Central Asia, and many other countries. In 1925, he spent eight years in seclusion in Burma, meditating and attaining enlightenment, and then decided to travel the world to promote Buddhism. The monk is also the founder and leader of the World Buddhist Propagation Association and has organized Buddhist preaching expeditions, leading believers from various places to visit famous Buddhist sites.</p>
<p>The monk has a kind appearance and a natural demeanor. When meeting with reporters, he said that he firmly believes that only Buddhism can show the path to truth in the current world. His motto is "Do and do bravely, regardless of all obstacles." He said that life is a dream, and there is no permanent life in the world, so people should love others as themselves, and even small animals should be cared for. Only through Buddhism can the world be saved, and only through boundless love can boundless hatred in the world be eliminated. If Buddhism and science go hand in hand, the world can be saved. Science alone is enough to destroy the world.</p>
<p>When reporters asked about his views on Chinese Buddhism, he said that he greatly admires the hard work of Chinese monks, deeply believing in the principle of "better to wear out than rust." The monk also said that it is currently the Buddhist year 2491. By the year 2500, Buddhism will be able to reach its peak and illuminate the world. There are only eight years left to strive for its realization, so he has deep hopes for preaching in the United States.</p>
<p>It is reported that the monk's four-part sermon program is: Buddhism is a science that saves people and the world. How to achieve complete virtue and wisdom. Buddhist studies are scientific doctrines. Subduing the ego with truth. He is scheduled to give sermons at 5:30 PM every day starting tomorrow at the Buddhist Jingye Society, 418 Hecheng Road, and plans to broadcast Buddhist teachings on the Great American Radio Station every morning.</p>

<h3>Central Mint Planning to Supplement Missing Parts; Restoration of Coinage Only a Matter of Time; Machinery from Northeast China to Be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Mint in Zhabei suffered severe losses during the war. At the beginning of the restoration after the victory, the factory compiled a budget and submitted it to the ministry, estimating that the cost of restoring the factory would be 10.2 billion yuan. However, the Ministry of Finance reduced it to 4.5 billion yuan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. Meanwhile, 2.5 billion yuan was allocated as restoration funds. Later, when Song Ziwen was the head of the Executive Yuan, he ordered the restoration plan to be postponed. The Ministry of Finance repeatedly requested the Executive Yuan to maintain the original proposal, but the matter remains unresolved. The factory believes that the budget at the time of the victory is no longer applicable due to price factors. It has recently recompiled a budget, estimating that it will require 30 billion national currency and 2-3 million US dollars, and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment and to find that the coinage machinery left by the former "Japan-Manchuria" in Northeast China can supplement the missing parts, is currently negotiating with the Central Bank to advance 4 billion yuan as the cost of transporting the machinery to Shanghai. The Mint has also sent personnel to Northeast China to start investigating everything. However, due to inconvenient transportation and the arrival of severe winter, it is difficult to determine when the transportation will begin. According to general observations, it is believed that the restoration of the Central Mint is only a matter of time. Even if metal currency is not minted in the future, the minting of subsidiary coins is inevitable. No country in the world, apart from its main currency, uses non-metallic subsidiary coins.</p>

<h3>Domestic Kerosene Should Not Be Banned; Nine Refineries Explain Reasons: Can Save Foreign Exchange and Benefit People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Price Review Council decided to ban "artificial kerosene" because the raw material used, diesel, harms the proper industrial use of diesel. Yesterday, nine oil refineries, including the Yongda Oil Industry Association, invited the press to appeal, stating that the name "artificial kerosene" was corrected to domestic kerosene at the Petroleum Management Meeting of the Public Utilities Bureau on April 17th, because imported kerosene is also refined from diesel. Now, domestic factories are refining it themselves, and after repeated improvements, the product is no longer inferior to imported products. Once China develops oil fields, the establishment of oil refineries will be strongly promoted. There are currently more than 20 oil refineries of all sizes in Shanghai, with more than 1,000 workers, all of which are of considerable scale. It would be unwise to summarily ban them, destroying the emerging national industry and creating a large number of unemployed workers. If the government can increase diesel imports and reduce kerosene imports, allocate a portion of diesel to various oil refineries, and stipulate the output quantity to be sold by the government at parity prices, it would not only save foreign exchange, but also benefit people's livelihood. Currently, the selling price of diesel is only 4.06 million yuan per ton, while kerosene requires 8.34 million yuan per ton. Eighty percent of diesel can be refined into kerosene, and there are also by-products of mineral oil, which is far more cost-effective than importing kerosene from abroad. Finally, it was pointed out that the move to ban domestic kerosene this time was instigated by foreign merchants, who feared that they would lose their ability to manipulate the kerosene market after the Chinese refined kerosene themselves, so they used this excuse to ask the government to ban it.</p>
<h3>US Military Court Opens Trial for Theft and Sale of Empty Gasoline Barrels; No Way to Investigate Related Russian National Who Returned to His Country; Zhou Genshou Admits to Being Entrusted to Resell</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The case of Major Frederick Piers, a member of the US Military Advisory Group, stealing and selling a large number of empty US military gasoline barrels to Chinese merchants opened in the US Military Court at the American Cemetery in the Racecourse on the 15th. It is alleged that on July 15, Piers colluded with Georgy, a Russian national serving in the Supply Office, to sell 600 empty US military gasoline barrels stored in Jiangwan through Zhou Genshou, who repaired typewriters at the office, to a Zhou姓 (surname Zhou) on Lafayette Road, obtaining two gold bars and $1,200 USD. Initially, this was not discovered. On August 1, Piers again sold 540 empty gasoline barrels to Wang Jinrong, who lived at No. 14 Chenjia Bridge, Yiyun North Lane, South Railway Station, stating that the value was $1,600 USD, to be paid after delivery. Just as they were about to be shipped out from Jiangwan Airport, they were discovered by the guards of the Chinese Air Force. Wang Jinrong and Piers were detained, and all 540 gasoline barrels were returned to the Air Force. Georgy, the Russian national involved in the case, has already returned to his country and cannot be investigated. As for whether the two gold bars and $1,200 USD paid for the first transaction were taken back by Georgy, or split equally, or stored elsewhere, it remains to be investigated. The whereabouts of the barrels missing from the first transaction is also under strict investigation. On the 15th and 16th, the US Military Court held closed-door trials, summoning witnesses and Chen Chang, the former Major Chief of the Second Section of the Second Service Brigade of the Chinese Air Force.</p>
<p>The trial continued yesterday morning. Sakura, who previously worked for the US military and is now employed by Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft (DAPG) , testified that in July of this year, Major Piers asked her to sign a shipping manifest, stating that 540 gasoline barrels were sold for $1,600 USD, and then handed it over to Wang Jinrong. At this time, Piers's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Bowie, said that prosecutor Major Mackey did not provide photographs as evidence, and that Major Piers did not sign, and should not be held responsible. Presiding Officer Colonel Palmer corrected him. Piers's female secretary, Bernaldo, then testified that she had encountered Sha three times at Piers's place, and had seen Piers and Sha have one very long conversation. In the afternoon, Zhou Genshou testified that he was ordered by Major Piers to have Georgy entrust him to</p>
<p>find a way to resell . As for the Zhou who made the purchase, he was introduced by two of my friends, and I don't know him. After the second incident occurred, Georgy came to tell me again that Major Piers had ordered me to go to the Chinese Air Force Headquarters to find the person in charge and see if I could find a way to help. After I went to that place, I only saw the gasoline barrels. Wang Jinrong was reportedly handed over to the Chinese Air Force Headquarters on the afternoon of August 1. Yesterday's trial was not completed, and the court will continue the trial at 9:00 AM this morning, summoning other witnesses and Wang Jinrong, etc.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers from the Rear Area Arrive in Shanghai and Beg for Relief After Starving for Two Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than one hundred unemployed workers arriving in Shanghai from the rear area formed a line yesterday morning to surround Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau. They demanded a continued supply of meals because the unemployed workers' reception center had been ordered to dissolve on the 15th, and the supply of meals had been stopped from that day, leaving the unemployed workers to starve for two days. Deputy Director Li agreed to give each person 12,000 yuan for lunch, ordered them to return to the center first, and also issued half a month's ration of rice. According to Deputy Director Li, the Executive Yuan has agreed to provide blankets, cotton clothing, and severance pay for the dismissal of these workers. If they return to their hometowns, the government is also prepared to provide assistance, he said.</p>
<h3>Xiao Linggui's Estate Totals 2.1 Billion; Yue Opera Circle Expresses Two Points; Suicide Was Not Due to Economic Hardship; No Illicit Affairs During Her Lifetime</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The issues surrounding the estate of the famous Yue opera actress Xiao Dangui have been causing quite a lot of disputes. Xiao Ling's estate is estimated to be around 2.1 billion yuan, including her own real estate in Hangzhou valued at 600 million yuan, 400 million yuan in savings, and opera costumes, jewelry, gold bars, etc. Her husband, Zhang Chunfan, has already compiled a list, signed it, and sent it to Huang Jinrong. The day before yesterday, Xiao Ling's brother, Qian Boquan, came to Shanghai from Shengxian County, and Huang specifically gave the list to Qian, instructing him to take the lead in handling everything. Qian only hopes for the following regarding his sister's death: Xiao Ling's coffin should be moved back to Shengxian County and buried in the original coffin to avoid unnecessary expenses; the entire estate of Xiao Ling should be inherited by him; the funeral expenses, including the 200 million yuan in compensation for the Paradise Theater's losses, totaling 600 million yuan, should be the responsibility of Zhang Chunfan; he does not recognize the marital relationship between Xiao Ling and Zhang Chunfan. However, nine people from the opera circle, including Yuan Yunfen and Chuan Quanxiang, believe that the handing over of Xiao Ling's estate depends on two points: Xiao Ling's suicide was definitely not due to economic reasons. Even if the rumored 600 million yuan of debt before Xiao Ling's death were true, the current amount of the estate would be more than enough to repay it. Furthermore, Xiao Ling lived a frugal life and rarely went outdoors. The rumors of her having illicit affairs with others are definitely not true. They will continue to negotiate with Zhang Chunfan based on these two points and appeal to the outside world to uphold justice to clarify the truth about Xiao Ling's suicide. It is said that Yin Guifang, one of the famous Yue opera actresses, will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong twenty days from now. At that time, they plan to jointly hold a grand memorial service for Xiao Ling. Furthermore, the Hongguang Theater will stage a Yue opera about Xiao Ling's unjust death, which is expected to cause a sensation again.</p>
<h3>Tragedy on Yangshupu Road: Truck Collides with Tram; Fifteen Injured, One Dead</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 6:30 PM the day before yesterday at the intersection of Yangshupu and Linqing Roads, a tram number 73, traveling west to east, collided with a truck number 65265 from the Materials Supply Bureau, traveling east to west. Because a vehicle from the China Agricultural Machinery Company was stopped in front, the truck number 65265 veered to the left. Unexpectedly, the front of the truck slipped and collided with the tram. Both male and female passengers were severely injured. Guo Yuzhen, Ding Jinzhou, Sun Guoxiang, Pan Fulin, Cai Yuanming, Jiang Yushan, Wu Jinfu, Li Genming, Sun Jiehao, Tang Xiaomei, Wang Shaomin, Zhou Jianqi, Huang Shenzhi, Shen Binbao, Lin Sheng, and Zheng Bailin all suffered injuries to the head, forehead, chest, back, and limbs. After receiving the report, the Yangshupu Precinct, led by Chief Wang, rushed to the scene to investigate. The injured were sent to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. Jiang Yushan died a few minutes after arriving at the hospital due to severe injuries. The drivers of both vehicles, Huang Pingzhong and Liu Chuanrong, were taken to the precinct for questioning. Huang Pingzhong, the driver from the Supply Bureau, was ordered to be detained, and a letter of indictment was sent to the District Procuratorate for further investigation. Among the fifteen people hospitalized, Guo Yuzhen, Li Genming, Sun Jiehao, Tang Xiaomei, Zhou Jianqi, and Huang Shenzhi were still in critical condition as of last night. It is reported that the injured on the Supply Bureau's passenger truck were all workers.</p>
<h3>Two Actresses Reduced to Prostitution; Sisters Kidnapped and Fled to Shanghai; From Nantong, Heading to Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Yushan, a 59-year-old Shandong native residing at No. 2 Xiaobaojia Lane in Nantong City, was formerly a performer. He adopted four daughters: Hai Cha, Hai Hong, Hai Yun, and Hai Lian. Hai Lian is ill at home, and Hai Yun was kidnapped by a soldier last spring. Currently, only Hai Xiang (19 years old) and Hai Hong (17 years old) earn a living by performing. Last year, they had no performances, and the two sisters were reduced to prostitution. Two soldiers, Liao Guoan and Yuan Ming (quartermaster), both had sexual relations with them. On the 12th of this month, Liao and Yuan invited the two girls to watch a movie at the Xin Xin Theater and agreed to meet at the bus station the next morning. The four of them took a long-distance bus to Yangzhou, stayed overnight, and on the third day, they went to Zhenjiang and then to Shanghai. They stayed at the home of Liao's father-in-law at No. 40, Lane 751, Lingao Road, Pingliang Road. On the 16th, they went to Liao's father, Zhi Liang's residence at No. 40, Jing'an Villa, Nanjing West Road, where the four of them slept on the floor. After the two daughters disappeared, Li Yushan learned that they had been kidnapped by Liao and Yuan and that Liao's Shanghai contact address was No. 40, Jing'an Villa. He tracked them to Shanghai and loitered in the lane all day. In the evening, he caught sight of the Hai Hong sisters going out to play and called the police to take them to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. The police rushed to Liao's residence, but Liao and Yuan had already fled upon hearing the news. According to Hai Hong and others, the boat tickets had been bought, and they were scheduled to go to Qingdao together on the 18th. After interrogation, the sub-bureau plans to transfer the two girls to the Jiliang Institute, while the two soldiers, Liao and Yuan, are still being pursued.</p>

<h3>Embodying Experimentation in Relief: New Facilities of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th (Airmail)] Located beside the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, the "Shangri-La" of Huatan Creek curves into an "S" shape, covering an area of approximately 300 acres, with twenty-odd new-style houses. A large wooden sign reads: "Embodying Experimentation in Relief, Advancing the Great Question of Mankind." At first glance, visitors realize that they have stepped into the Chongqing Experimental Relief Institute of the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>The Relief Institute is divided into six sections: Home for the Elderly, Vocational Training Center, Home for the Disabled, Orphanage, Medical Center, and Maternity Home. Each section has its own person in charge and forms a separate unit.</p>
<p>The Home for the Disabled currently has 20 deaf-mute students (5 female), 23 blind students (4 female), and 23 lame students (8 female). Deaf-mute teacher Rui Gufeng graduated from the vocational class for the deaf in the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf. He cannot speak, but he can use gestures to train the deaf-mute students in "conversation." Another teacher of pronunciation, Jiang Mingjian, has a missing arm and leg. Originally a refugee receiving relief, he was successfully educated by the institute and also serves as a teacher. He said: "Deaf-mute students practice pronunciation entirely using phonetic symbols, but there are still three letters among the forty, 兀 (e), ㄘ (ci), and 方 (f-old) that they cannot pronounce. Even the most intelligent deaf-mute student needs three months to learn the pronunciation of these forty letters." Blind students rely entirely on tactile writing. Blind writing has a total of fifty-four letters, consisting of eighteen consonants and thirty-six vowels. One consonant combined with one vowel forms one blind character. Before the war, the Shanghai China Welfare Association for the Blind printed a large number of blind books and songs using machines. Due to financial difficulties, they now only use manual typesetting to publish one type of monthly publication called "Qiming," which is distributed to various schools for the blind and deaf. The government does not have an accurate statistic of how many blind, deaf, and mute disabled people there are in all of China, but the disabled who have received blind, deaf, and mute education do not have to worry about finding a way out. Their professions after graduation are mostly sacred educational work.</p>
<p>The Home for the Elderly has thirty-one elderly men (the oldest being 81), and fifty-three elderly women (the oldest being 89). The youngest age is 60. After entering the home, even the coffins are supplied by the institute. According to the statistics table, from March 31st to September of this year, twenty-four elderly people have died one after another. Their lives are comfortable. They sleep on wooden plank beds. Fishing, playing chess, and taking walks are their daily activities. There is freedom of religion: there are Buddhist halls and chapels, and on Sundays, Adventist teacher Yang Xinsheng preaches. Lin Shusen, a 62-year-old man, automatically gives lectures on "The Biography of Ji Gong" every night.</p>
<p>The most complicated and arduous work is the Vocational Training Center. Currently, there are eighty-one male members and fifteen female members, most of whom were transferred from the police bureau. Few are literate, but there is one named Chen Mianzhi, who graduated from the Department of Economics at Fudan University. The entire management is militarized, and there were many escapes in the beginning, but there are fewer now. In the morning, they learn skills, and in the afternoon, they are taught to read. Unemployed vagrants can learn skills such as gardening, fishery, animal husbandry, crafts, sewing, cotton weaving, and printing. The sewing department has eight sewing machines, the cotton weaving department has four flat carpet machines and four towel machines each, and the printing department has six lithographic presses and one rotary press. The training period is tentatively set for one year. After the period expires, the Ministry of Social Affairs' Employment Service Center will introduce them to work and maintain close contact with the institute.</p>
<p>Dr. Wei Yongqing, the director of the institute, is a social work expert. He said: "The more advanced a country is, the wider the scope of social relief is. Social relief in China is just beginning, while the United States has developed from passive social relief to universal subsidy relief. Although the relief institute currently implements out-of-hospital relief and out-of-hospital treatment subsidies, due to limited funds, it cannot actively promote them." This young student who studied in the United States has a great and lofty ideal. He is preparing to build a new type of mental hospital—one that fully applies psychology—but the question is: where will this huge sum of money come from?</p>
<p>In terms of medical equipment, the Experimental Relief Institute has four doctors, fourteen midwives and nurses, and seventy beds. Ms. Zhong Wanfang, who is in the isolation ward, once studied at Guangzhou Zhongshan University. Because the institute did not have Western medicine to treat her lung disease, she reported to Director Wei Yongqing: "There is a Chinese medicine prescription that may be able to treat it, but no patient has ever tried it to see if it is effective." She wanted the institute to provide the cost of the medicine. Because Director Wei was open-minded, he finally spent 250,000 yuan to buy her fifteen doses of medicine. According to Ms. Zhong's statement to reporters, "The symptoms are indeed much better than before. She has been taking it for more than 20 days, but it must be taken for three consecutive months to get a definite result." The Chinese medicine prescription is copied below for reference by those suffering from lung disease:</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader Gao Deng Flees to Gather Forces in East Taihu; Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters Orders Wuxian County to Dispatch Troops for Joint Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters recently received a confidential report stating that a large number of bandits have been discovered in East Taihu, gathering in the tide and near Platform Mountain. The bandit leader, named Gao Deng, is equipped with long and short firearms, carbines, and Thompson submachine guns, and specializes in robbing cargo ships. Recently, there have been attempts to disturb the border area of Xiyi County. It has been ordered that the Wuxian County Government dispatch armed land and water police to join the relevant neighboring counties to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxian County Government Formulates Two Measures: Dredging Grain Sources and Eliminating the Black Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Wuxian County Government has now received a provincial order stating that the grain supply in Jiangsu Province relies mainly on transportation from Anhui Province. Recently, due to the situation, the sources are insufficient, and grain merchants from Wuxi and Shanghai are also absorbing large quantities, causing a sharp rise in prices. In order to dredge grain sources and stabilize the market, the following measures have been formulated: Regarding the counties in northern Jiangsu, if legitimate grain merchants from southern Jiangsu go to purchase grain, they should be provided with as much convenience as possible. The county government should encourage grain merchants to raise funds to purchase and transport grain from the production areas. The four counties of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Changzhou should use the previously approved 10 billion yuan in collateral to actively purchase grain directly from the production areas to ensure sufficient inventory. Each county should order the police bureau to secretly investigate the reasons for the sharp rise and fall in grain prices, as well as the daily quantity of grain arriving from grain merchants and the transaction situation. The daily grain price should be clearly labeled and announced in the newspapers to eliminate the black market. If there are any violations, the people are allowed to report them, and rewards will be issued in accordance with the Shanghai market measures.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhishan's Family Committed Treachery and Continuously Killed 53 People; Captured in Wuxi and Escorted to Nanjing for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 16th] Yang Zhishan, from Niuyangzhuang, Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, served as the captain of the Youth Team and the captain of the Model Team of the bandit army, as well as a member of the Anti-Traitors Committee. He was ruthless and killed a large number of civil servants. He also kidnapped Yang Yu, a fellow villager, and extorted 30 dan of rice and a gold ring. Because he could not bear the harassment, Yu fled to Wuxi and lived in a thatched shed outside the East Gate. The day before yesterday, Yu learned that Yang Zhishan had arrived in Wuxi from the Dagan bandit area of Yancheng on a small wooden boat, which was docked on the riverbank of Sanliqiao outside the North Gate. He reported this to the Southern District Military Police Team and requested the arrest to avenge his previous grievances. After receiving the report, the team dispatched four plainclothes officers, along with the informant Yang Yu, to carry out the arrest. They successfully captured the bandit Yang Zhishan. During the interrogation, he claimed that after the communist New Fourth Army occupied Yancheng in 1940, his entire family participated in the work. His father was a member of the bandit army's Senior Citizens Association, his elder brother Yang Gaoshan is currently the head of Xincheng Township, his second brother Yang Qingshan works in the bandit Model Team, and his elder sister-in-law and second sister-in-law work in the bandit Women's Association. He served as the captain of the Youth Team. In March 1945, he officially joined the party. Last fall, he and his elder brother Yang Gaoshan killed Bian Chenpinjia, a subordinate of Han Deqin, former chairman of Jiangsu Province. After Yancheng fell again on August 12th of this year, he dragged 53 civil servants, including Chen Chengge, the district chief of the eighth district, Liu Linxiang, the district chief of the seventh district, Wang Yilong, the assistant of the second district, Pu Wenfu, the township chief, and Yuan Guorui, a member of the Returning Home National Corps, to Shangzhuang, where they were brutally killed. He came to Wuxi this time at the request of his elder brother Yang Gaoshan, using business as a cover to gather information about the situation of the Yancheng Huxiang Corps. At the same time, the team summoned five witnesses, Zhi Zhenyi, Dong Zhenzhi, Hua Jiefu, Dong Caiyuan, and Zhi Baiheng, to testify. The facts they stated matched Yang Zhishan's criminal behavior. On the 16th, he was handed over to the 9th Regiment Headquarters and transferred to the Capital Military Police Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Side Views of the World YWCA Conference Venue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 16th] Delegates from 23 countries around the world, selected from around the world and gathered in Hangzhou for the World YWCA Conference, have different appearances and different clothes. Among the delegates, some wear heavy furs, while others wear openwork summer cloth shirts. Chinese delegates mostly wear embroidered cheongsams, while Korean costumes are the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>Hangzhou is very cold in the morning and evening, and those from Myanmar are shivering. However, those who grew up in cold regions such as Finland still find the climate too hot.</p>
<p>As usual, at any international gathering, the venue is often full of national flags, but the World YWCA Conference is an exception. In the venue, national flags are nowhere to be seen, and there are only many fresh flowers.</p>
<p>The most unique hairstyle belongs to the Burmese, who comb their hair neatly, towering half a foot above their heads, topped with a large piece of ivory.</p>
<p>The youngest are the Czech and Mexican delegates, aged 18 and 20. Most of the others have gray or white hair.</p>
<p>The average age of the delegates is mostly over 40. According to the list of delegates, among the 102 delegates, only 42 are married women, with unmarried women accounting for the overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>Hangzhou baskets are a famous product of our country. Each delegate has one in hand, carrying documents to the venue every day.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 15th, Madame Chiang held a tea party at her private residence. The snacks prepared were purely Chinese, including: soup noodles, osmanthus sugar, and peanuts. Before leaving, each was given a bag of high-quality Longjing tea.</p>
<p>Most of the delegates are not good at using chopsticks and spend a lot of effort to eat the soup noodles.</p>
<p>Most of the delegates did not know what osmanthus sugar was, so some smelled it but did not dare to taste it. Also, most of the delegates used ivory chopsticks to try to eat peeled peanuts, but they failed repeatedly, causing laughter throughout the hall.</p>
<p>Korean women are good at singing. When invited by Madame, Korean delegate Ms. Jin Zihuan immediately sang a love song.</p>
<p>The living room of the foreign guests' reception center displays the work achievements of the YWCA in various countries during the war, with the UK, the US, and the Netherlands being the most outstanding. Germany and South Korea are missing. This is enough to fully demonstrate the heavy losses during the war, and all activities were crippled.</p>
<p>The most depressed person at the venue was the German delegate, who sat alone in a corner, silently.</p>
<p>The most active should be the Chinese delegates.</p>
<p>The person with the most diamond rings is also the Chinese delegate. (Reporter Hong Xucai)</p>

<p>A Glimpse of Industrialists' Opinions</p>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Summarizing the opinions of industrialists in this city regarding the handling of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, the following are some of the points: These goods should be released to the market as soon as possible to meet the needs of society. The government's current procurement measures freeze merchants' funds for too long, and the volatile situation is also a reason why merchants are afraid to be at ease. It would be better to confiscate all prohibited goods, and the government can purchase the permitted materials at a lower price. From the standpoint of industry, it is hoped that the government will allocate the purchased raw materials to factories at a low price. If the government requires factories to use cheap raw materials to manufacture products, pay a certain amount of processing fees and legal profits, and purchase the finished products together, it would also be a reasonable approach.</p>

Shouts of regret led to a sharp rise. After the morning, 21-count and 20-count Double Horse yarn returned to good levels of 5.8 million. Throughout the day, in addition to 40-count Blue Phoenix, 32-count Silver Moon, and 20-count Golden City Goddess yarns rising, other fine yarns remained stable. 16-count coarse yarn continued to fall by varying amounts of 500,000 to 600,000.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth opened in the morning with floating surpluses, still subject to forced sales. Furthermore, with tight credit conditions and sluggish absorption by merchant guilds, coupled with rumors of the Textile Adjustment Committee limiting exports, the market felt even more unsupported. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 7.7 million, a drop of 45,000 compared to the previous day. Five Blessings Color Ball, Zhenzhong and other brands also fell by smaller amounts, ranging from 10,000 to 40,000. Throughout the day, apart from purchases remaining stable, fine twill, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, plain cloth, khaki cloth, and other types of cloth uniformly declined by varying amounts of 10,000 to 45,000.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, selling only 963 pieces of Class A yarn to various manufacturers, equivalent to 1,429 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 528 purchase orders were submitted.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Registration Will Not Be Extended</p>
<p>[Our Report] On the 15th, the Textile Association publicly announced to all relevant trade associations that all packaged yarn and cloth within the industry as of the 16th of this month must be registered within three days. Yesterday was the final deadline. External rumors suggested an extension, but the person in charge of the association has denied this and reiterated to all relevant trade associations that the registered information should be submitted to the association as soon as possible for verification.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association's cotton yarn price negotiation remained unchanged, with 20-count yarn still priced at 15.2 million.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton transactions were very sparse, and the market was generally weak. There was an ample supply of lots on the market, with many sellers and few buyers. Prices were unsupported and continued to decline, with few transactions. The highest price actually traded was 4.3 million, a decrease of 200,000 from the previous day. Other trades were minimal. The trend was extremely soft, with 620 bales traded. The price for factory delivery was 4.45 million for 1 1/16-inch American cotton, 4.2 million for European cotton, and the price for delivery at the warehouse was 4.2 million to 4.3 million for Lingdou cotton, 3.25 million to 3.3 million for Huoji cotton, and 650,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>
<p>Straight Stripe Serge Scarce</p>
<p>Straight stripe serge in various colors and patterns is extremely scarce. Only Huaxin, Dacheng, Dachun, and Yonghe in the Qipan Street area have some goods, and other stores rarely sell them. General shops are even more depleted. Due to the long absence of imported goods, old stocks are being sold at opportune moments. Because local factories consider the profits from producing serge to be less lucrative than those from flannelette, they have successively reduced production. Currently, due to the cold weather, demand from clothing and shoe industries is rising, and customer purchases are particularly strong. Therefore, the value of this serge is becoming increasingly popular, and the market is rising quietly. Yesterday, the ordinary price for each yard was over 900,000.</p>
<h3>Although Banks Extended Credit, No Loosening of Money Supply Was Seen</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, national banks extended 4.3 billion yuan at the clearing house. The tight money situation remained the same in the morning, improving slightly in the afternoon. However, cash was still tight, with an implicit interest rate of 2.2%. Outside the stock exchange, Hua shares were discounted by 3%. In the detailed breakdown of clearings, the Central Bank issued 8.8 billion yuan, with a large clearing inflow of 24.6 billion yuan, foreign merchants inflowed 29.4 billion yuan, small clearing outflowed 59.7 billion yuan, the Bank of China inflowed 12 billion yuan, and other banks had slight inflows and outflows.</p>
<h3>Arrival Sources Gradually Thriving, Inventory Increased; Black Market for Coal Expected to Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Coal Management Committee recently reported that the arrival of coal has increased due to improved transportation on the northern rail lines. It is estimated that over 200,000 tons of coal will arrive this month (including over 10,000 tons of Taiwanese coal). Regarding white coal, the committee recently ordered 20,000 tons of Hongji white coal, which will be shipped successively from November this year until the end of April next year. At the same time, it is negotiating with the Jiaozuo Zhongfu Coal Mine to transport over 100,000 tons of white coal stored in that mine to solve the fuel problem for industrial workers and public educators. Furthermore, the committee's emergency coal reserve has reached 200,000 tons by the end of last month. It is expected that the target coal reserve of 300,000 tons will soon be reached. After October, the committee will be able to steadily increase the amount of coal allocated. According to the person in charge of the committee, the current supply of coal is sufficient for public utilities and transportation. There will be no shortage. The amount of coal allocated to factories and civilian use has also increased to 20,000 tons this month. If the allocation can be increased by another 40,000 tons after October, then the black market for coal can be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<h3>Paper Industry Temporarily Suspends Tea Parties, No Price Increases Allowed</h3>
<p>In order to promote the government's economic policies, the Paper Industry Association has not only temporarily suspended tea parties but also advised its members to sacrifice personal interests and substantially reduce sales prices. On the 17th, it convened a meeting of retail members to discuss methods for stabilizing prices. It was decided that paper prices should only be reduced and not increased, so as to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices as soon as possible. Retail prices are as follows: 8.5 million per ream for white newsprint, 4 million per ream for folio newsprint, and 7 million per ream for white glazed paper.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Market Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign-style tea market for this year's Ping Shui, Shunyuan, and other major brands saw a resurgence of interest from export companies, but the asking price was far different from the premium goods, leading to stagnant transactions. On the other hand, domestic tea, which has been selling continuously for days, remained active due to the insatiable demand from stores in this city and in Suzhou, Wuxi and other places. However, sellers, seeing the shrinking market inventory, have intensified their efforts to hold firm, gradually leading to an imbalance between supply and demand. The number of transactions has frequently declined, while prices have remained consistently high.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares' Buying Sentiment Sluggish; Small Caps Suddenly See Vigor</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yong Yarn situation in Hua shares was chaotic, with financial panic ultimately forcing prices down. However, amid rumors of large-denomination banknotes and personnel changes among important officials, small-cap stocks suddenly surged. Huaxin, Underwear, Liann, Xinya, and Commercial stocks hit their daily limits, while Yong Yarn recovered easily after falling.</p>

No. 54 and others absorbed spot Yong Yarn, and No. 322 and others continuously absorbed forward delivery. Rumors of the issuance of large-denomination banknotes spread again, gradually rising to a high price of 328 yuan for immediate delivery and 333 yuan for forward delivery. No. 32 and others unloaded at high prices, and Yong Yarn closed at 314 yuan and 331 yuan. Huaxin Cement's large accounts mobilized, soaring to 119 yuan, just short of the daily limit, and then slightly retraced. As a result, compared to the previous close for immediate delivery shares, Yong Yarn, Huafeng, Xinyi, Zhabei, Hengjian, Rongji, China Textile, and China Silk and Commercial were slightly lower.

The off-exchange interest rate was also reported high. Rumors of yarn and cloth embargoes spread. Guangzhou No. 202 and others vigorously sold existing Yong Yarn but were still hesitating to sell, but then the small-cap stock boom was fierce. Rumors of the resignation of senior officials from Zhongda, Underwear and Xinya by No. 84, Huaxin Tian No. 107, Xiaan by No. 88, and Commercial by No. 143 were all reported to hit the daily limit. Zhabei was vigorously bought by No. 157 and others, rising all the way and jumping to over 80 yuan. People's hearts saw good omens. No. 85 and others advanced to high prices of 327 yuan and 338 yuan, and No. 202 and others settled existing Yong Yarn. The close slightly retreated to 326 yuan and 336 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huaxin, Underwear, Lianan, Xinya, and Commercial stocks hit the daily limit for immediate delivery shares. Zhabei and Jinglun rose by 0.5%, Qinxing rose by 10%, China-France Cement, Hua, Rong, China Textile each rose by 0.5%, Datong new shares fell by 0.5%, Jingfu was slightly lower, and Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meya, Xinguang, Xinhua, Tongyi, China Silk and Matches rose slightly, and the rest were flat. For forward delivery shares, Dongxing rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly. For old stocks on the off-exchange market, bank stocks remained stable, and the rest rose and fell differently.</p>
<h3>Payment of Margin for Forward Delivery Still Handled According to Original Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The stock exchange previously submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding the provisions for the payment of margin for forward delivery, seeking a flexible solution. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed to the stock exchange yesterday, instructing it to continue handling the matter according to the original plan, that is, the margin for forward delivery will still be 50% cash.</p>

<p>Foreign shares fell sharply and weakened again yesterday due to the impact of tight money conditions on the black market for gold and currency. Eesa opened in the morning at 176,000 yuan, fell to a low of 172,000 yuan, and then recovered to 175,000 yuan at the close.

<h3>Request that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Provide Services for Elderly and Weak Passengers</h3>
<p>I absolutely agree with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's policy of not allowing people to see passengers off on board. Because whenever a ship is about to depart, the ship is extremely crowded, and the passage is congested, all due to too many people seeing passengers off. However, it seems somewhat inappropriate for the elderly and weak women and children to board the ship without anyone accompanying them. The last time I saw my mother and two children off to Ningbo, I was not allowed to board the ship because I did not have a ticket. But my mother is already seventy years old, and the children are only five or six years old. The high ladders cannot be climbed without someone's help, and arranging luggage on board also requires someone to take care of it. That day, I watched my mother take the two children up, trembling, while the passengers behind were pushing and shoving. I felt very uneasy, and I think many passengers feel the same way. I wonder if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has any way to improve services for elderly and weak passengers? I have always known your newspaper to be the voice of the people, with the widest circulation. Could you publish this openly so that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can pay attention and make corrections? This is submitted by Qian Chaozhen of Shenbao.

<h3>Continuing Dreams of Yangzhou, No. 23: Yangzhou Noodles and Dim Sum</h3>
<p>By Weifahong</p>
<p>Tea houses and restaurants in large cities often display the sign "Weiyang Fine Dim Sum," indicating the deliciousness of Yangzhou dim sum. In fact, apart from dim sum, the sliced noodles also seem to have a special flavor, so let's briefly discuss Yangzhou noodles and dim sum.</p>
<p>Yangzhou sliced noodles, people from northern Jiangsu think that they are not as thin as those from Dongtai. Dongtai noodles can be called silver thread noodles, but Yangzhou's braised noodles are also unmatched by Dongtai and other places. There are many kinds of braised noodles, mostly varying with the seasons, such as knife fish braised noodles, crab braised noodles, wild duck braised noodles, etc. In addition, there are general ones such as shrimp braised noodles and shredded chicken braised noodles. The beauty of these braised noodles lies in the freshness of the noodle soup, the softness and tenderness of the noodles, while avoiding the soup and noodles becoming mixed and unclear. In the past, Yi Bingshou served as the prefect of Yangzhou, and Yi Mansion Noodles were created by him. It is said that braised noodles were also created by Gao Tuo Weng, the owner of Xiyu Spring. Yi and Gao were both from Fujian, and it seems that the creation of braised noodles was influenced by Yi Mansion Noodles.</p>
<p>As for dim sum, there are even more exquisite ones. The Shufanglu discusses the various tea houses in Yangzhou, believing that "their dim sum each occupies a prominent position. Shuanghonglou sesame cakes took the lead, with sugar filling, meat filling, dried vegetable filling, and Chinese cabbage filling. Yixing Ding Si opened Guan Kaixun Fang Ji Fang, famous for their fermented steamed buns. Ermeixuan is famous for its soup-filled buns, Yulian is famous for its spring pancakes, Wenxingyuan is famous for its shaomai, called 'ghost hair', Pinlu is famous for its Huai dumplings, and Xiaofang is famous for its vegetable dumplings, each extremely prosperous." As times change, these many tea houses that "each occupied a prominent position" are no longer seen. I remember that when I was still young, I saw "Pinlu" on Nanmen Street, a small tea house that was neither in its old location nor famous for its Huai dumplings, but even this no longer exists now. In recent years, apart from Chen's sesame cakes, I think that Cuishao shaomai, thousand-layer oil cakes, honey cakes, and soup dumplings are all worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I have mentioned jade shaomai and thousand-layer oil cakes in my Sequel to Xiyu Spring. Honey cakes are purchased by the catty from tea food stores, and are often not made by themselves. This cake is known for its softness, sweetness, and refreshing taste. The so-called "honey" should represent "honey." From this, it can be inferred that honey oil cakes are honey cakes, but they are quite different from honey cakes in other parts of Jiangnan, so they have a different flavor. It is already difficult for others to imitate them to be soft and sweet, and it is even more difficult to find them refreshing.</p>
<p>Let's talk about soup dumplings, also known as soup-filled buns in the Shufanglu, which are different from those made in Zhenjiang or Huaian. Zhenjiang and Huaian are both famous for their soup dumplings, but Zhenjiang only makes two kinds of soup dumplings in a year: fresh meat and crab roe. Yangzhou has more varieties such as wild duck and bean sprouts. Those made in Huaian, compared to those in Yangzhou, seem to be inferior in taste, only they are twice as large, making them uniquely large.</p>
<p>Yangzhou noodles and dim sum are as delicious as described above, so Yangzhou people are happy to go to tea houses for breakfast. People say that Yangzhou people "wrap water in their skin in the morning," and the deliciousness of the noodles and dim sum is a great temptation in the formation of this "skin-wrapped water" habit. Even for me, when I live in a foreign land, I often think of my hometown's noodles and dim sum for breakfast, like Zhang Han who missed the perch soup and minced meat from his hometown. However, although Yangzhou noodles and dim sum are good, Yangzhou tea houses are no longer what they used to be. In the past, tea drinkers ordered very few noodles and dim sum, but drank a lot of tea. They thought that drinking tea should not be too far removed from elegance. If they ordered too many noodles and dim sum, to the point of leaving a mess of cups and plates, they would inevitably reveal a vulgar air. They seemed to abide by a creed, which is "a gentleman tastes flavors lightly." But nowadays, those who come and go to tea houses do not mind ordering a lot of noodles and dim sum. If they only order a little, the waiter will not serve them well, and they will feel embarrassed themselves. Therefore, those who are short of money or who admire elegance no longer frequent tea houses. Even when they return to their hometown, they are like the visiting Zhang Han, and still keep the noodles and dim sum of their hometown in their memories!</p>
<h3>Recollections in Cold Clouds</h3>
<p>By Shoujuan</p>
<p>It has been sixteen years since he passed away; August 31st was the anniversary of his death. His disciples, brother Yu Yifen, etc., specially chanted scriptures and held a memorial service at Jingtu Nunnery. Because I live in Wujin, I was not notified and did not go to participate in the sacrifice, but I felt ashamed to my old friend! I remember in 1915, Brother Han wrote a poem to advise his father against proclaiming himself emperor, titled "Mingfen": "The thin cotton barely withstands the cold, the uncertain clear weather is not clear until evening, the southward-returning geese drown the lonely moon, (Brother Han went south once) the eastward-going proud wind assaults nine cities; (referring to his father's involvement with Japan) time slips by and one fights for a moment, the sound of crickets urges dreams into the third watch; it is especially pitiful that there is much wind and rain at high places, do not reach the highest level of the building." The last two sentences subtly say that one cannot be an emperor. At that time, Congressman Sun Bolan based on this poem and declared opposition, saying that Xiangcheng's second son, Kewen, did not approve of the imperial system either, let alone others; finally, it triggered General Cai Songpo's Yunnan uprising, which overthrew Hongxian. My late friend, Brother Bi Yihong, once taxed this poem, which will surely have a place in history in the future; and Brother Han's disdain for the imperial prince shows the nobility of his character. Between 1920 and 1921, Brother Han came to Shanghai to work as a public official. I was concentrating on editing the later issues of "Saturday" Weekly. He gave me a letter, praising me greatly, saying that he was willing to be a friend with me. From then on, we became acquainted and had extremely close contact. Whenever there was a literary gathering, he would invite me to attend. All the antiques, cultural relics, ancient coins, stamps, etc. that he collected, he would let me stroke and admire them. Later, he became fond of Western ancient gold coins, and collected them extensively. Whenever he obtained one, he would discuss the Western characters on the gold coin with me. After two or three years, we had become close friends. Later, I edited and published "Bimonthly," "Violet," and "Violet Slices." Brother Han also helped me wholeheartedly. He was responsible for all the title slips used. He published famous works such as "Thirty Years of News and Travels," as well as countless other poems and essays. He wrote many poems specifically for me, and I now record one or two of them, such as the inscription on Violet Slices: "Still able to shed tears like pearls, the fragrance of violet has not moved away; the eyebrow marks of Wusong are still there, bitterly remembering the temples reflected in the blue waves." "Infinite love waves secretly communicate, violet slices are within inches; idle sorrow written into new lyrics, tears and ink are red as well." Inscription on the Violet Goddess Statue: "The goddess endlessly transforms into violet, the cloud carriage and star pendant fall into Jiangqian; in vain teaching oneself to flow immortal scenes from the stone, the ten red building dreams are already cold." "In the past, there was a wish to be mandarin ducks, snapping fingers, the hatred between the immortal and the mortal is long; the Luo River and Wushan are faintly visible, slightly remote dreams are already spiritually injured." Violet Goddess Praise: "Better than flowers, more round than the moon, fragrant, gentle, dream forever, a special sky of love. Holding a pearl in the right hand, waving tears in the left, may the goddess of flowers hold happiness and not fall." The elegance and refinement fully demonstrates his skill in poetry. Later, he returned to Tianjin and still often sent letters, and fondly remembered Jiangnan with a song: "The sound of the cuckoo is bitter, who shares my melancholy? I have long entrusted parables to convey my skills, now I record my travels from the small record. (At that time, Yu was traveling in Mogan Mountain, and there was a work of "Mountain Trivia," published in Shanghai newspapers and periodicals.) Dreaming of old violet thickets." Attached was a letter, saying that when we were in Shanghai, we were so compatible that we were like hands and feet, and he wished to become sworn brothers. He asked me for my approval. I was grateful and ashamed, and immediately wrote back agreeing. In 1932, Brother Han gave up his habits and lived a free life in Beijing and Tianjin. Unfortunately, he suffered from wool rash and died. When I received the bad news, I almost fainted from grief. Because I was involved in personnel matters, I was unable to go to offer condolences in person. I could only look north at Yanyun and break off from the world in the wind. Now he has been dead for sixteen years, and most of his posthumous works, apart from his diary, have been lost, which is truly a regrettable thing! Fortunately, his son, Zhong Yan Shuxuan, is studying in the New World and has achieved success, which can be used by the country; Brother Han's spirit should be smiling in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Three Chapters of Dawn</h3>
<p>— Cao Guoping</p>
<p>Morning Glory</p>
<p>Indeed, in this desolate garden, only the morning glories blooming wildly before dawn can be proud.</p>
<p>I see them smiling arrogantly, flaunting their beauty and despising the withered and faded flowers and plants nearby. They seem to be grateful that this harsh environment has given them a richer destiny.</p>
<p>Some branches bear pure white flowers, while others are a mix of purple and white. No one irrigates them, but no wild children come to break their branches and leaves. They live quietly and happily...</p>
<p>One day, I approached them, bending over to look at them. I suddenly noticed that these flowers were drooping their heads and sighing on the ground. I saw that the dew, which had always nourished their lives, had turned into the most bitter tears flowing from the depths of their hearts. These hot tears are a sign of the end of their lives, and a lament for their own death...</p>
<p>I seem to faintly hear their complaint; — "As soon as we see sunlight, our bodies will wither and decay, and the vitality of life will immediately disappear..."</p>
<p>I will always feel sorry for these flowers that can only live where there is no light—living a life of complacency and happiness. ...Because who can say that there will be no sun in the sky? That the earth will have no light again?</p>
<p>Seagull</p>
<p>Awake, the seagull on this beach, its body as white as a saint's dress. It flapped its wings, which had been curled up all night, and began to fly in the sky.</p>
<p>All around is silence. The fishing boats have not yet taken down their awnings, seeming to be comfortably letting the waves lick their bodies.</p>
<p>The seagull is soaring freely, sometimes riding the wind steadily forward, and sometimes flipping its wings to resist the wind and surge forward...</p>
<p>The seagull swoops down nimbly, urgently kissing the sea surface, reporting the news of dawn. Then, the vast sea shakes its calm body and opens its throat to sing the sound of roaring waves, praising the coming of light... The calm surface of the water is stirred, instantly becoming high hills and low mounds on the sea. It brings the vitality of life and marches forward with its responsibility.</p>
<p>The seagull busily but happily sings the morning song on top of every fishing boat. In an instant, the boats resting overnight by the shore raise their sails; the boatmen row their oars, making a sound of oars striking the water. The people on these boats, with great hope and full strength, begin their day's work.</p>
<p>The crashing sound of waves, the creaking of oars, and the loud songs weave together a welcome song. May the life of hope forever proceed in the song with happy days!</p>
<p>At the edge where the eastern sea meets the sky, a streak of red clouds appears.</p>
<p>Rising Sun</p>
<p>Finally, the rising sun, its fat face flushed red, struggled out of the embrace of the red clouds. The entire universe is illuminated and warmed.</p>
<p>Aren't the sweet songs sung by the little birds on the branches, the splashing sounds made by the fish in the water, and the spiritual songs in the hearts of mankind all praise for receiving its warmth and light?</p>
<p>Rising sun, I should thank you. Not a day goes by that you are willing to stop coming to the universe. From east to west, the fields and villages you pass through give the source of life—light and heat—. The wealthy in the garden have your warmth, and the beggars who have spent the night on the road can also enjoy your grace. You are not biased.</p>
<p>Rising sun, I praise you. Your ultimate love extends to all directions, and your pure love is sown in your own garden. The blood of your life personally pours into the bodies of us anemic people. You are the trunk of life, and you have stored rich nourishment to supply us branches that belong to you.</p>
<p>Rising sun, I will comfort you. Our branches will not waste the life you have given. We will bloom bright flowers and bear plump, sweet fruits. The nutrients in our branches—which you provide—will never be swallowed by aphids and caterpillars... We will do our best to preserve this indispensable vitality.</p>
<p>Rising sun, the sincere praise and gratitude of thousands of people is what you deserve, please accept it!</p>
<h3>Presented with a Painting Exhibition of Wu Lifu and a Verse from Su Shi</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>The more beautiful the mountains and rivers, the more tireless the mind becomes; the eyes exhaustedly follow the solitary wild goose on the edge of the setting sun. There is still a clear interest in the dream, and occasionally a poem is written without needing to be compiled.</p>
<p>Traveling ten thousand miles halfway across the world, with poetry and books in the belly, one's spirit naturally flourishes. Clouds and smoke fall on the paper after being drunk, and the north window startles my eyes with flying flowers.</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling that Mount Emei's emerald green has been swept away, the true form still exists in the painting. Directly use eyesight as the boundary, counting to which peak of the cloud peaks.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the universe are within a speck of dust, and everything is obtained with a wave of the hand. Not understanding how to pursue worldly favor with painting, I am like a brother when I meet you.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Originally, this kind of thing is born with a cunning heart, and with training, the main lesson is practical psychology, specializing in peeping into people's minds. First, give you many "sweeteners," while figuring out your goals, and then give you a big hope, hanging your appetite. You know it's not easy to deal with, but under the conditions of using a trick to counter a trick, you think it can be used and are unwilling to let go. Ji Qun is now facing such a thing—how do you think she should deal with it?</p>
<p>"What is your honorable surname, Mai?" Qun waited for it to stop, then broke her silence. "Oh, I'm really sorry, you were walking so hurriedly just now, I didn't hear it clearly, but your surname is Mai,—the Mai of barley?" Qun launched a surprise attack like a startled goose, using fleeting shadows.</p>
<p>"No," it smiled, showing that Yao Qun's opening was like its supreme glory: "Mai—the Mai of buying and selling."</p>
<p>"The Mai of trade?" Yao Qun's eyes moved, probably silently reciting "Zhao Qian Sun Li" to see if there was such an unpopular surname.</p>
<p>"You don't know," it understood Yao Qun's intentions, "this is not a Chinese surname."</p>
<p>"Then:" Yao Qun wanted to say "Then it must be a foreign surname?"</p>
<p>"But it's not a foreign surname either," it cracked open its thick lips again, "There's a tragedy inside." Speaking of the word tragedy, it sighed softly, as if it had stirred up endless feelings: "When my late mother was pregnant, she originally had two husbands, one surnamed Maikotorovskysky, and one surnamed Markosav. My late mother, in order to commemorate them both, gave me both surnames as soon as I was born, as legal heirs of both families. But because I went to a Chinese school in Harbin, the teacher said that the name was too cumbersome, so I cut off a large section in the middle, leaving only the head and tail as my name."</p>
<p>"Went to a Chinese school?" Jie Qun noted this point.</p>
<p>"Because my late mother was probably of Mongolian or "Manchu" nationality, she especially liked the Chinese language. That's why I went to a Chinese school. You know, my mother and I can speak four or five dialects besides Russian, including Japanese... But besides language, I like music the most, so I later specialized in music..." it promoted itself again.</p>
<p>"Vocal music? Or..." Yao Qun used the words to study its details.</p>
<p>"Alas, my old mother has a familiar voice, and my son can learn how to solidify it." It stretched out a pair of hands, "This pair of rakes, so I can't talk about musical instruments; I can only learn music theory and composition... Besides music, I am also fascinated by art. Although I can't do it myself, I can comment and research... In addition, Mongolian things, shooting, pride, wrestling, and fighting, can also be dealt with, but they are just tricks."</p>
<h3>Shixin Peak of Mount Huangshan (Oil Painting)</h3>

<h3>About Kawashima Yoshiko</h3>
<p>— Xia Xi</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Kawashima Yoshiko is a "rare object" in the history of the Sino-Japanese War. She used her charm and skills to engage in espionage work and participated in every conspiracy of Japanese aggression. She had lived all kinds of bizarre lives, as a princess and a commander-in-chief, and also as a dancer and a prostitute. And now, she is experiencing another environment—prison life. This may not be interesting to her, but in the hearts of thousands of Chinese people who have suffered, it should be satisfying enough. Didn't you see the record in the newspaper the day before yesterday? The public trial of Kawashima Yoshiko in Beiping almost broke the courtroom. Naturally, the mood of these observers, in addition to the pleasure of revenge, also carried a bit of curiosity. Curiosity is due to Kawashima Yoshiko's complicated and bizarre life.</p>
<p>Speaking of this "Far East Mata Hari," it's a long story. Everyone knows that she is the seventh daughter of Prince Su, originally a genuine Chinese product. After Prince Su committed suicide in Lushun due to the failure of his restoration, the Japanese ronin Naniwa Kawashima adopted her as his adopted daughter. According to Kawashima Yoshiko's autobiography: "My adoptive father is a well-known "China expert" in Japan. Through this relationship, I was able to meet some Japanese people and obtain the meaning of "Sino-Japanese friendship" from them. I have tried to integrate with their ideals and regard them as my motto, and even willingly dedicate myself to achieving them."</p>
<p>In fact, the first object of her "dedication" was her adoptive father. Later, there were some entanglements, and the father-daughter relationship was severed. Yoshiko lived a licentious life until the Black Dragon Society discovered her. She was transformed from a dissolute socialite into the current identity of a pro-Japanese traitor.</p>
<p>Kawashima Yoshiko was first given to Prince Baling of Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia as a tool of the Black Dragon Society. The Japanese wanted to use this relationship to occupy Inner Mongolia, which they had coveted for a long time, but Yoshiko couldn't get used to the desert life and secretly slipped back to Japan, making this "beauty scheme" finally fall short.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Yoshiko was sent to the Northeast and had a relationship with the Kwantung Army. Under the training of Doihara Kenji, she became a capable female spy. She often disguised herself as a female teacher or traveler to spy on military intelligence in the Northeast, and sometimes disguised herself as a Chinese or Korean prostitute, mingling in gambling dens and opium dens. She helped Doihara plan the Shenyang Incident and put Puyi on the throne. Four hundred female spies were once under her command. She also disguised herself as a Chinese student and was sent to Vladivostok to socialize with Soviet officials and spy on military secrets east of Lake Baikal, and even received a medal from the Japanese government for this.</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" battle, Kawashima went to Shanghai to work as a dancer, seducing Chinese military and political officials. The enemy army invaded Shanghai based on her intelligence. After the outbreak of the Rehe War, she actually organized an "army" and appeared as the Commander-in-Chief of Jin Bihui.</p>
<p>Since she was a child, she disguised herself as a man and chanted in middle school. In North China, she liked to wear a robe as a coat, silk boots, a melon-skin hat, and spoke fluent mandarin, completely in the style of a warlord, entering and leaving with guards and attendants, with great prestige.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this Commander Jin turned into General Wang, and sometimes into the dancer Wan Xianbai. After "August 3rd," she turned into a Chinese soldier and was active in the North Railway Station. Later, she turned into Li Songxiang and mixed with Chen Yaozu, the brother-in-law of the traitor Wang Jingwei, in Hong Kong. Finally, she returned to Beiping.</p>
<p>Her lovers can be said to encompass everything: warlords, Japanese ronin, barbershop owners, boxers, famous actors, and newspaper reporters. Wu Sheng Li Wanchun</p>
<p>The age of Kawashima Yoshiko is still a mystery: according to her testimony in court, she is thirty-five years old, according to the Beiping Chronicle, she is forty years old, according to the Shenbao reporter's interview, she is thirty-eight years old, and according to the household registration of the Third District, it is even more different. The household registration states: "Kawashima Yoshiko, Jin Bihui, forty-four years old, native of Manchuria, occupation Commander-in-Chief of the Manchurian National Corps." This was investigated in 1938, so calculating this year, she should be fifty-three years old.</p>
<p>It is said that her residence in Beiping was heavily guarded, such as raising twenty-nine military dogs and many monkeys, and two white chickens, specially trained to guard the door for her, but it was useless. On the first Double Tenth Festival after the victory, she was finally arrested in Beiping. In the courtroom, she was still "attacking east and west," sophistry, but the spy's tricks were ultimately not very useful in front of the judge! We are waiting for October 22, which will be the day to judge the crimes of Kawashima Yoshiko's life!</p>
<h3>The Third International</h3>
<p>— Broken Wheel</p>
<p>Recently, the Soviet Union has announced the establishment of a new Communist International, which is enough to be exciting news. Regarding the resurrection of the Third International, let us look back at a brief history of it.</p>
<p>The Communist International, also known as the Third International, is also called the Comintern, because it is centered on the Soviet Communist Party. The so-called Third International has gone through three evolutions; the life of the First International was only eight years; while the Second International only lived for twenty-five years. The First and Second Internationals were both led by Lenin. The Third International was also produced under the leadership of Lenin, but after several twists and turns, it was stillborn; after the success of the Soviet revolution, it was established in Moscow from March 2nd to 4th, 1919. Representatives from 34 countries participated, gradually increasing to 65 countries.</p>
<p>From the birth to the dissolution of the Third International, it can be roughly divided into five periods: The first period was from its establishment to 1923. This period was when the Soviet Communist Party was engaged in seizing power. Although four years of civil war enabled the Communist Party to gain state power, the radical war communism had not yet found a way out. Therefore, within the Soviet Union, a new economic policy was adopted. The second period was from 1924 to 1927. The political struggle between Stalin and Trotsky was very fierce. Although both of them advocated world revolution, Stalin advocated slow progress, while Trotsky advocated rapid progress; as a result, Trotsky failed. The third period was from 1927 to 1935. The Soviet Union buried itself in domestic economic construction, and the so-called world revolution was temporarily suspended. Because the countries participating in the Communist International were in fact equivalent to vassals of Moscow, they also formulated their own party programs. The fourth period was from 1935 to 1938. At that time, the Nazi and Fascist forces were extremely consolidated, and the Communist International adopted a people's front policy to counter them, but without success. The fifth period began at the beginning of the Second World War in 1939. Because of the Soviet Union's treaty with Germany, the international nature of the Communist Party gradually shrank. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union and stood on the Allied side, the Third International organization was formally dissolved on May 22, 1943.</p>
<p>But in the two years after the Allied forces defeated the Axis powers, the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union became increasingly clear, and the gulf dividing the entire world into two became increasingly deep. The establishment of a new Communist International has dragged the earth closer to the brink of war!</p>
<h3>Two or Three Things About Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>On the last day of the Yalta Conference, everyone had free time to socialize and rest. A British attendant chatted with Roosevelt and asked him: "Mr. President, how old are you this year?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt replied: "According to the calendar, I am sixty-two years old this year, but when I have work to do, I am thirty-five years old."</p>
<p>A White House visitor asked: "Mr. President, how do you get so much patience—encountering so many troubles and uninvited guests in a day?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt replied indifferently: "When you spend two years learning how to wiggle your big toe, you will have patience."</p>
<h3>Conversation Between Sun Yu and Li Lili — A Record of the "Made in China" Welcome Tea Party</h3>
<p>— Gong Wang</p>
<p>At the "Made in China" studio in Jin Situ Temple, a tea party was held, which, although not grand, was quite</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yu raised the issue of "cooperation." He said: "...Film production in the United States is quite complicated and is based on a division of labor. Even a very small matter has a dedicated person in charge of managing it. If a small part of the work is selected poorly or delayed, it will affect the entire work..." He also said: "...Except that the United States has better scientific and technological equipment than us, their artistic level and spirit of hard work are not necessarily stronger than ours..." Mr. Sun's first question should alert our domestic film workers, and the latter words give us great comfort and encouragement.</p>
<p>In today's environment of poor material conditions and scarcity of film and equipment, if our film workers are still selfish, then we can only let this career, which has been struggling for more than twenty years, go down the drain.</p>
<p>Miss Li Lili is much slimmer than she was during the military parade. She said that she lost weight in the United States by not eating butter and milk, because in the United States, a fat girl will be considered "stupid." The United States is a country that loves beauty, especially girls, perhaps because of the abundance of butter and bread.</p>
<p>Miss Li said: No matter what in the United States, as long as a movie is a hit or a play is the most popular, then the director and actors of that movie or play are the most popular and best directors and actors. I believe we will never agree to this kind of system.</p>
<p>Miss Li talked a lot about her learning experiences in the United States and the jokes she shared with Mr. Sun Yu. But I have to raise a matter that deserves attention: that is, Americans do not understand China very well and often distort things. For example, they believe that the Cantonese films produced in Guangzhou a long time ago represent the Chinese film industry, and some even think it is surprising that China has movies.</p>
<p>Once, an American company asked Miss Li to star in a film for six weeks, with a remuneration of 26,000 US dollars. The subject matter of the script was about how a Chinese girl defrauded foreigners in an exchange and killed a foreigner and ran away. Miss Li resolutely refused because it contained places that insulted the Chinese people. This is quite commendable.</p>
<p>Miss Li also proposed striving for the foreign film market to exchange for foreign exchange, which is a very worthy issue to study. But I think that today, we should first consolidate ourselves, stabilize ourselves, and then strive for the foreign market. What we need today is everyone's sincere cooperation to strengthen our strength and consolidate the foundation of our career.</p>
<h3>The Next World War</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>In the process of the Second World War, mankind also repeatedly felt the preciousness of world peace. The late President Roosevelt of the United States, who led the Allied countries in the war, put forward the great slogans and plans of the Four Freedoms and the United Nations, drawing a beautiful vision of a peaceful post-war world for mankind who were still immersed in the war. However, even in the middle of the Second World War, many sensitive human beings were discussing the matter of the Third World War. As William C. Bullitt, the former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, said in the preface to his book The Great Globe Itself:</p>
<p>"In August 1944, on the eve of the Allied French forces attacking southern France, the generals gathered in General Petiot's restaurant. What they were talking about was not the current war, but the next world war. They all knew that the major powers at the time were studying how to use atomic energy for war, so they anticipated that the future war would be a contest between rockets loaded with atomic bombs and jet-powered aircraft."</p>
<p>So, "General Petiot ended the conversation with a wonderful metaphor. He said: "Do you want to ask about the outcome of the next world war? I think the human race will be completely destroyed by atomic bombs in this war. In the end, only two planes and two aviators will be left. They will pursue each other around the earth again. When they fly over Africa, the fuel will suddenly run out, causing them to fall and perish in the jungle one after another. At that time, an old gorilla squatting on the edge of the tree, seeing this scene, repeatedly shrugged its shoulders and said to its mate: Look, they are all finished, you and I have to start all over again."</p>
<p>Although this is full of humorous satire, it can be seen that the first atomic bomb did come to Hiroshima, Japan, and the second bomb came to Nagasaki, prompting Japan to surrender and shortening the end of World War II. The power of the atomic bomb is just as General Petiot and the other generals imagined. If used without restriction, mankind will be completely destroyed. Unfortunately, reality is too cold and ruthless, and the world situation after the war has become a "replica" of the pre-war situation; "atomic bombs" have also become a shadow on the fate of mankind, and people are enthusiastically discussing when the Third World War will occur.</p>
