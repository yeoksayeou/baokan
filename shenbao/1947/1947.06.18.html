<h3>北方行紀之三　風沙懷仁堂</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>圖為北平王府井大街</p>
<p>風沙帶來迷　，長城也未能阻止這個侵裝，我們南方人，是頗不慣於這種滿天滿地的困擾的。此刻，它更象徵着混沌，糾纏不淸。</p>
<p>平津鐵路綫三日兩日中斷，通縣似乎是張浮在海上的萍，西苑飛機塲的一個警衛排長指着那遠遠的山後對我說，三十里外就有小股出沒，今年廢曆四月十八日的妙峯山香會，連善男信女都不敢向神致虔敬之意了。</p>
<p>北平人都很泰然，大家雖知道似乎身處籠城中，正像他們生活在風沙中已習慣一樣。</p>
<p>我到北平是學潮最高潮的時候，這個具有學生運動光榮傳統歷史的學生城，誰都不敢預料它將發生什麽事故，但結果，是出乎想像之外的滿意，三個星期的連亙動亂中，祇是幾件小衝突而已。北平的學生為全國冠，北平學生在這次風潮中所表現的種種，更不比各地的不激烈，人們也許要問造成這個滿意的結果的，是誰？在北平的人，誰都可以答復你，是李宗仁將軍和他的幕僚長王鴻韶。這是一個社會的公正的論斷。我不敢假定，似定李宗仁將軍不是負奮當局，那個局面的演變將如何，因為這個似定是多餘而浪費的。</p>
<p>學生畢竟是學生，李宗仁將軍在徐州會戰時統帥三軍，叱咤風雲，懂得作戰，懂得指揮部隊；現在，他也懂得現實政治，他並未將學生和士兵同樣看待。他宅心仁厚，以寬容來應用情與理，結果自然能臻致自慰與慰人的境界。</p>
<p>有個風沙日子，我和朋友到到中南海行轅去拜訪他，我說，舊小說中往往提供人名與地名因緣巧合的故事，中南海有居仁堂·懷仁堂，現在却是行轅主任的辦公處所，怕為李氏當初始料所不及罷。</p>
<p>學潮最緊張的那一段日子裏，胡適·陸志葦·李蒸等是懷仁堂座上的常客，李氏不僅以誠懇的能度博得大學校長們的衷心合作，目以具體行動支持大學校長們的意見。　然而，這座遼闊寂靜的園林，使李德鄰將軍不無有國鬱之感。他有他的心曲，也許懷仁堂前　　的水可以潺溝地　他流鳴罷！</p>
<p>市長何思源，也是懷仁堂座上的常客他。到任不及一年，就我所知，最大的一件功績，是淸除市區穢土（垃圾）工作了。據報告，北平十餘年所積存的穢土，在兩個月零十三天中，完全淸除完畢，計淸除穢土二百一十萬零九百七十三噸，每天動員平均為十八萬八千二百餘人，共動員汽車五千五百四十輛，手車四千三一百十五輛，電車四百廿輛，火車六十八節，經費共用去十一億二千餘萬元，十餘年積穢；一且淸除，使北平市面目一新，更能顯出這個園林化都市的無媚來。</p>
<p>據說，何思源先生曾以平民市長自期，但有人說他很會做官，今日的中國社會，提到「官」之一字，幾乎就是代表罪惡，這個流行觀念最危險，可以毀滅一切。在這種空氣之下，誰都畏怯而潔身自好起來。在道種空氣之下，好的人民公僕甚至被大家抹煞。官有官的職守，會做官，最低限度是不能背棄他的職守的。所以會做官不應該認為是一件壞事。一個人想好，力求衆譽，至少動機不惡，社會應該不惜給于鼓勵。因為獎勵人為善，消極的意義就是貶責惡人。</p>
<p>何思源先生心直口快，是個豪爽人，他在中山公園滿族文化促進會成立大會上的一篇演講辭，是噲炙故都人士之口的，特別滿族同胞感到滿意。不過有的時候，心性未免躁急一點。有一次，他召集商會，工會。農會及听屬各單位代表訓話，當中有一段，他說：</p>
<p>現在大家都在駡所謂：「是官皆責」，但貪也得有個機會呀！而且報紙上也在大罵貪汚，這正像一個人，天天光是看自己茅房奧，廚房不乾净，覺得心煩。如果有客來，把他讓到客廳裏坐坐，他所看到的，不也是一樣的漂亮嗎？所以我們最好要　客應，不必專看厠所·廚房。</p>
<p>因之便有人提出一個「客　政治論」的口號來。</p>
<p>這倆華北重鎭歷代帝都，裏面上是安謐的，其範圍也僅限於距城三十里，即在城內和平寗靜的空氣中，也可以時時嗅到身邊的火藥氣。有一天，報紙社會欄出現如下的一則新聞：</p>
<p>王府井大街南口一三七號一瑞士商人之公寓內，住有一妙齡女郎，室內設備富麗堂皇，舉止亦極闊綽，旅店樂戶檢查督導組接獲密報，謂該女郎係一日本人，或係担任諜報工作者，當派王陳二組長前往檢查。該女郎操流利國語，自稱名楊惠明，前在軍調部為美方担任　譯，並曾在長春前進指揮所服務，原籍係福建人，惟再詢問伊之母嫂，均只能以日本式華語答話，遂將母女三人，一併解送稽查處訊辦。</p>
<p>北平在迷離中。</p>
<p>風沙是大自然的產物、朋友說，秋冬的聲勢更驚人，我希望人事別以它為象徵，保持北方山川風土人物所具有的質樸，單純，恢宏，於安定中求進步，然而這僅是一種願望而已。</p>
<p>籠城，又何能修談政情！</p>

<h3>遠東經濟會議第二日　各國代表分別致詞　菲代表被推選為副主席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議，昨為第二日，上午十時半開會，按照議程，應討論第四項推選大會副主席。但以蘇聯代表史迭辛柯。於前日會中再三提議該項選舉應在各國代表發表演詞後舉行，故昨晨美代表戴維斯即建議將議程第五項「決定臨時議程」先第四項而討論，其中包括各國代表如頗意者，可發表關於各該國經濟調查報告之簡短演詞。此案經蘇聯代表附議，由大會通過後，即由主席蔣廷　提請印度代表首先致詞。但印代表奈魯以並未準備，故要求下午發表。</p>
<p>次即由英代表克羅爵士致詞，繼為遷羅，法國，澳洲等國代表發表演詞後，上午會議即散。</p>
<p>下午三時繼續由印，美，蘇聯，中國，荷蘭，菲列賓等代表致詞。至此，十國代表演詞均告完畢，開始推選副主席。法代表摩爾諾首先提名菲代表瓜德諾，渠並稱：瓜氏才學經騐均豐富，適於副主席之資格，渠不僅係一律師，且為一財政家，歷任菲列賓國家銀行副經理等職，現為菲財政部長。此案即經　代表附議，但蘇代表史迭辛柯又表示其異議　：，本人已說明在先，蘇聯代表團抵滬發遲，對於副主席人選亦無充分時間考慮。據太人所知，副主席人選在大會未開幕前，業經其他各國代表在會外議決，但本國代表並未參加，故本人不受此項決議之限制，故應另再提名。此外，副主席之資格應予考慮，除法代表所說之經濟上之資格外，尚應注意地理上等之關係·但現在其他代代旣已決定不同意見，蘇代表對此亦祇能表示緘默。</p>
<p>綫由　維斯提議停止討論，主席即宣布菲代表瓜德諾為大會副主席。瓜氏隨即起立表示感謝，並代表菲國致謝意。</p>
<p>大會於五時散會。今晨會議仍定十時半舉行。</p>
<p>又該會研究及審查臨時議事規則小組委員會，於昨日下午二時半。在華懋飯店八樓休息室舉行會議。</p>
<p>茲將各國代表演詞分錄如下：</p>
<p>英代表</p>
<p>克　致詞略謂：本會的組織尚須逐步　展，在開飴工作時不宜使任務過　。目前主要之事務，仍在交換情，以值各種方案能有確切之根。本人希望各國能開誠佈公，互相供給兩報，同時各國代表皆能確守範圍，而不覓取無關之情報。羅氏並稱：此次本會在滬開會，意義甚深，中國及上海在戰時皆蒙極大損失，今日在此討論復興計劃，誠為適宜之表示。</p>
<p>暹代表</p>
<p>阿塞于克梯致詞稱：暹羅當局深望　與本會取得密切聯絡，以求改進暹羅之經濟情况。自日人佔領暹羅後，數年之間，遭受極度之破壞，現交通，工業，農業均需謀求復原，而困難甚多。吾人雖處於種種困難之下，但仍願負起亞洲經濟重建之一部分責任，盡其最大努力，與各國取得密切之聯絲。</p>
<p>法代表</p>
<p>摩爾諾致詞，表示代表法國代表團感謝中國政府能予聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議在華舉行。並表示法代表團對於此會議之主要工作研究及調查工作，決盡最大力量予以合作。</p>
<p>澳代表</p>
<p>吳頓（副代表）演說謂：本委員會任務之一，為謀取久遠之經濟合作方案，以便向經濟理事會提出具體之建議。吳氏又稱：各國經濟之合作，不必有一固定之方案，在國營及商營之兩種方式下，希望能有各種類似之辦法。本委員會在研究此等方案時，不應以政治理論之見解為決定之原則。</p>
<p>印代表</p>
<p>磜魯致詞謂：在欲建立亞洲及遠東之經濟新基礎，首先值得吾人注意者，厥為推動國際間之合作，實現眞正之民主自由與平等，此種責任實應由聯合國勞力完成。亞洲及遠東各國之政治背景，雖有不同，但重建經濟基礎改進人民生活之目標則一。此次大會，吾人於研究各報告及提案後，應求得一完善之經濟設計劃，以備聯合國採納施行。</p>
<p>美代表</p>
<p>戴維斯致詞略稱：美代表團有三點主張：（一）大會應首先綜合各小組之工作報告，作詳細之研究。（二）制定重建亞洲及遠東經濟基礎之辦法。（三）分別研究各國之需要，注重實際工作。渠最後又稱：吾人既深信經濟重建之重要，自更不可忽略交通之改進，以及糧食增產，國際貿易等諸問題，蓋於經濟之改善，均有莫大之影響也。</p>
<p>蘇代表</p>
<p>史迭辛柯演詞中，對蘇聯立塲有確切之聲明。其要點如下：（一）本會為貫澈聯合國機構之基本信條，必需尊重各該國家之主權，絕對不干涉各國之內戰，而尤須依照聯合國經濟社會理事會之決議，在未得有關國家之允許前，對各該國家不取任何行動。（二）本會尤需密切注意各國給予友幫之協助，無敢治作用，而不以協助作為政治上之壓力。（三）蘇聯一方面將盡力協助其他國家復興，同時更將貫澈其社會主義之經濟組織及其五年計劃。（四）在爭取和平復興之工作中，主要之對象為使反動勢力及法西斯主義無再造成戰爭之機會。（五）本會之任務係協助物資豐富國家發展其生產力而達到渠等經濟獨立之目的，同時本會亦得協助此等國家政治民族上之獨立。</p>
<h3>提高婦女地位　努力平等工作　聯合國婦女委會發表宣言</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次遠東經濟委會大會，曾接獲聯合國提高婦女地位委會發表之宣言，此項宣言係由聯合國經濟委員會十五位婦女代表所提出，每一婦女委員代表一們不同的國家，要求婦女在政治，經濟，民政，社交，教育各部門上均能獲得平等，以及生活之改進。宣言略稱：自進入二十世紀以來，提高女權，已為各方所注意及重視，今日各國對於謀求男女平權，地位相等之運動，已日有推進，在某數國之婦女且已獲得政治，經濟，人權上與男性相等之權利，但在甚多國家中婦女仍未謀得解放與平等，而提高女權遝動之工作亦進行不力，為達到提高婦女地位之目的，聯合國特呼籲全世界各國努力於男女平等之工作。</p>
<h3>我需要安定生活　李榦述中國人民之希望</h3>
<p>我國副代表李　致詞稱：本人在未發表主要文詞前，願先聲明數點，即中國代表團之意見，可謂與其他各國代表所述者完全一致。澳·美二代表所提議本會工作之範疇，本代表團甚為贊同，蘇代表提出工作之原則，亦為中國代表團所欲建議者。</p>
<p>此外，中國代表團蔣廷黻博士此次被推選為大會正主席，本代表團不勝榮幸，但中國代表團失去一位眞正能代表人民說話之代表，本人乃不得不代蔣博士稍抒意見。</p>
<p>本人欲向各位報告者，乃中國人民之希望。回溯日本侵略亞洲，即以中國為鵠的，此後雖曾侵略南洋及其他各國但其所闢戰塲，均以中國為中心。根據調查結果，中國因戰爭而死亡之軍民，約計一千二百十萬人，損毀城市四百三十九處，其中四十三處幾全部毀滅，公私財產損失者約達五百八十五美元，由此可表明中國因戰事而遭受損失之重大，經濟破壞程度更不堪設想，戰後之經濟仍困難重重。勝利迄今，雖將及兩年，但在最近數年內，復原殊非易事，中國及其他各國同樣發生通貨膨漲情形，因而引起政治，社會之不安定。</p>
<p>今日中國人民所量需要者，厥為安定生活，與夫增加生產，希望聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議能制定方案，協助中國自力更生，促進生產，使達到「生活進步」之簡單目標。</p>
<p>為達此目標，必須（一）生產須有合理組織，（二）貨物須有合理流通與分配。為此，中國代表特建議下列數點：（一）增加農產品，尤以糧食生產為主，並與國際糧食機構合作，以免多設機構。（二）推進平衡的工業生產制度，以達到合理程序。（三）改進交通事業，（四）推進遠東及全世界之國際貿易。</p>
<p>主席於昨日（即前日）致詞時，曾謂：政治能否澄淸，社會能否安定，一切均繫於經濟。規社會旣不安定，則更反映經濟建設之重要，故中國極希望大會能貢　寶貴意見，並予協助。</p>
<p>荷代表</p>
<p>史太京稱：此次會議能在上海舉行，本人感到十分欣慰，因中國在戰爭期問遭到極大苦難。藥又謂：荷蘭及印度尼西亞在戰時亦受到重大破壞，荷蘭國內之建設，需要外界之協助殊多。本人熟誠希望本會議能決定一建設經濟之計劃及辦法。</p>
<p>菲代表</p>
<p>瓜德諾致詞略稱：各國代表發表意見已甚多，本人均表贊同，故不擬贅述。但本人可保證菲列賓共和國均能予本會最大之合作。渠並希望在短時期內，菲代表團能在太會議所規定議事範圍提出關於研究之議案，供大會討論。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十六日電〕中國方面所傳，根據臨時辦法之百分卅之優先賠償品，重達三百五十萬噸，頃據中國賠償代表李德琛稱：此一數字係過甚其辭，臨時賠償之總噸數已數度修改，第一次規定為去歲九月，計一千二百萬噸，十一月則減至五百五十萬噸，一月之前，總部賠償執行處復現定為五百廿萬噸，臨時辦法之百分之卅優先賠償，以噸數計，共計一百五十六萬噸，而非如所傳之三百五十萬噸。中國獲得優先賠償之半，計七十八萬噸，而非一百七十五萬噸。關於賠償之範圍，將由遠東委會決走，其中包括十三種工業，一千餘家工廠。遷運賠償工作延誤之主要原　為：（一）蘇　自中國東北移去少機器設備，應視為賠償，但蘇聯堅持為勝利品，故意見衝突。（二）賠償額比率難以決定。</p>

<p>華萊士正在美蘇關係緊張的時候，發表這一個主張，無論那一個角度去觀察，都有值得加以研究的價值。我們認為戰後世界問題的核心，端在美蘇關係的逆轉，盟國贏得了勝利，但締造不成功和平，其唯一的癥結，就是在美蘇兩國之間，匪特不能精誠合作，共同致力於世界和平的締造；反而互相猜忌，處處站在對立的地位。莫斯科四國外長會議的不歡而散，實為美蘇衝突達於頂點的表面化，使人人相信，美蘇關係若無好轉的希望，則戰後的世界卽無和平可言。所以全世界愛好和平的人們，　不竭誠盼望　美蘇兩國的政治家運用其政治知慧，從　泯滅兩國間所有一切誤會與猜忌，而能開誠合作，共同致力於世界和平的締造，以達成聯合國機構所憧憬的崇高理想。但是觀於美蘇兩國於戰後所有的言行不難證明美蘇兩國分道揚鑣，背道而馳，愈走愈遠了。美國前國務副卿艾契遜於十五日向密特爾頓大學學生發表演說，譴靑蘇聯採取違背國際諒解與世界復與的政策，並指出蘇聯妨害世界和平的具體事實：（一）在遠東方面：蘇聯搬走中國東北九省之工業設備，保持其對於大連港之控制，並反對朝鮮之統一。（二）在中東方面，蘇聯煽動亞塞爾拜然省北部脫離伊朗本國，並鼓勵希臘之鄰國支持希臘共產黨武裝反抗希臘政府。（三）在巴爾幹方面匈牙利適於和約實施之際，突然發生政變，蘇聯應負全部責任。（四）在德奧方面，蘇聯不惜違背波茨坦協定，一味阻撓德國經濟之統一，並千方百計，阻礙對奧和約之起草工作之進行。艾契遜的這一番話，當可目為美國人民不滿意於蘇聯的原因。此在蘇聯方面，對於美國政府的言行，也有許多不能滿意的地方，蘇聯報章雜誌以及廣播電台，常常發表攻擊美國現行政策的言論，綜合起、也有下列各項：（一）美國保持原子能之秘密，不肯完全公開，實懷有以原子能威脅他國之意向使蘇聯　感不安：（二）美國在戰後　舊要保持其遍及全世界各處的軍略基地不啻有控制全世界的帝國主義者之野心；（三）美國運用金元外交　干涉歐亞各國之內政；尤其是援助希十兩國完全針對蘇聯　發；（四）杜魯門主義顯有防共反蘇之意向，當為蘇聯所不能容忍：（五）美國對於戰敗國採取寬大政策　尤為蘇聯所極端反對。認為美國不啻採取扶助德日的政策。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國之間的猜疑，不僅愈演愈深，而且戰後世界的分製而為兩個世界，也日益分明，前任美國總統統胡佛，甚至主張美國將蘇聯摒棄門外，單獨與德日締結和約，這種趨於極端的主張，雖未為美國外交當局所採納，但是美國輿論界却非常重視。美國人民的普遍心理，也就可見一斑了。不過世人只要訴諸常識與良心，就莫不明瞭戰後世界局勢的嚴重性；如果不設法挽回美蘇間的逆流，則不僅世界無和平可言，而且人類走向新的戰爭，一天近似「天了。這並不是我們故意危言聳聽，而是由於我們正視現實所獲得的確切感覺。美國務卿馬歇爾最近所提出的歐洲經濟合作的計劃，其最惹人注目的特色，不是美國繼續援助歐洲戰災各國，以免其社會經濟陷於崩潰的境地；而是將蘇聯亦包括在歐洲經濟合作的範圍之內，從而冲淡美蘇兩國人民的情緒。所以這個計劃，從遠處看，實有非常重大的意義；誠如共和黨總統候選人史泰森所謂：『世界大戰及經濟恐慌能否避免，將來視美國所採取之世界經濟政策而定。』</p>
<p>國際間發生猜疑，固然是多方面所造成的；就是猜疑的消除，也要靠多方面的共同努力：今日的美國外交當局，雖有改善美蘇關係的意向，但是這一個良計善策能否奏效？當須視對方能否接受而定。英國外相貝文昨已飛往巴黎，與法國當局共商歐洲經濟合作計劃；同時外界也有蘇聯外長莫洛托夫赴法訪間的傳說，但是要蘇聯也能贊同美國的計劃，希望是非常渺茫的，因為這幾天來的莫斯科廣播電台，不是抨擊馬歇爾國務卿推行杜魯門主義，就是駁斥美國的計畫，企圖以美元壓迫其他各國。所以在目前，蘇聯政治家若不能反躬自省，徹底覺悟，而要使美蘇之間化戾氣為鮮和，似乎是一件不可能的事情，華萊士的主張，聽來雖然非常動人，但終究是一個不合現實的美麗幻想！</p>

<h3>英外相飛抵巴黎　與法外長舉行初步會商　美援歐計劃為談判重心</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十七日電〕英外長貝文與法外長皮杜爾今日舉行柯次「試探性質」談判，以響　法國務卿馬歇爾援助歐洲經濟復興方案。同時，法國促請歐洲各國參加特殊化國際委員會，俾與美國合作擬訂統然援助程序。但法國拒絕召開歐洲經濟大會辦法，認為此舉過於複雜，且費時太多。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕外相貝文與經濟專家零爾，司蒂文斯與華爾莢等十三人今日午後乘機飛巴黎，與法方當局商討實施馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃之具體步驟。在貝文上飛機前，記考詢及在目前蘇聯旣表示不參加該項計劃，追對談判之結果是否表示樂觀。貝文答稱：「余一生從未有此種樂觀，余當沉着以赴，結果固難逆料也」。渠又轉向照相師微笑稱：一不要多費軟片」。外交部又提出警告稱：英法談判乃「試探」性質，切不可望其有迅遠之協議。然倫敦方面僉信十八日晚即可望有關於談判結果之聯合公報發表。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕貝文外相定今晚在英大使館　宴法總理賴瑪迪，外長皮杜爾及兩國經濟專家。關於馬卿計劃之討論，席間即將開始。貝文將於星期三晚或星期四晨返倫敦，參加週四之下院外交辯論，屆時或可報告巴黎會談之經過情形。英法專家交換意見之方式，明晚可由賴瑪迪，皮杜爾及貝文決定。自星期三起，技術性的討論即可在兩國外長決定之範圍內展開。又據本社日內瓦來電稱：聯合國歐洲經濟委員會之人士深盼該會得協助執行馬歇爾之援歐計劃，然其援助範圍猶須視東歐國家之態度而定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十六日電〕法國出席聯合國會議代表亞爾芬頃向報界談稱：法國已向美國提議在歐洲設立各以濟委員會，以便決定歐州之經濟需要及美國所將供應之物資。關於法國就履行馬歇爾經濟援助歐洲計劃所提出之建議，亦已訓令駐美大使廠萊於上週六送交美國務院。亞氏稱；各國尚不自行勞力，歐洲即不能復原，此種努力決非外來之援助所能替而代之。法國今所建議之歐洲各經濟委員會，應由（一）歐洲生產各國代表及（二）「　　國」之美國代表組成之，其任務有二，即（一）為恢復歐洲之生產力，首需調整歐洲所急切需要之　備，研究歐洲各國互相供應之力量，然後可以確定所需美國予以援助之數量；（二）在歐洲恢復生產前之「休養時期」內，亦應定一歐洲所能生產消耗品之數量，不足之數，然後求諸美國。</p>
<h3>法請莫洛托夫前來巴黎　蘇政府猶未答覆</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕莫斯科之「眞理報」雖於今日押擎馬歇爾國務卿之援助歐洲計劃為「美元協助下的政治壓力」，然法國人士對英法兩國外長定於星期二在巴黎開始以討論執行馬卿計劃之談話則均表示樂觀。據法外交部今日宣稱：法政府接獲貝文外相來巴黎之建議，即致牒莫斯科探詢蘇聯政府是否願與英法外長就馬卿之計劃交換意見，如　意，即請莫洛托夫來巴黎參加會談，但蘇聯政府至今猶未答覆。英國政府前亦會向蘇聯政府徵求響應馬卿計劃之意見，然就「眞理報」今日之言論觀之，英政府此項嘗試必歸於失敗無疑。蘇聯對馬卿計劃之反響，關係甚為重大。蘇聯如準備參加，則歐洲經濟合作之外貌常達戰爭結束以來最光明的程度，蘇聯若予拒絕，則東西之裂痕必致更見擴大。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十六日電〕法外部發言人頃宣稱：所傳蘇聯外長莫浴托夫將前來巴黎之說，外交部並無所聞云。</p>
<h3>美國經濟政策　為世界安危決定因素　史泰遜贊成馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社本雪爾凡尼亞州斯瓦斯摩爾城十六日電〕美國共和黨總統候選人史泰森本日向斯瓦斯歷爾大學學生發表演說稱：避免世界大戰與經濟恐慌之機會，端賴美國之世界經濟政策而定。國務卿馬歇爾元帥最近在哈佛大學所發表之意見，主張歐洲各闕在美國協助之下，實行經濟合作，余對此完全表示贊同。美國在今後十年或更長之時期內，應以大量援助界予歐洲戰災各國，以保障和平。美國可在若干地區立即採取行動，母需等待歐洲各國間舉行經濟洽商。歐洲各國需要魯爾區之煤斤方殷，祗需英美兩國成立協定，此一問題即可獲得解決。美國對於英國之缺少美元問題，亦應立即加以注意云。</p>
<h3>世界銀行贊成　歐與計劃</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處魁北克十六日電〕國際　設開發銀行主席麥克科羅埃本晚稱：該行「匪特準備抑且亟望在權力範圍內與任何發展歐洲之積極性全盤經濟計劃，通力合作。」按麥氏係在此間紐約州銀行家聯合會本年常會上發表演說。渠指陳稱世界銀行之職責，在於創造與開發會員國之生產工具，着重於借款之是否健全合理，及其生產之性質為何。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾出醫院</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕邱吉爾最近因疝氣入醫院施行手術，今日已痊愈出院，返海德園私邸。</p>
<h3>賴瑪迪接見　美駐法大使</h3>
<p>討論馬歇爾援歐計劃</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十六日電〕頃自可靠方面探息；賴瑪迪總理今晨接見美國大使卡弗萊，進行會談，曾論及馬歇爾之經濟援助隊洲計劃，尤其是法國經濟需要一事。此外，英外相貝文將至巴黎與法外長比杜爾進行會談一節，亦會討論及之。</p>
<h3>越盟向法要求　正式承認獨立</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢十七日電〕魁盟電台今日濱播越南國民議會常務委員會主席之聲明，表示在若干條件下，可在法關西聯邦機稱之內與法國合作，其條件為：（一）正式承認楚南之獨立；（二）北中圻與南圻之統一，（三）越南有權受法關西聯　全的一員之待遇。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統否決　減低所得稅法案　該案將由參衆兩院覆議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統業於本日否決共和黨所提所得稅减低四十億美元一項法案，其理由認為此舉，足以增加通貨膨脹之壓力。不料衆院殆將廢止其否決，但參院則將予以支持。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕業經國會通過核减英國內捐稅年約四億元之稅則法案，已於今日由杜魯門總統行使否決機。自共和黨控制國會以來，總統之否決國會通過之法案，尚屬第一次。總統指資該案犧牲究善之捐稅政策，而供獻冒險而不穩定的利益。就政府之財政觀點論，頗覺不安全，此乃總統與國會之第一次大衝突，國會當於明日覆議該案。依憲法規定，被總統否決之案，須得兩院三分之二多數之通過，始能維持原案。共和黨是否能於覆議時獲得兩院三分之二多數之贊成維持原案，尚難斷定。</p>
<h3>美衆院通過　羊毛進口增稅案</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕羊毛法案連同提高羊毛進口稅之款，已於今日經衆院通過。政府方面領袖其先曾發出警告，表示若核准提高羊毛進口稅，或限制外國羊毛之進口數量，將妨礙日內瓦貿易大會之成功，並有礙美國外交及經濟政策之順利執行。該案可於今日下午呈請總統簽字或否決。</p>
<h3>美誓必援助自由國家　抵抗極權國侵略</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：杜魯門總統今在普林斯登大學發表演說，略謂：「美國誓必援助自由國家，抵抗極權國之侵略，並將實施普遍軍訓。此次大戰後瘉　滿月，亟待復興與重建，我人目前之任務，厥為在紊亂中建立有秩序之世界，此種任務艱巨，決非美國或任何一國所能單獨勝任。酷愛和平國家必須羣策羣力，始能有底于成。但除非有實力作為後盾，則穩定之世界無法實現，而各國人民亦必因此無法依照其自由意志決定其本身之命運。美國之精神領導，必須具有力量作其後盾，美國若表現弱點，則弱小國家必認為我人已放棄領導世界之職責，彼等且將誤信我人已無意實行諾言，以援助自由與獨立之國家維持其自由。在此種不安定之情形下，此等弱小國家勢必無法抵抗極權壓力之侵入，我人決不能使友好國家失望。」關于實行普遍軍訓一點，美總統之言有云：「我人訓練靑年，目的不在贏得下一次之戰爭，而在于避免戰爭。」</p>
<h3>華萊士主張召開　杜史兩巨頭會議　組織新黨運動在醖釀中</h3>
<p>〔略透社華盛頓十六日電」前美國副總統華萊士今日在此間「水門」大劇場發表其遊歐來最驚人之演說，請杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿邀請史達林元師及莫洛托夫外長至柏林開會，以解決德奧問題。華萊士並促請美國向聯合國機構建議國際管制武器之完全計劃，以打破原子能管制談判之僵局。渠復主張由民主黨領導發起美國軍火工業收歸國有之運動。使其在履行保衛國家之愛國責任時，不致有人從中獲利。</p>
<p>華萊士並揚言將於一九四八年之總統選舉時，組織第三黨，聲明「若兩大主要政黨繼續進行趨向戰爭及崩潰的自殺政策，將有第三黨之產生，固不問此一第三黨在一九四八年之總統選舉中，是否得有成功希望」。華氏並日：「美國如欲避免經濟不景氣，實需要社會主義的歐洲及蘇聯市塲。若杜魯門及馬歇爾得與史達林及莫洛托夫坦白討論雙方之經濟需要，協定即可成立。吾人若能記得社會主義並無犯罪的成份，吾人即可在和平狀態下與社會主義的歐洲交易」。</p>
<h3>華氏準備參加　下屆總統競選</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕美國前副總統華萊士主張杜魯鬥史達林兩巨頭在柏林會晤，以解決美蘇爭端，現正靜待官方反應，而選拔華萊士為總統之運動，今日已漸具形式。此項運動發起於加利福尼亞州，華氏自稱並無所知。據前加州檢察長凱尼在洛杉磯宣稱，選拔華萊士運動，定於七月十九日在加州法萊斯請開會時進行，華氏雖不出席，但將致電該會云。</p>
<h3>美援助他國　應量力而行</h3>
<p>美前總統佛之貝解</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕美國總統胡佛近致函參院撥款委會主席伯里琪斯氏，略稱美國應賡續援助他國人民，惟同時並須採取步驟，俾免本身之經濟因重大之援助他國負荷而迅速解體。胡氏並謂美國應「堅請」若干國家共同設法減輕此項負担。</p>
<h3>美海員工潮　有擴大趨勢</h3>
<p>鐵路貨運亦有停頓之虞</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十六日電〕美國國外輪船上之海員怠工，其影響今日已波及全國各海港，且有在四十八小時內鐵路貨運亦陷於停頓之虞。工潮似尚無解決之希望，據工會發言人談稱：此次怠工當有二千隻輪船陷於停頓狀態，倘談判完全失敗，則運油船亦將捲入漩渦。勞工部次長吉白森現已奉命抵此與船主進行調解云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕勞工部已派特別代表施章倫巴契飛往舊金山，參加西海岸之航運調解談判。</p>
<h3>匈牙利自由黨集會　共黨搗亂起衝突　棍叉為武器自由黨員五名受傷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社匈牙利史格特十大日電〕共黨約一百五十人，或以橡皮水管中塞硬物作棍，或手指戴鋼戒指，或以斧形匈牙利又為武裝，今日在此間衝散自由黨集會。該會之召集，係欲證明匈牙利是否仍有言論自由及集會自由。參加者有匈牙利男女約七百人，均徒手空拳迎擊共產黨員，變方遂起血戰，共黨員一名被推出三層樓窗，受傷人數不詳。據官方報告，自由黨員五人，頭部被巨叉戳傷甚重，已送醫院救治。該會召集人自由黨領袖蘇里奧克原宣布為主要講員，臨時並未到會。自由黨集會係在此間舞廳三樓舉行，當時有警察三十名在塲監視，會後曾發生全面衝突數起，警察曾以槍柄毆擎雙方衝突者之面部，旋有大隊警察趕到，驅散舞盧外面廣塲上羣衆約一千人。先是，共黨推開守門者衝入會場，有英美記者多人在塲。首次衝突發生於主席介紹國會議員文西那基之時，那基與前總理那基並無關係，但反共態度之激烈，與蘇里奧克無異。那基被共黨員歡呼及高喊「史達林萬歲」之聲音所阻，自由黨亦歡呼「蘇里奧克萬歲」以為對抗，旋又注意到來賓席中之美國記者，即歡呼「美國萬歲」。</p>

<h3>參加國際警備軍　法提出確定數字</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十七日電〕法國已通知聯合國機構，表示在目前僅能供給步兵一師，參加國際警備軍。五大國中提出國際警備軍特定數目，尚以法國為初次。蘇聯堅持各國應同等供給人力，飛機及軍艦，俾國際警備軍保持較小數目。中英美三國贊成根據各自實力，組織國際警備軍，英美海軍與空軍及蘇聯陸軍均應作更多貢獻。</p>
<h3>日報居心叵測　鼓吹收回琉球　傳麥帥確擬「調整」琉球地位</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十七日電〕朝日新聞通信欄今日載冲繩島某居民來函，贊成本月五日外相蘆田要求確定琉球羣島尤其是冲觀島地位之提議。該函堅主日本對冲繩島居民有表示善意之必要，尤其是對目前尚居日本之冲繩島人為然。該函指出自南太平洋各地遣返之日本人，有百分之八十為冲繩島縣人。日本當局徜欲取得該羣島，何不對受苦之冲繩人民加以援手，協助該島之復興，並資助萬千赤貧之人乎？觀察家重視此函之重要性，消息靈通人士雖贊同蘆田之觀點，但認為不合時宜，足以妨礙麥帥之計劃。委帥擬於對日和約締結後，再行調整琉球羣島之地位，屆時殆將舉行公民投票。</p>

<h3>狼虎處死鬨動全市　萬人空巷看雙魔　各有遺書慰母訓子　下田態度倨傲米村言詞狡猾　至死未司猶侈言「中日親善」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「黨熱之狼」米村　喜與「江陰之虎」下出次郎兩罪大悲極之日本即犯，經國防部上海軍事法庭執行死刑，已於昨日下午五時零五分，在江灣刑塲槍決畢命，兩犯至死神色不變，態度自若。刑前立囚車上週遊　市，所經之處，萬人空巷，夾道觀看，交通爲之中斷。市民睹此兩殺人惡　走向靑償血　之路，無不拍手高呼稱快。茲誌群情於後；昨日下午零時三十分，軍事法庭檢察官符樹德，　廣鈞，通譯官羅傑，主任書記官李業初，書記官袁　　，汪叔申等滬備就緒，即會同憲兵警察等向上海監獄出發，車抵抻籃獄門口時，該幾萬頭　動，牆上電綫桿上亦滿立人羣，見軍車到來，當聲四起。檢察官等進入蓋獄即就女監進口處之天井山設立臨時法台，命提不田米村兩犯。兩犯在獄中聆悉後，要求沐浴剃鬚，端正軍服，經一小時餘始畢。二時正：首提下田次郎，下田步人時，神態倨傲，但稍幣戚容。</p>
<h3>點頭苦笑端坐寫遺書</h3>
<p>符檢察官告以今日執行，該犯點頭，繼詢以有無遺言，下田即索筆壘，就　備之桌椅端坐後揮筆直書，筆爲通譯官羅傑之自來水筆，紙爲軍事法庭之公文紙。下田寫至第二張時墨水用罄，即另索墨筆續寫，歷二十五分鐘寫成還　兩封，一致日本憲兵司令十川中將，一致其母（詳後）。檢察官再問以尚有話說否？下田稱：「本案與我實無關係，將來可以明白」。繼詢以要否打麻醉針，下田傲稱「不需要」遂即上綁，時該犯身軀微顫，似欲泣下，但又作苦笑，並說：「請關照憲兵勿綁得太緊，我不會逃。」二時三十五分下田先押上囚車，續提米村春喜。米村步入時面作苦笑並向兩旁點頭。符檢察官同樣告以今日執行，詢其有無遺言，米村亦索紙用壘筆書寫，寫至第二頁數行時停筆中斷，另索一紙重行寫過，寫完兩頁後意猶未　，要求庭上再准寫一張，歷三十分鐘始憲成遺書三封，一致十川中將等，一致其子，一致常熟前縣長現爲議長之安蔚南（詳後）。</p>
<p>下田次郎（右）與米村春喜（左）遊街後押抵江灣刑塲</p>
<p>四面觀者如堵（本報攝）</p>
<h3>問答數語　押上囚車</h3>
<p>寫畢檢察官再詢以尚有話說否？米村說：「常熟太倉的居民希望把我帶到常熟去執行，今天在上海執行很不好」，繼而沉思片刻，又說：「本案我實無關，如詳细調查可以明瞭眞相。」米村對於打麻醉針亦加以拒絕，在上綁之前又說：「今日如果有蒙難中國人的家屬在此，請替我打個招呼。」符檢察官最後又問以蒙難者多有屍骨不知在何處者，問米村可知道？米村說：「這最好要到日本去調查，我不知道」。旋即押上囚車。</p>
<h3>刑塲圍觀者　潮湧</h3>

<h3>同濟復課生波折　敎務長等聯合辭職以謝學校　校長董洗凡昨晚晉京請示</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕同濟大學自學潮發生後，各院系大部罷課。校長董洗几，為免陽生犧牲光陰學業，迭次勸導復課，未能生效。董氏自以督教無方，誤人子弟，表示慚憾，且以體力不支，難應繁劇，前後三度呈部辭職，雖經部方懇切挽留，辭意仍堅。日昨該校各行政部分首長，以學生無復課誠意，聯合提出辭職　。經　氏挽留無效，當夜赴京向教部請示。目下該校行政，入於停頓狀態。茲探錄該校佈告及各行政首長辭書如左：</p>
<p>佈告</p>
<p>「查本校自受學潮影響以來，除新生院及各院系高級班，以及附設高級護士學校，附設聲事檢騐職業科，附設機械工程專修科，或照堂上課朱曾間斷，或顧惜學業早已復課外，其他各班級罷課已逾三週之久，大好光陰任意犧牲，何等可惜！本校不忍諸生學業長此蒙受損失，並謀速復學校正常態度起見，再經召集學生代表訓話，該生等對於本校苦心勸導，頗能理解接受，表示即日復課。乃散會後，竟有暫行上課之決議，其不熱心於學業，於此可見。繼則學生自治會否認決議，而有暫緩上踝以待覆決之呈請，言行反覆如此，殊使師長寒心。本校各院處行政負責首長，對此輕率行為，表示異常失望，因履行當日面對諸生之聲明，聯合提出辭書，經懇切挽留無效，遂使學校行政立即陷於停頓狀况。具有四十年榮譽之學校，一旦瀕臨飄搖傾頹之境地，諸生難辭其責。除本人尅夜赴京，親向教育部請示外，合將各首長聯名辭職　公佈如左。仰諸生速自覺悟，即日一律復課，俾校局日趨平謐，恢復弦育正軌，勿重負全體師長深切之期望，切切此佈。校長董洗月，六月十七日。」</p>
<p>辭書</p>
<p>「洗凡校長先生道席：本校學生罷課經月，頃聞自明日起將休止罷課，不稱復課，而名之曰休，足徵學生毫無恢復求學。查學生罷課後，鈞座會兩度通告令即復課，同人等亦再三勸諭，務以學業為重，乃言諄聽藐，曷勝浩歎！同人等尸位素餐，有負職責，今謹辭去行政職務，以謝學校，諸維亮察不宣，專此祇頌勛綏。教務長謝蒼漓，訓導長葉雪安，總務長周冠軍，工學院院長江鴻，文理學院院長顧葆常，兼附中校長江鴻，兼附職校長胡兆瑛。」</p>

<h3>王志莘等返滬　悶葫蘆仍未打破　市塲傳言格外多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所總經理不志莘·協理楊　溥·顧善昌·業於昨發自京返滬。據悉：不氏等此行，曾與財部次長徐柏園。錢幣司長戴銘禮。經部商樂司長鄧翰良·及兩部主管科長，洽談甚祥。王氏等曾就證交市塲，目前對物價，利息，安定金融各方面之影響，及遞延交易之作用，利弊得失等，詳細向當局面陳實情。兩部表示今後對證交之新措置，仍請靜候部令頒到施行云。</p>
<p>又經紀人方面盛傳：（一）遞延交易，准再延期三個月，至本年九月底止。（二）遞交證據金代用品部份，現金與美金債券仍可同時並用。（三）遞交交易額超過六十億元者，須再繳證據金二成，該項增　證據金，上市股票及美金債劵均可並用。記者曾以該項傳訊，詢諸證交某發言人，渠稱：對此事未有所聞云。</p>
<h3>統債外股平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨稍見疲，成交祇四百餘萬，起仆狹窄。統丙晨開七千三，高價七千五，低價六千九，最後七千三左右掙扎。洋行帮及五〇三室有納，三六〇室二三〇室則出。結果較前收計甲乙戊各跌二百元，丁丙各挫三百元。</p>
<p>外股昨初高後回，怡紗晨開七二五〇〇元，即告下落至六九〇〇〇元結束。散戶稍售，廣帮亦出怡　，洋行帮及金業中人則進，成交不多。港申電報十四元四，無甚影響。結果較前收計航業徵升，怡　紙業業服各跌半成，英聯會德　稍降，怡紗鋼業電話平平。</p>
<h3>游資由津流滬　達數百億元以上</h3>
<p>最近數日，由天津流入滬市之游資，極為衆多。各商業銀行錢莊連日接受該處匯來款項極多，詳細數雖無法估計，惟衆信當在數百億元之多。據悉此項游資，均係經過滬上而逃避至香港者。在滬不多稽留，即繼續以各種方法逃避香港。故對滬上物價，可不致有壓力。按此項游資，一部份尚係東北流入天津轉來，一部份則係天津與北方其他都市之資金。</p>
<h3>今後生絲外銷　將以易貨爲原則　政府決扶助蠶絲事業發展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖三省收購春繭工作，刻已告一段落。烘成乾繭，亦已陸續進倉，即待繅製生絲。至缫製生絲後之出路間題，刻正由中央銀行，中央信託局，中蠶公司等關係機關，擬議計劃中，聞將來外銷辦法，將以對外易貨為原則。</p>
<p>正考慮中者，一為對美易取人造絲，一為對越南易取米糧。對美易貨計劃，擬每月對美轍出生美一千五百擔，依照目前美國生絲與人迭絲之差價比例，月可易取人造絲約七千箱。我國目前方感人造絲缺貨，市價飛黃騰達，預計對美輸出生絲一萬擔，所易收之人造絲，已足敷全國一年之需。（按我國目前每月人造絲之消耗量，不過三千箱）。故有此易貨人造絲供應，當可解決絲織業一部份之原料問題。</p>
<p>聞農經兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，亦將為研究該項生絲對外易貨事宜，而另組設計委員會，俾將研究所得，供獻當局採納施行云。</p>
<p>中蠶公司總經理葛敬中稱：政府對於蠶絲事業之發展，決不惜巨資加以扶助，因此舉與復興農村經濟有關，並可增加輸出。</p>
<p>本年春繭收購，因顧到蠶農成本，對未來蠶絲事業已徵露曙光，蠶農對桑樹等之培植恢復，原有興趣，故預計今後蠶繭產量，可超過戰前。</p>
<p>當局對於絲織品人造絲之採用，因有助於絲綢之出口，是以亦儘可能予以設法，惟今後對該業需要之人遭絲，必須有助於輸出，至少應收回相同數額之外匯。又該公司對廣東各地絲蠶事業，正謀扶助其復興，該公司將派技師二人，前往工作云。</p>
<h3>食米市勢平定　食油價格上升</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千一百餘石，北市早疲午緊，粳秞略挺三五千元，白陰元平正。南市粳米見升三五千元，秈米回高萬元，白元高貨定局，中次白元去化不振，下挫萬元。陰元銷路不爽，亦然回低萬元，四川秈米首批抵申品質尚佳。</p>
<p>麵粉略有參差，洋粉回跌一二千元，廠粉亦趨疲勢，客粉平　，惟統粉則去化尚可，挺升一二千元。麸皮廠方開出寥寥，鄉銷蟬聯，續漲四五千元。新麥廠胃轉濃，回漲七八千元。</p>
<p>豆餅步砌一二千元，惟午時轉懈，黃豆消化活霾，績加三五千元，綠豆依然站平，赤豆亦無變化，莞豆平正，苞米站定，紅糧亦少軒輕。</p>
<p>生仁滬南銷路活潑，市形牢立。芝蔴貨稀堅挺。</p>
<p>油市內地堅昂，店銷活洛，貨主甚堅，’生油再漲萬元，豆油飛升二三萬元，淸油猛騰萬元。蔴油菜油亦然挺升一二萬元。</p>
<h3>白糧趨勢步鬆</h3>

<h3>六區棉紡公會　條陳施政方針</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會頃特擬呈紡織事業調節委員施政方針意見四，希望該會鋻核採納，茲特探誌如次：</p>
<p>一，委員會受政府之命，在紡織業自由營業原則之下，督導國營民營各廠，計劃原棉之增產供應，調節成品之供朮，以穩定市價，並爭取國外市塲，達成整個紡織業合理之發展。</p>
<p>二，為貫澈國營民營廠合作起見，委員會各處主管人員，應由民營廠共同參加配合工作。</p>
<p>三，對於金融，燃煤，原料，運銷，轍出，以前國營所得便利，在公平原則之下，民營廠應與國營廠受同等之待遇。</p>
<p>四，前紡管會之措施，不合調節原則者，應即廢止。</p>
<h3>本市製針工業　生產量遠不如前　原料缺乏影響成本甚大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處統計：目前本市製針工業之生產量，僅達最高產量之百分之五十四，尚可積極提高。製針工業之主要原料，為盤元及錦皮盤元，戰前國內未能生產，全部由英美比等國家輸入，戰後自政府實行輸入管制後，來源日見緊縮，除各廠自存原料外，祇有以高價向圃戶收購之一途，對製品之成本，影響頗大。現唯一希望寄托於國內公營及民營鋼鐵廠之復工，俾能供應必需之原料。</p>
<p>至於銷路，可分三方而討論：（一）縫衣針之銷路，戰前每年約為二萬八千八百箱，其中百分之六十銷於印度南洋一帶，餘供國內之用。戰後供求情形稍變，卅五年全年產量為九千六百箱，四分之一為內銷，其餘悉數外銷。以目前平均市價計算，每箱以國幣四百五十萬元計算，總值可達國幣三百四十五億以上，約合美金二百八十萬元；如以最高產量計算，外銷可達一萬七千二百箱以上，總值約合美金六百五十萬元。</p>
<p>（二）襪針及織針之銷路，戰前每年產量爲四千八百萬至六千萬隻，因國內求過於供，無外銷可言。戰後國內需要减少，因有餘量得供外銷，現內外銷數大致相等。根據卅五年之統計，外銷總值可達國幣一百億，合美金八十三萬元；以最大產量計算，則外銷價值可提高至國幣八千一百五十。萬元（三）別針及唱針，因產量尚不敷內銷之用，目前並無銷出。</p>
<h3>粗紗銷塲熱身賽俏</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因漢口及其他客帮本街染織廠對二十支粗紗需求甚殷，特變馬收價為八百九十萬，比上日步漲二十萬元。雙馬紗升十五萬元。四二支及四十支細紗走銷不暢，所升甚微，其餘二十支及十六支紗，統扯軋升十萬至三十萬元。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布二六四六五疋，被單二八〇條。內廠商申購單六七張，共購布三六二五疋。布號申購單八五三張，共購布二三八四〇疋，被單二八〇條。</p>
<p>又訊，頃據紡建公司業務處蔣處長稱，十二磅能頭細布，即日起暫緩供售。因須撥交中央銀行收購出口，其他細布均照常供應，至何時恢復開配，須視將來情形而定。</p>
<h3>棉花市況穩定</h3>
<p>昨日棉市，因棉紗實銷轉佳，紗價繼週一漲風仍在盤高局面，於是人心堅定，執貨者不肯輕脫，更因紗廠均有納胃，客帮亦有添辦，市况呈穩定趨勢，成交與上日相同。午後做開印棉白洛去一六七萬，又N.T.為一六九萬五千元，靈寶一六三萬，火機一一三萬五千元至一一五萬元，南太倉一二二萬，通州粗絨一二四萬，以上均為送廠價。又綫交價做開計　實一五三萬五千元至一五七萬，火機一〇九萬至一一五萬，通州組絨一二四萬，冲通一二〇萬，通州木架一二〇萬，海提尖一〇七萬五千元，周浦籽花每組（司馬秤六十斤）一九萬至二一萬。</p>
<h3>濟南棉業　籲請協助</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十七日電〕濟市棉業公會以本年四月，禁止本市棉花外運，兩月以來，該會六十餘家棉商，損失達七十億之巨。而滬靑等地因棉花缺乏，反自國外訂購美棉，經多方呼籲後，近雖解禁，而四行雨局突又停止棉業貨款，致該業陷于奄奄待斃之境。該會為此特招待新聞界，請代呼籲協助云。</p>
<h3>香烟市況不振</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟初開，市氣即呈平疲，蓋聞英美烟存底豐沛，永泰和派貨，午後開始繳款，同業銀根，又見緊迫，塲中外埠同行對哈德門籌備貨不寂，進戶甚淸，故最後十支大英烟價為六百三十四萬元，比上日回瀉九萬元。老刀牌烟亦小十一萬元，五華牌底五萬元。哈德門因拋多，猛跌二十萬元。全日烟市趨勢，又呈下游，華商條烟價亦軋降一二百至七八百元不一，高等烟大南未及大三砲亦有拋售，下挫一千五百至三千元許，美烟六根馬力斯等銷路尚佳，中以六根市尤倘俐。</p>
<h3>特種輸入品　許可證統一簽發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會特種委員會第十四次例會，於十六日下午三時舉行。討論經過，對：（一）外交人員輸入貨品，（二）宗教慈善教育機關輸入貨品，及（三）個人自用及家用輸入貨品，業已決金其輸入條例。現對該項輸入品許可證，決統一簽發。並為簡化手續計特授權輸管會各區辦事處，參照規定條例，酌量核發許可證云。</p>
<h3>肥皂火柴俱降</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市面，塲中轉賣不寂，聞某同業以黃祥戊皂甘五萬五千元價，大量拋出，頓時　氣濃厚，行情趨疲。至景後黃祥茂皂比上日下挫四五千元，一百六十塊白祥戊，亦小二千元。固本皂帶小三千元，箭刀皂籌碼不充，去化尚佳，市獨堅穩。其他各牌，均見軋降二千至五千元左右。</p>
<p>火柴走銷，不甚暢吒，同業迫於銀根，咸抱觀望，致各牌市面下挫一二萬至三四五萬，美麗惟牌市較堅固。</p>
<h3>雜路圓續升</h3>
<p>雜路大粒桂圓，以到存極稀，而產區　底將斷，故去化雖少，趨勢仍緊。昨開出百數件，又升四五萬元。</p>
<h3>日本私人貿易恢復後　中日貿易難望展開　楊津生返滬談三大困難</h3>
<p>中央信託局副經理，兼駐日代表團商務顧問楊津生氏，日前赴日公幹，歷時一月有半，十六日始乘輪返抵此問。據楊氏語聯合徵信所記者，此次赴日與麥帥德部交涉易貨事宜，結果極為圓滿，今後是否有新發展，當視政府政策而定。人造絲仍陸續運來，輸日食鹽，本年預定為一百萬噸，以運轍關係，已受影響，本年至多可運出一百萬噸。關於開放日本私人貿易問題，據楊氏稱，此事美政府已決定八月十五日正代表數目之分配，將由盟國遠東委員會，盟國貿易局決定。代表商決定以後，可與日本廠商無限制接觸。關於貿易種類，數量價格，統由麥師總部決定。且日元匯率，不加訂定，各種商品流通後，再行決定。在日本和約未簽訂以前，此為局部開放對日之經濟封鎖。楊氏繼就日本私人貿易恢復，對我進出品之前途，表示意見。楊氏認爲困難尙多，（一）爲外無匯率，在貿易時，日圓匯率不定，且我之外匯，由政府控制，我進口商不能交傳遞美元或英鎊，以換取日本之貨物。（二）對日貿易貨物價格，須由麥帥總部核准，查我出口物資，目前成本甚昂，如貿易時，麥帥總部不按實際成本核算，我商人必遭致鉅大之損失。（三）中日需要貨品，大都相同，現日本願輸出者，為生絲紡織品等，我輪日者亦大致相同。他如燃料，食糧，我則無法應其需要。此為日本私人貿易恢復後之最大困難。楊氏又稱，在此種情形下，大多數之貿易，仍將由政府與政府問進行。</p>
<p>又訊，盟國駐日最高統帥部刻已決定今年八月問部份開放日本貿易，我國人士，對此成極關心。茲悉：自日本投降後，我國雖有貿易往來，均係採取易貨方式。由中信局統籌辦理，今秋日本貿易開放後，我國與之貿易關係，仍可保持現有方式，內政府控制。至私人間雖有往來，但必須經過政府嚴格審核，故一般人所躭心之日本工業製造品，將大量輸入，實為過慮</p>

<h3>烈風席捲汚雲　豫省積極展開　肅清貪污運動</h3>
<p>— 開封十三日航訊　本報記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>貪污的雲</p>
<p>籠罩着整個政治天空的今天，河南的官民共同發起了一個肅淸貧汚運動，這是一件很使人興奮的事情，多少人都睜着雪亮的眼睛，等着這一運動可能發生的效果</p>
<p>豫省新運會特定下週爲肅淸貪汚運動宣傳週，自十五日起，每日下午八時，聘請黨政團首長及各界領袖與社會賢運輪流作廣播演講，省黨部陳主委　嶺担任第一天廣播，他講肅淸貪汚與轉移社會風氣，第二天由靑年團支團部幹事長胡長怡講肅淸貪汙與新生活運動，第三天由省參會議長　積學論　淸當汚興中華民屆，第四天由民歡廳長張辛南講如何　淸貪汚，第五天由省府馬秘書長凌甫講　淸貪汚與澄淸吏治，第六天由豫魯監察使郭仲隗講肅淸貪汚與建國，第七天由高等法院院長周予孜講肅淸貪汚與端正人心。由這些廣播題目中，使人們共同感覺到不論按那一方面，都應該趕快肅淸貪汚！所以在理論上，「肅淸貪汚」幾乎成了人同此心，心同此環的要求了，而人們更迫切的要求還是切切實實的執行。</p>
<p>豫省參會始終沒有忽略了這一點，爲了愛護政府，爲了</p>
<p>愛護地方</p>
<p>，他們對肅淸貪汚不僅在理論上犬聲疾呼，在行動上他們也毫不苟且馬虎。他們組織了淸査團，近來日夜集會，商討工作步驟，經過幾度商酌之後，他們決定先淸査河南省衛生處。</p>
<p>參加這次淸査工作的參議員是劉　炎，呂蘊儒，戴祥驅，王俊傑，張谿然，喬昭然，蘆繼禮等，因爲要澈査該處帳目，所以又邀了省府秘書處會計室李朝陽及會計處會計室高建農一同前往，同時他們並請省立開封醫院長上官悟　，省立　州醫院畏閻仲彝及傳染病院長甘一塊於昨日上午九時到該處淸査。</p>
<p>這一羣鐵面無情的。</p>
<p>民意代表</p>
<p>，浩浩蕩蕩走進了衛生處，據該虞處長史國　聲稱：該虞藥庫司　曹煥章於前日逃逸，淸査　以淸査　庫爲其　要工作，不得已，乃由該處第二科長孫　陪同　其藥庫淸查藥品，見四間陰暗矮小的藥庫中，　有少數粗糙藥品，雜亂排置，原始單據已蕩然　存，支付數　亦混淆不淸，料長孫濟及秘書　　志均吞吐含糊，支吾其詞。所有帳目底蘊詳情　也不知道。該團無法，乃將藥庫對存，將現有之領發藥品登記證八册帶走、現正在核對中。　　上午該團且爲此事召開會議。據此間中國時報今日刋戴衛生處史國潘貪汚</p>
<p>嫌疑重大</p>
<p>稱二「……史國潘，江蘇人，民國卅一年任衛生處處長，當時省府尙設洛陽，關於藥品之收發，設有專門委員會司其事，史氏以主任委員資格，負責召集，但自省府　香山後，中某即以召集不易爲辭，該委員會遂同虛設，而當時國際紅十字會之藥品時源源而來，普通藥如奎寗丸，阿司匹　等每次常以數十萬粒計，及省府三遷至宛西後，宛西與西安之間交通頻繁，而衛生處亦常常派人往返於豫陜這上，遂不得不增人疑竇。光復以後，教濟分署亦常常以藥品交付該處配發各縣，但各縣來人具領者，率多悵然而返，即如盤尼西林一項，救署原定非賣品，曾以八百支交付該處，免費注射病人，今已不知去向，而其他藥物之損失，更無法以數字計。」</p>
<p>據淸査團同人吿記者，史國潘確係實汚有據，司庫曹煥章棄職潛逃，亦係有人唆使，在逃跑前曾以十八箱藥品交廣濟大藥房代賣。</p>
<p>這一案現正淸査中，這一案也是淸査團工作的開始，政府協助着他們，人民擁護着他們，他們的工作可能順利的進行下去，更可能獲得美滿的結果，只有決心是一致的，相信這股巨風必定能把貪汚的爲雲捲去，使蔚藍的政治晴空，重新在河南的頂上出現。</p>
<h3>塘沽新港一瞥（下）</h3>
<p>— 天津八日航訊　邢契莘</p>
<p>三年計劃</p>
<p>新港工程，承日人未完工作及停頓破壞之後，雖於三十五年略啓其端，然對於整個工作之觀成，必須在最初三年之內，奠定其基礎，以開將來擴大之途徑，此三年間之工作，以疏濬及防波堤工程爲主，其餘配合工程如完成乾船塢，擴充修船廠，舖建鐵路公路，添購機械船舶等項亦屬當務之急，又隨時與鐵路公路方面配合連繫，完成水陸聯運，俾一面興修一面營業，以收挹注之效，此項三年計劃完成之後，再視津塘兩地工商業發展情形，以定未來之方針，庶可達到築港完成之任務。</p>
<p>茲將三年計劃工程數量及完成後綜合所收之效果，略述於次：</p>
<p>重要工作</p>
<p>（一）防波堤：整理原有南防波堤長四千五百公尺，北防堤三千八百公尺，即將未完成之石堤加緊完成，計拋石十二萬立方公尺，舖洋灰方塊一萬二千立方公尺，打單綫鋼板樁一六五〇公尺，</p>
<p>（二）航這：港內主航道浚渫至七十公尺之寬度，挖掘至六公尺之深度，第一碼頭前挖深至六公尺，第二碼頭前挖深至八公尺，船閘東西口挖深至五公尺。</p>
<p>（三）碼頭：第二碼頭原有裝煤機二架，修復使用，其東之駁船碼頭長三百七十公尺，已完成百分之二十五左右，本年擬完成之，以便使用，又利用挖出之淤泥，塡築成汕料碼頭，本年先築　岸三百公尺，保護堤岸。</p>
<p>（四）塡築：碼頭基地，係以疏浚之泥砂，利用排泥管冲塡之，本年預計完成一百七十萬立方公尺，以平均高度四公尺計算，可得碼頭用地七百餘市畝，但此項新塡築之土地，須三年以後始能使用。</p>
<p>（五）船閘：平整船閘附近地面，尙須塡土二萬立方公尺，幷改善附近環境，現有船閘操縱室之電氣設備，係臨時設備，擬由日本將原來設計之電氣操縱設備講來更換，又船閘兩側應備擋水用之浮船兩套，以爲閘門損壞時修理之用。</p>
<p>（六）陸上設備：裝卸設備，擬先添置三噸及二十五噸起重機各二架，幷將現有鐵路十公里加以整理，遇必要時擬　築十一公里，公路亦擬添築五公里。</p>
<p>（七）電力設備：日人築港之時，置有一萬二千KVA之第二變壓所一處曁高壓線路等設備，原爲挖泥船在港內碼頭東端距岸較遠處工作而設，早已完全破壞，現僅有二千四百KVA變壓所一處，不僅全部挖泥船不能同時開動，即機廠擴充後，或僅能敷機廠工作之用，故必須增設六千KVA變壓所一處，另添設一千KVA發電機四套，以謀自行發電，便利工作。</p>
<p>（八）船塢及船舶：挖泥工作，爲維持港道通暢起見，即在平時亦極關重要，除修復原有各項船隻外，擬新購或租用大型吸泥式挖泥船一二隻，又爲冬季封凍，擬購破冰船一二隻，以配合疏浚及碎冰之用，惟船舶損壞後之修理，從前日人利用大沽造船所及太古公司等各處船塢，勝利以後，各該船塢均由原主分別收回，新港全無此項設備，修船極感困難，本年度擬將日人未完成之二千噸乾船塢一所，予以完成，幷添築簡單修船塢一所，添設機廠工作機械及運土給水各項船舶，以便配合工程之進行，又添置駁船及拖輪各十餘載，以便利運輸，完成水陸聯運。</p>
<p>（九）給水排水設備：添漬水池一座，埋設上永管五千公尺。</p>
<p>（十）航路標識：添置浮筒二十二套，自明浮標十一套，燈塔二座，霧號誌二座，燈標六座，信號三所，分設港內以利航行。</p>
<p>各項效果</p>
<p>本年度工程進行完成後，可獲下列各項效果：</p>
<p>（一）三千噸級輪船隨時經過船閘，往返天津。</p>
<p>（二）第一碼頭同時可停泊三千噸級或吃水五公尺以下輪船五至七艘，預計每年裝卸量約一百萬噸。</p>
<p>（三）第二碼頭裝煤棧，可裝卸煤斤每年約一百萬噸，大同開　井陘產煤，可由新港裝運出口。</p>
<p>（四）駁船碼頭可完成。</p>
<p>（五）油料碼頭護岸可完成。</p>
<p>（六）乾船塢及修船設備完成，足敷自用船舶修理之用。</p>
<p>（七）堆棧可存放貨物一萬五千噸。</p>
<p>（八）運輸業務，可裝卸停泊大沽口外之巨輪貨物。</p>
<p>（九）水陸聯運初步完成。</p>

<p>未來展望</p>
<p>日人建築新港之目的，原爲對日翰出　　礬土等主要物資，對華輸入成品，與我國之經濟及國際貿易，固渺不相涉也。現在新港旣經我國收回自築，自應審度我國經濟狀况對外貿易及華北工商業之需要，考其得失，量其緩急，重訂工程計劃，根據中美專家意見，及勘査硏究之結果，咸認爲新港工程，應先着重於基本之設施，而樹將來擴大之基礎，始不悖於建設經濟之原則。</p>
<p>新港工程，三十五年度僅整理破壞器材房屋，完成日人已施工而未完工之一部份，今後三年工作，努力於新港工程之基本設施，以應付華北一帶客貨之運輸，其後再視津塘間之運輸狀沉，及華北工商業繁榮之成果，再定擴充計劃，俾可適合實情，逐漸發展。</p>
<p>至於貨物之吞吐量，日人原定計畫相當應大，以二千七百萬噸之煤鹽鐵礬土雜貨等每年吞吐量爲建築之目標，而以八百萬噸爲第一期工程之　的，施工五載，完成未半，現在按照三年計劃施工，完成之後，每年吞吐量爲二百萬噸，若裝卸設備齊金，可達四百萬噸，將來再增建碼頭，加强運輸設　，可望增加至一二千萬噸，在全國各港中佔極重要之位置。</p>
<p>日人築港遺留之未成基地，頗爲廣闊，將來逐步興修，配合市政建設，必可成爲一繁榮之市區，然後向北發展，直至薊運河口之北塘，區域更爲推廣，故未來之新港，必將成爲北太平洋國際貿易上之要港。</p>
<h3>正氣磅礴　理智充沛　成都學潮一幕</h3>
<p>— 成都十一日航訊　本報記者周學端</p>
<p>這次動燙全國的學潮，反應在成都，並不如一般陰謀家想像的熱烈，學生的正養，冲刷了野心家的妄圖，更進一步的由於學生界的自動發覺，暴露　　　涉國際的學潮陰謀，使野心家不能不銷聲匿跡，平靜成都，終於在此次學潮中安穩過去。</p>
<p>學潮聲中</p>
<p>成都特殊表現</p>
<p>正當京滬學潮沸騰熾盛的時候，成都學生界表現的是冷靜，理智。雖然極少數的中等學校一度醞釀罷課舉動，但旋即被全體大中學同學正義說服。這其間，有川大，華西，成華諸大學及省立會計，藝術，體育等專科學校學生自治會。通電京滬同學，深盼體念國家艱難，勿受黨派利用，保持五四以來學生運動的光輝成就。在中樞維特社會秩序辦法公佈之後，復有川大，成華等校廿四文化學術團體，通電表示擁護，並勸吿京滬同學勿採激越行動，停止罷課，靜候政府公正處置。同時全市學校，表示了一致意見，堅決反對以罷課遊行作手段，破壞靑年學業，於是野心家的離間狡計，遂無所施展。</p>
<p>罷課陰謀</p>
<p>結果未成事實</p>
<p>當「六二」前夕，部份陰謀家企圖在「六二」煽動局部學校罷課遊行。由華大西籍敎授費爾卜主持，召集各大中學生舉行罷課策動大會，但屆時到者寥寥，僅華大，華西高中，中華女中五校學生廿六人，決定「六二」發動罷課遊行，並擴大製造血案，當場即因意見紛歧引起爭執。同時一般有熱血的大中學生聞訊之下，憤慨萬分，立即繕發緊急號外數百大張，分貼全市。將其會議內容曁捐動陰謀，一一臚列。於是怒火燃遍整個學生界，當日午後全市大中學生代表，共卅八單位代表四百餘人，在齊魯大學召熱烈舉行護校運動大會，在憤慨熱烈情緒下，決議：（一）成立成都市各大中學反罷課反暴動運動大會，（二）電吿全國同學，（三）電慰平滬護校受傷同學。到會同學即席慷懷捐輸，立集巨款匯京慰問受傷同學，全塲高呼：反對「吃光」，「饑餓」，「三罷」，打倒利用靑年製浩學潮的陰謀家等口號，正義呼聲，響遍整個成都市。</p>
<p>正義鬥爭</p>
<p>揭露外人密謀</p>
<p>由於這大部份學生的正義感，立即獲得全市大中學生十餘萬人的全體支援，野心家不得不被迫偃旗息鼓，預定的「六二」罷課遊行臨時作罷，「六二」！這緊張的一天平靜地過去。事後，費爾卜表函中央社，申述彼僅爲一宗敎及文學敎員，絕無黨派背景，主持罷課大會，純出誤會。但第二天即有曾在塲目擊開會情形的同學們，公開反駁，列舉開會經過，證明費氏確爲中堅份子，並要求政府請費氏離開成都，這重公案迄今猶未解決。</p>

<h3>在戲院中</h3>
<p>— 楊文</p>
<p>在一個電影院裏又聽到了噓聲。</p>
<p>這聲音是那末熟悉，仔細想了想，原來是在重慶時常聽到的。</p>
<p>一個人在山城裏一住六七年，生活自然是够無聊的，尤其是凄風苦雨的晚上，時間更無法消遣。漸漸我懂得到昇平鼓書塲去聽富貴花，記得最初是五角錢泡上一杯茶，可以坐到夜深。戲散了，隨着人羣出來，午夜的馬路靜靜的，街燈拖長了淡淡的影子。也許牛毛雨仍然下着，那就更增加幾分詩意。轉幾個彎，一路走着的行人愈見稀少了，最後只剩一個人伴着自己的影子。馬路上除了自己的脚步外沒有一點聲息。我愛這樣深夜靜幽的馬路，有時甚而爲了嚐受這韻味而到戲院子裘呆坐上幾點鐘。</p>
<p>戲院子裏的戲或電影並不一定使人滿意。最呌人不舒服的是鼓堂或噓，尤其是對着銀幕上的人物。</p>
<p>是小時候在家中聽別人說的　，有一次某鄉間唱社戲。張士貴和尉遲恭出來了，正唱到熱鬧處　，台下的西瓜皮和土塊向台上拋了。更從台下躍上一條大漢，扯住張士貴就打。等到幾個人將他們拉開，被打的已站不起來了。有人對打人的說，「這是唱戲，不是眞事啊！」那人仍氣忿忿地回答，「要是眞的非打死他不完呢。」自然，戲沒法繼續唱下去，就這末完了，故事的講述也隨着完了。我當時聽了非常茫然，不知道會不會眞有這類事，看戲的眞會登台打假扮的混賬奸臣張　貴麽？我不曉得。</p>
<p>後來我才明白，這是城市中號的一種「農村形式」，也許會有。在城市中遇見這類情形就不同了，觀衆的反應是噓，上台打人的事是不多見的。比起來，「文明」得多了。</p>
<p>和噓相反的是豉掌，富貴花出來，唱上一段，掌聲在全塲中雷動了；到「大西廂」的「邁步進了書房門」，掌聲又饗了，夾雜着怪聲呌好。「我說，哥哥呀，」台下是一片應聲。老殘記黑紐說書，向全塲掃一眼，連坐在最後角上的聽客都覺得「黑紐看到我了。」這一應聲，同樣的，雖不是「富貴花喊我哥哥」，却是「我賺了富貴花的便宜了」。童芷苓更妙了，不用開口，眼一　，身子一扯，怪好聲便隨着響了起來。</p>
<p>人眞是沒法理解的，長衫革履，斯斯文文借了燈光的昏暗，借了人羣的雜沓，竟會發出這末與身份不相調和的聲調。更奇怪的是也從未見到人們對這些聲音起什麽反感，認爲是下流或屬於下流類的行徑。頂多向那方向看一看，或笑一笑。大概本來都是爲的尋找刺激，正同樣地陶醉在刺激中了。</p>
<p>我最怕的還不是這些，是同樣的手法使用在電影院裏：忽而噓，忽而鼓掌，又忽而噓夾鼓掌。這塲合常是映到一個奸臣型的壞蛋遭殃，或正得意，或是男女接吻。尤其對於後者是每次必噓，且甚而加以鼓掌的。大槪祗能採用弗洛依德才能解釋，這種心理吧！</p>
<p>戲台上打的噓的雖不是張士貴，只是一個戲子，然究竟是一個活代表；被鼓呌好的當貴花童芷苓，更不消說了，滿足的微笑着退回後台，而鼓掌或呌好者也自以爲彼美已知，精神上有了「聯系」。只有對銀幕狂喊，觀噓，明明知道彼方毫無所知，那末又是所爲何來？</p>
<p>人類有許多行爲是無法解釋的，這是其中之一。</p>
<p>眞的，「人之異於禽歡者幾希。」其愚笨處何嘗較好於蜀犬吠日或蒼蠅的撞玻璃？論優點，和平不及鴿子，耐性不及刷羊。祗有虛僞做作，裝作淸高和慈愛，比萬物高明得多，然而這又算得什麽德行！我倒寗愛那誠然不乾淨，却也從不自鳴淸高的蛆虫。一會，全塲子裏又顯得極爲靜謐了。在暗淡的光線也可以淸晰地看出，一張張油膩的黄面皮架在一條條伸長了的　子上，唾水向喉管裏倒流，慢慢下巴掛了下去，嘴張了開來：是完全神往了。說不定會正在這副尊容下又爆發出一聲怪呌或高噓。</p>
<p>我興起了欲笑不能的心情。我想起了不久之前在一個京戲院裏看見的一慕。「殺子報」的花且扭揑作態，和尙跪下調情，觀衆和今天現出了同樣的表情。</p>
<p>「十個娘們九個……</p>
<p>怕你爺們嘴不穩。」</p>
<p>掌聲雷動，夾着怪呌，間時爆出哄然大笑。唱下去，唱下去，到和尙被逮，還不等花旦見官，阿狗拉着阿貓走了，「快完了，底下沒啥苗頭。」只見「殺子」，是看不見什麽「報」的。唱的這末唱，聽的也這末聽，只有論的不同，一本正經的提出什麽敎育問題，人生問題。</p>
<p>理論和實際往往是這末不同呵！</p>
<h3>記馬公愚</h3>
<p>— 治源</p>
<p>提起了「馬公愚」這三個字，只要是上海居住過的而稍懂一點文藝的人，我想沒有一個會覺得陌生的吧！</p>
<p>在現在中國固有的藝術—書畫等，岌岌可危的當兒，他已經成爲目前書畫藝壇上的一個權威了。他非但是一個書法家，而且更是一個畫家及金石家。我們到處可以看到他的墨蹟，尤其是隸書，寫一手漢張遷碑，當然已進入化境，雄渾壯健，異常的有魄力。除了書法，還有他的畫與雕刻，差不多沒有一個人不佩服的。</p>
<p>中等的身材，微微彎曲着背，圓正的面孔，精神飽滿，鼻梁上架着一副黑邊眼鏡。而最惹人注意的是長長的黑　，飄在胸前，名士的風度，令人望而生敬。無疑地，當人一看到他的時候，顯然是一位十足道地，保存國粹的古老各士吧。不過，也許你不會相信，他曾經在戰前担任過許多學校的英文敎員，並且對於莎士比亞有相當的研究。戰前他是大夏大學的中文系的老敎授，抗戰初起，學校內遷，他因爲種種的關係，沒有隨學校到內地去，而蟄居海上，一貫的名士作風，不問不聞，雖然敵人是多次的威逼利誘，可是終不爲所動。過着淸寒的生活，一身淸白，熬過了這一連串冗長的時日。</p>
<p>大凡一個有學間的人，很多的是喜歡幽默而帶詼諧，在最近一次馬先生的演講中，我們可以看到他的幽默詼諧作風，以及他的藝術思想。</p>
<p>他說：「中國的藝術，是値得稱讚，而絕對不是人家隨便可以模仿的，因爲它具有一種獨立的典型，五千年來的燦爛文化，方始造成了這點結晶。」</p>
<p>「我們就拿文字來說，中國是採用的方體字，並非他國的拚音字所能比及的，是全世界所獨具的字型，中國的所以不會滅亡，也應當歸功於方體字的保存留傳；雖然我們在元淸兩朝亡了兩次國，可是文字非但沒有滅亡，反把異族同化了，而國家也就恢復過來。所以中國的藝術是値得自傲而且能够征服別人的。再說到國畫，外國人常常奇怪，而想學習，可是他們除非是從五千年以前學起，終是不容易學會的。」</p>
<p>當我們聽到了馬先生的這番話後，我想一般迷信洋化的人，多少總有一點領悟吧！</p>
<h3>路　（兩題）</h3>
<p>一　王建德</p>
<p>這是一條修長的路，望去，誰也見不到他的盡頭。</p>
<p>路面有的平坦，有的嶇崎，路旁有小草，也有荆棘。</p>
<p>每天，每天，多少人經過這裏，向着路的盡頭走去，花他們之間，有步伐輕快的，也有步伐學生的，有歡唱高歌的，也有哀號低吟的，但是，他們總是沒有停留，向這路的盡頭走去，誰也沒有見到過，有那一個走了回來。</p>
<p>不知自那一天起，我發現我自己也加入了他們的行列了，向前走去，我覺得這路不容易走，我想走回去，但是，在我的後面，正是一條修長的行列，擁擠不堪，我祗得拖起了沉重的步子，繼續前進。</p>
<p>現在，我感到了疲倦，得不到休息，得不到援助，更得不到友愛的溫情，因爲，誰都是這路上的旅人，都有一段遙遠的行程在前呢！</p>
<p>二　　明</p>
<p>路，伸展在前面，翻過了一座山頭，又轉過了一座，永遠地不會斷絕。她顯出驕傲的氣概，蔓佈在地球上每一個地方，以自己的身軀來担任溝通文化，商業的唯一偉大的工具。</p>
<p>路，最怕的是河流，當一條小河横斷他時，於是，路和橋便成了二個共患難的朋友。</p>
<p>我愛「路」，夏夜，我愛在無人的幽靜的路上躑躅，直到頭髮上濕濕地結起了露珠才止。</p>
<p>一路是被人踐踏出來的」，古哲人早這樣地說，荒山上本來是沒有路的，每天，獵人上去打獵，樵夫上去砍柴，永恒地跟隨蒲前人的足跡，漸漸地路出現了，路，被人踐踏出來了。</p>
<p>於是，我想到了一建國之路」之還未完成的緣故，就是大家都沒有同心協力地跟隨前人的脚印，走牠們剛成雛形的路呀！</p>
<p>每天，我對路　州禱；</p>
<p>讓我們走出一條康莊的「路」吧！……</p>
<h3>故聖約翰大學校長　美國卜舫濟博士行狀</h3>
<p>— 蔡正</p>
<p>先生氏卜，諱舫濟，美國紐約州人也。生自右族，稟性純　，問業哥倫比亞大學，年十九受文學士。文采旣耀，鑽硏益苦；尋轉紐約神學院爲神學士，博究精微，窮貫玄奧。家本富有，復致聲稱，而先生志不苟進，一心設敎；無憚跋涉，遠來中土，悉去舊服，改從我俗；始通語言，繼習經傳，並能上口，略無　滯。初聖公會有施主敎者，興學海上，相地得梵王演，聚徒三十九人，是爲聖約翰大學。草　之始以先生體仁足以長人，貞固足以幹事，遂以禮招，命長斯校。先生受事果毅，設施周詳，恪秉弗倦之訓，庶收善誘之效；時則士蔽所溺，習遠其用，先生閔焉，爰出所學，口譯相授，原始要終期於通曉。于是四方來者　，望形量附，聞聲響應；講習之樂，親若父子。五十年來，次第興設文理醫工諸院，拓地二百餘畝，造爲學舍；凡圖書館科學館實騐室體育室交誼室畢備，宏規大起，蔚爲上庠。先生自言一生爲校行乞，每歸故里，多方求索，挾資而至，輙有營建。然爾後功役繁興，亦多就地募財，國人感戴，輸將恐後矣。故總統黎公以先生化民成俗，功在我國，授三等嘉禾勳章。紐約三一學院，蘇格蘭愛丁堡大學，並贈神學博士。聖公會復徵爲主敎，綜理安徽全省教務，以許身學校，謝不赴任。年逾七十，躬治庶事，不稍寬假；可謂率履有常，始終若一者已。倭寇之變，先生在美，眷懷舊業，猶爲規畫；比事平歸來，睹　舍如昔，絃誦未輟，中情歡慰，溢于言表。謂左右曰：「返茲故宇，無異還家；終老是鄉，于願足矣！」何圖安居四月，驟　沈疾，以中華民國三十六年三月卒。春秋八十有三。聞赴之日，弟子數萬人遠致哀音，近臨喪次，僉謂哲人旣逝，德音猶存；宜推先生之風，共謀不朽之事。以正華同在師門，親承訓誨，命錄言行，上之史官，備采擇焉！</p>
<h3>黃山始信峯</h3>
<p>— 治源</p>
<p>黄山後海奇峯如劍戟森然，最著者爲始信峯，兩峯相去可二丈，石構聯之，橋頭有松，横伸一枝長與橋等，沿橋如闌，游者扶之以進，名接引松。</p>
<h3>葬歌</h3>

<p>本篇係希臘古詩之一，原載E·愛倫坡全集第十册，曾經愛氏英譯，爲愛氏介紹希臘文學作品之一，今特轉譯於後。</p>
<p>——譯者</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>將如何來讀這祭文？</p>
<p>將如何來唱這悲壯的歌？</p>
<p>爲這夭殤的，可愛的死者，</p>
<p>唱一支怎樣的鎭魂歌呢？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>她底友人們凝視着她，</p>
<p>凝視着她盛飾的屍架，</p>
<p>而且哭泣——喔！竟用虛僞的</p>
<p>眼淚來羞辱一個死去的女郞。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>他們愛她爲着她底錢財——</p>
<p>他們恨她爲着她底倨傲——</p>
<p>她漸漸地變爲孱弱，</p>
<p>他們愛她——因此她死去。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>他們吿訴我（當他們談論着</p>
<p>她「値錢的，錦繡的屍衣」）</p>
<p>說我底喉音已經低啞——</p>
<p>不應該再行歌唱。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>或是我底音調應該</p>
<p>轉成如此莊嚴的歌聲，</p>
<p>如此悲壯——如此哀傷，</p>
<p>這樣死者將不會感到悵惘。　（六）</p>
<p>如今她已走向天上</p>
<p>將年輕的希望帶在身旁。</p>
<p>而我爲死者的愛情沉醉，</p>
<p>她是我底新娘。</p>

<p>屬於死的——她死而横躺</p>
<p>周身都加上黨香，</p>
<p>眼裏綴上死的表記，</p>
<p>生命依舊　在她底髮上。</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>這樣我叩擊着棺木</p>
<p>高聲而滯長——含糊的旋律</p>
<p>在灰色的小屋裏應，着我底歌，</p>
<p>調和了我底歌唱。</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>妳死在妳生命底六月——</p>
<p>但妳死得並不神奇；</p>
<p>妳死得並不突然，</p>
<p>也沒有過平靜的死底空氣。</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>從無數的世俗的友人間</p>
<p>妳底生命與愛被碎裂，</p>
<p>摻入了天堂上的，無數的</p>
<p>天使們底永生的歡衆裏——</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>因此，對妳在今晚</p>
<p>將不再有鎭魂的歌唱，</p>
<p>只是歌舞妳，當妳飄昇，</p>
<p>用一支舊日的歡歌。</p>
<p>（一九四七年誌）</p>
<h3>哈薩族的故事</h3>
<p>— 朴</p>
<p>抗戰初期，靑海主席馬子香知道哈薩族的騎術很高明，民族性很强悍，很想把散處在靑海境內的這些少數同胞，固定下來，加以適當的訓練，貢戲於祖國的全面抗戰，又知道，哈薩族除他們的宗敎—回敎，平常是用帶在胸前的「經盒」代表的—以外，最寳愛的是婦女同子息，婦女不好辦，兒子呢？他在西寗辦了一個很好的小學，用敎育爲藉口，把他們的愛子收來作「人質」，然後逐步進行。</p>
<p>沒想會唱美妙的聲樂的哈薩族，樣子隻，質地很聰明，他們早已看透了這計劃，立刻打算着反抗。這時候，中央爲了建設大西北，派了一隊無綫電人才，向柴達木盆地進發，浦文鳳君便是奉派沿途招待的人。當他們一行幾十個人，搭帳篷在一個地方住宿，正碰到一天好月亮；酒肉之後，大家豪興頓發，不免豪歌大笑；忽然，從甚塵地方來了一個哈薩女人—這個高加索型的女人，恰合大家的脾買。</p>
<p>當時這些趁酒三分醉的草地旅行者們，同這一尤物幹了些甚麽事，我們是可以想像得出來的。豪典再加豪興，這女人也非常凑起兒，到了月落星稀，風高寐爽的時候，這女人是偸偸地溜掉，幾個帳篷裏的人，都在極度狂歡以後入了睡鄕，原就淸伏在草裏的哈薩們，突然脚枚疾走，擁到帳邊，抽出刀，先砍帳　，然後，以密集的隊伍，踩住四邊，一齊向中央砍！</p>
<p>「可憐」，派來陪我們的浦君說　「我，要不是忽然急了小便，跑出帳外來小解，早同着這許多國家多年培植的專門人才，一齊覺地藏王菩薩去了！吿訴各位」，他接着說，「一直跑到政府所在地，我還是赤身裸體的呢！當然，馬主席原有的計劃，就因爲這一來，竟然沒再進行！」</p>
<p>這次的新疆事變，據說就是哈薩爲首的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>吉普賽人</h3>
<p>— 蔡雪</p>
<p>印度似乎是吉普賽人的故居，他們所說的話，便是印度方言中的一種，由梵文變化而來。他們是達拉吠丁人的後裔，曾給阿蘭人征服，做過他們的奴隸，大約在耶蘇降生後，才脫離了羈絆，去度他們的流浪生活。</p>
<p>他們在巴爾幹半島，住了好幾百年，學會了許多做生意的門徑。語言增加了不少希臘字和斯拉夫字。宗敎信仰和習慣，大受影響，連原有的寮敎也放棄了。因爲住在巴爾幹很久，所以有人誤會這是他們祖居</p>
<p>吉普賽人逐漸增多。巴爾幹的貴族，又把他們當作奴隸看待，伐薪，開礦，甚至於燒飯，領小孩子，什麽事情都要他們去做。直到十九世紀，他們還有在羅馬尼亞爲奴的。但他們愛自由的天性太强烈了，不肯爲奴的都逃至山區一帶，一隊隊自立酋長，幹那打家劫舍的勾當，提到的當然要砍頭，可是布置得也相當周密。後來情形更惡化了，不得不出走西歐。領導他們的，仍是酋長，打扮得很神氣，只是手下的人，住在蓬帳內，不免還要偸偸摸摸。他們自稱爲虔誠的基督敎徒，結土耳其人從埃及趕出來的。吉普賽人的名稱，即起源於此。</p>
<p>他們到過巴黎，蔓延到英國和西班牙，連挪威，瑞典，芬蘭，也是他們的世界了，起初大家不甚注意，後來漸起恐慌。普魯士首先禁止他們入境，否則處以絞刑。但他們東奔西走，自會尋覓安身之所。其實他們也是很可愛的，脾氣竟有點像小孩子。祗有逼得他們走頭無路的時候，才會發生危險。奧大利曾改變態度，好好地去待他們，想替他們設立一塊殖民地。計劃雖未成功，但各國也逐漸把歧視他們的心理改變了。</p>
<p>十八世紀之末，有德人名格里曼者，著書立說，證明吉普賽人是從印度遷來的。於是人們才對於這種輕視已久的民族感到興趣，開始硏究他們的生活。小說家和戲劇家也用他們來做題材，描寫其流浪生活，自由自在，不受拘束，這樣友誼的抬舉，把吉普賽人弄得莫名其妙，然而因此疑懼之心，確已消减不少。不過他們中間，仍有喜歡過那飄泊無定的生活的，除非在隆冬天氣，暫時安居室內，一到春暖，又都駕車遠征了。</p>
<p>對付吉普賽人，你如果用眞誠去待他們，他們也會用眞誠來待你。他們中間，也有醫師，律師，工程師，美術師，人才濟濟尤其對於音樂跳舞，更具特長。據警察調査，吉普賽人從不曾犯過大案，祗是些細小事故，有的竟是無理取鬧而已。</p>
<p>戰前，很有人想把他們現代化起來，開學校，辦報紙，設戲院，成績都很不差。在戰時，他們也異常活動，抵抗德人，掩護俘虜。所以德人在安巨威，一夜工夫，殺却了一萬多吉普賽人。據說在一九三九年，歐洲的吉普賽人約在一百五十萬名左右，現在剩下的已不很多了。在法國的吉普賽人，正在呼籲，要大家全部團結起來。</p>
<h3>養鳥與門鳥</h3>
<p>— 艾尹選</p>
<p>——且看鄭板橋的看法</p>
<p>本市城隍廟近來舉行一次黄鳥競賽會，參加的縣鎭有蘇州，常熟，無錫，杭州，嘉興，湖州，羅店導二十七個單位，黄鳥有六百多頭，可見易好此道者，是非常多的。</p>
<p>照說，養鳥可以算爲一閑雅之事。鳥底婉轉歌聲，美艷羽毛，玲瓏而且活潑的姿態，也的確能快人心意，悅人耳目，但若把鳥養得肥肥的，專用來打架，視其　羽傷足，自相殘殺以爲樂，則未免有些殘忍。</p>
<p>鬥鳥和鬥鷄鬥蟋蟀是一類的玩意，自幾歲的孩童到白髮老者，都有愛好的，以之作爲傾家蕩藍的豪賭，更是常事。城隍廟這次鬥鳥，據參加競賽的鳥主說，並不賭錢，純爲地方掙面子爭光。所謂掙面子爭光，實因好勝而起；人自然都有好勝心，但是好勝心擴張的時候，往往就是種殘忍的表現，鬥島便是個例子。</p>
<p>認眞說來，養島於樊籠，已是極不自然的，鄭板橋對他底弟弟談起養鳥說：「平生最不　籠中島。我圖娛樂，彼在囚牢，何情何理？而必屈物之性以適吾之性乎？」其後又補充道：「所云不得籠中養鳥，而予又未嘗不愛鳥，但養之有道耳。欲養鳥，莫如多種樹，使　屋數百枝，扶疏茂密，爲鳥國鳥家。將旦時，睡夢初醒，聽一片啁啾，如雲門咸池之奏，及披衣而起，類面漱口啜茗，見其揚　振彩，倐往倐來，目不暇給，固非一籠一羽之樂而已。」（見板橋家書）這應是盡善盡美的養鳥之道了，不說是「愛物」「愛生」的話，就是這樣也是種詩的情趣，也是種生活藝術。</p>
<p>其實，宇宙之大，儘多可爲之事，蘇東坡說得好：「留意於物，往往成趣」。推廣興趣，則天地之間，無不爲我所喜，又何必專事養鳥？更何必專事鬥鳥呢？</p>
<h3>路明在「甦鳳記」一片中</h3>
<h3>流行的都市病</h3>
<p>— 巴克</p>
<p>防疫委員會十三日發表本市流行性的腦脊髓膜炎和天花，正在蔓延，上月份患者腦脊髓膜炎一百十三人，天花四百五十八人，本月十日止，患前者十三人，後者一百十五人。這兩個病症的統計大槪祗是防疫會本身的防治統計，在蔓延的深廣看來，恐怕事實上遠逾此數。我們知道兩病對幼核尤其容易傳染，就筆者所知，鄰近幼孩患上述兩病而死亡者已不止一人這個現象實在需要注意。</p>
<p>不過這兩病還祗流行性而已，至於肺癆和性病那更是都市病，近來防癆會警吿市民防治T·B·募款助醫。本報也舉行免費防癆檢査，這是頗具意義，而有遠見的。</p>
<p>都市病的如此嚴重，自然與人口與生活環境有關，除性病大致爲四萬餘妓女所傳播外，都市人口的密集，空氣的混濁，居住的不合條件以及下水道間題是T·B·以及流行性病症的客觀原因。我們從都市的衛生民族的健康上着眼，對這樣流行的都市病，實在頗具深憂。</p>
<p>然則當我們由流行性的病征移眼到社會性的都市前幾天時，我們又覺得後者的蔓延更爲深廣，後者的危害更爲可畏，覺得這是比流行性的病症更需要搶先防治的。</p>
<p>這些一社會性的流行一病，無他，失業，勞資糾紛和動盪不安是也。目前失業現象已比去年更爲嚴重，不論企業店號和機關類皆裁遣員工，如近之銀樓業的停業，如中華書局印鈔工人的解散等，至於勞資糾紛，自生活指數解凍後，因折扣及底薪問題糾葛頗，多，更使吾人憂心的那就是罷課遊行等動盪不安之社會現象了。近知本市各界領袖組社會安全促進會，謀社會之安定，解決失業等問題，我們希望眞能够實際展開工作，今日之社會性的都市病，予以根治，已屬刻不容緩了。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「我老盧還要做一個人，嚥不下這口氣」！盧跛子仍然毫無顧忌地大聲喊呌着：「我決定不逃了！我也不願意再領着人家逃！誰有勇氣的，請跟着我走！讓我們迎上去，跟在軍隊一起，好歹也跟矮鬼拼一下！總比這樣骯骯髒髒，醃醃攢攢地死在公路上，火車裏，乾脆一些」！</p>
<p>盧前這一大篇出人意外的演說，差不多把劇圖裏每一個人都激動了，倒有一大半立刻舉起手來，高喊「我跟你走，老盧」！其餘也都躍躍欲試，只躊踟着在前方自己能够做些什麼事。</p>
<p>「人各有志，我老盧決不勉强」。盧跛子又補上了一句。</p>
<p>「很好，很好」。祝兆年連點頭。「國家弄到了這種地步，也祗能人各爲戰了。我把緋緋送到南丹以後，說不定也會立刻回來，跟你們做一起。一直想嘗嘗日本三八式步槍的滋味，也許這倒是個機會」！</p>
<p>「這樣更好了，我們準等着你」！盧跛子和好幾個年輕人都這樣興奮地喊。</p>
<p>老祝取起地上的皮箱，又向一瘸一拐在奔跑的盧跛子的背影看了幾眼；他覺得很高興，這樣一個懷着濃重的憂鬱感的早熟的靑年畢竟還不曾失掉他原有的血性，但同時他又覺得戚然不歡，在這樣各種條件都不足的情形下，這許多年輕人不顧一切，回身返鬥，其結果是可以不用推想的。</p>
<p>是他背上馱着的緋緋的轉側驚醒了他，使他終於提起沉重的脚步，開始望站外走去；好幾個人想送他一程，都給他辭謝了。</p>

<h3>Clearing Out Remnant Communists in Siping City; Xiong and Du Reward the Garrison Troops; National Army Forces on the Eastern Section of the Jichang Railway Join Up</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] The brave garrison of Siping completely eliminated the remnant communist forces in the city by noon on the 17th. Upon hearing the news of the great victory, the citizens of Shenyang were all elated and excited, and many lit firecrackers to celebrate. Director Xiong and Commander Du specially rewarded the garrison troops with ten million yuan. The Provincial and Municipal Councils and the Northeast National Assembly Representatives Association also sent telegrams to General Ming Ren and Chairman Liu Cangdong to express their condolences and prepared a large number of comfort items, which were scheduled to be transported by plane on the 18th. It is reported that the battle on the outskirts of Siping City has been going on for seven days now, with fierce fighting day and night, which has never been seen in the Northeast in the past.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] The fighting in Siping on the 16th was fierce all night. The Communist Third Division advanced from the northeastern corner of the urban area, while the Sixteenth and Eighteenth Divisions launched a fierce attack from the Siping Railway Bureau area in the northwest corner, employing a wave-like offensive. The casualties were heavy, with corpses everywhere. The 17th saw the climax of the battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fanyang, 17th] Siping Telephone: Siping, which had been quiet for a while, resumed intense artillery and hand-to-hand combat on the morning of the 16th. At 8 o'clock, four regiments of the Communist army suddenly advanced into the Nanwu Dao Street area in the city. The communist soldiers were all carrying bombs and incendiary devices, and several houses were bombed and caught fire. The National Army quickly gathered its main force and completely annihilated the invading communist troops. At noon, another regiment of the Communist army broke into the city, but it has been surrounded by the National Army and is being annihilated. In this battle, more than a thousand communist soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than two hundred were captured alive.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] Communist troops on the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway (Zhongchang Railway) approached Dashiqiao on the night of the 16th.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] After being appointed as the Songbei Pacification Commander, Ma Zhanshan has also been ordered to summon his old troops and reorganize three cavalry armies. It is reported that one army has already been formed.</p>
<h3>National Army Troops Advance Southward on Two Routes; Threat to Tianjin is Lifted; Communist Troops in Eastern Hebei Constantly Harass</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th] Communist troops on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway (Jinpu Railway) have begun to retreat. The National Army is advancing southward on two routes. One route is advancing on the front line and has already entered Daxiaobozhuang and Chaozongqiao, which are under the jurisdiction of Jinghai County on the north bank of the Jian River. Several thousand communist soldiers have completely retreated. The other route is pointing south along the railway, crossing Chenguantun. The main force of the communist troops in that area is fleeing westward to Dacheng area. The military has announced that the threat to Tianjin has been lifted. Communist troops in eastern Tianjin are still appearing frequently. Yesterday, several thousand communist troops gathered across the Hai River from Tanggu and had contact with nearby salt police. In addition, more than 3,000 communist troops under the command of Wu Hong of Ninghe County, northwest of Tanggu, occupied Chijian Beach on the 16th, attempting to approach the Xinhe River in Tanggu and disrupt traffic. Shengfang in western Tianjin was attacked by three or four thousand communist troops yesterday afternoon. After the National Army counterattacked, the communist troops collapsed and retreated on the morning of the 17th, leaving hundreds of corpses behind.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Regarding the battle on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, the two armies are still facing each other south of Chenguantun. The National Army has already withdrawn from all strongholds south of it. Relevant military officials here flew to Tianjin yesterday to participate in a military conference presided over by Sun Lianzhong. The powerful units transported to Tianjin from various lines have arrived at their designated locations, and a counterattack to the south will begin on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 17th] The flames of war on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway are spreading northward. The military has confirmed that the main force of Nie Rongzhen's troops has occupied the railway side between Jinghai and Qingxian, with a force of more than 10,000 people. Yesterday, they successively captured Tangjiatun, Renguantun, and Xingji. Jinghai and Qingxian are currently under siege, and the fighting is fierce. Related parties stated that the main forces of the communist troops in western Hebei, central Hebei, and Taihang have all moved eastward. A large number of communist troops have also occupied the triangular area of Ping, Jin, and Bao. The judgment on their actions is: (1) to echo the main battle in the Northeast, emphasizing mobility and harassment; (2) to threaten Pingjin; (3) to cut off various railway lines and obstruct military deployment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] According to news received on the evening of the 16th, although the battle on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is still taking place south of Chenguantun, which is 60 kilometers away from Tianjin, the strength of the National Army has become stronger and stronger after repeated deployments in recent days. It is expected that there will be a major development in the war situation in three or four days. According to the military authorities, the main force of the invading communist troops has been identified as Nie Rongzhen's troops, with a total number of no more than 30,000 to 40,000 people. The Tianjin Garrison Command announced that starting from the 17th, the curfew time will be advanced to 9:00 PM every night, and ships entering and leaving all rivers will stop sailing from 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 17th] More than a thousand communist troops in Haiyang Town, northwest of Qinhuangdao, have been attacking the National Army strongholds on the outskirts of the island for days. The National Army Corps in Tangshan is currently conducting a sweeping operation to encircle and suppress them. In addition, the Sixty-first Regiment and the Qian County Detachment of the Communist Army fiercely attacked Changli County on the 14th and 15th. They were defeated and retreated westward at noon on the 17th, and the National Army is pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Full Line of the Beining Railway Resumes Traffic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The steel bridge near Luogukou between Beiping and Tianjin that was destroyed has been repaired. The Beining Line, which had been cut off for several days, resumed full-line traffic on the 17th.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Regarding the various railway lines centered on Beiping, except for minor damage to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway last night, the rest were all fine. The Guaimaqiao near Nangangwa on the Pinghan Line was damaged again on the morning of the 17th. There was also damage between Liangxiang and Shidian, and between Liulihe and Yongle. The southward military personnel still passed through Changxindian, and the northbound trains passed through Yongle. The Pingsui Line was fine, and the Pinggu Line was still open to Shunyi.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The person in charge of China Airlines said that the company has decided to find ways to increase the number of flights on the Beiping-Tianjin Line from today onwards.

In addition, the company has decided that if the number of passengers in various places exceeds five flights (100 people) or more per day, they can call the Shanghai headquarters to request the dispatch of aircraft to add flights.</p>
<h3>National Army Counterattacks in Shandong; Restores Positions of the Previous Week; More Strongholds Recovered in Northern Henan</h3>

<h3>Northern Travelogue Three; Wind and Sand in Huai Ren Tang</h3>
<p>By Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>(Picture: Wangfujing Street, Beiping)</p>
<p>The wind and sand bring迷蒙, and the Great Wall could not stop this侵袭. We southerners are quite unaccustomed to this kind of confusion that fills the sky and the earth. At this moment, it is even more symbolic of chaos, entanglement, and unclearity.</p>
<p>The Pingjin Railway line is interrupted every two or three days. Tongxian seems to be a duckweed floating on the sea. A guard platoon leader at the Xiyuan Airport pointed to the mountains far behind and said to me that there are small groups of 出没 thirty miles away. This year, even kind men and women did not dare to pay their respects to the gods at the Miaofengshan incense meeting on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month.</p>
<p>The people of Beiping are very calm. Although everyone knows that they seem to be in a笼城, they are used to living in the wind and sand.</p>
<p>I arrived in Beiping during the peak of the student潮. No one dared to predict what would happen in this student city with a glorious historical tradition of student movements. But the result was surprisingly satisfactory. There were only a few minor conflicts during the three weeks of continuous turmoil. Beiping's students are the best in the country. The various aspects shown by Beiping's students in this turmoil were not more intense than those in other places. People may ask who created this satisfactory result. Anyone in Beiping can answer you: it is General Li Zongren and his Chief of Staff, Wang Hongshao. This is a fair judgment of society. I dare not assume what the evolution of the situation would be if General Li Zongren were not responsible for the當局, because this assumption is superfluous and wasteful.</p>
<p>Students are, after all, students. General Li Zongren commanded the three armies and dominated the battlefield during the Battle of Xuzhou. He knew how to fight and how to command troops. Now, he also understands practical politics. He did not treat students and soldiers the same. He was kind-hearted and applied情 and理 with tolerance, and the result was naturally a state of self-comfort and comfort to others.</p>
<p>One windy and sandy day, a friend and I went to the行辕 in Zhongnanhai to visit him. I said that old novels often provide stories of coincidences between people's names and place names. Zhongnanhai has居仁堂 and怀仁堂, but now it is the office of the Director of the行辕. I am afraid that this was not expected by Mr. Li at the beginning.</p>
<p>During the most tense period of the student unrest, Hu Shih, Lu Zhiwei, Li Zheng and others were frequent guests in the Hall of Grace. Li not only won the sincere cooperation of the university presidents with his sincere能度, but also supported the opinions of the university presidents with concrete actions. However, this vast and quiet garden made General Li Delin feel a sense of national郁闷. He had his own心曲, perhaps the water flowing潺溝前 can潺沟地他 流鸣!</p>
<p>Mayor He Siyuan is also a frequent guest in Huai Rentang. He has been in office for less than a year. As far as I know, his greatest achievement is the work of clearing the穢土 (garbage) in the urban area. According to reports, the 穢土 accumulated in Beiping for more than ten years was completely cleared in two months and thirteen days, totaling 2,100,973 tons of 穢土 cleared. The average daily mobilization was 188,200 people, mobilizing a total of 5,540 cars, 4,315 手車, 420 trams, and 68 train carriages. The cost was more than 1.12 billion yuan. The 秽土 accumulated for more than ten years; once cleared, it made the city of Beiping look brand new, and even more able to show the beauty of this园林化都市.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. He Siyuan once expected himself to be a civilian mayor, but some people said that he was very good at being an official. In today's Chinese society, mentioning the word "官" almost represents sin. This popular concept is the most dangerous and can destroy everything. In this kind of atmosphere, everyone is fearful and keeps themselves clean and good. Under the same atmosphere, good public servants are even抹煞 by everyone. Officials have their official duties. Being good at being an official means that they cannot abandon their official duties at the very least. Therefore, being good at being an official should not be considered a bad thing. If a person wants to be good and strives for public reputation, at least the motivation is not bad, and society should not hesitate to give encouragement. Because rewarding people for being good, the negative meaning is贬责 bad people.</p>
<p>Mr. He Siyuan is outspoken and豪爽. His speech at the founding meeting of the Manchu Cultural Promotion Association in Zhongshan Park was脍炙故都人士之口, and the Manchu compatriots in particular were satisfied. However, sometimes, the temperament is a bit impatient. Once, he convened representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, trade unions, farmers' associations, and other units to give instructions. In the middle of one paragraph, he said:</p>
<p>Now everyone is骂 so-called: "是官皆责," but even if you are greedy, you have to have an opportunity! And the newspapers are also scolding貪汚, which is like a person who only looks at his own茅房奥, the kitchen is not clean, and feels煩. If there are guests, let them sit in the living room, and what they see is not just as beautiful? So it is best for us to 應客, and not only look at the 厠所 and 厨房.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people put forward a "客應政治论" slogan.</p>
<p>This pair of important northern towns, the emperors of all generations, are安谧 in the inside, and their scope is limited to thirty miles from the city, even in the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the city, you can always smell the gunpowder around you. One day, the following news appeared in the society column of the newspaper:</p>
<p>A young woman lives in the apartment of a Swiss businessman at No. 137 South Entrance of Wangfujing Street. The interior equipment is luxurious, and the demeanor is also very阔绰. The hotel music inspection督导组 received a密报 saying that the young woman is a Japanese woman, or a person engaged in espionage work, and sent Wang Chen, the second组长, to check. The young woman spoke fluent Chinese. She claimed to be named Yang Huiming and was a译 for the Americans in the Military Mediation Department, and had also served in the Changchun Forward Command Post. Her original籍 was from Fujian, but when she asked her mother and sister-in-law again, they could only answer in Japanese-style Chinese, so the three mothers and daughters were 解送 to the稽查處 for interrogation.</p>
<p>Beiping is in迷离.</p>
<p>The wind and sand is a product of nature. Friends say that the momentum in autumn and winter is even more alarming. I hope that人事 will not use it as a symbol, and maintain the simplicity, purity, and grandeur of the northern mountains, rivers, customs, and people, and seek progress in stability. However, this is only a wish.</p>
<p>籠城, how can we 修谈政情!</p>

<h3>Far East Economic Conference: Second Day; Delegates from Various Countries Deliver Speeches; Philippine Delegate Elected Vice Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its second day of meetings yesterday. The meeting began at 10:30 AM. According to the agenda, the fourth item to be discussed was the election of the Vice Chairman of the Conference. However, because the Soviet delegate, Mr. Stetsenko, repeatedly proposed at the previous day's meeting that this election should be held after the delegates from each country had delivered their speeches, the American delegate, Mr. Davis, suggested yesterday morning that agenda item five, "Determination of Provisional Agenda," should be discussed before item four. This would include short speeches from delegates who wished to present reports on the economic surveys of their respective countries. This proposal was seconded by the Soviet delegate and passed by the conference. Chairman Jiang Tingfu then invited the Indian delegate to speak first. However, the Indian delegate, Mr. Nehru, stated that he was not prepared and requested to speak in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The British delegate, Mr. Crowe, then delivered a speech, followed by delegates from Thailand, France, Australia, and other countries. The morning session then adjourned.</p>
<p>The session continued at 3 PM with speeches from delegates from India, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. At this point, the speeches of the ten national delegates were completed, and the election of the Vice Chairman began. The French delegate, Mr. Mourinon, first nominated the Philippine delegate, Mr. Guaderno. He stated that Mr. Guaderno was highly talented and experienced and was suitable for the position of Vice Chairman. He was not only a lawyer but also a financier who had served as the Deputy Manager of the Philippine National Bank and was currently the Philippine Minister of Finance. This proposal was seconded by the Thai delegate. However, the Soviet delegate, Mr. Stetsenko, expressed his dissent: "I have stated earlier that the Soviet delegation arrived in Shanghai late and has not had sufficient time to consider the candidate for Vice Chairman. As far as I know, the candidate for Vice Chairman was decided outside the meeting by other delegates before the conference opened, but the delegates from our country did not participate. Therefore, I am not bound by this decision and should nominate another candidate. In addition, the qualifications of the Vice Chairman should be considered. In addition to the economic qualifications mentioned by the French delegate, attention should also be paid to geographical and other relationships. However, since the other delegates have now made a different decision, the Soviet delegate can only remain silent on this matter."</p>
<p>The Thai delegate then proposed that the discussion be closed. The Chairman then announced that the Philippine delegate, Mr. Guaderno, had been elected Vice Chairman of the conference. Mr. Guaderno then rose to express his gratitude and thanked the conference on behalf of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The conference adjourned at 5 PM. This morning's meeting is still scheduled to be held at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>The Research and Review Subcommittee on Provisional Rules of Procedure of the conference held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the lounge on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>The speeches of the delegates from various countries are recorded below:</p>
<p>British Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Crowe stated briefly: "The organization of this conference still needs to be gradually developed. It is not appropriate to make the task too burdensome when starting work. The main task at present is still to exchange information so that various proposals can have a solid foundation. I hope that all countries can be open and honest and provide each other with information. At the same time, the delegates of each country can strictly adhere to the scope and not seek irrelevant information." Mr. Crowe also stated: "The holding of this conference in Shanghai is of great significance. China and Shanghai suffered great losses during the war. It is appropriate to discuss reconstruction plans here today."</p>
<p>Thai Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Arsanayuq Ditthi stated: "The Thai authorities deeply hope to establish close ties with this conference in order to improve Thailand's economic situation. Since the Japanese occupied Thailand, it has suffered extreme destruction in recent years. At present, transportation, industry, and agriculture all need to be restored, and there are many difficulties. Although we are in all kinds of difficulties, we are still willing to take on a part of the responsibility for the economic reconstruction of Asia and make our best efforts to establish close ties with various countries."</p>
<p>French Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Mourinon, in his speech, expressed the gratitude of the French delegation to the Chinese government for allowing the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference to be held in China. He expressed the French delegation's determination to cooperate to the best of its ability in the main work of the conference: research and investigation.</p>
<p>Australian Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Wootton (Deputy Delegate) stated in his speech: "One of the tasks of this commission is to seek long-term economic cooperation plans in order to submit concrete recommendations to the Economic Council." Mr. Wootton also stated: "Economic cooperation between countries does not necessarily have to have a fixed plan. Under both state-owned and commercial modes, it is hoped that there can be various similar methods. When studying these plans, this commission should not use political theory as the principle of decision."</p>
<p>Indian Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru stated in his speech: "In order to establish a new economic foundation for Asia and the Far East, the first thing that deserves our attention is to promote international cooperation and realize true democracy, freedom, and equality. This responsibility should be fulfilled by the United Nations." Although the political backgrounds of the countries in Asia and the Far East are different, the goal of rebuilding the economic foundation and improving the lives of the people is the same. At this conference, after studying the various reports and proposals, we should seek a perfect economic plan for adoption and implementation by the United Nations.</p>
<p>US Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Davis stated briefly in his speech: "The US delegation has three main points: (1) The conference should first comprehensively study the working reports of the various subcommittees in detail. (2) Formulate methods for rebuilding the economic foundation of Asia and the Far East. (3) Study the needs of each country separately and focus on practical work." He finally added: "Since we firmly believe in the importance of economic reconstruction, we must not neglect the improvement of transportation, the increase of food production, and international trade, as these all have a great impact on economic improvement."</p>
<p>Soviet Delegate</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr. Stetsenko made a clear statement on the Soviet Union's position. The main points are as follows: (1) In order to implement the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter, this commission must respect the sovereignty of each country, absolutely not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and, in particular, must act in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and not take any action against any country without the permission of the country concerned. (2) This commission must pay close attention to the assistance given by each country to friendly countries and not use assistance as political pressure. (3) The Soviet Union will do its best to assist other countries in their reconstruction while also implementing its socialist economic organization and its five-year plan. (4) In the work of striving for peaceful reconstruction, the main goal is to prevent reactionary forces and fascism from having the opportunity to create war again. (5) The task of this commission is to assist countries with abundant resources to develop their productive forces and achieve their economic independence. At the same time, this commission must also assist these countries in their political and national independence.</p>
<h3>Raising the Status of Women: Working Hard for Equality; The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Far East Economic Commission conference received a declaration from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This declaration was proposed by fifteen women representatives of the United Nations Economic Commission, each representing a different country, demanding that women obtain equality in all sectors: political, economic, civil, social, and educational, as well as improvements in their lives. The declaration stated: "Since entering the 20th century, the promotion of women's rights has been noticed and valued by all parties. Today, countries are increasingly promoting the movement to seek equal rights and equal status for men and women. In some countries, women have already obtained equal rights with men in politics, economics, and human rights, but in many countries, women have not yet achieved liberation and equality, and the work of promoting the women's rights movement is not progressing effectively. In order to achieve the goal of raising the status of women, the United Nations calls on all countries around the world to work hard for equality between men and women."</p>
<h3>I Need a Stable Life: Li Qian States the Hopes of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>The Deputy Delegate of our country, Mr. Li Qian, stated in his speech: "Before making my main remarks, I would like to first state a few points, that the views of the Chinese delegation can be said to be completely consistent with those expressed by the other delegates. The Chinese delegation strongly agrees with the scope of work proposed by the Australian and American delegates, and the principles of work proposed by the Soviet delegate are also what the Chinese delegation wants to suggest.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese delegation is very honored that Dr. Jiang Tingfu of the Chinese delegation has been elected as the Chairman of the Conference, but the Chinese delegation has lost a representative who can truly speak for the people. I have no choice but to express some opinions on behalf of Dr. Jiang.</p>
<p>What I want to report to you is the hope of the Chinese people. Looking back on the Japanese invasion of Asia, China was its target. Although it later invaded Southeast Asia and other countries, the battlefields it opened up were all centered on China. According to surveys, the number of soldiers and civilians who died in China due to the war is estimated at 12.1 million, 439 cities were damaged, of which 43 were almost completely destroyed, and the loss of public and private property amounted to approximately 5.85 billion US dollars. This shows the significant losses suffered by China due to the war, and the extent of economic destruction is unimaginable. The post-war economy is still facing many difficulties. Although it has been almost two years since the victory, recovery will not be easy in the next few years. China, like other countries, is experiencing inflation, which has caused political and social instability.</p>
<p>What the Chinese people need most today is a stable life and increased production. We hope that the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference can formulate a plan to help China become self-reliant, promote production, and achieve the simple goal of "improving life."</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, (1) production must be organized reasonably, and (2) goods must be distributed and circulated reasonably. To this end, the Chinese delegation specifically recommends the following points: (1) Increase agricultural production, especially food production, and cooperate with international food organizations to avoid setting up too many institutions. (2) Promote a balanced industrial production system to achieve reasonable procedures. (3) Improve transportation. (4) Promote international trade in the Far East and worldwide.</p>
<p>The Chairman said in his speech yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) that whether politics can be clarified and society can be stabilized all depends on the economy. Since society is unstable, it reflects the importance of economic construction. Therefore, China sincerely hopes that the conference can contribute valuable opinions and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Dutch Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Staesgen stated: "I am very pleased that this conference can be held in Shanghai, as China suffered great hardships during the war." He also said: "The Netherlands and Indonesia also suffered significant destruction during the war, and the Netherlands needs a lot of external assistance for its domestic construction. I sincerely hope that this conference can decide on a plan and method for building the economy."</p>
<p>Philippine Delegate</p>
<p>Mr. Guaderno stated briefly: "The delegates from various countries have expressed many opinions, and I agree with them all, so I will not repeat them. But I can guarantee that the Philippine Republic can give the greatest cooperation to this conference. I also hope that in a short period of time, the Philippine delegation can submit a research proposal on the scope of the meeting to the conference for discussion."</p>

<h3>Japan's Priority Reparations Only 1.56 Million Tons; China Gets Half, 780,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to Chinese sources, the 30% of priority reparations based on temporary measures amount to 3.5 million tons. Mr. Li Dechen, a Chinese reparations representative, stated that this figure is an exaggeration. The total tonnage of temporary reparations has been revised several times. The first stipulation was in September of last year, totaling 12 million tons. In November, it was reduced to 5.5 million tons. Before January, the General Headquarters Reparations Executive Office re-fixed it at 5.2 million tons. The 30% priority reparations based on temporary measures totaled 1.56 million tons, not 3.5 million tons as reported. China received half of the priority reparations, totaling 780,000 tons, not 1.75 million tons. The scope of reparations will be decided by the Far East Commission, which includes 13 industries and over 1,000 factories. The main reasons for the delay in the relocation of reparations are: (1) The Soviet Union removed some machinery and equipment from Northeast China, which should be regarded as reparations, but the Soviet Union insisted that it was a victory, so there was a conflict of opinion. (2) The ratio of reparations is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The investigation of machine tool factories in northern Japan by our country's Reparations Committee has ended. The members of the committee visited seven factories in Niigata and Toyama during their visit to northern Japan.

They will continue to inspect factories in Nanto next week, including about ten factories located in and around Tokyo. According to the committee, 29 factories were inspected this time, and 13 factories were inspected at the beginning of this year.</p>

<p>Determining the Geling and Nanping Areas</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th]</p>
<p>The Central Government previously planned to take advantage of the scenic beauty of West Lake and instructed the Hangzhou Municipal Government to find a site to establish a national park. Following an inspection by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, it was determined that a portion of the Geling Mountain area and the entirety of the Nanping Mountain area could be used as a national park. The ideal form is a forest park. Surveying of the terrain in the Nanping Mountain area has already been assigned and is scheduled for completion within the year, in order to provide a basis for concrete plans.</p>

<h3>Facing the Subtle Relationship Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace delivered a speech in Washington yesterday, advocating that the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union meet to eliminate all differences between the two countries in order to avoid the outbreak of a third world war. He also proposed six concrete measures: (1) If the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can meet frankly and discuss everything, it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on any issue; (2) The Soviet Union should also be able to share a portion of the vast oil fields controlled by Britain and the U.S. in the Near East; (3) The U.S. should ban international arms sales in order to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of controlling atomic energy; (4) Abolish the Truman Doctrine and its armed forces, and the policy that the Soviet Union considers hostile towards governments; (5) The U.S. should also provide credit loans to the Soviet Union for post-war reconstruction in exchange for the Soviet Union's raw materials for American industrial production.</p>
<p>Wallace's proposal, made at a time when U.S.-Soviet relations are tense, is worth studying from any angle. We believe that the core of the post-war world problem lies in the reversal of U.S.-Soviet relations. The Allies won the victory, but failed to create a successful peace. The only crux is that the U.S. and the Soviet Union not only cannot cooperate sincerely and jointly devote themselves to creating world peace, but instead, they are mutually suspicious and stand in opposition everywhere. The breakdown of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference is the superficial manifestation of the U.S.-Soviet conflict reaching its peak, making everyone believe that if there is no hope for improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, there can be no peace in the post-war world. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world earnestly hope that the politicians of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will use their political wisdom to eliminate all misunderstandings and suspicions between the two countries, and be able to cooperate sincerely and jointly devote themselves to the creation of world peace, in order to achieve the lofty ideals envisioned by the United Nations organization. However, observing the words and deeds of the U.S. and the Soviet Union after the war, it is not difficult to prove that the two countries have parted ways and are moving further and further apart. Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson delivered a speech to students at Middleton University on the 15th, condemning the Soviet Union for adopting policies that violate international understanding and world recovery, and pointed out the concrete facts of the Soviet Union's obstruction of world peace: (1) In the Far East: The Soviet Union moved away the industrial equipment of the nine northeastern provinces of China, maintained its control over the port of Dalian, and opposed the unification of Korea; (2) In the Middle East, the Soviet Union incited the northern province of Azerbaijan to secede from Iran and encouraged Greece's neighbors to support the Greek Communist armed rebellion against the Greek government; (3) In the Balkans, a coup d'état suddenly occurred in Hungary when the treaty was being implemented, and the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility; (4) In Germany and Austria, the Soviet Union did not hesitate to violate the Potsdam Agreement, stubbornly obstructed the unification of the German economy, and tried every possible means to hinder the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty. Acheson's remarks can be regarded as the reason why the American people are dissatisfied with the Soviet Union. On the Soviet side, there are also many things about the words and deeds of the U.S. government that they are not satisfied with. Soviet newspapers, magazines, and radio stations often publish remarks attacking the current policies of the U.S., which can be summarized as follows: (1) The U.S. maintains the secret of atomic energy and refuses to fully disclose it, harboring the intention of threatening other countries with atomic energy, making the Soviet Union feel uneasy; (2) The U.S. still wants to maintain its military bases all over the world after the war, no less than having the ambition of imperialists to control the whole world; (3) The U.S. uses financial diplomacy to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries in Europe and Asia; especially the aid to Greece and Turkey is entirely aimed at the Soviet Union; (4) The Truman Doctrine clearly has the intention of preventing communism and opposing the Soviet Union, which should not be tolerated by the Soviet Union; (5) The U.S. adopts a lenient policy towards defeated countries, which is especially opposed by the Soviet Union, believing that the U.S. is no less than adopting a policy of supporting Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The suspicion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not only deepening, but the division of the post-war world into two worlds is also becoming increasingly clear. Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover even advocated that the U.S. should abandon the Soviet Union and conclude a peace treaty with Germany and Japan alone. Although this extreme proposal was not adopted by the U.S. diplomatic authorities, it was taken very seriously by U.S. public opinion. The general psychology of the American people can also be seen. However, as long as people appeal to common sense and conscience, they will all understand the seriousness of the post-war world situation. If no attempt is made to reverse the adverse trend between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, not only will there be no peace in the world, but mankind will move towards a new war one day, which is approaching "heaven." This is not intentionally alarmist, but a definite feeling we have gained from facing reality squarely. The most noteworthy feature of the European economic cooperation plan recently proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is not that the U.S. continues to aid European countries suffering from war disasters in order to prevent their social economy from collapsing, but that it also includes the Soviet Union in the scope of European economic cooperation, thereby diluting the emotions of the people of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, this plan has very important significance from a long-term perspective. As Republican presidential candidate Stettinius said: "Whether world war and economic panic can be avoided in the future depends on the world economic policy adopted by the United States."</p>
<p>Suspicion between countries is of course caused by many factors; the elimination of suspicion also depends on the joint efforts of many parties. Although the current U.S. diplomatic authorities have the intention of improving U.S.-Soviet relations, whether this good plan can be effective depends on whether the other party can accept it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already flown to Paris yesterday to discuss the European economic cooperation plan with the French authorities. At the same time, there are also rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit France. However, the hope that the Soviet Union can also agree to the U.S. plan is very slim, because in the past few days, Moscow Radio has either criticized Secretary of State Marshall for promoting the Truman Doctrine or refuted the U.S. plan, attempting to use the dollar to oppress other countries. Therefore, at present, if Soviet politicians cannot reflect on themselves and thoroughly realize the situation, it seems impossible to turn hostility into peace between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Wallace's proposal, although it sounds very moving, is ultimately a beautiful fantasy that does not conform to reality!</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Paris, Holds Preliminary Consultations with French Foreign Minister, U.S. Aid to Europe Plan is the Focus of Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault held "exploratory" talks today to respond to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European economic recovery. At the same time, France urged European countries to participate in a specialized international committee to cooperate with the U.S. in drafting a unified aid procedure. However, France rejected the method of convening a European economic conference, believing that this move was too complicated and time-consuming.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and thirteen economic experts, including Earl, Stevens, and Waley, flew to Paris this afternoon to discuss concrete steps to implement the Marshall Plan for European recovery with the French authorities. Before Bevin boarded the plane, reporters asked whether he was optimistic about the outcome of the negotiations, given that the Soviet Union had already expressed its non-participation in the plan. Bevin replied: "I have never been so optimistic in my life. I will proceed calmly, and the result is difficult to predict." He then turned to the photographers and smiled, saying: "Don't waste too much film." The Foreign Office also issued a warning, saying that the Anglo-French negotiations were "exploratory" in nature and should not be expected to reach a rapid agreement. However, London believed that a joint communiqué on the outcome of the negotiations could be expected to be issued on the evening of the 18th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to host a banquet at the British Embassy tonight for French Prime Minister Ramadier, Foreign Minister Bidault, and economic experts from both countries. Discussions on the Marshall Plan will begin during the banquet. Bevin will return to London on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning to participate in Thursday's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, at which time he may report on the progress of the Paris talks. The method of exchanging views between British and French experts will be decided by Ramadier, Bidault, and Bevin tomorrow evening. Technical discussions can begin on Wednesday within the scope determined by the two foreign ministers. According to a dispatch from Geneva from this agency, personnel from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe hope that the commission will be able to assist in the implementation of Marshall's aid plan for Europe, but the scope of its assistance still depends on the attitude of Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] Alfin, the French representative to the United Nations Conference, told the press that France had proposed to the United States the establishment of various economic committees in Europe to determine the economic needs of Europe and the materials that the United States will supply. Regarding France's proposal on implementing the Marshall Plan for European economic aid, the U.S. Ambassador Factory Lai has also been instructed to submit it to the U.S. State Department last Saturday. Arshi said: If countries do not work hard themselves, Europe cannot recover. This effort cannot be replaced by external aid. The European economic committees proposed by France today should be composed of (1) representatives of European production countries and (2) representatives of the United States of the "United States." Their tasks are two: (1) In order to restore Europe's productivity, we must first adjust the equipment that Europe urgently needs, study the strength of mutual supply among European countries, and then determine the amount of assistance required from the United States; (2) In the "recuperation period" before Europe's production is restored, we should also determine the amount of consumer goods that Europe can produce. If the amount is insufficient, we should seek it from the United States.</p>
<h3>France Asks Molotov to Come to Paris, Soviet Government Has Not Yet Replied</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Although Moscow's "Pravda" today criticized Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe as "political pressure under the assistance of the dollar," French people are optimistic about the talks that the foreign ministers of Britain and France will begin in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the implementation of the Marshall Plan. According to the French Foreign Ministry today, the French government received a suggestion from Foreign Secretary Bevin to come to Paris and immediately sent a letter to Moscow to inquire whether the Soviet government is willing to exchange views with the foreign ministers of Britain and France on the Marshall Plan. If they agree, they will ask Molotov to come to Paris to participate in the meeting, but the Soviet government has not yet replied. The British government also sought the Soviet government's opinion on responding to the Marshall Plan before, but judging from the remarks of "Pravda" today, the British government's attempt will undoubtedly fail. The Soviet Union's reaction to the Marshall Plan is very important. If the Soviet Union is prepared to participate, the appearance of European economic cooperation is often the brightest since the end of the war. If the Soviet Union refuses, the division between East and West will inevitably become more apparent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 16th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the Foreign Ministry had not heard of the rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Moyutov would come to Paris.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Policy is the Decisive Factor for World Security, Stettinius Agrees with Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Snow Sermount, Pennsylvania, 16th] U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stettinius made a speech to students at Swarthmore University today, saying that the opportunity to avoid world war and economic panic depends on the United States' world economic policy. I fully agree with the opinions recently expressed by Secretary of State Marshal Marshal at Harvard University, advocating that European countries implement economic cooperation with the help of the United States. The United States should provide a large amount of assistance to European war-torn countries in the next ten years or longer to ensure peace. The United States can take immediate action in some areas without waiting for economic negotiations between European countries. European countries urgently need the coal mines in the Ruhr area. This problem can be solved only if Britain and the United States reach an agreement. The United States should also pay immediate attention to Britain's lack of dollar problems.</p>
<h3>World Bank Agrees with European Plan</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Quebec, 16th] International Development Bank Chairman McCloeh said this evening that the bank "is not only prepared but also eager to cooperate fully with any positive overall economic plan to develop Europe within its powers." According to Mai, he made a speech at this year's annual meeting of the New York State Bankers Association here. Qu Zhichen pointed out that the World Bank's responsibility is to create and develop the means of production of member countries, focusing on whether the loan is sound and reasonable, and what the nature of its production is.</p>
<h3>Churchill Leaves Hospital</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] Churchill recently had surgery in the hospital for a hernia and has recovered and left the hospital today and returned to his private residence in Hyde Park.</p>
<h3>Ramadier Receives U.S. Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>Discuss Marshall Aid to Europe Plan</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] It has been learned from reliable sources; Prime Minister Ramadier met with U.S. Ambassador Caffery this morning and discussed the Marshall Economic Aid Team Asia Plan, especially the economic needs of France. In addition, the visit of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to Paris to hold talks with French Foreign Minister Bidault was also discussed.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Asks France to Officially Recognize Independence</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 17th] The Kwaimeng Radio today broadcast a statement by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, stating that under certain conditions, it can cooperate with France within the French Federation of the West, the conditions being: (1) Officially recognizing the independence of Chunan; (2) The unification of the North Central Region and the South Region; (3) Vietnam has the right to be treated as a member of the French Federation.</p>
<h3>President Truman Vetoes Income Tax Reduction Bill, The Bill Will Be Reviewed by the Senate and House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman vetoed the Republican-proposed $4 billion income tax cut bill today, arguing that this would increase inflationary pressure. Unexpectedly, the House of Representatives will almost abolish its veto, but the Senate will support it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The tax bill, which has been passed by Congress to reduce domestic taxes by about $400 million annually, was vetoed by President Truman today. Since the Republican Party controlled Congress, it was the first time that the President had vetoed a bill passed by Congress. The President pointed out that the case sacrificed the ultimate good tax policy and offered risky and unstable benefits. From the government's financial point of view, it is quite insecure. This is the first major conflict between the President and Congress. Congress should review the case tomorrow. According to the Constitution, a case vetoed by the President must be maintained by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses. It is still difficult to determine whether the Republican Party can obtain the support of a two-thirds majority in both houses during the review to maintain the original case.</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Passes Wool Import Tax Increase Bill</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The wool bill, together with the increase in wool import tax, has been passed by the House of Representatives today. Government leaders had previously warned that approving the increase in wool import tax or restricting the quantity of foreign wool imports would hinder the success of the Geneva Trade Conference and hinder the smooth implementation of U.S. diplomatic and economic policies. The case may be submitted to the President this afternoon for signature or veto.</p>
<h3>U.S. Vows to Help Free Countries Resist Aggression by Totalitarian Countries</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco 17th broadcast: President Truman delivered a speech at Princeton University today, saying: "The United States will definitely help free countries resist aggression by totalitarian countries and will implement universal military training. It has been a full month since the end of this great war and is in urgent need of recovery and reconstruction. Our current task is to establish an orderly world in the midst of chaos. This task is arduous and cannot be accomplished by the United States or any one country alone. Peace-loving countries must work together to achieve success. But unless there is strength as a backing, a stable world cannot be realized, and the people of all countries will not be able to decide their own destiny according to their free will. The United States' spiritual leadership must have strength as its backing. If the United States shows weakness, small countries will think that we have given up our responsibility to lead the world, and they will mistakenly believe that we have no intention of fulfilling our promises to help free and independent countries maintain their freedom. Under this unstable situation, these small countries will inevitably be unable to resist the intrusion of totalitarian pressure, and we must not disappoint friendly countries." Regarding the implementation of universal military training, the U.S. President said: "Our purpose in training young people is not to win the next war, but to avoid war."</p>
<h3>Wallace Advocates Convening a Meeting of Two Giants, Du and Shi, The Movement to Form a New Party is in the Brewing</h3>
<p>[Slightly Leaking News Agency, Washington, 16th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace gave his most surprising speech here at the "Watergate" Grand Theater today after his European tour, asking President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to invite Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov to a meeting in Berlin to solve the German and Austrian problems. Wallace also urged the United States to propose to the United Nations an international arms control program to break the deadlock in atomic energy control negotiations. He also advocated that the Democratic Party lead the movement to nationalize the U.S. arms industry so that no one can profit from it when fulfilling the patriotic responsibility of defending the country.</p>
<p>Wallace also threatened to form a third party in the 1948 presidential election, declaring that "if the two major parties continue to pursue suicidal policies towards war and collapse, a third party will be formed, regardless of whether this third party has hope of success in the 1948 presidential election." Hua said: "If the United States wants to avoid economic depression, it really needs a socialist Europe and the Soviet Union market. If Truman and Marshall can frankly discuss each other's economic needs with Stalin and Molotov, an agreement can be reached. If we can remember that socialism has no criminal component, we can trade with a socialist Europe in peace."</p>
<h3>Wallace is Preparing to Participate in the Next Presidential Election</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace advocated that the two giants, Truman and Stalin, meet in Berlin to resolve U.S.-Soviet disputes and is now waiting for an official response, while the movement to elect Wallace as president has gradually taken shape today. This movement was initiated in California, and Hua said that he knew nothing about it. According to former California Attorney General Kenny in Los Angeles, the movement to elect Wallace will be held at a meeting in Falaise, California, on July 19. Hua will not attend, but will send a telegram to the meeting.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Other Countries Should Be Within Its Means</h3>
<p>Ex-U.S. President Herbert Hoover's Opinion</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 16th] Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover recently wrote to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, stating that the U.S. should continue to aid the people of other countries, but at the same time, it must take steps to avoid its own economy from rapidly disintegrating due to the heavy burden of aiding other countries. Hoover also said that the U.S. should "strongly urge" some countries to jointly find ways to alleviate this burden.</p>
<h3>U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Shows Expanding Trend</h3>
<p>Railway Freight Transportation Also at Risk of Stoppage</p>
<p>[New York, United Press, 16th] The strike of seamen on U.S. foreign ships has today affected all seaports nationwide, and railway freight transportation is also at risk of stoppage within 48 hours. There seems to be no hope of resolving the strike. A union spokesman said that the strike would halt 2,000 ships, and if negotiations completely fail, oil tankers will also be drawn into the vortex. Undersecretary of Labor Gibson has been ordered to arrive here to mediate with shipowners.</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 16th] The Department of Labor has sent a special representative, Mr. Schanrenbach, to San Francisco to participate in the West Coast shipping mediation talks.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Liberal Party Rally Disrupted by Communists, Conflict Erupts, Five Liberal Party Members Injured with Clubs and Forks as Weapons</h3>
<p>[Szeged, Hungary, United Press, 10th] Approximately 150 communists, armed with hard objects stuffed into rubber hoses as clubs, steel rings on their fingers, or axe-shaped Hungarian tools, disrupted a Liberal Party rally here today. The purpose of the rally was to prove whether Hungary still has freedom of speech and assembly. Approximately 700 Hungarian men and women participated, resisting the communists with their bare hands. A bloody battle ensued, and one communist was pushed out of a third-story window. The number of injured is unknown. According to official reports, five Liberal Party members suffered severe head injuries from being stabbed with large forks and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The organizer of the rally, Liberal Party leader Mr. Suriok, originally announced as the main speaker, did not attend at the last minute. The Liberal Party rally was held on the third floor of a dance hall here. Thirty police officers were present to monitor the event. After the meeting, several full-scale conflicts occurred. The police used gun butts to strike the faces of those involved in the conflicts. A large number of police arrived and dispersed a crowd of approximately 1,000 people in the square outside the dance hall. Earlier, the communists pushed aside the gatekeepers and stormed into the meeting hall. Several British and American reporters were present. The first conflict occurred when the chairman introduced Member of Parliament Mr. Vencinaghi, who is unrelated to former Prime Minister Nagy but is just as vehemently anti-communist as Mr. Suriok. Nagy was interrupted by communists cheering and shouting "Long live Stalin." The Liberal Party countered by cheering "Long live Suriok." They then noticed the American reporters in the guest seating and cheered "Long live America."</p>

<p>[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 17th] Plum Yoong-Tjo, the Chinese judge of the International Military Tribunal, was late to the war crimes trial this morning by about an hour because his driver was detained by military police. Mr. Plum intended to sit in the car designated for his use as usual this morning, but later learned that his driver had been "detained." Mr. Plum managed to find transportation within an hour, but was still an hour late. Mr. Plum immediately informed Chief Justice Weber of the reason for his lateness. Mr. Weber was very angry and ordered the trial to proceed, declaring that the matter was almost contempt of court and did not consider the delay of almost an hour for Judge Plum to be accidental. The military police did not announce the reason for the detention of Mr. Plum's driver this morning.</p>

Mr. Martel stated when submitting the report that international cooperation is needed in the following areas: (1) restoring and developing the electricity industry to modernize European industry; (2) promoting the production of raw materials needed for restoration; (3) effectively allocating the supply of daily necessities; (4) exchanging raw materials and production tools.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Situation Gradually Becomes Clear, Sjahrir Goes to Batavia</h3>
<p>Rumored to Meet with British Authorities</p>
<p>[Batavia, United Press, 17th] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir will travel from Linggajati to Batavia tomorrow at the invitation of a certain foreign country. He has been staying there ever since the Indonesian cabinet meeting concluded and drafted the May 27 memorandum in response to the Netherlands. It is widely believed that Britain is the country inviting him here. It is expected that Sjahrir will meet with British authorities in Batavia, and Britain may ask Sjahrir to cooperate in order to change the attitude of the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 16th] A Foreign Office spokesman said: British Consul-General to Batavia, Mr. Mitcheson, recently traveled to Yogyakarta in central Java, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, to obtain information on the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. After completing his mission, he has returned to Batavia and submitted a report to the British government. Mr. Mitcheson may have contacted Sjahrir, but reports that Mr. Mitcheson suggested British mediation have been denied by authorities in London.</p>
<h3>France Proposes Definite Number to Participate in International Police Force</h3>
<p>[Lake Success, United Press, 17th] France has notified the United Nations organization that it can only provide one infantry division to participate in the international police force at present. Among the five major powers, France is the first to propose a specific number for the international police force. The Soviet Union insists that all countries should provide equal manpower, aircraft, and warships to maintain a smaller international police force. China, Britain, and the United States agree that the international police force should be organized according to their respective strengths, with the British and American navies and air forces and the Soviet army making more contributions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper's Sinister Motives, Advocates Recalling Ryukyu Islands, Rumors that MacArthur Indeed Intends to "Adjust" the Status of Ryukyu</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, Agence France-Presse, 17th] Today's Asahi Shimbun correspondence column published a letter from a resident of Okinawa Island, supporting Foreign Minister Ashida's proposal on the 5th of this month to determine the status of the Ryukyu Islands, especially Okinawa Island. The letter strongly argues that Japan needs to express goodwill to the residents of Okinawa Island, especially to the Okinawans currently residing in Japan. The letter points out that 80% of the Japanese repatriated from various parts of the South Pacific are from Okinawa Prefecture. If the Japanese authorities want to acquire the islands, why not help the suffering people of Okinawa, assist in the island's reconstruction, and aid the millions of impoverished people? Observers attach importance to this letter. Well-informed sources agree with Ashida's view but consider it untimely and likely to hinder MacArthur's plan. MacArthur intends to adjust the status of the Ryukyu Islands after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, at which time a referendum will likely be held.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Severely Criticizes Ashida's Shamelessness</h3>
<p>[Moscow, Agence France-Presse, 16th] Regarding Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida's denial that he recently demanded that part of the Kuril Islands be returned to Japan, Soviet commentator Leontiev published an article in today's Pravda, calling it a shameless roar. The article stated: Ashida clearly made this request in a speech on the 5th of this month, and now he pretends that Japan did not participate in the Yalta Conference, causing Japan to feel uneasy about the final decision on the fate of the Kuril Islands. It must be known that the Yalta Agreement was signed by the Allied countries that defeated Japan and imposed unconditional surrender on that country. There is absolutely no room for Japan to participate. However, it is futile to explain such basic things to Ashida. It would be more helpful to find out who allowed Ashida to forget the fact that Japan surrendered unconditionally.</p>
<h3>Burmese Constituent Assembly Passes Resolution on Political System</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, Broadcast on the 17th: The Burmese Constituent Assembly passed a resolution today declaring that the future political system of Burma will be an independent democratic republic, called the "Union of Burma." The resolution was proposed by the Vice-Chairman of the Governor's Executive Council, who said that Burma would gain independence within a year and hoped that Britain would transfer power to the Burmese people in an amicable atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Execution of Wolves and Tigers Causes Citywide Stir, Tens of Thousands Line Streets to See Two Demons, Each Leaves a Last Testament to Console Mother and Instruct Children, Shimoda's Attitude Haughty, Yonekura's Words Cunning, Even in Death They Still Extol "Sino-Japanese Friendship"</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yonekura Kiki, the "Wolf of Party Heat," and Shimoda Jiro, the "Tiger of Jiangyin," two Japanese war criminals who committed heinous crimes, were executed by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense at the Jiangwan execution ground at 5:05 p.m. yesterday. The two criminals remained unchanged in appearance and calm in attitude until their deaths. Before the execution, they were paraded through the city in prisoner vehicles. Along the way, tens of thousands of people lined the streets to watch, and traffic was interrupted. The citizens saw these two murderous evils walking the path to blood debt, and all clapped and cheered. The public sentiment is recorded below: At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, Military Tribunal Prosecutor Fu Shude, Prosecutor Kuang Jun, Translator Luo Jie, Chief Clerk Li Yechu, Clerk Yuan, Clerk Wang Shushen, and others were ready and departed for the Shanghai Prison with military police. When the vehicles arrived at the gate of the prison, the crowd of tens of thousands stirred, and the walls and utility poles were full of people. When they saw the military vehicles arrive, shouts erupted. The prosecutors entered the prison and set up a temporary court in the patio at the entrance of the women's prison, ordering that Shimoda and Yonekura be brought in. After hearing the news in their cells, the two criminals requested to bathe, shave, and straighten their military uniforms, which took more than an hour. At 2:00 p.m., Shimoda Jiro was brought in first. Shimoda's attitude was haughty, but there was a slight look of sorrow.</p>
<h3>Nodding and Smiling Bitterly, Sitting Upright to Write Last Testament</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Fu informed him that he would be executed today. The criminal nodded. He was then asked if he had any last words. Shimoda immediately asked for a pen and paper. He sat upright at the prepared desk and chairs and began to write directly. The pen was a fountain pen belonging to Translator Luo Jie, and the paper was the official paper of the Military Tribunal. When Shimoda wrote to the second sheet, the ink ran out, so he asked for another pen to continue writing. It took him twenty-five minutes to finish writing two letters, one to Lieutenant General Jukawa, commander of the Japanese military police, and one to his mother (details below). The prosecutor asked again if he had anything else to say. Shimoda said: "This case really has nothing to do with me. It will be clear in the future." When asked if he wanted to take a numbing injection, Shimoda arrogantly said, "No need." He was immediately bound. At that time, the criminal's body trembled slightly, as if he wanted to cry, but he forced a bitter smile and said: "Please tell the military police not to tie me too tightly. I won't run away." At 2:35 p.m., Shimoda was first escorted onto the prisoner vehicle. Yonekura Kiki was brought in next. Yonekura entered with a bitter smile and nodded to both sides. Prosecutor Fu also informed him that he would be executed today and asked if he had any last words. Yonekura also asked for paper and a pen to write. When he wrote to the second page, he stopped writing in the middle and asked for another piece of paper to rewrite. It took him thirty minutes to finish writing three letters, one to Lieutenant General Jukawa, one to his son, and one to An Weinan, the former county magistrate of Changshu who is now a speaker (details below).</p>
<p>Shimoda Jiro (right) and Yonekura Kiki (left) were paraded through the streets and escorted to the Jiangwan execution ground.</p>

<h3>A Few Questions and Answers, Escorted onto the Prisoner Vehicle</h3>
<p>After writing, the prosecutor asked again if he had anything else to say. Yonekura said: "The residents of Changshu and Taicang hope to take me to Changshu for execution. It is not good to execute me in Shanghai today." After thinking for a moment, he said: "I really have nothing to do with this case. A detailed investigation will reveal the truth." Yonekura also refused to take a numbing injection. Before being bound, he said: "If there are any family members of the Chinese who died tragically here today, please say hello for me." Prosecutor Fu finally asked if he knew where the remains of many of the victims were, since they were unknown. Yonekura said: "It is best to investigate this in Japan. I don't know." He was immediately escorted onto the prisoner vehicle.</p>
<h3>Crowds Surge at Execution Ground</h3>
<p>At 3:15, the prisoner vehicles, led by motorcycle police vehicles and guarded by machine gun vehicles and military police vehicles at the rear, drove out of the prison. The crowd outside the gate roared like thunder, and the shouts shook the sky. The procession passed Dongdaming Road, crossed Baidu Bridge, passed East Zhongshan Road, East Nanjing Road, West Nanjing Road, and turned into North Zhongzheng First Road, Central Linsen Road, South Xizang Road, and the Great World, then turned into East Zhongzheng Road, Central Sichuan Road, North Sichuan Road, and went straight to the Jiangwan execution ground. The road was packed with people who wanted to see the real faces of this tiger and wolf. The crowds surrounding the execution ground surged even more.</p>
<h3>Death with One Shot Each</h3>
<p>Arriving at the execution ground at 4:45, the military police did their best to maintain order and cordon off an open space. At 5:00 p.m., the two criminals were escorted off the prisoner vehicles and walked to the open space. Yonekura initially refused to kneel, but was forcibly pushed down. At this time, the signal sounded, and two shots were heard. The wooden-barreled guns of the execution military police Liao Jiaqing and Jiang Wujun had pierced the heads of the two criminals. Fresh blood spurted out, and the tiger and the wolf died together. Applause erupted from all around, and the people were very happy. The two prosecutors immediately stepped forward to examine the bodies. Shimoda's bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the left side of the head. Yonekura's bullet entered from the back right of the head and exited from the lower jaw on the left. The two corpses were then covered with white cloth, waiting to be claimed by the local Japanese residents.</p>
<h3>Last Testaments:</h3>
<p>Shimoda</p>
<p>Last Testament, one addressed to Lieutenant General Jukawa and others, the general meaning in Japanese is: "I have been thinking day and night about someone saving me, but now that I have reached this point, I am not afraid at all. I die for the country, but I am infinitely moved when I think of my old mother. This is also fate. Please convey my regards to those I have troubled before. When I was in office, I did not involve myself in love, fame, glory, money, which I feel quite comforted by. Today the country has failed, and the innocent are also being executed, but this is the cornerstone of the country's revival. 橘 poem says: For the sake of 毕上, we sacrifice, forward, straight forward! I did not obtain my military status in various environments. Finally, I thank the Holy Spirit." Another letter to his mother said: "When you hear the news of my execution, you must be shocked and saddened, but as the mother of a soldier, please don't be sad. I also planned to write a few words to my older brother and other family members, but due to various things in prison, I was unable to write them. However, the name of my Jiro will forever be the pillar of the Shimoda family, and it will never open up, and it will surely make the family prosper. Please greet the gentlemen of Kugumiyaoka and Ishihara and other relatives. This letter was written one quarter of an hour before going to the execution ground. Please forgive me for not being able to be filial to my old mother. Please don't forget the vow at the Itsukushima Shrine."</p>
<p>Yonekura</p>
<p>One of the last testaments says: "To Lieutenant General Jukawa, Lieutenant General Ban, Major General Shihou, and everyone in Jiangwan: The scheduled execution date has arrived. I am deeply grateful for all the kindness you have shown me during my life. This result is whether my subordinates (Yonekura calls himself) are loyal enough. Here, I wish you a long life. If I have not been loyal, please take care of me when you have the opportunity. Today, my death can maintain my loyalty. Please forgive me for not doing my best." The second letter to his son, Yonekura Katsusuke, says: "The time to say goodbye to you forever has come. My life will be clear to others. Don't be sad. Everyone has unfortunate encounters. You must overcome them to succeed. I am dying now. I believe that you, your mother, and your children will be able to follow what I often say. Loyalty and filial piety are the duties of subjects. You should never forget them in your dreams. There are many noble people among the Chinese. I got along well with these people in my life. There should be no prejudice between ethnic groups. This incident can create the opening of East Asian nations in the future. Say hello to Ishikawa Yoshiaki and other former team members."</p>
<h3>Unwelcome Kindness</h3>
<p>The third last testament addressed to the current Changshu Magistrate An Weinan said: "I am convinced that your family's sense of justice is the foundation for future Sino-Japanese friendship. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Changshu is my second hometown. After I die, my soul will surely come to Changshu to protect the people of Changshu. Please convey my regards to the fathers and representatives of the entire county," and so on. His unchanging foolish loyalty and filial piety overflowed between the lines. Citizens watching at the scene said: "Considering the countless compatriots of mine who were brutally killed by this criminal's hands during the Lunar New Year, it is too cheap for the two criminals to die with one shot today."</p>
<h3>Gunshots in the New China Dance Hall, Self-Inflicted Wound Due to Drunkenness</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At about 10:30 last night, in the New China Dance Hall on Central Zhongzheng Road, Li Liang (24 years old), a voluntary inspector of the Fourth Inspection Brigade of the Nanshi Police, accidentally touched the trigger while holding a gun in his hand due to drunkenness, causing the gun to go off suddenly.

<h3>Female Painter Suspected of Being a Traitor, Li Qingping Declared Not Guilty, Still Detained on the Same Day Awaiting Release After Confirmation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Hankou City Police Bureau believed that female painter Li Qingping had colluded with the enemy's naval reporting minister Matsuo and Shioda during the enemy puppet period, providing important information. It sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Li at the New Life Club's exhibition last October and transferred her to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. She was prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. After eight months, the High Court finally concluded the case. The case was pronounced in the High Court yesterday morning. After Chief Judge Xiao, Associate Judge Qiu Ding, and Prosecutor Ye Yushao took their seats, they asked the court supervisor to bring Li to the court. Chief Judge Xiao stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Li Qingping is not guilty." The court informed her that she would still be detained today. If the prosecutor did not apply for a retrial, she would be released immediately after confirmation. Li only said yes. Li was wearing a light green women's western suit, jade silk stockings, and cream-colored leather shoes. She had two short braids and looked better than at the previous trial. When she was taken back into custody, she frequently covered her mouth with a handkerchief, seemingly unable to hide the joy in her heart.</p>
<h3>Four Pilot Post Offices, Beautiful Style, Regular Service</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In view of the large population and vast area of this city, the General Post Office believes that the existing branches cannot meet the needs of citizens, but it is difficult to realize the addition of branches due to difficulties in funding and housing. In order to divert the congestion of branches, facilitate citizens, and expand business, it has been decided to set up 15 post offices in the city. After consulting the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and soliciting opinions, four locations have been temporarily designated for pilot implementation: (1) Bund of Nanjing Road; (2) New World of Racecourse; (3) In front of the Huangjin Grand Theater in Eight Immortals Bridge; (4) In front of the Zhaofeng Public Country Gate. The post office is still a novelty in this city. According to its design, the top of the post office has a streamlined shape, 7 feet 6 inches high and 5 feet 4 inches deep, and is square, accommodating two postal workers. The whole body is dyed white and inlaid with light line stripes, which is very beautiful. The whole is made of wood and is equipped with sun protection equipment. If there are no unexpected obstacles, the four post offices are scheduled to start operating on the 25th of this month. Except for remittances and parcels, other businesses in this post office are the same as in the post office branches.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Tragedy of the Fu Po Battleship: Witness Testimony, Details of the Accident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The trial of the Fu Po battleship tragedy continued in the local court yesterday morning. More than forty family members of the officers and soldiers who died in the disaster sat in the public gallery of the Second Criminal Court early in the morning, waiting for the court to open. The order was quite good. After Judge Zhong Xianda took the bench, he summoned five passengers from the Hai Min transport ship to testify. However, only Li Xiuming appeared in court yesterday. According to Li's testimony: a Guangdong native residing at No. 1, Lane 61, Xudu South Road, engaged in import and export business. On March 19th, he took the Hai Min transport from Shantou to Shanghai. At around 12:10 a.m., he felt the ship shake violently. He went to the upper deck to observe and could no longer see the Fu Po battleship at this time. However, in the darkness, he heard a chaotic clamor on the sea, with cries of "Help!" The Hai Min ship continued to sail forward. Later, passengers questioned Captain Dai, asking why he didn't help, so he turned back to the original location to salvage. However, from the collision to the rescue, about four and a half hours had passed, so only Jiao Dexiao was rescued. After the witness finished his testimony, the defendant's lawyer requested the court to summon Senator Ye Daoyuan as a witness. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and said that the debate trial will be opened next month to conclude the case.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents, Dragon Boat Festival Gift Money, Municipal Government Also Holds Reception, Inviting Dependents to Dine and Watch a Play</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government has decided to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on active duty by issuing preferential grain once during the Dragon Boat Festival. The methods are as follows: (1) The preferential grain is based on the standard of two shi of yellow grain per year for each impoverished military dependent and each self-sufficient military dependent household, as stipulated. It is proposed to issue an average of one shi per person, and an average of three people per household, and instead issue cash, calculated at half the current limited price of rice, 168,000 yuan per shi, for a total of 252,000 yuan for three shi. (2) Those who receive the cash for preferential grain must hold a preferential certificate from the Municipal Government, and are limited to the spouse and direct relatives and minor siblings of the soldier on active duty. The order of priority for receiving the cash for preferential grain is: spouse if there is a spouse, children if there is no spouse, parents if there are no children, grandparents if there are no parents, and minor siblings if there are no grandparents. (3) The issuance of preferential grain will be carried out by the Municipal Government printing two copies of a receipt, which will first be handed over to the district office for distribution to the families of soldiers on active duty to sign and seal, and the district Baojia chief will affix his seal as proof. It must be brought along with the preferential certificate when claiming the grain during the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government will also hold a reception at 9:00 a.m. on the Dragon Boat Festival, inviting all military dependents, having a luncheon at noon, and issuing preferential grain cash at the same time. In the afternoon, movie theater tickets will be issued to invite them to watch a play.</p>
<h3>Public Training Students Prepare Gift Money, Present to the Families of Martyred National Heroes</h3>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Municipal Public Training Alumni Association, recently, as the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, the executive director of the association, Wang Boyuan, mindful of the difficult lives of the families of martyrs, personally donated legal tender 100,000 yuan to the alumni association to be distributed to each family of martyrs as Dragon Boat Festival consolation money.</p>
<h3>Bodies from the Da Feng Ship Disaster, Continued Handling of Funeral Arrangements, One Body of a Jiaotong University Student Retrieved by Family for Burial, Body of Unknown Major Adjutant Awaits Claim</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the bodies of the Da Feng ship disaster passengers were successively discovered in the river waters of Baoshan and Taicang counties, the Da Feng Shipping Bureau immediately notified the families of the deceased to come and identify them, while Pushan Villa handled the collection, encoffining, and burial matters. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Pushan Villa continued to dispatch three cars, carrying coffins, workers, and the families of the deceased, to Taicang and Binshan counties to continue identifying, collecting, and burying the bodies together with the Da Feng Shipping Bureau.</p>
<p>Identification Difficult Due to Prolonged Decomposition</p>
<p>One car heading to Baoshan returned to Shanghai at around 4:00 p.m., bringing back five bodies. Among them, the name of one of the deceased was Ju Yinsheng, and he has been identified and claimed by his family. The remaining four are of unknown names. However, one of them was a soldier, identified by his shoulder insignia as a major adjutant. These four are temporarily housed in the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau. There are still twelve bodies on the beach of Shizi Ridge in Wusongkou Taiwan. More than thirty others were salvaged by local villagers and buried shallowly on the spot. Guanshan Villa is scheduled to send workers again today to exhume these bodies for family members to identify. However, the bodies have been floating in the water for many days, and most of them have already decomposed, making identification particularly difficult. One of them, before burial, had already been identified as Sun Qi, a 20-year-old Jiaotong University student. His family then personally encoffined him.</p>
<p>On-site Burial in Taicang</p>
<p>On the Taicang side, the bodies were discovered in the fields of Yanglinkou and Qiyakou. The nearby villagers salvaged more than forty bodies. Because the bodies were rotten and smelly, more than half had already been buried by the local Bao chiefs and others. The Taicang County Local Court has also sent prosecutors to inspect. Yesterday, only four bodies were recorded. Because the riverside areas such as Yemaoyan are far from Taicang City, the car burial team of Pushan Villa still stayed there, waiting for the families to finish identifying the bodies. The remaining unclaimed bodies will be buried on the spot and will no longer be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Decision in Fu Po Case Imminent, China Merchants Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Attend</h3>

According to relevant sources yesterday, the decision is imminent. The China Merchants Bureau has dispatched Fan Lun, the chief of the maritime affairs section of the shipping department, Captain Chen Tianjun, together with Chief Mate Wu Nianzu, Second Mate Wu Kan, and helmsmen, carrying the case files.

Huang Muzong, the director of the local Navigation Administration Bureau, was also invited to attend and traveled to Beijing in the same car with Fan Lun and others yesterday. It is heard that the date of the decision may be implemented within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Index Dispute, Will Be Transferred to the Assessment Committee for Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The silk weaving industry index dispute in the 1234 districts has been repeatedly convened for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, but the opinions of both parties have ultimately failed to converge. The Social Affairs Bureau now intends to transfer the case to the Labor-Management Assessment Committee for handling.</p>
<p>Workers in the Western-style women's clothing industry submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, pointing out that 180 workers in the industry association have gone on strike, and requesting that it be stopped.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is also appealing to workers in the sofa industry and the handkerchief group in the dyeing and weaving industry in the third district, who claim that the employers are not paying wages according to the index.</p>
<h3>Lead Printing Industry Association Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Lead Printing Industry Association held an emergency temporary members' meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, chaired by Zhu Wenxian. Resolutions: (1) Cancel the 13.5 yuan living allowance for workers' families. The reason is that the cost of living index has been unfrozen, the current environment has changed, and only a few colleagues actually implement this allowance. Some issue 8 yuan or 5 yuan, so it should be uniformly canceled to show fairness. (2) Continue to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to designate one union for the industry's occupational and industrial unions to avoid ambiguity. (3) Demand the restoration of the end-of-year salary for 1936. (4) Wages should be issued according to the index of the previous month. The meeting also discussed the occurrence of strikes among various members. It was unanimously resolved that each member who has gone on strike should report to the meeting for handling. Workers on strike will not be provided with meals or wages, which was unanimously passed.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Industry Labor-Management Dispute, Temporarily Concluded After Mediation</h3>
<p>The labor and management of the North-South goods industry, for the May cost of living index, yesterday underwent two mediations by the Labor Union Federation of the Statistics Council. The following methods were initially formulated: (1) Both labor and management will petition the Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration on the May cost of living index. (2) Before the labor and management have resolved the issue, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided that the May salary and allowance will be calculated based on the index of 16400 times from now on, and three-quarters of the salary and allowance will be issued first. (3) Labor and management will organize a price assessment council to adjust and unify commodity prices, to be established on July 1st. In the above situation, the employers have agreed to notify all member stores to implement it first, and during this dispute period, workers must not be dismissed to avoid further disputes.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Personnel from Our Resident Delegation to Japan Will Depart from Shanghai for Japan This Afternoon on the Hai Qian Transport</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Qian transport ship was dispatched to Japan to bring back overseas Chinese.

<h3>Bao Dayong Accused Case, Councilor Xie Qingbai Testifies That Forced Bribery Did Not Happen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Bao Dayong, the district chief of the eighth district of Xujiahui, was accused by Cheng Xiaoshi, a resident of the district, of forcing bribery. The case was interrogated by Prosecutor Fang Zheng at the local procuratorate yesterday. Senator Xie Qingbai, a related person, was summoned for questioning. According to Xie, "Zhou Yinchun, the husband of Cheng Xiaoshi, had a dispute with District Chief Bao over the construction of a house. Senator Zhou Chengxiang and I were both entrusted to mediate. It was entirely out of a desire to resolve the problem. It is true that we invited District Chief Bao to dinner, but the rumors of extorting 10 million yuan are definitely not true." The court hearing ended here, and the case was postponed for further investigation.</p>
<h3>National Diplomacy Association Cables Request for Strict Negotiations with the Soviet and Mongolian Governments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese National Diplomacy Association, regarding the Outer Mongolian incident, the Soviet and Mongolian governments have not yet responded to our protests. It has sent separate cables again urging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nanjing General Association to call for strict negotiations.</p>
<h3>Necessary Goods Factories Have Insufficient Working Capital, Social Affairs Bureau Willing to Assist in Contacting for Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A reporter interviewed Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. After the cost of living index was unfrozen, many factories were unable to bear it. The reporter asked whether the Social Affairs Bureau intends to petition the government for loans to provide relief. Director Wu replied: "Considering the many abuses of industrial loans in the past, we are unwilling to take this action again. However, if factories that produce essential goods have insufficient working capital or are truly unable to maintain operations, they can contact the Social Affairs Bureau, which is very willing to assist in contacting the Four Joint Offices to provide loans. The Social Affairs Bureau knows the internal operations and production status of various factories in detail, and it is also convenient to supervise the use of loans after they are issued." Many factories have already contacted about this matter. However, various factories also need to reform their personnel system and management in many ways. Otherwise, it will be like a bottomless pit, and loans will be futile and still unable to save their crisis.</p>
<h3>Federation of Labor Unions Sends Representatives to Meet with Director Wu, Opposing the Restoration of the End-of-Year Salary for 1936</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the cost of living index was unfrozen and the May cost of living index for workers was released, the industry and commerce sectors in the city have felt unable to bear it. After several discussions, it was decided to request the government to restore wages to the end-of-1936 levels and other points, and Luo Qinghua was sent to Beijing to petition the relevant departments for remedies. The Municipal Federation of Labor Unions was shocked by the news and also intends to send representatives to Beijing to petition. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, five representatives, Shui Xiangyun, Liang Yongzhang, Ye Bang, Fang Rusheng, and Gui Fusheng, visited Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and expressed their opposition to the points raised by the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, demanding that the status quo be maintained. Director Wu received them and replied as follows: (1) Regarding the employers' request to restore the end-of-1936 salary, I have never agreed to it or promised to consider it. This is a contractual issue between labor and management, and the administrative authorities cannot interfere. If the employers want to abandon the self-made contract, they can file a lawsuit in court. If the employers say that they were coerced into signing the contract by the labor party, then since they did not declare it invalid afterward, the government considers it to be legal. (2) I am willing to consider the employers' request to issue the current month's wages according to the previous month's index separately. If they are losing money and cannot afford it, it can be considered, but this does not refer to one industry, but to each factory individually. There is another situation, such as orders for the machinery industry and the shipbuilding industry cannot be delivered immediately, and it is quite difficult to estimate the cost. It can also be considered, and the details will be discussed at the Labor-Management Evaluation Meeting on the 19th. (3) The employers' request to dismiss workers and issue wages in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law can be considered because there is a legal basis and they have the right to make this request. Director Wu also advised the Federation of Labor Unions not to go to Beijing to petition. If necessary, he will go to Beijing to ask the central government for instructions.</p>
<h3>New Measures Set for Encouraging Sales of U.S. Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>The Secretary in charge of the U.S. Dollar Bonds Sales Committee stated: To strengthen the fundraising efforts, the committee will launch two major fundraising campaigns in the city. First, a household-based fundraising campaign will be launched, with each household in non-poor areas subscribing to at least ten U.S. dollars in bonds, equivalent to 120,000 National Currency. Households that subscribe will be issued a Certificate of Reputation by the committee, which will be posted at the door. Second, a million-citizen campaign will be launched to subscribe to U.S. dollar bonds for the country. The fundraising method for this campaign will focus on people's organizations, and the committee will send U.S. dollar bond subscription vouchers to each organization, which will then subscribe on their own. The committee will then send personnel to collect the money.</p>
<h3>The Zhijiang Ship Sinking Case Will Continue Hearing on the 20th</h3>

<h3>Seaside Bathing Beach Not Yet Repaired, Strictly Forbidden to Go Swimming</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Gaoqiao seaside bathing beach was the only summer resort before the war. Now that the weather is getting warmer, there are rumors that the municipal authorities are planning to repair it. A responsible person from the Municipal Public Works Bureau denied this yesterday. According to him, the old site of the seaside bathing beach has been unmanaged during the war, resulting in its desolation to this day. It has been almost completely washed away by the tide. At present, a deep gully has formed between the inner beach and the outer beach at the new site. In June last year, seven people entered the sea for swimming, and five of them drowned. Currently, due to the city's financial difficulties and the considerable cost of repairs, the Public Works Bureau has not yet received orders for repairs. It is hoped that before the bathing beach is repaired, people will be strictly forbidden to go swimming to avoid danger.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) Dissolution of Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jianshan asks: I am 25 years old. Last autumn, my parents arranged an engagement with a Ms. Zhang. At that time, I did not give my consent. Now I know that the other party is poorly educated and has a bad temper. I intend to dissolve the marriage contract, but I am not familiar with the legal procedures. Please give detailed instructions.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves. Since this marriage contract was not entered into by yourself, it is invalid and you are not bound by it.</p>
<p>(2) Marriage Contract Dispute</p>
<p>Chen Zhengwu asks: My relative, A, is female. At the age of sixteen, her mother arranged for her to be betrothed to a man, B, through a matchmaker. At that time, A did not give her consent. Now A has another interest, C, and wants to dissolve the original marriage contract. Now there are several legal questions, please provide answers. (1) Was the marriage contract entered into by A's mother on her behalf when A was a minor valid? (2) Can A publish a statement in the newspaper denying the marriage contract as invalid because she is under the legal age? (3) How should we deal with B if he uses illegal coercion? (4) How should we deal with B if he does not agree to dissolve the contract? (5) Does the person who proposes to dissolve the contract have to compensate the other party for losses? (6) How should the bride price be returned? (7) If B finds out about the relationship between A and C, can he file a lawsuit? (8) Before A and B dissolve the marriage contract, can C enter into a marriage contract with A? (9) Before A and C enter into a marriage contract, can C assist in dissolving the contract?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] (1) According to the provisions of Article 972 of the Civil Code, this marriage contract is invalid. (2) This marriage contract is naturally invalid and there is no need to publish a statement in the newspaper. (3) Should be dealt with according to law. (4) Since it is invalid, B has no right to interfere. (5) Since the marriage contract is fundamentally invalid, there is no need to go through the dissolution procedure. (6) Return the original amount. (7) It is not illegal. (8) Since the marriage contract is invalid, it is the same as not being engaged. C can naturally enter into a marriage contract with A. (9) There is no need to assist in dissolving the contract.</p>

<h3>Difficulties with Tongji University's Resumption of Classes: Dean of Academic Affairs and Others Resign Jointly to Apologize to the School; President Dong Xifan Traveled to Beijing Last Night to Seek Instructions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] Since the outbreak of the student movement at Tongji University, most departments and faculties have gone on strike. President Dong Xifan, in order to prevent students from wasting their valuable time and studies, repeatedly urged them to resume classes, but to no avail. Dong himself felt ashamed and regretful for his ineffective supervision of education and misleading students, and also stated that his physical strength was insufficient to cope with the heavy workload. He submitted his resignation to the ministry three times in succession, but although the ministry earnestly tried to retain him, his determination to resign remained firm. The heads of various administrative departments of the school jointly submitted their resignations the day before yesterday due to the students' lack of sincerity in resuming classes. After Mr. Dong's attempts to retain them proved unsuccessful, he traveled to Beijing that night to seek instructions from the Ministry of Education. Currently, the school's administration is in a state of standstill. The following is an excerpt of the school's announcement and the resignation letters of the administrative heads:</p>
<p>Announcement</p>
<p>"Since this school has been affected by the student movement, only the Freshman Academy and the senior classes of various faculties, as well as the affiliated Senior Nursing School, the affiliated Vocational Department of Acoustics Inspection, and the affiliated Mechanical Engineering Specialization Course, have either continued classes without interruption or have already resumed classes out of concern for their studies. The other classes have been on strike for more than three weeks, arbitrarily sacrificing valuable time, which is extremely regrettable! This school cannot bear for the students' studies to suffer losses for so long, and in order to restore the school to its normal state as soon as possible, we convened a meeting of student representatives to give instructions. The students were able to understand and accept the school's painstaking efforts to persuade them, and expressed that they would resume classes immediately. However, after the meeting, there was a resolution to attend classes on a trial basis, which shows their lack of enthusiasm for their studies. Subsequently, the student union denied the resolution and submitted a request to postpone classes pending a re-vote. Such contradictory words and actions are disheartening to the teachers. The heads of the administrative departments of the school have expressed extreme disappointment with this frivolous behavior, and in accordance with their statement made to the students on that day, have jointly submitted their resignations. After earnest attempts to retain them proved unsuccessful, the school's administration was immediately plunged into a state of standstill. A school with forty years of honor is now on the verge of collapse, for which the students cannot shirk their responsibility. In addition to my traveling to Beijing overnight to personally seek instructions from the Ministry of Education, I am hereby publishing the joint resignation of the heads as follows. I urge the students to quickly realize their mistake, resume classes uniformly and immediately, so that the school situation can gradually return to peace and restore the proper course of education, and not fail to live up to the deep expectations of all the teachers and staff. This announcement is of utmost importance. President Dong Xifan, June 17th."</p>
<p>Resignation Letters</p>
<p>"To President Dong Xifan: The students of this school have been on strike for over a month. We have recently heard that they will cease the strike starting tomorrow, but they do not call it a resumption of classes, but rather a 'suspension,' which clearly shows that the students have no intention of resuming their studies. After the students went on strike, you twice issued notices ordering them to resume classes immediately, and we colleagues have also repeatedly advised them to focus on their studies, but our earnest words were ignored. How can we not sigh deeply! We colleagues are holding positions without fulfilling our responsibilities, and have failed the school. We hereby resign from our administrative positions to apologize to the school. We hope for your understanding. We respectfully wish you good health. Dean of Academic Affairs Xie Cangli, Dean of Student Affairs Ye Xuean, Dean of General Affairs Zhou Guanjun, Dean of the College of Engineering Jiang Hong, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Gu Baochang, concurrently Principal of the Affiliated Middle School Jiang Hong, concurrently Principal of the Affiliated Vocational School Hu Zhaoying."</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Students Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday, Hoping to Rescue Arrested Classmates</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Jiaotong University students, due to eighteen students of the school being included in the list of those to be arrested, among whom Yu Xikun and Yang Fusheng have already been detained, while the rest are scattered outside, afraid to return to the school. The students of the school held a memorial meeting in the gymnasium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Portraits of the eighteen students were hung in the meeting hall, each accompanied by a short biography. Old professor Chen Shiying attended and delivered a speech, comforting the students to calm their minds and return to classes as soon as possible, and conveyed Principal Wu Baofeng's opinion, saying that if the students continued to insist on not attending classes, summer vacation would begin on the 19th. The students stated that they would decide after the representatives who went to Beijing to petition return to Shanghai. When the reporter visited them last night, they explained that if the representatives who went to Beijing to petition could obtain a satisfactory response from the government, release the arrested students, and cancel the arrest warrants, they would definitely continue classes. If summer vacation has already started by then, how will the school handle it? Furthermore, the liaison department of the school's student union decided the day before yesterday to organize a visiting team of alumni and parents, and mobilized students to participate. After the memorial meeting was held yesterday, they set off separately to visit Jiaotong University alumni, requesting assistance in rescuing the arrested students.</p>

<h3>Seven Major Cities in the World Compete for the Next World Games; The International Olympic Committee Opens</h3>
<p>[United Press, Stockholm, Kurts, 6th] The International Olympic Committee opened here today, with a one-week session and an agenda of 27 items. One of the items is the issue of canceling the traditional Olympic salute, because it is similar to the fascist salute. According to the Secretary-General of the Committee, Swiss representative Ma Yi, Belgium advocates canceling the original salute, and Switzerland proposes replacing it with a new salute with the head turned to the right and both hands on both sides. Another item on the agenda is to choose the location for the 1952 Games. Ma Yi said that at least seven cities have applied to be the host. Representative delegations from the Finnish capital, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Detroit in the United States have been busy contacting each other before the committee meeting in order to obtain sponsorship. Committee members have lifelong tenure, so Germany and Japan are still among the 43 participating countries. Ma Yi said that the two countries were not invited and will continue to be ignored until their Olympic committees are fully restored.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 16th] The number of American cities competing to hold the 1952 Olympic World Games has increased to five. Philadelphia has also applied to hold the Games that year. Previously, there were Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Lake Placid in the United States and Da Peicha in Italy have requested to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. Sir Burgley, President of the British Olympic Association, is here to attend the International Olympic Committee and denies rumors that London's preparations for next year's World Games are inadequate. Bren Tai, Chairman of the US Olympic Committee, also confirmed that London's preparations are proceeding on schedule and expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 16th] The International Olympic Committee will meet in the Knights' Hall (formerly the Swedish Upper House) here on Wednesday, with 70 representatives from 23 countries participating. The selection of the location for the 1952 World Games is expected to be a fierce competition at the conference. Representatives from Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Detroit, and other cities in the United States have brought films and other promotional materials for the election. The 1932 World Games were held in Los Angeles, and the 1928 World Games were held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The 1940 World Games were originally scheduled to be held in Helsinki, Finland, but were not held due to the outbreak of the war. However, the sports fields have already been built, so Helsinki has a better chance of being elected. The British representative has expressed his willingness to support Finland, believing that Finland has produced a lot of sports talent, and the Olympic movement should not only be based on money, but should also give small countries an equal opportunity. However, other representatives feel that Finland's political situation is unstable, so they are skeptical about whether Finland will succeed. Stockholm also intends to compete for the election, but does not want to compete with Helsinki, so it does not intend to take any action until it knows whether Helsinki has applied.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Stockholm, 15th] On the eve of the meeting of the International Sports Federation Committee, delegations from various countries have gathered here. According to Nordic observers, American delegations are vying fiercely for the location of the 1952 Games, but Helsinki may be designated as the location of the Games. Bernard, the chief British representative, said: "Today's sports are too focused on money, and the Berlin Games were completely focused on propaganda. This is mostly the case for the Games held in big countries. Therefore, it is best to hold the Games in small countries. From now on, we should strive to restore the ancient spirit of the Games."</p>

<h3>Second Division Table Tennis League: Jing Wu Sweeps to Victory; Tonight Siming Green Team Competes for Fourth Division Runner-Up</h3>
<p>The third Shanghai Table Tennis League finals were held the night before last at 8:00 PM in the Central Auditorium between Jing Wu and Hua Lian Hua from the Second Division. Over 500 spectators attended. Chen Linsheng and Shen Bohong served as referees. Hua Lian Hua's morale was dampened due to the absence of their team captain, Li Feixiang, resulting in reduced fighting spirit. Moreover, their lineup was predictable, making victory difficult. However, the second and third matches were extremely tense. Hua Lian Hua veteran Zhou Weixin fought valiantly against Jing Wu's main player, Zhang Fuzhang. Zhang Fuzhang, young and strong, excelled in both smashing and cutting. His skills are now approaching those of a first-class player. Despite facing the threat of the opponent's fast close-range blocking, he ultimately relied on his hard smash to win 3-1. In the third match, Jing Wu's defensive player Chen Zengliang performed poorly and was constantly behind due to the opponent Xu Zhibo's fierce attacks. The two fought fiercely for five games, and Chen managed to secure the final victory thanks to good luck. In the fifth match, Jing Wu's defensive player Shui Hanguo also succeeded. In the sixth match, Hua Lian Hua captain Li Feixiang arrived and defeated Jing Wu captain Han Dexuan 3-0, scoring a point and making amends for his absence. As a result, Jing Wu defeated Hua Lian Hua 6-1, winning the Second Division championship, while Hua Lian Hua finished as runner-up.

<h3>No Personnel Issues for the Textile Adjustment Committee; Establishment Possible This Weekend; Zhang Jia'ao Invited Committee Members to Exchange Views Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Affairs Ministry's Textile Industry Adjustment Committee has been steadily progressing towards its establishment. All personnel issues have been resolved. The official establishment date will be this weekend. Minister Chen of the Economic Affairs Ministry will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the event. The committee's office will be located at 24 Tumingyuan Road in this city.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, hosted a luncheon yesterday at his residence for the members of the Economic Affairs Ministry's Textile Adjustment Committee. Over ten people attended, including Zou Chengwen, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, and Guo Dihuo.

<h3>Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks; Yong Yarn Awakens Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw continued rumors about the prospects of delivery, making the overall situation even more chaotic. Despite repeated increases in margin by industry insiders, the upward trend was not widespread. Only Yong Yarn progressed steadily, while other stocks declined. This is due to the authorities' neglect of the stock exchange, creating uncertainty. Outside investors remain hesitant. The phenomenon of Yong Yarn's lone strength is also unsustainable. Before the settlement date, there is a lot of floating stock. Futures brokers raised interest rates to as high as 3.45 and 3.9 fen. Further rapid progress is unlikely. The sudden increase in Yong Yarn near closing was purely the work of major players and is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The market opened slightly weak due to the National Bank's intervention the previous day and reports that senior officials from the Securities Exchange had been summoned to Beijing, with unfavorable rumors circulating. After Yong Yarn opened, brokers 2, 160, 220, 200, and 172 sold down to 6950 yuan. Brokers 85, 106, 23, 119, 97, 89, 83, 223, 163, 148, 76, 125, 207, 122, 231, 1299, 224, and 217 all bought aggressively. Within fifteen minutes, the market price suddenly jumped by over 500 yuan, with deferred water yarn rising to 7500 yuan. Brokers 143, 94, 54, 126, 76, and 188 sold at the high price of 7370 yuan. Brokers 143, 207, 89, 152, 117, 223, 107, 104, and 44 also bought. Lianhua Real Estate continued to hit the price limit, and deferred Yong Yarn rose back to 7500 yuan. Brokers 181, 8, 65, 160, 85, 185, and 102 sold again at 7320 yuan. Later, broker 152 bought spot Yong Yarn, and brokers 224 and 105 also bought up to 7500 yuan. However, as speculative stocks and miscellaneous stocks declined across the board, Yong Yarn was ultimately unable to sustain the gains. Moreover, spot brokers offered interest rates as high as 3.45 to 3.9 fen. Brokers 83, 65, and 89 sold again at 7320 yuan. Afterwards, rumors suddenly spread that the settlement could be extended to the end of September and that the Securities Finance Corporation would use a combination of 30% cash and U.S. dollar bonds. If the account balance exceeded 6 billion, an additional 20% of stock would be required. At 10:45 AM, buying interest resurged, with brokers 199, 224, 232, 119, 97, 152, and 85 buying up to 7550 yuan. Brokers 76, 148, 156, 142, and 157 sold within the range of 7300 yuan, and broker 94 bought slightly. There was a pause of about half an hour at this time. At 12:00 PM, Commercial Press Match hit the price limit on the downside, with brokers 69 and 91 separately selling. Brokers 163, 76, 89, 142, and 156 sold within the range of 7200 yuan. Brokers 224, 223, 8, and 190 bought at the low price. In the final moment before closing, deferred Yong Yarn ended at 7450 yuan due to buying by brokers 231 and 152. After closing, the price was quoted down to around 7350 yuan. The overall result was that Yong Yarn rose slightly, while Xinguang, Hua Nong, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhe declined slightly. Meiya was unchanged. Zhongfa and Xinhua fell slightly. Lianhua Real Estate continued to hit the price limit. Guohuo, Datong, and Wuhe fell slightly. Jing, Zhongsi, and Xinya fell by 10%. Cement rose slightly. Commercial Press Match hit the price limit on the downside but recovered, falling slightly to 10% weaker. Lian An was unchanged, and the rest declined slightly. Deferred Yong Yarn rose slightly, and Xinhe rose slightly. Qinxing, Jingfu, Yonggong, and Meiya declined slightly. Xinguang and Huafeng fell slightly. Old stocks outside the market declined slightly across the board.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhixin and Others Return to Shanghai; Secret Remains Unbroken; Many Rumors Circulating in the Market</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Securities Exchange, along with Assistant Managers Yang Pu and Gu Shanchang, returned to Shanghai yesterday from Beijing. It is reported that Wang and his colleagues had detailed discussions with Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance; Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department; Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Economic Affairs Ministry; and the relevant section chiefs from both ministries. Wang and his colleagues presented the current impact of the stock exchange market on prices, interest rates, and financial stability, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of deferred transactions, in detail to the authorities. The two ministries stated that they should wait quietly for the ministry's orders to be issued and implemented regarding new measures for the Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is widely rumored among brokers: (1) Deferred transactions will be extended for another three months until the end of September of this year. (2) For the deposit portion of deferred transactions, cash and U.S. dollar bonds can still be used simultaneously. (3) For deferred transaction amounts exceeding 6 billion yuan, an additional 20% deposit must be paid, and this additional deposit can be paid with listed stocks and U.S. dollar bonds. When the reporter inquired with a spokesperson from the Securities Exchange about these rumors, the spokesperson stated that they had not heard anything about it.</p>
<h3>National Bonds and Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds were slightly weak yesterday, with a turnover of only over 4 million, and narrow price fluctuations. Unified Class C bonds opened at 7300, reached a high of 7500, a low of 6900, and finally struggled around 7300. Foreign firms and room 503 were buying, while rooms 360 and 230 were selling. As a result, Classes A, B, and E all fell by 200 yuan compared to the previous close, and Classes D and C fell by 300 yuan each.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially rose and then fell yesterday. Yisha opened at 72,500 yuan and ended at 69,000 yuan. Small investors were selling slightly, and the Guangdong firms were also selling Yisha. Foreign firms and gold dealers were buying, and trading volume was not high. Hong Kong-Shanghai Telegraph was 14.4 yuan, with little impact. As a result, shipping rose, while Yisha, paper, and industry services all fell slightly, and the British Union, Germany, and declined slightly. Yisha, steel, and telephone were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Flows from Tianjin to Shanghai, Reaching Over Tens of Billions of Yuan</h3>
<p>In recent days, a large amount of floating capital has flowed into the Shanghai market from Tianjin. Commercial banks and money shops have received a large number of remittances from there every day. The exact amount is impossible to estimate, but it is believed to be in the tens of billions of yuan. It is reported that this floating capital is all flowing through Shanghai to escape to Hong Kong. It does not stay in Shanghai for long and continues to escape to Hong Kong by various means. Therefore, it is unlikely to put pressure on Shanghai prices. It is reported that part of this floating capital originated from the Northeast and flowed to Tianjin before being transferred, and part of it is funds from Tianjin and other cities in northern China.</p>
<h3>Future Silk Exports Will Primarily Be Based on Barter; Government Decides to Support the Development of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The purchase of spring cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has come to an end. Dried cocoons have also been entering warehouses one after another, ready for silk reeling. The issue of outlets for the reeled silk is currently being planned by relevant agencies such as the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Silk Corporation. It is reported that future export methods will be based on barter with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Currently under consideration is bartering with the United States for rayon and bartering with Vietnam for rice. The barter plan with the United States proposes to export 1,500 piculs of raw silk to the United States each month. Based on the current price difference between American raw silk and rayon, approximately 7,000 boxes of rayon can be obtained each month. China is currently experiencing a shortage of rayon, and market prices are soaring. It is estimated that exporting 10,000 piculs of raw silk to the United States will be sufficient to meet the national demand for rayon for one year. (Currently, China's monthly consumption of rayon is only 3,000 boxes). Therefore, with this barter supply of rayon, a portion of the raw material problems for the silk weaving industry can be solved.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics will also establish a design committee to study the barter of raw silk with foreign countries, so that the results of the research can be offered to the authorities for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Corporation, stated that the government will not hesitate to invest heavily in supporting the development of the silk industry, as this move is related to the revitalization of the rural economy and can increase exports.</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoon purchase considered the costs of silk farmers, and the future of the silk industry has shown a glimmer of hope. Silk farmers have regained their original interest in the cultivation of mulberry trees and other aspects. Therefore, it is estimated that the future cocoon production will exceed pre-war levels.</p>
<p>The authorities' adoption of silk fabrics and rayon helps silk exports, so they are doing their best to facilitate it. However, in the future, the rayon needed by the industry must contribute to exports, and at least the same amount of foreign exchange should be recovered. In addition, the company is planning to support the revival of the silk industry in various parts of Guangdong. The company will send two technicians to work there.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stabilizes; Cooking Oil Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received 6,100 piculs of rice. The northern market was weak in the morning and tight in the afternoon.

The first batch of Sichuan indica rice arrived in Shanghai and was of good quality.</p>

However, unified flour sales were still acceptable, rising by 1-2,000 yuan. Bran offerings from factories were scarce. Rural sales continued, rising by another 4-5,000 yuan. New wheat demand from factories increased, rising by 7-8,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Six District Cotton Textile Association Submits Policy Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association recently submitted four recommendations to the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, hoping that the committee would review and adopt them. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Under the principle of free operation of the textile industry, the committee, under the mandate of the government, shall supervise state-owned and private factories, plan for the increased production and supply of raw cotton, adjust the supply of finished products to stabilize market prices, and strive for foreign markets to achieve the rational development of the entire textile industry.</p>
<p>2.  To ensure the cooperation of state-owned and private factories, the supervisors of the committee should be jointly involved in the work with private factories.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding finance, fuel coal, raw materials, sales, and withdrawal, under the principle of fairness, private factories should receive the same treatment as state-owned factories regarding the convenience obtained by the former state-owned factories.</p>
<p>4.  The measures of the former Textile Management Committee that are inconsistent with the adjustment principle should be abolished immediately.</p>
<h3>Local Needle Manufacturing Industry Production Far Below Previous Levels; Raw Material Shortages Significantly Impact Costs</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the current production of the local needle manufacturing industry is only 54% of its highest output, and there is still room for active improvement. The main raw materials for the needle manufacturing industry are wire rod and wire rod skin. Before the war, domestic production was not possible, and all were imported from countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Belgium. After the government implemented import controls after the war, the source has become increasingly tight. In addition to the raw materials stored by each factory, the only way to purchase them is at a high price from households, which has a significant impact on the cost of products. The only hope now lies in the resumption of work of domestic public and private steel plants, so that they can supply the necessary raw materials.</p>
<p>As for sales, it can be discussed in three aspects: (1) The sales of sewing needles. Before the war, it was about 28,800 boxes per year, of which 60% were sold to India and Southeast Asia, and the rest were used domestically. The supply and demand situation has changed slightly after the war. The annual output in 1946 was 9,600 boxes, a quarter of which were for domestic sales, and the rest were all for export. Calculated at the current average market price, each box is calculated at 4.5 million yuan, and the total value can reach over 34.5 billion yuan, equivalent to about 2.8 million US dollars; if calculated at the highest output, exports can reach more than 17,200 boxes, and the total value is about 6.5 million US dollars.</p>
<p>(2) The sales of hosiery needles and knitting needles. Before the war, the annual output was 48 million to 60 million pieces. Because domestic demand exceeded supply, there were no exports. After the war, domestic demand decreased, and there was a surplus for export. The current domestic and foreign sales are roughly equal. According to the statistics of 1946, the total export value can reach 10 billion yuan, equivalent to 830,000 US dollars; calculated at the maximum output, the export value can be increased to 81.5 million yuan. (3) Safety pins and phonograph needles, because the output is not enough for domestic sales, there are currently no exports.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Sales Market Warming Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw strong demand for 20-count coarse yarn from Hankou and other out-of-town dyehouses and textile factories, so the spot price rose to 8.9 million, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Double horse yarn rose by 150,000 yuan. Sales of 42-count and 40-count fine yarn were sluggish, with only slight increases. The rest of the 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan overall.</p>
<p>Spinning Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth yesterday as usual, selling a total of 26,465 bolts of cloth and 280 blankets. Domestic manufacturers submitted 67 purchase orders, purchasing a total of 3,625 bolts of cloth. Cloth merchants submitted 853 purchase orders, purchasing a total of 23,840 bolts of cloth and 280 blankets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Director Jiang of the China Textile Construction Company's business department, the supply of 12-pound Nengtou fine cloth will be temporarily suspended, because it must be allocated to the Central Bank for purchase and export. Other fine cloths are supplied as usual. The time when supply will resume depends on future circumstances.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Conditions Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market saw improved actual sales of cotton yarn, and yarn prices continued to rise from Monday's upward trend, so confidence was firm. Holders were unwilling to sell easily, and yarn factories and out-of-town merchants were also adding to their inventories, so market conditions showed a stable trend.

Because of the cotton shortage in Shanghai and Qingdao, they have ordered American cotton from abroad. After many appeals, the ban has recently been lifted, but the Four Banks and the Rain Bureau have suddenly stopped cotton industry loans, putting the industry in a dying state. The association has invited the press to appeal for assistance on their behalf.</p>

Old Knife brand cigarettes were also down 110,000 yuan, and Wu Hua brand was down 50,000 yuan. Hartmen fell sharply by 200,000 yuan due to oversupply. The trend of the cigarette market throughout the day was downstream again. The price of Chinese merchant strip cigarettes also fell by 100 to 800 yuan. Higher-end cigarettes such as Da Nan, Da San Pao, and others were also being sold off, falling by 1,500 to 3,000 yuan.

<p>Sales of matches were not very smooth. Colleagues were under pressure from money and all took a wait-and-see approach, resulting in declines of 10,000 to 3-45,000 yuan. Only the Mei Li brand market was firmer.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Round Longan Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous large round longan continue to rise because the arrival stock is extremely scarce and the production area inventory is about to be cut off, so the trend is still tight even though sales are small. Yesterday, several hundred pieces were opened, and it rose another 4-50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>After the Resumption of Private Trade by Japan, Sino-Japanese Trade is Unlikely to Expand: Yang Jinsheng Returns to Shanghai and Discusses Three Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Jinsheng, Deputy Manager of the Central Trust Bureau and Commercial Advisor to the Delegation to Japan, recently went to Japan on official business. After a month and a half, he returned to this port by ship on the 16th. According to Mr. Yang, speaking to a reporter from the United Credit Information Service, the negotiations with MacArthur's headquarters on barter trade were extremely successful. Whether there will be new developments in the future will depend on government policy. Rayon is still being shipped continuously. The amount of salt to be exported to Japan this year is estimated at one million tons. However, due to transportation issues, this has been affected, and at most one million tons can be shipped this year. Regarding the opening of private trade with Japan, Mr. Yang said that the US government has decided that the distribution of official representatives on August 15 will be determined by the Allied Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Trade Bureau. After the representatives of the merchants are determined, they can contact Japanese manufacturers without restriction. The types, quantities, and prices of trade goods are all determined by MacArthur's headquarters. Furthermore, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen will not be fixed in advance but will be determined after the circulation of various commodities. Before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, this is a partial lifting of the economic blockade against Japan. Mr. Yang then expressed his views on the prospects of our imports and exports after the resumption of private trade by Japan. Mr. Yang believes that there are still many difficulties: (1) There is no foreign exchange rate. During trade, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen is uncertain, and our foreign exchange is controlled by the government. Our importers cannot deliver US dollars or British pounds to exchange for Japanese goods. (2) The prices of goods traded with Japan must be approved by MacArthur's headquarters. Currently, the cost of our export commodities is very high. If MacArthur's headquarters does not calculate according to the actual cost during trade, our merchants will suffer huge losses. (3) China and Japan need mostly the same goods. Currently, Japan is willing to export raw silk, textiles, etc., and our exports to Japan are roughly the same. As for fuel and food, we cannot meet their needs. This is the biggest difficulty after the resumption of private trade by Japan. Mr. Yang also said that under such circumstances, most of the trade will still be conducted between governments.</p>
<p>In another report, it is learned that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan has decided to partially open Japanese trade in August this year, which is of great concern to the people of our country. It is understood that since Japan's surrender, although there have been trade exchanges with our country, they have all been conducted through barter. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for overall planning. After the opening of Japanese trade this autumn, our trade relations with it can still maintain the existing mode, with internal government control. Although there are private exchanges, they must be strictly reviewed by the government. Therefore, the general concern that Japanese industrial manufactured goods will be imported in large quantities is an overstatement.</p>

<h3>Fierce Wind Sweeps Away Dirty Clouds: Henan Province Actively Launches Anti-Corruption Campaign</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Kaifeng, 13th. Our reporter, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>The Cloud of Corruption</p>
<p>In today's political sky, shrouded in corruption, the officials and people of Henan have jointly launched an anti-corruption campaign, which is very exciting. Many people are watching with sharp eyes, waiting for the possible effects of this campaign.</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial New Life Movement Association has designated next week as the anti-corruption campaign promotion week. Starting from the 15th, every afternoon at 8:00 PM, leaders of the party, government, and organizations, as well as leaders from all walks of life and social activists, will be invited to give radio speeches in turn. Chairman Chen Ling of the Provincial Party Headquarters will give the first day's broadcast, talking about eliminating corruption and changing social customs. On the second day, Director Hu Changyi of the Youth League Branch will talk about eliminating corruption and the New Life Movement. On the third day, Speaker Ji Xue of the Provincial Assembly will discuss eliminating corruption and revitalizing China. On the fourth day, Director Zhang Xinnan of the Civil Affairs Department will talk about how to eliminate corruption. On the fifth day, Secretary-General Ma Lingfu of the Provincial Government will talk about eliminating corruption and purifying officialdom. On the sixth day, Supervisor Guo Zhongkui of Henan and Shandong will talk about eliminating corruption and building the nation. On the seventh day, President Zhou Yuzi of the High Court will talk about eliminating corruption and rectifying people's hearts. From these broadcast topics, people commonly feel that no matter from which aspect, corruption should be eliminated as soon as possible! Therefore, in theory, "eliminating corruption" has almost become a universally shared requirement. What people urgently demand is the practical implementation.</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Assembly has never neglected this point. In order to protect the government and to protect the locality, they have not only vociferously called for the elimination of corruption in theory, but they have also not been negligent or sloppy in action. They have organized an investigation team, which has been meeting day and night recently to discuss work steps. After several discussions, they decided to first investigate the Henan Provincial Health Department.</p>
<p>The assembly members participating in this investigation are Liu Yan, Lü Yunru, Dai Xiangqu, Wang Junjie, Zhang Xiran, Qiao Zhaoran, Lu Jili, etc. Because they needed to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the department, they also invited Li Chaoyang from the accounting office of the Provincial Government Secretariat and Gao Jiannong from the accounting office of the Accounting Department to go together. At the same time, they also invited Shangguan Wu, the director of the Provincial Kaifeng Hospital, Yan Zhongyi, the director of the Provincial Zhengzhou Hospital, and Gan Yi, the director of the Infectious Disease Hospital, to the department at 9:00 AM yesterday for investigation.</p>
<p>This group of iron-faced and selfless representatives of public opinion marched into the Health Department. According to Director Shi Guopan of the department, Cao Huanzhang, the warehouse manager of the department's pharmacy, had escaped the day before yesterday. The investigation team had to focus on investigating the warehouse. Therefore, Sun, the chief of the department's second section, accompanied them to inspect the medicines in the warehouse. In the four dark and small warehouses, there were only a few crude medicines, arranged in a mess. The original vouchers were gone, and the payment figures were also unclear. Warehouse manager Sun Ji and secretary Zhi were vague and evasive. They did not know the details of all the accounts. The team had no choice but to seal up the warehouse, take away eight volumes of registration certificates for existing drug receipts and issues, and are now checking them. The team also held a meeting on this matter in the morning. According to the China Times here today, Shi Guopan of the Health Department is suspected of serious corruption.</p>
<p>The report stated, "...Shi Guopan, a native of Jiangsu, was appointed director of the Health Department in the 31st year of the Republic. At that time, the provincial government was still located in Luoyang. A special committee was established to handle the receipt and distribution of medicines, and Shi, as the chairman, was responsible for convening meetings. However, after the provincial government moved to Xiangshan, Shi claimed that it was not easy to convene meetings, and the committee became a mere formality. At that time, the medicines of the International Red Cross Society were constantly arriving, and ordinary medicines such as quinine pills and aspirin often numbered in the hundreds of thousands of tablets each time. After the provincial government moved to Wanxi for the third time, the traffic between Wanxi and Xi'an was frequent, and the Health Department also often sent people back and forth between Henan and Shaanxi, which inevitably raised suspicions. After the restoration, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration also often delivered medicines to the department for distribution to various counties, but those who came to the counties to collect them often returned disappointed. For example, penicillin, which the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally designated as non-saleable, was delivered to the department in 800 doses for free injection to patients, but now its whereabouts are unknown, and the loss of other medicines is even more impossible to calculate."</p>
<p>According to a colleague of the investigation team, Shi Guopan is indeed suspected of corruption based on evidence. The escape of warehouse manager Cao Huanzhang was also instigated by someone. Before escaping, he had handed over 18 boxes of medicines to Guangji Pharmacy to sell on his behalf.</p>
<p>This case is currently under investigation. This case is also the beginning of the investigation team's work. The government is assisting them, and the people are supporting them. Their work may proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results. As long as the determination is consistent, it is believed that this huge wind will surely sweep away the dirty clouds of corruption, allowing the clear blue political sky to reappear over Henan.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Tianjin, 8th. Xing Qixin</p>
<p>Three-Year Plan</p>
<p>The New Port project, after inheriting the unfinished work and the stagnation and destruction by the Japanese, slightly started in the 35th year of the Republic. However, for the completion of the entire project, it is necessary to lay its foundation within the initial three years to open the way for future expansion. The work during these three years will focus on dredging and breakwater construction. Other supporting projects such as completing the dry dock, expanding the shipyard, paving railways and highways, and purchasing machinery and ships are also urgent tasks. In addition, it is necessary to coordinate and connect with the railway and highway aspects at any time to complete water-land combined transportation, so as to build and operate simultaneously to achieve the effect of investment. After the completion of this three-year plan, the future direction will be determined based on the industrial and commercial development of Tianjin and Tanggu to achieve the task of completing the port construction.</p>
<p>The quantity of work in the three-year plan and the overall effects after completion are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Important Tasks</p>
<p>(1) Breakwater: Consolidate the existing south breakwater with a length of 4,500 meters and the north breakwater with a length of 3,800 meters. Speed up the completion of the unfinished stone dike, estimated to require 120,000 cubic meters of stone and 12,000 cubic meters of cement blocks, and drive single-line steel sheet piles for 1,650 meters.</p>
<p>(2) Navigation Channel: Dredge the main channel in the port to a width of 70 meters and a depth of 6 meters. Deepen the area in front of the first wharf to 6 meters, deepen the area in front of the second wharf to 8 meters, and deepen the east and west entrances of the ship lock to 5 meters.</p>
<p>(3) Wharf: The second wharf has two original coal loading machines, which will be repaired and used. The barge wharf to the east is 370 meters long and is about 25% complete. It is planned to be completed this year for use. In addition, the dredged silt will be used to fill and build a material wharf. This year, a 300-meter revetment will be built first.</p>
<p>(4) Filling: The wharf base is filled with dredged mud and sand using mud discharge pipes. It is estimated that 1.7 million cubic meters will be completed this year. Calculated at an average height of 4 meters, it can provide more than 700 mu of wharf land. However, this newly filled land will not be usable until three years later.</p>
<p>(5) Ship Lock: Leveling the ground near the ship lock still requires 20,000 cubic meters of earth. The electrical equipment in the existing ship lock control room is temporary equipment. It is planned to bring in the original designed electrical control equipment from Japan to replace it. In addition, two sets of floating boats for water blocking should be prepared on both sides of the ship lock for use in repairing the gate when it is damaged.</p>
<p>(6) Land Equipment: For loading and unloading equipment, it is planned to add two 3-ton and two 25-ton cranes first, and the existing 10 kilometers of railway will be consolidated. If necessary, it is planned to build another 11 kilometers. It is also planned to build another 5 kilometers of highway.</p>
<p>(7) Electrical Equipment: When the Japanese built the port, they built a second transformer station with 12,000 KVA capacity and high-voltage lines, etc. It was originally designed for dredgers to work at the eastern end of the port wharf, far from the shore. It has long been completely destroyed. Currently, there is only one 2,400 KVA transformer station. Not only can all the dredgers not be started at the same time, but even after the machine factory is expanded, it may only be able to meet the needs of the machine factory's work. Therefore, it is necessary to add a 6,000 KVA transformer station and add four sets of 1,000 KVA generators to generate electricity by themselves to facilitate work.</p>
<p>(8) Dock and Ships: Dredging work is extremely important to maintain the smooth flow of the port channel, even in peacetime. In addition to repairing the existing ships, it is planned to purchase or lease one or two large suction dredgers. In addition, for winter freezing, it is planned to purchase one or two icebreakers for dredging and icebreaking. However, for the repair of damaged ships, the Japanese previously used docks at Dagu Shipyard and Taikoo Dockyard. After the victory, each of these docks was recovered by the original owner. The new port has no such equipment at all, making ship repair extremely difficult. This year, it is planned to complete a 2,000-ton dry dock that was not completed by the Japanese and add a simple shipyard. Add machine factory working machinery and ships for soil transportation and water supply to cooperate with the progress of the project. In addition, more than ten barges and tugboats will be added to facilitate transportation and complete water-land combined transportation.</p>
<p>(9) Water Supply and Drainage Equipment: Add a water pool and bury 5,000 meters of water pipes.</p>
<p>(10) Navigation Markers: Add 22 buoys, 11 self-luminous buoys, 2 lighthouses, 2 fog signals, 6 light beacons, and 3 signals, which will be distributed in the port to facilitate navigation.</p>
<p>Various Effects</p>
<p>After the completion of this year's project, the following effects can be achieved:</p>
<p>(1) 3,000-ton ships can pass through the ship lock to and from Tianjin at any time.</p>
<p>(2) The first wharf can simultaneously berth five to seven 3,000-ton ships or ships with a draft of less than 5 meters, with an estimated annual loading and unloading volume of approximately 1 million tons.</p>
<p>(3) The coal loading yard at the second wharf can load and unload approximately 1 million tons of coal annually. Coal produced from Datong and Jingxing mines can be loaded and transported for export through the new port.</p>
<p>(4) The barge wharf can be completed.</p>
<p>(5) The revetment of the fuel wharf can be completed.</p>
<p>(6) The dry dock and shipyard equipment are completed, which is sufficient for the repair of self-use ships.</p>
<p>(7) The warehouse can store 15,000 tons of cargo.</p>
<p>(8) The transportation business can load and unload goods from large ships anchored outside Dagukou.</p>
<p>(9) The initial completion of water-land combined transportation.</p>
<p>37th Year of the Republic (1948)</p>
<p>(1) Breakwater: Continue the unfinished project of the 36th year, throwing approximately 146,000 cubic meters of stone and adding 65,000 cubic meters of cement blocks. In addition, single-line steel sheet piles will be driven from 4 meters to 7 meters below the Dagu zero point on the north and south breakwaters, and double-line steel sheet piles will be driven from 7 meters to 8 meters. The total length of the north and south is 7,300 meters, totaling 115,000 tons, and 65,000 tons will be constructed in the 37th year.</p>
<p>(2) Channel and Berth: Widen the channel by 30 meters, deepen it to 8 meters, and deepen two deep-water berths to 11 meters.</p>
<p>(3) Ships: Purchase one dredger and one icebreaker each.</p>
<p>(4) Water Supply and Drainage: Bury 10,000 meters of water pipes and other water supply projects, and install cement pipes for drainage and auxiliary equipment.</p>
<p>(5) Railway and Highway: Maintain old railway and highway roads and build 4 kilometers more.</p>
<p>(6) Electrical Equipment: Supplement the equipment and power lines of the new transformer station built in the 36th year.</p>
<p>(7) Filling: Use dredged soil to fill approximately 3.2 million cubic meters.</p>
<p>After the completion of the work plan in the 37th year, the following effects can be achieved:</p>
<p>(1) Ten-thousand-ton ocean giants can anchor two ships in deep water berths.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the breakwater will be completed, which can prevent siltation and wind and wave attacks.</p>
<p>(3) The wind and waves in the port are relatively calm, making barge transportation convenient.</p>
<p>38th Year of the Republic (1949)</p>
<p>(1) Breakwater: Complete the unfinished projects of the 36th and 37th years on the north and south breakwaters, including adding approximately 18,000 cubic meters of cement blocks and 50,000 tons of steel sheet piles.</p>
<p>(2) Channel and Berth: Widen the channel by another 30 meters, for a total width of 130 meters, and deepen it to 8 meters. Add two deep-water berths and deepen them to 11 meters.</p>
<p>(3) Filling: Use dredged soil to fill 1.6 million cubic meters.</p>
<p>(4) Railway: Build 4.5 kilometers of railway.</p>
<p>(5) Loading and Unloading Equipment: Add four 3-ton cranes, two 10-ton cranes, six 1- to 3-ton cranes, and one 150-ton crane.</p>
<p>After the completion of the work plan in the 38th year, the following effects can be achieved:</p>
<p>(1) Four 30,000-ton ocean giants can be berthed in the port at the same time.</p>
<p>(2) The breakwater is completely completed, and the port base is gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>(3) The port's shipping facilities are completed.</p>
<p>(4) Coastal ships can be repaired and built.</p>
<p>(5) The sea-land transportation plan is completed.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>The original purpose of the Japanese in building the new port was to export mainly bauxite and other materials to Japan and import finished products to China. It had nothing to do with China's economy and international trade. Now that the new port has been taken back and built by our country, we should consider our country's economic situation, foreign trade, and the needs of industry and commerce in North China, examine its gains and losses, measure its urgency, and revise the project plan. According to the opinions of Chinese and American experts and the results of surveys and research, it is generally believed that the new port project should first focus on basic facilities and lay the foundation for future expansion, so as not to deviate from the principles of economic construction.</p>
<p>In the 35th year of the Republic, the New Port project only reorganized damaged equipment and houses and completed a part of the project that had been started but not completed by the Japanese. In the next three years, efforts will be made to build the basic facilities of the New Port project to meet the transportation of passengers and goods in the North China area. After that, the expansion plan will be determined based on the transportation situation between Tianjin and Tanggu and the prosperity of industry and commerce in North China so as to suit the actual situation and gradually develop.</p>
<p>As for the throughput of goods, the original plan of the Japanese was quite large, with the goal of building an annual throughput of 27 million tons of coal, salt, iron ore, bauxite, and sundries. The first phase of the project was aimed at 8 million tons, and the construction was less than half completed in five years. Now, according to the three-year plan, the annual throughput will be 2 million tons after completion. If the loading and unloading equipment is complete, it can reach 4 million tons. In the future, more wharves will be built, and transportation facilities will be strengthened, which is expected to increase to 12 million tons, occupying a very important position among the ports in the country.</p>
<p>The unfinished base left by the Japanese in building the port is quite vast. In the future, it will be gradually repaired and coordinated with urban construction, which will surely become a prosperous urban area. Then, it will develop northward to Beitang at the mouth of the Ji Canal, and the area will be further expanded. Therefore, the future new port will surely become an important port for international trade in the North Pacific.</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Righteousness and Abundant Reason: A Scene of the Chengdu Student Movement</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Chengdu, 11th. Our reporter, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>The nationwide student movement that shook the country was not as enthusiastic in Chengdu as imagined by some conspirators. The righteousness of the students washed away the ambitions of the schemers. Furthermore, the automatic discovery of the student community exposed the international student movement conspiracy, forcing the schemers to disappear and calming Chengdu, which finally passed peacefully through this student movement.</p>
<p>Amidst the Student Movement</p>
<p>Chengdu's Special Performance</p>
<p>While the student movements in Beijing and Shanghai were boiling and intense, the student community in Chengdu showed calmness and reason. Although a small number of middle schools once醞釀 (yùnniàng - brewed) a strike, they were soon persuaded by the righteousness of the students in all universities and middle schools. During this period, the student unions of universities such as Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University, as well as vocational schools such as the Provincial Accounting School, Art School, and Sports School, sent telegrams to students in Beijing and Shanghai, hoping that they would understand the country's difficulties, not be used by parties, and maintain the glorious achievements of the student movement since the May Fourth Movement. After the central government announced measures to maintain social order, 24 cultural and academic organizations in Sichuan University and Chenghua University sent telegrams expressing their support and advising students in Beijing and Shanghai not to take radical actions, stop striking, and wait for the government to handle the matter fairly. At the same time, all schools in the city expressed a unanimous opinion, resolutely opposing the use of strikes and parades as a means to disrupt young people's studies. As a result, the schemers' tricks of discord could not be used.</p>
<p>The Strike Conspiracy</p>
<p>Did Not Materialize</p>
<p>On the eve of "June 2nd," some conspirators attempted to instigate strikes and parades in some schools on "June 2nd." Fei Erbu, a Western professor at Huada, presided over a rally to mobilize strikes among students from major universities and middle schools. However, few people attended, only 26 students from five schools including Huada, West China High School, and Zhonghua Women's High School. They decided to launch a strike and parade on "June 2nd" and expand the creation of bloodshed. Disputes arose on the spot due to differences of opinion. At the same time, many passionate university and middle school students were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and immediately drafted and posted hundreds of emergency bulletins throughout the city, listing the contents of the meeting and the donation conspiracy. As a result, anger spread throughout the student community. On the afternoon of the same day, representatives from 38 units of major universities and middle schools in the city, a total of more than 400 people, held a grand rally for the school protection movement at Qilu University. Amidst indignant and enthusiastic emotions, they resolved: (1) to establish the Chengdu Municipal Major Universities and Middle Schools Anti-Strike and Anti-Riot Movement Assembly, (2) to telegram students across the country, (3) to telegraph condolences to injured students in Beijing and Shanghai who protected their schools. The students at the meeting made generous donations on the spot and immediately raised a large sum of money to send to Beijing to express their condolences to the injured students. The entire venue shouted slogans such as: "Oppose 'eating all,'" "Hunger," "Three Strikes," and "Down with conspirators who use young people to create student movements!" The voice of justice resounded throughout Chengdu.</p>
<p>The Just Struggle</p>
<p>Exposes Foreign Conspiracy</p>
<p>Due to the sense of justice of these students, they immediately received the full support of more than 100,000 students from major universities and middle schools in the city. The schemers had no choice but to retreat, and the planned "June 2nd" strike and parade were temporarily called off. "June 2nd"! This tense day passed peacefully. Afterwards, Fei Erbu sent a letter to the Central News Agency, stating that he was only a religious and literary teacher, had no party background, and presided over the strike rally purely due to misunderstanding. However, the next day, students who had witnessed the meeting publicly refuted it, listing the details of the meeting and proving that Fei was indeed a core member, and demanded that the government ask Fei to leave Chengdu. This major case has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>In the Theater</h3>
<p>— Yang Wen</p>
<p>I heard booing again in a movie theater.</p>
<p>The sound was so familiar; after thinking about it carefully, I realized I often heard it in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Living in that mountain city for six or seven years, life was naturally quite boring, especially on evenings of chilling winds and bitter rain, when time was even harder to pass. Gradually, I learned to go to the “Ascending Peace Drum Song” hall to listen to Fuguihua (a performer), remembering that initially it cost five jiao to steep a cup of tea and sit until late at night. When the performance ended, I would come out with the crowd, and the midnight streets were quiet, the streetlights casting long, faint shadows. Perhaps a drizzle was still falling, which only added to the poetic feeling. After turning a few corners, the pedestrians walking along the road became fewer and fewer, until finally only one person was left, accompanied by their own shadow. There was not a sound on the road except for my own footsteps. I loved the quiet, secluded roads late at night, and sometimes even sat silently in the theater for hours just to savor this atmosphere.</p>
<p>The plays or movies in the theater were not necessarily satisfying. The most uncomfortable things were the applause and boos, especially directed at the characters on the screen.</p>
<p>I heard about it from others at home when I was a child. Once, a village opera troupe was performing. Zhang Shigui and Yuchi Gong came out, and just as the performance was getting exciting, watermelon rinds and clods of earth were thrown onto the stage from below. Even more, a burly man jumped onto the stage from below, grabbed Zhang Shigui and started beating him. By the time several people pulled them apart, the one who had been beaten could no longer stand up. Someone said to the one who had done the beating, "This is just a play, it's not real!" The man still replied indignantly, "If it were real, I would beat him to death." Naturally, the play could not continue, and that was the end of it; the telling of the story also ended with that. At the time, I was very bewildered, wondering if this kind of thing could really happen, if someone watching a play would really go on stage to beat the villainous traitor Zhang Shigui? I didn't know.</p>
<p>Later, I understood that this was a type of "rural behavior" common in the city, perhaps it would occur. In the city, encountering this kind of situation was different; the audience's reaction was to boo, and it was rare for anyone to go on stage to start beating someone. By comparison, it was much more "civilized."</p>
<p>The opposite of booing was applause. When Fuguihua came out and sang a passage, applause thundered throughout the hall; when the "Grand Western Chamber" reached "Stepping into the study door," applause also resounded, mixed with strange shouts of "Bravo!" "I say, brother!" the audience responded in unison. Mr. Black Button's storytelling in The Travels of Lao Ts'an was such that he scanned the entire hall, and even the listener sitting in the farthest corner felt that "Mr. Black Button saw me." This unison response, similarly, although it wasn't "Fuguihua calling me brother," was like "I got something for free from Fuguihua." Tong Zhiling was even more wonderful; without even opening her mouth, a glance and a slight movement of her body would bring forth strange cries of "Bravo!"</p>
<p>People are truly incomprehensible. Dressed in long gowns and leather shoes, acting politely, taking advantage of the dim lighting and the clamor of the crowd, they would actually emit tones so incompatible with their status. Even more strange is that people never seemed to feel any revulsion towards these sounds, considering them vulgar or belonging to the category of vulgar behavior. At most, they would look in that direction or smile. Perhaps everyone was originally seeking excitement, and was equally intoxicated in the excitement.</p>
<p>What I fear most is not these things, but the same methods being used in movie theaters: sometimes booing, sometimes applauding, and sometimes booing mixed with applauding. This scene often occurred when a villainous type of bad guy was suffering misfortune, or was being triumphant, or when a man and woman were kissing. Especially for the latter, booing was certain to occur every time, and even applauding was added. Perhaps only Freud could explain this kind of psychology!</p>
<p>Though the Zhang Shigui being beaten or booed on the stage was just an actor, he was still a living representative; when Fuguihua and Tong Zhiling were applauded and cheered, they would smile contentedly and retreat backstage, and the applauders or cheerers would also feel that their admiration was known, and that there was a "connection" in spirit. Only when shouting wildly at the screen and booing, knowing full well that the other party was completely unaware, then what was the purpose of it all?</p>
<p>There are many behaviors of mankind that cannot be explained; this is one of them.</p>
<p>Truly, "The difference between man and beast is slight." How are their acts of stupidity any better than a Sichuan dog barking at the sun or a fly crashing into glass? In terms of virtues, they are less peaceful than doves and less patient than sheep. Only in hypocrisy and affectation, pretending to be noble and kind, are they much more superior to all things, but what virtue is that! I would rather love the maggots that are certainly not clean, but never boast of their cleanliness. After a while, the entire theater became extremely quiet again. In the dim light, one could clearly see greasy yellow faces perched on stretched-out necks, saliva flowing back into the throat, slowly the chin hanging down, the mouth opening: completely enraptured. Who knows, under this very visage a strange cry or loud boo might erupt again.</p>
<p>I felt a desire to laugh but couldn't. I remembered a scene I saw not long ago in a Peking opera theater. The flirtatious acting of the "Killing the Son for Revenge" flower (female role), the monk kneeling and flirting, and the audience showing the same expressions as today.</p>
<p>"Nine out of ten women...</p>
<p>Are afraid your men will be too loose-lipped."</p>
<p>Applause thundered, mixed with strange cries, and occasional bursts of laughter. They sang on and on, until the monk was arrested, and before the female role even saw the official, Ah Gou pulled Ah Mao away, "It's almost over, there's nothing interesting coming up." They only saw "Killing the Son," but didn't see any "Revenge." The performers sang it this way, and the audience listened this way, but different from the arguments were the solemnly raised issues of education and life.</p>
<p>Theory and practice are often so different!</p>
<h3>Remembering Ma Gongyu</h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Whenever the three characters "Ma Gongyu" are mentioned, as long as you have lived in Shanghai and know a little about art, I don't think anyone would find them unfamiliar!</p>
<p>At a time when China's inherent arts—calligraphy, painting, etc.—are teetering on the brink of decline, he has already become an authority in the current calligraphy and painting world. He is not only a calligrapher, but also a painter and epigrapher. We can see his ink traces everywhere, especially in the official script (隶书), writing the Han dynasty Zhang Qian stele calligraphy with practiced ease, entering a realm of transformation, being vigorous and robust, and exceptionally full of spirit. Besides calligraphy, there are also his paintings and carvings, which almost everyone admires.</p>
<p>Of medium height, his back slightly bent, with a round, upright face, and full of vigor, he wears a pair of black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose. What attracts the most attention are his long, black whiskers, floating in front of his chest. His demeanor of a famous scholar makes people look at him with respect. Undoubtedly, when people see him, it's clear that he is a completely authentic, ancient scholar preserving the essence of Chinese culture. However, you might not believe that he used to be an English teacher at many schools before the war, and had a considerable understanding of Shakespeare. Before the war, he was an old professor in the Chinese department of Great China University. At the beginning of the war against Japan, the school moved inland, but due to various reasons, he did not follow the school to the interior, but secluded himself on the sea, maintaining his consistent style of a famous scholar, asking nothing and hearing nothing. Although the enemy repeatedly threatened and lured him, he was never moved. He lived a poor and honest life, and passed these long days with a clean conscience.</p>
<p>Generally, a learned person often likes humor and wit. In a recent speech by Mr. Ma, we can see his humorous and witty style, as well as his artistic thoughts.</p>
<p>He said, "Chinese art is worthy of praise, and absolutely cannot be easily imitated by others, because it has an independent prototype. The brilliant culture of five thousand years has only created this crystallization."</p>
<p>"Let's take writing as an example. China uses square characters, which cannot be compared to the phonetic scripts of other countries. They are the only type of script in the world. The reason why China will not perish should also be attributed to the preservation and transmission of square characters. Although we lost our country twice in the Yuan and Qing dynasties, not only did the writing not perish, but it assimilated the foreign races, and the country recovered. Therefore, Chinese art is worthy of pride and can conquer others. Speaking of traditional Chinese painting, foreigners often find it strange and want to learn it, but unless they start learning from five thousand years ago, it will not be easy to learn."</p>
<p>After hearing Mr. Ma's words, I think that those who blindly believe in Westernization will have some understanding!</p>
<h3>Roads (Two Poems)</h3>
<p>One Wang Jiande</p>
<p>This is a long road, stretching so far that no one can see its end.</p>
<p>The road surface is sometimes flat, sometimes rugged; there is grass beside the road, and also thorns.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, countless people pass through here, walking towards the end of the road. Among them, some have light and brisk steps, others have hesitant and awkward steps; some sing joyfully, others groan sadly. But they never stop, walking towards the end of the road. No one has ever seen anyone come back.</p>
<p>I don't know from what day, I found myself joining their ranks, walking forward. I feel that this road is not easy to walk; I want to turn back, but behind me is a long, crowded line. I have no choice but to drag my heavy steps and continue forward.</p>
<p>Now, I feel tired, unable to rest, unable to get help, and even unable to get the warmth of friendship, because everyone is a traveler on this road, and all have a long journey ahead!</p>
<p>Two Ming</p>
<p>Roads stretch forward, crossing one mountain after another, never ending. She shows a proud spirit, spreading across every place on earth, using her body to serve as the only great tool for communicating culture and commerce.</p>
<p>Roads fear rivers the most. When a small river cuts across her, the road and the bridge become two friends sharing hardships.</p>
<p>I love "roads". On summer nights, I love to wander on quiet, deserted roads until dewdrops form in my hair.</p>
<p>"Roads are trampled out by people," ancient philosophers said long ago. There were originally no roads on barren mountains. Every day, hunters go up to hunt, woodcutters go up to chop wood, eternally following in the footsteps of their predecessors, and gradually, a road appears. Roads are trampled out by people.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think about why the "road to national construction" has not yet been completed, it is because everyone has not worked together to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, walking the roads that are just taking shape!</p>
<p>Every day, I pray to the road:</p>
<p>Let us walk out of a broad and smooth "road"! …</p>
<h3>The Deeds of Dr. Bu Fangji, Late President of St. John's University</h3>
<p>— Cai Zheng</p>
<p>The teacher's surname was Bu, his given name was Fangji, and he was a native of New York State in the United States. Born into a respected family, he was pure in nature. He studied at Columbia University, and at the age of nineteen, received a Bachelor of Arts degree. His literary talent already shone brightly, and his studies became even more diligent. Soon he transferred to the New York Theological Seminary to become a Bachelor of Divinity, studying extensively and thoroughly, exhausting the profound mysteries. His family was originally wealthy, and he further enhanced his reputation, but the teacher did not aspire to gain advancement by unworthy means, but single-mindedly devoted himself to teaching. Undaunted by hardships, he came to China from afar, completely shedding his former attire and customs, and adopting our customs. He first mastered the language, then studied the classics and commentaries, and was able to recite them fluently, without any hesitation. At first, the Episcopal Church had a benefactor who established a school on the sea, and chose the former site of the Brahma temple. Gathering thirty-nine students, this became St. John's University. In the beginning, they believed that the teacher's benevolence was sufficient to lead others, and his integrity was sufficient to manage affairs, so they invited him with courtesy, and appointed him to lead the school. The teacher took office resolutely and decisively, with detailed arrangements, respectfully adhering to the principle of tireless instruction, hoping to achieve the effect of skillful guidance. At that time, scholars were obscured by their attachments, and their learning was far from being practical. The teacher was saddened by this, and used his knowledge to teach orally, explaining the origins and ends, hoping for thorough understanding. Thereupon, those who came from all directions flocked to him, drawn by his reputation and responding to his call. The joy of teaching and learning was as close as father and son. Over the past fifty years, he successively established colleges of arts, sciences, medicine, engineering, etc., expanded the land by more than two hundred acres, and built school buildings. Libraries, science halls, laboratories, gymnasiums, and recreation rooms were all fully equipped, a grand scale was established, and it became a prestigious academy. The teacher himself said that he spent his life begging for the school. Every time he returned to his homeland, he sought donations in every possible way, and came back with funds, often for construction. But later, construction projects increased, and he also raised funds locally. The people of the country were grateful and admired him, and competed to contribute. Therefore, President Li Yuanhong awarded him the Third Class Chiaho Medal for his contribution to civilizing and transforming the people in our country. Trinity College in New York and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland both awarded him honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees. The Episcopal Church also requisitioned him to be a bishop, to manage all church affairs in Anhui Province, but he declined the appointment because he had dedicated himself to the school. Even after the age of seventy, he personally managed all the affairs, without any relaxation. It can be said that his conduct was consistent, from beginning to end. During the Japanese invasion, the teacher was in America, and he was still concerned about his old work, making plans. When he returned after the war, and saw that the school buildings were as before, and the students were still studying diligently, his heart was filled with joy, which overflowed in his words. He said to those around him, "Returning to this old place is no different from returning home. I will spend my old age in this country, and my wish will be fulfilled!" How could he have known that after living peacefully for four months, he suddenly suffered a serious illness, and passed away in the third month of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China (1947). He was eighty-three years old. When the news of his death arrived, tens of thousands of students sent their condolences from afar, and those who were near the mourning hall all said that although the wise man had passed away, his virtuous words remained. We should promote the teacher's spirit, and jointly strive for immortal achievements. Because Zheng Hua was in the same school under the teacher, and personally received his teachings, I was ordered to record his words and deeds, and present them to the historians, for their careful selection!</p>
<h3>Beginning-to-Believe Peak of Mount Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>The strange peaks of the back sea of Mount Huangshan are as dense as swords and halberds. The most famous is the Beginning-to-Believe Peak. The two peaks are about two zhang apart, and are connected by a stone structure. There is a pine tree at the bridgehead, with a branch extending horizontally as long as the bridge. Tourists hold onto it to move forward along the bridge, and it is called the Greeting Pine.</p>
<h3>Dirge</h3>
<p>— E. Allan Poe, translated into English; Peiyin, retranslated</p>
<p>This article is one of the ancient Greek poems, originally published in the tenth volume of The Complete Works of E. Allan Poe. It was translated into English by Mr. Poe and is one of Mr. Poe's introductions to Greek literary works. It is now specifically retranslated as follows.</p>
<p>——Translator</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>How shall we read this epitaph?</p>
<p>How shall we sing this tragic song?</p>
<p>For this deceased, adorable departed,</p>
<p>What kind of requiem shall we sing?</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Her friends gaze at her,</p>
<p>Gaze at her ornately adorned bier,</p>
<p>And weep—oh! Actually using hypocritical</p>
<p>Tears to humiliate a dead girl.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>They loved her for her wealth—</p>
<p>They hated her for her arrogance—</p>
<p>As she gradually became feeble,</p>
<p>They loved her—therefore she died.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>They tell me (as they discuss</p>
<p>Her "valuable, embroidered shroud")</p>
<p>That my voice has become hoarse—</p>
<p>I should no longer sing.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Or that my tone should</p>
<p>Turn into such solemn songs,</p>
<p>So tragic—so sad,</p>
<p>That the dead will not feel regret.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>Now she has gone to heaven</p>
<p>Carrying young hopes with her.</p>
<p>And I am intoxicated by love for the dead,</p>
<p>She is my bride.</p>
<p>(VII)</p>
<p>Belonging to death—she lies dead</p>
<p>Her whole body adorned with incense,</p>
<p>Her eyes marked by death,</p>
<p>Life still lingering in her hair.</p>
<p>(VIII)</p>
<p>Thus, I knock on the coffin</p>
<p>Loudly and lingeringly—vague melody</p>
<p>Echoing in the gray hut, answering my song,</p>
<p>Harmonizing with my singing.</p>
<p>(IX)</p>
<p>You died in the June of your life—</p>
<p>But you did not die miraculously;</p>
<p>You did not die suddenly,</p>
<p>Nor did you pass with a peaceful death.</p>
<p>(X)</p>
<p>From countless worldly friends</p>
<p>Your life and love were shattered,</p>
<p>Mingling with the eternal gathering of</p>
<p>Countless angels in heaven——</p>
<p>(XI)</p>
<p>Therefore, for you this evening</p>
<p>There will be no requiem,</p>
<p>Only sing and dance for you, as you ascend,</p>
<p>With an old song of joy.</p>
<p>(Written in 1947)</p>
<h3>A Story of the Kazakhs</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Ma Zixiang, the chairman of Qinghai, knew that the Kazakhs were highly skilled in horsemanship and had a strong national character. He wanted to settle these minority compatriots scattered within Qinghai, give them appropriate training, and contribute to the country's all-out war effort. He also knew that the Kazakhs, besides their religion—Islam, usually represented by the "scripture box" worn on their chest—cherished their women and children the most. Women were difficult to manage, so what about the sons? He set up a good primary school in Xining, using education as a pretext to take their beloved sons as "hostages," and then proceed step by step.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Kazakhs, who could sing beautiful vocal music and were both simple and intelligent, had already seen through this plan and immediately planned to resist. At this time, the central government, in order to develop the Great Northwest, sent a team of radio talents to the Qaidam Basin. Mr. Pu Wenfeng was assigned to be the person in charge of entertaining them along the way. When they, a group of dozens of people, camped in one place, they happened to encounter a beautiful moonlit night. After eating and drinking, everyone became excited and couldn't help but sing and laugh loudly. Suddenly, a Kazakh woman came from a dusty place—this Caucasian type of woman suited everyone's temperament.</p>
<p>At that time, these prairie travelers, three parts drunk, did something with this beauty, and we can imagine what it was. Adding excitement to the revelry, this woman also played along. When the moon set, the stars dimmed, and the wind was high and the slumber was sweet, this woman secretly slipped away. The people in several tents fell asleep after extreme revelry. The Kazakhs, who had been lurking in the grass, suddenly walked quickly to the side of the tent, drew their knives, first chopped the tent poles, and then, with a dense formation, stepped on the four sides and chopped at the center together!</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Mr. Pu, who was sent to accompany us, said, "If I hadn't suddenly needed to urinate and ran out of the tent to relieve myself, I would have gone to see the Bodhisattva of the Earth King with these many specialized talents cultivated by the country for many years! Let me tell you all," he continued, "I was still naked when I ran all the way to the government headquarters! Of course, Chairman Ma's original plan was never carried out because of this!"</p>
<p>It is said that the recent Xinjiang incident was led by the Kazakhs.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Gypsies</h3>
<p>— Cai Xue</p>
<p>India seems to be the homeland of the Gypsies. The language they speak is one of the Indian dialects, which evolved from Sanskrit. They are descendants of the Dravidians, who were conquered by the Aryans and became their slaves. Around the time of Jesus' birth, they broke away from their shackles and began their nomadic life.</p>
<p>They lived in the Balkan Peninsula for hundreds of years and learned many ways to do business. Their language added many Greek and Slavic words. Their religious beliefs and customs were greatly influenced, and they even abandoned their original Taoist religion. Because they lived in the Balkans for a long time, some people mistakenly thought that this was their ancestral home.</p>
<p>The number of Gypsies gradually increased. The Balkan nobles treated them as slaves, making them do everything from cutting firewood, mining, and even cooking and taking care of children. Until the nineteenth century, they were still enslaved in Romania. But their love of freedom was too strong, and those who refused to be slaves fled to the mountainous areas, where they formed bands under their own chieftains and engaged in robbery. Those who were caught were of course beheaded, but they were also well organized. Later, the situation deteriorated even further, and they had to emigrate to Western Europe. They were still led by chieftains, who dressed very impressively, but their subordinates lived in tents and could not help but steal. They claimed to be devout Christians, expelled from Egypt by the Turks. The name "Gypsy" originated from this.</p>
<p>They have been to Paris, spread to England and Spain, and even Norway, Sweden, and Finland are their worlds. At first, everyone did not pay much attention, but later they became alarmed. Prussia was the first to prohibit them from entering the country, otherwise they would be hanged. But they would find a place to settle down. In fact, they are also very lovely, and their temperament is somewhat like children. Danger only arises when they are forced to a dead end. Austria once changed its attitude and treated them well, wanting to set up a colony for them. Although the plan was not successful, countries gradually changed their discriminatory attitudes towards them.</p>
<p>At the end of the eighteenth century, a German named Grellmann wrote a book proving that the Gypsies migrated from India. People then became interested in this long-despised ethnic group and began to study their lives. Novelists and playwrights also used them as subjects, describing their nomadic lives, freedom, and lack of restraint. This friendly praise confused the Gypsies, but it did reduce their fear. However, there were still some among them who liked to live a wandering life. Unless it was in the cold winter, they would temporarily settle indoors, but once spring warmed up, they would all set out on expeditions again.</p>
<p>If you treat Gypsies with sincerity, they will treat you with sincerity. Among them, there are also doctors, lawyers, engineers, and artists. They are full of talent, especially for music and dance. According to police investigations, Gypsies have never committed major crimes, only minor accidents, some of which are simply making trouble for no reason.</p>
<p>Before the war, many people wanted to modernize them by opening schools, publishing newspapers, and establishing theaters, and the results were not bad. During the war, they were also very active, resisting the Germans and sheltering prisoners. Therefore, the Germans killed more than 10,000 Gypsies in Auschwitz overnight. It is said that in 1939, there were about 1.5 million Gypsies in Europe, but not many are left now. The Gypsies in France are calling for everyone to unite completely.</p>
<h3>Birdkeeping and "Door Birds"</h3>
<p>— Ai Yinxuan</p>
<p>——Let's Look at Zheng Banqiao's Perspective</p>
<p>The City God Temple in this city recently held a yellow bird competition, with participants from twenty-seven units including Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Luodian. There were over six hundred yellow birds, indicating a great many enthusiasts of this pursuit.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, birdkeeping can be considered a refined pastime. The birds' melodious songs, beautiful plumage, and delicate yet lively姿態 indeed bring joy to the heart and pleasure to the senses. However, if birds are fattened up solely for fighting, taking pleasure in seeing them wounded and maimed in self-destructive combat, it is undeniably somewhat cruel.</p>
<p>Birdfighting is a pastime similar to cockfighting and cricket fighting, enjoyed by people from young children to white-haired elders, often leading to lavish gambling and financial ruin. According to the bird owners participating in the City God Temple's birdfighting competition this time, there was no gambling involved; it was purely for the sake of local pride and prestige. This so-called pride and prestige stems from a desire to win; people naturally have a competitive spirit, but when this spirit expands, it often manifests as cruelty, as exemplified by birdfighting.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, keeping birds in cages is already extremely unnatural. Zheng Banqiao, in discussing birdkeeping with his younger brother, said: "Throughout my life, I have most disliked birds in cages. I seek entertainment, while they are imprisoned. Where is the reason or logic in that? Why must I bend the nature of things to suit my own?" He later added: "What I mean by not keeping birds in cages is not that I don't love birds, but that there is a proper way to care for them. If you want to keep birds, it's best to plant many trees, so that hundreds of branches near your house are lush and dense, forming a bird kingdom and a bird home. At dawn, when you first awaken from sleep, listen to a chorus of chirping, like the music of Yunmen and Xianchi. When you get up, wash your face, and sip tea, watch them spread their wings and display their colors, flitting back and forth, keeping your eyes busy. This is far more enjoyable than the pleasure of a single bird in a cage." (See Banqiao's Family Letters) This should be the most perfect way to keep birds. Even without mentioning "cherishing things" or "loving life," it is a kind of poetic interest and a way of life as an art.</p>
<p>In fact, in the vast universe, there are countless things to do. As Su Dongpo said: "Paying attention to things often leads to pleasure." If we broaden our interests, everything in the world can bring us joy. Why limit ourselves to birdkeeping? And why even limit ourselves to birdfighting?</p>
<h3>Lu Ming in the Film "Su Feng Ji"</h3>
<h3>Prevalent Urban Diseases</h3>
<p>— Baker</p>
<p>The Epidemic Prevention Committee announced on the 13th that epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and smallpox are spreading in the city. Last month, there were 113 cases of cerebrospinal meningitis and 458 cases of smallpox. As of the 10th of this month, there have been 13 cases of the former and 115 cases of the latter. The statistics for these two diseases are likely only from the Epidemic Prevention Committee's own prevention and treatment efforts. Judging by the extent of the spread, the actual numbers are likely far greater. We know that both diseases are especially easily transmitted to young children. As far as this writer knows, more than one child in the neighborhood has already died from these two diseases. This phenomenon really needs attention.</p>
<p>However, these two diseases are only epidemic. As for tuberculosis and venereal diseases, those are even more so urban diseases. Recently, the Tuberculosis Prevention Association warned citizens to prevent tuberculosis and to raise funds to help treat it. This newspaper is also conducting free tuberculosis screenings, which is quite meaningful and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>The severity of urban diseases is naturally related to the population and living environment. Aside from venereal diseases, which are largely spread by the four thousand-plus prostitutes, the dense urban population, polluted air, unsuitable living conditions, and sewage problems are objective causes of tuberculosis and epidemic diseases. From the perspective of urban hygiene and national health, we are deeply concerned about these prevalent urban diseases.</p>
<p>However, when we shift our gaze from epidemic diseases to social urban diseases, we find that the latter's spread is even wider and its harm even more frightening. We feel that these social diseases need to be prevented and treated even more urgently than epidemic diseases.</p>
<p>These social epidemics are nothing other than unemployment, labor disputes, and unrest. The current unemployment situation is even more serious than last year. Businesses, shops, and organizations are all laying off employees, such as the recent closure of gold and silver shops and the dismissal of printing workers at the Zhonghua Book Company. As for labor disputes, since the decontrol of the cost of living, there have been many conflicts over discounts and base salaries. What is even more worrying are the social phenomena of strikes, marches, and other unrest. It is recently known that leaders from all walks of life in this city have formed a Social Security Promotion Association to seek social stability and solve unemployment and other problems. We hope they can truly begin their work and eradicate today's social urban diseases as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Old Lu still wants to be a man, I can't swallow this!" Crippled Lu still shouted loudly without any reservations, "I've decided not to run! I don't want to lead people to run anymore! Whoever has the courage, please follow me! Let's go up and fight with the army, at least try to fight those dwarfs! It's better than dying dirty and miserably on the highway or in the train; it's cleaner!"</p>
<p>Lu's unexpected speech stirred almost everyone in the theater. More than half of them immediately raised their hands and shouted, "I'll follow you, Old Lu!" The rest were also eager to try, but hesitant about what they could do at the front.</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own will, Old Lu will never force anyone," Crippled Lu added.</p>
<p>"Very good, very good," Zhu Zhaonian nodded repeatedly. "The country has come to this point, and we can only fight on our own. After I send Feifei to Nandan, I might come back immediately and join you. I've always wanted to try the Japanese Type 38 rifle; maybe this is an opportunity!"</p>
<p>"That would be even better; we'll be waiting for you!" Crippled Lu and several young people shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Old Zhu picked up the suitcase on the ground and looked again at the back of Crippled Lu, who was limping away. He felt very happy that this precocious young man, burdened with deep melancholy, had not lost his original spirit after all. But at the same time, he felt sad. Under such insufficient conditions, these young people, disregarding everything, turning back to fight, the result was predictable.</p>
<p>It was the movement of Feifei on his back that woke him up, finally making him lift his heavy steps and start walking out of the station. Several people wanted to see him off, but he declined them all.</p>
